[0:21:01] suzyq1503: I found a new recipe app. it‚Äôs called cherrypick. Made an amazing veg chilli last night and I suck at cooking (can literally burn water). but everyone loved it!

[0:24:22] Layliah79: I love the shorts!
[0:24:30] Layliah79: going to get those glasses today :D
[0:24:42] s7wede: Yeah there was a time when it got super intrusive, but now they have seemed to find a good balance
[0:24:44] Lausten: I wish shorts would only show up on mobile
[0:25:03] SlithTheSivak: @MrGM Have you watched Delicious in Dungeon on Netflix?
[0:25:14] s7wede: TV version of youtube is mobile since it's ANdroid based
[0:25:26] Xrxiz: modified youtube to not show shorts at all....
[0:26:07] SlithTheSivak: society grew up a bit
[0:26:08] s7wede: Yeah inbetweeners and even earlier shows like Men Behaving Badly
[0:26:23] Haestoh: The Thorpe Park episode kills me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[0:26:47] Haestoh: or the ‚ÄúI am a man, who has recently bought a house in the local area.‚Äù
[0:27:56] Haestoh: anyone around 30 in the UK lived that experience. I was in sixth form when the inbetweeners came out
[0:28:23] 324bee21: wait the random manuscript isn‚Äôt account wide?
[0:28:25] Thoreya: pretty cool race
[0:28:39] BBMezzy: There's a couple more challenging ones but in general it's easy
[0:28:57] BBMezzy: Races have only gotten easier since the original Kalimdor races
[0:29:07] 324bee21: has to be a bug right?
[0:29:08] Big_Rum: Good morning.. Can we talk about the hair? whats going on
[0:29:24] SlithTheSivak: mohawk!
[0:29:24] Big_Rum: ahh
[0:29:28] Lausten: Its his new style
[0:29:36] Big_Rum: Uncle cuts your hair yeah
[0:30:48] Haestoh: exciting times!!!
[0:31:14] SlithTheSivak: yaaaas
[0:31:34] SlithTheSivak: blizz dev "Hello UK!"
[0:31:39] BBMezzy: As long as it's streamed for us non-UK folks :p Would be really cool
[0:31:48] SlithTheSivak: crowd: goes wild

[0:31:57] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: Hey GM, do you know if anything special happens if you reclaim Gilneas on a Worgen character?
[0:32:47] Chesscape: yeah, you need to steal the flowers from Liams grave
[0:33:07] Big_Rum: Its came It finally came!!!!! Just got my Auspicious Arborwyrm!!!!
[0:33:21] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:34:14] BBMezzy: razorthorn / blade's edge race required retries for me
[0:34:16] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: The ad break caused me to miss whatever you said GM if you responded to my question
[0:35:07] JakeSezz: How goes the Outland Cup?
[0:35:24] Paranigmayt: can i get there after i completed it once?
[0:36:51] lyreilla: Same(
[0:37:04] spencer_zero_: Razorthorn is just awful, struggled with it a lot;.
[0:37:25] laurab28291: does anyone know where to get the gilneas tabard is? SW vendor isnt there :(
[0:37:49] JakeSezz: So, my follower dungeon healing trial went surprisingly well! Had 1 death, no wipes. But damn if Capt Garrick isn‚Äôt a badass cuz she heals herself and teammates whilst tanking mrgmDance
[0:37:51] Arlaeya: Oh!!! maybe!
[0:38:14] BBMezzy: I think with the amount of work they have to do for all mounts it would be unlikely to add an additional level of work to it
[0:38:50] laurab28291: and have you got the manuscript of infinite possibilities? i have collected it but ATT has not registered it xD
[0:38:52] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[0:38:56] BBMezzy: Ah, well maybe
[0:39:01] Paranigmayt: The quest in the jounrey is gone so i have to travel on my own to gilneas i thin
[0:39:04] Paranigmayt: k
[0:39:24] Tauren0309: Hi Dan, who you doing today...
[0:39:28] necrowoof: i was hoping i could mine and herb on my mount in old content
[0:39:29] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: I wonder why the thunder gryphon has 4 flying bubbles instead of 8.
[0:39:49] Tauren0309: Glad you can read Tauren
[0:40:20] Arlaeya: @Paranigmayt If Alliance (I haven't done it on Horde yet) you can find Genn in SW harbor and you get a lift)
[0:40:48] Paranigmayt: doing the quest with an alt but thanks man :)
[0:41:00] spencer_zero_: Reminds me of how far Heelvsbabyface sank.
[0:41:09] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: Nope. Only 4
[0:41:16] JakeSezz: Taliesin said that if he ever goes off the rails that way, we know he‚Äôs doing it for the money tneTali mrgmHehe
[0:41:28] spencer_zero_: Nah, he's only posting videos about how everything is "woke".
[0:42:19] laurab28291: keep close to the ground :D
[0:42:19] spencer_zero_: HVB had some genuinely good WoW content back in the day, now he's on the alt-right grift racket.
[0:42:21] BBMezzy: The last minute change to dragonriding mounts for chars that can't ride yet is funny, saw a stream where they were mounted on their dragonriding mount in a dungeon
[0:42:26] fetza108: Sadge
[0:42:53] JakeSezz: fOoKiNG PrOnoUnS
[0:43:29] spencer_zero_: gEnDeR aMbiGuitY
[0:43:47] databob1: Well it was a hilarious meme.
[0:44:02] BBMezzy: Yup!
[0:44:28] Tauren0309: Dan a Disney Question - If you have one day to go to a park in Disney Land Paris which one will you go for?
[0:44:28] NateOliveiras: Is this speed bar an addon or an aura?
[0:44:28] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: Do the dungeons followers work with timewalking?
[0:44:34] JakeSezz: Yeah it was pretty damn funny. Show‚Äôs how bad people have lost the plot cuz damn
[0:45:15] spencer_zero_: HVB is a northerner, no wonder he went off the rails.
[0:45:36] spencer_zero_: Every northerner goes to pot after a long enough time. LUL
[0:45:45] Tauren0309: Thanks man
[0:45:46] Big_Rum: Speaking of Disney we are booking a trip to Disn world in Sept! Super Excited
[0:46:04] JakeSezz: My SIL got that special Disney medal for doing the marathons at Disneyland, Disneyworld, and Disneyland Paris all in one year
[0:46:35] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: I‚Äôve been to Disney World 2-3 times. Haven‚Äôt been to Disney Land though
[0:46:38] spencer_zero_: I still can't figure out Taliesin's accent, he's definitely a southerner though.
[0:46:59] JakeSezz: sister in law
[0:47:56] Larkaro: When I first saw Baby Face I thought it was Preach
[0:48:52] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:48:57] Puhg: He's been streaming Baldur's Gate III hard core.
[0:49:27] databob1: I liked loki season 2
[0:49:29] aragarde: that man is crazy
[0:49:30] spencer_zero_: I bet if you asked these people what they mean by "woke", none of them will be able to tell you.
[0:49:53] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:50:00] JakeSezz: So, Starfield and it‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùgender politics‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù is too much and yet BG3 isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwoke trash‚Äù mrgmO Can‚Äôt make this shit up
[0:50:19] DevoidX: to good people
[0:50:20] databob1: A few women and a black woman too... THE HORROR
[0:50:28] MediumRareOG: "Woke" now simply means "something I, as a conservative, don't like"
[0:50:30] spencer_zero_: It's absolutely a buzz word, used by people on the right as a blanket term to describe anything they disagree with.
[0:50:33] Larkaro: I feel like he would call the kiss in wow, gay or something because its woke
[0:50:36] DevoidX: to good people, 'woke' is a compliment, imho
[0:50:40] databob1: No the kiss in wow was cute
[0:50:49] Arlaeya: I am so happy the tech now exists and the endless possibilities! re: kiss
[0:50:59] Xesol: if video games are hurting peoples feelings they need to step away lol
[0:51:05] JakeSezz: I‚Äôm sure there are people pissed about it. Same ones who bleat on about ‚Äúno war in Warcraft‚Äù
[0:51:19] Wynem: the advance races are a pain, some of them i beat by over 3 seconds and some im 5 seconds to slow
[0:51:24] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:49] OrdinaryOlly: Lets face it nothing he says has any meaning as they are just saying it to be relevent
[0:51:49] Thoreya: oh god
[0:51:59] adampanerabread: oh i tuned in at the perfect time
[0:52:04] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: TotalBiscuit was one of my favorite youtubers. It sucks that he‚Äôs gone. He did a lot for the gaming community.
[0:52:10] Thoreya: i dont even watch him anymore, glad hes making some sense every now and then
[0:52:22] StreamElements: Reclaiming GILNEAS in 10.2.5! Complete Story Playthrough & Rewards - https://youtu.be/C-QpageNFY0
[0:52:23] MediumRareOG: "Woke" originated from AAVE to mean "aware of racial injustice" and later expanded to include LGBTQIA+
[0:52:50] adampanerabread: so it's confirmed no yellow or black scales right?
[0:52:58] Thoreya: rip
[0:53:00] databob1: Kissing your wife that so gay... just a joke not serious
[0:53:15] JakeSezz: Legit, Asmon‚Äôs best content was the reaction to the hardcore WoW death vids. That shit would crack me up
[0:53:16] Arlaeya: @MediumRareOG Thank you for saving me all that typing, lol! well put
[0:53:21] BBMezzy: Isolated by itself I thought the cinematic was fine, in the context of DF there's been a bit too much sappy dialogue going on
[0:53:26] magemaster225: kiss was fine, the hug was too far /s
[0:53:43] spencer_zero_: I liked the Gilneas storyline, it was decent.
[0:53:48] amricatt: I was pleasantly surprised by the kiss.  It made Tyrande seem less robotic.
[0:53:54] Larkaro: Tess's face model was chef's kiss
[0:54:39] handovdoom666: @MediumRareOG can't wait for that word to die a horrible death. the minute someone uses that word in an argument, I tune out.
[0:54:42] MediumRareOG: that's giving "stay on target" Death Star vibes
[0:54:53] spencer_zero_: Tess' model looks gorgeous.
[0:55:24] spencer_zero_: You're not supposed to tell us how the sausage is made, Dan!
[0:55:35] BBMezzy: Haha
[0:55:43] Lausten: I feel decieved now
[0:55:49] SlithTheSivak: But it was too late, I'd already seen everything
[0:56:01] amricatt: Welp, there goes the magic.
[0:56:18] Arlaeya: @handovdoom666 they replaced "politically correct" with woke. they like buzzwords for their bigotry

[0:56:40] grump42: lol
[0:56:42] adampanerabread: uploading
[0:56:45] Wynem: jynxed it
[0:56:45] Haestoh: hahahahahaha
[0:56:54] spencer_zero_: "This is the gold run", he lied massively.
[0:57:01] SlithTheSivak: @Lausten i thought those were documentaries about friendship
[0:57:08] MediumRareOG: @Arlaeya What's funny is when you accuse them of not knowing waht it means they say "that's ridiculous, of course i know. you know it when you see it"
[0:57:30] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak Family* LUL
[0:57:58] SlithTheSivak: gah!
[0:58:43] spencer_zero_: Tess looks amazing though!
[0:58:45] DevoidX: google magic eraser!

[0:58:54] SlithTheSivak: Tes is now Queen! Yaas Taas!
[0:59:03] amricatt: Should've ditched Genn.  He's old news.
[0:59:34] calphan84: did you know in before the storm genn greymane suggested to anduin he should marry tess
[0:59:47] spencer_zero_: When he said to her, "This is your kingdom now" or whatever, that gave me Genn death flags for next expansion.
[0:59:57] JakeSezz: The future‚Äôs now, old man mrgmHehe
[1:00:09] databob1: So Tessa is part of the rogue order hall right? Genn turned his kingdom to the rogues
[1:00:25] BBMezzy: He's manduin now
[1:00:28] Larkaro: Andy WIN
[1:00:43] Paranigmayt: Tried to get the toy on my horde char.. didnt get it there :/
[1:00:51] ShineyFighter: GG
[1:00:51] Arlaeya: I'm worried about Genn honestly. but I was worried about Khadgar at the end of SL and he's still kicking, lol
[1:00:58] Demontemplar: \o/
[1:01:00] kloofman: wolrd record
[1:01:02] handovdoom666: I WAS HERE
[1:01:07] MediumRareOG: i don't have the patience for dagon races
[1:01:12] Arlaeya: woot!! That's my task for tonight!
[1:01:13] spencer_zero_: Khadgar might not be long for this world either.
[1:01:17] ShineyFighter: also i feel since hes king it would be full name & titles all the time.
[1:01:38] RAF_Sean: Good morning sir
[1:01:46] DevoidX: dude. 'King'
[1:02:11] spencer_zero_: Turns out King Charles is actually a chill dude.
[1:02:17] spencer_zero_: In that video.
[1:02:42] spencer_zero_: Turns out he's just a dude.
[1:02:46] amricatt: As an American, I feel like Charles would have to be so chill after waiting SO long to be King.
[1:02:57] RAF_Sean: Just a regular dude, taking a regular walk around his regular castle
[1:02:57] ShineyFighter: a slow news day is a good day.
[1:03:25] GolferTV: queen chareles is still alive?
[1:03:32] MediumRareOG: And then there's Prince Andrew...
[1:03:37] Wynem: he looked like an old farmer the way he dressed
[1:03:55] spencer_zero_: Elizabeth is dead, we have a new queen now. First male queen in 70 odd years.
[1:03:55] ShineyFighter: i wonder if King Chareles has knowlage on bikes?
[1:04:04] JakeSezz: I mean, you can‚Äôt expect any sort of royalty to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, right?
[1:04:16] RAF_Sean: I met William and Kate on their "honeymoon"
[1:04:27] RAF_Sean: We escorted them on the ship from Montreal to Quebec city
[1:04:41] bwoods79: I'm sure he is better on a bike than biden
[1:04:43] MachoCham: Magaluf
[1:04:47] RAF_Sean: They spent the night onboard the ship with us and we took them up the St. Lawrence river
[1:04:53] Thoreya: saw on the news this morning princess kate got abdominal surgery
[1:05:02] RAF_Sean: Yeah Nayv
[1:05:05] RAF_Sean: Navy*
[1:05:06] spencer_zero_: I bet behind the scenes, Charles, etc are all a bunch of lads.
[1:05:22] spencer_zero_: I mean, Andrew went to a Pizza Express. Allegedly.
[1:05:35] MachoCham: Think they could cure her from being a stuck up cunt whilst she's in?
[1:06:04] spencer_zero_: It's so specific lol
[1:06:04] MachoCham: Your dad signed a plaque on the wall?
[1:06:08] bwoods79: You said you are going for a haircut, you should change it up, surprise us tomorrow
[1:06:09] ShineyFighter: imagen having to sign a plack each time you just want some nosh?
[1:06:28] spencer_zero_: It's like something Alan Partridge would say, "I went to a Pizza Express in Woking."
[1:06:34] Nicklau5: What server are you on?
[1:06:46] MediumRareOG: Woking is posh Slough
[1:07:11] spencer_zero_: I bet some people voted brexit thinking we'd get our own servers on WoW.

[1:17:10] Big_Rum: Cham you gonna stay up and what the Chiefs game?
[1:17:19] amricatt: That will really help getting a home.
[1:17:20] ShineyFighter: dont ask her but make her worrie that you feel you have no way to pay it, so she might end up suggest your idea so if its her idea you feel less bad about it.
[1:17:21] RAF_Sean: Life changing really
[1:17:29] handovdoom666: use logic with her: if you don't pay the tax bill you'll go to jail and you won't need a house.
[1:17:29] RAF_Sean: Oh I have one of those!
[1:17:41] RAF_Sean: Ours is propane and it does our heating and hot water
[1:17:44] BBMezzy: 40k is a huge difference

[1:19:59] RAF_Sean: So will you stream less when you‚Äôre the only parent at home?
[1:20:03] JakeSezz: Now, maybe it‚Äôs because of my personality, but I think if you were just straight up & honest, it‚Äôd work out. Just say that you‚Äôre gonna have to tweak the plans & expectations for using the rest for a house
[1:20:03] MediumRareOG: There's a great clip of TimeTheTatman saying Asmon is great at just talking and he tunes into his stream to show chat at the worst possible time. It's hilarious
[1:20:04] MachoCham: Can you ask them to do your jail term after beta finishes up?

[1:21:32] Haestoh: for the bants
[1:21:43] ShineyFighter: im shocked you dont make notes of this kinda thing.
[1:21:45] handovdoom666: and then another GoFundMe to pay the taxes on that GoFundMe
[1:22:16] MachoCham: Sometimes it's either you put money aside for the tax bill or you don't eat
[1:22:18] MachoCham: *shrug*

[1:24:54] ShineyFighter: i wonder how close dragon flying is to the flying in guildwars2?
[1:25:23] JakeSezz: Basically
[1:25:26] Kyocere: while the IRS knows all along what you owe, yes
[1:25:33] Kyocere: they still make us do it
[1:25:39] NeeK_23: not to derail the convo, but evokers cant soar these races now can they?
[1:25:41] WhiteJester420: Yea, you have to figure out all your own shit, and can get arrested if you fuck it up too badly. There are tax perp places that will do it for ya tho
[1:25:42] chefdejour82: yes and then you have to wait a long time for the return
[1:25:42] Arlaeya: unfortunately, that is correct. Keeps the tax preparers paid here
[1:25:45] NateOliveiras: In Brazil we have the website for it too. It's pretty simple
[1:25:48] RAF_Sean: Canada is like that too. We send it in and they correct it

[1:25:57] BBMezzy: In the netherlands the government tells us what we owe after we confirm how much we made in the previous year
[1:25:58] switchh72: Always found it mental how the American Tax System works
[1:26:06] MediumRareOG: The US is no different. You can say something is an expense and the IRS can disagree. No different to anywhere else
[1:26:06] GFairyGaming: Canada is the same way, they make us figure it out and file it and then charge us if we get it wrong
[1:26:23] PicarusLoL: where do you find the mount speed addon I don‚Äôt see it on curse
[1:26:24] ShineyFighter: all i know is some stats in the US charge tax for having a roof~
[1:26:42] ShineyFighter: states*
[1:26:45] RAF_Sean: Appreciate you speaking to his majesty for us
[1:26:48] Haestoh: Maybe being employed isn't so bad mrgmAlright
[1:26:52] MachoCham: Probably not but you'd have more overheads
[1:26:56] Sasnak9: Tax companies just lobby for it, it is a whole industry since you basically have to have professional help or software to do taxes in the US
[1:26:57] RAF_Sean: Guaranteed you‚Äôd pay less. No NHS
[1:27:04] handovdoom666: you get more social programs in the UK than you would here
[1:27:07] Lausten: You wouldnt, but imagine the debt you would be in for your baby right now
[1:27:13] MediumRareOG: But you'd have to pay for health insurance
[1:27:19] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:27:24] RAF_Sean: It‚Äôs gotta be more than zero right?
[1:27:31] JakeSezz: I only get particular with my Navy-related purchases. Technically, since a haircut is required for military service, it‚Äôs tax-deductible, so I keep all my haircut receipts HahaThink
[1:27:32] MediumRareOG: Health insurance ballkpark in the US is going to be $1000/month+
[1:27:54] amricatt: It really is.
[1:27:56] Haestoh: Only 16 more years and you can use the baby as a 12,500 tax write off
[1:28:01] Arlaeya: US, depends on how much you want covered... and how sick you already are, yeah it can be 1 grand a month
[1:28:03] ShineyFighter: ^ id belive it.
[1:28:18] beezelebaub: I'm a single person and when I tried to get insurance late last year, it was $600/month for me D:
[1:28:21] beezelebaub: Here in the US*
[1:28:25] RAF_Sean: Yeah that sounds about right. I have a friend with 3 kids and he‚Äôs self employed and it‚Äôs like 1800/month in health insurance for hisbfamily
[1:28:28] WoWRoach: Retirement
[1:28:32] magemaster225: retirement investing
[1:28:32] MachoCham: Yikes monkaS
[1:28:34] MediumRareOG: $1000/month for a family of 3 is bare minimum and you won't get anything for that. You'll probably still have a $10k deductible
[1:28:34] physalis4: retirement
[1:28:35] RAF_Sean: RRSPs
[1:28:35] amricatt: I pay about $1000/month for only me.
[1:28:36] Puhg: Retirement account
[1:28:37] JakeSezz: Expat is when you‚Äôre a citizen of Country A but live & work in Country B
[1:28:48] physalis4: it's for people that don't have a traditional 401k
[1:29:00] MachoCham: Yeah fuck that. I'd be bankrupt
[1:29:12] wildfire9020: no
[1:29:14] Zuldak: in the US? some do
[1:29:17] Zuldak: not all
[1:29:24] handovdoom666: I pay $430 a month for health insurance for me and my spouse
[1:29:24] amricatt: No, you still have to pay it even with a company.  It's just cheaper.
[1:29:26] mctrouts: no. I‚Äôm employed but will pay 1600 a month just to have insurance.
[1:29:33] MediumRareOG: Some jobs give you health insurance. About 40-60 million Americans don't have health insurance
[1:29:39] Haestoh: US jobs pay a lot more than UK on average from what I heard. My friend was on 30K a year in UK and moved to US and got a job at 80K straight away.
[1:29:43] wildfire9020: health insurance in the states is a perk in some areas
[1:29:44] physalis4: depends on the plan
[1:29:48] amricatt: Yes, you are still paying even after paying insurance.
[1:29:49] mctrouts: still a co pay and deductible.
[1:29:51] Hayely: My health insurace is ‚Ç¨32 a week but 100% covered for everything, never any excess
[1:29:53] Arlaeya: hahah, yes you do! because they have doctors who can treat you who are outsourced!
[1:29:54] Zuldak: it depends on the plan and if its covered by the plan
[1:29:57] WoWRoach: They don't give it to you, they offer it to you and subsidize a portion.  But if you work at my company still 1200 a month
[1:30:01] physalis4: You have copays which are like $25 per visit
[1:30:06] Kyocere: most plans only cover so much and have yearly maximums. you still pay a ton
[1:30:08] JakeSezz: Not under unchained capitalism. Companies can choose to offer the shittiest imaginable plans to save money on their own bottom line
[1:30:14] MediumRareOG: You probably have a $10k deductible, meaning the first $10k per year they won't even cover
[1:30:18] miss_britbrit: THIS IS WHY I NEVER TRY TO GO TO A DOCTOR
[1:30:23] mctrouts: that‚Äôs what we do.
[1:30:25] adampanerabread: I had a thought about the netherwing scales. what if there's a new vendor at netherwing ledge in shadowmoon valley that's only active during the outland cup? dragonriding is usuable everywhere now..
[1:30:33] physalis4: Insurance get's you "discounted  rates" which are contracted rates the dr have with the insurance companies
[1:30:35] calphan84: you could always apply for government insurance
[1:30:36] Arlaeya: insurance exists to make insurance companies rich, not to help people get well.
[1:30:47] chefdejour82: or the dentist
[1:31:03] JakeSezz: @arlaeya üíØüíØüíØüíØ
[1:31:10] Haestoh: That fact people go bankrupt from having accidents or random long term illnesses is so fucking sad
[1:31:19] MachoCham: I mean I feel the pain; I had to pay ¬£9 for my prescription this month PepeHands
[1:31:22] miss_britbrit: exactly @Arlaeya
[1:31:30] MediumRareOG: The US is a dystopian hellscape of capitalism
[1:31:30] adampanerabread: they kept the insta post, but maybe didnt think to remove it
[1:31:40] Kyocere: with no insurance yeah, just give up lol
[1:31:51] Haestoh: @MachoCham countries gone to the dogs mate. Back in my day it was ¬£7
[1:31:56] chefdejour82: had to get a crown put on a molar cost $2500
[1:31:58] mctrouts: are dentist covered under the uk health plan?
[1:32:00] Arlaeya: they had to pass a law (one which may get disputed soon) to forbid hospitals from kicking out people with no insurance
[1:32:08] NIICKLAS_TV: yo yo hello
[1:32:15] MachoCham: It's subsidised though
[1:32:25] JakeSezz: I‚Äôm pretty fortunate, as Verizon has a great insurance plan and while not perfect, Tricare (military insurance) is still better than some of the other shitty plans out there
[1:32:34] Haestoh: You only get free dental as an unemployed or pregnant person
[1:32:39] NIICKLAS_TV: been shoveling snow for the last 30 minutes mrgmAlright
[1:32:47] RAF_Sean: Skydiving is fine. You‚Äôd never have to pay the bill from an accident there lol
[1:32:53] MachoCham: Dentures in the highest band will cost you ¬£300
[1:33:01] MediumRareOG: If you need healthcare, you go to Mexico or Canada
[1:33:04] Rexy95: god im glad i live in denmark with free healthcare :D
[1:33:13] GFairyGaming: They just enacted a thing here in Canada to provide dental care to children and the elderly
[1:33:21] Haestoh: @NIICKLAS_TV Exercise for the day done! mrgmDab

[1:33:41] Haestoh: Big Brain
[1:33:48] chefdejour82: daycare is really expensive too
[1:33:56] ShineyFighter: i do remember this video of a man running off an ambulance just to not pay the medicle bill after being hit by a car...
[1:34:04] chefdejour82: thats why my wife stays home to watch the kids
[1:34:42] DevoidX: you get child benefit payments too
[1:34:44] chefdejour82: it would cost $2000 a month for both kids in daycare
[1:35:13] NateOliveiras: If you're parents with low income in Brazil you can access public daycare which is free
[1:35:36] beezelebaub: ok, the eco-dome excursion race in netherstorm is 100% the worst
[1:35:45] REDSUNDERGROUND: i pay   about 2300 a month   for  childcare
[1:35:53] REDSUNDERGROUND: thats  2 kids
[1:35:57] GFairyGaming: Isn't there a technique where you can quickly look up and hit Skyward Ascent and the quickly look back down for a bigger boost than surge forward?
[1:36:01] beezelebaub: the bright lights of the domes make it hard to see the gates
[1:36:16] magemaster225: we used to get a monthly child credit but that was only with the COVID package, its over now
[1:36:20] NateOliveiras: @REDSUNDERGROUND this gotta be some kind of birth control

[1:38:55] Lausten: Its like driving, you're not looking straight down the road, you're looking ahead
[1:39:03] Zuldak: the trick is skyward ascent. you can angle the camera up and it will give you a boost that lasts longer than the surging forward
[1:39:14] Haestoh: Never done any of the dragon riding cups but just watching is stressing me out
[1:39:29] MachoCham: That assumes you've seen Dan drive
[1:39:33] RAF_Sean: I believe
[1:39:36] GFairyGaming: But I haven't done any of the harder versions of the races though
[1:39:36] Lausten: Havent you learned to do the dolphin yet?
[1:39:50] ShineyFighter: thats why hes dan the man.
[1:39:53] isillytoy: last two times I had to go to the hospital the bill for the ambulance was worse than the hospital bill
[1:40:19] LuiBMHunter: double it's value by filling it with  petrol?
[1:40:38] WoWRoach: I've had it in 3 cars and never had to pay  to activate it
[1:41:10] ShineyFighter: profit!
[1:41:13] Haestoh: @WoWRoach Same I've never heard of it needing paying for
[1:41:43] MachoCham: My head unit doesn't support it PepeHands

[1:42:00] ShineyFighter: love it when a plan comes together.

[1:44:05] MachoCham: Hbomber soyboy go give it a watch
[1:44:06] Krisjian: I just thought it was boring
[1:44:16] Arlaeya: "soy" is... emotions happened and they were uncomfortable with that.
[1:44:24] NeeK_23: its the people who call it "Wokecraft". I quite liked it though a little short for my tastes
[1:44:37] Haestoh: Soy Sauce is banging
[1:45:19] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:45:20] MediumRareOG: Anyone who unironically uses "soy" derogatively (like "woke" or "based") is 3 seconds away from a rant about trans people or vaccines
[1:45:42] maplelost: gilnea is the best story ive ever seen in my life
[1:45:43] databob1: Soy oil is literally in everything with flavor in it.. people with a soy allergy are cursed
[1:46:19] MachoCham: Not allowed
[1:46:30] ShineyFighter: maybe its an old itch?
[1:46:46] MediumRareOG: This isn't new. 10 years ago we had Gamergate
[1:46:54] Haestoh: Don't want no love and character development in my game about War.
[1:47:05] NeeK_23: I have not love for Nelf lore but seeing the end of the cut scene was genuinely touching imo
[1:47:06] ShineyFighter: imagen if wows story was like GOT~
[1:47:22] Arlaeya: they think constant warfare is "mature"
[1:47:25] chefdejour82: wow first kiss scene
[1:47:28] Zuldak: my only objection was 'Queen Calia' in the Gil reclaimation
[1:47:32] MachoCham: I enjoyed the Gilneas quest but I didn't read anything
[1:47:55] maplelost: malfurion goes on vacation and suddenly his return is a big deal
[1:48:24] NeeK_23: They think Varian was this super cool dude, when in fact he was a emotionally scarred guy with PTSD. They dont have the media literacy to see anything more than muscly man with swords
[1:48:27] Haestoh: @MachoCham this
[1:48:42] databob1: Gamer gate was two groups looking at the same problem from two points if view and fighting about it instead of trying to find common ground
[1:48:52] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:49:03] Prunusek: I'm hoping for Saurfang style cinematics to return in the War Within.
[1:49:05] MediumRareOG: There's a whole history to Gamergate but basically it resulted in female video game developers and journalists being harassed, doxed and given death threats, esssentially for being "woke" before "woke" was a thing
[1:49:10] NeeK_23: @maplelost he had a big sleep, sometimes we all need a nap
[1:49:25] maplelost: idk if i waited 10 years for Glineas reclaimation and thats how it went out id be pissed too
[1:49:30] Haestoh: I play wow to collect bigger number purple items, not to read and learn.
[1:49:34] Zuldak: yeah Midnight
[1:49:39] Implied_Slight: they're opening up more areas to additional content
[1:49:40] Nobbel87: considering how long people have been waiting to reclaim gilneas - calling it a 'means to an end'
[1:49:41] NeeK_23: and tbh Malfurion is very woke now after that nap LuL
[1:49:47] Nobbel87: why not make it an impactful event if you gonna do it, do it right
[1:50:16] MediumRareOG: But Gamergate had the same vibes that video games were being ruined (and somehow that justified doxing)
[1:50:26] Nobbel87: ow yeah its to clear the slate for next expansion
[1:50:38] Nobbel87: but the entire ending of dragonflight screams move out of the way, we gotta do something else
[1:50:42] Nobbel87: which is a shame
[1:51:06] Haestoh: I do find it really weird that in an expansion about Dragons they decided to shoehorn it in.
[1:51:08] NeeK_23: fresh slate was my take from it too, virtually all new leadership now
[1:51:16] chefdejour82: so im guessing next will be undercity
[1:51:31] Nobbel87: haaa grommash turning around, draenor is free
[1:51:32] Nobbel87: classic

[2:48:52] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:49:11] Shocklate_: Frick you Jimmy Madge
[2:50:33] databob1: Taliesin is hardly ever on half the time it feels like he doesn't want be there
[2:50:54] Saiyori: i believe
[2:50:58] Shocklate_: EZ
[2:51:06] MachoCham: Busy man
[2:51:17] databob1: Yeah
[2:51:28] Saiyori: He's had a lot of trolls in chat and I'm sure it's exhausting
[2:51:28] magemaster225: hes been streaming youtube but not co streaming it to twitch for his podcast thing
[2:51:35] Haestoh: Kids man, everyone has kids, they be busy
[2:51:36] NeeK_23: they were away in America over christmas so he only just back
[2:52:25] Shocklate_: Ive gotten a few thousand views on the videos ive made man, feels good
[2:52:45] databob1: His chat problems are his own fault he let's people goad him to much
[2:52:58] Shocklate_: 100%
[2:53:45] TyndiVelspaz: glad he did that! Its good to have a support system when things get rough
[2:54:28] Haestoh: I have massive amount of respect for people who make content. I've been trying to put a video together for a couple of weeks now and from planning, editing and recording takes so much time.
[2:54:38] MediumRareOG: that's more of a hug box than a circle jerk
[2:54:39] NeeK_23: I had one video hit 1400 views and it was a great feeling, the next got 34 views. Kinda demoralising
[2:54:53] JakeSezz: I dunno, maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not a primary revenue stream and I‚Äôm small-time, but I get more frustrated with StreamLabs than I do with any number of viewers or how I feel a stream went. I just like to hangout lmao
[2:55:02] Shocklate_: oh I will message adam and have him critique my stuff and he will tell me when something isnt working
[2:55:36] TheHunter90: are these races harder then the rest?

[2:56:39] physalis4: I gave up trying to make videos. I just don't have the time. I'd rather focus on the parts I enjoy about content creation than stress myself out
[2:56:50] dastago: how do you feel about the gilneas questline? as a worgen main for 10+ years it felt very short and weird the racial leader isn't even a worgen now
[2:56:52] JakeSezz: Chat can be running, along with my video and everything else, but StreamLabs locks up and video freezes on my end and I can‚Äôt swap between scenes
[2:56:53] Haestoh: I hate listening back to myself. I judge my speech in a recording way too much.
[2:57:22] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:58:19] Haestoh: I did watch a bunch of videos on Audacity last night and finally got settings and recording method perfect so I'm happy with the quality now.

[2:59:02] NeeK_23: Im more of a behind the scenes guy than the "face" of content, so I'm more focusing on assisting others these days
[3:01:00] dastago: dastago subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 3 month streak! mrgmDance
[3:01:06] databob1: I mean taliesin is a trained actor so I guess it makes sense that he's acting i
[3:01:28] MediumRareOG: Campaign quests don't show on the map when you hit level 70. It's very weird and very annoying (and not new)
[3:01:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: There are two places to get the quest seed.  One in the Valdrexxen portal to SW area and then I was pleasantly surrpised to see that the same guy is hanging out by the Trade District Warboard.
[3:01:42] NeeK_23: I will say alot of the "stay & while" dialogue scenes arent signposted at all and easily missed. If Devs want story to be the forefront, then they need to make it visible to the players better
[3:01:49] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I'm just waiting for the kid
[3:02:06] databob1: Sorry I'm running at the mouth
[3:02:42] Grzmocillla: bc this race sucks
[3:02:58] MediumRareOG: Did it have the normal quest marker or the campaign quest marker over the NPC? I haven't done it
[3:03:08] Grzmocillla: its long and unfun no speed at all
[3:03:39] databob1: I'm not running the race but it looks fun..my opinion may change when I run it
[3:05:20] viowel: this one is the worst
[3:06:41] snagprophet: KEKW
[3:06:41] NeeK_23: i even hold W even though it doesnt do anything
[3:06:49] dastago: never noticed i do that but yes absolutely
[3:06:51] MediumRareOG: I would've rage quit by now
[3:07:00] databob1: That's what she said
[3:07:09] Orzorg: The reverse is even more annoying on this race

[3:07:47] Iwony: I usually try to do it on weekends as I am far fresher in the head for these and yes I usually get hurting hand from handling the mouse for the races
[3:07:57] physalis4: I love goooooolllld
[3:08:14] amricatt: I wish we didn't see other players during the race.  It's distracting.
[3:08:20] Grzmocillla: haha
[3:08:23] khalcrux_gaming: Will there be new sparks for season 4?
[3:08:32] Grzmocillla: im 1000% sure its bc a LAGS
[3:08:37] viowel: my best one was 87.900
[3:08:54] viowel: i just cant cant do it LUL
[3:09:03] Grzmocillla: few times i was 100% sure i will be gold and i was 20 sec behind bc my server is alggy as fuck
[3:09:11] sysimus: Those races should show yourearlier best run as "ghost" running at same time. Could easily compare how well you are doing.
[3:09:19] MediumRareOG: we know everything about season 4. Just keep doing what you did in season 3 for the same gear at a slightly higher ilvl :)
[3:09:23] LuiBMHunter: If at first you don't succeed - give up!
[3:11:22] viowel: the revers one is easier
[3:11:44] funviking99: LUL
[3:11:44] BBMezzy: I did not realise they had added new herb/mining indicators on the minimap for special nodes :O
[3:11:59] viowel: i did it 2nd try but 10 + for the advanced LUL
[3:12:07] MachoCham: Bronze

[3:16:29] physalis4: Which is the hardest so far?
[3:17:05] Big_Rum: Thats what she said
[3:17:30] CloudyHS: you use two surge forwards at the start, you can get away with 1 and do a skyward ascent on the 2nd
[3:17:43] xyandriia: i forgot the outland cup came out today!! something to look forward to after work
[3:17:56] CloudyHS: no i know i mean thats what you r doing, like

[3:19:22] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:19:45] CloudyHS: if you move your direction too much during skyward ascent you can clip the 2nd wing flap and u lose speed, so try to stay steady when using it youll get more time on the speed boost
[3:20:16] CloudyHS: Pog
