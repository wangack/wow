[2:09:40] TheMunchy: docPls
[2:09:48] Warothwar: back in the days fkign Twitch was sometimes so laggy, the follow button would load and then you were tricked into thinking that you accidently defollowed and then you click the follow button and nothign happens and suddenly you defollowed, I rememebr thats why Savix is not followed that long anymore to Claaks channel for instance
[2:09:50] Xanth1501: @arksyde1 I believe it's Ability Team Tracker, it's been a while since I heard him mention the name though
[2:09:58] MaMad666: @elldiayy FYI, the upgrade would be to upgrade the PVE stats of the PVP gear. There is no need to upgrade for PVP
[2:10:11] doomiro: is this live with 40% stamina increase?
