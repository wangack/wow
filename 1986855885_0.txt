[1:51:58] mavericks312: cata was better then wrath but yall not ready for that atlk
[1:51:59] Noshpan: Not getting that option, since there was never an option to stay TBC when they released WotLK
[1:52:22] Molvonos: #Aug4life
[1:52:42] Nutqase: cata was reason many quit
[1:52:45] tylerwithghosts: Corbin basically won me my fantasy league so im tempted lmao
[1:53:02] mavericks312: @Nutqase numbers say your wrong try again
[1:53:12] Molvonos: Headcanon v. Facts are two entirely different things.
[1:53:13] c0mmander_starscream: Real talk
[1:53:18] pry_mal: I walked during cata...came back mid-late panda
[1:53:18] Skizzurp: i started playing in cata lol
[1:53:21] cynical_effect12: When does Cata Classic release again
[1:53:22] Noshpan: We can all agree that WoD was worst expac
[1:53:35] Nutqase: @mavericks312 but did they have same numbers as wotlk ?
[1:53:48] Submarine_Mike: I played from Vanilla up to Pandaria then quit
[1:53:53] Aidler: I came back because of LFR. the prospect to be able to experience raids for the first time was the reason for me
[1:53:54] mavericks312: @Nutqase yes they basically sustained the same numbers
[1:53:57] c0mmander_starscream: I thought Draenor was everyone stopped playing
[1:54:02] maccaruso: Depends on what you call a decline.  The peak numbers were in WotLK.
[1:54:02] c0mmander_starscream: thats when I left
[1:54:07] Nutqase: @Towelliee didn' cata lose numbers compared to wotlk ?
[1:54:08] Densetsu_: WoD > rest
[1:54:13] Molvonos: @Nutqase No.

[1:54:33] Daveybutter: Wrath > All
[1:54:35] Molvonos: WotLK is not some golden child of WoW expansions.
[1:54:46] tlsmith3638: shhhhhh you cant tell younins that facts matter they get sad
[1:54:47] Bowwjack: @Towelliee Dreanor wasn't even that bad either the problem with Dreanor was that it had a trash launch and the content kinda got a little stale at times
[1:54:47] Molvonos: Arthas Dickriders can't get over it
[1:54:53] Nutqase: @Molvonos whasen't wotlk a very succeful expansion for blizzard tho ?
[1:54:56] mavericks312: wrath is WoWs most overated xpac
[1:54:57] Colt_Engineer: Legion best xpac
[1:55:06] CGamer76: I dont know why ppl hated on WoD but I loved the raids and dungeons in it
[1:55:08] kokochris: MOP was great
[1:55:12] honeybadger1113: if ppl werent so afraid of change they would see the only realy bad expansion was wod simple as that
[1:55:15] breadwilton: i dont blame them
[1:55:20] breadwilton: nobody wanted pandas
[1:55:24] Molvonos: @Nutqase What the does that have to do with anything?  It did well,  Did it do better than Cata?  No.
[1:55:27] Aidler: and MOP is still my favorite expansion besides Legion
[1:55:37] azzurrin: @Colt_Engineer I agree!
[1:55:47] N3llee: didnt like mop
[1:55:53] N3llee: raids were solid
[1:56:00] notColt45: MoP was soo good. I wanted Pandas from WC3
[1:56:03] tylerwithghosts: wrath is where i became a proper main tank for my guild at the time so it holds a special spot in my heart for that reason alone
[1:56:12] N3llee: but dailys and cloak req was complete bullshit
[1:56:24] Densetsu_: Arthas is one of, if not the,   most interesting and well made character in Warcraft. Kreygasm
[1:56:49] Molvonos: https://www.wowhead.com/item=10503/rose-colored-goggles
[1:57:03] mavericks312: arthas is the most boring and overated character
[1:57:04] honeybadger1113: lol
[1:57:08] Nutqase: i think atleast blizzard should add hardcore bc and wotlk could be fun
[1:57:11] CGamer76: I started pally tanking in TBC b/c that's where it actually became a viable tank spec
[1:57:39] ChosenRonin: @Towelliee mist is when i took a break then came back at legion i just didnt like the new system cuz wraith was the apex for me more the story didnt grip me i think
[1:58:03] mavericks312: no way my favorite character can only be owrth 35 anima
[1:58:08] Molvonos: Ambio should have that, lol
[1:58:16] Colt_Engineer: why interupt when I can parse
[1:58:18] Aidler: @Densetsu_ probably correct but for me personally that still didn't put wotlk a S tier expansion
[1:58:29] Aidler: *made
[1:58:47] notColt45: I think that made it the most played though
[1:59:24] Nutqase: @Aidler who was the highest expansion foryou
[1:59:26] Nutqase: '?
[1:59:30] Nutqase: *which
[1:59:58] Badd_Boi: same
[2:00:06] notColt45: I hope its successful
[2:00:06] mavericks312: soda was telling peeps if there not 60 yet do not touch SoD

[2:00:30] tofuwizard: Locks are the greatest class imo
[2:00:32] notColt45: or just no pally
[2:00:35] Densetsu_: @Aidler Well just speaking from a lore and character perspective, from WC3 and TFT. Its OK if people didnt like WotLK zekeYUP
[2:01:12] Nutqase: @Aidler both those was very good expansion
[2:01:23] Bowjangels: never played DH. what is the bottom green bar you have 2 charges of?

[2:47:26] Bowwjack: @Towelliee I have a 15 Waycrest on my hunter if you want it
[2:47:29] tawney_owl_: im average 15-17 on all dungeons except dawn of infinites lol
[2:47:31] ambiotic: its just entangling on all the bosses that require you to be in position
[2:47:38] ambiotic: its stupid
[2:47:39] Veegore: i have 21's or 20's all times in every other dungeon except DOTI dungeons

[2:48:08] Mr_Pennywise_: i just wish the ads where like a banner at the bottom of the stream and did not interfere with the stream but then i think twitch would not get as many ad company's used them so they wont do that :(
[2:48:20] ashwing_: 19.2 with 1 min 30 till enrage KEKW
[2:48:23] fondersdoor: whats liquids best %
[2:48:29] assuran123: Also, we have no actual idea of where Liquid is since they turned off stream
[2:48:29] Skizzurp: and last phase has so many mechs that basically wipe you if u mess up

[2:48:52] Allexi88: Enrage is having no seeds left I think
[2:48:58] tawney_owl_: @Mr_Pennywise_ yeah youtube has like 6 ads per 5 minute video now so seems like corps can do whatever tf they want lol
[2:48:59] Novirtue_: That looks not fun LUL
[2:49:00] ashwing_: Yep even casters said it
[2:49:01] tylerwithghosts: I have an 18 Atal'Dazar if you're interested @Towelliee
[2:49:04] Allexi88: Also liquid went dark at 36%
[2:49:06] Veegore: liquid went dark last night, so we'll see what their % is when they log in
[2:49:08] Noiseeater: it s on warcraft logs
[2:49:11] Noiseeater: 36.4%
[2:49:11] fondersdoor: liquid went dark for a  bit i think
[2:49:13] mavericks312: there arent new logs from when they went dark yet
[2:49:14] Allexi88: They will be starting around 10am PST
[2:49:31] Thoreya: liquid went offline for like 5 hours last night and did private logs
[2:49:35] brewgamingtv: i wouldn't be shocked if they are right around the same time as echo
[2:49:36] GameWithDerp: can you hide from /who? because they weren't on last night nor this morning
[2:49:46] ashwing_: No chance. They said they are moving pots around but dont think that will do it
[2:49:47] Athaeln: They will have bl now I think
[2:49:47] Veegore: enrage timer is just to get to the mythic phase, then the time resets kekw
[2:50:11] Novirtue_: What they meant is that they wanted a "1 Month race" LUL

[2:50:34] assuran123: We don't know.  They went dark around 3 hours before the end of the night
[2:50:44] Allexi88: Echo also did alot of strategizing off stream
[2:50:47] ambiotic: they were on til at least 1am pst
[2:50:48] GameWithDerp: can you hide from ingame /who?
[2:50:51] honeybadger1113: tbh i just wanna see this legendary in game lol
[2:50:52] doomester: are fyrak even tooned to be killed at this IL they got now? @Towelliee
[2:51:01] NYKO7_: two hand axe users just waiting for them to kill it so they can finally see their early christmas present LUL
[2:51:01] stridro: now its a wipe
[2:51:18] tawney_owl_: long ass cbt end fights are the bread and butter of the race tho lol
[2:51:22] Molvonos: "We're not gonna race against the top guilds."
[2:51:24] tawney_owl_: thats what people come there for
[2:51:30] infektyd: @NYKO7_ right? they need to stop slacking
[2:51:31] honeybadger1113: @NYKO7_ for real lol
[2:51:35] wazon_7: i would much rather see earlier bosses being harder instead of 6 bosses being a dummy target for these guilds and last 2 taking a week to clear
[2:51:39] mavericks312: there either going over there strat atm or watching how echo is progging
[2:51:42] hoochymamma: @Towelliee Do this players keep playing the game after they are done with the race ?
[2:51:48] dawnovun: They play on PTR thats why lol, infinte reagents/pots/flasks
[2:51:49] joemammyyy: I really like the fight anesthetics though, I think the raid is cool to play in
[2:51:56] ambiotic: smolderon took them a bit
[2:51:59] Bowwjack: @Towelliee i think there is a difference between a fight beig 10 minutes + long and having 4 minutes of RP vs a fight being 10 minutes long and consistently go go go and ramping up more and more as the fight progresses
[2:52:02] stridro: yes
[2:52:09] Dragunstorm15: I remember max saying before they went dark, they were talking about strategies that they didn’t want to show yet
[2:52:19] Mr_Pennywise_: anyone else here from the UK ? if so DAM COLD ant it lol
[2:52:26] Pharaoh_326: do we know the stats of the weapon?
[2:52:39] tawney_owl_: welp i flew into zaralek now im stuck in a death loop inside of a wall
[2:52:40] wazon_7: probably watching echos stream and strategizing
[2:52:43] Allexi88: They'll be starting around 10am PST
[2:52:44] tawney_owl_: preem
[2:52:44] jkitchin75: does the axe drop on lfr?
[2:52:47] GameWithDerp: yea, they weren't on last night either -- my guess is they are not coming in with some super low %
[2:52:50] bigcountry555: its scripted
[2:52:52] bigcountry555: prerecorded
[2:52:58] EpicWookiee: What are the chase cards people are looking for in the blizzard legacy collection?

[4:04:25] valianya: @towelliee any opinion on the new version of the Twitch for TV app?  It removes built-in chat functionality and is unresponsive to buttons.

[4:19:34] SaiyanGodX_Ano: josh fuck up method
[4:19:37] Kinghorn: fucking josh

[4:20:17] yadungoofed101: I mean honestly, I think a lot of the players were ready to dip on method anyway
[4:20:21] Etherdon: Geez that dps is melee heavy.
[4:20:23] mavericks312: method needs to prove they can win on there own an not need others strats
[4:20:33] SaiyanGodX_Ano: yep
[4:20:49] Brodih_: if Method had kicked him before the drama surfaced, i wonder if they would have survived
[4:20:56] Kinghorn: they just had to go dark for a bit
[4:21:04] Phil87z: if echo folds method poaches then and rises up
[4:21:41] atsq1: everbloom second boss is terrible this week
[4:21:41] LilSkraps: @Towelliee WAIT NO WAY, you were the DH i was talking last night
[4:21:44] trivotix: If Method starts payin an obscene amount, their players will come back
[4:21:50] Snabido: Hey guys, 'member me? ye haHAA
[4:21:50] Tjoertell: That's entirely what I expect, some have already gone back.
[4:21:58] yadungoofed101: kinda how it goes though; there is only a small player pool for the 0.1% wf raiders
[4:22:04] Templexx: yoooo
[4:22:18] valianya: Business wise, do you think Echo is operating at a loss?  Even if they don't win, they're and Method are really the only competition to Liquid and that generates money even if they don't win most of the time.  They still can win, and that generates business hype, following, and so money.
[4:22:22] Mr_Pennywise_: BOOP

[4:23:12] SaiyanGodX_Ano: if they where able to do split like echo and liquid they will already done the race xD
[4:23:32] yadungoofed101: @Templexx skyline is known for high pull counts; kinda how taiwan guilds operate
[4:23:40] Phil87z: that why Blizz has slowly phased out all of their esports efforts. it’s not worth it
[4:23:42] mikael_jansson90: @dawnovun and your point is?
[4:23:48] Collected1: should blizzard prevent splits from being a thing?

[4:25:37] Exxcar: @Towelliee Max claiming they had a 16% NO LUST pull last night
[4:25:56] yadungoofed101: no he didnt he said 27
[4:25:58] Thralazaar: that's how you stay in a good position, standing on business
[4:26:01] yadungoofed101: with a couple dead

[4:26:40] ARX_MT: what’s the addon that shows you the classes when you search for a dungeon ?
[4:26:47] Tjoertell: Max said they had a 27% pull last night that was scuff, his claim was that if they get a clean pull into p3 it'll hit 10%.
[4:26:57] pretty_neat_bob: blizzard has trading cards ?
[4:26:59] cazhually: @towelliee is liquid winning

[4:28:14] Strifelol: Do they have a Warglaives card?
[4:28:14] yadungoofed101: @valianya doubtful, tagz talked about it on liquid interview the other night. It's boring content and it would also reveal their strat making method
[4:28:17] Strifelol: That would be sick
[4:28:18] Phoxzy: Its a endorphin rush similar to gambling

If they wanted to release the kill video they'd not have strategy discussions on it.  That's common sense if they want to protect their process.

At 70, do the Dreamsurge, Time Rifts, Superbloom events to gear up to get into LFR and raids.  Heroic, mythic 0, m+, and time walking dungeons all count towards Vault too.

[6:22:51] Bowwjack: @Towelliee omg i am gonna unsub because my reset happens while i am sleeping on Wednesday or Tuesday
[6:23:01] devilhawk83: won’t say next hour, but maybe in the next 4-6 hours Fyrakk may go down but it depends on whether they (as in Liquid and Echo) think they can beat him within the enrage timer and probably 10-15 seconds into the enrage timer if the tanks got any CD ready
[6:23:03] DunzoCD: @NineThree sloot retired after abberus
[6:23:13] N3llee: echo chat is nuts.. I said one thing about this same scenario happened at the end of shadowlands in favor of echo and got 50 dm's asking why I am rooting for Liquid.
