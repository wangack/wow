[4:43:16] Shimorta: @norkibit have way less mob control with bear than ppal/vdh
[4:43:56] Relynia: How do learn to tank? It seems so stressful as you'll get flamed if you suck.
[4:44:16] kitty0chi: learn from the flaming?
[4:44:33] buoylouis: @Relynia do lower keys to learn pulls and every mechanic the mobs and bosses do
[4:44:56] ceookz: @Relynia watch ur spec tank in twitch and learn from them then pump the lfg
[4:45:19] Grillyo: @Relynia you smile as you leave the group knowing you get into the next one whenever you want to
[4:45:21] TheSweeneyGG: Find a few guildies to tank with. Also some really cool communities too
[4:45:24] JBugaboo: do it, suck, do it some more, suck some more, get flamed for sucking, then learn and get good
[4:45:43] Relynia: I've been playing up to 20s as Ret Paladin for that specific reason.
[4:45:43] stryftek: what spec is DH running? orb, no orb?
[4:48:32] Relynia: I use to tank and heal only but I stopped playing in Cata till this season. Just so much I needed to learn about the game again.
[4:48:36] buoylouis: what kind of people would u say tanking is for? im a tank so im just curious lol
[4:49:09] discomancer1: control freaks
[4:49:10] Grillyo: @buoylouis impatient twats with a need for control and an overwhelming desire to have everything in the candystore
[4:50:00] buoylouis: that's a bold assumption to make about a human being based on the role they like to play in world of warcraft
[4:50:13] Grasshoppa117: feel like my dh tanking is decent my damage is pretty low though
[4:50:15] mystchh: you just literally asked for it
[4:50:30] Grasshoppa117: usually end on like 75k overall between 15-18 keys :(
[4:50:56] fistofnature: @Grasshoppa117 youre either playing with really good dps or your pulls are too small
[4:51:02] buoylouis: @mystchh i figured there would be a mix of positives and negatives not just flame cuz that's not a sincere answer
[4:51:20] Grasshoppa117: ok thought maybe im not using orb enough

[4:52:12] fistofnature: @Grasshoppa117 oh yeah, using your abilities more often is also important. Try to look at your dmg profile and look at what other people use. If you have a dps spec or an alt, see what other DH tanks use and try to learn that way
[4:52:21] buoylouis: and i was also asking dorki. not u ppl

[4:55:15] xxjameskingxx71: dorki trolling again?
[4:55:28] yctnm: driney had the foresight
[4:56:17] Grillyo: @fistofnature yes but its better than the 12 step process of baiting them into saying a naughty word so they actually get banned. And tbf, you can also just turn off chat. It's not ideal. But that's the tools you got.
[4:56:42] flockheart: mods taking out first time chatters monkaH

[5:09:12] spannker_: @dorki do u think WW monk coulda fit on a comp like that instead of pally ret?
[5:09:24] alfu6aim: what do you think of survival hunter
[5:09:26] spannker_: or pally ret is just too boosted and WW is too shit?
[5:09:54] asianmeep25: whats the weakaura that shows spell icons when you are targetted? couldnt find it in your wago page
[5:10:01] reedsworld: think mdi will be diverse in comps?
