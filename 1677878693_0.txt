[1:44:17] Torjix: Lost ark Una task system

[1:44:18] Siddydiddydo: yeah just normal playing will get you that too
[1:44:19] elvance08: old naxx sets will be there you think? :O
[1:44:19] gotdatpiff420: is that 500 per character or 500 per account
[1:44:20] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @AlmightyAtlas (warning)
[1:44:21] PokerFaceMoose: they said you get 500 from the travelers log so you only need to do 10
[1:44:25] mmo_kenna_: it's the same as ESO endeavour system
[1:44:28] Iolgz: bringing wow up to 2022, nice. big W

[1:44:48] Cacos: @gotdatpiff420 its account wide, so it's per account
[1:44:53] imSev7: As long as they dont try to sneak in a premium pass it's a W
[1:44:55] AlmightyAtlas: A battle pass that doesn't involve any real money currency.
[1:44:59] perssonsz: How about a archaeology section

[1:45:04] SilkeySmooth: so buy the expansion pay he monthly fee then pay for in game contne?...lol
[1:45:18] Moobot: Calm the spam, @afgooey (warning)
[1:45:21] luckfore: wow finally catching up with drops and battlepass @Towelliee
[1:45:26] imSev7: @SilkeySmooth it's not a paid feature
[1:45:27] Roxamos: the key take away is it seems like a FAIR battlepass @Towelliee
[1:45:28] GenAlder: seems like achievements 2.0 also
[1:45:28] ispyyro: Blizzard are doing too many good things lately. Should we be worried?
[1:45:33] Arch0ntas777: @Towelliee did you read that people now compaining because there are too many things they can do?   previously they were complaining that there aren't too much to do....
[1:45:35] TheMattOwen: Is this not just a battlepass?
[1:45:36] Fintim0m: if it cost money just a big no
[1:45:37] afgooey: not sure hwo that happened
[1:45:42] Iolgz: they can't afford to not keep up with the features of modern games like overarch and Fortnite etc. it's great
[1:45:42] Alepouditsa: ohh raid's danCry

[1:47:59] Densetsu_: Towelliee, do you have any gut feeling how long the first raid will last? You think there will be a "mini-raid" inbetween?
[1:48:00] afgooey: never tried a raid or nothing

[1:49:34] afgooey: im offended by not knowing whats happening
[1:49:37] Auru: i mean after 2 week liquid tend to run into roster issues
[1:49:37] reiidarr: #tankgate

[1:49:43] perssonsz: Oh yeah in how many hours does it begin sir ? I’m in eu so I don’t know when Na resets @towelliee

[1:50:48] Rottencoarse: @NickLeonhearth  in 4 hours
[1:51:00] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think the race is gonna stretch to 2 weeks, so I think liquid has this tier.
[1:51:04] afgooey: quit highlighting me
[1:51:05] Fortvila: @Towelliee How do you have such high renown ?
[1:51:08] afgooey: i did not consent
[1:51:09] Rottencoarse: server reset has not even happened at US yet
[1:51:11] tigerkitty92: One thing I look at it is the tanks and how they lead the team through the riad
[1:51:18] odtee: @XGC_Malevolence in Destiny 2 the season last for 3 months and I still dont hit the level 100 in their season pass in recent times. stopped caring bout it all eventually which might backfire for blizz too
[1:51:23] auckz: does anyone know if I still can get the ichabod pet?
[1:51:28] perssonsz: Oh yes definitely
[1:51:30] Drizz_36: i love that the raid is shorter, i think the first raid of an expansion should be a bit on the easier side

[1:51:44] afgooey: what state do u live in
[1:51:46] MortiousPrime: Lots of tech companies do that
[1:51:47] FleetAdmiralSalacnar: That gap between EU and US means basically that US is still beta testing the raid till the raid goes live on EU side
[1:51:49] tigerkitty92: True
[1:51:51] MortiousPrime: Yeah, they have an on-call staff
[1:52:05] firehawk73: @Towelliee do you think we will know the big baddie of this expac by the end of the race?
[1:52:05] Dirt3y: facts
[1:52:05] odtee: whats the best place to keep track of the progress in a table format?
[1:52:08] MortiousPrime: MortiousPrime subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Gotta get back at this

[1:52:57] Pilek01: Murozond or Galakrond
[1:53:04] afgooey: maybe hufflepuff
[1:53:06] draken4o: 4 primal elemental raids.. gonnaget boring
[1:53:07] Glabaa: galakrond shivers
[1:53:07] ArcaneSyntax: some old god stuff maybe
[1:53:09] MortiousPrime: The return of Galakrond would be pretty neat
[1:53:09] auckz: can I still get the sub gift pet?
[1:53:13] medadeath: dont think deathwing is dead
[1:53:15] Siddydiddydo: I wonder if we'll get the santctum raids 2.0
[1:53:17] zeeAbe: One of the primalists will be DADDY PRIMALIST, that will be the 2nd tier raid boss and then MUROZONDORMU will be the last boss for 3rd raid
[1:53:19] kalamari__: fira nd ice dragon could be one raid
[1:53:23] Todmeister9000: Galakrond is long dead tho
[1:53:24] FleetAdmiralSalacnar: Or maybe some Void stuff
[1:53:27] afgooey: hufflepuff gonna shift the whole game, gonna have to rearrange ur whole raiding team
[1:53:30] Calphurnious: Has WoW ever done a full map meta event like in GW2?
[1:53:33] Moskeebee: any word on the world boss location? or ilvl lewt that drops?
[1:53:39] XGC_Malevolence: The destiny 2 battle pass has weeks of challenges needed to be completed. Its also easy to catch up in since you can do all the challenges at once later on. They make it east to complete but you still have to play the game. Not every item is meant to be collected by every person. Perceived fomo is not actual fomo
[1:53:40] afgooey: hufflepuff goes straight for the squishies
[1:53:42] MortiousPrime: @kalamari__ Let's not copy GW2 TOO much
[1:53:44] afgooey: x2 damage to tanks
[1:53:45] MysticRaven_: if there is people who can make a old god in BFA then there is people who can ressurect Galakrond
[1:53:49] Heiryoku: Where can I buy pvp trinkets ?
[1:53:49] deekayed: mindess beast

[2:46:20] figurines: Why don't they just delay opening the raid for NA until EU drops, but still give us the rest of the patch. Is it that hard?
[2:46:21] AngryRedPanda40: Can some please explain the purpose of weak auras I am very confused what it truly does.

[2:49:07] Featherbow: @Drunkenvalley yes. if it's not there, then you didn't gift two subs. you also can't do it anonymously
[2:49:10] Aldria_: @iblighters Well - that seemed more like a IRL thing. He was moving to the UK and didn't really give his best on the retrials for echo. According to himself atleast
[2:49:23] XGC_Malevolence: How many combat rogues do you think will be on the winning team? 4+? @towelliee

[4:53:12] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so Where do i watch Race to the World First.. what channels
[4:53:17] arthalie: @towelliee do you think we could see a world first upset with a lower tier guild that skips and goes straight to mythic?

[4:55:24] fynnswow: battle passes are bad
[4:55:27] 1Om3ga: @Towelliee Happy to see the channel is doing great!!
[4:55:32] xo_navi: LUL
[4:55:33] Sonatta: Renown is basically a battle pass
[4:55:35] MysticalOS: it depends how you said it, people usually tie battle pass with pay to win
[4:55:39] smokingcactus: @BearOnWallStreet Blizz sometimes limits fps in major cities. has been a thing for along time
[4:55:40] D4v1d7w17ch: more content for the game is always a win.
[4:55:41] xo_navi: It's not a paid battle pass it's just login rewards
[4:55:41] Holysal: @ThatUnfluffyPanda how are they bad?
[4:55:42] Atraxt: It's because you said "Battle Pass" that's why
[4:55:43] fynnswow: if you explained it like a battle pass for me that'd = instant dislike lol
[4:55:43] scramperlive: Trading post feels like Wonderous Tales from FFXIV
[4:55:44] TheRiwen: @ThatUnfluffyPanda Yes they  are
[4:55:45] MysticalOS: calling it a battle pass is just bad
[4:55:45] abracka_: it's nice to see, ESO has a similar system with the endeavor tokens/coins
[4:55:45] Volmancer: It is a gated unlock system for cosmetics
[4:55:46] Drizz_36: it's a free battle pass
[4:55:47] TuRDz__: servers are back up...? how is towlie on lol
[4:55:49] xo_navi: Wildstar and FFXIV have similar systems
[4:55:49] Tainted_Meats: free and optional
[4:55:52] LX2_EXE: It's just a reason to keep people subbed
[4:55:52] Revoca: @ThatUnfluffyPanda then dont do it...

[4:55:54] BennyG57: its basically the Treasure Trove system in FFXIV
[4:55:55] dranet11: @ThatUnfluffyPanda they aren't inherently bad you 🤡
[4:55:56] Todmeister9000: battle passes are not bad LUL
[4:55:56] Dannyboy4477: if it costs it sucks if it is free it is awesome
[4:55:56] gritbarontv: it required no extra money, so it's not an actual battle pass
[4:55:58] skratchh: D4 going to have a battlepass YUCk
[4:55:58] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @1Om3ga (warning)
[4:55:59] Dwarfi: we pay the sub
[4:56:00] Raafuh: It’s seems drastically different from a battle pass
[4:56:05] REDSUNDERGROUND: WE PAY FOR IT WITYH OUR SANITY

[4:56:07] pereadin: It’s a battle play KEKW
[4:56:10] ItsTrevway: only battle passes you have to pay for are bad *cough *diablo *cough*
[4:56:11] heftyhanktv: Elaborate on this trading post you speak of good sir!
[4:56:12] tannerazm: Not paying for it... yet. Or do you think it will ever be paid?
[4:56:13] Tainted_Meats: like a pass. you have to do things for currencies
[4:56:14] Nightjester31: Usually battle passes have a free and paid track
[4:56:17] pereadin: Play cause you ain’t paying for these rewards homie
[4:56:21] Nuggnuts: "ER MA GERD How is Towelliee playing"
[4:56:25] AjjtheDK: cosmetic "battle passes" are 100% fine its just another grind.
[4:56:26] firewalltwitch: D4 having a battle pass is the worst thing ever
[4:56:28] Drizz_36: you fill a bar by doing shit in game.
[4:56:29] Ultratide_: yea servers are back up and he decided to lvl a paladin instead of raiding or m+, chatters stop being dumb
[4:56:29] xo_navi: It's just free login rewards. The moment you have to pay for it is when it's bad.
[4:56:32] Tainted_Meats: play pass.
[4:56:33] Revoca: its literally a free battle pass....
[4:56:36] 1Om3ga: Wow, just trying to give the man cuddos
[4:56:37] Nightjester31: So they just give us a free track only which is fine
[4:56:38] Aubue: do activity for currency
[4:56:41] mmo_kenna: @belfastcl i agree with this
[4:56:43] capricore: BATTLEPASS?!? REEEEEEEEEEE
[4:56:43] litreofcola187: litreofcola187 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:56:44] ItsTrevway: @firewalltwitch yup
[4:56:44] Eziak: Battle passes don’t have rewards a that return. If you don’t get the reward you never have a chance at it again.
[4:56:44] papascruge: @Rejekrigeren estimate on launcher is in 3 hours but who knows
[4:56:47] DynkLive: like an xp bar lol
[4:56:48] Bubblexx: they might as well put clash of clans in the wow by now Kappa
[4:56:49] Raafuh: Yeah I guess I meant more in the sense of having to pay for it sense it FREE
[4:56:49] heftyhanktv: are we talking about the hunts or?
[4:56:49] ChiefBeard: the League of legends Winter Pass right now.
[4:56:49] Tubflow: implementin g battle pass before going free to play
[4:56:50] iDystinct: battle passes are usually paid and uncapped.
[4:56:50] maltore_: "free"
[4:56:51] cassetto: is wow NA down?
[4:56:52] BearOnWallStreet: @nuggnuts tbf a lot of ppl just don’t know lol
[4:56:54] bulldogge25: FREE WITH SUB
[4:56:54] akawaiidab: Looks great to be honest. Always wanted a way to get more things!
[4:56:55] Holysal: I like battlepasses
[4:56:56] Fragssgaming: How long till raids are out???? @towelliee
[4:56:57] mrrazputin: I spend 318h watching Towelliee these year :D
[4:57:00] Umoran: free for how long , that is the question
[4:57:01] segarth: you technically have to pay for the subscription Kappa
[4:57:01] Tainted_Meats: yep. blizz doing good work so far.
[4:57:03] Raafuh: I think it’ll be cool.
[4:57:03] Drizz_36: free stuff = bad, apparently
[4:57:03] Todmeister9000: ppl associate battle pass with paying
[4:57:04] Arch0ntas777: imagine if they add login rewards too
[4:57:05] itsZiz: For now
[4:57:05] Baron_Pandacula: I literally dont see how the new thing is a Batlle pass
[4:57:07] Holysal: @cassetto yes it is
[4:57:08] cyrex172: i feel like subscription games should NEVER have paid battle passes
[4:57:09] Mr_Arson: no extra cost, its basically included in your sub now. Which is good because it adds value to your subscriptions
[4:57:10] gritbarontv: just your sweat and tears
[4:57:12] DrJBP: EU account?
[4:57:12] Nightjester31: I think this is a big W
[4:57:12] ChiefBeard: You work towards it.
[4:57:16] Benuker: I mean the cost of playing wow is outrageous enough
[4:57:16] xReadyAimMissx: yeah
[4:57:17] silodin: Ì counted along in my head
[4:57:18] fynnswow: @ThatUnfluffyPanda they're bad because it's a way to incentivize daily users over long term users. They just give you a chore to do to make you log in every day to "feel good" with the rewards they provide. It's like games coming out incomplete. They don't care about your experience as long as you're logging in everyday.

[5:51:35] actually_pierce: Zephyr is bugged i think, it doesn't increase movement speed like it says
[5:51:47] blueWoWblue: @Towelliee  you can add attack skills to the bar for dragonriding, then it will dismount you when you attack.  I put attacks in slots 1 and 2 and moves all the riding skills to slots 4-8
[5:51:51] Phoxzy: Zephyr isn't raid wide, its proximity based
[5:51:52] leimas: !origin

[6:08:45] Amerra: @91Niki I started joking with him about it being streamer server, and then he kept going. So I think he's leaning towards ignorant LUL

[6:09:53] mavericks312: @SeriousCrawdad his knee is still fucked apparently

[6:10:13] MackPlays: WoW was better when it took months to complete raids instead of days
[6:10:18] chillmodez: i thought +15 was entry levl mythic and then 20+ was the end mythic bosses

[6:10:40] purfessorplum: stupid that you even get raid level gear from doing them. Now it's just a requirement of guilds to be forced to do m+.
