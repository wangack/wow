[1:06:58] ssiissqqoo: ppc
[1:06:58] disar27: 100% agree, although. how do you ensure progression and players feeling they are getting more everytime?
[1:07:00] LonePuma: That was the case in SL but not DF... Also players are PISSED about the currently leggo being a low drop chance off Fyyrak

[1:07:34] thisyaboycam: The servers crashed lol
[1:07:36] frog_andy: legendaries are best when they are locked behind skill (infernal cape)
[1:07:43] Mahca_: gamers today feel like they should be able to get everything for some reason
[1:08:00] Mico027: Hard to get legendaries > Limited time legendaries
[1:08:10] BLUNDERGUN: i remember thinking of legendary items in vanilla like they were bigger than life
[1:08:26] wazza76: Mad should cover a whole 30 mins of barren chat lol!
[1:08:27] FinnMike: It kind of depends on the premise of why people want a certain mount. Is it prestige? Or is it because they like the aesthetic. For me, I only really want mounts that match my characters' tmogs :)
[1:08:43] snowizzy: exactly this Xar that made wow great aswell as server layers has ruint this feeling

[1:17:21] r_hanson: is tinder a 10 man raid?
[1:17:22] Shreddingly: If people don't rely on their communication skill in order to interact and form groups with strangers. They will no longer care to communicate with strangers
[1:17:23] Badbotqt: and people were stuck unhappy with someone for 60 years
[1:17:30] trkLata: LFG only made it accessible to the casuals. If you want to have a good group you still need comms lol. but I agree lfr shouldn‚Äôt be here.
[1:17:30] Mahca_: they should‚Äôve made lfr like lfg instead of rdf
[1:17:36] Erwincrates: is tinder a deep fire talent ?
[1:17:37] KDK_here: nice analogy
[1:17:38] bigwilly3737: madseason lets go
[1:17:38] espi: Is this dating advice, raiding advice or both?
[1:17:38] Exelai: really did not know where that was going but a very good point
[1:17:42] lolzandis: theres no ramifications for bad behavior in LFR
[1:17:44] nikodeemuz: yeah you gonna stick with it
[1:17:44] fivetailfox: I've had people quit on a pug i tried to make the first wipe
[1:17:46] voncline88: Wise words Xar
[1:17:46] Deomas11: Good point
[1:17:47] dashjuicy: LFR is only very entry gear though
[1:17:52] BarbsCozyCorner: the 4-6 hour raid grind evenings were a blast
[1:17:55] Fu11_sync: xar dating advice podcast pls
[1:17:55] itsBdaws: fr LOL
[1:18:04] adam_brisbane: yes because people worry so much about gear score and experience that makes some feel they never can get a group
[1:18:07] taylorsdank: @Fu11_sync "do handstands"
[1:18:12] LonePuma: @dashjuicy Yea everyone acts like it's the only end game raiding content... LFR is legit just a gear funnel
[1:18:14] baldanduseless: they should keep lfr out of cata classic and try to incentivize guild running
[1:18:18] Fu11_sync: @taylorsdank "eat bananas"
[1:18:18] wazza76: thats a song!
[1:18:19] Green_OPM: this is retail?
[1:18:19] baldanduseless: like they did with gdkp bans
[1:18:21] christofferjen02: this is actually such a good analogy
[1:18:31] dashjuicy: @dashjuicy ye it's kind of a stupid argument to make

[1:18:49] sneaks94: Xar, did you see the Elden Ring DLC gameplay trailer?
[1:18:49] theelder1312: i think they tried to make the game more casual friendly with the lfr..honestly..
[1:18:57] Fu11_sync: @taylorsdank fr fr potassium make your skin glow
[1:19:06] taylorsdank: @sneaks94 ya his reaction is on tik tok
[1:19:06] dutchsean: Damn good thoughts, Xar! I totally agree.
[1:19:09] daschadwick: Best part of raiding is comms with the homies though which is not a thing in LFR
[1:19:14] wiredotaku: Imagine playing an MMO thinking you aren't going to spend time earning things ....
[1:19:19] nikodeemuz: wotlk was the best iterantion imo u could dungeon as a casual as much as u wanted
[1:19:50] Gashunk1: some interpet actuall advice during a raid/dung as hostility, they are just as bad as the elitists

[1:21:58] Shreddingly: They couldn't level and play the base game being griefed by this event so they wanted to make it stop
[1:22:01] Sckarr1337: pretty sure there have been pandemic studies done based on that event
[1:22:06] blazzedzz: So tru POG
[1:22:09] teh_villain: in a few hours if you try lol

[1:23:28] Somra: laughs in SM spam
[1:23:33] chasingshadowsz: AMAZING
[1:23:41] CharsVicious: but i guess making everything super easy for everyone is what sells the most
[1:23:43] bigwilly3737: man this gives me chills
[1:23:48] acidaemia: catKISS
[1:23:49] BarbsCozyCorner: first time fighting onyxia was super memorable for me

[1:26:31] zavior88: @Xaryu i remeber towelliee one of the first wow streamers
[1:26:35] CharsVicious: @Mahca_ ofc it makes everything way easier, but also makes some other stuff harder like having to config your pvp addons so u are in the same level of advantage than others
[1:26:37] Voltaictv: the reckful IRL streams were soo good
[1:26:39] baldanduseless: we need some sort of pvp progression for sod

[1:26:48] Faasnukinbok: I started wow classic in 23, and oh man if you dont have any addon, you actually need to read the quest to where you need to go @Xaryu its time consuming but  good exprience I think
[1:26:48] Dr0ddy: I'm ready for a new mmo to come out. Doesn't have to kill WoW just always fun to play something new.
[1:26:52] ozewill: that makes sense brother
[1:26:55] Goldbowser: hit exalted defilers today. no reward at all. tabard quest is still lvl 60. and i would bet money lvl 60 rewards will be worse than lvl 50 raid loot.

[1:27:21] leiferikson4541: I understand arenas wouldnt work for balance reasons and I dont think they should balance classes around arenas but rather maybe have a arena rune that changes your abbilities only in arenas so that you still have class diversity in what is strong

[2:31:03] stroobzbeats: but you can make it the hype @Xaryu
[2:31:06] MoxAnvil: Only playing of they fix mob-tagging i think.
[2:31:07] Witality: It's fun to watch
[2:31:07] ciroq: 2
[2:31:08] DragoncakezZz: Please someone please tell me the name of the epic neck the mage had
[2:31:09] wJayto: HC is fun to watch i wouldnt play it
[2:31:09] hejrafa: watching hardcore streamers is cool though
[2:31:10] Pirivan: It‚Äôs great viewer content
[2:31:10] Whoopeepoop: they did the timing wrong
[2:31:12] donjuancon: 2
[2:31:16] darkowitz1444: I think for people who have reached 60 on one or multiple characters, it doesnt have much appeal
[2:31:16] MajinTV: blizzard took WAYYYY to long on solo self found
[2:31:16] kindaopmusic: they should make it were you have to delete your account LUL
[2:31:16] kleardeath: as much as I died lvling there is no way im playing HC
[2:31:17] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu, remember most just wanna watch HC not play
[2:31:19] EmilTuT: whats the spell on top bar nr2?
[2:31:20] kirk_hunts: Duskwood is crashed for me effectivlyt
[2:31:21] angryhatter: iunno why but open world feels empty for sod atm
[2:31:21] gothen123: Mr Jones will do the subathon for SSF
[2:31:26] kirk_hunts: this event is going down hill fast
[2:31:26] bryn_dee: If Xaryu plays it will become the hype - considering most people are already on their SoD alts
[2:31:27] skrubbe: hc ssf is very niche aswell, it has it's own little hardcore fanbase
[2:31:27] angelc843: This game was just never designed to be played that way.   SOD is far more enjoyable in every aspect.
[2:31:28] Mikayyy: @Whoopeepoop yeah they really fucked that up
[2:31:31] cxn_r: Prefer to watch than play
[2:31:33] mr__suppy: still pvping as frost?
[2:31:39] latenightsuckmeright: @angelc843 true and real
[2:31:39] gdkpgold: if they really wanted to they had the ressources to implent on hc launch but prefered to milk it now
[2:31:40] ScarletPaladin: I still think in addition to having the hardcore servers they should allow you to make a hardcore character on any other classic game mode
[2:31:42] ChristmasAndrew: ChristmasAndrew subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[2:31:43] bad19999993: @DragoncakezZz Piston Pendant
[2:31:46] bryn_dee: You do have that much pull
[2:31:50] toxicvenom406: you def have pull
[2:31:52] Mikayyy: i think you would be suprised
[2:31:52] mrbeggin89: How many blood coins do you have?
[2:31:54] ryaanshaw: why does frost do so poorly in gnomer?
[2:31:55] yellowgaiden: bro hardcore started because of u
[2:31:58] bryn_dee: SO MODEST
[2:31:59] Xzanelol: people will watch no matter what tho

[2:32:10] myyrlidon: best wow streamer
[2:32:10] toxicvenom406: you have a lot, you will get thousands to play
[2:32:11] hotpor123: you have enough pull to contact a gm and get my account back? :P
[2:32:14] Puhleazure: is mitch gonna play SSF?
[2:32:17] b1azzuris: maybe like an hour or two every day
[2:32:17] nikodeemuz: just like with every version of classic they tend to be to late when they get it
[2:32:27] bryn_dee: Ask Kai if he thinks you should play SF and since He can't talk  tell him to keep you up all night if yes and sleep thru the night if no
[2:32:29] griffinwish: are there still players playing normal hardcore?
[2:32:32] knifeparty818: HC SF is the truest of HC
[2:32:35] twobrat: hotpor123 nobody believes you had 2fa setup
[2:32:35] lichtv: hardcore will be fun  if no help from us.
[2:32:42] grylz89: If they would make it a fresh HC SSF launch, a ton of ppl would play
[2:32:42] Draxamius: you're probs the biggest *mostly* classic streamer
[2:32:42] swyftboi: Bro you hair looks great!
[2:32:43] NomarOgg: why is this chat so interested in mitch jeezus
[2:32:46] kulraven: i wish they would buff frost man, it feels like you should be able to live so long as frost but it really isnt the case, in bgs ive noticed at least.
[2:32:48] shothos: headset hair?
[2:32:50] ScryerTV: Bro just do it 50/50 its a valid strat

[2:33:06] andypandynz: @NomarOgg people like mitch attract people mitch
[2:33:09] Zikke_: no helldivers 2 bro?
[2:33:11] Xenocide321: HC SF just removes way too much of the social aspect of the game idk how it can be fun
[2:33:13] BlackRe3per: play Nightingale instead @Xaryu
[2:33:14] 19gandolf95: can u show your runes?
[2:33:21] lichtv: what class your wanna play on HC? if u start
[2:33:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @NomarOgg why you so interested in what people are interested in
[2:33:27] darkowitz1444: Hell divers looks cool
[2:33:27] NomarOgg: @andypandynz i legit can't stand any content he's in lol
[2:33:29] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[2:33:30] Loodimus: Zzzzzzzzzz

[2:41:11] xSaruTV: AB would be better with 10 players imo
[2:41:11] isleswitch: atleast its not SOTA
[2:41:11] teejway__: WSG needs a timer
[2:41:11] Anderzonx: WSG is the best what
[2:41:11] TheTrueShayde: does the stv lumber turn in give wsg rep or what rep is it? Diff rewards?
[2:41:11] nikodeemuz: i like both as much

[2:41:52] DPTDave: why are these people watching if they hate so much lol
[2:41:54] wrxbooosted: gnomer final boss needs to be nerfed
[2:41:58] andypandynz: @Hawke_89 thats a good start, can easily add one or two more sets or a diff exercise, but yeah calories in vs out for losing weight
[2:41:59] Mico027: Warrior not being top DPS is a plus for me
[2:42:00] focusd: @NotASkiller average League player mentality
[2:42:02] Semis394: how is SOD differernt than classic?
[2:42:02] AlarianYoneda: variety gameplay in 20yo game
[2:42:02] Fendersquire: gonna be really interesting to see whethere level 60's will be op in raid content with all the new runes
[2:42:06] sirkrekel: i mean , you are doing the same stuff every day tho :P i expected a bit more content in each phase :( i might pick up at max lvl tho
[2:42:07] mitchello85: to mona or not to moan, there is no question

[2:42:07] myyrlidon: xar how do i start strwaming
[2:42:07] ashmodean1234: @Xaryu do u think they'll keep a sod server perma after season is over?
[2:42:08] lambda__function: @wrxbooosted y
[2:42:09] bored_guy1: what does the HK thing mean that pops up on kill
[2:42:09] SlapdickWoWplayer: Do you think STV better or worse if everyone didn't become hostile and it was still faction vs faction
[2:42:10] pursuit644: p1 was so strong
[2:42:12] NotASkiller: @focusd I'm silver 2 :)
[2:42:15] Spikeqc: poroPls

[2:42:43] sighwarlock: @vayder250 hes not wrong
[2:42:49] Ervill1: If sod wasn't meant to be balanced, why is blizzard balancing it? Lol
[2:42:51] hejrafa: Do you think there is enough to DISCOVER in SoD?
[2:42:51] andypandynz: @Hawke_89 my point would be if ur goal is weight loss focus on the food intake and do what u enjoy in the gym :)
[2:42:52] Hawke_89: @andypandynz I've always wonder if  fasting +not workout is the same as   eating+workout
[2:42:53] NotASkiller: @andrewgape that's not that bad. iron and bronze is bad.
[2:42:55] myyrlidon: thats not what i meant
[2:42:56] damondse: ranged group ftw
[2:42:56] Zonex2004: If you weren't a streamer, would you be watching streamers regularly?
[2:42:57] oTrentx: Lmaoo
[2:43:13] Gagax2990: @Ervill1 ofc it was meant to be balanced
[2:43:16] andypandynz: @Hawke_89 thats above my paygrade might have to ask google that one haha
[2:43:21] pretty_cool_guy: BASED
[2:43:23] SilaarFR: I would like a forever looping SoD server
[2:43:24] bondaru07: @Xaryu your nemesis is aroud watch out !
[2:43:25] ScootSmith: some people have still yet to discover themselves
[2:43:25] val_blank: that requires effort though
[2:43:26] DrSwole: Probably easier for them to put abilities in
[2:43:28] StunningPaul: On Hardcore SSF will you get auto flagged going in enemy zones? Aka insta die
[2:43:31] TrueNosus: id agree with that tbh
[2:43:32] mr__suppy: i agree
[2:43:34] rewdebo8: how do u get frostfire bolt?
[2:43:37] Efaxz: lvl 40 3s
[2:43:38] Tovone: i would have developed the open world more
[2:43:38] Zonex2004: In your classic plus, you aren't taking into account dev time
[2:43:46] Yamamoto78: but this is the testing ground have to add everything and see what works
[2:43:48] gorthymog: deepfreeze lols
[2:43:52] Zonex2004: Making abilities is super easy compased to new content
[2:43:52] espi: deep freeze KEKW
[2:43:53] ngl85: @StunningPaul heroic servers are pve
[2:44:00] oTrentx: How long do SOD phases usually last?
[2:44:01] andypandynz: @Hawke_89 afaik its so negligible that you do what feels better for you, if u feel sick working out fasted just dont doit
[2:44:03] Glurpz: so wotlk mage :D
[2:44:03] latenightsuckmeright: sod has very little classic identity to classes
[2:44:14] isleswitch: they should make BRD 20 man raid SeemsGood
[2:44:14] shadowdragontv1: Well I just watched 3 20 second ads. I don't think I've ever watched an ad on this channel. I've usually been subbed
[2:44:15] EbbandFlow_: Sounds boring and not risk taken
[2:44:15] griffinwish: wotlk frost mage was peak mage
[2:44:16] bondaru07: @Xaryu watch out your nemesis is around you
[2:44:21] Titus20J: Tha'ts sort of what they did in p2, at least witht he runes
[2:44:23] 4F4Monteiro: !talents
[2:44:23] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[2:44:24] nikodeemuz: i think the rune getting isnt the real classic + what i was looking for thou i wished some real things i know what im asking is a lot
[2:44:29] willcantstream: frost mage is dead
[2:44:29] purplewingedboa: Survival hunter should have been a tank spec instead of rouge tanks.
[2:44:32] Hawke_89: @andypandynz yeah makes sense
[2:44:34] Gagax2990: just play era if you want to play classic
[2:44:48] griffinwish: @willcantstream NO
[2:44:50] Ervill1: Best thing would to have something to do end game and not just raid log
[2:45:13] Hawke_89: @andypandynz i feel fine working out fasted ..but i do like breakfast alot ..so idk haha.
[2:45:30] Gagax2990: @Ervill1 when has any version had more to do than raid and pvp?
[2:45:30] sunny_gee: escape artist kekw
[2:45:32] kinwicat: I thought gnomer was yesterday?
[2:45:34] andypandynz: @Hawke_89 yea just eat it it really doesnt matter
[2:45:36] espi: @Ervill1 you mean like a regular pvp event?
[2:45:38] nobleguyyy: whole sod is dead pvp wise
[2:45:40] Plokoon100: Yea ERA lmao.. 100g for a elixer of power
[2:45:43] latenightsuckmeright: the c danks
[2:45:46] BluntstepTV: era is king
[2:45:48] junro: junro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[2:45:58] andypandynz: @Hawke_89 working out is good for health but not essential for weight loss
[2:46:01] ScryerTV: yes 100%
[2:46:02] hot_souffle: That is SOD
[2:46:04] ScryerTV: this is too much
[2:46:05] latenightsuckmeright: more raids more loot .
[2:46:07] C00PAKiD: Do you think they should buff melee classes in the BM event?
[2:46:13] TrueNosus: i was really hoping they were gonna add more dungeons. like grim batol. or hyjal dungeon, or something that fits in the old world @Xaryu
[2:46:16] HazeyDayz_: this boomkin pumpingg
[2:46:20] ChildishNA: I think abilities like Ice Lance are good QOL for leveling
[2:46:23] logan_blaskie: I think it's good that they are trying things
[2:46:27] brotherbilly77: less is more
[2:46:30] imbener: so balance druid would still be useless :P
[2:46:31] nikodeemuz: less is more
[2:46:32] KhamulESO: we're not even at 60 yet tho tbf
[2:46:32] Taiya: i dont see the point of doing less. this is a new experience and the original is there for people that want it
[2:46:32] SgtDirtbag: I would‚Äôve definitely made the raids way harder
[2:46:35] Jonluke92: @xaryu roll 1-100. Whatever is the 1st number you get i donate
[2:46:36] SghettiBoy: I think SOD is very enjoyable as a direction for wow, but I agree it could even do less. New dungeons and raids would be exciting enough!
[2:46:36] latenightsuckmeright: @C00PAKiD no they have a role peel for your healer. and ranged very simple
[2:46:37] gorthymog: what do u think the lvl 50 raid is going to be
[2:46:38] lucasado1: jajaja
[2:46:42] 5thD5thD: i think when you look at mage, rogue, warrior, hunter, they already had pretty complete tool kits, hybrids like druids and shams, and spriest needed more of the runes
[2:46:43] lordsloths: new zone would be sick
[2:46:46] ftien17: i would prefer shorter periods between phases tbh
[2:46:51] hot_souffle: i dont get it why they add furry stuffs in wow
[2:46:56] yellowgaiden: sunken temple
[2:46:59] Hawke_89: @andypandynz yeah that does makes sense..okay
[2:47:13] Zonex2004: Devs have to treat players as this autonomous npc meta slave blob hivemind. Takes the fun out of classic
[2:47:17] nikodeemuz: i loved what they did with turtle wow but that + sod or something
[2:47:34] Ervill1: @gagax2990 did you just compare 1 sod raid and non rated pvp to wotlk and retail's content?
[2:47:40] yellowgaiden: i wonder what they are going to do at 60, with MC ZG AQ ony

[2:47:55] Gagax2990: @SgtDirtbag I agree, but at the same time that would make everyone look at your logs/only bring optimal comps and further exclude the more casual players

[2:50:34] Gagax2990: @Ervill1 there is only 1 raid in all wow expansions that actually gives upgrades, so yes. As of rated pvp, that probably is coming
[2:50:36] Yamamoto78: if he played one of the incomplete classes he would probably have a different opinion but since mage was already broken in classic...
[2:50:43] latenightsuckmeright: @Silas1411 im sure some wild quest route would be faster but on a pvp server and how populated they are sm for sure fastest

[3:22:11] snapLOUD: its correct, you only need 2 in the arcane hit with boots
[3:22:14] iamabirdttv: they arent skulls theyre low level dont need as much hit, its not wrong
[3:22:15] pizac7: its 6% with 1% that you cant avoid so its 5%
[3:22:15] sniped1414: It's because of the boss level this tier
[3:22:16] lebroswki: really doesn't make sens
[3:22:17] DlLDUCK: it is 5
[3:22:20] wrxbooosted: it‚Äôs 13%
[3:22:22] foolsendit: anyone know what addon hes using for talents to allow you to remove points before learning
[3:22:24] lemmfn: they are only +2 levels
[3:22:24] Eggzactly54: youre also only lvl 40
[3:22:27] enigmasvea: @Xaryu youve raided at 60, not 40 :)
[3:22:28] OMGamingTV: 5% in pvp
[3:22:28] baelz: they confirmed lvl up raids are 2 levels above
[3:22:29] Gorr82: its a level 40 raid tho
[3:22:29] leben_io: @Xaryu at 60 itll be higher
[3:22:32] baelz: bosses
[3:22:34] baelz: so you need 5
[3:22:34] ardice1: @xaryu bosses in leveling raids are only 2 levels above max. So 42 = 5% if they were 43 it was be 15%
[3:22:34] DlLDUCK: its because the bosses are only 2 lvls up instead of 3
[3:22:34] grantgatz: it's cause the bosses aren't +3
[3:22:36] miciahclay: @OMGamingTV 3 for pvp
[3:22:36] alrik_plays: @Xaryu Bosses at lvl 60 were Lvl 63, Bosses in Gnomer are Lvl 42
[3:22:37] enigmasvea: @Xaryu its simple math, its lvl 40 not 60
[3:22:38] kryfy: @Xaryu they lowered the bosses to +2 instead of +3 for sod,,hence the 5%

[5:17:46] Logic0311: imagine listening to this music when you're 80yo, the feels
[5:17:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @inhaledthc it was 99 for dps as a healer

[6:23:30] nerdtle: I would be upset
[6:23:30] SuperLost89: @Nandrolone11 yes
[6:23:31] NutterCircus: 5% would be fair
[6:23:33] Rozzoirl: undead riding cat is poggers
[6:23:33] tsetse2fly: Pog Hydra raid
[6:23:34] sengip: Is it safe to quest in STV yet or naw @Xaryu
[6:23:37] lion_the_ryan: i'd grind for it if they were faster
[6:23:37] zumwachi: Me cause they got exploited @Xaryu
[6:23:38] LordKelris: 5% is ok
[6:23:39] clamshell24: everyone would have the same mount
[6:23:39] sengip: Is it safe to quest in STV yet or naw @Xaryu ????
[6:23:40] beastvader: You seen elden ring dlc trailer?
[6:23:40] realandtruephobe: They should it's a farm and there's no real incentive to get it
[6:23:41] JamesIRL: hydra killed me today
[6:23:43] Bluptuous: AGM?
[6:23:43] StripSniper: it will make all toxic pvpers who camp corpses free reign
[6:23:44] ABigScaryDog: i just hop they scale to 100% at 60
[6:23:47] Playonwordz: where is pvp vendor for pvp rank??
[6:23:48] shloom995: ill get mount if they do that instead of rep
[6:23:48] SippinSimpSyrup: yes
[6:23:52] treyywow: they should have made all lvl 40 mounts 100% and epic riding could be 150% imo
[6:23:52] JamesIRL: I afk'd my bg because they were holding hostage
[6:23:52] thebookeu: paladins with talent would have 13% over others with pvp mount
[6:23:52] zumwachi: exploited
[6:23:55] Jgalatro: Jgalatro subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[6:23:55] clamshell24: yeah, everyone using the same mount looks dumb

[6:24:04] Playonwordz: where is pvp vendor for pvp rank @Xaryu ?
[6:24:05] Zoobeamer: imbalance = more fun for some, less fun for others
[6:24:05] Gabeko: yea then i could chase timmy's in open world and gank them
[6:24:08] kirbyfan1: I think they should do that but add a pvp way to grind the extra 5% in gnomer so pve and pvp people can obtain it both
[6:24:12] SmashTheDude: rev is enough
[6:24:13] voncline88: it would make all the other mounts obsolete

[6:27:46] edvano: 0.0001% will be in a duel turnament
[6:27:46] Astralthundr: 2 sec cast would be good balance to it
[6:27:47] edvano: So
[6:27:48] walkingded23: maybe if it gave more mana back
[6:27:51] squrixx: hard to survive as mage

[6:28:14] Nandrolone11: A channel would fix it because its risky to cast
[6:28:30] Xeevo: there are so many oneshots though, and this is the only one with a downside to it lol
[6:28:35] grkgemini94: do stv without 2 pocket healers and then revisit mage balance
