[11:51:14] Doribob1: wheres your robes
[11:51:15] harvenius: it makes the "assault" seem like a fight that mitch instigated and subsequetly lost. Mitch is a sausage
[11:51:21] Vicente_Prime: god warlocks are op
[11:51:24] srrymyfingerslip: yeah seems like the story, as vague as it is, can go whichever way the story teller wants it to go

[11:52:30] Snackybox: just woke up in Brexit land and people are already 40 in Gnomer what's going on OMEGALUL
[11:52:45] forest_elf_: sstvPls sstvPls sstvPls sstvPls sstvPls
[11:52:51] srrymyfingerslip: but I just seem like Mitch is a very non confrontational person,  but drugs and alcohol can change things. but if it got to the point where you had to drag a person out your car, whoever’s car it was, I would assume there has to be a reason
[11:52:52] tylerificus: @fuguelah seek help
[11:52:52] Kappadonna123: being a dumbass and high on coke doesnt mean someone can assault you although who could help not punching me lol

[12:43:57] Mind_G0bl1n: @SafariJoeTv fair enough
[12:43:58] wascii: we got a gold seller in chat
[12:43:59] thatquidproquo: They have 6 mages in the raid

[12:44:53] SafariJoeTv: I've been doing it for years
[12:44:53] thatquidproquo: true
[12:44:57] dave3ooo: unless they snitch
[12:45:09] Xammy0: @dave3ooo just like drug dealing
[12:45:19] Bagnasty: If a gold farmers dies does his family inherit his WoW gold?
[12:45:19] Mind_G0bl1n: buyer can snitch or use that as leverage/blackmail
[12:45:26] Zetherior: Full 3rd party communication gold trading is identical to streamers getting given gold, or vice versa
[12:45:32] Mickrispy: Selling gold was my main form of supporting my McDonalds addiction. Now im struggling.
[12:45:40] detimehascome: @Mind_G0bl1n gold buyer probably has a fuck ton of bot accounts to mass report u
[12:45:50] SafariJoeTv: You sell to your guild, and that's it. You launder it through the Gbank and it's done
[12:45:51] tex_oce: i buy gold and it just comes in mailbox as GDPK thanks
[12:45:59] Mind_G0bl1n: blizzard? humans? nah

[12:46:27] Mickrispy: AI would do better jobs than Blizzard Help
[12:46:31] SafariJoeTv: You don't trade it, you "Share it " with the guild and that gets alocated somewhere for something
[12:46:53] Mind_G0bl1n: give AI goal to stop gold sellers - ends up destroying capitalism fireKEK
[12:47:09] tex_oce: have to be unlucky to get cuaght

[12:47:18] TheDastardlyD: he showed me the email
[12:47:21] dave3ooo: usually they get whoever supplied the gold
[12:47:23] Zetherior: Everyone always assumes that gold trading is 1 to 1 in terms of seller to buyer, but its way more common that theres tons of escrow and middle men
[12:47:28] dave3ooo: and then just bans go out from there
[12:47:42] bazzzgg: Is most of the gold botted ?
[12:47:45] SafariJoeTv: If you go in whispers and you say "HEY MAN THANKS FOR THE MONEY HERE'S THE GOLD YOU BOUGHT" you deserve to be banned
[12:47:50] Mind_G0bl1n: i bought gold once they told me to send them some items in mail

[12:48:51] Zetherior: blizzard said the same thing about "existing gold" but its 100% Kapp
[12:49:22] corlune: theres instanced bosses that bots do and they went unnoticed for awhile
[12:49:31] beanman_gaming: just a random man in black lvl 77 npc just flash me
[12:49:35] TheDastardlyD: with the gold inflation in wotlk classic I'm guessing it's like 85% total from bots
[12:49:37] SafariJoeTv: A single dude farming mobs for gold like me and then selling it isn't a big deal, A botnet of hundreds is
[12:49:37] mondo091: How dare you make money off your hard earn gold right?
[12:49:37] Smokjoker: btw how are gdkp going to be treated now ? are they still stopping them? @StaysafeTV

[12:52:59] KGWay: Right

[14:58:13] libercan: It's interesting though if you also consider the mental aspect of it. I mean you could be as much hurt mentally from someone being hateful towards you. So is physical damage always worse than mental damage? It's tricky. Like mental abuse in a relationship.

[15:15:23] DeadDawg68: amen
[15:15:25] Axel7: true
[15:15:25] Catcoaster: So you want like 4 people to vote?
[15:15:27] something1808: that would be huge.. A
[15:15:27] sigilfish: general test and then specific test on the subject
[15:15:31] SleepyB0x: But then how would Democrats get votes?
[15:15:33] h2h_nillz: so retards cant vote?
[15:15:34] pisketti: When I see those pictures of the gang members all striped, shaved head, sat in little tightly packed lines to humiliate and demoralise them. It warms my heart FeelsOkayMan

[15:15:52] grizzlyhead: I agree
[15:15:54] SupreemLeeder11: YEP at least they will be 4 smart pepole
[15:15:59] DanPenaa: 100%. i mean if taylor swift saying "vote for x" can be so significant for an election. that is disturbing. @StaysafeTV
[15:15:59] b0ndl: I believe only taxpayers should vote, cuz they pay for the party. also everyone working for the state or country shouldn't vote
[15:16:05] pappej: BASED
[15:16:08] something1808: old ppl shouldnt be able to vote about everything either i.e. things that wont affect them they shouldnt be able to vote about like future policies for students etc doesnt make sense for old ppl to vote about
[15:16:21] JohnnyBoySilver: @StaysafeTV Who decides whos competent? Oke the test.. but who decides on whats in the test? Kinda goes back to the who decides argument you use alot right?
[15:16:28] bra1Ndoq: who determines what should be asked in the test tho?
[15:16:39] DanPenaa: ppl vote based on what taylor swift says. that says enough. we either need to raise the age voting limit, or a test, like stayafe suggests
[15:16:50] Fredthegred: @something1808 i see your point, but then no one would fight for eldercare politics
[15:16:57] normageqq: i think political party manifestos should be given to read and choose with no indication of which party it is and certain percentage of the claims of the party need to be actioned or the party is punished harshly
[15:17:00] AlexGottsche: The fact you think this is a good idea means you wouldn't be able to vote
[15:17:12] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV are you still an aquarium enjoyer?
[15:17:13] SupreemLeeder11: KEKW Ya seriously, if your IQ is below 100, why are you voting?
[15:17:16] Mind_G0bl1n: in reality you vote with money on the public stock market and the ceo's take care of herding the sheep
[15:17:19] Link9286: fight club discord would be PISSED
[15:17:20] sigilfish: i think non-iq test would be better than IQ test
[15:17:22] satrivac: @StaysafeTV what dungeons did u do in order by lvl ?

[15:17:54] feelabix: your dum 😂😂
[15:18:12] pisketti: @normageqq interesting idea but there's no way the manifestos could stay anonymous
[15:18:25] Mind_G0bl1n: if people really dont like woke, divest from blackrock and problem will be fixed within a week
[15:18:29] keelew: I think the majority of ppl are stupid and agree but it's problematic who decides what is on that test tbh
[15:18:36] Whezyk_: But then how can you control them if they are not stupid? :P
[15:18:42] dave3ooo: iq isn't the best was to judge competency tho

[17:38:56] BajeniZta: NOPE!
[17:39:00] soiceymane: sod will become retail at 60 with more than 40 runes
[17:39:02] morat_g: We need real classic plus
[17:39:03] DanPenaa: we need to get the taylor swift fans out of the voting system. setting a 28 year age minimum requirement would do the job

[17:40:51] xtd86: Do u guys enjoyed cata?
[17:40:52] Avenia: @DanPenaa no they are just biased and aging closer to being non contributors to society.
[17:40:53] graeme_tbm: I think tbc did an OK job of it, not as good as vanilla but much better than wrath anyway
[17:40:56] Andiells: i never played Vanilla but last 2-3 years i fell in love with classic / sod
[17:40:59] pawsy4: @StaysafeTV can you solo dungeon as sham like you are doing ?
[17:41:04] soiceymane: id have that beast fishing day to day
[17:41:13] Sprattelskum: @carlos_the_7th Well I guess it could be a dialect thing, but it's just that the proper spelling is fläskött, the pronounce is different like u said tho :p
[17:41:19] soiceymane: also. orc?
[17:41:19] plumpus81: where's the counter???

[17:43:42] Varels1: @EmanuShow i just checked a couple recipes and for what it's worth that's how I like to make it as well. celeri, carrots & bay leaves are important for the flavor composition imo

[17:45:42] InflatableSloth: what runes are you using?
[17:46:01] legionnaire09: the problem in wow is simple, in every expansion you have only ever moved in the expansion. blizzard has to adapt the game so that every area has a meaningful use.
[17:46:14] EmanuShow: Sibylla is like swedish mcdonalds but better
[17:46:25] raspyoftow: the moments your corpse is righting on zeplin

[17:49:36] AaahhRealAliens: I hear the graveyards are fucked and people camp them
[17:49:37] omarali118: It'll be hard to tell imo until some sort of meta forms
[17:49:37] spoonjazzler: it looked fun as fuck but you cant go to a town or the npc's kill u
[17:49:38] parmejohn__: what level are you?
[17:49:40] Gritzxv: How the hell do you make it to the reset spot in gy without dying lol
[17:49:49] woods6868: the stv event seems decent

[17:50:50] Phalloides60: romanitizing being a normie
[17:50:50] TallTrips: Have another kid lol
[17:50:50] omarali118: You get more dopamine when you let it save up for awhile
[17:50:54] AaahhRealAliens: that’s me right now
[17:50:54] Afterh8: interesting
[17:50:56] omarali118: kek
[17:50:56] Afterh8: wow edging
[17:50:59] Subparferal: i've been unemployed for 3 months, it's relatable to me Sadge
[17:51:02] kaiju_kin: anticipation is often greater than the act

[17:51:06] halflifez3: I feel ya
[17:51:07] gothen123: Called time off
[17:51:09] palanim_: I have nearly no time to play but its another feeling just working and consuming gaming content, feels good weirdly and builds some hype for no reason @StaysafeTV
[17:51:11] Frank4LuLz: NORMAL
[17:51:15] Varels1: it's the foreplay
[17:51:19] wookieenthal: deadlySSC
[17:51:32] icylemons1993: KEKW
[17:51:35] SwedishRepresentative: you hype yourself up when you are restricted from playing
[17:51:38] TheEndIsNear777: that's why we need Microsoft to make WOW 2, EVERYTHING NEW :)
[17:51:39] JohnnyBoySilver: I have that PoE.. I sit at work just thinking all day about getting home and killing bosses
[17:51:41] EffinsTV: @StaysafeTV I need to leave for a couple of hours, but ill leave the stream up. Least I could do for the gifted sub I received. Oop
[17:51:42] Varels1: its not the same if you go straight into pounding goblins all days on end without the anticipation
[17:51:43] deedz420: I don’t know this feeling as I’m on welfare all my life playing wow
[17:51:45] evn_ff: 100% know that feeling. I wfh now so I can play whenever, but literally used to get through the day by prepping my night in WoW LOL
[17:51:45] Atomized: but ya know, you don't get that kindof... planning or forethought when you're just...playing, non stop
[17:51:46] soiceymane: the feel of sitting your no #3 hunter even though hes the nicest gu

[17:52:28] icylemons1993: mmos are cozy af
[17:52:44] BlackPhoeniix: why
[17:52:53] JohnnyBoySilver: @Afterh8 Yooo riding my little bicycle to the store to buy physical game time cards was PEAK
[17:52:56] barrekaz: Is it better to solo dungeons rather than go grouped?
[17:53:07] Afterh8: that golden moment when u get the game card
[17:53:08] Varels1: drain that boi Kappa
[17:53:11] xXxSupahDupah: Do you mind telling why you picked orc over undead for warlock? @staysafetv

[17:54:20] soiceymane: why vs trolll?
[17:54:21] brawlick2711: :O
[17:54:23] palanim_: how much xp would you get from a quest?
[17:54:23] Aculus: hell yea i dig it
[17:54:31] Aculus: cannibilize feels so good on lock tho
[17:54:36] carlos_the_7th: @soiceymane trolls can't be warlock unfortunately
[17:54:36] seymourmoney: So is the marathon over? I don't see a timer anymore

[17:54:39] ripperofbong420: i mean who doesnt want to be jacked
[17:54:50] Blackout_x9: orc is rp bis
[17:54:50] desst1: why ugly orc male tho 4Head
[17:54:51] TheEndIsNear777: orcs can bench press 700 lbs and undead only 200 lbs so he chose orc GIGACHAD
[17:54:52] thatquidproquo: @Aculus facts
[17:54:54] AmarokUnchained: pepeD
[17:55:03] colt_1888: is orc the one with increase to pet damage also?
[17:55:20] soiceymane: so i think gdkps got banned because of certain people they cant ban due to pr
[17:55:29] Varels1: @colt_1888 ya and stun resist
[17:55:31] Aculus: @colt_1888 yea by 5% but lock pets are a tiny amount of lock dps
[17:55:32] palanim_: @TheEndIsNear777 i can do 240lbs so im better than undead FeelsStrongMan
[17:55:54] Aculus: stun resist is the most op pvp passive in the game tho
[17:55:57] soiceymane: gold guying celebs
[17:55:58] Varels1: @soiceymane idk about that. disabling GDKP is easier than hunt down everyone
[17:56:07] WillyBeamish: that was the dumbest comment of the day
[17:56:09] soiceymane: yes
[17:56:27] vasily_zee: banning gdkp's because tucker interviewed putin
[17:56:28] soiceymane: they deffs banned cause of gold buying
[17:56:29] TheEndIsNear777: @palanim_ nice! new race confirmed. Called "Palanim" :)
[17:56:42] icylemons1993: dang you are pumping
[17:56:48] deeesou: Yo @StaysafeTV slightly offtopic, but did you get any gear from these runs or are you still just blasting it in the BFD BIS? Love the streams
[17:56:53] palanim_: @TheEndIsNear777 yes, it might be a mix between a dwarf and human KEKW
[17:56:58] palanim_: Guten Tag mein Freund @StaysafeTV

[17:57:32] NaManDatAintMe: ballin tank lock pants
[17:57:37] deeesou: nice, hoping to do the same on hunt
[17:57:42] Aculus: anybody else really wish they made SM the raid for this phase instead of frickin gnomer
[17:58:18] soiceymane: i kept saying sm will be 50
[17:58:21] soiceymane: new never seen
[17:58:26] soiceymane: but now i think ST
[17:58:41] icylemons1993: thougts on guildwars return?
[17:58:51] icylemons1993: thaughts*
[17:58:57] Aculus: yeah probably ST that place is cool and they could do a lot with it
[17:59:03] icylemons1993: nvm thoughts was correct
[17:59:06] soiceymane: itll be ST
[17:59:13] realyoeri: he’s still live, the madman
[17:59:18] soiceymane: theyre doing the instances that were never touched
[17:59:23] soiceymane: to make it fun
[17:59:23] xxLucas: You dont even look tired

[17:59:32] atlasforge: Whoa solo grind?  Impressive.  No metamorph?
[17:59:51] Metaphix: you dead tired yet?
[18:00:05] AmarokUnchained: the solo grind is crazy :D
[18:00:05] icylemons1993: You look fresh  considering 18h

[18:00:46] soiceymane: big disagree
[18:01:16] lizcat_: valheim streams were cozy
[18:01:21] realyoeri: NotLikeThis
[18:01:22] JK100: He's a Pokemon gamer.
[18:01:23] soiceymane: i suck at FPS
[18:01:29] soiceymane: thats why i dont play
[18:01:31] icylemons1993: i main wow , and cs 2 on the side
[18:01:31] AmarokUnchained: monogamer POG
[18:01:35] Mcflury1705: Did Ahmpy lvl through dungeons?
[18:01:36] Advice305: You seem to enjoy Elden Ring though
[18:01:45] soiceymane: osrs?
[18:01:48] soiceymane: or rs3?
[18:01:49] Cafe0le: that forsen tekken 8 clip on lsf OMEGALUL
[18:01:49] xxLucas: Diablo 2 and WoW for me
[18:01:51] EEORH: Ive never played wow
[18:01:52] Varels1: wow has a unique appeal to it
[18:01:54] icylemons1993: New worlds nice tho
[18:01:58] soiceymane: full send osrs
[18:02:03] thatquidproquo: i miss new world
[18:02:06] icylemons1993: my pc cant handle it  unfortunatly
[18:02:10] Metaphix: same, classic wow just has such a cozy atmosphere and vibe
[18:02:21] Varels1: i never tried new world
[18:02:22] fanofthebengals: new world could be perfect in the right hands
[18:02:23] atlasforge: What server are you on?
[18:02:24] AmarokUnchained: SoD is the best wow version so far
[18:02:30] Phalloides60: those first 3-4 days of new world were fucking sick
[18:02:31] Cashmere_kat: I would sub and try sod if they increased the nameplate range but its too jarring to go down to 10/15 or w/e it is
[18:02:33] colt_1888: i stopped playing about half way through tbc classic and SoD has really got me hooked again @StaysafeTV
[18:02:42] soiceymane: 100
[18:02:42] TallTrips: I dont know about that I still play OSRS
[18:02:45] palanim_: Because of my new position I was able to effort a 3k computer that can handle every game but I also have no time to game anymore KEKW Thats life
[18:02:46] icylemons1993: big true
[18:02:58] legionnaire09: you have to wait for ashes of creation! that will kill every other mmo
[18:03:11] Avenia: aoc = residentsleeper
[18:03:17] Stevenseagullol: the first 3-4 weeks of RIFT was some of the best mmo experience i ever had, sad the devs didnt really care for it so endgame was dead and the game soon died and became paytowin ish
[18:03:26] AmarokUnchained: AoS seems already niche
[18:03:36] AmarokUnchained: erm. AoC
[18:03:48] Avenia: @Stevenseagullol i was the first max level on my server in rift and we had a nice guild, the end game was so boring, and there was so little do do at cap
[18:03:52] Varels1: i quit wow to focus more time on crypto, yet here I am watching a wow streamer
[18:03:57] soiceymane: big streamers playing wow brought a big community
[18:04:08] soiceymane: and playing horde makes it all that better
[18:04:11] warn1ng: quarter3
[18:04:13] spy_bones: q3 this year
[18:04:17] realyoeri: Did you do a stream for the Putin interview btw? Would be content
[18:04:23] holybreaker1: what about the Riot MMO
[18:04:42] Cafe0le: NODDERS
[18:04:43] markja629: it has New World super fun for 2-3 months vibes
[18:04:44] Stevenseagullol: @Avenia yeah we did a lot of shard firsts aswell on our server, but yeah sad they hadnt thought of endgame at all and didnt do anything for it the first year or so
[18:04:46] Atomized: YEP
[18:04:47] AmarokUnchained: Gayge
[18:04:48] donkeebrainz: 100%
[18:04:51] JohnnyBoySilver: Ghostcrawlers out :(
[18:04:51] grizzlyhead: I don't think so
[18:04:59] JohnnyBoySilver: But very interested in Ghostcrawlers new project
[18:05:06] JohnnyBoySilver: Yeah exactly
[18:05:07] saronitebomb: all their current games are skins
[18:05:08] phdinbullshit: Riot cant even come up with original ideas all they do is rehash games
[18:05:13] Vicente_Prime: 0 dbout
[18:05:17] Vicente_Prime: 0 doubt about that
[18:05:25] JohnnyBoySilver: Apparently Danuser is out from Blizz since last november.. left quietly
[18:05:26] Varels1: @JohnnyBoySilver what's the game he is working on now? Shadow?
[18:05:28] desweck: dunno riot has great combat
[18:05:29] Metaphix: SOD and classic era vs retail and wotlk you can really feel how the token has effected the vibe of the game. i can farm gold in SOD and not feel like a complete retard
[18:05:39] realyoeri: its chinese owned so it’s over anyway
[18:05:45] chaparrosky1: good morning staysafe could  you show me what runes are you running?
[18:05:49] twistiidfate: Where is the subathon timer
[18:05:50] JohnnyBoySilver: @Varels1 https://www.ign.com/articles/greg-ghostcrawler-street-returns-with-new-mmo-codenamed-ghost
[18:06:09] Varels1: @realyoeri idk they express they have a lot of freedom. more so than any previous position
[18:06:17] JohnnyBoySilver: @realyoeri PoE is owned by Tencent and is fantastic :)
[18:06:27] 125christian125: @Metaphix I feel like a complete retard playing with with these RMT geeks. But you're saying its worthwhile?
[18:06:29] Avenia: @JohnnyBoySilver not owned.
[18:06:29] Atomized: imagine a ghosts of tsushima style mmo
[18:06:31] realyoeri: CCP agents in chat
[18:06:39] realyoeri: KEKW
[18:06:43] JohnnyBoySilver: @Avenia Shouldve said partly owned ur right
[18:06:44] Avenia: @JohnnyBoySilver tencent has a 10% steak in GGG
[18:06:46] Idahorazor: I'm on of the weirdos that loves both classic and retail. Only have time to really play one MMO at a time, so I swap back and forth between classic wow and retail heh.
[18:06:47] Varels1: @JohnnyBoySilver right, ghost. odd name for an mmo imo
[18:06:56] Vunoka: wow looks better than anything from UE
[18:06:58] markja629: mmos need an art style
[18:06:59] Atomized: you know, theoretically, an engine should *not* dictate the artstyle. but devs are lazy.
[18:07:07] AmarokUnchained: ccp, mossods, feds
[18:07:23] 125christian125: true
[18:07:24] Metaphix: @125christian125 yeah RMT is there but not as prevalant is with the token. especially now that they banned GDKP's that will help
[18:07:30] AmarokUnchained: timeless
[18:07:30] ninjaskurk: valheim
[18:07:31] handpickedbytim: how goes the grind mr safe peepoCute
[18:07:33] WOZHIDAOGONGFU: wow's shitty graphics are what give it soul
[18:07:34] TWOIIC: sea of thieves
[18:07:37] JohnnyBoySilver: @StaysafeTV Playing Hollow Knight right now.. maybe my favourite graphics in any game and is handdrawn
[18:07:38] Atomized: fortnite is actually pretty technically demanding these days
[18:07:39] palanim_: Unreal Engine is powerful but everything looks like the same. I love when MMOs or Games have their own style. WoW Graphics never get old IMO
[18:07:40] Varels1: DotA 2 looks great also
[18:07:44] ninjaskurk: terraria
[18:07:45] Avenia: "art style" > Ultra Realstic
[18:07:52] Aurkus: happy to hear a different opinion on the riot mmo. ive heard other streamers and even irl friends who are all like i cant wait to quit wow for the riot mmo. and im here just like i dont think itll b as good as yall think.
[18:07:52] Ropy123: it about art style not graphics, a good visual design
[18:07:54] Krtex: Graohics in wow are turboserious, sodaHmm
[18:07:55] holybreaker1: some developers focus more on graphics than actual gameplay and coding
[18:07:56] seksmuhchine: doc holliday?
[18:07:59] realyoeri: wc3 is peak artstyle
[18:08:03] realyoeri: timeless
[18:08:07] Varels1: @realyoeri +
[18:08:12] grizzlyhead: Woah dude the graphics looks insane in this game BatChest
[18:08:17] Metaphix: all unreal games just look so samey. They also don't have the incredible responsiveness that wow does
[18:08:23] Avenia: @Aurkus its going to be good, but its going to be very niche
[18:08:31] Avenia: Riot has gigacash
[18:08:37] grizzlyhead: YEP
[18:08:38] Avenia: and a great world built
[18:08:39] Atomized: that's how WoW was built
[18:08:42] re5onxnce: you ever have a wow dream?
[18:08:52] Atomized: it was heroes they were trying to emulate from wc3 heroes
[18:08:53] Avenia: There was lore
[18:08:54] Varels1: @grizzlyhead bro how did you get your GIGACHAD Battlerite tag?

[19:49:49] Slesky: @TheWhiteRabbitxX people need to understand....this is still a Classic WoW Raid...like it's not gonna be difficult with a tryhard group

[19:49:54] NaManDatAintMe: he doesnt like the good stuff
[19:49:57] IR_ish: we go to 60
[19:50:25] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @slesky I agree with you and it shouldn’t be. but for a new raid at our max level that has no PTR where people need to figure it out. should take slightly longer imo
[19:50:26] Nille4mat: Can't believe he's almost 40 already, solo dedication right there
[19:50:34] Doribob1: retail gargles my balls
[19:50:45] mysteriousm4n: Deadge
[19:50:57] origin727: Damn you're pumping. How's it looking, pretty competitive on speed to 40 by soloing?
[19:51:04] Slesky: @TheWhiteRabbitxX It's going to end up taking longer for normal people who are 4 guildies and maybe 6 pugs for example

[19:51:52] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @slesky for sure and I expect nerfs this week or some hotfix maybe for some class. so later group raids will be more difficult— true
[19:52:12] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Although now they can just copy struts so that component is kinda gone, which does suck a little
[19:52:18] Slesky: @TheWhiteRabbitxX yea they will def be tuning some classes who are above and beyond in damage

[20:19:52] Atomized: it ads rested XP I believe
[20:20:01] Faedrik: @StaysafeTV If they release "Classic+" with just SOD content, how well do you think it would do? Is it the novelty factor of new stuff, or is it genuinely good content?
[20:20:03] PhokingTV_: oh ok
[20:20:05] Emmune: @fghtingspirit_2022 ah
[20:20:07] NoodlePersonagain: yeah its like 3% more exp and thats it

[20:20:59] Faedrik: I mean, instead of level bands it's just all available from the start. Will it have the same longevity?
[20:21:06] GwynEUW: this is too big a hit for it not to be
[20:21:08] 4ddic7: Im woke af and that made no sense

Menthol ciggerattes are considered girl ones cuz guys typically don't do the minty flavoured ciggy. Supposedly it's banned to prevent kids getting hooked. When I heard that I instantly thought about how vapes are not and flavoured ciggies jist aren't a thing, do you know anything about this?
