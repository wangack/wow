[3:47:48] kaw_kaw: WW is a level 30 boost thing and a horde thing. Ally gets bonebiter
[3:47:57] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw its a right of passage from when a warrior goes from a baby shitter to a real warrior

[3:48:58] Steelwulf: I chose the Mace, got everyone asking if i had arms mace spec...
[3:49:02] Geri_0123: and there was the zf sword
[3:49:09] magisterofquelthalas: "Natural drop"?
[3:49:19] Human_r0bot: Kang dropped 100% if you took the sword. That's why the drop chance was so low
[3:49:23] Thundie: Is ZF sword lvl 50?
[3:49:24] bergbergen: Still have ZF mace on my druid
[3:49:26] doobiemoto: I got it in one run once
[3:49:32] skydoom: thats painfull
[3:49:46] marblewobble: what about WIndfury? Blessed blade of the windseeker?
[3:49:46] P4rappa: Had the ZF sword on a Hunter EZ
[3:49:49] BetaFlame00: i farmed the ZF sword once when Warlocks got the ability to transmog their felguard weapon
[3:50:04] little_bobby_69: @Thundie yes, 50
[3:50:10] Geri_0123: maybe in p3
[3:50:28] Nonnar: What do we think the 50 raid will be, Mara?
[3:50:43] Miskav: Sunken temple
[3:50:46] ArjanaEU: mara?
[3:50:49] Phabey: ZF would be really fun
[3:50:50] Jarless: ST
[3:50:51] WaRsoN67: sunken ttemple
[3:50:53] Beerplz: ZF
[3:50:53] Zziggz: I reckon Zulfarrak
[3:50:53] probablyglowe: mara or st
[3:50:54] Jaydenhaze: one thing i'm really missing is the fog from low view range. like 50 meters ahead of you
[3:50:55] majkos: karazhan
[3:50:56] little_bobby_69: Mara od Sunken?
[3:50:56] Hellnolf: I want it to be Sunken Temple
[3:50:58] Hyvest: Temple is more iconic I feel like
[3:51:00] Yurian33: take that back!
[3:51:00] Horfent: Zul'Farrak or Sunken Temple. Anything else and ill be Madge
[3:51:01] Hellnolf: to give us a reason to go to ST
[3:51:02] Colddaylight: Zul 'Farak
[3:51:04] Thundie: so many good dungeons around that level
[3:51:05] Allessii: Sunken temple
[3:51:05] Tjapneus: either Sunken Temple or Mara
[3:51:05] flyingdutchw: Preach is in the knows...√ñP
[3:51:06] WaRsoN67: Temple has the class quests
[3:51:08] Human_r0bot: What's wrong with farting princess???
[3:51:08] doobiemoto: The leaked image was SM but who knows
[3:51:09] fibriz1: i like maraudon it's cool!
[3:51:09] ArjanaEU: I love mara </3
[3:51:09] Geri_0123: that's why it's a good choice, to rework it
[3:51:12] Killage: Itlll be BRD because they want us to suffer
[3:51:20] Voltikun: Honestly nice change to not go for WW axe. So many wanted to go for it instantly, but the SM runs were just good
[3:51:23] drdisasterttv: Sunken Tempel?
[3:51:23] Thornefield: Wasn't the Karazhan Crypts supposed to be a thing?
[3:51:25] Enoz___: Dire Maul maybe?
[3:51:28] kaw_kaw: I need ZF to not be a raid so I can farm the GY thnx
[3:51:30] little_bobby_69: The Temple of Atal'Hakkar
[3:51:35] HeyitsMew_: making ZF a raid would "eliminate" mages farming it, same for mara?
[3:51:39] Nupss: imagine if it's SM KEKW
[3:51:40] gettincranky: Maybe SM under new management
[3:51:40] Ducklettz: Could do part of BRD
[3:51:42] mobbeh: BRD maybe?
[3:51:46] Mordarim: they teased scarlet and kara f√ºr the 50 and 60 bracket
[3:51:53] little_bobby_69: Scholomance Pog
[3:51:57] Atticon: BRD is already a raid really
[3:52:05] Cas_final2: Ragefire Chasm raid, make it really interesting for Alliance to get to
[3:52:12] zielis_the_noodle: Stratholm better become a raid at 50
[3:52:16] eximisprime: SM Graveyard
[3:52:18] zielis_the_noodle: 60*
[3:52:18] ArjanaEU: no
[3:52:18] Zziggz: no
[3:52:21] kaw_kaw: was closed at 25
[3:52:22] vistrix876: I'm thinking Maraudon is next
[3:52:22] MortiousPrime: no
[3:52:24] GeordieMarauder: nope
[3:52:27] fibriz1: question is what changes they gonna do actual raids o.O
[3:52:28] Braggardt: Use that mysterious stormwind portal for a new raid 5Head
[3:52:33] BurtikShaun: uldaman
[3:52:38] Miskav: I still think its gonna be ST + Scholo for phase 3 + 4
[3:52:39] Eightbitmailbox: Didn't they tease SM for something back in blizzcon?
[3:52:41] Pwinzor: sunken temple would be good
[3:52:41] hierophants: Sunken temple
[3:52:46] Thornefield: @Braggardt Simulating FF14 housing market pre-lottery? Oh no
[3:52:58] Thundie: ST would be my number 1 choice, not ran as much as others back in the day
[3:53:04] little_bobby_69: Temple
[3:53:11] Geri_0123: that guild name tho Sussy
[3:53:20] TSAK46: TSAK46 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! pgeNom
[3:53:22] nf_zariche: classic undead
[3:53:25] DozlaT: They could Indiana Jones ST, could be fun
[3:53:29] Anexros: ST would make a good raid but they would have to make a ingame map for that place, always get lost lol
[3:53:30] ArjanaEU: ST;s layout is dogwater though
[3:53:30] Thundie: as was BBFD and gnomer, were overlooked for other 5 mans
[3:53:32] magisterofquelthalas: Undead scum!
[3:53:35] bananadyret: I pray for Dire maul being a raid
[3:53:36] little_bobby_69: it already has like 8 bosses
[3:53:39] bananadyret: or maraudon
[3:53:40] little_bobby_69: fits in the lenght of raids
[3:53:50] little_bobby_69: either mara od temple imo
[3:53:55] marblewobble: Chef?  in game?   no.... IRL?  also no
[3:54:02] Impurite: @Thunderbrew gnomer gets skipped because it's annoying as hell.
[3:54:12] Human_r0bot: Mara all sides combined into one raid makes the most sense
[3:54:22] bananadyret: @Impurite they actually did a really good job with the raid compared to BFD
[3:54:22] BurtikShaun: they did tease SM raid or kara crypts raid so they are not opposed to creating something completely new
[3:54:25] str4ysheep: didn't they tease gnome, sm and kara crypts at blizzcon?
[3:54:25] GeordieMarauder: what level was scholomance back in classic?
[3:54:27] Cas_final2: Dire maul but give everyone a free 100% speed mount that only works inside dr
[3:54:39] jkprm: shadowlands SOD when?
[3:54:43] KelticNight: Gnomer's layout was designed by a crazy person in the midst of a drug-fuelled mania
[3:54:45] magisterofquelthalas: Oh yeah! There was a chef ogre around here but shouldnt there be piles of meat?
[3:54:54] mobbeh: no way they dont do BRD as a raid at some point right?
[3:54:56] Geri_0123: or the originals will be 20/25
[3:55:06] doobiemoto: @Preachlfw I hope they bring back the cut Furbolg raid in Azhara. Supposedly that was supposed to be one, the fort up in the top left
[3:55:07] kaw_kaw: Kara Crypts as the level 50, into the normal level 60 raids + whatever future raids after naxx Shruge
[3:55:09] Braggardt: I acually predict they'll knock MC et al to 20 man
[3:55:14] Nahzdro: @jkprm season of despair
[3:55:25] Human_r0bot: They could also do something like stratholme and lower the levels
[3:55:34] Taaag: Taaag subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! clown
[3:55:37] jkprm: @jkprm true lol
[3:55:38] zielis_the_noodle: I want stratholm as a raid
[3:55:43] Gaz_Games_: weren't there cooking ogres in dustwallow?
[3:55:44] Braggardt: Season of Mastery did something like that, right?
[3:55:48] tinyjazzhands: LIVING BOMB PANIC
[3:55:56] Ducklettz: the clown TTS gets me everytime
[3:56:05] soren111999: wait you want a boss with both a bomb and a fear mechanic that sounds a little overtuned
[3:56:09] fibriz1: BRD rraid, but not sure how they could do it since its so long
[3:56:15] thestew1337: BRD as a raid omg
[3:56:16] Braggardt: Given the hints they showed at Blizzcon it looks like we're getting something brand new for our SM raid
[3:56:20] Human_r0bot: Scholo is one of their best designed dungeons imo
[3:56:22] thestew1337: the potential
[3:56:43] Anexros: MC 10 man would be kinda cool, that way everyone has to do mechanics, i feel like 20 man mechanics would get glossed over
[3:56:43] magisterofquelthalas: It is grindy
[3:56:45] little_bobby_69: WAIT NO MYTHIC RAIDS ?!
[3:56:45] doobiemoto: @Preachlfw Did you do Gnomer yet?
[3:56:46] Geri_0123: something on the retail normal level would be nice, not hard but at least something happens
[3:56:48] anjilo: i expect it to at least force me to engage my brain
[3:56:52] Miskav: They're not gonna throw a mythic in here, no
[3:56:58] Human_r0bot: 650 wipes on garr
[3:57:01] thestew1337: gnomer requiers some cordination for shure. but its prty fun :)
[3:57:03] Braggardt: Yeah, people are claiming Gnomer is hard but I'm guessing that's hard for classic players who struggle with living bomb
[3:57:06] Skoragon: Back in vanilla our warlock team would do an all warlock party in scholo after raids, I don't even remember why but it was good fun
[3:57:10] Woawiee: tell that to the sweats gatekeeping raids on NA lol
[3:57:14] Nupss: @Braggardt KEKW
[3:57:15] soren111999: pleb mentality. this game is absoloutely not about having fun
[3:57:19] Rem753: @Braggardt hard in terms of classic, i think it has some naxx mechanics KEKW

Stopped playing until WOD when I came back, was unable to access my account. Contacted Blizzard support and my account was restored. Interesting was that I now got bunch of WoTK and MoP achivments and tons of rare mounts from drops and bosses that I know i had not defeated. I wonder if it was because the vanilla account was transferred and the GM ticked too many boxes when?

[4:50:59] Vio9: my RuneScape account got hacked at some point in the years I hadn't played, recovered it and had 92 out of 99 Mining skill KEKW
[4:51:01] monitus0: @CrerisRs Yeah because you can't sell a character for gold in a legit way. Are you sure there wouldn't be a market for that if you could do that within the TOS?
[4:51:01] Umseslad: oof
[4:51:02] Braggardt: Susge
[4:51:08] Adders666: my Gw2 account got hacked and they cleaned me right out :(

[4:51:58] Syrjyys: The only time I've account shared was for a week when friend asked to do his Molten Front dailies while he was on vacation abroad
[4:51:58] Nokterian: I'm happy when 2 step verification came in back in 2008 with the physical authentication
[4:51:59] KelticNight: KEKW

[4:52:46] Braggardt: don't look at them with angor, it's not their fault!
[4:52:51] D3STRO_FTW: My discord got hacked last night
[4:52:56] ICitizenErasedI: @LasyPanda suoer against the TOS and his account would pretty much get banned straight away
[4:52:57] LasyPanda: @tailech No one would have known
[4:52:58] mkluvin1515: I think you got a pet and the authenticator was like $5 is that right @nupss
[4:52:59] Kingpin192: My account got hacked in TBC by a Chinese hacker or bot but it was surprisingly easy to get it back
[4:53:04] VipMalis: in TBC when blizzard was trying to use p2p for patches, some clever guys managed to inject a keloger in to a patch update  and a lot of accoutnts got hacked over night

[4:56:17] Braggardt: Probably need 2-4 events for it
[4:56:19] MadMike261: @Chaoyang399 there is a thing with streaming and korea. Twitch probably limiting bandwith there

[5:29:35] Zyrakel: banter
[5:29:37] alwiro: Sure but you√Ñre a bully
[5:29:43] TojoNozomi2716: Bullying is 1sided, it's banter when you reciprocate KEKW
[5:29:45] Yurian33: guys being guys with their friends
[5:29:45] Lithirrdys: its a very british thing to bully your mates in a loving way
[5:29:49] whiskeyjack03: if everybody gets their turn, is it bullying? KEKW
[5:30:16] BigstrongboiTV: KEKW

[5:30:46] Voltikun: Why is there no Wilhelm scream anymore? Are the alerts still broken?
[5:30:47] zenkodac: i m in a guild just like that, i like it, the more honest you're about your mistakes the less shit you get so it just promotes accountability
[5:30:48] sinclsw23: ah, spidders
[5:30:55] GrebboGaming: it's all bants and jokes
[5:30:57] SpiderXIV: wideVIBE
[5:31:00] BraetonGreswold: 100% bants
[5:31:05] anjilo: I know exactly what you mean as I had a TBC guild like it. Pure bants and laughter.

[5:31:42] Prycey: @kainekaiser food that you eat LUL
[5:31:43] Silverwards: @kainekaiser everyone else's. Most of our food is from abroad nowadays
[5:31:48] anjilo: When everyone stays on voice coms after the raid you are in a good guild.
[5:31:49] theDirtyon3: look at liquid and how they act tbh
[5:31:49] Tibbroar: @kainekaiser food is a pretty strong term
[5:31:51] VallanceHeals: I find that it's a very EU mentality. Progress + harsh banter is just our way of doing things.
[5:32:00] Yurian33: Toegrinder is a mage legend
[5:32:26] CoffeeASAP: Yeah Liquid always looks like they are having a blast much to a lot of viewers discontent lol
[5:32:45] GrebboGaming: you can see the diff in vibe/atmosphere when watching RWF
[5:32:52] zoopy_uk: racism? WoW? really?
[5:33:00] anjilo: that's also early internet too
[5:33:04] Sintry123: Bald Fat and Ugly sounds like my kind of place. I'm known as the scat man in my guild because someone told me they'd shit on my family and I just replied with "We're a scat family, I'd love that" and that was 1 hour into my first trial raid and we're HOF as well
[5:33:25] Hekethe: A slur in a non-racist way
[5:33:26] Traion: Was it you? Was it your Welsh jokes?
[5:33:32] DiddyDemon: We had someone like that lasted about 20min once they joined voice
[5:33:36] whiskeyjack03: roaming hordes of wow racists? KEKW
[5:33:46] Fenzha: we talking actual racism or making offensive jokes targetting certian places
[5:33:47] Lithirrdys: "oh, thats just how <person name> is just ignore him" nah fuck that mate bye
[5:33:50] Hupu_a: my guild has few of those kind of "banter" people who use bit too much close to the border jokes
[5:33:55] Massey590: Massey590 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 72 months! 72 months of shits and giggles! Have a good one mate!

[5:34:59] Mezegis_Yo: KEKW Û†ÄÄ
[5:35:10] Bladetykon: what is Loz doing now? @Preachlfw
[5:35:15] Hellnolf: I missed 1 raid reset in 3 months for our guilds Denathrius kill and they stopped raiding after killing it Madge
[5:35:20] Chewmii: xdd
[5:35:22] GrebboGaming: NotLikeThis
[5:35:23] theDirtyon3: xdd
[5:35:23] BasVanDerWerff: OOF

[5:35:25] LordRavenspire: AINTNOWAY still true
[5:35:26] MagmaScythe: DuckPuke
[5:35:28] IntLoss: kill the boss, disband the guild leave

[5:35:31] Lithirrdys: Al the fuck man, get a reclear team together Madge
[5:35:33] Tibbroar: Despairge
[5:35:34] Umseslad: SLG Despairge
[5:35:40] Hupu_a: Despairge
[5:35:44] Decadence001: SAME FOR ME Despairge
[5:35:57] Vio9: hard to try again after lightning in a bottle
[5:35:59] theDirtyon3: mine was Nzoth Sadge
[5:36:09] zenkodac: specially for someone like you who raided everything before at a cutting edge level its a shame that was the last one
[5:36:18] Dracold77: @Preachlfw To this day, can't tell you how much I relate - because the very same thing happened to me, couldn't be asked to reprog after that, overall SLG is my last myth kill to this day though :')
[5:36:20] Thefatkid145: mine was the dance boss in castle
[5:36:22] magisterofquelthalas: U have DF guild tho r?
[5:36:27] GoTeamAJ: 10.2 mythic has been fun first time playing mythic for me since Nyolotha
[5:36:28] Fenzha: I think theres spiders on the south of the zone past Stonard
[5:36:30] whiskeyjack03: if you're looking for a real challenge in heroic, i might know a guild or two KEKW
[5:36:33] CoffeeASAP: yeah we stopped at dance boss too
[5:37:09] Chewmii: Oldge
[5:37:19] Lithirrdys: SLG - broken boss broke so many guilds
[5:37:20] Silverwards: Zoomers kill guilds NOTED
[5:37:23] snuffles_80: Oh no not zoomers
[5:37:25] Umseslad: pgeBlind
[5:37:26] Fenzha: spider behind you
[5:37:27] Yurian33: world 20... could try harder
[5:37:31] VallanceHeals: @Preachlfw What's the funniest reason you've ever had to postpone a raid? I feel like every guild has at least one ridiculously hilarious postponement reason.
[5:37:34] Spira: ‚Äòold‚Äô
[5:37:34] CoffeeASAP: no whippersnappers Smadge
[5:37:35] GrebboGaming: honestly you see that so much in Mythic guilds nowadays
[5:37:36] soren111999: zoomers killed the guild industry Sadge
[5:37:37] SpiderXIV: think my guild stopped at heroic ner'zhul in SoD
[5:37:37] Traion: NOTED All Jordan's fault
[5:37:41] magisterofquelthalas: Zoomers are dangerous
[5:37:42] LasyPanda: Do guild Reunion raid @Preachlfw
[5:37:44] Dracold77: I even built an extra gear set to be as useful as possible for SLG specifically and then Denathrius...well, I got to warm the bench and guild disbanded right after kill xD
[5:37:45] KelticNight: Florida does
[5:37:51] theDirtyon3: too true its hard to kep up with the game as you get older
[5:37:56] GrebboGaming: those who really wanna push vs those who are fine just chillin and gamin
[5:37:58] OmegaSyntaX: Tis the way NODDERS
[5:38:04] Fenzha: along the mountain
[5:38:14] Umseslad: HOLY pgeBlind
[5:38:22] Bronloch: spiders are SW zone
[5:38:27] pieboy321: @Preachlfw are you going to try Ashes of Creation alpha test later this year?
[5:38:27] OmegaSyntaX: Ulti prog one day NODDERS
[5:38:29] Vareska11: they are in invis sometimes
[5:38:34] Lithirrdys: I was enhance up till denathrius then got asked to go resto for it. never played resto at point. ended up by the time we killed it I beat the resto main KEKW
[5:38:34] CoffeeASAP: @Preachlfw I've been watching a lot of your old videos on TDP and you seem a lot happier playing now
[5:38:41] LordRavenspire: @Preachlfw forgot to say - the GW2 raid team got Dhuum CM down last week
[5:38:44] IntLoss: there is always time for raiding just dont shower
[5:38:44] Mina_the_Engineer: pgeBlind old man vision
[5:38:45] theDirtyon3: Ashes is never coming NODDERS
[5:38:46] magisterofquelthalas: Yeah i mean ever since 25 i cant raid seriously
[5:38:47] Tibbroar: AoC will totally release guys dont worry COPIUM
[5:38:54] Human_r0bot: Mine doesn't allow for raiding either. But wow is honestly more fun without progression raiding
[5:38:54] Chewmii: widepeepoHappy
[5:38:58] Voltikun: Happy Mike is a good Mike
[5:39:05] thestew1337: ar u gonne raid gnomer?
[5:39:05] Nupss: widepeepoHappy fun
[5:39:20] Dracold77: @Preachlfw generally 14 is more manageable with less days, done 2 ultimates and 3 savage tiers (current) with 2 days a week, often even skipping days
[5:39:28] Lithirrdys: Imagine having a job that is fun Sadge
[5:39:28] soren111999: whats the best color spider? i think green
[5:39:29] DetorioxDesign: tbh would of never thought 4 years ago i woulda of ever seen u play ftl but here we are
[5:39:29] whiskeyjack03: your fresh account series back in legion is hands down the best wow content you've ever done. i'd love a 'season 2' of it @Preachlfw
[5:39:31] Human_r0bot: WOW OR RIOT
[5:39:32] mkluvin1515: Nah those days are long gone
[5:39:33] Skoragon: Variety is the spice of life
[5:39:35] blank452: Miles Happier - name of Mike's Bob Ross impression LUL
[5:39:36] aerthrall: more games= more fun
[5:39:39] piratecrabman: peepoRiot
[5:39:40] mobbeh: Hvae you considered doing something similar to what Jordan is doing with raiding one day per week on stream?
[5:39:40] echo319: Variety or RIOT
[5:39:46] Vertigo_GB: what most normal ppl do
[5:39:47] reckqqt: i feel like every tryhard aspect in wow is killing the fun, same with arena in retail @Preachlfw
[5:39:48] jack_0f_clubs: Hey thats what i did. play every class
[5:39:48] snuffles_80: No streamer i follow are one gamers

[5:40:07] Voltikun: @preachlfw I mean you could do all Pet Battle Quests to see what that's like
[5:40:11] Voltikun: KEKW
[5:40:14] redroniksre: I can only play one game for like a few days or a week max if i hardcore it
[5:40:22] KelticNight: stops being a game, starts being a job
[5:40:26] zenkodac: i dont get why people see that as bad, you shouldnt be playing the same game all the time, verity is the key to happiness
[5:40:30] Tetra85: MADGE
[5:40:33] Zirenai: didnt get that @Preachlfw are you planning on raiding in War Within? high level raiding with friends sounds like great stream content
[5:40:33] soren111999: Ians stress level must have dropped dramatically after you quit wow full time
[5:40:37] pinkcandytroll: @Preachlfw Has going to the gym on a regular helped with small annoying things like that?
[5:40:42] zenkodac: variety*
[5:40:43] thestew1337: @Preachlfw but ar u gonne try to raid gnomer?
[5:40:49] thestew1337: amazing raid
[5:40:49] mkluvin1515: SoD has been a fantastic casual classic wow experience
[5:40:56] Amyrantha_: It took me a while after you changed to variety streams, especially because you played a lot of FFXIV right after "leaving" and i was kind of frustrated because i loved seeing you play wow while i really didn't like FFXIV... But now like 2 (?) years later and having seen you play other games (that interest me more) im happy you're happy :)
[5:41:00] Vio9: gonna get Somnus'd Sure
[5:41:25] theDirtyon3: slow progress kills my soul
[5:41:26] Venkix: I feel like some FFXIV content creators had to learn the same with Endwalker's "content drought".
[5:41:26] Zirenai: @Preachlfw kk gotcha, didnt understand when u said someone was setting up a raid group
[5:41:27] IntLoss: just do LFR the best type of raiding
[5:41:45] Adders666: you should make a viewers guild @Preachlfw
[5:41:46] Tetra85: I‚Äôm getting hyped for EDF 6 in the spring
[5:41:53] countrycount: but crusher is bad tho ;P
[5:41:55] mkluvin1515: Retail raiding needs a reformatting
[5:42:01] whiskeyjack03: half-arsing mythic leads to 5 months of progress raiding
[5:42:08] cerolith: I imagine emma wouldn‚Äôt be happy @preachlfw
[5:42:15] GrebboGaming: 2024 lives are not conducive to 20-man mythic raiding
[5:42:27] corax7491: @preachlfw How is your day going Preach?
[5:42:33] turtleandfish: having watched your channel consistently since wod, i really enjoy the variety stuff that you played ever since then @Preachlfw
[5:42:49] theicon1681: Zepla? The Genshin Impact streamer?
[5:43:07] Amyrantha_: yes, 100%
[5:43:19] Kichiro42: Zeplas Feedback was kinda good, but the title was clickbait af
[5:43:26] Tetra85: @turtleandfish Ty for the gift sub the other day!
[5:43:33] turtleandfish: @Tetra85 <3
[5:43:47] theicon1681: @kichiro224 that's how YT is these days, clickbait for DAYS
[5:43:48] TojoNozomi2716: Locking yourself to one game is bad for your own mental
[5:43:50] CoffeeASAP: if it had more cool open world content like GW2, WoW would feel so much better to no-life
[5:43:52] boomkinburger: I gotta say, I'm really enjoying these shooting the shit story time streams a lot.
[5:43:54] Tetra85: <3
[5:44:01] Lithirrdys: thats why I didnt come back for DF. too much change, cba to learn the game again
[5:44:04] Jimmeh89: love this song btw
[5:44:09] GrebboGaming: WoW patches have a lifespan of like, 2 months right now. after that there's a huge dropoff it feels like
[5:44:23] VallanceHeals: @Preachlfw Personally, I've gained a lot from raiding recently. Since joining your blind raid in GW2, I've joined the Crawlers, cleared every raid and strike (apart from HTCM), and branched into FF14 Savage (P12S kill soon COPIUM ). So honestly, thanks Mike for introducing me to raiding properly because it's now my favourite thing to do in games. <3
[5:44:30] mkluvin1515: Clickbait titles are just marketing
[5:44:32] Peacemillian: Sure
[5:44:35] Phabey: last week I unsubbed from FF for the first time since I started playing ~4 years ago. I was basically logging on out of routine. Happy to just go and do other shit until DT
[5:44:37] fibriz1: i have a extension that blocks clickbait on youtube and never been happier
[5:44:39] IntLoss: there is such a thing as anti-clickbait where it is so boring that it stands out
[5:44:47] zenkodac: GrebboGaming that sounds like a healthy amount to play wow at a time with brakes in between
[5:44:47] whiskeyjack03: i remember TB protesting the clickbait trend by naming his videos like "i will now talk about X for 35 minutes" LUL
[5:44:49] Neverlast: "A in depth look at WoW's raiding" isn't as catchy as "YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS CRAZY WOW RAIDING STORY"
[5:44:53] Bronloch: dooo dooooo dooooo
[5:44:55] DasFlume: The Children of Bodom cover of this song is fire
[5:44:56] Streamlabs: üê≤ Check out our new Dragonflight merch in metal band live tour style! https://preachgaming.com/shop/ üê≤
[5:45:06] Venkix: true LUL
[5:45:08] Kichiro42: @kichiro224 it made a different impression from what she said in the video and part of the community dislike her now for that and other things.
[5:45:09] Minion3309: I need BG3 dlc
[5:45:09] VallanceHeals: There is far too much content, indeed!
[5:45:10] Tetra85: where can I fit this pineapple!?!?
[5:45:12] kainekaiser: Shruge just don't play anything
[5:45:19] redroniksre: I can only balance 3 right now, WoW, FFXIV and ESO
[5:45:20] VallanceHeals: But never enough GW2 content, at least.
[5:45:23] GrebboGaming: @zenkodac i agree i just mean in regards to how much people are playin retail over a period of time
[5:45:36] Neverlast: "And as you can see this is why MoP was Objectively the most subjectively best"
[5:45:49] valianya: @preachlfw  do you care about the lore in retail at all?  What's your opinion on Dragonflight story quests and little in-game cutscenes?
[5:45:51] Venkix: Any plans on checking out Last Epoch 1.0?
[5:45:51] scrubbybubbles42: gokufan i member
[5:45:58] cythis_91: I get WoW is a gear base game, but would really like more causal progress or cosmetics like in FF14. We need housing peepoRiot XD
[5:45:59] whiskeyjack03: would it have even mattered? KEKW
[5:46:29] Valres: do you still remember every agonizing second of the raids gokufan was in? Kappa
[5:46:29] Nupss: they revelled in being a good enough guild to be desired, as long as you could eat shit
[5:46:31] turtleandfish: oh yeah speaking of wow community, did you see that Varya is back as the EU CM? @Preachlfw
[5:46:40] GrebboGaming: who was the MT of KCL? that like godmode warrior?

[5:59:48] Monstot: catJAM
[5:59:50] Philbobaggins12: Cheer100 Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.

[6:02:09] Minion3309: Cheer100 While most spiders are solitary animals, there are some that form communities building large communal cobwebs. Colonies can number in the thousands of individuals and they will work together to incapacitate prey trapped in their webs and share the harvest with each other.
