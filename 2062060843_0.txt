[10:15:53] stinkychair: the little eye of kilrogg that could
[10:16:14] Rakschas: melee hunter is good but give this season two weeks and everyone will have caught up. no way hunter scales as well as the casters like sp and wl that are already showing on warcraftlogs
[10:17:09] Rakschas: No warrior Ive met had the Uldaman 4.0 AS axe. Hard to compare them really to their full potential.
[10:17:09] BingoTingler: I think they will nerf melee hunter and shadow word death and warlocks will be #1 dps this phase
[10:17:30] Rakschas: Nail that stands out and all that
[10:17:45] Rakschas: I loved melee hunter as a scuffed 2h spec with trap launcher.

[10:19:18] islesshadow: let me look for it
[10:19:18] Sims_10: i hope the two melee hunter runes get swapped where the damage boost is on melee spec and the reset is on dw spec so weaving is a thing
[10:19:22] stinkychair: that druid has been on that boat for days
