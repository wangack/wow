[3:49:45] Oohgod2: it's more nuanced than that, warriors don't need hamstring in pve, rogues may not need evasion in pve, so you can get more power in pve giving up evasion or more power in pvp in exchange for some dps in
[3:49:47] Littlehoodie16: swifty do you still plan to play wrath when dragonflight releases?
