[0:07:06] Harai_Ulfsark: dont be like that, i even liked the nzoth patch on bfa LUL
[0:07:08] FelPlague: @therealnzoth felplaPoint Hello you, when are you going to reward us for keeping your eye on our head all these years?
[0:07:13] magisterofquelthalas: I think we like SoD. I seem to value trying new things in games more than anything

[0:11:55] Triskelian: Wrong SOD @thunduz  :D
[0:12:04] thunduz: @Triskelian or so you think
[0:12:20] Harai_Ulfsark: you'll farm shards of domination for eternity
[0:12:23] thunduz: tneKhadgarWut
[0:14:27] ancester: no we dont
[0:17:05] Togglegoggle: I like SoD but wished they took more risks with more classes/specs. The actually new stuff is fun (mage healer/warlock tank/etc) but a lot of it just seems to be porting retail abilities back to old classes.
[0:24:12] Altrosek: there’s something about this intro music that calms my nerves
[0:24:32] Triskelian: Is it just me or is Tali taking an extra long poo today?
[0:25:26] XedL: He has to be more careful since bringing the ceiling down
[0:25:38] Triskelian: Good point
[0:26:03] bettys_dungeon_adventures: is that what happened?
[0:26:22] bettys_dungeon_adventures: must be strong poos those

[0:26:33] Triskelian: It's as good a theory as any :D
[0:27:05] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i thought evi just punched him through the ceiling after an argument
[0:27:36] MrScotticus: Happy Tuesday!
[0:27:43] HSAyril: I bet he was just sitting there watching us
[0:27:45] thunduz: No poo?!
[0:27:49] HSAyril: Menacingly
[0:27:52] bettys_dungeon_adventures: ah so evi DID punch him through the ceiling
[0:28:02] FelPlague:

[0:28:41] Fibnkak: on a positive note when you have the guys in to fix up your kitchen you can have them patch your ceiling
[0:28:41] rowanoaken: The music and the graphic are such a wonderful combination <3
[0:28:47] grimblymcgoo: @Togglegoggle The game is 20 years old. What brand new stuff that you havent seen in retail do you think will show up?
[0:28:48] FelPlague: @bettys_dungeon_adventures I know, Sylvanas banned from future D&D sessions.
[0:29:23] HSAyril: Chatting with music before the stream is kinda neat
[0:29:32] thunduz: valid
[0:29:36] bettys_dungeon_adventures: is it a humidity issue maybe? i had to get a dehumidifier after my curtains popped off my walls in one room.
[0:29:37] Fibnkak: yea replacing plated and forks seems like a good idea
[0:29:40] HolocronCoder: Is that why there's no poo? You shit on the kitchen floor, Tali?
[0:29:44] hulksmash81: agreed
[0:29:45] revan4686: hay @taliesinandevitel made up we got a stream while I am watching the Warcraft film in work best work day ever

[0:31:39] Fibnkak: voice
[0:31:39] FelPlague: Seems fine to me.
[0:31:41] XedL: Seems fine to me, although the framerate looks bit weird on the camera
[0:31:45] FelPlague: Clap check!
[0:31:46] Smef42: Voice is slightly ahead. Framerate seems low
[0:31:49] bettys_dungeon_adventures: seems fine to me too
[0:31:51] mantooth11: it's synced perfect for me
[0:31:54] LilyOfTremere: To me it all just looks a little laggy :o
[0:31:58] shadowsliver24: maybe reinitialize your camera, it seems slightly laggy
[0:32:14] Smef42: The video stream framerate of the camera and game are both low
[0:32:15] AndreMSAL: framerate is odd even in you cam.
[0:32:17] alextheblight: it's whatever, it's barely noticable
[0:32:18] LilyOfTremere: Webbie looks grainy too
[0:32:21] Fibnkak: my recent amd update has screwed up my fps recently
[0:32:25] FelPlague: Yeah even cam is odd
[0:32:26] alextheblight: noticeable, even
[0:32:30] XedL: Seems a bit low on the camera stream too - was it confused be the dark start?

[0:33:56] sapphire_rosa_: tali can I ask
[0:33:58] tandemshoehorns: Just leave it, it's like watching a dubbed film.
[0:34:04] Fibnkak: I updated to the 2-19 and it messed up my fps
[0:34:11] sapphire_rosa_: how do you manage to stop the stream pixelating when movement is happening
[0:34:12] alextheblight: full movie of Nimona is out for free on netflix's youtube channel, by the way
[0:34:15] XedL: That would mean being able to get into Helldivers
[0:34:20] sapphire_rosa_: because I don’t know how to prevent it and yours is so crisp

[0:37:20] Gh0stBadger: OBs i belleive
[0:37:21] SerThunderbeans: V-sync is completely redundant for most monitors nowadays
[0:37:36] SerThunderbeans: you can turn it off on the driver level too, that will force it off
[0:37:47] sapphire_rosa_: awesome thank you so very much everyone! my streams are amazing with new PC but I have noticed this annoying pixelation issue
[0:37:54] Fibnkak: @FelPlague oh yea that feels future toxic i will pass

[0:40:35] HSAyril: I wonder what the difference is if you didn't change anything from yeaterday. I love how things just change when you didn't change any settings
[0:40:36] shadowsliver24: I've been having lagg issues in wow lately with antialising, disabling it ingame gave me 20 more fps and the render scale tricks slow my pc down as well
[0:40:44] thunduz: Whoa is this what gaming is like in the future?! With Vert sync off it's like I really am on the dragon isles
[0:41:00] grimblymcgoo: @obizdub How many ducks have you been killing? That's like 1% of mobs in df

[0:47:33] sapphire_rosa_: @meggoart MOOD XDDD
[0:47:33] SerThunderbeans: I started somewhat recently on SoD as well FeelsGoodMan Got a rogue and mage up to lvl 20-ish, pally at 15... I felt the need to poke around and get a few runes on each before deciding what I really wanna play...
[0:47:37] seanstrachan: Link*
[0:47:39] Arlaeya: Yes thank you for playing s I don't have to create yet another toon just for lore-ness
[0:47:39] spenseb: if they were, is that better or worse than story being in “outside media”
[0:47:42] thunduz: @MeggoArt tneEvi  saying what we all feel
[0:48:06] cabeshpash: lol why don't you want to play it?
[0:48:29] Gh0stBadger: yeah my friend always nags me trying to get me to get on SOD, i dont like the old grindy gameplay anymore
[0:48:38] FelPlague: Big issue is it is still just classic wow, there is new stuff, but it is just classic wow
[0:48:44] FelPlague: and the grind to 40 is still a lot of work
[0:48:53] Harai_Ulfsark: no aoe loot :(
[0:48:56] cabeshpash: there so many quality of life improvements that have been made in the game since, it's really hard for me to go back the classic feel
[0:48:57] thunduz: I am so glad to know I'm not alone in geeking out for classic
[0:49:03] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: As my friend in Edinburgh says, "you can't be arsed."
[0:49:05] thunduz: not geeking out*
[0:49:08] jaedd3680: I did the exact same thing
[0:49:12] SquiggySquonk: As someone that was initially excited for classic, I totally get it. I just don’t want to play it.
[0:49:15] Gh0stBadger: to many quality of life changes have happened that im used to now, to hard to go back lol
[0:49:18] runehako: it happens.
[0:49:20] Midgens_: I understand that feeling
[0:49:24] Xephur123: Same Tallie!
[0:49:24] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[0:49:27] Togglegoggle: i'm with you. i've been trying to force myself to level a warlock but it's tough.
[0:49:56] rowanoaken: I've been pugging +18s and... ugh... I have to prepare myself for pricks and it's so exhausting
[0:50:05] Dazzaw17: i did the same, logged in, made a hunter, got to level 3 and logged bac kinto retail LUL
[0:50:14] dright424: Modern WoW just feels so much nicer to me its really hard to go and play a classic version even with the changes
[0:50:14] merzicdh: classic wow/sod is way to slow combat for me. i can't be bothered to even try
[0:50:20] sapphire_rosa_: I am trying to get KSM for the first time ever this season
[0:50:26] butlerlog: You'd be playing maybe 100 hours of something you don't want to play to see two character conversations that aren't more than a marvel post credit ad
[0:50:29] Dazzaw17: I played wow in vanilla and i just prefer retail now
[0:50:33] thunduz: Tali did you get a haircut or is it just resting perfectly?
[0:50:37] brennibrennt: For me it's the same reason why I didn't play Classic, I played it already 20 years ago and I won't play it jsut because they tacked a few new bits on it that might be relevant for the story in the actual modern game.
[0:50:52] Eredith: when did you start playing wow?
[0:50:55] FelPlague: I sent you the footage already Tali!
[0:51:05] kwazyk: kwazyk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 18 month streak! I was the same way.  I did it all back in vanilla and now time spent leveling in a game I already did ain’t entertaining.
[0:51:10] databob1: I just got BG3  I don't know when I'm gonna play anything else
[0:51:10] magisterofquelthalas: There isnt THAT much changed
[0:51:13] thunduz: @FelPlague such a legend
[0:51:23] magisterofquelthalas: There are additions
[0:51:27] Gh0stBadger: i started mid TBC
[0:51:32] Eredith: oh great place to start though 😁
[0:51:40] cabeshpash: man those were such different times lol
[0:51:42] butlerlog: i respect that, but it is a lot to do. i have been loving SoD, but getting to 40 was no joke
[0:51:43] cabeshpash: makes me feel old
[0:51:43] merzicdh: @Eredith i started in the second half of vanilla and i have no desire to play that again
[0:51:48] jaedd3680: My problem was I don't feel connected to any of the horde race choices, but I wanted to play horde because I've played the starting alliance areas too much... so I didn't even get past the character creation lol
[0:52:08] rowanoaken: I watched my dad play WoW since I was three, and could only start playing myself in WoD :')
[0:52:26] Eredith: @merzicdh understandable 😅
[0:52:30] thunduz: I was on a plane leaving DC at that point, had to get Mrs back for some college classes. But was cool to be there at that time lol
[0:52:31] SerThunderbeans: Hah, I'm Tali's senior in WoW EZ TeaTime I hit 70 in TBC the day before WotLK launched
[0:52:34] Gh0stBadger: playing classic with the AI voice addon is kinda neat
[0:52:34] grimblymcgoo: Its the same game. And the same leveling experience. Its just so hard to do it again after so many years. But agree that SoD is great for the game
[0:52:47] cabeshpash: yeah most of the draw is nostalgia, so if you didn't play vanilla it makes sense
[0:53:15] knightjudicator: i get a weird tingling in my brain of recognition when I play classic, but i get the same when I play old world in Retail
[0:53:19] TheCozyDruid: I've been getting into SoD but I still prefer retail
[0:53:21] RoboticUnicorn007: Been playing since the Open & Closed Beta for Vanilla WoW
[0:53:26] thunduz: I didn't hit Max in vanilla but made it in TBC and remember grinding sunwell to get enough gold for flying
[0:53:28] rowanoaken: I know my dad always said the main appeal of Vanilla was the levelling, so I kind of want to experience that gameplay style
[0:53:29] Gh0stBadger: yeah some of the long quest chains that have been removed
[0:53:35] spooky_seraph: I started early Vanilla, loved it so much, but I can't find the energy to play that way again tbh
[0:53:52] MeggoArt: honestly i was not interested in classic at all BUT i did like my one run of hardcore because it added a new element to the mix
[0:54:06] Gh0stBadger: i played classic TBC and some of wrath, so im done with it now haha
[0:54:08] rowanoaken: Ugh the amount of people who have flamed the healer because of that DoT...
[0:54:16] SerThunderbeans: I've been using SoD as a means to experience old alliance content, since I was a die-hard hordie for so long! FeelsGoodMan It's pretty great for that!
[0:54:16] jaedd3680: jaedd3680 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:54:18] thunduz: Tali what is the lore connection between Dark Heart Thicket and the Dark Heart update on the roadmap?
[0:54:18] jandemain: 5-10
[0:54:29] Blighthung: TALIESIN, you are so fricking AMAZING.
[0:54:32] butlerlog: its hard to say why i love the leveling. classic has so many flaws that retail has fixed, yet somehow despite thinking i would hate classic, i absolutely love it.
[0:54:37] HSAyril: No, sounds like a healer mechanic
[0:55:16] shadowsliver24: Waycrest manor, just do a radience right before the dot and defensive penance the person who gets it.
[0:55:25] cabeshpash: does 3k give you any rewards?
[0:55:33] rowanoaken: I like the pink colour that 3k *** gives your number - I think it's pretty
[0:55:39] Gh0stBadger: LUL
[0:55:39] cabeshpash: Lol
[0:55:41] TheCozyDruid: aimeesLUL
[0:55:43] cabeshpash: the best reward
[0:55:46] HSAyril: Lmao
[0:55:59] Gh0stBadger: gh0stb9Ohmy
[0:56:13] Xephur123: Good job Evi loves you for the way you use it tneEvi tneEviHeart
[0:56:14] thunduz: really?! It does?! Can I join the group...
[0:56:19] Blighthung: Take people that knows how to kick and you good.
[0:56:30] knightjudicator: @Xephur123 LMFAOOOO
[0:56:37] rowanoaken: OH SHIT JESUS
[0:56:56] sapphire_rosa_: i kind of want to come but i am BAD
[0:57:05] rowanoaken: No I am so scared tali
[0:57:08] Dazzaw17: the dps pugging experience is just applying to groups, waiting to be declined then applying to more and on and on NotLikeThis
[0:57:12] rainman444444: bubble FTW
[0:57:14] rowanoaken: I'm the pally please oh god... my anxiety lol
[0:57:20] SerThunderbeans: What lvl key was it?
[0:57:28] knightjudicator: @SerThunderbeans 22
[0:57:32] crumbler81: what's a rating?
[0:57:42] sapphire_rosa_: OH NO ABSOLUTELY NOT
[0:57:43] SerThunderbeans: I'm down to DPS on my pally
[0:57:44] Sorin__: At least if it all goes wrong they can blame it on streamer
[0:57:48] sapphire_rosa_: i have only done 18s
[0:57:56] SerThunderbeans: 483 pally, Nirthés-TarrenMill, logging on
[0:58:00] shadowsliver24: 3 paladins XD
[0:58:04] rowanoaken: Oh for the meme
[0:58:07] cabeshpash: might as well go 5 pallys
[0:58:07] HSAyril: 2,500 but on US server :sadge:
[0:58:09] SilverkissTwitch: Get a pally tank too
[0:58:09] SerThunderbeans: I see no problem
[0:58:12] thunduz: Tali are you going to check out Skull and Bones?
[0:58:15] HolocronCoder: Now to find a Pally tank
[0:58:15] Gh0stBadger: then a pally tank will join
[0:58:15] rowanoaken: And I'll be the worst out of all the pallys
[0:58:21] plopsmurf: PALA TANK PogChamp
[0:58:22] thunduz: its AAAA game
[0:58:25] Blighthung: You got this Talie.
[0:58:26] Arlaeya: BRH... no one told me about the rocks getting buffed. I'm so bad at M+ lol
[0:58:33] cabeshpash: use your storm pally LUL
[0:58:52] rowanoaken: The content of me fucking up over and over again will be worth it lol
[0:58:55] witcherpie: boromir here, i will ruin it as a tank,but im down for it
[0:59:13] caradosailanthus: Last night only a few hours before reset, I got repeatedly declined to tank +9s on my 458ilvl 4-piece warrior tank.  It was freaking hilarious how elitist some folks can be.
[0:59:15] thunduz: tneEvi
[0:59:37] SerThunderbeans: Huh, I can't see it on the finder on Tarren Mill EU, I'll bring my mage on AD instead
[0:59:55] thunduz: if we all shout gary at the same time maybe we can summon him. Like the WoW horn in that commercial
[1:00:09] thunduz: GARY!!!!
[1:00:20] SerThunderbeans: Yeah, you can take the warr if you like, not working for me
[1:00:23] Triskelian: GARY!!!
[1:00:30] sapphire_rosa_: i will be doing somewhat lower keys later with friends lmao
[1:00:43] sapphire_rosa_: a 23 is utterly terrifying to me
[1:00:59] Engram08: ty
[1:01:03] plopsmurf: @caradosailanthus There are higher people applying, not elitist persee
[1:01:10] SerThunderbeans: Not showing up on my finder D:
[1:01:14] sapphire_rosa_: i'm still learning to do endgame content after years of not <3
[1:01:16] butlerlog: @sapphire_rosa_ mood
[1:01:17] SerThunderbeans: Take the giga warr
[1:01:20] SerThunderbeans: I'll join the next one <3
[1:01:30] magisterofquelthalas: Tali, can u recommend a class/spec for a first time healer? @taliesinandevitel
[1:01:30] REDSUNDERGROUND: easy to get into keys as a prot warrior just have to get io to at  least 2.8k as dps  before you can start tanking though XD
[1:01:42] TheCozyDruid: Have fun LUL
[1:01:44] RileyDoodles_: evening all
[1:01:46] rowanoaken: My palms are so sweaty rn jesus
[1:01:56] TheCozyDruid: I heal for 4 melee in my group and it's so fun
[1:01:58] knightjudicator: @magisterofquelthalas depends how you want to heal and what you want as offspecs
[1:02:00] jandemain: mistweaver is loads of fun right now
[1:02:02] Gh0stBadger: i main holy right now
[1:02:07] Gh0stBadger: i dabble in disc sometimes
[1:02:11] sapphire_rosa_: World's Worst Druid running away from M+ as fast as my little catraptor legs can carry me
[1:02:15] sapphire_rosa_: HAI COZY
[1:02:15] AlanC2024: top tip don't heal a melee grp in darkheart thicket. Last boss is a pain
[1:02:17] caradosailanthus: @plopsmurf Nope they were sitting there with no tank, no healer for a good bit after declining me.  It was being elitist.
[1:02:33] TheCozyDruid: @sapphire_rosa_ sapphi212Rave
[1:02:36] butlerlog: you cast heals and their hp goes up, its great
[1:02:47] sapphire_rosa_: @TheCozyDruid sapphi212Hypehype sapphi212Hypehype
[1:02:47] GardenVarietyNecromancer: I find druid to be harder actually.  You gotta pre-heal if you don't know what you're doing and you can mess up your HoT timings.
[1:03:13] rilozeta: isn't resto shaman considered easy
[1:03:19] RileyDoodles_: i loveee atal dazar tbh
[1:03:25] rowanoaken: Omg thank you lovely :')
[1:03:26] T1TANZ_78: resto shaman is easiest.  they excel at reactive healing
[1:03:26] GardenVarietyNecromancer: HPal is the easiest healer in my opinion.
[1:03:34] Xephur123: 2 palas means you may be boping through tneMovEEE
[1:03:39] TheCozyDruid: I'm still so happy they brought Waycrest Manor to this season
[1:03:51] shadowsliver24: Industrial metal
[1:04:00] butlerlog: oh man i am about to watch tali actually play the game i am excited
[1:04:05] kwazyk: polka!!
[1:04:08] netonkent: New yay album haha
[1:04:11] Shirey12: waiting for the US realms to come up so I can open 10 vaults lol
[1:04:14] Dazzaw17: @shadowsliver24 if only LUL
[1:04:19] rilozeta: I hope we get more legion dungeons best season.  Legion has my favorite dungeons for some reason
[1:04:21] Blighthung: Music is the real key of success.
[1:04:30] rilozeta: next season*
[1:04:44] jawea: tneKhadgarWut
[1:04:49] Miiskuneiti: reactive healers are easiest to learn, you heal after damage happens
[1:04:51] kwazyk: well polka was close!
[1:04:52] HSAyril: It's so good
[1:04:59] rowanoaken: Good motivational bop
[1:05:04] TheCozyDruid: clodagWiggle
[1:05:07] RileyDoodles_: space banjo, id expect nothing less
[1:05:16] SamuraiWillZ916: woot wooot sod
[1:05:20] BlindseerJB: Space Banjo?? EXPLAIN!!
[1:05:24] T1TANZ_78: @TaliesinAndEvitel what was the name of the artist and song that "inspired" the T&E theme?
[1:05:24] TheCozyDruid: I'd never thought I'd hear space and banjo in the same sentence
[1:05:27] butlerlog: butlerlog subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! bloop
[1:05:41] sapphire_rosa_: @TheCozyDruid me neither but you know what ..... it kind of works
[1:05:41] shadowsliver24: The opposite of earth Banjo
[1:05:46] thunduz: Cheer100 give em some sugar, bois!
[1:05:48] BlindseerJB: But where can I find such a wonderous sound??
[1:05:55] RileyDoodles_: boomkin banjo
[1:06:08] HolocronCoder: I just hear the banjo, not so much the space
[1:06:12] sapphire_rosa_: @shadowsliver24 can earth banjo defeat space banjo is the important question here
[1:06:33] T1TANZ_78: they really can blame the healer in this dungeon
[1:06:37] shadowsliver24: Only with the assistance from the necromancers from Alpha Centauri
[1:06:45] sapphire_rosa_: @shadowsliver24 makes sense
[1:07:01] Gh0stBadger: LUL
[1:07:02] AlanC2024: i seen a hunter doing a million the other day. wild
[1:07:08] danno_ok: we blame space banjo
[1:07:11] sapphire_rosa_: clodagHeheheh
[1:07:16] T1TANZ_78: tali trying hard mode M20s lol
[1:07:25] thunduz: Cheer100 That half inch is almost guaranteed at this point
[1:07:36] Gh0stBadger: actually digging space banjo
[1:07:38] lfvre: what is SoD system of a down ?
[1:07:43] thunduz: sure do LOL
[1:07:45] sapphire_rosa_: @danno_ok earth banjo may be able to defeat space banjo BUT space banjo can clearly defeat Tali
[1:07:48] butlerlog: lmao
[1:07:55] shadowsliver24: @lfvre Season of Discovery
[1:07:59] HSAyril: I've had a guild member drop an anvil into the Gbank so we could pull it out in the middle of a M+ run and repair lmao
[1:08:01] Gh0stBadger: *goes to find some space banjo*
[1:08:11] sapphire_rosa_: @lfvre both probably have Toxicity XDDDDDDDDDDD
[1:08:11] thunduz: such a mic drop moment honestly
[1:08:11] knightjudicator: me when i take one weapon off to RP walk
[1:08:14] Pannekaker: That was a good time!
[1:08:23] Eredith: it just speaks to your skill 🤪
[1:08:24] revan4686: it’s good
[1:08:24] lfvre: @shadowsliver24 oh yeah ty
[1:08:28] NeeK_23: I healed a 17 with my stormwind teleport cloak equipped, was interesting
[1:08:31] knightjudicator: i once went the better part of a week without a weapon on because i was only doing overworld weeklies
[1:08:44] SamuraiWillZ916: lol made a new challenge mode
[1:08:50] RileyDoodles_: @NeeK_23 i go into m+ with my stormwind cloak far too often lmaoo
[1:08:53] Gh0stBadger: the classic wow experience wiuthout being in classic
[1:08:53] T1TANZ_78: looks like when i join an Oceanic group being in NA
[1:09:06] thunduz: Don't mind the frame rate, I am more angry no yellow submarine ping
[1:09:12] KaisenSiru: anniesRIP
[1:09:25] shadowsliver24: Professional streamer, now we know where all our patreon coins are going towards, the roof LuL
[1:09:36] NeeK_23: is the PC dying? whats the FPS issue?
[1:10:01] sapphire_rosa_: @NeeK_23 he said he thinks it's OBS ?
[1:10:06] sapphire_rosa_: also hi Neek
[1:10:07] thunduz: @NeeK_23 just wanted the classic feel in retail is all
[1:10:14] crumbler81: the classic wow experience comes to retail Pog
[1:10:27] Triskelian: "FPS rate" = Streamer Affix :D
[1:10:29] NeeK_23: NeeK_23 gifted a Tier 1 sub to sapphire_rosa_! They have given 19 Gift Subs in the channel!

[1:12:40] Montbivault: Hi cpcCheerz
[1:12:42] s7wede: If you ever have to heal a DK in anything under a 24, they are bad
[1:12:59] T1TANZ_78: !followage
[1:13:00] NeeK_23: just keep your health higher than your FPS and you're fine
[1:13:15] witcherpie: how many fps is this? 10? KEKW
[1:13:36] Gh0stBadger: framte = power point
[1:13:38] sapphire_rosa_: @NeeK_23 not saying much right now LMAO ( i understand the pain from the Time Before the PC)
[1:13:40] T1TANZ_78: this is the real SOD experience...
[1:13:44] placeholdername33: placeholdername33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:13:52] lumaday: Whats WoW without a bit of fps issues
[1:14:07] Yenma57: Hello, what is your nameplate addon?
[1:14:33] AlanC2024: dk's can be scary to heal
[1:14:34] thunduz: How are you playing WoW if servers are down? Streamer privilege
[1:14:38] butlerlog: i do like how your nameplate names are simplified
[1:14:55] Atomicpanda: many boppin's died to bring us this rating
[1:15:11] Bambiprsi: its not fps issues, its native streamer affix
[1:15:12] AlanC2024: i use kui nameplates, simpler but i have also used plater
[1:15:21] Blighthung: Quazii platter is just amazing.
[1:15:28] T1TANZ_78: ya know actually the banjo fits the low fps gameplay perfectly
[1:15:50] Gh0stBadger: i dig the space banjo a lot actually
[1:16:47] Anelit21: Have you ever played fighting games on arcade Tali?
[1:16:53] s7wede: @TaliesinAndEvitel For the soulbound goliath, the DK will probably try and delay using the fire till he has at least 24-25 stacks so watch out for then
[1:17:01] Discordant_Hats: Discordant_Hats subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Goddamn, season of discovery nails the classic feel, they've perfectly replicated the framerate of trying to play WoW for the first time on a budget laptop. ...Oh, this is retail. :p
[1:17:29] Pannekaker: Think I agree with that, though I did enjoy it back in BfA as well
[1:17:30] Tolz47: Do you think season 4 dungeon pool will be all DF dungeons?
[1:18:00] Gh0stBadger: dang i want to get good at disc
[1:18:09] rainman444444: worms
[1:18:11] NeeK_23: i hope Dawn isnt included again, kinda done with them now, could use a break
[1:18:16] lumaday: the maggots spawn twice is all
[1:18:18] witcherpie: tali when are we getting shadowlands dung in a season? i loved all of em so much peepoSad
[1:18:20] darkscythe_123: think they should do brd and upper and lower from classic as m+
[1:18:34] kwazyk: I will admit that I have been losing interest in WoW these days.  I even pulled out my old Eve Online account..  Baldurs Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 opened my eyes to new game level content.
[1:18:37] rws26: Is it just me or are all 8 original Dragonflight dungeons boring?
[1:18:58] darkscythe_123: they are
[1:19:07] darkscythe_123: no skill needed
[1:19:19] randsam2002: are you playing without your video card ?
[1:19:21] darkscythe_123: just pull to first boss kill
[1:19:22] Deatheran: mmmm there is some skill in them but its not required
[1:19:26] NeeK_23: Algathar is fun and Brackenhide
[1:19:30] knightjudicator: @kwazyk i think its a good thing to rotate out of games for a bit. DF is my fave expansion because i dont feel forced to play at all
[1:19:36] Deatheran: azure vaults had some cool stuff in it
[1:19:39] T1TANZ_78: just take freehold out of rotation FOREVER and i'll be happy
[1:19:41] Thuretical: rise
[1:19:42] NeeK_23: Atal last boss
[1:19:43] s7wede: AD
[1:19:43] lumaday: Everbloom
[1:19:47] HSAyril: Last boss ToT
[1:19:50] Nexusshade: Rice or atal
[1:19:50] Atomicpanda: i don't know ihaven't done all the df dungeons yet.
[1:19:57] mantooth11: tyrannical yazma is a pug killer
[1:19:58] Brandishblade: I need a ranger to only look cool on my warband screen. Void elf or night elf u think?
[1:20:01] witcherpie: second bosses everbloom lol
[1:20:02] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel hot take, the faction boss in rise
[1:20:04] Pannekaker: Oh my gods yeah, hate that
[1:20:12] lumaday: Everbloom last 3 bosses are rough on Tyrannical
[1:20:12] NeeK_23: first EB boss is easy, just takes an age
[1:20:20] Blighthung: Atal last boss should be the one to watch out.
[1:20:28] Harai_Ulfsark: yazma from atal, earthspeaker from tott, battlefield on murozond's rise
[1:20:30] NeeK_23: 10.2.5 increased mana costs for alot of healers
[1:20:31] Atomicpanda: so casual i've gotten exactly one item from the vault the whole expansion.
[1:20:33] T1TANZ_78: i STILL can't see the morchie with blue hair after this entire season
[1:21:24] Harai_Ulfsark: i hate that ONE DRAGON skip
[1:21:36] SilverkissTwitch: Saaaame
[1:21:44] witcherpie: @TaliesinAndEvitel did you like the shadowlands dungeons? when we getting em in a season rotation? ApuApustaja
[1:21:53] dastago: i hate that but because i'm always the one to fuck it up and that's embarassing
[1:21:54] Atomicpanda: now i need an alt named skip
[1:21:58] Discordant_Hats: Darkheart thicket still gives me ptsd from being the quickest legion dungeon to run for hidden artifact appearances. I can't go back there man.
[1:22:07] Harai_Ulfsark: @Atomicpanda make it a rogue
[1:22:11] NeeK_23: cant wait for Halls of Atonment to come back
[1:22:35] Quachiri: I missed it if he said it, is there a reason his fps is so low for the stream or is just the dungeon itself?
[1:22:38] Atomicpanda: exactly
[1:22:54] Nexusshade: do we know next season dungeons?
[1:23:04] NeeK_23: @Nexusshade all DF dungeons
[1:23:11] Nexusshade: aaah
[1:23:15] Nexusshade: thank you NeeK_23
[1:23:34] Atomicpanda: boss looks like me
[1:23:38] Thuretical: Quazii Wow has a great YouTube video about maximising your FPS
[1:24:04] Harai_Ulfsark: paladins tanking your frames tbh
[1:24:10] Nayruna: Space banjo is very Outer Wilds if you've played that, v nice and chill
[1:24:15] Atomicpanda: repair? oof
[1:24:16] SerThunderbeans: @Thuretical Yeah, his setup is hella good, this is some freak bug on his drivers or OBS going down rn
[1:24:24] SilverkissTwitch: It's okay the DK can solo it moonwa2Dalt
[1:24:32] thunduz: perfection
[1:24:34] Tolz47: Looks like it lol
[1:24:43] kwazyk: Question for Tali::  Do you think that games that do character level squashes take the player away from their character immersion?
[1:24:49] HateField: we are worried :)
[1:24:52] Atomicpanda: like my car and the gas alarm
[1:24:53] butlerlog: the tank doing that and then killing the boss by themselves 30s later is peak DK
[1:24:57] NeeK_23: 99% REPAIR LuL
[1:25:05] Sorin__: Blood dk seems like such fun
[1:25:07] thunduz: mrgmFine  this is fine
[1:25:49] witcherpie: @kwazyk level squishes don't rly matter in games like wow where endgame is evrything. That would be really bad for a game like runescape tho
[1:25:55] Bambiprsi: in space nobody can hear you ... banjo!
[1:26:03] REDSUNDERGROUND: drop a quick reload
[1:26:17] darkscythe_123: restart obs? would that help
[1:26:25] thunduz: time to no camera stream it
[1:26:32] brennibrennt: Did you downgrade your PC?
[1:26:38] alextheblight: stam buff guzuDink
[1:26:44] Tolz47: Don't forget fort buff
[1:26:46] Harai_Ulfsark: i dont like waycrest manor bc the ceiling is too low, cant see shit
[1:26:46] thunduz: Mythic+ ASMR time
[1:26:48] kwazyk: I lost interest in wow after 3 level squashes.  alts just weren’t the same anymore TBH
[1:26:49] Greevers: is this on a Spotify playlist?
[1:27:08] chockoholick: whys you fps sooo bad?
[1:27:10] Harai_Ulfsark: @kwazyk we just had one tho
[1:27:20] Atomicpanda: churlish- having the taste of cinnamon and sugar.
[1:27:23] JarJar_Brinkz: it looks like 21
[1:27:32] kwazyk: I went through 3
[1:27:45] SerThunderbeans: It can be 21 average, but 1% lows could be 5, so it looks even more awful LUL
[1:27:48] darkscythe_123: I will never complain about 120 ever again
[1:27:48] kwazyk: played since vanilla
[1:28:01] Harai_Ulfsark: the only level squish that ever happened in wow was in shadowlands
[1:28:06] Nexusshade: @TaliesinAndEvitel what's your ilvl dangPOG
[1:28:10] witcherpie: im pretty sure there was only 1 level squish from vanilla up to today
[1:28:18] Blighthung: Quazii explains very well how to improve performance by doing some changes in your Graphics Settings.
[1:28:29] crittu90: slightly over % :(
[1:28:34] T1TANZ_78: 1 stat squich 1 level squish
[1:28:37] Gremi_the_Greenbean: Cheer100 hey you guys stream!? Nice! Love your vids, now I can enjoy your streams.
[1:28:54] Lightbringer2001: @Gremi_the_Greenbean welcome in!
[1:29:10] Atomicpanda: ten deaths? maybe it really is time to repair. heh
[1:29:11] kwazyk: arena rank squash from vanilla to later too
[1:29:49] Phenroi: You stand back far enough and they will never hit you
[1:30:09] witcherpie: ah this boss is great for 3 melees LUL
[1:30:25] Tolz47: What's the addon called the just the K's in the numbers
[1:30:27] kwazyk: just makes it harder to want to gear up anymore when you know they will be useless soon.
[1:30:43] jdodge1305: @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:30:59] jdodge1305: I think you have to stand outside the stones to not get hit, or on the stairs behind
[1:31:06] SilverkissTwitch: @kwazyk What...? Gear becomes useless with every new patch/expansion regardless of whether there is a stat squish or not. New gear is always better.
[1:31:43] Atomicpanda: behind the drogbar stones, on the drogbar stairs
[1:31:58] witcherpie: i mean you dont rly play retail to gear up, you only gear up to do higher level content, you don't gear up for the sake of  gearing up like in classic
[1:32:32] kwazyk: it always has been, but forcing one to relevel/rerank, just gets monotonous
[1:32:48] kwazyk: gear was always temp thing
[1:32:51] Atomicpanda: i just gear up because i like the higher ilevel number.
[1:33:08] clover_north: Lately just been playing retail to get my token but I've been thinking about coming back to do keys
[1:33:29] Deatheran: keys are amazing now that they swap the dungeons every season.
[1:33:37] witcherpie: yep but getting good gear in retail is just the beginning of the game, in classic you can safely quit after getting the gear.
[1:33:44] SilverkissTwitch: @kwazyk Look into Guild Wars 2 if you haven't, that MMO only has horizontal progression so you don't have this issue there (and it's a fun one anyway)
[1:33:52] Deatheran: before it was monotonous for sure. but now its great
[1:34:06] kwazyk: true witchpie. I just think time investment into characters is at a loss.
[1:34:28] clover_north: Funny thing is dragonflight is objectively better in nearly all ways than SL but I slammed SL too hard and basically couldn't enjoy the expansion after hitting level cap
[1:34:31] Blighthung: you have one
[1:34:32] Atomicpanda: glad they added the keyring
[1:35:01] T1TANZ_78: i want a M+ vendor.  i've been running Rise ALL SEASON and have not seen the damn gun drop or in my vault.  that's insane
[1:35:17] witcherpie: @kwazyk true, a game that nails character progression for decades is runescape, no other game like this, every level matters, forever
[1:35:18] REDSUNDERGROUND: so hear me out 16 dungeons rotation  per  season random affix  and dungeons on a weekly  rotation
[1:35:31] chimeraxst: I wish they would had a 3k mount and maybe a 3500 mount just to incentivise to push higher.
[1:35:37] kwazyk: I do lie the DF professions remake.  Feels more worth time investment
[1:35:39] clover_north: @T1TANZ_78 That would be really cool, maybe they could unlock it more than halfway into each season
[1:35:53] Blighthung: You are awesome Talie. Very good group. congrats.
[1:35:58] Gh0stBadger: GG
[1:36:00] Tolz47: EZ
[1:36:02] Shirey12: do a 23 DHT and youll be close
[1:36:03] sapphire_rosa_: tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:36:05] T1TANZ_78: @clover_north agreed
[1:36:18] Phenroi: I'm at 2871. going for 3k as well! best of luck and hope you get there
[1:36:19] HSAyril: What a cuck. Ibwas literally 1 point off from 2,500 a couple of weeks ago lol
[1:36:30] Tolz47: Rip
[1:36:42] Phenroi: Can't swap above 18
[1:36:47] REDSUNDERGROUND: rise is  a literal   cakewalk  this  week
[1:36:50] SerThunderbeans: AHH YEEEEA! LUL Muro lez gooo!
[1:37:00] Blighthung: You need to lower it do the same level and swao it.
[1:37:00] Thuretical: drop it to a 22 or 23, time a 22 or 23, then swap
[1:37:11] SerThunderbeans: I got a 22 Atal if you like BeanieHipster
[1:37:19] clover_north: Oh dang I kind of want to do WM... is it rotating out next season?
[1:37:22] Deatheran: you can swap at any level, just not if they key is higher than the dungeon level
[1:37:22] Atomicpanda: time to log in. ... oh. it's tuesday. right.
[1:37:37] Shirey12: do you get an achieve for hitting 3k?
[1:37:44] Atomicpanda: guess i'll just got pvp on the forums
[1:37:56] T1TANZ_78: i think you get armor cosmetic effect
[1:37:57] Blighthung: BRH is sold
[1:38:00] kwazyk: I was hoping the would allow us to use our alts as dungeon delve npcs…. that would be nice.
[1:38:07] Thuretical: @T1TANZ_78 2.5k
[1:38:07] sniz____: but half a inch,  worth :D
[1:38:14] Shirey12: I hit 2.7k and I don't see hitting 3k lol i'll farm my 20s and be a degen
[1:38:30] NeeK_23: Personal Best is the only reward after 2500, unless youre right at the top going for 0.1% title
[1:38:39] shadowsliver24: @Shirey12 difference between a 20 and 21 is neglectable
[1:38:55] clover_north: Of all the things to be hyped about this year it's actually the transmog changes that are bringing me back to retail
[1:38:59] umagar: That group was sick, but tallie healing a slideshow made it even better :P
[1:39:17] netonkent: Does anyone know if the ahenvale event in sod still on and played ?
[1:39:27] NeeK_23: I have an Atal 22 and I hate life
[1:39:29] Atomicpanda: repair
[1:39:36] netonkent: PvP Ashenvale
[1:39:42] clover_north: I'm putting together a speed set on my druid to nolife some old raids
[1:39:44] Deatheran: Tali do you have like 3 wows running in the background LOL
[1:39:47] Shirey12: nothing hurts more than getting a DOTI key
[1:39:49] Harai_Ulfsark: dragonsliding
[1:40:09] alextheblight: same :(
[1:40:12] funviking99: some people think that means you can use all types of armor  LUL
[1:40:23] rowanoaken: Yeah I'm trying to make the best of DF while it's still current :')
[1:40:35] Harai_Ulfsark: we like desk
[1:40:36] NeeK_23: whenever people say wow looks old, images like this tells me they havent played in years. DF is very modern
[1:40:37] Shirey12: camera angle is fine :)
[1:40:38] Thuretical: desk pog
[1:40:40] kwazyk: @clover_north very true. Has anyone tried the pug ai npc dungeon runs?
[1:40:40] Atomicpanda: watch the weather change when he goes a foot farther.
[1:40:41] AlfredK: This is fine
[1:40:41] gildrean: desk is classy
[1:40:44] Pannekaker: I love seeing a little bit of your desk
[1:40:44] S1cnus: I like it!
[1:40:48] brennibrennt: Hide that filthy desk!
[1:40:49] T1TANZ_78: we like it but put easter egg items on it every steam
[1:40:51] alextheblight: oh neat
[1:40:51] thunduz: I like it
[1:41:07] placeholdername33: what keyboad mat are you using?
[1:41:07] clover_north: Keep it messy though no unrealistic beauty standards in this stream @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:41:08] alextheblight: TableHere FlipThis
[1:41:12] Thuretical: coffee mug merch incoming
[1:41:14] sniz____: just the tip, of the desk :)
[1:41:18] S1cnus: desk pr0n
[1:41:21] AlfredK: Haha I didn't mean it like that
[1:41:25] Atomicpanda: it sort of teases is he wearing pants or not
[1:41:27] Sorin__: Coffee there is selling the bit of desk for me
[1:41:37] caradosailanthus: Just make sure to keep it tidy so your desk looks as big as possible
[1:41:39] T1TANZ_78: now we know how the sausage is made!!!!  /cry
[1:41:45] rowanoaken: Someone made a mouse mat for Samantha Beart and it was like one of those boob mousemats, but the padded bit was Karlach's bicep I love it
[1:42:06] thunduz: the alliance one?
[1:42:25] thunduz: I think? I don’t remember lol
[1:42:34] clover_north: What do we think about blizzard releasing an official wow tarot deck
[1:42:36] Phenroi: I have an Alliance rbg mouse mat and love it!
[1:42:45] Shirey12: Tali I liked your video on Steve, however I can't forgive him still.
[1:43:36] Xephur123: He did the beat he could having been dealt such a bad hand
[1:43:42] Xephur123: Best*
[1:43:53] clover_north: I agree @Xephur123
[1:44:20] Shirey12: he created a war with the players that play classic and retail and it's hard to end this version war of the game
[1:44:55] knightjudicator: when did Danuser move to the marketing dept?
[1:44:56] cabeshpash: @Shirey12 that rift has always existed, nothing to do with steve
[1:45:07] netonkent: Even accolonn seems to regret how he treated him
[1:45:12] cabeshpash: lmao what is this
[1:45:18] Deatheran: was it not mike ybara (not sure how to spell his name) who created that feeling
[1:45:19] lastdeviljoker666: lol
[1:45:19] T1TANZ_78: it would mostly be classic playing "thinking" there's a war because of their elitism
[1:45:19] rowanoaken: Hell yeah lmao
[1:45:21] HSAyril: Lmao
[1:45:21] chico_escuela: lmao the struggle to find the cam
[1:45:26] AlfredK: Classic players panicking when there is more than 1 mechanic
[1:45:51] KatieRet_: I am!
[1:46:00] shadowsliver24: The problem with the whole situation is that what happened in BFA and shadowlands is cannon now. Many thing I really didn't like.
[1:46:05] Shirey12: When I played with my guild in BFA and classic came out, it left a bad taste in their mouths and still can't convince my ex guildies to come back to retail. It's just a personal experience
[1:46:07] KralYoshii: @TaliesinAndEvitel do some m+ on NA
[1:46:28] clover_north: @KralYoshii NA still down but he's pushing 3k
[1:46:35] clover_north: can't do that on another account :)
[1:46:38] GardenVarietyNecromancer: Quick, Tali's gone, put chairs in front of the door
[1:46:47] kwazyk: lol
[1:46:52] T1TANZ_78: if he tried NA servers his 12 fps would seem like 120 fps lol
[1:46:55] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel on retail side it feels kinda like we enjoy it all. but i still see alot of classic players love to shit on retail. i wonder why LUL
[1:47:10] Shirey12: @Deatheran my point I was trying to make
[1:47:23] JarJar_Brinkz: Classic players shit on retail, but also don't even play classic LUL
[1:47:34] LilSmashi: lol they hate that
[1:47:34] S1cnus: Something happen to your head rest on your chair?  Looks like it's broken off.
[1:47:41] Yenma57: they dont have flying and transmog, so we win either way
[1:47:43] HSAyril: It does, though
[1:48:03] clover_north: because of all the classic variants and the state of retail now is the best time to own a wow subscription maybe ever
[1:48:05] siegeorc: siegeorc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months, currently on a 43 month streak! Have a great day!
[1:48:05] gildrean: only complaint with retail is its a touch too frilly sometimes, I like the gritty classic feel, e.g. Chromie wanting to make friends with an enemy but cares too much about their makeup
[1:48:06] Deatheran: @Shirey12 a vocal majority of thsoe people dont actualy play it, they just love the content of saying "GAME BAD"
[1:48:06] thunduz: I am back needed to make coffee lol
[1:48:23] the_howlermonkey: Literally 95% of the reason I play classic is because it is easier and more laid back
[1:48:26] Lightbringer2001: Big 48 PogU
[1:48:32] NeeK_23: Amirdrassil took a week to clear . Molten Core killed in 12 hours.
[1:48:32] Greevers: THE Putin??
[1:48:33] butlerlog: i mean we call SoD Season of Dads, there are always going to be vocal people who get upset about everything, but the game not being an e-sport is part of the appeal
[1:49:01] clover_north: the one thing classic has over retail is that it doesn't have the theme park feeling... Somethings retail feels very empty
[1:49:01] rowanoaken: He did just do that interview with Tucker Carlson - you could be the next dude to interview Putin lol
[1:49:22] shadowsliver24: shadowsliver24 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[1:49:22] netonkent: That's cause you're a dirty communist Tali 😝😝💙
[1:49:36] Zulyagan: whats the key he's doing?
[1:49:44] funviking99: it’s good for retail
[1:49:47] JarJar_Brinkz: @clover_north thats funny because literally half of classic is empty and open space for running LUL
[1:49:47] T1TANZ_78: i'm mocking it!!! come at me bros
[1:49:50] saarkhastick: Am I hearing banjo?
[1:49:53] kwazyk: does everyone think that Blizzard has the ability to automate play er account alts to do npc things in like a guild keep/ player house type of atmosphere?
[1:49:56] Deatheran: the post clasic era if you will LUL
[1:50:04] Discordant_Hats: SoD recaptures the *feeling* players were looking for, in a way original classic wasn't going to do for everyone.
[1:50:11] Blighthung: RISE +24
[1:50:13] gabekan: I tried, not for me too
[1:50:19] thunduz: has Evi let you play Spiderman 2 on her PS5 yet?
[1:50:31] Blighthung: Unless someone has BRH
[1:50:31] clover_north: @JarJar_Brinkz not saying you're wrong but retail content kind of silos players off into where the core content is. I also think flying has a lot to do with it ngl
[1:50:32] Shirey12: Classic needs a gold sink. the 2 major points of classic is Economy, and Botting. The economy will grow and grow like Era did and now if you want to raid Naxx, you need gold cap (214k). and I've seen GDKP's sell a Gressil off Kel'thuzad for 3 times gold cap. it's awful.
[1:50:36] Sorin__: I really enjoy the short form of sod, you can play a couple of weeks, be done, then come back in 2 months for the next bit of levelling
[1:50:54] thunduz: nooooooo
[1:51:04] T1TANZ_78: how convenient.....
[1:51:07] S1cnus: My only issue with SoD is the amount of time it takes to level from 26-40 vs 1-25.  I think they should make it (Phase 2) as alt friendly as Phase 1
[1:51:12] zhonatop: It's like rugby league vs rugby union, most fans are fine for the other version of the game to exist, a lot enjoy both but a minority (of league lol) fans can't resist insisting their version of the game it best.
[1:51:29] thunduz: tneTrundleMaldini Wales is more about the DC life
[1:51:31] Shirey12: to buy items
[1:51:33] clover_north: @TaliesinAndEvitel inflation in the economy basically.\
[1:51:51] bigdog420: yeah the economy on era is fucked
[1:51:58] CeasiusPls: EcoFlow is great for power cuts
[1:52:08] Greevers: damn I’m working
[1:52:09] KatieRet_: pudn has DHT 19
[1:52:22] clover_north: Thoughts on the official wow tarot cards? Personally idk but more curious who they're actually for
[1:52:29] funviking99: there is such a content drought in retail, it’s nothing to do with
[1:52:31] Blighthung: Yes
[1:52:33] T1TANZ_78: we need to get tali a generator and some solar panels so they can be energy independent
[1:52:34] lordcommandah: u play eu or US?
[1:52:42] Blighthung: but you need to od the same level
[1:52:54] S1cnus: Don't you have to run a dungeon and then swap?
[1:52:54] gabekan: I feel all of these variations of WoW will be empty servers soon. I really hope not, but its all hype nowadays
[1:52:54] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel you can swap it at the end of an == dungeon
[1:53:00] shadowsliver24: You can swap it if you finish a m+ of the same level
[1:53:00] Blighthung: do sorry
[1:53:10] REDSUNDERGROUND: you have to time a key of similar level    to change yours
[1:53:17] bigdog420: yeah theres like 4 different versions of classic at this point
[1:53:18] lordcommandah: i have dht 24 i can lower it
[1:53:35] clover_north: @gabekan I've noticed there's fewer people raiding in sod already. Wondering who will still be around at the end
[1:53:35] REDSUNDERGROUND: unless you  lower your key yes
[1:53:38] Deatheran: correct
[1:53:40] shadowsliver24: Time a key that's the same or higher, and you can swap your key at the panda woman at the end of dungeon
[1:53:46] Sorin__: No need to worry about when the fun will end if it's fun now
[1:54:06] Shirey12: I have hope for retail and always will. I love the game. I really enjoy Metzen has come home. Last time we had a expansion with him was Legion and it was an amazing time to play the game. His narrative is heroic.
[1:54:07] funviking99: are you lagging or me?
[1:54:10] TownieTV: npc in valdrakken can downgrade it
[1:54:12] tosk: You talk to lindormi in valdrakken to downgrade it, no need to go to the dungeon
[1:54:12] REDSUNDERGROUND: you can  lower iut at  the  panda in front of the portal  room  entrance
[1:54:12] dabura90: the panda in valdrakken can drop it for u
[1:54:13] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel theres a pandaren in valdraken
[1:54:18] Deatheran: that lets you lower them
[1:54:21] Phenroi: Talk tot eh panda lady in Vald and she'll lower it for you
[1:54:24] gabekan: @clover_north yeah, same. The server I played I rarely see enemy faction
[1:54:24] Blighthung: just talk to the npc in Val she will lower the key
[1:54:24] witcherpie: @taliesinandevitel u can downgrade keys in vqldrqkken btw
[1:54:28] TownieTV: the panda lady by the portal
[1:54:32] caradosailanthus: same one is in the timeways
[1:54:32] rowanoaken: It's the panda lady near the portal :)
[1:54:37] Pannekaker: Yeah, the panda lady by the portals ^^
[1:54:41] Yenma57: holy fps, why is it so low
[1:54:42] thunduz: just wait for WoW to go on GamePass tneTali tneTaliShill
[1:54:47] Arlaeya: How do I know this and I barely do keys, lol?
[1:54:51] Blighthung: close window and do it again.
[1:54:52] S1cnus: lol
[1:55:13] TownieTV: still need end of dungeon to swap it
[1:55:14] Shirey12: you can't swap keys
[1:55:15] spenseb: 2nd option
[1:55:16] NeeK_23: you cant
[1:55:17] Deatheran: you cant swap it here
[1:55:20] REDSUNDERGROUND: you cannot  swap  it  unles you  time a simliar  level  key
[1:55:21] lordcommandah: inv easypala-kazzak. i cannot find u in lfg
[1:55:21] tosk: No you can't swap it like that. You gotta do a dungeon that's 22 or higher, then you can swap key to *random key*
[1:55:22] plopsmurf: you cant :)
[1:55:24] REDSUNDERGROUND: that isnt yours
[1:55:24] S1cnus: you have toi run a key... then exchange at the end
[1:55:25] Deatheran: you have to do it at the end of a dungeon
[1:55:28] Shirey12: you have to finish your key for an rng chance at a dungeon
[1:55:33] Pannekaker: @TaliesinAndEvitel After you've timed a key, she spawns in the dungeon
[1:55:33] dabura90: you still have to time a key of same level to swap it
[1:55:35] spenseb: Oh wait no nevermind
[1:55:36] Blighthung: now you need to do a dungeon at level 22
[1:55:37] plopsmurf: you gamba
[1:55:39] REDSUNDERGROUND: at the end of a  timed 22
[1:55:47] KatieRet_: the npc is at the end of the dungeon
[1:55:51] D3MO_lition: npc is only in the instance you just finished
[1:55:54] draki259: Theres a npc at the end you talk to
[1:55:55] Enigmio: its only possible at the end of the dungeon
[1:55:56] TownieTV: you can go into your cleared dungeon maybe
[1:55:56] rowanoaken: I think it has to be someone else's key then you can swap
[1:56:00] Deatheran: and there was an NPC at the end of that 23 that could have swapped it
[1:56:03] REDSUNDERGROUND: it  can be any  22
[1:56:03] NeeK_23: any 22
[1:56:03] Shirey12: yes, but it will be randomized dungeon
[1:56:03] Pannekaker: Any
[1:56:06] Deatheran: no ANY key
[1:56:07] dabura90: no you have to run a different key
[1:56:08] S1cnus: The dungeon swap person is ONLY at the end of the ... yes.
[1:56:09] Silentphoto: its RNG to a random key
[1:56:10] shadowsliver24: Tali, when you finish a m+ that's the same level or higher, this panda spawns at the end of the dungeon for a random switch
[1:56:11] witcherpie: You can run any key and swap at npc end of dung
[1:56:12] Sorin__: No it was too high then
[1:56:14] Bambiprsi: you have to run any key at the same level or higher of your key and timwe it then you can swap it at the end
[1:56:19] Blighthung: you can only swap it at the end of a dungeon.
[1:56:20] REDSUNDERGROUND: you   cant swap your own  key  at the  end of a  dungeon
[1:56:21] dabura90: you can only swap yours if you run someone elses key
[1:56:23] Enigmio: this system is so dumb
[1:56:24] HSAyril: F
[1:56:28] tosk: No, you cannot swap your own key at the end of a run, you gotta time someone elses key at the level yours is at, or higher.
[1:56:28] AndreMSAL: you need to run a same difficult  or higher TIMED dungeon (any) and you swap your key at the end of the dungeon.
[1:56:31] Blighthung: yes
[1:56:36] NeeK_23: any key you time higher or equal to what you have, can be swapped
[1:56:38] Xephur123: Run someone else's at 22 or higher
[1:56:39] holyzeke: maybe you still can, go back
[1:56:47] Shirey12: It's just best to find someone with the key Tali
[1:56:48] D3MO_lition: if you run your own key you cannot swap the key, you can only swap keys if it is someone elses key
[1:56:48] JarJar_Brinkz: I have no idea whats going on, but its great to know im just as confused as Tali iacoSway
[1:56:53] RoboticUnicorn007: The npc to swap keys is inside the end of the dungeon
[1:56:55] butlerlog: if you run your own it changes anyway. the npc is at the end of someone else's timed key
[1:56:57] REDSUNDERGROUND: run that 24  dht
[1:57:00] Blighthung: Better chances to get into someone's key.
[1:57:04] thunduz: yay
[1:57:08] darkscythe_123: you got a run someone’s elskey for you to swap your key at the 22 or higher
[1:57:23] REDSUNDERGROUND: someone did
[1:57:30] tosk: You can do /keys and it'll show you the groups keys
[1:57:45] Blighthung: too low not to be mean
[1:57:46] Deatheran: yea /keys to spy on what keys your group has
[1:57:58] lordcommandah: easypala kazzak
[1:58:08] shadowsliver24: /keys only works with elvui I think
[1:58:09] JarJar_Brinkz: Strongarm a key from your viewers iacoSway
[1:58:15] Blighthung: ask monk if he has one
[1:58:26] REDSUNDERGROUND: @shadowsliver24 its  details

[2:01:57] plopsmurf: you can do 25 ez
[2:01:57] lordcommandah: it is fine i want to do 1 weekly
[2:02:02] Tenga66: @TaliesinAndEvitel Look, party keys on that screen.
[2:02:02] Harper_n7: Are you a Ricky Gervais fan?
[2:02:05] plopsmurf: Get some pumpers
[2:02:09] NeeK_23: group needs to be in dungeons for cross faction
[2:02:28] saarkhastick: Derek!
[2:02:31] JarJar_Brinkz: OOF
[2:02:32] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[2:02:34] holyzeke: wait…what add on tells you the affixes next week????
[2:02:36] bigdog420: strong agree
[2:02:45] Deatheran: GL finding the exact propper group
[2:02:46] runehako: oh dam what he do to be trash out of curiosity
[2:02:48] Blighthung: I whish I could be your tank. I would totally do my best I'm 3046 Prot Pally in US Zul'jin
[2:02:49] saarkhastick: Extras is pretty hysterial
[2:02:57] Harper_n7: I was curious cuz the last couple streams I've caught myself hearing you a couple times and thinking you sounded like Ricky
[2:03:01] cabeshpash: Ricky Gervais went hard on the transphobic jokes, sad to see
[2:03:17] Blighthung: Engram is a beast
[2:03:18] sander1066: sander1066 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[2:03:43] saarkhastick: I've heard that too!
[2:03:44] plopsmurf: HOW
[2:03:45] runehako: i mean jokes are jokes. did he trash on em outside of standup?
[2:03:59] REDSUNDERGROUND: prot wariors are slept on  100%  of the time
[2:04:00] Harper_n7: Not as in like you being a terrible person, but the sound, accent and a laugh or two
[2:04:00] runehako: if so then yeah fuck him
[2:04:15] holyzeke: Ricky Gervais just donated 2 million to animal charities so he’s not total shit
[2:04:20] cabeshpash: @runehako that's a lame excuse
[2:04:27] Harper_n7: might just have been similar because of voice, accent, etc
[2:04:50] KralYoshii: @TaliesinAndEvitel what Football club do you support?
[2:05:05] Discordant_Hats: Though for what it's worth to that question in chat, yes he has been openly transphobic outside of stand-up anyways
[2:05:07] runehako: i dont defend transphobia. im just curious what he said
[2:05:21] runehako: thought he was cool so its a let down
[2:05:36] runehako: thats fair
[2:05:48] plopsmurf: How did Trans people become so important in 5 years
[2:06:03] holyzeke: DHT can fuck right off the bat
[2:06:05] Blighthung: You got this guys good luck.
[2:06:05] Reksanar: I dont defend transphobia , but I really can care less if someone is doing a transphobic jokes. I mean they are jokes and they are funny cuz of the real issue
[2:06:05] HSAyril: Not a defender of people who don't like Trans, but I've always wondered why people call them transphobes when they don't have a phobia of them
[2:06:13] REDSUNDERGROUND: honestly all jokes have a time and place just depends on the audience i believe and the delivery  obviously
[2:06:17] the_howlermonkey: i feel like he is probably just a dick. BUT, Derek is REALLY good
[2:06:18] knightjudicator: @plopsmurf as capitalism decays it needs enemies to blame
[2:06:36] JMcGhee559: aside from even him telling specifically transphobic jokes, i really don't like humor that punches down
[2:06:58] nekrojiji: trans peopel are sick
[2:07:03] shadowsliver24: DHT is one of the few dungeons where I pop pain supression on myself cause of the stupid tigers. So painful
[2:07:05] chockoholick: isnt that what black comedy is all about ??
[2:07:07] Harai_Ulfsark: also -phobia also means aversion in general
[2:07:08] sapphire_rosa_: @nekrojiji get bent
[2:07:13] hyugaftw: @nekrojiji wreong stream buddy
[2:07:16] knightjudicator: @chockoholick no
[2:07:17] HSAyril: Ahh yeah, I can see that
[2:07:21] cabeshpash: @nekrojiji yikes
[2:07:29] vlaovich88: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[2:07:31] chockoholick: no crossing the line
[2:07:32] netonkent: It is such a low form of comedy, its not intelligent nor creative in anyway
[2:07:38] plopsmurf: @knightjudicator It is also used by just Liberals that they can pretend they care about
[2:07:39] Vendrek: Wow...walked into an interesting convo...
[2:07:40] aeson_of_raid_sock: I watched the six nations documentary on Netflix and saw rugby player salaries aren’t very high. footballers get huge salaries so why’s there such a disparity?
[2:07:43] Kortinas: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[2:07:46] sapphire_rosa_: @Harai_Ulfsark yeah this too , some of it is fear based but some of it is hatred rather than fear
[2:07:54] cabeshpash: @netonkent 100%, it's just so lazy
[2:08:10] NeeK_23: @aeson_of_raid_sock football brings in more tv viewers, money, sponsorships
[2:08:28] Sorin__: Phobia is also about aversion not just fear
[2:08:30] KralYoshii: @TaliesinAndEvitel what football club do you support?
[2:08:31] netonkent: @cabeshpash  🙂
[2:08:32] knightjudicator: @plopsmurf so true, though that does come as a reaction to the conservatives
[2:08:32] aeson_of_raid_sock: I was surprised. I thought it was more popular
[2:08:38] chockoholick: black comedy is crossing the bowndry line of acceptable.   some are just worse than others
[2:08:49] rundownnappar: wait hold up am i here for the rare gameplay stream :P
[2:08:57] runehako: yeah didnt know his jokes were like that. yeah thats fuccked
[2:08:59] Blighthung: Let's respect everybody for what they are.  should we.
[2:09:01] chockoholick: and i just realised im bad at typing :)
[2:09:13] Harper_n7: Didn't mean to steer the conversation to this, mb
[2:09:36] Sorin__: Oh he's absolutely stoking fear, just for the person asking why call it phobia, it doesn't just mean literal fear
[2:09:39] Kortinas: Being Enby Trans over here, it just sucks to know people hate me so much for just existing
[2:09:40] knightjudicator: @chockoholick it also doesnt punch down, its usually "black" because you're self deprecating and using lived trauma (or current events) to joke about
[2:10:01] holyzeke: life is too short to hate anything
[2:10:02] vlaovich88: @chockoholick I think you are referring to dark comedy. Black comedy makes it sound like ykh are referring to black comedians.
[2:10:18] sapphire_rosa_: @Kortinas i'm so sorry mate :( FWIW there are also many people who support and respect you <3
[2:10:28] casualviewerxqt: fps are collapsing i think
[2:10:49] plopsmurf: @knightjudicator True, they draw this battle line to get ez votes either way. Super lame development, like people legit think they are doing something amazing by "protecting trans people"
[2:10:51] Kortinas: @sapphire_rosa_ Thank you 🖤 TransgenderPride NonbinaryPride tneJellycat
[2:11:02] chockoholick: yeh there are versions of black comedy   but to come across as black comedy there needs to be someone who is either offended or aimed at to degrade them  its not nice but  thats what happend
[2:11:12] caradosailanthus: Which one is he on the Office?
[2:11:27] chockoholick: @vlaovich88 haha  yes  that what i mean :)
[2:11:42] hyugaftw: yeah, creating a culture starting with a jokes is a literal thing. Sexism in the workplace is funny until some gets SA'd
[2:12:06] plopsmurf: KEKW
[2:12:07] thunduz: tneEvi
[2:12:32] naturesremedy: I love disc
[2:12:37] warrenny: depends on the person alot of ppl are more racist as theyget older. younger ppl are likely more accepting
[2:12:39] naturesremedy: 2nd favorite healer
[2:12:41] holyzeke: pallys love to off heal
[2:12:54] Blighthung: @Kortinas You are not alone friend It's just that the world can't understand how especial and unique some can be.
[2:12:56] thunduz: yay for youth
[2:13:19] bordum: it used to mean cigarrette
[2:13:32] warrenny: @bordum still does here
[2:13:35] Harper_n7: Have you seen the South Park episode about that word?
[2:13:37] vlaovich88: We all grow. I would hate what I thought was funny in high school today. But didn't know any better.
[2:13:38] Kortinas: @blighthung Thank you TransgenderPride NonbinaryPride
[2:13:46] thunduz: some times where I look back at jokes I've made when younger and was like hmm, not a good one on my part, oops
[2:13:49] puntualus: puntualus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! T&E FTW i hope the ceiling is ok tneSuperM3
[2:13:50] butlerlog: people said it specifically because it wasnt ok, that was the purpose
[2:13:51] REDSUNDERGROUND: na  is  up
[2:14:06] Harper_n7: a bit?
[2:14:08] clover_north: vault time!
[2:14:25] Discordant_Hats: Yeah waaay too many people aren't willing to self-reflect. See it with ex-gamergaters n such a lot, "congratulate me on being different now, but also trust me that I basically didn't do anything wrong anyways." Doesn't feel like a lesson learnt then really.
[2:14:32] rowanoaken: Oh this dude has caused so many wipes...
[2:14:34] dknamey: whats the other one yazma?
[2:14:41] warrenny: whats the other?
[2:15:10] puntualus: that boss interacting to druids with legion artifacts is very cool
[2:15:12] bordum: i feel like its all about context and intention
[2:15:18] smee3x: Cucumber?
[2:15:23] cabeshpash: lol when did Shakespeare use it?
[2:15:30] chockoholick: yeh the other day someasked me if i was from Manchester  and as a proud Yorkshire man i was very insulted
[2:15:31] warrenny: shakespear used it?
[2:15:34] plopsmurf: Only to Americans I think
[2:15:36] netonkent: I used to use it , to refer to an bundle of wood and at a bomb fire party I got really yelled at
[2:15:47] JMcGhee559: As a guy a bit older than Tali, the word that I've had the most trouble with trying to not use is "guys" when referring to a group of people.
[2:16:10] warrenny: dbm helps with that
[2:16:10] cabeshpash: @JMcGhee559 this is really hard as a midwesterner
[2:16:16] thunduz: @JMcGhee559 same, or dudes
[2:16:17] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel Did you see the tarot Cards for wow coming in November?
[2:16:23] kwazyk: @jmcghee559 agree with you there
[2:16:25] chockoholick: the C word is said every day on clasic 80s radio stations when they play Falco's  Amadeous (clearly spelt wrong"
[2:16:26] cabeshpash: ya'll just sounds awkward if you're not southern
[2:16:29] warrenny: @jmcghee559 really? i do it alot
[2:16:40] frankenfoot5: I use guys/folks interchangeably as a gender neutral term. In person everyone seems to get my intent
[2:16:46] dastago: how come your fps is so low?
[2:16:47] Aristyne: @JMcGhee559 is that a bad thing now also?
[2:17:03] cabeshpash: @frankenfoot5 yeah I've never seen anyone offended by it, but it's not very polite I feel like
[2:17:10] chockoholick: @JMcGhee559 but guys  is a term for a group of people
[2:17:27] clover_north: It's 2024 and we've had some version of the great vault for quite a while now. Why can't I have my character info panel open at the same time as the vault still?
[2:17:29] cabeshpash: think of it if someone called a group of guys "girls"
[2:17:34] JMcGhee559: some people would prefer not to be called "guys" and that's cool I wish i could use folks or peopel, or everyone etc
[2:17:43] runehako: yous guyses
[2:17:53] shadowsliver24: Dudes is better.
[2:17:53] holyzeke: if you have void tendrils you can use it for the add
[2:17:57] cabeshpash: the problem is there's not a good replacement for guys lol
[2:17:59] Honorbound94: lol just use "y'all"
[2:18:01] Bambiprsi: i started using "pals" as gender neutral for wow social behaviour
[2:18:13] chockoholick: you cant go round  pleaseing everyone
[2:18:19] cabeshpash: ya'll sounds weird if you're not southern, and everyone sounds awkward lol
[2:18:24] Discordant_Hats: I've had so many arguments, as a trans lass, with people saying "I use dude gender neutrally" and I say "well just don't call ME dude" and this *melts their fucking brains.*
[2:18:26] chockoholick: some people get offended by anything nowadays
[2:18:27] rws26: Guys is really gender-neutral, are there really people who think guys is referring to only men?
[2:18:29] JMcGhee559: when people point out that something bothers then you can change though
[2:18:53] JMcGhee559: (or try to)
[2:19:05] cabeshpash: @rws26 it's not gender neutral
[2:19:11] frankenfoot5: Folks is my go-to substitute
[2:19:12] ramzie0: Love those people that get "offended" by the term "Cis"
[2:19:19] Blighthung: TALIESIN You deserve an award for being such a nice guy and all the contribution you do to the Wow community. BIG HUGS.
[2:19:20] Nayruna: I'm a waitress so started saying Folks instead, takes a bit to change behaviour
[2:19:22] Sorin__: I've moved to folks which works well with a Scottish accent imo
[2:19:30] Greevers: what about Ricky saying you can’t be offended due to the fact of it being a joke? not defending btw
[2:19:31] Tenga66: Time to start developing a twang and a y'all habit dsaKEKW
[2:19:37] netonkent: My girl friend always gets called bro in games , so she replies thanks sis and they always get super mad haha
[2:19:37] JMcGhee559: folks feels so awkward to me to say
[2:19:42] cabeshpash: folks makes me think of Obama
[2:19:42] plopsmurf: homies
[2:19:43] Ella_bebe: What about y'all?
[2:19:46] warrenny: savages?
[2:19:50] MeggoArt: y'all is pretty good for it
[2:19:52] clover_north: freinds
[2:19:55] thunduz: for me it was my dudes lol
[2:19:55] Kortinas: Tali are you gunna do Timewalking?
[2:19:56] Nayruna: also Tali I'm from the North East so the C word is a term of endearment haha
[2:19:57] NeeK_23: Magni got it right. call everyone "Champion"
[2:20:00] sapphire_rosa_: @McGreevers i think that is a very convenient excuse
[2:20:00] cabeshpash: lol lads is very British
[2:20:01] Papa_Rowdy: fellas
[2:20:03] SteelVGaming: There's a Marvel Snap Streamer that uses. "Guy, Gals and Non-Binary Pals" which I like a an alternative to "Guys"
[2:20:04] plopsmurf: akhi, homies
[2:20:05] Sorin__: British people can't say yall
[2:20:06] saarkhastick: Sorry, was alt+tabbed What was that about alien in your mouth?
[2:20:09] frankenfoot5: How about "peeps"?
[2:20:10] HSAyril: Try saying ya'll
[2:20:10] Discordant_Hats: Just call chat "me bairns."
[2:20:15] cabeshpash: lol yeah it sounds weird NGL
[2:20:21] agamitv: "ye"
[2:20:23] Theorof: As an official representative of the Southern US, we give you permission to say y'all.
[2:20:31] kwazyk: gang?
[2:20:36] JMcGhee559: @SteelVGaming I've said this in casual settings before, in professional settings i'd feel a bit funny saying it
[2:20:38] ButterStains: friends
[2:20:39] KeyouiX: the problem is guys is just too good a word
[2:20:40] Greevers: Fam?
[2:20:41] Honorbound94: @Theorof Amen brother. Tali gets the southern pass
[2:20:46] aeson_of_raid_sock: buddy
[2:20:49] kwazyk: fam is good
[2:20:51] vectrelica: fam
[2:20:51] plopsmurf: maybe your subconcious is just sexist PoroSad
[2:20:56] clover_north: Yeah there's really no need to gatekeep y'all
[2:20:57] Blighthung: @Kortinas I love TW, it's the most wonderful time of the year.
[2:21:03] Honorbound94: Could just say friends too haha
[2:21:05] cabeshpash: ya fam is good
[2:21:05] SteelVGaming: @JMcGhee559 Not tried it at work yet - but gonna give it a go!
[2:21:15] sander1066: Fun Fact: Man used to be gender neutral in Old English.
[2:21:19] thunduz: every time I write to T&E I write guys or dudes and after I send it I'm like I should really figure out a different way to put that, never remember to though lol
[2:21:20] cabeshpash: friend / friends most natural sounding probalby
[2:21:21] MrAxeffect: boss go long this week
[2:21:26] Sorin__: See thats a weird one, cos when I say man like that it's more of an exclamation than actually directed at someone
[2:21:35] MrAxeffect: Tank CD on throw
[2:21:36] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel the music you have playing is very soothing
[2:21:37] Kortinas: @blighthung Im gunna be doing TW later on stream!
[2:21:40] plopsmurf: You ever used Akhi?
[2:21:46] Greevers: pal is nice
[2:21:53] rws26: '“Guy” is no longer uniformly sex-specific. The plural form, guys, has become gender-inclusive in one subset of its functions – when it is used as a vocative, as in “Hi guys”, or more broadly to address people in the second person, as in “What are you guys doing tonight?”'  -Newcastle University,   so there are views on it the gender neutral way now
[2:21:56] Sorin__: Like "oh boy" doesn't have to be directed at a boy
[2:21:58] rowanoaken: The puns of this boss.. at least you get to listen to puns like "my bark is worse than my bite" more with tyrannical
[2:22:12] frankenfoot5: My least favorite part about DHT is always the trash between the first and second boss
[2:22:12] warrenny: dht is my fav
[2:22:14] thunduz: thunduz is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community!

[2:22:24] cosmopanda13: Did you watch the mdi at all? There were some some pretty cool moments
[2:22:31] Blighthung: @Kortinas Awesome I will check you out.
[2:22:37] frankenfoot5: AH! THANK YOU THUNDAZ!
[2:23:17] MrAxeffect: freedom
[2:23:17] warrenny: warrenny subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! i like it cos its the least punishing
[2:23:17] jdodge1305: Freedom
[2:23:20] magemaster225: bubble/freedom
[2:23:23] TheDeekins: @TaliesinAndEvitel you can clear roots with things like Freedom
[2:23:24] magemaster225: shapeshift gets you out too
[2:23:27] hyugaftw: theyre freedom + running over them
[2:23:27] warrenny: #bubble then run throu
[2:23:30] Blighthung: He is clearing
[2:24:14] MeggoArt: have we talked about the new Exploring Azeroth that was just found on amazon yet
[2:24:21] dastago: it kinda irks me when certain streamers just refer to everyone as "him" like i get the majority of your viewers are male but still
[2:24:34] frankenfoot5: Resto Shaman is pretty fun for dungeons I think
[2:24:47] FlutterBaby: @dastago or bois
[2:24:55] HSAyril: Wow tarot cards lol
[2:24:57] MeggoArt: Islands and Isles, covering KT, Zandalar, Dragon isles and broken isles
[2:25:00] kwazyk: Any interest in new Baldurs gate 3 runs to see the new romance / camp companion changes Talie?
[2:25:00] Sorin__: No interest in something like fistweaving?
[2:25:05] MeggoArt: written from Lorthemar and talryssa POV
[2:25:17] chryseis: Oh hell yeah
[2:25:22] sapphire_rosa_: i hate those eggs so much lol
[2:25:27] Kortinas: Oooo I must read
[2:25:32] sapphire_rosa_: @MeggoArt OOOO?????
[2:25:46] zhonatop: @dastago 100% I also notice this rubs off in game - that is one thing that is 100% worse in any iteration of Classic WoW
[2:25:55] warrenny: rabbit foot?
[2:26:03] HSAyril: As someone who loves Anduin's character (and doing WW cinematic Anduin for Blizzcon 2024), I really look forward to reading about Anduin's wanderings
[2:26:24] Bjerreh: why was this model of dragon never made a mount
[2:26:52] Blighthung: Good question
[2:26:54] Dazzaw17: i wonder if its tameable
[2:27:13] rowanoaken: Well those spikes on the back must be painful to sit on...
[2:27:16] MrAxeffect: the winds push les when close
[2:27:26] sapphire_rosa_: this one and the purple crystal one in Azure Archives, WHY NO MOUNT *cries*
[2:27:28] Kortinas: Is the new book up for preorders?
[2:27:29] warrenny: pirate dragon mount  like taza
[2:27:38] MrAxeffect: u can time
[2:27:42] GameingAspect: yer this timeri s fine
[2:28:16] Honorbound94: @MeggoArt Is it on Amazon?
[2:28:31] chockoholick: random question   how much is  a new graphics card  been romended something called  4070TI  ?
[2:28:46] GameingAspect: @chockoholick 600 pound
[2:28:55] chockoholick: jesus
[2:29:03] GameingAspect: yer
[2:29:08] Engram08: 800-1k
[2:29:16] sapphire_rosa_: 800 usd aye
[2:29:31] frankenfoot5: Are you listening to the Outer Wilds soundtrack while healing? That's awesome if so
[2:29:37] chockoholick: currently got something called 1660 TI  and  its starting to struggle
[2:29:38] Harper_n7: The 900s were great
[2:29:40] Memer1501: I've always bought the 80 series, feel like i can go one more generation before having the urge to buy again
[2:29:40] dastago: yeah i'm still rocking a 1070ti and it's going strong
[2:29:44] dragondognein: Calling anything Nvidia "bang for the buck" or "Good Value" these days seems wrong
[2:29:45] Tenga66: I gifter my 970 to a friend. He's still using it.
[2:29:52] frankenfoot5: Deep Space Banjo!
[2:29:54] Harper_n7: my 960 build outperformed 1070 builds for a long time
[2:30:10] plopsmurf: i still use my 1060
[2:30:16] Blighthung: I'm not sure if I can ask this in chat. but @kortinas what's your TTv name?
[2:30:22] GameingAspect: @GameingAspect  £550.96
[2:30:35] GameingAspect: for 4070 not ti
[2:30:39] sapphire_rosa_: gogogogogo
[2:30:45] rowanoaken: Get that bread :D
[2:31:01] chockoholick: @GameingAspect ty but at that price i might as well just by a new comp
[2:31:13] plopsmurf: i still use 1060 but I only play Classic wow and osrs LUL
[2:31:27] GameingAspect: @chockoholick i pre built my pc for 2k never need invest in it again for a long whilew
[2:31:43] GameingAspect: haste increses
[2:31:45] GameingAspect: yer
[2:31:49] darth_nykal: might be a slight waste due to dr
[2:31:51] holyzeke: 5 gold he gets killed by the falling stuff
[2:31:52] chockoholick: got mine 1 month before lock down in 2020   starting to show its age
[2:31:52] grin1ing: k
[2:32:00] grin1ing: isn't there a haste cup?
[2:32:08] ver_flashbang: Refreshing to see a somewhat vanilla UI in m+
[2:32:09] derbydave85: my pi target crys for it on the bl phase of fights so i guess so
[2:32:10] GameingAspect: not a haste cap for buffs
[2:32:27] grin1ing: LUL
[2:32:29] jdodge1305: it's straight haste % and not haste rating
[2:32:48] clover_north: chat what are timewarped badges actually good for i have a ton but have never spent them
[2:33:03] GameingAspect: buffs dont effect haste cap only raw stats on gear
[2:33:24] sniz____: gg buds :D
[2:33:28] sapphire_rosa_: sapphi212Gg sapphi212Gg sapphi212Gg sapphi212Gg
[2:33:33] grin1ing: Clap
[2:33:46] oglevvyy: Thoughts on asmongolds react to "war within dead?"
[2:34:14] darth_nykal: @oglevvyy no one who watcheshim has thoughts
[2:34:27] clover_north: Tali thoughts on the wow tarot cards?
[2:34:27] oglevvyy: @darth_nykal thats a lot of ppl.
[2:34:30] spettetgaming: can buy lvling gear for badges
[2:34:35] grin1ing: time to hunt for that branch trinket
[2:34:49] ver_flashbang: It was a super weird side tangent haha
[2:35:04] saarkhastick: Oh hey, wanna hear a great banjo piece? Look for Flight of the Cosmic Hippo by Bela Fleck. You  do need speakers with some decent bass support for best effect
[2:35:10] Papa_Rowdy: i thought that was delves
[2:35:10] oglevvyy: You have better takes mostly
[2:35:13] ver_flashbang: Bellular: HERO TALENTS baad asmon: the game is too hard :((
[2:35:20] Blighthung: Asmongold is a great guy. I just don't like the way he sometimes  bring toxicity to the wow community, I love this game so much.
[2:35:27] ButterStains: enjoying the music, what is it?
[2:35:29] darth_nykal: blizz doesnt have a good track record with balancing
[2:35:31] icycoolfresh: I like that they are willing to adjust them is good but I don't want to be the beta tester
[2:35:34] dotonbori: @Blighthung lol sometimes?
[2:35:37] eternitycrystal: @ver_flashbang they are really the vermin of wow community
[2:35:39] icycoolfresh: Agreed on them being visual
[2:35:49] Blighthung: Well you know, right ?
[2:35:57] Dazzaw17: playing my orc hunter as dark ranger is just weird...
[2:35:58] dastago: it is starting to feel like a repeat of covenants
[2:36:00] rowanoaken: Yeah I want to look and feel the fantasy - I'm not to bothered about the mechanics
[2:36:00] warrenny: hero talents are a similar idea
[2:36:05] clover_north: Honestly I would be just fine with hero archetypes being class skins
[2:36:09] darth_nykal: especially when they said dark ranger
[2:36:11] Discordant_Hats: Them not being class skins feels weird after DF's fan-service. Trying to do a gameplay system that also sort of half-asses a fan-idea...feels like something we'd moved on from.
[2:36:11] oglevvyy: we just like your takes :)
[2:36:12] grin1ing: i'm mostly concerned with story being more in focus for world-soul saga...
[2:36:15] ver_flashbang: @eternitycrystal He had some points about the wa/addon additional awareness stuff but it felt like a super weird side tangent out of nowhere haha
[2:36:29] frankenfoot5: I know I'm probably in the minority, but I'm still excited for hero talents. I'm just gonna pick the coolest/thematic one for me and move on
[2:36:46] RoboticUnicorn007: Update OBS and Graphics card drivers after stream
[2:36:57] agamitv: they should add the hero talents as a form of character progress, just remove the cosmetic side of it and let us choose the skin/theme we want without getting locked on something because is better
[2:37:02] Discordant_Hats: That was a legitimately great video btw. Genuinely informative.
[2:37:05] Blighthung: Yei let's do this.
[2:37:07] eternitycrystal: @ver_flashbang he also wants a wow reset, so a loser take. I will ignore him, he has just braindead responses on everything
[2:37:09] chico_escuela: realistically an expenditure of the glyph system is what’s really needed.  I’m holding out judgement on the hero talents
[2:37:37] doomer_dan_: doomer_dan_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 5 month streak! twitch prime pog
[2:37:50] Vendrek: I am more upset about the fact that they are locking more talents behind specialization...
[2:38:06] holyzeke: omg don’t show it, I’m gonna get ill
[2:38:08] ver_flashbang: The frostfire talents on the other hand are 90% bangers.
[2:38:24] Barthvader13: I've read through the hero talents and have heard "class skin" what do you mean?
[2:38:27] ver_flashbang: so they might still get it right for priest
[2:38:52] eternitycrystal: dont pvpers want support classes? faster queue
[2:38:55] Blighthung: It's going to be very niche.
[2:38:58] AuroraFighting: Really? Why? My guildies have have loved Aug.
[2:39:00] Sharktribe: I want it, but i'm a noob idiot. I just think it will be fun
[2:39:03] frankenfoot5: I like support, I dislike button bloat
[2:39:09] Leterius: I enjoy playing Aug actually and would love to have more support options in game
[2:39:15] warrenny: i think another support class is good makes you abke to play dev
[2:40:12] AuroraFighting: I think a few more support specs would be good so there is flexibility in guilds. No one would *have* to be Aug if a Priest is willing.
[2:40:29] MrAxeffect: what does it replac ein holy
[2:40:49] Discordant_Hats: I'm a big lover of Divination Wizards in DnD, so I really dig the *flavour* of predicting the future to assist allies.
[2:40:58] cosmopanda13: sounds very clunky right now to me
[2:40:59] GameingAspect: PI ME?
[2:41:03] MrAxeffect: shows how much i play holy lol
[2:41:04] TheDeekins: I think there's a lot of well-earned skepticism that they actually will make meaningful changes to feedback
[2:41:13] oglevvyy: yeah its not even in alpha yet
[2:41:14] darth_nykal: RESPECTFUL feedback
[2:41:18] plopsmurf: when it apears on alpha they won't change it
[2:41:30] grin1ing: does blizzard seem more responsive now? comparing to dragonflight-alpha
[2:41:33] ver_flashbang: @TheDeekins Why though? They did for talents in df
[2:41:56] ver_flashbang: mages wanting RoP gone for example
[2:42:10] oglevvyy: @grin1ing i just wonder how war within will be with all the layoffs
[2:42:41] plopsmurf: Name one thing
[2:42:43] TheDeekins: yeah I will be happy to be wrong for being skeptical.  My tree (Marksman) had had zero feedback addressed and zero changes all expac
[2:42:47] warrenny: as long asthey listen to the right feedback. not super casuals or superhardcore
[2:42:51] AuroraFighting: I'm hopeful for Blizz's response after DF. Though, I have to admit, I'm still a little nervous. That things will backslide.
[2:42:58] dastago: i don't agree but i understand why people are skeptical - legion happened but then so did bfa and shadowlands
[2:43:01] clover_north: I'm not too too concerned about the layoffs, tbh it's kind of to be expected after a merger is completed
[2:43:06] eternitycrystal: layoff can be bad workers, maybe they will get better people
[2:43:08] plopsmurf: LUL
[2:43:22] obvious_sponge: the game
[2:43:26] frankenfoot5: Unrelated, Tali. But how do you feel about Ion H. as a game lead? He seems like a chill guy and I feel like end game raiding at least has been really solid under his tenure
[2:43:35] plopsmurf: i can't name anything
[2:43:35] Leterius: I cant even argue with you 2 as I avoided spoilers during alfa)
[2:44:23] grin1ing: @plopsmurf Soar? They changed it to be the proper dragonflying only this patch
[2:44:28] AuroraFighting: I feel like Ion is constantly vibing.
[2:44:32] ver_flashbang: I hope they will address button bloat in tww alpha though, mages have 8-9 buttons just for defensives right now lol
[2:44:43] Eregbueye: ion is pretty cute too
[2:44:54] icycoolfresh: I agree, Tali
[2:45:09] Engram08: We should be glad we got Ion
[2:45:15] grin1ing: he is cute, true
[2:45:26] Bu_Remie: there’s no way Ian would be working there with all the hate he gets over game balance and decision, if he didn’t love it.
[2:45:29] TheDeekins: to be more accurate, the MM tree has had minor tweaks -- but MM hunters have never liked the randomness of windrunner arrows and the main hunter tree has problems (like Sentinal owl) never addressed
[2:45:35] plopsmurf: I hate what Ion did to the looting and gearing system in BFA, was very bad decision from him. BFA would have been fine if we had for example DF gearing in BFA
[2:45:38] TheDeekins: some classes got a lot of attention to their feedback.  Just not mine
[2:45:40] HSAyril: No doubt he lives and breaths wow, just some really awful ideas
[2:45:48] kaijoe_: New drama post on Twitter: "The War Within is Dead. Taliesin suggests cutting Ion in Half".
[2:45:58] witchhobbit: @ver_flashbang mages def need more rework
[2:46:03] plopsmurf: BFA gearing system was super bad idea
[2:46:19] ver_flashbang: @ver_flashbang Just condense a few things into choice nodes and it would be fine
[2:46:22] grin1ing: poor cats
[2:46:25] HSAyril: Making Choreghast from purely cosmetic to mandatory for leggos in SL
[2:46:48] HSAyril: Heart of Azeroth implementation in BFA
[2:46:56] witcherpie: @HSAyril i mean you barely had to do torghast. Do it, make lege, ure done
[2:47:00] TheDeekins: and especially since MM has always been worse than BM literally all dragonflight, I'm not giving them any laurels for how they've handled my class
[2:47:01] MrAxeffect: alot of times you dont know untill you try
[2:47:16] Thoreya: then we got essences! lol
[2:47:26] darth_nykal: @HSAyril From it's announcement at Blizzcon 19 it was always they way to get legos. it was never only cosmetic only
[2:47:34] HSAyril: You had to run Torghast every week or you'd get left behind. That's not barely
[2:47:39] doomer_dan_: essences and corruptions were awesome and i'll die on that hill
[2:47:56] warrenny: no they sucked worse
[2:47:56] plopsmurf: what was wrong with keeping set bonuses, DF did good by reverting
[2:47:57] Yodamoo: @doomer_dan_ Yeah, If you could get the ones you needed
[2:47:59] witcherpie: @HSAyril nope, you had to do torghast weekly up until u crafted ur legos, and then ure just done
[2:48:02] oglevvyy: artifact weapons were the best
[2:48:04] ver_flashbang: Most azerite stuff being proc/stat stick based instead of actually affecting your spec/class sucked
[2:48:06] warrenny: if you didnt play 8.2 you were screwed
[2:48:08] HSAyril: I said leggos I'm SL when you asked for an example
[2:48:13] kerrekerra: I think im the only one that hated essences... made me feel disconected from my class! shooting lazerbeams all over the place lol
[2:48:31] doomer_dan_: @Yodamoo yeah you just go get it ez pz
[2:48:32] Enigmio: they game got too competitive...way too competitive for a mmorpg
[2:48:36] HSAyril: Ion definitely said at Blizzcon 2019 that Torghast would not be tied to player power
[2:48:39] ver_flashbang: @kerrekerra you're talking about corruption, not essences.
[2:48:39] Enigmio: and Ion is a know elitist so..
[2:48:43] databob1: Azerite armor would have been better if you chose your powers not farm the gear that has what you want almost like it's own buff tree
[2:48:47] Yodamoo: @doomer_dan_ Not corruptions
[2:49:03] kwazyk: @enigmio 100% agree
[2:49:13] doomer_dan_: @Yodamoo yeah i mean, you either get it or you don't ez pz
[2:49:25] Sharktribe: 7.2 was awesome *IF* you had a max level character of each class and could do ALL of the order hall mount quests like me, but i'm a certified freak
[2:49:32] darth_nykal: islands were terrible
[2:49:36] HSAyril: @witcherpie "barely have to Torghast" "have to do it every week". That's not barely.
[2:49:42] Yodamoo: @doomer_dan_ They were in a vendor with a, what, 3 week rotation? lol
[2:50:00] frankenfoot5: I didn't mind running Torghast once a week on classes that Torghast was fun for!
[2:50:02] holyzeke: torghast wtf lol
[2:50:04] Boatroad: was that for real your roof which got destroyed by a party?
[2:50:04] menzlo: Take your meds
[2:50:15] frankenfoot5: My issue with Torghast was that for some classes it was amazing and fun. And for others it was ripping out teeth and slow and awful
[2:50:24] kwazyk: competitive wow is not the WoW I loved playing from Vanilla
[2:50:24] plopsmurf: only World first raiders were spamming islands LUL
[2:50:27] menzlo: I mean torghast lol
[2:50:29] witcherpie: @HSAyril ofc its barely xD doing torghast for 15' once per week, is by definition BARELY doing an acitivity lol, AND you're done after you crafted it, like wtf? xD stop overexaggerating things u didnt like
[2:50:30] menzlo: Sorry
[2:50:31] ver_flashbang: torghast also had the same problem as azerite armors, a lot of statstick/proc things, not cool roguelite stuff
[2:50:32] darth_nykal: "prescribing content"
[2:50:37] darth_nykal: a play on words
[2:50:43] Leterius: Doing island expeditions achievements was a painful grind. Now it is borderline impossible
[2:50:44] menzlo: Ya my bad
[2:50:52] MrAxeffect: SHORT FORM COMMENTS ARE HARD LOL
[2:50:55] AuroraFighting: You said "Torghast". That's all that was needed.
[2:51:06] chaoticwonder: Torghast showed absolute disdain for casters.
[2:51:12] doomer_dan_: @Yodamoo yeah there was also raid, visions, and n'zoth assaults. it really wasn't as bad as people made it out to be
[2:51:15] holyzeke: torghast could’ve fucked right off lol
[2:51:26] doomer_dan_: @doomer_dan_ again, you either get it or you don't
[2:51:48] plopsmurf: BFA felt like doing a second job, DF is alot better with dailies
[2:52:02] TheDeekins: Torghast is actually a great example of the problems that continued in Dragonflight: some classes get a lot of attention and get to have a lot of fun.  Others don't get any love.
[2:52:03] Dazzaw17: i hated torgast to the point i didnt even bother getting my lego
[2:52:06] derbydave85: i like the state the of the game now, ive done what i need to do now i dont need to log in everyday only to raid/run keys if i wish
[2:52:07] MolotovMole: Ian is a legend
[2:52:09] random_redshirt: Both Island Expeditions and Torghast would have been much better with a rolling seasonal cap, like what we have now for upgrade currency in Dragonflight
[2:52:15] frankenfoot5: Yeah I'm guilty of that, Tali. I stopped playing after getting Castle Nathria AOTC until Dragonflight
[2:52:15] doomer_dan_: torghast was also awesome and i will also die on that hill
[2:52:17] HSAyril: @witcherpie you also had to do it again the next patch. Apparently your barely and mine are different
[2:52:40] GameingAspect: yup
[2:52:46] dastago: definitely was true for me
[2:52:48] ButterStains: really loving this music, is this wow music playing? or a diff playlist?
[2:52:51] TheDeekins: every time I boot up my Demon Hunter I get to experience a class with much more love than my MM main; true in Torghast and true now
[2:53:08] derbydave85: i was 1 quest away from finishing the rep grind for korthia and just logged out for 6 months i had enough
[2:53:16] Bu_Remie: torghast had so much potential to be a great evergreen,single player, end game piece of content.
[2:53:19] Yodamoo: @doomer_dan_ All with totally random chance...Many people were hugely gimped for up to 3 weeks, sadly. Was just bad implamentation...But the corruptions themselves were amazing once you had them
[2:53:20] ver_flashbang: No, it's 80% not even about the hero talents hahaha
[2:53:24] witcherpie: @HSAyril so what...? crafting your lege for few weeks on a 15' weekly activity, every 3-4 months, is a big deal? lol
[2:53:37] TheDeekins: guess that's the problem with having ~25 different specs, some specs I guess are just doomed to be left to rot
[2:53:52] ver_flashbang: It was about stuff being too complicated/overengineered and addon based for the most part
[2:53:57] doomer_dan_: @Yodamoo that's all i was really trying to say from the get go. silliness aside, the acquisition wasn't the best, but they were awesome and fun
[2:53:59] Thoreya: asmon just wants wow 2 and anything other than that he'll just hate on retail
[2:54:10] rws26: That's definitely true
[2:54:23] Toshiba16: He is a weeb now. He joined the dark side
[2:54:25] rws26: Kylie Jenner saying what's up in WoW
[2:54:26] HSAyril: So that's what I meant when you asked for an example. Torghast, SL leggos, Azerite Armor, Expeditions. Just major features in the game being disappointing
[2:54:34] GameingAspect: tht instresting
[2:54:40] holyzeke: he don’t even play wow at all
[2:54:43] Boatroad: 2044 Asmon runs for president :D
[2:54:48] eternitycrystal: it's a mmorpg, it's not a simple game. Go play final fantasy 48199102 if you want to play simple game
[2:54:50] Papa_Rowdy: the 2022 johnny depp phase he had lmao
[2:54:52] jimbowheat: Was 2017 Tali be much different to 2024 Tali?
[2:54:57] Eregbueye: true he has gone rally fast from "that's too easy" to "my head hurtst in a +20"
[2:55:05] Teranius911: too be fair, he is annoyed about everything XD
[2:55:06] Sarkans41: I wish hero talents were just cosmetic class fantasy instead of functional talents that have to be balanced.  Like just roll the functional stuff into talent trees
[2:55:08] plopsmurf: Wow is super casual friendly
[2:55:14] doomer_dan_: @eternitycrystal thats a silly thing to say. FF games aren't "simple" by any means
[2:55:15] oglevvyy: Hmmm, he said he wants more fun stuff in talents. (such as dks riding a horse in combat) Rather it being around competitive balance.
[2:55:36] ver_flashbang: People see the UI's of people like drjay and think they need that for their 20-22 keys, that's a problem..
[2:55:37] Thoreya: @Sarkans41 the reason why theyre not doing that, is to not redo a cata situation with overflowing talent trees
[2:55:39] oglevvyy: wow you're 40 u look 28
[2:55:47] holyzeke: asmon is gonna crash hard in the future
[2:55:51] GameingAspect: @oglevvyy lol
[2:55:52] jimbowheat: I think he went through some pretty horrible personal stuff in the last few years as well. Gotta make you grow up a little.
[2:56:09] frankenfoot5: When Tali mentioned he was 40 a few weeks ago I nearly fell out of my chair
[2:56:20] GameingAspect: @ver_flashbang you can tihnk things and do things both diffrent
[2:56:23] Nayruna: tali you're 40?
[2:56:26] Nayruna: dang son
[2:56:27] Papa_Rowdy: dawg your 40?
[2:56:28] witcherpie: it's true, you look like in your thirties for sure
[2:56:28] Trebled_Mind: that would be so nice
[2:56:28] tosk: @ver_flashbang People see the routes in MDI and think thats what they need in their +15's
[2:56:32] oglevvyy: @Papa_Rowdy ikr
[2:56:33] eternitycrystal: asmon can play another games, no one is forcing him to play wow. He is just toxic as fck and wow reddit is filled with his trolls reposting crap
[2:56:40] GameingAspect: you look 12 ?
[2:56:41] clover_north: He especially never needs to work again given his super frugal lifestyle. Props for not letting it get to his head like other super successful internet personalities
[2:56:43] rowanoaken: This is shocking to me
[2:56:46] Andersonmps: Whats your secret tho?
[2:56:47] Sarkans41: @Thoreya so now we just have 2(3?) talent trees instead is that really an improvement?
[2:57:06] Leterius: Next you say Evi is not 19!
[2:57:09] Leterius: liar!
[2:57:13] Papa_Rowdy: TRUE
[2:57:16] rowanoaken: My dad looked 50 since he was 3 and hasn't aged since so it seems common
[2:57:18] Thoreya: @Sarkans41 imo yes, bc they can just get rid of hero trees after War within and still have those trees still
[2:57:22] witcherpie: exactly, i roll my eyes so hard when hes talking about wow LOL
[2:57:25] Disjoint_Dwarf: The difference between you on Eastenders vs now is insane
[2:57:37] Yodamoo: I think Asmon is just sad that he can't like the game anymore cuz it's no longer the same game he loved
[2:57:40] eternitycrystal: rich streamer roleplaying a hobo
[2:57:48] Nayruna: Tali do you have a 7 step Korean skincare routine
[2:57:48] ver_flashbang: LuL
[2:58:11] frankenfoot5: He's been carried in raids and gearing by his community for over a decade. So I feel like he rarely even really played the game
[2:58:18] Halimain: He still made SoD complitely different than it should have started out as.
[2:58:22] kwazyk: @yodamoo true.  I myself are feeling this as well
[2:58:27] Enigmio: @frankenfoot5 true
[2:58:35] Yodamoo: @kwazyk Oh me too
[2:58:37] Greevers: I was shocked watching classic EastEnders and Tali turned up with his ‘08 haircut
[2:58:43] eternitycrystal: yea haha
[2:58:43] clover_north: lol
[2:58:46] rowanoaken: Omg lmao
[2:58:52] eternitycrystal: true
[2:58:59] dotonbori: Well, he's mentally ill too
[2:59:00] clover_north: thing is he has said he's content with that
[2:59:00] Daugen: I just dont think he wants to lol
[2:59:04] Leterius: I honestly believe he loves his room. He strokes me as man that gets used to his stuff
[2:59:05] HSAyril: I don't think he actually wants to
[2:59:13] Eregbueye: It looks like he doesn't mind tho
[2:59:13] Yodamoo: Damn...I'd still watch him if he cleaned his room lol
[2:59:15] rowanoaken: You say that, but would he want to? He seems content and he's got that $3 steak to carry him through
[2:59:16] HSAyril: His entire house is like that, always has been
[2:59:21] aeson_of_raid_sock: he also has to be angry
[2:59:22] oglevvyy: @Yodamoo i like asmons point in the direction of WoW's story. I don't like df story atm. prefer Legion/Wod themed stories
[2:59:23] eternitycrystal: @Daugen sure mate
[2:59:28] kilroy_xiv: I like to imagine he has a mansion he goes to when he's not streaming!  LOL
[2:59:29] Sarkans41: @clover_north a lot of people say theyre content with things theyre not content with to save face.
[2:59:33] aeson_of_raid_sock: and be reactionary
[2:59:35] jimbowheat: I live the idea he has a beautiful clean mansion and that attic room is like a movie set.
[2:59:36] Binge_Bear: He will drift back for the war within and then six weeks into it slate it. I mean that's fine its his view on things but I just wish his followers take everything as fact. Its like pay no attention the man behind the curtain its his brand nothing more.
[2:59:37] Yenma57: he for sure doesnt wants too, your way of living and his is just different, thats it
[2:59:39] Arlaeya: Nice wine and space banjo
[2:59:43] MolotovMole: his fall back is his starforge penis machines
[2:59:44] Eredith: I mean it could just be really clean filth lol. just for appearances xD
[2:59:47] GameingAspect: the room is the charter
[2:59:49] kerrekerra: I think he can clean up and still be as big! it might even make insane content for him to tidy up! i think ur wrong there
[2:59:49] tehl00py: hes tryna remain relatable to his avg viewer
[2:59:50] dotonbori: I think he's a mentally ill horder :(
[2:59:50] grin1ing: KEKW
[2:59:53] eternitycrystal: he is roleplaying a hobo, that's his character
[2:59:56] sapphire_rosa_: hell yeah your brand is drinking nice wine and having an incredibly gorgeous wife , YOU REALLY DID GOOD WITH THAT XD
[2:59:57] Leterius: both lol
[3:00:05] ver_flashbang: We will never really know probably xd
[3:00:06] frankenfoot5: I think it's the opposite. I think his character is filth and he is a racist lol
[3:00:12] SilverkissTwitch: Schrödinger's character
[3:00:12] HSAyril: I think your just getting the mixed opinion of the audience
[3:00:15] Greevers: yeah it’s his brand to be that nerd
[3:00:15] Blighthung: Well, speaking true. Let's respect everybody for what they are. I just don't like his toxicity.
[3:00:17] kerrekerra: Would make excellent content for him to make a cleaning arc :p
[3:00:17] rowanoaken: @frankenfoot5 I agree lol
[3:00:17] Nimsh: schoedringers amosgold
[3:00:19] Halimain: he's claimed he only needs $12k a year to live. In Austin, TX which is insane.
[3:00:33] GameingAspect: no
[3:00:36] dotonbori: yes
[3:00:39] eternitycrystal: yes it is
[3:00:41] HSAyril: It would be, yeah
[3:00:41] TheDeekins: @Halimain not so insane, he owns the house he lives in
[3:00:42] Sorin__: Man now i want some spaghetti bolognese and red wine
[3:00:47] Greevers: depression I think
[3:00:48] aeson_of_raid_sock: cheeky bastard
[3:00:48] kerrekerra: i disagree, i think he would get alot of money out of those videos and noone would care that he cleaned up
[3:00:52] Necoc: @TaliesinAndEvitel i wish i could never see or hear of Amon ever again
[3:00:55] rowanoaken: Yeah I think it makes him more "relatable" or whatnot
[3:00:57] Binge_Bear: It cant be healthy to live like that.
[3:00:58] dotonbori: considering most of his audience are degenerates I think they'd feel 'betrayed'
[3:01:04] clover_north: Devil's advocate: He's allowed to mature w age but he's not allowed to clean his room?
[3:01:07] GameingAspect: clean up room for content
[3:01:07] Halimain: @TheDeekins property tax in Austin is insane.
[3:01:10] Daugen: He still has stuff in his room that has been there for YEARS, I genuinly dont think he give a fuck
[3:01:11] eternitycrystal: if he gets a new house, new car new girlfriend a lot of people won't take him serious
[3:01:15] BillyTheK1dd: That mfker had roaches crawling on him fuck that
[3:01:22] HSAyril: I think it would be against him brand and lose him followers, but I also think that's just who he is
[3:01:29] aeson_of_raid_sock: imagine how many subs he’d lose if he washed his hair
[3:01:33] TheDeekins: @Halimain yeah but he's certainly not including that in his math
[3:01:34] Greevers: maybe he doesn’t want to change
[3:01:37] oglevvyy: naw, i think its just him. He probably has another house for girls or somethin
[3:01:44] krisz49: hello!
[3:01:45] frankenfoot5: There's this really interesting quote from Anthony Bourdain about this situation. He went up to celebrity chefs (Emeril-type people) when he began to be famous in the early 00s, and was like: "Why the fuck do you guys do this?" And they all simply responded "The beast needs to keep being fed."
[3:01:48] rowanoaken: Omg his brand consulters asking him to keep living in a public health hazard of a room
[3:01:50] Yodamoo: The most important thing to remember when Asmon says things about WoW, is that it's his opinion on how the game makes him feel.  He always disclaimers that he understands why others might like it, but it's no longer the game made for him.
[3:01:53] Enigmio: i think he just doesnt care...its not a priority in his life
[3:01:53] Zenitslav: He could probably do whatever he likes, but I tink there might be more than just brand that keeps him in that spot
[3:01:55] eternitycrystal: @McGreevers righhhttt....
[3:02:01] grin1ing: he might've convinced himself that it's okay to live like that, if it means that he can keep his internet persona
[3:02:03] Leterius: Real Asmon has hair!
[3:02:04] Greevers: isn’t it his mum’s house
[3:02:04] GameingAspect: tht would be odd
[3:02:06] Blighthung: Bullshit, anyone can clean the room. It's his choice to be in the middle of trash.
[3:02:06] Tenga66: Greenscreen into the attic
[3:02:07] TheDeekins: it's his childhood home
[3:02:10] Halimain: @TheDeekins he is. It was part of the clip he said that in.
[3:02:18] jimbowheat: That room is actually a green screen background
[3:02:20] doon03: overtime he has leaned heavy into business… you can hear it in how he approaches most subjects
[3:02:23] bottis96: i don't know
[3:02:28] Binge_Bear: Its a set i expect
[3:02:38] Harper_n7: Sounds like a coal miner LU
[3:02:42] HSAyril: I think he'd lose a lot of followers if he had a 2nd really nice, clean, organized room
[3:02:48] aeson_of_raid_sock: he has racks of Italian suits in his high rise
[3:02:53] Yodamoo: He probably doesn't even have the house anymore...He just had that room moved and attached to his skyscraper penthouse.
[3:03:02] witcherpie: nah he's just a teenager in an adult body, being filthy and living in dirt is not something he likes, but he can't take responsibility cause he's simply  a lazy kid inside
[3:03:05] TheDeekins: @Halimain so then I guess his property taxes aren't that bad then, if he mentioned it
[3:03:07] Halimain: I strait did a spit take when Tali said Downtown Texas.
[3:03:15] frankenfoot5: The big streamer guild in Classic WoW seemed pretty toxic/cringe
[3:03:15] Greevers: Does he like women?
[3:03:26] clover_north: If you get your takes from any streamer you're off your rocker, even the ones that focus on politics and those things
[3:03:39] Zenitslav: for a person who says he doesn't like drama he sure gets into it all the time
[3:03:40] Blighthung: @Halimain LOL spit
[3:03:57] the_howlermonkey: is the stream really choppy for anyone else other than me?
[3:04:00] funviking99: I hated that too
[3:04:02] Greevers: he’s pivoting to shock content
[3:04:08] sapphire_rosa_: ugh
[3:04:10] clover_north: Stream's fine for me @the_howlermonkey
[3:04:15] doomer_dan_: alot of people in this chat just saying mean things about someone they've never met who has never done anything personally wrong to them.
[3:04:15] oglevvyy: @McGreevers makes money
[3:04:19] the_howlermonkey: Thx
[3:04:21] Sarkans41: @frankenfoot5 I think a lot of streaming and streamers is toxic whether its toxic personalities or toxic parasocial relationships
[3:04:23] eternitycrystal: yea it's all a fake him acting as a poor human
[3:04:29] jimbowheat: You mean you dont end stream and tell Evi "I farmed the shit out of those guys"?
[3:04:30] warrenny: watching an abuse trial and siding with the abuser
[3:04:31] Kortinas: Streams good for me
[3:04:36] grin1ing: oooh, content
[3:04:41] doon03: he has embodied the type A moral of business
[3:04:42] HSAyril: You mean Amber?
[3:04:51] clover_north: So when do you pivot to become a credentialed expert in politics @TaliesinAndEvitel ? /s
[3:04:58] oglevvyy: @warrenny its johnny depp. A list celeberity everyone was watchin
[3:05:05] Zenitslav: spending 2 minuts on asmongold subredit makes me almost puke, It's so icky
[3:05:08] Blighthung: Ass mongold is a great guy I just don't like his toxicity  to the wow community.
[3:05:17] warrenny: @oglevvyy he chose the right person?
[3:05:23] holyzeke: masculinity is his brand and that trial was basically defending that brand
[3:05:24] Halimain: Big streamers and Youtubers gotta chase that algorithm money.
[3:05:38] warrenny: i assumed he suded with heard
[3:05:52] funviking99: his criticism towards wow even when@wow is good seems strange
[3:05:52] frankenfoot5: His "brand" is the stereotypical basement dweller
[3:06:04] grin1ing: your opinion isn't worthless for us, your viewers. we either like you or hate you, either way, your opinion is important to us @TaliesinAndEvitel
[3:06:11] clover_north: Yeah he's closer to cartman in the warcraft episode than Tate lol
[3:06:15] HSAyril: Imagine seeing the trial and still thinking Amber wasn't an abuser lol
[3:06:16] databob1: sounds like depression
[3:06:17] TheSonicDwarf: right, the people who Viking'd were very clean people
[3:06:29] eternitycrystal: do you have to take sides on that case, they are shitty people
[3:06:29] doon03: it’s depression
[3:06:34] warrenny: hes a slob but to the extreme
[3:06:43] Greevers: You’re in his age bracket ish and seeing a guy refusing to grow up, because he hasn’t had to, I don’t imagine he’s had office jobs?
[3:06:47] ver_flashbang: Going late to a doctor despite clear symptoms is so effing manly man
[3:06:52] witcherpie: oh he's definitely having mental illnesses
[3:06:59] Greevers: hard to see
[3:07:01] frankenfoot5: Losing 20/30 teeth is so masculine bro
[3:07:03] Yodamoo: @McGreevers He has...He used to work for the IRS
[3:07:08] funviking99: if he is depressed then there is another example that money don’t buy happiness
[3:07:14] RosieSeren: also viking was a job not person technically
[3:07:14] databob1: they built some of the best boats of the time
[3:07:17] Enigmio: 24/7 on a boat LUL
[3:07:19] oglevvyy: @doon03 if i worked from home and didnt need to leave the house or have people come over. i think id be pretty messy
[3:07:20] Leterius: Vinland Saga answers that question well
[3:07:21] Greevers: oh really sorry
[3:07:39] Katatonia____: Amon Amarth \M/
[3:07:45] Mewsette_kitty: anime is a great source for historical accuracy
[3:07:47] TheSonicDwarf: i was not being sarcastic, i was being genuine
[3:07:51] Leterius: daaaaamn thats some cool transmog
[3:07:51] Yodamoo: @McGreevers Yeah, I believe he has a business degree too
[3:07:52] clover_north: Personally whether the image is true he's frugal or not I don't think it's a bad thing that people are exposed to successful people who live well within their means
[3:08:06] warrenny: i need to finish vikings. s5 sucked
[3:08:14] witcherpie: swain's eye? league of legends refference in your near town? dayum
[3:08:16] oglevvyy: @warrenny ragnar lothbrok
[3:08:17] Atomicpanda: but there's a lot of swans though, right? don't ruin this for me.
[3:08:18] Saumur: @thunduz Ahh! I didnt even notice the gift, silly little lurker standing in the kitchen cooking, that I am. Thank you so much!! tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes
[3:08:23] siegeorc: most people don’t realize for Vikings is that they were far more prolific traders than raiders
[3:08:24] TheDeekins: actually just finished The Last Kingdom last night, Netflix's best show for sure
[3:08:25] KeyouiX: lots of people consider them the pinnacle of masculinity but they are said to care quite a lot about hygiene. or at least that's what i thought they meant
[3:08:26] ArcaneSyntax: @mewsette_kitty believe it or not Vinland saga is more historically accurate than most  fiction set in that time period
[3:08:27] funviking99: lost interest after Ragnar died
[3:08:28] warrenny: that’s awesome @taliesinandevitel
[3:08:33] Blighthung: He fixed only the half of the teeth that shows in cam, he admits that's lazyness, so what can we say?
[3:08:36] doon03: I spend a lot of time on my job dealing with people with a range of mental health issues, and his behavior tracks “depression” like behavior
[3:08:43] Yodamoo: Better to live in yoru own filth than someone elses
[3:09:04] Atomicpanda: i went to school with a norman castle.
[3:09:06] seanstrachan: I didn't know Bellular had his own tower
[3:09:15] eternitycrystal: killing enough people and burning villages will give you a civilization, that's how we countries
[3:09:17] HSAyril: I mean he does have depression, he's said and he's said mental health was why he stepped away from streaming for months and why he's not on his main channel
[3:09:24] grin1ing: rnd question, what languages do you speak?
[3:09:24] Blighthung: Let's talk about something else.
[3:09:27] Blighthung: Agreed
[3:09:36] MeggoArt: we can talk about the new wow book instead :3333
[3:09:37] frankenfoot5: Yeah let's switch topics. What sort of class do you want added to WoW when they eventually add Tuskars?
[3:09:46] HSAyril: Let's talk about wow tarot cards
[3:09:49] Blighthung: how many toons you have Talie?
[3:09:57] ButterStains: loving the music, is this a playlist?
[3:09:58] abraxis__: Before the normans and danes were romans, there were villas in britian with indoor plumbing and heated floors 2000 years ago
[3:09:58] ArcaneSyntax: Why are we talking about Vikings, asmon isn't a Viking, he's a skinny balding white boy from texas
[3:10:03] frankenfoot5: People are gonna look up a guide, pick the best one, and never touch the others
[3:10:08] eternitycrystal: @Blighthung toons? which era are you from mate, it's called alts
[3:10:11] Papa_Rowdy: same as covenants
[3:10:16] Sorin__: One is correct yea
[3:10:20] rowanoaken: Yea
[3:10:20] TheDeekins: the problem with Hero Talents will be the same as Covenants
[3:10:21] d0mezg4mer: its covenants all over again
[3:10:28] Atomicpanda: if only thy had just been cosmetic. ah well.
[3:10:30] Halimain: so which ones look the best, community?
[3:10:33] Leterius: I hate that. People force me to use talents I dont want cause its meta
[3:10:34] Blighthung: Yes ALts. I'm in CANDA
[3:10:34] butlerlog: the problem is going to be that you want to be a cool dark ranger but have to be a beast warden or whatever bc it deals 10% more damage
[3:10:37] abraxis__: it's all the illusion of choice (the hero trees)
[3:10:37] d0mezg4mer: how did they not learn this lesson in shadowlands?
[3:10:38] Enigmio: its so sa
[3:10:38] doon03: balance
[3:10:40] Enigmio: sad
[3:10:41] Blighthung: Canada. sorry.
[3:10:43] oglevvyy: yeah, always going to be a meta. idk how you get out of that
[3:10:44] ver_flashbang: Imagine frostfire will be the worst for both frost and fire, mages gonna riot haahaha
[3:10:44] runehako: dont you eventually get all as you level?
[3:10:48] witcherpie: @TaliesinAndEvitel why does it even matter what's best? I've been playing venthyr fury in SL for every single content, and loved the shit ouf of it
[3:10:51] Bambiprsi: thats exactly why we need hero /clas skins
[3:10:51] madmerco: as a balance druid my problem with them so far is "Why trees?" but we haven't see the other spec yet so....I'm not bothered until we know more.
[3:10:53] jimbowheat: Do we know how easy they will be to spaw?
[3:10:55] smop33: I mean, if you're high end you basically just play what sims best always
[3:10:57] eternitycrystal: hero talents won't be a big thing. We think to much about it.
[3:11:01] abraxis__: even class and spec tress have the same problem, everyone plays the same builds
[3:11:02] Bambiprsi: customization without player power
[3:11:05] Mewsette_kitty: talli do you watch and/or care about the MDI?
[3:11:08] dotonbori: Agree
[3:11:08] frankenfoot5: Honestly, I'm not chasing the best. I pretty much stop doing PVE content at +15s and heroic aotc
[3:11:11] edd_3000: It's a big pitfall with Blizzard I think. I noticed it in Heroes of the Storm too with the best builds in that game. Instead of buffing the other talents, they would just nerf the extremely strong one, making ALL of them bad. It's a great failing of Blizzard.
[3:11:35] Blighthung: What's wrong in calling toons your alt's. Is it really bad?
[3:11:36] ButterStains: if I’m playing it for two years, it will have an affect on me
[3:11:38] oglevvyy: @Bambiprsi what kind of customization is there besides mogs without player power :(
[3:11:38] dotonbori: Can I get a resto Shammy class skin where my water effects are Frogs instead, i want Raining Frogs, Frogmancer
[3:11:43] ver_flashbang: It'll also be interesting how they want to advance that into the 2nd and 3rd expansion of the coming trilogy, if they do that at all.
[3:11:43] Vendrek: They need to not lock hero talents behind specialization...
[3:11:44] Welshjemz: i'm already dreading those hero talents as a holy/shadow priest
[3:11:47] Atomicpanda: hero talents are a giant meh for me. more talents to keep track of. wheee.
[3:11:51] eternitycrystal: @Blighthung toons is old people talk
[3:11:55] doon03: when people say class skins what does that mean?
[3:12:07] Blighthung: I see.
[3:12:09] kwazyk: @frankenfoot5 same.  that’s all I need for endgame material
[3:12:11] madmerco: what is really making this any different than legion artifact weapons except it not being tethered to a weapon?
[3:12:17] eternitycrystal: social game? I play it solo for 10 years now. I have interacting with people
[3:12:17] saltygrump_: @doon03 i also want to know lmao
[3:12:22] SilverkissTwitch: @doon03 Changing your spell effects and appearance without any mechanical changes
[3:12:29] butlerlog: like if they announced just 2 hero class skins, such as dark ranger for hunter and necromancer for warlock, that would have gotten people way more pumped. there didnt have to be over 30 of these talent trees
[3:12:46] JPagan2323: honestly the way runes work in SoD should be how they take a look at the future of talents and similar systems. something easily interchangeble but with some variety that obviously has a best way to do it, but the variety allows for playstyles that still work
[3:12:50] sapphire_rosa_: and that’s why I’ve always enjoyed your streams and videos
[3:12:51] Blighthung: How many ALT's Talie have?. do I look cool now? lol
[3:12:52] witcherpie: @TaliesinAndEvitel people who chase meta instead of what they like are completely stupid
[3:12:55] holyzeke: divine feathers can fuck right off
[3:12:56] plopsmurf: people enjoy DF because others are saying DF is good
[3:12:59] Oldwizzard: thank you for that, so many games now being affected by this
[3:13:01] madmerco: true
[3:13:06] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to oglevvyy!  
[3:13:13] frankenfoot5: Tali single-handedly hypes me for WoW
[3:13:19] Brainjam: Yeah that's why I don't watch any of Bells stuff anymore, him being negative about wow stuff made me not want to play
[3:13:24] Bu_Remie: I think you shape the conversation plenty, particularly for players that aren’t playing cutting edge content.
[3:13:24] oglevvyy: yaaay ty ty
[3:13:35] sapphire_rosa_: @plopsmurf that’s not it exactly … it’s more that if people are generally happy, the FEEL of the community is nicer and you as a player are more likely to happier in general
[3:13:37] edd_3000: It's very difficult when you are denied entry to content based on talents, specs and even classes sometimes too. You feel forced into making these choices and playing these ways, and that might be upsetting for some people. It's just a strange ethos that has been cultivated by the community.
[3:13:39] oglevvyy: @AnAnonymousGifter Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:14:01] Sorin__: You can have frostmourne or the poop katana, but the poop katana parses higher sooo
[3:14:04] warrenny: we saw how “choice”, worked out in covenants
[3:14:04] HSAyril: There's always going to be a beat build, though, for any game
[3:14:05] frankenfoot5: Pretty much the reason I stopped pugging LMAO
[3:14:09] butlerlog: 100%
[3:14:15] Bu_Remie: I feel like this is something talk actually went through.
[3:14:16] DunesGames: #itsrudetobebadatwow
[3:14:17] ver_flashbang: -in a trivial 11 key btw
[3:14:20] AngryInternetCat: So accurate xDD
[3:14:21] eternitycrystal: well that's the appropriate response, dont see a problem?
[3:14:26] Bu_Remie: tali*
[3:14:26] witcherpie: i was literally using VENTHYR fury warrior on every single content in SL. And outdpsing every single pug I've ever joined. Ppl don't realize how stupid they are to follow meta
[3:14:27] Honorbound94: Nice Accolon impression hahaha
[3:14:29] Yodamoo: If you wipe cuz someone used a less preferred talent, I think you have bigger problems lol
[3:14:31] Scarto22: nah theyd get kicked out from the start lol
[3:14:34] dotonbori: Oh god this is whats going to happen to my Priest, I really hate the Oracle system so far...
[3:14:42] Tmicrochip: How WoWs Elitism shines so bad and how FFXIV doens't have that level is wild to to me. Remove DPS meters would be a excelent start
[3:14:44] oglevvyy: yeah, sometimes you look at someone talents in m+. and you just want to kick them
[3:14:44] SilverkissTwitch: LUL
[3:14:44] madmerco: I just love the passion.
[3:14:52] Sharktribe: lol
[3:14:52] aeson_of_raid_sock: I enjoy the emotional abuse
[3:15:22] plopsmurf: @sapphire_rosa_ True
[3:15:22] frankenfoot5: How many times will Blizzard need to relearn this lesson? PoroSad
[3:15:24] rowanoaken: How would you fix that issue? Apart from making it cosmetic only
[3:15:29] witcherpie: the problem is NOT with the game xD the problem is with the community of meta driven gameplay
[3:15:33] ver_flashbang: Counterpoint, did it happen that much if talents?
[3:15:37] ver_flashbang: *with
[3:15:37] ApolloRache: But i suppose you can change the talents in an instant?
[3:15:38] Tmicrochip: s
[3:15:48] doon03: we haven’t seen them all
[3:15:58] Vendrek: There is also the issue of RP affects...PvP selections of hero talents that is not available for their spec because it is only offered for the other two specs...
[3:16:19] funviking99: are hero talents covenants 2.0?
[3:16:36] DunesGames: hero talents are soulbinds 2.0
[3:16:44] Sharktribe: I'm excited for hero talents for RP and flavor reasons, but don't really care about high-end raiding, etc so
[3:16:49] kaijoe_: Fair. But the community has no clue what they want at any given time
[3:16:59] warrenny: we can freely change hero talents?
[3:17:12] Halimain: @TaliesinAndEvitel if it's bad you still win, because you'll be able to milk the obvious shit show fallout from it. So there's always an upside.
[3:17:22] funviking99: there will be a meta for sure
[3:17:27] Vendrek: @Sharktribe The hero talents I want for my warrior are locked behind the other two specs and don't have access to it.
[3:17:31] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel are you saying that we are the reason we can't have nice things
[3:17:36] ApolloRache: Why you think blizzard keeps doing this multioption stuff?
[3:17:44] Sharktribe: @Vendrek feels bad. Sorry choom.
[3:17:49] warrenny: oh right
[3:17:51] holyzeke: instead of this stuff why not if youre holy give you a few disc spells and vice versa
[3:17:57] warrenny: didn’t know that
[3:18:06] witcherpie: @TaliesinAndEvitel this is not the game's problem. This is the community meta slave driven gameplay problem. Blizz can't fix that, community has to
[3:18:17] frankenfoot5: It'll be a cold day in hell when the community makes me not play a Mountain Thane warrior
[3:18:30] Yodamoo: For what it's worth, I think it looks great and I'm excited!
[3:18:31] AlfredK: I just want class skins :<
[3:18:38] kwazyk: it would be interesting if Blizzard ran a expansion banning our ability to run dps meters.  to see if it would change invite status on players specs.
[3:18:40] Vendrek: @Sharktribe That is what I am getting at...RP may suffer and PvP selection is going to make the meta really small because of how they structured each hero talent tree.
[3:19:13] funviking99: has warrior been released yet?
[3:19:24] HSAyril: I wonder if Spriest is also going to see a change to PI
[3:19:46] knightjudicator: people do need to be fine with horizontal progression not buffing numbers up like another iLvl or 10 levels would
[3:20:04] knightjudicator: tho i guess this is both 10 more levels plus horizontal
[3:20:06] witcherpie: players should learn to play what they enjoy, not what the meta is for the next month, this is how you solve that problem
[3:20:22] warrenny: what if the community’s wrong on hat they dislike
[3:20:24] frankenfoot5: Speaking of the community, Tali, are we gonna get your impressions of each spec this expansion? <3 I literally check those BFA era vids all the time when I make a new character to see what to expect
[3:20:25] MeggoArt: archon
[3:20:32] seanstrachan: Close lol
[3:20:41] funviking99: @witcherpie exactly what I do , ppl keep telling me my talents are wrong
[3:20:43] MeggoArt: >:((( spriest PI should be self cast only
[3:21:03] dotonbori: I miss Unholy Nova
[3:21:13] ver_flashbang: @MeggoArt And get a edgier name and visual effect :)
[3:21:22] holyzeke: SL was so awesome lol
[3:21:22] DunesGames: Honestly I just hope the Evoker ones are chill and don't add a ton of cruft to the class
[3:21:24] witcherpie: @funviking99 the  majority does.. it just that the meta driven slaves are the most vocal about it, nobody literally cares if a spec gives u 5% more dmg
[3:21:27] dotonbori: Felt cool launching a big aoe bomb
[3:21:53] funviking99: @witcherpie true and I never change anything LUL
[3:22:10] holyzeke: meta can fuck right off
[3:22:13] eternitycrystal: meta is important, this is not fcking classic wow ffs. Why don't people get this?
[3:22:16] Brandishblade: there will always be (que lightning/thunder) a meta king
[3:22:18] tobyny: Best thing you can do on this game is find a like minded group. Then this stuff makes no difference
[3:22:28] Yodamoo: If you played Havoc and weren't Venthir you literally did like half the damage lol
[3:22:30] Caladin_the_Paladin: Because we wanna be the very best, like no one ever was.
[3:22:31] Atomicpanda: watch me as a i gravitate ha ha ha ha
[3:22:32] sapphire_rosa_: @tobyny yes this
[3:22:34] ver_flashbang: You would have to nuke the informational environment we live in to not have the meta thinking we do lol
[3:22:36] caradosailanthus: As long as a player isn't pushing the limits, it's fine to play something that feels better or more fun that isn't meta
[3:22:37] GameingAspect: yer viable
[3:22:45] warrenny: i played necro pally for first tier till i relented snd went kyrian🤮
[3:22:50] sapphire_rosa_: meta CAN BE important but it doesn’t HAVE TO BE
[3:22:52] doomer_dan_: @witcherpie to be fair, for some people it's not about being "meta" for some people that extra 5% IS what they enjoy. For some, pushing yourself to hit higher and higher numbers is their enjoyment of the game
[3:22:54] GameingAspect: all clasases are viable its a game
[3:22:56] witcherpie: @TaliesinAndEvitel this  cannot be fixed by blizz. I've been playing venthyr fury in all content in SL, and enjoyed the hell out of it, outdpsing in every single pug with off meta feels amazing
[3:22:58] butlerlog: for a very large part of the playerbase, being the most effective you can be IS the game now.
[3:23:04] antoxdd: if you cant get KSM or curve u must be handicapped
[3:23:15] sapphire_rosa_: @antoxdd that’s extremely rude
[3:23:37] warrenny: optimising your character is the game
[3:23:42] lellandria: No classes are viable. (Definitely not me being shit)
[3:23:43] sapphire_rosa_: disabled people play WoW too btw *waves*
[3:23:48] Yodamoo: @sapphire_rosa_ He worded it in a rude way, but he's not really wrong...
[3:23:53] frankenfoot5: Absolutely. Mythic raiding and very high keys you should be meta chasers because you need to optimize
[3:23:54] GameingAspect: i miss reforging
[3:24:00] Disjoint_Dwarf: This is why i play solo or with friends, i can play what is FUN (the whole point of playing a game). Following meta is no better that having to grind torghast
[3:24:02] frankenfoot5: Below that then please let me just play the more fun thing fellow pugs
[3:24:06] saltygrump_: @GameingAspect i also miss reforging
[3:24:11] caradosailanthus: As a feral main I do get a bit tired of the meta rule though
[3:24:11] sapphire_rosa_: not you Tali
[3:24:21] dastago: the issue is when people doing a +8 think they need to optimise for mythic raids
[3:24:24] sapphire_rosa_: I was talking about the person in chat saying something rude
[3:24:25] sapphire_rosa_: not you
[3:24:26] ver_flashbang: People had fun optimizing in decade old rpgs, the numbers game is a core aspect since almost forever
[3:24:27] Bu_Remie: they were responding to a rude message
[3:24:36] sapphire_rosa_: sapphi212Heart sapphi212Heart
[3:24:48] sapphire_rosa_: I know , I wouldn’t hang out here if you were
[3:25:01] frankenfoot5: No ableists here please
[3:25:04] alextheblight: ouch
[3:25:13] holyzeke: bringing talent trees back was a huge W
[3:25:18] GameingAspect: yer not cool bro
[3:25:19] kirbyd: I have low vision. People dont know but it affects my play
[3:25:23] HSAyril: Is that the elitism we were just talking about?
[3:25:24] funviking99: 2.5 half strikes
[3:25:25] Caladin_the_Paladin: I'm saving my half for something good...
[3:25:28] databob1: I'm loving BG3
[3:25:49] kwazyk: @databob1 same.
[3:25:50] sapphire_rosa_: I like the talent trees!
[3:25:54] Atomicpanda: yes
[3:25:56] Enigmio: i mean literally the same thing, everyone is running the same talent build
[3:26:00] sapphire_rosa_: I feel like there is a lot more freedom
[3:26:14] sapphire_rosa_: (outside of meta obv)
[3:26:14] JPagan2323: the talents could learn from diablo style talents
[3:26:16] dright424: I do feel like some classes are a bit too complicated, like enhancement shaman
[3:26:27] JPagan2323: where its abilities and subsets of talents for said abilities
[3:26:28] eternitycrystal: how is it complicated man? like do we want another crappy console game? every other game is simple and easy to play. I like the complexity of wow that makes it unique
[3:26:28] Enigmio: why putting in so much resources to build stuff like talent trees..and hero talents...if everyone runs the same build at the end
[3:26:28] doon03: they’re playing to much Lost Ark
[3:26:30] Enigmio: so useless
[3:26:32] Bu_Remie: it definitely feels too complicated from the perspective of a new player.
[3:26:36] witcherpie: the problem is that the meta driven players are the ones complaining, but they will be playing what's meta either way. The ones who want to have fun, will play what they want either way
[3:26:37] ver_flashbang: Button bloat yes, not necessarily complexity.
[3:26:43] funviking99: wait so we don’t get more talents in the main tree?
[3:26:43] tobyny: I feel like there just needs to be levels to it. I love my enhance which is arguably complicated. Whereas there are some specs that are much more simple
[3:26:52] caradosailanthus: Complication is a bit class dependent.  Ret Paladin is drool on the keyboard.
[3:26:55] warrenny: i change aoe build to single target like 3 change
[3:26:57] butlerlog: i found that people actually swap between talents quite frequently, even if the build as a whole stays the same
[3:27:04] Atomicpanda: i think it's all of it is just so convoluted. every system in the game is overcomplicated.
[3:27:05] redcrimtane: I love the talent tree system when i'm not playing alts
[3:27:07] icycoolfresh: I don't think they're talking about talents when they say it's complicated
[3:27:07] GameingAspect: yer
[3:27:09] Yodamoo: The bigger trees give some decent utility options, but there are basically still only a few viable options...A lot of illusion of choice
[3:27:12] dright424: Been doing heroic on my Enhance and playing that spec makes me a lot more tired than other classes
[3:27:14] tobyny: as long as people have the option to simplify the gameplay etc then it shouldn't be an issue
[3:27:17] Rabiahtaro132: Being a game about gaining power through one way or another, we tend to want our characters to be the best that we can make them.
[3:27:18] witchhobbit: that is what i have been starting to do too, it's fun
[3:27:18] doomer_dan_: I change my talent tree so much more now than i did back in the row-style talents days
[3:27:22] sapphire_rosa_: Boomie is complicated but I don’t care I love playing it so much even tho I’m not good lol
[3:27:26] Leterius: Meta became more of requirement for medium difficulty content not just top difficulty. Its hard to keep playing casual when you are forced into mold
[3:27:31] ver_flashbang: It's funny that even people like max say "do mages really need 6-7 defensive buttons?"
[3:27:38] GameingAspect: XD
[3:27:38] d0mezg4mer: the problem with hero talents is you get the whole new tree so the only decision your making is what tree to pick, and sims will decide that
[3:27:41] Enigmio: LUL
[3:27:43] Bu_Remie: devastation too
[3:28:02] HSAyril: I just hope they change Spriest AoE. Leveling and low keys feels awful that our only AoE is a 30s CD
[3:28:17] Toiarc: 1% drop chance mounts are making me be loser in other areas of life. Thats literally worse than slave labor
[3:28:17] witcherpie: ppl should learn how fun it is to out perform meta specs with off meta. THIS is where the fun is
[3:28:33] frankenfoot5: I feel like you should balance things around the average player experience, and punish people who are abusive/toxic
[3:28:36] Leterius: Ideal decision would be to make all talents equally viable but its not realistic
[3:28:37] dright424: I would actually argue that tier is making classes more complicated because it forces certain talent choices, often away from the simpler choices
[3:28:39] kwazyk: @witcherpie completely agree
[3:28:40] GameingAspect: yer why it rude to suck at wow good vidoe
[3:28:40] eternitycrystal: the losers who don't play wow want to make wow a console game so they can finally play it.
[3:28:43] Brandishblade: I just hate when when 20 passives are going off like in bfa. but i think theyve stepped in the right direction so far on lowering it
[3:28:47] sapphire_rosa_: oh yeah that is an AMAZING video
[3:28:55] MeggoArt: shadow is a mess all the time alas
[3:29:10] REDSUNDERGROUND: i play a prot warr  and a dev  evoker  both at  3k i.o i   feel like the meta things is  just  something  for people to  bitch about
[3:29:21] saltygrump_: honestly true
[3:29:23] Brandishblade: facts
[3:29:24] Rabiahtaro132: Based
[3:29:28] databob1: We're  all bellow available
[3:29:33] funviking99: true
[3:29:33] sapphire_rosa_: no I agree I am much worse than the average player clodagHeheheh clodagHeheheh clodagHeheheh clodagHeheheh
[3:29:34] saltygrump_: my sub is literally out atm and im still watching wow content lmao
[3:29:34] HSAyril: Finally, I'm the 1%
[3:29:36] tobyny: Trye. Hi fellow nerds
[3:29:37] Blighthung: Agreed
[3:29:37] frankenfoot5: In my defense, Tali. I'm not a WoW enthusiast, I'm a T&E enthusiast
[3:29:39] lastdeviljoker666: im not average
[3:29:39] tobyny: true*
[3:29:41] ArcavusX: i AM L33T
[3:29:41] doomer_dan_: @witcherpie i will agree with you there. I play havoc DH with an off-meta build and i constantly outperform people using the meta build because they don't know how to use the build correctly lol
[3:29:42] Theorof: Correct, I am below average 😂
[3:29:42] funviking99: I am average LUL
[3:29:43] aeson_of_raid_sock: my wife says I’m below average
[3:29:45] Welshjemz: we are all here because we are big old WoW nerds lol
[3:29:47] Greevers: we are special
[3:29:48] TheSonicDwarf: thanks
[3:29:48] stuartystu: I'm an above average WoW player as well as above average Driver
[3:29:49] jessbad: omg tali thinks im above average
[3:29:49] Rabiahtaro132: *blush*
[3:29:50] GameingAspect: thanks i work out
[3:29:52] icycoolfresh: tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill
[3:29:52] Toiarc: "average" player doesnt care about lore or mounts. Ban them all lol
[3:29:55] caradosailanthus: Aww thanks Tali <3
[3:29:57] Raghoulash_: LOL
[3:29:58] Arlaeya: I am disturbed by this knowledge but I accept it.
[3:30:01] Greevers: is Tali flirting with us?
[3:30:06] brennibrennt: Are you sure the playerbase does still contain so many normie players? Over time, only enthusiast stay
[3:30:08] jessbad: 10/10 take honestly
[3:30:08] sapphire_rosa_: clodagBlush clodagBlush clodagBlush
[3:30:14] madmerco: Thanks Tali, I needed that ego boost.
[3:30:18] eternitycrystal: ernBased we are cool
[3:30:18] ver_flashbang: Clearing heroic or getting ksm is already way above average
[3:30:19] Bu_Remie: Tali is always flirting lol
[3:30:20] brandorkian: wait the average wow player isnt obssessed like me!?
[3:30:20] RosieSeren: when I play a class I don't know, I tend to use the icy veins easy mode guide, just to get a basic idea of how the class works
[3:30:21] funviking99: KomodoHype
[3:30:25] witcherpie: @doomer_dan_ exactly... ppl think that a meta spec will magically give you the good numbers, when in reality playing an off meta spec CORRECTLY, can make u outperform every single average meta spec
[3:30:43] eternitycrystal: normy players can go and play console games, I don't get why they want to make wow shitty?
[3:30:57] kwazyk: @rosieseren same. then I just run off that spec to learn
[3:31:02] Brandishblade: ur 3rd or 4th alt gets the treatment of an average wow character/player
[3:31:04] doomer_dan_: @witcherpie yeah i mean, i don't think there's anything wrong with people playing a meta spec as long as they actually know how to play it haha
[3:31:08] sapphire_rosa_: yeah wtf there are so many!!! I know many!
[3:31:08] GameingAspect: hello 6 mounthers
[3:31:10] ver_flashbang: @witcherpie I'd agree with you if it wasn't for the fact that demonhunters are monstern in m+ rn LuL
[3:31:13] HSAyril: My girlfriend just started playing a few months ago
[3:31:14] tobyny: My m+ community comprises mostly of players that started in shadowlands
[3:31:17] stuartystu: I'm not even playing it xD
[3:31:24] sapphire_rosa_: welcome WoW babies!!!!! we love you!!!!!
[3:31:26] Rabiahtaro132: I've gotten multiple friends that "never play mmos" to join me in either WoW and ffxiv.
[3:31:30] runehako: poll time
[3:31:31] shruvenduden: I just turned 20 damn...
[3:31:32] brennibrennt: Pull them in the spotlight, right now!
[3:31:33] xd_pad: I started playing this morning. I played yesterday too
[3:31:33] Harai_Ulfsark: people need to check newcomer chat more, the other day we had someone there saying how wow is older than them
[3:31:33] RosieSeren: wow should be more new/normal player friendly
[3:31:35] thunduz: welcome to you people
[3:31:37] AlfredK: Dude, I wish I was under 20...
[3:31:43] Katatonia____: I started week 2 uk vanilla, zenedar server :)
[3:31:52] ButterStains: would love to know what classes new players are playing
[3:31:53] witchhobbit: i technically started in BC/wrath but didn't come back full time until shadowlands
[3:31:54] funviking99: *too much stuff* it’s underwhelming
[3:31:55] Orionm424: dude i am 40 years old and still playing games
[3:32:03] frankenfoot5: Katatonia is the hottest among us
[3:32:04] Halimain: I've met so many people on SoD who started playing with sod.
[3:32:05] Trebled_Mind: started my wow journey as a Draenei DK in Wrath
[3:32:07] madmerco: I was 21 in 2004...talking about wow's age makes my old bones ache.
[3:32:13] ver_flashbang: WoW gameplay is like a PvE moba, of course youngsters love that
[3:32:25] GameingAspect: its a game play the game :)
[3:32:28] kynlaeh: i’m 21 and have been playing with my grandpa and dad since Cata when i was a tiny child lol
[3:32:28] Hugo_az: @TaliesinAndEvitel i got a feeling classes are being balanced harder than usually because of the Esport style of WoW (MDI, AWC etc.) but that is just my assumption
[3:32:32] doomer_dan_: I started at the end of Cata and my most facepalm moment was running random dungeons as a DPS feral and staying in bear form because I thought I was stronger that way LMAO
[3:32:32] Littleoneone: im in newcomerchat and there is a lot of new ppl in the game
[3:32:32] eternitycrystal: @Orionm424 why did you say still? did you want to do something else?
[3:32:33] dright424: I do wonder if having DF as the leveling experience will help keep new players better than BFA
[3:32:36] HSAyril: Vanilla player here, and g/f just started playing. Feels like robbing the cradle (even though we're the same age)
[3:32:49] GameingAspect: tht does sound weird
[3:33:06] brennibrennt: There is something to sink your teeth in and brood about
[3:33:07] frankenfoot5: My genuine biggest gripe is the lack of clear enemy telegraphs in dungeons. Relative to other MMOs it can be very challenging to organically learn what each dungeon does and what you need to do
[3:33:09] eternitycrystal: It's live eve online, people will help you, but you have to do your own research
[3:33:12] Orionm424: @eternitycrystal nope i enjoy playing games
[3:33:15] SavageFromSpace: hell yeah I love keyboards
[3:33:15] Rabiahtaro132: Its satisfying then the understanding of the gameplay clicks in your brain.
[3:33:23] bedgard: It's a challenge to start such game
[3:33:39] Orionm424: and i think even if i am 60 i still playing games
[3:33:46] Trebled_Mind: my only gripe with the game is that I wish I had a better way to catch up on endgame story. I’ve been off and on during dragon flight and now I have no idea where I’m at in the story 😅
[3:33:48] ver_flashbang: It can also be a quit moment for many people though, like PoE talent tree.
[3:33:58] Yodamoo: So what you're saying is, It's more fun to play with when it's hard?
[3:33:59] GoldSmog: Most people just want to level and dress up a character. I think we forget what a small part of the community does the end game
[3:34:03] witchhobbit: that is how i feel about mtg and dnd
[3:34:05] Toiarc: I loved how back in 2008 you had to level up first in base classic game and get to know lore a bit. Now you are trown into random expansion you to game you never have played and wont get to know your races home town at all ?
[3:34:15] sapphire_rosa_: I have been playing for 6 and a half years and just started raiding regularly last year
[3:34:24] brennibrennt: I would put a sticker on every WoW ad "20 years of content!" :D
[3:34:27] bottis96: the recruit a friend could be streamlined better
[3:34:28] SavageFromSpace: It's the same for dota
[3:34:28] sapphire_rosa_: now I’m progging heroic with my community
[3:34:33] sapphire_rosa_: it’s fucking great I love it
[3:34:35] kwazyk: @eternitycrystal very true.   eve online is very rough at start, but very rewarding when you’ll learn how to economically sustain yourself
[3:34:47] Icepumpkin99: I think WoW is unnecessary complex. For example how the numbers are presented. You shouldn't need a bot to see what gear you want.
[3:34:53] GameingAspect: nice
[3:34:54] REDSUNDERGROUND: @Toiarc hence  thereason theya regoing  to  make dragonflight the leveling area  for everyone
[3:35:01] Brandishblade: this banjo music making what he saying way more inspirational than it is xD
[3:35:05] GameingAspect: explaioned it very well
[3:35:08] Hugo_az: i tried to go blind with FF14 but not long went to a page to see whats good and how to play it Kappa Kappa
[3:35:09] doon03: that pretend Pokemon game has that problem
[3:35:12] witcherpie: hero talents will be great, I'm sure of it, I loved covenants too. Can't wait to see the talents for slayer warriors
[3:35:13] eternitycrystal: @Icepumpkin99 bots?
[3:35:19] thunduz: mods?
[3:35:19] HSAyril: The new player island was an amazing idea. I taught the really basics of basics that I just assume people know. It was incredibly helpful to her just starting, whereas the starting zones teach you nothing about the basics
[3:35:19] sapphire_rosa_: @brandishblade tneEvi tneEvi
[3:35:25] GoldSmog: Just stop using bots LUL
[3:35:32] runehako: he means raidbot i think lol
[3:35:34] HSAyril: It taught**
[3:35:36] theszoti: this is completely on the community... no one is forcing you to use bots except other players
[3:35:54] GameingAspect: homework
[3:35:59] nedak001: simbots are soooo much fun haha I love using them
[3:36:04] Greevers: agreed
[3:36:15] Toiarc: I think its nonsense that all of the current expansions dungeons are not in current season mythic+
[3:36:18] witcherpie: the day i felt in love with wow was when how bad I was at the game and how good I can become
[3:36:19] eternitycrystal: people keep coming here with shitty assmon arguments and that is addons suck boo-hoo
[3:36:22] GameingAspect: legion started that
[3:36:25] ver_flashbang: You only "need" raidbots if you want to edge out that last .1%, otherwise the stat priority/bis list in a guide is good enough.
[3:36:25] witchhobbit: yeah realizing all i needed was wowhead all along...
[3:36:29] SavageFromSpace: im so old I cant  even remember why I fell in love with it
[3:36:29] tiyanigean: the day I had found something that was fun (raiding) that let me to do all those things, yeah
[3:36:29] GoldSmog: I played for years not knowing what the hell I was doing
[3:36:33] Arlaeya: As a friend said once to me, "I like my entertainment to come with a syllabus" and it is true for me too
[3:36:35] ApolloRache: @eternitycrystal addon are so good
[3:36:36] Yodamoo: I still have my Strategy Guide for FF7...Homework isn't new to games
[3:36:41] doon03: I agree 100%
[3:36:43] opidlx: I love addons
[3:36:46] eternitycrystal: @ApolloRache yea i like them
[3:36:46] Harper_n7: SOME addons suck
[3:36:49] ver_flashbang: To be fair, a weak aura telling you to press a defensive in m+ because 2+
[3:36:50] HSAyril: My fall in love moment was just walking through the Stormwind gates and hearing those drums roll
[3:36:50] ApolloRache: they are top tier user freedom
[3:36:51] tiyanigean: @GoldSmog hell yeah! ^^
[3:36:52] icycoolfresh: But wow is sort of your job lol
[3:36:52] Nulgar: addons are SO good
[3:36:56] frankenfoot5: I like how addons can customize your game. I just genuinely wish the in-game telegraphs of enemy abilities were clearer!
[3:36:58] GameingAspect: ppl has to tell you thottbot was thing by word of mouth
[3:36:59] Brandishblade: non required addons are aight
[3:37:02] eternitycrystal: without all the things addon I won't even play this game
[3:37:07] sapphire_rosa_: addons are important for me, not only for accessibility but also for fun
[3:37:10] tengold: still waiting for the 550 and 600+ mount achievement
[3:37:10] Rabiahtaro132: So many personal milestones when playing the game.
[3:37:14] shadowsliver24: The day I fell in love with wow was the first time I raided and it was AQ40 and it was epic.
[3:37:19] Bu_Remie: the problem with add one is wow doesn’t have in built systems to do what add one do.
[3:37:21] GameingAspect: ADDDONS IN MMMMMMMMY MMO
[3:37:22] theszoti: there are issues with addons but addons themselves aren't an issue
[3:37:27] ver_flashbang: Some weak auras/addons are very offensive though, like neltharion map or fyrakk macros :(
[3:37:33] Welshjemz: i think it finally clicked and i fell in love when i found there was an addon that made quest objectives show on my map so I stopped getting lost and could follow the story lol (<3 carbonite)
[3:37:35] Trebled_Mind: Carbonite was my favorite add on back in the day
[3:37:44] witcherpie: the myth that you need 25 addons to even play the game is what hurts the reputation of retail. It's CLEARLY false
[3:37:48] ApolloRache: @Bu_Remie But is not hard to get addons
[3:37:52] alextheblight: oh yeah
[3:37:53] HSAyril: Aww, I miss Carbonite
[3:37:54] kwazyk: as a hunter main RP character, addine like (per chat) makes my characters pets speak and interact with my character.
[3:37:59] alextheblight: never going back to non-modded Skyrim
[3:38:01] Rabiahtaro132: Playing world of warcraft has greatly increased my skill with other games.
[3:38:03] Sharktribe: I am literally modding Skyrim RIGHT NOW
[3:38:04] tiyanigean: @ver_flashbang thats more an encounter design problem. and a lesson theyll eventually learn
[3:38:05] tobyny: Jesus. Unmodded fifa career mode is a whole mess
[3:38:07] Halimain: I love addons for the ui, but i hate the addons that make the game too metrices, like dps addons and boss mods.
[3:38:08] JarJar_Brinkz: I modded sea elf into BG3 and i'm content with life
[3:38:08] kwazyk: err pet chat
[3:38:10] xaleen1: Aw man Carbonite love
[3:38:11] shadowsliver24: Mods aren't oldschool
[3:38:13] AngryInternetCat: Being a Space Marine in Skyrim is cool xD
[3:38:19] Hugo_az: what im not liking at the moment in the wow community is the constant bashing between Retail and Classic.
[3:38:21] holyzeke: wait till the day you find out holy is better than disc lol
[3:38:26] witchhobbit: @JarJar_Brinkz omg i need this
[3:38:30] knightjudicator: mods are so oldschool
[3:38:36] Yodamoo: Game genie?
[3:38:36] HSAyril: "Not super high player".. 3k rating lol
[3:38:47] JarJar_Brinkz: @shadowsliver24 Morrowind and oblivion beg to differ LUL unless that doesn't count as oldschool...
[3:38:47] knightjudicator: age issue sorry
[3:38:51] AngryInternetCat: Doom is what it is because of its wads
[3:38:53] Katatonia____: I have modded Baldur's gate 1 and 2 to high heaven
[3:38:58] madmerco: Race for world first (Mythic) for guilds named a bit like immortalis?
[3:39:01] eternitycrystal: lol
[3:39:03] Toiarc: I played C64 and I think wow is oldschool
[3:39:04] ravenstarr: lol
[3:39:05] sapphire_rosa_: XDDDD
[3:39:06] icycoolfresh: Aaaahhhhhhh
[3:39:09] bottis96: the average person without addons would not know there is 70% of the game
[3:39:11] GameingAspect: dial up is old school?
[3:39:11] alextheblight: LUL
[3:39:13] Trebled_Mind: those sweet dulcet sounds
[3:39:17] sapphire_rosa_: omfg what a perfect impression
[3:39:21] spettetgaming: press play on tape
[3:39:21] sapphire_rosa_: I’m dying of laughter
[3:39:22] alextheblight: REPAIR guzuDink
[3:39:27] tiyanigean: does blowing out the cardridge for my n64 count?
[3:39:34] Brandishblade: "get off ur game im waiiting on a phonne call"
[3:39:37] Toiarc: It used casettes and not floppy discs
[3:39:37] ApolloRache: wow that look laggy
[3:39:38] Littleoneone: OMG, i had forgotten that sound
[3:39:41] GameingAspect: leatix plus
[3:39:44] Halonen: I need to know, is the arcade machine in the backround real or is it a greenscreen of lies? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[3:39:46] eternitycrystal: Leatrix add so much stuff to your game
[3:39:46] holyzeke: with cassettes you had to leave the room when it was loading if u bumped it it wouldnt load
[3:39:50] Harai_Ulfsark: look at those addons playing the game for you
[3:39:50] Katatonia____: Paperboy really wasn't worth the cassette loading :)
[3:39:56] Mewsette_kitty: is this your Jeff foxworthy routine?
[3:39:57] thunduz: I thought we were your repair addon tneRedGear tneRedGear tneRedGear
[3:39:57] sapphire_rosa_: @gameingaspect YES LEATRIX PLUS IS BIS
[3:39:59] spettetgaming: Isnt repair built in
[3:40:04] JarJar_Brinkz: @haleych Fantastical Multiverse and 5e spells is SO nice, the fantasy is beautiful
[3:40:06] shadowsliver24: My first pc was a DOS machine LuL
[3:40:06] clover_north: There are real adults walking around in the world today who have never heard the sound of a dialup tone
[3:40:07] Theorof: If you never got a game in a book and had to type it in and save it to a cassette tape, you are not old school.
[3:40:20] brennibrennt: Tali, did you downgrade your PC?
[3:40:26] Harai_Ulfsark: i dont even know all the features from leatrix plus but thats a bis
[3:40:30] Welshjemz: i didn't even know there was a drragon riding addon lol
[3:40:40] eternitycrystal: 4090 woot, you are rich
[3:40:46] GameingAspect: have you enabled xmp for ram?
[3:40:48] Durwen: You are, however a steamer and video editor
[3:40:54] ver_flashbang: Valdrakken just kills your cpu lol
[3:40:58] thunduz: pretty basic setup is what you're saying
[3:40:58] Toiarc: All you need is gtx 1660 and 16gb ram + cpu thats i7 and made in last 10 years for streaming
[3:41:02] alextheblight: bit overdue, but thanks for the flick trick for races, by the way
[3:41:04] HSAyril: Let's see the rig
[3:41:07] eternitycrystal: does it cool good enough?
[3:41:10] spettetgaming: Like a bong/pipe?
[3:41:11] Nulgar: Corgo100 I had coded before, but my love for coding stems from creating a "user script" (back in '05, these were rather new) for deviantART, basically an addon for the chat, which got quite popular and gave me my 15 Minutes of Fame
[3:41:13] kso128: cpu absolutely kills wow when its crowded yes :/
[3:41:14] Halimain: 64megs. there's where your problem is.
[3:41:25] Atomicpanda: i have an issue with ibs too.
[3:41:30] Atomicpanda: oh obs nm
[3:41:36] Trebled_Mind: sick setup
[3:41:37] Leterius: valdrakken is not as bad as dalaran was in legion
[3:41:39] sapphire_rosa_: @atomicpanda clodagHeheheh
[3:41:41] madmerco: Tali just laying his e-peen on the table. we can only be so aroused. specs so sweet.
[3:41:43] Katatonia____: I think that 64mb of ram may be your weak link :p
[3:41:52] Trebled_Mind: Fractal is the best
[3:41:54] HSAyril: Let's see the rig!
[3:41:55] GameingAspect: no
[3:41:57] thunduz: I prefer using an aio because I know ill mess up something with water tubing
[3:42:00] GameingAspect: yes
[3:42:01] iamdrewonline: lol i still have a 1080 and plkay wow at full ultra
[3:42:05] PaSchTM: You DO need fractal.
[3:42:06] PaSchTM: :P
[3:42:13] tiyanigean: you could probably play retail ona slightly fancier microwave
[3:42:17] lastdeviljoker666: 14 fps
[3:42:17] brennibrennt: The most important question is: what's the name of the rig? ^^
[3:42:28] eternitycrystal: how much is the electrical bill with that toaster?
[3:42:30] spettetgaming: Cant go below 3050
[3:42:32] GameingAspect: no
[3:42:38] HSAyril: Lian Li Dynamic XL rig here. My dream case <3
[3:42:42] ver_flashbang: WoW is super cpu bottlenecked the more players are near, it's an engine thing.
[3:42:42] random_redshirt: How much does that rig help with the video editing?
[3:42:56] Toiarc: Honestly if I had the money, I would get something for 2-3k with 4070 and 32gb ram and possibly 14000 series intel i7
[3:43:15] thunduz: this is why RGB is importnat
[3:43:23] GameingAspect: i feel like your fourshadowing sometihng
[3:43:34] JarJar_Brinkz: The difference in quality from one mic to another once you reach a certain price range is so minimal
[3:43:41] eternitycrystal: @ver_flashbang I have the amd ryzen 7 7800X3D what bottleneck are you talking about?
[3:43:41] random_redshirt: SM7B is very helpful if you live in a noisy area and can't modify your living space.
[3:43:45] thunduz: yes and yes
[3:43:55] sapphire_rosa_: it’s because you’re a massive nerd XDDDD
[3:44:00] HSAyril: Post the rig on IG, Tali
[3:44:01] sapphire_rosa_: and that’s wonderful
[3:44:09] brennibrennt: We lost him to consumerism and capitalism Sadge
[3:44:13] GameingAspect: there ya go there the fourshadowing
[3:44:14] ver_flashbang: @eternitycrystal go to valdrakken or do a world boss with 40+ people and you'll see, your fps will tank.
[3:44:16] sapphire_rosa_: I am so happy with my new computer it has made everything so much better for me
[3:44:20] thunduz: yes
[3:44:21] Atomicpanda: moddin' makes me feel good
[3:44:24] MetaPunk: its not cause you need it, its cause you can have them :D
[3:44:27] Bu_Remie: inb4 all the chat mods go on strike.
[3:44:29] eternitycrystal: @ver_flashbang nope didn't happen :)
[3:44:32] SavageFromSpace: You could have been asmongold streaming in your own filth
[3:44:36] Trebled_Mind: you BUILT that wall
[3:44:39] Yodamoo: Yes
[3:44:40] JarJar_Brinkz: Did he NEED to put on clothes? NO
[3:44:42] Toiarc: Ofcourse
[3:44:42] JarJar_Brinkz: But he does
[3:44:43] thunduz: I think the wall is missing Sticker Elephants on it
[3:44:56] holyzeke: yea but you put that one brick out of place
[3:45:02] sapphire_rosa_: yeah as with addons, sometimes they are not necessary but they make your experience so much more enjoyable
[3:45:07] frankenfoot5: Tali, your brand is wine and good vibes
[3:45:09] eternitycrystal: but it makes you feel cozy and good
[3:45:10] Nimsh: still no yucca plant though
[3:45:11] tiyanigean: @eternitycrystal thats a 4.2Ghz cpu. has fancy 8 cores. but wow only uses 1.5 of them ^^ thats why its the bottleneck
[3:45:12] frankenfoot5: You can't change now. Sucks mate
[3:45:13] aeson_of_raid_sock: commence alpha male turn
[3:45:22] JarJar_Brinkz: It is a bonus though, it looks nice
[3:45:25] icycoolfresh: I just wish I could pug a normal raid without studying wowhead for 2 hours lmao
[3:45:26] brennibrennt: I mean there were enough people thinking the background is rendered LUL
[3:45:26] Trebled_Mind: speak for yourself. I’m solely here for the room content.
[3:45:28] Saiyori: I noticed the stained glass on the door from Aberrus on the weekly reset tho
[3:45:28] MetaPunk: new camera ? the quality on that stylish grey beard is through the roof!
[3:45:32] AlfredK: Your room looks sick though honestly. @TaliesinAndEvitel
[3:45:37] thunduz: Cheer100 holy fuck look at this guys streaming room. I think I am going to stay here and watch.
[3:45:43] mrmanno14: tali could you move to the side a bit pls trying to see more of that wall
[3:45:43] eternitycrystal: @tiyanigean why?
[3:45:51] ver_flashbang: @eternitycrystal I have a better cpu than you and go from 220~ to 140, what are you talking about lol?
[3:45:55] sapphire_rosa_: lol @thunduz
[3:45:56] JarJar_Brinkz: @Trebled_Mind I'm personally only here for the intro art, couldn't care less about the stream Kappa
[3:46:01] aeson_of_raid_sock: do I need such a large penis?
[3:46:04] Nulgar: Corgo100 Why do we do things? Because we can, motherducker.
[3:46:06] eternitycrystal: @ver_flashbang I have a gaming CPU mate
[3:46:16] AngryInternetCat: Oh no, don't flash us!! (Ba dum-ts)
[3:46:22] JarJar_Brinkz: Looks like a tnt
[3:46:26] mrmanno14: now show the sock hanging on the door handle
[3:46:35] Trebled_Mind: Living vicariously through Taliesin and his immaculate room.
[3:46:37] ver_flashbang: @eternitycrystal Are there non-gaming cpus? XD
[3:46:40] Toiarc: Yes you do
[3:46:47] Katatonia____: It's like the Batcave
[3:46:50] Atomicpanda: man, f my lights
[3:46:50] holyzeke: you’re really pissing off Greta
[3:46:51] Toiarc: You do you
[3:46:54] tiyanigean: @eternitycrystal because wow runs on a in house engine of blizzard that was made in late 90s early 2000s where people were considered hella fancy when their PCs had 2 cores. wows engine is ancient
[3:46:55] eternitycrystal: @ver_flashbang yes yours :D
[3:47:09] Blighthung: Ass mongold, uggg just let him be in his own puke.  Seriously who can watch that.  We love you Talie.
[3:47:14] Trebled_Mind: robeytAniPC robeytAniPC robeytAniPC robeytAniPC
[3:47:16] JarJar_Brinkz: What color socks are those? Is that blue and black or yellow and white
[3:47:25] brennibrennt: Point made clear tneWineTime
[3:47:25] thunduz: I mean it makes watching you fun. This is an adhd wonderland with all the lights and arcade unit playing in the background
[3:47:26] kwazyk: Talie’s Den of Mysteries!
[3:47:28] Raghoulash_: You're inspiring me now. Thank you. I want to improve my gaming.
[3:47:28] caradosailanthus: Ugh, theatre kids <eyeroll>     =P
[3:47:30] Cul_len: I like the chair. What is it?
[3:47:33] witcherpie: which realm is tali playing on?
[3:47:44] JarJar_Brinkz: Oh dear
[3:47:45] eternitycrystal: if cool house means you use cool addons, that means that asmon uses shitty addons that's the reason he is mad
[3:47:45] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[3:47:51] SavageFromSpace: woah for free?
[3:47:51] sapphire_rosa_: SOCK STREAM SOCK STREAM SOCK STREAM

[3:50:42] spooky_seraph: dang nice shoes
[3:50:45] squarepusher_: They're made of monkeys?? D:
[3:50:51] jimbowheat: @Atomicpanda Human
[3:50:54] kirbyd: I want the Burberry sneakers. $800
[3:50:58] Nulgar: @Atomicpanda that's why they last so long
[3:51:04] TadinGG: nice thing about good shoes as you have them repaired instead of replacing them
[3:51:04] JarJar_Brinkz: @Blloood Bruh, are you the Gucci representative????? LUL
[3:51:05] mrmanno14: hand made in a child sweat shop

[3:51:16] GoldSmog: Until ani colors on them or something
[3:51:18] SHammerdD: quality working boots cost 300. so 300 for leisure shoes is not a waste if they will last a long time
[3:51:21] Blloood: @JarJar_Brinkz I am just against people spewing BS
[3:51:27] eternitycrystal: it's free for those royals
[3:51:28] AngryInternetCat: King Charles xD
[3:51:31] JarJar_Brinkz: @Blloood How much did Gucci pay you to type that message out
[3:51:31] Blloood: when they clearly have no idea what they are talking about
[3:51:33] ramzie0: King Charles?
[3:51:33] Leterius: Never seen a single monkey wear em
[3:51:34] opidlx: I find it fun that you get those nice shoes for 375 and some people buy balenciaga for 5k ....
[3:51:42] tobyny: Tali next in linme for the throne confirmed
[3:51:48] Blloood: @JarJar_Brinkz dosnt matter if it is gucci, talking BS is talking BS
[3:51:50] random_redshirt: Better quality shoes last longer, save your feet from pain and can sometimes be repaired as well.  Good work boots will last ages with good care and repair.  You save money in the long run if you can afford the upfront cost, especially if you live in the US and have to pay for feet problems yourself.
[3:51:50] Atomicpanda: i know where my shoes come from. a sweetshop, sadly.
[3:51:51] HSAyril: Made from Czech monkeys
[3:51:51] eternitycrystal: damn

[3:52:00] mrmanno14: so it’s not made by children in a sweat shop?
[3:52:07] abraxis__: those are nice

[3:52:53] HSAyril: Made by monkeys, from monkeys
[3:52:53] sapphire_rosa_: I got a cedar wardrobe secondhand last year and it is the best thing ever
[3:52:56] Blloood: @JarJar_Brinkz I dont, i just think its wrong to talk BS about some brands with no substance to back you up, its just hating for hating
[3:53:02] mrmanno14: how can we send the Trump shoes to Tali
[3:53:03] DemonsoulGames: Man, people who haven't been watching T&E for a while are probably so concerned about Tali's priorities lmfaoo

[3:53:23] DemonsoulGames: that's awesome!
[3:53:32] nyrhalahotep: as sound an investment as antiques, items built slowly by hand with quality materials will outlast any expensive garbage people buy just for the name

[4:01:21] Nulgar: 4 Casts until the mob is dead, Classic is so easy tneTali
[4:01:22] Sharktribe: Much of the novelty of SoD is the new mechanics for the levelling dungeons... which they can add to the main game.
[4:01:30] JarJar_Brinkz: What level do you get Ultimate Penance in SoD
[4:01:35] Sharktribe: They can also just add heal mage, tank rogue etc someday to live and poof, we have all we need

[4:02:33] S3N71: No apology necessary, I too have three alts in P2, and two stragglers in P1 but with boosted XP ☺️
[4:02:37] Eredith: yeah 50% to 25
[4:02:39] alextheblight: can't recall tbh
[4:02:40] itsBunyan: @McGreevers It's classic+ basically

[4:03:20] sapphire_rosa_: this is giving me Hardcore anxiety flashbacks lmao
[4:03:21] clover_north: yeah priests are kind of unstoppable at the moment. Best healers in the game
[4:03:25] itsBunyan: Of course SoD is on stream when priests are OP LUL
[4:03:38] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL taking 3 damage? Is this normal

[4:03:46] S3N71: @sapphire_rosa_ Busy day at work, swift pint whilst I watch Talie and then home to get dinner on
[4:04:00] ver_flashbang: Imagine they would implement the surrender to madness mechanic as a rune somehow
[4:04:00] alextheblight: there is a particular mechanic priest has in SoD that is pretty cool too
[4:04:04] itsBunyan: Our shadow priest is top DPS by a wide margin in the gnomer raid
[4:04:05] alextheblight: (no spoilers)
[4:04:05] Eredith: mind blast, swd = dead ;p;
[4:04:06] AlfTheDog: Odd question, does your mic annoy you being in front you? always wondered with streamers etc
[4:04:07] Eredith: lol*

[4:05:06] Nulgar: didn't we just establish that addons are bad? tneTali

[4:05:56] xBigRobXLx: hey there was working in swansea uni the other day and couldnt help but think of you when i seen a biug sign saying taliesin in the student union :)
[4:06:02] ver_flashbang: Some classic mechanics like having innate 1% miss chance no matter how much hit stat you have are just weird
[4:06:06] clover_north: what's that item you just looted?
[4:06:06] alextheblight: do we backseat?
[4:06:06] Nulgar: No one in their right mind would want to play Vanilla in 2024
[4:06:08] Halimain: vermin are out front
[4:06:18] alextheblight: they're outside
[4:06:21] samuelashley1991: in retail you just go in that mine, dot everything with SW:Pain and move on hahaha
[4:06:24] lellandria: Labourers inside, vermin outside

[4:08:22] grumpy_dan: sorry
[4:08:23] Leterius: Bit or beat?
[4:08:24] HSAyril: Patient Zero
[4:08:25] Nulgar: @S3N71 yeah but from what I saw (which isn't much, I admit) it's mostly later spells added to Vanilla - e.g. actual Feral abilities
[4:08:27] cabeshpash: lol
[4:08:29] Saiyori: a moose once bit my sister...
[4:08:43] DR0G0TH: @Saiyori Is she still alive?

[4:09:15] naltxari: Off-topic question, at one point did you notice you improved as a wow player? (im not being rude its a legit question, huge fan here :p)
[4:09:15] random_redshirt: Yeah, kids can be bitey.
[4:09:43] S3N71: @nulgar Defo feels like that in P2 - I was a little disappointed, hope we resume exploring ‘what if’ in P3.  I’m currently tanking as Ret Pala
[4:09:52] thunduz: my oldest just had a basketball game and one of his teammates got angry and shoved them. the rage I felt lol went and spoke with the coach

[4:10:15] thunduz: yeah I need some new spells. This is not great lol

[4:11:21] witcherpie: inside the cathedral i  think
[4:11:21] lellandria: Every 2 levels
[4:11:24] Atomicpanda: trainer
[4:11:29] runehako: its usually every 2 levels
[4:11:34] runehako: and gotta talk to trainer
[4:11:38] stewart1957: Don't you have to visit trainer to learn spells?
[4:11:46] butlerlog: kobold workers are forming a union, go put them in their place
[4:12:09] CeasiusPls: same
[4:12:10] DR0G0TH: Same
[4:12:12] S3N71: @stewart1957 You do, yes.  And buy them too

[4:13:05] Rebonky: penance is so fun in sod
[4:13:05] Sharktribe: I still think SoD is meant to gently coax classic-only holdouts to learn the real game's spells, etc
[4:13:20] HolocronCoder: The line of hints at the bottom lol
[4:13:33] Garysteel1984: Tali did you get 3k ?? PogChamp
[4:13:40] Halimain: penance works a bit differently than retail.
[4:14:10] Garysteel1984: impressive!
[4:14:13] KatieRet_: darkheart thicket!
[4:14:35] Garysteel1984: so sorry i've not been around to tank much - been in office a lot lately
[4:14:38] S3N71: @sharktribe Wouldn’t be surprised if we don’t see runes in retail over the next 6 years.  Or maybe that’s the new talent in TWW, if that makes sense?
[4:14:38] Leterius: Does 3k give you anything? Like achievement?
[4:15:00] ver_flashbang: Bigger number better person LuL
[4:15:10] ver_flashbang: nothing else really
[4:15:36] Leterius: Then I ll happily remain at my 2.5k thank you, I will be smelly^^

[4:17:25] Greevers: wow

[4:17:55] JMcGhee559: i wanted to get to 3k this season but most of my team has stopped playing for the season
[4:17:57] rowanoaken: Oh pugging is a nightmare... I don't have a guild - I yearn for a guild :'(
[4:17:59] sapphire_rosa_: thanks again to Neek for the gifted sub! see you all soon byeeeee sapphi212Heart sapphi212Heart sapphi212Heart
[4:18:01] Sharktribe: I paid some teenagers to carry me through some high keys to just get the mount and be done lol
[4:18:19] Chris_M_C: I've pugged to KSM this whole expansion and this season definitely feels easier.
[4:18:22] S3N71: @sapphire_rosa_ See you soon
[4:18:46] Sharktribe: i'm an obsessive mount collector, so the limited time stuff stresses me out lol
[4:18:49] frankenfoot5: You're playing with Thunduz? Thank him for my gifted sub for me
[4:19:08] rowanoaken: When I was pugging a VP last season, I put <3 at the end of my messages, and I got flamed for being gay? I found it funny because they assumed I was gay before the possibility that a WoMaN could play WoW! It's nasty...
[4:19:12] thunduz: @frankenfoot5 you are welcome lol
[4:19:35] thunduz: Tali I gotta say I miss pushing buttons lol
[4:19:38] AngryInternetCat: I think I got a gift sub yesterday

[4:22:01] alextheblight: hmm
[4:22:03] thunduz: oh hearth! smart move
[4:22:07] alextheblight: odd
[4:22:11] ver_flashbang: you need the meditation buff on priest to learn most runes afaik
[4:22:16] butlerlog: yeah you need to kneel in front of a sstatue for a buff firsts or something
[4:22:21] Greevers: ppl have been better in pugs
[4:22:42] spettetgaming: Its worst around M+ 5-15
[4:22:51] Greevers: I just Q with my own key cos I never getting accepted Qing

[4:23:15] AngryInternetCat: I remember someone flaming me for using a warrior mace on my priest xD
[4:23:18] krisz49: /kneel
[4:23:20] Leterius: It was real fun, I only hope to never see Throne of Tides ever again lol
[4:23:25] AngryInternetCat: I was a noob

[4:24:00] reggiepowa: I agree, sl season 3 and bfa season 4 were better because of seasonals
[4:24:05] kuromebro: affix let everyone go bonkers

[4:25:27] Rebonky: kneel until you get the debuff
[4:25:30] krisz49: read quest text
[4:25:31] Rumble288: You need to be close to trainer
[4:25:31] butlerlog: there should be a statue or an altar you have to target before kneeling
[4:25:33] Rebonky: a few secs
[4:25:42] doomer_dan_: every season of BfA also had Tol Dagor, and fuck that place.

[4:26:53] alextheblight: OP af
[4:27:07] ver_flashbang: and it costs like no mana
[4:27:16] War_L0ck: you can kneel and have other priests pray on you to give your their medidttions..and you reciprocate (they kneel you target and pray). Then you never need to go to holy places.
[4:27:16] butlerlog: yeah runes are unlocked like shadowlands legendaries, they are just in your library forever
[4:27:42] fidget_cube: priestly tuition is costly
[4:27:57] alextheblight: yes. The mechanic is awesome
[4:27:59] fidget_cube: yeah you can collect different blessings that are needed for runes and stuf
[4:28:01] Garysteel1984: That's the trouble with exp bonus on classic, you're a lot shorter on gold
[4:28:02] fidget_cube: kind of a social aspect p neat
[4:28:06] Halimain: you got to enchant the penance thing on your gear.
[4:28:10] rowanoaken: Literally Catholicism - pay money to the church and get bonus powers!!!

[4:29:09] DemonsoulGames: Evi tuning in from downstairs like "this man..."
[4:29:11] fidget_cube: it feels more impactful when you can use from range and their swings dont interrupt your channel as much
[4:29:30] AngryInternetCat: Enjoy dinner!
