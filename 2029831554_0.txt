[3:59:26] Parazit_TR: I'm new to the game, is it normal for them to ask for 15k-20k gold to craft a ring? I would be glad if someone who knows could give me an idea.
[3:59:39] USForces: is enhance tanky now? I havent played since S1 and I feel like I remember them just falling over
[3:59:58] uncannysword: @Parazit_TR buy the reagents and use the crafting orders npc
[4:00:03] Kanooog: WOW just has sooooo much CC. Massive reason why healers aren't queing.
[4:00:32] uncannysword: @Kanooog healers aren't Qing because dps players are so zug zug and mindless now. that's what happens when all the good players quit
[4:00:33] drfeltgood: @Parazit_TR maybe at the start of a new season or xpac but not right now, I charge whatever the person wants to donate if they have all the mats
[4:00:55] USForces: @Kanooog I think it is because dmg is so high.. healing is just one long stress session... cc hasnt changed
[4:01:12] chrisiirc: are evokers getting buffed? mroe of them around atm
[4:01:23] Vultro: anxiety
[4:01:25] SatansHumbleGardenGnome: YEP
[4:01:30] drfeltgood: @chrisiirc pres is a little bit
[4:01:32] Kanooog: @uncannysword Yes and that wouldn't be as big of an issues if healers were stronger and not CC'd so often.
[4:01:35] callmeFROSTY2: bruh im' sweating but its like 80 wher i am
[4:01:39] shmeat: @Parazit_TR i pay 1k plus mats 5k min for decay pattern

[4:02:02] BeotchDaysha: is this the 90's channel mmuzak ?
[4:02:07] coffeexcakez: something like this with a few flex talents
[4:02:56] Kanooog: @USForces Yeah, I wish they would balance healers accordingly to the damage increase after people are in full tier / epics.
[4:03:18] uncannysword: CC sucks, but the reality is that the average dps is lining their healers and dying with all of their defensives up. that's why no one queues healer
[4:03:27] Vultro: Do you have your weps?
[4:03:30] chrisiirc: plus it aggravates carpel tunnel the ol fury warr
[4:03:36] coffeexcakez: go battlefiled commander
[4:03:45] Kanooog: @uncannysword That TOO, Exactly, and the DPS yells at  the healer for dying.
[4:03:53] about_13_unruly_goats: with gear and set bonus it's basically just a lot of grinding
