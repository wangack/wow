[0:41:44] Gnral: @Talason 100 percent true
[0:41:49] Toobswoo: Don't forget to say True to your own comments towelliee
[0:42:18] MysticalOS: the problem is blizzard doesn't understand moderation. they always swing too far one way
[0:42:29] MysticalOS: blizzard doesn't listen to feedback properly
[0:42:37] Talason: loot was easier this expansion if you pvped
[0:42:37] papaseat: FeelsGoodMan LOOT CYCLE
[0:42:42] itsAlz1: yeah hes Aussie
[0:42:45] Anguyen92ab: HOW DOES IT FEEL?  CAN YOU FEEL BLIZZARD'S POWAH?

[0:43:06] Gnral: can i go deep
[0:43:09] frostyplays0109: literally ran 4 dungeons got 1 piece of loot
[0:43:28] Gnral: sl is not enjoyable
[0:43:42] MysticalOS: they could have left reduced loot if they left bonus rolls and had a pve vendor comparable to pvp vendor. but they just went too far.

[0:44:15] MysticalOS: right.. blizzard didn't give people what they asked for
[0:44:19] CADZtv: correct
[0:44:36] swedishfishz: I agree with the valor changes loot is literally perfect
[0:44:46] MysticalOS: you give blizzard a problem and a solution. they go "ok we'll fix that problem but with a totally fucked up convoluted solution no one asked for"
[0:44:58] Anguyen92ab: @MysticalOS Correct.
[0:45:04] Talason: rbg gear!

[0:47:27] WallyJustice: They are both ass
[0:47:33] Anguyen92ab: I enjoyed doing WQs more in BFA.
[0:47:52] WallyJustice: WQs in sl are bad
[0:47:57] Solid0Liquid: I haven't played in a month because there's nothing for me to do that actually matters
[0:47:59] mcilreavey: its hard to play SL lol its not a bad xpac just dont enjoy
[0:48:07] MysticalOS: eneema
[0:48:10] swedishfishz: WQ's in general are bad content and im so glad i dont have to do em anymore

[0:48:44] WallyJustice: My fav tool album
[0:48:53] Gnral: wod and sl are almost same in term of content , wod had better story line
[0:48:54] WallyJustice: Aenima
[0:49:26] Glozki: he just said it they listned to the vocal "minority"
[0:49:28] CADZtv: we didnt reallt say that we said we didnt want system on top of one another and on top of another right
[0:49:30] WallyJustice: Mop and legion were as good as wrath tbc imo
[0:49:31] MysticalOS: TBC, wrath, etc worked just fine without endless grind. I don't think that's where probelm with shadowlands is. maw, torghast, dailies are abysmal failures. that's were problem is
[0:49:35] Anguyen92ab: It's been one mess that leads to another mess.
[0:49:45] Talason: he needs to turn your video up
[0:50:05] Plague_GG: they listen to the #nochanges crowd dizzySus
[0:50:19] swedishfishz: i disagree its rng crap, give valor uupgrades for raids
[0:50:22] MysticalOS: mists is my favorite expansion by far. best class design, great raids, and titanforging wasn't terrible
[0:50:31] MysticalOS: and valor points were at their peak
[0:50:33] Reckless_Monk: ???????
[0:50:33] Talason: lol
[0:50:36] WallyJustice: Mists was my fav too
[0:50:39] piratearms: gross
[0:50:41] Solid0Liquid: it's an eagles shirt
[0:50:42] Reckless_Monk: Jesus

[0:50:47] banditrox12: yes lol sadly
[0:50:50] Anguyen92ab: Oh dear.....
[0:51:02] neverbornlucky: Oh God you are missing it Towelliee. They are trying to teach Terry how to play Druid its funny
[0:51:05] WallyJustice: American Eagle outfitters kek
[0:51:06] WhataboutZoidberg: maybe just a glutton for punishment?
[0:52:07] KingSlayerYotam: KingSlayerYotam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:52:12] swedishfishz: Why not just do a valor system for upgrades instead? its so simple. get valor for boss kills and upgrad your heroic gear
[0:52:13] Moobot: Are you in need of a new or upgraded mic? Check out this sexy, professional quality Blue Yeti X WoW Edition microphone! https://bluemic.me/towelliee towPog
[0:52:21] WallyJustice: They need legendaries again to keep ppl doing raids
[0:52:31] WallyJustice: Dragon wrath etc
[0:52:32] Lexi__Marie: the cap should have been there week one 8.3 fullstop
[0:52:32] Talason: towelliee what about benethic gear
[0:52:34] Talason: that was a shit show
[0:52:36] MysticalOS: swedish, that's what mop did, literally all the systems in mop were perfect
[0:52:53] N_Tys: people asked for gear to matter again
[0:52:55] PapaPing1: @Towelliee  I remember getting my warfordge trinket
[0:52:58] kaihole: yeah why are there no legendary quest lines or attunements anymore
[0:53:07] Drogdorf: KEKW
[0:53:12] swedishfishz: @MysticalOS Exactly I despise this rng titanforge crap. Just let us earn currency for upgrading
[0:53:13] Moonphire: KEKW
[0:53:29] Talason: towelliee what about benethic gear??
[0:54:10] remedyt: it was a thing in some communities
[0:54:10] Talason: they did that because of conquest vendor maybe
[0:54:12] Gnral: @Towelliee true
[0:54:13] Lexi__Marie: i think blizzard looked at it says how can we make the loot less rng
[0:54:14] WallyJustice: It’s just fun that’s all it boils down too
[0:54:17] Press_Escape: what you talking willis
[0:54:18] Lexi__Marie: and then they overdid it
[0:54:19] mightybeanx: dont even know why they took the loot coins
[0:54:20] RedXIII: who ever asked for a re-roll token to be taken away. your moms a hoe.

[0:57:25] Lexi__Marie: im an achievement hunter, collector, i can give two flying fucks about gear i just want more anima per wq so i can power up my sanctum for collections
[0:57:30] A_Klimas: but a moment ago he said that was a vocal minority
[0:57:36] Broomba: True
[0:57:44] knigghtmare: i only raid and pz out lol
[0:57:48] swedishfishz: Yeah ill pass on that mindless crap
[0:57:53] swedishfishz: let me raid, key arena and peace
[0:58:02] Blasphehmy: I only world quest for World PvP lol
[0:58:02] knigghtmare: players are not proffesional mmo experts wtf
[0:58:02] mightybeanx: its the money man
[0:58:05] mightybeanx: money talks
[0:58:09] Felrane: 8.2 BFA was good. 8.3 BFA wasn't to me atleast
[0:58:14] MysticalOS: blizzard in general twisting feedback
[0:58:15] Solid0Liquid: all blizzard would have to do is look at the numbers
[0:58:22] neverbornlucky: I liked BFA what is wrong with me
[0:58:37] Darzetti_: BFA was solid i thought
[0:58:37] D3m0nHunt3r666: Its Towelliee

[0:58:56] WallyJustice: Bfa just everyone bought +15 carries so everyone was 485
[0:59:08] Lemonsqze: LUL
[0:59:18] eldercandle: lol
[0:59:23] Drogdorf: Flappy POGGERS

[0:59:32] D3m0nHunt3r666: mission table is the best for making gold
[0:59:38] crashoverride_gaming: Yeah I don’t think we honestly had “a choice”
[0:59:43] MuttonChopins: there are better WQs in SL than in BFA
[0:59:54] Estabanjuanjuan: I feel like they just aren't concerned about their core audience rn. they used this expac as like an experimental thing to see where they could pull a more casual audience.
[1:00:00] WallyJustice: I liked molten front in cata
[1:00:18] CADZtv: KEKW
[1:00:36] Solid0Liquid: your other left panda
[1:01:04] Larear: I was just disappointed by what shadowlands offered, it felt boring when it shouldn't. I have way more fun in EVE online
[1:01:18] Lexi__Marie: @Towelliee its bad that i would rather do islands than anything in shadowlands at the moment
[1:01:42] tekfury: hey islands is good money atm
[1:01:47] Larear: eve offers just so many things and if you don't like the one thing (anymore) just do another
[1:01:50] WallyJustice: Shadowlands will be good just not until 9.2
[1:02:05] Moonphire: If they implement soloable Islands in SL, it will be the most fun content added to SL
[1:02:14] Moonphire: which says something

[1:02:50] rynoh_2: pausechamp
[1:02:54] A_Klimas: but he's looking at it from a streamer content perspective. Sure a streamer gets content by grinding 100+ floors "for fun" but what would the average player do with that if there's no reward?
[1:02:58] crusadein: Wait, how much longer does this tier have again?

[1:12:25] CADZtv: makes sense
[1:12:26] CrunkyBrewster: I actually love the Maw despite there not having much in there. i enjoy the anxiety i get when i have Jailer eye 5 and everything is going to shit

[1:12:58] Hascius: It will only add the suffering we already have
[1:13:02] CrunkyBrewster: i only do the Maw once a week honestly

[1:14:51] Shakalu1990: The Maw is a shithole with no purpose.
[1:14:54] Lexi__Marie: perdition hold is the only part of the maw i hate
[1:15:29] TodaysTheDayEh: PepeLaugh
[1:15:47] CrunkyBrewster: I wish it was worth bothering with LFR honestly.
[1:15:58] A_Klimas: The worst thing you can do as a developer is make something that isn't fun to play. Why spend time and money developing it if it's not fun? Even games like darksouls where it has unfun elements and is supposed to be punishing still has payoffs that make it worth it.
[1:16:01] CrunkyBrewster: The Queue times kill me, so i dont touch it
[1:16:14] Gnral: remember n'zoth lfr @Towelliee
[1:16:36] CrunkyBrewster: bingo
[1:16:40] Shakalu1990: I think Looking for Raid is removed, but you can queue for Normal and Heroic Raids and Mythic being the only one that requires guilds. Also if you leave Normal and Heroics you need bigger penalties like bans etc.
[1:16:42] magemaster225: its not 9.0's problem that 9.1 was 4 months off course in development
[1:16:56] stratiss: agreed @magemaster225
[1:16:58] CrunkyBrewster: thats what i told my friend the other day. when im farming mounts and such, i usually do that at the end of an expansion
[1:17:14] stratiss: If content was developed faster this wouldn't be a problem.

[1:54:21] Tena992: @Phindrius  HOW though? How are they going to notice something that any other game these days wouldn't? A bug is a bug.

[2:30:34] vocalpenguin: beta is about testing not fun WeSmart
[2:30:57] stratiss: yeah
[2:31:07] Honvar: I kind of miss the strand of the ancients BG :)
[2:31:53] vocalpenguin: grinding levels isnt fun to me either way u slice it
[2:32:03] vocalpenguin: not lookin forward to it
[2:32:21] Vanhoek: maybe they want the leveling to take longer
[2:32:21] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:32:47] Vanhoek: It might have something to do with the 58 boost
[2:32:55] RyoxTheRogue: what would you say is the best alliance race for tanking? i think dwarfs right?
[2:33:05] Vanhoek: maybe they slowing down the leveling so peopel arent rushing to 70
[2:33:39] Doedje: I will rush to 70 anyway LUL
[2:33:42] danny_way: takes longer to get a bot going
[2:33:45] TheEnstraynomic: people were complaining about classic being too easy, so they're making leveling slower as a response
[2:34:03] Mooonwarden: yah i hope 70 takes longer than original
[2:34:21] ChimeraHU: why do you like to waste time?
[2:34:32] vocalpenguin: any mages selling ramparts boosts LUL
[2:34:41] RyoxTheRogue: @Zka77_Chimera if you enjoy doing something its not wasting time tho
[2:35:05] ChimeraHU: you can always level another one, but many people find leveling a waste of time before the game actually start
[2:35:13] Hikh_17: Are u having a hard time sleeping cause of how excited u are for beta? Been there :)
[2:35:23] xrandomdoodx: do you think all the BC raids will be cleared really fast when they release?
[2:35:35] NewWorldReign: Which expansion had faster leveling to you? @Towelliee
[2:35:52] ChimeraHU: first time leveling is usually good for sure
[2:35:57] Wubrew87: jesus
[2:36:02] RyoxTheRogue: i actually quite like leveling its relaxing and clears my mind from real stuff and im 100% sure im not the only one at that
[2:36:09] Luna3117: @Towelliee don't you just love to ERp ? by now?
[2:36:11] Kahoolo: Wait, you leveled 50 characters to 50?
[2:36:19] Doedje: It's Beta, these values arent set at all
[2:36:21] vocalpenguin: its stream content as well. i'd much rather watch u do it then level on beta myself
[2:36:22] Mooonwarden: i remember 60-70 took me a week in tbc, i hope it takes alot longer this time around
[2:36:29] ChimeraHU: obviously the xp loss is unintended
[2:36:33] DobChino: Do you think it would be better to go ret to level or level prot?
[2:36:36] Doedje: Theres a ton of things that dont seem right with beta atm
[2:37:09] Doedje: @Pantelijus I hear it's something like 0.85

[2:38:16] RyoxTheRogue: look at it this way: the longer it takes in beta to level the faster it will feel in actual classic LUL

[3:06:52] TheGaoSora: @Pantelijus I think it depends on how many minmaxers would return
[3:06:52] Lexi__Marie: look at you being react andrew (older react andy)
[3:06:55] Doedje: Not when you're making that kinda money
[3:06:58] BubbaChubbs420: shots fired

[3:07:59] MasterLuuk01: how do you like belf paladin atm ?
[3:08:01] Lexi__Marie: do you feel like you are in a gauntlet match while questing here
[3:08:06] No_Panda: @gooners Asmon can always react on Tows reactions LUL
[3:08:27] gooni_coyg: @No_Panda  That is true.
[3:08:58] Avinar: good Ole ring of blood soon
[3:08:59] KodyTheTyger: Just prepping you for Hyjal trash waves :)
[3:09:05] Machine42593: dungeon defender
[3:09:08] No_Panda: @pantelijus except pve aspect they don't
[3:09:10] LordOverflow: Done Ramparts yet?
[3:09:18] Avinar: they will nerf it for "balance and fairness" LUL
[3:09:20] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:
[3:09:20] Doedje: Arena probably will be
[3:09:42] Elichikaayase: wow is dead
[3:09:42] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:09:49] Wubrew87: D4 gonna be....uh a lot of viewers on streams
[3:10:03] elmokid1: I think classc hit a different spot for most people then tbc
[3:10:12] Glozki: I think the curiosity got most people for classic beta the curiosity isn't there yet for tbc
[3:10:18] bostonwinsx: Its cuz shadowlands killed it man
[3:10:24] gooni_coyg: Cause that was something new. TBC will go up tbh.
[3:10:26] Wubrew87: D2 remastered views.....MILLIONS guaranteed
[3:11:17] Avinar: I think it's because classic beta was completely "new" and tbc isnt new characters for us and such and a fresh start, but a continuation. also after what's happened in classic, less interest I guess? need more to do atm in beta and people
[3:11:28] Elichikaayase: wow is just recycled runescape
[3:11:28] Doedje: I think tbc is more common for most people since alot of people didnt ever play early vanilla
[3:11:37] UlyssesPaxton: Have tatman or shroud played yet?
[3:11:38] gooni_coyg: Ppl are used to Classic wow now. They already expect TBC and WOTLK classic. Before it was like a shock that blizz would do that
[3:11:42] Avinar: not really any world pvp going on too it's kinda dead open world on streams
[3:11:54] Niktorak: Do you think they'll add achievements and the collection tab w/ the store being implemented?
[3:11:55] Doedje: So vanilla has a missed the boat feel to it so alot of people were interested in it. Alot of people played TBC.
[3:11:58] LunchBoxFullOfGear: Are dungeons available?
[3:12:01] Elichikaayase: mop classic server bring it
[3:12:11] Glozki: I think alot of ppl that quit classic due to the toxic/gate keeping crowd. see the reactions so maybe they decide to stay away?
[3:12:15] Savagee320: They might change it up and add RBGs
[3:12:37] elvia_: I'm waiting for BFA Classic
[3:12:40] Elichikaayase: mop was the best
[3:12:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:12:44] Avinar: it was a fresh start for us in classic
[3:12:48] Doedje: yeah something like that
[3:12:48] ruan_vdw_za: @Towelliee hi, how does one get access to the BC beta?
[3:12:55] dHinTrO: tbc was a lot more about PvP then Classic ever was & it had amazing raid content
[3:12:57] stratiss: a shit ton
[3:12:57] Darkasi_: I think one of the major differences is that when WoW was released back in 2004 there are not a whole lot of videos, just short videos of back then. With Burning Crusade classic people kind of understand what we are getting and the beta is not going to get as many views as Classic did.
[3:13:06] TheGaoSora: yeah because people realized they're full of it...
[3:13:07] Glozki: scroll through any feed. vanilla purists chased tons of new players out.
[3:13:09] Lemonsqze: PogChamp
[3:13:23] elmokid1: @Towelliee Is beta more for testing bugs or promotional
[3:13:25] L4dy_Renegade: Cataclysm Classic Kappa
[3:13:30] A_Klimas: There was also a lot more drama for classic launch, you had the haters and you had the diehard folks. This time everyone is kinda on the same page it seems.
[3:13:34] elmokid1: Cant wait for BFA classic
[3:13:46] gooni_coyg: We cant get a lvl 58 booting blood elf when the TBC comes out right?
[3:13:50] Doedje: @Gloskki They still do that lol
[3:14:08] Doedje: @Gloskki You should see the amount of toxicity on forums about that boost lmao
[3:14:12] Avinar: #somechanges #DualSpec
[3:14:12] Savagee320: They had to share seal of blood
[3:14:17] Niktorak: no boosting blood elves or dranai
[3:14:20] Zonoxx_tv: People just enjoy being mad, it makes for easy content
[3:14:22] dHinTrO: no they didn't lol
[3:14:24] Glozki: oh yea they still do it. just like the ppl crying over boosts. inflated drama will lead some players to quit. it's just how it works
[3:14:39] DobChino: Is seal of command worth going for as a prot pally

[3:14:50] Doedje: Yeah thats so dumb
[3:14:53] TheGaoSora: ResidentSleeper
[3:15:02] Glozki: honestly it's hilarious to see everyone crying over the boost
[3:15:06] Doedje: They should have killed boosting at the start of classic
[3:15:12] Avinar: how much does that even cost on average? would be even quicker in prepatch
[3:15:14] TheGaoSora: SMASH!
[3:15:29] we_are_whomp: i think it'll be 4-6 weeks

[3:15:32] flanders61: @Towelliee Mara is the fastest if you want speed
[3:15:32] Niktorak: I bet prepatch will be 6-10 weeks
[3:15:36] we_are_whomp: don't see it being any longer than that
[3:15:39] captainhighdefinition: lvling as prot?! lol
[3:15:44] gooni_coyg: Really hope we can lvl in prepatch before 9.1 comes out.
[3:15:46] we_are_whomp: considering how other prepatches have gone
[3:15:47] guccigodx: Boosting is a Classic meta
[3:15:49] Doedje: Im just gonna spam dungeons with my prot paladin, the increased exp makes it very doable
[3:16:16] Avinar: I can't even really get a normal party for dungeons on classic. mostly boost runs. with horde and no paladins to boost yet and mages aoe capped, I expect the rage
[3:16:18] gooni_coyg: Towelliee is a prot - hammers up. Seeing him on that warrior in classic was not the same :D
[3:16:19] elvia_: when do you think TBC Classic is coming out
[3:16:22] elvia_: summer ?
[3:16:43] Zonoxx_tv: Does prepatch include the level exp reduction?
[3:17:00] Lexi__Marie: something something hobbs way of pulling
[3:17:00] TheGaoSora: tanking 6 PogChamp
[3:17:08] L4dy_Renegade: Clench thy buttcheeks monkaS
[3:17:22] KodyTheTyger: i leveled a mage on a 2nd account just to boost my own characters.
[3:17:23] Doedje: @Pantelijus The way people are getting boosted nowadays in dungeons by mages already ruined leveling for me
[3:17:23] Glozki: @pantelijus actually I do it's idiotic to believe a no boost would stop bots LUL bots exist on retail they'll be in bc boost or no boost
[3:17:40] Doedje: @Pantelijus if blizz fixed that, they can take away the boost. Otherwise I'm just gonna buy it
[3:17:47] campingking615: What character should I make to help the guild out

[3:17:52] Avinar: @towelliee how do you think tbc prepatch boosting on horde will be with mage aoe cap and no paladins until more people get them leveled?
[3:17:58] Niktorak: I kinda want to level in the world.
[3:18:03] Niktorak: On my blood elf.
[3:18:28] Niktorak: I buoght a bunch of cheap greens to equip when pre patch launches.
[3:18:35] Niktorak: Have weapons w/ firey alrady
[3:18:37] gooni_coyg: I hope we get a lot of time to lvl our blood elf in prepatch tbh
[3:18:50] Glozki: bro stop parroting reddit LUL bots will level up boost or no boost lmao it makes zero difference
[3:18:58] Lexi__Marie: word you hate to see "dodge"
[3:19:06] Doedje: He means mages might not be able to boost the way they do now since there will be an aoe damage cap
[3:19:44] captainhighdefinition: prot ccan aoe grind tho
[3:19:45] Avinar: yea sorry
[3:19:56] Zansteh: passive trait

[3:22:09] DobChino: Are you going horde in TBC
[3:22:15] Lexi__Marie: its what 30 pieces?
[3:22:18] Avinar: goblins are good at blowing stuff up after all
[3:22:19] Lexi__Marie: bug quest
[3:22:38] SilentVerity: They'd want one to come out while the other is in like, a bit of a content drought, right?
[3:22:44] x3onmi4s: pre patch is in may. they already said that.. if im not completly wrong

[3:35:43] CrispyTeve: Key was revered

[3:35:54] gooseboy429: wasnt there shoulder enchants from rep
[3:35:59] Goggetta: the problem with TBC questing is multiple quests send you to the same area in a zone, but they're so fragmented you only have 1-2 at a time

[4:09:21] TheGaoSora: Said wat?
[4:09:24] ILikeKillTheZombies: Shadowlands might end up like draenor, like they can cut it out in the middle and work on next expansion hard
[4:09:33] Whirdbistle: Have their been many bugs so far? I imagine there will be much less in TBC than there were in Classic Beta

[4:14:13] Scusio: dungeons drop gear?

[4:20:41] enseylol: @Towelliee As a feral druid, I got the Unstoppable Force with agi enchant in the TBC pre-patch back in Vanilla. First quest into Outlands gives a staff that had +AP in forms, which was better than my Unstoppable Force with 300-400g agi enchant - I was so mad
[4:20:49] cashaga: they said u can bring it all on one char

[4:21:46] we_are_whomp: easy
[4:21:46] enseylol: TF was used in start-raiding in TBC
[4:21:51] we_are_whomp: for tanks its even longer
[4:21:56] SilentVerity: Wasn't there a third, even more obscure site than Thottbot and Alakazam?
[4:22:00] Alitor1987: It should be the nerfed version of it if the patch is 2.4 so it wont last too long.
[4:22:09] Auira: thunderfury is still good in the early raids i believe
[4:22:22] cashaga: SSC and TK were raid barriers for avg guilds from i remember, alot of people stuck
[4:23:07] bottledxselfesteem: you rely on your wep in tbc to give you def raiting typically..
[4:23:22] SilentVerity: I remember my guild wanted to be doing Gruul's Lair every week but we just stopped doing it because every time we'd gear up a Mage Tank, they'd get scooped up by another guild
[4:24:20] Anbean: Anbean subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 84 months! 
[4:24:22] chrslp: wot
[4:24:28] SilentVerity: @OAMPlive Mages had to spell steal a buff off one of the Ogres in the Ogre Council. I think Warlocks would tame a demon as well?
[4:24:33] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:24:35] Hyvest: Didn't they call 1.12 1.13 in classic as well?=
[4:24:42] cashaga: maybe they bug fixed and QoL fixed it
[4:26:07] Jardon00: couldn't you stun them right before they died and they wouldn't explode?
[4:26:22] BTCBand1t: 2.4 tbc is its own seperate version, so the "new" tbc on the legion framework requires its own seperate version. Version control is a pita sometimes.
[4:26:36] vimie: going to have to fight for these mobs too in Live
[4:27:29] BTCBand1t: cant wait for all the guilds to lock off questing spots
[4:27:45] LAUCHS_mit_BAUCHS: @Towelliee do we know if they chance the mount prices for the normal riding mount (not flying) because my classic char doesnt have a epic mount yet, and i think i would safe the gold for tbc if they change the riding skill and mount prices ?!?! do u know yet ?
[4:27:52] Sh4nti: So it's going to be pre-nerf bosses? Even Vashj and M'uru? monkaS
[4:27:59] coldhandsbeatz: How long does it take from 60-70?
[4:28:06] mebetheking: Are you able to create a level 1 bloodelf paladin in the beta? @Towelliee
[4:28:46] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: DEW IT ! *palpatin voice*
[4:28:47] chillmatic617: chillmatic617 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:28:48] Auira: @LAUCHS_mit_BAUCHS yer we have seen via a metagoblin video that it could be cheaper to get the epic mount its self now, and in pre patch get the riding skill when the prices swap around
[4:29:18] chillmatic617: hey man, loved the video
[4:29:22] Sh4nti: monkaS monkaS guildkiller bosses
[4:29:30] chrslp: Do you think later in the beta they'll have premade 70s for raid/dungeon testing? Or are they wanting people to level to 70

[4:30:01] Doedje: Classic andy's can be pretty toxic
[4:30:15] Sepron14: What was the flying speed in TBC? does anyone know :O
[4:30:27] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: creat a lvl 1 belf  DEW IT!
[4:30:40] Doedje: Madseasonsvideo was disgusting imo
[4:30:44] Doedje: But thats just my opinion
[4:31:00] arcticanomaly: 150% & 210%

[4:31:05] BTCBand1t: Private server andys KEKW
[4:31:15] Collected1: you'd think they would have worked through these issues during classic
[4:31:16] merevin: the talk about boost?
[4:31:20] Doedje: The one about boosts
[4:31:26] Avinar: I wasn't a fan of madseasons recent where he goes my opinion yet then tried to pass some as "facts"
[4:31:31] Doedje: He brought up alot of invalid stuff
[4:31:43] Collected1: oh god this quest
[4:31:49] Collected1: i'm going to say that a lot during BC
[4:32:05] Collected1: did you do the poop quest already?
[4:32:14] Doedje: Yeah totally
[4:32:16] merevin: the botting part can't say its not true
[4:32:16] aj_20: No he used math to prove that boosts are a bad thing for the game and y’all are just too lazy to actually level
[4:32:31] Doedje: He even said he didnt enjoy creating the video and had to take a long break after it
[4:32:37] chillmatic617: the pie chart saying that leveling was 20% of the TBC experience in that video was a bit much
[4:32:40] Sha1yen: How packed do you think the layers are gonna be?
[4:32:41] ArcaneSyntax: honestly if the boost and mount keep the classic andys away from tbc classic than itd be a net positive in my book.
[4:32:45] acee626: Is there going to be LFG?
[4:32:49] dante4147: tokens!
[4:32:51] Doedje: I think he's just sad that classic vanilla is over
[4:32:54] arcticanomaly: what do you think about the boost? Asmon seems to hate it bcus bots but as someone that first played in tbc and has only just started in classic I am thrilled to be able to skip to bc if I wish
[4:32:57] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: madseasons did nothing wrong!
[4:33:03] sticksaredrifting: @acee626 tbc had an lfg yes
[4:33:11] nohemoglibin: if you played classic 14 years ago though, it can't possibly feel the same though.
[4:33:21] nohemoglibin: that whole sense of discovery is lost
[4:33:23] SilentVerity: I feel like the argument that the boost is a slippery slope is like...it's a slippery slope fallacy for a reason?
[4:33:25] acee626: oh I thought LFG came around in WoLK
[4:33:34] Stackamo: to play tbc from how it was originally for me would to have a 60 ready to goXD
[4:33:41] itsAlz1: i'm happy with the boost tbh. I'd rather have a char to play with my mates
[4:33:41] befruitfulandmultiply: could you please move the g fuel bar up, that I can see your rotation.
[4:33:58] Sha1yen: LFG started in TBC, in the form of a UI to browse. But it doesn't teleport you to dungeons or form the group for you @acee626
[4:34:10] Doedje: Yeah
[4:34:15] Doedje: Botters aint gonna pay 60 bucks for a boost
[4:34:24] Collected1: OAMPlive : But that's just a personal flex surely? I can't see another players /played time, only my own.
[4:34:34] Avinar: if anything we really need blizz to crack down on bots.
[4:34:38] Darkasi_: The problem with Asmon is he goes on and on about the "classic experience" but then takes gold, gear, etc. from viewers...
[4:34:38] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:34:39] Domi98_: they will if they make it back
[4:34:39] idenkaz_: bots aint going nowhere and we all know it
[4:34:48] acee626: @Sha1yen ah I see, is it going to stay the same way? or change it to be like it is in retail?
[4:34:49] arcticanomaly: when I first got into classic I couldn't stand the Drag of levelling. I would 100% skip to 58 to enjoy tbc, which I have fond memories of
[4:34:51] SilentVerity: towHAMUP
[4:34:59] chillmatic617: people with 20k gold in classic saying that boost bots will ruin the economy lol
[4:35:03] Gizimoo86: yeah 60$ can buy a lot game time
[4:35:05] Avinar: they claim "for time effectiveness, it's better to boost"
[4:35:14] Jardon00: honestly, as someone who didn't really buy into the classic hype train at first, and loves the time I spent in TBC, I welcome the boost because it allows me to play with friends
[4:35:22] Collected1: OAMPlive : yeah I see it as a personal choice really. Personally I'm in the "i want my character to matter" camp but i can see why others don't feel that way.
[4:35:24] Doedje: exactly
[4:35:30] Bonedit: when u can max level in half a day and multibox ur just gonna level like 5 characters at once in half a day
[4:35:40] Sha1yen: @acee626 Nothing confirmed yet. It will likely stay true to TBC version. So you have basically lfg channel in a UI that you can browse, and the summon stones gets activated for actual summoning
[4:35:51] Stackamo: they wouldnt care about a boost the programs they use levels them with no effort
[4:35:52] Doedje: BOT-tom line LUL
[4:35:57] Marah57: fuck bots
[4:36:05] acee626: @Sha1yen  for sure, thanks bro
[4:36:06] Avinar: "boosts invalidate my characters achievement" how? when there's mages aoe farming boosting and paladins in tbc
[4:36:08] PopeJonas: A guild is of mine was multi boxing 10 characters and sold gold to the entire guild
[4:36:12] PopeJonas: Guildie
[4:36:24] nohemoglibin: bots were a problem in vanilla.  this isn't new
[4:36:25] Collected1: OAMPlive : true true.
[4:36:25] Doedje: Absolutely not
[4:36:26] Coriollis: well since u get bigger rewards in tbc than classic , most likely is this gold issue will escalate
[4:36:36] Squirrel_nutty: i spotted 9 bots in alterac mountains yesterday night
[4:36:41] Avinar: all I know is I barely had 200g in vanilla and I got maybe 1k in classic and prepped lol
[4:36:52] elmokid1: @Towelliee What do you think about that discord channel trying to set up a fresh world?
[4:36:53] sticksaredrifting: people are calling the people who will boost bots. because they dont know how to play
[4:36:54] Frothiebeard: Stop being logical please
[4:36:55] Xenrawr: I think it's hillarious when people complain about paid 58 boosts, where every single person in classic levels via Maraudon and ZG boosts from 30-60
[4:37:04] Sha1yen: @acee626 the way it worked, was that you would sign yourself up for a dungeon filter, and add a short note that others could read. At the same time, you could browse everyone else currently signed up.
[4:37:18] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: HONOR SMOrc
[4:37:30] Sepron14: Did that just have PVP Resilience wtf
[4:37:32] Shrenko: good morning everyone towHAMUP
[4:37:44] crumpetslol1: resilience is also a tank stat
[4:37:45] Doedje: @Xenrawr Precisely this, I dont even think most of these complaining people play wow. Either that or they are the people who actually do the boosting on their mages / paly's
[4:37:53] Coriollis: has anyone checked classic AH to see the Naxx ones what they go for  ? thats a prty big indicator I would say
[4:38:16] drmabusee: is botting the only reason some people dont want the boost?
[4:38:19] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: resilience can make you crit immune also
[4:38:32] PoMsN: how to get to the beta ?
[4:38:37] bacsick: it should be resilience rating wtf pvp resilience
[4:38:47] we_are_whomp: it all depends on the returns the botters would get
[4:38:49] Sha1yen: The boosting thing as in insta 58, or the dungeon boosting meta?

[4:38:54] we_are_whomp: if the return is bad botters won't get it
[4:38:58] we_are_whomp: otherwise they will
[4:39:02] Avinar: ngl part of me wishes prot paladins would be aoe capped in some way or at least "if they are too high, no exp for lowers"
[4:39:12] arcticanomaly: do we know for sure there will be a prepatch to level BE and Draenai?
[4:39:33] Jardon00: yeah, if the boost was uncapped it'd be out of hand. but being 1 per account, I don't see it changing much
[4:39:38] Avinar: I think they will eventually uncap it knowing blizzard. nothing to go off on it but I have my doubts they will retain.
[4:39:40] arcticanomaly: awesome
[4:39:47] crumpetslol1: there are private servers that literally print there own gold and sell it and there are still people enjoying the game on those private servers people get upset over everything
[4:39:47] chillmatic617: I think a lot of the hyper emotional takes on the boost are just content chasing anyway, it's going to have literally zero effect on these people
[4:39:52] Sha1yen: prepatch is gonna be interesting. lvl 60 content with lvl 70 talent trees

[4:39:53] arcticanomaly: I can't wait to relive my first ever main char as a BE Pally
[4:39:55] Collected1: PoMsN : opt in and hope for the best. (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic)
[4:39:57] garlicco: maybe they should do it just for 1-2 week(s) at launch
[4:39:58] SilentVerity: I love that change. I leveled a Belf Pally when BC released and Azeroth was completely dead
[4:40:24] Clay2K_: around HFC
[4:40:25] Doedje: @chillmatic617 Yeah I have a couple of friends who played tbc back in the day and havent played classic vanilla but are really interesting in tbc classic
[4:40:26] Avinar: what if the boost was only with the CE? Kappa
[4:40:27] Jardon00: nah, the ones out near the wall
[4:40:33] CrispyTeve: I'm just upset that I need to level another paladin >.<
[4:40:37] geokouts: on the road down
[4:40:45] Doedje: @chillmatic617 I cant blame them for wanted to just pay for a boost so they can play with me in outland
[4:40:57] Gizimoo86: Hunters are really good in BC, so good for botting
[4:40:59] NiozeY: @Towelliee how is it to lvl as a prot paly?
[4:41:15] Sha1yen: CrispyTeve You mean you don't like to passively look at auto-hit animations for 40 levels? rooVV
[4:41:32] elmokid1: Do we know roughly how long it takes from 60-70?
[4:41:34] Jardon00: @Doedje  I'm in the that boat, I wasn't very interested in vanilla classic, but I loved TBC And want to be able to play with friends, so I'm gonna use a boost when it becomes available
[4:41:53] crumpetslol1: its like 6 hours a level for most people 3 hours if you are quick
[4:41:58] Clicklesly: How much gold did the premades start with btw? Just wondered how much you got by questing etc by now
[4:41:58] Doedje: @Jardon00 Yeah and it's just one, if you want an alt you're still gonna have to level it the old way anyway
[4:42:06] CrispyTeve: @Sha1yen don't remind me BibleThump
[4:42:13] chillmatic617: @Doedje yeah man and they should be able to, nobody wants to spend weeks leveling through dead content to join their friends
[4:42:22] Coriollis: a week is too long :)
[4:42:25] crumpetslol1: people who dungeon level will have to go back and grind rep
[4:42:28] Sha1yen: CrispyTeve I'm playing prot pala now in classic, i'll remind everyone I can rooH
[4:42:33] crumpetslol1: it may be inefficient
[4:42:33] Jardon00: @Doedje exactly.  and I don't mind that.  I played my pally for like 9 straight years when I started him in TBC, I want to relive some of that
[4:42:36] Zansteh: isnt that axe good?
[4:42:40] NiozeY: Spell dmg for prot is realyl good
[4:42:45] Asuo_: Can you still rush with attunements and stuff at the same pace as classic WoW?
[4:42:50] chillmatic617: @OAMPlive yeah for sure man, it's too bad
[4:43:11] crumpetslol1: level 68 you go start kara attunement
[4:43:17] Fades1209: how do you feel about the overuse of the word content?
[4:43:19] Xenrawr: hit is amazing tbh
[4:43:31] Collected1: attunements NotLikeThis
[4:43:55] crumpetslol1: i am content with the content
[4:44:09] Avinar: what bothers towelliee more is the term "influencers" Kappa
[4:44:12] pandag96: Wonder how close 9.1 and TBC will release
[4:44:14] Sha1yen: @OAMPlive You still wanna get to exalted with several factions, and normal dungeons only takes you to honored
[4:44:47] BTCBand1t: hc for exalted no?
[4:44:48] Avinar: I thought I remember you being bothered by it a year or so ago
[4:44:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:44:59] Nevariuss: ooo cant wait to do the Nagrand arena with my hunter for that juicy weapon
[4:45:06] crumpetslol1: really exagerate the flu in influencer
[4:45:14] chillmatic617: @Sha1yen grinding honored in dungeons and saving the quests for after is better, no?
[4:45:23] Avinar: self employed
[4:45:25] CrispyTeve: streamers are entertainers
[4:45:28] Johnd212: Just list Overlord
[4:45:39] Sha1yen: chillmatic617 Rep-wise it's more effecient, but it looks like it'll be much slower exp wise. So it's a tradeoff really
[4:45:45] Jardon00: CEO of Hammer of Fuck your Face Industries
[4:45:47] Stackamo: CEO of hammer squad
[4:45:47] Johnd212: OnlyFans
[4:45:47] Hangalik: self unemployed
[4:45:48] ILikeKillTheZombies: wow nerd Kappa
[4:45:52] crumpetslol1: radio host
[4:45:56] dreioo: foot model

[4:46:32] tigzie: lol BurkeBLack had the same issue
[4:46:35] BTCBand1t: 70yr old dinosaurs still employed at banks
[4:46:37] Doedje: Nah
[4:46:41] Johnd212: Oh they'll deny them. They don't care
[4:46:44] Lonelupus: depends on credit history savings etc..
[4:46:45] crumpetslol1: cryptocurrency stuff the banks
[4:46:46] Collected1: i would think the method isn't the issue it's the reliability of it
[4:46:57] Presidentslyngel: Good to see your still grinding towelli hammers upp
[4:46:59] Doedje: It's just alot of old people in these kind of structure so they might raise an eyebrow but not decline I think
[4:47:04] xaxel1991: banks dont give a shit what you do if you make more than 100k a year
[4:47:08] Sha1yen: OAMPlive Not saying that's what's gonna happen, just that everything is still very much speculation
[4:47:17] Asuo_: I have a friend in the banking industry.  Some jobs are considered short term high yield. Like porn makes a shit ton but only for like a year or two in the eyes of the bank
[4:47:39] drmabusee: on an isle
[4:47:43] Nertok12: he is at the far end of the void area @Towelliee
[4:47:48] CasketFreshx: its outback
[4:47:54] Gurtington_: I'm gona leave this here playing on my phone while I go to bed. this is relaxing
[4:48:14] geokouts: you summon him near some bones
[4:48:39] crumpetslol1: i remember this being a little hard
[4:48:48] frozenseal930: hes a giant voidwalker
[4:48:57] Avinar: 10.0 teaser PogChamp
[4:49:23] chrslp: LUL
[4:49:29] SilentVerity: Turn evil an add maybe?
[4:49:38] Jardon00: back when holy wrath wrecked face
[4:49:39] chrslp: Oh squishy adds
[4:49:39] Doedje: Doesnt hit very hard though
[4:49:52] josh8555: doing alot better now that you have better gear
[4:50:12] Doedje: Pretty cool name for some random quest mob
[4:50:34] Avinar: this tempts me to go back to the days of belf paladin that I made in late tbc
[4:50:36] Gurtington_: oh man I forgot about holy wrath. it's a cast spell for prot pally. it only does damage or also is like a taunt? I forget
[4:50:52] PrimogenitureJ: 100% a galactus easter egg
[4:51:03] Sha1yen: Pocketmitti just aoe dmg
[4:51:31] Jardon00: @Pocketmitti was dmg and stun to undead/demons IIRC
[4:51:35] CrispyTeve: BC was the pinnacle of WoW
[4:51:37] SilentVerity: Itemization across the board was such an improvment, and yeah blue rewards became much more common
[4:51:56] Gurtington_: OK thanks @sha1yen  . you can't block during a cast though, that seems like a bad idea while you're being attacked by a mob of 3-4 or more?
[4:51:57] Coriollis: nagrand rewards are supposed to replace aq40 gear I belive
[4:52:02] Avinar: that's why I mostly want to prep with gold gains over gear
[4:52:07] Sha1yen: Think Tier 2 lasts to about 64/65 and Tier 3 lasts to roughly 68 ish
[4:52:13] pesp0p: Some of the first dungeon gear in tbc is really good, especially with sockets
[4:52:19] Lonelupus: @Towelliee  welcome to 2006 lol
[4:52:27] Gurtington_: I'm a woltk baby BTW. joined mid wrath
[4:52:31] Coriollis: except legos and trinkets
[4:52:47] drmabusee: wasnt there a chinese guild killing illidan with t3 gear?
[4:52:59] Sha1yen: True, full Naxx on some classes lasts into tbc raiding
[4:53:04] Coriollis: like saph ench is still best for some classes all the way to t6
[4:53:05] Katzushirou: you can clear first tier raids with t3 easily
[4:53:13] Avinar: man I wish I had 1440p in 2006 LUL
[4:53:18] Clicklesly: That's cause they got TBC late iirc?
[4:53:33] Lonelupus: @Towelliee  the power of the peopels repblic is how they did it..
[4:54:22] Avinar: pvp gear from questing hmm would pass on that too

[5:12:21] KorbenDallas815: D:
[5:12:32] swampt1l: wait did hunters use melee weapons? LOL im lv3 and using one just curious @Avinar
[5:12:46] Madfrak: @warrenny  i could but i was horde and it means i had to pay for it, and didnt feel like paying for it :p
[5:12:50] Shrenko: AngelThump
[5:12:55] warrenny: He goes and pulls fro reaver 😂
[5:12:59] Juzika031: Opinion on BoS for survivability or BoW for mana? I kinda preferred BoW
[5:13:00] Avinar: @swapt1_ yeah you mostly used it for wing clip though or just when you want to save on arrows lol
[5:13:04] KorbenDallas815: time to throw PogChamp
[5:13:06] Nevariuss: will the be.imba website also comeback with TBC! :P
[5:13:10] Lonelupus: I forget does SoC hit nearby targets or was that later xpacs?
[5:13:39] Felrane: its it 6% reduction to damgage?
[5:13:41] Felrane: damage?
[5:13:43] Kovaltargunn: Righteous fury reduce your dmg taken
[5:13:48] swampt1l: yeah i dont have shit for ranged abilitys lol @Avinar
[5:13:50] Auira: it also gives damage reduction if talented
[5:13:59] felere: I know why Panda stopped playing classic in p2. The OCE community is giga toxic and made the game unplayable for him on a pvp server :c
[5:14:14] Coox69: mana seal? so you dont go oom in 10sec :D
[5:14:22] gravelzz: Also give yourself wisdom broskiii :D
[5:14:24] Lonelupus: PvP on a PvP server.. wut?
[5:14:26] Avinar: @swapt1_ normally won't. it's why hunters had a 1 button macro.
[5:14:27] SilentVerity: @Towelliee Did you use the addon that would calculate if you were uncrushable back in the day? It also had a button for Righteous Fury on it I think
[5:14:32] Avinar: was he alliance?
[5:14:48] Aaradin: he was horde
[5:14:52] Aaradin: he transfered a pve server
[5:14:54] sultan_of_sauce91: when i made my first toon in tbc i fell off the world tree and was stuck for 12 hours before i heard from a gm idk why i didnt just make a new toon

[5:15:41] geokouts: btw anyone here likes Blades Edge Mountains??
[5:15:42] Noshpan: Yeah, Argent Dawn & Frostmourne players are toxic AF. More toxic than Tichondrious players
[5:15:45] dreioo: @Pannekaker good.
[5:15:49] Sha1yen: Auira that's the one calculating defense cap etc right?
[5:15:50] Lonelupus: plenty of toxic scrubs on Aragul though
[5:16:01] Avinar: asmongold wants to go to pve but esfand wants to stick to faerlina and want to convince him
[5:16:12] dreioo: @Pannekaker it's more entertaining for viewers as well if it's not a perma grey sceen
[5:16:18] drmabusee: i was a pvp server guy back then, but now i enjoy pve server more

[5:17:04] Nevariuss: the BIG question now.... WILL ASMON PAY FOR A BOOST ON A PVE SERVER??? :O
[5:17:05] 無職提督: but isnt that all ASMG's content about? lol
[5:17:08] rocthenite: the advatise drama was some of the most toxic shit i seen from twitch wow section

[5:17:28] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  dont forget to use the item
[5:17:31] swampt1l: this is so weird LOL @Avinar
[5:17:33] rocthenite: a guy who's whole idenity was killing streamers for clot
[5:17:35] Avinar: I never really liked pvp servers even during vanilla and tbc. people were much more likely to be campers back then
[5:17:45] Sha1yen: rooD SANDWORM!
[5:17:56] TheCliffyShow: To bad they didn't add a red skin option to orcs.
[5:18:01] dreioo: leveling a fresh troll on a PvE server. SO relaxing and comfy!
[5:18:09] Avinar: @swapt1_ it feels a bit better in tbc with deadzone being taken out but yeah its different haha.
[5:18:25] dreioo: @TheCliffyShow yeah BC would had been the perfect time to do it
[5:18:48] elnipoo: is the beta open for anyone?
[5:18:52] drmabusee: leveling on a pve server i still get ptsd in stv -.-

[5:19:32] markyboy19899: When does the shield become instant again?
[5:19:36] Sha1yen: Should be a crystal that makes their soul appear to get killed
[5:19:36] Ablodi: then its a bug, you're supposed to use an item
[5:19:39] geokouts: Guys and Girls, go to Blizz shop and Claim the pet Bananas

[5:20:07] rocthenite: @Towelliee in classic i ran sunken temple old school for the first time in ages, they basterdised it in retal
[5:20:17] Doisel: oh yes thats true , they are fel orcs
[5:20:23] Jardon00: using the scryer is a later quest
[5:20:23] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  oh there used to be an item for the souls but i guess there is not any

[5:20:56] Lonelupus: is it worth it to use leather cloth SP gear whislt leveling pally or the DMG reduction on plate worth more

[5:22:10] gayfuI: will towlie be doing a beta key giveaway
[5:22:21] TheCliffyShow: I wish they kept the old Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep for the leveling then had the new ones for Cata levels. I miss the old SFK. It was so much better with all the worgen.
[5:22:33] rocthenite: i agree with preach raid video about MC, you can't give it slack for the "first raid" when BRD/spires/srathome exists
[5:22:34] Sha1yen: Didn't they do that for Classic?
[5:22:45] tillix_real: I always got inv as a veteran.. that's why I ask
[5:22:47] stratiss: they did a stress test for classic

[5:24:00] Shpetznaz: @gayfuI Diet where you just drink juice/smoothies you make
[5:24:04] Kromede: imagine simulating that with only 50 beta invites Kappa
[5:24:13] rocthenite: i am playing in sulfaras, it is a high pop pvp server with a pretty even split
[5:24:23] rocthenite: it gonna be fuuuuun
[5:24:40] DM_Hakai: Towe i think you're talking  shit more about SL than playing TBC
[5:24:45] Vanhoek: someone was saying it looks like the retail wow itemization when they did the item squish for SL
[5:24:45] Quirajin: @Towelliee you know maybe if there will be possibility to change ally to horde if i would like to play BE pally byt on classic it is not available?

[5:40:32] Noshpan: @Towelliee It's Comfy Camless Stream
[5:40:34] DelroyTV: good ol agi plate
[5:40:42] bruhSit_farmer: questing in retail feels way to linear
[5:40:43] josh8555: better to be comfortable imo
[5:40:52] bruhSit_farmer: and pointless
[5:41:08] SilentVerity: That agi is dodge
[5:41:09] Lonelupus: left hadn side of citadel
[5:41:15] Madhyama: just solo it lobosEZ
[5:41:15] Coox69: huge blue chest Pog
[5:41:19] Coriollis: just be a hunter 4Head
[5:41:21] geokouts: follow the road and then it is left side
[5:41:24] azetotwitch: The name "Ringworm" makes it sound worse then it is. Like a parasite.
[5:41:26] TheCliffyShow: @hjo1992 It's linear because there's an actual story to the quests.
[5:41:33] Lonelupus: in the basin  left hadn side before you go up
[5:41:35] Necrosack: that's rug came from a really big ass bear
[5:41:41] Lonelupus: to allaince BF side

[5:42:32] wisegato: hi, will people spam run the 1st hellfire dungeon overs and overs for exp farm ? sounds good compared to questing hmm.
[5:42:52] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  should be 61 yeah
[5:42:53] Vanhoek: yoiu can get into BF @ 60
[5:42:59] josh8555: Hellreaver was my favorite
[5:43:05] graysprings: @Towelliee feels good man
[5:43:06] bruhSit_farmer: peak wow
[5:43:14] Timozuna: worst thing about original tbc was there were waaay more players then mobs
[5:43:20] azetotwitch: @wisegato I think so. People will want to min max rep so they will run dungeons first and save quests. Can't take the min max out of the players. :p
[5:43:22] Coriollis: @wisegato xp from dungeon is dog so I wouldn`t bet on dungeon spamming unless 4 mages and a heaerl
[5:43:30] wigglenobber: im so excited to actually hit some raids forthe first time ever in burning crusade

[5:44:25] bruhSit_farmer: nah i get you, you deffs feel it different like classic vanilla for me new good memories
[5:44:50] duolmaercs: Is it just me...or is the background music cutting in and out?
[5:44:51] SilentVerity: Oh i remember this quest!
[5:44:57] PadidinJones: nope
[5:44:58] Timozuna: i was working from home for a good chunk of tbc leveled waay too many in tbc
[5:44:58] stephenkek: no I thing he just keeps going
[5:44:59] bruhSit_farmer: hope blizz keeps their foot on some changes too because tbc classic will be better than vanilla
[5:45:04] guni1980: Which professions are you going for?
[5:45:14] tillix_real: if you flagged once for beta.,then you ll be always in the '' list'' which Blizz uses for inv + extra accounts, I think

[5:51:08] gayfuI: it does entire server
[5:51:27] tauntpleas: yea at least it did on classic
[5:51:29] Jawis: it should be the server

[6:01:14] CrusaderNero: remember that guy who lvld only killing boars?
[6:01:21] TheCliffyShow: Was you playing "Live to Win" the whole time.

[6:01:41] kalmenus1: So you can say you were Boaring during that quest
[6:01:42] ChatankaGaming: Simping for Wrath is expected
[6:01:59] theoriginalzinng: what do you think the most fun dungeon/raid healer is gonna be in tbc?
[6:02:03] Quimby54: @ChatankaGaming ill suck dick for wrath
[6:02:18] Shrenko: wrath is easy mode
[6:02:26] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: PepeHands
[6:02:30] Timozuna: aww no trial love
[6:02:32] Layercake: Wrath till Ulduar was amazing
[6:02:35] bruhSit_farmer: northrend was nice
[6:02:36] DarkRhowen: so is ret broken like it was in original TBC?
[6:02:39] SlonkiJippi: @Shrenko OK, come back when you kill yogg 0 lights
[6:02:40] bruhSit_farmer: but yea tbc peak for me
[6:02:42] graysprings: I loved WotLK
[6:02:43] TheCliffyShow: But Wrath was the greatest expansion of any game that has ever existed...ever.
[6:02:44] Lemonsqze: ToGC POGGERS
[6:02:46] icipher_tv: Early Wrath was pretty nice though right? Before they put group finder in?
[6:02:46] Lyffie80: Ulduar hardmodes were really nice
[6:02:51] stijn0416: Why not?
[6:02:52] Raidr211: i think they will make some BIG changes to Wrath

[6:03:05] ivanmr122: wrath was the best expansion
[6:03:08] bruhSit_farmer: they re going to sell the shit out of wotlk lol
[6:03:12] 無職提督: yea, tahts for sure
[6:03:15] KC_GingerSnapz: whats wrong with the Dung Finder?
[6:03:16] bruhSit_farmer: wotlk mobilr
[6:03:16] ChristendomBaffler: I get the feeling they actually will wait or even downright reject it
[6:03:16] Alegnowar: i have no problems whit the dungeon finder
[6:03:17] L4gY: can't wait for BFA Classic, islands <3 KEKW
[6:03:23] Coldfire989: Wraith isn’t like retail is now at all
[6:03:39] Layercake: LUL
[6:03:45] Axeroska: wrath sux. lfd born. easy Naxx remake. 1room raid.....not even great ulduar cant chage that bullshit
[6:03:46] 無職提督: but i think thats gonna be the most popular one
[6:04:01] Dixietwist: icc was fun
[6:04:08] 無職提督: but hey, im a filthy casual
[6:04:09] ChristendomBaffler: hey, it was a bloody good joke if nothing else, which is more than you can say for retail
[6:04:14] theoneeleven: Wrath has some of my faveourite zones, and two of my fave raids
[6:04:15] 無職提督: i can dig it
[6:04:17] Ezekyler: de-fense, de-fense PepeClap
[6:04:22] ivanmr122: classes in wrath were perfect, every spec was so fun, and the pvp was awesome
[6:04:25] SSALZ_: I played a lot on wotlk pservers and i still do till tbc launch @towelliee welliee and I'm ok e waiting till last patch for classic, i just like the classes and gameplay more
[6:04:31] Layercake: The main reason wrath was the peak of subs ...was only because they made super accessible to everyone
[6:04:37] Spaarlampje: Grillcock Pog
[6:04:46] Sha1yen: da hell.. the ad just reset my volume rooWut
[6:04:53] hoodhussler: Bc was better I agree but dude uld was amazing ....
[6:04:54] graysprings: just got hit with 7 ads in a row wtf hahahahaha
[6:04:56] SlonkiJippi: The people who complain about wrath being too easy is also at the same time the people who do pet battles and mount runs on retail. There is difficult content for you but you're too shit
[6:05:08] bruhSit_farmer: don't forget tbc had the highest growth of any expect, wotlk peaked on the back of tbc
[6:05:13] bruhSit_farmer: expac*
[6:05:13] shocktorrent: so is that one button hunter macro going to be a thing, or did they fix/exclude those kinda macros?
[6:05:22] jkitchin75: @SlonkiJippi grow up kid
[6:05:26] Ezekyler: Wrath introduced heirlooms so the alt madness was possible in that expac
[6:05:35] SSALZ_: ye i pvp a lot on the wrath server i do now lol @towelliee
[6:05:38] ItzHimmothy: Wrath was the beginning of catering to casuals
[6:05:40] SlonkiJippi: @jkitchin75 Go farm some mounts dude
[6:05:44] Spaarlampje: Will wrath have aerial combat though :)
[6:05:53] SSALZ_: paladin is so fun in wrath
[6:05:58] TheCliffyShow: Wrath was when they started casually with game a lot. Allowing you to get raid gear with heroic dungeon tokens.
[6:06:01] GeoSourge: why is slonk crying 🤔
[6:06:02] jkitchin75: @SlonkiJippi i dont but thanks kid
[6:06:11] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:06:11] Coriollis: dat mp5 Kreygasm
[6:06:31] Gizimoo86: yeah actual paladin leveling gear
[6:06:37] ivanmr122: what level can you buy flying in tbc
[6:06:44] arcticanomaly: I think less catering to casuals and more evolving with the times.
[6:06:46] theoriginalzinng: attack of the helboars
[6:07:00] SlonkiJippi: @jkitchin75 Sure you dont, classic to call someone else a "kid" when you dont have anything better to say. You know its true but too bad to admit
[6:07:10] Krigsgurun: @ivanmr122 68 low flying, 70 expert
[6:07:16] ItzHimmothy: That casualness killed the magic or original community
[6:07:21] GeoSourge: slonk is still crying 🤔
[6:07:22] ChristendomBaffler: the thing about catering to casuals is that, compared to anything that came afterwards, they still eventually found a way to make hardcore content rewarding (though idk if naxx being pathetic was worse than ToGC being a tragic mess)
[6:07:29] ItzHimmothy: Of*
[6:07:30] Spaarlampje: Same with dungeon finder bags
[6:07:34] Sha1yen: @Krigsgurun incorrect. 68 is only druids. everyone else get flying at 70
[6:07:45] theoriginalzinng: we got ourselves a toxic wrath baby here boys
[6:07:52] Quimby54: Bring back the 1 mob slam WQs, not these multiple step ones
[6:07:54] Daishuki: Towelie you da man
[6:07:55] TheCliffyShow: @arcticanomaly Evolving to gamers becoming lazy, entitled asshats?
[6:07:58] Ezekyler: Bullying Grillok FeelsBadMan
[6:08:05] Krigsgurun: @sha1yen  ah alright 🤙 but druid have quest for it right? fly form?
[6:08:09] Gizimoo86: More fun to just farm mobs in classic or BC than world quests
[6:08:15] Sha1yen: @Krigsgurun yes
[6:08:30] Sha1yen: @Krigsgurun short quest for 68, long one at 70 for swift form
[6:08:30] Axeroska: is there lvl cap in beta or is all the way to 70allready?
[6:08:30] CrusaderNero: WQs in SL? Literally a pile of shit
[6:08:41] Ezekyler: Druids selling runs to Anzu for the mount
[6:08:46] jkitchin75: @SlonkiJippi look i dont farm mount cos i cant be botherd but say wtlk was had plz kid
[6:08:48] Pannekaker: @Axeroska 64
[6:08:57] icipher_tv: not even close LUL
[6:09:07] CrusaderNero: lool
[6:09:16] Ezekyler: die FeelsGoodMan
[6:09:16] Krigsgurun: @sha1yen  ah y thats right 🤙 I've forgotten all that, i was a druid so I should have remembered 😂
[6:09:19] vaxian_0528: do it then! xD
[6:09:23] Vance: KEKW almost died to campfire
[6:09:26] gravelzz: KEKW
[6:09:26] Mitune: darn fire ruined the ambush
[6:09:27] MrGattz: !towRng
[6:09:28] Moobot: you rolled a 40 (1...100)
[6:09:30] Jamalamadingdong: rolls 100
[6:09:35] xXDuffinXx: roll - 100
[6:09:38] TacticalWee: lol
[6:09:50] Ezekyler: you rolled a 101 (1...100) i woon
[6:09:54] Jamalamadingdong: hey I won Kappa
[6:09:55] Ezekyler: won*
[6:09:57] shrektard69: is prot pally any good in tbc?
[6:10:03] SlonkiJippi: @jkitchin75 Im not saying wotlk generally was hard. Im saying there is hard conent out there for people, but the people who say its easy generally are too shit to complete the really hard content. You calling me a kid doesnt really help your argument.
[6:10:14] we_are_whomp: prot pallys are great but the most gear dependent
[6:10:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:10:17] shrektard69: cool
[6:10:28] Coriollis: they are great except for gruul xD
[6:10:28] GeoSourge: slonk is still crying 🤔
[6:10:39] xXDuffinXx: WotLK had the option of being hard with hard mode and epic raids
[6:10:43] ivanmr122: how do you cast the shield in combat, dont u get pushback from mobs hitting you
[6:10:44] Felrane: you can get capped from just 5 man gear but you will have low HP and people will think you cant tank
[6:10:46] Raidr211: Sword n Board
[6:10:52] Raidr211: no more Fury /Prot
[6:10:59] Vance: I used to yell at  my raid leader because he swore up and down prot Paladin was way worse than bear and Warrior, then I convinced him to let me tank our first ZA and my healers were losing their shit how tanky I was lol
[6:11:22] arcticanomaly: I think ultimately people need to get over the idea of Casual vs Hardcore. all it does it damage the game when there is space for both types of content and players in Wow, and it benefits from both.
[6:11:35] Coriollis: yeah the crushing blows realy destroy prot pala
[6:11:43] Sha1yen: Legit can't wait for the grind on my tankadin rooComfy
[6:11:46] Ezekyler: a lot of things to do at max level to unlock to get the chance to get the gear
[6:11:57] Xenrawr: But you can probably just do Karazhan with less than ultimate pre-BIS, and get big upgrades there
[6:12:06] ChristendomBaffler: it'd be nice if people did get over it, but wrath most certainly had an issue with having ridiculously easy content and good hard content but without much else in between

[6:17:56] ivanmr122: is hammer of wrath instant now in tbc
[6:18:18] Sha1yen: ssaallzz because pservers never had access to the true data, and had to base everything off estimates and memory
[6:18:26] ArcaneSyntax: should macro switching to concentration aura and then avengers shield. @towelliee
[6:18:31] SSALZ_: ahh
[6:18:47] Attackenkraken: @shrenko sweet gonna be giving people the shocker then

[6:25:59] Sha1yen: @At1c it's on a 4 step rotation. 32 first ones drain mana, 4th one restore
[6:26:05] Sha1yen: *3 first ones

[6:30:28] robert_sigi: It's called "overreaction"; u see it all the time in other sectors of society aswell. Perhaps not on purpose, but as a side effect.
[6:30:36] xzBorn: Is there a good reason why draenei and blood elves arent boostable? I mean if the boost is there for someone who doesnt like levelling in vanilla zones why cant they go blelf if they want? Doesnt make sense to me.
[6:31:01] metavahn231: fist of fury hits 6 targets properly now and does 70% instead of 50% etc
[6:31:08] Nyvill: nagrand is so slow but netherstorm is ZOOMING
[6:31:20] SensatiousTV: It picked up in Nagrand with the grind quests and Arena of Blood giving a MASSIVE chunk of exp
[6:31:21] Thdlock: @xzBorn, the technically is prob that their starting zones are bc starting zones and tehy just want the boost to get you to tbc content not go past it

[6:31:39] silodin: Do you have to level a blood elf paladin from 1 if you start tbc or is that boostable too?
[6:31:46] Cezzan: @Thdlock makes sense, and i prefer it that way
[6:32:00] Nyvill: ye 180 mobs for 6 quests. its awfully slow KEKW

[6:33:48] paradoxyy: @Towelliee Thoughts on adding in dual spec into tbc?
[6:33:49] MrGattz: i think blizzard just wants people to find bugs in the game without having to worry about addons fucking anything up

[6:33:57] chrslp: ^

[6:46:53] lozz3: That makes sense
[6:46:57] garlicco: fake news KKona
[6:46:59] ArcaneSyntax: the real question is why doing any of the vanilla content would matter for testing tbc beta.
[6:47:02] vaxian_0528: but we want it now BabyRage
[6:47:06] TweakT: I never got classic beta im never getting this 1 either
[6:47:15] Thoreya: people always got something to say LUL
[6:47:16] venom366: i know lore but he said you have to wait scrub Kappa
[6:47:25] hoffy07: Just a bunch of jealous people that want to play a Beta. They will forget about it when it goes live, and then they will complain about everything else.
[6:47:28] Layercake: LUL every alpha/beta cycle is the same...they never learn
[6:47:32] arcticanomaly: is it true that being in a previous beta ups your chances of being in other betas?
[6:47:35] ThePhex: @Towelliee which specs do you think will be most popular in tbc?
[6:47:44] heybake: The Classic* community seems a little gate keeper to me. It turns people off on the game.

[6:47:55] xzBorn: Wait are you denying there is value to invite streamers to beta?
[6:47:57] Sha1yen: 200 hours? So you leveled to 60? rooSmug
[6:48:00] garlicco: people care a bit too much about a beta of a game you're gonna play later anyway
[6:48:13] haduken187: 200 hours like try 80 days
[6:48:15] SlayerLightStorm: People need to shut up. Put up or shut up.
[6:48:37] MolarcnShifty: No just the first part @SlayerLightStorm
[6:48:40] Thoreya: i do think the BC beta wouldve been a lil more hype
[6:48:41] twistedstick1: Doesn't matter Towelliee. Some ppl are always going to say it's unfair.
[6:48:46] 클라우센: 9.1 died for this
[6:48:49] rhsiuol: pretty weird how people think everyone saying things about streamers getting invites is jealous
[6:49:04] nooge_time: as a retail player who has played since vanilla, it's this kind of shit that keeps me far far away from classic.  i will never be cool enough for that crowd and i have no desire to enter in their debate
[6:49:07] rhsiuol: seems like a bs deflection I've never played classic and have no interest
[6:49:09] Quatten: dumping 200 days into classic when you could have used that time to befriend Robert Kotick...
[6:49:15] SlayerLightStorm: @twistedstick1 T%hen they say it because they haters. Fuck them haters.
[6:49:18] MrRezy: I don't know what to play in tbc I'm torn between hunter and paladin
[6:49:26] magganss: Why do people care so much about beta, if you so much need to play a buggy as beta, go play on a private server, i promise you will get the same experience
[6:49:27] belfastcl: @nooge_time there is no need to engage with any of that, you can have fun either way
[6:49:31] Streamcrush: hey, all they have to do is become as streamer. I mean, if it's that easy it should be no problem right? Stream for a bit, get invite, boom, life is great!
[6:49:36] Lyffie80: I got TBC beta....back in 2007!
[6:49:39] Emilos711: waves of disapointment
[6:49:42] Kysnar: Im just sat here waiting for classic legion for the mage tower druid  gummy bear
[6:49:49] fooxytv: it would have been funny if he replied bobby is his inside man lol
[6:49:49] ThePhex: can you ask plumpus for his twitch channel? @Towelliee
[6:49:52] silodin: What do you type to enter the beta key giveaway? KEKW
[6:49:54] MolarcnShifty: I am jealous of Towelliee that he is friends with Plumpus.....
[6:49:56] haduken187: It’s stable until the hordes of people stamped the servers
[6:49:59] BobToThe: Preach is the man
[6:50:00] Sha1yen: elligeble?
[6:50:00] Thoreya: preach is better than 99% of everyone talking shit LUL LUL LUL
[6:50:05] grumpybearsx: I think its more content creators and friends and family
[6:50:06] 無職提督: ppl just dumb
[6:50:12] Wegwezen: Besides Blizzard knows his reach
[6:50:12] TweakT: qualify me daddy
[6:50:17] Necrosack: shitting on streamers getting access to the beta is like being pissed that sports casters get into the arena early
[6:50:21] TweakT: peepo r smart
[6:50:21] rhsiuol: @Towelliee because I disagreed with you now your viewers are pming me hate messages KEKW
[6:50:27] Xenrawr: people see the beta access as a reward, not as just a testing assignment
[6:50:28] Fhirn: pessemists
[6:50:34] graysprings: sad*
[6:50:40] Derpalicious: exhausting tbh
[6:50:41] silodin: How do you kill that which has no life
[6:50:41] Harch: people that are logged off 6 days a week with World buffs crying they didnt get beta KEKW
[6:50:54] luckfore: will wrath be the last classic expac?
[6:50:54] Yazabell: be glad that the streamers wanna do this cos we would have a shit game if they don't
[6:50:55] mukulukku: I don't care as long as those guys in beta give some useful feedback so they just release this asap
[6:50:58] garlicco: beta is literally testing and looking for bugs. why would you want to do that for free LUL
[6:50:59] Simplypewpew: Like a rich preson says, money doesnt make you happy
[6:51:04] GodTheMechanic: They also need people who are actually gonna give feedback, rather than just bitch to themselves/friends/Reddit that a beta is unstable or buggy
[6:51:08] graysprings: @Towelliee Loving the music mix my dude towBolvar
[6:51:27] MolarcnShifty: We all just need a Plumpus in our lives to keep us happy!
[6:51:33] TheCliffyShow: To many companies have used betas as glorified demos or marketing. Now, gamers expect to be able to get in every one easy.
[6:51:33] ThePhex: ask for plumpus twitch stream pls!
[6:51:43] SlayerLightStorm: @Tigonstar They need to leasrn to love more. Otherwise, they have no place in this world.
[6:51:57] valottaja: is that pretty fresh pala ?
[6:52:03] jokercowboysl: i mean all im saying is all the streamers or whoever got invited first cant all be friends or family no way
[6:52:08] Emilos711: and thats wrong, marketing
[6:52:20] Layercake: They have being spoon feed for years by the private server community, that retail players are not real players,they never experienced the true wow etc. They don't know any better poor people.
[6:52:23] grumpybearsx: what steamers got denied
[6:52:25] MrGattz: im so happy that happened
[6:52:28] NiozeY: @endreur, I got beta once in Cata..Its lottery, life isnt always perfect
[6:52:30] Thoreya: i mean
[6:52:36] Thoreya: im sure some of it is marketing lol lets be real
[6:52:36] Streamcrush: that happened? lmao awesome
[6:52:44] Sha1yen: wait really? Hadn't heard that, that's awesome LUL
[6:52:56] sesenji: plz dont

[6:53:15] WinterSoonBe: BOOGIE DOWN!
[6:53:15] TheCliffyShow: Exactly, so a company treating a beta as an actual testing phase of the game surprises people.
[6:53:24] Eternaalll: @Towelliee did u accept the quest first?
[6:53:24] Pannekaker: @endreur Why the fuck does it matter?
[6:53:25] Sepron14: Endreur stfu you troll
[6:53:30] NiozeY: How else should they give players beta? You seem to know if not shut up
[6:53:38] Sepron14: How can you live your life like such a nonce
[6:53:40] Sielu11628: Imagine being upset for not getting into a beta for a 14 year old game!

[6:54:13] MrGattz: @endreur your ranting mate, stop it
[6:54:24] xzBorn: There is no value in giving beta to streamers.
[6:54:24] MrGattz: were gonna move on from the subject
[6:54:26] Taters_: @endreur ur just pushing ur own point without hearing whats being told to u

[7:44:49] Docliin: Oh man. Prot paladin with mana. Got to love it. and miss it
[7:44:56] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee That due is for the quest, where you shrink him and he is not an elite anymore

[7:50:18] GonoFPS: what's the cacth again with rep, you don't get rep past revered with quests or no more rep from dungeon mobs after revered

[7:52:47] Zubberikan: @Towelliee is there any change to wow (retail or classic) that would make you stop playing it?
[7:53:04] The_Swoleton: what server is the classic guild on?
[7:53:10] GonoFPS: !tbc
[7:53:11] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[7:53:17] Rottencoarse: dont forget the flight path
[7:53:19] Eternaalll: @Zubberikan ye it's been a while for me too,but the experience was so traumatic that i still remember it hah
[7:53:19] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee
[7:53:27] Rottencoarse: instead of walking XD
[7:53:48] TheGaoSora: What if Heroic would become Mythic difficulty?

[7:54:09] NiozeY: never been a fp there
[7:54:10] sirledros: I saw you playing FF14 the other day, have you done any of the Savage raids in FF14?
[7:54:12] Eternaalll: ye there's none.
[7:54:12] Gargeth: There is no FP there.

[7:54:53] Zubberikan: @Eternaalll pro tip in case you don't know: Log in early before reset and fly up in the air over the fort. All the eggs are there after reset. Even if you get 2-3 it's still a huge boost to rep.
[7:54:54] swordwindgaming: Oh, I thought you were going to say you're playing because of your friends. LUL
[7:54:59] GonoFPS: raiding is the cake of wow
[7:55:14] Lokajin: can confirm raid logger here
[7:55:31] Fhirn: if mythic raiding stops, and you stop doing retail. Blizz should hire you and you probly make wow amazing again
[7:55:36] Eternaalll: @Zubberikan ye ik :D,still have ptsd after doing that for weeks on end hah
[7:55:41] Dagomarus: My name is Dagomarus and i am raid addict LUL towHAMUP
[7:55:42] TwitchGurls: i worship raiding
[7:55:45] raldrik: do you think they should remove the weekly lockout on mythic raiding or add key levels beyond normal mythic?
[7:55:49] OrdinaryCritter: @OogeyMyNoogey thinking $15 is a lot of money 🤡
[7:55:51] luckfore: mythic is here to stay
[7:56:09] Lokajin: mythic raiding keystones would be insane xD lul
[7:56:22] DegenerateHaven: as long as 9.1 is quality its alright
[7:56:28] ItsAMeNat: that's a whole POE league LUL
[7:56:34] DramaticTv: i feel like you only use covid as an excuse for so long
[7:56:37] BaratusTV: Then again when was the last time we had a 10 boss first raid?
[7:56:38] capnkalland: A lot more people are probably going to stop playing because of it
[7:56:40] luckfore: its such a long wait for a first patch, it better be good
[7:56:40] seanb4games: In corona times? 15 bucks is 3 meals at tacobell thanks
[7:56:53] Zubberikan: I'm a huge fan of the lore and the raid cinematics in Legion were just amazing. I was watching your stream when you finished Nighthold and watch the youtube clip pretty often haha. It was actually a crime how they did N'zoth.
[7:56:54] Eternaalll: thrallmar has an INN
[7:57:12] ItsAMeNat: they will
[7:57:14] RadRage69: anyone knows a good addon to sort out the icons arround the map?
[7:57:16] geokouts: i am sure this year though :P
[7:57:18] mr3machine: If it is to ensure a great patch, Im ok
[7:57:19] elitepower97: Shadowlands was over hyped as fuck if you ask me hope 9.1 is go tho..
[7:57:19] CDubTheRIPper: burkeShrug
[7:57:20] Ryotsun: rightfully so, imo
[7:57:25] GonoFPS: last night I dream I was doing a ZA time run
[7:57:34] luckfore: must feel bad for the devs too
[7:57:49] capnkalland: if it's good I'll stay, but I'm pretty burnt out of retail
[7:57:56] jayplayscorner: then wotlk
[7:57:56] KingSlayerYotam: I like the drought, can finally do other stuff besides wow
[7:57:57] Fhirn: i think half the devs should be payed to play the game and get more in touch with their product and community
[7:58:01] Stonefather: Wrath + incoming PogChamp
[7:58:09] LSDwight: man 9.1 is coming way too slow lol. 9ish months till the next big drop? waaayyyyy too slow
[7:58:09] Virtusinvicta: a mmorpgs is not all about raiding and if you only play a mmorpg for raiding then that is a bad mmorpg
[7:58:10] SamULJackson: must be tough when people prefer your 15 year old game to your current version. jesus
[7:58:18] IVIDH: @RadRage69 Neat Minimap
[7:58:28] Vyntage1: TBC will carry until people find that it's not challenging enough to keep players interest... then back to Retail they'll go
[7:58:29] LSDwight: no wonder people are dropping like flies in SL
