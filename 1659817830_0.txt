[6:18:16] Morpheusx25: no borrowed power
[6:18:17] Yagr6: threads of fate is better yea?
[6:18:20] draskia: im so ready for a new expansion
[6:18:21] s_t_o_r_m__: finally
[6:18:23] unsuspectinghippo: yay!!
[6:18:27] draskia: I did love shadowlands thooo
[6:18:29] DudeJoeyAwesome: i hope they bring back a better version of Torghast. I think that'd be fun.
[6:18:30] unsuspectinghippo: im super excited to play alts again
[6:18:40] Theduskflyer: Yet‚Ä¶..
[6:18:44] Tigerklaue: dragonflying is so much fun, you get from quest to quest in a second
[6:18:46] BRUTALIT0PS: SL was the first expansion since Wrath that I didn't have 5+ max level characters
[6:18:50] snake_like: good. they experimented with Legion and it paid off.
[6:18:51] Bernardo994: I think this will be good and they will build on it
[6:18:59] thundergun__88: borrow power just feels... bleh IMO
[6:19:01] breadwilton: Still full price though baby
[6:19:03] Yagr6: legendary later could be enough borrowed power for me
[6:19:03] superpudd: I think that one borrowed power system would be the answer
[6:19:05] JRobezzz: Outside of tier sets, I really do not want borrowed power. It makes it too hard to properly balance and design classes
[6:19:06] chill_xf: i think it dpends on the content they give us in the place of borrowed power
[6:19:13] udderlyepicgaming: the borrowed power system was the worst idea they ever came out with
[6:19:19] xsp00n: people are going to bitch about DF, just for the sake of bitching
[6:19:20] breadwilton: They are giving us professions instead
[6:19:22] breadwilton: which is lame

[6:19:38] 91Niki: @Towelliee I can only assume they have some sort of stuff backed up and ready to go in case people don't have enough stuff to do
[6:19:54] s_t_o_r_m__: My name is Storm, I'm an altoholic
[6:19:59] thundergun__88: DF seems like a hit other than the Dracthyr/Evoker negative feedback
[6:20:01] abracka_: i don't think borrowed power itself was the issue. the issue was that it was such a punishing system that did not respect your time for wanting to play alts
[6:20:04] Metket: @Towelliee i totally agree but what if players loved grinds but blizzard will see that in the end but they already started working on next exp?
[6:20:09] SirSquaggles: @s_t_o_r_m__ you too huh?
[6:20:13] Tigerklaue: last expansion i had fun with alts was legion
[6:20:14] calm_down_meoww: doesn't the popularity of classic  illustrate that
[6:20:22] Brodih_: alts with the new talent system will be fun indeed
[6:20:23] Lemon_King: Blizzard hasn't done any live action promotion in ages.
[6:20:28] Clayman225: did i miss the mount drop?
[6:20:28] razzmahtaz: yeah, the advertising campaign has been nuts
[6:20:45] PigPenLen: haha thank you diablo immortal
[6:20:47] RageerPLZ: oh man they trying to bring that guy back into what nearly ruined his life that's cold blizzard
[6:21:05] Slapboxh: lol
[6:21:15] im_n0t_jezus: yeah the spending that cash
[6:21:19] kurlook: Remember the M T commercials
[6:21:22] aesirsghost: Didn't BFA have a decent ad campaign?
[6:21:31] Aidler: "was required to do" was mainly just in the head of people. Not everything that can be done has to be done
[6:21:32] Zivs: they made 3 pretty funny bfa ads
[6:21:47] BobLongMVP: Sup yall
[6:21:48] Tigerklaue: bfa had the big cinematics
[6:21:54] Homgom: what is the differens betwen alliance and horde ? i mean is one better than the other in ques or doesent it matter what i go ?
[6:21:59] abracka_: it's been a hot minute since they had actual actors in a xpac ad campaign tho right?
[6:22:00] xsp00n: BFAs was memorable because of the horde vs ally ads
[6:22:22] Customtrick: Im a casual performer :P
[6:22:27] Yagr6: good point towelliee
[6:22:27] iamspacemanspiff: @Homgom with crossfaction stuff it doesn't matter
[6:22:36] falldrgn: I see they never fixed the wowhead memory leak.. had it open game started chunking
[6:22:40] thundergun__88: Shadowlands felt hard to get back into after clearing Castle Nath
[6:22:44] snake_like: you HAD to do visions to be fairly competitive. unless you were a BM hunter which only needed like 3 corruption pieces to pop off
[6:22:46] its_vixa: lmao i left during bfa and came back 3 weeks ago

[6:22:54] Homgom: ok thanks :)
[6:23:15] alucard3zz: @Towelliee why are you leveling another dk?
[6:23:22] cheetalol: what was the expansion where they had ozzy ozbourne and mr t in their commercials
[6:23:35] xsp00n: people level in wow using dungeon finder then bitch theres nothing to do, but then quit and go to a 200hr MSQ in FF14
[6:23:35] Morpheusx25: @cheetalol wrath
[6:23:36] JohnsOrb: I still want a single rep for account, grinding multiple toons on a single rep gets old

[6:23:50] Revoca: @Homgom Alliance is better for PvE
[6:23:52] Tigerklaue: all i hope is that the raid isnt overtuned
[6:24:02] Slapboxh: I had fun with corruptions in bfa
[6:24:06] PigPenLen: I'm a lazy grinder.. stresses out about not being max but too lazy to stop watching streamers do it LUL
[6:24:17] Sollice: @Towelliee Checkout that Discord message I just send
[6:24:26] Tigerklaue: twilightbeam for 10mil

[6:24:28] Big_Kan: @JohnsOrb I thought they announced that was coming in this Xpac
[6:24:31] chill_xf: best part of bfa

[6:24:42] Theliahh: corruptions were awful once we had the vendor
[6:24:44] SirSquaggles: corruption was fun but i didn't like how much rng was tied to my rotation
[6:24:45] im_n0t_jezus: was BIS
[6:24:45] fcwar_: Twilight Dev tanks were amazing
[6:24:46] udderlyepicgaming: that was the best no matter what you played
[6:24:46] ursinealli: TD was fun til it pulled shit through walls.....
[6:24:48] Theliahh: awesome*
[6:24:52] Synk_live: @JohnsOrb nothing account wide, just catch up mechanics for each rep
[6:24:53] tumble_vision: twilight dev 3 all tank runs
[6:24:53] udderlyepicgaming: bring it back as a Talent
[6:24:55] Fortvila: it was fun after they fixed the RNG aspect of it
[6:24:55] 3663Sharad: Plain affix for M+ KEKW
[6:24:55] snake_like: corruption was fun if you were A. lucky, B. had a class that was great with corruption
[6:24:55] xpsyked: I tried doing 1 per class, but after doing mostly Warrior/Warlock, I feel like deleting everyone and have all Warrior/Locks lmao @Towelliee
[6:24:58] xsp00n: you pull a pact, dont get a proc, and the mage rips agro cause agro was purely based of TD
[6:24:58] GodKingMuninn: I will, but I played ret pally and got a proc once an hour.
[6:25:02] JackedDown: Way too powerful to bring back but it was awesome KEKW
[6:25:03] DaVeGaLiSoT: 8.3 most fun I've had in wow EVER
[6:25:14] ShinoaKurisu: an heirloom trinket with TD would be lit
[6:25:19] jaedfe: PvP Brawl with old corruption would be fun
[6:25:23] Snabido: It's like calling down the thunder, but void
[6:25:26] tumble_vision: all tank nylotha
[6:25:27] RageerPLZ: corruption was hugely fun, really though I just enjoyed being fast with the corruption haste stacking, being fast is fun
[6:25:28] fcwar_: Pulling Tol Dagor trash through walls with TD LUL
[6:25:30] Thoreya: 8.2 was sick
[6:25:33] MoodyVanessa: the only way i liked any corruption was when i played a tank
[6:25:33] DaVeGaLiSoT: Agreed
[6:25:33] idenkaz_: 8.2 was a content monster lol
[6:25:46] Theduskflyer: People who complain about corrupted gear, never got what they wanted/meta. If you had the good stuff, you loved it. If you had like leach. You hated it.
[6:25:55] Brodih_: the story was meh if i remember
[6:26:11] xsp00n: TD was only fun if it proced on pull, if it proced 5seconds after your group just died
[6:26:18] Artenuous: BFA not nearly as bad as people made it out to be. I think us being spoiled in Legion made us not appreciate it as much
[6:26:23] snake_like: balance corruptions and bring the corruption vendor out day 1 and 8.3 would have been the best patch to date
[6:26:25] Caveman_3: I just missed the beginning of this. What was your favorite expansion?
[6:26:29] Pimento: what is your favorite expamsion?
[6:26:30] Yagr6: free gold
[6:26:31] fcwar_: Just wait for BFA Classic Towelliee
