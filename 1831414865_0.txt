[5:00:55] Hymmer: Bears deserve better
[5:01:03] Crisis88: If he doesnt eat enough frogs or a player he enrages
[5:01:23] infektyd: you can also bait all of the swoglets into his suck in to make sure he doesnt enrage, also negates the swoglets
[5:02:26] infektyd: DH right now are out of control.. wym haha
[5:02:41] infektyd: less utility.. but just damage and self sustain..
[5:03:01] valianya: The bear tank philosophy was originally most armor and health of tanks so they can soak up any magic damage no issues.  But they don't have enough health and armor comparatively anymore to do that without magic mitigation
[5:04:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear mastery adds to health and increases healing taken, which is not the worst... with a bunch of it, it really amps up heals
[5:05:59] valianya: Good ones have faint beam of light on them
