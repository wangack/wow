[0:40:23] Trexbo_: YEP You can make your own group, it's just very frustrating if it's with random people
[0:40:25] brakealot: feral is great support class atm, you do meh dps but bring wf and 3%crit
[0:40:30] DaTh_Champ: If you are in a guild, it just makes the raid so much better and you can get away with like 2 warriors or 2 rogues easily
[0:40:31] HelluvaWrecks: yeah, people who complain about not getting into pugs are usually scared to make their own
[0:40:32] 3Brick_: @Guzu i think it is harded to join a group than create a group
[0:40:34] Joxtirol: i looked for 5h for a raid as a rogue and then make my own
[0:40:36] BALtaram: retail is better with this, since every class has many options, puggers are not picky
[0:40:40] bl1nk_1298: i pugged exclusively in phase 1 and had no issues getting groups
[0:40:54] MeowgicTheCathering: idk which is worse tho, pugs or guzler demon raids guzuDespair

[0:48:18] TheWhiteRabbitxX: lameemotetyping
[0:48:20] MrAdams26: There's a story in WoW?
[0:48:22] Smooo07: @Sharpnel_89 really?
[0:48:23] fetza108: FirstTimeChatter
[0:48:41] Genghish: There is in retail
[0:48:42] Vaniela_Paramedic: story ended at Wotlk?
[0:48:42] hushbang: Retail is like watching Guzu denny his 7 lambo's and LA mansion
[0:48:47] etzix92: there's a TON of lore in warcraft but WoW is all about the endgame
[0:48:47] Anmaela: i mean it was really bad to level to 120 thourgh every expac
[0:48:49] mlady_telegramz97: Bedge
[0:48:49] Locktapuss: emote fail to refute truth
[0:48:52] Trexbo_: @Typonaa widepeepoHappy It has!
[0:48:54] JariMurhapuro: wow use to have a streamlined but it did rwquire 120 lvls to level to end game
[0:48:58] MeowgicTheCathering: next expac they will YEP
[0:48:59] Parshce: That raid ready boost is the most soul crushing thing
[0:49:09] TheWhiteRabbitxX: retail is cool for long achievements and quests for titles and stuff. a lot more solo content where you can just ignore all the toxic people
[0:49:10] StreamElements: Go check out my Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/guzutv
[0:49:35] neructo: not enough content for all the leveling process and missing knowledge regarding the lore
[0:49:37] MeowgicTheCathering: Comfi
[0:49:41] mlady_telegramz97: PepeLa
[0:49:44] t4pekid: M+ is the best
[0:49:47] TheWhiteRabbitxX: yeah it’s fun sometimes.
[0:49:48] 21Khal: ^
[0:49:52] TheWhiteRabbitxX: the xmog and stuff
[0:49:53] Anmaela: for me it was great to not do draenor for the 100th time though XD
[0:49:56] Parshce: Or you sit and wait for time lost proto drake
[0:49:56] Smooo07: OM
[0:49:57] fetza108: @TheWhiteRabbitxX yes same here. i play like this retail and classic for interacting with other players.
[0:49:58] SinicalDev: i do raiding and m+ on retail and chill leveling on sod/classic
[0:50:01] Typonaa: i hate that in retail they force you to switch to the newest expansion after hitting level 60 Madge let me level in older content
[0:50:02] Serese420: i did solo shuffle pvp for p1 and 2 of dragon flight but gets boring fast
[0:50:03] mlady_telegramz97: GROUP LOOT
[0:50:04] mlady_telegramz97: pepeW
[0:50:05] edd_3000: There should still be options to explore the story though for people who are interested in it, rather than ignoring it or letting it rust. I don't think newcomers who check WoW out are interested in rushing to end game, because they have no idea what's going on anyway. There is no path or vision for them yet. The grim reality is, WoW is just not friendly to newcomers, and that's why it's playerbase is stagnating. The older players are fed up, and the new players are lost.
[0:50:09] Guzumerchmanager: i love the classic vanilla were u could just get online farm herbs and stuff and sell it on AH or do 1450 DM jump runs if u were autistic enough @Guzu LUL
[0:50:10] Grantelbartt: looks like an average Guzu Stream YEP
[0:50:10] ChiefMango: mythic+ / raid is so much more enjoyable in retail. but being in the classic world and pvp out in the world and just overall class feel is so good in classic

[0:51:06] MrAdams26: Paid chatter
[0:51:08] Vaniela_Paramedic: whilst retail there is so much bloat, and even trying to watch it, theres way too much going on
[0:51:15] edd_3000: I've made a video on it Guzu, but it feels really cringe to plug it and ask you to react to it lol, but it got 62k views for my first ever video, it's a long one though. I put a new video out today
[0:51:17] Parshce: “Ah, an achievement section! Let’s see, there’s… four thousand achievements. wtf”
[0:51:18] regularpers: i had that fdeeling playing retail, cause of the different options to progress but not that much in classic

[0:51:24] p5ycc: Well i think classic and sod is not that bad on new players
[0:51:35] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I agree and I like the level plateus for that reason in sod.
[0:51:38] hushbang: its literally designed for new WOW players to classic ..... "seaason of Discovery"
[0:51:48] SinicalDev: WoW has so little bloat in geenral though, try playing an eastern MMO for the first time
[0:51:48] Trexbo_: YEP
[0:51:52] TheWhiteRabbitxX: when people get 60 in a week it makes a lot of people think they’re already behind and they just stop

[0:52:27] Vaniela_Paramedic: but tis the same with wow, do you rememebr your first time on wow?

[0:52:50] TheWhiteRabbitxX: yeah once you learn it’s awesome
[0:52:56] Vaniela_Paramedic: I remember playing wow at 14, and all i did was run around whacking boars
[0:52:57] fetza108: what i dont like really in retail the visual effects and too fast fight system with too many abilities.
[0:52:58] Goretech_: If they took the time to break down every expansion to a few quest chains we could easily catch people up on the lore
[0:53:00] Parshce: I sure do love Redridge! Wait, what’s this fiery zone over here? Clueless

[0:56:05] Parshce: Yeah, classic fights do leave a lot to be desired compared to retail
[0:56:13] Parshce: at least vanilla ones
[0:56:16] positive_ions: it doesn't have to be all one or the other? go figure
[0:56:20] mlady_telegramz97: people liking both versions of MY game? thats not true RAGEY
[0:56:26] Tropicocity: @Guzu Also classic and SoD have the improved shadows (and raytracing LOL) as well as we all have PCs that run it well compared to 2005

[0:56:41] mlady_telegramz97: i hated that boss so much man

[0:57:51] Amberillion: I think FF14 managed to find a good way for raids in that regard: You either choose to play with learning players or you go for the fast kill. Might be something WoW implements as well one day?

[0:58:07] mlady_telegramz97: we need to do that as an emotr
[0:58:08] TheWhiteRabbitxX: retail is fun if you see it as a collection game. progression is the same every patch and previous prog is meaningless. it’s a hamster wheel

[0:58:15] Smooo07: its like that with games in general, if you take it to serious it takes the fun away from it

[1:01:17] mlady_telegramz97: Classic
[1:01:17] drconvicto: @BALtaram yeah id say its alot shorter than for example oblivion or morrowind. Thing is, fallout has choices in which they drag you in different directions making it possibly very much longer than it has to be.
[1:01:17] t4pekid: Nerf Warriors
[1:01:18] Trexbo_: @Typonaa It was definitely too much om
[1:01:21] MrAdams26: nahhh

[1:01:27] potnis__: yes they are
[1:01:28] Yvernaa: They nerfed Balance Druid quantHmph They're doing a bad job
[1:01:32] Locktapuss: I'm shocked they havent separated PvP and PvE skills like they did in retail, is that a version issue?
[1:01:32] TwiceOneTime: class balance sucks... thats part of the problem with retail...
[1:01:32] 3Brick_: riott Give Mages Deep Freeze Frost Mage is underpowered
[1:01:33] bleepfreak: buff shamans
[1:01:34] Joxtirol: they are
[1:01:35] Lebbe89: why is hunter op ?
[1:01:39] mlady_telegramz97: i saw a video of a hunter soloing SM cath in the morning
[1:01:41] mlady_telegramz97: OM
[1:01:41] drconvicto: @Lebbe89 ¨they are not
[1:01:41] joms_guitar: Ele shamans need a nerf
[1:01:43] Dracconfoo: i get 2 shot as a warrior agains melee hunter if they crit
[1:01:45] lana88: getting one shot by melee hunters as a caster isn't OP ?
[1:01:46] dicerttv: rogues need aoe
[1:01:47] BALtaram: @drconvicto, bro oblivion has very short main quest om morrowind maybe but fallout 1 and 2 are kind long for first time playthrough
[1:01:48] bl1nk_1298: they arent op lol, mages and warlocks are already catching them in dps
[1:01:52] its_slesh: but its ok mages pulling whole instance solo right ?
[1:01:52] MrAdams26: just let us have fun this phase
[1:01:53] mlady_telegramz97: (in a single pull btw)
[1:01:56] 3Brick_: @Guzu Arcane healer mage does more damage than Frost mage Sadge
[1:01:57] mrshardzy: wtf, dude they are insane in both pvp and pve, they do the same nuke as a druid, just less range
[1:01:59] barns20: locks are going to be crazy strong in a few weeks just wait
[1:02:13] TwiceOneTime: they dont need to buff or nerf classes... thats the problem with retail everything is over balanced
[1:02:13] lil_mr_toby: Didn't priest get a buff and a nerf?
[1:02:20] bleepfreak: 2h enh shaman, pretty "forced" to play dual wield now to be viable
[1:02:23] Locktapuss: @barns20 what changes? still picking a class

[1:02:49] barns20: locks and mages too when the get more gear they will pump hard
[1:02:54] thedirtbagel: Talk to people lol
[1:02:57] BALtaram: retail is actually the most balanced it has ever been, difference between top and bottom is like 5%
[1:02:58] Guzumerchmanager: pve they prob have same issues as warriors in raids due to the high armor @Guzu but in pvp they seem pretty damn stupid also with the mana they can just burst right away, where warriors would need rage to ramp up
[1:03:00] drconvicto: @BALtaram fallout 2, go from arroyo to place 2, sovle problem, go to city, learn about place 3, go to place 3 solve problem then grind level, go to place 4 solve problem literally place 5 is the end.
[1:03:02] specialkidmiles: stip naked and dance in a capital city
