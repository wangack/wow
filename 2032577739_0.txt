[0:28:40] YoMamaSoFine69: does dark iron or normal dwarf racial put trinket on cd as healer?
[0:30:07] elricx: @hexunext + the worst thing about playing healer in ss is that, you are getting +0 or +X rating all the time
[0:30:42] hexunext: Yea that too, but I mostly lose lobbies when no one stops CC chains. Which is annoying
[0:31:09] wardelswijk: what u think about evoker buffs?
[0:32:58] calculus111: What healer do you enjoy the most atm?
[0:33:13] wardelswijk: thats true ^^
[0:34:17] elricx: PVE was shit fiesta in m+ last season, because only aug + sp + fire mage was viable legit god comp and if you wanted to push high keys, you needed to play god comp and they nerfed sp because of that and SP is dogshit rn in pvp
