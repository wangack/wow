[1:14:09] MrGharr: it says "AT LEAST"
[1:14:19] thisgamesucks99: Agreed boosts weren‚Äôt available then and a cap of 80 isn‚Äôt too tough
[1:14:24] love_eggplant: it means they still want money after 90 days
[1:14:30] love_eggplant: and will allow paid services
[1:14:33] brokenjester: this is assuming the server is populated...i think thats in there in case the servers are dead
[1:14:35] hypno7iq: all the servers will end up dead in 3-6 months...like there will end up only being 1 megaserver for each faction lol
[1:14:38] Snabido: Minimum I guess
[1:14:42] Finiin: sounds like maybe they might extend it
[1:14:44] MrGharr: i think it can be 90 days or 180 days, depending on community feedback
[1:15:20] thisgamesucks99: A majority of WoW players mention their favorite expat being wrath so I dunno
[1:15:23] Moroth95: alot of the fresh server players are gonna be pserver ppl and alot of new players starting for wrath. there will be a big dropoff after the first phase especially if they drag out p1 like they did with tbc
[1:15:26] CrusaderNero: Think WotLK will hold people longer? Really doubt it.
[1:15:31] Tages: so the fresh server dies after 90 days
[1:15:50] MrGharr: problem with character transfer, is that you bring in other stuff, not just your level.
[1:16:53] thisgamesucks99: I‚Äôd probably dungeon crawl till 55 and roll a DK :)
[1:16:58] MrGharr: they could just limit the gold/inventory to really minimal.
[1:17:09] Joneeeez: a lot of alpha rumors going on cool I really hope we will see any news for Dragonflight alpha soon too bois :D
[1:17:20] Clockwerk_Industries: I see "at least" as a trial period
[1:17:30] Finiin: if the sever is going good, they prob won't allow transfers.  if it's dying then they will is how i see it
[1:17:37] ShadowDMG6969: I feel like Classic should just be Classic all the way
[1:17:47] angryhonkinggoose: Oh this is Wrath of the Lich King Classic? That's neat
[1:18:06] thisgamesucks99: True agreed classic needs to be classic
[1:18:06] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee They are consolidating like 22 low pop servers in August
[1:18:14] MrGharr: @ShadowDMG6969 what do you mean by "Classic"?
[1:18:32] DeanoTV: There will still be classic only realms
[1:18:45] thisgamesucks99: They mean the way it was originally

[1:19:09] CrusaderNero: Classic era servers gone?
[1:19:14] MrGharr: people are confusing classic with vanilla
[1:19:18] thisgamesucks99: Bank alts named ‚ÄúTrustfund‚Äù LUL
[1:19:26] Keyastaron_: THATS ME
[1:19:28] Keyastaron_: :P
[1:19:32] Sheppp: i think the classic era server stay but you cant clone anymore or somethin
[1:19:32] ShadowDMG6969: I don't remember ever being able to boost or transfer characters with Original WOTLK but then again I was a kid by all means so Money spending wasn't my thing
[1:19:59] NieIas: any gnomes
[1:20:07] Keyastaron_: whats yr toons name? doomer with alt charaters?
[1:20:12] thisgamesucks99: They introduced boosts in MoP
[1:20:27] wigglenobber: they had 3x xp starting then i think
[1:20:35] wigglenobber: the recruit a friend
[1:20:37] angryhonkinggoose: Its a fight between Nostalgia and the human need for novelty and new content.
[1:20:46] Snabido: Boosts became a thing at end of MoP. Remember the gnome video? üòè
[1:20:49] Finiin: for some reason i think transfer was in BC
[1:21:01] MrGharr: I think they should create LFD enabled realms.
[1:21:50] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:22:02] thisgamesucks99: The thing is why not play retail, so just leave classic as it was. People want the experience. More players had fun with the original mechanics like bombs
[1:22:14] crich85: You gonna level on a fresh launch server in wrath?
[1:22:15] Finiin: the cross faction was one of the best things they did in awhile
[1:22:24] NieIas: horde is dying
[1:23:01] Snabido: Offline raiding Pog
[1:23:13] hypno7iq: the leveling aspect of the fresh will be great to watch/play

[1:23:40] Tehsunman: need cross realm guilds
[1:24:09] hypno7iq: no race change in classic hurts...I had my classic races all setup to be able to race change in wrath
[1:24:20] thisgamesucks99: I mean if they change classic to the point it becomes retail
[1:24:28] duffluv22: GM from Colorado. GO STEELERS!!! That is all.
[1:24:38] Moroth95: they said they might implement retail group finder, so lets see
[1:24:42] Moroth95: might not be that bad
[1:24:51] kekdubbb: i would play wrath, but no looking for dungeon ruins it for me
[1:25:07] kekdubbb: dltn have time to sit in chat looking for group, then flying to dungeon
[1:25:15] MrGharr: With fresh realms they could create LFD/non LFD servers
[1:25:29] hypno7iq: the social aspect of wow is gone...90% of groups are gdkp or reserved runs.
[1:25:30] thisgamesucks99: Then it just becomes the UNsocial retail
[1:25:50] Moroth95: @zookabang pepega take
[1:25:52] hypno7iq: dungeon finder has to be in 1-79 to be helpful for levelers
[1:25:55] thisgamesucks99: Garrison in WoD was the worst idea ever for the social
[1:25:58] hypno7iq: i think it was an awful idea
[1:26:06] PhillyDilly18: I'm curious how many people they used as data to say that the community didn't want LFG. 1,000 people? 5? 10k?
[1:26:09] Moroth95: all wrath pservers have lfd and it works fine
[1:26:15] NieIas: or atleast enable LFG for leveling
[1:26:17] Moroth95: why wouldnt it work in classic LUL
[1:26:40] Zippaya: Zippaya subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[1:26:46] not_pr0: and all the people who are nostalgic for wrath
[1:26:48] thisgamesucks99: If you force players to communicate they are more likely to form relationships
[1:27:08] rohdey: got our selves an xmas group here towHAMUP
[1:27:13] not_pr0: that dont play wow
[1:27:15] Rexialiton: Morning
[1:27:22] Moroth95: they did the same mistake with season of mastery, and that died after 2months so...
[1:27:24] PhillyDilly18: Do you think they would keep the classic servers going for as long as retail exists?
[1:27:26] thisgamesucks99: It‚Äôs the crybaby ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna walk‚Äù mentality changes that ruined the social aspect
[1:27:35] MrGharr: as a casual wrath player, LDF was the best thing ever.
[1:27:53] mavericks312: there listening to the extreme candies with the no LFD

[1:28:04] RolexKT: Yea it's definitely a feature from 20 years ago that has been pushed away for a reason
[1:28:07] Tyrrindorr: i would rather have comunity over quality of life 100% of the time
[1:28:23] Nostoroth: dungeon spaming was best part of wrath
[1:28:30] emznev: neeed LFD do not want to look at spam all day trying to find a group
[1:28:35] thisgamesucks99: As a solo player in WoW I just disagree
[1:28:35] ShadowDMG6969: Quality of life changes are nice but sometimes it's better to use a system that was not broken
[1:28:39] Tyrrindorr: reason i dont play retail, ur a IO number instead of an individual
[1:28:47] Moroth95: @Tyrrindorr you dont loose community with lfg lol why is this even an argument
[1:28:57] mavericks312: @ShadowDMG6969 LFD was not broken
[1:29:00] NieIas: would be cool if they made some realms that has all those QoL things disabled, rest of realms have lfg etc
[1:29:29] MrGharr: TBC classic has no LFD but no community either

[1:29:41] mavericks312: ppl forget wrath was the casualization of WoW
[1:29:42] thisgamesucks99: Yeah but those players don‚Äôt create an enviro,ent conducive to what made an MMO an MMO. People want to see players in the wild
[1:29:58] ShadowDMG6969: @mavericks312 not saying it was, Just saying if the old system from OG WOTLK works just use it
[1:30:05] thisgamesucks99: That‚Äôs why 90% of the game is unused and empty
[1:30:43] Tyrrindorr: they re qwas too much servers, thats why they died out
[1:31:56] thisgamesucks99: If I logon I wanna see players no matter where I am. You don‚Äôt see that anymore. Desolate wastelands lol
[1:32:08] dreamwalker213: After 90 days fresh servers will become fucked just like the rest
[1:32:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: all the fresh server andys gonna transfer their mains the day it opens and ruin the economy again

[1:32:50] Finiin: @zookabang you have to remember that game is a lot bigger now, it has tons of zones
[1:32:58] bakurathewolf: is na down?
[1:32:59] Torwolf: I was ripping aggro hard with Havoc DH earlier
[1:33:24] thisgamesucks99: But that‚Äôs what I mean retail only made it worse. What‚Äôs the point of having such a large game for it to be empty
[1:33:48] dreamwalker213: @zookabang it‚Äôs a 15+ year old game what do you expect
[1:34:10] MrGharr: Even on a full BC server you can't see anyone leveling, because everyone is boosting
[1:34:10] dreamwalker213: Of course majority of it isn‚Äôt gonna be used anymore
[1:34:14] mavericks312: @zookabang thats why they gave us achievements to keep us going all over
[1:34:17] N3llee: yea not a fan of recycled dungeons.
[1:34:25] Finiin: i think bringing back the old one's are great
[1:34:26] DeanoTV: they cant win
[1:34:26] Tehsunman: LOL\
[1:34:30] tonygzS: OMEGALUL
[1:34:36] N3llee: wod sucked why would anyone want to do those dungeons again
[1:34:38] Niksen_99: And they are the same people that cry about leveling being too slow
[1:34:41] rohdey: Wrath of Hogger
[1:34:43] mavericks312: WoW players dont know wtf they want
[1:34:53] PhillyDilly18: Dang I know you're kidding, but a Hogger backstory
[1:34:53] thisgamesucks99: So how would you fix the lack of interaction and population in so much of the game
[1:34:54] RolexKT: ^
[1:35:02] Finiin: i also like that they'll be rotating the dungeons each season
[1:35:03] Tehsunman: yo +15 SM i'd love it
[1:35:11] Taz_85: Maybe not for WoW, but a ''Living World'' system definitely works for some MMOs
[1:35:15] Torwolf: @zookabang You don't. Times have changed.
[1:35:20] Kriven: depends on what you are doing in old zones. I still see people farming the mount in spires WOD and various mounts in MOP
[1:35:22] Taz_85: If they do that in the Riot MMO, that'd solve one problem right off the bat
[1:35:23] ShadowDMG6969: honestly sounds like you're describing the part of the community who need to just learn
[1:35:28] thisgamesucks99: I believe that‚Äôs the problem. Wow doesn‚Äôt feel like an MMO anymore
[1:35:29] Sheppp: Id lve to go back and kill more scorpids in shimmering flats
[1:35:32] Sheppp: Kappa
[1:35:33] MrGharr: @zookabang It's not 2005 anymore.
[1:35:42] Tehdoze42069: they said they gonna allow xfers from pve to pvp in classic thats never happened before
[1:35:47] Eithos87: I want lvl'n taking a couple hours not a couple days
[1:36:17] DeanoTV: @Eithos87 same here
[1:36:27] N3llee: there maybe 100+ servers but the population of 80% of the classic exist on about 5 servers.
[1:36:27] thisgamesucks99: As someone who pvp and completed most heroic raids. I‚Äôm a solo player from lack of interaction.
[1:36:51] alibynx: diablo daily later?
[1:36:58] dreamwalker213: @eithos87 that‚Äôs you tho, a lot of people enjoy leveling and don‚Äôt like end game. Which is why you can never please everybody

[1:37:11] mavericks312: but your still getting heroic raids so there is still interaction apparently
[1:37:12] thisgamesucks99: Why do you think they introduced that feature?
[1:37:24] MrGharr: people don't interact anymore in games, they use other online services.
[1:37:32] ShadowDMG6969: You're fighting a Dragon with a Pirates hat & I'm dying with laughter
[1:37:35] thisgamesucks99: From pugging, not from community
[1:37:37] PToastman: I have not been in a guild for 5 years. I‚Äôm solo most of the time but I still see and talk with plenty of people
[1:37:38] mavericks312: classic wow and TBC would not do well these days
[1:37:47] tonygzS: discord didnt exist 10 years ago guys....
[1:37:52] N3llee: think thats a valid point
[1:37:54] N3llee: look at eso
[1:38:01] N3llee: community is insanely tightnet
[1:38:07] thisgamesucks99: You‚Äôre probably right
[1:38:13] NieIas: roll a rp realm if you want that lol
[1:38:16] RolexKT: Everquest is another tight knit one
[1:38:46] Sheppp: on classic and SoM i joined a guild right away and chat was always poppin off.  Always people to play with etc
[1:39:11] thisgamesucks99: I mean the point of playing an MMO is the players.
[1:39:27] Mayhem_George: ESO has lfg tool both for dungeons and battlegrounds. Its the people not the GAME!
[1:39:57] thisgamesucks99: I did play on some of the highest pops. I was on storm rage for quite some time
[1:40:16] Eithos87: I dont like leveling but I enjoy gold making and that requires a full 50 toons of max lvls if not multiple accounts of 50 toons to cover every aspect of gold making.
[1:40:45] N3llee: very dedicated and loyal communites as well
[1:40:56] Torwolf: Nah its easy, go into pvp lobbies. =P
[1:41:00] Finiin: I go back to GW2 every once in awhile and every time people have been so helpful
[1:41:05] Venasmat: There are some toxic players in very high end GW2 content but hey, it's like everywhere
[1:41:18] ShadowDMG6969: ESO is good on PC all the way its with Console that problems arise
[1:41:29] Zippaya: all wow players who not think they are world first raider or mdi champion are nice :)
[1:41:30] dreamwalker213: @zookabang maybe that‚Äôs the point for you, I enjoy wow just as much as anyone else and I mostly play the game solo/pugging. I don‚Äôt need a tight knit, small town like community to enjoy the game
[1:41:33] thisgamesucks99: The WoW community was pretty toxic throughout time. Maybe your right it‚Äôs me and the game I‚Äôm playing. Not the game itself
[1:41:35] Kriven: I think people make the wrong assumption that just by seeing players in the game world magically everyone is gonna be nice and ask to be your friend and group up. Seeing players in the game world does not force interaction
[1:41:59] Djfarmville: yeah its gotten quite boring
[1:42:00] tonyr23: didn't know kyrian dk tanking was a thing
[1:42:16] Snabido: Blood Boil joining Death's Caress in being not used a lot üëÄ
[1:42:19] LoseAlotLuke: resto shaman is kinda like that, they have loads of buttons but like 3 of them you press 95% of the time
[1:42:40] Gingerprimer: Yeah Dorki has talked about since he does not want to waste resorces on blood boil instead of using HS
[1:42:54] Sheppp: @LoseAlotLuke heh.  chain heal and cure posion
[1:43:17] Kriven: ture lol
[1:43:19] Kriven: true
[1:43:50] Finiin: you just have to find the right guild or community
[1:43:54] KronasKG: Do you always hold blood strike for low health or CD it?

[1:44:57] Gingerprimer: Yeah I found BFA mega boring but then I joined a good guild in SL. And it has been so fun even if hindsight BFA was way better than SL
[1:45:05] GhostTurtle330: its a shame nobody is playing New World :(
[1:45:24] Eithos87: I know someone that right now has 69 lvl 60s and his goal is to have 250 60s by dragonflight
[1:45:28] thisgamesucks99: I enjoyed new world but it collapsed
[1:45:29] NA_Mus: Grats on achieve Kappa
[1:45:31] Mecabeast: 9.2.5 thing?
[1:45:33] TheCheeseWheel87: i get it alot too
[1:45:39] warrenny: Its just added gambiy and streets achieves
[1:45:51] LoseAlotLuke: last patch BFA was fun with corruption imo
[1:45:51] xReadyAimMissx: @GhostTurtle330 people are definitely still playing new world. I actually just got a friend into it a couple weeks ago.
[1:45:52] Gingerprimer: There are new Achements for upper and lower since Tazavesh  b4 there was only the regular taza one

[1:47:01] thisgamesucks99: I played new world recently, not much but I wanted to check on it
[1:47:07] GhostTurtle330: @Atrionix Pluto server just lost alot of population so its hard to run WT at endgame
[1:47:13] Gingerprimer: They announced they were merging servers august 9th so maybe prepatch is soon after that for wrath
[1:47:17] Finiin: think we'll get anymore of the new talent trees this week?
[1:48:04] Atrionix: @GhostTurtle330 Yeah Ohonoo isnt doing good either
[1:48:36] LoseAlotLuke: a who what now?
[1:48:42] dimofodi: dimofodi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! 
[1:48:55] Mecabeast: i predict priest and demon hunter trees next
[1:49:01] mavericks312: hows new world doing these days
[1:49:18] Kriven: @Mecabeast we need mage tree
[1:49:28] Atrionix: they said a server merge isn't in the near future
[1:49:38] Finiin: to bad New World didn't have a mega sever
[1:49:48] Frank4LuLz: more content is needed
[1:49:52] Ertra: ill go back to New World when the expedetion keys go away
[1:50:19] Malarick: Ive been on Mamarama the last couple of nights and had no issues in OPR or Invasions.  Ive been waiisted for a few invasions.  population seems healthy
[1:50:20] Atrionix: @Ertra next month
[1:50:21] Finiin: @Ertra i think they did just go away
[1:50:24] Naturalbeef: Critical design flaw
[1:50:29] nilachip: 2k is indeed too low
[1:50:51] vulkankragon: immortal over?
[1:50:58] Sheppp: i like NW but I can't stand the expertise grind
[1:51:26] xReadyAimMissx: This is what my friend said the other day that's coming, "Next month: - No more expedition keys!!! - Expedition Group Finder - New Expedition, Barnacles & Black Powder - Crafting improvements - Big Summer Event! - Tons of QOL, perk/combat tuning - Much more"
[1:51:30] RuFFyLyx: same
[1:51:30] mavericks312: NW's whole continent might be as big as just tanaris
[1:51:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: should have never gonna with the pvp capture shit, without that they could go with a megaserver like eso and just phase people out
[1:51:39] RuFFyLyx: expertise grind is super tarded
[1:52:09] Deadelus0: I don't mind the expertise grind but there's simply not enough content. You're running the SAME thing over and over again..

[1:52:25] N3llee: new world had its chance and lost ark is about to fall just like new world and Amazon just just clueless or powerless or both
[1:52:44] xReadyAimMissx: @N3llee hos is lost ark failing? it's been out for 3 years. LUL
[1:52:47] xReadyAimMissx: *how
[1:52:57] bukka_hot: depths also now has mutations
[1:53:00] ShadowDMG6969: Champion Point System in ESO is a fun time till you have to constantly shange gear, Sets & Skill usage lol
[1:53:03] bukka_hot: and in july 2 new expeditions
[1:53:03] N3llee: @xReadyAimMissx in the west.. no gives a shit about KR
[1:53:18] mavericks312: @N3llee LA is fine with there asia players but yea NA might start to back off
[1:53:32] Finiin: i'm glad amazon canned the LOTR mmo
[1:53:32] N3llee: NA is already falling
[1:53:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: bots are getting out of control in NA
[1:53:42] N3llee: 500k are bots but
[1:53:45] N3llee: thats confirmed
[1:53:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: half of that is bots
[1:53:57] WingsDub: ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù
[1:53:58] Deadelus0: New World should just scale up the lower level dungeons. Allow players to earn expertise in those! I've never seen some of them...
[1:53:59] ginironatatsujin: 500k bots monkaS
[1:54:01] nilachip: it's going down no worries
[1:54:01] N3llee: Look at the last ban wave thurs
[1:54:02] morp1onz: Yeah "people"
[1:54:06] Frank4LuLz: im a BOT
[1:54:15] mateolaa: more then wildstar FeelsBadMan
[1:54:16] Mozzeyy_: @towelliee have you played destiny 2
[1:54:17] Moobot: zookabang, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[1:54:17] PToastman: Feelings Kappa
[1:54:23] emznev: lost ark is meh
[1:54:26] Nin3r101: Nin3r101 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[1:54:27] N3llee: 300k players now.. but like nbew world people fed upo with the bullshit
[1:54:31] N3llee: you stop playing a month ago
[1:54:31] mrwaddles22: i play lost ark everyday....its the firrst time ive felt an mmo be constantly alive everyday
[1:54:35] Tecni: @mateolaa Sadge
[1:54:36] N3llee: its gotten 10 times worse
[1:54:37] Deadcells: Still too late to get into lost ark? I was too into WoW at the time to wrap my head around it
[1:54:49] Gingerprimer: IF LA is failed then games like POE are dead
[1:55:03] Kriven: I just hated the gearing system in lost ark. Game was fun overall and I enjoyed it I just like getting upgrades from dungeons and enjoying loot drops not just rolling dice on a upgrade
[1:55:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: ive heard there are massive que times in NA west servers even in the morning
[1:55:20] N3llee: @Gingerprimer they have nothing to do with each other.. completely dumb to think this
[1:55:27] mavericks312: @Gingerprimer will never fail just cause of asia alone
[1:55:34] Mecabeast: imo more than 10%  being bots doesnt make sense to me
[1:55:50] Gingerprimer: MY point is LA is not dead

[1:55:55] Sheppp: LUL.  i just q's WSG on TBCC after nto playing for a while.  Was getting flamed by my team hard for only having 5k hp and 0 res
[1:56:05] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  time wlkaing DOES start this week too
[1:56:18] N3llee: its been a shit league for poe.. no one is really playing
[1:56:21] Nostoroth: + console
[1:56:40] N3llee: i mean 3 leagues ago they had 200k players
[1:56:40] Ertra: Cataclysm Time Walking starts today, @Towelliee  so leveling will be easier
[1:56:46] mavericks312: doesnt PoE have a high entry ceiling?
[1:56:49] maxkule: When is POE 2?
[1:56:54] N3llee: if you include kr and russia
[1:56:59] DeanoTV: My mate is playing this league and got 180 EX D:
[1:57:13] brewgamingtv: PoE isn't for everyone tbh
[1:57:14] temp3st98: P OMEGALUL E
[1:57:18] Gingerprimer: @maxkule I have seen late next year or 2024
[1:57:20] morp1onz: @mavericks312 Not at all lol
[1:57:28] Nostoroth: im 8kish in PoE still have to use wiki
[1:57:41] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee Cata timewalking tho
[1:57:42] brewgamingtv: i have 5k+ hours in it and can tell you I've had buddy try it and they have a hard time with it
[1:57:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: playing PoE without a path of building build mapped out is practically impossible for new players
[1:57:49] Eithos87: the first big guy you fight in poe you need to hit and run
[1:57:51] Kriven: i cannot wait for D4 I was excited for it to begin with but the recent info drop has me ready
[1:57:54] ShadowDMG6969: POE is literally the Hard Mode of MMOs
[1:57:56] mavericks312: @morp1onz from what ive heard and seen what your sayign isnt true
[1:57:59] Sheppp: @o_illusionz same.  i can only play with a build guide or im dead in act 3
[1:58:00] Snabido: Is that the mythic difficulty in that game? Kappa
[1:58:10] PokerFaceMoose: less grind to lvel would be nice
[1:58:17] procyon_mfc: it is lookin good
[1:58:21] 91Niki: I would never have gotten into it if it wasn‚Äôt for Gattz helping me. Still it‚Äôs difficult for me to figuring out gearing stuff
[1:58:22] LoseAlotLuke: Necro looks so good
[1:58:27] DeanoTV: The paragon board/tree looks goood
[1:58:30] Rexialiton: I thought about trying PoE out. But I can't do it
[1:58:34] mavericks312: i will say i hit 60 in immortal last night gameplay and what not was really good for a mobile game
[1:58:36] procyon_mfc: they did drop a quartelerly update - did you see that too
[1:58:44] N3llee: cautiously optimistic about D4. The fact been no mention of hardcore worries me
[1:58:48] Kriven: i saw that snake of fire spell and my choice was sealed. Sorcerer I go
[1:58:50] PurplePyrex: @o_illusionz a lot of people use build guides to this day in current league. You'll get to the point where you can make a build without a guide.
[1:58:54] procyon_mfc: yah it focuses on necro
[1:58:58] ShadowDMG6969: Necromancer is a Good class to play if you like Crusader
[1:59:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: @91Niki i was following a youtube guide to making a bow and I still got confused and did it wrong
[1:59:01] brewgamingtv: if u try PoE i think having a friend that plays it can easy things up just a bit
[1:59:15] morp1onz: @mavericks312 You take a build guide and follow it, how is that hard, I'm not talking about the trader recipes
[1:59:22] Rexialiton: I'm gonna play the shit out of D4 when it releases
[1:59:37] duffluv22: Did you buy the heirloom scouting maps??
[1:59:37] Moobot: üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[1:59:38] Deadcells: I hope they consistently drop content updates for Diablo 4. Asmon made a point of how D3 didn‚Äôt get brought content updates and I kinda agree with him.
[1:59:44] 91Niki: @haxorjimduggan yeah crafting is super complex, end game gearing
[1:59:59] DeanoTV: They said they will support D4 with expansions and cosmetics for years
[2:00:00] EpicBananners: I like POE but there is TOO much in the game which is weird to say
[2:00:03] Secondbreakfasttt: tabula :D
[2:00:04] brewgamingtv: tabula
[2:00:05] DeanoTV: heres hoping
[2:00:05] Eithos87: tabula rossa
[2:00:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: did you watch all the videos of the necromancer in the d4 quarter update?
[2:00:09] BadCarma89: tabula rasa
[2:00:12] mellzor: d3 hype
[2:00:18] Gingerprimer: @Deadcells tbf that is prob why they have the cosmetic store to support post launch content
[2:00:23] EpicBananners: tabula hype
[2:00:29] Domini1001: @Towelliee  Towel bro are you gonna play wrath and if yes  are you gonna play it like TBC or properly?
[2:00:36] Rudric_Ice: PoE is just way too complicated to get into and I didn't wanted to look up guides on my first play through I got overwhelmed and I quit LUL
[2:00:42] ShadoodHD: i saw haps playing d3 necro and he's just pumping corpse explosion lol
[2:00:45] abracka_: diablo 3 is pretty enjoyable to play casually every few months
[2:00:47] EpicBananners: i can't bring myself to play immortal so I fired up d3 as well
[2:00:53] Deadcells: I hope D4 eventually has like 10 or more classes.
[2:00:59] Domini1001: @Towelliee  you didnt really play TBC thats what i mean
[2:01:00] 91Niki: D3 is fun for sure
[2:01:14] 91Niki: I‚Äôve been tempted to play through d3 cuz of DI
[2:01:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they put D3 on sale i would play, but i dont want to spend $35 to get expansion and necromancer
[2:01:40] Rudric_Ice: will you start on a fresh server ??
[2:02:12] warrenny: @rudric_ice Why not its prob the best experience
[2:02:21] EpicBananners: play d3 with no necro, i still dont have it and d3 day 1 buyer
[2:02:26] 210Crawler: yeah, will you start a Hammer Squad on a fresh server
[2:03:26] Nostoroth: classic legion when
[2:03:26] Gingerprimer: Streamer guilds dies instantly as soon as the streamer play anything else for a week or 2
[2:03:38] Gingerprimer: @Nostoroth based
[2:03:39] PokerFaceMoose: fresh servers should be great
[2:03:46] PokerFaceMoose: what we wanted for tbc
[2:03:48] 91Niki: @Gingerprimer Pretty much. People rarely function without the streamer, which is sad
[2:03:50] Kriven: i loved wrath but my thing is I loved in 2007 sorta been there done that. Im more excited for dragonflight
[2:04:00] jerexify: I barely touched BC Classic. What happened with the Hammer Squad guild?

[2:04:14] Finiin: what addon is that that tells you what buff you get for the encrypted buffs?
[2:04:16] PokerFaceMoose: lol
[2:04:20] NieIas: looking forwards to asmon's video on how Wotlk will suck
[2:04:28] Gingerprimer: fresh servers will still have the same problem since after 90 days ppl with tons of gold will just transfer over

[2:07:06] PurplePyrex: @91 im already on it, continuing to level my current season character
[2:07:15] Blvdman: earth ele op
[2:07:16] 91Niki: @PurplePyrex Nice :D
[2:07:16] Ertra: its a shaman healer, of course they did 10k
[2:08:01] Eithos87: deckard cain? are you on campaign?
[2:08:15] Gingerprimer: Elemental to pick up the adds for %
[2:08:18] 91Niki: BF2042 is actually fun right now, plus the fact that this beast of a laptop I got runs it really well. My poor desktop at home can barely get 70fps LUL My laptop gets 90-100 fps
[2:08:26] Ertra: no if you're on the season mode, you play adventure mode
[2:08:39] ShadowDMG6969: @eithos87 you have to run the campaign first with a Seasonal Character
[2:08:39] Sollice: @towelliee your playing D3?  You doing on stream I would play D3 again
[2:08:41] Eithos87: adventure mode the whole time. no one touches campaign
[2:08:48] ShadowDMG6969: Season 26 lol
[2:08:49] SidecarShrimp: you can do both, calm down chat x)
[2:08:52] Gingerprimer: TBF you can do both if you just want to have fun
[2:08:56] Kriven: I will say it was pretty cool to see the president of blizzard streaming the xbox show and talking about the upcoming games with chat
[2:09:02] Nostoroth: anything new in season 26?
[2:09:28] N3llee: no
[2:09:30] N3llee: d3 is ass
[2:09:31] Ertra: @Nostoroth theres a new activity... echoing nightmares
[2:09:33] ShadowDMG6969: But you need to run Campaign to get the Challeneges for certain things done
[2:09:36] Eithos87: wave based content called echoing nightmares
[2:09:39] JediNeo99999: 27* There's a new endgame mode that is becoming permanent.
[2:09:44] N3llee: they would have to turn the season on head and do somethign new
[2:09:44] mavericks312: isnt d3 trash can juice
[2:09:52] blossomcamm: D3 is fun for what it is imo
[2:09:56] N3llee: to get anyone to try it out for
[2:10:00] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[2:10:04] 91Niki: D3 is fun imo
[2:10:16] Gingerprimer: D3 is pretty good and fun
[2:10:16] N3llee: @91Niki for 5 days
[2:10:17] ShadowDMG6969: D3 is a great time
[2:10:18] Ertra: D3 is fun... i play till about 750 paragon every season
[2:10:22] Sollice: Yea it is. Now I will have to install it
[2:10:23] PurplePyrex: i got the pet and wings from having Diablo Immortal
[2:10:24] dreamwalker213: I enjoy D3 as a game to play for a few days every once in awhile
[2:10:24] jpopei: how soon is WotLK beta
[2:10:32] 91Niki: @91Niki A little more than that, but yeah it burns you out quick
[2:10:37] Vondem: Doesn't the fox boy fixate?
[2:10:40] ShadowDMG6969: D3 is most fun with friends tho TBH
[2:10:41] uziel_rl: @ShadowDMG6969 Endlessly farming rifts is fun? I am confusion
[2:10:45] Mojojojodota: Threat thing wasn¬¥t close to enough
[2:10:53] Eithos87: the last few seasons I got to paragon 3k+ but taking a season off
[2:10:59] blossomcamm: season 26 has some new endgame thing I don't remember exactly tho
[2:11:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: i started leveling the psijic in eso last night, all ready regretting it LUL
[2:11:22] N3llee: they havent changed the meta or done anything to d3 to "refresh: it in several season.. doubt they will dedicate any resources to it for anything.
[2:11:30] thisgamesucks99: I think DH damage plays a big part of its threat
[2:11:39] ShadowDMG6969: @uziel_rl it's not just Rifts ya run you do plenty of other stuff & once you get bored with a character ya switch to a new one & do that for a bit
[2:11:56] thisgamesucks99: They kinda changed tanking in that there‚Äôs less threes
[2:12:04] thisgamesucks99: Threat causing abilities
[2:12:15] Gingerprimer: Maybe not this one but one closer to launcher
[2:12:18] Nostoroth: im bored Downloading D3 atm
[2:12:32] Rexialiton: EU?
[2:12:33] Aevas: how long has season got left in D3 atm?
[2:12:36] Moobot: ifish4sharks, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[2:12:41] N3llee: they would have to changed up season meta.. no reason to play.. its been the same
[2:12:48] blossomcamm: I can't do poe to complicated for brain way to many systems and shit
[2:12:55] ShadowDMG6969: I mean it's also fun getting Set Items to run their unique Dungeons
[2:12:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: problem is d3 makes them no money except for the direct sales, with d4 having a skin shop they have a way to make money to make more content
[2:13:02] blossomcamm: and I hate playing through the story over and over for each season
[2:13:14] Eithos87: still waiting on the next ptr then it will be about a month after
[2:13:17] Kriven: @N3llee he isn't talking about the people that play it on the regular he is saying people are more likely to dive in again after the recent hype of d4
[2:13:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: why make content if you are not gonna make money off it
[2:13:24] Gingerprimer: @blossomcamm just do adventure mode then
[2:13:24] DeanoTV: I'd rather grind rifts to level again in D3 than do the story over and over in POE
[2:13:42] ifish4sharks: They will just focus on Immortal for the dolla dolla bills yall
[2:13:45] blossomcamm: @gingerprimer sorry I'm talking poe leagues I wish poe had a adventure mode lol
[2:13:51] ShadoodHD: oh god they make you repeat the story in poe? monkaS
[2:14:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: @ShadoodHD every time
[2:14:06] Eithos87: no
[2:14:08] PsychoWarren: @blossomcamm you only have to do story once you can skip it

[2:14:48] Finiin: yea you can be level 1 and them
[2:14:50] PurplePyrex: technically you can do rifts and bounties at level 1
[2:14:51] PsychoWarren: @blossomcamm oh lol
[2:14:53] ifish4sharks: I run the story until 19 to get the Leorics crown and then go bounties
[2:14:58] abracka_: depending on how far into the season it is, you can just get boosted by another player. you'll hit max level in like, 30 minutes it's insane lol
[2:14:59] procyon_mfc: at character creation select adventure mode
[2:15:11] ShadowDMG6969: @towelliee you can do story which is needed for Challenges to get the Seaonal Set items or Cosmetics, Most people skip over campaign & do Adventures
[2:15:14] NotEnoughMana: do nephalem rifts at 'hard' difficulty (adventure mode)
[2:15:16] thisgamesucks99: I just started grinding in Diablo, but haven‚Äôt played it a ton
[2:15:22] DeCoyThatGuy: dont you have to complete the storyline 1 time before you get to bounty and rifts?
[2:15:26] EpicBananners: you want to do the challenge rift, then go to adventure mode and grab the cube at lvl1. from there its kinda whatever you want
[2:15:30] ifish4sharks: stil can
[2:15:30] Ertra: yeah, it's there, trust us
[2:15:39] Finiin: it's the same seasonal or not
[2:15:41] 91Niki: Towelliee it works like the stuff in Shadowlands. You can choose story of WQ kinda mode
[2:15:48] Shearkahn: I swore you had to finish the story once and then each season you can just adventure mode
[2:15:52] JediNeo99999: If you have someone that can do wave 150 in the echoing nightmare I think you can almost get to 70 in one run if not higher
[2:15:52] 91Niki: story or WQ
[2:15:52] Eithos87: you can even wear a lvl 70 weapon at lvl 40
[2:16:12] EpicBananners: @JediNeo99999 just once ever, I actually downloaded and did it yesterday
[2:16:27] Rodenbo: you guys are funny in the sense that you don't understand how confusing some of what is being said to someone that' snever played the game
[2:16:53] Shearkahn: @Towelliee Then you're good
[2:17:00] ShadowDMG6969: Diablo is it's own unique fuck around find out Fandom
[2:17:02] Finiin: D3 seasons are great, esp if the seasonal buff is a good one
[2:17:04] thisgamesucks99: Depth of the game is what made it the genre
[2:17:07] king_julian_96: Towelliee with the internal alpha  for dragonflight hitting the blizzard catalogue does this mean  dragonflight alpha is only a week or 2 away
[2:17:30] 91Niki: @Towelliee in the menu, when you first hit play on the character, you can choose adventure mode or story mode. Similar to when you get to Oribos in Shadowlands on alts
[2:17:30] veryhairyheyyall: I‚Äôm loving immortal right now
[2:17:43] Eithos87: the fastest I've leveled from 1 to 70 is 6 seconds
[2:17:50] Armdel: i actually opened up diablo for the first time in like 2 years last night, thinking i might level a new character for fun
[2:18:03] Ertra: !df
[2:18:06] NieIas: !alpha
[2:18:06] Moobot: @NieIas PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[2:18:16] 91Niki: We'll have D4 beta before we'll have DragonFlight beta :p
[2:18:21] Bennymonkey: !df
[2:18:25] Rodenbo: @Armdel and then you realized the game designers have determined what build you're going to play based on item sets
[2:18:49] mavericks312: i also dont think there sticking to any timeline as well
[2:18:55] Rottencoarse: @91Niki  we might
[2:19:06] 91Niki: We just got the signups so I see it happening
[2:19:07] EpicBananners: is DF confirmed this year?
[2:19:11] EpicBananners: nevermind then
[2:19:17] Armdel: D4 beta signups went live, so im guessing its not too far off
[2:19:25] mavericks312: @EpicBananners hell no lol
[2:19:28] 91Niki: I signed up for D4 beta the other day
[2:19:30] Rottencoarse: @EpicBananners both d4 and DF is 2023
[2:19:31] N3llee: monkey poxx delay 100%
[2:19:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna go full tyrone biggums when those d4 beta keys drop
[2:19:45] orionshadow: Towellie done with Diablo immortal already? I probably missed any video/explanation
[2:19:55] swinging_monk: Do u think dragon flight late next year?
[2:20:00] ShadoodHD: but i don't want to choose between the two if it's overlapping each other :<
[2:20:05] blossomcamm: if I get any sort of beta for a blizzard game D4 is what I want
[2:20:07] EpicBananners: they said wotlk and I heard both :(
[2:20:14] Rodenbo: @orionshadow He's probably done having a game beg him to spend money
[2:20:19] 91Niki: @ShadoodHD I doubt Blizzard would let them overlap
[2:20:20] king_julian_96: well i just think they have to realese the dragonflight alpha soon if they still want to realese dragonflight march of next year
[2:20:24] blossomcamm: And the only beta I got for a blizzard game was classic LUL
[2:20:24] ghost186_: Did you finish Quarry?
[2:20:49] 91Niki: Blizzard knows their player base plays both. Beta's usually don't overlap
[2:20:53] Finiin: the only beta I got in was for BFA lol
[2:21:34] racketpunch: Fresh servers should remain transfer free permanently

[2:23:28] ShadoodHD: DI kinda hit the nail on mobile a little too well LUL
[2:23:33] Aevas: In Immortal can you get the best stuff being f2p?
[2:23:35] king_julian_96: well if alpha is like a motnh away then blizzard trying to push for march next year at this point is a big ask which means it's probably not going to be until april next year now at this point
[2:23:39] ghost186_: Did you see Asmon quite Diablo Immortal video?
[2:23:39] mavericks312: the ones you see spending over 1k is doing it just for the content

[2:24:31] Subjektive: 17 sanguine but i could drop it to a 15 if you want
[2:24:34] Noni0ne: I can't believe that after so much time, I just now started playing wow and it's so much fun
[2:24:40] EpicBananners: its about $$/hr of game played IMO and not just how much overall. I've spent so much on wow subs but I get a lot of time back out of that
[2:24:58] Naturalbeef: Do you need the best gear?
[2:24:59] veryhairyheyyall: ^
[2:25:30] dwolf010: df pre orders when?

[2:25:47] KonceptionZ: 15 spires
[2:25:51] Velashen: When you have the best gear there is no reason to play anymore really. It‚Äôs the journey as well.
[2:26:01] Naturalbeef: Like you said, people like to pretend they are the top 1% gamers
[2:26:12] Mojojojodota: reprisal + unity
[2:26:19] Zeke_nl: boots belt
[2:26:35] Rudric_Ice: its about the fun not the journey
[2:27:05] griffdog125: if you can dps i got a 14 gambit but i'm a tank
[2:27:19] PhillyDilly18: Holy crap you can upgrade the belt to 291?? I'm so silly
[2:27:26] dwolf010: when do you think we will get df pre order ?
[2:27:32] Zeke_nl: people are just weird
[2:27:33] EpicBananners: the people fixated on DI have never been exposed to mobile gaming before
[2:27:45] Zippaya: man, I enjoy more watching your stream than playing myself :D

[2:28:14] king_julian_96: so with alpha for dragonflight coming out in abotu a month does that mean dragonflight won't realese in march now and realese in april instead or is it still possible to launch march
[2:28:18] PhillyDilly18: @griffdog125 Ahhh, okay. Thank you for the information!
[2:28:29] brewgamingtv: but no server paragon lserver limit shit

[2:28:49] veryhairyheyyall: I agree towel
[2:28:56] Blackminuz: you forgot your gold
[2:29:00] ShadoodHD: immortal is a good lesson for blizzard, especially if they want to settle some sort of income other than relying on direct sales from customers
[2:29:01] im_your_innerdemon: the worldboss from d4 looked sick
[2:29:01] dwolf010: @towelliee when do you expect df pre order?

[2:32:51] Rudric_Ice: i kinda hate the mentality if the streamer hates the game i'll hate it too fuck off try it out and judge it for yourself
[2:33:29] Finiin: I'm fine with DF being awhile away, I have plenty of games in my back log to play
[2:33:43] Choowey: @Rudric_Ice Yeah Morbius was actually good
[2:34:09] Tauren0309: Why do you not buy the LVL 60 Renown from the vendor in oribos?

[2:38:03] abracka_: the pvp boxes give you 249 ilvl, but when you convert it to tier it drops down to 236 ilvl
[2:38:13] Rottencoarse: yes
[2:38:14] QuigsTV: @towelliee the gear you buy with valor can still be upgarded
[2:38:20] QuigsTV: upgraded*

[2:38:37] Blvdman: in AH
[2:38:55] twaldy: chance for bis weapon or trinket
[2:39:00] Blvdman: sandworn relics take too damn long to accumulate anyways
[2:39:02] abracka_: honestly don't even know why it's 236 ilvl. isn't the max ilvl jumping in a few weeks when S4 starts?
[2:39:08] Eithos87: ok time to mow before reset
[2:39:16] Sinvin: Sinvin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[2:39:26] Rottencoarse: @abracka_  yeah it jumps to 300 if i'm not wrong
[2:39:29] TheTimoBern: i wanna be able to send flux between toons. have 50k on main and cant get mogs on others because farming the flux takes so long
[2:39:42] Elff11: I want them to write an blue post essay size where they announce acc wide everything
[2:39:49] NVbrutal: @abracka_  season 4 is prolly still a month or 2 away.
[2:40:13] Mecabeast: by the time you grind 300 sandworm relics youll have better gear than 246
[2:40:13] Choowey: I just want a way to send cosmic flux, no point in everything else being easy to finish if I'm still gated by flux for playing alts
[2:40:15] Rottencoarse: yeah 2k per leggo for 291 sadly
[2:40:18] Tauren0309: Does the Vendor in ZM not sell the Flux box to make Lego's?
[2:40:25] SirAlex1993: what class would you like to see the talent tree of next?

[2:52:53] Rockaruu: aha:) i loved Wotlk :)
[2:53:10] cassetto: bfa was my second best time in wow
[2:53:16] mrniceguy817: Oof bfa is bottom tier for me I was not a fan of that x pac borrowed power
[2:53:39] warrenny: @mrniceguy817 Bfas third after legion then sl
[2:53:43] cassetto: one word: TWILIGHT DEVASTATION
[2:53:49] RagingPunk: the end of bfa went crazy
[2:53:50] Finiin: BFA is bad for me mostly cause I lost my mom during it
[2:53:58] Nostoroth: 2 words buddy
[2:54:02] ghost186_: Why do people hate BFA so much then?
[2:54:06] warrenny: 8.2 sucked but other then that
[2:54:09] Epixil: what does fresh mean? sorry if dumb
[2:54:14] RagingPunk: they did announce fresh though
[2:54:17] ReyleonTV: Did you play Classic/TBC at all?
[2:54:18] cassetto: @Nostoroth  you're right LOL
[2:54:25] PhantomX_Destiny: @Towelliee what happened in BC?
[2:54:25] SirAlex1993: do you think that Pristine servers and their backlash was justified?
[2:54:30] Mecabeast: what ive seen of quarry reminds me of all those 80s and 90s slasher horror vibes
[2:54:32] therealbrigade: What problems did BFA have?
[2:54:41] stabzmcgeee: because WOW players have always hated whatever the current expac is
[2:54:41] Rulem: eh, its my least played xpac my a mile
[2:54:49] TiredCarcass: think i enjoyed mop the best
[2:54:50] tfors: bfa was okey
[2:55:03] veryhairyheyyall: I got really into pvp in bfa haha
[2:55:04] RagingPunk: i think cata is my fave pls dont shoot lol
[2:55:05] SSD511_: BFA was good
[2:55:08] Kriven: I will say even though shadowlands overall was meh for me Ardenweald, Bastion, and Revendreath were great from the art team.
[2:55:14] Velashen: BFA had fun leveling but had a bad story and not everyone liked the gearing.
[2:55:15] kokochris: I enjoyed BFA.
[2:55:19] warrenny: Bod was fantastic
[2:55:22] lumaday: neck and cloak catchup was rough
[2:55:24] JediNeo99999: azerite armor was pretty bad and getting certain essences and leveling some of them
[2:55:30] therealbrigade: I think I remember hearing people kinda annoying with the sylvannas stuff
[2:55:34] RolexKT: It doesn't help that legion was MY first expansion, so going from legion to bfa was a rough transition just because I loved it so much
[2:55:45] FussyQBert: the theme of BFA was a bit weird coming right off legion
[2:55:57] zeitgeiz: They weren‚Äôt fixed in BoD lol. I couldn‚Äôt play an spriest because I couldn‚Äôt afford to respec my azerite for st/aoe so I stopped playing.
[2:56:00] ghost186_: Corruptions sucked. The one shot mechanics where not good in pvp
[2:56:03] tfors: i was having ton of fun with corruption
[2:56:09] RagingPunk: mechagon zone was cool
[2:56:12] egraves7: i just wish they'd added the vendor way sooner
[2:56:13] veryhairyheyyall: Corruption was insane..
[2:56:16] EpicBananners: rogues had something too that was nutty
[2:56:17] zeitgeiz: I don‚Äôt think azerite was ever fixed. Last patch was fun
[2:56:25] FussyQBert: that was sick
[2:56:30] Rulem: I quit way before they fixed all the broken acquisition methods
[2:56:31] Hypertitan: my problem was it just taking so long over the expansion to fix things
[2:56:33] FussyQBert: 2 good zones too imo
[2:56:41] Blvdman: actually i had a terrible experience with corruption as an Elemental Shaman. I found out my class doesn't scale well even if given crazy freedom to get 100% in a haste
[2:56:41] kashmara: What I liked in bfa was that you could get an alt geared up in like an hour with world quests.
[2:56:42] Kriven: I liked mechagon. Najatar was pretty but i hated moving around it till i got flying
[2:56:45] Elff11: Corruption was good times, I miss my MM hunter with stacking mastery so I could attack from 80yards :P
[2:56:46] Blvdman: in a stat*
[2:56:47] GiraffeHydra_: corruption should be added in every last patch, just let us fuck around and obliterate shit after the progression is done lol
[2:56:49] Mecabeast: locks running out of mana was peak
[2:56:52] therealbrigade: Shadowlands release was dope
[2:56:54] stabzmcgeee: like i said WOW players will always hate the current expac,,, we hated mop till legion- hated legion till bfa,, hated bfa till SL etc etc
[2:57:01] khrovaa: yeah
[2:57:02] Zeke_nl: yeah you can send boxes for both
[2:57:16] ghost186_: DOnt do it! Korthia sucks
[2:57:17] JediNeo99999: I would take SL over BFA 1000%
[2:57:21] Tauren0309: ZM Vendor was the quickest for me
[2:57:25] zeitgeiz: Even people saying they liked BFA never say ‚ÄúI really liked azerite armor‚Äù. It remained bad and unfun the whole expansion
[2:57:28] Scoodles91: 5.1k ash 1650 cynders per lego
[2:57:29] OhNoNotAgain: Corruption was fun until an infinite star proc'd during mauts reflect.
[2:57:29] Finiin: if you buy the box in ZM you only need 1 box per item
[2:57:31] Mecabeast: 650?
[2:57:36] Finiin: yes
[2:57:42] Finiin: it's account
[2:57:44] Hypertitan: I always end up quitting before they fix the "pain points"  I just wish they would fix those things faster for me
[2:57:48] Rottencoarse: zm vendor is not account bound
[2:57:58] khrovaa: its char bound
[2:57:59] GiraffeHydra_: @OhNoNotAgain then it became funny for everyone observing Kappa
[2:58:01] khrovaa: soulbound
[2:58:02] hottfuzz24: its not
[2:58:02] Rottencoarse: it's only 3k flux
[2:58:09] Tauren0309: I can remember I send stuff, but can be wrong have not done it for a while
[2:58:12] Kriven: @zeitgeiz I think azerite armor suffered from it not being as cool and fun to interact with as the weapons from legion
[2:58:23] censati0n_: you can buy that and then go to Korthia
[2:58:28] stabzmcgeee: the box itself isnt boa but you can send the mats it gives
[2:58:28] censati0n_: to exchange
[2:58:32] stabzmcgeee: in korthia
[2:58:44] censati0n_: 3300
[2:58:45] lumaday: 1650
[2:58:47] censati0n_: for both
[2:58:51] Scoodles91: 1650 per lego
[2:58:53] TarkosDesu: 1650 x 2
[2:58:54] thatguynamedjans: Yeah you have enough
[2:58:55] jerexify: 5150
[2:58:57] lumaday: 5150
[2:59:02] Maruika: god damn there is too much currency in wow
[2:59:08] TarkosDesu: soul ash i think  around 5000
[2:59:09] thatguynamedjans: oh for 2? you have enough for one I think
[2:59:14] zeitgeiz: @kriven oh for sure that was the case. Also suffered from the unfun traits being the best ones instead of getting what could have been talentish options. Class traits were so bad for most classes
[2:59:27] Kriven: @zeitgeiz yup
[2:59:28] Rottencoarse: 5150 soul ash and 1650 cinders for 1 leggo @Towelliee
[2:59:28] jerexify: 10300 Soul Ash and 3300 Soul Cinders and 4000 Cosmic Flux for two 291 legendaries.

[3:09:03] Rinx21: just have to run your own keys
[3:09:03] OnePlayerPete: You can make your own group right?
[3:09:07] RunningOutOfRAM: oooooooooof my dude why y must speak the truth and hurt me that way D
[3:09:07] mrniceguy817: Sadly I do it all the time
[3:09:09] RunningOutOfRAM: D:
[3:09:09] 91Niki: Welcome to our suffering LUL
[3:09:11] dimofodi: my fav is when you get accepted in to a group and you take a portal and they kick you before the load screen even finishes
[3:09:19] Blvdman: its why wow doesnt get new players tbh lol
[3:10:16] RunningOutOfRAM: OOOOOOOOOOF so TRUE
[3:10:46] TombStoneMercenary: The gatekeeping is killing retail/classic.
[3:10:56] mrniceguy817: Naw the best is getting invited and only needing a tank you were the last dps invited and a tank with a dps queue up fl0mPls
[3:10:57] Mecabeast: starting mid patch is probably the hardest too
[3:11:13] Ralvay: maybe 10 man raids fix it
[3:11:22] Rudric_Ice: one wipe everyone leaves
[3:11:34] stabzmcgeee: how many keys did you do tonight? 3-4,,, ive been signing up to everything in my key range and havnt got into 1
[3:11:36] RunningOutOfRAM: yep ... fuck WOW xD
[3:11:38] PvtHudson093: I spent an hour trying to get into a 20 the other night
[3:11:41] stratiss: yeah i cant believe so many people play the game like that
[3:11:53] mavericks312: 9-5 especially as a dps is rough
[3:12:03] hottfuzz24: 9-5
[3:12:04] hottfuzz24: ?
[3:12:07] stabzmcgeee: try playing non meta on top of that
[3:12:07] Sneekzx: WoW started off as a casual MMO, most people never got to Naxx and that was perfectly fine. The game now has become all about min/maxing which has ruined the casual experience.
[3:12:09] Maruika: how many timewalking dungeons to go from 50-60 these days ?!
[3:12:12] 91Niki: !9to5
[3:12:14] smashwow: even if you had joined a guild. most guilds. pug still
[3:12:15] Rudric_Ice: everyone should play tanks
[3:12:17] dimofodi: nah, joining a guild and working your way in to keys with decent groups is just as rough as finder lol
[3:12:20] 91Niki: Oh the command is gone rip
[3:12:22] Rudric_Ice: learn tanking
[3:12:30] Syllvn: @Rudric_Ice People are awful to learning tanks
[3:12:35] rockmaniak: @Towelliee is Zygor paid addon good?
[3:13:06] Rudric_Ice: @Rudric_Ice its blizzard's fault they should have a good tutorial for tanks
[3:13:11] Mecabeast: i thought echo site had it
[3:13:16] Aquadriel: lmao i pirated zygor back in the day
[3:13:23] SirAlex1993: just go to mythictrap. WoWhead is more focused on retweeting and reposting the same article
[3:13:24] rockmaniak: why :D
[3:13:39] stratiss: zygor was great for classic leveling
[3:13:50] The_Metal_Man: @rockmaniak theres an addon called azeroth auto pilot thats good for levelling in retail that does the same thing pretty much
[3:13:55] Aquadriel: its decent addon but not worth the money with how easy lvling is now in wow
[3:14:28] PvtHudson093: Blizz hurry and release the rest of the classes talents]
[3:14:28] Kriven: LOL: The 'Joker' sequel will be a musical starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga-- the musical part has to be false right?
[3:14:36] 91Niki: zygor is great if you wanna avoid thinking while leveling. besides that, meh. there is free addons that helps with anything else in terms of achivs, mounts and stuff
[3:15:03] Rudric_Ice: lol ?
[3:15:04] procyon_mfc: That's an Onion thing
[3:15:04] mavericks312: lady gaga as harley quinn is gonna be so bad
[3:15:05] xluckydawgx: @Kriven Nope its real
[3:15:07] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah lol i read that as well
[3:15:13] 91Niki: Yeah it's all over the internet. No clue if confirmed or not
[3:15:20] xluckydawgx: They did not want to do a sequel, this is them proving that lol
[3:15:27] Ralvay: seems not many options same as old days. so you can't actually have your own build.
[3:15:30] Syllvn: Lady gaga is a great actress tbf
[3:15:31] Moobot: üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[3:15:35] Mallaes: Balance talents
[3:15:42] akia03: you get 2 auto
[3:15:46] Scoodles91: unselect the balance talents
[3:15:47] 91Niki: @simplySylvan Agreed!
[3:15:49] azanarzx: what website is this

[3:16:31] Nostoroth: make maul passive
[3:16:44] Shearkahn: ^^ after a crit
[3:16:57] The_Metal_Man: wait but maul isnt thrash, why would we press it KEKW

[3:28:07] thedeadliestcoil: u can take 1 point off from  front of pack
[3:28:08] ArcaneSyntax: I don't even play these two classes but I've spent like 3 hours messing with these trees
[3:28:15] Roaringkittylol: It's adding a layer of depth to the classes we haven't had in a long time. Something that PoE does on steroids but is very satisfying.
[3:28:20] Misosoup92: hope we can play with different builds

[3:34:33] captivate7: guardian is gonna be fun lol
[3:34:34] Deadelus0: :-(
[3:34:35] Zippaya: untill they nerf it as usual
[3:34:44] Roren091: im loving the new talent system
[3:34:59] nephuhlim: the link says there's a spare point on the left column
[3:35:00] eatonaround: it gave me a spare point when i loaded the tree from the link too

[3:35:11] DeanoTV: these trees will change so much during alpha beta
[3:35:43] The_Metal_Man: so just like live :)
[3:35:51] Snabido: @DeanoTV Yeah, I can see interrupt being one of the last talents, too OP early on Keepo
[3:36:17] Roren091: this will fix my ocd, i dont want no frost skills on my fire mage! xD
[3:36:31] Snabido: Add or remove a line here and there

[3:37:16] akia03: but how would class trees work with pure dps classes
[3:37:18] duffluv22: Frost tank again???
[3:37:20] Misosoup92: did you do dk already tow?
[3:37:22] Zippaya: this tree, plus some legos, item sets or something, looks nice
[3:37:35] The_Metal_Man: JPC's legendary bear build
[3:37:54] Rulem: and then add back all the actual tanking points lol
[3:37:59] Mecabeast: w.e build thats on wowhead/icyveins
[3:38:11] Rulem: because those guys will be all in on damage
[3:38:13] mavericks312: WoW bear's have more offense then the chicago bear's lol
[3:38:17] Gideonhawke: Theory crafting will be so much fun!
[3:38:17] chukudu: they will do it for "UI/Talents for subs only" Kappa
[3:38:19] mwchaos: theres so much good stuff in the bdk tree
[3:38:22] mwchaos: all over the place
[3:38:39] danimoto10: when the beta is coming dammit
[3:38:39] highlydegen: DK doesn‚Äôt feel finished compared to Druid tree honestly
[3:38:42] danimoto10: alpha*
[3:39:01] kappaday23: Keepo
[3:39:02] Gideonhawke: Will these tree's go live in the pre patch?
[3:39:12] kappaday23: yes
[3:39:35] Roaringkittylol: Where are you finding this?
[3:39:41] smashwow: the party wide consumption was the strong one
[3:39:43] SirAlex1993: so we wont have the last 5 points in the tree
[3:39:55] Misosoup92: @Towelliee cmon towell tell them to post the pally one!
[3:40:00] Bmcadoo07: just getting here is there a date for pre-patch?
[3:40:31] thedeadliestcoil: look at the last points
[3:40:31] Shirey36: voracious
[3:40:43] NVbrutal: consumption prolly for M+, blood drinker for raids
[3:40:47] The_Metal_Man: tombstone prob still cause you get our 4p
[3:40:54] Rulem: do you think there is still a chance of complete spec overhauls?
[3:40:59] mwchaos: tombstone
[3:41:01] The_Metal_Man: CRW is still there too
[3:41:25] The_Metal_Man: if its like live we're absolute paper without DRW so CRW + the 4p at the bottom is probably mandatory
[3:41:38] Zippaya: ofc
[3:41:43] doomdrake13: Do we have a link to this talent calculator?
[3:41:45] kokochris: that doesnt always make alot of sense.  the gear you have or can obtain will also dictate your tree a bit.  as well as play style.
[3:41:46] Rulem: I honestly don't think so.  They will go 100% damage on tanks and most of us, and our healers, won't be able to pull it off
[3:41:59] captivate7: the best part about this, is customization. messing and learning your build the way you want
[3:42:02] Shirey36: work smarter not harder is my motto....i let the theory crafters do their thing for me
[3:42:02] calvinandhobbes811: When‚Äôs hunter tree coming out? :(
[3:42:03] PvtHudson093: Not everyone will be able to maximise those giga builds
[3:42:05] chukudu: I will have the best build in the world by having 60 points in each tree Kappa
[3:42:09] thelordyeet: servers are up
