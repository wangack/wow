[0:16:05] beckstaaaa: ahhhh late night stream for us in the UK! love it hazelLove
[0:16:18] saga_no: Someone put a Snapchat filter on that troll.
[0:16:21] jgbrit: We all know what happens when Hazel dies in HC, we go again, and again. I'm SO ready for this 'series'. I really missed you playing HC
[0:16:28] saga_no: and it's very uncanny valley
[0:16:42] McScooterson: LMAO
[0:16:46] cashthb: what do you mean traditionally hot?! it's literally a TROLL
[0:16:57] heldtheline: trolls canonically have moss growing on them

[0:18:54] xxrayniix: self found from what I understand is basically, you cant get items/gear from the aunction house/other players
[0:18:55] Madalynn: @viktorxcx it means you cant use the AH or trade gear with other players you have to find everything on your own I believe, i could be wrong

[0:20:55] cashthb: yeah, I don't think the badge is responsive
[0:21:20] harrybabes: have you thought about what pets you would like for her? harryb27KirbyShowLove
[0:21:30] kalithian2: @HazelNuttyGames question hazel, whats the self found mode?  whats it do?
[0:21:36] jeffdmk: sadly adibags is no longer getting updates, the creator is now working on betterbags which i like less

[0:24:05] jgbrit: This will be so much more challenging because you won't be able to get massive stam stat like Azhel as easily
[0:24:11] saga_no: Self Found is a box you tick to opt into when you create the character

[0:30:00] saga_no: FIshing?
[0:30:21] kalithian2: a bear or a cat
[0:30:57] GreenArrowed: i think you'll see cats first? other than boars.
[0:31:11] McScooterson: just saving up for mount I guess
[0:31:18] McScooterson: and spell training
[0:31:20] cashthb: crokolisks also eat those, and they have more legs
[0:31:37] eielwind: what IS the strat to make money in SSF
[0:31:57] saga_no: Vendor a bunch of stuff?
[0:32:57] wolfcloudchaser80: Petri potions are huge.
[0:32:59] cashthb: first aid tho?
[0:33:01] wolfcloudchaser80: Err, flask
[0:33:09] eielwind: oh yeah getting health pots is gonna be tough
[0:33:13] anker_jym: I'll absolutely be going Herb/Alch on my Warrior. Not taking any chances lol
[0:33:23] derrickbehunter: was so confused when I got the notification you went live this late lol
[0:34:28] itsparvati: wtb raid skips for old old raids
[0:34:54] saga_no: I think I would play a class with a self-heal, have First Aid, and herb/alch just to be safe
[0:35:07] saga_no: (I favor Boomkin for Classic/Wrath, so probably that... )

[0:36:41] PyahPyahPyahSoda: @eielwind no mail either :o
[0:36:43] eielwind: I’m surprised they allow grouping even
[0:36:44] apheelia96: so many players so few scorpions
[0:36:44] kalithian2: always a risk when grouping up in hardcore because in a group its possible to die because someone else messed up not you
[0:37:11] saga_no: If I'm not playing a plate toon, I'm not having BM on it, personally
[0:37:18] cardbross: Gathering in HCSF seems risky
[0:37:32] McScooterson: plus with blacksmithing you'd need a source of leather too
[0:38:25] Belle69142: i absolutely ADORE your hair
[0:38:48] saga_no: Did I see that right? Did you get a belt just now?
[0:38:53] HazelNuttyGames: !wig

[0:39:05] saga_no: Aah. ok
[0:39:27] danstink: are dungeons allowed?
[0:39:31] saga_no: Pardon the backseating - I was genuinely confused as to whether I saw it correctly or not for a second there
[0:39:56] m1lkman10: Do you know if the whole server is SSF?
[0:40:16] saga_no: SF is a checkbox you tick to opt into it
[0:40:22] danstink: I like that they didnt make more servers, keep the population together more activity.
[0:41:16] simetra: @AnAnonymousGifter Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:41:19] McScooterson: someday scan and repair will actually finish and work
[0:41:47] GreenArrowed: oooh that sounds good
[0:41:53] cardbross: caves when hyperspawn/repops happen are so deadly
[0:42:06] apheelia96: I feel like with no auction house I would need dungeons so that i could gear up ?

[0:42:51] jeffdmk: not a chance it gets you killed
[0:43:05] saga_no: brb
[0:43:06] jgbrit: You can't die. You owe it to Hellgrave to stay alive
[0:43:27] McScooterson: well there's one to redeem later so
[0:43:30] Triskelian: Peach schnapps is the best
[0:43:35] itsparvati: that mount <3
[0:43:37] Marmoh: It's been long enough where watching you play hardcore is so nostalgic
[0:43:52] Chrystarium: |Do you play any other games outside of wow-related ones?

[0:45:40] ahnn112: ooh troll femal kinda cool with the back hand swing
[0:45:43] McScooterson: oh man! the big pet news
[0:46:18] jgbrit: I play a BG yesterday and I didn't take any damage at all until it was just me and the last opponent. Sadly he decked me. I though I was about to have a flawless game
[0:46:58] foss1lstreams: I save scum plenty, because there is no penalty hazelTen
[0:47:08] apheelia96: just got pants with 17 armor woo hoo
[0:47:15] McScooterson: @jgbrit see, i thought this was going to be porcupette related
[0:47:33] jgbrit: Haha ^
[0:47:48] jgbrit: Oh yeah. Finally I got him too
[0:48:05] apheelia96: they dropped off a scorpion
[0:48:11] jgbrit: Literally 12 pet tamers every day from November until about 2 weeks ago
[0:48:27] jeffdmk: I killed 3k crabs this week and got a blacksmithing recipe that was pretty cool
[0:48:28] foss1lstreams: Talking of pets, currently fostering two cats. They refuse to let me do anything without giving them pets and cuddles. Incredibly cute and has made my week
[0:50:09] jgbrit: I was dragons in the BG, I was scaling like mad and I got the draconian enchanter quadrupling my end of turn scaling lol
[0:51:24] jgbrit: Sorry drakkari enchanter
[0:52:08] apheelia96: lmao
[0:52:31] jgbrit: I had everything getting divine shields at the start of the game and then getting loads of health at the end of my turn
[0:52:39] foss1lstreams: I've been playing HSBGs, is it becuase I want to buy pretty boards? Maybe
[0:53:17] m1lkman10: What professions are you gonna go?
[0:53:21] saga_no: .....aaaand back
[0:54:32] cervyvin: The most scary part of my HC journey was getting through loch modan as horde. Bought and strategized invis pots to get through.
[0:54:43] GreenArrowed: work work
[0:54:49] harrybabes: I always feel so mean doing this quest harryb27KirbySobbing
[0:54:57] eielwind: i always hated this peon quest when its crowded lol
[0:55:23] cervyvin: "go to sleep so I can bash you awake please" xD
[0:56:09] harrybabes: a goal? o.o
[0:56:20] saga_no: CAN you intervene in SF though?
[0:56:23] jgbrit: You need to bait someone into dying then LUL
[0:56:24] saga_no: Your goal just might happen
[0:56:24] imLoGiC1: hellooooo how are you :)
[0:56:43] cervyvin: at lvl 58 I grouped up with a rogue for an elite, and he died and I survived, felt so guilty
[0:57:22] Triskelian: "Me not that kind of orc!"
[0:58:20] harrybabes: I wish we could see what dogs are dreaming about
[0:59:58] watergoddess06: Self found is basically like trial account version for hard-core right?
[1:00:08] cardbross: deadzone is going to kill a lot of pre-pet hunters
[1:00:40] cervyvin: layer phasing is also deadly in caves
[1:01:40] cardbross: SoD layering is bad for world PvP, but so good for making the world feel alive
[1:03:22] cervyvin: mount grinding might be a chore also
[1:04:03] apheelia96: im not in the cave yet. im scared lol
[1:04:38] jgbrit: Are there any interesting final messages in deathlog
[1:04:40] traansfemme_goofyposter: we go agane

[1:22:13] apheelia96: man you are fast!
[1:22:31] saga_no: @eielwind I'm slowly acquiring it by doing unrated stuff and hoping for the best
[1:23:51] cardbross: farming for high value vendor trash since you can't AH anything is a new optimization problem I've never thought about before

[1:27:30] FeineeWildfireSirena: oh man, that should be baseline LUL
[1:27:32] bigbrockly: "special fun challenge" kekw
[1:27:49] Marmoh: People who hit 60 on SF should have a dragon elite on their portrait
[1:27:50] McScooterson: the coco channel method of addons
[1:28:12] cervyvin: hardcore was the mode that got my pulse up considerably several times, the fun kind of adrenaline
[1:28:18] Hippwn: a bright pink tallstrider is always great hahaha

[1:31:43] Hippwn: there is a pink and red hyena I had no clue
[1:32:20] wolfcloudchaser80: @cardbross I have good memories of my boar pinning down mobs quickly, yeah
[1:32:27] apheelia96: LUL
[1:32:30] saga_no: Classic boars do look a tad derpy, yeah
[1:32:35] lilley13: I loved my Helboar in BC

[1:32:49] saga_no: Like if you look at it head-on - they're giving *derp*
[1:32:51] cervyvin: I agree, but the "undead" boars in EP are the only ones that looks cool to me
[1:32:56] cardbross: I've always had a soft spot for the RFD armored necro-boar appearance
[1:33:00] Marmoh: "Set my hearse here"
[1:33:10] whatsupwithnick: i justy killed my level 2 character tabbed out of WoW LOL
[1:33:38] Ldy50: Plaguelands have boars that have flesh falling off them.  I wanted the uglist I could find

I think you’re incredible. I also think you’re one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen. you’re a wonderful person and deserve the world.

[1:45:09] McScooterson: raid logging just to not get the lego is so fun
