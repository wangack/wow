[0:50:46] Brewmaster_Holsten: Is it true that men who are negative about WoW are balding a lot quicker?
[0:51:15] tarnishedvalor: @TaliesinAndEvitel rosemary is great (i put a sprig in my conditioner)
[0:51:19] Nulgar: Preach started to like WoW again and also got his hair back tneEvi

[0:52:25] Melithian: Are you saying Shadowlands was a baldness epidemic?
[0:52:27] Ealdfox: I have really long hair and like WoW, theory confirmed
[0:52:28] elbardo_ts: what about mrgm?
[0:52:28] AlanC2024: Do either of your children like curries btw? Penny might be too young. :)

[0:53:31] dastago: probably the least stressful way to be
[0:53:33] Agatharn: news and non reactor?
[0:53:40] Garysteel1984: I'm 39 with a fine mane
[0:53:53] Reminii91: how 10.2.5 so far for you personally Tali?
[0:54:14] Ealdfox: It's the stress of all the hate, makes you bald
[0:54:15] AlanC2024: the more things you dislike must be stressful. No wonder people would go bald
[0:54:25] cardrenn: so it's a curse, not a blessing
[0:54:31] dastago: i'm 23 with long hair. my dad is in his late 40s and also still has pretty thick hair so i'm keeping my fingers crossed
[0:54:32] S3N71: @Garysteel1984 hello!

[0:55:14] Brukhalian: cortizone
[0:55:18] Zirconix: i was anti WoW when it first came out, i didnt view it as a "proper" rpg, also i was bald by 23. I was 23 in 2005. It checks out
[0:55:18] thewickedfate: cortisol
[0:55:22] AlanC2024: Cortisol
[0:55:23] sebggg: Korthia

[0:55:53] AlanC2024: @sebggg :D
[0:56:01] Alonarius: Bald, fat, stress-free = 🤘
[0:56:03] Angel_Ink: Its genetics aswell. You should look to your mothers father to see how much hair he had.
[0:56:13] sebnificant: Lose hair buy hair
[0:56:29] Reminii91: that's why asmon bald. he's drama much
[0:56:39] BonsaiBear27: Wishing you a very happy birthday 🎂!
[0:56:40] KaisenSiru: Dig time Pog
[0:56:40] Garysteel1984: Happy Birthday (just noticed the title) 21 again?
[0:56:41] Nulgar: The Dig is up!
[0:56:44] Swaynee07: @TaliesinAndEvitel have u done dig with wm on?
[0:56:46] Nulgar: tneTali
[0:56:55] Angel_Ink: gotta get there
[0:57:06] AlanC2024: My brother works as a supervisor at DPD and has a full mane of hair. He must be the most chill supervisor
[0:57:28] Nulgar: @Swaynee07 that'd probably feel like running a marathon with your legs bound together, uphill, in a storm
[0:57:46] tarnishedvalor: yeah i seem to average 3 tomes but mine's quieter
[0:57:55] Sharxkin: tali using the action button makes the dig super easy
[0:57:58] Swaynee07: @Nulgar nah, usually theres just nobody at all, so you can actually do some of the tasks, instead of just digging holes
[0:58:01] LatroTLI: omg same
[0:58:11] KatziCael: I haven't touched this stuff yet >.>
[0:58:15] runehako: ask eadward for it
[0:58:16] magemaster225: you should jump from digpile to dig pile, if you click and get 2-3% you get credit and can move to the next one
[0:58:19] Nulgar: @Swaynee07 I mean, you'd get trolls that literally work towards NOT progressing the objective and preventing others from progressing the objective, so absolute shit and not actually gameplay
[0:58:23] DiscordianKitty: from eadweard
[0:58:26] mattzomix: talk to eadweard
[0:58:31] Vaephera: The one thing that really seems to make a difference is some times tasks get bugged and complete instantly, so he just hands them out at turbo speed and you get like 3 extra tomes
[0:58:38] Swaynee07: @Nulgar in wm? havent had such an expierence so far
[0:59:25] tarnishedvalor: i thought it was shared
[0:59:26] Vaephera: You get like 3-8 fragments for each one you personally take part in
[0:59:27] magemaster225: you get extra fragments
[0:59:46] Nulgar: in theory, tagging all excavations gives a few more fragments
[0:59:57] Agatharn: i havent done this content yet how do u like the digs?
[1:00:12] mrz_thunduz: mrz_thunduz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Happy birthday you wonderful giant of a man
[1:00:25] mattzomix: looks like a locustswarm when they walk from pile to pile xD
[1:00:36] Tegraine: OG archaeology was so much better
[1:00:38] puntualus: Happy bday Tali! tneTayto tneTayto
[1:00:38] lynscribe: I really like them ;-;
[1:00:50] mrz_thunduz: you better!
[1:00:56] Nulgar: best case would be the main group going from place to place as a whole, but of course you always get other groups forming on the other side of the tent
[1:00:56] dastago: i think i've had two or three jobs ever in any of the digs i've done
[1:01:03] Agatharn: tedious?
[1:01:19] tarnishedvalor: i wish the items spawned better.  I need 5 boneclover to clear and am stuck at 4/5 lol
[1:01:25] DiscordianKitty: I prefer the alone stuff
[1:01:27] Nulgar: I think they're really fun, whether in a large group or with just a few others
[1:01:27] Reminii91: fun for you pers
[1:01:41] Agatharn: i love the fact u can now fly most places
[1:01:42] Swaynee07: if youre too many people, if theres not as many people, you actually do task after task @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:01:45] Nulgar: @Reminii91 all fun is subjective
[1:02:25] runehako: this is a nice Animal Crossing event
[1:02:31] mattzomix: i wonder how much digging is required to dig out the dragon bones.
[1:02:36] foxgibb0n: Had one yesterday with less people and it was quite nice. I got about 8 jobs
[1:02:41] blumberquack: I like the event... I just wish it wasn't so buggy, usually I only end up doing one task because the ones afterward entirely break :p
[1:02:41] KaisenSiru: anniesCozy ketsukComfy
[1:02:46] KaisenSiru: Digs are a vibe
[1:03:21] DiscordianKitty: they're not forced, no player power, if you don't want to do them you don't have to. that helps
[1:03:29] tarnishedvalor: i wish the digs made more sense...they're not intuitive ui/ux wise
[1:03:40] dastago: it gets a bit samey
[1:03:43] holyzeke: let’s see what the forums say about them 🤣
[1:03:48] runehako: Digs are just an Animal Crossing event
[1:03:51] Agatharn: i personally love being able to dragon fly most places now except the ghost lands
[1:03:52] Sharxkin: turn you brain off and hope for dopamine.
[1:04:02] kuuple_boople: kuuple_boople subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Happy birthday Taliesin! Much love to you on your day!

[1:04:19] WochiTV: happy birthday @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:04:28] str4ysheep: the rep is also kind of pointless
[1:04:35] DiscordianKitty: on your birthday!
[1:04:39] Vaephera: They are flagged as an unlock when doing the quests, but there can be a lot on the map now so they are a bit hard to see
[1:04:45] Teth33: I saw Bell say you need like 250k of the currency to buy everything.
[1:04:48] Vaephera: I hit rank 3 today, still not had anything from it
[1:04:49] Abothmann: I just love the music
[1:04:56] yifors: what are the digs for
[1:04:59] tarnishedvalor: been doing a ton of tehse only junior
[1:05:28] Gh0stBadger: got my outland racer title
[1:05:32] dastago: i was really disappointed by the lack of dailieis but that's a personal complaint of df as a whole for me
[1:05:33] Agatharn: seems like it doesnt' respect peoples time
[1:05:39] mattzomix: maybe they unlock new quests on the weekly reset
[1:06:11] LatroTLI: is it better to do it once on every alt for the weekly quest and then send the currency
[1:06:24] Nulgar: @Agatharn that's a dumb term anyway tneEvi
[1:06:30] runehako: i would argue if you play an MMO you dont rescpect your own time bruv
[1:06:32] Teth33: Something that's completely optional shouldn't have to respect people's time imo
[1:06:33] magemaster225: the WQs you unlock too also dont reward fragments when they reset

[1:06:44] diyreality: Good afternoon Sir and Happy birthday
[1:06:47] elbardo_ts: the point is to not have 1% of the playerbase asking for archeology
[1:06:51] tarnishedvalor: i thought was account wide
[1:06:59] JoeTheRedcoat: It's all a conspiracy by blizz to add pointless reps so we accept our new renown overlords.
[1:07:02] Nulgar: yes and no, not account-wide, but only the first completion per account gives 5k fragments
[1:07:05] thunduz: rolled outta bed to hangout
[1:07:08] lynscribe: just did it on a second character, the quest is available but the 5k fragments is only available on one
[1:07:11] Vaephera: I think you can do the weekly on all chars for rep, but the fragments are account wide
[1:07:12] thunduz: Happy birthday my dude
[1:07:18] KatziCael: @elbardo_ts lol
[1:07:26] Nulgar: otherwise just a handful of resources
[1:07:28] KaisenSiru: The 5k is collected only once per account per week
[1:07:38] diyreality: how are we supposed to get 240k fragments for the tmog, thats how many weeks?
[1:07:56] topzi_w: where is the vendor for that fragments
[1:08:21] Nulgar: @topzi_w back where you pick up the weekly
[1:08:21] Yoliision: deceRechner deceRechner deceRechner

[1:09:36] Vaephera: 35 days without sleep, seems doable
[1:09:39] DylanTheBard: That's assuming you do every dig available every day?

[1:11:36] Agatharn: i can't wait till they make thing account wide next expansion
[1:11:47] ChristaStarr: until warbands
[1:11:53] Agatharn: especially with rep and bags
[1:12:00] djalminnha: warbands is must
[1:12:02] alextheblight: here's hoping HSCheers
[1:12:08] GustytailAIE: Superbloom is my jam for gearing up alts
[1:12:09] NightBacon007: playing old alts, will be great
[1:12:26] diyreality: you can gear alts while doing stuff on main, which is mad
[1:12:36] Agatharn: once they combine all rep together that is exciting tbh
[1:12:37] LatroTLI: really looking forward to not worrying about having alts on different servers
[1:12:38] FelPlague: HAOPPY BIRTHDAY YOU SON OF A BITCH! Oh are we talking about the disaapointing azxeroth archives? the fact it does not even have rewards per rep level is... a bit depressing, I see a lot of cool stuff but just not enough pay-off
[1:13:14] JMan31337: any idea when the WoW sub bonus ends for the 6 and 12 month?
[1:13:19] SamuraiWillZ916: are they gonna give me that sweet shaman tank? if not use that blizzard pull you got to make it happen thanks
[1:13:20] NightBacon007: it almost like they need WoW2
[1:13:21] Nulgar: I do hope most relevant currencies like this become account-wide, so you can do these activities on whatever character without juggling them around
[1:13:23] theDirtyon3: rotations are fine just watch a video

[1:14:18] dastago: i remember being annoyed when they made mounts account bound in mists. now i can't imagine anything worse than not having all my mounts lol
[1:14:36] Midgens_: it started really early too. vanilla early
[1:14:52] ChristaStarr: then players got older and got jobs and families tneTali
[1:15:15] NightBacon007: Maybe they could take some game mechanics from Gw2

[1:16:27] Nulgar: It's not cynical to change your mind, but it's cynical to claim you didn't change your mind
[1:16:31] Valestrus: he is also not in the same financial position. if you are poor you are more likely to use the game as a way to get oneself self gratification. when one is rich.. less so.. imo
[1:16:46] S3N71: I'm enjoying SoD far more than I thought I would.  It's amazing how you soon acclimatise to running everywhere once more, having no bad space and less disposable income :)

[1:17:19] goblin_mode_99: the game has also gotten faster, it feels like progression resets every patch instead of being expansion-long progression
[1:17:22] Collected1: TaliesinAndEvitel : An idea came to me in a dream. "Creator Drops" where you can acquire WoW content creators in game characters as followers to run dungeons with.

[1:21:47] helheimr: afflicted

[1:22:13] lewis_dub: lewis_dub subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Happy Birthday Tali! tneMovEEE
[1:22:14] Agatharn: yeah that was just awful with bolstering
[1:22:21] magemaster225: do you think theyre going to drop 10.2.6 news on your birthday
[1:22:23] illusionrapids: Happy birthday! <3
[1:22:25] thunduz: so at this point are you running mythics just for funnsies?
[1:22:29] DylanTheBard: Afflicted is so annoying for healers, especially when DPS don't pick up their dispells
[1:22:31] TownieTV: Sem calls it "Spooky Ghosts" and we're going to get him to record himself saying it so we can add it to Weakauras
[1:22:41] Nulgar: 4 20s? Nice tneTali
[1:22:47] Agatharn: next weeks sanguiine and corporeal
[1:22:50] JoeTheRedcoat: Playing ret during afflicted week is fun because I get to act like a bigshot when I cleanse a spirit
[1:23:13] Agatharn: well congrats on that
[1:23:17] AyemLive: !drop
[1:23:37] lumaday: got any sparks to craft?
[1:24:03] lumaday: Does Vakash drop as Myth from heroic Fyrakk?
[1:24:09] Agatharn: it just takeas awhile
[1:24:12] Agatharn: 486
[1:24:19] Agatharn: its kinda annoying
[1:24:19] geekninja01: NCsoft gave a license to a private server that was running a version of one of they're MMOs they weren't supporting any more called City of Heroes. nothing like that has ever been done before.
[1:24:32] Agatharn: i don't understand why they changed it
[1:24:42] diyreality: do you get anything for 3k?
[1:24:46] thunduz: correct
[1:24:59] Collected1: I'd do anything for rep but I wouldn't do that.
[1:25:11] Agatharn: totally
[1:25:17] djalminnha: transmogs would be nice
[1:25:18] JoeTheRedcoat: Anything past 2.5k is just bragging rights.
[1:25:26] katsumira: Give my elit set for rio 😭!
[1:25:38] thunduz: oh that set is so cool
[1:25:39] JMan31337: what if you had to burn Teldrassil for the 3% exp
[1:25:45] Agatharn: they should definitely do that some people just do m+
[1:25:49] k_c_wolf: the 2500 reward is cool. Some sets the glow is really dull which is a shame
[1:25:59] TownieTV: TownieTV is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel!

[1:26:15] yifors: i did not know that
[1:26:21] fat_european0: Happy birthday Tali
[1:26:22] k_c_wolf: Also, the evoker one is trash and never seen. not even on the log in 😭
[1:26:30] k_c_wolf: Happy Birthday Tali!
[1:26:43] casualviewerxqt: happy birthday tali
[1:27:03] DylanTheBard: Thank you for answering why I've got two versions of shoulders and heads for tiers sets :D
[1:27:14] funviking99: KomodoHype
[1:27:35] thunduz: that is amazing reward
[1:28:14] mattzomix: i wonder if paladins are getting a tyr-set in last titan
[1:28:40] Valestrus: i think that itemisation is INSANE at the moment. almost perfect
[1:28:45] katsumira: PvP people have more rewards not fair
[1:28:51] HolocronCoder: HolocronCoder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! Happy Birthday, Tali!
[1:29:29] Nulgar: it is weird that DF Season 1 Hero (actually named "Deep Cuts From the Vault", for VotI Tier glows) is still available, while DF Season 2 Hero (Aberrus Tier glows) got disabled with Season 3. It should just remain available via killing the respective raid boss on Mythic, which is still quite the feat, slash just a matter of gold/money even at the time it's current content, as you can buy a boost.
[1:29:34] fat_european0: Tindral & Fyrakk mythic definitely felt like Sepulcher bosses
[1:29:44] Valestrus: thats good yh
[1:29:47] yifors: hc raz was a thing tho
[1:29:51] Valestrus: not a negative.. and i raid mythic
[1:30:10] LatroTLI: its annoying cross realm isnt out
[1:30:27] LatroTLI: we use a cross realm community not a guild as we have a small server but we cant start mythic yet
[1:30:49] Nulgar: sorry, by "disabled" I meant that it's not obtainable anymore
[1:30:49] DizzyWhite420: happy birthdaaaay
[1:31:00] alextheblight: the vault mythic ones are still available? neat
[1:31:04] HSAyril: Good morning, Tali
[1:31:05] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Is it weird that I 100% don't think that Tuskarr will ever be an allied race? Mostly due to how limited their bodies are? Short, wide, chubby... Pandaren were like that, just slightly taller and well shaped, and they are already the least played race due to looking awful in 90% of armor sets. Combine that with severe limited customization options, and their huge tusks, and I can't IMAGINE them being any form of priority to be an allied race.
[1:31:51] Nulgar: no, Season 1 one has the 3 criteria as well: kill Mythic end boss, or compete KSH for the season, or reach some PVP rating
[1:31:58] lewis_dub: I think its Keystone Hero for all but the s1 Mythic achievement required for it is still doable so
[1:32:53] shinrazrpg: Man retail is such a different game from classic wow, looks so different and foreign
[1:33:04] thunduz: @TaliesinAndEvitel , I have a player housing theory OR I am repeating a theory you had that I forgot and adopted as my own. I think we have an even better chance at player housing because they have the tech thanks to that survival game. It got sidelined to implement that tech into WoW first and that's why we haven't heard much about it.
[1:33:04] alextheblight: depends on what armor pieces you use
[1:33:04] NMosier85: i think its likely because season 1 was so much less obtained in season than season 2
[1:33:07] madszh: Hello and happy Birthday
[1:33:07] dotonbori: Don't bring that bad tuskarrless vibes in here
[1:33:14] HolyDraenor: Happy birthday mate! :D
[1:33:20] thunduz: Giant Tali
[1:33:21] alextheblight: sing for us SingsMic
[1:33:22] DizzyWhite420: ooh infinite dream that's my old guild lol
[1:33:25] Nulgar: I got downvoted to oblivion at the time for stating the obvious that Deep Cuts from the Vault was not a FoS, and thus is _sounds like_ it would remain obtainable - not the emphasis, people replied as if I had stated this as a fact (and it turned out to be accurate, but that's none of my business *sips tea*)
[1:33:33] zaibtsu: Tuskars are cute
[1:33:36] alextheblight: vrykul/tuskarr allied race ez
[1:33:41] DylanTheBard: I'd love blizz so much if we get playable tuskar at the end of dragon flight, just like a war within prepatch here's tuskar because you made such good tuskar friends
[1:33:41] geekninja01: I love the Pandas
[1:33:46] breninn3: Vrykrul > Tuskarr > Taunka
[1:33:53] thunduz: tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi tneTuskyboi
[1:33:59] zaibtsu: Allied race Tuskar yes
[1:34:01] Nulgar: *thus is = thus it // not the emphases = note the emphasis
[1:34:13] Beyondvalor: happy birthday, Tali!
[1:34:13] HSAyril: I saw something from Wrath saying Tuskaar would die within days if they ever left their cold environment but DF has Tuskaar in tropical zones
[1:34:22] astralumi: @breninn3 i'd love to get Vrykul, but there's literally too tall, they can't fit through doors :(
[1:34:23] CaptWesker: im like that with actual High Elves, fingers crossed for Midnight!
[1:34:32] alextheblight: hybEyes
[1:34:32] TownPortaI: Shadowmourne used attunal magic like in bastion.
[1:34:33] dastago: just realised there's a very good chance we'll get a revamped ulduar in the last titan
[1:34:36] alextheblight: they know~
[1:34:36] Arlaeya: OH new theory!
[1:34:56] DiscordianKitty: We're not going to get playable Tuskarr, we're going to get playable Tusken, a new race that's like Tuskarr if you squint and that will get one expansion's worth of lore before being forgotten forever
[1:35:11] CeasiusPls: What class Tuskarr would you even play?
[1:35:11] TownPortaI: all little bits of shadowlands to make shadowmourne i always thought the items was randommssss
[1:35:18] MeggoArt: MeggoArt is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 27 in the channel!

[1:35:23] MeggoArt: happy birthday !
[1:35:33] HSAyril: So like gnomes, but worse
[1:35:41] avatos_94: the dracthyr version of tusksrr
[1:35:41] ignismadax: lol poor dracthyr
[1:35:42] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel I DEMAND Playable Nerubians... Because we need some spider / scarab bois
[1:35:43] justmarundo: Omg and the tuskenn girls...whoh!
[1:35:46] Nulgar: @HSAyril that was just one NPC talking about what they knew - it also wasn't Tuskarr traveling on their on volition, but being taken as slaves, which would have an effect on their health as well
[1:35:57] the_rendr: Happy Birthday SeemsGood
[1:35:59] MeggoArt: it's okay, Evi did haha
[1:36:32] TenWin: Yes.
[1:36:37] TownPortaI: Ogdrul will be a raidboss. I stand on this.
[1:36:39] DiscordianKitty: i want to play that new nerubian, four armed ladies
[1:36:48] CeasiusPls: The nerubians have a humanoid form now
[1:37:01] ignismadax: if they didnt give us centaurs this xpac i dont see why we would get netubians unforch
[1:37:01] DiscordianKitty: I'd honestly play any faction or class they want if I can play a four arm lady
[1:37:06] theDirtyon3: bruh KEKW
[1:37:17] MeggoArt: have we talked about the riot layoffs yet because i'm big mad about the state of the games industry
[1:37:40] theDirtyon3: @MeggoArt its ever industry just the state of the economy right now
[1:37:44] theDirtyon3: every*
[1:38:10] Agatharn: ever green systems are gonna be the way they get more people that played for years want to continue playing
[1:38:24] DiscordianKitty: i hope that theory means that player housing will be account-wide
[1:38:33] LatroTLI: tbf the package everyone got isnt bad
[1:38:40] theDirtyon3: yep
[1:38:41] EllenorEdition: Imagine having an inn style house for your characters where you could hang medals for each end boss youve killed Kappa
[1:38:48] PidiaP: Riot doesn’t seem to acknowledge the existence of its MMO anymore…
[1:38:53] HSAyril: I just want War Within CE announced to see if it has anything worth it
[1:39:40] Nulgar: oh right, that's today, finally :)
[1:39:49] HSAyril: That hair
[1:39:52] JMan31337: because layoffs would be to hard
[1:40:20] schlakt: so no news about 10.2.6 this week or what do you reckon?
[1:40:49] PidiaP: Ghostcrawler like took their entire MMO team with him when they left. But in their post announcing the layoffs they don’t mention the MMO…
[1:41:03] Nimsh: just started playing elden ring again, darkmoon greatsword is a thing of beauty
[1:41:09] theDirtyon3: every industry is laying people off right now
[1:41:34] theDirtyon3: fair
[1:41:35] grimblymcgoo: @theDirtyon3 not every industry. but sure
[1:41:35] DiscordianKitty: in the middle of record profits
[1:41:48] theDirtyon3: @grimblymcgoo okay cool
[1:41:50] darth_nykal: joined a stream to "shit blood." gonna be a good day
[1:41:58] the_howlermonkey: Happy birthday stud
[1:42:04] ignismadax: in a year almost everyone agrees was an incredible year for games in particular lol
[1:42:15] BadXo: The creators of the profit are getting fired
[1:42:38] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel the unfortunate truth is that most companies have gone from creating a product... to just being a bank / stock / place to invest
[1:42:47] astralumi: @BadXo pretty much.. sadly
[1:42:47] nimphtv: but think of the shareholders!!! (sarcasm)
[1:42:54] DragnosiOfNede: @TaliesinAndEvitel  - 1000% correct.  My company decided to weather the storm without layoffs and while profits will be down, we didn't put people out on the street and we're setup for a solid 2024!
[1:43:01] grimblymcgoo: @theDirtyon3 neat pal
[1:43:03] kittiezZ_: happy birthday Tali!! :)
[1:43:10] PidiaP: Share holder capitalism is inherently unsustainable because you always have to make profit at an ever increasing rate
[1:43:19] kittiezZ_: tneKhadgar tneKhadgar
[1:43:28] theDirtyon3: @grimblymcgoo someone shit in your coffee today bud?
[1:43:39] Honorbean: happy birthday dude!
[1:43:41] ChristaStarr: let’s defeat capitalism for Tali’s bday
[1:43:48] sapphire_rosa_: just dropping in to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY! bearsa9Balloon1 bearsa9Balloon1 bearsa9Balloon1 bearsa9Balloon1 bearsa9Balloon1 earthk3Balloons earthk3Balloons earthk3Balloons earthk3Balloons
[1:43:49] reggarded: @TaliesinAndEvitel I agree with unionizing, but imo it should be done at an industry level rather than just on a company level, or there is hardly anything stopping the company from leaving to a more worker unfriendly country
[1:43:50] astralumi: @ChristaStarr sign me up
[1:44:07] HSAyril: I don't want to think I'm self-deluded into thinking I could run my works company better, because I couldn't. But I work in the home heating industry, we live in a really bad area in the winter, our company reports hundreds of millions of profits every year yet we still have technicians in 2 wheel drive vehicles
[1:44:10] JMan31337: in capitalism you are a owner or a slave
[1:44:10] gabekan: Work, work SMOrc
[1:44:24] mitchievous404: I don't get to catch many of your streams but I do love the capitalism rants I seem to keep catching. Happy Birthday!
[1:44:48] DiscordianKitty: Being a writer whose focus is on games while everyone in gaming and journalism seems to routinely discover they're out of a job is not fun
[1:44:50] S3N71: @sapphire_rosa_ Has the new PC arrived yet?
[1:44:55] MeggoArt: tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal
[1:45:42] grimblymcgoo: @TaliesinAndEvitel I wish people realized that CEOs are supposed to maximize shareholder profit, not run the best company out there
[1:45:54] Reminii91: what system would you replace it with? or just more regulations?
[1:46:08] darth_nykal: because the american work force has been hypnotized into believing the higher the chain of command you are the more skilled you are.
[1:46:13] sveikthewarlock: first time watching stream but i watch your youtube vids, just wanted to say happy bday bro
[1:46:23] SimpleJoeCrypto: yea, buildings wouldn't be standing XD
[1:46:33] dotonbori: Or swimming in it (brighton sends it's regards)
[1:46:37] JMan31337: just make all companies have some kind of profit sharing
[1:46:37] mitchievous404: chlorinated sewage water
[1:46:51] HSAyril: Is it Tali's birthday?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
[1:46:57] Reminii91: i just mean are you saying therés just not enough control on these guys who just invest money?
[1:47:10] PidiaP: Socialism for companies, rugged capitalism for everyone else
[1:47:28] Alonarius: We'll be back on top the world once General Signal finishing building his super-laser
[1:47:35] theonlyReyem: hello, feel old yet?
[1:47:39] Alonarius: Sunak*
[1:47:46] mattzomix: christians who wrote the bible should have named the 10 commandments the 10 regulations. would be much easier today for arguments.
[1:48:13] sveikthewarlock: i dont get the fetishisation of unrestrained capitalism either, i mean regulation is almost always written in blood and a lot of people forget that
[1:48:21] darth_nykal: a happy mix of capitalism and socialism
[1:48:31] TheScuffFather: That sounds just like Socialism lysSus
[1:48:45] rynntiltius: Happy Bday Tali!
[1:48:48] diyreality: it's a nice dream, but unless it's done on global level, capital will just move
[1:48:55] codicier: Someone i know was laid off by a different game company and they commented to me that Riot seems to be treating the people it's letting go better than had happened in their case at least. Small mercies etc
[1:49:06] Verdigree_: Verdigree_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! happy birthday
[1:49:11] floydian43: happy birthday
[1:49:29] theDirtyon3: we had a middle class actually
[1:49:45] ChristaStarr: then the people at the top thought “can’t have that”
[1:49:57] revan4686: hay @taliesinandevitel happy bday mate hope u enjoy your curry later just wanted to say my tans e hoodie cam an it’s boss
[1:50:02] theDirtyon3: the people were getting too strong
[1:50:07] darth_nykal: @theDirtyon3 we still have one
[1:50:12] theDirtyon3: @darth_nykal lmao
[1:50:14] Softex: we live in one
[1:50:21] dotonbori: you sicko
[1:50:27] MissMoxzy: you monster
[1:50:29] TownieTV: whaaaaaat!?
[1:50:34] Team_Spanky: Happy Birthday @TaliesinAndEvitel . So your birthday coincides with Riot Games laying off 11% of their workforce. What Arent you telling us?
[1:50:40] JMan31337: when companies started caring more about the shareholders than the workers
[1:50:40] theDirtyon3: what a novel concept
[1:50:42] ChristaStarr: now now now dont get crazy there
[1:50:42] casualviewerxqt: def an unpopular opinion
[1:50:47] Softex: i dont even think laziness exists...
[1:50:51] TownieTV: treating people like humans?
[1:50:52] sveikthewarlock: our society is only as strong as the weakest of us, whats the issue with making everything better for everyone
[1:50:57] mitchievous404: those kids could work for their food
[1:51:02] ChristaStarr: I don’t think laziness is a thing either
[1:51:31] Alonarius: Laziness does not equate to homelessness, joblessness, poverty etc. because I'm the laziest fucker in the country and I'm doing alright
[1:51:37] r_gamma: there is no laziness, only lack of  motivation
[1:51:41] MxViolet: plenty of billionaires are lazy…
[1:51:46] sveikthewarlock: a big problem with homelessness is rooted in mental illness and mental illness is very swept under the rug tbh
[1:51:47] breninn3: Laziness definitely exists, but that doesn't mean people should starve or be homeless
[1:51:51] Reminii91: have you watched the expanse TV series? it sorta show a version of that situation on Earth
[1:51:57] TownieTV: do child labourers get fed on the job?
[1:52:14] Deatheran: stakeholder capatilisim
[1:52:22] Deatheran: as opposed to shareholder
[1:52:22] bettys_dungeon_adventures: happy birthday!!!
[1:52:27] phecter1: did you see Houston, Texas is prosecuting a church for feeding the homeless - just crazy!
[1:52:44] Reiximus: but if you give everyone a house in spute of beeing lazy, and everyone will be lazy as a result, who will build an sustain the houses?
[1:52:53] CeasiusPls: Man I loved last kingdom
[1:53:05] MissMoxzy: destiny is all
[1:53:05] Garysteel1984: What is their parents spend all the food money on drugs
[1:53:10] mattzomix: that were great times. but even in germany we are falling back into patterns from 1930 to 1945 :(
[1:53:14] theDirtyon3: no we would be able to live our lives actually :)
[1:53:16] grimblymcgoo: @Reiximus Sounds like youre the lazy one who only works becasue of societal pressure
[1:53:18] DiscordianKitty: what's that addon Taliesin uses that makes people's names match their class again?
[1:53:20] Ella_bebe: people want to do things, they just want to do something that interests them.
[1:53:36] theDirtyon3: truth
[1:53:41] TownieTV: there are studies about universal basic income that found that the economy was stronger for it .
[1:53:51] Deatheran: the solution to that is Obviously to make it so people cant buy houses and live in eternal despair obviously... stonks go up
[1:53:51] KatziCael: Living wage for all!
[1:53:53] morphexia: agreed
[1:53:56] SimpleJoeCrypto: Is that a study? I'm curious to read it because I sit on the other side of the fence on this. @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:54:04] Arlaeya: having to buy interview clothes for jobs you don't really want but need to survive... is demoralizing
[1:54:08] diyreality: there is this thing, too poor to find a job
[1:54:29] sveikthewarlock: also you cant get a job without having a bank account
[1:54:31] LatroTLI: I pushed for a new scheme where i work for homeless people to be able to get bank accounts
[1:54:32] Reiximus: interesting. guess my grandmas stories from her travels to communist countries painted a wrong picture to me
[1:54:33] Reminii91: look at that you and asmon sorta agree on this point. He argues (similarly) that AI is gonna take most job so UBI is the eventual answer
[1:54:49] JMan31337: humans are wired to look for something to do so people might do nothing at the start but would soon get bored and find something to do
[1:55:14] Team_Spanky: @TaliesinAndEvitel Poverty is Oppressive. And by keeping people uneducated and in poverty, you keep them oppressed and mailable to influence and control. Hate to say it, but look at Religion.
[1:55:15] grimblymcgoo: @Reiximus communism is not regulated capitalism my guy
[1:55:16] Softex: weird thing in out shitty system is that even by giving them money, which they will then spend, you will help the economy...
[1:55:20] barryfm109: First time on your twitch. Followe you on other sources. Happy Birthday!
[1:55:50] OceaneSarai: AI scares me so much
[1:55:54] breninn3: Go to a library, there are community based solutions to these problems. Laziness shouldn't make you homeless, but the arguement that they can't apply for work is wrong
[1:56:19] brunojmro: Exactly!!
[1:56:23] Softex: "why do we build the wall"
[1:56:35] mechadanzilla: mechadanzilla is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 41 in the channel! 
[1:56:35] mechadanzilla: mechadanzilla gifted a Tier 1 sub to CreativeSerryBerry! 
[1:56:35] mechadanzilla: mechadanzilla gifted a Tier 1 sub to Simmy3DT! 
[1:56:35] mechadanzilla: mechadanzilla gifted a Tier 1 sub to bucephalos! 
[1:56:35] mechadanzilla: mechadanzilla gifted a Tier 1 sub to helheimr! 
[1:56:35] mechadanzilla: mechadanzilla gifted a Tier 1 sub to VytheZ! 
[1:56:36] Reiximus: @grimblymcgoo yeah, maybe i mixed "free houses" and "free everything by the government" up in a really bad way
[1:56:48] helheimr: @mechadanzilla Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:56:49] Deatheran: @grimblymcgoo lets not forget people who leave comunist countries to come live in the a capatalyst one are often of a certain mindset
[1:56:49] JMan31337: we have AI that can mine coal but still have workers getting black lung
[1:56:53] HSAyril: They making McDonald's that is almost entirely run by computers and robots. The only thing the 2 employees do their is make sure the machines are working
[1:56:54] Reminii91: bro that's so pessimistic... it's your birthday man
[1:57:02] sveikthewarlock: what blows my mind is that wacom actually used AI "art" in recent promotional content and their only bloody customers are artists
[1:57:04] mattzomix: how do we pay for things produced by AI when everyone becomes unemployed?^^
[1:57:09] grimblymcgoo: @Reiximus youre a clown. go talk to your grandma more
[1:57:22] rilozeta: I like his solutions too :(
[1:57:25] casualviewerxqt: I completely agree with the identifying the issue lol no one can match him
[1:57:53] mckblitz: Listening to Tali talk about capitalism is the best. Its like hes giving us a gift for his birthday.
[1:57:54] casualviewerxqt: What are the things that u disagree with Karl tho?
[1:58:00] Reiximus: @grimblymcgoo well thank you for making fun of me because i found a flaw in my thinking
[1:58:02] ChristaStarr: birthday stream blues tneWineTime
[1:58:14] ignismadax: successful people typically trend on having lots of strong foots in the door already. All you really need is to be related to somebody with resources and you’re good regardless of work ethic; it makes any meritocracy argument moot haha
[1:58:22] wanik90: bit of anti-capitalism, as a birthday treat.
[1:58:23] JMan31337: I think it is crazy AI is taking the creative jobs and not the manual labor jobs that are hazards to humans
[1:58:49] theDirtyon3: @Reiximus hes been being a douche in chat this morning. some people need to make themeslves feel better.
[1:59:04] wanik90: the threat of homelessness is essential to capitalism.
[1:59:11] ChristaStarr: there are also nearly twice as many people alive now than in the 80s
[1:59:22] ninkakittyh: ninkakittyh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Here's to 43 more months of boredom! :-)
[1:59:23] noirelullaby: HAPPPY BIRTHDAYYY
[1:59:34] breninn3: Population control when?
[1:59:43] DiscordianKitty: @JMan31337 ditto
[1:59:48] Reminii91: sure that makes sense. In other notes, are you playing palworld?
[1:59:55] Team_Spanky: @TaliesinAndEvitel Additionally drugs and addiction and the lack of social services to address them, contribute massively to homelessness
[1:59:57] ChristaStarr: that’s why America doesn’t have universal healthcare imho - threat of losing insurance keeps you in a shit job
[2:00:08] LatroTLI: trying to save for a first house in the UK is actually horrible
[2:00:11] sveikthewarlock: AI needs to be harshly regulated, it generates off of work that people have created and is blatant plagiarism >:(
[2:00:21] Nulgar: @breninn3 in the humane way, by educating people about sex, giving them access to birth control
[2:00:22] mrswellrested: Happy birthday!!
[2:00:24] Eredith: happy birthday! 🎊
[2:00:31] schlakt: Took a break from studying to watch you teach me more stuff, min maxing studying
[2:00:42] funviking99: Tali have u tried anymore of those c
[2:00:43] biglou777: Hi Taliesin, I just want you to know you are a treasure to the WoW community, especially with your enthusiasm and positivity for WoW. Happy Birthday!
[2:01:19] MxViolet: employment rate also doesn’t account for salaries and how a lot of people are 200% employed 🙃
[2:01:24] Deatheran: who knew when you make healthcare a public thing people are not chained to their jobs like slaves
[2:01:38] vlaovich88: Especially with having a family.
[2:01:42] breninn3: @Nulgar That doesn't work though. People in the UK have had access to sex education, and free birth control for years. Yet, people are still popping out 3+ klds each. There's not enough housing and we keep producing more and more people
[2:01:56] ChristaStarr: @deatheran the people who killed it in the Us knew for sure tneTaliCry
[2:02:08] HSAyril: We're not gonna get our officials to agree to work on important stuff like Healthcare when we've got people like an official of Kentucky is worried more about taking 1st cousins off the list of what's considered incest
[2:02:11] critcobain: Happy birthday. This doesn't look like Season of Discovery though
[2:02:12] the_howlermonkey: Healthcare is the way the US keeps its slaves on the corporate plantation
[2:02:56] mattzomix: who would have known that o.O
[2:03:02] blue_cat_gaming: politicians - in the Uk are so self serving
[2:03:08] Team_Spanky: Politicians at this point, At least in the US only care about getting elected and staying in office. The fact that Senators and The Congress can own Stocks is a problem in itself
[2:03:16] KatziCael: Should read up about New Zealand's new Horrific government Tali - they're all realestate slumlords, tories, and liberterian aholes
[2:03:22] sveikthewarlock: that goes the same for AI generated voicing
[2:03:39] john_fury_: john_fury_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! No Birthday Suite?! happy Birthday. May it be a blessed one!
[2:03:53] sveikthewarlock: sveikthewarlock subscribed with Prime. 
[2:03:56] vlaovich88: Outlaw it first and the work out the finer points of regulation.
[2:04:01] Deatheran: @Team_Spanky thats because its an infinite money glitch, if your in congress you get advanced warning on things and can buy or sell stocks ahead for big profit LUL
[2:04:05] KatziCael: massive tax cuts to landlords, funded by gutting social services and killing of antismoking regulations to pay for it
[2:04:10] netonkent: Would that make it so people could react to videos though ?
[2:04:11] DiscordianKitty: hot tub birthday stream
[2:04:18] ChristaStarr: how many subs to get Tali to stream in his bday suit? tneTali
[2:04:20] Thoreya: that chick stepped down
[2:04:20] KatziCael: New one is COOKED
[2:04:26] blue_cat_gaming: I've known my local MP since he was a councillor 20 years ago - back then he had great ideals - now he is just like the rest of them - sad to see
[2:04:29] Nulgar: @KatziCael wait, is Ardern out?
[2:04:32] LatroTLI: house prices are 400% low balling more than the 90s but salarys are only 20% higher
[2:04:44] GoldSmog: @Nulgar she stepoped down
[2:04:48] KatziCael: @Nulgar Yea a while ago, but new government as of November are basically tories and republicans with a funny accent
[2:04:56] Team_Spanky: @Deatheran Also Congress and Senators can vote for their own raises. Nothing performance based. They just get to decide if they get raises. And They always vote yes
[2:05:00] Alonarius: Scottish Parliament are chads mate
[2:05:11] Nulgar: fuck, why? Why is Trump setting such a fucked-up trend?
[2:05:13] vlaovich88: It would make parody tricky... but that is okay with the harm deepfakes can do.
[2:05:14] ignismadax: it might be ok if react videos were a casualty lol
[2:05:38] Softex: i also had politicians i liked^^ now i dont anymore ;D
[2:05:50] KatziCael: @Nulgar National and ACT party had US/UK help/funding on social media campaigns. Thousands of trolls/bots everywhere
[2:06:00] Ob1dragonborn: Hello friends
[2:06:11] KatziCael: Leader of ACT got flown around by an american billionaire in his private plane
[2:06:13] Ob1dragonborn: Also Happy birthday!
[2:06:26] Alonarius: It's almost funnier if it's not-quite-but-basically-that-person
[2:06:31] Deatheran: @Team_Spanky true but i think ther salary is honnestly a miniscule part of the overall scummyness of the whole system. is 500k a year alot when they have many millions in stocks, its still scummy as fuck tho
[2:06:31] HSAyril: Stop it
[2:06:38] ChristaStarr: ugh I hate this timeline
[2:06:40] theDirtyon3: dont make me sad today please
[2:06:46] chronos789: seeming likely, yeah
[2:06:46] Reminii91: jeezuz, it's gonna another wild four years
[2:06:47] DiscordianKitty: another four years of hell
[2:06:49] sveikthewarlock: i thought he wasnt allowed to run anymore
[2:06:50] HSAyril: Not on my vote he won't
[2:06:53] theonlyReyem: theonlyReyem subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! If you happen to spot a guy in goldshire called Xinning, tell him he smells smileW
[2:06:57] mrswellrested: unfortunately
[2:06:59] MeggoArt: it's real doomer hours this morning
[2:07:01] boufaaaa: don’t do this to us :(
[2:07:01] KatziCael: you're prob right tali.... Biden's already ruined his legacy supporting the genocide
[2:07:01] yifors: is that a chocobo mount
[2:07:06] magemaster225: where would skits where you take a picture of the person and cut out the mouth and replace it with your own fall in
[2:07:12] Taff_x: @KatziCael yikes
[2:07:12] Deatheran: fellons are allowed to run in the states
[2:07:12] the_howlermonkey: RIP to our country
[2:07:20] SquiggySquonk: If Trump wins, I wouldn't be surprise if this next election is our last.
[2:07:25] MisterBongwater: and they’ll blame leftists again instead of looking in the mirror
[2:07:25] MeggoArt: RIP
[2:07:39] vlaovich88: Some states ban he from running. Supreme Court will decide on it soonish
[2:07:46] DylanTheBard: But you could get the statue anyway js...
[2:07:46] roguebbr: happy birthday old mate
[2:07:52] sharKashay: happy birthday!
[2:07:59] Quachiri: Late to stream, but happy birthday, Tali
[2:08:01] PidiaP: support for Trump is super low even from his base, the MAGA movement dies this year
[2:08:09] blue_cat_gaming: Is that a wee wanger I see hanging there lol
[2:08:15] illestra: illestra subscribed with Prime. 
[2:08:16] Rico_Azzarash: TALI! MAKE IT until 10th February AND I WILL BANG ALL THAT WILL REMAIN! XDDD
[2:08:27] Softex: @blue_cat_gaming i think it's big
[2:08:28] ChristaStarr: if he gets convicted of insurrection in March it opens the door to more banning him from running
[2:08:35] Team_Spanky: @Deatheran It truly is. There is so much self dealing, and lobbying its embarrassing. And they get free government funded health care even after they leave office. Something that they somehow cannot fathom to give to the people
[2:08:41] Rico_Azzarash: just kidding xD
[2:08:47] Rico_Azzarash: But I wish I can :3
[2:08:57] manlywilliammarsh: was watching your pod the other day and the exact time you were talking about flying through the dark portal during outland cup i was on that point in the course thanks for the assist :P
[2:09:02] grimblymcgoo: @PidiaP Do you live near his support base? I hope you're right but based on my observations it wont die
[2:09:09] ChristaStarr: living during the fall of Rome isn’t nearly as fun as it sounded tneTaliCry
[2:09:17] schlakt: true haha
[2:09:19] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:09:29] Nulgar: ugh, those mouth replacements were never funny, and tbh triggered my uncanny valley HARD, disgusting
[2:09:30] OceaneSarai: lmao
[2:09:37] Garysteel1984: What part of your skin? FBtouchdown
[2:09:38] diyreality: what about filming people in public? did the CCP Karen got it right?
[2:09:43] theDirtyon3: just $3k
[2:09:48] Deatheran: @Team_Spanky wait wait wait wait in the states polliticians get FREE healthcare? how the fuck are most of them fighting against giving it to the rest of the people holy
[2:10:00] KaisenSiru: HUH
[2:10:01] Rico_Azzarash: Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:10:15] theonlyReyem: dont theaten me with a good time
[2:10:22] ChristaStarr: @deatheran yep
[2:10:27] Team_Spanky: Congress and the Senate get healthcare. And the healthcare continues our of office and after they retire
[2:10:42] MxViolet: everyone’s being filmed in public, what do you think surveillance cameras are?
[2:11:08] grimblymcgoo: Yea dark portal is closed on outland side
[2:11:13] CeasiusPls: Filming in public is still very important for us to prove whats happening in the world
[2:11:23] Agatharn: using it for financial profit
[2:11:33] diyreality: @MxViolet there was a video of a guy filming a ccp lady in the uk and putting it on youtube and she was asking him not to film her
[2:11:40] MxViolet: someone in the background of your video aren’t the “content” of the video either though.
[2:11:45] MxViolet: sincerely a filmmaker lol
[2:11:50] Taff_x: @diyreality that is not what happened
[2:12:16] mckblitz: Did I miss Tali talking about the CCP and the piano man?
[2:12:30] Alonarius: Sueing Sainsbury's for using my image in the self-checkout CCTV screen
[2:12:37] mattzomix: that is a good take
[2:12:41] Hippwn: so is the 5,000 fragments from the quest once a week account wide?
[2:12:44] RosieSeren: also not the same thing, but when working with phone company, the police need a warrant/documents to obtain phone data, theu can't just get anyone's stuff
[2:12:54] Nulgar: @Hippwn yes
[2:13:03] RosieSeren: I presume its the same for CTV as well
[2:13:09] CeasiusPls: What happens when they stop using democracy to ask permission to use violence?
[2:13:16] Nulgar: @Hippwn on other characters you just get some resources
[2:13:27] ellor3a: can we see your transmog?
[2:13:28] MxViolet: that’s not really how it applies here in the US.
[2:13:38] HSAyril: I leave my curtains open so people can record me
[2:13:44] MxViolet: as far as being in the background of someone filming
[2:13:46] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel  *in most of the EU, in NA its RIPBOZO
[2:13:57] breninn3: You have the right to request it, they also have the right to reject said request on reasonable grounds
[2:14:18] fuyrae: trump will help bring that in
[2:14:38] lazyraichu: Happy Birthday Taliesin!
[2:14:50] thunduz: it’s one of the better off hands from BFA
[2:14:54] theonlyReyem: too big
[2:14:54] breninn3: Do I detect a hint of a Swansea accent?
[2:14:55] ellor3a: do you think blizzard will implement the excavator hat in this event anytime soon?
[2:14:56] MxViolet: like if you end up on camera at a sports game you can’t sue them for putting you on screen. there’s a reasonable understanding that you may be televised if you attend
[2:15:02] Nulgar: @fuyrae gonna need some context here, bring what in, and is that a good thing?
[2:15:03] thunduz: BFA had some amazing Tmogs
[2:15:12] GoldSmog: What's this I've been reading about ULEZ cameras, is that just cctv?
[2:15:13] HSAyril: Trump campaigns on policy?
[2:15:15] Scathach73: Not a fire hazard at all
[2:15:15] alextheblight: it fits pretty well
[2:15:16] Agatharn: love they finally have back packs
[2:15:22] Agatharn: readily available

[2:16:17] alextheblight: Kappa
[2:16:17] Sorin__: Oh nah, old school kitchen for me
[2:16:18] MisterBongwater: I want a club, but a kitchen club
[2:16:19] Deatheran: Tali looking at getting RGB house LUL

[2:16:47] Aelissia: We can tell
[2:16:49] Alonarius: How much sex are you guys having in that kitchen...
[2:16:54] brennibrennt: Are you mad?? You have to clean all that shit D:
[2:16:54] Aelissia: *looks behind you*
[2:16:55] Honorbean: what about stone and wood? :D
[2:16:56] lazyraichu: As long as it's not french country style I'm fine.
[2:17:04] HSAyril: Haha
[2:17:05] Honorbean: lmao
[2:17:05] aeson_of_raid_sock: you should use led lighting. it’s so much better especially at night
[2:17:06] breninn3: Homely kitchen required, plenty of wood. Thick butcher blocks etc
[2:17:25] Faqballs: Happy Bday ^^
[2:17:33] aeson_of_raid_sock: we have under and in cabinet lighting. it’s amazing
[2:17:34] lazyraichu: Tali is an ENTERTAINER people.
[2:17:37] bettys_dungeon_adventures: yes that room is really nice, but its not a kitchen LUL
[2:17:39] Sorin__: Lovely wooden fixtures in the kitchen. Yes on the brick tho

[2:17:53] JMan31337: not a fan of the matte wall with the gloss door
[2:18:00] sveikthewarlock: look if you dont have a gamer kitchen then are you even a gamer at all
[2:18:24] aeson_of_raid_sock: use that same green on that wall on the cabinets
[2:18:35] JMan31337: but you could have a gloss wall
[2:18:40] justmarundo: Are we talking about player housing?
[2:18:45] aeson_of_raid_sock: matte is hard to clean
[2:18:50] brennibrennt: I have a Matt Damon door
[2:18:54] JKouts13: All white kitchen is cleaners nightmare
[2:18:59] gmac1982: you have two small children, walls are high traffic areas 😂
[2:19:00] bettys_dungeon_adventures: mat and little kids dont mix LUL
[2:19:04] HSAyril: Compromise. Everything white, but with LEDs too
[2:19:05] thunduz: the issue with rgb lightbulbs on an automated system is my family keep turning off the light switch so they don’t work as intended lol
[2:19:20] JMan31337: fair it could be a lighting issue or camera thing also
[2:19:23] morphexia: Our landlord has painted doors and windows with matt paint... its pain aaf and look shit after 5 years of living here
[2:19:27] aeson_of_raid_sock: all white is just boring and out
[2:19:34] Softex: zap your kids
[2:19:35] brennibrennt: Glass panels are a nightmare as well!
[2:19:53] aeson_of_raid_sock: use that green
[2:19:53] thunduz: problem solved!
[2:19:53] sveikthewarlock: anyone know if razer are releasing kitchens soon?
[2:20:08] Musihus: you should look into Ikea hacks from Denmark
[2:20:20] sveikthewarlock: i really wanna buy an rgb kitchen for $400k
[2:20:27] thunduz: Arcade units in every room!
[2:20:42] Musihus: Cheap ish and the modern colors are darker, bottle green is very trendy atm for kitchens
[2:21:00] AlanC2024: I do like led lights. Wierd but I like led streetlights. so much better than older ones
[2:21:07] JMan31337: how much power does the arcade unit use being on all the time
[2:21:10] theonlyReyem: speaking of electricity, is the transport fee double the price of power in the UK aswell?
[2:21:21] DylanTheBard: Dark green kitchen is the best
[2:21:32] thunduz: Phillips Hue is what I use for my office. spendy but the LED’s can cannot to my pc and react to what goes on on screen lol
[2:21:35] avatos_94: you lived in a wear house?
[2:21:44] thunduz: connect*
[2:22:14] avatos_94: sounds pretty dope though
[2:22:23] emeraldhook: Hey @TaliesinAndEvitel ! Finally moved to Utah from California, and trying to set up my new office space in our second bedroom. What was the most difficult part of setting up your streaming space?
[2:22:26] S3N71: Isn't that called a squat? ;-)
[2:22:33] Mckhero: you just grinding the archives mate?
[2:22:46] SlipusSly: Happy Birthday
[2:22:46] JMan31337: kind of like people turning sheds into tiny homes
[2:22:55] Mckhero: solid
[2:23:02] joerg73: joerg73 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Happy Birthday Tali!!!
[2:23:19] theonlyReyem: its almost time to do SUPERBLOOM COGGERS
[2:24:01] theonlyReyem: ok maybe not
[2:24:07] emeraldhook: Our ISP is giving us issues at the moment, but I'm happy with how the room is coming together.
[2:24:15] Agatharn: have a great rest of your stream and have a great Birthday Cheers!
[2:25:07] ravenstarr: Happy Birthday!
[2:25:29] cardrenn: I'm currently building my first house, and I do have a proper brick wall in my future office, but here is more commom to work with that kind of material
[2:25:31] Matrixovershock: Happy Birthday from a random dood on the net!
[2:25:41] thunduz: that sounds so cool! I love a good remodel. it’s good that I’m not handy with a hammer lol
[2:25:42] JMan31337: you can sound proof a room really easy with a extra layer of drywall just make sure the seems don't line up
[2:25:50] HSAyril: Is the Shadow Priest Mindbender playstyle as boring as I thought it'd be? I mailed Spreist in 10.1 but swapped back to Warrior when I saw they moved away from an army of apparitions
[2:26:00] mitchievous404: ultimate wire management
[2:26:03] TheSonicDwarf: yes, sounds clean
[2:26:04] thunduz: sounds really useful
[2:26:22] HSAyril: Soundproof so you can make whoopee in your office, too
[2:26:25] Saiyori: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TALI
[2:26:40] DylanTheBard: Properly sound treating a room is such a ball ache, but so worth it
[2:26:46] Saevash: Ayyyyyyyy Happy Bday guildie <3
[2:26:49] Kujo1A4: Hot tubs absorb sound I think
[2:26:55] honornight13: so you want to remove any echo sounds around you
[2:26:57] molecular6167: It's better to build moveable panels that you can take with you afterwards because of how expensive acoustic foam is.
[2:26:59] JMan31337: wall tunnels are a thing
[2:27:14] Alonarius: Would it be difficult to change those wires for any reason?
[2:27:15] illusionrapids: sound absorption = studio, sound proofing = kidnapper's dungeon
[2:27:21] molecular6167: Absorbing low frequencies means you need really thick panels of acoustic foam.
[2:28:17] thunduz: my brother has a set up like that for his living room.
[2:28:18] Johntriboltah: Sounds like you need the secret lab magnus desk. What you want is super complicated for no real reason lol
[2:28:24] Alonarius: Oh, I see what youean
[2:28:27] Alonarius: Mean*
[2:28:34] Ryall_: happy birthday tali I love your content, all the best man
[2:28:35] catstar88: Happy Birthday! thedeu4HYPE
[2:28:55] chronocryptic: Happy to be birthed day!!!
[2:28:56] REKGameZ: its literally a usb hub
[2:28:57] Johntriboltah: Yea but as an electrician, you would need to run those same cables thru the wall
[2:29:01] thunduz: no if it’s what I’m thinking you’re saying is super nice to have
[2:29:07] JMan31337: the wall tunnels are made for mounting TVs but you could make a custom faceplate easy
[2:29:14] molecular6167: Are you intending to use this for speakers. It's overkill for voice treatment.
[2:29:39] Johntriboltah: Ah, interesting, any plugs on it that need to be extended?
[2:30:06] Oliraptor: Happy Birthday! tneSuperM3
[2:30:17] Johntriboltah: Good man lol
[2:30:22] Saevash: wait a sec Myff is that lantern part of the new backpack or is it an offhand?
[2:30:33] NightBacon007: Forgot to turn off the main powerr lol
[2:30:48] thunduz: @saevash offhand from BFA
[2:31:12] Saevash: @thunduz cheers thunduz! <3
[2:31:16] S3N71: @Saevash Offhamd
[2:31:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you are missing a fun new game call palworld
[2:31:51] Saevash: it looked attached to the backpack
[2:31:58] molecular6167: If intending to use for studio monitors I would recommend actual thick acoustic foam. They are expensive but they work when you have enough in the right locations.
[2:32:42] Fibnkak: Happy BIrthday my fellow Elder
[2:32:43] Alonarius: At what point are you catering for the handful of sound engineers who can hear the minuscule differences
[2:33:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin palworld has enslaving and human traffic you would love it
[2:33:55] HSAyril: Is that because he's European?
[2:33:55] DylanTheBard: As a music nerd I appreciate the attention to vocals :D
[2:34:10] lynscribe: Tali your smile brightens my day. Thank you so much
[2:34:14] sebnificant: Also having nice stuff is just nice and fun
[2:34:15] vimie: He cares to a point, hes going to buy that crazy expensive camera (if he didn't already)
[2:34:33] Fibnkak: compressor and lmiter
[2:34:46] Alonarius: I'm gonna start to come here for Mic talk, I've got Markiplier for lens talk, this is great 😃
[2:35:00] funviking99: you are my favourite streamer Tali,keep up the great content!
[2:35:15] FresheFefe: so the 808 are sounding nice and clean
[2:35:38] skeletonetiquette: Happy Birthday Tali!! Wishing you a glorious day
[2:35:45] Fibnkak: @chjeko nothing sound better then 8 0 8   money manking money money making
[2:36:08] neverbornlucky: Taliesin don't you want to play a game that lets you beat animals and then enslave them to do your work
[2:36:32] fishamus: Happy birthday !
[2:37:19] Fibnkak: No Patch Panel?
[2:38:07] molecular6167: Is it not easier to get a quality wireless lavalier setup. You have so much more flexibility to move around.
[2:38:18] Fibnkak: But lets be honest would be be as popular without the real brains in the group ?
[2:39:05] Destrolisher: did you pick up a lot of audio stuff from your acting days or is it self-taught?
[2:39:22] JMcGhee559: @Fibnkak I appreciate this reference.
[2:39:27] DylanTheBard: Honestly it doesn't even matter how it sounds it's just cool to have an external amp and compressor than going straight into an interface
[2:39:28] girlfrmmars: happy birthday, Tali! had to come by and send good wishes to the least professional streamer in WoW. the OGs remember John. lol
[2:39:38] Alonarius: Can't complain about your mic setup when it was featured in a Tom Nichols video
[2:39:45] S3N71: Stick it on the Throne wishlist ;-)
[2:39:47] Destrolisher: aha
[2:39:55] Valestrus: band?! - explain!
[2:39:59] judgejudyd7: Happy Birthday from Texas! Hope you're having an amazing day!
[2:40:03] dotonbori: Was it a Nightwish cover band?
[2:40:03] IanSabrewolfe: Happy Birthday, Tali!
[2:40:15] Fibnkak: does this band have a name and recodings i can get
[2:40:16] netonkent: TBF alot of sponsors will care about audio quality
[2:40:37] IanSabrewolfe: @dotonbori Oh gods, that would be HILARIOUS!
[2:40:48] jzonna: Happy Birthday Tali. Hope you're having a great day and an even better evening.
[2:40:52] Fibnkak: @netonkent As a master control operator in TV i had bad audio
[2:41:08] Sorin__: What was your role?
[2:41:12] dotonbori: Ska nooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:41:13] theonlyReyem: was it in Adams garage?
[2:41:20] breninn3: I knew I detected a Swansea accent!
[2:41:47] cosmopanda13: completely unbiased
[2:41:52] gachimane_: play it :)
[2:41:55] thunduz: you opened for LTJ and that is pretty legit
[2:42:07] Fibnkak: 3rd wave ska if it's 2001 area
[2:42:47] S3N71: Not on iTunes, just checked
[2:42:48] thunduz: youtubes?
[2:43:04] girlfrmmars: my brother was in a band called Monday. He was a founding member of it but fell down the stairs carrying his giant concert amp and broke his arm at the recording studio. they replaced him for the CD recording sessions cuz they had paid for the studio time.
[2:43:04] vimie: bluray pc  players can read cds, they go for $20~
[2:43:43] Fibnkak: adam went home almost as good as the punk ska band i worked with. it was call Calico Soup
[2:43:46] thunduz: that sounds sub gifting worthy
[2:43:56] Synkronos: Very popular*      *in Swansea LUL
[2:44:10] Fibnkak: nice
[2:44:25] Arlaeya: The Damned?! oh snap!

[2:45:14] thunduz: still have a PS4? PS4 should be able to play it
[2:45:28] Vondem: My uncle is good friends with Chris Demakes from LTJ, grew up with him as kids lol. Great band
[2:45:29] ShadowDragon14855: ShadowDragon14855 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Happy Birthday Tali!
[2:45:36] Fibnkak: the thing i always remember is this young band  when they were around playing around chicago I thought it was a silly name but i guess Fallout boy turned out to be something
[2:45:38] MrJadefox: Aunties are a win!
[2:45:58] girlfrmmars: lucky Auntie magic. gogogogogo.
[2:46:00] thunduz: @Vondem that is legit
[2:46:20] elbardo_ts: it would be vault day if you had an NA character :P
[2:46:24] brennibrennt: brennibrennt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[2:46:34] Vondem: @thunduz For real! Hung out backstage with them after a few shows. Cool dudes
[2:46:39] avatarlord: You can borrow my external dvd drive, only problem is it’s in the states.
[2:46:41] Synkronos: 2k amp and 600 buck compressor, still excited for 15 bucks scratch card wins LUL
[2:46:43] ShadowDragon14855: @elbardo_ts that's what I was thinking
[2:46:50] thunduz: Pretty much saw all of those bands in vegas back in October lol
[2:46:54] magemaster225: attach an aux cord from your cdplayer into your pc as an input and use voice recorder
[2:47:02] HSAyril: Hey, $15 is $15
[2:47:20] Saevash: Saevash subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Saved the sub for today! tneMovEviHeartEyes
[2:47:29] Synkronos: Hey yeah, old stock is _absolutely_ the way to go
[2:47:48] MrJadefox: Yeah, naming your band is pretty tricky. Sorta like naming your WoW characters 😆
[2:47:55] TioTinker: Yo Tali, cheerio for your birthday!
[2:47:55] Honorbean: Neve *** all the way
[2:48:11] Fibnkak: Would my blood valentine but in that naming convention?
[2:48:18] Fibnkak: bloody
[2:48:42] pernvandamme: pernvandamme subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Happy Birthday sir
[2:49:21] brunojmro: I do, it's beautiful!
[2:49:40] girlfrmmars: your audio quality is top tier.
[2:49:53] girlfrmmars: nah, audio quality is important.
[2:50:16] girlfrmmars: our videographer at work says his worst nightmare is sound not working out.
[2:50:30] oger421: happy birthday hope you have a great birthday Taliesin
[2:50:33] girlfrmmars: doesn’t matter how good you look if the sound is crap.
[2:50:37] brennibrennt: Are all these players there for Talis birthday? :O :D
[2:50:39] Fibnkak: I will say this your daughter is gonna love here year as a drummer in her band using dads streaming equipment
[2:50:51] maialinovolante: Good afternoon and happy birthday, Taliii, have a wonderful day!
[2:51:37] girlfrmmars: is there anyway to have like a monitor in your ear? that’s probably very expensive
[2:52:21] girlfrmmars: gotcha.
[2:53:01] girlfrmmars: when I was in school for radio, our professor would come flying into the studio, banging on the door and screaming for two things: dead air or peaking.
[2:53:08] S3N71: Learning quite a bit about the nuances of sound engineering, this is cool :)
[2:53:08] Popicus: Nah, this is really interesting
[2:53:10] daeney69: we care :)
[2:53:12] Arlaeya: I'm a nerd for all that, I almost went into sound engineering, lol
[2:53:16] Ryall_: it's your birthday we're being indulgent
[2:53:28] theonlyReyem: nerdge
[2:53:30] MillyLynn: I find your tech chats interesting 😁
[2:53:35] Honorbean: 3 minutes
[2:54:05] MeggoArt: ehehehe
[2:54:12] MeggoArt: HIGHLIGHT of my life
[2:54:44] Alonarius: I looove cameras, I love how light works, and all the nerd stuff
[2:54:45] Honorbean: aren't there webseminars?
[2:54:49] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[2:55:11] Alonarius: Bought my last phone based on the camera filming functionality
[2:55:18] MeggoArt: he DMed me the darkmoon faire vid when he released it haha but that was pretty much it
[2:55:32] MeggoArt: but i'll bother him next year if he comes back at blizzcon
[2:55:51] BluWulfGaming: BluWulfGaming subscribed with Prime. 
[2:55:57] MeggoArt: VERY briefly
[2:56:00] BluWulfGaming: Happy Birthday! Love you guys!
[2:56:18] MeggoArt: she sat down at our table and i had to pick my jaw off the floor
[2:56:51] JoeTheRedcoat: Working at the bar? Wow times must be rough for her then
[2:57:18] S3N71: As it's a tech stream, sort of, do you have any interest in upgrading to the 4090?  As I recall you had issues initially with the 3090
[2:57:38] MeggoArt: absolutely insane day, absolutely insane blizzcon
[2:58:11] Honorbean: hardwareencoder; now with av1 too
[2:58:18] MuzzaiaH: MuzzaiaH subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Happy Birthday Tali!
[2:58:26] HSAyril: I was going to do a 40-series but it's not a huge jump from 30 series to 40 series. I have a 2060 Super so I'm just upgrading to a 30 series
[2:58:50] thunduz: yeah I was using a 3070 and it was not working for me.
[2:59:27] thunduz: oh hell yeah
[2:59:29] Reminii91: what's the company that you mentioned?
[2:59:35] Honorbean: Have u tried av1 yet? is it worth the upgrade?
[3:00:14] bomayaa: I've got a 4080 in my new pc that you made me buy because I had to get one to play BG3 which is your fault :P
[3:00:23] thunduz: the only downfall with the 40 series is that the are so massive
[3:00:31] CeasiusPls: av1 is a new standard for encoding
[3:00:37] Honorbean: it is an encoder like h.264 or nvenc
[3:00:50] Honorbean: twitch supports it now
[3:00:52] S3N71: I went from a 1080 to a 3080, and 3080 does everything I want it to do, plus I'm approaching retirement and need to tighten the belt ;-)
[3:00:59] Reminii91: ah just heard you said the Company would take a hit, which is weird if it was nvdia
[3:01:09] Honorbean: yes, it is hardware enabled
[3:01:29] Vaephera: av1 is being rolled out slowly by twitch, I don't think it's available for all yet
[3:01:44] theDirtyon3: oof KEKW
[3:02:06] Haaronii: Happy Birthday!! tneWineTime tneWineTime tneWineTime tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[3:02:16] Haaronii: tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto
[3:02:19] Alonarius: I'm doing my taxes right now, I will not have tax chat in here today 😂😂
[3:02:20] sScottyKarate: Go public. I want 1 share
[3:02:25] Lefleksik: 6 jobs, 2 people
[3:02:27] cosmopanda13: how complicated was setting the company up?
[3:02:30] Reminii91: and you just call it, "the Company" or "T&E". Nice
[3:02:33] noketchupjust_sauce: thats what I also did... but instead of 2s its 1 for me
[3:02:59] Otter_Cid: just poppin in to wish you a happy birthday <3 have the bestest of bestest days
[3:03:06] HSAyril: @alonarius I hope you're using freetaxusa. I used it for the first time yesterday and it was quick and fantastic
[3:03:12] thunduz: tneEvi
[3:03:24] HSAyril: Haha
[3:03:25] Reminii91: you have to do all that or it's just roleplaying:?
[3:03:26] puntualus: T&E corp.
[3:03:38] HSAyril: Do you have have a gavel to pass motions?
[3:03:40] vlaovich88: How do I become a shareholder?
[3:03:46] Honorbean: like that mem of obama giving himself a gold medal lmao
[3:04:05] Honorbean: *meme
[3:04:09] Sorin__: I think you have to marry in to it
[3:04:23] thunduz: Can I be a shareholder just to toss in a no? Then you and evi will have a director you can both complain about. bonding experience
[3:04:32] Otter_Cid: I saw the company info online at some point and I have been living in denial ever since, refusing to acknowledge that tali and evi are not your real names
[3:04:38] paden1991: POG its my birthday too
[3:04:49] Reminii91: that's right, we have to marry into the Company to get a share, don't we?
[3:04:50] sScottyKarate: Capitalism was great, late stage capitalism is horrid.
[3:05:28] HSAyril: If you don't have a gavel to pass motions in your 2-person company then what are you even doing?
[3:05:57] CaptWesker: i do like steaks
[3:06:10] Xulu_: Have skin in the game = best motivation
[3:06:14] IanSabrewolfe: Capitalism can be fine IF monopolies/megacorps are prevented and unions are allowed to thrive.
[3:06:17] Freaky_noodle: A High Steaks Poker game! Kappa
[3:06:35] Sorin__: Is that not evi?
[3:06:47] girlfrmmars: I volunteer to be your official work motivator
[3:06:47] thunduz: Evi, Tali wants you to shoot down more ideas
[3:06:52] Osirisson: @MeggoArt  THANK YOU for the Gift Sub!
[3:07:09] cinnatoasto_: Taliesin, as a real life archivist, I am laughing at this event thing, as it has *nothing* to do with actual archiving!
[3:07:51] thunduz: @cinnatoasto_ I am now curious, what's wrong with it?
[3:07:53] Osirisson: Happy Happy Birthday Tali! Hope it's everything you want and more!
[3:08:20] butlerlog: i'm not a communist i just think thatcher and reagan sent the west on a path of ruin that we continue to accelerate down, but people dont understand what the word communism means so they get weird about it
[3:08:29] Alonarius: What would that look like for the internet? Free access with your income tax/NI?
[3:08:49] avatarlord: Are there drops today?
[3:08:56] HSAyril: Does your 2-person company have a "no politics at workplace" policy? How strict is the sexual harassment policy?
[3:09:08] IanSabrewolfe: Sadly, the problems go back to WELL before the '80s.  The FTC allowing all the mergers that created the current megacorps has been a problem since at least the '50s.
[3:09:37] LilStinker: But if we nationally own our utilities, how will the shareholders make money?
[3:10:03] Reminii91: do you think the US is too big and diverse for the sort of system to work?
[3:10:39] theDirtyon3: truth
[3:10:40] Alonarius: Ughh imagine. deal
[3:10:58] Valestrus: and you NEED a smart device as well..
[3:11:17] TaogWoW: we have underground utilities in my neighborhood, US. AT&T ran Fiber lines two years ago. Comcast just dug up our yards again to run their own. Two more companies are also set to run their own lines. So four separate sets of high cost lines for my neighborhood while there are folks 10 miles from here with no high speed Internet outside of StarLink.
[3:12:06] cinnatoasto_: @thunduz Well, we're digging for paper in the ground? Mainly, archiving is preserving "receipts" aka, proof of transactions and processes that has taken place in a business. Digging for paper, that would be soiled and probably torn would be an archivist worst nightmare.
[3:12:14] Osirisson: In the US we dont have nationally owned utilites they are regulated monopolies that have super strict pricing and operation standards.
[3:12:27] TaogWoW: 1 fiber line per house is all you'll need
[3:12:30] Ganryu22: i live in the US as a french guy, and for Americas socialized medicine = you can't choose hospitals or doctors, which is completely crazy and false. You are forced to go in-network to not pay a fortune anyway
[3:12:34] thunduz: @cinnatoasto_ tneEvi  understood
[3:12:34] Alonarius: Rishi's laser..
[3:12:42] Valestrus: governaments are well renowned to be pretty crap at business. take croydon as a case study.
[3:12:50] butlerlog: the absolute worst one to have seperate companies for is trains though, its so absurd in the UK
[3:12:55] bomayaa: lots of people who don't have internet/pcs at home have to use libraries but they are getting closed too now
[3:12:56] Sorin__: Did you see the dragonfire laser? I just want a house man
[3:13:03] TaogWoW: we have one city in my state where the city owns utilities. They have fiber to every home with cheap and great service.
[3:13:12] VinceGadoch: (I'm in the US) People are too optimistic to a fault. Most people believes they could be the next millionaire and don't want uncle Sam to impede that possibility.
[3:13:17] butlerlog: like the UK railway isn't actually anti monopoly, instead they compete to have regional monopoly for a few years its absurd
[3:13:39] Lefleksik: they not only ruin from it, but they DRAIN it, thats the worst
[3:14:05] Alonarius: I did that David Hare play about the trains a few years ago, The Permanent Way... Super interesting verbatim study on the privatisation of the railway in the UK
[3:14:07] Kogan_Urufu: Happy Birthday Tali!! Have a good one!
[3:14:11] geekninja01: @TaliesinAndEvitel I'm not saying your wrong about the internet being a government regulated utility. there just needs to be strong rules but into place so the government isn't restricting our internet like in countries like South Korea
[3:14:19] skeletonetiquette: But Tali! The iPhone! Lol
[3:15:55] markaud23: Utah passed more strict internet adult video laws recently-- this bastion of free-market republicanism.
[3:15:56] teddyg55: teddyg55 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Happy Birthday Old Timer
[3:15:57] atamala: atamala subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! karlach cosplay soon?
[3:16:20] x452beserker: yo merry birthday Tali. i might not be able to sleep but atleast i can come chill
[3:16:43] Lefleksik: oh yes, poisonous rainbow of skittles xd
[3:16:57] HSAyril: The US still needs to mandate one version of our history. Southern states, as far as I know, still teach the civil war wasn't about losing slavery but "states rights"
[3:17:33] elbardo_ts: Cheer100 hey tali, could you do me a favour? could you ask evi if an amazon package arrived today? thanks hazelLove
[3:17:52] TaogWoW: Southerner here, slavery has quite well covered as a main cause of the war
[3:18:01] TaogWoW: *was quite well covered
[3:18:15] Reminii91: do you think we'll get the juicy WarWithin account update like Warband, and stuff soon?
[3:18:18] saintgilliam: ya but here is a fine line when there is to much regulation.
[3:18:20] Arlaeya: Depends on who is doing the regulating and on what level. state regulation of what information can be available (health care or education)
[3:18:21] JMcGhee559: the thing about the protections that government afford us is that if they are working you never see/think about them so it's easy to only see the bad
[3:18:26] HSAyril: Is it? Good. I talked to my southern cousin who said they weren't taught that (NC)
[3:18:52] cinnatoasto_: Happy birthday! How old are you now?
[3:19:08] Arlaeya: I work in reproductive health care... it's a sore point right now. I agree! but... Florida exists
[3:19:23] kiewies: I mean there are entire regions in the US that have shit for drinking water so you're correct.
[3:19:32] FresheFefe: sometimes it's better to drink you own piss
[3:19:33] Lefleksik: regulations are good, many people just confuse it with abuse cuz in current world its easy to observe that happens
[3:20:05] yuvalal: did you read articles about regulation risk?
[3:20:10] saintgilliam: is not maintenance going on in WoW right now well in 5 mins I can play
[3:20:18] FresheFefe: ask bear grylls
[3:20:35] RosieSeren: yeah women aren't products xD
[3:20:39] CeasiusPls: what's the tradeoff between regulation complexity and still providing a healthy environment for small business?
[3:20:42] TaogWoW: read "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair for what unregulated industries were like.
[3:20:51] jurassic_rabbit: jurassic_rabbit subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 52 months! Happy Birthday!!!! Please let Evi know I saw it on Instagram so clearly she was right about putting effort into that platform. :)
[3:20:56] thunduz: tneTali
[3:21:08] TaliesinAndEvitel: tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar
[3:21:17] ravenstarr: You're referring to things that in the US would be covered by regulatory agencies, such as the SEC, FDA, etc.
[3:21:26] pernvandamme: The origin of the FDA shows what businesses and companies were doing before the FDA and what people were eating
[3:21:27] butlerlog: basically regulations that we agree with fade into the background, but ones we don't stand out
[3:21:34] saintgilliam: of course, I do agree with you, but small government is the only way to go.
[3:22:02] MuzzaiaH: if you can't run your business in line with sensible regulations that keep people safe you shouldn't have a business
[3:22:15] Gaming_Mama56: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TALIESIN!!!
[3:22:20] pernvandamme: Yep, no regs for maximum profit
[3:22:43] Thowarr: BREXIT is a nightmare for your entire economy/society
[3:23:12] Teth33: They only believe in one-sided deregulation. Only eliminate the regulations that make things more difficult for them.
[3:23:23] TaogWoW: That's a broad generalization. Republicans don't want unfettered capitalism. They're against government overregulation and overstep that unnecessarily strangle and hold back inustries
[3:23:26] pernvandamme: @Teth33 100%
[3:24:08] pernvandamme: That's not even close to true TaogWoW
[3:24:32] avatarlord: true
[3:24:32] saintgilliam: I am against the government tell me how much ammo I can buyXD
[3:24:46] Arlaeya: 100%
[3:25:05] netonkent: The election in the UK this year will suck , all are bad
[3:25:16] Reminii91: Oof. shots fired
[3:25:27] Xulu_: Ironically, shots fired
[3:25:43] thunduz: exactly!
[3:25:44] Sorin__: Im a firm believer in sleeves tbh
[3:25:53] Alonarius: Everyone and their mum's packin round ere
[3:25:55] avatarlord: In favor of being licensed to have a gun like a car.
[3:25:56] teddyg55: But are you in favor of every citizen having the right to our own personal nukes? /s
[3:26:09] jurassic_rabbit: @Sorin__ sleeves are bullshit. :)
[3:26:36] santerio63: Happy Birthday🎂
[3:26:42] Reminii91: awe, I wouldn't mind my own personal nuke lol
[3:26:55] Nulgar: @teddyg55 but there are personal nukes - they're called fireworks
[3:26:57] Kogan_Urufu: Absolutely, the right to bear arms should go hand in hand with regulations, ESPECIALLY licensing and gun safety. You should need to be able to prove that you not only know how to use a firearm SAFELY.
[3:27:01] MeggoArt: "it would take generations to solve issues in the US" that applies to every issue
[3:27:07] shabobado: did you see Oppenheimer?
[3:27:16] CeasiusPls: I might just disagree with the wording, we don't have a 'right' to drive cause we need to prove competency
[3:27:20] TaogWoW: I want my own personal NUCuar power station in my back yard.
[3:27:23] saintgilliam: Well we need more gun safety being pushed by the government and not gun prohibition being pushed. The government should push gun ownership.
[3:27:29] TjraTV: Right to bear arms in uk = sword and shield
[3:27:30] jabbersthedog: A HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHRAY, TO YOU, TO YOU, A HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, TO YOU!
[3:27:34] diyreality: hmm if everyone has food and house and healthcare, why would they need a gun?
[3:28:09] Atomicpanda: wooo! monday stream! let's tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo
[3:28:27] teddyg55: woah, what is this? a democracy?
[3:28:48] Reminii91: clipped
[3:28:53] Kujo1A4: It should be either or. Either you get to own a gun or you get to vote.
[3:29:01] Nulgar: Americans are lazy people that want to have guns without working for them /s
[3:29:01] LilStinker: Shotgun is all you need for home defense anyway
[3:29:01] Sorin__: Was waiting for the stream to go blank just then
[3:29:11] jabbersthedog: Bear arms? But you don't play guardian druid, do you?
[3:29:14] iamhugemung: wow is cancer
[3:29:21] grimblymcgoo: @LilStinker and honestly the easiest to use
[3:29:21] i_cassius: That incell guy had a shotgun
[3:29:27] Thowarr: @diyreality Because that tyrannical government might want you to be happy/productive! WE CAN'T STAND FOR THAT!
[3:29:30] TaogWoW: The Second Amendment was mainly intended to protect the citizens from the Government, not from each other, if you read surrounding writings and papers from the authors.
[3:29:32] mattzomix: do you have the power in the uk to strip someone of their constitutional rights?
[3:29:36] HSAyril: How long would it take you? I walked into a gun store and bought a shotgun for home defense, 3 hours in total from walking in and walking out. Which was awful, I should have had to wait or take a competency class.
[3:29:53] Reminii91: this whole talk has secretly been about Guardian druid arm all along
[3:29:55] grimblymcgoo: @TaogWoW Good luck against the Military with your single rifle or a whole kit
[3:30:09] iamhugemung: your regionalism is terrible
[3:30:20] Mosquithor: Are you living in the US Tali?
[3:30:24] Saiyori: US passport takes an average of 8-9months to get after you apply for it
[3:30:27] TaogWoW: @grimblymcgoo Afghanistan would like to have a word about that
[3:30:27] Alonarius: Hahahaha that's my favourite argument
[3:30:34] markaud23: @grimblymcgoo Exactly. Unless you've got the backing of a foreign government (like the US did in the revolution), it's not going your way.
[3:30:38] Natas_foetus: Most the people over here who are against abortions are in favor of the death penalty, but call themselves pro life. Makes no sense.
[3:30:44] Thowarr: Good luck against your local police who heavily out arm your local sovereign citizen
[3:30:46] Alonarius: You and your buddies with your ARs against the most funded military in the world?? Lmao
[3:30:50] grimblymcgoo: @TaogWoW lol sure buddy. thats exactly the same thing
[3:31:20] Alonarius: Even in Farcry 5 it only took one guy
[3:31:23] gefuffel: I also love that most people that are for 2nd amendment and don't want any regulation are also for the military... Like you keep using the 2nd to be able to protect against the government but then they also want the military to have all the power..
[3:31:28] Mosquithor: You can have an opinion on it, regardless if you are a citizen or not
[3:31:30] Reminii91: wow POG, you're moving to Austin Texas by chance?
[3:31:35] i_identify_as_a_mistake: And now the image of Tali showing his daughter's first boyfriend his shotgun collection is burned into my mind. Also Happy birthday! Cheer1000
[3:31:39] cardrenn: and farming all that mounts and transmog in a US account?
[3:31:43] theonlyReyem: i just came back from a shower, bet yes, i also think guns are dumb
[3:31:47] jalanji: many here (in the US) think those AK's are perfectly fine and no reason to ban them
[3:31:51] iamhugemung: JUDGE ME NOT
[3:31:52] Kogan_Urufu: Honestly Tali, the US is powerful and influential enough on the world stage that pretty much everyone has a vested interest in US politics, regardless of which country they live in.
[3:31:53] zordon28: Happy Birthday!!!!
[3:31:58] Saiyori: shootings are one of the top 3 causes of death
[3:31:58] butlerlog: yeah a dozen semi automatic rifles is gonna do so much vs a hellfire missile delivered via predator drone
[3:31:59] HSAyril: That and I'm pretty sure 90% of people with firearms don't even know how to really use it. Yeah, they ain't fighting against the military
[3:31:59] CeasiusPls: I personally think we should be more precise with wording, when we have to prove competency to drive, it's not a right but a privilege. Rights in general cannot be taken away (unless you commited a crime etc)
[3:32:01] netonkent: I live next to a gun shop in UK yet I've never heard of any gun crimes obviously it works
[3:32:03] teddyg55: 80s movies like Red Dawn and Rambo have warped American's minds, making us think that we can single-handldly protect ourselves from the government or an invading force. If things get that bad, no amount of guns would save us
[3:32:04] HSAyril: Don't move here lol
[3:32:13] Atomicpanda: as someone in the US, i can't imagine moving to the US if you don't have to.
[3:32:15] HiddenSquid188: Happy Birthday!
[3:32:17] JoeTheRedcoat: Do you have to pay money to the IRS as well as HMRC at the moment?
[3:32:29] avatarlord: lol your reasoning is flawless.
[3:32:32] iamhugemung: youre super
[3:32:33] bomayaa: I used to love the idea of moving to America but now I hate the place and don't even want to holiday there
[3:32:33] yuvalal: Do you think UK and  USA was right to start operation againts  houties ?
[3:32:34] iamhugemung: keen
[3:32:41] iamhugemung: build those walls
[3:32:46] szeeman62: Happy Birthday sir! I’ll be turning 36 one week today
[3:33:02] Hagliegh: !Question:  Follower Dungeons,  can cross-faction groups do Follower Dungeons?
[3:33:08] iamhugemung: THE UK DOESNT EXIST
[3:33:20] Harai_Ulfsark: @Hagliegh no
[3:33:52] Saiyori: in the US you are always one major life event from homelessness
[3:33:53] thunduz: yup, even said in commercials as a giggle
[3:34:05] AlanC2024: agreed. foreign concept in the uk
[3:34:18] Saiyori: I'm 110,000 in debt. I won't pay off until im 52!
[3:34:19] jalanji: Dont move to the US. Thats coming from someone living here. It has turned to shit and sad seeing it becoming what it is over the past 55yrs
[3:34:21] Nulgar: Is the repair so cheap, because college is cheap? /s
[3:34:25] markaud23: Love my kids 529 plan...
[3:34:27] thunduz: tneEvi
[3:34:28] Sorin__: Nah your kid just has to be reeeaaally good at sports
[3:34:28] geekninja01: I wish we didn't understand that
[3:34:30] Hagliegh: @Harai_Ulfsark That's what I thought, I just couldn't find it anywhere to connfirm. Thanks
[3:34:33] iamhugemung: Do you have federal aid for the US
[3:34:33] Atomicpanda: @Saiyori hell, we're one minor life event away from being homeless
[3:34:34] LolitaAldea: or medical bills references
[3:34:35] Reminii91: you don't?
[3:34:44] alextheblight: never given it any thought
[3:34:45] morphexia: yeah 110%
[3:34:47] Mosquithor: Yup
[3:34:50] iamhugemung: Where is our UK aid?
[3:34:56] illusionrapids: I'm looking for a gift for my aunt
[3:34:59] bomayaa: why can't they just go to Uni and never pay it back?
[3:35:03] Shepp22: it’s not even really a thing in the US. we just take on crippling loans
[3:35:05] Saiyori: @Atomicpanda moooood
[3:35:06] invadertanz: And then after paying for college and being in the workforce for 50+ years, you get to look forward to....not even enough money to pay the bills/medical in retirement!
[3:35:15] markaud23: @Shepp22 It is a thing. 529 plans
[3:35:17] i_cassius: So why are the parants so unhappy when the kid says they're not going to college ??
[3:35:18] taelion: Also you don´t have to touch your college fund if you have a major event because most of them are ensured.
[3:35:20] Mosquithor: In my country a year of uni is like 2-3 months pay MAX
[3:35:23] avatos_94: or that people are afraid to call an ambulance cause they have to pay for it
[3:35:27] taelion: insured
[3:35:28] mattzomix: i'm glad in germany we don't have to pay for that
[3:35:29] i_cassius: Chaching
[3:35:33] themadbunny275: the university system in the U.S. is deeply corrupt
[3:35:33] MeggoArt: honestly your kids will have a really sweet deal, getting to visit but not having to live here and deal with the bullshit
[3:35:33] TaogWoW: college should be free for everyone that has the academic qualifications to succeed there. Trade schools should also be free to encourage growth of skilled trades
[3:35:34] iamhugemung: what is the UK's gdp
[3:35:36] butlerlog: gonna be paying my UK student loans for ages too but at least they arent crippling
[3:35:45] iamhugemung: tea?
[3:35:49] morphexia: student loans for lyfe <3 hahaha
[3:35:51] szeeman62: My cousin who is a lawyer in the uk now her family is pretty well off and they were thrilled when she got full scholarships since the cost of college and law school is insane
[3:35:52] HSAyril: Is this what the US gets for leaving you?
[3:35:56] Quachiri: Has to be sometimes confusing since College and University are interchangeable in the US while many outside the US is two different things, from my understanding
[3:35:59] Sorin__: Free tuition in scotland
[3:36:03] Saiyori: Living in the US is living in a constant state of anxiety that your life will irrecoverably change for the worse because of something out of your control.
[3:36:08] cardrenn: here that kinda started to be a commom practice in the last decade or so
[3:36:15] Atomicpanda: you have healthcare in the UK... for now
[3:36:16] taelion: @mattzomix I mean there are Studiengebühren, but they are like 500€ half a year.
[3:36:19] netonkent: I've never been more well off than when I was in college, I got a bursary and a part time job and alot disposable income (UK )
[3:36:40] morphexia: gz! :D
[3:36:42] Ladryn: do you feel there should be some fee or no fee?
[3:36:50] theonlyReyem: all you have to do is live up to their expectations
[3:36:53] LilStinker: You know I've heard of somebody else who got a very small loan
[3:36:53] Softex: @taelion didnt they have to get rid of those
[3:36:58] Alonarius: Would have had to pay the full thing for UK drama school if I got in, but nothing because I got in in Scotland
[3:36:59] Voldreka: Hey @TaliesinAndEvitel , In Canada at least, like the UK is it so much cheaper than the US. But our federal government has create a Registered Education Fund that has match contributions by the Government so the "College" fund does exist here but basically because its encouraged by the Government with Tax free savings and contribution matching.
[3:37:03] thunduz: sure did and was just going to ask
[3:37:11] MC_WhiteNoiz: Happy birthday from Cali!
[3:37:12] Atomicpanda: 12K nice. add a zero to mine. never going pay it all back.
[3:37:19] Nulgar: In Germany, I paid 90€ per semester (half-year) and I got a bus card for my city (which was shitty, in other regions students get their entire federal state) and I got I think 300€/month due to my parents' low income - I did have to pay back half of that, though
[3:37:20] szeeman62: Tali we’re a week apart I’ll be 36 next Tuesday! Enjoy your day!
[3:37:43] iamhugemung: Yyou mean the progression of society
[3:37:51] iamhugemung: yeah that thing
[3:38:03] taelion: @Softex No, they are still a thing. I think that changed for foreigners but I had to pay and U wouldn´t know different from the top of my head
[3:38:12] RosieSeren: I feel bad for a lot of uni students now, not getting what they are paying for because of so many remote or just cancelled lectures/classes
[3:38:25] Dred_Scythe: Fuck the cost of college, it's more the sane ways other non-US countries have of repaying the money back. Payment scaling, max payment term, allow people to live and...oh...not make it a choice of getting a house or a higher education. @TaliesinAndEvitel
[3:38:31] Harai_Ulfsark: i wish driver's license courses were free as well, everything these days demands you know how to drive, even the weirdest jobs
[3:38:33] iamhugemung: Eisenhower said industry would be determinded by the people
[3:38:42] iamhugemung: now people are corporations
[3:38:45] Lacee666: in Hungary you get free education if you work it off in the next X years
[3:38:56] Softex: @taelion NRW only had them for a few years, i dont think hessen ever did
[3:39:07] cinnatoasto_: yeah in Norway out schools are free, but now it is practically a requirement to have a masters to do the most menial of office jobs
[3:39:18] Saiyori: @TaliesinAndEvitel I owe more in interest that has compounded over what I borrowed than your entire student loan total.
[3:39:19] Teth33: One of the big issued in the US is that the price of tuition also increased much faster than inflation. Community college now costs what a traditional 4 year college had cost even just 10 years ago. It's ridiculous.
[3:39:25] smop33: In Denmark you just get it for free basically. You obviously pay tax and stuff
[3:39:27] grillelite: @Lacee666 so then its not free
[3:39:38] taelion: @Softex I mixed them up with Semesterbeiträge, my bad.
[3:39:55] Razgriz5000: Razgriz5000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 41 month streak! Happy birthday!  I just celebrated my 33rd on Sunday
[3:39:58] atamala: @Lacee666 yeah thats a loan
[3:40:05] Reminii91: are you going to keep playing WoW all year till the WW? or you're taking a break yourself?
[3:40:19] Furamire: (insert Prof tali emote)
[3:40:25] Teth33: Education is great. That's why I come to Tali's stream each week to get schooled... I'll see myself out.
[3:40:32] szeeman62: Pennsylvania state police just changed that they don’t require any college credits since they couldn’t get applicants
[3:40:40] iamhugemung: charles is the king
[3:40:42] Matorey: Social sciences is sooo important
[3:40:45] Toastybonez: Happy Birthday you muppet!  Feeling like an old man yet?  Streaming WoW and talking policy.   :D
[3:40:47] Lacee666: @Lacee666 well true, but it's in interest of the government too and yourself, so after that you get a good job you are good in 2-3 years
[3:41:20] TaogWoW: short term cost for long term gain, education is a win
[3:41:27] butlerlog: we have something similar to like vocational degrees in germany, that you get paid to do, and generally have jobs lined up afterwards, but it isn't of the same tier or whatever as a university degree? its a very different system but very good imo
[3:41:34] Nulgar: Investment? That's Socialism! /s
[3:41:35] Toastybonez: Toastybonez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:41:41] invadertanz: Yeah but now you have a group of people saying that the education itself is incorrect and is only worthwhile when taught their way, regardless of precedent
[3:41:41] Toastybonez: -
[3:41:46] Itoast2: oh hey it’s my birthday too 🥳
[3:41:47] iamhugemung: Technically youre a plebian?
[3:41:52] Alarius_: american politicians don't want intelligent populace because then maybe they'd all get voted out
[3:42:10] TaogWoW: @Alarius_ hit the nail on the head here
[3:42:28] butlerlog: i work in radtech in hospitals which would require a university degree followed by another course in the UK and the USA which was just from one of those 3 year paid degrees
[3:42:29] FoxyFears_Jaksirro: vulper1FrogLickR
[3:42:36] iamhugemung: Art is a job.
[3:43:05] theonlyReyem: very true
[3:43:19] Alonarius: And the education system hasn't even adapted to what the current job market is
[3:43:31] Alarius_: it's higher education for (usually) white collar jobs. just to differentiate the two workforces.
[3:43:33] atamala: even schools, m-f 7-4, breaks, designated lunch etc
[3:43:36] Reminii91: uh what's plebian? like Roman peasants?
[3:43:37] butlerlog: sorry that had a prior message
[3:43:48] szeeman62: American government will continue to fail until it gets rid of the political party system of election as well as adopting more socialist policies to empower the populace to succeed and flourish without needs of taking on crippling debt to get a degree
[3:43:49] Zerd_Un: Yeah, and then critical thinking and such becomes uninteresting and goes out the window from the education system
[3:44:13] iamhugemung: trauma or recon
[3:44:53] Alarius_: @szeeman62 that's almost the problem i have with student debt forgiveness. it doesn't really address the root of the issue that caused the rampant debt in the first place.
[3:44:56] FoxyFears_Jaksirro: foxyfe2Sad
[3:44:57] TaogWoW: Washington warned us about the formation of a Partisan system over 200 years ago
[3:45:07] iamhugemung: Past the post, more like carrot shoow

[3:45:26] LilStinker: Electoral college moon2NOO
[3:45:26] Atomicpanda: revere it though
[3:45:32] thunduz: never understood the electoral  college. Had it explained many many many times. Just can't justify it
[3:45:33] Atomicpanda: reverse*
[3:45:34] Thowarr: Lol, wish texas had that type of representation
[3:45:40] butlerlog: i saw tories talk about wanting first past the post gone the other day and died laughing. like i've been wanting it gone for ages but now that they are on the other end suddenly its bad. i hope labour does a long term play and goes along with the idea.
[3:45:40] iamhugemung: Look at the CArrot.
[3:45:40] Torkelnder: happy birthday man :D
[3:45:51] iamhugemung: would you look at it
[3:45:54] mendax55: the math for the electoral college is insane, i've done math before that shows someone can win the presidency with something like 28% of the overall vote if they win certain states
[3:45:59] Furamire: i imagin if you where to make Uni "free" or cheaper wouldnt the quility drop due to funding etc?
[3:46:03] drizzeh33: Happy Birthday
[3:46:05] Toastybonez: Don't appreciate my 5 months, eh?   I see how it is.  PSHAW!

[3:46:20] Atomicpanda: Happy Birthday!
[3:46:34] butlerlog: its not actually free we just want to change where the money comes from
[3:46:34] Raghoulash_: HBD 🥳
[3:46:35] netonkent: I can't believe we had a vote on proportional  in the UK and people voted against it so stupid
[3:46:58] xaxxas_: What do you make of the Gallywix = Dreadlord (Detheroc) theory?
[3:47:03] teddyg55: I mean most professors in the US are adjuncts. They are already basically working for free...
[3:47:05] Toastybonez: Electoral College isn't bound to vote for popular outcomes.  They can vote for whomever they want.
[3:47:16] Furamire: apologies i miss understood.
[3:47:23] Harai_Ulfsark: the bulk of all scientific research is already funded by governments worldwide
[3:47:24] markaud23: @teddyg55 Or doctoral students
[3:47:28] Ladryn: better question would be where the funding would come from, especially if its free more people would go
[3:47:32] Nulgar: Even for the government, university would be a lot cheaper, just cut all the sports programs, education is about education, not training dudes for the NFL
[3:47:37] Furamire: supply and demand
[3:47:38] theonlyReyem: hence privat schools
[3:47:38] Harai_Ulfsark: @Ladryn tax money
[3:47:38] Alarius_: not really "your" money... it's all loans!
[3:47:43] rotten_to_the_kore: Happy birthday Tali!
[3:47:43] cookie920416: is thiis PTR?
[3:47:44] Thowarr: @Toastybonez ooo, the alternate slate system; please, tell us more how that's worked out?
[3:47:51] Atomicpanda: when i dip you dip we dip
[3:48:22] FoxyFears_Jaksirro: Yes, most profitable product is not the best product.
[3:48:24] Nulgar: @cookie920416 no, just EU
[3:48:28] iamhugemung: In California our Community Colleges are funded off of local property taxes. This allowed a ballot to take initiative that secured 500m in federal funds.
[3:48:47] epsilon_el: Good for humanity, bad for politicians
[3:49:03] Atomicpanda: they don't want critical thinking though
[3:49:04] Alarius_: BIG agree! BUT the heads of state have to WANT an educated populace. They usually don't.
[3:49:16] Tavoveidas: Think BIC pens :D
[3:49:30] Alarius_: politics is a career of enrichment.
[3:49:38] docielka: happy bday sexy
[3:50:12] Atomicpanda: horn style: constant
[3:50:48] cookie920416: what zone is this?

[3:51:05] netonkent: Do you have a favourite country for politics?
[3:51:08] erdls: their houses are made from paper tho
[3:51:18] Alarius_: yeah fucking massive ass trucks everywhere! cant fit down an alley but who cares!
[3:51:19] Nulgar: I wouldn't call anything using drywall "regulated"
[3:51:21] Atomicpanda: new houses are butt here tali. they're disposable.
[3:51:29] taelion: @erdls I don´t think he´s serious
[3:51:39] Gaming_Mama56: Don't give up NHS for the US
[3:51:53] dotonbori: UK new builds are fairly good nowadays
[3:52:07] thunduz: sure is
[3:52:17] TheSonicDwarf: more common on the east coast
[3:52:22] Alarius_: my house in chicago is 110
[3:52:30] thunduz: facts
[3:52:41] Alarius_: it does sway in the wind tho
[3:52:52] Atomicpanda: a 100 year old house has already done all it's fucking up.
[3:52:58] Triskelian: HIPPO BIRDIES TO EWE, TALI!!!!!
[3:52:59] iamhugemung: earthquakes
[3:53:10] TheSonicDwarf: wealthy people love buying plantation houses in my area
[3:53:15] Softex: it's probably stood so long because it was built with BONES! what kinda necromancer bs is that
[3:53:17] TaogWoW: most modern built homes in the US aren't gonna see 100 years
[3:53:31] Gaming_Mama56: I'm 💯 sure your house is built better than our 1985 condo
[3:53:57] TaogWoW: I would love to have a 100 year old home, the craftsmanship was better back then
[3:53:57] Reminii91: are you going to keep playing WOW all year till WW?
[3:54:02] Trebled_Mind: if a house is 100 years old, it has to have outlasted a bad earthquake
[3:54:03] Nulgar: Gotta keep construction running
[3:54:08] iamhugemung: is that a giant squid
[3:54:14] JoeTheRedcoat: Huge downgrade on plug sockets if you move to the US
[3:54:17] just_slem: just_slem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! Happy Birthday
[3:54:38] Valshaw: you can almost always find something to do in WoW, there's a ton to do
[3:54:46] Trebled_Mind: all this talk of houses lasting has me daydreaming of player housing
[3:54:50] funviking99: one of the better expansions
[3:54:53] rotten_to_the_kore: rotten_to_the_kore subscribed with Prime. 
[3:55:02] Valshaw: people like Asmongold complain that there's too much to do in WoW lol
[3:55:12] iamhugemung: ive played once to level 7 i think
[3:55:18] avatarlord: Same play to chill
[3:55:36] thunduz: City of Heroes
[3:55:36] Reminii91: was just hoping you would use the down time to finish FFXIV. that was why i followed your stream originally :)
[3:55:41] FoxyFears_Jaksirro: look at all the buttons!
[3:55:50] MrBojangus: Same, now that I can fully fly with my evoker, it's so fun to just fly around and waste time
[3:55:51] Mosquithor: IT IS!
[3:55:53] Egzolinas: Click heroes for press buttons :)
[3:56:01] avatarlord: FFXIV is good to chill too
[3:56:04] Harper_n7: ZUG Zug
[3:56:08] LordKurgen: hello all. Happy birthday dude!
[3:56:18] Gaming_Mama56: I love just running old stuff to see if I get any new transmogs
[3:56:19] Mosquithor: I could jump in circles for hours in wow
[3:56:44] Frosted2319: yea just jumping is fun in wow lol
[3:56:48] Arlaeya: There are days I just...fish while catching up on podcasts for hours
[3:56:57] Torkelnder: FF14 controls feel clunky in comparison to WoW to me
[3:57:03] avatarlord: 14 is sluggish on buttons compared to wow.
[3:57:04] wanik90: Ive been wanting to do a bit of end of wow expac FF14, but im having so much fun in wow still i havnt gotten to
[3:57:06] Frosted2319: everyone even jumps differently
[3:57:11] thunduz: FF14 doesn't really provide to login and do something daily for me. Just finish the main story and return when the next patch goes live
[3:57:21] Alarius_: i've always said this... wow is FIRST and FOREMOST a jumping simulator... everything else comes second.
[3:57:33] Trebled_Mind: random question, how soon do you think we’ll see more added to Gilneas? Midnight or as early as the player housing update?
[3:57:39] Vecna00: Vecna00 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! Happy Fucking Birthday!!!!!
[3:57:45] taelion: I think that´s why BG3 kicked me out of wow for month. Not just idleing and doing nothing but having a mission reminded me how much I love playing games compared to just grinding out BS in WoW for ..., having it?
[3:57:47] pumpkin_moon_: Can't wait for the day we get player houses and I can just jump around in it
[3:57:54] butlerlog: yeah i mean no matter the expansion, i probably spent a third of my playtime jumping in circles in the capital while bantering with people
[3:57:54] Zerd_Un: Actually true
[3:57:57] Mosquithor: I'm playing FF atm :D
[3:58:04] FoxyFears_Jaksirro: Best second monitor game.
[3:58:07] illusionrapids: Or a stream
[3:58:09] thunduz: farming? oh no are they bringing back the pandaria farm?!
[3:58:21] HSAyril: The perfect game the play watching Weekly Reset
[3:58:30] Atomicpanda: i miss my farm
[3:58:32] Trebled_Mind: yeah if I’m not playing wow I still love watching videos about it
[3:58:36] BigTimeLag: BigTimeLag subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[3:58:37] netonkent: My probably with wow is that it's pc so for someone who always has a shit pc, it's a ordeal to get it now. Bring it Xbox please blizzard
[3:58:46] illusionrapids: Literally just pressing buttons while listening to Tali
[3:58:51] Kogan_Urufu: I use WoW to help with my ADHD in regards to my coursework. I can put on a lecture and listen to the lesson, while using WoW levelling to keep my eyes and hands occupied, letting me focus on learning and paying attention to the lesson.
[3:58:55] Harper_n7: Happy birthday :)
[3:59:32] madmerco: Happy Birthday Tali! I was hoping the dig would be in a different location this week. but here I am digging.
[3:59:33] illusionrapids: I can still play wow on my 12 year old laptop
[3:59:38] butlerlog: i had 1-3 FPS in shattrath and tolerated it for the entire expansion
[3:59:40] jhopps12: man running in Stormwind at 8 fps, what a great time
[3:59:52] Ryall_: yeah I played a powerpoint called wow back then with my potato laptop
[3:59:55] Bu_Remie: I remember getting like 15 fps in Dakar an in wrath. I still loved it.
[3:59:57] epsilon_el: My PC is from 2013 and it still runs WoW just fine
[3:59:58] thunduz: tali did this theory just come to me yesterday or did I hear you say it that the survival game dev's figured out how to implement player housing for wow and got put on WoW? That is why we haven't heard a word about the survival game since it's announcement
[4:00:03] Bu_Remie: dalaran*
[4:00:04] bordum: how the heck are this many people online what server is this!? not eve stormrage has this many people on at once
[4:00:07] JMan31337: well store bought PCs are more shit now then they were back then too
[4:00:08] Sockfire: Happy Birthday, Tali!
[4:00:11] Razgriz5000: My friend tried wow back in Wraith.  He struggled with doing quests cause his pc was so shit it didnt render the sparkles on stuff to pick up
[4:00:26] Atomicpanda: you could play WoW on a potato. i played WoW on a potato back in 2004. tneTayto
[4:00:29] Jinellea: you got sharded back tali
[4:00:33] Matorey: I played on a laptop without even integrated graphics for the first couple years.... Ouch
[4:00:33] cinnatoasto_: You could play WoW, but you would lag so hard you couldn't do anything. I tried healing in Wailing Caverns back in BC, and I was so chewed out by my group because I lagged so hard, that I stopped healing entirely :P
[4:00:45] avatarlord: Wish I could move myself to a less populated shard.
[4:00:54] Gaming_Mama56: Exactly.  My wife progression raided at 10 fps on her laptop..not now.if it drops below 50 fps she rages
[4:01:18] Atomicpanda: wildstar housing or don't bother
[4:01:30] thunduz: oh i stepped away earlier when I asked getting kids ready for school. sorry for the double ask
[4:01:47] bordum: i thought blizz did away with server "TYPES"
[4:01:50] zeckzeckzeck: So I did a dig really early this morning and it was so much more fun than when a hundred people are present. I got something like 10 tasks, was great
[4:01:51] bottis96: What is a ADD-ON you could not live without?
[4:01:53] dday_movies: happy birthday, man!
[4:01:54] thunduz: @Atomicpanda This! or very least ESO
[4:01:57] HSAyril: I miss non-shard servers. More accountability, but I understand why
[4:02:08] Atomicpanda: i sharded myself once
[4:02:14] Gaming_Mama56: Usually  nicer people
[4:02:20] zeckzeckzeck: weak auras
[4:02:24] JMan31337: not sure why WoW has not made it to console yet they have controller support built in already
[4:02:33] Nulgar: @gaming_mama56 In BC I once tanked Prince Malchezaar while constantly disconnecting due to my shitty PC at the time clodagHeheheh
[4:02:48] butlerlog: i've been getting into these RP PVP events in SoD and it has been very interesting. they carved ashenvale up like a RISK map and each side attacks/defends a tiles each day
[4:02:52] AlanC2024: I prefer the % of speed on the dragon rider bar
[4:03:08] butlerlog: havent really done any wow RP before despite being a big d&d player my whole life
[4:03:12] Saiyori: ah, that and mogit RIP
[4:03:15] Atomicpanda: my oldest addon that i'd hate to play without: Coordinates
[4:03:20] thunduz: I love soar being dragonriding now. Is there a way to use it for Dragon Races?
[4:03:22] Sockfire: Better Wardrobe was amazing, just very buggy
[4:03:24] MermiacBulge: Hey Tali, spotted you in my shard. Happy Birthday!
[4:03:35] MrBojangus: Yeah i loved better wardrobe, bummer it's not updated anymore
[4:03:39] rynntiltius: I heard "the sex tab" and I was really confused for a moment
[4:03:40] i_identify_as_a_mistake: All i hear is sex tab LUL
[4:03:40] Nulgar: Yeah they discontinued that and said nobody was using it? What the fuck?
[4:03:43] Syllvn: I still use Better Wardrobe? It's fine now, maybe someone picked it up?
[4:03:48] Razgriz5000: Better Wardrobe and Transmog is still being updated
[4:03:59] grimblymcgoo: @TaliesinAndEvitel I see an update Jan 16 for Better Wardrobe. I havent tried it yet!
[4:04:16] Gaming_Mama56: My wife got WF bwl at 8fps
[4:04:19] Ushi_1337: which was the addon that change the color of damage according to the type?
[4:04:20] Madmuffin84: use better wardrobe as well, could not live without it
[4:04:22] Nulgar: @razgriz5000 the addon itself, yes, but the non-official sets are gone
[4:04:26] misterstimpak: Happy Birthday Tali!
[4:04:31] morphexia: it's working overe here

[4:05:10] grimblymcgoo: When you use the Mog vendor tali
[4:05:11] Razgriz5000: maybe you have a different version?
[4:05:18] grimblymcgoo: Is when the extra tab is available
[4:05:21] Nulgar: Guys, Tali was talking about the "sets" taken from Wowhead, that part of the addon was discontinued
[4:05:40] thunduz: OH! Tali I think I found a tattoo artist only to be let down by his wait list time. My cousin just had one done by the artist and had to wait a year!
[4:05:42] grimblymcgoo: ITs on the vendor @Nulgar
[4:05:52] Syllvn: @Nulgar I still have all the extra sets.
[4:05:54] JMan31337: have you ever tried the controller support?
[4:06:06] AlanC2024: they are arnt they?
[4:06:11] Syllvn: I have Items | Sets | Extra | Saved
[4:06:14] tyranade_: @TaliesinAndEvitel  i just installed the addon and I have it all
[4:06:33] Atomicpanda: just downloaded it but if that part isn't part of it then i'm not bothering to install it
[4:06:34] taelion: Your´s not active, can tell, yes
[4:06:51] AlanC2024: same with raiderio
[4:06:53] Razgriz5000: i think you need to look using the Shift+P to see the extra sets
[4:06:59] screamnfetus: it's still working but now i have to open and close the window on the mount 2 times to get it to work properly
[4:07:01] Saiyori: hah *** is slow too
[4:07:08] Razgriz5000: yes
[4:07:08] tyranade_: yes
[4:07:09] morphexia: Yeah I still use BW for mog, but it is often bugged lol
[4:07:23] Triskelian: Don't forget to /rl when you update them all
[4:07:23] Syllvn: Yeah I just logged in to check, works on both wardrobe and when I check the actual transmog window.
[4:07:24] cardrenn: Tali, I found a library addon, not the best BUT it is a library: Lemmo's Bookstore Reborn
[4:07:26] tyranade_: might be worth uninstalling it completely and reinstalling it
[4:07:36] tyranade_: i just installed it for the first time and it works fine for me
[4:07:44] morphexia: maybe some other addon is blocking it?
[4:07:47] AlanC2024: right click addon
[4:07:52] Razgriz5000: Delete at the bottom
[4:07:59] screamnfetus: just reopen the window on the mount without dismounting
[4:08:01] Sockfire: delete settings and reinstall
[4:08:04] tyranade_: delete the variables too when you right click it
[4:08:12] toonwrld_999: delete addon and variables too
[4:08:14] Snabido: Double loading bar Kreygasm
[4:08:46] funviking99: have u done more of those classes skins thing like that paladin last time?
[4:08:52] toonwrld_999: addons updating = autistic panic attack every time
[4:09:04] tyranade_: yeah try that
[4:09:07] tyranade_: it will start it fresh
[4:09:12] JMan31337: @Snabido for the multibox
[4:09:14] morphexia: you click delete
[4:09:17] morphexia: on the bottom
[4:09:20] jhopps12: "delete addon" is the uninstall
[4:09:22] Gaming_Mama56: If it doesn't work again. Make sure it's not disabled
[4:09:44] Razgriz5000: It does not change the transmogifier .  If you look at your appearances it shows the extra sets
[4:09:46] morphexia: I play on a EU server too, and it works here
[4:09:51] screamnfetus: you have to open the window on the mount  twice, it's been that way since the patch for some reason
[4:09:57] Rivaren: have drops started?
[4:10:01] bordum: Tali you have such good vibes, has streaming and content creation always been this natural for you or were you ever timid or nervous when u first started?
[4:10:09] amaya21: happy birthday!!
[4:10:10] toonwrld_999: @Rivaren wondering the same
[4:10:17] morphexia: are you sure that some other addon isn't blocking it?
[4:10:25] magemaster225: theres a new 441 BoA gear vendor for flightstones
[4:10:26] JMcGhee559: sometimes I have to open the mog window, close it, then open it again to get the extras
[4:10:27] Jinellea: better wardrobe used to make me unable to use any keybinds
[4:10:29] Triskelian: @rivaren @toonwrld_999 Tomorrow
[4:10:35] avatarlord: I think drops start today but not till later.
[4:10:41] grimblymcgoo: its grey

[4:11:21] madmerco: is it dependent on another add-on?
[4:11:22] Honorbean: oh he has to reload his interface?
[4:11:22] Triskelian: You need to /rl after you turn it back on
[4:11:24] Alarius_: SHIFT+J
[4:11:31] taelion: That´s weird.
[4:11:32] reverant_dm: it was greyed out
[4:11:41] Alarius_: @Alarius_ no wait SHIFT+P lol
[4:11:42] Crunchroll0630: is there a better wardrobe setting menu?
[4:11:45] tyranade_: is curseforge updating it on the right instance of WoW?

[4:12:21] grimblymcgoo: @Hippwn I think thats more for tracking if you have something or not
[4:12:22] Razgriz5000: you could try disabling the addon, reload, then renable the addon
[4:12:23] toonwrld_999: he told us so
[4:12:28] Alarius_: viewing the appearances collection itself may be different than viewing thru a transmog NPC
[4:12:30] thunduz: tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight
[4:12:32] toonwrld_999: bug finder

[4:13:00] ouchmyothereye: is there a slash command or minimal button to open the settings?
[4:13:02] Sharxkin: Talis mine is working but i am using the Transmog npc

[4:14:25] AlanC2024: not known yet
[4:14:26] Popicus: We have no idea
[4:14:31] taelion: mouseover maybe?
[4:14:39] Alarius_: so yea the NPC is different than the Collection
[4:14:46] Syllvn: I think you can turn the Vendor tabs on in the settings too, I have then on there too.
[4:14:56] pumpkin_moon_: what is the addon?
[4:14:57] Razgriz5000: there are filters next to the search box

[4:15:18] Saiyori: jaina dreadlord confirmed
[4:15:19] Alarius_: @tyranade_ it wasnt caused by addons, he was looking at the wrong window lol
[4:15:21] Rivaren: love to see it
[4:15:33] thunduz: tneTaliCry oh...that's not ingame yet
[4:15:44] Gelo3: Happy birthday, Tali!

[4:16:00] toonwrld_999: i just got this addon bc of this  lol
[4:16:05] tyranade_: the blue one isnt in the game no
[4:16:07] Popicus: You get the set by completing the post Fyrrak quests as a Nelf

[4:16:29] Popicus: Blue one 100% in game
[4:16:30] avatos_94: i want the blue so much more than the white and purple 😭
[4:16:30] Syllvn: I have it on both vendor and transmog wardrobe ! So chatter is incorrect.
[4:16:42] Bu_Remie: it’s from the fyrakk quest. You have to be a night elf when you do it to get it.
[4:16:48] CeasiusPls: TBH that pants would probably work well with that orange dress
[4:16:48] AlanC2024: yes. this one is gotten for night elves after doing amirdrassil raid
[4:16:57] Angel_Ink: The blue heritage set is ingame, i have it so yea its the white one

[4:18:45] jhopps12: that's amazing
[4:18:57] netonkent: Any advice on making a career in the creative industry ? You obviously have something special about you being in a semi professional band been actor and YouTubers/streamer
[4:19:01] elbardo_ts: hi tali, i had to leave stream for a bit so idk if you answer it already but did you get a package? asking for a friend.
[4:19:30] Snabido: The troubleshoot phase
[4:19:53] Razgriz5000: That is the quark that is throwing you off
[4:19:54] JMan31337: first step enable all the ones needed to play the game then extras one by one
[4:19:56] AlanC2024: bug. not doing that here
[4:19:58] Zirconix: quite often i have to open the vendor mount twice for it to work

[4:31:29] morphexia: What's tendies?
[4:31:34] illusionrapids: does a similar thing in UI, might be it
[4:31:37] butlerlog: soulshape journal would make sense
[4:31:38] tyranade_: it might be they both mess with the same interface panel
[4:31:44] Nulgar: The fun thing is, it might be multiple addons causing it
[4:32:05] tyranade_: DUN DUN DUN! bad soulshape journal
[4:32:06] Sockfire: we have a winner
