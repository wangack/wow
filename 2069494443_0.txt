[0:05:58] zannuss: So close
[0:06:27] GreenArrowed: i've been shuffling for the last few days, wish i'd started sooner, oh well
[0:06:45] saga_no: I've been leveling through Shadowlands (Chromie Time) ....aaaand one of the quests is bugged beyond repair. Blah.

[0:09:14] saga_no: Well. I ... don't want to whine.... but.. let's say it wasn't fun discovering new "exciting" symptoms... heh
[0:09:24] fallingupwards: I noticed when I que for shuffles during "prime" play hours there seems to be better players around and you lose less rounds lol
[0:09:32] Ryok: after following your old video of 37 easy wow toys to buy with gold and spending about 70k on way too expensive profession toys i've finally reached 500 total toys and got the murloc glasses yagaH
[0:09:45] mr_1973: good evening hazel by my time XD
[0:10:38] GreenArrowed: i can't figure it out. it's so up and down.
[0:11:00] cashthb: dead game confirmed
[0:11:04] kynlaeh: sometimes i find i lose to healers when we are equally matched skill but it runs a long game and i as a disc priest can‚Äôt compete with a resto shaman with mana
[0:11:07] aerissune: I like her skirt
[0:11:16] GreenArrowed: yaaay
[0:11:20] Kurama__95: Is that the Gothic Witch set? Looks so good! Did you lay waste to your gold savings for it? LUL

[0:13:30] Ujai321: so this is the best possible combination for your night elf? or are you just practicing contentment and try not to optimize every tiniest detail
[0:14:32] anker_jym: The female Gnome crit sound always makes me chuckle. Especially funny on a DK
[0:14:53] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:15:20] cashthb: like scarfs!
[0:15:33] cashthb: or scarves?
[0:17:19] LordDagda: It is.....it is.....it is green!
[0:17:41] goplacidly56: Hazel have you ever played Discipline on Priest?
[0:17:47] LordDagda: St patti's day prep?
[0:17:51] Ujai321: you were talking about the mog on your nelf (or rather, chainging the hair color)
[0:18:29] fallingupwards: What's the WA that audibly says when people use PI or other CDs
[0:19:07] little_c2222: What lvl is your pvp gear?
[0:19:17] goplacidly56: Don't recommend?
[0:19:21] apheelia96: What are you working on right now? iv been away from game for a long time because my new puppy is a handful hazelLove
[0:19:51] goplacidly56: puppy breath!
[0:20:14] WhippWhapp: WhippWhapp watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:20:37] WhippWhapp: o/ Hazel on fleek rockin' the green! <3 PopNemo
[0:21:03] little_c2222: I got a set of the honor gear and tried solo shuffle cuz it was the only thing I could see was rated and not have to have a group. They kicked my butt so bad.
[0:21:17] goplacidly56: lol
[0:21:21] GreenArrowed: poor kira
[0:21:36] anker_jym: She really does not want you to get the vicious mount lol
[0:21:40] LordDagda: She's blind??? Really?
[0:21:48] Ujai321: it's fine, she just blocks your cam as punishment
[0:21:50] GreenArrowed: this is her stream
[0:21:52] DrBlackheart: All cat, no chat
[0:21:57] cashthb: can't talked about the blind part but you certainly can be mad at cute cats that love you
[0:22:34] wolfcloudchaser80: Foreground cat!
[0:23:23] apheelia96: lol cat stealing your spotlight
[0:24:14] Streamlabs: Rugmanimus -> all links are devoured at once.
[0:24:33] wolfcloudchaser80: Foreground Cat time is so funny and endearing
[0:24:38] 7thSaga: tasnPEACH Hazel and chat
[0:25:04] Rugmanimus: Hey Hazel good morning! How much Vers are you running?
[0:26:01] jeffdmk: are you streaming until you have the mount?
[0:26:17] jessetenfour: hi hazel!!
[0:26:40] Ujai321: you either drink your coffee, or live long enough to spill it
[0:27:00] little_c2222: Does it harm the other people's rating if you lose?
[0:27:06] Kurama__95: @Rugmanimus I wouldn't say you "need" it, but PvP gear is 489 ilvl in PvP, so unless you're fully bis PvE, it'll still give you a slight edge
[0:28:46] little_c2222: Kurama is that the conquest gear?
[0:28:50] GreenArrowed: every piece pf pvp gear has vers on it
[0:28:51] Rugmanimus: That's good and high
[0:29:00] Kurama__95: @little_c2222 Yeah
[0:29:05] apheelia96: where does one get your transmog?
[0:29:28] 7thSaga: 7thSaga watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! X10 HYPU!
[0:29:34] Moumpt305: as someone who used to be involved in esports and also a resto druid main....I cannot PVP in this game at all
[0:29:59] Rugmanimus: Yeah I am 486 PVE so I think it would be better than the starter PVP until I climb a bit
[0:30:07] apheelia96: looks like they all go together NICE \
[0:30:13] little_c2222: I want to practice but don't want to bring there rating down cuz I'm just learning
[0:30:18] kynlaeh: i won like 10 shuffles in a row healing when i started and got qued with people T 2k suddenly and i lost all 6 rounds and people send some mean messages
[0:31:06] 7thSaga: @kynlaeh :( that happens
[0:31:12] Ryok: @kynlaeh that's why hazel has whispers blocked unless friends and uses a chat window that literally shows NOTHING when doing shuffle xD
[0:31:17] kynlaeh: now i happily sit at 1750-1830 and never move from there lol
[0:31:39] azumeraa: you can craft pvp gear (or ask in public orders) also it's 463 ilvl as a starter
[0:31:48] kynlaeh: @ryok  i set that up right after lol
[0:32:03] little_c2222: K that's good
[0:32:10] jeffdmk: pvp in a vacuum would be really hard you would need a spacesuit or something
[0:32:21] mindflayerMinis: Chat off is the best
[0:33:02] little_c2222: Hehe
[0:33:49] mindflayerMinis: Everyone's got to start somewhere - People should just be glad that new blood is entering the PvP side of the game.
[0:33:51] Ryok: something i realized too late (because i flamed people myself) is that people don't flame you because they want you to do better, they usually want someone to blame for their own mistakes
[0:33:57] kynlaeh: i was confused why they cared cuz the people who messaged me were the ones that won 4-6 matches including the enemy healer lol
[0:33:58] little_c2222: I learned that the strategy that's used in these is figure out who is the weakest and gang up on them
[0:34:03] Ujai321: wow, i dont want to throw 10k games, that sounds like an awful lot of time investment and source of mental anguish
[0:34:16] kynlaeh: i did get a nice message when one guy said he was new too and felt me lol
[0:34:17] RTSLightning: @Ryok Very true
[0:35:40] Blueofthenightfall: This poor hunter..
[0:35:42] GreenArrowed: pvp gear was best for my shammy so i did way more pvp gear than normal on my shammy in SL
[0:35:47] DrBlackheart: The second I had all the easy PvP mounts was my last PvP game
[0:36:06] Moumpt305: it was for max vault stacks because they had nerfed gearing via dungeons IIRC
[0:36:09] little_c2222: Are people grouped up based on their gear level?
[0:36:19] Kurama__95: Field of Strife (Azerite Essence) and Blood of the Enemy(Also Azerite Essence) were bis PvE and locked behind PvP
[0:36:25] mindflayerMinis: I feel like Mythic + key pushing / PvP can be super gate kept by the super experienced players. (or those who consider themselves experienced)
[0:36:53] Ryok: i remember in SL i flamed a healer in a 20 because they weren't keeping the group alive AND killing all the explosives... too me a week to realize it's a pug we all should've just killed explosives... let alone that people died to avoidable damage
[0:37:01] azrazil720: there are only two ways to make yourself look better: build yourself up, or tear others down ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[0:37:20] kynlaeh: and to mongolia lmao
[0:37:40] kynlaeh: yeah i agree feeling it is normal but messaging feels aggressive and mean
[0:37:50] wolfcloudchaser80: What's up with gaming recently? Why are there so many survival-crafting-fantasy games coming out that are right up my alley?
[0:37:51] Ryok: i mostly stopped flaming but my tank friend is kinda toxic and makes me toxic D: at least most of the time i keep it to our guild chat instead of actually flaming people
[0:38:05] jeffdmk: You i whisper people you pvp with and tell them to watch the stream so they can hear hazel yell at them
[0:38:06] GreenArrowed: oh yea, i had some not fun guild moments when we found out we had some ragy people in keys
[0:38:23] Ryok: i don't think i've ever whispered a random to flame them at least ^^' i whispered guild mates to try and help them get better in raid, but not to flame them D:
[0:38:52] GreenArrowed: oooh static
[0:38:52] mindflayerMinis: oh lawd
[0:38:58] Ryok: oh crunchy mic for a second there D:
[0:38:59] Ujai321: did kira punch the audio cable
[0:39:06] marbared: mic
[0:39:06] anker_jym: Holy feedback, Batman
[0:39:07] LordDagda: STATIC ON THE SOUND FEED
[0:39:10] sence_00: morning hazel, hope your matches are smooth sailing
[0:39:13] Blueofthenightfall: I was like is there a firework going off?
[0:39:16] little_c2222: Kira did something to your sound
[0:39:31] GreenArrowed: kira is rebelling
[0:39:36] Marmoh: ^
[0:39:42] kikisume: I was tabbed out and was so confused what I was hearing lol
[0:40:02] little_c2222: Sounds like the ocean
[0:40:12] sence_00: oh ya I just sat down and thought the static was me
[0:40:43] GreenArrowed: it's blending in with my brown noise
[0:40:53] kynlaeh: as someone who‚Äôs new to comp PVP, why is MMR so much higher than my CR? and if i win at a higher MMR than my CR why do i get like 6 rating lol
[0:40:57] GreenArrowed: no
[0:41:02] Marmoh: Still static
[0:41:04] sence_00: it is not better
[0:41:04] little_c2222: No
[0:41:07] anker_jym: Nope, still hearing static
[0:41:13] marbared: you‚Äôre frying bacon
[0:41:19] sence_00: ahhh peaceful
[0:41:21] Ujai321: ok, but did you know you are muted
[0:41:25] azumeraa: I just got my new headphones today, I've been debugging why does it do this hahahaha T_T
[0:41:27] anker_jym: Quick everyone, spam muted ;)
[0:41:28] little_c2222: Lol
[0:41:32] jeffdmk: This is nice
[0:41:34] sence_00: lol Ujai
[0:41:37] LordDagda: Hey are you muted??
[0:41:41] little_c2222: PopNemo
[0:41:49] mindflayerMinis: Them XLR tips tho
[0:41:52] Perkolate: Hi
[0:41:53] GreenArrowed: good!
[0:41:54] sence_00: yay
[0:41:54] Marmoh: All good <3
[0:41:54] Perkolate: yeah
[0:41:54] mindflayerMinis: Way better
[0:41:55] Moumpt305: better
[0:41:56] LordDagda: yes.
[0:41:57] Ryok: sounds good
[0:41:57] Xannah08: loud n clear
[0:41:58] kikisume: better!
[0:41:59] Rugmanimus: perfect
[0:41:59] anker_jym: Yes better
[0:42:00] cashthb: what? I can't hear ya
[0:42:04] little_c2222: Much better
[0:42:04] marbared: fixed
[0:42:09] jeffdmk: If the test is counting to 3 you pass
[0:42:27] little_c2222: Ooo
[0:42:37] Ujai321: you did look startled when it started. did something happen right before that last round? i thought kira did something maybe
[0:42:51] mindflayerMinis: 2024 Hazel becomes a PvP hound
[0:42:57] zannuss: Yes
[0:42:57] kynlaeh: imma resend this cuz i sent it right as everyone spammed lmao, but as someone who‚Äôs new to comp PVP, why is MMR so much higher than my CR? and if i win at a higher MMR than my CR why do i get like 6 rating lol
[0:42:58] Rugmanimus: keep going
[0:43:08] little_c2222: It's a trap!
[0:43:20] sence_00: presumably the achieve will still be there next season
[0:43:28] sence_00: so youll get it ONE DAY
[0:43:30] zannuss: After you get the mount if you keep going it gives you an item you can use to buy any of the past season mounts
[0:43:48] Kurama__95: You'd need to be like Pikaboo LUL
[0:43:58] jeffdmk: what is the best way to put on eye shadow the people must know
[0:44:00] sence_00: ooohh
[0:44:33] Ujai321: i like the 5th Element way of apllying eye shadow
[0:44:48] GreenArrowed: blend gud
[0:44:59] Kunozah: if you don't have primer use concealer
[0:45:24] Ujai321: also ma'am, you are already home
[0:45:36] bustykrabb: New Stream challenge: Mythic Fyraak while attempting Trixie makeup
[0:45:43] 7thSaga: the 5th Element is Love kappa
[0:45:57] Ujai321: in the 5th Element, they have a high tech pair of glasses, that you put on and they just BLAST the make up in your face
[0:46:19] bustykrabb: Season 7 jumpscare era Trixie makeup
[0:47:42] cashthb: who cares about eye liner anyway? it can't be seen trough your apple vision pro, and if you don't have one people will be more concerned about you being poor
[0:47:50] LordDagda: What IS that dqueaky noise?
[0:49:46] LordDagda: ty!
[0:49:49] cashthb: maybe I should play evoker!
[0:50:03] GreenArrowed: i've finally reached the age where i really don't care
[0:50:07] GreenArrowed: about like, the newest gadgets
[0:50:19] cashthb: it's screen on your face instead of your hands
[0:50:21] jeffdmk: it empties your bank account and makes apple money is my understanding
[0:50:25] mindflayerMinis: If you could add one class to the game what would it be?
[0:51:13] little_c2222: Green you'll eventually get to where you don't like them and start getting mad cuz you don't know how to use them. Lol
[0:51:14] kynlaeh: i‚Äôm with hazel in there should be a blood mage/more blood vampiric caster imo
[0:51:25] kynlaeh: preferably with a healer spec
[0:52:04] Silverwards: @mindflayerMinis Tinker! More guns and scuffed Dwarf/Goblin/Gnome gadgets
[0:52:06] mindflayerMinis: Yea the Vampire race would be cool to see added as well,
[0:52:33] Zuldak: i miss being excited for the newest computers coming out
[0:52:45] Zuldak: like i remember pentium 2 and 3 being big deals
[0:52:49] 7thSaga: tagnSCORPION1 tagnSCORPION2
[0:52:50] Zuldak: or the newest video card
[0:52:59] jeffdmk: you want a blood mage when you already dont like mages, and have said they are too much like warlocks?
[0:53:32] GreenArrowed: @little_c2222 sort of already there, which isn't great, bc my job requires me to be good at using most personal computing/communicaiton platforms
[0:53:33] Swordman117: @Zuldak Remember when every new computer part had to be measured against Crysis 3?
[0:54:08] saw141: Hope you have a wonderful day and stream.
[0:54:16] Zuldak: the same thing happened to phones. Like there was a time when new features on phones were like woah. Now it's like... oh a galaxy 23. Its a galaxy 22 but one number bigger
[0:54:40] cashthb: what about pooping? i'd pay a lot  of money for a computer that poops instead of me!
[0:54:41] Ujai321: but it could render in like a third of the time
[0:54:41] Zuldak: and yeah i rmemeber the crysis test thing
[0:54:59] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:55:24] anker_jym: Are there any tanks in Solo Shuffle? Seems like you're only going up against DPS and other Healers.
[0:55:25] CorsairCarl: I dunno how I feel about Priests essentially getting Roll The Bones.
[0:55:25] mindflayerMinis: + the cycle of " This year the screen is 2" bigger!!!" and then next year is " We made it more compact its now 1.5" smaller and more ergonomic" WutFace
[0:55:30] cashthb: fact, it's like moaming in tennis
[0:55:31] Kunozah: accurate, yelling makes me DPS more
[0:55:37] KittyKatWar: hi hazel!!!!
[0:55:46] itsparvati: green hair today! you look like my druid
[0:55:56] CorsairCarl: @Kunozah A hella good TMOG makes me DPS better
[0:56:00] Zuldak: rendering your videos in 3d so you can experience the videos in full VR
[0:56:21] Kunozah: @CorsairCarl also accurate, had to set that up before my arens xD
[0:56:29] anker_jym: @corsaircarl This is based in science
[0:56:33] Kunozah: arenas*
[0:56:45] cashthb: maybe in a few years it will generalte your final boss guides instead of you not making them
[0:56:50] CorsairCarl: Mine is has been cultivated for both RP and raiding, its it optimized perfectly!
[0:57:14] Kunozah: @CorsairCarl perfection
[0:57:34] Zuldak: i just remember going to frys electronics and being amazed at just all the stuff. you dont get that when browsing amazon
[0:57:48] CorsairCarl: Can't get sweet TMOG if I don't raid ;D
[0:57:55] mindflayerMinis: I think URE5 will be the next jump in hardware. Even with it being more streamlined data. And I for one am waiting to hand out some cash money for a good game thats URE5 pretty
[0:58:31] CorsairCarl: I miss Fry's
[0:58:38] Zuldak: Zuldak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Oh hey a thingy
[0:58:38] Streamlabs: zuldak just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:58:39] mindflayerMinis: Unreal Engine 5
[0:59:14] Zuldak: hey Hazel question: as a healer should you use the cyclone banish thing for druids in pvp or no?
[0:59:33] CorsairCarl: I figured it out! The 10.2.6 patch will have us 'pirate' an idea from another game and we get player housing! XD
[0:59:40] blueboywiz: funny you should say that about the dagger. the offhand is literally a corkscrew
[0:59:44] azumeraa: that's just can i mog it bug
[1:00:02] geohosic: How much % now?
[1:00:23] azumeraa: it saves the learnt/not learnt corner icon from the previous "window" if that makes sense
[1:00:38] jeffdmk: why do people ask someone that is 1800 for pvp advice?
[1:00:39] mindflayerMinis: Does anyone miss the old PvP marks for buying gear sets?
[1:01:01] blueboywiz: bc this season is superdeflated
[1:01:14] CorsairCarl: I used to be addicted to collecting Tabards for TMOG, but now it's the colored cloaks from the Trader's Post.
[1:01:18] mindflayerMinis: when you needed like 10 AV marks, 10 WSG marks
[1:01:23] Zuldak: @jeffdmk because if i drag myself into arenas i am 1100 rating if that
[1:01:31] saga_no: Because high rated Glad chads don't give advice - they just tell you to "git gud" and don't actually offer anything constructive.
[1:01:34] GreenArrowed: i miss bfa gearing
[1:02:06] KingfisherGames: The Plainswalker Bearer finally dropped for me!
[1:02:07] CorsairCarl: I'm an Enhancement Shaman, our strategy for PVP is DPSing the floor LOL
[1:02:09] cashthb: @saga_no honestly that's the best advice one can give
[1:02:25] cashthb: you have to practive pvp, theory does like nothing
[1:02:46] saga_no: @cashthb Not really? Good advice would be something like "pick one thing you're not the best at - work on that - ...then pick a second thing - work on that... and so on" ... not just a genereral "git gud scrub" and nothing more
[1:03:18] CorsairCarl: Hey, they use handwarmers in Japan nearly all the time!
[1:04:25] cashthb: you can join the strep throat gang!
[1:04:38] Zuldak: ive been at the beach since friday... going back over this afternoon. Always sad to leave the coast
[1:05:03] Zuldak: kitty is on the other team!
[1:05:05] Ujai321: "this terrible gadget i made up seems like a terrible gadget"
[1:05:34] sence_00: @Ujai321 those usb gloves are real tho
[1:05:45] Zuldak: hoo hoo? Confirmed moonkin phase incoming
[1:07:24] Hellm0uth: Hello Hazel, I have recently started Dragonflgiht again and was wondering, is it too late to get tailoring and enchanting leveled now?
[1:07:43] GreenArrowed: sometimes i can't tell if i'm having a healer issue or if i'm just being BAD in these shuffles.
[1:07:47] saga_no: I think the plush toast gloves are meant to just be charged with the USB cable and then used "wireless" as it were
[1:07:54] itsparvati: its a gold sink, not a gold maker
[1:08:19] Zuldak: herbing is probably yoru best bet for gold making in season 4
[1:08:27] itsparvati: alchemy is still making me some gold
[1:08:32] GreenArrowed: i'm getting absolutely trained inthis shuffle, after going 6 and 6 in the last, that always feels so crazy
[1:08:36] Zuldak: there is always a spike in gathering prices to start a season
[1:08:42] Hellm0uth: okay thanks for the info. I'll stick to mining and herbalism on my alt
[1:08:54] Zuldak: @itsparvati yeah but you have to level alch and have the skill knowledge ya know?
[1:09:18] itsparvati: @Zuldak not huge amounts, i also recent returned to game and level alchemy in about a day
[1:09:21] Kunozah: he tried so hard
[1:09:34] Marmoh: LOL
[1:10:03] GreenArrowed: the envoker wall thingie is killing me
[1:10:08] saga_no: Seems like the go-to strat for this shuffle game is to pile on the Prevoker
[1:11:30] saga_no: Djises that Prevoker is squishy O.o
[1:11:54] Zuldak: the sleep on alert reminds me of 'head on, apply directly to the forehead'
[1:11:55] saga_no: DK-level health-yo-yo
[1:12:26] Swordman117: Oh no the head on lol too much of an ear worm
[1:12:30] Zuldak: yeah but prevokers are so short range
[1:12:38] saga_no: All 3 wins so far have been by nuking the Prevoker, though
[1:13:12] saga_no: They might not be geared - but they seem *hella* squishy compared to the rest of the teams
[1:13:18] Zuldak: i lilke to think a team picks on a person and then gets bored and tries someone else
[1:14:02] nyrhalahotep: nyrhalahotep watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! WOOOOT!!! üòÑüòÑüòÑüëèüëèüëè
[1:14:19] saga_no: (Also, I'm probably biased here because I feel super squishy whenever I play my Evoker)
[1:14:31] Marmoh: The "BAM" is stuck in my head now
[1:15:39] Marmoh: nt nt
[1:15:51] Ryok: anyone by chance know if the ascended council is a daily or a weekly loot lockout? ^^
[1:16:01] mage_belldan: mage_belldan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Much love and Happiness to Kira, Moose, and you!!!
[1:16:01] Streamlabs: mage_belldan just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:16:35] azumeraa: @Ryok is that the bastion bell ringing band?
[1:16:54] Ryok: @azumeraa ye, still need that mount
[1:17:09] Zuldak: woot i got the 16k gold cache from the emerald dream wardens
[1:17:37] azumeraa: @Ryok once a day!
[1:17:51] Zuldak: does  it make up for not getting the love rocket? Not in the slightest, im still saltier than the great salt lake over that
[1:17:51] evosce: hair color seems appropriate for todays spec hazelWave
[1:18:00] Ryok: @azumeraa thanks yagaL
[1:18:39] Ryok: damn DH not running mortal dance for that 50% less healing debuff D:
[1:19:45] saga_no: Is "trained" when everyone gangs up on you?
[1:19:55] Ryok: ah nvm he is running it ^^
[1:20:19] Marmoh: I've accepted that my mental would be best if I don't chase after the love rocket and the MoP world bosses :p
[1:21:05] jongorski: damn they didnt let up on you once
[1:21:18] Zuldak: the mop world bosses are just 1% drops now
[1:21:23] Zuldak: like you should do em
[1:22:02] cashthb: time for an epic bg? :O
[1:22:20] Zuldak: my problem with the rocket is its only able to BE farmed once a year
[1:22:37] Zuldak: im cool with farming it out, its just limiting the window
[1:22:42] saga_no: If my luck was any indicator, I should be getting every single mount in the game 1st or 3rd try
[1:23:01] Ryok: so apparently my guildie was in a normal raid pug that had 5 legendaries drop xD they really must've buffed that bad luck protection
[1:23:04] Hellm0uth: I'm convinced the mount in Stratholme doesn't drop after 197 attempts
[1:23:22] anker_jym: Just hopped back in, what percentage are we at?
[1:23:32] itsparvati: maybe i need those hand warmers, it been cold in here today
[1:23:36] Zuldak: Some transmogs are pretty AWFUL to farm out. The legion violet hold herioc has unique mog tints and the bosses are random every day
[1:23:37] Swordman117: Sharkbait oh ha ha
[1:23:42] Zuldak: with a daily lockou
[1:24:00] azumeraa: what is that addon what shows you all that cool stuff about mounts?
[1:24:00] cashthb: sharkbait could randomly drop for peeps who don't care for mounts tho
[1:24:02] anker_jym: Nice, good job!!
[1:24:12] Hellm0uth: I'll keep trying though!
[1:24:12] azumeraa: Thank you!
[1:24:12] saga_no: Mount Journal Enhanced
[1:24:19] saga_no: I think there's a Pet Journal Enhanced too
[1:24:27] saga_no: But i'm not 100% sure
[1:24:44] wafflecone95: ouuuuu i like your hair
[1:24:47] itsparvati: rematch is tons better
[1:24:48] saga_no: I think I'm running both
[1:24:53] wafflecone95: green is bis
[1:24:57] saga_no: So I'm not entirely sure which addon shows what anymore
[1:25:12] cashthb: I don't run either!
[1:25:13] itsparvati: i would say rematch and pet scripts are pet battler must haves
[1:25:37] anker_jym: Also, with mount drops, there have been a few times where I've had rare mount drop in batches of two. Meaning I got one mount from a raid, then went to go run another raid, and got a 2nd rare mount. I won't say which mounts so I don't upset people lol
[1:25:50] saga_no: I grabbed every pet battle / journal addon I could find for my WoW Pok√©mon trainer toon
[1:26:07] mindflayerMinis: Hazel what are you holding?
[1:26:16] azumeraa: pet battle enhanced is still abandoned, but a toy one exist
[1:26:24] itsparvati: what nerds do that... ok i may have done that before i had good stable of pets
[1:26:31] Kurama__95: I used to spend 1-2 hours in some fights coming up with teams and strats in SL for achievments and it was fun, but for stuff like WQs and Squirt, Rematch + Script is just a superior experience
[1:26:39] Zuldak: you could just hold recharging battery packs, those get toasty
[1:26:40] mindflayerMinis: Pro SC2 player move :P
[1:26:46] saga_no: I like the challenge of figuring out if I can win a pet battle on my own ;P
[1:26:46] Kunozah: I am useless in Blitz dang
[1:26:51] wolfcloudchaser80: She's holding controllers for her SmartWig.
[1:26:53] Zuldak: and you would have charged backup batteries for your phone :P
[1:27:04] GreenArrowed: looool
[1:27:12] Mejafo: hey Hazel nice hair
[1:27:17] mindflayerMinis: @wolfcloudchaser80 Legit would actually be super cool
[1:27:18] Cyberwolffe: Cyberwolffe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months, currently on a 53 month streak! Hi everyone
[1:27:18] Streamlabs: cyberwolffe just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:27:24] Zuldak: a weenus is the excess or loose skin at the joint of one's elbow
[1:27:27] Kurama__95: Yeah, his title is from Mythic Fyrakk too
[1:27:33] cashthb: just get a mythic fyrak kill, where's the issue?
[1:27:51] anker_jym: Wait, they discovered how to get the flame owl? I thought the secret Discord hadn't figured it out yetm
[1:27:54] wolfcloudchaser80: @mindflayerMinis I immediately had the same thought. Imagine fiber-optics or hidden rgb lights?
[1:28:01] itsparvati: my phone may need recharging if i ever left the house
[1:28:10] Zuldak: @anker_jym its the mythic mount off fyrrak
[1:28:23] Kurama__95: @anker_jym It's been figured out for a while. You need to kill Mythic Fyrakk on a hunter to get an item that allows you to tame it
[1:28:25] 7thSaga: Hazel i was quite bummed yesterday i coulda swore iw as gona get the leggo on my War but nope and i seen 3 drop :( Whens my time!?!?!
[1:28:30] Ryok: @anker_jym the mount? we knew before the patch went live that it's mythic fyrakk
[1:28:38] supashanka: dead monk?  any relations to deadmaus?
[1:28:41] anker_jym: Oh, I gotcham
[1:28:46] itsparvati: you get the druid form with the mount even if not druid
[1:28:59] anker_jym: @ryok Right, I knew about the mount, I was talking about the Hunter pet
[1:29:01] Zuldak: yeah congrsats, everyone can spend 300k+ gold on mats for the lego now
[1:29:10] supashanka: and they are planning on raising the bad luck thing percentage and its retroactive
[1:29:10] itsparvati: prob same with pet
[1:29:23] Ryok: i wish i could get that owl but man if like echo is gonna be able to boost it it's gonna be like 20mil xD
[1:29:54] Zuldak: @Ryok maybe wait till season 4 and see how it is.
[1:30:03] Ryok: i might be exaggerating but like a month ago when i checked their discord there wasn't a price listed ^^
[1:30:05] itsparvati: i just cant imagine spending that for a mount
[1:30:10] Zuldak: im hoping ti comes to 2 mil and i would buy a myth fyrrak kill for that
[1:30:27] Kurama__95: I'm praying I loot the mount on our first Fyrakk kill savixPraise
[1:30:37] Zuldak: River city Ransome?
[1:30:47] Zuldak: ransom*
[1:30:50] FrostDBeers: big trouble in little china
[1:31:26] mmeaxo: oooh i love your hair :o <3
[1:31:55] mindflayerMinis: Omg its Tony Danza!
[1:31:58] saga_no: I suppose it makes sense for the RWF guilds to offer boosts like that - people seem to buy them, and it would give the guilds gold for next RWF season
[1:32:06] Zuldak: oh dear
[1:32:10] Zuldak: the priest went splat
[1:32:16] Ryok: @Zuldak i would definitely take it for 2mil as well... probably i'm down to 450k xD
[1:32:49] Zuldak: realistically i look forward to farming Frank in 2028
[1:32:54] Ryok: problem* not probably xD
[1:32:59] mindflayerMinis: Its ok it will be available for tendies next x pac :P
[1:32:59] itsparvati: his guild is 9/9 so he may not have bought it
[1:33:02] Zuldak: and then getting the owl in 2030
[1:33:09] GreenArrowed: @saga_no yah that's 100p what they do.  after raid that's all a lot of them do.
[1:33:17] saga_no: Assuming Owl-boi is on Illidan - ...they're in a Mythic raiding guild
[1:33:48] Ryok: @Zuldak i wonder if there's a boss that makes soloing the raid hard/impossible merodyHmm like battle of dazaralor i think is unsoloable because of oppulence
[1:34:30] saga_no: They're listed on the guild's Mythic Raiding roster on IO, so... I doubt they bought the kill
[1:34:33] Zuldak: @Ryok you can solo oppulence now. Just ignore the side things and run down the middle. The problem is council after because they wipe your memory and give you no abilities
[1:34:45] Zuldak: also Rastakhan instantly MCs you when Bwom comes out
[1:35:20] saga_no: Also... love the Spriest's name
[1:35:52] Ryok: @Zuldak oh i didn't even remember those two xD that sucks i sure hope they make it soloable at some point because i cba looking for someone to farm it with D: i should've just bought the mount when it was cheap
[1:36:09] Neltalie: hi hazel and chat :D happy wednesday
[1:36:21] saga_no: Wait - if they're grouped together with you in shuffle, that means they're in the same rank bracket, right? Just goes to show that Mythic raider does not automatically mean Gladiator
[1:36:41] itsparvati: pve very different than pvp
[1:36:43] Zuldak: @Ryok heh my guild used to sell the Jaina mythic mount. There was a creative use of game mehanics if you didnt kill the images
[1:36:54] 7thSaga: @Neltalie tasnPEACH
[1:36:57] saga_no: Gives me hope, honestly
[1:37:14] apheelia96: I just reclaimed Gilneas!
[1:37:28] saga_no: I do OK in raids; I like them - I enjoy the challenge - but they also stress me out a little. There is a VERY SLIM chance that I might do decently well in PvP.
[1:37:30] Ryok: @Zuldak yeah i wish i could've just bought it but i think i was still recovering from the bruto xD and just told myself "eh i'll just farm it in an expansion or two" xD
[1:37:44] saga_no: When I say OK in raids I mean I do what I'm supposed to but I struggle with pumping enough damage
[1:37:55] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[1:38:14] moletroll831: @HazelNuttyGames hey you know you can get 2 seeds in the waiting area before the game starts... so the next time u swiftmend you get a tree
[1:38:17] Kunozah: just reminded me I need to eat lunch lol
[1:38:49] itsparvati: going to have 2 seeds for lunch?
[1:39:18] saga_no: Speaking of - I learned the term "Almond Mom" yesterday and I'll never be the same
[1:39:33] Kunozah: I'm sorry... bread machine..?
[1:39:36] itsparvati: i enjoy making bread, but doing a starter is too much work for me
[1:39:42] Kunozah: I need one
[1:40:05] mindflayerMinis: Took a pasta making class last month...so much fresh pasta as of late
[1:40:15] itsparvati: @mindflayerMinis OH YUM
[1:40:53] itsparvati: do you reuse the discard from feeding, it feels wasteful
[1:41:07] TheRealRaiter: hi hazel. I watch your YouTube every week. Do you play any wotlk classic on here ever?
[1:41:24] Neltalie: what do u mean it gets hungry? i dont know much about sourdough
[1:42:16] itsparvati: @Neltalie you have to add flour and water every so often, its called feeding
[1:42:47] itsparvati: sourdough starter is basically having a colony of yeast as a pet
[1:43:44] Neltalie: ohhh thats pretty cool :D
[1:43:58] BoogiePonderosa: Yeastagochi
[1:44:09] saga_no: You have to burp it too, right?
[1:44:10] Zuldak: compare it to irish soda bread that uses  sodium bicarbonate instead of yeast
[1:44:24] cashthb: wtf, pandaren monks are actually cool
[1:44:30] BoogiePonderosa: and swadle it...
[1:44:36] mcxoney: when i was little kid i saw sourdough starter i was so scared of it
[1:44:50] Zuldak: there is so much science behind bread
[1:44:52] TheRealRaiter: I gave up retail after shadowlands, but haven‚Äôt give dragonflight a chance. Love wotlk. Wonder if you play it
[1:45:00] little_c2222: What do you do with the starter?
[1:45:16] itsparvati: the best part is sourdough starter grown in different areas will taste different
[1:45:47] saga_no: I googled cuz I'm curious. "I do NOT recommend storing your sourdough starter or discard in a jar with an airtight lid that clamps closed unless you're using your starter more than once a week. Those need to be "burped" (opened) regularly to let gas out. Sourdough starter can be stored at room temperature or in the fridge"
[1:46:16] itsparvati: lol thats how you make a sourdough bomb
[1:46:25] TheRealRaiter: can she only see certain levels of chat?
[1:46:48] itsparvati: no, she is focusing on game and only catches some when she gets back
[1:47:07] saga_no: I've never attempted to make sourdough, I've just heard of people feeding and burping theirs LUL
[1:47:24] Stariskatja: i used cheese cloth to cover my starter.
[1:47:36] supashanka: You don't miss 3 hours of pvp in icecrown doing dailies?  lol
[1:48:34] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: hii
[1:48:41] TheRealRaiter: Right on. I love wrath. My favorite expansion but your weekly videos are making me think I need to give dragonflight a chance. I love raiding and your boss videos look like the dragonflight raids are a lot of fun but very complex. Are they puggable?
[1:48:46] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: did you dye your hair
[1:48:49] Zuldak: is this the final match for the mount?
[1:48:55] TaliesinAndEvitel: 433 raiders from TaliesinAndEvitel have joined! 
[1:48:56] Streamlabs: taliesinandevitel just raided the channel with 433 viewers!
[1:48:58] Kurama__95: @TheRealRaiter When she PvPs it's hard for her to see and interact with chat all the time. To your question, she doesn't play WotLK, only retail and hardcore (on ocasion)
[1:49:01] Quachiri: hazelWave hazelWave hazelWave
[1:49:06] saga_no: @TheRealRaiter I would argue they are more puggable than Wrath / Classic raids seem to b e
[1:49:07] supashanka: oh, doing the tourny dailies would have grudge matches to get them done lol
[1:49:07] saga_no: be*
[1:49:11] ApolloRache: We taliezin
[1:49:12] Perkolate: hazelLove hazelLove hazelLove
[1:49:23] Quachiri: tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:49:27] wolfcloudchaser80: Hiya raiders!
[1:49:27] anker_jym: I'm so close to getting all the mounts from Argent Tournament. I just need to build up the motivation to do the final push lol
[1:49:35] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: love your hair
[1:49:36] brazkat: im 7% away from mounts
[1:49:38] brazkat: mount*
[1:49:53] itsparvati: i like to make a no knead overnight bread. it has a very hint of sourdough taste but doesn't require keeping a starter around
[1:50:26] saga_no: @TheRealRaiter And - the fights aren't as complex as they may seem at first :) I can only speak for myself but I went from zero raiding experience to AOTC within 2 seasons last year
[1:50:27] brazkat: i have officially completed every set on every class up to ulduar now!
[1:50:34] TheRealRaiter: pvp in wrath wasn‚Äôt great but I prefer pve anyways. Been working on heroic lk for weeks. Even with the 30% buff he‚Äôs so damn hard
[1:50:39] marbared: nytimes no knead - so good
[1:50:40] GreenArrowed: i love a poolish started bread so so much
[1:50:58] Zuldak: ever made garlic baked into the bread?
[1:51:00] itsparvati: flour water salt yeast, very good book for the bread making fans out there
[1:51:24] Zuldak: garlic rosemary bread
[1:51:32] saga_no: Garlic rosemary bread is the best
[1:51:40] TheRealRaiter: Dragonflight raids also look a little rough on the graphics card for my computer which DC sometime on heroic marrowgar cause of all the fire lol
[1:51:48] BoogiePonderosa: (whimpers in celiac)
[1:52:03] itsparvati: @BoogiePonderosa i feel for you friend
[1:52:09] marbared: my condolences
[1:52:11] saga_no: @TheRealRaiter Maybe... but they still work fine / you won't be at a huge disadvantage at a lower resolution
[1:52:12] GreenArrowed: yaaaaaaaay
[1:52:14] Zuldak: we're freeee
[1:52:15] 7thSaga: NCIE GRATZ HAZEL
[1:52:15] goplacidly56: Grats!
[1:52:17] anker_jym: Wahoo!!!!!!!!!!
[1:52:19] Stariskatja: grats!!
[1:52:19] Neltalie: wooooo gz
[1:52:22] cashthb: but can it do a backflip?
[1:52:23] dancingbalrog: grats!!
[1:52:29] ravenstarr: Nice!
[1:52:29] heldtheline: hazelTen  congrats!
[1:52:33] lykynn: grats
[1:52:34] BoogiePonderosa: @itsparvati hazelLove :D
[1:52:35] Kurama__95: @TheRealRaiter Until last october, I raided on a laptop with integrated graphics card and 8GB RAM. The game looked ugly but I could do content just fine LUL
[1:52:36] Ryok: doodClap
[1:52:48] anker_jym: Now your Druid can take a nap.
[1:52:52] Zuldak: the good thing about being anti-social is you dont care if you smell from all the garlic you can eat :D
[1:52:53] Kurama__95: It's been 84 years of Solo Shuffle savixOld
[1:52:56] TheRealRaiter: hazel, we‚Äôve had like no snow here in Minnesota this winter, have you got much in Canada?
[1:53:21] Zuldak: is it time to celebrate by slapping Harland for a bird?
[1:53:41] GreenArrowed: no snow or like, not the snow minnesota is used to?
[1:53:53] OILTIME: Absolutely buried in snow on the east coast.
[1:53:54] Jvanbeezy: Hardly any snow here in NB... but 6 hours away in NS they got hit with 160cm in a weekend...
[1:53:59] marbared: I hear he‚Äôs dropping parrots today
[1:54:09] GreenArrowed: i'm surprised there still snow on the ground here in nyc
[1:54:10] TheRealRaiter: @Kurama__95 right on
[1:54:13] itsparvati: CT still has snow on the ground, after a week. it normally melts faster
[1:54:23] goplacidly56: looking good!
[1:54:25] fisherreads: i love the owl bear models
[1:54:35] anker_jym: Do you get the Horde color too?
[1:54:36] BoogiePonderosa: so.. is there no aotc mount? i kept hearing there was...
[1:54:45] Ryok: this mount is cool... but pvp isn't xD
[1:54:48] GreenArrowed: cuuute
[1:54:56] BoogiePonderosa: flags!
[1:54:56] Kurama__95: @BoogiePonderosa It's a drakeriding manuscript, a Shadowflame Fyrakk transformation
[1:54:58] itsparvati: i get its a pvp mount so it needs armor, but i dont like the helm. you cant see its cute face
[1:55:00] SerThunderbeans: We've had more than a meter all through the winter even in the southernmost part of Finland this year! FeelsGoodMan Exceptionally cozy! And we just got some more!
[1:55:01] Hellm0uth: hardly any snow here in NW Ontario now
[1:55:07] BoogiePonderosa: that'll be tough getting thru doors
[1:55:12] TheRealRaiter: i haven‚Äôt used my snowblower once this year in Minnesota and haven‚Äôt been able to ice fish at all. Only fishing I‚Äôve been doing is on Warcraft lol
[1:55:12] saga_no: I want this mount. I'll get it off the vendor when it pops up. Assuming I'll have unlocked it.... hehehe
[1:55:14] marbared: there is an aotc mount. it is ugly
[1:55:21] Ryok: i would love to have some of the vicious mount but i think i'll just stick with the spider for now xD
[1:55:26] BoogiePonderosa: @Kurama__95 oh right! thx
[1:55:38] marbared: I went there üòÇ
[1:55:47] jeffdmk: calling a mount ugly makes it hazels new favorite mount
[1:55:50] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[1:55:53] Kurama__95: Defend Frank's honor
[1:56:15] Zuldak: the rasagath is better looking imho
[1:56:18] anker_jym: The only option is Mak'Gora
[1:56:25] GreenArrowed: i like the shadowflame effects a lot
[1:56:28] Ryok: weird that the rare drop from any difficulty is rarer than the aotc one xD
[1:56:50] itsparvati: i havent bothered collecting dragon skins. i love the tree dragon for my druid
[1:56:51] TheRealRaiter: Congrats
[1:56:58] BoogiePonderosa: hazelShiny hazelLurk hazelTen
[1:57:09] Kurama__95: I sense freehold runs in the horizon
[1:57:21] caradosailanthus: Yay!  Kitty cat stream!
[1:57:29] itsparvati: TW week=alt leveling for me

[1:59:37] marbared: oh I was wrong. was thinking of the M+ mount. now *that* one is ugly
[1:59:49] itsparvati: such a sweetie kira is
[1:59:55] itsparvati: oh no, blurry kitty
[1:59:56] anker_jym: Ooh, I forgot it's TW week. Got a few alts to level, and have been a little tired of DF leveling.
[2:00:07] eternitycrystal: your cat is so cute
[2:00:37] itsparvati: how old is kira now? i feel like she has always been with us on stream
[2:00:45] heldtheline: is Moose still doing better?
[2:01:21] marbared: one of our cats met a neighbor today on the deck. they were not polite.
[2:01:33] Marmoh: Is there a reward for the achievement?
[2:01:41] Ryok: did you see the trailer for the elden ring dlc?
[2:01:42] itsparvati: my friends have been into enshrouded
[2:01:55] itsparvati: its an early release, and pretty good
[2:01:55] saga_no: Soulsborne seems to be just Full Tilt Boogie all around
[2:02:16] marbared: you done w/ Palworld?
[2:02:16] JimmyJosser: your DS2 DLC guides were so useful!
[2:02:17] Ryok: i watched the trailer but it didn't tell me anything because i've maybe seen 2 hours of the game xD
[2:02:23] BoogiePonderosa: yes?
[2:02:58] eziekiyah: so which one are you? ;)
[2:03:19] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: HAZEL! The wig looks SO green! Is it warm?
[2:03:33] saga_no: I have Dark Souls (the first one, remaster - I think) and Elden Ring on Steam.... maybe I should make that my gamer girl mission - git gud in Soulsborne games
[2:03:45] DestinamueGaming: greetings
[2:03:46] JimmyJosser: i remember watching them to help me get through the crown of the sunken king dlc area, i hated that place!
[2:03:50] cashthb: ngl fromsoftware games are not that hard on the large scheme of things
[2:04:00] marbared: your pet is taller than you :D. I'm sure you already knew this but I was entertained
[2:04:41] eternitycrystal: I am playing wow for 15 years now never like any other game, am I crazy?
[2:05:00] itsparvati: @eternitycrystal we all always return here
[2:05:13] eternitycrystal: @itsparvati the thing is I never left
[2:05:21] saga_no: I think I also picked up Dark Souls on the Switch so I can tilt both in front of my computer and in bed...
[2:05:57] blueboywiz: true but beating the fight is worth it
[2:06:12] azrazil720: I feel the same way about making curveball throws in Pok√©mon Go, when am I ever gonna use that skill? üòÇ
[2:06:50] saga_no: @azrazil720 I would comment on that - but this is a PG stream...... ;P

[2:07:46] GreenArrowed: have you been playing enshrouded?
[2:08:05] cashthb: there are some truly bullshit games, fromsoft stuff is not even close, the first searious sam on hardest difficulty is the first thing that comes to my mind
[2:08:24] Zuldak: fun fact: the director of Mad Max, George Miller,  also directed Babe
[2:08:41] anker_jym: Haven't thought about that movie in years. Core memory unlocked
[2:08:48] Ryok: @cashthb devil may cry 3/4 on heaven or hell difficulty for me
[2:09:00] Zuldak: it can be wild how different movies a director can have under their belt
[2:09:16] Zuldak: how different movies can be directed by the same person*
[2:09:16] Ryok: @cashthb or was it called hell or hell merodyHmm it's been too long since i 100%ed those games
[2:09:31] BoogiePonderosa: yeah that will always be tough
[2:09:38] heldtheline: Charlotte's Web is a bit heartbreaking. Love that spider. <3

[2:09:47] BoogiePonderosa: "i'm sorry you're my food!" :(
[2:09:52] Zuldak: Robin Williams once did a horror movie and it was beyond creepy
[2:10:04] saga_no: @Zuldak Was that the Photography one?
[2:10:12] saga_no: One Hour Photo or whatever it was called?
[2:10:15] Zuldak: @saga_no yes
[2:10:39] GreenArrowed: i think it's the first book taht made me cry
[2:10:43] GreenArrowed: it's traumatizing
[2:10:45] Zuldak: The Brave Little Toaster was the movie that made me cry as a kid
[2:10:51] GreenArrowed: i've only seen bambi twice for the same reason
[2:11:05] eternitycrystal: austin powers
[2:11:05] Zuldak: the first part of up
[2:11:06] ravenstarr: bridge to terabithia was the first book that made me cry
[2:11:08] heldtheline: They traumatised us a lot in school. Charlotte's Web, Where the Red Fern Grows, Bridge to Terabithia, etc.
[2:11:08] saga_no: Neverending Story.
[2:11:09] jeffdmk: donation goal to watch charlotte's web
[2:11:09] antiva: watership down for me
[2:11:09] Zuldak: like the first 10 min
[2:11:12] spookysnaxx: Ten things I hate about you
[2:11:17] GreenArrowed: the end of the return of the king still makes me cry
[2:11:24] Zuldak: @saga_no ARTAX!!!!
[2:11:25] saga_no: It both traumatized me and made me ugly-cry as a kid
[2:11:31] anker_jym: Toy Story 3
[2:11:31] dakoto70: Yes a few movies I watch if I want to have a good cry
[2:11:34] sleighher: what you trying to get Hazel ?
[2:11:40] Ryok: idk if a movie ever made me cry... i guess the closest was probably the swamp horse scene in neverending story merodyHmm that one at least traumatized me a lot xD
[2:11:40] Curufin_: dont watch Marley and Me then xD
[2:11:42] wolfcloudchaser80: The last episode of Babylon 5.
[2:11:44] eternitycrystal: Austin powers, I am crying because it's so funny
[2:11:46] cashthb: I'm too manly cry on a movie, the ending of ori 2 is really nasty tho
[2:11:48] dakoto70: and I have one I watch to make me happy.. My cousin vinny is my happy movie
[2:11:50] Zuldak: @saga_no the worg from that movie actually gave me nightmares
[2:11:51] saga_no: I don't remember the black dog / wolf's name - in the little cave - but it scared the crap outta me.... and the whole scene with the horse is just... oof
[2:12:13] GreenArrowed: lol omg sounder
[2:12:16] Zuldak: the wolf's name in never ending story was... gamork i think?
[2:12:17] Ryok: @saga_no oh hey we have the same childhood trauma xD
[2:12:23] heldtheline: I'm old so the first movie for me was My Girl. He needs his glasses :(
[2:12:26] antiva: yeah animal death always makes me cry/upset
[2:12:30] anker_jym: Although, I will admit. I cried at the end of Avengers Endgame. I won't spoil it just in case
[2:12:32] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[2:12:42] SisterCoyote: That website is in fact called "does the dog die" and they have LOTS of other categories, too.
[2:12:48] BoogiePonderosa: That's a mega-franchise
[2:12:50] Zuldak: 'there's no rules saying a dog can't play'
[2:12:53] Ryok: @eternitycrystal spaceballs is that funny to me xD favorite comedy movie of all time
[2:12:56] GreenArrowed: oh that's weird
[2:13:05] Zuldak: that was the era of kid sports movies like Mighty Ducks and D2 Mighty Ducks
[2:13:10] Zuldak: Might Giants
[2:13:11] SisterCoyote: It's either in the Vault or they've put the kibosh on it for some "problematic" reason. :/
[2:13:15] Jnxz: got sharkbate from reins mount in Rise last night. had been farming forever
[2:13:16] Zuldak: Mighty Giants...
[2:13:20] BoogiePonderosa: Just Watch says it's on D+
[2:13:24] itsparvati: i had a craving to watch star trek the other night, need to reup my paramount sub
[2:13:25] BoogiePonderosa: airbud that is
[2:13:25] saga_no: Neverending Story traumatized me to the point where I would have recurring dreams in which the dreams would start with me opening the book (like in the movie)... and when the dream ended, I closed the book; the next night I would open the book again (in the dream) and continue where I left off....
[2:13:26] jeffdmk: There actually are rules saying a dog cant play
[2:13:32] supashanka: Its because Bud wanted to much in royalties.
[2:13:36] SisterCoyote: Listen. Listen. Y'all want animals playing sports look up Gus.
[2:13:52] GreenArrowed: i wonder if it's on amazon
[2:13:54] SisterCoyote: Gus the football playing mule.
[2:13:55] Zuldak: no no Little Giants was the movie... with Rick Morannis
[2:13:58] antiva: have you watched/follow eurovision? :)
[2:13:59] GreenArrowed: amazon has sucha. weird mix of movies
[2:14:10] wolfcloudchaser80: Gus Gus Movie-Gus?
[2:14:17] GreenArrowed: it's a weird experience
[2:14:29] SisterCoyote: Not Gus-Gus the mouse.
[2:14:35] SisterCoyote: Not Cinderella.
[2:14:35] anker_jym: Now TV shows on the other hand, I've cried in quite a few. Monk, Stranger Things. Heck, I've cried in some of the Star Wars TV shows lol
[2:14:38] Calaxandra: That's the problem I have with Prime as well! I gave up.
[2:14:38] MaddiDJ4: lol I know that they have country locks because when I used a VPN to get past my school‚Äôs data blocker I‚Äôd link to Canada and watch a few Hulu shows on D+
[2:14:40] SisterCoyote: Gus the goal-kicking mule.
[2:14:41] itsparvati: yeah, prime suggestions are 90% things i need to buy and not included
[2:14:56] BoogiePonderosa: yeah prime is bothersome like that.. it used to be worse too :O
[2:15:02] saga_no: The country licensing of Netflix is so annoying sometimes; people will suggest things on there for me to watch, and it won't be available...
[2:15:21] BoogiePonderosa: hazelLove
[2:15:21] itsparvati: winks at the prime sub active for hazel right now
[2:15:23] GreenArrowed: when i was little i would cry watching the wiz bc the scene in the subway station used to scare me
[2:15:27] mistresss9: cute hair!
[2:15:30] anker_jym: There you go, get that shameless promotion lol ;)
[2:15:32] spookysnaxx: Did you get the vicious mount?
[2:15:37] SisterCoyote: I'm actually not sure where my prime sub is right now LOL
[2:15:48] spookysnaxx: Wooooooohooooooo well done ü§òüèª
[2:15:54] Zuldak: there are just too many streaming services today. Hulu, netflix, amazon prime streaming, apple tv...
[2:16:01] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no The VPN thing does sometimes work. That's how I see the BBC's Antiquest Roadshow sometimes.
[2:16:02] heldtheline: Prime's a good value; sub, free shipping, video, and the gaming stuff (HS cards, OW stuff)
[2:16:04] 7thSaga: tasnBOMB
[2:16:05] SisterCoyote: We got AOTC last night. Well. I got AOTC, the guild got it the week before *laugh*
[2:16:08] antiva: do we have a season end date yet?
[2:16:15] dakoto70: @SisterCoyote I can't figure out where mine is either :(
[2:16:26] 7thSaga: LUL Hazel
[2:16:35] 7thSaga: hazelShy
[2:16:51] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 My NetAdmin/SysAdmin husband would object to a VPN he did not clear for use I think ;P
[2:16:56] eternitycrystal: shyzel
[2:16:58] Zuldak: you can subscribe without alerts i think
[2:17:03] BoogiePonderosa: i just launched D+ app and Airbud is there :) but maybe it's limited in Canada :\
[2:17:05] anker_jym: I get that. You don't want to get the call out
[2:17:16] SisterCoyote: antiva I don't think so.
[2:17:32] saga_no: What really annoys me to no end, though, is when a show is ONLY available on HULU.
[2:17:36] itsparvati: it would still pop on their stream wouldnt it
[2:17:39] SisterCoyote: And yeah, I get that Hazel. I just have no presence on Twitch so it matters less LOL
[2:17:46] BoogiePonderosa: my daughter was into "Spooky Buddies" a halloween themed spin off with costumed puppies :)
[2:17:49] MaddiDJ4: get NordVPN to sponsor an AirBud watchalong
[2:18:03] BoogiePonderosa: oh yeah
[2:18:06] MaddiDJ4: @boogieponderosa i was your daughter but with Space Buddies
[2:18:07] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[2:18:17] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no To be honest, I'm getting annoyed with mine (Proton). Though I suspect it's more because other sites are detecting it's a VPN and restricting me because other people have used it to be naughty.
[2:18:26] BoogiePonderosa: @MaddiDJ4 haha :D
[2:18:32] saga_no: HULU is an America-only thing and even with a VPN, you can't access it because your payment is not American. it absolutely blows.
[2:18:33] anker_jym: You must watch Airbud with Moose
[2:19:05] BoogiePonderosa: our dog freaks every time a doorbell rings on tv
[2:19:23] eternitycrystal: @saga_no you can always torrent stuff :)
[2:19:25] antiva: pupper doesnt know whats going on, but is very happy to take part in it
[2:19:32] SisterCoyote: Their eyesight, while different than ours, isn't colorblind so he can see the stuff and track the movement.
[2:19:44] MaddiDJ4: when my brother was a toddler he‚Äôd get really excited when I played Animal Crossing. he‚Äôd ask me every so often to play fish so he could watch
[2:19:50] SisterCoyote: My cat has tried several times to attack my dragon while I'm flying.
[2:19:54] saga_no: @eternitycrystal I am not about to risk my $5000 laptop by downloading a torrent.
[2:20:19] BoogiePonderosa: haha cute
[2:20:31] eternitycrystal: @saga_no what kind of risk? Torrents are mostly save, there are well known torrent websites
[2:20:33] itsparvati: my kitty would do that with cat tv, she would search for the squirrel behind the tv
[2:20:49] saga_no: @eternitycrystal "mostly safe" - ..that is the risk
[2:20:58] saga_no: I ain't doing it.
[2:21:16] MaddiDJ4: something about my grandparents‚Äô dogs do something similar. when any sort of animal or thing with fur comes on they go nuts. watching the grinch this Christmas was something else
[2:21:19] eternitycrystal: @saga_no last time I got a trojan was 12-13 years ago I still torrent nonstop :)
[2:21:20] SisterCoyote: I can't watch cat videos in my house, especially kitten videos, with the sound on or my cat goes DESPERATELY looking for the baby.
[2:21:22] anker_jym: I have some really cute videos of my sister's cat swatting at the screen while I'm playing WoW, back when he was the size of a WoW plushie lol
[2:21:32] saga_no: @eternitycrystal Well - you do you, boo. I am not doing it.
[2:21:41] eternitycrystal: @saga_no :D
[2:21:50] saga_no: Exactly...
[2:21:59] anker_jym: @maddidj4 My son does the same thing with my wife. She's the Animal Crossing player in the house lol
[2:22:06] eternitycrystal: btw torrenting is not illegal, it's a way of transferring data like downloading.
[2:22:21] saga_no: @eternitycrystal Respect Hazel's wishes and stop, please.
[2:22:26] saga_no: we're not promoting it here.
[2:22:46] saga_no: (...and for what it's worth - it's still illegal in some countries and this is an international chat.)
[2:22:54] Marmoh: That Marshal npc is so tall
[2:23:12] Marmoh: Like yes, look down on me when I approach
[2:23:36] magicblue: @Marmoh lol
[2:23:45] MaddiDJ4: @anker_jym when he was even younger, like baby baby, he used to love splatoon because of all the colors. now he knows more about minecraft than me, and I‚Äôm 12 years older than him
[2:24:04] Kurama__95: I wish I was STACKED with Marks of Honor to buy transmog, but can't really expect to have them when I don't PvP LUL
[2:24:23] anker_jym: @maddidj4 ooh, Splatoon would be a good game for babies!
[2:24:31] heldtheline: And that's in a few weeks! :D
[2:24:43] shuuuuuuuuuuuuu: HSCheers
[2:25:13] Queerfocused: Hi Hazel. Working on Argent tournament. Is a slow grind
[2:25:19] jeffdmk: comp stomp is the most boring thing ever but it is super fast marks especially early in the week
[2:25:21] Kurama__95: I spammed Comp Stomp to farm Flightstones early in the season, and it was so mind-numbing, but yeah I did get some marks LUL
[2:25:31] heldtheline: I like Comp Stomp for classes/specs I don't usually play; it's a good way to feel them out with getting people too upset
[2:25:40] antiva: do you work out? if you do, then whats your favourite exercise to do? :)
[2:26:00] cashthb: how much you bench?
[2:26:17] antiva: at least a kilo 8)
[2:26:23] Zuldak: get back to rock climbing and work on the squeezers
[2:26:29] dlllont: are you natty?
[2:26:35] anker_jym: Bench Moose as a starter goal
[2:26:40] antiva: hiking is wonderful though
[2:26:59] antiva: climbing sounds scaaary!
[2:27:20] MaddiDJ4: what is comp stomp?
[2:27:49] marbared: post workout sleep is the best
[2:27:53] antiva: have you gone hiking on any mountains?
[2:28:02] cara2997: cara2997 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:28:02] Streamlabs: cara2997 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:28:32] itsparvati: my uncle used to hike in the alps, crazy stuff
[2:28:33] Zuldak: come back to oregon and start climbing the east face of hood
[2:28:45] wolfcloudchaser80: I just want you to look at the rocks when you go hiking and fishing. I want you to find some Dallasite.
[2:28:55] antiva: oh yeah i wasnt expecting like mount everest climbing haha
[2:29:08] saga_no: Visit Norway... hike the madness
[2:29:10] Zuldak: Hopefully you went to Trilium lake once
[2:29:24] cashthb: even considered getting into power slapping? I'm sure there are wight classes
[2:29:27] saga_no: Pulpit Rock. Is one helluva hike.
[2:29:31] antiva: ahh i used to go fishing a lot as a kid with my dad, but now i feel too bad for the fishies :(
[2:30:08] frostbot98: howd you get over anxiety to drive
[2:30:22] wolfcloudchaser80: I've never seen it myself, just online. It's kinda agate-like, but the really nice ones have bands of green and blue.
[2:30:42] antiva: oh goodness, i have to get a license at some point and im scared
[2:30:59] MysteriousMind: I feel that, I have the famous Black Forest here in Germany in driving distance and I never visited until recently, a total crime it is stunning!
[2:31:02] cashthb: aw, there isn't a womans bracket, I guess it wouldn't be that cinematic
[2:31:06] MaddiDJ4: how would you recommend helping someone with driving anxiety, so far I‚Äôve tried exposure but my partner does not drive. he has a license but refuses to use it Yanno?
[2:31:16] antiva: anxious girlies unite ü§ù
[2:31:18] Archont1978: chat: is this transmog runs or something else?
[2:31:18] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Oh god... that's the thing Tom Scott went out on once, I think? I'm not scared of heights, but rocks+heights are a big nope.
[2:31:21] itsparvati: the only time im not anxious while driving is on back country roads, city or highway forget it, im a mess
[2:31:30] antiva: @Archont1978 mount run
[2:31:42] Archont1978: @antiva Thanks!
[2:31:44] eternitycrystal: but having too much anxiety can tire you a lot. I had it for years
[2:31:54] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Maaaybe? I'm not sure; hang on..
[2:32:22] saga_no: Yuup. Google found the video he did
[2:32:30] dakoto70: sometimes my anxiety is so bad when I am driving that I actually cry the whole way to where I need to go
[2:32:52] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 The impressive part is that it's CHOCK FULL of tourists during summer. Like every day.
[2:33:05] itsparvati: i will go miles out of the way to avoid traffic circles
[2:33:25] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no It's funny, that would scare me. Yet I've gone skydiving twice and absolutely loved it.
[2:33:41] antiva: stresses. "hey thats not good for you" then stress about the health problems that come from stress on top of original stress lol
[2:33:57] MaddiDJ4: doctor told me to reduce stress for my headaches. yet here I am, leaving work early with a headache
[2:34:12] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I've never been myself, neither Pulpit Rock nor skydiving - I'm not fit enough for the hike
[2:34:22] anker_jym: Hazel, I'm the same way. I hate not being able to preplan a route. And Google Maps does NOT help most of the time.
[2:34:36] itsparvati: people in the US suck at traffic circles. my own driving doesn't make me anxious, its other people
[2:34:55] MaddiDJ4: I‚Äôm trying not to force him, but give him the opportunity. I cant blame his anxiety, I went downtown in my city twice in the past two weeks and I decided that was enough for the next 3 months
[2:35:47] saga_no: I actively decided I wouldn't get my driver's license when I realized I had no control over when my Panic disorder may hit... and a full-blown panic attack with disassociation is not something I'd want to have while driving
[2:35:47] antiva: driving during winter seems extra scary
[2:36:06] janahita: I feel the same, because one time I nearly didn't see a pedestrian and it freaked me out
[2:36:14] heldtheline: @itsparvati Yep. I panic in the car and always tell the driver that I trust them, I just don't trust everyone else on the road
[2:36:18] saga_no: brb
[2:36:23] cashthb: maybe you should get a cyber truck, being a tank should be pretty conforting... I mean sure the engine refusing to work in cold could be iffy in canada, but that would just help with the driving part of the anxiety even more!
[2:36:23] itsparvati: i would love to live in EU with well planned carless cities
[2:36:23] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Yeah, I'm out of shape enough that there's no long hikes for me anytime soon either.
[2:36:25] marbared: driving during winter w/out a handbrake is boring
[2:36:27] eternitycrystal: Well I live in the netherlands, my town is so good for bikes :D
[2:36:28] MaddiDJ4: now walkable cities? that‚Äôs the dream. I‚Äôd give up my license and car in a heartbeat for that
[2:36:28] IndigoCat: Have you been back in Canada for 4 years? The amount of time I am losing track of is strating to concern me.
[2:36:42] anker_jym: @antiva I feel that. I hate snow driving. But for some reason I don't mind rain driving.
[2:36:47] cashthb: @itsparvati hahahahahahahahahahahaaa
[2:36:48] Neltalie: i feel really lucky to live in a walkable city with great public transport
[2:36:49] MaddiDJ4: @indigocat felt. I remember when she got her license
[2:36:52] dakoto70: my biggest fear, when I am driving, is that my tires are going to fall off the front of my car and I am just going to roll over and over and over. It is awful.. I still drive but that is what plays in my head the whole time
[2:37:04] cashthb: @itsparvati they were planned like 400 years ago
[2:37:08] anker_jym: Was the instructor on Skype lol
[2:37:14] itsparvati: @itsparvati before cars
[2:37:17] Queerfocused: Hazel do you ever have issues with people not showing in your garrison after completing a garrison invasion?
[2:37:37] MaddiDJ4: I have a crippling fear of drunk drivers. I won‚Äôt drive on traditional party nights or weekends unless I have to
[2:38:26] dakoto70: @MaddiDJ4 I won't drive on the typical drinkng holidays either. I have never gone out on new years eve for fear of getting hit by a drunk driver.
[2:38:47] cashthb: what if they have a diarrhea?
[2:38:48] MaddiDJ4: pressure to speed is so bad where I am. I go the limit and everyone still passes me
[2:38:57] dakoto70: well, listening to every one, i feel better I am not alone lol
[2:39:24] janahita: The more that I drive a certain route the more confident I get, it's really practice too
[2:39:25] squishdotnet: I see we're doing Freehold now, did we get the vicious mount?
[2:39:41] antiva: girlbossing
[2:39:45] dakoto70: Yes, even though I am petrified, I still drive :)
[2:39:53] anker_jym: But Hazel, I thought all Canadians were nice, does that not translate to on the road?
[2:40:04] MaddiDJ4: that‚Äôs how I felt with my first credit card bill for some reason. I am an adult, I‚Äôm planning for my future, and I should go on a walk
[2:40:36] IndigoCat: I feel that is common in Canada. It is rather inconvenient to not have a license and at least some access to a vehicle. Our public tranportation is rather lacking.
[2:40:42] anker_jym: Lol
[2:40:56] heldtheline: Carpooling!
[2:41:34] mokorii: calgary transit is awful, I used to live in victoria it was so much better
[2:42:15] anker_jym: Do you and partner each have your own car?
[2:42:15] MaddiDJ4: I appreciate busses, I just live too far out of town to take one
[2:42:19] squishdotnet: I see we're doing Freehold now, did we get the vicious mount? Û†ÄÄ
[2:43:28] antiva: oh yeah sometimes you just have to endure the anxiety and do it just to get the threshold to be better
[2:44:35] tehl00py: bad social anxiety here and it's just gotten worse w age xP
[2:44:37] GreenArrowed: i've never driven in NYC the thought makes me incredibly anxious. i let me friends drive me places and i don't even like that. the driving here is aggressive and gridlocked.
[2:45:00] Kurama__95: Navegating my life to avoid my feeling of anxiety leads me to simply isolating myself, which I'm not particularly unhappy about, but I always think of "what ifs"
[2:45:16] GreenArrowed: the worst thing about driving in SF is the hills
[2:45:25] GreenArrowed: it's like a rollercoster
[2:45:39] SavageNoble: Ah beautiful
[2:45:41] mokorii: I'm so happy my commute right now is just a 5 minute walk to work, I can't deal with transit anymore
[2:46:22] SavageNoble: I've only died once or twice while driving. It's fine
[2:46:42] databob1: I kean I only died that one time no biggy
[2:47:03] starthorium: im from australia but living in london would loveeee to do a year in vancouver isloand
[2:47:19] GreenArrowed: if I take the job I'm contracting for right now, I'll have to start commuting to work again, and I kind of hate that.
[2:47:29] Complete_Phased: Someone threw a stop sign at you? Why would they do that?
[2:47:48] anker_jym: Think someone already said it, but it really all boils down to this: I'm confident in my own driving skills, but I'm not confident in others
[2:47:54] SavageNoble: But imagine if you were a fluffy cloud üòå
[2:48:05] jeffdmk: hazel you are easily in the top 10% of driving competency

[2:50:13] jgbrit: Hazel, you know the 'I pitied the fool, Arathi Basin' achievement from Love is in the Air Meta, do you think the Arathi Blizzard map from the current brawl would count?

[2:53:58] antiva: good luck!
[2:54:05] SavageNoble: Almost

[2:55:53] heldtheline: @cashthb dreadwolf
[2:55:56] wolfcloudchaser80: I might learn how to Hearthstone a little if you did.
