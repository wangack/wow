[1:42:35] Breakdown_HC: you got a point tommay but what is the answer to his question? :D
[1:42:37] marcellofbrz: @TommyKayLIVE where did the RoN campaign ended yesterday?
[1:42:38] Cadurana: I feel "Logs" are only really there for the Ultra nerdy that was to optimize their built, or for the Mthic raiders.. where every little dps coutns
[1:42:46] monki_420: @flygvapnet That you prob are new to stream and don’t know that he’s killing stream with this shit
[1:42:46] Xaradoc: Logs are cool for people who wanna mega optimize but they are so unneccessary in a game where every muppen can clear the raids
[1:42:49] Nightbot: Help out this poor streamer by donating or subbing so he can get better quality for the best HOI4 gameplay.
[1:42:51] syzlak360: Nah bence you are right, logs are used in every level of raiding, it's a helpfull tool to analayze fights and player performance
[1:43:10] Bence9811: @syzlak360 ik, but he is a boomer, he will never understand
[1:43:12] Kryos_Pizza: kek

[1:43:33] shadowcompany6: CrungoSmile
[1:43:44] niongs: true, logs are useless in an easy game, dick measuring in WoW is really funny to watch though
[1:44:08] daciderearl: @marcellofbrz he beat it
[1:44:09] Flygvapnet: @monki_420 That makes no sense, I dont have to be new because I dont sub
[1:44:39] KaasKikkerKoning: sheep
[1:44:52] Flygvapnet: Whatever I dont want to spam tommys chat with this bro. Stop ruining the vibe tho just keep to urself man
[1:44:58] Bence9811: overheal is not counted as a good thing for logs
[1:44:59] Kryos_Pizza: logs were designed to inform you on your rotations and all, not to become a treshold so yeah it became awful
[1:45:08] niongs: it doesn't matter if people don't die you are good

[1:45:30] monki_420: @flygvapnet it’s just the trend, you don’t have to fight about it, just use your head and stop acting protective over some streamer, finished now
[1:45:36] Bence9811: logs is really useful if you know what you are looking at and how you can improve yourself
[1:45:48] jassafstuhldichein: more important if there is Pinball game
[1:46:00] shadowcompany6: KEKW

[1:46:03] azprinzo: can i suck too
[1:46:19] Breakdown_HC: idk i did play the loggame but its nuts and easily gameable. imagine even in wow classic you could clear ubrs with 1 healer and scholomance without a tank
[1:46:30] jassafstuhldichein: can i get this on the Board  ?
