[2:32:40] DarkologyGG: what was the ping at LAN?
[2:32:41] shameshady: as an AWC enjoyer, with limited insight, the level of of play in this tournement was probably the highest I have seen (again, with my limited insight).. so even with ping the quality was high
[2:32:50] el_beko90: when gaming on this high level ping definetly has an affect, there shouldnt be a discussion
