[2:03:29] Arcsilin: @albinogran i suppose everyone has a different view point i think its still fun
[2:03:52] Nicholas909: you dont think next raid's gear will replace this raid's? @StaysafeTV
[2:03:59] Arcsilin: @albinogran just not many new good games out rn
[2:04:19] tidy____: yes
[2:04:25] BIGRESTART: POGMILFKERS

[2:04:37] FknWorst: yes
[2:04:37] chickodie: they wont remove the lockout
[2:04:38] Zetherior: itll keep the lockout, but be GIGA XP im assuming @StaysafeTV
[2:04:40] craboskai: that would just remove the discovery part KEKL
[2:04:42] tidy____: so everyone will get all gear
[2:04:46] Arcsilin: stay safe has insider knowledge
[2:04:46] tidy____: + insane xp
[2:04:52] FknWorst: phase 2 BFD xp farm
[2:04:55] ThePlayerCoachStun: if we get the reports thats the case then I am going to start hitting all the quests as far as I can go for gold.
[2:04:57] SaxNViolins: SaxNViolins subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! sup boys!

[2:05:03] Raivan994: i'm over bfd honestly
[2:05:51] cloudstrife543: i play a shit ton, i have like 110 g
[2:05:55] PieceOfPanic: GDKP LUL
[2:05:59] seksmuhchine: yeah i almost have 1k
[2:06:06] Th3Whitey: ya its gross
[2:06:12] luzid7: people have 10 thousands of gold
[2:06:14] albinogran: @Arcsilin ya idk, if ur enjoying it thats great. Inflation and bot armies with blizzard with their head in the sand killed it for me. Also GDKP meta alreadyu at level 25 is so lame imo
[2:06:14] joLyole: invest in chronoboons stonks
[2:06:29] tidy____: gold wont have any value except in gdkps, its way too casual and the inflation will be insane
[2:06:29] BIGRESTART: ayaya
[2:06:33] tittycity: I just want my staff already only seen it once since the first lock out
[2:06:36] Th3Whitey: iv said that by lvl 60 this game might be so different then classic
[2:07:01] Angeroth: Tanking as a lock was fun during twins in AQ
[2:07:02] FriendmanBrother: it was awesome
[2:07:07] Arcsilin: @albinogran i dont find the gold inflation that bad but i have 4 toons a farmed quests for gold. i do not support gdkp's
[2:07:07] albinogran: true
[2:07:13] Humansoup: SO True
[2:07:24] FriendmanBrother: Meta rune streams pepeLaugh
[2:07:29] linkitcraig: triangle theory
[2:07:34] rocklyn11: lame
[2:07:35] itska97: meta rune was the closest we got to that
[2:07:36] IAmLubes: triangle theory
[2:07:55] spike82q: who even discovered paladin rune, i feel liek esfand knew about it adn instantly got it becaue thats what he is is a paladin
[2:07:58] Angeroth: something tells me we need to use DETECT Demon for next rune in p2 sodaS
[2:08:02] rocklyn11: yeah if we get runes account wide. not per tune
[2:08:03] spike82q: but thats only how i feel
[2:08:09] rocklyn11: toon*
[2:08:17] Nicholas909: fr
[2:08:19] Baratanis: like the earthshield one that takes a whole weekend logging on and off farming 2 fire spawns in stonetalon mountains that dont share drops with others in your group and have a <.05 drop chance
[2:08:20] MaleBanger: i wouldn't want them to timegate shit for runes
[2:08:23] SaxNViolins: sstvWAVE @Plathyy
[2:08:27] Nicholas909: heal 20 different beasts KEKW
[2:08:28] Humansoup: Yep lazy
[2:08:30] OrganikCum: kill 6 enemies with moonfire on the target
[2:08:33] SaxNViolins: agreed
[2:08:35] ajunta__: starsurge rune is sweaty at lvl 2 hahahah
[2:08:38] FriendmanBrother: Healing 10 different beasts NotLikeThis
[2:08:46] Raivan994: next warr rune : go kill topper mcNabb in stormwind
[2:08:55] Th3Whitey: shamans runes was shit
[2:09:01] Angeroth: like soul siphon life rune, no lock uses that
[2:09:06] rydemtb: @battyzzz eat a mushroom talk to a frog...real sweaty
[2:09:20] Nicholas909: personally i see a ton of pvp in these events
[2:09:20] gryphsx: YEP
[2:09:22] broccoliost: I really hope there are 0 npcs in the stv pvp event
[2:09:41] spike82q: i mean its pretty much the same as alteric valley no ? zug drek
[2:09:46] ajunta__: @DimensionGlitch do it at lvl 2 with no help and get back to me
[2:09:53] cloudstrife543: i like it
[2:09:56] lilty92: And they made the event to the same zone as the raid so there are raids ganking at the entrance . . .
[2:10:01] seksmuhchine: it's better on smaller servers
[2:10:10] rydemtb: @battyzzz gamer NotLikeThis
[2:10:12] Raivan994: @broccoliost watch it be a capture the "hakkar shrine" like the auchinodun buff thing
[2:10:18] seksmuhchine: still lacking
[2:10:18] craboskai: COPIUM holy
[2:10:19] cloudstrife543: true
[2:10:20] Humansoup: sstvWAT
[2:10:21] albinogran: Ashenvale event is not fun at all imo
[2:10:24] Angeroth: Kappa
[2:10:25] korjillah: cope
[2:10:29] AntarcticTreaty: Aggrend backpedals in PVP
[2:10:35] chunky1983: we had a 4 raid vs 4 raid pvp battle today for like 30 min on our server
[2:10:37] luzid7: the whole zone is trash. world pvp in classic is just so toxic so much people suck in pvp and think they need to grp up and kill solo player the whole day...
[2:10:37] itska97: i think they are gonna avoid the boss part of it in P2 at least hope so
[2:10:44] itska97: in STV
[2:10:44] spike82q: at least you can duel in ashenvale afterwords right
[2:10:50] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I think he's right, but it's still an excuse
[2:10:50] kasualkaliber: so he's calling it a funeral
[2:10:52] chickodie: yea it sucks, but at least its an event right... KEKW
[2:10:58] SaxNViolins: we have to remember.  this is basically a ptr. things will change I'm sure. The fact that Blizz was willing to take this step is a good thing.
[2:10:58] Humansoup: Agree
[2:11:03] moffz0r: I bet he votes for Biden
[2:11:04] Angeroth: if the zone gave like 20 rep per kill AFTER the event.... sure KEK
[2:11:07] Angeroth: KEKW
[2:11:26] Arcsilin: stv gonna be the same
[2:11:37] WHOisROXIS: @Angeroth people would abuse the shit of this xd
[2:11:39] yews: People will min max the fun out of everything, its hard to get good pvp when people just want to farm fast rep and get back to something else. Maybe stv is different if you can gain xp or something for kills
[2:11:39] luzid7: the next event will suck for 100% because it is world pvp and not like a 1v1 event
[2:11:51] BIGRESTART: Pepega
[2:11:54] itska97: yeah an they need to switch the new reps they added. need more ways besides hoping for a drop off a mob or chest huntingg kekw
[2:11:57] tsetse2fly: COPIUM
[2:12:08] moffz0r: STVietnam
[2:12:10] NotDessx: Why is arathi not the zone
[2:12:11] lizcat_: it’s going to be terrible
[2:12:14] tsetse2fly: in all of wow
[2:12:15] handovdoom666: i will avoid it for leveling
[2:12:16] albinogran: Why is he showing ICC
[2:12:18] gryphsx: stv gonna be unbelievably cancer
[2:12:18] Krtex: I never leveled there. LULW
[2:12:21] bpsy: Arathi Highland
[2:12:26] seksmuhchine: STVietnam O.O
[2:12:29] Th3Whitey: 100%
[2:12:30] ScarfaceCEO: Vietnam zone, Fortunate Son etc. .
[2:12:31] maverrick15: stv is whole server fights over the chest in the arena
[2:12:33] SaxNViolins: @Arcsilin and I'm fine with that. They'll take that data and change things for next season or flip this to Classic+
[2:12:35] tidy____: I'm worried ppl getting drained again from 3 day resets
[2:12:38] cyonara74: just dont come to stv
[2:12:40] luzid7: there will be way to much player it will suck
[2:12:43] obstata: but that sun turning red was sooooo kool its gonna b great
[2:12:53] Th3Whitey: what suck also blizzard will take forever to fix or patch
[2:13:17] luzid7: i hope you can make the same amount of honor and rep in bg*s without premades
[2:13:22] Arcsilin: he hasa been diligent he caes about the game forsure
[2:13:26] AceOfFlame: pretty sure no one cares about STV considering the only meta is just spam SM and go past stv and never go into stv
[2:13:31] OrganikCum: i would be fine with no real event for stv, get the zone to 100% through pvp and get 1k rep, something super simple
[2:13:32] FriendmanBrother: BabyRage hunters
[2:13:46] unscconnor2: Hunters belong in the gulag
[2:13:52] Arcsilin: @SaxNViolins true actually
[2:13:55] Raivan994: that was such a non issue
[2:13:57] spike82q: what would chat liek to see stv be ? maybe well discuss it after video
[2:14:02] ScarfaceCEO: Cant wait to level up our spells with our new gear.
[2:14:02] Th3Whitey: ya death to hunters
[2:14:09] Hydro1904: 100%
[2:14:10] tidy____: this problem feels much bigger in NA than Eu though
[2:14:16] Baratanis: it is wow
[2:14:18] itska97: yeah its bad out here
[2:14:19] Lionkingler1: flask gonna be 5k at 60 OMEGALUL
[2:14:22] lurkrr: what kind of tobacco do you chewq
[2:14:23] SaxNViolins: @Th3Whitey that's a crap take. They've been totally transparent so far with their changes.
[2:14:24] albinogran: MingLee MingLee
[2:14:35] booties_mcgee: i play on the pve server and havent really seen many gdkps
[2:14:37] maverrick15: “i want harder runes” okay clear the raid to get the rune then “omg why would you make it harder to get a rune”
[2:14:41] Krtex: I wonder if Blizzard will solve GDKP and gold selling just like did in end of BC. forsenKek
[2:14:51] BIGRESTART: @booties_mcgee dead server
[2:14:51] Lionkingler1: KEKL
[2:14:53] H___O___R___S___E: I would have imagined gold selling would not be as bad in SoD due to the level cap being low?
[2:14:57] moffz0r: that ain't nothing
[2:14:57] albinogran: holyyy
[2:15:03] NutterCircus: We already know Blizzards solution to gold selling is. They will sell it to us EleGiggle
[2:15:05] newby_lt: I'v turned on the hardcore addon to keep my newest toon SSF without the counting the hardcore part
[2:15:09] broccoliost: disgusting
[2:15:10] Varren__: reg mana pots are 80g
[2:15:12] itska97: they are wildin
[2:15:13] Volkner250: 700g wtf

[2:15:34] jaynkumz: bidenomics
[2:15:34] armega4432: the problem starts withthe people willing to buy the gold
[2:15:35] zergyo2: guld
[2:15:41] AntarcticTreaty: Blizzard are the real problem
[2:15:43] armega4432: look in the mirror some of you
[2:15:44] OrganikCum: we need to make azeroth great again
[2:15:44] chaospanzer: supreme power 849 right now kek
[2:15:45] Lionkingler1: insta perma ban for buying gold
[2:15:52] Krtex: Just ban bot gold farmers. 4Head
[2:16:05] magerinog: this music Kreygasm
[2:16:15] Arcsilin: just boost gold from selling trash
[2:16:18] N_Tys: perma bans!!!
[2:16:18] ThePlayerCoachStun: @StaysafeTV people have really been getting cracked down on gold. SWIM bought gold for years and years. Just bought gold in SOD and was punished a week later along with a few people he knows.
[2:16:18] ilikegoafk: they literally do nothing to gold buyers, its like they dont even care
[2:16:19] Lionkingler1: breaking TOS = perma ban
[2:16:27] DK_Ballsofsteel: BAN EM
[2:16:29] sorliee: Tie account registration to personal ID like in South Korea and then ban that personal ID
[2:16:30] Atomized: WTF don't ban them, go to their house an silence them forever.
[2:16:35] Hydro1904: and stop bots from mass reporting
[2:16:39] kodder12: why dont blizzard have some people playing the game themself and just ban ppl that is botting
[2:16:43] NutterCircus: Just make new Accounts EleGiggle
[2:16:51] N_Tys: and GDKP ban
[2:16:52] spike82q: IP bann as well so its not just  wat ever account there using( ie.  2-3 accounts)
[2:16:54] Lionkingler1: YEP include gdkp in that post @StaysafeTV
[2:16:55] PieceOfPanic: LUL
[2:16:58] Krtex: forsenKek
[2:17:00] corsair714: @kodder12 They used to but not its too much $ for them
[2:17:02] Angeroth: but people farmed 2k gold through QUESTS Kappa
[2:17:02] kodder12: if I was working in blizzard I`d ban hundreds of bots every day

[3:53:36] lbozoh: America needs to be pure capitalistic and just team up with China and dominate the earth

[3:54:17] WHOisROXIS: can you say somehting in german
[3:54:18] numblezzz: to truly defeat an enemy requires carpet bombing it into submission. hence US in germany and japan. and hence why modern war laws dont work

[3:54:51] sothis666: Clap
[3:55:00] ticeyx: i think america is isreal at this point, its too late to change that
[3:55:00] shaycwe: But America is ran by Israel bro
[3:55:07] lickmypetals: the only war the US has lost is vietnam
[3:55:11] slachi: Without help, there's a greater risk of Israel being conquerered, and if they get conquered, they 100% nuke the world
[3:55:14] NutterCircus: Iran
[3:55:15] tendollafatha: Israel is based
[3:55:15] aoe_enjoyer: Yemen Aware
[3:55:17] numblezzz: trump is awesome for his isolationism, first president in decades to not start a foreign conflict. sadly, a shill for israel
[3:55:18] AceOfFlame: Getting involved in a war that been happening for centurys should not be America or any other countrys problem
[3:55:25] dreadd39: @slachi we pray they get conquered
[3:55:30] naughtiemares: @numblezzz Carpet bombing is effective but an absolute crime against humanity, russia and germany both did it in WW2 and it just sounds like hell on earth
[3:55:31] zhuki: the world is our business
[3:55:34] papaw4w4: @lickmypetals I would say we didn’t do too great in the Middle East either

[3:55:38] Bronloch: once the AI is connected via Starlink and is placed into bipedal robots with functional hands to open doors and grasp humans its over!
[3:55:43] NutterCircus: Do some research on Henry Kissinger.
[3:55:45] aoe_enjoyer: we are the protectors of world business
[3:55:49] dreadd39: the only thing we should support for isr*el is its open borders
[3:55:52] trebolz: or libya
[3:55:55] lickmypetals: @papaw4w4 it was a complete failure but we didnt lose the war just wording
[3:55:55] numblezzz: @naughtiemares completely agreed. war is hell and leads to so many innocent lives lost. but its the cost of victory - you cannot make war humane
[3:55:56] ajunta__: syria is the only one i agree with. those kurds get shit on in world history
[3:55:58] trebolz: Sadge Ghadafi
[3:56:12] dantheman4489: @staysafetv we won’t detach… most of our top leadership in the US is dual citizenship with da jewz

[3:56:43] Lionkingler1: KEKBye MANUAL LABOUR
[3:56:47] dreadd39: @dantheman4489 an unfortunate truth. we need to cleanse our government and refuse any positions to anyone with dual citizenship
[3:56:50] herrmutterkorn: are these the same guys like yesterday?
[3:56:53] Grel420: if you an dodge a wrench ayou can dodge a ball

[3:57:24] Mmmarcoman: Not our business has very limited meaning compared to what it meant 100,150 years ago though
[3:57:33] unresolvedbroccoli: fire pot
[3:57:51] shaycwe: Prob is even as "pro palestinian", people take that as anti israeli. If israel wasnt ran by zionists id have no problems with it having its own land...but anti-zionist is now considered anti semetic which is just nuts to me
[3:57:52] idontdodmg: when is next reset for raid
[3:58:11] leden88: why would u stop its now time to parse
[3:58:12] dantheman4489: @dreadd39 that would be ideal if we had control of our country… but we have been unfortunately conquered.
[3:58:17] numblezzz: im totally fine with zionism. right of conquest. just dont do it with Western money YEP
[3:58:23] slachi: Becuase if Israel is destroyed Jews get genocided. It's simple

[3:59:32] KCYON: give it 10 years
[3:59:33] Krtex: So it has latency like normal satelite? sodaHmm
[3:59:34] seksmuhchine: fase 2 is as far away as i can grow half my chest hair
[3:59:39] idontdodmg: fiber isnt available everywhere dork
[3:59:42] slightlytox1c: I use starlink, and I live in the middle of the jungle in central america. It sucks for streaming, but it's solid for gaming
[3:59:50] numblezzz: @Krtex its lower latency cuz they satellites are very low orbit
[3:59:56] MrGoldB: @staysafe im in the middle of nowhere and I use starlink works great for me
[4:00:03] canisgray821: what ios your thought about house flipping?
[4:00:04] sirdreadeye: Starlink Mobility $250.00–$5,000.00/mo. 220Mbps 25–50ms $2,500.00
[4:00:04] NomNomCameron: I have starlink, I just got 100mps down 20mbps up, 45ms latency I could try streaming and see if it works?
[4:00:06] shaycwe: Bad internet is a deal breaker....always
[4:00:10] ilikegoafk: is starlink a elon musk company?
[4:00:16] numblezzz: @ilikegoafk correct
[4:00:21] jaeger4kd: Germany has good connection
[4:00:22] KCYON: whats the upload and download on starlink?
[4:00:28] idontdodmg: @NomNomCameron thats pretty good latency tbh
[4:00:36] NomNomCameron: @idontdodmg it's crazy to be honest
[4:00:37] Mmmarcoman: elon muska aka space karen
[4:00:41] rocknsake: have you ever seen the starlink array go by in the night sky?
[4:00:41] seksmuhchine: latency
[4:00:46] KCYON: interestingggg
[4:00:49] ilikegoafk: I wonder if he will use starlink for streaming on X
[4:00:49] inflictawarlock: Recently tweeted hes working on it
[4:00:49] rocknsake: it looks like an alien invasion at first
[4:00:58] fragmonkey71: BEGGING
[4:00:58] idontdodmg: is the ping stable? @NomNomCameron
[4:01:09] KCYON: latency will be quite a problem to solve, given satelites
[4:01:13] NomNomCameron: @rocknsake I saw it once... thought it was the apocalypse haha
[4:01:17] zhuki: @rocknsake he doesnt go outside
[4:01:29] SepeIio: peepoComfy palworld
[4:01:41] NomNomCameron: @idontdodmg I've never had an issue with it, if @StaysafeTV wanted me to try to help with finding its genuine viability I'd be happy to help.
[4:01:45] KCYON: they drive? cool
[4:01:49] xxLucas: I saw it out in the deset, didnt know what it was
[4:01:49] sirdreadeye: they are pretty cool.  like 10 in a row flying overhead
[4:01:50] xxLucas: scared me
[4:01:56] zaebot3000: peepoComfy Palworld!
[4:01:58] numblezzz: they go fast af to maintain low orbit
[4:02:04] ilikegoafk: lol thats crazy
[4:02:05] NomNomCameron: I'm in BF nowhere but I have fiber - starlink is always up as a backup for me but I keep my phone connected to it
[4:02:20] seksmuhchine: satellites if you can download some mem
[4:02:37] KCYON: but yeah honestly, we're living in a futuristic sci fi novel nowadays. and it all seems normal to us
[4:02:41] idontdodmg: you have fiber but use starlink as backup? dafuq xD
[4:02:58] NomNomCameron: haha - consistent internet connection is pretty important for me

[5:18:34] Vunoka: Fury warrior GIGACHAD
[5:18:37] ohioliving: ri[ boomys
[5:18:39] person1029492: wish*
[5:18:40] Lionkingler1: DKS with smourne tho
[5:18:43] gendryktv: only the peeps within striking distance of h lk, 20% buff onwards makes it pretty doable
[5:18:47] XxLurK: Oh how the turn tables have turned
[5:18:51] fenris_06: Big cock ?
[5:18:52] Varren__: they were caca in naxx....
[5:18:53] dirbagdan: its a warriors game baby GIGACHAD
[5:18:59] Frayeen: depends most dk players suck
[5:19:02] QuestFor420: hahahaha
[5:19:04] JfatTV: warrior gets to be top DPS for being most boring class
[5:19:07] Frayeen: just look at Nord in Nota he slaps meters
[5:19:14] dirbagdan: COPIUM
[5:19:14] Snappole_: and then they got glaive prio :s
[5:19:16] itsLayd: hell naaaah
[5:19:16] JimBobJr: its fine they'll probably never release that expansion again KEKL
[5:19:18] Cafe0le: tbc YEP
[5:19:20] Vunoka: Its the highest testosterone class, its natural for them to be superior. To all the warmane cucks who said warrior would be shit in wrath can  suck it
[5:19:21] Bare02: would you play tbc again?
[5:19:23] Lionkingler1: outland goated map YEP
[5:19:26] XxLurK: i misss shadowbot spammin
[5:19:29] Barcasaur: SoD continues into TBC
[5:19:29] greenvuvuzela: hunters rise up
[5:19:33] luzid7: tbc has the best talents for sure
[5:19:34] Vunoka: Madge
[5:19:35] dirbagdan: lol
[5:19:35] gendryktv: lets be honest tbc season of discovery is just around the corner
[5:19:35] seksmuhchine: nah warrior could still do some shit
[5:19:36] spike82q: *takes huge sniff of copium*
[5:19:40] Arcsilin: its debatable but TBC is unreal
[5:19:53] dirbagdan: laughs in recklessness
[5:19:55] Farenheight451: TBC sucked
[5:19:55] longsfellow1200: I love TBC
[5:19:58] seksmuhchine: but ok
[5:20:01] hot_souffle: TBC > Wrath
[5:20:02] ChillBreezes: Seed of corruption rune would be POGGERS
[5:20:05] Lionkingler1: talwar tho
[5:20:08] jonisyntinen: @StaysafeTV What do you think why Germans came help Finland in continuation War when Stalin ruled CCCP? And why Stalin killed about 60 million of their own people?
[5:20:20] spike82q: tbc holds a special lace in my heart ,
[5:20:25] Cafe0le: no sp gear DIESOFCRINGE
[5:20:56] spike82q: Rune to make it all frost damage , should rune slot
[5:21:02] longsfellow1200: The only thing they got wrong with TBC was "flying mounts"
[5:21:05] spike82q: shoulder ***
[5:21:12] dirbagdan: maybe theyll give you a spell like shadowflame or something which does shadow and fire dmg @StaysafeTV
[5:21:28] seksmuhchine: let bleeds if thjat happens
[5:21:35] Cley145: buff shadow bolt volley!
[5:21:35] Lionkingler1: ret dps will be horrible
[5:21:42] person1029492: critting dots on NPCs only for warlock and spriest is my biggest wish
[5:21:43] Cileth: shadowbolt volley is gonna slap
[5:21:56] Farenheight451: @Cley145 It will get buff at 26 when we get a new shadowbolt
[5:21:57] Cafe0le: why did they give mages even more aoe
[5:21:59] seksmuhchine: oh so chromie craft
[5:22:08] Vunoka: whats the lore with the name: staysafe?
[5:22:15] ticeyx: why would you say that? next phase hellfire is gonna be nuts, cast incin on something, get lake of fire up, hellfire its gonna do like 2x base damage, and shaowbolt volly is good too
[5:22:17] dirbagdan: they made mages so broken lol
[5:22:31] Cley145: @Cafe0le to make it more fun of course
[5:22:32] hot_souffle: Bad design
[5:22:33] luzid7: yeah they better should get something for pvp and not only farm shit
[5:22:39] feardotrun: locks have the best self healing in the game as DPS
[5:22:43] justsmilin247: lvl 60 is going to be wild
[5:22:43] seksmuhchine: can arms wars bleed?
[5:23:01] Cley145: @seksmuhchine probably once a month
[5:23:01] Cileth: it's good for bfd trash tbh
[5:23:03] dirbagdan: @seksmuhchine yes with rend and deep wounds but bleeds are such ass
[5:23:15] ticeyx: what sucks is theres no real reason to use shadowbolt volly now
[5:23:19] Ramblob: gnomer blows
[5:23:25] jakmko: 10 ftw imo
[5:23:29] ticeyx: yea they are lazy keeping it 10
[5:23:35] dantheman4489: @staysafetv a trippy rune would be you tanked as a felguard and the warlock was your pet.
[5:23:37] coolcrazyguy72: in 30 years when we are being uploaded into the meta verse are you going to stream?
[5:23:43] dirbagdan: man give us 20 and 40 mans i want big fucking raids
[5:23:43] Sohsuh: It will be 6 warriors
[5:23:44] NooleanB: 10 man probably means it wont be tightly tuned or hard
[5:23:45] indolent_sloth: But the summons!
[5:23:47] hot_souffle: at least 1 warlock, for summoning portal
[5:23:48] Ghoulls_: you think the new 60 raids will be 10mans too
[5:24:02] Cileth: my guess is the mobs won't all be mechs or be vulnerable to more types of damage
[5:24:04] seksmuhchine: @seksmuhchine against elementals
[5:24:11] ntb712: DEI
[5:24:15] person1029492: im sure they have some very intelligently designed runes for underperforming specs Kapp
[5:24:20] Cley145: and blizzard should know that diversity is our strength
[5:24:24] dirbagdan: 40 manraids just have such an epic vibe to them
[5:24:33] longsfellow1200: blizz might do it for later raids
[5:24:53] NooleanB: 20 man raids make for more social gameplay imo.  10 man can be cliqey
[5:24:55] Voidbonx: LUL
[5:25:01] jakmko: maybe 15 man is the sweet spot? theyve never done it!!!!
[5:25:01] fouriousjorge: Flexible raiding
[5:25:23] JimBobJr: only 10 man at level 50 too, hopefully bigger raids at 60 though
[5:25:35] dirbagdan: @NooleanB exactly. makes people get into a guild and make those relationships. I see that as positive. The queue culture is what ruined wrath
[5:25:56] Vunoka: ZG bis vanilla raid
[5:25:56] Zaziben: aggrend does premades and stomps noob
[5:26:04] coolcrazyguy72: 500 man raid
[5:26:08] ab66: is it the same guy that says these stuff?
[5:26:09] Cafe0le: i bet they would do 10 man raids in retail if the game didnt have so many specs, makes more sense in 2024
[5:26:09] NooleanB: @dirbagdan yep exactly, they killed the game with dungeon and raid finder, you'd think they'd learn their lesson
[5:26:26] jakmko: theres a warlock in your raid as we speak.. KICK HIM!
[5:26:57] numblezzz: remove dungeon/raid finder, ban gdkps
[5:26:59] TogaTig: ;)
[5:27:13] seksmuhchine: i think the lvl up raids shoud be 1daycd
[5:27:35] dirbagdan: @NooleanB They have learned their lesson. This is the sad part. People know those aspects ruined the game but they still want them for some reason. Its like people have been conditioned to fear socializing. Theres an anxiety to grouping so the masses want the queue syetem.
[5:27:37] conjonsilver: frogger king
[5:27:38] NooleanB: ;)
[5:27:43] yaro7i: Jesus dude amen!
[5:27:50] dirbagdan: @NooleanB So blizz keeps implementing them
[5:28:13] numblezzz: having to dodge actual mechanics? yeah very unfun for brain rotten boomers
[5:28:18] ScarfaceCEO: Not a good sign LUL
[5:28:36] indolent_sloth: Played pacman with murlocks
[5:28:47] jonisyntinen: @StaysafeTV What do you think why Germans came help Finland in continuation war when Stalin ruled CCCP? And why Stalin killed about 60 million of their own people?
[5:28:51] numblezzz: well thats just a caster issue
[5:28:58] MrHuntMeDown: agreed
[5:29:01] numblezzz: hence why i never play em
[5:29:04] jakmko: I kinda like that, its a totally new dps strat
[5:29:07] seksmuhchine: it's pretty much much UBRS but easier
[5:29:23] Lionkingler1: schizo poster KEKW
[5:29:25] dirbagdan: checks out
[5:29:26] jonisyntinen: @StaysafeTV YUP
[5:29:26] Farenheight451: is there boss worse than sindra in ICC @StaysafeTV
[5:29:29] doctorjoker12: stalin wasnt even russian
[5:29:37] aoe_enjoyer: quit stallin with the Powergum Madge
[5:29:39] dirbagdan: the holodomor
[5:29:40] numblezzz: stalin's industrialization of russia in the 30s saved the russian people from the evil germans COPIUM
[5:29:49] Cley145: stalin didn't even build an autobahn
[5:29:49] longsfellow1200: wasn't most of the CCCP run by the Jews?
[5:29:57] tosenj: Staysafe you got that same look in your eye as the homie oscar the grouch
[5:30:00] doctorjoker12: stalin was a schizo from georgia
[5:30:06] Lionkingler1: georgia boy
[5:30:16] Ghoulls_: whats your plan for leveling in phase 2
[5:30:21] Moshcall: Atlanta ga
[5:30:23] dirbagdan: actually though he's onto soemthing
[5:30:28] seksmuhchine: who talked about about staling weirdos
[5:30:36] Cafe0le: let them cook YEP
[5:30:37] Lionkingler1: 100% dungeon grind
[5:30:40] dirbagdan: you do kinda look like oscar
[5:30:41] JimBobJr: xp potions on blizzard store PogU
[5:30:43] Farenheight451: I thought when you left earlier i could hear digging under your floor @StaysafeTV just letting you know
