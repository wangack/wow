[4:01:13] Peter_Nincompoop: Cobalt, you've played a lot of WoW.  How does hardcore change the experience for you?
[4:01:41] StandardOut: You care now.
[4:01:52] StandardOut: Your first death is traumatic
[4:01:58] hatechatter: does hc change anything stats wise? or is it just permadeath
[4:01:58] KJTx: but what about all the leeroy jenkins moments D:
[4:02:01] VVumb0: like playing tainted lost
[4:02:02] kc5803: It's something special, for sure.

[4:02:24] StandardOut: You get to level 20 and you finally get into a new area and then boom... a Level 24 you didnt see in the trees comes at you.
[4:02:37] kc5803: You've got to pay attention to stuff you wouldn't otherwise
[4:02:39] Peter_Nincompoop: As a viewer, I really don't care about WoW.  But watching you guys play hardcore is actually fun .

[4:03:15] Gameboy736: they do hit hard
[4:04:16] Critstopher: probabl;y lost a duel
[4:04:16] StandardOut: Five Tauren warriors and got to 25+... each time. Said screw it Im playin Priest. HC is awesome.
[4:04:20] frozenbread_: Maybe death to mindcontrol?
[4:04:20] Critstopher: duels kill you
[4:04:23] Peter_Nincompoop: So PvP is live on the server?  Are people actually PvPing?
[4:04:58] frozenbread_: Yeah, looks like they have a generic 30yard
[4:06:10] kasjga: :D
[4:06:18] StandardOut: So you are getting 20 rep per pack. You need ~2000 more. That just 100 more. Its 10 sets of 10. Ez pz
[4:06:49] kc5803: so 20 sets of 5
[4:07:11] kc5803: so however long 1 set takes on average x 20 is how long it'll take
[4:07:15] StandardOut: Pull 10 packs take a break was my thought. but yes peaches and tomatos
[4:07:17] Peter_Nincompoop: I did a lot of AoE kiting with my wizard in EQ.  Those were the days.

[4:16:37] PaperbackWritter: farming rep @Radund01
[4:16:56] Gameboy736: 2 % drop rate for essence, so 1 every 50 mobs, so you should get a total of 8 on average when you have 3k rep
[4:18:06] Gameboy736: having 80 gold on top is better than not having it, right

I decided to wear my shoes on the wrong foot along with putting peanut butter inside them.  My feet now smell like rancid Reses's peanut butter cups.  I've also taken the liberty of taking an "ordinary" rock and eating it.  Wasn't that bad.  Would recommend with hot sauce.  Anybody else in chat come in here and be an individual COMPLETELY BAKED while watching Cobalt's streams?  Press 1 if yes.

[4:37:10] girlwithafatbeard: Joel
[4:38:03] EngeltheFallen: but all the warriors want to dps
[4:38:09] DetorioxDesign: Sounds about right warrior is best class after all
[4:40:02] xenthori_: im sure the non-tanks won't mind the pot that comes from 3 tank bidding war
[4:40:13] PaperbackWritter: luna hates mages that is why NODDERS
[4:41:23] Centurion_Havoc: pub raiding is so damn scary in HC
[4:43:00] PaperbackWritter: Meow
[4:45:00] Ap0c4lyptyc: Monkas
[4:45:33] biggoh: spooky
[4:46:35] PaperbackWritter: Sadge
[4:47:25] Coorsking3000: needs to be done
[4:47:28] lordcdm: Dew it
[4:47:30] BarbaricMonkey: Warrior alt is the true HC
[4:47:31] Coorsking3000: stay strong!
[4:47:47] BarbaricMonkey: Twinked out warrior feels so nice tho
[4:47:51] PhillyUrbs: only 328 kills to go until friendly
[4:48:04] PaperbackWritter: probably someone from fangsly
[4:48:07] EngeltheFallen: another warrior from a different guild
[4:48:10] EngeltheFallen: <.<
[4:48:10] PaperbackWritter: ayygord Madge
[4:48:17] BarbaricMonkey: the guy doing all the work
[4:48:21] Gameboy736: he goes to a different guild, you don't know him
[4:48:21] markthebo05: what are you farming for?
[4:48:31] EngeltheFallen: he is rep farming for mc attunement
[4:48:41] PhillyUrbs: he's from another guild.... you wouldn't know him
[4:48:50] PaperbackWritter: the 5th is a mage
[4:49:02] PaperbackWritter: garymage Sadge
[4:49:27] EngeltheFallen: curious if this server just dies when discovery comes out
[4:49:40] heyitsken_: not even close
[4:50:25] Coorsking3000: only like 325 more mobs and u go tthis
[4:51:16] Vanil78: sounds better if you say only 75 5 pack pulls?
[4:51:35] EngeltheFallen: for 33 10 pack pulls
[4:51:46] BarbaricMonkey: well if we say you do 5 mobs every minute then that means only 60ish mins
[4:51:49] heyitsken_: psssshhhhhhh
[4:52:01] heyitsken_: absolutely not
[4:52:41] cheduranga: WoW errrrday
[4:52:50] underscoreFishy: it's crazy to think this zone was 99% empty when molten core started. I'm guessin you had to grind rep mostly in MC itself then
[4:53:09] PaperbackWritter: they are going to do ubrs now
[4:53:23] cheduranga: usually people would get their rep through weeks of MC clears
[4:54:00] underscoreFishy: @cheduranga pretty much what I expected - I never got to MC content myself in vanilla until this was an option
[4:54:10] Gameboy736: according to a wiki I found, the rep quest wasn't even in the early phases of classic
[4:54:11] BarbaricMonkey: That's tight
[4:54:11] cheduranga: you mean if you got gud?
[4:54:19] HoppyOne: what are u farming these for?
[4:54:26] PhillyUrbs: @underscoreFishy i think these mobs were here when MC was released
[4:54:38] BarbaricMonkey: I always wanted 0.5 til I saw how many mats it required
[4:55:03] Ap0c4lyptyc: Did you tell them you wanted to dungeon lol?
[4:55:25] SushiLaser: i used to love doing BRD
[4:55:32] PaperbackWritter: yes LUL @Ap0c4lyptyc
[4:55:41] SushiLaser: but with how much we'd die in there idk if id wanna do it on hardcore lmao

[4:56:26] PhillyUrbs: i forgot about kazzak
[4:56:35] EngeltheFallen: kazzak was hilarious

[4:57:02] underscoreFishy: I could be wrong @PhillyUrbs but I know MC was long before the Silithus revamp - looks like patch 1.4 vs 1.8, but I didn't dig into which mobs came when.... I just remember exploring this plaace before 1.8 and it was EMPTY
[4:57:24] BarbaricMonkey: Ya Silithus was a wasteland before its patch
[4:57:40] EngeltheFallen: sith was pretty empty originally
[4:57:43] PhillyUrbs: i don't remember the version numbers. but i remember doing this farm way before a lot of people had the required rep

[4:57:49] EngeltheFallen: then AQ came and it started to populate
[4:58:09] underscoreFishy: yeah before 1.8 there was stuff near then entry from un'goro that's it iirc
[4:58:40] cheduranga: he‚Äôs a broke boy
[4:58:42] Gameboy736: 8 gold, almost as much as the essence
[4:58:46] cheduranga: when‚Äôs the next raid?
[4:59:05] BarbaricMonkey: Sometimes DM means DeadMines
[4:59:09] BarbaricMonkey: Sometimes it means DireMaul
[4:59:27] Gameboy736: sometimes it means daily mail
[4:59:55] cheduranga: more raids = more not getting items = more gold = getting gold and then getting the item cheaper next time
[5:00:47] EngeltheFallen: after attuning the core you done until you go in
