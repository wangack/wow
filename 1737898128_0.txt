[0:59:48] qithlorien: What’s ideally the fastest way to gear alts at 70?
[0:59:55] zeeAbe: Ion has not yet decided even what we will do with our crafted gear. Will we get new Sparks in season 2 or will we just upgrade our current gear etc. Find out in the next episode of World of Warcraft!

[1:05:52] sinlesssinner: well yea, when dps cant even kill orbs, or chain kill bursting... i aint Qing
[1:05:52] opalwinfrey: Yeah its miserable as a healer. I mostly heal raids which is why im 404
[1:05:56] rosina_scarlett: JB said how much he enjoyed Explosive then 30 mins later someone posted a clip of him bitching about explosive LUL
[1:06:00] asmodai4823: they need to give a reason for dps to hit explosives
[1:06:01] BrieannaMarie: @herzenliegen that's funny, I would think Halloween candy be out soon
[1:06:04] pk99: the lack affixes is kinda getting old
[1:06:11] biirrd: they need to change so explosive cant die, but makes a small dmg when they go off
[1:06:14] KinggKebab: Is that because of affixes though? or because of Hogwarts release tbf?
[1:06:30] Molvonos: Explosive's shit when you pull a big enough pack and the explosives get lost in the mobs
[1:06:39] Molvonos: And there's like 12 of them
[1:06:41] opalwinfrey: its bc of the explosions . its too much to keep up with and an easy wipe lol
[1:06:44] Herzenliegen: @BrieannaMarie honestly it wouldn't shock me if they did.
[1:06:49] michaelmm: Been crazy hard to get healers for my groups the last couple of days.
[1:06:57] abracka_: it would be a bit more bearable if we could still use target macros for explosives
[1:06:57] KaisenSiru: Hogwarts Pog
[1:07:00] mavericks312: This man said hog warts lmao
[1:07:01] DeveKr: Who gives a rats ass about hogwarts? WTF
[1:07:02] epyonk: lol
[1:07:03] rosina_scarlett: I was doing keys on my sub rogue.. and every 11-14 keys I did, I was doing 75% of the explosive with r druids xD
[1:07:07] darkkilla1: bursting keeps its interesting as a healer if you don't have a MD

[1:07:27] Whiskey_Corin: Pass the dutchie on the left hand side
[1:07:33] rosina_scarlett: see the biggest issue with Explosive.. is they upped the HP of them there not 1 anymore
[1:07:42] mattgolds: pass it
[1:07:45] darkkilla1: mouse over
[1:07:49] darkkilla1: you cant even tab target it
[1:07:51] tempestmemes: mouseover
[1:07:56] Inthezonewow: How do you do it now? I don't KEKW
[1:07:56] mavericks312: Or allow the explosives to be cleavable
[1:07:57] pk99: plater profile removes all healthbars when explosives are up
[1:07:59] zeeAbe: I wonder how many healers refuse to play on explosive weeks just because the common mentality is that "healer deal with that shit"
[1:07:59] asmodai4823: nah there should be a dps boost for killing explosives that way everyone in group wants to kill them
[1:08:02] flebbooo: i mouseover my crackling jade as mw
[1:08:03] Revelations45: Just hanging out man @Towelliee getting all my crap moved over to the girls house today

[1:08:28] s7wede: you can tab target, but the chance of you doing it in a big pack is minute.
[1:08:35] Aquadriel: theres a weak aura that makes explosive's nameplate super big and is easy to tab target. makes it easy for healers.
[1:08:46] rosina_scarlett: I think they just need to put explosives back to 1 hp it takes 3 DH throw glaives to kill them
[1:08:58] Aquadriel: But yeah when group is "big pull" and they expect me as heal to deal with all explosions, i tell em to fuck off KEKW

[1:09:51] lauvlywow: @Aquadriel There's also a WA to allow you to toggle showing/hiding all nameplates but exlosives. Therefore, you just toggle -> click explosive -> untoggle
[1:09:56] flebbooo: volcanic best affix, it doesn't exist for melee
[1:10:12] darkkilla1: they could just CC the spiteful.
[1:10:12] s7wede: I think explosive should be changed to 1 per pack that scales with the number of mobs still alive. Make the cast slightly longer and give it an absorb shield that scales with nearby mob HP%
[1:10:18] zeeAbe: You do the BIGGEST pull

[2:02:35] hammack52: no
[2:02:38] WeedFranck: Yes Valor is uncapped but we still need to reach Mythic Score for level 7 to 13 (level 7 is 600- level 8&9 1000- level 10 1400- level 11 1700- level 12 2000- and level 13 2400- M

[2:04:24] darkkilla1: disc pumps they just require a team to be slightly more coordinated then a standard pug
[2:04:25] PvtHudson093: bear is now a paper bagger
[2:04:57] Yagr6: is it dmg issue or survival issue?
[2:05:03] rhaggs4: Colts officially hired Steichen
[2:05:12] WeedFranck: So basicly, valor uncapped but for upgrading 398 to 415 we still need to reach M+ score to be able to upgrade further (405 is 1400, 408 is 1700, 411 is 2000 and 415 is 2400 rating) majority of people still have lot to do... like me
[2:05:14] asmodai4823: bear is shit vs magic dmg

[2:26:13] rosina_scarlett: @DendViid explosive doesn't have 1 hp anymore
[2:26:16] ohnot___her: Havoc is one shot. vDH is a bug that’s been known for awhile.

[2:34:13] captain_khyzan: halls, bracken, ulda all gonna be ass in that order for sure
[2:34:22] Molvonos: Seasonal Affix is going to be 'Fuck you in particular' and you just randomly take 70% of your hp pool.  And it'll still be better than Thundering.
[2:34:26] lazarus_ttv: They need to reduce trash count and put in a seasonal affix like BfA season 4
[2:34:28] shortyforthewin: will you do any lost ark later on
[2:34:30] Mecabeast: accept the shard trinket ftom infusion will replace puzzle box

[2:36:07] theDirtyon3: just NEVER take a hunter to underrot
[2:36:08] magemaster225: underrot was only good with the last season affix
[2:36:16] iDeez88: @Anneriaa we dont need it again
[2:36:20] Foretoldlegends: Just give the adds more health in Maw of Souls and remove a specific game breaking item from the loot pool. Problem solved.
[2:36:20] Eviltuna13: We need some classic ones as Mythic+ would love to see SM updated
[2:36:31] shaydaan_tn: everbloom will come back and be a shitfest
[2:36:34] iDeez88: Deadmines M+
[2:36:36] CEK_kingdom: season 2 is going to be a shitstorm for M+
[2:36:45] Polarisss_: MoP was 10 years ago... that's a scary thought
[2:36:49] Faudo: Dire Maul M+ :)
[2:36:58] chriswrites: is BFA out of the picture? is it too soon?
[2:37:02] Subspherical: Honestly kind of like it
[2:37:11] protocols_: Can u go over Raz nerfs?
[2:37:11] rosina_scarlett: @chriswrites nah
[2:37:14] Sazuret: Pulled two great trinkets from my alts boxes and got poop on my main LUL
[2:37:16] shaydaan_tn: i like the split
[2:37:16] reggiepowa: I kinda like every single shadowlands dungeon more than df dungeons
[2:37:24] dracullus: @Faudo they said over and over again earliest dungeon they pick is from MoP era
[2:37:25] derry10: what other dungeon for MoP would you want to see?
[2:37:27] JFeezy__: We lookin at Raz nerfs quick?
[2:37:28] Phobiums: the froglets in halls of infusion will be the death of all groups
[2:37:43] Caloz7: the dungeons in this expac are good its just that theres too much spell bloat
[2:37:43] shaydaan_tn: but just think they left the 4 most terribble for season 2
[2:37:52] shaydaan_tn: maybe mix it differently later on
[2:37:58] Omni35: flying in a dungeon was a bold choice
[2:37:58] tracersky: !rio
[2:38:02] Moskeebee: every "Halls" dungeon in the game LUL like the meme
[2:38:04] shaydaan_tn: storming

[2:38:14] Deusey: They all just seem long
[2:38:16] chriswrites: i would love a Return to Kara Mythic +. Those were super fun in Legon
[2:38:23] rosina_scarlett: ulduman has that dope trinket as well
[2:38:27] Sollice: First season should be all 8 expansion dungeons. Then season 2 3 4 etc should rotate 2 2 2 2 from new back expansion ( skipping the expansion right before current )
[2:38:28] uhhhhyeayoo: You gotta remember though, the current DF dungeon underwent loads of tuning. If stuff is tuned well the season 2 DF dungeons could be better honestly
[2:38:31] Nebulizer87: Honestly Dragonflight dungeons are probably the weakest feature of DF
[2:38:33] Allvarez: nelth looks so sick
[2:38:38] totemdropa: Deadlines m+
[2:38:39] Tinit5190: I'm only worried about Brakenhide %
[2:38:43] Sazuret: @chriswrites We had those last season, hell no to that again KEKW
[2:38:52] CEK_kingdom: idk what it is about Nel, i just find it so boring
[2:38:59] james_bah: legion had best m+ dungeons
[2:38:59] chriswrites: KEKW
[2:39:03] ElmSpace: Neltharus is probably the best of the "new" dungeons next season
[2:39:03] theDirtyon3: its just soooo big though
[2:39:09] shaydaan_tn: because nel is like a raid
[2:39:10] shaydaan_tn: long af
[2:39:11] KrakonSkullz: this expansion is kinda wack
[2:39:13] rosina_scarlett: Ulduman will be the most run M+ DF dungeon in S2 for the dps trinket
[2:39:14] dracullus: @chriswrites won't happen, they were M+ just season ago, at the end of SL
[2:39:17] Cheapesttactics1: did they say what dungeons are next for the next season?
[2:39:25] Nebulizer87: The next set are all long and we’re super unfavored they need to stop trying to make everything giga hard

[2:40:03] CEK_kingdom: @shaydaan_tn so true
[2:40:05] magemaster225: mages using 372 claw trinket means next season it will be busted

[3:17:30] JFeezy__: tis not bug... is feature
[3:17:33] BaldNed: Prefer that over not enough trash spawning before the boss
[3:17:35] PvtHudson093: did anyone clip it?
[3:17:42] GingerGambit: Yes they changed how the birds come in and they still can bug
[3:17:48] Molvonos: https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousPerfectSardinePeanutButterJellyTime-7tRwcE1kOO4jqSA7

[3:19:19] Awikan: Just gotta make sure everyone doesnt hearth out at the same time ect
[3:19:21] Masqerader: watching council on lfr is top tier,  all those rats with their herpes spreading it
[3:19:42] JFeezy__: @tyler2112 that's because the collective IQ of the raid team in lfr is comparable to that of a muddy shoe
[3:19:58] Allvarez: its never aliens, ban that guy
[3:20:39] Korupcija_: not enough swirrlies tbh
[3:20:51] rollcalling: can confirm. dk master class

[3:23:14] 1337RAIDS: as a fellow tank, no one has beaten me on explosives =P
[3:23:14] kowaikokoro: praise the lord
[3:23:23] 1337RAIDS: not even hunters
[3:23:28] realtree502: @Midnight_1666 what is it?
[3:23:32] Allvarez: explosive could be so much better
[3:23:34] Exodeo_: wish they'd just get rid of explosives
[3:23:41] nadidadi: i mean if they got more health

[3:26:44] Masqerader: my favorite Rag moment was when a shaman in DOS kept thinking the big blue circle on the way to Hakkar was a soak mechanic, got mad and quit the dungeon when people kept running from him
[3:26:46] ItsIceCool: wow is just a toxic wasteland
[3:26:48] Allvarez: i left a 15 cos bc dps couldnt interrupt for shit, went and did a +2 17 cos with competent ppl

[3:27:46] oRiie: F1 is awesome; watch Drive to Survive on netflix to catchup/learn the scene a little
[3:27:51] Foretoldlegends: @Allvarez Trust me when I say this. If a lot of WoW players see the interrupt as an optional talent point, they won't go for it. I've had plenty of mythic keys where I've had to yell at dps to interrupt stuff.
[3:28:04] BAMFBreakers: were actually gonna have a couple cheap nascar breaks this week @Towelliee 2 Prizm + 1 Chron

[4:17:47] BrutalBlueberry: Blood DK needs tweaked in several ways
[4:17:49] Epixil: did towel get the love rocket?
[4:17:50] Puccett: warrior tanks are rocks lol
[4:17:54] GingerGambit: Feel like a lot of people are bored of warrior
[4:18:00] shrektard69: how did the vault go @Towelliee
[4:18:06] Thoreya: m+ is feral or unholy
[4:18:08] theDirtyon3: Shadow FUCKS right now
[4:18:09] Thoreya: idk about raid
[4:18:11] FrankTizzle: WoWhead has Spriest being best performer at 95% percentile @Towelliee
[4:18:13] QlecGaming: they do have an 18 dps rotation thou
[4:18:27] Mecabeast: ik I have issues pulling off bdk and bears in m+ during my opening burst as a dps
[4:18:40] theDirtyon3: Shadow is 5Head though yeah
[4:18:42] GingerGambit: Even the last boss can change what you need
[4:18:54] Nokterian: I'm loving MW and there getting better each patch and hotfix with the new patch 10.0.7 a new talent will be added
[4:18:54] mozart69_420: @Towelliee hopefully new tank cclass
[4:19:26] im_capy: LUL
[4:19:31] FrankTizzle: They need to add a ranged tank option that wears cloth
[4:19:35] BrutalBlueberry: DKs have the problem where everyone else has been getting steady buffs, so they are being left behind
[4:19:38] shrektard69: how did the vault go @Towelliee
[4:19:47] Mecabeast: I want a mail tank class and a ranged plate class
[4:19:47] zeeAbe: To be honest, the best time to introduce a new spec would be in the middle of a tier if you are doing it mid expansion
[4:19:54] Crizzle777: how am I supposed to get sparks now?
[4:19:56] DunzoCD: evoker tank LUL
[4:20:07] flebbooo: @Nokterian MW is sooo fun rn! its great seeing blizz giving them love
[4:20:10] ialwaysforget7: just got spark woot
[4:20:10] procyon_mfc: servers back up?
[4:20:23] Raxxiety: nope
[4:20:25] mozart69_420: i just keep imagining a dk lock tank hybrid class
[4:20:28] seangang: LUL
[4:20:57] shrektard69: lol no shot
[4:21:11] QlecGaming: would be nice with a tank class where it was a pet tanking
[4:21:13] abe4th: I think the black dragonflight makes a ton of sense for a evoker tank but it would take a long time to figure out
[4:21:22] ThejukeFox: That would be sick, if they add a big dragon tank form
[4:21:25] GingerGambit: Last time I did lfr Raz, I had to shift the groups 10 15 because the other side couldn’t kill the adds and we still beat them
[4:21:38] propoopimus: evoker tank 10.1
[4:21:46] DunzoCD: it would be nice if the 2 spec classes got another spec to play with like DH
[4:21:59] im_capy: Blizz gonna wear them out hopefully
[4:22:14] Mecabeast: also dh needs to get either a 3rd spec or the ability to use polearms/staffs
[4:22:20] Nokterian: MW getting a new talent in 10.0.7 that will Sheilun's Gift healing from 3 to 5 people and lower the cast time by 0.5 seconds.
[4:22:27] DunzoCD: it wouldnt be hard to use the D3 demon hunter as a base for a 3rd more ranged spec
[4:22:29] nimbus420i: top 1%er dont matter tbh
[4:22:38] nimbus420i: if casuals quit game will be dead
[4:22:40] zeiours: do you think the world first race would become worst of better if it became a official blizzard event @towelliee
[4:23:06] shrektard69: for sure
[4:23:06] Thoreya: it does
[4:23:11] Thoreya: the quarterly reporrt  said it
[4:23:12] theDirtyon3: 100%
[4:23:14] im_capy: exactly, hardcore players will be there still, casuals just get pushed away if you cater to the 1%
[4:23:15] Thoreya: better than past expansions
[4:23:15] flebbooo: yh more than likely
[4:23:20] flebbooo: it feels more alive
[4:23:37] kuggerkug: sub retention is higher because the swolloc mount is super cool
[4:23:39] FrankTizzle: Casuals have a reason to stay subbed since they have gear progression, imagine that Kappa
[4:23:41] Velanthos: its mjust a climb back to people trusting after the last 2 expacs
[4:23:50] GingerGambit: The campaign in SL just dragged on and on
[4:23:59] Daarksyde: i say this everytime.... Blizzard does not owe anyone anything!!!
[4:24:00] TitaniumPrime7: as a casual, i definitely have played DF more than BFA or SL till this point
[4:24:23] BoogieDuck: LOL!

[4:24:33] juicefermilk: bc was my most played expansion lmao
[4:24:45] noah16hallmark: couldnt agree more
[4:24:51] Baldarsar: fuck the world first shit anyway
[4:24:56] Thoreya: and we can restream ittttt on twtich
[4:24:59] im_capy: Blizz is just doing a better job overall now, its night and day with DF Vs SL

[4:28:56] dreamwalker213: You can switch comps after every dinfeon

[4:54:56] Boggogroggo: He's going to consume the other 2

[4:55:58] iDeez88: ok bud ^
[4:56:06] shrektard69: interesting
[4:56:11] NewWorldReign: Yeah, didnt Deathwings son experiment with a dragon to put all aspects into one being?
[4:56:36] Troniin: if he is unkillable, how are we gonna fight him?
[4:56:37] xo_navi: galakrond has to be the final boss right?
[4:56:40] rollcalling: Chromagus wasn't in BWL?
[4:56:50] seangang: Tiamat :O
[4:56:53] shrektard69: looks a bit goofy imo
[4:56:53] Sylphy_TV: AH! Hydra
[4:56:53] Amerra: wait is there 5 dragon heads?
[4:56:58] NewWorldReign: Deathwings hidden son.

[4:57:12] chefdejour82: Chromatus
[4:57:13] xo_navi: chromatus not chromagus
[4:57:16] DannyG757: would be dope af
[4:57:17] Malarick: King Ghidora on steroids
[4:57:18] xo_navi: they sound exactly the same tho LUL
[4:57:24] GroovyBryan: could still be the end boss
[4:57:25] Mecabeast: maybe it'll have an upgraded mechanics of the chromaggus fight in bwl?
[4:57:26] NewWorldReign: Thats King fuckin Ghorida from Godzilla (sp?)
[4:57:26] xghostyyx: The red headed step child of the aspects
[4:57:29] Boggogroggo: they're gonna come out with a white dragon aspect XD

[4:58:32] xo_navi: galakrond may be a stretch tho
[4:58:40] valianya: Ohhh to empower the Aspects they need to drain Chromatus would be cool
[4:58:41] xFinerx: Probabaly gonna use the time dragons to fight him
[4:58:47] QlecGaming: You think its gonna be a body type 1 or 2 ? :p
[4:58:53] xo_navi: jailer comes back riding galakrong
[4:58:59] NewWorldReign: Now I understand why Raz tried to destroy that tower in Azure Span, Chromatus HAS to be in that!
[4:59:04] chriswrites: @Towelliee bro this shit sucks. im ilvl 402 getting declined for +2s
[4:59:06] GroovyBryan: Kaelthas was dead dead, soooo. lol
[4:59:09] Inthezonewow: @Towelliee Could involve necromancers, apparently Galakrond's bones have moved from Dragonblight
[4:59:19] redtemplar88: I wish they saved Nefarius for this expac. Seeing him and Wrathion interact would have been awesome.
[4:59:24] rollcalling: O.o thats how Noruzond is saved....by putting his essence into chromatus
[4:59:28] largefromage: dead=not dead. dead dead=prbly dead
[4:59:33] xo_navi: LUL

[5:00:17] rollcalling: i want to see the return of Illidan and Argus

[5:02:22] Club_Tuna: @towelliee have you ever heard of Neebs gaming?
[5:02:25] nimbus420i: toxic
[5:02:28] BrutalBlueberry: But didnt they seal it somewhere, and they forgot the Dragon Isles existed? So they didnt seal it in Forbidden Reach
[5:02:30] nimbus420i: KEKW
[5:02:35] thewillem: Nemesees
[5:02:42] DunzoCD: @Yenroz no argus was legion

[5:03:41] Club_Tuna: Content creator passed away

[5:04:40] gassygatinho: that was awful man
[5:04:48] gassygatinho: nathria was bis

[5:06:46] Karbonn: I played the F out of D2, but D3 was a let down... played at launch but not for long.
[5:06:51] Chronine: @Havoc_S1 weird comment
[5:06:54] kokochris: nice subathon
[5:07:00] DunzoCD: i just hope they took notes from PoE spawning from D2 and go closer to their D2 systems
[5:07:00] Yenroz: I kinda lost all hope for D4 when i played the beta and they announced the release date so close to the beta ^^
[5:07:14] warrenny: Micro transactions happen🤷🏻‍♂️

[5:07:42] dramallama85: @Towelliee what was the mount that you were on?
[5:07:43] Amerra: @warrenny I think Blizzard knows they can't micro transaction the hell out of D4 without it failing.
[5:07:45] 91Niki: @Yenroz You do know that betas are usually older builds, right?
[5:07:54] kokochris: @Yenroz danSmug
[5:08:09] abracka_: i have manic grieftorch and horn of valor in my vault, FUCK

I wont be playing on launch cause of it. But generally i hope its good. 1 thing that was amazing in the beta tho was the scenery/art
[5:10:43] Amerra: ^^^ Maybe I'm thinking of that.
[5:10:44] gassygatinho: how are death jesters doing
[5:10:49] Jaren475: where's the timewalking vendor?

[5:10:56] theDirtyon3: theres a community but noone really uses it
[5:10:57] abracka_: @warrenny for BM, it's just manic. but MM could go either way. i might just take grieftorch for m+ w BM
[5:10:57] xghostyyx: Im 1/30th there :D
[5:11:05] TheYosim: if only we could all pool our points for the guild perk

[5:14:14] xghostyyx: they crutch i say "new tech" hahaha
[5:14:15] 91Niki: @Yenroz Sounds to me you're a little out of the loop of how betas like that work. But it's fair if you wanna play it safe. Just know the D4 beta was PURELY endgame mechanics testing. Not in depth tuning and such as Wow betas/ptr. So take bugs and unlikable things with a grain of salt.
[5:14:19] atsq1: Is this an easier week then last?

[5:16:31] xo_navi: but you can play with 60 fine it's not a shooter
[5:16:32] rosina_scarlett: @Yenroz anything past the main story is considered end game
[5:17:25] Yenroz: it wasnt "end game" as you had to be a certain lvl to unlock most of the "endgame" so most of the time you just grinded waht you could to reach the "endgame". It would basicly saying normal dungeons in wow is endgame. For me thats m+ and raiding ^^
[5:17:31] JGussey: just did a 8 min +3 SMB lol
[5:17:45] Plague_GG: Ppl are saying blizzard forgot to enable cross realm mythic

[5:18:44] 91Niki: @Yenroz Again, that is END GAME aka post story. Just because you are level 1 doesn't make it any less end game. They are testing adventure mode which is unlocked after you finish story, and therefor end game ;)

[5:19:08] dreamwalker213: My alts gonna get juiced

[5:19:49] kreloril777: 406 ret pali, cant even get into a +2
[5:19:52] shrektard69: enhance!

[5:22:50] rollcalling: cuz i have pulled all this trash into the courtyard and had the fear and dark claw hit me thru the walls
[5:23:00] Tubflow: or do i need to hit 2500 on all my toons
[5:23:25] Yenroz: @DunzoCD that wasnt my issue with it tho. Like there is dungeon keys for harder mode dungeons. That took a long time and most people didnt even get to it during the beta and the harder mode dungeons are considered end game content what you do on max lvl etc. 1 thing iam worried about for the dungeon part is that they were much the same just different layouts. Like same bosses etc. I hope that changes for release.
[5:24:52] dreamwalker213: @tubflow still need 2400
[5:25:22] 91Niki: @DunzoCD Yeah, that's cuz they are testing. They won't show you everything. I don't think you really understand what beta testing means. You aren't looking at the full game. It's a testing created environment. The devs will only include what they want you to test. Not everything
[5:26:26] Weedweed: whats up big dog
[5:27:06] Morhig: Just opened the vault to 421 tier chest and a 20AA key.... decent outcome
[5:27:18] 91Niki: @Morhig Grats :D
[5:27:27] Inthezonewow: What score is KSM this season? 2K?
[5:27:29] DunzoCD: @Yenroz have you played PoE? that sounds alot like their endgame which is very popular, and getting to T16 maps and uber bosses takes a long time so if its similar it might not be as bad as you think
[5:28:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: towChad towChad towChad
[5:28:07] Amerra: @Inthezonewow yep 2k
[5:28:09] PvtHudson093: i hate this trash pack
[5:28:21] iDeez88: I'm new, was this trash this awful in orginal, or is it overtuned for m+
[5:28:42] Yenroz: Can you please stop saying i dont know what a beta is. ive played multiple so far. What makes me worried is to see that i did 40 different dungeons with a tottal of 3 different bosses and then hear teh game will release 4-5 months later thats really worrying to me. but ill just drop the discussion now unless people wants to continue with it ^^
[5:28:44] Slowtwitch: dark claw is magic dmg yea?
[5:28:44] Amerra: That trash pack is basically the entire dungeon LUL
[5:28:56] noah16hallmark: no theres more
[5:28:57] Uutef: you can skip
[5:29:03] NoWaayMan: ya this pack is awful. you get your hopes up on your time and then wipe 4 times lol
[5:29:04] Uutef: and pull the side
[5:29:05] noah16hallmark: 3 extra adds after that boss
[5:29:47] 91Niki: @Yenroz Doesn't mean you know how it works just cuz you've been in multiple ;) but alright. I am sure the release will prove you wrong... or maybe Diablo 4 just isn't for you :D

[5:33:03] Amerra: AV is DEFINATELY a trap
