[0:49:42] gfield2k: I’m never bet against Mahomes or Brady. They kill teams in the last 2 minutes of games. If you not beating them 14 or more
[0:50:04] Wulfgrym: mahomes is a great qb
[0:50:09] Outerlaw: bday suit towelliee variant
[0:50:13] Wulfgrym: his greatness is going to get curbed when kelce retires
[0:50:20] Wulfgrym: unless tehy find him another clutch receiver
[0:50:26] vodkablaq: HOW bout them Chieeeeffs.
[0:50:54] Pups_Gersky: Rice is gonna be his new go to over the years. He's been stepping up.
[0:51:22] Wulfgrym: yeah i got a stock of his rc's saved up
[0:51:30] Wulfgrym: but needs a te that can do what  kelce does

[0:51:49] falldrgn: now the internet is shaming  travis, because he of what happened w/ Coash Reid.  Apparently you can't show emotion?
[0:51:56] im_capy: They can recruit one still, "wanna win a SB?"
[0:52:12] Wulfgrym: well imo, you don't do that to your coach
[0:52:12] SamuraiWillZ916: mahomes doing all that intentional grounding was hilarious lol
[0:52:16] im_capy: NE did similar
[0:52:57] Pups_Gersky: yea no Rice is away too small to be a TE.
[0:53:21] Wulfgrym: mahomes and kelce got a great synergy not that easy to replace, but kelce is 34? so his clock is ticking down
[0:53:52] neftario105: Jordan or Lebron?
[0:53:55] Vondrex: T.O. should emotion
[0:54:04] im_capy: No TE will fill his shoes the same, but at least Mahome isnt a rookie anymore either
[0:54:10] Wulfgrym: whether i like him or not mahomes does find way to win
[0:54:54] im_capy: Wasnt a Brady fan, not a Mahome fan, but gotta call it as a i see it, some people just know how to win
[0:55:06] geokouts: Our Boy Karlaftis got it twice in a row :)
[0:55:15] paulson14: Mahomes will make their future TE look good. No one will replace Kelce but they will be fine.
[0:55:18] Pups_Gersky: That touchdown to McKinnon was all Andy Reid's play.
[0:55:34] paulson14: Might shift if Andy reid retires.
[0:56:46] falldrgn: @Wulfgrym You are 100% right. Do I think he intended to bump him? nah..
[0:56:46] im_capy: Got a soft spot for Andy as a Packers fan, always will
[0:56:52] mitchumtx: LOL, apparently a few 49ers were not aware of the new OT Rules

[0:59:38] Darthyrevan: how was it before?
[1:00:22] Pups_Gersky: the new OT rules are more fair cause most times the receiving team will move the ball into FG range and win. Now both team have a fair shot. Only rule is if a Defensive TD happens then its over.

[1:02:01] paulson14: @DirtyBeef2134 i was a sore loser last year.
[1:02:06] aspiration89: From someone who isn't a fan of either time, it did seem good from a call perspective
[1:02:07] geokouts: Big MF RIgss!!!
[1:02:12] Alcaeus_: we gonna talk about that dragon?
[1:02:14] im_capy: considering it was mostly a defensive game, it finished with a offensive bang
[1:02:20] DirtyBeef2134: @Sollice that's whining. Why bring that up? why blow up the coaching staff with those statements
[1:02:21] Pups_Gersky: Clean calls from what I saw. But ol boy trying to should block Kelce and being taken out the game. Oooouch.
[1:02:28] DirtyBeef2134: @paulson14 same. #FLYeaglesFLY
[1:02:30] Pups_Gersky: *shoulder

[1:03:02] Sollice: You called them sore losers. I don't think they were whinning they just didnt know
[1:03:12] geokouts: no Benny Hill theme song?
[1:03:15] Sollice: And if your not trained on something you have to do...it's the trainers fault lol
[1:03:54] Wulfgrym: @DirtyBeef2134 you a chiefs fan?
[1:04:00] DirtyBeef2134: your life revolves around the game. If you don't know the rules. It's your fault. It's also the coaches fault for not bringing it up if that's true
[1:04:10] im_capy: injected them salts, dude was everywhere
[1:04:15] DirtyBeef2134: @Wulfgrym hell no. Eagles

[1:29:12] cta62: @Towelliee first 4 bosses not bad next two require coordination
[1:29:53] cta62: 5th boss very doable I am proud of how they made the last boss involved for a classic raid
[1:30:00] cta62: makes me excited for more challenging content
[1:30:28] Mayern: after raiding  gnomer, the future looks bright for raiding in sod Pog
[1:30:46] cta62: if u like mechanics and challenging raids yes it is
[1:30:51] TakeThatBack: You think they should add normal/heroic versions in SoD to feed both groups of ppl?
[1:30:55] cta62: cant wait to see what the next one is like
[1:31:06] cta62: no
[1:31:11] cta62: absolutely no
[1:31:22] TakeThatBack: I havent touched SoD yet, just curious
[1:31:26] cta62: challenging content is fine they struck a good balance in gnomer it isnt face roll
[1:31:29] cta62: but it isnt easy
[1:31:37] Wcvechten: just give SOD mythic jailer at the end and it'll keep the server progging forever, ez
[1:31:44] Ordogg: There needs to be a difference or your just playing the same game with a different skin
[1:31:50] popzagon: SoD is fun because theres no challenge! its relaxing
[1:31:52] cta62: its not so easy that it is boring but not so hard that it feels impossible
[1:32:30] im_capy: Grinding the later levels already kills off a large part of the player base, no need to make raids help speed that up
[1:32:42] Mayern: Gnomer was not super HARD, but a bit of challenge to learn the fight. 5-10 pulls maybe and thats awesome
[1:32:45] cta62: @Towelliee botcades amiright lul
[1:33:06] cta62: @Mayern exactly
[1:33:13] cta62: think the balance of difficulty was perfect
[1:33:39] im_capy: Ya, the couldve shut down SoM 2 months in and no one wouldve noticed it was that dead
[1:33:59] cta62: @Towelliee god dont remind me of the yeti horn quest in winterspring
[1:34:02] akacvrtops: so is gnomer lvl 40 now 10 man?
[1:34:03] Chester994: PVP is really good in SOD
[1:34:20] Wulfgrym: yeah when u get to 60 and you got like 4 raids to run weekly its going to be tedious

[1:44:17] geokouts: is it chain from defeted the final boss of RFK?
[1:44:42] KShellZx: that missed extra point was brutal
[1:44:52] jman03: That was the worst display of Super Bowl level football.
[1:44:58] JaeDee: In OT they just let Pat run up the middle for 1st downs..
[1:45:06] im_capy: that 6 yard loss made him lose a few years
[1:45:11] Bloodhaven08: Butker the real MVP
[1:45:14] Wulfgrym: championships are battles of inches, one wrong thing and you lose or win
[1:45:19] b_lappy: he kicked it right at the dline, only missed PAT of the season, crazy
[1:45:26] DemonicAngel318: Hey @towelliee , who has the SoD specific WAs you're using?
[1:45:29] brewgamingtv: the extra point block was a big point

[1:45:41] Bowwjack: @Towelliee 1
[1:45:42] Bloodhaven08: 2 for 4 yards
[1:45:45] brewgamingtv: 1
[1:46:24] Bowwjack: @Towelliee they are going to rework patricks contract and probably make some moves in the offseason
[1:46:29] brewgamingtv: should of been lions vs chiefs. if lions didn't shoot themselves in the foot in 2nd half
[1:46:33] Wulfgrym: personally i don't see it happening, gotta have the ultimate luck in football to be able to get to the superbowl and have your team healthy year after year
[1:46:48] MattyNiceTV: Chief's Secondary is crazy
[1:47:11] Bloodhaven08: na we didnt do takeways
[1:47:15] sircheex: Its not impossible but the AFC is getting better as a whole.
[1:47:16] brewgamingtv: @Bowwjack where do u get hat info?

[1:48:04] Bloodhaven08: Karlaftis was great
[1:48:26] brewgamingtv: @Bowwjack the rework cuz there was no talk ever of a rework on his contract
[1:48:37] sircheex: 49ers are so screwed with contracts too
[1:48:51] NetherRegion: 2nd time 49ers lost to the Chiefs in the SB with a 10 pt lead.
[1:49:01] sircheex: Lots of people to pay
[1:49:05] Pups_Gersky: that trick play by 9ers was pretty good call and theyscored.
[1:49:15] instant_savage: yeah and the texans are gonna sign chris jones

[5:25:56] jarilrpg: this a council fight? like they all need to die together?
[5:26:11] Aidler: what’s that? A rooster, a squirrel, a sheep and a whelpling dragon? 😳
[5:27:17] Robmit: Overheat is casted by the Dragon, if any other bosses are near the dragon when overheat goes off, it will ignite them and give them a 15 second aura that deals damage
[5:27:24] TheRonWeedsley: di cooldown doesnt reset
[5:27:54] Robmit: you can stack the dragon, but move the chicken and squirrel away from dragon during cast
[5:28:52] Robmit: The dragon plants its feet during the cast so only the 2 other bosses can be moved away
