[1:41:58] starkos7: :O i often dream about sucking cock, might i be gay???? :O
[1:41:58] Folive: Is that because in Cataclysm you can become an actual troll druid and you don't have to continuously just drink their blood
[1:41:59] Krodo_Baggins: !fursona

[1:42:13] YDjo: cata was my first real exp i started playing late wotlk FeelsStrongMan
[1:42:14] PocketWookiee: @Krad_lord i mean in the start the energy tick did work like classic so it is technically wrong to have it in this early (if you go with spirits of the game)
[1:42:15] limit_test: Feral were probably strong LUL
[1:42:16] trainwreck4343: ok these 3 "new" guys are gamers. nice
[1:42:17] SoulessSiren666: when does Classic become Retail??  Like....when is the Classic expansions done?
[1:42:18] Razorclaws: @embrs Yes I did the same, I was tank as main and feral as off spec. But you said something about druids not powershifting and I was trying to say that is wrong, not that feral is good/viable
[1:42:19] daLuhz: @sodapoppin why is it called whaling caverns if theres no whales
[1:42:20] Bboy_420: wotlk+ would be amazing, with bunch of new stuff
[1:42:23] klig7: kinda crazy that WoD was one before Legion but it feels like it was so much earlier
[1:42:24] janaparks: @BWV861 legion made me come back to wow
[1:42:24] RedinkAddicted: Legion is the best!!
[1:42:26] cocoamaestro: GOD I can't wait for WotLK to cost me $150 dollars for a unique mount and armor set to gain an additional 10% xp while leveling and get /spit on :)

[1:43:51] Vanwinkles: @RaymonNL a new MMO that hits anywhere near everyone's nostalgic concept of an MMO is going to be impossible. Let alone a decent, new, MMO.
