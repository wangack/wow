[0:03:50] doouguk: bartender i guess
[0:04:17] Mejafo: morn'n all

[0:05:27] polarbearchef: this jam reminds me of Subnautica
[0:05:28] MachoCham: Is it due to having the two bars always visible on the right hand side?

[0:06:15] tnhorrorfan: chubohJams
[0:06:27] tnhorrorfan: morning
[0:07:01] MachoCham: There is BlizzMove I believe it's called to allow you to move unmovable blizzard elements which may do it? I think Dan's is just due to him having a smaller UI scale maybe?
[0:07:15] polarbearchef: oh shit wait it's a star wars remix!
[0:08:08] DeveKr: Yeah, i could use blizz move or move anything, but i want blizz to fix their oversight and I am holding my breath until they do. ;)

[0:17:56] MachoCham: <3 Turet
[0:18:04] Xelcion: 7 hours?! dayum
[0:18:06] JohnAlterat: no, 50% exp as before. Chromie changes will be on 16 nov.
[0:18:12] Xelcion: SO leveling is generally slower?
[0:18:30] Siegdjffermin: 1 raiders from Siegdjffermin have joined! 
[0:18:32] MachoCham: I did to 48 with the buff on retail in 6 1/2
[0:18:40] JohnAlterat: un 30 lvl there was decreasing lvlgaining speed, after 30 - much faster as now
[0:18:42] Xelcion: So shadowlands are being cast to the well.. Shadowlands?
[0:18:43] Luis_as99: what will you main in dragonflight?
[0:18:51] emarol_dk: im level 35 in retail, on a allied race, 7 hours and 18 min

[0:19:08] AJ_Zen: what are the chances that a casual player has 405 ilvl in dragonflight?
[0:19:12] StreamElements: Crafting Order System - Complete Overview | Dragonflight Beta - https://youtu.be/AK6T47GnQT8
[0:19:13] Zantex0: same old sound bug
[0:19:15] Zantex0: cant change it in game
[0:19:16] Xelcion: So we never touch shadowlands again KEKW
[0:19:17] Fawcheddar: ive had issues ith my sound in the wrong output after the patch
[0:19:23] Turet78: So what will be faster? 50%+ anniversary bonus or Dragonflight leveling?
[0:19:24] Layliah79: mrgmHey Good Morning!
[0:19:29] DeveKr: yeah, start over. lol. some of us havent seen it yet.
[0:19:34] Zantex0: requires level 48
[0:19:39] Mejafo: whoops
[0:19:45] bluesixer: Are the devs trying to tell us something lol?
[0:19:54] tiyanigean: @Turet78 mathematically, dragonflight, by about 10%
[0:19:54] Fawcheddar: are you 48
[0:19:55] Siegdjffermin: LUL
[0:19:56] Forgiven78: Goooood Morning, Dan!
[0:20:08] sshen13: isn't this supposed to go live next week? prepatch part 2
[0:20:10] polarbearchef: portals?!  we don't need no stinking portals!!!
[0:20:11] MachoCham: I just went HERE TAKE MY MONEY
[0:20:11] Elswyth_62: i want the bunny
[0:20:21] Faeynna: I have my gigmurloc now. :D
[0:20:24] Fawcheddar: cool mounts we wont use in dragonflight
[0:20:25] tiyanigean: yep
[0:20:30] Turet78: I saw it and it's just too much money for me in one time
[0:20:32] polarbearchef: @machocham same
[0:20:36] Faeynna: I bought it
[0:20:39] Xelcion: They asking an 12 month sub so incase dragonflight sucks you still paid for the year KEKW
[0:20:41] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[0:20:42] handlebarswow: got it immediately lol
[0:20:45] tiyanigean: and the "bunny" chinese new years mount is also in it
[0:20:47] JohnAlterat: it's hilarious. We will have new mount system and they gave ground mounts - for the God, what the...k
[0:20:47] Dark_lite7: I'm so tempted to get it. it's a lot of money though
[0:20:48] TrashmasterRihi: I got it
[0:20:57] Amadan1616: Portl required lol 48
[0:21:12] Amadan1616: Lvl
[0:21:13] handlebarswow: nah they need that money up front lol
[0:21:17] Elswyth_62: fair enough, i don't like them enough for that.  Will the bunny be available for a standard 6 month sub?
[0:21:24] Dark_lite7: Have you noticed how there is no monthly saving between the 6 and 12 month options? seems odd
[0:21:32] Turet78: If it would be cheaper that 2 6-month sub I consider it but 130EUR is just too much
[0:21:38] SlithTheSivak: pvp gear is gone, so if you got it before they removed it it also got a significant bump in power
[0:21:49] emarol_dk: Im just poor, cant pay that amount of money up front, allmost all we got :(
[0:21:51] MachoCham: People moaning like they've never encountered a business before
[0:22:03] Dark_lite7: i'd honestly feel more incline if there  was even more saving per month
[0:22:03] RetroHACK: @MrGM Do you find it odd that the mounts will be useless in dragonflight
[0:22:06] SkyForged13: I mean they did give more rewards so you could say that those are your additional savings
[0:22:06] JBoshr: helllooo!
[0:22:07] francescothepainter: me

[0:23:08] emmby_: Mine arrived today
[0:23:13] Faeynna: I got an email yesterday that it will arrive on Friday
[0:23:14] pgm128: you sound drunk trying to pronounce some of these names LUL
[0:23:38] Turet78: America got it last week so EU will be this or next week
[0:23:54] Dark_lite7: i'm surprised they got sent out this early. Part of the reason i didn't get the collectors was due to maybe getting it after release
[0:24:00] Syghtless: Solo shuffle has actually been pretty fun but it has soem leaver issues
[0:24:00] MedicCasts: YEah, typical blizzard delaying EU update
[0:24:03] Turet78: I saw some tweet
[0:24:05] polarbearchef: uh
[0:24:09] polarbearchef: I didnt
[0:24:19] polarbearchef: just devs showing it off
[0:24:27] Dark_lite7: it's a US code though, so he had to give it away haha

[0:25:24] Demeternoth: My DF CE is on the way!! I AM SO HYPE
[0:25:26] Thoreya: ru guys mad that u have to be there instead of being home and play
[0:25:47] Thoreya: touche
[0:26:03] SlithTheSivak: is the dragon castle in London?
[0:26:04] bluesixer: They won't be playing, they are going to be living it.
[0:26:14] JBoshr: do you have to watch the same streamer for 4 hours to get the Feldrake or can i watch different people to accumulate the watch time?
[0:26:14] shittywizzard: we can't lvl to 60 outside of shadowlands yet right? (on retail)
[0:26:23] Dark_lite7: real life dungeon in a castle
[0:26:25] Shocklate_: Morning gamers
[0:26:45] Stuie_looie: wales
[0:26:50] Stuie_looie: oops
[0:26:56] SkyForged13: Do you get any additional swag for going to the event?
[0:27:05] Shocklate_: currently out of coffee and very sad
[0:27:10] xKenpachi: Can normal people attend the event ?
[0:27:33] Dark_lite7: @Shocklate_ i'm so sorry
[0:28:06] amricatt: Great video on the new crafting system!
[0:28:16] Shocklate_: but there are also way more channels hosting events
[0:29:09] Big_Rum: Hello There!
[0:29:14] Shocklate_: <3
[0:29:21] SlithTheSivak: everythings coming up Milhouse
[0:29:30] francescothepainter: Just managed to snagg a Collectors edition after them being sold out Pog
[0:29:36] andawana: I would think the crafting video will do better when we can craft in game and watch the video at the same time
[0:29:39] Big_Rum: Any News?
[0:29:41] GPTurismo: Good. You're my top streamer besides real world friends (and you're better than them anyway lol)
[0:29:49] Big_Rum: Is it good news?
[0:30:15] drakehandmoonruner: was that the 3500 mount
[0:30:18] Big_Rum: Very nice!
[0:30:19] JBoshr: do you think they could delay DF or reckon its pretty safe to book the time off work now LUL
[0:30:30] SlithTheSivak: theres an event today?
[0:30:41] MedicCasts: Onscreen?
[0:30:47] MedicCasts: He tweeted that he's got an invite

[0:36:39] Stuie_looie: levl 50-60 now or when shadowlands/BFA can be used for those levels?
[0:36:45] Axxon5: i got it at least xD
[0:37:28] Axxon5: just one question i have, when you place an order, you post the amopunt to pay, that should include the payment for the materialas the crafter spends too right?
[0:38:09] MachoCham: TSM will do a lot of this I'd imagine
[0:38:15] Turet78: A bit weird there's nothing about the 18th anniversary.
[0:38:20] Axxon5: ahhh get it, i'd love and addon like that xD
[0:38:26] ZipZapShiny: Assuming you can cancel orders you placed if you change your mind?
[0:38:33] Stuie_looie: theres xp buff
[0:39:05] Stuie_looie: bit weird that it lasts up to after dragonflights released

[0:44:29] Faeynna: At 35
[0:44:41] MachoCham: 7400 per quest
[0:45:17] Faeynna: But I think the exp needed from 35-> is less per level or something like that.
[0:45:25] Faeynna: It's a really weird level curve they have created
[0:45:37] kuuple_boople: I checked your vod real quick
[0:45:44] kuuple_boople: The last amount of XP was 7,300
[0:46:13] SlithTheSivak: should be 69420

[0:48:16] thunduz: tneNoSnitch tneNoSnitch tneNoSnitch
[0:48:17] SlithTheSivak: following is fine just not limiting it to subscribers
[0:48:25] Axxon5: its like , do what you like to do and get things for that :D
[0:48:25] handlebarswow: I feel like asking viewers to follow to win is like .. totally ok.. a bare minimum requirement yknow? lol
[0:48:41] Elrathir: Narcissus?
[0:48:46] MachoCham: Datamining is EZ right KEKW
[0:48:50] HarryFlynn69: hey as a human youre a llowed a slip up every now and then :p
[0:48:53] Elswyth_62: can we give the 2 gift subs to the same streamer?  I read someone who said it had to be 2 different ones?
[0:49:43] MachoCham: Its gonna be Greeeeeeaaattttt
[0:50:51] vanidril: he would 100% but he doesnt stream on the main
[0:51:02] boosh1337: more money for 2$ steakes

[0:51:15] Elswyth_62: rather give it someone who is not already that rich lol
[0:51:24] MedicCasts: Quick question, I'm running feral for solo content but getting offered weapons. Should I get intellect weapons for resto or just get the highest dps for solo content?
[0:51:29] AJ_Zen: I'm afraid for this new generation. They made lazy people some important figures
[0:51:38] vanidril: yeah if i remember correctly, because of the changed twitch share he did not stream on the main afaik
[0:51:52] MedicCasts: Yeah, end goal is resto
[0:51:58] MedicCasts: I like healing
[0:51:58] vanidril: i think he tweeted somethin about it back then. but maybe it was sarcasm aswell? cant tell 1005
[0:52:01] vanidril: 100%*
[0:52:10] MedicCasts: Ah okay. That makes sense
[0:52:12] MedicCasts: ty
[0:52:30] Stuie_looie: hes also costing twitch alot of money streaming on his alt
[0:53:00] Stuie_looie: not only that, but twitch released the cost for them to host/stream to other people

[0:53:24] Zucchey: Should've clicked on users to see how many are connected
[0:54:39] MachoCham: I don't like it outside of TOF
[0:54:54] Alytanks: what we levelling?
[0:55:10] Faeynna: I guess it could be faster with dungeons in between as well
[0:55:19] skympii: a hunter thats new
[0:55:23] handlebarswow: "a hunter.. surprisingly" lol
[0:55:25] Faeynna: And for some reason I think that Blizzard is aiming for people to do dungeons
[0:55:32] MachoCham: Depends right, in the future if you want to "experience" the expansion then it's fine but if you want to be quick there is always better options
[0:56:08] Etzli_GG: Run out of quests?? Thats wild. Ive done cromie time for mostly all other xpacs and usually hit max or close too well before ending the xpac content
[0:56:13] Aierwin: Hey MrGM, has your collectors edition arrived yet? Mine's just come today. Its so beautiful.
[0:56:27] MachoCham: I can do Kraken's route practically in my sleep now
[0:56:35] MediumRareOG: you do the WoD intro, for a start
[0:56:35] bluesixer: WoD currently gives a lot of XP in the intro
[0:56:35] Potatojim: according to Bellular WoD is the best for leveling. Havent tried it yet though
[0:56:49] handlebarswow: WHY?! aren't those all CEs behind you?
[0:56:54] panseit: @Aierwin mine not shipped yet :/
[0:56:56] lillmandaa: Will it come new battlegrounds in DF?
[0:57:11] MachoCham: If you just want to use a singular Chromie area then WoD or Legion are hard to beat
[0:57:14] MediumRareOG: The Spires of Arak outpost gives a 20% xp buff too
[0:57:20] SlithTheSivak: what do you think of the idea of dragon lances?
[0:57:27] Xelcion: Classic zones are rteally good aswell. Some zones at least. Cause they are made without flying in mind and it goes like so fast. Like Loch modon or silverpine forest
[0:57:31] lillmandaa: Damn 😂
[0:57:34] MachoCham: I never do WoD on my runs apart from the intro
[0:57:49] MachoCham: Since they nerfed the shit out of treasures etc
[0:57:58] Xelcion: Intro + some garri quests.
[0:58:01] jaggler: monkaS
[0:58:03] SlithTheSivak: russia
[0:58:30] Mejafo: ch47
[0:58:31] bluesixer: Training exercises probably.
[0:58:33] Shocklate_: KKona the sound of freedom
[0:58:39] Elswyth_62: Lot of those in Odiham
[0:58:48] jaggler: nah, can't be russia, their jets would crash about 5 meteres after they took off KEKW
[0:59:00] Stuie_looie: main defence air base against russia for the UK is as north as you can get in scotland
[0:59:09] GPTurismo: fortunate son playing
[0:59:20] jaggler: their military power is a bit "cringe" as the young people would say"
[0:59:27] drakehandmoonruner: Osprey is the double helo copter
[0:59:31] FCancerNow: Hi MrGM! Do you ever do charity streams? We would LOVE to work with you!
[0:59:45] SlithTheSivak: that would be one of the dumbest things russia could do
[0:59:50] bluesixer: Russia has numbers or had numbers but the tech is dated.
[0:59:51] Stuie_looie: biggest problem for the UK atm is the people in the UK
[0:59:52] Aierwin: Lol... russia can't even handle Ukraine, they don't have the capacity to attack anyone else.
[0:59:55] jaggler: LUL Russia can't even deal with Ukraine, how should they be able to engage anywhere else
[0:59:55] Elswyth_62: not sure we will be their first target tbh
[0:59:56] MachoCham: If Russia did attack near me then they'd probably do 2m in improvements
[1:00:03] SlithTheSivak: any attack on any UN nation would be immediately retaliated against
[1:00:28] jaggler: @SlithTheSivak you mean NATO, right? LUL
[1:00:29] drakehandmoonruner: Russia don't want to see UK or US in a battlegrounds

[1:00:54] AJ_Zen: Its politics Russa has power to start ww3 but its not in their interest. Ukraine is in their interest. But media takes thing out of proportion
[1:00:58] MachoCham: I'll worry about it when I have to worry about it
[1:01:43] ActusXD: Attack anyone in the UN? Russia and Ukrain are in the UN…
[1:01:54] Aierwin: @mahavailogaming Russia does not have any power xD. It wouldn't even be WW3. They can barely survive whats happening in ukraine. Their economic and military would decimated if they touched a NATO coutnry.
[1:01:57] jaggler: @mahavailogaming Russia has barely any power (anymore) people were afraid, but we see now that their military is kinda pathetic. They only power they have is the fear of nuclear strikes
[1:02:56] ActusXD: Thats a significant power…

[1:17:39] BBMezzy: Trivial quest tracking option is still visible for me
[1:18:00] MediumRareOG: Yeah I only care where the inn and mailbox are. I don't care where the barber is

[1:21:37] MediumRareOG: I have 469 but I have almost none of the ZM mounts
[1:21:48] Tauren0309: I got 15 mounts in 2 days just by exalted Achivements
[1:21:56] Mystic_Bard: simple armory is goated <3
[1:22:15] Tauren0309: Dungeon Spamming :)
[1:22:26] MediumRareOG: I'm working on 100 Exalted reps. 96/100. That'll be anohter mount
[1:22:46] CosmicLich: CosmicLich subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:22:47] Tauren0309: Quick 7 min for Britanica and 14 runs
[1:23:12] MediumRareOG: you get like 2k rep per Botanica run. You can do a run in ~5 minutes. So maybe 20k/hour
[1:23:18] Tauren0309: Yeah, I was bored
[1:23:25] Turet78: 8 extra mount from the Dracthyr starting zone will be an easy boost
[1:23:32] MediumRareOG: Heroic Botanica is like 3k
[1:23:59] Luis_as99: what is the dracthyr mount??
[1:24:04] Luis_as99: i didnt know they had one
[1:24:08] Tauren0309: I think so as it worked for me...
[1:24:30] Iwony: the dragon Talbuks
[1:24:49] Iwony: ottuks
[1:25:00] drakehandmoonruner: to be clear how much more points will we get when  we hit max in DF
[1:25:04] MediumRareOG: Botanica is the best but I ran through all the Outland dungeons to max the different reps and get the transmog
[1:25:07] Luis_as99: vorquin
[1:25:12] Iwony: yeah I mean another sort of mount we can get
[1:25:23] drakehandmoonruner: on each side or total
[1:25:24] francescothepainter: 5 in each tree*
[1:25:50] MediumRareOG: Wrath you only do if you want to champion Wrath reps
[1:26:02] SkyForged13: Hard agree
[1:26:24] Reyoness: Yeah they Drust did not add enough of it.
[1:26:32] MediumRareOG: I mean you can do them for classic reps but Botanica is better
[1:26:49] Mystic_Bard: eh ?
[1:26:54] Iwony: yeah...... and ? ^^
[1:26:59] Vorryk: The rumored "cut" is that Korthia is assets from cut Drust content and Tazavesh, an actual city, was supposed to be Korthia before the cut
[1:27:02] CrithiasTheEggman: yes
[1:27:03] Mystic_Bard: you havent noticed that ?
[1:27:14] Mystic_Bard: :o
[1:27:14] Iwony: we knew that for ages ^^
[1:27:18] MedicCasts: Sorry for using you as an FAQ, I just got a random drop 'Memory of a timeworn dreambinder'. Is this something I should be saving/selling/using?
[1:27:20] AndreMSAL: just like voldemort?
[1:27:23] AndreMSAL: clever
[1:27:41] AndreMSAL: i had no idea too
[1:27:49] MedicCasts: Ah okay, so I can just ignore it
[1:27:51] MedicCasts: ty ty
[1:28:14] francescothepainter: I am tom riddle
[1:28:15] Iwony: Tom Riddle?
[1:28:17] CrithiasTheEggman: tom, a dildo lover
[1:28:20] LadyPixelz: tom marvolo riddle = i am lord voldemort
[1:28:20] skewlbeta: Tom morvolo
[1:28:21] Mystic_Bard: from his real name
[1:28:35] AndreMSAL: "I am Lord Voldemort" is an anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle".
[1:28:46] Axxon5: i'm lord voldemort is an anagram of Thomas "something" Riddel
[1:28:57] francescothepainter: yeah had it a bit messed up :P
[1:29:00] newkingcody: did you see eu reset time change
[1:29:02] Mystic_Bard: at least those 2 are way way more thoughtful than Dracula -> Alucard
[1:30:05] AndreMSAL: @Mystic_Bard i actually never noticed that.
[1:30:07] baltasarr80: 3 pm in Germany
[1:30:32] Nulgar: I think it's better, used to be 3am CET back during BC and WotLK
[1:30:41] baltasarr80: ah ok
[1:30:44] AndreMSAL: 2:20 in portugal. US Reset in 40 minutes i think.
[1:30:44] Mystic_Bard: it should 5 in germany, for me it will be 6
[1:30:46] Nulgar: it's nice to have a fresh day when you get up early
[1:30:49] Aierwin: They might aswell move it to the US time...
[1:31:33] Mystic_Bard: @Mystic_Bard I am not into that fandom, a friend had told me and it seemed lazy to me
[1:31:40] Aierwin: Less time to complete the weekly reset qeust before we reset when DF releases xD
[1:31:58] UnhaltedGB: That reset change isn't for NA though, it's EU only?
[1:32:03] Mystic_Bard: @Aierwin maybe the new time will be late evening for us ? especially east coast ?
[1:32:26] Mystic_Bard: west coast sorry*
[1:32:30] Aierwin: Im UK, so it'll be 5Am for me.
[1:32:32] Nulgar: no I mean when you get up at 7 or 8, the daily reset has already happened, and you can do stuff again instead of waiting for 9am (using the former German times)
[1:32:41] Aierwin: DUnno what they're doing with the reset, just merge it all imop
[1:32:51] S3N71: Good afternoon MrGM and stream chat
[1:32:54] CrithiasTheEggman: that is the swift gloomhoof mount, the npc is called night mare
[1:33:05] Luis_as99: does the expansion start at 00:00 or at reset?

[1:33:26] Match_play: there is appeareances for dragons though :/
[1:33:26] Nulgar: tbh dungeon mounts are way too rare, I'd rather have mounts from more determinate sources
[1:34:20] Aierwin: I believe all mounts should have a bad luck protection. Even if you have to kill the boss 100 times for 100 tokens.
[1:34:23] Mystic_Bard: yeh especially for east europe, it is like 10am, and even more ppl are awake and playing
[1:34:24] Nulgar: I mean ingame :P I'd rather farm a rep or do a challenge than run a dungeon 2-5 expansions later and hope for a drop

[1:44:50] Xelcion: bfa zones and cities --> shadowlands cities and zones
[1:44:51] jaggler: Shadowlands had its positives, it had its negatives i'd say it was "meh" overall
[1:44:58] CrithiasTheEggman: i thought bfa was better than shadowlands
[1:45:08] jaggler: i mean, people start saying stuff like "WoD is great"
[1:45:16] wooshi83: He is a BOSS

[1:47:52] Reyoness: Ew

[1:51:08] S3N71: I remember putting a disposable bbq on a glass topped garden table as we were out of coals.  That did not end well
[1:51:10] thunduz: My costume was too dope to share
[1:51:27] HarryFlynn69: what has been seen cannot be unseen
[1:51:28] jaggler: we have to face our demons
[1:51:28] SlithTheSivak: blue waffle
[1:51:40] Shocklate_: nothing like watching cartel beheading videos before school

[1:51:59] jaggler: the gamergate happened and everybody became racist, sexist and hoophobic

[1:52:47] Mystic_Bard: @Jezebelley I remember going there on school like in 6th grade, teachers were NOT HAPPY :D
[1:52:52] SlithTheSivak: the darker sides of reddit still have rotten content
[1:52:55] jaggler: @SlithTheSivak well it became way more acceptable and it was a "gateway drug" for many to radicalize themselves
[1:52:57] Thunder_God_Bane: i doubt it still exists lol
[1:52:58] Mystic_Bard: yes yes

[1:53:19] AndreMSAL: @Mystic_Bard what is halloween if not carnival without samba?
[1:53:35] SlithTheSivak: publicfreakout, nsfl etc
[1:53:36] Etzli_GG: Reddit used to be the wild wild west of the inernet. It was nuts.
[1:53:40] HarryFlynn69: hmm. i wonder why mental health issues are on the rise...
[1:54:37] gorkamorka41782: Cheer100 I remember the dark times. The times of Rotten, Stile Project and the old Something Awful forums. Oh the horror. Oh the humanity
[1:54:48] Mystic_Bard: @Mystic_Bard candies etc I guess :P but yeh generaly the same thing, just different time of year
[1:55:07] DarkEnforcer: will this channel be part of blizz twitch drops program ??
[1:55:21] S3N71: I have no idea what I clicked, but I get a lot of Reddit transmogs popping up on my PC all the time, but some of them are so cool
[1:55:23] DarkEnforcer: great thx
[1:55:27] fooxytv: it's basically moved to whatapp groups now - it's horrible
[1:55:30] wooshi83: only if you sign up I think
[1:55:45] Nulgar: every channel will be, yes, although the streamer has to enable drops in general, a global Twitch setting
[1:56:33] DarkEnforcer: @Nulgar that was what i heard to
[1:56:42] wooshi83: They might get it for their next big thing
[1:56:59] Nulgar: Settings > Channel and Videos > Viewer Rewards > Drops > Enable Drops
[1:57:12] S3N71: Asmon probably does ;-)
[1:57:21] Nulgar: and aren't Classic streams in the same game category? Or what were you talking about?
[1:57:28] fooxytv: what if big streamers weren't eligible
[1:57:50] Nulgar: nah, it's just branding
[1:57:58] Nulgar: like, we aren't technically ON Dragonflight yet
[1:58:00] RadlyBear: Do you  have to watch live or can you watch archived?
[1:58:01] jaggler: if you stream classic during DF launch you get banned from WoW Kappa
[1:58:16] wooshi83: live I think
[1:58:18] Rokir_: Heyo! How's it going
[1:58:19] Nulgar: I doubt they'll make Twitch split the game categories
[1:58:36] fooxytv: NDA
[1:58:51] Nulgar: it's just corporatese speaking
[1:58:54] fooxytv: that's what someone that's signed one would say...
[1:58:56] wooshi83: you get so much news and never tell us anything like secret emails
[1:59:01] CosmicLich: wtf I just got beta.
[1:59:21] vanafindial: the colour of your mount looks like the 1 we'll bet on the 28Th
[1:59:51] jaggler: he hacked the mount into the gamefiles already
[1:59:56] vanafindial: blizzard gift to you or from CG?
[2:00:09] vanafindial: ah
[2:00:18] CosmicLich: nah, just randomly popped in my bnet.
[2:00:22] GPTurismo: wish the night fae ability was a capstone in the hunter class tree
[2:00:22] Axxon5: you have to go through every color rune on the floor, they give you buffs
[2:00:24] Iwony: move between patches
[2:00:50] Iwony: you can have all 3 if I remember correctly
[2:01:20] noobius12323211: Hey MrGM what are your thoughts on the increased crime rates in the UK due to the Yodie Gang?
[2:01:35] rbgdev: You can tell me the secrets, I won’t tell I promise
[2:02:08] RaegonGaming: Yodie these nutz?

[2:04:10] WIPEOUT67: Genuine Question, did anyone else log in today and find a Dracthyr Tabard in their bags? but only on one toon...
[2:04:14] JohntheBarbarian: he smokes in random fast food places while vlogging about his life
[2:04:16] Iwony: did you do both sides?
[2:04:20] MachoCham: @JohntheBarbarian That sentence looks like it was written by my 8 year old
[2:04:27] newkingcody: im going to yodie land boys
[2:04:33] bwoods79: I was hoping you'd have some good music going. My daughter has been playing that jax song "i know victoria's secret" nonstop so it's stuck in my head. If you haven't heard it don't play it..very catchy
[2:04:34] Rokir_: @WIPEOUT67 Do you have a picture?

[2:04:54] JohntheBarbarian: its the zoomer trend, he has vibes that the people enjoy
[2:05:07] Rokir_: @WIPEOUT67 Thanks, DM me in Disc or here when you got it.
[2:05:10] noobius12323211: I am 23 does that make me a zoomer chat?
[2:05:11] StreamElements: Ads will now be running every hour for 3 minutes. This is an automated system that'll help new viewers not receive pre-roll ads. If you're already subbed, Good news! You shouldn't be seeing these.

[2:05:21] MachoCham: Isn't Faded a haircut?
[2:05:21] JohntheBarbarian: EXACTLY
[2:05:24] Iwony: ok how to ruin your health I guess
[2:05:31] MedicCasts: I thought a fade was a haircut
[2:05:37] AJ_Zen: Todays generation and their taste. I swear military service needs to be mandatory
[2:05:38] JohntheBarbarian: but hey, the kid is self aware atleast LUL
[2:05:55] wooshi83: thats not content tbh
[2:05:56] Etzli_GG: LOL
[2:05:57] Yagr6: lol offended
[2:06:00] Jayaresmith: LOL
[2:06:03] gorkamorka41782: @mrgm it's just the latest Twitch trend to watch that idiot high out of his mind in random places.
[2:06:06] Alourra: "content"
[2:06:11] noobius12323211: that is not content
[2:06:17] noobius12323211: at most it is satire
[2:06:22] amu198: condemning drug/alcohol abuse = belittling "content"
[2:06:24] amu198: lolol
[2:06:31] HollowsKido: Oh hai
[2:06:34] Jayaresmith: wait so is the guy vaping or smoking?
[2:06:38] MachoCham: I remember my first time on the internet
[2:06:51] Iwony: an idiot?
[2:06:54] Yagr6: look at the views too soo dumb
[2:07:07] Mystic_Bard: he IRL fated bosses ? :P
[2:07:07] JohntheBarbarian: @mrgm he is popular bc its zoomer stuff and he has clippable sound bytes like "fadedthanahoe" - is self aware
[2:07:08] Iwony: prolly faded his brain away....
[2:07:14] AdamShwaginz: Hello there :)
[2:07:24] sentokiisarg87: The decay of society.
[2:07:29] HarryFlynn69: @AdamShwaginz hey hey!
[2:07:33] MachoCham: This is adding 0 value to my life
[2:07:33] RaegonGaming: Oh wow
[2:07:35] WIPEOUT67: @Rokir_ DM
[2:07:39] Jayaresmith: GUN FINGERS MY DUDES
[2:07:40] GPTurismo: gag >.>
[2:07:42] Yagr6: i lost cells
[2:07:44] Yagr6: ty
[2:07:46] ChrisarN: I lose faith in humanity...
[2:07:48] noobius12323211: time for you to pivot from wow content to getting high in all your favorite uk places while yelling fadedthenahoe
[2:07:48] vanafindial: omg what a two*
[2:07:48] emmby_: "Yep, that's all I needed to see"
[2:07:50] TwoShotTV: GUN Fingies!
[2:07:50] CosmicLich: I feel like their entire personality is getting high high and that's about it. Smoking is their entire personality. Which.. sure, I suppose. Not my cup of tea most def.
[2:07:56] JohntheBarbarian: its a twitch trand bc it has good clip moments for streamers
[2:07:56] GPTurismo: lmfao
[2:07:57] ShadowLight35: i couldn't take 2 seconds of that guy
[2:07:59] AJ_Zen: Again military service should be mandatory and Kids should not have acces to internet and smartphones
[2:08:03] GPTurismo: ban incoming in 3, 2... lol
[2:08:04] LadyPixelz: rofl
[2:08:11] Axxon5: i think 2 seconds is way to much xD
[2:08:20] skewlbeta: "just leave content creators alone" he says to the content creator
[2:08:29] wooshi83: We should bring Miliary Service back for sure
[2:08:46] Smurflord: Enhance shaman is still great fun to play
[2:08:56] vanafindial: it would be a great idea
[2:08:57] Jayaresmith: I dunno people get fucked up from militasry service too right?
[2:08:57] CrithiasTheEggman: i did military service and it did nothing for me
[2:08:59] AJ_Zen: either they get better or they burn out and finish on street
[2:09:03] Yagr6: dude i wanna get faded ahhh Kappa
[2:09:24] amu198: i hate how they think its cool, was at a gig the other night and the amount of people vaping in the crowd was driving me mad
[2:09:28] Jayaresmith: Imma go get super faded at my local ASDA and strim it
[2:09:29] Dryst17: I never understood why people who smoke weed always have to announce to everyone in discord theyre packing a bowl lol
[2:09:31] MachoCham: By that token I can't say that Mrs Browns Boys is an abomination of comedy. We're allowed to critique media.
[2:09:36] Mystic_Bard: @mahavailogaming it is in my country, phones are not allowed except old non-smart phones, but everyone bring one, and after they are done, they are not better, maybe worse even :\
[2:09:41] AJ_Zen: Ok todays military service is a joke. Im talking about SFRJ military service.
[2:09:54] JohntheBarbarian: youre getting old mrgm LUL
[2:10:06] SlithTheSivak: back in myyyy day
[2:10:07] MachoCham: If you don't want to be called cringe. Don't do cringe shit.
[2:10:26] Rokir_: Check Disc when you get a sec, some kinda cool stuff
[2:10:27] AntiHero8Seven: Tide pode thing was the dumbest shit i've ever seen on the internet
[2:10:27] Yagr6: kids are easily influenced, look at Fortnight LUL
[2:10:29] vanafindial: is the tree stump weapon over there in beta
[2:10:36] MediumRareOG: Over 200 people so far have died taking selfies
[2:10:38] wooshi83: Yeah all for 5 mins of fame because they can't do anything else in life
[2:10:52] Rokir_: Apparently he just logged in and it was in his bags
[2:10:55] WIPEOUT67: @MrGM I logged in today, and it was just there
[2:11:07] WIPEOUT67: on my druid, yes sir
[2:11:18] kaecera: !discord
[2:11:18] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/MrGM
[2:11:21] WIPEOUT67: yup yup
[2:11:22] Rokir_: Enjoy your collectors item! Non-Dracthyr can never get that I assume
[2:11:32] Elrathir: apparently some guild tabards have been turning into dracthyr tabards
[2:11:34] Yagr6: can i get the gold back i spent on the fel drake years ago? NotLikeThis
[2:11:34] Jayaresmith: @MrGM Have I missed your contract announcement yet btw? Or is that yet to come...
[2:11:45] MachoCham: Know another bit of valuable advice? Don't cross promote in other streams. You're literally asking for content to either be shot at or banned. Especially when it's completely different content, talk about being tone deaf.
[2:11:54] Mystic_Bard: it can't pop in your bags if your bags are always full 5head :D
[2:12:05] Jayaresmith: Can't wait for the ultimate UK streamer house Keepo
[2:12:36] Jayaresmith: That's exactly what you would say if it was that :o
[2:12:59] Yagr6: i think i spent over 2mil gold on the fel drake
[2:13:01] Mystic_Bard: not mine :P I hopped initially the new slot will be a new bag, so more spacce to instal fill up, but it's for crafting
[2:13:03] WIPEOUT67: logged in for vault rewards and it was there haha

[2:13:22] doomwh1sp3r: @Yagr6 When?
[2:13:26] Jayaresmith: I imagine it'd feel similar to living in student halls... I've never done it and at 28 have no interest in that sort of life experience now
[2:13:35] Yagr6: years ago
[2:13:42] doomwh1sp3r: Fel drake is 50-60m EU...or was
[2:13:45] Yagr6: mop
[2:13:52] Alfsgaming: popping in to say hello
[2:13:54] Iwony: Korthia and Zereth
[2:13:58] rkvothe14: ezx
[2:13:58] Mystic_Bard: EZ
[2:14:14] vanidril: they should just make Zereth mortis campaign also for leveling
[2:14:16] CrithiasTheEggman: did you do the daiily torghast run?
[2:14:17] SlithTheSivak: toprghast xp?
[2:14:27] vanidril: or maw, but with maw not being able to fly it would be better to instantly go to ZM
[2:14:30] MachoCham: How is the 4pm stream going to work?
[2:14:57] noobius12323211: Hey @mrgm how do you feel about the one year subscription deal. I would buy but I bought the six month one a couple months ago and they don't give a discounted price to just add the addtional months which I think is kind of dumb.
[2:15:00] Etzli_GG: Do you think they nerfed xp gains in SL too much? I feel like you shouldnt  be that far away from 60 doing all the content right?
[2:15:01] SlithTheSivak: beta?
[2:15:01] vanidril: i only did the main campaign in SL one fucking time LUL
[2:15:10] rkvothe14: keys on beta or in retail?
[2:15:44] bwoods79: I still think it sucks you can't use bnet balance for subs.. so couldn't buy tokens to get the 12 month promotion
[2:15:47] Nulgar: I haven't been charged yet
[2:15:48] Faeynna: Yes
[2:15:49] vanidril: yeah apparently
[2:15:51] MachoCham: You're buying an extra 12months sub. so if you have an active 6 month you'd get 18 months
[2:15:53] vanidril: but that is hella weird
[2:15:59] Promilie: yeah whenever you add gametime you pay immediately and then all the time stacks.
[2:16:01] Faeynna: I did it, and my next payment will be in March 2024
[2:16:02] MediumRareOG: Check your account page
[2:16:04] Nulgar: and the mail sounded like it would only charge once my current sub had run out
[2:16:10] Zifijo: before you click purchase it says on the bottom that it adds to your current sub
[2:16:12] Yagr6: just wait the mount will be on the shop one day
[2:16:15] MachoCham: I think it depends on the country as well. I was charged.
[2:16:16] Zifijo: charged immediately
[2:16:24] vanafindial: go to your ac and it should say when it runs to
[2:16:26] Promilie: But once all your gametime runs out it will try to renew, so watch out for that
[2:16:30] michaelmm: I took my money right away but moved the next renewal date out by 12 months.
[2:16:32] MediumRareOG: The Blizzard account page tells you when you're paid up to
[2:16:56] BBMezzy: Didn't the launcher used to do that?
[2:17:10] kaecera: It says that you’ll pay immediately for the 12mo and game time of just added
[2:17:21] doomwh1sp3r: If you buy game time, it tells you how many days you have left
[2:17:23] michaelmm: The launcher tells you if you have game time but not a recurring sub.
[2:17:29] Mystic_Bard: :o <3
[2:17:30] Faeynna: Same as mine then!  ^^
[2:17:43] vanidril: so no bothering at all in DF KEKW
[2:17:45] MediumRareOG: So it adds 12 months. I figured it would have to do that
[2:17:46] Nulgar: yep, saw 2024 on mine as well :D
[2:17:52] RadlyBear: The launcher does if you have like 30 day cards and stuff but not if you have a recurring sub
[2:17:58] Arms_Warrior: friends of mines next billing is august 2025
[2:18:00] vanidril: i mean if DF would be the last expansion you have enough playtime LUL
[2:18:42] Jayaresmith: yeah so long as DF isn't a total fucking disaster... I hope to play throughout it....
[2:18:56] Mystic_Bard: not only you 'll be playing, but you 'll have over 1000 viewers daily :D
[2:19:12] Jayaresmith: I can't remember who I said this to yesterday but I was saying I'd be mortified if I had kids that grew up liking people like KSI hahaha
[2:19:21] Stuie_looie: so am i and im nearly 30

[2:23:04] Jayaresmith: cute texts from the bank hehe
[2:23:22] MachoCham: mine said "update your details, dick"
[2:23:23] Stuie_looie: 11th of the 2nd? surely thats a scam text
[2:23:26] zibiKEN: sup @mrgm ! how does SL feel to level in ? 10h to get 43/44 it seems (from 10) not bad is it
[2:23:47] MachoCham: Hide it
[2:23:48] snowyzoex: Ello ello! <3 <3

[2:24:57] zibiKEN: how much time do you reckon it will take leveling 60-70? giving queue times/overcrowded areas etc..? I know you've been timing 60-70 but haven't had the time to watch all the streams >(
[2:25:02] ta1ow: welcome back
[2:25:02] vanafindial: so the dark tabard do you have to go on a certain toon to get it?

[2:25:33] GPTurismo: @snowyzoex Thank you!
[2:25:40] Jayaresmith: Dan important question... Cats or Dogs?
[2:25:41] snowyzoex: snowyz2Jam chaappPepe snowyz2Jam chaappPepe snowyz2Jam chaappPepe snowyz2Jam chaappPepe snowyz2Jam chaappPepe snowyz2Jam chaappPepe snowyz2Jam chaappPepe
[2:25:43] MachoCham: Whale inception
[2:26:00] rkvothe14: guild tabards glitching out to drachtyr tabard, iirc
[2:26:10] snowyzoex: @zibiKEN @GPTurismo Your welcome!! <3
[2:26:11] Nulgar: didn't people randomly get the Raid Boss skin for the Dragon before?
[2:26:12] zibiKEN: so if Id start at launch without hickups and set a good leveling pace , by noon I'll be doing heroics/mythics ? 😁
[2:26:17] vanafindial: ok ta
[2:26:20] Nulgar: probably like that, randomly given out for testing
[2:26:20] Jayaresmith: Good answer haha
[2:26:22] MachoCham: We don't disagree on much, but cats are shit.
[2:26:24] HarryFlynn69: is "neither" a hot take?
[2:26:41] MachoCham: Except Luna ofc, she's wonderful
[2:26:56] Jayaresmith: I love both but only have cats at the mo, had to have indoor cats only as when we lived on a busy road, so we have 2 disabled cats
[2:27:04] MachoCham: (before she kills me next time I see her)
[2:27:05] zibiKEN: m+ not available till raid releases yeah ?
[2:27:20] Stuie_looie: @Jayaresmith because of the road?
[2:27:23] snowyzoex: currently have 8 puppies and 6 kittens in the house, its a mad house
[2:27:39] kristianzum: Then people might be playing pvp :D
[2:27:42] zibiKEN: damn be farming rep when locked out of all m0 for the week 🫣
[2:27:46] kristianzum: pvp is sooooo dead right now
[2:27:50] Jayaresmith: @Jayaresmith No we got the first one alrady with 3 legs bless him, he had the operation like 3 weeks before we adopted him :) Then we got anoither with a heart condition
[2:28:02] Nulgar: it's got pamphlets, it's got stone guys, definitely a reference
[2:28:06] kristianzum: it's max dead, 0 rbgs, only a few arenas
[2:28:12] kristianzum: at least here in eu
[2:28:18] HarryFlynn69: ah so they went for the "bad ending" fix, eh?
[2:28:20] BBMezzy: Yea same, and a win didn't give % again for the mount
[2:28:22] Thunder_God_Bane: i can finally upgrade my pvp gear with my  shuffle 1800 rating HYPERS
[2:28:32] CrithiasTheEggman: that's because they fixed the gear upgrading i assume
[2:28:48] Match_play: How much % do you get for mounts from solo?
[2:28:49] Thunder_God_Bane: hahaha 40k hp
[2:28:56] HarryFlynn69: pvp is easy. just lose and blame the other guy Kappa
[2:29:08] GPTurismo: that will change with df
[2:29:23] zibiKEN: never done solo shuffle loool what is the concept ?
[2:29:26] bluesixer: Shadowlands PVP gear scaling makes PVP hard to enter if you are late
[2:29:28] Nulgar: yes, do some Mythic raids first before queueing for solo PvP
[2:29:50] NIICKLAS_TV: NIICKLAS_TV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! yo hello
[2:30:01] CrithiasTheEggman: well you can at least get honor gear before queuing rated pvp
[2:30:02] HarryFlynn69: classic is a nightmare to get into as a latecommer, too
[2:30:07] baltasarr80: @snowyzoex Danke für das Geschenkabo!
[2:30:09] GPTurismo: well, there will just be 2 pvp sets (and 2 warode sets) honor and conquest. Also they mention there will be ilvl req
[2:30:32] Faeynna: I was like.. 52 months.. that's just a year... and then it hit me... :O
[2:30:44] zibiKEN: LUL
[2:31:25] reaperblade93: What do you think of the feldrake drama?
[2:31:38] zibiKEN: @faeynna roughly 208 weeks mrgmDance
[2:31:45] Jayaresmith: omfg my egg chair just yeeted itself across the patio :(
[2:31:46] Nulgar: how do you get the Warmode set? Random reward for doing stuff while in Warmode, or do you actually have to engage in PvP? I loved 3 out of the 4 WM WQs in SL, easy Marks sometimes without much PvP
[2:32:02] Syghtless: got one friend that is upset cause she has it and now its not special anymore
[2:32:03] HarryFlynn69: whats going on with feldrake?
[2:32:04] snowyzoex: @baltasarr80 Gerne Geschehen!
[2:32:08] GPTurismo: the only people who are truly mad are the people who bought the mount via tcg and shouldn't have
[2:32:20] doomwh1sp3r: There are some people that regularly trade TCG mounts, mostly between themselves for 5-150m gold
[2:32:24] doomwh1sp3r: Now they're just scared for their sales
[2:32:24] Thunder_God_Bane: ye twitch drops should have been a new mount
[2:32:24] FearedOkami: people being babies about it
[2:32:29] Thunder_God_Bane: prefer with dragon riding
[2:32:29] Nulgar: some people think (or claim to believe) that giving hundreds or thousands to scalpers is somehow "prestige"
[2:32:30] Mystic_Bard: I agree, instead of fell drake give us el pollo grande <3
[2:32:37] winchester__x: Small amount of people that already have feldrake ... ok ... but giving it to everyone will make this mount not rare anymore . ^^ @MrGM
[2:32:59] kristianzum: bronze drake with a little twist LUL
[2:33:02] Thunder_God_Bane: lol i would never use the mount
[2:33:05] zibiKEN: you done the dungeon quests yet ? @mrgm ? is it only story mode available or a sort of threads of fate too in SL?
[2:33:06] Faeynna: It will be a +1 for the mount achievement :)

[2:33:18] Syghtless: the problem with tcg moutns is that their rarity was not based on anything relevant, it had nothign with skill or time ivnestment to do
[2:33:22] FearedOkami: wasn't that cool anyway 🤣
[2:33:23] Mystic_Bard: what I find weird is the ppl that don't have it and complain, I mean why ?
[2:33:58] Rperez8602: I’m still stuck trying to unlock the Kultiran race.
[2:34:03] Alexkayzz: hey I havent tried dacthyr dps yet, what's the general opinion on it? Is it fun, is it easy?

[2:36:22] apixelops: oh, the Feldrake's already dropping?
[2:36:25] fooxytv: I've had the dragonflight beta for a while but haven't installed it, it will all be new to me when it's released which I'm excited about
[2:36:28] SkyForged13: Vault of the Incarnates?
[2:36:32] FearedOkami: I haven't been able to try the raid yet though
[2:37:32] eskacat: Hell-o, everyone o/
[2:37:34] Etzli_GG: What, if anything, are you most excited for in DF?
[2:37:48] Samiccus: 25 raiders from IAmSamC6 have joined! 
[2:37:56] fooxytv: would you like to join Blizzard's QA team for World of Warcraft? I've seen that they are requiring new testers
[2:37:57] Etzli_GG: LOL, I feel that
[2:37:57] smrmashups: good answer
[2:38:14] Enzevil: Hey Dan and Chat! What did I miss from the new stuff?
[2:38:28] Samiccus: good good! lmao is that the Fel Drake that almost burned down the wow forums? @MrGM
[2:38:28] snowyzoex: @Enzevil Hey Hey!
[2:38:49] Mr_Underpants: @fooxytv Ill join, sign me the fuck up
[2:38:56] fooxytv: understood :)
[2:39:05] Syghtless: i actually got into their remote qa test for accessibility
[2:39:24] Enzevil: Alright cool ty, also what do you think of Evokers as a class?
[2:39:39] rkvothe14: Having been a QA tester before, I don't think it's a fun job, tbh
[2:39:41] fooxytv: it's currently remote but they are planning on getting everyone back in the office soon
[2:40:04] fooxytv: the job offering
[2:40:19] Stuie_looie: Jed with Jagex wasnt even remote!
[2:40:27] rkvothe14: now, I'd love to work as a SRE/devops for wow
[2:40:28] Stuie_looie: wouldnt my finance job being remote be a security risk
[2:41:42] smrmashups: everything in life is a risk
[2:42:31] Faeynna: I am currently working at a gaming company, and I do fully remote work. :)
[2:43:16] Mystic_Bard: a lot of times especially for remote they provide the PC/laptop etc that has special security software each company uses to lessen the risk and you don't even have the ability to install any other program than the pre approved, this mitigates the security risk a lot
[2:43:35] smrmashups: good point
[2:43:54] Faeynna: Yea
[2:44:10] Faeynna: Only VPN allowed etc. So. :)
[2:44:30] Mystic_Bard: @Faeynna oh that too right :D
[2:45:24] Jayaresmith: My works pretty security concious but I WFH too, nothing a VPN doesn't sort tbh
[2:45:37] Jayaresmith: the vpn is provided by work etc
[2:46:05] Faeynna: That and 2FA
[2:46:15] Jayaresmith: Yep
[2:46:21] Jayaresmith: a neccesary pain in the ass
[2:46:32] Faeynna: I even got a home alarm provided by the company. ^^
[2:46:49] Jayaresmith: What does the alarm.. alarm for?
[2:46:50] fooxytv: @rkvothe14 I used to work with in the battle net team as a devsecops engineer which was pretty fun and exciting
[2:46:54] Jayaresmith: You remoting in?
[2:47:04] Mystic_Bard: @Faeynna oh wow :o
[2:47:15] Faeynna: No.. incase of someone breaking in
[2:47:31] Jayaresmith: Oh a house alarm I see hahaha
[2:47:32] vanafindial: getting nippy?
[2:47:36] kristianzum: wb
[2:47:40] Jayaresmith: That's really good fair play
[2:47:42] Faeynna: Insurance things I guess
[2:47:44] rkvothe14: @rkvothe14 that's really cool! Planning on eventually applying if they have remote options. But I'm currently at a good company, so it'll take a while until I wanna let it go
[2:47:46] Rhasresrhas: Hello
[2:47:46] Mystic_Bard: mrgm goes away, chat talks about IT security etc :D
[2:47:48] Jayaresmith: be nice if my work even contributed towards office supplies hahaha

[2:48:29] Coreantes: Coreantes subscribed with Prime. 
[2:48:42] Rhasresrhas: Hey. I got two questions for you. 1st do you have drops enabled? i would like to watch your stuff for it. 2nd how do you like your computer chair, was it worth the cost?
[2:49:02] Jayaresmith: @MachoCham We live in an 1890s house so heating has been on for a week or two now :(
[2:49:19] Rhasresrhas: I almost bought that chair is why i was asking
[2:49:21] Amyrantha_: You won't get drops from this stream anyway since there are no rewards currently for WoW afaik
[2:49:35] MachoCham: I have the titan 2022 model and 0 complaints from me
[2:49:44] Coreantes: The chair is really good, mine now for about two years as well....
[2:50:02] Jayaresmith: I just have an office chair from work :( it's... OK.....
[2:50:04] Amyrantha_: Get one of those wheely wheels that turn around so you can WEEEEEEE
[2:50:09] MachoCham: Herman Millar. Oooh check you out ££££££
[2:50:09] vanafindial: what's the weight limit on the chair?
[2:50:27] rkvothe14: important to have a 180 degrees chair so you can sleep on the job
[2:50:28] Eliddinn: do you have the feldrake?
[2:50:44] Jayaresmith: lol
[2:50:51] MachoCham: True story btw, Dan is the size of a slyvanian family figure
[2:50:52] vanafindial: am 6"6 over 140KG
[2:50:53] fooxytv: @rkvothe14 Good luck! I'm sure one day they will have openings one day. True, I'm in a similar situation I've moved to contract work which I wouldn't go back to full time at a company
[2:51:06] profienn: my chair is forged from the steel of the gods to hold my chonker self
[2:51:08] smrmashups: Yes, u can really feel the difference in quality chair 300 dollars and up imo.
[2:51:11] Jayaresmith: Our 24hr team put requests in for new chairs in their office, for lazy boy office chairs
[2:51:19] Mystic_Bard: @MachoCham the lead developer of my team got one, he says it's amazing, he also earns A LOT !!
[2:51:25] Rhasresrhas: i would need a bigger chair myself, but the cost is kinda high $300-550
[2:51:46] Lugo44: Lugo44 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! mrgmSmile
[2:52:04] MachoCham: https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/fashion-and-dolls/sylvanian-families/c/SM06010425 this is dan's house

[2:53:43] MachoCham: We had 0
[2:53:51] MachoCham: Because it was absolutely pissing it down
[2:53:56] Amyrantha_: I got a 6mo sub and upgraded it to a 1year sub, but the next payment date is somewhere in march next year. If i change the 1year back to 6mo would i not have the mounts anymore from the latest release? :)
[2:53:57] MachoCham: I mean torrential
[2:54:00] Jayaresmith: It was pissing it down for us so I'm not sure anyone in our village even went out, but we had 0 peopole
[2:54:09] Jayaresmith: @MachoCham Yep rough wasnt it
[2:54:16] MachoCham: Also I shouted out the ring doorbell *I HAVE AN AIR RIFLE"

[2:54:55] rbgdev: Lol
[2:54:57] Eliddinn: yeah
[2:54:59] MachoCham: @Jayaresmith Midlands, it's great.
[2:55:05] eskacat: It's information, it's always worth
[2:55:10] HeyKraye: setting to 1 year now immediately pays for the next 12 months. You can swap back to 6 monthly, but won't pay again for the next yearish
[2:55:21] magemaster225: its worth just telling people where chromie time is because half the streamers I see come back dont know how to start it
[2:55:22] MachoCham: weds
[2:55:24] HeyKraye: Keeping the mounts
[2:55:25] Jayaresmith: @Jayaresmith Ah I'm sorry for your loss ;) South Wales here... perpetual state of raining here

[4:11:38] Jayaresmith: As long as they dont use old content to mask a lack of new content...
[4:11:49] snagprophet: you can also say running the same current expansion dungeon again is "reusing content"
[4:12:27] Amyrantha_: i do think your content is edgy-cational
[4:12:29] Glylyna: Ow wait... Didn't even realize there was a squad mode button lol... They don't show that button in the mod page

[4:55:40] Jayaresmith: if you're somewhere with a lift, surely theres a loo nearby!
[4:56:41] snagprophet: @snagprophet someone put it in my mate's fridge once, and i said "mate wheres the bottle?" and we open the fridge and touch it and its so warm
[4:57:15] Jayaresmith: that's gnarly, uni stuff lol

[4:59:38] snagprophet: I remember people used to just spam ??? when someone went in the wrong lane or didnt help someone and it would cause an argument
[4:59:59] Jayaresmith: Thank god league doesnt have built in voice chat though
[5:00:13] Jayaresmith: would be like the old cod or halo post game lobbys

[5:09:03] Tokkoujo: Coming back after years of not playing, fresh account. Struggling to pick a main atm
[5:09:30] Jayaresmith: @Tokkoujo I think you can do a trial of the classes at like lvl 50? Might be worth a shot?
[5:09:38] Shrapnel_Sponge: they should just release TCG mounts to tank the profit from the resellers of the cards and then make new skins and cool mounts, it's not hard.
[5:10:07] CrithiasTheEggman: next they are gonna distribute atiesh via twitch drop
[5:10:18] Tokkoujo: Looking for DPS that's good soloing content, good sustain and an "escape" from combat. Any ideas?
[5:10:23] coversRbetter: what was that turtle usage
[5:10:34] Tokkoujo: @Jayaresmith Good idea
[5:10:53] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Tokkoujo BM hunter most likely
[5:10:59] Jayaresmith: @Tokkoujo Not sure how you do it but think its a thing still....
