[1:04:47] CallMeWallie: Okay good, why is it called ring worm :
[1:04:54] classictwo: in High school they would have us wash with iodine, to reduce chances of getting it
[1:05:03] CallMeWallie: Does it look like there are worms forming a ring in your skin?
[1:05:12] thekingmitus11: love the swords transmog
[1:05:12] raldrik: towUnforch
[1:05:16] cometreb: Yup, so common that it is not as big of a deal in wrestling any more. A little bleach and clear nail polish will fix it right up
[1:05:17] shadowfold3: you won't even use that one in holy ever either FeelsBadMan

[1:16:05] Roffasauras: we've had 4 wars now, when are we going to learn?
[1:16:06] bypized: @Towelliee Well, I'm just hoping Blizzard doesn't screws up Arthas, otherwise... I'm scared...

[1:18:31] Hank_ish: Smart
[1:18:37] starknadooo: I'm glad they are delaying it. More delays means a more polished game.
[1:18:37] TheUnknowing: I'm cool with that, I liked the new world test, happy for them to take as much time as they need to make it much better.

[1:19:56] BrutalBlueberry: Wish it wasn't 5 man, though. Spice it up a little. Do 3 mans, 6 mans, etc. 5man is just tank, healer, 3 dps. Boring.
[1:20:43] bypized: And the other thing is that New World is not sub based, so people will buy it and leave it dusting to play BC @Towelliee
[1:21:16] Dinokaze: who the fuck is going to buy new world just to play BC lol
[1:21:21] TheUnknowing: Buy to play means you can always go back to it, so doesn't really matter.
[1:22:00] bypized: @Dinokaze Cause you can buy it and come back to play whenever you want. WoW you pay monthly to play, so it causes player urgency to play
[1:22:34] Dinokaze: I can't imagine anyone would have an urgency to play BC
[1:22:40] RazzeronTV: Valheim looks good i may have to pick it up at some point

[1:25:28] Brodih_: was dual spec introduced in late BC ?

[1:25:42] TheUnknowing: wrath @Qhaz_
[1:25:50] uhbuii: You gonna do a 240h or 168h marathon for BC?
[1:25:52] RazzeronTV: Do you think they would consider wrath classic?
[1:25:58] bypized: @Towelliee do you think Blizz would ever release Wraith? I feel like it could backfire on Retail. No?
[1:26:00] NILLme: hope blizz tune the content around the 2.4.3 changes

[1:26:46] FistoTheFistybot: Towelliee Whats your favourite zone in wow
[1:26:47] GermanBacon: @Towelliee did anything happen to the Valheim server? cant connect to it...
[1:26:53] showmethesugar35: How many attemps in ur life time for the love rocket?
[1:27:06] BrutalBlueberry: My favorite TBC content was the April Fools they revealed with the Bard clas with a Guitar Hero controller for abilities.

[1:30:17] Artivicii: digging the new emote towUnforch
[1:30:20] Garrujak: I think they'll use 2.4.3, no reason for the "classic leveling experience" you can go play classic for that now
[1:30:21] nyberrite: 30% quicker 1-60 by end of TBC
[1:31:07] Plague_GG: will people still be able to play vanilla classic tho @garrujak
[1:31:52] Garrujak: I can't imagine they'd take away classic. All those people who begged for vanilla will just beg through TBC/WotLK. My money is on them merging servers
[1:32:04] TheUnknowing: Vanilla classic will still be there
[1:32:40] Plague_GG: dizzyUp
[1:33:07] Garrujak: They have a lot of low and medium pop servers that really don't get used all that much these days. Likelihood is they add some servers for TBC only, use some of the classic servers to get turned into TBC, and then do the same for WotLK
[1:33:07] stallowned: i cant wait for BC!
[1:33:18] CritcobainTV: I really hope they do a level 58 template for new toons on servers! I don't want to level all over again

[1:35:35] Garrujak: I really hope my prediction of copying chars from WotLK to Retail will come true. Play classic for all 3 expacs and then bring that character to Retail at like 50 or whatever so you can play the new shit
[1:35:40] NickLeonhearth: It was the same before lol

[2:01:01] BigCarlM: Yes def. ceiling in SL
[2:01:03] robbiev45: it went dull because of the repetition. but you cant stop because of the no catch up system

[2:01:18] Strik3r019: i got a 190 the 1st week of BFA from that

[2:05:10] NILLme: they made them worse in sl
[2:05:13] Roffasauras: it's world quests, but take twice as long
[2:05:15] failure2: its the multiple step world quests
[2:05:23] temp3st98: flappy bird wq LUL
[2:05:26] Xerothrone: well, theres the 10 step wq now,. which are horrible
[2:05:28] obbi87: WQs are quite boring, i would give everything to get DAilys back, do 10 dailys and turn all in
[2:05:38] Chris_127: Longer and less rewarding =2.0/SL

[2:05:47] iseenoobpeoplee: bfa was better than this boring no loot expansion
[2:05:51] Malarick: but the PVP system doesnt work that well for casuals due to the rating requirements to upgrade. Causuals get stuck at 200 b/c they dont have the time/gold to get boosted. I certainly dont.

[2:05:57] Roffasauras: I have a 194 Hymnal, but a 184 Bell NotLikeThis
[2:06:01] KingSlayerYotam: also callings are the same as before, just changed the name

[2:10:43] Thoreya: like warfronts, invasions, islands, pvp, m+, assaults, visions, raid. lmao thats why people complained
[2:10:46] Thoreya: too much shit
[2:11:08] Dlaw25: It does cater to everyone, but there has to be a reward system for the grinders, who are able to play +8 hours a day
[2:11:20] NILLme: imagine trying to pug 15 without rio :D
[2:11:52] Thoreya: i think its slightly exaggerated
[2:11:54] Thoreya: imo
[2:11:54] Malarick: even as a casual, I should not have to run 15 M+dungeons and get no drops. system is broken.

[2:13:04] NILLme: titanforging + a way to upgrade our gear ilvl wouldnt be a bad system
[2:13:25] MetaKuron: Why don't they have a system, if it's your key you get 1 guaranteed item drop with a weekly cap aside from the normal drops

[2:13:40] azzurrin: Isn't this why we have CLassic now, because people wanted old slog playstyle. SO why didn't they bring it to retail.
[2:13:43] GiraffeHydra_: Did an experiment of going guildless this expansion, just wanted to see how difficult the solo life was in terms of finding groups, raids and whatnot. It got way rougher than I anticipated, finding groups as non-FotM could take an hour+, even with an ilvl appropriate or higher than the content required. Somethings gotta give for people who don't choose playing this way but get forced into it
[2:13:43] temp3st98: true
[2:14:09] azzurrin: Should keep it like it was in Legion/BFA
[2:14:16] Dlaw25: that's a good point
[2:14:23] Roffasauras: my buddy's 210 feral druid got declined from a +4 because he was feral LUL
[2:14:38] Kirorga: alts will be easier with valor catchup dont u get 220 loot
[2:14:40] Xailen: Can confirm, going solo this expansion is not that fun.
[2:15:31] Sniper_Penguin: My 218 prot pally gets declined to everything because prot pally.

[2:16:09] Chris_127: yeah half the systems they put in are irrelevant now already
[2:16:12] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee Make them both relevant by adding a crud ton of cosmetics

[2:18:04] Malarick: true dat!! No more pallies looking like DKs or Warriors
[2:18:05] Bulgogiprince: I will take class specific gear without the set bonuses
[2:18:08] temp3st98: i like bonus sets because it made the best gear came out from raids instead of dungeons
[2:18:17] Bulgogiprince: similar to FFXIV artifact gear
[2:18:25] Sniper_Penguin: Who cares if they add tiers back.. it’s gonna take the entire patch to get 1-2 pieces at this rate.
[2:18:26] the_robinhood: Can you equip more than one leggo ?
[2:18:28] Sollice: Make tier sets like legendaries
[2:18:29] Noshpan: Yeah, this expansion has not been motivating me to keep playing.
[2:18:34] Clay2K_: I can't wait for Class ID tmogs again
[2:18:39] Aidler: there are so many inconsistencies in the current game. I have two characters in torghast right now and the difficulty difference of torghast between dps warrior and prot paladin is shocking
[2:18:54] Sollice: Start them as appearance only item and get missives to add stats to them
[2:18:58] Jokervenom1978: Buy your tier set appearances! Only 35,000 anima!
[2:18:59] SSD511_: I don’t understand why blizzard thinks it’s hard to make a set mog for each class
[2:19:01] Sollice: and let you go to the rune forger and make them

[2:19:54] Noshpan: I'll admit, I do miss tier sets. Though Hunter tier sets during Wrath made me sad.
[2:19:58] robbiev45: people won't say that that's true. but in fact they know it really is the reason they love tier sets @Towelliee

[2:20:28] acee626: you are 100% spot on and because of your great take heres a sub
[2:20:30] Buckwink: just make the tier set bonuses something cool like you glow more or some shit

[2:21:39] Thoreya: ah
[2:21:41] BrutalBlueberry: If they make tier bonuses, just make it secondary stats or something. Not like old ones where it totally changes your abilities.

[3:20:53] Throdio: I don't see an Uther Arthas staredown, sounds like Uther will want to get him out of the Maw and help him.

[3:29:50] Xirmak: LOL malfurion aint hittin it right... she needs illidan to knock the nightwarrior out of her
[3:29:53] Reydien: night fae has seen her a few times in torghast during the campaign

[3:32:22] maxlol: anduin is a bitch i miss varian
[3:32:32] ghostofnappa_doom: Arthas was once a Paladin of the Silver hand, but when he chose Frostmourne and betrayed his own men and killed his father he lost his connection to the light. perhaps anduin will be the first paladin but also Lich King powers
[3:32:38] bypized: Anduin will kill the cow
[3:32:44] KingSlayerYotam: anduin becomes the lich king and battle tyrande until she loses the NW buff
[3:32:44] Demanisraar: I bet it still sounds girly AF
[3:32:54] Eriewst: next wow expansion will be Manduin Unleashed. heard it here folks

[3:33:04] Bayne77: a Anduin/Sylvannas final raid boss kinda like the Manastorms
[3:33:08] DrSoosh: He may play the "There must be a lich king" role like davey jones orlando
[3:33:09] bypized: Anduin will kill the cow
[3:33:15] egraves7: he'll sound like the people from the night fae play
[3:33:19] KingofMeccano: who would be the next king/queen then? or will it be a group of people looking after the alliance similar to what is going on with the horde
[3:33:23] Buckwink: the bich king 2.0
[3:33:24] VinnyDaPoooh: what if anduin meets varian in the shadowlands and he tells him to stop being a winey baby LUL
[3:33:25] Demanisraar: @egraves7 Oh god no

[3:42:31] Chris_127: you have way more than 450 from the other years
[3:42:39] michaelmm: The problem is those affixes are not balanced. Tyrannical is worse if you are pushing high keys. Bolstering is bad for low key people when they are undergeared (esp tanks).
[3:42:41] maxlol: i dont mind tyran, it was rough at the beginning with everyone low gear but not anymore

[3:44:49] Kromede: no copri_ow just logged in
[3:44:58] MOLAR305: since its the first affix every week, its way too long in the tooth
[3:45:08] Reydien: the disparity between pushes on Tyrannical weeks and fortified weeks I think shows it's more than just "Being tired". Tyrannical is just worse
[3:45:11] dergNwolf: have the +10 affix be +2 instead
[3:45:25] ghostofnappa_doom: like how many Keys did we do in BFA where you go to Tol Dagor on tyrannical week and on high keys the key would die if anyone died to upheavel from first boss
[3:45:30] Wholoveswaffles: I’m enjoying watching Valheim streams, thinking of getting it myself but defo to play with friends
[3:45:47] bypized: Anduin will kill Baine

[3:46:51] Shammedic: ^
[3:46:54] UberManDude: @Towelliee Heller bro, How are you doing?
[3:47:19] ghostofnappa_doom: imagine us in a new expansion asking blizzard to provide new content instead of repeat affixes. we just ask too much clearly
[3:47:27] MOLAR305: while affixes are meant to make shit harder, maybe a new positive affix at +20 to reward the hard work, like every 4 mins, get +30 dmg for 30 secs etc
[3:47:36] Jarlan23: pull 2 packs on storming and suddenly theres 50 fucking tornadoes
[3:47:42] MOLAR305: 30%**
[3:47:56] Buckwink: yeha people like to feel powerful
[3:48:07] Molseh: This raid tier is so bad with regards to not being able to brute force with gear
[3:48:56] wisperuna: @Towelliee you got a point, but it is even worse with the aoe cap. It's the same logic we have the gear but we can't overpull
[3:48:57] Affiiance: Yeah sometimes I never get tornadoes and sometimes the fucking ground is covered

[3:55:52] Gastt__: @udrisyay what's the name?
[3:56:07] Xailen: why would anyone farm the love rocket dungeon after getting it?
[3:56:11] 0Toust0: Heya Towelie hope you r well
[3:56:26] CDubTheRIPper: i still believe
[3:56:46] ghostofnappa_doom: You probably shouldn't believe every screenshot you see, because Blizzard Forcibly removes the mount off your loot table once you have it. they've done it for everything that isn't a mythic raid mount specifically so there isn't mount trading for gold ect.
[3:56:50] bypized: They will make an expansion out of this
[3:56:56] Kromede: i'm doing it still, want my second rocket Kappa
[3:57:25] willbedone05: I got it after my fifth try on my new Demon Hunter now I can forget about this holiday.
[3:57:35] Jarlan23: yeah i think so
[3:57:36] Shammedic: meta event one yeah
[3:57:37] deeerow: tbh that's the same reaction I had when i just got the love rocket this morning. I was like OMG for like 1min and then thankful I dont have to farm this event anymore or do anything with it. Same page are you @Towelliee
[3:57:50] Jarlan23: a long and dazed confusion or whatever its called

[3:59:34] ghostofnappa_doom: @udrisyay there is vast amount of evidence showing that you don't have mounts on your loottable anymore, if you're unsure, go ahead and ask any mount collecting discord or look for the information online
[3:59:49] spodeee: i think you can still do lunar also so no need to wait a full year
