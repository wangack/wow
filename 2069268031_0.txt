[0:24:16] p3loutrepid: @Naguura what about fearless draft style of league? one class per run per dungeon per team
[0:24:31] niallox: But is that not part of the fun? Not knowing
[0:24:31] Naadd_: Heyo
[0:24:37] seacombe: i came into this halfway through so i may have missed context but i feel like any attempt to control what comps people play in MDI is never gonna work. there will be an optimal choice and they will find it
[0:25:00] dothetangoo: i mean, im not bothered by no healer comps. its still very difficult doing those pulls with no healer so i think it balances itself out.
[0:25:05] onewidit: it's wild that nobody knows the comps, and almost every team ends up running the exact same comp haha
[0:25:20] bigix_gidix: heyo

[0:27:28] niallox: Reduce the healing ability of DPS :)
[0:27:38] onewidit: Maximum was saying on his/Dratnos' pod that running 4 dps should be like pulling a goalie in hockey. More desparation than something you do regularly.

[0:29:33] onewidit: Feels like classes have so many defensives now. More so than previous seasons/xpacs
[0:29:38] Eztho_: tank just needs a little healing requirement maybe

[0:32:00] FrozenAlphaa: so that big pulls mean something
[0:32:00] Miuuu: the higher the key goes the more it becomes midway between mdi and tgp
[0:32:01] jacksplatt: i want to see death and destruction
[0:32:03] FrozenAlphaa: it should be 25

[0:32:37] FrozenAlphaa: not if its low key
[0:32:50] Zir_aus: wait, blizz buffed the leggo aquisition with a hotfix, NOT on reset? bro i killd it on reset. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy not change it on reset sigh
[0:33:05] jacksplatt: it looks easy because they have grinded it to perfection
[0:33:17] highoncaffe1ne: from my perspectiv i dont like the 10-20min runs i would prefer like 25-30min cuz i think its more fun when a team can comeback after a blunder
[0:33:18] Nitram580: @Zir_aus try it on lower difficulty
[0:33:27] FrozenAlphaa: i am not saying its soo easy that i can do it but 23 doesnt feel like a success imo it should be 25
[0:33:30] urchinlo: pull off the echo strat between bosses 2 and 3 on rise in a pug. ill wait
[0:33:36] Zir_aus: @Zir_aus i kill it on heroic once then log off,

[0:36:02] Zilvaan: Problem is only when the dungeon is gated through RP
[0:36:07] vratko18: best heal in your opinion?
[0:36:16] onewidit: Dorki and DrJay were also saying that teams haven't even shown their craziest stuff yet, because they were just trying to get top 4.

[0:37:11] highoncaffe1ne: more pull means to me more parts where a team can mess up so more oportunities for a team to comeback

[0:38:49] zer0crew: is this week a tough week for keys or no? fortified, entangling and bolstering?
[0:38:59] retektroll123: and that's why TGP is more fun to watch
[0:39:29] vampirosx: Why U are not competing in MDI tho?
[0:39:45] Kuroz: cause casting is better
[0:39:52] onewidit: Do you think there could ever be a Raid version of MDI? Or something similar?
[0:39:53] MBG_95: bolstering fort can cause some horrible situations yea
[0:40:00] urchinlo: all the jumpy bois on BRH onto final doable on 23 but not doable on like a 25 is what ur sayin? scaling becomes too much ato some point?
[0:40:09] frastly: TGP is fun, but they should start on higher keys, it is boring during starting keys
[0:40:12] Miuuu: you should cast and compete at the same time literally xD

[0:41:14] famib: how is this a difficult concept lol
[0:41:23] chuckaay: @urchinlo it depends on the risk of the pull; they probably still would because it's not that risky but also there's nothing else they could pull onto last boss
[0:41:38] Cooperharley0204: @urchinlo MDI teams will do the biggest pulls possible specific to the key. Lets say on a 23 that they can pull 3-4 packs, they may only be able to pull 3 at most on a 25 because its harder, but thats the max risk for that 25
[0:41:38] retektroll123: best MDI moment of all time was in bfa when both teams wipe fests in junkyard. that was so fun tho
[0:41:43] Heikki1111: Its about aflix. If it easy they make huge pull
[0:42:02] nastye: @famib tells you much about the average wow brain FeelsBadMan
[0:42:09] FrozenAlphaa: i see what u are saying but people dont care about those things people want to see big numbers big packs on high keys
[0:42:13] Cooperharley0204: This year's MDI was beyond sick. So pumped
[0:42:18] Mell0i: Hey there captur11Rocky
[0:42:35] meozart: so a 4 dps key can’t be done higher with a healer comp? we just seen 2 keys done with a 4 dps comp
[0:42:50] vratko18: yess is boring is true
[0:42:51] Chrissy1337: @frozenalphaa so you just like TGP more than MDI
[0:42:53] Raggu2: most sports are kinda boring. also thats a thing
[0:43:01] frastly: MDI is fine but 3 days are way too much for what is happening
[0:43:01] urchinlo: fuck around and let me find out a way to run a key in 10 mins. im lucky to get in and out within an hour with some of these pugs xD
[0:43:10] nastye: @meozart higher is irrelevant to the MDI, only care about faster
[0:43:13] vratko18: i love watch skiing like slalom giant slalom…
[0:43:25] Zir_aus: @Naguura did u see the 'boring' comments on the raider io post/wow post? people saying its boring cos the boys are top 'AGAIN'
[0:43:25] FrozenAlphaa: why are they not doing +2 with whole dungeon pull then if its all about speed run
[0:43:36] meozart: @nastye how is that true a 4 dps comp was beat by a healer comp
[0:43:38] dnfbowser: mdi should stay mdi i for my persona like tgp more
[0:43:42] Miuuu: you could go down a system where teams can decide on their key level and they get a score depending on key level and time but then its not the easiest to understand who is ahead for the viewers and it then becomes TGPesque

[0:44:01] vratko18: do you like watch hockey ?
[0:44:21] lemmegreen: MDI is good ...its mythic raiding that could use some change
[0:44:23] Sakajaweeya: I thought this MDI has been very entertaining
[0:44:26] nastye: @chandenwow whatever does the best single target will complete the key fastest and will therefore be what you see
[0:44:31] FrozenAlphaa: and i think there should be a class ban as well besides the dungeon ban
[0:44:34] stickchip: TGP as standard would be great. As that's what all the players practice every day
[0:44:57] FrozenAlphaa: if there is a class ban we can see more class diversity as well
[0:45:01] nastye: @FrozenAlphaa too much time required by the players or resulting in lower quality runs which are much less interesting to watch
[0:45:02] Firmace: I like TGP, but maaan it's really missing an option to let each viewer decide who they want to look at
[0:45:08] Sakajaweeya: class ban would be cool actually
[0:45:12] Miuuu: I would love to see mdi being more  like the qualifiers than the actual mdi event, think them having to come up with strats is a lot more interesting than the actual runs
[0:45:19] Tharsonis: tgp is closer to the everday experience of most players, so i think its more appealing for a lot of people
[0:45:21] Chrissy1337: @lemmegreen what would you change about mythic raiding?
[0:45:25] dethbybunnies: mdi this weekend was amazing
[0:45:25] meozart: a larger prize pool would be better also it would bring in more competition I feel. I maybe wrong
[0:45:25] MBG_95: this was one of the highest viewed cup weekends right?

[0:45:52] radicaL3i: @meozart its already like $260k for MDI total, with $80k first prize
[0:45:58] Raggu2: Soccer is hella boring. but nearly all sports are.
[0:45:59] highoncaffe1ne: I love TGP and MDI and AWC but whats in my opinion missing is a regular 10v10 pvp Event
[0:46:06] lemmegreen: i would have open Mythic raid lockouts
[0:46:13] lemmegreen: from week 1
[0:46:18] Sakajaweeya: when Legendary came out the gate and went all the way to Princess A. i got chills
[0:46:18] loonartix: Never watching it before, but if you have been doing keys ever i think its pretty fun and interesting to watch xD
[0:46:21] Firmace: TGP just needs an option for a viewer to choose witch team they want to see
[0:46:26] famib: I would love a battleground comp
[0:46:28] chriasp91: A class ban would be amazing, just to see more diversity and reward multispec players

[0:46:57] meozart: they would get a tax write off. count it as a lose

[0:47:12] gfvaris: @Naguura a lot more ppl watching both since its back on twitch and co-streaming also

[0:47:34] gfvaris: @Naguura most sports get more viewers if one team is dominant tho
[0:47:34] onewidit: People in the 90's also said it was boring that Michael Jordan and the Bulls won every year too haha
[0:47:35] PedjaSenpai: what you think about seed 1 team "losing" and just speeding through lower bracket to finals?
[0:47:39] nastye: echo always has cool strats at least, they don’t just do 30% more damage

[0:49:20] itsClubby: honesdtly I wouldnt mind not play american football ever its low key the most boring sport of all time
[0:49:23] AceReformed: Hello caro, hello chat naguuraSwole
[0:49:29] AceReformed: How are you doing today
[0:49:35] Hodacia: There is a lot of people who have played MDI for a long time other than echo tho, but they haven't stayed together like echo has :)
[0:49:40] meozart: I don’t get that logic what would blizzard get from hosting a 2 million dollar mdi  they make billions and that 2 million would be a clear tax write off
[0:49:47] lemmegreen: except that wow pve is rigged and drive on ... play pvp if want something that looks like esport
[0:49:47] Chrissy1337: @itsclubby that would be baseball
[0:50:03] lemmegreen: accept*
[0:50:15] itsClubby: @Chrissy1337 PepeLaugh
[0:50:35] Raggu2: @meozart You certainly dont profit by just throwing money away. mdi is fairly unpopular in the grand scheme of things.
[0:50:46] Lonck23: !hero
[0:50:46] StreamElements: My first impression on the new 11.0 hero talents -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkgDhs5J20Q
[0:50:49] Chrissy1337: @meozart what would they gain from putting that much money into it
[0:50:56] y0rge: cus you gain exp
[0:51:03] lemmegreen: i have the solution
[0:51:31] Clush___: @Naguura it would probably be less practice required if live keys were closer to what they are doing in MDI but they are just totally opposite
[0:51:36] Zir_aus: dont let that guy do his own taxed
[0:51:39] warryvibe: angy
[0:52:02] Kuroz: pepePHONE @warryvibe
[0:52:03] PedjaSenpai: what you think about seed 1 team "losing" and just speeding through lower bracket to finals?
[0:52:13] warryvibe: @Kuroz pepePHONER
[0:52:14] dnfbowser: its not free money hahaha
[0:52:26] itsClubby: thats why companies give to charity sio they can write it off
[0:52:33] Sneetz1: You get it cheaper, that's all
[0:52:35] dnfbowser: stil paying 500k
[0:52:41] TynrionTV: @itsClubby That is a US thing
[0:52:44] meozart: ? what lol
[0:52:54] Utinis: So your telling me I don’t have to throw out 10% of my salary each month? naguuraOMEGALUL
[0:52:55] Xendera5: Xendera5 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[0:52:58] meozart: a community event is a investment
[0:52:59] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[0:53:13] Nokin02: clearly 0 is better Kappa
[0:53:14] bossenkt: @Utinis 10% luxuary
[0:53:30] Kuroz: mic
[0:53:31] Raggu2: Rip
[0:53:32] onewidit: muted
[0:53:33] TynrionTV: More attention = more ROI
[0:53:34] Raggu2: LUL
[0:53:35] Kuroz: and back
[0:53:36] meozart: lol what
[0:53:40] Zir_aus: mic mic
[0:53:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[0:53:47] Jens_JBMedia: Greetings naguuraSip
[0:53:56] harrybps: ur mic cut out mid sentence
[0:53:57] Raggu2: You legitimately went silent for like 6 seconds
[0:54:04] jennikarp2: your mic cut out when you were explaining
[0:54:25] TheHunter90: !hero
[0:54:25] StreamElements: My first impression on the new 11.0 hero talents -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkgDhs5J20Q
[0:54:35] Raggu2: Zoidbergs give me 5 meme
[0:54:56] Raethus_WoW: I think they need to introduce a random element to MDI like extra affix that only comes on play during the match to spice things up xD
[0:55:10] lemmegreen: blizzard would do better to own the esport comps on its game for sure...
[0:55:12] dnfbowser: not worth
[0:55:33] lemmegreen: the current situation alienates its players
[0:55:35] dnfbowser: in  this case its not worth i guess
[0:55:40] Raggu2: cant mr microsoft just supply all the money now
[0:55:56] Raggu2: slootRoll
[0:56:03] meozart: so just keep all the money you make and do nothing for tax write offs?
[0:56:03] onewidit: A bigger purse brings more eyes, which in the long run will build more revenue.
[0:56:11] itsClubby: I make money and throw mine away Sadge
[0:56:16] myguyhood: if them throwing a little extra means their players stay subscribed because of the nice gesture then maybe it does work
[0:56:18] hydraponix: amazon and netflix did that for many years
[0:56:22] Insivius: Hi Naguura, You have unspent Profession Specialization Knowledge.
[0:56:26] onewidit: I think it's a short term vs. long term thing.
[0:56:43] meozart: clearly
[0:56:43] itsClubby: NOTED
[0:56:47] Kaelangg: people who have never done their taxes think tax write offs are the be all and end all it's insane
[0:56:47] lemmegreen: ya the people that have been thinking about this just got fired
[0:56:49] gfvaris: I honestly do not think a bigger purse for this would bring in more money for blizz xD
[0:56:49] Raggu2: microvision
[0:56:57] onewidit: NERDS!
[0:56:57] RazaDazza: @xXPapaShoXx  The people watching mdi are likely people who already play the game not new players. Wow esports is too hard for new players to understand.
[0:57:06] EvercideTV: Always baffles me how people on the internet always spit out random stupid sh*t and when they are confronted with facts, arguments and knowledge their anwer is "lol what"
[0:57:13] lemmegreen: daddy bill gates will fix it
[0:57:22] meozart: I understand now you explained it so well thank you
[0:57:28] itsClubby: naguuraQuickmaths
[0:57:45] FrozenAlphaa: i think money isnt issue but we need competition enough about echo and i think they should ban class as well so that there is more class diversity
[0:57:45] RazaDazza: they closed OW esports because it wasn’t worth it for the profits it makes not because they hate the players
[0:57:47] urchinlo: turns out theyre just spreading cheerios on a table and spreading them out evenly to calc these numbers
[0:57:48] lemmegreen: its not an esport
[0:57:49] XaturesRTB: Fortnite lmao
[0:57:55] Zir_aus: 2023blkizzard revenue 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, .... 2million is a drop in the ocean. it wont affect much lol. this guy :D
[0:57:56] lemmegreen: its  a cult
[0:58:04] meozart: thanks for the explanation. sorry I got you fired up
[0:58:13] NYKO7_: if Blizzard was private company it could work like that but not as public company with investors
[0:58:14] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[0:58:51] lemmegreen: seeing that the CEO got fired i thing change is in the wind
[0:58:54] frastly: they should pay players with ingame tokens
[0:58:55] Tastycheese: why doesnt blizzard have more sponsors to advertise during the events? Wouldnt that make it more profitable
[0:58:55] Kaelangg: tbh without seeing the finances and ROIs we cant even comment on if it would or wouldnt be beneficial to them tbf
[0:58:58] XaturesRTB: na for they doing afine with the for there one game
[0:59:03] Raggu2: having the though process that throwing away 2 million away on something so inconsequential *just* cause them kae 2 billion is why you arent making these decisions.
[0:59:16] Zir_aus: when is naguura making a dream team to smoke echo? when when when
[0:59:22] Kulamog: @Tastycheese advertiseres need to be interested in advertising there first LUL
[0:59:30] chriasp91: They make so much money so they can pay parachutes to all the top leaders they are switiching out all the time
[0:59:38] gfvaris: @Naguura is it the most watched blizz activ microsoft esport ?
[0:59:55] lemmegreen: ya
[0:59:57] Kulamog: @gfvaris CoD is probably bigger than wow esports
[0:59:57] Skyle_win: the problem is, that wow pvp is very unique compared to every other 3v3 or 5v5 game
[1:00:08] NYKO7_: rwf has too much degeneracy to be official
[1:00:08] gfvaris: @Kulamog you sure ?
[1:00:08] FrozenAlphaa: do u know top 3 vdh mains use bait gear so people dont copy their gears
[1:00:22] lemmegreen: you could make more money by unlocking Mythic Raid lockouts
[1:00:28] Zir_aus: the rwf needs global release for this.
[1:00:44] kaspagre: Tractionn
[1:00:44] MBG_95: marketing
[1:00:45] 6NEZ9: increasing the prize pool will not increase the views that much more than what it would already have.
[1:00:46] Kulamog: @gfvaris not 100%, just what i encounter on social media. I dont play CoD and get tweets, videos about it.
[1:00:46] shad3dspectr3: to sell the game
[1:00:47] Firmace: Is there enough "top players" to event change the result ever?
[1:00:50] RazaDazza: if blizzard turn the RWF into a blizzard sponsored event it would ruin it
[1:00:55] meozart: @naguura thanks for explaining I do apologize for firing you up
[1:01:06] ni_pa_tv: @naguura boomi need 20+ keys for doing dmg or?
[1:01:11] Xendera5: rwf is a guild event not a blizzard event like mdi tgp or awc
[1:01:16] Krenzic: Naguura is schooling chat so hard rn. Lol
[1:01:29] frastly: When they do tournament server for RWF it will be start of an esport
[1:01:32] zebino: Is too small players platform in blizzard. You only see the same people in MDI, TGP and WF
[1:01:34] MBG_95: they just win its great for them
[1:01:43] chriasp91: RWF wouldnt work as an official event cus blizzard cant tune for shit
[1:01:49] lemmegreen: and it annoys the player base
[1:01:51] Justin_893: Money for E-Sports(donating) but SOD servers are laggy for weeks now
[1:02:02] badathur: they can only lose if they do it
[1:02:09] Zir_aus: RWF wouldnt work. if NA smokes it in 5 days like sark then its a big flop
[1:02:19] myguyhood: would alot more guilds compete for money? probably = ALOT more eyes
[1:02:21] BravoSector: @meozart its ok she looks great fired up
[1:02:25] Kulamog: Every games company has a different philosophy for that. Riot organizes all of their own epsorts by themselves
[1:02:31] Redzzza: at the Maximum, good pun
[1:02:35] Kulamog: Valve on the other hand only does the International
[1:02:43] Artheeri: PepeLaugh last time they touched it, Sepulcher happened
[1:02:44] StephixOne: @Naguura now tells us about global release
[1:02:50] StephixOne: tell* even
[1:02:54] lemmegreen: they are cutting out middle management
[1:02:57] Xendera5: blizz esports mdi, tgp awc (3v3 and 5v5) and rbg and let’s go 😂😂
[1:02:58] saintnutricious: can they put it on a tournament server or something? splits are so boring
[1:03:04] RazaDazza: @myguyhood wow esports are essentially unwatchable to people who haven’t played wow
[1:03:15] Petrcyrner: What do you think about the legendary acquirement system. Im a mythic raider and have been doing HC fyrakk since week  1 + get all possible lesser embers every week and still dont have the axe :D
[1:03:24] BunnyOnMeth: Tuning of dungeons and raids are actually quite nice this season.... But still wtf VDH please nerf
[1:03:29] StephixOne: @Petrcyrner skill issue
[1:03:29] EvercideTV: i would just love to see more guilds with financial back up, so the competition gets more fair @Naguura
[1:03:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:03:49] stickchip: there would need to be enough for good money for top 5
[1:03:52] th3janitor: would you rather raiding and m+ stayed the way it currently is with the need for addons? or would you rather see it go back similar to classic and tbc?
[1:03:55] radicaL3i: another reason we need 10 man raiding so RWF can get bigger
[1:04:04] StephixOne: £1M
[1:04:08] throwmasterlol: legit free to keep it as is and it stays organic
[1:04:08] Kolomito1: A months wow subscription
[1:04:10] lemmegreen: who wants to see the same teams get padded GS every season but running slits
[1:04:15] kaspagre: Blizz shouldn't care about how many people there are in guild above the 20 raiders
[1:04:17] thesirganks: ye it wouldnt be worth it for most people who are not already competing since they wouldnt win anyway
[1:04:28] lemmegreen: it was cute the first few times
[1:04:33] myguyhood: well they get nohting right now and theres already so much competing? so money would only be more incentive?
[1:04:35] lemmegreen: but its getting old
[1:04:35] StreamElements: SHUT THE FUCK UP, I'M NOT OLD naguuraSassy
[1:04:44] zebino: Imagine G2, Faze and Cloud9 making guilds. how are they going to find 30+ people Xd
[1:04:46] Xendera5: how many players working for playing wow and how many plays wow to make money(stramer)?
[1:04:47] Krenzic: Even if it was $1,000,000 split between 30 people.. Not a wage they could live off of.. Not worth teams putting in that much effort.
[1:04:56] Goldnuggetmcrichboy: it prob would only work effectivly as in like dota2 with a battlepass that upgrades the pricepool and also gives the company more money
[1:05:14] Kuroz: !marker blizzard handling rwf talk
[1:05:19] lemmegreen: unlock raid logouts ... make a prize pool and see what happens
[1:05:20] MBG_95: @lemmegreen and yet it was one of the highest viewed RWF ever
[1:05:23] RazaDazza: @goldnuggetmcrichboy they tried that once for awc and kept half the money. we don’t want that
[1:05:31] myguyhood: the odds of them winning arent that bad, alot of guilds get the first kills on first 5-6 bosses so with the extra effort for the gain of money then maybe there would be more chance
[1:05:43] kaspagre: Why wouldn't another guild be competitive to the top 3 if they had the same amount of staff doing a lot of prep work for them?
[1:05:51] Vertigo_GB: Both blizzard and the orgz will loose money
[1:05:53] BunnyOnMeth: Like Liquid litterally has a person that makes them custom weakauras... How can you compéte with that
[1:06:08] viinQ: get guild tabars with commercials lel
[1:06:11] bossenkt: do you get paid when you are a part of these broadcasts?
[1:06:20] StephixOne: @BunnyOnMeth You can't, that's why Liquid won Kappa
[1:06:32] lemmegreen: Loyde Christmas effect is huge..."so you  are saying there is a chance"
[1:06:36] StephixOne: Oh I thought it was pro bono
[1:06:41] gfvaris: blizz scam crowd founding
[1:06:42] StephixOne: ExpOSuRe
[1:07:01] lemmegreen: ya
[1:07:05] Caidrox: @myguyhood the odds are beyond 0
[1:07:06] Kaelangg: they do that because main raids do splits and get boosted by gold
[1:07:11] BravoSector: @naguura millionaire cconfirmed
[1:07:12] chriasp91: How would Blizz even handling a RWF ofificially if they cant even get a even playingfield with the resets
[1:07:26] lemmegreen: the first boss is getting to split raids
[1:07:32] Petrcyrner: those guild are sweating the bosses like crazy and when echo and liquid are done they one shot everythin
[1:07:34] Seronem0: They should include ffa tournaments with ingame rewards split into different tiers
[1:07:41] lemmegreen: take that away  and see what happens
[1:07:43] milorgpvp: MDI global finals was 300k pricepool, 120k went to Echo. Thats 24k (dollars) per player. For a RWF event to have the same earnings per player, the winning pool would have to be 720k, with a total pricepool of 1.8 million USD (assuming 30man rosters)
[1:07:43] Kulamog: it would be more interesting for a RWF esports if they did 1 boss or 2 boss raids
[1:07:45] trollinmyimp: You touched a nerve guys...lol
[1:07:50] Kulamog: like crucible
[1:07:51] Kaelangg: I'd be echo and liquid in a race to the fridge
[1:07:54] WeaselMuffin: except myst*
[1:07:54] Kaelangg: beat
[1:07:56] BunnyOnMeth: @stephixone I think Écho has one person too
[1:08:05] StephixOne: Looking at how bad OWL and the HOTS scene were, I don't want Blizz organising more esports tbh
[1:08:13] myguyhood: yeah but the other guilds couldnt care about getting last boss world first so the effort isnt there, but if the effort was there then i think the compete would be high
[1:08:14] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[1:08:19] Kuroz: Tssk @WeaselMuffin
[1:08:19] kaspagre: On top of what I said, other guilds don't get the helpers for splits which is in a way cheating if u consider there is a hint of p2w cause helpers come for gold?
[1:08:39] Petrcyrner: im a Mythic RL and the ammount of prep and testing they have to do and all the theorycrafting is absolutely insane . New guild can never ever match that. truly insane the ammount of effor that gets put into RWF
[1:08:49] Driney: Im learning alot about RWF from chat BeerTime
[1:08:49] Clush___: talking about money Bedge
[1:08:49] BunnyOnMeth: Also Meeres is spreadsheet overlord
[1:09:01] StephixOne: @Driney You're welcome
[1:09:06] chriasp91: Only way to have a RFW - It would have to be on a tournament realm without outside help for splits etc
[1:09:07] aarodis: mdi more popular of world first.
[1:09:07] kaspagre: I'm not saying they are winning because of that but they get even more of an edge compared to other guilds
[1:09:07] mika01: @Driney same
[1:09:14] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD.
[1:09:16] radicaL3i: RWF cant be esport without TR either tbh
[1:09:21] RazaDazza: @driney geniuses in chat
[1:09:22] keijihanda: no split allowed EZ
[1:09:30] WeaselMuffin: @radicaL3i fat lol
[1:09:35] Caidrox: i think people rly gotta let go of the idea wow being a esport game when its clearly not relevant in esports
[1:09:36] thesirganks: ye like a level on a tournament realm and finish a raid in hardcore mode or smt
[1:09:37] radicaL3i: 🟨
[1:09:43] trollinmyimp: lmfao the fact people think Microsoft has any interest in e sports.
[1:09:45] lemmegreen: all they have to do is make it so you cant do splits and the problem will resolve it self
[1:09:56] saintnutricious: something like that charity race could work for a tournament
[1:09:56] loonartix: might also look pretty bad if Blizzard hosted the race and potentially scuffed tuning of bosses, sheesh
[1:10:03] Petrcyrner: What do you think about the legendary acquirement system. Im a mythic raider and have been doing HC fyrakk since week  1 + get all possible lesser embers every week and still dont have the axe :D
[1:10:04] StephixOne: sheeeeeesh
[1:10:08] MBG_95: @trollinmyimp they spend plenty of money in other game esports ???
[1:10:34] myguyhood: rwf splits are boring
[1:10:37] Kolomito1: @lemmegreen Sounds like a pretty hard thing lol, and top guilds would still find a way to farm some shit to make themselves better
[1:10:41] Kulamog: A crucible like 2 boss raid would be the only good way for a RWF esports IMO
[1:10:43] Driney: sepulcher affixes for each boss was pretty fun
[1:10:51] kaspagre: I'm just addressing ur point when you said other guilds have no chance against echo or liquid. Not at this format, when the top 2 get funnel gear. staff that does all prep for them etc.
[1:10:55] BunnyOnMeth: Max said it could be possible for guilds like Instant Dollars to win Fated season 4 RWF with just pure skills
[1:10:57] PedjaSenpai: @Petrcyrner i have 2, got 1st week 7 2nd on alt dropped week 9, so just get it? XD
[1:11:00] Lowruks: what are thoses headsets you are using ?
[1:11:03] MBG_95: @Driney first person POV was legit hilarious
[1:11:12] Kuroz: !headset
[1:11:12] StreamElements: Alienware AW920H Wireless Headset
[1:11:13] aarodis: mdi or world race the run got to be more exiting.always same team win poeple tired to see echo win everithing
[1:11:18] saintnutricious: week 1 mythic raiding very relatable
[1:11:25] Kaelangg: people still on wotlk KEKW
[1:11:42] bossenkt: muppets in classic do speed racing in super easy raid content
[1:11:46] spjrit: blizz should do something like MDI with raid - inviting some guilds and let them rush a clearrun vs each other nad do do something diff the bosses should have one specialattack added
[1:11:49] th3janitor: @Kaelangg because it was peak wow
[1:12:00] Kaelangg: @th3janitor key word being was
[1:12:09] Kaelangg: nostalgia >
[1:12:10] StephixOne: I think the race would be more fun if the raids were still hard, like pre-Cata
[1:12:13] Tronnx1: !hero
[1:12:13] StreamElements: My first impression on the new 11.0 hero talents -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkgDhs5J20Q
[1:12:20] onewidit: Broxah is undefeated
[1:12:24] BravoSector: excuse me, no one can play like faker
[1:12:30] wizardbestest: M+ is boring to watch and shouldnt be an E SPORT.  given on  like it wasnt getting any views.
[1:12:40] Kulamog: @StephixOne nice engagement bait Kapp
[1:12:49] BravoSector: GoatEmotey GoatEmotey
[1:12:52] StephixOne: idk why I'm procrastinating work by baiting in here
[1:12:58] th3janitor: @Kaelangg which is why people are still playing, wow has to much elitism and bloat now with addons and 4000 mechanics
[1:12:59] wizardbestest: Blizzard should focus on using PVP as an E SPORT IMO
[1:13:01] retektroll123: @wizardbestest the game is still alive thanks to m+
[1:13:19] mika01: LUL
[1:13:19] jacksplatt: lol
[1:13:19] StephixOne: @wizardbestest Arenas are crazy boring to me though, for example, so
[1:13:22] Stricken79: pallies NODDERS
[1:13:24] NajkPlays: I don't like gear from raids
[1:13:25] Lennerrt: thats so nice
[1:13:25] Atlasdair: Aug evokers :)
[1:13:26] NajkPlays: remove it
[1:13:26] MBG_95: @wizardbestest they do PvP every other weekend wdym
[1:13:26] Petrcyrner: What do you think about the legendary acquirement system. Im a mythic raider and have been doing HC fyrakk since week  1 + get all possible lesser embers every week and still dont have the axe :D
[1:13:27] 6NEZ9: live strea?
[1:13:29] throwmasterlol: remove mounts

[1:13:41] wizardbestest: No, I didnt say I didnt like to watch it. When I popped in to see what was happening in the MDI it was literally only 15 k people watching on twitch compared to lets say other things
[1:13:43] TheHunter90: M+ is boring to do from 20+, most people do it for content
[1:13:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:13:49] wizardbestest: Its just boring
[1:13:49] trollinmyimp: OOOHHH she's got her sassy pants on
[1:13:53] Xendera5: @stephixone it’s harder when blizz remove the loot lockout and go to strict instances lockout
[1:13:53] mickeman92: hey, sup?
[1:13:58] jacksplatt: the bottom of her coffee mug, should be here is a quarter, call someone who cares
[1:14:02] Goldnuggetmcrichboy: remove solar beam <.< (and give good spell lul)
[1:14:18] Burnprof: would you please ask John Blizzard to remove PVP?
[1:14:25] kaspagre: @WeaselMuffin You can not do it?
[1:14:25] MBG_95: pretty sure it peaked at about 30k + youtube 10k+ PLUS like 50k viewers in watch partys
[1:14:33] mickeman92: was just a few sec over timeing Throne+25 xD
[1:14:36] fennrirq: @Naguura btw your MDI cast was legit as always, gj! SeemsGood
[1:14:37] jacksplatt: i try to invest at least 200 a month for my retirement, i think that is enough
[1:14:43] mickeman92: unfortunate hehe xD
[1:14:46] radicaL3i: yeah fuckin get m naguge
[1:14:48] onewidit: Twitch is owned by Amazon, so we're all going to go to space with Bezos someday
[1:14:49] BravoSector: bring ninja to play wow
[1:15:01] gfvaris: I think it was around 100k when you add everything up
[1:15:03] Petrcyrner: its 50 k for one stream but there are so many . Echo Max Liquid Gingi MEthod etc.
[1:15:08] gfvaris: witch is very VERY good
[1:15:22] Stricken79: @xXPapaShoXx nah he'll sod off with all the chicks and nuke from orbit
[1:15:26] Cyppz: this was my first time watching mdi and it was fkn hype
[1:15:32] onewidit: That's because you're smart lol
[1:15:43] aarodis: team investe a lot a time and money in tournement to have small price.league have good price to winner
[1:15:46] gfvaris: Counter strike is the king of that so many ppl watch it that dont play it for years
[1:15:50] Hemenia: Hey naguura sorry to report I did in fact get my boomkin rolling again and it's been fun to play it
[1:15:53] Kaelangg: mdi this weekend somehow brought me back... to sod (first time)
[1:15:54] Cyppz: when legendary made their first  pull in ad, that was wild
[1:15:55] fennrirq: @Naguura btw MDI competition is easy enought to understand, people see the boss health bars, see the timer, that's all we need, it's very watchable for casuals
[1:15:58] BravoSector: @xXPapaShoXx very
[1:16:37] frastly: it is not only what Blizz is making, but also ppl like Naguura can milk it after with this talk, so it is priceless
[1:16:53] StephixOne: wait what the hell is that cursed run on her Details
[1:17:12] gfvaris: omg 3 moonkins
[1:17:25] Clush___: the observer couldnt even figure out what echo was doing on rise until the 2nd time they did it LOL
[1:17:26] onewidit: I think AWC is easier to understand
[1:17:26] StephixOne: they're filthy irl people
[1:17:33] onewidit: PVP is inherently easier
[1:17:35] BunnyOnMeth: The easiest esports to watch is rocket league
[1:17:43] jarilrpg: my gf understands video gaming, and she understands the MDI
[1:17:46] gfvaris: @Naguura I watched the MDI before starting to play retail and had no idea about the dungs
[1:17:51] saintnutricious: isn't RWF the same there? if you don't understand the game it's just a health bar going down
[1:17:54] jarilrpg: she doesnt play WoW
[1:18:05] Cyppz: @xXPapaShoXx lol sure
[1:18:05] razen_95: yep, my buddy who mostly plays PvP, doesnt understand MDI :D

[1:18:18] Kolomito1: Big true
[1:18:22] Clush___: @saintnutricious yes but RWF is doing a raid the same way we do it in live but better, the mdi is fundamentally different game mode than pushing keys on live
[1:18:24] aarodis: mdi more easy to lern of the raiding is too log and to hard for nothing.les 10% raid mythic
[1:18:25] Kolomito1: I can't watch MDI if I'm not up to date with the current dungeons
[1:18:28] keijihanda: imagine trying understanding rise portal tech KEKW
[1:18:29] fennrirq: @Naguura I run 24+ keys and still don't know what the hell we are doing tbh KEKHeim KEKHeim
[1:18:29] liviu_81: ellyyBearNOTED
[1:18:35] Xendera5: map overlay for the dungeon
[1:18:41] NorthOfRapture: @jarilrpg one example doesn't make a rule
[1:18:50] Xendera5: then the viewer knows where there are
[1:18:55] adalexxx: Thats why you have casters, to explain what's going on for newer audiences lmfao
[1:18:55] lemmegreen: as soon as the MDI start pugging keys gets stupid because tanks monkey see monkey die (ingame)
[1:19:05] Aryndis: Aryndis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:19:14] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[1:19:20] Petrcyrner: What do you think about the legendary acquirement system. Im a mythic raider and have been doing HC fyrakk since week  1 + get all possible lesser embers every week and still dont have the axe :D
[1:19:34] MonzyGames: no speedrun is understandable until you play that game yourself
[1:19:42] nash25pl: what casters dont want to babysit us  that just rude Smadge
[1:19:47] censiGFY: YO nagura wassup wassup
[1:19:57] adalexxx: You said they can't u dertsand how close it is, that's where casters come in wot...
[1:20:10] aarodis: world first to complicated and to long
[1:20:27] fennrirq: @Naguura yeah that's why football is very popular, every idiot can see what's going on, it's just cyberport thing in general is complicated
[1:20:27] StreamElements: Hello Sebleh worryAss
[1:21:02] frastly: when is the next rwf?
[1:21:17] Demanisraar: Hey all
[1:21:30] fennrirq: @Naguura take league of legends, it has a ton of viewers but the main beauty of the game is in timings, wave management and cds which are not visible to casuals
[1:21:33] jonimage: race to world first is super viewer unfriendly with all the splits and mplus grinds for like the first 4 to 5 days its actually really bad for viewers in general @Naguura
[1:21:35] lemmegreen: RTWF is entertaining but i think it would be better for game if they leveled the playing field on gearing and split into one day a week broadcast
[1:21:48] AlmightyWitchDoctor: legendaries are stupid unless its for moonkin amirite
[1:21:48] Sn3kj: what about legendarys like mop/wod? wod ring was nice imo, quest lines
[1:21:51] Petrcyrner: agreed 100% <3
[1:21:55] Stricken79: I think they are dumb too NODDERS coz the fucking thing won't drop!!!
[1:21:57] Xendera5: that’s why it’s a legendary not al have one 😂
[1:22:01] myguyhood: do you think classes were tuned around having leggo?
[1:22:07] aarodis: players tired to raid,dungeon more fun to do
[1:22:08] lemmegreen: no spits
[1:22:11] Clush___: legendaries that not everyone are able to acquire and use are incredibly stupid
[1:22:30] lemmegreen: that is what is happening
[1:22:44] Ren26: delete raiding
[1:23:10] Xendera5: think about the warglaives or the other legendary not every class and player have them and the farming it for years
[1:23:13] Sn3kj: what about legendarys like mop/wod? wod ring was nice imo, quest lines leges?
[1:23:16] Stricken79: mop and wod had to good kind of leggos, everyone can have it
[1:23:20] marsagoxd: legendaries should be on a questline like MoP, having a random droprate is not good
[1:23:22] Zir_aus: 14 weeks in no leggo haha lets goooooooooo
[1:23:36] Dunedain1305: Why do you think there are downsides?
[1:23:37] shad3dspectr3: this legendary has been the weakest to date, all of the other legendary items were enormous upgrades
[1:23:38] Clush___: the upside is you have a shit base class if the legendary is powerful
[1:23:38] TynrionTV: Leggo is worth it for the Tmog
[1:23:39] keijihanda: imagine grinding for a month to drop the stupid legendary KEKW
[1:23:41] drastaro: yeah, 496 items make no sense :D
[1:23:44] witcherpie: nagura tell ion to stop this nonsense of cross realm mythic raiding being locked until first 100 mythic guild clears, like wtf, we don't like raiding with guilds

[1:23:46] StreamElements: https://www.youtube.com/Naguura
[1:23:48] lemmegreen: id like to see some of these top CE raiders get a chance to show up ... and open mythic raiding to more people
[1:23:49] shad3dspectr3: nope
[1:23:51] BunnyOnMeth: Same, I hate the concept of BiS
[1:23:56] AlmightyWitchDoctor: Ret is op ok
[1:24:04] JohnAllenCasts: I still have my sleeper conspiracy that this 3 expac arc is a move from blizz to release "WoW 2" so could change the game then
[1:24:04] Dreddmar: they do more damage than those who dont have it
[1:24:12] Stricken79: Despairge
[1:24:23] lemmegreen: leggo is only good if you have it
[1:24:24] Stricken79: it's not my lilfe Sadge
[1:24:27] J0kEx: having a legy so bad. they could make a cool transmog chance drop for endboss with an extra questline so alot ppl would do it i think an there is no bad balancing around your class
[1:24:33] JohnAllenCasts: But Caro it's ORANGE what don't you understand
[1:24:34] Ren26: yeah the spec is not special with the legnedary, they are lackign wihtout it
[1:24:42] Dunedain1305: But it shouldn't be like that! It shouldn't be balanced with the leggo it should ne without!
[1:24:42] finnybae: never thought of it that way lmao
[1:24:44] CrippledPenguins: usually they make leggo classes do more than usual dmg with the leggo tho
[1:24:49] aarodis: blizzard got to make like legion one weapon and you do do quest to get transmog for your weapon.class hall got to comeback to
[1:24:55] liviu_81: ellyyBearRage
[1:25:12] frastly: wow was better when it wasn't balanced
[1:25:15] liviu_81: yes Kappa
[1:25:18] JohnAllenCasts: Also tbf the evoker legendary was different, it buffed allies. It was the preaug aug
[1:25:21] lemmegreen: LUL
[1:25:24] Clush___: @Naguura they need to add more complexity to gear until it becomes unsimmable so its actually fun again to gear :)
[1:25:25] drastaro: no everything is about dmg, it gives you more stats
[1:25:28] MontreyOG: Let the chaos rain LUL
[1:25:30] hotsincee91: wtf am i the only 1 who cant log in since last night>
[1:25:36] VipMalis: it will always be somewhat imbalanced, why not have legendary as seasonal perk for some classes
[1:25:41] Dunedain1305: Then why you make a legendary? If it's not powerfull and make the char powerfull? To have a Orange color item?
[1:26:01] Stricken79: @hotsincee91 yeah,m may as well unsub and play last epoch NODDERS
[1:26:08] JohnAllenCasts: I feel like it'd be cool to add a legendary that essentially gives you a PI to put on someone else in the party
[1:26:17] aarodis: legendary coulb be cool like in past time one by server
[1:26:19] jonimage: legendaries being balance is the least of the balancing problems wow faces
[1:26:26] imarswastaken: legendary here, legendary there everyone is just obsessed with it
[1:26:26] y0rge: i feel legends should be like prestige items
[1:26:30] y0rge: not items for all
[1:26:35] imarswastaken: just don't put legendary in the game
[1:26:36] MontreyOG: !hero
[1:26:36] StreamElements: My first impression on the new 11.0 hero talents -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkgDhs5J20Q
[1:26:37] lemmegreen: factz
[1:26:46] radicaL3i: holy shit every plate user just got put in the ground
[1:26:47] liviu_81: so the game  is effed coz of legendaries, in some sort of way? Hmm
[1:26:50] Zir_aus: motivation to play? 14 weeks of no drop. haha
[1:26:50] aarodis: no lengendary nobody gone a raid
[1:26:59] Dunedain1305: I don't remember the warglaives from Illidan beeing balanced with the chars..
[1:27:01] aarodis: raid is dead
[1:27:18] keijihanda: like fyarakk mythic mount KEKW
[1:27:19] aarodis: all players do dungeon more faster
[1:27:19] myguyhood: wanting to play the game doesnt make people stupid tho
[1:27:25] lemmegreen: Amen Thulz vizion was the only good lego
[1:27:26] TynrionTV: There are ppl with the "Insane" title so yes :D
[1:27:32] Clush___: they need to add more complexity to gear until it becomes unsimmable so its actually fun again to gear :)
[1:27:35] JohnAllenCasts: that's 4 months of sub
[1:27:35] Petrcyrner: i main ret ever since Vanilla. It feels super bad espelly since blizz said that they are rewarding excellency in the hard content :D our holy pal has it since week 2 :D :D
[1:27:37] quzulu: everyone expects to get the legendary so its pointless. it only makes sense if its a tiny chance to get it
[1:27:41] ajmb97: Naguura out here cracking the code
[1:27:42] PaWseN9: I think its cool to have special items / legendaries for certain classes, and having that go on rotation. Idk. I think its awesome
[1:27:46] harrybps: I was motivated only after I got the legendary lol, I guess technically motivated to do fyrakk every week 💀
[1:27:47] Skrewdriv3r: @Dunedain1305 glaives where kinda rare tho and not every other player having it
[1:27:49] BunnyOnMeth: Legendaries should be MEGA rare item that is customizable and used in a universal slot like necklace. Or what could be interesting is legendaries embelishment
[1:28:13] Xulu_: I'd like legendaries if they were same ilvl as typical myth track gear, but you could chose the secondaries  or something and it had some novelty effect or on use that wasn't about player power. Then it would still be desirable and could be v rare but not OP.
[1:28:13] Land_ZGZ: I'm sitting here in the backround listening to this like, " yup shes a 100% right" LOL
[1:28:14] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[1:28:17] teamblacklist3d: the problem with all this is it comes down to people wanting to not wanting to put in the work .but want everything for nothing if Lego’s were not easy to obtain and when ya did it set you apart from everyone around you and people get pissed about it
[1:28:26] ajmb97: I was so glad when the legendary was an ax not for evokers
[1:28:30] Zir_aus: anyone remember legion leggos? broooo that was criminal
[1:28:30] Sn3kj: I think wod/mop did it best if there had to be a legendary
[1:28:37] vhev1g: isnt that just legendary items?
[1:28:37] jonimage: SL basically had lego embels
[1:28:38] liviu_81: i remember in legion, in my clan,   the  healer druid  got all but best healing legendary, he was so mad  KEKLEO
[1:28:39] adalexxx: What would you do Instead as a replacement for legos
[1:28:41] vhev1g: we had that
[1:28:44] Dreddmar: no legendary should ever be something you cant see on your character- see BFA
[1:28:52] Petrcyrner: tbh this is still better than legion leggos . As ret i had 2 rly good ones . your guess which 2 i got last :D
[1:28:53] skissmann: Does that really work for people? Having to farm a legendary makes them want to play? Stuff like that only tilts me personally and makes me want to play less tbh
[1:29:05] aarodis: if you remove legendary nobody gone a raid agains
[1:29:09] klinf1: late legion was best, you could both randomly loot them AND farm currency for them
[1:29:10] PaWseN9: Because they're coolk
[1:29:14] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD.
[1:29:23] lemmegreen: legendary should be trinkets only ... that way you dont have to balance melle classes with higher ltem level weapon damage
[1:29:28] Clush___: legendaries are probably fine in a world where we dont only get one single chance at it per week. imagine for a second if you can spam farm it
[1:29:40] JohnAllenCasts: and the shadowlands legendaries
[1:29:50] TynrionTV: Everyone had leggos in Shadowlands
[1:30:08] ghenesis_: Trialing as boomie today in a really good guild , im nervous give me some words of wisdom :D
[1:30:08] DwarfNugget: i'd rather have not special legendaries, than the ones only a handful get
[1:30:16] jonimage: I say break the game and just make every items a legendary item why not
[1:30:19] Petrcyrner: when did you start playing wow btw ?
[1:30:21] DwarfNugget: or no legendaries at all
[1:30:25] Kuroz: !history
[1:30:25] StreamElements: My history in World of Warcraft -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6KcPOniQvQ
[1:30:30] Stricken79: @Naguura how do I stop being the lowest dps warrior oceanic for my ilvl ? Despairge
[1:30:40] adalexxx: What woukd you implement instead of legendaries
[1:30:42] 6NEZ9: branch from WCM is legendary
[1:30:50] BunnyOnMeth: The more I try to think of ways to make legendaries more relevant the more I lean on your side that they're just not meant to be
[1:30:59] PaWseN9: If they for eksample made Frostmourne a legendary for DK's. I think the coolness factor stems from the lore of the sword and not the strength of it in practice.
[1:31:04] Clush___: make regular gear more interesting
[1:31:10] skissmann: It is wildly dependent on what level you play at. Everyone at a high level is required to farm/have it, which just makes it a chore and not the "exciting" drop Blizz says it is
[1:31:14] y0rge: i liked argus trinket
[1:31:18] y0rge: it was gr8 idea
[1:31:33] Petrcyrner: and what do you think about very rare items/trinkets since they feel a little like mini-legendaries
[1:31:51] Burnprof: there she is, point at her, she wants to take your legendary away meeixRiot meeixRiot meeixRiot meeixRiot meeixRiot
[1:32:06] TynrionTV: Gear is just an enabler to do higher end stuff really
[1:32:11] Stricken79: Naguura is trying to get leggos deleted!!! peepoRiot
[1:32:13] Bootygoblinz: Spitting fax
[1:32:22] skissmann: Based take
[1:32:27] lemmegreen: i think super rare should be cosmetic only
[1:32:29] Clush___: imagine you had a stat you can farm for your gear like.. "15% of magic damage is converted to phsycial" now you can try to farm out a set of gear that makes your boomie interact with other classes differently
[1:32:32] BunnyOnMeth: BUT I love my Otto mount!!
[1:32:32] FZKje: 
[1:32:51] skissmann: Just let me go and raid without having to farm super rare stuff
[1:32:55] Darkmumo: for me i like to grind for gear
[1:32:57] penned_apollo: Morning all naguuraLove
[1:33:10] Kuroz: CatDriving @penned_apollo
[1:33:18] Sokkee: last cool item i remeber was the trinket that give you cool looking wings
[1:33:25] ChaosRenown: she also hates unsalted bread from Florence
[1:33:29] waldfennek: what do you think of a M+ Que where u select your Dungeon one higher than you timed and you get qued with random people with your same io? If you leave you get penalties like in Lol but you can vote for surrender if key seems rip
[1:33:33] 6NEZ9: change the icon colour of mythic loot to orange...legendary issue fixed.
[1:33:35] Kuroz: !bread
[1:33:35] Dunedain1305: That means you don't collect anything in the game? Most people play the game and colect some stuff and for me personally it's about estetics when I choose a game.. that's why I play Wow and not FFXIV..
[1:33:35] StreamElements: A friend of mine just told me you once said Italians can't make bread, that our bread is unsalted and tastes like nothing. You probably ate bread once in like Florence where they specifically make unsalted bread and talked shit about the whole country when our bread and baking in general is ages above everyone else. Get more informed before shouting baseless opinions next time 🍞
[1:33:40] trollinmyimp: Nagura fired up this morning
[1:33:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:33:46] PaWseN9: But gear grinding already is "boring" and hasnt change for  a long time, so why do we hate legendaries?
[1:33:48] penned_apollo: LMAO not the breadgate again naguuraOMEGALUL
[1:33:52] quzulu: could make it so rare items alter the cosmetic effects of a skill rather than always power gain
[1:33:53] teamblacklist3d: lol I’m over here running the same dungeon for the 300th time for one piece of gear on a level 14
[1:33:53] WeaselMuffin: except for during the goth stream
[1:33:56] Darkmumo: it is like cheating in single player games i remember playing gta 3 without cheats for a long time but when i started using cheat codes i got bored so easy
[1:33:59] skissmann: Some grind is fine, like farming WM for Branch and stuff. Thats repeatable to and you can spend a few hours/days to just grind it. Super Rare/Legendary stuff isnt which is stupid
[1:34:10] Krenzic: Chat is gaslighting Naguura
[1:34:24] Vtal: How many mounts you got???
[1:34:25] witty95: wrong is just a variant of right :)
[1:34:35] stinqonator5000: some options for ppl that don't raid would be nice. waiting on 1 weekly cache rng for the top mythic gear feels shit
[1:34:40] vhev1g: transmog-wise WoW has little to offer for collecting unfortunately
[1:34:48] kingkhiri: when does the next season starts?
[1:34:49] keijihanda: i like collect gold in wow turn to bnet balance and spend all in in warcraft rumble :D
[1:34:51] Dunedain1305: I'm not saying you are wrong or anything just saying my opinion.. different reasons to play the same game..
[1:34:55] Kaelangg: the first mount being AoA - not a collector KEKW
[1:34:56] AceReformed: I love caro's rant speeches tbh, half of them are totally true, and the others are super cooked lvlySip pgeKEK
[1:34:56] vhev1g: most appearances suck..
[1:35:07] WeaselMuffin: yeah cuz youve spent so much time learning and gearing nagony
[1:35:27] Vtal: You need to pump up those numbers gurl
[1:35:32] Tarzo302: april first
[1:35:33] BravoSector: Play another class next season :P
[1:35:35] harrybps: will fated have cross-realm mythic right from the get go?

[1:38:17] jarilrpg: end of march most likely
[1:38:21] Vtal: S4 is a giga pass
[1:38:23] skyesarrow: no ptr comes when 10.2.6 comes out
[1:38:32] myguyhood: they confirmed no ptr for it i think
[1:38:53] Binek123: S4 is going to be a blast , with fated raids coming back!
[1:38:58] drastaro: boomkin is boring in general :D
[1:39:03] th3janitor: do you even like the game? :D
[1:39:03] jarilrpg: @myguyhood they said no PTR for thepatch, but they will have PTR for the S4 stuff
[1:39:29] Sokkee: why did priest dont got a interrupt or silince yet on the general tree?
[1:39:29] Ziami: I think its gonna feel really bad loosing this tier 2 set bonus as balance
[1:39:33] chriasp91: Fated raids is a lazy way of making content and just trying to say they do anything
[1:39:39] Petrcyrner: DF are awesome i just absolutely hated Shadowmoon and neltharion lair
[1:39:43] berzoz_: so only DF dungeons? in s4
[1:39:55] skyesarrow: are we getting all the DF dungeons again how boring I hope the remove the mega dungeon in S
[1:39:55] AlmightyWitchDoctor: ready for rlp to be insanely hard at the start and it needing nerfs again woo
[1:39:58] chrisshockerx: Hello. Happy to see you on. Hope you are more than well.
[1:40:01] jarilrpg: fated raids/season is better than a year in S3
[1:40:21] myguyhood: we do have dawn next season i thought?
[1:40:23] beldemort25: Noooooo.. My cheat death trinket is gone then
[1:40:25] Zilvaan: Atal is nice
[1:40:25] TynrionTV: So we will have the portals already at the start of the season then? Gonna feel a bit wierd
[1:40:26] hiimcusz: I liked academy from this expansion - even though it was tough :D
[1:40:29] ajmb97: this seasons tuning was so bad
[1:40:33] chriasp91: BRH is the only cool dungeon this season
[1:40:36] hunnieplss: atal is the best tho
[1:40:41] harrybps: waycrest has a sick theme going on, probably why a lot of people like it
[1:40:42] Sokkee: what would be your BIS dungeon pool?
[1:40:43] penned_apollo: lol but its so quirky in waycrest lol
[1:40:45] Binek123: Atal is the worst , even waycrest is better
[1:40:47] skissmann: I remembered Waycrest way worse from BfA tbh
[1:40:50] skissmann: Used to hate it
[1:40:51] drastaro: fall is great
[1:40:59] ChaosRenown: those are the same people that liked sanguine depths
[1:40:59] skyesarrow: waycrest manor and AD are the best dungeons this season easy
[1:41:00] yiannisjk: Atal is good? Have you played it on a 28+ on tyrannical xd
[1:41:01] keijihanda: best dungeon is tides KEKW
[1:41:05] Vtal: I love Everbloom so Cool
[1:41:08] ophelx: dht worst of them all
[1:41:19] Petrcyrner: im not a big fan of halls of infusion but otherwise DF is pog
[1:41:23] jwillhue: my favorite part about AD is you go to the boss first
[1:41:23] hiimcusz: Everbloom would be so good if slashers didnt have affixes :D
[1:41:30] vhev1g: dragonflight dungeons minus megadungeon for s4 pls
[1:41:30] sigmalios: rise best dungeon design ever!!!
[1:41:36] yiannisjk: Yazma is unplayable for 80% of classes if you get soulrend + wrecking pain
[1:41:47] Sokkee: Motherload Bis dungeon Kapp
[1:41:52] silentkillervgc: S2 DF dungeons were awful
[1:41:54] AceReformed: LMAOOO
[1:41:56] Zilvaan: Just play warlock and you are fine @yiannisjk
[1:42:11] silentkillervgc: like 6/8 dungeons needed priest to be playable
[1:42:18] flotmmo: do you think we will see some mythic+ changes regarding season 4? especially in terms of affixes
[1:42:55] yiannisjk: They can survive it once, but it can happen on you 3 times straight. In BRH last boss, you know that if you get shadow bolted, you are never gonna be targeted again
[1:42:58] Thoreya: i may have to skip s4...i cant do halls of infusion or ulda or neltharus again LUL
[1:43:12] radicaL3i: they can fix a lot of dungeons by just not having huge personal mechanics go on same person back to back
[1:43:25] skyesarrow: brh last boss is easy as sounds like boomie issue
[1:43:36] lemmegreen: barkskin ,renew/ bear form frenzy gen /die
[1:43:37] PaWseN9: Gitgud LUL
[1:43:41] Mudrine: hi nagura, do you know how a healer should think about stat diminish ? should you avoid the penalties or just keep stackign your "bis" stats?

[1:44:03] keijihanda: boonkim life KEKW
[1:44:04] GGmaterial: bear form every 6s for throne of the tides totem boss for 75% of the fight LUL
[1:44:11] FauniB: yazma is objectively easier
[1:44:21] qda__: if you’re near form aren’t you in that phase longer too? which means more one shot lol
[1:44:22] Vtal: Is There a correlation between EB 1st boss in tyra 28+ and artitris ?
[1:44:26] qda__: in*
[1:44:26] penned_apollo: just equipt your cheat death trinkets everyone XD
[1:44:34] gfvaris: get 30% vers ez

[1:45:22] Getgudgg: true stat value
[1:45:29] Hemenia: it's the dratnos addon tip, some people only swear by that addon now it's BAD
[1:45:31] silentkillervgc: outlaw rogue want vers on like every slots
[1:45:31] tmAwkward: they added some kind of stat drs after bfa
[1:45:43] gfvaris: the only cap I know of right now in the game is frost mage crit cap..
[1:46:05] gfvaris: and its still not really a hard cap
[1:46:08] Nyx18: is it possible to escape 3.3k in pugs? 25/26s are like 1 timed key per day if I'm lucky atm
[1:46:27] silentkillervgc: I know enh shaman want 6800 haste / mastery rating then they can pump crit / vers
[1:46:49] OlaF_oo: there is but ok
[1:46:51] jarilrpg: just sim yo self
[1:46:52] MooniexVibes: what are we chatting about lovely people?
[1:46:55] xygblarbinn: how are you in flight form in valdrakken
[1:47:00] razen_95: me sitting on 32% haste / 92% mastery on my enhancer :D
[1:47:05] silentkillervgc: @Hemenia i am enh shaman main and i simmed myself
[1:47:09] Kuroz: pathfinder achievement @xygblarbinn
[1:47:17] xygblarbinn: ahhh
[1:47:18] qda__: isn’t there like class discords that will say what stats you should cap?
[1:47:21] FauniB: @razen_95 92 is overcapping ye?
[1:47:35] y0rge: they have
[1:47:44] silentkillervgc: @razen_95 92% is overcap, sim will tell you to get more crit / vers
[1:47:47] DwarfNugget: oh no, you have 6801 mastery. have to go crit now
[1:47:57] NajkPlays: I was in a key so super late to the Legendary talk. But I also think they are dumb. Love playing blood dk, but stopped as soon as they added the legendary. Since I don't wanna to the raid every week, when I don't even enjoy raiding
[1:48:06] y0rge: idk ask shaman discords gods

[1:48:58] y0rge: so you say peopel from discord are wrong ?
[1:48:59] bbaesuzy: Weakaura is not exactly in the middle of the screen. My obsessive compulsive disorder level is rising.
[1:48:59] Zaden95: There's a haste breakpoint in Demo at like 27% purely if you stand in melee and use dreadstalkers so they don't have to travel to the boss its weird lmao
[1:49:02] nalight: wowhead guide says that elemental shaman should have 7.2k mastery but its only my alt so have not checked why.

[1:49:24] lemmegreen: because Murlock      .io
[1:49:25] liviu_81: PauseChamp
[1:49:27] maybehhhh: ele has mastery hardcap too, at 88% your primordial wave puts you exactly at 100% mastery
[1:49:27] Zilvaan: Elemental shaman actually has a mastery hard cap since you dont get a benefit above 100% (chance to duplicate your spells cant go above 100%) and when you reach 88% mastery you reach the 100% with yout 12% mastery buff from elemental blast.
[1:49:29] skyesarrow: boomie only wants 6801 mastery ;)
[1:49:29] gfvaris: highest rated enh shamy in m+ has 5800 mast 4k vers 4.2k haste 1k crit + using Crab
[1:49:37] FauniB: @nalight elemental has a hardcap because the mastery with ele blast goes over 100% and if the mastery is just copying spells, above 100% no gain
[1:49:44] OfMikeAndMen: its not "I need 6800 mastery", its "i need 7282 haste for optimal DPS, which I can only get if I go down to 6800 mastery", no?
[1:49:51] FauniB: like you cannot have 105% chance to overload a sspell
[1:50:13] DIXONdB: @OfMikeAndMen u can get 8k mast ez for optimal
[1:50:22] silentkillervgc: my enh shaman have 3k crit, 4.8k haste, 5750 mastery and 1500 vers
[1:50:37] silentkillervgc: 5800 is DR so you want to get other stats
[1:50:40] maybehhhh: 7200
[1:50:42] midchi: I feel like players confused when a stat hits diminishing returns that its some form of hard cap
[1:50:44] WeaselMuffin: you can get 100% chance to proc windfury during doom winds for enhance
[1:50:45] maybehhhh: easily
[1:50:46] WeaselMuffin: but thats irrelevant
[1:50:49] OfMikeAndMen: @OfMikeAndMen I'm just picking numbers. theres no hard cap for a stat, you just have to sacrifice some to get optimal values of others
[1:50:51] Zilvaan: like 7k
[1:50:53] WeaselMuffin: it doesnt mean you have a stat cap
[1:51:01] qda__: I feel like enhance players don’t understand what hardcap really means KEKW
[1:51:25] silentkillervgc: enh doesnt have hardcap but love all stats
[1:51:29] qda__: same
[1:51:31] Hemenia: ctrl f - 6800 - nothing
[1:51:32] Kolomito1: +
[1:51:56] Cocotao: Frost mage at 33.3% crit is a hard cap
[1:52:03] intembossfight: +34 ples
[1:52:19] silentkillervgc: if you hit DR on mastery as enh shaman, its probasbly better to get more other stats
[1:52:21] FauniB: eb bolstering NotLikeThis
[1:52:26] gfvaris: bolstering EB OH NO
[1:52:33] Land_ZGZ: Eww 29 bolstered fort stinger lol
[1:52:48] Zilvaan: Zilvaan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:52:52] silentkillervgc: i tanked +24 TOTT and sentinel hit me for 3.2m
[1:52:53] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[1:52:59] Hemenia: A rule to follow is that Mastery remains valuable enough to keep considering for both builds even after you breach the 5100 rating diminishing returns point.
[1:53:12] looya: only a few people have managed +28 eb on bolstering 😅
[1:53:12] MooniexVibes: oh Jesus, I literally did an 11EB on my alt and dude…. I swear it was harder than the higher keys on my main 💀
[1:53:20] Konzex187: @Naguura  hi can u show me ur trinkets :)
[1:53:31] hiimcusz: So just frost mage?
[1:53:34] jarilrpg: the real question is why do gnomes have 5 toes, but 4 fingers?

[1:53:57] maybehhhh: at 7200
[1:54:10] hiimcusz: Frost mage 33% would = 100% crit chance on shatter, rendering rest of crit chance almost useless
[1:54:53] MooniexVibes: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:54:59] maybehhhh: the only reason people brought up ele was becasue you were saying mastery doent have hardcaps
[1:55:02] intembossfight: blackrockfoundery was so fun tho
[1:55:09] lemmegreen: the best thing you can do is copy the best players stat proportion and scale it to you item level as broad rule of thumb
[1:55:16] Kuroz: I've a mental hard cap on numbers with no meaning I can read in chat hmmMeeting
[1:55:16] silentkillervgc: ele mastery have a hardcap
[1:55:21] qda__: she didn’t say mastery doesn’t have hardcaps

[2:34:49] MooniexVibes: for the first pull with a pres I always always always forget their range lol then once I realize it I am a good moonkin and don’t stand in Narnia
[2:35:21] TheGame402: is the outlaw completly dry or do they just do tank dps in big pulls?
[2:35:39] MBG_95: Pres evokers hate it too :D
[2:36:06] seutoxze: melee chicken is no fun
[2:36:07] Babyclaws: that 25yd range is what every evoker spec is asking to be changed KEKW
[2:36:08] LeeMoreTouchy: @TheGame402 both KEKW
[2:36:08] Miilloo_tv: as a pres evoker main its awful
[2:36:21] brewfest32: holy pally is short range to right?
[2:36:30] MooniexVibes: I also have a Pres, which I don’t play much, but I was just trying to do the dispel boss of fall on a weekly 18 and we bricked it after 3 wipes because the hunter and the shadow were standing on both ends of the room perfectly out of range of eachother. At that point idk what to tell them lol
[2:36:31] LeeMoreTouchy: @brewfest32 nop is 40 yards
[2:36:46] Atriohm: Just stand somewhere in Indonesia and not get healed like the hunters do, without a care in the world
[2:37:08] brewfest32: ahh
[2:37:28] lemmegreen: factz
[2:37:43] vikutoru11: aren't we supposed to spam starfall this fight? or I've been doing it wrong this whole time?
[2:37:51] MBG_95: amazing you guys lived that
[2:38:05] Sebleh: @MooniexVibes The fact that they're at max range on that boss is the tell they fucking suck. Imagine giving yourself the longest fucking circle to cross to another zone instead of being in melee and being able to dodge orbs and swap cones really quickly.
[2:38:10] Miilloo_tv: pres evoker pressing EC during cc

[2:38:39] MooniexVibes: @sebleh on my moonkin I am a melee in that fight lol I am right up in that bosses face lol makes it so much easier to dodge everything
[2:38:52] winessie: the only thing which i hate when i play pres that all the ranged stands behind me on this boss and can't use my breath on them, so i struggle at the end
[2:38:53] MooniexVibes: but yes they were ass and I don’t blame myself one bit for those wipes
[2:39:10] Sebleh: @mooniexvibes yeah it’s infinitely less movement in melee lol
[2:39:12] MooniexVibes: @winessie at that point you just have to echo and pray for then
[2:39:24] MooniexVibes: *them
[2:39:32] brewfest32: what key lvl is this?
[2:39:40] Kuroz: 28

[2:40:06] Sebleh: a pres evoker once yelled at me in SBG that I have to stand in front of him and I was like “how the fuck do I bait the circles away from the group if I’m next to the group?”
[2:40:08] Azorktv: oh nonon
[2:40:30] Atriohm: When I recue ranged, they just disengage back to where they were. I just let them die
[2:40:38] KraylenDW: Good Morning Chat! Did we ever buy those condoms?
[2:40:46] MooniexVibes: yeah its just a learning thing. honestly range usually get my reversions/echos and then melee just get breath heals lol
[2:41:24] MooniexVibes: and I’m ass at Pres so I can’t say anything

[3:09:21] thundork: "bear form" by taylor swift
[3:09:34] Kaelangg: @th3janitor how? KEKW
[3:09:34] lemmegreen: you really need to give T Swift a chance ...she is worth it
[3:09:58] th3janitor: its truth :D
[3:10:00] Sebleh: Damn so I can't call you trash? seblehTrash
[3:10:09] th3janitor: she was born.... jk
[3:10:20] rewnzor: Actually Taylor has a pretty unique sound compared to modern pop, she's only generic because people are trying (and failing) to copy her
[3:10:20] Kaelangg: @th3janitor opinion isnt truth, and yours is wrong
[3:10:33] UnDeadsch: Lol your healer is a German streamer
[3:10:37] lemmegreen: Low Fi T Swift is the play ... a true blessing
[3:10:59] Sebleh: @lemmegreen You caught my attention with this.
[3:11:04] crunchy93: she's very talented but about as simple as pop music can get. i liked her folk albums she did in the covid years
[3:11:10] Mizikuro: Can we get your plater profile somewhere?
[3:11:11] rewnzor: AI generated spotify poop is what I'd call trash
[3:11:25] Kaelangg: most people who hate taylor refer to all the songs that got famous 10 years ago and 'that shake it off song'
[3:11:37] Kuroz: !plater
[3:11:37] StreamElements: My plater profile is available for subs on my discord in the corresponding UI channel.
[3:11:38] rewnzor: Shake it off is a GOAT song
[3:11:41] th3janitor: @Kaelangg dont think an opinion can be wrong because you disagree with it
[3:11:57] tehaliii: don't really like her music either but she's clearly a very successful artist and business person
[3:12:14] applesauce399: Feels like people don't dislike Tswift or her music (even if its not for them). They dislike her fans. At least in my experience
[3:12:30] Nanoke007: your so good
[3:12:45] monochromessy: which boss is this??
[3:12:58] Megadisaster24: Taylor is really cute, I love her
[3:13:07] monochromessy: @Megadisaster24 ikr
[3:13:07] MasterNewt: You can't use up the word "trash" to describe Swift's songs because then you have TX2 make music and you already used up a good word to describe it.
[3:13:27] rewnzor: I think you're totally right, if Undertale fans didn't exist

[3:13:52] ConcernedGaming: Some people seem to think that people like t-swift has the power to stop her Weirdge fans being Weirdge
[3:14:03] AceReformed: Aight, time to do a little lifting YEP Gl with the keys caro, stay awesome chat naguuraSwole
[3:14:24] Mikko_p1: Hey hey, looking lovely today Caro, hope you have a good one

[3:14:38] Sebleh: Naguura are you excited about the Elden Ring DLC? It's gonna be great.
[3:14:39] prophetzoe22: how many gifted for a solo shuffle stream where we dont end until we get 2100
[3:14:40] Kaelangg: i think thats called maturity
[3:14:45] silentkillervgc: bolstered dragon hurt so bad
[3:14:56] th3janitor: no one mentioned hate, just her music is trash. its pop generic same ol people can like it all the want doesnt bother me i dont listen to it
[3:14:57] Megadisaster24: It's the popularity factor
[3:15:01] dnfbowser: hating is bad for human being
[3:15:02] KnotlessKnot: but hating is never the play
[3:15:15] JevyJ: The people who hate things passionately, in another world, would be the biggest swiftie fans LOL
[3:15:20] Kaelangg: especially when its someone famous who literally doesnt know you exist
[3:15:21] moowaukee: people that hate watch or hate listen to things confuse me
[3:15:36] applesauce399: It exists everywhere. I have retail friends that vehemently hate SOD fans/players bc of the fervor for the game. It's like anything. If people are loud about liking something it is bound to rub people the wrong way. Not eveyrone likes everyone. SeemsGood
[3:15:50] hexathos: good morning ^^
[3:15:56] th3janitor: look at how triggered her fan base get when you disagree with them or say something against there artist.. thats hate

[3:16:06] Kuroz: pepePHONE
[3:16:10] Ignite_CLO: i do hate the main rival sport teams of my team but its only in the context of the sport, like i dont really hate any player or fanbase or team but its just part of the sports fandom
[3:16:13] Mikko_p1: I look for peace in everything I do, if I come across something I don't like or disagree with, I just remove myself from that thing and try to be happy

[3:19:50] Sebleh: @th3janitor A common misconception is that moonkins use "astral" power. It's actually Ass-tral power, because you're supposed to feel like an ass playing moonkin, and you use that to do damage to yourself and others too.
[3:20:13] Thamradhel: cuz bolstering

[3:29:07] HatWings: Hi everyone. Anyone else keeps getting disconnected from WoW / can't log in?
[3:29:14] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD.
[3:29:24] KnotlessKnot: u are not playing mushrooms anymore?
[3:29:27] Nefaii: should have done the echo portal tech just saying
[3:29:51] toniban89: why is Asmon so negative on wow , game doesnt seem to be in such an awfull state
[3:29:56] th3janitor: @HatWings specific area? cause theres an old bug with the network setting for speed turn it off
[3:30:03] mumesmestari: how is ele shaman even at this level key? must be r1
[3:30:08] lemmegreen: i was dcing earlier while phased OCE on as NA player
[3:30:17] ConcernedGaming: @toniban89 He wouldn't know. He doesn't play it. He just knows that he doesnt like it
[3:30:17] applesauce399: maybe i didn't watch enough. But after seeing echos tech I just mentally checked out bc echo tech gap lol. That portal shit was nuts.
[3:30:27] toniban89: @ConcernedGaming lol
[3:30:33] HatWings: @th3janitor I'm not sure what you mean. I'm in the UK if that's what you mean by area?
[3:30:44] stv1c: Starfall doesnt work on this boss unless they fixed it. it doesnt hit the adds
[3:31:01] th3janitor: oh no sorry its a setting in game and certain areas will cause a dc if the setting is on
[3:31:14] th3janitor: its optimize network for speed
[3:31:25] th3janitor: im uk also an no dc's
[3:31:39] Gamerhcp: PepePHONE @kuroz
[3:31:49] Kuroz: pepePHONE @Gamerhcp
[3:31:56] ConcernedGaming: @ConcernedGaming More seriously. Asmon hates the WoW Token and hes going to be sour on the game as long as it exists (despite having his fans hand him everything on a platter) and he doesn't like the Dragonflight Aesthetic he thinks its too "Disney like" and wants it to be more Grimdark like WOTLK. Thats really all it comes down to
[3:32:09] HatWings: @th3janitor Oh, I just can't get in. Keep getting server disconnect. If I do get in, I get disconnected in Valdrakken as soon as I move out of inn
[3:32:10] stv1c: Starfall doesnt work on this boss unless they fixed it. it doesnt hit the adds @Naguura
[3:32:29] Gamerhcp: Hello Caro seblehDinkdonk
[3:32:30] th3janitor: @HatWings do you have an alt? tried loggin in with them?
[3:32:30] biggseeey: @ConcernedGaming i mean, the wow token is just bad for the game though
[3:32:47] madsu12345: can i find your grid 2 profile import anywhere?
[3:32:52] Kuroz: !ui
[3:32:52] StreamElements: My UI and all Weakauras are available  for subs  on my discord server in the subscriber-area. Make sure you connect your discord to your twitch account to access it -> https://discord.gg/naguura
[3:32:53] HatWings: @th3janitor I haven't tried that yet. Most of the time I can't get to character list
[3:33:01] xiaoteezyoce: banger
[3:33:02] ConcernedGaming: @ConcernedGaming I love the WoW Token. I'd probably stop playing if it didnt exist
[3:33:04] stv1c: Its so weird why they cant fix it
[3:33:14] madsu12345: ty
[3:33:17] th3janitor: @HatWings hmm only other suggestion is restart blizzard app/ pc and then try a repair
[3:33:18] StreamElements: Repair this wideASS
[3:33:29] ItsYent: @biggseygaming the WoW token doesn’t really affect the game for a lot of people imo
[3:33:36] HatWings: @th3janitor I'll give it a shot. Thank you :)

[3:33:50] applesauce399: @ConcernedGaming That's fair and all but the dude hasn't actually "played" the game in a decade at this point -- at least since legion. Not saying his opinion is invalid. But it's just tiring to hear what he's critiquing with such weight when he hasn't been playing or liked the game for a long while now.
[3:34:07] biggseeey: @ItsYent it effects the value of everything that can bought
[3:34:08] LightdarkGaming: why did they even bring back fort+bolst its so dumb
[3:34:12] Gamerhcp: Rest in peace
[3:34:14] ConcernedGaming: @ConcernedGaming Yeah because he basically just looked at the way DF looked and went "Nah"
[3:34:48] ConcernedGaming: @ItsYent Not really. Commodities are cheaper than they have ever been
[3:34:53] Gamerhcp: naguuraClap
[3:34:58] Gamerhcp: You survived
[3:35:10] ItsYent: @biggseygaming  yeah and you have to spend minimal money on a character tbh. for the past 3 expansions I’ve been surviving off less than 500k an entire expansion lol
[3:35:18] beldemort25: I think ur m+ timer is broken
[3:35:34] Gamerhcp: naguuraMonkaS
[3:35:36] LightdarkGaming: @ItsYent unless u wanna put together lege, which costed me of total 300k :D
[3:35:42] Gamerhcp: That's illegal as a moonkin
[3:35:54] looya: !song
[3:35:55] StreamElements: Current Song: David Guetta, Kim Petras - When We Were Young (The Logical Song)
[3:35:59] ItsYent: @lightdarkgaming  sadge I haven’t gotten it yet
[3:36:06] biggseeey: @ItsYent but i could also spend real money to get boosted in pvp or through raids for achievs. and because of wow token, its not agaisnt TOS
[3:36:49] ItsYent: @biggseygaming  true but people did that before the token . it’s just a toss up I know a lot of people who are only able to play wow cuz of the token supplying their sub
[3:36:50] mystifyfps: @ItsYent sounds like a solid deal
[3:38:06] lemmegreen: that entangle timing was troll

[3:38:50] biggseeey: absolute banger btw
[3:39:04] biggseeey: @ItsYent that aspect of is great..
[3:39:32] billiferd: I just noticed, is your UI off center.....? @Naguura
[3:39:42] applesauce399: @biggseygaming I disagree. People will just buy gold and it promotes botting. Look at SOD/classic in general. RMT is a problem in literally every MMO environement on the market. FF14, WoW, BDO, GW2, Runescape, etc. WoW and Runescape both just bit the bullet and created a "legit" way to do it. And i dont think it impacts other players negatively MOST of the time.
[3:39:43] ConcernedGaming: I have relatively little time to play this game, and I didn't build up a Cash pool of millions during WoD when it was given out for free. So without Tokens I'd be forced to use what limited gaming time I have to farm gold for enchants and stuff, rather than do what I want to do like Raiding and Keys and Arenas
[3:39:48] Gamerhcp: Good job
[3:39:50] imthabeast: were your wrath casts .6 seconds without a haste buff? wtf?

[5:41:20] Andersonmps: Imagine doing taxes. What a nightmare
[5:41:22] thegirltv: 8 raiders from thegirltv have joined! 
[5:41:23] azi_cs: sounds like American tax evasion.  😂.  send payment from unnamed account, no liability
[5:41:33] Sebleh: my twitch payouts read “twitch interactive payments”
[5:41:41] Sebleh: not just visa whatever
[5:41:51] Sebleh: yeah
[5:41:58] Itamaca: its the money from MDI caster?
[5:42:06] Sebleh: could just be different service they use in NA vs EU
[5:42:14] learningtogrowtogether: was is the lowest twitch streamer make.

[5:44:48] Stricken79: all I ever paid naguura in was shitty AUD KEKW
[5:44:49] Sebleh: I would imagine they get paid in the currency of their own country regardless of where they are.
[5:44:49] learningtogrowtogether: ok. if you just started twitch how much would you make as a new account. my son wants to try. so I’m just curious
[5:45:19] ppdxd: where do you know anjuna from btw?
[5:45:28] Sebleh: no you get paid in USD. twitch chat would never just claim something without a factual basis.
[5:45:39] hobo0112: my knee making that joint sound when I stand up
[5:45:46] Sebleh: @learningtogrowtogether your income depends on viewership. if you have no viewers you make no money.

[5:46:54] learningtogrowtogether: very interesting
[5:47:22] hobo0112: I would rather work at Mcdonald lol
[5:47:29] Stricken79: a whole 50 dollars, where's my webcam I'm signing up NODDERS
[5:47:35] faulen: Oh, then maybe Twitch sends the payment to the Visa account to convert to USD to Euro then it get put in your account? And it comes across in your account as the last company that touched it? Just speculation who knows
[5:47:55] belladonnix: with 2 viewers every ten years🫣
