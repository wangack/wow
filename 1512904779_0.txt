[0:48:51] eshonxv: yes that was it
[0:48:53] Tablescraps_: lol yeah take the elevator down
[0:48:54] manowar_gaming: In original tbc I was a main tank for a hardcore raiding guild, avoidance is the way 45-50% block 25% dodge 25% parry and as much block value as you can get. strong threat through shield slam and you don't get hit very often unless you pop shield block, which is a guaranteed block and you fill up on rage. With that you can spam shield slam revenge and heroic strike. Just make sure your good on hit and expertise and its so nice.
[0:48:54] barclain2021: @The_Sneaky_Goose you there? is that mount really worth it?
[0:48:58] SmizeGuy: im coming

[0:57:03] Joppekpist: Armor pen prot will probably have to wait until later season, but annoying full resi prot will probably be super good for BG's @Swifty
[0:57:19] fowlmoves: What is dkp?
[0:57:54] ekove14: do you ever see rico anymore?
[0:58:00] dano8989: auction off items
[0:58:01] BigJustin26: dragon kill points
[0:58:09] fowlmoves: why not call it gold then?
[0:58:12] eshonxv: true, it all started in wotlk
[0:58:17] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Midnight Escape (KENSHI remix) by Occams Laser -> https://prtzl.io/V1H3db7zKKWPwMH5
[0:58:23] bitlexx: @fowlmoves it is
[0:58:26] Nazgewl: dkp is dragon kill points
[0:58:27] lucky666dice: KEKW
[0:58:29] fowlmoves: @BigJustin26 will check that, thanks
[0:58:30] eshonxv: i remember seeing gdkp 15 year ago in wotlk lol funny how ppl think its some new phenomenon
[0:58:32] Nazgewl: was an old lootsystem back in the day
[0:58:34] barclain2021: 500k prolly
[0:58:34] Storvn: ez 100k+
[0:58:34] bitlexx: @fowlmoves GDKP
[0:58:37] Joppekpist: 150k
[0:58:39] lucky666dice: I guess it will cost you a kidney haha
[0:58:52] Scelsius: dbw wont be as expensive as sts hc
[0:59:06] fowlmoves: @bitlexx ahh, so G for gold. I assume there are other types of dragon points
[0:59:27] dano8989: GDKP is crazy in TBC. Seeing how much people spend on warglaives made me very happy I got mine for free
[0:59:34] BigJustin26: it was the goofy system that people made back in vanilla where you'd get points you could eventually spend on loot in raids. you'd accrue them from killing bosses with said raid group
[0:59:53] FONGHH: you even made a video about it when you first got it! =D
[0:59:58] BigJustin26: and it was "Dragon Kill Points" because it started being used on Onyxia
[1:00:18] fowlmoves: @BigJustin26 nice insights
[1:00:22] invinciblue: dbw will be ninja looted so often ppl will quit the game
[1:00:49] eshonxv: @invinciblue ppl dont actually ninja in classic, never seen a ninja in 3 years
[1:00:51] Joppekpist: you need sharpening stone for axe
[1:00:53] Joppekpist: not weightstone
[1:01:09] dano8989: Yeah, sharpening stone for off-hand. MH gets windfury

[1:01:18] ekove14: do you ever see rico or tenex anymore swifty?
[1:01:45] BigJustin26: Deathbringer's Will and... what was that trinket that dropped off Twin Valkyr in ToC?
[1:01:55] invinciblue: they might prioritise top damage dealers based on addon thats how it happened to me
[1:02:01] FONGHH: @BigJustin26 Death Verdict
[1:02:03] eggilin: not much ninjas anymore, just gdkp scammers
[1:02:09] Scelsius: death's choice
[1:02:19] Nazgewl: They are nerfing human racial
[1:02:20] VOLAAD: That warlock's damage!
[1:02:30] eshonxv: @invinciblue thats called loot council, it didn't get "ninjad"
[1:02:39] BigJustin26: ya Death's Verdict if you're alliance and Death's Choice if you're horde
[1:02:46] KidRecklessXD: do you have to be attuned to get into ssc?
[1:02:48] Nazgewl: @swifty human racial will only get rid of stuns now
[1:02:50] Nazgewl: they are changing it
[1:02:57] BigJustin26: it was a powerful trinket
[1:03:03] BronxBomber__: @KidRecklessXD not anymore
[1:03:21] Joppekpist: Chest and shoulders
[1:03:22] fowlmoves: The ring is pretty decent for rogues if i remember
[1:03:29] fowlmoves: nv
[1:03:30] fowlmoves: nvm
[1:03:32] Inflex873: will you play dragonflight?
[1:03:38] Scelsius: trinket from halios is insane too on arms
[1:03:39] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:03:43] Nazgewl: i think that trinket is pretty good for druids / paladins
[1:03:46] Nazgewl: for defensive gear
[1:03:47] BigJustin26: ya the human passive in wrath was amazing lol
[1:03:49] StreamElements: jms5c8 just cheered 500 bits PogChamp
[1:03:51] Abtei: leather shoulders with exp
[1:03:56] dano8989: They are going to be dragging this boss across the room, threat drops everytime they drag it, don't pull aggro
[1:03:57] t1ckt8ck: For wrath protleveling get the badge block trinket !
[1:04:28] Baghead94: I think it will fall faster than TBC thats for sure
[1:04:38] fowlmoves: 100% wrath will fall faster
[1:04:41] lucky666dice: it will not. it will be a lifestyle for some people, just like TBC and Classic
[1:04:41] Maartinjshhh: top the charts
[1:04:41] Joppekpist: I don't think so, there's so many people who love wrath, way more than TBC
[1:04:45] Scelsius: no way it will fall off, achiv will be added people will have tons of things to do
[1:04:51] Abtei: depends hopw they manage server imbalance and dying server
[1:04:52] Plebking1: its gonna fall so fast
[1:04:53] bitlexx: Its the "What the Heck Trinket". Freezes the enemies brain while having them reading the stats.
[1:05:00] fowlmoves: Totally depends on dragon isles and how it can stick the old schoolers
[1:05:01] Plebking1: everything

[1:05:07] barclain2021: @Baghead94 I don't think so. So many players hold WOTLK as the best expansion so a lot more players may be returning.
[1:05:08] csr_27: FallWinning
[1:05:13] Concentration: they released SoM within 6 months of TBC release. Which was just absurd.
[1:05:20] Scelsius: ye wow is goona burnout a lot of people soon
[1:05:30] Joppekpist: at that point you can log in on wotlk and just raid and do arena whenever
[1:05:48] TheRealDeo_: it'll lose steam o ce people get their fix. they know what to expect, really.
[1:06:00] lucky666dice: year

[1:07:07] Joppekpist: Wrath has way more content than TBC, because arenas and pvp is actually good

[1:07:48] irelevant25: if someone is drunk, everything is good :D
[1:07:52] Joppekpist: TBC is like 5 different comps in arena, but wrath you can play all specs viably
[1:08:05] barclain2021: @Swifty it's cool get some loot homie we're here for you :)
[1:08:27] BigJustin26: was not a fan of gear score gatekeepers.

[1:24:30] Mudfist89: its the CPU that determines the frequency of the ram. Fx Intel runs lower than Ryzen

[1:27:01] Abtei: every PC part is a snowflake in this regard. some can handle the max, some need more fine tuning, and then there are the duds, that barely run minimum specc at all.
[1:28:36] awfulbadgames: Swifty What was your first PC?
[1:28:57] Abtei: better feeling. after building and pressing button nothing happens... and after 2 minutes you find out, u have forgotten to turn on the switch at the back :>
