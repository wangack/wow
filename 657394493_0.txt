[7:41:02] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: lool
[7:41:06] Kaizensu: Kappa
[7:41:06] Cheapshoty0uth: Stinks that mmos are the most expensive to make and least likely to succeed. I miss having all the "wow killers" coming out and having fun for a month before returning to WoW
[7:41:19] Burzumxwow: @Warcraft We watched AWC on youtube with 480p quality where ziqo commeted with muted mic. But this does this content deserve to be here?
[7:41:19] CrunkyBrewster: for me i can appreciate classic wow. i did enjoy playing it. but the sweet spot for me would be TBC or Wrath honestly
[7:41:21] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: "its only a warrior" not ppc
[7:41:23] muhuh: @Kaizensu so they would be suing themselves ? lmao
[7:41:29] chocolatemilkbandit: @cricashell its funny because you complainabout that but literally they had it earlier, adn people also complained, about class colors, it keep changing because people get buthurt regardless
[7:41:31] wavyREC: @Kaizensu i agree they need the class color nameplates
[7:41:32] lilchachi14: @cricashell it’s not that hard to tell which is which relax bud

[7:41:39] hellkatt__: activate class colors.on nameplate plz!!! spam this
[7:41:51] Burzumxwow: NotLikeThis
[7:41:56] Cheapshoty0uth: @RentANerd for nostalgia its vanilla for me. For actual gameplay Wrath was the pinnacle imo
[7:41:57] 9ntice: and how would they seperate the teams? @cricashell
[7:42:05] foxisnotgod: vujke with the bosnian internet got owned
