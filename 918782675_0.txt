[1:45:45] Coriollis: have to regrind everything hope the plaguefall trinket drops i /s
[1:46:09] yunggluten: They have to tune down the amount of valor needed to upgrade some of the higher items. 1000 valor for 3 item level is awful and will cause super bad burn out
[1:46:11] thebakeriscomingforu: Don't see a point grinding M+ right now
[1:46:20] NILLme: funny how 226 is there
[1:46:31] Zammityy: If this doesn't change, it's a Dead on arrival system.

[1:48:38] indiana__cones: Blizzard just wants people to raid or gtfo, m+ in SL is what PvP was in BFA, forgettable disposable content
[1:48:42] Gooseberries: They should treat valor like honor IMO

[1:52:43] MrGattz: @Holysal yeah but they dont need to be... they just need to stop trying to reinvent the game every time there is a problem
[1:53:16] Sollice: Hard to balance the players wanting loot and the corporate overlords saying string them along to keep their subs going

[1:54:13] birdstuff_: What is that addon O_O
[1:54:14] Amarlian: so 9.1 release date predictions April-May right? @Towelliee
[1:54:17] MrGattz: problem : we dont have enough loot. blizzard solution : lets add a super complex token system and call it valor but its not the same valor system from back in the day, you have jump through 18 hoops and spin around 7 times over the course of 2 weeks to upgrade 1 piece of gear. like come on.
[1:54:30] Coriollis: Jebaited

[1:55:05] Daismoon: Daismoon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:55:15] Sollice: @MrGattz Yep thats exactly whats happeneing. I dont understand why its so complicated. Cant they just up the loot a bit across the board and intitute the residium system
[1:55:24] CrunkyBrewster: thats blizzard man. you keep asking for something, and they give you something like it... but not really
[1:55:25] MuttonChopins: wildstar Sadge
[1:55:27] Roffasauras: if they're going to cap valour at 750 a week, they need to reduce the amount it requires to upgrade, right now it'll take like a month just to maximize a 2h to 220 if you get it at the lowest ilvl
[1:55:38] Keyastaron_: @towelliee you need items from 9.0.5 to use it?

[1:55:47] Moridin_Richard: Wildstar pog
[1:55:53] Sollice: Residum was fine. Scrap gear for points. Fewer points were a lottery on a item. Save more points and you can target a specific piece of gear
[1:55:57] lithium364: kinda crazy, we got mechagon a year ago, and we have to play int he maw, talk about different teams
[1:55:57] Sollice: That seemed to work fine

[1:56:38] centralqt: who fucking cares about some shitty m+ system when raiders are still dicked
[1:56:44] idenkaz_: know we need someone to say it out loud so they hear it.
[1:56:52] Wildside1177: The valor system is awful.
[1:56:54] Keyastaron_: they should let us farm conquest and just have us only upgrade the items a certain amount of times

[1:56:54] Coriollis: ok guess I`ll wait for 9.1 than
[1:56:57] MuttonChopins: By the time you fully upgrade gear, 9.1 is gonna come out
[1:56:57] Rottencoarse: oh @Towelliee it was the guy who had the callous hide
[1:56:58] bi9pants: It's the right idea but should be like badge of justice, you just buy gear with it
[1:56:59] Masqerader: If you can't get loot, it helps no one. It's complete shit. All they had to do was revert the loot changes, but noooooooo they always come out with some convoluted useless piece of shit system that helps no one lol
[1:57:01] MrGattz: @Sollice you know what i think the problem is? blizzard thinks if they add the same system from back in the day of if they add the same system from bfa that the community will call the lazy and yell at them for it. because lets be real here, the community has done that before. i think blizzard is stuck between a rock and a hard place because no matter what they do its wrong so they are just trying to pull anything out of their ass thats new so they dont get flamed
[1:57:02] centralqt: most raiders dont like doing m+

[1:58:05] Sollice: I guess @MrGattz . Valor is not the answer though. I think most people enjoy getting NEW gear. I mean upgrading your current gear is fine and all. But does it still feel good to have the same lets say boots for months? EVen if it is is ilevel appropriate
[1:58:06] nickolas52: ?

[2:01:00] RocketMan23: it would have to be 900% to be relavent
[2:01:00] niebvelungen: what
[2:01:03] Cyberangel89: Immolation Aura. Reminds of WC3 xD
[2:01:08] Masqerader: they still trying to push fel rush into rotation, no one wants that shit
[2:01:08] mizuryo: 5 KEKW
[2:01:13] firefly_on: havoc developer should retire already
[2:01:17] Keyastaron_: @towelliee this was 600% in the prepatch
[2:01:19] yunggluten: That has to be 10% not 100%. That has to be a typo
[2:01:34] Dagomarus: That 5% to 100% looks wrong lol
[2:01:48] yunggluten: 100% is insane
[2:02:02] Crowzcut: paladin tank changes does not look good with the wording
[2:02:07] indiana__cones: They need to STOP buffing havoc's over all dmg %, they have THE BEST aoe burst in the game, and trying to fix their single target that way is going to scuff the class so bad
[2:02:12] MrGattz: none?
[2:02:18] Coriollis: yeah was broken
[2:02:19] dreioo: ok :)

[2:03:03] Sollice: @indianacones2111 What specifically would you do to buff havoc ST?
[2:03:13] niebvelungen: Havoc is an expansion Feature not a spec
[2:03:17] NILLme: prob new devs
[2:03:31] MrGattz: @indianacones2111 yeah idk what they are doing. they have the numbers and stats. idk why they are just like blanket buffing and over tuning one skill over another.
[2:03:32] Sollice: I mined DH past two expansions and I switched off. I genuinely would like to go back to it
[2:03:36] bi9pants: it isn't bad at all
[2:03:39] CrunkyBrewster: its dead for me now FeelsBadMan
[2:03:52] Masqerader: they listened to players who complained it was OP, and nerfed it without considering it was heavily reliant on borrowed power in BFA
[2:03:54] CrunkyBrewster: I played Havoc is both Legion and BFA.. not now though
[2:03:54] Sollice: mained DH*
[2:03:59] Coriollis: maybe they think Havoc was too strong for Legion and BfA so they give it the warlock treatment ?
[2:04:01] ArcaneSyntax: maybe blizz was just tired of everyone bitching about DH.
[2:04:01] bi9pants: maybe top tier mythic its not but for the majority it performs well
[2:04:05] MuttonChopins: Havoc the new Enchanc?
[2:04:08] JokaThS: the legos for havoc are so bad and some of the changes they did also are bad
[2:04:13] indiana__cones: They need to rework the class tbh. we are past the whole idea of DH's being a stepping stone for new players, the gimmick is 2 expansions old
[2:04:16] CrunkyBrewster: yeah they put Havoc in time out basically
[2:04:32] casualboomer: @Towelliee I've been without power for days. Has there been anything mentioned about Soul Ash catch up in 9.0.5?
[2:04:33] Ordicos: the spec was easy to use and did top of the meters with little effort i found so they trying to make it more complex
[2:04:36] Sollice: Everyone was heavily buffed from borrowed power from BfA. Thats why we said at the end of the expansion some people were going to be in for a surprise with their class
[2:04:45] MOLAR305: I didn't even use it when it was my first char leveling through shadowlands
[2:05:02] ArcaneSyntax: @tacovendor93 whats funny is that a bunch of enhance mains switched to havoc the last two expacs.
[2:05:07] Sollice: Corruption also completely fucked the devs because they had no idea what classes were actually doing and made it difficult to tune in Shadowlands

[2:05:57] MuttonChopins: its tomorrow in the evening @FengornTwitch
[2:06:00] Roffasauras: I'm waiting for the inevitable boomkin guttage
[2:06:00] CrunkyBrewster: it doesnt matter. im not moving from Marks now
[2:06:03] MrGattz: k
[2:06:11] MrGattz: does that fix anything?
[2:06:13] yunggluten: None of the hunter "buffs" are worth it outside of Surging Shots for PvP. The other ones are all pretty bad
[2:06:19] indiana__cones: Corruption was just a mastery circle jerk. It just enhanced the passive strengths of most classes (think ignite, wounds etc)
[2:06:21] CrunkyBrewster: Nope LUL
[2:06:24] Rexialiton: I do LUL
[2:06:34] MrGattz: i used to LOVE playing bm. i could only hope they fix it
[2:06:38] thebakeriscomingforu: main issue is that every xpac since cata blizz has decided to redesign classes and specs. Some xpacs they do great, others they fall on their face
[2:06:39] raldrik: Do we think the nerf to both repeat decree and damage of Elysian Decree that Veng wont be king anymore?
[2:06:42] Crowzcut: i play bm
[2:06:44] yunggluten: Eagletalon's True Focus is a dps loss compared to running no legendary LULW
[2:06:53] FrankTizzle: BibleThump Stop shitting on Arcane Mages
[2:06:55] CrunkyBrewster: I feel like BM is where it was in Wrath right now.
[2:07:03] FrankTizzle: It's so hard to get into a group as Arcane FeelsBadMan
[2:07:04] LordKain73: I still.play bm. f mm!

[2:15:21] niebvelungen: Which is nice
[2:15:47] Bounty4321: Doom Winds is probably one of the best designed legendaries in the game because it synergizes with talents / a specific build.
[2:15:48] indiana__cones: They need to make legendary powers interchangeable is some shape or form, so I can swap specs without having to farm a whole new legendary

[2:17:11] ftwbot203: @towelliee the holy changes are pretty big, instead of 8 sec of 10% healing increase. Hymn now increases healing done by about 12% during hymn and 20% for 15 secs after. It makes Hymn a bit more valuable.
[2:17:41] Aervyper: @Towelliee i think at this point of the game i'm kinda done with wow. It's just going to be a long time before they fix anything

[2:19:59] zorthan76: echo leggo got nerfed
[2:20:05] Zammityy: about the same
[2:20:07] zorthan76: echo was only for keys

[2:33:01] HaloS23: @SwapT1_ oh they did???? missed it. interesting
[2:33:01] CrunkyBrewster: i think because they're hung up on how they wrote Anduin since Cata

[2:33:32] Wildside1177: THe rogue changes look amazing.
[2:33:44] thebakeriscomingforu: cause the story beat has been done to "death". So we'd rather see something else than Anduin becoming a lich king

[2:36:08] Bounty4321: @Towelliee Yeah but why do they need HIM specifically? I must've missed something because I don't understand why.
[2:36:19] Kyrrua: plot armor will protect Anduin, so nothing to be hyped about until it really happens imo
[2:36:24] idenkaz_: they mentioned it by turning him into a weapon. but thats it

[3:28:00] Pudgypantss: means you can transfer ur guy
[3:28:03] CrunkyBrewster: hmmm they're doing it seperate
[3:28:04] Clay2K_: Join or Die
[3:28:05] mavericks312: toon transfer
[3:28:11] Epicsapphire1988: perma classic
[3:28:16] mrpresbaby: 8 boss mega dungeon
[3:28:16] Divine2987: You can stay classic only if u want
[3:28:17] Coriollis: I dislike for eco reasons but seems ok
[3:28:17] MammothGB: bet its a realm transfer
[3:28:17] MILESkg21: so stay or transfer
[3:28:18] raldrik: Copy character but instead of copying to BC it is copying to classic
[3:28:18] Demanisraar: yeah you can transfer to bc or stay in classic
[3:28:19] micro_k816: but they need cap GOLD
[3:28:21] Arcueidd: Seems like you can transfer to avoid going to TBC
[3:28:23] belfastcl: fresh classic?
[3:28:23] Warcried: I would completely ban that employee for life from any blizzard game. : D rip
[3:28:24] Vajazle: can you do both?
[3:28:25] Holysal: move to classic or stay the course to TBC
[3:28:28] Tengtalks: They are splitting the servers. So either you transfer to tbc or keep your character in classic
[3:28:29] snarkydonald: Jigsaw - choose or die.
[3:28:30] D3mitr1: tbc is where it's at
[3:28:33] mavericks312: stay or go
[3:28:37] Demanisraar: yes stay or go it seems
[3:28:38] Blistz1: it means classic server will be transferred to BC but they will make a new Classic server for Classic only
[3:28:39] MammothGB: I'm guesing you have to choose classic or TBC for 1 character
[3:28:45] MammothGB: not both
[3:28:46] Antdavs24: wonder if you have to be 60 or not
[3:28:48] Athaeln: No you stay or transfer
[3:28:49] iamSotosan: Bet they keep servers for just classic and new servers that expand to BC
[3:28:51] D3mitr1: if WtLK classic comes out it's a wrap!
[3:28:54] Holysal: yes
[3:28:57] Blistz1: yeah

[3:29:13] Demanisraar: two clients I guess
[3:29:13] MatMatsuda: duplicate your toon and play a CLASSIC CLASSIC
[3:29:14] luckfore: Converting? thats dumb
[3:29:14] Pudgypantss: yes, current servers are going to tbc but they are going to have classic only servers you can transfer to
[3:29:16] RocketMan23: current servers are going to BC
[3:29:17] Phalamore: assume current serves progress, OR you can choose to transfer your toons to new Classic servers
[3:29:20] Sollice: Sounds like the current servers go to TBC and if you want to stay on classic they are making new classic servers and you can copy your characters to those new servers
[3:29:22] belfastcl: maybe they are merging old classic servers
[3:29:23] brewbrewbear: server is progressing you can transfer into a classic only realm
[3:29:24] MammothGB: You realm transfer
[3:29:24] RocketMan23: and if you want to stay on classic you go to a new server
[3:29:26] NILLme: Classic Era servers

[3:49:50] Bosweny: i think you have to start over
[3:49:50] brewbrewbear: Transfer not copy
[3:49:51] Uutef: its basically a server transfer to new classic realms
[3:49:52] Rosinenrosi: looks fucking a...... boring
[3:49:52] Collected1: the guild would have to split

[3:50:28] infektyd: i mean.. they could release more content in classic.. did say new classic era
[3:50:30] nheonkitty: I think the default is to move on and your copy to a new form of classic server
[3:50:36] Gravity16: @kingslayeryotam that’s what I think too
[3:50:36] Grumperdoo: sounds like if you chose to move on to bc content you just stay put but if you want to stay in classic you get assigned to another server - at least it seems like that
[3:50:36] SonofHorus82: I think it's going to start classic all over again. The existing servers will transfer to TBC and new servers will be created specifically for classic at phase 1.
[3:50:37] luckfore: There will be realms that are Classic and realms that are TBC
[3:50:41] brewbrewbear: Your server is going to BC. If you want to stay Vanilla you have to transfer that toon to a Vanilla only server

[3:50:46] MuttonChopins: they might make you choose to pick BC or Classic and if you choose Classic you get transfer into that server
[3:50:51] Daemoos6: If you want to stay in Classic, you have to transfer to a new server

[4:09:08] Crowzcut: but this wow
[4:09:09] Galloglas_Kilt: HOpefully they make it easier to unlock then
[4:09:10] Mogwaimonk: 9.1 covenant spec, 9.1.5 all the others?
[4:09:11] sussyrev: pretty sure this is worded so people dont think we can fly in the Maw
[4:09:13] Todmeister9000: I think it means we can fly in the areas but not in the In-Between
[4:09:13] Zonoxx_tv: it just means that there will be no flying in the maw
[4:09:13] happyspot: maybe in the four covenant zones but still no flying in the maw or new zone?
[4:09:15] jarilrpg: i think they just mean in the main SL zones, not counting the maw
[4:09:21] BravocadoBrad: FF sucks ass tho lol
[4:09:21] CADZtv: who cares about final
[4:09:25] MistaHat: The Flying @Towelliee lol this shit is real
[4:09:26] cevyr1: I just kinda took that as, we are not unlocking flying in the Maw
[4:09:28] SphinxyOCE: if you think this is fake then you're stupid
[4:09:30] noteworthynerd: Kappa Fake news
[4:09:32] Demanisraar: me :) Kappa
[4:09:33] Pannekaker: @Towelliee I'm pretty sure it just means that you can't fly in the Maw or the new zone
[4:09:33] Kinghorn: 0%
[4:09:34] luckyunderachiever: KKona fake news
[4:09:34] foxdie889: it is i think
[4:09:36] Korupcija_: could be fake
[4:09:36] KaisenSiru: Me :)
[4:09:39] TheFuriyon: It's hella official, it's worded 100% blizzlike

[4:09:42] Claritycraft: KKona FAKE NEWS
[4:09:43] BravocadoBrad: 98% official lol
[4:09:43] luckfore: yes they released on purpose to distract from the amazing 9.1 they have in store for us
[4:09:44] roxtempo: 100% fake

[4:09:53] mavericks312: flying this early would be great though
[4:09:55] Zonoxx_tv: it just means that there will be no flying in the maw
[4:10:06] azzurrin: Maybe cross faction grouping
[4:10:08] azzurrin: :D
[4:10:08] adrian_fell: @Towelliee all the zones in the same realm so u can fly around them all without having to use flying paths?
[4:10:09] Broomba: bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir
[4:10:10] Naithos_: There's no way they would make us unlock flying per covenant. It probably just means that flying will be available in the 4 initial zones, not the Maw
[4:10:11] Demanisraar: NEw covenant campaign then
[4:10:14] xluckydawgx: Maybe no more cov only?
[4:10:15] Eekim189: I think it's saying that flying will only be available in the 4 regions
[4:10:16] MOLAR305: unite the 4 covernants = RIPCORD

[4:10:45] xXSiebzehnXx: cocaine is a helluva drug
[4:10:47] Amarlian: ah so my new guess is you get flying after you unite the four covenants and whatever level of renown they decide
[4:10:51] Templexx: @Towelliee whats the ideal release date you think?
[4:10:51] Rentis5: sylvanas is going to sacrifice herself to free anduin in the end 100%

[4:11:04] MrKray2: I think flying will be unlocked for you cov area, then once completed the unite cov thing you can fly in all areas

[4:16:49] adrian_fell: my guess is something is happening with the zones so u can fly between them
[4:16:49] Galloglas_Kilt: Probably just the zones
[4:16:49] Aedarax: each zone porb
[4:16:50] MOLAR305: bigtime conspiracy theory: maybe this is why the deep dive is only 30 mins, so they dont have to cover everything
[4:16:51] Templexx: my bet is each zone only
[4:16:53] Ser_Theobald: I think portals still
[4:16:53] thebakeriscomingforu: each zone. won't be flying between

[4:19:08] Coriollis: fresh Classic makes sense since eco was ruined by bots
[4:19:10] anorfidus: @Towelliee you can change the wowhead theme in the top
[4:19:17] VictorAvalanche: Can you even play TBC as lvl 1?
[4:19:21] magemaster225: current servers get rolled into BC and they have new classic servers you can transfer
[4:19:29] Bayless_TV: @Towelliee Is it okay to openly discuss the leaks in chat or would you rather us not?
[4:19:31] Godan14: They have to do something with player gold going into TBC @Towelliee

[4:19:44] kipduran: would like to play BC classic but don't think I can handle leveling from lvl 1
[4:19:47] Cardale_: I believe if you want to stay classic than you have to xfer @Towelliee
[4:19:49] clubnp: 'NEW' classic servers
[4:19:51] mlevenson88: Progress or reroll?
[4:19:52] MammothGB: I think they're moving all servers to TBC and creating new servers to host classic specifically
[4:19:52] Templexx: let me start at lvl 58 plez
[4:19:54] BanteringGnomes: means your server is going to TBC
[4:19:55] Ezekyler: servers reset?

[4:19:58] Shrenko: seperate fresh servers @Towelliee and servers that is still with classic vanilla
[4:19:58] Capy_IRL: free transfers to "classic" servers prob
[4:19:59] fewyn: so current servers become TBC and new servers for CLASSIC
[4:20:01] JMoney_1331: i don't think they are leaks anymore, instead just full content information
[4:20:04] tecknoedestrukto: All existing classic will become TBC
[4:20:05] ninedraft317: what about horde palli in tbc? how will that work

[4:20:10] rhsiuol: yes
[4:20:10] SonofHorus82: when we got the survey, it implied that they were going to completely restart classic at phase 1 on new servers while moving the existing servers to TBC.
[4:20:12] PhillyDilly18: They gotta merge some servers
[4:20:12] letrickyxd: yes, cause everyone will want to go to TBC
[4:20:13] zal_63: classic is dead :(
[4:20:15] flebbooo: maybe they merging some old classic servers to make up for the drop off players going to tbc
[4:20:15] BanteringGnomes: if you want to move you go, if not you will be copied to a classic only server

[4:20:23] Wulfgrym: yes
[4:20:24] Ezekyler: TBC killed Classic, like WotlK killed TBC
[4:20:26] Haximaxi: all those ppl playing classic can gather on like 2-3 servers @Towelliee
[4:20:27] lukee_ar: yeep is dead.
[4:20:28] MammothGB: Yes but the classic servers will be more player dense because fewer choices available
[4:20:28] Vorog1: Can you do both?

[4:31:35] idenkaz_: could you imagine what would happen if they go against each other full powered like that? holy shit
[4:31:40] camekian: Tyrande will show us Elune to Kamehameha Jailer. We will kill the jailer the same way we killed an old god.
[4:31:45] Jonluke92: @towelliee night fae campaign does have the storyline where they say the only way to save a night warrior is to split the parts amongst multiple people
[4:31:51] SphinxyOCE: yep LUL
[4:31:51] Sarran_: true
[4:31:55] TheCliffyShow: Tyrande on Sylvanas action. Sounds like the sexiest boss fight ever.
[4:32:00] sarabara191: what if you can mount up inside though?
[4:32:04] dwolters_the_zombieman: lol
[4:32:05] PToastman: Yep

[4:32:58] mogsus: mogsus subscribed at Tier 2. 
[4:33:05] garlicco: the dungeon looks awesome
[4:33:06] SonofHorus82: Ok, here's how it's gonna go. Arth'duin will be the boss right before Sylvanus, but they'll be in the same room. After we beat down Arth'duin, there will be some non-cutscene RP to give us time to heal/re-buff. Fight with Sylvanas starts and we beat her down. Before we can kill her, Anduin comes back to the light and makes us NOT kill because he feels the good in her like he's fucking Luke Skywalker or something. Tyrande tells Anduin to get bent and pulls a Thrall and kill-steals Sylvanas.
[4:33:11] Vaeyra_Max: So, is all this 9.0.5 or 9.1 later in the year?

[4:35:15] KingofMeccano: ooo 15th June would be a dream come true with my b-day :D
[4:35:17] Whiskey_Corin: Longest end of expansion raid followed by longest start of expansion raid. It's all so tiresome... I want to get off this ride
[4:35:23] qwerth: also it's harder to put together a game when developers are working from home so I think 6 months is probably as soon as we see it

[4:37:35] Stonkeep: if it leaks once it is real, if every year same thing happens its not a leak its a PR
[4:37:38] Pannekaker: It's way too much to be a hype play

[5:17:14] Czyszn: when is 9.1 droppign?
[5:17:14] Khalio23: Legion in general blows SL out of the water imo
[5:17:20] amar_ofc: Do you think it will come out 4th may? :) @Towelliee Heard some people say it, cause it matches wil the release date in vanilla to tbc
[5:17:24] hulklock: +1 to that. these dungeons rock. dont mind running multiple times. only one i dislike is spires and the damn travel time

[5:17:37] casualboomer: @Khalio23 early Legion was AWFUL for alts. Literally RNG leggo decided what class you played
[5:17:40] poorhooligans: if they got their systems right SL would be dope
[5:17:48] itjustfeelsright: ya if 9.0.5 is coming in march
[5:17:50] SnakeDoc919: @Khalio23 Other than the legendary system, I have to agree. Hate doing Torghast for the legendaries but being able to target them is nice.
[5:17:51] kirshoxd: hard to compare SL to legion since we still in first patch
[5:18:03] Khalio23: @casualboomer yeah if you were a metaslave
[5:18:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: they are way behind
[5:18:13] luckyfooo: first patch of legion wasnt all that great, end of it was awesome tho
[5:18:18] Metket: @Towelliee tell me something you don't know LUL
[5:18:18] letrickyxd: Prideful is fun, but lots of the dungeons are just linear hallways with no flexibility
[5:18:23] Doomedsaint: Maybe this is all to build hype for tomorrow where they show everything with cinematics.
[5:18:23] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[5:18:25] Davalin: lol

[5:18:27] casualboomer: @Khalio23 you mean if you raided or ran M+?
[5:18:27] Sarbanes93: I dont think the game can wait until June for new content tbh
[5:18:30] SilkeySmooth: good thing classic tbc will be may 4th
[5:18:30] letrickyxd: SL dungeons feel like FF dungeons lmao
[5:18:51] Czyszn: any diablo leaks?
[5:18:52] blizuzi: SL dungeons > legion > BFA
[5:18:53] PToastman: Torghast levels are not nearly as random as I was lead the believe in beta
[5:19:00] mavericks312: we shoud all apply for the PR job thought
[5:19:09] wesosdqueso: months of work to the trash LUL
[5:19:11] duolmaercs: @Towelliee New Mortal Kombat trailer just dropped
[5:19:22] Sepron14: Bit late duolmaercs
[5:19:23] ikzilion_xiv: unless they are creating hype so more people watch the blizzcon
[5:19:33] amar_ofc: What date you think TBC will come out? people are saying 4th may, cause it matches the old release time in vanilla to tbc.
[5:19:33] Khalio23: @casualboomer Dude, i said "imo" doesnt mean what i say is the defenitive truth. I enjoyed the hell out of legion compared to this soulless gabage that SL is
[5:19:33] Scojan: I'm sure they wanted it to come out during their blizzcon
[5:19:35] maulinx: i mean im still gonna watch lol
[5:19:35] wreckedgum: blizz have press release on the leaks?
[5:19:58] Moondrius: @letrickyxd FF dungeons are sweet!

[5:20:06] Sollice: LESS people will watch now not moren
[5:20:07] Drizz_36: blizzard definitely did not want to leak the entire presentation for WoW lol
[5:20:15] letrickyxd: @Moondrius no they're not lmao, FF dungeons are horrible
[5:20:24] MrGattz: whoever did it will never be heard from again
[5:20:36] MILESkg21: they will be taken out back PepeHands
[5:20:37] Doomedsaint: Could have been a scheduling issues with an automated system where those things are scheduled to be released at a specific time and the person set the time wrong.
[5:20:42] gerallliilillililililllid: slyvannas in a bikini
[5:20:45] BlindsydeGaming: the best two leaks, Covenant cosmetics usable on any class, and flying
[5:20:50] MrGattz: blizzard will chain them up in a basement in the bottom of some random ass apartment building
[5:20:54] Sollice: @towelliee Bellular made it sound like he has had the leaks for a bit he just didn't publish them
[5:20:55] NILLme: bet it was a scheduled post and someone screwed up the date/time

[5:23:58] cynical_effect12: Looks like the Titans will own the division for the next few years.. lol

[5:24:30] CoreMan510: philly fan here. Get ready for bad picks, unnecessary sacks from holding onto the ball too long, and inaccurate passes. I wish him the best though.
[5:24:32] theoriginalzinng: until he gets injured... again
[5:24:32] rillo5: He will definitely need a reboot. Might be good again and might not, but definitely the best option the colts had to go after for that price
[5:24:41] cbiskit89: PFF grades on the o-line weren't last in the league they were middle of the pack despite all the injuries
[5:24:44] Antdavs24: he's got the best o line and a great receiving core now lol
[5:24:45] rantre208: As a Cowboys fan, I am happy with the trade

[5:25:15] Aphro_Samurai: good pickup with Wentz
[5:25:15] drunken_werewolf_hunter: @towelliee yeah, but the colts line was notorious for being bad. I don't know if they will keep their good O line
[5:25:17] Ojomon_: Yeah but a fan of the team he’s playing on would put that blame on the line and not the qb he’s getting
[5:25:20] stratiss: Blinded by Talk Radio

[5:50:12] Wheeellz: Why do those casual players need 220 loot
[5:50:12] Bigirishred: hell I can't even get invited to keys because I am a warrior.

[5:50:21] GnomeLickerGames: im sitting at a 200ilvl and find it hard to get into groups for anything over a +5
[5:50:34] LordOfDread: Raider io killed mythic plus for casuals
[5:50:34] antori_92: @Towelliee do we know what next raid is?
[5:50:40] idenkaz_: KSM= every dungeon 15+ timed.
[5:50:41] Syghtless: im 223 equiped and i dont have KSM yet, and it iwll give me nothing in 9.0.5 @Towelliee
[5:50:46] SilkeySmooth: the casuals were out ones they hit ilvl 200 shadowlands is not casual friendly
[5:50:50] keeindordel: @antori1992 yes its Maw raid
[5:50:53] Kasaiya13: Terry was complaining about the valor system the other day
[5:51:05] keeindordel: we're storming the maw and yes, SYLVANS is 1 of the bosses
[5:51:07] Aro725: im just going to stick to pvp gear lol. Way eaiser, maybe ill go for a trinket or something but thats it
[5:51:10] Mecabeast: this system would of been fine if we had it at launch I think
[5:51:14] Metket: so alts can get the gear right @Towelliee does that confirmed since ksm is acc bound?
[5:51:18] zeviika: I’ve been playing too much ffxiv lately to even care for going for ksm. I should eventually
[5:51:25] yunggluten: There's a huge portion of the population that's hard stuck between 195 and 205. That group doesn't really get helped by the new valor system
[5:51:32] warrenny: @dreadlp Ksm makes keys easier
[5:51:36] Balzofsteels: i think that loot systeme ATM is pretty decent... people are used to get free gear now that they have to work for it they cry

[5:51:41] keeindordel: @Baleroc1 no dude th ewhole campaign for ur covenant was to help unite the covenants to face the forces of the Maw
[5:51:41] warrenny: @dreadlp io sorry
[5:51:46] Lemonmunch3r: What is ksm?
[5:51:48] Keyastaron_: FUCK THAT
[5:51:52] Darkb4ne_: lol no way
[5:51:53] Roffasauras: it's already going to take forever to even upgrade gear at this rate
[5:51:55] hoyhoy007: what is KSM
[5:51:56] keeindordel: @Lemonmunch3r KEYSTONE MASTER
[5:51:58] PvtHudson093: @Lemonmunch3r key stone master
[5:51:59] Darkb4ne_: KSM is account wide
[5:52:01] Keyastaron_: @Lemonmunch3r Key stone master time 15 keys
[5:52:01] balart: @Towelliee that's going to be the case 100% lol you have to be naive to think it will be account wide
[5:52:02] Lemonmunch3r: Oh fuck
[5:52:05] giggz91: @Towelliee you dont even need a lot of gear to get ksm idk people just make it hard
[5:52:09] dutchie76: KSM is every dungeon done at 15
[5:52:11] Dinermoe: it is accountwide
[5:52:19] giggz91: you can be 195+ and get it
[5:52:20] GnomeLickerGames: @Balzofsteels i dont think its about working for it but when i run the same run 7 times and get no drops that feels like a waste
[5:52:23] MuttonChopins: people will just say see you till 9.1
[5:52:28] Eviltuna13: So only people who do mythic plus can upgrade gear? No valor from normal and heroics?
[5:52:32] balart: @Towelliee just take in consideration the pvp upgrading system
[5:52:36] idenkaz_: all this does is to further the gap even more between them and casuals ... gj blizzard.
[5:52:41] c4mmweir: Wait what’s KSM
[5:52:42] Dinermoe: it's probably linked to the achievement, so when it's accountwide you dont have to worry
[5:52:44] Bigirishred: but pvp rating isn't account wide so why would it be different for KSM?
[5:52:52] yunggluten: @Eviltuna13 No valor for anything outside of Mythics
[5:52:56] Lupusdeus: Lupusdeus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[5:52:57] Hitokiri83: @Towelliee did you see the Mortal Kombat movie trailer
[5:53:02] balart: @Towelliee it does, it's not account wide that's what I'm trying to tell you ksm upgrading will no be account wide
[5:53:04] Dinermoe: @bigirishred because the achievement is accountwide
[5:53:18] Eviltuna13: @yunggluten wow that sucks
[5:53:29] balart: @Towelliee hopefully you are right, but blizzard is dumb as fuck lol
[5:53:36] keeindordel: @Baleroc1 jfc u r a lost cause pay attention to the lore of the game you're currently playing
[5:53:41] Vorog1: Bring back Badge of Justice for casuals
[5:53:42] drs031: @Towelliee love you keeping it real right now
[5:53:47] Mecabeast: Mecabeast subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! we should of had the valor system since launch
[5:53:49] Dinermoe: the achievement IS accountwide
[5:53:57] Darkb4ne_: all top players in logs are using pvp gear
[5:54:02] Dinermoe: thats why you could complete it withj multiple characters
[5:54:02] yunggluten: @Eviltuna13 I dont think so at all. Mythic 0 or +2 is super easy. There's no reason heroics or normals should award the best possible gear
[5:54:14] comato4st: Just unsub and play a game that rewards skill/time invested 4Head
[5:54:16] Lemonmunch3r: Would it be crazy to make PvP gear shit in PvE?
[5:54:21] Metket: i know ppl fail at +2
[5:54:25] Eziak: We 100 will
[5:54:27] Eviltuna13: Ok

[5:54:43] Theduskflyer: But you cant even upgrade the CURRENT gear you have. what good does that do us?
[5:54:47] racketpunch: it is a crappy valor system. rng will still hold us back from getting the pieces we need
[5:54:47] Kael88: I've done De Other Side at 15+ over 30 times this season and still haven't got the tank trinket
[5:54:49] Darkb4ne_: who tf fails a +2
[5:54:50] Cafe0le: but pvp is harder and you have to put up with a more toxic environment
[5:54:56] Todmeister9000: I'm a blood elf

[5:55:32] Lazugo: @Kael88 you still need to get it after valor anyway so yeah...
