[0:05:13] SupR3m3PriM3: "Give me a second, guys," Soda says. "Gotta hit up the bathroom" He turns down the volume on his microphone, and immediately gives the birds a swift kick down. As the birds yelps loudly in pain, Soda overturns the nearest chair, yelling "Fuck this game!" as loudly as he can. Vei tries to calm him down, but Soda swiftly bodyslams her onto a glass coffee table. After taking a few deep breaths, Soda wipes the blood off of his face, sits back down at his computer, and resumes his sponsored stream.
