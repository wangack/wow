[1:36:59] JC0830: @desiheat final example on the maturity/growth subject. I've seen people who seemed to have found who they want to be early in life, and simply built on that. They changed a little bit over the years, but matured years before then.

[2:37:27] Lichcult: @JC0830 was it 3 power chords?
[2:38:13] JC0830: @lichcult the majority of it was TBH. The solos covered pretty well tho.
[2:38:17] Lichcult: @JC0830 there are so many sub genres and sometimes  you don't need flashy stuff to make a good tune, but at the same time there are so many metal bands that have insane arrangements/technique
[2:38:55] Lichcult: @JC0830 and to water it down/simplify it like that is wrong lol. even iconic bands like iron maiden, etc prove that wrong. masterful musicians
