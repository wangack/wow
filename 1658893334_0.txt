[0:46:29] AutumnReds: AutumnReds subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! ohm. [ ≈çm ] The SI derived unit used to measure the electrical resistance of a material or an electrical device

[0:47:08] cabalish: it is a unitr for electrical resistance
[0:47:29] AutumnReds: higher the ohms better the sound experience; that is dependent on if you‚Äôre using the appropriate amp to provide the required power, 100 ohms headphones plugged into a laptop will not get you the experience you expected, as most laptops support an impedance of only up to 32 ohms.
[0:47:33] Nimz83: I think high ohm headsets may require some form of amplification, but will produce better sound

[2:30:46] JuceAUS: i reckon my taste buds got better after eating spicy food
[2:30:49] ColdofSIM: I lost most of my taste buds after covid sadly
[2:30:53] TheXjed: @91Niki @MilesKG21 pls stop backing up the idea of monthly sub, it's archaic idea that should be long gone in a game with microtransactions, dude is right.
[2:30:57] Aidler: I think nobody can tolerate the Reaper as if it‚Äôs nothing
[2:30:58] falldrgn: Imean if you eat spicy like SUPER SUPER SUPER hot stuff all day everyday yeah

[2:31:02] thecynicalshuffler: trinidad scorpion is fucking hot as hell
[2:31:05] 3663Sharad: The taste buds logic would imply that all asian / thai people can't taste anything. Indian food also spicy if you want
[2:31:05] MILESkg21: spicy mayo MY FUCKIN SIDES KEKW
[2:31:07] Dreyahri: yea! besides the stomach issues lul

[2:33:21] SirVoro: is the gifted sub pet up now or is that on launch?
[2:33:22] Zilberg: $15 a month isn't a lot but it helps deter a lot of bots.. not all bots obviously.. but a lot
[2:33:23] hxrvick: SWTOR's sub gave you every single xpac and 2 free max boosts for free and most still stayed free
[2:33:24] PadidinJones: I cant do spicy. I have gastro issues that flare the fuck up when I eat too much spicy
[2:33:24] EpicJune: i think if games offered optional subs, most would go for it imho
[2:33:31] ColdofSIM: Most other MMo dont give as much cool skins in game without in-game cash shop
[2:33:43] Alepouditsa: @TheXjed i like the monthly fee this way the are no loot box's
[2:34:04] Zilberg: SWTOR died.. so comparing wow to SWTOR is not it

[3:26:40] JFeezy__: did my first pet battle ever this weekend. LUL
[3:26:43] Zilberg: Nah because other games make you go into their game to claim it.. No shot you can claim something through Twitch
[3:26:58] EpicJune: @EpicJune what for drops? Never noticed it. Only seen the points claim button tbh
[3:27:03] Dragonkiller1974: for the ppl complaining about having to claim shit just remember the wow anniversary used to be only one day if you didnt log on that day you got shit
[3:27:28] Incredible_Sausage: it's supposed to be an event to partake in
[3:27:33] Featherbow: @EpicJune click your profile picture at the top of the page, click drops and rewards
[3:27:38] Short_Film: will we still get the drops if we dont have a current sub to WoW?
[3:28:00] Nerdmeat_: WoW Players can read?
[3:28:01] cahoots82: @Biby07 That's not true. They definitely expire.
[3:28:05] realnzall: @Towelliee Seeing you run back in Moonkin form instead of Cat form makes me want to backseat game
[3:28:07] CDubTheRIPper: if you havent had to claim a drop from at least one game then you havent been on twitch long lol
[3:28:08] School_Toilets: Pretty sure some players will miss the feldrake and will cause a huge drama about it
[3:28:09] Kasaiya13: that dragon kite pet was on the bm ah on eu the day after drops stopped
[3:28:09] WowGrl: I had an issue where my 3 months account showed connected on both sides but when it came time to claim the pet, Twitch was unconnected.  I had to re-do everything on a different account.
[3:28:13] AvrithSATX: At some point I wonder where people actually have to accept responsibility for not reading the plethora of instructions provided.
[3:28:14] Alaquane: I do not have a current subscription to wow. I claimed the pet and logged into a level 20 character and had the pet
[3:28:25] Dreyahri: i do think there is a deadline to claim them in game
[3:28:35] Dreyahri: its somewhere in november
[3:28:45] Kelticlore: @short_film you can log into wow with out a sub on a toon thats lvl 20 or lower
[3:28:52] Featherbow: @FaithanUchi they go in your collections tab in gaem
[3:28:56] toffeeswirl: Well hopefully if they didn't get the pet they learned what to do for the mount drop :)
[3:29:02] KwaT007: Hearthstone had drops
[3:29:03] Fox808: don't forget about linking account part :P
[3:29:06] Dreyahri: so end of this month, i think if you would buy the game when it releases and try toclaim them then, it will be gone
[3:29:07] ZeroNpcTV: who doesnt claim their free gifts KEKW
[3:29:28] EvilMalek: twitch does send a notification to claim
[3:29:29] guyb2k9: Toweliee have you done the spam your alts farm on the event ? is it quick ?
[3:29:40] Dreyahri: @Featherbow oh chill, and they will stay there? i thought i read that they will disappear from your collection tab  if you don't redeem them by the end of november

[4:38:18] pereadin: Speaking of aggro, there‚Äôs a bunch of aggro issues going on in Nokhud on beta right now. Mobs completely dropping threat on tanks and killing dps/ me. It was wild. Couldn‚Äôt figure out why.

[4:39:54] ElmSpace: They also reduced the tag number for 15 people I believe
[4:39:58] vic_ave: best to be in a group of 4
[4:40:10] Sepaodan: The Ice are bugged the water elem are 60 and not sync with your level
[4:40:14] AamiraCat: I ran as feral yesterday 30-60 took 2 hours. Just kept swiping and pulling mobs to the groups who were killing. No group lol

[4:54:51] MrHI6HWAY: good
[4:54:54] piratechris: Makes sense cause the 95% pay more of the bills I guess
[4:54:54] Zilberg: That's how FF14 is
[4:54:56] TheDos13: Degen mode in Legion was legit scary
[4:54:58] bcrums101: So what, is it NOT normal to put 80 hours/week into WoW and then burn out for a year?

[4:57:04] SnuxyGG: towHi
[4:57:10] Nerdmeat_: Literally me
[4:57:11] hickey7979: i am that casual guy
[4:57:14] Eraste: after finally getting to mess around with soar this past week, im super hyped to check out dragon riding. not a big raiding/hardcore player
[4:57:21] DeanoTV: @Kelticlore DF has that with the renown (rep) system
[4:57:40] Aidler: I never had a problem with that as a very casual player
[4:57:43] conv3rge_: metrics driven content
[4:57:51] trinita299: true
[4:57:54] JackedDown: That's what blew my mind, how long it took them to change it
[4:58:10] trinita299: im that casual player ... game is 2 big
[4:58:11] Zilberg: Trying to get Bobbys boat as big as possible before he goes
[4:58:15] mrfear420: easier . lol . it was already easy
[4:58:17] Finansdepartementet: thats a huge fuckin mug
[4:58:18] TheDos13: Talent Trees are definitely not a win for casual players
[4:58:21] mrfear420: talent system
[4:58:22] Kelticlore: @DeanoTV i know just saying its a System there brinign back which i felt they should of kept
[4:58:39] rillo5: They had that mindset of we should want to play the game exactly how we are told to for a while
[4:58:46] SimplyRed: What are your thoughts on the "damage" being already done and its too late for many?
[4:58:46] DeanoTV: @TheDos13 ur joking right? people been begging for old talent trees for YEARS
[4:58:48] Namtarts_TV: talent trees are super casual friendly
[4:58:49] Mahal_11532: I was a heavy grinder but I'm ready for a break / change of pace
[4:58:50] dianthusnemo: talent trees : you just go to a guide and copy a setup - done :)

[4:58:59] DeanoTV: new trees are the best thing thats happened
[4:59:03] Chiraakitteh: I love the legion weapons, but they could have capped the artifact power once you unlocked everything
[4:59:03] Skylin3r: casual player googles an import code
[4:59:14] tanek1966: Talent Trees are easy for casuals. Just go to Wowhead, click on the export button and then import.
[4:59:19] zombie_snacks666: I'm a very casual player these days and the talent trees where one of the reasons why I'm back to start playing some more
[4:59:20] captain_khyzan: I feared the new talent trees at one time... but they are not as bad as they look just poke around in it for like 10mins and ur good
[4:59:23] Zerref87: the player base has wanted talent trees back since they left, one of the most requested things besides housing
[4:59:27] 91Niki: @TheDos13 Not true. Casual players can still go on wowhead if the trees are overwhelming. Not to mentioned they come with a beginner setup. AND they can build their own if they want to
[4:59:29] SouvlakiTheBest: as a causal player, the systems are not what kept me from playing the game.
[4:59:30] nohemoglibin: busted.
[4:59:31] MrHI6HWAY: wow for me is like the people who play sports games that release every year. they know im gonna play it
[4:59:37] bcrums101: After being gone a long time, in 2 weeks I got flying and all story done in Zereth
[4:59:44] Aidler: I don‚Äôt raid besides LGR, don‚Äôt M+ and don‚Äôt PvP‚Ä¶. hmmm
[4:59:47] Eraste: i did that for evoker lol, was a little too overwhelming at first to read through it all
[4:59:47] TheDos13: @DeanoTV i know people have been asking for them, i dont thin its a straight up win for casuals, think its a better change for the 5%
[4:59:51] Bernardo994: seriously this will be the time i will play alts
[4:59:54] 91Niki: Yeah I am really looking forward to a super alt friendly exp

[5:00:41] deathdealer75: Kadgar popping in like Doc Brown
[5:00:53] ivy_xxo: ivy_xxo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:00:54] Kelticlore: IF there arent any yet i expect Talent Tree setups to do speed clears of old content to make it more efficient soon
[5:00:57] kashmara: with BFA you could get a new character geared up in like 20 mins with world quests
[5:01:02] EvilMalek: I want to slide out a portal like khadgar
[5:01:02] bcrums101: NGL I did love the corrupted borrowed power in Nzoth era ;) I was getting to 1m DPS LOL
[5:01:08] SK1NFATHER: Lost Ark did account-wide prog really well. Glad Blizz adapted a bit. Alts were a pain in the balls this xpac
[5:01:11] PvtHudson093: oh they will complain becuase its not wow unless people are complaining
[5:01:11] The_Nantz: The rock has come back to Azeroth
[5:01:11] TheDos13: I think Dragonflight is kind of like a soft-reset in terms of their design philosphy

[5:03:28] carmelchaos: Definately going to try and be a tailor/chanter. I dont raid anymore outside of some M+, will be cool to have some decent gear I can work at
[5:03:28] Teknofear64: Is there a mission table in DF?
[5:03:29] Aidler: But I can‚Äôt use the gear I produce myself‚Ä¶.

[5:05:04] dexterqt: is DF going to revive wow for casuals?
[5:05:07] gold9871: dh is fun

[5:05:43] Sathfire: @Sathfire haha awesome
[5:06:00] TheDos13: @Sathfire its because crafted gear has been garbage outside of the borrow power items
[5:06:24] Poisonblack44: ?

[5:11:28] Dreyahri: nah its also very gpu intensive to have that many visuals loaded
[5:11:31] SK1NFATHER: prolly at the same time lol
[5:11:31] digitard: 50/50 they launch at 3pm... they often get delays on expansion releases
[5:11:33] Skylin3r: most mmo's are CPU bound
[5:11:33] Dreyahri: cpu intensive *
[5:11:34] infinityarty: there is no way wow is capping out a 3090 or higher on gpu
[5:11:37] MILESkg21: MMO'S are all CPU Heavy anyway
[5:11:44] ElDrakenMan: isnt wow more cpu based?
[5:11:48] cptrogers123: My pc can play warzone with no lags and 100-110 fps...  When playing wow it lags as soon i go into raids LUL
[5:11:49] conv3rge_: WoW is all about that CPU. x3d chips are so good for it
[5:11:53] Skylin3r: ESO feels the most optimized
[5:11:53] Bernardo994: this has been my blight since launch
[5:11:54] digitard: Yeah, the wow engine is so old its still crazy cPU bound.
[5:11:57] lel3owski: it's server too though right
[5:12:12] infinityarty: my 3090 gets like 25ish on there
[5:12:13] rediils: why i asked earlier
[5:12:14] digitard: I still get hit with an overclocked 5800x, but definitely was way worse on my 7700K
[5:12:18] Skylin3r: well
[5:12:21] Dreyahri: because everyone is loading their stuff to the server, and your cpu is trying to process that with your hdd or ssd, even when you have a 4090, your cpu can cut your graphhical performance down
[5:12:23] MILESkg21: maybe someday they will update to this decades standards
[5:12:24] spacemunky114: the only thing I need to upgrade is ram, got this pc when things were selling for astronomically high so the most viable option was a 'prebuild'
[5:12:38] gankinpwn: i dont lag at all or see cpu drops with my 3070
[5:12:38] Skylin3r: GW2 not really, even with DX11 i get the same in cities
[5:12:43] digitard: I wouldn't doubt that the next expansion after DF will end up with new engine stuff once MS takes over.
[5:12:47] Skylin3r: well being honest FFXIV is
[5:12:50] Eraste: ff14 does well with those big fate battles
[5:12:52] bigxukdog: @Towelliee hey do both evoker specs have bloodlust?
[5:13:08] Nerdmeat_: Yeah Farming Simulator looks great on my 3090ti
[5:13:15] Featherbow: @citrineson you can't really cheat. exploits get you banned hard.
[5:13:17] digitard: I'd really be surprised if MS didn't use one of their crazy well done engines (the Forza engine is supposed to be SUPER flexible and is being used on a lot of games now) and replace the wow engine within 2yrs of the aquisition
[5:13:28] c0mmander_starscream: WoW Quantum is DF killer
