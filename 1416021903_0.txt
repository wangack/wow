[1:11:36] JrocThaGreat: @KragnosWoW a bias, then either way not likling a movie does have to do anything with that acting in it? its like saying a game is bad, because its not genre you play. But iether its early have a nice day lol

[1:41:11] Tydro: Red portal is a boss
[1:41:12] headshot_hunter6: red is secret boss
[1:41:13] LimitedVoid78: red is a boss
[1:41:15] NexusHunter69: hello everyone i got a question about lost ark if anyone can answer it.. my question is the chaos dungeon is it possible to solo it?
[1:41:20] RedTanukii: is a boss
[1:41:25] CritcobainTV: They're not just hunting gold portals. The fastest way to farm the mats to buy the honing stuff from the vendor is to skip the last stage because it takes twice as long as the other floors and u get 1/3 less mats apparently
[1:41:30] OvenMonkeyGaming: @NexusHunter69 yes
[1:41:34] Berfometh904: @NexusHunter69 yes
[1:41:37] CritcobainTV: at least that's what people say, idk
[1:41:40] Tydro: Like an actual raid boss scaled to solo / party size

[1:42:23] mmo_kenna_: I wouldn't be surprised if they change it, players quitting group isn't a great meta
[1:42:37] cronladd: im pretty sure you can solo chaos dunegeons. but it isnt recommended since you cant respawn.
[1:42:41] thedreamplateau: Any pvp?
[1:42:45] cronladd: in solo^
[1:43:01] cronladd: could be wrong tho fact check me char
[1:43:08] CritcobainTV: chaos dungeons are a joke

[1:44:08] NexusHunter69: @OvenMonkeyGaming @Berfometh904 thank you for the info i'm still new on the game 2 days old but i've already reached lvl 50 so i was looking for the gear grinding basically instead of buying the gear

[1:45:11] erkythejerky: @Towelliee hey if u could design a class to bring into lost ark what would it be? (if u dont see this all g lol)
[1:45:19] fewyn: torghast should have been chaos dungeons
[1:45:20] OvenMonkeyGaming: no one should be infinite farming t3 chaos just go get alts to t3 much better use of time
[1:45:20] S_CoR: yoink
[1:45:55] GrimMSickles: 1 for 3 so far today might not be a good day

[1:47:06] nawori: @Towelliee  you get them from lullaby isle and when you get 3 of them you turn them in for a new song
[1:47:08] NexusHunter69: @OvenMonkeyGaming i see. that is fine my ilvl is just passing 265 so as long as it's not weapon i get i'll be fine lol
[1:47:11] Tydro: @OvenMonkeyGaming hardcore mentalty says... INCRESE MY ILVL FOR BIG D NUMBERS, they go banannas on farm and get burned soon
[1:47:16] twistedstick1: I forgot where I parked my boat. doh
[1:47:16] KragnosWoW: @boblongmvp make sure to join a full group
[1:47:16] 7_Temp: you need 3x total voice of the forest
[1:47:35] 7_Temp: what you don't party for the dps at lullaby
[1:47:58] nawori: That song is needed for many moko seeds and other things aswell so id suggest going into the secret entrance on lullaby isle every 2h when it opens.
[1:48:03] OvenMonkeyGaming: @OvenMonkeyGaming yeah sadly ilvl doesnt equate to dmg at this point in the game better gear and engravings
[1:48:35] OvenMonkeyGaming: yes

[1:48:52] OvenMonkeyGaming: yeah
[1:48:57] JrocThaGreat: most arent tradeable tho
[1:49:12] nawori: @Towelliee  In korea a trader was implemented where you could exchange T1-T2 mats for T3 and T4 later
[1:49:17] amonamarth3: quick question, are there 3 people fore the abyss dungeon Hall of twisted warlords
[1:49:37] OvenMonkeyGaming: @boblongmvp class engraving and primary engraving ( percise dagger ) other than that wouldnt worry to much in t1 and 2
[1:49:48] Bogzeh: no wtf, that has to be troll saying to buy chaos shards for gold
[1:49:53] OvenMonkeyGaming: @Towelliee N
[1:49:57] OvenMonkeyGaming: dont buy
[1:49:59] CritcobainTV: It's over by Lullaby Island @Towelliee Kappa

[1:50:02] Bogzeh: no?
[1:50:03] chriar: So troll
[1:50:05] ClassicMalcontent: Vendor
[1:50:13] sklingel: why not just convert gold to silver?
[1:50:21] ClassicMalcontent: There's a vendor for them.
[1:50:30] srtszr89: SEA
[1:50:31] OvenMonkeyGaming: they do but you could convert gold to silver
[1:50:37] N3llee: if you want to pay more sure
[1:50:40] Bogzeh: just buy them for silver its low cost, buying for gold is troll
[1:50:45] zer0jay: it's the opposite, gold is more valuable
[1:50:55] ClassicMalcontent: Wait. I am not T3 what are you saving silver for T3 gems refaceting at some point?
[1:50:57] wojek78: why yould you not use your silver lol
[1:51:06] OvenMonkeyGaming: @ClassicMalcontent everything lol
[1:51:18] JrocThaGreat: lol gold is way more valuable
[1:51:24] ClassicMalcontent: I know there are ingredients worth like 1 million silver and such.
[1:51:59] Bogzeh: silver u cant buy, ppl know something, but not worth buying those with gold
