[8:30:20] MadeOne: People posting those gifs on twitter saying it was clearly a bug are so triggering. You can see the bear was repositioned and taking damage when they lost the monk and paladin (which is what caused the wipe). The monk didn't get healed before roar, and the paladin stood in the explosion. Bad play rewarded.
