[1:51:38] struci: New World Gathering was insanely satisfying
[1:51:40] carrioncorps: @bassiemon123 thats awesome asf dude ngl! cave base is 100% on my list of things to do too haha. Yeah its actually insane how they managed to do that, the game is basically a triple A version of Valheim and im down for that all day lol
[1:51:45] KoperHS: What you think about 40 energy Mutilate p2? Better then backstab for pvp?

[1:53:08] carrioncorps: i really hope AoC is a good game, it looks so complicated and with the whole lord system and land ownership.. could get scuffed
[1:53:36] Nikerto: @carrioncorps age of conan? Pog
[1:53:48] carrioncorps: i can see the biggest streamer on each server ending up as the lord for an area etc. idk could be weird is all

[1:56:00] FreddiFish07: we must survive the trenches in siberia to play AoC

[2:04:03] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety
[2:04:14] bassiemon123: Huh
[2:04:23] 23rhz: it starts it over again
[2:04:33] 23rhz: so in some weird way some warriors stopped doing dmg
[2:04:33] carrioncorps: i dont think he's playing with his food lol, he's conserving his HP to not take uneccesary dmg
[2:04:43] 23rhz: in the end of an encounter

[4:21:03] koboldich: ALOO
[4:21:17] big_lebowski_69: @Ashamintallu the battery dies pretty quick

[4:21:46] Leadstar1212: @PsheroTV Did you buy a tickets for you and Martina for the rock concerts in July?
[4:22:04] big_lebowski_69: bumps kill battery, you need perfect roads

[4:24:59] krontos7717: EVs are shit. A lot of production waste for their batteries, then Noone buys them as they lose range af and they turn into waste faster and its hard to recycle batteries
[4:25:06] elessar_jk2: i promise its clean
[4:25:07] ev3rlasting4: Loud, smelly, most eco-unfriendly, more expensive. Diesel should be banned.

[8:09:13] AnthonySo1337: the only difference between alcohol is the sugar contents
[8:09:22] Drezzi_: @ModulatedTransceiver how to blackout and embarrass yourself
[8:09:27] aVeryGoodMann: but beer has lots of calories, maybe does something else

[8:09:37] nailerak: alcohol has to have the shittiest LD50 to feel-good ration out of all drugs
[8:09:39] bassiemon123: @drezzi_ took em for 3,5 year. Had bunch of side effects. Blurry vision, headache, concentrate problem. Quit and started smoking weed, never had a problem after that.
[8:09:45] thrixog: Im perscribed adhd meds and they do help but I tend to lean on them as a crutch which I dont like
[8:09:50] zerohot89: The concentration is the difference %
[8:09:55] Drezzi_: @bassiemon123 and that helped ur adhd somehow?
[8:09:58] noctu_ary: it's alcohol yes, but the geometry of molecules can vary, causing different effects on you
[8:10:03] StreamElements: üì∏ https://www.instagram.com/psherotv/ for Kote heroKOTE and IRL stuff.
[8:10:12] noctu_ary: it has been illegal in the past tho @PsheroTV
[8:10:17] guni1980: It would be like a chemical :P
[8:10:19] xsv_21: alcohol is the worse drug and the TRUE gateway drug imo - it was just grandfathered into society
[8:10:30] jazni_23: every person is 100% unique and whether alcohol/drugs is good or bad depends on how the person uses them
[8:10:31] AnthonySo1337: alcohol shouldnt be legal at all its actual poison, but your liver happens to convert it to save your life
[8:10:46] chirsen: @vexile_23 yip, agree that
[8:10:50] Drezzi_: apparently the american prohibition failed really hard, if it had continued i wonder if drinking culture would be gone by now
[8:10:56] struci: it's crazy to me that smoking, on average, nullifies all the health advancements we've made over hundreds of years
[8:11:00] struci: and people still do it voluntarily
[8:11:12] bassiemon123: @drezzi_ yes for me it helps. Not sure if it will for everyone.
[8:11:22] Johnnymo1010: is the possible 40 energy mut in p2 a meme ?
[8:11:24] Drezzi_: drinking is one of those things that people THINK they cant do, but if they went without it for long enough, they would be fine and not miss it, like sugar etc
[8:11:37] zerohot89: Your own body produce alcohol too,
[8:11:40] zerohot89: ;)
[8:11:51] aVeryGoodMann: @struci sometimes u want to kill stress/anxiety in any way possible
[8:12:02] struci: @struci yeah killing yourself surely helps
[8:12:11] bassiemon123: LUL
[8:12:20] bassiemon123: Thats a little fkt up
[8:12:41] AnthonySo1337: sanest sober response
[8:12:44] AnthonySo1337: Kappa
[8:12:45] aVeryGoodMann: u dont eat a bag of candies when bored??
[8:13:07] struci: oh yes I meant "killing yourself by smoking surely helps" in a sarcastic way
[8:13:11] struci: sorry if that came out wrong

[8:13:30] cryshardcore: watch outta
[8:13:33] StreamElements: Check your posture, you lovely person heroW
[8:13:39] AnthonySo1337: You probably sit too long, even if its your job
[8:13:45] aVeryGoodMann: @struci then you don't know how addiction works
[8:13:50] jazni_23: exercise can be hard on your body, self destructive
[8:13:54] AnthonySo1337: gamer elbow
[8:13:59] bassiemon123: What kind of exercise u do?
[8:14:06] bassiemon123: Weights?
[8:14:11] nailerak: bro don't fuck with that I had to do elbow surgery after climbing too much
[8:14:14] AmaIek_: I have the same problem when I am doing bouldering
[8:14:15] Drezzi_: definitely sitting at a desk all day is self destructive, but we all do that
[8:14:19] urudliv: its called tennis elbow, strengthen ur upper forearm muscles
[8:14:20] bassiemon123: Hmm
[8:14:34] mouchov: does it proc on critical hit
[8:14:39] struci: i didn't see‚Ä¶ elbow pain in your mouse arm?
[8:14:52] Istunlocklocalpensioners: it will heal
[8:14:56] zerohot89: It is probably neurv
[8:15:03] urudliv: itll only heal thru slow scaling ligament conditioning
[8:15:03] StreamElements: Check out my Merch here! -> https://merch.streamelements.com/psherotv
[8:15:11] AnthonySo1337: its probably related to holding your arm in that position/rubbing against desk
[8:15:24] Heresjohnny_421: damn man everytime i watch you, dealing with stream sniping. atleast it looks like it
[8:15:41] Istunlocklocalpensioners: best thing is to keep using it tbh
[8:15:44] zerohot89: by a Neurobex, it will help you. Vitamin B complex!
[8:15:48] Istunlocklocalpensioners: not overuse it ofc just keep it active.
[8:16:06] struci: is it there? https://i.imgur.com/KvAGGop.png
[8:16:44] struci: does it hurt when you turn it?
[8:16:50] struci: as in: thumb up or thumb to the side
[8:16:57] Istunlocklocalpensioners: few weeks it will be fine
[8:16:57] AnthonySo1337: could be tension in your shoulder making your arm tight
[8:17:02] struci: okay then it's not tennis arm
[8:17:05] martinsprey: what type of exercise did you do?
[8:17:12] zerohot89: ligament inflammation
[8:17:13] struci: could be rotary cuff
[8:17:21] radioraheemsboombox: Need a teaspoon of cement @PsheroTV
[8:17:30] xsv_21: flared elbows will do that
[8:18:10] bassiemon123: Ye thats why i dont use weights anymore. Its so ez to fk ur body upm
[8:18:14] bassiemon123: Just using the rubber bands/body weight rn
[8:18:14] zerohot89: Vitamin B complex will force the healing!
[8:18:23] AnthonySo1337: if its your right arm, with your mouse id almost bet its coming from the shoulder
[8:18:26] martinsprey: you probly eat chicken/fish so it will go away
[8:18:37] urudliv: it can become inflammed if stress is continued
[8:19:00] Drezzi_: @bassiemon123 yeh but u cant get gigajacked without them
[8:19:03] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety

[8:20:45] AnthonySo1337: carpal tunnel simulator
[8:20:46] nailerak: twisting blades?
[8:21:06] Lysandor1: I have experienced similar pain near the elbow (lower tricep) - try doing some light weight tricep extensions - multiple reps/sets and it should sort it out
[8:21:11] AnthonySo1337: you fried your mouse hand lmaooo
[8:21:11] bassiemon123: Oh thats pritty bad

[8:25:00] Swapzz_: i saw someone talking about mutilate being reduced to 40 energy...is this real?
[8:25:19] krontos7717: So i had additional power of season, but lvl 94 char if i remember correct
[8:25:36] Globalmaniak: You can ignore alot of mechanics with a mage fire armor
[8:25:37] eceria: I play the new season now, whirlwind barbarian is so fun, but you need good gear for it
[8:25:42] krontos7717: But its so hard to avoid her 1 shots
[8:25:50] krontos7717: I enjoyed the fight
[8:26:08] krontos7717: After multiple hours you learn how to avoid her shit
[8:26:24] wakenbake_au: @drezzi_ I can just yuumi now in dia and not decay while I recover
[8:26:28] krontos7717: And then at lvl 100 i just 1shot herüòÇ
[8:26:36] krontos7717: Skipped everything
[8:26:51] xsv_21: I think for pve at least, we'll prob just be backstab spec due to bleeds/poisons not applying to mechanicals + the set bonus giving you +5 dagger wep skill
