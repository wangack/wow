[1:06:50] AethrosTempest: this isn't directed at you Mes but I'm so tired of DH on ladder - no idea how it hasn't been addressed yet
[1:07:14] venruki: DH is fine @AethrosTempest we love it
[1:07:21] americanmoses18: direct it at mes its his fault @aethrostempest
[1:07:27] krome2dadome: @AethrosTempest i didn't realize how bad it was until i played some lower games with my buddies just now. was legit every single game
[1:07:34] americanmoses18: also dh is fine just kill them in game ezpz
[1:07:45] venruki: If you can stun a DH they just die instantly so
[1:07:50] venruki: Just something to keep in mind
[1:07:53] justjoshingyo: can we talk abou destro nerfs too =\
[1:07:58] krome2dadome: @venruki IF
[1:08:11] venruki: 1 stun on DH = dead
[1:08:21] venruki: It's the weakness of being such a glass cannon
[1:08:30] venruki: rukiSmug
[1:09:06] healhut: rukiGrin
[1:09:23] venruki: 15% magic reduction :D
[1:09:32] krome2dadome: they need those tho
[1:09:47] krome2dadome: so that they don't instantly die in a stun
[1:10:02] americanmoses18: again just stun a dh its easy
[1:10:04] AethrosTempest: I particularly love how Necrotic Aura got nerfed to 4% and chaos brand + throw glaive pvp talent just... exists
[1:10:08] Drathimos: both realz classes have 4% vers talent HMMMM
[1:10:33] Drathimos: @AethrosTempest chaotic imprint is the #1 dps culprit for dhs imo
[1:10:39] Drathimos: if anything needs a nerf its that
[1:10:41] krome2dadome: warr has 1% vers for 1 point :) basically the same thing
[1:10:53] americanmoses18: war too op nerf them
[1:10:56] americanmoses18: dh fine
[1:11:09] sunileif: nerf dh war rogue
[1:11:31] sunileif: they need to be bottom pvp parse NODDERS
[1:11:39] americanmoses18: nerf dk as well fuck em
[1:11:46] AethrosTempest: i've just been bouncing between 2.2 and 2.3 playing unholy/dev and it's been just impossible to climb. Part of that I guess is our fault for playing so off-meta but still
[1:11:52] sunileif: nah just nerf chillstreak then they be alright
[1:12:06] venruki: unholy/dev = no dh/outlaw/destro = lose
[1:12:11] venruki: unfortunately
[1:12:17] maik0pl: What addon displays all the buffs and debuffs above characters

[1:13:24] venruki: as a frost mage i know what its like to be completely worthless in 3v3
[1:13:26] sunileif: its not Cfists?
[1:13:36] AethrosTempest: @venruki yeah, my buddy's mental was taking big hits from not getting his title yet (playing mage/lock/disc) and I told him it wasn't his fault, just a very strict meta because the ladder is deflated. he queued rdru/destro/DH this week and got his mount/title already lmao
[1:13:42] healhut: nooo don't listen to ven. he crossed over to the darkside
[1:13:56] dawsonator171: @venruki you need to write the eulogy to give mesDK a proper sending off.
[1:14:06] maik0pl: I want to come back to wow, been few expansions, do I need to pve, quest, or do anything else besides PVP to gear for arena?

[4:58:16] addiiez: CC reduction isn't a issue, it's the AMOUNT of cc spells and the fact you can end up fear fear fear stun stun stun poly poly poly
[4:58:17] Drathimos: they reduced cc reduct but they gave classes more cc from other dr schools so it feels the same
