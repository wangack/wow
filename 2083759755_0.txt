[1:03:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: i'll probably level my ret in cata just in case i want to play ret in mop

[1:04:21] im_capy: Start a new toon in retail and your there now
[1:04:24] jasonbriggs: has hardcore self found mode come out yet
[1:04:27] luckfore: cuz it came out like 14 years ago
[1:04:32] Niksen_99: I agree its not classic. Wrath is barely classic
[1:04:37] im_capy: only difference, is difficulty scaling
[1:04:39] TwiceOneTime: but the game wasnt so face rolling easy as it is now.
[1:05:11] Molvonos: The concept is just too niche.
[1:05:19] CordovaGC: Cause it's the old version of wow....it's not like they can call it cata 2.0, people will be expecting to much with that.
[1:05:47] Niksen_99: Once they destroyed the barrens... its not classic anymore LUL
[1:05:51] im_capy: so Im guessing Void Storage is gone this time around
[1:06:09] TwiceOneTime: cata was pretty fun to level and quest in... retail is horrible to quest in. just pull the whole zone and take a nap. lol
[1:06:21] Kaykerrs: I totally forgot about Tol Barad
[1:06:22] Molvonos: @TwiceOneTime Cata was no different, what?

[1:10:36] Shamwise: kick master towelliee
[1:10:43] jasonbriggs: i struggled tanking as druid in caty
[1:10:48] Molvonos: Anyone who says that sh it was fun, is wearing those fucking rose tinted goggles.
[1:10:55] TwiceOneTime: i played a tank/healer then.
[1:10:55] Molvonos: 'MUH NOSTALGIA'
[1:11:28] Molvonos: Yea
[1:11:29] TwiceOneTime: yeah was crazy. but i ran with an IRL friend and some guildies.
[1:11:38] HaloS23: i remember stone cord being horrific
[1:11:41] HaloS23: core*
[1:11:49] Molvonos: That nonsense was dumb.  And since I was playing a warlock, I didnt have any real CC if I didnt use my Succubus.
[1:11:57] Molvonos: And that was some micromanaging I didnt care to do.
[1:12:05] im_capy: Arguably one of the worst launches for them because of all that.
[1:12:24] Molvonos: It was worse than Classic.

[1:15:35] krubzo: slow = cc to  , so all class have cc :p
[1:15:37] Molvonos: @Niksen_99 Fellhunter is not CC.  Succubus dies too fast to all the AoE nonsense and gets their CC disrupted, since it's from a secondary source.  Try again?
[1:15:47] jasonbriggs: i liked the harrison jones quest line in uldum

[1:59:02] ClassicMalcontent: It's amazing how bad some players still are.
[1:59:25] CrusaderNero: Hey whats going on?
[1:59:32] Molvonos: @ClassicMalcontent I mean, it's not exactly something that's in retail, so unless people were playing since classic, Hellfire's a pretty unique experience.
[1:59:45] Wulfgrym: @ClassicMalcontent games come and go, but stupid people are forever
[1:59:47] Molvonos: I kinda wish they'd have kept Hellfire in retail.

[2:01:17] Kneckt: Bedard is an insane player tbfh, 153 points in 50 odd games before being drafted is nuts
[2:01:22] ClassicMalcontent: @Molvonos true for some. Yet, particularly in SoD, even without having played OG or classic era before SoD I would expect them to just think "oh cool SoD things" and carry on ha ha.
[2:01:25] Rexy95: how is that so much ?
[2:01:31] Wulfgrym: most hyped since mcdavid i think
[2:01:31] ClassicMalcontent: @Wulfgrym ha indeed.
[2:02:08] Wulfgrym: @Rexy95 Bedard is the generational talent so his rookies are going to be Mcdavid level nuts
[2:02:14] force_FMD: glass jaw bedard
[2:02:28] DeepRespect14: It'll be interesting to see how his career plays out. Since he's already been hurt once hopefully he stays healthy

[2:02:53] Wulfgrym: you bought a case?

[2:07:25] force_FMD: crosby had bad problems with concussions early on also
[2:07:26] im_capy: @Kneckt agreed, but he should wear a cage imo

[2:17:00] KaisenSiru: Max tore him a new one with the react on the react
[2:17:10] Greencaps07: cause asmon blames the state of wow on the professional players. and i think max was saying even race wasnt happening they would be doing the same thing
[2:17:25] ctg_dreamz: Asmon drips the word professional with negative connotation when he says it. Basically he uses it to pit WF raiders against his chat
[2:17:28] ClassicMalcontent: @Yankozoid Searing Gorge but there is a passthrough from the Badlands into Searing Gorge in the lower-West corner
[2:17:30] B0MBsz: i want cata betaaa
[2:17:31] PigPenLen: He did imply Asmon doesnt like his life currently lol
[2:17:36] Rexy95: its the way asmon says it, and kinda shifts the "problems" with wow on max and all rwf
[2:17:38] eatclentrenh: the context is villinization of professional players

[2:55:31] expbottles: @kakotan2143 true
[2:56:01] force_FMD: they still going to beat star citizen
[2:56:02] Mister_Ript: Would rather a game take 7 years to make sure its done right, than deal with half-built Early Access games
[2:56:03] Murlocz: i feel like that also killed Crowfall
[2:56:15] Murlocz: it was like 10 years shit
[2:56:50] Kakotan2143: even time doesnt mean a game comes out good
[2:57:04] im_capy: I dont even feel like AoC has a unique art style tbh.
[2:57:07] Murlocz: yeah i agree
[2:57:17] Fastnik: What about bless online, wasn't that equal to crowfall

[2:57:54] vimie: the system reqs are going to screw them. Pretty much anyone can run Classic & most can run Retail
[2:58:01] Murlocz: holy shit thats SAD for like 10 years of work LUL
[2:58:09] Murlocz: thats insane tbh
[2:58:10] im_capy: Wayfinder comes to mind recently, not same, but still
[2:58:10] DecayedmiNt: Honestly, there isnt really anything left to do for MMORPGS that hasnt been done. Its not going to "peak" again
[2:58:25] Tecni: Did they just release it randomly? I never heard anything about Crowfall lol
[2:58:42] Murlocz: @towelliee Did Riot MMO got canceled?
[2:59:31] Energyzer9301: @Towelliee Have you gotten any Seattle Kraken cards so far from the NHL rips? ^^
[2:59:36] dracullus: oh yeah, that riot mmo which obviously will kill wow, almost forgot about it Kappa
[2:59:44] im_capy: Would you considered New World as a modern MMO failure
[2:59:50] Bon_Kley: do you think wow could benefit from an evolution if they moved away from instance based boss farming for gear progression? because i feel like that is all that retail is nowadays
[2:59:58] buhtterstick: knowledge is power
[3:00:02] vimie: I assumed the Riot MMO would be playable on Phones like Genshin. I dont expect too much
[3:00:05] Kneckt: a blue S lol

[3:01:22] dragonbard: I am surprised they did not bring in full areal battles in the battlegrounds honestly
[3:01:22] Bon_Kley: its true many mmos copy the gear and dungeon formula, but i think there could be a lot more room in it if devs tried?
[3:01:23] Murlocz: @towelliee Do you think New World could be a test for a major game like Lord of the Rings MMO from Amazon or some shit
[3:01:23] DunzoCD: please not open world runs like new world, it was fun the first few times then it got tedious
[3:01:58] belfastcl: @DunzoCD those always felt like scuffed versions of gw2 open world events
[3:02:33] Tecni: Do you think Wildstar would succeed if it came out now?
[3:02:47] Murlocz: i think that M+ is a system that really worked out well, to keep challenging players to push higher and higher
[3:03:39] im_capy: Im hoping with all this Ai video stuff, we can finally get another Warcraft movie
[3:03:48] carmelchaos: I feel like single player rpg games have more ways to improve then mmotpgs could for new features
[3:04:03] Murlocz: hero talents remember me Elite Specs from GW2, like necro being able to be reapers etc @towelliee

[3:04:22] zysmos: makes me think of counter strike, community cries for content and whenever valve release new maps and game modes nobody plays it and stick to the classic competitive defuse game mode
[3:04:29] DJ_PWNZ: @Towelliee you need to try star wars galaxies, it was ahead of its time
[3:04:33] ZealotryTV: wildstar classic when
[3:04:34] dracullus: hero talents is just "we dont want to mess with initial talents balance but need to give you something for 10 levels" + some proto class skin that could be expanded
[3:04:47] deepsOne: or star wars galaxies revamped
[3:04:56] im_capy: Runescape did that and now OSRS is the more popular version
[3:05:05] vimie: AI integration can make things interesting. On the fly content (bosses/zones?) that you can't google how to beat sorta thing.
[3:05:16] HaloS23: @Towelliee im curious about WOWs "air-lock" tech! What it is and what it will bring
[3:05:20] im_capy: I think older games are afraid to put money into new development this far out
[3:05:24] Bodhisage: real pain when you die in game nice
[3:05:32] tlsmith3638: we got to get int he matrix for the next MMO
[3:05:35] TheGiant99: Wouldn't it be safe to players are just wanting the expansion to hurry and get here
[3:05:54] Putcride: @towelliee what about an underwater mmo?
[3:05:54] deepsOne: killing 10 prettier boars
[3:05:55] PotbellyGoat: Star Wars galaxies with the player cities before the class revamp was one of the better MMOs
[3:06:00] Klarynse: Klarynse subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[3:06:02] im_capy: Retail looks prettier, and we see how many people still rather play classic versions
[3:06:02] Murlocz: well at the end of the day im gonna stick to good old WoW LUL
[3:06:13] belfastcl: gw2 tried underwater combat and it's not popular
[3:06:13] carmelchaos: Monsters and memories will ne the last mmorpg I'll try, though it's a long way away
[3:06:22] TheItalianStallion321: like, the entire game would be underwater? no thanks. i dont know how to swim

[3:06:31] im_capy: and whoever agrees, ban them
[3:06:33] tlsmith3638: a whole MMO as a water level i dont see that going well at all
[3:06:34] Wcvechten: Obviously, we the players need to be underwater and then play the  MMO
[3:06:37] Klarynse: yes sir!
[3:06:44] TheGamingDead: jar jar binks!
[3:06:45] Wulfgrym: underwater LUL
[3:06:55] TheGamingDead: lol
[3:07:19] vimie: do Zoomers like MMOs?
[3:07:31] Mister_Ript: ARK did underwater zones well.
[3:07:48] Wulfgrym: boomer and boomer
[3:07:50] Jango_: Safety's in the nfl are getting gutted right now
[3:07:52] Quojin: WoW had an underwater area and it was shit
[3:08:25] mawrgg: Tobo is 21
[3:08:28] Bon_Kley: for an example ashes of creation is doing node based cities that evolve based on player behaviour, i also like games where the gameplay evolves based on the players knowledge as it is in pvp games and tarkov has done this even in a pve game where the world is so detailed and has so many ways to interacte with that you still keep learning after 2000 hours, in wow i dont feel like i feel a lot after playing an expansion after 200 ish hours
[3:08:32] mawrgg: so yeah young lad in the wow sphere
[3:08:38] Bon_Kley: sry for long post
[3:08:38] im_capy: ya Tobo stared at 17
[3:08:41] Wulfgrym: my shoes are 21
[3:08:44] TheItalianStallion321: i wish i was younger. does that count? lol
[3:08:48] Jango_: i cant believe the broncos released Justin Simmons
[3:08:49] belfastcl: tobo paying taxes already, saving for retirement
[3:09:49] im_capy: New World had some upgrade town system too and they was meh
[3:09:51] Wulfgrym: @TheItalianStallion321 im young in my mind, does that count? LUL
[3:10:12] PigPenLen: yes, exactly.. that is what i fear as well in that game
[3:10:14] MortiousPrime: New World and Work Orders - those systems can't handle how players will actually act
[3:10:16] Mister_Ript: How different is that from the way New World leveled up settlements?
[3:10:19] PigPenLen: the human factor
[3:10:30] ZeusDNA: I do hope they nail the node/world changing features in Ashes. To have every server look different and unlock different things sounds cool.
[3:10:31] Wulfgrym: legend says, wow 2will launch before aoc
[3:10:41] im_capy: Gonna start seeing some Vegas lines.....what comes out first AoC or Star Citizen LUL
[3:10:51] chefsopa: Lol people comparing it to a game that haven't even come out officially xD
[3:11:05] belfastcl: they added townboards, like nw
[3:11:06] Wulfgrym: @im_capy ill get me some of that action
[3:11:07] Jango_: @im_capy AoC will come out first
[3:11:10] RagingPunk: wow 300% gold from quests pog
[3:11:12] DunzoCD: still remember people basically taking towns hostage in new world, all they would care about was pvp and never leveled anything up
[3:11:13] Bon_Kley: yea, i guess we will see the biggest evolution coming with ai in a couple of years
[3:11:19] Wulfgrym: star citizen is never coming out
[3:11:24] Murlocz: @towelliee Have you ever played Ragnarok Online?
[3:11:30] luckfore: we'll have legion classic by the time it comes out
[3:11:31] Dudutoolbox: you can already play star citizen, technically it's already a game
[3:11:46] belfastcl: @DunzoCD and the taxes, good luck if you bought a house before they raised them to hell
[3:11:50] Murlocz: yah exactly hahaha
[3:11:56] TheItalianStallion321: @Wulfgrym yes, yes it does lol
[3:11:59] Murlocz: it was cool tho, the pvp
[3:12:29] DunzoCD: @belfastcl exactly
[3:12:36] Dudutoolbox: @belfastcl just like irl LUL
[3:12:44] DecayedmiNt: Star Citizen is a fever dream that will never fully release. Chris Roberts likes adding more and more to the game

[3:23:09] force_FMD: it was
[3:23:13] polaropposite76: you should be able to view your history on kickstarter and see it
[3:23:21] force_FMD: i got a refund like 8-9 yrs ago before they stopped giving refunds
[3:23:39] belfastcl: people paid thousands for crowfall guild castles
[3:24:01] Wcvechten: Good thing you'll finally have the payoff in 40 years when you can finally play

[3:24:50] katcakesirl: can you even pre order ashes still or have they gotten rid of it?
[3:25:42] Steadmoh190: what if the studio goes bust will you get a refund for your founders pack
[3:25:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: THey are closing the window on buying alpha access
[3:26:31] blindedbyscience83: If it interests you at all, they dropped a new trailer for the Fallout tv show about an hour ago
[3:26:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not a fan of that kind of thing because it feels scammy even if it is helping their development process
[3:27:10] im_capy: People forget how much people were spending in games like Second Life.
[3:27:24] expbottles: man i wish fallout 76 was good
[3:27:25] katcakesirl: yeah i just checked the shop on there page and it looks like the starter packs are unavailable right now
[3:27:44] macmittens808: they know how to make money, honestly a good sign imo LuL
[3:27:49] Wcvechten: ofc gotta fund the scam aslong as you can

[3:28:32] expbottles: i think ima start a wrath char now to prep for cata
[3:28:54] Nokterian: Fallout tv show trailer looking fucking great
[3:29:04] Aproxys: question here! do you not feel burned out playing wow? i played since TBC, and i can only handle 1 month before i leave again :P
[3:29:12] belfastcl: the odd part was that none of the cosmetics even had 3d renders
[3:29:23] macmittens808: what did you like about the tanking there? haven't seen much besides some spell demos
[3:29:25] Nokterian: Ashes of creation? LUL
[3:29:48] im_capy: Star Citizen kickstarter said the same, and a lot didnt make it in

[3:35:20] im_capy: Creating an addict is easier said than done

[3:40:18] Mister_Ript: Vader is lame lol
[3:40:34] expbottles: ...
[3:40:57] macmittens808: twitch has somehow figured out how to show me ads on my vpn NotLikeThis
[3:40:59] Wcvechten: Joker is a card, therefore, darth vader wins
[3:40:59] Mister_Ript: In terms of character depth, Vader is a puddle and the Joker is the ocean.
[3:41:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: In theory Ashes will have a lot of content with like their caravan attacks and political systems, but I don't know if that can carry subs since not everyone can do it
[3:41:16] HaloS23: are oranges called orange because oranges are orange, or is orange called orange cause oranges are orange?

[3:42:04] expbottles: cody rhodes vs roman reigns who is winning
[3:42:43] Ganondood: the joker debuted in 1940... i dont think its a fair comparison, not even a fan of SW or joker but their mythos is in two diff worlds/sizes
[3:43:03] expbottles: @Ganondood good point
[3:43:29] expbottles: if the prequels never came out i would say Joker easily
[3:44:02] jarilrpg: also too many different versions of the joker

[3:56:08] im_capy: Cata datamining champ
[3:56:14] MrGM: Anytime
[3:56:15] Molvonos: That Vulpera got knocked the fuck out
[3:56:30] MrGM: There's a whole load of nothing exciting in those cata files
[3:56:54] im_capy: @MrGM o but we all know if there is, youll be the one to find it for us
[3:57:05] Molvonos: i imagine datamining Cata is like watching the directors cut of the Titanic.
[3:57:17] Molvonos: You know how it ends, you're just waiting for the extrenious shit
[3:57:28] fooxytv: @Molvonos LuL
[3:57:36] TheItalianStallion321: i actually never played Cata so im a little excited to play it
[3:57:50] Mister_Ript: Scrap LFR entirely.  Its 80% AFK people anyway.
[3:57:59] jkitchin75: no lfr ever
[3:58:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: they already said no lfr for the beginning raids
[3:58:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: if there is an lfr it would only be dragon soul
[3:58:25] jkitchin75: @Mister_Ript how about no
[3:58:28] Wcvechten: Hammer of fuck your face era mang
[3:58:37] im_capy: Cata was underrated, it got a bad launch and Dragon Soul didnt fair well
[3:58:45] im_capy: yes please
[3:58:54] Mister_Ript: @jkitchin75 You literally just agreed with me, then said no.  So...
[3:58:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[3:58:54] Mr_Junt: server first. then computer does and I never dug in again😩
[3:58:57] Crunks_Lever: Spine of Deathwing was TERRIBLE
[3:58:58] Nokterian: As we saw with every Classic expansion its always the latest patched version
[3:58:59] Mr_Junt: died
[3:59:07] Wcvechten: The meeting will be held on his back
[3:59:09] love_eggplant: we want war within, not cat
[3:59:10] im_capy: Its still ass to farm that dam thing
[3:59:24] jkitchin75: @Mister_Ript i was taking the piss
[3:59:27] im_capy: I love Firelands, my fav raid instance
[3:59:28] OhNoNotAgain: it would be the back breaker you say towelliee? it would be the backbone of the cata classic? god I need help someone stop me....
[3:59:28] Velarn435: "New Mythic Spine of Deathwing"
[3:59:41] Nokterian: Even solo for transmog runs Spine of Deathwing sucks
[3:59:46] Nirland1: amen!!! that fight blows and iv only done it solo now getting grefers in raid doing it ya na
[3:59:46] tlsmith3638: hasttag nochanges
[4:00:00] Crunks_Lever: Spine of Deathwing on Hardcore
[4:00:02] Wcvechten: Spine of Deathwing with extra spines!
[4:00:08] im_capy: hashtag more changes please
[4:00:09] macmittens808: they should redo madness of deathwing too, was very underwhelming end to a cool raid
[4:00:15] OhNoNotAgain: Have it incorporate mechanics from the Aberrus fight
[4:00:20] Wulfgrym: no changes and meaningful choices should be banned
[4:00:57] Wcvechten: nah, madness was dogshit
[4:01:00] Mister_Ript: I was able to solo heal Heroic Madness as a Resto Druid with the shroom bloom shit
[4:01:17] str4ysheep: so spine like the lfr version just a little harder
[4:01:36] DecayedmiNt: It was Kin raiders
[4:01:51] Mister_Ript: To be fair, though... you spend the whole Spine fight weakening Deathwing.  Madness is the result of him getting blasted out of the sky.  He's not at full strength and is making a last ditch effort
[4:01:58] im_capy: I wonder if they will launch the heroic dungeons the same way, but like as a "beta/alpha" thing instead
[4:02:22] TheItalianStallion321: i was just gonna ask that. i wonder if they are going to keep those beta/alpha/gamma dungeons
[4:02:26] TheItalianStallion321: or implement them earlier
[4:02:29] Mister_Ript: Bartender right next to you
[4:02:31] GooFTrooPCooP: vendor behind bar
[4:02:35] Nokterian: the leveling was good with the whole world revamp
[4:03:01] jkitchin75: so are thay doing mop?
[4:03:18] Wcvechten: I loved the ZG revamp personally, fun fights
[4:03:21] im_capy: @jkitchin75 why not, its easy money for them
[4:03:22] macmittens808: @Mister_Ript I just didn't like the our big bad villain was a gigantic dragon but the final boss was a couple tentacles LuL
[4:04:22] Wcvechten: I got kinda bored with cata real quick after hitting exalted and there was nothing to do apart from dungos or pvp
[4:04:22] im_capy: They at least give you a water mount asap

[4:04:25] iBanEvader: I loved the water zone lol

[4:04:53] Aerisot: Vasj had the best storyline imo,
[4:04:53] Wcvechten: Vashj'ir naga lore was neato tho
[4:05:17] im_capy: I didnt get that water mount from that zone until like 5 years after cata. I was so anti it
[4:05:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Riding around on a seahorse LIKE A BOSS
[4:05:22] Aerisot: I'm still waiting for the Battlemaiden to make her appearance though..
[4:05:23] Wcvechten: Yeah, I remember watching datamined Abyssal Maw raid layout videos
[4:05:27] Mister_Ript: Vashj'ir was an absolute pain in the ass
[4:05:44] Nokterian: i did the whole Vash'jir during my leveling
[4:05:54] im_capy: LUL
[4:05:58] MrGM: oh god no
[4:06:04] Nokterian: KEKW
[4:06:16] im_capy: SCreenshot it for me, and ill pretend I did it too
[4:06:33] Nokterian: He is saying Ah hell no
[4:06:34] el_duderino_70: yoyo, u married yet?
[4:06:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: did that zone only once, for loremaster
[4:06:37] Nokterian: LUL
[4:06:37] Nirland1: vasinjar ill do it i didnt mind that zone
[4:06:51] Runzudown: astatically nicely done zone though
[4:06:54] Odinslayer: 85 yea
[4:07:05] Aerisot: People are sleeping on Vashj'ir the only annoying part was the beginning with all the naga above you, once you are out of that area, you forget you are even in an underwater zone
[4:07:09] penandsword49: I actually like Vash'jir a lot one of my favorite zones.
[4:07:10] Wcvechten: cata - mop was 90
[4:07:18] jkitchin75: 90 -100
[4:07:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: cata and mop for 5 levels each
[4:07:26] Odinslayer: 85 cata 90 mop 100 wod 110 legion 120 bfa 60 shadowlands 70 dragonflight
[4:07:26] draxss: it was legion that broght back the 10 lvls\
[4:07:32] im_capy: We need to get a channel points reward to claim where he has to level in the water zone LUL
[4:08:02] im_capy: LUL
[4:08:04] Moobot: Add the game to your wishlist today by using this link! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/ I am going to die A LOT today =)
[4:08:04] Wcvechten: pog do it
[4:08:06] t_train_va: Marathon goal
[4:08:09] Shamwise: Onlytowell
[4:08:09] Shrandamar: haHAA
[4:08:13] macmittens808: big toe for bits confirmed
[4:08:24] OhNoNotAgain: Yeah, but what about that Big Toe 1/1 card eta?
[4:08:26] Narovoid: is it possible that the transmog stuff will be similar to retail with account wide collections and appearances?
[4:08:28] Odinslayer: deepholm was a great area
[4:08:37] Velarn435: "In the spirit of Classic, leveling has been altered to require questing through all zones, as intended by the developers..."
[4:09:00] 3dRes: I bet that your big toe looks very "Hobbit" like KEKW
[4:09:17] jkitchin75: wod classic but how it was ment to be
[4:09:18] Narovoid: Thank god cause i just got the vengeful glad greatsword an vanilla pvp rank 14 gear on pala hoping i can use it on my warrior
[4:09:18] Nokterian: Classic ended to Wotlk for me
[4:09:29] Aerisot: It is literally classic retail LUL the first gen of retail
[4:09:30] TheItalianStallion321: just wait til we get to Classic Legion
[4:09:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: just retail with a different talent tree
[4:09:32] el_duderino_70: rewatched The Big Lebowski yesterday. the Walter resemblance is uncanny
[4:09:32] TheItalianStallion321: KEKW
[4:09:58] love_eggplant: so we 'll get mop and then we are done right?
[4:10:12] love_eggplant: no way will there ever be draenor
[4:10:14] Aerisot: There 100% is a classic retail, Compared to todays retail, with the talent system, animations, ect
[4:10:19] im_capy: Classic era is the only classic because that world was removed, everything else is retail with a twist. Same engine
[4:10:22] TheItalianStallion321: @love_eggplant they're going all the way to Shadowlands baby
[4:10:27] love_eggplant: No
[4:10:30] el_duderino_70: dude i love that movie
[4:10:36] Nokterian: KEKW
[4:10:37] Odinslayer: we shouldn't have gotten cata in first place.. going more expansion after wotlk was a stupid idea tbh
[4:10:39] macmittens808: it wasn't long ago we were saying classic mop as a joke, now its not a joke anymore LuL
[4:10:58] Wcvechten: I'll admit it, I've never seen the big lebowski
[4:11:01] Molvonos: @Odinslayer towIgnit towIgnit towIgnit towIgnit
[4:11:03] Aerisot: Cata should have started WoW2
[4:11:10] TheItalianStallion321: @Odinslayer stupid for who? you? they see $$. thats all they care about. more subs, and less subs expiring
[4:11:15] im_capy: Classic is a money printer for Blizz
[4:11:24] Nokterian: We need more money LUL
[4:11:25] xdarkwombatx: @Towelliee whats your favorite classic xpac? Wrath? TBC?
[4:11:28] cipusanx: argus should have been an expansion
[4:11:39] macmittens808: wow 5 when
[4:11:45] Molvonos: I can never get enough Arthas dickriding.
[4:11:45] Odinslayer: i meant classic era they shouldn't have went past wotlk..
[4:12:07] Wcvechten: I mean it's shaping up to be imo
[4:12:13] im_capy: Ya, that was weird to add in at the end of BFA. Kinda felt like its own thing
[4:12:17] Wulfgrym: imagine someone at blizzard saying they shouldn't print free money with cata classic, pink slip on the desk before hes back at his desk
[4:12:17] TheItalianStallion321: @Odinslayer and all our statements are still directed towards you.
[4:12:18] Wcvechten: We just need void pirates
[4:12:21] TheItalianStallion321: they see $$
[4:12:23] iBanEvader: @Aerisot it's just a name man
[4:12:28] xdarkwombatx: Calling it: War Within = Classic, Midnight = TBC, Last Titan = Wrath
[4:12:40] iBanEvader: people are so focused on names, so weird
[4:12:48] Nokterian: I played the shit out of Legion and BfA
[4:12:53] shapebender: do you think they should redo their engine after seeing some of the stuff redone in unreal 3 or 4 rendering
[4:13:01] macmittens808: I really hope they pull the nzoth is still alive and tricked us into thinking we killed him
[4:13:01] Moobot: Opening some Marvel Moonknight! If you want some Hobby boxes you can find them at these online stores https://bit.ly/3NSTERE OR check here for your local Hobby shops https://bit.ly/48mudAp
[4:13:06] TheItalianStallion321: i, for 1, would love to replay Legion lol
[4:13:07] love_eggplant: @shapebender imo their graphic engine rn is pretty
[4:13:16] Molvonos: Yea, Ulduar, I feel, still has the best normal to heroic progress.
[4:13:22] xdarkwombatx: Twist? Old Gods are good?
[4:13:30] macmittens808: yeah thats what I mean
[4:13:30] Molvonos: If you can't do the triggers, you dont get hard content
[4:13:32] xdarkwombatx: Maybe Sargaras is good?
[4:13:41] xdarkwombatx: The Sword helps us?
[4:14:00] Aerisot: @iBanEvader disagree, they treated cata as an expansion, not a new game, they could have added a time skip, changed every zone, updated all the playable characters, not just Goblin and Worgan ect.
[4:14:01] TheItalianStallion321: remember Flex difficulty?
[4:14:01] Wcvechten: Wasn't it because in some cases you accidentally did hard mode when you didn't want to
[4:14:11] Shrandamar: Didnt they say the void takes over the sunwell in Midnight, I bet they turn the sunwell into a portal
[4:14:12] shapebender: @love_eggplant it is just seems "cleaner" in some of the people posting rendering of ironforge and such in unreal
[4:14:13] Odinslayer: @TheItalianStallion321 i know they want sub money but it still stupid and they saying they sent surveys saying people wanted cata is just more stupid, then how long they will go ? we gonna get to shadowlands classic then? lol its just ridiculous
[4:14:15] macmittens808: world first race and maybe hall of fame should be on a tournament realm, that way they won't need to nerf mythic 6 times
[4:14:56] TheItalianStallion321: @Odinslayer i totally get of what you are saying and not disagreeing with you but, they need $$. retail isnt enough anymore
[4:15:08] DecayedmiNt: And what did Paragon do? They started splits
[4:15:34] Aerisot: It would make sense, the Sunwell became the legions portal for Kil'jaeden during TBC
[4:15:38] TheItalianStallion321: @Odinslayer how far will they go? who knows....i THINK it depends on how classic cata goes
[4:16:29] Odinslayer: @TheItalianStallion321 they will come up and say they send surveys and people want mop xD
[4:16:30] im_capy: Or we go into it?
[4:16:34] Velarn435: Sunwell to rebirth the old gods...
[4:16:47] macmittens808: this sunwell is starting to sound like more trouble than its worth...
[4:17:07] Aerisot: Xal'atath learned her tricks from the legion, and is going to use them to her advantage

[4:17:32] Bigmace: sup bathroom accessory
[4:17:37] jarilrpg: why don't they just make a super hard "ultimate" version of the last boss, that only gives cosmetics, similar to FFXIV
[4:17:47] DecayedmiNt: They just support it with bugfixing
[4:17:53] valianya: I think our best bet for a Black Empire style expansion is that Void tentacle planet we saw in the Nighthold raid with that star augurer guy
[4:17:57] TheItalianStallion321: @jarilrpg no one would do that
[4:18:02] Wulfgrym: buff evoker
[4:18:08] Molvonos: @TheItalianStallion321 Nah, people would.
[4:18:28] Molvonos: Fuck, if the cosmetics were awesome enough and not some non-flying mount I cant even use in current content, i'd do it
[4:18:29] HaloS23: @Towelliee isnt that TWW?
[4:18:30] jarilrpg: @TheItalianStallion321 i mean to make it for the RWF people mostly
[4:18:51] Nokterian: Ghost of Tsushima finally coming to PC
[4:19:03] Wulfgrym: war within is asmon vs max LUL
[4:19:05] love_eggplant: its ognna be 3 patches of introduction? please no
[4:19:09] Wcvechten: He Knows PepeLaugh
[4:19:15] Maydie6066: @Molvonos I am so past Dragonriding mounts
[4:19:15] HaloS23: @Towelliee well TWW is introducing whats left pf the Black Empire
[4:19:25] Nokterian: We saw some void stuff on argus with Valeria Windrunner
[4:19:28] DecayedmiNt: Xal'atath coming back full strength maybe?
[4:19:29] Yumyumspectrum: is cat out?
[4:19:32] Wcvechten: Mu'ru is closest we got to it
[4:19:42] TheItalianStallion321: @jarilrpg well, now you are excluding cosmetics from most of the community so that would be bad
[4:19:44] valianya: Maybe the Void tentacle planet opens a portal, or rains Old God spores onto Azeroth trying to reinfect the planet.  To stop them we have to go to the Void planet and take them down, or empower the enslaved residents

[4:19:49] Crunks_Lever: yeah I want to know who the HMFIC is of the Void
[4:19:54] Molvonos: @Maydie6066 I prefer dragonflying mounts.  I'm talking about the KSM ground mounts.
[4:19:54] SamuraiWillZ916: or look like cardi B
[4:19:56] OhNoNotAgain: you let me have my VOID MOMMY
[4:20:01] TheItalianStallion321: @Molvonos if its completely separate from the raids. maybe?
[4:20:06] Aerisot: Xal'atath is literally walking around in a corpse
[4:20:24] TheItalianStallion321: yes, giving ground mounts for KSM now that we have dragonriding and flying, has been not smart IMO
[4:20:37] love_eggplant: its my corpse
[4:20:38] Aerisot: Ya we do
[4:20:41] Aerisot: Its Inaris
[4:20:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: she needs some sugar water
[4:20:55] Crunks_Lever: I mean, Sylvanas is a corpse......
[4:20:57] HaloS23: wait, NE? i thought she was a BE model
[4:21:09] Odinslayer: well technically shes a high elf
[4:21:19] Elijahss: @HaloS23 NE, if you are a NE you dont have to fight her
[4:21:26] HaloS23: @Odinslayer fair point
[4:21:46] Elijahss: She is Kaldori
[4:21:56] Aerisot: Xal'atath had us kill Inaris and place the body next to the blade, the blade absorbed the corpse, and Xal'atath walked out, she is even wearing the same armor :D
[4:22:01] TheItalianStallion321: @Towelliee do you think they will help out warriors towards lvl 60 phase?

[4:59:10] vellj12: @TheUnknowing <3 thank you for that. I havent tried any of the new features like HC, or SoD but i know cata is dropping in Aug. So wasnt sure..
[4:59:21] gudzzo: Rider of the Apocalypse Hero Talents when

[5:01:36] SS_Nynaeve: sure it was a good expansion only reason it gets hate is dragonsoul
[5:01:58] the_general01: @TheEyeVII lo
[5:02:05] Molvonos: I kinda stopped playing WoW for Cata.  Wasn't a fan of a few things that happened that expac, came back for WoD, lol
[5:02:07] zurendal: also excited cause its when i started. when i first played deathwing would randomly kill me while lvling in zones. was the coolest thing ever
[5:02:21] zelours: I really don't think they should of called it classic though
[5:02:27] TheEyeVII: i'm sure some dozens can't wait for the 1st retail classic, i for one can't wait to ignore it TwitchConHYPE
[5:03:27] allisonkielle: I mean that first raid set was fucking glorious
[5:03:49] SS_Nynaeve: lets be real too its almost 100% certain now that we get cata that we also get mop

[5:13:29] gudzzo: brewmaster xD
[5:13:40] devildriver1919: most are passives tho
[5:13:40] pbnj_kills: have you seen the amount of buttons on shaman in retail?
[5:14:14] SS_Nynaeve: they rly need to heavily prune abilities again
[5:14:58] starknadooo: brews got like 15 buttons in their normal rotation. Its insane
[5:16:06] cipusanx: I dont think its ok to have a button that does 3 different things. that i would call bloat
[5:16:07] im_capy: Ya I was thinking about bloat big time
[5:16:10] TheUnknowing: hero talents should just be passives
[5:16:12] Krait06: yep same
[5:16:16] JoshuaTree6969: corsair scimitar exists
[5:16:26] macmittens808: the ones that get me are when people say a spec is bloated when they're new and don't understand their buttons
[5:16:30] Molvonos: I just roll my face across my keyboard when I play brew.
[5:16:37] GodTheMechanic: That craft cast time is something else
[5:16:40] SamuraiWillZ916: the investment in buttons need to make the the abilities better
[5:16:42] Dudutoolbox: just dont use weak auras

[5:17:07] im_capy: just be a bad player LUL
[5:17:13] SamuraiWillZ916: ive always felt like ww monks need to be top dps because of how many buttons they need to hit
[5:17:18] JoshuaTree6969: get gud
[5:17:30] TheEyeVII: the max "clusterfuck" for buttons was reached in MoP? & never got that bad again imo, DF talent trees are great, i'm waiting for alpha at least to judge hero talents samiMonka_HF
[5:17:35] Molvonos: This is why I play Aug.  So people cant accuse me of being skilled.
[5:17:57] macmittens808: @Molvonos KEKW
[5:18:33] tlsmith3638: i was dead set agaianst WA a while back i did break downa d start using some after a while
[5:18:42] zorantt: Didn't Blizz say something about wanting less WA? Or am I misremembering?
[5:18:54] JoshuaTree6969: i hate elvUI but WA is a must
[5:19:12] tlsmith3638: that would be a dream come true
[5:19:16] TheEyeVII: it wouldn't be mythic tho it would be classic pve payoGa
[5:19:32] im_capy: Pandoras box was opened, dont think getting rid of WA is  possible
[5:20:22] Molvonos: You know that in a few years, your weak auras and UI elements are gonna look like an Internet Explorer window back in the early 90s.  https://imgur.com/a/H8Y0kQ3 @Towelliee
[5:20:25] gudzzo: i dont have Weakauras but im only doing 20 Keys for Portal and some Hc Raid Bosses though thats still fun for me ( with friends )
[5:20:40] Nirland1: but on the flip side the WA and comunity are now able to make alittle bit of change for these

[5:23:01] uyouu: @3dRes bonzi buddy
[5:23:24] macmittens808: if they want to cut back on WA they need to make buffs/debuffs easier to parse maybe star some to bring them to a separate prio window
[5:23:33] meozart: @towelliee the new fallout trailer dropped
[5:23:45] smashwow: sark and no WAs? eeeehhhhh

[5:24:06] Dudutoolbox: i wonder if Ion uses WA

[6:02:12] LoneRangers: I easily have the most hours in cata. Was my favorite expansion.
[6:02:17] Eurrekka: What's the uprez vs normal graphics difference?
[6:02:23] MysticalOS: i'd be surprised if bag combiner was in cata
[6:02:28] wraaith: only got 1 bag its combined
[6:02:29] Bareno: that was introduced in DF, probably not in this client
[6:02:53] Mitune: graphics comparison?

[6:06:32] Wcvechten: 4.3 was the final patch ye, so dragon soul tuning
[6:06:32] mozavich: "bro in classic, you would have died already. it was so hard"
[6:06:34] MysticalOS: cata is severely underrated by players who only remember dragonsoul, and not how good cata was at start. i hope we get those sweet pre nerf dungeons
[6:06:37] SamuraiWillZ916: how do change the game version to in development?
[6:06:38] Pr1m0x21: cata enjoyers reunite

[6:07:00] wraaith: do we get in touch with panda again ?
[6:07:04] Thoreya: towelliee only person who got beta sadge
[6:07:06] MysticalOS: @Towelliee VERY few got access, they didn't even invite first wave of friends and family yet. just top creators, with majority of those not even caring about cata
[6:07:07] LuiBMHunter: Your own personal server :)
[6:07:09] TSGJamesR: Pre-nerf dungeons? Doubt it, @MysticalOS but that'd be nice. But then come Firelands raid, the nerf will be worse. KEKW
[6:07:09] jkitchin75: ask panda
[6:07:09] Pr1m0x21: dead in beta
[6:07:10] Dudutoolbox: does anyone even  know that the beta  is  out?
[6:07:21] CrunkyBrewster: I didnt get it sadly Sadge
[6:07:28] Buckwink: you mean Chinglish?
[6:07:32] TSGJamesR: Yeah, 4.2 back then saw Heroic dungeons nerfed to the ground worse that paladins.
[6:07:34] CrunkyBrewster: Beta is out now
[6:07:36] mozavich: towelliee has super streamer privilege/access
[6:07:46] TSGJamesR: Didn't get in this wave, but we'll see.
[6:07:50] jasonbriggs: @Towelliee think your the only one who signed up for it kekw
[6:07:52] CrunkyBrewster: I believe people know because its on wowhead and reddit
[6:07:52] Wcvechten: some  more  than others
[6:07:52] Krait06: gnomes got their own area too no?
[6:08:05] TSGJamesR: @Krait06 Correct
[6:08:07] jaseff693: what server is hammer squad on for classic wrath
[6:08:12] Thills_: I just remember your paladin from cata and your pvp video
[6:08:14] Wcvechten: ship it
[6:08:21] CrunkyBrewster: Gnomes initially didnt get it their own area til I think WoD if im not mistaken
[6:08:27] macmittens808: well there was that interface error on login
[6:08:29] im_capy: In your OG Cata video, you say "im a clicker" LUL
[6:08:29] TSGJamesR: Cata gave gnomes and trolls their own starting experiences, which was a TLDR of some limited time events that took places in pre-Cata.
[6:08:34] force_FMD: i just see invaders no bugs
[6:08:35] mozavich: No Beta Invite Club, pst to join
[6:08:38] Maydie6066: No email for beta access, why do i even wake up in the morning anymore Kappa
[6:08:45] LuiBMHunter: either didn't realise or never played tauren back then - did anyone else have the starting zone changed?
[6:08:46] Dudutoolbox: gnomes had their area in cata
[6:08:52] TSGJamesR: Yep, 2010 Towelliee was a Clicker. KEKW
[6:08:57] Plague_GG: yea
[6:08:58] Ilibrit: I remember cata levelling with zygor
[6:08:58] flebbooo: yeep
[6:09:03] CrunkyBrewster: oh wait do you have to be subbed to get a beta invite? im not subbed right now
[6:09:10] Thills_: yes even the skill trees got reduced
[6:09:11] Dudutoolbox: @Towelliee show us exorcism
[6:09:18] Shrandamar: Retail-
[6:09:19] MysticalOS: they simplified spell ranks to just 1, and truncated talent trees
[6:09:22] lazerous113: Is cata beta only for the selct few or is it accessible for everyone
[6:09:26] shocky_324: wasnt that when they made you get the last talent before going into a new tree?
[6:09:28] TSGJamesR: I remember TB's Worgen videos, along with seeing the Prot Paladin changes Towelliee mentioned.
[6:09:28] expbottles: do beta characters carry over to launch?
[6:09:29] MysticalOS: but still have glorious reforging
[6:09:31] macmittens808: Pepehand this is when classic died

[6:14:28] Thills_: @TheItalianStallion321 its ok poor king I feel that as well peepoSad
[6:14:30] mozavich: @TSGJamesR pretty sure that's a talent, no?
[6:14:32] Snabido: World Order streams when?

[6:14:42] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @TSGJamesR (warning)
[6:14:50] talmadimtv: question, why beta test something that was beta tested back in the day?
[6:14:50] Nokterian: All starting zones and leveling zones have changed so yeah it needs testing
[6:15:01] FatTown: this is how seals should be, 30min duration kek
[6:15:04] Thills_: I cant wait to play uh/ret 2s gonna be a blast
[6:15:10] im_capy: @TheItalianStallion321 ya, it aint worth. We would have a better chance making our own group tbh, or swipe that CC LUL
[6:15:10] Maydie6066: LFG WC Boost!!!
[6:15:11] TSGJamesR: @mozavich You might be right.
[6:15:29] Thills_: ya but the quest chain in cata for each zone is pretty quick
[6:15:31] LuiBMHunter: mebbe you should have made a dk instead :)
[6:15:31] dominikoff: O. Cata prot specs(war/pala) got Vengence! They were fckn OP on leveling.
[6:15:33] TSGJamesR: Like, 80 and then to 85.
[6:15:38] mozavich: @TSGJamesR my memory is shit these days lol
[6:15:41] TheItalianStallion321: @Thills_ @im_capy insane lol i guess ill grind dungeons
[6:15:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Starting out with crusader strike is nice, I'm working on a Wrath ret paladin and it's still autoattack simulator in it
[6:15:46] Thoreya: @talmadimtv because theres theyre reviving an older version of the game
[6:15:52] Thoreya: that doesnt exist
[6:16:02] FatTown: was Cata the expansion where they normallized all caster mana?
[6:16:06] FatTown: or was that in mop
[6:16:07] TSGJamesR: Man, I remember paladin block-capping was a thing in Cata.
[6:16:17] dominikoff: mana regen is big enogh off combat
[6:16:17] Thills_: @FatTown no that was mop I think
[6:16:26] TSGJamesR: It was in 4.3.
[6:16:33] TSGJamesR: You had to stack Mastery for that.
[6:16:38] im_capy: @TheItalianStallion321 if you can get into a guild, I know a few are looking. Really comes down to class though I tihnk, most need range I feel
[6:16:39] Plague_GG: it was
[6:16:41] FatTown: ah word, i quit during cata and came back during mop originally for WoD kek
[6:16:41] Hrurcf: Cata is going to be so fun to play again
[6:16:44] talmadimtv: @Thoreya  oh i get it i just think its dumb as hell
[6:16:45] Thills_: just reforge into all mastery
[6:16:47] wraaith: u cant do it in classic wrath right ?
[6:17:08] dominikoff: 10-ish i think
[6:17:11] zeitgeiz: I just need to get motivated to finish leveling to 80 so I can play when this comes out

[6:17:54] TheItalianStallion321: DEJA VU
[6:17:55] FatTown: Cata should just be everyone has to restart
[6:17:59] FatTown: that would be awesome
[6:18:00] TSGJamesR: Not sure which expansion made it to where Crit = Parry for Prot, if it was Cata or MOP or not.
[6:18:03] xxtankerbellx: INQUA BOOM

[6:43:33] iBanEvader: aaah
[6:43:50] Alaquane: @HaxzorJimDuggan was that in Brill or Silverpine?
[6:43:51] Thills_: @FatTown wrath classic gets forced updated to cata on launch so yes everything goes to cata
[6:43:51] Rohac123: i mean some of them still play mostly vanilla LUL

[6:44:53] im_capy: @ambiotic have you seen some of the Arthas Ai generated videos, not the same, but it gives me hope
[6:45:04] instant_savage: so what happens to retail when clssic catches up there just gonna be retail servers

[7:31:18] Thills_: oooh I rememeber that
[7:31:23] Thills_: a lot of people died KEKW
[7:31:23] vurax1: @Masacru001 wym cata was amazing. What was so horrible about it? Theres def more positives than Negatives.
[7:31:26] VarlBGem: I did that once too
[7:31:32] Gitmm: def leveling 1-85 just to reclear firelands again
[7:31:42] zorantt: One thing I am curious about: 10.2.6 is slated for March. We know that the season will be on the PTR but with no word on what the event is right now, does that mean 10.2.6 season will be on PTR for 1 week? And it would be dropping March 26th?
[7:31:46] Eurrekka: If you had a hunated momento in ur bags and u flew over the scar then it would just 360 fly  in spot and u were stuck back in the day
[7:32:03] Naowh: lvl 8 lol noob

[7:33:30] schlick92: Did toweliee quit vaping?
[7:33:31] Niksen_99: That spell made ret pala so op
[7:33:37] zorantt: "That means there will be no PTR (Public Test Realm) for a portion of the next content update as we have traditionally done. What we can say is that it will be coming in March. A finer point, but the update will also include everything that’s needed for Dragonflight Season 4 but will be hidden. Around (after) the launch of the update we will make Season 4 available for testing on a 10.2.6 PTR before it goes live." So I misunderstood. It's season 4 that would be on the PTR
[7:33:39] the_general01: @vurax1 i mean, cata ruined the game for me. i hated nearly all of the systems
[7:33:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: word of glory is pretty sweet

[8:42:51] immortalllz: well its gear not talents
[8:43:02] suunascasa: I remember playing pvp as a blood dk in cata, was fun af and op
[8:43:02] immortalllz: very low crit/mastery to begin
[8:43:12] Hotner: ye tanks were crazy in MoP, but you wont see them top the meters in cata
[8:43:20] immortalllz: esp mastery for arms
[8:43:36] Genilort: wont they add the last patch?
[8:43:38] VarlBGem: All in the name of "balance" no doubt
[8:43:43] zuugas: @kimdah_ remember to gather a specific type of gear with a lot of expertise which you use before using your demon form and swap back to normal gear before the pull during cata.
[8:43:51] Genilort: pvp was good
[8:43:56] z3rodown: People hated pandas so much
[8:44:01] Nokterian: Also MoP introduced the not so great talent tree
[8:44:04] JoshuaTree6969: lotta people were very OUT on MoP
[8:44:05] Bixster: players were just malding over Pandas and not playing it because of it
[8:44:06] Wcvechten: Pandaria had people mostly bitching about Pandas, and the ungodly amount of dailies
[8:44:12] JoshuaTree6969: too kung fu panda-ish
[8:44:17] immortalllz: maybe reforge if from start will help
[8:44:17] nikodemuscrowley: i still hate pandas
[8:44:22] SingleSheriff: @Hotner well they should be tbh. Nowadays they are just mix of self healing and more of a damage
[8:44:25] Macrodotz: Timeless isles wer great
[8:44:25] immortalllz: that was introduced later in cata if i remember
[8:44:33] Kimdah_: @zuugas I know
[8:44:39] SingleSheriff: and they just press a little bit of defensive now and then
[8:44:41] jaina8675309: i played 30 stright hrs when it came out
[8:44:42] Buckwink: mop would be remembered more if not for the pandas
[8:44:42] mozavich: people have revision history when looking at MoP. They hated it because Kung Fu Panda... then later on they talked about how great of an expansion it was. Lol
[8:44:51] Ghoost172: Pandaria was the xpac i had the most fun with friends and my guild
[8:45:02] Kimdah_: @mozavich I had a blast during MoP
[8:45:07] Onisekai: MoP was such a good expac
[8:45:10] SingleSheriff: try to miss any of your defensive rotations in cata and you will be punished severely by bosses
[8:45:18] mozavich: @Kimdah_ me too
[8:45:29] Kimdah_: Athene.. Man.. Towel, you make me feel old..
[8:45:30] Calaum: pandas were in WC3 lol anyone who argues MOP wasnt a true WC fan
[8:45:39] slamdunkshaq: ATHENE xD that guy
[8:45:39] JoshuaTree6969: no that doesnt happen today...
[8:45:46] immortalllz: mop prob best overall all tiers during exp

[8:45:59] ctg_dreamz: ToT and SoO back to back might be the best
[8:46:01] Krampton15: I loved siege of org
[8:46:01] Bixster: way to much trash in ToT for my taste
[8:46:11] devilhawk83: we all knows Ulduar is the best raid of all time
[8:46:27] Macrodotz: Timeless isles grind and pvp  was so fun
[8:46:29] CAD604: LUL
