[2:01:09] BingoTingler: surely it's good for beans big bad boy heart
[2:01:12] Relax94: adderall isn't an opiate
[2:01:15] Barry74: theres strains of it
[2:01:16] JabbaTheChinchilla: its literally a leaf KEKG
[2:01:18] Barry74: downer and uppers
[2:01:20] subjugatesxo: Drugs are bad mmmmkay
[2:01:21] NotASkiller: Fuzion would rather be snorting kratom than something productive (retail 2s). if that's not addiction I don't know what is
[2:01:21] kirk_hunts: Adderall is amphetamine salts and it's dope as fuck
[2:01:22] GunjiTV: yes
[2:01:23] Barry74: white strain was my fav
[2:01:24] mcboonee: amphetamine lol

[2:01:36] echoloch: depends how your body metabolizes it
[2:01:41] indithedog: amphetamines like adderall and meth are stimulants
[2:01:45] 2Smug: Kermit: ‚ÄúKratom‚Äù commonly refers to an herbal substance that can produce opioid- and stimulant-like effects. Kratom and kratom-based products are currently legal and accessible in many areas, though U.S. and international agencies continue to review emerging evidence to inform kratom policy.
[2:01:50] myhunter: ICANT
[2:01:51] pavelcatsyuk: the first link when you google it is National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
[2:01:54] NotASkiller: @2smug that's a skip.
[2:01:55] BingoTingler: adderall works differently in different people; people with ADHD it calms them down - People that don't need Adderall are made more hyper - You lose your appetite
[2:01:57] mybootyisasnack: you gotta chop it up and snort the powder with your ass                     wetard

[2:03:10] Nathanew321: KRATOM HYPE LETSGO
[2:03:11] bakedbeansandbread: go cap
[2:03:13] 2Smug: Kermit: Kratom produces opioid- and stimulant-like effects. People who use kratom report both stimulant-like effects (increased energy, alertness and rapid heart rate) and effects that are similar to opioids and sedatives (relaxation, pain relief and confusion).

[3:16:00] MainlyHigh: Adam: This was probably the most bottom of the barrel GTA Online "RP" I've seen on 4.0 so far. Absolutely no "yes, and", zero breadcrumbs to continue the RP scenario. Ocean dumping should really be the absolute last resort in a story arc. This scam group seems to be all about pocket and house wiping with no consequences. What's the point, RP wise?

[3:18:30] MainlyHigh: Adam: cam squad has also been going around trying to rob people for keys and houses. In this instance, since they got a lick I think they decided to ocean dump everyone to remove traces of their actions.  As of the latest update, I believe one of the victims fell out of the car and was never ocean dumped, so they might actually remember.
