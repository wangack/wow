[1:48:39] ijuki: @morp1onz For the flex Kappa
[1:48:43] JBonezey: 4090 is overkill, having a 5800 3XD is way more important
[1:48:53] llNoTToXiCll: @morp1onz  really overkill
[1:48:54] GamingDad77: But does it play Minecraft?

[1:49:18] pereadin: @NoTToXiCLuL oh it doesn't look like they have a visual effect but enchanting does offer new visual effects to learn separate from the proper weapon enchants

[1:50:54] Dreadfrost: for red go bloodshot
[1:51:08] Bl4ckSauce: @ijuki oh i see
[1:51:20] JBonezey: With BDK being this strong out the gate, they are going to scale out of control again.
[1:52:06] Dreadfrost: they will be unkillable, but not that hot on dmg
[1:52:25] JBonezey: Macro that boss from ICC soundbyte everytime you use Bonestorm
[1:52:26] Dreadfrost: cone blind

[2:19:30] SivertSchultz: They are nerfing that trinket right

[2:20:38] Crowald: Professions do look good, I will agree with that.
[2:20:54] SimonPapeArt: @GaterGator yeah, that's why blizz finally cut taht stuff out for DF
[2:20:58] haiil: @haiil ahh that is awesome!
[2:21:04] JBonezey: Return of the Cata/MoP WoW gameplay!
[2:21:10] denflup: people might be bored after a month
[2:21:20] Dreadfrost: vamp blood
[2:21:23] Baaltaza: @ptahm0se Cut MoP out of it. LUL
[2:21:24] JBonezey: The less systems Blizzard makes, the less chance they have to fuck something up.
[2:21:25] Architank: LUL
[2:21:27] w1ns1ow: NotLikeThis
[2:21:28] EmpathyLiveChat: What are the callings like?
[2:21:45] icerasta: @Aruar89 People get bored after a month of every patch
[2:21:45] Crowald: I realize this is a hot take, but I think the game needs more solo content.
[2:21:57] JBonezey: MoP was a great xpac that a lot of people love.
[2:22:08] vulkankragon: why do i feel like dragonflight will end up like cata 2.0
[2:22:30] JBonezey: Cata was great too, only problem with Cata really was Massive patch gaps
[2:22:36] altair19992: MoP dmg YEP
[2:22:43] Baaltaza: @ptahm0se That's not what i meant. I love MoP.
[2:22:54] EmpathyLiveChat: @ptahm0se it also ruined the world and the cinematic was awful
[2:22:55] Crowald: WoD would have been good if they got ALL the content out that they wanted to make
[2:23:13] w1ns1ow: How is this like mop?
[2:23:18] mozavich: @dwolters_the_zombieman https://clips.twitch.tv/VivaciousBlithePicklesOhMyDog-SupUT7IVdyjMDknn
[2:23:37] Stixxerz: well so basicly u telling me this is the right expac for me to return
[2:23:38] JBonezey: It didn't ruin the world, it just left it in a state that should have been continually updated. Story of Cata was fine up to the last boss.
[2:23:44] inda262: cant get more boring then running around the maw and doing torghast
[2:23:46] norunkai1989: boring means more time for alts i guess
[2:23:52] xRykku: MMOs have shifted to be a more casual thing now. People dont want it to feel like a second job.
[2:24:05] SimonPapeArt: 9.0 maw grind was the worst for surre
[2:24:32] TheEndIsNear777: shadowlands classic when :P
[2:24:33] Baaltaza: @xRykku And that's a good thing imo
[2:24:35] mith124: what was the 9.0 grind again
[2:24:45] TheEndIsNear777: :p *
[2:25:05] xd_pad: account wide dragonriding solves that early grind
[2:25:09] kalamari__: yes, one grindable bpower would be nice. not more
[2:25:11] huk42: sounds like "we'll never have 8.0 islands grind"  :)
[2:25:13] JBonezey: Its a very obvious routine that Blizz makes. Doesn't put out enough content on launch, so they put in a ton of grind. Take 8-10 months to release .1 losing 65% of their player base.
[2:25:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Korthia....eh

[2:25:22] darthhelmett: no borrowed power please :( rather play alts man
[2:25:22] ClarkKen: I feel like playing alt is better then doing grind
[2:25:33] Dreadfrost: dayum them stats :D blood dk pwning healing
[2:25:34] NiteshadezTV: poor Frost DKs
[2:25:34] ClarkKen: exactly
[2:25:36] looney199725: whats ur build
[2:25:37] AlphasaurusRexx: lol frost dk
[2:25:40] GunkaBeast: artifact power will be back as dragon power
[2:25:40] GTmask: LUL
[2:25:44] looney199725: ah okay
[2:25:47] looney199725: trinket carry
[2:25:47] Crowald: LMAOOO WHAT
[2:25:51] Admiller0: KEKW
[2:26:01] Baaltaza: What the fuck KEKW
[2:26:04] KyleEverett: Blood damage needs a bit of a buff haha
[2:26:09] mofongorelleno: There’s your borrowed power
[2:26:09] Wadjaah: Here's your borrowed power OpieOP
[2:26:17] altair19992: this is why raid trinkets are never fun and op KEKW
[2:26:21] Drackle: 22k healing
[2:26:22] Alienfromger: balanced KEKW
[2:26:30] Aidler: I’m more skeptical but let’s see where DF stands in 6 months. if most people obviously agree that Legion was the best expansion the direction they took with DF is at least strange
[2:26:37] KyleEverett: Storm Eater's Boon is gonna get a an aoe soft cap I hope.
[2:26:53] altair19992: YEP " see you next expac"
[2:27:05] KyleEverett: did you press Decoration on CD?
[2:27:07] kalamari__: lux is going hard for halloween LUL https://imgur.com/a/qMIuWAr
[2:27:09] EmpathyLiveChat: @ptahm0se I agree that zones would feel more alive if they were continually updated
[2:27:16] MortiousPrime: Yeah, if it's a game I can pop in every once in a while and enjoy myself? I would stay subbed
[2:27:16] haiil: Is Frost DK just always trash at expansion beginnings? :P
[2:27:17] blooodraine: mAW Grind gone but proffesions gonna be a grind to right @Towelliee
[2:27:20] MortiousPrime: $15/month is nothing
[2:27:21] daththo_: after 3 years m+ in blizzard :D i experienced dep  key for +2 :D
[2:27:28] tylawd: chat what is this 'borrowed power' I keep hearing.
[2:27:30] PigPenLen: @kalamari__ LUL LUL
[2:27:30] kaihole: The mythic vault was the best feature added for casuals
[2:27:31] Architank: People don't mind paying money as long as they having fun.
[2:27:33] Artemisthemp: Don't rush
[2:27:33] JBonezey: Legion content release schedule please
[2:27:39] koko316: That will be me playing casual
[2:27:43] AlphasaurusRexx: @haiil yeah. it needs a lot of haste to be decent
[2:27:51] The_Dane_Train: Im worried that they are missing what the casuals want. I think an engaging leveling experience is critical. As a casual I don’t want to ‘play the patch’. I want to play the whole game.
[2:27:52] mabo4tv: 2 more weeks till Dracthyr is playable, right?
[2:28:07] JBonezey: 15 bucks is slightly more than a single Chipotle visit
[2:28:18] DoughBoi_Trev: @tylawd wowhead has answers and googles
[2:28:20] SimonPapeArt: I dont' see the problem with cutting down on all the grind and system. jsut frees up more dev time and recources to developo more raids/inis/patches and the "bordedom" problems solves itself
[2:28:23] FusionKissMe: @Amiuzman 8 more days I think
[2:28:27] daththo_: @Amiuzman 20 day before relese
[2:28:39] Alienfromger: 5% forgot they have a sub EZ
[2:28:40] mabo4tv: I thought as well but Roadmap shows 2weeks
[2:28:43] haiil: @haiil I guess :/ Just sad, absolute favorite class and spec
[2:28:43] Moobot:  Please visit towelliee.com to get caught up on all of the latest Youtube videos,Special Events, Sponsor information and Discord invites that may be coming up in the stream!
[2:28:47] JBonezey: It's like you knew or something...
[2:28:51] EmpathyLiveChat: Yeah, I don't like Renown. To me it's just gated levelling.
[2:29:03] ineqsho: Evoker starts from lvl 10?
[2:29:04] r0b928: It’s like he knew
[2:29:05] Dreadfrost: @Towelliee check healing
[2:29:06] Crowald: Set up ur PC to autoupdate WoW so it's ready when u get home :D
[2:29:09] awesum_rosum: are you doing another key?
[2:29:11] vulkankragon: why lfr is there isn't it? for casuals to experience content
[2:29:12] JBonezey: Evoker starts level 58
[2:29:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: if Evoker had a tank spec I would play it, but since it doesn't I'm just not interested in them
[2:29:28] Aidler: I basically want something to do every day that’s not M+, raiding or PVP and skeptical if professions can be that thing
[2:29:28] ZeroNpcTV: @haiil dk trash? im pretty ok with my frost dk
[2:29:30] 91Niki: @GaterGator Can we not, thank you
[2:29:31] Architank: Towelliee is an insider yep
[2:29:35] inda262: worst part of renown was having to do maw dailys at the start
[2:29:37] JBonezey: LFR is a bane on the game and should be removed and or combined with Normal.
[2:29:38] AlphasaurusRexx: @haiil that guy could have just misused his CDs
[2:29:39] KyleEverett: It's not optional for crafters. :D
[2:29:43] r0b928: Does origin have RTS laptops?
[2:29:46] Arore_1599: and Renown in DF.. you can farm them all at the same time
[2:29:47] EmpathyLiveChat: Ah I see
[2:29:49] daththo_: everything give renown point :D it's easy to lvl
[2:29:49] KyleEverett: @ptahm0se Wrong
[2:29:54] Arore_1599: no stupid covenant switcheroo
[2:29:54] atsq1: What should I be working on for dragon flight? I’m working on getting shadowlands flying and alts
[2:29:55] Brumbs: @towelliee will the renown help end game stuff at all, in anyway?
[2:29:58] AlphasaurusRexx: @haiil using cds at the wrong time dumpsters your dps
[2:30:07] The_Dane_Train: I just think with the whole ‘play the patch’ mentality it’s impossible to keep the average player playing. And anything besides ‘play the patch’ is left for dead.
[2:30:11] haiil: @haiil True
[2:30:17] Brumbs: Oh turn up
[2:30:18] JBonezey: FFXIV you can queue  up for Normal Raids and people do them just fine. Raise the floor of this community
[2:30:25] xRykku: @Brumbs Think most of it is cosmetics, mounts, tmogs et
[2:30:38] Brumbs: @xrykku that’s what I like to hear
[2:30:39] valrash1981: Everquest is the way
[2:30:41] Stiffy84: Towelliee i got some Basil Hayden... damn its good and i needed after that Steelers. game! lol
[2:30:43] Riuujin_: new renown is basicly reputation
[2:30:46] haiil: i absolutely love the renown is down to cosmetics, achievement stuff
[2:30:56] vulkankragon: @The_Dane_Train 100% agree
[2:30:57] JohntheBarbarian: recipes for consumes behind rep? @towelliee
[2:31:00] JBonezey: Love the renown reuse on Factions
[2:31:03] Alaquane: @r0b928 it's just one model laptop, but it does say ready to ship
[2:31:09] Aidler: LFR is the only raiding I ever did. loosing it would be bad
[2:31:13] 91Niki: I just really hope DF won't have the same overly complicated systems when it comes to getting mounts, tmog and so on from the DF covenants. I am really not a huge fan of the systems they used for getting the mounts, pets and such from covenant vendors
[2:31:20] JBonezey: Professions are a pretty big grind, and that's okay.
[2:31:26] flebbooo: catch up
[2:31:27] denflup: didnt play alts
[2:31:27] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee do you know of any businesses that does custom designs for side panels?
[2:31:27] xd_pad: Crafting will be a long grind, but you can make some cash or gear up alts along the way. It seems like it will be rewarding to min/maxers and alt levelers alike
[2:31:29] unholyagony: im 100% playing an alt.
[2:31:30] Arore_1599: alts = MASSRIVE GRIND
[2:31:31] EmpathyLiveChat: Yes
[2:31:31] khaballl: renown+legos+ZM rep
[2:31:33] jwt55: Wow
[2:31:38] Shamwise: Truth
[2:31:38] vulkankragon: @Aidler it negatively affects the game
[2:31:39] JBonezey: It was work I didn't want to play bc Covenants were garbage and the story was garbage.
[2:31:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, making all that crazy gear for alts was stupid expensive
[2:31:45] Xanothis: @Towelliee that is the #1 reason I couldn't alt man
[2:31:46] Artemisthemp: So like TBC
[2:31:52] valrash1981: There content is a sleep fest, to tmeplated it's lost all touch with its bases at this point.
[2:32:00] tyler2tall89: Like the good ole days
[2:32:01] Zirist: No I cant play my class because I dont have bis leggo
[2:32:06] xXBuck: That is the way alts should be!
[2:32:06] Aidler: @vulkankragon how?
[2:32:07] Artemisthemp: Cata = You don't play
[2:32:07] GunkaBeast: the big bad in DF will be artifact power
[2:32:08] flebbooo: Pog
[2:32:10] Wadjaah: Is the rep think with the centaurs etc account wide ?
[2:32:10] Quikbeard: Thank fucking Christ.
[2:32:11] MR_WYTE: Account-wide progression is da wae!
[2:32:13] Wadjaah: thing*
[2:32:15] Architank: If I want to raid with my current guild I have to an alt
[2:32:22] JBonezey: LFR shouldn't drop gear, you are there to "see the story"
[2:32:22] blooodraine: @Towelliee  week free from work with DF release flexxx
[2:32:26] vulkankragon: @Aidler inflates ilvl
[2:32:35] Artemisthemp: Wasn't that Pre-patch?
[2:32:38] HairyAreolaus: Does PvP still have the terrible honor leveling system?
[2:32:47] AintEvenFlexin: arent primal storms worthless with the low ilvl
[2:33:02] SteLawBro: Thats not the WoW player though. Now people will log in, sit in town and say "i have nothing to do". Done playing.
[2:33:17] SteLawBro: We know how sitting in garrisons worked.
[2:33:17] valrash1981: And anything that is too much fun gets neutered.
[2:33:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Farming storms all day on alts actually sounds good to me, instead of having to do all kinds of other things
[2:33:26] GamingDad77: @SteLawBro they have always done that
[2:33:31] KyleEverett: @HairyAreolaus honor levels are still a thing but they're purely cosmetic stuff
[2:33:37] Aidler: @vulkankragon what does that even mean? how can a artificial stat like ilvl that has no upper limit get inflated?
[2:33:49] Stiffy84: prepatch storms on the 15th also?
[2:33:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like with the Threads of Fate for alts, I liked that better than going back through the questlines
[2:33:51] 91Niki: Yeah, not having 90 different mechanics and quests that alts need to catch up with to be viable for dungeons and raids is really nice
[2:33:52] Ardentfoxx0017: Do crafters craft catch up gear as well? Like in WoD?
[2:33:57] SteLawBro: @GamingDad77 Not when there is always dailys and systems to grind.
[2:33:59] The_Dane_Train: @stelawbro agree. Sure lots of people want to dungeon/raid with a new alt. But to me it’s the same 8 dungeons with slightly different buttons to push.
[2:34:14] MoodyVanessa: @Aidler they are just looking for excuses to want LFR removed at that point lol

[2:34:30] valrash1981: Beta or did the xpac drop haven't payed attention to it at all?
[2:34:45] ZeroNpcTV: beta
[2:34:52] The_Dane_Train: I wish they didn’t raise the level cap, and made the 1-60 experience more engaging.
[2:34:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having options is good
[2:34:57] riffraff005: he's in beta right now
[2:34:59] Aidler: @wildallie agree
[2:35:12] GamingDad77: @SteLawBro The players that dont want to do dailies. still compain
[2:35:20] AnotherCheche: whats the mount look like
[2:35:20] 91Niki: Oh nice, it's just a flat currency, not two different ones like in SL
[2:35:20] phinoxrgp: nice
[2:36:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1 sigil per storm type per week was how it was

[2:36:07] Brumbs: Are the sigils BOA?
[2:36:14] 91Niki: I can only assume that cap will be lightened once we get further into the exp @Towelliee
[2:36:19] SimonPapeArt: wasnt it like one every 3 days/every storm cycle?
[2:36:43] PatchMyEye: yea it's def more than 1 per week
[2:36:48] borgking82: @Towelliee how is warr tanking so far ?
[2:37:10] darthhelmett: @Towelliee is valor uncapped?
[2:37:19] CardinalTX: but but but Towelliee if someone gets gear in LFR it ruins the game for me! Kappa
[2:37:23] itsDets: it's one per week
[2:37:26] 91Niki: Seems right to me. They don't want people to be fully normal geared super quick. And once you get further into the exp the cap will be lightened
[2:37:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1 per day is alright, but they initially had it 1 per week and it would take 6 months to get the whole set
[2:37:47] valrash1981: Everquest is much more open and interesting at this point in the game. I've enjoyed going back immensely more than I have anything from wow for awhile with classic wrath coming close.
[2:37:50] darthhelmett: got it, thanks man :)
[2:37:56] Aidler: where do you get these storm sigils from?
[2:38:14] 91Niki: Just have 60 alts Kappa You will keep logging in
[2:38:16] stigvader: what level in honor gear
[2:38:26] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @jamzix1 (warning)
[2:38:34] KyleEverett: @valrash1981 Are you on a progression server or are you talking about the live game? EQ1 has it's perks but I like WoW's combat more

[2:38:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: 60 character slots is awesome
[2:38:56] The_Dane_Train: @valrash1981 My ideal MMO would be classic game design with retail class design and per boss raid lockouts.
[2:39:02] valrash1981: Currently running on true box tlp.
[2:39:11] valrash1981: I'm really into using chanter.
[2:39:14] Nerdmeat_: Gimme twilight devastation back.
[2:39:20] 91Niki: and then there is me who is incapable of enjoying anything else than feral druid and ww monk, so i will just have 30 alts of each Kappa
[2:39:27] Aidler: I like borrowed power and never said otherwise
[2:39:35] PanoramicPanda: PanoramicPanda subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:39:36] Pubstar_LTD: what is borrowed power? stuff like  covenants?
[2:39:42] xd_pad: you think there will be unique legendaries like Shadowmourne or Dragonwrath?
[2:39:46] SimonPapeArt: @GaterGator Like THD, who doesn't know what to do without the good grind Kappa
[2:39:46] The_Dane_Train: I don’t think casuals want borrowed power. They want the whole game to be viable, not just to play the patch.
[2:39:52] GamingDad77: @91Niki or me. one of every class...both factions.
[2:39:52] vulkankragon: if this expansion fails then the players will end up being hypocrites for sure
[2:39:58] Royal_T33: There will always be complainers even if the game is perfect
[2:39:58] 91Niki: @Pubstar_LTD Artifact power for weapon like in legion, or neck in bfa
[2:40:07] KyleEverett: I'm glad they seem to be not designing the game around the 1%
[2:40:07] Moobot: Checkout Towelliee's current talent buiilds for all of his characters at https://www.towelliee.com/wowdf-talents.
[2:40:14] Pubstar_LTD: @Pubstar_LTD ah right thanks
[2:40:19] Aidler: @pubstar_ltd apparently stuff you loose at the end of the expansion
[2:40:32] Wadjaah: @Pubstar_LTD stuff like covenant spells, corruption system in BFA, Legion legendaries / weapons abilities etc
[2:40:41] Alaquane: no chores
[2:40:43] The_Dane_Train: @vulkankragon I don’t think so. Dropping borrowed power is great. But it doesn’t fix the casual problem in my opinion.
[2:40:44] 91Niki: @GamingDad77 I wish i could enjoy anything else. But all other classes are just ... boring to me
[2:40:47] exileh1982: as a casual i am happy about the changes so far and considering raiding
[2:40:48] blooodraine: @Towelliee  yes you do proffesions right i gues?
[2:40:49] valrash1981: Charm raid mobs and you have a sick dmg pet, proper dps while you focus a little more on crowed control.
[2:40:52] Lobsterofwar: no more wow homework!
[2:40:54] elagibur11: !origin
[2:41:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: People want to see Evoker, no doubt
[2:41:00] pereadin: gotta farm that M+ score bro KEKW
[2:41:02] Crowald: non-permanent character upgrades that don't transfer with your character to the next expansion.
[2:41:06] SimonPapeArt: oh man playing alts gonna be lit this addons PogChamp
[2:41:13] GamingDad77: @91Niki I like the variety. I call it my MMO ADHD. lol
[2:41:14] KyleEverett: An 8 boss raid actually has me excited, seems much more approachable than 10-12 boss raids
[2:41:26] Bl4ckSauce: No artifact power grind in Dragonflight ?
[2:41:40] Badziee: professions will be the new grind?
[2:41:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I'll be doing a ton of profession grinding and farming mats
[2:41:43] BriscoGDP: Could be cuz I wasn't working for 6 months at the time.. but DF gives me MoP vibes on how alt friendly its gonna be.. at least the end of MOP
[2:41:44] tyler2tall89: Im stoked for professions
[2:42:05] backstreetalright: It is what it is if the game is good then its good and its looking good!
[2:42:14] blooodraine: is in DF expeditions like in BFA?
[2:42:35] 91Niki: Wait so, the ones that aren't account unlock, do alts have to unlock those themselves? @Towelliee
[2:42:48] Aidler: I guess I play some Wrath during DF and maybe D4 will be released soon
[2:42:48] GamingDad77: @91Niki yes mam
[2:42:59] 91Niki: Gotcha
[2:42:59] MR_WYTE: Contemplating taking off work launch day... I expect ... "issues" so maybe the play is to take off the day AFTER launch, heh.
[2:43:05] FallenFighterGaming: this beta?
[2:43:11] GamingDad77: yes
[2:43:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Unfortunate
[2:43:23] valrash1981: I'd like to take a difficulty concept like tarkov's realistic approach and apply that to a sword and board style mmorpg.
[2:43:24] BootySavesLives: Fook fishing
[2:43:25] JBonezey: 10 should be gettable just doing part of the zone
[2:43:26] backstreetalright: Dayum I’m telling everyone about this game I’ll tell you right now
[2:43:26] BootySavesLives: Kappa
[2:43:33] DevilSpire: Sigh
[2:43:35] JasperCalico: @MR_WYTE so long as you're logged into the game 6 hours prior you'll be able to play
[2:43:44] ZeroNpcTV: whats the max renown
[2:43:52] dawkerpy: can you play with the new race if you buy the game now?
[2:43:54] marshmallow110: how much rep did a wq give again?
[2:43:57] CardinalTX: @valrash1981 Have you looked at Dark and Darker?
[2:43:58] GamingDad77: @MR_WYTE I would suggest the friday after launch. get time for the bugs to play out
[2:43:59] kalamari__: 41k rep is exalted for current reps
[2:44:02] dink1487: dink1487 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months! 
[2:44:04] FusionKissMe: Dark and Darker?
[2:44:04] BootySavesLives: yeah no thank you @valrash1981
[2:44:10] valrash1981: I don't think I have.
[2:44:16] Voidheim: Did that say Lava Fishing?!
[2:44:17] HaloS23: @Towelliee Do you think Blizz will go back, over the course of DF, and update old reps to follow the new renown style?
[2:44:20] JBonezey: GOAT XPAC

[2:44:29] Mr_Pennywise_: towNut1 towNut2 towNut3
[2:44:30] SimonPapeArt: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:44:32] 91Niki: @MR_WYTE It depends, do you play on a high pop server? If yes, I wouldn't take the release day off, but rather a day or two later. That way you avoid potential major server issues
[2:44:33] Ezekyler: towNut1
[2:44:35] falldrgn: ripcord pulled..
[2:44:37] valrash1981: I'll take a look at it i think.
[2:44:38] WizkaJ: there is a tarkov like mmo game its called Mortal online
[2:44:53] 91Niki: @MR_WYTE You risk taking a day off, and not being able to play due to server issues
[2:45:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm fine with the gear being locked per character, just not access or currencies
[2:45:15] Arore_1599: I already love Dragonflight... cause Im a Altoholic.... so this is just glorious to me
[2:45:18] PatchMyEye: @MR_WYTE Just take off the entire month 5Head
[2:45:22] Rottencoarse: @MR_WYTE  take the next day off tbf not the release
[2:45:35] caspre01: can only the JC use the trinket or is it tradeable?
[2:45:36] DarqStalker: which one for alchemy?
[2:45:37] CardinalTX: @Arore_1599 Same
[2:45:42] 91Niki: @MR_WYTE Unless you're your own boss, good luck with that ijpKEK
[2:45:45] SpoofAvatar: @Towelliee is the hammer squad community for wow full? when using the code in game it says the code is expired

[2:45:56] DarqStalker: ahhhhh nice
[2:45:59] itsbananas01: Kreygasm Really? Oh gawd
[2:46:00] CardinalTX: I gear a character as best as i can and then move to the next alt
[2:46:09] mabo4tv: So if I go enchanting and just disenchant junk, I'm all good w/o grind? KEKW
[2:46:10] Moobot:  New World Return to Aeternum Stream Event Nov 2nd-18th. This time it's all out war BETWEEN servers. The Hammer Squad is part of the Death Server "Tree's Company" team. APPLICATIONS ARE OPENED See all of the details at Towelliee's website https://www.towelliee.com/new-world
[2:46:16] JasperCalico: so if its already unlocked.. and then I switch professions what happens?
[2:46:18] kowaikokoro: renown character but not account wide PepeLaugh crafters
[2:46:18] Architank: really? that's pretty neat
[2:46:25] hgizaira: Is swapping professions easy?
[2:46:39] Kushisdead3: Will swapping professions be a real pain in the ass when max skill?
[2:46:56] DarqStalker: is this the main hub city?
[2:47:01] backstreetalright: WoW is all about living it up who doesn’t get it is just sadge
[2:47:12] 91Niki: But yeah, in general, I'd never recommend taking the release day off. You'll just end up being one of those people who REEEEE on the forums at blizzard with the "I took this day off from work to play, and now your servers ain't working REEEE" LUL
[2:47:15] LuiBMHunter: 100G to learn!
[2:47:19] ZeroNpcTV: it did
[2:48:00] DarqStalker: can you check alchemy?
[2:48:15] mabo4tv: Nice, thanks
[2:48:29] magicmomentz: is dragonflight out?
[2:48:31] DarqStalker: i mean just to see the recipe
[2:48:46] LuiBMHunter: what if you have two professions?
[2:48:52] riffraff005: @magicmomentz no, just beta right now
[2:48:54] RuthlessWelshy: @magicmomentz no
[2:48:54] 91Niki: @91Niki LUL yeah always expect for shit to hit the fan with servers on launch day. So if you are limited on days off, wait a day or two with taking days off
[2:48:59] SpoofAvatar: twice the work :"
[2:49:02] riffraff005: DF pre-patch content on the 15th
[2:49:06] Slytha_KEKW: does alchemy still has 2 hour flask bonus
[2:49:08] backstreetalright: @magicmomentz  just 25 days left
[2:49:13] riffraff005: then the expansion on November 28th
[2:49:20] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u missed it

[2:49:21] pereadin: @Slytha_KEKW yes
[2:49:24] Architank: do the gathering professions also have renown rank improvements?
[2:49:46] Rottencoarse: oh nvm it was supplies
[2:49:55] Rottencoarse: thought supplies would be alchemy
[2:50:11] DarqStalker: supplies looked like  the herbalism icon
[2:50:14] hgizaira: 14
[2:50:14] PsykosysGG: missed it
[2:50:14] ZeroNpcTV: there alchemy
[2:50:15] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah under centaur
[2:50:16] LuiBMHunter: go back you missed it
[2:50:20] Rottencoarse: missed it
[2:50:21] darthhelmett: @Towelliee no lvl 13
[2:50:27] Alaquane: centaur 13
[2:50:31] Rottencoarse: lvl 13
[2:50:53] DarqStalker: ooooo
[2:51:06] PatLudio: hi. !origin
[2:51:18] PatLudio: !origin
[2:51:24] hgizaira: Does cauldron need any rep again?
[2:51:33] DarqStalker: so we gonna have to grind all those reps?
[2:51:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: If professions make great stuff, then it's worth a grind
[2:51:43] 91Niki: @pereadin So I always have herbing and mining, and keep gear to DE whenever I have gathered a bunch in my bank, swap to enchanting and then back to mining. To be able to sell DE mats. Do you know if that's doable in DF?
[2:51:46] ginfire: @Towelliee is the renown account wide?
[2:51:48] ScalarGaming: should be accountwide
[2:52:07] Alaquane: rooCry archaeology
[2:52:22] JasperCalico: Surely we get archaeology in .1 or .2
[2:52:25] JasperCalico: Copium
[2:52:28] haiil: i tink it is not to control markets, or else people would just swap proffesions to where money is constantly

[2:53:27] jimmix12: do you need it for flask and that stuf ?
[2:53:29] JasperCalico: when isn't there
[2:53:35] JFeezy__: something wrong with twitch.... where do we start lol
[2:53:37] Wadjaah: Is the AH being Region wide already implemented ?
[2:53:46] xd_pad: @ProfessorChaoos LW makes leather and mail
[2:53:47] Plague_GG: @professorchaoos LW
[2:53:54] JBonezey: Bluddshed is a Diablo 3 player
[2:53:58] valrash1981: Bloodshed is a good chill dude
[2:54:07] pereadin: @91Niki I'm not to sure honestly.  I think it is doable, but you'll lose your progress in one profession.  So far on the beta professions server you retain any patterns you've learned but your points and profession are reset to 0.
[2:54:08] adambrowski: can you send work orders to alts?
[2:54:11] valrash1981: Bluddshed even lol.
[2:54:12] DogShep: DrJay is the minmaxing m+ god
[2:54:12] itsbananas01: KEKW Gameplay streamer

[2:54:26] Onearmyof2: highest io dps
[2:54:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: MrGM is cool
[2:54:32] darthhelmett: Yumytv also @Towelliee
[2:54:33] xd_pad: @rohim You can list a work order as Personal, and send it to a specific character, even an alt
[2:54:42] darthhelmett: Growl is funny

[2:54:58] smashwow: @pereadin for fire mage?
[2:55:00] Tac2cul2: you should check out Luxthos if u havent already this morning
[2:55:03] jimmix12: do you think you need rep for flask @Towelliee  ?
[2:55:04] Mr_Pennywise_: LOL
[2:55:07] onlyfeedingfans: did orc racial get nerfed to 15%?
[2:55:09] 91Niki: @91Niki Gotcha. Yeah I looked at beta for mining and herbing early on, and it seemed like there wasn't as in depth a system for herbing and mining as crafting professions. So was hoping I could keep on doing that for max moneyz EZ
[2:55:12] rivera9: mrGM, beta testing LEGION raids scalling for those TMOG farmers
[2:55:12] UnityEverett: POGGERS new world
[2:55:25] DogShep: RTA let's go!!!!
[2:55:27] pereadin: @smashwow just mage in general.  last time i watched him he was practicing frost.
[2:55:38] AmChooka: Yoooo
[2:55:39] 91Niki: POGGERS
[2:55:41] Rottencoarse: oh shit
[2:55:43] JBonezey: Snipperd
[2:55:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Tibalk Is shows my orc racial hardiness at 20% in my spellbook right now
[2:55:57] Rottencoarse: so we winning this thing? :D
[2:56:21] smashwow: @smashwow started to say fire is brain dead. with the insta cast build. all you need to cast is pryos if you get sunking or pyro procs. Frost makes sense. that shit looked awful
[2:56:25] alantin77: is there a list of the new servers yet?

[2:56:32] DogShep: We're winning this thing. 100%
[2:56:34] pereadin: @91Niki sounds like a good plan if the system hasn't changed imo!
[2:56:35] backstreetalright: The thing abou wow is it is the roger federer of gaming - it elevates other games to a diferent status
[2:56:38] JBonezey: btw they have changed at least 1 racial that I haven't seen mentioend in any Blue Post. DI Dwarves went from 25% BS speed to 10%
[2:56:58] Sollice: Let's see if this ifxit kit works
[2:57:19] 91Niki: @91Niki Yeah that's what I have been doing since I went casual. It's a good way to have a steady income and not waste gear by just selling to a vendor when you get upgrades. Cuz enchanting mats sell for a good amount on launch
[2:57:30] senlayan: Says you’re playing WoW
[2:57:32] pereadin: I have my office prepared for maximum Trees Company degeneracy.
[2:57:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Gotta build the doors LUL
[2:57:38] PrimalBF: Wall run stream hype!!!
[2:57:56] UnityEverett: it came out after the release yes
[2:58:11] JBonezey: What if the people you meet along the way are the challenges themselves
[2:58:23] DogShep: I was told I hit things with a mining pick then make them into stabby things. :D Let's go degens!
[2:58:25] pereadin: I'm prepared for anything.  I can live off of 2 hours of sleep.  We gon' get the Win.
