[0:29:49] officialviz: its a better root
[0:29:56] Thoreya: and db got nerfed by 25 secs
[0:30:15] officialviz: yeah they definitely did hurt DB with that and no deep freeze stun on frost
[0:31:03] Thoreya: and the spec trees added nothing flavorful or new
[0:31:11] looney199725: give me a break you can pick up like 5 cc options as mage
[0:31:17] Koosalakoopakoop: I hope Bobby Kotick has a bright, sunny, happy day today

[0:31:23] Thoreya: if they just put out a blue post stating: we think mages have too much and are nerfing them, id be much more okay with that

[0:44:39] Wolfenhoof: Why are you people are calling the sunwalker "paladin" ? ScaredyCat
[0:44:48] Broastbeef: I think they had to rush Paladins in this build. I think in the build they wanted to push it had a different class to be pushed out, however something broke with that class so they pushed this build instead.
[0:44:51] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I was hoping for no paladin, Sloot was ready for some ass eating LOL
[0:44:59] Ooshraxa: In other news: Julio Jones to the Bucs... crazy!

[0:45:39] eenookplay: btw dragonic race have only 1 class avilable or more?
[0:45:43] Gezber: HeyGuys
[0:45:45] Ooshraxa: @Crowargus it's missing interrupt + does not generate HP. Bug!
[0:45:46] ohprawinspree: they always manage to tamper with palis
[0:45:54] manmower: they took the interrupt away from the ability
[0:46:05] Broastbeef: The interrupt isn't an issue, the HP generator is so much an issue.
[0:46:10] Sarocus: Good morning towSip
[0:46:10] Crowargus: ahk lol
[0:46:21] manmower: what does the ability tooltip say now?
[0:46:44] Holysal: @Broastbeef its always interrupted. the HoPo gen you can work with
[0:47:12] akia03: going to be interesting if they can fix all the specs before it releases or some specs just going to be doa at launch
[0:47:13] JellonaCub: its our mass grip

[0:54:14] delaine: Any indication of Kings/Might/Wisdom coming back?

[0:55:55] AerialAce94: atleast pally isn't mage, dear god
[0:56:04] Scrubooze: probably holy
[0:56:06] ashwing_: nah the ardenwield is in the tree too
[0:56:13] Ezekyler: the venthyr is not in paladin general tree
[0:56:23] Spix87: nice that all specs get the chance to go Blessing of Spellwarding
[0:56:27] Ezekyler: splited on a couple fo talents
[0:56:28] volkreig: Of Dusk and Dawn?
[0:56:33] Hu33ard: @Aerialace94 mage isnt even that bad
[0:56:39] ashwing_: in the main tree bottom left
[0:56:41] pavepawns: i like that they tried to make dire beast a possible talent tree build. but with the new talents it did the exact opposite. u can no longer go dire beast while having a normal bm rotation
[0:56:48] AerialAce94: dusk and dawn was a torghast/lego thing
[0:56:50] Alvari: new alpha build Poggers
[0:56:50] Graviits: that is an anima Power i think
[0:56:59] Cranxjs: hey towelliee did u test already ret?
[0:57:05] KaisenSiru: Both
[0:57:18] Madve: do you know any spriests that stream Alpha?
[0:57:20] rohdey: dusk/dawn lego is only good in pvp/torghast
[0:57:27] akia03: @pavepawns and you cant spec animal companion with that build either
[0:57:32] tristanrhyan98: eye if tyr hype!
[0:57:55] Alvari: are they adding up with the alpha content or do they remove the older phases?
[0:58:00] temp3st98: paladin tree isnt that bad but they can fix it Copium
[0:58:03] Cranxjs: ok =) i am just interessed if wrath would be 1 min cd on ret :D
[0:58:09] AerialAce94: a bunch of prot abilities are just broken in alpha right now tho
[0:58:30] volkreig: @Towelliee what ya think of Sentinel?
[0:59:09] AerialAce94: you do get instant wing cooldown tho if you get rightous protector right now
[0:59:44] Lazugo: maybe it has haste to affect cast time?
[0:59:44] pavepawns: @pavepawns yep. they legit changed so no matter what u can now never go dire beast build. before u could atleast make a non optimal build without animal companion too. but now u just straight up cant
[0:59:45] set4812: @Towelliee did they done some update for UI settings?
[0:59:45] mikearpin: maybe a stats placeholder for prof stats later
[0:59:47] jmalmin: What does a skinning knife give you?
[0:59:48] Skizzurp: how much haste you have total and what % haste is it giving?
[0:59:49] Akermay: I thought those stats were placeholder
[0:59:55] donkunn: do u need profession lvl to equip hammer?
[0:59:58] Pusicq: Do you know what happens with the progress you have on your proffessions already when the revamp hits @Towelliee ?
[1:00:23] Juerrilla: isn't that a callback to bc/wotlk when each profession had specific gear enhancements
[1:00:28] Akermay: Seems nuts every profession having to provide that though for balance sake
[1:00:29] jimmywatki: where do they equip to?
[1:00:41] Lantern214: The left side of the pally tree is so lack luster and cookie cut. You want to go straight down the mid, and not the other areas, b/c they dangle wings/ wings upgrades down the middle
[1:00:45] rtucker04: Ti-tan-icum?
[1:00:47] Exoduc: Did he go through all the paladin talents already?

[1:07:42] KAHVITEK: I just hope the raid are relatively easy.
[1:07:46] jmalmin: The most interesting thing to me is the shards you collect which you can use on normal/LFR gear to upgrade it to HC gear by spending shards.
[1:07:49] Shrenko: the new dungeon is The Maw 2.0
[1:07:52] manmower: you all voted for grimrail didn't you?
[1:07:53] slick_rocky: Mythic deadmines!!
[1:07:58] Thoreya: im gearing the monk and rogue for s4.

[1:12:40] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, alpha things don't work. a bunch of shaman talents didn't work last week
[1:12:44] PhillyDilly18: Is the AS lack of interrupt real? Or a bug?
[1:12:57] Phoenixfiend: is avengers shield suppose to silence and interrupt? max was going over the talents and said that it just doesn't do that anymore
[1:12:58] Piekaarz: Hello @Towelliee did u know which hunter spec will be the best as pvm player?
[1:13:14] mrsuflakis: it does not give hp either
[1:13:19] jmalmin: There was a time Dire Maul had a dungeon with a large tree. Said player told the group. need to kill the large trees first... group said they hwere gods and pulled the boss and all teh trees... the player who warned the rest got kicked out of the group....
[1:13:21] manmower: maybe they have to balance it against the new heroic throw multi-target
[1:13:30] Zevn1166: Avengers shield not giving holy power is a feels bad
[1:13:44] Voidheim: @Piekaarz ranged survival Kappa

[1:14:31] Zevn1166: Looking at the tree I honestly think going for toll is a trap with this version of as

[1:20:05] headshot_hunter6: thunder bluff???
[1:20:13] mewkittymon: Under city
[1:20:28] DecayedmiNt: LW can make leg armor again for leg enchant
[1:20:29] Gezber: nop
[1:20:32] temp3st98: no

[1:21:14] Thoreya: ret and prot. not holy
[1:21:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh shit, blessed hammer doesn't work??
[1:21:21] wakeandbacon95: NotLikeThis
[1:21:25] ashwing_: I dont get why they even released these trees if they are not working 99%
[1:21:34] shaxxtv: make blessed hammer base line and make a talent tree where we can buff that shit !!
[1:21:38] shaxxtv: hammerdin all the wayt
[1:21:56] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it appears that mage is having issues as well
[1:22:07] Voidheim: @ashwing_ because it's alpha, and not beta. If it was beta they wouldn't release the trees this early in the dev rounds
[1:22:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I guess all you really need is consecration and avenger's shield
[1:22:42] protegos: #SaveSoil
[1:22:58] Thoreya: @ashwing_ if they didnt release mage trees for feedback now, it wouldve been the biggest disaster ever
[1:23:02] Thoreya: so im glad theyre releasing them
[1:24:26] Skars111: damn wish i got into alpha wanna try out Evoker to see if i like it cant decide on main for DF haha sadge =(

[1:24:54] ashwing_: @ashwing_ You say that but the previous class trees were not this bugged
[1:24:59] Slanderman: @MuzkaTV Ewoker will be playable doing pre-patch they said :)
[1:25:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mages have been spazzing

[1:25:05] YardRage: inconsolable LUL
[1:25:16] mavericks312: the mage class tree was wild I will say that
[1:25:42] Voidred: Voidred subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:26:06] temp3st98: im happy we got long arm but it needs 45% speed instead of 20% and we got back exorcism but that needs a rework aswell, like make it proc with art of war :/
[1:26:09] DoctorGhostPepper: any elder scrolls on line fans here?
[1:26:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was watching some Venruki and I don't think mage trees are as bad as some people claim
[1:26:28] silodin: The alpha is litterly unplayable for me atm. mainly because i wasn't flagged.
[1:26:35] Norbi33: thet's a bug i think
[1:26:38] manmower: it's showing a CD marker around it
[1:27:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, inner light can be crazy
[1:27:37] JellonaCub: did ret aura have old text still?
[1:27:47] shaxxtv: test steed with 2 charges
[1:28:08] shaxxtv: could be same thing as blessed hammer

[1:28:29] Thoreya: reeeeeee
[1:28:30] Voidheim: @misterbreadcrum bugged most likely
[1:28:36] Snabido: SMOrc Let the man do this thing
[1:28:41] Zevn1166: No hp from as kinda sucks
[1:28:45] Slanderman: @MuzkaTV That it is! :D
[1:28:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like grand crusader
[1:28:53] misterbreadcrum: Oh okay I was really worried
[1:29:21] subversv: i did a dungeon last night as prot and my wings cool down kept resetting
[1:29:40] RiskyBusines_ez: attackers hmm
[1:29:43] manmower: it has to be people who attacked you
[1:29:48] vaddah: It's damage to attackers
[1:29:52] paldankt: They have to hit you for the dmg maybe?
[1:30:10] rohdey: use a training dummy that attacks back
[1:30:14] Hu33ard: try on tanking dummy
[1:30:15] RiskyBusines_ez: attackers seem like people who attack you
[1:30:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Attackers take damage, it's a kind of reflection when they hit you, it seems

[1:31:55] ZyntosAran: damn, everytime I see the talent trees I am like "I NEED IT, GIVE ME, I want to relevel chars with it on another server"
[1:32:26] ZyntosAran: @hikaritd they are probably really small, dont put your hopes up getting one until beta"

[1:36:12] misterbreadcrum: @Towelliee any intuition on why they removed Holy Power generation from Avenger's Shield? Is that a bug or a design choice?
[1:36:56] TixesDT: @steldam Wasnt it F6? But you can bind it to any key.
[1:36:57] xcting: crit also went up 2% instead of 4%

[1:42:54] vaddah: probably because you are at full health
[1:43:03] RiskyBusines_ez: ful hp?
[1:43:06] Shifty_CZ: thats current conduit no?
[1:43:13] Shifty_CZ: golden path
[1:43:15] Molvonos: I mean, all those BDK, Shaman, Hunter, Spriest, and Evoker VODs
[1:43:16] Thoriakk: @Towelliee do you think they will leave avenger shield without interrupt ?
[1:43:22] Molvonos: Hmm
[1:43:46] Shmoz: I really wish they would bring back long arm of the law/ burdn of guilt combo. Such a good gap closer for PvP compared to what we have now.
[1:43:57] 91Niki: @Molvonos Literally LUL
[1:44:00] Thoriakk: @Towelliee do you think they will leave avenger shield without interrupt ?
[1:44:04] Shmoz: burden*

[1:44:27] Kindosar: just stand in con and don't attack? just requires you to stand in it right?
[1:44:30] Snabido: Does that consecration passive affect it, from earlier in tree
[1:44:33] mavericks312: towelshaman has been my favorite so far lol
[1:44:49] TixesDT: @Towelliee Try F5 or F6 while hovering that talent it should open report windows right for that talent.
[1:45:13] Molvonos: towSip
[1:45:35] ijuki: You can keybind it
[1:45:45] TixesDT: Yes it must be unbound then.
[1:46:13] Gezber: hehe
[1:46:39] BoezIRL: pvp talent
[1:46:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: crusader aura? eh
[1:47:28] Stiffy84: morning towelliee and chat! towHi towHi
[1:47:31] manmower: choice node bop or avenger shield silence
[1:47:32] misterbreadcrum: true, wtf are they thinking
[1:47:41] Aquadriel: remove it!
[1:47:47] TixesDT: Try with mount but without aura
[1:47:51] Sanitizah: im late, what they do to avengers shield
[1:48:18] thepaladinjournal: rebuke should be a much earlier talent
[1:48:32] captiv8: Holy doesn’t have it on live. So it kind of makes sense where it’s at
[1:48:46] Snabido: Turn Evil on galakrond's undead minions 😏
[1:48:46] tlsmith3638: i heard there was a guest class dev for pallies this time around Ghostcrawer
[1:48:46] imnotdruish: imnotdruish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 71 months, currently on a 71 month streak! 
[1:49:00] phattboi_80: AS doesn't interrupt anymore?
[1:49:20] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee I'm surprised by the test-state of AS - You'd think that they had tested the iconic class/spec talents thoroughly
[1:49:27] TixesDT: Try Seal of the Templar with mount but without aura, you tested only with aura.
[1:49:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: That absorb shield is almost as good as bear's Ursoc's Fury
[1:50:04] manmower: paladins looking strong
[1:50:04] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[1:50:17] Gezber: same damage DansGame
[1:50:22] Cranxjs: 12 dmg +
[1:50:23] TheItalianStallion321: should be around 90
[1:50:24] TheItalianStallion321: yeah
[1:50:24] Talason: listen the new talents may be underwhelming but at least they got rid of borrowed power
[1:50:26] danielthegathering: maybe need relog to work
[1:50:34] Rob3phones: should be hitting in the 90s non crit
[1:50:36] tiranz__: 95 no
[1:50:38] Snabido: 12 if 80dmg
[1:50:42] Darzetti_: 92
[1:50:42] silodin: àt least 73
[1:50:47] jimmywatki: 24
[1:50:48] nvnto: 25
[1:50:48] danielthegathering: 193
[1:50:48] RiskyBusines_ez: 25,2
[1:50:49] misterbreadcrum: 33.6
[1:50:49] Hyoss: 15% of 84 os 12.8
[1:50:50] Gezber: 25
[1:50:54] vaddah: Is the 15% the damage granted by having it last 1 second longer?
[1:50:56] captiv8: 25.2
[1:50:57] tiranz__: 95 no crit and 190 crit
[1:51:00] TheItalianStallion321: 10% of 80 is 8 so it should hit around 90
[1:51:00] Hyoss: should be 96-97
[1:51:01] steldam: 12 more
[1:51:02] aLargeBoke: 32.33 repeating, of course
[1:51:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: 25, yeah
[1:51:07] pigzip: 105
[1:51:08] gunnar50o1: are the damage ticks the same speed? rather than increased numbers maybe it's time
[1:51:12] Bassodia: should be hitting ~94

[1:51:22] manmower: is it snapshotting? maybe back off
[1:51:25] tiranz__: yep not working
[1:51:53] Gezber: tooltip is wrong tho
[1:52:41] nvnto: @Towelliee i think if you skill the point you can report the passive via the report keybind in your spell book
[1:52:54] Gezber: for the heal over time
[1:53:14] nvnto: default is F6 if you hover over stuff
[1:53:20] Syrss: so, Avenger shield still interrupt or it's intended the tooltip on the wowhead tree?
[1:53:25] JamesBtw: So far very fluid or not many option choices towelliee ?
[1:53:42] nvnto: skill it and look at the passive in your spell book @Towelliee
[1:53:45] steldam: In spell book
[1:53:49] AerialAce94: hover over in spellbook
[1:54:07] Hyoss: @Towelliee learn talent, then find passiv ein book, then hover and press F6
[1:54:36] andycoin99: sac on a 1 min wow
[1:54:44] andycoin99: that sounds strong
[1:55:38] TixesDT: spender
[1:55:41] Ooshraxa: spender
[1:55:41] IianaDRK: spender
[1:55:54] RioosLive: Go to single target dummy
[1:55:55] Pannekaker: Try it on a single dummy, could be easier to tell
[1:56:14] wakeandbacon95: NotLikeThis
[1:56:56] Brotcore: more haste!
[1:57:07] wakeandbacon95: SeemsGood
[1:57:32] Norbi33: if you ask me.. so far pala talent looks the hardest to test if 50% of the talent does not even work :P
[1:57:38] Shablagoosh: 1075
[1:57:54] nvnto: 1075 1084 1075
[1:57:55] Lazermage23: 1075-1084
[1:57:57] danielthegathering: do you play with personal resource under your char on retail?
[1:58:05] IianaDRK: should be under 1k at least
[1:58:14] Shablagoosh: thats prob right
[1:58:25] jolehin: Are ret talents out too?
[1:58:30] wTFologie: Aveng Shield no longer gives HP?
[1:58:31] Gezber: about 20%
[1:58:41] TixesDT: 917 + 20% = 1100
[1:58:42] jimmywatki: 186
[1:58:43] misterbreadcrum: 186?
[1:58:44] MaleFrom73: 1124
[1:58:44] RiskyBusines_ez: 187
[1:58:44] nvnto: ret and prot are out for paladin @jolehin
[1:58:46] IianaDRK: would be about 184 difference
[1:58:47] Xteee14: 186 ish
[1:58:48] falldrgn: is wailing arrow worth it as BM?
[1:58:48] LewkarnTV: Have you tried the new dungeon yet ? :)
[1:58:54] zastin586: 185,4
[1:58:59] Ooshraxa: ye, that's about 10%
[1:58:59] sselesu: 20% of 1075 is 215
[1:59:09] sselesu: its like 10% not 20%
[1:59:09] AerialAce94: its close enough probably some other dice rolls in there affecting stuff
[1:59:15] NinjaChane: numbers are off
[1:59:21] TixesDT: @sselesu but this is wrong. You ened 20% from value before increase and add it.
[1:59:21] manmower: still reduced by their defensives
[1:59:22] Mehlwyrm: but u need to take 900 and add 20%, not 1100 and take 20% off
[1:59:30] IianaDRK: variance on damage is difficult to see the exact percentage, but it seems a bit less than 20%
[1:59:31] TixesDT: @Mehlwyrm this
[1:59:35] sselesu: @sselesu oh thats right
[1:59:36] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee maybe it's working, but the second point isn't working?
[1:59:36] Cranxjs: maybe take redoubt off?
[1:59:40] manmower: it's doing more than 10%
[1:59:41] NinjaChane: 20% should be about 350 ish
[1:59:46] Cranxjs: so u dont get stacking buff
[1:59:52] tristanrhyan98: try with just one point
[1:59:58] Mehlwyrm: what, the 20% is definitly working
[2:00:03] manmower: do the first point
[2:00:07] manmower: then do the second point separately
[2:00:08] Sarocus: Adding 20% doesn't give you the same value as reducing by 20%
[2:00:29] Mehlwyrm: it totally works xD
[2:00:30] RioosLive: You should count increasing not reducing from when you’re specd
[2:00:39] TixesDT: 1062 should be
[2:00:42] danielthegathering: use combat log
[2:00:46] TixesDT: with 2 points
[2:01:03] Cranxjs: xDD´this crits
[2:01:05] TixesDT: 973 with 1
[2:01:16] sselesu: 885 974
[2:01:16] Cranxjs: 885
[2:01:16] Ooshraxa: 885
[2:01:16] Shablagoosh: 885
[2:01:17] MTCason: 885
[2:01:18] TixesDT: 885 > 973 > 1062
[2:01:19] Babyginko: That's +10%
[2:01:21] Lazermage23: 885 * 1.2 should be around 973.5
[2:01:30] Lazermage23: (1.1 correction)
[2:01:32] NinjaChane: that's about right
[2:01:38] Vosy1984: WAYTOODANK
[2:01:39] manmower: it's actually giving more than 10%, you should report that
[2:01:45] sselesu: yeah its working
[2:01:49] Mehlwyrm: a lot of crit u got xD
[2:01:59] Gezber: good
[2:02:00] TixesDT: works erfect
[2:02:04] IianaDRK: it looks about right

[2:03:00] nightwolf_87: background picture and weapon is awsome :D
[2:03:05] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee be careful, doesn't pay well and doesn't pay at all are 2 different things, :D which means that it does pay something to be a number bitch
[2:03:14] sselesu: read latter part
[2:03:19] Kriven: arcane mage tree is so bad :{
[2:03:24] endakenny: yes
[2:03:26] Cranxjs: yeas
[2:03:30] zastin586: It's a separate spell that can combine with AW, in case you don't spec into AW
[2:03:38] raye_gaming22: yea there is a nromal AW and a buffed AW from the spec tree
[2:03:39] ShadoodHD: pally talent tree feels kinda dirty >:(
[2:03:39] endakenny: you get the crit
[2:03:46] Cranxjs: normaly wrath has no crit
[2:03:47] IianaDRK: its a separate cooldown incase u dont talent wings, but adds the effect of both if u do have it specced
[2:04:00] Redbearded16: @towelliee big T how you doing brother. Lets see this prot action
[2:04:01] Mehlwyrm: @Kriven thought so as well, watched the fired up stream now i feel okayish about it, feelsbadman though that they nerfed the kyrian/orb/arcane harmony interaction
[2:04:08] raye_gaming22: the buffed AW has the dmg amp and crit together
[2:04:12] MasterNewt: It's a different AW. If you have original AW they pair up
[2:04:27] CodyKane: CodyKane subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Prot Pally!! lets go!!
[2:04:41] raye_gaming22: it should if you pop wings

[2:04:48] teachertoone: teachertoone subscribed with Prime. 
[2:05:05] IianaDRK: might be worth testing might without talenting base wings

[2:05:18] nvnto: it might get applied globally, i think boomkin had sth similar
[2:05:24] nvnto: so it doesnt show in the tooltip
[2:05:28] nvnto: on the character frame
[2:05:37] wreckshoptv: you been too the new zone yet?
[2:05:37] endakenny: as far as I remember it doesn't show the increased crit in the character sheet on live either
[2:05:41] Cranxjs: on retail it doesnt show
[2:05:51] Kriven: @Mehlwyrm honestly i hated how kyrian played in shadowlands i was not happy they brought that forward
[2:06:29] Mehlwyrm: @Kriven arent u good then? u can play the orb/arcane missile stuff, or pure arcane blast, they flat out destroyed the kyrian playstyle
[2:06:36] wakeandbacon95: we'll take that one
[2:06:40] ShadoodHD: some of the talents are from legos aren't they...?
[2:06:42] BoldBalls: LUL
[2:07:19] Kriven: @Mehlwyrm nope the spec is all over the place and the synergy just isn't there. It needed reworked before but this didnt help
[2:07:38] raye_gaming22: @ShadoodHD thats for every spec the backed legos azerite and artefacts togheter in one tree
[2:08:05] WannabeHero99: Not going to lie ._. Ret pally talent interactions with consecration look fun AF
[2:08:10] Mehlwyrm: @Kriven that is true, synergy is quite low, the specc simply doenst work right now cause the aura is underbuffed, arcane blast could do with a 50% dmg increase and it would be just "fine"
[2:08:22] Zettabyte: Numbrrrrrs
[2:08:26] Aladdyn88: retri will be overpowered love it
[2:08:31] Lazermage23: DO it on the single target add for easier number verification
[2:08:39] silodin: ì'm coming up with 33.3 repeating ofcourse, percentage of survival
[2:08:41] Gezber: 885 or so
[2:08:45] Kriven: @Mehlwyrm yeah hopefully they show arcane some love but i won't hold my breath lol
[2:08:47] BoezIRL: 1060
[2:08:53] BoezIRL: with buff
[2:09:04] ShadoodHD: i recognize the mad paragon talent, especially the dusk and dawn talent 🤮
[2:09:17] BoezIRL: yeah

They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[2:09:21] Mehlwyrm: @Kriven yeah my hope died pretty fast, i think the arcane tree is just very messed up and even if they fix it, it will be just bandaid fixes
[2:09:29] silodin: The numbers don't lie! and they spell disaster for all of you
[2:09:53] Gezber: try the heal too
[2:09:59] ShadoodHD: wait they put rebuke in this wtf WutFace
[2:10:03] midfx1: looks good
[2:10:10] nuubkeike: Will you test retribution?
[2:10:30] Mehlwyrm: @Kriven so u might see a variant of todays kyrian mage in some fights, but i dont think the mana management arcane is flat out too weak even with some of the talents working for him
[2:10:45] Mehlwyrm: is too weak
[2:10:46] Ooshraxa: @ShadoodHD my exact response. odd that its not baseline
[2:10:48] Mehlwyrm: -.-
[2:10:51] wakeandbacon95: SeemsGood
[2:11:08] mavericks312: @mehlwyrm atm frost and fire are way ahead of arcane

[2:11:31] Mehlwyrm: ye sadly, cause its base kit is shit and t set is horrible
[2:11:45] Mehlwyrm: mainly the very bad t set, in season 2 kyrian arcane was fine
[2:11:56] Towelliee: 1065 2186
[2:12:11] mavericks312: @mehlwyrm honestly it maybe time to rethink the whole arcane charge thing at this point
[2:12:15] itssnotblake: what UI are you using ?
[2:12:32] Shablagoosh: 315 or something
[2:12:33] Zuhbuumafu: about 300
[2:12:34] captiv8: 319.5
[2:12:34] RiskyBusines_ez: 319
[2:12:35] nvnto: 319
[2:12:37] inj0shwetrust: roughly 400
[2:12:54] Hyoss: @OTKblake that is base UI now (as per Alpha)
[2:12:56] Zuhbuumafu: 30% of 1000 is 300
[2:12:58] Mehlwyrm: @mavericks312 i think its only problem is the very low arcane blast dmg, with 4 stacks, costing like 15% of ur mana they just deal dmg like a pyro, less then most class abilities
[2:13:03] Zuhbuumafu: i prefer simple math
[2:13:08] itssnotblake: oh @hyoss it looks good
[2:13:19] NinjaChane: should be right around 1385
[2:13:34] Mehlwyrm: @mavericks312 buff up the arcane blast dmg by a lot, then the mana management variant gets good
[2:13:46] Ezekyler: 1 damage towPog
[2:13:51] ThaYetii: pleeeasseee let me see the funny ancient kings
[2:13:54] heavenphist: eye of tyr whoa nicee
[2:13:54] ashwing_: Pog 1 damage
[2:13:55] Holytumtumz: Yo toweliee what is your webcam?
[2:14:05] mavericks312: @mehlwyrm buff AB then try to fix the mana management imo
[2:14:07] Bassodia: m+ Pog
[2:14:09] Shablagoosh: That burn damage seems cool even if its not good
[2:14:22] Pannekaker: Love that
[2:14:26] LSBreed: insta aoe threat grab
[2:14:26] BoezIRL: it's not 1

[2:14:50] mavericks312: @mehlwyrm like atm it looks like I'll be frost for my 3rd xpac
[2:15:06] Sarocus: Like mages having a talent that reduces damage by 3000%
[2:15:08] wazon_7: mage has a talent that reduces magic dmg by 6000%
[2:15:17] ThaYetii: DO IT
[2:15:17] Mehlwyrm: @mavericks312 i mean they attempted it with the new arcane power/surge thing and evocation legy + improves mana gem, but u  simply will never play arcane blast/manadeplete cause it deals no dmg and is harder to handle

[2:16:32] Shrapnel_Sponge: ret looks super fun though, also we got exorcism back
[2:16:36] Mehlwyrm: @mavericks312 might be a pvp thing, if u get 4 stacks and insta blasted with mind thingy it might be too strong, but right now arcance feels like crap, but also not getting the improved arcane orb from pvp feels bad as well
[2:16:39] Thoreya: 125 years pog

[2:18:18] vaddah: 5% is gonna be hard to tell with that little sample size
[2:18:29] Gezber: KEKW
[2:18:43] zorantt: @Towelliee Think I found a tooltip bug on Wowhead. Not sure if it's the same on alpha. The concentration/devotion aura says required warriors (on Wowhead's DF talent calc).
[2:18:49] TixesDT: player testing would be perfect
[2:18:53] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Ezekyler NE pala when? towCopium
[2:18:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: We need a volunteer to hit him!

[2:21:10] Hyoss: or each gives 5%
[2:21:11] TixesDT: isnt it 20% without other bonusees
[2:21:12] Shrapnel_Sponge: try it with 1/2 as well and see if it increases by 5%
[2:21:13] baldpet: is it 20% of your current block?
[2:21:15] manmower: might have worded it wrong
[2:21:16] Hyoss: can test with 1 point into it
[2:21:26] kimezada: wait is avenger shield supposed to do 1200 damage? seems a bit weak
[2:21:30] sh1asurprise: sh1asurprise subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months!

[2:21:36] Ekazz: @Ekazz IDK if that's the truth, but I would'nt be surprised tbh lol
[2:21:41] manmower: bug
[2:21:46] TheItalianStallion321: is it a flat 20%? or 20% of what you have?
[2:21:56] manmower: luckily paladins can't block magic too
[2:22:05] Ekazz: What's sad is that, lots of us wants in to actually TEST shit and give feedback lol
[2:22:05] Jokervenom1978: Man all this reporting Towelliee. Never took you for a snitch. towSip
[2:22:11] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning! towHAMUP
[2:22:20] Mehlwyrm: tbh its not like paladins are too tanky now, they are squishy af so iam fine with that high block ^^
[2:22:46] Hyoss: @baldpet 20% of 40 would be 8m so 48% not 50.

[2:23:37] TixesDT: small sample size..
[2:23:37] Vosy1984: do those work in pvp the same?
[2:24:13] draftbrew: that seems to be working
[2:24:16] Shablagoosh: That seems like way more than 5%
[2:24:18] JellonaCub: Ret looking fun in duels. Like it was in classic
[2:24:30] Shifty_CZ: Holycow losing to concecration
[2:24:34] Bassodia: doesnt mastery also reduce dmg on consacration?
[2:24:36] TixesDT: move combat log pls
[2:24:41] Aquadriel: turn your back for no block @Towelliee
[2:24:44] pinguim775: @Shablagoosh already has the reduction because of mastery
[2:24:48] wazon_7: 322
[2:24:50] wazon_7: 32*
[2:24:57] cyraxva: you think Holy Pally will be good in Dragonflight?

[2:25:18] Goodzerker: blocks
[2:25:19] wazon_7: seems to be working
[2:25:22] ijuki: @Goodzerker monkaS
[2:25:31] Gezber: it's more than 5%
[2:25:33] TixesDT: @Towelliee move combat log if you want help with numbers :)
[2:25:40] vaddah: test inside consacration even when not taking the talent, since as chat suggested mastery should be working anyway
[2:25:45] bobbydons: 3.33 repeating of course
[2:25:49] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Goodzerker hol up LUL
[2:25:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh gawd ERP LUL
[2:25:58] TixesDT: good
[2:26:03] wakeandbacon95: gachiGASM
[2:26:11] draftbrew: beautiful
[2:26:25] Cranxjs: vaddah is right , use consacration
[2:26:55] TixesDT: 654 average normal hit
[2:27:10] Hyoss: 32
[2:27:16] Hyoss: 30-32
[2:27:17] TixesDT: 32 > 622
[2:27:25] Goodzerker: 30ish
[2:27:28] Hyoss: so should end up at 610-620
[2:27:28] NinjaChane: should be 620ish
[2:27:42] Gezber: way less
[2:27:43] TixesDT: broken
[2:27:50] Cranxjs: u should test both in consacration, vaddah brings up mastery
[2:27:51] Hyoss: it is double
[2:27:51] Goodzerker: its working though
[2:27:55] JellonaCub: Mastery @towelliee
[2:27:55] procyon_mfc: thats 10%
[2:27:56] Hyoss: more like 10%
[2:27:56] NinjaChane: yeah way more
[2:27:56] manmower: does consecrate have other functionality baseline?
[2:27:57] Neruan: mastery
[2:28:01] madbombz_fth: that around 10%
[2:28:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that's more than 5% but we don't need to report that LUL
[2:28:03] Bassodia: mastery
[2:28:04] Zevn1166: @towelliee mastery
[2:28:05] Doomedsaint: The talent is for an Additional 5%. Aren't there other modifiers?
[2:28:07] Gezber: it's about 10-12%
[2:28:10] addemannen00: test only one point

[2:28:16] Shrapnel_Sponge: your mastery counts as well so it's about 12%
[2:28:16] TixesDT: oh
[2:28:21] Goodzerker: oh!
[2:28:22] Gezber: ok, then it's good
[2:28:26] Gezber: 5+7=12
[2:28:27] madbombz_fth: then its good
[2:28:28] Goodzerker: so its right
[2:28:30] manmower: but he was in the consecrate already before
[2:28:30] TixesDT: correct
[2:28:31] NinjaChane: then that's right
[2:28:41] addemannen00: test 0 points
[2:28:42] Dystilled: take off all your gear?
[2:28:45] NinjaChane: it seems right
[2:28:46] Ralykx: seems right when you factor in the mastery and the talent
[2:28:47] Hyoss: check with consecration but without the talent
[2:28:47] Goodzerker: yes do it talentless
[2:28:50] TixesDT: @manmower was he ?

[2:28:57] convrge: Get naked!
[2:29:02] Crafty_plays: 7.4%+5%=12% which is about what you were seeing
[2:29:02] Shrapnel_Sponge: @manmower no he wasn't.
[2:29:08] Twe4ky: seems like both rowk.. reduction was around 12%
[2:29:08] NinjaChane: I figured it was roughly 12%
[2:29:09] Bassodia: YEP
[2:29:18] TixesDT: concs + no talent should be 622 average
[2:29:28] NinjaChane: take the 7% Mastery away and you get 5%
[2:29:33] ashnmsr: it's not working
[2:29:41] ashnmsr: the talent i meant
[2:29:54] Shrapnel_Sponge: do you have any additional consecrate talents up though?
[2:29:54] TixesDT: 577 average
[2:30:18] manmower: it might be working if it is taking the % off of the overall unmitigated dmg before armor
[2:30:21] Gezber: KEKW

[2:32:41] Thoreya: LUL
[2:32:54] Defocus: so avenger shield is gone forever BibleThump
[2:32:58] TixesDT: how much gives it default ?
[2:33:00] Gezber: how much does it normally give?
[2:33:01] NinjaChane: lmao
[2:33:03] vaddah: SOTR increases armor bu default :D
[2:33:06] draftbrew: lol it doubled
[2:33:13] NinjaChane: it doubled
[2:33:14] Honvar: @stabzmcgeee Oh no, they should remove his acces immediately! Kappa
[2:33:19] TixesDT: oh so it boost its value not your base armor
[2:33:21] JellonaCub: Shield always gives armor. need to test with and without for ex
[2:33:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: More math!
[2:33:22] Gezber: just take it away and look at the number
[2:33:26] TixesDT: Yes
[2:33:48] Goodzerker: Sheild of the righteos gives a baseline armor from your actual sheild
[2:34:02] vaddah: 3641
[2:34:05] Gezber: 1661 - 3041 (59.29)
[2:34:06] Defocus: so i heard avenger gives no silence or holy power anymore does that make divine toll useless now?
[2:34:12] Norbi33: bingo xD
[2:34:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: 59.29
[2:34:14] Honvar: 420 and 69? Kappa
[2:34:16] TixesDT: +1980 without talent

[2:35:03] TixesDT: work percectly
[2:35:07] Hyoss: 3680 - 3641
[2:35:08] Goodzerker: its working
[2:35:13] RioosLive: What a terrible talent
[2:35:13] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[2:35:14] TixesDT: 1980 + 2% = 2019
[2:35:15] RocketMan23: no thats garbage
[2:35:16] Bergsholt: Almost no difference
[2:35:18] Velerio: 39 armor
[2:35:18] manmower: the higher your armor the stronger it gets
[2:35:19] pogs4pepe: 0.3% extra def lol
[2:35:25] derry10: its 2% of your current armor, might be better when you get more armor from gear
[2:35:32] Goodzerker: might not be worth it but might be worth getting to get into another deeper talent
[2:35:46] Gezber: KEKW
[2:35:48] draftbrew: being so deep in the tree you'd expect something a tad better maybe
[2:35:50] ashnmsr: omg op 0%
[2:35:50] Goodzerker: Its just a linking talent
[2:35:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: If something else synergizes then it could be more worth it
[2:35:57] Cranxjs: its worth cuz of the talents below xD
[2:36:02] hnti86: + 0% POGGERS
[2:36:07] manmower: turns your block off if you Word of Glory, sounds fair
[2:36:13] RioosLive: It's one of those shitty that they put just so that you have to spend extra points to get to something stronger.
[2:36:13] ashnmsr: so it's 5% / 10%
[2:36:19] snuffles_80: says 10% each point on wowhead
[2:36:22] Boosti661: Now this is alpha testing
[2:36:35] datcreepa: ticket!
[2:36:40] Gezber: it actually works now lol
[2:36:41] Velerio: did not apply
[2:36:44] ashnmsr: they fixed the other talent lol
[2:36:48] Twe4ky: apply changes first
[2:36:57] JellonaCub: apply changes
[2:37:07] RocketMan23: it was working with sotr i though

[2:37:50] Defocus: paladin gonna need alot of bug reports please save us
[2:38:05] manmower: can it only proc so many time per minute?
[2:38:06] ashnmsr: it's 1 haste though not 1%
[2:38:11] Cranxjs: ur haste got flat numbers
[2:38:13] TixesDT: I would say they are not tasting at all they just release it and let ppl test it for free

[2:38:48] Defocus: whoever is working on paladins atm, dear lord help us
[2:38:49] brewgamingtv: 2%. U start at 9% and first one gave you 10% then 18stack gave you another %
[2:38:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that needs tuned up
[2:38:59] manmower: did it says 12 haste per stack? seems like it is bugged
[2:39:02] Hyoss: @ahupnatun more than half of the talents have bugs
[2:39:04] llNoTToXiCll: i wish they would bring back the old school stat panal that showed your damage and all that it looks super boring now
[2:39:14] Daarksyde: are you sure the shield of rightous was actually hitting the dumby? it looks like you get the armor buff but it does not look like it was doing dmg
[2:39:23] Hu33ard: its a % increase and you have a low number to begin with so it wont increase much at all
[2:39:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: block went from 40% to 50%
[2:39:30] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[2:41:40] sipsac: divine toll is there !! nice
[2:41:45] Daarksyde: make sure your shield of righteous is actually doing dmg. It looked like it was not but only giving you the armor buff
[2:41:50] Ooshraxa: @SollowJP always good to have several independent reports
[2:41:58] Norbi33: 7-8k feelsgood

[2:43:45] Darzetti_: that is sick

[2:43:55] haalxd: dont think divine resonance works though
[2:43:59] misterbreadcrum: WAS the best button in the game before it stopped generating HP
[2:44:01] Siddydiddydo: I use it currently too, still feels so satisfying
[2:44:08] panvoker: does the aoe explosion for the tyrs work with the extra bounces?

[2:44:50] Gezber: that's... a lot
[2:44:55] sipsac: 12 targets
[2:44:56] sipsac: lol
[2:44:57] Terminalbandoh: each hit bounces as normal
[2:45:04] Deekan33: 12 hits?
[2:45:05] Siddydiddydo: each shield bounces right
[2:45:20] tornbraclet: why dont you just go to the training grounds and test your spec
[2:45:24] RioosLive: It will bounce
[2:45:42] Siddydiddydo: you had 3 spread out back the last time, where 4 went forward on that try
[2:45:42] Terminalbandoh: 4 targets plus 2 bounces of each i think
[2:46:02] Lostdogal: @Lostdogal don't know why I was expecting better
[2:46:07] RioosLive: Spec into the one that makes it to not bounce.
[2:46:12] Ooshraxa: literally have shields coming out of the bull-ass :D
[2:46:23] zorantt: wasn't the original DT supposed to be uncapped? @Towelliee
[2:46:25] Siddydiddydo: it's really forcing you down those trees too
[2:46:31] zorantt: when hitting things
[2:46:47] misterbreadcrum: no good reason to have DR if it doesn't passively generate HP
[2:47:10] Niegoss: of seraphim, not divine toll
[2:47:12] manmower: do you even have the point to use?
[2:47:16] Gezber: yep broken
[2:47:21] manmower: it says 0 points available
[2:47:30] ShaolinPotato: @sideric yeah the Ret tree is guaranteed to always pick Final Reckoning because of the seraphim proc, the loaded 1 side and the opposite side is jank
[2:47:36] ashnmsr: xD
[2:47:39] Jollywhompus: Chat needs their coffee obv
[2:47:48] isseidahk: maybe lol
[2:47:52] Niegoss: @Towelliee it reduces cooldown of seraphim not divine toll
[2:48:01] Gezber: it's both
[2:48:08] llNoTToXiCll: coffee is overrated and used as a tool
[2:48:09] valorn01: Does the CDR work if you have seraphim?
[2:48:10] the_sovereign94: @cowb0ycrab I want crusader+ final reckoning + divine toll is it posible?
[2:48:10] Shrapnel_Sponge: this is a lego effect atm so should work
[2:48:11] dark_fluxes: the shield isent interrupting any more!
[2:48:14] szble: Pepega Clap
[2:48:15] Niegoss: oh, my bad
[2:48:16] Siddydiddydo: funny that they put the divine toll on the right side, and the extra shield bounce on the left side
[2:48:16] OlympicPNW: Thats the Girdle of Unity second leggo ability
[2:48:21] Gezber: the Divine Toll part doesn't work
[2:48:26] manmower: try to use divine toll and see if the CD displays 45s and if it's just a tooltip error
[2:48:29] Gezber: KEKW
[2:48:34] flebbooo: Any sec now KEKW
[2:48:45] Gezber: @manmower it displayed 60
[2:48:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: no resonance PepeHands
[2:48:49] sipsac: prot paladin treee is flawless
[2:48:50] Cranxjs: capt is busy ;D
[2:48:51] Norbi33: wait for the joke first :D
[2:48:51] RocketMan23: wait for iiiiiiiiiiit
[2:48:52] ShaolinPotato: @the_s0vereign yes but you wont have Resonance and you'll have to give up maybe something else. but its possible
[2:48:54] federkleid_: divine resonance also gives you a buff but you didn't get it
[2:49:01] captiv8: you would almost think this is "alpha" or something
[2:49:05] the_sovereign94: @cowb0ycrab I see
[2:49:13] ashnmsr: should say passive
[2:49:26] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP Morning Towelliee
[2:49:36] sqknarf: @Lostdogal i think everyone was, they put a few new things in but its mainly the same thing they did when they switched to what we have now, it's just converting it into a talent tree
[2:49:39] abracka_: "release in 2022"
[2:49:43] Daarksyde: can only imagine why holy is not launched...
[2:49:46] manmower: they probably wanted to get early feedback on placement of talents in the trees to start working it
[2:49:50] burnsie5511: Making everything work is the easy part
[2:49:55] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee hey, you wanted the tree to be out :D you got what you wanted

[2:50:27] Roobi_doobi: Holy is going to be fucked

[2:53:52] ashnmsr: Just tell them. " it works perfectly "
[2:53:54] vaddah: tbh doesn't sound like a bug, it's just random numbers trown in tbh
[2:53:56] Raugdel: Work fine, nice design Kappa
[2:53:56] tr1ckshot22: Bug: I have access to all high level cooldowns at all times...GODMODE Activated
[2:53:57] ShaolinPotato: @the_s0vereign You have enough points to get FR, DT, and Crusade. Your last point can be used for either Resonance or Liadrin
[2:53:59] Hyoss: it works but reduces cd unfairly
[2:53:59] manmower: tell them to make it 0.1seconds instead of 100seconds
[2:54:00] BardtheBowman: Works too well.  Constant up time
[2:54:00] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee consider it a consolation price for the other talents :D
[2:54:00] Intikamcy: nerf inc
[2:54:01] dutrockbridge: Cooldown reduction seems about 5% too high.  :)
[2:54:02] loragheta: report that theres no bug at all
[2:54:02] Cranxjs: that isnt a bug !
[2:54:03] Trekxx: AngelThump
[2:54:08] lumaday: Who read this tooltip before sending lmao
[2:54:15] Zettabyte: "Copium" would be the best report to Blizz, Towel Kappa
[2:54:28] Gezber: "all good" Kappa
[2:54:33] Shaeli: "This is fine..."
[2:54:33] ashnmsr: " It's working " !
[2:54:35] RioosLive: Unfortunate, can't report, let's leave it there.
[2:54:35] Shablagoosh: Oh they got rid of the general abilities and spec specific and just remerged them as 1 in spellbook again
[2:54:40] god_mus: hows he enjoying it?
[2:54:44] falldrgn: talent tree was related.. play as is #nochanges
[2:54:45] Jack_the_Dipper: reprot: 'nothing to see here' Kappa
[2:54:45] SirMouSe: haha - They don't know that though :P
[2:54:46] CloudPants8081: fun detected Kappa
[2:54:54] isseidahk: or really "Guardian instantly comes off of CD while reporting on the bar as '5m'"
[2:54:55] loragheta: REXTROY DETECTED
[2:55:04] mavericks312: working as intended lol
[2:55:07] ObsidianHealer: 100 seconds

[2:55:10] steldam: 50
[2:55:10] xcting: 50 -100
[2:55:15] Niegoss: 100s per holu power spent
[2:55:21] Gezber: 300 per spender
[2:55:21] ashnmsr: it's Each holy power!
[2:55:22] BardtheBowman: 50
[2:55:25] dutrockbridge: Per holy power
[2:55:26] TheItalianStallion321: EVERYONE DISPERSE....nothing to see here lol
[2:55:26] RioosLive: 300 seconds
[2:55:26] Daarksyde: probably should be 1 or 10
[2:55:28] baldpet: each holy power though
[2:55:32] vaddah: each hp spent, so it's 300 seconds
[2:55:32] Shablagoosh: Is it like 50% and 100%?
[2:55:33] RioosLive: It's PER HP spent
[2:55:34] dark_fluxes: by Each Holy Power Sent
[2:55:38] steldam: per holy power spended
[2:55:40] captiv8: you have to do a dungeon with it while you can before they hotfix it, just for shits and giggles
[2:55:40] Gezber: 100/HP = 300s POGGERS
[2:55:52] manmower: supposed to be 1 second
[2:55:56] dark_fluxes: pog
[2:55:56] ashnmsr: does work though!
[2:56:03] mavericks312: doesnt work as intended....works better now lol
[2:56:04] CloudPants8081: atpCap
[2:56:06] misterbreadcrum: It's supposed to be 500 milliseconds, but it looks like it's going straight seconds
[2:56:07] sh1asurprise: Probably supposed to be 100 ms or 1 sec per holy power
[2:56:15] Snabido: 'PS, dont hotfix this, wait until next build'
[2:56:22] isseidahk: still good to report :D
[2:56:30] Dankind64: Nah man, that's working as intended!
[2:56:41] steldam: But but its working exactly as the tooltip says.....
[2:56:47] ShaolinPotato: @the_s0vereign you wouldnt go for FV because on the left side you get the free seraphim proc. the FV side is worthless
[2:56:48] dark_fluxes: by 500 sec!
[2:56:50] ashnmsr: xDDDDDDDDDDDD
[2:56:50] Dankind64: Sounds about right
[2:56:52] Siddydiddydo: sounds good
[2:56:52] ashnmsr: xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[2:56:52] Gezber: @sh1asurprise it's 1 second per HP in shadowlands

[2:57:09] Mecabeast: how's that work with divine toll?
[2:57:09] Raugdel: here we go KEKW
[2:57:10] ashwing_: Dungeon time bois
[2:57:14] Cranxjs: and i though pal would be finally no 1 in tanking :c
[2:57:17] vaddah: the cs swipe moved, it seems like it's working just 1 second and not 1000
[2:57:18] BoldBalls: intended for sure LUL
[2:57:22] addemannen00: that works as intended but its only a typo
[2:57:24] Hexadecimal88: yeh it's reducing
[2:57:25] xcting: this one works,its just tooltip error
[2:57:25] Snabido: It is, I saw it
[2:57:25] isseidahk: 5m is 300sec
[2:57:27] the_sovereign94: @cowb0ycrab really ? FV was op though on shadowlands
[2:57:27] Ooshraxa: it's not moving
[2:57:29] DjStonie: it is... its just only 1 sec each
[2:57:30] Shana27pl: wtf.......
[2:57:31] DjStonie: it works
[2:57:32] xcting: ye its lowering
[2:57:33] zastin586: it is moving
[2:57:40] lord_euphi: it does
[2:57:41] Cranxjs: its reducing it
[2:57:41] steldam: it is
[2:57:43] Se7enthSinn: so Yellow meant Pally, not Fire Mage?
[2:57:44] apollobaker: tbh, this seems like such a lazy implementation
[2:57:46] bukka_hot: wait for blizz to asap fix only the wings bug
[2:57:47] dark_fluxes: it works
[2:57:49] RioosLive: Wait until it gets to seconds
[2:57:50] Torjix: it is
[2:57:52] Kellorian: it works
[2:57:52] Ooshraxa: ah yes, saw it
[2:57:54] ashnmsr: yeah it works , only the tooltip is wrong
[2:57:57] Shana27pl: works..... :/
[2:57:57] Gezber: seems to work
[2:58:00] Mojohusk: This music :O
[2:58:00] zastin586: this one works as intented, not as tooltip states
[2:58:00] falldrgn: Imean  I get its busted, but is that the point of alpha?
[2:58:07] ashnmsr: 4 second for 4 targets?
[2:58:07] dark_fluxes: 1 sec
[2:58:18] rafadotnechi: prob 1 sec
[2:58:21] Cranxjs: saty at aoe dummy
[2:58:22] Odinslayer: talents are so bad man
[2:58:26] Shana27pl: skills... works.....
[2:58:27] Ooshraxa: yep
[2:58:27] Shana27pl: :/
[2:58:36] Sylhepnia: 10 i think
[2:58:39] ashnmsr: that dummy should be the end boss
[2:58:48] ShaolinPotato: @the_s0vereign if you wanted FV, you would lose: FR AND the free Seraphim proc. 100% not worth it
[2:58:49] addemannen00: just erase the 0's from the tooltip
[2:58:49] Kentach: damn doesnt work as the tooltip intended
[2:58:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess the decimal point was borked and it should be 1 second, yeah
[2:58:59] BoezIRL: yes
[2:59:01] NinjaChane: yeah
[2:59:04] Cranxjs: use it at aoe dummys, it will be faster
[2:59:05] Odinslayer: ret talents are so bad
[2:59:06] BoezIRL: you should
[2:59:08] ashnmsr: then make it go down with aoe dummy's
[2:59:11] PigPenLen: yes exactly
[2:59:15] addemannen00: 0,5 and 1 seconds
[2:59:19] Gezber: yep works
[2:59:25] ashnmsr: it's like 2 sec yeah
[2:59:25] BoezIRL: 2 sec
[2:59:28] Ooshraxa: @wEiRdO_dUdE or the dev tool requires it to be in MS, and the UI just doesn't convert it
[2:59:28] xnorthtv: yeah that worked
[2:59:29] srs_business: 3s per?
[2:59:30] NinjaChane: yep
[2:59:30] DjStonie: did they remove the interrupt from shield on purpose or will it be added later?
[2:59:30] apollobaker: even for alpha thats a lazy release
[2:59:32] ashnmsr: 3 sec?
[2:59:32] RioosLive: 2 seconds per hit
[2:59:36] RioosLive: You hit 3 targets
[2:59:37] Gezber: 1+2
[2:59:39] DarkMoonDragons: 1 second per you hit 4 and it went down by 4
[2:59:40] Bassodia: 3
[2:59:41] rainbow_egg: 3
[2:59:44] NinjaChane: 3
[2:59:55] Odinslayer: whats the point of removing the spell from your spell book and put it as a talent wtf is wrong with them
[2:59:56] Strayer_J: is the left side of the holy tree really how it looks on wowhead @Towelliee ?
[2:59:58] Torjix: Can you have that and divine toll?
[2:59:58] ashnmsr: it's 3 second
[3:00:00] zastin586: this one works as intented, not as tooltip states
[3:00:02] RioosLive: About 2-3 seconds, who knows
[3:00:02] manmower: that seems really strong
[3:00:03] Sylhepnia: 3 seconds per target
[3:00:03] dark_fluxes: 3*2 = 10 sec :D
[3:00:09] BardtheBowman: Yea. It’s two additional targets so 3
[3:00:10] srs_business: @Towelliee Legion legendayr
[3:00:17] ashnmsr: using it with divine toll?
[3:00:23] Bassodia: divne toll and its op af
[3:00:24] RioosLive: If you can spec that + divine toll, in big AoE it might be cool
[3:00:26] Shana27pl: skills works... NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:00:33] Shana27pl: hmm
[3:00:39] addemannen00: check with one point
[3:00:43] ashnmsr: it's a good talent imo
[3:00:50] schizowillie: It is a current talent and stacks with Divine toll
[3:01:02] PigPenLen: 1000 is good
[3:01:23] Shana27pl: @Towelliee  DK ? skills ?
[3:01:33] Fawcheddar: hows prot goin
[3:01:37] Knightofgondor123: i thought that talent with the right side of the left side was really good.
[3:01:38] JBonezey: yes DK has skills
[3:01:38] BardtheBowman: How can you just leave that unaccepted quest sitting there?  That would drive me nuts
[3:01:39] Gostaw: 1 point would reduce by 4.5s
[3:01:52] jedai18: !song
[3:01:54] misterbreadcrum: Isn't it a conduit? I know it happens
[3:01:54] Knightofgondor123: with soaring shield i believe
[3:01:58] Mecabeast: could go to SL and become kyrian
[3:01:59] ohnot___her: @Shana27pl You cant expect towelliee to play anything else other than Prot this week lmao

[3:02:26] BardtheBowman: Enemy rebuff
[3:02:27] rainbow_egg: debuff
[3:02:29] rainbow_egg: on enemy
[3:02:30] manmower: debuff on the target
[3:02:30] JBonezey: its a target debuff
[3:02:31] BardtheBowman: Debuff
[3:02:33] ashnmsr: it's on the enemy
[3:02:36] BoezIRL: debuff
[3:02:37] the_hoff_man: AngelThump
[3:02:39] ShaolinPotato: They need to change the Capstone under DT. Instead of CDR it should be Resonance or Ringing Clarity
[3:02:43] Shana27pl: @Shreks14inchUncutHog  ok
[3:02:43] Terminalbandoh: does it say seconds or miliseconds as in MS
[3:03:02] the_sovereign94: I wonder if Mconell wil be pleased about Pala
[3:03:08] Gezber: tooltip said 4%
[3:03:13] JBonezey: Fuck McCuck
[3:03:29] zastin586: it's dropping stacks
[3:03:29] ashnmsr: oh it stacks seperately
[3:03:31] rainbow_egg: they have separate timers
[3:03:34] JBonezey: He's not pleased about anything in life, his only job is to complain
[3:03:58] the_sovereign94: @ptahm0se I mean i want to laugh when he is complaining about it ;P
[3:04:12] federkleid_: federkleid_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:04:13] mavericks312: yea i heard mcconnell had an outburst earlier in graycens chat
[3:04:14] JBonezey: it could be the best tree ever, he would still complain
[3:04:15] theoldgodmd: 9 ads ffs.....
[3:04:23] TreySyd: ikr
[3:04:24] zastin586: report it as bug
[3:04:27] Snabido: Thats a difficult debuff to keep up on ST
[3:04:31] Gezber: wrong debuff icon and value
[3:04:32] ashnmsr: also
[3:04:33] zastin586: dropping stacks must not be intended
[3:04:33] ashnmsr: it should say
[3:04:37] ashnmsr: they stack separately
[3:04:40] manmower: it doesn't say the stacks are reset, would be pretty strong if it was
[3:04:46] Gezber: now you just need to test if it actually reduces dmg KEKW
[3:04:53] JBonezey: he has little to no haste currently, so its going to be hard to keep up
[3:05:01] JBonezey: Paladin always skills out of control with Haste
[3:05:14] theoldgodmd: Being realistic, if I jump back into WoW now and boost a tank how hard is it to get it geared up and running for Mythic+?
[3:05:18] ashnmsr: only 5$ for that talent
[3:05:18] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW

[3:05:21] Shana27pl: @Shreks14inchUncutHog  Druid tank / healer skills?
[3:05:22] Velerio: yyes
[3:05:22] ashnmsr: yes you should
[3:05:26] Feta_Cheez: Hey Towelliee, have you reviewed Retribution as well ?
[3:05:29] ashnmsr: it should say if it drops
[3:05:42] steldam: No, it doesnt says it refresh
[3:05:42] Velerio: has a seperate stack timer on each stack, intended?
[3:05:46] Ethian: Is the lightning on purpouse?
[3:05:48] zastin586: "debuff is not stacking up properly, dropping stacks along the way"
[3:05:56] ashnmsr: It doesn't say if it's separate stacks , or like the tooltip doesn't say if the stacks refreshs the timer or not
[3:05:59] Snabido: Overlap?
[3:06:01] Deadblinx: @Towelliee does avengers shield not silence/interrupt anymore?
[3:06:06] Se7enthSinn: Was it only Pally talents that was added?
[3:06:13] manmower: permanent 15% reduction if it resets em all?
[3:06:17] vaddah: @theoldgodmd pretty easy tbh if you are willing to work your way up with key levels
[3:06:20] SalvationChaos: are there holy talents in the game
[3:06:21] Scoodles91: applying a new stack does not refresh the timer
[3:06:25] RiskyBusines_ez: yea it is - big dmg
[3:06:32] ashnmsr: wait what seriously? no longer interrupts?
[3:06:33] Gezber: KEKW
[3:06:37] RiskyBusines_ez: wtf
[3:06:49] ThaYetii: should just be a passive
[3:06:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: lolwut

[3:06:54] c0mmander_starscream: Thanks Ion

[3:06:56] Aldurik: KEKW
[3:06:57] ObsidianHealer: KEKW
[3:07:01] mavericks312: working as intended
[3:07:05] palatoilet: would the aoe burst from the shield count as "hit by avengers shield"? - if so, 5 target shield + burst + divine toll would be *stupid* with everything that says "hit by avengers shield"
[3:07:09] JBonezey: im shocked they put Paladin in its pretty fucked
[3:07:11] Deadblinx: @ashnmsr the tooltip doesnt say it does anymore
[3:07:11] Shablagoosh: Rogues blunderbuss thing is doing that atm too
[3:07:11] nyx_helios: deleting dk rn
[3:07:11] silodin: `Surprised shock in 3..2..1..

[3:07:33] Carahail: @sic_xx we won't see Holy till next week
[3:07:38] Blvdman: big aoe pull
[3:07:39] charlie_the_snowman: Cheer100  RESPEC !!!
[3:07:42] Blvdman: press moment of glory unkillable
[3:07:42] ThaYetii: yeah that should just straight up be a passive like how it works currently
[3:07:49] sic_xx: lame @carahail
[3:07:52] epiczplz: for aoe tanking that seems tits
[3:07:59] charlie_the_snowman: Cheer100 *RESPECT !

[3:08:28] ThaYetii: dude
[3:08:35] c0mmander_starscream: So the Dungeon is fucked then?
[3:08:37] Deadblinx: Does avengers shield still interrupt/silence?

[3:09:35] JBonezey: Can you lower the cd with anything in the tree?
[3:09:36] Gezber: the debuff applies, but gotta test the numbers
[3:09:39] misterbreadcrum: Eye of Tyr over Divine Toll?
[3:09:41] silodin: 1 minute cd
[3:09:42] Xailen: good to see that ability back
[3:09:44] NinjaChane: just need to delete the truthguard tooltip
[3:09:45] silodin: that is insane
[3:09:46] Shana27pl: hmm
[3:09:49] federkleid_: @ThaYetii i was able to get 2 capstones on wowhead
[3:09:56] BardtheBowman: So just a tooltip wording error
[3:10:01] addemannen00: still says artifact lol
[3:10:02] manmower: can it stack with that 15% stacking debuff you had?
[3:10:03] Shamwise: I dont know what you just said lil kid , but you touched my heart
[3:10:03] Velerio: i will definitively spec into both truthguard and divine toll; don't matter how good the other abilities are!
[3:10:06] Lothawia: @misterbreadcrum DT is bad without ring of clarity
[3:10:10] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee ... the debuff LOOKS like it works. Maybe test on dummy if it's damage is actually reduced by 25%?
[3:10:12] Shana27pl: Eye of Tyr  no no :/
[3:10:22] JBonezey: Truthguard and DT all day
[3:10:22] Shana27pl: skills... :/
[3:10:29] misterbreadcrum: @Lothawia Is that the conduit?
[3:10:41] Lothawia: @misterbreadcrum Yeah
[3:10:48] schnaperry: do you think in general we will have more abilitys to play with on each classes or more or less the same number?
[3:10:51] ashnmsr: @Towelliee doesn't it annoy you to see same icon's on abilities and other stuff? please ask them to hire 1 person to make new icons...
[3:11:17] Snabido: umad LUL
[3:11:18] Heracy: morning all!
[3:11:30] silodin: Why would it need new icons? they are the same abilities

[3:11:37] generaljosh721: New icons just make it harder to remember what buttons do what lol it changes nothing else
[3:11:42] NinjaChane: yeah
[3:11:52] ashnmsr: @silodin not these , i mean other abilities for example you see on warrior
[3:12:10] Barfuu: @Lothawia i wont agree... dt is bad without silence on avengers shield... thats what i would say
[3:12:14] ashnmsr: Not those towelliee i mean overall like in warrior you can see so many of the same icons
[3:12:14] stabzmcgeee: ok but what about th ehunt dh icon being in rouge tree
[3:12:22] addemannen00: they changed the brewmaster artifact icon.. sadge
[3:12:23] manmower: isn't Tyr the dead dude in DF?
[3:12:28] Ooshraxa: they could do HD updates
[3:12:40] smol_gunner: how does this even get pushed? seems like they didnt test jack shit
[3:12:41] RiskyBusines_ez: @manmower no
[3:12:48] cravo: Is a cool old icon but that icon makes literally 0 sense now.
[3:12:50] vaddah: @Lothawia the strongest part of dt was getting 5 hp in aoe packs, we lost that too :\
[3:13:03] RiskyBusines_ez: @manmower Tyr died in Tirisfal - therefore Tyrs' fall = Tirisfal
[3:13:07] silodin: so avenger's shield doesn't actually sillence anymore?
[3:13:07] manmower: @RiskyBusines_ez is Tyrhold not related?
[3:13:09] silodin: Scammed
[3:13:17] thebakeriscomingforu: Yeah I think Tyr was one of the last titan constructs we didn't know the whereabouts of.
[3:13:21] RiskyBusines_ez: @manmower its just named after him, but it wasnt the dude we saw
[3:13:29] Jack_the_Dipper: @smoltankz It's alpha and stuff can always break in it or mistakes to be made
[3:13:29] Barfuu: @silodin nope, it doesnt
[3:13:31] Mecabeast: atleast prot is working better than holy kekw
[3:13:46] Lothawia: @vaddah Oh so its only primary target now?
[3:13:57] manmower: Keeper Tyr built Tyrhold it says
[3:13:59] TheVigiliance: Consecration is getting so many talents
[3:14:10] NinjaChane: seems right
[3:14:10] ShaolinPotato: ret works its just a bad tree
[3:14:14] vaddah: @Lothawia no, AS just doesn't give hp anymore period
[3:14:19] Snabido: Tyr's ass is underneath Tirisfal unless they decide he aint
[3:14:33] manmower: there is a Keeper named Tyr as well
[3:14:48] Barfuu: @Lothawia in my opiniont (m+ related) the strongest part was the aoe silence
[3:15:04] Lothawia: true
[3:15:04] Gezber: KEKW

[3:15:47] Gezber: nope
[3:15:49] Nerendis: I mean I wanna see it.
[3:15:49] vaddah: @Ssrlord last season of an expansion is usually the more fun (toghether with the beginning)
[3:15:51] manmower: judgment of light
[3:15:54] Kosen_: @Ssrlord People ask this every time an expansion is queued for release, if you've never played, you'd be better waiting until it releases.
[3:15:54] Aussems: Press the button and you'll see it Kappa
[3:15:56] HaloS23: @Towelliee My Left Arm for a DPS meter right now!!!!!
[3:16:03] Mallaes: Time to macro it into every abilities lol
[3:16:12] NinjaChane: not there
[3:16:13] RiskyBusines_ez: @manmower Tyr was an ancient Titan keeper - the ones we see in the cinematic are watchers
[3:16:14] Aussems: There it is PogChamp
[3:16:18] generaljosh721: Bind it to mousewheel and see how fast it can go LUL
[3:16:20] BardtheBowman: It would hit other enemies or heal you
[3:16:23] xcting: it didn't trigger a gcd, so bind it to all you spells @Towelliee
[3:16:34] Kosen_: Would they have added the buttons for testing purposes?
[3:16:37] manmower: so Tyr built Tyrhold, same dude as the Tirisfall Tyr right?
[3:16:38] looney199725: bruh the pala and mage devs having mental breakdown rn
[3:16:40] net_mi: no gcd = broken
[3:16:44] Myrror: make a multi line macro that just multicasts touch of light since it doesn't have gcd or cd at all bam top damage on every fight
[3:16:47] KiingOdin: "touch of light no worky"
[3:16:52] Barfuu: @Ssrlord yeah, you have so much stuff to do (questlines etc.) it'll be pretty overwhelming for you i guess
[3:16:52] Lazermage23: No GCD
[3:16:54] Gezber: LUL
[3:17:10] Siddydiddydo: you have too much wfaith

[3:17:22] silodin: Get a timer out
[3:17:24] Norbi33: another one!
[3:17:29] Lorilath: it doesn't work for ret and crusade atm
[3:17:34] Cranxjs: @mavericks312 PogChamp
[3:17:35] RiskyBusines_ez: @manmower Yes exactly. Tyr died fighting Lokens minions in the area which is now known as Tirisfal Glades (Tyr's fall = Tirisfal)
[3:17:36] Templexx: hows the tree so far?
[3:17:37] 91Niki: Hello friends sacWAVE
[3:17:39] Odinslayer: for real? aint it already 2 min's in live with no passives or talents to make it 2 min? why they made it 3 min and add a talent to make it as it is now
[3:17:40] Snabido: Have you tested pvp talents in conjunction with the borked stuff 😏
[3:17:52] RiskyBusines_ez: @manmower His tomb is under the lake, part of the pala artifact quest
[3:17:57] Kakotan2143: @Templexx broke he says lol
[3:18:12] 91Niki: Nice
[3:18:13] GreenLizzardx: does it work to play prot healer now ? if you spec around holy power refgen and all the glory talents ?
[3:18:17] ShaolinPotato: ret is a garbo tree
[3:18:18] Lorilath: 27
[3:18:22] NinjaChane: 27
[3:18:26] serixis: is it hard to keep up SOTR now?

[3:19:18] KiingOdin: "Aspirations of divinity no worky"
[3:19:31] Luxicake: is this the most buggy tree thus far?
[3:19:36] xcting: a few mistakes can happen, but there are only a few things working omfg
[3:19:44] thenormalbeast: So many bugs, this is one tree of many left. No such time to release, pray big
[3:20:08] NinjaChane: yeah
[3:20:23] NinjaChane: if you lose crusader strike makes sense you get it with hotr
[3:20:23] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[3:20:40] Gezber: all 3 are the same again NotLikeThis
[3:20:42] ashnmsr: should be 15%
[3:21:09] Odinslayer: @xcting again its alpha O_O
[3:21:10] Gezber: is it going to be 15% or 5% to reduce by 3
[3:21:11] KiingOdin: :Blizz: You only get 5% what do you want?
[3:22:04] Lancasterbomber2000: Can you put talents into all three specs or just 1 at a time?
[3:22:09] looney199725: welp now we know
[3:22:18] xcting: @Odinslayer i get its alpha, but did they even read the tree, or someone finished this tree the second before release
[3:22:27] Gezber: @Lancasterbomber2000 one at a time
[3:22:32] Cntrl11120: Name is wrong, and its not stacking %
[3:23:03] JazzyJay2136: magisters of judgement
[3:23:04] DramaticTv: judgement
[3:23:09] Cntrl11120: OH AND its not reducing the holy power by +1 per talent
[3:23:10] D4LB3RK: the devs will know
[3:23:11] Lostdogal: just put that
[3:23:20] yakisy: song?
[3:23:20] Kisswani: Howdy towHi
[3:23:22] Odinslayer: @xcting thats why we test it and give feedback that its garbage so they fix it, devs will know
[3:23:29] Lothawia: Should be Seal of Clarity but buff is magisters of judgement
[3:23:32] BayBeeBroBear: @Towelliee  im baked, love you dude.

[3:23:52] silodin: what is wrong with dusk and dawn?
[3:24:04] yakisy: whats the song called @Towelliee ?
[3:24:12] BardtheBowman: Test it.  Be complete
[3:24:27] vicktorol: @yakisy nightsong
[3:24:28] Odinslayer: @yakisy i think its the nelf ost
[3:24:36] yakisy: @vicktorol thanks
[3:24:38] pphands69: No
[3:24:38] ShaolinPotato: not at all
[3:24:38] mrmanno14: nope
[3:24:42] NinjaChane: of course that one works, lol
[3:24:47] majorpipoo: ITS A no brainer tbh
[3:24:49] RathianD: I hated it in torghast
[3:24:50] Gezber: it's pretty boring. get a passive every now and then ResidentSleeper
[3:24:52] Adventw0lf: Yo anyone able to enlighten me on the current state of spriest on live?
[3:24:57] Cranxjs: well with talent below its like wrath, 16% more dmg
[3:24:58] Cntrl11120: its a passive for 1 point but on pull you have nothing
[3:25:00] yungsquillium: seems clunky
[3:25:01] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee easy passive, don't have to do anything. For new players?
[3:25:03] Cntrl11120: so its not worth really.
[3:25:07] Cranxjs: and uptime is nearly all the time
[3:25:07] Odinslayer: @Cranxjs bad
[3:25:15] Daarksyde: decent for holy
[3:25:24] CrsAlpha: As an Hpal im freaking out
[3:25:28] thebakeriscomingforu: the talent flow seems off in the prot tree
[3:25:38] CrsAlpha: Hpal getting kick
[3:25:41] Chopsor: couldnt that be good with high haste tho ?
[3:25:42] EscapePlan01: whats the big complaints with Pally so far?
[3:25:46] net_mi: good in pvp as well
[3:26:01] thebakeriscomingforu: to silo'd and abilities are all over the place
[3:26:08] majorpipoo: @Towelliee can you chekc pvp talent also pls ?
[3:26:11] fcsgamer: Dont worry, guides will tell you where to go :)
[3:26:15] Odinslayer: ret is so bad and i cant believe i'd say this but current talents are way better lol
[3:26:23] Feta_Cheez: for retribution I think the class tree is much smoother and easier to figure out
[3:26:27] xRezzylol: I was really hoping the talent from Wrath called Conviction returned to this tree but… nope
[3:26:27] Cntrl11120: use word of glory to test armor
[3:26:30] isseidahk: it increased it to 3k
[3:26:36] isseidahk: for like 2s
[3:26:39] tornbraclet: blizzard took a page out of bethesda's book and saying working as intended
[3:26:40] vulkankragon: just got a news that the microsoft activision blizzard acquisition is getting blocked by US federal trade commision. chance of the acquisition is getting slimier by the day.
[3:26:49] Daarksyde: they will probably revamp the paladin tree because the passives are OP for holy
[3:26:53] Gezber: doesn't work, ye
[3:26:57] Cntrl11120: use word of glory to spend holy power to test armor increase
[3:27:03] Feta_Cheez: @Odinslayer that is a stretch, to call them way better
[3:27:04] isseidahk: oh, my internet cut off lol. so i missed most of that test :P
[3:27:26] Fawcheddar: you gotta pay for the battle pass to unlock your abilities
[3:27:27] thenormalbeast: They started before Shadowlands :D
[3:27:36] Shablagoosh: that immortal joke caught me off guard KEKW
[3:27:41] thebakeriscomingforu: I'd have preferred just the mage trees this week and paladin come out later. Since its not complete and not working
[3:27:45] Nerendis: Prot pal working as intended towCopium towCopium towCopium
[3:27:59] yungsquillium: divine protection?
[3:28:06] stabzmcgeee: i feel like they rushed pally trees out because everyone was scream,ing for more tankjs
[3:28:07] Ribastur0075: Mad Paragon Maybe only for ret
[3:28:08] yungsquillium: ohh there we are
[3:28:12] Gezber: yeah, it was Ardent in SL
[3:28:56] Shablagoosh: 2 min bubble in pvp"
[3:28:57] Shablagoosh: ?
[3:29:00] Feta_Cheez: @stabzmcgeee trust me, paladin trees are in a better state than mage. mage trees are trash
[3:29:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah a short bubble CD would help them in PvP
[3:29:19] Gezber: KEKW
[3:29:24] Lothawia: KEKW

[3:29:32] apollobaker: this shit is so lazy holy fuck
[3:29:35] Siddydiddydo: I see the problem, aint got no gas in it
[3:29:39] Daarksyde: because they got lazy and put BoP lol
[3:29:41] Goomiie_: Probably cause it says BoP instead of spelling it out
[3:29:43] stabzmcgeee: @Feta_Cheez oh man really,,, hadnt looked at mage trees yet, was still hopium
[3:29:43] Lothawia: prob cos they have it as "BoP" and not the full name
[3:29:46] geokouts: 1.2k dps on TW WoD dungeon is it good?
[3:30:05] NinjaChane: yeah it is funny that it is wrote as BoP
[3:30:07] Feta_Cheez: @mavericks312 frost tree is the only one that kind of works, but is still subpar
[3:30:26] GreenLizzardx: what spells pala have as prot before talents
[3:30:31] TheItalianStallion321: i feel like 10% of what hes tested....has worked lol MAYBE 20%

[3:30:44] dark_fluxes: How many bugs do you have reported so far?
[3:30:45] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee in QA, this is pretty common. I've seen many many busted build where it looks like the developer has done no internal testing at all.
[3:30:47] dyslexican1: lol this is amazing.
[3:30:47] looney199725: welp
[3:30:48] Daarksyde: time to main change

[3:30:58] thebakeriscomingforu: do the mage trees work? lol
[3:30:59] YardRage: I'm not crying you're crying
[3:31:00] dyslexican1: I cant beliave they even bothered to put this out even on alpha
[3:31:01] Daarksyde: towCry towCry towCry
[3:31:02] TheItalianStallion321: @dark_fluxes i think almost every single fuckin thing lmao
[3:31:03] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee it's absurd
[3:31:05] manmower: spell warding gives BoP? so spellwarding gets the benefit of the 60s BoP reduction
[3:31:08] isseidahk: i wanna see mage now lol
[3:31:09] nvnto: KEKW
[3:31:10] llNoTToXiCll: hes tyring up guys

[3:31:20] NinjaChane: dude it is really insane that they released it like this.
[3:31:21] EscapePlan01: thios is great feedback tho Towelliee and its good its coming from you
[3:31:22] Carahail: towCry towCry towCry towF
[3:31:23] Gezber: "will be ready for 2022 release" Kappa
[3:31:23] Feta_Cheez: @isseidahk dont KEKW
[3:31:24] Scarhearth: Mage one is garbage as well
[3:31:25] Myrror: based on this experience I'm excited for monk Kappa
[3:31:25] Jack_the_Dipper: Is that a good thing? Kappa
[3:31:25] xcting: wow thnx for saying it
[3:31:29] Lostdogal: they're taking the piss lol. They just fired this out their ass knowing it was garbage, they're wasting your time getting you to report any of this.
[3:31:29] manmower: they sacrificed warrior talents for this
[3:31:31] TheItalianStallion321: i hope someone from Blizzard is watching right now lol
[3:31:32] Jalapinot: @NoTToXiCLuL KEKW Good one

[3:31:37] Feta_Cheez: @Towelliee mage is worse KEKW
[3:31:39] dark_fluxes: REPORT PALADIN
[3:31:42] Dystilled: Feels like they were trying to cater to players demands for more classes and just pushed it as is
[3:31:45] dark_fluxes: :D
[3:31:46] Ertra: wait you can only have spellwarding OR bop?  not both?!?
[3:31:49] vaddah: I know it makes it impossible to test anything, but at least gets the conversation moving on the ideas of the talent tree
[3:31:55] Sollice: Is he talking about the broken tree? Has he tried dragon flying in the new zone?
[3:31:56] Wolfenhoof: i read that one person is doing the trees and thought it is a joke, but maybe it isn't Kappa
[3:32:00] llNoTToXiCll: @Jalapinot @isseidahk  /bow
[3:32:00] TheItalianStallion321: @Ertra either or cant have both
[3:32:07] dyslexican1: " here are some buttons" Most don;t work at all.. others cast other abilities!! have fun!"
[3:32:11] EscapePlan01: yeh this is like the first outrage ive seen other than mage, hopefully they listen
[3:32:11] manmower: people just wanted to see the trees so they could give feedback
[3:32:13] Gezber: that's good, if it works
[3:32:15] silodin: TBC abilities
[3:32:27] NinjaChane: they were like we can drop Ret and Prot, but Holy is broke. Better not release that yet.
[3:32:27] Zippaya: if it works :D
[3:32:28] Siddydiddydo: I wonder if that works for other pallies
[3:32:29] Halgrender: But it takes 3 points
[3:32:32] Siddydiddydo: so if  only 1 of you have to take it
[3:32:32] llNoTToXiCll: its alsmot as they want players to test them rather than themselves
[3:32:34] nothumbgamer_ttv: HUGE
[3:32:34] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee fun part is going to create an actual working tank build in this state
[3:32:36] llNoTToXiCll: almost*
[3:32:41] stabzmcgeee: i mean plus side,, atleast there is something to give feedback on unlike DH/monk etc sadge
[3:32:46] Gezber: does it share stacks with other paladins tho?
[3:32:49] TheItalianStallion321: @Sollice Max D/C'ed like 100 times last night doing Dragon Riding lol
[3:32:49] pigzip: @towelliee  we should have know when they did not  release holy tree
[3:32:59] Ertra: consecrate is holy... should work
[3:33:02] Sollice: @Sollice Yeah I saw thats why I am wondering if Towelliee knows lol
[3:33:21] isseidahk: id help but uhh no alpha :P
[3:33:23] Daarksyde: it says "attacks"
[3:33:25] legend449: did they debuff say 5% instead of 15%??
[3:33:29] Aus211: I think it only said 5% and not 15%
[3:33:33] TheItalianStallion321: @Sollice maybe he shouldnt find out after this debacle lol
[3:33:33] Bigvont: I don't like how they butchered Avenger's Shield :-(
[3:33:37] Siddydiddydo: 20 pally raid, 100% damage increase lol
[3:33:41] shadowcaelic: @Towelliee shouldnt it be 15% on target ?
[3:33:41] Halgrender: In Ret tree, they are doing everything to make Consecrate be part of your rotation
[3:33:46] Argabad: it's only 5% not 15% debuff on the dummy
[3:33:49] PidiaP: PidiaP subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[3:33:52] Lorilath: the debuff tooltip only said 5%
[3:33:53] Daarksyde: it said 15% first time and then it said 5% after that when it reaplied
[3:33:54] nothumbgamer_ttv: debuff says 5%
[3:33:57] JellonaCub: wasnt it 5% not 15%?

[3:34:01] manmower: helps out disc priests
[3:34:06] Sam_ee_: @Towelliee debuff tooltip is bugged, says 5% should be 15%
[3:34:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Priests can put up some holy dam
[3:34:13] Pannekaker: @Bigvont What did they do?

[3:35:11] isseidahk: oh im not cool enough :P
[3:35:12] Ooshraxa: @NoTToXiCLuL really odd - seems like they they did no internal QA. Would have caught the most horrible stuff in less than a day.
[3:35:17] Pannekaker: Oh that's fucked up

[3:35:32] Ralykx: Like HOLY shit I would say
[3:35:35] Rictamar: and they didn't want to release just one tree
[3:35:36] Brodih_: is Holycow in the chat?
[3:35:48] llNoTToXiCll: @Ooshraxa  Talking out stuff helps  : /
[3:35:49] TheItalianStallion321: CALLING ALL ALPHA PALADINS
[3:35:51] Maldor313: if prot looks like that they have not touch holy then LUL
[3:35:57] Chopsor: wait its only a chance ? KEKW
[3:36:00] Rictamar: @TheItalianStallion321 pretty sure on twitter they said its unintentional
[3:36:01] Daarksyde: maybe check your settings for your target. it might be only showing your debuffs
[3:36:03] tornbraclet: does it have a internal cooldown?
[3:36:03] dark_fluxes: xD
[3:36:04] Wolfenhoof: I hope so. But hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.
[3:36:09] Halgrender: No debuffs so far
[3:36:10] Gezber: wtf monkaS
[3:36:12] Daarksyde: check settings
[3:36:13] Zippaya: aaaaaaaaand its broken now
[3:36:18] Argabad: so multiple pallys make it impossible to get the debuff KEKW
[3:36:22] Daarksyde: might only show debuffs from you
[3:36:24] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee internal CD?
[3:36:27] ashnmsr: You stop hitting
[3:36:27] Cranxjs: i think it will proc from autohits
[3:36:31] ashnmsr: and see if it works with holy cow
[3:36:36] Feta_Cheez: what a great proc chance KEKW
[3:36:43] ashnmsr: just stop hitting and see his works for you
[3:36:45] Cranxjs: maybe stay back? and look at debuffs
[3:36:48] SuperHaxx: according to wowhead talents its a 3ppm so it seems kinda meh?
[3:36:54] Frantzen13: if u stop hitting and see if u see his buff
[3:36:57] captiv8: Might be good with higher haste.
[3:36:58] masenka_: more paladins = more uptime thats the quiestion
[3:36:59] Halgrender: I mean, it's a 3 point talent. Most of 3-pointers are bad.
[3:37:01] dark_fluxes: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:37:18] Wolfenhoof: at least those two punching tauren are a splendid thing to look at

[3:37:54] masenka_: it will still be OP if the uptime is really high with multiple paladins
[3:38:18] Cranxjs: would be a fun raid to see only pal and priest in it ;D
[3:38:30] Odinslayer: do i seriously have to spend a point to get rebuke?
[3:38:46] Halgrender: Chat, your opinions about Mage trees? Did you like it?
[3:38:50] isseidahk: maybe the target dummy is bugged :P
[3:38:59] Daarksyde: @Odinslayer thats for every class/spec. You have to talent into an interupt
[3:39:00] SkyIsBunny: Cheer100 Cheer100  are you doing another marathon for release
[3:39:03] SuperHaxx: @masenka_ well with 3 ppm and that it refreshed the timer back to 5 sec each procc you would need alot of paladins starting at diffrent times to keep a high uptime
[3:39:06] llNoTToXiCll: i'm guessing they were thinking people wouldnt have to many palis in the group to take advantage of that debuff but thats just thoughts
[3:39:09] Chopsor: i feels like with 3 its not worth it. its 3 points
[3:39:11] Gezber: @Odinslayer every class so far has to spend a talent point for interrupt
[3:39:14] Zippaya: how many bugs you reported so far for talents
[3:39:19] Lothawia: @Odinslayer Nah save the point go without rebuke let others deal with it lol
[3:39:36] strchsr: @Towelliee Tooltip bug maybe? Or is it actually only 5%?
[3:39:57] Halgrender: Should be 15% for 5 sec.
[3:39:57] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:40:08] endakenny: no
[3:40:09] Odinslayer: no i mean its a base spell why would they make it into a talent lol, are they really out of ideas to put as talents they have to put base spells from spell books in this tree? its so stupid
[3:40:11] zastin586: only hammer
[3:40:13] Daarksyde: no, its just hammer
[3:40:14] LongSnapper99: Thought it was only HoW
[3:40:16] ashnmsr: No but it's 1 second i think
[3:40:17] endakenny: only hammer
[3:40:18] Daarksyde: so OP now
[3:40:31] Siddydiddydo: 30% just hammer, 1 second
[3:40:46] Rictamar: @Odinslayer they've made everyone's utility including kicks into talents, its the way they decided to go
[3:40:48] Daarksyde: imagine with Ret and Divine toll...
[3:40:50] Lazermage23: Just Hammer on Live
[3:40:54] LongSnapper99: So no more Ashen Hollow right?
[3:40:55] DirtyBeef2134: Did you figure out if shield doesn't interrupt? or if bug?
[3:41:10] Mikmat87: spec in op talent and you dont have to wait for cd..
[3:41:15] Odinslayer: @Gylduran was it that way before mop revamp?

[3:50:04] Daarksyde: time for Ret, your reporting game is strong

[3:58:11] Halgrender: Crap
[3:58:31] amricatt: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:58:47] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee Paladin devs need a Kyler Murray-like clause in their contract to play the dev alpha at least 4 hours per week before submitting trees...
[3:58:50] InDoddWeTrust: i can't believe you have to spec into interrupt.  more excuses for dps who refuse to interrupt anything PauseChamp

[3:59:25] Nerendis: 120 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:59:34] Ooshraxa: @InDoddWeTrust never understood why they didn't give all interrupts the same treatment at DH interrupts
[3:59:36] Halgrender: QQ: We will be able to have different talent trees saved? So for example, before starting a dungeon, i can just change to a specific talent tree?
[4:00:17] Alastree: Hey Towelliee
[4:00:17] silodin: @Halgrender Yes
[4:00:18] Pachydactyl: Yrel music from HotS Kreygasm

[4:00:44] Thajgunz: will light give alot threat?
[4:00:52] DeanoTV: @Towelliee save the talents then relog just incase
[4:00:59] Halgrender: Didn't see that. Cool feature.
[4:01:05] PigPenLen: NotLikeThis
[4:01:26] Halgrender: Because i think talent trees, at least for some specs, could change a lot based on the dungeon or content that your are doing.
[4:01:37] agentblaster123: What does the last talent you took do ? The one that looks like shield from artifact weapons
[4:01:47] Siddydiddydo: ewait, we dont have cleanse anymore?

[4:03:09] RiskyBusines_ez: @OfficialGameSlayer i guess bartender
[4:03:12] Siddydiddydo: man, all these people are just going to skip getting an interrupt "sorry cant interrupt" *raid dies*
[4:03:24] warrenny: Horse is auto pick
[4:03:52] teodorlrp: I keep hearing that people complain about certain spells that you have to put points in talents to have an effect, but judgment, basic don't give you holy power, if you level up get the holy power passive, isn't it the same thing?
[4:03:55] Wcvechten: I'm really excited for the zone and the new dungeon
[4:04:13] nimshot: Yeah, Steed isnt a choice really as its mandatory for wings/etc "path"

[4:12:55] Kayotics: Does it say on tool tip it generates holy power?
[4:13:04] manmower: maybe make the silence an extra talent or remove it completely, no reason to need a ranged aoe silence

[4:18:13] Brodih_: @twymanos da
[4:18:14] Sollice: @91Niki Such a heartless mod. I see your denial on that unban request. That person clearly had many intelligent things to share with the chat. His logs are amazing

[4:38:41] manmower: takes years of lifting to get that big, you've been stuck in stasis
[4:38:44] 91Niki: Huh, yeah they do look cooler lol
[4:38:45] Scratchem76: give that blue pill LOL
[4:38:49] haalxd: Simple, that will be the tank form
[4:38:55] Big_Wanshan: looks like theyve added detail to the toons
[4:38:59] eatonaround: is the dot he keeps getting a bug?
[4:39:04] eatonaround: the green poison stuff
[4:39:07] Deadelus0: damn :o
[4:39:13] NA_Mus: @Towelliee  why do you get a debuff that randomly poisons you? Is it a bug?
[4:39:13] KushDaddy03: @haalxd don't get my hopes up like that
[4:39:15] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee We will TRY to get from one side to the other via dragonriding...
[4:39:18] atrexy_: he said dragonid not dragonoid ? bug maybe ?
[4:39:24] Cakeabsorber: aw shiiiit they released pally trees! Just saw the news the talents and knew where to tune in PogChamp
[4:39:35] raldrik: The paladin tree looks awesome.
[4:39:39] Lythoraxx: 10 min was like flying in wow classic from uc to blackrock
[4:39:43] Theliahh: @atrexy_ the actual word is Drakonid not Drakonoid
[4:39:49] Ooshraxa: yeah, about that....
[4:39:49] Snabido: Trees were a shitshow
[4:39:55] lightslegend: how's it feel having the legion artifact ability back? @Towelliee
[4:40:03] Cakeabsorber: They dont work? Sadge
[4:40:12] atrexy_: @Theliahh ohh okay thank you
[4:40:12] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:40:17] raldrik: wait you want it to work? Details this is a small indie company
[4:40:18] Big_Wanshan: blizzard style they will release the game then hot fix everything for a month lol
[4:40:22] Fuwafuwa_Guru: towelliee eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party eventi1Party
[4:40:45] KushDaddy03: like nyi dont work or say they work but dont lmao
[4:40:47] DeanoTV: chat this is alpha calm LUL
[4:40:51] Theliahh: please give holy back back to AS :(
[4:40:56] Theliahh: holy power *
[4:41:03] manmower: i think they're trying to keep with the schedule
[4:41:09] Cakeabsorber: Have you tried ret yet?
[4:41:13] RiptoreCA: Median Income in the UK is 39,000 $ and in US is 30k right now
[4:41:14] apollobaker: this release just seems so god damn lazy
[4:41:14] Dystilled: The non-working talents should have at least been marked with NYI or something similar
[4:41:22] Big_Wanshan: they need to start paying Alpha players for devolpment
[4:41:24] jclester: Cant test broken stuff
[4:41:27] manmower: they'll probably fix it fairly quickly
[4:41:29] Winthernight: It is really good that it launched. Because they need a shit ton of feedback. Because it is far from done
[4:41:32] strike879: maybe they released a wrong version
[4:41:39] ghost186_: Are the mage talents working?
[4:41:54] Theliahh: they decided not to release Holy because it wasnt done, surprised they didnt do the same for prot
[4:41:54] OviTheGray: to be fair, you asked for paladin talents nor for working paladin talents LUL
[4:41:58] apollobaker: @Towelliee why would they release it in such a state?
[4:42:01] visaeris412: is this the type of stuff thats gonna keep DF from launching this year?
[4:42:04] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee  Dragon riding seems extra bugged this build as well alot of DCing happening
[4:42:06] Mecabeast: this is the most rework of classes since what legion?
[4:42:07] Ooshraxa: @strike879 that is highly unlikely. Version control is very very tight on large projects like that.
[4:42:16] Adirtan: @bobbybakerr coz its alpha? :)
[4:42:19] Big_Wanshan: as long as holy and ret are good lol
[4:42:38] akafrosty4: is this new UI?
[4:42:42] 91Niki: @bobbybakerr That's why it's called alpha. It's to release things so people testing it can find bugs.
[4:42:44] atrexy_: is there a new skill in dragon riding ?
[4:42:45] Big_Wanshan: lol
[4:42:46] Darthyrevan: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[4:42:46] apollobaker: @Adirtan this isnt alpha level, its not something you roll out to the public, this is like inhouse testing state
[4:42:53] bonkyouded: just switch over to ret :)
[4:42:57] mavericks312: towelliee gonna end up on the brew anyway so lol
[4:42:58] Inthezonewow: Aspect Power phase 4 for sure towCopium towCopium towCopium
[4:43:01] YardRage: we don't need tanks anyway Kappa
[4:43:05] T0MMYT: pepeMeltdown
[4:43:07] Kwurky: I'm just happy paladin wasn't one of the last classes to get tested. Feels like that's been the norm for previous expansions.
[4:43:13] Big_Wanshan: we have bears and warriors for that LUL
[4:43:13] BigCraigs: TFW no long arm of the law
[4:43:24] atrexy_: did you play the new dungeon already ?
[4:43:25] Adirtan: to be honest some ret talents/spells look pretty sick
[4:43:27] eaglerydr: They should have done some internal testing before now. Understand alpha still It is not a good start for paladins.
[4:43:40] raldrik: I am leveling my bear right now just to play disco bear tank
[4:43:43] Scoodles91: just go bear, problem solved :D
[4:43:43] Darthyrevan: Where warrior towCopium
[4:43:44] Snabido: @bobbybakerr If its public, why dont I have access to it 😏
[4:43:44] KushDaddy03: but thrash spam so boring
[4:43:49] agentblaster123: Except the mobility, are DK alright right now ?
[4:43:51] Big_Wanshan: Love healing a good bear tank EZ
[4:43:52] Wcvechten: Warriors and DHs? Removed from reality
[4:43:54] mekatok: that hunter has a snail pet
[4:43:57] kingliar: judt waiting on brewmaster
[4:44:06] xcting: i heard enhancement shamans are best tanks @ the moment
[4:44:08] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:44:12] manmower: paladin with these broken talents is basically just a prot warrior
[4:44:30] apollobaker: dont want to know how the other classes look if this is the one they release LOL
[4:44:33] Halgrender: @xcting Best trees so far, imo.
[4:44:36] Rakim88: do u feel pally tree has too much bloat? i feel that is the issue with alot of classes so far.
[4:45:12] eaglerydr: Sad that there seems to be more attention for Druid’s tank spec.
[4:45:13] Ooshraxa: @eaglerydr not uncommon in QA, just usually not this severe. I've tested a lot of stuff where I went: "Did anyone even TRY pressing this button before me?"
[4:45:13] Adirtan: i mean lets be honest, hpala is getting Rebuke, its insta meta for M+ :D
[4:45:25] Halgrender: Ret looking for AoE tho
[4:45:27] bonkyouded: i like how avenging wrath can be turned into a defensive finally
[4:45:28] xcting: @Halgrender ye it so imo aswell, but heard max say they are unkillable for now
[4:45:30] raye_gaming22: bold take to asume paladin will be vaible in M+ kekw
[4:45:35] manmower: i feel like if avenger shield interrupts it will automatically make the other builds pointless
[4:45:38] 91Niki: @bobbybakerr Not to mention, things can work as they should on internal testing, but once you push it out on a build that's accessible to the public, shit can break
[4:45:39] Big_Wanshan: internet has been so weird
[4:45:41] MrHI6HWAY: yuge
[4:45:41] Sanctana827: @Adirtan I can't wait for rebuke as holy
[4:45:41] thenormalbeast: They are
[4:45:47] Rakim88: yes kalamazi has getting lag yesterday too
[4:46:01] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee Max had massive DCs while testing dragonflight in this zone yesterday
[4:46:01] atrexy_: yeah but the hpala is so boring, that you need too be inranged en upclose. like the wotlk hpala more
[4:46:07] manmower: 8x sampling
[4:46:07] Asithious: hows it lookin for pallys in Dragon?
[4:46:11] Adirtan: @chizu_gaming they always been, just ppl tend to min max 3% for 15keys for no reason
[4:46:11] ashnmsr: FAAA EYYYY
[4:46:29] Halgrender: @Asithious Bugged so far. Cant really say
[4:46:40] Asithious: rip
[4:46:42] Adirtan: @atrexy_ for you its boring, i personaly lobe that gameplay :)
[4:46:49] Alienfromger: RTX ON
[4:46:51] Asithious: tryin to figure out if i wanna run my shammy, or pally lol
[4:46:53] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee relog or reload? Make sure your talents and bars don't go poof?
[4:47:08] Rakim88: ray tracing is big ole FPS hog no way
[4:47:31] atrexy_: @Adirtan yeah ofc it's personal right but they should make it that you can choose, like if i wanne heal from a far i can
[4:47:32] Asithious: Anyone here play horde, and bored currently? lol
[4:47:40] BoezIRL: wait are you getting quest from alliance npc?
[4:47:56] BoezIRL: cool
[4:48:14] Adirtan: @atrexy_ i  mean yea i agree with you :) but lets face it, rest of the healers is range, i kinda get why blizz goes that way :)
[4:48:21] Towelliee: !yt
[4:48:22] 91Niki: People truly don't get how complicated coding and game development can be. Everything can work just as you want it on internal testing. Then the moment you push it out on the server, random shit breaks

[4:48:41] Sambhur: How far in the future from Shadowlands is Dragonflight?
[4:48:46] Sollice: RTX, in WoW's implementation is pointless

[4:54:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: putuTIME Silverhand
[4:54:54] 91Niki: The fact that people think devs knowingly pushes broken system onto the alpha is kinda funny to me LUL Like "man look how everything just doesn't work as intended... fuck it lets just press the button anyway". That ain't how it works lol
[4:55:00] kaihole: I only leveled to 70 in TBC because I thought I would be able to transfer over :(
[4:55:59] Ooshraxa: fire-gary!
[4:56:02] kaihole: Oh there's a 50% exp buff? Nice, I don't keep up.
[4:56:10] PlebXL: @Towelliee what up to now have been the most fun class you played? with the new talent trees.
[4:56:45] PigPenLen: @91Niki towSip towSip
[4:56:55] Rakim88: if its broken its meant for constant testing then L)
[4:56:59] Rakim88: :)
[4:57:03] MrSnekyDino: Is that the default cast bar? Damn looks so good
[4:57:21] PlebXL: @th3phantomlord are you the csgo scamer from back in the days? KEKW
[4:57:38] Drugovitch: @Towelliee convince blizz to make a glyph of final verdict for the templar's verdict. This way we can still have that badass hammer animation option
[4:57:42] Nerdshockz: can you move the castbar yet? @Towelliee or still not implemented yet?
[4:57:47] Klako1: can  you move the cast bar?
[4:57:52] garlicco: u might get quests for this area anyway
[4:57:55] 91Niki: He likes the warmth
[4:57:57] raye_gaming22: 100k kekw
[4:57:59] 91Niki: Too cold outside the lava pool

[4:58:27] ZonnyArk: Pepehand
[4:58:46] BoezIRL: magical lava
[4:58:55] ashnmsr: stop killing the lava boys!
[4:59:00] jetributions: do you have the high ground
[4:59:13] SLoPPYALieN: YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!
[4:59:20] Kisswani: I liked SL zones , but I love how in DF the zones have so many themes within them . each zone contain a lot
[4:59:39] Crugrator: does avenger shield not interrupt anymore or is it a bug?
[4:59:42] Ezekyler: i hate you towRage
[4:59:51] mekatok: these hunter pets look so damn cool
[4:59:57] BlackCl0ud: this zone really has a vanilla feel to it
[5:00:02] SLoPPYALieN: hunters pet
[5:00:02] BoezIRL: quest
[5:00:39] TompsonX: I'm curious about the healer prot pally based on consecration
[5:00:45] danimoto10: probably will fix it next build
[5:00:50] Ralykx: The red from the lava on your face in that dark room looks awesome!
[5:00:58] belaham: Im hoping prot warrior is in a better place for DF
[5:01:12] 91Niki: @danimoto10 Yeah, something probably just broke when they implemented it onto the alpha servers
[5:01:17] itscityboy: is prot warrior still useless?
[5:01:24] TompsonX: Does it seem good though? I saw lots of consecration synergy and word of glory synergy
[5:01:28] TompsonX: so it seemed fun
[5:01:31] 91Niki: @itscityboy They deleted them in DF Kappa
[5:01:32] raldrik: so basically Protpally is the group
[5:01:33] silodin: `XD
[5:01:35] Carahail: @itscityboy tree isn't out yet

[5:04:01] OviTheGray: @BoezIRL tnx
[5:04:10] Macrodotz: explain again I had 8 adds lol
[5:04:41] Daarksyde: thats because they bought out that new group/company to work on world content
[5:04:46] thenormalbeast: Maybe that is why Ian said they would have dedicated people for each spec working only on trees
[5:04:46] Rakim88: zones r actually connected Pog new system

[5:17:40] Rakim88: HUH
[5:17:40] j_bar111: say gratz to the lock

[5:19:28] ScottxTee: Towelliee whats up!! Love watching you stream while at work lol your voice is so chill and love the content. Thanks for what you do!
[5:19:52] silodin: wasn't that one bugged with the 800 procs/sec
[5:19:54] Myrror: so gear is dropping ilevel 200 so if we are full 304 season 4 gear we won't be replacing anything quickly good to know
[5:20:29] silodin: no way it will be 200
[5:20:29] looney199725: 311 for hc doesnt sound right either
[5:20:33] Krue_Sr: possible squish?
[5:20:35] Myrror: mythic 0 season 4 drops like 262
[5:20:38] manmower: 180 is fresh 60 in SL level power
[5:20:39] Goyem: they definitely haven't tuned the ilvl
[5:20:42] Wcvechten: you probably do levelling from 50-60
[5:20:43] br3z: ilvl squish maybe
[5:20:43] raye_gaming22: 180 is the lvl you will be hittig 60
[5:20:45] Aquadriel: 180 is nathria lvls
[5:20:46] dwanex_: 180!? that sounds way to low
[5:20:47] raye_gaming22: they are on spott
[5:20:47] danielthegathering: what ilvl is nhc
[5:20:48] belaham: maybe brand new player experience @Towelliee ?
[5:20:50] danielthegathering: isnt it like 180
[5:20:51] paravak: Fresh leveling char you will be
[5:20:53] kibarashi: remember. a FRESH lvl60 is around 120-180 ilvl
[5:20:54] silodin: if 200 is enought to quest then 280 mains are going to be OP as fuck
[5:20:56] Mecabeast: 180 is doing the covenant storyline basically
[5:21:00] Rakim88: considering s4 ilvl that will be boosted up
[5:21:12] K3ks112: 180 is lil bit above new 60
[5:21:15] cahoots82: mains are always OP af when going into new leveling content
[5:21:18] Blvdman: yall leveled a fresh char?? with no access to mains? item level is legit 100-160 when u ding 60
[5:21:30] CoffeeDMG: how does the pally feel so far? i main a prot pally and I think the tree looks pretty good.
[5:21:31] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[5:21:43] manmower: hunters are on no ones side
[5:21:46] venom366: its alpha KAppa
[5:21:50] strike879: warmode?
[5:21:55] raye_gaming22: so its fine or fresh chars get trucked
[5:21:57] MattJ063: That would explain why on 9.2.7 aside from season 4 stuff there is no catch up gear of any kind and if you don’t do M+, Raid or PVP you will be looking at max 252 to 265 ilvl
[5:21:58] jeflag: even hunters hate hunters
[5:22:07] OviTheGray: dragon isles didnt get the memo :)
[5:22:31] manmower: you can do fated LFR in 9.2.7
[5:23:05] TompsonX: gamers
[5:23:10] looney199725: gz
[5:23:11] strike879: i hope lfr counts for the currency quest
[5:23:11] danielthegathering: you skipped anduin AND killed anduin? that is a strength of feat
[5:23:15] Brodih_: gratz towClap
[5:23:17] supersegue: jailor mount Pog
[5:23:18] stallowned: grats POGGERS
[5:23:21] Cidal_: @strike879 it should
[5:23:34] danielthegathering: i see!
[5:23:58] Wcvechten: SLG time again Kappa
[5:24:01] looney199725: wait do we still keep boss skips tho in s4?
[5:24:05] j_bar111: testing modCheck
[5:24:09] Myrror: is mythic coming out week 1?
[5:24:09] Brumbs: @Towelliee really like your stream, thats all:)
[5:24:15] looney199725: cuz ppl will skip to end bosses to sell the achiv boost
[5:24:17] Rakim88: YEP total unknown
[5:24:18] danielthegathering: base lvl 60 should be like 230 going into df (that would be crafted/zereth mortis starting gear)
[5:24:20] pixxelina: LUL
[5:24:22] Shrapnel_Sponge: think we're just doing it on normal as we want the slime cat mount LUL
[5:24:24] jeflag: shadowlands is the final boss of the expansion
[5:24:25] mekatok: @towelliee what is he jailer mount?
[5:24:28] danielthegathering: or they increase crafted in season 4 to 260?
[5:24:34] MattJ063: I would take free loot lol
[5:24:39] Rakim88: we dont know the affixes either
[5:24:40] venom366: @Towelliee pre patch when? Kappa
[5:24:43] MOLAR305: when you switch covenants do you keep your great offerings
[5:25:05] looney199725: @venom366 november ish id say
[5:25:10] Secret_Cervix: Are hey doing nerfs and buffs in the next build on Tuesday?
[5:25:21] Rakim88: there was
[5:25:27] aloken1312: prepatch next tuesday Kappa
[5:25:32] Rakim88: premit to link
[5:25:34] wickedtrickz: can you fix classic tbc servers plz
[5:25:34] martzerarh: @MOLAR305 yes
[5:25:38] xRezzylol: If lfr drops 265 then normal is 278
[5:25:43] propwash80: @towelliee is the pally talent tree out?
[5:25:49] Bertiebear2004: @Towelliee Classic is down, do you think they might be implementing the northrend pass thing like they did for TBC?
[5:25:54] lloydimus: I need prepatch info so I cam put my PTO in!!!!!
[5:26:02] mekatok: what does jailer mount look like @towelliee
[5:26:03] MattJ063: I would say when they transition from alpha to beta then we will see prepatch hit PTR
[5:26:06] Rakim88: normal is 278/285
[5:26:09] SLoPPYALieN: something X-rated
[5:26:29] forthereals: chills
[5:26:41] propwash80: YO CHAT is the pally talent tree out?
[5:26:53] SLoPPYALieN: YO yes yes
[5:26:55] SLoPPYALieN: sorta
[5:26:56] llNoTToXiCll: @propwash80  dont bother
[5:27:34] llNoTToXiCll: @propwash80  from what i watched Pali talent tree isnt in good shape at all nor mage
[5:27:59] Asyia3: !yt
[5:28:00] Moobot: @Asyia3 Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Protection Paladin Talents & Abilities - Eye of Tyr RETURNS! youtu.be/pjIT8tV_QKM
[5:28:10] ze4lex: @towelliee  tldw?
[5:28:18] Gillettefuzionz: @NoTToXiCLuL well that's just false
[5:28:18] propwash80: dang well hopefully they can change it on time @nottoxiclul
[5:28:26] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee sorry already watched other creators react to your reaction of the pala talents Kappa
[5:28:48] llNoTToXiCll: @Gillettefuzionz  explain
[5:29:23] Celwind: oh
[5:29:52] Rohen86: Just tuned in. How does prot feel?
[5:30:55] miroslaau: nice shield
[5:30:58] Brumbs: do we know when warlock talents come out?
[5:31:04] Gillettefuzionz: @NoTToXiCLuL the fluidity of the tree is well in good shape. Some talents are different/new and need testing. But the utility is great. Ret actually looks amazing to the ret community, everything fun about the spec is still there - feels like it has been made by a modern ret player. Prot is ok, the main problem overshadowing the talents it the fact that AS isn't interrupting
[5:31:11] zorritojr86: are legendries going up on ilvl next week or na?
[5:31:19] Rakim88: @Brumbs soon TM
[5:31:24] ze4lex: @towelliee  is every tree bad or just some of the trees?
[5:31:32] spiceyholo: ofc there is a reason. they want feedback on the talents -_- why do you think they released it
[5:31:39] Ensanee: feel like they needed to release it for feedback
[5:31:41] llNoTToXiCll: @Gillettefuzionz  i wasnt talking about the fluidity i was talking about the bugs within the talent tree that hear are not in good shape right now
[5:31:41] Brumbs: @Rakim88 ooh bb
[5:31:44] Gillettefuzionz: @NoTToXiCLuL it's just mostly not working as well. But the tree itself is good not that it is in bad shape
[5:31:46] ze4lex: i meant for paladin
[5:32:24] llNoTToXiCll: also thank you for taking time to explain that i appreciate you doing that so i know more
[5:32:34] stoowu: Naowh Is streaming it
[5:32:43] Rakim88: quin is, but insight LUL good one
[5:32:49] cabalish: quin is investigating
[5:32:57] Gillettefuzionz: @NoTToXiCLuL so the talent tree isn't in bad shape. Just that the rest of the game wasn't ready for its implementation. I don't know if english is your second language. Saying the tree is in bad shape is misleading, to what you actually meant
[5:33:01] Ulfinator: @Towelliee how does the new dragonriding updates feel?
[5:33:06] ze4lex: how is the prot tree?
[5:33:10] propwash80: @gillettefuzionz had ty for explaining in looking forward to checking out ret
[5:33:16] raye_gaming22: quin lol you better of asking me and i never palyed ret in my life
[5:33:30] asmodai4823: quin was r1 pvp in s1
[5:33:40] Daarksyde: @Towelliee you excited about the Warrior banner coming back?
[5:33:44] Brumbs: @Towelliee what class has felt the most "ironed" out thus far? like theyve done well at tuning and balancing for fun and sake of progressing
[5:33:54] raye_gaming22: @asmodai4823 elo boosted
[5:33:57] zgag: Quinn does all sort of crazy stuff with the POE tree.  He will probably figure out the new talent tree pretty quick
[5:34:04] Daarksyde: datamined
[5:34:08] ze4lex: skull banner

[5:34:12] asmodai4823: @asmodai4823 Kappa
[5:34:18] Scarhearth: Is there any word on what will happen to the SL legendaries @Towelliee ?
[5:34:25] Gillettefuzionz: @propwash80 no worries, I understand what @NoTToXiCLuL is trying to say. He just made it sound like the trees were bad, which in fact they aren't its that its not all working on alpha right now. But do have a look at them, they are pretty cool. Waiting on Holy - which I main
[5:34:26] Artiiz: How are prot pallys?
[5:34:56] Crabsir: warrior banner, what is this, GW? LULW
[5:34:59] llNoTToXiCll: @Gillettefuzionz  i tend to do that but i also think people get what im saying
[5:35:04] Daarksyde: i like the theme where Blizz is bringing back buffs and talents that makes users help the raid more and not just themselves
[5:35:08] notColt45: peepoRun
[5:35:09] Daarksyde: hence Evoker
[5:35:10] Rakim88: @Scarhearth some have become talents so far
[5:35:36] Decoy101: cohh7 cohh7 cohh7
[5:35:38] Valhuun: f
[5:35:44] Scarhearth: @Rakim88 well yes im more worried about if theyll just turn them into blank slate items that have nothing
[5:35:50] UltraKSlaya: that's an old warrior ability coming back
[5:35:58] Rakim88: he died in the tutorial FailFish
[5:36:00] silodin: Sendrax body for dracthyr when?
[5:36:00] Gillettefuzionz: @NoTToXiCLuL well you said not to bother, I would assume most people in chat don't have alpha. So discouraging people from even looking at them, is against the point of trying to gather feedback
[5:36:23] Shrapnel_Sponge: i reckon after SL they will just be stat sticks
[5:36:25] raye_gaming22: there is a huge post inc with all the info for S4

[5:52:49] berserker_strike: can u show your talents ?
[5:52:51] Utmost777: Are you not able to switch to Holy? Wowhead still has Holy as incomplete

[5:54:46] MARTZiiE: for me thats mega hype
[5:54:55] Brynhilderr: they should add a trait that lets you insta mount while falling once every few minutes to counter that
[5:55:01] MARTZiiE: maybe open world pvp will be a thing again
[5:55:01] lunchbox8669: you can gather while on dragonback??

[5:57:09] Thoreya: i watch quin for 2 mins looking at shaman talents and my god that chat is insane
[5:57:10] Ensanee: @Artiiz nice opinion, too bad no one cares
[5:57:13] Thoreya: clown show
[5:57:19] adambtwitchtv: I hope these glyphs aint locked behind like HC or mythic raid bosses

[6:48:40] manmower: necrolord gear doesn't really fit the theme of this zone
[6:48:43] zgag: Blizzard should have had dracthyr testing the last part of Alpha
[6:48:45] HeatherJC83: i wanna heal alpha
[6:48:46] Bubblecrisp: woah this zone is really pretty
[6:48:50] tastytictacs: @Chochuche i mean, a lot of legendary powers and covenant abilties are put into the tree because most people liked the effects even if they didn't like the whole covenant system
[6:48:52] Gezber: no it was 800 quadrillion
[6:49:04] HeatherJC83: sorry my A was sticky

[6:54:54] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee i meant where you showed on the map in taladar, that is where shat is

[6:56:49] Zilberg: morfPog What's this dungeon?
[6:57:30] Zilberg: Avenging shield not give holy power anymore?
[6:57:48] DramaticTv: nope
[6:57:49] manmower: this zone reminds me of Eonar from the Antorus raid
[6:57:50] chrslp: Some fucking trucker launched a rock into my Mach E's windshield. Almost $2k to replace! Had to chase the semi down for 15 minutes before they stopped and cops had to force him to give me his insurance who have already accepted responsibility
[6:57:51] DubakuMatumbo: @Towelliee How does prot feel?

[7:00:04] JLmorten: JLmorten subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months, currently on a 74 month streak! 
[7:00:08] Zilberg: Who are they giving these alpha keys to LUL
[7:00:11] wulftrn: just like live KEKW
[7:00:13] Timothious: why would he leave
[7:00:20] slowfetch: probably just nervous playing with the goat
[7:00:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP Ding
[7:00:49] ZyntosAran: imho people who leave an instance in alpha should immediately get the access revoked :D
[7:00:57] Shattermare: Thoughts on tree?
[7:01:02] Zilberg: I really hope they fix the shield thing.. that seems like a huge thing to miss
[7:01:04] Phatori: mayb they had irl stuff come up bud
[7:01:06] miikks: is this normal difficulty
[7:01:08] Phatori: dont be so negative
[7:01:12] this_reformed_bird: Yeah you're right irl emergencies cannot happen in alpha :) @ZyntosAran
[7:01:19] Mcaffee: Looks like pala is a hot mess
[7:01:24] llNoTToXiCll: @Shattermare  they provide oxygen MiniK
[7:01:46] JustSaiyan91: Really like the look of the new enemy castbar
[7:01:52] Shattermare: @nottoxiclul I don’t want any of that stuff
[7:01:58] Zilberg: No interrupt and no holy power...
[7:02:02] watpuppy: moms?
[7:02:07] wulftrn: True and not gain HP
[7:02:07] Aro725: is divine toll supposed to generate holy power too?
[7:02:08] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[7:02:11] Timothious: are they using the ingame voice?
[7:02:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Probably a bug towCopium towCopium towCopium
[7:03:03] TheItalianStallion321: i honestly think 90% of the tree was bugged of what you reported
[7:03:03] Zilberg: If they don't fix the interrupt or holy power issue ....
[7:03:09] cptrogers123: Prot warrior seems promising
[7:03:19] Lukasvana44: paladin just felt the same for so long imo
[7:03:20] Scarhearth: mage is dogwater
[7:03:25] Egzolinas: Is it bug or is it intended for Avenger Shield not to interrupt?
[7:03:28] llNoTToXiCll: @Shattermare  my thought is that i think it will be way better than the talent system they were using i'd rather beable to choose a lot rather than choose from 5-6 options
[7:03:35] stoowu: @Towelliee same, I'm not doing an expansion of neutered Prot Pally when live is so damn good
[7:03:36] Mecabeast: @artiiz check the youtube and today's vod
[7:03:39] TheItalianStallion321: @Egzolinas i dont think they have responded yet
[7:03:39] wulftrn: prot war seems top tier
[7:03:50] danimoto10: there is no way its intended
[7:03:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmaster could be the ticket, in theory
[7:04:04] Ooshraxa: MANY WELPS
[7:04:07] llNoTToXiCll: @Shattermare  that meaning from the talent rows *
[7:04:08] Ooshraxa: HANDLE IT
[7:04:17] herash_gaming: herash_gaming subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:04:17] wulftrn: brewmaster was always good
[7:04:21] Egzolinas: @TheItalianStallion321 thank you HeyGuys
[7:04:44] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee You'd think if they had changed AS on purpose, they would have made an explainer post about it.
[7:04:57] Zilberg: I mean if everyone is complaining about it being garbage.. They should obviously fix it
[7:05:01] llNoTToXiCll: i think with geared out group this dungeon could be really fast
[7:05:12] Gezber: they'll have to make one once they get pressured
[7:05:18] Phatori: nah youd think if it was a bug they would of responded. they shipped it and now they are discussing it
[7:05:31] slowfetch: i dont know if this dungeon is fun but it looks great
[7:05:57] Zilberg: Ret talent tree came out too right? I wonder how that feels
[7:06:48] Aro725: lmao cruisinggg
[7:06:58] RadRage69: wait DT doesnt generate holy power?
[7:06:58] Jawis: ngl, the dungeon looks great
[7:07:02] Timothious: When you que for dungeons do you get mixed alliance horde groups?
[7:07:03] Bareno: comparing the live/beta versions of AS on wowhead, looks like all they did was change the tooltip, they didn't remove the silence effect on beta, but it still is missing the silence effect on beta 🤔
[7:07:14] wulftrn: would love e that push for blood dk lol
[7:07:14] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW

[7:07:44] Texas_Mizfit: look at bosses debuff
[7:07:46] RadRage69: @Zilberg 1000%
[7:07:54] Vetyst: Uhm, how are those elementals going to work with sanguine? Wont they just heal back up while they cast the blast?
[7:07:56] Texas_Mizfit: it says clear all elementals
[7:07:58] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee he has a buff that tells it, but yes, it should be a bar
[7:07:58] Decoy101: the 2nd boss has a buff on her right now saying you have to eliminate all of the Blazebound Destroyers
[7:07:59] bablii18: You need to kill 4 BIG elementals who protect the boss with 4 buffs.
[7:08:03] EKS90_: or its like firelands, he just "spawns" when enough is dead? @Towelliee
[7:08:05] generaljosh721: There’s a buff on the boss it says kill all elementals
[7:08:10] Tryhardion: You need to kill 4 big elementals
[7:08:17] TweektheProphet: it specifically those fire elementals but it should have some indicator
[7:08:30] strike879: what happens if you auto walk and an evoker uses fly with me do you keep walking? allot of troll opertuity if you do keep moving
[7:08:44] ContraRob: are those castbars under the default nameplates new? I love that
[7:08:46] JustSaiyan91: So evokers are going to be light blue like mage or haven’t decided a color yet
[7:08:51] bablii18: @Towelliee 4 Blazebound destroyers = 4 shields of the 2nd boss. Which will make the boss active.
[7:09:09] Zilberg: Vetyst Pretty sure it's already dead and just casting an explosion
[7:09:11] Phatori: @JustSaiyan91 evokers are green. just like how they are on teh screen now
[7:09:21] Ooshraxa: @ContraRob everything you see is new default ui, addons aren't enabled
[7:09:28] 3663Sharad: No Divine Toll in DF for Paladin? Sadge
[7:09:29] ZyntosAran: @JustSaiyan91 they are green
[7:09:48] NickLeonhearth: maw of souls :D
[7:09:52] Zayvion: Great one for keys lol
[7:09:52] slowfetch: heck yeah new freehold
[7:09:53] jetributions: maw of souls 2.0
[7:09:56] ryhasmicer: Lovely with a short dungeon!
[7:09:56] Phatori: they might be color blind (legit not being an ass) it might come off as light blue
[7:09:56] EKS90_: @3663Sharad its there, just broken atm
[7:10:04] chrslp: I dont like super long dungeons
[7:10:05] 3663Sharad: ah k ty
[7:10:07] generaljosh721: Good
[7:10:25] chrslp: Raids- make them as long as you want. But I'd prefer to be out of dungeons in 20-30 min
[7:10:26] Zilberg: I like short dungeons.. Boss boss boss.. next
[7:10:28] EKS90_: having a short dungeon is not a bad thing, like some short, some long, is a good mix IMO
[7:10:28] llNoTToXiCll: i like the nameplay color of evoker its like a dark cyan
[7:10:32] llNoTToXiCll: plate*
[7:10:33] Brodih_: no BRD vibes here thats for sure
[7:11:11] Aro725: ret
[7:11:17] kulriko: ret\
[7:11:40] wulftrn: prot gets screwed on hp
[7:11:41] Spathotan: Think thats Ret. Ret can build Conc as their main dps basically, its pretty strange.
[7:11:42] SpyCrabbo: i guess so consecration doesn't feel as bad anymore
[7:11:44] Zilberg: I feel like it feels a bit rushed... So hopefully they fix it
[7:11:48] chrslp: Man that dragon he just hopped off of would make a SICK mount

[7:12:33] Zilberg: Is the consecration healing any good?
[7:12:33] chrslp: I want that boss as a mount so bad
[7:12:34] llNoTToXiCll: this was about 10-15 mins
[7:12:58] Ooshraxa: and that's with one missing DPS for a while
[7:13:04] Gezber: with 3 minutes downtime
[7:13:15] Denarianx: that could be 30 minutes timer for M+
[7:13:16] Mitune: so 25 min m+ ish
[7:13:19] EKS90_: not bad at all. having one 15 minute dungeon when the rest are like 25-30, is a nice change of pace.
[7:13:23] manmower: how much lifebloom did he do?
[7:13:24] scenario17: I healed lol
[7:13:37] Velashen: I think it would be cool to have most dungeons short quick easy Peezy. Maybe one mega dungeon with more advanced tactics and length.
[7:13:49] chrslp: I dont have the patience for 30+ min dungeons anymore. This is perfect length for me
[7:14:09] Ooshraxa: SOTR uptime?
[7:14:11] Velashen: @chrslp agreed
[7:14:27] llNoTToXiCll: @chrslp  sometimes i fall asleep in my chair on those long dungeons if ive played later
[7:14:37] manmower: he oversold the lifebloom thing
[7:14:43] Bloodhaven08: its because not much changed
[7:15:28] Titannborn: I’ve been playing for about 16 years just like you I’m getting really good vibes from this xpac

[7:16:25] wulftrn: with these zoomers probably less lol
[7:16:28] killuminativi: the one ability ret never plays, they upgrade it
[7:16:29] generaljosh721: @slowfetch no
[7:16:33] killuminativi: everyone is gonna play around it
[7:16:36] Daarksyde: Ret will be OP with that because of art of war procs
[7:16:44] scenario17: the mouse over frames start hiding all my hots past 3 lol
[7:16:45] slowfetch: agree to disagree
[7:17:01] akacvrtops: dungeons should be 24 minutes
[7:17:06] akacvrtops: lesbionist
[7:17:06] EKS90_: I think between 15-30 minute is good enough for dungeons.   Iam in maps on tarkov for longer than that.
[7:17:24] llNoTToXiCll: thats where M+ comes in
[7:17:31] Aro725: Nah shorter the better imo. Especially for m plus. I hate the 45 min DoS on m plus

[7:31:00] RagingPunk: does the paly feel the same or new?
[7:31:06] Oplak06: Got a question: does the fact that avenger shield is no longeur providing 1 holy power is a bit annoying ? I feel it makes the gameplay a bit more slow. Or maybe there is some kind of replacement ?
[7:31:15] chrslp: Artists got to go crazy this xpac. Lots to do
[7:31:30] Jey1h: @RagingPunk looks the same, hopefully it feels the same.
[7:31:39] Aro725: They said they've been working on DF before shadowlands, what do you think the next expac will be towel?
[7:31:45] joe_g_433: @towelliee where is dragon isles on the world map?
[7:31:51] A_ajz: Is this the waking shore? This one gonna be the first zone in thenexpansion or can you choose what zone to start in?
[7:31:51] RagingPunk: @Jey1h so i guess its in a good place nice
[7:31:55] OGXanos: Man that just part of getting older, less vigor
[7:32:15] chrslp: Will there be dragon talents for faster regen?

[7:32:25] HeatherJC83: @A_ajz it's the first zone, no choosing
[7:32:28] skajaki: did nameplates get an update with the UI? (look and distance)

[7:32:58] joe_g_433: Ahhh gotcha. Thank you!
[7:33:10] strchsr: @Towelliee I think canonically it is but they might have to put it elsewhere to fit on the map
[7:33:15] chrslp: Wait are the dragonriding talents out? Did I miss that?
[7:33:32] Pritamin: Kalimdor and ESK getting smoll
[7:33:34] TheItalianStallion321: its like evolving, its just cool to me
[7:33:38] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: there is still space on the right side of eastern kingdoms. We havent seen it tho
[7:33:39] infinityarty: they just got a wallpaper and throw a dart at it to see where its gonna go
[7:33:45] Zilberg: True... The map is flat and should be round LUL
[7:33:51] ilducce: If this is the map, Why have ppl not gone east to kalimdor?
[7:33:51] Citainuss: i cant wait for Azeroth to blow up and we get a new planet
[7:33:53] dreamwalker213: All those years taking the boat and we never found all these continents Kappa
[7:34:21] dracullus: they could revamp any continent as new content, almost every expac is optional for questing now
[7:34:31] chrslp: They should add little things in the air that if you hit regen some of your dragons energy
[7:34:33] i_am_asclepius: how you liking prot so far? does it play any different at all?
[7:34:40] Daarksyde: @Towelliee (or community) sorry if i missed it but were you able to customize your dragon of you just pick one from a few to choose?

[7:36:36] dreamwalker213: Dragonriding was basically unplayable yesterday
[7:36:42] TheCliffyShow: I liked the treason system in Legion and onward. Didn't do WoD though.
[7:37:02] rocky_rokk: Hey Towelliee would you transfer cosmic Flux to an Alt (Maining next season) for Unity Leggo  or wait till it becomes hopefully account wide?
[7:37:09] strchsr: @Towelliee Okay, I found some old maps from like 15 years ago and apparently the dragon isles are north of Tirisfal/Undercity, and west of Quel'Danas/Silvermoon
[7:37:11] llNoTToXiCll: try making a macro @Towelliee  ?
[7:37:17] Difflect: ok cuz yesterday it was bugged somewhat bad that half the talents weren't working so dungeons were rough
[7:37:19] OGXanos: oooh they should give us a jump off mount attack
[7:37:19] XzloRe: laynaUppies macro dismount into charge button
[7:37:20] quady89: @Towelliee that is going to take me a year to get usued to if they keep it like that :P

[7:37:46] skajaki: what continents are we missing now on map? From previous knowledge
[7:37:53] karter2811: nice and near northrend for galakrond
[7:37:53] Arkitek: do you have it unchecked in the interface? auto dismount in flight

[7:38:26] chrslp: these mobs are so squishy
[7:38:29] XzloRe: is the xp buff also in alpha?
[7:38:50] Fillos08: you could macro the exit vehicle into a few of your main abilities
[7:39:04] Jey1h: @XzloRe exp during alpha/beta is almost always higher then when its released. for testing
[7:39:17] dreamwalker213: @xzlore no, buff ends on launch as far as I know
[7:39:20] XzloRe: mmm
[7:39:22] pigzip: The dragon island is going to be one big space ship and fly off to safety !!!
[7:39:29] TheCliffyShow: I wonder if it's in the same position as it was before the sundering. Since it was an island then to. The force might have pushed it back. I know that makes no sense in real-life geography, but this is a fantasy game.

[7:58:56] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee still better than the Shadowlands travel background. Ardenweald with that bug looked like a permanent night-rave
[7:59:03] broel95: ive been playing wow non stop for like 17yrs and never got any beta playing or like that, why is that chat?`cuz i suck or blizz think iam a casual?

[8:00:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: back in opting into beta was kinda hidden in the account settings
[8:00:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: back then
[8:00:20] broel95: naa but like for pandaria
[8:00:26] EKS90_: @broel95 I have had 4 betas and im none of that.
[8:00:30] Nixis: playing wow from vanilla.. not a single alpha or beta xD
[8:00:31] strchsr: @Towelliee Wait, Wrathion has Vulpera in his blackguard? lol
[8:00:33] TheCliffyShow: Lich King is the only WoW beta I've been in. Of course, I did stop playing for several years. Regret doing that.
[8:00:52] brian_777777777: blizzard doesn't invite me to anything free
[8:01:04] OhNinjaPlease: I have like a zero social credit score, so i doubt I'd ever can get on the streamer andd friends clout list

[8:01:09] reqluim66: O_o O_o O_o
[8:01:11] akia03: wondr if any new bgs are being added
[8:01:17] Ooshraxa: I've gotten alpha previously, but I have spent a fair amount of time on the PTR reporting. No alpha this time around.
[8:01:46] Dimichsky: all streamers got it because its free marketing
[8:01:55] sliproach: I got a email from Blizzard, but it's about hearthstone :(
[8:01:58] raye_gaming22: uless youre EU we top 30-40 guilds have 0 invs atm

[8:02:28] joe_g_433: @towelliee so seeing the alpha and stuff now… you think it’s coming out this year?
[8:02:39] Erlite64: In terms of the community on WoW, how healthy is the mid-tier raiding scene?  Not the hyper progressive level or super casual level.  I’m considering resubbing for this expansion but not sure there’s a happy medium between the two for a person with my intended time and commitment.
[8:02:40] notColt45: Well my brain tuned out at that moment so I still have hope
[8:02:40] manmower: i got some emails about new stuff on the store

[8:04:00] Ithylz: Red one with a crown
[8:04:03] cahoots82: There are probably more AOTC raiders than mythic raiders
[8:04:13] sigma_dk: sigma_dk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[8:04:13] SpyCrabbo: so that's why prime got more expensive

[8:06:07] TheCliffyShow: Wrathion is going to have a moment of learning in this expansion that's going to be very costly.
[8:06:33] SGT_Nost: @towelliee hows prot feel? anything new or unique class fantasy ?
[8:06:42] OviTheGray: @TheCliffyShow maybe he dies LUL
[8:07:03] Zilberg: squadW
[8:07:12] questionablysourcedmeat: Is pally looking good?
[8:07:14] Kasvot_Vaxt: +1
[8:07:24] TheCliffyShow: @akia03 There was that dialogue from Matthias Shaw where he mentions Wrathion asking about Anduin. Not sure if that's still in the alpha though.
[8:07:24] Daarksyde: bro
[8:07:31] Daarksyde: u put it on fire with your sword
[8:07:32] chrslp: that only did 5% LUL

[8:10:25] BarthelemeusNL: did you look at the new ui options already?
[8:10:49] Skaboy_TV: Major city is 3 zones in?
[8:11:05] banditrox12: any word on when beta starts?
[8:11:30] Sollice: Not yet
[8:11:31] dracullus: @Jaylyng probably in ~4 weeks after Phase 6 of Alpha
[8:11:39] farconis: how is pally feeling?
[8:11:41] TheItalianStallion321: OH MIC DROP BLIZZ
[8:11:43] manmower: did you spec into the interrupt?
[8:11:53] hlghside: beta will start when alpha stops being so specific, unless blizzard decides not to do open beta
[8:11:56] Biggamermike: @Towelliee I'm thinking of potentially going Prot pally for DF, with the first iteration of the talent tree out, how is that spec looking?
[8:12:00] hlghside: after all, this is quite the new testing paradigm
[8:12:15] tastytictacs: is that intended? that's such a crazy change to make to pall
[8:12:40] hlghside: the beta is just for tuning always

[8:14:21] TitusMagnus: man I love the design of the dragons in this game
[8:14:26] Ordicos: wraithon still giving cloaks
[8:14:36] Zilberg: Why are his wings so big? LUL
[8:14:41] belaham: are we gonna get another cloak from wraithon?
[8:14:51] Karbonn: They definitely stepped up the character model quality this xpac
[8:14:53] raldrik: sent to the maw

[8:15:48] strchsr: Don't worry she'll be back
[8:15:48] Utmost777: hopefully we never see her again
[8:15:49] Kittastrophe: shes retired
[8:15:50] TitusMagnus: I hope that if wrathion gives us a legendary its a helmet and it's got different types of wicked dragon horns
[8:15:52] Phatori: Imagine playing through the Maw and then when your character dies they would get sent to the maw...
[8:15:54] hatefulangel97: is death knight the closest thing we have to a necromancer?
[8:15:55] Gezber: alex Kreygasm

[8:17:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Good reporting, they have no excuses now
[8:17:31] notColt45: I think silence is legit, but no holy power is weird
[8:17:46] sliproach: paladin too broken removed from DF
[8:18:09] Zilberg: Nerf Paladin.. too strong throw it in the bin for DF LUL
[8:18:12] xarfleen: no way it's not a bug
[8:18:27] Slitze: I couldn't show my face around either

[8:19:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ther zones are looking good, yeah
[8:19:03] manmower: they changed the words in the tooltip, so not sure if it is a bug, they probably just intend to make another talent for it to add the functionality back
[8:19:14] Stampsha: have there been any bugged quests ?
[8:19:21] mavericks312: the biggest part of the work is done being the dragon isles it looks
