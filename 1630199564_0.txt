[2:56:49] ventu105: Because Cristobal Colon was a Discoverer and he died thinking he found a new route to India
[2:57:08] TheAverageGoob: Not having mounts really makes the scale of the world building shine through though, it's nice to start without them tbh
[2:57:22] mama_lawless: I wanna ride an alligator
[2:57:23] ZeroNpcTV: alligator mount so they wont add swimming

[3:06:47] Laelas_sm: no real reason to start a new charchter in new world until fresh servers yeah?
[3:06:54] Sarocus: I'm definitely coming back for fresh servers
[3:06:59] Sollice: Yeah Yea and keep an eye on Towelliee's website :P
[3:07:59] kiruz__: can you Random Find dung now in new world? Or is it more like LFG from wrath that you have to pick people from list?
[3:08:00] xfurie: I think only 1 per region which is bad
[3:08:07] Daemoos6: I can't wait to go back cutting trees Kappa
[3:08:09] Katrikan: @Towelliee whats different with the fresh other than faster leveling?
[3:08:09] Sylixxx: How did you get that sword and shield? Store or in game drop?
[3:08:19] Sarocus: My only problem is that it will overlap with the WoW pre patch, but hey

[3:09:09] mavericks312: damn there nerfing cov callings gold reward amount on the 15th

[3:12:00] Daemoos6: So how's the new 2H GS
[3:12:09] Mahal_11532: it feels really good to play rotation wise, its just the lack of utility choices that hurts

[3:12:32] Dcarter: That’s a fact
[3:12:37] KnsWoW: CLIP IT AND SHIP IT
[3:12:42] Dcarter: There’s builds and things people don’t even realize right now
[3:13:07] tricky_86: Ret is not enjoyably to play that's the problem. We're focused on Holly power, yet EVERYTHING they changed/added in DF is for stuff that does not effect holy power spenders or builders.
[3:13:42] Daemoos6: Rets can go Prot DPS Kappa
[3:13:42] Ander1345: still can't believe there's no mounts in this game
[3:13:45] Dyasis: They will post a 'normal' build, but not their raid build

[3:17:45] 91Niki: I don't care, I will still play feral. Even if we're shit last in dps. I will have fun nonetheless
[3:18:25] smashwow: the problem with feral is technically they're a sin rogue. but they don't treat them like that
[3:18:26] Aidler: might have to look for another game as well during DF
