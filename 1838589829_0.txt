[1:39:34] shwoopty_: 2h gives double aspect power so depends
[1:39:34] Youredoneson666: 2h weapon is more dmg for all spells
[1:39:34] Soaqw: 2 hand they are more broken for now
[1:39:35] 러시아_온_친구: you don't want druid to begin with

[1:39:37] JohnBorpa_: 2h
[1:39:40] dots_wots: depends on the build and the legendary
[1:39:40] Spathotan: You want a 2h if youre doing pulverize
[1:39:41] GladHunter: the speed doesn’t matter, it is the top end.
[1:39:41] lobsterbands: the pulverize legendary that shockwaves
[1:39:41] Clownpiece_OwO: overpower druid is better with 2h
[1:39:41] SamuraiiEX: you want a 2H for high flat weap dmg
[1:39:43] Biggydiggs: legendary effect is stronger on a 2H
[1:39:44] ezmgszi: no 2h, legendary powers get x2 legendary power
[1:39:45] Trazz16: @sodapoppin 2 hand for caster 1 hander for feral
[1:39:46] Darkiin: 2h increases aspect power by 100% or some shit
[1:39:46] Hoothe: depends on the 2h aspect
[1:39:47] underm1nd: 2h is more damage per attack
[1:39:48] Ownech: 2H Core power dmg
[1:39:49] leetuberness: can we skip this song streamer cuz its cringe :) ?
[1:39:49] big_sxy: its not about the speed, its about the topend. But usually slower speed == more topend. so they say go with a slow weapon, but they should be specific.
[1:39:50] Nox219: staff and wave att = win
[1:39:51] Yudee: 2H
[1:39:52] Lt_Sharp: depends on the build

[1:39:56] xdyabolical: lucky hit chance as well
[1:39:58] Shepp22: Totems are in TBC? Do you mean off hand?
[1:39:58] Se7enS0ul: it doesnt matter now, the gear is mostly random without sets
[1:39:59] Skurai21: you need a resource aspect then
[1:39:59] helpmydogisaturtle: @Driix6 ahh gotcha thx LuvSign
[1:40:00] Cameleer: @sodapoppin it depends a 2h legendary power rolls higher, but 1h rolls lower %
[1:40:01] starkos7: @slipqnot11 no respect at all :(
[1:40:02] DannyWasNotTaken: @sodapoppin want 1 hand lvling then swap to a 2 hander
[1:40:03] shwoopty_: int and a good spirit ring helps dpending on build
[1:40:03] ProTeczz: 2H scales better same as your warr lots more dmg and aspect indeed 100% increased
[1:40:06] blindingcoot: 2h with overpower build was poooping
[1:40:09] lobsterbands: you get spirit from the paragons
[1:40:10] Wylis_: 2h can build spirit plenty fast if u build the right stuff
[1:40:12] GladHunter: @big_sxy finally a reasonable person
[1:40:13] slicemasterhillz: You're killing the wrong mobs for the quest. only one of them drops it
[1:40:14] Cheesydin: late game prolly 2H leveling 1H makes sense for regen
[1:40:14] Circassa: @Shepp22 he's talking Diablo 4
[1:40:14] Wylis_: yes
[1:40:15] snackpcks: depends if you need the scale off the 2h vs 1h
[1:40:17] SamuraiiEX: yeah
[1:40:17] ProTeczz: 2H scales better same as your warr lots more dmg and aspect indeed 100% increased.
[1:40:17] xdyabolical: yes
[1:40:17] butternickels: how come you don't stream diablo?
[1:40:18] Camtaro3: yes
[1:40:18] magicsloth: @Shepp22 talking about diablo 4 druids
[1:40:19] Huntakilla: Shepp22 He's talking about Diablo
[1:40:21] shwoopty_: yes but slower so yea slower build
[1:40:21] Darkiin: But dual wielding will give you more modifiers so itll be more QoL
[1:40:23] underm1nd: yes
[1:40:25] iduckbro: xdd people giving wow advice
[1:40:26] Yudee: You get spirit regen from paragon board
[1:40:27] Camtaro3: 2hand is slower and stronger
[1:40:28] Cameleer: @sodapoppin a 2h can roll 80% x power damage, 1h rolls like 40% x power damage
[1:40:30] dots_wots: slower autos
[1:40:35] gayforcandy: probably bigger for cooldown builds
[1:40:36] Yudee: Yes
[1:40:52] hoptweak: @Darkiin Dual wield gives an inherent miss chance debuff. So you need lots of hit chance to make dualwield good
[1:40:53] Xtrasneaky: no legendary WhaT
[1:40:54] Jnick: really just depends what you drop
[1:40:55] shwoopty_: ring for spirit on cc and creeper is op regen

[1:41:45] ostrach: you kill the wrong mobs
[1:41:47] bobertslol: @sodapoppin It will matter more when you figure out what build you run. Cause some builds require you to run an aspect that scales better on 2h
[1:41:54] Youredoneson666: @SinReglas 16k a month apartment, they aren't hearing shit lol

[1:42:01] Cameleer: @sodapoppin since you cant stack the same aspects/legendary powers, its all based on what build you go since you want the highest % for that build

[1:49:16] LoRswat: it's not Officially HC Server....just a 1 life.  Players can choose to experience as a HC life with the Addon.
[1:49:16] mad3f: people dont get that its to seperate the non HC players thats why they have the current rules. a dedicated server resloves that
[1:49:17] KapDeKap: EZ

[1:49:36] big_sxy: point is we dont have to worry about who is cheating death on the addon.
[1:49:38] genericco: they should just copy the HC addon rules as best they can.

[1:51:10] cadGG: part of why there's an argument for tougher rules than just permadeath

[1:51:22] DestructibleLost: enforce a 1 living character per world rule PogChamp
[1:51:22] big_sxy: bank alt meta.
[1:51:23] Cameleer: @sodapoppin what if they just made all gear soulbound, but allowed trading in dungeons
[1:51:26] doggoyoga: @Fierced but why not just still use the addon?
[1:51:26] vermiliono: @WiteXDan HUH
[1:51:28] jazeppi: why cant they just disable trade/mailbox LUL
[1:51:30] meeskas: agreed
[1:51:33] habokini: doomer andies LUL
[1:51:34] cutlerrrr: make it so hardcore cant trade
[1:51:35] LJD420: LUL
[1:51:36] unpeacegamin: having an economy is important to the longevity of the game, unless they implement an ssf mode properly in the base game
[1:51:37] cadGG: people will continue to use the addon if only for the deathlogs
[1:51:37] J00sh__: there won't be either :)
[1:51:38] Fierced: @doggoyoga cuz the addon sucks ass.
[1:51:38] Zakkimatsu: everything ruins the game apparently. people can't be happy ever
[1:51:39] wulfpeck: yeah ppl will just still use the addon, i don't get the concern
[1:51:41] 3DSwayze: i'm sure blizzard cares
[1:51:42] big_sxy: Gotta grief bank alts lul
[1:51:42] nizzlerr: @WiteXDan wtf are u talking about lmao
[1:51:45] fractalbender: i want trade personally
[1:51:45] Persianess: just make it so you can only have 1 character at a time
[1:51:47] MTedronai: whale griefers can just buy a dozen preleveled 60s so they always have a replacement char when they die griefing
[1:51:49] WhuDoneIt: Addon didn't stop Bag Jones
[1:51:49] MurtagDev: the addon is for SSF enforcement
[1:51:51] Emerno: 1 char no alts, death = delete
[1:51:54] maplephelps: your toon looks like you
[1:51:54] Ara_Hoshizora: Just cant trust blizzard to do half of what the addon devs do
[1:51:54] msq_p: we already use the addon, it just might end up being the same on official
[1:51:56] qubilly: ssf hardcore, simple though most won't play
[1:51:56] Jubular: o7
[1:51:56] yeahp0n: maybe trades or mail wont work even for alts. Trial accounts worked that way so its there
[1:52:00] D_DeFy: @sodapoppin It would be sick in if you could loot all the non soulbound items /gold if you PVP on the official server
[1:52:01] mackewow: @sodapoppin you're so close dont DO ANYTHING NOW LIKE AN ASS
[1:52:01] gayforcandy: im curious to see how a hardcore MMORPG economy develops
[1:52:03] meeskas: the problem is the 5 wow devs they have are busy playing wow
[1:52:04] Darkiin: it sucks because i want trading but people will abuse it so fast
[1:52:07] New_Game_Plus_o7: I'm expecting them to forget a rez for the first week or somthing stupid
[1:52:08] Fierced: @cutlerrrr yeah, great logic. 90% of the crafts cant be done without trading, cant level enchanting without having a BS rod. wow isnt made for non trade.
[1:52:12] maze187: i dont understand why someone playing the game the way he wants to ruins it for you
[1:52:13] Mister__Blue__: we all know the game will have no changes, only that perma death and thats it
[1:52:18] bobjoe55: imagine some guy kites the dragon into SW bank and takes out like 20 bank alts and millions of gold lmao
[1:52:19] iduckbro: xdd oh boy
[1:52:20] vermiliono: Pog

[1:52:28] Zakkimatsu: Aware PK
[1:52:30] caleb_thewhitehand: we would have a rogue epidemic
[1:52:31] wulfpeck: like 80% of hc live would group with ppl not on the addon, the /LFG meltdowns are gonna be amazing
[1:52:32] Qus3r: @Emerno or just no ah and no trading no mail. like it shud be. its cinda easy.
[1:52:35] Magenta2319: Runescape PVP

[1:52:46] Rjck1337: No way they make new ideas
[1:52:46] xCadranx: Looting players would just lead to RMT
[1:52:47] cheesestinkfarty: starforge systems cx
[1:52:49] Ragewise: naw cheaters and rmters would ruin it if looting players was possible
[1:52:53] carlosantonioar: WATCH OUT THE TREX!
[1:52:57] Fossabot: Sodapoppin's twitter: twitter.com/Sodapoppintv
[1:52:59] Cameleer: I think making 100% of the items Soulbound and putting 4 hour trade timer on gear to people in the group, all of hardcore would be fixed for blizz hc
[1:53:00] Enderberg: dungeon spamming meta in official HC
[1:53:02] Yevonai: Again, what's the point of having Oficcial HC servers if ALL it is is permadeath.  You mean it takes Blizzard month just for that one single change?
[1:53:06] scepps: they should have a tier system, like gold is no trading and bronze allows trades and other shiit
[1:53:07] cutlerrrr: @Fierced yeah, prolly just thought to make it the sameway they did in osrs
[1:53:08] chb1889: it works quite well right now
[1:53:09] qubilly: there's hardcore Ironmen on osrs and they're the minority. in osrs though you can literally do anything solo unlike in wow
[1:53:12] Fierced: @doggoyoga Go and level enchanting. tell me when you get past 75, cuz you wont. multiple crafts need other proffs, the game isnt made for non trade.
[1:53:15] uKSIMMONDS: hows Dew
[1:53:17] Mister__Blue__: @Yevonai YEP
[1:53:18] Drugovitch: why are you with that face that you gonna die at any moment?
[1:53:19] meeskas: a little monkaW
[1:53:20] Bergnowski: I dont see how bots would survive long enough to farm much gold which can be sold
[1:53:22] Jmens315: @Yevonai thats not going to be the only change.
[1:53:25] Santacloz: @Yevonai the only real upside to the official hc is that the griefers have to be hc too
[1:53:26] Void_Mako: lies soda didnt die
[1:53:31] ihaveneversubbedordonated: sure they implement other rules, not just perma
[1:53:37] horner70: yup
[1:53:37] laterbowl: you have massive Roman from Succession energy bro
[1:53:40] genericco: it's blizzard they dont give a single fuck
[1:53:42] wulfpeck: @sodapoppin imagine the meltdown in LFG when 80% of players wont group with people who don't have the addon tho
[1:53:45] Emerno: like when Classic Naxx and Shadowlands launched at the same time?
[1:53:45] Fierced: @cutlerrrr idk fuck all about osrs, so cant talk on the subject youre bringing up
[1:53:45] loulegoz: its more than i would bet
[1:53:46] azncheesy: it took 1 year for OTK Sodapoppin LULW
[1:53:46] mrperson1234: @Fierced that is intended
[1:53:46] pepe_hands1: yep
[1:53:48] msq_p: good point

[1:53:52] Sprinngg: soda i know you are more a just chatting streamer now but do you like mario 64 speedruns?
[1:53:52] Fatal_Flaw: oh 100%

[1:53:55] ImOnlyTom: they need to fill the content gap
[1:53:57] iamfunboy: Bruh, you gettin' exercise?
[1:53:58] DigitamZ: they don't wanna stack with ToC launch too probably
[1:54:00] ChillyHTX: Corpa  boost numbers for the quarter
[1:54:01] SpeedOMike: they'll do some scuffed beta first for sure
[1:54:01] kyoto777: @Heisenberg004 they can just tele to a safe spot when in danger
[1:54:02] Darkiin: Im going to cope and say its because they're also adding changes
[1:54:06] Napsterlul: D4 is not gonna die down in month i think
[1:54:07] J00sh__: the intern that runs classic has google how to do it first but he's got exams
[1:54:07] genericco: blizzard still thinks we're dumb for playing classic at all
[1:54:08] Jmens315: there are going to be other rules implemented... cmon guys. be negative about the game when it comes out. why say the game is shit before they even have a chance to present it
[1:54:09] 4Kjone: NAXX OUT PogChamp
[1:54:10] tomo123: There is also wrath new raid
[1:54:13] ragepyre: dont forget mak'rogahn
[1:54:15] Cameleer: @wulfpeck it will just force players to either actually play HC or play with trade which isnt hc
[1:54:15] larochej: If they launched the hardcore servers right now it would kill D4 KEKW
[1:54:22] WhuDoneIt: classic naxx OMEGALUL
[1:54:22] JJayten: togc, d4, and hc in the same month would be stupid
[1:54:22] Fierced: @npaster a month is very leniant LUL
[1:54:24] cadGG: they also pushed shadowlands back lmao

[2:02:46] Zuberex: LEGION OMEGALUL
[2:02:46] Shinigami505: Dragonflight is good man Pog
[2:02:47] SamuraiiEX: Shadowlands release was fun the rest was w/e
[2:02:48] Fatal_Flaw: its mid still worse than legion
[2:02:48] NotQuid: game is good community is trash
[2:02:48] unpeacegamin: cata was really good in hindsight, especially compared to dragonflite
[2:02:48] Darkiin: I notice stat changes in classic alot more, getting upgrades in retail doesn't feel as good
[2:02:49] NotSydd: pressing ur buttons dont feel like they carry any weight
[2:02:50] tomo123: Same clowns made it. The old blizzard Devs long gone
[2:02:50] enforceroneee: because capitalism (store mounts etc.) kills the enjoy
[2:02:50] SkullSmashed: everyone hated legion at the time
[2:02:51] TakeThatBack: What whos talking about me @sodapoppin
[2:02:52] christian_belfortie: Better than the last three expacs. But not a Legion
[2:02:52] Tazerah: DF is good but the pvp is still shit
[2:02:52] zuqei: DF is much better than before
[2:02:53] drizztd00rden: DF > ALL LUL
[2:02:53] Dethstabz: Legion was not good imo
[2:02:53] Grissu_: many things like items has no matter in the scale like classic has
[2:02:53] sunhideTV: I just can't understand why they are removing spells that feel good to press... You can no longer have mighty bash and incapacitating roar at the same time... not to mention feral didn't have clone for like an expec or two
[2:02:53] Udovar575: because you are a boomer hipster who thinks hating on the popular thing is cool ICANT
[2:02:53] Enderberg: Sometimes retail rotations feel a bit too forced imho
[2:02:54] tiryanos: Soda Legion raiding PEPW
[2:02:54] oloschn: Legion was good though @sodapoppin
[2:02:54] annihillape: dragonflight isn't bad
[2:02:57] Dogarian: when gonna play new AMNESIA? @sodapoppin
[2:02:58] Ledroy: fazing
[2:02:58] ClipCraft: that dude is very quiet after flaming me in chat lmao
[2:02:58] thestang264: one click to get group for dungs. gear doesn't feel any better to get
[2:02:58] gertrudesh_: You dont have msq to follow
[2:02:58] Kunarie: watching you play monk in legion was great @sodapoppin
[2:02:59] woodnoteuniverse: DF isnt WoW anymore
[2:03:00] D347Hzor: is a m+ queue simulator afk in town
[2:03:00] Voxygen_: DF is good, but it lacks personalities, community is sleeping
[2:03:01] eldaisk: you should give df a try :D
[2:03:01] nizzlerr: Legion sucked massive dick, dunno why so many liked it
[2:03:02] Fossabot: sodaH Chance's official merch store: https://www.sodapoppin.shop/ Discount codes: POOR, POOR10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 | Support: sodapoppin@teespring.com
[2:03:02] kaleedity: for me it's very cd dependent.  feel like shit without cds
[2:03:03] Aullama: Legion had its faults, but I still enjoyed it a lot
[2:03:03] H3ndr1kH: what is phasing
[2:03:04] weallgonnamakeitbros: no world pvp
[2:03:04] Teredas_: because class homogenization makes everything feel samey. And that makes it feel not exciting
[2:03:05] remers: not getting ur legendary in s1 of legion was dogshit ass
[2:03:05] buffytide: It became more like a grind and lookup a guide than an mmo with actual humans
[2:03:06] hello0d: On retail nobody talks
[2:03:07] brandonger: Retail is just about pushing endgame. Classic is more of an exploration
[2:03:07] Krovix: class order halls were sick
[2:03:08] Viking2512: Draeonor Garrisons LUL
[2:03:08] rhamlore: Oh yeah because legion legendries were not an abstract form of fucking cancer.
[2:03:09] Xarr614: Retail went zoomer, cringe, and way too many chores
[2:03:10] jjonnej: boomer take tbh
[2:03:10] ffejeff: transmog
[2:03:11] JohnSoulz: legion would be much better exp if they fixed issues at start of exp rather than last patch
[2:03:12] Cozmo300: they force you to do too much to keep up
[2:03:12] elvenlykin: agreed
[2:03:12] seesyl: server identity sucked. not being able to play with friends
[2:03:13] BaronCharon: you can't expect a game to keep updating for years and not get stale run out of shit to add on
[2:03:14] IonutStef: Doesn't have a character anymore? It's everything, every MMO ever created, combined.
[2:03:14] skookumchoocher_: Is it because in retail, the world is no longer a character?
[2:03:14] Po1itePanda: no faction identity
[2:03:17] steezyrhino: Forgive me if i'm mistaken but you're killing wrong mobs
[2:03:18] CorruptArkangel: retail PvP is so zoomer mongoloid it isn’t even funny
[2:03:20] qubilly: @sLAyfORfuN well I can't really see how you'd think osrs ironman system will work for wow if you don't rework stuff like enchanting needing a blacksmith
[2:03:20] Skurai21: yeah when was the last cool set they put out
[2:03:21] prairydog: i miss mr T :tf:
[2:03:22] JPJP2: every class can do everything
[2:03:23] Udovar575: @sodapoppin it's like i am listening to a 40 year old classic boomer ICANT please stop
[2:03:23] SinReglas: BBoomer
[2:03:24] Xeevo: and stats being so streamlined
[2:03:25] Zenfar_: chore gameplay
[2:03:28] Rixardqwe: stats on items are SO BORING
[2:03:28] takedoyt: The part you are supposed to 'enjoy' is end-game, and everyone has min-max'd end-game to the point where you are unable to play around because people will ask why aren't you being efficient? Efficiency overshadows enjoyment.
[2:03:28] average_furry_enjoyer: do you agree that wotlk is more retail than classic wow?
[2:03:29] brandonger: Server communities are dead and the playerbase are the ones who killed them. Look at how classic turned out
[2:03:29] elvenlykin: Soda is there any game you are looking forward to releasing?
[2:03:30] FriendlyFeller: @sodapoppin its sad how in classic u remember like 10 different weapon names and in retail 0 SadCat
[2:03:31] weallgonnamakeitbros: Sadge true
[2:03:32] Fossabot: 👉 Can't see doggoArrive or MEOW ? Install https://7tv.app/ (You can also just enable it in FFZ settings under addons)

[2:03:36] Dogarian: new amnesia when? @sodapoppin

[2:03:39] txti0n: Aware
[2:03:39] garbagekidttv: retail is an mmopvp classic is an mmorpg
[2:03:39] genericco: classic wow endgame is kinda trash
[2:03:40] SpeedOMike: half the time Kapp
[2:03:40] BandOfPonies: gaming has just changed Aware
[2:03:40] Xiiimus: it feels soulless at 0
[2:03:41] Araksus: I believe it's because the world doesn't feel solid anymore
[2:03:42] drizztd00rden: BBoomer wtf chat classic is best
[2:03:44] Xiiimus: 60
[2:03:45] vermiliono: @Vinkster HUH

[2:03:45] TakeThatBack: I think I am done for wow, for good this time DF hit me hard
[2:03:47] ok4mie: Retail plays too smooth it doesnt feel like anything u do has impact
[2:03:47] cheesestinkfarty: yea transmog really hurt char identity, along with lack of chase items etc
[2:03:47] Enderberg: Aware modern gaming
[2:03:47] NotSydd: how u feel about d4?
[2:03:49] OrionPVE: @Udovar575 you are tho
[2:03:51] 0tempest0_: wow not even level 110 yet
[2:03:51] daemonics: @sodapoppin it'll never be the same as the good ol days, eh brother
[2:03:52] IlRoche: btw they get rid of the cost for the riding skill in the next patch. you just get it. mount inclusive xD
[2:03:53] Jadedreptilian: They should add a toggle in the interface to show/not show everyone's transmog
[2:03:53] Onfight: games that lack a hint of danger get old real quick...
[2:03:54] LeVshA_24: No wonder you play classic with those takes KEKL

[2:04:17] mindblownd: SUGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[2:04:17] Toasty_Chicken: I think Server identity is an old thing. if they were able to make mega servers without lag etc. that would be better imo.
[2:04:18] AladarTV: I think the Lore of WoW is reallllly important. It used to have such a manly, metal feel to it. It was badass. Now it's a uwu soft game
[2:04:19] annihillape: legion would of been s tier imo if they got rid of all the casino legendary/bis drops from running pretty much anything
[2:04:19] Exkay_: SUGAAAAA
[2:04:22] JCubsy: Outlast trials?

[2:04:30] Fushers: NODDERS DrumTime
[2:04:31] Jmens315: if people say gear stats they clearly havent played a gear character vs a non geared character in retail.  Sure the INDIVIUAL stat does not matter as much because the percentage change isnt as high, but to say that gear upgrades dont matter is so delusional
[2:04:31] 39billy: Smadge why noty

[2:04:34] Udovar575: @OrionPVE huh?
[2:04:35] AladarTV: WoW used to be metal
[2:04:41] Ravenkorpse: retail is just a giant cosmetic grind. no items are worth crafting. no rep items are worth anything
[2:04:41] americanbornchild: Why doesn’t retail have a hc server?

[2:05:39] Chleocat: @Winttyrr System of a down fucks you Kappa
[2:05:40] mogia101: drop rate on quests is just a disguise to get you to want to grind 100 mobs
[2:05:40] Dogarian: @Swithorn hope he get ok
[2:05:42] Enderberg: I thought the low drop chances were on purpose to grind xp?
[2:05:42] kodtheog: !song
[2:05:43] Vohry1: quest drop rate doesnt matter, at least ull have to farm less mobs over all LUL
[2:05:43] HuntersMIA: watching u play this makes me wish age of wushu wasnt so scummy with paying
[2:05:43] ipeefreelyz: Waiting for named quest mobs is the worst part of classic

[2:05:54] Fossabot: SUBSCRIBE TO MY CLIPS CHANNEL: https://bit.ly/3BFnz7b sodaDink
[2:05:54] nikola420tesla: spawn rates on some quests takes forever, have to skip those ones
[2:05:56] MapleSyrupxX: the drop rates are low just because they expect you to grind a little anyways
[2:05:58] Kunarie: @Swithorn have a nice night, feel better
[2:05:59] Cyrukh: classic would be fine with some retail QoL like faster mount, pickups, the way dismounts and pathing works etc
[2:06:00] Chiphazzord: they just want you to grind for the xp otherwise you would run out of quests before max lvl
[2:06:00] Ledroy: monkeyPls
[2:06:01] Sepron_: monkeyPls
[2:06:03] MeezyLoL: especially with class quests and all that
[2:06:05] average_furry_enjoyer: the worst is quests that need 10 mobs but only 8 spawn and you have to wait FeelsBadMan
[2:06:05] uber_ific: I think low drop rates were a thing because killing a shit ton of mobs was an integral part of leveling in classic
[2:06:05] SinReglas: docPls

[2:07:54] Chleocat: I think one of the big issues with how WoW progresses is its vertical progression that essentially immediately makes previous content obsolete @sodapoppin

[2:07:59] seesyl: people level in retail all the time. always people making alts
[2:08:00] KardAU: You can just bypass it, guys if you ever need to do a collection quest for physical items just right click, when the loot ui pops up get the other person to right click it and you can both take the item
[2:08:02] Ashkenazii: But for new players its extremely confusing @sodapoppin

[2:08:05] yeti_91: people did that in Old WoW all the time
[2:08:06] Dellus7: yeah and that's what classic is there for, if people like leveling and the feeling of the world, classic is for you but that doesn't mean retail is bad
[2:08:06] Thalasso1: I watched your episode on channel F the other day, and i think d-kanes story of how he used to play perfectly summerise the diffrence in players minds
[2:08:06] Triadninja: leveling used to be part of the adventure, now it's just a chore

[2:08:07] Enderberg: retail leveling is kinda fun every now and then tho
[2:08:08] yeti_91: buying accounts and shit
[2:08:08] JIMINI: Realm VS Realm game based on GoT Westeros.  Hardcore death = respawn as new family member of houses in your alliance.  Combat heavy PvP game, straight into faction battles and map control
[2:08:08] Swithorn: whole different game really
[2:08:09] noombus: Questing is really good in retail, I love doing it once, but not any more than that.
[2:08:09] Legaccy404: skip leveling and gearing and push ratting that's all retail is
[2:08:10] iiamBaro: cuz lvling in retail is so pointless

[2:08:34] dilatata: FeelsWeakMan anyone remember EQ leveling..... lose xp on death... 4 hours finding a cleric.. running back to your corpse for 2 hours.... grinding for 16 hours
[2:08:34] Yoshimiitsuu: Idk how new players are supposed to pick up the crafting gear system

[2:08:38] GroinSalami: i kind of liked old retail leveling with dungeons through all the expansions instead of picking one expansion
[2:08:39] buffytide: @sodapoppin leveling in retail is really bad atm cause of leveling scaling with mobs. You loose damage when you level.
[2:08:40] aghostwaffle: as a kid i hated lvling, as an adult, i see it as the gameplay itself, i guess we all grow up eventually
[2:08:40] emperor_beardo: true
[2:08:42] elvenlykin: destiny did the same thing, if you want to try to get the story done and learn the lore in order good fucking luck

[2:08:54] mogia101: leveling is fun in its own way, sometimes you want to mindlessly kill things while still getting to a goal. everything now is end game or no game
[2:08:54] ipeefreelyz: Its def a chore to relearn things after taking a expac break

[2:28:13] drpeppertaco: @Merex760 during the pandemic one of the devs had a jenkins build operation on a personal server, nexon approved then when covid restrictions were lifted he never migrated back to official build servers, this is the "stolen code"
