[0:37:31] simplyhebi: timing this with 22 deaths is pretty crazy
[0:37:36] simplyhebi: double mage insane
[0:39:14] IBlackIHIawk: whats wild about this double mage garbo is blizz just nonchalant buffs mage on the last tuning for what like 2 months...when they were already good...lol always mage, cool to see this ele dam tho
[0:39:24] Whitewolf1441: hello jb

[0:40:43] Simkha: They were bad in raid but yeah mage would have to be pretty garb to be bad in m+ cause of util + survivability + damage profile
[0:44:25] Whitewolf1441: !bb
[0:44:25] StreamElements: shanna is bb and this is her face jdotbStop jdotbBb
[0:46:26] flawlesslykun: @jdotb most ppl seem to be of the opinion afflicted is easy... i feel like this affix perma spams you during keys, even more than incorporeal. I just think this week is probably the most unfun so far
[0:47:12] Kmork1: its annoying
[0:47:13] Kmork1: but easy
[0:48:18] flawlesslykun: to call it easy is just wrong dude... the amount of high keys i've seen bricked by this affix is actualy insane. IMHO they should make it spawn way less often than it does, or make more classes able to deal with it

[0:54:30] Simkha: Yeah the problem is how polarizing is is from dungeon to dungeon and fight to fight
[0:55:23] Kyocere: theyve made dispells way too important to have to waste them on afflicted. make it 1 each time instead of a chance at 2
[0:55:26] Whitewolf1441: didn they add the cd to dispel cus of pvp?

[0:55:55] Trenmonster: bruh fucking oath
[0:56:00] Trenmonster: i lvoe this cook
[0:56:11] attiny90: just make the dps do it and refuse
[0:56:27] Trenmonster: there's also way too many necessary dispels in thewse dungeons
[0:56:33] Trenmonster: for afflicted
[0:56:57] flawlesslykun: @attiny90 see that's awful too. imagine being a firemage this season... want to hardcast bitch ? here volcanic, storming, afflicted, go f yourself FeelsOkayMan
[0:57:30] flawlesslykun: ofc there's ways to outplay it btw, but it fucking sucks man
[0:57:41] flawlesslykun: especialy in pugs
[0:58:02] Heapsofjoy: explosive :)
[0:58:32] Simkha: Also the fact that some classes cant even interact with is is just kinda shitty
[0:58:41] attiny90: its designed to point fingers lol
[0:58:45] chiefsvg: which affix?
[0:58:49] Simkha: Like you said, just not a great concept from the get go
[0:58:58] Whitewolf1441: @chiefsvg afflicted
[0:59:39] flawlesslykun: it still spawns just as often as explosive tho Sadge
[0:59:54] flawlesslykun: well maybe a little less i guess
[1:00:06] Trenmonster: if they capped it woulda been ok
[1:00:54] Whitewolf1441: do you think thats maybe by design? blizz doesnt want you pulling half the dungeon at a time, which is apparently by the target cap on aoe

[1:03:06] Whitewolf1441: you dont like affixes at all?????????
[1:03:09] copetk: how bout dungeon design, since afflicted need to be dispeled
[1:03:11] therealborko: honestly I don't even mind incorporeal, but afflicted is hot trash
[1:03:32] flawlesslykun: i am still Prayge for a season with literaly no affixes. i don't even care if trashpacks in a dungeon suddenly have 6 diferent mecanics

[1:08:02] chiefsvg: the only affix ive ever enjoyed was reaping
[1:08:14] anaya909: what they mean is they're not absolutely miserable playing one or two out of the list
[1:08:31] attiny90: i mean it would feel bad week to week.

[1:08:44] pokemongonicolai: i like affix
[1:08:52] LogikHQ: affixes Atleast give a reason to bring different classes in pugs week to week - not that theyâ€™re fun though
[1:08:57] Piaggio: mythic tindral needs afflicted spawns YEP
[1:09:06] flawlesslykun: @chiefsvg same. unironicaly the best affix ever made, brilliant affix in every sense tbh

[1:09:52] Kmork1: druid for sure
[1:09:53] attiny90: rmp is invading pve oh noi
[1:09:59] Darkcurrse: Actually the D4 affixes aren't that bad, and they change up how you deal with a dungeon. Some of these affixes are just irritating to deal with such as Afflicted.
[1:10:44] Simkha: Why shadow over like lock? Just PI?
[1:11:16] attiny90: Extra magic dispell too
[1:11:20] TurdToTrader: pi,soothe,md,ve, fort, brings a lot
[1:11:33] Guffels: boy shadow priests been bitching so much no way they weasel their way back in
[1:11:33] Simkha: Ye I forgot fort tbh lol
[1:11:54] Kmork1: yopu have no kicks then
[1:11:55] attiny90: shadowpriest is just as tanky as lock

[1:12:54] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[1:13:28] attiny90: lol we gonna get last seasons meta again
[1:14:53] flawlesslykun: classic imagine developing a fantastic healer and a very simplistic (but fun) dps spec, and then wasting that develop time and resources by making a 3rd spec that not only breaks the game (because it's so op) but makes the other 2 irrelevant classic sounds like blizz
[1:15:38] Kmork1: war within has to have some major changes to aug
[1:17:01] Piaggio: reminder to respect the last boss KEKW
[1:18:01] Artiiz: Did they remove the dungeon teleports you get for completing a +20 or why not use that?
[1:18:08] flawlesslykun: i respect that opinion. i love it tho
[1:18:09] Guffels: pres is overcooked
[1:18:39] Perry_TP: how tf do you even spot heal on pres, just spam Blossoms? ðŸ’€
[1:19:06] Ochowie: playing pres in pugs is the worst time i've had in WoW
[1:19:14] Guffels: i think it has the mist weaver problem. its very hard to map from any of the classic healers onto pres. has alot of barriers to entry
[1:20:11] flawlesslykun: another indicator it's a fantastic week to push keys btw KEKW

[1:31:40] Guffels: oh we are talking about making sure that every mb is a mini ramp smolderon style
[1:31:58] astranice: i tend to just do like 5-6 flash heals, 2x radiance and then unleash damage :D
[1:32:25] Guffels: it definently should be 2 renew and 1 pwsh not flash heal lol
[1:33:15] astranice: zaelia did flash heals into radiance on rcw
[1:33:30] astranice: rwf sry
[1:35:05] Guffels: i could have sworn it was only 2 renews not 3 but that might just be my haste messing with cdr
[1:36:41] SayNoToStim: I play disc priest at about the same raid prog as you, I use shield - 2 renews - shield, I think I have 6500 haste
[1:37:16] Guffels: i would have to check my vods from smolderon
[1:37:25] SayNoToStim: yeah its like 1/10th of a second, but because the shield gives you  a longer atonement its worth it
[1:38:05] SayNoToStim: honestly that level of min-maxing doesn't matter that much, just getting 8 atonements off + FH + 2 proper radiances is the important part
[1:38:17] Guffels: do cast sequesnces progress even if the spell is on cd?
[1:39:45] Guffels: thats why I just spam shield till i see the atonement pop on the raid frame
[1:39:50] escalantegrande: 4 sec Reset is to short, you dont calculate human delay into it. Would rather recommend to do 5 or 6, have used sequence a lot for tanking in classic and faced that issue
[1:40:01] GetGirthed: put shield cd on mouse?
[1:40:21] anaya909: make that main row of icons a normal group rather than dynamic.  then you can trigger pws to only show on cd
[1:40:37] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:40:41] anaya909: then when you're looking at raid frames or whatever, that empty spot is a lot easier to see without looking at it
[1:42:04] escalantegrande: Why 3 now?
[1:42:21] escalantegrande: Ah okay
[1:42:23] escalantegrande: Got it
[1:44:07] Guffels: default 8 but can be changes
[1:44:47] escalantegrande: Didnt know castsequence Stil working in retail, read something about they removed it in retail, but no XP as i stopped retail long ago
[1:45:03] Guffels: I made a custom spell in the viscereo sheet called mini ramp that I use as the start of ramp timer.

[2:07:54] OutTester: huh. a remix of Bella Chiao
[2:08:13] simplyhebi: they did tune it a little bit lower in one of the DF patches but that was al ong time ago I believe

[2:15:08] Kmork1: chain heal isnt it
[2:16:14] immaironman96: just out of curiosity what would you say is the most squishy healer?

[2:18:57] Kmork1: blessing of dusk
[2:19:15] Snizzlenose: I feel really squishy as disc, mainly from the heavy single target rot bleeds and spells rather than the 1 shots
[2:19:48] skelthu: what do you feel about sp with the groups that have no discipline? could be the new meta?
[2:19:58] toxikdh: hello fellow famed slayer of tindral sageswift

[2:21:21] immaironman96: @Snizzlenose i agree, have a hard time keeping people and myself alive on 2nd boss brh and last boss brh
[2:21:29] Kmork1: pog
[2:21:29] nixar1: why are you raiding on disc if you're pushing on druid? just for fun?

[2:23:36] Kmork1: but we are giga low rank
[2:23:42] nixar1: then why raid at all? 4Head
[2:24:13] ren0m: Would you consider any healer particularly difficult to play?
[2:24:19] Kmork1: bc you can bring youre other toons to farm
[2:24:23] Kmork1: and get sick raid loot
[2:24:33] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[2:25:08] HopeThePriest: There are alot of dogshit disc priest s tho to
[2:25:14] wrastle_mania: Hey boss, what would you consider is a viable tank for m+
[2:25:28] Kmork1: spin a wheel
[2:26:02] catchmetwenty20: did you swap to disc bc other healers couldnt play iit?
[2:27:23] HopeThePriest: I think its because alot try to transition from keys to raid and its a completly different process. Raid requires in depth planning around damage and other healers where keys is just ramp and blast during damage cycles
[2:28:18] immaironman96: i find disc being hard sheerly because i dunno who i commit pain supps to and ramping in raid is kinda rough when you dont know how to properly do it
[2:30:39] MangoMafioso: Disc has probably the highest learning curve of all the healers
[2:33:14] HopeThePriest: I dont think so, maybe from aplanning perspective. I think MW is hard af, and Ive mained pally, priest and druid with some loose shaman along the way
[2:33:25] HopeThePriest: I just dont get monk, like at all
[2:33:39] holako11: how many % did the trinket do last dungen ? damage and healing ?

[5:15:47] Holymiky: wasnt there a couple of deaths on oak? or is that normal?
[5:15:56] tabxzer: is it when he get hit by the swirwel?
[5:15:57] BicardiTV: ramping damage
[5:16:17] tabxzer: ah
[5:16:37] flawlesslykun: i actualy did not know that LMAO
[5:16:41] tabxzer: how do you counterplay that?
[5:16:42] flawlesslykun: so that's why this boss is so aids
[5:20:20] somethineuw: sanchOluwamark
[5:22:01] kelly_mac06: as a hunter i can tell you hunter is NEVER the secret ingredient
[5:22:01] zebbzo91: im 3.275.. is that ok as a tank?
[5:22:06] kelly_mac06: don't be baited lmao
[5:22:51] flawlesslykun: idk man, survival was kinda banging before the nerfs
[5:22:53] zebbzo91: i mean im trying to have fun but hard with ppl complaining.
[5:23:02] tabxzer: I dont hate the game, I hate the people in it
[5:23:13] shadowghostytv: if people are complaining your hanging with the wrong people
[5:24:58] poodzztv: you canâ€™t surround yourself with people or point fingers or deflect blame. It will always make the environment toxic. Need to find people who generally want to get better. People are quick to next someone.
[5:25:17] zerahaha: @tabxzer there are spot the tank can take him where theres less chance of him getting the buff, (getting hit by swirls) but its just RNG
[5:25:21] poodzztv: who point*
[5:25:26] flawlesslykun: @zebbzo91 the most important part of being a tank in pugs, is being aware that u are in a pug. A good tank can legit carry a dungeon
[5:25:29] Whitewolf1441: ok ill queue(im na)
[5:25:38] toastbam: at the end of the day, this is a video game, whats the point of playing the game if youre not having fun
[5:26:10] somethineuw: I love and hate this game at the same time
[5:26:12] toastbam: we can get sweaty and angry, but if we arent having some sort of fun its not worth all that
[5:26:18] kennycuban: I just finished a key with a pally tank with 0 dispells on a afflicted week.... why?
[5:26:32] toastbam: @kennycuban didnt have it talented
[5:26:36] toastbam: didnt care
[5:26:39] toastbam: could be bad
[5:26:41] kennycuban: LUL

[5:30:17] tabxzer: @kennycuban he wasnt wrong though
[5:30:22] somethineuw: LMAO

[5:31:07] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[5:32:48] aFlawks: hey
[5:36:58] aFlawks: looking to get into retail, what's a dps class that's forgiving with high mobility? eventually wanting to run high keys
[5:37:10] Tfos: pugging 29 looks fun so far u have done 1000 laps around fountain
[5:37:17] flawlesslykun: @jdotb what do u want to craft 1st on resto druid for keys btw ?
[5:37:27] toastbam: bm hunter
[5:37:32] Theo_Key: Yeah BM hunter for sure
[5:37:35] aFlawks: awesome thank you
[5:37:44] flawlesslykun: tyty
[5:37:45] aFlawks: i heard somewhere bm hunter doesn't have defensives
[5:37:46] toastbam: its the easiest to learn, and the most mobile ranged class in the game
[5:38:02] toastbam: @aFlawks theyre a lot better than they used to be, plus they have a ton of health
[5:38:03] massiven548: @aFlawks can try monk as well
[5:38:05] aFlawks: that's awesome though sounds like it would fit me
[5:38:06] massiven548: fits your criteria
[5:38:08] kennycuban: @aFlawks they are made of paper lol
[5:38:19] toastbam: @kennycuban thats just not true
[5:38:20] massiven548: and monk is very tanky
[5:38:38] Tfos: actually not made of paper but u have to be smart while playing utilizing feign dead and such
[5:38:46] heygadzie: how many juicy keys u timed ?
[5:38:51] toastbam: @Tfos this
[5:39:22] Theo_Key: I mean, he did say forgiving and high mobility. If you wanna add unkillable, biggest dps, most utility, and whatever else then the game isnt' for you xD
[5:39:38] Theo_Key: It's a give and take
[5:39:43] kennycuban: man any boss with a 2 dots dispells, I need to prioritize the hunter first cuz will die in seconds
[5:39:46] jfcdtv: Swedish
[5:39:48] massiven548: DH is all those tho @Theo_Key
[5:39:50] flowerpwrxd: svensk is swedish
[5:40:05] Theo_Key: @massiven548 LOL truue too
[5:40:38] Tfos: problem is not in hunter class tho but in players playing hunter LUL
[5:40:52] toastbam: @Theo_Key yeah but its ranged, which is much easier to learn in the pve scene than melee
[5:41:29] aFlawks: that's also good to know
[5:41:46] Theo_Key: My experience with BM hunters are they like to bounce around all over the place and end up pullling everything LOL
[5:41:52] heygadzie: 28s are rough this week no?
[5:42:02] kelly_mac06: @Theo_Key then you've played with very bad ones
[5:42:07] toastbam: ^
[5:42:11] Theo_Key: I can't argue that
[5:42:49] kelly_mac06: @Theo_Key it's a shame that it's so popular bc it's perceived to be so easy. it's easy to learn but mastery is a lot more challenging and there a LOT of baddies out there
[5:42:58] Theo_Key: I pretty much only log on for raids now at this point. I'd rather watch ppl play wow than actually play it lol
[5:43:05] Samppson: is shadow back?
[5:43:11] kelly_mac06: @Theo_Key LOL i feel that
[5:43:25] kennycuban: I think there's something about mail armor, cuz aug and evokers are paper thin too (even worst)
[5:43:27] MicHawkh: will u test out holy in m+ next week?
[5:43:30] naeviah: new archeology thing
[5:43:31] heygadzie: KEKW
[5:43:32] SayNoToStim: mole people weekly thingy
[5:43:32] Calair_: new 10.2.5 feast like thing
[5:43:36] flawlesslykun: I ASKED MYSELF THE SAME THING DUDE
[5:43:38] EriktheRed27: it was a large construction project in boston
[5:43:43] toastbam: LOL
[5:43:49] Calair_: theres a mount in it, but just cosmetics no power or anything
[5:43:55] SayNoToStim: oh wait I thought it was mole people thingy, nevermind
[5:44:01] Calair_: I wouldn't call it 'fun' even compared to the other world events
[5:44:08] kelly_mac06: @kennycuban hunters are only super squish if they aren't actively using defensives. BM has a few strong ones
[5:44:10] toastbam: @Calair_ its a lot shorter though
[5:44:10] heygadzie: Do u use reju as rdruid?
[5:44:40] taanzfour: how do you feel about the sp rise again
[5:44:43] Calair_: @Calair_ I think thats worse though. You have a higher % of time waiting for it to happen than actually doing it
[5:45:08] gartsky: show healing breakdown from last key?
[5:45:09] aFlawks: how is balance druid? it's between that and bm hunter i guess
[5:45:12] Theo_Key: in raid, you basically only push rejuv xD At least that's what I was told. I play evoker so idk anymore.
[5:45:16] aFlawks: for the helpful people who are knowledgeable
[5:45:22] kennycuban: @kelly_mac06 don't get me wrong, I always invite a hunter on my keys, but I need to babysit them all the time
[5:45:29] taanzfour: @aFlawks for?
[5:45:41] aFlawks: @taanzfour getting into retail,. eventually high keys
[5:46:05] taanzfour: for high keys currently boomy is popping and its quite easy to play as well but ur group gotta play around it kind of and save it from dying
[5:46:10] toastbam: @taanzfour my suggestion is start with bm, get the hang of retail, then worry about "high keys" because classes for that changes a lot
[5:46:46] heygadzie: hearth of the wild u use for big dps on tyrannical or fortified bosses or do u use it also for like big trash packs?
[5:46:58] aFlawks: @taanzfour that sounds awesome! do u know what mobility is like?
[5:47:07] aFlawks: @toastbam yeah may be the play for me
[5:47:11] Tfos: dont go boomie that thing is CR sponge in hands of new player
[5:47:11] toastbam: @taanzfour boomie is also super mobile
[5:47:22] taanzfour: yeah druids got catform sprint etc
[5:47:32] taanzfour: u even got stealth so no invis pots needed 99% of the time
[5:47:44] kelly_mac06: @kennycuban are they doing lust? if yes then yea they will be squishier bc they lose a really strong defensive they get from pets
[5:47:56] Tfos: also dude will be doing like 15s playin boomie in that range is not fun at all
[5:47:58] kelly_mac06: and i can def see why you'd have to spend more healing on them
[5:48:43] toastbam: the issue with boomie is that, no matter the patch, they really dont do well in lower keys. the damage profile requires large amounts of mobs to live for a while
[5:48:45] kennycuban: @kelly_mac06 yeah that's usually the case most of the time

[5:49:27] taanzfour: surprised there hasnt been any dungeon tuning
[5:49:43] toastbam: it took them like 2 and a half months to do any tuning last season
[5:49:51] kelly_mac06: @kennycuban yea it sucks, we trade our good defensive for our one utility lmao
[5:50:28] taanzfour: yo whats potion of shocking disclosure for?

[5:51:26] taanzfour: is it just for healers or?
[5:51:37] zerahaha: oh god is this a rise of fall
[5:51:38] toastbam: @taanzfour tanks mostly
[5:52:43] heygadzie: I mean i like those mana changes for druid
[5:52:51] heygadzie: but the hpal changes are dumb
[5:52:52] heygadzie: KEKW
[5:53:01] heygadzie: but thx for dmg improvements i guess KEKL
[5:54:52] Tfos: but for raid might be influenced cuz leggo
[5:55:08] taanzfour: the wep is strength that has ntohng to do with lego
[5:55:12] taanzfour: or?
[5:55:20] deerparkfish: do you ever use the leaf trinket?
[5:55:23] ScottTridge: It can drop for hpal still
[5:55:24] Theo_Key: true and real
[5:55:25] Thoreya: ravens texans who u got
[5:55:33] Theo_Key: Ravens
[5:55:34] Tfos: you can drop it as hpal and its easier to get into group as healer
[5:55:47] Thoreya: @Theo_Key my man
[5:55:47] heygadzie: yeah thats true, and raid needs the devo buff anyway so people are sticking with it also
[5:56:13] globzim: whats better in your opinion? the lifebloom buff talent of the one that gives tree of life every 3 swiftmends?
[5:56:20] Tfos: also hpal pumps in raid but is mana hungry thats only issue
[5:56:22] heygadzie: and with the new mitigation tab u see that hpal is not perfoming that bad tbh.
[5:57:07] Theo_Key: True.
[5:57:53] EshWoW: you enjoug rdruid?
[5:57:58] EshWoW: enjoying
[5:58:28] davaIon: Just curious do you push keys on your disc?
[5:59:04] kennycuban: man the cat form is so op also, is so easy to do 50k damage overall with a few rakes and rip
[5:59:46] Zircons: pepeD
[5:59:57] Theo_Key: They need a new class like a mechanic. Tank/dps/heals. A big mech for tank. Some kind of lazer shooter for dps. And a dart gun/healing ray for heals :)

[6:33:54] Holymiky: its alright, I had a tank leave after we were doing smoothly only on a 18 rise earlier cos someone told him to go go on morchie, right before last boss :/
[6:34:02] kennycuban: man do you really think that aug make a huge difference on tyranical weeks? I feel the opposite - I can be wrong tho
[6:34:06] RaxxFPS: If a key is deplete, aka a push key, why would I stay and waste time aintnoway
[6:34:07] Whitewolf1441: so what went wrong in that key?
[6:34:27] Tfos: its crazy they added 2 minutes into timer and they could add another 2 minutes and it would still be tide
[6:34:43] AthoosHS: how bad is it to heal a hunter?
[6:34:51] AthoosHS: or rough rather
[6:35:21] flawlesslykun: @kennycuban i would love to see the math on that question ngl. i legitimatly think that unless you're playing with a premade and a aug that is a complete chad, it is actualy slower not to have another dps
[6:35:26] kennycuban: jb thoughts on playing with aug on tyranical/fortified weeks? if any
[6:35:32] flawlesslykun: sure tanks might them for survivability but idk
[6:36:06] flawlesslykun: also it depends on the dungeon i guess
[6:36:13] Kettos: Im trying to go hard this week, I deplete all keys on last boss, so frustrating

[6:38:28] crpz666: As a healer, what do you feel are the pros and cons of having a blood dk tanking high keys?
[6:38:39] suinetel: Opinion if next week Fortified, Incorporeal, Sanguine is gonna be easier than this week?  Feels like tyrannical, bolstering is just aids.

[6:40:19] suinetel: Like TOTT third boss and DOTI dungeons are just nightmare surviving game this week.
[6:40:34] IsaureTV: lots of classes have a lot of utility to help with sanguine
[6:40:39] Tfos: if he doesnt kite properly u will not have enough knock backs
[6:40:53] kennycuban: I like incorporeal affix to do MC on my disc SeemsGood

[6:43:34] flowerpwrxd: do you miss the old days when we only needed to push on one week? not both fort and tyran weeks
[6:43:38] Holyjk: hi, are you on an mdi team, or just pull high keys for fun
[6:43:53] Whitewolf1441: dam so early
[6:44:07] Tfos: maybe some MW?
[6:44:29] Whitewolf1441: last question jb, how come you never do your own key?
