[1:19:37] qball79: I have a random question for you sir.. I have lost my physical authenticator... is there anything i can do to recover my account?
[1:20:09] Cowardpatty: @qball79  That's really a question for Blizzard technicall/customer support.
[1:20:12] ScarfaceBA: The dragonclass did get nerfed quite abit recently i hear
[1:20:17] phailquail: they do that every new class
[1:20:19] doubled09: Ive been hearing the new healer is not looking like its gonna be OP
[1:20:24] Cowardpatty: You'll probably have to send a photo of your drive's license
[1:20:27] xigzo92: payoR payoR payoR
[1:20:29] qball79: yeah, figured i would ask haha
[1:20:32] Elwhappo: you can select sms and verify with your phone @qball79
[1:20:38] whos_dayglo: they wont nerf the new class till the NEXT expansion LUL
[1:20:41] djexxc: but necromancers? when?! XD
[1:20:49] ScarfaceBA: I feel like its going to be squishy
[1:20:50] Yazkir: My biggest complaint with Wrath so far is just the rush all the guilds have. Like, every recruiting guild is like pre-raid BiS by Thursday. Second 80 toon within two weeks.   Like, we don't have to be sweaty and smash this content in 2 seconds. lol

[1:21:27] doubled09: Cdew has been playing the healer and he doesnt seem confident they are gonna be great. I read an article saying they are being set up for failure so we'll see
[1:21:31] djexxc: now they need a necromancer which is gonna be cloth
[1:21:37] DrGreenBuzz: @Yazkir agreed
[1:21:38] Grouwdi: Hope Cata isn't next release (that's when WoW hurt)
[1:21:38] NodeMonkey: it's SCALE-MALE
[1:21:44] Knaxxis: they made it 30 lol
[1:21:47] Cowardpatty: 30 now
[1:21:48] Tadru1: have levelled a dragon on beta to lvl 75 and sry to say it doesnot feel OP at all so far.
[1:21:48] Knaxxis: ppl arent up to date
[1:21:49] gullf1sk: What i think is gonna surprise a lot of people is how mindnumbingly and stupidly easy wotlk content is because the marketers took over at blizzard with this expansion
[1:21:58] ScarfaceBA: @Grouwdi No one really knows. Thats whast turns me off from Wrath atm tbh
[1:22:08] Bennity: aren't heals meant to be 40?
[1:22:12] Cowardpatty: They want them to have moderate range with high mobility so they have to move around to heal
[1:22:20] qball79: hmm might work, ill give that a whirl thank you. hopefully its on my current number..
[1:22:24] ScarfaceBA: Like theres plenty i could be getting on with retail to prepare for dragonflight. as i didnt play through shadowlands
[1:22:32] doubled09: @gullf1sk I can already tell their is a huge difference in how hard it seemed then and how easy it seems now lol
[1:22:49] Cowardpatty: Yeah, like these new talent systems
[1:22:53] djexxc: lol like classic right?
[1:22:56] gullf1sk: yep
[1:23:06] Cowardpatty: I'll have less abilities at 70 in the next expansion than I do right now in SL
[1:23:11] ScarfaceBA: Yeah thats what turns me off from wrath is. If it ends up going to cata next i'll just quit classic.
[1:23:12] gullf1sk: wrath heroics are as hard as level 70 normal tbc dungeons
[1:23:12] xigzo92: yep blizzard so lazy tbh
[1:23:21] ScarfaceBA: they need to do something new maybe a new timeline
[1:23:22] Tadru1: i think that especially in pvp arena the healer is in a big disadvantage
[1:23:26] Coldstyx: Blizzard so gracious, ty Blizz KEKW
[1:23:27] AllenzoTV: @gullf1sk the fun part is gearing u characters, and playing the game.
[1:23:30] djexxc: healing breath!
[1:23:46] djexxc: lol
[1:23:52] doubled09: @gullf1sk I was watching Pika kill the bosses in UP in like 10 seconds
[1:24:03] Cowardpatty: John, they buffed Shadow Shoo-Shoo
[1:24:20] gullf1sk: yeah they can be done with level 77 characters with easse
[1:24:56] Tadru1: there is no talent to increase range and blizzard already said they will not increase the rsnge
