[0:45:37] BlinkApx: we need to look at the mages since i play mage
[0:45:39] plowgod: id be happy with heroic leap or bladestorm tbh
[0:45:41] CCsupression: You want like Herioc leap and stuff right mate :D?
[0:45:46] rickyross_gg: I fully support warrior nerfs
[0:45:52] jimbonni: No one cars about pve bru
[0:45:54] Sp00kedEu: @sonii if u could add any 2 war ability’s what would they be
[0:45:55] uhvie: no heroic leap thats awful
[0:45:55] yoCoded: are you drinking fuckin eggs rn?
[0:45:55] karatehobo: its about helicoptering you wang around the room and shooting ropes
[0:45:56] jimbonni: PVP ANDys
[0:45:57] Fetch22: remember when they added "flashy" titans grip it ruined warriors for me
[0:46:00] bubsenseii: blade storm would amazing
[0:46:02] kaizerlight: What??
[0:46:07] Genghjs: Doesnt fit classic combat
[0:46:10] yoCoded: ohh it’s a lemon LUL LUL
[0:46:11] izsaktu: Warrior needs something cool like how rogue got the throwing aoe
[0:46:13] BlinkApx: zesty
[0:46:13] CCsupression: Id actually say Bladestorm and Herioc leap would be fine on Warriors aslong as its scaled nice :) So it dosnt destroy everything :p
[0:46:15] ani_kage: thats a lot of lemon!
[0:46:17] darkh0rst: heroic leap and when u kill someone the cd resets
[0:46:18] brownfiesta: Majority of people only look at Warriors from a Pve prospective and thats why warriors dont get flashy stuff
[0:46:22] zephyr_inc: the warrior runes dont change enough of the gameplay or offer crazy unique builds like the other classes it just feels like more of the same
[0:46:22] Kazzator: Are you teeth immune for that? :P
[0:46:35] maxiebeee: DoEsNt FiT ClaSsIc ComBaT
[0:46:35] CCsupression: Guys, If Rouges can get Shadowstep warriors can get Herioc leap dont you agree on that?
[0:46:43] ogMansoN: honestly id rather just get solo'd by a hunter pet for all 4 phases
[0:46:50] AndersbergDK: Warlocks can get Meta form in classic, but warriors can not get anything flashy or "out of place" that's just fun to press
[0:46:59] kigami_uro: still want second wind
[0:47:03] BlinkApx: i have a theory, what if the classic dev team just dont like warriors

[1:14:08] EasyPeasley: I'd rather not spend 1000 gold every week at lvl 60 like classic era, fuck GDKP
[1:14:13] Zagecsss: its all RWT'rs now doing GDKP's
[1:14:16] Kapers_: @SONII realistically, how are they gonna police it? They cant control bots at all
[1:14:17] halfpassion: Ok sonnii explain what you going to do in p2 with your WARRIOR
[1:14:22] malvarcla: thoughts on kegels?
[1:14:25] hajanatorator: we hate gdkp cuz we have no golds :D
[1:14:28] xlineagefreek: how are they removing GDKP i missed that
[1:14:31] vepsee: can’t wait to ruin the AH with my useless gold now lma
[1:14:33] TobyNova: It seems like GDKPs are bad because you can buy gold, not because of the actual way GDKPs are run imo according to that reddit post anyway
[1:14:33] vepsee: lmao
[1:14:34] imgonnakaratefightyou: They become mandatory.
[1:14:37] Markusdaffu: Do you think they will make it like retail where ppl pay a fixed price before the raid start?
[1:14:42] limburgse: only goldbuyers like gdkps
[1:14:48] don_kneee: punish players instead of getting rid of the bots but k
[1:14:50] Immortalizz02: Fuck paying for gear

[1:15:01] TobyNova: but yeh there is no way Blizz can get rid of gold buying
[1:15:03] Joseph_Kel: can’t believe it’s been 35 months honestly.
[1:15:06] vepsee: people will buy gold for anything
[1:15:08] Toppers25: I’m non-RMT and enjoy it
[1:15:08] Zagecsss: Yeh if their wasnt RMT then GDKP wouldnt be a problem
[1:15:11] ZefyrSSF: i mean invocation*
[1:15:24] ZefyrSSF: but also synergy
[1:15:24] AZxStove: gdkp lovers are just gonna make a discord and do it anyway lol
[1:15:36] Toppers25: yea it’s not going anywhere.
[1:15:36] spike82q: at 60 ilse of Quel'danas   daily quest  or something simmilar at 60?
[1:15:40] Astralthundr: also bleh
[1:15:46] assrug: it's the dmg of the full dot, it's not bad
[1:15:48] jschroe3: better than the other two
[1:15:53] Markusdaffu: If there were no bots that overrun the market the gdkp's wouldn't be a problem
[1:16:02] uhvie: invocation got changed so it finishes the last 6 seconds of the dot
[1:16:05] Bidsee: The gdkp stance just feels so self serving to me rather than "for the community"
[1:16:06] ObrezKnight: I hated gdkps because I had no gold, so I started farming and started going to gdkps, picking up items I couldn't get before or getting gold, now I'm at 300+ gold and BIS. Blizzard just admitting to being completely incompetent not being able to stop gold selling, I guess pulling gdkp is good
[1:16:08] Shepp22: I’m gonna have these things called “Dragon” coins you can buy with gold. these dragon coins can be redeemed for gear in my DKP runs.
[1:16:22] Astralthundr: Soul Link + Meta is all im looking forward to with Warlock lol
[1:16:25] Apexx9011: xD
[1:16:31] AZxStove: they got Meta they can’t get anymore cool shit
[1:16:34] EasyPeasley: @ObrezKnight youre the outlier not the norm, thats why
[1:16:51] Bidsee: blizzzards
[1:16:56] ObrezKnight: @EasyPeasley true, but maybe punish the shit out of gold buyers
[1:17:02] jschroe3: Locks get DemonHunter immolation aura. POG

[1:27:22] aequitas987: the QOL stuff is cool, i'm alittle worried at 50 or 60 players will be so OP
[1:27:24] bahsingha: but how can some classes fall that much behind
[1:27:25] turpy_: predictions on what happens to chars after SoD?
[1:27:27] ohg33: Some people just always want to be negative. They don't understand that changing classes to entice people in to continuing to play and try new classes is the goal.
[1:27:35] erawin1990: sweet shirt sonii
[1:27:42] 12typhoon12: They balance it by making everything broken
[1:27:45] EasyPeasley: TBC SoD Pog

[1:32:11] pmanfit91: I like that they're giving specific enchanting for the raid, instead of bringing out new enchants that could be abused in PvP.
[1:32:12] aequitas987: random OP shit on long CD feels very vanilla
[1:32:25] Bidsee: TLDR PLEASE LOL

[1:45:26] gabread__: you should seriously look at the plate set compared to the leather set its such a joke man
[1:45:28] Phav: Simonize. it’s about a proposed alternate loot system. interesting but they probably won’t listen to him

[1:51:36] MajinTV: im pissed i quit sod for it
[1:51:38] Shepp22: I’m selling “dragon” coins, which can be bought with gold and redeemed in my DKP raid for gear
[1:51:39] zephyr_inc: hopefully itll keep the gold inflation down
[1:51:40] gabread__: im glad theyre testing it at least, but i did enjoy gdkps
[1:51:42] ryufromstreets6: gdkps are nice for non-gold buyers, but it's still gold that's RMT'd/botted
[1:51:44] ALjalladTv: we have in game "detection" LUL imagine believing that shit
[1:51:48] FreddiFish07: gold buyers pissed
[1:51:51] joonelius3: its a big L I have 9 characters and I can grind gold for alts with my alt bots.
[1:51:55] wcked07: SR is a waste of time when most the loot table is trash, at least you get a payout with gdkp
[1:52:12] EasyPeasley: Ahmpy is in shambles, hasnt streamed since the announcement, prolly fell into a deep depression
[1:52:15] gabread__: has the potential to crash the raiding population
[1:52:15] joonelius3: I also have gathered lot of gold with gdkps on my bis chara and its all invalitaded now.
[1:52:16] st0neh: @ALjalladTv Yeah it's very difficult to detect "GDKP" text strings FailFish
[1:52:16] bahsingha: finally they did something.... but GDKP is not the problem! for real! the problem in SoD are the goldfarming bots
[1:52:17] Dracksar: GDKP is kinda wack for 10 man raid anyway
[1:52:18] Immortalizz02: Imagine paying your way to the end of a video game
[1:52:20] erawin1990: u can still offer gold to buy someones shit in like a MS/OS run
[1:52:21] cbrodeur6: Shadow looking tasty
[1:52:25] gabread__: @EasyPeasley cmon man thats not even true
[1:52:26] erawin1990: just no sanctioned gdkp
[1:52:35] ZackorTV: GDKP pro : Gets gold/consumes even if you dont get loot/need loot...Can buy 80% of gear for cheap... Cons: Wont get BIS rare loot without overpaying/buying g.
[1:52:38] TheBarehand: Ironically not having a gdkp is kinda pushing me to buy gold since that was how I made gold from scratch XD
[1:52:40] uhvie: i hate this update i just bought 10000 gold preparing for gnomer  and they took away my gdkps :(
[1:52:42] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:52:50] Rapapep: GDKP would be fine in a vacuume where it didnt fuck up every other aspect of the game.
[1:52:54] Dracksar: there is no bidding competition in 10 man or a lot less
[1:53:03] Immortalizz02: @TheBarehand Why do you have to buy it

[4:21:20] Dklosterhoff: Gotta have fruit and vegetables
[4:21:51] st0neh: Imagine seeing a recommended foods list for a new diet @SONII and it said "$50 of taco bell" as a suggested meal
[4:21:52] iheartmywife: went full animal based last january. Was cool but I definitely feel better eating solid veggies. If I could afford to not have to eat $3/lb chicken and 1$/dz eggs or afford raw dairy I'd do it.

[4:31:31] ponderouzbeast: so you dont do legs?
[4:31:33] st0neh: Today's Sesame Street was brought to you by the letters BPC and the number 157
[4:31:33] veiloflonelystars: being healthy and balanced is more important

[4:36:30] MysoreMango: (Jk hit legs guys)
[4:36:38] erawin1990: well no ur heart rate goes up because ur body is demanding more blood supply
[4:36:41] Thundacles: 190 makes my chest hurt and i dont want to go any higher
[4:36:45] erawin1990: ur muscles r needing it to function
[4:36:54] erawin1990: sending signals to ur heart to pump more
[4:37:02] drvichyssoise: @kief770 what happens if u do that tho
