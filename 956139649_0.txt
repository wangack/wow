[0:39:31] thetrumenshow: feral tank is good in tbc, but dungeons suck to tank with pug dps.
[0:39:35] Darzetti_: agreed
[0:39:38] KAHVITEK: Should i start leveling fresh toon now or wait for prepatch?
[0:39:39] shrektard69: yes
[0:39:41] Unspoken: that looks awesome
[0:39:45] thetrumenshow: @PGTrim
[0:39:47] Xerothrone: Id download some hotcakes
[0:40:13] Luxthos: My issue with Classic was that I didn't have access to a PTR or Test server to create the WeakAuras with a template 60 characters
[0:40:17] Meakis: classic is basic stuff like "Ability X is comming in, deal wiith it"
[0:40:21] TwoFacedFlan: you got me leveling my druid. a lot of fun!
[0:40:21] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue

[0:40:40] Rayman_1990: @KahviGG I personally w8ing  for prepatch,  but I am going to make BE
[0:40:44] Mitune: i think shaman would be even faster to level in prepatch at least cause I think they get the dual wield relatively early
[0:40:48] Meakis: Now it is X Y Z W is commining in, move, dps heal yourself and don't move
[0:41:05] Vexxsis: Was watching Max dood play Pso New Genesis, game looks super fun
[0:41:12] Rayman_1990: prepatch leveling should be quite fun I believe
[0:41:28] shrektard69: im elveling rn bc im a slow mofo
[0:41:30] Vexxsis: evening @towelliee
[0:41:48] thetrumenshow: prepatch lvling will be great since all the people will be lvling again and talents to let people play more than 1 spec and be able to lvl
[0:41:49] Luxthos: Some classes are pretty complicated, since they aren't split anymore like in Retail, I have to account for every single build from talents etc... It gets pretty insane!
[0:42:02] Vexxsis: the remake looks godly
[0:43:00] Meakis: would you think they would actually look back tto old mmo's to learn from for new mmo's ?  A lot of hard work and mysterie is missing from current wow as example
[0:43:15] Meakis: if any mmo'  is being made
[0:43:27] Luxthos: Fucking Augment Runes hahaha
[0:43:39] Vexxsis: @towelliee  damn your gonna hit up Shadowbringers...poggers

[1:55:44] ryurax: That's just how it is, people don't really understand how businesses work
[1:55:47] TheEnstraynomic: CEOs wouldn't be earning millions in a socialist country, because that money would be confiscated and re-distributed to the actual poor
[1:55:50] metavahn231: ceo giving himself money LUL
[1:55:57] Vexxsis: after the furloughed happen obviously was on unemployment for 6 months then was let go from the company
[1:56:17] ryurax: Rich people wouldn\t live in a communist country
[1:56:19] Vexxsis: been on unemployment since then
[1:56:24] ryurax: That's literally communism
[1:56:35] pacokoi: I think the outrage for the layoffs of customer service positions awhile back was warranted especially given their record profits. Eports not so much
[1:56:49] ryurax: But you can try to go there, let me know how it works out for you...
[1:57:08] pacokoi: Surprised they didnt cut funding to esports sooner. Who the fuck watches OW league?

[1:58:02] bruhSit_farmer: ouch
[1:58:09] Alegnowar: the whole selling points of the OWL for investors were homestands, but now they cut them off
[1:58:10] bruhSit_farmer: that bad aye
[1:58:12] Quimby54: @Vexxsis they also got 3 months severance and 12 months health care. alot of people seem to cut that out
[1:58:19] pacokoi: Is 10k youtube and twitch tho? They stream on both
[1:58:30] bruhSit_farmer: @Quimby54 correct
[1:58:40] Lokajin: @Quimby54 thats a pretty standard and generous severance package to be fair..
[1:58:43] Vexxsis: @quimby54 still who wants a 200 gift card to just here store c'mon
[1:59:02] bruhSit_farmer: i mean its a bonus, unemployed alot of time to play blizz games :P
[1:59:26] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee is MDI done? no more?
[1:59:27] Alegnowar: they got they're money selling out to youtube

[1:59:32] Jay_rb: LoL and dota are prob the only games getting return on investment atm
[1:59:43] pronkk_: mdi sucks and is toxic to normal key scene
[1:59:54] Spaede: It’s a bummer to AWC is good content, being on YT stinks
[1:59:56] TJAB0: Why do you level to "just" level 50 ?
[2:00:01] Vexxsis: @2makeme lol ikr
[2:00:18] FranciscoTheMage: I blame the esports disaster on moving the thing to YouTube
[2:00:21] Quimby54: if mdi goes, hopefully their current dungeon design goes too. not very fun having mechanics on mobs on top of affixes
[2:00:21] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee
[2:00:41] Lokajin: ya the youtube move was pretty yikes
[2:01:29] 2MakeMe: @Vexxsis like that was me, id be fukin triggered.. i wouldnt even want to see blizzard

[2:13:37] Vexxsis: @darzetti_ waiting myself also
[2:13:43] Lokajin: You wont see survival as a spec till late T5 content anyways survival needs a fuck ton of agility before its even remotely viable to bring.
[2:14:10] Jay_rb: I remember not knowing anything in Kara as a BM hunter and still doing good damage KEKW
[2:14:11] swampt1l: what questing addons should i have for classic?

[2:16:03] chaoticaptain: Warlocks were awsome back in TBC, shadowbolt spam lol
[2:16:21] Vanhoek: we are making a full druid riad group
[2:16:22] canee43: is that a XP addon on top?
[2:16:23] swampt1l: @Jay_rb to get to 60?

[2:16:43] Lokajin: or you can be that special cookie and be a fire lock ;P
[2:16:49] Lokajin: incinerate spam for the meme
[2:16:51] Jay_rb: @SwapT1_ In general it takes almost a week playtime to get to 60 depending on how hard you go.
[2:16:59] pacokoi: 4 and 4 is hella sweaty LUL
[2:17:06] realdevv: You want 1 affli and 1 survival though, especially survival.
[2:17:14] brain_wash: Punt
[2:17:20] realdevv: Survival buffs the entire raid with attack power equal to 25% of that hunters agility.
[2:17:34] swampt1l: wait how do you download on curseforge for classic addons @Jay_rb
[2:17:54] Jay_rb: @SwapT1_ Do you have classic downloaded?
[2:17:59] Vexxsis: it's nice alliance is getting seal of blood on pallys

[2:19:44] Deadly_Emily: hi ROWLIE
[2:20:14] trinita289: meh alredy see all disc priests in arena
[2:20:15] realdevv: @capcrucnh A good retri pally is very good, our retri is arguably the best ret in the TBC private server scene, he pushes 2k+ DPS in t4/t5, wich is top 5 dps on some fights.
[2:20:16] Deadly_Emily: I mean towlie
[2:20:31] Vexxsis: @capcrucnh idk there was some really good rets back then I'm TBC but they don't get on steroids till right before wrath
[2:20:32] anOceaninadrop: delete those pages?

[2:21:18] Thaidon37: going to order GFuel for the first time.  What flavors are good?  See lots are sold out.
[2:21:27] Vexxsis: I think there worse in pvp imo in tbc
[2:21:29] TwoFacedFlan: @swapt1_ I had to have curseforge search my system for game client. Worked for me.
[2:21:43] Vanhoek: @realdevv what are boomies pushing?
[2:21:44] Jay_rb: @SwapT1_ Maybe scan for games, click the three dots right of run game.
[2:21:51] Deadly_Emily: do u smoke
[2:22:08] realdevv: @vanhoek A good boomkin can be competetive on some fights, but they need to tryhard alot with dark runes for mana.
[2:22:12] Deadly_Emily: a
[2:22:18] Jay_rb: VapeNation bruh
[2:22:34] Deadly_Emily: do u smoke weed??
[2:22:37] Vexxsis: but to be fair all the classes in tbc are way more viable vs classic
[2:22:41] swampt1l: ooo i got but default ui looks so huge compared to retail LOL @Jay_rb
[2:22:41] Vanhoek: @realdevv ah gotcha im more then likely gonna go feral till 70 than go heals
[2:22:47] Deadly_Emily: yes or no
[2:22:55] Vanhoek: @realdevv cant beat treeform
[2:22:59] raymond3195: weed bad for you
[2:23:06] Deadly_Emily: iar
[2:23:11] pacokoi: a little dab while playing some wow is chill
[2:23:13] realdevv: @vanhoek Ferals are good tanks, if you want to DPS its still powershifting with the lvl 40 helmet.

[2:28:58] LiveFromStua: 26 - 14 - 1 Pages of stv
[2:29:07] realdevv: @Xumate Loads of people leveling and doing raids/dungeons to prepp on Gehennas in EU atleast
[2:29:15] Xumate: @Vexxsis How long do you think prepatch will last?
[2:29:24] LiveFromStua: Rigged Kappa
[2:29:45] Vexxsis: @xumate  atm we don't know
[2:29:48] havardel: Good morning towelliee
[2:29:59] realdevv: I would be surprised if prepatch is longer than 2-4 weeks.
[2:30:01] realdevv: Prepp now.
[2:30:15] Rayman_1990: @Xumate I am sure long enough to level to 60
[2:30:17] Vexxsis: @realdevv longer dude
[2:30:18] breakthrutv: has tbc release date been announced yet?
[2:30:19] Xumate: That's my worry
[2:30:29] pacokoi: At least a month since theyre giving the races with pre patch
[2:30:42] Vanhoek: You think they gonna break and give us dual spec?
[2:30:51] realdevv: When prepatch is out do you really want to waste time leveling, when you can do bg's and buy R14 gear to level with.
[2:30:51] Vexxsis: @xumate unless you wanna be a Belf or space goat go ahead and start
[2:31:22] Rayman_1990: @realdevv some ppl want to play new races tho
[2:31:37] realdevv: Yeah sure, but otherwise i would get 60 before prepatch
[2:31:41] pacokoi: dual spec pleaseeee
[2:31:44] realdevv: So i could get R14 weps etc
[2:31:53] Vexxsis: hands down 100% dual spec
[2:31:57] Xumate: I see, thanks for all the answers
[2:32:03] 2MakeMe: dual spec would be nice tbh

[2:33:26] Clicklesly: At least i'm assuming prepatch will be the usual expansion build but with cap not removed yet
[2:33:28] Vexxsis: yeah dual spec everyone benefits
[2:33:28] realdevv: When BC is out JC mats is gonna be so expensive.
[2:33:37] bruhSit_farmer: thank god for tbc aye imagine just sitting waiting for 9.1
[2:33:37] Mitune: Will there be paid server transfers?
[2:33:54] realdevv: @Towelliee How expensive are Blue Sapphire on your server? JC needs 40x to reach 300.

[2:36:46] realdevv: They nerfed it by like 20-30%
[2:36:49] Richton867: 14
[2:37:14] partyanimalstone: aight sounds good
[2:37:31] 2MakeMe: straight up no lore lvl
[2:37:35] gentlemannnnnnnnn: Do you really need the gear to start in TBC. I started with dungeon gear at the original launch. Why bother? I would just farm resources for JC and I am done.
[2:37:38] pokerigo: is the druid lvl 60?

[2:49:41] Mezukage: BC = you have to earn to play current content(heroics and raids)
[2:49:50] instant_savage: he took no money
[2:49:59] frankiewawa: he turned down bigger money supposedly. good on him
[2:50:10] Vexxsis: @mezukage  exactly you gotta run those heroics for gear and the badges
[2:50:13] gentlemannnnnnnnn: And it was still the era where certain gear attained was impressive.
[2:50:17] Vexxsis: yeah
[2:50:20] 2MakeMe: yep
[2:50:28] kamisengames: Pallys will have 2
[2:50:30] 2MakeMe: its more like a misdirect tauint

[2:52:16] realdevv: @Mezukage For T5 yes, you can do kara/gruul/mag without doing a single heroic. Only Nighbane requires Thrallmar/Lower City Heroics.

[3:47:40] evilmech: about 5 old old games that dont work ,lol
[3:47:52] SpectraBG: @Towelliee I think you can just insert the disc and there's both the ps4 and ps5 version and I'm pretty sure you can select which one, because at the beginning it launched the ps4 version and not the ps5 and you had to manually select it to launch the ps5 version
[3:48:22] feherlofia123: i read somewhere u can

[3:59:33] Jawis: just wait another 10 years, so you can play a game
[3:59:34] jamarky23: @Jesperoni You also believe in illuminati and corona is fake? LUL

[4:17:41] HarleyB0t: @minael it is free before Level 60 and 2nd Expansion, why don't you try it yourself?
[4:17:45] ZIKERZ: in a couple months
[4:17:46] metavahn231: looks like youre with other nubs
[4:17:50] jamarky23: nah ff players are so chill when you tank tbh
[4:17:50] Alienfromger: chill music
[4:18:01] Vexxsis: peeping means just aggro
[4:18:03] Noshpan: FF players are usually chill
[4:18:09] Vexxsis: beeping*
[4:18:14] corvu__: Never played FF. @Towelliee do you recommend it ? I like pvp  most
[4:18:15] Noshpan: That noise means that they're aggro'd on you
[4:18:20] DocsMistake: the beep tells when an add targets you
[4:18:22] minael1: i see it for 1st time, now, here in towelliee channel. had no clue about anything. just that it looks anime. thats why i asked
[4:18:31] ryderthewriter: t
[4:18:45] ZIKERZ: i still did not get mt
[4:18:50] Vexxsis: @vsaraki  pvp isn't great but it's changing in next expansion
[4:18:53] Alaquane: requries level 72
[4:18:56] DocsMistake: you are level synced down, you are too low level
[4:18:56] Sandman_88: sync
[4:18:58] stratiss: you're scaled to level 50 rn i think
[4:18:59] Noshpan: @Vsaraki I recommend giving the free trial a shot, but FFXIV doesn't have a big pvp scene
[4:19:00] evilmech: lvl locked
[4:19:03] Alaquane: because you're down leveled in a dungeon, you don't get those abilities
[4:19:06] metavahn231: you are being GATEKEEPED
[4:19:07] okVes: you're level-synced to a lower level
[4:19:07] r3crutr: This is not a big pull <3
[4:19:07] remedyt: youre scaled to 50
[4:19:10] corvu__: @Vexxsis when is that coming?
[4:19:12] ryderthewriter: you are scared to 50 atm
[4:19:15] Vexxsis: @towelliee  your lvl has been scaled
[4:19:19] ryderthewriter: sacled*
[4:19:21] ryderthewriter: scaled*
[4:19:28] ZIKERZ: dam man
[4:19:31] Vexxsis: @vsaraki fall this year
[4:19:32] L4dy_Renegade: FF players if you're new and don't know how to do a boss mechanic, they'll just say " No worries, you do it like this " I don't think i've ever had anyone in a dungeon be even remotely rude.
[4:20:02] ZIKERZ: im lvl 78
[4:20:07] ZIKERZ: almost doen with my msq
[4:20:15] Noshpan: If you're a new FF player, don't be afraid to ask how to do something. Most will help you.
[4:20:15] Vexxsis: @vsaraki pvp isn' bad, but it's worth it for transmogs and stuff
[4:20:20] metavahn231: they mostly just fall over
[4:20:27] ZIKERZ: yeah new dungeosn emans new boss mechaics
[4:20:41] L4dy_Renegade: Glamour is the real end game in FFXIV.
[4:20:43] Sandman_88: PvP = Bursting
[4:20:45] gHOsTa81: 2,5sec gcd on every skill is a real downer in ff14 for me
[4:21:08] Vexxsis: Represent Exodus here
[4:21:08] MrGattz: once you hit level 40 that gcd kinda doesnt matter anymore
[4:21:21] Killsign: I always try to get into this game, but I really do not like the early leveling :P
[4:21:22] MrGattz: before 40 its slow af
[4:21:23] Reap14: The 2.5s gcd is there for a reason. The game is designed for ogcd usage.
[4:21:23] rhsiuol: this game looks like a light show
[4:21:25] stratiss: Yeah you get a lot of off gcd stuff
[4:21:29] Noshpan: Leviathan here!
[4:21:41] Reap14: You can turn off all effects @rhsiuol
[4:21:47] evilmech: at least every class now gets abilities off the global cooldown
[4:21:47] ZIKERZ: im gona be lvling a darksnight tank after getting my black mage to lvl 80
[4:21:49] Sandman_88: kill belly with someone gets sucked in
[4:21:56] Eggz1004: dont let the boss kill you
[4:22:06] Chrisfo79: Bring boss' health to zero
[4:22:10] rhsiuol: @Reap14 can I just tone them down a bit?
[4:22:14] Arkiel_: @Chrisfo79 EZ
[4:22:20] ZIKERZ: attack the boss  belly when he pulls soemeone in
[4:22:23] Reap14: @rhsiuol Yea you can turn it down or off
[4:22:27] Vexxsis: @rhsiuol yes
[4:22:35] rhsiuol: I see thanks
[4:22:37] shrektard69: this game looks interesting
[4:23:06] Alaquane: damage meters against TOS
[4:23:06] Arkiel_: its downloadable
[4:23:06] Vexxsis: no
[4:23:10] Arkiel_: called ACT
[4:23:16] TheUnknowing: No damage meters in game
[4:23:17] Vexxsis: your in a 50 dungeon
[4:23:17] pavepawns: anything interesting on final fantasy since you playing it atm?
[4:23:17] Darquesoul: the red numbers
[4:23:18] metavahn231: -750
[4:23:18] Khirae: it can't be an upgrade
[4:23:20] ryderthewriter: lolno everything is scaled to 50
[4:23:24] stratiss: LUL
[4:23:28] Darquesoul: use it for transmog
[4:23:28] Reap14: Its a 50 dungeon so the gear drops will be garbage for you @Towelliee
[4:23:30] ZIKERZ: if the stats ar red its trash for you
[4:23:34] stratiss: right click item compare
[4:23:34] evilmech: see the red number showing a neg in brackets
[4:23:44] ZIKERZ: its lvl 50 gear yur 74
[4:23:45] Noshpan: @shrektard69 Give the free trial a shot. Only thing you'll be out is time
[4:23:49] Eggz1004: dmg meters are against tos i think, but some people still try to download the mod for it
[4:23:49] Vexxsis: yeah you in a low lvl dungeon compared to your actual lvl
[4:23:56] shrektard69: i like the music
[4:24:02] evilmech: ACT is bannable
[4:24:04] metavahn231: soon you can do 3 pulls
[4:24:19] Noshpan: Harassing people with damage meters is bannable.
[4:24:20] Vexxsis: @eggz1004  it's against tos but devs don't mind it
[4:24:22] Deadly_Emily: classic musical
[4:24:28] NovaNax: Dmg meeters are only against toz if you start yelling out in chat that ppl are doing bad dmg and that your using a dmg meeter
[4:24:45] Sandman_88: ARR
[4:24:48] TheUnknowing: this was a realm reborn
[4:24:48] Alaquane: I think it was optional
[4:24:49] ryderthewriter: a realm reborn
[4:24:50] metavahn231: you can parse you just cant talk about other peoples parse or then you get banned lol
[4:24:53] Aliceisdead_: @Towelliee u can get a damage meter called act but its against tos but everyone that raids have it

[4:25:04] Vexxsis: same as Gshade Wich is amazing
[4:25:05] Reap14: Parser is bannable if you publicly shame someone and they report you..if you keep your mouth shut its fine
[4:25:06] ZIKERZ: the first time game relased
[4:25:09] evilmech: its not required for story progression
[4:25:21] ZIKERZ: is the dungoen yur o
[4:25:21] remedyt: @Vexxsis they dont mind it but if you kick or flame people for low dmg you can get banned
[4:25:29] Sandman_88: last boss is dope
[4:25:35] Deadly_Emily: nice
[4:25:38] Vexxsis: @remedyt right
[4:25:40] ryderthewriter: i dont think towelie has the hard mode for the dungeon cus thats even more cancer with poison lol
[4:25:54] evilmech: if u get an achivement at last boss for mapping the realm it means its your 1st time

[4:26:35] metavahn231: i thought this was HW
[4:26:39] ia_jujo: @Vexxsis Yeah but in the end we end p kicking people for low damage without telling them why, then they harass us to know why we kick em and we can't tell them. Its not like its better XD
[4:26:43] Reap14: This is an optional dungeon so you could have skipped it in ARR
[4:26:44] NovaNax: poisoon aoe tell ranged too kill statues
[4:26:55] evilmech: alot of the hard mode dungeons and lvl 50 ones were xtra so most dont bother doin
[4:27:05] Deadly_Emily: im
[4:27:05] Alaquane: wiki says it released in patch 2.2, unlocks after completing MSQ of ARR
[4:27:12] Deadly_Emily: ..
[4:27:13] DocsMistake: it just puts out a small dot
[4:27:16] Vexxsis: @ia_jujo  I don't use it just Gshade
[4:27:34] Alaquane: so if you beat msq and went straight to heavensward probably skipped it
[4:27:40] Aliceisdead_: @ia_jujo yeah most the time ppl end up saying yeah u dont know the fight enough xD
[4:27:43] Vexxsis: this boss has a weird aggro table
[4:27:44] metavahn231: killed it
[4:28:02] Deadly_Emily: 🔥🔥🔥💪
[4:28:06] Vexxsis: little guy
[4:28:07] Alaquane: it's blind
[4:28:11] evilmech: dont forget to farm your trex mount :)
[4:28:14] Reap14: The boss attacks the person that killed the add
[4:28:15] Deadly_Emily: hahah
[4:28:15] DocsMistake: its aggro is based on who has that debuff
[4:28:16] Alaquane: I think it attack whoever has moth poop on it
[4:28:18] Noshpan: It has a special prey mechanic. The boss will start going after the person covered in the most "flakes"
[4:28:25] Vexxsis: kill add to get threat
[4:28:28] Sandman_88: debuff to get its aggro table
[4:28:42] Noshpan: Bascially, the boss doesn't have an aggro table
[4:28:54] Vexxsis: adds=aggro for boss
[4:29:00] Deadly_Emily: nice
[4:29:01] DocsMistake: you can mostly ignore the adds lol
[4:29:08] Alaquane: yeah, someone just limit breaked

[4:30:18] metavahn231: maybe do a trial roullete next
[4:30:25] pavepawns: these dungeons feel so weird
[4:30:26] Vexxsis: I like the fact low lvl dungeons can wipe you if you don't know some mechanics
[4:30:33] pavepawns: good but weird
[4:30:34] KingofMeccano: @Towelliee what level are you?

[4:31:10] ZIKERZ: rhis boss
[4:31:14] metavahn231: i pass on most of the dungeon loot because its just crap that fills up your bags

[4:31:40] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @lindalinx (warning)

[5:10:56] FluxedOver: XIV raiding is pretty laidback

[5:11:07] grayfarron: LUL
[5:11:09] Jeraiya2: LUL
[5:11:11] b_uor: I'm thinking about jumping back into SWTOR today
[5:11:18] Vexxsis: nope
[5:11:19] mett7: nope
[5:11:19] Alaquane: dps
[5:11:19] FluxedOver: you can go HC with it of course but you can get alot done with minimal hours
[5:11:20] grayfarron: No, melee dps
[5:11:21] MrGattz: dps
[5:11:22] Vexxsis: dps
[5:11:26] Ravoric: No one knows what it is yet
[5:11:28] FluxedOver: its melee DPS. probably uses a scythe
[5:11:28] grayfarron: They havent revealed what it is yet
[5:11:31] KaysaDiaz: we will know more in May
[5:11:32] Noshpan: DPS
[5:11:33] mett7: 4
[5:11:35] Vexxsis: 4
[5:11:36] Frank4LuLz: its not a computer
[5:11:38] FluxedOver: 4 tanks. PLD WAR DRK GNB
[5:11:39] zildrog: Gunbreaker
[5:11:41] Ravoric: Gunbreaker
[5:11:43] grayfarron: Gunbreaker

[5:11:43] padlee01: gunbreaker
[5:11:44] jamarky23: its gonna be a 2 handed hammer user
[5:11:54] Sandman_88: LUL
[5:11:56] Vexxsis: @jamarky23  nope
[5:11:57] grayfarron: Yes its good LUL
[5:11:58] jamarky23: oathkeeper
[5:12:01] KaysaDiaz: how are you liking FF14?
[5:12:02] Ravoric: Gunbreaker is really fun
[5:12:03] DemorianCale: Gunbreaker is super fun but Paladin's man
[5:12:05] Kalidin79: its fun af
[5:12:06] FluxedOver: Gunbreaker uses a gunblade and has probably the most complex dps rotation
[5:12:08] DemorianCale: They are built different
[5:12:11] mett7: PLD is main tank to go
[5:12:13] Noxryn: Rin Karigani plays Gunbreaker a fair bit
[5:12:20] FluxedOver: GNB is prob the best overall tank atm
[5:12:26] Sandman_88: ^
[5:12:27] Noxryn: he's a world race/high optimization sort
[5:12:27] grayfarron: PLD is strong right now though, GBR slaps tho
[5:12:30] Vexxsis: @jamarky23  Zenos is the new job class and it's not a hammer
[5:12:33] FluxedOver: PLD is the best OT
[5:12:41] Noshpan: Astes_ plays GNB when he is streaming raid
[5:12:49] Sandman_88: PLD in a really god spot
[5:12:55] lloyd_dono: all tanks are pretty balanced overall
[5:13:02] xristakios: gunbreaker has the most complex dps rotation of all tanks
[5:13:08] Alyzzi: pld is best off tank just because of some mechanics
[5:13:11] grayfarron: Gunbreaker is the tank that feels most like a melee DPS
[5:13:11] FluxedOver: the tanks are well balanced, its more about flavor and unique strengths
[5:13:12] KaysaDiaz: i think most people who main tank play them all
[5:13:24] FluxedOver: like dark knight having a shitty invuln LMAO
[5:13:26] Vexxsis: yeah PLD are pulling some pretty nasty dps
[5:13:54] grayfarron: @Towelliee  You may want to turn in sound to be localized to your camera and not your character, otherwise noises like that will keep scaring ya
[5:14:10] mett7: angy birb
[5:14:12] CADZtv: ????
[5:14:17] Vexxsis: yes
[5:14:23] FluxedOver: ye
[5:14:24] Alyzzi: yep
[5:14:26] Vexxsis: whirlwind
[5:14:27] jamarky23: @Vexxsis  visually and gameplay wise that wouldnt make sense considering to what there is already, why make another katana wielding class when they already have samurai? devs usually go for something fresh, so a 2 handed hammer user (oathbreaker) would make way more sense since it also fits the old lore of FF
[5:14:29] Sandman_88: @grayfarron thank you for that. I was trying to figure out why his stuff is so loud
[5:14:39] FluxedOver: ye now your melee can get uptime

[5:14:47] sniperpotion: What do y’all think is better gw2 or ff14?
[5:14:59] FluxedOver: oh oop
[5:15:00] FluxedOver: lol
[5:15:17] Vexxsis: @jamarky23  it's not a katana he broke his on purpose and state he wants a new weapon to fight the WoL
[5:15:26] CADZtv: gw2 a good casual mmo
[5:15:26] sniperpotion: @grayfarron both mmos though
[5:15:27] FluxedOver: its likely going to be a scythe

[5:15:48] Solidsteve88: Too late
[5:16:04] krajar96: !cam
[5:16:04] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while

[5:16:22] Kalidin79: you can stand right on the other side, u were just a little too late
[5:16:29] Vexxsis: and it's not a hammer, giving that Yoshi P wore a grim reaper shirt for a teaser on the melee job, most suspect its a scythe wielding one
[5:16:30] mett7: BLM like fck it, heal me! LUL
[5:16:32] jamarky23: @Vexxsis  Im gonna be right you know ;) so this conversation is over
[5:16:36] Queenjii: @krajar96 thanks!
[5:16:54] im_your_innerdemon: @FluxedOver how do you know that it will be a scythe?
[5:16:55] Solidsteve88: LUL
[5:17:00] Vexxsis: @jamarky23  ugh no everyone is saying it's not a hammer.
[5:17:02] krajar96: @Queenjii i got you bb
[5:17:12] Alaquane: this guy says thriving
[5:17:18] sniperpotion: @grayfarron gotcha I can agree wit that
[5:17:21] mett7: LUL wait for LB2
[5:17:25] FluxedOver: yoshiP wearing a grim reaper shirt mostly
[5:17:25] Kalidin79: this game puts respect on griffons, lookin good
[5:17:36] FluxedOver: also one of the bosses later in shb uses a scythe
[5:17:43] FluxedOver: so alot of the animations are in there
[5:17:43] jamarky23: @Vexxsis  So if everyone is saying jump of a tall building you will do it?
[5:17:46] Vexxsis: Zenos would not wield a slow ass hammer
[5:17:56] FluxedOver: daily roulettes are the way
[5:18:04] Ravoric: Daily roulettes are super buff exp
[5:18:06] Tessiuz: Love this song
[5:18:08] ShadoodHD: LA HEE
[5:18:11] FluxedOver: LA EE
[5:18:22] Vexxsis: @jamarky23  ughh no ass, but the clues are there for a scythe weapon
[5:18:38] ZIKERZ: this area song gets funny
[5:18:48] Vexxsis: @fluxedover  ty for the back info also
[5:18:48] jamarky23: @Vexxsis  Are you high? be honest
[5:19:03] Vexxsis: @jamarky23  I don't smoke

[5:19:50] ZIKERZ: sin eaters are hot
[5:20:01] Roxas_360: why is he playing ff14 ????, what happened to TBC beta ??? and next patch ?
[5:20:02] MrGattz: @grayfarron i have no idea why moobot hit you. hold on
[5:20:05] grayfarron: lmao cuz i said a T word
[5:20:05] shale93: I dont like the silent cut scenes in ff
[5:20:12] grayfarron: @MrGattz  Ex president
[5:20:14] SylvexDragonskin: cut scenes are part of the reason one plays ya know
[5:20:17] KirithRevos: NODDERS
[5:20:17] klindatu: they look like kyrian nightfae
[5:20:21] ShadoodHD: smash
[5:20:30] MrGattz: ohhh shit yeah your right i didnt even see that
[5:20:32] swampt1l: Your late to that @roxas_360
[5:20:40] jamarky23: La hee!
[5:20:46] grayfarron: @MrGattz  yeaaah i forgot it was banned here lmao, not even in that context
[5:20:51] DocsMistake: @Towelliee peace out for the night, enjoy FF14
[5:20:56] MrGattz: yeah i know im sorry about that
[5:21:04] Sathalan: @sylvexdragonskin you'd be surprised how many people are actually invested in the ff14 story bilvyySip
[5:21:05] sniperpotion: What was banned?
[5:21:06] grayfarron: @MrGattz  np dood ^^
[5:21:07] Vexxsis: it's a spell dmg ability
[5:21:08] FluxedOver: holy circle is your magic AOE ability
[5:21:16] Frank4LuLz: trummmmps, lol
[5:21:24] mmrghost7: nourooz mobarak
[5:21:27] Sandman_88: weaving
[5:21:28] sniperpotion: Oh lol
[5:21:28] Sandman_88: yeah
[5:21:28] FluxedOver: yeah gapclose
[5:21:34] ShadoodHD: story's worth it too... no spodles
[5:21:37] SylvexDragonskin: @Sathalan I know most ppl skip cut scenes but that's just their dumb choice :)
[5:21:42] FluxedOver: yeah they were the last tank to get one
[5:21:48] FluxedOver: never had it until SHB
[5:21:50] Sandman_88: much needed
[5:22:01] DocsMistake: yea all the tanks have some form of gap close now, it is so nice
[5:22:14] DreavT2K: dont forget to collect all wind items to fly Kappa
[5:22:16] Sathalan: @sylvexdragonskin most people I know don't do that eogWelp
[5:22:16] FluxedOver: but ye holy spirit is your AOE magic attack so if you have 3+ mobs and are in requiescat, you use that instead
[5:22:32] SylvexDragonskin: @Sathalan well you found some rare ones hehe
[5:22:32] FluxedOver: or wait shit holy circle? i dont remember
[5:22:32] DocsMistake: too bad pretty much all tanks just use gap close as extra DPS lol
[5:22:41] FluxedOver: it depends
[5:22:45] Noxryn: holy circle is the aoe one yeah
[5:22:45] grayfarron: So is the "long gcd" an issue for ya now you have more off globals to weave than ya know what to do with? :P @Towelliee
[5:23:02] FluxedOver: you use it for a DPS gain if you dont need it to gain GCDs using gapclose
[5:23:15] mett7: hahahha
[5:23:15] grayfarron: Nothing LUL
[5:23:18] FluxedOver: so its an optimization thing whether its better to use it or not
[5:23:23] mett7: baited
[5:23:47] zeychs: just tuning in, didn't know towelie was playing this. How's he liked the story so far?
[5:23:56] DocsMistake: there are very few fights there you absolutely have to save it usually the timing is good enough where you will have a gap close if you need it, unless you lose more than 2 GCDs it isnt worth spending
[5:24:23] DocsMistake: sprint and or just running is usually better lol
[5:24:24] Vexxsis: those 80 crits with Confiteor on PLD oof
[5:24:30] Vexxsis: 80k
[5:24:40] mett7: we close to 75 POGGERS
[5:24:42] FluxedOver: confiteor the blessing and the curse
[5:24:55] Vexxsis: lol
[5:25:01] FluxedOver: or i should say, the curse of high potency in this game
[5:25:21] Vexxsis: curious to see the stat squish coming
[5:25:23] zeychs: @Towelliee How you liking the story so far? That shit in ahm araeng caught me off guard
[5:25:24] anxietyrising: i mean, she is 16. they are all emo

[5:27:28] FluxedOver: sword oath is a buff applied by royal authority
[5:27:42] FluxedOver: so it becomes you do goring blade combo, then royal authority combo, then 3x atonement, back to goring blade
[5:27:44] DocsMistake: they changed tanks, there is no DPS stance and tank stance anymore, just tank stance
[5:27:47] Noshpan: There's no more stance dancy
[5:27:48] Kalidin79: only one stance now

[5:28:10] 2MakeMe: doubt it
[5:28:31] Vexxsis: yes
[5:28:36] FluxedOver: yep
[5:28:57] FluxedOver: pld works on a 1min rotation more or less
[5:28:57] Vexxsis: yeah PLD needs a skill prune
[5:29:02] TheUnknowing: ffxiv is a lot of buttons, even with the pruning lol
[5:29:08] FluxedOver: nah I think its fine
[5:29:12] FluxedOver: i think its totally acceptable
[5:29:21] ShadoodHD: dahkness towW
[5:29:25] Vexxsis: I feel like shield tron can be a trait under certain conditions

[5:35:21] FluxedOver: Ardbert
[5:35:21] Vexxsis: Derplander
[5:35:23] ryderthewriter: the warrior of light who failed the world
[5:35:23] MrStephie: Ardebert ya

[5:35:28] nixxy_7: Its a You inception of the you, from your dreams of the YOu... of yourse ... think?? cohhNotes cohhHmm cohhHmm
[5:35:32] zeychs: he was the opposite of you warrior of darkness on the source and light on the 1st
[5:35:44] Vexxsis: He's the original WoL from here
[5:35:50] TweakT: @filipmundo96 what's worse?
[5:35:59] grayfarron: @filipmundo96  Barely. They are very open about where the funding from the mogstation goes to, it bought the new servers alone.
[5:36:09] TheUnknowing: No she goes with you
[5:36:15] FluxedOver: mogstation is all very optional stuff
[5:36:25] cyou_787: cyou_787 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:36:27] hardstyletaco96: @tweakt they sell 10x the much content in ther store
[5:36:36] grayfarron: Atleast you know when you buy something off the mogstore its not lining executive pockets, its pumped directly into the game
[5:36:44] Kuro_Sj: LUL
[5:36:45] TweakT: well damn, wont try it then
[5:36:45] 無職提督: lol
[5:36:46] nixxy_7: Illidan wanted to say: you are not prepared :P
[5:36:48] TheUnknowing: ILLIDAN we are mourning
[5:36:54] Bogzeh: illidan cant read the room
[5:36:55] Kineticbomb: Nah man man he's just here to say they are prepared for it.
[5:37:03] PYRO_MANI8C: i just started playing star wars the old republic again to take a break from wow
[5:37:06] grayfarron: @TweakT  Its literally all appearance and most of it is just NPC costumes. Its not worse than WoW's
[5:37:20] Vexxsis: @angrec were only called wod cause we're bringing balance to the first form the access light
[5:37:24] FluxedOver: its appearance, unique mounts, race changes/level boosts
[5:37:43] nixxy_7: IN her chamers.. :O
[5:37:52] FluxedOver: the unique stuff from in game cannot be purchased
[5:37:57] TheUnknowing: FFXIV is cutscene simulator but atleast its good
[5:37:59] hardstyletaco96: @grayfarron yeah ofc ffxiv fans believe mtx are good
[5:37:59] FluxedOver: so there's no like, p2w or whatever
[5:38:01] metavahn231: please set aside some time
[5:38:02] nixxy_7: cohhGah We in boys in her chamber cohhEZ cohhEZ cohhMy cohhMy
[5:38:07] zeychs: @Vexxsis yeah but the wod is kinda not much more then a title, even ardbert says he called himself it just for a fancy
[5:38:13] Vexxsis: yes
[5:38:20] pheonixu: correct
[5:38:28] Vexxsis: @angrec correct
[5:38:29] TheUnknowing: You are helping them bring back the night
[5:38:36] Vexxsis: no
[5:38:37] FluxedOver: the ardbert guy did go to your world
[5:38:38] pheonixu: yea
[5:38:38] ryderthewriter: nope
[5:38:38] Kineticbomb: Light has become evil in this realm.
[5:38:39] TheUnknowing: not really
[5:38:41] FluxedOver: and was the warrior of darkness
[5:38:41] joon__joon: no
[5:38:43] ryderthewriter: ardbert died my dude
[5:38:43] grayfarron: @filipmundo96 No... we dont, we just wont lie and say its worse than WoW's because they arent throwing 6month sub fairy outfits at you.
[5:38:44] NookDavos: LUL
[5:38:45] TheUnknowing: cause your world isnt fucked like this lol
[5:38:45] Havykk: huh?
[5:38:56] metavahn231: thats a story for another time
[5:38:59] TheUnknowing: technically but also he is dead lol
[5:38:59] joon__joon: yes if we had the same issue with light
[5:38:59] Alyzzi: ardebert did go to your world, it was a plot in several cutscenes
[5:39:00] FluxedOver: hard to say
[5:39:02] joon__joon: dark*
[5:39:02] Darquesoul: no, he would be dead
[5:39:02] Ravoric: you will see as the plot goes on
[5:39:03] Opiekunn: basically in this realm light is bad and darkness is good
[5:39:06] KodyTheTyger: They've been without darkness for like 100 years or something like that. So they pray for a warrior of darkness to come to their aid.
[5:39:10] KaysaDiaz: did you play the earlier expansions?
[5:39:11] Noshpan: Ardbert died in order to come to the Source in the first place
[5:39:13] grayfarron: @filipmundo96  And most of the stuff are old items from events from years past, so if you didnt play the game you can still purchase them. They were once earnable in game.
[5:39:13] Freakzene: Wow had one fairy mog, everything else is free... ff seems to have a lot mogs with price tags
[5:39:15] FluxedOver: yeah in this world, light and darkness are inverted
[5:39:15] Vexxsis: yeah Are would be dead
[5:39:26] FluxedOver: as far as traditional roles
[5:39:46] Vexxsis: What @fluxedover  said
[5:39:47] TheUnknowing: Yeah, but people don't seem to mind, its two different communities @Freakzene
[5:39:51] metavahn231: well he was the WoD when you fought him wasent he
[5:39:57] FluxedOver: yes
[5:39:59] nixxy_7: thats a lto of info on 3 lines stones..
[5:40:03] FluxedOver: well, sort of.
[5:40:07] Freakzene: I do think costumes are prob the best sort of cash shop content
[5:40:12] FluxedOver: Elidibus called them that, but they thought they were the warriors of light
[5:40:25] Vexxsis: sorta, he was just manipulated
[5:40:28] TheUnknowing: Anything cosmetic i feel is best @Freakzene
[5:41:02] grayfarron: @Freakzene  And most of the costumes were once earnable through events, they bring back old stuff for purchase when the event rolls around again, while vets earned it years back for free.

[5:41:05] gHOsTa81: ResidentSleeper
[5:41:15] Alyzzi: I miss when good cosmetics were unlockable with either skill or dedication of time
[5:41:18] FluxedOver: yeah theres tons of glamour that you can only get in mogstation
[5:41:25] Alyzzi: now most games put anything good in a cash shop
[5:41:35] FluxedOver: the raid gear still generally looks better
[5:41:36] 350zee350: LUL How the heck did Towlie end up at FFXIV? lol
[5:41:37] sinlessuk: how did she study that tablet when she cant see
[5:41:46] FluxedOver: and the good looking weapons you can only get from raid
[5:41:47] grayfarron: Youre not buying Ultimate weapons off the mog store dont worry lmao
[5:41:51] Freakzene: I think the only ''scummy'' way to custom clothes is to intentionally make the free options ugly

[5:42:07] grayfarron: @Freakzene  AKA BDO? :P
[5:42:10] Freakzene: Yes
[5:42:17] sinlessuk: ahh thank you
[5:42:24] Freakzene: Well bdo had boring clothes, not quite ugly but boring.
[5:42:27] Vexxsis: Mogstation has a good system
[5:42:51] FluxedOver: theres always some event goin on lol
[5:42:51] Vexxsis: @freakzene  all the badass stuff your farm in game
[5:43:03] ShadoodHD: LA H E E
[5:43:10] Vexxsis: lmao he said la hee
[5:43:11] Lucriseth: Hey everyone :D
[5:43:14] Lucriseth: How are we all?
[5:43:16] grayfarron: Mogtomes allow ya to earn old mounts/cosmetics from older content that may not be getting farmed as often, like rare mount drops from the extreme fights.
[5:43:20] Tetracyclin: SwiftRage LA HEE NotLike This LA HEE rooScream
[5:43:22] RedEyeBuckeye: Is this game worth playing?
[5:43:26] zeychs: @Towelliee You do specific dungeons/alliance raids and get the tomestones to turn in for rare or unonbtainable mounts (its a nightmare unicorn, a ww2 motorcycle plane thing and a magitek preditor from ff6)
[5:43:26] Lucriseth: Man the music in this game is phenomenal
[5:43:28] Alyzzi: its iconic music in this zone.....whether you love it or hate it
[5:43:31] grayfarron: Yes @RedEyeBuckeye
[5:43:39] TweakT: dat musak
[5:43:42] Vexxsis: I still want Advent Children Tifa costume
[5:43:46] Lucriseth: ^
[5:43:57] Kineticbomb: This game is free until level 60. So go and have fun over the weekend.
[5:43:58] grayfarron: @RedEyeBuckeye  Even if its to pick up, play for 2 months and get through all the story, and put down again until the new expac, its extremely worth it
[5:44:09] RedEyeBuckeye: @grayfarron Thanks
[5:44:15] Kineticbomb: And when i say until 60, that's hours ofcontent
[5:44:23] Alyzzi: it is free to play for at least 20 hours of content
[5:44:26] FluxedOver: ARR through the end of heavensward is alot
[5:44:26] Vexxsis: Yeah game is free atm till lvl 60 end of first expansion
[5:44:30] metavahn231: lol whys he called King Towelliee
[5:44:32] FluxedOver: its alot more than 20 hours
[5:44:33] Alyzzi: probably more if you like playing multiple classes
[5:44:38] grayfarron: ^ True. The story grind alone to 60 is about 25+ hours if youre doing JUST that
[5:44:48] KaysaDiaz: first bit of the game is rough, once you get into heavensward content its excellent
[5:44:53] Opiekunn: you can check out trial which got no time limit, you get base game + first expansion for free
[5:44:54] FluxedOver: even if you do the one job, doing the story quests through the end of heavensward and watching cutscenes its long
[5:45:01] FluxedOver: I'm going to say probably like 50-70 hours?
[5:45:09] Vexxsis: @fluxedover  at least
[5:45:22] grayfarron: First bit of the game is a little rough, but if you appreciate it as a humble beginnings story it gets easier to swallow.
[5:45:22] Alyzzi: heavensward was so good, I loved those boss reveals
[5:45:26] zeychs: 1-35=terrible 40-50 ok first part of 50 story grind BLEH second part when dreams of ice starts HOLY SHIT IM HOOKED
[5:45:27] FluxedOver: might be more tbh I havent done that part of the game in so long I forgot how long it was
[5:45:33] Vexxsis: content between ARR and HW is a bit long
[5:45:37] Opiekunn: tho the start of the game is pretty slow but thats true for most RPGs
[5:45:49] Kineticbomb: Slow or not, it's freeeeee
[5:45:50] FluxedOver: the worst part is from ARR end to the introduction of shiva yeah
[5:45:53] Alyzzi: 1-10 was great, its the 10-30 part........please return to the waking sands....
[5:45:57] Kineticbomb: FREEEE
[5:46:05] Kineticbomb: Go get it
[5:46:11] Kineticbomb: stop wasting time
[5:46:13] Vexxsis: I mean it's fucking free , till end of HW
[5:46:18] zeychs: yeah that return to the waking sands for more fetch quests are HORRIBLE
[5:46:18] TheServerMonk: La HEE!
[5:46:26] KaysaDiaz: the end part of story patches right before heavensward is so good. i almost quit right till i got to that
[5:46:27] zeychs: glad they at least give you those tokens now for free instant teleports there
[5:46:52] Vexxsis: Glad they got rid of the two class system to get a job
[5:46:57] Flit1: didnt they improve early levelling last year ?
[5:47:03] meepmeep1212: i just came back to this game like 2-3 weeks ago its soo nice too have lots of content to do XD
[5:47:05] KaysaDiaz: a little
[5:47:09] knight_AU: !webcam
[5:47:12] Kineticbomb: Even if you don't plan on continuein past 60, you still got hours of content you romally pay 60+ whatever currency for.
[5:47:13] Vexxsis: not as much as they wanted
[5:47:14] Alyzzi: we are going la hee crazy
[5:47:17] knight_AU: where is ur webcam towelliee?
[5:47:21] Alyzzi: but I like this music
[5:47:21] Kineticbomb: normally*
[5:47:27] Alyzzi: I just know its very polarizing
[5:47:32] CADZtv: driving me insane tbh this music
[5:47:39] TweakT: 1.24 million gladiator xp points? lol
[5:47:46] FluxedOver: nah i mean i think most ppl think this song is very good
[5:47:51] Vexxsis: Covid pushed back Endwalker so I imagine it pushed back the ARR prune
[5:47:55] zeychs: @Towelliee that even gets you tokens from specific dungeons/alliance raids that can get you shit notably rare or unobtainable mounts (a magitek predator from 6, a ww2 looking air ship, and a nightmare)
[5:48:01] GonoFPS: LUL
[5:48:03] Jeraiya2: LUL
[5:48:04] KaysaDiaz: i just wonder why the lady singing this song is so happy we all have ebola. thats all i hear
[5:48:06] FluxedOver: the ARR reduction happened already
[5:48:13] FluxedOver: its about 1/3 as long as it was
[5:48:14] Broomba: Lol
[5:48:16] Kineticbomb: There is a black fat chocobo version.
[5:48:17] saintsinning: saintsinning subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[5:48:20] grayfarron: Yeah like 100 quests were trimmed lol
[5:48:25] metavahn231: hes so hungry hes runnin for that food
[5:48:33] Tetracyclin: I like it as well, main "issue" of la hee was the lack of transition after calm/sad story cutscenes imo
[5:48:37] Vexxsis: they wanted more of a squish
[5:48:38] Bogzeh: dont forget to grab the stuff for flying in each zone @Towelliee
[5:48:49] acee626: damn a 7.2 earthquake  just hit Japan
[5:49:05] Kineticbomb: again?
[5:49:05] Vexxsis: @acee626 seriously?
[5:49:13] acee626: yes
[5:49:16] Kineticbomb: Japan never get a break from those earthquakes man
[5:49:21] Tetracyclin: at least at waking hours
[5:49:39] Tetracyclin: but that's still way too much for comfort
[5:49:53] acee626: yeah bro right now
[5:50:03] CADZtv: i wish i could turn off ff music on my side KEKW

[5:50:25] TweakT: Kapp
[5:50:29] Vexxsis: Miyagi JP
[5:50:32] Noshpan: Most likely an aftershock of the one that hit Fukashima
[5:50:52] Tetracyclin: their coast, I doubt 7.2 is enough to be noticeable of a tidal wave post pacific
[5:51:06] TweakT: there have been over 50k earthquakes here in Iceland and a volcano erupted last nite
[5:51:07] Vexxsis: Probably Yoshi P being summoned
[5:51:10] Tetracyclin: could come from the same rift
[5:51:32] Freakzene: Spuuders
[5:51:47] CADZtv: dont you have a spider mount in wow lol

[5:54:05] ryderthewriter: so pretty much people are there
[5:54:10] Alyzzi: most people just do fates
[5:54:32] Kineticbomb: Might just be your stats being low from still leveling.
[5:54:36] Vexxsis: no but becomes instant later
[5:54:42] Alyzzi: it still hits hard, your gear is probably just worse due to leveling

[6:13:40] Kineticbomb: There isa recommended tab above your sword. Use that for leveling.
[6:13:43] maccaruso: Blue number, upper right of your character
[6:13:49] nautilus501: I don't know. I've pretty much played every MMO worth playing and, aside from WoW, I think GW2 is just way more fun. IV is just such a chore for so long.
[6:13:57] pepedeeee: hand 2 foot spells
[6:14:01] Kineticbomb: @Towelliee There is a recommended button above your sword. Use that for leveling.
[6:14:13] der_doyle: click the icon abov your sword
[6:14:23] zeychs: I think of ffxiv as an average to ok mmorpg but a freaking phenomenal mmorpg
[6:14:35] Itz_Bildo: @Towellie, not sure if you know this or not, but go above your character and click recommended gear to optimize
[6:14:43] zeychs: jrpg
[6:14:43] WestonTeli: if they had dps pally i'd play

[6:14:45] zeychs: not mmorpg
[6:14:49] zeychs: brain fart there
[6:14:49] Darquesoul: it will update your gear for you
[6:14:58] Kineticbomb: read chat towelliee
[6:14:59] TheItalianStallion321: @Itz_Bildo does the gear have to be in his armoury though for that to work? not in the inventory? i dont remember

[6:15:53] hoyhoy007: you will love eurika towelliee
[6:15:54] Alyzzi: it only checks gear in armory, you may need to clear out some of your amory
[6:15:55] MrStephie: it will check gear ONLY from your armory NOT your inventory
[6:15:56] der_doyle: use it if you gt a new item
[6:16:05] zeychs: @Towelliee yeah its like 30 or 50 of those for the cool mounts
[6:16:12] TheItalianStallion321: @MrStephie right, thats what i thought
[6:16:27] Darquesoul: bozjan is fun
[6:16:29] n0niz: best level music
[6:16:29] ChosenRonin: the only way recommended gear works is if its in your Armory stash
[6:16:37] TheItalianStallion321: you need to put it in the glam closet? i think?
[6:16:39] Darquesoul: if you make a glamour plate for it, it does
[6:16:41] TheItalianStallion321: i havent played this in months
[6:16:47] hoyhoy007: I wish if it had a transmog system like wwo
[6:16:49] hoyhoy007: wow
[6:16:53] Vexxsis: @hoyhoy007 starting Bard eurika next week
[6:17:07] Darquesoul: you have to go to the inn and add them to the chest
[6:17:08] Dontyxiv: theres a thing in the inn that lets you keep transmog
[6:17:09] 4dsnake_: lol
[6:17:16] TheItalianStallion321: thats a HW skip
[6:17:18] metavahn231: story skip LUL
[6:17:24] Vexxsis: HW job skip
[6:17:25] Darquesoul: go to an inn
[6:17:31] zeychs: @Towelliee When you are in an inn you can dump them into a dresser to use to make glamour plates. It takes them out of your inventory but it only has so many spots
[6:17:36] Naschsack: You need to go to an inn and put the things u want to keep for glam in your glamour dresser
[6:17:45] ShadoodHD: oh yeeeea
[6:17:47] Alyzzi: skip ARR, but HW story is so good
[6:17:56] BadXo: good morning @Towelliee - did you see the volcano eruption going on in Iceland ?
[6:18:11] Alyzzi: most of the ARR story is in the raid dungeon anyways
[6:18:15] Vexxsis: bad idea tbh to skip for new ppl
[6:18:19] Alyzzi: which is good, but most people will not see it
[6:18:31] TweakT: ye its far away from my town
[6:18:34] Kineticbomb: @Towelliee You have a inventory for gear that's seperate from normal items. You can put all your transmog stuff in there you wish to keep.
[6:18:34] BadXo: it's away from people, and not huge
[6:18:36] Vexxsis: players will be overwhelmed and lost
[6:18:42] L4dy_Renegade: Having an Omni character means you need to get at least one additional retainer to store your extra gear sets. monkaS
[6:18:43] TweakT: its a smole squirt for now
[6:18:47] grampspeaches: iceland is melting lol

[6:45:52] Oneeye2cu: Oneeye2cu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[6:45:58] hoyhoy007: fate exp is nerfed
[6:45:58] Lelomak: for pure leveling
[6:46:03] Nehcrom: Get the fates with the exp bonus those are neat.
[6:46:06] Kineticbomb: If people see you tanking something, they usually join in.
[6:46:10] Ezekyler: zdps build KEKW

[6:46:39] annnts: 10
[6:47:10] Kineticbomb: almost 300k
[6:47:18] Nicole_GR: I can't wait for loki!

[6:47:28] sam0pen: endgame you need to
[6:47:30] Lemonmunch3r: Anyone else feel like the markers and effects in this game are totally misplaced in context to the world and character artstyles?
[6:47:30] Dontyxiv: fates are alright
[6:47:30] zeychs: @Towelliee they farm specific ones for relic weapons
[6:47:39] DragonofEternity: fates are mostly for relic weapon grinding
[6:47:40] mett7: you cna farm fates for rewatds
[6:47:42] grokshar: you can farm fates to get cool rewards
[6:47:42] sam0pen: if you want relic weapon
[6:47:44] Bogzeh: msq and daily roulettes should be more than enough xp
[6:47:49] Dewulfi: they do grind
[6:47:50] boiimaruku: is it worth to play?
[6:47:55] WaifuHunterPhD: fates are ez materials
[6:47:56] Kineticbomb: Boss fates are still good when you see one going from quest to quest. Extra exp is always nice if youcan kill it fast.
[6:48:03] DragonofEternity: snake... SCREEEEEE
[6:48:16] Sathalan: @boiimaruku well there's a free trial so you can decide for yourself

[6:48:37] boiimaruku: thanks !
[6:48:44] Sathalan: opo opo is a monkey
[6:48:45] L4dy_Renegade: If you think fates are irrelevant just wait to see if the Yo Kai event ever comes back. LUL
[6:48:48] Lemonmunch3r: @boiimaruku It's veeeery grindy and the mandatory story is super long
[6:48:51] Kineticbomb: This game is free until level 60 which is the full base game + 1 expansion.
[6:49:08] Kineticbomb: Dunno if you are allowed to do every single thing with a free trial but still hours of content

[7:03:25] muhbuhtuh: you dont need to use the glam dresser
[7:03:26] Naschsack: yes
[7:03:33] EllytheDruid: Yes you can, but you will use prisms and dye every time, rather than saving it as an outfit
[7:03:33] Bogzeh: u need to register the skin first
[7:03:37] Kineticbomb: But it's way more annoying that way because you will have to do that every time
[7:03:43] xristakios: why dont you just use glamour prism
[7:03:48] saltseal: @Towelliee You use a Glamour prism every time you do that

[7:04:51] EllytheDruid: Think of the glamour dresser as a way to build complete outfits that you can then re-apply at the drop of a hat in a city.
[7:05:00] TheItalianStallion321: you only have 200 slots
[7:05:03] TheItalianStallion321: 400

[7:05:26] Kineticbomb: Make it better and easier
[7:05:33] TheItalianStallion321: then you can take HOURS making glam sets....the REAL end game
[7:05:41] Vexxsis: @towelliee  in the inn your retainer has your Zenith blade if it's not not In your inventory

[7:07:03] Kineticbomb: Well he asked for it. He wanted to glamour himself
[7:07:08] Dontyxiv: is it the one thats only for PLD?
[7:07:09] Kineticbomb: This is how you do it
[7:07:28] saltseal: You can't put Relics inside the Glamour dresser i think
[7:07:37] TheItalianStallion321: you cannot
[7:07:41] mett7: you can put relics
[7:07:47] Sydwase: It’s in the armoire
[7:07:49] Dontyxiv: try to write /isearch "anti" to find where its in your inventory/retainers
[7:07:58] TheItalianStallion321: check your armoire?
[7:08:01] TheItalianStallion321: next to the dresser
[7:08:05] TheItalianStallion321: or your retainers?
[7:08:07] Vexxsis: It's in your Bank/retainer
[7:08:12] Kineticbomb: I know what you mean towelliee but i do not remember the armor. Did you not dye it white?
[7:08:16] Vexxsis: call your retainer out
[7:08:20] mett7: ratainer, or bank, or chocobo saddle?
[7:08:25] xristakios: if you dont find it you can get it back really easy
[7:08:28] WaifuHunterPhD: yeah you can only place relic replicas in dressers
[7:08:30] TheItalianStallion321: then check your retainers @Towelliee

[7:09:32] Vexxsis: Boom
[7:09:36] EllytheDruid: Certain holiday rewards, the base 50 artifact gear, and achivement gear can all go into the amorie rather than the glamour dresser. The two are connected so if something can go into the amoire then you want to put it there first.
[7:09:44] Sandman_88: oops said Valorant. my b
[7:09:45] Dontyxiv: write /isearch gall
[7:09:51] letrickyxd: @Towelliee type /isearch gall

[7:13:11] TheItalianStallion321: this game is definitely a learning curve lol
[7:13:23] muhbuhtuh: hapLUL

[7:15:03] PromithesOG: @Towelliee you have a seperate inventory for equipment
[7:15:11] Lelomak: it just has to be in the glamour chest
[7:15:17] EllytheDruid: That is the warning that it can go into the Armoire and suggesting you put it there instead to save on glamour dresser space. It was the top line that was warning you.
[7:15:20] TheItalianStallion321: we should all tell Towelliee to not level and just craft.....he will go out of his mind
[7:15:25] Reaghol: you need replicas to put in glamour dresser

[7:17:51] EllytheDruid: Do the weapon the regular way one at a time.
[7:17:54] Dontyxiv: you can use glamour prisms for it instead of the dresser
[7:17:55] EllytheDruid: Other way
[7:18:02] TheItalianStallion321: chose your weapon you're equipping
[7:18:03] rasynnas: right click current gear and cast
[7:18:05] EllytheDruid: Cast glamour on your real weapon
[7:18:06] ShadoodHD: glamour... the real endgame
[7:18:06] TheItalianStallion321: yes
[7:18:07] Bogzeh: for relic weapons u need to get a replica first @Towelliee
[7:18:08] saltseal: yes
[7:18:08] TheItalianStallion321: correct
[7:18:15] EllytheDruid: Yeah there you
[7:18:20] Bogzeh: oh nvm
[7:18:20] xristakios: i have never used this for glamours i am only using glamour prisms and keep 1-2 items i like in my inventory
[7:18:21] TheItalianStallion321: you need glamour prisms remember if you run out
[7:18:25] EllytheDruid: Second one in the list
[7:18:26] Lelomak: he just needs a prism as long as the relic is in ur inventory
[7:18:29] billybaroo1: is this on mobile?
[7:18:31] Lelomak: he does not need a replica

[7:19:20] Dontyxiv: can't save relics, need to replicate them
[7:19:22] ShadoodHD: yes you can, along with the weapon
[7:19:22] Sandman_88: just your weapons you cant
[7:19:29] ShadoodHD: minus the relic weapon
[7:19:30] EllytheDruid: Need to buy replicas of your relic to put in the dresser.
[7:19:33] Vexxsis: it's saved just cast glams for the sword/shield normally
[7:19:42] TheItalianStallion321: LOL

[7:19:53] ShadoodHD: Glamour (Savage)
[7:19:53] Vexxsis: you earned a high five
[7:19:55] EllytheDruid: Because the previous relic tends to be used to skip a step in the next one, the actual items won't go in.
[7:19:55] Lelomak: he needs zodiac zeta level to make replicas of arr relics
[7:20:06] Sandman_88: ^
[7:20:08] Darquesoul: looking good is extremely important
