[1:54:29] WagwanBombaClatBomba: this rog could be high exp and sniped him
[1:54:38] imminent999: he randomly changed targets tho while doing a rotation
[1:54:58] OGBeads: subterfuge should not change bars tho
[1:55:35] Stepbrogue: Could be [combat] macro instead? @beadsie
[1:55:45] OGBeads: yeah maybe
[1:55:50] Thmslw: Pika has blades up, maybe it's made to counter blades with disarm insta, idk

[1:58:49] Melvred: Why should pika vanish? The disarm? I had disconnect
[1:58:53] blueberrypieface: LUL
[1:59:02] Stepbrogue: Could just be mashing buttons and accidentally hit focus step+kidney and then tar arena2 macro or something
[1:59:14] ardalolthe: I think it's just someone piloting
[1:59:17] Stepbrogue: Or I Mean, hit focus step+kidney and then accidentally target arena2
[1:59:30] imminent999: so he doesnt get stunned
[1:59:48] Melvred: Thx, understood
[2:00:02] ardalolthe: someone at 1600 there's not way he would be doing this unless someone is piloting the char honestly
[2:00:03] ferahgok: or just cloak disarm(if pvp talent) and stun
[2:00:17] nothingnezzx: LUL
[2:00:19] nothingnezzx: THE FUCK
[2:00:21] Agrero7: for me its not weird
[2:00:24] emergence_fi: this part is not weird
[2:00:24] Thmslw: Only fishy thingy is the disarm, which can be scripted to auto-use on Shadowblades which Pika had pre popped in stealth.
[2:00:25] Monkreqyxt: pika has evasion up of course he's gonna step kidney
[2:00:25] DCBen: its likd a 2k player facing r1
[2:00:28] Agrero7: ofc when the disarms ends you can continue
[2:00:29] DCBen: OMEGALUL
[2:00:30] Galaxxius_Gaming: isnt that completely normal
[2:00:31] grris: thats insane plays for NA
[2:00:33] happykqt: why u watching this second day
[2:00:35] RuckusTVx: It's not wierd at all
[2:00:35] Aypex01: why would he step kidney right there in front of him
[2:00:36] lemarox: cz its a low player
[2:00:39] 로켓경로: its NA
[2:00:40] sneakybilly: because its low rated and hes use to low rated play style
[2:00:41] AkejohnssoN: Idk seems quite normal to me
[2:00:44] RuckusTVx: You step kidney incase he eevasions
[2:00:46] Melvred: Rogues do it all the time. Pika is just making a story. He knows I guess
[2:00:46] diskmachin1: that is exactly it
[2:00:50] sanatalive: whoa they didnt allow a cc gap who coulda thought
[2:00:51] WagwanBombaClatBomba: could be a snipe to
[2:00:56] freshfrifly: step kidney on pika might have been a mistake, maybe he messed up what his focus target is
[2:00:59] Mooreeze: he stands next to him, why shadowstep?
[2:00:59] Raikubest: Its not what is weird, its weird that the rogue is killing him without targeting him
[2:01:01] Lauritsp: because its a step kidney and he is right next to him? am i dumb?
[2:01:02] Sibble7: I mean you are one of the best rogues in the world though whazz lol.  Who is this? kalvish? LOL
[2:01:02] emergence_fi: no its not weird the weird part was the movement and the targeting when he was doing dmg but ye
[2:01:04] dankgamer97: alt account prob
[2:01:09] Ferventiiii: this mindset is the prob : IM THE BEST PLAYER
[2:01:14] Raikubest: yea show
[2:01:14] Lauritsp: why not just stand close to him if u gonna stun
[2:01:16] camgirlxo: akro undercover Kappa
[2:01:16] lemarox: yea could also be a piloted account
[2:01:25] lemarox: its so cringe kinda what pika is saying
[2:01:29] lemarox: honestly
[2:01:29] emergence_fi: he was doing the same movement as the bot shamans too
[2:01:39] Raikubest: nono he does dmg
[2:01:42] Raikubest: he presses abilities
[2:01:44] WagwanBombaClatBomba: step kidney focus macro?
[2:01:47] bobthegoblin_: focus or arena keybind? how is it weird
[2:01:51] Raikubest: i mean he can have focus in all dmg spells
[2:01:51] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:01:51] blackvpnv: he want to put mage back in focus
[2:01:52] WagwanBombaClatBomba: how is it weird
[2:01:56] FlashZappa: lol thats crazy you think thats not a cheater
[2:01:58] eX1stnZ_: @Raikubest maybe it's the disc priest no ? cuz disc pump with the proper spec
[2:01:58] 0xaxzy: there is a script that can attack ANYONE even if youre not targeting them
[2:02:01] cheeppy: Dude they are trolling you.... pika is clean and pro AF
[2:02:10] virth123: Pika always plays vs low players and just stomp them without they doing anything. Now he's found a player with 2iq  and he got stomped and cring
[2:02:13] jonathan0_41: it’s not strange easy to predict if pika always starts with active bugs
[2:02:15] imminent999: he is hitting pika even while targeting mage
[2:02:15] jorg82: This could all be in one macro. SS, Kidney, retarget.
[2:02:17] Sibble7: He dropped 40% while the rogue is targeting the mage
[2:02:19] ferahgok: he did do some damage before the target back to pika
[2:02:21] Raikubest: he pistol shot him atleast
[2:02:21] mysticalmoun: maybe he got same bar for focus
[2:02:23] kondern: if u use enable action targeting it can be like that i belive
[2:02:26] ardalolthe: he is spamming while he is targeting the team mate
[2:02:34] poxpoxxd: its a cheat buff
[2:02:35] lemarox: but pika saying how does he step kidney me is kinda cringe asf
[2:02:35] Agrero7: mouse over pistol shot @Raikubest ?
[2:02:36] 0xaxzy: he is a scripter
[2:02:39] poxpoxxd: u get 100% ambush
[2:02:44] Retzars: maybe mouse over macro
[2:02:52] 0xaxzy: he got banned too or he changed name
[2:02:55] redfernn: mouse over deffo
[2:02:56] redfernn: lol
[2:02:57] eX1stnZ_: mouseover pistol shot ?  Kappa
[2:02:59] poxpoxxd: but if it was really cheat how would that cheat work then
[2:03:01] imminent999: no its fine guys he has arena 1 2 3 pistol shot
[2:03:02] Aypex01: hes a scripter i think. either way , it was definitely a weird encounter

[2:03:06] ardalolthe: @Whaazz what if it's just a pilote player?
[2:03:09] jorg82: pistol shot also can be macroed to nearest enemy
[2:03:10] FlashZappa: the timing of his cloak and step was like 0.1 s
[2:03:15] iceskip_wow: dont know for me the first disarm was sus as fuck
[2:03:18] iliketurkle: whaazz>pikaboo
[2:03:25] Krozzyfix: what are we talking about?
[2:03:26] 0xaxzy: @poxpoxxd a cheat can attack anyone youre not even targeting etc
[2:03:33] Sibble7: The opener is sus as well though
[2:03:48] imminent999: because the guy is playing perfect at 1600 i guess
[2:03:48] Moobot: My first vlog ever! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E690kmX6HJc
[2:03:55] WagwanBombaClatBomba: he got complete 1bee9
[2:03:58] 0xaxzy: the instant disarm is weird
[2:03:58] Ceribi: im lowkey hyped for whaazz boomy tbh
[2:03:58] ferahgok: was that skipping around chalked up to lag?
[2:03:59] jBeastwood: I use @mouseover @target binds for a lot of abilitites on multiple characters

[2:04:16] FlashZappa: lmao
[2:04:18] Aypex01: he ques a billion twos, he probably just thought it felt really weird. and it did seem wierd
[2:04:18] 0xaxzy: the movement is not cheating lmao
[2:04:18] Recklessqt99: tbh, pika isnt even a benchmark for good players.
[2:04:18] Gingtko: Mehhy
[2:04:19] Monkreqyxt: is that mehh
[2:04:20] Mooreeze: would like to see the clip from the other rogue
[2:04:20] Melvred: You can admit it was you on NA smurf
[2:04:20] ferahgok: he was like porting around on the kidney.
[2:04:25] drjebxyz: what was the rogue doing
[2:04:28] scripterxz: didnt mehh quit?
[2:04:31] salk76: actually meh Pog
[2:04:34] palablitz: MEHHX IS THE GOAT
[2:04:34] Lauritsp: why wouldnt he just stand close to him? like why move and step kidney?
[2:04:42] taylors09: mouseover, gtfo :D
[2:04:46] FoxiekittenWoW: @scripterxz he quit from competing, he still plays the game abit
[2:04:47] FlashZappa: so hes laggy unless hes pressing cloak or stepping within 0.1 s of pika pressing a button
[2:04:52] 0xaxzy: @Lauritsp pikaboo had evasion up so he step kidney pikaboo
[2:04:59] johnny_versace: The Rogues stats on 1600 was 19wins 9 loses, so obviously he was just pushing
[2:05:09] EmbreakerXD: that rogue was a fresh account yday and today you already cant find it anywhere on checkpvp etc
[2:05:20] Krozzyfix: idk i take it as a compliment
[2:05:31] Krozzyfix: imagine playing so good people think you break the tos
[2:05:33] Lazeeqt: well its more simple to consider everyone is a cheater
[2:05:40] Lauritsp: @0xaxzy but why step to him? cant he just press kidney?
[2:05:51] 0xaxzy: @Lauritsp pikaboo had evasion up
[2:05:52] Stepbrogue: No he had evasion up @Lauritsp
[2:05:53] silent6821: which character is meh?
[2:06:05] Lazeeqt: evoker healer Sinh
[2:06:07] retard234: show dps skada
