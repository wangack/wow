Well, this is a serious enterprise and a reputable business and you are harming the interests of my company by denying Pyramids™. I’ll have you know that as we speak a full team of highly specialized twitch lawyers is studying this case and will bring justice. Maybe now you will think twice before denying a pyramid.
