[4:34:39] Guffels: https://wago.io/yrG5W6BxK
[4:35:12] Bartel131: I'll give it a shot.
[4:35:23] theBroHam: yeah i don't use elvui and do the same thing
[4:35:28] Guffels: does it also make fyrakk ads huge too?
[4:35:32] rapiwow: Did u time Tott sir ?
[4:35:41] theBroHam: yes it works for Chromie and Fyrakk
[4:35:53] godenstag: in general what do I seek for stats? Like % of haste, vers and crit or mast?

[4:37:24] rapiwow: I have a key for you then 28 Tott after tindral jail if u want KEKW
[4:37:30] jdotb: haste to the 20% dr, vers to the 10% dr, then either crit for more dmg or mast for healing
[4:37:31] Guffels: Haste to 20%dr, vers to 10% dr. fill with crit for dps or mastery for hps
[4:37:44] godenstag: thanks!
[4:39:11] rapiwow: I think i watched that aug/outlaw/dh
[4:39:17] rapiwow: outlaw did pretty low damage
[4:39:47] rapiwow: We can run it sir i'm outlaw and u find people u want ofc
[4:40:27] lazylad02: tindral jail GoldPLZ
[4:40:32] walkinginyourshoes: What do you drop to take the Hotw?
[4:41:24] maenkins: is the loss of haste bad??
[4:41:28] Lara_TV_: Myth track?
[4:41:28] yama_class: trinket
[4:41:36] yama_class: just for the sake of having it
[4:41:53] TSmarine: socket.
[4:42:05] coldmaster333: options options...
[4:43:14] Snizzlenose: I mean looking at the evang windows for fyrakk, the 2 min ramps would say that ashes would actually be better
[4:43:14] abeldank: tindral flops over btw now
[4:43:22] Guffels: Fyrakk probably also good since you have 1 minute SF and 2 min evang
[4:43:24] TSmarine: @abeldank this
[4:43:28] TSmarine: prep for fyrakk
[4:43:41] yama_class: I ThOuGhT ThiS BoSs WaS FreE
[4:43:55] abeldank: we were 440 pulls into tindral progging mid/late p3 and then yesterday we killed before 450 pulls
[4:43:55] Guffels: gotta get that copy pasta ready
[4:44:07] Lara_TV_: I mean seeds are a joke now, so you should at least consistently get to p3
[4:44:08] maenkins: YEP

[4:44:17] TSmarine: Fyrakk imo harder then tindral by far
[4:44:19] yama_class: we're on the second seeds
[4:44:21] Lara_TV_: fake news
[4:44:46] abeldank: you lose a shitton of the dumb p1 deaths and reduce like 90% of the p2 seed wipes if you've already progged through them
[4:44:57] skelthu: @jdotb disci priest on tindral needs the trinket from wm or the ashes is better?
[4:45:16] abeldank: ashes is prbly better, branch buff drops so quickly it's very sad
[4:45:19] dilweed88: dilweed88 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! LOOK AT ME GO
[4:46:08] abeldank: i think the tindral nerfs made it way less of a headache boss for healers with the reduced seed dot dmg
[4:46:39] dilweed88: @abeldank tell that to jb
[4:47:09] Taaz: idk if i did something to my headset but every now and again JB is in both my ears like 1 second off of eachother
[4:47:47] abeldank: my ramp timing on that platform was starting right as flyers broke us for those seeds
[4:47:47] Snizzlenose: our tindral kill I did just that, it felt scuffed but it worked
[4:47:56] dilweed88: throwing in flash heals mid-ramp is the absolute worst feeling lol
[4:48:44] abeldank: my rapture timing to start my ramp, not evang itself. evang was right after i dispelled myself
[4:48:47] abeldank: i had spatial though
[4:50:31] abeldank: the real buff though was the (i think bug) change where you can whirling surge and get that vigor returned for whatever reason. you arrive at the platform like 5 seconds sooner so the boss gets deleted with the dmg buff before his shield goes up

[5:01:38] Guffels: @Bronloch 417
[5:01:41] abeldank: i would think socket tbh, i think ashes is prbly only played on tindral?
[5:01:51] Sokchoy: ur gonna take socket bud
[5:01:52] JukeboxHey: 488 :O
[5:01:57] JukeboxHey: Damn dude
[5:01:59] abeldank: i think the real benefit of ashes is that the dmg instances on tindral cause you to lose branch stacks so fast
