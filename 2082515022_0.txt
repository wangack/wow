[0:59:54] Robohobbo: what
[0:59:57] llseattlell: your on frost foxyllama is in a SS and an arcane mage is farming ppl in his que

[1:03:29] Wrathbb1: so they are 100% in line for buffs
[1:03:56] CabinetMistake: Pog Clap sunday for me i'm stoked

[1:04:35] hamsti: Clap
[1:04:58] five_moke: I’d say it’s like 90% on par with the book
[1:05:23] hamsti: Its impossible for a movie to be 100% on par with book. Unrealistic IMO but its super good for a movie adaption
[1:06:35] five_moke: I mean like they didn’t make huge changes or leave out key parts. to bad the director already closed down conversations about putting out and extended version like LOTR
[1:07:31] Robohobbo: JESUS
[1:07:32] Applezbtw: LUL

[1:14:16] willcabs: I’ve said this since day one . what’s your opinion on solo shuffle 2s dps only
[1:14:34] arcane_p: that wouldn't fix that they have the most cc still
[1:14:42] arcane_p: and in double dips that's all that matters
[1:14:59] koonakeenay: @willcabs would prolly feel a lot like skirms lol

[1:43:51] SpeedyMcD: i like how DH
[1:43:55] BrewCral: 140k dps single target KEKW
[1:43:56] SpeedyMcD: can fly across the map in 2 seconds
[1:43:57] Pidly: Your getting Demonhuntered
[1:44:30] AlleviateWoW: dh needs more mobility and damage
[1:44:56] AlleviateWoW: not smorc enough
[1:45:06] Humorism: If beastcleave was a spec it'd be havoc
[1:45:19] BrewCral: and still no changes like what the fuck is this game lmao
[1:45:25] BrewCral: how do they think this shit is ok
[1:45:37] SpeedyMcD: theyre not going to balance classes because MDI is still going on. it is what it is
[1:45:42] xabstracct: go figure an add break 1-8
[1:45:44] Wrathbb1: pvp would be super balanced if they just banned any  class but DH from queuing
[1:45:47] dismantlle: its funny that I quit in s1 and everyone was complaining that dh was too good and now I come back and its still happening KEKL
[1:46:17] dismantlle: only thing thats changed is shaman is now good
[1:46:17] williwhite94: tbh i hated DH then i started playing one and i get it its fun af lol

[1:46:59] Applezbtw: does having only one school make it tough to play in your opinon?
[1:47:10] wackpoetic: DH is enjoyable because you can use their talent tree like an etch-a-sketch and still outdamage any other class
[1:47:12] buffnac: dh is fun even when it sucks just cuz it’s so chill to play lol
[1:47:20] hamsti: Give back the fire spell thing for affliction as a filler spell if ur locked on shadow
[1:47:23] novokaine47: What class do ytou think has the most finess type of feeling?

[1:58:19] leeka: and 3s and shuffle
[1:58:20] themilllion: atleast hes bored playing it
[1:58:31] jporter_: i fought dh rdruid after dh sham after dh rdruid all night in 2s
[1:59:05] koonakeenay: you can tell its a demonhunter by the way that he is
[1:59:41] koonakeenay: well thertes a lot of noob demon hunters especially in terms of them being defensive
[1:59:41] Magottx: I’m so tilted. All my money is on my Apple Pay so I went to get a 20$ blizzard card so I can add game time. And you can’t resub with blizzard balance but you CAN buy a 30$ 2 MONTH game time and that’s it. ALSO can’t use the AH for a token on trial account.
[1:59:49] koonakeenay: so its still barely maneageable but yeah its a problewm
[1:59:51] Magottx: Why do they gotta be so fkn scummy about money man
[1:59:55] nikthevoker: my last lobby was 3 DH rdryud.fw im scarred foir life LUL
[2:00:06] nightmoonx11: If Faker played WoW how long u think he would need to get R1
[2:00:23] Magottx: Sorry I’m done. Rage rant done
[2:00:30] koonakeenay: you can buy a wow token with blziz balance i think
[2:01:01] Magottx: So I went all the way to store with intention ti get a card for the 15$ month sub
[2:01:23] Pidly: The token on trial account is probably to combat gold sellers and botters
[2:01:39] Magottx: I just don’t get why they gotta try scraping everyone for everything
[2:02:00] Magottx: You used to be able to buy just one month now you can’t
[2:02:15] koonakeenay: cant you get a debit card for apple pay or naw
[2:02:41] Magottx: You can yea but I don’t. I start my new job in a 2 weeks so my real card will be loaded
[2:02:56] Magottx: But rn I’m training on the side for cash
[2:04:45] Magottx: Did you hoist heavy objects today sir

[2:05:03] zen_oni_shinobi: @williwhite94 I second that.
[2:06:16] Magottx: Afflic in 2s is miserable I always hate it.
[2:08:12] McLarge: Hello Ven. How are you doing today? Did you see that Rudar made an addon that shows you at what point in your cast your opponents are pressing their interrupts? He has a short 20s video on his YT channel demonstrating how it works
[2:08:45] zen_oni_shinobi: oh.  hope everythings alright
[2:08:53] famous1939: what a jinx by that guy
[2:08:56] TactiTortoise: All good dude. Hope its all ok :)
[2:09:15] zen_oni_shinobi: @venruki hey, any thoughts on the potential cooking stream?
[2:09:22] leeka: I miss all my kicks so the addon wont work vs me
[2:09:27] Magottx: Cya friend hope everything’s good
[2:09:38] McLarge: I think it'll be very impactful for ladder, but for AWC/Tourney play probably a bit less useful
[2:09:52] leeka: I want to pvp so bad, but blizzard doesnt want me to play
