[0:19:29] Gizimoo86: 12 month Classic cycle with changes, harder raid bosses and faster leveling etc.
[0:19:43] tiranz__: - World buffs (like Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer and others) disabled in Raid instances - Restoring mechanics that were removed early on to some Raid bosses - No boss debuff limit (up from 16 debuffs in WoW Classic) - Increased health on bosses, to offset player buffs and the removed debuff limit -We‚Äôre planning on increasing experience gains from what they were in the first iteration of WoW Classic. Our current plan is to set them close to what the 1-60 XP rates are in Burning Crusade Class
[0:19:53] Ludjack: Its fresh classic, no botting, no wowtoken, and brand new mode for ironman challenge

[0:21:49] sckful: are you sad that Thanos snapped over half wow players? @Swifty
[0:22:09] Maria_Neefay: Also "a regular and repeated pattern of activity", so the term has a more abstract and broad implementation than just musical rhythm
[0:22:27] The_Mpower: i think there's still millions of players in wow
[0:22:27] Gymisemptyy: can you explain or where can i read these freah servers, any new on them compared to old ?

[2:33:15] solo19op: you can reserve it now
[2:33:30] solo19op: I think that was a feature
[2:33:48] tolginyoo: new world should die, it's the worst mmorpg i've ever played
[2:33:50] DomnuDone: Swifty, what a legend!
[2:33:52] EddyyBear: New World is dying (* according to Google Trends)
[2:33:55] Skycoh: go right
[2:34:18] solsaver12: New World is good game
[2:34:32] tolginyoo: i play solely pvp in wow but i didn't get to play pvp in new world because level 60 takes like 250 hours
[2:34:38] Teddmelk: people are mad over all the bugs in New World, that's all people think about..
[2:34:49] grizzleyconversationalist: new world has to many bugs and lazy devs
[2:34:51] dogshltgamer: No sleepy guys in cave.
[2:34:52] johngalang6: Don't trust google trends. It's trying to influence your opinion
[2:34:57] Hyelander_: @tolginyoo So a game others enjoy must die, just because you dont like it?
[2:35:00] ivomagnum: meh, NW seems super booring to me, but it's great that people are enjoying it

[2:36:11] grosserDaumen: i hope wow 10.0 will be something special
[2:36:15] copperhead493: @Swifty what is your plan for SoM?

[2:37:09] DonShadow: yes wow bad alot of bugs and glitches in vanilla also
[2:37:14] DonShadow: had*
[2:37:21] Vexiusx: They even had a 2day gold dupe exploit going on in new world ruined the game for me.
[2:37:25] Cybernytez: swifty i know you like realisti c graphics like in NW but there are a LOT of people that like cartoony graphics like in Wow
[2:37:50] smackrtv: go around
[2:37:51] zezimahunt: get to the zeepla
[2:38:05] grizzleyconversationalist: @Vexiusx  Can still dupe still
[2:38:08] solo19op: yes @swifty just checked you can reserve only one name on the 11th to prevent people from stealing streamer's names and trolling
[2:38:10] Hyelander_: incredible ORC newb zone tricks
[2:38:23] tolginyoo: gameplay >>>> graphics for me

[2:38:44] solo19op: that's TBC
[2:38:47] tolginyoo: it was me :)

[2:39:27] 11keithi: u will always be swifty, no matter what
[2:39:38] grizzleyconversationalist: @Vexiusx  Exploits arent bannable according to devs so no
[2:39:45] Moobu: I've been watching Swifty's content since the good old youtube days. The first video I ever watched was your tutorial on how to use scrolls to add cool glow effects to hands.
[2:39:47] saizo: how about we steel it for u ?
[2:39:50] Gizimoo86: Just one Bitcoin for name Kappa
[2:40:15] Vexiusx: @grizzleyconversationalist Read the new dev notes on the forums. Everyone is gonna get banned apperently that ever did it
[2:40:15] solo19op: @swifty just mark the 11th you'll see it's on the patch notes

[2:40:35] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[2:40:57] Gizimoo86: They just lazy
[2:41:10] tolginyoo: maybe the guy who took your name is a really swift guy and he earned and deserved it Kappa
[2:41:11] saizo: followers should help u to take the name
[2:41:12] solo19op: asmongold xD
[2:41:15] zezimahunt: can certainly make it happen if blizzard wants
[2:41:17] Tehbeve: why let them get their names, you think streamers are better than us peons?
[2:41:18] grizzleyconversationalist: @Vexiusx  They arent responding to Exploits and only wiped the "Main" peoples gold. they are too incompetent to ban anyone
[2:41:19] Gizimoo86: You could easily setup webpage with Twich login to collect the names
[2:41:20] sifer007: assfand
[2:41:21] kushups9393: rip asmongold
[2:41:25] Valyou3: They should let streamers get their names because its their Brand, I dont get why people steal them
[2:41:29] fapkinz: Bajheera
[2:41:32] Hyelander_: Asmonbold
[2:41:33] PaEu: are u rolling horde?
[2:41:34] zezimahunt: asmonbald is gonna be taken ha
[2:41:38] Tehbeve: that train of thought is exactly why people are taking your names, to show you ain't better than the average person
[2:41:40] Moobu: poor asmond. what a crappy situation
[2:41:41] boogymanttv: did everyone see the post from asmongold?
[2:41:43] litokranius3: your a top guy , I have followed you for years.. what is happening with wow?

[2:41:51] tolginyoo: dekelHORDELUL dekelHORDELUL
[2:42:08] zezimahunt: people just like to grief
[2:42:15] PermaGrinnn: cause only one person in the wolrd can have a name?
[2:42:16] PaEu: Swifty i was watching a few of your old cata/wrath videos yesterday. Best memories of my time in WoW, love u dude <3
[2:42:27] smackrtv: Its like when path of exile gave streamers que priority and everyone had a meltdown
[2:42:28] KingAdrock: Is this beta?
[2:42:29] harnns: yea
[2:42:32] cyrofel: why do they need a beta for fresh ü§®?
[2:42:40] johngalang6: I knew a guy named Bruce Lee in high school and he kept getting beat up and bullied for having that name :(
[2:42:40] Myrzell: why should they?
[2:42:44] zezimahunt: swifterton
[2:42:52] wagasez: I mean, this is a good problem though right? It means people care enough LUL
[2:43:03] zezimahunt: to test exp rates and what people think

[2:43:28] thinkbigger: no
[2:43:29] tolginyoo: 5 levels in 40 minutes Pog
[2:43:30] Moobu: @Tehbeve that's an awful take on it. People spend tons of hours building a brand and establishing content to that brand. People aren't taking names to "knock them down a peg" They're taking the names to leverage things or to gain the notoriety.
[2:43:40] Hyelander_: doesnt feel any different than the classic
[2:43:41] xzoeeeeee: do you like leveling swifty
[2:43:50] zezimahunt: once you get a phat 2h you'll be slayin
[2:43:59] cyrofel: is that all üò∂? nothing big or major ?
[2:44:04] EddyyBear: @cyrofel It's different code. You certainly want to test that, no? The hardcore buff? Would be great to have that tested. No debuff limit? Also nice to test that. And so on.

[2:46:19] xzoeeeeee: i knew billy before he was famous

[2:49:06] Moobu: pretty casual approach to it too. lots of chatting and fun
[2:49:20] knivencs: just use like restedxp? or does it destroy your experience
[2:49:27] awww_peaches: Buy your skills
[2:49:36] Hyelander_: Ive done Orc starting zone on classic and vanilla so many times. It usually took me 50-60 min
[2:49:43] Moobu: impossible
[2:49:47] SenseiTaz: nothing chillin
[2:49:51] Moobu: you'll be farming apples for 45 minutes alone

[2:50:33] resnatt: @Moobu thanks :)
[2:50:33] zezimahunt: you could be a videogame voice actor

[2:51:47] Ava52: i cannot belive it either. now you need to get a horde tattoo
[2:52:08] Gizimoo86: people have tested it for sure, many people leveled to 50 +
[2:52:23] Moobu: Love to see it. Although I gave up ripping on alliance a LONG time ago after their population fell through the floor. Alliance need all the love they can get these days.
[2:52:47] Moobu: I haven't looked in a while but the global population ratios were something like 3 alliance to 7 horde
[2:53:21] zezimahunt: dammmn
[2:53:22] UsmcTanker: Server i am on is 95% horde 5 % Alliance

[4:30:23] rbubbaray: but they may do it here
[4:30:23] gram1312: Hi swifty, is it also your perception that Athene changed? With his house in Germany and the religion thing?
[4:30:26] highroller31: so the smaller faction will have good queue times
[4:30:28] CholThemAll: alliance might be superior this time in PVE due to the raids being harder and all. Longer fights too.

[5:06:02] omnismash81: they are making the grind easier i heard. more research faster
[5:06:23] Sofur1: You only want the Death Advance rep to get all sockets in 9.1.5
[5:06:39] Sofur1: By soul cinders
[5:06:42] Baconloord: are you on eu or na atm?
[5:06:51] tolginyoo: we had the solo queue dream
[5:07:06] whitelight90: how many players are online lately?

[5:07:24] RayWoz: you watch new wow video?
[5:07:27] Sofur1: Exalted
[5:07:32] Imba2424: Skateboarding adds LUL
[5:07:37] Akimbo_UK: So if i have it exalted on my priest then i can socket gear on all chars across diff servers?
[5:07:38] Sofur1: Dailies in Korthia

[5:07:42] Sofur1: Ye
[5:07:52] Dimitrios90: ex-salted LUL
[5:08:03] GiantRatGuy: @Cybernytez im not sure XD but it does give 1 2 %
[5:08:15] Akimbo_UK: I got exalted on my priest and im only tier 4 codex
[5:08:15] tolginyoo: i'm still on the start of tier 4, it's so boring to grind

[5:08:22] Chub4ka: still play classic?

[5:08:24] Akimbo_UK: but that was months ago
[5:08:53] kinkyspatula: jumping back into wow with an alt is hilarious now, in legion the templates made it much easier but i understand they were far from perfect.
[5:08:57] GiantRatGuy: nah
[5:09:01] GiantRatGuy: the research takes longer
[5:09:04] GiantRatGuy: but the rep is fast
[5:09:21] Cybernytez: @GiantRatGuy yeah you dont gain much its not worth in my opinion and idk if u know cdew he said the same
[5:09:21] GiantRatGuy: relic research*
[5:09:26] Baconloord: the long part of the deaths advance socket is the soul embers but even then you can get 1000 in maybe 2/3 weeks

[6:17:27] GiantRatGuy: why do people feel obligated to cheat?
[6:17:33] BeansAnToast: no one uuses hatchet main lol
[6:17:37] Meatbag101: the hatchet is questionable if it should be bannable as you dont active go in for doing it, like the life staff thing
[6:17:55] cameroncarter211: hows your server?

[6:18:36] CreepyMagician: im Using Bow and Hatchet
[6:18:54] GiantRatGuy: @Enmael00 they were evicted? :O
[6:19:19] Bruegs: @GiantRatGuy certain kinds of competitive people will do what ever it takes to get the rush they get when they win. Even if winning gets them no physical reward. The reward they get is the feeling of winning. Some people will do anything to get that feeling.   It is a drug to them
[6:19:48] Gizimoo86: kited
[6:19:54] Resmundo: game play looks so clunky
[6:19:54] Bruegs: I use to play football in college with a guy that use to say all the time. If you are not cheating you are not trying, if you are not trying you are not winning.
[6:19:54] Geeigoe: fix the game and don't ban your players for playing it
[6:20:02] tuco6464: Not bersker ibuff is buged

[6:26:29] Meatbag101: @Gizimoo86 looks like medium
[6:26:30] Giannisxxxx: cause he rolls
[6:26:32] Bruegs: i think everyone runs medium armor in this game. Heavy/light both suck.
[6:26:45] tuco6464: @GiantRatGuy  but work fine whith first pvpv set
[6:26:56] Meatbag101: @Gizimoo86 Actually he just rolled, so light
[6:27:02] Giannisxxxx: @tuco6464 i was lucky enough to be the servers first 200 armorer so i made afk money
[6:27:19] Bruegs: yup he did just roll
[6:27:26] Gizimoo86: @Meatbag101 wow they should lower light armor even more so melee does more dmg
[6:27:38] Bruegs: but see even with a 20% damage increase he is no where close to killing swifty
[6:27:44] tuco6464: let's go swifty :)
[6:28:07] Cooboomy: this looks so painful. Never ending duel

[6:28:47] Meatbag101: @Gizimoo86 well theres that resilience bug which apparently is a flat out dmg reduction and not a crit reduction
[6:28:48] Baddour: @Swifty why not reaper instead of exe
[6:28:52] SonicAtomic: 3min Capture of a 10m fight lol
[6:28:55] funkmeistter: it would be fixed by adding cooldowns to consumables
[6:28:58] Servletz: worst pvp ever

[6:32:53] solsaver12: lol
[6:32:56] Bruegs: there has been a lot of dup'ing in this game. I bought a bag on the AH. When I equipped the bag, it created a second bag of the same kind in my inventory.
[6:32:58] dAniduKe1337: resilence stacking onyx gem  armor stacking
[6:32:58] narshattack: there was some bug and you could post items for trade and keep another copy, effectively duping items apparently

[6:38:17] Eminim97: execute is great damage but sucks for hitting people
[6:38:23] tuco6464: he dont use food and pots if he use yo uneed 6 more players lol
[6:38:25] Sakrasta: This game needs mortal strike in PvP.
