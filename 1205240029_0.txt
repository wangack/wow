[0:20:09] TheKnightsRest: season of mastery
[0:20:23] fearxj: thanks
[0:20:40] snake_like: monkaS
[0:21:18] CardinalTX: havrnt paid attention lately. What exactly is Season of Mastery?
[0:22:25] snake_like: it's classic new game + basically. altered vanilla
[0:28:31] mellowthorn1: pokiAww
[0:28:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Season of Mastery is a WoW Classic season they are starting with the endgame stuff tuned tougher
[0:29:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are making quest exp 40% better and reducing the costs of mounts and riding, but much of it is still Classic
[0:30:24] LemonDrizzleCakes: What's this?
[0:30:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think basically it's for the raiders who thought Classic stuff was too easy, but it helps out casuals, too
[0:30:26] Electafuzz: they're buffing quest xp? didn't know that
[0:31:05] ilikegold123: where  can you play som? just on the classic launcher on tuesday?
[0:31:18] LemonDrizzleCakes: What's SoM?
[0:31:22] zulufucxz: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis not WOW
[0:31:33] Highparkk_: @LemonDrizzleCakes season of mastery, wow classic
[0:31:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it will be in the Classic launcher with realms, there is a season tab at the bottom
[0:32:02] LemonDrizzleCakes: So Classic will have a seasonal option to reset everyone? with seasonal theme?
[0:32:02] snake_like: MC made normal guilds struggle a tiny bit. I'm ready to see how the hardcore SOM characters get through it.
[0:32:14] SLOPEiZ: i thought there was about to be a "som o this dick in yo mouth" joke LUL
[0:32:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Apparently this one is going to last a year and people get a free transfer for their characters to a regular Classic realm at the end
[0:32:38] LemonDrizzleCakes: So Classic will have a seasonal option to reset everyone? with seasonal theme?

[0:33:00] Highparkk_: It'll be wow classic broken into 4 phases....harder bosses, faster leveling stuff like that
[0:33:03] Highparkk_: No world buffs
[0:33:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: The hardcore mode is another feature, people can prove how good they are if they can do everything without dying
[0:33:17] CardinalTX: They are taking WoW the way of Everquest. Re-release the vanilla game with updated rule sets
[0:33:33] Highparkk_: Check dms @LemonDrizzleCakes
[0:35:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still want to see more changes for a kind of Classic+, but I think this is something cool
[0:36:26] casmet1994: So happy to see Towelliee play again wow <3
[0:36:35] Odinslayer: damn this playlist, makes me want to cry brings out crazy memories of the game
[0:36:39] Odinslayer: and morning peeps ! <3
[0:37:39] CardinalTX: WoW is like the mafia. "Just when I thought I was out. They pulled me back in"
[0:37:47] snake_like: god I can't wait to be out of the shadowlands. I know I can go to stormwind whenever, but my mind feeels trapped in the shadowlands ya know
[0:38:19] Odinslayer: @SixFourBoom yea tell me about it, been off the game for about 6 months now and i miss it everyday lol
[0:38:27] Brelshar: @SixFourBoom blame that on the lack of competition, new world is already dead for example.
[0:39:13] Odinslayer: NW is dead cause of amazon, they made  a shitty buggy game lol
[0:39:31] Brelshar: ff14 had its five minutes of twitch fame, and ashes will be as bad as new world :D

[0:39:56] Vowels_tv: @Odinslayer true that -- i mean elyon is a ton of fun too but also dead bc ppl just plain old want to play WoW imo
[0:40:03] Odinslayer: FF14 will get hyped again when endwalker releases but it will tune down after
[0:40:05] Yokingdom: Yokingdom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months, currently on a 63 month streak! 
[0:40:08] CardinalTX: New World was like that date you went on and the person had beautiful eyes. Then they pulled their mask down.    Yikes!
[0:41:03] ZakuzaGB: hey guys, whats tow been up to just getting max renown?
[0:41:16] Odinslayer: @Odinslayer i played elyon to lvl 45 and i quit cause of the stupid grind they put you after 42, the combat in that game is great but everything else is just bad
[0:41:16] CardinalTX: I think so
[0:41:16] Brelshar: @SixFourBoom ive experienced that a couple of mornings after LUL
[0:42:51] Odinslayer: i cant wait for lost ark though, i played the beta and it was amazing

[0:43:18] CardinalTX: Friend of my got me playing Everquest again on a progression server. Been having a blast and the game is 22 years old!
[0:43:26] Odinslayer: @Towelliee rip
[0:43:34] Beatchimp: Ohh sounds painful
[0:44:05] Brelshar: See Asmons review of NW? That was a hell of a Copium hit.
[0:44:22] Odinslayer: yea and he has a big ass point on it
[0:45:39] ZakuzaGB: sounds rough man gotta get them stretches in haha
[0:46:53] ZakuzaGB: i couldnt push through the leveling of new world
[0:47:02] ZakuzaGB: got bored after about 15 hours or so
[0:47:07] ZakuzaGB: its got some good stuff though
[0:49:54] Brelshar: It's just a gathering sim :/

[0:51:31] ZakuzaGB: i mean if they make changes ill check them out and try it again but i think for me its more about the base game maybe its just not for me although i did play runescape for like 10 years haha
[0:54:30] snake_like: new world could have kept me playing if not for it being compromised by economy breaking stuff and blatant pvp exploits not getting fixed
[0:55:08] Highparkk_: I feel like new world has lost a lot of players already, could be wrong though
[0:55:52] yunitoYuniro: How much longer till stream start?
[0:56:11] ZakuzaGB: i saw something about them losing 100k players per week based off of steam stats but idk how accurate that is
[0:56:27] ZakuzaGB: so it went from 900k now its about 300k or less
[0:56:28] kalrick1: i think hence the fact that there was no monthly charge on new world and just paying for the game initially that Amazon wanted to just put a product out there and hit a target market, rack up money and call it. @snake_like
[0:56:52] largefromage: FailFish
[0:56:56] jasonbriggs: new world really has no end game content
[0:57:00] Prymordias: I have put a lot of time and dedication to New World and sadly just falls short for me. I have maxed all skills even yes furnishing and there is nothing left to do but outpost and and box checking and for me I'm already max gs on everything except the spear.
[0:57:02] Sceimoz: !soon

[0:58:27] black3n: what ever happened to sub sunday?
[0:58:32] snake_like: I got my money's worth out of new world. I'll give it that. Kind of wish they could remake it from the ground up, this time without chaning directions every year of development.
[0:58:53] ZakuzaGB: @black3n new games came out and he wants to play them i guess haha
[0:59:06] Abdielo: I though Towelliee was done for a long time with WoW, seems like he is back for good, or this is a relapse.

[1:12:16] gidgeet: Been wanting to go back to wow miss the game
[1:12:18] bearbaboon: since you level so fast with the other things like 10 min /level its too slow
[1:12:19] xReasonZ: The daily is okay
[1:12:20] KaisenSiru: The one time quest per week is decent though I believe
[1:12:25] masterlee05: @Gingerprimer yeah same here... after 10 years of non stop playing i guess is time to find other mmo.. at least for now.... still waiting for Lost Ark

[1:20:42] largefromage: FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:21:00] Skylin3r: eh, crafting is easy mode now
[1:21:32] MOLAR305: well nice to see the double leggo is finally coming in
[1:21:51] Xsilentghost: Do you think they will release the new 9.2 systems on PTR early for testing so they can get feedback quicker and have more time to make changes based off of the early feedback?
[1:21:52] NuAera: meant to be
[1:22:10] nezz231: the ones with a golden ring around them are enhanced
[1:22:12] infinityarty: i made a wa for the tea :D
[1:22:30] healikulus: After a year from breaking up with wow (giving my account to someone) I am thinking of coming back and doing everything from scratch. Do yall think the next exp will be worth it or blizzard is nothing but a memory after their law suits?
[1:23:32] PToastman: just watch us Kappa
[1:23:46] SamAddams: You can drip feed content well like Wrath
[1:24:05] holymonke: blizz almost nerfed vashj and kael in tbc this week. i think that means t6 is soon-ish. hope they don't release in december again like they did with naxx
[1:24:06] FerociouzMonk: @starhinraex stay away if you can
[1:24:11] Funderik: what do you mean tho, it's a narrative unlock not a end game play system
[1:24:40] PToastman: lawsuits arnt not going to kill blizzard, lets not be silly
[1:24:58] Gotxiko: like research in korthia yeah
[1:25:08] healikulus: @starhinraex why so?
[1:25:18] MatheiusS: The stupid state the game is in right now is going to kill Blizzard
[1:25:20] Broomba: !uptime
[1:25:21] Moobot: @Broomba Towelliee has been live for 1h 25m
[1:25:21] Funderik: nahh you got it mixed up, there's a rep system that unlock a tree system, to replace renown, the cypher is just narrative
[1:25:43] RealTalkRenfrow: HOWVE YOU BEEN TOWELLIEE ?!?!?!?!
[1:25:58] zantetsuken990: i miss wow so much. i wish its worth to resub :(
[1:26:02] MOLAR305: the world will not take a stance bc people still think epstien killed himself lol
[1:26:10] MVRD: @zantetsuken990 same dude..
[1:26:32] Broomba: You will get all your characters to renown 80 @towelliee
[1:26:58] PvtHudson093: no
[1:26:58] gold9871: 226
[1:27:01] Mose__: it will upgrade the lowest to next rank
[1:27:07] Mose__: in the spec you are in
[1:27:10] Zerohz1: its starts at lowest rank and undiscoverd
[1:27:11] Pharaoh_326: what Mose said
[1:27:30] PToastman: there is caring and then there is "caring"
[1:27:44] MickyFresc: society itswillJokester
[1:27:45] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee If you feel upto you can Rift key grind to get 252 conduits and gem sockets
[1:27:46] infinityarty: its the reason why we game to forget the shit of the rest of the day :D
[1:28:05] Dark_Kornax: Might as well boycott every company ever then... because they have all had harrassment in one form or another.
[1:28:14] Funderik: that's how i feel to a point, i play a game to escape daily shit irl
[1:28:16] kochiee: will you be coming back to raiding? @Towelliee
[1:28:19] Frostfury: Have you seen Rextroy clip on rift grind in Korthia?
[1:28:23] PToastman: by all means clean out the shitheads
[1:29:02] MOLAR305: your proximity to the issues made it easier to make thr stand
[1:29:06] lithium364: classic blizz andys
[1:29:11] infinityarty: im looking forward to the riot mmo tho
[1:29:13] ElPolloBatman: i'm curious about the blizzard lawsuit involving dreamhaven employees as well
[1:29:33] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee https://www.wowhead.com/news/rextroy-insane-farm-archivists-codex-reputation-10k-per-hour-324793
[1:29:41] lithium364: @Towelliee  you think they would ever shuffle away the holy trinity with 10.0?
[1:29:41] undisputedmoe: !Plater ui
[1:29:51] Funderik: that made me laugh tbh, when people talk about metzens and morhaime companies like they going to be the old blizzard.
[1:30:04] PToastman: get rid of trinity? never
[1:30:17] Specsifier: I'm real happy with the Torghast changes. I can run as many 8s as I want to make my leggos. 12s are just too hard and for the content I do I don't need Adamant Vaults
[1:30:24] 91Niki: Sup Towelliee and chat HeyGuys
[1:30:34] Topazthunder: even if they clean house, wow will continue with these copy/paste content
[1:30:49] MickyFresc: cries in OSRS PepeHands
[1:31:11] Funderik: that's an arpg style system not mmorpg
[1:31:14] PToastman: I dont think people hate copy/paste content as much as they think. They want good content not necessarily original content
[1:31:14] MOLAR305: for regular Johnny q. sub, there was rarely any impact to any of their personal relationships. so they won't stop playing. Because streamers have those ties, it's harder to not feel some impact of what was going on
[1:31:26] 91Niki: Can’t use my twitch prime on mobile REEEEE
[1:31:29] Aquadriel: trinity roles give you a sense of responsibility, and people kidn of like that.
[1:31:29] MrbatataTV: Black Desert
[1:31:29] e__115: hello my friend
[1:31:36] datboi2o25: What happened to new world will u still play that?
[1:31:36] ElPolloBatman: the issue with gw is that at some point you have to tank in a dungeon due to drawing aggro, and you're fucked by a glass cannon build
[1:31:39] FerociouzMonk: it's more of a diablo style game
[1:31:45] Mitchendo64: it's an mmoargp
[1:31:48] kharditv: towStop towIt
[1:31:52] Beatchimp: Any idea when 9.2 ptr might be out !!?
[1:31:55] oreo_mintx: Does lost ark still have some hype ? like they just finished the beta testing but it didnt really take off ?
[1:31:59] largefromage: fishHuh
[1:32:04] speederinho: na its graphic are like diablo, but the gameplay is an mmorpg
[1:32:21] Mitchendo64: I think everyone in the west is waiting for Lost Ark
[1:32:21] Cabone1: I remember the old BRF viewer runs, good old days :D
[1:32:25] Press_Escape: towCringe
[1:32:29] e__115: how are you today
[1:32:31] PToastman: baldurs gate clone
[1:32:34] datboi2o25: Damn new world just forgotten lmfso
[1:32:38] Funderik: @Volly no because limited party size and you don't see people randomly around the world, it's either solo or 1-4 people
[1:32:46] Specsifier: Man, Sunday chat is in rare form
[1:32:50] Mitchendo64: everyone mmo player who doesnt play for story is waiting for Lost Ark
[1:32:50] PToastman: still early access
[1:32:53] ElPolloBatman: bg3 is still in development
[1:32:53] PToastman: but lookin good
[1:32:53] infinityarty: @Volly ye, technically it is, but it not in the way that you need other people to complete all content
[1:32:59] MrKhanes: Baldurs Gate 3 is till in early acces
[1:33:01] speederinho: @Volly so Guild Wars 1 was no MMORPG either? ;)
[1:33:11] MOLAR305: I cant tell you the last time I didn't solo in wow lol
[1:33:12] Topazthunder: its ea game
[1:33:15] Crowargus: towel you going ham on d4 on rellease next game i looking fwd to after lost ark n wow beta
[1:33:17] Funderik: that was directed at diablo 3 being an mmo bro
[1:33:32] Angieuwwu__: Diablo and wow where one of the first best mmo and arpgs so everything is a clone of those games for those people LUL everything is a clone of a clone cause it's the same gnra insert pepega emote
[1:34:02] holymonke: i was excited for gta remaster and you can't even buy it on pc anymore lol

[1:34:36] Funderik: alot is different from the dev blogs they have put out.
[1:34:37] Algfader: Make it more like D2 probably
[1:34:47] hookkz: and way more dark like D2 so thats a plus
[1:34:48] Angieuwwu__: Open world is fun
[1:34:54] manmower: add druid back
[1:35:01] holymonke: @Topazthunder yeah its rough around the edges, bugs etc.
[1:35:07] DeanoTV: druid is in d4
[1:35:11] Funderik: it's mmo style, you get mounts too in d4, world bosses etc
[1:35:12] Topazthunder: @holymonke  PepeHands
[1:35:24] ElPolloBatman: they did announce raids in d4, but with the lead designer team changing who knows what the game will look like in the end
[1:35:25] Melonbrew: Isn't D4 going to be like Lost Ark
[1:35:30] KaisenSiru: Jammies

[1:36:19] Angieuwwu__: I like to see people running around the world it's kinda lonely and depressing been instanse like those instance games where you have to q for every zone
[1:36:30] MOLAR305: @towelliee have you watched the LoL anime on netflix? or waiting for all the episodes to come out

[1:52:00] Shamwise: Shamwise subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 106 months, currently on a 106 month streak! 
[1:52:49] king_julian_96: it’s good there not increasing the renown cap in 9.2 cause I was worried we were going to get another 40 levels and get to renown level 120 but thankfully that’s not happening
[1:52:52] hookkz: i really wish they're secretly working on WoW 2
[1:53:07] MOLAR305: I have my pally as Venthyr, hate losing ashen hollow
[1:53:19] KragnosWoW: is there a TLDR on what SoM means
[1:53:21] Skycoh: i leveled my alt to 80 renown by just doing random bgs.
[1:53:26] deeebag: @king_julian_96 there is renown just rebranded as the cypher
[1:53:41] holymonke: renown always reminded me of a battle pass lol
[1:53:48] Aquadriel: Suck On My Nuts
[1:53:56] MOLAR305: I got like 55 renown last week during comp stomp

[1:54:14] PhillyDilly18: Looking forward to trying SoM @towelliee ?
[1:54:18] holymonke: ony looks pretty hard in som
[1:54:24] PadidinJones: I think there might be a limit to how many renown you can gain from repeats. I would advise doing LFR if you don't get it now
[1:54:46] Toxaloxa: what happened to New World and your Marauders Banner????
[1:55:04] damien_: @BamBoooh I dont even think they have the talent anymore to replicate it and then create the equivalent in quality new content

[2:47:35] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @Herzenliegen you can already make 1 character so you can have your name

[2:51:25] Easymode: nah dude, we get to walk on water in 9.2, what else could we need
[2:51:35] king_julian_96: Yeah you can change covenants freely only you won’t be at the same renown level as your main covenant
[2:51:35] Plywood99: Toweliie rapping math :P
[2:51:39] Thoreya: people are the worst lmao
[2:51:42] luckfore: LUL
[2:51:43] flath: Hey Toweliie, honest question, is wow a good game to try for a new player ?
[2:51:54] Odinslayer: people just want to hate

[2:52:22] Rikuide: Going back Alliance when cross faction comes? ;)
[2:52:27] NuAera: mythic + channels were chilll
[2:52:29] grapyz: streamers were like getting accused lol
[2:52:29] 0gtone: if you don't have haters you are doing something wrong
[2:52:30] Thunderbrew: I wonder why people are mad at Blizzard? Kappa
[2:52:45] malddktank: @Rikuide is cross faction confirmed?
[2:52:47] smrtihlav1985: wow is best
[2:52:51] metrobeams: which is better wow or wow classic
[2:52:52] Ghostzapp3r: I cant wait to watch the disaster of Hardcore on SoM. Watching Joker get griefed by an infernal is yikes

[2:52:55] kiziamizia2: 80
[2:52:58] MOLAR305: apparently any Activision channel was getting attacked even people playing candy crush...
[2:53:06] Rikuide: @Rikuide nope, but surely lol...
[2:53:17] GarfielfArbuncle: I just hope 10.0 launches in a better state than Shadowlands did. Don't need a million systems, just give us TBC-MoP gearing and badges pleeeease.
[2:53:20] Ghostzapp3r: yep..

[2:54:20] ribose1982: Do you think we will get 9.2 before xmas?
[2:54:32] king_julian_96: Blizz pulled the ripcord but also didn’t fully pull it cause while there might not be any ristrictions on covenant swapping you will not be at same renown as your main covenant sadly
[2:54:34] Ldysansa: Look for us who have played WOW for yearssss. We are loyal that doesn't mean we can't be disappointed in decisions the organization makes. As long as they straight out their stuff there reason to talk crap. Just saying.
[2:54:34] Pallananana: GLORIA SwiftRage

[2:56:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Is there going to be a 9.3?
[2:56:22] MOLAR305: I'm surprised they didn't go running the break the "in case of emergency break glass" that is arthas
[2:56:28] Thunderbrew: I'm interested in 10.0 and Lich King Classic. I wanna try a Lich King Disc Priest.
[2:56:29] holymonke: depends what you like. classic and retail are different beasts
[2:56:48] BlinkHeals: Well they cant really give up on it they need the story to end right for the next expac
[2:56:51] GarfielfArbuncle: @MOLAR305 There's a shot in the trailer where everyone Arthas hurt most is standing there, it's obvious he's gonna pop in.
[2:56:55] Shrenko: I stayed subbed for Draenor longer than I did for Shadowlands LUL
[2:56:56] Easymode: draenor but 4 garrisons towPog
[2:57:05] king_julian_96: Do you think we will get the next wow expac announcement when 9.2 comes out towelliee
[2:57:16] holymonke: its crazy overwatch 2 is still a year out lol
[2:57:17] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HFC saved WoD
[2:57:20] Thunderbrew: IMO Warlords is better then Shadowlands.
[2:57:20] mediocretees: which do you think is a better new player experience? Retail or classic?
[2:57:34] GarfielfArbuncle: WoD at least had fun raids, I'm not feeling the SLands ones at all.
[2:57:35] MOLAR305: @garfielfarbuncle I know but if they wanted the pop to get people coming back he would have been in the developer reveal vid
[2:57:38] metrobeams: @BamBoooh ahh never played this game so i was just wondering i wanted to start playing always wanted to
[2:57:44] Zolshy89: How to sound like an ADDICT KEKW
[2:57:49] valth: shadowlands is the expansion that made me quit WOW. no other expansion caused that to happen.
[2:57:53] LV730: What did you play in the 4 month period? :)
[2:57:53] malddktank: @GarfielfArbuncle i loved castle nathria, SoD not so much
[2:57:57] Thunderbrew: For today's players I would say Retail
[2:58:04] PhatyBoy: Thats sad because Shadowlands has so much potential

[2:59:11] PhatyBoy: I think New World will be around for a long time
[2:59:26] BlinkHeals: @BlastingHookTTV if not it will be their biggest loss for sure
[2:59:27] GarfielfArbuncle: SWTOR's a bit light on content, mostly just play for story and because I like Star Wars.
[2:59:28] zulufucxz: ever thing about playing ESO?
[2:59:48] GarfielfArbuncle: SWTOR's next expansion is looking a bit rough, lot of ability pruning.

[3:06:37] Neviriah: WoW has awesome graphics in its own way ^_^ i think
[3:06:51] Specsifier: A unique art style always beats a hyper realistic detailed one for me
[3:07:01] Specsifier: WoW and 14 both have a great unique style
[3:07:01] Mitchendo64: I loved 1. 2 and 3 were men 4 was great and 5 is awesome so far

[3:09:12] ZakuzaGB: they should do like a gladiotor stadium
[3:09:21] wpanic: What should be a good end for wow game? The game is almost 17 years i think, it could be dead or ended in few years, what do you think about it @Towelliee

[3:10:26] iblighters: They're adding a luck bonus for being flagged
[3:10:28] zuna1904: @wPanic whats the point of ending something that still profitable ?
[3:10:31] Molvonos: There's no real point in contesting with how their system is set up.
[3:10:41] mute_paladin: What I have seen more in New World is Companies fighting each other over other Companies transferring.
[3:10:47] KillaPr0: covenant and marauder

[3:13:11] manmower: wars seem to be decided before they even start based on the compositions in the wars
[3:13:25] Molvonos: Purple had to cheat to get their territories and when they fixed the exploits, imagine that, they couldn't fucking keep em.
[3:13:39] ZakuzaGB: would it have been worth doing like a season reset for 9.1.5 or no point

[3:22:17] Demanisraar: no scaling on them no
[3:22:18] Jeanssi: "great"... like 120 mounts already compared to less than 100 in whole BfA. Dunno if that counts as great, it's just bloat, recolor after recolor

[4:34:00] fistofnature: gotta put base item first

[4:35:10] Wrizzik: @deathoog taylor ham = canadian bacon = porkroll
[4:35:11] 3663Sharad: Crafting your second leggy during 9.1.5 should be a good start for 9.2 right?
[4:35:23] zgag: Towelliee. What been your thoughts on Carson Wentz so far

[4:37:52] luckfore: look like quest gear :\
[4:37:55] Nokterian: Blackrock Tier Sets
[4:37:56] blasphemous_crow: same
[4:37:58] MasterDursk: i think it depends on the effects of the glowing parts
[4:37:59] Nokterian: perfection
[4:38:08] Basic_BS: I kinda like the plates, still meh though
[4:38:16] luckfore: hope it was early version
[4:38:17] blasphemous_crow: You hear about the Cosmic 3D Printer?
[4:38:19] Orion280: i quite like the DK one
[4:38:24] PToastman: I dont like that they are all the same color
[4:38:33] whtrabbitt: maybe there will be nice re-colors
[4:38:45] FireEmblemLord: warrior tier sets are always god tier in design
[4:38:45] flebbooo: i mean they did that before by taking abit of inspiration from the raids but atleast those tier sets still had unique looks across the classes
[4:38:46] ZakuzaGB: tier sets are meant to be based on the class not the raid environment etc
[4:38:47] axellent_x: Bro the warriors set got that them elephantitis shoulders, they’re fuckin huge compared to the rest
[4:38:48] MasterDursk: if the paladin one looks like Tyrael from Diablo im fine with it.
[4:38:59] Sayryn: Sayryn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[4:39:04] MasterDursk: with the concept art of paladins it looks good
[4:39:16] MasterDursk: in terms of overall the base looks terrible
[4:39:18] jMs_Vibez: I'm sorry but its BS , but the other thing why i'm so upset is they are proud on those sets ! 'those amazing set tiers ' c'mon man xD
[4:39:23] blasphemous_crow: Morgan talked about it in an interview, apparently the First Ones used them to make Eternals and shit.
[4:39:25] MasterDursk: but with the effects it could be good
[4:39:25] Nokterian: I liked the BlackRock Foundry tier sets
[4:39:31] cinnamints: I'm eh on some, but the shammy helm is one of the coolest pieces the class has ever gotten, and they have some great sets.
[4:39:32] Nokterian: even Tomb of Sargeras
[4:39:33] Felrane: the lore of shadowlands just takes a huge dump on warcraft 3/wrath and the universe itself lol
[4:39:34] ZakuzaGB: always seems like they know what we want but they cant deliver it
[4:39:34] fistofnature: my man really dissing Trial of the crusader sets? 😡
[4:39:37] MasterDursk: true
[4:39:43] ThisIzD: The cloth bod set is pretty lit
[4:39:43] FireEmblemLord: the priest set for ulduar is good through
[4:39:47] luckfore: antorus had best sets
[4:39:59] death_cam_: hopefully they look better with the other color variants
[4:40:00] MasterDursk: i think it really depends on the effects if the effects are lacking they are going to be bad
[4:40:14] jMs_Vibez: true
[4:40:14] PvtHudson093: Pls give a HD Paladin tier 2 set
[4:40:18] MasterDursk: venthyr looks good
[4:40:19] jMs_Vibez: first sets are alright
[4:40:20] axellent_x: I thought the shaman one was for sure the monks lmao,
[4:40:24] fistofnature: venthyr is 10/10
[4:40:28] MasterDursk: i hated nya unless mythic
[4:40:34] MasterDursk: same with bod
[4:40:46] MasterDursk: yea the actual old tiers are good

[4:41:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: T2 was good
[4:41:09] Nokterian: LUL
[4:41:10] theDirtyon3: so low res KEKW
[4:41:13] Nokterian: BANANA POWAH
[4:41:21] jorrih: tier 2 bis forever
[4:41:22] espenenenen: that looks so bad on tauren
[4:41:26] PvtHudson093: T2 was the shit
[4:41:26] Wrizzik: Justicar >>>>
[4:41:30] TakeThatBack: judgement will always be my fav
[4:41:33] NewWorldReign: what is the worst tier set for paladin to you @Towelliee ?
[4:41:33] Nokterian: 2.5 was eeeh
[4:41:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 2.5 very sus
[4:41:39] cinnamints: @fistofnature That entire Covenant/zone is all-around one of the best things they've done IMO. Everything looks great, is interesting & fun.
[4:41:39] Wrizzik: errr....Judgment. Yeah
[4:41:40] ArcaneSyntax: 2.5 might be the worst tier theyve ever done.
[4:41:58] Oaties_: 9.2 rogue set looks pretty cool imo
[4:42:02] Sylnus: Am I wrong for really liking the 9.2 tier sets?
[4:42:13] ZakuzaGB: its crazy that all they need to do is look at their previous work and thats what we want but they still dont get it right haha
[4:42:13] PvtHudson093: 2.5 wasnt made for horde body shapes
[4:42:17] lucynsol: Firelands was good when it came to sticking to theme with raid
[4:42:18] fistofnature: @cinnamints agree
[4:42:19] MasterDursk: the bad part about recent "tier" sets is that it sucks unless mythic. I have gotten CE, but its still not good overall. I mean heroic should be at least a little better than its been its like heoric 2/10 then mythic 10/10
[4:42:19] CrusaderNero: I like the 9.2 sets too
[4:42:22] luckfore: ur current mog looks cool
[4:42:24] Nokterian: Legion version is great
[4:42:27] Molvonos: It was their first attempt at being lazy as fuck
[4:42:35] death_cam_: you going for the timewalking mage tower recolor
[4:42:44] Taz_85: Tier 3 looked awesome for some classes
[4:42:49] Nokterian: the mythic look so good
[4:42:49] theDirtyon3: you can farm maiden now

[4:43:09] Odinslayer: 8th of dec
[4:43:49] kuiper_ow: @Towelliee are u going for the mage tower mount?
[4:43:51] Northrad: why does wow always try to release anything on the same days or close to the days that other games come out with major content updates lmao

[4:44:34] CrusaderNero: they aint releasing shit
[4:44:48] Aidler: sounds like a plan
[4:44:49] CrusaderNero: 9.2 is like months away
[4:45:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: do you have nalak and galleon mount already?
[4:45:15] glob710: They tried to line up SoM with endwalker
[4:45:26] funKShun: LULW
[4:45:34] luckfore: pussies now
[4:45:38] manmower: floyd mayweather strategy
[4:45:52] funKShun: bunch of pussies, they know that content sux ballz
[4:45:58] cordawg: 9.2 is garbage
[4:45:59] PvtHudson093: Legion TW should last a full month
[4:46:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: COPIUM
[4:46:08] NewWorldReign: 9.2 probably the best one they made for a while?
[4:46:29] Spookyboogy1: 9.2 really doesnt look impressive; especially from a writing stand point, they SHOULD be worried
[4:46:34] Northrad: would 9.2 be worth coming back to the game?
[4:46:48] Complete_Phased: Mage Tower comes out around Endwalker launch
[4:46:49] deeebag: idk 9.2 dont look like much different to me.  im probably waiting for the next xpac
[4:47:05] Basic_BS: No one played 9.2, how the fuck would we know
[4:47:10] diogtex: You're saying that as it's a bad thing. Competition make better games
[4:47:12] Miertez: no one can compete with that water
[4:47:12] Spookyboogy1: Devs said " we have been wanting to bring tier sets for awhile and we are happy to announce their return" ok if you wanted them back why didnt you jsut add them, YOU MAKE THE GAME @Towelliee
[4:47:29] flebbooo: i just checked and Heavensward and 6.2 for wow came out on the same day KEKW
[4:47:44] manmower: isn't that standard for a bully
[4:47:45] luckfore: maybe they can do that with 10.0 and onwards again, i hope
[4:47:46] CujoAttacks: I thought about getting caught up for 9.2 but I think i'll be waiting for the next xpac instead
[4:47:52] belfastcl: @Spookyboogy1 not all devs might've had the same opinion, he could be speaking for the branch of devs that did
[4:48:12] ThaOriginalGamester: 🥺 Please resub and play - Blizzard
[4:48:19] Complete_Phased: I remember when Battleborn came out and that same weekend Blizz released Overwatch beta and basically screwed Battleborn
[4:48:26] Putcride: @Towelliee i think it was 8.2 bfa with azaraha
[4:48:28] Oaties_: I still WAY prefer WoW over all the other mmo's. Ive tried most of the big ones and cant get along with them
[4:48:40] DerxGamin: a pokemon mmo - the true wow killer
[4:48:45] theDirtyon3: Riot MMO Kreygasm
[4:48:47] lucynsol: they confirmed they're making an mmo correct?
[4:48:48] Northrad: ^
[4:48:49] DrWraithjr: LUL the mental image
[4:48:58] NewWorldReign: Do you think the MMORPG competition has gone through the roof compared to previous years?
[4:49:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: It is -13F outside right now here. :)
[4:49:03] manmower: Riot said their MMO isn't a WoW killer, it's a Blizzard killer
[4:49:03] flebbooo: one day Pokemon, one day COPIUM
[4:49:08] N3llee: Riot seems still far off from the vibes i get from Max. His gf works for them
[4:49:21] iamjooba: pokemmo is out, its good but nothing will kill WoW but WoW
[4:49:23] unresolved_broccoli: Pokemon will always be P  2  W
[4:49:23] MasterDursk: final fantasy a realm reborn came out a month before mists of pandaria
[4:49:29] gnarlychicken3: pokemon just needs to do like a tft game
[4:49:33] death_cam_: wouldnt a pokemon mmo just be pet battles?
[4:49:36] ArcaneSyntax: it's almost like making an MMO is really hard
[4:49:38] ThaOriginalGamester: The Pokemon Company and Nintendo don't want to display how toxic their playerbase can be... they refuse to embrace online communities lol
[4:49:43] RogueBear: maybe its an off take but i think the pokemon MMO is PokemonGO?
[4:49:49] ViljoBenzo: So hard to try out new MMOs because you always compare it to WoW. Regardles the state of WoW rn it's the best video game ever made, so it's so hard to find any othet that comes even close @Towelliee
[4:49:53] MasterDursk: august for a realm reborn and september for mop
[4:50:03] notorietyy: wow is doing a very good job of killing itself at the moment
[4:50:03] MasterDursk: wait
[4:50:06] MasterDursk: wrong year kekw
[4:50:06] ArcaneSyntax: @death_cam_ pet battles have like 1/500th the complexity of pokemon battles.
[4:50:06] robertjordan83: @Towelliee thoughts on the trilogy shadowlands story claim? personally, i think 9.2 was supposed to be 9.3 and 9.2 was supposed to be a uladar type story with the brokers
[4:50:24] MasterDursk: nvm
[4:50:27] MasterDursk: it was awhile
[4:50:28] d1stract10n: CAP
[4:50:38] MasterDursk: ignore me
[4:50:43] DoA_Satellite: riot made a career from unabashedly cloning other games and slapping waifus on them
[4:50:44] luckfore: D: liars
[4:50:49] Northrad: they gave up on SL
[4:50:53] BrotherBeezy: "We tried to tell a 4 part story in 3 parts and this is the final act"
[4:50:56] Fatpally: sup chat hope all are having a good morning/evening
[4:51:02] snipsfan: people now feel like they don't need to play wow only. they can have fun in other games snd still come bavk to wow when they feel it's good
[4:51:08] death_cam_: didnt they say sl wont be another wod
[4:51:10] martacus423: @DoA_Satellite sooooooo TRUE
[4:51:11] gnarlychicken3: pokemon just needs to make an auto chess game honestly
[4:51:19] gurunoni: Is Legion raids easier to do after patch. Love legion transmog.
[4:51:24] Spookyboogy1: @belfastcl  While that may be true it comes across wrong to announce that the way they did when its the devs saying omg we wanted this back so excited to have it!   idk it felt liek froced salesmanship *which that dev preview was, forced wexcitement
[4:51:30] Northrad: they need more time to make the next expac so we dont have another SL
[4:51:32] DragonValius: DragonValius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:51:35] anguishxx: is there a prediction for what next expac will be
[4:51:36] CrunkyBrewster: it almost sounds like they're doing a reboot
[4:51:36] Spookyboogy1: @hawkhawk7 100% Steve danuser sucks
[4:51:48] MasterDursk: it came out a month before seige
[4:51:48] lucynsol: I did it yesterday on mythic, super eeeeasy
[4:51:49] Broomba: KEKW
[4:51:52] theDirtyon3: yeah I get stuck on Avatar
[4:51:57] FireEmblemLord: at least we have ffxiv to go to while we wait
[4:51:59] theDirtyon3: fuck that thing
[4:51:59] luckfore: yea thats one thing they didnt pull the ripcord on legion tuning is still way off

[4:52:51] mandilozano: well remember in wrath they made the dragon raid after the lich king, maybe they'll do something similar
[4:52:59] ArcaneSyntax: probably like the condition of the servers now: trash
[4:53:00] CDubTheRIPper: flask*
[4:53:04] Imtheguy15: powerlvled my armoring from 120 to 200 over last 2 nights lot of fiber farming
[4:53:04] Spookyboogy1: Remember when sylvanus tautned  us/the alliance/horde that we could never  understand her plans or motivations for 2 expansions and then she didnt realize or understand her plans either  LOL
[4:53:10] Galkresh: I've more faith in FF launch than a WoW launch right now as far as quality content goes
[4:53:12] BadFoxtrot: If Endwalker flops I'm losing all hope LUL

[4:53:59] torr0x: how dare you make me re download wow after MONTHS of not even thinking about it
[4:54:01] Northrad: SL launch was actually good. it was the day after launch where the game started to get bad
[4:54:02] SuperTech_: Toweliee riding the cock again?
[4:54:04] PvtHudson093: poor Chimkin
[4:54:07] Broomba: truth dot com

[5:10:26] Felrane: Blizz loves wasting content. Argus could have been its own expo. N'zoth/black empire. And now Zereth Mortis
[5:10:26] andy_4000: @Cookiedropz lol I'm multi-tasking so i probably just skimmed through what you said
[5:10:36] mySire: dead ppl farming mounts :9
[5:10:51] Todmeister9000: he knows
[5:10:57] FresheFefe: old buddy n'zoth
[5:10:58] NewWorldReign: How many times has Sylvanas died in lore, and yet she says Death comes for US? Kappa
[5:11:00] Hoodicon: I support the jailer and his motives
[5:11:05] vylh: lmao
[5:11:06] wazon_7: what if we comeback to azeroth after SL and see all 4 old gods alive snacking azeroth
[5:11:07] flebbooo: we never left nyalotha monkaS
[5:11:09] Cookiedropz: @requis_l97 lol np, was saying i get no ads in response to ppl saying they do. Netflix has even said that if you do, you have adware infection basically lol
[5:11:10] Broomba: i read on reddit that the island bois will be the last boss to kill in SL KEKW
[5:11:13] Aeylid: illidan did nothing wrong
[5:11:15] Felrane: N'zoth did say only he can save us. Perhaps he wanted free from the Void Lords and we helped him free himself
[5:11:23] roachred: before 9.0 came out there were a lot of questions about time jumps.. wonder if that's still possible
[5:11:38] Todmeister9000: Arthas did nothing wrong

[5:12:15] fistofnature: what 1000 attempts does to a mf
[5:12:33] BigD530: just due to what Zereth Mortis is supposed to be, it could have the potential of being a central plot point for a long time to come
[5:12:36] wazon_7: the purpose of this shaman is to be reanimated once a week to kill the t-rex  KEKW
[5:12:49] Aeylid: old god becomes pet and 4 pet become new old gods
[5:12:55] Felrane: @BigD530 naw blizz loves its one and done content

[5:13:58] pokemictcg: i need help with something
[5:13:59] VapuArt: ah did i mention that sargeras is about to grab his sword out of azeroth cause illidan let him free and he will kill zoval and then might the world change

[5:15:28] manmower: we gotta fight the jailer and rip off his gauntlet in the final fight
[5:15:30] Colt_Engineer: I wanted sylvanas to die so badly, now she's just chilling
[5:15:30] ashwing_: So Avengers Endgame basically LUL
[5:15:32] BigD530: they still have to explain the POSSIBLE ulterior motives of Turalyon
[5:15:32] Spookyboogy1: @scudo13  yeah cause the writing/plot has been really bad recently its gonna take some GOOD SHIT to change peoples minds
[5:15:38] Djfarmville: Zovaal wins, so the eternal ones engineer a new world for us and voila wow 2
[5:15:44] OlympicPNW: All this time in the MAW just for him to win?

[5:15:56] I_DoctorSatan_I: Cyberdine Systems became fully aware!! POG
[5:15:58] CrunkyBrewster: I was thinking Realm Rebornish
[5:16:05] un_original: most ppl dont even know who zovaal is, what his friggin motivations are and why this is happening...
[5:16:07] wazon_7: he already won. As far as we know he is atleast as strong as the titans or stronger, and he is full power right now. We barely beat a giga supressed argus with help of entire pantheon. How are we going to beat the jailer without any "divine/cosmic" help? we dont
[5:16:08] PToastman: "Puny mortals! I did it thirty five minutes ago!"
[5:16:11] Djfarmville: Yea he wins and we kill him and then go to our new home
[5:16:11] mrelgaato: @Aeylid np m8. kind of not right Aeylid without a sub)
[5:16:16] EthosHowl: zoval wins, and lets us know nzoth killed us all
[5:16:17] chukudu: @Towelliee do you think we will see Fatescribe Roh-Kalo's brother in 9.2 ? Fatescribe Roh-Sualo
[5:16:18] neugassh: i have little to zero faith in them so doesnt really matter i guess
[5:16:23] spiked16: a copy of the world is created but everything mixed up
[5:16:27] emilioh99: and where even are the first ones?
[5:16:29] manmower: we thinking wow is getting a new engine sometime soon?
[5:16:32] jackymoon: i feel we will be going into the Future
[5:16:36] ijuki: @Aeylid was without a sub and I didn't notice PepeHands
[5:16:39] DaVeGaLiSoT: Disney buys Activision and Wow gets merged into the MCU
[5:16:44] wolf4you1978: A fake heaven for control
[5:16:49] ChumbaWumba6943: what we do is, we go back to jaina and use her magic to go back in time for a time heist to get the sigils
[5:16:52] NewWorldReign: We're still high from N'Zoth city fumes, so yeah.
[5:16:54] crashoverride_gaming: 10.0 “Andrew gets up, then we will all get up, it will be anarchy!”
[5:17:03] manmower: maybe big Chromie role
[5:17:07] CrunkyBrewster: WoW gets merged into Kingdom Hearts Uni
[5:17:18] RogueBear: alternate timeline where the horde crushed the alliance during the first invasion through the dark portal Kappa
[5:17:19] Jarlan23: ive always hated time travel shit. it throws in too many plot holes in everything
[5:17:22] ShadowbladeRai: Dragon isles?!?!
[5:17:26] BigD530: Zovaal wins, Azeroth changed irreparably, and rebuild and colonize Elunaria?
[5:17:26] spiked16: or maybe we go back to the past before sylvanas opens the sky
[5:17:27] Ellorg: I would like to see them include some kind of Boss starcraft related since there are zerglings and other starcraft things in the game
[5:17:27] usmcvet95: If only the WoW team was competent enough for all this
[5:17:31] Densetsu_: @Towelliee Do you have any dream features you would like to see for 10.0? Or just some things you really want to see.
[5:17:32] Dhazran: Sup Towelliee!
[5:17:33] neugassh: what if we go back to before the sundering?
[5:17:34] ChumbaWumba6943: tbh i thought dragons lost their powers after cata
[5:17:35] DallTV_: the jailer kills chromie
[5:17:43] Spookyboogy1: A big problem is this expac has been so low on motivations. WE still dont know why sylvanus trusted the wow equivalent of SATAN ; we still dont exactly know the jailers plan persay "rewrite universe"  ok, what does that mean, entail, etc? isnt it telling that half of players WANT the jailor to win?  @Towelliee
[5:17:46] tehrobtar: come on, @Towelliee give us your best chromie voice :P
[5:17:46] axellent_x: They can’t mess with goldshire, moon guards gonna be pissed

[5:46:32] Jarlan23: Honestly the only thing that could get me interested in WoW again is if they did somethign like youre describing
[5:46:36] tawil_at_umr: they could always do a rush job and spend next three patches fixing the rush job @Towelliee

[5:48:29] Jarlan23: thats why its always a mistake to introduce time travel
[5:48:42] stryngs_: they get paid and dont even play the game
[5:48:42] Lantern214: @Towelliee Or the Jailor just wins and snaps his finger, and saves us from Nezoth
[5:48:42] UltimaWeap: yeah Steve's job in jeopardy
[5:48:45] nightshadewoww: Jailer trying to fix all bad things that happened and we want to kill him WutFace

[5:48:55] Aidler: khadgar teleports everything away luxthoKEK
[5:49:06] x_Parl_x: Chromie pulls a Dr. Strange and knows the only one way we can defeat the jailer. Anduin becomes the next jailer like bolvar became the next Lich King. #copypasta

[5:49:44] jordeon123: Some had their sub paid for with the lifetime passes but thats not really relevant
[5:49:46] Kisswani: I hope they dont go the Archimonde way of ending the jailer where the souls just rush him to blow him up
