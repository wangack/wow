[3:26:35] Telomir: Rogue dmg nerf didnt accomplish much because rogue dmg wasnt the problem to begin with. Its about UTILITY - as long as their utility remains unphased, couple that with the goal of MDI (speed runs) and they'll still be invited. Lets hope for dungeon redesign in 9.0 which utilizes other classes' utility and base toolkits buffed to encourage more MDI diversity.
