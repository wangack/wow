[2:07:44] estebanstrangiato: that run is fine if you just stay on the road

[2:07:45] ExaUnique: Dan already installed them mods that warn you of danger?
[2:07:47] estebanstrangiato: unless theres PVP
[2:07:58] shadows_embrace_you: You just have to be careful when going through wetlands. Just use your pet as distraction if need be

[2:10:12] procyon_mfc: darkshore does have alot of good quests for you
[2:10:13] Xierany: @smashlord4000 Just delays your death really. Done the skip twice and it gets easier with level and pets. Or just a higher level to clear crocs
[2:10:32] Herethos: no more quests left in the area to level up a bit first?

[2:22:30] AleNarro: xhipotPop
[2:22:33] doinglurkstuff: On a hardcore server, I think reaching 60 would merit an achievement called, "I survived."
[2:22:33] Flecked: dont need a title
[2:22:40] Corvin_Tom: no end game?
[2:22:42] DarkBlueManta: did Dan just take a bite out of his desk? dan4Head

[2:24:12] InternetNoLife: Seems fine to me.
[2:24:14] doinglurkstuff: @Kennaay No achievements in Classic? Why did people want to go back to "Vanilla"? Seems like there was a LOT of updates for QoL that improved over the years.

[2:24:56] Kennaay: @doinglurkstuff Nostalgia and its more challenging generally, Wrath is out right now for Classic which is when they introduced achievements and a lot fo the modern fixes. Hardcore is only on Vanilla Classic

[2:44:09] Toon11: Dan has already tested this theory LUL
[2:44:12] m4gnify: most noobs play it
[2:44:12] Dragtox: hunter is most played wich is why most hunter died
[2:44:15] Nekros4442: @DansGaming To be fair that could also just means there's more hunters than anyn other class
[2:44:15] mogel78: danB
[2:44:16] Zeel0t: in eu its warriors lol
[2:44:16] AverageSizedTarp: just feign death 4Head
[2:44:18] darkmanx30: So no hunter tank
[2:44:19] pbourey75: My guess is that most people play hunters hench the most deaths
[2:44:20] bob_3002: You gotta divide that by the rate they're played to get actual stats
[2:44:20] Littlemayne: Having escapes is important for hardcore. Like mage and rogue
[2:44:21] Brololski: its also the most played class, so yeah
[2:44:23] harpoonie: Is that per popula?
[2:44:24] FlyguyJP: Are Hunters at least fun to play
[2:44:27] skidm0: Pre 10 Hunter dies really often
[2:44:33] shadows_embrace_you: Hunter would also be the most popular class so it evens out
[2:44:36] Upshift: But I wonder if thats just because theyre the most chosen class
[2:44:39] DefiantQaid: as a hunter it's easy to get yourself into situations that will kill you
[2:44:44] Kei_L: LUL
[2:44:45] elscarface1: danKEK2
[2:44:45] Dragtox: @DansGaming that ratio is based on what class people played the most
[2:44:46] GoldIncome: probably because hunter is popular

[2:44:47] supposeppo80: @Dragtox i played it alot and alliance won always

[2:44:53] Oarens: AMOGUS facts
[2:44:54] mogel78: danLove
[2:45:02] RiPTide: Hunters die more because people don't know how to play. By default the class requires a lot of micromanagement to manage pets/survivability in "oh shit" situations.
[2:45:03] Alloces: what about gnomes?
[2:45:06] pbourey75: Nice
[2:45:06] macadoww: your pet may aggro many mobs
[2:45:08] Akvahenrik: Why would they call an expansion "to be confirmed" danNope
[2:45:08] JohnLeMay: they also feign death alot more.

[2:45:13] Nelciel: @RainRioken danKEK2
[2:45:14] Wrenton: Its actually false. Your better off playing Warrior or Paladin, but mostly Paladin because Plate armor and Pallys get a heal spell
[2:45:15] Jimwh0: Ass facts danYes
[2:45:16] GoldIncome: if 40% of the server are hunters, I bet the ratio per class is higher
[2:45:17] ODDtheFool: They showed it at blizzcon, Hunters followed by Warriors KEKW
[2:45:28] BeardAndPipe: probably the most recommended for noobs, so more noobs playing equals more deaths
[2:45:31] FlyguyJP: My sources that it came to me in a dream danNotes
[2:45:35] Nekros4442: .....You are not better off playing Warrior. Warrior is easily the worst class to play solo
[2:45:48] ghsteo: Yeah warrior is hard solo
[2:45:52] Dragtox: @supposeppo80 y thats why horde played it less but later on horde learned strategy and alliance did not want to learn counter strategy danFine
[2:45:58] mogel78: Hunter, warlock, mage have the most utility
[2:46:01] juckjeckel: uhh, warriors have the highest % of reaching 60
[2:46:10] pbourey75: Warriors can be insane at 60 but getting them geared to that point is rough
[2:46:12] chibougamo: What class has least mortality?
[2:46:16] supposeppo80: @Dragtox i must stopped playing by then
[2:46:20] Hiffi: scan auction @DansGaming so you can see on items last price there was on AH

[2:46:23] Kei_L: @juckjeckel I bet they all had heal bots SHRUG
[2:46:24] mogel78: Druid being a close second but in classic they are weak

[2:47:43] mogel78: @juckjeckel warriors are op once geared but very gear dependant with alot of down time pre 60
[2:47:50] TutturuTV: @juckjeckel yeah but they need gear LuL
[2:47:53] Hiffi: @DansGaming no but for when you are in the world and something drops you can see instantly what price of that item could be on AH and scan is quick

[5:51:56] BossaSuperNova: @mcburger8 danKEK
[5:51:58] Cruduxy: sounds like their issue
[5:52:00] Snuggles09: Sometimes I wonder if these raid groups practice in non-hardcore to get mechanics down, then get on hardcore for the kill
[5:52:01] kokochris: Blizzard will not res.  It tells you when you create a character
[5:52:05] vegemiteappreciator: I look forward to Dan backstabbing his raid in Naxx like that one guild
[5:52:07] Garthinx: remember that famous rogue guy killing everyone getting off the boat ?
[5:52:08] TheColdAge: That's why I'm an hunter I'll pull all the shit and run away like a coward danKappa
[5:52:11] Zimmy99: The ultimate troll, piss of 39 ppl danKappa
[5:52:12] gigemnorm: does that tend to eliminate dungeons or do you just wait until you have overlevelled?
[5:52:19] Lotare: I wonder how many will troll asmon into dying
[5:52:39] ghsteo: there is a flask of petrification that makes you immune for a minute but cant move. its used as a wipe prevention mainly
[5:52:51] Cruduxy: gigemnorm coordinated teams can do them others nope
[5:52:53] DacePerado: Petri petri petri danMad
[5:53:19] ghsteo: you leave party, use a petri flask and you get teleported out after 60 secs
[5:53:27] vegemiteappreciator: Alchemists in classic must be rich
[5:53:45] jdotno: no
[5:53:50] CrowCawl: wowzers lvl 17
[5:53:50] Rhea_the_Cat: You pop and drop raid then get ported in 1 min
[5:54:00] DacePerado: Depends on the boss, and how it was pulled but usually some people are guaranteed to die
[5:54:12] BossaSuperNova: @vegemiteappreciator I was just wondering that. If potions are priced sky high in hardcore mode? danHmm
[5:54:12] SoulCrusher842: 24hr stream? Pog
[5:54:25] DiggerDempsey: cozy
[5:54:32] vegemiteappreciator: @BossaSuperNova Thes petrification ones are danGnome
[5:54:33] tenthousand: petri duration is shorter than tp out timer so people usually end up die
[5:54:36] ghsteo: yeah
[5:54:42] OuroborosChemist: hmm so how do you raid black temple in BC hardcore?
[5:54:47] BossaSuperNova: @vegemiteappreciator danNice
[5:54:47] CrowCawl: leave group THEN petri
[5:54:48] ghsteo: normally happens when tank or heals die
[5:54:50] CyorZ3: you gotta leave group, wait for the countdown, then petri
[5:54:56] TrebleZX: no, you leave party then wait till the counter appears then pop petri, otherwise you will die to the adds @DansGaming
[5:55:11] DonReiniero: How much is a petri flask though must be like a 1000g
[5:55:16] DiggerDempsey: BillyApprove
[5:55:21] Zimmy99: danNotes
[5:55:22] Zimpaa: what happens if you petrify yourself and alt+f4?
[5:55:29] Jormungander1: so wich lvl is dan now.....and how many death?

[5:56:11] Aerodozz: how do you get the buff?
[5:56:14] elscarface1: danNice danNice
[5:56:17] DacePerado: Yeah there is no way to raid and guarantee no one dies
[5:56:31] TrebleZX: yes
[5:56:35] ghsteo: yeah
[5:56:36] Chroma_bx: Before attempting a major raid, you still have to do a lot of dungeons. Maybe I think it help to clear player that not serious about the HC mode
[5:56:51] ghsteo: yeah Anthony died cause he did it wrong
[5:57:03] jaykazu: Sometimes you gotta find a window to use a second potion to have the extra time if the mobs go away from you for a bit
[5:57:04] TrebleZX: people often die because they mistime petri
[5:57:08] DacePerado: Plus people often panic if it suddenly goes wrong and they misclick
[5:57:11] Talins: if you mess up the timing you can use 2 petri flasks in a row, for 2 minutes, but thats not cheap
[5:57:22] husby123: danBobble

[5:57:54] BossaSuperNova: SMOrc All ogre
[5:57:57] voidnn: Leave the raid if you don't trust the tank/healer
[5:57:58] loquoi: RL simulator ?
[5:58:00] ghsteo: @Talins theres a brief frame delay though with reapplying the new one. So if an enemy is beating on you they can hit you in that frame the buff getss re-applied. What happened to Anthony
[5:58:03] SaulGoodman_: Just stay in Elwynn forest and kill boars
[5:58:11] zlottee: danMad danKnife

[5:58:59] TrebleZX: @DansGaming also you gotta be very careful about your pet in dungeons or raid, if you jump down to another area the pet will take the longest route to follow you and will aggro everything
[5:59:02] hazy_v: dan deletes this channel if this character dies
[5:59:04] CrowCawl: There was a time in AQ 40 where I accidentally pulled all the bugs in that one hallway the respawn super fast and wiped the raid by feign deathing lol

[6:31:26] InternetNoLife: Water danS
[6:31:34] Liquefiedmatter: @Cruduxy Really? I thought it was just that they would disable the AH, shops etc. So that you can only use and equip items and equipment you make yourself.
[6:31:40] Cruduxy: If they want to make it extra hardcore just remove world buffs danKappa
[6:31:55] Cruduxy: Liquefiedmatter no in games like PoE SSF means no team play
[6:31:57] valianya: Cohh's reaction the first time he heard an AI voice quesst was gold

[6:32:33] elboobster: Is it ai of really fans that recorded all thé dialogues?
[6:32:39] Alanaze: Still better than reading KKona
[6:32:46] Liquefiedmatter: @Cruduxy Right but didn't Blizz reveal they would make an offical hardcore mode where you can still group, but everything else is self made?
[6:32:47] Kalderasch: If I was a thousands of years old nightelf, I wouldn't care that much in my voice, either.
[6:33:00] nitechill: still beats reading it all! totally worth it
[6:33:01] LootGoblinGrenade: having the quest text like an audiobook is fantastic

[6:34:27] Furlough: garrisons were so cool
[6:34:35] DrWraithjr: It was great
[6:34:38] Kalderasch: Warlords of Draenor just lacked content, thus garrisons were overused.
[6:34:38] ghsteo: housing like DAoC would have been great
[6:34:40] talisaurus: I want another game with UO type housing Sadge
[6:34:46] EddyStylez: player/guild cities Pog
[6:34:50] MissMokoko: Garrison was fun on one character, not so much on alts...
[6:34:51] Porkbutt1984: danHype class halls were fun

[6:35:27] TheSolree: Hey, that crystal wasn't voiced! danRage
[6:35:29] Liquefiedmatter: warfronts was an ambitious idea, weren't they going to have many more warfronts but we ended up with only 2?
[6:35:38] TheSteventh: legion classic danSus
[6:35:47] metalwrath22222: dragonflight classic

[6:36:00] Kalderasch: @TheSteventh I'd love that. Legion was my fav expansion
[6:36:03] ItsJustMeABC: WoD would ave been great if it was only a 2 year expac
[6:36:03] andaroo: MOP Classic is gonna be badass
[6:36:17] TheSteventh: @Kalderasch same
[6:36:18] Corvin_Tom: dragonflight is too furry-like to me

[6:36:33] Sunhammer756: wrath is my favorite
[6:36:35] Liquefiedmatter: Legion was unironically comfy, a nice one between WoD and BfA
[6:36:36] metalwrath22222: wotlk classic was the sweet spot, im so sad they are killing it
[6:36:39] Nephiux: Can you do battlegrounds in this mode?
[6:36:40] Aullama: Legion was great NODDERS Aside from the legendaries.
[6:36:41] draed00: pet's gone
[6:36:47] Somakutala: I actually like cataclysm.
[6:36:48] tag_me_if_chat_pepega_: danPanic
[6:37:03] EddyStylez: TBC was golden age for PvP wrath for PvE
[6:37:05] DrWraithjr: I loved the legendaries in Legion. They actually felt special
[6:37:12] Ke_0: Legion zones looked great
[6:37:17] RushingHook: Lich King is when I stopped playing :)
[6:37:19] balasparkle: replacing wotlk classic with cata is so dumb
[6:37:20] Kalderasch: MrDestructoid
[6:37:20] Cruduxy: InternetNoLife LUL is WoD classic going to be padded an extra year
[6:37:23] stephenkek: love the music in this zone
[6:37:28] Entropystachio: i'll take it to the council danStare
[6:37:30] Sarxend: I wish i didn't have to create a new account and pay a second sub to play on another server in WoW. If you want to go to NA/EU/ASIA you can't just change.
[6:37:33] Harmar: @A1chera agree, i lost count how many hours i lost in BC fighting over those flags LUL
[6:37:34] TheSteventh: i was waiting since wow classic came out for wotlk classic for the LFD aaaaaand they took it out
[6:37:42] mikl_: vanilla music is so good

[6:37:51] Somakutala: These elves went to the school of Siri
[6:37:52] Cruduxy: TheSteventh you can thank the complainers
[6:37:54] Zeel0t: PepeLaugh 0
[6:38:00] bembis2_: decent if they dont make too many servers
[6:38:01] Sehria_K: can we just pretend Cata didn't happen?
[6:38:02] buzzemfrog: The population will be cataclysmic
[6:38:04] tO_Ot: danClueless im so glad that Blizzard has always been known to do whats best for user experience and subscribers. Thats why there was never a huge drop of subs for WoW for years
[6:38:04] TheSteventh: @Cruduxy yeeeep
[6:38:06] 1arkantos1: @Sarxend fully agree
[6:38:19] tomoko_potato: More than 1
[6:38:24] Neronek88: i really thought it would end a wraith
[6:38:25] sgbyou: should have skipped cata and went straight to mop
[6:38:26] SekretAznMan: danHmm
[6:38:27] Malkyr: Cata is what made me quit for a few years, I wouldnt mind actually trying it this time
[6:38:28] andaroo: cata raids were pretty great tho
[6:38:30] gannnon22: wonder what changes they are gonna make
[6:38:31] nitechill: the survey they sent out to players overwhelmingly wanted Cata classic..so who knows
[6:38:32] parasocial_enjoyer: im not gonna play it. wotlk is where classic ends
[6:38:34] Zeel0t: they should not close wotlk if they open cata, but i guess theyre going to, major mistake
[6:38:39] Kalderasch: RIP breaker
[6:38:41] Cruduxy: SekretAznMan danNice how u doin? is it raiding time?
[6:38:42] AJBungah: @Sarxend i literally just resubbed only to discover that i need a different sub to play on NA ¬_¬
[6:38:42] tO_Ot: SekretAznMan its your fault danUpset
[6:38:43] Citruss_PUNCH: i actually liekd cata
[6:38:45] Zeel0t: wotlk should remain as it is
[6:38:47] TheSteventh: cata has a lot of good things
[6:38:48] SekretAznMan: Cruduxy raid this AMOGUS
[6:38:50] TheSteventh: i liked the quests
[6:38:56] SekretAznMan: tO_Ot FeelsGoodMan
[6:38:58] Sarxend: @AJBungah Pretty much the same. And i refuse to pay for a second sub.
[6:38:59] Cruduxy: SekretAznMan danCult Clap c'mere
[6:39:03] okumsup: im sure we'll be able to enjoy WOTLK again in 20 years when they have wow vintage
[6:39:08] glb13: Cataclysm was alright. It was MoP that I said no more
[6:39:09] Cruduxy: SekretAznMan danCult there better be bonus loot rolls

[6:40:15] metalwrath22222: to be fair, pandaren class feels and looks so childish
[6:40:16] Porkbutt1984: MOP was good
[6:40:17] fatalityphase: MoP is actually one of my favorite expansions
[6:40:19] mcburger8: pandaria was a furries dream Kreygasm
[6:40:21] ChromaticCorps3: @torse9 danWave danDuck danHug danLove
[6:40:21] TurtleExpress: I'm surprised there aren't several classic servers at different stages in the WoW life-cycle/expacs. Once Cataclysm launches you can't experience vanilla WoW aymore. So what was the point of classic if you didn't hop in right away? Why not have a classic server up to WotLK and a clasic server for Cataclysm?
[6:40:24] ElusiveOne_: @SekretAznMan danClown
[6:40:26] 1arkantos1: MoP was good imo
[6:40:34] jediknight223: I started losing interest after Wrath because my favorite character died.
[6:40:34] Harmar: i played some of it, MOP and legion sadly were ones i more or less missed

[6:41:35] EddyStylez: 1 server per xpac problem solved
[6:41:42] metalwrath22222: TheSteventh vanilla servers are that, static

[6:41:51] DonReiniero: @SekretAznMan danSus Horde
[6:42:04] TurtleExpress: That makes sense. But I think a pre-cataclysm and post-cataclysm server would fix a lot of problems.
[6:42:05] corvferr: thats a good idea
[6:42:07] SekretAznMan: DonReiniero alliance scum danMad
[6:42:15] ghsteo: thats how SoD will be

[6:42:24] Slipdreality: Careful, you're making sense there
[6:42:25] wessirius: For sure they have enough resources to support at least ONE server for different expansions. Just with static content for the sake of it
[6:42:32] Mescheen: @SekretAznMan HahaElf danKnife

[6:45:15] tO_Ot: Sadge
[6:45:43] valianya: They said in interviews that the technology they set up to allow Classic to exist allow them in the future to release any Classic type easily.  So I think long term they will periodically re-release Classic servers of various versions
[6:45:48] Wrenton: @to_ot I blame Activision for why Blizzard sucks and now that it had its way with Blizzard,  sold to Microsoft
[6:45:49] CheeszeCake: That was his way of subbing

[6:51:41] stephenkek: wonder if he was trying to tame a ghost saber
[6:51:48] valianya: The sale of ActiBlizzKing was a perfect storm situation.  There was a massive scandal with Blizzard and employees leaving and protesting.  On top of that Shadowlands was crashing and burning, causing mass player exodus to other mmos and other games.  Scandal was so bad they weren't even allowed as entries for game awards that year.  And then Microsoft offered the biggest price tag for a game company in history

[6:57:30] valianya: Shadowlands sold really well because of hype and Covid quarantine.  But one halfway through the expansion the scandal happened and stuff like Korthia happened.  The expansion was really bad with respecting player time, refused to change the locked grind systems fast enough from massive player feedback of how bad playing felt.  So players left in droves to FF14 and New World and Lost Ark
