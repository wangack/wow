[0:54:08] 91Niki: It's the same thing with hackers in fps games and such, people don't understand that some make a living making hacks for games. So ofc they are gonna keep evolving to avoid anti cheat systems, to keep make money. People think developers don't do anything to prevent it. People just don't understand that it's a never ending battle

[1:21:37] Sayryn: Doesn't even have to be midnight. the difference is only 7 or 8 hours so 10AM PST works.
[1:21:38] Clicklesly: With global release they also have to change the patch/reset infrastructure
[1:21:40] hammack52: i mean all this global release stuff has me asking the question of why was the staggered release done in the first place and why are they still doing it from a business stand point and what are they going to need to do to change that
[1:21:44] tofuwizard: Did they sword fight? Kappa
[1:22:01] smashwow: yeah idk if i'm liking the Mythic / heroic same week

[1:22:33] PieceOfPanic: I'm fine with The full release, problem is the entertainment value. The preps aren't "good content"

[1:23:33] Eviltuna13: just release the mythic raid at noon PST for both us and eu and watch people cry that its not a good time for eu players
[1:24:05] hammack52: can anyone answer me as to what there was a staggered release in the first place
[1:24:22] Naturalbeef: Why should Blizzard screw with everyone else's schedules for 100+ players?
[1:24:36] PieceOfPanic: More fair competition is good for the consumers
[1:24:49] aumixp: They give hardcore players own servers but cant give raiders global release…
[1:24:54] Aquadriel: why dont guilds figure it out and make it fair? is a community event after all
[1:24:56] smashwow: idk the next thing people would be bitching about is gear again, X team didn't get lucky with their ilvl or trinkets etc etc. that's when you just need to do tourny realms and be done with it
[1:25:02] TweektheProphet: I realy want to see an end of expac  torunment round with the top 5 guilds racing to beat all the raids,

[1:25:04] Broomba: one of the most annoying streamers live streamed a video of Nost on his stream advocating for everyone to stand up to blizzard and burn wow/blizzard down and promoted a nost version 2 on twitch yesterday, you know who i am referring to name starts with an A @towelliee

[1:25:43] Poriand: diablo 4 has kinda made me not care about this WoW patch. feels weird not playing WoW

[2:16:23] jkitchin75: did your pally die @Towelliee
[2:16:33] Molvonos: !died
[2:16:33] Moobot: @Molvonos https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1828967439
[2:16:44] Molvonos: I should just make that a sticky.
[2:16:49] PieceOfPanic: @Jango_ I think to be honest, it's mainly the Diablo 1 and 2 fans who are really Madge
[2:17:00] DunzoCD: @Molvonos wouldnt help they would still ask lol
[2:17:12] Molvonos: Still cuts down on the questions, if even a little

[2:18:35] Wulfgrym: diablo 4 is a juggernaut
[2:18:52] Masqerader: you're sitting on an advertisement
[2:18:56] Masqerader: its evetwhere
[2:19:04] zeiours: Wildstar should of taken advice Kappa
[2:19:08] PieceOfPanic: I think it's annoying blizzard started doing these "exclusive" things into their games. The originals didn't have that, it's pure fomo and money grab :(
[2:19:08] N3llee: 2 mill a day immortal.. keeping Bobby's yacht fueld up

[2:19:41] RocketvanPersie: diablo 4 cant be anything but good its too big not to be. they realized how badly they fucked up with the diablo 3 release and how it wasnt really good until the xpac and even not really until after that

[2:20:08] TheGiant99: It's a fun game to play....I just ignore the monitization
[2:20:11] RocketvanPersie: end game on inferno mode with most classes was too difficult
[2:20:14] N3llee: that kept millions from logging in
[2:20:16] PieceOfPanic: When I finished diablo 3, I was like.. Was that it?....
[2:20:18] Molvonos: People with their rose colored glasses bitching about gameplay.
[2:20:23] Jango_: d3 didnt get fixed until the reaper of souls expansion
[2:20:28] MysticRaven_: when wasd movements comes out ima be playing D4 a ton
[2:20:34] PieceOfPanic: ^
[2:20:35] R1CH4RD00M: Diablo 3 on release exept server error was so much better than the ez mode trash personal loot they gave us after tbh
[2:20:47] Shearkahn: Servers was terrible, the game was fine except for the end game.  if you chose a more difficult level and were melee, you were screwed.   and the legendaries were meaningless.   Yellows were better
[2:20:49] Masqerader: hell Battlefield 4 was an amazing game, and that shit had a horrendous launch
[2:20:54] PieceOfPanic: Even the updates they did to diablo 3, was never really "good"
[2:20:55] xxCameleon77xx: You base a review on the product itself? Crazy
[2:21:02] Jango_: the RMAH was sick
[2:21:07] Shrenko: guys how and where can I find a goblin? been flying all around Dragon isles looking for a portal on the map but nope nada , nothing....

[2:23:35] davysaurus: Died yesterday to a rare. Feels Bad man.
[2:23:44] 91Niki: @Gragnar A controller is your friend ;)
[2:23:44] Wulfgrym: force move is your friend
[2:23:44] TheRavenGrave: A first i thought Noxxic had classic builds but No they don't so sorry
[2:23:46] MysticRaven_: DI pc felt so good movement wise
[2:24:04] Masqerader: i have 2 buttons on my mouse and they're my oh shit buttons in WOW rest is keybinds + shift modifiers
[2:24:10] N3llee: yes
[2:24:16] 91Niki: D4 plays amazing with a controller. So if your hand / wrist can't handle a mouse too long, play with a controller
[2:24:18] MysticRaven_: yh
[2:24:19] PieceOfPanic: Yep
[2:24:37] Jango_: @91Niki this 100%

[2:24:55] khrownoes: are you playing this HC on NA or EU
[2:25:14] Shearkahn: @Shearkahn Not to mention the 30% reduction was a later patch.   Still barely helped
[2:25:15] 91Niki: @khrownoes NA
[2:25:35] PieceOfPanic: @DunzoCD U still have to do the additional mousemovements though, between aiming spells and move.
[2:25:42] PieceOfPanic: It's a lot of micro movements
[2:26:43] theDirtyon3: diablo with controller is BiS though
[2:26:50] tr4ncetv: dat aint right
[2:26:51] theDirtyon3: so chill
[2:27:02] 91Niki: yeah I feel the same way. but i am sure it is great for couch gaming
[2:27:17] TheGiant99: It's like actually made for controller now
[2:27:17] DunzoCD: @PieceOfPanic was just an alternate suggestion if you dont like clicking, its not optimal but its not too bad
[2:27:20] Jango_: its kind of like playing elden ring with a keyboard.  I dont know how people do it
[2:27:25] khrownoes: what server is the offical HC server
[2:27:29] BadCompanyJBB: Is the event 10am PDT?
[2:27:47] Jango_: @khrownoes bloodsail buccaneers
[2:27:57] PieceOfPanic: @DunzoCD No I get that, but for people who've got wrist problems it sadly won't be a solution.

[3:29:24] ArcaneSyntax: icc will have some hype i feel
[3:29:26] Panchee_: We do need classic+
[3:29:26] khrownoes: with that mindset retail is done
[3:29:43] ArcaneSyntax: i don't think classic+ happens in the way people want
[3:29:44] Fight_Monkey: hardcore needs wow tokens too

[3:32:00] ArcaneSyntax: it's 75k bots feeding 400 people doing gdkp runs
[3:32:13] geokouts: for me as a casual player DF is good
[3:32:46] xHukk: I started playing wow in 8.3 BFA.  And from then till now.  I think the game has improved 100%
[3:32:53] kostchie: There is a lot of whining and crying over the token to Wrath. I love it! I do not have to endlessly farm gold for riding and flying.
[3:32:55] TheZofren: I like dragonflight from a design perspective but man dragons just don't get my hyped lol
[3:33:00] KeidooTV: gdkp should be ban
[3:33:02] akia03: isnt it less profitable and populated than sl and bfa
[3:33:08] race_out: why didnt they just ban gdkp
[3:33:12] Celestia6: I’ve been really happy with DF
[3:33:32] hollowedlyfe: towLets towGo towHAMUP

[3:34:06] akia03: atleast the paypall dkp runs are less and less
[3:34:16] ArcaneSyntax: like using gold to buy carries aint against the tos, and if they did it'd kill the raiding scene so fast
[3:34:40] race_out: @ArcaneSyntax yeah, but trading BoP items wasn't in wrath originally

[3:35:45] race_out: the ability to trade BoP items for gold is a problem blizzard themselves caused lol
[3:35:53] akia03: would this tier be cheaper than raz?
[3:35:56] alsorrr: @ArcaneSyntax why do you think it's a problem? the people are present for the boss kill anyway - so they are eligible for the items
[3:36:05] geokouts: ahead of curve is 250k in my realm
[3:36:06] KeidooTV: well tons of people bought gold online to do those runs and people that had tons of gold sold it for real money thats one of the reason we have the token now so people could buy gold the official way therefore blizz gets a cut lol correct me if am worrg

[3:37:08] Skesdrin: A piece of their OWN cake...that they created, and it's wrong?
[3:37:19] Klavy: i think they can but it would require such a huge money investment that they are not willing to take
[3:37:25] KeidooTV: its a pitty tho but or well, wont stop me from playing wow tho
[3:37:38] Knocx: the subreddit is telling people to buy rmt gold to stick it to blizz
[3:37:42] MysticRaven_: yesterday was 11500 on EU gehennas now 9k
[3:37:48] Skesdrin: It's their game, so if they want a piece, let them have it
[3:37:51] Molvonos: @Knocx lol, how stupid.
[3:38:09] Molvonos: 'Stick it to blizzard' and then their accounts get either banned or compromised.
[3:38:13] AnimalCrackers_19: Could we get chat GPT to grind for us?
[3:38:13] Skesdrin: I am agreeing with you :)
[3:38:22] akia03: isnt it meh because its just game time not bnet balance?
[3:38:27] BadCompanyJBB: They can incentivize it within game to players though a bounty system

[3:39:26] KeidooTV: the value of the token yesterday went from 18 down to 9k now lol

[3:41:30] Knocx: on PS you can buy gear from the mods
[3:41:36] WhoIsAndrewJ: @WhoIsAndrewJ I don't think that - but that's the mentality, right? If I buy a token from WoW directly, I'm supporting mega rich org - where if I buy from a 3rd party - it might at least get some money to someone who may need it more.
