[1:05:32] grethedren: zoomer: The members of Victoria Vel Nex expect to clear Mythic content at a respectable pace. We have no toleration for people who are incapable of executing simple raid mechanics after a few attempts. We require everyone to have a thorough understanding of their class and the fight mechanics. We expect everyone to be on 15 minutes before the raid with the necessary raid consumables. If you are not on 15 minutes before we will begin looking for a replacement unless we were given prior notice.

[2:07:02] toogoo: @Graycen they take 5 dollars off your cheque everytime you piss in your closet
[2:07:02] scaff_24: lil gup doesnt know how charge backs work
[2:07:03] jay4871: REDDIT:  It just means that whatever revenue you receive moving forward will go towards that balance instead.
[2:07:03] Cumaraderie: gup tax
[2:07:04] jaliela01: Rocket: Graycen why did you abandon your child in Los Santos? He keeps calling stuart asking when youre gonna pick him up? He said something about you telling him to beat up homeless people for his allowance. Thats a new low for you man.
[2:07:05] oopsfish_: we discovered how to make him broke Thinkge
[2:07:06] grethedren: i'm seeing a lot of reddit posts about negative sub revenue but no one has an answer
[2:07:08] doofeeneed: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tG4Wsd1MNUM @Graycen this explains what happened
[2:07:10] R0bbieRobert: cause they are your subs ? u really dont get it
[2:07:12] miciahclay: It's just accounting, you had +115 the day before and then charge back, so -115 the next day
[2:07:12] BMJR06: could the chargeback be reflected on a later statement
[2:07:13] sergogg95: here is the explanation : https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2vlzeMbkM4
[2:07:13] Nitewinds: Twitch says the negative revenue is from subs that have been cancelled and refunded, so it's likely just going to be a week worth charged on one day.
[2:07:13] HappysFunPalace: knee cap tax LUL
[2:07:15] miciahclay: it nets to 0
[2:07:15] denimskirts: Fuck the refund
[2:07:17] avoidedneXt: maybe you should have thanked them harder

[2:58:32] emperor_of_kekkind: just saying buzzwords like he knows what he is saying
[2:58:36] Thedruidtyler: @MissGraveheart doyou have a surge protector?

[2:59:14] 5L4Y3R: just have to take all the parts out to replace mobo and put it all back in
[2:59:14] sepph_: You wouldnt give out shit you penny pincer
[2:59:17] paulthecat: MGH has donated like 2500 subs im sure she can fix her pc problems lol
[2:59:18] Shak_ka: when are you giving out Starforge PCs, graycen?

[2:59:27] busta07: straight plugm it iinmto outlet
[2:59:34] ari_sap: give MGH a starforge and give me some top
[2:59:36] Thedruidtyler: @Decoyduck its not that unlikely if the surge protector is old
[2:59:38] MissGraveheart: I replaced my surge protector very recently
[2:59:45] Rawhiders69: Aint no way MGH rawdogs her computer into the wall frogPls
[2:59:46] drontuffe: AwkwardFlushed
[2:59:47] 5L4Y3R: more likely the psu or mobo
[2:59:48] GrandmasCloset: GIFT HER A STARFORGE ReallyMad 󠀀
[2:59:48] llamasmurfz: i had a bad power cable once
[2:59:51] EasyPeasley: HUH
[2:59:52] oneALMONDMILKplease: SLORPGLORPIN
[2:59:52] Decoyduck: @Thedruidtyler its possible but very unlikely
[2:59:53] Thedruidtyler: @MissGraveheart does the PC turn on at all
[2:59:54] Spikeqc: AYOO
[2:59:55] Ashkenazii: there are so many things that it could be, you should rule out a software issue before buying new hardware
[2:59:58] 5L4Y3R: oh shit could be the cable
[2:59:58] kebbin: Your mom still is, thats for sure
[2:59:59] GoodGuyEli74: peepoShy
[3:00:08] MissGraveheart: @Thedruidtyler it does, but when I game it fucks itself
[3:00:14] 5L4Y3R: @MissGraveheart, do you have another power supply cable? to try
[3:00:16] jay4871: did she try put it in rice
[3:00:23] Shak_ka: i guarantee it's not a software issue
[3:00:24] Thedruidtyler: @MissGraveheart hmm that sounds more like a GPU issue or PSU
[3:00:24] 5L4Y3R: from the surge protector to the ps
[3:00:28] emperor_of_kekkind: if its when you play a game it is possibly a overheating problem
[3:00:37] MissGraveheart: @Thedruidtyler yeah I am thinking its the GPU
[3:00:40] HappysFunPalace: i doubt wow is causing overheating
[3:00:48] Oatmealyeti_: i agree
[3:00:49] Ashkenazii: you are crazy
[3:00:51] 2dallineed: Power supply is usually a common culprit if exclude temp
[3:00:54] turdsoup: wtf lUL
[3:00:56] 5L4Y3R: overheating of the psu maybe
[3:00:57] 2dallineed: Temps too
[3:00:58] menethas1: sounds like a temp
[3:00:59] BaddestCloud: define “fucks itself” what are you seeing?
[3:00:59] LazerDefender: no
[3:01:04] Ashkenazii: you can see what is failing in the windows event logs
[3:01:05] nfernal_majesty: @MissGraveheart that sucks hope you figure it out :(
[3:01:05] Shak_ka: something overheating?
[3:01:05] busta07: try taking out ram sticks and putting back in
[3:01:06] LoRoadSimRacing: What are the temps looking like? If the temps are fine and it cuts out when power draw increases, probably a psu issue
[3:01:07] HappysFunPalace: can you play wow with onboard gfx?
[3:01:07] LazerDefender: what exactly does it do
[3:01:07] Rawhiders69: if its GPU just unplug it and connect it to the mother board instead @MissGraveheart
[3:01:07] tjzlock: prob temp or gpu
[3:01:14] verklatschtw: cpu cooler
[3:01:14] BaddestCloud: does the game run poorly? does it shut off? does it freeze?
[3:01:15] Spikeqc: stop asking if u crazy the answer will always be yes YEP
[3:01:17] Thedruidtyler: @MissGraveheart try this google "display driver uninstaller" and do a fresh install through that program
[3:01:17] MissGraveheart: gonna look at the event viewer
[3:01:24] Spikeqc: Sureee
[3:01:25] rohdey: JOHNNY: GARY!! GARY GARY GARY!! STOP BREAKING P C'S ALREADY! WHERE IS OUR STARFORGE DICK HAMMER GIVE AWAYS?

[4:06:38] Crusadin_Cajun: You're BMR is probably around 1600. So if you add an activity factor and an extra percentage based on how many kcal you wanna add, you should probably shoot for 2500-3000kcal/day. Again depending on how intense your exercise is.

[5:38:53] Silvergorillia: You can definitely make chicken piccata without cream! If you do so, increase the chicken broth to 3/4 cup. You could even do a half chicken broth/half white wine mix. I don’t recommend subbing the cream for something like milk or half-and-half for a couple of reasons. The acidity of the lemon will likely curdle the sauce, and the sauce won’t thicken as well. Either omit it completely or use heavy cream.

[7:25:05] Gosu_Rival: what’s icky to you, spiders or cockroaches?
[7:25:06] bigbobs37: Crocodiles are generally considered more aggressive than alligators. Crocodiles tend to be more aggressive towards humans and other animals, especially if they feel threatened or cornered. Alligators, on the other hand, are usually more docile and are less likely to attack unless provoked. However, it's important to remember that both crocodiles and alligators are wild animals and should be treated with caution and respect.
