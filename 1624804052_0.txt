[1:24:37] keeindordel: @Towelliee  ive had beta since the 1st wave, but i havent palyed beta alot tbh... too busy in WOTLK classic but is there anything worth doing is most of the stuff fixed yet?
[1:24:39] Thoreya: Surprised
[1:24:40] ArcaneSyntax: I lost my shit when I saw a bellular video where he spent 5 minutes complaining about the timers for the boats to DF zones LUL

[1:24:47] Nokterian: KEKW
[1:24:49] nickyjams1: @ShadyXVXX yeah I forgot it comes out next month. thats crazy
[1:24:49] ofbuzzzzz: Hey @Towelliee do you think races matter in terms of dps?
[1:25:11] LSBreed: paid healers
[1:25:48] swigiggity: just buy the elite pvp gear
[1:25:51] swigiggity: from the vendor
[1:26:08] swigiggity: if they have good stats for you
[1:26:08] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[1:26:09] 3663Sharad: Thats stupid
[1:26:21] nickyjams1: oh yeah. professions matter the first patch, then after it doesn't matter at all
[1:26:22] KingSpud91: Yeah but if the tank gets it then healers will bitch about never getting it.
[1:26:24] Voidred: it increases healing by 15% as well
[1:26:44] ShadoodHD: 1 shot? monkaS
[1:26:52] 3663Sharad: Combined with a boss mechanic and the forced movement... great
[1:26:59] llaundryy: it doesn't one shot by you get a massive dot that will kill you over 8s stun
[1:27:07] ArcaneSyntax: it's not a one shot if the stun kills you over 8 seconds chat
[1:27:15] swigiggity: bronze
[1:27:39] swigiggity: green gives a "take increased healing"
[1:28:20] swigiggity: yeah black gives crit
[1:28:21] danksly: LOLW
[1:28:25] ArcaneSyntax: the affix feels too much curse for the kiss it gives
[1:28:26] common_taco: i'm sorry what
[1:29:01] brozzy: It’s a super easy affix for a 15% damage increase
[1:29:12] Ultraxxion76: Is dragonflight prepatvh out?
[1:29:19] llaundryy: it's an annoying piece of shit
[1:29:28] swigiggity: its def a weird affix to get used to while doing other mechanics
[1:29:34] llaundryy: it persists through death, you can immune it and troll people
[1:29:37] swigiggity: people easily forget atm
[1:29:54] nickyjams1: pallys had that in Shadowlands.
[1:30:03] nickyjams1: dps was crazy with prot
[1:30:08] danksly: night elf heal to shadowmeld just before the buffs go out? BBYodaS
[1:30:10] ShadoodHD: sometimes pain can be the greatest teacher 4Head
[1:30:29] strike879: well thats also a way to solve the tank shortage tanks not getting the curse mechanic
[1:31:03] monstayou7: how does the new thundering work now?
[1:31:09] nickyjams1: 10 key looks really easy
[1:31:23] 3663Sharad: I mean its good-ish, if tanks won't receive the debuff. Bossmechanics are desinged to be tanked not to walked around
[1:31:44] headshot_hunter6: have you looked into torchlight infinate, the new mobile ARPG that IMO blows diablo immortal to dust
[1:32:19] RRspud: To defeat the HANS

[1:33:56] abracka_: there will be a weakaura for it day 1 lol
[1:33:59] 3663Sharad: Weak Auras will clear this once again
[1:34:00] strike879: or maybe its intended cant really as tank go on a road trip to search the oposite orb to prevent the stun
[1:34:03] Barret: i just imagine the dungeon you use dragonriding in and that going out
[1:34:55] nickyjams1: whats the meta tank for M+
[1:35:23] ConqKale: does the affix go  onto 2 or 4 people?
[1:35:27] swigiggity: lol its beta, there is no meta tank
[1:35:41] abracka_: tinkerer is the meta tank
[1:35:44] nickyjams1: there can bee

[1:39:15] Artiiz: what talents are you running with on prot pala?
[1:39:57] PlagueHit: This reminded me skyreach final boss
[1:39:58] swigiggity: during fight you have to throw motes into the goal
[1:40:13] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee Maybe on purpose to let tanks play the boss mechanis right
[1:40:22] 5ixer: The affix is healer biased, that's legit not me complaining
[1:40:22] Castelor: they could put a 5% to tanks with no stun and let them always alone
[1:40:40] brozzy: You’re scaled to 392 now YEP

[1:52:11] Artiiz: Sentinel is better than avenging wrath talent?
[1:52:20] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee Maybe tanks wont get the affix jsut to do boss mechanics right. If the bug isnt the reason for this
[1:52:21] pereadin: @Odinslayer can't be anywhere as bad as brew
[1:52:22] GreenAirline: more deff artiiz

[1:56:44] Fleymour: @brend92 the one you like
[1:56:55] Artiiz: so they fixed 1 out of 2 talents :D
[1:57:07] Animemron: Ah atm its leaning towards BM but if we get a WW/MW i can decide between the tanks. I have to solid preference yet, i just want to be reliable as OT.
[1:57:11] bloodogg35: best bet is when u get it u tinker around see what works for u

[2:26:34] Elff11: leggo's dont work outside of SL as currently on beta
[2:26:35] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[2:26:38] keeindordel: THE legendaries will work because they added legendaries for evoker for pre-patch
[2:26:42] Benevelle: legendarys work I think but just only in shadowlands content
[2:26:42] ArcaneSyntax: legendaries only work in SL zones
[2:27:05] Benevelle: ye
[2:27:09] arttemm123: what about in raids in fated nathria for example
[2:27:10] keeindordel: yes
[2:27:18] arttemm123: will it double stack ?
[2:27:18] keeindordel: fated wont exist
[2:27:29] keeindordel: fated is gone once season is over
[2:27:29] mavericks312: the real question that no one is asking is do we get full BFA legacy damage
[2:27:31] zysmos: KEKW
[2:27:33] keeindordel: and it will never be back
[2:27:34] arttemm123: fated wont exist in pre patch ?
[2:27:43] Benevelle: no fated still active in prepatch
[2:27:43] keeindordel: no it wont
[2:27:48] TacDuc: Oh, I had hoped they fixed the UI with the update that hit somewhere in the last 9 hours
[2:28:02] mavericks312: oh so you can still do the fated quests then?
[2:28:04] Spaztastico: when is pre-patch?
[2:28:05] Benevelle: the wowhead article says you can still get slime cat in prepatch

[2:29:56] strike879: towelliee has no apreciation for art
[2:31:03] Norbi33: i feel like they overcomplicated how proffesions work..
[2:31:14] cyberratt: alchemists learned how to make magical ramen salt packets
[2:31:25] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it's at the first guy
[2:31:55] Benevelle: @Norbi33 it's on purpose, they want people who play profs as their end game to be able to do that and make big $$$
[2:32:38] demiralos: What bugs me the most about BS in Beta, is that I can't for the life of me find the source for the Draconium Great Axe. Its unlearned, but no source. Not via training or recipe. Will be a great way to get a fancy weapon as soon as you hit 70.

[2:37:50] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Not sure if its a bug or intended, i have all the dragon riding glyphs on one server, made another toon on the other server and have them all
[2:38:18] Demanisraar: Yeah its soo good
[2:38:25] Demanisraar: Love that
[2:38:39] Demanisraar: That's my first prio once I get a dragon on the isles
[2:38:46] TacDuc: Though it is so interesting getting the points on another character, instead of having the skills you've upgraded
[2:38:48] Snackada: pkmnHey pkmnBongo
[2:38:51] Youredoneson666: i didn't know it went across servers also. thats dope
[2:39:01] warrenny: Does it affect the evoker version?
[2:39:22] Demanisraar: I have been practising lol.. got the route sorted
[2:39:30] Featherbow: @Youredoneson666 it's ACCOUNT wide, so yes servers don't matter
[2:39:39] TheCliffyShow: That one on top of that mountain in Waking Shores. I saw that one and was like, "Nope!"
[2:39:46] Youredoneson666: I got them all within 30 minutes with the very basic riding. gotta work on that riding
[2:39:59] Demanisraar: Highest peak is the last one to get.. you get up there easy

[3:14:59] Rumhammer: its lame
[3:15:04] Benevelle: they said tanks get it much less
[3:15:17] bloodogg35: they wanted to kill healer so u fail
[3:16:01] KrimsonElite: morning squad
[3:16:05] Benevelle: "The healer or tank will randomly be chosen to get the final debuff, weighted towards the healer."
[3:16:21] strike879: imo it would be better if instead a stun its a root less likely on a wipe but still punishing
[3:16:32] Respls: so is the affix better now?

[3:27:05] Broomba: i thought this was a wow chat and channel why are people talking about crap and opinions that dont matter
[3:27:11] AndreMSAL: Hello! Do you know if blizz will allow cross faction party to join Random Dungeon Finder in Dragonflight? I know that now when an opposing faction player first hits a mob it does not turn into gray anymore, so that helps on questing on neutral places.
[3:27:33] nickyjams1: your right @Broomba

[3:29:04] KrimsonElite: @KrimsonElite excellent thank you
[3:29:08] Justintegra31: just be glad that mobs don't respawn in dungeons\
[3:29:30] KrimsonElite: thinking im gonna shy away from elvui and go for a more classic look this time around
[3:29:35] KrimsonElite: really get me in the WoW feels
[3:29:49] Nokterian: yeah gonna try the new UI as well
[3:29:57] Nokterian: and use the addons i always use
[3:30:19] tumb_tack: soak balls.. noted
[3:30:23] KrimsonElite: honestly what towelliee has setup here for his ui is pretty much what i'll go with

[3:32:55] KrimsonElite: @KrimsonElite completely agree
[3:32:56] nocturnal_2195: b
[3:33:29] Molvonos: They keep running away from each other, lol
[3:33:31] NVbrutal: feel like the buff should last 30seconds but happen less often would be better imo
[3:33:36] brozzy: Did they nerf the hell out of Hunter?
[3:33:37] Respls: soo if you set your role as a tank in the group would that reduce the chance to get it?
[3:33:47] Korupcija_: ye, hope for version 3 to be more polished
[3:33:54] Korupcija_: by version 10 it might be good
[3:34:00] Grock: @Towelliee is the buff good?
[3:34:21] futomara01: whats the mists m+ of df?
[3:34:26] Molvonos: "I wouldn't go forward yet" Rogue doing rogue things
[3:34:29] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: think it should just reduce your damage by 15% if you fail? @Towelliee
[3:34:35] Rhyos: how're you finding the new professions rework ?
[3:35:53] Cyrothia: other than the affix, how are the new dungeons feeling in mythic+??

[3:36:20] Rocman: it needs to just be 2 peps at a time and make it an even chance for everyone
[3:36:30] stabzmcgeee: i like that the tank gets it least,, if a heal/dps gets stunned for 8sec the fight is still on,, if the tank gets stunned for 8 sec thats nearlly always going to be a wipe
[3:36:39] Herzenliegen: lol
[3:36:47] Nokterian: towLets towGo
[3:36:51] Nokterian: Deadge
[3:37:00] Addetetet: this new thundering is just bad, boring effect, and if someone has died and you get linked its just rip if mechanics happen
[3:37:05] Dankatar: Im sure once the WA get made that has a timer for the affix it'll be very easy to handle in pugs.
[3:37:27] Addetetet: and sooo much shit on the ground on every pack and boss xD
[3:37:51] Baaltaza: @Addetetet yeah, my thoughts too KEKW
[3:37:53] Nokterian: peepoRun
[3:38:09] TyndiVelspaz: that burst damage though. whoa!
[3:38:11] stabzmcgeee: 100% there will be a WA that asigns peeps and says when to clear etc
[3:38:17] nortom2: hey towel hows prot pally feel

[3:39:49] Addetetet: @Addetetet like melee unfriendly I´m used to, this is just a whole other level

[3:41:36] tumb_tack: :o this is gonna be rough
[3:41:50] Damingo54: Tuaren god
[3:41:54] IchabodCrain: @Towelliee are you keeping this UI, when DF launches, or are you going to revert to your normal elvui UI?
[3:42:12] Ertra: yeah they need an isAlive check
[3:42:17] Addetetet: yes, proximity as well. Because we had a person die and release. He and me got it. I died because i was stunned in every mechanic

[4:51:03] imurweaknesslive: Chat serious question from a classic andy that has never played retail: is there another class other than shaman that has blood lust? because i dont see a shammy and i heard a lust call. srry for noob question xd
[4:51:29] The_U1timatum: there is an item called rums
[4:51:31] The_U1timatum: drums*

[4:57:58] Nebulizer87: i would prefer no testing
[4:58:05] Aidler: this could be interesting
[4:58:11] Nebulizer87: but they don't have a good enough internal team to do so
[4:58:16] Lenietwitch: @xExilicx no idea yet :P
[4:59:30] Aidler: fire always looks impressive
[4:59:37] Soxzors1: yea soft enrage
[4:59:45] Drazel_Thezil: I guess the boss gets stacks of everything in the middle
[5:00:44] Lenietwitch: @Nebulizer87 even so, raids and ungeons are so complicated in terms of tunning, you need data, and there is no company that can afford something like that ammount of testers, unless you want raids like ff14 or lost ark where every fight is basically a full single target with no tunning needed (or a very basic one)

[5:48:17] Hyrja: love that every boss has a different element. raid looks cool so far
[5:48:42] MysticalOS: or just install DBM, pre spread when mark cd is near, ground it, then hug back up if you want to. as long as you can watch the dang timer :D
[5:49:21] Dagomarus: A evoker could pick you up and take you to pillar to get “grounded” for the lightning effect

[5:50:01] MysticalOS: yeah it fully supports normal heroicc and mythic for 7/8 bosses tested on all of those modes. put like 14 hour day in yesterday to make sure it was all done
[5:50:42] MysticalOS: it's only missing some p3 timers on kurog because some stuff I need isn't in combat log

[5:51:59] Dagomarus: Some people had blue circles and were just standin in raid not clearing feelsbad
[5:51:59] Z3azza: one of the dhs are really fuken this up
[5:52:02] MysticalOS: based on logs i saw for all testing, council was the boss most struggeld to understand for some reason.
[5:52:12] Z3azza: he had the debuff for a long time and kept spreading it
[5:52:43] Z3azza: he kept standing lol he didnt even try to clear it
[5:52:59] TheGiant99: worried about being on the dps meter LOL

[5:53:27] Z3azza: @TheGiant99  hahaha you  right
[5:54:43] Rudric_Ice: we don't :)
[5:54:52] Z3azza: i wish i have beta so i could join
[5:55:00] J3ST3Rt: Isnt there a dugeon guide like most raids and dungeons
[5:55:04] TheGiant99: people gotta just stop hitting boss and drop the stuff
[5:55:18] MILESkg21: doing mechanics is a dps loss KEKW
[5:55:30] TheGiant99: If they made normal so you can just que into anytiume you want
[5:56:11] NoWaayMan: boomies would crush this fight
[5:56:30] Dagomarus: In fairness the melee keep signing up lol
[5:56:31] Rudric_Ice: which dps is topping meters chat ?
[5:56:32] J3ST3Rt: how much do you think this stuff will change when the actualll game come out?>
[5:56:51] Donwasz: @Towelliee can i tank it?
[5:57:00] Rudric_Ice: time to main lock again
[5:57:21] userrx: is normal raid gear better then Raid finder
[5:57:38] Soproatlol: does holy paladin still do dmg in df?
[5:57:55] xXSiebzehnXx: @userrx yes
[5:57:57] Dcarter: was gettin a muffin
[5:57:58] MysticalOS: 19 body type 1
[5:58:28] userrx: i miss 10 man raid :D
[5:59:52] TJdps: 20 man is so good
[5:59:55] userrx: its chill and fun i wish they got it back
[6:00:09] lithium364: time for 1 man raiding , just call the difficulty "Kungen"
[6:00:10] Honvar: I wish archeology was relevant again. :)
[6:00:11] lithium364: Kappa
[6:00:32] TheGiant99: Every game doesnt have to be smash your head aghainst the wall difficult
[6:00:48] Retsiem: yes
[6:00:50] Dinermoe: plater does work yes
[6:00:53] MysticalOS: cataclysm basically proved 10 man heroic/mythic is a bit broken....the power of individual power of each player too high. so literally going to 1 heal or something increases dps too much. and any fight with spread mechanics much easier on 10 man vs 20/25 etc etc
[6:01:00] krozym: @Towelliee  if blizz would apply the flex sistem to M raid would be interesting
[6:01:03] Dinermoe: probably not KEKW
[6:01:06] mrniceguy817: Yes you can import
[6:01:12] mrniceguy817: I imported mine just fine
[6:01:13] Retsiem: my profile worked from SL, most likely

[6:01:19] doogs44: Do you think going blacksmithing would be a waste outside of tmog?  it seems like my toon would always already have better gear than I could craft.
[6:01:22] naxriaa: But they do the tuning for flex which is more annoying

[6:01:55] Tamz_tv: best change we could get for mythic right now is the lockout being per boss

[6:03:42] Bloodrave120: dang classic servers went down
[6:03:46] MysticalOS: meteor axe is a soak mechanic yes
[6:03:55] MysticalOS: it's literally called meteor :D
[6:04:13] cmdrwedge: i just got 7 adds the second you went into raid... wtf bro
[6:04:20] Lazermage23: Just dont lock us to one raid id and that would alleviate alot of issues and open up raiding to alot more people.
[6:04:50] iamWaritself: @cmdrwedge You can fix that by using your prime sub or your moms or dads or uncles cousins nephews girlfriends prime.

[6:05:09] PrimeTyme83: Is anyone else getting the Amazon Music ad on replay even when you are subbed?
[6:05:14] Uputz: Raid lock shouldnt be a thing
[6:05:23] doogs44: I think he means dont lock us into a mythic lockout, let the lock out for mythic work like heroic
[6:05:39] Lazermage23: All the other raid difficulties you can come and go as a Pug into them, but Mythic locks us to one ID and we cant join anyother group
[6:05:41] Uputz: For Mythic its stupid cause you cant get loot anyways
[6:05:47] MysticalOS: i think they are saying mythic should be like other dififculties, a loot lock only but you can still keep doing it or something..which would be pretty cool.
[6:05:57] MysticalOS: but the problem is how broken it is for splits
[6:06:03] Joemercyy: hi
[6:06:11] Dcarter: yeah that id do
[6:06:20] Dcarter: like ff14 being able to do fights over and over
[6:06:21] Uputz: you mean like heroic?
[6:06:25] Dcarter: just be loot locked
[6:06:27] Tamz_tv: I want to be able to sub players in and out of  mythic fights without having them locked to the instance
[6:06:51] Uputz: Its dumb since you can get mythic gear from creations
[6:06:53] Tamz_tv: yeah ofcourse loot would be locked like heroic per boss
[6:07:17] Tamz_tv: it's nuts that we haven't heard anything about arclight rumble yet
[6:07:35] 1solz: 1solz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[6:07:35] Uputz: Or tier gear from creation now its just an old idea
[6:07:55] Tamz_tv: Catalys opening on week 5-6 is so cringe

[6:09:40] besk: yet top 3 dps are 3 melees. huh
[6:09:50] Dcarter: bc i died lol
[6:09:51] TheCliffyShow: Now, would be a good time for me to finally make that druid healer I've been meaning to.
[6:10:09] Dcarter: and doesnt seem like it towelliee i stood in one to see and they dont

[6:10:50] Javiz: KEKW
[6:10:53] MysticalOS: that's mythic only
[6:11:29] MysticalOS: if you consume fire you run out and it creates scarcity and forces you to clear blizzard had higher stacks like 7-8
[6:11:32] Herzenliegen: Is this reg?
[6:11:36] Bloodrave120: do classic servers usually take a dump on the weekends?
[6:11:40] mavericks312: this fight in lfr is gona be a nightmare
[6:12:00] WhoIsAndrewJ: what does .2 minute equal?
[6:12:02] besk: its normal to rogues to double the dps of the 2nd best? lmao
[6:12:12] WhoIsAndrewJ: 15 seconds? 10 seconds?
[6:12:27] Donwasz: @Towelliee any spots ?
[6:12:35] WhoIsAndrewJ: 12 seconds
[6:13:39] xXSiebzehnXx: If they’re on pulling that much on cleave fight as fury they don’t know what they’re doing tbh
