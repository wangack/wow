[3:02:10] pereadin: @Critcobain I know, but there are players out there that will and can.  I've had dps die in a key and maintain over 18k.  Its just all about the dps this tier.
[3:02:14] CritcobainTV: two of our wipes i died after popping full cds so im usless after that, and when we have to do small pulls because of inspiring im bad too :(
[3:02:19] Louisdballa: @deadcells the reveal of what it will be?

[3:13:55] 91Niki: fyi, some people accidentally list m+ via the mythic 0 channel. So you might have some keys pop up if you remove the "(mythic keystone)" in the search
[3:14:16] HaggardxGaming: Why is there such a small player base for Alliance on a lot of the servers?

[3:33:39] Tokies: they were USA 2nd one tier though. Also world 4th though. that's pretty good
[3:34:01] AureliusXV: nah
[3:34:02] mavericks312: tbh alot of these guilds are just a farm system for liquid and echo
[3:34:12] c0mmander_starscream: The satisfaction probaly goes to ZERO when they look at their RL banks accounts after being online 80 hrs a week
[3:34:18] DallTV_: mothod shot them self in the feets
[3:34:21] AureliusXV: those streams have way more views then they usually have
[3:34:22] rsimpson105: METH OMEGALUL D
[3:34:31] pereadin: 1 viewer stream Pog KEKW
[3:35:03] mavericks312: how many players has liquid plucked from instant dollars and FSY this xpac alone lol
[3:35:12] 91Niki: @pereadin Hey! I will let you know, that 1 bot in my stream is my best friend OKAY FeelsBadMan KEKW
[3:35:12] Tokies: exposure I think he's talking about. If you were dealing with a 10 viewer count streamer you might see some growth and it's hard to get out of 1 to 75 viewers into higher numbers.
[3:35:22] SmallzzIV: I'd be interested to see where the chinese guilds were without the reset difference
[3:36:39] Tokies: I kinda agree with that consistency matters. In online content you are cheers and you gotta be open for the drunks or they go somewhere else.
[3:37:09] Alaquane: can someone translate the stream title for me? I  just cannot process it
[3:37:29] theDirtyon3: Im just glad that drill ad doesnt do that frontal cone anymore like in mechagon
[3:38:19] 91Niki: @Alaquane M+ farm for trinket. Trinket drop = fiestapotato character reinstated. Raid to world first day 17, is it over yet

[4:02:32] pereadin: @pereadin It was super demoralizing.  then the other 2 trinkets i needed took a total of 70 runs combined
[4:03:03] 91Niki: @pereadin I've had itches to play again, but hearing that is just a complete turn off lol

[4:04:52] pereadin: And just seeing anime power for 7-10 runs at a time
[4:05:25] KragnosWoW: then u gotta get it again next m+ season KEKW
[4:05:28] 91Niki: @pereadin I just really hope 10.0 brings back the feeling of purpose to play that we used to have. As a game that's subscription based, you'd think they'd wanna put in mechanics that is grindy and rewarding at the same time
[4:05:30] Alaquane: beast master hunter and survival are pretty easy
[4:05:45] 91Niki: to keep people playing
[4:05:51] pereadin: @pereadin I can't agree more!
[4:06:22] pereadin: @KragnosWoW The moment I get one of these 3 trinkets in my vault, I think I'll probably cry given the time commitment I made to farm them.
