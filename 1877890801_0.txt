[2:28:42] FatCheeseMan: It is hilarious to see that even all these years later, people still say game is dead daily.
[2:28:45] Will_Faro: I agree. I just try to get back into m+ 390 ilvl and it takes years to get a heal
[2:28:54] ridder30: makes me wanna log in to my rsham and do keys.. wait... makes me want to log into my vdh and do keys.. wait... makes me want to log in to fury war and do keys... wait
[2:28:58] aero22: Guess it‚Äôs that time of the season to watch a bunch of teams play the same tank, same healer, and same 3 dps
[2:28:59] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: Not enough 5'5 players in basketball, dead game gg balancing

[2:29:07] tekdubya: Same issues that killed Shadowlands are back to kill Dragonflight.  Blizzard ignoring blatant issues and not listening to the community.......
[2:29:08] srwaan: I hate avalanche jesus christ
[2:29:10] wilybob: are they running double healer? :S
[2:29:10] rinma1: is this the most boring meta?
[2:29:21] Flameninja007: A triumphant roar echoes from atop the Seat of the Aspects as Nasz'uro, the Unbound Legacy is formed.
[2:29:24] Scopel: @ridder30 the best part is how they gave so much love for evoker augmentation, he was so bad before, it's the first time we see him getting competitve play
[2:29:24] MogrimSTALKER: @FatCheeseMan in creavity yes it is

[2:29:39] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @wilybob no, they're aug evokers
[2:29:43] Azerkingg: @rinma1 far from it
[2:29:44] 64brandon: @tekdubya go ahead and name a couple of these "issues." I'll be waiting :)
[2:29:46] vippeepo: YEP double meta
[2:29:51] TimOsnatch: @wilybob yes
[2:29:55] Sylwevrin: Which team has the best mog tho?
[2:30:04] RhoSigmaPhi: Who cares about wow esports, when blizzard doesn't care enough to put in a hotfix before the biggest event?
[2:30:07] Tanner_Metro: chat, why does every team have an Evoker dps that is doing bad dps?
[2:30:09] SmootTM: where i can see all groups? cant find any links sadly
[2:30:12] kimohunt: @Sylwevrin dont think you have too much choice on tournament realm XD
[2:30:17] Kareshkah: Blizzard has listened to the community more than ever before, chasing nostalgia ends up being most people‚Äôs actual issue with the game.

[2:30:30] Verruzan: People say thats how the top end and 0,1% title works, you have to adjust to the meta, but you were always able to get the title since its been introduced, without rerolling classes, played the entierty of BFA and Shadowlands without BL and always without a range dps. You could always make it work for title at least
[2:30:33] Null901: @Tanner_Metro They are too good so they put restraints on themselves
[2:30:33] SmootTM: @ModeraYsera thanks
[2:30:33] yangzhou_fried_rice: it's like an LoL game without ban/pick, great job done

[2:30:52] Punkapin: man i love the varie ResidentSleeper
[2:30:54] Will_Faro: waiting for m+ ResidentSleeper
[2:30:57] Headachem: The same comp for every team in every dungeon truly kills this competition, it was fun to see strats adjusted with different comps
[2:31:00] Sleepypan: thought u hated this yet ur still here watching @yangzhou_fried_rice LUL
[2:31:00] ridder30: @64brandon the balance is clearly one sidded. compare this to 10.0 mdi,, only 3 months ago, which saw almost every spec in the game represented
[2:31:09] moderatygos: @brothadawkness too long, moobot got it
[2:31:13] Tanner_Metro: ahh i see so aug evoker increases team dam which is why they're part of the team
[2:31:13] ModeraYsera: @brothadawkness moobot got you for message length
[2:31:18] FUNwithDRUGS: Augment evoker was a mistake
[2:31:24] brothadawkness: What the hell
[2:31:28] kimohunt: shorten your message Kappa. Moobot think you talk too much XD
[2:31:29] Daffen00: they should ban the meta classes from the finals to see how high they can push
[2:31:30] Sleepypan: @FUNwithDRUGS agree
[2:31:31] 64brandon: @ridder30 all you did was list things that are completely irrelevant to 99.9% of the playerbase. try again
[2:31:32] Sammit64: @Headachem definitely agree with this
[2:31:47] PaulxD: why is evoker so low LUL Û†ÄÄ
[2:31:52] yangzhou_fried_rice: @Sleepypan 9 min of muted time is not a short time
[2:31:52] Verruzan: this is not like its "always been" cause you could always get title with an offmeta comp. done it many times, this is the first time its not gonna be possible
[2:31:55] FatCheeseMan: Great push always has low class variety. This may have even less than usual but it is hardly catastrophic. It does need fixed of course.
[2:31:56] Hengeko: @Tanner_Metro yep
[2:32:08] Sleepypan: @Daffen00 u realise there wud just be the 5 next best classes so it wud still be teams running same comps with not a variety
[2:32:08] Doohzyy: what a mickey mouse season this was
[2:32:12] aendenicus: stop being cranky chat
[2:32:12] theslorp: The same comp by every team is a totally fine and normal occurrence in a competitive tournament where their goal is to win
[2:32:17] buseereal: @PaulxD they need a buff, really trash rn
[2:32:24] kimohunt: tbh this patch with new evoker spec is hard to balance the class. next big patch (10.2) should be much better.
[2:32:24] ravageritualx: I AM SO CRANKY
[2:32:26] Sleepypan: @theslorp right
[2:32:27] Sintry123: @Meeix RAGEY
[2:32:31] napilnek: Hello everyone, I'm new, tell me there are only 5 classes in this game?
[2:32:33] ridder30: @64brandon this clearly effects more than .1% of the player base.  go try and play the game on a bm hunter right now and see how much fun you are having sitting in q
[2:32:37] Esotraz: he has disperse
[2:32:39] Sleepypan: StillWaiting hunter rework
[2:32:39] kimohunt: <lmso
[2:32:43] tekdubya: So cranky that most of chat can't play their favorite character, just due to balance ineptitude.
[2:32:51] I_eat_fried_chicken: @theslorp also speaks for incredibly poor balancing
[2:32:52] Scopel: thanks blizz for the nostalgia, i loved when in overwatch season 1 pro play they had 2 or more tracers and they all had the same team
[2:32:55] FUNwithDRUGS: Please buff ret paladin emoneyClown
[2:33:00] Nativo1: @theslorp Yes i aggre, but it way better to watch differnt comps but way better than 3 Hunters like BFA S4
[2:33:01] FatCheeseMan: You can 100% get the title with an off meta comp, the balance is not that extreme. There will be a balance patch next week for sure.
[2:33:04] Verruzan: not complaining but its just wrong to compare this meta to past metas. you could get title with almost any spec in every season before
[2:33:04] Iolebuendia: If u dont play a healer, stop saying its a healer problem
[2:33:07] slaynd: lol what healers
[2:33:10] Sleepypan: @ridder30 i love getting declined 17s constantly just trying to get weeklies done on my 446 hunter ive timed all 20-21s on KEKW
[2:33:10] 64brandon: @ridder30 i play warrior, rogue, and monk and have no issues getting instant invites to 20s. I dont see any of those three classes present here
[2:33:27] ridder30: @FatCheeseMan you clearly havent tried to get title with an off meta spec

[2:34:31] tiiimps: Players that abuse overtuned classes are not gaining score fairly (where applicable). Level the playing field. 20/22/25/29. You're not challenging yourself by playing broken classes in higher keys. In need of a more robust representation of other classes.
[2:34:31] Sleepypan: @Grandzerox then everyone goes "MAKE UR OWN GROUP" so u do but no healers and tanks queue up KEKW
[2:34:40] Scopel: @Kareshkah that's true, but this is the first time everybody is using the same comp, shadowlands had different comps all the times, different classes for different dungeons
[2:34:47] Brave1974: Still on same boring comps this isnt fun to watch
[2:34:47] 720pheadache: Blizzard: Balance is fine :)
[2:34:54] Sebleh: A meta como by itself is not bad design tho
[2:34:54] Verruzan: @FatCheeseMan got 3400 score with offmeta comp, which was over 200 points above the cutoff. now its only 60 points above the cutoff just a week later

[2:35:27] FatCheeseMan: @FatCheeseMan The cut off is always gonna grow as the season progresses.
[2:35:32] TheHashbrown87: @meowmeowmeow2467 i play the game and call it the wrong thing all the time lol
[2:35:34] itsrazno: @Kareshkah It's virtually impossible to perfectly balance the game. There will be combinations that have an overall edge over the rest. The trick is to make that edge as small as possible so while optimal isn't the only way.

[2:45:00] BrylicET: @tekdubya It's an addon called trolling

[3:01:33] nobodypicksbulbasaur: @stormyhorny Their new spec buffs allies instead of doing direct damage, and the damage addon can't directly attribute it to them
[3:01:42] Sleepypan: new spec and details doesnt count it properly u can see it in logs tho @stormyhorny
[3:01:44] Fostethesnowman: Wish there were different comps than just one.
[3:02:04] Sleepypan: @LadGoldfish derp its early im not reading
[3:02:12] babadookz1251: get rid of augments plz
[3:02:13] tiyanigean: @stormyhorny they recently got a bard-esque spec. details cant show the dmg they buff onto their allies. logs though can. (but neither is really precise)
[3:02:14] frostyhornyx: Thanks all!
[3:02:42] Lorrdzik: @stormyhorny @BrylicET cant make it work without Blizzard. New spec do buff other characters stats, you cant calculate how much dps their should have because of that buff and that is only part of the problem
[3:02:42] oODarkTinTOo: I personally LOVE how we only have 5 specs left in the game and deleted alll the melee DPS. We've saved valuable memory to allow for the Evoker Damage Details update. Keep it up!
[3:02:43] Sleepypan: ü•± @devo768
[3:02:43] Trackamp: The diversity in groups is wild
[3:02:48] spalff: i just dont understand why they gave augmentation so much utility while offering similar damage to a dps just makes 0 sense
[3:03:03] senhorelefanto: i am not familiar with this underrot tech the teams are using!
[3:03:09] Sintry123: Are these runs being logged anywhere so we can get an accurate picture of the Evoker damage?
[3:03:25] inanoyushi: prob blizzard dont play the game maybe?
[3:03:34] mazllli: imagine these dev evokers doing less dps than tanks in +25 keys Kappa

[3:03:50] Loctrine: Chat really gotta chill. This is WoWs FIRST SUPPORT SPEC. SO EXPECT ISSUES! The class is meant to make its peers way stronger. Half this chat doesnt even push 24-25+ so why do you care what the meta is lol.

[3:04:38] Loctrine: Having support spec adds more options to the game for new specs this is a great thing.

[3:05:19] klong01: i really dont see why they have added 1 old dungeon. completely pointless
[3:05:26] Loctrine: @gamerdragonwow thats just not totally true

[3:05:40] alec2991: lol retail wow
[3:05:48] Mutsein: @Loctrine melee might be viable, but they are not invited to any keys above 16 ^^
[3:05:49] Loctrine: Pugs still run mainly whatever they want only the people that feel the need to minmax run that meta still at this low level
[3:05:53] dewlei: Phial of Icy Preservation BIS for FH 1st boss.
[3:05:57] Silrainer: @Loctrine not a good answer, I should be able to pug, its bad design
[3:05:58] Sleepypan: @Mutsein definite lie
[3:06:01] spalff: its fine to have support specs in keys with some utility that offers similar damage to another dps, allows them to focus on being a 'support' the issue is they have 3x as much utility as other dps
[3:06:01] sulozor: @xyronic TOO SOON
[3:06:06] GamerDragonWoW: @Loctrine and there are way to many of them still
[3:06:12] Loctrine: If you come to the stream to cry about a new spec and a for once SOLID META. WITH A DEFINED COMP. Then leave.

[3:06:47] dewlei: @Loctrine Don't wanna be a negative nancy but please explain how is this meta solid ?
[3:06:48] Loctrine: Just learn the better class then if you wanna push the top end.
[3:06:54] Sleepypan: idm what spec/class i run 20s with, i like having a melee kick in the group most of the time tho
[3:06:54] Fostethesnowman: @Mutsein idk I do 22's on DH
[3:07:20] Mutsein: @Fostethesnowman and i do 24-25s on a warrior, but it takes me litteral 5 hours to get into 1 key
[3:07:22] matteian: imagine unironically pushing keys in s2‚Ä¶ rly balanced comps!
[3:07:26] Loctrine: I mean its a defined 5 class comp instead of constantly swapping. The meta will continue to change non stop. Either get good enough at your class to push high or switch.
[3:07:43] spalff: plenty of melee classes are strong but theres never really been classes as broken as these specs are in terms of m+
[3:07:43] Loctrine: People that complain are just not good enough at the game to swap or not.
[3:08:02] Nebtaspal: Augmentation removes another variable slot to group comps. The meta will always trickle down to pugs that's just the way it is
[3:08:05] Loctrine: You could take almost any melee to a 26 no problem or ele sham or warlock or hunter
[3:08:13] Brave1974: @Loctrine LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:08:14] Fostethesnowman: @Mutsein Yeah that's super unfortunate. There are too many specs/classes in the game for a five man. People shouldn't be so judgmental about metas.
[3:08:15] Loctrine: You know you have options but decide to complain instead
[3:08:21] Mutsein: yes, but they are not invited :)
[3:08:24] SeargentFish: @splaffiez u seen destro lock in slands s3 or s4?
[3:08:25] Silrainer: the top 8000 keys timed are almost all the same comp, thats just terrible design when thats the case
[3:08:28] caio_btc: the tears are so good i might start doing pve on my evoker
[3:08:30] Sleepypan: hunters the only class to have no-one 3400 io + :)
[3:08:33] Loctrine: So make a group
[3:08:33] Zartharion: @Loctrine Hunter in a 26? KEKW.
[3:08:46] Loctrine: @zartharion yeah
[3:08:57] spalff: @SeargentFish destro didnt have the insane utility and group survivability these specs have that allow them to push such high key levels
[3:08:58] Loctrine: Surv hunter was pushing 25-26 look at banshers

[3:09:00] CritcakeEU: we're gonna see dps warrior at some point tonight, right?

[3:17:47] asso4: all this diversity in team composition is boring me
[3:17:48] Miichalek_: @meadooru just look at one screen?
[3:17:52] MrRox1337: StillWaiting hi jak
[3:17:54] Sleepypan: @daasdingo ive seen 1440?
[3:18:05] Meeix: @Meeix nah, just keep them short and friendly and itll be fine
[3:18:08] AutomaticJak: hey fren @MrRox1337 StillWaiting
[3:18:19] Cervantas: @Miichalek_ yeah look at one screen when it's split in 4, totally a better solution then focusing on one team and rotation around 4Head

[3:18:54] Kolobok666: need 20 rio for 0,1%, but im frost dk, nerf broken comp, ty
[3:18:57] ModeraYsera: @Sebleh Twitch has been buggy lately
[3:18:57] CritcakeEU: @daasdingo you can stream on 1440p on twitch, but the bitrate stays at ~7500 which is just not enough. 1440p streams with that bitrate will look very blocky, especially when there's a lot of stuff moving on screen
[3:19:02] realcousineddie: @BrylicET this is the best version..bring the player, not the class.. Shows true skill.  never been a better Push.  need to be creative and better than everyone else. TY Blizz

[3:20:24] Sebleh: Chat post some pastas I lost what I had copied seblehNotes

[3:20:41] mazllli: @Miichalek_ thank you
[3:20:48] Sleepypan: Players that abuse overtuned classes are not gaining score fairly (where applicable). Level the playing field. 20/22/25/29. You're not challenging yourself by playing broken classes in higher keys. In need of a more robust representation of other classes. @Sebleh
[3:20:56] realcousineddie: @Rogastik Yep, love it
[3:20:57] Jormera: #NerfAugmentation
[3:21:03] a_basic_mitch: @tekdubya Then don‚Äôt watch? Lol
[3:21:07] Crazus10: @Swampage Augmentation evokers buff the other classes.
[3:21:10] ridder30: @chmee not entirely true, it ws super strong on final boss of nokud offensive last season
[3:21:26] Virtual_Hero1701: are they running the same classes on purpose?
[3:21:33] Hunzug: Wait this isn't Fortnite?
[3:21:44] Treypanning: @Sleepypan the game is about abusing overtuned or imbalanced classes
[3:21:46] Nebtaspal: Mods NotLikeThis
[3:21:51] a_basic_mitch: @virtual_hero1701 Yes, this is the best comp currently
[3:21:52] 0xDUAL: @Virtual_Hero1701 It's the meta, so purpose but not really.
[3:21:52] kimohunt: @Virtual_Hero1701 cause these classes are the meta for m+ right now XD
[3:21:53] Sebleh: @sleepypan meeixBless thank you!
[3:21:53] kiddo_xdd: @Virtual_Hero1701 yes, it is in the rules that they have to run the same classes otherwise its unfair and they can be banned
[3:21:59] tekdubya: @Virtual_Hero1701 I think its a display bug, Blizzard would never intentionally make the game this unbalanced
[3:21:59] Sleepypan: @Virtual_Hero1701 yes? why ruin their chances playing a less optimal group
[3:22:02] Ayel_z: mikkaaDead mikkaaDead mikkaaDead mikkaaDead mikkaaDead
[3:22:04] Miichalek_: @mazllli Weakaura is just called M+ timer on wago
[3:22:04] Crazus10: @Virtual_Hero1701 this comp is very synergistic. Its quite a bit above others. only 1 team changed a priest for a sham.
[3:22:05] Sebleh: Players that abuse overtuned classes are not gaining score fairly (where applicable). Level the playing field. 20/22/25/29. You‚Äôre not challenging yourself by playing broken classes in higher keys. In need of a more robust representation of other classes.
[3:22:10] BrylicET: @Virtual_Hero1701 No, they all got to randomly select classes based on dice rolls
[3:22:11] Sleepypan: I wonder if blizzard forced everyone to run augmentation evoker on TGP to promote the new spec? Imagine handicapping yourself willingly and drag around a lizard that can't even outdps a healer! @Sebleh
[3:22:12] chmee: @ridder30 I would call it more of a situational benefit than a defensive ability
[3:22:15] Virtual_Hero1701: cool, ty

[3:22:54] Swampage: enjoying the game guys
[3:22:56] 64brandon: "guise o mi gawsh why r ppl using the BEST classes to push the highest level of content the game offurz!!??"
[3:22:58] kidkriss: wtf. every comp is the same
[3:23:03] Miichalek_: @wp991 not all XD

[3:23:12] Sleepypan: @kidkriss wtf every twitch comment is the same
[3:23:12] a_basic_mitch: @thoticusses Because Aug buffs the rest of the group

[4:16:48] Sebleh: Players that abuse overtuned classes are not gaining score fairly (where applicable). Level the playing field. 20/22/25/29. You‚Äôre not challenging yourself by playing broken classes in higher keys. In need of a more robust representation of other classes.

[4:58:40] Vx_Odessa_xV: Remove all the buffs and support classes bring, like paladins‚Äô blessings, cause they want a class brought for the class and player, not buffs it brings‚Ä¶.. ..then they make Augmentation spec and embody it entirely with a class

[4:59:01] Breadmanfun: 4 screen split is hard to see
[4:59:06] Ge_Nova: people who discovering TGP its has been same since the 2nd TGP, every team pick the most efficient because if one team pick somthing else there's 90% chance they wont succed :)

[5:18:18] Unknown_Devil99: nosebleed what?
[5:18:20] st_cynical_one: meeix, did you get the servers fixed?
[5:18:26] HOFF9001: @B3vvan yes, it's rerun from s1
[5:18:29] x_Scy: Muqtwow but if you fail the 2 chest on 28, it's a wasted key

[5:19:20] Sonikbob: @Sonikbob @Mr_Underpants I know, I would say ban Firemage/Spriest tho, just to see how aug interacts with other classes in high keys.  @CalmVoiceGaming I am aware, Just a discussion that came up during a few alt keys today

[5:19:41] AlexGLOne: I think if gamers are gamers they can be challenged. Pick classes and spec and make them play...all have to each play a rotation...to see how awesome we are.

[5:39:39] Norcosh: Why are they playing evoker? Low damage low healing
[5:39:40] frriiedd: @Brotrain it woulda been way more interesting with all the class diversity before 10.1.5.... actual meaningful decisions and using your comp to optimize is just better
[5:39:47] toker11132: @Sonikbob But WHY
[5:40:01] SindrinX2: I would love to see a LoL style picks and bans system for classes

[5:40:04] Sonikbob: Because someone at blizzard said so
[5:40:06] Togec1: People need to realize TGP comp diversity is ALWAYS low. You look at past TGPs and its the same thing
