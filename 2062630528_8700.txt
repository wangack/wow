[6:04:35] eyxx: we could easily do 4/9
[6:04:36] niko_is_bad: surely we can do 7
[6:04:38] niko_is_bad: unironically
[6:04:41] SeriousJester: @MightyTeapot Plenyx p2, surely this time

[6:05:53] Byrchi: We've done nymue like that already
[6:06:04] ViviLouF: I miss weekly aberrus for mythic chromatic essence with muisted xddTree
[6:06:08] niko_is_bad: yeh
[6:06:16] Byrchi: Aight get niko in to heal and emecci to dps
[6:06:27] Edeslash: Yeah aberrus alt raids had a bunch of ppl from muisted but also from byrchi's guild Forbidden which was my previous guild. There should be people interested in properly organized alt mythics in both for sure
[6:06:38] ViviLouF: Aight get niko in to dps and emecci to heal
[6:06:40] Edeslash: Good idea to use discord for organization
[6:06:44] Byrchi: keys stream Corpa
[6:07:02] ViviLouF: i could use full clear on my druid xdTree

[6:11:13] spruudel: @niko_is_bad you have no idea
[6:11:16] spruudel: ive been ramping
[6:11:21] dranet11: sod herb picking > full clear hc raid
[6:11:23] s7venwolves: PepeLaugh
[6:12:04] Edeslash: too many moonkin and fire mage alts have told me "ive been ramping", i cant trust them any more
[6:12:04] s7venwolves: 9/9 heroic tho
[6:12:07] s7venwolves: he can't be horrible
[6:12:13] Edeslash: Only byrchi actually but anyway
[6:12:20] niko_is_bad: its always boomie and firemages
[6:12:29] RandTheDragonRebornn: Hello Teapot, I want to return to Gw2 again but I disliked SOTO a lot, do you think I could be engaged on in again next update ??
[6:12:35] s7venwolves: he could've bought it too, true LUL
[6:12:41] dolordolo: I bought the clear, but I am good bro xddTree
[6:12:47] Byrchi: I never say I'm ramping

[6:17:10] tomdotdll: feed the platemen Gladge
[6:17:18] dranet11: not having the legendary at this point is honestly sad AND pathetic
[6:17:22] dolordolo: I AM GONNA DOO IT IMGONNABAT
[6:17:32] dranet11: total noobstink
[6:17:38] eyxx: isildur is warlock
[6:17:42] Edeslash: I did 2 x hc fc this morning and both groups had so many melee and so few ranged that Tindral dispels were targeting melee even without any deaths
[6:18:02] eyxx: @Edeslash xddTree unhinged simulator
[6:18:22] Edeslash: And the ret paladins.... They do not handle a situation like that you know..
[6:18:31] niko_is_bad: ret paladins...
[6:18:38] tomdotdll: HOLY ww
[6:18:41] eyxx: the ret stands for something NAILS
[6:18:48] Edeslash: NAILS
[6:18:54] niko_is_bad: the ret is intentional
[6:19:09] Byrchi: Get my rat druid in so I can yoink the tier from igira WICKEDTHUMBSUP
[6:19:10] s7venwolves: I don't have it cos I don't play GIGACHAD
[6:19:19] s7venwolves: (I main rogue) xddcomfy
[6:19:22] dranet11: amirdrassil or gnomeregan??
[6:19:25] tomdotdll: you would've loved the legion raids
[6:19:45] eyxx: i like everything except igira and how the architecture looks
[6:19:48] Malganica: Malganica subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[6:19:52] dranet11: i cant wait for p3 raid after playing gnomeregan
[6:20:03] Byrchi: Gnomeregalul
[6:20:08] dranet11: massive improvement over bfd
[6:20:20] s7venwolves: kinda sad a lot of people didn't come back for P2
[6:20:31] eyxx: idk why the emerald dream isn't more naturelike and has these giant monolithic buildings
[6:20:52] dranet11: p3 is meant to be in april
[6:21:10] SeriousJester: fresh gachi monday
[6:21:14] aFlyingGuru: amirdrassil bosses are very good but i feel like the environment is pretty lackluster
[6:21:41] niko_is_bad: (kazzak)
[6:22:02] eyxx: aberrus layout and environment was really cool but just had too many trash
[6:22:08] SeriousJester: hunter
[6:22:08] eyxx: too much*
[6:22:11] Edeslash: Byrchi why wont you admit that you are Japboom in queue
[6:22:20] Splurtlol: me and dranet are from kazzak...
[6:22:25] jeik_jkmc: K*zzak
[6:22:30] itsky_syrup: Kazzak is for dogs

[6:23:09] eyxx: every realm is inferior compared to stormreaver and ventureco tbh
[6:23:14] dranet11: better than having no hunter ICANT
[6:23:26] SeriousJester: next sod raid we have 10 people
[6:23:32] s7venwolves: xddcomfy
[6:23:49] tomdotdll: anvil HOLY
[6:24:01] eyxx: s2 trinkets Gladge
[6:24:06] eyxx: i miss them
[6:24:34] dranet11: darens (sod) does more dps than vivilouf druid
[6:24:41] Edeslash: i love how melee hated anvil stacks in m+ so they just gave them a new anvil, the signet brand
[6:24:49] tomdotdll: cant see dps meter CAUGHT
[6:25:00] dolordolo: CAUGHT
[6:25:01] Splurtlol: tired of these trinkets you have to be in combat for
[6:25:03] Splurtlol: shit trinkets
[6:25:04] emecci: vault had better trinkets
[6:25:21] Splurtlol: grieftorch omega
[6:25:31] emecci: storm eaters boon gaps any other trinket
[6:25:47] dranet11: @emecci NAHHH
[6:25:59] Edeslash: i would have loved class trinkets but the very rare status is a bad thing. trinkets end up being very rare even when they are not labeled as such (like the chromatic essence)
[6:26:18] eyxx: i actually really like the idea of class trinkets
[6:26:25] Splurtlol: @emecci emecci floorpov trinket
[6:26:29] eyxx: they just shouldn't be omega turbo bis for every situation
[6:26:37] TheSHAYdynasty: world first!!!!
[6:26:42] ViviLouF: a mage not lusting is usually extreme and immediate noobstink
[6:26:55] dolordolo: DogLookingSussyAndCute
[6:27:18] Max0704: @eyxx to be fair the class trinkets from what's his face boss wasn't too bad
[6:27:25] Edeslash: i suspect that dawn of the infinite will be in the next m+ season as well
[6:27:26] Max0704: It was good for a few classes
[6:27:35] Byrchi: @Edeslash shut the fuck up
[6:27:43] Splurtlol: kick all of the lusters
[6:27:44] Edeslash: all DF dungeons feels like the only logical option for S4
[6:27:48] cronic: shut the fuck up
[6:28:06] eyxx: @Max0704 yeah they weren't too bad, dominance was a bit rough for warlock since it was giga BiS for 2/3 specs (and arguably the third as well in M+)
[6:28:06] spruudel: susCat byrchi
[6:28:09] Edeslash: SNAILS oh no not Japboom-Stormreaver SNAILS

[6:30:23] jeik_jkmc: yeah, i enjoyed it as well
[6:30:33] tomdotdll: yeah thats always the peak of wow
[6:30:54] tomdotdll: first day of expansion, patch day, new season etc
[6:30:55] SeriousJester: I just couldn't sync up with the other frogs. I was ahead and they did other stuff, im not gonna wait and not play
[6:31:06] cronic: surely you'll find 19 players as degenerate as you
[6:31:09] cronic: to do that
[6:31:17] Edeslash: @cronic in Muisted
[6:31:31] Edeslash: the 9 hour raid saturday first week of every season :)
[6:31:33] SeriousJester: im honestly looking forward to being done with this tier
[6:31:37] tomdotdll: im gonna level my second windwalker tomorrow for alt runs :)

[6:32:22] SeriousJester: I mean I can never take time off randomly
[6:32:27] SeriousJester: and I don't want to raid weekends
[6:32:41] Edeslash: DRAINED time to level my sixth Evoker Lizard
[6:32:43] SeriousJester: so it's best to get out now so you can get a new frog for the meme season
[6:33:00] SeriousJester: I'll play til you find one so you won't be gaped
[6:33:09] Byrchi: No looking at damage meters
[6:33:10] setiusART: chat, does someone have the "NA is just so fucking free" pasta?
[6:33:27] setiusART: yoo o/
[6:33:29] tomdotdll: As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after this game I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free.
[6:33:31] setiusART: its a GREAT pasta

[6:35:23] SeriousJester: plenyx will log vanilla and grind 1k gold
[6:35:35] zooloxthephoenix: plenyx is never free from htcm, he keeps coming back
[6:35:37] TrayvonKing: Aware
[6:35:38] SeriousJester: he'll stop once im out, i'll force him to play other games
[6:35:50] neuronutz: plenGaSpin
[6:35:55] jeik_jkmc: "grind"
[6:36:15] SeriousJester: I had all of the things
[6:36:19] SeriousJester: except some restistance pots
[6:36:24] eyxx: Plunge ⁉️
[6:36:24] tomdotdll: Plunge ?
[6:36:24] jeik_jkmc: we'll see
[6:36:26] SeriousJester: I dropped like 80g on engi + cons
[6:36:28] Edeslash: HOLY Plunge
[6:36:29] jeik_jkmc: if i break
[6:36:36] ViviLouF: HOLY Plunge proc
[6:36:47] jeik_jkmc: i am 150 tailoring right now
[6:36:54] jeik_jkmc: getting there
[6:37:18] SeriousJester: I didn't max it out, I went til dynamite
[6:38:26] jeik_jkmc: crafting is breaking me
[6:38:40] eyxx: they need to remove the mage lust talent meme
[6:38:43] eyxx: it's fucking cringe
[6:39:08] Splurtlol: they should have less bosses
[6:39:12] cronic: thats a gw2 opinion
[6:39:29] Edeslash: Japboom-Stormreaver's guild actually had a bit of a problem when their enhancement shaman decided to take a 2 week vacation at the start of Fyrakk prog (he was banned for gold buying in classic) (allegedly) (he denies the accusations)
[6:40:10] eyxx: mythic would be like 10 guilds
[6:40:18] pickled_choya: zased and unhinged
[6:40:25] Edeslash: fyrakk and tindral were the 2 fun bosses this tier :) but yeah 99% of guilds would break within milliseconds
[6:40:43] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[6:41:18] eyxx: i think first 4 being free is fine (even if i'd prefer them being somewhat harder) but nymue and larodar are such a waste of good boss design
[6:41:34] SeriousJester: aight, ima go exercise for real now. hit me up tomorrow if you want to do a fungeon
[6:41:48] cronic: blizz should make a fated raid only with endbosses
[6:41:57] cronic: imagine a raid with 8 endbosses
[6:42:00] eyxx: gnarlroot is good but igira and volcoross are kind of just loot pinatas
[6:42:23] niko_is_bad: Council is only fun if youre the duck
[6:42:25] Mazmerized: Council is super beans as dps unless you're a moon moon
[6:42:26] niko_is_bad: otherwise its dog tier
[6:42:59] eyxx: igira feels like it's missing a mechanic
[6:43:15] Edeslash: Fun fact: Plunge used to be named Bigmayo but I got tired of everyone getting the two warrior alts mixed up
[6:43:26] cronic: B I G M A Y O
[6:43:29] jeik_jkmc: bro 100 gold is 38euros! fuck that
[6:43:45] Spinerek: lunatic take
[6:43:51] niko_is_bad: Nobody likes stopping dps
[6:43:54] niko_is_bad: But thats fair
[6:43:58] Mazmerized: I agree with you, i just think current council is a poor version of it imo
[6:44:05] Byrchi: Council isn't even about holding dps
[6:44:07] eyxx: council is fun on warlock because you can ranged cleave
[6:44:22] Splurtlol: shadowlands dps stops were literally where you go afk
[6:44:32] Splurtlol: because if you push boss too early you have shit cd timings
[6:44:33] Edeslash: Holding DPS is lame because it always feels like AFKing. I don't mind holding if my brain is occupied by mechanics for example
[6:44:59] eyxx: yeah downtime from mechanics is fine but holding dps is fucking horrid
[6:45:16] Splurtlol: afk for 20 seconds on kel'thuzad, 20 seconds on sylvanas for boomkin cd's, complete dogshit
[6:46:43] MightyTeaBot: Subscribe to the stream to become an epic gamer! PogChamp bit.ly/tpotSub
[6:46:49] Edeslash: but i gotta say pooling DPS / holding dps abilities, procs and resources for a priority target is extremely Zased gameplay that we haven't had a lot of examples of recently
[6:47:28] eyxx: idk it's probably fun for the raid lead but as just a player it's awful
[6:47:36] eyxx: literally just wasting time
[6:47:39] Edeslash: @splurtlol bro SoD makes me sad, i want ravenous frenzy back so bad. But yeah KT was the worst boss of all time
[6:48:25] aFlyingGuru: having to hold dps sometimes is good design
[6:48:48] Vestina: You must seed
[6:48:54] Splurtlol: holding dps to blast an add or to pump in next phase depends half the time on what class you're playing anyway, think it's what differentiates certain classes.
[6:48:57] Edeslash: Fyrakk has a bit of that going on, you can reach a level of p2 add dps where you start holding procs etc for boss damage once he lands
[6:49:00] NotYetRatedd: spriest is BROKEN CatChest
[6:49:17] Vestina: That was almost a cascade
[6:49:20] itsky_syrup: Susge
[6:49:36] jeik_jkmc: i was the spore
[6:49:38] eyxx: sporecloak is worthless on anything and everything
[6:49:39] neuronutz: how soon should I get into a crafting profession? I'm a level 31 currently
[6:50:00] Plenyx: 67.5 PogChamp
[6:50:18] Vestina: That's a lot of trees
[6:50:19] neuronutz: I'm getting better with the combat, but I definitely want to change some keybinds
[6:50:24] eyxx: buff a purely defensive embellishment to be BiS dps as well -> nerf it into uselessness because it was OP after the buffs xddTree
[6:50:27] jeik_jkmc: @neuronutz crafting professions in retail are attached to the expansion so you should just wait to get to dragonflight and start there
[6:50:47] Splurtlol: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1QV6ow2NLQ
[6:50:50] Plenyx: best pull for fyrakk
[6:50:57] Plenyx: you have it on screen
[6:51:08] niko_is_bad: Sporecloak on everyone on fyrakk prog would unironically be optimal
[6:51:09] Edeslash: but once you are level 60 you can even get a decent chunk of exp from Dragonflight crafting professions btw!
[6:51:10] niko_is_bad: thoughts
[6:51:26] Splurtlol: surely you seen that vid i linked teapot
[6:51:26] aFlyingGuru: it's hard for me to relate, i have infinite focus
[6:52:21] Edeslash: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/stormreaver/japboom There's no way this is accurate right? He's not using the void tendril heirloom trinket??
[6:52:39] eyxx: i think part of today's memes was also just mechanical rigidity or whatever you want to call it

[6:53:13] Vestina: I always play scared in a sense during progression.
[6:53:15] Mazmerized: wow culture is all about guild rank at a certain level and not parsing. no one cares about pull count either is all about fastest execution
[6:53:53] Edeslash: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuyDbgzj-iM this is the Dratnos video about the topic
[6:53:57] Edeslash: it's very zased
[6:54:03] Edeslash: i love this kind of general raiding philosophy
[6:54:21] eyxx: the secret rage phials etc pisses me off tbh
[6:54:27] eyxx: same shit as sporecloak last tier
[6:54:34] Hundred123: they only care about transmog
[6:54:41] aFlyingGuru: i think its a bit different with guild wars, because the content is so easy that dps is the only thing you have to care about
[6:54:43] Norn91: if u get too many pis the parse is invalidated :P
[6:54:47] aFlyingGuru: its not the same with mythic raid/high m+
[6:55:22] jeik_jkmc: yeah the sporecloack was gigaMeme last tier
[6:55:45] aFlyingGuru: yeah there's a difference between just caring about dps and being obsessed with dps, agree
[6:56:05] Edeslash: bro i just checked Snowcrows and power quickness herald is at the bottom of the benchmarks, I will NEVER play that spec
[6:56:06] tomdotdll: i spored CAUGHT
[6:56:12] eyxx: and people were secretly swapping off of it until we were on echo
[6:56:17] eyxx: aka for multiple prog bosses
[6:56:20] itsky_syrup: i was going to flame the fuck out of all the cringe fucks that didnt sporecloak last tier
[6:56:25] aFlyingGuru: @eyxx ICANT

[6:56:34] Norn91: thats some insane health difference lol

[6:57:04] aFlyingGuru: people need to get real
[6:57:08] Edeslash: shame that the dps meter is covered, i would love to see Japboom-Stormreaver on top (the insane moonkin fight)

[6:59:12] itsky_syrup: @Splurtlol i fully support this theory
[6:59:14] Norn91: if you're progging a boss you have no business caring about the parse, thats just how i feel, if the boss is on farm then yeah i can understand
[6:59:35] Edeslash: @splurtlol ty for that comment i have officially lost my mind
[6:59:41] criselbart: Every CE raid ever in the history of eoe
[6:59:48] criselbart: Wow
[6:59:55] aFlyingGuru: @Edeslash wait is that not what the name is about
[7:00:00] niko_is_bad: dps players are all fucking cringe
[7:00:02] itsky_syrup: so basically the guild is full of shitters
[7:00:07] eyxx: i think i was kind of thrown off today by the lack of a ranged player as well
[7:00:12] moash_: There's not much of a dps check in fyrakk, just gotta focus on living
[7:02:01] Edeslash: yeah the lack of ranged is actually very annoying on that fight. You just dont have enough baiters for p1, and that will lead to more random deaths especially in melee. And as ranged you have to run way more for baits so your positioning is bad for firestorms etc
[7:02:14] eyxx: yup
[7:02:41] eyxx: i think i just need to accept that i can't really do much during p1
[7:02:46] eyxx: besides running around
[7:03:53] eyxx: yeah it's just really unfun but gotta do what you gotta do ig
[7:04:11] cronic: My pc crashed xddtree

[7:05:22] Byrchi: EZ
[7:05:33] moash_: Fyrakk is probably the hardest fight I've had to heal
[7:05:36] eyxx: tindral was fun aside from the lag, smolderon was fucking awesome
[7:05:42] ViviLouF: @cronic how does your PC crash every 10 mins
[7:05:48] Byrchi: Coz its dog
[7:05:52] cronic: it doesnt, its random
[7:05:53] ViviLouF: xddTree
[7:05:55] niko_is_bad: one of the pug monks rolled into the boss too early and killed like 7 ppl
[7:06:03] cronic: sometimes it happens 3 times a day, soemtimes i go 3 days without crashing
[7:06:04] NotYetRatedd: 3rd with 2ilvl xddTree
[7:06:17] Edeslash: Fyrakk p1 prog was insanely fun for me because it was literally just me coming up with my personal Hover plan to optimize casting while moving while always making my way to a spot where slower ranged dps can't be baiting
[7:06:34] itsky_syrup: kick em and inv my paladin
[7:06:35] Edeslash: On a warlock i would be draubed as well
[7:06:37] itsky_syrup: xddTree
[7:06:46] Vestina: Is there a possible leech?
[7:06:50] pickled_choya: maximum leech mode engaged
[7:07:13] Edeslash: @cronic what if your pc crashed 4 times during a single tindral prog raid NAILS
[7:07:32] eyxx: i smoldered
[7:07:33] cronic: @Edeslash and 0 times during whole fyrakk prog

[7:09:26] eyxx: HOLY battlepets
[7:09:35] aFlyingGuru: what the fuck is a battle pet
[7:09:46] cronic: @aFlyingGuru cash money
[7:09:51] Edeslash: yeah great idea inviting an agent into the guild BOGGED
[7:09:59] eyxx: idk if i can acknowledge cronic's existence anymore because anyone who engages with battlepets in any way is clinically insane
[7:10:02] ViviLouF: I will moonfire the boss from 40yd vivilo1BondageTree
[7:10:11] Edeslash: @aFlyingGuru basically a Palworld clone inside wow
[7:10:14] cronic: @eyxx i only make money with them, nothing else
[7:10:30] spruudel: Japboom-Stormreaver will disintegrate

[7:10:43] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[7:10:49] Edeslash: if Japboom survives the entire fight i'm sending him 50k gold
[7:10:57] Edeslash: (it's a fortune for him)
[7:11:07] Hundred123: you play pet battles if merely killing critters in open worlds is not enough, they must kill each other
[7:12:02] kepsuda: Cronic.....
