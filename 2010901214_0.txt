[1:44:33] kickassassins: does rogue have no AOE for tanking?
[1:44:41] Pups_Gersky: Tanking is the rep grind.

[1:45:24] cyrex172: yeah u have to add stuff to complete box
[1:45:25] maventar: You can
[1:45:29] cyrex172: then go to sw and turn it in
[1:45:31] maventar: U don't have too
[1:45:31] KroniclyLazy: still gives rep empty too
[1:45:31] strongstout: they just don't get as much xp
[1:45:33] nalyx: just like you said
[1:45:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: you can turn in empty box for some rep if you fill them you get more rep
[1:45:39] strongstout: rep rather
[1:45:46] Rune_Phoenix77: Can do empty for little rep, bestter to fill for lots of rep per box
[1:45:51] DrnknMnky79: 300 rep if you add things to it. 100 rep if you don't
[1:45:53] Pups_Gersky: Single turn in gives min. rep - Full crates will give you the highest rep.
[1:45:54] Rhymm: you can turn them in empty or full, you get more rep if they are full
[1:45:56] LoftyKing: Did one yesterday you get like 15 Silver and tons of rep
[1:45:56] Molvonos: The empties stop giving rep at honored, I think.
[1:45:57] maventar: Yea
[1:45:57] cyrex172: it gives rep empty ? didnt know that
[1:45:57] SonofHorus82: fill the box and turn in for a some money and rep, or turn in empty for less money and less rep.
[1:45:58] Molvonos: But yea, friendly
[1:45:58] strongstout: just to friendly
[1:45:59] Alaquane: depends on the boxes you find
[1:46:05] Alaquane: 100-800. very rng
[1:46:12] pigzip: fill the ones you can like leather or mining
[1:46:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no
[1:46:16] Molvonos: Negative
[1:46:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: box are bop
[1:46:21] KroniclyLazy: soulbound
[1:46:21] Domukari: no waylaid are bop
[1:46:21] Rune_Phoenix77: must be farmed
[1:46:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: loot only
[1:46:23] Alaquane: you have to keep kiling mobs or open world chests
[1:46:23] Molvonos: Killing/from chests.
[1:46:23] Verdell263: Chests usually have 1
[1:46:23] FoolMonty: you can bank them
[1:46:27] Eviltuna13: bring for them
[1:46:29] cbiskit89: boxes stack if they are full
[1:46:31] Holysal: you can hold more if you fill them
[1:46:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: you can buy the shit to fill them in AH
[1:46:31] Molvonos: Also, the 'delete and save crates' thing doesnt work anymore.
[1:46:32] SonofHorus82: also, the boxes are unique and soulbound so you can only ever carry one and cant trade them.
[1:46:33] Pups_Gersky: Yes you can hold more than 1 ONLY IF its filled.
[1:46:36] gelimarr: if you can fulfill the box, you can own more than 1 box
[1:46:37] Molvonos: They hotfixed it
[1:46:42] maccaruso: Nope
[1:46:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: chests have a high drop rate of them
[1:46:50] Holysal: buy the mats to fill the box
[1:46:51] geokouts: bank alts
[1:46:54] drunkappalachian: nope, get a box, go to town, turn in repeat
[1:47:03] spansonite1: towBleedpurple
[1:47:10] maventar: Same person
[1:47:12] Alaquane: just buy it
[1:47:14] Rune_Phoenix77: redridge mountains gnolls 3 chest area north of town is where i farmed mine, quick FP to SW
[1:47:15] strongstout: buy it from the same vendor
[1:47:15] drunkappalachian: i voted for shaman to try to save you this grind lol
[1:47:19] ic3k0ld: It's quicker to get the tier 2 boxes and fill those
[1:47:19] Eviltuna13: 2gold for the rune
[1:47:20] Domukari: no just turn in enough
[1:47:24] Domukari: then can buy
[1:47:26] Alaquane: get friendly, the person you turn it into turns into a vendor. like 2g for rune
[1:47:29] zhr0: Run around loot the world chests
[1:47:32] SonofHorus82: vendor is the same person. 2 gold per rune.
[1:47:33] geokouts: friendly and buy it for 2g
[1:47:34] maventar: Gives the items once u are friendly
[1:47:34] Treevinal: They just need to add the vendor to every hub and it would be much better
[1:47:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no because higher boxes give more rep
[1:47:38] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Rune_Phoenix77 (warning)
[1:47:40] KroniclyLazy: go farm the first mine in elwynn
[1:47:40] tlsmith3638: i heard there a higher chance of them showing up in chest if you can find aplace lot of  chest  can farm those
[1:47:41] Pups_Gersky: Higher chance to get the crates from loot chest
[1:47:46] JotsAwn: the low level boxes only give rep through friendly
[1:47:47] KroniclyLazy: chest have a really high drop rate
[1:47:48] ic3k0ld: those are teir 1 and give less rep
[1:47:50] zhr0: Lower drop chance from killing mobs
[1:47:57] Domukari: I knocked 2 birds by killing fulborgs in ashenvale, grinding that rep as well.
[1:47:58] zwulf: oh but hey atleast is not honored anymore
[1:47:59] geokouts: you can also buy a 10 slot bag and an agility boot
[1:47:59] ArcaneSyntax: The gnolls in Elwyn are the best for box farming until friendly @towelliee
[1:48:00] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: higher boxes give more rep
[1:48:00] cbiskit89: lucky for you it's friendly now and not honored
[1:48:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: there are 2 levels of box ilvl the higher ones from the higher near 25 zones drop boxes that give higher rep
[1:48:28] kickassassins: how does rogue keep agg on large packs of mobs?
[1:48:41] cuba1509: 1 raiders from cuba1509 have joined! 
[1:48:42] ArcaneSyntax: Honored took me like 3 hours?
[1:48:45] kickassassins: with no aoe anyone know?
[1:48:45] KroniclyLazy: it only takes about 2 hours to farm enough crates for friendly in the right spot
[1:48:47] ic3k0ld: I just got honored on my rogue and then they made the change
[1:48:50] Pups_Gersky: Just put together a farming group, have everyone land a chest then go turn in yours then have em trade you theirs all at the NPC and you should be good.
[1:49:06] Submarine_Mike: takes a lot of killing in there
[1:49:11] ArcaneSyntax: Higher level boxes give way more rep and I played a human

[1:49:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: you can not trade the box
[1:49:38] SonofHorus82: no. the boxes are soulbound
[1:49:41] JotsAwn: That grind is easy for horde.  Quillboar camps in southern barrens have tons of chest spawns and are high enough level to drop the honored tier
[1:49:41] Submarine_Mike: mines Soulbound
[1:49:44] drunkappalachian: no, its bop

[1:50:13] Eviltuna13: chests disappear after a few min once opened I thought
[1:50:37] spansonite1: ty
[1:50:41] gelimarr: towF

[5:20:15] Turco11: purchased the 3 pack
[5:20:17] AzedaNA: Does Blizzard not get some kind of cut from those sales? Why would they not advertise it
[5:20:20] TheUnknowing: so much missed opportunity
[5:20:27] zombie_snacks666: I knew about the McFarlane figures but that's because I already follow them for Spawn stuff
[5:20:58] megasep007: opportunity missed
[5:20:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: incompetence
[5:20:59] MrFrying: @AzedaNA Oh I'm sure they do, they would be dumb not to
[5:20:59] Nokterian: McFarlane has making a lot of stuff for many years
[5:21:07] AzedaNA: @Towelliee Go work for Blizzard's social team. They will think you're a fucking genius
[5:21:10] Pups_Gersky: I don't think they have a marketing team anymore to reach out beyond what they have now.
[5:21:57] chefdejour82: lol
[5:22:07] Arocian: multi dollar company
[5:22:11] Nokterian: LuL

[5:22:38] Arocian: no shot
[5:22:44] Turco11: imagine if they started promoting now.....rest of WoW community finds out.....our cards just went up in value lol
[5:22:50] Pups_Gersky: That's wild.. I hope they don't take legal action against companies for using their IP and such...
[5:22:50] Arocian: why aren't they like blasting this info internally
[5:22:53] Nokterian: rooKek
[5:23:01] MrFrying: well if Blizzard is that incompetent what can we make and sell without them ever find out and make 100% of the sale
[5:23:01] SonofHorus82: yikes. I'm sure that's a thing that MS will want to fix.
[5:23:04] AzedaNA: The only time I have seen Blizzard shill for other companies and their products is when it's the really expensive ones
[5:23:10] Ezcotli: I only know of the cards because of this channel
[5:23:23] AzedaNA: Shit. FFXIV never misses a beat to advertise other companies selling their merch
[5:23:27] DrkPhoenix6913: theres no mounts/toys/pets in the packs, most people (outside of card collectors) probably dont bite...
[5:23:37] Galadeon: Upperdeck would have had a merchandise/trademark deal with someone at Activision.  Left hand meet Right hand.
[5:24:11] DrkPhoenix6913: id blow my load if there was mounts and shit

[5:26:12] drunkappalachian: the problem with TCG mounts is that scalpers will buy all the boxes and then sell the mounts for insane prices
[5:26:13] SonofHorus82: they just didnt include the loot cards like Upper Deck was.
[5:26:15] N7Spectr3: minus video games digital is the way to go.
[5:26:17] drunkappalachian: real fans will never get a shot
