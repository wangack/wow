[1:07:12] dosavy: mop season 1
[1:07:16] poxpoxxd: First season on MOP rogue was worst all specs, remember ? @Whaazz
[1:07:23] Lordshaftington: so what you're saying is all specs of rogue are busted
[1:07:28] Deathmarkedx: i cant remember a triple dps spec class being trash other than warlocks in s1 of sl and maybe s2
[1:07:35] Lordshaftington: because you have 500 buttons that do the same shit.
[1:07:42] Akurax: @Whaazz would u say warr is easier or harder then assa rogue in shuffle to play?
[1:07:48] Lordshaftington: cloak a disarm bro who wanted this honor talent added?
[1:08:05] Lordshaftington: always have an answer
[1:08:05] blackvpnv: even fire can do decent in some shufle
[1:08:07] sarent02: isnt fire the same as in sl?
[1:08:14] sarent02: whats the big diffrence
[1:08:18] andrethegiant1: fire is absolut garbage
[1:08:23] zeranni1: also the chances of 3 specs being bad compared to a class with only 1 dps spec
[1:08:24] AshvirTV: Lets be real, Rogue mage players have had to adapt for years so they are just far superior players, hence making people think they are op
[1:08:26] rogerscruton1: cloak melee immune is weird idk
[1:08:27] lagunax: Any 3s with lontar ?
[1:08:36] Deathmarkedx: it makes u better on everything else too
[1:08:40] sarent02: assa is super esay

[1:08:46] Deathmarkedx: cause u learn to track everything
[1:08:58] Justinky1: even just warrior having a ton of spells off GCD
[1:09:12] uncannysword: there's a reason all the top streamers are rogue 🤔
[1:09:15] sarent02: mop toolkit was crazy
[1:09:19] Akurax: @Whaazz would u say warr is easier or harder then assa rogue in shuffle to play?
[1:09:25] bobthegoblin_: @uncannysword what are u smoking
[1:09:28] wonderwise111: any streaming plans after wow completly dies?
[1:09:29] NPBeharry: I like when a player plays rogue and warrior they are usually insanely good
[1:09:32] Deathmarkedx: assa is easy compared to the other 2 specs. not to other melee overall
[1:09:59] jBeastwood: assa has a big defensive skill curve
[1:09:59] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:10:41] Feroxita1337: so the 20% dmg reduce from the feint talent isnt worth at all anymore?
[1:10:46] no_way_: and we love you
[1:10:58] martinuslol: I find combat to be the easiest specc for me, cause blade flurry does so much since 90% is melee lobbies @Whaazz

[1:25:15] Raeckles: Kappa
[1:25:16] jBeastwood: Healers have to min-max the amount of tools they have to use to make them & their team live. To me that depends on if it's intentional, and if they lare repeating the same mistake

[1:29:44] Deathmarkedx: a lot of times you overlap because they never press high
[1:30:13] Reeceboss: @Deathmarkedx but what if u should press high instead of the healer
[1:30:14] Reeceboss: how would the healer know

[2:17:14] qkmood: its a fan fav spec but hard to play for low elo

[2:19:38] Deathmarkedx: outlaw is extremely complicated as a spec
[2:19:43] Deathmarkedx: id say its easily the most complicated melee after feral
[2:19:51] Deathmarkedx: when it comes to doing dmg that is
[2:20:22] venturejr: what is your BTE macro?

[2:24:50] blindwolfofficial: what makes ele op on eu, i find myself on my ele getting ran at by melee cleaves every game >.<
[2:24:51] ExoliaTV: it will never be fixed until they add deserter debuff if you miss Q, which should be increased each time you miss, and bnet wide
[2:25:00] chuechi: if vanish has more tha 45 sec cd and dance more than 12 sec you can press out of stealth
[2:25:06] artagore: Tricky :S
