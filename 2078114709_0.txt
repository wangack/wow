[0:09:36] Arthaskan: hi friend
[0:09:45] aginsb: im not doing trading online
[0:10:13] aginsb: maybe once I know whats good more
[0:10:14] Spyke_ZGZ: Oh fuck it's Friday
[0:10:19] Spyke_ZGZ: The first time in months I care
[0:11:07] aginsb: think about what level you got your guild to offline. For trading, you can sell early but buying items depends on the guild tier
[0:12:03] aginsb: what kinds of items you can buy
[0:12:14] aginsb: yes
[0:12:35] Ghrimm: yo yo
[0:13:17] aginsb: so items with the guild symbol are locked to you in that guild
[0:13:37] aginsb: and you can only give items to friends if they either were in game with you when they dropped or you find a resonance for that person
[0:14:11] Ghrimm: making another mage?
[0:14:26] StreamElements: Looking for uber chads to game with? Check out the 'Looking for Group' channels in the Discord, https://discord.gg/Zeegers
[0:14:45] aginsb: if your item dropped as the result of the circle of fortune bonuses, it will not be tradable either way
[0:15:00] Ghrimm: items arent tradeable unless ur merchant guild
[0:15:08] Ghrimm: u can "gift" to those u play with
[0:15:23] aginsb: also you cant flip stuff in the trade guild
[0:15:40] Ghrimm: no
[0:15:46] Ghrimm: im circle of fortune

[0:16:51] Sergeles: the thing to be warned about is right now under the current balance you cant realistically trade most of the good stuff until you hit lvl 100ish. practically, its good for idols and exalted weapons as you are levelling. the rest is good for min/max or 2nd character
[0:17:22] Sergeles: i went primalist totems

[0:57:38] Spyke_ZGZ: The appeal, at least to me, is the game is precisely as easy or hard as you want it.
[0:57:57] Spyke_ZGZ: Everything can "beat the game" but once you start pushing the endgame content it goes endless so eventually you will get fucked.
