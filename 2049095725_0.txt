[0:03:55] jarlo123: @Hydramist excited to see how ur tierlistchanges based on new datamined runes
[0:04:02] Docta_Scarecrow: Good morning from the US mate (touring with the band over here). Hope you've been well!
[0:04:22] Sinostra: Hey Ryan !
[0:04:26] Sinostra: gonna bfd ?
[0:04:38] feodred10: Ele, Warr, Disc, Shadow, Shockadin (I think), Enhance and Hunter should all be very strong right?
[0:04:44] CreasesPieces: good avo
[0:04:47] feodred10: Boomkin maybe too
[0:05:05] Docta_Scarecrow: Yeah man! Doing well thanks
[0:05:05] Sinostra: @feodred10 you forgot feral
[0:05:45] jarlo123: warlocks looking weak tho p2
[0:05:51] Kreynz: mage is going to be so broken
[0:06:12] satras12: epic 2h axe is 2.7 speed lol
[0:06:19] Sinostra: @jarlo123 yeah, but come P3, we'll get back to a strong power level
[0:06:30] jarlo123: p3 locks will be clappin hard
[0:06:55] feodred10: Destro locks in particular I think will be strong asf
[0:07:15] Sinostra: destro still doesn't have SF
[0:07:25] Sinostra: its main casting window opener
[0:07:43] Sinostra: how many classes get a MS effect in classic ?
[0:07:50] Sinostra: war and rogue ?
[0:07:54] Kreynz: not rogue
[0:07:56] Kreynz: only war
[0:07:58] abatement454: @Hydramist are u more excited for druid or priest for p2 pvp?
[0:08:01] Sinostra: oh
[0:08:06] Sinostra: even better then
[0:08:09] Kreynz: wound is weird in classic
[0:08:09] bcalicore: is he talking?

[0:08:42] feodred10: I’m a dwarf so if I’m only dealing with rogues every 2 minutes I’m fine
[0:08:52] feodred10: dwarf hunt at that
[0:09:03] bcalicore: no way sacred shield absorbs 500 right?
[0:09:52] lHlUlLlK: lHlUlLlK watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! wow i'm a loser
[0:10:16] MrDeadDorian: @Hydramist thoughts 'bout Alonso in Liverpool?
[0:10:28] BenBenz: i dont think all the tooltips are done, the feral runes dont make sense at all
[0:10:34] Grodisx: Grodisx watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! yeee
[0:10:37] BenBenz: or gore doenst
[0:10:43] Kreynz: spriest will be a good healer in pve next phase
[0:10:48] Sinostra: why does gore not make sense ?
[0:10:51] Extramediums: well, spriest will have mana regen finally, so I expect it to do well
[0:11:20] Kreynz: assuming gnomer is as much of a joke as bfd
[0:11:30] Kreynz: you will run spriest + mage healer if u wanna maximize dmg

[0:11:35] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[0:11:54] saund: they made the new 2h from gnomeregan 2.70 speed so stupid lmao
[0:11:55] Extramediums: I imagine they'll keep it around 3~ mins or maybe 5 to keep in line with vanilla cd's in general
[0:12:19] saund: epic from gnomeregan is 2.70 speed, then the STV rep one is 3.60 but a mace, can't use either
[0:12:23] CreasesPieces: what you running p2 prof wise hydra? engi / tailor?
[0:12:34] feodred10: enhance shaman’s with 60% with 2h I think has potential to be a little fuckin scary
[0:12:42] BenBenz: @Sinostra it says "lacerate, swipe and maul have 15% chance to reset cooldown of mangle (bear)" . But you cant have lacerate and mangle at the same time
[0:12:43] Hydramist: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zWcGy_5iN3I
[0:12:47] Hydramist: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/whsspOptlpI
[0:12:54] Kreynz: they did the same thing with fathomblade
[0:12:54] saund: would be toxic if not, we'd be stuck with whirlwind all phase
[0:13:01] feodred10: swinging a 1h speed weap for a 3.0+ weap speed with 150+ top-end weap
[0:13:14] saund: btw you think tauren warrior might be a sleeper pick at 40?
[0:13:17] saund: over orc
[0:13:36] feodred10: I don’t think so Sayin’s
[0:13:39] feodred10: Saund **
[0:13:45] o_lark: did you see they added a greater insignia of the horde?
[0:14:12] feodred10: mainly particularly because you’ll be able to charge and cept in combat
[0:14:14] Kreynz: wonder if it works on silence/disarm as well
[0:14:16] Kreynz: or if it's like wrath
[0:14:18] feodred10: and those stuns will Dr with your stomp
[0:14:37] saund: 5% more stamina, prot likely being really good, and last stand
[0:14:49] dreeeamyy: Gday o/
[0:14:49] Danimal_Media: 99 parses?
[0:15:10] dreeeamyy: ohh little boomie time
[0:15:18] feodred10: vs rogue stuns, conc stun from hunter, shadow priest stun, other warrior stuns
[0:15:21] Kreynz: yeah that looks so dumb
[0:15:23] Kreynz: why is it 30 seconds?
[0:15:32] Kreynz: surely that's a troll and it's fake
[0:15:48] dreeeamyy: that guildname translates to ”fuck buddies at the cemetary” xD
[0:15:58] dreeeamyy: kk på kyrkogården
[0:16:02] Dlax: how hard is it to solo heal on fresh priest?
[0:16:28] garmok1979: duuuuuude, g'mornin. Hope you kick lots of alliance butt today
[0:16:35] feodred10: I think Hpal will be tough, but raw healing a priest will wipe the floor with pally
[0:16:39] feodred10: in p2
[0:16:39] Dlax: i mean, its pre raid bis, but not raid geared
[0:16:48] bcalicore: hpal pvp gods tho
[0:16:53] bcalicore: if these runes are true
[0:17:04] bcalicore: like s+++++
[0:17:08] Kreynz: yeah i read those runes and immediately thought of making a pally
[0:17:11] Kreynz: but i just can't be fucked
[0:17:24] Nelhage: !runes
[0:17:24] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[0:17:42] dreeeamyy: Hydra getting wotlk ptsd flashbacks from Sacred Shield
[0:17:47] Kreynz: thing is too crit is insane for hpal in classic cause they get 100% mana back from crits
[0:17:52] Kreynz: so them getting all this crit is insane
[0:18:32] feodred10: another thing, Warr’s won’t be nowhere near as controllable as they were in old nilla. intervene will get them out of roots if they can get to a nearby target, they get intercept, warbringer allows them to get out of all impairing effects if they can charge, cept or vene
[0:18:37] saund: you got two warriors
[0:18:42] saund: tell one of them to man up
[0:18:47] dreeeamyy: Im alliance ):
[0:18:56] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:19:44] feodred10: I want to level a priest so bad but IMO Dwarf is far and away better than undead and I already have 2 alli 25 lol
[0:19:53] feodred10: need more horde 25 char’s
[0:20:10] Sinostra: what's wrong with alliance ?
[0:20:29] feodred10: nothing, I like to have a balance of faction char’s.
[0:20:39] feodred10: I have more alli than horde already
[0:20:43] Schmuts93: What do you think about shadow priest in phase 2 with the info we have now?
[0:21:38] Bloch29: Elemental Shaman Hype Elemental Shaman Hype Elemental Shaman Hype
[0:21:40] Dlax: i need to get that bloody staff
[0:21:53] feodred10: but undead priest will have THREE DoTs due to racial
[0:22:04] feodred10: racial dot, SWP and Void Plague
[0:22:05] KungKotz: Spriest looks AMAZING
[0:22:24] KungKotz: gon be my alt for sure
[0:23:11] feodred10: lmao male gnome death
[0:23:45] Kreynz: i think mindflay will be very good at 50 with the dot crit rune and the +50% mind flay dmg rune
[0:23:51] Kreynz: if you can get a decent bit of crit
[0:24:01] Sinostra: still no aquatic form, eh ?
[0:24:51] feodred10: I personally think people that are underrating mages need to consider the fact that they’ll be TBC level strong if a mage with deep freeze. they may not need a lot of rune changes like some other classes for
[0:25:18] Kreynz: who is underrating mage
[0:25:20] Kreynz: it's gonna be insane
[0:25:27] feodred10: If they come out fucking Lance Spam killing people like tbc people won’t be thinking they didn’t need great runes
[0:25:39] feodred10: on my server yesterday on trade chat people were talking about it
[0:25:51] feodred10: hell even still lol, Lance spamming in nova’d will be stupid strong
[0:25:54] Kreynz: mage is gonna be the best pve healer next phase imo
[0:25:58] dreeeamyy: I watched Alien btw, it was great
[0:26:02] feodred10: lmao true
[0:26:08] feodred10: I was just saying those peolle
[0:26:39] Kreynz: aliens 2 is goated
[0:26:47] dreeeamyy: Yeah it was great, kinda mindblowing its so old, it held up really well like u said
[0:26:53] Macdaddyswag69: which runes next phase? belt and boots?
[0:27:08] feodred10: I’m ready for Kung Fu Panda 4 fuck what y’all think lmao
[0:27:32] Kreynz: apparently that scene where the alien pops out was filmed in a way where the actors were genuinely surprised

[1:09:11] Caendras_: Caendras_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:09:35] hiraethonhs: would u take 99 parse balance drood or 70 parse warrior? I would go for war KEK
[1:09:43] Danimal_Media: think its updated
[1:09:44] Danimal_Media: logs
[1:09:54] Caendras_: So... with these new runes we are rerolling Paladin, right? Kappa
[1:09:56] wreckedgum: SHADOW DREAM INC
[1:10:14] Sinostra: is a 100 parse possible ?
[1:10:24] Geffor: Does it take into account ilvl?
[1:10:42] Yesnig: @Hydramist hey hydra it´s me again i asked you a couple of days ago if shadow is viable in pvp yes but also in pve ?
[1:11:26] Skipiz852: is 100 means u top1 ?
[1:11:28] hiraethonhs: hard to parse as hunter rn cause all got parses when bm was broken
[1:11:29] ama__deus: Shadow probably kinda shit in PVE still, but whatever
[1:11:40] Kreynz: spriest will be a very good healer for pve imo
[1:11:52] ImOdyssey: Can you roll on the damage/healing gear as disc priest p2? or will casters get mad
[1:11:53] BenBenz: i had a 100 parse in classic ssc. i glitched the special weapons from TK and killed the voidwalker boss after xD
[1:12:07] sicnote: had a few 100s on rogue in classic and a couple TBC spriest
[1:12:07] BenBenz: or "glitched"
[1:12:10] Wubsie: parses on healers are silly thought. carry the healing, 40% parse. do 20 dps, 95% parse
[1:12:17] Skipiz852: @ImOdyssey true
[1:12:23] BenBenz: it was not a glitch lots of ppl abused it
[1:12:29] Skipiz852: @Wubsie yeah took me a while to understand
[1:12:31] ama__deus: @Wubsie kinda why nobody cares about healer parses tbh
[1:12:43] Skipiz852: i was like wtf im carrying heals ,but my parses are shit
[1:12:44] ama__deus: OIther than really smooth brains
[1:12:46] hiraethonhs: why do healers get parses dpsing tbh, makes no sense
[1:12:51] hiraethonhs: why not parse healing
[1:13:01] Kreynz: i had a look at the top healer parses on the turtle boss and the entire raid is taking like 2k+ dmg from the bubbles
[1:13:13] abatement454: !talents
[1:13:13] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8

[1:16:14] Bloch29: Hi mom and dad, I'm on youtube!
[1:16:30] xdingerx92: pve build too?
[1:16:32] dominozxx: apparently the helm an bracer runes wont be put in phase 2
[1:17:30] prodigy_wow: I made an interesting spec last night if I can show you
[1:21:06] Yesnig: is this for pve or pvp
[1:21:49] CreasesPieces: pvp
[1:21:50] Kyfoon: pvp
[1:22:19] twitchara7: penance wont cancel shadowform tho
[1:24:23] LesGoTV: shadowfiend will be a book
[1:24:32] ama__deus: @LesGoTV we don't know that yet
[1:24:42] dominozxx: yo helm and bracer runes wont be in phase 2
[1:24:49] dominozxx: so theres no point making this
[1:25:02] ama__deus: @dominozxx he prefaced this by saying that FeelsWeirdMan
[1:25:22] dominozxx: cool bro just sayin
[1:26:20] Bloch29: I am Laust
[1:26:22] crokette_: Im probably making my SP my main
[1:26:25] crokette_: And im still only 24 ahah
[1:26:34] ama__deus: @crokette_ definitely lost then Kappa
[1:26:38] Bloch29: @crokette_ go ele main, shadow alt
[1:26:45] twitchara7: deals shadow fiend decent amount of dmg?
[1:27:11] Leqt: You like playing balance mate?
[1:27:15] prodigy_wow: Will you make a solo disc pvp spec? Like a level 40 version of the current playatyle
[1:27:17] VersusGamesFL: @twitchara7 i think it's damage is scaled off of your SP?
[1:27:22] VersusGamesFL: i could be wrong
[1:27:26] prodigy_wow: Playstyle*
[1:27:27] Florentzen: are some runes still not found seems like there is no shadow run for headpiece?
[1:27:30] tharuzim: tharuzim subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hi
[1:27:35] optik_rec0rds: @Hydramist did you have time to share the custom classicauraduration? sodaL
[1:27:47] Kreynz: giving shadowfiend for free as a skill ability book sounds a bit silly
[1:27:53] Kreynz: it should definitely take up a rune slot lol
[1:28:05] prodigy_wow: I was thinking like points in disc with holy nova and blackout
[1:28:05] ama__deus: Likely will
[1:28:10] Florentzen: !runes
[1:28:11] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[1:28:46] flugrman: is dagger with off hand bis next phase ? seems like epic bfd rod is pretty close
[1:28:53] ama__deus: Will suck that you have to respec for PVE as shadow Sadge
[1:28:57] Bloch29: Should Ele shams still go way of earth on legs for next phase?
[1:28:58] virucs: we are looking at a cow hydra
[1:29:04] rosso5792: we cant see shit
[1:29:07] tilta1337: will you go disc or shadow s2 ?
[1:29:08] Dlax: we cant see xD
[1:29:14] Dlax: ty!
[1:29:26] Kreynz: yeah i had something similar for my template
[1:29:42] turn2spikejester: Redemption rune seems REALLY strong. 30seconds of non-stop healing for free
[1:29:49] Kreynz: i instead went for holy nova over blackout
[1:29:51] Kreynz: but ye probs not worth
[1:30:25] DuduIsFTeam: Redemption rune its pretty strong tho, i think they'll prob nerf it
[1:30:28] Sinostra: @turn2spikejester it's weird they made a run that requires a specific spec tbh
[1:30:28] gitzw: what about deep holy?
[1:30:31] Treseck: man, redemption rune would be a absolute dream
[1:30:48] lordlaesooor: im noob so i love redemption rune
[1:30:57] Shyne_420: !runes
[1:30:57] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[1:31:05] LesGoTV: yea that spec looks insane
[1:31:07] EkenTV: Do you think feral will be ok or will everyone just be boomies?
[1:31:10] prodigy_wow: This looks like it could be a really fun build
[1:31:18] prodigy_wow: Not needing to pop in and out of shadow
[1:31:44] Kreynz: level 50 talent builds will be a bit more interesting
[1:32:40] optik_rec0rds: we need mop lightwell
[1:32:49] Sinostra: level 40 smite build, let's go
[1:32:53] rosso5792: what are you gonna use for leveling and spec?
[1:32:55] raags_: sorry Was that shadow build?
[1:33:01] raags_: i missed it
[1:33:07] gitzw: you get like 40-50 sp from holy
[1:33:08] jaimonji: Isnt the spirit > sp worth it
[1:33:48] Florentzen: deep shadow build?
[1:34:05] Kreynz: lightwell has to be the worst 31 talent in the game
[1:34:07] jaimonji: the only points worth it at holy are the final ones
[1:34:14] jaimonji: @Kreynz its hunger for blood
[1:34:14] prodigy_wow: Can't wait to PI my casters in raid :D, sadly I won't be able to pvp and love with the same spec without griefing
[1:34:27] prodigy_wow: PVE*
[1:34:28] crokette_: Gonna do my first raid as a priest, I assume R1 renew to proc POM, then mainly heal with penance and flash heal that's it?
[1:34:48] jaimonji: mind spike doesnt remove DoTs here wich is cool
[1:34:56] ch0wder92: @crokette_ SMOrc
[1:35:15] Kreynz: if ur not using pom then rank 2 heal is good
[1:35:41] crokette_: freak that was a quick explanation, how do i clip ahah
[1:35:47] ama__deus: Will be hard to let go of the homies Sadge
[1:36:10] Sinostra: the shadisc build
[1:36:14] ch0wder92: thats the build
[1:36:27] ch0wder92: cant punish shadow or holy
[1:36:28] ama__deus: @Sinostra discow build? pbtvDANCE
[1:36:29] jaimonji: "as disc"
[1:36:43] Sinostra: @ama__deus yeah, better xD
[1:36:51] Skipiz852: does shadow viewing apply from dots too ?
[1:36:52] Skipiz852: ticks
[1:37:02] jaimonji: why is head and wrist empty?
[1:37:06] prodigy_wow: @skipiz852 just the application of the spell
[1:37:22] ama__deus: Empowered renew, though? HUH
[1:37:34] UnTalMacsi: !runes
[1:37:34] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[1:37:43] lordlaesooor: show cat
[1:38:05] yeahboimp4s: will u go hybrid specc or full shadow at 40?
[1:38:13] Noitheknight333: No pain supression?
[1:38:39] ch0wder92: i like reach tho, 2/5 weaving
[1:38:50] jaimonji: despair or surge of light?
[1:39:13] Kreynz: shadowform with unbreakable will and healing focus i guess
[1:39:47] Bloch29: you think we will get Shadow Mend rune in a later phase?
[1:40:03] ch0wder92: shadow mend xd
[1:40:11] ama__deus: I just want improved inner fire, improved shield and shadow form EZ
[1:40:13] prodigy_wow: With helm and bracer rune smite spec might be okay
[1:40:13] dinnerjr: !runes
[1:40:13] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[1:40:23] prodigy_wow: A crit holy nova would give you an instant smite
[1:40:29] YBEOK: why no bracers rune?
[1:40:31] shiftbbg: it says 40% of base mana there but in game the amount shown isnt 40%?
[1:40:41] ch0wder92: feathers would be insane, but busted
[1:40:46] shiftbbg: ahh
[1:40:49] shiftbbg: yes
[1:40:57] jaimonji: smite spec not worth it over silence
[1:41:33] Kreynz: i hate how surge of light procs from crits, isn't it usually just a % based proc?
[1:41:39] ch0wder92: please make pennance proc inspiration? does it?
[1:41:52] MannySJ: Heyge
[1:42:14] jaimonji: having mind spike i dont think smite spec is worth it
[1:42:23] jaimonji: more worth it cast
[1:42:30] optik_rec0rds: would dots snapshot with innerfocus?
[1:42:40] jaimonji: and it doesnt remove dots
[1:43:24] LesGoTV: Why do you think mind blast isnt that strong
[1:43:40] eliadkek: !runes
[1:43:41] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[1:43:52] Kreynz: i feel like spriest is lacking a crit damage talent or rune or something like it has in later expansions
[1:43:57] jaimonji: What would be a 2s build if they added it
[1:43:59] LesGoTV: 15% + 15% + 10% + 50% + new rank + 90% crit + 43 coefficient with sp
[1:44:09] LesGoTV: its prob gona be critting around 800
[1:44:12] LesGoTV: if not more

[1:44:20] Bloch29: You don't think we can 1shot with MB next phase?
[1:44:33] LesGoTV: you´re right
[1:44:37] jaimonji: What would be a 2s build if they added 2s
[1:44:38] LesGoTV: but even without a crit
[1:44:39] LesGoTV: into death
[1:44:45] LesGoTV: will be pretty good
[1:45:16] prodigy_wow: Just need a mage to deep freeze for you:)
[1:45:25] xdingerx92: can you do shadow pve build and runes
[1:45:27] ama__deus: I dunno. Mind flay never really did it for me Sadge
[1:45:28] ch0wder92: martydom lowkey goated
[1:45:30] mr_pobdoq: new tierlist when?
[1:45:30] Kreynz: mindflay will pump once u get the dots can crit rune
[1:45:36] jaimonji: would you rather have penance or death in wrath 2s
[1:45:42] optik_rec0rds: is there a world where we are not picking void plague?
[1:45:52] ama__deus: @Kreynz does mindflay even count as a dot?
[1:45:59] lowers87: !runes
[1:45:59] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[1:46:04] Kreynz: @ama__deus yes
[1:46:08] ama__deus: TIL SeemsGood
[1:46:09] Kreynz: thats why it can't crit in the first place
[1:46:34] ama__deus: Makes sense when you put it like that
[1:46:49] LesGoTV: Precise timing
[1:46:55] LesGoTV: and intervene
[1:46:56] LesGoTV: prob
[1:46:57] LesGoTV: if grps
[1:47:05] eadgaar: precising timing as more consistent
[1:47:07] LesGoTV: yea
[1:47:19] eadgaar: endless rage on gloves
[1:47:27] LesGoTV: Yea cuz u got endless rage instead of quick strike
[1:47:37] LesGoTV: and 20% attack speed on 2h, rage prob wont be a problwem
[1:48:20] jaimonji: would you rather have penance or death in wrath arena
[1:48:58] eadgaar: Casters are getting much to keep warrior in S
[1:49:49] eadgaar: range on judgement probably
[1:49:51] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Rets are likely to pick the most stupid and most broken runes imaginable of course nadedDerp
[1:50:27] LesGoTV: all 3 paladin specs look pretty strong for pvp
[1:51:01] unrealsiv: 40 yard judgements kinda mad
[1:51:36] LesGoTV: Yea and with that talent seal of martyrdom will start peaking, since the judgements from martyrdom actually slap whereas SOC judgement is trash
[1:54:16] Bloch29: It doesn't increase Judegement to 30 yards, it increases it by 30+ it's current range.
[1:54:31] prodigy_wow: Yeah that's how it is in wotlk
[1:54:39] ugyesgyerek: 10yd
[1:54:42] Kreynz: 10 yards is default i think
[1:54:43] eadgaar: 10
[1:54:47] Bloch29: so it will be 40
[1:54:55] ugyesgyerek: but sheath of light would give 200 spellpower
[1:54:57] eadgaar: no idea why 40 yard spells are currently mainstream
[1:54:59] Bloch29: that's kinda nutty
[1:55:03] Itshighnoonwotlk: gna be like wotlk
[1:55:45] prodigy_wow: I absolutely despite that cringe ability
[1:55:45] unrealsiv: they don't know what they doing haha
[1:55:51] prodigy_wow: It's power word shield on crack
[1:55:52] unrealsiv: sacred shield is disgusting
[1:55:55] deltrexx: sheath of light + sacred shield if it crits big heal
[1:56:00] Bloch29: Sacred Shield is gonna get nerfed before launch, it is toooooo OP
[1:56:05] Kreynz: i think the number is irrelevant, probs just them trolling with datamining
[1:56:11] Kreynz: cause it doesn't say how it scales
[1:56:12] prodigy_wow: 60 second buff that creates like 20 pws's for free xd
[1:56:46] Kreynz: 30 sec but ye
[1:56:55] Bloch29: It feels like 3 runes in 1
[1:57:31] prodigy_wow: The 50% free crit + 18 crit from rune + later gear, you'll be at 100% flash heal crit
[1:57:32] Itshighnoonwotlk: hpalas was far from relevant p1, disc gonna be #1 heal still with these runes
[1:57:37] Kreynz: to be fair hpal does need a lot of help with runes to be any good in pvp xd
[1:58:02] prodigy_wow: Crit from talents is like an extra 10%
[1:58:06] Bloch29: I think Sacred Shield should be 60% max mana
[1:58:36] DoctorCactus: sacred shield is an L from design standpoint, but the rest of the toolkit feels pretty fresh gameplay wise for classic, I like it
[1:58:43] Itshighnoonwotlk: dont u get 2x magic dispel p2 or is that later? @hydra
[1:59:45] Kreynz: i'd like to see hpala get offensive dispel as a rune xd
[1:59:46] Itshighnoonwotlk: kekw
[1:59:57] LesGoTV: double offensive dispell in itself is basically better then any rune
[1:59:58] unrealsiv: @Kreynz calm down
[2:00:05] Kyfoon: i cant decide between boomie and ele shaman as main PepeHands
[2:00:24] Rayman_1990: @Kreynz Id like to see my class get bubble as a rune pls
[2:00:27] Bloch29: Go ele shammy mate
[2:00:30] ama__deus: between feral and priest for me Sadge
[2:00:32] Bloch29: Boomy will get starsurge nerf
[2:00:32] yeahboimp4s: ele get 1 rune, and its not even that good
[2:00:39] LesGoTV: Ele will be insane and will have like 5 specs to play
[2:00:42] LesGoTV: aswell as melee ele
[2:00:45] LesGoTV: with maelstrom
[2:00:58] Bloch29: @yeahboimp4s how can you say the ele rune is not good? It's S-tier
[2:00:59] Kyfoon: also tempted by feral and enh too tbh
[2:01:03] Kyfoon: think all 4 specs could be fun
[2:01:12] LesGoTV: 100% crit dmg with instant lava bursts will be nuts
[2:01:18] yeahboimp4s: @Bloch29 its not even close to s-tier
[2:01:25] Kyfoon: agree, tempted to lvl a priest and warlock atm LUL
[2:01:35] CadaveriTV: Looking forward to my mage next phase for sure
[2:01:43] Kreynz: mage is almost overwhelming in how much variation you'll have with builds
[2:01:43] dvanhelden: hunters are basically nerfed to the ground, trap launcher and some melee shit
[2:01:46] LesGoTV: true lol
[2:01:51] Itshighnoonwotlk: living flame gonna be locked entire sod innit, its like old stormscale vibes over there player wise
[2:01:58] Bloch29: @yeahboimp4s instant lava burst or chain lightning with overload mate, what u mean
[2:01:58] Tankraa: hpal is gonna have like 55% phys reduction with the new plate gear
[2:02:00] optik_rec0rds: ???? trap launcher is insane
[2:02:04] Kyfoon: trap launcher is huge KEKW
[2:02:07] ama__deus: You said the same about disc, but now you're dooming it Sadge
[2:02:31] Rayman_1990: @Tankraa I wonder how much phys reduction meta lock with sl will get
[2:03:09] optik_rec0rds: is it time to get 2 boots for open world? one with ps and one with dispersion?^^
[2:03:14] LesGoTV: @dvanhelden melee hunters will be insane with the 2 new slow fist weapons and spammable raptor strike
[2:03:14] unrealsiv: full shadow going to be broken though
[2:03:22] unrealsiv: like actually broken
[2:03:33] huffmar21: the rogue/boomkin combo gank groups in STV gonna be miserable
[2:03:41] Kyfoon: enhance shaman with the first weapons gonna be juicy
[2:03:44] Kyfoon: fist**
[2:03:50] Kyfoon: and also the 2h mace
[2:03:51] CaithUI: double shadows can deal 6.000 dmg in 3 seconds
[2:03:58] CaithUI: on one target
[2:04:04] LesGoTV: if the proc is good its game over
[2:04:12] Tankraa: when you swap runes in combat i believe that it puts the skill on cd
[2:04:20] Kyfoon: like tbc all over again with that bs mace
[2:04:24] Kyfoon: thats the one stormherald
[2:04:41] LesGoTV: it seem slike a disorient like dark edge of insanity
[2:04:46] LesGoTV: so most classes cant even trinket it
[2:04:48] Bloch29: Vanish -> swap gear
[2:05:07] optik_rec0rds: spectral guise into gearswap Kappa
[2:05:18] peetca: what do you think about warriors?
[2:05:38] Kreynz: i'd like to see them fix racials
[2:05:43] Kreynz: give wrath version of meld and human racial
[2:05:48] Bloch29: You think ele's will only use rank 1 flame shock?
[2:06:14] LesGoTV: the power surge rune might get hardcountered since theres no dispell protection for flame shock
[2:06:18] Bloch29: In group fights then
[2:06:22] Kyfoon: whats that? chocolate milk? Pog
[2:06:24] LesGoTV: LB and CL enough anyway
[2:06:33] marduxd: Mage looks quite crazy
[2:06:40] Alori_: Burns nearby enemies for (* 20 / 100) damage every 2 seconds, and reduces all magic damage taken by 10%. Lasts until cancelled.
[2:06:48] Alori_: wtf is this, so rogues cannot open on warlocks? LUL
[2:06:50] ama__deus: @LesGoTV you only need a r1 FS on targets though and those are cheap as dirt compared to dispel
[2:07:08] LesGoTV: thats not the point, its kind of a waste of global
[2:07:12] LesGoTV: vs priests
[2:07:25] Kyfoon: ele shaman just need to run around with a UA lock KEKW
[2:07:32] ikausePANIK: sup homie
[2:07:54] ama__deus: also kinda shit trading globals if it saps your mana way quicker than his LUL
[2:08:35] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Can't wait to log my rogue on the 8th and shit on everyone with mutilate envenom!! nadedDerp
[2:08:41] Istunlocklocalpensioners: ads
[2:08:46] LesGoTV: lightning bolt and chain lightning are just good enough in classic so avoiding the dispell factor vs priests will prob be more beneficial, ofc some scenarios flame shock might be worth it but yea

[2:09:46] ama__deus: It's a trap, rets. He'll ban you if you fess up Kappa
[2:09:49] ugyesgyerek: art of war feels like preg all oveer again, fast 1h+shield to have as many crits as possible for the procs

[2:11:27] Bloch29: yes
[2:11:45] CadaveriTV: I thought were only getting boots and bracer runes? Are we getting helm runes too or is that just an early data mine into P3?
[2:12:01] ama__deus: @CadaveriTV the latter
[2:12:08] TheBarehand: i think just belt and boots
[2:12:08] CadaveriTV: Thanks
[2:12:08] MVPeteTV: no way it 500

[2:12:52] drishx: let me see
[2:12:54] drishx: I play pala
[2:12:55] mixtik123: OMG they did not add sacred shield NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[2:14:25] mixtik123: Lol
[2:14:44] massesto: or guarded by the light for the mana
[2:14:45] drishx: @Hydramist it's worded the exact same, the only difference is that on wrath it's up to 12 sec instead of 6 also on wrath it absorbs 600 dmg on base. So that's a pretty crazy sacred shield
[2:15:06] mixtik123: Lmao
[2:15:17] Istunlocklocalpensioners: nadedW
[2:15:18] MVPeteTV: what is pws at 40?

[2:15:27] mixtik123: I hope this turns out good lol
[2:15:28] Schmuts93: might aswell be 200 dmg, those numbers from datamining tend to be wrong
[2:15:31] roger_podacter: like 390

[2:21:21] Bloch29: is*
[2:21:24] ugyesgyerek: dont know what steady will look like, cast/instant?
[2:21:26] Krowlios: 60% range is pretty bad
[2:21:36] CaithUI: expose is 1k shred
[2:21:52] flowen001: evening all
[2:22:04] ugyesgyerek: then it's bad
[2:22:09] hiraethonhs: steady is for pve
[2:22:31] LesGoTV: I think melee specialist will be all around good
[2:22:33] LesGoTV: cuz its instnat
[2:22:35] mixtik123: Trap launch op
[2:23:09] Bloch29: It's just more dmg from the hunter instead of the pet
[2:23:14] massesto: Expose > melee tbh
[2:23:29] Dtrux_: hey hydra, whaat is your go to shadow priest at lvl40?
[2:23:43] ugyesgyerek: you dont crit a whole lot, 3s instant raptor will be good
[2:23:46] massesto: trap launcher is S teir
[2:23:51] massesto: that is gonna be huge for pvp
[2:24:09] bcalicore: melee hunter
[2:24:09] hiraethonhs: only full meele hunter
[2:24:12] hiraethonhs: which is proby meme
[2:24:19] mixtik123: Damn melee hunt looks like a thing ngl
[2:24:28] JonnySweatpants: cant see list, camera covering
[2:24:36] massesto: fire and frost traps being diff cd is giga huge
[2:24:41] ugyesgyerek: bm talents+melee spec/dual spec looks alright too
[2:24:42] ama__deus: full melee hunter is just a shittier warr LUL
[2:25:18] ugyesgyerek: nah, bm doesnt have buttons to press, i think bm will go with steady
[2:25:24] Krowlios: yes
[2:25:30] Bloch29: Kinda ye
[2:25:30] CaithUI: traps are expensive
[2:25:38] tpleym: trap launcher is above S tier
[2:25:44] LesGoTV: i honestly think melee hunter will surprise alot of ppl, even as BM or MM
[2:25:53] ugyesgyerek: only got multi shot to press, no aimed, no chimera
[2:26:09] mickster111: have you went over priest yet?
[2:26:10] Bloch29: Trap launcher just makes the hunter playstyle so much different, I love it
[2:26:26] segelduk: trap launcher with entrapment in bgs will be complete filth
[2:26:34] LesGoTV: @segelduk +
[2:26:44] ama__deus: Seems the trend so far with runes on Pala/Hunter
[2:27:07] Kataemoi: Hydra why don't you have Shockadin pala on the list?
[2:27:12] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Yes! nadedDerp
[2:27:13] tpleym: sounds good
[2:27:15] Kataemoi: Oh you do!
[2:27:23] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I like, I like it a lot!! nadedDerp
[2:27:30] abatement454: @Hydramist are u more excited for priest or druid for p2 pvp?
[2:27:30] Bossringo: where is this posted? 👀
[2:27:31] ugyesgyerek: in stv skirmish style i'd take surv, bm for 1v1-s
[2:27:49] lastad94: do you think dual wield hunter will be a thing ?
[2:27:58] Kataemoi: Do you think Sacred shield goes well with shockadin? isnt it supposed to be about burst dmg instead?
[2:29:00] LesGoTV: Thank fuck they didnt give the COS
[2:29:13] TrebekTv: prep will give you another step too xd
[2:29:17] ugyesgyerek: also Lone wolf looks to be 30% dmg, so MM might be nice with that
[2:29:20] varatupaj: 8 druids 2 priests premade in wsg :D
[2:29:20] Bloch29: Waylay is S right?
[2:29:38] lastad94: do you think dual wield hunter will be a thing ?
[2:29:47] varatupaj: blizzard devs should que and ex[irience this themselves
[2:30:06] Kataemoi: Ohh only boots, I see. Yes def. But Hydra shockadins are NOT FUN AT ALL. They can literally delete ppl in 1 single macro. Do u think the runes will make it into the game?
[2:30:48] Bloch29: But it's also 10% reduced attack speed on waylay
[2:30:54] CadaveriTV: as a mage main i am not stoked about shadowstep
[2:31:16] ama__deus: @CadaveriTV just use your new displacement rune EZ
[2:31:42] ama__deus: I wonder if the displacement part of blink, also breaks stuns FeelsThinkingMan

[2:39:07] Kataemoi: i hope, its a toxic class
[2:40:11] Locky987: so no bracer and head runes yet?
[2:40:14] NurfMe206: where da cat
[2:40:26] hzr3d: the 30% stacking mindblast crit chance is great though. mindspike is an A unless youre fully healing committed

[2:45:33] hzr3d: mindspike is just good because spammable shadow dmg and some ppl might waste kick on that and then you got free heal

[3:01:26] gia__: and you're out of combat
[3:01:32] Distorpia: redeemer is gonna be so op in AB mid fights , going priests is off the table. can't really relocate and pull back on the initial fight you'd basically give up blacksmith

[3:14:18] screwu666: that's one positive
[3:14:19] hoibi_wasmachensachen: ppl on reddit calculated that with all the buffs u can potentially do a auto attack every 0.5 sec as dual wield shaman
[3:14:23] hoibi_wasmachensachen: not dual wield
[3:14:24] frozenpizza2209: we WANTED 25% buff to 2h shaman not the dogshit attack speed lol @Hydramist

[3:26:44] Kiroxx: !prime

[3:35:39] Bloch29: Power Surge is S for group fights
[3:35:43] prodigy_wow: I bet fire nova will pump
[3:35:50] buttmcgeee: it's only 5%
[3:35:51] tpleym: what is tha chance on maelstrom
[3:35:51] prodigy_wow: Super nice when you can't cast
[3:36:03] Distorpia: totem
[3:36:18] screwu666: mind that flameshock is a short duration and a 6 sec cd, u generally need to recast it before casting next lavaburst if u manually cast it, wasn't that so?
[3:36:28] vrsswow: Sup bro!
[3:36:28] jookmeat: part of the burst for shamans
[3:36:37] Distorpia: it'll be the same dam as fire nova totem
[3:36:37] screwu666: and if u interrupt a cast, u will have to wait another 6 sec for a flameshock
[3:36:39] jookmeat: set and forget in the burst window
[3:37:17] hazt3r: 100% crit dmg on it
[3:37:24] Ixi21: question: are those runes rly all come for the 2nd phase?
[3:37:52] Ixi21: kk so they just put in the code for all -> dataminers gg :D
[3:39:58] VariceTV: No shadowfiend?
[3:40:23] bcalicore: @screwu666 flameshock dot component will proc it
[3:40:46] Kiroxx: so bags are full of duplicat items to activate runes, haha
[3:40:58] notJumu: @Hydramist decoy totem is S tier it's blessing of freedom for sham
[3:41:23] notJumu: yea it is, it allows ele to beat hunter and frost mage
[3:41:36] jijlol: your thoughts on most op out of war/rogue/priest? in pvp
[3:41:38] notJumu: gotcha
[3:42:19] screwu666: @bcalicore u still need a flameshock to crit a lavaburst
[3:42:30] ephixa_fan: hi
[3:42:41] cunderthuntz_: 5% quite low though
[3:42:43] cunderthuntz_: tbh
[3:43:01] buttmcgeee: 5% is awful considering it has a 6s cd
[3:43:05] screwu666: how long is flameshock duration and how long is his cd?
[3:43:22] Bloch29: lasts 12 sec
[3:43:22] screwu666: 1not 18 lol
[3:43:42] Bloch29: 5 chances actually
[3:43:50] Mystiggo: holy shit I missed a lot these two days I see... Disc having dispersion is wild
[3:43:51] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:44:06] screwu666: probably off ticks
[3:44:10] screwu666: we don't know
[3:44:15] Bloch29: each time it deals dmg
[3:44:24] Bloch29: so uhm not sure
[3:44:32] screwu666: it's good
[3:44:36] screwu666: but it's not broken like sacred shielkd
[3:44:40] cunderthuntz_: it will be tick for sure
[3:44:43] screwu666: 2 flameshocks at once max
[3:44:53] screwu666: and if u have to earth shock smth, then u get to have 1 that can be dispelled
[3:45:02] screwu666: it's alright
[3:45:14] Bloch29: each time must mean first time also, it's jsut dmg
[3:46:08] tpleym: 1 in 20. so if you get 6 ticks in a fight  its a 33% chance
[3:46:14] prodigy_wow: So maybe you would want to lava burst into flame shock for the chance on lava reset
[3:46:15] Distorpia: ret buffs just hit ptr
[3:46:37] lastad94: @Distorpia what ptr?
[3:46:41] Distorpia: its on wowhead
[3:47:13] lastad94: i yhought SoD doesnt have prt?
[3:47:23] hazt3r: doont think its 25% its 5% on every dmg tick
[3:47:34] Distorpia: its 1.15 ptr
[3:47:59] tpleym: yea 5% on each tick is what im assuming
[3:48:07] Bloch29: @hazt3r 5x5 = 25
[3:48:12] Kiroxx: ret fix but nothing major, posted 15min ago
[3:48:40] tpleym: yes was just saying to hazter
[3:48:40] prodigy_wow: Bro wtf 5% max mana on crusader strike, how brain dead is this class going to be

[3:49:00] screwu666: need UA on flameshock
[3:49:00] prodigy_wow: From 2 to 5 jeeesus
[3:49:05] Bloch29: Imagine if shamans get Shared Pain rune, but for Flame Shock haha
[3:49:18] hazt3r: is it 100% if there whjer 20% on every tick ?
[3:49:21] bcalicore: no thats bad math its the probability you get 0 procs over 5 ticks or .95^5 or ~77% of the time you would get no procs 23% of the time you would get a proc
[3:49:26] screwu666: relax :D let's talk about paladins
[3:49:29] bcalicore: referring to biloch
[3:49:37] screwu666: let the blue be good for once
[3:50:40] cunderthuntz_: if decoy can be used while slowed
[3:50:46] cunderthuntz_: probs higher than B
[3:50:56] cunderthuntz_: the freedom i mean
[3:51:14] Dtrux_: @Hydramist sixtyupgrades is updated!
[3:51:21] Bloch29: Only thing I want buffed as shaman right now is the range on shocks
[3:51:40] Distorpia: freedom on warrior
[3:52:13] Dtrux_: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/latest-additions
[3:52:25] Distorpia: assuming the buff is independant from the totem itself
[3:52:53] nastiku: can only assume killing the totem removed the buff, why even make it a totem if it didn't work that way?
[3:52:55] Hypnoze1407: Sick to think that you can block things or important passages with your void zone
[3:53:39] Distorpia: @Hypnoze1407 wouldn't overthink it tbh, it'll probably be shadow consecrate ^^
[3:55:53] cunderthuntz_: if its like grounding it will disappear after absorbing an attack
[3:56:23] Kiroxx: intervene totem
[3:57:15] Kiroxx: it has to be dispellable and after killing totem it has to go, lets be honest here
[3:57:41] Distorpia: it's an earth totem, can't tremor with it up
[3:58:00] Distorpia: yeah
[3:58:54] Hugo__93: i'd bet its a buff
[3:59:02] cunderthuntz_: i imagine its like grounding and disappears after it absorbs the attack but still gives buff
[3:59:03] Mystiggo: because it says 10 seconds, I feel like it'd be a buff
[3:59:09] cunderthuntz_: hopefully
[3:59:38] JavaSkrpt: 45 sec feels better
[3:59:46] killrog__: i mean this + grounding totem sounds sooo op
[4:00:01] JavaSkrpt: Ah, I see what you mean.
[4:00:04] Kiroxx: from wording it goes when totem is down, isnt it?
[4:00:22] killrog__: i think its gonna be llike the slow totem, at the moment you drop the totem you get the buff for 10 sec and if someone stomp the totem you still have the buff
[4:00:26] killrog__: but you can get purged
[4:00:35] killrog__: that would make more sense
[4:00:38] lethalkingr: @hydramist are you doin a new tier list now that we know the runes?
[4:01:13] Mystiggo: imo the wording would be "totem also grants immunity to the target" without the 10 second bit if it was tied to the totem
[4:01:16] screwu666: no
[4:01:19] screwu666: it is dog
[4:01:19] Distorpia: its kinda weaksauce
[4:01:25] screwu666: it's the retail thing
[4:01:27] cunderthuntz_: pve rune
[4:01:27] screwu666: u cannot even see it
[4:01:30] screwu666: only on the meter
[4:01:44] Kiroxx: beacon from wish
[4:01:45] Kiroxx: :D
[4:01:55] Trekanten: Shamans don't have any good saves, might be good
[4:02:08] Distorpia: don't have enough crit chance anyway
[4:02:13] Distorpia: even with the resto talents
[4:02:22] fcdruidman: we thinking shadow for disc for open world pvp next phase?
[4:02:53] Distorpia: resto won't even be a thing coz enh with maelstrom is the new offhealer with insta chain heals
[4:02:57] Distorpia: spell hance*
[4:03:08] futurafree_: shamans getting nutters while we got defensives to stay alive a bit longer while getting zerged
[4:03:15] killrog__: i feel like enhance is literally gonna be spell hance
[4:03:20] killrog__: it kinda sucks
[4:03:21] killrog__: ngl
[4:03:41] Mystiggo: Blizzard is doing the whole "give alliance shaman things and horde paladin things". Decoy Totem gives blessing of freedom so I bet it'll be a magic buff
[4:03:47] perseay797: Ele - S, Enh -A+, Resto - B . Makes total sense to me.
[4:03:58] Hugo__93: you get chain heal though
[4:04:13] Trekanten: They for sure are getting riptide or something alike
[4:04:18] Trekanten: those arn't all the runes
[4:04:23] screwu666: yep, gief riptide
[4:04:49] Kiroxx: is it just RP text, that awakening got that "aid you" stuff in that, or does that mean, that this will spawn a pet and will heal AFTER the instant?
[4:04:55] screwu666: just put a 3 sec cast on sacred shields for those degens
[4:04:59] Kiroxx: english hard sometimes..:D
[4:05:18] Trekanten: I don't htink they will get riptide, I think they will get something alike to it or something alike to a NS healing wave
[4:05:19] Kreynz: pom should have a 1.5 sec cast too
[4:05:30] Kreynz: and haunt
[4:05:47] Kreynz: and starsurge
[4:06:09] perseay797: Stand and cast, get locked for 10 seconds = gg LUL
[4:06:12] Distorpia: @Kreynz starsurge could use a 3.5s cast tbh LUL
[4:06:38] Kiroxx: is it just RP text, that awakening got that "aid you" stuff in that, or does that mean, that this will spawn a pet and will heal AFTER the instant?
[4:07:09] Kreynz: @Distorpia they could have balanced the game by giving haunt, starsurge, pom cast times, and increasing penance to a 2.5 or 3 sec channel
[4:07:18] Distorpia: nothing beats spell power rune tbh, 50% more crit damage? that's the most busted rune i've ever see
[4:07:21] Kreynz: vanilla is meant to be about hardcasting, too many instants in the game now xd
[4:07:29] bcalicore: yeah to proc healing
[4:07:36] bcalicore: its a healing angle
[4:08:08] Distorpia: actually might be an issue with the dot from fire and resetting, since we dont have glyphs to remove dots when sheeped
[4:08:33] bcalicore: i was thinking maybe they would want the ability to just put regen on themselves
[4:08:38] kevnau: Frostfire bolt is basically to feed Brain freeze rune, but you can use Fireball for that as well
[4:08:40] bcalicore: and heal with shatter combo
[4:08:53] prodigy_wow: Frost fire bolt a rogue out of sheep into rune swap perhaps
[4:08:55] Distorpia: to be fair, you only run FF bolt if u go brain freeze, but spell power rune is too strong to warrant anything else in that slot
[4:09:25] Kreynz: i dont believe tht spell power rune is real
[4:09:29] Kreynz: i think it's a fake datamine rune
[4:09:30] prodigy_wow: Frost mage can get 300% crit damage
[4:09:35] prodigy_wow: insane
[4:09:46] Distorpia: imagine later with deep freeze and spamming lances
[4:09:46] prodigy_wow: Imp cone of cold you're entire hp bar
[4:09:51] prodigy_wow: Your*
[4:09:55] Kreynz: giving just +50% crit dmg as a rune is dumb theres no way that rune is real
[4:09:58] Trekanten: difference between a frost mage in wotlk 80 and a mage in 40 in PvP is so close tbh, no way they arn't gonna be blasters in pvP
[4:09:59] alex_976_: it says Frost fire is a 3 secs cast tho, is it even possible to get one off in pvp?
[4:10:00] perseay797: @Prodigy________________ Not like that.250%
[4:10:12] CadaveriTV: i think if your running self heal rune spec maybe…that+living flame self heal when spellfrost instant procs
[4:10:40] ash_p94: living flame self heal is nerfed in p2
[4:10:41] prodigy_wow: It's 150 flat, 100 from frost talent and 50 from rune @cadaveritv :O
[4:11:19] Distorpia: its 250 total
[4:11:21] perseay797: Yeah, 200%
[4:11:25] Distorpia: with the rune
[4:11:30] Toxiferous: correct
[4:11:31] prodigy_wow: Oh I see what you mean
[4:11:32] perseay797: And 50% from rune. So crits will do 250%
[4:11:33] Trekanten: Who knows if it's multiplicative or addative
[4:11:39] Trekanten: might be 150%
[4:11:46] Toxiferous: so it’ll probably be 225% together
[4:11:55] bcalicore: so like frost nova into shatter spellfrost is like a 400 - 600 heal for yourself i thin
[4:12:01] Distorpia: if its a multiplier then 300% but that's unlikely
[4:12:02] prodigy_wow: Always thought it was 100 on top but it could be a 50%
[4:12:17] Distorpia: talents are additive so assuming its the same
[4:12:21] prodigy_wow: Shrug
[4:12:22] Kreynz: i would guess it's additive
[4:12:28] perseay797: If it's not additive, it would be busted.
[4:12:29] Toxiferous: additive
[4:12:31] bcalicore: its probably a hidden aura so its probably additive
[4:12:44] letho_og: 100 lance hit, 250 lance crit
[4:12:58] Distorpia: even 250% its still busted
[4:13:06] Trekanten: I believe multiplicative
[4:13:21] Toxiferous: 225% yea
[4:13:26] Distorpia: it's gonna get nerfed, there's just no way
[4:13:32] Trekanten: The rune must be fire focused, so they will probably make it useless for frost mages.
[4:13:41] prodigy_wow: Yeah okay 225 perhaps
[4:13:56] prodigy_wow: Big ignites
[4:13:59] Toxiferous: stupid classic WoW tooltip wording
[4:14:57] avjdktv: @hydramist who's the best race horde for warlock
[4:15:04] kevnau: Fireball is also instant with Brain Freeze
[4:15:05] Distorpia: it depends if we're talking dps or burst
[4:15:08] perseay797: Stupid ass formula there :D
[4:15:26] dreeeamyy: arent you a mathematician? Kappa
[4:15:27] Kreynz: fireblal rank is 36
[4:15:28] Kreynz: i think
[4:15:31] perseay797: 36.
[4:15:42] Distorpia: frost and fire bolt are very close at 40
[4:15:45] eXTreMe1337: frostfirebolt has higher crit dmg and ignite
[4:15:50] meheheh3h3: and fireball wont benefit from iceshards
[4:15:50] eXTreMe1337: if talented
[4:16:02] Distorpia: FF bolt being a rune too so default 40 scaling
[4:16:12] avjdktv: @hydramist who's the best race horde for warlock
[4:16:18] eXTreMe1337: +10%critdmg from frost talent +40%dmg from ignite
[4:16:22] eXTreMe1337: +100%
[4:16:31] perplexity: 175 raiders from perplexity have joined! 
[4:16:39] zickiwow: hi
[4:16:40] Trekanten: if you're playing frost, you run FFB, fire, you use the crit
[4:16:46] Nizzftw: PERP GANG RISE UP
[4:16:50] CadaveriTV: Instant cast is clutch too…no chance of spellock, use on move etc.
[4:16:54] LoopeRtronn: HeyGuys
[4:16:54] daLuhz: rune hype
[4:16:55] HeyImArty: Good evening Ryan how are we today hydraLove
[4:17:05] Superduck865: rank 1 FB spam inc for brain freeze proc ?
[4:17:06] Distorpia: a well timed frostbolt +icelance shatter is probably more effective burst than random FFbolt rng proc, even if the latter is higher dps i'd assume
[4:17:09] Peplawl: dooming
[4:17:14] d1vbno: crying
[4:17:15] zickiwow: losing wsgs on era
[4:17:28] Nizzftw: dont ask xD
[4:17:28] simplyshredded22: are you not disregarding the damage bonus lance would get from the crit rune
[4:17:40] unrealsiv: Perp unhappy he'll never beat you in a duel again
[4:17:53] Gallowxyz: Priest is 25, time to get my 750 hp ass blasted in WSG
[4:18:00] Distorpia: icelance crits on frozen targets do about the same damage as frost bolt
[4:18:19] Distorpia: higher actually coz its scaled to 40
[4:18:47] tiggilove: Prob just cast frostfire bolt. Instead of frostbolt? Am I wrong?
[4:18:49] eXTreMe1337: all those new bolts are prob making hybrid builds viable
[4:18:50] simplyshredded22: yeh lance is a rune so scales well
[4:18:55] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[4:18:56] Trekanten: you don't have to use the FFB for BF, you can use a normal FB
[4:19:06] Trekanten: Might be more value with the 50% but big doubt, idk
[4:19:10] Toxiferous: or maybe it will be TBC nova Kappa
[4:19:18] Distorpia: FF bolt prolly better for 1v1s where u cant turret
[4:19:20] Trekanten: The FFB can proc lance procs
[4:19:28] simplyshredded22: idk I think maybe 1v1 you take ffb and team fighting the crit rune better
[4:19:39] Fropsy: but if u go with Missile Barrage , u can cast insta fireball and treiiger barrage
[4:19:51] maksneshutit: is Druid already rated ?
[4:19:59] pancakesatmondays: I just married my sisters mom, Im so happy right now! everyone told me I was gay, but I proved em wrong
[4:20:27] ellisyo: !runes
[4:20:27] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[4:20:45] Distorpia: whichever way we spin it frost is gonna be strong af
[4:21:06] bcalicore: i pumped the formula into a calc and at 40 it does 220 - 2555 dmg frostfirebolt
[4:21:13] bcalicore: 255*
[4:21:23] Distorpia: im on team crit damage
[4:21:24] cryptomeganinja: hey hydra, is there a way to study your list? missed the beginning. cheers
[4:21:24] Distorpia: :p
[4:21:45] Distorpia: can get frostbite procs from r1 novas to shatter too
[4:21:52] Distorpia: r1 frostbolts *
[4:22:01] bcalicore: you are gonna have to surprise burst someone to kill them anyway with pally healers LOL
[4:22:11] HeyImArty: hydraKit
[4:22:12] perseay797: Nunu? :O
[4:22:36] Distorpia: double iceblock, barrier and veins? xD
[4:22:56] tiggilove: A plus
[4:23:24] Toxiferous: Veins doesn’t affect instants tho
[4:23:53] Distorpia: yeah but last phase mages had none of their shatter mechanics, none of their defensives + they're getting displacement further pushing their supremacy vs melee
[4:23:56] bcalicore: eww i just did mind spike and its like 110-125 base on 40 -- i guess it gets lots of +shadow talents
[4:24:09] wowjunkie94: Do you think Shadow will oneshot folks in phase 2
[4:24:14] KrazyStep: mages gonna stay sheep/slow bots, im more scared of pala locks and hunters more p2
[4:24:25] Petrkin: just play frostfire spec with hotstreak and fingers gg op af
[4:24:56] bcalicore: have to cast 3 to get through 1 sacred shield lol
[4:25:15] Distorpia: bet 100g the op mage spec will come out of left field with some janky random healing rune combination pushing it into S+
[4:25:25] futurafree_: we doomin or vibing for 40?
[4:25:26] wowjunkie94: Everyone in sarthe chat is saying Shadow is op and will just oneshot lol
[4:26:03] Distorpia: wait more 42 yard spells ?
[4:26:06] Distorpia: sigh
[4:26:27] KrazyStep: @Petrkin i thought Frostfire and streak were on the same rune slot
[4:26:51] Distorpia: hot streak 100%
[4:26:52] Petrkin: @krazystep frostfire spec not rune
[4:26:53] HeyImArty: Just finished your latest video, man is tilted at the pally crit stuff hydraKit
[4:26:55] bcalicore: hot streak
[4:27:02] nadeiss: hot streak for sure
[4:27:10] vrsswow: Bro did you change (PC setup) position its a new background ?
[4:27:10] Petrkin: hot streak fingers
[4:27:11] hoibi_wasmachensachen: we need more crit for hotstreak i think
[4:27:13] kevnau: Probably, could see a Scorch spam hot streak build working
[4:27:14] perseay797: Hot Streak is cool but it's cheeky to land 2 crits in a row with these low crit chances
[4:27:23] bcalicore: there is a 15% crit rune
[4:27:26] Distorpia: crit damage
[4:27:26] CadaveriTV: crit and hot streak?
[4:27:28] Toxiferous: bigger ignites Kreygasm
[4:27:35] mopchild: cant wait for boomkin next phase
[4:27:40] mopchild: shame all the gear looks DOGSHITTT
[4:27:40] Petrkin: frostfire spec is gonna be most broken shit ever with deepfreeze
[4:27:42] Distorpia: for damage its S
[4:27:42] bcalicore: A+
[4:27:42] perseay797: A
[4:27:44] nadeiss: s
[4:27:45] tpleym: A
[4:27:48] scarawr: with deep freeze it's S
[4:27:50] Distorpia: but fire is squishy afff
[4:27:54] hoibi_wasmachensachen: lvl 40 probably like a or b -- the more crit we get it can get s soon
[4:28:00] perseay797: Without combustion will be difficult to proc it
[4:28:05] ash_p94: crit chance not high enough for S in this phase
[4:28:20] Toxiferous: combust into hot streak proc
[4:28:20] Distorpia: what r u guys smoking
[4:28:22] Distorpia: burnout ye
[4:28:27] Petrkin: just setup with fingers its better
[4:28:28] CadaveriTV: mages also have a 20% crit rune from p1
[4:28:32] TheZtiff: If fire had gotten dragosn breath would be awsome
[4:28:35] KrazyStep: @Petrkin when u say frostfire spec do u mean an elemental spec? points in both fire/frost?
[4:28:36] Distorpia: burnout + 6% from fire tree
[4:28:37] perseay797: 25%
[4:28:45] bcalicore: burnout 6% fire tree and like all the itmes have crit on the
[4:28:46] mopchild: scorch every time
[4:28:49] scarawr: spam scorch
[4:28:51] Distorpia: scorch 100%
[4:28:51] Petrkin: Ye elemental spec
[4:28:51] tiggilove: Yes
[4:28:52] scarawr: new scorch rank at 40
[4:28:56] CadaveriTV: burnout rune from p1 gives a shit ton of crit so it will prob alot
[4:28:57] perseay797: Proccing 25% twice in the row is 12.5%. That's the chance to get hot streak
[4:29:03] hoibi_wasmachensachen: scorch could be the way
[4:29:09] nadeiss: Fire mage will sit around 30% ++ crit chance
[4:29:12] kevnau: Scorch also gets 4% ekstra crit from talents
[4:29:14] Distorpia: crit chance on fblast
[4:29:16] perseay797: Dump range
[4:29:28] Distorpia: crit on fireblast
[4:29:32] mopchild: imp scorch
[4:29:34] mopchild: for sure
[4:29:35] scarawr: i would stop at pyro personally
[4:29:36] Distorpia: u want all the crit talents
[4:29:40] Petrkin: Yes go shatter
[4:29:43] bcalicore: blast wave and combust
[4:29:48] hoibi_wasmachensachen: critical mass is kinda nice
[4:29:50] bcalicore: combust guarantees crit pretty much
[4:29:57] Distorpia: below ignite
[4:30:26] Petrkin: you also get instant firebolt with brainfreeze
[4:30:38] Petrkin: so just rank one frostbolt
[4:30:50] Petrkin: and get fingers and brainfreeze
[4:30:53] Toxiferous: imp frost bolt is always nice for the slow
[4:30:55] ash_p94: Pyroblast is lvl 36 spell as well, so a bit weak
[4:31:05] mopchild: r1 frost bolt for frostbite procs
[4:31:15] Distorpia: you can get shatter + pyro blast at best
[4:31:28] scarawr: you're choosing between pyro and iceblock pretty much
[4:31:30] Toxiferous: permafrost
[4:31:48] mopchild: perma is op
[4:32:06] Petrkin: for bgs its insane
[4:32:14] mopchild: nova scorch scorch and if youre lucky it hasnt broken then high crit chance insta pyro
[4:32:22] tiggilove: Fingers of frost works with fire if u have the proc
[4:32:39] bcalicore: what level pyro do we even get
[4:32:49] lev4o0: why exactly would you not be able to engrave a helmet with deep freeze at 40?
[4:32:54] wrodara94: priest in p2 holy or disco ?
[4:32:54] mopchild: burnout is cracked for this
[4:33:13] unrealsiv: fingers proc rate terrible on sod
[4:33:21] Petrkin: its about the setup with fingers
[4:33:27] Distorpia: all of this just to proc hot streak once , 0 defensives and survivability gonna get 1 shot by a random bestial pet
[4:33:32] Distorpia: xd
[4:33:37] nadeiss: tbh i think it will be more worth going deep in fire instead of a elemental spec at 40
[4:33:40] haansi1337: Have you done Druid yet?
[4:33:52] unrealsiv: 40 points in frost
[4:33:53] sfapkoqwsda: Your ice lance benefits from the fingers so as deep freeze and they don't benefit from burnout
[4:33:54] unrealsiv: for barrier
[4:33:56] unrealsiv: must
[4:33:59] perseay797: Forced as fuck
[4:34:00] scarawr: agreed
[4:34:12] bcalicore: get the stun with molten armor too right
[4:34:23] perseay797: Dump spell range
[4:34:48] perseay797: Yeah that's what i'll do
[4:35:52] Petrkin: ignite is the crit modif
[4:35:52] TheZtiff: rank on pyro lvl 40?
[4:35:57] Distorpia: still paper spec though, damage will be good and aoe cleave in bgs will be insane
[4:36:00] perseay797: Hot Streak will probably shine next phases, rn your crit chance is just too low
[4:36:08] lev4o0: the problem with ice lance is that it hits like a wet noodle so i doubt it will be good to press at all
[4:36:16] Distorpia: if you go hot streak you get no regen so can't even heal with living flame
[4:36:39] TheZtiff: is pompyro a thing this phase?
[4:36:45] scarawr: if you want more control, you could sacrifice damage for imp frostbolt and use brain freeze
[4:36:47] scarawr: for the r1 spams
[4:36:47] Toxiferous: fire mage just flops over to pressure
[4:36:49] Distorpia: sry i meant burnout
[4:36:52] Distorpia: not hot streak
[4:36:58] perseay797: I ran BFD with my bis fire mage just now, i get 10-15% crit on my fireballs even though i run burnout. The crit is just too unreliable.
[4:36:58] bcalicore: @TheZtiff no its one or the other
[4:37:16] Distorpia: but less crit is less hot streak procs which at that point is basically asking myself why im even fire xD
[4:37:20] Skipiz852: have u done 20 quest to turn in instant ?
[4:37:32] Petrkin: thats why you need fingers at 40 to set it up
[4:37:57] perseay797: Yeah you don't get good amount of crits on fire your dps is fucked.
[4:38:19] CadaveriTV: B tier maybe even
[4:38:48] addiox2: Frost more kiting
[4:39:01] mopchild: i feel its for a nice little pvp montage more than actual gameplay
[4:39:10] Distorpia: to be fair arcane is where the gimmicky one shots are xD
[4:39:20] perseay797: For pvp - yes. For pve i think fire will still be the strongest.
[4:39:20] prodigy_wow: I'm BGS, free pyros after you spread living bombs
[4:39:25] prodigy_wow: That's going to own
[4:39:46] perseay797: Although missle barrage is suuuper good.
[4:39:46] Kyfoon: conor bradley goal EZ
[4:39:47] Distorpia: probably burnout with spell power rune for extra crit damage
[4:40:06] unrealsiv: haha
[4:40:26] hoaxxes: Use trinket :3
[4:40:27] Petrkin: dispersion gg
[4:40:29] life_waste: poly blast re-poly to get max stacks
[4:40:29] Toxiferous: back to brill
[4:40:35] daLuhz: nuclear launch detected
[4:40:38] GameOverz: glad i get to fight that :)
[4:40:39] lev4o0: ya kill 1 and then bite the dust for the next 3 minutes
[4:40:40] hoaxxes: new trinket removes all effects btw
[4:40:42] perseay797: I crit with arcane surge for 1k at 25 :) And then i'm oom
[4:40:43] Superduck865: shaman can easily handle that
[4:40:44] unrealsiv: disperion ez
[4:40:49] unrealsiv: or ps
[4:40:53] prodigy_wow: They have to adjust arcane surge
[4:40:55] eXTreMe1337: if they're not dead than u'll have a problem bc u have to wait for the first mana regen tick to be able to do a fireblast (prob better to do the FB before surge)
[4:40:55] unrealsiv: dispersion
[4:41:00] gia__: you just pop spirit of the redeemer
[4:41:10] Petrkin: dispersion and his whole burst is fcked
[4:41:36] eXTreMe1337: RNG gods are not with me
[4:41:36] unrealsiv: arcane surge will restore like 20% mana to finish em off
[4:41:39] GameOverz: @Hydramist im late to the party...but how are you feeling about Spriest runes? more of a let down? and do you think they come down in the tier rank
[4:41:43] Superduck865: also mana gem btw
[4:41:49] prodigy_wow: @petrkin they still have the control, you'll have to press it before or else you're doomed
[4:41:58] jaeger4kd: GROUNDING TOTEM
[4:41:58] tiggilove: Would epic helm work with arcane surge?
[4:42:03] prodigy_wow: But I guess you press it during the blanket
[4:42:09] prodigy_wow: And prayge
[4:42:09] jarlo123: Felhunter dispel sheep
[4:42:15] bcalicore: sacred shield!
[4:42:18] jarlo123: Felhunter kick
[4:42:21] jarlo123: Np
[4:42:31] perseay797: Locks EZ
[4:42:33] fafoo204: rogues are gna shit on mages at 40 I feel like
[4:42:36] prodigy_wow: Not too hard to play around disperce
[4:42:36] Distorpia: surge will still one shot non soul link though
[4:42:36] unrealsiv: locks don't even have coil yet and still OP
[4:42:53] sfapkoqwsda: and druids can't be sheeped
[4:42:55] perseay797: I won the class selection game (i'm playing lock) EZ
[4:42:57] sfapkoqwsda: can outrange mage casts
[4:43:01] futurafree_: we need more cc
[4:43:03] futurafree_: a kick
[4:43:11] marre_88: lel
[4:43:13] Waterwalk: Actually, I won, since I play 5x hunter multbox in world pvp and i face roll everything :P
[4:43:13] theEntropie: gg
[4:43:14] Petrkin: rogue gonna shit on arcane
[4:43:14] unrealsiv: the arcane dream is meme
[4:43:16] Distorpia: locks aren't op guys, ill just casually spellstone the silences
[4:43:25] felstavd: Ithink prot warr will own in PVP p2
[4:43:31] fafoo204: arcane will be great whenever AP is up :D
[4:43:35] scarawr: it will be good against shadow priests with regen rune
[4:43:48] Distorpia: arcane concentration mandatory talent
[4:43:49] scarawr: imp cs as well
[4:44:01] TheZtiff: clearcast
[4:44:06] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[4:44:13] theEntropie: Arcane will be OP because while you peasants are leveling, they will be aoe farming Gnomeregan solo
[4:44:23] perseay797: Let's go
[4:44:31] unrealsiv: it will be crazy dam for sure
[4:44:36] unrealsiv: if people let them stand and cast
[4:44:37] Distorpia: still squishy without regen
[4:44:53] holymio: can you show the whole google sheet, colum E-G is without data, just move it to right
[4:44:58] perseay797: It will be a good dam - that's it :D
[4:44:59] Petrkin: arcane is meme go next
[4:45:06] Toxiferous: arcane barrage wen?
[4:45:25] unrealsiv: spell power
[4:45:26] unrealsiv: for sure
[4:45:37] perseay797: Barrage is S, come on
[4:45:42] Distorpia: have you noticed mage is getting ALL the bolt spells ?
[4:45:47] perseay797: Yeah
[4:45:50] Distorpia: got like 5 new bolt runes
[4:45:52] perseay797: Healer mage  = A
[4:45:53] sfapkoqwsda: Maybe hybrid mages are the meta
[4:46:02] theEntropie: How many bolts do we give mages,  YES
[4:46:50] Superduck865: probably will work like the touch of the magi on retail
[4:46:59] Superduck865: i think
[4:47:00] unrealsiv: no idea lol
[4:47:03] Petrkin: its pve
[4:47:04] drishx: 43% base mana KEKW
[4:47:10] Distorpia: i have no idea what blizz is planning with the healing spec tbh
[4:47:17] hoibi_wasmachensachen: sounds like the cast is giving a buff and the recast is exploding the buff
[4:47:17] alex_976_: so if we interrupt this mages get locked out of all their spells?
[4:47:17] fafoo204: right lol
[4:47:18] marre_88: sounds like the release is insta
[4:47:19] unrealsiv: terrible lol
[4:47:23] Distorpia: its like random stuff thrown on the wall
[4:47:30] prodigy_wow: I'm back to wondering if cs'ing this will lock them on all three schools
[4:48:02] zaanoy: !playlist
[4:48:04] Zelimeth: arcane surge into chron pres?
[4:48:15] Distorpia: looks like C for crap tier
[4:48:46] VitorMartino: !runes
[4:48:46] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[4:48:46] eXTreMe1337: mage healer looks more like a pve healer where u can predict the incoming damage
[4:48:50] vrsswow: Bro did you check loot new items - legit there is no spellpower weapon for casters only off hand (if iam not mistaken)
[4:48:59] Distorpia: resto sham prolly higher tier than mage tbh
[4:49:00] screwu666: no need to hate resto shaman
[4:49:02] scarawr: did you go over rogue yet?
[4:49:06] Distorpia: got mana tide + NS
[4:49:30] Toxiferous: B tier is generous
[4:49:34] theEntropie: Resto at least gets chain heal
[4:49:36] Distorpia: B-
[4:49:44] unrealsiv: healer mage is pretty trash
[4:49:45] Petrkin: you still have Blink and poly as healer mage
[4:49:47] theEntropie: B-
[4:49:49] unrealsiv: having to cast arcane to heal
[4:49:50] unrealsiv: meh
[4:49:55] Distorpia: healer mage prolly the worst spec in the game
[4:50:00] unrealsiv: carried by living flame
[4:50:03] perseay797: Frost S for pvp, Fire A+ for pve, Healer is just A for both.
[4:50:03] CadaveriTV: fire and arcane is B i think tbh
[4:50:12] haansi1337: @vrsswow There is the dagger?
[4:50:15] screwu666: do these shits really need those buffs?
[4:50:37] Distorpia: can u imagine picking rebuke over being a walking tremor totem ?
[4:50:46] Kyfoon: yes
[4:50:47] lastad94: can someone gift me a sub pls
[4:50:48] perseay797: Pog they did
[4:50:54] eXTreMe1337: resto shaman is still funny with ancestral guidance in 1v1, just heal yourself with big overload crit heals without big spellpushbacks and see how your flameshock target dies of ancestral guidance dmg :D
[4:50:56] Noitheknight333: yeah they changed a few things
[4:50:56] hoibi_wasmachensachen: they change it today like 2 hrs ago
[4:50:57] vrsswow: IT WAS 2,7
[4:51:04] theEntropie: Hydrostaff is bis
[4:51:05] TheBarehand: They said the stats weren't confirmed
[4:51:08] Noitheknight333: theres a dagger they changed to epic

[4:51:58] vrsswow: Dagger is monka compare to other weapons
[4:52:05] playerpersonx: BFD weps were a bit too good. if they did as big of a leap in Gnomeregan we would end up with TBC level weps at 60
[4:52:09] ezpz_viscous: they changed the debuff on the fist weapon from 5 min to 20 sec too lol
[4:52:11] vrsswow: 7 sp more then one from BFD
[4:52:14] boris1893: boris1893 subscribed with Prime. 
[4:52:24] unrealsiv: thank demo locks for that
[4:52:25] unrealsiv: rofl
[4:52:34] drishx: I feel like they can't buff the spell power much more before they start overtaking things from MC KEKW
[4:52:38] futurafree_: it’s sucks that BFD staff is still poggers. back to grinding
[4:52:46] unrealsiv: healer mage staff for sure
[4:52:53] vrsswow: look at melee weapons they have like 20+ stats on it

[4:53:47] Distorpia: i'd stick to LW due to P3 having improved specializations
[4:53:48] Sinostra: @vrsswow only if you're mage
[4:53:54] Kyfoon: @Kavsen nah, LW and engi

[4:55:20] fafoo204: I thought so too
[4:55:21] perseay797: Yeah they changed it
[4:55:22] Plushie__Tv: im sure it was just the spell reduction cost?
[4:55:26] Plushie__Tv: could be wrong ofc
[4:55:27] Kyfoon: @Kavsen leather prices are ridic now
[4:55:30] screwu666: hahaha enjoy your dispersion
[4:55:34] screwu666: without damage
[4:55:36] TheBarehand: it was just the cost

[4:55:38] theEntropie: Wait, engineering gives epic waist =O
[4:55:40] perseay797: Nerfed before arrival KEKW

[4:56:34] reazer93: what about the plate helms?any good?
[4:56:47] nessll: Nature dmg is for the raid
[4:56:49] Kyfoon: @TheBarehand yeah I'm struggling with this for my boomie
[4:57:07] Exusprime: As a pve hero i want engi on pally and warrior for that shield
[4:57:20] perseay797: A boomie is pumping me? 😳
[4:57:48] cryptomeganinja: can i see ret for a sec please :)
[4:57:49] perseay797: Why'd you want faster wand?
[4:58:09] TheBarehand: @Kyfoon im thinking leather one since as boomy we spend a lot of time kiting
[4:58:17] perseay797: I see
[4:58:46] duxmusic: what about bookins, I think tailoring will be far superior. leathework helms doesnt seem good
[4:58:47] Kyfoon: @TheBarehand i was also leanin more towards leather but ye not sure
[4:59:05] Distorpia: it's garbage outside of pve
[4:59:09] Distorpia: or with felguard
[4:59:22] Distorpia: u need the pet to proc it so the lock gets it
[4:59:25] Sinostra: basically, yeah
[4:59:26] perseay797: Yes. Jerk each other off KEKW
[4:59:27] hoibi_wasmachensachen: is this like warlocks focus magic? XD
[4:59:35] Kyfoon: they are bringing out a sleeping bag for experience buff in phase 2
[4:59:42] Kyfoon: KEKW
[4:59:52] Distorpia: me being a lock main T_T
[4:59:57] Sinostra: invocation isn't that good
[5:00:05] Exodyqq: !talents
[5:00:06] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[5:00:07] Sinostra: i'd say we go synergy
[5:00:19] Distorpia: shadow flame with haunt is gonna be a very strong dot
[5:00:31] dragosbucurt: but shadowflame can be used to proc conflag
[5:00:36] dragosbucurt: for 30% haste
[5:00:43] Sinostra: depends on shadowflame's damage
[5:00:46] Toxiferous: doodoo p2 affli runes
[5:00:51] jess1ng: whats ur thoughts on priests p2 @Hydramist
[5:00:55] Plushie__Tv: has this been mentioned yet? https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1752798915743600746
[5:00:55] Distorpia: its shadow too, so u get all the multipliers
[5:00:55] vrsswow: Tailoring 1-150 cost 5g + 10g if u wana epic boots and Engi cost 12-15g
[5:01:05] Distorpia: 10% from aff , 20% from haunt
[5:01:14] dragosbucurt: the key there is proc conflag with it
[5:01:18] Distorpia: wait the dot is fire?
[5:01:20] Distorpia: trash tier
[5:01:24] Sinostra: dot is fire, yeah
[5:01:26] vrsswow: i just finished lvling up Tailoring + Engi
[5:01:33] Sinostra: it's more of a destro spell
[5:01:34] theEntropie: You spell reflect shadow weaving from SP and get another 15% buff on dots as warlock
[5:01:39] Sinostra: but can still be used as affli
[5:01:40] Distorpia: dknowledge it is
[5:01:53] Distorpia: shoudl be roughly about 30 sp ~ gain without demo tree or the new trinket
[5:01:53] poistay: what runes would you go as a disc priest
[5:02:16] Distorpia: 30 sp is basically an extra item piece
[5:02:22] Sinostra: add grimoire of synergy to the list
[5:02:32] hoibi_wasmachensachen: demonic knowledge is gonna be a i think
[5:02:39] Sinostra: it might be ever better than invocation
[5:02:55] Distorpia: u can get a lot more if u go into demo and pick up the pet stamina talents + the new bfd trinket gives 20 stam/80 int for pet which is about an extra 10-12 sp on top
[5:02:58] Sinostra: invocation has negative synergy with everlasting affliction
[5:03:00] ripinpeace10: @Hydramist runes this next phase ebsides pain supp seems o boring for most classes
[5:03:01] Distorpia: so demo with trinket is abou 50 sp
[5:03:09] Sinostra: and might also have with CoA
[5:03:34] moarpwp: affli gets dark pack as talent too dont forget this op spell
[5:03:34] Distorpia: lock runes are very lackluster ngl
[5:03:45] unrealsiv: locks already so strong though
[5:04:01] Distorpia: u guys are basically gonna push us into soul link
[5:04:07] Distorpia: coz we got nothing good going for us
[5:04:07] Kyfoon: weaker phase, still A KEKW
[5:04:10] Sinostra: yeah affli gets from S to A
[5:04:15] Sinostra: not much else to say
[5:04:16] Exusprime: Lock runes are lack luster because Soul Link still exists
[5:04:28] debug23: priest stuff good or no ??
[5:04:31] Sinostra: i think i'm going grimoire + demonic knowledge
[5:04:34] plowgod: anyone else watching from the toilet rn
[5:04:42] Distorpia: unless you one shot them
[5:04:44] Plushie__Tv: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/new-experience-item-for-phase-2-season-of-discovery-337482 sleeping bag for exp buff, I wonder if it will be any good or where its from :D
[5:04:55] hoibi_wasmachensachen: thats why demonic knowledge is good it just flat more sp
[5:05:00] Distorpia: dont forget the mortal strikes and wounds coming to counter lock healing ^^
[5:05:03] Sinostra: don't forget other classes get huge dps boosts
[5:05:09] causemosmvp: Thats so good man
[5:05:10] Sinostra: drain life can't do everything
[5:05:17] Sinostra: also it's affected by MS
[5:05:19] causemosmvp: Rested xp
[5:05:20] scroteyx: 30sp vs an actual useful ability
[5:05:28] nessll: $$$
[5:05:30] Plushie__Tv: i want to know :D
[5:05:32] Distorpia: healing reduction's gonna fuck afflocks a lot
[5:05:33] hoaxxes: KEK HOMELESS COW
[5:05:34] causemosmvp: New survival profession
[5:05:35] Exusprime: lols
[5:05:45] causemosmvp: it was like this on turtle wow
[5:05:45] Kyfoon: camping in eastern plaguelands for 24 hours
[5:05:53] hiraethonhs: u have to buy sub for a year to get it
[5:06:02] felstavd: they had to figure something out after the ban GDKP. So now you can buy a sleeping bag from  blizzard @Hydramist
[5:06:18] Toxiferous: all this time, our characters have been sleeping without sleeping bags
[5:06:25] Kavsen: Whenever I see an SL lock ill just ghost  wolf and run away tbh
[5:06:28] Distorpia: SL no corruption , agony isn't enough damage by itself, but i guess going meta for insta searing with incinerate onpants
[5:06:29] Kavsen: f that shit
[5:06:43] Sinostra: yeah SL is tanky, but that's about it
[5:06:46] unrealsiv: SL at 40 meh
[5:06:48] Distorpia: so i guess incinerate to buff searing + immolate kinda weaksauce damage wise
[5:06:56] hoibi_wasmachensachen: immolate aura do be bussin
[5:07:08] Sinostra: and imagine meta can be banned
[5:07:08] Distorpia: there's no way meta is beating priest , no sustain without haunt to counter dispels
[5:07:23] hoibi_wasmachensachen: oh aura is bracers dang
[5:07:29] plowgod: can’t wait to purge spam all these casters
[5:07:37] Distorpia: locks come back phase 3
[5:07:38] ripinpeace10: @Hydramist what other rpiest runes have been datamined?
[5:07:47] bcalicore: i think nightfall with covered drain life and corruption is gonna be enough LOL
[5:07:48] Sinostra: also locks get coil in P3
[5:07:58] Sinostra: we're gonna have to be patient boys
[5:08:01] Distorpia: phase 3 soul link with corruption UA
[5:08:04] Exusprime: phase 2 locks are on time out
[5:08:06] Distorpia: gonna be hilarious
[5:08:08] XpirimintZ: @ripinpeace10 https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/season-of-discovery-phase-2-datamined-runes-wow-classic-337457
[5:08:21] Petrkin: meta + ruin build and insta corupt
[5:08:29] Distorpia: best case phase 2 is probably full destro with meta vs melee
[5:08:46] Distorpia: but still 2.5 casts without haste is gonna suck
[5:08:48] Sinostra: destro goes shadow and flame
[5:08:48] Distorpia: but seduce is here
[5:08:53] TheBarehand: u get seduction at least, but still no death coil
[5:08:53] lastad94: 3min ads every 5 min man .....
[5:09:17] ripinpeace10: @Hydramist spirit of the redeemer seems cool
[5:09:22] Distorpia: destro damage is high but not as bursty as ele, too much hardcasting too this phase
[5:09:44] Petrkin: meta searing spam
[5:09:53] scroteyx: only 3 in the slow one
[5:10:03] Distorpia: ditch the daze
[5:10:08] Distorpia: locks cant kite gotta turret
[5:10:13] Sinostra: ditch imp searing pain
[5:10:17] Exusprime: drop bane
[5:10:25] varatupaj: you can use daze now with meta
[5:10:28] Exusprime: cant ditch the daze
[5:10:35] Distorpia: wouldn't drop bane tbh
[5:10:36] varatupaj: spam sp for daze
[5:10:43] Distorpia: 10% chance to daze
[5:10:53] Distorpia: how are u gonna kite rogue with sstep with prep
[5:10:56] debug23: Penance + POM nerfs?
[5:10:56] Sinostra: bro, this daze is shit
[5:10:59] Distorpia: or 2x charge warrior ?
[5:11:01] Distorpia: xd
[5:11:08] Sinostra: it's literally blackout but daze instead of stun
[5:11:11] Distorpia: 50%
[5:11:11] scroteyx: 50%
[5:11:13] makkoftw: immolate without bane is kinda ass
[5:11:14] perseay797: would use searing pain outside meta?
[5:11:29] Sinostra: yeah and you need bane for immo
[5:11:34] Distorpia: searing pain crit i'd say
[5:11:38] TheBarehand: im searing pain
[5:11:38] petedelete2019: Hi Hydra, long time no see, Hope u r well! Beard looking good man @Hydramist
[5:12:01] Distorpia: too soon for locks tbh
[5:12:05] Sinostra: as a CB/succubus build, you're not gonna searing pain that often
[5:12:09] shoniewow: hi @Hydramist what uj think about mage?
[5:12:22] Distorpia: druid ?
[5:12:24] Sinostra: add shadow and flame rune for destro
[5:12:30] Toxiferous: 2s corruption so wheelchair
[5:12:31] Distorpia: insta S tier?
[5:12:45] hoaxxes: S-tiers inc :o
[5:12:46] Sinostra: YOU FORGOT SHADOW AND FLAME RUNE FOR DESTRO
[5:12:51] Steggy_730: S tier
[5:12:52] webcamhotty20: i haven't seen new runes...but im hoping ferals are good next phase
[5:12:55] Distorpia: no brainer S tier
[5:12:55] perseay797: Feral S, Boomkin S LUL
[5:13:01] Noitheknight333: Berserk also doesnt mention tiger's fury not being able to be used
[5:13:07] Noitheknight333: which in wotlk it cant be used during
[5:13:11] hiraethonhs: S
[5:13:14] snapLOUD: KEKW
[5:13:17] Distorpia: feral S boomy S resto S , sounds good to me
[5:13:20] shoniewow: @Hydramist what u think about mage so far?
[5:13:23] Noodli_: That sounds broken no?
[5:13:24] Distorpia: LUL
[5:14:05] hoaxxes: prettyyy goooood :D
[5:14:15] Distorpia: feral gonna tear my lock apart, send help
[5:14:28] Noitheknight333: Tigers fury has to be used prior to berserk in wotlk but there isnt a mention of it here in SoD (in the berserk tooltip. Could be kinda massive for a bigger burst window)
[5:14:37] thelordoftheweebs: Thank the lord i chose feral main of balance on my druid
[5:14:38] perseay797: Feral gonna riiiip everything
[5:14:40] Sinostra: @Distorpia maybe not, you  drain
[5:14:44] hoaxxes: let it rip
[5:14:46] thelordoftheweebs: instead of'
[5:14:58] Distorpia: @Sinostra we vibin mate
[5:15:26] falkon222: how was ele/enh ranked?
[5:15:36] TheBarehand: unless that works with starsurge
[5:15:41] Distorpia: starsurge's tooltip states it benefits from all effects wrath and starfire get, if eclipse affects starsurge too it's gonna be hilarious
[5:15:48] shoniewow: !sheet
[5:15:48] TheBarehand: ^^
[5:15:55] perseay797: @falkon222 Ele - S, Enha - A
[5:15:58] snapLOUD: no duration though?
[5:16:10] lyrie77: I think you'd rather take nourish on boomkin ngl
[5:16:20] scroteyx: wouldn't that just put you in both eclipses at once though?
[5:16:20] Distorpia: 100% crit chance starsurge hello ?
[5:16:21] mello_drama: most
[5:16:29] hoibi_wasmachensachen: could be hughe
[5:16:32] felstavd: say hello to all the boomer premadesagain
[5:16:34] tpleym: i have 21% crit atm, pluss 12% in talents(when 40)and buffs i have about 33% crit chance for scorch. this will give me a 11% chance for hot streak. and even more with better gear ofc. so its better than the power surge rune if you can spam scorch
[5:16:42] perseay797: If eclipse works on StarSurge it’s bad news
[5:16:48] hiraethonhs: they will jsut write : doesnt proc from eclipse
[5:16:49] Distorpia: lazorchickens coming soon to STV
[5:17:07] hoaxxes: Cam blocking

[5:18:06] CARL_9000: "balance" :D

[5:18:44] TheBarehand: u wouldn't go natural shifter?

[5:19:22] perseay797: @thebarehand not on boomie at 40
[5:19:36] Noitheknight333: I think starsurge range is gonna get nerfed and hopefully not the damage
[5:20:08] TheBarehand: @perseay797 it's basically free travel form for shifting slows and kiting

[5:26:05] bmnjnjk: Most likely in PvP you won't be running around as full Boomy more Restokin
[5:26:11] Sinostra: @nessll just biding our time

[5:30:58] steehzy23: hows hunters looking ?
[5:31:03] Distorpia: not sure feral should be S, it's still incredibly squishy since it has to choose between damage and survivability
[5:31:03] aerodynam1c: @lastad94 dont shoot the messenger im just the prophet

[5:34:36] Distorpia: absorbs 500 damage at lvl 40? that's a huge amount tbh
[5:34:39] Sinostra: yeah but sheath of light forces you to melee as a holy paladin

[5:40:33] plowgod: rogues already have crippling, why do we need 100 slows
[5:40:33] snapLOUD: allows for wound poison/mind numbing
[5:40:48] Charlemagne_66: i think helm and wrist arent going to be in but the belt and boots will

[5:48:05] snapLOUD: does flame shock have dispel protection through anything?
[5:48:07] Noitheknight333: after lavabursting
[5:48:08] dwamatic: its the reason im horde on priest. no shamans
[5:48:08] 64hooks: no, its not that great. you only get  a couple dot ticks to proc it, and its a 5% chance
[5:48:10] Noitheknight333: plus overloads
[5:48:10] nessll: Proc is 1 shot instantly so I would say gamebreaking
[5:48:20] 64hooks: the duration of the dot is really short
[5:48:46] theEntropie: don't worry about shamans, paladins will 1 shot you with 150% holy shock crit
[5:48:50] dwamatic: dwamatic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[5:48:54] moarpwp: @64hooks what if there are more targets to shock
[5:48:54] 64hooks: and you have a CD so you can't really get it up on more than 2-3 targets
[5:49:04] Noitheknight333: like imagine a chain lightning lavaburst into an instant lavaburst and you got overloads on all of them. nobody survives that
[5:49:22] Noodli_: What tier is warr at? :)
[5:49:28] dwamatic: reason to go horde on priest :)

[5:50:26] 64hooks: @moarpwp this is correct
[5:50:33] plowgod: I feel like there's so many S tier we need an S+ tier
[5:50:35] zi0qt: ye
[5:50:45] petedelete2019: Its nuts isnt it?

[5:51:18] scroteyx: perma lust
[5:51:23] petedelete2019: yeah a is good
[5:51:25] Noitheknight333: windfury procs..idk it seems pretty nuts
[5:51:31] exequtegg: + new melee world buffs are attack speed, so they're stacking attack speed now
[5:51:32] screwu666: also the crowd pummeler
[5:51:33] nessll: You allready have alot of att spd going on in phase 2
[5:51:42] plowgod: use manual crowd pummeller + 2h mastery for memes
[5:51:43] Sinostra: @scroteyx when does sham get lust btw ?
[5:51:47] tiggilove: If you went frost and missile barrage and Regen. Would that mage a decent healer for PvP. Spamming r1 frost bolt and missile barrage to heal?
[5:51:56] eXTreMe1337: that 2h weapon with stun from pvp
[5:52:06] dbdoublej: TBC
[5:52:15] notJumu: why 2h when u can get more WF procs with dual wield/stormstrike and better maelstrom procs
[5:52:23] plowgod: we need S+ tier for overall class list @Hydramist
[5:52:25] GameOverz: i cant wait to get bonked to death by a totem :)
[5:52:25] dbdoublej: @Sinostra TBC mate

[6:11:11] HelluvaWrecks: good
[6:11:19] plowgod: dwarf priest will be extra oppressive for rogues
