[0:42:55] ployboi69: OW NotLikeThis
[0:42:59] Ark_Temper: Nothing was set up ahead of time so every time there was a team switch people had to set up their UIs from scratch.
[0:43:04] Indigo___1: There's a new overwatch esports
[0:43:05] Yanzuh: its apparently open for everyone now
[0:43:06] Xirn: overwatch league was a baffling idea, why bother tying them to cities for sports tribalism and then not basing the players in the cities properly NotLikeThis
[0:43:13] Shelana95: Isnt OW dead ?
[0:43:13] LalaBellaLala: Eh, they modeled OW esports on NFL and look how bad that turned out

[0:43:18] Mezegis_Yo: they have reworked it
[0:43:19] AngelL0ls: Thought they took a bunch of money from the Saudi's Shruge
[0:43:21] EarthRester: OW the game is actually doing very well

[0:44:28] EarthRester: Mod devs will need to design for consols tho
[0:44:28] ravenofjudgement: time to remove 50% of the buttons LUL
[0:44:34] bAssackward: @Preachlfw Unreal Tournament on PS3 had mods
[0:44:35] thavleifrim: ff14 is on consoles and people still mod it
[0:44:44] daedri: yeah, they'd need to curate a list i believe.
[0:44:46] cannedexpectations: bethesda also owned by MS has mods for games, so xbox is going to have it prob
[0:44:49] KelticNight: good luck trying to tweak a Weak Aura on the fly on console LUL
