[1:37:55] ElmSpace: @warrenny The 2nd phase is the hardest and it ends when the dragon dies.  The 3rd phase with only the rider is not as much damage coming out.
[1:38:47] PadidinJones: @Towelliee THIS is why Pallys need the leap

[1:47:43] t_train_va: WFH is the best decision I ever made
[1:47:57] sliproach: piced bear to be a bear if i wanted to be in owl or cat form i'd spec balanced or feral and bear needs the mini gun that bear dude has in the russian avangers film

[1:48:14] Kitsunema: the choice should always be there yeah
[1:48:18] Thoreya: rest remote
[1:48:23] tmiguel27: It should be hybrid or at least once in a while go back to office
[1:48:30] Ponickz: haha
[1:48:33] IchigoKisu: I prefer a hybrid type. Going in one or two days a week keeps me from not isolating myddlf
[1:48:34] Thoreya: it is hybrid
[1:48:37] Thoreya: its 3 days aweek
[1:48:43] dimofodi: @Towelliee the problem is, if they give people the choice, those choosing to come in aren't getting what they wanted to come in for, forcing those who don't want to is the only way. They have to pick who they want to be happy and the people up top want people in so that's who they decide to make happy.
[1:48:46] LuiBMHunter: you never done the mailbox quest - tut tut
[1:48:51] WasomeWasTaken: need that mailbox toy
[1:48:58] Fa3r: Makes work a lot better when I can do it in my boxers
[1:49:03] raldrik: WFH is what saved me from having a breakdown from stress. Long day of work plus an hour commute was too much
[1:49:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: One thing to think about is commute time....if an employee is spending that hour or two a day doing more work, that can be a good thing
[1:49:08] CeruleanStar: i work in h ardware so physical presence is necessary :(
[1:49:20] thebakeriscomingforu: I was hybrid from 2016 to 2020 and been wfh since. So much time saved.

[1:49:30] TheGiant99: You can't supervise people if they are at home
[1:49:33] Thoreya: i wonder if riot is gonna go back to office
[1:49:36] Voidheim: @raldrik same
[1:49:44] dimofodi: In all honesty, they likely won't lose much. Everyone said the same thing at my company and there wasn't much churn from it.
[1:49:47] Thoreya: since theyre located so close to blizz
[1:50:11] IchigoKisu: If they’re doing their job why do they need to be supervised? And most remote work has monitoring programs
[1:50:13] TheGiant99: Blizz isn't the only company doing it
[1:50:39] WaverlyP15: Yeah, im literally getting a second degree so my WFH options are greater

[1:50:42] dimofodi: @IchigoKisu To validate the need for the supervisor. It's all a control game.
[1:50:51] WasomeWasTaken: that mid-roll add scared the crap outa me
[1:51:12] HaloS23: I have a job that does not allow me to WFH due repairing actual product but I will say i have noticed some who abuses the WFH opportunity, so i believe its a double edge sword. If it work it works well / if it doesnt... you basically have people stealing from the comany they work for. not saying its happening here but...
[1:51:12] Gingerprimer: @Thoreya from what I know Riot asked their LA based ppl to return to office back in june
[1:51:42] t_train_va: The biggest driver for going back to the office is the lost money on the lease agreements
[1:51:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Blizzard had to catch up with infrastructure with so many people going remote
[1:51:56] TheGiant99: At my company the WFH is abused so bad.
[1:51:56] WaverlyP15: If you can work from home why not, but understand the possibility of coming in and being hybrid
[1:52:01] Incredible_Sausage: it's their livelyhoods
[1:52:04] Thoreya: @Gingerprimer ok so its not just blizz
[1:52:13] Gingerprimer: RIOT stopped WFH back in June for their LA ppl

[1:52:54] dldrzoidberg: keep in mind some team leader in a few companies started to call people once a week.

[1:52:58] Sollice: Morning friends
[1:53:00] dldrzoidberg: this is how it starts
[1:53:01] beerking2323: @kreloril777  they know we are playing WOW all day
[1:53:04] dimofodi: @beerking2323 They initially did an optional RTO for us and then when they saw everything was still empty they forced it.
[1:53:06] warrenny: Work from home was always gonna end
[1:53:14] mi3f: my work did RTO about 6 months ago.  Within a week half my depeartment was sick so they reverted back to WFH
[1:53:19] TheGiant99: Before covid people went to work. After covid shouldn't be any different
[1:53:34] Voidheim: my most hated argument is "You want to be a part of the office family don't you?!" I work for you, you ain't no fucking family.
[1:53:35] Sollice: @warrenny Not for me! I told my company that I wanted to be a perma work from home and they put it in my job description fully remote
[1:53:35] Thoreya: @warrenny meh for some companes
[1:53:39] thebakeriscomingforu: lol, WFH has been around a lot longer than 2020.
[1:53:41] Ch0p_Su3y: they said will be 3 presence days.. but many ppl moved out-of-state for save money on rent and living costs.. now having to move back close to the blizz campus its concerning these
[1:53:48] Thoreya: my company is still wfh
[1:53:49] t_train_va: @TheGiant99 Before cars were invented, people took horses or walked. Times change
[1:53:52] Daarksyde: it's accountability. It's knowing the employees are "working" their 8 hours per day instead of playing wow at the same time as working on it
[1:53:58] HAMMERRAZOR: hey if i could work from home i would
[1:54:01] dldrzoidberg: if the building is not yours or its easily sellable. what about the blizz campus?
[1:54:09] WaverlyP15: do people not realize there were alot of WFH jobs before covid? if anything covid just opened the door more
[1:54:11] JustSalvation: been work from home since 2010 love every second of it lol
[1:54:12] cmitchell042092: The company I work for has done away with their building because we are all wfh now
[1:54:15] dimofodi: @TheGiant99 The reason people went in is because they had a working trusted model and they stuck to it. Once they adapted to a WFH model that was trusted it's fine but they're choosing not to stick with it.
[1:54:16] Voidheim: @Daark11 that depends on the position as well.
[1:54:27] WhiteKnight74648: Good Morning!

[1:54:40] Alepouditsa: yep if my work let me work from home i will be all for it!
[1:54:49] Gingerprimer: Also not sure if BLizzard can sell of their buildings even
[1:55:05] griiffinnn: my job went fully remote. the team meets once a quarter for a strategy meeting to make sure we're meeting goals for the year, then we go out for dinner and drinks

[3:44:51] atsq1: If I do 100 and leave 5 vs if I do 10 and leave 5
[3:44:53] juicefermilk: then you can kick him
[3:44:57] Quikbeard: Cleavers no Leavers. Turbos no Hobos.
[3:44:59] mi3f: just make it like votekick and have a cooldown

[3:45:05] IchigoKisu: Like League of Legends surrender vote
[3:45:07] Amarlian: then you just timeout when they can request
[3:45:09] SpidercowSD: Spam Surrender
[3:45:11] Etzli_GG: MAke it so surrenders can only be used once every "X" amount of minutes or something
[3:45:13] AlphasaurusRexx: that shit will turn into LoL where they surrender at 8 minutes every game and then again every chance they get
[3:45:14] hooliggan: It's really jsut don't be a dick
[3:45:24] Matosere: i mean if the person is looking for a timed key and the key is obviously not gonna be timed i dont think they should be penalized for it.
[3:45:25] jetributions: make it up to leader to put to vote
[3:45:42] Amarlian: @hooliggan That's a lot to ask
[3:45:59] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @largefromage (warning)
[3:45:59] hammack52: i think the simplest thing is that if a key is not completed out of time, the key should not downgrade, that way leavers do not punnish the keyholder
[3:46:01] Bigbharash: vote to disband key, if you just drop before a vote is taken place then that person could only do -2 of that key they left.  ie you leave a 20 you cant do anything higher then an 18 for that day.
[3:46:11] EvoCyberNation: You can send a vote button, "Do you agree to leave this dungeon?"
[3:46:12] juicefermilk: ahh it would work as a ratio instead of a straight number complt/left
[3:46:28] hooliggan: I can honestly say I have never left a group
[3:46:34] Matosere: @hammack52 no there should be a punishment for not timing.
[3:46:36] realiteegaming: yeah no downgrades sounds good
[3:46:36] EvoCyberNation: So if the group agrees, they won't get penalized.  :)
[3:46:41] AlphasaurusRexx: @hammack52 nah thats 100% abuseable to keep trying the same level of the key.
[3:46:47] realiteegaming: that would save alot of frustration
[3:46:49] WaverlyP15: shoiuld be if someon leave before completion then the key gets frozen at that levl not bricked

[3:47:46] WaverlyP15: OOO, person who leaves early gets their key penalized
[3:47:46] Quikbeard: The whole situation is their will always be dog shit players and you can’t do anything about it
[3:47:47] GamingDad77: doesn't the ignore system block their names from yyour search?
[3:47:51] Bigbharash: its just feels odd that blizzard gives you a debuff for leaving a random heroic but not an M+
[3:47:53] peinen: @Wildfan1985 this
[3:47:55] noah16hallmark: saving keys yep
[3:47:59] ElmSpace: then you will get toxic people telling others to leave
[3:48:00] Quikbeard: Like you said. To complicated.
[3:48:02] CEK_kingdom: yep
[3:48:03] hammack52: so what,
[3:48:08] Subbed_No_Ban: Get out don’t deplete my key
[3:48:13] jerseyfive: or just leave it like it is and dont invite DH's
[3:48:15] hammack52: if they never complete it they never get rewards for it
[3:48:17] EvoCyberNation: ok guys... were we go! Attempt 46
[3:48:25] dldrzoidberg: key should not be depleted if you dont make it in time
[3:48:31] CEK_kingdom: its honestly propbably best to just leave the system as is
[3:48:34] Masqerader: I kinda wish they had the diablo 2 keystone system.  Where you just go to the dungeon, click altar with a drop down menu and you select the level of your highest or below
[3:48:34] atsq1: Maybe a
[3:48:36] Matosere: @dreamwalker213 i dont understand what ur saying.
[3:48:38] Frostfury: I had someone leaving a key at the very start just because I won't take an alt that was undergeared in a 15.
[3:48:38] Masqerader: diablo 3
[3:48:40] zulath123: !drop
[3:48:43] JimKappa420: key that player get from vault everyweek should have 3/3 charge in case you fail
[3:48:47] WaverlyP15: like i said the leaver should get the penalty. it would stop it real fast
[3:48:58] Matosere: RIO is what matters to me
[3:49:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: If he didn't fuck around with that boon, he probably would have been fine
[3:49:15] mi3f: storm eater's boon is a fucking trap in M+
[3:49:19] GingerGambit: It’s a great trinket on paper but gets so many people killed

[3:49:31] Mecabeast: stormeaters gotta know when you have 10s of nothing going on

[3:49:46] AzureaFrost: maybe something as simple as if someone leaves an the key hasnt been completed then theres a pop up on everyones screen asking if they were problematic or not. An if they get enough reports they get penalised from playing m+ for a month or something. That way people wont risk it
[3:49:47] LegendFromWoW: If there was an addon that was linked to a database (website) that registered each time someone just ditches a key that'd be a community solution.
[3:49:49] Masqerader: this is why if I pug, i look at dungeons completed over score
[3:49:51] GingerGambit: Same shamy?
[3:49:59] mi3f: no canceling
[3:49:59] convrge: nope3 lkol
[3:50:01] dreamwalker213: @matosere and that’s a selfish way to look at it, not everyone does a key to “time it or else”
[3:50:16] jetributions: I only pop it in raid
[3:50:31] Matosere: @dreamwalker213 if im a leader i want my key timed unless i state otherwise.
[3:50:37] dreamwalker213: @matosere people may be doing it for a certain piece of loot, just for the primal focus, who knows
[3:50:49] IchigoKisu: We all know how well the silencing reports went

[3:51:10] AlphasaurusRexx: @dreamwalker213 yeah you should 100% go into a key expecting to time it unless the leader says otherwise
[3:51:36] Matosere: @dreamwalker213 well those people dont matter its not their key. when ur doing someones key ur obj is to time it.
[3:51:43] LegendFromWoW: that'd be nice
[3:51:56] CEK_kingdom: maybe if you tag a key for completion then you have a vote leave option, then all other keys are just like they are
[3:52:01] IMMproveko: I think there has to be a vote system, liek ready check to 'cancel' the run - and leavers just get minus io
[3:52:12] Wugrok: true

[3:54:54] raldrik: hot ones coming back?
[3:54:55] Matosere: @dreamwalker213 if you pug into a key you should be there to time that leaders key. if u dont think u can time it u shouldnt join plain and simple.

[3:57:43] Tubflow: wow timewalking xp is big
[3:57:51] dreamwalker213: @matosere I mean that’s basically my point, if you don’t think it’ll be timed with the comp/group that’s there then don’t join or leave before it starts. Don’t dip after a wipe and screw people over
[3:57:59] brooklynitetv: @everdread9 Must've been a buhch of dk's

[4:00:45] AlphasaurusRexx: @dreamwalker213 It didnt. They wiped once, the shaman died 3 times and the dk died 2 times. Should the DH have left, no, but it was clear the dungeon was not going to be timed on a 20 with the level of players in that dungeon at the time.

[4:09:13] DunzoCD: @Raxxiety its not terrible, unless you are travelling international you have to take a tram to a separate building
[4:09:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @Sollice they need them because youre always having to run across the airport to make your connecting flight after getting off your plane 15 minutes late
[4:09:15] Sollice: @Mecabeast We would to but they will never have one here lol
