[1:09:19] Ragi_Fz: monkaW those fucking health pool spikes what the
[1:14:54] ramneson: Blizz should tune affixes a bit. There is no way you can compare bursting or sanguine with volcanic or entangling for example
[1:16:35] Ragi_Fz: Is Bolstering still in the game? I member that being a piece of shit affix too
[1:18:27] ChocoboLord: You make me wanna play DK now LUL
[1:18:55] ChocoboLord: You play ver yzoomed in
[1:19:33] Savior_of_Rukh: how can you even see whats going on there? idk ... coming from ff those textures look kinda dogshit not gonna lie xffing
[1:21:45] ChocoboLord: Is blood DK hard to play? I used to play dps dk for a while

[1:22:08] Kithe__: flash bang KEKL
[1:22:19] ramneson: Shruge wow brain idk
[1:22:46] Btide: Yo you played AC?
[1:22:54] Savior_of_Rukh: MMO King Arthars NOCRINGE
[1:22:59] Btide: Darktide is still one of my favorite MMO times
[1:23:11] LucaLeonheart: the biggest turnoff about wow is all the addons, like look at your screen wtf is this
[1:23:47] junghee: @LucaLeonheart You don't have to run them if you don't want to - most wow UIs are far cleaner than Arthar's
[1:23:49] Savior_of_Rukh: Well you can adjust that to your liking @LucaLeonheart FF looks similar from the ui for me
[1:24:01] StreamElements: YO SEND ME GIFTS MAN HAHAHAHA at https://jointhrone.com/arthars
[1:24:19] LucaLeonheart: aren't addons mandatory and you won't be let in to groups if you don't have some?
[1:24:27] ramneson: yeah you can play with the default ui and it's pretty much like ff xiv
[1:24:41] Btide: @LucaLeonheart 100% true
[1:24:51] ramneson: mandatory is relative Hmmge
[1:25:12] LucaLeonheart: idk man from what i've seen and heard addons alone are a barrier to entry, among other things
[1:25:14] junghee: @LucaLeonheart If you're running the highest difficulty, yes - if you're just playing casually, no addons are not needed. Most WoW players are casual
[1:26:21] Savior_of_Rukh: i mean you also dont need act in FF when you do anything other than hardcore content like ultimates
[1:27:09] junghee: Yeah, so both games are similar in this regard
[1:27:35] XiaoLong_Bao: Watch your step!
[1:27:48] LucaLeonheart: Nah, I do savage and ultimate and act isn't really "needed"
[1:27:53] junghee: Like, Arthars intentionally has all the audio alerts for memes, but it's not needed
[1:28:09] LucaLeonheart: You don't need anything other than being ready for the challenge in game and pulling your own weight
[1:28:16] DokiDokiNikki: Act is not needed to clear, it's needed when you're not clearing and you don't know why
[1:28:36] junghee: You technically need an addon in FF to remember your password for login so *shrug*
[1:28:50] DokiDokiNikki: @junghee bruh

[1:44:07] skryah: you got candle + soul volley
[1:44:12] skryah: you can get 2x etch and hate your life
[1:44:59] ramneson: outside with bursting is monkaSHAKE
[1:45:11] skryah: bursting is kinda free
[1:45:23] skryah: it doesn't scale with key level so most healers just passively outheal
[1:45:41] ramneson: yeah they have mass dispel too
[1:45:52] skryah: 9 stacks xff
[1:45:55] MasameC: xffing

[1:46:51] Rygothx: Yikes
[1:46:57] skryah: because once you're max level you're on endgame in literally 3 hours
[1:47:06] ramneson: leveling is kinda free now, gearing is the "hard" part
[1:47:10] MasameC: oh i see so you can skip yourself through
[1:47:11] MasameC: thats nice
[1:47:13] skryah: I've been playing for 5 weeks
[1:47:36] skryah: @MasameC nothing is locked behind MSQ, so you just do the most curren campaign and get given gear relevant enough to get started on anything
[1:47:46] skryah: yes lust thorns guy
[1:48:02] MasameC: i see, thank you
[1:48:11] skryah: you usually pull everything between thorns and pig guy

[1:48:36] skryah: @ramneson you either have mage and/or paladin or you suffer
[1:49:18] skryah: you pull those 3 if you wanna skip witch + captain downstairs @Arthars
[1:49:20] EmElw: you could pull mor ye, maggots and gorgers are the dangerous things for yourgroup
[1:50:46] skryah: does this group have any aoe mitigation
[1:50:53] skryah: druid + hunter is a very squishy comp
[1:52:04] skryah: @Arthars you pull those 3 mobs if you wanna skip witch+captain downstairs
[1:52:25] EmElw: healer abuse wtf
[1:52:27] ramneson: pepeW more fire

[1:54:20] skryah: now you can skip everything after the first pack downstairs @Arthars
[1:54:51] skryah: yep full clear these corridors
[1:55:33] CarrieRoe: o_o
[1:55:43] skryah: these mobs are infinitely easier than the ones downstairs
[1:55:46] skryah: so you take them all
[1:55:48] skryah: and skip downstairs
[1:56:10] ikigami_ikigai: LUL

[1:58:56] lirly__: is that bubble thing on plates a plater mod?,
[1:59:30] skryah: skip everything after this pack
[1:59:30] Rygothx: Are the witch spawns random?  It didn't spawn one back there after the boss?
[1:59:37] skryah: @Rygothx changes each week
[1:59:40] skryah: this week there's no witch there
[2:00:04] skryah: you killed those 3 to skip this witch and captain @Arthars
[2:00:15] skryah: but ye pugs body pull it most of the time
[2:00:17] Rygothx: Ah damn. I use MDT and include them in my route so no wonder if messes up my count
[2:00:36] skryah: xff
[2:00:40] skryah: pugs and body pulling xff
[2:00:50] skryah: time to get etched xff

[2:04:05] skryah: with the poison dot
[2:04:11] skryah: we saw it xff
[2:04:30] skryah: stealth
[2:04:52] skryah: the timer is very lenient so who cares
[2:05:07] skryah: ye pugs aren't reliable until +25
[2:05:31] skryah: and even then you have 3.4k rating players doing questionable things
[2:07:29] ramneson: ugly stats tbh
[2:07:42] skryah: 8% is basically as much as a good trinket
[2:07:54] ramneson: maybe if they are looking for some vers
[2:07:56] skryah: good trinkets for DPS players do like 10-12% of total damage
[2:07:58] skryah: each

[2:08:45] skryah: @Rygothx 3 I think
[2:09:01] skryah: the legendary is mainly a huge ilvl stat stick
[2:09:29] skryah: outside of unholy DK, nobody really runs 2 hander classes in m+
[2:09:52] skryah: EB is free this week
[2:09:54] skryah: trust

[2:10:34] skryah: I am EU Sadge
[2:10:36] skryah: NA is asleep
[2:11:29] skryah: raiderio has an update every day no?
[2:12:24] skryah: YEP and you have to use a certain program for it
[2:12:25] Rygothx: Talking about pugs, is going left at Atal advisable? I know they're casters there and have always gone right when in a pug
[2:12:37] skryah: @Rygothx I wouldn't bother until like 24 or 25
[2:12:47] skryah: the pulls on the left are faster and better, but require good cc and kicks
[2:13:02] skryah: but the timer on AD is so lenient that it's not worth until higher keys when people have brains
[2:13:17] skryah: you need to coordinate burst, cc and kicks
[2:13:30] skryah: there's 3 really dangerous skills that if they go through = wipe
[2:13:35] ÈñíÁæä: HeyGuys
[2:13:37] Rygothx: @skryah That's what I thought.  Def looks faster but like you said, requires coordinated cc/kicks
[2:13:50] skryah: and you need a way to deal with juggernauts
[2:13:57] skryah: either someone ranged who knows how to bait
[2:14:04] skryah: or warlock pets / monk totem
[2:14:07] xpadeDK: @Arthars what's your main in 14?
[2:14:35] skryah: if you have a good lock or good monk, then the juggernauts are a non-factor
[2:15:18] skryah: DH or lock tbh

[2:20:00] skryah: hunter doesn't wanna take the one thing they're useful for xff
[2:20:02] Baf0: that's every game
[2:20:46] skryah: healer in my static refuses to play with any hunter at all
[2:20:49] ammar_alutaibi: lol

[2:24:46] skryah: this route is good
[2:24:56] skryah: although maybe I'd prefer more berserkers and less mages
[2:25:05] skryah: mages are pug killers
[2:25:15] skryah: you don't need stealth for that skip
[2:25:20] skryah: you can jump over the roots on left side
[2:25:27] skryah: ye warlock gate can do it too

[3:25:37] Ampped87: His pets are still there
[3:25:50] skryah: no defensives xff

[3:30:55] skryah: so it reduces a lot
[3:30:56] Ampped87: Cd reduction
[3:31:07] skryah: every hit reduces
[3:31:10] skryah: not just the hit from the staff
[3:31:23] skryah: yeah that's bis for a bunch of classes
[3:31:26] F0xLock: bis for like every caster
[3:31:27] skryah: even healers
[3:31:43] Goldsen_f: augmentation monk as healer xdd
[3:32:38] F0xLock: "easy" KEKW 30+ keys to get the drop and some go like 60

[3:32:53] DeanTwistedForce: Im so tired of girls chasing me
[3:32:59] Goldsen_f: the fact that they tuned classes around legendary is stupid
[3:32:59] StriveMB: i played hunter s1 didnt have lego
[3:33:03] StriveMB: but no raz bow
[3:33:12] StriveMB: until the week it got nerfed was in vault lmao

[3:37:35] skryah: rise is fucked
[3:37:39] skryah: the start is so punishing
[3:37:43] skryah: and half a minute of RP

[3:38:09] StriveMB: throne crushing depths absorb shield being 1.6m on a 26 is awesome
[3:38:19] mmosky: @arthars  can you sell wow tokens to buy gear of the market?

[3:39:06] F0xLock: be ready to go broke tho, they're like 400k a pop
[3:39:10] mmosky: Gotcha
[3:39:49] Goldsen_f: tree boss in waycrest is another annoying one for me, cuz you're basically forced to play pvp trinket in high keys unless you're a mage
[3:40:03] skryah: @Goldsen_f not necessarily
[3:40:07] skryah: you can play prot pala
[3:40:15] skryah: and manage burst cds to deal with it
[3:40:47] skryah: a lot of groups for high keys run 2 mages, or 2 palas
