[0:58:45] Medobolt: if he says he cant answer if there is a 9.3 ill be nervous KEKW
[0:59:03] Justarandomman: what can they drag out to 9.3 though storywise? isn't syl last boss in 9.1?
[0:59:14] CritcobainTV: Legion was good because there was a grind to focus on. There was things to keep people playing, mage tower came out, really cool cosmetics, stuff to obtain.
[0:59:17] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what did you think of the terrygru in PTR?
[0:59:19] CritcobainTV: Plus rogue was op so i loved it
[0:59:21] Teblin94: When is the interview?
[0:59:22] proxy2gate: whats the general perception of the exp now? i havent played since it launched
[0:59:25] BlueBeast33: I just want him to ask a few questions outside of the scope of 9.1, that's what I mean
[0:59:32] flyingmachin3: or her can just extend on those points if he really wanted to focus on it
[0:59:38] Xsilentghost: Do you think Torghast can be saved?
[0:59:53] Crossout32: as someone who would do things like max out sanctum upgrades i refuse to do so. its not a grind its almost impossible
[1:00:00] CritcobainTV: Oh. for sure. "Hey Ion, we all know shit about 9.1, you mind giving us your views on global warming?" Kappa

[1:08:09] subversv: so i just got 60 on an alt and now i have to do the entire campaign just because renown, alt friendly ?
[1:08:10] Medobolt: 9.2 and 9.3 can carry
[1:08:28] Medobolt: we can hope
[1:08:28] Justarandomman: @SensualMurderHornets i don't think they can implement another villain in 9.3
[1:08:30] Ezekyler: but the story is one of the weakest points of Shadowlands
[1:08:31] luckfore: i doubt it
[1:08:32] Justarandomman: not one that makes sense
[1:08:37] Xsilentghost: wait there might not be a 9.3 wtf
[1:08:46] Buckwink: WoD is the worst worst expac lol
[1:08:59] Justarandomman: Why would they even bring back Arthas to kill again? lmao
[1:08:59] subversv: i made tons of gold in WoD lol
[1:09:00] cbreeden: @Towelliee your About Towelliee section needs to be updated. Still says "Don't miss World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion Launch Party Nov 23rd 3PST"
[1:09:05] hokiepokey: @subversv bruh i dont understand  how people think this expansion is alt friendly and beginning of bfa wasnt, unless you were mythic raiding azerite grind was almost nonexistent in beginning of bfa
[1:09:06] minael1: i loved wod. not gonna apologize for it
[1:09:13] luckfore: 9.2 will be next year lol
[1:09:21] Buckwink: this time next year lol
[1:09:42] subversv: hokiepokey right its not at all my man. its an epic grind on each and every char almost except they mercifully finally made torghast unlock account wide 4 months in lol
[1:10:07] phatego_: wouldn't be the first time.. hell CN Mythic damn near continued to christmas
[1:10:18] Justarandomman: i think 9.2 > draught > sunwell (tbc) > blizzconn
[1:10:37] hokiepokey: @subversv preach who i usually think has great opinions complains about bfa's alt friendlyness all the time and i just dont get it, it was so alt friendly until 8.2 where ya it became horrible
[1:10:48] Xsilentghost: Okay I see what your saying
[1:10:58] luckfore: 9.2 will be the drought patch
[1:11:01] Akitor123: maybe sl will be short expansion with 3 raids
[1:11:07] luckfore: 10 months 9.2 then 10.0

[1:11:25] subversv: 9.3 arthas strikes BACK
[1:11:29] Buckwink: bfa spoiled us
[1:11:32] pikajazz32: Hey @Towelliee How are you this morning brother?
[1:11:34] PadidinJones: I think its time to call a spade a spade. We have a 3 year expac
[1:11:54] Justarandomman: Why do people mention Arthas? the only storyline he could perhaps feature in a redemption story?
[1:12:04] Medobolt: i hope they dont cut SL short
[1:12:05] Justarandomman: but even then, what impact without frostmourne
[1:12:07] swordwindgaming: Can daddy Kotick live with a 3 year xpac though?
[1:12:10] Medobolt: PepeHands
[1:12:18] TheCliffyShow: I would prefer a 3 year expansion over cutting content.
[1:12:37] PadidinJones: I really really enjoyed legion.
[1:13:10] BlueBeast33: From the Ion interview: "We've only begun to scratch the surface as to what the Shadowlands has to offer"
[1:13:23] Justarandomman: Now, perhaps 9.3 could have the 'boy-king' as a villain? - with some dialogue with arthas

[1:15:39] Medobolt: 100%
[1:15:40] flebbooo: TRUE LULW
[1:15:48] subversv: father.. is it over?

[1:15:53] subversv: i see only... darkness
[1:16:02] Buckwink: people will cry when he comes back
[1:16:02] flebbooo: oh shit, our xpac ain't doing too well.. Aye is that Arthas!!?
[1:16:05] Justarandomman: It will be illidan all over again though, like a "redemption" style Arthas
[1:16:08] ArcaneSyntax: arthas might be part if the mythic only sylvanus fight, like illidan and guldan.
[1:16:23] ShadoodHD: "No one expects the Scourge 2.0 (TM) !"
[1:16:28] swordwindgaming: Arthas is the cellphone to call back Captain America's gang

[1:26:32] oreo_mintx: I don't understand how they are so stubborn
[1:26:40] Secondbreakfasttt: this is why i unsubbed that exect reason
[1:26:40] Medobolt: after that quarterly report
[1:26:44] Medobolt: they might KEKW
[1:26:48] rhopland: doed the title mean you will have an interview or talking about the chinese one
[1:26:51] luckfore: why arent they doing it? the game is in a terrible state atm
[1:26:52] rhopland: ?
[1:26:54] Buckwink: fuck that
[1:27:04] 1rowdy8: I'm just tired of having to do the night fae compaign because every caster class is night fae
[1:27:14] mrrazputin: If you could ask Ian 3 questions during interview what would they be ?
[1:27:16] minael1: but makes no sense. cause you are tied to story.
[1:27:16] Armdel: i figured you would be locked to one, but can just switch easily in town or something
[1:27:31] jedspacecowboy: Yoo does anyone know if doing dungeons counts towards the bar you gotta fill up to go back to your old covenant? 🤔
[1:27:37] PadidinJones: but @Towelliee switching without penalty would be overkill though.
[1:27:38] oreo_mintx: I don't understand why that option wasn't baseline... I switched covenants and immediately regretted it
[1:27:38] bigoldmeatpie: it should just be the abilities and the soulbinds for each are adjusted to trigger all 4
[1:27:49] Buckwink: id rather be doing islands right now
[1:27:49] beckett3a: covenants not being tied to just story/aesthetic preferences is the biggest fault imo
[1:27:53] jedspacecowboy: Cba waiting to do 15 world quests in the zone
[1:28:01] beckett3a: but that's just pedantic at this point lol
[1:28:04] Secondbreakfasttt: for god sake people farming renown for other covenants incase they would be bis, and also there is nothing to do lmao
[1:28:13] Naturalbeef: 9.2 has a chance for free swapping
[1:28:34] oreo_mintx: the last month of the expansion we will be able to freely switch probably
[1:28:52] jedspacecowboy: I was thinking maybe having 2 covenants at a time would be awright
[1:28:56] CardinalTX: @Towelliee Do you like the FFXIV system? One toon can learn evert job?
[1:29:03] Secondbreakfasttt: @otp_ekko66 yay!
[1:29:06] rhopland: Does the title imply you will have an interview, or talking about one?
[1:29:07] Dr4gonMouse: tug it
[1:29:17] DarkhorseSix: I'll give it a yank alright
[1:29:22] Effin_Steffin: I feel you @towelliee . I had to cap Renown on 16 alts for all the covenant transmog sets.
[1:29:29] ArcaneSyntax: the essence vendor made a lot more sense than this ripcord stuff.

[1:29:39] Naturalbeef: I think the storyline is also involved in free swapping
[1:29:42] swordwindgaming: If every xpac is going to be like this hype/ripcord situation from now on, shouldn't we be hype for the END of an xpac?
[1:29:52] KaisenSiru: Same
[1:29:55] TheHardcorian: Why do they repeatedly only make these decisions at the very END of the expansion? doing this shit earlier would be less of a headache for them
[1:29:56] Fensmarken: just take the power out of the covenants man. that way people can pick whatever the fuck they think is the cool shit
[1:30:53] Broomba: On paper these systems sounds good, but executing them always backfires
[1:31:04] ravenoushydra: I mean renown is just blatantly slowing the game if you play from the start
[1:31:16] Armdel: gotta get that player play time up
[1:31:17] Akitor123: 5m 1 day

[1:36:44] Machine42593: all i do now is anima lol my guilds been done raiding for 3 weeks now
[1:36:59] Lesliech0w: I had so much hope for Choreghast in Alpha
[1:37:01] sephronz: @towelliee  do you think the item that gives you a random runecrafting legendary will be able to get the 9.1 runecrafting legendaries; or will they hotfix it so that you can only use it for the 9.0 runecrafting legos only?
[1:37:02] arblecs: no point in grinding, they will dump anima on you later the expansion
[1:37:08] casualfury: wod was better than this mess
[1:37:09] BlueBeast33: @critcobain I mean, I'm not about to dictate what other players deem important for their characters.
[1:37:09] CritcobainTV: @HwmTheWigl even when you were just starting out the gear was shit. M0s gave better gear than the ilvl of the covenant gear
[1:37:15] bhxkazzam1: the only thing SL has done for me is get me back in classic
[1:37:16] subversv: 197?
[1:37:31] CritcobainTV: @BlueBeast33 The "not an endless grind" was in regards to something being player power
[1:37:35] chrispape: cpas at 197

[1:41:21] ArcaneSyntax: i think classic tbc is 100% coming in june and 9.1 a month to a month and a half later.
[1:41:25] Vaellder: I'm gonna be honest I kind of like the pacing of this patch, I know it's a lot of time but it lets busier people like me get more stuff done
[1:41:35] Korupcija_: bro don't say that pls :(
[1:41:36] LordNebse: so TBC is before 9.1?
[1:41:36] tigzie: @Towelliee whats the purple ring around your mouse pointer?
[1:41:43] PadidinJones: I mean servers are so unstable right now its crazy
[1:42:01] sephronz: wouldnt it be ironic if 9.1 came out on the 1 year anniversary of Shadowlands being released
[1:42:02] Gooseberries: If only they used money to actually have a QA team and not use it's playerbase
[1:42:02] bhxkazzam1: i wonder what it mean for Diablo 2 Ressurected release. will it get push to end of year now since they dont want to deploy same time
[1:42:04] LordNebse: just tuned in, heard it first time
[1:42:06] LordNebse: but good to know :D
[1:42:12] Jeanssi: it's obvious at this point
[1:42:15] CardinalTX: Just turn Torghast into a solo dungeon with gear drops with Heroic and Mythic level play.
[1:42:24] Lesliech0w: Blizz loves to use those kind of releases to make up for retail content lulls
[1:42:25] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: we live on mars before 9.1
[1:42:27] casualfury: they should have released some sort of release schedule before selling the expac
[1:42:35] Korupcija_: do you think they'll announce it on preach stream?
[1:43:15] HwmTheWigl: @casualfury why would they give you a hard timeline? Just so they can screw it up and get yelled at? lol
[1:43:27] tenpo29: !room
[1:43:27] Moobot: @tenpo29 Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:43:27] ArcaneSyntax: may 18th prepatch, june 15th tbc launch
[1:43:29] Fensmarken: @Towelliee I mean unless its confirmed, you'd still call it a guess? A qualified guess. An informed prediction. But a guess nonetheless
[1:43:35] lithium364: inb4 another high elve question in preaches interview LUL
[1:43:39] casualfury: LUL
[1:43:50] bhxkazzam1: honestly wow dev team needs to go more agile and deploy smaller more often
[1:43:54] casualfury: very trustworthy
[1:43:55] PadidinJones: You cant ever have a release schedule for the whole expac
[1:44:02] PadidinJones: never*
[1:44:18] Niixten: 9.1 in july?
[1:44:18] casualfury: patreon game
[1:44:26] casualfury: LUL
[1:44:27] lithium364: at this rate the next 6month sub store mount comes out before 9.1
[1:44:27] yunitoYuniro: 10-10-21
[1:44:32] Shadowlemur01: Im sure they have an internal schedule thats more like goal posts, but i highly doubt they will ever give out a public release schedule
[1:44:36] PadidinJones: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEFUNDS!!
[1:44:42] KinggKebab: I dunno, lots of games have roadmaps, Not sure why wow can't do that
[1:44:55] Medobolt: and was delayed
[1:44:55] PadidinJones: They had to refund ppl lol!
[1:45:02] mavericks312: blizzard games have the worst communities

[1:45:13] Holysal: @StayLiftedX bc they lose no matter what
[1:45:29] CardinalTX: Blizz needs help.  Lets start a Go Fund Me for this multi dollar company
[1:45:33] lithium364: they had the chance on blizzconline to talk about that stuff, they didtn which means they havent even started on anything beyond 9.1
[1:45:39] rohdey: because they're all spoiled brats
[1:45:44] toocheap2rhyme: diablo community is alright imo
[1:45:50] kaos4666: What is you're onest opinion on Shadowlands @Towelliee  ?
[1:45:54] lanara233: which games have the bet communities?
[1:45:59] FranciscoTheMage: so @Towelliee i been sitting here listening to all this.. can you theorize about what you think is going wrong? whats the problem?
[1:46:00] lanara233: *best
[1:46:10] Shadowlemur01: Ive been playing this game since I was in middle school. Its crazy to think about it like that
[1:46:11] rohdey: League o Legends clearly does Kappa
[1:46:14] Kaihrn: you must be joking @mavericks312  have you been in LoL
[1:46:31] Loredon1995: what UI is this guys?
[1:46:35] HwmTheWigl: LoL has a caring and loving community!
[1:46:44] rohdey: lux-thos
[1:47:10] rohdey: the issue; they cant crack the whip?
[1:47:26] lithium364: im actually surprised they had no data leaks yet with so many people working from home
[1:47:28] FranciscoTheMage: why dont they bring everyone back?
[1:47:30] Sepulchair: @Loredon1995 Luxthos' Weakauras. The rest ELvUI
[1:47:37] Sepulchair: I thnk
[1:47:40] bhxkazzam1: do you think the work culture is good at blizzard atm? do you think dev are engage like back in the days?
[1:47:57] swordwindgaming: They might be dependent on intern armies who are just clocking in.

[1:48:18] lanara233: It sounds like Blizzard's structure made it hard to adapt to managing people from home

[1:50:10] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee but the pandemic is almost under control. vaccines are out. why dont they bring everyone back. get their people vaccinated or require vaccinations etc
[1:50:33] Shadowlemur01: Then they get to deal with the culture shock of coming back to the office :)
[1:50:34] Sarocus: With working from home, people want fucking endless meetings instead of just walking over and talking to someone
[1:50:41] AureliusXV: ive been flying through all this havent got it
[1:50:44] Sarocus: And those that slack get away with it
[1:50:44] FranciscoTheMage: Shit here in Texas its like there's no pandemic
[1:51:04] casualfury: LUL
[1:51:05] ArcaneSyntax: @franciscothemage only like 30% of the population is vaccinated. not sure why people just assume its over.
[1:51:06] Eupholus: been working in the office the entire time...nothing changed for me
[1:51:23] bhxkazzam1: problem is people wont want to go back, and many companies are full remote, so you wont be able to retain all your employees if you enforce them to go back

[2:00:26] Thepilli: Whats a Toon?
[2:00:26] Korupcija_: theater of pain world quest has better bosses than torghast
[2:00:34] azzurrin: MDI is boring as shit
[2:00:34] UlsterFarl: when MDI moved to youtube i forgot it even existed
[2:00:38] drkdemon808469: echo is still number one seed
[2:00:39] froglok_: You aren't interested in watching the same teams run the same comps run the same dungeons for months on end?
[2:00:44] twistedstick1: Not a fan of how YouTube does live streams.
[2:00:47] FranciscoTheMage: same here it doesnt even seem the same

[2:01:17] papaherc: Blizzard not seeing that the format needs a revamp big time is absurd to me
[2:01:19] scartotem: It'll probably be Echo. THey haven't even dropped a dungeon yest
[2:01:20] TheOGDaywalker: delicious
[2:01:26] Shadowlemur01: AWC is more interesting than MDI imo
[2:01:31] Nico_vdM: Obey Alliance, not Old Bay KEKW
[2:01:31] CADZtv: no it wasnt no one cared
[2:01:37] TheOGDaywalker: LOL

[2:02:13] flebbooo: FeelsBadMan
[2:02:15] azzurrin: eSports in WoW need to go, or have less of it

[2:03:31] bhxkazzam1: problem always you dont need to do it, i get that, but thats, they have ressource working on it, meaning less ressource for other stuff, or more testing, more delays, hence 9.1

[2:04:17] lithium364: halls of origination +15 Kreygasm
[2:04:34] Thepilli: @Towelliee  Was it Blizzards of Actiisions decision to change the platform?
[2:04:36] azzurrin: eSports in general is hurting Blizzard, I mean look at OverWatch league, it's a huge bust
[2:04:39] HyoonKang: i wish we would have complexity of diablo or poe in wow for builds
[2:04:50] TheCliffyShow: Never gonna happen @scartotem. Blizzard has stated in the past they have no interest in getting into the World First thing.

[2:54:38] SlayerLightStorm: @Broomba I'd consider just blacklisting every single negative word in the dictionary so everybody that's being super aggressive just gets timed out. towLul

[2:55:13] RiskyBusines_ez: why wouldnt their be a 9.3?
[2:55:17] edzerz: tier sets would be cool
[2:55:26] gadawgs75: I have Oondastsa up, MW on
[2:55:28] Shadowlemur01: I doubt activision would let them go that long between expacs
[2:55:28] manmower: he just blacklist the term 'covenant' for the interview
[2:55:32] RiskyBusines_ez: when hasnt their been a third patch?

[2:56:43] Harch: gotta go hard in interviews
[2:56:43] Masqerader: i hope he ask about conduit energy
[2:56:52] spekktrum19: If anything, talk about the conduit energy and their plans to alleviate much of community’s concerns about it
[2:56:54] SlayerLightStorm: Pfft, Preach looked like he got his ass whupped hard.
[2:56:57] porowozek: Sloot would be so much better for that interview
[2:56:58] Thoreya: first question shud be. when we removing conduit energy
[2:57:08] drkdemon808469: how would there be 9.3 unless in 9.2 they somehow make  arthas  last boss fight cause sylvanas being the last boss in next raid kills the jailers major helper
[2:57:15] Kromede: ion why ketchup? IonJam
[2:57:29] sinlesssinner: well at least Ion didnt take it the wrong way, hes still talking to him :)
[2:57:33] AminMckellen: whats your rare chname you have ?

[2:58:02] ArcaneSyntax: conduit energy isnt going anywhere.
[2:58:02] Masqerader: great vault fix?
[2:58:14] luckfore: i hope they add stuff to korthia
[2:58:17] Shadowlemur01: Id like him to ask about if thats all there is to korthia...
[2:58:24] GlakusWoW: a new mage tower boss inside torghast would be fucking osom tbh
[2:58:28] Gurtington_: I started shadowlands about a week ago. and the rate at which we get Anima is a little slow. yall know this. and now I can see why yall dislike that
[2:58:30] Masqerader: so sick of seeing ring, cloak legs in my vault
[2:58:31] volkreig: Torghast levelling @Towelliee
[2:58:32] manmower: ask if there are a lot more plans for korthia not yet seen
[2:58:37] Riakuu: I think Vault should give M+ loot based on which M+ you did for the week, Not random between all the dungeons
[2:58:41] Oneeye2cu: Morning Towelliee Morning stream
[2:58:43] lumaday: Twisting corridor development?

[2:59:22] AminMckellen: and essense neck
[2:59:23] shadowmoonsmile: horse mount
[2:59:29] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee my guess is that ion is going to announce torghast stuff.
[2:59:31] edzerz: class specific torghast tier sets to compete with for leaderboards
[2:59:50] Orthobullet: Do we know when this interview is happening
[2:59:55] jRizzler: Didn't Ion mention some of this during a chinese fansite interview? @Towelliee ?
[2:59:58] JonVonZombie: how often does @towelliee run ads?
[3:00:01] Shadowlemur01: Tuesday @Orthobullet
[3:00:03] jerexify: Some kind of scrapping system for legendaries.
[3:00:04] manmower: ask if they're adding back tier sets to the game, but they're torghast-only
[3:00:04] plumpus81: Make Hunters great again
[3:00:14] Masqerader: Where is my Maw skip!
[3:00:15] Masqerader: lol
[3:00:19] lumaday: Covenant campaign skips plzzz
[3:00:21] luckfore: they have been forever :P
[3:00:24] Shadowlemur01: oh god yes a maw skip please
[3:00:25] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Tat's looking good, mang.
[3:00:27] Thoreya: ion when you adding solo q. ion when you removing conduit energy. ion let us craft legendaries with no currency. let keystones at 20 give us 226 gear
[3:00:44] luckfore: they didnt even add that in 9.1
[3:00:53] lumaday: so many times
[3:00:53] Ezekyler: i want to sklp all the maw scenario
[3:00:55] Riear_: I saw Maw intro 10+ times already
[3:00:57] JonnasINF: Oh god skipping the maw intro would be so good
[3:01:08] Masqerader: the only thing that makes it fucking bearable now is having the mount
[3:01:19] ChocoDecay: solo q would just introduce more trolls to pvp imo
[3:01:24] edzerz: I don't want to drag the broken crown to it's four different places at -99% movement speed ever again.
[3:01:27] Ezekyler: just let me start at Oribos

[3:01:37] Zettabyte: "Daily login rewards" @Towelliee Kappa
[3:01:38] papaherc: wehn are we getting tow legoos to equip??
[3:01:43] BOOM_HOWER_: is it hard for someone to come back to WoW after being away for years?
[3:01:49] luckfore: they have to buff the exp you get from doing the Shadowlands questline if they  skipped the maw intro
[3:01:52] SlayerLightStorm: towUnforch
[3:02:04] lalelusa: I'm seriously questioning how many major patches SL is going to have anyways. 6 months in an 9.1 is still some time away. At this rate, 9.2 will be towards the end of the year or early 2022
[3:02:22] bozzy124: did you move towelliee?
[3:02:27] spekktrum19: Make leveling alts more worthwhile instead of looming dread knowing that it’ll take months to get any anima to do anything
[3:02:31] Wcvechten: duo legendaries would mean ridic tuning on that raid tier
[3:02:33] bozzy124: your setup looks different
[3:02:39] dreadvaine: Some little old raid tuning would be nice :D
[3:02:43] ChocoDecay: everyone would be OP as shit with 2 legos

[3:29:59] pyrocannibal00: anima is useless
[3:30:16] moopygoop: I think with how fast you level, having something that scales is nice.
[3:30:23] TheGaoSora: Ripcord memers are pathetic lol
[3:30:23] SlayerLightStorm: Heirlooms should've been left the fuck alone, would've made leveling a shit ton easier.
[3:30:30] Contravert: lego scarping is actually good idea
[3:30:49] fistofnature: no no aand no LUL
[3:30:53] arcaniia007: remove target cap plz
[3:30:53] manmower: content vs system volume
[3:30:56] qtla: I want artifacts back
[3:31:04] Shadowlemur01: oh miss the artifact weapons
[3:31:29] SlayerLightStorm: Can Blizzard PLEASE revert the changes they made to heirlooms so it makes leveling easy af?
[3:31:36] dracullus: @Towelliee before they revealed SL systems people screamed it has no content, I clearly remember that
[3:31:41] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: feels more like legion tha  bfa imo

[3:33:36] ChocoDecay: Legion was great imo. Loved raiding and the artifact weapons. Didn't like the RNG lego drops though.
[3:33:39] Masqerader: i kinda wanna see class buffs go away and just have scrolls and shit again like we did in Legion? i think it was?

[3:34:22] RocketMan23: #RemoveRaidBuffs
[3:34:23] Wcvechten: or just give that buff to more classes
[3:34:24] Affiiance: No its the only Way Monks get into raid
[3:34:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: towUnforch
[3:34:25] happybooger: i would love that question to be asked!
[3:34:52] manmower: take the buff away from the tanks, problem solved
[3:35:01] RocketMan23: ou i like that solution
[3:35:02] Contravert: that would allow more class stacking
[3:35:03] porowozek: "we want every class to bring semi unique" blah blah blah
[3:35:03] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:35:07] jeneraljelly: Yeah the very class specific buffs dont seem needed
[3:35:08] moopygoop: at that point just get rid of it
[3:35:09] torridcheese3: A healer maintaining a debuff would be pretty cool
[3:35:19] pyrocannibal00: scrolls... gone lol
[3:35:24] qtla: @Towelliee Good question would be if they can make their mind on target caping. Like some classes have and some dont, it fckd balance alot
[3:35:36] Masqerader: kinda like they should buff drums to 25%
[3:35:37] moopygoop: like you're not doing mythic raid without a tank or a healer, so at that point scrap it entirely
[3:35:44] Aro725: Ion said in the China interveiw that they dont want eveyone to have a buff to bring. They like that its unique. So i wouldnt hold my breath for that
[3:35:48] ChocoDecay: Sounds like an actual support class would be a good addition.
[3:35:52] jerseyfive: remove that s#it already
[3:35:57] Shadowlemur01: @chocobullock agreed
[3:36:10] manmower: add sundering armor back to warriors

[3:37:32] ArcaneSyntax: They could also just give the buff to more classes, not even roll based.
[3:37:34] lithium364: bring back world buffs which are purgable in warmode Kappa

[3:37:37] dmise00: make drums better !
[3:37:44] Masqerader: Just like no one gets the drums nerf, made no sense.. now it forces you to take a shaman/mage or hunter, 10% difference is a lot for people with regards to haste
[3:37:48] relicc: what about stuff like fort AI or battle shout?
[3:37:48] Vaellder: Keep those debuffs but bring back un-nerfed scrolls
[3:37:52] Tremendous_Cee: Just Give Druid back Mark, Lock can have Dark intent and Make some different debutts for other classes
[3:37:53] ArcaneSyntax: like they gave 2 other classes bloodlust, why not give these buffs to others.
[3:38:26] Tremendous_Cee: Debuffs***
[3:38:35] Shadowlemur01: DKs need Horn back
[3:38:43] qtla: Windwalker does like 60k on mass aoe pulls
[3:38:44] Yagr6: im on the side of only dps shaman should have lust since they are always under tuned

[3:40:04] WunderbarTsar: talking about the openis ^^
[3:40:04] Yagr6: prideful buff just makes them insane too
[3:40:18] RogueBear: dude it would be one thing if they only gutted flamestrike damage but those nerfs arent just AoE
[3:40:22] RogueBear: its gunna be huge
[3:40:25] nightst314: @Towelliee are all these chars parked on isle of giants all the time?
[3:40:26] 3663Sharad: The nerfs seem more to be a change to the climbing stat points, imo
[3:40:34] arcaniia007: kindling gets nerfed from 1.5 to 1s.
[3:40:37] lithium364: let the arcane dream live on
[3:40:40] RogueBear: their BiS conduit got nerfed 20%

[3:42:43] moopygoop: I'm new to actually doing M+, are the seasonal affixes usually so tank routing spefic?
[3:42:45] RogueBear: combustion is taking a 20% nerf on the conduit alone and that wont just be AoE. the flamestrike and flame patch nerfs could have been enough if they didnt gut combustion so hard. im probably going frost for 9.1
[3:42:50] lukepizzaguy: also for EU ?
[3:43:10] qtla: That fight feels like we have artifact weapons again
[3:43:28] Daggerstry: Morning Towelliee
[3:43:33] Masqerader: @moopygoop with prideful its more strict, mostly on tyrannical weeks,
[3:43:49] Contravert: @RogueBear they are nerfing scaling
[3:44:03] ChocoDecay: I'm hoping frost dk goes back up the ranks. Unholy isn't my thing.
[3:44:05] NanotronRofl: Sire Denathrius was an easy end-raid boss fight
[3:44:08] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee I wear my Night Fae Hammer Squad shirt whenever I am at home chillin'. After a few washes, it's still SUPER comfortable.
[3:44:15] Tomaterrs: heroic went up i´d say
[3:44:48] RogueBear: @Contravert possibly. it depends how strong the conduit is going to be when you get the 9.1 iLvl versions of Infernal Cascade.
[3:44:58] Masqerader: Blood Council seemed like more of a  POS fight than any other lol
[3:45:08] moopygoop: @Masqerader yea, prideful is my first seasonal, I get prideful, curious if it's always like this
[3:45:15] Contravert: @RogueBear you also unlock a 3rd potency, and we already have pyro and flamestrike damage conduiots
[3:45:18] Shrenko: Panda is progressing on Denathrius now and they do p1 and 2 pretty easly!
[3:45:31] Masqerader: @moopygoop get mdt and plan routes
[3:45:50] NanotronRofl: Yeah, the 2 realms phases at n'zoth were the challenge of that fight imo

[3:46:38] BubbaChubbs420: Ashara?
[3:46:42] moopygoop: @Masqerader I understand, I use mdt and have routes, it's totally fine, I'm asking "is it always so you need pride before hakkar" or is it sometimes more flexible
[3:46:43] Frank4LuLz: deathwing???????
[3:46:44] Daggerstry: Don't forget to work on your posture Towelliee
[3:46:46] Masqerader: Remember all our poor foxes on KJ with our realm first @Towelliee and that was bfa
[3:46:55] mrrazputin: Jaina ?
[3:47:10] Masqerader: @moopygoop it helps a lot on for that fight
[3:47:16] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Arms or Fury for a Warrior going as DPS?
[3:47:19] ChocoDecay: For us Orgozoa and queens court in bfa were tough but our team since then has broke up and went separate ways.
[3:47:30] ChocoDecay: never got to zaqul
[3:47:38] pjahj: Ghuun last phase pre nerf was a pain
[3:47:38] NILLme: ghuun was annoying in the end too
[3:47:48] BubbaChubbs420: what about Azshara?
[3:47:54] Masqerader: Mu'ru is still the king of "fuck you bosses" pre nerf
[3:48:11] Vaellder: I feel like g'huun was definitely way harder at the end than the beginning
[3:48:23] ZakuzaGB: even azshara HC was like wtf
[3:48:30] lithium364: Uunat monkas
[3:48:35] Laluzmia: going to order a new rig do you have code I need to put so you get credit for it Towelliee

[4:20:16] 91Niki: @Towelliee Yeah being bipolar, it's hard to do anything consistently. Speaking from personal experince

[4:21:42] UlsterFarl: Was later into WOD for those dips as well.
[4:21:45] Uutef: there was mdi finals on youtube yesterday
[4:21:46] Bombayshow: covid probably burned out a lot of people
[4:21:51] Layercake: Apart of Naguura and the echo people pushing high m+ is hard to pull more than 2/3k people
[4:21:54] Bombayshow: they played  a lot while curfew
[4:22:00] ChocoDecay: @Tacoma64 Definitely. He's streams on his 2nd channel seem must more relaxed and chill but only a fraction of the viewers. People love the character.
[4:22:08] TheOGMed: Its been slim for sure
[4:22:24] plushack: I fell like SL pushed away a lot of more casual player base. There is huge gap which they can't just pass with gearing to have more content to do
[4:22:32] Roadskii: lol get vaccinated ok
[4:22:42] Eviltuna13: weather is getting warmer so people going out more

[4:23:50] ZakuzaGB: social distancing tho
[4:24:02] Democritus33: what about cold tub stream?
[4:24:37] Masqerader: @Roadskii it doesn't track mythic + anymore, its kinda just there.
[4:24:46] shimwood: too many erect nipples for an ice bath stream
[4:24:49] Kromede: booba.tv has all the good twitch content Kappa
[4:25:26] Roadskii: @Masqerader id be more than happy to  discuss in pm at some point
[4:25:33] pyrocannibal00: time to attempt slime serpent
[4:26:11] Masqerader: @Roadskii what is there to discuss, i got to the site, I look at my char, it doesn't show anything related to mythic + just bfa season 4, it tracks raids, and ur ilvl but for mythic + its dead compared to raiderio

[4:44:02] maccaruso: That's not dangerous at al.......

[5:47:11] enux337: battle pass?
[5:47:34] Zerofkgiven: is this game pay 2 win?
[5:47:51] Zerofkgiven: life isnt fair
[5:47:52] Plague7: @Zerofkgiven Ofc, it's a mobile game xD
[5:47:55] enux337: i know about he mtx
[5:48:21] Xanigh: Is that game free to play tho? or something you buy and then there's the store?
[5:48:26] iToivo: @plague7 no its not a pay 2 win game quit hating on mobile games
[5:48:27] disco57im11: do you drink alcohol?
[5:48:33] quakegoogl: towBeer ruyuF PopCorn Squid1
[5:49:25] Xanigh: Oh cool
[5:49:26] BootyScavenger: @iToivo 99% of multiplayer mobile games are p2w. So yeah. They are trash.
[5:49:39] iToivo: @bootyscavenger who asked you
[5:50:07] superluboss: is there auto combat?
[5:50:08] Gourizaga: @BootyScavenger Very true
[5:50:23] umadbrew1: true

[5:50:27] Plague7: @iToivo This game is definately p2w, if you don't pay for the product, that means YOU are the product.
[5:50:31] Huffthegreat: !build
[5:51:17] iToivo: @plague7 has towelliee purchased anything in this game yet? no, hmm must be p2w LUL that logic is very good
[5:51:19] Pistolero1995: the MTX could always be only cosmetic tho, no need to be power gains

[5:51:36] Huffthegreat: What build/character you running ??
[5:51:42] enux337: thats deep
[5:51:47] Gurtington_: when my p.c. broke and I only had my phone to play. I played codm,  Pokémon tcg,  magic the gathering online, and stadia. all on my phone. so having an extra game, especially a dungeon crawler that's a triple AAA game will be a plus. plus it'll rake in millions for blizzard to hopefully distribute to other i.p's
[5:51:49] rymerre: damn thats deep
[5:52:07] Annyongg: Are you running this on an ipad?
[5:52:21] Invergamarium: is this game out on iOS?
[5:52:33] BootyScavenger: Its just sad they chose to keep this strictly on mobile and not make a PC port to go along with it.... Knowing damn well that the Diablo franchise originated on PC...
[5:52:35] Annyongg: This is closed alpha
[5:52:35] dannyd1020: !room
[5:52:35] Moobot: @dannyd1020 Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:52:35] Gurtington_: they coulda used the time making diablo mobile to make another game. but having a good triple AAA game on mobile never hurt anyone
[5:52:35] MrGattz: no its not out yet
[5:52:36] Alaquane: stream title says alpha
[5:52:41] superluboss: its closed alpha
[5:52:56] cordawg: How is it looking down all day?  thats like my biggest issue with mobile games.
[5:53:00] Huffthegreat: I’m triggered closed alpha
[5:53:03] ThePawPaw: 2 years or 3 of alpha LUL
[5:53:13] ThePawPaw: Diablo 4 in 10 years :D
[5:53:21] IverCold: @BootyScavenger They are going to release Diabo IV too But it looks shitty already in development
[5:53:28] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee how many hours are you into the game?
[5:53:38] Derichian: @Pocketmitti But they are making other games. Having People work on 1 game doesn't stop them making others.
[5:53:42] ThePawPaw: damn Diablo 3 will hit 9 years soon LUL
[5:54:05] BootyScavenger: Diablo 4 will be years... They could've released this ALONG with D2R considering Immortal takes place after D2 and before D3.
[5:54:05] Plague7: Diablo 2 Remake and Diablo 4 looks good so far though, I hope they don't mess it up.. But knowing Blizzard nowdays, one can never be too certain. x)
[5:54:21] larraxik: Regarding the Rite of Exile, 10 top dark houses take on immortals and become immortals themselves if succeed. There might be max of 500 immortals per server. Does that mean dark houses have 50 max members each?
[5:54:25] MrGattz: @BootyScavenger they could have should have done a lot of things.
[5:54:32] BootyScavenger: Yup.
[5:54:33] Gurtington_: @derichian yeah I know. I'm saying that having a side team making a GOOD quality mobile game is nothing but a boon for blizzard. and I'm all for it.
[5:54:52] DeadMonkeyD: Hi mate , What are you playing on?
[5:55:17] quakegoogl: PopCorn draRage
[5:55:29] Garrujak: I really hope the market is Immortal only and that D4 doesn't have it
[5:55:40] superluboss: looks like an iphone or ipad
[5:55:43] DeadMonkeyD: What do you think guys... Diablo Immortal first or D2R ?
[5:55:43] ThePawPaw: so is this new alpha different from the last one? i mean is it still UI copy of the china game?
[5:56:06] ThePawPaw: @DeadMonkeyD lol
[5:56:08] Huffthegreat: Same
[5:56:34] DeadMonkeyD: @thepawpaw yes!
[5:56:36] Garrujak: They haven't, but the Market is for sure what ruined D3 for a long time. I assume Blizz learned that lesson, but still a tad nervous
[5:56:37] rymerre: trading used to be a core part of diablo
[5:56:41] Xanigh: Didin't they say that d4 is gonna hve cosmetic store, nothing wrong about that tho
[5:56:44] beermugger: Can you play this with a Bluetooth controller?
[5:56:47] mxzgaming_: This game for real look so awesome!
[5:56:56] mxzgaming_: For a mobile game is so cool!
[5:57:10] Gurtington_: have yall noticed that in WoW your main Bag that you start with. they blocked off the bottom row unless you set up an authenticator. That too me feels eerily like a cheap Chinese mobile games "pay us $0.99 to have one slot extra in your bag."
[5:57:18] TialePetit: beermugger  no controller at this point.. it is alpha still

[5:57:20] ThePawPaw: @DeadMonkeyD i would say it will be diablo 2 but they failed with making D4 and now with immortals...OW2.....etc so will be long untill they release something
[5:57:25] Huffthegreat: How’s a market ruin a single player game
[5:57:39] ThePawPaw: @DeadMonkeyD i will never forget the war 3 reforge
[5:57:41] Garrujak: @Pocketmitti but the mobile authenticator is free, so it's not quite looking for money
[5:57:58] beermugger: @tialepetit thanks, i would play it on my iPad with a controller
[5:58:01] ProjectSevan: @Pocketmitti It's mostly an incentive to make people secure their accounts
[5:58:16] DeadMonkeyD: @thepawpaw I hope to have both of them at this year blizzcon
[5:58:34] ThePawPaw: praying for you :}
[5:58:34] Gurtington_: @garrujak yeah it is free. but the system is there. just replace it with 0.99$ and it's all ready to go. it just feels wrong. even if it IS free. idk. I don't like that. that one is the scariest to mee
[5:58:38] macrophages: is this on Android or iOS?

[5:58:45] Huffthegreat: OP
[5:58:45] ThePawPaw: i would love D2 for sure im fan of DRUID class :}
[5:59:03] ProjectSevan: where does this game fall in the story of things?
[5:59:15] Lexide: after d2 prior to d3
[5:59:15] TialePetit: @Pocketmitti ge the authenticator on mobile and it's free.. Not sure how you put the two together.. one is secure your acct and we'll give you a gift.. other is pay money for more space" examples.
[5:59:30] DeadMonkeyD: I’m really hyped for this game!
[5:59:46] DeadMonkeyD: Nice to play on the go some Diablo
[6:00:09] Titosamson: suuup brotha
[6:00:12] freddisho: So when can we play this game ?

[6:00:41] v1v1_mage: This game needs to hurry and drop already
[6:00:44] mattoxi: 2021 Q4
[6:00:54] Garrujak: @Pocketmitti that's fair, but also we have so much bag space already, no one would buy 4 slots for $0.99 imo. All my alts rock 32 slotters, I have no use for 4 extra slots
[6:01:10] Huffthegreat: This game looks done what’s the hold up on the release
[6:01:28] Gurtington_: @tialepetit becuase it feels exactly like those tricks they use in mobile games to get every penny out of you. it just FEELS like it. I know it's free. but why block off my bag inventory to make me get the authenticator? why not have the option at the main menu and not bar me from basic amenities?
[6:01:34] DeadMonkeyD: Yes, at blizzcon
[6:01:37] Mcubed: i played this at blizzcon and dis shit was actually really good
[6:01:45] eu_monkey: How does the Game feel Towelliee ?
[6:02:13] Pistolero1995: @Pocketmitti its not previous owned space thats now blocked off tho, its extra on top of what youve always had
[6:02:48] rymerre: thats def not a thing on D3
[6:03:15] Gurtington_: ooh ok. if it's NEW space. then that makes it better. I thought it was locking out space I had before hand. regardless I'm not a fan of this thank you for the info though @pistolero1995

[6:22:34] crazygiz_zgz: Well, Immortal takes place between D2 and D3 so it makes sense
[6:22:34] piratechris: Same gems
