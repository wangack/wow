[0:40:23] ooNITRO: Maybe new mage scrolls double? Idk
[0:40:30] Rmont: yeah you may need LIPs and shit
[0:40:32] Rmont: to get there

[0:58:56] Tinit5190: Pretty sure STV is full on FFA, with some penalty for raids
[0:59:03] Rmont: Yeah I dont think you'll group up at all really
[0:59:04] zomnipotent: it is FFA outside of group
[0:59:25] Tinit5190: might be a spawn or something we don't know
[0:59:29] Rmont: I think you'll get a debuff for grouping
[0:59:40] zomnipotent: hmmm, to main rogue or druid...
[0:59:55] Rmont: Opting out of the Blood Moon PvP event will not put you in a different layer. It will simply keep you friendly with players from your faction, while still applying on any normal server PvP rules. This means you can still be attacked by the opposite faction if you are flagged for PvP, but you will not grant any Blood Moon rewards when killed, or earn any when you kill other players.
[1:00:00] Rmont: From the recent DEV Q&A
[1:00:27] Rmont: So the inverse would be, blood mon event makes you hostile to friendly faction

[1:02:17] Spyke_ZGZ: They're basically a necessity

[3:11:08] AtomicHydraa: i still gotta get through some more enshrouded was getting really into it
[3:11:16] AtomicHydraa: yea they nerfed what we knew from vanilla
[3:11:19] ukko83: the building is kind of insane with the voxel based. its like mini minecraft blocks
[3:11:24] Jkorn415: I think GDPK verbiage was any gold for items or exp, might not be able to boost much anymore
[3:11:27] xecksi: dont think they have it in for sod
[3:11:33] AtomicHydraa: ^ right! @ukko83
[3:11:40] Convoak: The Vietnamese place was closed so now I’m depressed
[3:11:50] AtomicHydraa: terrain manipulation is super dope
[3:12:10] Jkorn415: Well yea but the wording mentions items or exp so they may consider dungeon boosting within that now

[3:14:17] ukko83: since 2006?
[3:14:25] Rmont: where are you seeing them mention exp?
[3:14:40] Tinit5190: Don't mention it in the wowhead post
[3:14:44] Rmont: the blue post said "We’re defining GDKP as any raid or dungeon run where items are awarded in exchange for gold"
[3:14:57] AtomicHydraa: ^
[3:15:06] Rmont: pretty damn clear c ut
[3:15:48] Rmont: I think their living flame change is enough to kill most boosting anyway
[3:15:53] AtomicHydraa: no and yes lol
[3:16:06] Rmont: like pre-60 boosting
[3:16:14] AtomicHydraa: it works if your within a level but if I was 40 boosting your 25 no

[3:18:15] OroreuxTorii: that was less annoying then I thought getting my UI back to spec.. I never did transfer anything from my old tower to this one so that prolly is the reason
[3:18:15] Tinit5190: I'm debating doing it on the rogue too just for faster regen but thats a ton of bag space
[3:18:56] xecksi: copy the wtf and interface folder
[3:19:00] OroreuxTorii: i thought about that but figured it was a good lil memory refresher since i only did it once XD

[3:20:55] The_Venom_Inside: aka wispering and offering
[3:20:58] OroreuxTorii: i do it
[3:21:16] OroreuxTorii: i mean not RMT but ill offer the gold if i have it
[3:21:16] Rmont: I would think so yeah
[3:21:45] AtomicHydraa: i would think thats fine because its not the entire raid deemed GDKP like if u wanted to buy it off a guildie
[3:21:46] The_Venom_Inside: I mean if the whole raid format is normal and ur buying just one item I would hope not
[3:21:59] emly_e7: 0
[3:22:00] Rmont: its an item from a dungeon or raid exchanged for gold, thats a no go lol

[3:23:26] justspunk: they can set any number of things as flags in the log
[3:23:47] Rmont: You would need to swap like an item you won earlier for it or something
[3:23:48] emly_e7: so basically mercing is illegal

[3:25:18] OroreuxTorii: if me and a dps roll on Hydra sword and the other person wins... why would they just trade it to me for free is what I am saying.. mise well take you the ability to trade the item all together
[3:25:25] The_Venom_Inside: I run stop signs when its night time too zeegers Kappa
[3:25:41] AtomicHydraa: oh no i 100% agree im just saying their line of "trading items for money"
[3:25:42] The_Venom_Inside: LUL
[3:25:51] AtomicHydraa: ^
[3:25:54] Rmont: you run the raid again and try to win the roll next time it drops like a sane person lol

[3:26:32] Rmont: entire reason theres BoE and BoP
[3:26:33] OroreuxTorii: idk i might be thinking about it wrong
[3:26:39] justspunk: they can have a script that reads the logs with set paramaters
[3:27:08] justspunk: and have no effort involved.

[3:43:09] OroreuxTorii: XD XD
[3:43:15] Topher_IRL: It's very broad to give them the ability to interpret it as they see fit I imagine
[3:43:42] Rmont: I just think it'll 100% be scripted with very little human oversight, so pretty risky
[3:44:16] Rmont: Maybe they'll look for multiple infractions before labeling someone a GDKPer, but all risk
[3:44:17] OroreuxTorii: lol for me there is no reason to do raids with people outside the guild any more XD
[3:44:40] Rmont: Played this game since 2004 and never bought a drop off a pug lol

[3:47:05] Rmont: but who knows
[3:47:23] Rmont: Ive definitely had people whisper me and offer to buy stuff
[3:47:44] OroreuxTorii: i understand that it comes from the idea of "play the game" but how many times you gotta lose the roll before the game is playing you XD XD
