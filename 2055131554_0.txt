[0:13:17] futurafree_: shadowform reduces 50% mana cost of shadow spells (actual talent change)
[0:13:28] Deadge_Gartic: @aceassination because you wanna kill the boss close to your burst window usually

[0:17:08] Deadge_Gartic: with 40 lvl cap
[0:17:10] Deadge_Gartic: more talent points
[0:17:12] Redgamer94: @Savix you see they are finding runes already

[0:17:45] Litinia: its never "crucial" lol its just a QoL
[0:17:46] mrwaddles22: they want it to be a gold sink. and with mounts at 40...they didnt wanna add two gold sinks. most likely lvl 50 is the educated guess
[0:18:06] Chrigss: they keep saying its a gold sink to have dual spec, but how is that worse than constantly having to go back forth?
[0:18:19] Deadge_Gartic: yeah exactly
[0:18:21] Deadge_Gartic: just add it
[0:18:23] misomander: not immune Pog

[3:11:40] insaniacc_: @Savix they disabled all new runes apparently
[3:11:43] SgtPepperTTV: The books were dropping in SM, Spellfrost bolt rune dropped for Mages in the open world from a mob, and the buff was live but they reverted it all. So if you have it you get to be a god for 48 hours and blast everyone.
[3:11:44] insaniacc_: you can have them but not use them
[3:11:47] misomander: ok nothing to do for 2 days time to login to retail aaaa
