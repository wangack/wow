[6:00:06] eyxx: it's orbin time
[6:00:39] Texfone: i don't play wow so I may be not seeing mechanics correctly, but it looks like you just have to match the colors you get assigned with the orbs flaoting to the boss. So along with your usual rotation and other projectiles, is there another mechanic going on?
[6:01:02] Texfone: my point being what is causing the group to fail so much at that part
[6:01:06] dranet11: @Texfone alot of damage going out + dps check
[6:01:33] Texfone: oh so they have to do enough dps or they get one shot or something

[6:06:28] Dandaros: Okayge
[6:07:13] giantblobber: Any good vault drops today

[6:07:31] Texfone: gotcha, thanks
[6:07:35] giantblobber: Vault is the worst kind of gamble
[6:08:16] eyxx: @Dandaros the locations are set but the pattern is random
[6:08:27] eyxx: might be the same amount of each color each time idk
[6:08:34] emecci: ill pad :b
[6:08:44] wulfgang71: if fyrakk dies in february, the tree will be saved and a seed shall be planted to be birth to the return of all tree emotes in march
