[5:43:44] DanteKorvinus: google - What is halfway to 60 vanilla wow? To get to level 60 by just grinding you need to slay 16,339 at-level mobs, and the half way point, in raw mobs slain, is somewhere around level 44.
[5:43:44] andreasdagen: @anjin89 I think they compensated for that
[5:43:44] Londorlorian: last like 5 level go unexpectedly fast imo @sodapoppin
[5:43:44] VynnDK: Numerical midpoint

[5:43:49] kangamagna: 44 is a fun time, scarlet geared doing ulda and ZF
[5:43:50] prodigiousgaming: No
[5:43:52] KaeIco: so it would take damn near 3 1/2 days in game to hit 60

[5:44:05] Ampitere: or somewhere around there
[5:44:05] VtheVictim: XP wise is right after level 48 ding
[5:44:06] stitcherking: 30
[5:44:08] andreasdagen: it cant be 42 in total xp, but in time
[5:44:08] izoc_o: but you get more xp at higher levels so is it really the halfway

[5:44:14] AcesFull: 44 is the xp midpoint but you get more xp per quest/mob at those levels so its kinda a lie
[5:44:15] sircrumpler: 40-60 is a long time
[5:44:16] prodigiousgaming: Yeah for sure
[5:44:17] daelysid: xp amount wise, not sure. But according to Quests XP and time-wise, 40ish 100%
