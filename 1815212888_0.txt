[1:18:54] anjin89: having it on the fly is trash but respeccing for free at the major cities would be dope
[1:18:57] Dolphincat85: make dual spec like 1k gold to unlock
[1:18:59] gayforcandy: they could easily apply limits to dual spec in vanilla cause it is its own thing
[1:18:59] mith124: did they change the rule about starting in the same zone? thats cool if so

Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

[11:32:44] sedael: Cheer500 The Alabama beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus ammobates) is a federally endangered species which lives along the Alabama coast. The range of the Alabama beach mouse historically included much of the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the Alabama Gulf coast and extends from Ono Island to Fort Morgan. Coastal residential and commercial development and roadway construction have fragmented and destroyed habitat used by this species.
