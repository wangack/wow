[1:28:58] EmanuShow: Dairy? tell us more "Mhmm"
[1:29:10] drazzil7: It's the vegan propaganda show of the century. They are so non scientific even. The control is so bad since they arent doing controlled diets.
[1:29:40] Habituron: there is certainly irony in any media telling you media is manipulating you
[1:30:24] Mikey1678: yeah, not to mention other factors can make an impact like stress, anxiety etc
[1:30:40] Mourningztar: theyd need to do a year to see real results
[1:30:56] Habituron: 8 weeks? for a diet study? seems AWFULLY short
[1:31:29] fwankey: :tf:
[1:31:31] mmarcotic: I guess you do get better results than with two completely random people, but what you're saying just sounds like marketers and PR people had more influence than the scientists
[1:32:03] Darkun8: Sadge
[1:32:06] drazzil7: So in order not to die. Dont press incarn SeemsGood
[1:32:28] Artheeri: 🔴

[1:38:09] AceReformed: I mean any case study that does small sample controlled diet testing, in a short time period too boot, to draw conclusion from a single test is by default downright fake Shruge
[1:38:13] 6sonofchaos6: This week is perfect to push though
[1:38:35] Mikey1678: yeah i have the same issue with my shadow priest :(
[1:39:25] AceReformed: Also to even think of drawing any conclusion in food science is considered pseudoscience at best, because food science is still very complex
[1:39:25] Kuroz: can get 1k more for the km, substract a bit for the rest
[1:39:52] Eu_Mizt: can you share the playlist? :)

[4:56:15] normageqq: that's just how everyone should treat anything on the internet
[4:56:31] xRelith: Oh I cut adds for Make-Up companies and it made me realise that nothing you see online that has remotely to do with product placement is true xD
[4:56:38] Zirconn__: my mother was convinced an alien video was real and I’m like bro I could do better CGI by slamming my mouse against the keyboard
[4:57:08] paxt12: is there a key level where voice comms are 100% needed?

[4:58:46] xRelith: Unidentified Flying Object yeah
[4:58:48] AceReformed: @Sothis_best_girl NAHHH that is 2000% capping, woman say nice thing about other woman ALL the time, try being a guy, literally saying things like " Nice shoes bro" might be considered gay KEKLEO
[4:58:56] Zirconn__: most people don’t know the acronym
[4:58:57] hoeness1: happens LUL
[4:58:59] m3tabee_: nice naguura...you messed that up lool
[4:59:11] Sothis_best_girl: @AceReformed you seem to be missing the point
[4:59:15] mika01: yep very likely
[4:59:21] horakk8: Ufo exist but they are made by humans
[4:59:29] jlaw_89: rotfl this channel
[4:59:30] Sothis_best_girl: @AceReformed the issue isn't being gay, I am gay as fuck, the issue is that any expression of our sexuality is seen as creepy/predatory
[4:59:41] HecticSpaniard: and thats it LUL
[4:59:42] Zirconn__: Jesus today has been a roller coaster in chat
[4:59:45] HecticSpaniard: i agree
[5:00:14] Virelo: makes more sense that aliens are from a alternate dimension then another planet
[5:00:18] StanTheOldMan: If they are smart enough to find they are smart enough to stay the fuck away 😅
[5:00:42] Zirconn__: someone made a post about how earth is the uncontacted tribe of the universe and I haven’t slept the same ever since
[5:00:47] AceReformed: That's being gay for you in general, in even more "friendlier" countries, a lot of people still disagree with it @Sothis_best_girl
[5:00:56] OviTheGray: is kinda imposbile that out of billions of planets, only earth has life on it.. so they have to exist.. maybe not here .. but somewhere out there
[5:00:58] Chrisfo79: Why would they visit us in the first place? Earth is a shitshow LUL
[5:01:32] horakk8: What if nzoth exists
[5:02:01] TotallyNotRaien: that cannibal tribe?
[5:02:41] Zirconn__: uncontacted tribes exist on earth today. the general consensus is that we leave them alone because historically tribes die out VERY quickly when meeting modern humans
[5:03:00] Kedor2k: Some planet with worms
[5:03:21] Zirconn__: so the theory is that we think we’re alone but perhaps we’re being left alone on purpose
[5:03:37] Chrisfo79: @Zirconn__ Indeed. One big reason is that they haven't built an immune system towards the germs and viruses we may walk around with.
[5:03:43] bluemagic212121: ??
[5:03:50] Shekelpvp: tbf there prolly are aliens but we wont see them in our lifetime so fuck em lets play wow 24/7
[5:03:53] Dynender: i left for a while, is that guy still mad about italian bread? @Naguura
[5:04:05] Anelit21: Uranus and Neptune are my favorite ones
[5:04:07] shexchoklad: are we still talking about bread?
[5:04:10] shexchoklad: im confused
[5:04:41] Zirconn__: aliens probably salt their bread
[5:05:01] OviTheGray: true.. but also.. billions of planets.. i'd say highly possible

[5:05:17] SerThunderbeans: They recently found yet another smexy "super-earth" in the ideal habitable zone of a red dwarf... Some 137 lightyears away, far as I recall PauseChamp
[5:05:24] murksi: KEKW
[5:05:25] horakk8: Everything is possible
[5:05:26] Nurse_Leira: there is the thought out there too, that there may have been other life forms but its possible as they grew and explored with technology that they killed themselves off due to ruining their planet or other factors coming in like a life ending asteroid or something. We could be the smartest life form around due to simply being left. Or we may be the annoying neighbor that everyone ignores.
[5:05:27] zacaries_: except for the fact there has been proof of life on other planets
[5:05:45] Zirconn__: see
[5:05:46] Sprinklerz: inb4 they cant eat gluten
[5:05:48] ppdxd: they prolly have some galaxy bread thats even better
[5:05:48] Zirconn__: you’re not over it
[5:06:04] Zirconn__: I seriously hope you never break the law
[5:06:09] PapaCora: You will dream about that bread thing i guess... xD
[5:06:33] ChaosRenown: im gonna post the bread copy pasta when she casts mdi and its going to be amazing
[5:06:51] Zirconn__: you’ll somehow get life in prison over a parking ticket with the way you handle lying to yourself
[5:07:21] horakk8: But talking about aliens is the same as ghosts/demons

[5:08:23] AceReformed: Earth is also perfectly placed, moon & jupitor are perfectly protecting us from almost all astroids etc too, and we are at a perfect distance too our star
[5:08:28] shantihi: The sun will eat the earth when it becomes a red giant.
[5:08:33] mmarcotic: amogus?

[5:11:49] Sothis_best_girl: @OlaF_oo if only endboss was left then you could've still timed that
[5:11:51] OlaF_oo: @ppdxd pack
[5:12:00] mateus_darc: balance druid seems to be pretty bad in smalls packs
[5:12:00] AceReformed: The artist is dutch, he's singing french and dutch
[5:12:08] AceReformed: Well this is the english version
[5:12:20] ppdxd: i mean pack takes like 2 min and boss 4 could be possible but unlikely
[5:12:34] OlaF_oo: was just watching a streamer do it on 26 and it took them 8 min after morchie
