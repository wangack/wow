[2:06:00] Thoreya: towDance towDance
[2:06:02] Qoax: well panda still has keys from the last 6 expansions so he wont need the 30 for this week :D
[2:06:03] Murray_2k6: how is cata related to classic didnt it end with woltk?
[2:06:06] Perseus_IRL: how many expansion are they going to do for classic?
[2:06:19] hammertofall: nifty gifties
[2:06:25] TheSpace_Sloth: @TheCountMST He has explained it like 12 times the mods have also explained it
[2:06:25] felegolas: they should stop at Wrath
[2:06:26] Nightrox: 2 Years ago i've got a beta key just with a random generator
[2:06:40] felegolas: that imo is the end of the "Classic" era of WoW
[2:06:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they should do all the expansions for Classic, it kind of makes sense to give people a chance to play through them all
[2:06:51] TollBoothVideos: These animations are so nostalgic
[2:06:55] Rudric_Ice: are you liking HOTD more or Rings of Power ?
[2:06:59] r0b928: Are you doing a wrath marathon?
[2:07:02] TheSpace_Sloth: @TheCountMST wait misunderstood you nvm lol
[2:07:04] silodin: @Towelliee Is the cata survey real?!
[2:07:08] TheCountMST: @TheSpace_Sloth That's what I'm saying...he's gonna give us a heads up. People gotta chill.
[2:07:19] Perseus_IRL: yes
[2:07:26] Zombiestain: Legion Legio
[2:07:28] okdude312: Cataclysm: Again

[2:07:31] okdude312: lol
[2:07:32] Aquadriel: dont worry classic is already undevalued by itself KEKW
[2:07:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Cataclysm Revisited" would be fine with me
[2:07:35] Nottinghams: shadowlands classic Kappa
[2:07:39] Doomsmoothie: i wouldnt stop them from making legion "classic"  legion is my fav expac so far
[2:07:42] TToD: !beta
[2:07:50] captain_e: Classic should really be just vanilla imo
[2:07:50] Ramoneko: xD
[2:07:51] Crowdog76: Do a new xpac after Wrath....alternate story line type of thing
[2:07:52] Nightrox: Just Imagine Legion but with all the fixes from 9.3
[2:07:53] BeeboBiggins: Wow cata-oh shit here we go again
[2:07:56] WhiteKnight74648: Cataclysm: Awe shit here we go again.
[2:08:01] mavericks312: towel whats your thoughts on the colts releasing there kicker?
[2:08:04] Mecabeast: cata classic will probably happen
[2:08:05] Zilberg: Shadowlands reforged Kappa
[2:08:13] Rudric_Ice: just rename it to - Cataclysm: Returns
[2:08:21] silodin: Classic classic when?
[2:08:27] Aethn: Holly just needs to do like she did for Everquest and make a global name like EQ's has, Time-Locked  Progression Servers or TLP's
[2:08:27] OhNinjaPlease: I'm back
[2:08:27] Doomsmoothie: hell ya xD
[2:08:28] captivate7: that was the best part about it imo, not knowing when you'd get one lol

[2:08:47] sptheory: haha legion, on its release my lvl 93 rogue received legendary legs from opening a chest.
[2:08:47] Qoax: cant wait for classic shadowlands
[2:08:55] lldeathlordll: @TheSpace_Sloth that's your luck's problem Kappa
[2:08:58] Xthedarknight99x: call it cata flashpoint and just do a redesign lol
[2:08:58] OhNinjaPlease: I'm so sad I missed Legion, didn't really get to experience artifact weapons. I wonder will they add Evoker artifact weapons in
[2:09:00] Zippaya: for the Legion, we need to survive Draenor first :D
[2:09:01] Periphereal: classic dragonflight finna be lit
[2:09:04] Aysen___: i was hyped to play spriest until yd blizz post

[2:09:14] TheSpace_Sloth: @lldeathlordll lmao truuuue
[2:09:16] denflup: i bet wow token is coming in cata classic
[2:09:17] Rudric_Ice: i got a legendary from Blingtron KEKW
[2:09:22] ArcaneSyntax: every version of "classic" after wrath is just a worse version of retail.
[2:09:24] Honvar: @Qoax Yeah, I want to play that so I don't need to play on retail Kappa
[2:09:31] Zombiestain: what about classic +?
[2:09:34] monkvicious: @Towelliee They can't actually think that Classic Cata is a good idea...right?
[2:09:48] BoezIRL: classic wod
[2:09:50] therealflaminglion: Clasic BFA will be the best. Just imagine clasic island expeditions :D
[2:09:57] deedeemegadoodooo: they def would lol
[2:09:58] TheSpace_Sloth: I'd play classic cata until DS release tbh
[2:09:58] BoezIRL: I wouldn't
[2:10:03] felegolas: Classic+ seems way more appealing than continuing to roll out expansions
[2:10:05] UpSlash: I enjoyed Cata, I would play it regardless of what they call it
[2:10:10] CapsuleCorpEmployee: But I could just play current at that point lol
[2:10:14] neo_0098: is there going to be Ruby Sanctum in WOTLK Classic?
[2:10:18] Day_Walker78: Cata was good i think
[2:10:18] Rudric_Ice: remove LFR from classic cata and make raids easier
[2:10:21] sptheory: exactly keep wotlk realms
[2:10:22] CertifiableAndy: I'll keep playing classic until they merge mount collections to retail
[2:10:22] DovahChicken: Agree
[2:10:23] denflup: when did raids started to become really hard?
[2:10:24] Velashen: @felegolas agreed
[2:10:26] saulith: Get away with your classic cata, classic DF all the way!
[2:10:27] BodmassAD: My issue with "Cata Classic" is isn't all cata content still available in retail?
[2:10:27] Hekseez: LET ME STAY IN CATA
[2:10:28] Dutchstab: cata was awesome
[2:10:28] ItsUxorious: What if Blizzard released the old content, fixt the things people criticizedand upgraded the graphics, fights and challanges of that expansion - but stayed true to the story, setting etc....
[2:10:29] paddystar11: i personally started late BFA so i don't know all the old eras. But i would personally actually love to play Warlords / MoP classic, didnt like Vanilla to Wrath classic sadly
[2:10:31] Aethn: 1/3rd of EQ's subs are not TLP subs, Holly created a Gold mine with TLP's and is doing it for Blizzard now
[2:10:43] theoldgodmd: Hey @Towelliee, this is your long cousinr-in-law Eddie. I spoke with Lulaboo and she told me you could hook me up with a beta key. Feel free to shoot me a message. Btw, don't bother asking her as it's too early in the AM and she might be sleeping. See you at thanksgiving!
[2:10:44] Aethn: now
[2:10:50] Aspectt10: @Towelliee I think splitting the player base across 5 WoWs is a BAD idea
[2:10:50] Murray_2k6: i mean they can add some systems from cata like transmog to wotlk but they wont
[2:10:50] KyriaTheMystic: Yes please keep Wrath
[2:10:52] newkingcody: anything that isnt current retail is classic
[2:10:54] bypized: @Towelliee I see people asking that now a parallel timeline starts in Azeroth an era where Cataclysm never happened in Azeroth's lore
[2:10:55] Mecabeast: I've only heard a handful of things that people hated about cata like how difficult it was and messing up the world but all the zones and patches were great
[2:10:55] DisclaimerGG: I think Season of Mastery would be more fun in WotlK than it was with Vanilla
[2:10:55] Perseus_IRL: classic should be just for the first 3 expansion!
[2:10:58] Tripnbunz: Straight up don't lose these severs it will break my heart
[2:10:58] macieks2k: Cata pvp was so fun, but id love to see them do an osrs style build on classic
[2:10:58] Murray_2k6: without cata being released
[2:11:01] Wolfenhoof: I want housing in Northrend ScaredyCat
[2:11:01] Wigglyhunter: Hey @Towelliee, this is your long cousinr-in-law Eddie. I spoke with Lulaboo and she told me you could hook me up with a beta key. Feel free to shoot me a message. Btw, don't bother asking her as it's too early in the AM and she might be sleeping. See you at thanksgiving!
[2:11:03] bigb0ngrip: Is there someway that blizzard could take the same approach as Jagex did with old school runescape?
[2:11:03] Moobot: Giveaways will be done periodically in the channel during special events or #Ad content.
[2:11:03] neo_0098: is there going to be Ruby Sanctum in WOTLK Classic?
[2:11:03] tiralos_: Did I miss the keyword moment? *neckscratch*
[2:11:11] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee my idea was to do vanilla>BC>wrath progression, but with all the QOL from retail like RDF, transmog and better talents.
[2:11:13] fulcrum_262: I will refuse to play cata classic
[2:11:15] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:11:16] a_demeaning_cow: I love both versions of the game. I am disappointed that they are releasing both versions this year I feel like it‚Äôs going to split the player base to much. Especially for more casual players who don‚Äôt have time to do both
[2:11:16] newkingcody: cata is from 2010
[2:11:18] newkingcody: thats classic
[2:11:21] bypized: @Towelliee I see people asking that now a parallel timeline starts in Azeroth an era where Cataclysm never happened in Azeroth's lore. Thoughts?
[2:11:23] newkingcody: 12 year old expac
[2:11:26] DisclaimerGG: @neo_0098 Their current plan I believe is to release ruby sanc with ToC
[2:11:26] zenFX_: @DisclaimerGG SoM in wrath would be too much of a joke
[2:11:30] Grawbad: In my opinion, they should continue classic as what they have now.  Keep what they have now but start adding fresh start servers that are like Wow Remastered, and BC remastered, that kind of thing.  Imagine Classic WoW, before BC but remastered with flight to earn.  Remastered with better graphics.  New mobs. New dungeons.  But keep these as "Classic Remastered".  That is the way forward IMHO.
[2:11:31] Nightrox: LETSGO GUYS
[2:11:32] Honvar: Great, I need to leave in 10 minutese :D
[2:11:34] zenFX_: easy enough as it is
[2:11:37] Honvar: minutes*
[2:11:41] luckfore: towCopium just 10 more mins guys for sure
[2:11:42] OhNinjaPlease: classic Battlepets
[2:11:47] tiralos_: Yeyyy
[2:11:48] beladinhotv: !beta
[2:11:49] ChrisarN: pre patch in 4 weeks @towelliee ?
[2:11:49] lord_hanmint: Keyword? For beta key?
[2:11:50] Murray_2k6: watch them stop at mist Kappa
[2:11:54] r0b928: Yeah I‚Äôm confused why blizz did that. Why get rid of classic and then BC. Keep them separate so you can still go back and play them. What they did defeats the purpose of having them relaunched
[2:11:54] Rodorann: i dont want trees to change from wrath to cata
[2:11:55] lldeathlordll: @DisclaimerGG huh ? when did they say that
[2:12:05] ClutchKladdkaka: As long as people play they will keep going with classic. People are already spending their lives in WoW. Why not play two expansions at the same time forever. It will turn into three eventually. And son on. Thoughts?
[2:12:09] tumb_tack: If they could link mogs and mounts collected to retail.. I would play the shit out of stuff
[2:12:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: With a substantial amount of people playing Wrath private servers for years, it makes sense to keep Wrath going no matter what
[2:12:12] Phil87z: I don‚Äôt see them investing too much in classic plus because it‚Äôs all hands for retail
[2:12:15] okdude312: what if the studio they bought is specifically for classic wow lol
[2:12:17] TheBroCrow: Gimme classic with updated visuals and something like m+ and I'd be all over that shit
[2:12:18] OhNinjaPlease: Tbh, they should add Battlepets to classic, then I'll have a reason to play.
[2:12:19] newkingcody: and they still couldnt fix servers kekw
[2:12:19] saulith: honestly, a different timeline from azeroth would be sick
[2:12:20] Moobot:  Please visit towelliee.com to get caught up on all of the latest Youtube videos, Discord links, sponsor information and news/events that may be coming up in the stream!
[2:12:22] Inthezonewow: Small indie team PogChamp
[2:12:25] fulcrum_262: that would be great just go a different direction
[2:12:27] theoldgodmd: Hey @Towelliee, this is your long cousin-in-law Eddie. I spoke with Lulaboo and she told me you could hook me up with a beta key. Feel free to shoot me a message. Btw, don't bother asking her as it's too early in the AM and she might be sleeping. See you at thanksgiving!
[2:12:32] KyriaTheMystic: I'm forever hopium on one day getting playable Sethrak.
[2:12:33] newkingcody: thats all they had to do and they still let servers get rekt
[2:12:34] Mecabeast: like imagine vanilla remastered and played like retail classes but monks evoakers and demon hunters removed
[2:12:43] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee did you buy one of the server blades when classic came out
[2:12:44] lldeathlordll: @r0b928 ppl will abandon them and it will turn to a ghost city like SoM
[2:12:47] DisclaimerGG: @lldeathlordll If I remember it was in an old most they made. But it wasn't a 100% sure plan, just like the ilvl changes for ToC and Ulduar.
[2:12:49] Doomsmoothie: they should do Classic Wrath kidna like how OSRS is. Make new content for Wrath
[2:12:50] OhNinjaPlease: I have a neighbor named Eddie, hate that guy
[2:12:55] rhyswow: hey towilee whats your thoughts on thr changes this build
[2:12:57] Rudric_Ice: i would love that
[2:12:57] Grawbad: @Towelliee Did you see my last message?  I think that offers the best way forward.
[2:12:58] Vaprossa: It would be cool to get a key today, its my birthday!
[2:13:01] ChrisarN: am I the only one mega hyped for Dragonflight?
[2:13:05] bypized: Yeah, exactly
[2:13:08] Zilberg: No chance while Bobby is there
[2:13:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, making new content would require a full dev team with artists and everything
[2:13:11] ParzTV81: you saw it...he became anima
[2:13:16] tommosaurusrex: @ChrisarN no
[2:13:16] Scoodles91: oor, hear me out, just focus on retail and scrap classic :D
[2:13:17] luckfore: i want mop classic pls
[2:13:18] bypized: Just focusing on smaller stories
[2:13:19] Zombiestain: would draw in even more new players
[2:13:20] TheFiddlerDiddler: We did, it was Shadowlands
[2:13:20] Collected1: wait, extra content?
[2:13:23] Rudric_Ice: or what if Arthas actually killed us ALL
[2:13:24] OhNinjaPlease: I'm mega hyped for sure. @chrisarn
[2:13:26] Aethn: TLP's on EQ right now are nuts, they are experimenting with all kinds of crazy rules now.  The current one, Vaniki, is a server where you fight all the raid content, but 10 levels below the original with Account wide rewards if you kill the bosses

[2:13:43] Weelad_x: am i the only who like doesnt hear/see noise about dragonflight
[2:13:48] OhNinjaPlease: yeah I don't want classic to get a branch off
[2:13:52] bypized: And Blizzard will be making money! LUL
[2:13:58] KronasKG: ooooo if they did it they could follow a story line where Garrosh dies in the wrath conflict.... completely re writes what happened
[2:14:00] SirRhubarb: LUL
[2:14:00] lord_hanmint: !keys
[2:14:00] newkingcody: randys stand up
[2:14:02] ShabsieAU: as a randy, i dont care really, candies can be happy with their stuff
[2:14:04] theoldgodmd: why upset? it would be like having two different mmo's i see no problem
[2:14:05] Murray_2k6: towel are you afraid of burnout if you play df beta all the way?
[2:14:07] holyrs: Cata PVP was the best
[2:14:09] Maverick_Made: Blizzard has a lot to catch up on they been milking us for years but I'm a simp for dragons, always have been - keen to be one, ride one etc
[2:14:13] thougooseberry: What's a randy :(
[2:14:16] fulcrum_262: candys and randys lol üòÜ
[2:14:16] lane7295: they did arthas dirty in shadowlands
[2:14:17] Subjektive: classic branching off is like having a MMO competing with retail its not a good idea
[2:14:17] OhNinjaPlease: because then I'll feel bad for not starting at the beginning of Classic
[2:14:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard can make a lot of money, and they should if they are producing good content that people enjoy
[2:14:24] WhiteKnight74648: Crandy?
[2:14:26] SLoPPYALieN: "Yeah, Baby!" - Austin Powers
[2:14:30] lldeathlordll: @holyrs you sure mate ? Mop no?/
[2:14:33] ItsUxorious: I think i should get the key - just because i was out on a nightclub the other day and had to go to the toilet doing nr2... .i was a bit sick so - lits just say everything was flowing out on this toilet in the club... then suddanly someone knocked the door in and puked all over me.. .and before i could even onderstand what was happening (i was drunk) - he hit me in the face and knocked me out. ....
[2:14:33] bypized: imagine they branch off and focus on smaller scope stories that are not huge lore expansions and stuff
[2:14:34] Zombiestain: is there any extra loot?
[2:14:38] Rudric_Ice: im done with shadowlands lol
[2:14:42] Mecabeast: huntsman nearly dcd me lol

[2:14:46] togopan: it made myhic sludgefist super fun and fast

[2:15:34] Grawbad: @Towelliee What I am proposing, is NOT getting rid of Classic WoW, but adding new "Classic Remastered" servers for fun.  Its classic but with new graphics and draw distances.  New dungeon to take on outside of what is already there. The ability to earn flight and continually updated it with new things but leaving the core alone.
[2:15:45] holyrs: unpopular opinion , people in classic are more toxic than people in retail

[3:34:48] TheItalianStallion321: i actually hope they dont put in the RFD.... i really dont want my social experience ruined.....HAHAHAHAHHA fuck that shit
[3:34:49] alabranches: I think Dungeon Finder it's fine. Every morden mmo has it. The problem is that blizz just stopped to care about world content
[3:34:52] lldeathlordll: KEKW
[3:34:54] djexxc: lol
[3:34:57] Demanisraar: pikaOMG
[3:34:58] actually_pierce: clip it
[3:35:05] Animemron: I met alot of people by forming groups without the LFD. BUT back then people werent as elitist as they are now. You werent expected to have heroic gear to join a normal dungeon.
[3:35:10] ÊóãÈ£éÈ°µÂç∑Â≠ê: ohno lfr in wotlk  PepeWhy
[3:35:11] HaloS23: @GamingDad77 agreed!
[3:35:12] paddystar11: @rivellana ya i feel like shadowlands was so insanely alt-unfriendly mmos live by people who create more than 1 class. Stuff like dominiation sockets is the worst case i have ever experienced. But also cosmic flux should have been accountwide day 1 honestly
[3:35:15] DisclaimerGG: If they really want you to explore the world just make people discover the dungeon before they can queue for it. ez fix
[3:35:17] JOEadelphia: pkmnChu
[3:35:17] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[3:35:20] sptheory: but its not same, pve you can use LFG chat, as PVP you cant do that hence to queue from anywhere is good for PvP content
[3:35:21] cFitzzz: I can't wait for the same people who wanted it removed, start whining and raging that it needs to be implemented
[3:35:22] Shurn_82: @Fafnyir there is a BTTV pause scrolling option I used when I modded ;)
[3:35:27] Ant9912: Even using the in game one they have now, id prefer a SERVER based Dungeon finder than what they have now
[3:35:27] Anzel_1: Literally everyone wants you to be fully geared right at 70
[3:35:29] Jynt334: Why in the world do Assassination Rogues have both Shiv and Shadowstep in both the Rogue Tree and the Assassination Tree
[3:35:31] Shrenko: midmaxing meta ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:35:36] hickey7979: @moobot link dont work

[3:35:45] Zvishfake1: Zvishfake1 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:35:45] Zvishfake1: Zvishfake1 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:36:01] LeDerpski: @Jynt334 Extra charges I would assume
[3:36:05] jasperboy: @Shurn_82 I use it, but sometimes it bugs out and chat keeps scrolling
[3:36:19] Zomgboy: Socialize= Summon
[3:36:21] GrazzloTV: blizz holding their stance on not implementing lfd gives off shadowlands covenants not being swapable at the launch vibes
[3:36:23] TheItalianStallion321: and you still have 1 dc for like 10 minutes
[3:36:25] amricatt: @TSMballer Sunken Temple
[3:36:25] jhopps12: the amount of "H MGT Shard HR" run I've seen from DK's in the last couple wweeks is insane lol
[3:36:31] jasperboy: SNIPED
[3:36:33] Anzel_1: I dont like spending 30 mins rn trying to find a group for MGT heroic its kind of a pain lol
[3:36:35] sparklegem99: id kick that guy and get another one lmao
[3:36:36] Shurn_82: @jasperboy use HOLD PUSH not toggle and it should be ok

[3:36:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[3:36:54] sipsac: shit, i play eq.. always did. It's dumb. RDF should be there.
[3:37:06] Crudler1: that is long gone now
[3:37:08] Axyorix: I was in Jeff Kaplan's (Tigole) guild in Everquest..... I have stories lol
[3:37:09] HonestPhilosophy: You can only use rdf if you share one fun fact about yourself
[3:37:18] Anzel_1: just do shit with your guild imo
[3:37:22] sparklegem99: ive played everquest emu servers for years. slam the RDF already
[3:37:28] lalelusa: the game is doomed, then
[3:37:29] g4rlox: do he give more keys away today?
[3:37:44] Shrenko: did you see New World added 7 new servers this week @Towelliee
[3:37:47] Animemron: @Towelliee exactly. Times have changed. A LFD would have been the way to go for wrath classic.
[3:37:48] Amarlian: Are you trying to tell me the best way to socialize with other players is join a guild? That's crazy talk! @Towelliee
[3:37:48] GamingDad77: @a_rtt yes. be patient
[3:37:51] Pty_Navaja: !beta

[3:38:04] PanoramicPanda: 20 minutes into Classic launch years ago, I was all "Oh man, you were right. I didn't want this. Give me my convenience stuff back."
[3:38:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: I wanted automated guilds to help people do things together
[3:38:05] ObsidianHealer: Yep
[3:38:10] Amarlian: I remember that with Swotr
[3:38:10] duutjaa: New world just had it yes ;)
[3:38:13] quju_: im a fan of the new expedition finder makes spamming runs enjoyable
[3:38:25] belgorm: Are you going to try the update to New World?
[3:38:29] kARMApangYa: Had a lot of fun fighting you guys with Dara Mactire in SwTor
[3:38:32] xmirrxrs: I just want level characters by spaming dungeons
[3:38:35] joeyshades101: This is the social aspect of the game in dungeons: player 1: Yo player 2: yo player 3: yo player 4: yo player 5: yo
[3:38:37] Meowzamere: @c0mmander_starscream your arms wiggle a little now XD, but ya still sink
[3:38:45] Alepouditsa: yep we talk in guild chat or dicord if we raid
[3:38:47] sponx: Early 2000s internet was completely different
[3:38:51] Velashen: Look at world content in GW2. It‚Äôs solo but but finds ways to be social naturally. Tons fighting world bosses and meta events.
[3:38:51] GamingDad77: I would say more Discord than guilds.
[3:38:54] Felldoh_: Dungeon finder is definitely the way to go. I do not miss the days playing Vanilla/BC where you wait for 2 hrs to get a group, and then someone leaves... so much wasted time.
[3:38:55] Ophirin: We would use Ventrillo for Guild Raids
[3:38:55] moofia1980: did you get your classquest for sunken temple , toweliee
[3:38:56] Amarlian: We had to talk to other people in the world because we didn't know the game
[3:39:00] Alepouditsa: but old raids danKEK
[3:39:00] c0mmander_starscream: This is not my "Grand Papi's" MMO time I want convenience
[3:39:04] jhopps12: It'd be like trying to use a flip phone out of nostalgia cause it is what you grew up with. makes no sense, innovation is a good thing
[3:39:13] alabranches: @joeyshades101 and "do u need that" when something drops
[3:39:17] CodeFzero: Classic sometimes feels like a love letter to retail convenience

[3:39:29] moofia1980: cool cool
[3:39:35] 06DGR: from my experience im the opposite, ive been binge playing WoTLK Pre Patch and im always getting whispers and im always whispering people for info or help
[3:39:36] Felldoh_: The social aspect of wow is just external to the game now, with people socializing other places
[3:39:36] Amarlian: I feel they should have had some servers that didnt have dungeon finder and a few with. then you choose @Towelliee
[3:39:36] davecoia: First time seeing the stream, love the HUD setup and your background :)
[3:39:44] Holysal: @Alepouditsa ppl like the easier raid. tbc vs shadowlands proved that
[3:39:47] ParzTV81: the stone tells u
[3:39:48] actually_pierce: Didn't they remove level requirements from stones in WotLK? @Towelliee
[3:39:48] duutjaa: 47-52
[3:39:51] 06DGR: i rarely use discord or anything
[3:39:52] Madarathegawd: alot of there's but my social experience people are huffing this biggest amount of copium
[3:39:52] sipsac: hover over the stone, it tells you
[3:39:53] Inthezonewow: You also get less XP if the mobs are grey for anyone. Its an antiboost mechanic @Towelliee
[3:39:53] Korupcija_: easy replace

[3:40:00] Madarathegawd: these
[3:40:01] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee I've encountered a few "sprouts" in wrath classic who whispered me to stop so they could inspect my warlock talents and asked me how I like warlock.
[3:40:17] GamingDad77: Most guilds nowadays rarely use Guild chat. Everyone uses Discord
[3:40:20] Wolfenhoof: Guilds... aren't that these things with... people? ScaredyCat
[3:40:25] neo_0098: Where is Everlook located?

[3:44:52] Shrenko: BRD AoE runs is insane EXP @Towelliee
[3:44:56] Nauticca: For this UI, are we using your TBC Classic compilation?

[3:46:56] TyteeLive: which dungeon is this
[3:46:58] TooLock: I want mop over Cata
[3:47:01] cFitzzz: Cata should be mostly the same other than starting to do Classic+ and drive it with Community input a la OSRS
[3:47:07] TooLock: Mop is the best expantion ever
[3:47:07] alabranches: The only good think about cata was goblins
[3:47:10] Pike_man: I cant wait for Shadowlands Classic.
[3:47:12] nezz231: I have not played a single classic yet but mop I would play all day for sure

[3:49:50] Llendorphin: Draenor was the best 3months of wow, spread over 2 years :)
[3:49:50] pent217: They praise it because the raids were absolutely top tier
[3:49:50] Gutroan: Draenor setting was the best setting though
[3:49:50] Demanisraar: Raids where good in Draenor, that is all
[3:49:50] TheRiwen: I did like WOD

[3:49:52] Masqerader: The raids were good, the dungeons were good, after that it was pointless
[3:49:52] cFitzzz: naw not unless it involved cut content
[3:49:52] CaptainPhatty: WoD without the content drought might hit different
[3:49:54] alabranches: If they did a express WoD it would be fine
[3:49:54] okdude312: theme was amazing, but they'll need to add a brand-new phase
[3:49:54] Robodope: i'm gonna make so much gold from my garrison alts in draenor classic
[3:49:55] Anzel_1: that'll make everyone play it
[3:49:55] HardBenis: Draenor was a good leveling experience
[3:49:56] lucidakamaze: Dreanor is alot better than Shadowlands tho.
[3:49:57] Scoodles91: half a year expansion
[3:50:03] alabranches: Like a 6 mounth WoD
[3:50:04] CajunCrusader: They could always release the scrapped patch from WoD
[3:50:04] ayrisen: Unless they added content that was cut
[3:50:05] Velashen: Selfie Cam content patch. Good times.
[3:50:08] CodeFzero: I leveled in dranor with an alt was fun but I remembered nothing about it lol
[3:50:13] Baldarsar: the should stop with Wrath !!!!
[3:50:14] Anzel_1: I thought challenge modes were fun

[3:50:33] rabidwargamer: Maybe do WoD, with all the cut content LUL
[3:50:37] GamingDad77: discount... LUL LUL
[3:50:38] dngrslythicc: give us $15 a month to play WoD
[3:50:39] lalelusa: But by the time Draenor Classic came around, Microsoft might give us a discount
[3:50:40] HagermanHour: discount draenor LUL
[3:50:47] Jumpity: classic WoD with mission table gold machine and the introduction of wow tokens into classic?
[3:50:50] ScuffedGnome: I loved the pvp zone they had in WOD spent hours in that
[3:50:55] Axyorix: WoD was when the power struggle between Addon Makers and adding in more and more mechanics to raids started
[3:50:58] ScrubbzTV: for the low price of 59.98 lol
[3:51:02] Anzel_1: wow will be on game pass by then and you get to play for 1 dollar special !!
[3:51:14] Glynn11: I started draenor towards the end of the expac and absolutely loved it, but I didn't suffer from the content draught
[3:51:17] onous_: Blizzards idea of a discount is jacking the price up then taking 80% of and giving it to you at the original price.
[3:51:21] Axyorix: Exorsus Raid Tools literally put an overlay ont he screen telling you where to stand for some Mythic Fights
[3:51:26] tiralos_: Not me running around all the different key streams and twitter stuff like a mad man today towSweat
[3:51:27] Masqerader: Everytime I think of Draenor I think of the damn ring and link it to LOTR  "One ring to ruin them all, and in the darkness annoy them"

[4:05:05] ThQbi: Is the wow release normaly on monday?
[4:05:05] Connectus: He's right, I have 0 doubts. The pre-patch PTR launch lines up with an October pre-patch on the date mentioned in the leak (can't reach it from the top of my mind)
[4:05:24] Connectus: Also the pre-patch launch dates is 4 weeks before the supposed launch. 4 weeks is standard for pre-patch
[4:05:31] Connectus: I have 0 doubts it's real because of that
[4:05:31] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.

[4:06:11] Connectus: @holtrop hold on, let me search it as my mind is fried atmo
[4:06:33] lalelusa: Arclight RUmble wasn't included in the leak, though. Curious to see when that releases
[4:06:34] KridenTagg: That's always my biggest frustration.  Releasing Classic and Retail so close to each other is a real bummer.  Wrath is what I was really waiting for in the Classic realm.
[4:06:39] holtrop: ah right 25 oct makes sense because the leaked release date was 28 november if im correct
[4:06:48] Connectus: 25 October pre-patch and 28 november expansion launch @holtrop
[4:06:54] losttemple1989: Is any who got the dragonflight bera key
[4:07:20] neo_0098: leveling in wrath is even slower without the dungeon finder :(

[4:07:39] AzureaFrost: @lalelusa in the discord the devs have mentioned a soft launch so If I had to guess in the next few months they will launch in early access or something

[4:11:55] Moobot: Giveaways will be done periodically in the channel during special events or #Ad content.
[4:12:04] lldeathlordll: @kingkafro it is, i said kinda not it's 100% dead, most of my friends or everyone i knew got a break until DF or went to classic until DF
[4:12:08] Blackicedragoon: Retail is dead and Blizzard needs a WIN
[4:12:12] Scandeless: and they banking they dont care
[4:12:14] TheGiant99: why wait for wrath classic....go play it now the content is there
[4:12:18] noobopl: VoHiYo VoHiYo
[4:12:38] Krue_Sr: Retail is far from dead
[4:12:39] Furretz: @Moobot what is considered a special event  or ad content? :P
[4:12:46] GrazzloTV: i've seen a few renditions of the warrior and paladin talents so far and they've been good
[4:12:49] devotedx: irrelvant im not stopping wrath for it
[4:12:50] jhopps12: I wouldn't say retail is dead, Season 4 was solid. People are just taking a break until DF to play classic and it's ok to take a short break from games
[4:12:52] brian_777777777: that maw music
[4:12:56] Vuruca: I was hoping they didn‚Äôt raid test like ffvix and the most recent raid

[4:13:18] Bear: Dragon riding looks like so much fun
[4:13:19] XerciusGaming: True. I think the lack of borrowed power systems might also be helping to avoid crunch. They must take so much work
[4:13:21] Mitchiegan: portal time
[4:13:22] TheGiant99: @devotedx you can play full wrath now
[4:13:26] Holysal: @Krue_ everyone is waiting for 10.0. theres still players but def a downward swing
[4:13:29] GSCHLICK92: Can you test talents on PTR or only Beta?
[4:13:32] Crudler1: yeah great fun isn't it lol
[4:13:33] TheItalianStallion321: @lane7295 if i had to guess? probably not
[4:13:34] SpookyB_ttv: the two fated powers make the bosses a joke now
[4:13:39] r0b928: It‚Äôs cause they gave up on shadowlands and worked on dragon isles

[6:00:08] antwan2016: negativity bias
[6:00:12] warrenny: @ademi_tv Content gets cut from every game

[6:00:14] odawgxd: Draenor start of exp was the best ever dont at me

[6:01:27] Xugodx2012: Speedy Boi
[6:01:29] odawgxd: The zones in WoD are probably the best made ever. Sooo good. The problem was the garrison and the content draught. Except from that, dungeons and raids were amazing.
[6:01:30] luckfore: legon was the GOAT
[6:01:31] NotsofatTheGamer: @Towelliee if u had to choose only one to come back - MoP or Legion classic
[6:01:36] WhiteKnight74648: I thought you said Karen on a stick
[6:01:39] skymercii: @Deku_Scrub0 i disagree  Cata Feral PvP was Chefs Kiss

[6:04:34] azirum: I don't think they will do a Classic+ or an "alternate universe" style version. They Ultima fear it would pull players from Retail. Classic is free with a sub, their driving product is Retail.
[6:04:47] Pight314: lol adds are adds its the price we pay to not be bored lool

[6:05:31] Xailen: cata classic will show them they are going to farr
[6:05:39] Sharknad0: No dungeon finder = bad. No LFR = good
[6:05:39] thisisstupidwtf420: This is the first stream I have ever really watched aside from Mythic Races and I gotta say this is a pretty good time. I like this dude
[6:05:42] dpquig: they really should just end at wrath classic
[6:05:43] Thazzua: towByah
[6:05:43] Mourningztar: I just hate that it feels like they re-releasing everything
[6:05:56] CritcobainTV: I think cataclysm was a good expansion. The only bad part was it was when LFR released and the quest revamp was fuckin weird, but other than that the content was great
[6:05:57] DaazzTV: DaazzTV subscribed with Prime. 
[6:05:58] Prisana: Hey can you show how to change seals on pally power addon
[6:06:02] Thralazaar: what alternative to cata would you suggest? adding content to wrath or classic kinda thing?
[6:06:08] boosh1337: how many entries have I missed?
[6:06:11] azirum: @pandamoniumv2 Classic is not free, more of a bonus. they get more money off Retail from micro and expac sales.
[6:06:15] luckfore: wrath is the last classic, in cata the world etc changed and its no longer classic
[6:06:15] WonderMog: honestly. I figured if they went to cata classic, they'd wheel back aroind to vanilla after
[6:06:15] owlshark: does the honor continue to wotlk or will the honor reset?

[6:06:20] razledazle1337: @PandamoniumV2 Blizz is the only company who, that has done "Classic" version of the game, has looped in the classic version with the primary sub
[6:06:22] ChunkOLicious: i was really hoping that classic would release cut content for the expansions
[6:06:25] Choraz: i socialized more with rdf and lfr so removal of it is fudged imno
[6:06:28] CritcobainTV: should send it to everyone actively plays classic
[6:06:31] brian_777777777: they dont care Sadge
[6:06:31] azirum: I would rather them Do classic and add new content such as cut raids.
[6:06:31] MouraPlay: Did the third giveaway happened?
[6:06:34] pytnzp: End it with wrath. we do not need to re live all of this. it was cool 15 years ago not now. focus the energy on making the live game perfect
[6:06:36] Thebestbubbles: I think it is just silly to remove quality of life stuff, especially since most people just add those things back in with mods
[6:06:41] therealwolfernix: not yet
[6:06:45] gurkalicious: Wouldn't that be giving it to a biased population
[6:06:46] Xiodrade: I got the survey and I don't play classic
[6:06:49] Xugodx2012: Ready for them Guild Perks again in Cata Classic :)
[6:06:49] Ezmaraldaa: give it to players that actually played it and still sub lol
[6:06:50] MILESkg21: SOON‚Ñ¢
[6:06:52] owlshark: does the honor continue to wotlk or will the honor reset?
[6:06:52] luckfore: let us vote
[6:06:57] sacraletv: they put it out there, it gets leaked, then they see the real response
[6:06:59] Sollice: Maybe the classic teams sends it to a limited amount of people so it scews their % and they get a higher yes % and it validates their job lol
[6:07:02] TheSpace_Sloth: @ChunkOLicious we all were and I think that would have been the smart thing to do. Maybe if they don't do Cata they would consider it.
[6:07:03] Sollice: #fuckclassic

[6:07:10] xhale2nhale: I find it funny folks always say some dumb crap like aClassic+ or w.e will take retail players, stop with stupid comments n mindset like that
[6:07:14] WonderMog: @chunkolicious that would be awesome actually. look to do the cut content in the past
[6:07:15] Frogger1314: @ChunkOLicious If cata classic came, I dare Blizz to release the unfinished Vashjr raid
[6:07:16] razledazle1337: @pytnzp You know there are Multiple teams right??? one team Specifically for Classic content, and one for specific for live/retail/new expansions etc, probably multiple different teams
[6:07:23] Gravity16: How do we enter just by watching ?
[6:07:32] SLoPPYALieN: "long term retail" Not new to WoW now retail.

[6:08:11] Sollice: @boosh1337 Just for saying this you will not win. Go talk to your therapists i made the decision for you
[6:08:11] Drgashingtons: Wotlk *
[6:08:19] pytnzp: @pytnzp Yeah, but could be cool to see full force on a live game. We could get new patches every 3 months, would be sick
[6:08:20] lldeathlordll: @pytnzp it's your opinion, they are ppl that miss expansions like mop or legion
[6:08:21] Producedbyryku: whens the giveaway
[6:08:23] Orrog: I think a lot of people's issue with cata was that it wasn't wrath

[6:08:59] Thralazaar: cata heroics and raids on launch were roughhh
[6:09:09] SozoKratos: preferred the ability to do 10 and 25 man raids in wrath - went away in cata
[6:09:12] azirum: @xhale2nhale it's not the player mindset. it's blizzards. the C level folks don't see classic as a serious product. they see retail as the cash cow. they want retail to have better numbers. it's why FFXIV started scaring them.
[6:09:13] razledazle1337: @tonightxiv The 3rd one will happen Soon(TM)(TM)

[6:49:35] Prisana: Are you still gonna use elbui
[6:49:37] luckfore: this is wrath classic guys LUL
[6:49:44] SilkeySmooth: flag guards,elites and players drop armor scraps
[6:49:49] digitard: Yeah, I love ElvUI personally for the ease to move every single aspect
[6:49:49] borisl0vehammer: North mine is now alliance, you could cap it now
[6:49:51] Ademi_tv: I had to step out briefly, did i miss the giveaway?
[6:49:55] digitard: Plus I've tuned it JUST how i like it
[6:49:55] cipusanx: rocket ui
[6:49:55] CodyKane: Elvui is the bee's knees
[6:50:03] Honvar: @Ademi_tv Yes
[6:50:14] urielchars: Yeah 100% elvui, but for a new player the new UI is a massive improve over what we had before
[6:50:30] SilkeySmooth: you have to zerg the mine at the start and kill mine boss
[6:50:35] ExanimisGG: wait u r telling us u can't solo kill army of alliance players? Kappa :tf:
[6:50:35] dreamwalker213: for someone who only really uses bartender im so hyped to get rid of that shit

[6:51:22] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[6:51:25] digitard: if you want to tune it ElvUI is still my prefernece since you can move every single aspect anywhere piece by piece... especially if you have an Ultrawide display and have more horizontal real estate you can use
[6:51:36] Kinghorn: time to take the high road and sneak to the mine
[6:51:42] Kinghorn: or the low road
[6:51:48] luchion09: LUL LUL LUL

[6:52:19] happybooger: the Grim Reaper cometh... for your ass towOof
[6:52:38] urielchars: Doesn't mean the Default UI won't get to the same level of customization tho
[6:52:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like the default UI and this Dragonflight ojne is awesome
[6:52:44] TweektheProphet: 3rd person mode in COD
[6:52:48] urielchars: Not anytime soon ofc
[6:52:50] jerseyfive: elvui configuration is scary
[6:52:55] TheRiwen: I like the ui we have now
[6:52:57] xion_h: I love the functionality of ElvUI, but that being said the amount of issues Ive had with ElvUI and performance drops in raid which vanish when I turn it off wont be missed.
[6:53:00] Collected1: #DefaultUIGang
[6:53:02] nclemen24: @towelliee you need to use more hammer of fck your face
[6:53:12] digitard: LOL they could just buy it from the Takui site... problem solved
[6:53:13] MILESkg21: it would cost us an EXPANSION
[6:53:14] Alendar_: yea nah they wouldn't get to ElvUI for a WHILE lol
[6:53:21] Lucrom: Ye they need to work to do that :P
[6:53:24] Prisana: Ive used default ui since i started playing wow i tried elvui and i just cant get used to it.. it bugs me out
[6:53:27] Alendar_: the settings for your raid frames alone are probably 8x the new default
[6:53:28] digitard: Especially if they get Microsoft money soon... just buy ElvUI and incorporate it
[6:53:41] Alienfromger: thats to much for casual players tho LUL
[6:53:46] jerseyfive: it would be too much, keep it simple

[6:54:30] Fuzziew: Silly PVP brains and their default UI's lol
[6:54:36] xion_h: Im 100% dropping it and using default for frames and bars then hiding them for weakura ui
[6:54:48] Kinghorn: cobaltHMM
[6:54:59] digitard: @TheHoboWithAShotgun it would take way more than a week... remember they can't just snag ElvUI so they'd have to do their own.   Probably a few months to get it working through PTR testing and such.
[6:55:04] Mecabeast: ui is more for mdi and awc players because of tourney realm restrictions for addons
[6:55:14] amricatt: I've used default UI since Vanilla.  I don't take to change well.  LOL

[6:57:38] CritcobainTV: @Prisana do itt
[6:57:40] TheSpace_Sloth: @Towelliee they would get mass reported if they were not with the zerg or max level and then banned
[6:57:43] dreamwalker213: dk's were getting banned for just doing quests and not "participating" to level 61-70

[7:12:45] caffeinecomplex: Do you have to interact with anything to get beta or does it work like most others where it just shows up in your twitch account?
[7:12:56] urielchars: I mean there is some Key Account Managers that are crap at their job, must suck to be in that situation and not have a person that actually wants to help

[7:14:55] 91Niki: You do NOT need to be subbed to opt into the beta
[7:14:58] Lunaraies: @Collected1 Aha okay! I've been opt'd in since it opened and haven't gotten it yet haha
[7:14:59] dschmidt: I opt in and been easy dodging beta waves for 10yrs

[7:15:22] TheItalianStallion321: @91Niki are you sure about that? i think if you are not subbed, i think your chances are lower. i could be wrong
[7:15:29] Koanid: I think it's a pity that there are no German streamers. I don't understand English and need help with google.
[7:15:30] Collected1: Lunaraies : yeah same. and I've gotten into every expansion test previously. Just gotta be patient.
[7:15:32] happybooger: @riccolodeon no, that doesnt matter
[7:15:33] akaari5486: Im on beta,and people just use that as early access and complain about broken stuff,LITERALLY.It drives me insane

[7:16:09] ChumbaWumba6943: pretty sure only beta i got was legion, and i cant remember if it was from a key or if i got lucky
[7:16:11] TheRealXaarius: with blizzard im the fat kid who gets picked last every beta lol
[7:16:13] Retiosanti: I got beta for Shadowlands, BFA, and Legion, but not DF (yet)
[7:16:13] almostkoala: !beta
[7:16:17] Tyldorx: Sadge I wanna play beta so bad
[7:16:23] biohazard1935: ive been in every alpha and beta since launch of wow and this is the first one i never got in lol maybe cause i was gone for a year? lol
[7:16:24] BeeboBiggins: that was bobby kottick LMAO
[7:16:26] AndroidPuka: it says on the website you need to be subbed to WoW to be eligible for beta so lol
[7:16:26] Collected1: 91Niki : *Accounts must have an active World of Warcraft subscription or game time to be eligible for beta access selection.
[7:16:39] TheItalianStallion321: @Collected1 thats what i thought....
[7:16:45] thenotoriousmadmike: #aspectpower
[7:16:49] 91Niki: @Collected1 Not sure where you see that, but it never said anything like that when I opted in
[7:17:01] Hyrja: @91Niki "Accounts must have an active World of Warcraft subscription or game time to be eligible for beta access selection."
[7:17:01] Collected1: It's at the bottom of this page: https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/world-of-warcraft/23841482/the-world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-beta-test-begins-today

[7:17:24] MILESkg21: *Accounts must have an active World of Warcraft subscription or game time to be eligible for beta access selection. LMAO WHAT KEKW
[7:17:26] Hyrja: @Collected1 she probably missed that part
[7:17:33] 91Niki: I guess they changed that since last beta ijpSHRUG
[7:17:38] Collected1: I've seen a bunch of people claim they got invited on non-subbed accounts so who knows.
[7:17:54] TheItalianStallion321: i knew you needed a sub for beta access
[7:17:59] Zucchey: It the first time it has been like this
[7:18:05] 91Niki: @Towelliee I didn't have either when I get a beta invite last time around ijpSHRUG

[7:18:18] smashwow: that's new
[7:18:24] 91Niki: That's definitely new
[7:18:26] Mecabeast: why would you want beta and not be subbed already?
[7:18:26] AndroidPuka: @Ritz_McCracker they've been working on this stuff for a really long time so it's mostly tweaking things from what I understand. this was the fastest alpha/beta test phase I've ever seen so it seems like most everything is finished and it's been staggered in over the last couple of months
[7:18:30] ExanimisGG: @ymgsoap keep it and we will keep the key KEKW
[7:18:37] TheItalianStallion321: @91Niki possibly they have changed it from the past? i dont know

[7:48:03] Azerox050: i always roll fotm every season
[7:48:04] thrax_wod: @Towelliee thank you for all that great content <3
[7:48:04] jace2010: D:
[7:48:08] Mildead: Don't you think the new m+ sysytem is going to influence the meta, for example like not having the dragonflight dungeon with your BiS in the current season pool ?
[7:48:14] whodaboss_: Meta is a flase opinion created by the community
[7:48:16] Azerox050: ez keys

[7:49:58] thrax_wod: You most likely got asked often so far, but whats your opinion on the evoker healer? you think its worth switching away from my druid heal the first time since classic?
[7:50:09] whodaboss_: Meta is created by the community. They create this by the top 5% people (such as max) giving their 2 cents about what classes they want to bring. People hang onto 1 small niche thing they can do better than others and then say "thats the class im bringing to raid" that translates to the community as "this is whats best or your shit"
[7:50:40] JediNeo99999: @whodaboss_ Not entirely. Bear is objectively worse than bdk right now bu a decent amount
[7:50:40] whodaboss_: There is no differance between a prot warrior and a blood dk right now in the current game
[7:50:50] whodaboss_: The differance is the amount of skill required to play each
[7:50:51] Quojin: @whodaboss_ please dude jst drop it

[7:50:54] mavericks312: every casual mage is most likely using firedups specs lol
