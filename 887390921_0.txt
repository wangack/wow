[1:52:19] RocketMan23: @Angerina so for example with disc priest shield it helps prevent taking up front damage, whereas holy has to react to chunk damage

[1:55:10] flentcher: @Towelliee I was the priest i had to pee
[1:55:14] bobmcfob: @Djulio would be nice, but i feel like it would turn toxic
[1:55:20] CritcobainTV: Vek'nilash KEKW that's the problem
[1:55:30] CritcobainTV: hes one of 3people ont he realm
[1:55:34] Buzzz_Light_Beer: Pee emergency
[1:55:37] fearxj: people that leave when the key isn't dead are delusionals
[1:55:54] L4dy_Renegade: There's like 3 people on the realm. LUL
[1:55:59] assman_ny: Like the only guy on it, so he owns it
[1:56:03] Djulio: you could use data from combat log to prove the people were in the group with that person
[1:56:04] yunggluten: I started on Vek'nilash back in like 2007. It's a dead server now
[1:56:21] CritcobainTV: @fearxj I've left keys when we wipe like 5 or 6 times to the first 2 trash packs. I don't wanan sit in a key for an hour in a 12 :(
[1:56:22] Peepoblink: yes
[1:56:28] warrenny: @fearxj Or when your not timing they’re scum
[1:56:29] vanillabeansprout: Depends
[1:56:33] Gruffian: Who really looks at IO and looks for depletes.
[1:56:33] vanillabeansprout: Depends on your previous time
[1:56:40] Tabarat_TV: yes but you get more points for timing it
[1:56:44] flentcher: @Towelliee i once did a theater 12 in 1,25 hours
[1:56:46] JimMaker: Yes, but a grey wording doesnt look that good :D
[1:56:48] Armdel: depleted gives relatively low score
[1:56:50] Tabarat_TV: u get min points for it and the lvl
[1:56:50] fearxj: yeah but in your case the dungeon was still timable, i can understand when timer is rip but that one wasn't yet

[2:16:35] xFrxturePanda: Easy maze add on use MOTSH on curse you just click the ones that you see on each post then it announces which is right in game chat very simple to use
[2:16:51] SlayerLightStorm: @droopydorf Same. Did a Halls of Atonement Heroic run earlier on my Hunter, NO LOOT. WHATSOEVER.

[2:18:10] JackHealMe: "SL COULD BE BETTER IF... " - All healers had an interrupt & mass Dispell. Change my mind
[2:18:25] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Blizzard should've kept the drop rates where they were, should NOT have nerfed them like they did.
[2:18:31] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: a kick as a heal would be nice...really
[2:18:46] fenrel_01: I'm liking SL as much as I did Wrath.
[2:18:47] woody879: blizzard could pay us to play o_O

[2:19:51] Bacon_21: the dream? they'd just pay in honor points 4Head
[2:19:52] Amarlian: Mine is simple and biased. More Rewards from Torghast (something anything even Anima) and Flight Master Whistle...
[2:20:20] illuzion33x: @Amarlian we won't be getting flight master whistle flying will be out in 9.1
[2:20:31] Metket: amz in the middle of nowhere LUL
[2:20:38] Crazyjuniot: I think we are just to good at the game that we do content to fast and get bored quick
[2:20:39] casualboomer: I feel like people have gotten enough gear at this point that they don't take prideful seriously
[2:20:55] Amarlian: I know... @illuzion33x but that is still a few? Months away. Maybe some more flight points could be nice too
[2:21:02] SlayerLightStorm: @illuzion33x Yup, they complain and hate just to complain and hate. Those people can find something else to do. Find love or something.
[2:21:16] Amarlian: though even with flying, I still used the whistle @illuzion33x
[2:21:23] syriusqt: what addon are you using for frames?

[2:22:07] I_DoctorSatan_I: I had a Ret Pally rage quit on a MISTS+12 this morning within the maze mobs. Just left us after we wiped b/c of Spiteful + mobs up and it was our FIRST wipe. We had to 4 man Mistcaller > mobs > last boss. What a total shitbag. But hey, got the weekly GV in tho. LUL
[2:22:13] theoriginalzinng: if people die they probably stood in shit anyhow
[2:22:16] casualboomer: @zulway laughs in two toons 210+ LUL I tank dude. DPS that are bad at dungeon mechanics are getting carried hard enough that they get into higher keys now
[2:22:17] Madnezz123: whats the max renown atm?
[2:22:22] Crazyjuniot: 26
[2:22:30] Amarlian: ElvUI @syriusqt for frames. Plater for the enemy bars
[2:22:44] othraerir: maybe they can't see it
[2:22:46] moejimbo: RoP is stranger danger
[2:22:51] Metket: @Towelliee with that extra pull at the beginning of the maze you can pride last boss without extra packs after the boss
[2:22:52] othraerir: oh the ring
[2:22:59] casualboomer: @Towelliee you knew this was coming after corruption went away. All the weak M+ players that corruption made up for are exposed now
[2:23:00] blvdxoxo: yeh but raider io score bro
[2:23:08] SlayerLightStorm: @casualboomer I've been playing SL for 2-3 weeks on my Hunter, still at 163 ilvl currently, and the drop rates for gear in Dungeons are ass compared to BfA.
[2:23:18] syriusqt: @Amarlian THX :)
[2:23:23] Buzzz_Light_Beer: SL would be better if there were less Micro aggressions from the mobs. Maybe be able to talk things out and have unity.
[2:23:31] zulway_: @casualboomer never been able to get into a +10 or higher as pug although I have done more than a few of those in a guild group
[2:23:48] TheCliffyShow: I'm back everyone!
[2:23:53] casualboomer: @SlayerLightStorm no argument. You're missing my point. My point is that people who have played since release have now progressed in normal/heroic raid to get enough gear to start getting carried by guildies into keys they don't belong it
[2:23:54] casualboomer: in*
[2:24:00] Crowzcut: i bet
[2:24:09] banishtyrion: that slug melted quite fast
[2:24:10] Savagedave: just dont watch last season
[2:24:12] Crazyjuniot: Have you been PVPING at all?
[2:24:31] Savagedave: they game of throned it bad
[2:24:40] I_DoctorSatan_I: @SlayerLightStorm Upgrade your covenant gear up to 197 with Anima. Mythic 0 loot is 184 and your 197 Covenant Campaign gear would be better. Focus on weapon, rings and trinkets.
[2:24:40] CritcobainTV: Finally hit 1830 last night leading some RBGs
[2:24:45] ThudsonTV: well without spacey they had to make some shit up
[2:24:53] casualboomer: @zulway dunno what to tell you bud. I've pugged every key I've run this expansion as a tank. I have no guild
[2:25:04] TheCliffyShow: Didn't help that the star of the show ended up being a sex predator.
[2:25:23] casualboomer: venruki tilted you hard LUL
[2:25:29] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I've beaten venruki and Cdew before, but that was in like legion when i played a lot
[2:25:29] MKindberg: @Towelliee What is the hardest dungeon this expasion in your opinion?
[2:25:30] Mallaes: coxDerp
[2:25:30] TheOGDaywalker: whats a good site to pay for a carry chat?
[2:25:46] CritcobainTV: was it Nahj? lol
[2:25:49] cronymahoney: Venruki went easy on Towelliee LUL
[2:25:49] gmike66: how much was the carry
[2:25:50] othraerir: seems suss towel ;)
[2:25:52] zulway_: @casualboomer tanking makes it easier to get into pugs, I guess. as a melee dps you spend like ~30 minutes finding a decent group
[2:25:53] casualboomer: @Daywalker0922 if you want a good gold only community, depends what server you're on. I sell and boost on Illidan
[2:25:56] I_DoctorSatan_I: paying for carries LUL LUL
[2:25:58] JackHealMe: I think id leave if I saw Ven lol
[2:25:58] SlayerLightStorm: @I_DoctorSatan_I Sounds like a good idea. I just got my first piece of Covenant campaign gear not too long ago.
[2:26:04] Crazyjuniot: That’s how it always goes
[2:26:06] Kronosrebus: !uptime
[2:26:07] jerseyfive: ez just beat blizzcon champs Kappa
[2:26:08] Savagedave: how much are carries these days
[2:26:13] casualboomer: @zulway yeah, especially on spiteful week where nobody wants two melee in the group
[2:26:31] kharnij83: whast it cost
[2:26:47] Crazyjuniot: What’s the cost for the carry
[2:26:54] casualboomer: Early NA hours are where the climbing happens

[2:27:24] Crazyjuniot: Only 2 mil
[2:27:28] Metket: 2m for 2.1k and 5m for keystone master
[2:27:39] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i was running 2's around 1800 and people are boosting to players to 1800 and we fuckin went against like 5 rank 1's in a row
[2:27:51] CritcobainTV: arcane mage is just imposible to kill, they're so mobile
[2:27:59] casualboomer: @Daywalker0922 don't know what server that is. You're likely not going to find a gold only boost service that accepts gold on that server. real money transactions, of course are against ToS, so I wouldn't suggest those either
[2:28:06] Zapotek_S: venruki is a beast
[2:28:30] StateFarm206: KEKW
[2:28:31] casualboomer: LUL that's our discord LUL

[2:29:07] JackHealMe: What do them carries involve? like is it just rating?
[2:29:19] casualboomer: @Towelliee our boosting discord at the end of BfA at one point had 50 M+ channels full on a Monday night. I see so many familiar names running keys these days
[2:29:27] Whippedkreme: Whippedkreme subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[2:29:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @SlayerLightStorm Yea, bust out all the Anima WQ's, Mission Table rewards with Anima, chests that reward Anima. Also, the weekly "Replenish Resevior" for 1000 Anima will certainly boost up your campaign gear a few ilvls in a matter of ~1-2 hrs of Anima farming. The most they will cost is 300 Anima per 191 > 197 upgrade.
[2:30:10] Xorag_: if you use the premade groups filter addon you can see the classes/roles for group finder groups
[2:30:12] casualboomer: Yeah getting carried PvP carried is a completely different language and world, and the game moves so slow for them
[2:30:34] casualboomer: for me, I miss 90% of what they tell me
[2:30:40] bec0o: i need to make gold to get boost
[2:30:42] SlayerLightStorm: @I_DoctorSatan_I Alright, I'll do that when I get home from work.
[2:30:46] bec0o: im at 700k now
[2:30:51] I_DoctorSatan_I: @SlayerLightStorm SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:30:56] RocketTanks: What if you are bad and they realize they can't carry you? Lmfao.
[2:31:00] Bounty4321: Wife and I got to 1800+ but man is it tempting to find a carry to 2100 haha, the 1800 bracket is full of carries and really tough to get out of this season.
[2:31:00] casualboomer: and their bars are literally like 6 spells, all with three different macros to target arena1 arena2 arena 3
[2:31:40] casualboomer: So our boosting community LITERALLY tells people that a certain level of skill is required. They'll get you as far as they can, then pro rate a refund if the player can't carry their own weight
[2:31:41] cheersfordoobies: did you get carried in pvp towellie?
[2:31:42] CritcobainTV: It's hard for a mage to carry someone without survivability. Warriors don't have any self heals
[2:31:43] cheersfordoobies: to 2100 or w.e
[2:31:44] casualboomer: usually that's 2k+ CR
[2:31:54] howitser105: warrior doesnt really synergise well with anything else but a healer in 2s

[2:32:05] Kronosrebus: that 1337 agility
[2:32:16] CritcobainTV: @Kronosrebus Pog
[2:32:18] Madnezz123: LUL
[2:32:22] CritcobainTV: peanut butter arena POGGERS
[2:32:24] casualboomer: yeah, you have to know your stuff AND their stuff
[2:32:35] Cakeabsorber: Peanut butter LMAO
[2:32:38] casualboomer: which, when it comes to arenas, is literally every class
[2:32:38] Crazyjuniot: LUL
[2:32:44] cryft: hoj into pb i got the jelly PogChamp
[2:32:47] northcub: is it common for professional World of Warcraft players to pay other players to carry them in WoW
[2:32:49] fruitvendorx: What did the boost cost you in gold?
[2:32:51] bennythejet_ne: Will you stream it?
[2:32:55] Cakeabsorber: HoJ into peanut butter, wouldn't have it any other way TBH
[2:32:56] cheersfordoobies: oh nice
[2:33:00] CritcobainTV: O shit, this new PogChamp is SodaPoppin towPog
[2:33:02] zeviika: wtf is that pogchamp :(
[2:33:04] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[2:33:04] PhoosKee: if?
[2:33:06] howitser105: gear is alright,weapons and trinkets cost alot
[2:33:08] bennythejet_ne: @nevrisx 2 million
[2:33:23] casualboomer: @northcub it's common for players with a lot of gold to pay for carries period. This expansion, the easiest route to gear is through PvP
[2:33:26] Bounty4321: How much is a carry from 1800 to 2100 @Towelliee ?
[2:33:39] casualboomer: so yes, even pro streamer WoW players end up buying boosts on the part of the game they don't play
[2:33:43] iKONZ: how much is 2 mill in cash?
[2:33:49] casualboomer: we sell entire Mythic clears later in the expansions
[2:33:58] Savagedave: i mean if I had a couple of mil laying around id boost too lol
[2:34:03] bennythejet_ne: Necrotic and bolstering this week—I am planning to stick to 10s as a prot pally
[2:34:05] SlayerLightStorm: Man, I hope I didn't break my finger doing laundry last night. Accidentally punched the dryer when I was trying to get my laundry in the dryer. Sucker hurts like hell.
[2:34:08] RocketTanks: like $400 or something
[2:34:14] Crowzcut: lol
[2:34:18] Xellana287: @Bounty4321 400 dollars roughly?
[2:34:26] casualboomer: LUL 3s carries are a different world than 2s carries. They cost 2x what 2s carries do LUL
[2:34:27] Lamspread: "thats wonderful" lololol
[2:34:37] CritcobainTV: @SlayerLightStorm RIP
[2:34:42] fruitvendorx: That's about right, that's around what I charge
[2:34:42] Mecabeast: some pricing is like 100k per 100 mmr
[2:34:45] kharnij83: ask bahjeera fr a carry
[2:34:46] casualboomer: Lower ratings cost less
[2:34:46] Bounty4321: Jesus, $400 in gold to go from 1800 to 2100?
[2:34:48] LoseAlotLuke: disgusting
[2:34:49] Archiee: LUL
[2:34:49] paradoxyy: at least u get higher reward for harder content,pvp is def harder than 15
[2:34:50] SpoonManes: get athene to do it lol
[2:34:53] I_DoctorSatan_I: wow....2m gold for a carry? Imgaine your 9.0 gear will be replaced in 9.1 in about 2.5 months and you spent 2m gold on a carry....ooof.
[2:34:54] northcub: but if a professional World of Warcraft player has to pay other players to carry them in WoW shouldn't they find another pastime?
[2:35:03] casualboomer: 2M gold is nothing chat. Long boi was 5M gold by itself.
[2:35:13] CritcobainTV: Yeah well i have 40k @casualboomer
[2:35:14] casualboomer: Towelliee plays 15 hours a day. He's got the gold for it.
[2:35:21] Savagedave: is this the first time u get boosted?
[2:35:23] zeviika: northcub difference between pve and pvp player
[2:35:24] Buzzz_Light_Beer: Is it true the spider is the best mount in wow
[2:35:39] CritcobainTV: @northcub LUL imagine thinking pvp is the only aspect of the game to be good at
[2:35:39] idenkaz_: no, Molly is
[2:35:43] cheersfordoobies: isnt vers mastery verse haste bis for tanks and shit anyways
[2:35:45] RocketTanks: I get it. I spent all day yesterday farming 1600-1800 in rbgs and it SUCKED lmfao.
[2:35:48] MisterLegend: hello from germany
[2:35:49] othraerir: can't your guild carry you?
[2:35:49] casualboomer: @critcobain I'm not saying this to be mean or make people feel bad. That's 20 callings. That's 5 days of callings on 4 lvl 60 alts.
[2:35:51] paradoxyy: It was reverse last 4 year tho @Towelliee
[2:35:53] TheUnknowing: the only thing that makes towelliee professional is that he gets paid to play the game basically, you dont have to be good at the game for that lol
[2:36:00] zeviika: critcobain esp considering pvp is one of the least played parts of the game
[2:36:05] Madnezz123: are they buffing pve gearing?
[2:36:09] skruffie_: its also his job, takes money to make money
[2:36:10] jerseyfive: but do you really need that gear? 9.1 will replace all of it...
[2:36:13] cryft: the essence of an mmo is "get help to do things", paying for carry with in-game currency is what its all about
[2:36:26] zeviika: jerseyfive thats literally saying why raid or do m+ for gear. the next raid replaces it
[2:36:27] casualboomer: @jerseyfive they're doing mythic progression....of course he needs it
[2:36:30] zeviika: that doesnt even make sense
[2:36:37] CritcobainTV: @casualboomer i don't bother with callings, when i drop to 20k i sell key carries, but i already have most of the mats an shit i need, i dont buy cosmetics or mounts and i do my own pvp :P

[2:36:40] Crazyjuniot: I haven’t kept up how many mythic bosses have you downed?
[2:36:40] TheUnknowing: With that mentality there is no point in playing at all
[2:36:40] Madnezz123: with that mentality you dont play wow LUL
[2:36:42] northcub: very true unknowing, very true
[2:36:43] Velashen: Why bother playing till 9.3? ;)
[2:36:43] Rayngood: why level? next expansion will just be higher
[2:36:46] zeviika: thats like saying why clean your house itll just get dirty again
[2:36:59] LibaHunt1: I don't watch Towelliee to see him sweat to get to the highest rank
[2:37:00] Mecabeast: still think vers should be a pvp stat and mast the pve stat
[2:37:03] Bounty4321: @Towelliee Wife and I have gotten a few people to 1800 in 3's by pretty much carrying, think we could just sell carries? We've just been doing it free to help people out, never thought of selling it lol
[2:37:04] casualboomer: @critcobain callings are 2k per toon per day. straight raw gold.
[2:37:11] surrendermonkee: dont listen to them Towelliee...you do you mate
[2:37:13] TheUnknowing: why eat if im just going to be hungry again?
[2:37:17] CritcobainTV: Imagine taking showers just to sweat more later KEKW
[2:37:20] VBTIGER89: Why wipe your ass you are just going to shit again
[2:37:30] paradoxyy: @Towelliee I am good in pvp for example,and i hate pve i payed the same for mythic raid boosts for conduits,tho im 2.8k in 3s
[2:37:32] kharnij83: i have that mentality on making the bed when the wife asks me to
[2:37:34] Buzzz_Light_Beer: Why poop if I’m just going to eat a again
[2:37:38] I_DoctorSatan_I: just wait until 10.0 when gear will be 400 4Head 4Head
[2:37:48] RocketTanks: That is the real takeaway. SOOOO many PVE people forcing themselves to PVP or paying for PVP carries because PVP is REQUIRED for competitive raiding right now.
[2:37:55] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:37:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: why get a PS5 when PS6 is just around the corner Kappa
[2:38:02] CritcobainTV: @casualboomer assuming u have 3 callings for each toon sure, but you only get one per day if u do them all, and that's like usually what, 30 minutes if u have to go do a dungeon right? better to spend that 30 minutes farming 50 widowbloom and making 5k
[2:38:11] JackHealMe: Just noticed are you not with DJ anymore??
[2:38:21] krazykago: towHAMUP

[2:38:31] I_DoctorSatan_I: Why flush the toilet when you're just gunna shit in it again 4Head
[2:38:36] paradoxyy: @TbaerTank Thank god for that last 4 year u had to do pve only for pvp,u can have 1 season reverse
[2:38:38] jeneraljelly: The trill carries were real
[2:38:46] casualboomer: @critcobain do you booboo. Not gonna tell you how to play the game. Just pointing out that doing the minimum WQ now guarantees 2k gold a day, which is enormous raw gold from Blizz compared to earlier expansions
[2:39:06] alextheory_: cause mythic+ doesnt loot anything and pvp way easier to loot
[2:39:09] casualboomer: I could make 60-100k in that same half hour boosting keys, depending on the key. I was making 300k per 2 hours boosting Torghast early expansion
[2:39:16] PulseOnline: I never get 2k from callings....like 1-1.3k usually, not 2k
[2:39:30] Godrick85: @critcobain widowbloom is like 40 gold on my server

[2:39:33] CritcobainTV: @casualboomer if you get lucky and get a "do 3 world quests" sure. But what happens when a dps has to queue for a dungeon to get the "defeat elite" blah blah blah"
[2:39:46] CritcobainTV: @Godrick85 like 90-110 on my realm
[2:39:46] Bounty4321: How is Ele Sham in Arena?
[2:39:48] northcub: I just think a professional World of Warcraft player should be skilled at the game is all not paying for others to carry them
[2:39:58] zeviika: critcobain they always have another option. the defeat one always has a WQ tied to it not the dungeon
[2:40:03] zeviika: critcobain well you have the choice
[2:40:10] I_DoctorSatan_I: Why download the latest GPU Driver when you can just buy a new GPU with a already updated driver 4Head 4Head
[2:40:11] EllisTheMenace1: @Bounty4321 ele sham is vs good in 3s // in 2s it struggles but you need a healer
[2:40:14] casualboomer: @critcobain there are WQs that qualify for the challenge ones that stay up for 2 or 3 days. I just go do those....
[2:40:14] RocketTanks: @paradoxyy I started off this game PVPing. I don't think anyone should want anyone else to have to do content they don't enjoy to be competitive in the content they do enjoy. Just because you had to doesn't mean you should want to force others to. After all, it just means you get bad people when you pug PVP content.
[2:40:19] Savagedave: is it possible to get your legendary memory from twisted corridors?
[2:40:41] casualboomer: Nothing like the start of dungeon run out run in talent swap jig
[2:40:43] zeviika: TbaerTank welcome to wow and min maxing. people gonna do what they have to do to play the best they can
[2:40:55] Bounty4321: @EllisTheMenace1 Yeah I'm coming from WW monk and wanna have caster alt for arena... feel like 2's might be rough with all the Hpal / Arms teams lol
[2:40:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: dis Hunter making us other Hunters look bad BabyRage towBook towBook
[2:41:03] 0doz: @savagedave yes
[2:41:38] Buzzz_Light_Beer: All I know is that it’s cold AF outside snowing,windy and I’m warm in my bed.
[2:41:41] diasterrr: @paradoxyy mate do you remember your feelings back then? you couldnt enjoy the game because you had to do things that you didnt wanted to do , now its reverse !! now pve players are going to experience the same thing , its wrong to just see things from your own perpective , the game has to be good for both kind not just one
[2:42:15] zeviika: think it was a solid 5 degrees here
[2:42:34] CottonRocker: I live in the midwest and we are in a blizzard warning rn
[2:42:50] othraerir: it was 38C here today
[2:43:07] northcub: do you gain a sense oof achievment when you pay for someone to carry you in World of Warcraft?
[2:43:15] I_DoctorSatan_I: 40F where i am
[2:43:21] Drala2k: It was zero here this morning 😳
[2:43:34] Lloydbanksz: its snowin in cali high desert
[2:43:55] Archiee: Murder scene?
[2:43:55] kobangames: yo @northcub some ppl just aren't good at PvP, and can only get so far without help, chill the hell out dude
[2:44:06] Xepiii: good question xD
[2:44:08] L4dy_Renegade: I'd be afraid that something was wrong with whoever was in the house. D:
[2:44:23] Mallaes: BibleThump
[2:44:33] Xytrixz: My first thought would be, is this a break in kinda situation?
[2:44:34] CrimsonNurse: Maybe they for an emergency
[2:44:36] CritcobainTV: Owners were robbed and murdered BibleThump
[2:44:39] L4dy_Renegade: Like maybe one of their owners fell down or something and was unresponsive.
[2:44:49] Steppie: “Jeremy!? Whose dog is this?”
[2:44:53] dizzieisbae99: yh suspicious to me
[2:45:04] jbmoongirl: Kids....leave shit open all the time....neighbors did that all the time and their dog was very territorial.....kept me in my car for an hour one time....
[2:45:17] CritcobainTV: Was just thinking worse case scenario, hope to god nothing like that happened
[2:45:24] Xepiii: everybody lock your doors like why not extra timebarrier + privacy
[2:45:39] Archiee: 35 LUL
[2:45:43] cryft: yooo free dog
[2:46:13] CritcobainTV: They're short haired too
[2:46:13] itsagentscully: forreal

[2:46:24] Savagedave: yah the rain is what does it
[2:46:25] SpoonManes: nearly frostbite temps
[2:46:30] cheersfordoobies: ide definitly would have found its home to
[2:46:34] Molvonos: Smaller animal, less body mass, less capacity to retain bodyheat.
[2:46:35] letrickyxd: Huskies LOVE cold weather
[2:46:37] Archiee: 35 is hot for a husky lol
[2:46:39] CritcobainTV: @northcub They usually were in packs, and huddled for heat
[2:46:44] Xepiii: true I have had pomeranians
[2:46:44] Molvonos: 35 degrees is bad for smaller animals.
[2:46:48] CritcobainTV: I'd imagine

[2:47:16] Molvonos: Dude, here in AZ, we have a bunch of huskies in the area. Shaved down to shorthair, but yea.
[2:47:17] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee We had a cooling collar for a huskey we had when i was younger
[2:47:19] Buzzz_Light_Beer: With making mutant dogs for ppls desires you have to take care of them
[2:47:23] letrickyxd: was the cutest thing when I saw a coli husky see snow for the first time, it LOVED that shit
[2:47:25] Armdel: they handle the heat better than you'd expect apparently
[2:47:26] CritcobainTV: It's just a ring of ice around their neck basically
[2:47:27] L4dy_Renegade: Yeah, my tiny chi-poo is just like a poodle and has hair as opposed to fur with the undercoat. He's always cold.
[2:47:35] brewsuadeshoes: The double coat that a Husky has, actually, helps keep cool air around their bodies when it's really hot. Vice versa with heat v. cold

[2:52:47] dizzieisbae99: can i play wow with low end pc? also which is better classic or current wow?
[2:52:56] CritcobainTV: No they didn't, Safety Dance was Heigan the Unclean in Naxxramas
[2:53:03] CritcobainTV: Safety dance *
[2:53:07] Molvonos: Classic WoW, lololol. Nothing's good about 15 year old content.
[2:53:09] othraerir: haha @critcobain :)
[2:53:10] warrenny: @dizzieisbae99 Current
[2:53:33] CritcobainTV: @Molvonos nah, some things were fun, it's just too tedious end game

[2:54:02] I_DoctorSatan_I: NANI????
[2:54:04] Scarhearth: if tanks got spiteful you wouldnt see people doing dungeons AT ALL on spiteful weeks...
[2:54:05] MasterNewt: Answer: Cause tanks already get hit by everything else.
[2:54:18] zeviika: dizzieisbae99 classic is grinding a bit or 2 fight mechanics and then some very unbalanced pvp. it honestly is only good for some nostalgia but gets old quickly
[2:54:30] Spiinal1: Good morning everyone
[2:54:34] LegendzHimself: Do you miss your weakaura for heart of azeroth level?
[2:54:34] Molvonos: @critcobain End game, middle game, early game. The whole thing's tedious, built off the ideas of Everquest with a few changes. Grinding mats and grinding rep in the worst way possible.
[2:54:38] rios1k: imagine wanting every affix to be aimed at tanks

[2:55:55] CritcobainTV: @Molvonos Nah man, leveling and pvp is fun, it's just cancer if you try playing classic and retail, it takes all week to get ready for raid in classic
[2:56:05] CritcobainTV: It was definitely some good times with friends man. I enjoyed it for awhile
[2:56:12] Scarhearth: I had some melee dps get mad about me having to kite dog packs in halls of atonement. my response to them was basically "Then stun the hunter mobs so i dont get murdered by the dogs"
[2:56:46] Mecabeast: now hear me out spiteful but only on ranged
[2:57:01] Fades1209: my response is usually "why is damage talking to me about tanking"
[2:57:13] Molvonos: @critcobain You and I remember leveling much differently then. And only certain aspects of pvp were fun, like old AV, to me. The smaller group sizes got stupid fast with raid gear, since pvp gear didn't scale unless you no-lifed your High Warlord stuff.
[2:57:51] byrdeen45: Good morning all
[2:58:01] George2001k: This week everyone is asking for a Mage/Hunter and a boomer for mythic plus... the rest of us dpsers can suck it
[2:58:03] Molvonos: Or getting twoshot with Pom-Pyro mages that flooded BGs when they became a thing.
[2:58:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: WotLK cinematic intro music Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:58:20] Scarhearth: well decided i havent killed sha in awhile trying to get sha mount. went to sha and got the mount finally!
[2:58:52] CritcobainTV: Idk dude, i just played classic for 9 months and i had a ton of fun, yeah shits more tedious in general, but that's why it was fun, everything wasnt handed to you
[2:59:03] bertooso: SL COULD BE BETTER IF we had loot

[2:59:32] jeneraljelly: yeah you can skip the big abom sometimes
[2:59:36] RocketTanks: The best path I have found for ToP is Duel, first 2 packs of Meat, Lich, then Meat.
[2:59:54] Zettabyte: L OMEGALUL OMEGALUL t? PepeHands
[2:59:58] CritcobainTV: It's like the fairly odd parents meme.. "This is where I'd put my loot... IF I HAD ANY!!!!"
[2:59:59] Molvonos: @critcobain Again, definition of fun. I don't mind stuff not being handed to be, but the mindless grinding (which is wholly opinionated, I'm not ignorant of that) wasn't. But I came into WoW from EQ, where *everything* was an openworld grind.
[3:00:19] LegendzHimself: Covenants are a joke and we told them it was terrible from the start
[3:00:21] jeneraljelly: I just want them to balance classes a bit
[3:00:35] NennanPie: @Towelliee if you pull the entire first room of the plague instead of just the two large guys and one small pack you can line up Pride for every boss except for the last
[3:00:41] brokenhelix85: Honestly they have not done hardly any updates or balancing this far in. Pretty basic things in general would make it better.
[3:00:43] othraerir: what, balancing>!>!>!
[3:00:57] raldrik: SL could be better if the desperity between the top specs and bottom specs was not has large.
[3:00:57] othraerir: imagine
[3:00:57] moejimbo: why does night fae have 3 reps to work through?
[3:01:01] blightanker: ember court drop it and never looked back again
[3:01:01] Greivero: court takes like 2 hours to do Zzzz
[3:01:03] thunder993: I like ember court :(
[3:01:03] Molvonos: Yuh, Night Fae got it easy mode all around.
[3:01:03] CritcobainTV: At least prot pally and ret pally healing is getting nerfed tomorrow FeelsGoodMan
[3:01:05] Teckno1922: with venture plan, mission tables are so much better
[3:01:08] zorish: ember court is cool! but only once a week sadly
[3:01:19] Scarhearth: my monk has been hardstuck at ilvl 210 because i refuse to do pvp the lack of M+ hurts me since im primarily a M+ player
[3:01:24] zravendh: @Towelliee How are you enjoying SL? Is there any chance that you'll ever stop playing wow and go to another game?
[3:01:40] Molvonos: Everyone else has to do rando shit for their faction, Ember Court, Abom Table, Blueman Arena. We just wait for our seeds to pop and we get mounts.
[3:01:43] jeneraljelly: @contentstarvedgamer nope
[3:01:43] Greivero: sockets
[3:01:43] Wheeellz: night fae mission table got nerfed and those people are like super behind now

[3:04:40] Greivero: nerf mentality really hurts the game tho, like if MM hunter and dk is doing good nerf them shouldn't be the answer just buff everything else a lil
[3:04:44] Scarhearth: I dont get why on this wing ranged dont just sit and be in melee..
[3:04:53] jerexify: @lumaday @L4dy_Renegade Thanks!

[3:07:30] I_DoctorSatan_I: BM Hunter went from 12th, 16th, 19th and 24th now. Blizzard isnt touching any class tuning until MDI is over. Don't want those BM Hunter 4 second Revive Pet to be competative in the MDI LUL
[3:07:32] MKindberg: @imascootypie Lol why? Dest lock is boring anyway
[3:07:40] vmirix: destro is ass atm
[3:07:43] tulsaboom: @TbaerTank they have since ppl jumping ship left and right
[3:07:55] mastrmind: But why can’t other tanks get some adjustments during progression?
[3:07:58] Todmeister9000: valor?
[3:08:15] itsagentscully: @critcobain Hunters were the only class to recieve a flat damage nerf across the board in the early weeks. Uncapped aoe classes didnt even get touched.
[3:08:28] I_DoctorSatan_I: @masternewt Becasue that will throw off the current MDI "meta" It's nothing but VDH for 3 days.
[3:08:31] CritcobainTV: @itsagentscully yet hunters are still one of the top dps?
[3:08:34] rios1k: yea TBH i feel like I can tell with the blood tune
[3:08:43] RocketTanks: I think it is absolutely ridiculous that tanking hasn't been adjusted though. To have one tank so favored is insane.
[3:08:45] rios1k: ran a couple high keys this week and it felt a bit better
[3:08:49] smntmtg: paladin is the only tank that is behind
[3:08:56] itsagentscully: @critcobain But my arguement is they touched hunters and stopped with pve changes to classes.
[3:09:08] Ldysansa: Ldysansa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Good morning. Hows your day going so far?
[3:09:20] Scarhearth: they nerfed the fuck out of prot warrior and it become unfun
[3:09:24] Greivero: dh will always gonna be good on m+ for the mobility, like in raids DH isnt that usefull in comparison for me DH is balanced in that sense
[3:09:24] I_DoctorSatan_I: @critcobain No, MM is, BM and SURV are trash. That's the ONLY Hunter spec that's "competative" in both M+ and Raid. Black and white numbers dont lie, BM is trash right now.
[3:09:26] CritcobainTV: @itsagentscully they clearly badly needed it, since even after nerfs they're like top 3 or 4 dps classes lol
[3:09:30] mo197: my Galaxy Grape and Peachrings will be here on Wednesday towPog
[3:09:31] rios1k: @Braag there are a few tanks behind
[3:09:48] thebakeriscomingforu: truth. a minor tweek to some tanks and it could completely shift the meta
[3:09:48] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:09:57] itsagentscully: @critcobain and now how many other classes need it? less salt over hunters more salt over overall balancing :)
[3:09:58] smntmtg: @RIOS1k which ones?
[3:10:00] CritcobainTV: @I_DoctorSatan_I And outlaw is best rogue spec by a pretty huge margin? Sub is subpar on most fights cause of the aoe, assassination is completely pointless
[3:10:46] CritcobainTV: @itsagentscully not salty at all, just saying that they clearly needed the nerf, not that other things don't, but idk why complain when ur still topping meters lol
[3:10:52] Greivero: some specs really need some love tbh like survival and bm that 2 out of your 3 dps specs are complete trash thats not how it supose to be
[3:10:58] rios1k: Warr,DK,Pally @Braag for keys
[3:11:01] ShruggAU: ez anima
[3:11:10] mo197: towGold towGold towGold
[3:11:11] thunder993: !progress
[3:11:11] chippchappi: you all talking about mythic raiding? when saying classes are trash`?
[3:11:17] Epixil: true
[3:11:18] smntmtg: @RIOS1k oh talking about raid
[3:11:20] Epixil: like 350 anima
[3:11:21] Greivero: big true
[3:11:26] fabiandoom: sl could be better if raid loot actually dropped
[3:11:27] reformedalex12345: anima isnt that important tho
[3:11:31] Amarlian: Yeah I dont know who thought 35 anima was enough for the time @Towelliee
[3:11:32] Greivero: anime is a slug ffs
[3:11:32] TheFabilolz: SL would be better withtour that raider io bullshit :)
[3:11:32] vluggejaapie89: 35 anime too much tbh
[3:11:34] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Clearly the biggest change coming with dungeon and pve tuning is that we're gonna get 70 anima per dungeon PogChamp
[3:11:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @critcobain It just clearly shows Blizzard can't even balance a pencil on their finger. There was no need for Blizzard to nerf BM,. esp since BM was really good at the end of BFA. Like you said, don't nerf the top, bring the bottom up. Which Blizzard does the opposite.
[3:11:39] brokenhelix85: Anima and valor tokens would be better
[3:11:41] vluggejaapie89: should be 15 anima for a +15
[3:11:43] thebakeriscomingforu: 35 x the level of m+. So 35 x 15
[3:11:47] Scarhearth: I dont get why they nerfed M+ so much
[3:11:55] letrickyxd: BFA prot war was so much fun :(
[3:11:55] Nightshaft25: Nightshaft25 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[3:11:56] WinterSoonBe: Shadowlands could be better if my 184 trinket would not be better than a 213 one.
[3:12:05] jeneraljelly: ive never had a prot warrior tank in SL
[3:12:08] Dragunstorm15: Cause they are all doing pvp lol
[3:12:14] othraerir: bm relied on corruption, they got nerfed anyway, without the -5%
[3:12:23] Greivero: they nerfed m+ cuz raid pushers where out gearingthe content
[3:12:28] Elswango: they balanced warrior when the bastion of might was a thing
[3:12:29] Mrmorpheyus: @Towelliee Hey, your opinion on prot pally ?
[3:12:34] Elswango: so without it they suck
[3:12:35] Cakeabsorber: What's so bad about them?
[3:12:36] Nightshaft25: Windwalker are rising too in MDI
[3:12:48] I_DoctorSatan_I: I love playing my Fury Warrior in M+. Spear of Bation + Bladestorm...love it Kreygasm
[3:12:48] Artivicii: Prot warrs KEKW
[3:12:56] bertooso: Then you have those Pepegas asking for shit in a plus 8 LUL
[3:12:58] TheFabilolz: SL would be better withtour that raider io bullshit :)
[3:12:59] thebakeriscomingforu: VH is going to get adjusted. Talents + conduits are interacting in such a way that their cooldowns are really short cds
[3:13:04] Scarhearth: they got rid of all the stuff that made prot warriors actually good then nerfed the fuck out of them then didnt give them anything to help. spear of bastion is cool and all but god it doesnt help
[3:13:06] TheUnknowing: prot warrior actually feels really good in raid atleast
[3:13:13] ormy86: even when they are good they are clunky to play
[3:13:33] L4dy_Renegade: They always try to re-invent the wheel every expansion.
[3:13:36] Greivero: game would be better if they stop balancing gearing and progression based on top tier players
[3:13:40] D1Chile: @Towelliee also ppl are tyired of playing warrior since most tank played war in bfa car op bfa war

[3:14:37] D1Chile: mdi was bdk
[3:14:45] ThudsonTV: MDI no but mythic raiders in Argus were using Bears & Brewmasters?
[3:14:45] jeneraljelly: honestly MDI is so different than anything actual players do
[3:14:46] Dizmal: 12 PF ?
[3:14:47] Artivicii: Mdi was blood

[3:14:58] Bernardo994: what is it that u are reporting?
[3:14:59] CritcobainTV: I LOVE necrotic wake

[3:15:29] Dizmal: @Towelliee 12 PF?
[3:15:29] Scarhearth: bear tanks are actually great this xpac, surprisingly
[3:15:30] dHinTrO: Yup always report
[3:15:32] Wildside1177: People who "snap" do not lfg

[3:16:45] NippLee: u look good
[3:16:57] thebakeriscomingforu: Well looking at the meta data: VH is in the lead, prot pally , and brewmaster round out the top 3 tanks
[3:17:15] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Nomeroh for UDK - Necrolords is good for M+. Venthyr is slightly competative with Necrolord, but, the Necrolord abilities are great for M+ survival.

[3:19:56] Archiee: You're never not addicted to that shit... you just care more about life than getting high
[3:19:57] Artivicii: @nomeroh but why
[3:20:05] nyypsycho: As someone who stopped doing heroin and methadone i can confirm. it took me 4 years to get off all opiates.
[3:20:12] GiraffeHydra_: Heroin never truly gets out of your system, every 9-10 months your brain will get an insane craving for it no matter how long you've been off of it

[3:20:33] ManneehFresh: 5 years*

[3:50:40] letrickyxd: raider had to exist, even if some people are bad with it
[3:50:41] mulletrocker11358: raideri.o good.. geearscore was shit
[3:50:41] shimwood: I like it for tracking my personal progress, but I don't use it to discriminate
[3:50:43] Darthyrevan: raider io is the curse of wow
[3:50:50] warrenny: Raider.io is great
[3:50:51] PadidinJones: Heya captain @Towelliee
[3:50:58] GoGetItKo: I like IO actually, helps me get into groups
[3:51:00] esceti95: its good otehrways ppl woul be asking for stupid atchievs and shit which u can get boosted
[3:51:03] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee come tank this 5 mists on my alt KEKW
[3:51:08] rLeo2: Raider io is the best thing that could happen to pugs
[3:51:20] stjon13: ya but all it takes is a bad grp to pull your #'s down
[3:51:24] BugattiNugatti: The chances of a 1500+ player being really bad now is kinda slim
[3:51:25] othraerir: or gearscore?
[3:51:27] Thyverian: i mean, im more then capable of doing 15s on time, but im a pvp player, so i do 1 m+ a week, but to get invited to 15.s il have to grind io score
[3:51:39] EnragedSushi: You can buy 1500 io with gold
[3:51:44] banishtyrion: ... a week later ... :P
[3:51:50] EnragedSushi: Easily a 1500 player can be bad
[3:51:52] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @snowman_gaming365 (warning)
[3:51:53] shale93: rio is fine, only problem is people require only meta classes and others have hard time getting groups even with high rio
[3:52:04] Lesliech0w: Players need a quantifiable way to evaluate each other. Ilvls never done what people have tried to make it do

[3:52:08] Valzark: its not better KEKW
[3:52:08] CritcobainTV: @Thyverian Just spend a weekend and knock out 12s. it's not too bad
[3:52:11] rLeo2: I remember those times lmao
[3:52:11] Valzark: its the same shit
[3:52:20] rLeo2: Good ol times
[3:52:20] snowman_gaming365: @Towelliee I saw a redditer is trying to add amount of keys a person has left early on Raider io
[3:52:31] mo197: people are always the downfall
[3:52:32] Fades1209: Io just means you inspect someone with 220 ilvl for a 210 dungeon.
[3:52:36] rios1k: he sat in pvp and got carried
[3:52:39] CritcobainTV: we vault rich bois towPog
[3:52:40] Arctureal: just now nobody cares about gear they look at the score that doesnt say anything and you dont get into m+ even with 225 gear
[3:52:43] Spaede: I love raiderio, people just hate it because of the hard barrier of entry
[3:52:44] GoGetItKo: forreal, ilvl doesn't mean a thing
[3:52:49] slick1729: did he be an 1800 arena carry
[3:52:58] Creative_Pigeon: every piece I have is above 200 except my weapon, I can't get one to drop at all
[3:53:02] BugattiNugatti: @EnragedSushi also 1500 score is probably 10m gold +
[3:53:08] CritcobainTV: My Windwalker is 192 ilvl and i pull like 3.5-4k overall. easily doing 11sa nd 13s and shit
[3:53:08] EnragedSushi: Ok lol ?
[3:53:14] Lesliech0w: Dear lord, that would be a great addition
[3:53:27] Crowzcut: y
[3:53:35] EnragedSushi: there isnt
[3:53:45] Veegore: They don't have a way, they came out and said that without hurting everyone in the dead key
[3:53:47] NILLme: maybe voting system but that can be exploited too
[3:53:54] Bigbharash: all that would do is make ppl more toxic so they would be the first to leave
[3:54:05] rLeo2: Nah voting is not the way
[3:54:16] MrGattz: what if they let you rate people that you are in the group with and then if they leave you can manually mark their profile that they leave. that wouldnt go wrong in any way at all
[3:54:19] rLeo2: Who would you think everybody could vote last pug?
[3:54:23] Cakeabsorber: commendation
[3:54:26] Lesliech0w: voting can be exploited if it's a mostly guild group/whatever
[3:54:28] Sandman_88: commedations
[3:54:28] CADZtv: like a rep system?
[3:54:32] Just_Wargus: Yelp for dungeons?
[3:54:33] Azphelle: commendations
[3:54:33] Meta_meme: comms
[3:54:34] letrickyxd: commendations are literally useless
[3:54:37] NILLme: OW have endorsement system
[3:54:40] othraerir: isn';t there a karma thing in wow?
[3:54:41] 91Niki: I still feel like rating would get abused
[3:54:42] oradros: commendation mean noting tbh
[3:54:43] SKgaming876: Commendations
[3:54:44] Veegore: There's also no way to really count if the key just wasn't do able, after 2 hours in a key it's time to throw in the towel. vs someone being toxic and just dipping
[3:54:47] EnragedSushi: Nah voting wouldn't work. Example that group woulda just voted you out with you not being the issue
[3:54:52] GoGetItKo: endorsement KEKW
[3:54:54] Metket: i need an interrupt counter on raider.io, sick of inviting dps that doesn't kick anything at all
[3:54:56] Azphelle: yeah commendations are just a personal thing
[3:55:03] DenTza: OW is in silence until OW 2 releae, I ugess
[3:55:07] Lesliech0w: OW in general just got stale, no?
[3:55:10] Antdavs24: rating would be nice if it was use properly but lord knows how out of hand that would get
[3:55:13] rLeo2: That pug would vote the shit of of towel if that feature exist KEKW
[3:55:16] cheersfordoobies: bouncing titties are pretty nice
[3:55:16] Blah206: They did release a new map but yeah not much
[3:55:17] banishtyrion: they're preparing OW2
[3:55:23] othraerir: went with everyone else to dreamhaven /s
[3:55:29] stjon13: I was hoping we'd get next patch info this week
[3:55:39] DenTza: Petience is virtue :P
[3:55:49] BugattiNugatti: Good IO and more than 10 timed 15s is mostly a safe bet tbh
[3:55:59] epiczplz: uhh
[3:56:00] zaraine1: as a solo you take what you can get Sadge
[3:56:05] epiczplz: gl with that pull

[4:05:58] SyrothTV: @Towelliee you think it'll be a sylvanis redemtion arc for the next tier?
[4:06:00] Mackkin: when is blizzcon?

[4:10:57] sagethedk: run through layer 8 in no time with a 5 man
[4:11:28] oradros: repair

[4:14:34] Crowzcut: i loved it
[4:14:44] NILLme: they did amazing job with the tony hawk, got big hopes for D2
[4:14:46] Veegore: countless baal runs
[4:14:50] A_RCHR: D2 doesnt need a remaster tbh
[4:14:52] Xailen: Diablo II is pretty timeless
[4:14:54] Blah206: From my understanding they will stay after the project and remain helping existing Blizzard franchises
[4:14:56] Veegore: MF'ing on pindleskin
[4:15:05] Blah206: I hope they include D1 for free as a pre-order or something
[4:15:10] dozilla: Only thing D2 needs is for native support of Widescreen etc.
[4:15:10] MrGattz: you could just play poe and get a better experience
[4:15:18] segarth: WC3 is very good, i didnt like how WC1 and 2 aged

[4:15:45] Veegore: it flopped, blizzard even said it flopped when talking about d2
[4:15:49] 無職提督: reforged is a lost cost already
[4:15:50] stjon13: D4 news at Blizzcon I hope
[4:15:53] zaraine1: flopped so hard, no mans sky style
[4:15:53] Warjun11: they all play classic models in reforged
[4:16:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: Don't expect a lot of reforged though... in some parts classic wc3 its just better
[4:16:09] Blah206: They completely dismantled the reforged team. (Most of them went to the new startups from ex blizz)
[4:16:11] NILLme: starcraft remastered is great too, idk why they failed with wc3
[4:16:25] Blah206: It was a small team made up of HoTs devs. VV is a 200+ studio
[4:16:33] Crowzcut: quin cant wait for d2 and d4

[4:17:04] MOLAR305: its a remaster
[4:17:04] Crazdmadman: its worse than wc3
[4:17:05] Blah206: The campaign yes
[4:17:11] Warjun11: its the same, same balance an everything
[4:17:22] Xailen: not really the same as Warcraft 3, its not blizz quality
[4:17:29] MOLAR305: its not bad, people wanted a new game, and it was a remaster
[4:17:31] Cristiex2012: Same, just different graphics and more bugs i guess
[4:17:36] Veegore: @Warjun11 This right here
[4:17:36] 無職提督: the battle net is all fked, unit stats is all wrong
[4:17:37] Blah206: It deleted the old wc3 client and all the custom games.
[4:17:49] 無職提督: still no reconnecting in 2020
[4:17:50] Ezekyler: it was not the game they showed in the Blizzcon
[4:18:04] AronKustoms: They promised way more then they delivered. And it was scuffed on launch. Pretty much replaced the earlier version, so people couldnt even go back.
[4:18:06] stjon13: I wish they wouldn't have given up on HoTS still like the chars. better than LoL
[4:18:07] Freeks417: @towelliee which dungeon weak auras do you use?
[4:18:07] oradros: @Towelliee because all map created by player are own by Blizzard
[4:18:14] iTzC0LD: w3 reforged are really bad
[4:18:18] Artivicii: Campaign was a good nostalgia run
[4:18:25] Average_Stali: kind of like the interface for baldurs gate
[4:18:31] Mallaes: And pink orcs
[4:19:07] odinsdad75: bullymcgee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[4:19:12] Blah206: They brought in VV because of the job Team 1 did with reforged. They will not make the same mistakes. VV has been remastering games for 30 years.
[4:19:16] Savagedave: towel man have u tried WW?
[4:19:26] jeneraljelly: mists is so much easier than the other dungeons imo they probs gonna buff it

[4:53:37] Hallwack: @Towelliee after doing all the weekly torghasts on my alts i got no juice left to even try twisting corridors
[4:53:58] chrispape: I hate TC.. Maw of the Maw can F*CK off on floor 18 and my Felguard losing all its buffs going up to floor 17 has really put me off
[4:53:59] craigb_: ^^
[4:54:12] theoriginalzinng: too much content and none of it is rewarding besides pvp
[4:54:15] Aervyper: @Towelliee mythic raider ruined islands and now they ruined torghast FIGURES
[4:54:17] redtemplar88: Got my Hpally to Twisting. Finished first layer yesterday. Crazy stuff.

[4:54:48] MourvinMad: @Towelliee ever thought about getting a custom keyboard? Theres a pretty good custom maker community on twitch
[4:54:50] Velashen: @Senaries They are all cheaply made.
[4:54:54] Anakhelon: how much does a 2.1k carry cost anyway?
[4:54:58] bmi86: @Towelliee ive ha dthe same luck with razor naga. ive gone thru 3 difrent types and the keep double clicking and auto roll on me
[4:55:19] silitung: @Towelliee hey man, how's it going?
[4:55:24] HaloS23: @Towelliee now i got to retrain myself to use the huntsman.... was using a steel series merc
[4:55:29] mytherel: who do you contact to get a carry?
[4:55:30] krakenkardz: lol how do you thinkj they are gonna fix it
[4:55:34] DecayedmiNt: Wildstar flashbacks of PvP gear being better than PvE gear
[4:55:36] theoriginalzinng: i dont even want to do keys
[4:55:37] hgizaira: I refuse to pvp, rather be a 215 loser
[4:55:38] Aervyper: probably 5-20k a win????
[4:55:42] theoriginalzinng: do a few a week and be doner
[4:55:46] Elswango: i just hope they don't nerf pvp loot and instead buff pve loot
[4:55:48] theoriginalzinng: wait for your vault
[4:55:51] mikyki: How are they fixing gear?
[4:55:58] Olivermikael: RESILIENCE!
[4:56:09] brettbeb2421: can any1 please tell me the addon he uses that shows on the left? - shows as tank/ healer which one will give extra loot??
[4:56:12] krakenkardz: i hope so becasue i had to grinf 2400 to have BIS gear pretty stupid
[4:56:12] xideontv: just add more freaking loot to raid drops like NYA
[4:56:23] Anakhelon: if they do the side panels like normal instead of just announcement spam, it might come up?
[4:56:28] Lesliech0w: I'm a simple man, I want slightly more drops, I want no Anima/Conduits on the loot table. If they insist on Anima, make it passive generation like Valor.
[4:56:34] lunchbox8669: when is blizzcon live??
[4:56:35] Olivermikael: just bring back pvp stat
[4:56:45] stupiddemocrats21: Anyone get bored of this game ? I haven’t played in like a year
[4:57:02] Ploxceee: How much is the carry lol
[4:57:03] GameingAspect: the loot system dident suck
[4:57:08] Hononoe: where do you get conquest from tho if you dont play pvp ???
[4:57:08] cheersfordoobies: we just need a vendor for raiding/m+
[4:57:21] Senaries: yeah i need that i got many 220 and 223 items
[4:57:37] Olivermikael: valor pints wer so good
[4:57:53] Lesliech0w: dear god, when people suggest they want TF/WF back though, my brain just checks out
[4:58:01] theoriginalzinng: bring back raid sets
[4:58:04] xideontv: the boomer means rbgs
[4:58:10] raldrik: I agree. I have hit my cap on where I can get as a casual. Has me wondering when New World comes out to give it a shot which is bad for Blizz
[4:58:12] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee I have a question I am leveling up a toon and do not feeling like leveling in
[4:58:19] Rossii77: 115ish 120
[4:58:21] Anakhelon: id be down for the return of Justice/Valor. Justice m0s. and down,lfr Valor for Raiding (Normal+) and M+
[4:58:22] Crazdmadman: 125
[4:58:26] sdpercussion: the point is you leave the boosted bracket alone at 2100 and do other things for honor/conquest @Towelliee
[4:58:30] krakenkardz: if you are being carried to 2100 you'll cap the 3500 conq
[4:58:37] DemonicGrizz: WOD what expansion would you recommend
[4:58:44] krakenkardz: you get like 150 conq per RBG win
[4:58:45] Dragunstorm15: how would you change torghast to make it more enjoyable?
[4:58:58] krakenkardz: you have to win one per week
[4:59:05] Lesliech0w: Make Torghast less about it being a Lego obtainment mechanism
[4:59:11] krakenkardz: to stay in that bracket
[4:59:16] Ploxceee: For the box
[4:59:21] krakenkardz: the box
[4:59:22] Ploxceee: not to upgrade
[4:59:23] Elswango: nah you just have to win 1 per week to get gear in vault
[4:59:26] fruitvendorx: You dont have to win anything to keep upgrading
[4:59:30] aminus: no, you only have to win 1 a week if you want it in the vault, otherwise you can just get the smaller one and upgrade it
[4:59:31] Aervyper: @Dragunstorm15 make Torghast like Islands rewards....... period end or discussion
[4:59:34] cheersfordoobies: you need 1 per week if you want your VAULT to be current
[4:59:38] cheersfordoobies: you can UPGRADE at any time tho
[4:59:59] krakenkardz: my priest is 226 ilevel never done a mythic its fucking nuts
[5:00:05] Anakhelon: yeah he can grind conq in rbgs or 3s and then upgrade the rest to 226 regardless
[5:00:08] BlueBlurPrime: once you hit the rating you can drop and still upgrade
[5:00:20] aminus: @BlueBlurPrime no you can't
[5:00:24] sdpercussion: there's a small rating grace period i think
[5:00:34] krakenkardz: 30 rating
[5:00:35] krakenkardz: is the grace
[5:00:43] sdpercussion: there ya go
[5:00:44] Dragunstorm15: they should make a pvp io lol
[5:00:54] krakenkardz: whats AOTC
[5:01:00] CritcobainTV: ahead of the curve
[5:01:02] aminus: @Dragunstorm15 its in the game bruh
[5:01:04] krakenkardz: ph
[5:01:04] sdpercussion: aotc = finish heroic raid
[5:01:05] letrickyxd: @Dragunstorm15 that's literally CR lmao
[5:01:05] Anakhelon: that's mmr isnt it?
[5:01:09] krakenkardz: lol i gues im ahead of the curve lkmfao
[5:01:11] krakenkardz: lmfao*
[5:01:15] wastedx3149: pvp io is mmr lol
[5:01:22] Senaries: i only pve at a casual level and im 215 right now
[5:01:28] deviona: how do u get that much gold my man ?
[5:01:36] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee yes you can. You're able to drop within 30
[5:01:37] krakenkardz: 30 points is the grace
[5:01:39] Bassodia: you can only drop 30 points
[5:01:43] sdpercussion: @Towelliee you dropped too low.
[5:01:45] xideontv: you lose it, stop the fake news chat
[5:01:47] D1Chile: u can upgrade only for the rest of week
[5:01:49] Balzofsteels: yup 100% cant
[5:01:53] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[5:01:54] BlueBlurPrime: ouch
[5:01:57] sdpercussion: we did say that!
[5:01:58] Lantern214: 1775 is the safty net after you break 1800
[5:02:27] BigDP: after many years of been ignored..pvp finally is getting something dude. I'm happy the way it is.
[5:02:28] Redjager87: no reason to risk it ^^
[5:02:29] Ploxceee: lol
[5:02:33] Sollice: Morning everyone
[5:02:36] TweakT: imagine getting drunk as shet on a monday OpieOP
[5:02:41] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee the only reason to risk it, is if you want to win 1 game a week at 2100+ and get 226 in your chest every time instead of 200 to upgrade
[5:02:50] smashwow: so here's a crazy idea. why doesn't blizzard put out a nice little white page on how THEIR systems work. ffs
[5:03:07] TweakT: 1 liter of 7% in my blood EZ
[5:03:10] Senaries: me as a PVE'r dont want to pvp for better ilvl
[5:03:15] BigDP: I agree
[5:03:21] Getitonthelow: how much will it cost for a carry to 2100
[5:03:27] NILLme: PVE should have a similar upgrade system
[5:03:30] Getitonthelow: I suck at pvp
[5:03:33] hgizaira: which one is easier for noob pvp? pugging to 1800 in arena or RBGs?
[5:03:41] fruitvendorx: RBGS
[5:03:45] iTzC0LD: wich add ons are you using ?

[5:03:54] Ploxceee: Are you doing the 2100 on your Pally?
[5:03:57] krakenkardz: yea i got 1800 in a day
[5:04:03] krakenkardz: getting 14 and 16 in rgbs is a joke
[5:04:07] TweakT: i wanna move to cali so i can grow my own weed
[5:04:09] ManneehFresh: how bad can you be before they dont carry you lol
[5:04:09] Molvonos: Most PvE'rs fundamentally believe that PvP shouldn't have suffered for as long as it did. It's not a matter of 'I got mine'. We're happy PvP is finally in a good place, but it shouldn't have been at the expensive of PvE (and vice versa in years past).
[5:04:21] D1Chile: @Towelliee lol new giveaway should be pvp carries lol instead of wow time
[5:04:28] ManneehFresh: im terrible at pvp
[5:04:33] Skizzurp: rating slows down once it catches up to ur mmr tho so getting to like 1300-1400 is super easy but then after that u gotta grind the rbgs out
[5:04:48] CritcobainTV: It happens all the time LUL
[5:05:07] CritcobainTV: I always get within like 3 rating of my goal and then drop
[5:05:20] logdrop69: Did u pay for a boost or do u have friends?

[5:12:00] Redjager87: prot paladin is crazy in 2v2
[5:12:01] tebbix: Fire mage, prot pally? I would be so mad lol
[5:12:05] NILLme: both getting nerfed a bit this week
[5:12:51] Justarandomman: 20k crit is 16k now, still stong ye
[5:12:52] CritcobainTV: It sounds weak, but with mortal strike it'll be enough to kill shit a bit
[5:13:06] BlueBlurPrime: 1.5 mil gold for 2100 boost? thats alot
[5:13:24] Carrion_03: I would rather pay cash
[5:13:25] Redjager87: with damp starting at 20% again should be taken into consideration also
[5:13:38] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee With really really bad players they probably run 3's. windwalker mage OP
[5:13:39] Aervyper: @Towelliee probably3's or RBG
[5:13:44] Blistz1: wait you paid 1.5 million gold for carry yestarday
[5:13:49] akia03: someone else plays there char most likely
[5:13:50] Justarandomman: i know in old days they would pilot your charc to do it, but not now
[5:13:54] Tricarix: well the nerfs are heavily surrounding tournament play
[5:14:15] shadeofdark: Hmm, theoreticaly, how long would it even take for a new player in PVP to get to 2100 or even 1800 ?

[5:14:55] candle_v2: never
[5:15:00] hgizaira: ^
[5:15:01] Tricarix: a new player could get 1800 for sure
[5:15:04] Redjager87: @shadeofdark my friend is new to pvp and he just got his 1800 in rbg took him a few days
[5:15:08] Aervyper: @Towelliee it's so sad to see pvp in the state it is with no reckless.... sad face
[5:15:09] CritcobainTV: a new player? a few months at least. You have to learn your character, You have to learn all the other characters as well
[5:15:11] Skizzurp: depends on hoow much work you put into it
[5:15:18] manmower: if you are catching up on gear and skill, gonna be an uphill battle
[5:15:23] segarth: depends on how fast you can press Convoke
[5:15:26] Bloodhaven08: i started this weekend and we hit 1200 it was nice
[5:15:28] Olivermikael: nah
[5:15:30] Tricarix: Not a week, no.. obviously you need some gear
[5:15:30] Blistz1: BRO hitting 1400 IS HARD AF
[5:15:33] candle_v2: PvP is talked about now because zpvE
[5:15:33] zaraine1: no fkin way
[5:15:37] VictorAvalanche: no way
[5:15:37] Bloodhaven08: we were raid geared
[5:15:39] Talason: towW towHAMUP
[5:15:39] manmower: no way a new player is hitting 1800
[5:15:42] candle_v2: PvE sucks
[5:15:43] Blistz1: i cant even hit 1400
[5:15:43] VictorAvalanche: with what knowledge
[5:15:44] Skizzurp: not in a week but in a season
[5:15:46] Savagedave: you gotta do heroics/m0 then do pvp
[5:15:47] hgizaira: I'm playing for years and can't hit 1800 with pugs
[5:15:48] shadeofdark: @Redjager87 Only doing RBG ?
[5:15:50] blackwooloo: on a fresh 60 i got capped around 1600 and couldnt kill anyone as a warrior
[5:15:52] Bassodia: i started on shadowlands and got 1800 as prot pally (with a boomy) easily
[5:15:57] alotofiguanas: as anew player, i'm getting destroyed at like 1300
[5:16:07] Justarandomman: i think 1600 now is like 2k + in s1/2/3 in pvp
[5:16:12] Redjager87: @shadeofdark hes 1600 in 2v2 but focus more on rbg as its easier
[5:16:12] Tricarix: get pvp gear - with heroic gear you're going to get shit on because you probs dont have vers - and 1800 isn't that tough, a new player could get it in 2-300 games
[5:16:19] manmower: raiders can come in and get some easy points from outgearing competition, but they'll hit the skill wall
[5:16:20] jason_shade: finding partners alone is pretty much the worst thing about wow
[5:16:21] Aervyper: @Towelliee i'm busting my balls on trying to get 10vs10 RBG to 1600 and literally every win and loss is soul crushing
[5:16:40] Skizzurp: yea its like a diff language lol

[5:17:07] Tricarix: yea but the skill gap between those players and 1800 players is massive
[5:17:10] manmower: pvp is fast this xpac, it's a young man's game now
[5:17:12] Blistz1: PVP is harder than PVE
[5:17:18] Justarandomman: thats the main skill, is understanding your opposition.. i don't have a clue now because so much stuff lol
[5:17:21] candle_v2: PvP in this game is kinda dog, can't be bothered

[5:17:34] Tricarix: it's like the diff between Challenger and Gold in league of legends, glad and 1800
[5:17:36] Antdavs24: yea watching pvp streamers is fucking chaotic, respect to them its a whole different level of insanity
[5:17:37] Aervyper: @Towelliee you said it best yesterday there is no DBM for PVP
[5:17:37] CritcobainTV: @TheCandleList maybe ur just not good at it?
[5:17:41] Skizzurp: when i pvpd in cata i used to know when we were gonna get a kill 30 sec to a minute be4 we did usually
[5:17:45] kappaday23: Kappa

[5:19:10] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee something i found nuts was that these rank 1 players can see if someone kicked by the player animation or sound. I had to use a tracker cause I'm too ADHD to pay that much attention
[5:19:12] Affiiance: Did you buy a boost or something?
[5:19:16] jason_shade: they need a rated solo queue in pvp
[5:19:21] averyv123: Who is he talkin bout?Just got here
[5:19:22] Blistz1: Mitch and Xaryu lol
[5:19:22] bmi86: snutz carried quinn
[5:19:35] shadeofdark: @Redjager87 Which class is he playing ? Cuz as i understand, it depends also on the class, cuz like everywhere there are good and bad classes
[5:19:38] kappaday23: Keepo
[5:19:44] bmi86: no he did good
[5:19:45] toobaked1987: Quinn got 3k I dont think he was "carried"
[5:19:46] Tricarix: Quinn could get 2400 on his own but no way he gets 3k without Snutz
[5:19:49] BrutalBlueberry: Ret arena is so fun.
[5:19:53] Justarandomman: did you see bajheera and esfan video for 2.4k, lol esfand did crazy dmg as ret
[5:19:53] bec0o: quin is good
[5:19:59] Redjager87: @shadeofdark affi warlock
[5:20:02] theDirtyon3: rets are using a prot leggo anyways
[5:20:08] biggnastty: you can't get carried to 3k
[5:20:25] Affiiance: Yeah Quinn is good, you arent really carrying him lol
[5:20:25] Tricarix: a glad player def can get carried to 3k
[5:20:27] bmi86: snutz even wanted to carrie him to rank 1 glad
[5:20:33] segarth: did you stream your arenas?
[5:20:33] Secondbreakfasttt: i understand a pve streamer buys a carry but when a pvp streamer does tthat it is just weird to me
[5:20:36] Tricarix: I'm not saying he was hard carried but he definitely was... i guess boosted
[5:20:40] shadeofdark: @Redjager87 They are supposed to be good :) Like the Legendary that applies slow with corrupt
[5:20:50] bec0o: you cant be carried to rank 1
[5:20:55] bec0o: you gotta be good
[5:21:11] Redjager87: @shadeofdark yea they are strong but for a new player not dieing to melee teams is hard :D
[5:21:14] biggnastty: how much gold did it cost
[5:21:27] Tricarix: But look at his W/L @bec0o - there's no way he does that on his own
[5:21:34] shadeofdark: @Redjager87 That is also true :D
[5:21:41] iKONZ: biggnastty 2 MILL
[5:21:42] Justarandomman: Is pvp elite weapon higher than mythic?
[5:21:57] hgizaira: what was the name of boosting team you used?
[5:21:58] Tricarix: PvE gear honestly shit in PvP rn, vers important - double PvP trinket huge for vers
[5:22:04] jason_shade: elite weapon is same as denathrius ilvl @Justarandomman
[5:22:08] CritcobainTV: @Tricarix depends on class
[5:22:15] Skizzurp: or a guaranteed weapon
[5:22:15] iKONZ: biggnastty, so thats about $400
[5:22:23] Daehdorb: how much as the carry?

[5:22:26] oradros: @Justarandomman easier to get
[5:22:28] Lantern214: @Towelliee Yes and no. Healers want the pvp haste stats boost trinket. It's bis
[5:22:38] Lantern214: pve healers
[5:22:45] wolathus: I hate that pvp gear highly impacts pvp gear, for most tanks that only pve the pvp gear is bis for them so its just discouraging for pve only players
[5:22:49] xideontv: i wonder when starlight will be banned
[5:22:52] wolathus: pve*
[5:23:01] candle_v2: gearing is terible for PvE, only reason PvP is even being talked about amongst the PvE community
[5:23:11] capricore: So they meet at the starlight mall (wasn’t that the name of the mall in stranger things?)
[5:23:29] shimwood: Starcourt Mall
[5:23:38] yunggluten: @wolathus welcome to the world that pvp players have dealt with for years and years. Not saying it’s right though
[5:23:56] Carrion_03: Any sites that accept cash for carries?
[5:24:03] Creative_Pigeon: how much gold was it?
[5:24:04] Justarandomman: Can't believe we are 4months into SL, its flown by
[5:24:05] Daehdorb: @Towelliee How much gold was it?
[5:24:06] Affiiance: You do it in 2s or 3s?
[5:24:10] xideontv: as a demon hunter i can tell you i can all pvp gear and ill be pretty competitive in M+

[5:24:24] yunggluten: @carrion_03 that’s against ToS
[5:24:25] Carrion_03: K. Thx
[5:24:32] thiccsushi: @Towelliee They also hook up streamers with prio queue if you want to do 15 carrys for gold should hit up an admin
[5:24:32] Carrion_03: Didn’t know
[5:24:37] CDubTheRIPper: Yeah go with the tokens
[5:24:50] Justarandomman: Is there any mention of what next is going to be?
[5:24:58] candle_v2: @yunggluten PvP has always been niche compared to PvE in terms of playerbase
[5:24:59] yunggluten: Can’t trade out of game currency for in game services outside of tokens
[5:25:05] Knocx: so today i move into the stock market wish me lucj
[5:25:07] Sollice: @Justarandomman I think your timing has been off. Hasn't it only been 2?
[5:25:18] Mecabeast: my personal prob is if i buy a carry im gonna afk and expect results
[5:25:22] Skizzurp: towelliee isnt oging to boost people lol
[5:25:27] zenothebambino: Think he's saying you could be top prio to be the carry
[5:25:37] yunggluten: @thecandlelist it’s still a large player base. Maybe not raising level but that doesn’t mean that pvp players should be shit out of luck
[5:25:40] Justarandomman: @Justarandomman Yup, you're right.. lockdown stuff lol
[5:25:46] Tricarix: they get slapped fast tho thankfully
[5:25:53] thiccsushi: @Towelliee If you sign up for a 15 as a booster you get prio its like 200k gold a run you can bang out weeklys while getting paid
[5:25:55] blackwooloo: windwalkers are nasty
[5:26:00] yunggluten: They get popped so easy though
[5:26:01] blackwooloo: they scary
[5:26:16] Skizzurp: thats what he was talkin about for streamer getting priority
[5:26:25] Tricarix: Lots of things are nasty, pvp kinda in a bad spot right now. Looked really good at the start but as time goes on with little-to-no changes, it's looking bleak

[5:29:38] zenothebambino: should be
[5:29:44] Aro725: blizzcon champ
[5:29:45] Templexx: yes he is
[5:29:46] Justarandomman: ye he is
[5:29:49] feherlofia123: blizz con champion rank 1
[5:29:52] manmower: no he's 2100 apparently, same tier as you
[5:29:54] yunggluten: Yeah he is
[5:29:55] Tricarix: he the cream of the crop
[5:30:03] Justarandomman: ven,raiku,xaryu imo best 3
[5:30:17] Tricarix: @manmower he's 2900 in 3's
[5:30:32] iacobus: How much was the boost
[5:30:34] zenothebambino: 2.2ish
[5:30:35] Aro725: 2200 ish
[5:30:39] Tricarix: 2.2
[5:30:41] Bounty4321: What MMR are the games usually at? A lot of people speculate that it's hard to push to 2100 from 1800 because of carries lol
[5:30:49] BrutalBlueberry: Look out for Athene Kappa
[5:30:51] Qoax: How much gold did it cost?
[5:30:54] Tonywan: what boosting service you use?

[5:30:59] TMMOOF: @Towelliee I think its so nice of you to keep streaming after winning the 1B mega millions, my hero <3
[5:31:08] Tricarix: I'm surprised you're not just getting carried in 3s i fel like it'd be way easier to boost - but i guess R1 players don't want to tank their record/rating
[5:31:10] Elswango: many of the pvp streamers just spam 2s wtih randoms and viewers so their 2s rating is often way lower than it would have been
[5:31:11] letrickyxd: @Tonywan Starlight Boosting
[5:31:15] Aro725: he wasplaying arcane cause the rogue was using the vanish leggo and ven would use mass invis to give the rogue more vanishs

[5:33:21] keeb_wtf: huokan is 385k/hr, if you're an advertiser it's 290k
[5:33:26] PadidinJones: Oh man druid in the maw! Maw riding!
[5:33:26] Ghhost117: Its pretty dumb that it works that way tho lol
[5:33:27] BrutalBlueberry: Does it matter if your rank is in 2v2 or 3v3?
[5:33:29] keeb_wtf: let me know if u need a hookup :D
[5:33:42] letrickyxd: just M+ vendor
[5:33:45] zarod89: no more drops, just vendors lol
[5:33:47] aminus: weekly rotation, they love those
[5:33:58] thiccsushi: oh god no weekly rotation
[5:33:59] Creative_Pigeon: just give me more than 2 fucking chances per raid to get a weapon and I'll be happy

[5:34:24] mo197: @Towelliee what is "BLIZZCONLINE DISGUS!"
[5:34:31] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @bricekendall (warning)
[5:34:47] Nazz_1138: Valor
[5:34:48] Klauzzer: gold
[5:34:51] Polebows: Anima LUL
[5:34:53] BrutalBlueberry: I've ran Castle Nathria 3 times full runs, not a single drop. LUL
[5:34:54] bmi86: @Towelliee the already have that in the game tho. its on the tournament realm
[5:34:59] Sandisy: bump the drops in m+ by 1 extra overall. add valor and let people upgrade x2. balanced since you need to get item first
[5:35:00] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[5:35:10] Tricarix: Upgrading all the gear to 226 is a bitch of honor farm tho, just forewarning but i'm sure you've been told
[5:35:10] RocketTanks: What would be the upgrade requirement?
[5:35:11] aminus: inb4 echoes of nyalotha 2 electric boogaloo
[5:35:13] Czarixgaming: maybe bring back justice and valor as currency
[5:35:18] manmower: upgrade between tiers
[5:35:31] Creative_Pigeon: it should be valor, where you can buy a 180 version, and completing a 10-15 will set the highest you can set your upgrade limit
[5:35:31] facerolljack: Yeah imagine if there were some sort of currency that already existed in the game before that we could use to upgrade M+ drops Kappa
[5:35:33] Karbonn: Upgrading would be swell at this point.
[5:35:47] CazualD: It’d be nice to buy gear with your best stats though. Rather than getting drops with stats that don’t benefit you
[5:35:51] Bounty4321: @Towelliee I've always thought they should kill Raider I.O, build it into the game and have your Dungeon rating work like PvP Rating does for buying items and upgrading etc. Thoughts? lol
[5:35:53] highlydegen: !age
[5:36:07] cheersfordoobies: shit man i already have a few friends who quit because pve is shit compared to pvp
[5:36:07] Tricarix: Does EVERYONE deserve to have the same item level as a top-level PvPer or PvEer tho?
[5:36:09] sdpercussion: 15's being a little higher than heroic like 8.3 was the way...
[5:36:11] dwolters_the_zombieman: yeah i think upgrading gear again would be awesome then you don't have to worry about loot drops
[5:36:17] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[5:36:19] bertooso: Per usual need alt fix for gearing
[5:36:32] Alienfromger: is dudedets even a word?
[5:36:37] vemkmeuput: hi
[5:36:49] zaraine1: alt friendly my ass
[5:36:50] bicchiaki: why can we skip to threads of fate but can't skip the stupid maw intro scenario quests lol
[5:36:52] Greivero: alts gearing feels super bad
[5:36:56] CanadianHellMoose: they just need more drops per dungeon/raid
[5:37:00] manmower: just buy all your sockets
[5:37:02] Aro725: That would be amazing
[5:37:03] Krait06: True
[5:37:04] Swiftie0: AGREEEEDDDDDD
[5:37:08] 91Niki: Yeeep
[5:37:11] CDubTheRIPper: Clap
[5:37:12] yunggluten: yuuuuuuup
[5:37:13] craigb_: agreed
[5:37:14] Swiftie0: YES @Towelliee PREACH!!!!
[5:37:14] st0p_n_sh0p: Corridors not giving soul ash is super tragic along with the unlocking.
[5:37:17] pemadsen17: @towelliee why couldn't you leave the drops in Mythic plus the same, increase the amount of an anima acquired per dungeon, and introduce an upgrade vendor similar to the upgrade vendor from PvP for scaling Mythic drops by item level?
[5:37:17] smashwow: should have been day 1
[5:37:18] Tricarix: don't think there's a single person that disagrees with that, don't understand why they don't do that
[5:37:22] blackwooloo: 9 layers on every fresh alt is ass

[5:38:08] Tricarix: Do you not have the mount? Would figure you would by now
[5:38:09] Creative_Pigeon: lol you have the mount though
[5:38:10] craigb_: rooPog bear in maw
[5:38:12] Molvonos: lol, you can still mount up on your corridor creeper and go faster.
[5:38:12] Amarlian: Dont forget stealth @Towelliee
[5:38:12] cruzeal: druids EZ towClap
[5:38:13] Veegore: you can use your corridor stalker mount there too
[5:38:16] siradonis1: Tears of joy
[5:38:17] BrutalBlueberry: I have 2 mains, and even though there are catchup mechanics for some stuff, I dread levelling an alt for farming Leggos and Soul Ash.
[5:38:17] ryp0: welcome to eazy life
[5:38:18] logic_fl: 9.1 news not until blizcon?
[5:38:24] banishtyrion: because druid is a fair class
[5:38:24] Feorasam: Broken xD
[5:38:29] Veegore: for the lel, druid on maw mount
[5:38:29] sdpercussion: @Towelliee It should be: Heroics 213, +15's 215-220ish, Mythic Raid 226
[5:38:33] Klauzzer: nerf druid
[5:38:35] Bounty4321: Maybe they could just incorporate a PvE / Dungeon Rating (Like Raider IO) into the game and that is how you upgrade PvE gear?
[5:38:36] Veegore: people get salty
[5:38:38] torvoltas: Druid is the best mount
[5:38:39] siradonis1: Worgen Druid, for the double mount dominance
[5:38:41] PadidinJones: Riding the druid mount is a better middle finger to casuals
[5:38:44] RocketTanks: Playing a bear from the start of the expansion is why I haven't leveled my other characters lol. Too lazy to slowpoke it around the maw.
[5:38:58] FryeTV: Bear >brM and paladin

[5:42:10] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[5:42:14] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee They just need to bring back Titanforging and the game will be perfect towPog
[5:42:16] cruzeal: was worth getting rank 3 strife though
[5:42:17] abruptdecayO_O: like visions
[5:42:17] Aro725: 9.1.5 going to be the best ever
[5:42:18] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[5:42:20] balanira: so true
[5:42:21] deadawake_: very true
[5:42:24] theoriginalzinng: big truth
[5:42:28] abruptdecayO_O: hated having to do visions on every alt
[5:42:29] Sneekzx: Biggest issue with Shadowland is dungeons. mythic + is pointless. Do your weekly +10 get your 220 piece and you're done for the week. You got raids, but other then that what else is left?
[5:42:44] Lee6990: The issue is that most people are lazy af and don't do the things that aren't required, which kills the playerbase for pvp etc
[5:42:44] theoriginalzinng: im on the edge of just cancelling, its not fun
[5:42:57] deadawake_: getting that way... ^^
[5:43:13] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee taking another character to Shadowlands.
[5:43:13] toobaked1987: Same. Been subbed to this game for so long, but man this xpac sucks to grind
[5:43:17] Sneekzx: @theoriginalzinng same dude
[5:43:25] CritcobainTV: Definitely am not being serious about that LUL
[5:43:30] facerolljack: man if they fix the PvE Loot system SL will become such a good expansion
[5:43:33] CritcobainTV: i was joking, titanforging sucks
[5:43:37] Dark_lite7: I'm assuming no timescales on 'fixing' this loot issue have been mentioned?
[5:43:43] Exodeo_: Is it possible classic has more loot sources than retail at this point?
[5:43:53] banishtyrion: Anima-forging ? .... :P
[5:43:54] Lee6990: nope ^^
[5:44:03] Unlivedsam: Unlivedsam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[5:44:06] stratiss: No forging, just make pve gear upgradeable ez peasy
[5:44:18] mo197: what does BLIZZCONLINE DISGUS! mean?
[5:44:19] Affiiance: Oddly enough my biggest complaint right now is not having enough Anima on alts
[5:44:30] stratiss: imagine upgrading ur dungeon gear based on how high of keys uve done
[5:44:39] stratiss: would be bad ass
[5:44:59] Thralith: Hello.. Whats the name of that Bear Shape?
[5:45:00] Affiiance: NOT ENOUGH ANIMA
[5:45:06] Bladeheart_91: Night Fae mission table has an issue where you can accidentally level your missions way past your followers and you can't get exp missions anymore.
[5:45:07] OmikronTV: @Towelliee Any word on Prot Paladin buffs?
[5:45:18] starboy_xii: the lack of anima is the biggest imo
[5:45:31] EthicalHermit: @Towelliee callings should always award Anima, plus the greys
[5:45:41] tacofury2: memories dropping off the first boss in a dungeon causing people to leave
[5:45:41] Skizzurp: if oyu do em an 2 toons daily it basically pays ur sub tho
[5:45:46] toobaked1987: Activizion Blizzards stock just hit an All-time-high they are not listening anymore
[5:45:49] VictorAvalanche: Public Anima
[5:45:58] gidgeet: Oh hey your on the Druid nice!
[5:46:13] Lee6990: sounds like a WoD 2.0
[5:46:15] Holysal: WoD 2.0
[5:46:35] highlydegen: Its like the economy, its shit
[5:46:38] Kebabra_: LFR 35 as well
[5:46:43] NILLme: idk i had more fun in wod
[5:46:43] KShellZx: Gearing up an Alt has been a terrible experience
[5:46:44] Evcon_: "let me time this +15 key for 35 anima"
[5:46:44] Todmeister9000: how do you get more from WQs
[5:46:45] Safty: ffxiv bruh ;P
[5:46:45] banishtyrion: i'll probably have my rank 3 buildings a bit before 10.0 hits ... I think
[5:46:47] Holysal: I'm just raid logging now
[5:46:55] dwolters_the_zombieman: yeah it's ap grind all over again
[5:46:56] cRUSSIANthegame: I think collecting Anima being a second job should be addressed
[5:46:57] Frank4LuLz: thats plenty
[5:47:04] Swiftie0: ya or a mythic +15 you get 35 anima where you also get 35 anima in a Mythic 0 lol
[5:47:05] zarod89: maybe anima as currency for all pve upgrades?
[5:47:08] Zarinna2015: Towelliee preach!
[5:47:23] I_DoctorSatan_I: damn...just found out ZiqoFTW got 7 day suspension towCry
[5:47:25] Zarinna2015: Youa are so right
[5:47:25] Sneekzx: My personal experience: I'm in a raiding guild. I cleared normal but was told I'm not good enough for heroic (first time healing in my life so obviously a learning curve) I can't get into groups because all the good players are in cliques so I'm forced to pug mythic + which is terrible. Now I've basically fallen so far behind (only I))
[5:47:37] cRUSSIANthegame: @zarod89 you can barely have anima right now for non power upgrades you think you'll have enough to upgrade gear?
[5:47:41] Shellstars: So I'm a casual player, cause of work. Its so hard to even fear up my main let alone my alts. Theres a lot to do but with not much reward..feels like
[5:47:42] cRUSSIANthegame: anima collecting is a joke
[5:47:44] siradonis1: I think in M+ you could multiply it by the key. A 10 should give you 35x10 Power, a 15 35x15
[5:47:50] Shellstars: x
[5:47:51] sagethedk: i left my guild because of cliques in the guild
[5:47:52] D3m0nHunt3r666: actually how hard is to add more anima to m+ and raiding like wtf
[5:47:55] NILLme: yeah he said "fak it" ..
[5:47:59] Kebabra_: The better players should get the better gear
[5:48:02] Lee6990: @lilrogue_ that's when you join a new guild

[5:48:17] Lee6990: lmao
[5:48:18] Shellstars: ^gear up soz
[5:48:19] Sneekzx: @lee6990 Yeah I've thought about it lol
[5:48:22] theDirtyon3: True LUL
[5:48:23] banishtyrion: timewalking dungeons would give about heroic dungeon level gear in bfa, now they're not even worth doing
[5:48:29] balanira: forsen got banned for that because of his accent
[5:48:30] Frank4LuLz: gamer word
[5:48:31] zarod89: @cRUSSIANthegame ye so make bosses drop more anima and add a vendor to upgrade those pieces
[5:48:37] Asonderr: hes a twitch ambassador too isnt he?

[5:48:47] Lee6990: @lilrogue_ if you're pugging high m+ keys, you can definitely do heroic raids
[5:48:47] siradonis1: 158 for Timewalking is ridiculous
[5:48:48] backseatstreamer: DJHUNTERX
[5:48:52] sagethedk: twitch is stupid up top
[5:48:56] Warzam: Wth is a worse F Word?
[5:48:56] toobaked1987: Blizzard wants us to be slaves to the grind so badly they nerfed timewalking raids..........
[5:49:08] KShellZx: I got that stupid batwing cloak from the timewalking quest
[5:49:08] Evcon_: ziqo is a class act.
[5:49:19] Shellstars: A lot to do in Shadowlands but with very little rewards
[5:49:21] Frank4LuLz: he's AOL chat streamer
[5:49:37] BrutalBlueberry: My Timewalking reward was literally a duplicate of a lower ilvl.
[5:49:42] Sneekzx: @lee6990 Wouldn't say high, I've only done like 8's but I have done the first 3 bosses in heroic and I thought I was doing decent
[5:49:45] Amarlian: This area desperately needs a "I have seen this story before" button.
[5:49:50] falldrgn: nope
[5:49:54] Creative_Pigeon: need a fucking skip
[5:49:56] VictorAvalanche: no
[5:50:00] VictorAvalanche: it should have one
[5:50:00] NILLme: prob a 9.1 feature LUL
[5:50:02] I_DoctorSatan_I: Ziqo has been asking for vods, clips anything for his case, becasue he's in the dark about what was said. Twitch isnt providing any "proof". His account manager was the one who told him about his suspension @Towelliee
[5:50:03] Raxxiety: NOPE
[5:50:04] bertooso: Should be
[5:50:06] Nightshaft25: LUL
[5:50:13] Shellstars: No gotta do the same shite
[5:50:20] Amarlian: At least these in game scenes please blizz
[5:50:20] KShellZx: I feel like thos whole scenario should be skippable for alts
[5:50:30] letrickyxd: Twitch Support is a whole circus of clowns man
[5:50:35] siradonis1: That´s where the free leveling option should have just dropped you to Oribos instantly
[5:50:46] Lee6990: @lilrogue_ yeah I used "high" loosely, but if you're actively pugging 8's, that probs means with guild groups you'd be doing 10+, so I'd assume it's them being cliquey more than it is you being not good enough
[5:50:47] xxKrayzie: yeah alt friendly they said^^
[5:50:47] mo197: @Towelliee what does BLIZZCONLINE DISGUS! mean?
[5:50:48] toobaked1987: @Towelliee maybe this will be the expansion we all leave together. LAWL
[5:50:48] daddiesprinzess: towJoe

[5:50:50] Nightshaft25: Lets start from Oribus right away LUL
[5:50:55] Aro725: They need to let you skip the RP at least its so slow.

[5:51:11] mrbzombie: the problem with skipping the maw is they have those level gates for zones
[5:51:13] Scarhearth: I did the maw on 7 toons already...
[5:51:14] TheFlyingFatMan1983: I think the reason why it's unskippable is because it has quests as opposed to the Legion and BFA scenarios, which don't.
[5:51:22] daddiesprinzess: towQueen
[5:51:31] Sneekzx: @lee6990 Yeah, I think so. Do you have a guild on Zul'Jin? LOL
[5:52:19] Scarhearth: my last toon to get through it atm is my priest
[5:52:23] siradonis1: Sounds nasty indeed
[5:52:23] Skizzurp: doouble PI over and over
[5:52:24] Lee6990: @lilrogue_ Unfortunately I'm Thrall horde :P Give the WoW forums a check, and trade chat should have enough ads for guilds. Better to try one of them than be stuck as a social in a shitty guild

[5:56:28] xideontv: poor Thrall can't mount up
[5:56:34] KShellZx: When do you think they'll introduce a Flight Whistle again?
[5:56:45] SyrothTV: all the high rated teams are iffy on it tho cause it may or may not be clever mechanics as it's a prot item
[5:57:21] ekeen89: Just started playing WoW since Cata did my frist time walking dungeon and got the infinate timereaver
[5:57:25] Armander_: Towelliee you making a druid tank?

[5:58:39] FresheFefe: every week i get some loot, sometimes
[5:58:46] oodroonoo: ye ursocs lego is really strong for big pulls, but lacks on single target
[5:58:55] Sollice: Ugh I reinstalled windows I have to get the Frankerz fix
[5:58:56] SyrothTV: PogO @OscGarza
[5:58:58] siradonis1: As a healer main, I like healing Bears.
[5:59:09] oodroonoo: barkskin lego is arguably better for tyrannical weeks or dungeons with smaller pulls
[5:59:13] DecayedmiNt: @Sollice What made ya reinstall?
[5:59:18] Veegore: there's like 4 you rotate through as guardian, thrash double thrash, or barkskin gives you ironfur and fr, and the single target neck one for 40%
[5:59:19] infektyd: @smokeybunnyy agreed, but most of M+ i find im pulling bigger packs, than the barkskin leggo for aids
[5:59:29] salathia86: salathia86 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[5:59:31] gidgeet: @siradonis1 Same here, I enjoy Bears and BM leveling at lower levels
[5:59:32] Sollice: Was getting some crashes
[5:59:33] infektyd: raids even
[5:59:40] Sollice: Pretty sure it wasn't bad hardware
[5:59:47] oodroonoo: @infektyd yeah same, its rare ill even want to use barkskin lego since ursocs is so strong. only dungeon i prefer bark on is TOP

[6:00:35] infektyd: @smokeybunnyy yea, ToP has higher hp trash mobs that are prewtty much mini bosses throughout the whole place
[6:00:35] Aro725: wq upgrade i think
[6:00:39] balanira: i wish blood dks had a cool leggo ... superstrain is boring

[6:01:20] infektyd: 2 a week yes
[6:01:24] mo197: so what is going to be your meaningful choice for this toon?
[6:01:26] Shablagoosh: @Armdel what did you do to catch up? I took 2 weeks off and im 19 still

[6:01:43] SyrothTV: so whever ur cov's 2nd person is 7th row unlock
[6:01:48] Klauzzer: furry gang
[6:01:50] mo197: hahaha table easy mode
[6:02:01] Swiftie0: @Towelliee Are you going to go through campaign or threads?
[6:02:26] oodroonoo: @infektyd have you ever thought about using bark for tirna scithe? it feels like there arent too big of pulls in there unless you're doing it before the last boss
[6:02:29] Skizzurp: na potion of phantom fire is troll asf
[6:02:48] Skizzurp: ive popped that several times as a dh with 40% haste after eye beam and gotten 1 proc in 25 secs
[6:02:50] Armdel: @Shablagoosh a bit of everything. daily callings, m+ and LFR. aswell as doing all the covenant story chapters
[6:02:51] Krait06: im doing it right now
[6:02:56] gidgeet: So Resto Shaman or Holy Pally, I like shaman
[6:03:08] Engram08: SL could be better if? @Towelliee
[6:03:15] siradonis1: There are only 4 avaible tho, right?
[6:03:24] Strik3r019: yea if u dont heroic raid gl getting over 205 without vaults
[6:03:25] balanira: timewalking is viable for 50-60 lvling ?
[6:03:28] infektyd: @smokeybunnyy i do run with it in mist, and run with survival of the fittest to have the 30% DR on a 34s CD plus a stack of ironfur and frenzied, it makes the bear so solid
[6:03:39] pacokoi: I wish they made all 8 dungeons available while leveling so annoying only having 4
[6:03:40] SyrothTV: @gidgeet holy pala are better atm for pvp; but i think sham is better pve imo
[6:03:43] infektyd: those packs int he beginning hurt..
[6:03:45] KingSlayerYotam: no
[6:03:46] DeanoTV: TW is same amount as normal dungeons
[6:03:53] KingSlayerYotam: gives 20% per dungeon
[6:03:55] VictorAvalanche: tw exp sucks now
[6:03:58] siradonis1: That is good, more variety
[6:04:02] Mightbeworth: TW gives very minimal exp for completions
[6:04:09] VictorAvalanche: no
[6:04:10] siradonis1: Ah nvm then
[6:04:13] Olivermikael: no exp from TW
[6:04:14] CanadianHellMoose: TW is shite xp
[6:04:15] Scarhearth: TW is ass for leveling
[6:04:17] Engram08: SL could be better if they give arms warriors the legion itteration :)
[6:04:29] Kael88: Cata ones feel harder, longer and give less xp
[6:04:29] SyrothTV: only did the tw for the sack on the vault quest @Towelliee
[6:04:35] ayrennasky: don't do TW, they give u less XP
[6:04:37] oodroonoo: @infektyd i think im gonna have to try it for TS then, I've been torn on using it, but some of the trash in there really sucks. having bark for every part of the maze seems like it be better than worrying about having incarn up
[6:04:37] Klauzzer: theater is long
[6:04:40] brucezhu: They nerfed TW exp
[6:04:45] WoW_StandalonE: Thrall wiped on Twisting Corridors it seems, no mount for him
