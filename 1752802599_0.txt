[1:07:08] Crtvly: @Yunnerd Google FFZ+AP and download it, go to settings and badges I believe and find the sub badge/s and click hide or something
[1:07:08] heavy_l1fted: Shroud what raid you running first?
[1:07:09] isnv7: raids in d2 are probably top 5 best fps experiences of all times
[1:07:10] Jengels: Destiny = Life
[1:07:10] zagriid: yeah there's mechanic
[1:07:11] atom_ali_: you got way of topic LUL
[1:07:11] senorando: lol already a better raider than most people

[1:07:32] Crtvly: @Yunnerd You're welcome FutureMan
[1:07:33] 8bit_amethyst: The Titan has a different take
[1:07:33] Only_Domes: abilities are generally better than guns, you use guns when you don't have the abilities
[1:07:34] PowerfullVeganHands: I feel sad for everyone because shroud just agreed with me L to everyone
[1:07:36] jayagb: thinking about trying destiny, is it worth ?
[1:07:37] cycIon1337: @shroud what are your first impressions overall
[1:07:37] drunktractorgrandpa: And eventually you do it every week and it boring. The pvp holds the game together, and pvp is terrible

[1:07:52] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[1:07:52] iiTzBranndo: its just very repetittive
[1:07:53] Jengels: the grind and money extraction

[1:08:10] KronnickTV: I mean

[1:08:12] Marrowalk: That is not what you do in a raid
[1:08:15] KronnickTV: it kinda is
[1:08:16] Goatthulu: that's why i go to the range irl
[1:08:17] PlagueFPS: @GnashviLLe shush PepeLaugh
[1:08:17] xJonnnnY: Thats why raids are good
[1:08:19] PowerfullVeganHands: Whole chat who @ me just took a massive L lmao. I‚Äôm actually sad for you all
[1:08:20] Dog1esss: @Crtvly I mean there are always the days you feel like shit Sadge

[1:08:22] PROxRAIDEN: thats just you have shit guns LUL
[1:08:23] LonelyTwinkie: Learn build crafting and all you will do is use abilities
[1:08:23] bittyzx: ur not supposed to spam white ammo the whole time LUL
[1:08:25] Limp4ns: @bagofsins yeah its sad.. if u like the gameplay its a super cool game and if u dont just play something else

[1:08:28] GnashviLLe: @PlagueFPS nou Plagoo PepeLaugh
[1:08:28] Vkamaa: Raids and dungeons are more fun
[1:08:29] bagofsins: That‚Äôs cause you haven‚Äôt made any builds yet, ur a beginner @shroud
[1:08:31] isnv7: its extremely grindy, to be good and do actual endagame stuff you need to take it as a 9-5 and grind for very specific weapon rolls and build crafta lot
[1:08:32] 0ab_c: shroudDab shroudDab shroudDab
[1:08:32] Arbezi: Yea the Dlc bs for 60$ is disgusting
[1:08:33] qtchris: diff dopamine spike
[1:08:34] DomiNate_1: they fixed that with GrandMaster Nightfalls and Raids
[1:08:34] WheelandBlade: oopsie
[1:08:34] hate_xyz: unless you're a mage in classic LUL
[1:08:35] PhenxmenaL410: Raids, dungeons and Grandmasters are the best content in the game because it engages the brain and isn‚Äôt just mindless shooting
[1:08:36] rm00: @Lemur, ay March 24th is my birthday FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:08:37] AlixiumMusic: You have abilities. You have to use them to do anything in end game content. Its hard.
[1:08:38] ekkarr: u can have ability spam builds too
[1:08:39] Nasilvera: We having fun
[1:08:40] PlagueFPS: @GnashviLLe you destiny enjoyer or shrood enjoyer?

[1:09:26] Kleaveopatra: It's fine....it's all fine...oh fuck
[1:09:26] PlagueFPS: @GnashviLLe I have too many hours in this game, and I got tired of paying out the ass to do the same old shit KEKW
[1:09:27] 4kr3_: the game in itself is good, good liking for its age but give it 10-20 hours and it gets sooo repetitive
[1:09:27] Killapete232: Vow of the disciple is a very good raid as it incorporates very fun mechanics for a First Person Shooter definitely worth a try
[1:09:27] Flarest123: But some loot sucks or is behind a pay wall Madge
[1:09:29] Fyerie: I havent played d2 in a long time wtf is the green class

[1:09:32] PowerfullVeganHands: I‚Äôm actually sad that shroud just shit on everyone who @ me disagreeing that this game is any different end game vs start. Actual humanity NPCs in chat today
[1:09:38] PhenxmenaL410: Game isn‚Äôt the best for everyday grind but jumping in high level content with friends is a blast
[1:09:42] eAN619: @jayagb With all expansions yes, you will live in game. Vanilla is not worth it
[1:09:46] Lemur: the more you play and do activities the better loot/weapons you will get and the game becomes less "bullet spongey" and hella fun
[1:09:46] GnashviLLe: @PlagueFPS SAME honestly...but this new expansion looks fun and the cycle is dead :(
[1:09:50] effjesse: @PowerfullVeganHands what's a humanity npc?
[1:09:54] isnv7: the absolute best most sweaty things to do in this game are day 1 contest mode raids and low man raids
[1:09:55] ewarriorrr: @PowerfullVeganHands keep feeling sad
[1:09:56] cubonesmasqHD: Lol

[1:10:16] MrMarkius: its a new subclass you will get once you complete the story
[1:10:17] rm00: They have reworked it so you use less of your abilities this season, last season you barely had to use your guns @shroud

[1:10:35] zachampson: how can you fight the same enemies they had since the launch of this game???
[1:10:35] Only_Domes: you have a grenade on the other subclass though lol
[1:10:36] CasualKev: You like it now. Because you dont really have the cooldowns yet. Wait till you officially got this sub class and the cooldowns will be horrible
[1:10:38] pascon: use your grenades more
[1:10:39] WrecklessMH: this is the new subclass
[1:10:44] NoShame: awesome!!
[1:10:44] TheNameIsToast: Until you realise that when you are out of the story you have 2min cooldowns on everything, becomes way less fun LUL

[1:10:52] eAN619: @shroud will you play PVP later?
[1:10:53] vikingbeard21: As someone who has 2000 hours in this game strand is pretty good
[1:10:56] TKSilent: LUL
[1:10:58] ron_burgandy: This game only becomes fun when you reach the end game. Grand master nightfall, raids etc. @shroud
[1:11:03] vanat1c: @chat did shroud buy the DLC yet?
[1:11:04] NatePica: @Lawferry Oh really? So no grenades on that subclass?

[1:11:42] NatePica: Shoot his feet with the rockets bos man
[1:11:43] Killapete232: Unfortunately during the campaign you cannot change the subclass aspect and fragments which is the best part of the game ie Build Crafting like outriders
[1:11:43] rm00: Aiming that rocket gives you tracking @shroud

[1:20:19] Irduseer: you can but other activities are better
[1:20:19] trise5: @shroud your mic doesn't sound hd
[1:20:20] Diranar: but its rare
[1:20:20] crayze: You can add a mod to your ghost, which guarantees  +10 in stats of your choice. Basically you want 100 resil + 100 grenade as warlock.

[1:20:26] isnv7: 60+ is common its the repartition that matters @shroud
[1:20:26] McWinkleBottom: @shroud you only get better stats every 10, so 60 discipline is the same as 69
[1:20:28] PPzinSS: the rarest the content the better the odds
[1:20:28] easy4ver: only legend and master u will get hight stats
[1:20:29] Com1xguy: Ghost mod for certain stat spike as well
[1:20:29] IUNKNWNI: find 60+

[1:20:38] Razzmattazz__: @NoooScopee triple 100 is very unlikely now
[1:20:38] Willshaper_: keep it
[1:20:41] phoenixesrllyexist: some activites have higher chance to drop higher Total stat
[1:20:41] addy6666: Not In story but in other specific activities

[1:20:51] reusalfonso: There is a mod in your ghost that can focus on what stat you want
[1:20:53] M0rdu: I mean, you still want to keep low stat ones if they're high in the stats you're prioritizing @shroud
[1:20:53] anonymous_coconut99: depends on the stats you get
[1:20:53] BaboonTheBeamer: depends on what the stats that they are in yes

[1:21:10] dariwiththebigcherries: yep lmao
[1:21:10] Ultimate_Random: Depends you never want high mobility on warlock

[1:46:35] starkindle: @qwixdg its hard to say. At this point in the game lots of meta weapons are in those previous dlc which you do still need to buy. That being said you would still be able to make a perf viable raid build without but itll be harder
[1:46:37] generalcatburd: took me 14 tries on legendary

[1:46:48] PROxRAIDEN: you are basically doing it on legendary because you are low light
[1:46:49] caylenfoxboi: @shroud warlocks also have a healing nade if you feel like you need it

[1:55:31] RoboticAdi: wonder if shroud will consider doing a dungeon/raid
[1:55:34] jaimespots: monkaHmm like who? @traveldanielle
[1:55:36] Buellerton: Do you have to equip the items to improve the power of your gear or will it calc off your inventory?
[1:55:39] isnv7: @Mikoloro_ id say stasis but they removed some mods and kinda killed all good stasis builds, but more complete subclass as of rn
[1:55:41] Slicerslice: @Mikoloro_ Probably strand but too early to tell. Stasis already had a bunch of issues that are now worse after the mod changes.
[1:55:41] rynotoad: yo how is destiny so far?
[1:55:47] sodegurumajime: how many hours he got in the game?
[1:55:52] Jolom1te: Had anyone mentioned Icarus dash to Shroud?

[1:56:21] Overcast22: Yep
[1:56:21] youngbreadstick: @Buellerton it will auto calc based off potential light level
[1:56:22] Twiztid828: You can pay to skip leveling on your alt characters
[1:56:22] MooseKindaGuy: not really
[1:56:24] Crazygrimm: Or just buy the boost
[1:56:26] subtoxiic: its called Fun in destiny
[1:56:28] darthbaydah: thats if you want to do it rapid and fast

[1:56:32] Jo1un33r: Hold e in tank

[1:56:37] bagofsins: Real
[1:56:38] Overcast22: That‚Äôs how you get the good good
[1:56:40] apeontop_: You dont really need to do that to get the good shit
[1:56:40] CrazienautZERO: hold "E" to lovk on
[1:56:40] isnv7: shroud plays game as a living, he literally has time
[1:56:41] Jkist7: or just to be a chad GIGACHAD
[1:56:41] justhatip: This game booty
[1:56:42] PrivateSyaz: You can get away with 1 but 3 is good if you are willing
[1:56:42] sirzachari: You only really need 2 characters
[1:56:42] CabooZirzz: sacrifices must be made to be at the top
[1:56:44] Overcast22: Raid 3 times a week ain‚Äôt that bad
[1:56:44] blurTTV: get that good good
[1:56:45] gadnuk_breakerofworlds: you can grind it out without that
[1:56:48] Denx1: have fun burning yourself out LULW
[1:56:48] codeinecomet: No I don‚Äôt
[1:56:49] txtoast727: differences is like maybe a week or two
[1:56:51] BillyBucket_: Comp is a great way to level up as well shroud
[1:56:51] Tenn0zu: is this pvp
[1:56:53] Not_Flag: only raids really
[1:56:53] plasmuhcoral: triple character leveling is only good if you need to level extremely quickly for like worlds first stuff
[1:56:54] cantalbyte: are you going back to the cycle?
[1:56:54] Jo1un33r: Hold "E" in tank
[1:56:54] codeinecomet: No u dont
[1:56:56] bloomin_onion: nah you really dont, just a couple missions till you're not locked out of being able to freely access all content
[1:56:57] MageWrecker: u can keep up without doing it tbh
[1:56:57] cinderful: Naw, I don't need to. There are a million other ways. You can transfer weapons and then blue-gear boost your way up mostly
[1:56:58] WoIIah: It's the best strat for a world's first raid
[1:57:00] inquisitorgm: If you're hardcore, sure, do that
[1:57:00] Ultimate_Random: true you can't play an MMO and not fooking mid max LUL
[1:57:02] Mikoloro_: I'm doing it on 3 characters w/ different classes/subclasses. Can get grindy.
[1:57:03] Ukall: E
[1:57:06] raydialseeker: @Not_Flag Even raids are contest capped really low now
[1:57:08] papu_gianfru: whats ur thoughts on the campaing so far?
[1:57:08] traveldanielle: @shroud best way to get the good shit is find a solid fireteam. SO much faster to blow through campaign and pinnacles when theres 3 ppl
[1:57:10] Jkist7: If you absolutely want to get highest light fastest, yeah, 3 characters is necessary
[1:57:12] tacomaahaja: you should play come in this game in my opinion it‚Äôs the best PvP option
[1:57:13] MageWrecker: its not a huge necessity like in lost ark
[1:57:15] v3nomkm: It's a grind for sure in general.
[1:57:20] velekzi: chat what is the best mode to grind armor and guns?
[1:57:22] kngihthawk: which game is this?
[1:57:23] arn_ttv: u have to reach the soft cap first then equip ur other character
[1:57:26] sevsrr: how are you enjoying destiny? @shroud
[1:57:28] apeontop_: Do season activities, red borders, raids and dungeons, Strikes and nightfalls, trials of osiris, etc. Thats how u get the good shit
[1:57:29] WrecklessMH: @kngihthawk destiny 2
[1:57:29] isnv7: OGMA
[1:57:29] krowlzzz: Vehicles?
[1:57:31] tacomaahaja: I did all 3 campaigns honestly redoing it‚Äôs fun for me just bring in a gun u need to level up
[1:57:32] infxmousr: 3 fking ads wtf
[1:57:33] Fuzzy_Wuzzy: @RoboticAdi jsnLEWD
[1:57:34] RoboticAdi: it's definitely grindy, but it's not tooo bad
[1:57:35] isnv7: ogma gaming pog
[1:57:35] Jo1un33r: @kngihthawk destiny 2
[1:57:38] sir_eye_dough: Damn you can tell how much he's already picked up just since yesterday.
[1:57:40] papu_gianfru: whats ur thoughts on the campaing so far?
[1:57:41] LieutenantDamnn: also if you want to have higher light going in to the raid that used to be a factor, however i think there is competition mode now for raids first‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ so it equalizes everyone across the board for 24 hours.
[1:57:41] raydialseeker: @traveldanielle ayo not even watching datto lol
