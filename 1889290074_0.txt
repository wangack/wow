[5:54:19] t3official: rift
[5:54:21] timlo3: I would say PvP is harder to get into, cause you dont have stuff thats tailored for you. You are playing against people who has done the same thing for 20 years.

[12:06:36] coconust1: Do you know the chess move  en passant…? I learnt this existed after playing chess at 800 without knowing this
[12:06:52] Brerathiel: Once you learn the theory, and have some solid openers and play you can always just push to 1500 - 1800 without making too many adaptations.
[12:07:01] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[12:07:11] Brerathiel: To break that 1800 barrier you need to incorporate all the minute adaptations

[12:08:46] imbX__: a lot of good ones
[12:09:04] Brerathiel: I didn’t say it’s easy. I’m saying at that level it’s more about having a solid understanding of the theory you play. And you just perfect that theory. But after that you need to start incorporating a lot of different theory
[12:09:24] Brerathiel: It’s still a grind lol 😂
[12:09:27] lovelesschico: Cheer500 swifty i once saved the day in a battkeground many years ago in like one second left by getting the flag to point and i got messages from 3 pople saying i was awesome
