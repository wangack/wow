[2:22:19] sevens777s: why though ?
[2:22:25] TrowGundam: That shit should not be publically viewable. C'mon. It is like they are just asking to get most of their streamers banned

[2:22:42] Osowareru: yeah why are they able to see them, that's bs
[2:22:48] uglla3np: twitch signed a contract properly
[2:22:50] Raedari: The whole thing is kinda messed up considering (like you said) it's on Twitch servers, not on your page anymore.
[2:22:51] Shadowmental: @tow or chat can you tell me what you think the best brand of pc gaming headsets is?
[2:23:00] Slitze: sure they do
[2:23:01] MILESkg21: then what was the point in "DELETING"
[2:23:03] TrowGundam: Yes, Backups are good. Just not publically viewable.
[2:23:08] DieselDesigns: It will never be fixed from DMCA.
[2:23:11] Tehcooky: Wait isn‚Äôt this politics free?
[2:23:21] MysticRaven_: yeah syndicate got claimed for some clip that havent exsisted on his channel for years pretty dumb
[2:23:29] Qelvue: @Towelliee yeah, there's history that could be lost :O
[2:23:30] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @Towelliee I beleive if im not mistaken.....DMCA has the right to look and there isnt anything twitch can do about it
[2:23:49] Slitze: sure if a judge subpoenaed
[2:23:50] Exoduc: Probably concerns with breaking dmca and then covering it up by deleting vods, as shitty as that point of view is
[2:24:01] swampt1l: We aren‚Äôt talking about politics what @tehcooky
[2:24:03] xhaven: Its Politics that make the laws
[2:24:07] PToastman: wut
[2:24:09] swampt1l: We are talking about DMCA

[3:12:44] NexusOps: @coachingpotatoes yeah that makes sense. It's why I think the whole streamer house idea is just sad and pathetic. So is all the drama they drum up

[3:14:39] NexusOps: @coachingpotatoes I am sure they do. But making money and being pathetic are not mutually exclusive. Scammers who call old people about having viruses on their PCs and scam them out of money to "fix" their PC make money too. Doesn't mean they are not pathetic ;)

[3:17:06] NexusOps: @coachingpotatoes I never said they are scamming people. I just called their method of making money (putting teenagers in a house and waiting for the pot to boil over) pathetic. Nothing else :)

[4:45:47] OGgabyy: Thanks guys!
[4:45:47] DeadlyDag: Yeah, why would you get your data breached while using Overwolf @acee626 ? Keep hearing that, but they keep privacy a high priority - so I really don't get it.
[4:45:50] MILESkg21: LUL
[4:45:54] nolan0220: they probs have no interest because ur in completely different industries
[4:45:54] GrimmTroll: @towelliee what are you using to keep track of your mounts? i use simplearmory, its awesome but i miss that they dont display classmounts
[4:45:58] majorizc: Kapp

[4:46:39] Todmeister9000: Hank?
[4:46:44] kriticoal: I doubt south park even cares lol
[4:46:46] totallypayingattention: vod you say?
[4:46:46] Waylash: That's because South Park doesn't need to bother with that shit. They arn't losing money and you arn't losing money.
[4:46:46] trogger83: Trey Parker and Matt Stone would never be so shitty
[4:46:50] Shroodinho: arthas Pepehand
[4:46:53] DeadlyDag: That's not a breach at all @acee626 That's you using their software. No different compared the twitch-client fyi :)

[4:49:19] JontheCron: thats an oldie
[4:49:26] northcub: what are you farming for sir?
[4:49:27] DeadlyDag: @Eviltuna13 If you want the reliable addon-manager that will be the 'go-to' which is legal and will be stable, you use Overwolf Curseforge. It's official and won't be taken down. It's very similar to the twitch-client, only better, faster and more stable. If you want the lightweight version that updates ElvUI as well, then use WoWUP - but it will MOST likely be taken down after a while due to how it works.
[4:49:28] loommindless: 2001

[5:11:55] rapheeki93: @Towelliee when you doing your valhalla stream?
[5:11:59] Jac_MacK: but you need to buy it on ps5 if you want to play it on ps5
[5:11:59] rreaks: keeps your levels no matter what platform you play. guns, level, all of that will transfer over. @towlliee thats what that means
[5:12:04] MOLAR305: isnt cross gen ps4 -> ps5 but pc is xbox x?
[5:12:13] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Cross gen version is if you bought it on the Ps4, you can bring it to the Ps5 without paying again.
[5:12:14] mainetrev: still less than paying like 3-4 bucks for a monster
[5:12:22] lawles_walrus: all cross gen means is you can play on ps5 with ps4 people, the whole thing is crossplatform @Towelliee
[5:12:26] rreaks: Valhalla streams have started
[5:12:30] TigasLIVE: Did you saw the demon's souls state of play? @Towelliee

[5:12:53] Jac_MacK: yea u cant play it all
[5:13:03] Zolshy89: @Towelliee allows you to have it on lets say one X and series X, does not go from xbox to ps5 or pc
[5:13:05] TompsonX: I bet that Call of Duty would make so much money if they sold their games as a subscription instead
[5:13:11] Deafdude: Is this shadowlands beta or release?
[5:13:11] Jac_MacK: some ppl got xbox's already
[5:13:22] BiggTC: My friend got his series x yesterday

[5:13:29] Lantern214: @Towelliee Godfall is on PC in the epic store
[5:13:30] SpyCrabbo: neither @Deafdude
[5:13:37] Endin: PS5 controller is damn nice
[5:13:47] bigtwig48: Ratchet n clank
[5:13:48] Mufinz21: whats godfall?
[5:13:49] NILLme: you pay extra for the COD so you can play it on PS4 and PS5, no need to buy another copy
[5:13:49] Jac_MacK: I really like the ps5 controller
[5:13:51] TheBlueGreen: Godfall looks good but I'm scared it will be very generic
[5:13:52] Fiirkan: I need to try the haptic feedback on the PS5 controller
[5:13:54] rreaks: that cod thing means that you keep your levels no matter what platform you play. guns, level, skins, achievements all of that bs will transfer over. @towlliee thats what that means. but you dont get it for both platforms.
[5:13:55] Deafdude: hmm Soloing BFA raid as blood DK ü§î
[5:13:57] Jac_MacK: me too

[5:14:09] TompsonX: I couldn't get the PS5 preorder Sadge
[5:14:10] Masqerader: "The digital Ultimate Edition includes the base game Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War for both console generations within the same console family (PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 or Xbox One and Xbox Series X)" is what it says for the game
[5:14:11] Jac_MacK: I love the controller alot

[5:14:29] Jac_MacK: no I am fine
[5:14:33] NeoJon82: PS5 can work with other systems like Origin games, but it's clunky to setup and get working. Need to have Steam launch the other games app launcher, then launch the game. Then the controller works.
[5:14:36] rreaks: I'm afraid it'll end up like destiny, major ResidentSleeper

[5:24:31] TheAverageGoob: What do you like so much about console gaming? The controller? Okay...so hook that up to your computer?
[5:24:40] galnddra: wow is boring and i dont like wow anymore
[5:24:44] Aidler: imagine WoW VR
[5:24:52] Densetsu_: @Towelliee "Adaptive triggers in the L2 and R2 buttons will offer levels of resistance while gaming. Examples of this in action include the tension when pulling a bow string before firing an arrow and being able to differentiate between the feel of a machine gun and a shotgun"
[5:24:53] DiranJei: @galnddra ok
[5:24:59] Frankenclyde: remember when WoW was rumored to be coming to console back in the 360 PS3 era? people actually created mods that allowed you to play with a controller on PC
[5:24:59] MILESkg21: not yet Kappa
[5:24:59] BowSec: I always turn off vibration to save battery... and stop being salty about the Xbox series x @towelliee
[5:25:06] Mufinz21: god i can't wait for the new god of war

[5:25:12] Vitalsigns64: God of War is so good Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[5:25:14] Uglyfoot: I have a gaming computer but I am still getting a Series X. Like to play some games from my couch on 75in 4k tv
[5:25:21] rreaks: The new xbox is so bad its crazy. I dont understand why people want to flush their money. they can take that $500-600 and upgrade their PC lol. theres no reason game wise and especially not hardware wise. PS5 is the only next gen console actually making games.
[5:25:23] MILESkg21: when sony stops being a little bitch Kappa
[5:25:26] msmester1: im waiting for ps5 god of war edition Kreygasm

[5:25:58] Mister5ky: i buy the Xbox to get the fullest of my Gamepass
[5:26:06] Ghostpuddlez: i dont think all the game are able to play on pc are they?
[5:26:11] Powerofwar_1: Some people dont have a PC @towelliee
[5:26:18] TyndiVelspaz: Should I upgrade my PC when WoW forces me to play on graphics level 1?
[5:26:23] MILESkg21: OMEGALUL
[5:26:25] Mufinz21: not like xbox has good exclusives anymore anyways, recent halos have all been trash
[5:26:25] DisquietedCollector: Sometimes I just want to play other places than my desk, and the Xbox makes it easy to go back and forth
[5:26:36] Masqerader: People still running Pentium 3 or some shit
[5:26:38] rillo5: Some people do just to play with their friends I think because a lot of games still aren‚Äôt cross play
[5:26:40] Frankenclyde: @SkidMarkLucy so does the steam link
[5:26:41] Jac_MacK: I have a pc and upgrade it regularly cause PC is my first platform, I get the ps5 just for exclusives .
[5:26:45] NILLme: console is plug and play, PC is install driver, update driver, update game, game broke, fix it
[5:26:54] Mecabeast: my xbox is for watching things now

[5:27:08] Razb: steam has hardware survey
[5:27:11] MILESkg21: xbox is a netlfix player OMEGALUL
[5:27:13] titohax: steam tracks computer specs
[5:27:16] UnorthodoXgameer: xbox doesnt really care where u play ur games as long as ur in the eco system so win win for pc and console just doesnt matter ne more:LD
[5:27:18] Melb1n: Also now you can take the 2 year gamepass sub and get the xbox with it. good for ppl who dont have good comp
[5:27:18] BowSec: Listen... I have a rig that can play anything myself. I‚Äôve purchased both the Xbox series x and the PlayStation 5 in order to enjoy games with my kids... your being biased
[5:27:24] kriticoal: memba xbox kinect KEKWlaugh
[5:27:25] jawnskii_: my xbox is literally for netflix prime video disney + hulu and all that

[5:28:22] Jac_MacK: it is soeasy for us old head pc gamers .. todays PC games are so easy ..it is a console basically ... back in the 80's and 90's gaming was a labor of love
[5:28:23] msmester1: i would rather have 1080p 60fps than 4k 30 4Head

[5:29:15] brawnyneckbeard: too soon :((((
[5:29:17] JoeOnAir: I'd buy the xbox if I could dual boot into windows 10. It would be a great deal for that kind of hardware
[5:29:17] galnddra: fight night champion is only for the xbox
[5:29:23] Jac_MacK: yea they never capitalized on that platform
[5:29:31] Lockrocker: because they gave Ninja all the money. they couldnt afford too
[5:29:33] galnddra: and that is why i wanna buy xbox for fighting fight night champion i have a good pc @Towelliee
[5:29:33] MILESkg21: they thought buy shroud and ninja would help it

[5:29:57] rreaks: @xarvesh true, it is cheaper if your compairing brand new shit. but if you have a PC, you can get a new GPU and cpu for the price of an xbox and be able to run 4k on your PC. especially with the new GPU's and CPU's. you'll be able to get a 2000 series GPU for cheap af.
