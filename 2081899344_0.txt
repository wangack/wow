[0:14:04] allport22: ngl you guys proved EU>NA - beating even on NA servers is huge W
[0:14:37] gltm2022: the game you  lost to liguid 2vs3 was due to overcofidence?
[0:14:55] allport22: @gltm2022 lontar had 0 mana

[0:17:02] AsdOfc: Fire just isnt what it used to be Sadge
[0:17:14] iiiidan1994: why wahaaz dont play  rog aginst rogs .d
[0:17:15] honsou2: @nightmoonx11 hard to prove that on a DH while DH is the most broken thing ever
[0:17:18] iiiidan1994: pika has bolls
[0:18:06] nightmoonx11: @honsou2 He's proven it year after year on whatever he plays, he's definitely better than whaazz but whaazz is just more  of a leader and insane game communicator, but as a player raiku is better IMO
[0:18:22] AsdOfc: pika plays 1 comp its not like he had any choice @iiiidan1994
[0:18:33] nightmoonx11: @Raikubest Would you try Rogue Shuffle r1 challenge?
[0:18:35] Ezslay: Hi what you say do you play cata classic or you stay retail?
[0:18:39] honsou2: @nightmoonx11 right i have no opinion on that, just cant prove to be better by playing DH during full DH meta
[0:18:41] vaniteaDH: lontars play in the last game was so good with the knock lasso
[0:19:01] gltm2022: Best Mage..best Dh ...time to try some healing bro :P

[0:21:41] iiiidan1994: whaaz was scared right

[0:22:19] iiiidan1994: whose the best rouge tell the truth
[0:22:25] Zissuri14: @nightmoonx11 saying 5 times in a row "insane dmg now" is not good communication its anoying at best
[0:22:39] yodaaxx: yoo raiku beast gz on the win bro happy for you guys @Raikubest
[0:22:51] zhooldan: can u link the best shuffle specc for frost?

[0:23:10] infernion: And what about Nalaa?
[0:23:19] citricxy: what your name yozora mean
[0:23:20] iiiidan1994: pika is so smart he brings the impossible but they have 1 coob and dh owns sprist
[0:23:28] citricxy: @raikubest isn’t pshero the best rogue tho
[0:23:37] infernion: D:
[0:23:41] salk76: jokrdBrow
[0:23:42] infernion: I mean ye Nalaa is bronze in league ofc

[0:24:24] Deficez: @fefefen he played retail for years didn't crush anything but noobs
[0:24:36] archtme: I think whaaz more than anyone has the best "game sense", he almost always seems to know what needs to be done to win
[0:24:38] bijinbok: U got any tips for a beginner dh player?
[0:24:39] suchskillmuchimpress: will you remember DF as the worst pvp expac ever :D
[0:24:39] honsou2: @infernion playing wow rn is a crazy choice
[0:24:45] fefefen: pshero numba wan
[0:25:00] honsou2: @suchskillmuchimpress its slightly better than SL
[0:25:03] nightmoonx11: @suchskillmuchimpress its the best in terms of Solo shuffle being added. But balancing is 1/10, fcking awful
[0:25:16] nightmoonx11: @Raikubest What happened to Prev/Drake team?
[0:25:19] suchskillmuchimpress: @honsou2 I don't think so, at least not the first 2 seasons

[0:27:37] archtme: did fuseton pick up rsham recently or did he play it for a long time?
[0:27:39] allport22: Clyde is OP priest
[0:27:39] iiiidan1994: but lontar payed insane every1 surprised
[0:28:05] provo2100: If DH gets nerfed will we see more arcane?
[0:28:06] nikojej: its a shame that Hydra stopped arenas. Only sod nowadayus
[0:28:12] fedayn72roma: Spirit in solo, is that someone that played awc before?
[0:28:25] nightmoonx11: @Raikubest Akro or Whaazz

[0:29:32] provo2100: Makes sense
[0:29:33] nightmoonx11: @Raikubest Who do you think Top 5 Warlocks are? IMO Chan/Snutz are easily nr1
[0:30:40] tony1992qt: maldiva?
[0:30:42] fefefen: bualock?
[0:30:56] nightmoonx11: @fefefen this
[0:30:59] ryanjordanrj: bro said maldvia
[0:31:03] bijinbok: What counters dh!
[0:31:05] Zissuri14: i was surprised that raiku was the one playing dh in awc, cause whazz said on his stream that he is better melee player than raiku
[0:31:10] nightmoonx11: @bijinbok Going on him
[0:31:13] archtme: I hope that 300k tournament is on lan
[0:31:29] nightmoonx11: @nightmoonx11 at least in Shuffle XD
[0:31:30] iiiidan1994: ur playing dh very good but not insane its  hard to be insane on dh

[0:33:01] yodaaxx: raiku when is the next tourny bro ? @Raikubest
[0:33:03] salk76: Do you think theres any class that's not reaching it's full potential, due to its lack of good representation?
[0:33:08] Zissuri14: @iiiidan1994 raiku is arcane mage main Kappa
[0:33:10] incomingwar95123: thanks
[0:33:12] yuriuxd: whats the diff between an insane dh and a good one

[0:33:50] infernion: I swear people were trying to scapegoat your DH so bad lol??? It's only Elswave and Coffey that's better and they main it?
[0:34:02] rdvalasalle: One thing i also found idk but all those MS problems impact alot mana management , idk lontar was ooming so much faster.
[0:34:11] salk76: Sounds reasonable
[0:34:20] salk76: Better teamplayer

[0:37:42] yodaaxx: was it super laggy for you guys? @Raikubest
[0:37:43] blinkers89: but maybe because it was eu

[0:41:52] awesomeraff: Hi, just entered chat, what ms did you have?
[0:42:36] camgirlxo: nothing linked with pvp in this game barely makes sense any more
[0:42:56] Ephixza: Blizzard should make a lan tourney imo, the have the money.
[0:43:38] kebablover55555: they have money for lan tourney but no money for pvp dev
[0:44:25] vothros: why did they stop tournaments in blizzcon?
[0:44:28] salk76: What do you think the next class will be? :)
[0:44:30] Ephixza: Is having contract with echo sufficient for you not to stream, financial wise ?
[0:47:26] Ephixza: If Blizz would contact you for full time job at the development team for pvp, would you quit stream for it ?
[0:47:51] cristianliotto: Hey Raiku, were u playing ele shaman yesterday ?

[1:00:29] maijoz: @ImbaxTV A rotation bot or what does that mean?
[1:01:03] ImbaxTV: he sits novas, he doesnt shift when slowed(he prefer staying cat for the whole time and then as soon as he get close he start cast clones)
[1:01:17] ImbaxTV: he turn around right after the clone casted in cat form
[1:01:29] Ephixza: he is two times glad/legend

[1:02:11] maijoz: S2 SL doesnt count as Glad
[1:02:13] Taaeel: sitting some nova's doesnt mean he is botting
[1:02:15] ImbaxTV: he didnt miss

[1:18:29] elswavee: would u say there was more competiton in this tourney than bfor or nah
[1:19:19] slickdaddyg69: I love the EU vs NA rivalry
[1:19:24] suchskillmuchimpress: bit sad that all this work and first place is not much money

[1:22:45] sind233: tunings LUL
[1:22:45] aangmage: i see grats on tourny
[1:22:47] sind233: What is that
[1:22:57] Eradas123: yeah 100%
[1:23:34] elswavee: ye thats crazy they made it west
[1:23:39] neczotv: Yo where is your transmog set from?
[1:23:44] neczotv: its so sick!
[1:23:44] Eradas123: cross region is definetly the most hype tourney but it sucks if its online
[1:23:48] Eradas123: maaybe east coast is fine
[1:24:18] Feuerbuechse: @raikubest is the Best mage world wide ❤️
[1:24:43] elswavee: ye i see i guess it would be completely unplayabe
[1:24:49] elswavee: unplayable
[1:24:49] sind233: Blizzard the move fans confirmed
[1:24:52] Emiliiooz: so have you talked about the 3v2 scenario?
[1:25:35] uffdatsdirty: when do we see raiku at mdi?
[1:25:41] Feinton: i just watched the first echo vs liquid game that was insane holy moly
[1:26:57] elswavee: like i dont wana complain either too much but we didnt wg a single time so i just thought it was going too be normal na ping but it was unreal bad and didnt expect it too be like that
[1:27:07] FoxiekittenWoW: lontar said earlier today that the ping wasn´t as bad as he expected and that he thought it was very playable
[1:27:23] Feinton: @FoxiekittenWoW its probably very different from melee to ranged
[1:27:44] azliaris1: can you call your contacts in the dev team to finally nerf dh now
[1:27:49] azliaris1: holy shit
[1:27:55] FoxiekittenWoW: you just said it was unplayable?
[1:27:55] elswavee: Haha yes
[1:28:09] Wingardpvp: Any knows what happened to Friedkitteh? I cant remember the last time i saw him play
[1:28:12] Ev0hz: that sounds awful lol
[1:28:13] Eradas123: its just kinda sad cause i think our series vs liquid would go a bit different if it wasnt west coast
[1:28:17] Eradas123: we got unreal shit on every game on NA
[1:28:24] Eradas123: and on EU the games felt good
[1:28:25] kebablover55555: so its best to play high mastery low haste when you have high ping?
[1:28:47] uffdatsdirty: imagine facing mind trauma sp and affli lock at west coast servers
[1:28:53] Eradas123: yeah it was
[1:29:19] elswavee: they had good seeding so they get 1st game on na i feel like that game matters the most
[1:29:44] FoxiekittenWoW: but yea the ping obviously was a factor for sure. The funny thing is that cdew also said afterwards that they didn´t lose  a single game on eu due to ping, eventho they only won 1 game on eu the entire tournament.
[1:29:50] Eradas123: u know we thought ww dh would counter outlaw boomie, sowe pick it first game and we never got shit on harder LUL

[1:48:39] kooskoos_91: Hi, is it really so difficult to learn how to play arcane as some ppl pretend?

[1:52:14] raven1103: It is today that changes normally come or was it last night...................... @Raikubest ?
[1:53:12] KingMusicalMel: Pretty sure if we dont get post-awc changes, we're not getting any lol
[1:53:56] azliaris1: the fact that they dont is really bad
[1:54:01] Parnax: yea but they had a lot of time to prepare the changes and just release them after the AWC ended no? @Raikubest
[1:54:08] azliaris1: they havent balancned for 5 weeks why dont they have a list by now?
[1:54:09] 9hoowl: ye finals in mdi
[1:54:10] raven1103: @Raikubest Yea but just put "Only affects PVP"
[1:54:53] azliaris1: if only they could have this thing called "tournament realm" that doesnt affect live
[1:55:01] azliaris1: insane concept blizz pay me
[1:55:39] cubiis: I before we get 0 changes

[1:56:15] LeyIagosa: Didnt u say youre going to bed asap? :D
[1:56:32] azliaris1: league has the same thing where they have balance tunings every 2 weeks but it doesnt affect live
[1:56:35] KingMusicalMel: How come you were up so early anyway
[1:56:40] RoccaDiggi: I think there will be no changes, but patch will be announced, which will have balance changes
[1:56:42] azliaris1: cause they have brains and use a tournament realm
[1:56:59] BludlockFS: i think arena is great.. theres always something OP. DH does need some nerf but as a Warlock I have more trouble with Arms Warrior.
[1:57:00] KingMusicalMel: A demon schedule LOL
[1:57:34] KingMusicalMel: I work nightshifts and it's so aids on my days off cause I try to force myself to wake up so I don't spend my days off sleeping all day
[1:57:51] blueberrypieface: lul
[1:58:24] blinkers89: lontar had burgir only after tourney
[1:58:28] blinkers89: thats the most concerning
[1:58:37] originalhellfish: congrats on the tourny win, this was definitely the best awc series to watch so far
[1:58:38] LeyIagosa: now that is alarming
[1:58:58] KingMusicalMel: RWF must be a demon schedule too
[1:59:11] Guelag: were you bricked out the wazoo in finals bruv
[1:59:47] blinkers89: juicer detected

[2:00:16] Guelag: hes not wrong kekLEO
[2:00:28] Guelag: on that Gfuel boutta bust
[2:00:49] mpresz: outlaw good but its not sitting behind pillar 1 v 2ing like DH is
[2:00:59] blinkers89: @Guelag bomba
[2:01:06] jabarak93: outlaw is better then dh, but harder to play
[2:01:12] KJKtv: everyone ive ever spoke to whos on test all regret it, ur basically gunna be on it ur whole life after that or ur natural levels go to shit without it
[2:01:16] Caehwynu: is 10.6 the new season start?
[2:01:20] TeeNoodle: magic snowball diff honestly
[2:01:41] mpresz: DH is also like 5 button class lol
[2:01:41] KingMusicalMel: You seen this happen at all recently? I remember it a lot in legion, but seen it happen to Zeepeye the other day
[2:01:42] KingMusicalMel: ***
[2:01:58] 9hoowl: warcraft lives, details bugged or?
[2:02:04] blinkers89: juicer in twitchterms is referred to a xqc fan...

[2:02:13] blinkers89: KEKW
[2:02:16] BludlockFS: Yeah.. I wonder what the secret event of 10.2.6 is.
[2:02:25] Garthd: once you're middle age+ you need TRT anyway, to keep levels good/high
[2:02:38] blinkers89: @Garthd thats not true. its completely genetic

[2:03:05] BludlockFS: Ah yes.. I never considered that. It works from the POV.
[2:03:20] Bodhisage: casters love to talk about dmg intresting
[2:03:23] blinkers89: @Garthd ofc
[2:03:33] deanoxs: so depending on the devs pov it counts to their dmg or not
[2:03:41] Garthd: @blinkers89 naah
[2:04:48] blinkers89: @Garthd it depends ofc. if have been on peds then u will probably need it. u can have completely normal and healthy test levels
[2:05:06] raven1103: might legit soon just start to use ATH xD Like seeing how many bots there are also is insane and really don't feel like they are doing anything against it
[2:05:10] blinkers89: ofc they get lower but that doesnt mean they arent ´´good´´
[2:05:42] Kezople: Did you see dune part 2? I really enjoyed it
[2:05:46] Kezople: and I kinda hated the first movie lol
[2:05:48] deanoxs: thats why cdew said they stick with trill, because he is not the best set up player but pumps
[2:05:58] Kezople: i would recommend to go, it was insane
[2:05:59] KingMusicalMel: In your opinion what are some changes that need to happen
[2:06:12] MarthozTv: Did you ever play warrior raiku?
[2:06:16] raven1103: @Kezople I'm going thursday, and looking forward to it despite i didn't like first one, but only heard good reviews on 2nd
[2:06:30] MarthozTv: Cool
[2:06:38] Kezople: @raven1103 yea the 2nd is like 10 times better than 1st
[2:06:45] Kezople: it was so good
[2:06:56] harrison0192: legit a 2hour movie where its just about to start
[2:07:09] Kezople: i think its rated insane too already on imdb
[2:07:14] Garthd: Aquaman 2 was not it
[2:07:15] mr_walrusss: aquaman is good
[2:07:16] Kezople: like top 10 or smth of all movies
[2:07:17] Ninemmglock: Watch shogun
[2:07:18] BludlockFS: Have you watched Rebel Moon on Netflix? Part 2 comes out in April.
[2:07:18] raven1103: @Raikubest What website do u use to watch aquaman 2 ?

[2:14:40] Skyle_win: do you have updated thoughts on frost vs arcane? (in say: MLD with demo)?
[2:15:05] beegotten: I miss when raikoo flying boralus, old days pvp
[2:15:06] kjoeller1234: do you have a command for you DH armory
[2:15:12] KJKtv: i swear if fire wasnt as squish it would be rlly good right
[2:15:19] KingMusicalMel: I remember back in MoP getting hype at Hansol fire vids lmfao
[2:15:19] KJKtv: it seems like so much damage sometimes
[2:15:20] conman_tv: MMR? Dh? Buffs? Blissard?
[2:15:27] Raikubest: Ráiku
[2:15:29] Raikubest: Raikudh
[2:15:39] R1klus: what are the key points that make arcane so much better than fire and frost? or is it something wrong with fire and frost?
[2:15:47] raven1103: Time to get TwitchAdblock SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:15:58] deanoxs: what makes you love mage that much?
[2:16:15] Dexlol123: what comp would you played into kubzy team if u faced them?
[2:16:42] man0litos: @deanoxs try arcane, and you ll see
[2:16:45] mattyxoqt: Have you had a chance to look at the mage hero talents?
[2:16:51] KJKtv: arcane is probs the most frustrating thing to try kill as melee
[2:16:56] Guelag: ¨playing mage opposed to a lock reflects on his massive veiny dong @deanoxs
[2:16:58] KJKtv: i could just be playing it wrong
[2:17:10] Dexlol123: i was scared after losing all the wgs into you but then was not that much
[2:17:11] phantomhunterxz: why Chan doesn't want to play affli? It could be so good against certain setups, like evokers can't do shit
[2:17:22] raven1103: Idk if its bait but seeing r1 for some tank speccs is like 1800 that seems like by far the easiest way to get r1 in shuffle
[2:17:29] Joke_Fistweaver: what lobby does arcane not do well in shuffle?
[2:17:38] kjoeller1234: thanks raiku :)
[2:17:44] Dexlol123: all wins
[2:17:46] Dexlol123: for your team xD
[2:17:49] Dexlol123: LUL
[2:18:04] Dexlol123: yeah
[2:18:21] deanoxs: but isnt it super annoying that everyone is trying to catch your ass every fkn game
[2:18:37] Skyle_win: and BM ^^
[2:18:39] KJKtv: does any melee do well into arcane?
[2:18:54] Dexlol123: if rshaman grounding at the end of touch of magi it redirects the dmg?
[2:19:18] Joke_Fistweaver: if priest was S tier, would that make mage insane?
[2:19:21] Fizzibubele: feral aswell?
[2:19:27] KJKtv: the one melee i dont play D:
[2:19:45] Caehwynu: i swear hunter has no hard counters, maybe outlaw too
[2:20:03] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: @Raikubest wtf do i kick/parry vs arcane mage as warrior
[2:20:09] KJKtv: @Caehwynu what hunter spec?
[2:20:15] R1klus: which would oyu say is better rsham/mw for destro/arcane 3s ?
[2:20:16] Caehwynu: all 3
[2:20:19] man0litos: @Joke_Fistweaver really?? no way, how does that work
[2:20:32] KJKtv: i mean MM kinda gets destroyed by outlaw and monk
[2:20:33] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Raiku
[2:20:49] Caehwynu: yeah as i typed that i realised mm disarm
[2:20:55] KJKtv: haha
[2:21:29] Caehwynu: but bm and sv, outlaw i swear has no hard counters everything is winnable
[2:21:38] deanoxs: i think if you can land a kick right after surge that would be ideal
[2:21:52] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: @Raikubest how does touch of the magi work, seems to do nothing then one shot me lmfao
[2:22:27] AllyanaGaming: isnt it 20 ?
[2:22:27] beegotten: @Raikubest I'm doing something wrong, because I feel like I'm doing more frost damage than arcane damage.
[2:22:39] codycodez12: @Raikubest  can you explain how blink works? NotLikeThis
[2:22:50] KJKtv: so ideally u just kick on arcane or cc soon as they get touch off?
[2:22:54] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: ah like zed ult on league
[2:22:56] AllyanaGaming: i see
[2:23:02] blinkers89: @KJKtv surge
[2:23:05] blinkers89: touch is instant
[2:23:12] KJKtv: ohhh
[2:23:14] KJKtv: ok
[2:23:19] blinkers89: touch is usually just used to get 4 arcane charges insta
[2:23:27] deanoxs: so you want tough surge pump ?
[2:23:32] deanoxs: *touch
[2:23:33] man0litos: you have to unload for almost all of its duration to hit for aroun 200 k at best
[2:23:41] blinkers89: the more arcane charges the mage has the more pump arcane blast does
[2:24:09] Joke_Fistweaver: I still think legion arcane was the best design
[2:24:31] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: @Raikubest ye idk deva and arcane i cant stand playing vs as warrior
[2:25:02] idced: How good is 4 set for arcane?
[2:25:04] man0litos: i think mages can never go back to not playing shimmer
[2:25:05] blinkers89: i like this iteration of arcane the best aswell...
[2:25:10] Joke_Fistweaver: legion arcane in a nutshell was 1 missiles would do 90% of someones hp
[2:25:10] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: impossible uptime
[2:25:12] blinkers89: @idced its very important
[2:25:17] KJKtv: i think the mage knock tilts me more than anything
[2:25:29] KJKtv: seems a bit too much as well as the rest of the kit they have to kite
[2:25:40] bettertoploses: do you think DH is as overpowered as people point it out? i feel like in higher rated 3's you can just die inside a stun randomly as dh
[2:26:31] KJKtv: i wish feral was not completely reliant on clones to do damage
[2:26:33] idced: @blinkers89 I was trying to play arcane but got really tilted sine my damage wasa really low, don't have the 4 set yet though
[2:26:35] KJKtv: its so fun to play
[2:26:43] blackvpnv: when u see trille he was doing close to same dmg as dh and with all the cc its harder to play
[2:27:14] blinkers89: @idced jea it makes quite a difference but all in all arcane dmg just needs quite some setup
[2:27:32] blinkers89: @blinkers89 if u want to really delete someone

[2:27:56] blackvpnv: idk what pvp change they will do
[2:28:04] blackvpnv: its long time nothing change
[2:28:35] frazzoqt: think arms+dh+hpal is a decent ladder comp?
[2:28:37] Nextrkw: we run it back as RPS?
[2:28:43] Nextrkw: swear its OP COPIUM
[2:28:44] originalhellfish: and the most important question, will we see an mmr buff before next season? :D
[2:28:54] Skyle_win: when patch =)?
[2:28:59] Nextrkw: i spoke to admins and theyre nerfing sham extremely hard

[2:31:02] challesKo: 350mb patch wtf
[2:31:02] blinkers89: raiku how to u keep track of concentration?
[2:31:17] blinkers89: i get griefed sometimes when i think my next missiles is 4set and then
[2:31:20] blinkers89: i have concentration
[2:31:20] beegotten: @Raikubest It's possible use the old arcane missels animation? (Legion)
[2:31:24] blinkers89: paluCringe
[2:31:33] MartyrTV1: was rly weird
[2:31:38] MartyrTV1: vanguard was popular at early season
[2:31:41] MartyrTV1: and then disappeared
[2:31:41] beegotten: Thanks
[2:31:44] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: @Raikubest is it even possible to go arcane as warrior? uptime is too unreal bad
[2:31:44] MartyrTV1: this ssn
[2:32:17] SPENFROMTHEBLOCK: do u not just pump meters too hard?
[2:32:27] allport22: unless youre a demon hunter that is batman
[2:32:54] Miyagix: what you think of trills dmg on rog?

[2:34:15] Miyagix: and has insane comms
[2:34:21] sind233: Whaazz is good as being the coach LUL
[2:34:29] Miyagix: trill is always best on dmg haha
[2:34:33] beegotten: I hate this guy ''Whaaz''... He only post delicious foods on IG fffff
[2:34:33] archtme: I think whaazz reads the game better than anyone
[2:34:34] Miyagix: KEKW
[2:34:36] alfontv: LUL
[2:34:40] serenity1v9: pikab OMEGALUL
[2:34:52] allport22: heard pika is frustrating to play with as he doesnt track his shit properl;y lol
[2:34:53] originalhellfish: @archtme 100% agree
[2:35:21] sind233: I got one better, pikas setup, whaazz understanding of the game and trills dmg
[2:36:37] Miyagix: i feel like pika insane at doing random swaps off script
[2:36:37] allport22: apparently he is terrible and tracking his stuff though - will say like 'got this in 5 seconds' and sterge has to say its 20 or some shit
[2:37:11] archtme: @originalhellfish and it's very obvious too, he precalls like everything, haven't seen any other stream do it like that
[2:37:34] sind233: game 1 theres no way they shouldnt win
