[0:26:52] foofightersboi: do u play convoke for dps and tree for healing where necessary? not sure which dungeon requires which talent
[0:28:17] Notfuton: jdotbJAMMY jdotbJAMMY
[0:29:33] foofightersboi: ohh u play convoke around tree proc
[0:36:12] Sheepamig: sadge
[0:41:48] Jogiboio: !talents
[0:43:45] nevotheless: yes its correct, it was tied to the doors being open but they just forgot them when opening the doors
[0:48:28] pranders1: next season I'm hardcore gearing my druid, I feel like I'm too late now, its only 456 and I don't have it in me to farm I think
[0:50:40] tvilk: tvilk watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:50:42] Paveru_Hakase: massive comboost
[0:51:20] Kyocere: @pranders1 theres plenty of time.
[0:51:39] tvilk: @pranders1 It's definitely not too late to gear. I just reached 486 on my druid without taking a single step into mythic raid
[0:52:00] atedeV: !wa

[0:52:45] Dyez: Dyez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:52:46] pranders1: @tvilk yeah maybe I'll run heroic and some keys, but there's so much crests to be farmed
[0:53:21] tvilk: @pranders1 imo they come pretty naturally since you're already running keys for gear
[0:53:57] tvilk: I geared my DH tank to 485 in 3 weeks and in less than a month i maxed on aspects

[0:54:16] tvilk: yeah its a lot of keys to do, but then again.. isn't keys the reason you like playing?
[0:54:59] CrerisRs: ye but running 11s for crests isnt exactly interesting lol
[0:55:13] tvilk: thats why you dont run 11s and just do the hc raid instead
[0:55:42] Kadyen: does any1 have his threatplates config?
[0:55:45] CrerisRs: fair, but thats only like 150 crests per week or thereabout
[0:56:01] tvilk: yeah but you don't need that many Wyrms to upgrade your hero track gear
[0:56:16] tvilk: If you do 18s you get 2/6 hero track, meaning only 1 upgrade requires wyrms
[0:58:47] CrerisRs: 19s for 2/6 but ye thats like 1 or 2 heroic clears, probably gonna take you that long to just get the base items anyways
[0:59:01] tvilk: exactly
[0:59:37] tvilk: the hardest part is getting into keys, especially if you're looking to dps

[1:01:05] tvilk: Having played week 1 I know it was very possible to do +20 with <450 ilvl gear, so I am never too worried about doing those keys on new alts with rat gear.
[1:01:09] tvilk: The worry comes from being mentally drained sitting waiting for people to sign up to my key
[1:01:32] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:02:42] Fearcelol: @tvilk there should just be auto inv function, its really draining spending 20+ minutes looking at group finder every time
[1:02:52] tvilk: yep
[1:03:16] tvilk: That's the sole reason I switched to Healer/Tank this season. I don't even like playing healer or tank. I like playing dps, but I spend 20 min between each key trying to find groups
[1:03:28] tvilk: on tank or healer I get into a key less than 2 min after defeating last boss
[1:03:42] TitanDwarfGMS: Is that verdant tether any good for m+ ? I'm currently just using the boots as a embelishment
[1:04:20] cjayen: how do healers feel about playing a role that is there just to fill numbers?
[1:04:38] tvilk: @TitanDwarfGMS None of the embellishment are "good" for healer m+.. They're all kinda mid so there's very little gain in swapping around

[1:43:16] IstoleYoBike: oof
[1:43:20] ren0m: How are keys going?
[1:45:14] camshreds: @tvilk idk if this is sound advice if you're taking photosynthesis

[1:47:02] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:47:09] tvilk: Verdancy can carry your healing during high damage intake. Lifebloom on yourself isnt bad but it depends on the situation
[1:48:04] xen0phics: @tvilk lifebloom always on urself for burst aoe healing windows with flourish. you cant rely on verdancy procs in 3s window
[1:51:30] ren0m: Can you quickly show SP damage breakdown please.
[1:53:52] ren0m: Got it thank you
[1:55:10] coldsarsparilla: So Jdotb, are all of the mythic plus dungeons for this season in World of Warcraft Dragonflight all dungeons from previous expansions? So the competitive m+ scene isn't even dungeons from Dragonfight?

[2:57:26] BingoTingler: @brewteafulgaming Item level is a poor measurement to determine the capabilities of a tank in a key. The players skill will change the answer to your question.
[2:59:14] Bearform1235: @brewteafulgaming You can tank 20s with 23ish gear
[2:59:52] Bearform1235: But you'll need to play up your own key as no one wants to invite you

[6:16:06] Milanesa_De_Pollo: When he say that?

[6:18:54] reippailija: so midnight it is then
[6:19:03] Fizzbot125: Yea, that says a squish between TWW and Midnight
[6:19:10] Korentice: relevant part - “We’re going to have some pretty large numbers [in The War Within],” Hazzikostas said, “but they are comparable to numbers that we saw in Legion.” However, Midnight, the following expansion, will likely need to have a squish to prevent numerical bloat.
[6:19:57] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Also getting one less tier in the new few expos

[6:54:30] theskot: fall apart?
[6:54:39] monntuu: have they dropped a date? i mean
[6:54:58] Gondawn: The point some ppl make is that some people want to raid fated and some don't, so that causes guilds to split
[6:55:13] metafotm: fated is just major burnout
[6:55:37] monntuu: BDG explains why they are,  i think were going to see more people leave race because how much and how many toons you have to keep and maintain

[6:55:51] theskot: just taking fated casually then if its that bad
[6:56:39] Webchika: Granted my guild is a heroic guild and we're a casual heroic group... I have a TON of peps excited for Fated because we've been a landing spot for people who are stepping down from mythic / returning after a season or more away ... So I've got half a raid group who didn't raid in Season 1 and or 2 so they're excited to see the raids

[7:14:03] Snaaade: Am i the only one who would like some kind of wishlist for vault? So demotivating farming 6 options on several toons just to get slapped in the face
[7:14:04] xXFlow29Xx: when it will begin like may ?
[7:14:04] ren0m: So you had to raid to then buy an item you didn't get?
[7:14:55] theskot: everyone likes bad luck protection
[7:15:49] Zircons: everyone likes deterministic bad luck protection
[7:16:04] gellyy: gavel enjoyers YEP
[7:16:30] amohell: With M+ gearing being as good as it is, are loot/raid lockouts outdated?
[7:16:30] reippailija: big dam, big dam, big dam
[7:17:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Money? monkaS
[7:18:16] xXFlow29Xx: xD
[7:18:33] TBouse: WoW needs gdkp
[7:18:37] Fortvila: raid gear feels way outdated in this m+ wow
[7:18:37] ren0m: Is gearing now really that bad? Or is that just people wanting everything to be easier?
[7:18:46] wakeandbacon95: did devs talk about dinar?
[7:18:59] xXFlow29Xx: like a guildmate who loot belorelos with reroll and never play him and i'm always looking for it
[7:19:16] theskot: some trinkets actually change your gameplay, those are a huge deal
[7:19:35] Zircons: yeah nobody gives a shit about anything but weapons/trinkets because everything else is so fucking generic
[7:19:44] theskot: thats true
[7:19:53] theskot: no other slot has anything exciting even embellishments are kinda zzz
[7:19:57] ren0m: But some degree of griding and RNG is fine imo. If we make everything super easy, it's a problem.
[7:20:12] TheFellowOne: Fyrakk trinkets?
[7:20:31] ren0m: Or they can make trinkets/weapons not as super important.

[7:21:43] TBouse: incredibly toxic pug system lol
[7:22:09] Zircons: Yeah, the math on group loot vs personal is supposed to even out, but in practice it's just people trying to roll to sell
[7:22:38] ren0m: So, just add personal loot everywhere.
[7:22:49] Zircons: well people complained about that too
[7:23:05] monntuu: jb who do i get ahold for some DHT tech
[7:23:24] monntuu: i mean share it

[7:23:31] StreamElements: https://controlc.com/4576b230 󠀀
[7:23:56] Fortvila: dinars should be a permanent thing, each boss drop one token and let u buy an item every other week
[7:24:35] TheFellowOne: The icon needs to be on at least one healer due to how it works
[7:24:37] Pinslate: icon and pips both from vault never even an idea id get it from raid
[7:24:51] TheFellowOne: *for raid ofc
[7:25:24] monntuu: i found a lock gate through the first wall, the one you can pull adds through
[7:25:26] WingedChipmunk: Got heroic icon off first vault
[7:25:39] WingedChipmunk: got all 3 very rare items off the first 4 vaults
[7:25:41] monntuu: and also a spot for dragon boss where you dont spawn in dragons
[7:25:54] ren0m: Or add role-specific items.
[7:26:49] monntuu: during push back
[7:27:23] monntuu: yeah it does to the right of the too
[7:27:52] monntuu: there^
[7:28:08] monntuu: Thanks man

[7:31:03] Stormy_o: you should be allowed to ban bosses from your vault
[7:31:40] ren0m: As a priest, do you need to be holy/disc to get a staff?
[7:31:43] ren0m: From Vault
[7:31:55] Zircons: seasonal content
[7:32:20] amohell: In Legion you needed way more loot though, as you still had gear swapping in M+?
[7:32:26] Javi11844: @ren0m No
[7:32:52] ren0m: Well I got a mace, dagger and off-hand when opening it as shadow :/
[7:32:52] Javi11844: But they all suffer the same chance to get a dagger or OH
[7:33:13] Javi11844: Just bad luck unfortunately
[7:33:25] ren0m: I thought I fucked up
[7:33:45] theskot: and your raid isnt going to funnel you loot that only helps m+ and not raid, which makes sense
[7:33:47] Javi11844: The only thing that separates holy/disc from shadow is trinkets
[7:33:58] Javi11844: For vault

[7:34:51] WingedChipmunk: During Aburrus, I main healed. Had an Dev evoker that would heal in M+ try taking rashoks from me for that very reason (I also did keys)
[7:34:55] Zircons: bring back titanforging
[7:35:07] amohell: Are we nostalgic for titanforging now? pepeLaugh
[7:35:46] Harleybane: game is literally a queue simulator at this point in season
[7:37:29] boomshroom: attunements were they way
[7:38:52] Javi11844: Honestly just do personal loot and bonus rolls
[7:38:55] Harleybane: just remove drop loot in general and do everything via currency
[7:39:02] tettles: i think the gear itself is just boring af
[7:39:06] tettles: stats are incredibly boring
[7:39:16] simplepathwow: tweet uuh
[7:39:31] jmejellyfish: only reason i could think to keep group loot over personal loot is like what you kind of were saying it forces groups to KEEEP running content
[7:40:01] thegrt13: i'd just be careful since the upgrade system could get roped into "all aspects of loot"
