[0:16:35] hdott52: the ele is juno
[0:16:36] omerm98: weird part is theres probably people out there that play like these bots and thats kinda worrying
[0:16:37] IAttackYou: this is the way ion intend this to be
[0:16:40] dacuull: How they react?
[0:16:43] Ventorpoe: that tank is a team player
[0:16:47] whosyp: if u pull for him, will he try to taunt?
[0:16:51] Humantelope: what a noob
[0:16:54] Theliahh: they're birds not butterflies
[0:17:00] TotallyNotRaien: this would be a fun healing check if you pull for the tank
[0:17:02] ubba90: seems like a pug tank forgot the shield would bounce to them
[0:17:05] IAttackYou: dorki isnt even helping them
[0:17:06] Loc_et: what do the bots do if you run and pull the whole room @dorki

[0:17:41] oevrit: avg pug dps doing nada and ninja pulling
[0:17:42] kitty0chi: i doubt these are AI controlled characters. seems like scripting to me
[0:17:48] IAttackYou: dorki just want to see his teammates die
[0:17:52] alison_hell: can you just slash follow tank and go afk?
[0:17:52] dooominiic_: @chat when does s4 start s3 end?
[0:17:53] kayed3: does the tank stream ? xdd
[0:17:55] Hred5: @kitty0chi ikr. everything called AI these days
[0:18:05] Aemon__: healer is already outperforming growl
[0:18:07] SL_Nerf_Herder: Bullying robots ... MrDestructoid the ai will remember this
[0:18:08] LifeofSlayer77: @dooominiic_ xddShrug
[0:18:08] kitty0chi: @Hred5 zero standards
[0:18:09] Morayeden: Have to limit test them
[0:18:16] Nil_13: yes this is scripting not AI
[0:18:20] Ckraigfriend: dorki why are most vdh tanks running bigger crit gem and small haste?
[0:18:21] miraagex: it may look stupid for us, but i love how it might help new players feel better and not feel anxious about the dungeons
[0:18:27] Hred5: this is scripting and bad one at that. mage just spams fireball lol
[0:18:29] ubba90: that healer doing so much work
[0:18:31] EpixsTheGamer: leave the key and the bots report you for griefing
[0:18:35] Hred5: they could have least put a rotation for the chars??
[0:18:35] Im_anDe: @dorki if you /dance they dance with you apparently
[0:18:39] dooominiic_: @LifeofSlayer77 That was a serious question :D im not uptodate
[0:18:41] Niroggo: xdd

[0:18:46] Hopefulx: TEMPO LUST
[0:18:47] Hred5: do /dance @dorki
[0:18:48] Hopefulx: CODED THAT ONE SPECIFICLY
[0:18:48] yumytv: it just walks around and stands in every swirly
[0:18:49] Minigamer911: It's still more fast paced
[0:18:49] Humantelope: its to help burn the lashers. sick lust
[0:18:51] TotallyNotRaien: ff14 bots are competent
[0:18:51] Faraday5001: thats a peat lust
[0:18:52] thendj: hes watching timer duh
[0:18:53] Pyrrha_GG: typical shamans
[0:18:53] lockjaw570: @yumytv remember dorki said it was all your fault
[0:18:59] KuramiKyuubi: why he runs m0?^^
[0:18:59] buzzkill00: yoo dorkster
[0:19:01] HolyHotcakesBruh: ff14 bots are better, from what I'm seeing here
[0:19:03] yaellian: FF14 bots are actually better
[0:19:03] shikatsu_: one pack at a time
[0:19:07] XLchance_: the bot followers you get in ff 11 are unironically smarter than this and 14 tbh
[0:19:07] PsychoxDH: this is better for sure
[0:19:08] martinyte_: new content lol?
[0:19:09] Wordsw0rth: @yumytv it's trained on classic data Kappa
[0:19:10] lowincomehooker: just as dumb
[0:19:12] jonpelf: at least they didnt lust a single pack
[0:19:14] spookydh: @KuramiKyuubi testing new feature, npc team
[0:19:15] Cakerinotv: ff14 bots are better
[0:19:22] gwildorr_: how do we fix elvui??
[0:19:22] KuramiKyuubi: ahhh i see thx ^^
[0:19:27] sakpartyof1: no meters in the companion dungeons? F this
[0:19:28] seblie: npc dh have 4k io
[0:19:28] kitty0chi: better than this - they don't use a single spell all the time. apart from that meh, kinda same
[0:19:32] IAttackYou: healer movement
[0:19:33] tykus21: he can heal the damage
[0:19:35] PsychoxDH: the ffxiv follower dungeons take forever
[0:19:41] martinyte_: why we doing academy=?
[0:19:43] reppap: classic healer movement
[0:19:43] Fiz89: this has to be one of the more useless things blizzard have ever made in the game...  Doubt this would be used for anything but testing UI/WA's in combat
[0:19:43] jancelordan: FF14 bots dodge all mechanics
[0:19:44] ubba90: tank seems to be the best of the AI so far. healer maybe needs work
[0:19:45] Floofyshork: Looks similar, FF guys for the longest time wouldnt do any aoe so it takes forever, but they are really good at mechanics :D
[0:19:50] Phixxit: About eh same it seems, everything is way more scripted so they know exactly where to move for bosses
[0:19:54] Feverdreams_0_: hey dorki, hey chat dorkiHey
[0:19:55] tankttank: this is why new players quit the game!!
[0:19:57] Minigamer911: oddoneBakana
[0:20:02] TotallyNotRaien: i wonder how much dev time this feature took up
[0:20:09] IAttackYou: does the flag keep u alive
[0:20:10] mk__9: average healer pov
[0:20:11] XLchance_: they should rage at you when you overlap cc to simulate a real group
[0:20:11] IAttackYou: there is no way
[0:20:25] KaladinHS: it was probably a lot
[0:20:26] Minigamer911: Not much considering the system has been in place since at least Exil'es reach came out
[0:20:28] yaellian: We lost a raid tier for this shit Sadge Kappa
[0:20:30] theburgerking8: costs us S4 raid
[0:20:31] HolyHotcakesBruh: i mean this is a good feature
[0:20:32] tankttank: @dorki does the tank lose aggro?
[0:20:33] kayed3: @dorki can you follow the tank and they will do the dung by them self's ?
[0:20:35] K4lsdern: why is the healer just running around on their mount xdd
[0:20:39] omerm98: even if it was juist 1 dev who did this still looks like a giant waste of time
[0:20:40] Humantelope: they had some half baked bots from the islands. I'm sure it wasn't too much of a stretch to slap these together
[0:20:40] seblie: imagine they kick u, toxic report
[0:20:43] seamuscg: LUL
[0:20:44] d0mezg4mer: can I chose who my bots are? I want to play with warcraft legends like thrall, anduin, and dumbledore
[0:20:45] mk__9: is that juno
[0:20:47] Zaleratv: this is prob why no raid tier
[0:20:50] Ckraigfriend: DORKI ELYSIAN DECREE LOOKS SO OP NOW
[0:20:58] Theliahh: the people making this feature are not making raid tiers
[0:20:59] truthlol: is that mage imfiredup ?
[0:21:00] pleezenthnku: trial run for delve tech
[0:21:01] ubba90: it would be nice to being able to farm m0 mounts or something
[0:21:03] Minigamer911: AI MDI POGGERS
[0:21:04] Ckraigfriend: its green
[0:21:06] thendj: i just want to know how they took the people from my keys and put them in these
[0:21:07] yaboimiles1: Can finally phase out healer players
[0:21:07] Hred5: @dorki they can do AI M+ whenever they want. it's not like it's hard
[0:21:10] qtceef: they made it fel insted

[0:21:33] wegslol: can i just make it 2 augs as my teammates in these ai dungeons
[0:21:33] KaladinHS: they just need to feed dorki's tank data into the AI model
[0:21:33] Theliahh: does elysian decree still do arcane damage
[0:21:34] Hred5: dance with them dorki 󠀀

[0:23:01] discomancer1: keep in mind that this feature is really not meant for us. it's meant for the civilians who never play m+ because they don't like going fast

[2:00:12] Itsmefaxxie: Most people lust p1
[2:00:28] morefishHD: you can easily kill him before p3
[2:00:32] DOR0S: u can kill him p2 because its timed
[2:00:33] Itsmefaxxie: ^
[2:00:34] gankeds: most people lust after second set of big adds in p2
[2:00:47] omerm98: any niche things that seperate levels of tanks? im struggling a lot in 26's but 24/25 seem to be okay and im not doing anything different
[2:00:47] injos: Use BL after 2nd set of adds in p2. Then you can kill him before he turns dragon
[2:00:50] DOR0S: lust p1 is useless but p2 its fine
[2:00:56] Garzag_: i just had 2 monk healers disconnect in a row in m+ is there some shit bugging them out??
[2:01:02] voldeekay: p2 not p1 lust :D
[2:01:18] voldeekay: he phases at 70%
[2:01:50] gwildorr_: @omerm98 each key level is 10% more dmg done and taken.. so 24/25s people might be living those hits.. but 26 means they are one shot dead.  Groups have to be better at kicks, no missing important stuff etc
[2:02:11] toastbam: yo dorki
[2:02:36] yeyanow: poggies
[2:02:36] Cakerinotv: @Garzag_ ive been having some issues
[2:02:48] glutton420: how much is the % increase per key? is it the same or?
[2:03:10] TwicksTV: 8%
[2:03:21] saevenar: That's only four DKs lul
[2:03:37] Lycanus4: meow
[2:03:43] Myusen: @TwicksTV wasnt that last season
[2:03:45] zeph_6: holy milk
[2:03:48] hdott52: yeah i think its 8% per key but multiplicative
[2:04:31] Crimzoned: love the new faeline stomp
[2:04:39] omerm98: it fees like the change is more then 8% from a 25>26, like im going from feeling comfortable to packing every second, do i need to change rotation or do i just need comms in a group
[2:04:55] mikethedh: how is your elvui working?
[2:05:05] theburgerking8: it's 10%, last season started out as 10 then they reduced to 8% beyond level 20 at end to make up for early aug keys being overpowered
[2:05:16] hdott52: you think your followers from dungeons kill this boss?
[2:05:33] pk99: followers barely kill normal dungeon trash
[2:05:48] Myloozy: Fyrakk already? How impactful are the tindy nerfs chat

[3:57:04] Tarisant: rogue mage warlock baby we're ba k
[3:57:05] Tarisant: back
[3:57:16] warlord1515: imagine blood dk
[3:57:18] Emm_Zee: HOLY nerf was right
[3:57:24] Snizzlenose: what do you prefer, disc or mw?
[3:57:25] KaladinHS: why would you go rogue, mage, warlock over a dh
[3:57:25] Theliahh: there's no way we're on day 4 of talking about this
[3:57:30] Morayeden: When the world needed him the most, he vanished
[3:57:31] freehawk1: what did he say
[3:57:32] Cakerinotv: still no dungeon nerfs
[3:57:32] ZhranVL: Did u get elle to be your main healer yet
[3:57:35] garyhn: goodo thing you ara talking about 1% of players problem
[3:57:36] warlord1515: imagine if blood dk could control ads
[3:57:41] Tarisant: NonVerbal
[3:57:43] Mactub: wait i missed it what did he say
[3:57:43] hdott52: did you hear what nerfs bro said when they got back together?
[3:57:45] Tarisant: #stayverbal

[3:58:19] Aladdyn88: i dont need fine bro i need strong as fuk !:D
[3:58:21] freehawk1: I feel like in BFA it was worse no?
[3:58:30] zachl_: healers have to heal like thricefold healthbars in some mechs
[3:58:30] heloraeon: this feels like blizzard is making the same mistake as they did with raid, WA taking over the dungeon mechanics so they make harder and harder mechanics and it just spirals out of their control.
[3:58:31] BruhItsKoda1: no shot
[3:58:32] Vardred32: we all just need a gingi in our lives. cause we ant be him. skill issue
[3:58:33] KoveedTN: Also I don’t think anyone should complain and ask for dungeon nerfs because max ilvl loot is from +20 and they are not that bad for most of players I would say. if someone is complaining because they can’t complete a +34 I think there is no reason because nobody told you to do that.
[3:58:34] Morayeden: Def not
[3:58:36] warlord1515: @fizzis_ yeah and only two tanks can really deal with this garbage
[3:58:42] mk__9: just look at freehold chat
[3:58:43] K4lsdern: xdd
[3:58:46] Ferore: pugging 25s and 26s i see it all the till, ill have silence sigil on a pack and someone will use an aoe stop at the same time for no reason
[3:58:47] mk__9: barely any interrupt rotation
[3:58:52] freehawk1: oh yeah 2 outlaw and a WW
[3:58:53] itsbamaaaa: would u rather shot calling as a tank? or have a dps do it?
[3:58:55] mk__9: we had that shit last season

[3:58:59] Cmde: do u think next season dh utility wil become useless? as i feel its what makes it so good this season
[3:59:08] Tarisant: @zachl_ u like shadowlands dungeons stop speaking
[3:59:09] whiskeyhide: SQUIRRELS
[3:59:12] Cakerinotv: I'm not typing mid key holy
[3:59:14] KoveedTN: Also I don’t think anyone should complain and ask for dungeon nerfs because max ilvl loot is from +20 and they are not that bad for most of players I would say. if someone is complaining because they can’t complete a +34 I think there is no reason because nobody told you to do that.
[3:59:18] Morayeden: @zachl_  MODS
[3:59:19] heloraeon: @Tarisant sanguine depths was a good dungeon man
[3:59:29] zachl_: @Tarisant i love los'ing juggernauts and afking for 1 minute to line juggernauts
[3:59:31] zachl_: cool dungeon
[3:59:38] Tarisant: necrotic wake plaguefall spires poggers
[3:59:39] kaysiix: war had aoe stop
[3:59:44] Tarisant: it didnt work like that in bfa @zachl_ dweeb
[3:59:45] Cruzerthebruzer: @Tarisant AD is so shit
[3:59:46] LazyL1on: outlaw had mass stun
[3:59:54] KoveedTN: Also I don’t think anyone should complain and ask for dungeon nerfs because max ilvl loot is from +20 and they are not that bad for most of players I would say. if someone is complaining because they can’t complete a +34 I think there is no reason because nobody told you to do that.
[3:59:57] driiiinky: Sup broooo
[3:59:59] Tarisant: actually none of the bfa dungeons they've brought back work even close to how they did in bfa
[4:00:02] Sinsea: Frost mage has 3 separate novas lmao
[4:00:02] zachl_: id bang out a nice chill spires over this dogshit dungeon rotation
[4:00:02] kaysiix: and ppl were busted as well , like full versa shit
[4:00:04] zachl_: MAJORW
[4:00:04] driiiinky: I have DHT 27
[4:00:05] Rylddd: @KoveedTN lazy bait
[4:00:06] Emm_Zee: @LazyL1on No it didn't, but it did stun things rotationally xdd
[4:00:07] Tarisant: they're all bad on rework (more shocking news at 8)
[4:00:20] whiskeyhide: bfa dungeons got big old bandaids with the obelisks
[4:00:40] Cakerinotv: 4
[4:00:47] Vardred32: "chill spires" xdd
[4:01:04] Emm_Zee: Not only is it 10 stops but half of them are like 25s cooldowns also
[4:01:10] Ferore: legion when everyone was belf tho
[4:01:23] KaladinHS: Why is balance druid in all the top keys
[4:01:23] vivenna_: it's kinda funny that something like that happened with me before. I went nonverbal cause i was furious and the rogue in my team gave me like an 1 hour lecture after that lol
[4:01:25] fizzis_: frustrating if yorue playing a bdk too
[4:01:25] bareuheldig: having to call as a tank is a warcrime
[4:01:26] Nox1o: non-verbal angle
[4:01:31] Tarisant: @KaladinHS mark of the wild baby
[4:01:40] mk__9: NonVerbal
[4:01:44] zachl_: cause ur not gonna bring a spriest for fort
[4:01:45] zachl_: so
[4:01:47] BruhItsKoda1: on top of living while tanking half of a dungeon at a time
[4:01:49] zachl_: bring boomkin for mark
[4:01:58] Aladdyn88: boomkin shit
[4:01:58] freehawk1: Okay but with the new talent trees, what is the solution? How do you design dungeons now? Just make mobs do less again? We have way more utility in DF
[4:02:01] KoveedTN: I don’t think anyone should complain and ask for dungeon nerfs because max ilvl loot is from +20 and they are not that bad for most of players I would say. if someone is complaining because they can’t complete a +34 I think there is no reason because nobody told you to do that. what do you think?

[4:03:58] KoveedTN: Also I don’t think anyone should complain and ask for dungeon nerfs because max ilvl loot is from +20 and they are not that bad for most of players I would say. if someone is complaining because they can’t complete a +34 I think there is no reason because nobody told you to do that.

[4:04:16] heloraeon: so what you're saying is you want, less mechanics, bigger pulls with tighter timers?
[4:04:19] 프래그먼츠: Also I don’t think anyone should complain and ask for dungeon nerfs because max ilvl loot is from +20 and they are not that bad for most of players I would say. if someone is complaining because they can’t complete a +34 I think there is no reason because nobody told you to do that.

[4:04:43] K4lsdern: L take bozo

[4:05:02] GodsFaithInHumanity2: trueee. give +34 better rewards Madge
[4:05:02] mk__9: W take
[4:05:07] Pechorin333: I complain when I'm not allowed to interact with an affix because of the class I play
[4:05:08] Theliahh: make the timer lower above 20 instead of buffing all the mob damage
[4:05:33] zachl_: how do u even reduce button bloat with how unique some spells are
[4:05:34] kaysiix: so back to MOP where they turn specs into 6 buttons ?
[4:05:41] zachl_: some spells are too unique to remove
[4:05:49] Nox1o: imagine getting oneshot as a class in high keys. No one told you to play that class in high keys, so stop complaining
[4:05:51] bareuheldig: youre cancelled dorki
[4:05:52] Thyrox4ever: noo dont take away my buttons
[4:05:53] BallenitaSploosh: when non verbal was not mainstream FeelsStrongMan
[4:05:55] Cakerinotv: reduce rotations, keep utility
[4:05:55] imjebb: everyones got a nonverbal story
[4:05:58] freehawk1: @zachl_ why not
[4:06:01] hdott52: what do you think was the joker moment for JR to go non verbal?
[4:06:05] mk__9: become nonverbal 变得非语言 tiger paw incident 虎掌事件 ambition dissolves 野心解散
[4:06:07] K4lsdern: NonVerbal
[4:06:19] sky1___: become nonverbal 变得非语言 tiger paw incident 虎掌事件 ambition dissolves 野心解散
[4:06:28] zachl_: @freehawk1 because every button has a moment where its good at least in the classes i play
[4:06:30] itsdatwoowoo: @dorki this all stemmed from talent trees and the ability to customize your toons for utility. I don’t think we were rather it be simple again.
[4:06:33] Cakerinotv: not mw having like 48 buttons rn
[4:06:34] Camelbak21: @zachl_ You can make alternative choice node passives that are better in the same spot in the tree EZchamp
[4:06:35] zachl_: like how would u even reduce buttons
[4:06:35] explic_cit: he was nonverbal when churchman jack did not PI fat chicken yesterday
[4:06:37] HansHaunts: but JR is the og nonverbal
[4:06:37] shmeat: fat chicken keys?
[4:06:45] 7negative: and now we know and love your voice
[4:06:48] freehawk1: @zachl_ it worked before

[4:07:34] Theliahh: they did button bloat removal in like legion right ?
[4:07:43] freehawk1: @zachl_ you're not making any sense
[4:08:08] zachl_: u cant remove buttons without removing spells that are core parts of why a spec can be good
[4:08:11] zachl_: keep buttons big
[4:08:26] Theliahh: you gotta take away buttons at some point
[4:08:37] NDRandell: Just delete mage 4Head
[4:08:59] freehawk1: But how do you justify the new talent trees then?
[4:09:00] ingo_jj: loved the button bloat Shadow Priest in S1 but everyone complained.
[4:09:03] sky1___: Fat chicken gameplay?
[4:09:03] chrono_za: Nerdge
[4:09:06] zachl_: okok what spells do u think need pruning
[4:09:08] zachl_: examples
[4:09:14] KoveedTN: your voice sounds so cool but we need a face to associate to the voice
[4:09:14] OlaF_oo: dorki do you want to rank the dragonflight dungeons?
[4:09:14] smuggamer1337: NOTED
[4:09:14] freehawk1: mass barrier
[4:09:18] chrono_za: NOTED
[4:09:18] nrgiee: wait is there new class tuning?
[4:09:20] Aylena_Evouline: Slice and dice needs to go
[4:09:20] m_dep: I wish I didnt need mouse buttons bound
[4:09:23] m_dep: mmo mice are just not as good
[4:09:24] fizzis_: yeah but league is garbage now. EVERY new champ needs atleast 2 cc/fears now
[4:09:33] imjebb: make healers real again <3
[4:09:35] freehawk1: But this would just make classes samey again
[4:09:41] zachl_: i can see that
[4:09:42] LordAnomandaris: So every spec before a shaman PepeLaugh
[4:09:45] chrono_za: mhm
[4:09:59] Ale2104: AND PRAY
[4:10:04] NDRandell: I think we need to prune mages from the game, thst would solve a lot of problems
[4:10:06] kevo3times: finally some boomie blasting
[4:10:06] kaysiix: so make every spec a war ? no cd def , full zug zug no CC no aoe control
[4:10:14] KoveedTN: which meele dps has best defensives?
[4:10:15] mk__9: but healer said the game was dogshit when they had to heal bosses last couple of seasons xdd
[4:10:17] leofdz: 31 haste and 31 mastery is good?
[4:10:20] whatisthistwitchlol: Sub rogues have way too many buttons
[4:10:24] garyhn: dorki you just want target dommis in M+
[4:10:28] Emm_Zee: Imagine being an enhance shaman, getting a super cool tier set, blasting damage, insane funnel but being dog useless because you only have 1 wall Aware
[4:10:31] Ale2104: I just rotate trhough my Astral Shift. KEKW
[4:10:34] zachl_: i was gonna say removing stops in this meta would literally be so fucking brutal
[4:10:37] zachl_: but i see what ur sayin
[4:10:40] staziko: when blizzard will do something to enhance eeee
[4:10:43] nrgiee: where can I find the new class tuning
[4:10:48] garyhn: SO BOURING DUDE
[4:10:56] Camelbak21: People wants to pull big and do big damn, like chat pls, hello
[4:10:58] BruhItsKoda1: if you dont remove some stops, you have to keep making dungeons that require a bunch or they become trivial
[4:11:03] chrono_za: bad take donki
[4:11:04] siokeee: then where is the difficult?
[4:11:08] KoveedTN: which meele dps has best defensives?
[4:11:11] zNzUV: OHH Kappa Kappa Kappa
[4:11:11] XaelXXI: have the option to do the dungeon on harder difficulties. M+ and M++
[4:11:12] warlord1515: not like the big dragons in rise
[4:11:18] garyhn: obviusly i dont push 28
[4:11:19] mk__9: dorki wants every dungeon to be freehold RAGEY
[4:11:21] dknamey: and remove on dead affix from shitty little mobs like flowers
[4:11:22] Theliahh: delete the stops so they stop designing dungeons around stops
[4:11:24] fizzis_: @siokeee the key scaling infinitely is the difficulty
[4:11:24] GodsFaithInHumanity2: trueee
[4:11:27] siokeee: yeah but you got to this point soon
[4:11:28] garyhn: but i think iom good 3k io?
[4:11:29] siokeee: and then?
[4:11:31] iSamuraiQ8: what if a dh player
[4:11:31] papach0ng: Being able to funnel on bosses is hella fun
[4:11:31] LifeofSlayer77: true
[4:11:31] staziko: lol my class cant be played its not meta kekw
[4:11:34] kaysiix: aren't already waht ppl do ? i mean ppl at the top
[4:11:37] chrono_za: u dont like coordination?
[4:11:40] chrono_za: LUL
[4:11:42] Vardred32: @dorki you compete in the upcoming mdi?
[4:11:55] KoveedTN: Would like M+ to have only Forti and Tyran as affixes?
[4:11:55] kaysiix: they optimized every shit  , made every wa , every little sim stuff
[4:11:56] GodsFaithInHumanity2: i minmax in raid where its giga easy :)
[4:11:56] Theliahh: @iSamuraiQ8 ?
[4:11:58] Mrjakoby2001: no need for a gazillion different mechanics and stops in a infinitely scaling gamemode
[4:12:06] Higgoms: Good rotation, dodging mechanics, good positioning. Lots of things can be interesting and hard without having to stack stops/specific classes
[4:12:09] deadxtube: like final fantasy ?
[4:12:10] staziko: lol my class cant be played its not meta kekw let blittard fix that first then we can play the game
[4:12:14] garyhn: more fun for who? for you?
[4:12:20] just_ok_viewer: wasn't that like shadowlands?
[4:12:20] zachl_: @garyhn for everyone.
[4:12:26] Ale2104: I just wanna chill and doing big damage. Thats all
[4:12:32] freddusya: speaking of MDI, do u know when is the MDI? usually we at least get 1 in .5 patch .. or maybe it TGP?
[4:12:33] TheFreckMan: so you want everything to be sludgefist
[4:12:35] Emm_Zee: Having one guy be required to do beans rotation because he has to look at kick and stop timers nonstop sucks so much ngl
[4:12:41] garyhn: @zachl_ naaa
[4:12:42] zachl_: everyone is responsible for so much shit nowadays. let us fucking sit there and blast
[4:12:50] chrono_za: me :)
[4:12:52] zachl_: no one wants to juggle 5 mechanics and kick and do damage
[4:12:54] zachl_: like
[4:12:54] Erueruu: absolutely no one
[4:12:55] moistweaverr: me :)
[4:12:55] staziko: always skipping..... how to get a  big dmg my friend when your class is capped ? ;)
[4:12:56] papach0ng: @freddusya it's a back and forth, we had tgp last tier, and mdi this tier
[4:12:56] Morayeden: Most people aren't even encountering what Dorki is talking about.
[4:12:58] smuggamer1337: me
[4:12:59] BruhItsKoda1: bro aint no way people enjoy pressing 7 non damage buttons in a row KEKW
[4:13:02] hdott52: limit max
[4:13:03] zachl_: @Morayeden SO TRUE
[4:13:03] KoveedTN: Would like M+ to have only Forti and Tyran as affixes?
[4:13:05] Emm_Zee: I enjoy it only because it is free io xdd
[4:13:05] Camelbak21: I just wanna pump do dmg
[4:13:08] LordAnomandaris: Sounds like NA needs to get gud
[4:13:10] Blackiichan_: Greg?
[4:13:13] Erueruu: had to use 200% of the brain to play high keys
[4:13:16] Nedidark: I went from wanting to tank and shotcall for my groups to just turning my brain off after all the shit that's needed now
[4:13:17] garyhn: again talking about a 1% players problem
[4:13:20] zachl_: @KoveedTN i think its more about dungeon design
[4:13:22] siokeee: i like when my group have to communicate and coordinate to success in the key, no matter what the details says bro
[4:13:27] primemnster: shotcalling in m+ is so stressful ong
[4:13:28] staziko: how to get and do a good dmg when your class is capped ?????
[4:13:29] ItsYent: but then u do classic raids/dungeons and you are bored out of your mind
[4:13:30] Raerdk: equinox?
[4:13:30] zachl_: @garyhn yes then this doesnt apply to u
[4:13:32] sky1___: Non verbal gameplay
[4:13:33] m_dep: why not shotcall as dps?
[4:13:34] Theliahh: where did newsh go he needs to listen
[4:13:35] Ferore: i honestly cant see illuminated sigils making it into the next expansion, its one of the strongest talents in the game for m+ and makes other tanks flat out worse by existing
[4:13:40] spaghettinooble: do tanks normally do all shotcalling in keys?
[4:13:45] papach0ng: thats what the aoe stop wa is for
[4:13:46] rciffer: also you need like 3 people to do shot calling in highest keys now
[4:13:49] bareuheldig: @spaghettinooble only on na
[4:13:50] Beyondbladez: it just  feels ass as a brew in 25-26 when i know a dh can aoe  cc the pull for 15-20 seconds and i have sweep
[4:13:53] Cmde: honestly id like almost everything to be like doti, a kick u need to enter the mob area first to kick, a move u have to move out of buble, a mob that fires a ball u have to dodge and position well to dmg mobs, pizza boss with some kind of tank mechanic added
[4:13:54] spaghettinooble: I haven't watched much m+ until this season
[4:14:01] KoveedTN: I would love M+ to have only Forti and Tyran and no other crap
[4:14:10] avispa13: but but my frostbolt spam???
[4:14:11] Ale2104: You have MANA in classic. WTF
[4:14:11] zachl_: @rciffer ur tank and healer at minimum need to be talking for sure and even evoker
[4:14:16] zachl_: @rciffer its so hard
[4:14:16] papach0ng: @KoveedTN would be so bland though
[4:14:19] siokeee: @papach0ng a weak aura does this?
[4:14:20] oevrit: @KoveedTN  BASED
[4:14:22] Cakerinotv: Healing in classic is only about mana conservation
[4:14:24] Erueruu: @KoveedTN it would be so boring. at least get seasonal affix
[4:14:37] Morayeden: It's expected
[4:14:40] chrono_za: non verbal
[4:14:40] papach0ng: @siokeee yea, there is one on wago, aoe stops or something like that
[4:14:44] Razdruid: nobody
[4:14:44] m_dep: why not just do a 6th man for shotcalling like RWF
[4:14:45] Vardred32: tank
[4:14:45] Hipiti: tank
[4:14:46] avispa13: NonVerbal
[4:14:47] Razdruid: lmao
[4:14:49] whoknowsdude_: non verbal
[4:14:49] xKenver: in my teams nobody does, we just yolo it and deplete
[4:14:50] staziko: well u cant play the game when ur class is capped and only buffing mages my friend
[4:14:50] fizzis_: no one cuz i jsut pug
[4:14:50] LifeofSlayer77: no one its all pugs xdd
[4:14:51] siokeee: @papach0ng crazy
[4:14:51] Blackiichan_: i do, and i hate it
[4:14:52] rciffer: tanks for kick/stops, healer for defensives
[4:14:52] johnnasbrother: tank calls cc healer calls defensives
[4:14:52] BallenitaSploosh: i go full non verbal on keys and yolo the ccs
[4:14:53] dknamey: you should start flying in the old world instead of valdrakken
[4:14:53] clouud1234: rangedps
[4:14:54] toastbam: no one
[4:14:54] oevrit: NonVerbal
[4:14:54] Morayeden: When i play with my buds I have to call
[4:14:54] seriousalsa: pro dps dont know half the mechanics
[4:14:57] seriousalsa: bro
[4:14:58] Camelbak21: Nobody wants to do it
[4:15:00] sky1___: non verbal
[4:15:02] ottomr1990: i try to as tank but i definitely can't stay on top of it
[4:15:05] Cakerinotv: I play with a group. Usually a mix of both but mostly tank
[4:15:07] shmeat: the bm hunter calls
[4:15:09] K4lsdern: our boomie and tank mostly
[4:15:10] Spirit_GamingTV: Whoever feels like talking at the moment
[4:15:11] KoveedTN: I always Pug so I always tell myself what to do!🤣🤣🤣🤣
[4:15:14] Ferore: im puggnig 26s so usually theres no comms, its more "keep this interrupts and ill keep this interrupted" but no coordination
[4:15:15] Emm_Zee: Nobody wants to do differential equations to figure out if their VDH can stop the next casts or not ICANT
[4:15:24] Erueruu: gingi and drjay are built different
[4:15:30] Depleters: we don't call anything
[4:15:30] papach0ng: ranged generally has the least amount of mechanics to do
[4:15:32] Cocotao: Do you do it as boomkin ?
[4:15:46] chrono_za: mhm
[4:15:55] TheFreckMan: what if M+ affixes were just like x2 mana usage on healers and some mobs have a tank buster it would be better than most affixes right now
[4:16:00] Morayeden: Why is there such a HUGE gap between the tanks kits?!
[4:16:03] Morayeden: It sucks
[4:16:05] Cakerinotv: We just call out who's gonna kick next
[4:16:06] kaysiix: blood dk LUL
[4:16:13] zachl_: @Morayeden its the dungeons not the balance imo
[4:16:16] Ale2104: Vlood DK sucks
[4:16:18] Ferore: at least blood dk has grip
[4:16:19] Xyronic: bear death
[4:16:20] Xyronic: dorki 2
[4:16:21] chrono_za: Sadge dk
[4:16:24] shmeat: am i dead? *dies*
[4:16:32] poyc: have you tried playing with a warrior tank?
[4:16:33] kaysiix: I never knew i needed 2 silent sigil so much in my life
[4:16:34] KoveedTN: I always Pug so I always tell myself what to do!🤣🤣🤣🤣 . You guys do the same?
[4:16:36] Xyronic: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/925887987793952848/1196734292395565086/image.png?ex=65b8b4a9&is=65a63fa9&hm=45cb039db01b1335464515c3a3a94f5be6fa7cf61e784a2389af46e554183e52&
[4:16:45] primemnster: imagine trying to group casters in everbloom without vdh/pala/grips KEKW
[4:16:49] zachl_: dorki 2 OMEGALUL
[4:16:50] totalecl1pse_: doryki do you have an updated plater?
[4:16:53] K4lsdern: xdd
[4:16:57] Raerdk: brewmaster has 2 aoe stops that’s a lot right?
[4:17:07] Vashanka_: i'm curious what they do going forward
[4:17:08] Xyronic: codenames is the best
[4:17:12] Vashanka_: i feel like illuminated sigils can't keep existing like it does now
[4:17:15] Xyronic: bro i havent logged into wow for a month
[4:17:16] heloraeon: my concern is they wont look at it and say yeah we need to tune down the amount of kicks, they'll just nerf veng kit.
[4:17:19] Xyronic: im feelin GOOD
[4:17:19] papach0ng: @Raerdk shaman alone has 3
[4:17:26] Bleedy2: What do you think is better, a 489 versa/mast weapon or a crafted crit/haste for VDH?
[4:17:29] fonikomprokolo: feral key pog
[4:17:32] shmeat: back to chicken YEP
[4:17:35] Ferore: nah no way illuminated stays the same. either that or the CDR is reduced from cycling them
[4:17:35] zachl_: one time in codenames i ripped a california 8
[4:17:37] zachl_: good times
[4:17:37] Cakerinotv: We mark targets too, usually one person decides which add they are gonna kick
[4:17:38] KoveedTN: I’m like “ Koveed defensive in 3.2.1. Stun in 3.2.1”
[4:17:47] KoveedTN: I shotcall myself
[4:17:47] fizzis_: @Bleedy2 ilvl is better for mainhand weapon
[4:17:50] propwash80: @dorki is the gilneas story line any good?
[4:17:50] draconisraccoonis: this is why other tanks get shit on by pugs tho, because top end players just whine about not playing with Prot pal or VDH. its a pug problem for sure, but top players know by now they influnece a majority of pug groups
[4:17:52] kaysiix: in garbage , was nice to see u priest :)
[4:18:15] ottomr1990: what ever happened to the community council or whatever? like are there people in the high end pve community that actually get to talk to people that make development/tuning decisions?
[4:18:22] siokeee: agreed with that, seems like the dungeons they give us is the dungeons that fix perfect for they class tunning they doing
[4:18:24] Razdruid: bro spriest at one point in the PTR was doing less damage than disc priest. they nerfed them harder than any other class in the history of wow prob other than hpal
[4:18:26] Bleedy2: @fizzis_ ty
[4:18:27] zachl_: yes
[4:18:28] 프래그먼츠: YEP
[4:18:29] synthetica1: !ui
[4:18:29] Nightbot: https://linktr.ee/dorkibear grab my UI here or check discord for info/updates! It consists of plater/details/ElvUI/weakauras. Abilities in the middle are ElvUI action bars. CC/CD/interrupt tracker is OmniCD addon. M+ Timer is WarpDeplete addon.
[4:18:30] fizzis_: @draconisraccoonis its not a pug problem. those tanks have an insane amount of control
[4:18:30] chrono_za: YEP
[4:18:31] whiskeyhide: YEP
[4:18:31] juno_sha: No Madge
[4:18:33] moistweaverr: i refuse to bring any other tank b/c its just an int
[4:18:35] zachl_: i feel so much safer with those tanks
[4:18:35] juno_sha: only ber
[4:18:36] Theliahh: the vdh gives me a kiss on the forehead
[4:18:40] Spirit_GamingTV: Oppressing roar > 2 silence sigils = 15 second silence
[4:18:43] warlord1515: i spent 1.5 hours in queue on my blood dk doing 26s, rerolled unholy/frost and its actually insane what vdh can do compared to blood
[4:18:44] MoleDude: it might matter less in lower keys, but it feels better at all key levels
[4:18:47] Ale2104: its just easy to pay with them
[4:18:58] straighttokes420: the intrupts alone in pugs is HUGE
[4:19:08] mk__9: reddit thinks prot pal is bad
[4:19:11] zachl_: YES
[4:19:11] moistweaverr: hi healer here, give me prot pally anyday
[4:19:14] mk__9: bad experiences xdd
[4:19:15] zachl_: bingo
[4:19:15] rciffer: imagine playing bear in everblooom KEKW
[4:19:16] weezie_61: Prot pally hasnt changed tho Why now is it all of a sudden a big deal
[4:19:21] Ferore: Ive got both VDH and prot pala, and between keys its hilarious how much easier it is to get into one key over the other. like prot pala is easier to get into WCM because of BoP
[4:19:27] heloraeon: yeah try doing first hallway throne with a bear then do it with a vdh
[4:19:30] heloraeon: its night and day different
[4:19:41] chrono_za: true
[4:19:41] ottomr1990: @weezie_61 if it was't for a bear rework this would be 3 straight seasons of it being meta wdym
[4:19:41] siokeee: @Ferore on tyra is the reverse
[4:19:42] moistweaverr: @weezie_61 dungeon design requires massive amounts of stops
[4:19:48] gmacster_: bear tank best tank, clip it
[4:19:56] warlord1515: @heloraeon blood dks proc both cheats on that pull lmao
[4:19:56] fizzis_: @weezie_61 its always been good this expac?
[4:19:57] khebul: It seems like players enjoy smashing through content. E.g. playing with vdh/pala, or playing classic for that matter
[4:20:03] chrono_za: BOOBA
[4:20:11] mk__9: Looking
[4:20:13] K4lsdern: BOOBA

[4:20:33] Morayeden: He plays for the RP Sadge

[4:23:12] Mattylight24: @zachl_  baseg
[4:23:16] Ferore: imagine if they remove illuminated sigils for s4 and we're stuck with s3 set bonus
[4:23:16] KoveedTN: when are you going to give a face to your voice?
[4:23:18] chrono_za: baseg
[4:23:19] Xyronic: im going nonverbal
[4:23:21] Xyronic: wait one sec
[4:23:31] kaysiix: xdd ?
[4:23:31] lazy_pandabear: wait what was today's patch chat?
[4:23:37] viinlox: I think a trimming of mechanics in m+ would be helpful for retaining new players as well. I had a friend kind of give up cause he came in late this season. Tried to help him catch up running 18s and he got tired of dying to mechanics we knew and he didn't. I know its a one-off, but it probably happens a lot.
[4:23:42] LifeofSlayer77: xdd

[5:44:50] Nuallan94: you lose a lot of damage by dying too
[5:44:53] Aggroboy: @Cruzerthebruzer blame the wow community demanding more strict class fantasy
[5:44:59] menzlo: its ok for 1 shots or nah
[5:45:11] beanbz: dorki mage when?
[5:45:13] miraagex: Predator's Swiftness should make Regrowth not only instant cast, but also castable off GCD

[5:52:50] Archmage_Michael: Got my Aug geared up now. Should you deal with Afflicted as Aug or let the healer deal with that? I always forget it coming from DH and hunter

[5:58:36] skorchhx: did you time your follower dungeon
[5:58:43] vivenna_: @n0s0upbr0 hahahahahaha
[5:59:09] Archmage_Michael: Follower dungeon are a joke. I soloed on as havoc. bosses die in 7-8 sec
[5:59:23] skorchhx: they're normal of course they are

[6:00:12] Archmage_Michael: @gretriku I know now. but for what are they good? why do they exist?
[6:00:40] gretriku: @gretriku probably just for civilians leveling
[6:00:47] KFCswag: @gretriku new players too shy to play with pugs i guess
[6:00:48] Silencbank: for people who just wanna do a quick dungeon for stories with one friend
[6:00:50] Asburela: Why are rogues nonexistant in damage logs on this fight HUH
[6:01:01] krona: we kept looting rise and throne 31s
[6:01:08] krona: so no good 31s timed
[6:01:13] miraagex: @Archmage_Michael they are bis. WoW struggles to attract new players coz they need learn a lot + survive pressure from veterans. Being able to learn dungeons solo at their own speed is awesome
[6:01:25] krona: hes on to something, i can vouch for it
[6:02:46] krona: go on...
[6:03:00] nan_____________________: HUH
[6:03:03] gretriku: @miraagex yeah thats something FF14 has been doing and it was very well received. makes sense wow would start doing it
[6:03:20] krona: hmmMeeting does make sense...
[6:03:20] miraagex: And this followers dungeon system is like alpha/beta test for delves, as the latter will be built on top of it
[6:03:23] garyhn: BOURINGGGGGGGGGGGGG

[7:41:34] Xastin3: also immune addons
[7:41:43] ultideath: Thundering wasn't even a dmg increase. Mathnos showed after the patch that the mob health % increase at the start of the patch outweighed the thundering buff

[7:41:58] n0s0upbr0: excuse me?????
[7:41:58] vivenna_: @n0s0upbr0 not having thundering also doesnt affect bm hunter pets
