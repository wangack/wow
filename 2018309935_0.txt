[3:06:55] HotHotHeals: End of Ze World
[3:06:57] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Tides are very long waves that move across the oceans. They are caused by the gravitational forces exerted on the earth by the moon, and to a lesser extent, the sun. When the highest point in the wave, or the crest, reaches a coast, the coast experiences a high tide.
[3:07:04] Arctauran: probably king tides with big swell. get them here a bit
[3:07:16] throbbin_bowls: aquaman is near

[3:15:40] HotHotHeals: like it matters
[3:15:41] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: In higher ranks, players have been intentionally earning dishonorable kills to lower themselves below their current rank threshold in order to gain credit for an additional rank bucket, thereby allowing them to gain progress more quickly than a player who is just above that upper rank threshold.

[6:16:37] Smith6612: "All your base are belong to us" is an Internet meme based on a badly translated phrase from the opening cutscene of the Japanese video game Zero Wing. The phrase first appeared on the European release of the 1991 Sega Mega Drive port of the 1989 Japanese arcade game. By the early 2000s, a GIF animation depicting the opening text was widespread on internet forums.  It later became a widespread Internet meme. Chatting thanks to Wikipedia.

[7:36:59] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Chiros are scary go to a regular doctor
[7:37:02] Smith6612: As a kid I would also have a problem where my knees would lock up in July.
[7:37:10] PocketCrab: Comes and goes for me
[7:37:15] CallMeInfinity: HahaShrugLeft HahaShrugMiddle HahaShrugRight
[7:37:26] Smith6612: It happens if my muscles are too stiff for too long or if I'm dehydrated.
[7:37:39] asez: my wrist is like that. Cracks when ever I roll them around in circles
[7:38:03] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: But its weird cause Jake moves and stretches
[7:38:10] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Its just age
[7:38:12] Smith6612: Just have to stay comfortable and make sure the stretches are done gently (and properly)
[7:38:16] PocketCrab: Wish I could say. Its one of those irritating things where it feels like its been months when it happens, but its realistically only been a couple weeks at most
[7:38:26] asez: poster check
[7:38:40] Smith6612: I also have rocks as shoulder muscles, so I regularly need to massage them otherwise the neck gets problematic

[7:39:10] Krazyslayer: Hey Jake
[7:39:12] Smith6612: With that said. I have VERY good flexibility so, it's not that... the muscles just tend to get tense and cause problems
[7:39:14] Krazyslayer: How's WOW going
[7:39:17] PocketCrab: catJAM
[7:39:19] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: VIBE
[7:39:28] throbbin_bowls: is there pain when you move the neck ?
[7:39:30] CallMeInfinity: POG 56
[7:39:39] asez: maybe you sleeping wrong?
[7:39:55] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: I forgot to ask earlier, is it not possible to get a "work" Visa for Water?
[7:39:56] PocketCrab: Sadge
[7:40:03] Smith6612: Go for a massage, check your pillow, and try a warm bath (Jacuzzi bath or something). Those help me a lot.
[7:40:09] Ryuzak: do you sleep with just one pillow ?
[7:40:11] iamgabe69: you think its permanent
[7:40:19] Krazyslayer: Almost 5 years with Jakeypoo
[7:40:25] HotHotHeals: uh oh
[7:40:40] PocketCrab: Hopefully one day you'll be doing stuff and realize its been gone and back to normal Prayge
[7:40:46] HotHotHeals: im in thunderbluff dude my bad
[7:41:00] Smith6612: Also if you can Jake. Swimming is a great way to exercise and stretch the muscles. As well as relax them.
[7:41:04] Smith6612: Just my two cents.
[7:41:16] Stemisty: Sounds like Neck Crepitus. Try hot packs, stretches, and improve posture. I used to get it a lot when playing on my phone for extended periods of time. Mine lasted a month or so and then went away.
[7:41:20] CallMeInfinity: PepoG
[7:41:29] Ryuzak: NOTED
[7:41:46] iamgabe69: spine problems can be real scary
[7:41:46] Smith6612: In the summer I will swim for 1-2 hours in 80/82F water gently, and it will help a ton with shoulder/muscle tension.
[7:41:55] CallMeInfinity: !posutre
[7:41:58] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: My grandpas back is messed up because when my M4 got totalled a couple months ago we were parked inside the car and a dodge ram truck turned onto the street we were parked on and hit my driver side and we got fucked
[7:41:58] CallMeInfinity: !posture
[7:42:00] StreamElements: Hey you widepeepoHappy , yes you jnbW , check your posture! FeelsOkayMan
[7:42:08] HotHotHeals: staged
[7:42:19] s1nstrike: FeelsOkayMan
[7:42:38] Stemisty: Nest stretches helped me a lot. I used to hold my neck in the same spot for a long time. Once I moved around more I saw improvement
[7:43:01] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Might buy a 2018 Cayman after my case closes and I get some money from the accident.
[7:43:04] CallMeInfinity: jnbKinda I can help you stretch some more
[7:43:11] Smith6612: Don't over-stretch though
[7:43:16] Smith6612: I've hurt myself from doing that too
[7:43:26] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: This song is a classic
[7:43:40] Smith6612: Anyways. Try swimming as well. Swimming helps and it's easy on the joints
[7:43:45] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: ^
[7:43:52] iamgabe69: havent heard of jabbawockeez since like 2008
[7:43:52] PocketCrab: Need a lighter headset? but idk about that one in particular wawaShrug Also could be that IRL grind and backpack wearing but Im no expert KEK good luck Jake
[7:43:57] Smith6612: Like I said. Warm water (80-82F), 1-2 hours, just do it at night and relax.
[7:44:10] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Oh thats true that headset is pretty heavy
[7:44:17] Smith6612: It helps me a ton in the summer. Pool time, a quick shower, then I head to bed.
[7:44:18] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Its the logitech Gpro X wireless I think
[7:44:22] Stemisty: Yeah if the at home treatments don't work, PT is probably a good idea. Either way, I hope it starts to go away ^^
[7:44:26] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: But I think hes sponsored by logitech
[7:44:30] Smith6612: Shower too short
[7:44:34] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: maybe switching to Earbuds
[7:44:35] PocketCrab: monkaHmm
[7:44:54] Smith6612: But also swimming will help lift the head up naturally. Gives the muscles a break.
[7:45:04] Stemisty: Yeah I was worried about it too. Plus the sound id unpleasant. lol

[7:45:08] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: I went to about 40 PT sessions after my accident and all they did was like use those electric pulses and ice and hot stuff
[7:45:11] Stemisty: is*
[7:45:14] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Pretty useless in my opinion
[7:45:22] Stemisty: Oh wow thank you so much <3
[7:45:28] Smith6612: Electric pulse is muscle/nerve stimulation
[7:45:42] Smith6612: Heat encourages circulation

[7:47:54] The_Renegade_BC: It‚Äôs time for Atlantis to rise
[7:48:08] Stemisty: A professional massage could be worth trying as well.
[7:48:16] MisterGiggles: Be more like pee and be less like pooooooooo
[7:48:32] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: H.E massage
[7:48:33] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: lol
[7:48:37] Stemisty: oh interesting
[7:48:37] The_Renegade_BC: Nice massages in seedy Thailand places LUL LUL LUL
[7:48:45] Smith6612: Muscle relaxers are monkaW because they can also affect the heart. Gotta be super careful with that stuff
[7:48:57] The_Renegade_BC: The pop was the happy ending Jake
[7:49:17] Î¨¥Í¥ÄÌïú: Skip this song

[8:41:10] prettycarcass: @jakenbakeLIVE Did you notice more motorcycles when you were in China last? Here in Xi'an the change in a few years is insane (after they lifted the city-wide ban)

[8:44:10] lunaticss: If you run to the right coming out of WC you can just run up the hill without jumping
[8:44:19] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @gordhord7500 (warning)
[8:44:55] prettycarcass: the funny thing is, you can get your motorcycle license ONLY practicing/driving one of those three weeled bikes and then you are legally allowed to buy and drive a motorcycle
[8:45:27] prettycarcass: not to mention you can get electric ones that go 80-90kph without even having a license
