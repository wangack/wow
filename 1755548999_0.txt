[1:32:08] OnePumpWillie: @tylertheprophet what gear doesnt exist?

[3:21:50] DomonSan: @kit_cakez in that case i think one affix in addition to tyr/fort + seasonal would be enough, +2 at higher keys is just exhausting imo
[3:21:51] moderatygos: the devs have made a lot of changes to affixes since m+ first appeared int the game, they're always looking at data and taking feedback. mdi affixes don't always reflect live keys either, but give different challenges on this competitive enriovnment

[5:08:44] Bearman999: technically even lower bracket players can win the championship..losers is really a misnomer.  You don't really "lose" until you are eliminated from the series

[5:09:54] thebamfshow: haha i play rogue i just wanted to see why ppl were saying sub after i said rogue vs a specific spec
[5:10:00] jastaris: @thebamfshow sub requires a tiny bit of learning, outlaw decisions are more difficult
[5:10:03] Bearman999: Depends on your definition, if we are talking tournament wide, I think lower is a better denotation

[5:11:15] jastaris: @thebamfshow no ur wrong :) sub is not dynamic, do u even play it?
[5:11:19] casualzgamer: shadow priest was way confident wave did not go to him , had to run forward way earlier

[5:11:30] YUDI_FENIXYTB: GO BONES gingiBicep gingiBicep

[5:11:47] alodso: #gobones
[5:11:47] Bearman999: Thunderstruck is probably upset , considering they wiped on bonemaw last time they played this and the other team won..feels like  jinx

[5:12:10] Beerraa_: thank you guys! i will see what class it will be

[5:12:24] x_Scy: Desophex i highly doubt you can guarantee the slam in the other direction there
[5:12:27] Meeix: @sachassb i mean you saw how hard it ticked on the evo despite actively trying to heal it
[5:12:28] ironskull84: @Mackenzie301 they nerfed dispersion from 90 to 50% ????

[5:13:06] ModeraYsera: @AbsoIuteZeroh but we're dragons...
[5:13:07] Mackenzie301: @ironskull84 nono, I meant the frontal, it gives a 50% dmg reduction
[5:13:11] SerMonstein: @bonjourdaisy Upset the MW community as they where trolling.
[5:13:20] kit_cakez: @Meeix I believe they mean the frontal, not the dot.
[5:13:25] sachassb: @meeix i meant malevolence not the DOT, the straight up hit doesn't do too much dmg but reduces the dmg you inflict as a debuff no?
[5:13:33] x_Scy: Desophex in reality the problem was the priest not moving closer, you can be the furthest away but still be closer than he was
[5:13:35] wepunz1289: @mnowpsn dirty lol
[5:13:42] sachassb: Yeah exactly the frontal
[5:14:08] fashion_derg: what? bone buds took first map? holee

[5:43:27] lazyglue_: no in df heals are rarer than tanks
[5:43:35] Entenei: Whats the reason that teams arn't allowed to run with out a healer? are they allowed to run with out a tank or dps if they wish? is the rule just for healer?S
[5:43:59] nixuxas: good healers are more important than tanks in pugs this season
[5:44:10] UrsaM4vro: there is no rule against no healer
[5:44:17] HairClog: Healers harder to find. Been healing for years and it's lame in DF. Low dam, and tanks don't even need you. Feels pretty useless. Switched to dps and tanking
[5:44:33] savarunl: i thin kthey can do any comp they want as long as they dont class stack
[5:44:40] gamermarlo34: lets got TS
[5:44:41] Shearin77: tanks and healers both have value, just like dps
[5:44:51] lazyglue_: lol @HairClog heals has most responsibility
[5:44:59] Taylor131313: no, the rules clearly state the composition must be 1 tank/1 healer/3 dps
[5:45:01] SealTeamFish: healing is boring because blizz wants healers to do dama\ge and dps to do healing...

[5:45:47] lazyglue_: @HairClog they arent, i donno where this fake info is comming from
[5:45:48] TemNoc: @Tile102 pretty sure Zmok timed keys without a healer that were higher than 99% of what chat does LUL
[5:45:48] Entenei: @Taylor131313 Do they give a reason?
[5:45:49] nixuxas: I wiped on Hyrja so many times just because the healers can heal
[5:45:55] fraser_g: root only worked outside in classic i miss the good old days
[5:45:56] Taylor131313: Teams will feature 5 players. At any given time, a team’s composition for a dungeon must be:1 Tank1 Healer3 DPS
[5:45:57] Sinnical: you use to be only able to use it outside as well
[5:45:58] suewou: roots break concrete all the time
[5:46:01] nixuxas: *can’t
[5:46:01] czar149: my pc cant handle the ground breaking
[5:46:02] blazeefury: I think they must remove afixes for healers at least or make healing less punishing. I rly hardly fiind good healers in Df
[5:46:17] HeyitsJudas: all about turning stuff into grass
[5:46:21] UrsaM4vro: @Taylor131313 false. zmok already had his team approved to compete with no healer
[5:46:23] bebincalicious: inb4 wipe
[5:46:25] fraser_g: they should do dungeon invitational for classic wow, like if you think good idea
[5:46:27] Elkethus: @nixuxas pop personal and defensive and healing pot like a good dps and you will survive
[5:46:44] ariastrasza: Rooted birds look like bad CGI... Yes I know this is a video game lol, my point stands
[5:46:45] savarunl: hmm i guess it does make sense they enforce a 'normal' comp, otherwise every pug johnny is gonna run without a healer 'cuz i saw that in mdi'

[5:47:02] Immortal1266: Mass root and ursols is a choice node
[5:47:06] Tile102: @TemNoc pretty sure most people dont play like this teams and do usual routes with usual groups, this is a competition
[5:47:12] lazyglue_: hyrja is so easy since she does the lightning aoe only 2 times...  one time everybody deff cd 2nd time healers pops 1-2 big cd's

[5:47:22] Entenei: I think it matters now how good healers are atm, if they can do ok healing they will do near enough as good as a top teir healer, i Don't feel like they have much control over the groups succeding or failing.
[5:47:40] OshriMakk: @HairClog It already was in the first week on dragonflight its pretty chill if you know how to play
[5:47:46] TemNoc: @Tile102 doesnt matter, your initial argument was condescending and false
[5:47:46] savarunl: @lazyglue4 please go heal a 25 tyra hyrja and come back saying it's easy LUL
[5:47:55] Tiabbz: Isnt Yoda NA?
[5:48:04] Nasacrim: @lazyglue4 2 times in a 20, do actual high keys
[5:48:13] muyuu: Please only talk if you are high rio (at least 1500+)
[5:48:14] StarShopping95: @lazyglue4 This person has to be trolling ICANT
[5:48:16] smuf187: most of vierwers play +15 keys and judge over healers
[5:48:24] lazyglue_: @savarunl there are maybe 2% of players or even less playing a 25 hov^^  why even compare something that exotic to normal gaming
[5:48:35] lazyglue_: @StarShopping95 ???
[5:48:47] HairClog: @OshriMakk Not a ton the heals can do when dps keeps rolling bursting JUST as it's about to expire
