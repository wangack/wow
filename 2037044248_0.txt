[0:44:58] saund: either farm pre-bis, or you can level 2-3 more to 40, whats more worth first week considering the raid is easy anyway? @JokerdTV

[1:33:11] tyreh1: Buy some Gold in WOTLK and do Ruby Sanctum GDKP ReallyMad

[1:34:10] g0dzilla: Also there is a BIIIIIIIIG diffrence in paying money for gold to blizzard or paying money for gold via 3rd party website...
[1:34:14] minttyy77: 15 dollars for another account to buy gold on is nothing for a gold buyer
[1:34:14] jazzyjoff: Do you know what kind of operation costs that brings? It will mean that the game will get more expensive and for what, modding bots?
[1:34:16] kekinsano: xdx

[1:36:32] shinezlightz: i saw someone buy dark edge for 70k
[1:36:32] Fjung: why would people play era atm?
[1:36:33] tyreh1: do you really think running GDKP´s in SOD is a Problem tho and encouraging people to buy?
[1:36:41] minttyy77: GDKPs distribute wealth but a system based on that increases gold buying and makes it worse
[1:36:41] foxxys856: with all that gold u might as well swap items thats how its going to end up with the gold value
[1:36:47] minttyy77: 100% does

[1:37:07] Jaosix: xff
[1:37:11] LorusTFT: but most sod servers dont have gkdps thats good. will probaly change later
[1:37:11] goldacte: @Flurizz  those guys did not break twitch TOS, why should he ban them?
[1:37:14] CallMeFatMan: YEP
[1:37:14] iTogusa: difficult topic Kappa
[1:37:17] fergbongo: One could say boosting is just as much a problem as gdkp
[1:37:18] FateJ92: its not complicated, you make the raid about using gold to buy gear therefore buying gold gets you more gear
[1:37:22] rafak_1: hopefully livving flame stay locked
[1:37:27] sappers_leadtheway: People buying gold to min max lvl 25 content need to figure out their life very very sad
[1:37:27] Earth_is_Flat_Btw: prolly Clueless
[1:37:28] Pixiieboy: But buying with purchased gold?
[1:37:28] FateJ92: + it's competitive so the more gold you have the more you win
[1:37:31] Flurizz: @goldacte they bought gold, and jokerd just banned a guy for saying he bought gold
[1:37:33] darkbow17: GDKP all the way baby. not gonna waste time losing rolls vs 3 others raiding every week and not getting shit KEKW
[1:37:33] gdkpgold: 11
[1:37:43] surpriseparty20: It all starts with Blizzard not taking action . If they were aggresive af with bots and RMT GDKPs would be fine
[1:37:51] Pixiieboy: So they should ban GDKP :) No need to buy gold then
[1:38:02] FateJ92: yet you are here talking shit against goldbuying, cmon yapgod
[1:38:05] goldacte: @Flurizz did soda and xqc yappin in jokerd's chat?
[1:38:15] sappers_leadtheway: People buying gold to min max lvl 25 content need to figure out their life very very sad
[1:38:17] xmarcaurelx: @JokerdTV  I think Blizzard should make a completely different trading system without gold. Or at least without a tradeable currency.
[1:38:20] Fjung: GDKPs are the solution, not the problem
[1:38:20] LorusTFT: @darkbow17 do sr raids?
[1:38:20] minttyy77: overall, GDKPs likely increase gold buying, plain and simple
[1:38:21] Raw_oce: if they wanted to stop GDKPs they could just make it personal loot lmao
[1:38:22] fergbongo: If you bad gdkp you have to ban boosting
[1:38:23] shalomski: Your shaman poor lol
[1:38:26] LecterSRK: gdkps without goldbuying would actually be good for the game, incentivizes a healthy economy
[1:38:26] fergbongo: ban
[1:38:33] Emil129c: around 5-15g normally
[1:38:40] Pixiieboy: kekw
[1:38:43] trmonx: gdkp pots are only worth because of gold buy
[1:38:44] g0dzilla: @flurizz, just stop trashtalking though...
[1:38:52] Deshi_basara: why is this streamers body so small?

[1:39:00] einself111: ???
[1:39:02] darkbow17: @LorusTFT and lose roll vs others? no thank you. I rather buy the gear and get cut :)
[1:39:03] Kevnxd: COT 󠀀
[1:39:05] gdkpgold: CAUGHT  supporting gdkps

[1:39:08] iTreek: COT
[1:39:09] empyreaNw0w: @Deshi_basara gnome irl, 4.2
[1:39:11] FateJ92: goldbuying is literally a symptom of GDKPs
[1:39:11] gaming5150: docnotL BAN GOLD FARMING
[1:39:12] Pixiieboy: kekw
[1:39:13] g0dzilla: @Lostino there are HWID Bans wich arnt...
[1:39:13] KingShkek: CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE
[1:39:16] sjerooo: ore
[1:39:17] varkshot: GDKP just launder bought gold
[1:39:17] breakasap: I farmed like 300g myself, and now i do gdkps to earn gold and i get to buy some items
[1:39:18] FateJ92: very regarded take
[1:39:19] chunkydruidboi: let's be real. nothing will be done about anything ok
[1:39:20] fiskensfriend: @trmonx if gold buying didnt exist gdkps would still be effective. U just dont understand 101 economics
[1:39:22] varkshot: turn it into gear
[1:39:22] minttyy77: @trmonx you're right but chat is coping, GDKP players get very defensive
[1:39:26] gxniusx: Blizzard investors wont be happy seeing half their playerbase banned ICANT
[1:39:26] trmonx: they cant even SUSPEND buyers how they gonna ban
[1:39:26] VeronicaQTUwU: ppl who say its the cause of gdkp's are wrong xD mount is 1000g consumes + crafting high end proff gear is expensive as well, its not "just" gdkp
[1:39:30] Thomilla: @Lostino streamer lives in 90s he thik its a probmel for player :D
[1:39:31] darkbow17: @LorusTFT even if its sr, others sr your item also
[1:39:32] Slydaer: @FateJ92 why dont you think its the other way around?
[1:39:39] Lostino: @Lostino ikr @Thomilla
[1:39:45] sappers_leadtheway: Nah gdkp needs ban too sorry u have to play the game to earn gold
[1:39:52] xmarcaurelx: @chunkydruidboi Exactly and that's why this theoretical discussion won't apply to the "real world".
[1:39:53] g0dzilla: @flurizz, use ur brain... then youd know though... why wouldnt he bann 2 of the biggest streamer of twitch...
[1:39:59] a_wesker1: ranting about things he doesnt understand again PogO
[1:40:04] afghanxx: yap
[1:40:08] rizcitron: did blizzard confirm gnomeregan to be a 3 day reset ?
[1:40:10] gdkpgold: @sappers_leadtheway  BLELELE
[1:40:12] FateJ92: @FateJ92 because there is very little incentive to buy gold if GDKP wasn't a thing. and it's easier to ban gdkps than ban goldbuyers
[1:40:13] fiskensfriend: ppl who dont understand why gdkps are effective I just assume are subuhmans irl sub 90iq
[1:40:18] Lostino: burly
[1:40:20] proxyhella: ok, no one cares
[1:40:23] jazzyjoff: Mate the gold in wow is a monetary economy and by that design its fundamentally flawed to attract bots / gold buyers. It's basic economics and anthropology
[1:40:26] surpriseparty20: jokerdSus
[1:40:28] Flurizz: @g0dzilla Because he bans other people for the same reason, so you mean power = immunity?
[1:40:30] g0dzilla: @rizcitron not yet i think
[1:40:31] king_lizard_wizard: dont blame gdkp, people who buy gold will always find a way to get boosted
[1:40:34] FateJ92: even in wotlk the only reason to buy gold is to get flying / raid boost
[1:40:35] LorusTFT: but living flame has gdkp or
[1:40:36] minttyy77: @fiskensfriend there are good and bad things to it, its called nuance
[1:40:37] foxxys856: living flame is brutally killed from bots
[1:40:37] Garvell01: barely?? :D
[1:40:43] LorusTFT: on cs eu i never saw one
[1:40:46] g0dzilla: @flurizz, thats how the world goes

[2:03:19] femund16: No, because you can farm items, and the value is equally inflated. yea raw gold true
[2:03:35] FrostsWorld: @femund16 No way you're this Clueless
[2:03:45] kekD: farm items for 20 hours nah im good
[2:03:47] nILEnC: complains about gold buying but happily take s in WC runs
[2:03:47] Brain_Freezed: but you cannot buy more stuff with that gold you made ? @xerobugss
[2:03:57] HattorGG: Lone wolf ally is much more inflated compared to Living flame horde I've noticed
[2:03:59] theruxemburg: you making raid soon? @jokerdtv
[2:04:00] xmarcaurelx: Last Epoch has a system that makes so much sense that i wonder why so many other MMO's so far didnt come up with that trading system. Especially the split between being SSF and being a Trader and making the items bound to an account wide reputation to the system.
[2:04:03] theruxemburg: need to get saved on warr
[2:04:13] flebbooo: c
[2:04:15] Blueninezero: @xerobugss the gold you get from selling your item is worth less
[2:04:15] flebbooo: u
[2:04:29] gunzpewpew: There is an upside to inflation though. Everyone will be able to afford epic mounts and reagents
[2:04:34] itslarsson9: Chatting
[2:04:35] LightBladeStream: ?
[2:04:38] gaming5150: e Pog
[2:04:39] xmarcaurelx: Last Epoch comes out in February
[2:04:43] Exusprime: i dont know what he just wrote
[2:04:46] xerobugss: @Blueninezero dont hold to your money
[2:04:47] gdkpgold: well he couldve done 2 runs already if you did ur own raid
[2:05:00] Blueninezero: what?
[2:05:01] sappers_leadtheway: How about instead of gear dropping you get loot bags in raid and it gives u gear for your spec? Idk man this shits just wack now
[2:05:07] Zyrax11: 1k gold for titan flask ok
[2:05:08] minttyy77: @gunzpewpew monkaHmm
[2:05:13] iamthedude420: hello @jokerdtv , any predictions today? looking to purchase the sister reveal soon
[2:05:16] 0xm0_hk: what upside u kek
[2:05:18] inckz9: @gunzpewpew how is that an upside? getting your mount is a big part of an RPG. accomplishments etc
[2:05:19] LightBladeStream: how do you farm materials on a megaserver?
[2:05:22] nILEnC: inflation is dog shit for casual gamer
[2:05:29] SLlCY: Remove trade window and auction house and everything is fixed
[2:05:30] LightBladeStream: unless ur a mage
[2:05:32] YzieGG: in classic2004 u could not trade raiditems
[2:05:38] snaxx23: @sappers_leadtheway another great idea SeemsGood
[2:05:41] apple_bay: what if everthing ingame matches the inflation?
[2:05:58] kekD: im casual only have 50g
[2:06:04] princeofcake: can someone explain the complexity of the matter to me? If I have not missed anything, you just ban gold sellers and buyers respectively, minimizing frequency of gdkps and slowing the inflation, gdkps obviously cant be fully eradicated?
[2:06:12] Chat_beaute: they can also increase the "normal ways" to get gold, so ppl have enough natural gold to do the usual stuff while farmers/golders can still enjoy it and get rich
[2:06:23] Syzlak3: crafting mats got cheaper
[2:06:26] gdkpgold: @sappers_leadtheway thats ruining the boss dropping loot immersion
[2:06:26] rocketmortonxd: isn't boosting directly related to goldbuying btw ? never bought golds myself, never was able to afford boosts tbh ...
[2:06:30] alzeeeeer: when is lvl 40 coming out ?
[2:06:35] surpriseparty20: Ez
[2:06:36] Jaosix: @Lorthos_Feral KEKShook
[2:06:36] goobygabbies: EleGiggle
[2:06:38] jujujay_myalias: Everyone easily being able to afford epic mount isn't a good thing though. Epic mount is a gold sink that is supposed to remove gold from the economy and regulate inflation.
[2:06:41] znau_: WTS CLOWN HATS - 1 SIZE FITS ALL
[2:06:42] Saiauriel: @alzeeeeer read the title
[2:06:49] DlCCO: remember when reddit andys said that the WoW token would break the economy and cause massive inflation? Yea, these people are idiots and have no idea what they're talking about ICANT
[2:06:58] Lacee666: ads
[2:06:59] Zyrax11: Bedge Muted
[2:07:02] sappers_leadtheway: @gdkpgold nah u still get gear
[2:07:13] sappers_leadtheway: Or gold or w.e
[2:07:19] g0dzilla: @Chat_beaute thats not how a market works... economy isnt easy like that
[2:07:52] goobygabbies: just print more money and give everyone $1k 4Head
[2:07:53] xerobugss: you are not fightning you are just adjusting to it
[2:08:04] nILEnC: u can only afford boosting if u but gold change my king
[2:08:07] feydzhan: just dont allow gold to be traded in dungeons and make the raid items non-tradable after leaving the raid
[2:08:09] saund: do you think premades will be just as big of a thing in arathi basin? @JokerdTV
[2:08:16] Ryanjord: All you're saying is that you're participating in a morally better way
[2:08:22] theruxemburg: thunderbrow ring too
[2:08:23] rafak_1: you participate of this inflation
[2:08:26] rominos88: 15g atm humberts helm
[2:08:28] shalomski: The lvl 31 mana potions sell like hot cakes
[2:08:30] theruxemburg: sold that for 125g now its not even half
[2:08:41] clementdk99: how to counter phase 2 inflation
[2:08:46] saund: @theruxemburg you got it at just the right time rux
[2:08:52] surpriseparty20: U dont
[2:08:52] minttyy77: @princeofcake yeah, its not this simple
[2:09:01] znau_: @theruxemburg thats not inflation, its market saturation.
[2:09:01] Sensefav: @saund ofc it will
[2:09:03] rafak_1: @batwolfomegaprime just prime or sub wtf
[2:09:07] bfdparseskekw: i sold Troll's Bane Leggings 250 now they 170
[2:09:10] kekD: u just buy gold
[2:09:16] mumble1705: thats what im doing right now, flame sacs
[2:09:19] gdkpgold: nah u can buy goldthorn rn
[2:09:23] breakasap: But proffesion will be capped at 200 so we dont know what we can craft
[2:09:29] SluggEU: invest in gold ore like in real life to fight inflation weSmart
[2:09:34] privatebutcher: boosting arrived because of the bots tbh, who would pay 4golds for 1 run, back in the time 4 golds was very hard to farm and you wouldn't throw it on one run to get half level or 1/3...
[2:09:35] einself111: unless bots farm those
[2:09:36] princeofcake: @shastee why not, genuine question?
[2:09:40] femund16: Inflation is nice for casual boomer dad player. Farm random mats for 1 hr buy epic mount for the profit. Atleast that's my experience :D Prob not as good for the hardcore gamer tho
[2:09:43] HattorGG: But then there are herb pots, item bots etc
[2:09:43] clementdk99: i have 500gs atm for honest playing. how do i invest to fight phase 2
[2:09:54] maslaklulzz: @privatebutcher 4g very hard to farm KEKL
[2:09:56] soerensteffensen: @JokerdTV you said that the casual player is the one hurt from gold buying. Don't you think it is primarily casual players buying it?
[2:10:14] theradoor: I got a lot of goldthorn for selling. Unless the prices arent good enough for it. otherwise I convert them to pots which I know people will want for raiding
[2:10:26] g0dzilla: @clementdk99 buy stuff to rank up ur professions maybe
[2:10:26] lebrun_james_: do bots actually make things w professions or just gather raw materials
[2:10:41] YuruNeko1: dont ask jokerd for investing ICANT he lost everything in crypto ICANT
[2:10:42] andreas_bylund: Bolt of runecloth
[2:10:43] mudgemornell: never ask jokerd for advice on investing KEKInsane
[2:10:46] theradoor: imagine being among the first to reach 225 alche can earn mad bank from raid consumes
[2:10:54] LightBladeStream: ask the living essence guy about investing KEKG
[2:10:59] Cy_Kugz: trunks before nerf
[2:10:59] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: maybe salvage units for gnomeregan
[2:11:01] cpthadji: crypto bros KEKW
[2:11:03] Etsku: bank full of leather
[2:11:04] sappers_leadtheway: @jokerdtv like I said only way u can fix this is honestly take the power out of the players hand 1. Get rid of master looter 2. Make loot only appear to the players the spec it suites or specific to 3. Instant boe items only 4. No gold trading in raid and 5. 6 month ban buying gold then a year then perma
[2:11:07] Cy_Kugz: was major stock pile for p2
[2:11:12] brbelmont: @LightBladeStream kek
[2:11:13] DenissGod: i lost 100k$ cuz i listend to jokerd's advice Sadge
[2:11:15] 7idus: materials for rage potions
[2:11:20] shalomski: Easy 5-6g per hour is fishing in stone talon, fish is for the mp5 food and the extra stuff sells fast, plus its chill
[2:11:25] b3njyy114: move away from this fucking waterfall
[2:11:25] Chat_beaute: @sappers_leadtheway makes the game boring and bad tho
[2:11:32] Exusprime: who said get rid of master looter
[2:11:32] cpthadji: @batwolfomegaprime ait see you in 250 years my dude
[2:11:45] LightBladeStream: most ninja looters are needing on stuff they cant use, not raid leaders
[2:11:51] rocketmortonxd: Faps will always be an expensiv thing
[2:11:53] sappers_leadtheway: @chat_beaute the game is already boring and broken
[2:11:54] Anarchi_MLT_: whats the cap for professions next phase?

[2:13:47] YzieGG: will beb better in 3 weeks
[2:13:51] stillmatic1993: @JokerdTV aren't you the leech king of GDKPs? go for it man
[2:13:52] saund: 80% is GDKP, 10% is hardres epic, other 10% is people without gear
[2:13:53] bfdparseskekw: but u said ur servers great KEKW way more gdkps than mine
[2:13:56] Sensefav: For you it takes 2min for create raid LOL be happy with it
[2:14:03] clementdk99: what addon you use for quest log
[2:14:06] WeeNeeber: There are surprisingly few gdkp on crusader eu ally
[2:14:08] LorusTFT: no
[2:14:10] Exusprime: Is that true tho, isnt it just the GDKPs struggle to get players which is why its spammed so much
[2:14:10] Cy_Kugz: rpcrusaderstrike is great I pug raid 8 toons
[2:14:10] nordic_endzeitparty: 👻 Whoo 👻 I am the ghost of Chilledcow 👻 Why did you not heal me, jokerd ? 👻 Why did you let me die? 👻 I could have lived 👻 All you had to do was press NS 👻 Now my soul is stuck in Naxxramas for all eternity 👻 Whoo
[2:14:12] bfdparseskekw: u need global ignore list, u can ignore the word  GDKP in chat
[2:14:15] inckz9: Lone Wolf EU Horde is 90 % non-GDKP.
[2:14:17] einself111: yeah lone wolf is also mostly gdkp
[2:14:18] samopunka: chaos bolt is not
[2:14:19] n0jden: i can be your pvp server IRL @JokerdTV
[2:14:25] sicknope: Crusader strike is not gdkp favored on horde side atleast
[2:14:26] shalomski: @sagerhero_ I play on pve, plus release normally stupid late at night so won't affect me to much
[2:14:27] HattorGG: Lone wolf ally is much more inflated compared to Living flame horde I've noticed
[2:14:32] clementdk99: eu crusader strike there is less than 2% gdkps
[2:14:33] surpriseparty20: The fact that the server is locked is a good experiment to see how the economy is gonna form compared to the other servers .
[2:14:34] gdkpgold: do u rly tink if a guy named grandfarter whispers you that tis guy is a big pumper? xdd
[2:14:35] Egis4: crusader strike eu is mainly sr's
[2:14:39] svendvang: @JokerdTV chaos bolt eu has almost no gdkp's
[2:14:40] WeeNeeber: People flame gs
[2:14:40] Syzlak3: on lone wolf there is still more normal runs then gdkp for sure
[2:14:41] LorusTFT: on crusader strike 1 out of like 50 raids in gdkp
[2:14:45] Lostino: Crusader Strike NA is like <50% GDKP at least when I'm online and rarely I see big increments
[2:14:46] bfdparseskekw: yea 5g min epic pearl 30
[2:14:46] iTreek: KEKInsane ❗
[2:14:47] LightBladeStream: To be fair, there is no reason to raid outside of GDKPs if you have been playing since launch atm
[2:14:48] ciscoxd: I haven't seen any gdkp on crusader
[2:14:48] Chat_beaute: lone wolf is ok, gdkp spamm but most of the raid are traditionnal pugs
[2:14:52] Gurrehh: @WeeNeeber BASEDCIGAR
[2:14:55] twolegdog: PogT I finally stored graham's number
[2:14:56] Cy_Kugz: crusader strike eu fine if you get into good groups my mate does like 4-5+ clears a reset no issue

[2:15:04] bfdparseskekw: @JokerdTV most lone wolf are normal pugs too
[2:15:08] sappers_leadtheway: I'm on lonewolf and I lead all my own pugs ms/os always fill in 10 min tops
[2:15:11] AXE2kGAMlNG: rarely seeing gdkpon crusaderstrike

[2:16:15] rullehjem: @LorusTFT Baseg
[2:16:18] shalomski: How is there so much gdkp on a low bot server?
[2:16:22] Exusprime: I get into pugs on living flame constantly. GDKPs just spam a lot so looks more prevalent
[2:16:26] kekD: time for elwyn forest DMF raid
[2:16:26] normageqq: gdkp kinda cool on living flame, it's affordable for everyone
[2:16:28] Noilane: There are a lot of non gdkp also

[6:41:44] magicianoliver: i think its pretty easy to find a raid as a druid (most people want a feral druid, balance druid isnt that bad as a caster, and resto is the best healer second to priest)

[6:43:30] Rakinos89: pretty sich
[6:43:31] Lostino: they could make a "curse of affliction" rune or something so the enemy takes both effects of reck and ele
[6:43:32] kswissbaby: kswissbaby subscribed at Tier 1.
