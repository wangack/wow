[0:34:56] darkknighticus: @heyitsMart minecraft is the only one that comes to mind currently, most other games generally don't let you see those kind of coords if they aren't voxel or have free access to them.

[0:36:19] Hjolt: i mean in regular 3d graphics Z-axis is the axis of depth. X is horizontal, Y is vertical. the fact that WoW uses Z as vertical is funny as fuck when you think about it

[0:38:33] Nekooooooooo: @darkknighticus i meant the z being height part not the jank hitbox part
[0:38:39] m3wk: It's an 1h buff with crit chance and something else
[0:38:39] ziG_Gy: Sir singsing
[0:38:39] VylIian: you gotta cleanse a corrupted songflower, then one or more people can click at the same time, then it goes on CD for a while

[0:39:48] heyitsMart: darkknighticus, it's more so that many games I've played that have a map/coordinate system tend to use (x,y) for e/w, n/s etc. so if there's a need for referencing height then z is commonly used
[0:40:01] w0mbii: Susge not sure a real owl or a dog named owl
[0:40:03] Opreich: old azshara looks so nice
[0:40:07] VylIian: I would recommend grabbing the azshara flight path on the way back so you can cut down flight time xdd
[0:40:07] Peridotine: tanaris being near silithus makes sense to me
[0:40:13] FireArachna: @nixxquality but don't any field that uses axis use z as the elevation axis? As far as I know it's universal

[0:42:05] darkknighticus: 2D games uses Z for depth which is normal, 3D uses Y for height/depth instead while Z gives that 3rd dimension.

[5:46:43] LetMeDieFirst: @singsing YT actually bad. 1080 on YT similar is similar to 720 on twitch for your stream
[5:46:47] silver0scale: guild master will fix them xdd
[5:46:50] PlainWolfie: needed to get buffs fast to start the raid
[5:46:54] Berksgorh: @MacintoshPLUS21 i alway thought warlock kind a tanky beacuse of all extra stamina they are getting from talents but dude just get one shotted

[5:47:11] Fluffz_86: its just foliage and limited twitch bitrate I guess
[5:47:22] Nekooooooooo: they talking about youtube
[5:47:25] Flashby: @thefakeh the whole shit show was caused by a body pull of additonal pack by mage. 90% his fault 10% healer
[5:47:32] chiziii69: They did ZG and AQ20 yesterday without any deaths
[5:47:35] Father_rat: it’s also looks blurry from me on 1080p
[5:47:38] durianmiru: yep in yt is a bit blurry probably because of bitrate
[5:47:39] MaaaaaaaN: yeah the raids went super smooth he had everyone on discord for it.

[5:48:12] Zeal627: soda analyze it later , the mage accidentally pulled the pack
[5:48:16] nulladdict: youtube does have a better player and higher maximum bitrate
[5:48:18] Myrrshock: they skipped some packs to go faster and the rando mage aggroed it
[5:48:19] niy5678: Serdaka dropped to 1%hp when he got lay on hands
[5:48:23] DrSpookenstein: @MacintoshPLUS21 poke just got fucked by rng, the mobs would all go to soda as he used aoe taunt but the healer boped soda KEK and poke didnt react in time with petri

[6:55:09] deranked: w0mbat , (family Vombatidae), any of three large terrestrial species of Australian marsupials.

[7:26:51] crisbylettuce: ah you need the stats addon
[7:26:53] naps250: I think you need an addon for stats - vanilla stats are awful
[7:26:59] vapo213: @singsing there are addons like Extended Character Stats
[7:27:10] crisbylettuce: vapo213, yup thats the one you want
[7:27:13] KazakiTV: @singsing CharacterStatsClassic is better
[7:27:14] Shotkaa: LVL 50 soon Pog
[7:27:16] barebruh: HYDRATE
[7:27:31] iplaythings: hit rating there is @singsing
[7:27:33] Narazzil: @singsing yes hit there is
[7:27:34] yusba: they added those stats to the game itself in late vanilla or tbc
[7:27:36] vapo213: @crisbylettuce It's the one i used iirc
[7:27:41] BayStreetSix: theres defence cap, but i dont think theres any dps ones
[7:27:45] crisbylettuce: vapo213, yeah i used that one too, works fine

[7:28:40] iplaythings: haste isnt a thing till tbc tho?
[7:28:41] CourtesyOfTom: there’s breakpoints for hit chance for melee and ranged and defense for tanks
[7:28:50] BayStreetSix: theres also. hit cap
[7:29:11] vapo213: Well kind of, if you are hit capped your hit capped, that's the breaking point
[7:29:20] iplaythings: @singsing just a lategame stat, hit and crit rating are both here
[7:29:22] yusba: btw you can see crit chance in spellbook hovering over Attack skill
[7:29:38] Bloodfrey: Do you have the gamoorah quest? the one you take from tanaris. You need to take a picture of the elite turtle here
[7:29:48] CourtesyOfTom: yeah, the hit cap and defense uncritable threshold is what I meant
[7:29:54] zari_zari2020: nope
[7:30:01] Meraut: melee is 8% hit to land on 3 level higher mobs iirc, spell and ranged are 17% and dual wield is 26% i think
[7:30:16] vapo213: Only resistances have breakpoints
[7:30:17] yctnm: not really its mostly linear scaling except for spell damage type resistances
[7:30:18] KazakiTV: Only when it comes to resistances there's key levels
[7:30:27] Alert339: melee has some shit with hit rating because they have glancing blows
[7:30:30] Meraut: the only thing that gives more bonus is expertise or spell resistance
[7:30:37] naps250: care of the horde town

[11:01:27] Berksgorh: @shipduckshaky banned for what ? he was talking about retail
[11:01:29] Meraut: last race to world first, the firstplace team spent 150k euro for the race

[11:02:00] Durminon: no, it is a Gold worth in WoW tokens
[11:02:00] Zbunka: 1 tonek is like 20 euro
[11:02:01] Elfishcow: yeah but thats for consumables and paying people for their loot drop in raid
[11:02:05] ArtoPOE: broke boys fuming
[11:02:06] Zbunka: and it sells for 100k gold
[11:02:07] rfr0zen: wow tokens bought

[11:02:11] Zbunka: fluctuating
[11:02:11] NeradoTV: WoW token = 20 euro
[11:02:16] Meraut: they admitted it, from wow tokens and buying gold, paying for services and items

[11:02:19] bliznak: @Zbunka in hard core there is no tokens

[11:02:36] Durminon: they have used a shit ton of gold, but they don't buy it mostly
[11:02:40] DiaBoLuS_THREE: @claementinator even if you don't, just the feeling of other ppl around me essentially "cheating" with real money kills the whole experience for me
[11:02:40] S_H_O_D_A_N: WoW is secretly a Korean MMO
[11:02:41] luta974: buying BoE/runs/ consumables

[11:03:01] elimud: the world first guilds typically have accounts that they transfer between servers to buy BIS BoE items KEK
[11:03:01] Durminon: you can't buy everything, not even remotly
[11:03:03] DrSpookenstein: you cant tho, gold is mostly useless in retail @singsing
[11:03:04] NeradoTV: You can buy game time or gold from store.  But the gear they buy just matters for RWF raiders, it's min max

[11:35:32] SnowballEOD: Lots of spawns for them in Marudon. I used to run my 60 mage on an herbing route so I could afford my flying mount once TBC released.

[11:35:49] Reticent_88: Both Mara and Dire Maul were added after initial release
[11:36:02] Sandap: zari_zari2020 Yeah it's like $0.05 per. Very cheap.
[11:36:02] SnowballEOD: People wanted the ghost mushrooms for invis pots IIRC
[11:36:02] Nikeyeia: there's 2 different entrances, they meet up in the middle and continue onwards, and you can unlock an item that teleports you there from outside. So really 3 entrances
[11:36:03] Joxedin: we're both correct then, the best outcome
[11:36:04] Reticent_88: I think Mara may have already been in the game by initial EU releasse though

[12:49:28] crisbylettuce: Sandap, classic vanilla was boring af but it was fun because i played with a bunch of RL friends, when they started tryharding and wanted to compete i lost most interest, because i had already done that shit xd
[12:49:36] srs890: 12hr stream? Tf don’t u sleep
[12:49:44] cranor_jp: Sing roll 4 omg

[12:50:01] Biofu: they see me rollin
[12:50:05] Durminon: @crisbylettuce vanilla was fun because know one knew shit and everyone fucked around
[12:50:05] Sandap: crisbylettuce yeah i have no interest in raiding the way people min max, speed run, and take the fun out of everything now PepeLaf
[12:50:51] Holgar94: @srs890 streamer life, sleep and stream FeelsWowMan
[12:50:51] KazakiTV: speedrunning is fun:)
[12:51:01] k4qu: @Sandap google ruined gaming
[12:51:08] Sandap: Durminon back in the molten core days I was on a really shitty d-link router that disconnected periodically. on baron i had to sit off on my own corner while DPSing and everyone would just run at me with bombs Smadge
[12:51:11] crisbylettuce: Durminon, it was the most enjoyable experience, albeit grinding out hours and hours to be fully stacked in a hypercompetitive guild going for firsts
[12:51:23] Eko08: @Durminon also it was created before social media were mainstream. Most people used it as a social platform. Today everyone is using discord and whatnot.

[12:51:59] Durminon: @XcaliburYe hey steve, want to play SoD on thursday?
[12:52:00] Sandap: k4qu kind of, yeah. people also just don't seem to want to play and just learn and understand things themselves anymore. it's all just symptoms of a bigger issue Shrugeg
[12:52:05] KazakiTV: your nature aspect really helps in this dungeon to reduce dmg @singsing
[12:52:06] Zululli: How much are petris atm?

[12:52:41] crisbylettuce: Eko08, that and theres ten billion guides for every boss encounter and spec, rotation, etc. its nowhere close the fun it used to be
[12:52:44] PenitentTang3nt: Clueless
[12:52:44] Reticent_88: But then he wouldn't have Hawk up for the deeps NOPERS

[12:53:32] Durminon: they change so many things, and we only know the datamined things yet
[12:53:37] Sandap: XcaliburYe max level 25, level 25 raid. new items and drops. new runes to put on items that change abilities and give new stuff
[12:53:38] Denog: pulls whole dungeon
[12:53:49] XcaliburYe: oh, interesting is it based on any of the expansions?
[12:53:53] Durminon: no
[12:54:02] Eko08: @crisbylettuce That too, but it's necessary on retail to at least have the in-game guide based on how much more difficult encounters are now. It still takes weeks to clear a new raid. I get the criticism though.
[12:54:04] crisbylettuce: Sandap, classic lost its charm when everyone and their grandmother who have played on pservers for 15 years started playing
[12:54:05] PatrikStjarna: its classic+
[12:54:12] Durminon: it is classic with lots of changes
[12:54:15] indiglo14: pay to roll

[12:55:07] Slaymeh: alliance is way more vertically challenged
[12:55:35] Eko08: @crisbylettuce You could say vanilla was released at the perfect time and place. Now people have changed and WoW wouldn't have been as successful today as it used to be.
[12:55:35] Sandap: crisbylettuce ive stopped looking up gameplay trailers, guides, etc for everything i play and its night and day how much more fun it is KEK

[13:49:34] Durminon: that ring is so good, they will do way more
[13:49:35] crisbylettuce: theres a lot of good stuff from mara
[13:49:40] r_pain: did sing die yet?
[13:49:43] Bali_d: so never Aware
[13:49:51] Durminon: forever sounds accurate
[13:49:53] DuckWeed23: @singsing that dungeon was so long ?
[13:50:02] poopsmith412: mara is fun but its looooong
[13:50:03] hYpErNoYzE: thats a preraid bis for dps
[13:50:03] Strayx: @r_pain Sing is a true gamer he would never die
[13:50:04] Reticent_88: It's not your BiS ring though. You just want 2 of the DM(n) rings
[13:50:09] Durminon: mara takes a while
[13:50:10] Reticent_88: And you can solo DM(n) tribute chest
[13:50:10] ThePenguinFliesatMidnight: yeah
[13:50:11] Joxedin: you can enter at the waterfall area
[13:50:13] DuKeIt0uT: Yeah you can skip purple and orange
[13:50:13] ZemeZ_: princess run is prety short
[13:50:15] Qualdrion: You can skip straight to the hydras
[13:50:17] cranor_jp: it tokes longer for the quest right?
[13:50:17] Bloodfrey: You can just go straight to princess if you got the Rod
[13:50:20] Joxedin: so it's basically a 5 minute stroll to princess
[13:50:39] teng118: slay?!?
[13:50:40] Sleggad: At 60 you can learn the solo tacts for the ring. Even sell runs for the ring to ppl
[13:50:41] DuKeIt0uT: wow thats lit
[13:50:41] Strayx: I thought it was Helmet
[13:50:46] Reticent_88: Bow skill is a bait btw, it's worth virtually nothing
[13:50:55] oni__kage: COPIUM
[13:50:56] HugeAnimeBoobas: legs COCKA
[13:50:59] DuKeIt0uT: 20 agi tho is nice
[13:51:01] Flashby: + weapon skill is so nice vs higher level mobs
[13:51:03] Reticent_88: Yeah unfortunately, skill is only good for melee
[13:51:04] Gems_ldn: dont you just buy Devilsaw later?
[13:51:05] Reticent_88: It does, but not much
[13:51:05] tantalim: hit chance
[13:51:07] DuKeIt0uT: its hit chance
[13:51:09] Qualdrion: Ups hit chance
[13:51:09] Seisdov: Just hit
[13:51:16] Reticent_88: +4 is like 0.16% hit and crit I believe
[13:51:16] Durminon: it is good if you fight against higher level mos
[13:51:18] Eko08: You said it yourself last day, where you don't miss with bow even though you have a low skill
[13:51:19] Durminon: mobs
[13:51:19] n3ther: Not asgoodon range
[13:51:21] Eko08: compared to sword
[13:51:24] boomd93: basically you are a lvl higher than you are
[13:51:24] ThePenguinFliesatMidnight: +weapon skills of your primary weaposn is always good
[13:51:41] Alleleirauh: Why are random rare items sold for 100+ gold? are auctioneers stupid?
[13:51:46] Bloodfrey: did the trinket drop from Noxxion?
[13:51:58] Joxedin: yeah, rare spawn
[13:52:01] Killaahurtz: rare spawn
[13:52:07] Joxedin: he's by where you first encountered the slimes
[13:52:11] nanzz3: when is sing gona comeback to us chat
[13:52:11] Delta_G: yea a rare, its right after the purple section of mara
[13:52:14] nanzz3: to dota to goose goose duck
[13:52:16] nanzz3: to anything
[13:52:17] Reticent_88: Skill is so good for melee because it changes the hit cap for them if they get enough, and also reduces/removes the damage penalty on glancing blows. Neither the case for ranged
[13:52:19] Durminon: @Alleleirauh they are trying to sell them. Most Items don't sell for that price
[13:52:26] crisbylettuce: KEK
[13:52:30] ertot1: You dont care about the cosmetic look?
[13:52:42] ZemeZ_: it was the giant tony boss
[13:52:46] farnsi: HandsUp
[13:52:47] crisbylettuce: ertot1, its classic, everyone looks like clowns xd
[13:52:48] Durminon: @ertot1 in HC?!
[13:52:55] SirKailon: oof level 54 death, yikes
[13:52:59] Bloodfrey: Rare spawns at the start of the dungeon, I believe you can check for him if you go through orange?
[13:53:18] Nightbot: Also live streaming now on Youtube for those that prefer it! https://www.youtube.com/@WehSing/streams

[13:54:09] Biofu: warrior should be able to berserker rage the princess fear too
[13:54:26] Sleggad: Isnt there a pair of legs for you aswell?
[13:54:32] issacar42: she can multihit no?
[13:54:37] Joxedin: she has a thrash attack so she can multihit
[13:54:38] ThePenguinFliesatMidnight: she can absolutely 1shot a clothie
[13:54:41] Reticent_88: Princess could definitely one-shot a Warlock. She has a Thrash (multi-hit) attack
[13:54:41] Bloodfrey: yeah but you can't berserker stance tank princess @Biofu you will die
[13:54:43] seMajors: thrash is some shit
[13:54:45] IcyZzzz: the longer she doesnt attack she can multi hit 4 times instantly
[13:54:46] DuKeIt0uT: Yeah I think she can 4x multi hit
[13:54:47] TrashGoblin_: She stacks multi hit when not attacking
[13:54:59] Zhyren: princess has weird classic thing where she stacks attacks
[13:55:38] SnowballEOD: Thrash buildup from several elites and bosses is bugged in classic, so they can hit you like 9 times in 1 frame if you kite them for a while.
