[1:47:56] xXSiebzehnXx: So based on the size of the wheel you’ll stagger enough players to make them spin similarly and the goal would be to line them up as fast as you can at almost the same time

[1:51:24] Avinar: I've been worried about it
[1:51:30] Lincoln_WoW: domination sockets are a huge problem that a majority of the player base doesn't know about yet
[1:51:42] Avinar: my opinion may not mean much but I'm very skeptical this time around
[1:51:42] Relic7: Blizzard can't afford a bad patch
[1:51:53] tripl3heart: this patch feels like content for max 2 months

[1:52:35] luckfore: feelsbadman
[1:52:39] Lincoln_WoW: the raid felt like the most complete part to me
[1:52:45] TheItalianStallion321: imagine saying its a rushed patch when its 7-8 months
[1:52:50] Kasern: 7 months of covid time though
[1:52:56] Lincoln_WoW: they basically developed 9.1 in real time.
[1:53:01] Xaviiara: At least they'll be refreshed and back at it when mythic raiding opens up.
[1:53:08] xXSiebzehnXx: @joshipooh that and an uncertain degree of getting set up for at home work and a sprinkle of mismanagement
[1:53:10] CardinalTX: Imagine taking time off when customer satisfaction is ay an all time low
[1:53:10] QuickCez: They could do patch for 3 years, and there will be a guy on chat sayin its rushed and then train goes choooo chooo

[1:54:06] Zincore123: @Towelliee Did you see that Bobby got a 155 million dollar bonus?
[1:54:07] Xaviiara: Pretty sure it's the biggest raid testing they've ever done, as in the most bosses.
[1:54:15] xXSiebzehnXx: @horseweave they’re saying it feels like one
[1:54:28] Lincoln_WoW: 9.1 is not as good as good as 7.2 or 8.2 and a lot of people will be diappointed
[1:54:56] Zettabyte: So this is like instead of watching a video on the fights? =)
[1:55:32] Lincoln_WoW: they do not
[1:55:36] Recruitie: @Zettabyte why not both?
[1:55:39] Lincoln_WoW: you need to stay out to tank the aboms
[1:55:50] Horseweave: @xxsiebzehnxx Is it though? You'd think most companies would have a contingency plan for their employers to work at home in case they can't get to work at all...

[4:21:11] conath2: 7:10 conner needs to fight are you going to watch that?

[4:21:21] dalaraz: stun the rage yeah
[4:21:26] Brickneim: if you count 3 secs after the first cast it times up with rage cast

[4:22:14] Vile_: Has any figuring been done on the new seasonal affix as to which lieutenants are worth killing?
[4:22:23] ajax2323: hey at least they are changing that in 9.1 @Vile_
[4:22:26] Vile_: I've seen people say just the fire aura/healing debuff aura guys, then deal with the other two.
[4:22:31] Vile_: @ajax2323 Changing what?
[4:22:43] ajax2323: bucking rampage goes on cd when cast
[4:22:48] Vile_: Oh, nice.
[4:22:50] ajax2323: so you can stun it now and it wont recast
[4:22:50] MattyjTV: at least 1 or 2
[4:22:55] MattyjTV: and id be happy
[4:22:55] conath2: ye we need to get new dungeons not always each year the same
[4:23:01] Kinghorn: you cray cray
[4:23:03] neldorath_: that would be insane for the developers
[4:23:07] xXSiebzehnXx: That’s be sick
[4:23:09] Kinghorn: I would be happy with 1
[4:23:13] planelman: monthly new dungeons
[4:23:13] magemaster225: timewalking m+ do it
[4:23:15] 6MHz: balance nightmare
[4:23:17] SeasonPremiere: Imo, you could use old dungeons to include them in new seasons
[4:23:18] dalaraz: id play retail if we had new dungeons per patch than playing the same for 2 years
[4:23:19] shimwood: I'd like new dungeons and then lock out the old dungeons until the next expansion
[4:23:22] Kelmor: yes, they should reduce them in the first and second patch, then all in the final
[4:23:30] Shadowlemur01: yeah, thats a big gripe with me, I get tired of running the same dungeons every patch over and over
[4:23:32] CardinalTX: FF style
[4:23:42] ToastRP: what I would love is have them make 16 dungeons for the expansion and have a rotating 8 or so active for a season
[4:23:42] Shadowlemur01: or if they changed the loot table
[4:23:43] Lockrocker: nothing stays relevant in WoW anymore
[4:23:47] CardinalTX: make it a daily to do old dungeuns
[4:23:51] Cosmolus: !9.1
[4:23:52] headninja1ncharge: Update old dungeons and just do timewalking

[4:23:56] xXSiebzehnXx: What if they were just different stages of the same instance
[4:24:00] Krue_Sr: dungeon rotations
[4:24:04] Youredoneson666: I think xpacs need more dungeons period. Maybe 6 when it releases, and 6 when .1 of the new xpac hits.
[4:24:07] wuhuzuhu: the manpower alone to make this work for each patch would be insane
[4:24:09] Stahn1993: even if its old dungeons comeback on a patch rotation
[4:24:10] Vile_: @SixFourBoom FF does maybe one or two full dungeons per full-patch -- and none of them are affected by anything like M+, so there's no worry about oversaturation.
[4:24:16] Stahn1993: would love to do some underrot again
[4:24:19] Xaviiara: Why not update all dungeons in the game for current difficulty, so you could run like mythic RFC
[4:24:20] Krue_Sr: but a currency that can be used to purcahse items from the disabled dungeons or available
[4:24:34] shimwood: Mythic WC Kreygasm
[4:24:38] dalaraz: shorter patches with 5-6 per patch than 9 but yeah :p @Towelliee and have all 20~ in the end
[4:24:38] Kelmor: So like 4 in .0, 4 in .1, all 8 + 1 in .2
[4:24:42] Krue_Sr: M+ Shadowfang Keep
[4:25:02] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah, just tune all the old dungeons and roll them all over every expansion towByah

[4:25:05] shimwood: M+ Affix would be to remove dungeon maps LuL
[4:25:06] Vile_: They should totally do a monthly "old dungeon brought to M+ level."
[4:25:09] Vile_: That'd be neat.
[4:25:22] ajax2323: they really like this X.1 mega dungeon - X.2 two m+ dungeons release cycle
[4:25:29] ajax2323: seems relatively easy on the devs
[4:25:46] Stahn1993: i mean i think old dungeon in m+ format would be hard. but legion-bfa dungeons on rotation would be sick
[4:25:53] Nokterian: There not and you already know how it goes
[4:25:57] KragnosWoW: are there any catch up mechanics for 9.1?
[4:25:58] Xaviiara: Or 5 old dungeons made a-new for 2 months at a time, rotating every dungeons in the game.
[4:26:03] Nokterian: there is nothing new about it
[4:26:06] Stahn1993: imo mega dungeons should release the same season in m+ not the next patch
[4:26:07] NovaSun84: Same dungeon, BUT IN REVERSE! Kappa
[4:26:26] CardinalTX: @SixFourBoom I know but why not do like a daily timewalking dungeon. make people want to do older content. Figure out how to make it worth doing. Just a thought
[4:26:29] akia03: @KragnosWoW soul ash gear renown stygia
[4:26:30] Easymode: imagine just taking the LFR wings and throwing them into mythic+ LUL new dungeons!
[4:26:40] ajax2323: we did the reverse dungeon thing in legion
[4:26:40] Kelmor: All I'm saying is they get old fast, rotation would be great for WoW
[4:26:49] Youredoneson666: Just make the timewalking dungeons also be able to be M+, but they aren't part of the season progression. only gear upgrades
[4:27:01] Youredoneson666: IE you won't need them for KSM
[4:27:06] Quecklain: just 4Head
[4:27:36] Siraeyou: I think Cathedral of the Eternal Night was super underrated
[4:27:51] Stahn1993: is bear staying nightfae @Towelliee ?
[4:28:01] Vile_: @SixFourBoom That's the thing. WoW and FF's dungeon laterality aren't the same. FF's dungeons are a part of their roulette system, they're not actually "relevant." The gear and stuff from them isn't useful at level cap. So making old WoW dungeons useful at level cap by "timewalking scaling" wouldn't fix anything. Even the gear from Timewalking raids isn't good to use.
[4:28:24] Dagdaz: we don't have to deal with Raider. io anymore in 9.1
[4:28:24] Siraeyou: The first boss got nerfed a lot I think
[4:28:47] ajax2323: at the very least in the .5 patch after
[4:28:52] akia03: @Dagdaz not going anywhere
[4:28:53] Vile_: But Towel, that doesn't perpetuate the illusion of adding new content.
[4:29:04] xXSiebzehnXx: I personally think if they don’t have to buff or nerf shit consistently in beta they aren’t being edgy enough
[4:29:17] xXSiebzehnXx: There should be far more tuning patches for ptr
[4:30:01] ajax2323: you see some shit in keys
[4:30:25] ajax2323: sometimes i wonder how some of these dps dont forget to breathe in their sleep
[4:30:35] Dagdaz: @Dagdaz the system itself will be in the game so we don't need to worry about things not working or updating in the addon

[4:34:30] redtemplar88: No one wants to do Tyrannical keys. So there answer is make it mandatory.

[4:36:54] Thoreya: beeen too long
[4:37:01] xXSiebzehnXx: Just make a few more good ones and put them in a triple rotation
[4:37:02] KragnosWoW: whats rwf
[4:37:11] Thoreya: race to world first
[4:37:33] xXSiebzehnXx: Or, hear me out, randomize them all, every key when they spawn
[4:37:48] xXSiebzehnXx: Three affixes random, dungeon random
[4:37:49] ArcaneSyntax: I mean if you don't like tyrannical, just push higher on fort and you won't really have to do that much of it.
[4:38:04] Vile_: World Quests 2.0 was a buzz phrase FeelsTastyMan
[4:38:11] xXSiebzehnXx: @arcanesyntax but the system they are implementing in 9.1 makes you have to do both

[4:38:17] McconnelI: world quests 2x longer
[4:38:28] Zr0_gg: Honestly think the Dev team needs to go back to basics. A lot of the things that players loved was design how it was pre-legion when they started adding all these new systems on top of systems.
[4:38:42] Thoreya: people like m+ and that started in legion ^
[4:38:50] Thoreya: so i disagree
[4:39:08] ArcaneSyntax: @xXSiebzehnXx Yeah you can't completely ignore it, sure, but you don't have to do a 15, you can push a fort week higher and then do a lower key for tyrannical.

[4:39:19] Archiee: Legion was WoW at it's best after it got going IMO
[4:39:19] xXSiebzehnXx: Longer wqs, further apart, can’t fly or port between zones unless you 20 all keys
[4:39:21] Nokterian: WQ 2.0 is not what i wanted i never want to be invested in a WQ doesnt make sense it's a WQ LUL
[4:39:29] Thunder4o: same,i love every system also,except corruptions
[4:39:29] ClayMatioNation: Legion and LK are BIS
[4:39:36] Godrick85: legendary grtain was so much fun in legion right ? Kappa
[4:39:40] Thoreya: legion was a perfect expansion for current wow
[4:39:40] xXSiebzehnXx: @arcanesyntax true true
[4:39:46] khadtv: when did you switch to horde?
[4:39:54] Thoreya: now theyre experimenting a bunch and unfortunately missing
[4:39:55] Nokterian: Legion had it's flaws but boy i played it so much
[4:39:58] xXSiebzehnXx: @arcanesyntax but if you want all the portals you gotta 20 everything
[4:40:09] SeizureStoorm: i agree i loved legion
[4:40:28] ArcaneSyntax: @xXSiebzehnXx okay? Are you against having rewards for people who push keys higher?
[4:40:42] gidgeet: gidgeet subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months, currently on a 47 month streak! 
[4:40:43] redtemplar88: If blizz is going to keep adding new systems at least have some last longer then one expansion.
[4:40:49] SeizureStoorm: the class halls questline the artifacts and the combat was still fast paced (1sec gcd)
[4:41:00] Thoreya: i loved essences
[4:41:01] Thoreya: in bfa
[4:41:10] Thoreya: essences saved that expansion
[4:41:10] xXSiebzehnXx: No, I’m against locking things that are merely convenience that would help a lot of the players coming back.
[4:41:15] Bl4ckSauce: when is the new patch guys ?
[4:41:26] Thoreya: @BlackSauceNoodles tuesday

[4:41:38] xXSiebzehnXx: Of players
[4:42:01] CardinalTX: this system helps that system which effects the other system which makes that one system out dated. we need a new system to fix that
[4:42:07] Kreech: They said we're getting tier gear again this expansion or was I imagining that idea?
[4:42:08] 3663Sharad: Conduits, Souldbinds, "legendary-seystem", Torghast... What did I miss?
[4:42:09] Nokterian: azerite gear didnt make sense and the necklace was nothing more than a upgrade for a new level before they added the essences
[4:42:30] SeizureStoorm: azerite gear was gear with talents on it
[4:42:32] ArcaneSyntax: SL just makes a lot of the boring stuff less mandatory, which makes it better than BFA IMO.
[4:42:33] SeizureStoorm: what didnt make sense

[4:48:16] 3663Sharad: I have hopes for 10.0 cause of the roundish feel to it. Maybe a bing bang xpax
[4:48:18] Ithylz: @Towelliee Depends. If we have loads of content, it would still be nice.
[4:48:23] mavericks312: ppl are gonna complain either way its a lose lose for blizz at this point
[4:48:37] ArcaneMaki: I would prefer a good story/lore/raid/dungeons over new abilities
[4:48:52] Bayne77: well, the most important thing is that Blizz pleases ME. Kappa
[4:48:55] Archiee: damned if they do, damned if they don't
[4:49:47] ArcaneSyntax: Also I really like that Blizzard is willing to take chances on new ideas, even if they don't work.
[4:49:50] Ithylz: You can also have fewer systems but iterating on existing and working ones (the ones people like for instance)
[4:50:08] xXSiebzehnXx: @arcanesyntax I’ve always admired that about them
[4:50:12] BuddySinister: RIP
[4:50:17] Aidler: while that is true I also got the impression Blizz became more and more hostile towards it playerbase over time. but that‘s just me
[4:50:25] ArcaneSyntax: I'd rather have Blizzard try and fail, then not try and have the same endgame progression for a 8 years like FFXIV.
[4:50:27] mavericks312: but if blizz carries over systems from a past xpac they will get called lazy
[4:50:31] Secondbreakfasttt: would have been 2 chest sadge
[4:50:33] xXSiebzehnXx: Instead of dumpster if systems they try to fix it because that might help them develop further systems
[4:50:44] 3663Sharad: Housing for 10.0 POG
[4:50:46] ClayMatioNation: Did you get the Blizzard 30th Desk mat @Towelliee
[4:51:06] Zr0_gg: I think there's truth to that but I feel like there's a big section of the player base that feel these systems (Legion Artifact, Azerite Armour, Covenants/Soul Binds) are just bandaid fixes to prop up the shallowness of classes.
[4:51:19] N3llee: @Towelliee you've always seem to have a unique or interesting take on things, curious about your thoughts on the Twitch Gambling stuff.

[4:51:34] Vivelli: tod howard - it just works
[4:51:43] Dumpsterr: artifact knowledge in legion KEKW
[4:52:03] ArcaneSyntax: I also don't think artifact weapons weren't without a bunch of problems that aren't as bad in SL.
[4:52:13] Ithylz: Ideas are good, execution less so and many problems they have are things that aren't thought through enough imo (they can't think of everything anyway) but these are also brought up by the community feedback during beta etc. which should help them narrow problems down
[4:52:37] BuddySinister: oh no
[4:52:56] BuddySinister: Thats a lot of valor LUL
[4:53:15] toobaked1987: You would need 10k?
[4:53:21] planelman: 5 guardian druids in a key can kick ass
[4:54:02] toobaked1987: Blizzard is scared to go back to the basics. I don't understand why, most people are turned off from all the systems
[4:54:03] Youredoneson666: I want old talent trees back. but updated
[4:54:04] lon3wolv: did they release the new patch or not yet?

[4:55:44] Shadowlemur01: Fair good sir
[4:55:58] Alienfromger: mmorpgs need some sort of grind
[4:56:01] KragnosWoW: do you know if the exclusive hoodies and shirts shipped out?
[4:56:14] raldrik: unless they do 9.2 quick it wont get better. Too many people are caught up so 9.1 wont last as long for the full playerbase
[4:56:36] Ambersulfr: Artifact power was cool, I think it comes back for 10.0
[4:56:39] Thunder4o: i dont see a way that 9.2 will be out before Jan 2022
[4:56:44] ArcaneSyntax: They only made anima cosmetic only because people spent the last two expansions complaining about grinding.
[4:56:50] mavericks312: I'd bet there planning 9.2 for November
[4:56:51] Vivelli: ppl adverstise their twitch there all the time

[4:59:58] heltvild: they are probably still behind
[5:00:24] Secondbreakfasttt: sus group

[5:01:48] Zr0_gg: if there's another 7 month patch this expansion is fried.
[5:01:49] Avinar: If we have another 7 month patch, ooof that would be.. really terrible
[5:01:52] McconnelI: that would make SL worse than wod by far
[5:02:10] Ambersulfr: @spoonmanes Tuesday
[5:02:25] xXSiebzehnXx: Honestly at this point, I feel like they’re gonna end it at 9.2.5
[5:02:27] Xaviiara: It would be a disaster
[5:02:29] Arthur_eld: Sylvanas book release seems to be pushed back more for blizzconline since it was going to be released around blizzcon before it was cancelled
[5:02:31] devildriver1919: blizzard....challenge accepted
[5:02:36] mavericks312: 9.2 would be rushed before another 7month drought
[5:02:37] Avinar: F2P games would have almost a better update track record at that point
[5:02:56] Archiee: not going to

[5:03:22] toobaked1987: @Towelliee is Sylvanas looking to be a 15+ minute fight?

[5:05:33] Broomba: no
[5:05:38] MadPrim8: the combat from BDO is beating every single MMO, the combat in wow is kind of old and outdated
[5:05:48] Aidler: we will see.. but I have a gut feeling that Acitivision is reducing investments into WoW
