[4:41:12] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:41:20] exaltyyo: HAHAH
[4:41:29] avenomxx: Chewing on ice can cause gum injury, microscopic fractures in enamel (which can become larger fractures), and even broken teeth. Chewing ice is especially bad for those who have braces or have just had dental work done. And for those with sensitive teeth, chewing ice will most likely worsen, rather than numb, the pain.
[4:41:37] grammydee: Hey Schlemm
[4:41:40] foolay124: all good buddy :)?
[4:41:47] WowGrl: Looks at the color
[4:41:55] SCHLEMM: @grammydee HIII !!!! long time
[4:42:08] henryclair25: the extreme cold of the ice can begin to freeze your teeth to a point the enamel comes off and makes way for your crown chipping away.

[5:36:28] MyratyC: Or its first time
[5:36:40] MyratyC: Damn
[5:36:44] llort_nellots: when u win the fishing contest in stranglethorn u can have a trinket which changes you to a fish it´s really great underwater to replenish oxygen. @Swifty

[5:37:30] ezscaping: Before 15? Challenge accepted!
[5:37:48] lichtv: U died again?
[5:37:48] Moisterised: Rule Nr 1. If the mob has Trapper or Netter in it's name. Don't pull big packs
[5:38:10] MyratyC: 15 u wish lol. Hogger gonna kill you at 7.
[5:38:10] SergeantPepper: made it to 30 on my first, died yesterday because unfocused :(
[5:38:38] TemoBlanks: I dont think WoW was designed to be able to never die.

[5:39:59] hellslayer6969: Swifty, Swoops can execute you
[5:40:02] MyratyC: I think HC needs like seasons with around 8 or 12 month cadence where you get unique rewards for reaching 20,40 and 60. Mounts, tabards etc.
[5:40:03] MoWarcraft: Grats!
[5:40:13] benjahshx: u can group just for instances
[5:40:22] WowGrl: @TheBlasphemia That's horrible!

[5:41:23] MyratyC: Which one is easier to lvl horde or alliance?
[5:41:33] Moisterised: @TheBlasphemia Yup. Was so tired and felt so stupid after, haha
[5:41:47] MyratyC: I know routes better on alliance and I think Kalimdor is more dangerous
[5:42:14] TemoBlanks: is saying mmos auto moderated?

[5:43:53] usersworld: tampa bay server
[5:43:58] Drascho27: Battlepass in wow?
[5:44:16] MyratyC: IF they announce somthing major they should do before or after Diablo IV release to keep the hype
[5:44:17] MrMestar: All that HC leveling builds an appetite
[5:44:18] Voodoodippin: Swifty can you play the quest dialog with the Arthas music
[5:44:22] oathium70: the new data mined stuff is leaning to SOM season 2 , the HC community is a very niche thing that is not a long lasting option

[5:45:05] Drascho27: I kinda feel like hc is best left as just a addon/community thing
[5:45:08] chadgigadome: yea but not what, that's why I said it could be anything :)
[5:45:09] iLbus: SOM season 2 maybe
[5:45:10] hailstormz: could be SOM2
