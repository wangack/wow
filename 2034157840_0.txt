[3:56:16] lordpennypacker: you cant really get good at classic pvp without a 144hz monitor and a 6-7 ghz cpu
[3:57:06] gamedemon010: you should look up what panel they use , usually there on 3 factory who manufacture print to LCD's
[3:57:41] chum1y: the g2g response time on the old zowie 360hz was 4.8ms which isn't even enough to keep up with 360hz
[3:57:57] chum1y: so im assuming that this 540hz is bullshit as well
[3:58:09] gamedemon010: i only hear great things from people with those high refresh rate
[3:58:38] chum1y: so ur paying 600 or more for a pro monitor that cant even perform as labelled.
[3:58:40] sheridien: !addons
[3:58:40] StreamElements: https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissModernGnatLitFam-RDRG7o_9M27ESPw8
[3:58:41] gamedemon010: its definitely  noticeable
[3:58:46] chum1y: because pro fps shooters do it
[3:59:26] chum1y: if they can't draw the frames fast enough on that monitor its essentially worthless tech.
[4:00:24] Jyger: I got a fresh mage, mostly pre-bis
[4:00:44] andreas_bylund: latency?
[4:00:46] wafflezzzzzzzs: refresh rate
[4:01:24] chum1y: yeah but u need to have a machine fast enough to keep up with that refresh rate.  TN panel?  it won't have response time fast enough.  0% chance.
[4:01:31] chum1y: not even to keep up with 360hz
[4:01:39] chum1y: so it's snake oil
[4:02:42] chum1y: no i'm going to the poros on TFT central that are the smartest, and i'm reading what they have to say about it.  because they test the shit for a living.
[4:02:48] chum1y: pros*
[4:03:20] chum1y: because i used to be a pro shooter player and i know where the good information is rather than relying on hearsay
[4:03:31] Lmgd1: ZOWIE XL2546X

[4:06:41] qiip_fabi: AlienPls
[4:06:52] Synhra: How much Gold you have
[4:07:03] fleckalwow: hahahhaha
[4:07:19] chum1y: ok i went and read some more and it says these benQ ultra fast refresh monitors: "not fast enough to keep up with a high 360Hz refresh rate, which results in a low 27% refresh rate compliance"
[4:07:24] Synhra: no its 5€
[4:07:28] fleckalwow: yeah he did he said where is my mail from lmgd KEKW
[4:07:28] zhoode: He wants 1 cheeseburger
[4:08:04] chum1y: just get the alienwares.  the panel tech can actually handle the grey to grey response
[4:08:21] chum1y: benq is snake oil

[4:10:13] totti_3k4: sus
[4:10:33] chum1y: i would prob get an acer
[4:10:43] chum1y: OLED tech can handle fast refresh times
[4:10:49] dardysing: I always thought alienware had inflated prices for what you got in terms of hardware.
[4:11:07] lordpennypacker: its just overpriced
[4:11:09] lordpennypacker: always has been
[4:11:11] dardysing: There was always cheaper alternatives with better hardware
[4:11:13] gamedemon010: Ben Q just had good sponser ship with E sport teams that's all
[4:11:14] chum1y: just overpriced is correct
[4:11:15] snackymax: Ive heard shittalk about alienware, alot
[4:11:16] sheridien: no sponsoring delivered by alienware :)
[4:11:26] gamedemon010: most of the time its the no name brands wich peform well
[4:11:27] billybeer181920: it's probably shit, but nobody can be bothered testing Naga stuff again
[4:12:03] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: my dad works at alienware and he said your sponsor opportunity is done
[4:12:14] Ducklicioux: sup?
[4:12:22] dardysing: Gotta go for BENQ sponsorship now
[4:12:48] chum1y: lmgd, there is a website called tftcentral.  they have the best testing methodolgy for monitors.  i only really trust their reviews.  everyone else is just shit.
[4:13:18] sheridien: benq sponsored mousesports like 15 years ago maybe more :D good basements were built i guess. kappa.
[4:13:27] zhoode: 800 lol
[4:14:00] krotkowidze: JEBEM TI MAJKU PICZKU LMGD MMR KEKInsane JEBEM TI MAJKU PICZKU LMGD MMR KEKInsane JEBEM TI MAJKU PICZKU LMGD MMR KEKInsane JEBEM TI MAJKU PICZKU LMGD MMR KEKInsane JEBEM TI MAJKU PICZKU LMGD MMR KEKInsane JEBEM TI MAJKU PICZKU LMGD MMR KEKInsane
[4:14:01] chum1y: just 1080p TN panel seems like tech from 2005.
[4:14:16] chum1y: benq has fast 2005 tech.
[4:14:59] chum1y: but the price on that panel should only be like 200.  600 is obscene.
[4:16:40] billybeer181920: it gives exp already
[4:16:42] billybeer181920: so yeh
[4:18:09] zhoode: are bg mark returns giving xp?
[4:18:37] lordpennypacker: sounds sweaty
[4:18:39] bellpumps: can't you just mail restore 1800 marks all the way to 40?
[4:18:58] zhoode: okay big
[4:20:33] Jyger: Think it's like 800xp per turn-in
[4:20:57] Jyger: Atleast that what wowhead says for the quest
