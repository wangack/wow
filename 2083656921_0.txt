[0:28:00] Im_Guu: last weird print I did was in a Photography shop

[0:32:06] LumiLightz: I was about suggest teaching at uni but I feel like there are still mostly (grown up) children
[0:32:09] RichardPPPan: agree
[0:32:12] manbulance_: naguura and ‘kids’ do not meld it is known
[0:32:12] RichardPPPan: hard agree
[0:32:37] applefactory: I became a journalist because of my primary school English teacher

[0:39:54] RichardPPPan: @novhakin NAHH i mean she barely even have time to chat about things. i told her to change job hmmMeeting but like its also hard to find jobs as well
[0:40:04] pottm: its another word for pfannkuchen
[0:40:33] applefactory: friends who teach say the stress is as much to do with no school funding from government and dealing with kids who come from really messed up homes.
[0:40:34] pottm: es heißt eierkuchen um es abzugrenzen von normalem kuchen, der auch eier enthält
[0:40:50] pottm: i like french omlette more

[0:42:25] DjinDjarinTTV: <3
[0:42:51] silentstorm0533: I honestly thought English was your first language for a minute! it sounds amazing!
[0:42:55] LumiLightz: Most of us germans have such heavy accents that I would have never guessed you were german until you mentioned it
[0:42:56] vratko18: you from germanyyy ?
[0:42:58] DjinDjarinTTV: DjinDjarinTTV subscribed at Tier 3. 
[0:43:02] enok92: english is my 3rd language and it's probably the one im better at xD
[0:43:04] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[0:43:09] JamesOlogist: also depends on the specific country's allocated resources towards education and the conditions in which education takes place. Here it's a thankless job. Get paid nothing, most schools don't even get textbooks, and a lot of schools are actually in cargo containers and mud huts
[0:43:10] Kuroz: she's from South Tyrol
[0:43:24] DjinDjarinTTV: yeah yeah!!!
[0:43:30] DjinDjarinTTV: she was starstruck!!!

[0:46:20] voyage_icarus: Huh, europe is wild with languages
[0:46:56] voyage_icarus: Didn’t think German would be the common tongue in a region in Italy

[0:47:08] manbulance_: what side of the wall are your family from Haha2020
[0:47:10] RichardPPPan: hmmMeeting
[0:47:26] DjinDjarinTTV: @voyage_icarus the languages are not the issue, there are germanic, roman, slavic and scandinavian languages, and most of the languages go back just to dialects
[0:47:33] Ren26: "die murder"
[0:48:02] Minijorgen: As a Norwegian, I can relate. Both words are the same here aswell
[0:48:12] accessdenn: murder is mord in german
[0:48:14] Todbringli02: Does is happen sometimes that you forget to change the Language? so you speak in stream english and after stream you talk to a friend and you want to speak german but you speak english? :)
[0:48:22] RichardPPPan: european languages r not that bad compare to asian multi language people Deadge
[0:48:25] voyage_icarus: @djindjarinttv oh yeah didn’t mean it’s an issue. I’m just not familiar with european geography and distribution of cultures, languages, etc.
[0:48:37] JamesOlogist: apologies for a negative take on the teacher thing; I don't read the room well sometimes

[0:50:30] DjinDjarinTTV: spanish of all things xd
[0:50:36] voyage_icarus: numbers in Urdu/Hindu are kinda same. first half of number corresponds to the ones place, second half corresponds to the tens place
[0:50:49] Tenivir: i found spanish the easiest language to learn, still takes time though
[0:50:55] RichardPPPan: espanol hmmMeeting

[0:54:08] RichardPPPan: @Thorian92 Sure was trying some polish in duolingo while doing swedish. and u can never speak my native language chinese anyway
[0:54:23] DjinDjarinTTV: when you master it, make your own 'tirolthemed' jingles for stream? just thinking out loud XD
[0:54:31] AceReformed: Wdym you made soldering great stream content HUH You'll find a way to make accordeon stream entertaining naguuraEZ @Naguura

[2:48:12] RichardPPPan: naguuraNotes
[2:48:39] praeto10: Yeah pretty much, only with Devoker. I've played it since returning to a decent level and now want to play something else. I also don't want to have to gear and relearn everything and feel I will just be decent at every class because I dont give it enough time

[2:53:19] AceReformed: KEKW I Still can't get over gillette no many times I hear this song
[2:53:19] greypapi: Ulduar, Firelands and Nighthold are my top 3
[2:54:17] IAmJoey: question, when people eat bananas, do you guys open them from the top or the bottom. I will say anytone that opens from stem is factually wrong
[2:54:37] Fakt2: I loved nighthold
[2:55:00] Kuroz: someone in twitch chat*
[2:55:06] IAmJoey: he is wrong
[2:55:36] maktax: it is actually easier to open from the bottom
[2:55:40] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:55:45] praeto10: You don't mush the end then though so it's infinitely superior
[2:55:51] IAmJoey: if you open it from the bottom, you get none of the brown shit at the bottem of the banana

[2:56:10] maktax: no resistance compared to opening it from the top
[2:56:30] nastye: open from bottom because thats how monkeys do it YEP
[2:56:33] IAmJoey: the way to open is to squeeze the bottom, it will split open
[2:56:44] IAmJoey: so you dont have to break, it is actually faster and easier
[2:56:49] iStreamSunday: monkeys open them from the bottom, the stem sometimes just bends and doesn’t open
[2:57:00] IAmJoey: this
[2:57:02] IAmJoey: ^^
[2:57:19] IAmJoey: if you squeeze the bottem it splits open
[2:57:19] y0rge: with knife
[2:57:29] IAmJoey: no
[2:57:35] SerThunderbeans: You pinch it, the slices of the skin come apart, and then you grab one and peel it off EZ
[2:57:37] greypapi: plsma cutter
[2:57:42] ivn31415: someone arrest people who eat banana with a knife
[2:57:43] iStreamSunday: if you pinch the bottom it just splits opens very easily with your fingers
[2:57:43] greypapi: *plasma cutter
[2:57:50] mika01: use a hammer
[2:57:51] combobulous: Potassium is radioactive, you can keep your nanners
[2:57:52] SpeciousArgument: i bet that'll save you 5-10 seconds over your lifetime
[2:57:55] miseri20: With Sisssors
[2:58:00] Ziane: you pinch the bottom thing and just peel
[2:58:04] IAmJoey: if you squeeze the bottom, it splits open
[2:58:05] SerThunderbeans: You pinch the bottom tip of it, and the ends of the slices are easily separated that way... this is how MONKEYS peel a banana, and they're PROFESSIONALS
[2:58:16] littl3mike: so im confused. if you pinch you squicsh and you open from the top you squish. this is one of those quirky preference things
[2:58:18] IAmJoey: only the bottom
[2:58:29] IAmJoey: try it
[2:58:33] Kendobo: Kappa why would anyone pinch their banana Kappa
[2:58:43] iStreamSunday: you’re not hurting the banana any more than snapping the head off lol
[2:58:43] SerThunderbeans: Try it, it blew my mind, my life was altered forever for the better NODDERS
[2:58:43] IAmJoey: you have a handle as well to hold on to which is the stem
[2:59:12] littl3mike: exactly. and who needs a handle? its not that hard to hold LMAO
[2:59:22] IAmJoey: you dont need it, but its ncie
[2:59:26] SerThunderbeans: peeling it from the stem seems idiotic after you learn the pinch-bottom method NODDERS
[2:59:29] ninkarlo: wait you dont eat it with the peel?
[2:59:33] nastye: yeah the stem argument is bad, but opening from the bottom is actually effortless
[2:59:43] Freddyfx36: return to monke peel bottom
[2:59:59] IAmJoey: opening it from the stem genuinely takes more effort, than if you peel it from the bottom
[3:00:00] IAmJoey: try it
[3:00:02] svtragic: your mind is thinking bananas and your face is dissapointed
[3:00:14] littl3mike: its all effortless lmao. i don't get exhausted from peeling it from the stem
[3:00:14] SerThunderbeans: @Freddyfx36 peepoHappy He knows! One of us! One of us!
[3:00:28] IAmJoey: minmaxing bananas
[3:00:33] IAmJoey: I am a dps player
[3:00:37] greypapi: This ppl made opening a banana almost political statement xD
[3:00:39] iStreamSunday: maybe @naguura likes only very ripe bananas so they just open easily
[3:00:39] ivn31415: Tell me you are an overthinker without telling me
[3:00:43] miseri20: Gotta min max bananas
[3:00:53] vikutoru11: Good morning naguuraClap
[3:00:56] IAmJoey: If I don't minmax, my brain will explode
[3:00:59] sticklkanickl: you save a lot of energy opening from the bottom, i agree
[3:01:04] Freddyfx36: naguura reject monke
[3:01:08] Kuroz: CatDriving @vikutoru11
[3:01:11] gaminggshrimp: the whole "phew whish i had a tool for this task"
[3:01:13] SerThunderbeans: it's a difference of like 10% effort to 0% effort
[3:01:13] nastye: i think the thought process is "oh theres a better method according to monkeys all over the world, maybe i should adopt this method"
[3:01:15] AceReformed: I'm a savage sometimes, I snap it in the middle Shruge
[3:01:19] SerThunderbeans: It's still a 10% improvement
[3:01:26] vikutoru11: @kuroz hmmMeeting
[3:01:28] iStreamSunday: just eat the peel lol
[3:01:30] IAmJoey: just try it, and we will come back to this argument
[3:01:37] miseri20: Can we SIM how to open a banana?
[3:01:41] SerThunderbeans: or actually, infinite improvement, because the other method is 0%
[3:01:44] iracaelum: we parsing banana opening methods now
[3:01:50] Every1sFavJ3RK: I've never agreed with you more than I do right now lol
[3:02:04] Ziane: lets make her never forget ^^
[3:02:09] IAmJoey: We are minmaxing, opening from the bottom is just faster and better.
[3:02:13] combobulous: Everyone that keeps saying open it from the bottom is so lost, the stem part is technically the bottom of a nanner @Naguura so you're right according to them
[3:02:22] SerThunderbeans: I'm starting to think Naguura's just trolling the chat for entertainment points on this subject Susge
[3:02:42] azazels_armies: what kind of bananas you guys talking about? flexible banana?lol
[3:02:53] miseri20: So chat when openning a banana, do I run Single target or AoE to Sim it?
[3:02:57] iStreamSunday: it’s all about the ripeness
[3:03:09] Freddyfx36: bananamaxxers in shambles
[3:03:09] IAmJoey: @miseri20 aoe, just mush em
[3:03:13] Hellgrinnnn: the only true rule of banana eating is no eye contact
[3:03:13] iStreamSunday: a very ripe banana will open with very little resistance
[3:03:58] IAmJoey: But have you ever tried opening a banana from the stem, and you bent it. and its just flexxible
[3:04:01] IAmJoey: and it doesnt snap open
[3:04:03] nastye: @Hellgrinnnn unless... 😏
[3:04:24] Kuroz: this can't be a serious conversation
[3:04:31] IAmJoey: no
[3:04:33] IAmJoey: this is serious
[3:04:50] ivn31415: Love how nagura is playing 28+ and reading chat and chilling. and when im playing 21+ im sweating my bannanas off
[3:05:01] AceReformed: @Hellgrinnnn no the real rule is, bring your banana to your mouth, not your mouth the banana KEKW
[3:05:03] IAmJoey: minmaxing bananas is a very serious topic

[5:09:54] Thunderstruq: Only thing that is worse for melee in that fight is that you usually have both Ice spawns that will effect you while range usually don't have more then 1

[7:01:09] Kuroz: !afflicted
[7:01:09] StreamElements: https://wago.io/dNQk28ECr - https://wago.io/afflicted
[7:02:30] lasseh21: do you play other characters than druid?
[7:02:37] Kuroz: not really
[7:02:57] Kuroz: only if druid is bad in every situation or at the start of a patch for the guild hc raids
[7:03:14] lasseh21: she is blasting tho, but i dont play it so i cant relate :(
[7:04:57] lasseh21: she must be 0,1
[7:05:18] Kuroz: atm, she's not in the rank 1 cutoff I believe
[7:05:19] lasseh21: im trying for that aswell, but +26 is currently my max ..
[7:05:24] Kuroz: she was in previous seasons

[7:06:01] lasseh21: but the dreaming here title is in the bag i guess
[7:06:05] VintageLock: Any idea what the cutoff is likely to be @Kuroz - Not that my sorry ass will make it LUL
[7:06:05] syzurup: i had 4 mins to burn before work, got hit with 2.5 mins of ads

[7:06:36] AceReformed: I get complimented when i give people BoP on mechanics, it is very weird honestly KEKW
[7:06:50] Kuroz: @VintageLock might get above 3.7
[7:07:02] Kuroz: 3700 and change at the end probably
[7:07:05] VintageLock: D: ok. Not for me then this time LUL
[7:07:07] lasseh21: m+ pugs in higher keys is mostly toxic, actually demotivating
[7:07:11] AceReformed: near 4k is top now, so probably 3700 and above
[7:07:43] VintageLock: @AceReformed naguuraBless snowmiHypers
[7:08:04] AceReformed: Hey vintage naguuraSwole hows it going bro
[7:08:07] bielich132: @lasseh21 it really depends on key range. doing +28s atm and people arent toxic
[7:08:11] ChaosRenown: i thought moonkins just spam starfall so anything more than that is impressive
[7:08:15] Shifter2k: how many hunters are at the top xD
[7:08:21] bielich132: but when i played my alt on 22-25 keys, people were the most toxic ive ever seen
[7:08:40] VintageLock: @AceReformed Good. Too much work to do, not enough twitch time but cant complain :)
[7:08:57] AceReformed: Nah even in 28-30 people can be a bit clowny, getting into keys is the biggest challenge once you start pugging 27 and above
[7:09:02] lasseh21: @bielich132 23-26 is. i can vouch. Maybe cuss the 28 is on another level mechanical
[7:09:21] lasseh21: and my char is not even meta ..
[7:09:30] AceReformed: @VintageLock Nice! im the exact opposite, not enough work and too much twitch time KEKW
[7:09:40] bielich132: @AceReformed ye it is. sitting in LFG since around 13:00 kekw
[7:09:43] VintageLock: KEKW
[7:10:04] TiPera: @bielich132 playing queue simulator? KEKW
[7:10:18] lasseh21: the wait is crazy in higher keys, like it aint even fun anymore
[7:10:44] TiPera: u literally afk more than u play keys @lasseh21
[7:10:48] AceReformed: Yeh it is the main reason why i am not pugging higher then 28 currently, I spend 2-3h getting into a group that depletes on first few pulls Shruge
[7:10:50] TiPera: :[
[7:11:00] bielich132: ye. just missing the last 2 28s this week and dont get any invites since 3 hours and just watching streams. as ameta class :D
[7:11:01] AceReformed: I'd rather enjoy good games
[7:11:51] bielich132: so i play around +25 keys on my alt, but the toxicity while being band is crazy
[7:11:51] TiPera: they should do something to the system but i dont think they care that much
[7:12:09] lasseh21: my mains is just on  the shelf, getting the vault in. But i enjoy the grind with the lower itlvl char.
[7:13:04] lasseh21: We are too deep in now boys, learned the routes, the interrupts. Cant back down :(
[7:13:55] AceReformed: I'm not doing any high keys at all, trying to get r1 in pvp currently Despairge It's argueably worse then afking in que for keys KEKW
[7:14:10] murksi: soon all these mobs will be 30% slower Plotge
