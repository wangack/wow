[3:33:03] terriblyat: Mythic raiding is a full time job
[3:33:25] terriblyat: Worse at progression

[3:33:45] uwuphoria: look at that #1 dps spot. cobaltEZ
[3:33:45] terriblyat: Pushing keys is insanely hard too
[3:33:55] EngeltheFallen: mythic raids are the hardest content in the game
[3:34:05] terriblyat: @drewdoob mythic is a lot a lot a lot harder
[3:34:08] Heavenly_Heathen: a think a bunch of people here have also played WoW before when this content was new, so they make it look extra intimidating with their knowledge
[3:34:08] terriblyat: Like
[3:34:12] terriblyat: Too hard
[3:34:28] EngeltheFallen: yeah mythics raids are meant to challenge the absolute best players

[3:37:18] Centurion_Havoc: still looking for the other ring in here?
[3:37:27] terriblyat: R14 grind in classic though
[3:37:40] terriblyat: That’s the mythic content of classic lol
[3:37:45] uwuphoria: @Heavenly_Heathen 14 billion is the number from 2004 to 2022
[3:38:00] Rionok: I really wish MMOs tried to do GW2's WvW system. It's just so fun.
[3:38:07] Rionok: I think WoW could pull it off even
[3:38:15] terriblyat: That’s excluding china most likely @uwuphoria
[3:38:18] uwuphoria: @Rionok GW1 is better in my opinion but sure
[3:38:22] terriblyat: Cos netease used to run wow china
[3:38:33] uwuphoria: probably
[3:38:35] EngeltheFallen: god i remember the fun of holding HoH in GW1
[3:38:36] Rionok: GW1 is better as a game, but WvW is rad
[3:39:18] Heavenly_Heathen: Hot damn. It's so wild theyre still able to milk mucho mula out of this game
[3:39:19] terriblyat: @cobaltstreak no poison cleanse pots for aq?
[3:39:30] uwuphoria: tho i havnt played GW2 in years, havnt touched a single xpan so it could be better now i guess
[3:39:39] EngeltheFallen: he can get them if needed during auctions
[3:40:10] Rionok: @uwuphoria recently got back into it, slowly going through the story content. Genuinely the best implementation of mounts I've seen in an MMO
