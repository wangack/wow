[0:47:04] pedrayy: @j_bar111 the passive reduces dmg taken the first time from X target, including pets, thats why its good vs demo locks

[0:47:23] j_bar111: @j_bar111 interesting thanks

[5:54:39] slinks_tv: All caster think they are giga brains lol
[5:54:41] ably: @King_Coffee1 Played since bc, you're twisting my words tho so no point arguing
[5:54:57] King_Coffee1: you are literally saying casters are harder to play than melee
[5:55:07] Fizzibubele: Casters BrokeBack
[5:55:08] King_Coffee1: which is not true at all
[5:55:50] barnowlscary: should just not allow demo in rated pvp lol
[5:55:50] ably: You're right DH and Warrior are much harder my b
[5:56:03] ably: Rets pretty hard too 4Head
[5:56:05] RandyTheRam1: hardest to play is the game in general, caster or melee Kappa
[5:56:11] King_Coffee1: they aren't, ranged and melee are equally as hard to play LUL
[5:56:31] ably: Ok then what if i said more punishing is caster?
[5:56:48] RandyTheRam1: tru
[5:56:50] King_Coffee1: you think its not punishing being a melee?
[5:57:05] slinks_tv: Caster very hard. Offensive CDs - clone. Defensive CDs - clone. No CS or cc for healer - clone. Don't know what to do- clone
[5:57:05] King_Coffee1: like play a melee into a caster cleave and see what you think is more punishing LUL
[5:57:06] JoshThePaladin: FamilyMan
[5:57:22] slinks_tv: Very very high skill level of casters - clone
[5:57:29] Moobot: Now you can jam to the WoW Esports Anthem anytime! https://youtu.be/dkaFaUiJCFw
[5:57:32] Fizzibubele: casters dont cast anymore these days, the only difference is, that casters have 40 yards range on skills and melees dont LUL
[5:57:45] Okiesmokie: @free_rich_campbell Your name did not age well
[5:57:54] fefefen: casters are much harder to hop into than melee, at high level it equals out for most classes of course
[5:58:05] King_Coffee1: theres a reason melee aren't played in awc all im saying
[5:58:11] t3ki7h4: 9o6
[5:58:20] ably: AWC doesnt define the average wow player holy
[5:58:21] slinks_tv: Good ol' caster copium
[5:58:38] Fizzibubele: @fefefen Kappa
[5:58:51] King_Coffee1: @fefefen thats not even true, think of a warrior who has no clue what to do they literally wont do anything at all
[5:59:25] fefefen: warriors are apes
