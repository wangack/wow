[0:51:48] kindapsycho: @pongo72 im from glasgow :)
[0:51:50] Puhtehdough: I wanna hear your opinion. With Microsoft acquiring Activison-Blizzard, do you think WoW Gametime will be included with GamePass for a slight price increase a month?
[0:52:09] Effin_Steffin: @DrkPhoenix6913 it's so annoying
[0:52:46] DrkPhoenix6913: @Effin_Steffin even though i have it off, having to check it, ok, go back in uncheck, ok  - so damn annoying every single day or reload :P
[0:52:53] mavericks312: @Puhtehdough why mess with a money aking machine
[0:53:22] Effin_Steffin: @DrkPhoenix6913 i have to do it everyday on 26 alts
[0:53:36] DrkPhoenix6913: @Effin_Steffin ooooooooof
[0:54:00] zridzz: do you think wow will ever have a sword and shield dps spec. i heard something bout glad stance in WoD but they removed it
[0:54:47] Puhtehdough: @mavericks312 you never know sometimes LUL crazy stuff happens everyday
[0:54:47] Molvonos: Gladiator Stance was garbage dps and only appealed to a niche group of folks; so highly doubt they'll bring back a 'tank' dps spec.
[0:55:00] Kakotan2143: Is today the day for the new Diablo 4 patch @Towelliee ?

[0:59:35] Lintgamer: @Towelliee You think they make crests BoA in 10.1.7?
[0:59:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: When Brewmaster was in the AWC, it was wild
[1:00:21] Stixxerz: release 10.1.7 arround same time starfield releases
[1:01:24] mavericks312: @Stixxerz who ever isnt playing early access is probably waiting to see how it runs first
[1:02:31] mavericks312: exactly its better to wait and see with a bethesda game lol
[1:02:49] tonyr23: Stanfield looks good but probably a week play through that's it
[1:03:33] mavericks312: @tonyr23 storyline most likely but you can travel to like 100 other planets
[1:04:08] mavericks312: i think its straight single player
[1:04:29] Stixxerz: @mavericks312 yeah i am still conflicted between pre-order and waiting for how it runs
[1:04:47] mavericks312: gotta put starfield on the back burner with 10.1.7 and mk1 releasing in the same month
[1:05:18] thegillthrill: september is busted with starfield and the cyberpunk expansion
[1:05:21] mavericks312: mk 1 looks to good to pass up
[1:05:36] Anntohn: will you continue baldurs gate? :)
[1:05:37] Molvonos: They took it from Diablo 4
[1:05:50] SphinxyOCE: 25% buff it looks like
[1:06:19] mavericks312: is the cyberpunk expansion free?
[1:07:07] Anntohn: @mavericks312 yes
[1:07:17] Ezekyler: i think Cyberpunk expansion is 30$
[1:07:31] Puhtehdough: i still never bought nor played Cyberpunk. Gotta do that soon
[1:07:36] mustbepog: how long we been running the paladin?
[1:07:41] mavericks312: with how bad that game was at launch it should be free
[1:08:04] thegillthrill: they fixed their wrongs, the game is great now
[1:08:06] Puhtehdough: Ill wait until a sale or look elsewhere for a key

[1:08:29] Molvonos: Unsure though, they haven't made BFA soloable
[1:08:32] Mecabeast: youll need 3 people for ghuun i think
[1:08:36] Ezekyler: it's a paladin
[1:08:37] Ezekyler: √ß
[1:09:10] ravensky93: oh yeah
[1:09:32] Molvonos: #justblizzardthings
[1:09:56] Mecabeast: they just need to turn legacy damage on for bfa swear
[1:11:00] DrkPhoenix6913: legecy damage might work for mythraxx, but it still wouldnt work for ghuun, needing to dunk the balls or whatever - still would need multiple people :P

[1:22:31] Respls: Ohhh man we going to get ragnoros 3.0??
[1:23:17] AUTiger0325: It's only upgradeable if  you do heroic raids or Mythic +11-15 though.  So what would it matter if they gave you 1/5 heroic.  It would be the same.
[1:23:31] mavericks312: apparently the trinket should heal you to max is what it is saying so maybe 3 qrtrs instead
[1:24:08] mavericks312: @AUTiger0325 11s arent that hard and are loaded with casuals atm
[1:24:49] AUTiger0325: @mavericks312 I'm not arguing that, I'm just saying what would it matter to give people heroic gear as catch up for alts and stuff?  That's more my point.

[1:36:44] sax0ny: Very much out of loop with wow retail, any gossip on what's next for it?
[1:36:50] tr4ncetv: cause twitch numbers determine a games success
[1:37:00] falldrgn: for the battle pass do you level it up by completing objectives on the battle pass? or just playing the  game.
[1:37:02] KingSlayerYotam: yea prob lots of console players

[1:38:37] Epiclurker27893: @sax0ny 10. drop is september 5
[1:39:01] raldrik: after level 70 you may get stronger but it doesnt have the flash of a POE or D3 endgame to watch
[1:40:30] smashwow: d4 very much didn't launch with a proper endgame considering normal expectations of arpgs.
[1:40:56] smashwow: and with tuning it would have been a shitshow. but it would have forced some hands too

[1:46:12] Mallaes: Go straight to the center Kappa
[1:46:17] Jarlan23: cant u run down the middle and blast the boss
[1:46:20] mikael_jansson90: no
[1:46:22] SAMBBA1: yeah cant solo it
[1:46:24] buffalodragn: It's a pain in the ass to do solo
[1:46:25] Mallaes: I don't know lol
[1:46:39] mikael_jansson90: u cant solo it
[1:46:45] SAMBBA1: what difficulty is this
[1:46:51] buffalodragn: I've gotten close to killing him solo on my warrior but he ends up kicking my ass each time
[1:47:14] mikael_jansson90: oh its lfr ;) mb then u can solo it
[1:47:28] RagingPunk: ajsDoc hmm 1 million dollars!
[1:47:43] smashwow: @tr4ncetv yes it has to start somewhere but if you're miles behind the competition you're only ever playing catchup. not a good setup for success, unless you have a very fast track to not lose the initial hype.
[1:48:08] Jarlan23: nah he doesnt play wow anymore
[1:48:17] Milanesa_De_Pollo: He hasn't played WoW in multiple weeks KEKW
[1:48:21] Myndjestyr: did asmongold inspire you to start streaming pal?
[1:48:24] mavericks312: lol asmon is a WoW tourist now
[1:48:36] botscast: hes a react andy now
[1:48:44] Jarlan23: dont think hes played dragonflighr really at all

[1:50:00] jkitchin75: @Myndjestyr  you what mate
[1:50:04] Myndjestyr: @mavericks312 ???
[1:50:07] boostedeg93: Are you doing mythic or heroic?

[1:50:22] smashwow: he was a top50 US right?
[1:50:25] Todmeister9000: wasn't that the last raid of SL
[1:50:35] mavericks312: asmon is a tourist these days
[1:50:37] warrenny: He didnt like effort i guess
[1:50:39] ohnot___her: Who is this?

[1:50:49] ohnot___her: Oh asmon
[1:50:52] dracullus: I remember he was trying to convince people trash is pointless and takes exactly same time as bosses when he was carried through Sepulcher xD

Game has been out for 2 months now, just have to give it time. Very few/if any live service games are going to have what people want on launch
[1:51:07] Rottencoarse: he was mad that he couldnt get carried during SL's last raid @Towelliee  :D
[1:51:13] abidetx: warrior mog EZ
[1:51:20] Jarlan23: my vaults gonna suck this week i didnt do any m+ just played baulders gate
[1:51:26] Jarlan23: think i did heroic but thats it
[1:51:41] Myndjestyr: wait but if towelliee started first why does asmon have so many viewers?
[1:51:49] xHukk: I switched it up this week from my normaly Ret/Prot pally game play and did some Hpal keys.  Was a good timel.

[1:53:07] mniezouu: casted by akunda when it reaches 100 energy
[1:53:13] Jarlan23: i think it might be thatur tanking them all together
[1:53:17] remlar__: i think it was a dispel
[1:53:19] Jarlan23: didnt u have to seperate them
[1:53:25] kyousuki21: Go to the wall beacons

[1:54:45] DrkPhoenix6913: the nonstop silence was the end of me :)
[1:55:29] dracullus: I hope this 10.1.7 quest for 415 boa token won't be 1 for account like Time Rift weekly
[1:55:29] Jarlan23: this was a good ass raid tho
[1:55:31] Jarlan23: i miss it
[1:56:07] Jarlan23: i want nathria to be soloable i never completed the mythic set and i really really want it
[1:56:10] Jarlan23: i love the plate from there
[1:56:18] Jarlan23: plate from here was really good too on mythic
[1:56:30] Nehcrom: We need the dual dagger war build :P
[1:56:39] Hebi2Cold: @Jarlan23 there are groups daily that clear mythic nathria
[1:56:47] Hebi2Cold: i run it myself every week
[1:56:47] Molvonos: That's how warriors should pvp - dual-wielding staffs to beatstick someone to death.
[1:57:19] Jarlan23: @Hebi2Cold yea maybe i should do that im just missing two pices

[1:59:54] Heero_Effect: Off topic question, how long does it take advanced to ship? I ordered there mushroom supplement and a hydrate blend on Friday. Excited to try them
[2:01:03] smashwow: @tr4ncetv agree to disagree. blizz both works for and against them. like i said if they iterate quickly they'll be fine. DF is a good example of a shining moment being missed because of past decisions and slow response.
[2:01:24] Heero_Effect: Ah cool cool
[2:01:26] Rottencoarse: oh snap
[2:01:27] Rottencoarse: :D
[2:01:33] Mostdangspy: @Heero_Effect I ordered those and it took almost a month for them to ship them. I guess they were out. I emailed them and they emailed me back right away
[2:01:50] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u gonna check D4 after the patch today?

[2:03:32] kyousuki21: Seems like a warrior and all melee classes in new games.
[2:03:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Are all BFA raids ungabungable now or only the LFR versions?
[2:03:53] mewkittymon: I think he did
[2:03:59] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  basically you use shadow and cold imbuement and use Barrage as your main spender.
[2:04:19] Day_Walker78: i am enjoing my WW barb blasting tier 35 NM dungons at lvl 75 and the enmies are like lvl  85+ and goes so fast

[2:09:35] Jarlan23: instead of actually fithing them
[2:09:36] smashwow: nah dev's won't even call auggie support. it's still a dps class in their eyes
[2:09:38] Autoexeq: Enhancement should have a support part of their tree
[2:09:41] AUTiger0325: With how much of a headache Augmentation has been so far, they may be over it already.
[2:09:45] Jarlan23: fighting*
[2:09:50] snake_like: saw someone say it best: if it's not thematic to a new expansion it ain't becoming a new class
[2:10:07] Ovium56: boat boss was easy, just did it this morning
[2:10:19] Jarlan23: support class is a really good idea i hope they keep it
[2:10:21] Jarlan23: but just tune it
[2:10:51] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Or add support role for groups like in RIFT:Planes of Telara
[2:10:54] ArcaneMaki: Amen!
[2:10:56] alluza: caster range tank
[2:10:58] Ovium56: yeah easy
[2:10:59] AUTiger0325: Nothing wrong with admitting the tuning is just too hard
[2:11:00] Contendedlemon: evoker tank spec was literally handed on a golden platter for them to make
[2:11:02] Heero_Effect: Lil Wayne is the new the host on undisputed‚Ä¶the heck
[2:11:18] NickLeonhearth: one time, one time a new class does not have a tank spec, and we wont stop hearing about it :
[2:11:28] Rottencoarse: @Heero_Effect  wait what for real? :D
[2:11:34] weallcrazy: or thaye might make a demon hunter spec that is ranged towPog  lol
[2:11:37] Rottencoarse: didnt he do the music for undisputed again?

[2:12:35] snake_like: the person who designed legion/bfa weapons works for riot now. big sad
[2:13:07] noway137: did they make the legendary system being random drops?
[2:13:10] Rottencoarse: @Heero_Effect  i saw that he did the intro music for undisputed again not being a host
[2:13:14] Rottencoarse: that's WEIRD
[2:13:31] smashwow: they do now or did? there was a mass exodus of wow devs from riot a month-ish ago

[2:40:33] lumaday: twilight dev gotta make another appearance in a future patch
[2:40:36] Jarlan23: mechagon was hella fun especially at the start
[2:40:41] Jarlan23: before we had flying and everyone used jet packs
[2:41:09] im_n0t_jezus: time something
[2:41:13] im_n0t_jezus: temporal something
[2:41:13] Carahail: those jetpacks were fun kinda miss them
[2:41:18] Sediz: imo would been cool if they made smt with the bronze dragon theme, entering an old raid
[2:41:29] Srgskug: none
[2:41:31] DunzoCD: there was no S tier
[2:41:57] JerBoody: I try to respect people‚Äôs opinions but any time I hear ‚Äúbfa bad‚Äù I just think it‚Äôs sheeple parroting Asmongold
[2:42:00] Lintgamer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt4Rk1X3TGE

[2:42:08] zlinkly: zlinkly subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[2:42:11] JerBoody: It was a really good expansion
[2:42:16] im_n0t_jezus: sounds pretentious
[2:42:22] Jarlan23: @JerBoody nah bfa was bad it had too  many systems
[2:42:26] Jarlan23: felt like a chore
[2:42:30] Lintgamer: https://youtu.be/Dt4Rk1X3TGE?t=3597
[2:42:31] TheItalianStallion321: BfA was bad lol until we got corruption

[2:43:07] JerBoody: Ok asmongold
[2:43:08] lumaday: jailer i think
[2:43:12] Sediz: I liked BFA alot, just that I got super busy for most part of it when Classic came out!
[2:43:14] Srgskug: last patch of sl was eternitys end
[2:43:14] DunzoCD: zerith mortis
[2:43:27] zysmos: KEKW
[2:43:39] Karn1987: gooday @Towelliee mods
[2:43:45] lumaday: Free cov swapping and zerith mortis
[2:43:46] Autoexeq: But I mean he put 8.2 highest
[2:43:46] DunzoCD: this list is all over the place
[2:43:51] pavepawns: is this ranking patches?
[2:43:54] botscast: watch the video and u will understand
[2:43:57] lumaday: 9.1 was chains
[2:44:04] TheItalianStallion321: yes he was ranking patches
[2:44:10] TheItalianStallion321: not whole expansions
[2:44:10] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:44:23] Valearleen: but ranking what? the raids?
[2:44:31] Autoexeq: Just watch his reasoning behind one of them
[2:44:32] smashwow: wait what was F tier?
[2:44:38] TheItalianStallion321: was 8.2 corruption?
[2:44:43] mavericks312: that man was smoking crack before that video
[2:44:51] botscast: ranking patches, not raids specifically
[2:44:51] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[2:44:54] smashwow: 8.2 was essences i think
[2:44:56] Jarlan23: 8.3 was corruption
[2:44:58] Thoreya: 8.2 was essences, 8.3 was corruption
[2:45:00] DunzoCD: @TheItalianStallion321 8.2 was nazjatar/mechagon and azshara
[2:45:00] smashwow: or mechagon
[2:45:03] smashwow: one of the 2
[2:45:07] BiggTC: 8.2 was Nazjatar and Mechgon
[2:45:07] QuigsTV: @Towelliee ngl i liked this boss
[2:45:12] Valearleen: so ranking patch in general and Legion is C tier? ok
[2:45:13] TheItalianStallion321: ah thats right
[2:45:29] Thoreya: essences was prob the best progression thing theyve made in recent expacs cant lie LUL
[2:45:40] Karn1987: cant solo court @Towelliee
[2:45:47] Jarlan23: it would have been if it was account wide
[2:46:17] TheItalianStallion321: corruption was the best
[2:46:23] TheItalianStallion321: rank 5 twilight dev
[2:46:24] ArcaneMaki: Different strokes for different folks
[2:46:29] smashwow: concept-wise essences were good. acquiring essences not so fun
[2:46:29] buffalodragn: I liked how the corruption had the shadow priest like effect
[2:46:29] TheItalianStallion321: 270% ineff truth on a HPAL
[2:46:30] JerBoody: I mean legion was one of the best expansions even though artifact powers and legendary rng made Alts miserable to play and off specs unplayable in 7.0
[2:46:34] QuigsTV: @Towelliee Trigger Warning! I miss AP farming and I enjoyed it a lot.
[2:46:35] figgy640: As someone who couldn't take the grind anymore is why I left after first raid tier in bfa/shadowlands.
[2:46:38] Jarlan23: yea but essences had such a long fucking grind
[2:46:43] Autoexeq: Yes on both fronts. They were all amazing systems but it was too much for  non-no-lifers
[2:46:54] Todmeister9000: I miss borrowed power
[2:46:55] clambynature: I think a 2:3 ratio for rewards would be casul
[2:47:01] pavepawns: i didnt like azerite armor too much cause it felt like they wanted to expand it further but werent able to
[2:47:02] marineboi1288: I think the gear upgrade system is amazing
[2:47:06] Jarlan23: they made it just impossible to play alts in bfa
[2:47:10] DunzoCD: idk how he had 10.0 at B tier and 10.1 at C tier
[2:47:11] pavepawns: but i did love bfa overall tho
[2:47:18] notdustinx: The only people quitting are pvpers
[2:47:22] Jarlan23: bish never dropped my trinket
[2:47:32] ArcaneMaki: When there were no other games around it was easy to sell the grind.
[2:47:33] NordoTv: You're about to get the tanking trinket
[2:47:40] TheItalianStallion321: i personally miss waking up every day grinding AP
[2:47:43] TheItalianStallion321: but its cool
[2:47:48] TheItalianStallion321: gives me more time to play another game i guess
[2:47:55] DunzoCD: 10.1 has been one of the best alt gearing patches ever, should definitely be above C tier
[2:48:07] aikopooh: speaking of casual ff14 free trial now lasts till stormblood which is good yea yea
[2:48:10] QuigsTV: @Towelliee Like I said in this chat before. Id love this season's gearing if all crests were account wide.
[2:48:22] JerBoody: Account wide is fun but if they let it get to the point where playing your main is the best way to gear Alts I don‚Äôt think is good for the game
[2:48:36] mavericks312: but those grinds make players feel forced to play the game everyday
[2:48:38] zysmos: they should have made these grinds account wide
[2:48:47] tonyr23: I loves the legion class weapon legendary
[2:48:53] noway137: that's why osrs is my favourite osrs
[2:48:58] TheItalianStallion321: @mavericks312 thats what i loved lol
[2:48:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are walls now, yes
[2:49:00] TheItalianStallion321: force me
[2:49:15] Thoreya: love DF to death but would not mind a progression system like essences at all if it was a lil more lenient
[2:49:23] Jarlan23: they could add a paragon system i guess i wouldnt be against that. but again it needs to be account wide. i do not want to feel like i have to grind anything on alts.
[2:49:25] Thoreya: idk if thats a hot take to have in an mmo but
[2:49:27] mavericks312: @TheItalianStallion321 nah to many other games to play then to be stuck on one everyday
[2:49:38] smashwow: summarized: coke isn't for everyone
[2:49:45] ArcaneMaki: Some people don't have the time, but feel like they should invest the time to grind, and it can be bad in the end.
[2:49:47] TheItalianStallion321: @mavericks312 but thats your choice. you either grind, or you dont
[2:50:06] Boinkywalrus: did they make bfa raids soloable now?
[2:50:10] TheItalianStallion321: @mavericks312 not disagreeing with you but its a choice you must make. grind every day for an hour or 2 or dont
[2:50:14] Contendedlemon: the amount of people that fell off in this boss was too much
[2:50:19] TheItalianStallion321: this is how I FEEL. this is not a fact,
[2:50:23] QuigsTV: @Towelliee IMO the problem with not having AP grinds, is it makes me bored when im on and not doing any M+ or raids. I do completely understand why it was removed tho.
[2:50:30] DunzoCD: this was a hilarious boss in LFR
[2:50:57] mavericks312: @TheItalianStallion321 your not wrong but its also not a suprise an xpac where players dont have to log in everyday has the most sub rentention and will go down as top 3

[2:52:07] Jarlan23: ff14 built their main story around doing the raids which i think is a very good idea
[2:52:08] TheItalianStallion321: my friend in FF14 does his reclears on Tuesday and hes done for the week
[2:52:12] Jarlan23: but its not something WoW can pull off
[2:52:30] Myndjestyr: i thought they dont share sub numbers anymore
[2:52:45] TheItalianStallion321: they cant pull it off anymore. a lot of people now a days would bitch about the grind
[2:52:52] CeruleanStar: i'm one of the target people for this... i usually unsub after the x.0 tier/patch/season ... now i'm looking at the 10.2 patch with anticipation
[2:52:55] TheItalianStallion321: only the THDs of the world would be in awe

[2:53:19] Jarlan23: you can literally level and gear an alt to 440 in less than a week
[2:53:21] figgy640: I like being able to quickly do my things for the week and have time for other games. Past wow felt like a second job
[2:53:22] Jarlan23: if ur dedicated
[2:53:28] Jarlan23: the crafting system helps a lot
[2:53:32] wakeandbacon95: way finder POGGERS
[2:53:47] TheItalianStallion321: @Jarlan23 and i think that is another great part of this expansion.
[2:53:58] TheItalianStallion321: you dont need weeks and weeks to gear up an alt
[2:54:02] TobziJD: TobziJD subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! :)
[2:54:10] Jarlan23: yup. i love the crafting systme
[2:54:11] JerBoody: Also helps when you can level an alt and jump into actual end game content that you actually want to do without a bunch of weekly chores

[2:54:22] dasbrewski: I got a young kid and I can actually play whatever time I have and get gear. I can actually raid and have fun
[2:54:23] DunzoCD: people also used to play the launch and take the X.1 patch off to wait til they added flying to come back, them having dragonriding from the start was huge as well to keep people
[2:54:24] CeruleanStar: with current wow philosophy i wont' unsub, i can play BG3, D4, starfield, jedi, zelda and still come back and keep up
[2:54:28] TheItalianStallion321: ok boys, this boss will take a LONG time
[2:54:31] zysmos: yeah you can't solo as a warrior i think
[2:54:34] Contendedlemon: now all they need to do is make crests account wide and im happy
[2:55:05] wildwittra: we need improvements on how work orders can be advertized and interacted with. now we are screaming into darkness looking for crafters
[2:55:06] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I will say the profession revamp alone is enough to put this expac high on the list.
[2:55:08] TheItalianStallion321: yeah, crests BoA has to be next
[2:55:10] TheItalianStallion321: has to be
[2:55:35] mavericks312: i just finished ToTk man that game is walking with goty
[2:56:00] Jarlan23: as long as i dont get burnt out ill stay subbed
[2:56:17] TheItalianStallion321: i just did Glory of the Aberrus Raider last night man some of those achievements were annoying as fuck
[2:56:20] Jarlan23: i havent gotten burnt out on df yet and ive played DF way  more than i did shadowlands
[2:56:22] Milanesa_De_Pollo: f2p announcement in Blizzcon?

[2:57:56] Jarlan23: then ill probably quit again
[2:58:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: and has something to do with the ninja turtles
[2:58:02] RoboMaximillion: that won't come until later fanfests
[2:58:03] Molvonos: Oh, that boss has unique shoulder transmog
[2:58:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: If they add trader's tender in store, I wouldn't be surprised.

[2:58:49] TheItalianStallion321: @HaxzorJimDuggan my friend had a theory on that but i forgot that was it. Turtle may be a new race
[2:58:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Jarlan23 no yoshi-p wore a TMNT shirt as a hint, we find out more at london fanfest in october most likely

[3:02:04] TheItalianStallion321: from what i remember
[3:02:28] JerBoody: I think this fight was blizzards attempt to outsmart the weak aura writers but they failed
[3:02:40] darkdestroz: I do wonder if King Towelliee is gonna Remain a potato XD
[3:02:42] PadidinJones: I WAS THERE!

[3:07:35] PastelDeNata69: @Jarlan23 They will announce OW3 and nothing will carry over
[3:07:39] ElDrakenMan: I feel like dragonflight was announced like a year ago or maybe time is a crazy concept
[3:07:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: 2 weeks before Blizzcon could work, but I don't know if it would be ready
[3:07:48] KinggKebab: They'd need to give people goin to blizzcon time to travel to RWF venues too, makes more sense for them to wait till after blizzcon
[3:07:59] N3llee: really think its going to be a wow xpac? I figured that would be next year and this year is all about the new survival IP
[3:08:04] Nerendis: It released a year ago my guy @eldrakenman
[3:08:07] TheItalianStallion321: new expansion...we're going BACK TO KALIMDOR lets do it!
[3:08:09] smashwow: best 10.2 line up would probably be nov 7th right?
[3:08:10] TheItalianStallion321: redo molten core
[3:08:43] Nerendis: There is ALWAYS an expac announcement the year AFTER an expac has released. My guys. This has been the way for over a decade.
[3:08:50] TheItalianStallion321: i want to see raids again where you take 3 days to kill trash
[3:08:54] Zettabyte: Everything get better with bacon!!
[3:08:54] TheItalianStallion321: and have 15 bosses

[3:09:23] cipusanx: story aint that good anyway
[3:09:32] michaelmm: @ElDrakenMan It was but with no Blizzcon the wow team could choose when to announce. With Blizzcon back they don't get that choice any more.
[3:09:48] Nokterian: KEKW
[3:09:54] redstrumpf: bfa campaign > df&sl
[3:09:54] buffalodragn: LUL
[3:10:06] cipusanx: i think its bad. we got a dragon expansion where a dragon gives you a quest to save little toads and beat bigger bully toads...
[3:10:25] Molvonos: @cipusanx The fuck?  Did you only do like, one quest?
[3:10:26] Zettabyte: Imagine Kotick having a farewell speech at BlizzCon towCopium
[3:10:28] Jarlan23: havent they been encrypting a lot of cut scenes to reduce story spoilers
[3:11:10] buffalodragn: @cipusanx the fuck you going on about
[3:11:14] michaelmm: The patch will be announced and on the PTR well before release - we'll know the major themes pre Blizzcon.
[3:11:25] cipusanx: did 99% of the quests actually but that one stick with me. this expansion lacks the warcraft feeling
[3:11:25] Jarlan23: christ metzen is gonna be at blizzcon aint he
[3:11:27] JerBoody: The servers up already?
[3:11:29] Jarlan23: think i heard that somewhere

[3:25:18] khrovaa: OMG jury duty is so good
[3:25:27] Nerendis: I love when they call me for jury duty. I tell them I'm a lawyer and they tell me to GTFO.

[3:26:34] mavericks312: Isn‚Äôt that the show with cyclops in it
[3:26:39] Nerendis: I've done Voir Dire before (jury selection). It fucking sucks. The opposing attorney always excuses they jurors I want.
[3:26:50] veryhairyheyyall: LOL
[3:26:53] DunzoCD: KEKW
[3:26:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Isn't that an easy way to get out of jury duty
[3:27:15] polaropposite76: James Mardsen
[3:27:17] Nerendis: It's pretty obvious when a potential juror is lying.
[3:27:23] Jarlan23: yeah that dude that played superman?

[3:28:54] Nerendis: You are under oath during Voir Dire
[3:29:00] Mr_Junt: Not while answering selection questions?
[3:29:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: The judge swears them in after the jury is formed

[3:30:30] Nerendis: Jurors are sworn in before selection, just FYI. They take a second oath when court commences after selection.

[3:31:02] Nerendis: We have a whole list of flags depending on what our case is
[3:31:08] GodKingMuninn: makes sense not like the court can force a boss to pay you lol
[3:31:12] 07biby: i got off easy from jury duty... the accused didnt want a jury :P

[3:32:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think people get paid for being on the jury, but it's not a lot
[3:32:38] Viysol: My employer covers 30 days paid for jury duty per year, but the government gives you like 30$
[3:32:40] firehawk73: they compensate you, but not enough
[3:32:43] EasilyZeroed: Wonder when our next stat squish will be

[3:33:02] Mecabeast: yeah its basically lunch money
[3:33:10] Jarlan23: pretty sure minnesota pays you minimum wage and pays for lunch
[3:33:21] Heero_Effect: No I mean don‚Äôt, if you work in a job we have jury duty leave, so I still get paid my salary just like PTO
[3:33:29] byrdeen45: most jobs pay you for  jury duty
[3:33:32] 07biby: its ur duty as a citizen so, u dont get paid, u get fed
[3:33:40] Nerendis: Each jurisdiction can set their own compensation. In fact each jurisdiction can set their own specific judicial rules so long as it complies with state/federal ones.

[5:39:05] Nerendis: @Kingconn223 Well until this AM it was beyond S+ tier. We will see after this patch. But I'm sure it's still pumping.
[5:39:42] kristinnkari: what is black hole?
[5:40:05] Nerendis: Aug was def hit
[5:40:07] Molvonos: lol
[5:40:08] Kingconn223: @Nerendis oh gotcha, i just did not know what the meta was right now. I used to main mage and DK for a while so i wasnt sure.
[5:40:11] Molvonos: They only nerfed two abilities.
[5:40:14] darkkilla1: aug evoker nerfs are just a slight tickly
[5:40:16] Molvonos: And they're ones on long cooldowns.
[5:40:26] Molvonos: So it's only a small nerf.
[5:40:37] darkkilla1: mirror is not on a long cooldown
[5:40:41] Nerendis: @Kingconn223 You'll be fine. Just won't be pumping as hard as last week
[5:40:49] abracka_: probably stuff like paladin bubble no hearth/etc
[5:40:57] Karn1987: a massiv gravity well in space made by a star collapsing

[5:48:09] Frenaris: I think now that i'm older I can't spend the time that BG3 requires
[5:48:32] Finesty: Yeah I can't do JRPG's. That turn based combat got old for me a long time ago.
[5:48:52] mikejames01: I love BG3 but it will take me 6 months or longer to get the game done cause I am slow at it lolol
[5:48:55] Molvonos: I have a low tolerance for gatekeeping, lol.  And i've been playing RPGs since Final Fantasy on the Nintendo and D&D since 2nd Ed.
[5:49:01] Calibearr: baldurs gate isnt my style of game either by any means
[5:49:22] Dcarter: Gatekeeping is very weird
[5:49:22] bravebent: Nah, RPGs can be very different. BG3 is very slow and very big on exhaustive exploration. It‚Äôs still good don‚Äôt get me wrong.

[6:31:10] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee  don't remember the last time i had so much fun because i had so many geared chars
[6:31:11] Nerendis: Dragonflight should be the standard, I agree.

[6:32:05] Nerendis: @Rudric_Ice I think it's more the packaging of your opinions than the having them.
[6:32:32] darkkilla1: to be fair spriest dps is not overly high its their utility that makes them op
[6:32:44] Qassian: nightmare dungeons feel a lot better with the increased density
[6:32:47] Daniel_Drago: Shadow still wanted for all of the utility... all they're doing is nerfing damage when really we have so many things we bring to the table
