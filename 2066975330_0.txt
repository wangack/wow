[3:19:13] canaryofc: how much gold have you made?
[3:19:37] pkprell: How much is profit? If you flip the grime-encrusted etc

[3:21:26] champagnepapi39: 10 stam, only scary part is that stv ring is equal SP.. so
[3:21:37] pkprell: Think its worth it, you'll run both stv + underworld for bis
[3:21:57] champagnepapi39: im just scared they make a ring at 50 with same stats
[3:22:00] pkprell: And most likely only gonna be +1 ring at 50 so, one of them is gonna continue being BIS
[3:22:31] ATLien26: that shit gonna tank when gnomer on 3day
[3:23:22] coastindd: is there any easy ways i can do at least like 30 g/h having no professions etc

[7:07:42] Heartofc: the game is fine imo
[7:08:03] maxwellnxm: alright turning off the stream
[7:08:08] forkbomb2: depends on how good pvp events / things with replay value are
[7:08:12] IllusoryResponse: That's the cycle
[7:08:38] DekaTwitch: retail hype is over...nobody is playing retail
[7:09:03] DekaTwitch: watching and playing is not the same

[7:10:23] DekaTwitch: monkaS
[7:10:23] RayMaster2323: sod has 6million logs and retail has 5 million on warcraftlogs, so its kinda the same
[7:10:24] fl_am: how is it dead
[7:10:25] Jonathan_4567: sad to see swifty with 300 viewres tbh
[7:10:26] Totterhovna: @Frostfist1 not anymore after classic release
[7:10:28] DekaTwitch: STOP monkaS
[7:10:29] c0rnholio420: LUL

[7:12:46] Bpobelle: classic is bis
[7:12:51] c0rnholio420: any trailer of gameplay out?
[7:12:54] Traihart: @Lmgd1 it went too bad after legion LUL but people say Dragonblight is kinda alright, but people still dont play it
[7:13:20] Traihart: Because no faith in blizzard,I'd guess
[7:13:37] bojji900: legion was good tho
[7:13:47] Traihart: Yeah, legion was a blast
[7:13:48] Phahman: Dota KEKG
[7:14:03] forkbomb2: TBH retail kinda boring, classic was more fun with world boss / scarab lord battles / drama
[7:14:12] lovelovelotsoflove: Highest 3k? KEKInsane
[7:14:29] forkbomb2: yea :(
[7:14:57] bojji900: there is no drama in sod thats whats missing KEKW
[7:15:03] forkbomb2: wow with eve online endgame would be amazing with player owned territory apes would be built for that
[7:15:29] Traihart: @Lmgd1 is Tidal charm still disabled?
[7:15:30] TrebekTv: servers have no community man there way to big it feels like 4 servers in one
[7:15:39] TrebekTv: you hardly run into the same people evere
[7:15:58] Totterhovna: dont think current apes can compete with beef ngl
[7:16:02] bojji900: layers just warps the game so hard
[7:16:04] TrebekTv: crusader strike us feels like that anyways
[7:17:31] Heartofc: its sod, dad gamers can get 99s easy anyways

[7:19:35] TrebekTv: glad i got to enjoy 2019
[7:19:36] DekaTwitch: thats true
[7:19:36] radassbadass69: the goal of the game is to get raid gear to dominate pvp
[7:20:13] forkbomb2: dream would be wow with a pvp endgame like albion / BDO but im just on copium dont think blizzard would ever do that
[7:20:40] DekaTwitch: get 99 parse in retail mythic raid. but classic? kek
[7:21:09] Heartofc: WutFace
[7:21:16] bsodding: PogO

[7:21:25] c0rnholio420: parsegodx
[7:21:27] bojji900: they want to be on warcraftlogs site so they can see their name
[7:21:30] Heartofc: im trying to sleep here, keep it down lmgd
[7:21:43] DekaTwitch: in retail its good to look at. but classic nope
[7:21:52] Hawiii: yeah but pvp as no sense now with runes and gear we can have is just about who gonna one tap first LUL . for me sod is clear t he raid with friends get gold kill people on your spot make reroll that's it

[7:22:09] Heartofc: @Hawiii BASED
[7:22:10] bojji900: yeah retail  is different cuz parsing is actually good and can be mechanically hard there
[7:22:35] c0rnholio420: definitly gonna pirate that movie

[7:22:38] Hawiii: i don't care true no one care its easy asf anyway LUL

[7:26:28] outofmanax: Competing against dads literally
[7:26:56] bojji900: i had a friend who is abit of a noob who quit cuz of parsers. problem is it overlaps tryharders  with noobs.
[7:27:04] Phahman: So youre saying if certain people dont compete its not a competition? ICANT
[7:27:50] lovelovelotsoflove: How much for hotw on ur server
[7:28:29] bsodding: let them have fun PogO
[7:28:40] Dtrux_: Heaaler parses are meta
[7:28:43] bojji900: u think parsing will be bigger at 60?
[7:28:46] Monkeynews: Its a bad take
[7:29:12] TrebekTv: We are just view bots
[7:29:19] TrebekTv: botting views
[7:29:32] c0rnholio420: someone check lmxx parse
[7:29:59] Monkeynews: I did 6 raids per lockout p1 bfd. 3 with ppl that are passionate about parse. 3 with ppl that complain about parse. Guess which raids were more fun/smooth
[7:30:26] Heartofc: KEKShook @Lmgd1
[7:30:46] bojji900: well yeah u have to have everyone on the same boat or the boat sinks KEKW
[7:30:59] outofmanax: Did noone read what mn said? lol
[7:31:21] Monkeynews: Yes kinda lmgd
[7:31:35] forkbomb2: a lot of guilds had the same problem.  half the guild cares about pvp other half wants to parse
[7:32:24] aSteamedTomato: @bojji900 That sentence makes absolutely no sense in isolation
[7:32:28] Monkeynews: Worthlesd
[7:32:32] cyabrotv: AH
[7:32:48] cyabrotv: I got 15 g for that belt earlier today
[7:32:55] bojji900: @aSteamedTomato KEKG
[7:32:57] Monkeynews: Screenshot
[7:34:19] blackenned: @Lmgd1 you gonna play hardcore self found when it releases?
[7:34:23] cyabrotv: how much do heart of wild go for on horde
[7:35:11] IllusoryResponse: That's fair
[7:35:15] bojji900: BASED
[7:35:15] ama__deus: HC SSF comes out at the worst time. Doubt it'll draw a crowd
[7:35:19] aSteamedTomato: I mean, that's a job if ever I heard of one
[7:35:24] c0rnholio420: mans gotta eat
[7:35:25] Synhra: What are you farming
[7:35:29] bojji900: ashes of creation will save us
[7:35:33] endful__: It’s a bit, but WoW won’t die anytime soon so consider that
[7:35:35] blackenned: yeah hc sf will be a 24/7 grind..
[7:36:01] Synhra: dadada
[7:36:11] aSteamedTomato: yeah, makes sense
[7:36:32] blackenned: yeah when hc released i just got my rogue to 60 and stopped, could be bothered with the raids again
[7:36:40] bojji900: @forkbomb2 actually true KEKW
[7:39:38] lovelovelotsoflove: KEKBye

[7:40:34] brandvarmbums: how much is heart of the wild on ur server?
[7:40:58] bojji900: sunken temple raid or BRD raid phase 3?
[7:41:27] bojji900: maraudon raid then?
[7:41:28] cyabrotv: I hope it’s brd
[7:41:33] ama__deus: Might be better as a raid than it was as a dungeon, but I didn't mind it that much
[7:41:36] cyabrotv: Mara to low
[7:41:55] ama__deus: @stoprelax BRD too good a dungeon for them to touch that
[7:42:02] aSteamedTomato: I've always loved ST. But even if you hate it, you should hope it's ST and not BRD. Because BRD is a great dungeon. If you get BRD raid, you also get ST dungeon
[7:42:12] aSteamedTomato: if you get ST raid you don't get ST dungeon, and you still have BRD raid
[7:42:17] aSteamedTomato: BRD dungeon*
[7:42:26] ama__deus: Something new at 60 would be so much hype, though
[7:42:32] bojji900: that would be sick
[7:42:40] irevxngee: that would be way too good to be true
[7:43:02] Synhra: to much for a indi company
[7:43:09] Talgarx: IS ele dog?
[7:43:19] ama__deus: Probably can be counted as extremely successful beta test
