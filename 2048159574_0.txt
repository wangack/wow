[0:09:11] Kalakbar: good, god damn I'm addicted
[0:09:21] zachgamegodx: so when ur 4 set procs echos on ppl, those reversioons all have a 15% chance to give u an essence burst
[0:09:25] Kalakbar: a bad case of new MMOnia
[0:09:27] zachgamegodx: so it kinda increases the essence burst count
[0:09:41] tv_raz: idk why you would play anything but arcane
[0:09:51] Tyferious: I saw the GDKP thing
[0:09:52] Kalakbar: currently fishing on the open ocean and gunning down people sneaking trade packs past me
[0:10:00] tea_berri: will you try throne and lib
[0:10:04] heymomimonttv: oh so gdkp only banned in SOD lol not classic or retail
[0:11:54] Aro725: I do and I dont. Like they omega nerfed hunter pets and runes and stuff and they wouldve done it pre launch if there was ptr. But the discovery is nice

[0:14:47] skez_live: As someone who enjoys retail more right now, it does tempt me again to try this next phase of SoD as they add stuff
[0:15:09] skez_live: I wonder how many classic andys will also enjoy these additions and be tempted to retail again
[0:15:25] Badasti: runes... are they recycling old shit instead of adding new talents or smth again? >.>
[0:15:52] Badasti: ohhh classic wow stuff i guess
[0:15:54] Magottx: “Adding 2v2 and 3v3 arena at max lvl” plz

[0:18:47] Magottx: Are you genuinely getting the vibe they may add arena at max tho? I can feel it
[0:20:07] Aro725: KEKW but how do they police it

[0:20:40] Xeliumimar: how can they restrict it LOL
[0:21:00] Renethadox: Bi
[0:21:02] Renethadox: Hii
[0:21:02] hulkdieselx: GDKPs are terrible for that game and gold buying. PERMA them all
[0:21:04] therealzugzugzugs: pube crawl cube crawll whats the difference
[0:21:04] Renethadox: Yooii
[0:21:08] Aro725: i wouldnt mind gdkps at all if everyone didnt just buy gold
[0:21:21] Badasti: i think they should use minimal automation... part of playing the game should include social aspects and organisation
[0:21:30] awwyaaaa: what is GDKP?
[0:21:33] Saiyori: yeah, the buying gold is the issue i have with it
[0:21:41] Roundhere_: im glad they will be gone
[0:21:47] martinuslol: GDKP is horrible because you have to spend money to actually get gear, at least looking at the prices from wotlk
[0:21:50] kreyzy8: I can't wait for all the underground GDKP's, they are just going to advertise under a new name LUL
[0:22:13] kreyzy8: its going to be like any other illegal activity
[0:22:27] souz3l: As a casual player I hate GDKP
[0:22:41] NozakGaming: I geared through normal raids then became a carry for gdkp's. its the best way to make money for an spriest.
[0:22:43] Xeliumimar: the no more GDKP reddit thread blew up lol
[0:22:58] Tiebot87: @venruki sub rogues really feelin nerfs? Outlaw gonna takeover the AWC?
[0:23:16] Badasti: Im prob going to annoy some people but I think wow isn't a good game for casual play - there's much better stuff to jump in and out of without changing the game
[0:23:35] martinuslol: Yeah it's a brilliant system if it wasn't for gold buying. And then people would have a reason to farm gold. Farming gold used to be fun in a way
[0:23:41] Ronn_Deezy: it just pumps consistent dam the whole game
[0:23:42] froztitv: frost mage and mm hunt good in 3s as comb ?in retail
[0:23:45] hollow1zed: they are just overtuned but you just lose over time instead of being deleted so ppl dont cry as much about it
[0:23:46] skez_live: @Badasti SoD for sure, but retail is much easier
[0:24:13] Tiebot87: @venruki heard someone say.. If ur class is "BOTABLE" its a terribly designed class thoughts on that ?
[0:24:14] Deeblain: Yep gdkp is awesome. Gold buying is the problem.
[0:24:18] Xeliumimar: chunli and wealthyman have entered the chat
[0:24:25] Zenfuzz: any predictions on AWC sleeper comps?
[0:24:30] betasoldier: What do you think is Devoker's best comp in 3's?
[0:24:34] Badasti: @skez_live I prefer retail but I've always thought it should follow the same philosophy.
[0:24:43] Magottx: Do you think there’s a possibility they add arena to SoD? It’s the only way I wanna risk puttin time into it
[0:24:46] Nolavvi: Sorry from a complete newb, what is "GDKP" ?
[0:24:47] heymomimonttv: how do you redesign ele shaman to make it not bottable?
[0:25:05] hollow1zed: ele shaman is easier to play than any other melee and you can quote me on that LUL
[0:25:05] leeka: I think they said no to that already
[0:25:08] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:25:09] possibly_dave: !drops
[0:25:09] Nightbot: VENRUKI has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the rewards! Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[0:25:12] heymomimonttv: ele bots have been making me enjoy my ele less lol
[0:25:36] lfkappachupa: how are the q as healer
[0:25:37] kreyzy8: sod seems way more focused on world pvp content
[0:25:43] kreyzy8: so I doubt they ever add arenas
[0:25:50] Geowind: my holy pally is lvl 27 lol : )
[0:25:51] ItsBees: @Nolavvi You basically bid on raid drops with gold
[0:25:54] therealzugzugzugs: Kreygasm
[0:25:58] malvarcla: theres also a fistweaver bot going around rn @venruki
[0:26:00] skez_live: I actually wonder what the lifecycle of SoD is going to be, like do they plan to run it for a year or two?
[0:26:03] betasoldier: @venruki What do you think the best 3's comp is for Devoker right now?
[0:26:05] therealzugzugzugs: g shit
[0:26:16] jaymaxs: why do so many bots choose ele?
[0:26:17] Nolavvi: @ItsBees Ah alright, thanks
[0:26:21] jaymaxs: why not boomkin
[0:26:25] jaymaxs: or mage or osmethign
[0:26:27] Lythi: the biggest annoyance with ele hoenstly is the lack of counterplay to their damage. dispell on an 8 sec CD and flameshock on 2 targets every 6 seconds jakbTHINK
[0:26:27] Xeliumimar: to late clipped out of context!
[0:26:33] froztitv: SOD have alot of bots :(
[0:26:45] Fixit_cat: Bots and pants and bots and pants
[0:26:52] Zenfuzz: any prediction on any sleeper comps in AWC?
[0:27:05] kreyzy8: earlier today Chan fought a dev evoker that was disengrating his teammate, insta spun 180 to kick his fear in 0.001 seconds, and immediately spun back around again LUL
[0:27:18] Cafe0le: ^^ i saw it KEKW
[0:27:19] gaulois62: would love to paly ele but thats a huge turn off for me..
[0:27:28] jaymaxs: ahh okay makes sense i guess kinda sucks though since i like ele a lot it looks so cool when you spam out machine gun lava
[0:27:34] kreyzy8: it was before the fear cast bar even appeared
[0:27:42] nikthevoker: do you have clip
[0:27:43] kreyzy8: no it extremely obvious
[0:27:55] kreyzy8: I may have to clip, let me see
[0:27:56] nikthevoker: @kreyzy8 ive done shit like that by accident before lUL
[0:27:57] kh9911: guys is Hpally fun to play?
[0:27:59] zachgamegodx: ngl evokers always look sus bc the rig is super stiff
[0:28:12] nightmxz: Should I make a weakaura that gives you priority for healing spells to press on hpal so you always know the right button? That's not botting right
[0:28:17] sixthycent: i like hpal and its more fun since druids were nerfed a tad
[0:28:18] zachgamegodx: ven sometimes says that an evoker will look like a robot and its true
[0:28:22] crooked_paw: is there a list of addons/wa's that ven uses??
[0:28:24] Magottx: I sometimes miss what I was tryna kick and accidentally insta kick whatever they’re about to cast
[0:28:40] nikthevoker: @nightmxz theres been multiplle addons like that in pve since forever MOP atleast
[0:28:57] kreyzy8: https://www.twitch.tv/chanx/clip/AmericanClumsyHamGingerPower-enexGu5kBo33wjvO?filter=clips&range=24hr&sort=time
[0:28:58] nikthevoker: it just pops up on screen of what to press in prio list
[0:28:59] kreyzy8: this is the clip LOL
[0:29:09] nightmxz: @nikthevoker Yeah but not conditionals in pvp that also check for interrupts
[0:29:11] Darthrando: If I'm watching wow content, I'
[0:29:18] gaulois62: @venruki  whats your current graphic card?
[0:29:21] Darthrando: 'm watching Venruki
[0:29:21] Saitistreamy: in march is the mid season S3 AWC cup, what do you think that says about the ending?
[0:29:34] awwyaaaa: Do you think for SoD they should have tried to add classes that wernt there in classic like monk or dh? :o
[0:29:39] Lythi: 360 noscoping that cast lmao
[0:29:49] Cafe0le: he then slows it and it is even more Susge
[0:29:49] nightmxz: Good morning buddy :)
[0:29:50] kreyzy8: I would love to see someone actually try to move their char like that KEKW
[0:29:59] Dogvaz2: how dare ye say big dam judge
[0:30:10] nikthevoker: @nightmxz that sounds awesome tho
[0:30:18] Dogvaz2: the miestro will curse you to oblivion for that
[0:30:27] Tyferious: Oh we vibin i like the vibe
[0:30:54] nightmxz: @nikthevoker You think it would be good if every healer had perfect gcds for healing?
[0:32:47] nutz_hang_uneven: healers look really fun
[0:32:47] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:32:52] marvin1995xo: ew bm hunter
[0:33:01] nikthevoker: i like it but it seems kinda far, but people would like it
[0:33:09] wolfylulz: yo venruki what you think is best mage spec to play with rogues in 2s?
[0:33:11] nikthevoker: seems like alot of healers get overwhelmed and dont know what to hit
[0:33:14] wolfylulz: i hope you answer me
[0:33:16] marvin1995xo: arcane
[0:33:25] skez_live: im having a lot tougher time on pally lately but it could just be a coincidence
[0:33:37] wyldeshock: VENRUKI hello good sir
[0:33:45] nutz_hang_uneven: healers look like they only heal now
[0:33:47] nutz_hang_uneven: tuff
[0:35:29] limit77: Haroo! OhMyDog
[0:36:19] skez_live: @nutz_hang_uneven one rogue asked me after a round if he could get a freedom, and the previous round i spent what felt like every global just trying to keep people alive lol
[0:36:21] tea_berri: that was a long one
[0:36:50] phenomenaIx: morning ven
[0:37:09] Tyferious: Do you think its harder to break out of low rating as a healer because other people don't know what there doing as much?
[0:37:09] ysbear: what keybind do you use to target your teammates
[0:37:17] Merkflare: worst is too many pally lobbies
[0:37:34] kingsamayoa1: if it’s my first time pvping is dh good and do I just play solo shuffle?
[0:37:49] AstralScare: @kingsamayoa1 DH is the best spec for solo shuffle
[0:37:54] kingsamayoa1: if I wanna get glad
[0:37:58] kingsamayoa1: oh
[0:38:10] heymomimonttv: @kingsamayoa1 yes dh is good but go play bg's or arena skirmish to learn pvp
[0:38:39] nimbus420i: wait did I tune into crusader's stream?
[0:38:51] Magottx: Had a frost destro lob on my warrior earlier. Not very fun.
[0:38:59] Merkflare: the lock just freecasting bolts there...
[0:39:34] TootinFresh: You hosting AWC this weekend?
[0:39:47] marvin1995xo: always great when bm does top damage
[0:39:53] driftwood_tc: "I dont know" Kappa
[0:40:21] driftwood_tc: Anyway looking forward to see you "maybe hosting" the AWC
[0:40:27] skez_live: @ysbear I'll re-ask since im also curious, what are your targeting keybinds? :)
[0:40:28] AstralScare: ^
[0:40:46] heymomimonttv: ziqo already said he's casting awc
[0:40:50] TootinFresh: AWC is short this time? 2 cups and finals
[0:41:17] Magottx: Feel your pain buddy. But since I’m a real homie I told you
[0:42:32] OttoFrank1945: Hello!
[0:42:46] salder9: big news
[0:42:55] Tyferious: @skez_live I think he said the other day he just uses f1 -f3 to target friendlys
[0:43:01] Nickystr1x: wow what a surprise i wouldnt have ever forseen ziqo casting awc
[0:43:05] nightmxz: I'm sure ziqo just meant in the past he HAS casted it Kappa
[0:43:07] heymomimonttv: i guess if he's not casting awc tho then he's allowed to say he is or whatever he wants lol
[0:43:15] kingsamayoa1: do you stream at night
[0:43:28] skez_live: do you use any target arena 1 2 3 for enemies?
[0:43:37] driftwood_tc: Is BM hunt pet dmg not showing on details again?
[0:43:56] driftwood_tc: the dmg shown doesnt seem right
[0:44:01] Synckery: it only shows when your on the same team as them
[0:44:06] Synckery: not when your vs them
[0:44:30] Nickystr1x: cosplaying as an rdruid, just sitting back bombing out heals
[0:46:07] nimbus420i: 3 purghes on their teama nd bop doesnt get purged
[0:46:08] nimbus420i: crazy
[0:46:19] driftwood_tc: +11 YUGE POGGIES
[0:46:43] KeriannaTheMage: Good morning Ven!! :)
[0:46:51] ssj_fajita: whats your opinion on MDI hosts suggesting that people buy m+ carries to get invites to keys of their skill level?
[0:47:18] zachgamegodx: whats your opinon and jahmllis list
[0:47:23] zachgamegodx: he rated all teh awc teams and players
[0:47:29] driftwood_tc: Yo btw thanks for both doing morning and evening streams. Makes us EU boys happy.
[0:47:41] ssj_fajita: naguura said for opeople in her streeam to buy keystone carries because they complain they cant get 3400 io
[0:48:01] Tyferious: Do you notice a difference between players from morning to night?
[0:48:04] NozakGaming: late night ruki is a vibe.
[0:48:20] froztitv: mw monk better that holy palal ?
[0:48:24] Nickystr1x: she's also known for being pretty sarcastic in a dry way so there's a chance it could have been entirely sarcastic
[0:48:30] froztitv: in high rate ?
[0:48:30] driftwood_tc: buying carries? DansGame
[0:48:58] Chopt: have you tried palworld offstream @venruki?
[0:49:00] heymomimonttv: @Tyferious i do, i try and push solo lobbies as dps in the morning cuz they're easier. at night the queues are longer and sweatier for sure
[0:49:17] NozakGaming: in wod you could spam denounce on hpal and it felt good
[0:49:18] skez_live: for sure
[0:49:21] Aro725: Does shield of the righteous do decent dam? its not bad in pve
[0:49:32] driftwood_tc: didnt palas have no CD exorcism spam in WoD?
[0:49:36] phenomenaIx: tried my pala, but just too used to how aggressive i can be as disc and you can't come close to that aggression on hpala
[0:49:45] nikthevoker: RIP i won the raid weap i wanted to try out in arena but was nice enough to let someone roll that didnt get to, regret it already LUL
[0:49:48] Tyferious: @heymomimonttv I agree, i wondered if at a certain rating its always sweaty
[0:49:50] Acurarx: same as mindblast!
[0:49:58] skez_live: Ven dont you have conq to replace your last greerns?
[0:50:01] skez_live: :)
[0:50:02] Acurarx: actually more :(
[0:50:09] skez_live: or were you planning to craft
[0:50:12] kingsamayoa1: wat is best class to start doing arenas with if new ?
[0:50:29] tarth_100: compared to shadowlands, no healer damage feels threatening this expac imo
[0:50:41] The__Swordmaster: Awesome transmog
[0:50:43] Nickystr1x: @kingsamayoa1 probably ret cause its sturdy and has good burst, lots of room to grow with skill but in low brackets you can farm
[0:51:09] 1_head_1: @kingsamayoa1 he will say hunter, but hunter sucks atm, these melleclasses are just annoying
[0:51:23] Alerothan: @kingsamayoa1 BM hunter does not suck wtf
[0:51:46] scubaclay: were there any changes today forgot to look
[0:51:46] nikthevoker: and hunters dont suck
[0:51:55] Saitistreamy: do you remember a season they called a AWC tournament " mid saeason" before?
[0:52:01] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Ozgiliath WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:52:05] 2916nick: but whats the answer then
[0:52:10] jaymaxs: @venruki what spec do you think is the best to learn pvp on not easiest but will teach you the most about pvp and help you get better overall?
[0:52:11] VarhatTheWarr: Yo Ven should i go full haste on frost? or some mastery?
[0:52:17] Ozgiliath: Ozgiliath subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:52:20] iTarnish_: @kingsamayoa1 play feral, if you can pull off the worst class in the game you’re a future glad
[0:52:22] driftwood_tc: BM hunt pretty weak right now... blizzard should definitely buff Pepega
[0:52:26] primejusticegaming: yoooo what up ven
[0:52:43] VarhatTheWarr: tnx
[0:52:46] VarhatTheWarr: <3
[0:52:48] kingsamayoa1: is mage hard
[0:52:48] 2916nick: does holy feel good rn? my pally is collecting dust
[0:53:08] 2916nick: i havent played since melee wings, is that still the playstyle?
[0:53:23] ssj_fajita: i just started playing wow 1 1/2 months ago with SoD and started retail last week and i played a fire mage with a rogue and got gladiator is 93 games
[0:53:27] Alerothan: Playing shuffle on these big maps as preservation feels so miserable. My teammates are determine to range me and never be in breath cone
[0:53:39] ssj_fajita: i practiced alot of aoe mage farming in SOD
[0:53:42] Badasti: does wing still cost holy power?

[1:01:45] Luigicamp: this sounds like the soundtrack of half of coming-of-age 80s movies
[1:01:56] Tiebot87: @venruki why do people downplay shuffle rating?
[1:02:02] Luigicamp: figured lol
[1:02:14] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: do you ever switch your auras mid game or is that not a thing?
[1:02:28] Tyferious: Do you have a command for you WA?
[1:02:40] Badasti: id love to go back to the 80's
[1:02:46] Badasti: id grow a macguyver mullet
[1:02:57] paliaco: All my exes live in texas... and texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
[1:02:58] Moobot: Latest video "Blizzard Is Adding An Achievement Mount To The Trading Post" view it here: youtu.be/RSOc2gON7w0
[1:03:06] nightmxz: I don't know if it has anything to do with the pace of the meta or just the game / their lives but NA lost flop and brain last season
[1:03:12] paliaco: but all my exes live in texas. and that's why I hang my hat in tennessee KKool
[1:03:27] Luigicamp: it was alright, if I went back again I'd want to be a teen again though, as an adult I probably wouldn't like it
[1:04:06] Alerothan: @nightmxz People eventually just want to move on too
[1:04:29] nightmxz: yeah I said that "their lives" lol
[1:05:40] draki259: It really sucks not being able to move a healthbar even when you've got mana and spamming heals
[1:05:45] Luigicamp: It was fun as a teen, I had fun
[1:06:00] nightmxz: All I know about the 80s is We didn't start the fire lmao
[1:06:06] Luigicamp: lol
[1:06:08] Kalakbar: 80s was fun, expo 86 was rad as a 3 year old
[1:06:11] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: it was good if youre a white male
[1:06:12] SteLawBro: The 80's was awesome because you didnt have a thing in your pocket telling you what was going on so everything felt safe lol.
[1:06:13] Scotch1230: pre-internet would be fun to mess around with, but I think I still prefer now.

[1:06:26] Nightbot: Join the official Venruki Discord: https://discord.gg/SGNHyz3Mah
[1:06:32] Badasti: dunno, i was pretty young but i sure loved NES and being outdoors
[1:06:36] Luigicamp: @Kalakbar 80s in diapers doesn't count! Kappa
[1:06:46] paliaco: You can do all you could in pre internet days all it takes is going outside and leaving your phone at home :)
[1:07:09] Kalakbar: pffft, then the 2020s with your 2nd hip doesn't either KEKL
[1:07:22] Badasti: i honestly would have hated being a kid after the early 2000's... Even as an adult I can't go out without looking at the top of peoples heads while they look at their phones
[1:07:51] StromicusRex: i love when everyone is on their phones, that means no one tries to start conversations with me
[1:07:52] isomething: being a kid in the 90s was the best
[1:07:54] Luigicamp: @paliaco yeah, back then we would give our parents the chance to miss us. Nowadays they follow their kid on Google Maps. LuL
[1:08:35] Luigicamp: ofc
[1:08:37] Luigicamp: 100%
[1:08:40] paliaco: I grew up on my pc from 13 to 22 and now that im ~27 every time I go out to do anything, even just walking or traveling, ive learned to enjoy the outside and the moment more than most normies, who right now are glued to their phones even outside
[1:08:41] Badasti: they wont know any better
[1:08:42] Yaycarrots: FeelsWeirdMan
[1:08:57] orcrimmar: internet forced kids to grow up waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too quick
[1:08:58] unc0de: they gotta make it like 18 years first...world is getting crazy
[1:09:03] Hobblefoot: They will all be dead. Climate change and all.
[1:09:27] Dogvaz2: @Hobblefoot most sane take
[1:09:48] ihavesmokedcrack: Kids born in 2000s are gonna look back like, I wish my parents didn't cut my dick off
[1:09:55] SteLawBro: I grew up in the 90's but i'd pick to be born a bit later if i could. Phones would have made my teen years infinitely better. Oh man, the things i missed out on because i couldnt just message somebody. 🙁
[1:10:16] Nickystr1x: queueing up shuffle as an undergeared lock is not what i would do with my day
[1:10:17] tarth_100: There was an article in the WSJ today that said 1 of 3 highschool kids these days self reported constant feelings of sadness compared to 1 out of 5 in 2008
[1:10:19] Badasti: climate change is like fusion technology, the end is always 10 years away LUL
[1:10:24] nightmxz: Baconator diff
[1:10:27] heymomimonttv: @ihavesmokedcrack this is def a crack smoker thing to say
[1:10:42] Ramaru37: the amount of times i've been told my healers in Solo shuffle to NOT port is staggering
[1:10:58] aaggros: I bet most of them are girls feeling that way
[1:11:06] Dogvaz2: i think this "i feel sad thing" has always been a thing people are just more ok to come out with it now. not necessarily a good or bad thing
[1:11:14] StromicusRex: ^
[1:11:16] fistweaveurnan: mental health crisis thx to libs
[1:11:17] Redmanpig: all those kids must play Ret
[1:11:34] Luigicamp: @Dogvaz2 definitely
[1:12:10] nearfatalcheeto9: thanks to the libs. found an incel guys
[1:12:14] Luigicamp: if you went around reporting your "feelings' to your friends when I was a kid you would be pointed and laughed at.

[1:13:05] Hobblefoot: Aren't we already beyond 20/21/22
[1:13:07] Dogvaz2: @Luigicamp nowadays i guess not too much, but the issue still  exists just as much so makes me think... are people more focused on conditioning themselves rather actually trying to find a permanent fix?
[1:13:14] heymomimonttv: @StromicusRex disappointing for sure
[1:13:30] Kalakbar: @nearfatalcheeto9 who hurt you
[1:13:39] nightmxz: Guess it was a baconator lobby the whole time
[1:13:48] Cryseth: @venruki noticing you are sometimes holding your blessing for a while, is there a reason for that? i usually try to get them out on cooldown unless its a complete waste ofc
[1:13:51] Dogvaz2: like people nowadays especially more likely to be on many pills and take all kinds of vitamins and stuff just to condition their issues, but don't want to exercise more cut sugar out and stuff to actually become healthy
[1:13:53] tea_berri: is that a forbear tracker to the right of ur frame i want
[1:13:54] hollow1zed: @venruki yo can i link you a song thats perfect for pally
[1:13:59] SteLawBro: Ones things for sure. Theres a problem. The qjuestion is, are we fxing the problem or profiting off it? LuL
[1:14:08] fistweaveurnan: @Luigicamp Strange we didnt have all the issues we do now back in those days
[1:14:13] BannyBoy: mr.Ruki is there  any  good  stuff  in trading  post ?
[1:14:16] Xeliumimar: Chat is very deep right now lol

[1:15:12] tarth_100: You questioned if kids would lament being born in the 2020s! We provided evidence lol
[1:15:14] Badasti: @StromicusRex its not a bad thing for people to have different opinions LUL
[1:15:15] aaggros: The problem with kids these days, is the adults around them
[1:15:29] blkylol: didnt know you swung that way @foxyllama
[1:15:31] mrxilio: @venruki can you name the band of this song without looking? :)
[1:15:34] Ahbadah: kids get the fuck beaten out of them for no good reason while the adults just stand there gawking
[1:15:35] Luigicamp: @Dogvaz2 I think people are more bombarded with everyone's opinions and advice nowadays, mostly due to internet and social media. In the 80s you would get that information from your parents or your usual couple of best friends. I see good and bad in both examples.
[1:15:36] heymomimonttv: ratt
[1:15:37] Merkflare: I saw news report that said children should have calculated risks during play and it made me tear up with positivity
[1:15:41] Ahbadah: that's why they're so sad
[1:15:47] SteLawBro: All you have to do is follow the money. Therin lies the answer to your many questions.
[1:15:51] StromicusRex: @Badasti not saying that

[1:18:56] mrxilio: @venruki how old are you? I dont think im much older than you
[1:18:59] Luigicamp: I fell from so many trees as a kid, cause climbing them was our IRL RPG version of video gaming. Idk how I am still in one piece.
[1:18:59] betasoldier: Did you make it though? Maybe the past couple decades has actually just been a fever dream flashing before your eyes before the end

[1:35:07] Hizuru1: @nightst314 you are slave to your own mind
[1:35:08] Badasti: I agree with him though, I only noticed today that you can buy a character boost with ilvl 424 gear now, that actually really annoyed me... I feel like it starts like this
[1:35:08] driftwood_tc: Oh no I remember getting this beauty
[1:35:25] hamsti: no 100% i agree. His reaction is just hilarious
[1:35:26] Jakedus91: thats sad
[1:35:30] Hizuru1: Therre is no excitement and no long run for wow
[1:35:32] SweatyDaniels: blizzard cashing in resubs next month
[1:35:34] Jux818: @hamsti exactly
[1:35:42] Hizuru1: Trading post is sub for money please here shiny for sub KEKW
[1:35:43] Intravz: tbh they might want it to die
[1:35:44] NerdEngineering: this is the trap of trying to please everyone. You can't appease casuals while keeping true gamers engaged.
[1:35:48] Saitistreamy: the bad argument for this, is that the game is also dieing in the long run right now
[1:35:56] driftwood_tc: I will ragequit if they make my MT legion druidforms become available again to plebs.
[1:35:57] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: There was a dataminmed infor where they are going to maake the BFA AH mount in the TP @venruki
[1:35:57] Bonegraft: in 10 years they may release another unobtainable!
[1:35:58] SweatyDaniels: they're following the CoD model
[1:35:59] Hizuru1: Game down bad desperate for all sub they can get OMEGALUL time to quit vote with your wallet
[1:36:00] cruelhabbitts: agree 100%
[1:36:04] Saitistreamy: so they need to pivot philosophy, current stratgey is not working
[1:36:09] DEATHEAGLE34: when is AWC?
[1:36:13] skez_live: ruining the game... ehhh i dunno
[1:36:17] nightst314: 70% of all people raiding Siege got this. it's overplayed drama, basically a grift
[1:36:17] nikthevoker: AGREE
[1:36:18] wreklol: the issue is blizzard geniunely believes the people that got the original rewards are old and don't play. giving access to them appeases the younger viewers who weren't around when they were in the game. the issue is that wow's demographic is 26-35
[1:36:18] hemm__: @DEATHEAGLE34 tomorrow
[1:36:19] iLLwiLL_HS: shit take gayu
[1:36:25] Saiyori: hard disagree. people should be able to obtain things like this- THOUGH, i would rather it be through a similar skill check rather than trading post.
[1:36:27] klocksmith: they should put  glad mounts on the trading p;ost
[1:36:30] Saitistreamy: numbers keep going down
[1:36:30] Badasti: its also bullshit like this that made the game less popular in the first place
[1:36:30] hiddensquid13: WoW is cooking!
[1:36:32] hamsti: WeirdChamp @iLLwiLL_HS
[1:36:33] Saitistreamy: that is dieing but slowly
[1:36:34] Jux818: Plus it's a steep slope what is stopping them from adding glad mounts
[1:36:38] SweatyDaniels: all i want is the jewel of the firelord head piece back on trading post
[1:36:39] Mrshmyt: its kinda has a non malignant tumor rn
[1:36:40] Hizuru1: Most monetizezd game in history pvp dead no updates for pve .
[1:36:41] Jux818: Slippery*
[1:36:46] Saitistreamy: the mount sucks lol
[1:36:46] cruelhabbitts: so many people play wow lol
[1:36:48] Judgejobrown: people confuse PvP dying with wow dying
[1:36:57] Jux818: True
[1:37:06] Blitzylive: "game is dying" has been said for over 10 years. Game is doing great. Blizzard does what they want, people complain. Game continues to do fine
[1:37:07] mipzee: imagine putting in the work to get aotc for it to be later on get it for 0 effort instantly
[1:37:09] Saiyori: oh, i thought it was purchasable....i just hate fomo
[1:37:11] hemm__: not sure why they wouldnt just recolor if they wanted to do something like this
[1:37:11] nightst314: items return within the trading post
[1:37:13] Scotch1230: not to argue because I agree with the sentiment. however, fomo challenge rewards are also bad
[1:37:16] nikthevoker: BUT muh PARtiCIpAtIOn TRoPHy
[1:37:16] Saiyori: (and i have the damn mount lol)
[1:37:17] Hizuru1: soon they will sell lpvp boost KEKW
[1:37:17] Tyferious: Why not make it accessible during time walking events. Maybe not every time walking event but like occasionally have the opportunity to go back and get some of these achievements
[1:37:23] Saitistreamy: @Blitzylive the game has been on a steady decline of playerbase for 10 years, yes that is correct
[1:37:24] notCheddy: they do return
[1:37:25] Badasti: @Blitzylive been way more than 10 years, it has been happening since i started in 2005
[1:37:36] klocksmith: might as well put glad mounts on the tradint post too
[1:37:38] earthspeakers: imagine them putting invincible on the trading post
[1:37:40] Saiyori: As someone who went thru 7 surgeries in 3 years, fomo sucks when life gets in the way.
[1:37:51] skez_live: there are a MILLION sick mounts and sets
[1:37:51] driftwood_tc: WoD CM set? wasnt that only weapons?
[1:38:03] moldybread00: @venruki do you have any TLDR tips for surviving opressive melee lobbies for dev?
[1:38:09] Saiyori: just put wod cmodes back in lol
[1:38:14] realglazed: @venruki I think everyone is focusing on random bullshit, the number 1 prio should be to make the game accessible to new players
[1:38:15] dornes97: Make it challenging to get then.
[1:38:16] nikthevoker: and then its on the trader post
[1:38:21] treggerpleb: Funniest healer in your opinion? @venruki
[1:38:24] Badasti: it also diminishes the value for people who actually did earn it
[1:38:29] Hizuru1: You know who is victim and man in chat
[1:38:30] wakener00: Preserving the challenge and keeping the challenge available to new players is more important than reward availability
[1:38:30] SweatyDaniels: it could make peopel more inclined to farm more recent /newer rewards
[1:38:34] Kilamonic: @treggerpleb hpal tells the best jokes
[1:38:39] Badasti: like why am i working hard for something only to have its value diminished
[1:38:39] Saitistreamy: Ven, if game isnt dieing, why are there 30% fewer R1 slots then in sl?
[1:38:40] nightst314: the challenge of doing siege of orgrimmar normal mode for 13 months
[1:38:42] Blitzylive: Blizz has said it costs a lot to make new designs
[1:38:44] Saiyori: death to fomo
[1:38:44] Scotch1230: I have my challenge mode set, but I think they could just keep the challenges in place and keep the reward.
[1:38:46] Hizuru1: because money greed for subs KEW
[1:38:49] SpacemanJohn: just like adding T3 sets to BMAH and the new naxx grind
[1:38:50] Blitzylive: so they favor reusing old stuff with new colors
[1:38:54] orcrimmar: i remember when that mount first came out, people were laughing at it because of how "bad" it was. now everyone is angry about it?
[1:39:03] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: how do you feel about taht Ven ?
[1:39:03] Jux818: And that's just pvp
[1:39:08] Judgejobrown: pvp death != wow death
[1:39:08] skez_live: yup
[1:39:11] foxyllama: i dont play 3s anymore
[1:39:15] Saitistreamy: okay, so why is M+ r1 slots also down?
[1:39:16] DaneDillon: In SL people were sitting at home not working too due to the rona
[1:39:21] Saitistreamy: and hall of fame not filling up?
[1:39:26] Hizuru1: You do not even know if you dont play with bots acting like solo is "community" is oxymoron.
[1:39:37] Saitistreamy: No
[1:39:37] Dalfire: Solo shuffle is the best thing that happened in wow.. but they need to fix the queue time
[1:39:38] hamsti: KEKW
[1:39:39] nightst314: meanwhile M+ has had higher player numbers than all of SL
[1:39:39] mrxilio: only want to play 3s to get a glad mount... if i cant push the mount then its not as appealing
[1:39:42] RedeemedbyJesus: Same. I only played WoW for 3s for the past 5 years and now I only play SS. SS > LFG.
[1:39:42] Badasti: @Saitistreamy instead of asking questions in a really obnoxious way, why dont you just make an arguement>
[1:39:47] yippey_: ^
[1:39:52] unc0de: Ven chat google: what is the sword of wyrnn title for
[1:39:53] Saitistreamy: My position is that, numbers are down is an issue, so they need to change thinking about the game strucutre. that means changing loops etc.
[1:39:57] Nefraaan: is the Gladiator title/mount attainable in solo shuffle or 2s?
[1:39:59] Saitistreamy: they is a expirment with that, maybe not the best one
[1:40:06] Scotch1230: My main issue is that FOMO isn't good design. It doesn't retain players. I think keeping challenges in place is much better overall.
[1:40:16] XilliumStorm: that was for ashran
[1:40:16] Saitistreamy: dieing is an overstatment, but declining is accurate
[1:40:26] Hizuru1: @Scotch1230 you are slave to your own mind
[1:40:32] skez_live: I think these upcoming 3 expansions are going to see the biggest numbers wow has had in a long time
[1:40:35] klocksmith: did u get that from tradint post too?
[1:40:38] RedeemedbyJesus: @Saitistreamy What total pvp numbers do you see that are down? I'm genuinely curious, not asking sarcastically or anything
[1:40:38] clicket: @Scotch1230 it retained me
[1:40:38] Nickystr1x: thats a cool title, can i please have it for free just by logging in?
[1:40:44] XilliumStorm: I am one of the few that actually loved Ashran back in the day
[1:40:52] unc0de: @venruki thank you ven, saved me a google. i twitter google all the time...lazy...sure, effective...sometimes
[1:40:56] Saiyori: @Scotch1230 100% agree
[1:41:00] Saitistreamy: @RedeemedbyJesus so r1 is based off the number of players, so number of r1 slots indicatesd how many people are doing an activity
[1:41:04] Hizuru1: You know who does not work out in chat ever  and just wants stuff throw at them for existing KEKW
[1:41:05] draki259: @Saitistreamy Arent all these numbers coming from a WoW during covid too. Kinda doesnt seem like the best representation
[1:41:08] rivellana: epic 80s music
[1:41:14] Saitistreamy: we do know the number of people who get r1, or do hall of fame
[1:41:17] Scotch1230: Right, but if I want to see if I could get my mage challenge set, I can't.
[1:41:19] mrxilio: Mounts earned > Free mounts... has always been that way.
[1:41:21] DaneDillon: I just worry they start putting Glad mounts, etc in the trading post.
[1:41:37] unc0de: @DaneDillon i mean honestly, who cares.
[1:41:39] Saitistreamy: @draki259 fair argument, but the failure to retain is an issue. also I dont know BFA numbers to argue it
[1:41:45] Scotch1230: yup, I would like that more
[1:41:48] RedeemedbyJesus: @Saitistreamy Oh you're just talking about 3s. I agree with Ven that the vast majority of players do SS nowadays.
[1:41:48] Dalfire: Wow is starting to look like politics in Canada
[1:41:54] unc0de: people get pixels in a game. who cares? just play game, get entertainment
[1:42:03] Saitistreamy: @RedeemedbyJesus right but m+ also down, and Hall of fame for Mythicv raid are also down
[1:42:04] mrxilio: lol what?
[1:42:07] moldybread00: im sure that confused the canadian XD
[1:42:08] Geowind: what LUL
[1:42:10] hamsti: lmfao wait what did u just say
[1:42:10] skez_live: @gandalf_the_pipe420 Doesnt matter honestly, just play retail if you want to play the modern game, you could always go back to do the old story if you want
[1:42:13] schdenfreude: @gandalf_the_pipe420 those are completely different games, play what looks more fun to you
[1:42:23] mipzee: wait till they start handing out glad mounts lol
[1:42:24] zeref_qq: LMFAO
[1:42:24] beastboyy122: WutFace WutFace
[1:42:25] pugulus_prime: I'm so glad I just play the game for fun and don't care about cosmetics one way or the other
[1:42:25] Saitistreamy: " all these new players are taking our benefits!"
[1:42:25] RedeemedbyJesus: But I would be intersted in seeing how many rated arena players there are now vs the last few expansions/seasons
[1:42:25] marvin1995xo: yea its awful blizzard is so mean
[1:42:27] klocksmith: cant wait to arena season 1 glad mounts on trading post
[1:42:31] Hizuru1: cchat are freeby losers l
[1:42:37] ripshiitus: I don't think i ever played for rewards. I just wanted to win. Mount or not. I just wanted to beat the other team. eventually i got mounts and titles too.
[1:42:38] Badasti: I think shareholders are the main problem for this game. They alienate their core to appease people who dont really give a shit, and they will be the first to leave anyway
[1:42:38] Pluckyz: sense of pride and accomplishment
[1:42:39] unc0de: @venruki I LIKE CANDY... WANNA FIGHT ABOUT IT???
[1:42:40] Luigicamp: if you collect all the mounts you get the Pixelated Achievement! Kappa
[1:42:44] marvin1995xo: they should respect ahotc
[1:42:46] Scotch1230: I just think they constantly remove content from older expansions. I really liked when they brought back the Mage Tower for example.
[1:42:48] Saiyori: then let it be about that effort and not fomo. put back in the bar for effort.
[1:42:50] betasoldier: My hot take is I don't care either way
[1:42:55] zeref_qq: yeah but dont gatekeep fun behind doors
[1:43:01] Jakedus91: Glad mounts in trading post WHEN.
[1:43:03] mrxilio: true... wouldnt care about a glad mount without the effort needed to get it
[1:43:06] Hizuru1: So many slaves to own mind in chat KEKW
[1:43:14] klocksmith: @venruki  will u care if  they put glad mount in trading post?
[1:43:21] Hizuru1: @Saiyori whole life is your "fomo" deal lwith it lol
[1:43:27] nightst314: turning this topic into some world-ending event is ridiculous. in 2 weeks nobody will care.
[1:43:27] blkylol: KEKW
[1:43:57] wreklol: just make glad mounts BOE so you can sell them on the AH. save boosters time
[1:43:58] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: what ppl should care honesly is rating and raiding progress , not transmogs mount or whatever else , Blizz should add everything so all ppl can have those stuff
[1:44:05] Saiyori: @Hizuru1 quite.I lost a decade of living to a disease that i couldnt get treatment for, i get it sweetie. I am allowed to not like it in a video game.
[1:44:10] nightst314: that mount wasn't "cutting edge" though, 70% of all guilds got it
[1:44:11] Hizuru1: @TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns clown take
[1:44:16] malvarcla: fomo mounts arent bad for the game. just because you simply want it but arent good enough to get it doesnt mean you should have it
[1:44:16] okcoolstory: why are u so chill bro
[1:44:19] NerdEngineering: honestly, in vanilla the lack of transmog was great, If they saw you in tiered gear, it meant something.
[1:44:22] Hizuru1: @Saiyori dont ccare pushing your issues on others
[1:44:26] Ronsimus: anyone thinking else has a complete lack of understand of human psycology and why most ppl play games
[1:44:27] unc0de: it would be like if they put invincible on the trading post....would it suck? maybe i guess, but like when invincible dropped for is a core wow memory ill never forget. but people want their uniqueness.
[1:44:38] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: @Hizuru1 ur domb bro
[1:44:38] varok87: 2400 Mount Achievement for Solo Shuffle when? rukiCreep
[1:44:39] Saiyori: @Hizuru1 lol. kinda sounds like what you're doing to me
[1:44:45] Saitistreamy: almost nothing permamently rotates out of overwatch
[1:44:56] bransby09: Same with apex, cool skin comes out , use it non stop but then it gets put on a random shuffle
[1:44:57] Hizuru1: @Saiyori I am not asking for freebies unlike you
[1:44:58] Saitistreamy: permament rotation out is a 2010 mindset
[1:45:01] dornes97: My ideal world: No rewards are ever made unobtainble, but they are also never made easier to get. For pvp, have a an increasing pool of elite sets/glad mounts, and you get one token each season to get one of your choice when you hit the appropriate rating
[1:45:07] Saiyori: @Hizuru1 i didnt say freebies. I said put the challenge back in the game.
[1:45:23] Hizuru1: @Saiyori no get new simple as that
[1:45:33] Hizuru1: Losers versus reall men in chat
[1:45:44] tea_berri: if they added a mount for doing like 500 rnds of shuffle that would be cool
[1:45:44] Saiyori: i have the mount in question lol
[1:45:47] hamsti: lmao i mean.... @Hizuru1
[1:46:03] Badasti: I want $50m but I'm 5'7 I don't want to play in the NFL or NBA. The world should give me money
[1:46:07] Hizuru1: You all should listen to FACTS song describes victims in chat KEKW
[1:46:09] nightst314: that's what your achievement +  date is good for
[1:46:10] Scotch1230: I think having more challenging content without FOMO rewards is my preference. I just like challenging content in WoW. I would agree they don't need to give back old FOMO rewards.
[1:46:11] Mckriminal: I toltaly agree
[1:46:14] Badasti: wait, im 5'9
[1:46:16] soddi: or just recolor it slightly, problem solved :D
[1:46:18] Badasti: same point
[1:46:20] malvarcla: I dont want someone to have my glad mount that they themself didnt earn. is it selfish yeah but thats the point
[1:46:28] dornes97: It honestly just sucks as a collecttor to not be able to get something you think is the coolest looking thing
[1:46:31] Hizuru1: So many self victims losers in chat KEKW d amm dudes imagine begging for freebies
[1:46:33] dornes97: but agree it shouldnt be on the trading post
[1:46:40] Mckriminal: well it just makes ppls goals worthless in the end
[1:46:53] panasiuk97: Do you you think a different payment model for wow would increase player base?
[1:46:54] Badasti: @dornes97 thats an overwhelming sense of entitlement
[1:46:56] Ronsimus: ppl are so entitled
[1:46:57] nightst314: collectors don't care about anything. they just care about 100%
[1:47:01] Mckriminal: yes
[1:47:12] Hizuru1: You know who puts work and who does not in chat and it shows
[1:47:13] rembrandt89: if they are gonna do old glad mounts on trading post it should just be different colors not the actual glad mounts
[1:47:17] eloriene: for sure keep it unique for the limited stuff. it’s a representation of the time & effort someone put in during that specific time. you know if someone has a unique mount or title from a raid or pvp season when they got it
[1:47:21] 3KuLTV: whats your opinion on dev evoker?
[1:47:22] hamsti: make something like the csgo skin market where you can sell your glad mounts for money Clap The real capitalism model.
[1:47:22] dornes97: Im not saying it should be easy, it can be really hard, but then you have something to aspire to
[1:47:30] hamsti: I'm tryna sell my glad mounts like csgo skins
[1:47:31] hemm__: again not sure why they cant just recolor seems like the best way to use all assets but also keep original rare. I mean obviously its a bit more work but...
[1:47:31] Badasti: collect pixels! They aren't in short supply
[1:47:34] mipzee: no such thing as rare anymore
[1:47:42] Askovan: just put everything into the shop. ppl can buy what they want and blizz makes money KEKW
[1:47:49] toffyfe_: did venruki already talk about awc?
[1:47:52] duridino: why do games have to try so hard to imitate real world and make people feel miserable. we are all trying to escape our shitty lives here
[1:47:55] XilliumStorm: they did
[1:47:59] SharmaJenkins: they wouldnt be first editions tho
[1:48:03] Mckriminal: lol just imagine if everyone had everything I would quit in 5 min
[1:48:05] Hizuru1: @duridino because humans play it clown
[1:48:18] ragergager: all these classic andys freaking out they cant buy gold and do gdkp anymore hilarious
[1:48:19] marvin1995xo: yea imagine pokemon are pokemons like digimons
[1:48:19] Saiyori: yeah, okay. artificial scarcity is dumb
[1:48:21] dornes97: you can get an original pokimon card if you are dedicated enough, you can never get old elite sets
[1:48:24] Vanisaris: There is a list of cards in MTG called the reserved list and it's one of the most controversial and hated things about Magic.
[1:48:26] Hizuru1: @duridino then seek mental help if game makes you feel like that for not having something KEKW
[1:48:28] dornes97: make it as hard as you want ohnestly
[1:48:40] marvin1995xo: imagine pokemons become digimons
[1:48:42] nightst314: people should frame this moment for once Asmongold&Co talk against Fomo again
[1:48:48] Hizuru1: so many self victims in chat giga soy KEKW
[1:48:54] Saiyori: Look at da beers diamonds, they own so many they create scarcity on the market
[1:48:54] yippey_: lol
[1:49:01] duridino: @Hizuru1 you seem a bit triggered by such an innocuous comment. maybe you need the help
[1:49:08] skez_live: Whenever i go down this rabbit hole I imagine having this conversation in person with my gamer friend and looking at my wifes face as she realizes how ridiculous it sounds
[1:49:09] Scotch1230: I personally think if it impacts gameplay, they 100% should reprint, but gameplay aside, no, respect the collectors.
[1:49:18] skez_live: then im like... yeah who gives a shit just have fun hah
[1:49:23] Hizuru1: @duridino I dont like people like you aint that deep go beg government for something
[1:49:28] malvarcla: I dont want someone having the same glad mount or title as me if they didnt earn it. simple as that
[1:49:36] Mckriminal: well if everyone thinks like that we would be in a real shit tho :p
[1:49:37] Saitistreamy: @Scotch1230 fuck MTG speculators, and insider trading market off a card game
[1:49:40] Hizuru1: @malvarcla real man
[1:49:42] hamsti: OMEGALUL
[1:49:43] duridino: @Hizuru1 you don't know me channel that hate on something more useful
[1:49:53] malvarcla: i know its selfish but that like the point lmao
[1:49:54] foxyllama: i dont give a fk about cosmestics so fk it
[1:49:56] nightst314: why do people compare gladiator rewards to a raid reward for a normal mode kill?
[1:49:56] foxyllama: give it away
[1:49:58] Hizuru1: @duridino you are what you say aint that deep
[1:50:01] Merkflare: collectors want to possess things without earning them, its weird energy
[1:50:18] isseswagger: just recolor shit and everybody is happy
[1:50:21] Scotch1230: Magic the Gathering has a problem with a reserve list that is the long impact of FOMO. You literally can't afford to play some formats because of it. Super lame.
[1:50:24] Saiyori: @Hizuru1 hes just a troll
[1:50:30] Lamatastisch: I only started with pvp, because I wanted an elite set in wod. Never got the set I wanted but since then I just love to get the sets. Without goals, the content just seems lame imo
[1:50:32] mipzee: what was the sham going to trinket there xD
[1:50:33] ragergager: h pall fun?
[1:50:37] duridino: @Hizuru1 we exchanged 2 messages total mr armchair doctor
[1:50:38] moldybread00: @venruki can u show talents
[1:50:44] dornes97: As a collector: when its hard to get it feels better, so im not saying it should be given away
[1:50:45] setbackttv: oi sup ven im the ret
[1:50:47] skez_live: did he trinket the hoj and get immediatetly feared?
[1:50:48] moldybread00: ty
[1:50:57] moldybread00: so ur single glimmer for the dr
[1:50:58] varok87: Shaman was saving trinket for another day i guess
[1:51:10] Scotch1230: yup, love that
[1:51:13] Hizuru1: @duridino that is enough victim go to block
[1:51:17] hemm__: it's really not
[1:51:20] hemm__: just do that
[1:51:26] tea_berri: when u say morning coffee with ven is there ever some liquor in that cup
[1:51:28] nightst314: recolor it: here's what's gonna happen: Bad because recolor
[1:51:43] clicket: there's gonna be recolors that are better than the original and that's gonna piss people off lmao
[1:51:48] Saiyori: They could do like League did with their prestige skins.  Exclusive for a limited amnt of time, then available but more difficult to earn than they origianlly were.
[1:51:49] Vanisaris: Difference between cards and cosmetics is that the items don't affect gameplay. With MTG, the cards are literally some of the most powerful cards in the game and prevent people from playing old formats by not being reprinted.
[1:51:50] DaneDillon: I love the look of the netherdrakes so I went and grinded to get the non-glad versions because it was as close as I could get.
[1:51:52] Hizuru1: You dont argue with losers  no one cares if recolor.
[1:51:55] Badasti: idk, i agree its a good way to shut people up, but it still annoys me that it's catering to peoples sense of entitlement to everything
[1:51:55] hemm__: also wonder why they are starting with that mount... seems random
[1:51:58] Saitistreamy: @tea_berri lol " are you an acholic?"
[1:52:02] kreyzy8: if he was a bot he would've trinketed last round LUL
[1:52:12] kreyzy8: unless its the worst bot ever

[1:52:40] kreyzy8: lmao he's stuck to the ground KEKW
[1:52:40] Hizuru1: Blizzard putting AI healers to solve issue
[1:52:41] Saitistreamy: there is a HUGE amount of cheating, but people want to be like " Only real ones should get it"
[1:52:45] axelrodp: lol
[1:52:46] foxyllama: maybe not
[1:52:47] varok87: oh he is back xD
[1:52:48] foxyllama: wtf
[1:52:51] Datguyjay: he's watching the stream OMEGALUL
[1:52:52] foxyllama: maybe hes just weird
[1:52:54] tea_berri: woah he did a jump
[1:52:57] SwiisH_Tv: ive ran into a couple resto sham bots recently
[1:53:04] tea_berri: hes jumpin so convincingly
[1:53:05] Saitistreamy: no he is botting just at his compuiter, modifying it slightly
[1:53:07] DaneDillon: @ImJordanHi I am not sure what point you are trying to make here.
[1:53:11] Alexxhaal: is that how all pvp gods view me when i enter arenas? xD god im bad at pvp and hope tpo get better one day so people dont confuse me to be a robot lmao
[1:53:20] Saitistreamy: bots arent 100% auto run usually
[1:53:33] Saitistreamy: thats just the most obvious bots
[1:53:39] ImJordanHi: Lol just that you farmed the old drakes because you wanted the glad back then, which is cool and how it should be done. People's argument is they didnt get to do it so they should get it now
[1:53:43] ImJordanHi: @DaneDillon
[1:53:52] Hizuru1: @Saitistreamy fallsel blizzzad has own 100% auto run bots
[1:53:54] tea_berri: i thought u had to move it and it did rotation and kicks
[1:54:11] ImJordanHi: @DaneDillon I was just making fun of the people who want the old glad mounts back, instead of doing what you did and finding an alternative thats close
[1:54:21] DaneDillon: @ImJordanHi Oh I farmed the drakes like 3 months ago because I have always been jeaous of the glad versions of it. lol
[1:54:24] rakkenl: holy shit
[1:54:25] Saitistreamy: @Hizuru1 yeah, bots can be 100% auto, but people bot and script with a degree of input often to avoid getting obvious reported
[1:54:26] rakkenl: lol
[1:54:29] Scotch1230: crazy game
[1:54:38] ImJordanHi: @DaneDillon Lol nah I got you, that's what people should do.
[1:54:47] skez_live: your are killing the hpal games so far today :D
[1:54:51] DaneDillon: @ImJordanHi Oh yeah, exactly!
[1:54:54] skez_live: knock on wood
[1:54:55] Hizuru1: @Saitistreamy you get banned for using chat as HUMAN than there being army of bots reported nonstop .
[1:55:29] kreyzy8: I don't think he's a bot he's just extremely fried LUL
[1:55:45] Scotch1230: how common are bots now?
[1:55:47] kreyzy8: he's actually jumping and stuff
[1:55:50] skez_live: ROFL the random lavaburst
[1:55:51] Saitistreamy: @Hizuru1 what?
[1:56:06] T0PNI: a LOT of new players heal like this, if your team isnt pressuring them with cc/kicks they never learn that standing in the open like that is bad
[1:56:08] hamsti: monkaS
[1:56:08] Datguyjay: what if he's just looking at his actionbars LUL
[1:56:27] Hizuru1: @Saitistreamy like what I said
[1:56:27] Saitistreamy: look at the shamans healing break down
[1:56:30] Saitistreamy: and see how optimal it is
[1:56:41] Endofdreams: ascendance
[1:56:44] Endofdreams: proc
[1:56:46] orianrrrr: Ascendance healing
[1:56:47] nikthevoker: isnt that asc
[1:56:48] zen_oni_shinobi: I would have loved to have had a glad title, personally. i played when arena was introduced in original tbc, but could never find partners.  there were two teams i had a lucky break that had the potential.  one i was benched on a 3x 5v5 glad team. the other was playing mage rogue with a really good mage.
[1:56:51] kreyzy8: he got insane procs I guess
[1:56:53] Saitistreamy: hes a bot
[1:56:57] Saitistreamy: optimized for it
[1:56:58] foxyllama: short game and lucky
[1:57:02] Saitistreamy: to produce procs
[1:57:09] earthspeakers: i mean just a quick game tbh
[1:57:17] Saitistreamy: it'll be like that almost every game
[1:57:19] skez_live: this guy my new favorite shaman
[1:57:28] hamsti: rshams are so busted they need to be nerfed immediately Kapp
[1:57:28] SwiisH_Tv: i also think 100% bot with someone at the computer
[1:57:30] skez_live: just go out the gate and press the fkn buttons yo
[1:57:34] ALLtheEXP: y is the shaman so good
[1:58:00] zen_oni_shinobi: i literally got discouraged in my pursuit when, after 10 + years of pvping there were 12 year olds walking on and getting carried on teams out of nowhere.
[1:58:21] zachgamegodx: did that guy just sidestep his cast to ground a rep when he can wolf it rofl
[1:58:25] zachgamegodx: that guys feed asf
[1:58:29] DaneDillon: Those grounding totems are sus AF
[1:58:30] skez_live: ROFL
[1:58:31] NomFries: ai is learning
[1:58:44] skez_live: improved a shitload since game 1
[1:58:45] Scotch1230: lmao
[1:58:46] Datguyjay: AUTO BOTS ROLL OUT
[1:58:49] kusoneko: LITERAL GOD
[1:58:50] SwiisH_Tv: its a bot fosho
[1:58:54] Saitistreamy: check healing break down for each round
[1:58:57] Xeliumimar: if it was a bot wouldnt it be 6-0ing lol
[1:58:57] hamsti: if its a bot its an absolute dogshit bot KEKW
[1:58:58] andretofo: He's a bot I'm telling you
[1:58:58] setbackttv: i stomped every healing stream
[1:58:58] Hizuru1: @Zen_Practitioner damm you giga bad 10 years of like trying or what even

[1:59:11] Askovan: his cat jumped on the keyboard
[1:59:16] Hizuru1: Blizzzard putting AI healerls to solve issue simple as that
[1:59:18] kreyzy8: idk this guy has a billion alts of different classes
[1:59:20] Hizuru1: they did it for pve
[1:59:21] Saitistreamy: so top and 2nd are ascendance procs
[1:59:22] kreyzy8: he got glad last season
[1:59:30] Saitistreamy: @kreyzy8 cheating is prevelant
[1:59:38] Saitistreamy: blizzard is bad at catching it
[1:59:43] rembrandt89: so did Pokemon
[2:00:01] hamsti: bots are insane for some classes.... maybe i'm biased but healikng isn't one of them
[2:00:01] duridino: message him and ask 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 00100000 01100001 00100000 01100010 01101111 01110100 00111111
[2:00:02] zen_oni_shinobi: @hizuru1 nah man, after tbc i just stopped trying cause college came up, then i joined the army after getting my degree, so i wasn't able to play as much.  when i would play i'd see people online for less than 1 month at max level getting carried to a title so i was like "nahh i'm good." lol
[2:00:14] hamsti: getting glad as a healer is like 90% positioning which bots don't do... rofl
[2:00:23] Saitistreamy: @hamsti healing and melee dps are the easiest ones
[2:00:27] zen_oni_shinobi: you son of a biscuit eating bulldog.
[2:00:29] Hizuru1: @Zen_Practitioner does not count then loll I think anyone can be glad who actually tries
[2:00:39] Saitistreamy: like just google for a bit
[2:00:44] Saitistreamy: and you'll see what classes bot the easiest
[2:00:50] Saitistreamy: DIsc priest is very common for botting
[2:01:02] hamsti: botting the easiest, and being successful at botting are two entirely different things
[2:01:11] BadCopy92: jab what cmonBruh
[2:01:23] Saitistreamy: @hamsti no, its the same in this context, it pushes you highest in rating and is most prevelant is what I mean
[2:01:25] Somanie: catJAM
[2:01:33] Saitistreamy: bot players arent class loyalist
[2:01:41] Somanie: What it do ven
[2:01:42] Saitistreamy: they just play whatever hjas the best program for success
[2:02:07] majorpipoo: @venruki hallo  when does awc matches start this week to watch

[2:03:41] chaps_86: insta dispell that hoj
[2:03:44] hamsti: weird. I haven't played in like 2 years so i have absolutely no idea whats going on anymore @Saitistreamy i just would have thought bots wouldn't be good at what healers do --- guess depends what comps you play -- and solo shuffle is a completely different beast
[2:03:46] zen_oni_shinobi: @hizuru1 lol for sure. there was a mage that gave me a chance, but he server xferred to cho'gall  like three days after we made a team. he was really good. i think he was in nerf sap 9, too.  if you've never seen those videos they're a good watch.

[2:06:24] zen_oni_shinobi: awkward family christmas dinner, right?  hey how's master splinter doing, ashley? lol

[2:06:40] mvpala_tv: yee im liking the hpal content tho
[2:06:47] Gotheels: was he actually shearing at the exact same point of the cast bar each time?
[2:07:00] setbackttv: Every healing stream vanguards kills so i make sure to do it now, it really gets tempo on rshams
[2:07:03] ALLtheEXP: @kusoneko This may be the future

[2:32:05] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: @ItsJhelo Well what does that say about the average player? Why can't they hit the most basic go targets in game instead of running around attacking a fury warrior over a boomy every other game

[3:10:12] ATHLTE: good stuff
[3:10:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think keeping the gladiator mounts special is the way to go
[3:10:23] Vigi9413: if they put it up on the TP then it just makes the achievements people got back then not worth it
[3:10:23] Kymagez: I got it in mop, couldn't care less
[3:10:27] addyz0r: KEKW
[3:10:42] ZealotryTV: like p2w wasnt always there lol
[3:10:54] gelatokush: this is the average mans hands not just wow players MyAvatar
[3:11:15] Morodox: its not about the mount, its just if they put that "10 year old mount" in the trading post it sets the precedent for the future rewards
[3:11:17] Morodox: why stop there
[3:11:22] Juliio29: listen ima simply put it for you turds, if you’re good your good if you’re bad you shouldn’t be rewarded the same as people that take the game seriously.
[3:11:33] invincibledalyeth: you wanna let me buy glad off you ? lol
[3:11:35] DamenShox: what we all want is the ah mount in the TP
[3:11:41] skez_live: HATE slopes man
[3:11:48] ZealotryTV: i was referring to his tweet lol would liek to see he bank statement from back in the day
[3:11:50] zen_oni_shinobi: i actually understand people buying gladiator.  sometimes they do have the skill to play on a glad level team, but can't get noticed by teams until they flash cash to secure a spot.
[3:11:50] Snoozy_Fps: End if the day it’s more rewarding to earn it
[3:12:07] Badasti: as someone who has never had a glad mount there is plenty of other shit in the game and im glad some things are exclusive
[3:12:17] Vigi9413: February TP is just gonna be a bunch of heart type stuff isn't it
[3:12:28] Foe009: you will be able to buy it later on xbox store, just wait for it ;)
[3:12:35] Kymagez: Yet they giving tcg mounts
[3:12:43] gelatokush: yea but i dont have a glad mount NotLikeThis
[3:12:46] c0gnusTV: tcg mounts are still obtainable
[3:12:47] nutz_hang_uneven: who cares
[3:12:51] balistikk64: @venruki does the AWC have a stream tomorrow or just the weekend?
[3:12:55] enviscerate: tcg arent skill based limited time rewards
[3:12:56] Somanie: TRUU wtb Swift Spectral Tiger
[3:13:09] hollow1zed: i completely agree to keep mounts exclusive but i feel like the elite mog could be something they could reimplement via special saddles at x rating @venruki
[3:13:19] morrs: DIVINE STOOOOOOOOOOORM
[3:13:26] morrs: :d
[3:13:32] nutz_hang_uneven: just make the game better
[3:13:41] buffevoker: Bluecheese im addicted to bluecheese
[3:13:42] Badasti: @hollow1zed i think there are some pvp rewards they can implement without taking away from current rewards, we pay more than enough money
[3:13:52] Airitreya: which mount was available in the trading post that was rare?
[3:14:01] zen_oni_shinobi: man i feel bad for people that paid tons of money for a swift spectral tiger.  imagine getting that right before dragonflight and now everyones flying around.  not even flying we're gonna make your ground mount impractical by gliding around at the speed of balls.
[3:14:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Recolors are the way to go
[3:14:05] manyforless: what about elite sets that i only have parts of
[3:14:07] gelatokush: they should make glad mounts tradeable, would u give me one Ven?
[3:14:08] happyheals: I don't want to have to clean all that old armor
[3:14:10] hollow1zed: i mean i agree with that as well
[3:14:10] GiiGa07: Like mage tower sets
[3:14:23] pugulus_prime: Up res them and recolor it everyone gets something new then
[3:14:31] manyforless: i feel like u should be able to obtain the rest of the set if u have sine
[3:14:31] goesidd: theres alot of items in this game, everyone doesnt need to have everything
[3:14:32] xoHOLLOW: what do you think about themed pvp seasons like how overwatch, apex, and other games have?
[3:14:35] manyforless: some
[3:14:39] balistikk64: @venruki does the AWC have a stream tomorrow or just the weekend?
[3:14:52] enviscerate: @manyforless im missing 1 or 2 pieces of like 11 sets :/
[3:14:59] hollow1zed: @Badasti im just madge i didnt play legion so i missed the elite mog LUL
[3:15:13] skez_live: @venruki  you ever play Hand of Divinity or thoughts on it?
[3:15:14] happyheals: they should start using the island expedition ships for current content tmogs, mounts, and pets
[3:15:32] Badasti: @hollow1zed I get you, I play a druid as well and not having the mage tower forms for my druid is really annoying. The only reason I never played that expansion is because of the stupid borrowed power systems
[3:15:33] gelatokush: legion was such a rip for i remember i pre purchased legion and never even played it a minute
[3:15:35] Morodox: individual teams may stream, no official stream though until weekend @balistikk64
[3:15:39] Badasti: I still thing some stuff should be sacred in this game
[3:15:40] happyheals: find a way to use different expac features to keep them relevant
[3:15:41] zen_oni_shinobi: @hollow1zed legion wasn't bad if you didn't mind being an unstoppable god king with every ability being an i-win.
[3:16:05] INeedaRandomhero: why are you dispelling it?
[3:16:32] INeedaRandomhero: is it still worth it with the backlash buffs?
[3:17:16] Rzzzi: shaman oom
[3:17:18] buffevoker: Venruki do you ever play the one shot sac
[3:17:22] toltekov: nice music
[3:17:25] Aiakos21: Did you see cdews vid on prevoker?
[3:17:26] toltekov: !music
[3:17:27] gelatokush: i jus thad the same exact lobby as frost mage
[3:17:30] zen_oni_shinobi: i remember playing resto shaman in a game with a destro lock and a boomkin.  they told me to lay skyfury so i went around the pillar to hide it so it didn't get obliterated.  they got sooo mad the skyfury wasn't down within .1 seconds of the call.  they still got it and demolished their target
[3:17:36] gelatokush: wasnt able to win with affy
[3:17:44] toltekov: looks like NIN
[3:17:44] xoHOLLOW: thats an rbg talent lol
[3:17:46] NASAdesigner: give u souls vs locks
[3:17:51] Proffzx: that guys build is dogshit
[3:17:54] wackpoetic: it also gives you souls for hp/fury
[3:17:57] clicket: glimpse is only good if you can use it
[3:17:58] gelatokush: frost affy is crap
[3:18:00] willie_stroker_99: he generates fury this way is he has the other talent as well
[3:18:07] clicket: he's bigbraining
[3:18:08] NASAdesigner: @wackpoetic for 20% dmg LUL
[3:18:10] ALLtheEXP: I play BloodMoon into RDruid melee cleave teams
[3:18:18] ALLtheEXP: otherwise that guy needs to change his talents
[3:18:40] Proffzx: its not good unless you are running it with unending hatred for fury farming. he should be glimpse glaive and imprison
[3:18:40] zen_oni_shinobi: i remember this song.. powerman 5000 right? this song was playing the first time i vanished a locks deathcoil
[3:18:50] ALLtheEXP: @Zen_Practitioner Insane
[3:19:02] NASAdesigner: its for lock pets spawns a soul for 20% dmg :)
[3:19:16] toltekov: sober lyrics music...
[3:19:19] zen_oni_shinobi: @ALLtheEXP actual other world plays.
[3:20:02] unc0de: w1

[3:21:09] gelatokush: yesturday on my dh i forgot i had immo dispel and faced splay was really not fun XD
[3:21:49] ferahgok: that's what I hate most about dh, they can just randomly immune and dodge stuff without thinking about it
[3:21:54] Proffzx: glimpse is a must. its one of the best gap closers, you ahave the ability to be immune to everything for 3 seconds once ever 24 seconds.

[3:48:01] VetisBR: but that guy probs too dumb to see what you did there
[3:48:04] RedeemedbyJesus: I'm actually starting to wonder if bot healers is the answer. That bot MW you had the other day was playing at like 2.4k rating lol

[3:49:34] happyheals: oh I know you can get adaptive swarm off on gate before it starts
[3:49:36] Msv2: I think blizz should give warlocks insta cast port and gate at start of the game
[3:49:36] NightMunchies: i play a warlock
[3:50:06] NightMunchies: they have
[3:50:12] happyheals: just give everyone ghates, and make warlocks dark mages
[3:50:18] happyheals: gates
[3:50:20] NightMunchies: that be funny
[3:50:38] NightMunchies: dk waygates
[3:50:44] buffevoker: Warlocks should get blink and alter time
[3:51:04] NightMunchies: play a void
[3:51:13] Protties: hey all. when’s AWC qualifiers? would love to watch it somewhere
[3:51:25] happyheals: Warriors just need vanish, cloak, divine shield, ice block, convoke, and lust
[3:51:31] gelatokush: the only one who should have alter time is evokers cuz the ycan control the bronze flight magic
[3:51:31] happyheals: and they will be leet
[3:51:31] NightMunchies: void locks are awesome racial free blinks
[3:51:42] NightMunchies: point n shoot
[3:52:00] NightMunchies: thats why i play 1 for the blink
[3:52:13] NightMunchies: gets me outta trouble
[3:52:26] gelatokush: 3 min cd tho right
[3:52:31] masterchlaes: What is that nameplate addon setup?
[3:52:36] NightMunchies: 2min i think
[3:52:45] frazzoqt: What mmr is this?
[3:52:54] NightMunchies: but thats for emerency
[3:52:55] ahhh__chu: did that pvp change where plate armor got nerfed go through already?
[3:52:57] gelatokush: most op is your immune to push back the teleport is jus textra
[3:53:02] NightMunchies: emergency
[3:53:19] gelatokush: no wait that void
[3:53:42] NightMunchies: voids have a raciasl i think its 2 mins im not sure
[3:53:47] NightMunchies: racial
[3:54:05] NightMunchies: either or they can blink 3mins is not that long
[3:54:58] NightMunchies: even panda racial is OP
[3:55:16] gelatokush: i would put all on use racials at 2 min cd
[3:55:26] NightMunchies: i agree

[3:55:47] Morodox: it might be an 0-6 angle for the hunter
[3:55:48] jacob_the_mage: lock it in
[3:55:50] Endoraesh: 6-0 or bust

[3:58:57] NightMunchies: so survive shits on war in 2s that i gotta see
[3:59:33] heymomimonttv: maybe if you're bicmex or a really good surv hunter. i play both surv and arms and i shit on most surv hunters i come across
[3:59:46] heymomimonttv: and i'm higher rated on surv than i am arms
[4:00:22] Swolbasaur: Like when do you come in for melee and range for surv hutners? that is the most confusing part
[4:00:33] Morodox: I play SV at like 2400 rn in 2's @heymomimonttv and I agree, the war matchup is really hard. not unwinable but hard
[4:01:42] orcrimmar: @Swolbasaur i recommend following/watching bicmex. he also has a great guide on how to play survival on youtube

[4:05:07] mikgullll: @orcrimmar Ty :D
[4:05:23] danieltsmoke: demo is probably the most anticlimactic...0 instan gratification, lol
[4:05:45] gaulois62: all of that good kiting to die on a warrior that brind dead stay on you lol
[4:05:52] gaulois62: and does nothing more D
[4:05:53] gaulois62: XD
[4:06:26] danieltsmoke: Warr rogues and locks are blizzards favorite children, lol. Dudes are never not top tier
[4:06:43] PwnStar916: @venruki so are there classes that excel in SS but dont do so great in real 3s?
[4:07:30] baxter5569: @KhingEQ i think its the other way around :) some do well in SS but not in 3s due to coordination. but i think all classes can be played at a high level
[4:07:54] wackpoetic: KhingEQ Devoker is probably a good example of spec that is good in SS but not as good in 3s. balance in general is pretty good right now though
[4:08:03] katastropheexdee: does anyone know if warbands with include current renown?
[4:08:11] baxter5569: @wackpoetic some EU teams are rocking Dev outlaw druid and owning
[4:08:19] katastropheexdee: will*
[4:08:20] baxter5569: just depends on the matchups
[4:09:33] wackpoetic: anything is probably viable with Outlaw/Rdru though

[4:10:19] driftwood_tc: Didnt you say go mage in the start?
[4:10:20] PwnStar916: @wackpoetic that like devoker, the dmg is insane and in SS your not coordinated so if he burst and someone falls short something dies. in 3s with coordination, well you can decide what to use. so devoker is a good example
[4:10:32] Msv2: Yeeee
[4:10:32] PwnStar916: @wackpoetic is it more of a melee or caster meta atm?
[4:10:52] driftwood_tc: How dare you use logic and common sense
[4:10:56] PwnStar916: @wackpoetic and is the meta different from SS or 3s

[4:36:47] ItsBees: good, rogues don't deserve anything
[4:36:53] happyheals: warrior gonna get stuff to fight trash mobs while other classes get god tier stuff

[4:38:08] seraph_wow: pog
[4:38:17] chaps_86: lol you ding 60 and are instantly in dragonflight...
[4:38:24] Badasti: whats the point of this classic business if they are just turning it into retail
[4:38:27] buffnac: oh shit hunters get melee specialization and dual wield
[4:38:56] DeityRevert: SoD players starved for content. they must be hyped
[4:39:05] happyheals: meNWHILE SOME CLASSES STILL TRYING TO GET IN A BFD PUG
[4:39:10] happyheals: sorry caps
[4:39:32] Solastro: 12 employees for all of esports
[4:39:44] Badasti: yeah god forbid the executives arent absolutely maximising profit at all costs
[4:39:50] famous1939: looks like ven will be working behind the camera now too
[4:39:51] DeityRevert: yikes
[4:39:52] famous1939: better get to it
[4:39:54] Badasti: i fucking hate share holders
[4:40:02] orcrimmar: You going to keep playing SoD Ven?
[4:40:06] storebraad: i dont think abilities is what makes retail into a bad game. I dont see these runes making SoD bad neither. The riad must be good, Stranglethorn...
[4:40:09] GoldenA_: do you know how it could affect the show?
[4:40:21] famous1939: instead of music, supa will now rap god the whole time
[4:40:26] Rissla: Wasn't it like 2k ppl that had to go from Activision Blizzard?
[4:40:33] Chris7ka: Wait so no AWC this weekend? Or is it still undecided?
[4:40:34] chaps_86: next awc prize pool: $25,000 -_-
[4:40:49] Badasti: sure do, in the prev company we had investors as well, past a certain point in the companies development your primary objective is to make them richer
[4:40:52] MaximumnNeo: @Badasti the biggest shareholders in Canada are Canada pension plan and teachers pension plans. ie. regular people
[4:40:54] happyheals: Microsoft has to make the acquisition fit intoi their future plans. Keeping people that make mid tier content isn't wise moving forward
[4:41:09] SNAKEBOMBS22: best mog in game
[4:41:16] whspe: Clap
[4:41:20] Badasti: @MaximumnNeo nonsensical argument, teachers and pensioners arent profiting from blizzard i promise you
[4:41:40] MaximumnNeo: @Badasti they are if they own the share in their pension, which they do
[4:41:45] MaximumnNeo: they basiclly all own microsoft
[4:42:04] raeza444: the purpose of life is to satisfy shareholders
[4:42:32] chaps_86: 3 dps over 120k jesus
[4:42:52] Chris7ka: @chaps_86 Giga lobby
[4:42:54] MaximumnNeo: people think shareholders are boogymen, when reality is 70% of the market is owned by public pension plans, social security, and retail mutual funds/etfs
[4:42:58] Badasti: @MaximumnNeo hey dude, if you think that billionaires etc care about pensioners, teachers or anyone else then all the power to you bro
[4:43:22] MaximumnNeo: I never said they did, i said shareholders are just regular people
[4:43:29] swolecolemole: DK is actually really good its just that 10.2.5 dk life
[4:43:41] Mhortai: Hi @venruki I just want to say I am thinking and hoping for the best for the WoW esports team. Just wanted to say that. <3
[4:43:42] Badasti: we both know im not talking about regular people, you're creating a strawman
[4:43:43] Alerothan: @MaximumnNeo This is the most delusional take I've ever seen but I wish I could live with that belief

[4:44:38] happyheals: People aren't quite grasping how a corporation operates
[4:44:45] MaximumnNeo: @Alerothan its not delusion its fact. lmfao. Billionaires generally dont often own the majority of their shares in public companies.
[4:45:02] triggertilted: what a throwback of a song
[4:45:19] MaximumnNeo: @wackpoetic they arent, but for example when Social security comes knocking, its owned by peopel will small share holdings, the companies pay attention
[4:45:24] wackpoetic: MaximumnNeo so are Blackrock and Vanguard looking out for the little guys?
[4:45:34] Badasti: @MaximumnNeo and the public arent consulted on business decisions
[4:46:00] MaximumnNeo: @Badasti they absolutely are, the public pension plans have massive influence on invesment
[4:46:09] MaximumnNeo: just not individuals
[4:46:28] Alerothan: @MaximumnNeo You're one of those people who think Elon is a genius arent you
[4:46:33] Badasti: invest in activision blizzard and let me know when they ask you for your opinion
[4:46:51] happyheals: I get emails all the time asking me
[4:46:57] pazta9: Damn you played it sooo good too
[4:46:57] paladinsareepic: im on 2,4 cr soloshuffle with my arms and the games are pain ... is it the spec or is it me?!
[4:47:02] chaps_86: dhs are so broken if there's no rogue
[4:47:07] Badasti: @happyheals did you vote to lay off staff then?
[4:47:18] JNE14: make your self a dh!
[4:47:18] MaximumnNeo: @Alerothan not at all, you are just one of those people who reads reddit and doesnt have a clue how the world actually works
[4:47:21] fistweaveurnan: Its wild that DH/ret is a insane comp right now almost exclusively because of their damage

[4:47:59] wowsuomi: Activision blizzard doesn't exist anymoe its just microsoft now
[4:48:18] JNE14: whatever good that is
[4:48:23] happyheals: Blizzard had nothing to do with the layoffs, so shareholders had zero input
[4:48:35] happyheals: it is a hostile take over
[4:49:07] Badasti: @MaximumnNeo whats your experience? because I was a part of senior leadership in a company that IPO'd for 11 billion. Past a certain point every decision is dictated by what makes the most money for investors  Regardless of how you frame it I'm entitled to dislike it dude
[4:49:13] raeza444: fellas its ok for corporations to treat people like they are disposable  and take away their livelihood in exchange for long term profits
[4:49:28] Badasti: @happyheals Blizzard was laying off heaps of staff long before MS came along
[4:49:30] goesidd: @raeza444 short term profits*
[4:49:41] wowsuomi: All my activision shares got bought back last year and now it doesn't exist anymore
[4:49:44] raeza444: quarterly reports gotta look good!
[4:49:49] happyheals: yeah but it is fun to see people get uptight
[4:49:52] MaximumnNeo: @Badasti i agree, my point is that people think that Investors are just the mega rich assholes like Elon Musk.  When in reality the majority of investors are in fact regular people through pensions and such
[4:50:05] happyheals: I never disagreed with anyone lol
[4:50:08] kashimofr: skillcapped new tier list for best 3s comps
[4:50:14] MaximumnNeo: now that is generally different with IPO's, but not for a company like microsoft
[4:50:18] Ignite_CLO: casually doin 115k dps
[4:50:27] JNE14: @happyheals I think it needed to be hostile. Actition had a lot of vices
[4:50:36] happyheals: I do too
[4:50:54] wackpoetic: MaximumnNeo i think most people agree with your premise on ownership/investors; but disagree with your conclusion on who makes the business decisions
[4:50:58] zirstro: I believe!
[4:51:06] raeza444: wizards vs melee cleave who wins
[4:51:09] Alerothan: @wackpoetic This
[4:51:34] raeza444: god i love this song
[4:51:38] Badasti: @MaximumnNeo I don't think anyone claimed 'only billionaires', thats just semantics. People typically mean the people who hold the most influence over the direction of a business
[4:52:08] MaximumnNeo: @wackpoetic well sure, i agree, but business decisions are made to benefit those people, not just mega rich. Thats my point. Shareholders are just people not some evil Conglomerate
[4:52:11] happyheals: I just got back in country about 9 days ago. I have been expanding my contracting firm. I need to stay up to date on U.S. Investments
[4:52:26] Badasti: and I can promise you me investing $1000 in S&P500 doesnt mean i have any influence over big tech
[4:52:46] raeza444: how dare that melee play D he should be straight O
[4:52:52] MaximumnNeo: no indiviually, but the companies you buy will make decisions that benefit you, but are not great for others
[4:53:00] MaximumnNeo: with your 1000 bucks
[4:53:07] Rissla: Damn Arcane looks so much fun in the hands of some1 who can play it. Never got the hang of it.
[4:53:15] wyldeshock: this guy in my rbg is honor lvl 1771
[4:53:20] laalaaland22: one shot one kill Kappa
[4:53:28] happyheals: Even when I would buy a hefty chunk of a small company , all you do is listen in on divedend information and earnings reports
[4:53:42] JNE14: @venruki  show us the mage finesse  of a blizzcon champ
[4:53:43] happyheals: occasional votes
[4:53:48] raeza444: sir just say u value money over people and call it a day
[4:54:05] raeza444: damn wizards lost
[4:54:06] happyheals: I value wow and BBLs
[4:54:07] gaulois62: bro that give me zero want to play the game lol
[4:54:08] c0gnusTV: same DH that went 6-0 before i think
[4:54:15] zeref_qq: song name?
[4:54:23] raeza444: crush pendulum
[4:54:58] heymomimonttv: what if there's DH bots too but they're harder to tell because DH playstyle already erratic af
[4:55:23] Alerothan: @heymomimonttv DH isnt a good spec to bot I wouldnt thinkm because of all the movement and stuff
[4:55:40] raeza444: the haymaker!
[4:55:44] raeza444: knock that mf out@
[4:55:45] happyheals: I feel like somewhere along the talking someone took me for the guy that was arguing before
[4:55:54] phinez_: there'll be bots of everyclass somewhere i imagine
[4:55:54] happyheals: I was just being a smart ass
[4:56:15] raeza444: observer deep fried ur shit my god

[5:08:20] flyingorangee: KEKW probably it not that profitable what a suprise with overwatch league and whole overwatch 2 etc
[5:08:24] wackpoetic: I mean that makes sense consider how the OWL went
[5:08:24] chachio_dk: Thats cap. They just launched the Overwatch Champions Series. no shot 7 people are running that
[5:08:31] Badasti: M$ might have events teams that they will outsource to... At least I suspect they would
[5:09:09] Mhortai: @chachio_dk Some of the people layed off will get replaced by people Xbox wants to put in those positions.
[5:09:15] maybethistimepls: next up: VENRUKI, SUPATEASE AND ZIQO WILL SOON BE LAID OFF FOR AI COMMENTATORS
[5:09:15] b1vcksheep: I mean when it comes down to blizz esports everything is ran by 3rd party's now besides WoW
[5:09:59] Mhortai: @b1vcksheep Wow is largely run by contracted individuals though. Most of them don't even worked directly for Blizzard.
[5:10:08] wackpoetic: I'll be the old grandpa and say it. Blizzard esports was best when it was the SC2 days and the main tournaments were Dreamhack/ESL/GSL
[5:10:23] maybethistimepls: our new blizzard president is puttin in that WORK kappa

[5:10:53] b1vcksheep: Oh I didn't know that. Yeah with Sc2, OW, and the other games I thought WoW was still ran by blizz
[5:11:18] Mhortai: @b1vcksheep Nope, most of the team is contracted via GCD still.
[5:11:21] Mhortai: I think
[5:11:50] Mhortai: Like Ven, Eiya etc are contracted for each event.
[5:11:58] wackpoetic: I mean it's much easier to contract a venruki to cast your AWC games than it is to hire and retain employees
[5:12:13] The_Twick: venruki is casting my wedding!
[5:12:14] psychic241: sing it, venruki cash

[5:41:34] The_Twick: interesting @DKgrips sounds like it is trying to average your MMR between last season and your current rating. I dunno the mmr system is wack. I played on my alt war who has 0 games and my first 2s game was 1900 mmr rating....
[5:41:40] xDamageincorporatedx: What version of Omnibar is Ven using? I can't seem to get mine to load in SS

[5:59:52] The_Twick: yeah @nesqalope how dare people judge me based off the things i say and how i act. Why can't they judge me based off the made up person i created for myself in my head?
[6:00:01] modsbruto: everyone but crusader is
[6:00:01] happyheals: People act like they have never raged before
[6:00:09] famous1939: solid joe impression

[6:02:40] DaneDillon: Technically you can prime sub on mobile but you have to open twitch in a browser.

[6:02:58] nesqalope: @mckizz exactly man
[6:03:04] The_Twick: how am i supposed to judge you... if not by the things you say and do?
[6:03:37] happyheals: @SteLawBro I agree, I was putting in that random church lady comment about minding your p's and q's
[6:03:39] The_Twick: only children say words just for reactions and expect nobody to judge them based off of it
[6:04:10] Kymagez: how do you get 489 crafted gear? ?
[6:04:11] Moobot: Latest video "Blizzard Just Revealed Massive Changes Coming In Phase 2 of Season of Discovery" view it here: youtu.be/SBM1eNeUFd8
[6:04:29] The_Twick: thought it only went to 486? @Kymagez you know something special?
[6:04:36] happyheals: Some of those kids grow up to be adults who say bad words for attention.
[6:04:37] The_Twick: tell me your secrets
[6:04:39] oliveoilbro: is this normal for meele dps in soloshuffle to do around 100k dps?

[6:04:56] Kymagez: just looking at drustvar and mvq has 489 stuff
[6:04:57] nesqalope: It's all about education and intentions i believe
[6:05:04] Ziqoftw: priest dog of the lob angle

[6:05:39] happyheals: happyheals gifted a Tier 1 sub to TwitchPrime! They have given 22 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[6:05:53] idiot_63: @TwitchPrime HUHH
[6:05:55] The_Twick: again it is very self-centered and disconnected from reality to say things and expect everyone to know YOUR intent. Shows a very selfish point of view. Every is judged based on their actions because.... what else are we supposed to judge you on?
[6:06:12] The_Twick: everyone*. anywho im done with this convo, sorry
[6:06:13] Kymagez: @The_Twick  huh?

[6:07:48] aaggros: you dont, only 486 crafted
[6:07:54] The_Twick: kk

[6:11:56] happyheals: Trophy of conquest can be put into gear when crafted or recrafted. At the conquest vendor on the first page you can get trophies that mage gear types
[6:11:58] Kymagez: like how do i get those 489 pieces
[6:12:11] The_Twick: to be fair @Kymagez crafting orders can be confusing if you dont know how it works. I had to look up a few videos to learn and have a buddy stream for me and teach me too
[6:12:11] happyheals: they cost conquest
[6:12:34] Kymagez: @The_Twick yeah i did then realised the vid i watched was old lol

[6:13:12] Kymagez: @DaneDillon my pieces unlike the pvp dont say that they go up in pvp though
[6:13:15] The_Twick: i feel you... so much updating to the game @Kymagez
[6:13:19] happyheals: it appears to you as a lower ilvl though
[6:13:32] Kymagez: does it still?
[6:13:35] 0hlando: dont you need those verdant conquest things to add to it?
[6:13:42] chirsen: the lob dog

[6:13:48] chirsen: hopefully not
[6:13:50] chirsen: XD <3
[6:13:56] The_Twick: yaya you can use the verdant patches to upgrade crafted gear to scale to 489 in pvp
[6:14:00] likeewlock: u have 57 sup to venruik and never saw how he crafted gear ?

[6:14:38] Kymagez: sorry, i miss just buying my fkin gear and playing, not having to know how to make a souffle just to gear

[6:37:51] Contaminated101: ^
[6:37:52] JustTaki: at least he's the 18th rated warrior on Mythic +
[6:37:58] ferahgok: my feral just laughs at the tweet. i don't wanna hear down bad
[6:37:58] zachgamegodx: dh outlaw god tier ret strong
[6:38:06] krome2dadome: warr really does feel rough rn. seems like only win condition is mana a lot of the time
[6:38:07] bollskis: hes only been rank 1 for a decade what does he know
[6:38:22] nerdyorc_: war is rough right now
[6:38:31] zachgamegodx: he’s been known to exaggerate a tad like the rest of us
[6:38:36] JustTaki: well the lego gives warrior an extra charge
[6:38:43] The_Twick: remove the damage buff from deep wounds and just build it into the kit
[6:38:45] FlyFYI: hes just speaking for top of the ladder
[6:38:50] Kymagez: true i am
[6:38:50] oxy4real: hunters are mortal
[6:38:52] 0hlando: do i have any chance of becoming rank one without a mouse with 40 buttons
[6:38:54] The_Twick: why do i need to mortal strike something, to do more damage with my mortal strike?
[6:39:00] Badasti: I'm fine with them making mages easier to kill but they need to tone down melee mobility
[6:39:00] nikthevoker: they fucked this game up
[6:39:00] krome2dadome: would be sick if MS did any damage at all
[6:39:02] nerdyorc_: is war bad or does DH and Outlaw just what you do better?
[6:39:04] skyestormz: blizz can never balance DH due to their design. spend most of their time OP
[6:39:08] FlyFYI: boomy
[6:39:16] Kymagez: @nikthevoker they took our jobs :(
[6:39:16] dolby24j: blink on stun is stupid, rogue with bubble as talent is stupid
[6:39:17] Juewellez: just make every class op
[6:39:18] Panndazs: sub does not need 2 vanishes or a talent that reduces either other cds
[6:39:20] willie_stroker_99: Buff druid
[6:39:27] kand1nsky: time they start pruning again :)
[6:39:30] foxypala: Hi all
[6:39:35] xilyx2: @zachgamegodx yea.. @'ing devs and asking for class help is kinda eh
[6:39:38] runups: will you try and cast some of the open games from other ppls twitch?
[6:39:40] Swingingwilly: to many slows in the game
[6:39:41] zachgamegodx: but @venruki one thing I do like this expac is they really toned down the self healing like from enhance and boomkin/feral, even mage with triune ward
[6:39:41] mvqq: 295 raiders from mvqq have joined! 
[6:39:43] nikthevoker: @Kymagez whats a job LUL
[6:39:52] Kymagez: living in pain

[6:40:08] Msv2: GL!
[6:40:11] asenku11k: <3
[6:40:15] zachgamegodx: it feels good that if someone overextends they can’t top themselves from 0 until damp
[6:40:18] Badasti: batman himself in the awc huh
[6:40:19] zirstro: <3 <3 <3
[6:40:22] Lemurion1: maldiva was banned again? What did he do this time?
[6:40:34] Kymagez: lol
[6:40:35] Mhortai: @Lemurion1 He was never reinstated
[6:40:40] mthgold: dude, I thought that was a fat drakthyr for a second KEKW
[6:40:44] Mephitics: can you link your warriors talents?
[6:40:51] venruki: BcEAfuKaizEAgP2qANDB2hmf7DgWCJRCJJalSSAAAAABRiAJBFR0gIkEKSESIARCAAAAAAAAJplICIENEA
[6:40:54] The_Twick: i dunno i think war needs all of the "do this to do this to buff your mortal strike to buff your damage from deep wounds to buff your mortal strike" is just like...... lame
[6:40:59] Luigicamp: oh look, it's a very rare "kym as kym"
[6:41:00] The_Twick: just build all the %damage into the build
[6:41:10] Mephitics: ty!
[6:41:12] Badasti: warrior talent logic - Does dam? Take. Doesn't do dam? don't take
[6:41:13] Kymagez: >.<
[6:41:17] Kymagez: ok luigo
[6:41:22] diperna99: is monk any good right now?
[6:41:26] zachgamegodx: I noticed that shadow priests are overly tanky into classes that crit with that blessed recovery talent that heals 20% of all physical crits
[6:41:31] nikthevoker: kym didnt sing me happy birthday this weekend! IM SAD! LUL
[6:41:45] alrajhio: clever name
[6:41:45] Kymagez: me sing ?
[6:41:48] zachgamegodx: they should nerf that
[6:41:53] Swingingwilly: no uptime
[6:41:55] Panndazs: 45 min solo shuffle q... poggers
[6:41:59] Kymagez: god thats like stevie nicks but worse
[6:42:01] Luigicamp: @nikthevoker Happy Belated Birthday!
[6:42:03] Msv2: =o
[6:42:05] galdinator: monk cc is kinda trash
[6:42:07] krome2dadome: same with warr XD
[6:42:12] Swingingwilly: just waddle
[6:42:13] The_Twick: problem with monk is fists of fury and hoe much they need to crutch on that ability to kill
[6:42:15] Kymagez: @nikthevoker but happy bday mate <3

[6:42:36] Badasti: non fat milk LUL
[6:42:39] Stoichulk: Warriors problem is it is not paladin?
[6:42:40] Badasti: some of these names
[6:42:46] nikthevoker: its like kickin a whoopie cushion
[6:43:10] gaulois62: those queue time are outrageous
[6:43:28] Panndazs: yeah sitting 45min q
[6:43:40] Kymagez: ehh the female version looked better
[6:43:44] nikthevoker: we  need kym in some shuffles
[6:43:58] CabinetMistake: bring back femmebooshka
[6:44:06] wow_revan: @venruki Do u think Blizards should rewrite Evoker ? I mean some spels are completelly useless, Cdew point alot of issues for healer and for DPS.  Shroud is completelly useless vs rogue for instance.
[6:44:06] nikthevoker: i can see him and gnomobility chasing each other
[6:44:16] Kymagez: @nikthevoker i do , as a dh named elliotvenczel just trolling ppl :)
[6:44:20] gaulois62: after are working day the last thing i want is to waste 30 minutes queue to play a game lol... one of the biggest issues that keep player playing
[6:44:22] nikthevoker: sunday ya, just another day LUL
[6:44:38] nikthevoker: @Kymagez would be legendary]
[6:44:55] Kymagez: i dont use addons etc so its :) bad
[6:45:01] comfyslayer: game is pretty well balanced, with th exception of a few outliers that make the rest feel like they are doing less
[6:45:07] pwntrd: cyclone is op against everyone though
[6:45:07] madoxstudios: I mean, a boomkin is technically a beast lol
[6:45:08] Swingingwilly: yet shroud is op vs warrior
[6:45:08] shredder1111: they saw the weaknesses of having a melee healer so added shroud but it's just hard countered by a lot of stuff
[6:45:09] CabinetMistake: Pog my queen
[6:45:13] madoxstudios: should be sheepable
[6:45:15] krome2dadome: what is warr good into?
[6:45:23] nikthevoker: i think theres a pally named elliotvencel too, just need him in the same lobby too
[6:45:31] wladqz: would game be better with rogues in game or deleted completely? or reworked that you don't have 4 sec stun on entire team every 20 sec
[6:45:32] columbian_vac: yepp main reason why I started to play healer dont got time for those ques
[6:45:35] zachgamegodx: undispellable shroud that works like adaptation on only ccs 5 seconds or more would be cool
[6:45:38] Kymagez: yeah i met him lol
[6:45:41] zachgamegodx: so u can cheese it out with micros
[6:45:48] Nachofez: anyone gets hella anxious while in a shuffle?
[6:45:56] Nachofez: or is it only me
[6:46:09] CabinetMistake: the shakes are the best thing to work on overcoming to improve i think
[6:46:18] kand1nsky: no rogue likes to waste 3 stuns into shroud I would not call it useless
[6:46:35] bollskis: @Nachofez hi papi
[6:46:36] wow_revan: Shroud is currently 66% they forgot to balance it. Does not work at 100% i mean
[6:46:36] zachgamegodx: outlaw doesnt care
[6:46:37] shredder1111: saps..
[6:46:39] Cvarks: or they have spellsteal on their team!
[6:46:39] shredder1111: yea
[6:46:40] nikthevoker: 3 stuns is nothing
[6:46:48] The_Twick: anyone else think shadowy duel is bullshit?
[6:46:49] malvarcla: cdew played against a rogue that would duel and cheap shot 3 times to get rid of stun
[6:46:51] zachgamegodx: triple cheapshot takes 3s and you have 30s vanish
[6:46:52] nikthevoker: just 3 globals
[6:46:59] malvarcla: shroud*
[6:47:00] Kymagez: i want to see if i can get to 2k no addons or macros, at 281 ms :)
[6:47:07] Drathimos: shroud should be undispellable since its already so easy to spam cc through it
[6:47:09] The_Twick: i believe in you @Kymagez
[6:47:13] Kymagez: i dont
[6:47:17] Swingingwilly: what’s a warrior to do
[6:47:23] Kymagez: buying that ele bot
[6:47:42] CabinetMistake: how long ago was that?
[6:47:43] XilliumStorm: rogues need less CC
[6:47:48] laalaaland22: yep it was the end of rogues
[6:47:48] kreyzy8: cdew has moved onto tweeting about arcane mage
[6:47:52] Kymagez: thought i did but just got sent an overpriced box of cookies
[6:48:04] zachgamegodx: Cdew is enjoying an arcane mage rn
[6:48:08] chrisiirc: it is a long time
[6:48:13] likeewlock: community goes crazy with armor changes aswell and what happend
[6:48:22] The_Twick: i think the fix to rogues is remove shadowy duel, at least smoke bomb has movement counterplay to it
[6:48:25] Mhortai: Not sure if you gave an opinion on this, but do you like the fear changes @venruki ? Seems a little OP consider the classes with fear have talents that also extend the damage it takes before breaking. Seems a little much now.
[6:48:27] Lemurion1: what was your team and comp back then?
[6:48:27] Kymagez: wasnt she a kid when you met her?

[6:52:28] zachgamegodx: @venruki Player versus Player Iridal, the Earth’s Master damage-on use-effect now deals 10% of its damage (was 30%) in PvP combat. Death Knight Unholy Resolved an issue causing Outbreak to not apply Virulent Plague to enemy totems, Psyfiend, and Observer. the 2nd change is actually really big for dks

[6:53:19] bullox87: Crazy I only liked 10 mins to get the grim campfire and missed it lol wild

[6:57:03] Mhortai: @venruki not sure if you know the answer to this, but does insurance in Canada cover medical marijuana? In the use it doesn't because it's still federally illegal. Or anyone from Canada could answer that I guess.
[6:57:15] Mhortai: in the US rather
[6:57:38] Luigicamp: @Kymagez I got Swiss and Italian residency, I probably beat ya in that department
[6:57:42] treggerpleb: Is your UI default blizzard? Just returning and hard to tell apart from addons anymore @venruki

[6:58:42] Kymagez: @stilljane tell my dad to call me pls
[6:59:10] Mhortai: @leeka Well medical (at least in the US) you had doctor approval to use it. In some states it's the only way you can get it, and in some states no doctors want to do it, and some would even get fired if they did.
[6:59:20] Kymagez: @Luigicamp papa can you hear me
[6:59:29] Kymagez: :)

[7:01:33] david_v_goldberg: warrior o0

[7:02:16] magnusz: why'd u msg me rip bro
[7:02:17] magnusz: what hap
[7:02:29] mixlife: why are warlocks harder to kill than plate wearers
[7:02:33] krome2dadome: @magnusz he was reading twitter
[7:02:33] gorilladude13: I think we should ask Mag how good is war atm..he will tell u :)
[7:02:50] magnusz: oh
[7:02:58] Mhortai: @gorilladude13 We already covered his opinion a few times LOL
[7:03:03] magnusz: yea warriors uh, lol
[7:03:18] Bigvuqoffdam: ignore pain!!
[7:03:21] gorilladude13: "warriors lol" says it all
[7:03:32] magnusz: ignore pain stealth changed and nerfed !! op !
[7:03:46] reyou_senpai: sucks playing warrior  right now even tho i love it you do everything right and give 120% and your so called suffle allys do bs or troll

[7:04:09] Bigvuqoffdam: rallying cry! super safe button!
[7:04:13] symbolism369: @chrisiirc all melee
[7:04:19] chrisiirc: especially warriors
[7:04:20] Moobot: Latest video "Blizzard Just Revealed Massive Changes Coming In Phase 2 of Season of Discovery" view it here: youtu.be/SBM1eNeUFd8
[7:04:21] chrisiirc: i hate them
[7:04:24] The_Twick: make rallying cry a 2 min cd
[7:04:26] The_Twick: imo
[7:04:26] 0hlando: rally saves u from like 1 chaos bolt
[7:04:33] krome2dadome: Ignore Pain renamed to Embrace the Pain. Now sacrifices 25% of your hp and causes you to take 10% more damage.
[7:04:42] The_Twick: lmao @krome2dadome
[7:04:46] Koraszdormu: This MW is kinda sketch...
[7:05:25] reyou_senpai: what a troll like i said a sec ago you give 120% mean while -_-
[7:07:20] prtwentyfour: dont forget to do some prevolker please and ty. Stuck at 1650's -1700 rating
[7:07:25] Swingingwilly: lobbies like this fell forced to hit destro or he just does to much dmg

[7:07:42] The_Twick: just dont play the game 5head
[7:07:47] reyou_senpai: 100
[7:07:49] The_Twick: yeah
[7:07:53] The_Twick: gotta get your PAWS ON THEM
[7:07:56] kasieus: i dont want to drop my books or break my glasses
[7:07:59] peeachy8: amen
[7:08:00] gorilladude13: ya that+s super hard to explain to ppl in shufle..they want chill back
[7:08:01] magnusz: warrior is the most rage inducing class to play
[7:08:02] DjRio: warrior super fun rn
[7:08:05] gilgameshxt: Play shaman
[7:08:18] eainzsp: the dichotomy of warriors
[7:08:23] willie_stroker_99: Play ww
[7:08:26] BetterknownasJohn: ww in to wizards is miserable
[7:08:28] Koraszdormu: My buddy and I are doing WW/MW in 2's, and we're climbing decently enough.
[7:08:29] krome2dadome: @magnusz @DjRio this back to back is too funny
[7:08:29] Washedupspoon: i feel like ww  die  always
[7:08:29] eddiehamster: do u have tips to last longer in bed ?
[7:08:31] wow_revan: Press it :)
[7:08:34] wow_revan: Evokerrrrr
[7:08:34] The_Twick: @magnusz what would you change about war, i think deep wounds mastery is hella lame, just add that damage into the kit. Why do we need to mortal strike to do more damage with mortal strike lul
[7:08:36] chrisiirc: when warriors are good they ruin the game so....
[7:08:40] deepTTV: :)
[7:08:41] tv_raz: ww is the worst by far into wizards
[7:08:43] Itankarenas: no lego on my ret Sadge
[7:08:47] Axtin: play feral :)
[7:08:48] magnusz: doesnt matter what id change bro they aint gon do it
[7:08:51] DjRio: @chrisiirc eh i think you mean rogues my guy
[7:08:54] Swingingwilly: I play resto shaman and fury warrior pretty sure I must secretly love the rage
[7:08:54] KORVENDALLAS: Play rogue or mage!
[7:08:58] reyou_senpai: iv had so many games while pugin and ppl bitch cus im atacking the wrong target  like its cus the target is out of range of corse im going to hit the closest guy
[7:09:00] Abruty: an ability that chain a target to them for 1-3 sec
[7:09:03] wow_revan: Now we talking :) Greenlizard :)
[7:09:07] pugulus_prime: Just do what they did to paladins and give them 20 yard range
[7:09:08] zachgamegodx: couldnt make it any easier to play KEKW
[7:09:14] ForsakenTV3: blood dk lol
[7:09:17] michele1090: like a dh ?
[7:09:17] peeachy8: I had a lock say my damage was garbage. They also didn't want me to push in. lost the round :(. I went up against him and my healer said to push,. doubled his damage and won the round
[7:09:19] happyheals: specs should do less damage the more they have in their toolkit
[7:09:20] The_Twick: warrior requires too many "do this to do this, to do this other thing, to buff this abilty, and then you can do some damage now that all your bleeds are up, maybe"
[7:09:24] yowler_: imagine killing an outlaw rogue
[7:09:28] 0hlando: warriors need some javelin toss build
[7:09:29] mufaasa_fr: There IS a ww build to kill wizards
[7:09:33] BLOOKTROOP: give 4 more charges of heroic leap
[7:09:41] The_Twick: GIVE WARS AXE TOSS SPEC
[7:09:44] The_Twick: ranged war, lets go
[7:09:48] magnusz: ww's prob infuriating to play after the fear changes especially
[7:09:50] tv_raz: @mufaasa_fr killing the wizards isnt the problem its getting near them
[7:09:50] wow_revan: Uh
[7:10:03] lucksh20: how bad or balanced are the new armor changes in pvp? @venruki
[7:10:04] angelus1100: Did the drop end?
[7:10:17] magnusz: yea good 1 bro
[7:10:22] carbonzo_bean: scorpion
[7:10:22] zachgamegodx: they need a zerker rage of some kind
[7:10:23] shredder1111: maybe buff defensive stance and ignore pain would be a start, silly how rogues feel more tanky than wars
[7:10:29] Natan_Ntn: its street fighter no?
[7:10:30] carbonzo_bean: oh ur thinkin of dhal sim from street fighter
[7:10:30] Merkflare: no its street fighter
[7:10:31] Natan_Ntn: dhalsin
[7:10:32] reyou_senpai: scorpion?
[7:10:34] Shchoorw: problem with warrior is that if no uptime no damage since they nerfed all burst
[7:10:36] The_Twick: you talking about Dhalsm
[7:10:40] The_Twick: from street fighter
[7:10:42] turbsow: @venruki
[7:10:43] The_Twick: yeah i agree
[7:10:46] magnusz: yea im sure theres a lot of complete morons who dont agree with me
[7:10:48] DjRio: awc gonna be full of rogues
[7:10:50] The_Twick: stretch arms, ranged punching
[7:10:54] turbsow: is dev evoker that fun?
[7:10:59] The_Twick: i would love.... a ranged build for war
[7:11:00] Nachofez: i agree with you ven, as a ww player it sucks major ass to get ccd all game and not doing crap
[7:11:01] chrisiirc: diff opinion = complete moron lol
[7:11:03] goatskull123: lets make every class range
[7:11:06] goatskull123: why dont we
[7:11:07] zachgamegodx: how about Captain Falcon from Super Smash Brothers @venruki
[7:11:07] Koraszdormu: RMP gonna be 90% of the AWC teams.
[7:11:10] tv_raz: problem is all these classes use to have counters now that seems to have gone out the window
[7:11:11] magnusz: warrior is so op that blizo is only playing dh
[7:11:12] Swingingwilly: give me a hat to throw like king loa
[7:11:15] turbsow: im maining it in mplus, not as fun :D
[7:11:19] mufaasa_fr: @tv_raz go for windwalking in the tree, go for windwaker PvP and ride the wind
[7:11:20] wow_revan: @venruki well evoker is with most poor range .. 25y. it will be good it was 30..
[7:11:22] turbsow: frustrating rather
[7:11:33] Swingingwilly: kung lao
[7:11:39] chrisiirc: god forbid warrior sits one out for the first time in a billion years
[7:11:40] Badasti: thats also true
[7:11:40] magnusz: yea i mean if u cant figure out how to simply just walk away from the warrior class
[7:11:41] chrisiirc: wah wah wah
[7:11:44] magnusz: the bigger man strategy, i call it
[7:11:56] tv_raz: i was promised games with toxxybolts wheres that clown
[7:12:12] The_Twick: but
[7:12:18] The_Twick: war is life
[7:12:25] magnusz: reading this chris guy type is like impressive
[7:12:25] The_Twick: rage is the worst and best resource in the gaame
[7:12:40] atoker: when I dual wield my black out kick is 22k and when I use a 2h it's 23k
[7:12:45] leeka: i miss awc stats
[7:12:53] beastnephew3: I miss the spear build and big mortal strikes for warrior :(. it was so fun back then I hate rends and bleeds
[7:12:53] magnusz: i can do it right now if u want
[7:12:56] magnusz: its gonna be
[7:12:58] tv_raz: off work again tomorrow dope
[7:13:01] magnusz: rogue/tank spec/x
[7:13:09] Mhortai: @leeka :(
[7:13:10] leeka: lol
[7:13:12] The_Twick: qpop!
[7:13:14] yeeezies: yeeezies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[7:13:15] asenku11k: lol
[7:13:24] magnusz: whens the last time warrior even won a cup
[7:13:29] Koraszdormu: 90% RMP, then GG running RSham.  And the EU teams we might see a MW.
[7:13:30] leeka: they always said they would give me shoutouts on broadcast and never did :(
[7:13:30] magnusz: when bush was in office?
[7:13:31] Badasti: I am curious which sidekick class will get to paly with Rogues this time
[7:13:41] tv_raz: you are 4/6 im 5/6 xD
[7:13:43] happyheals: this year at ya mamas house
[7:13:44] Vendrek: Warrior into caster comp is still doing good...it is a lot more painful going into outlaw rogue and ret paladins
[7:13:45] Telarius1: dh ele apparently not nearly as good since rdru mana nerfs.
[7:13:46] lucksh20: sad time
[7:13:47] magnusz: sl s1
[7:13:50] mufaasa_fr: 2014 blizzcon
[7:13:55] The_Twick: TSG back in WOTLK when nobody knew how to deal with it prob @magnusz
[7:14:03] The_Twick: now TSG is mid a f in wotlk
[7:14:11] magnusz: warrior is dogshit into any caster that doesnt manually breathe irl
[7:14:11] lucksh20: 2014 blizzcon LSD 2.0 won
[7:14:19] zachgamegodx: according to Ozz on twitter, ele is the worst caster IN THE GAME
[7:14:22] lucksh20: 2015 was warrior win
[7:14:23] galdinator: warrior isnt a class meant for people who play at the top level, that's why they haven't won
[7:14:25] zachgamegodx: no cap on god ..vibez
[7:14:30] galdinator: If you put any mage player on a warrior it would win awc easilyt
[7:14:37] mufaasa_fr: Didnt joefernandes win ?
[7:14:46] lucksh20: yeah on 2015
[7:14:50] lucksh20: turbo op
[7:14:51] fistweaveurnan: Ven outlaw is disgusting but DH is worse just played a double dh/outlaw lobby at 2360, the outlaw was the only viable KT outside of healers. DH is immortla does more damage than any other spec
[7:15:03] fistweaveurnan: Also the reason DH/ret is a viable 3s comp at 2800 right now
[7:15:27] Telarius1: dh isnt as tanky as outlaw, maybe im fried tho
[7:15:29] Telarius1: @fistweaveurnan
[7:15:41] magnusz: dh isnt even in the same universe in terms of tankiness that outlaw is
[7:15:54] fistweaveurnan: @Telarius1 Maybe not too double meele but the second you bring in 1 caster they are tankier
[7:15:55] magnusz: guys smokin diapers
[7:16:10] The_Twick: blizz should make stealth like how it should be, vanish dont remove dots and you cant be stealthed during bleeds/dots
[7:16:13] lucksh20: @magnusz are you competing this year or?
[7:16:24] lucksh20: would love to see you compete fr fr
[7:16:25] magnusz: naw dont reckon
[7:16:30] magnusz: my class is soggy wet dogshit
[7:16:38] lucksh20: true
[7:16:39] mufaasa_fr: Outlaw still les scary than Sub and assa
[7:16:39] chrisiirc: no spec in the game should be tankier than a warrior.
[7:16:41] magnusz: might compete at the damn unemployment line like im in fuckin 8 mile
[7:16:42] Telarius1: @fistweaveurnan i dont tihnk u understand dh. its very tanky into double melee. and huge free dam
[7:16:42] fistweaveurnan: @magnusz Prob not to warrior, dh is immortal with 1 caster in lobby
[7:16:53] Telarius1: @fistweaveurnan u die to double wizards tho
[7:17:05] fistweaveurnan: DH has a near 20% passive wall against casters
[7:17:11] fistweaveurnan: if talented otherwise 15%
[7:17:18] The_Twick: just nerf dh dmg by like 15% for pvp
[7:17:23] The_Twick: call it a day
[7:17:41] 0hlando: delete demon hunters and say whoopsie
[7:17:41] dvoraklol: DANG IT
[7:17:51] Badasti: LUL
[7:17:57] flyingorangee: @magnusz Sadge
[7:18:03] happyheals: YOU SHOULDA PUT A RING ON IT
[7:18:07] shredder1111: if u nerf dh then rogue is the only viable melee class
[7:18:18] happyheals: stupid caps
[7:18:18] Telarius1: @fistweaveurnan  do u think a 15% passive make u immportant vs magic.
[7:18:20] Badasti: team mates job is to wave candles with tears in their eyes
[7:18:30] Itankarenas: fist bump jesus? Pog
[7:18:42] Telarius1: immortal*
[7:18:48] Itankarenas: Yeah, but then he won't have it next round
[7:18:49] prtwentyfour: Link to your Build?
[7:18:53] Nachofez: are we getting ruki after dark tonight¡¡
[7:18:59] The_Twick: WHERE WERE YOU HEALER? YOU CANT HEAL ME WHEN IM LOS OF YOU AND STUNNED OUT OF RANGE OMGGGG < that DH prob
[7:19:02] reyou_senpai: i feel like how they fix war  would be to mabe give us 1 extra charge or a H leap  alot of are issue is we are very prone to snares  theres prolly a better way to balance are dmg up to every one else but i think we might be ok if we can stay on ppl more just my opinion
[7:19:06] Itankarenas: HEALS??
[7:19:07] Badasti: not even Beyonce can overcome that IQ deficit
[7:19:10] flyingorangee: PartyParrot
[7:19:14] chrisiirc: @reyou_senpai HELL FUCKING NO
[7:19:21] chrisiirc: 2 lines in and its a no
[7:19:32] Nifkin420: !drops

[7:19:35] Msv2: What was that video called with the demonhunter singing and the healer sweating?
[7:19:36] 0hlando: make thunder clap a root break
[7:19:57] reyou_senpai: you clearly dont play war
[7:20:04] Alerothan: @Msv2 Healers vs melee in solo shuffle
[7:20:07] likeewlock: 2 extra charge kekw u kidding
[7:20:12] likeewlock: 1
[7:20:14] Msv2: Tyvm!!
[7:20:17] Msv2: poor ruki
[7:20:23] Bigvuqoffdam: tbh intervene giving spell reflect to ally was a cool interaction
[7:20:25] The_Twick: the way to fix war is remove all the "do this to buff your damage" nonsense. Overpower charged to make MS stronger, build that into the kit, period. Execute making MS stronger? Build that into the kit. Deep wounds needing to be applied to do more damage and it can fall off? No. Just build that damage into the kit. Make actually being hit by an arms war scaary
[7:20:46] dolby24j: lmao healing 100% more than the other healer
[7:20:51] dolby24j: no pressure at all
[7:21:03] lucksh20: skill issue
[7:21:05] lucksh20: Kappa
[7:21:09] mufaasa_fr: Lol arms do a lot of damage u guys coping
[7:21:25] Intravz: DH just doing dh things
[7:21:31] reyou_senpai: like i said
[7:21:50] atoker: warriors used to chunk in older expacs
[7:22:12] lucksh20: bring back mop warr pls
[7:22:13] 0hlando: shadowlands warrior was the most fun ive had in a game in a while
[7:22:15] mufaasa_fr: Avatar 20 sec / War breakef every 45 sec .. that's strong enough
[7:22:17] nikthevoker: @The_Twick every class is stacking modifiers
[7:22:41] wackpoetic: Warriors used to hit so hard with their globals that they would have to go .5 speed on a PvP video when they pressed Whirlwind because it would kill 3 different people
[7:22:44] kasieus: what do wizards even kill vs this
[7:22:46] kasieus: dh/lock
[7:22:49] shredder1111: war breaker is a joke compared to essence break
[7:22:58] tangell0s: 170k hps, everything still dead
[7:22:59] Intravz: chad lizard and greenlizard power
[7:23:02] WalleBrew: is it just me or does everyone in LFG pop have 2.6 XP lol
[7:23:13] aurelioristv: you're missing out on a lot of living flame healing
[7:23:14] WalleBrew: PVP*
[7:23:21] Badasti: sometimes it be like that
[7:23:24] kasieus: dh/lock too tanky vs frost/dev
[7:23:30] JFarm_: Do you think Pres is sleeper?
[7:23:33] Koraszdormu: Is this gonna be a skunk lobby for the Green Lizzie?  We hate to see it.
[7:23:34] aurelioristv: no flame ofc
[7:23:34] dickman911: lmao
[7:23:37] Intravz: @wallebrew only glads play now i guess
[7:23:47] bollskis: @mufaasa_fr literal best warrior in game disagrees but go off king
[7:24:10] 0hlando: ur not pressing ur buttons hard enough for stream to hear it thats whats going wrong
[7:24:11] kreyzy8: @WalleBrew its because they got it in SL when 2.6 was 1k rating below R1 lol
[7:24:18] mufaasa_fr: Ofc he'll disagree
[7:24:56] aurelioristv: you said it first focus on yourself you can't influence others, ofc it's not your fault for the losses, my intention wasn't that, just a friendly tip
[7:25:38] wackpoetic: aurelioristv pretty sure ven is playing Flow State instead of the Living Flame build anyway
[7:25:42] Malte_L: 1Heal?
[7:25:43] kreyzy8: Sadge
[7:25:48] aurelioristv: ohh I see
[7:25:52] Malte_L: Just 1 man Kappa
[7:25:54] JFarm_: I know its looking bad this round. How is pres right now?
[7:26:05] bighandslol: didnt see living flame healing
[7:26:20] Badasti: he gonna bring home the dub for you i believe
[7:26:31] Badasti: he will not let this shaman go unchallenged
[7:27:58] aurelioristv: KEKW aff lock dmg
[7:28:01] deepTTV: must need 250k+
[7:28:05] Intravz: is that Sarena chat?
[7:28:20] galdinator: "sarena updated by sammers"
[7:28:22] mufaasa_fr: Yes
[7:28:32] Intravz: ty
[7:28:52] Kikrino: Watching this makes me never wanna try healing tbh
[7:28:53] JFarm_: How is pres right now? sleeper or nah? 200k hps holy frick.
[7:28:55] lucksh20: Beyonce is pumping
[7:28:56] Koraszdormu: I did 2's with my buddy yesterday on my Pres, and honestly, it feltbadman.  I was constantly stress healing.  Especially compared to my MW.
[7:28:57] tangell0s: I never understand how it's always the enemy team doing roughly triple your team's damage, in each round. Like this lock on your team does nothing, on the shaman's? 130k DPS. the DH? Popping off the entire time he's against you, only to do 60k dps in this one.
[7:29:03] Outer_Limitz: Sadge
[7:29:24] The_Twick: trying to keep our boy venruki down
[7:29:25] chipncheese: ive never seen a DH do s little damage before
[7:29:25] bruce_t_wayne: how the fuck does this even happen with double the hps whole game
[7:29:25] kreyzy8: we were so close to the 2.4 :(
[7:29:36] aurelioristv: just pres evo things
[7:29:36] Malte_L: happends. go again
[7:29:41] tangell0s: @bruce_t_wayne cuz enemy team doing double the DPS
[7:29:48] Swingingwilly: purge
[7:29:54] Telarius1: also as prev i tihnk gotta do aggro dam or u just lose
[7:29:59] wackpoetic: Pres HPS is also inflated in Details because it counts Time Dilation as healing
[7:30:05] Telarius1: cuz no cd for team that isnt healing being reduced by damp
[7:30:12] socbrotes: which class do you think is having the most fun right now?
[7:30:16] Telarius1: its why prev kinda stinky
[7:30:23] Malte_L: @bruce_t_wayne always full value 3x healing no ms
[7:30:23] The_Twick: warlock probably @Telarius1 and dh
[7:30:25] The_Twick: rogue too
[7:30:30] The_Twick: mage
[7:30:33] csmartypants: whats resto druid bad lobbies?
[7:30:34] chizzad52: gg's - Chadizard
[7:30:35] The_Twick: ret pally
[7:30:37] aurelioristv: next time just aoe dispel ua and get out of that lobby KEKW
[7:30:43] The_Twick: rdruid
[7:30:44] angelus1100: Is the drop still active?
[7:30:53] wackpoetic: I do like Aura Mastery vs Aff lock, you can jsut wall and dispel whenever you want
[7:30:53] kasieus: @wackpoetic but pres has no damage reduction like other healers that doesnt show up on details, would hardly call TD inflation
[7:30:56] B0ost3d: hard to heal a melee/caster like a bowling 7-10 split with dream breath
[7:30:59] tv_raz: same shaman not comp countered and go 6 and 0
[7:31:03] Koraszdormu: I really hope we see some MW in AWC this weekend.  People are sleepin' on MW.
[7:31:10] crymorre: GIGACHAD greenlizard
[7:31:11] Telarius1: TD isnt a damage reduction @kasieus  u take the full dam. Real reductions % remove the dam
[7:31:12] bannedonow2: man i was the dh that lobby first game on why tf am i getting flamed in the chat lmao
[7:31:12] aurelioristv: fist do be lookin strong
[7:31:18] angelus1100: @havenblood ah, I see.
[7:31:19] Swingingwilly: that’s 2 resto shaman 6-0 lobbies I’ve seen tonight
[7:31:21] kasieus: @Telarius1 reread what i said
[7:31:24] Telarius1: ya i saw
[7:31:27] Telarius1: i agree
[7:31:31] yippey_: yessss, Greenlizard
[7:31:35] shredder1111: fw maybe, no chance we see caster mw
[7:31:37] rembrandt89: im sure bank will play mw an meep
[7:31:40] Telarius1: prev cuz u have no real cd other than hps. U have to do dam
[7:31:46] Telarius1: flaw in its design
[7:31:49] Intravz: fist maybe, not casted
[7:31:49] ayesoh195: Mw is garbage
[7:31:50] Telarius1: for SS at leave
[7:31:52] fistweaveurnan: @Telarius1 I think I understand very well that DH is immortal
[7:31:54] Telarius1: least
[7:31:56] Malte_L: nice flex

[7:32:26] The_Twick: i honestly couldnt care was asmon thinks, he is the richest homeless person on the planet
[7:32:26] Luigicamp: how do you enforce it anyway? Go into people's discord and say "We said NO guys!"
[7:32:33] Malte_L: their so rare. you dont even see mw. their all above 2.7k Kappa
[7:32:34] whitecrox: GDKPs are awfull for the game
[7:32:42] Kymagez: lol
[7:32:46] bruce_t_wayne: new here enjoying the stream
[7:32:49] Tragictomb: asmongold has just been farming clicks for like the last month lol
[7:32:49] Mhortai: @Luigicamp They can track gold amounts swapped I know right now.
[7:32:55] bagofcans88: Usually a fan of Asmon but he had a video reacting to "why are millennials unhappy" and he totally missed the point
[7:32:57] Intravz: not gonna be able to trade gold in raids
[7:33:03] Tragictomb: he says controversial stuff just for the fun of it I think
[7:33:15] Malte_L: Meanwhile on retail ppl need on everything in raid and sell these items after 4Head
[7:33:28] morrs: people buy gold to buy GDKP and then sell gold ......
[7:33:29] trikkSP: no one forces you to do a gdkp, just raid with a guild
[7:33:31] Guidry: agree
[7:33:32] ayesoh195: But that world doesn't exsist
[7:33:32] kreyzy8: I do think banning GDKP's because they don't know how to handle gold farmer bots is pretty lame
[7:33:33] flandrs: everybody just buys gear from gold they bought
[7:33:37] kreyzy8: its the definition of a bandaid fix
[7:33:38] Mhortai: But you can buy gold.
[7:33:51] chipncheese: yep
[7:33:52] galdinator: GDKP is fun if everyone is legit
[7:33:52] Yaycarrots: peepoTalk
[7:33:53] Merkflare: i dislike anything that is anti MMO and being social
[7:34:00] nameyourform: W take
[7:34:03] chipncheese: i dont even like asmongold but this is correct
[7:34:05] Mhortai: There have been cases where people that run GDKP are also selling gold.
[7:34:07] The_Twick: asmon is a millionare homeless person, like literally the most out of touch takes. GDKP is against the social aspect of the game imo. Isnt hard to make pals and join a guild and raid if you arent' a horrible person. Which begs the question....
[7:34:08] Intravz: they need to ban leveling boosters too for gold

[7:34:39] The_Twick: plus why would anyone listen to asmon, he doesnt even play wow anymore
[7:34:44] 0hlando: why buy token for 25 when u can buy same amount for 15
[7:34:59] kreyzy8: @Omgdoom but GDKP's are still filled with people who buy gold
[7:35:04] kreyzy8: which is his point
[7:35:08] Mhortai: GDKP's also minimize raiding too. Also most players can't afford to do GDKP's without buying bold.
[7:35:08] Merkflare: that happens all the time in real life with EVERYTHING
[7:35:09] fistweaveurnan: @magnusz Why was a DH/ret comp farming at 2800 last night
[7:35:14] morrs: asmon is milking YouTube clips on a daily basis - personal opinion and nothing against him
[7:35:22] Mhortai: They do ban gold buyers....
[7:35:29] Mhortai: Except Sodapoppin LOL
[7:35:30] Luigicamp: it's not that easy to stop everyone from buying gold though. I think the token was not a bad idea.
[7:35:30] Swingingwilly: but he doesn’t even play the game
[7:35:31] Click_for_giggles: asmon deepfake
[7:35:35] The_Twick: yeah..... @morrs

[7:35:51] nairuatlhok: The military does stuff with that same logic. few people mess up everyone gets punished
[7:35:57] ImJordanHi: In an MMO with random drop rates, why would you ever be able to "buy gear" in a raid. It should just go to a random player, that's the way the game was designed
[7:35:59] tarth_100: lol people need to remember that game companies arent essential government services lol
[7:36:01] The_Twick: asom doesnt play the game, gets given tons of gold, he doesnt even have a realistic view on the game
[7:36:03] Dwilk20: What was that video about?
[7:36:06] Mhortai: @Luigicamp 100%
[7:36:11] FrenzyFusion: FrenzyFusion subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[7:36:11] Omgdoom: his entire sod guild is based around people buying gold and funnelling it to him to buy ranks
[7:36:18] Chubbydizz: there's nothing unsocial about gdkps if you're not talking about the degenerate ones with stupid gold costs where people rotate bought gold, most of them function basically like guild groups
[7:36:21] kreyzy8: I do think its funny that not only are they already having trouble dealing with gold buyers/sellers, but now they also have to enforce GDKPs KEKW
[7:36:27] tangell0s: GDKPs are a good system propped up by chinese gold farming
[7:36:32] Mhortai: GDKP's ruin raiding and ruin the market though.
[7:36:41] Chadww: it makes up for the shitty lot system they have in classic
[7:36:56] renae69: delusional take
[7:36:56] tarth_100: Would he be mad if blizz fixed gold botting and raised sub price to cover the cost of fixing that issue more consistently?
[7:37:01] The_Twick: i would like to see one person who has joined a gdkp without buying gold
[7:37:04] morrs: You PuG in a random schedule - but I legit know friends who buy tokens to get stuff by selling them
[7:37:07] flandrs: it encourages gold buying though
[7:37:10] Dimistarr: 50 dkp....MINUS!
[7:37:11] ImJordanHi: But having the "I don't have enough ttime to raid every thursday" although you'll be able to farm 3k gold for a wand?
[7:37:13] tangell0s: @The_Twick hi
[7:37:14] yippey_: I work 48 on 96 off, I can't meet a regular raid schedule, so I love GDKPs in order to experience content I otherwise wouldn't
[7:37:19] bagofcans88: Gdkp is cool, you don't need to participate
[7:37:22] Mhortai: I am interested how many people do you think do GDKPs?
[7:37:24] opisop032: great take
[7:37:24] Dimistarr: also more dots
[7:37:25] The_Twick: plus there are pugs, ive done fyraak H pugging so
[7:37:25] comfyslayer: You can't buy dkp with real life money
[7:37:25] fistweaveurnan: classic is so ass
[7:37:27] jeffgoldblumx: maybe blizz sees it as a chicken or the egg problem, people buy gold cuz of gdkp? idk
[7:37:28] Mhortai: Or can AFFORD to do them?
[7:37:30] shredder1111: it's not the same thing, the person with no time to raid isn't farming the gold himself, he's buying it hence why its p2w
[7:37:31] chrisiirc: its not about right or wrong its just people have different ways of playing the game
[7:37:34] xkayne: its for the majority not the minority
[7:37:34] ItsBees: Hype train Pog
[7:37:36] shinydunsparce: if you dont have time to raid, you dont have time to grind gold
[7:37:38] chipncheese: nothing feels worse then watching somene being dead on every fight then watching them win the roll on an item they SR'd that I wanted then watching it happen 3 weeks in a row
[7:37:40] renae69: because u will lose gear to people who have more irl money to afford gold
[7:37:45] gmar_07: this is prolly a trial run for the main game
[7:37:51] Axtin: its a good system created by players the only problem is you cant compete with people buying gold
[7:37:51] nuckAU: I'm ok with them doing ANYTHING to curb gold buying. This is the lazy way and it wont 100% solve it but im happy its happening <3
[7:37:53] Guidry: bruh rofl
[7:37:54] The_Twick: im just saying nobody gets thata much gold without being supported or enpowering gold buyers.
[7:37:59] trikkSP: hearing is hard LUL
[7:38:03] renae69: yea but u can buy gold
[7:38:05] The_Twick: i meana
[7:38:07] renae69: so ur take is terrible
[7:38:10] chipncheese: his brain is too small
[7:38:10] shinydunsparce: but you can buy gold
[7:38:11] whitecrox: But you can buy gold via tokens
[7:38:11] jacob_the_mage: This guy trolling you fun
[7:38:13] Luigicamp: That's why gdkp worked better in the old days when you didn't have players walking around in vanilla with 300k gold in their bags.
[7:38:15] ItsBees: @renae69 do you know what the word "if" means?
[7:38:21] aurelioristv: buying gold will never be addressed properly so they can just let people do what they want. Banning GDKPs won't solve anything people will just buy carries with their cheating gold
[7:38:24] chipncheese: he hears "GDKP" and his brain turns off
[7:38:24] seraph_wow: youre just a cook
[7:38:27] Extramediums: Fuck GDKP, cancer upon the game since it became popular, it's the wealthy helping the wealthy when the majority of that wealth was acquired in nefarious ways, and it encourages the continuation of buying gold from whatever source is available.
[7:38:27] Swingingwilly: but u can so it’s in unrealistic option
[7:38:27] seraph_wow: now go make some food
[7:38:29] trikkSP: @renae69 if you had a brain you would understand LUL
[7:38:30] Bigvuqoffdam: inb4 PERMA
[7:38:31] morrs: since buying gold is reality then by your own words GDKPs are bad
[7:38:32] Tragictomb: @axtin I think that’s the right idea - you can’t judge GDKPs outside of the reality that they’re filled with bought gold
[7:38:34] Davinciwowx: I also think GDKP is great, may be best sysyem if you are not in guild pushimg for world first
[7:38:37] jacob_the_mage: GDKP is such a bad system
[7:38:37] bagofcans88: Can someone who is against gdkp why it's bad? Why don't you just play with your friends and guild?
[7:38:41] Dwilk20: My answer to GDKP I just dont raid pve is a joke anyways lol
[7:38:43] Intravz: he’s a cook, tryna be a chef
[7:38:44] xkayne: yall should smell my fart
[7:38:45] rembrandt89: my retail raid does gdkp
[7:38:46] The_Twick: i agree @venruki if gold buying wasnt a thing. but it is.... which is borked
[7:38:48] shinydunsparce: A thing is perfect if B thing didn't exist
[7:38:49] Mhortai: @Luigicamp Ya this, in today's world it is an issue. GDKPs were also not the prevalent.
[7:38:52] Tragictomb: would be good system if no one bought gold but… everyone does lol
[7:38:57] The_Twick: i want to play wow, not a capitalism simulator
[7:38:57] Swingingwilly: the fact u can buy gold and u always have been able to if you wanted makes gdkp not a fair system
[7:38:58] opisop032: but you always could have bought gold even back then lol it hasnt ever ever changed
[7:38:58] comfyslayer: If one dude buys something for 30k gold, at least it gets redistributed to the rest
[7:39:05] comfyslayer: so that's not bad for the ppl not swiping
[7:39:14] iamurdefeat: facts GDKP is cringe
[7:39:17] Alerothan: The problem is that you're priced out of every GDKP because of people who RMT
[7:39:19] yowler_: I don't understand how people get enough money to even enter their first gdkp
[7:39:23] csmartypants: well damnit it shouldnt be gold then that you can "bid" with. lets push for it
[7:39:23] Spaceberry_McDuck: bring the modern loot system to season of discovery. nerds go crazy. much gnashing of teeth.
[7:39:26] TreeTopAnonymous: gdkps are great because you get rewarded for carrying and doc'd for wiping the raid. it incentivizes good players
[7:39:27] bagofcans88: That's blizzards fault for adding wow token then?
[7:39:33] kreyzy8: the problem is the gold buyers prop up the price of GDKPs to unrealistic amounts for non gold buyers
[7:39:36] Abruty: There would be more raid looking for people tho
[7:39:37] Kymagez: 4
[7:39:39] chipncheese: of course not b/c they have never done it themselves
[7:39:41] ItsBees: I've made some good gold having our guild sell carries :3 I got nothing against it
[7:39:44] itsbreadx: i think its an ok system but being able to farm gold outside of raids then is kinda meh, would like if there was a currency you could bid on gear with, that drops in raids
[7:39:45] nikthevoker: they put in ALOT OF WORK
[7:39:46] yowler_: It also inflates itself so hard that gdkp basically becomes the economy
[7:39:49] Merkflare: Blizzard wants people to form guilds and social connections to play raids
[7:39:50] madoxstudios: Honestly let guilds just run their own DKP system. Worked great in vanilla
[7:39:51] shredder1111: those raids shouldnt happen, would force the people to raid properly or not raid at all
[7:39:51] itsjasyn: gdkp???
[7:39:51] The_Twick: look, i would agree with you if buying gold wasnt a thing. People arae also incentivized to make horrible comps to create as much competition as possible
[7:39:52] trikkSP: @bagofcans88 money speaks
[7:39:52] kreyzy8: its not the GDKP's itself as the issue, its how inflated the prices are
[7:39:57] Abruty: I think it ruins the RPG aspect of the game
[7:39:58] kurjade: gdkps are great
[7:40:05] Mhortai: @venruki the issue now is largely who is running the GDKPs
[7:40:07] megablink1: will you be casting awc?
[7:40:13] tangell0s: I ran my characters in BFD the entire lockout time. Towards the end, i'm looking for 1-2 pieces of gear. I'm not trying to lose that stuff to a dude's 6th alt if I can avoid it in an acceptable way
[7:40:15] Guidry: randomized loot is not really an RPG aspect
[7:40:16] nuckAU: I'm ok with them doing ANYTHING to curb gold buying. This is the lazy way and it wont 100% solve it but im happy its happening <3 󠀀
[7:40:18] Intravz: gdkp players are better than ms > os puggers i swear
[7:40:21] The_Twick: like people cook GDKP groups with horrible comps just to increase competition on items.
[7:40:21] Abruty: Classic is not retail
[7:40:21] Chadww: the loot system in classic wow is fucking garbage, so little stuff drops for how many people and you can run a raid for a year and not get a particular item to drop.
[7:40:22] TreeTopAnonymous: teleporting in and out of dungeons ruined the rpg aspect
[7:40:23] xkayne: I dont know man.. No life dorks are going to want to run the raid over and over.
[7:40:27] Luigicamp: yeah that's not gonna happen again
[7:40:29] chizzad52: not if I am playing the role of a rich person buying gear in a raid
[7:40:31] Chadww: if the loot system wasn't so bad then gdkps wouldn't be needed
[7:40:32] trikkSP: its not 2006, the internet is too interlinked for this
[7:40:32] madoxstudios: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[7:40:37] rembrandt89: good i hope the game never becomes vanilla
[7:40:37] Swingingwilly: you can’t earn gold if your a rper?
[7:40:38] Extramediums: GDKP positive: Wow token sales on servers that have it. Jimmy two bit who has a plethora of disposable income to buy gold can now get that shiny piece of gear, or mount, or title. Helps fund botters.
[7:40:39] ItsBees: Also people don't have to join these groups...
[7:40:43] Kymagez: AGREED AND LUIGI OWES ME ALLOWANCE
[7:40:44] Abruty: you dont
[7:40:45] Alerothan: @TreeTopAnonymous This take is annoying, people literally summon people in classic wow lmao
[7:40:46] opisop032: games changed big time, its advanced to get stuff done as fast as possible
[7:40:46] bagofcans88: People quick to shit on gdkp "ruins the RPG" etc. But in the wider context, this is blizzards fault
[7:40:47] Badasti: i think dkp is way better than the modern model
[7:40:47] Velr3y: leroy jenkins
[7:40:50] ItsBees: Kymmmmmmm rukiLove
[7:40:54] uhdaptiv: thats a crazy idea ven
[7:40:54] Luigicamp: yeah you can, or could I should say
[7:40:57] BrewCral: not on the internet no
[7:40:58] nuckAU: @ItsBees There's only gdkps left in era/tbc
[7:40:59] kurjade: yea why  people whining about gdkps u dont have to participate
[7:41:00] ImJordanHi: The actual reality is, none of our opinions even matter lol unfortunately
[7:41:00] Kymagez: BEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS <3
[7:41:02] Mhortai: You don't, but it has negative affects on people who want to progress in raiding.
[7:41:09] ItsBees: It's like when people complain about them adding pet battle stuff, y'all don't have to do it
[7:41:10] BrewCral: people will just cry at nothing for no reason
[7:41:11] chipncheese: @Mhortai how?
[7:41:13] HolyXct: @venruki do you think we will see AWC LANs back in blizzcon 2024?
[7:41:16] bagofcans88: That's what I was saying, just don't do a gdkp if you don't want to? Play with your guild and friends?
[7:41:16] Kymagez: @Luigicamp ALLOWANCE NOW
[7:41:18] happyheals: people get mad because they are lazy and jealous of someone who took the effort to get a piece of gear
[7:41:21] Swingingwilly: devalues your efforts if anyone can just jump in and buy that hard to get gear
[7:41:22] kurjade: @Mhortai how?? are u stupid :D
[7:41:24] modsbruto: yes, because i want legendary axe
[7:41:25] Luigicamp: @Kymagez what do you need
[7:41:28] whitecrox: If you gonna allow ppl to buy gold via tokens and just make it so that the ppl with the most money win the best items, you're better off just making a cashshop.
[7:41:29] Intravz: it does screw up the market tho
[7:41:29] MoastaJ: haven’t played wow in years wtf is a gdkp?
[7:41:30] chipncheese: @venruki i bet he's going to say "b/c it takes away good players from bad players runs"
[7:41:37] yowler_: you can. I play sod and dont do gdkp. I think the larger issue is how it inflates the economy for everyone else by pumping so much gold
[7:41:39] madoxstudios: almost said it right :) Mad Ox  is how it's pronounced
[7:41:41] trikkSP: LUL
[7:41:43] chipncheese: ROFL HAD TO GET  HHAHHAHHAHAHHHAHHAH
[7:41:48] Kymagez: i just like to tantrum <3
[7:41:52] Malte_L: hard to get LUL
[7:41:53] Luigicamp: lol
[7:41:56] TreeTopAnonymous: it's because of parsing. you can kill all the bosses with of group of green parses but everyone thinks if you don't 99 parse the game sucks
[7:41:56] tangell0s: GDKP is one of many models, there are SR runs, regular runs, HR runs, etc.
[7:41:57] Swingingwilly: it has levels
[7:42:00] The_Twick: I mean this GDKP ban is treating the sympton, not the cause. Just ban gold buying.....
[7:42:02] galdinator: LOL "devaluing my efforts"
[7:42:03] chipncheese: Classic and hard to get gear holy shit im done
[7:42:04] Solastro: wait isnt that the exact argument people had with the aotc mount being put on the trading post
[7:42:06] bagofcans88: It cheapens it? Only in your mind
[7:42:10] Mhortai: @venruki if you want to swap guilds to progress, not having certain gear can keep you from doing that.
[7:42:11] BrewCral: BRO ITS CLASSIC ARE YOU GUYS FOR FUCKING REAL LMAO HARD TO GET GEAR YOU PRESS 2 BUTTONS FOR $) SEC A BOSSSSSSSSSSS LMAO STOP FUCKING CRYING
[7:42:17] shawdowfax77: Same ven also played old classic and raided for over a year never got my item haha
[7:42:19] Mephitics: i remember that lol
[7:42:25] ImJordanHi: Why are random drops bad?
[7:42:26] MoastaJ: So wow turned into pay to win
[7:42:34] seraph_wow: brewcral you good dude
[7:42:34] 0hlando: did u want to cry a little inside tho
[7:42:34] modsbruto: @BrewCral lol, word
[7:42:41] ZEXbbot: sam worked hard for his rng and you didnt
[7:42:42] bagofcans88: @moastaj yeah, blame blizzard
[7:42:44] zlovett08: hey ven, hows the day goin for ya
[7:42:45] chipncheese: @Mhortai get in a better guild, thats on you
[7:42:45] Satedtv: Chats brain broke
[7:42:46] jacob_the_mage: GDKP makes wow feel alot more like pay to win... it ruined the classic experience for me but thats just my take
[7:42:50] trikkSP: jesus, do yall misunderstand on purpose?
[7:42:51] Mhortai: @chipncheese ROFL
[7:42:53] modsbruto: i mean, let ppl buy gold...i couldnt care less
[7:42:59] morrs: that is indeed true
[7:43:03] The_Twick: you dont have to, but the amount of gold going around ruins the economy
[7:43:03] TreeTopAnonymous: TreeTopAnonymous is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to venruki's community! They've gifted a total of 17 in the channel!

[7:43:03] Davinciwowx: GDKP IS GREAT
[7:43:04] Extramediums: "if you don't like it, just don't participate" has the same energy as people abusing exploits. GDKP inflates everything in the market and also destroys the gold rewards for actual in game gold farming.
[7:43:05] yowler_: they kinda fuck up the whole economy tho
[7:43:06] Vendrek: Just wait...give it a few weeks and people will be upset that GDKPs don't exist and that there are hardly any raids running
[7:43:07] ItsBees: Pog
[7:43:07] Click_for_giggles: its the premades they should ban
[7:43:08] Abruty: Could end up good for the game, we'll see
[7:43:16] itsbreadx: if blizz made dkp into a loot system would be hype, u get points in raids u can bid on gear on, essentially negating all negative effects of gdkp, no?
[7:43:16] The_Twick: ty @Extramediums
[7:43:20] Luigicamp: PepoCheer
[7:43:22] Xenic0501: Ven, what are you even saying man Kappa Kappa
[7:43:23] Dwilk20: Asmond is right about one thing Blizzard has been too lazy to really go after the cheaters in this game.
[7:43:24] chizzad52: I wonder ifthey will  make any changes in retail. Specificially with buying boosts for gold
[7:43:24] TreeTopAnonymous: you deserve it
[7:43:25] Tragictomb: you end up interacting with it just by virtue of the way it impacts the auction house

[7:43:36] MoastaJ: Needed to farm to get gold back in the day
[7:43:36] Tragictomb: because people buy more gold than they would normally
[7:43:38] itsjasyn: ty for sub
[7:43:39] chipncheese: this guys whole argument is "my guild is bad so i dont want to see others progresing more hten me thast why i dont like GDKP"
[7:43:41] Tragictomb: so everything inflates harder
[7:43:43] The_Twick: it causes massive amounts of inflation, creates has and have nots, which encourages more people to buy gold, which causes more inflation, it is a vicious cycle
[7:43:48] kurjade: @itsbreadx lol that wont wokr
[7:43:51] nuckAU: I hate them because gold buying ruins the economy most times. The system itsself would be fine if it was impossible to buy gold i agree
[7:43:59] Swingingwilly: but they affect the economy that your participating in regardless of you engage in them
[7:44:01] yowler_: when you buy consumes for your non-gdkp raid, everything is at prices that are set for people based around gdkp levels of gold
[7:44:05] HolyXct: Wingygirl is 100% a guy
[7:44:07] tangell0s: @Vendrek Right? GDKPs give me incentive to run on my otherwise benched characters that have already gotten everything they need.
[7:44:08] Dwilk20: Absterge and Foxy both moments ago dealt with another one of those Ele bots
[7:44:10] shawdowfax77: thx for gifted sub!
[7:44:14] gelatokush: i never had enough gold to participate in gdkps people bought stuff for crazy amounts of gold
[7:44:14] Luigicamp: I am happy they added tokens though, as a true WoW player myself I blew $100 that day, I was filthy rich in game!
[7:44:22] nuckAU: @yowler_ this
[7:44:37] kreyzy8: regardless of the question to whether they should or shouldn't ban GDKP's, I'm more curious to see how they manage to uphold that rule lol
[7:44:37] The_Twick: i mean shit, items are going for 53k per item in wotlk
[7:44:40] The_Twick: that is insane
[7:44:52] itsbreadx: @kurjade i dont see why not, you get 10 points every boss u kill, spend as you want when pressing "need" what am i missing
[7:44:53] Extramediums: You're all welcome to your opinions, that's fine. At the end of the day many economy have been destroyed due to influxes if commodities that have been introduced by nefarious methods.
[7:45:02] Swingingwilly: but it’s hard to imagine how they would work if you couldn’t buy gold probly be the fairest system in the game if all gold was legit
[7:45:16] Mhortai: @venruki if you couldn't buy gold GDKPs wouldn't be a big issue. Still causes inflation etc but right now it ruins the market. They are never going to 100% cut out gold buying I don't think. Its harder than people think. I get your argument but you can buy gold that is the issue.
[7:45:16] trikkSP: isnt everything fixed with bosses dropping tokens and then you can buy whatever you wnat
[7:45:24] aurelioristv: 100k dps rogue^
[7:45:25] gelatokush: ye idk how u make tha tamount of gold legit but watever for me that the problem with gdkp on paper the concept is good the feeling i get in the game is diff
[7:45:40] peeachy8: @trikkSP only on the last bosses
[7:45:45] lucksh20: sus mage
[7:46:00] kurjade: @Mhortai get on gdkp and stop being poor
[7:46:12] trikkSP: @peeachy8 different tokens for different bosses
[7:46:17] Mhortai: @kurjade I don't have gold issues their friend. But I am not everyone.
[7:46:35] peeachy8: no I mean the one that let's you pick anything is on last boss
[7:46:44] kurjade: #fuckcasuals
[7:46:51] Extramediums: @Mhortai Ah yes, the rebuttal of "Just don't be poor lol". How much of a pedant can you be.
[7:46:53] tangell0s: @Extramediums The problem is that this is an addressing the symptom not the problem approach. Banning GDKPs won't stop people from buying gold.
[7:46:57] Mhortai: @kurjade This game would be said without casuals.
[7:46:58] tarth_100: "like"
[7:47:12] Swingingwilly: I’m to scared to play shuffles now I don’t wanna loose my 1800 rating was so hard to get
[7:47:13] chipncheese: @tangell0s it actually might increase botting and gold buying
[7:47:19] flandrs: how would they even fix the gold buying issue
[7:47:19] Extramediums: @Extramediums so we should simply just throw our collective hands in the air and say "well, we can't solve everything at the same time, so we won't even try!"
[7:47:22] jacob_the_mage: I think im just biased towards GDKP
[7:47:33] nuckAU: @tangell0s give them less reason to buy gold and we all know most gold bought goes to gdkps
[7:47:36] Mhortai: Blizzard can't directly block buying gold.
[7:47:43] chizzad52: They will just make guilds and youll have to put your gold in the bank. Then you divy it out
[7:47:54] gelatokush: id say 85% of classic players bought gold if id have to guess
[7:47:54] Doxsis: wshat was the previous song?
[7:47:55] chizzad52: This wont stop GDKP, it will just change them
[7:48:06] Mhortai: @chizzad52 Most likely ya.
[7:48:29] crymorre: ratJAM
[7:48:36] Swingingwilly: I think banning GDKP is a preventative measure.  Takes out 1 major reason people would buy gold imo
[7:48:37] Extramediums: GDKP is one of the main reasons that buying gold is so popular. Removing it starts to shift the game away from needing it, which in turn reduces the incentive for so many gold sellers to do what they do to sell it.
[7:48:42] flyingorangee: dh almost double dps what the hell is that class
[7:49:02] chipncheese: @flyingorangee its alot of fluff againast demo lock
[7:49:21] flyingorangee: @chipncheese NOTED
[7:49:40] chipncheese: i mean they do alot of dmg, but the reason its so much RIGHT NOW is b/c he's hitting like 10 pets
[7:49:40] Extramediums: People who support GDKP tend to be the ones that have benefited from it in one way or another.
[7:50:04] Extramediums: Or people who do not understand how markets work
[7:50:25] Swingingwilly: it’s shit for the people that legit use gdkp but it’s no different to drugs I can’t take them even tho they make me untouchable because sally took them and she killed 4 people
[7:50:28] Badasti: DansGame
[7:50:45] flyingorangee: @chipncheese that is also true
[7:50:45] jacob_the_mage: @Venruki you shoutcasting in AWC?
[7:50:47] peeachy8: I'm for gdkp and I have never been in one. other people getting gear that way doesn't bother me.
[7:50:50] shinydunsparce: the 1 hp evasion
[7:50:56] Mhortai: GDKPs have existed all the way back to TBC as far as I remember @venruki it's just who is running them and where the gold is coming from now and the amounts that is the issue. I don't think on the face of things GDKPs are bad.
[7:50:59] Swingingwilly: that’s the world we live in people for the minority that can’t play fair
[7:51:06] morrs: DHs dmg is very high
[7:51:17] mackypawp: Sometimes its out of your hands despite how well you play
[7:51:34] itsbreadx: the worst part about gdkps is honestly the culture of having 'buyers' because you know those ppl are just ppl who buys a shit ton of gold
[7:51:58] Badasti: this is an awful map, cant even line to get vilefiend and tyrant out
[7:52:03] Extramediums: @itsbreadx I wouldn't say that's the 'worst'  part of it, but certainly an aspect of it
[7:52:14] gelatokush: if there was no way of buying gold gdkp would be a great system, but gold buying will neevr go away

[7:52:48] gelatokush: XD
[7:53:02] Extramediums: wow tokens were such a bad addition to the game. But I suppose blizz really wanted to get in on that RMT pie
[7:53:45] peeachy8: how has it personally affected you?
[7:54:01] The_Twick: do they know it is you?
[7:54:05] gelatokush: the fact u can buy game time with gold is a great idea, the problem is being able to sel lthe token

[7:56:05] Extramediums: @peeachy8 so, your logic is pointing to "well, you made gold at some point during the game, so it's obviously good!", which is probably one of the more asinine things I've heard this week, and I work with upper level executives that still play golf in the office

[8:01:16] Mhortai: I said this to a few people, and I like the idea of WoW being on the pass, but 1000% more things will be added to the cash shop.

[8:01:53] Extramediums: @peeachy8 It's obvious you add nothing in this conversation other than derailing it with false equivalencies and a grade 1 level of understanding in econ so I'll no longer continue entertaining you with responses. I will however leave you with a quote from a wonderful movie that seems to fit perfectly with your logic:
[8:01:59] Extramediums: Nowhere in your rambling, incoherent response did you come close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. We are all dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul. Billy Madison
[8:02:02] Mhortai: I invest all my money into video games. LOL
