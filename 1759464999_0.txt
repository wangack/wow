[1:06:16] Capnrein: Mining and engineering, or tailoring and enchanting
[1:06:19] TheBoulderx: for engineering you need ore, leather and cloth to level it up
[1:06:23] NOHITJEROME: you can farm the materials like leather from mobs
[1:06:25] Gulltherizul: If you engineering you have to mine for ore to level

[1:30:12] JoeTheBoss: im pretty sure that quest is horde
[1:30:19] biakugan97: Just get your wand and then learn anything u want. U can only run dungeons ONCE.
[1:30:44] JoeTheBoss: that lvl 20 quest wand is i think horde only
[1:30:49] Gulltherizul: Do you mean BFD?
[1:30:58] PaEu: that wand is from BFD, and its like lvl 19+, you need a wand before
[1:31:01] biakugan97: No lvl 30 tailor not you level 30. Id guess you be around lvl 10 for 2nd wand man
[1:31:02] Baldmight: Fire belcher, its a Rare npc to drop it.
[1:31:26] JoeTheBoss: he's talking about the BFD wand
[1:31:36] JoeTheBoss: but u need a wand b4 lvl 19
[1:31:42] Quillmane: yes, he means Blackfathom Deeps, not serpentine cavern or whatever he said
[1:31:45] x_NATE: Did you hear the news about retail, Swifty? cross faction guilds inc
[1:32:18] JoeTheBoss: on HC the enchanting till ur like lvl 30+ tbh
[1:32:31] Cowardpatty: Just saw the his name.... Icepapi   hahaha
[1:32:33] JoeTheBoss: its even better then the brd quest wand
[1:32:46] aeonaxxxxx: damn dude what happened to Steven? I know Mike was with him earlier but Craig said he wasn't even there...I even tried calling Danny but Bruce picked up and said to ask you
[1:33:05] toto_bamze: what do u think about Dragonflight compared to shadowlands and boa
[1:33:18] Lucons1: yo swifty is this ur first HC run?
[1:33:37] toto_bamze: bfa ;d
[1:33:37] kragnos0: battle for azeroth xD
[1:33:37] astronyirl: He means BFA*
[1:33:38] JoeTheBoss: battle of az
[1:33:38] Troopsie: battle of azeroth
[1:33:40] biakugan97: People dont seem to understand my route. Go tailoring until tailor level 30, u get green robes, u disenchant those aaaalll the way to level 70 enchanting, which means you have to farm linen cloth. When you got your 2nd wand (around lvl 12-13) I would go engineering for the target dummy, and mining ofc.
[1:33:42] eudisius: lol
[1:33:49] JoeTheBoss: for*
[1:34:07] Teagens: Wow has just become a job
[1:34:15] Teagens: The new profession system is awful
[1:34:20] Cowardpatty: Still is..  It's just most people are 'caught up' as far as content goes.
[1:34:21] JoeTheBoss: u actually can get that wand by lvl 8 tbh
[1:34:26] Teagens: And Mythic Dungeons have destroyed the game and raids
[1:34:33] Digmadness: First major patch soon for df
[1:34:35] levendizz: people don't like good expansions
[1:34:44] levendizz: they like bad ones so they can comp[l;ain about somthing
[1:34:49] astronyirl: I think the new profession system is cool. I have never wanted to do any professions until now.
[1:34:55] neugassh: DF had half the players SL had
[1:34:57] Cowardpatty: The new profession system is good.  It's just too hard to level and too dependent on work orders.
[1:35:11] Lucons1: a little hard to hear u over the music
[1:35:11] biakugan97: @joetheboss thats hard. You you need a total of around 140 linen cloths. With good RNG you can.
[1:35:17] c4rp3lli: Theres no exccitement to gear anbymore, nothing beats a first green drop in classic
[1:35:20] Digmadness: I dont mind the new professions the ui however no go for me, back to elvui
[1:35:20] SeeStarss: SWITFY YOUR DOING HARDCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:35:23] SeeStarss: YESSSSSSSSS
[1:35:29] Teagens: Mind you, I dont hate WoW, Dragonflight was fun and I enjoyed it up to the point I cleared everything----but now that I am "done" and looking at what I have left that I "could" do, it's just become a Job now. That's not fun to me.
[1:35:35] sewer_creature: This is the 1st expansion where I almost ignore professions, they are horrible
[1:36:00] Lucons1: could you increase mic  a little? or lower music @Swifty
[1:36:01] JoeTheBoss: its not hard u legit just go farm humanoids till u have the 140ish linen u need then go get the wand
[1:36:14] realdreadx: does 1-60 take months?
[1:36:14] Jsonpriestly: Retail wows problem is it doesn't feel like wow anymore.  Wrath and turtle wow and classic wow has waaay more players.  People like how wow use to be.
[1:36:14] 92mute: you havent

[1:37:16] toto_bamze: why all ppl are saying wow died after WOTLK. imo Legion was pretty good expansion too.
[1:37:20] Bobomahoney: What is hardcore wow
[1:37:38] astronyirl: I think classic plus sounds very good.
[1:37:39] Teagens: @Jsonpriestly Honestly I despise Classic WoW. It falls back to a dated system that has no Quality of Life improvements that Retail does but it's also a reminder that what was is gone and isn't coming back. The original team is completely gone.
[1:37:41] Troopsie: ashes of creation?
[1:37:43] SeeStarss: aches of creation?
[1:37:46] Arkstar0: ashes of creation?

[1:39:23] Teagens: That was IN GAME!?
[1:39:26] Teagens: OMG
[1:39:31] Teagens: THAT IS ACTUAL GAME!
[1:39:34] Teagens: THIS ISNT CINEMATIC
[1:39:37] Kuretake: we don't need the looks, we need the soul
[1:39:40] Teagens: That is ACTUALLY what it looks like!?
[1:39:40] toto_bamze: its impossible for wow to look like this. 80% of the players wont be able to run it
[1:39:45] Brittfire: ma poor gpu
[1:39:47] martzerarh: it'll never take off ;b
[1:40:05] c4rp3lli: Was that swifty charging at em through smoke?

[1:40:12] Teagens: GIVE!
[1:40:15] Teagens: GIVE NOW!!!
[1:40:16] Brittfire: wow plays on a potato
[1:40:21] JoeTheBoss: not gunna lie it has a FF14 vibe
[1:40:22] martzerarh: fancy graphics
[1:40:24] SeeStarss: Isn't the reason why wow classic is immortal, because the graphics?
[1:40:29] clearscreen: doesnt matter how good a game looks, its matters whos backing it. Look at every other MMO that has come out. they have all flopped
[1:40:33] neugassh: it was literally nothing LUL
[1:40:35] InfinityCryZz: Will wow ever be unreal engine 5???
[1:40:41] Baldmight: im just waiting for d4
[1:40:50] Digmadness: I like guild wars 2 have you thought about trying it @Swifty also i think microsoft is gonna do a massive optional wow upgrade for the graphics, they would be crazy not to.
[1:41:00] Arkstar0: all the good looking mmos of recent years have had terrible gameplay tho
[1:41:07] flye55: and bug, and skill. and equilibrium? wow is king
[1:41:08] neugassh: gameplay looks terrible
[1:41:24] WOOPsWOOP: another new world

[1:41:53] Teagens: WWWWWAAAAAAT
[1:41:57] Teagens: ITS ON MOBILE!?
[1:42:05] c4rp3lli: Its all about liquid movement, which makes wow superior. games alwasy feel clunky
[1:42:06] MorBlade: Looks as good as New World
[1:42:09] neugassh: its so scuffed
[1:42:16] JoeTheBoss: lol this is FF14/New World combined rofl
[1:42:18] astronyirl: i dont like the way these skyrim vibe mmos look
[1:42:24] martzerarh: f
[1:42:25] Digmadness: realism always fails in mmos it has no longevity, wow art style is timeless (but microsoft should upgrade it wtill)
[1:42:34] Kuretake: If only the technology allowed a world big enough that can host 100k MMO players on the same server.
[1:42:36] Teagens: Oh OH OHHHH! Swifty. I forgot to tell you on the Phone. What would you think about trying out Elder Scrolls Online with me? Some friends and I are thinking about trying it
[1:42:44] coconust1: There is another upcoming MMO called quinfall
[1:42:48] WOOPsWOOP: agreed
[1:42:53] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:43:00] JoeTheBoss: lol ppl like the game just bc it looks better then wow
[1:43:13] Arkstar0: i prefer good art style with great gameplay to insane graphics with bad gameplay. usually these new mmos fall into the latter category
[1:43:23] WOOPsWOOP: those games are a bitahead of their time
[1:43:23] freddy_fazbearrr: i want a ready player one VR mmo
[1:43:36] JoeTheBoss: that game will die within 2 months tops
[1:43:37] MorBlade: Eye Candy FTW
[1:43:57] Digmadness: wow looks great (retail) vs og 2004 wow, but microsoft should do an upgrade preserving the art style
[1:44:18] PandaSmuggl3r: VR is meh
[1:44:57] Arkstar0: VR is def the future once the tech gets better tho. you want immersion, THAT is immersion
[1:45:01] B_Rize: VR is overrated lol

[2:26:36] GordoOCE_: I played hardcore classic with my friend once we got to level 18 as gnome mage/warlock big sadge we died cant fully remeber how
[2:26:46] newaccountx999: Is it deleted when you die or do you have to do that yourself?
[2:26:48] Cowardpatty: That right there is why you keep Rank 1 Frostbolt on your bars

[2:28:11] Machinima5000: aww even the commercials on swifty's channel are wholesome
[2:28:31] newaccountx999: Is professions important in Classic? I never played Classic and didn't care for it back in Cata when i started :D
[2:28:38] bracki69: swiftyPhug
[2:28:50] Gunjin1992: Ok nice, had to check in here, was some wierd comments. Take care 🙂
[2:29:11] Cowardpatty: The struggles
[2:29:46] PaEu: swifty stop wasting money on professions and just kill mobs for now
[2:29:49] JoeTheBoss: @Swifty yeag et skinning for your first HC lvling atleast
[2:30:13] JoeTheBoss: going the wand route is more of a like a more sessioned HC xp player
[2:30:17] rugruth: Light leather sells for 3s/stack good money
[2:30:26] Maramis_is_Back: its classic or wotlka ?
[2:30:33] GordoOCE_: Could you get herbing for extra gold? havent played in a long time cant remeber if its still good
[2:30:43] rugruth: Also invest un bags
[2:30:43] astronyirl: Swifty, do you think they will do MoP classic? I seriously hope they will. God damn do i miss that expansion.
[2:30:59] Cowardpatty: Icepapi don't need not stinking Fireball
[2:31:03] JoeTheBoss: cant use the AH in HC challenge
[2:31:07] callmepeewee: lowkey warlock would probably be so easy for this achieve
[2:31:08] GordoOCE_: @astronyirl MoP would make me play classic
[2:31:20] Cowardpatty: Yeah, it's FREE food
[2:31:42] astronyirl: Oh 100%. I love MoP a
[2:31:57] makingapieofstuff: haven't checked wow for a while now, what is it with the Classic? Seems like a lot of ppl playing it atm?
[2:32:06] Digmadness: :D
[2:32:09] newaccountx999: @astronyirl I'm playing MoP. The biggest Pserver there is, is a MoP server. Quite active too for PvE and PvP
[2:32:21] vrything: nice challenge swifty
[2:32:24] PaEu: no swifty dont go back, just do quests for now
[2:32:31] PaEu: at lvl 8 you will get quests to kill mobs that give you linen
[2:32:49] rugruth: Agree
[2:33:17] astronyirl: Yeah but i feel like i can't compete with the players that play on Private servers because of the insane gear advantage. I played on Warmane for a bit but i literally couldn't gear up through pvp because i would just get oneshot by fully decked out players. Mind you im a 3100 xp resto druid haha.
[2:34:06] Cowardpatty: I'll stick to paintball
[2:34:07] newaccountx999: @astronyirl Yeah i feel you on that. It does take some grinding!
[2:34:29] Capnrein: you gonna end up dying if you tab out of wow lol
[2:34:46] Jamppatsuu: that silo guy is good
[2:34:49] newaccountx999: Airsoft is SO fun
[2:34:51] astronyirl: Yeah it is dangerous to tab out like that in HC
[2:35:26] JoeTheBoss: that guy payo, has died like 3 times from alt tabbing out rofl
[2:35:27] astronyirl: how do they film inside the scope of the sniper? I always thought about that haha
[2:35:32] Destro_04: did you see the level 60 warlock afk and died to a level 6 wolf
[2:36:02] vrything: it dosent show the debuff to show you HC ?
[2:36:12] GordoOCE_: Do you still use the orbweaver? mine broke years ago and i miss it got the tartarus V2 now and its decent but not the same BibleThump BibleThump
[2:36:16] JoeTheBoss: oh u mean that video that the priest just stood there and watched which was kind of messed up

[2:39:54] Digmadness: thinking* prob watch it tonight lol
[2:40:16] Digmadness: Oh nice
[2:40:36] Digmadness: amd drivers always crashed my systems for some reason
[2:40:53] HeManAj1: amd is not good for streaming
[2:41:00] JoeTheBoss: AMD aint bad like they use to be
[2:41:22] JoeTheBoss: yea if you wanna stream AMD aint worth getting
[2:41:23] Digmadness: Amd is much better than the Ati days when they first purchased them
[2:41:43] Meccka: Never been Impressed with AMD I have Tried 3 .  Switched to Nvidia and never looked back
[2:42:00] HeManAj1: the best AMD amt is the 7900XTX and its only as good as the 4070TI
[2:42:04] Spart4nm4n: i remember finding you from videos like this when starting wow. https://youtu.be/_C2M17qJ9-Q
[2:42:27] birdhouse33: Yes I get crashing still

[2:43:00] Rastafaris: Amd for me was overheating a lot not crashes but intel is just smooth sailing
[2:43:01] Digmadness: thats why i went to nvidia and havent switched back
[2:43:10] GuitarsCadillacs: That error still happens with Nvidia from time to time too, at least with me
[2:43:30] Cowardpatty: I run AMD and I've never had any problems with Minesweeper or Solitaire
[2:43:33] HeManAj1: AMD have bad drivers and the 7900XTX which is the best amd is only as good as the 4070 TI
[2:43:35] HitmanGSMike: i did have it when i upgraded but i went onto thier website and did the AMD cleanup Utility and is working now
[2:43:48] Spart4nm4n: Ret Paladins!  i remember finding you from videos like this when starting wow. https://youtu.be/_C2M17qJ9-Q @Swifty

[4:47:11] zomclown: What happend to the YouTube video you were going to post
[4:47:17] Neumonyx: wand YES
[4:47:20] Neumonyx: you want me asap
[4:47:23] Luck_ness: wands are useful
[4:47:23] Orshin28: you dont need a wand
[4:47:28] WiseguyGG: Honestly I’d say for sure
[4:47:28] Neumonyx: Worth going Ench to get one
[4:47:28] Seanio7: they usually drop early but you can also buy one at 16
[4:47:29] hollywood__cole: i bet everyone is prolific in first aid lol
[4:47:34] hrod1life: Be twinked out and enter by and just don't die
[4:47:42] Neumonyx: you dont NEED anything, but you SHOULD get one asap
[4:47:53] neugassh: just pick herbalism and skinning
[4:48:09] the_happy_sloth: I would use a wand , you can frostbolt then wand down
[4:48:11] Orshin28: quest in BFD
[4:48:17] Seanio7: vendor in main cities at 16
[4:48:32] Neumonyx: ^yes, but that is far off - quest in BFD
[4:48:38] 54v3r: ther is a vendor but they are  expensive
[4:48:51] Seanio7: skinning tailoring is pretty good
[4:49:04] Neumonyx: also, in my runs, mining eng is best for any HC run. Being able to make target dummies = living in dire situations
[4:49:12] Seanio7: skinning for selling yeah
[4:49:17] hollywood__cole: Would definitely pay more attention to vendors if you aren't allowed to use AH
[4:49:21] Neumonyx: you do need to go skinning at first to save up skins
[4:49:22] Luck_ness: westfall and loch modan have wands quests

[4:50:09] W_a_z_e_R: @Swifty enchanting requires BS, which requires mining
[4:50:15] DeadlySpaghetti: how do you make money from skinning if you cant use AH?
[4:50:21] W_a_z_e_R: for the rods
[4:50:27] WiseguyGG: Enchanting would take forever anyways in hc wouldn’t it
[4:50:36] delirious555: @DeadlySpaghetti You just vendor it
[4:50:54] Znapit: Enhanting is really bad for HC because you cant make the rod later on
[4:50:59] W_a_z_e_R: @Swifty enchanting requires BS for the rods, which requires mining
[4:51:27] Ridaarn: Suppppo swifty
[4:51:32] Znapit: The wand is 10 enchaning
[4:51:55] Neumonyx: ya, only take ench long enough to get your first wand, then drop it. Take mining skinning, then drop skinning after you have stacked up some leather to make eng dummies
[4:51:57] Mournous: u can buy wands in SW anyways
[4:51:59] jredbingo: Someone train him so we get the subs 😭
[4:52:09] Wittbrah: @swifty basicly u need about roughly 220 linen to make items to DE enchanting to lvl 70 to craft the lvl 13 wand
[4:52:13] Mournous: wand vendor in SW but i think the lowest one is 15
[4:52:14] the_happy_sloth: I remember the enchanting trainers were in uldaman too that was a pain
[4:52:20] Orshin28: wands are useless on mage
[4:52:28] Valganas: first wand doesn't need smithing
[4:52:29] Znapit: the first wand does not require BS
[4:52:36] Aforemore: you only need 10 enchanting for the first wand. No BS required
[4:52:37] Luck_ness: nah u dont need BS for wand
[4:52:41] hrod1life: Certain quests give wand insane wand in bfd quest
[4:52:45] Valganas: neither does 2nd
[4:52:47] Orshin28: skinning helps for gold with new spells and vendour bags
[4:53:00] Flopsee: swifty please say hello to me! <3
[4:53:05] Sivain: @swifty u on classic?
[4:53:09] Rando1988: they enchanter sells the stuff u need for the rod u would need tho
[4:53:26] Flopsee: thank you!!!!

[5:00:26] Pinsvin1010: Wierd you have to do so much work, when you litteraly get spammed with '' Recommended '' stuff
[5:00:29] wizegamer: youtube went way down hill to grow
[5:00:31] Stixxerz: okay time to get to bed gonna catch u later @Swifty
[5:00:34] Kwayzu: bell and select all
[5:00:43] scribbleton_: I checked recently, and have been subscribed to your youtube channel JohnSJU since 2010
[5:01:01] im_maxinn: after dislike got removed, youtube went downhill REAL quick
[5:01:08] TheOfficialGimp: @Kwayzu yeah, tthink it's because i didn't set to show all
[5:01:33] Kwayzu: i think defautl is "personalized" so im not sure what all goes into that
[5:02:17] Kwayzu: very neat stats
[5:02:28] Kwayzu: yeah cause twitch defaults to notify
[5:02:38] Kwayzu: i always disable notifications on twitch lol
[5:02:53] wizegamer: you  know what I miss , in youtube back in day , when you post a video , you cant add comments or annotations  in the video, you cant do that now
[5:02:59] TanekDK: except after twitch app was discontinued, my browser will not notify me for twitch
[5:03:17] scribbleton_: I've been subscribed to your youtube channel since 2010
[5:03:25] Rando1988: swifty I just checked my YouTube sub for your YouTube  and I get all notifications
[5:03:37] weipengbird: To be fair, you stopped posting in the IRL channel too, I used to watch every video with notifications
[5:03:39] Kwayzu: @TanekDK there's different options for where you get notifications
[5:03:48] Kwayzu: you can enable them for some devices and not others
[5:03:52] asmodeuss32: swifty do you still talk to rico and paco?
[5:04:10] wizegamer: yah any creator will say , only a small % comes from subbers with views
