[0:27:25] Sarocus: Damn, dont think Lux wants to deal with my shit today
[0:27:53] joustiif: yeah gamepass version is half-ass version it seems
[0:27:56] Ronangic: luxthoHi
[0:28:13] Baladore: Yeah I would say solo for sure
[0:28:28] Voidthos: @joustiif Huh?  How so?
[0:28:39] Sarocus: no answers, not even an hello. Getting the silent treatment over here

[0:28:53] TheCyberianMonk: TheCyberianMonk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[0:28:59] Stormrazer78: is this a Pokémon game?
[0:29:07] SelroDreyar: gamepass is an older patch since its the console version
[0:29:08] Baladore: @Voidthos Because it requires Certification
[0:29:19] Voidthos: @Baladore ???
[0:29:21] Spicy_Gun: ahhh finaly palworld
[0:29:25] joustiif: ah yep
[0:29:34] Sarocus: doing good. Making chili and about to play some palworld
[0:29:35] TheCyberianMonk: Good, we finally have drivable roads.
[0:29:48] giggity360: is that why steam has all those porn games?
[0:30:04] Voidthos: Medieval
[0:30:09] Baladore: @giggity360 That's just because they want money LUL
[0:30:21] Voidthos: I didn't realize they were different, let me check difference
[0:30:22] joustiif: how long will it take them to catch it up then ,i went ahead and got it on steam
[0:30:48] Voidthos: The game is still playable on Game Pass, but it lacks some key features and quality-of-life improvements. For instance, the Game Pass version currently has faulty button prompts, overall slower crafting, and it doesn’t have the option to exit the game without a force quit.
[0:31:05] Zladar: Luxthonia
[0:31:07] neverbornlucky: Lux you liked lego fortnite so I can already tell you that you'll like this more
[0:31:10] sazern: Luxtopia
[0:31:16] nuclearphosphate: @Voidthos game is just not good at all tbh
[0:31:19] Spicy_Gun: Luxthonia
[0:31:27] SelroDreyar: this game is valheim with pokemon
[0:31:29] Zladar: Luxbredia1820
[0:31:46] Baladore: This game will catch you like valheim
[0:31:48] nuclearphosphate: @SelroDreyar no doubt why i deteste it with a passion, hated valheim
[0:31:48] joustiif: yeah Luxthonia
[0:31:56] giggity360: i called mine Worldbuscus. Because nostalgia lol

[0:35:13] PaganFlute: i dont get it. This game doesnt hook me at all seeing it. Also looks super cheap and partly stolen. Kinda makes me wanna watch some tv series maybe
[0:35:29] nuclearphosphate: @PaganFlute its a knockoff of soooo many games imo
[0:35:35] Voidthos: Okay so all I can find for differences are:  4 player max on Gamepass (32 on Steam), slower crafting (can be adjusted in server settings), have to alt+f4 to quit game lol, controller issues

[0:47:07] giggity360: palbox creates base area, so be careful with placement
[0:47:08] the_Matloc: Nintendo is EXTREMELY litigative.  If they have an issue, it'll become common knowledge.
[0:47:12] Stormrazer78: what can you do with the sheep that you captured
[0:47:20] IAmSacrilicious: I dont care if games steal shit from each other. As long as they implement it well and make the game fun, I'm happy.
[0:47:25] soale4soale: I personally wrote a letter to nintendo asking for pokemon with guns so uh
[0:47:31] Khadgarlic: If atleast we could have a real survival pokemon game

[0:52:33] noosphear: @eclipsion_haze I mean... you kind of do.
