[1:31:44] ItzGucciGaming: How does  resto kitty damage scale or is it just base damage?
[1:31:53] Metket: don't tell me you still need anything xd
[1:32:04] CyonDru: whats that talent WA/add on again? to not make the selection screen so damn big

[1:32:36] CyonDru: nah for the tree sorry
[1:32:56] CyonDru: thanks homie
[1:33:15] jhand1es: thoughts on druid hero talents seems interesting
[1:33:54] ItzGucciGaming: Yeah starting to gear mine and its damage seems insane just wondering if it goes up as I get more int or primarily scales off the secondary stats
[1:34:17] McGyverStyle: I really want to see the feral/resto hero talents. hopefully there is some sweet m+ juice there
[1:34:25] Guffels: its just power creep across every class in the game with a mini mop talent tree thrown in.
[1:34:48] jhand1es: i feel like feral resto will either be giga pog or dog
[1:35:41] Guffels: feral/resto is probably gunna be all about making your dots/hots tick faster or more
[1:36:01] McGyverStyle: which (depending on numbers) should be pog as fuck
[1:36:11] ottomr1990: ret pally is so nice when you don't have prot
[1:36:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:36:30] Guffels: for raid it will be great for resto going back to hots but trees are probably here to stay in m+
[1:38:22] McGyverStyle: I dont mind trees when I can press them whenever I want. but if i have to ramp and save them until the ramp is done its pretty unfun for me
[1:38:56] Guffels: if trees get played in raid that will be the meta for the 10% healing increase but in keys it wont matter
[1:39:02] hewralol: !commands
[1:39:02] StreamElements: @hewralol You can find a list of all Commands here https://StreamElements.com/jdotb/commands
[1:40:24] McGyverStyle: look all ill say is that if trees are bis for raid i dont know if i can continue as rdruid
[1:44:17] brewteafulgaming: i'm so dumb i'm sitting here saying to myself when did dudu get penance then realised you on your priest

[1:45:31] aristin_hs: what's dudu
[1:45:37] brewteafulgaming: druid
[1:45:44] aristin_hs: lol
[1:46:20] brewteafulgaming: can tell its 1 off them days for me
[1:46:51] Guarok: Didn't know there was maint on US servers this morning.  Had to zoom through an AD.  As we got to the second boss we saw the warning.  Finished the key in 11 mins after that.
[1:49:00] ren0m: What is holy priest missing compared to disc?
[1:49:37] Guffels: for keys, being able to do damage and heal at the same time. for raid, nothing aside from not being meta on day 1
[1:50:06] ren0m: So basically holy is still good but it's the second best spec for priest
[1:50:10] McGyverStyle: agreed, hpriest dmg is pretty good but cant heal at the same time
[1:50:15] ren0m: Because of lack of dmg
[1:50:38] Guffels: in keys ya. also at the highest levels throughput is less useful than shields and dr
[1:50:54] McGyverStyle: yeah the biggest thing holy is missing is PS
[1:51:13] ren0m: I don't really like disc style so I'll try holy. I'm not running 30s so it should be fine I suppose
[1:51:14] ren0m: PS?
[1:51:25] McGyverStyle: pain supp
[1:51:28] ren0m: Ah
[1:51:42] Guffels: oh yeah you can easily do weekly 20s on holy. people do 29s on holy
[1:52:02] ren0m: I learned that everything works in DF
[1:52:15] McGyverStyle: there have been 2 30+ done on holy so it can work but idk
[1:52:21] Guffels: yeah just dont look at 10.1.5 lol. that tier was fucked
[1:52:41] ren0m: Except for super high keys where it seems like the meta is set, but even that is probably because of players and not so much because X spec is the only viable option.
[1:52:53] McGyverStyle: everything is good, except 31 specs in season 2
[1:53:10] ren0m: I only played S1 and took a break until recently :D
[1:53:16] Guffels: https://mythicstats.com/meta
[1:53:29] ren0m: Haven't done any M+ before, since I didn't play WoW since Cata
[1:53:30] Guffels: this is a fun site for looking at how meta changes over a season and expansion
[1:53:39] ren0m: Nice, thank you
[1:54:25] ren0m: !vault
[1:54:25] StreamElements: lazy week, only did druid and took coins

[1:55:57] ren0m: It's a metaphor
[1:55:58] t4pekid: Like this group, was fun to watch
[1:56:28] jeepsrus: whyyyy are servers bricked on NA
[1:56:35] KrugsNRoses1: slut car huh?
[1:56:35] ren0m: So did the right team win the Super Bowl?
[1:57:10] KrugsNRoses1: Yeah NA servers are scuffed. "Live Maintenance" my ass
[1:57:20] CaptainBoop: gmgm
[1:57:30] McGyverStyle: do we know what the maintenance is even for?
[1:58:10] KrugsNRoses1: Anduin Wrynn prolly spit in the wrong spot in SW
[1:58:19] KrugsNRoses1: Gotta reset that
[2:00:25] Snfory: yo chat. mdi when?
[2:00:39] theBroHam: this weekend is group A
[2:00:48] Snfory: in the 16th?
[2:01:05] theBroHam: ye
[2:01:41] dwinchh: Sup dude! How is the key queue in EU? Im thinking of swapping from NA. There just isnt enough high keys in NA.
[2:01:56] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:02:40] dwinchh: I tested the ping and its only 110-115MS
[2:02:47] Nico_vdM: Hey @jdotb and chat
[2:03:44] Nico_vdM: Just know that switching from NA to EU will be a fresh start
[2:03:59] jeepsrus: What is that addon for your LFG
[2:04:05] ren0m: Is reaching KSM considered decent?
[2:04:05] theBroHam: !wt
[2:04:05] StreamElements: if you use ElvUI use this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/elvui-windtools | if no ElvUI use this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wind-dungeon-helper
[2:04:19] dwinchh: @Nico_vdM yeh its sad haha. Thinking of maintaining my NA and have an EU on the side
[2:04:27] Guffels: @ren0m this season its pretty free but if you are brand new its a great start
[2:04:58] ren0m: Well in other games you have "ranks" and you know approximately when you can consider yourself a "good" player
[2:05:10] ren0m: Granted asking someone who's 3.8k, anything below 3.5k is low
[2:05:11] Nonyamuff: KSM is enough for me...but all I do is pug...if I had a static, I'd try for more
[2:05:40] ohlittlebrain: a good pug goal is 3kio IMO for most people
[2:05:52] Guffels: yeah in wow its different season to season so its hard to say. raider io ranking for your spec is the closest you will get
[2:06:03] Nonyamuff: I must have found the wrong pugs 🤣
[2:06:19] kelly_mac06: yea ive pugged to 3k
[2:06:20] ren0m: Well, I reached 2k in the second week, but I'm nowhere near stuck there. Goal is 3k but I'll see where is my limit.
[2:06:24] kelly_mac06: it's not super fun but it's doable
[2:06:35] kelly_mac06: i dont do nearly as many keys as some degens i know tho lol
[2:06:42] KrugsNRoses1: Yeah I got 3.2k just pugging but I think that's the limit
[2:06:47] dwinchh: What is there for 27-28 keys? Can you check and help me out haha
[2:07:02] ohlittlebrain: I pug between 3-3.2k every season and more above that just starts to get where u want a premade
[2:07:17] Pinslate: groups just make the queue boss less daunting
[2:07:17] ohlittlebrain: at least for me
[2:07:23] Guffels: i didnt bother passing KSH since there was no point. did 3k last season and the experience fell flat for me
[2:07:24] McGyverStyle: @ren0m for context for you, top 0.1% of players is 3750 rn
[2:07:37] ohlittlebrain: @Pinslate Tru, i think thats the problem when playing dps at higher level for sure
[2:07:44] dwinchh: Thats double to triple the amount vs NA
[2:07:53] ren0m: I probably won't get there. it's my second season playing M+
[2:07:58] dwinchh: @KrugsNRoses1 I pugged to 3.5k
[2:08:02] ren0m: But I'll defenitely try :)
[2:08:09] Guffels: I have someone in my guild who pugged 3.4k then quit the game because of the burn out
[2:08:11] Nico_vdM: btw you only want the helm with avoidance not the belt?
[2:08:31] theBroHam: @ren0m you can do it! I started in DF and got to 3k this season.
[2:08:43] McGyverStyle: @ren0m as long as youre having fun keep pushing but dont burn yourself out
[2:08:56] ren0m: Thanks @theBroHam
[2:09:04] sw0ngs: where's the team today?
[2:09:04] kelly_mac06: @Guffels ye that's what i dont want tbh
[2:09:19] kelly_mac06: it's easy to go too hard and burn the fuck out
[2:09:19] ren0m: Ye it's fun for me, I was just wondering what's the score I should aim for
[2:09:30] Pinslate: dispel
[2:09:34] ren0m: And unlike most other players I don't really have bad experiences doing M+s
[2:09:37] theBroHam: Someone in my guild got fired from his job because he worked from home and would have work on one screen and was pugging keys on the other. He got up to like 3.6k
[2:09:54] ren0m: I've had 1 group disband so far
[2:10:16] Nico_vdM: imo start with a simple goal like ksm.  Then you can decide whether you want to go higher like 2.5k.  Then higher again
[2:10:21] ren0m: @theBroHam you can get another job, you can't get another S3 achievement :P
[2:10:26] Guffels: start with the next goal, if you are KSM, go for KSH, if you are KSH, go for 3k. Past 3k every 100 points is an achievement in itself
[2:10:34] theBroHam: Right?! Lol
[2:10:53] s_dawg1: You think rets run dev aura?
[2:10:58] s_dawg1: Lol
[2:11:47] theBroHam: As a ret main, never :P
[2:11:50] McGyverStyle: youd hope in a 30 they consider it
[2:12:49] Nico_vdM: They could've made auras baseline
[2:13:01] KrugsNRoses1: Server list is back up for NA at least. Good sign..
[2:13:30] theBroHam: @Nico_vdM this
[2:13:41] Nonyamuff: Ok...maybe I'm the problem then in the pugs 🤣
[2:14:04] McGyverStyle: @Nico_vdM exactly. just make them stances like warr/druid forms
[2:14:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:14:30] ren0m: synergy is strong
[2:15:06] Nico_vdM: The prices for boes on the ah has skyrocketed.  A 483 avoidance helm is now 2.5m
[2:15:17] anossXVIII: What was that addon that suggested talent modifications??? Seems crazy useful
[2:15:36] theBroHam: @anossXVIII it's called mythic + talent reminders iirc
[2:16:04] anossXVIII: tysm!
[2:16:05] Nico_vdM: Probably since hall of fame is closed and less peeps are raiding
[2:16:08] KrugsNRoses1: @anossXVIII https://wago.io/RCVtPLUrF
[2:16:29] KrugsNRoses1: @anossXVIII He linked it earlier
[2:16:37] codethename: Do we have any idea when s3 ends? My guild is 6/9m, CE is starting to seem unobtainable. Roster boss too strong
[2:16:55] ohlittlebrain: april/may sometimes
[2:16:59] anossXVIII: @KrugsNRoses1 amazing you da man
[2:17:27] poyc: probably a week or 2 after Mdi
[2:17:48] poyc: I would have guessed mid to late April
[2:18:06] theBroHam: yeah late summer is what they said for new expac
[2:18:19] codethename: Ah that doesn't sound too bad, thanks for the estimation
[2:18:25] McGyverStyle: i think there was a blue post about s4 shit being on ptr once 10.2.6 releases so maybe 1 ptr cycle after 10.2.6 releases
[2:18:32] sw0ngs: @poyc season 3 ends you mean?
[2:18:34] Guffels: we know 10.2.6 is march and season 4 will be 4-6 weeks after
[2:19:09] poyc: @sw0ngs yeah
[2:19:36] Guffels: although there has been some conflicting info. wasn't jailer CE available through season 4?
[2:19:49] The_Reemer: @Guffels nope
[2:20:22] sw0ngs: @poyc no way season 3 ends after mdi lol. Like everyone else is saying 2.6 will drop first, then a month or so season 3 will end

[2:29:27] lunatic1996: he didnt generate a soul for like 3-4 seconds?
[2:29:55] codethename: These super high keys seem so giga tilting, I'll stick to my 26s and 27s
[2:30:01] Guarok: What kind of monitor are you using right now?
[2:30:03] ren0m: Maybe you could get sponsored :)
[2:30:23] ren0m: And then, after you get 3.9k you can say it's because of the monitor
[2:30:40] Pinslate: i bought an oled monitor the last time you talked about it
[2:31:11] zerahaha: what can a good monitor do for you? i also dont understand this
[2:31:13] Kanin82: do you have color on your glasses? how much shaded in percent?
[2:31:16] Pinslate: looks insane, i already had an oled TV but gaming on it really is great
[2:31:49] bleeppblorpp: oh is HDR good for wow?
[2:33:21] codethename: I gotta update my processor, ryzen 3700x. Got a new UI and a bunch of WAs, make me lag like crazy
[2:33:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:33:29] ohlittlebrain: i feel like in wow the only thing you'll notice is if you have OLD hardware and upgrade to something made in the past ~3years or so
[2:33:35] Guarok: High refresh
[2:34:07] vinnysoftpaw: how about the alienware qd oled monitors?
[2:34:08] ohlittlebrain: 1080p > 1440 also is a pretty noticeable diff
[2:34:15] ren0m: Is there a big difference between 144 to 240?
[2:34:20] kennycuban: my first time I didn't notice because I was not using display port cable! LMAO
[2:34:37] theBroHam: DP cables do make a big difference imo
[2:34:40] Pinslate: true blacks and no backlight bleed on OLED is insane
[2:34:46] Guarok: I can't play at 60hz
[2:34:52] Pinslate: made gaming much more enjoyable for dark games
[2:35:05] Mythos24: Wow supports HDR?  Or did you enable "auto HDR" in windows?
[2:35:49] ren0m: I didn't have HDR enabled until now
[2:36:19] Whitewolf1441: hello jb
[2:36:48] ren0m: So I enabled it and everything looks grey
[2:37:44] ohlittlebrain: If its grey you most likely need to calibrate the HDR color settings?
[2:38:04] ren0m: I would guess so
[2:38:12] ren0m: but my monitor is not high-end by no means
[2:39:09] Guffels: im still running a 1080TI. I dont think I have ever hit 144 fps in wow
[2:39:29] ohlittlebrain: 80fps in vald is pretty good, i hit about 60-70 max
[2:39:51] Whitewolf1441: woah howd you do that??

[6:09:50] JmantheThief: so any damage during p2 carries over to p3 and there's a lot more going on during p3 that's going to reduce people's ability to deal damage
[6:10:02] Jaylight__: only p1
[6:10:13] Jaylight__: after p1 its all time based
[6:11:14] theBroHam: good pull
[6:21:24] madtrade2600: !best
[6:23:07] JonesOnWheels: C'mon J gimme a kill before i leave for work
[6:23:49] MicHawkh: THIS IS IT!
[6:24:00] MicHawkh: watch the frontal
[6:24:21] ghar__: do those moving orbs do anything lol
[6:24:41] theBroHam: @ghar__ a ton of damage. they put immunities on him
[6:25:01] ghar__: Oh, makes sense
[6:25:34] JonesOnWheels: @madtrade2600 think their 9% of yesterday is the best pull
[6:25:41] MicHawkh: !pulls
[6:26:58] kelly_mac06: @MicHawkh it's around 400
[6:27:04] kelly_mac06: best percent was 9%

[6:34:42] monntuu: wow good prog!
[6:42:55] IAmSolari: I got the legendary today so I am in superbloom jail
[6:44:07] yenny__: lego havers are evil
[6:44:11] yenny__: sincerly a non lego haver
[6:44:26] vilewow: do you guys double drop seed?
[6:44:33] vilewow: first roar?
[6:45:21] ub__: are u guys gonna win
[6:46:49] ub__: sounds like a yes
[6:46:56] ub__: so u have less seeds to blaze
[6:47:04] vilewow: if you double seed drop you carry 1 less seed overall
[6:47:15] vilewow: and you guys seem to have the damage to kill before 4th drop anyway
[6:47:39] vilewow: because corrupted seed drop every roar, not every "good seed" drop
[6:47:59] vilewow: so you'd essentially make p3 way safer by only having 3 seeds
[6:50:13] Maximum: I just tuned in
[6:50:14] Maximum: banger
[6:50:39] Maximum: JB just admit it you love this raiding stuff
[6:50:46] Maximum: why else would you do it so much?
[6:50:53] poopstain221: getting old Oldge
[6:51:09] kaspagre: @jdotb does it feel ass to not play same character raid and m+?
[6:51:11] nash25pl: best pull % ?
[6:51:18] madtrade2600: i hate to heal the adds
[6:51:20] pepviyuela27: 1 raiders from pepviyuela27 have joined! 
[6:51:30] sw0ngs: @nash25pl 9%
[6:51:38] Maximum: you should have gotten your first tier as disc in during spirtit shell ramp on a timer regardless of any damge going out
[6:51:45] Maximum: jingly keys baby disc
[6:51:50] nash25pl: BibleThump
[6:52:20] Maximum: okay but also you can probably imagine if you're a disc beast how fun doing this class on world first progression
[6:52:31] Maximum: if this is your main content it has to be the most fun class
[6:52:46] Maximum: you probably completely change the way you play from pull 1 to the boss dead
[6:52:57] Maximum: oh ya true
[6:53:01] yenny__: all disc priests i know are unhinged and have complexes
[6:53:28] madtrade2600: @yenny__ it's true
[6:53:35] IAmSolari: @yenny__ same here
[6:54:29] nlaes: being 2nd disc and having worse timers and barely any movement externals was fun this tier
[6:55:42] Xevenna: Anyone know what site hes using for tracking the timers for the cds?   lorgs.io is what some of us in our raid use. Ive never played disc though so not sure if its as helpful for them.
[6:55:57] Guffels: i loved the process of making timers for the last 3 fights but sometimes it really feels like playing timers instead of raiding. you ignore the raid health outside of ramp so often
[6:56:31] Xevenna: lorrgs.io
[6:56:50] Xevenna: sorry i mistyped that first time
[6:57:47] Jaylight__: this is awful for shadowfiend CDR
[6:57:53] ub__: please be the kill

[7:26:58] galinhoo: Someone probably forgot to watch their lines
[7:27:43] galinhoo: !best
[7:28:41] vilewow: you guys should double drop
[7:29:36] dumbdragon: that rl is dumb
[7:29:37] vilewow: it doesn't spawn 2 corrupted
[7:29:44] dumbdragon: indeed
[7:29:44] DariX90: if you drop 2 good seeds it wont spawn 2 corrupted ones
[7:29:52] DariX90: corrupted seed is based on the raor
[7:29:52] vilewow: it doesn't
[7:29:53] DariX90: *roar
[7:30:06] Zempre: twitch chat to the rescue
[7:30:08] vilewow: w chat
[7:30:10] DariX90: the new meta is to double dip good seed on 1st stack and you only have to carry 3 seeds the whole run
[7:30:28] DariX90: 4 good turns into 1 bad and 2 good ones
[7:30:29] Guffels: he only said it was chat so if it doesnt work he can blame us KEKW
[7:30:40] Reilinkz: why are you dropping 2 insta just to like have less people to deal with dodging  ?
[7:31:41] DariX90: yes, you have 25% less chance to fuck up P3 since there is 1 less overall seed
[7:31:41] Geekop_: Playing less seeds is better
[7:31:57] DariX90: only 3 possible insta wipes instead of 4
[7:32:36] DariX90: also, I hope your tanks are holding the 1st bad seed. Giga easy for them to dodge shit since they are the furthest away from the whole raid
[7:32:57] Geekop_: The tanks are not holding a corrupted seed
[7:33:04] DariX90: they should :)
[7:33:14] Geekop_: Indeed - they should
[7:33:31] Geekop_: They also have a DH playing a seed which I wouldn't do now id just have it all ranged
[7:33:37] DariX90: they can easily survive the stacks and they have the best spot to dodge shit not to insta wipe the raid
[7:33:55] DariX90: yea, holding bad seed in melee (on DH) is also really bad
[7:34:40] DariX90: we had 2x hunters holding the bad seed. If they don't make it to the roar stack, they can immune the roar and they wont die. Roar doesn't blow up seeds so holding it in melee is just harder since you have to dodge more lines/fire
