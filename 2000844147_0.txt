[1:21:54] Radund01: Just depends on the item.  And also you need to click his link.  It is possible it is a bug with the site.  I clicked the link when I did it

[1:50:12] Roamy01: Most of all, it's a show about a group of very flawed and traumatized people trying to suck less and allow themselves to overcome trauma. Counterbalance that with things like sentient zombie butt monsters, a literal street that gained superpowers and is genderqueer, and an insane super hero whose powers stem from flexing specific muscles (who accidentally makes the entire cast orgasm by flexing the wrong one).

My wizard got caught by the blast and barely survived, 5 hp left
