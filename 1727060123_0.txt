[0:11:52] HappyDuckGamez: just wondering, have you claimed on the website? it isn't immediate collect for the toy

[0:12:26] Lynoxian: It said that the item could take 24 hours to appear on your account
[0:12:28] Stabier: @ModeraYsera It is.  I've had it work for previous drops in November SirSad
[0:12:56] Cryste58: If its anything like the last drop, it can take up to 72 hours. And if you still dont have and you have done all the steps correctly, then contact support about it.
