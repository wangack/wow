[1:26:36] DrizzTV: You can chose the PvP Talent that makes Radiance an instant cast: A must for PvP
[1:26:36] EliBourne: That’s why priests are good in BG’s
[1:26:45] VxtFKU: Quick rundown; Atonement is applied by some of your abilities. When an ally has atonement, you DPS to heal your buddies
[1:26:50] nolifeAlice: people go lenience
[1:26:53] EliBourne: All the friggin heals

[4:35:32] Crumpdiddy: Swifty how do you stay so positive ? Any tips ?
[4:35:34] yutasuzukitv: holy is just better, but have fun dont be a meta slave
[4:35:36] Klako1: disc is much harder
[4:35:46] tgodqt: way harder but strongest
[4:35:50] tgodqt: disc is not really played
[4:35:52] taantrum2: you have to get attonement on anyone before you heal
[4:35:59] xx_kevin_escobar_xx: I think disc is easyier as holy
[4:36:24] bobdaboist: holy priest is absolutely busted
[4:36:40] clearscreen: @tgodqt if only that were true. Disc is only utilized for utility in pve, which is minimal. and pvp holy is FAR superior
[4:36:45] nightpanda07: holy priest is just miles ahead of every healer
[4:37:33] TwistinFool: what class you playing now? How has the warlock been treating you

[4:39:51] azrothlol: its lego
[4:39:51] Cynergi_: crappy lego
[4:40:09] Cynergi_: for the amount of damage it does... aint worth it
[4:40:26] Cynergi_: better going with suns PI lego if you want dps lego
[4:40:35] Cynergi_: so you and your target get PI
[4:40:58] Cynergi_: Twins of the Sun Priestess
[4:41:16] Semi99: yourself
[4:41:18] taantrum2: penance your friend and heal both
[4:41:27] Cynergi_: heals more on yourself , likely have to radiance as disc to stay alive with two melee on you
[4:41:29] Semi99: dmg is so high rn
[4:41:43] clearscreen: maker sure atone is up
[4:41:59] azrothlol: only do dps when no fear of death

[4:43:52] NoNameNamer: nvenc for streaming
[4:43:56] Cynergi_: why cant i post a tip lol what
[4:44:37] mr_goon: Use mouse over on your frame.
[4:44:46] Cynergi_: if your healing in arena you should have a bind to swap targets regardless
[4:45:01] yutasuzukitv: you can do like shifh heals u and alt heals ally
[4:45:05] alvintheonlychipmunk: is it a mouseover macro for penence you missing
[4:45:14] Cynergi_: partner 1-2-3
[4:45:21] taantrum2: if you just shield yourself you get attonement, then damage and you are healed automatically.
[4:45:43] Cynergi_: ya you gotta target yourself like doing all heals
[4:45:52] taantrum2: the damage heals you if u have attonement
[4:46:01] bigpanzerx: @taantrum2 its less healing that way
[4:46:20] mr_goon: Use the party frames with the mouse over. That’s how I use penance mouse over.
[4:46:22] taantrum2: mastery
[4:46:27] adidas_123: your self
[4:46:31] taantrum2: shield yourself and keep damaging
[4:46:41] adidas_123: in raids you heal trough attonements and in pvp you heal how you need to :D
[4:46:47] adidas_123: attonement healing is really weak
[4:46:55] adidas_123: but scales well with large raids
[4:47:00] Cynergi_: haven't played disc in a while cause i feel crazy playing it with how busted holy is.... love building my serentiy stun as holy . But thats the only fun part
[4:47:07] kempz: it mostly comes down to experience, its all very situational
[4:47:26] taantrum2: so not for emergency i see
[4:47:49] taantrum2: go to a target dummy and check
[4:47:55] alvintheonlychipmunk: you can make it so it mouse over heal the target you mouse is over and if you have it on nothing it cast on target
[4:48:01] Cynergi_: ya attonment than dark arking in rbgs is great

[4:52:03] Cynergi_: when you can greater fade outta abomb limb or spear of bastion... so op
[4:52:37] Cynergi_: gotta play holy for that
