[11:03:25] Joetis87: How many bars till you pass out on the keyboard?
[11:03:27] bongichong: Hello Swifty, if you are playing on a pvp server what is stopping a discord group of 50 rogues chasing you around stunning you off cooldown, impeding all your progress. But that is counteracted by a group of paladins and priests cleansing you and trying to assist you in progress. I guess I just dont understand the dynamic
[11:03:28] MrJesusChrist: but yeah aslong you are safe and not you know crazy you should be fine
[11:03:30] drevilqt1: this backdrop cant be a green screen is it?
[11:03:33] FONGHH: :o how do they get internet on cruise

[11:06:18] maverick_966: @warmjamdonut because its a valid question proven by statistics
[11:06:18] bongichong: @MrEffektAU I would imagine there are groups of people sitting in discord, waiting to sabotage a streamers, or anyone popular enough. Just impede their progress for hours or days on end. Requiring a support group to follow said player around, defending them from the onslaught. Essentially, causing a moving battlefield around the player that could last an indefinite amount of time
[11:06:22] MRuTV: how is hunter in WOTLK?
[11:06:29] hooza24: amber turds in that 1 tho

[11:32:03] MrJesusChrist: everyone was split. but I enjoyed it
[11:32:22] MrJesusChrist: they are bringing back the scar and I used it on the beta so satisfying
[11:32:25] Trobro: @itsbane no in warzone and in multiplayer currently heartbeat sensor has no charge, you just pull it out and use it. New game they are changing that
