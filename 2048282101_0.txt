[0:35:27] Moose_Ka: That got messed up
[0:35:33] misomander: people already complaining that p2 taking too long
[0:35:38] Sauzes: mythic doesnt I thought
[0:35:41] Deadge_Gartic: its 15 levels
[0:35:43] misomander: why delay the next phase by 1-2 weeks
[0:35:46] misomander: for p3
[0:35:49] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix 15 levels is like 1 day and you dont need prebis
[0:35:51] Moose_Ka: 25-40 is longer then 1-25
[0:35:51] Deadge_Gartic: to clear the raid
[0:35:59] Moose_Ka: to level
[0:36:07] Moose_Ka: So they should delay release so we can enjoy it
[0:36:11] insaniacc_: I dont like delay personally because I know I'm gonna hit max level within like 2 days anyway, so delay is just gonna make me bored for 5 days LULW
[0:36:13] Deadge_Gartic: savix
[0:36:14] Deadge_Gartic: i did
[0:36:16] Nicholas909: @insaniacc_ the first lockout for gnomer is 1 week after release
[0:36:16] Deadge_Gartic: on hardcore
[0:36:19] Deadge_Gartic: dont tell me you cant
[0:36:20] Deadge_Gartic: om
[0:36:20] Ipeca: P2 is to soon for the people that have 7 kids and are only level 12
[0:36:24] wreckstormx: LUL
[0:36:26] Deadge_Gartic: so 3 days max
[0:36:32] Deadge_Gartic: for normal people
[0:36:34] misomander: dude the people that asking for the delay gonna be 40 in 2-3 days anyway lets be real
[0:36:39] CigzIsTight: i'll suck it Gachi
[0:36:49] sk0q: Because if it comes out at an arbitrary date in the future, world first will just be whoever can log on first and don't get cucked by queues

[0:36:56] iamthedengus: World of Warcraft is a game for the unemployed
[0:37:01] subsonic_eye: it’s a compromise which them changing the lockout to 1 week so I think is a good  idea
[0:37:10] tummboi: savixOld cant believe people want p2 already, i have 17 kids and 3 wives so im still only level 21
[0:37:10] insaniacc_: I dont like delay personally because I know I'm gonna hit max level within like 2 days anyway, so delay is just gonna make me bored for 5 days LULW 󠀀

[0:37:13] Jiviex: To be fair. I’m still not max level. and haven’t had time to hit 25 yet.
[0:37:22] insaniacc_: @tummboi you're a houseman for 3 wives? holy
[0:37:26] wreckstormx: problem is the gamers are gonna clear it first week and then gonna run out of content after 1 month
[0:37:28] Nicholas909: both ways have the same amount of guilds tho

[0:39:39] Deadge_Gartic: 2 was bad
[0:39:39] amazingdinogamer: sadge
[0:39:42] heyimtazz: Well be doing the raid for weeks and week but only do 25-40 once (per character)

[0:40:22] Parcelazo: chat, did savix watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccaWy0Xh9-k From losbby
[0:40:23] paul_allenn: I don't play wow Happyge
[0:40:25] hoffa_fred: 2-3
[0:40:30] Parcelazo: @paul_allenn GIGACHAD
[0:40:31] Guenhyvar_: delaying it and making it an event to open the gates of gnomer would be cool
[0:40:32] amazingdinogamer: @KarlMorxy 2 and a half days
[0:40:33] iiTzCotty: I think they should release it 1 day before
[0:40:34] misomander: and no delay = more lockouts = more chances for loot. people STILL crying about not getting sword or staff and that would just make it worse in p2 since you losing lockouts with the delay
[0:40:36] vyoshi93: how are you guys casually walking through ratchet w/o horde f'n you up
[0:40:38] Moose_Ka: We are watching a classic wow streamer. We are in the minority of players. Expand your views to take into account people like my brother in law. He has two kids and works at a hospital. Alot of people are like him and they would enjoy having a week between release knowing they arent falling behind @Deadge_Gartic
[0:40:43] heyimtazz: Chat what is the juicer on the right side supposed to be?
[0:40:49] paul_allenn: @parcelazo Happyge
[0:41:05] Moose_Ka: We are gonna sweat it up anyways
[0:41:11] god0924: even retail delays it
[0:41:12] Moose_Ka: So why not spend time to getting pre raid bis
[0:41:12] happyphyzik: Is it worth to start SoD adventure now? How is the EU population?
[0:41:17] Deadge_Gartic: savix retail is infinitely harder then classic
[0:41:19] Parcelazo: chat, did savix watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccaWy0Xh9-k From losbby Looking
[0:41:24] Deadge_Gartic: you dont need prebis to clear the raid on classic
[0:41:26] Deadge_Gartic: not even max level
[0:41:31] iiTzCotty: Release 1 day before the patch drops.. trust me
[0:41:32] Tdoh__: @Moose_Ka theres no MMO in history that caters to people with jobs and lives, no game in history. lol
[0:41:35] Deadge_Gartic: people cleared onyxia bagden with green geared 58 s
[0:41:53] ImCakeAble: I agree mister @Savix
[0:41:55] heyimtazz: But leveling in classic is longer than retail
[0:41:55] subsonic_eye: maybe people will hate it and change it next phase, they are just trying shit
[0:42:00] Deadge_Gartic: no my point is
[0:42:05] ImCakeAble: We doing Darkmoon?
[0:42:06] Deadge_Gartic: you dont have to rush
[0:42:10] Deadge_Gartic: even without rushing
[0:42:15] Deadge_Gartic: you will at least 90%
[0:42:16] NinoLaRue: savixOld
[0:42:18] Kurama__95: OM
[0:42:18] Rugmouse: gotta get the weapon week 1 so we can complain p3 is too far away GIGACHAD
[0:42:19] Deadge_Gartic: yea cuz i fkng hate classic om
[0:42:20] misomander: wait for me i flew wrong place
[0:42:23] misomander: savixOld
[0:42:24] Traitmark: OM
[0:42:31] insaniacc_: To be honest, I get both sides. I personally dont want a delay, cuz i'm a sweaty fuck, but I understand why others want a delay
[0:42:32] Gokublue001: lol
[0:42:36] Moose_Ka: Savix play my last dono tts
[0:42:36] barskebaard: yeah shut up dude
[0:42:37] happyphyzik: Is it worth to start SoD adventure now? How is the EU population?
[0:42:38] sickish: @Deadge_Gartic DIESOFCRINGE
[0:42:38] KarlMorxy: @Savix do you think its a "rush" for most people to get to 40 in 7 days? it doesn't seem like such a rush
[0:42:39] Deadge_Gartic: lil bro 1 week delay is bad
[0:42:40] Deadge_Gartic: even for retail
[0:42:45] Parcelazo: bear with 2 days delay or a gorilla with 2 days of lockout @Savix
[0:42:52] FuegoleonW: i mean
[0:42:56] raekorx: tbh if they delay it, tryhards would still rush it to get as many alts to 40 as possible before 1st lockout.
[0:42:57] Deadge_Gartic: yea and i leveled like 50 times already deadass
[0:42:59] Deadge_Gartic: on classic
[0:43:05] FuegoleonW: a week to discover runes before raiding seems more fun to me
[0:43:10] god0924: @Parcelazo this!
[0:43:10] DeathToad007: i wll be 40 by sunday
[0:43:11] chickenbaggins: CatBop
[0:43:13] Kurama__95: Won't it release on a thursday and reset on tuesday?
[0:43:17] misomander: wait for me big bro i flew to the wrong FP Cryge
[0:43:19] Sauzes: It just seems they met in the middle, theres a population that enjoys the leveling rush and first clears
[0:43:24] Vesir_1: maybe waylaid supplies and bfd xp will make it feel less rushed?
[0:43:25] rick_morks: but is it that bad to miss out on 1 or 2 raid lockouts? the season will be on along time..?
[0:43:29] Moose_Ka: 25-40 in 7 days is a little fast. If you play like 2 hours a day
[0:43:31] Sauzes: and its the way it always has been and really wont affect the vast majority of people
[0:43:34] CigzIsTight: i think the compromise they made with the week long lockout for 2 weeks is alright tbh
[0:43:35] eddy9222: trap launcher will be op
[0:43:40] misomander: you gonna do it anyway
[0:43:42] the_erayyy: where are you going ? :D
[0:43:45] Rugmouse: do it Stare
[0:43:45] DumbledorSoD: Is this raid gonna be 3 day lockout resets like bfd?
[0:43:51] iiTzCotty: I need it delayed atleast a month so I can grind my levels!
[0:43:52] misomander: thats what alts are for
[0:43:53] Annurco: then dont
[0:43:58] KarlMorxy: @DumbledorSoD yes after the first two weeks
[0:43:58] Parcelazo: chat, did savix watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccaWy0Xh9-k From losbby
[0:44:01] heyitswugs: i found myself playing more constantly not getting bored when there wasnt a rush
[0:44:06] Sauzes: Then pace yourself lol
[0:44:06] DeathToad007: its going ot be 3 day lockout after feb 20
[0:44:21] misomander: pace THIS
[0:44:22] happyphyzik: Is it worth to start SoD adventure now? How is the EU population??? Guys???
[0:44:25] ImCakeAble: I will level for you sir
[0:44:26] PeSoWeLtEr: SoD ruined HC change my mind
[0:44:38] insaniacc_: I think thats because youre in the middle Savix you kinda wanna be like sweaty and do first reset, but you wanna enjoy yourself on the journey also, so you're conflicted. I think most people dont really care about missing 1 reset
[0:44:39] Shtonker: isnt the whole point, discovery? its not season of speed run
[0:44:40] misomander: arent they basically giving you one week
[0:44:47] subsonic_eye: a lot of people will take 5, 6 days to reach 40 and they will still make he first lockout
[0:44:52] kilan222: @happyphyzik its fine
[0:44:54] TheEndIsNear777: is this the REAL gigavix?
[0:45:05] Parcelazo: ahmadmuhsin savix is sweaty
[0:45:08] DumbledorSoD: we should just do a pvp raid on day one and kill all the horde trying to quest LUL
[0:45:08] Tdoh__: why are your action bars not centered underneath your character
[0:45:11] sickish: A lot of people don't want to miss first reset.

[0:45:36] ArchspireWoW: Theres that man and that hair <3
[0:45:37] wreckstormx: i  wanna have fun lvling, but also dont wanna miss out
[0:45:39] rick_morks: i honestly dont care to miss out on 1 or 2 lockouts. Most people will. Lvling an alt is the same, you missed multiple lockouts if you lvl it later
[0:45:45] misomander: i kinda like the extended lockout thing tbh
[0:45:52] misomander: i know im gonna hit 40 in like <3 days anyway
[0:45:52] highfiveguy: i play casually. i want a delay in raid release
[0:45:53] ArchspireWoW: No chat overlay on screen?
[0:45:57] mccan2110: are you gonaa main pala in p2 ?
[0:45:57] misomander: < 3
[0:46:00] Deadge_Gartic: 2 , i even think raid / m+ season should start day 1
[0:46:01] m3nkind: i would like that way at 40 do it 1 week at 50 and see whats best for 60
[0:46:03] Gokublue001: with full time job i lowkey enjoy longer period of patch
[0:46:06] Gokublue001: or phase
[0:46:06] Traitmark: im Oldge, idc anymore ... i would've gone for the delay approach though
[0:46:06] KarlMorxy: did you make a roleplay profile for savixd yet?
[0:46:11] insaniacc_: oh yeah savix u have no chat on your screen
[0:46:13] the_erayyy: can you Link your UI? which addon is this?
[0:46:14] insaniacc_: cuz u did youtube video
[0:46:20] ImCakeAble: I hate 3 days reset tamicat
[0:46:30] Moose_Ka: The average player absolutely cares about falling behind. Why would they sink there little gaming time into a game where they are always playing from behin
[0:46:48] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix retail season beginning feels extremely empty
[0:46:50] raekorx: yeah but they said they dont want a race lol
[0:46:50] Deadge_Gartic: nothing to do
[0:46:53] Deadge_Gartic: without raid release
[0:46:59] Deadge_Gartic: everyone played retail recently can back me up
[0:47:03] ImCakeAble: Wow I see myself
[0:47:04] insaniacc_: in retail it feels way worse cuz u dont level
[0:47:04] Deadge_Gartic: even insa was complaining
[0:47:06] insaniacc_: ur already max
[0:47:07] Deadge_Gartic: at the start
[0:47:13] misomander: idk we'll see
[0:47:16] insaniacc_: if there was leveling, maybe it was different
[0:47:19] misomander: we have very xp efficient dungeons for p2
[0:47:27] the_erayyy: can you link your UI? which addon is this? :)
[0:47:27] bvick218: What server are yall on?
[0:47:28] misomander: i honestly think people overestimating how long itll take
[0:47:28] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix literally i had 2 weeks of empty play time
[0:47:31] Deadge_Gartic: which i played other stuff
[0:47:31] Kurama__95: I like the 1 week delay, I just enjoy the outdoor content and take my time with the campaign
[0:47:33] FatMeetsFire: @Savix who won duel thingy
[0:47:33] nesbb: @SpicymisoTV which dungeons for ally?
[0:47:36] DumbledorSoD: Retail usually has some world stuff to do, but classic is all about doing world stuff, so i dont think waiting will make people quit
[0:47:39] DumbledorSoD: unless they just dont like wow
[0:47:47] misomander: @nesbb wym you just gonna spam SM like everyone else
[0:47:58] insaniacc_: @Savix in retail new season the problem is that theres no new content except for like a 3 hour questline. You're already max level etc. In classic you have some leveling, so I dont think a delay would be as bad
[0:48:05] barskebaard: 10 pts to gryffindor
[0:48:20] ordus55: @Savix  hey would you be so kind and help guzu playing a kids game :) he is struggling hard
[0:48:24] insaniacc_: i meant to tag deadge there
[0:48:26] sickish: Finding runes, professions super important, new pvp event zone
[0:48:26] insaniacc_: OM
[0:48:26] DumbledorSoD: thats what i meant lmao
[0:48:38] Guenhyvar_: id also imagine there are gonna be more quest aswell
[0:48:39] impkapp: PepeLaugh
[0:48:43] the_erayyy: UI Addon name Sir?
[0:49:06] Vetto_7: People will rush and then cry about they got nothing to do month after release :)
[0:49:08] insaniacc_: @Savix okay, so, do you think theyre actually gonna enforce the GDKP ban? 99% of the time it happens on discords and stuff anyway, I dont see them stopping this much
[0:49:10] insaniacc_: LULW
[0:49:11] barskebaard: but literally everything else about p2 im very positive about
[0:49:21] Moose_Ka: LOUDER
[0:49:24] ImCakeAble: Can I get a summon? tamicat

[0:49:40] Moose_Ka: aaaa
[0:49:46] insaniacc_: the profession gear they showed look broken as fuck for PVP
[0:49:53] insaniacc_: 10 sec immunity to interrupt and spell pushback?
[0:49:54] insaniacc_: hoooooly
[0:50:05] Moose_Ka: The holy pally chest piece is gonna be cracked in pvp insaniacc
[0:50:09] insaniacc_: bro we did it 3 hours LULW
[0:50:12] insaniacc_: me kleik liebe and fuego
[0:50:15] insaniacc_: last season atleast
[0:50:17] Deadge_Gartic: thats not only happening on new seasons @Savix xpac launchs are worse
[0:50:19] Deadge_Gartic: 2 weeks wait time
[0:50:24] rick_morks: its about 3 hours tho
[0:50:25] Deadge_Gartic: with 3 days worth of  do something
[0:50:29] brakealot: what about the auto pummeler 50% atk speed, kitty gonna burst
[0:50:30] ImCakeAble: I will report every GDKP I see
[0:50:51] gstyle914xp: Hey man wat was the announcements they dropped todayy for SoD  👀👀 I know I’m late f
[0:50:55] insaniacc_: thats what i meant

[0:51:28] funviking99: it’s the internet so people need to disagree all the time, so stupid
[0:51:28] kpflottarent: Savix, BTW, 지금 어디로 가시고 있어요?
[0:51:36] insaniacc_: @Savix bro did u see the plate chest from Blacksmithing, 10 sec immunity on kick and spellpushback. Holy Pala is gonna be insane
[0:51:40] deadkled: https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/blizzard-was-wrong-about-gdkps/493404/81

[0:52:04] rick_morks: gonna raid TB?
[0:52:07] insaniacc_: the nature damage mail piece looks super pathetic next to the other 2 OM

[0:52:48] paul_allenn: Smadging
[0:52:49] Tesla369: need vigilantes to infiltrate the discords and collect evidence
[0:52:51] shadowthehedgehog97: these gdkp andies probably also think having laws against murder is bad because people get murdered anyway
[0:52:59] StreamElements: If you enjoy the content check out my other stuff! https://linktr.ee/Savixwastaken
[0:53:16] insaniacc_: I feel like theyre not gonna enforce the GDKP ban, or atleast its gonna be very hard. Most GDKPs happen through discords nowadays anyway
[0:53:16] heyitswugs: gold was expensive back then
[0:53:24] ImCakeAble: Summon me sir tamicat
[0:53:29] paleflaws: BagdenHadToDoitToem

[0:53:53] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix i know some people leading 6-7 gdkps per week as a job and they are earning more then people with proper jobs LULW
[0:53:54] Moose_Ka: The GDKP defenders are saying that the price of consumes are going to go up cause gold buyers will have nothing else to spend gold on. Which makes no sense. They wont buy gold if they cant buy bis with gold

[0:54:53] impkapp: PepeLaugh bro blizzard needs to recruit real players to be undercover agents so they can be sure if gdkp is happening
[0:54:54] heyimtazz: imo gdkp would actually be sick in a perfect setting where RMT for gold was impossible
[0:54:54] flying_shithawks: rather do a gdkp and walk out with gold than spend hours in a SR or a CLC and get nada
[0:55:02] rick_morks: its good that it will be gone. There were barely any normal raids going
[0:55:04] shadowthehedgehog97: also why are they so afraid oh this happening one of ten versions of wow which is literally meant to try out new things
[0:55:07] konghellerud: im a new player... and now that i hit lvl 20g all nat.. then i talk to some other guys in guild and they are up 500 g :P

[0:57:07] ColePowerz: hello good sir
[0:57:07] fewme: like 30 lmao
[0:57:20] tummboi: i got buff and 5 druids straight out of jeffrey epstein's island killed me LULW
[0:57:20] fewme: i turned off guild names with a script uuh
[0:57:24] Moose_Ka: Cause they can just see when people trade gold for raid items soon after a raid
[0:58:01] Moose_Ka: Whats going to happen now is that they wont do it for gold. They will just bid money and paypal the raid leader
[0:58:01] dzhinn9255: !server
[0:58:01] StreamElements: dzhinn9255 SoD = NA Crusader Strike

[0:58:04] Moose_Ka: And then trade the item

[0:58:31] ColePowerz: there was Reddit post abt someone not getting hydra cause he mentioned he had a bis geared shaman lol
[0:58:35] Moose_Ka: @Moose_Ka I think the difference there is they wont be doing multiple trades of items and gold for like 5 minutes
[0:58:42] Moose_Ka: They will do like two death rolls
[0:58:45] catbalou2: Horde repaying for the ally cucks in Elwynn
[0:58:45] PaEu: what class have u had most fun on?
[0:58:47] krueger541: You will never get DMF from us stinky @Savix
[0:58:49] Tdoh__: @Moose_Ka wrong, i ran lots of gdkps with the soul purpose of earning gold. made 20 to 50g per gdkp. everyone in the gdkps did lol

[1:38:02] Moose_Ka: Lmao who cares what asmon says. He doesnt actually play the game
[1:38:03] themanjake2020: Its on the right track
[1:38:03] ShimmyYah: linen cloth will be the new gold
[1:38:08] Andiells: paypal raids will be back
[1:38:08] AverageGachiMuchiEnjoyer: They should make it so you cant trade gold in raids and remove 2h timer
[1:38:11] sickish: Fixing the issue 50% is better than fixing it 0%
[1:38:13] msfugsly: it will at least reduce the inflation but not completely eliminate it
[1:38:14] Deadge_Gartic: hard degen rmters still will do it
[1:38:17] Deadge_Gartic: but regular andy will stop
[1:38:21] Deadge_Gartic: which is good
[1:38:21] Vetto_7: I did two GDKP, got gold from doing quests at cap, but I respect their decision to ban it
[1:38:22] p3anots: GSR = Gold soft reserve, you spend gold to have more soft reserves OMEGALUL
[1:38:25] insaniacc_: @Savix https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FJWVFOEuWM this is why you should watch Asmon's reaction to GDKP LULW
[1:38:27] baldysheree: anyone who has a problem with gdkp being banned begged their mum for money for sod and now want to cry about it big bum sniffers
[1:38:30] Grashh: its like roadblocks, if you make gdkp harder it will stop an extra bunch of people but not the try hards
[1:38:41] senjoya: well hard degen are the ones who ruin the game
[1:38:42] Cryptoji_Jojoji: @MalachiteHotS resub i need timewalking LULW
[1:39:01] flying_shithawks: or what if you're in a guild run and you get an item and a buddy offers to buy it off you and you agree? this is just too open-ended and causes way too many more issues to happen
[1:39:02] updogtv: Mort is the TFT dev
[1:39:05] updogtv: he's dope
[1:39:07] tummboi: mortdog aaaa
[1:39:07] MalachiteHotS: @cryptoji_jojoji fuck wow LULW

[1:39:45] tummboi: only good riot dev LULW
[1:39:47] MalachiteHotS: The gdkp guys are just gonna make u trade them the gold before u go into the raid and make u bid in a discord server or something LULW
[1:39:51] Naboo69: savixOld baldist
[1:39:54] nikola420tesla: HAHAHA OM
[1:40:02] ImCakeAble: THAT MADE HIM BALD
[1:40:17] insaniacc_: that was just during his stream LULW
[1:40:18] ashe00s: that's why he's balding OM
[1:40:19] sickish: Mortdog is an absolute gem
[1:40:19] Dimichsky: they brought upon themselves when they made raid items tradable within 2 hours
[1:40:25] Deadge_Gartic: @insaniacc_ nah it was legit video
[1:40:27] Deadge_Gartic: i can link it
[1:40:28] themanjake2020: they cant advertise

[1:40:46] fuzzywuzzyqt: @ImCakeAble BASEEEEEEEEEEEEED
[1:40:48] lasagnalord13: 007 agents will infiltrate the discords and report
[1:40:52] p3anots: GDKPs are dead, GSR is where it at now, You spend gold for soft reserves. It is what it is!
[1:40:55] flying_shithawks: I wonder if this all happened because some blizz dev raged after losing out on a Hydra in a gdkp KEKW
[1:40:59] MalachiteHotS: @savix u should grab 3 guys right now and make them all trade u gold and whoever trades u the most gold keeps all of it LULW
[1:41:00] senjoya: I think in the case of GDKPS done this way, it would be a genuienly acceptable answer to just snitch them.
[1:41:02] StripSniper: I liked the opinion of the bald resto druid, go into raid, can't trade gold, go outside raid loot becomes soulbound
[1:41:05] Discoelysia: @ImCakeAble LUL
[1:41:11] flying_shithawks: THAT'S IT
[1:41:12] misomander: comix already furiously at work putting up a 5 min video of you reacting to that asmon vid

[1:41:25] insaniacc_: @Savix we're getting 10 or even more epics in gnomergan aaaa im gonna take every single one i can wear
[1:41:27] AverageGachiMuchiEnjoyer: 100% theres a dev in the GDKP discords
[1:41:28] Rugmouse: I do like they are implementing new bot practices along with the GDKP change - gotta address both sides for it to be impactful
[1:41:29] MalachiteHotS: Fun little gamba LULW
[1:41:32] spacewuff: im glad gdkp are dead :)
[1:41:33] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix this was the original video but kinda unrelated to the stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gylTfMAOYHI&t=0s
[1:41:35] Deadge_Gartic: its good react tho
[1:41:38] fuzzywuzzyqt: @SpicymisoTV does more work than another streamers editor I know.
[1:41:45] misomander: om
[1:41:45] sk0q: More epics = bad
[1:41:57] eb3ans: gdkp is so aids
[1:41:58] flying_shithawks: peacebloom raids inc
[1:42:03] StealthyNakroth: Why are they banning it in SOD but not WOTLK though? lol
[1:42:05] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix you saying this while not having full set btw om
[1:42:07] lasagnalord13: didnt ybarra do gdkps?
[1:42:09] AverageGachiMuchiEnjoyer: imagine just playing the game Aware
[1:42:10] senjoya: Well at least you can't advertise for them as easily nowadays
[1:42:10] fuzzywuzzyqt: I mean my lock is bis'd and I wanted to do GDKP for extra gold
[1:42:12] Deadge_Gartic: people go to gdkp to gear up fast
[1:42:17] p3anots: @sk0q Now that's a shit take
[1:42:24] AverageGachiMuchiEnjoyer: WoW token is why
[1:42:31] Andiells: WotLK have WoW Token
[1:42:40] flying_shithawks: @StealthyNakroth think of this as them testing on a guinea pig, they said the technology can be applied to any version of WoW
[1:42:47] Moose_Ka: They also sell wow tokens in wotlk
[1:42:47] misomander: anyone got a good DMF layer im still in mulgore
[1:42:58] fuzzywuzzyqt: Fried take, I think they should add a wow token to SOD
[1:43:00] melvinguyy: imagine if they add itin sod
[1:43:01] ashe00s: GDKP killed era and wrath
[1:43:05] Moose_Ka: @fuzzywuzzyqt om om om
[1:43:06] StripSniper: please add wow token, how will i feed my 5 wow gfs...
[1:43:17] flying_shithawks: just let players play how they want, no one's saying you can't do MS>OS, guild runs, SR runs, it's just stupid.
[1:43:21] Khalito94: south america mentioned
[1:43:26] heyitswugs: they have a reduced month sub depending on where you live
[1:43:32] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Moose_Ka I'm pretty fried but idk man I think it's a good idea ngl
[1:43:36] Deadge_Gartic: tbh current retail standarts gold kinda means nothing
[1:43:38] queefinators: make it so you cant sell wow tokens for gold, make it so you can only buy it with gold from the store not from players in the AH
[1:43:38] PeSoWeLtEr: south mexicans
[1:43:40] Deadge_Gartic: and it doesnt really hurt
[1:43:44] PeSoWeLtEr: meheecans
[1:43:44] Moose_Ka: @fuzzywuzzyqt How?
[1:43:45] p3anots: @heyitswugs there are always poor people in poorer countries
[1:43:47] spacewuff: does savix play on crusader strike?
[1:43:48] AverageGachiMuchiEnjoyer: I mean just go on ERA and see how bad chat is. You cant find a single group that isnt a boost or GDKP. cuh
[1:43:53] Kurama__95: A WoW sub is 40$ where I live pepeW
[1:43:54] Moose_Ka: You can buy tokens and then sell them to buy boes
[1:43:58] insaniacc_: "Let players play how they want" it is literally affecting the entire playerbase LULW
[1:43:59] Discoelysia: gdkp babies triggered
[1:44:01] melvinguyy: or they can decrease the price for those countries, its standard practice for a lot of online products/services
[1:44:03] insaniacc_: lets not let players play how they want
[1:44:04] mikgullll: Hey savix i rerolled from ret to ww hope the gods can forgive me :(
[1:44:14] Moose_Ka: @mikgullll no
[1:44:15] misomander: i think thats where i am now
[1:44:17] Deadge_Gartic: @Moose_Ka for retail that still doesnt mean anything
[1:44:21] p3anots: @mikgullll ww?
[1:44:22] Deadge_Gartic: boes are kinda garbo om
[1:44:22] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Moose_Ka Yeah but whats the difference between buying gold from the bots then buying from the ah?
[1:44:28] impkapp: ashbringerCNH
[1:44:37] fuzzywuzzyqt: the token I mean
[1:44:47] Moose_Ka: @Moose_Ka The solution for RMT shouldnt be make WoW Token
[1:44:52] Moose_Ka: They should try and crack down on it
[1:44:54] p3anots: Blizzard gets the money, duh
[1:44:54] mikgullll: @p3anots Windwalker
[1:45:00] Deadge_Gartic: tbh wow token was the best thing they introduced
[1:45:09] StripSniper: holy Nomulee is back
[1:45:13] Deadge_Gartic: i bought every xpac with gold
[1:45:15] Deadge_Gartic: baseg
[1:45:24] flying_shithawks: if they're going to be serious about it, they might as well just make GDKP servers
[1:45:30] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic Same baseg
[1:45:31] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Moose_Ka They already are. Its an up hill battle.
[1:45:37] sickish: You can tell Aggrend cares.
