[1:09:14] RudyRube: @Savix he didnt kill a single OG though only 12 newer HC players
[1:09:17] doctorsupra: @hashtagstronger no, on normal servers, just hc addon
[1:09:18] jackpepsimba: bet he smells like onions
[1:09:18] moraeds: if I recall, asmon said he doesnt care as long as blizzard doesnt care. Blizz could have absolutely done something, but they didnt
[1:09:22] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix asmongold had a good video on it tbh
[1:09:22] MalachiteHotS: @iol69 who even are u little boy

[4:30:30] Deadge_Gartic: dont @ me
[4:30:32] ImJstaMrTaco: almost everyone who dislikes cata is just wrong about why they disliked it or can't accurately say why
[4:30:32] Deadge_Gartic: BASEDHALT

[4:30:44] the_bronze_yasuo: @ImJstaMrTaco holy BASEDCIGAR
[4:30:57] dizzypeezy: @ImJstaMrTaco because dragon soul was the worst raid and lasted way too long
[4:30:57] Kuzu_Maki: wow sucks now tbh
[4:31:05] Deadge_Gartic: @ImJstaMrTaco dragon soul
[4:31:12] Deadge_Gartic: you dont need any other reason
[4:31:15] Deadge_Gartic: its pretty basic
[4:31:20] Gsuque: just dont raid it 4HEad
[4:31:22] Deadge_Gartic: firelands was banger tho
[4:31:46] paulinhozion: retail is for modern audience
[4:31:49] Naboo69: savixOld yeah firelands was pretty hot
[4:31:49] Shreddingly: I hope you will enjoy cata @imjstamrtaco and I hope you are happy that people who would bring negative vibes rather stay away from it :)
[4:32:01] ImJstaMrTaco: @dizzypeezy Almost every wow raid hell most of the raids in wotlk are worse than the cata raids
[4:32:06] Senzn_: when and what server is the duel tournament on?

[4:32:19] aceassination: I never played Cata when it came out and started playing again in MoP, so I'm gonna try it out this time around
[4:32:48] ImJstaMrTaco: cata/mop era shit on vanilla-wotlk
[4:32:53] Naboo69: savixOld i got tier pants from gnomer today
[4:33:16] Deadge_Gartic: @ImJstaMrTaco vanilla to wotlk raiding isnt really raiding tho excluding icc
[4:33:20] Deadge_Gartic: its just target dummy
[4:33:25] Tropicocity: I got the epic fist last night on my shammie, jsut in time for enhance buffs coming

[4:33:28] Naboo69: savixOld the leggings of the fang can finally retire
[4:33:33] dizzypeezy: @dizzypeezy there wasnt worse raid than dragonsoul
[4:33:36] Deadge_Gartic: icc then cata is first steps to modern raiding
[4:33:54] Tropicocity: NODDERS
[4:34:05] Deadge_Gartic: which started strong
[4:34:11] Deadge_Gartic: its just dragon soul tbh
[4:34:24] ImJstaMrTaco: @Deadge_Gartic True I literally did t5/t6 while falling asleep mid boss fight without dying and still doing top dmg
[4:34:42] Deadge_Gartic: @ImJstaMrTaco i'm not saying you are wrong btw , i know many people wanting to play cata again
[4:34:52] Naboo69: @Deadge_Gartic savixOld you suffer through all of dragon soul just to ride his back and fight his hands and head for a little while
[4:34:54] Deadge_Gartic: @ImJstaMrTaco i might also play a bit for dragonsoul
[4:34:57] Deadge_Gartic: i mean
[4:34:59] Deadge_Gartic: firelands
[4:35:02] Deadge_Gartic: fkng dragonsoul
[4:35:17] ImJstaMrTaco: @Deadge_Gartic People freak out about cata over this and hunter focus but dragon soul is like 1/4 of the xpac at best
[4:35:29] ImJstaMrTaco: Cata made healing fun and meaningful
