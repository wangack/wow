[0:08:54] erinnightz: it is about -6d were I am tonight would be about -12d we still have 12 inc of snow
[0:09:02] Zuldak: So i have a complaint for whoever set up these races in outland. WHY do we have to race through a massive briar patch?
[0:09:47] witchhobbit: no more snow and never got that much but we are getting cold now for a while
[0:09:59] Zuldak: its a randomize every time you mount
[0:10:01] Alkervah: It randomizes each time you summon
[0:10:05] McScooterson: @Zuldak probably the same human that had us go through razorfen downs

[0:15:27] McScooterson: blue tint
[0:15:29] Octopixy1971: blueish
[0:15:35] cashthb: I got all the golds on the auchindoun, you really should try it to, I'm sure you'd have a freat time! :)
[0:15:47] Zuldak: its the ozzy osbourn glasses his undead character wore in the commercials
[0:15:48] erinnightz: oh love a blue
[0:16:08] tonibeeswax: Good morning from LA!
[0:17:22] tommytheecommie: does the archives have a time gating aspect or can you just grind it out to max nonstop?
[0:17:43] McScooterson: I wish they'd tell us if/when we need to have stuff done for a meta meta
[0:18:01] cashthb: see not so hard? you can do the next on advanced, no issue
[0:18:17] jakefx1: hazelWave
[0:19:46] cashthb: last one I did half the people were afk and it net me like 1k fragments, doing it with 5 man last night was like 4k
[0:19:53] abhorrentascendance: How y'all doing from Tennessee
[0:20:12] Ujai321: Morning. How was Mean Girls?
[0:20:18] Darkalius87: I did the quest twice for Outlands cup (gold on all base races first time) and got all the rewards now
[0:20:31] cashthb: 20 quick pushups
[0:20:58] GreenArrowed: delivery people are still on their bikes here
[0:21:06] McScooterson: fun is right. our building's entrances are an incline either way so getting kiddo to bus stop was a time
[0:21:08] GreenArrowed: it's so so icy
[0:21:13] Asreyya: I can't wait for dragonriding on rest of the mounts lol
[0:21:17] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:21:21] 7thSaga: Hazel LUL
[0:21:24] Ujai321: But the streets are free? Or did people start pushing their cars as well
[0:21:32] diarrhea_lad: howdy folks!
[0:21:56] Darkalius87: The Manuscript of Endless Possibilities doesn't seem to be account wide though
[0:22:09] CanadianHeavy: Ya more racing
[0:22:30] McScooterson: the digs seem to be on the hunt model yeah
[0:22:34] cashthb: "last one I did half the people were afk and it net me like 1k fragments, doing it with 5 man last night was like 4k" - me, like 4 minutes ago; it goes way slover when noone that gets the tasks do them
[0:22:49] wolfcloudchaser80: I did a big dig 100% alone last night. I still raked in a lot of rewards.
[0:22:54] Zuldak: that is not true. People who just AFK are assigned tasks and if they dont do them then it slows down the dig
[0:23:20] ghostie1995: dragon riding with other people makes me nervous because I feel like it gets competitive lol
[0:23:33] McScooterson: I dunno if it was just THAT many people, but it took ages to get a task during the big dig
[0:23:42] McScooterson: was free to just round robin the lil digs
[0:23:51] 7thSaga: Dig Dug!
[0:24:09] cashthb: arriving like 1-2 minutes into the dig seems like the strat
[0:24:13] ghostie1995: Doug Doug!
[0:24:20] berlolive: hey is this in the middle you Energy bar weak Aura ?
[0:24:26] diarrhea_lad: like 80% of my guild is at MAGfest this weekend so there's no raid this weekend, and I've got major FOMO. feels bad, man

[0:26:04] Darkalius87: Just got the Spectacles from Gilneas ^^ I had my worgen use the worgen only toy to get there :)
[0:26:08] Zuldak: there is one really bad spot in one of the SMV races...

[0:26:50] Streamlabs: anarchymoose just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:26:51] cashthb: I liked those dailies, few things felt better in the game than assasinating invincible after spending 2 hours running icc with no drop
[0:27:02] Ujai321: Would he be allowed in the office by now?
[0:27:39] maachen: Morning, Hazel! These are open! I know what I'm doing tonight.
[0:27:43] cashthb: yeah, you could even do it with regular flying
[0:28:02] macydoes_: noob question. where do u start the archives?
[0:28:08] honeybun_games: we have 3 feet of snow‚Ä¶ I miss Victoria ü§£
[0:28:11] mirandaplaysgamesss: fastest way to get dream warden rep?
[0:28:23] IAmScarlett__: hazel you dont need mounts
[0:28:25] Ujai321: Just wait until he realizes that your puny gates are no match for his 100 pounds Kappa
[0:28:25] IAmScarlett__: you want mounts
[0:28:39] widdlywhee: I take it Moose and Kira are not besties? Aww...
[0:28:40] Zuldak: You should also do the time gated Ochre Dreamtalon thing too. Its not hard but just check in on a tree
[0:29:15] widdlywhee: Fair. I don't like people jumping on me either.
[0:29:48] ghostie1995: I can understand I love dogs but bigger one that jump and have big energy kind of overwhelm me
[0:29:55] diarrhea_lad: Big Bundle of Gummi Worms was my nickname in college
[0:30:01] Ujai321: The last update was like: moose thinks Kira is a weird looking dog, and Kira thinks moose smells bad
[0:30:52] widdlywhee: Took my dog (bless his soul) about 2 years before he realized not everyone loved getting humped and jumped and started to respect it. But before that... total teenage boy.
[0:31:11] Balkov_WG: IS THAT A CAT? its huuuuuge
[0:31:32] jakefx1: hazelShiny
[0:31:32] Darkalius87: Apparently I was super lucky with my Lord Godfrey glasses, got it in like 5 throws xD
[0:31:37] ghostie1995: lol moose is great though he‚Äôs being himself to the fullest :3
[0:31:44] widdlywhee: Kira isn't huge, Hazel is smol
[0:31:46] Balkov_WG: handsome cat
[0:31:55] MrSonicgen: Hello all.
[0:31:56] Ujai321: With that kind of perspective work, you could work on another Lord of the Rings
[0:31:57] frenchvoiceover: frenchvoiceover subscribed at Tier 1.

[0:32:12] memlon7: my cat and I are watching your stream.  it is so dry here there is static whenever I pet my cat.
[0:32:13] cashthb: wait until he finds out that people are yummy
[0:32:21] wolfcloudchaser80: Hazel has altitude
[0:32:29] Balkov_WG: Yeah I was thinking either a perspective thing or huge cat
[0:32:38] widdlywhee: I know you're tall, just a silly comment in Kira's defense ;p
[0:32:38] Balkov_WG: or maybe Im just used to small cats?
[0:32:39] Ujai321: It's amazing man
[0:32:40] IAmScarlett__: i have the uyrge to watch game of thrones
[0:32:42] IAmScarlett__: is it any good
[0:32:46] Ujai321: Filmmaking is just pretty cool
[0:33:01] Ujai321: 50/50 Scarlett
[0:33:18] Ujai321: The good things are amazing, and the bad things are atrocious
[0:33:38] Ujai321: Start with season 1 and see how you like it
[0:33:44] Balkov_WG: @widdlywhee Defense? I didnt mean anything bad about it :D
[0:33:48] Phenroi: You have an objective!
[0:33:57] IAmScarlett__: @Ujai321 the bad things? that being season 8?
[0:34:13] widdlywhee: @Balkov_WG I know ;)
[0:34:32] Ujai321: Ye, that is bad
[0:34:47] widdlywhee: I haven't watched Game of Thrones at all except for a "All Daenerys scenes" compiliation on YouTube and loved her. But the rest kind of never interested me for some reason
[0:34:58] kaur_q: you are bugged?
[0:35:15] BiFfMaIsTeR: deliver it back to Ed
[0:35:19] Phenroi: Check the minimap, it tells you yto go elsewhere
[0:35:26] Zuldak: some of the tasks he gives you for the dig are bugged. Like i was told to pull 6 weeds. Only 2 spawned
[0:35:37] Tuk87: hello Hazel, are you rockn a wig? :)
[0:35:44] IAmScarlett__: @widdlywhee i watched some cersei and daenerys scenes
[0:35:45] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:35:45] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:35:50] IAmScarlett__: safe to say i prefer one over the other
[0:35:57] ivashkov92: Hello Hazel and chat üòÉ
[0:36:25] Tuk87: @HazelNuttyGames are you tryin to grow back your own?
[0:36:53] widdlywhee: @IAmScarlett__ Is that the one with the walk of shame?
[0:37:10] IAmScarlett__: @widdlywhee no just dragon pit stuff
[0:37:10] Balkov_WG: gearing with the new upgrade system is crazy fast
[0:37:43] IAmScarlett__: oh hazel! how was your day
[0:37:45] IAmScarlett__: yestyerdya
[0:37:45] widdlywhee: @IAmScarlett__ No I meant the character. The crazy one with the short hair?
[0:37:51] ivashkov92: I‚Äôve been doing alright! Have a five month old puppy myself so been having fun with that!
[0:37:58] diarrhea_lad: I'm glad conquest will be uncapped next week. I really wanna complete the DK set
[0:37:58] IAmScarlett__: @widdlywhee oh yeah
[0:38:08] ivashkov92: currently leveling my Worgen to 70 so I can do the Gilneas quest line üôÇ
[0:38:28] IAmScarlett__: @ivashkov92 you can do it on anyone
[0:39:35] widdlywhee: @IAmScarlett__ I think I remember that dragon scene with her. Other than that I only saw her at the very beginning of the show in a scene involving her brother and was scarred forever. If she was the one with the brother and I'm not mistaken, that is
[0:40:23] wolfcloudchaser80: Glowy blue things
[0:40:48] Tuk87: Whats is this event?
[0:40:49] wolfcloudchaser80: Ohh, that's probably the mob to kill
[0:40:58] diarrhea_lad: Maybe the little critter pooped out the clue after 5/5?
[0:41:26] IAmScarlett__: is there only one dig?
[0:41:32] IAmScarlett__: and is it at this specific location?
[0:41:42] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, seems random
[0:41:46] Zuldak: you can see what color the next book is at the top. it is random
[0:42:02] Hulkhokie: superbloom feels like forever
[0:42:09] cashthb: they do take half the time of a super bloom
[0:42:28] widdlywhee: Cheer100 In lieu of a channel points redeem, my payment for a possibly off-screen boop for the certified best boy of all the dogs, Mr. Moose
[0:42:28] Streamlabs: widdlywhee has donated 100 bits!
[0:42:32] diarrhea_lad: I think there's just more to do during this compared to Superbloom. Like, if someone else alreday grabs weeds you're just kinda sitting there
[0:42:34] 7thSaga: savixHypers Hazel i got a Clayscale Hornstrider from that dig :)
[0:42:40] McScooterson: superblooms are 15+ minutes
[0:43:01] zaligirl731: Hello!
[0:43:15] GreenArrowed: they're so boring to sit through
[0:43:24] Balkov_WG: superbloom more like supersnore. I was in despair when I was doing them for my leggo.
[0:43:37] zaligirl731: I haven't done any of the ne stuff yet. How is it?
[0:43:55] wolfcloudchaser80: I just bloom-gather on superblooms. The fighting is so boring.
[0:44:04] HolocronCoder: O god, it's Outland
[0:44:07] IAmScarlett__: i nearly cried at one of the cinematics
[0:44:14] Hulkhokie: where does the outland cup start?  shift+J?
[0:44:23] Skrewtaype: Same! I am less guilty now!
[0:44:57] Hulkhokie: ok so many new quests and I have no idea where anything is
[0:45:34] LoreLannister: What do you get for doing the outland races?
[0:45:37] Balkov_WG: The best scheduled event they did was probably time rifts so far imo. Kinda odd how they missed the mark on superbloom.
[0:45:45] alexastone29: Clap2
[0:45:54] widdlywhee: I miss having a dog. But it's impossible for me to have one, working full-time and living alone.
[0:46:03] jeffdmk: reverse and advance are free as long as you dont care about getting a gold time
[0:46:41] Zuldak: the stupid briar patch is not a free race... stupid branches everywhere
[0:47:49] Zuldak: i did think it was really cool we saw outland nagrand in a BFA cinematic with Saurfang and Thrall
[0:47:52] cashthb: having to wait for the seeds is the dumbest idea, idk how that made it to live
[0:47:59] widdlywhee: It's insane how far we've come. Dragonriding in Outland. Truly mindblowing
[0:48:15] Phenroi: I think the total currency for everything is like 267k
[0:48:16] Zuldak: 1500 more fragments for the mount...
[0:48:29] s7wede: I would still love them to have indicators on your screen that give you a hint to where the next checkmark is, if it's not already on your screen. Something that many racing simulators do for example
[0:48:39] Zuldak: Skari needs that 2h mace
[0:48:40] vharakh_17: i think you only got to silver on that last race
[0:48:46] Hulkhokie: i do my seeds while i'm eating lunch, that way I plant, and wait while i eat :P
[0:48:58] Zuldak: Barnaclus could also use it too
[0:49:18] Zuldak: well you were healing with barn
[0:49:58] MrSonicgen: Weeeeeee
[0:50:17] jeffdmk: the quests are brutal out here
[0:50:22] GreenArrowed: i level in hellfire as long as i can
[0:50:25] GreenArrowed: i love the music
[0:50:26] cashthb: you'll have to do it in cata classic anyway
[0:50:51] syniron: hellfire was always brutal at 58 in quest greens
[0:50:56] Balkov_WG: love tbc leveling warts and all
[0:51:03] anker_jym: Hazel, as a Gnome enthusiast, how do you feel about the Night Elves and Worgen getting homes, but Gnomeregan is still an irradiated mess? We need justice for the Gnomes!
[0:51:23] heldtheline: Kira taking her place on The Throne.
[0:51:31] alannatriste: Kitteh does not recognize break.  This is their time to shine.
[0:54:20] Zuldak: I remember being terrified of the random felreavers stomping around
[0:54:27] widdlywhee: Zangarmarsh also had the best ambience and music in my opinion
[0:54:33] diarrhea_lad: shoutout to Hemet Nesingwary
[0:54:36] GreenArrowed: lots of flying bombing quests
[0:54:40] GreenArrowed: my fave
[0:54:48] heldtheline: I still need to get a firefly from that zone.
[0:54:56] eielwind: nagrand was so good for that
[0:54:57] cashthb: you like the kill 100000 ogres quests in blades edge?
[0:55:07] Balkov_WG: oh yeah, love a good kill 20 something quest
[0:55:59] philcabinet: I wanted trhe Spore guys to be playable
[0:56:20] philcabinet: them and Arrakoa not being playable is such a miss
[0:56:22] GreenArrowed: this was my first rep grind area, grinding for the hippogryph mount from cenarian circle or whichever it was
[0:56:26] Balkov_WG: My must have pet on every character was the Sprite darter hatchling
[0:56:34] philcabinet: Sporelings I thought
[0:56:57] eielwind: I despised blades edge pre-flying
[0:57:09] GreenArrowed: same
[0:57:23] bobbab5: Sporeggar EU was my 1st realm when I started playing back in '07
[0:57:27] philcabinet: BC has the most 'they should be playable races' of any expansion. Arrakoa, Ethereals, Ogres, Sporelings, Broken
[0:57:43] eielwind: I like netherstorm a lot
[0:57:44] bobbab5: My bad for choosing an RPPVP server though
[0:58:02] GreenArrowed: there was that rep grind for the etherials or whatever? i quit pretty early
[0:58:02] philcabinet: Mok'nathal too
[0:58:07] Typhurin: Need to do the Ogre rep in that place still.
[0:58:17] cashthb: I always tought nether storm is the coolest zone when I was young
[0:58:33] Ziami: I cant stop thinking that the spikes look like a scalp under a microscope xD
[0:58:37] HolocronCoder: Imagine if not only that, but the quest transmogs were retroactively granted
[0:58:50] Ziami: Yes!
[0:58:52] Ziami: Hair
[0:58:55] anker_jym: See, I was always the opposite when it came to Outland. It was always an alt graveyard to me. When they allowed you to choose between Outland and Northrend, I'd always pick Northrend. Seeing these races does make me a bit nostalgic though lol
[0:59:11] dergNwolf: ooooh outland races, how are they?
[0:59:18] anaya909: i'd bet nobody else has ever thought of that
[0:59:24] GreenArrowed: lots of vehicle quests
[0:59:28] eielwind: we get a northrend cup in a couple@months too right
[0:59:34] dergNwolf: tundra had way better questing than fjord yeeeee
[0:59:36] philcabinet: As a Warcraft RTS nerd, going to Outland was such a huge deal but I think it aged horribly
[0:59:49] Balkov_WG: Am I missing something but why are you not using surge?
[0:59:57] diarrhea_lad: I wish I could live in Fjord and Grizzly Hills
[1:00:06] eielwind: zul drak is F tier zone for me
[1:00:08] tofuwizard: The music for Basin is awesome
[1:00:11] GreenArrowed: the troll dungeons in wraath are still my favorite troll dungeons
[1:00:24] anaya909: sholazar is my favorite because i once mc'd my friend in a duel and drowned him in sholazar lake
[1:00:24] philcabinet: I like the Troll DK questline in Zul Drak
[1:00:35] Balkov_WG: Oh.. yeah I mean spinny
[1:00:39] Balkov_WG: I thought that was surge
[1:00:47] dergNwolf: I'm very interested to see how Last Titan plays out if we're really going back to northrend
[1:00:49] wolfcloudchaser80: Spinny isn't great, the best is Skyward Ascent when you CAN use it, but sometimes it bonks your head.
[1:00:56] diarrhea_lad: Actually, if y'all could live anywhere in the WoW universe, where would you wanna live?
[1:01:26] dergNwolf: I hope so
[1:01:35] Balkov_WG: I hope we get more races
[1:01:36] diarrhea_lad: I think we'll still see them
[1:01:40] GreenArrowed: they're fun and easy to get done
[1:01:40] philcabinet: Valley of the Four Winds
[1:01:43] eielwind: gollllld
[1:01:43] dergNwolf: YEEEE
[1:01:46] wolfcloudchaser80: Outland Nagrand would be pretty scenic to live in.
[1:01:48] Hippwn: if you do a quick look up with the  camera while doing the upward one that gives lots of speed
[1:01:49] riatla7: why would they put them in the old world if they werent considering it ?
[1:02:14] philcabinet: I would fall off Nagrand
[1:02:15] cashthb: i sure told you, then you went "idc", then you ran out of vigor and I was like "told ya", and then you went >:(
[1:02:17] eielwind: did you mean going forward like in TWW
[1:02:21] philcabinet: I miss the barrel daily from MOP
[1:02:36] dergNwolf: as long as it's not the hot air balloon photography world quest I'm okay with them
[1:02:38] ivashkov92: I don‚Äôt think we will
[1:02:44] dergNwolf: the thaldraszus hot air balloon can die in a hellfire tho
[1:02:52] ivashkov92: think those will remain DF WQ. but I could be wrong.. they are popular
[1:02:53] dergNwolf: yeee we need puzzle wqs back
[1:02:55] OfficalJiggyBrain: Wow it's been a loving time since I watched your live streams
[1:02:58] eielwind: i still have it on my todo list to gold every single race in DF and it‚Äôs just a monumental effort now
[1:03:01] cashthb: didn't the emberald dream had photography wqs?
[1:03:01] vharakh_17: Barrel o' fun and magic of flight in legion
[1:03:06] Balkov_WG: @philcabinet I miss mop just in general, can we skip cata and just go to pandaria straight away? :D
[1:03:12] Hippwn: legiion kirin tor puzzle quests could be fun too
[1:03:19] dergNwolf: there are no redeeming qualities to the thaldraszus one ;w;
[1:03:20] amy_star_a: Agreed! No balloons!
[1:03:21] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[1:03:31] grieze: Whenever 10.2 came out, for a brief period there was an onyx skin for the new netherdrake that appeared in the rostrum for customizations, did that come out with outlands races?
[1:03:33] mayer2911: i need way more stuff for the archives to do!!! :( i love it
[1:03:36] OfficalJiggyBrain: Are you still doing raid boss guides?
[1:03:47] Hippwn: I hated the ride the mana saber one
[1:04:07] vharakh_17: i think the only one i truly liked was barrel o' fun WQ's
[1:04:11] OfficalJiggyBrain: I didn't get Into Dragonflight
[1:04:17] ghostie1995: I‚Äôm almost done with this meta achievement in nazjatar but I need one yellow matching WQ and I have not been lucky in finding it every time I log in
[1:04:24] cashthb: the barrel one was also horrible, the animation was soo sloooow, messing up in the third round made me just stop
[1:04:26] dergNwolf: soooo how fun are the outland races? :3c
[1:04:30] wolfcloudchaser80: So for those who have done all the Outland racing, which course is the hardest?
[1:04:39] OfficalJiggyBrain: Probably because I hadn't played in over 2 years
[1:04:46] dergNwolf: they have tough competition for me because the goblin zeppelin city one in twilight highlands is BY FAR my favorite
[1:05:05] widdlywhee: Terokkar Forest must be the most difficult one. All those trees LUL
[1:05:15] ahnn112: i think some of the zaralek archive wq are bugged
[1:05:16] cashthb: auchindoun advanced 100% not even close
[1:05:49] eielwind: the randomizing manuscript intrigues me
[1:05:50] OfficalJiggyBrain: Onyxia raid is my favorite still trying to get my mount from there have you gotten it?
[1:06:01] cashthb: the only other I had to try trice was the last one you did, I spent like 2 hours in the auchindoun
[1:06:35] traktordestrucktor: traktordestrucktor watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! !
[1:07:20] cashthb: i thought you'd love the manuscript
[1:07:23] Zuldak: I dress like a clown in game and dang it i want my drake to match
[1:07:46] eielwind: I can‚Äôt wait to dynamic fly on onyxia
[1:07:50] Terra___l: @cashthb i gave up on that..
[1:07:53] wolfcloudchaser80: Auchindoun? Guess I'm in good shape, then. 2/3 done there, about to start reverse.
[1:08:00] mcxoney: what would be rarest mount you own?
[1:09:07] cashthb: @wolfcloudchaser80 on gold? there were a lot of people struggling there when I did it
[1:09:09] wiffysniff: what does the data have for the soaring spelltome?
[1:09:22] ProffBallsac: did you farm for the honey weapon
[1:09:44] kuro_nekoma: @HazelNuttyGames What addon is that with the % ect ? o_o
[1:09:54] tonibeeswax: the book mount is so fun
[1:10:24] kuro_nekoma: Thanks ! :D
[1:10:34] GFairyGaming: I've been trying to get the Blazing Drake on and off for a couple of years now. It's the last one I need for the Awake the Drakes achievement
[1:10:34] ProffBallsac: Nice, I thought about going for it but don't know how much time I want to put into it
[1:10:40] tonibeeswax: do you have a favorite tavern or calm spot in WoW?
[1:11:23] wolfcloudchaser80: @cashthb Yup, 3/3 gold now. There are some dry spots for boosts, but I can make up for it with height gain.
[1:11:25] Essiandar: I had a nice calm spot but then Iridikron destroyed it...
[1:11:28] eielwind: @GFairyGaming SAME, I'm at about 150 tries for it now and i cannot stand dragon soul anymore
[1:11:36] Balkov_WG: reckon dragonflight will have a veilstrider type achievement?
[1:11:36] Phenroi: @GFairyGaming That one took me over 250 runs to get, I hate that raid lol
[1:11:37] DoctorOgenki: i wonder who the least talked to , interactable, NPC is in the game moon2WOW
[1:11:37] Zuldak: some times you wanna go where every body knows your name... and they're always glad you came...
[1:11:46] Zuldak: sorry thats the cheers theme
[1:12:02] traktordestrucktor: Can you do the gillneas thing on horde?
[1:12:11] favver: nice feral druid on your side <3
[1:12:22] foss1lstreams: hey hazel! hope you're having a good day!
[1:12:22] traktordestrucktor: same rewards?
[1:12:26] cashthb: its a bit rocky
[1:12:47] Balkov_WG: This part is janky
[1:12:56] nyrhalahotep: @cashthb Solid foundation, though
[1:13:11] Terra___l: and on both site finally Lord Godfrey's Old Spectacles
[1:13:20] sanguinette: Have you done the Glowblossom yet and I missed it?
[1:13:40] Atomicpanda: seems like only worgen can get it. at least i was watching a stream where a worgen got it and a night elf didn't.
[1:13:48] sanguinette: Ohhhhhh
[1:13:53] Atomicpanda: the toy i mean
[1:14:15] ahnn112: if humans looked like tess in the cinematic i would swap to one immediatly
[1:14:18] FrostDBeers: Is it worth doing the dig event more than once a week on the same character?
[1:14:21] ivashkov92: People said the toy shows up in your collection but is only useable by Worgen. or is that not the case?
[1:14:27] ivashkov92: either way I‚Äôll be doing it with my Worgen so..
[1:14:29] sanguinette: It's a sprout near the Emerald Dream camp, and it's a long grind with many steps to end up with a unique mount
[1:14:51] ivashkov92: the humans look pretty good already though. the customizations they added for them are top notch
[1:15:02] Ryok: i was just 0.015 seconds off of gold on the skettis race girldmSad
[1:15:04] Ryok: reverse*
[1:15:09] FrostDBeers: ty
[1:15:13] lighthalo11: wait what mount?
[1:15:36] sanguinette: It's called the Crystalline Glowblosson, the mount is called...
[1:16:16] Atomicpanda: doh. wow's updating. this after my internet's been out for like 12 hours.
[1:16:21] widdlywhee: I read that as Crystalline Glowbottom :D
[1:16:22] the_rethan_family: I already got the random drop mount from the archivist event^^
[1:16:38] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames Do you know how to unlock the new cheetah fast travel form? idk why it‚Äôs not just part of the base kit but it shows it as unlocked but the source information won‚Äôt load.
[1:16:41] ivashkov92: üòÜ
[1:17:11] nyrhalahotep: @Atomicpanda OMG
[1:17:17] christabelle: @ivashkov92 It didn't just show up for me, but I also read on wowhead you need to click on the actual flower item for it to then show up
[1:17:32] Atomicpanda: apparently they fixed the booty shorts on the new worgen mog set. sothat's cool.
[1:18:13] ivashkov92: @christabelle Ahhh
[1:18:14] l_Denix_l: definetly
[1:18:14] tonibeeswax: (yes)
[1:18:14] Zuldak: always need the booty shorts
[1:18:15] wolfcloudchaser80: @sanguinette Is this something very new? Googling that term only gets me a clickable object.
[1:18:31] Atomicpanda: yes
[1:18:57] Atomicpanda: well the 3D parts of the pants were 2D so it looked really weird
[1:19:10] anker_jym: Now I want French Fries....
[1:19:17] christabelle: @ivashkov92 Yeah and I missed it so I gotta go back, lol - don't be me! xD
[1:19:29] sanguinette: @wolfcloudchaser80 Just looking to see if I got the name correct
[1:19:39] christabelle: You can also fish up a new glasses mog in Gilneas while you're out there!
[1:20:12] Atomicpanda: oh, initializing, why are you so slow?
[1:20:16] Zuldak: you have the helm thing in your bag
[1:20:19] the_rethan_family: I really like that we now get weekly charges of the catalyst. Since there is no other way for Evoker to get the belt or boots of their tier-set -.-
[1:21:08] eielwind: i think i *really* hate the new quests lol
[1:21:38] ghostie1995: I also feel that way in a new patch but I take twice as long due to my adhd like brain
[1:21:46] cashthb: honsetly I'm just impressed they managed to make archeology worse
[1:21:53] Zuldak: sorry the outland race started. For the technoscrying WQ you have the helm for it in your bag still. i kept trying to talk to the NPC dranei lady for liek 5 min before i saw it
[1:23:04] dicemeister23: Just got the Winter Night Dreamsaber! :D
[1:23:05] ivashkov92: People were discussing in T&E stream that the Archives event is likely the replacement for archaeology going forward but I‚Äôd rather it return as a profession opposed to an occasional public event..
[1:23:07] Pathstrider: did u see that better mining/herb nodes sparkle now on the mini map?
[1:23:20] dicemeister23: Aslo hi Hazel hope you're having a nice day
[1:23:24] sanguinette: @sanguinette Smoldering Sprout! and after 23 days you get the Reins of the Ochre Dreamtalon
[1:23:48] eielwind: have we found a "reason" for the archive rep yet?
[1:24:03] Zuldak: Yeah this feels like its own thing from arch
[1:24:13] Zuldak: though technoscrying is kinda similar
[1:24:29] ivashkov92: Well good..because I want my archaeology back xD
[1:24:43] wolfcloudchaser80: I think there's several things they regret making "evergreen features," like Jewelcrafting, Inscription, and Archaeology.
[1:24:46] Atomicpanda: there was nothing wrong with archaeology. with they'd kept putting it in. some of us really liked it.
[1:24:49] eielwind: oh sorry i meant do we get rep rewards? i know yesterday we werent sure
[1:24:51] slanther30: speaking of arcology i just got the septer of azj'aqir finally :D
[1:25:14] Zuldak: watch you get some legendary ring with 550 ilvl stats for being exalted with the archive...
[1:25:15] wolfcloudchaser80: @sanguinette Aha, yeah, that looks neat. Looks like a ground only, but very nice colors.
[1:25:59] Zuldak: i mean there are some pretty irrelevant reps in the game
[1:26:14] Zuldak: looking at you Ravenholdt
[1:26:19] Atomicpanda: five levels of rep and all i got was this t-shirt
[1:26:20] ivashkov92: @wolfcloudchaser80 Yeah.. those professions kinda got left behind
[1:26:29] eielwind: its for the insane title @Zuldak :D
[1:26:36] eielwind: (last one i need cuz i cant stand to do it)
[1:27:25] Zuldak: @eielwind get a rogue to the isle of quel'thalas and pick pocket the murlocs. Put on some youtube and just mindlessly get it
[1:27:42] Zuldak: JCs had freaking lariets. They made BANK this expansion
[1:27:54] Zuldak: do you have any idea how much the latiets made JCs?
[1:27:58] eielwind: JCers also had the forbidden reach ring
[1:28:23] Phenroi: I freaking need that pattern on my JC, so hard to get
[1:28:27] McScooterson: JC only made bank if you got the recipe early enough
[1:28:29] rock769: inscription can do runes, they are very expensive
[1:28:30] Zuldak: Now engineering... thats a prof that got left behind
[1:28:42] GreenArrowed: i make good gold just from making gems
[1:28:54] Zuldak: let them use their bombs in dungeons
[1:28:57] Zuldak: and it would be fun
[1:29:01] McScooterson: If you were lucky enough to get it before the 10.5 bug or had oodles of dough to buy it on AH
[1:29:45] Atomicpanda: they just need to add more cosmetics to professions, toys, pets, mounts, mogs, (furniture for our houses) etc.
[1:31:21] Nillraac: Where do you do this archive stuff?
[1:31:28] Atomicpanda: ugh. updating still not updating.
[1:31:41] Nillraac: Thank you!
[1:31:48] Zuldak: there is also a breadcrumb in the adventure journal suggested content tab
[1:31:58] Kaseyfullofjoy: yah we had those issues too
[1:32:03] rock769: archives as start
[1:32:22] Atomicpanda: ouch. so it's not just me.
[1:32:40] eielwind: we havent had a 2nd one drop either, even for people pugging in guild
[1:32:48] the_rethan_family: I love how Godfrey's glasses look.
[1:33:17] Zuldak: they remind me of the ozzy osbourn commercials for wow back in the day @the_rethan_family
[1:34:27] eielwind: the researchers under fire meta seemed just awful to get
[1:34:34] anker_jym: Calling it now, the first time Hazel runs Aberrus as a legacy raid on her Evoker, the legendary item will drop.
[1:34:44] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[1:34:56] Atomicpanda: it's updating! it's updating! 46% wooooooo!
[1:35:18] jeffdmk: what do you decide to do in game is so random
[1:35:58] Monicaisblue: im fine with zereth mortis being at the bottom of that list, then
[1:36:08] Zuldak: your group needs more druid
[1:36:11] wolfcloudchaser80: Many things can be summed up with "seems fun."
[1:36:35] jeffdmk: druids are fastest
[1:36:37] christabelle: easy to get around on a druid!
[1:36:46] Zuldak: because druids do it for the love of collecting not wearing or using
[1:36:56] christabelle: Plus they're nice in this event for the speed boost for everyone to run from pile to pile xD
[1:37:01] Zuldak: my record is 6 tomes
[1:37:02] Hippwn: I think it has more to do with what class is popular at the time and druid are popular this pathc
[1:37:09] Nnamu: what in the world is going on lol what did i miss
[1:37:10] cashthb: just take away flight form and it fixed.. also give it to mage to whom it belongs!
[1:37:14] Zuldak: interact key
[1:37:17] christabelle: Interact key!
[1:37:23] Phenroi: I use the interact key
[1:37:28] christabelle: I hit F and just...let it go, lol
[1:37:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup, interact key.
[1:37:45] christabelle: \o/
[1:37:47] HeylenR: wait, theres an interact key?
[1:37:49] McScooterson: is anyone else having the hardest time picking up speed in the Auchindoun races?
[1:38:03] anker_jym: What was your favorite public event out of the many they introduced in DF?
[1:38:04] WitchiMurloc: this looks so funny lilyidHaaaapy
[1:38:30] McScooterson: It wasn't this slow on ptr so wondering what got changed
[1:38:47] Morghella: @McScooterson yes! cant get adv. gold or reverse gold
[1:38:49] christabelle: @McScooterson the amount of people probably
[1:38:52] Zuldak: @McScooterson you got to do the ascent when you cross the middle and go up in the coaster race.
[1:38:54] christabelle: and yeah I have yet to have a task
[1:38:54] widdlywhee: Yes, chef
[1:38:57] anker_jym: I liked Soup and Time Rifts too!
[1:38:58] HolocronCoder: My first event, I never got a task
[1:39:04] Zuldak: it seems like managing the orbs is the key for it
[1:39:16] wolfcloudchaser80: You'll be excavating 80% of the time when there's TONS of p[eople
[1:39:22] marbared: I got stuck on pulling weeds w/ no weeds when I tried it. made for a boring excavation
[1:39:43] Ryok: @McScooterson i somehow golded normal and advanced auchindoun first try but can't for the life of me gold reverse D: was 0.015 seconds off so i said screw it if the reward is good enough i come back
[1:39:53] Nnamu: show the xmog
[1:40:02] cashthb: @McScooterson yeah, probably latency
[1:40:12] McScooterson: @Ryok did you do vertical take off?
[1:40:13] christabelle: @marbared If you fly out of the excavation area and back  in you can reset your task
[1:40:20] Nnamu: stylish
[1:40:26] wolfcloudchaser80: One of my weeds was under a dig pile that was spawned for another task. I had to clip through it to find it
[1:41:00] marbared: @christabelle Oh, great to know. Thanks for the hint!
[1:41:09] Monicaisblue: just got the chicken from a tome pog
[1:41:38] cashthb: @McScooterson I didn't
[1:41:42] BoogiePonderosa: do ppl mog to established sets usually? I can't ever get mixed styles of plate to work together...
[1:41:54] samdra1990: One can also press the % bar to start digging, instead of the piles.
[1:41:57] GreenArrowed: that whole last segment of superbloom is so so long
[1:42:07] cashthb: btw just got the mount from a book thingy
[1:42:15] cashthb: *blue thingy I meant
[1:42:18] Zuldak: i would laugh if there was a rare spawn end boss who is like the lich king in the timerifts and just starts wrecking groups
[1:42:36] dicemeister23: In your opinion is is better to purchase time rift mounts or farm them? I am returning player so not sure how easy farming is
[1:43:00] eielwind: i couldnt get clicking the bar to work either
[1:43:09] Zuldak: nah dont be a clicker. Interact key wins
[1:43:11] Morghella: i thought the digs were supposed to be every half hour or something
[1:43:17] Ryok: @McScooterson pretty sure i always just run off and spam 1
[1:43:18] GodfatherScooby: Wait I was suppose to do stuff in the cavern's other than get the glyphs? Well carp
[1:43:24] GodfatherScooby: crap*
[1:43:40] dicemeister23: Fair point I didnt even think about the horde and alliance mounts... I need to continue farming at LEAST until someone gifts me one
[1:44:03] anne42: where do you start the Outlans cup?
[1:44:19] nathan1227870: Are you excited for earthen dwarves to be playable?
[1:44:44] Zuldak: I want to play the humanoid nerubians
[1:44:48] Zuldak: they looekd neat
[1:44:56] marbared: I was having a hard time finding someone to gift the opposite faction mount on my small server - everyone already had it (this was weeks ago)
[1:45:09] AngryInternetCat: Naga would be amazing
[1:45:10] Nnamu: i want tuskarr so badly
[1:45:15] Phenroi: Tuskar, we all want playable Tuskar
[1:45:19] christabelle: I've wanted dryads forever, but I have no hope for a quadruped :(
[1:45:21] dicemeister23: What class would you play as centaur
[1:45:23] Zuldak: Naga is possible if they gave em a high elf visage form like dracthyr
[1:45:25] cashthb: I want playable cows
[1:45:31] christabelle: Hard pass on Tuskarr for me, lmao
[1:45:31] Zuldak: would solve the mount problem
[1:45:48] Catebot: Ive wanted to play an Arakkoa since BC
[1:46:14] dicemeister23: I vote centaur rogue.. if tauren can do it why not!
[1:46:20] BoogiePonderosa: LUL
[1:46:33] Zuldak: Naga would be a nightmare for mounts... nah just give em a high elf visage and it's fine.
[1:46:40] cashthb: not lame humanoid cow, I want quadrupedal-pilled dairy kings
[1:46:48] dicemeister23: You mean there are MOOSE around there
[1:46:49] PyahPyahPyahSoda: Have you explored the new night elf city yet? :)
[1:46:52] lighthalo11: id wanna play as the sethrak
[1:46:56] marbared: I wanna see the animation for centaurs trying to sneak around all stealthy.
[1:46:57] cashthb: yes I had to look up quadrupedalism
[1:47:05] WitchiMurloc: if we ever get murlocs i will be over the moon. we won‚Äôt but it‚Äôs my dream. they would be so silly in the best way, i can imagine my murloc shaman
[1:47:14] christabelle: Ugh it's SO PRETTY. And I'm excited for the weapon mogs.
[1:47:23] eielwind: kind of disappointing the NE city has...no quests or anytrhing just mog to pick up
[1:48:11] Phenroi: This WQ was bugged for me, the third item to find never appeared
[1:48:13] cashthb: @eielwind it has more portals tha most capitals tho
[1:48:13] BoogiePonderosa: no one wants Kobolds?
[1:48:23] AngryInternetCat: We have dog people, cat people when?
[1:48:32] Zuldak: id actually like ogres to be a playable race
[1:48:34] BoogiePonderosa: no takey candle!
[1:48:40] widdlywhee: I will NEVER tired to say this: Playable Tuskarr. <3 <3
[1:48:42] christabelle: centaur cat people xD
[1:48:43] widdlywhee: *tire

[1:48:48] 7thSaga: LOL <3
[1:48:48] GreenArrowed: oh sneezy
[1:48:51] the_rethan_family: It's still weird that there were those encripted Draenei NPC's on the exodar that have been removed and were never mentioned since.
[1:48:52] christabelle: Boy I sneezed about 10 times earlier too xD
[1:48:54] buckybarkes: i thought you were lagging for a second lol
[1:48:54] Nuraalek: I like Wacky Races too- Dastardly & Muttly were my favoourites (and now I feel old!)

[1:49:05] 7thSaga: Aww i wanted to clip that LUL
[1:49:07] wolfcloudchaser80: I sympathize, Kira. I also get sneexures.
[1:49:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Err, sneezures.
[1:49:16] spivet: what were those wod cat guys called? in tanaan
[1:49:39] dicemeister23: I would like another alien race like the Asura from Guild Wars 2 (not exactly like them, but something other than Dranei)
[1:50:02] christabelle: Oh the bipedal ones were Saberon yeah
[1:50:05] Ryok: i have NO idea how anyone thought the razorthorn rise race was good... literally the worst race ever
[1:50:14] cashthb: @dicemeister23 orrcs
[1:50:32] Hippwn: The Feral Druid Saberon form was cool would be neat if they brought it back
[1:50:37] toothpick45: VoHiYo
[1:50:57] Sindorein1124: watch and listen for the little ping sound and light thingy
[1:50:59] abhorrentascendance: Hey Hazel, do you play any retro games? I've been down an SNES rabbit hole lately of nostalgia
[1:51:24] Nnamu: how is your map so high quality lol i feel like mine looks worse
[1:51:25] AmiYuy: Did you turn off glasses and back in2?
[1:51:28] AmiYuy: On?
[1:51:42] Sindorein1124: I had a bug where objectives were outside the defined quest area, so I'd leave the area and the objective would despawn
[1:51:51] cashthb: it would be a real shame if someone were to gank Hazel rn, just saying, really don't want to give anybody ideas
[1:51:59] Kaseyfullofjoy: holy spam
[1:52:04] diarrhea_lad: yikes
[1:52:10] Kaseyfullofjoy: rekt.
[1:52:21] witchhobbit: woah
[1:52:33] witchhobbit: slowly doing it haha
[1:52:36] anker_jym: WoW turns 20 this year, is it considered retro yet?
[1:52:55] wolfcloudchaser80: That happened in another stream I saw today. I'm getting someone is using a new bot/technique.
[1:53:01] dicemeister23: are you guaranteed a time rift reward first TR of the week? I have 5 of those items that grant a reward but do I use on first one or save for second?
[1:53:09] anker_jym: Pretty sure that's the same for cars as well
[1:53:13] Kaseyfullofjoy: that was a heckin raid of spam
[1:53:16] Zuldak: wow that was interesting
[1:53:22] kynlaeh: never seen that before
[1:53:28] witchhobbit: haha
[1:53:29] toothpick45: LUL
[1:53:32] tehl00py: wow that was a lot lol
[1:53:40] indithedog: LuL
[1:53:42] ghostie1995: I was so confused for a sec
[1:53:44] Veryontron: I just got a cat! I haven‚Äôt had one in 17 years so it‚Äôs going be quite the experience.
[1:54:07] abhorrentascendance: I played Chrono Trigger and Link to the Past a lot as a kid. Was nice to get back into that
[1:54:22] WitchiMurloc: i replay my old pok√©mon games
[1:54:53] Sindorein1124: Chex Quest?
[1:55:01] dicemeister23: I am replaying Kingdom Hearts right now, also trying the handheld remasters for the first time
[1:55:07] cashthb: tetris still holds up!
[1:55:10] anker_jym: Kira is very visible today. She wants her internet fame lol
[1:55:22] spivet: wow is the only game I played as a kid that I still play a lot of. I do sometimes revisit stuff from the 2000s but not often
[1:55:22] Zuldak: so i just realized there is an actual quest for these outland races... and i have gotten gold on like 8 of em already >.>
[1:55:23] Hippwn: call me, beep me, if you want to reach me... lol that theme song
[1:55:26] Sindorein1124: Yes clicky fish game was great
[1:55:28] Ryok: blizzard just added a new shop pet üëÄ hoplet
[1:55:29] GreenArrowed: bejeweled is still my favorite video game ever
[1:55:35] wolfcloudchaser80: I'd love to get Zelda/Link to the Past going again.
[1:55:38] GreenArrowed: it's just such an excellent time sink
[1:55:40] diarrhea_lad: Man, I miss browser games
[1:55:41] Neltalie: omfg i have it on steam too, soooo fun
[1:55:42] nathan1227870: any old super mario game still holds up. Feels fresh even today
[1:55:49] dicemeister23: Hold up, browser games.. I used to be obsessed with Neopets, you just brought back some memories LOL
[1:55:51] abhorrentascendance: Hey some of those were hard. Disney's Aladdin and Lion King nearly gave me an ulcer
[1:55:54] High_Potency: Do you have a command or a list somewhere of all of your addons?
[1:56:01] GreenArrowed: aw bun bun
[1:56:06] WitchiMurloc: soo cuteeee
[1:56:09] HazelNuttyGames: !addons
[1:56:09] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:56:10] buttercup8404: is there an addon for the bronze timekeepers
[1:56:20] High_Potency: TY
[1:56:20] alannatriste: such a cute lil bun
[1:56:35] christabelle: saaaame
[1:56:43] GreenArrowed: yea
[1:56:46] anker_jym: Club Penguin, anybody?
[1:56:49] diarrhea_lad: I would spend waaaaaay too much time on Gaia Online
[1:56:50] GreenArrowed: neopets was such an experience
[1:56:59] christabelle: I tried to recover my old account a few years back and they were like 'oh we're in the process of deleting that account' :(
[1:57:02] GreenArrowed: mom, i gotta go get my omelete, stop interrupting me
[1:57:04] nerd14nerd: is the archive thing still bugged?
[1:57:09] Perkolate: LUL
[1:57:16] christabelle: I wanted to see my old Neopets...it's so much better as a site now, lol
[1:57:19] buttercup8404: ty
[1:57:32] diarrhea_lad: I actually met several friends because of Gaia that I'm still in touch with after all these years
[1:57:35] Neltalie: gaia online was for sure a pedo heaven
[1:57:44] christabelle: Our school had something in place to block sites like Neopets and kids figured out how to change IP addresses or the like and route around it to get to Neopets.
[1:57:54] witchhobbit: i miss my webkinz lol
[1:58:18] dicemeister23: My true pre-wow game was Toontown... I spent so many years of my childhood playing that lol
[1:58:23] tehl00py: first internet friend came from neopets. met her irl on a family trip, we were both preteens thank GOD but what was i thinking
[1:58:52] tehl00py: subeta anyone? neopets but not neopets
[1:58:57] sarj313: i had tamagochi, that was really nice ! :D
[1:58:57] High_Potency: You have inspired the collector in me( to a much smaller degree). I only had the Mage class hall done. Now done on Warlock, Warrior, Druid, DH, and Shaman.
[1:58:58] goplacidly56: lol
[1:58:58] christabelle: Yes, Cheat!
[1:59:01] christabelle: I LOVED that
[1:59:12] witchhobbit: tamagotchi was the best
[1:59:17] witchhobbit: loved the ds game too
[1:59:26] mardokun: loved to play trivia on mIRC :D
[1:59:34] toothpick45: i remember those days
[1:59:43] McScooterson: are you resetting the goggles after each find?
[1:59:47] GreenArrowed: i was addicted to neopets solitaire
[1:59:51] Danoria: Still amazed my parents let me play one of the Leisure Suit Larry; really,  though,  I'm amazed they brought my brother the game
[1:59:51] s_0lst1ce: did you check the platform at the edge
[1:59:53] abhorrentascendance: I'm old enough to remember Digimon as a tamagotchi like pet and Pokemon : Pikachu
[2:00:25] FrostDBeers: it took me a while to find this one too
[2:00:34] mardokun: when in doubt /reload
[2:00:38] goplacidly56: is the gold dot on the minimap for anything
[2:00:41] maplelost: bugged quest?
[2:00:48] spivet: I did some legion WQs recently on a new warlock alt I was doing the campaign on, and boy do I miss legion WQ design. A lot more straightforward
[2:00:55] goplacidly56: oh ok
[2:01:14] GreenArrowed: @spivet i thought legion bonus quests were really well designed
[2:01:20] cashthb: the best browser games were the fancy pants adventure games, they hold up really well
[2:01:27] s_0lst1ce: that is where I was thinking, I found something there that took ages to find
[2:01:48] Mkidm5: have you ever mythic raided
[2:02:07] Danoria: I miss the turtle WQs
[2:07:09] scottierippin710: DUDE major shout out for your youtube keypad videos! Still some of the best keypad content out. What are you using now days?
[2:08:31] McScooterson: On the other hand, what was the last event you attended
[2:09:00] 7thSaga: i hold both clickers to run :)
[2:09:06] christabelle: oh wow that doesn't feel that long ago...
[2:09:21] 7thSaga: outside is scary anyways LUL
[2:09:29] tehl00py: home is the best nodders
[2:09:59] sarj313: what rest? :D
[2:10:38] themaykr_: i hate packing and stressing out over logistics
[2:11:02] sarj313: for me thats the most fun part :D
[2:11:13] anker_jym: These Archives intro quests sure do take a while, huh?
[2:12:23] themaykr_: why travel in real life when you can travel in azeroth (and northrend, and shadowlands, and...)
[2:12:40] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm an aviation nerd, so I enjoy flying.
[2:13:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Though it makes me a plane-snob. "Oh, this flight used an Airbus A320? How boring."
[2:13:35] GreenArrowed: i need to do that. we're going to mexico this year and i don't even know where my passport is.
[2:13:58] anker_jym: I do really want to go to Blizzcon again someday. Blizzcon 2017 was one of the funnest trips I've ever taken. Especially since we got two WoW announcements for the price of one! (BfA and Classic)
[2:14:24] tehl00py: my passport expired last year. i lamented, it was only used on a ‚Äústudy abroad‚Äù aka party abroad trip for like 4 months :p
[2:15:10] witchhobbit: oh its so good
[2:15:20] indithedog: what are the best graphics to lower for fps boost
[2:15:57] themaykr_: enable FSR
[2:16:09] witchhobbit: do you have anything off right now?
[2:16:47] themaykr_: @HazelNuttyGames i suggest enable FSR in advanced, big FPS boost if u need
[2:16:53] BraveToTheBone: Always keep Shadows and other stuff w/o particles and textures
[2:17:00] BraveToTheBone: Always keep Shadows and other stuff w/o particles and textures off
[2:17:16] BraveToTheBone: oops i forgot there's no up arrow edit Kappa
[2:17:25] anker_jym: Man, I should look at turning some of those settings down. Valdrakken is a slide show most of the time
[2:17:39] themaykr_: its like DLSS, but the AMD variant, downscales resolution but uses algorithms and/or AI to upscale the image back to target resolution, game looks the same and u gain FPS
[2:18:39] Nnamu: whatt no 120hz at least
[2:19:08] themaykr_: for 4K not enabling FSR is a big loss TBH
[2:19:34] BraveToTheBone: @HazelNuttyGames u are in 4K even on FullHD VoHiYo
[2:19:40] themaykr_: ok true KEKW
[2:19:59] Night__________: My AI Gnome Engineer     ***
[2:20:02] themaykr_: but usually you gain about 20 fps and more
[2:20:19] mrsrockguru: evenin @HazelNuttyGames and chat,  I love these.
[2:21:00] Kurama__95: I wouldn't be mad if the new archeology is based off the Archives, feels more engaging than the current one
[2:21:00] mrsrockguru: Just about to do my first big dig
[2:21:15] BraveToTheBone: Kappa
[2:21:24] Proxzo: i didnt know the wood dragon was a dragonriding mount
[2:21:27] Proxzo: whaaat
[2:22:06] BraveToTheBone: I wonder who will turn off dynamic flying in TWW
[2:22:10] christabelle: I'm a Year of the Dragon bb and I have been WAITING to see what Blizz would do for Year of the Dragon...I'm not disappointed.
[2:22:10] BraveToTheBone: it's a downgrade
[2:22:24] BraveToTheBone: unless u wanna go UP, than regular flying is top
[2:22:55] DaMapleMoose: makes a few of my friends sick
[2:22:59] BraveToTheBone: same
[2:22:59] Essiandar: Wow history is gonna be divided into pre-DF and post-DF. It really is a watershed expansion in many ways
[2:23:04] christabelle: I like switching, yeah
[2:23:08] FrostDBeers: same
[2:23:11] mrsrockguru: still not unlocked the normal flying in df
[2:23:24] luckfore: dragonflying makes me motion sick so yeah -.-
[2:23:25] Kurama__95: Regular flying is better for something like picking treasures or just AFKing in the air
[2:23:35] wolfcloudchaser80: Olf flying is only at an advantage when you want to do a lot of starting and stopping, or pause midair.
[2:23:40] christabelle: It *is* nice for precision landings and hopping between nearby herb nodes, etc.
[2:23:44] wolfcloudchaser80: Err, *old* flying
[2:24:08] anker_jym: Emerald Dream is kind of a pain for dynamic flying imo. Too many trees and branches to get stuck on. I usually just regular fly there
[2:24:21] christabelle: I'm excited to get dynamic flight on certain old mounts though. Like the pinecone dragon we got with the DF expansion that wasn't a dragonriding mount for some reason, lol
[2:24:34] christabelle: @saviorofazeroth eh, just use ascent and get above branches
[2:24:42] christabelle: ascent gains speed quickly too
[2:25:00] Kurama__95: Dragonriding races trained me to avoid branches LUL
[2:25:30] themaykr_: @luckfore aren‚Äôt there motion sickness options now
[2:25:41] flyingsolow: It's broken. I had to turn WM on to finish it
[2:26:08] Kurama__95: Man, I wanna do keys but I'm scared of how they broke Afflicted and how much of a pain it's gonna be savixKEKW
[2:26:48] Blatsphemare: maybe something to do with the rep?
[2:26:50] alannatriste: oh, so fun.
[2:26:57] alannatriste: the adds are targets for aug buffs
[2:27:04] Kurama__95: It's now an NPC, so bosses can target it with abilities. Ppl think it's because of the NPC dungeons
[2:27:07] mantooth11: I noticed ancient teachings heals afflicted this week on my mistweaver.
[2:27:24] SaraDivine: last night in yazma an afflicted created a soulrend soul
[2:28:24] Kurama__95: The requirement for the Divine Breath thing to drop in the dungeons is just renown 25, right?
[2:28:27] Nnamu: i did one follower dungeon and a dwarf fire mage jumped backwards into another patrolling group
[2:28:53] 7thSaga: feeding time got me some fries and nuggets fresh from the oven and im dipping them in Doritos Dip Spicy Nacho Kreygasm
[2:29:07] anker_jym: Have you done the follower dungeons yet, Hazel?
[2:29:50] Kurama__95: Might be acc-wide
[2:30:09] Kurama__95: Also, did you see the transmog you get through fishing in Gilneas?
[2:30:38] Calaxandra: Is there a specific spot to fish in Gilneas?
[2:30:54] Kurama__95: Wowhead just says in the waters of Gilneas
[2:30:56] Killdozer77: I got it on my second cast
[2:31:54] luckfore: wheres the big dig?
[2:31:55] christabelle: I've seen people say they got it in 4, and some got it in 200 casts
[2:31:55] Kurama__95: Doesn't seem rare, not a Pond Nettle situation LUL
[2:31:56] Killdozer77: I don't think it's a rare item
[2:31:59] jesteross: jesteross watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[2:32:03] Blatsphemare: i got it just after 10
[2:32:05] ghostie1995: some people are fishing near Liam‚Äôs grave
[2:32:06] solkana: I got my spectacles on the bank near Aderic's Repose.. After like 60 catches.
[2:32:34] christabelle: some people claimed it was only in one spot on the first day, but wowhead comments say about anywhere in the area, like canals, etc
[2:32:40] Ryok: somehow the blade's edge race is impossible for me D: easy gold first try on normal can't even get silver on advanced or reverse
[2:32:45] solkana: Fly back
[2:32:46] GodfatherScooby: fly
[2:32:46] Killdozer77: I just cast in the canal right next to where you finish the retaking quests
[2:32:48] christabelle: Worgen get a free hearth there xD
[2:32:55] Killdozer77: i just had to fly there
[2:32:57] Sindorein1124: There is a toy
[2:33:00] GodfatherScooby: or use dragonriding and get there super quick
[2:33:02] lucynsol: I don't think they did, cause there's only the Bel'ameth portal. mamsSweat
[2:33:04] Blatsphemare: i flew from ironforge didnt take long
[2:33:14] 7thSaga: cant a mage port you to Gilneas?
[2:33:19] Terra___l: if you are an worgen you have the toy all others fly
[2:33:42] jlgodfrey: Woah you have hair?
[2:33:47] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[2:33:47] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:34:10] Kurama__95: I got 5 Flavor pockets this week, can't believe I had all those alts doing nothing instead of working to justify their existance savixKEKW
[2:34:20] anne42: I so suck at dragon racing. lol. best I can get is bronze
[2:34:33] Cooperharley0204: Any recommendations on a new player getting into WoW? Should  I just wait until the next expac or come in now?
[2:35:31] Hippwn: How about a worgen monk who used the power of mediation to calm the raging beast within! lol
[2:35:33] wolfcloudchaser80: @anne42 One thing that helps, anywhere that you can safely do so, use skyward ascent instead of surge. It's a net speed gain.
[2:35:40] Cooperharley0204: Is priest your favorite?
[2:36:00] christabelle: I wish I could like priest xD
[2:36:08] AnarchyMoose: lots of alts that are also holy priests LUL
[2:36:12] christabelle: It's one of the only classes I still can't make myself enjoy, of my stable of alts xD
[2:36:23] themaykr_: gnomes are anything but holy LUL
[2:36:31] Kurama__95: @Cooperharley0204 As someone who started on the last patch of BfA, the time before the next expansion is the best to get familiar with how the game works and not get too overwhelmed when it changes
[2:36:39] christabelle: I don't know if I'd recommend priest as a new player class though? Leveling it was like pulling teeth.
[2:37:13] themaykr_: why? you have shadow priest
[2:37:13] chimneybob: I tried playing wow a few times over the years, but ended up quitting when I couldn't find a nice guild to raid with pepesad
[2:37:14] WillWonkaa: Where is this event? Does it show on the world map or something?
[2:37:20] Ryok: jesus... eco dome race is terrible, not only is it very long no that bright pink absolutely hurts my eyes D:
[2:37:25] jlgodfrey: What is this? Event?
[2:37:30] Arabany: @Cooperharley0204 I'd say it depends on what your goal is. if it is to explore and enjoy the game, there is no point waiting. If it is the "endgame"-no point to wait either, gear resets every few months or so.
[2:38:02] Terra___l: i want an dryad
[2:38:07] themaykr_: the problem is I like and want every class
[2:38:14] cashthb: you could also do it irl, wasn't encouraged tho
[2:38:22] Terra___l: born out an nut is kinda sweet
[2:38:26] McScooterson: what's everyone's best dragon racing song?
[2:38:49] Kurama__95: I can't decide if I love or hate what they named the new public event savixKEKW
[2:38:55] witchhobbit: yessss you get it
[2:38:57] christabelle: @themaykr_ I have one of every class, and more than one of some, lol. Just takes time...
[2:39:53] witchhobbit: i've been going back and forth on pally and priest, j have no clue what i'm going to pick for war within
[2:40:03] dicemeister23: how long is dig into quest?
[2:40:08] dicemeister23: intro*
[2:40:14] Synkronos: Just don't hop off! Do other collecting for the other 50 minutes!
[2:40:16] christabelle: pally so STRONG now
[2:40:20] christabelle: ret is actually fun
[2:40:53] witchhobbit: i just, always need more mog
[2:40:53] Aseopp: what, last time i chekced pally was at the bottom of the dps rankings
[2:41:01] Aseopp: but always fun
[2:41:38] Aseopp: I leave for a week and all of a sudden my class is buffed XD
[2:42:07] christabelle: I just couldn't enjoy ret pally for a long time. I like holy in PvP, but the last update they got really made it just feel better over all. Got me tempted to try holy pally in PVE even, though the melee style healing is a bit intimidating.
[2:42:39] witchhobbit: i feel like i wanna choose a main that i can solo things on but just going on that, isn't that fun
[2:42:49] Aseopp: @christabelle how is ret in pvp?
[2:42:56] christabelle: Eh, Hunter is good for that AND fun
[2:43:07] SaraDivine: having a wormhole is the only saving grace for engineering this expansion. very nice for events like this
[2:43:12] christabelle: @Aseopp Haven't tried it! Only ever done holy as PvP, and even that's been a while.
[2:43:21] Vyragor9: Vyragor9 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:43:21] Streamlabs: vyragor9 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:43:21] Aseopp: @christabelle <3
[2:43:32] tehl00py: @saradivine the only reason i have engineering, truly
[2:43:39] Kurama__95: I haven't used Wormhole at all in DF, which is the opposite experience compared to SL LUL
[2:43:42] evosce: how did we all feel about WoW's first cinematic kiss? <3
[2:43:48] witchhobbit: starting engineering for wormholes is So tempting
[2:43:56] Arabany: @christabelle I love Holy paladin, but I wish he had better group healing.
[2:44:01] Aseopp: @christabelle <3
[2:44:13] christabelle: hunter is the ultimate "I can solo this" class...alongside paladin, probably. I just love hunters. So many aesthetics to go in on. Only downside is lots of ugly mail armor.
[2:44:27] christabelle: @Arabany that's always been what holds me back from it, but it looks like it's in a better place for that these days?
[2:44:43] christabelle: I've yet to try it, but follower dungeons may let me practice that without hurting a real group, lol
[2:44:45] themaykr_: seeing bow = neuron activation = dopamine
[2:45:21] InfiniFiasco: Did you get the rogue legion class hall mount?
[2:45:34] BoogiePonderosa: was that a portal mod?
[2:45:38] BoogiePonderosa: addon
[2:45:42] tehl00py: @evosce xD jealous of tyrande fr
[2:45:51] BoogiePonderosa: oh cool
[2:46:07] christabelle: @evosce I gasped a little!
[2:46:18] christabelle: It was so nice to see those two get a moment to themselves at last...
[2:46:28] Kurama__95: Dragonriding in the old world feels a bit liberating, ngl LUL
[2:46:30] dicemeister23: whats the point of Soridormi rep?
[2:46:55] dicemeister23: I can wowhead it lol
[2:47:03] Kurama__95: Title, transmog and achievement that will prob be included in the expansion meta one
[2:47:28] DoctorOgenki: but by the time you hit that rep level (like most rep levels) you have all the mounts/gear
[2:47:29] Espartico: no way we can dragon ride in the old world now!
[2:47:48] themaykr_: it looks updated or am I wrong
[2:47:51] Arabany: @christabelle It is better then before, but! it depends on the content you do. the kit is absolutely fine in every tier of raid and regular dungeons. Keys are tricky, if you are into, I don't. I hate keys and don't do them. the spec is also very heavy on abilities and cooldowns nowdays.
[2:47:53] christabelle: @Espartico yeah, this patch added a lot!
[2:47:54] Marmoh: I really hope Delves reignite outdoor content. I can't help but feel the systems we have now are not particularly engaging
[2:48:01] cashthb: well most of it sunk
[2:48:03] Hippwn: All the reclaiming Gilneas but what about the Goblin island lol :P
[2:48:04] Kurama__95: I wonder when Gilneas will become a fully fledged capital city like Bel'ameth is now
[2:48:08] dicemeister23: Rank 1: Starting rank. Rank 2:  Minute Glass Rank 3:  Ensemble: Rift-Mender's Vestments Rank 4:  Greater Encapsulated Destiny (free mount) Rank 5: Title, <Name> Unparalleled and  Greater Paracausal Chest
[2:48:14] Curufin_: raft
[2:48:17] vandraren: fishing raft
[2:48:21] Aseopp: raft?
[2:48:27] vandraren: oooh
[2:48:31] lucynsol: tuskarr?
[2:48:32] cashthb: dingy?
[2:48:34] eseltec: dingy
[2:48:35] kaijoe_: Dinghy?
[2:48:36] WowMittensMeow: Tuskarr
[2:48:49] vandraren: :D
[2:49:04] christabelle: @Arabany Yeah, I'm trying to get a LITTLE into keys at last, but really only on resto shaman. I have no desire for anything 20+, but I don't think I'd like holy pally in keys either, too risky for me. (Preservation evoker feels scary for those too, not a lot of quick heals?)
[2:49:21] cashthb: also it rains
[2:49:35] christabelle: @Hippwn technically it was reclaimed yeah, in Goblin heritage stuff?
[2:49:41] Aseopp: rain, fishing, looks perfect
[2:49:43] tehl00py: you said tackle box but i heard taco box <3
[2:49:44] Chamiunt: just got here what are you fishing for?
[2:49:48] Marmoh: There;s an addon that fishes for you?
[2:49:55] McScooterson: this raft eludes me.
[2:50:03] Chamiunt: ooo no way PogChamp
[2:50:06] christabelle: lord godfrey's old glasses
[2:50:10] christabelle: pr spectacles or something
[2:50:10] BoogiePonderosa: -2 on myopia?
[2:50:21] dicemeister23: Theory is you could always fish it up but nobody tried
[2:50:32] witchhobbit: i still can't figure out better fishing, it doesn't seem to work usually
[2:50:39] witchhobbit: got it to work once
[2:50:40] PyahPyahPyahSoda: Someone yesterday said you could pick up a toy out of a grave somewhere. was it ever said where?
[2:51:02] Calaxandra: @PyahPyahPyahSoda Only if you are a worgen
[2:51:17] christabelle: @PyahPyahPyahSoda part of the story
[2:51:22] PyahPyahPyahSoda: damn it lmao
[2:51:22] christabelle: you'll be taken to it at the end
[2:51:27] christabelle: it's worgen only
[2:51:27] jeffdmk: it is not in att yet i think they update tomorrow
[2:51:37] witchhobbit: yeah may just be my settings i have to fight
[2:51:39] christabelle: I think anyone can get it but only Worgen can use it, that is
[2:51:52] cashthb: some of the vendors had a few whites I didn't have yet
[2:51:54] witchhobbit: nope, i can use it on my gnome
[2:51:57] witchhobbit: its cosmetic
[2:52:00] cashthb: they are at the starting area
[2:52:05] Kurama__95: I'm waiting for ATT to update to see if I got all the transmog from the new Amirdrassil. I flew for like 30 mins looking for stuff LUL
[2:52:20] TheWyrdsmith: <3
[2:52:21] GreenArrowed: haven't heard this music in a while
[2:52:30] witchhobbit: oh sorry, the toy is worgen only. i thought we were talking about glasses sairaLUL
[2:52:33] christabelle: @PyahPyahPyahSoda it's a gilneas hearth for worgen, so...worth getting I guess if you have worgen who can use it
[2:52:48] MythicBlack520: did 140 cast last night and nothiung
[2:52:52] MythicBlack520: going back tonight
[2:53:00] Kurama__95: I'm gonna be honest, I like the new Night Elf city better than Teldrassil
[2:53:12] witchhobbit: @Kurama__95 my ATT showed it....
[2:53:13] VotableAntiFox: Hope you are staying warm.
[2:53:22] Arabany: @christabelle Holy Paladin is probably the most powerful healer to push high level keys, but it requires good team work and experience, imo. Does not work very well in pugs. But then again, keys are a game inside a game with its own rules.
[2:53:27] lucynsol: Where Amirdrassil is, the Dragon Isles.
[2:53:30] Kurama__95: It's in the Azeroth version of Amirdrassil
[2:53:31] christabelle: open up your map and you'll see it near Ohnaran plains
[2:53:34] HolocronCoder: You go to the emerald dream zone but not through the portal
[2:53:34] kikisume: I did about 170 casts before I got the glasses
[2:53:38] christabelle: way out west off the coast
[2:53:39] cashthb: yeah it's amidrassil, just don't go to the emberald dream portal
[2:54:04] cashthb: there's als a port in sw on the 2nd floor of the tower - after you did the quests atleast
[2:54:06] themaykr_: Sylvanas is twitching for another burned tree
[2:54:19] erinnightz: yes it is in the Dragon Isles it called Bel'ameth on the map
[2:54:20] indithedog: LOL
[2:54:20] Aseopp: Hey Hazel or chat, do you know an easy way to find high or med  population serves on PST time?
[2:54:27] kikisume: theres a portal for it in stormwind. in the new area they added in the tower
[2:54:37] Calaxandra: I'm seeing a picture on Twitter of a bunch of people fishing in the canal inside Gilneas
[2:54:41] ghostie1995: yeah cold weather makes my hands stiff
[2:54:44] Aseopp: without looking at each one individually
[2:54:51] BoogiePonderosa: i had to get one of those oil filled portable radiators to work from home in winter..
[2:54:56] tehl00py: @aseopp come on over to Proudmoore :3
[2:55:01] christabelle: @Arabany Yeah, and I don't have a guild/group of friends, it's a bit risky to pug with for me. Plus I just kinda prefer healers with a little bit of EVERYTHING....and resto shaman scratches that itch for me. HoTs, direct heals, AOE heals. Totems for lots of issues. The best interrupt in the game...lol. Holy pally is neat, but I don't think I'd play it seriously in much.
[2:55:09] Kurama__95: wowprogress(dot)com has that data
[2:55:20] witchhobbit: you could use the emerald dream portal and then fly out to the bough portal and back over the portal in the plains
[2:55:20] Aseopp: Oh yea, I have been on proudmoore before
[2:55:24] Ryok: hey anyone know how i actually turn on the random drake customizations once i learned the manuscript? D:
[2:55:36] witchhobbit: because theyre like, layered in a way
[2:55:39] christabelle: @Calaxandra there's no real designated spot - people claimed there was on day 1 but it's anywhere in Gilneas according to Wowhead comments
[2:55:47] Aseopp: @tehl00py I may just take you up on that invitiation :)
[2:55:58] cashthb: it put a spell on my bars after I used the glyph
[2:56:07] vildusten: i think it might be character specific
[2:56:08] Calaxandra: @christabelle Thanks!
[2:56:09] cashthb: so prolly in the spellbook if your bars were full
[2:56:12] Selyane: You can turn it on in your spell book, in general, in dragon riding
[2:56:31] tehl00py: @aseopp is an og server, ally side is friendly! a lot of casuals and some mid/hardcore guilds. tho trade chat is always trade chat :p
[2:56:33] witchhobbit: it is white yeah
[2:56:34] kikisume: white/gray
[2:56:44] christabelle: @Calaxandra Yeah, people were also trolling in general chat on night one, confusing people new to the zone. >_<
[2:56:45] Ryok: @cashthb that was it thanks xD i had space on my bars but of course i didn't look for it there
[2:56:55] Aseopp: @tehl00py is Manapaws still around?
[2:57:06] Arabany: @christabelle I have actually always wanted to try a shaman, but I love heavy armour and melee style.
[2:57:41] tehl00py: @aseopp is a guild? i haven‚Äôt seen em :<
[2:58:11] tehl00py: @arabany mail armor is heavy enough (lol) and enhance is fun!!
[2:58:20] Aseopp: @tehl00py It was a long time ago
[2:58:37] christabelle: @Arabany Enhancement is in the best place it's ever been! and it's FUN
[2:59:11] christabelle: Though I never liked the look of most plate, and mail isn't much better. But at least there's more mogs now that can look like different armor weights on any class.
[2:59:13] witchhobbit: just can't wait for the roll out of account wide things, going to be so nice to look at
[2:59:16] Arabany: but it is not a healer, I only play healers:)
[2:59:38] tehl00py: and shaman s3 shoulders are killer this exp :3
[2:59:53] indithedog: Nice!
[2:59:56] Hippwn: What is your favorite coloration of the current priest tier?
[2:59:59] witchhobbit: the chain mail tabards are so fun, everyone can get some chainmail :^)
[3:00:00] GodfatherScooby: Is it just me or is everyone missing a item from the dragon riding tree towards the top?
[3:00:01] christabelle: @Arabany Ah, well. Resto has always been my favorite healer of all. Has a toolkit for everything! Not melee, but being melee puts you in more danger of attacks and AOE stuff anyways, lol
[3:00:11] Kurama__95: EZ
[3:00:11] indithedog: EZ
[3:00:16] evosce: EZ
[3:00:20] chefdejour82: thats clean
[3:00:24] witchhobbit: i had to make a whole set based around those glasses when i got them lol
[3:00:31] christabelle: yeah that shirt is SO good
[3:00:39] McScooterson: that was practically negative casts. a++ rng
[3:00:42] witchhobbit: the top is so good
[3:00:44] christabelle: excited to get more colors of it
[3:01:16] Aseopp: Byeee
[3:01:19] Neltalie: thanks for the stream :D
[3:01:19] Diminted: Bye Hazel
[3:01:20] christabelle: Be well, Hazel! (And everyone else give shaman a shot!)
[3:01:21] tehl00py: hazelFlex hazelWave
[3:01:22] indithedog: preace
[3:01:24] Littlerocker212: bye
