[4:04:45] kaahl1: Asmongold proved it does work?
[4:04:45] deanoxs: but the system is there
[4:04:49] Expensivehamz: no they dont even read appeals, they just copy paste some template and move on to the next ticket and cite they "reviewed all evidence" lmao
[4:04:52] sadgemonke256: WHAT

[4:10:57] kaahl1: Yes, Asmongold got banned for massreport was fake

[4:11:32] guztawo: it doesnt make any sense, but it does happen
[4:11:33] struci: automatic system does not have to be based on number of reports

[4:11:47] jallaballan: it doesnt work on streamers, you get so many reports that they whitelisted your account from reports
[4:11:48] noctu_ary: as of a permaban, or temporary ? @PsheroTV
[4:12:10] struci: missing the point
[4:12:10] LillaJeon: If it was all based on numbers of reports (which I doubt it is) surely there would be some RP guilds being cleaners of Azeroth who'd run around and ban thousands of bots per day

[4:12:13] bobo5314: this discussion will never end. there is a automatic report system bro!
[4:12:16] xBONGLORDx: i believe its only a couple people on the ban system and they just fly through the requests
[4:12:29] mrSkard: payo deserved it
[4:12:29] struci: it could be auto-flagging based on behaviour with manual review — even without any reports
[4:12:32] struci: is that automated?
[4:12:34] guztawo: @PsheroTV to be fair, if ur that unlucky to get falsely banned, u will prob get ur acc unbanned cuz blizz know u 100% ur a streamer

[4:14:07] guztawo: tbh.. i prob wouldnt believe it either if it didnt happen to me
[4:14:07] VG_Ares: Ppl hate logic though
[4:14:07] Expensivehamz: idc what anyone says, blizz laid off their whole CS dept. no one is reviewing shit and if they are, they are incompetent because people getting banned for no reason and all appeals denied
[4:14:29] struci: I reckon there's a hybrid. Auto-Flagging based on behaviour (like moving too fast through the world, clipping through objects, sending lots of gold to random people) and then manual review
[4:14:33] bobo5314: Pshero sorry u don’t think right. there is a automatic report systems because many guys got banned incl me……. an I se d you proof?

[4:15:06] salibazap: @struci That's it, first you flagged then you get reviewed.
[4:15:12] beardbrogaming92: They had to dis able SoD gold swaps in the wow swap discord bc people were getting banned by GDKP detection, so i do believe they have automated systems in place.
[4:15:25] Expensivehamz: a GM TOLD ME, i got banned cause "My fellow players reported me for cheating" actually
[4:15:26] xBONGLORDx: Every ban i got was deserved because they showed proof dareKEK
[4:15:28] struci: you are trying to proof a negative ps
[4:15:29] guztawo: actually i got told i got reported by fellow players. reason: cheating/botting
[4:15:36] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety
[4:15:42] nqmatakav: trust me broski
[4:15:43] struci: your point: "there is no automatic system because I don't see one"
[4:15:45] xaaaaa: You dont get banned for mass reporting your account gets locked until somenone reviews it
[4:15:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: it ain't what ya know it's what you can prove!! nadedNerd
[4:15:49] guztawo: and i dont even know how to cheat, let alone done it
[4:15:55] Yormanqt: @struci this ^^
[4:15:57] noctu_ary: Banned for what mostly is the real question here @PsheroTV not by who
[4:16:04] salibazap: People that claim they got banned out of nowhere, they could be flagged for some time. And when reviewed they get banned, even if they were not doing anything at that time.
[4:16:09] Kartonplein: If Blizzard said so :)
[4:16:13] carnnezz: not yet. soon support will be chatgpt
[4:16:14] MKDarker: there is no radioactivity because i dont see it
[4:16:18] MKDarker: Kappa
[4:16:21] beardbrogaming92: amazon said there wasnt an automatic ban system either while thousands of players got banned by mass reports :p
[4:16:21] guztawo: @xaaaaa and u kknow that cuz u got banned or what?
[4:16:26] struci: I reckon there's a hybrid. Auto-Flagging based on behaviour and then manual review
[4:16:30] moonweaverx: ya and the gov doesnt control everything either
[4:16:30] Yormanqt: if blizzard say its true, trustable company
[4:16:30] Kartonplein: To hide that they're shit ppl
[4:16:31] struci: that's automation but without auto-bans
[4:16:33] bobo5314: Pshero sorry u don’t think right. there is a automatic report systems because many guys got banned incl me……. an I send you proof?

[4:17:31] bobo5314: xaaaaa u right
[4:17:35] carnnezz: there are auto flags its been tested
[4:17:36] Expensivehamz: they dont review anything... they ban based on no evidence, then cite they reviewed all evidence when u appeal.
[4:17:36] StreamElements: Check out my Merch here! -> https://merch.streamelements.com/psherotv
[4:17:36] Grehdeh: Could you see those workers not giving a fuck and clicking through and banning the reports?
[4:17:39] mrSkard: at this point bobo is trolling guys
[4:17:55] salibazap: The only thing is you can get Muted automatically
[4:17:58] beardbrogaming92: Humans? at blizzard? they are a small indie company bro
[4:18:00] LillaJeon: If x amount of reports are a bullet proof ban system. Then... aren't the bots kinda our fault? We could just all get together and remove all bots from the game in a day. So why do we blame Blizzard? Hmmm
[4:18:07] guztawo: the bots mass reports u when u farm them, seems like only a very small amount of those actually get banned tho
[4:18:08] struci: YEP the intern sees the thousands of flagged accounts and just clicks: "Select all" and clicks "3 day ban"
[4:18:14] jallaballan: Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions
[4:18:15] SrsBalnazzar: never heard of anyone getting banned for no reason
[4:18:22] jallaballan: "determined by other players reports"
[4:18:34] Expensivehamz: @SrsBalnazzar literally google it
[4:18:34] Kartonplein: Guys it's not automatic if a guy has to click "ACCEPT" to ban 10k accounts
[4:18:40] Istunlocklocalpensioners: don't detract from people's enjoyment!! nadedDerp
[4:18:43] guztawo: @SrsBalnazzar well ur about to
[4:18:44] SrsBalnazzar: from my experience i dont follow tiktok
[4:18:46] bobo5314: Pshero sorry u don’t think right. there is a automatic report systems because many guys got banned incl me……. an I se d you proof?
[4:19:03] struci: @jallaballan AND… not or
[4:19:10] SrsBalnazzar: and i dont believe you guys, probably a bunch of liars
[4:19:21] LillaJeon: All I'm saying is... USUALLY when people say they got banned for nothing, they are leaving out crucial elements that could very well be bannable
[4:19:25] struci: the "AND Blizzard's decision" is important here
[4:19:31] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Wait but if I mutilate envenom someone, and corpse camp their account, and it detracts from their enjoyment somewhat, is that bad?
[4:19:40] zoomers0MEGALUL: tell em ps
[4:19:43] beardbrogaming92: @SrsBalnazzar they have an automated ban system for GDKP detection on SoD. The gold swap discord had to disable swaps bc tons of people got hit by it for swapping gold.
[4:19:57] guztawo: WHY would i sit here and waste my time if i DID cheat? i got my acc back and everything its not like im a fcking botter psycho that wanna defend all cheaters and support botting
[4:20:03] salibazap: Any Suspension or Ban takes a blizzard employee, there's no autoban in place. You guys tripping. At max you can get muted/silenced automatically.
[4:20:04] struci: YEP probably auto-flagging and manual ban
[4:20:06] StreamElements: Check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel! -> https://www.youtube.com/psheor
[4:20:12] Kartonplein: Yeah a guy click accept for 1000 acc it's so different from automatic
[4:20:23] exeggutorx: Mahlzeit PS
[4:20:39] struci: you might've been falsely auto-flagged and then banned — but that was probably just falling through the cracks

[4:21:10] MKDarker: there are really people behind it deciding stuff. I talked with someone about a 7 days muted via ticket and it felt genuinely there was someone behind it
[4:21:12] bobo5314: guztawo don’t give him the right bro
[4:21:17] Slickk34: can you repeat the last 10 minutes, i was busy getting auto banned

[4:22:10] bobo5314: well I have my proof..

[4:22:18] Vinmannen: damn is this the AB soundtrack?
[4:22:31] struci: but in that case… if you just trust the auto-flag… how is that not an automated ban?
[4:22:32] NsaneTrav561: having someone receive a list of accounts to ban and clicking a button without reviewing is pretty much an auto action lol
[4:22:50] struci: that just sounds like an autoban with extra steps to me at that point KEKW
[4:22:54] SAMO0RA1: yes and now with the layoffs i dont think they check every single one of them
[4:22:55] salibazap: People do shady shit in the game for years, then because at the moment they were banned they were doing just casual stuff, they go like: no way i was banned, must have been the bots.
[4:22:58] VG_Ares: @bobo5314 Mentally ill ppl also want us to believe their reality, it doesn't make it real
[4:23:00] terpvision420: I got over 40 people in my guild to report a bot fisher and he was out there for 3 more days

[4:25:43] bobo5314: yeah…
[4:25:43] zathorius: yeah cuz hes manually watching all his automatic bots LuL
[4:25:46] Shocktherapy1: So few years back i was working as a GM for an online MMO and all i want to say is that every MMO game has almost the same Ban/Ticket system and ban system overview. To put things in perspective, you as a GM overview tickets and reports from players then you gather all the information submitted by the players. Afterwards, a team of GM's gather a meeting where they decide the action against the account.
[4:25:57] SrsBalnazzar: it's very likely the cartel put a hit on you
[4:25:57] LillaJeon: Someone is killing 1 bot out of the hundreds of bots he has running. I doubt he'd bother banning that guy

[4:26:40] hemsho: sure brother

[4:26:48] hemsho: KEKW
[4:26:51] bobo5314: u right Pshero..
[4:26:54] FreddiFish07: @salibazap a boar?
[4:26:55] Danggus: ahh yes, the ol auto system described perfectly
[4:26:59] ev3rlasting4: Guys, we've incorporated an AI solution to generate documentation for our products. Even though the content is generated by the bot, we ( the ppl) have the last say how or if it will go live. It makes no sense to have an actual auto-ban system, cause that would get them in trouble...
[4:27:01] Kartonplein: sure a team of wow gm's review each ban

[4:33:59] carrioncorps: id say the most likely thing would be that in the report descriptions, someone or a group of people may have written a convincin report, blizzard take a very dim view of manipulating bans in that way, which i assume means they do make mistakes when banning

[4:46:37] struci: just because the REASON he got flagged is mass reports, doesn't proof the bans are automatic wtf guys
[4:46:41] frogwallet: @frogwallet This guy has literally said he farmed them for an extended period of time

[4:47:20] sebastian_x69: i worked at blizzard for 25 years and there is no auto ban system @PsheroTV
[4:47:24] Spruehfurz88: no proof, it would make sense to remove bad actors quickly from the game and having it reviewed after by staff
[4:47:31] cxar2202: it is automated
[4:47:32] guztawo: @daodjinn yes i did 30 appeals or some shit, they told me i got banned by fellow players for cheating/botting/exploiting game mech
[4:47:32] struci: if it was fully automated, why would the banning happen in waves? KEKW

[4:47:56] Kartonplein: @struci automated when MASS reported, the bot aren't mass reported

[4:48:13] struci: Clueless
[4:48:15] PLAYERGODUNKNOWN: Gandalf lmfao
[4:48:17] Spruehfurz88: they review the auto bans

[4:48:18] 0_exclamation: brother u aint taking stables
[4:48:19] frogwallet: @guztawo I'd wager you were actually reported by other players. If you were farming the bots, constantly, players that were reporting the bots, probably reported YOU also

[4:48:23] djzou: @PsheroTV brother did you get anything from gnome?
[4:48:24] jallaballan: but explain this, if noone works at blizzard, and people are getting banned, who is doing the bans?
[4:48:30] guztawo: @daodjinn it could
[4:48:31] cripples42069: so you saying, when people mass report someone. it pings a real human. that then bans the person
[4:48:31] gusbillat: @Kartonplein exactly! however automatic ban exist even though its shit
[4:48:39] mistahfrank: i got auto banned. message said "you have been auto banned". trust me bro

[4:49:16] Aingaingg: I'm pretty sure there was a streamer who tested if mass report works by getting his viewers report him, and he got suspended
[4:49:18] daodjinn: @guztawo example of an addon that at least on retail is bannabe is the one "shobek" (if u knwo who shobek is) to change the look of he s char in game

[4:50:37] daodjinn: @PsheroTV they have done autoban on retail in the past and it backfired so hard with team reporting u in rbg to get free wins so they stoped it
[4:50:42] Insane_mi: Insane_mi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:50:56] Ukih: I reported a guy pretending to be GM, 3 days have passed and he ins't still banned
[4:51:06] oilyblackmouth: how do we know which company they subcontract to deal with GM responsibilities?
[4:51:26] bashtavik: what is that gear 2700 life
[4:51:34] struci: KEKW then he proceeds to just hang out the roof all day
[4:51:35] NsaneTrav561: question how do you know their process ? what facts are out there stating that their is no automated feature taking these flagged accounts and banning them. Dont you think its easy to auto ban and work the cases that have appeals.. It would weed out the bots
[4:51:35] jallaballan: the bans happen to fast to not be automated, while it takes over a week to get response on a simple ticket, they dont have enough people to sort through the reports and manually ban
[4:51:48] frogwallet: @struci god that clip hurts so bad. I've had people on project teams that we've done this to. They were so damn destructive we paid them to do nothing, instead of fucking up the codebase
[4:51:51] struci: KEKW he ends up hanging out on the roof for 3 years, being paid for nothing

[5:09:51] LillaJeon: @minich4rmander That's my point. People seem to think it's easy, but it's really not. Streaming is one of those jobs were 99% fails

[7:12:18] gratzitko: u cant use meta and chaos bolt
[7:12:22] gratzitko: and if ur not in meta, ur getting 2 shot
[7:12:54] gratzitko: ur a mage without blink, or mana shield, or ice block, if ur trying to be a chaos bolt casting warlock lol
[7:13:06] CasualNerdingTV: dont u have instant chaos bolt or sth

[7:13:21] faz_aplay: @zickiwow do it pussy
[7:13:42] gratzitko: @chebupel78 na u dont get 2 shot as meta lock, not by melee atleast, so gives u some survivability
[7:13:54] zickiwow: i even 2shot some warris
[7:13:56] Tobone: does it makes sense to play crippling with waylay rune? does it stacks?

[7:14:28] zickiwow: how do u feel about woundp? too weak?
[7:14:39] gratzitko: yes but theres a difference imo, rogues have vanish/evasion mages have blink/block ETC. destro lock without meta is just a 1500 hp clothie with long cast times and no shields or defensiveslol. just not rly viable IMO
[7:14:41] Tobone: thanks :D
[7:15:02] gratzitko: thats why they all play meta lol

[7:16:03] gratzitko: it was worth at 25, but at 40 not even close to worth the absorb
