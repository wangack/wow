[0:36:14] Aegatron: LULW
[0:36:17] sim967: that wouldn't be any cheaper
[0:36:28] Deckx: trust me, I have a profi built studio in my house. soundproofing is very expensive and not that easy

[0:37:23] mika01: buy them headphones... LUL

[0:38:57] bambooooh: they have show rooms etc. all over EU i believe, also here in denmark, we got a single box for 1 person with a laptop for remote meetings etc.
[0:39:09] bambooooh: our sales people love it since they also work in an open space office
[0:39:18] bambooooh: you can't hear them and they can't hear you at all
[0:39:24] musiclstherapy: goddamn that hoodie is lit!
[0:39:27] bambooooh: i believe they also do online showcasing
[0:39:50] DerpOwling: I have that exact quattro in the office that won't fit your streaming set-up it will barely fit your chair.
[0:40:00] bambooooh: they also do custom work
[0:40:09] Aegatron: ye looks like you barely can turn around in there

[0:40:54] formation2252: Googling how to cheaply sound proof a room give a list of things to do.
[0:40:59] BigBjornYerthor: When I looked at those a while back, the big one was like 9k USD
[0:41:11] bambooooh: their boxes are fully modular, you just need to reach out to them @Naguura

[0:41:39] Aegatron: Drake my streamer
[0:41:40] formation2252: You would have to put up some railings or whatever but can't see how that is worse than buying a room to do it.
[0:41:48] TotallyNotRaien: "hey company gib free product"
[0:42:05] bambooooh: lemme promote you for a free box Kappa
[0:42:07] Aegatron: ye let them make you a prototype
[0:42:22] formation2252: I expect most streamers wouldn't be able to afford it.
[0:42:57] bambooooh: they can be rather expensive depending on where people live and the currency conversion
[0:43:08] TotallyNotRaien: roomless
[0:43:08] uncivil82: naguura have you ever considered streaming on another platform like youtube or even been approached ?
[0:43:15] bambooooh: here in Denmark it's someone mildly expensive but nothing too much
[0:43:21] Kuroz: she's multistreaming on youtube

[0:44:12] uncivil82: i just have a hard time navigating youtube and finding the live section for live streaming
[0:44:20] TotallyNotRaien: do it assert dominance
[0:44:22] sergenda: Why not Kappa just do it, whos gonna stop you?
[0:44:26] IamSpellbound: are you allowed to put up a booth in a shared office space?
[0:44:36] formation2252: haha, not a room pre se. I know that. Sorry trying to explain in short messages is hard to do.
[0:44:47] chutabulla: heya, what u eating?

[0:47:07] mirso_07: Dont forget that 3pm ( USA time ) = 23 PM Europe time
[0:47:15] krinuk: are these hero talents a bonus to the normal talents ?

[0:49:53] TotallyNotRaien: isnt astral damage the one that does both?
[0:49:57] TotallyNotRaien: why not that astral
[0:50:41] TotallyNotRaien: as i see
[0:50:52] Dagomarus: i prefer the lasers one thats gonna be shared between balance and guardian laser bear is gonna be fun
[0:51:33] Arwya0203: fraggyHI fraggyHI

[0:58:29] Sebleh: gm naguuraSip
[0:59:48] miDnight_SC2: @Naguura wouldn't that make fitting all moons into boat window easier without overcapping =
[0:59:50] sim967: resto have astral power?
[1:00:26] miDnight_SC2: leads into pooling and dumping doesnt it
[1:01:44] miDnight_SC2: well ebb and flow  .. its the Moon theme idea.. Class fantasy and all
[1:02:57] devascienos: wlecome to ele but its not a talent thing its just the design of the class
[1:03:49] miDnight_SC2: yeah
[1:04:04] vikutoru11: Good morning naguuraClap
[1:04:18] Kuroz: CatDriving @vikutoru11
[1:04:47] miDnight_SC2: And THEN you get the mechanic to run out and tank your dmg..
[1:05:24] TotallyNotRaien: if you dont use it when its off cd
[1:05:32] Sebleh: it’s a refund for holding the cd
[1:05:51] miDnight_SC2: @Naguura yeah if you hold your CDs the cd gets shorter after using it
[1:05:55] Sebleh: if you hold CA for 5 seconds the CD is 2:55 instead of 3 minutes
[1:06:01] miDnight_SC2: ^
[1:06:17] Sebleh: 5s is nothing
[1:06:23] Sebleh: but it’s more for convoke and the other spells in there
[1:06:33] Sebleh: CA gets the shittiest one so we’re never gonna use that
[1:06:35] TotallyNotRaien: should scale with cd length
[1:06:45] CorwenTTV: will make it a bit awkward to macro a 3 min trinket with it
[1:06:48] Sebleh: well tres and convoke too
[1:07:39] Zirox88: wie hast du so gut englisch gelernt?
[1:07:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:07:58] Sebleh: well no because you can hold it so you’re still having convoke available every 1 minute
[1:08:02] chutabulla: do u feel like a hero with these talents lol
[1:08:05] Sebleh: but yes trinkets get fucked
[1:08:19] TotallyNotRaien: doesnt it seem like a net zero gain talent?
[1:08:33] Sebleh: yeah nvm
[1:08:34] Sebleh: I see
[1:08:47] Sebleh: flourish gets pushed even if convoke doesnt
[1:08:51] Sebleh: so that’s dumb
[1:09:15] iRenevan: what new hero tanlents bring to a moonkin ? replace WoE into trants thats all
[1:09:23] Sebleh: you like having the regrowth cast into bear form into frenzied for one defensive?
[1:09:42] Drvvn: how long does regrowth last?
[1:10:10] TotallyNotRaien: 10s
[1:10:38] iRenevan: now u have choice casting 1.5s regrowth or spend double gcp for beer form
[1:11:04] Arverange: obviously its for restoration and not balance
[1:11:08] miDnight_SC2: Beer form? Dwarfen druid confirmed? :D
[1:11:12] Sebleh: no it’s for both @arverange
[1:11:14] StreamElements: Start learning a new language in 3 weeks with Babbel! Use my link https://bit.ly/3U7Nwcq to get up to 60% OFF a lifetime subscription!
[1:11:20] Fleymour: sounds good for pvp
[1:11:22] Sebleh: you will almost always have that up because we do a lot of spenders anyway
[1:11:50] Sebleh: depending on the proc duration we could just have a instant regrowth almost always available.
[1:11:53] Arverange: @Sebleh the "5 Regrowth for 100% Starsrurge" is design to use as restoration not balance
[1:12:04] darksource1987: Ill just lvl to 80 SeemsGood
[1:12:35] Sebleh: @arverange we’re not concerned about the resto portions of the tree tho
[1:12:46] iRenevan: trees better then woe finally
[1:12:58] DerLadebalken: Power of Dreams?
[1:13:03] miDnight_SC2: The most annoying bit on this tree is that you need to take trees for it to count .. like it'sn ot even baseline
[1:13:09] miDnight_SC2: not for moonkin neither for resto
[1:13:10] athemick: didn't they said we will have all talents in hero tree? and we will just take pick from choice nodes, but will have everything else in tree
[1:13:11] Sebleh: @midnight_sc2 yeh
[1:13:20] Sebleh: @athemick yes
[1:13:22] TotallyNotRaien: arverange the bottom option is the balance in that one
[1:13:44] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[1:13:57] lulukitty: do you only get to choose one of the 3 paths?
[1:14:20] Sebleh: my question is if trees cast their own moon fires or just yours and if they interact with twin moons. also if the 6s cd is per tree or for the set of trees.
[1:14:30] Sebleh: could be you just don’t have to ramp anymore but I doubt it
[1:14:35] Arverange: i mean since you get both doesnt that meen that every 5 deffensice used regrowths will give the 100% dmg increase anyways? its not much but its somthing or not?
[1:14:37] BigD530: @lulukitty you'll eventually get ALL of it
[1:14:46] miDnight_SC2: well itss .. a hero TREE after all Kappa
[1:14:58] iRenevan: u can pick guardian hero talents then
[1:15:14] miDnight_SC2: have we seen what Chosen of Elune talents are yet ?
[1:15:28] uhhhhyeayoo: bong
[1:15:30] Sebleh: @arverange you’re not gonna cast 5 regrowth unless you’re literally sitting for like 10s with no target
[1:15:48] Sebleh: @midnight_sc2 only the blizzcon preview
[1:15:49] TotallyNotRaien: nono naguura that will be gamebreaking dont you get it?
[1:16:07] Arverange: @Sebleh does it reset after a fight ends? if not it could see some value in M+
[1:16:25] Sebleh: @arverange it most likely with have a short duration like 10-15s
[1:16:31] Sebleh: but nobody knows yet
[1:17:29] Sebleh: yeah that’s like half an eclipse to stack it and it’s hardly worth it
[1:17:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:17:46] TotallyNotRaien: but that next wrath will absolutely one shot the whole pack
[1:17:50] Sebleh: you can literally only do it during intermissions or rp
[1:17:53] iRenevan: 5 regrowth as prepull
[1:18:04] halfwaythug: i can see this happening in arena when yopu run behind a pillar and top yourself with regrowths
[1:18:13] TotallyNotRaien: lmao pvp
[1:18:27] wicked_baboon: 5 regrowth as prepull to rip aggro from tank on pull and die xD
[1:19:23] Arverange: how tf would you pull aggro with a regrowth tick on pull
[1:19:37] Sebleh: they’re also gonna run out of mana really fast and realize they can do it once every 5 minutes
[1:19:37] Aegatron: Priest is a aug now nice
[1:19:57] wicked_baboon: @Arverange not with regrowth tick, but with wrath dmg :)
[1:20:25] Sebleh: Main main question on these is if the trees cast their own moon fires or just yours and if they interact with twin moons since it could reduce ramp time. also if the 6s cd is per tree or for the set of trees.
[1:20:29] Arverange: @wicked_baboon maybe if the tank was afk and you are the only one casting :D
[1:20:33] Sebleh: it’s like the only thing that could save it IMO
[1:20:43] astronomiculeu: Elune seems to be the one we will go for
[1:20:52] astronomiculeu: I’d prefer to follow Elune as well.
[1:21:07] miDnight_SC2: I don't mind treants but thats from a resto perspective in keys- But  they gonna force them into the Keeper of the Grove talents as it was the main feature for the Keeper fo the Grove Hero in WC3
[1:21:16] Sebleh: @arverange some abilities don’t do threat when used outside of combat like dh fire sigils
[1:21:22] lulukitty: idk why they dont just commit to making incarn a 2min cd
[1:21:37] TotallyNotRaien: what an underwhelming hero talent
[1:21:50] Sebleh: yeah @totallynotraien
[1:21:54] TotallyNotRaien: im hoping the resto feral talents are more interesting
[1:22:16] Arverange: @Sebleh i have never seen a dh pull with sigil outside of combat without mixing it with glavethrow or his jump tbh
[1:22:18] Sebleh: they could literally moonfire 6 targets that’s a normal M+ pack
[1:22:27] falldrgn: I think people also need to understand this will probably be re worked\ several times till release.
[1:22:55] Sebleh: true
[1:23:19] TotallyNotRaien: @falldrgn this are the exact same from blizzcon, typos and all
[1:23:20] Sebleh: it sounds like using convoke for moonfire spam in shadowlands
[1:23:29] Faraday5001: trees dont fit into the tree, ironic
[1:23:32] Sebleh: which is possible but not the best use

[1:27:16] Purrfektly: the DR sounds really good

[1:28:47] Thoreya: its good for mm i feel like
[1:29:27] Arverange: i heared its very good for bm since its smoothes out the rng of bm by giving more barb shots
[1:29:34] Arverange: i dont play hunter so idk

[1:31:25] Garandiel: she doesnt know
[1:31:28] halfwaythug: it's 1 minute instead of 2
[1:31:32] Arverange: read the rest of the tree, its very much better then pi
[1:31:44] T0GART: copying astrologian from FF14
[1:31:45] jarilrpg: It rotates which buff you give, you don't get all
[1:31:50] halfwaythug: but the whole tree is turning priest into some kind of support class
[1:31:51] calmuz96: imo I think they should jsut make pi a BL/Hero effect or just make it a party wide buff with a 2 min exhaustion effect to stop people stacking priests

[1:39:07] Kvaigondjin: I think u can reduce cd of that ulti instead of 12% haste. Can explain. Imagine long fight and reading last talent. So if u use it twice more time or maybe 3 u can buff extra more ppl with prok. Its 16% cd reduction right? Isnt so bad with numbers

[1:50:20] vikutoru11: Remember season 1 of DF where the classes were pretty balanced naguuraFBM
[1:50:29] y0rge: blizzard cant balance class for ages now and you want they to balance  skills like pi :)
[1:50:35] Teraision: so let me get this right, all they did with this tree is to remove PI and then add it back in divided into multiple talents?

[2:20:47] Elembry_us: Thank god it was nerfed half way through the season. Tempest sucked
[2:20:49] Sebleh: nokhud was fine tbh except for the mandatory trash
[2:20:51] MBG_95: @sebleh all they said was they will revisit DF dungeons, doesn't reference dawn at all, to me that includes Dawn
[2:20:56] VipMalis: didn't like neltharus and in halls of infusion ranged died to everything
[2:21:01] Sebleh: @mbg_95 no they said base 8 dungeons
[2:21:05] GooseComics: Mod me @Naguura I'll ban the ToP dude
[2:21:06] Sebleh: please watch the blizzcon interviews
[2:21:07] yfar30: Buenos días desde Colombia @naguura
[2:21:08] halfwaythug: spires or halls of atonement if it's SL dungeons plz
[2:21:17] Elembry_us: Halls has the worst respawn
[2:21:20] helicroft: de other side was horrible holyyyyyy
[2:21:21] BosakMaw: only bad was sanguine depths, everything else was super good
[2:21:26] Moai: cant wait for ruby and algethar
[2:21:26] Sebleh: I’ve been saying this since fucking November how do people still not know it’s the base 8 dungeons?
[2:21:31] JohnAllenCasts: My least favourite thing about NO was that as a devoker we'd often get a bug where if we released, we'd be stuck in combat and then just... couldn't get back to the pull until it was over. If the tank chain pulled? you'd still be stuck. so ass
[2:21:35] halfwaythug: but those were the 'best' 2 :D
[2:21:47] AceReformed: Funnily enough, BFA had the best dungeon design, legion had the best mob design YEP
[2:21:50] Zardon_94: hey stop insulting my fav dungeons
[2:21:53] GooseComics: the best 2 dungeons in SLands was Taz Streets and Taz Gambit
[2:21:55] thundork: @AceReformed idk tbh i feel rise is easier for me to pug tbh
[2:21:56] GooseComics: Nothing else
[2:21:59] m0dify: mists minigame yikes
[2:22:04] TotallyNotRaien: the maze was great
[2:22:06] silverback1977: the only thing i "hated" about sl dungeons was the neccessity to bring special covenants
[2:22:09] dr__mantis_toboggan_md: I dunno, I have like a weird fondness for shadowlands dungeons but I also wasnt pushing max key level to see some of the weirdness
[2:22:12] thundork: halls of atonement was fun Okayge
[2:22:13] fizzleblast127: Can someone link the blue post stating the season 4 dungeons? Can't find it
[2:22:15] Sebleh: and then they fixed that YEP
[2:22:22] GooseComics: @fizzleblast127 because there isn't one

[2:38:23] rawrr009: @GrimWizard i never take augs they always deplete my keys, you never know what aug is good or not  xD
[2:38:43] Sebleh: Naguura why don't you play Manifested Timeways closer to melee so you have to run less between zones?
[2:38:51] GrimWizard: @GrimWizard true i only trust myself haha, i feel people who played pres and aug will be great at aug
[2:39:18] MooniexVibes: my pres was an Aug for a while, got to about 2.8k and then was like…. Aug is boring if the group isn’t good
[2:39:22] GrimWizard: but aug has always made keys feel like 2levels easier from my experiences

[2:42:44] heronymusbots: idle hands... lead you back to wow ha
[2:42:47] Sebleh: I thought about trying out SoD, but at the end of the day it still plays like Classic, and that's a big no for me.
[2:43:07] MooniexVibes: I really hope the “chosen of Elune” abilities are better than the keeper of the grove abilities for the hero ones coming out next expac 😅 last thing I want is to have to regrowth as part of my rotation

[2:43:58] Aegatron: phase 2?
[2:44:00] Phatori: Holy Paladin! Shockadin build
[2:44:02] Sebleh: @MooniexVibes You wouldn't use Regrowth except for the instant casts as a defensive.
[2:44:03] heronymusbots: great question
[2:44:04] Corncannon1: boomie ofc :)
[2:44:04] sim967: phase 2
[2:44:12] MooniexVibes: @sebleh oh thank god
[2:44:15] huxi468: Gonna try out 2hand enhance shaman..  up to 145% attackspeed + windfury <3
[2:44:20] Sebleh: The time spent building Regrowths for a single filler spell buff is a MASSIVE loss @MooniexVibes
[2:44:23] Elembry_us: I like watching SoD. Have a guildie who plays and he streams it for us. playing it isn't for me.
[2:44:29] heronymusbots: google says 8/9, is it out?
[2:44:42] sim967: won’t be playing until Friday
[2:44:43] MooniexVibes: @sebleh I was not impressed lol
[2:44:43] Phatori: @heronymusbots later today yes
[2:44:52] heronymusbots: 40 lvl cap?
[2:44:55] Sebleh: Like casting 5 regrowths to buff a single Wrath by 100% is silly since you can just cast 6 wraths in the same amount of time @MooniexVibes
[2:44:55] heronymusbots: or 50?
[2:44:56] Phatori: ye
[2:45:02] Phatori: 40

[2:45:24] Sebleh: Yeah same
[2:45:26] MooniexVibes: I like that fantasy a lot more
[2:45:31] heronymusbots: fuck it, its time to get back into azeroth and smoke lots of weed
[2:45:50] MooniexVibes: also I wish there was a feral/boomie hero talent set lol that could be spicy or absolute car weaving hell lol
[2:45:56] MooniexVibes: *cat not car
[2:46:02] Sebleh: I thought the trees moonfire stuff could be good to remove a bunch of ramp time but nagoogoo made a good point that you'd want them more for the damage buff after your setup than to help set up.
[2:46:07] MooniexVibes: “For the rest of my days”
[2:46:07] Aegatron: got dramatic all of a sudden

[3:14:02] Kuroz: @Sebleh  A friend of mine just told me you once said Italians can't make bread, that our bread is unsalted and tastes like nothing. You probably ate bread once in like Florence where they specifically make unsalted bread and talked shit about the whole country when our bread and baking in general is ages above everyone else. Get more informed before shouting baseless opinions next time 🍞 pepePhoneU

[3:57:09] cursedchesh: Question for anyone who can help. Returning to WoW after an 11 year hiatus
[3:57:11] cursedchesh: As far as mythic+ score goes, if I do say a +10 DHT, then a +++11 DHT, then go back to and do a ++10 DHT will I gain any score for a better tun time or would I have gained it all from the doing the +++11?
[3:57:32] Humisenx: you gained all from the 11
[3:57:35] StephixOne: A ++10 cannot be a better run time than a +++11
[3:57:39] StephixOne: For one
[3:57:43] Humisenx: you get a set score for each run, dht +++11 is better than any 10
[3:57:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:57:52] cursedchesh: ok, ty ty
[3:57:57] Sebleh: @cursedchesh you only get score from getting a better time on the same key level or timing a higher level key
[3:58:10] BizBichou: modCheck wasnt this a 29 i tabbed for like 10 minutes
[3:58:14] Hkns_ivan: with that song it makes you want to turn down the key ;c
[3:58:15] Sebleh: but score is individual per dungeon and there is scoring for fortified weeks and tyrannical weeks
[3:58:19] StephixOne: @BizBichou Was a 30 before that
[3:58:27] StephixOne: Tab back in 20 mins and it's a 25
[3:58:45] GrimWizard: nahh trust in the 28
[3:58:48] GrimWizard: Prayge
[3:58:50] BizBichou: Cat
[3:58:53] mattt1024: does the speed of the clear only affect key level gain?
[3:58:54] StephixOne: ok trusting
[3:59:11] JookieZ: What nameplates are you using? They stack so much nicer than what I'm currently using

[6:22:53] Sebleh: tenéis*
[6:23:00] onegunpete: just casually reading chat, learning a new language, and running +28 keys...
[6:23:00] Sebleh: no chat this is Spain Spanish
[6:23:03] Sebleh: get your shit together
[6:23:21] Sebleh: She’s not learning general Spanish
[6:23:23] sw00p_tv: Oh rip
[6:23:25] Sebleh: Vosotros tenéis
[6:23:28] Fausstty: you're using another mood
[6:23:29] Sebleh: iirc
[6:23:34] Fausstty: it's not in present

[6:24:34] LoLOkanak: why do you prov an eclipse then incarn instead of just hitting incarn fisrt
[6:24:36] Sebleh: Naguura tienes que usar forma de oso o tomas forma de piso.
[6:24:42] E5Mz: @Naguura don't learn spanish from spain, it sucks LUL
[6:24:43] Fausstty: do dañar PepeLaugh
[6:25:03] or3g: forma de piso
[6:25:07] or3g: lol
[6:25:18] Thalinan: wow yo no sabia que @Naguura  podia hablar espanol tan perfectamente!
[6:25:19] SmiLeSE: beber
[6:25:21] Draemonia: beber
[6:25:23] breaccglas123: Beber
[6:25:29] Jarlan23: beber a cute word look at it
[6:25:29] Sebleh: tomar or beber
[6:25:50] Sebleh: beber is not irregular
[6:25:52] breaccglas123: No, it's not irregular
[6:25:52] Draemonia: its regular
[6:26:07] E5Mz: im gonna drink = yo voy a beber
[6:26:08] Draemonia: bebo
[6:26:09] Fausstty: MadgeClap
[6:26:09] breaccglas123: Right!
[6:26:10] Sebleh: Yo bebo, tú bebes,
[6:26:20] Sebleh: el/ella bebe
[6:26:22] sw00p_tv: MadgeClap
[6:26:28] Sebleh: which is the same word for baby tbh naguuraSip
[6:26:34] SmiLeSE: bebois
[6:26:37] E5Mz: nosotros bebemos
[6:26:39] SmiLeSE: eboys
[6:26:47] breaccglas123: No
[6:26:49] Sebleh: “el bebe” can mean “he’s drinking” or “the male baby”
[6:26:50] E5Mz: ellos beben, ella bebe, tu bebes, el bebe
[6:26:52] xoliathe: quite the route it seems
[6:26:52] Draemonia: beben
[6:27:01] breaccglas123: Bebeis
[6:27:05] Misshaa237: ellos beben, nosotros bebemos
[6:27:20] Fausstty: el bebé bebe
[6:27:22] E5Mz: yep, bebe its baby
[6:27:25] onegunpete: how about if the male baby is drinking?
[6:27:33] vikutoru11: @Sebleh but the pronounciation is different, yeah?
[6:27:40] carlosthesloth: ya
[6:27:40] E5Mz: @vikutoru11 it is
[6:27:44] breaccglas123: Bebe y bebe is the same word fot both meanings
[6:27:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:28:09] E5Mz: bebe its used for boy or girl
[6:28:10] survhunterdream: yes
[6:28:13] breaccglas123: Bebe is for both genders the same as english
[6:28:14] Sebleh: if the male baby is drinking you say “el bebe bebe”
[6:28:15] E5Mz: exactly
[6:28:18] Misshaa237: bebe  es de beber, tomar drink, bebé es baby
[6:28:24] Fausstty: yeah cause baby is about the age, not the gender
[6:29:06] vikutoru11: @Fausstty they way I read you name as "Fastussy" LUL
[6:29:15] E5Mz: oh man you gotta learn about "HAY" "AY" AND "AHI" LUL
[6:29:28] Fausstty: @vikutoru11 KEKW
[6:30:29] Fausstty: Go back quick! Peeporun
[6:30:39] vikutoru11: Peeporun
[6:31:15] Fausstty: quite a multitasking you got going on here... Eating apple, learning spanish and +28
[6:31:51] E5Mz: @Fausstty she can handle that
[6:32:10] dezolatedx: I was so confused for a sec, just tuned in and I was like "Why is she watching a replay iof her own key?" xd
[6:32:39] Sebleh: naguura just eating an apple like that… how often do you wash your keycaps so they’re not sticky and dirty from fooding while M+ing? Waiting
[6:33:11] Fausstty: sticky keys help with the dps

[6:34:12] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[6:34:37] QuaternionSlerp: so silly that the puddles on the ground go away. Kinda makes the space denial mechanic not a thing
[6:34:49] Draemonia: I really love your stream either in englisch, spanish or german keep doing what you love
[6:35:24] Hydrominus: hard dungeon for me in pugs
[6:35:37] QuaternionSlerp: Im doing well, great to see you!
[6:35:51] bunta80: I'm watching for some new tips on this boss. Also mess it up on higher keys
[6:36:34] QuaternionSlerp: Yeah I definitely agree there. I think they should have balanced it a bit better though. LIke make people stack up and move together to be able to make it to a place where the puddles go away or something.
[6:36:54] NkKouros: @bunta80 watch an extremely high key on tyra vod on YouTube and keep an eye on movement Vs boss timers
[6:36:57] Sebleh: well it’s not a soft enrage anymore. it’s just area denial and still requires some planning
[6:36:58] QuaternionSlerp: Which of course is more dangerous than just being in your own spot
[6:37:15] Fausstty: That boss is a gimmick anyways, the first part is what matters to save time
[6:37:25] NkKouros: The spiders at some point cap out as well (they stop spawning)
[6:37:28] Fausstty: I mean, any competent group should do it, but you know... shit happens
[6:37:36] bunta80: @NkKouros Thanks I will!

[6:38:49] Heapsofjoy: is cast while moving starfall still a thing?
[6:38:55] Kuroz: @Heapsofjoy nope
[6:38:59] truthlol: hate this boss
[6:39:03] Fausstty: Man the spiders back in BFA did a TON of dmg
[6:39:08] daconcion: That spider just walked by like, Nah, we're cool, this rogue though
[6:39:27] fr4xt3r: just bearform LUL
[6:39:28] MaxGrandpre: I don't understand, just bear form and it should work !
[6:39:31] MaxGrandpre: Kappa
[6:39:59] Xevenna: is that a weak aura for the upgrade thing at the end of the dungeon or is that an addon?
[6:40:02] Guni_: @Naguura Der Mage ist großer Fan von dir Pog
[6:40:03] MooniexVibes: the fact that a 28 key still just drops hero gear is mind blowing to me
[6:40:13] Kuroz: @Xevenna details
[6:40:17] Fausstty: DANKIES
[6:40:24] NkKouros: @mooniexvibes because raid is harder ofc /s
[6:40:49] MooniexVibes: 🧢
[6:40:56] Xevenna: @Kuroz oh really? i havent ran any keys this week. was it recently changed or is it an option i have to turn  on?

[6:44:54] richardmu: shouldn't ipad shipping need to be signed?
[6:45:04] Kuroz: not likely
[6:45:07] Sebleh: @richardmu someone signed for it
[6:45:11] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:45:24] Sebleh: yeah they’re probably gonna consider it delivered
[6:45:38] Noxx_be: maybe it didn't fit in the mailbox  and they brought it to the nearest postalpoint
[6:45:38] Celissah: What would you think of a system where you'd be able to buy a "keystone enchant" with Token of Merits to save the key from "one deplete". So you'd be able to get like a maximum of 6 of these per week. But you'd still be able to not "fu*k" up your key totally.
[6:45:39] Draemonia: the delivery companies are not allowed to leave apple products like phones and iphones in the mailboxes, so is it lost?

[6:48:10] AceReformed: Keys should never deplete, period
[6:48:14] zebajin: coz 20 keys aint toxic enuff
[6:48:30] Sebleh: I think keys should double deplete actually
[6:48:43] akroma433: u can deplete at npc np
[6:48:48] Sebleh: take it back to the OG deplete where it drops no loot AND also gives no score AND also it drops by 3 levels
[6:48:48] timbender: pretty sure new players get hard stuck at some point
[6:48:54] sim967: depletes are how a group finds out current capabilities in keys
[6:48:59] Eatmeillidan: above 25 you have 3 chances before the key is downgraded
[6:49:18] AceReformed: In fact I think they should fuck off with the entire key system, and simply copy paste the Grifting system from D3, you interact with the stone, select the difficulty you want to clear, and only after a succesful clear you can go to the next key level
[6:49:43] Sebleh: listen wow players want a bigger challenge so just make it a challenge to want to do it in the first place
[6:49:46] Sebleh: EZ
[6:50:03] Tsinis: i like the idea of a one time non deplete  for training
[6:50:37] Sebleh: I can’t believe they’re just gonna tell you all the 10.2.6 secrets like that
[6:50:49] AceReformed: ooo right I need to do @Naguura or she wont read wall of texts Sadge
[6:51:12] Tsinis: once ou get a new key the first time won't deplete
[6:51:40] Toadcop: depletes are just time waste idk. who defends it has just some mental disorder. somekind of stockholm syndrom. its just hard to time a key and they even more punish you after
[6:51:42] AceReformed: And what exactly is wrong with infinitely trying a key..?
[6:51:55] Toadcop: it becomes more about social connections rather than your skill
[6:52:39] AceReformed: So wait you're actually unironically okay with the fact that if i need a atal 30 for example, i'd have to play my own key a million times, bounce between 28 and 29 untill the 29 that I clear is a 30 atal? KEKW Yeh no this system is entirely dog
[6:52:55] Stricken79: how's th key going NAguura? YEP
[6:52:59] Sebleh: @acereformed just play better 4Head
[6:53:10] Toadcop: no you wouldn't
[6:53:16] Toadcop: because day has 24 hours
[6:53:33] AceReformed: You're right, playing better would just fix all my problems YEP

[6:53:53] Tsinis: I don't like the idea of never  deplete
[6:53:55] Stricken79: @AceReformed I can hook you up with a 30 atal...for...favour slootCreep
[6:54:05] AceReformed: Ooo my, threatening me with a good time? slootBrows
[6:54:06] Luk777ls: just look at jb raiding that dude has has every cd planned and with a weakaura telling him when to use
[6:54:10] bielich132: imagine you deplete a +29 pug key bc of a mini mistake and you can go the same key with the same groupagain to time it. thats the good side of NOT depleting
[6:54:11] Tsinis: but i feel like we should have  1 chance  in case something goes wrong
[6:54:12] zebajin: then do a lower key lvl where u just can blast
[6:54:48] Sebleh: like your key had three lives
[6:54:59] AceReformed: Yeh no way she is not capping rn
[6:55:02] bielich132: @AceReformed thats exactly the point
[6:55:06] santana194613: What about the way to aquire key should that make it harder to get
[6:55:19] Kuroz: or she just has a different opinion
[6:55:26] Kuroz: that she stated for 7 years
[6:55:29] Kuroz: over and over
[6:55:38] shockadinz1: people would definitely be willing to take more risks when making a group if you could redo the key aswell
[6:55:38] AceReformed: I already did, scroll up YEP
[6:55:39] alicemch: ConcernFroge chats gettin a little heated
[6:55:45] bielich132: @santana194613 then you will have even less keys in the LFG tool
[6:55:48] Nativo1: Well, Challenge Mode was "Infinite Try"  but also you dont do it to your weekly vault
[6:55:48] Teraision: you just wrong Madge
[6:55:52] Sebleh: limited restarts would be way better than infinite. there’s some real delulu sweats in lfg doing mdi pulls on 15s and they’ll sweat every pull on free resets
[6:56:06] sim967: I think the deplete system is fine, just wish we could use generic keys and select what dungeon we want to run it in
[6:56:11] Eatmeillidan: @Toadcop thats a lie. no one likes warriors
[6:56:11] santana194613: Doing the duengen many times that give them hard time to make new event
[6:56:13] AceReformed: No I just think this take is a very bad one, depleting key promotes a very toxic competitive Environment
[6:56:15] felsonthewarrior: you mean by Microsoft
[6:56:17] zebajin: i dont feel depletes are the issue the issue is ppl leaving keys when they think they are gona deplete
[6:56:55] bielich132: @zebajin but bro. imagine people leave the key and you can just list the same key again, without having to go one keylevel lower just because of that shitty leaver
[6:57:08] Sebleh: I also don’t like warriors igochu @eatmeillidan
[6:57:19] shockadinz1: but SMOrc
[6:57:22] blind_dood: and 4 warriors?
[6:57:28] andyandrzej: Silverucho is a polish best mage
[6:57:33] daconcion: To be fair, we shouldn't invite warriors to keys anyways

[6:57:48] Stricken79: yeah!
[6:57:52] Stricken79: you need 5 warriors!
[6:57:53] alicemch: Nerdge
[6:58:00] Stricken79: and and health pots
[6:58:01] Eatmeillidan: BASED
[6:58:02] Sebleh: @gergrunt yeah pretty much this
[6:58:05] luxumbra69: i'm also doing a 28 MR right now!
[6:58:14] luxumbra69: oh, i mean 18. my b.
[6:58:24] zebajin: @bielich132 yeah but it would still make the game worse coz u would deplete way more keys coz then ppl just buy a boost first week and have a xx key the whole season and good players can build keys  easy enuff
[6:58:33] ParfumAmerican: like it is now
[6:58:35] shockadinz1: 5 warriors will be best. I will not accept any argument against it
[6:58:48] alicemch: @shockadinz1 PepeLaugh
[6:59:02] Sebleh: naguuraOMEGALUL naguuraOMEGALUL
[6:59:05] Krimoshock: @Naguura Is it better to use fury of Elune instead of New Moon when u're low geared?
[6:59:09] zounikin: i fucking love to see a tank that is tanking for a boomking and taking all the room xD
[6:59:16] AceReformed: Great, so that would be a problem blizzard has to fix, we can't just hold back improvements on the system because balancing might be off? also for what it's worth, if you play a pug you will be forced into the meta, wherever you like it or not, depleting keys simply adds a hypertoxic / competitive aspect to m+ that is entirely unecessary @Naguura
[6:59:33] Nativo1: just w8 for oracle in next xpac buff magic damage done or physical damage
[6:59:46] bielich132: @AceReformed fair point
[7:00:08] FifiBelle_: You're thinking about how it'll benefit you to catch up to the current high keys on the current system but obviously it's going to completely change - you'll be even further from the top players if the top players (and others) have infinite tries
[7:00:29] hablospanish: NAGUURA COOKING
[7:00:46] gergrunt: making m+ a participation award and not an execution thing is a slippery slope
[7:01:02] Sebleh: it already is @gergrunt
[7:01:16] luxumbra69: non-depleting keys is a pug nightmare tbh. imagine that one shit DPS that just gets carried every week? keys on alts would be HORRIFIC.
[7:01:34] Sebleh: HUH
[7:01:44] AceReformed: @luxumbra69 ????
[7:01:45] Tsinis: i feel like most of the high keys pushers would rather be able to choose their keys rather than just never deplete
[7:01:59] FifiBelle_: @n1d4lee Dude...thats so cringe of you to say
[7:02:13] zebajin: @luxumbra69 worse if its a shit tank or healer u can do keys with 1 dps being dogshit
[7:02:14] Tsinis: like getting a  31 is nice but if it's the wrong one it feels worse than just depleting a  31 to a  30
[7:02:15] gergrunt: @sebleh to a degree yea. but the harsh truth is that high end content shouldn’t be easy. then you have objectively poor players making life harder on skilled players
[7:02:32] santana194613: What you think of bosses have chance to drop extra key
[7:02:53] AceReformed: @Tsinis Yeh so that is why I earlier said, copy the greater rifting system from D3, make it so that you can interact with the stone inside dungeons, select the key level and you get infinite tries, you can only go to the next level if you time the previous
[7:03:21] Sebleh: I agree @gergrunt but most people see M+ as a loot carousel with participation points
[7:03:40] itsdatwoowoo: the real challenge for warrior is that while pugging, folks only select meta classes.

[7:03:56] gergrunt: @sebleh oh 100%. no lies there. it stinks
[7:03:57] Tsinis: @AceReformed Yeah but I agree with naguura  i don't like infinite tries  a deplete protection of  1 times seems like a fair inbetween
[7:03:58] itsdatwoowoo: also, this season, all dps feels like they are in a good spot for damage.  it comes down to utility and defensives
[7:04:02] skissmann: naguuraClap
[7:04:04] ParfumAmerican: ONLY POSITIVE AFFIXES WILL FIX
[7:04:10] ParfumAmerican: sorry caps
[7:04:44] Stricken79: @itsdatwoowoo I've mained warrior for 17 years, look at raiderio there are dps warriors even pushing really high keys. It's not an excuse to not push to where you want just becasue you are x class or spec
[7:05:03] AceReformed: @Tsinis So you'd rather deplete, farm it up, deplete, farm it up untill you get the key that you need..? like if you need a 30 atal, you'll be farming your key untill you get a 30 atal
[7:05:38] zebajin: @itsdatwoowoo well automaticjack has a dps warrior in his push grp so they can do it
[7:06:00] itsdatwoowoo: @Stricken79 i think you are proving my point.  classes and specs are in a good spot right now.  pugs bring meta, but the best player is the right things to bring.  unfortunately, there is no "io" for that.
[7:06:09] Tsinis: @AceReformed I'd rather farm a time a  29 get a  30 and choose  which one i want and the first time i try it  it does not deplete
[7:06:11] itsdatwoowoo: instead, pugs have to take a risk for someone on a non-meta class for their own key
[7:06:45] gergrunt: @acereformed I think your point is solid. but getting better at m+ means failing and practicing. there will easily still be toxicity if a group doesn’t time a key first try. toxicity is independent of depletes as well
[7:06:47] Sebleh: honestly I respect the choice to not go in.
[7:07:07] zebajin: @itsdatwoowoo thats coz the meta classes more often has fotm rerollers and fotm rerollers usualy are safer pick
[7:07:09] AceReformed: @Tsinis And then what if it does deplete, what if you time the 30 and now you want a 31, you'll be back to point A, why do we need this entire in between hussle, just select > attempt > go, it is such a waste of time
[7:07:13] bunta80: I'd also like drums to be like tranquillity so a 100% more effective in dungeons so you don't have to have a lust class.
[7:07:32] Stricken79: @itsdatwoowoo then do the work, get a team to push with, become a part of a community. Blind pugging doesn't really get any player anywhere. Sooner or later if you wish to succeed yoiu need the friends to do it
[7:07:41] Sebleh: honestly someone’s dipshit attitude of getting toxic on their group for depleting a key shouldn’t be rewarded by having infinite attempts at a key level. part of being part of the high push scene is being amicable and friendly to get invited back after mistakes.

[7:07:50] itsdatwoowoo: @zebajin im not defending it.  i know why.  however, i would actually argue that a lot of class changers ARE NOT as good
[7:07:53] andyandrzej: Repair Caroline
[7:07:54] StreamElements: Repair this wideASS
[7:08:27] Malicone: imagine if you cant release for those trash :p
[7:08:29] AceReformed: @gergrunt Okay except, imagine if you are not good at m+ yet, lets say a +20 is the max you can do, infinitely running a +20 untill you're ready for a +21 is no differend from the current system?? like all we need to do is remove this intermediate point of depleting keys
[7:08:35] itsdatwoowoo: @Stricken79 i agree!  there are people that pug up to 29...or even 30.  doing it with a group is more fun.  doing it without a group and non-meta will be extremely challenging is my point
[7:08:54] AceReformed: I still have yet to hear why we need depleting
[7:08:55] Tsinis: @AceReformed If it depletes this means you were maybe not ready for a 30 therefore you get an other  29 and maybe the next time wil lbe more refined i don't have the right answer of course  but depleting is not too bad if there is room for error
[7:08:58] Etersarte: if you keep loosing the top 1% over and over eventually  youll have lost alot of your playerbase
[7:09:37] Tsinis: lot's of player strive to reach the elite  if there is no high end there is no goal to reach which is sad
[7:09:45] torksss: repair no ?
[7:09:46] StreamElements: Repair this wideASS
[7:09:56] Sebleh: @torksss she will when she has to
[7:10:09] Sebleh: if it’s yellow let it mellow. if it’s red get it repaired.
[7:10:12] Wupday: YES I CAN
[7:10:21] Tsinis: the same way  some people are very judgmental of the casuals / lower level player we need to cater to all spectrum of the playerbase
[7:10:21] Teraision: be a reasonable arsehole NOTED
[7:10:40] itsdatwoowoo: you can't cater a game to the top 1%.  unless you want to lose more players.
[7:10:59] FifiBelle_: @itsdatwoowoo That's not what she said though
[7:11:03] Teraision: @itsdatwoowoo you can if it doesn't make it worse for the rest
[7:11:13] Sebleh: but you can cater the top 1% difficulty to the top 1% tho

[7:11:15] TheAwesomePeter: So you mean I can't be toxic to highend players? I must be toxic to everyone the same? Hmm
[7:11:24] AceReformed: @Tsinis So, let's follow up on this logic, you're not ready for a 30, but you can clear the 29, yet the difference between 29 and 30, is nothing? you'd go back to the 29, clear it, and try the 30 again? that would imply you are ready for the level 30, but not for the 31
[7:11:29] gergrunt: @acereformed I think the point I’m trying to make is that having stakes in the game breeds accountability. if every key was either win or neutral, do players really try to get better??
[7:11:35] itsdatwoowoo: @Naguura apologies.  i wasnt responding to you.  was responding to a few folks in chat :(
[7:11:40] FifiBelle_: I think there's a small minority not listening for sure, but the rest of us hear and agree with you :D
[7:11:47] badactionhiro: I do remember past Naguura says she's so positive she needs chat to be negative. jk jk
[7:12:02] Sebleh: Nagoogoo im hella offended you said we don’t listen I KNOW TOM IS BIKEOLOGIST AND MARKUS IS FAKE ARCHITECT I REMEMBER Smadge
[7:12:08] trollinmyimp: I think blizzard is going to spend development time on what's best for the majority of the player base. They have limited resources and budgets and i'm sure now they are going to be hounded by their microsoft overlords.
[7:12:42] zebajin: non depleting keys would make the game way worse for the avrage player
[7:12:46] Kahlandra: i just looked at chat but have people just tried to git gud
[7:13:04] Sebleh: honestly the best solution is to give all the players who hate the depletion system a way to run through dn
[7:13:27] Sebleh: seblehHey @kahlandra naguuraFlower
[7:13:30] sukoWoW: WoW players? toxic?1?! never!! KEKW
[7:13:31] AceReformed: @gergrunt Uhh, yes? Neutral = not winning = not improving, if you have room to improve you'll go again? HUH In the end you're still doing the exact same thing, pushing rio? do you currently just give up if the key you play gives no rio? because that's all you do with M+

[7:13:59] TheAwesomePeter: It's because the decisions made by highend players shape the meta that affects the rest of the playerbase negatively, so we just respond by hating them completely LUL
[7:14:12] Babyfirefly: F THE ALLIANCE
[7:14:43] Kahlandra: @Sebleh  catBlush
[7:14:53] itsClubby: do we?
[7:14:54] Kahlandra: @Kuroz  naguuraFlower naguuraNudes
[7:14:55] Stricken79: I play with my guildies YEP idgaf what anyone is doing in a 30 key. It's a disconnect to be sure but I really don't understand why people pug solo 24/7 like this is a single player game
[7:15:19] Zapzoda: tell that to the PVP players
[7:15:21] Zapzoda: XD
[7:15:30] TheAwesomePeter: we don't talk about pvp players
[7:15:31] Roqqz: Roqqz subscribed with Prime. 
[7:15:36] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[7:15:47] ParfumAmerican: because it feels like the only feedback they listen to is the end game player, and that's unforgivable for the others
[7:15:48] AceReformed: Think about it, depleting keys is the reason why wow is so meta hungry, why the game is toxic af at times, because the entire system is designed to waste the players time, no one wants to take a hunter if it isnt meta, no one wants to risk their key that they need for score, no matter if it is high or low, what does this do? it forces everyone to play a meta class, or take the increased risk of depleting a key
[7:15:48] Kjempebikkja: i think alot of top end players comes out as toxic and arrogant so many casuals hate they :)
[7:15:58] gergrunt: @acereformed no I run plenty of keys that don’t provide rio, or very small increase. like I said earlier I think your point is good friend. I just worry about what happens when there is no penalty for failure. we can certainly still discuss making that penalty less harsh.
[7:16:05] Tsinis: @AceReformed well you kinda stopped on something rather irrelevant there the point is to make a ranking relevant ( here  io score ) it has to come from consistency because consistency is  skill and not luck right, so with no deplete  you can get more score by trying  the same lucky pull hundreds of time or rely on that lucky tank dodge with a deplete  you can work on that consistency
[7:16:09] Chkndh: I think people overestimate how much casual players care about this stuff, they will keep playing the game and enjoy it no matter what, shouldn't design around them
[7:16:14] Cyberkaia_: @TheAwesomePeter the problem here its ppl "following the meta" being no "meta players".. You could time a 23-24 whit every single class on game RN. But ppl think they are "meta player" on a 23 IMO
[7:16:34] VenasTheMenace: Do you have the Love Rocket?
[7:16:43] meistercap: im not playing on my rogue anymore cause the game feels unplayable on 28/29 keys + :(
[7:16:53] Kuroz: @VenasTheMenace she doesn't care about mounts
[7:17:07] VenasTheMenace: @Kuroz oh okay, my bad
[7:17:14] TheAwesomePeter: @TheAwesomePeter Yeah, but try applying to a 24 with a non meta class and tell me how many hours you sat thre looking at your screen in tears
[7:17:14] StreamElements: 07:04:12 PM CET
[7:17:16] Sebleh: hey naguura you died naguuraSip
[7:17:20] TiPera: @Stricken79 I don't play anymore but U will be surprised how many top players like to play the game alone, talking about m+. I always tried to make a consistent group and go discord but lots of them just dont like to talk or are afraid/shy and some of them were toxic if something went wrong in the key even though we were playing together for like 20m or so LUL
[7:17:23] drackene: Your pending repairs make me nervous
[7:17:24] Tsinis: yellowman !
[7:17:25] meistercap: not the class
[7:17:40] meistercap: It's the fact that puging feels just so unrewarding
[7:17:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[7:17:59] meistercap: I'm playing que simulator instead of the actual game since I'm puging
[7:18:03] Sebleh: Damn I was expecting a “shut up”
[7:18:10] Sebleh: hmmMeeting
[7:18:18] Tsinis: @meistercap that's the law for a lot of classes unfortunately
[7:18:28] zebajin: if u are a Pug player if u dont like  hate urself u play the meta classes
[7:18:30] Cyberkaia_: @TheAwesomePeter yeah, exctly my point, ppl thinking they are meta players on a 23. But thats more on player bases than Blizzard faults
[7:18:38] AceReformed: @Tsinis WoW has a million aspects that has to do with luck, easy example, look at BRH, last boss on 31 tyran for example, whenever anyone takes x2 shadowbolt at any given time = auto dead, you might just deplete the key because of that, i could literally give you a million more boss mechanics that could make or break your run at top end level, and you simply cannot avoid
[7:18:47] AceReformed: Or archmage sol
[7:19:25] Akyran: they fixed that @AceReformed , you can only get 1 bolt for each player now
[7:19:50] AceReformed: ??? no?
[7:19:53] meistercap: @Tsinis ye defo, i didnt mean its smth related to my class. I just said I'm not playing on my main anymore cause of the que simulation
[7:20:10] TheAwesomePeter: @TheAwesomePeter Pugging is so bad that you wanna bring every meta class to your key so you don't waste your time. I don't care what the person is playing if I'm with friends on discord
[7:20:14] Akyran: @AceReformed yes, its 3 bolts on 3 diff ppl, short break, 3 bolts on 3 diff ppl again
[7:20:17] ParfumAmerican: so how does it feel to play 40 min for nothing? cuz one leave for good or bad reason ..that is the only problem
[7:20:22] AceReformed: @Akyran Not you lmao, I mean caro
[7:20:28] itsdatwoowoo: is the feeling that folks want more rewards or tiers for different levels of play?  you get top gear at an 18 and the only reason to push higher is either 1) fun or 2) title.  and to be clear, you can easily do ~24s this season if you learn/know the dungeon and your class
[7:20:28] Akyran: @AceReformed ah ok ok :D
[7:20:36] AceReformed: Caro the meta is already set in stone, no such thing as off meta for people who pug
[7:20:56] Sebleh: no depletes would turn live keys into tgp
[7:21:01] Tsinis: @AceReformed yeah but they reduced a lot that rng changing a lot of mechanics  to not do that kind of targeting it's also not the same kind of rng the variance is much lower
[7:21:21] itsClubby: im going to need a paint drawing to explain this
[7:21:36] AceReformed: Yeh so? again all I currently hear is that blizzard should do a better job balancing classes??
[7:21:54] Stricken79: @TiPera sounds terrifying, I've made so many good friends in this game. I remember when I was a pvp player and I joined a really big pvp guild where I knew no one. I think I became twice as depressed as is normal for me and I started becoming the most toxic drunk player that nobody wants to meet. It wasn't until I met good people and joined their community that it dragged me out of that horrible place.
[7:21:56] TiPera: but u're missing a variable, not everyone has 12hours a day to play the game. I understand your point tho
[7:21:58] AceReformed: You're trying to defend a shit system with the another arguement that blizzards dogshit balance is what stops us from improving a toxic system? KEKW
[7:22:01] drackene: Compromise by making a key deplete after the second failure?
[7:22:07] Sebleh: yeah let’s fuck up the system first then balance classes that’s the best solution I’ve heard to fucking up the experience for everyone.
[7:22:10] Wupday: and now we back to the general balance issues in wow
[7:22:23] NkKouros: Also not wanting what's good for the top 1% is a straw man. They are the people who are limit testing anyways.
[7:22:37] olivoilolja: yellow xd
[7:22:50] Teraision: eggcecute AYAYA
[7:23:10] Matus1k: better comps will always do better keys no matterhow many tries you have, with no depletion at least ppl wont regret inviting off meta specs
[7:23:18] TheAwesomePeter: @Naguura Yeah, because Blizz nerfs the good classes instead of buffing the bad ones to the same level. I'm playing DH now in keys and I'm finishing runs with over 340k dps with no effort at all, while I'm pressing every single button on my warrior and can't do shit
[7:23:44] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[7:24:46] TomCat: it's 2024. Class balance could be achieved by dynamically throttling week to week based on historical performance of the past week. It wouldn't even require AI. Simple tech from the 90's would suffice
[7:24:59] TiPera: @Stricken79 I also have made so many friends with this game thats why I'm thinking of coming back. I miss the laughs and all of that in discord while raiding or just breaking keys LUL. Glad to hear u're doing better bro, I can understand that drinking every now and then is fun while gaming but everyday is just not healthy, much love
[7:25:40] Sebleh: the worst part about no depletes is imagine spending two days running the same +28 rise just for 5 points and not having the opportunity to reroll it into something else. people would get sick of it so fast
[7:25:56] FifiBelle_: People thinking you can perfectly balance classes for raids, mythics+, pvp, and all the possible things you can do in a game is wiiiild. Welcome to the gaming world!
[7:26:37] Wupday: they just gotta stop making dogpoo affixes
[7:26:46] TomCat: I don't think that the goal for 'class balance' is universally shared among the devs. Some may prefer giving players an option to play an OP class
[7:26:58] AceReformed: @Sebleh that is why I said, make it so that you need no keystone at all anymore, you simply interract with the dungeon stone ( ANY DUNGEON STONE) that you want to run, select the highest level of key you previously cleared, and run it Shruge You cba farming atal 35 for weeks for score? great go fall or rise
[7:27:02] SimenT94: If you don't like the wasted time of people leaving when depleted, imagine all the time you would waste EVERY time something in the key is not 100% optimal if you have Infinite tries
[7:27:29] slimicc: Demo does horrible on lower keys
[7:27:39] Sebleh: @acereformed but tbats not what I said naguuraSip
[7:27:40] Cyberkaia_: boomies on 0 to 20 keys are a meme Kappa
[7:27:41] Wupday: @SimenT94 it would be the same but atleast you get to try again
[7:27:42] AceReformed: @SimenT94 Non? Because of the fact that you have an infinite amount of tries, meaning you are free to take risks, invite whoever you deem worthy for the key you want to run..?

[7:29:23] itsClubby: still do
[7:29:27] Tsinis: If not making balance I wished we had frequent communication on what the team is looking at, like do they think frost dk or ele shaman are fine in their current state compared to the rest of the roster of classes, the comparative difference between vdh and brewmaster aswell
[7:29:31] hydr0h: sometimes we complain about things we enjoy doing because we care
[7:29:35] Kuroz: you loved the maw pepePhoneU
[7:29:37] Cyberkaia_: Torghast KEKW
[7:29:45] censiGFY: We hated korthia because it was mandatory AND badly made the 2 first weeks before they start to fix stuff
[7:29:50] ParfumAmerican: the biggest reward from this game comes in form of : playing with other people - the state of m+ atm is 0 conversation, is like playing alone with other alone players  - that's the only problem, no engagement
[7:30:00] Kuroz: advance groups, kadiien fell through the floor again guys
[7:30:01] TomCat: People hate places they can't use flying. I enjoyed them. People forget about Goblin Gliders and toys to launch you into the air like the Darkmoon Cannon
[7:30:03] Kuroz: robin is late
[7:30:08] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[7:30:18] Xevenna: shadowlands had so many issues. so many systems one on top of another. made balancing issues so hard for anyone
[7:30:26] sim967: misery loves company
[7:30:27] Teraision: So if it's bad enough it's good again
[7:30:30] Sebleh: a lot of that hate for Korthia and the Maw came from a false perspective of how much you were forced to do it, whether really forced or because people made you think that you have to do it.
[7:30:31] Ilunius: Blizzard does this every season, a new continent filled with fetchquests that u have to run to keep up, its boring tedious work just to keep ur online numbers upo
[7:30:38] Sebleh: just like Island Expeditions too
[7:30:48] hydr0h: When BC launched they promised us Air to Air combat on flying mounts. I still have the original box with 5 cds
[7:30:50] Tsinis: Going back to the maw or torghast to farm mount and transmog is not bad these days, the biggest difference is that it's optional now
[7:30:54] Sebleh: oh yeah
[7:30:57] censiGFY: Let s not talk about onyx annulet farm in 10.0.5 also, what a bad design look of gameplay felt like a chore
[7:31:07] Cyberkaia_: @Sebleh we were force, all system relays on runes droped on there, and craft mats too
[7:31:20] Xevenna: can you imagine having to get pathfinder to fly in the world  after dragonflying right off the bat? lol
[7:31:26] zoaii: horrific visions ptsd is coming up
[7:31:26] Sebleh: i don’t level characters or play classic anymore because it sucked to do solo in vanilla.
[7:31:39] TiPera: Even though the maw and Korthia was bad I remember doing it with my friends/guildies and it was fun cuz U're just autopilot and laughing about other stuff that happen during your day or wtv. For me the worst was torghast if u had alts but still
[7:32:16] Kuroz: meeting soon reminder @Naguura hmmMeeting
[7:32:17] Sebleh: a 5 hour BRD run in Vanilla was fun because you hung out with your buddies not because it was a fun dungeon
[7:32:24] Sebleh: seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk meeting soon seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk
[7:32:40] Tsinis: @TiPera i also remember  my guild and I just being in discord and just calling for rare switching shards with each others  calling when a mount drop mob spawned... it was fun

[7:33:18] Tsinis: i mean the early expac  rare farm was very degen :D the first week
[7:33:31] TiPera: @Tsinis Exactly!!! That part was fun and exciting for sure. I miss WoW BibleThump
