[2:15:10] ShackSupp: ShackSupp gifted a Tier 1 sub to Alaquane! 
[2:15:10] Dagomarus: Well the good thing is that its just bug fixes and class tuning, no big systems to adjust, when you test systems you can only get data from that one thing, class tuning you get constant feedback as people play the game
[2:15:15] kohawk2121: Nov 22th will be Dflight.... numbers are too good to not run a release around it. Slands launced nov 23

[2:15:39] Rudric_Ice: hey i guess the 100 extra devs are testing the whole thing towCopium
[2:15:39] chobosek: If we take what Ion said during the Dragonflight reveal at face value, we might get the game in December?
[2:15:42] Malexand6742: like thats my guess
[2:15:45] chobosek: He said the game was far along
[2:15:50] mmrghost7: i mean there is supposed to be 0 burrowed power at the start right , not much to test beside classes and zones

[2:16:39] Malexand6742: I think an expansion themed M+ would be dope
[2:16:44] Recording_on_the_grass: towOof
[2:16:45] Hakazo: @Towelliee Many are talking about the fear of lack of content on dragonflight, not much was said on reveal unlike previous expansions - opinions on that?

[2:16:48] Malexand6742: like every season is 2 xpacs
[2:16:48] poleon17: winter releases seem weird with their holiday schedule
[2:16:54] Dagomarus: The only feedback im gonna be pushing at every point is interupts need to be baseline for EVERYONE

[2:17:52] Dagomarus: as a tank i dont want to die in dragonflight because my dps “didn’t spec” into their interrupt on a fight we needed a interrupt
[2:17:53] jonoosborne: did you get to try the new class ?
[2:17:57] Rudric_Ice: give me Dire maul m+ :)
[2:18:39] Dagomarus: I wouldnt even do dire maul on normal when leveling, hated that place
[2:18:55] Weedweed: Gundrak is great
[2:19:02] Utmost777: I wonder if the M+ dungeons from older xpacs will drop the same gear  they used to and will they have updated models
[2:19:11] pavepawns: *inhales copium* dragonflight is the year of arcane and we are gonna be doing the 1st raid in december. *inhales whole tank of copium* I NEED MORE

[2:21:36] Hakazo: Hyped for professions imo
[2:21:46] caanan_: I wish I didnt need 36 keys to press
[2:22:03] Malexand6742: I want world quests backs tbh lol
[2:22:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: did you see you can transfer cosmic Flux to alts now? @towelliee
[2:22:06] Rudric_Ice: i think DF will be more of a casual expansion or maybe Vanilla esque expansion
[2:22:07] Crowargus: 1st patch is alwaays basic the first patch is where we get content
[2:22:12] Hakazo: @Towelliee Is world content something that we might see in alpha or later in the beta?
[2:22:49] Austei: dragon grinding Xpac rated M for mature oh no!
[2:22:51] DeeterDo: yeah was gonna say werent they like 5k

[2:26:49] shamp_z: technically its a stream
[2:27:02] Malexand6742: I mean they could have done it for 2023 though right?
[2:27:04] shamp_z: a podcast is auddio only
[2:27:09] Hakazo: @Towelliee Would you say that you still stand by the quote that "10.0 is going to be different in a good way" you said in shadowlands? Personally I already see the change in philosophy/visually but wondering incase there is more to be revealed <3 I'm excited
[2:27:22] Rudric_Ice: i think they will release DF this year don't count me on that tho

[5:34:11] FranciscoTheMage: but  you have to sub for that bag
[5:34:19] Rudric_Ice: man assasin rogue will be fun to play in DF
[5:35:05] Fnchentai: it's been a wekk saying next week alpha
[5:35:16] AerialAce94: most people will probably just care about talent trees assuming they are all ready
[5:35:37] feherlofia123: i dont get hoe 4 zones can be as big as northrend on size
[5:35:38] Mckhero: since canada lost internet i cant play blizz games :(
[5:35:48] ZakuzaGB: they must be confident with what they have if they only wanna do 4 and a bit months testing
[5:35:50] Akermay: Maybe this is cynical, but first week of alpha more of a marketing hit?
[5:35:53] Skars111: whes season 4 start agian?
[5:35:53] feherlofia123: this typo wtf
[5:36:03] Sielu11628: For Shadowlands Alpha, they did 1 zone and a few classes at a time at minimum level
[5:36:05] subversv: lol
[5:36:11] icemanj99: True, still interested in watching what you will stream about it though :)

[5:37:22] 3663Sharad: Do we know if the Dragonflight Ce will be available on Amazon? 15€ for shipping extra is hefty
[5:37:44] ZakuzaGB: why would they put dec 31st if its like a low chance to happen
[5:37:48] Klutar: I know people smarter than me have written up thoughts about the new trees that they don't seem to bad so far, but it still irks me that you have to now spend a talent point to get what used to be core abilities
[5:37:49] Nevindaz: towCopium towCopium towCopium

[5:43:18] PvtHudson093: So far they most likely shown off the talent tree;s tha are mostly in a finished state
[5:43:18] NilsMcMountain: I remember when something didn't get a texture in tbc and there was a checked cube outside org, people started worshiping it.
[5:43:18] subversv: shadowlands had literally necrotic wake and thats it
[5:43:18] Trif0ld: @Zivs tyty
[5:43:19] FrozenShades: Blizzard confirmed all classes and specs are playable and ZONES.
[5:43:20] thiccsushi: My guess was just talent trees and a starting zone
[5:43:21] Rudric_Ice: Kungen already testing the new Raid
[5:43:21] Akermay: I mean alpha is just the full game with some bugs right :D
[5:43:25] Vizzeek: me and my guild are gonna get CE on the alpha just you watch!!!

[5:43:52] FrozenShades: Are you going for the mount? @Towelliee
[5:44:03] Skars111: what do you guys think evokers will be more dominant in healing or DPS?
[5:44:04] shachlo322: @towelliee hey man, can you name the most fun and most disappointing expansion for you?
[5:44:19] NieIas: make a ticket and ask if blizz can check ur account to see if any of your chars has gotten it LUL

[5:44:31] FrozenShades: 569 attempts? I got it in 2 tries... pathetic.
[5:44:41] renaerocks: remember your Latin words
[5:44:44] subversv: yeah
[5:44:45] Reckless_Monk: blizz needs to stop giving people this idea they will ship in 2022 with no alpha out and 5 months to go
[5:44:53] subversv: the original torg
[5:44:54] havenbirch: bellular is not going to be that on edge i dont think, but i agree to temper expectations
[5:44:56] fooxytv: You must have that mount in an alts bag somewhere
[5:44:56] ZakuzaGB: half the talent trees have had "first mock up" written on them :')
[5:44:56] Dinermoe: wasnt it like shaman and mage
[5:45:00] Rudric_Ice: i hope evokers feels good to play
[5:45:03] Trif0ld: @Reckless_Monk I thought the 2022 release sounded a bit ambitious
[5:45:09] Akermay: Do we know if every profession will have specilizations or just a selection?
[5:45:12] mezza77: my son....
[5:45:14] Zivs: @MuzkaTV Ima say dps, healer meta is way harder to impact i feel

[5:45:32] Reckless_Monk: @trif0ld it was farfetched
[5:45:39] BlewGamingGroup: i doubt it . i dont think they want to bring a new class out til it is as close to 100% done as possible
[5:45:47] DoubleNova: what is the playstyle for evoker most similaar too
[5:45:51] paravak: They're the class needs the most test and feedback I would imagine, being entirely new
[5:45:52] goriath87: Maybe you can only ride your dragon
[5:45:55] Dinermoe: 20man evoker mythic first raid testing Kappa

[5:46:16] ZakuzaGB: evoker dps just seems like ranged demon hunter haha

[5:46:22] WayneG947: Just like launch then KAppa
[5:46:34] Dinermoe: it sounded like theyre "done" so far with evoker
[5:46:38] xotankkk: will evoker be available on pre patch?
[5:46:39] Akermay: I'd imagine Evoker is easiest for them to balance too, no past baggage
[5:46:40] Dinermoe: like atleast ready to test
[5:46:46] WayneG947: 10 million evokers, couple dozen other classes LUL
[5:46:47] RastaTeddyGram: where would i find the mod's he uses for wow? for the bindings and such
[5:46:56] Fnchentai: is evoker a race exclusive
[5:47:02] KAHVITEK: Exciting times as a wow enjoyer
[5:47:12] ShadoodHD: well that definitely means evoker's going to be in alpha
[5:47:18] AerialAce94: but there are so many tanks, we dont need more of them....
[5:47:21] FrozenShades: Evoker will be available pre-patch? 😮

[5:54:23] Screamnsteam: didnt preach say he was done with WoW LUL
[5:54:23] Vaken_: Its justified Criticism I feel like, but negativity do better then positivity on youtube, so maybe its because of that too

[5:55:52] zenkodac: best part is when FF fans argue with other FF fans in a toxic way about FF community not being toxic
[5:55:53] NieIas: imo asmon just played ff because he got 100k+ viewers last year and now he gets 40k max so its not worth it

[6:06:59] Nevindaz: KEKW
[6:07:00] TheItalianStallion321: he must have been crucified

[6:07:58] AerialAce94: wow story gets datamined months before it ever releases
[6:07:58] School_Toilets: For me the perfect mix of gameplay and story telling is swtor. FF is mostly cinematic and dialogues and you do nothing when it occurs
[6:07:58] ZakuzaGB: i wish WoW had more side story stuff in the zones
[6:08:02] Nevindaz: rlly now I care a bit or more..

[6:08:32] restlesstornado_1: @Towelliee what do you think about the FFXIV story?
[6:08:35] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they put him on pike and send him back to wow lmao XD
[6:08:38] Eregbueye: if you tell a Wow player that the story is shit, they would be like "hell yea brother"
[6:08:47] Nokterian: its not just offensive its downplaying the game that people know and love for ffxiv
[6:08:52] Broomba: After that he doubled down for 3 days
[6:08:53] ShadoodHD: bfa ended the wow story Pepehand
[6:08:56] Bogzeh: the community ingame tho... LUL
[6:08:59] Gr3atAp3: we're more interested in your opinions on alcohol than wow thats why

[6:09:04] Nevindaz: yep
[6:09:04] Zivs: YEP
[6:09:10] Stonefather: It's hard to make WoW players angry at you. Unless you mention Titanforging Keepo

[6:09:51] School_Toilets: Watching a mundane farm in wow is my shit, idk why but it's fun to watch when you also do chores in wow yourself
[6:09:52] a_valentine_story: wow has inherit down time so its only natyural theyd play something in between patches and expansions
[6:09:55] Sollice: The problem with FF community is they want everyone to play the game so it's popular, but then they dont want any outsiders playing the game :P
[6:09:55] Nevindaz: a few dramas
[6:09:58] WayneG947: the WoW community are like, we are too old for this shit haha
[6:10:03] zenkodac: some do but it's such a small minority that gets mocked that it almost instantly disappears
[6:10:04] Dystilled: Everquest, but lets not talk about the complexity of that story
[6:10:07] NickLeonhearth: Ducksauce is a great example, back streaming wow after 8 years
[6:10:08] ShadoodHD: every community loves to complain, hell everyone including me likes to complain
[6:10:17] jamarky23: alot of mentally ill people play ff14 hence the fanatism
[6:10:18] Bogzeh: half of twitch returns to wow on a new expac
[6:10:22] TheItalianStallion321: @Sollice and i feel like they want people to play their way, only 1 way or you are wrong
[6:10:22] Nokterian: LUL
[6:10:31] Klutar: baj plays whatever these days too
[6:10:36] Zivs: We've been expecting you towSip towSip
[6:10:36] ZakuzaGB: when someone leaves for FF is like your dad going to the shops and not coming back

[6:10:42] Klutar: most people play wow on and off too, so that helps
[6:10:43] Nokterian: yeah i noticed in his chat people where very happy to see him playing WoW again
[6:10:47] healthypoison458: and people will carry him too
[6:10:50] Miklagart: the thing is players/viewers also sometimes leave for couple of months or even years and then come back
[6:11:19] WayneG947: @jamarky23 That's just MMO players in general you'll find
[6:11:20] Broomba: @nickleonhearth he had to reset his body and mind on everything plus his wife started to play again and he got onboard plus he started a new toon different concept
[6:11:27] Triist0ne: The FF social bubble burst when asmon went to it and they're still picking up the pieces
[6:11:30] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  he said he'll check alpha tho
[6:11:32] jamarky23: thats gonna be funny, hes gonna be banning a shit ton
[6:11:34] bowsers1: when Asmon talk  or plays WOW ,  there are lot of negative people
[6:11:39] NieIas: they were shitting on wow ofcourse they are ff andies
[6:11:47] Bogzeh: smart KEKW
[6:11:52] Nevindaz: and also what I didnt like was the animocity and hate of some well known FF andies that they didt ever tryed wow but they still trash talk bout wow..
[6:11:56] TheItalianStallion321: last thing ill say before i go food shopping. yes, i go food shopping at 7:30am EST. anyway, i was told a few years ago to NOT tell people i skip cutscenes or ill be kicked out of the guild lmao

[6:12:38] RPClipsGTA: does the mount have a low drop rate? i remember getting it when the raid was new and thought nothing of it
