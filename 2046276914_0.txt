[1:18:56] Lussyisbabby: I was distracted for most of that fight. My grandmother's nurse called. I'm back now.
[1:19:42] xXSiebzehnXx: Is it the live aspect to the community in those other games?
[1:20:07] Baladore: Is the issue that single player games, you can't share with friends?
[1:20:26] Baladore: Ohh interesting.
[1:20:52] Skoonta: I have a hard time starting the  game, once i start im usually happy i did
[1:21:11] Baladore: I get that with timed games.
[1:21:15] Reckless135i: ff7 intergrade was hard to play again after ff16 because how good the combat was in 16, I hope rebirth is more high paced like 16
[1:21:28] Zarpoc: anxiety
[1:21:32] xXSiebzehnXx: Makes sense
[1:22:08] PaganFlute: i think we r so used to multiplayer games these days with a repeating and endless collecting and progression, that a single player game, no matter how good the story ends and after it, part of the progression feels kinda for nothing cuz it ends anyways. xD Kinda for me the feeling
[1:22:55] xXSiebzehnXx: We went from playing games 2d for fun and now we‚Äôre in 3D worlds trying not to die against everything
[1:23:08] Chaos_Elixir: For me I can blow through resident evil all day, but get more anxiety in wow raids :D
