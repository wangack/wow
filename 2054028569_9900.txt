[8:06:57] shlajfer: how much exp will bfd give?
[8:07:53] shlajfer: oh nothing said at all?
[8:07:55] Upcomin: datamines say bfd gives 23k xp ONLY BOSSES, we dont know trash xp
[8:07:55] shlajfer: that is pretty hype
[8:08:34] Gwent: the bfd 20 something k is based on datamine ye
[8:08:47] shlajfer: bro if trash gives exp, we already know what will happen
[8:08:54] Upcomin: only read it in warri discord
[8:08:56] Gwent: but it's 2 different ones
[8:08:57] vlagori: BFD has shitloads of trash
[8:09:07] 21up21: im just gonna raid log bfd to 40

[8:10:03] NeXT_Re: 10 min? damn

[8:11:39] taffga: you just start the ID with a new alt char
[8:12:06] shlajfer: do u guys have any insane plan btw?
[8:12:19] shlajfer: or just dungeon blast
[8:12:50] shlajfer: i assume a lot of ppl will do that
[8:13:06] 21up21: you've got that dig run rat quest. maybe that'll be enough
[8:13:08] Upcomin: we were planning on turning in quests first and doing bfd after
[8:13:09] shlajfer: tell them they are nerds
[8:13:11] Upcomin: shouldnt make a diff right?
[8:13:13] Stivil: what was the final verdict on enshrouded btw?
[8:13:17] shlajfer: and tell them u have dig rats for years
[8:13:33] vlagori: Are you trying to get world first or just first reset?
[8:13:33] idm_beistet: is blacksmithing gonna improve at 40? felt like a scam at lvl 25
[8:13:57] Upcomin: aaah i see
[8:13:58] Upcomin: youre right
[8:14:04] 21up21: @idm_beistet you get to make a cool scuba diving helmet at 40
[8:15:32] Upcomin: Upcomin subscribed with Prime. 
[8:15:32] idm_beistet: @21up21 is it at least a good scuba diving helmet?
[8:15:57] Qristoffer: time for engineering p2
[8:15:59] taffga: Yes it keeps you dry @idm_beistet
[8:16:14] idm_beistet: nice thats all i need
[8:17:17] idm_beistet: what?
[8:17:22] Upcomin: KEKW
[8:17:24] 2foxy4you: 20%
[8:17:28] 2foxy4you: but u get 50 all res
[8:17:29] idm_beistet: 60% ??
[8:17:42] idm_beistet: that sounds horrible
[8:18:03] 21up21: dont need to move if you already in the right spot
[8:18:03] idm_beistet: can u negative it with a fap?
[8:18:08] idm_beistet: negate
[8:18:12] flenbober: KEKL that would be dumb
[8:18:15] flenbober: @idm_beistet
[8:18:19] flenbober: who knows
[8:18:27] idm_beistet: its not like they havent done dumb shit before
[8:19:02] espiliuxx: tank item
[8:19:03] 21up21: movement speed reduced by 20%? did they change it?
[8:19:30] idm_beistet: if u can pop a fap and negate it then its fine right?
[8:19:34] stimpack_01: be strong vs rets
[8:19:35] Farmers1: maybe you can prefap the slow
[8:19:41] flenbober: imagine how crazy it would be if it could be fapd / freedom'd
[8:19:45] flenbober: haha
[8:19:45] Qristoffer: hard argument to win it seems
[8:19:50] spy_bones: fap might make you immune to the buff tho
[8:19:54] taffga: Theres ur argument, FAP makes the onuse better
[8:19:56] idm_beistet: ye maybe
[8:19:56] flenbober: ah ye true
[8:20:04] Weliel: i mean BFD gear was generous with hit %
[8:20:24] Weliel: i feel like gnomeregon gonna be same ?
[8:20:54] Qristoffer: make one :)
[8:21:08] idm_beistet: the slow sounds horrible tho
[8:21:10] espiliuxx: BS bis for humans?
[8:21:23] alexjmartens: if bleeds arent usable does that make fury the play
[8:21:28] flenbober: heyheyheyeyheyo HeyGuys

[8:21:59] 21up21: should have offered him a dig rat
[8:23:54] flenbober: wasnt it 6?
[8:24:00] flenbober: isant*
[8:25:22] flenbober: ah its rank 5 nvm
[8:27:01] Spoofy91: 54 crates think im done
[8:27:35] zenuk95: what are you farming
[8:27:36] Grymaa: LUL
[8:27:55] jes994: Then play BG3
[8:27:59] taffga: You hyped about the 5man rolling round STV?
[8:28:05] 21up21: @Spoofy91 go for 60 at least
[8:28:26] ekio___: I have 21 warrior , any suggestions for fastest leveling? I don’t think I will get bfd in time
[8:28:26] taffga: Ah fuck off i want to be hyped was hopeing for some good arguments
[8:28:54] pontapotter: SM grind ApuGuitar
[8:29:05] 21up21: easter egg hunt for adults
[8:30:11] Syphe12: Poor Baly has been memed for during entire Wrath for his cloth farming
[8:30:13] Syphe12: Poor guy
[8:30:28] Gwent: not even curious about stv?
[8:30:44] Syphe12: Yes
[8:31:37] Gwent: for me anything that isnt the other way around doesnt make sense
[8:32:16] Xinergy: I mean you literally made pvp videos for years moo :p
[8:32:17] spenstig_: arena grand master trinket
[8:32:33] Xinergy: feels weird to hear you say you don't play the game for the pvp ngl
[8:33:08] Xinergy: yeah I can understand that
[8:33:16] 21up21: life is just killing rats and collecting boxes now
[8:33:39] xiuhx: But now were all just addicted to min maxing and parsing
[8:33:42] Gwent: i mean there are people that just queue warsong, pvp is more dynamic
[8:34:05] Xinergy: And it's not just you, I did a /who connect yday and it had 21 people online and only 1 in bg :p
[8:34:10] Gwent: plenty of p server guys that do that for 20 years now soon
[8:34:25] flenbober: KEKL
[8:34:38] king_tedward: i mean who wants to pvp in sod anyway lol no reason to
[8:34:49] Gwent: same goes for pve no?
[8:34:50] cjsteez123: next mn pvp vid?
[8:35:00] flenbober: the nelf hunters ganking with eye of beast while shadowmelded KEKW
[8:35:17] king_tedward: humane male rets trying out div storm like
[8:35:26] king_tedward: 'holy shit this is epic'
[8:35:32] Gwent: what moves you towards bfd when you've played a lot?
[8:35:33] Gwent: wtf
[8:36:15] Xinergy: Idk if it's just us getting older. I also think gaming as a whole changed. Dopamine everywhere. People no longer play a game without grinding out some kind of reward
[8:36:32] Gwent: but see theres people that are the same in wsg
[8:36:39] Gwent: even on your server, yolam, etc
[8:37:13] Xinergy: When I was young I would play some shooter game every single day for years, no competitive ranked etc lol
[8:37:20] Gwent: like i dont see how it makes sense after all the time to do the easier, less dynamic thing
[8:37:22] cjsteez123: lol nice
[8:37:22] Xinergy: idk how i did it now
[8:37:30] Gwent: unless you completely pump hot air into it with warcraft logs
[8:38:02] Gwent: all the arguments you make can be made the other way around
[8:38:06] Gwent: yeah
[8:38:09] king_tedward: well classes dont even have most of their abilities so that affects pvp
[8:38:43] taylor13xd: true af
[8:38:49] Gwent: yeah, because you have to 5man to make it fun :D
[8:38:53] The_Longcat: why do dwarf males rune like they about to shit
[8:38:54] Xinergy: get the addon DropTheCheapestThing, thank me later
[8:38:56] The_Longcat: run*
[8:39:00] chargebotsolo: I did a few ABs in classic for fun, pugs vs pugs were good
[8:39:13] Gwent: but you also have to blow up a construct to make bfd a challenge, is what i mean
[8:39:41] spenstig_: what arent you doing bfd because the raid is so amazingly fun
[8:39:56] Gwent: also gear, i mean you have to make a bunch of alts to even have a reason
[8:40:13] xPraddaG: We do a lot of 8-9 man BFD when we don't feel like pugging. Mostly if there's an alt that needs trinket or some shit.
[8:40:54] JJnotokay: what u farming moo
[8:42:03] fandrox: Still on the box farm
[8:42:05] fandrox: pepeHands
[8:42:23] Farmers1: i coudlnt figure out what he was trying to say
[8:42:50] tsefly3: think it was pvp is challenging, pve is not so why do you pve
[8:43:34] king_tedward: i get what u mean though its like i cant enjoy ganking some 400hp mage running down ashenvale its jst zz
[8:44:16] king_tedward: icc forever kek
[8:44:20] chargebotsolo: looooooooooooool
[8:44:21] fandrox: Vujke KEKW
[8:44:21] dereondra: the only apm increase from wow is legit starcraft, nothing scratches the itch like 3v3
[8:44:29] Gwent: i was mostly saying your reasoning for completely cutting out pvp dont make sense, because all these reasons can be made for pve
[8:45:04] Gwent: its mostly a game that is done pretty quickly and then you either play with friends, socially or create a challenge artificially
[8:45:13] Gwent: i just asked
[8:45:26] dereondra: other games dont offer as many variables to juggle in a timely manner as wow does with a like 2 exceptions
[8:46:52] dereondra: true, no ranked system to incentivize you atm you get no gain for the skillful effort
[8:47:04] 21up21: why are you colelcting unconscious rats?
[8:47:46] Gwent: stv not yielding anything worthwhile?
[8:48:13] king_tedward: stv will prob be the same like u go get ur loot or rep then repeat
[8:49:02] Gwent: but you make a bunch of alts mate
[8:49:17] king_tedward: cas there is no further progression
[8:49:17] dereondra: @king_tedward you think they should incentivize open world pvp more too? some ranking you get from open world only and there could be player tiers to go for higher yield
[8:49:33] dereondra: that way killing a shitter isnt worth anything
[8:50:12] king_tedward: @dereondra i saw jokerd today doing some escort quest and there was like 5 drus rying to kill it while their raid was healing it and it looked so cool so anything that gets ppl out more like that maybe idk
[8:50:28] Gwent: it's just funny, not trying to piss you off, but you hate it and create reasons to play
[8:51:13] Gwent: i guess i agree with everything you say but care more for finding niches i can stand instead of finding gear slots to fill
[8:51:26] dereondra: @king_tedward yea exactly, the semantics are another thing but getting people out and interacting not around events should be the dev's aim for pvp imo
[8:53:05] uglyandfat666: what is this crates
[8:53:44] gamedemon010: just watched video of scotty who interviewed 2 blizz dev they confirmed 6 new runes per class
[8:53:52] gamedemon010: do this mean we get the head slot aswell then
[8:54:12] spenstig_: no
[8:54:15] spenstig_: we're getting boots + waist
[8:54:43] Selveniam: Are you stacking waylaids to get insta xp at release? thats fucking big brain
[8:54:57] spenstig_: the waylaids only gives 200 xp though
[8:55:09] Syphe12: 51?
[8:55:13] st_st_: for rep isnt it
[8:55:35] Selveniam: theyll give more xp next phase
[8:55:58] 21up21: you have 300 gold
[8:55:59] spenstig_: not those crates
[8:56:02] spenstig_: @Selveniam
[8:56:17] 21up21: yeah you can
[8:56:17] Selveniam: oh so its only for rep?T
[8:56:33] spenstig_: I dont know what he is collecting for, but I assume the lower "level" ones only gives 200 xp
[8:57:39] spenstig_: nobody truly knows tho
[8:58:40] 21up21: @SpenstigTV i just hope they give something tbh.  even if it's just 1xp per box
[8:58:49] 21up21: i don't want mn to be disappoint
[8:59:22] spenstig_: will probably be datamined tomorrow
[9:00:15] spenstig_: if it gives shitloads of exp you'll see panic farming the next few days
[9:00:31] Gwent: im still going to be mad, having no expectations is for zen monks or something
[9:00:43] Gwent: it'll at least give 30s back, im already coping
[9:01:03] Busdieker: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740

[9:03:35] Busdieker: oh well i'll be rooting for perp
[9:03:43] Gwent: the machinima style video tho
[9:03:53] spenstig_: i'd be more inclined to see asmon clean his house
[9:05:10] Clown_Astrid: that last 25 one where the players were free cheating and a few of the players quit due to it taking forever to start was pretty good KEKW
