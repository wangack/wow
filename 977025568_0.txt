[1:52:37] Catspaw66: toxic is technomancer . OP class
[1:52:52] Echoslayer: i think this set is more of a support set, so you would sacrifice your damage more to get the most out of it, applying more debuffs etc,, using the mod that when you get below 30% halves your CD's

[2:09:59] Echoslayer: yeah you would go with extend duration and 2s per kill for golem the rest would be damage on your other abilities, thats just for a slam build though i've not tried bleed yet
[2:10:12] yokai_5: i wish pistols were stronger in this game , would love to see some builds for them
[2:10:32] Kromede: mamaaaa uuuWWWuuu KEKW

[2:14:31] Echoslayer: no he needs to keep golem since he has set, but yes without set ditch golem
[2:16:28] kakefisk: Dose damage on devestator scale down on later levels. At start you kinda owned everything easy. But, later on it kinda feels like its slowed down alot?
