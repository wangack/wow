[1:07:15] TSMballer: Sad that twitch is stewing all of their 1-4K Andy’s with this bullshit, don’t blame you just venting

[1:10:26] sainnt757: Twitch wants all the money for themselves
[1:10:26] MrGattz: it costs them to many pennies
[1:10:26] durindur: 0 bits
[1:10:27] tr4ncetv: @Towelliee Lets go for hard Clan boss today! I'm 2 keys in
[1:10:27] hipposmasher: BEZOS is hoarding the bits

[1:10:45] LSBreed: getting to 50 is fun. after though is a slog to do anything worthwhile
[1:10:45] spleen1015: Bits for ads option is still there for me.
[1:10:48] DallTV_: the best way to lvl now?
[1:10:50] jerexify: @Towelliee They didn't remove it. You can watch an ad for 5 bits. But it's on top of any ads you or Twitch already play.
[1:10:51] Takobaited: Bits > Get Bits > Watch Ad
[1:10:58] MissFlux: Favorite Diablo music playing <3 <3
[1:10:58] FF3LockeZ: Yeah, you can still get bits for watching ads. I literally just did it 30 seconds ago @falldrgn

[1:12:09] Riddlz: pally question towel if you are prot and stand in consicrate do you take less dmg?
[1:12:10] FF3LockeZ: It chooses random days to sometimes let you watch ads for bits or not, depending on your activity and other factors @falldrgn But you can see the button is still there and grayed out even on days you can't, so clearly it's possible sometimes

[1:17:48] TheCliffyShow: After I get Dark Athel tomorrow night, I might uninstall the game for a bit. To much temptation to spend money and I need to save it for PC upgrades. Thank god I don't live near a casino.
[1:17:48] propoopimus: you only need 1 core for wow Kappa

[1:20:41] captain_steve_rogers: its the GPU issue
[1:20:41] Jac_MacK: why are you taking my questions like an attack?
[1:20:42] MILESkg21: might depend on bitrate
[1:20:43] Punkmau5: @towelliee Have you tried leveling through dungeons. It's really fast than questing.
[1:21:05] kalmenus1: Obs is probably not using all cores
[1:21:06] spleen1015: Dungeons are not faster than questing
[1:21:09] SmokedHog: no, nvidia has their own encoder
[1:21:09] MILESkg21: why are you assuming he only plays wow
[1:21:16] Jac_MacK: I am just going off what u said ... geez man chill
[1:21:24] studshift: @Towelliee where do you start cata questing as Horde/

[1:23:03] griffdog125: @mekoa2z the real question is. Did you look and sniff after it happened lol
[1:23:05] FF3LockeZ: It's all about the experience, not the time. Gotta take in the ambience and story, let the pacing slow down, stop and drink, ask if people are ready for pulls
[1:23:13] GriffGoodman: if you have recruit a freind you get 50% extra xp, its insane

[1:24:13] LemonDrizzleCakes: If you do Ready for War achievement does it unlock mag'har orc and dark Iron dwarf?
[1:24:14] MILESkg21: yep
[1:24:17] spankymcpie: long walks in wow are the opposite of nice long walks irl, nice long walks in wow give you double chins

[1:24:42] Zhiril: I don't think that argument that old zones are designed for ground mounts really hold water. There's never been expansion where you could fly when it was released unless max level.
[1:24:44] Wcvechten: Try vault of the wardens, second boss
[1:24:45] TouchMyCream: stratholme is overtuned as fuck

[1:25:28] mia__leeloo: small indie company
[1:25:53] spankymcpie: theres some dungeons where your pet on takes 2-3 damage per hit as a level 45+
[1:26:12] RogueBear: some of the fights you legit cant finish. the damage scaling is literally broken to the point of one shot on some encounters
[1:26:19] xVel: Does it taste like him?
[1:26:29] AudioKat: LUL ^
[1:26:34] hummmmble: What is p50? You're leveling 50 chars?

[2:35:10] CipansR_Ayaya: yeah I thought pc plays agaisnt consoles
[2:35:13] rillo5: Pc performance is so much better it’s night and day. Maybe with new consoles it will be different but for now pc is much better
[2:35:24] rillo5: For cod
[2:35:39] Motivess: if it's anything like the modern day COD campaigns I wouldn't be surprised if it only took 5 hours
[2:35:51] Motivess: other*

[2:37:19] mrpresbaby: not this year
[2:37:23] mrpresbaby: pros are playing PC
[2:37:31] caitlolz: cus the game is always poorly optimized on pc
[2:37:37] Motivess: smart @mrpresbaby
[2:37:37] rillo5: Only PlayStation can turn off crossplay I think
[2:37:54] mrpresbaby: @Motivess yeah better support on PC
[2:37:54] Weemancod: although there still are hackers here and there it has gotten much better this cod than the last one on PC. Game is still going strong on PC
[2:37:58] 3dRes: I found that when playing on PC the lobbies are always full of console players, and probably only a few PC plaayers
[2:38:07] spankymcpie: Keyboard and mouse is always just gonna be better for fps games
[2:38:14] Armdel: i still see plenty of PC only lobbies on MW

[2:39:46] bobbyinhd: @Towelliee any worth while rewards from the carnival this time around?

[2:40:38] Craetos_: transmogs in event are copies of loot from Icecrown dungeons tho :( :D @Towelliee

[2:40:52] SageToads: How bad to you think the que will be on illdan for launch?
[2:40:57] Motivess: updated textures
[2:41:02] Craetos_: @Towelliee totally the same
[2:41:08] rillo5: The aim assist is strong for sure. But any shooter on controller needs some aim assist really. Go turn off aim assist on shooters and see how hard it really is to aim with thumbsticks
[2:41:13] mrpresbaby: @Towelliee info about preloading cold war https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1324049638354153472?s=20

[2:42:07] jeneraljelly: @sinlesssinner is that like heroic heroic raid equivalent to last raid in SL?
[2:42:26] sinlesssinner: @jeneraljelly you mean BFA? nah, its pretty low

[2:44:14] simodh: yep :(
[2:44:16] Kromede: pretty sure jeneraljelly
[2:44:21] moejimbo: they already got rid of corruption
[2:44:24] jeneraljelly: RIP super anti fun
[2:44:26] Frankenclyde: @jeneraljelly anything gotten now or prepatch will be replaced withing 20 quests of shadowlands so just getting something that makes it not a struggle is all you need.
[2:44:28] Prevention6: i wish i had microcenter near me all i have is best buy which is terrible for pc parts
[2:44:34] Motivess: isn't there 42 slots for mats @craetos_

[3:08:51] 11RYN: @propwash80 Yeah. It shows you which quests to pick up, where to go to do them, kill elites for x loot. But I believe it's not quite optimized for speed as for completion of the area / storyline
[3:09:01] Apokolipz: lol
[3:09:08] MizixTV: Pretty sure Rainbow Sherbet is one of the flavors thats supposed to come in my starter pack!
[3:09:10] Frankenclyde: @Towelliee i mix the rainbow sherbert with high protein soy milk for first thing in the morning. its great
[3:09:11] Powerofwar_1: @motivess i will do that with this one. i just went through the BFA campaign with my first one.

[3:18:14] Drakenking: @Jarlan23 @TheRiwen I mean people put hundreds of hours into it just in the beta alone
[3:18:30] Frankenclyde: @Towelliee you do have an acutal heal :D
[3:18:42] Drakenking: The point is, as with any roguelike, is to try and experiment with new builds every time you run through
[3:18:44] TheRiwen: @Drakenking maybe i got bored after 1 run
[3:18:54] OtterChiefs: tdub!
[3:19:08] Drakenking: Ok, you don't like roguelikes then. Do your weekly run and let others have fun
