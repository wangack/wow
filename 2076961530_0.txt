[9:54:34] edi_the_don: So toxic positivity is oposite of toxicity
[9:54:46] pokeypointy: theres more layers to it
[9:54:48] masterxd69: is this the slowrun strim?
[9:54:53] edi_the_don: but that is positive

[9:55:17] snapatterson: 10 eggs Yepge
[9:55:18] Creoxx: order food
[9:55:21] edi_the_don: Toxic positivity is a negative attitude towards negative emotions12. It is the obsession with positive thinking1that minimizes and denies any trace of human emotions that aren't strictly happy or positive2. Toxic positivity can silence negative emotions, demean grief, and make people feel under pressure to pretend to be happy1even when they are facing difficult or tragic experiences.
[9:55:38] cs094: Prefoxquestion aren't eggs bad for you eggsdd
