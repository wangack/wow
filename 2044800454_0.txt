[4:34:15] frozoneee: How the hell can you SPAM spellsteal and go UP in mana xD what
[4:34:58] chinchin23: why do classes even have mana at this point
[4:35:07] smoothkeyz4: lol
[4:35:16] dooshken: dps classes with mana use it for heals

[4:38:12] dooshken: it has no mana cost or just it's low?
[4:38:17] dooshken: didnt know about that
[4:38:35] Cocoapuffs1: its the mana regen on arcane thats insane
[4:38:44] Cocoapuffs1: it cost a lot but they got a lot of regen
[4:38:56] Stoichulk: Clepto is a long cast, otherwise it does cost a lot of mana but they regen it
[4:39:07] whyusername: doesnt arcane have more mana then the other specs?
[4:39:09] Zartirian: U rather fight SL fire mage with triune, or DF Arcane?
[4:39:25] Cocoapuffs1: it does cost mana because it procs clearcasting
[4:39:33] Pkbrunben: frost is like 3-4, arcane is like 12-15 times :P
[4:39:39] Cocoapuffs1: you have to use mana to get clearcasting
[4:39:43] dooshken: I just looked on a low lvl mage I have and it does cost mana but it's way less. Maybe there's a talent that removes mana cost too
[4:40:06] Pkbrunben: maaybe 15-20 max
[4:40:13] Cocoapuffs1: you can literally spam forever
[4:40:24] Pkbrunben: but u regen fast

[4:59:20] therealnaki: When can i expect blizzcon merch and another win. my CDEW blizzcon win hoodie is such a flex @cdewx
[4:59:36] Deatherage15: if druid couldnt stealth drink their mana would be a big problem
[5:00:50] ashmodean1234: but mana usage is also part of the equation no? not just mana regen
