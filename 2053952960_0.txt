[0:03:59] FoxiekittenWoW: he casted so many flash heals
[0:04:01] nickfr0stt: i was in a lobby 2.5mmr with a guy playing idol of nzoth
[0:04:22] Vilaye: ye the wizzler plays a really weird spec, but they make it work
[0:04:33] nickfr0stt: i doubt it
[0:04:33] Vilaye: but i feel like they would lose to the melee cleaves that are being played in EU
[0:04:45] halbinder: yeah he did, when he runs or has no instants
[0:04:53] nickfr0stt: benevolence seems awful
[0:04:54] nickfr0stt: or?

[0:07:17] Cvarks: bro apparently kubzy got the same ping issue in the game he played
[0:07:31] agatonsaxs: dont think it does any relevant dmg tho, just as a filler sometimes
[0:07:41] Aalty: Despairge
[0:07:48] halbinder: its a filler exactly
[0:07:50] Cvarks: ya so un4ch
[0:08:02] keijunahi: Despairge @aalty

[0:10:48] halbinder: power word life consumes too much mana and gets worse with damp
[0:10:56] lucksyzz: ur pressing shield on cd pretty much
[0:10:58] Cvarks: every sp just copy wiz
[0:11:03] kishoengi: benevolence is biggest bait
[0:11:43] Ambiantzz: md?
[0:11:48] halbinder: mindgames is not worth it imo
[0:11:52] kishoengi: mental agility or bulwark

[0:16:36] Aalty: I was laughing watching whaazz say how the hooligan cant get punished for trinketting and if any of u trinket its autoloss and im sitting there like "this is exactly how everyone has felt facing rmp for last 2 expansions+"
[0:16:37] Aalty: KEKW

[0:17:30] Reeceboss: yoo g

[0:17:54] Kenzosxx: maybe rmp is good against that?
[0:17:57] Reeceboss: yeah that was so weird, i expected the ww to go down so fast
[0:18:20] welaxoxo: think frost mage would be good vs that?
[0:18:42] FoxiekittenWoW: tjak?
[0:18:56] tipmax1: Jayti?
[0:19:15] kishoengi: scrubx
[0:19:36] Reeceboss: LMAO

[0:20:05] Reeceboss: so strange
[0:20:09] Pajcsi: idk when AWC was so fun to watch last time like this weekend
[0:20:14] Reeceboss: maybe lontar needs to bust out  ultrabull into this comp tho
[0:20:16] Reeceboss: like
[0:20:18] Pajcsi: hope those teams will keep up with
[0:20:20] Reeceboss: assa/destro/hpala

[0:36:35] komplexrules: what build you play for most of your games as sp?
[0:36:41] komplexrules: sp is real pain in shuffle impossible to play
[0:36:44] komplexrules: at lower rating
[0:37:53] kebablover55555: can you kill link as fast as wixz?
[0:38:24] torkija: play 4 set, take deathspeaker, spam SWD on cooldown and oneshot people with 300 k SW pains

[0:41:30] Joke_Fistweaver: @torkija is that viable or heavily nerfed in pvp?
[0:41:33] mollyclive: does it make sence to learn arcane now after years on frost/fire? looks like i just do nothing in comparsion with non meta specs
[0:41:37] kebablover55555: poor ret
[0:42:24] golfallstardk: Imagine ret being in full ranged send lobby 😂😂
[0:42:52] psychic241: how do u think mage lock would do into ww rogue?
[0:43:06] Yelan: Bro get a reagents bag wtf monkaS

[0:43:24] BesharTv: show build for solo
[0:43:39] AsdOfc: venruki was freaking out cause u didnt go mld was a bit weird
[0:43:47] willythenewb: what about mage rogue
[0:44:00] torkija: @Joke_Fistweaver did u wantch awc yesterday? Wizk had 200k+ crits
[0:44:15] inclemens: need ret vs that team
[0:44:25] torkija: its the only reason why SP does the most dam atm
[0:44:53] AsdOfc: should just gone sub
[0:45:25] Mozaiczny: I need recomendation for caster that have a variaty of good comps to play. I played melee last 10 years :D
[0:45:34] tarifa123456: what do you think of Whaazz saying the monk was playing yolo with defensives?
[0:45:39] archtme: whaazz has sub in his blood, he will own quickly
[0:46:01] sind233: @torkija its 0.5 multiplier in pvp so you kinda need to line it with DA+ trinket proc+sophic for it to do that much dmg
[0:46:33] mollyclive: does it make sence to learn arcane now after years on frost/fire? looks like i just do nothing in comparsion with frost or fire
[0:47:11] beifengs_student1: ye monk had 34m dmg rogue 14m lol
[0:47:16] beifengs_student1: he did dmg for both of them lol
[0:47:20] man0litos: @raikubest whats your opinion on blizzard releasing a big patch 2 weeks before AWC. in other games this doenst happen
[0:47:24] archtme: It just looked like outlaw couldn't damage them, sub has much more on-demand burst, but I have no clue about anything
[0:47:28] archtme: in general
[0:47:31] archtme: :)
[0:47:42] ckbrah: @archtme lmfao
[0:47:54] komplexrules: how is your gameplay as shadow when you get trained ind shuffle?
[0:48:02] inclemens: ret/war/x should beat that team i think, maybe i wrong but i think this is the best comp to beat ww sub
[0:48:02] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[0:48:15] ServeyTTV: ret warr stomps ww sub btw :D
[0:48:17] khorgam: lontar did great job with resto
[0:48:26] Storm3n1: how is ret /war atm, feels like no1 is playing it
[0:48:47] torkija: @sind233 ye but if u combine it with catharsis it can do 300k+ easy
[0:48:49] ckbrah: @Raikubest can u try talk about ur thoughts when positioning on SP? maybe easier in the actual games but just curious on when u push, when u drag back etc
[0:49:00] everlastingsummerw: why wasn't lontar hexing the dps more ? i litteraly didn't understand
[0:49:01] torkija: try on a dummy, see whats ur top dps spell. suddenly it's fkn SWP
[0:49:10] kevinsorbo1337: how would you rank holy/disc as healer? still f tier?
[0:49:11] VirixTV: VirixTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months!

[0:49:22] de_dude: sounds great
[0:49:51] plebcake_: my twin plays DH/combat rogue. does Spriest fit with both of those in 3s? or?
[0:49:52] sind233: @torkija ofc
[0:49:58] torkija: @kevinsorbo1337 holy S+, disc F lol. why would u write it like "holy/disc" like it's the same spec
[0:50:10] ckbrah: @plebcake_ yes bro, both are good
[0:50:24] yodaaxx: raiku unlucky in the tourny bro maybe next time you guys will take it! but that WW dmg insane also @Raikubest
[0:51:02] mikgullll: !awc
[0:51:03] sind233: @torkija How is holy S+? Cause its not
[0:51:13] mikgullll: Who won AWC
[0:51:13] kevinsorbo1337: sound like you broke 1
[0:51:16] ckbrah: @Raikubest can u try talk about ur thoughts when positioning on SP? maybe easier in the actual games but just curious on when u push, when u drag back etc
[0:51:30] yodaaxx: venruki also suggested that if you guys played DEMO + frost mage against that ww comp you guys wouldve prolly taken the W @Raikubest
[0:51:35] sind233: @torkija Just beacause Jayti won it? Then SP is also s+?
[0:51:39] torkija: @sind233 last patch made it S+
[0:51:43] lilpulsing: @Raikubest just got here, sorry if you've already discussed it but wouldn't MLPala be a good comp vs that ww sub team? Or same problems apply cus they can't die for a long time?
[0:51:50] torkija: when rdru got nerfed
[0:51:56] kevinsorbo1337: @torkija just wanted both ranked, of course its not the some. where are the brains here
[0:52:08] OptiTV_: ez win next week with war mage mw/hpal
[0:52:18] sind233: @torkija Its A at best
[0:52:32] torkija: @kevinsorbo1337 you asked are they both F tier lol, even though hpriest won yesterday and got mega buffed last week
[0:52:56] kevinsorbo1337: @torkija only cause holy works ini 1 comb it doesnt mean its good...
[0:53:05] torkija: @sind233 y prolly u are right, but then which healer is S right now? not a single one i guess
[0:53:16] sind233: @torkija Shaman?
[0:53:27] Justflux: Seen Wizk juicer mindspikes and brought out the sp aye
[0:53:52] torkija: @sind233 idk maybe but then again it is not that strong vs hpriest
[0:53:57] ckbrah: @Raikubest can u try talk about ur thoughts when positioning on SP? maybe easier in the actual games but just curious on when u push, when u drag back etc
[0:54:20] lilpulsing: Check my msg above pls :D @Raikubest
[0:54:39] ckbrah: ah well fk me then :D cus yea its so hard, sometimes making plays is the worst u can do cus u get stuck and flop
[0:54:52] notMyk: feel like there is only one sp that rly makes it happen
[0:54:53] lilpulsing: Or the shaman on the enemy team knocks u into root into static. This is how u get repositioned.
[0:54:54] notMyk: its walterwhite
[0:54:55] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Raiku
[0:54:58] Justflux: Wizk tends to play sort of like a healer, never too far from pillar
[0:55:10] yodaaxx: do you think that if you guys played DEMO + frost mage against that ww comp in AWC you guys wouldve taken the W @Raikubest
[0:55:13] lilpulsing: @notMyk yep me u're right.
[0:55:27] lilpulsing: oh him too
[0:55:34] ckbrah: @notMyk Walterwhite literally said yesterday "if theres a chance i get ccd i wont ever go for cc" and he just stands back and does damage, so no, he doesnt :D
[0:55:42] everlastingsummerw: There's gonna be another cup like this one next week ? i'd like to see how teams adapt vs this WW Sub
[0:55:44] Hogstabber: is rogue/mage your fav comps
[0:55:45] Hogstabber: ?
[0:55:46] notMyk: whaazzTOXIC whaazzTOXIC whaazzTOXIC
[0:55:50] Karanze: Would RMD have lost to WW+sub?
[0:55:51] lilpulsing: @everlastingsummerw my thoughts exactly
[0:56:07] lilpulsing: Better pump than get bash cloned. Mostly
[0:56:08] eHej: hey raiku
[0:56:14] everlastingsummerw: ok cool !
[0:56:20] lilpulsing: but if you can get cc for say your warlock on his coils that's more important too.
[0:56:23] aremyys: I think people will adapt and hoolibang gone have hard time cup 2
[0:56:24] Justflux: people can personal stream them or?
[0:56:25] Badanka87: wish they streamed the quali
[0:56:32] sind233: Any chance of some SP gameplay on wed/sunday? @Raikubest
[0:56:57] lilpulsing: Might be time to bust out the rps @Raikubest :D Nah but NA meta wouldn't work on EU
[0:57:06] Justflux: I saw the Echo chamber, you called the cheesy comp was scary
[0:57:17] Karanze: Whaazz on warr and then some defensive comp, surely that'd best em'
[0:57:48] ckbrah: sub/sp/rsham you can kill jayti easy on goes
[0:58:05] Deathmarkedx: @ckbrah sp does 0 burst my g lol
[0:58:12] Gingtko: @Karanze ye but i think u need some class to do big dmg on go's too
[0:58:13] ckbrah: @Deathmarkedx  are u joking? ;D
[0:58:13] lilpulsing: @Deathmarkedx not true
[0:58:23] everlastingsummerw: i don't think warrior would be an answer to that WW / Sub @Karanze ( could be wrong =
[0:58:23] ckbrah: sp does like 80% hp in 1 global
[0:58:27] aremyys: tbh I had allot fun watching holing games, this meta is boring at least we had some fun
[0:58:29] Karanze: @gingtko Thundercleave?
[0:58:41] Deathmarkedx: yes true yall delulu af if u think sp does burst like ure hitting a dummy in arena.
[0:58:44] AsdOfc: what about vs dex? comp diff or?
[0:58:45] lilpulsing: @ckbrah maybe I wouldn't go so far but it an definitely pump 50% hp y
[0:59:02] lilpulsing: Yes friend just go in and wing it! You guys almost had it
[0:59:05] Karanze: @everlastingsummerw Surely warr can solo peel their goes
[0:59:05] doubletwink: Hi champ
[0:59:07] everlastingsummerw: i'm 99% sure whaaz will sub mirror howton , there's no way he doesn't
[0:59:12] dreamawayx: @ckbrah can you show your check pvp please?
[0:59:19] lilpulsing: I saw that on last game chanimal forgot to reposition port so maybe u guys still had it. But hard to make 0 mistakes
[0:59:25] yodaaxx: any 3s practice tonight ?
[0:59:27] ckbrah: @dreamawayx  legdaygodx-ravencrest
[0:59:56] Gingtko: @Karanze idk maybe sub rogue instead of outlaw, or some dmg spam comp, cuz i think they were good defensively the problem was to kill them, maybe something to dont let hpriest play too not sure
[1:00:10] doubletwink: @aremyys hello there bud
[1:00:15] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Raiku and enter code: ECHO

[1:01:34] Karanze: @gingtko Batman cleave, sub+arms. Make it happen B)
[1:01:50] everlastingsummerw: @trimaz__ PokPikachu
[1:02:20] beifengs_student1: @shredder1111 imagine crusader in the corner coaching screaming LUL
[1:03:08] everlastingsummerw: i cannot wait to see crusader attempt number2 at AWC with LFG
[1:03:19] maybethistimepls: sucks when u guys get rekt by the NA teams u will just blame lag kinda lame
[1:03:22] ckbrah: ya its the positioning issue again :D so hard
[1:03:31] everlastingsummerw: @maybethistimepls ok buddy :D
[1:03:31] tarifa123456: @raikubest how do you decide when to trinket vs healer saves you with cds in shuffle?
[1:04:23] pazta9: if i even have 100 ping its literally unplayable
[1:04:28] pazta9: like 200 is just insane
[1:05:03] Deathmarkedx: big diff Kappa

[1:09:32] nickfr0stt: shadow priest really nice spec
[1:10:23] suchskillmuchimpress: fun game :D
[1:11:15] batu_x96: from what i see its just random cc and random dmg which is winning the rounds in shuffle most of the time pretty boring

[3:06:09] Cvarks: not many mages clip there missiles anyway
[3:06:21] Loadedmvp: i mean last game we could see it on whaazz a bit before camera cut :D
[3:06:33] Cvarks: 90% of mages do tbc dam
[3:06:47] Cvarks: yeah its very nice when u clip
[3:06:53] rdubm: you should never fake with 140 ms Kappa
[3:06:55] MaximusTVlive: what was the hardest part of the games last night
[3:07:03] Lucons1: was it the trinket he failed?
[3:07:06] Cvarks: i tested it a fuck load, gained damage doing it outside of magi lost magi damage doing it inside of it

[3:07:38] asdkl2312k3o: from my PoV watchin awc stream, whaaz was greedy never pre'd anything but I guess lontar is calling defs
[3:07:38] Mitchaay: was resto shaman maybe not the play?
[3:07:39] Lucons1: kinda tasteless
[3:07:51] Cvarks: well in the window in general not just the explosion
[3:07:55] aframpp: nah lontar played insane on sham
[3:07:57] oscrtv: do u think its because u guys dont have synergi with lontar yet or was it just old man gameplay?
[3:08:04] Cvarks: if ur echo clipping isnt worth
[3:08:07] Cvarks: w/o echo i think it is
[3:08:30] stepkoudny: eredar a god
[3:08:39] buffmagespls: face them alot on ladder but they werent that giga high (2,5kish)
[3:08:46] WagwanBombaClatBomba: every dance from rog someone dropped 100 to 10

[3:09:21] hackerxwalla: howtons  fkn insane at sub its crazy
[3:09:32] aframpp: eradas was doing 100k+ dps outside of cds WW is stupid when it can stay in
[3:09:33] flennx: @Raikubest i'm curious - why did you guys stick to the same comp against them
[3:09:37] madaros365: jayti was the real hero

[3:09:48] FANmeander: whats your guys plan now? new comp next time?
[3:09:53] madaros365: plays a fkin holy priest at awc and wins it
[3:09:56] rdubm: eradas 0.1 trinkets first stuns xD
[3:09:58] Cvarks: whats the situation that made u think clipping was bad? were u echo or nah
[3:09:59] eX1stnZ_: Howton mains hooligan tho for couple of expansion, he's the specialist of this comp and Jayti was really crazy insane on the games too he trained a lot on his priest
[3:10:01] asdkl2312k3o: naah

[3:10:17] eX1stnZ_: It's like the thing is everyone was playing meta comps reroll fotm except your team and howton
[3:10:18] DipdabTwitch: Felt like Jayti was getting a lot of double and triple fears which was making things even worse
[3:10:23] oscrtv: cant a rmp kill ww's in like 2 goes?
[3:10:50] Ceribi: ww is outlaw levels of unkillable tbh
[3:11:37] asdkl2312k3o: to beat that comp u prolly need ret/warr or something
[3:11:37] Ceribi: and sub rogue is also immortal
[3:11:48] rdubm: deadge
[3:11:52] asdkl2312k3o: u need to kill them in a stun and be able to cleave trade with ww
[3:12:14] lotslol: getting dongered

[3:24:04] WagwanBombaClatBomba: viewers went full record bananas
[3:24:06] asdkl2312k3o: all different comps
[3:24:11] torkija: whaazz should play more boomie
[3:24:13] asdkl2312k3o: not mirror every game
[3:24:55] asdkl2312k3o: I think its kinda sad Mehh took the break, cuz this would be the best of challenges for him
[3:25:41] asdkl2312k3o: but ppl complain about healing is too much, but I swear ppl play the most damp comps. No dmg outside of goes
[3:25:45] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i think if whaazz played warr instead outcome would be diff
[3:25:49] asdkl2312k3o: as soon as u play a cleave u cant live for long
[3:25:58] sarent02: i agree
[3:26:00] Atte0825: who is the one in your team, who stressed out the most during games?
[3:26:05] yoogyrdru: @ raiku would mld lose into dh war?
[3:27:05] oscrtv: I think demo/frost mld vs hooligan would be god
[3:27:11] oscrtv: good*
[3:27:20] asdkl2312k3o: if hpriest cant go oom, why cant hpriest heal rm in TR?

[3:28:16] asdkl2312k3o: hpriest healing in damp seems really high too
[3:28:27] Stigez: @asdkl2312k3o it really aint
[3:28:39] Stigez: hpriest is the only healer that realies on raw healing and nothing else so damp hurts the most
[3:28:48] sarent02: if u wana win as frost lock u gotta win the first game
[3:28:55] WagwanBombaClatBomba: frost demo, and complete aids def win on dampen
[3:28:57] Reidz: @Stigez evo
[3:29:03] WagwanBombaClatBomba: play *
[3:29:40] Stigez: @Reidz well evo has cds that stop or delay damage too making it much easier to deal with even in high damp
[3:29:47] Stigez: but mostly yeah
[3:30:10] Atte0825: ww dmg was insane
[3:30:14] Cheggle: holy in damp is a game of waiting till angel form
[3:30:18] Atte0825: burst dmg*
[3:30:32] Stigez: @Cheggle and then watch your flash heals do 20k and hp just drops anyway xd
[3:30:34] sarent02: i dont understand why the ww wasnt orc

[3:30:56] sarent02: no he was human
[3:31:01] yoogyrdru: issue is with ww sub, usually pally is good into but since they can play on mana pala isnt that good anymore xD
[3:31:10] asdkl2312k3o: how about destro/spriest KEKW
[3:31:10] oscrtv: @sarent02 no it was orc

[3:39:44] Stigez: @SirBeaverTeeth well we will see if they somehow make it back from this but lontari s no mehh for sure
[3:40:08] raven1103: The reason I was rooting so hard for u this time, more than  previously was I wanted u to get the winning interview and tell them to fix mmr
[3:40:17] aframpp: what do you think about all the hate lontar is getting?
[3:40:21] asdkl2312k3o: I think u lsoe vs nexts team if next can get drinks

[3:41:08] Wynterscold: Low damage live long comp
[3:41:20] Chrizirl: lontar has some big ass shoes to fill so ofc ppl are hating on him
[3:41:24] raven1103: @Bashy_89 cause he is the easiest "target" to blame cause he is the newest
[3:41:24] madstepz: what comp do you wish you played if you could go back ?
[3:41:25] b77ar: lontar is not an issue
[3:41:25] asdkl2312k3o: are u going to try fire/destro? 3x rift with combust
[3:41:30] Cheggle: @Bashy_89 he was always going to iff then dont win it all as its 'imagine if it was mehh'
