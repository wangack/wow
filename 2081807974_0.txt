[4:22:51] Jkorn415: We have been clearing since second reset, when we grab pugs we grab whatever we can get, alot of times it has rogues. We may lose world buffs to something silly but still end up clearing, people take the comps way too seriously like you said
[4:22:51] XCD_XCD_XCD: we like to parse KEKWait
[4:22:59] TheEventGuy: if lil bro had a quiz-show it would be called Yap-pardy yap
[4:23:04] pureagony420: I just like the 20% run speed for leveling.      it’s nice but makes normal running suck tho

[4:27:19] HappysFunPalace: @urmadlife great feedback
[4:27:19] Demobalderes: @JokerdTV there are things people will like and things people won't like. A way to solve this issue is guilds, there are casual guilds that don't give a fuck and guilds that try hard. Just find a guild that fits you ReallyNice
[4:27:21] irvinwow: They should make a Sharpening stone that give WF but slightly less good
[4:27:23] rhaziaa: Hi Bob

[4:28:07] LightBladeStream: The people who lie about being 6/6 are toxic aswell
[4:28:08] irvinwow: @JokerdTV  they should make a Sharpening stone that give WF but slightly less good
[4:28:09] ShadowCrimson: @JokerdTV the game would be 200x better if buffs became raid wide, fuck any classic psychopath who likes group buffs
[4:28:09] MisguidedPingu: horde have spirit of alpha buff from shamans on tanks
