[5:40:34] lord_konstantine: Wracking pain literally one-shots at high keys, they made it uninterruptable for some reason. You either have a personal or you die
[5:40:35] eyxx: the spiders should expire after like 45 or 60 seconds
[5:40:35] Edeslash: last bosses in keys should be easier compared to the later ones. but the early bosses can be intense as fuck

[5:40:43] eyxx: they're just so aids if you don't have an immune
[5:40:54] Edeslash: there are some amazing difficulty curves in dungeons where the last boss is just a burn against the timer, not some kind of insane survivability check
[5:41:16] niko_is_bad: yazma has 1-shot check like every 40s
[5:41:58] niko_is_bad: soulrend is 1-shot, wracking pain is 1-shot and then every spider is 1 shot and nobody knows how to move the boss

[7:08:05] malenko_b: @emidotexe was surprised to see a wintersday gift from you lot when i logged ine earlier! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
[7:08:05] emidotexe: NO PLEASE
[7:08:06] Laranity: Hiiii Teapot! late night patch notes whaaaaat
[7:08:24] emidotexe: ????????
[7:08:25] Edeslash: chat became so much more friendly and constructive when we switched from wow to gw2 BRUH the toxicity and passive aggressive flame is suddenly gone
[7:08:29] emidotexe: PUTRID ABOMINATION WHAT
[7:08:59] Violetawa_: thats savage... but probably not wrong xD
[7:09:02] Edeslash: @Laranity let's not talk about how he spent 5 hours progressing an easy boss and didn't get the kill...
[7:09:03] niko_is_bad: Haha mirage
[7:09:12] eyxx: mirage in 2024 OMEGALUL
[7:09:14] emidotexe: yeaa i think the changes are way too heavy handed. i have a lot of thoughts on it, but my hope is that anet will pull back on the nerfs
[7:09:17] eyxx: RIPBOZO
[7:09:26] emidotexe: i expected nerfs, but this is way over the top. they essentially nerfed the same thing in 3 different ways
[7:09:47] eyxx: why are they nerfing combos
[7:09:50] eyxx: that's so lame
[7:09:58] emidotexe: i also hate that they're not doing the iterative balance cycle and kinda dumping all of the changes at the same time. i completely agree it was overperforming on bench and on some fights, but you would expect smaller nerfs as the dust settles
[7:10:01] focus1h: i mean confusion wasnt that good anyway
[7:10:02] emidotexe: and not just all at the same time
[7:10:16] Zarkinox: a dead dog
[7:10:37] eyxx: this is why i prefer smaller balance changes at a time rolled out over a longer period
[7:10:45] emidotexe: like instead of nerfing the duration from the clones, from the ambush, AND the condition duration from the regen trait, why not introduce one of the nerfs at a time... take some time to see the numbers, and then nerf more as neccessary
[7:10:46] eyxx: like dota 2 does most of the time
[7:10:48] DCBeer: fuck you chaos virt
[7:10:54] spacecatprincess: thats way too many nerfs all at once wow
[7:10:55] emidotexe: this is just swinging the pendulum from one side completely to the other :(
[7:11:44] emidotexe: the heal chrono stuff is interesting, i expect it to feel and play roughly the same, but mantra spamming is much weaker now
[7:11:58] DCBeer: shocker they're nerfing the competition and buffing things that play nicely with the "new" weapons coming next drop
[7:11:58] emidotexe: but i do like the more consistent healing source
[7:12:33] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!

[7:13:28] eyxx: they hate staxe

[7:20:09] Kmasings: axe ambush
[7:20:13] emidotexe: power untamed also uses devourer now i believe

[7:31:40] DCBeer: explain to me why they nerfed hammer ele autos and other skills instead of reverting the flame wheel buff @MightyTeapot
[7:32:24] spacecatprincess: so what you're saying is that they should nerf one wolf pack and buff soulbeast's sustained dps to compensate so the average player performs better :)

[7:44:58] staszekskieta: sorry just tuned in, why exactly is gw2 community miserable? like a year ago i feel like ive read the same thing about wow
[7:45:04] Easterblade: do you play gw2 off stream? cause if not, it sounds like you're just not enjoying the game
[7:45:15] nao_ir: it is a shame. I left gw2 years ago and came back recently and the game is actually quite fun, but people seem to be stuck in a meat grinder.
[7:45:44] sixane: Personally i wish they would introduce hardcore mode to GW2 to appeal to the more hardcore/higher difficulty fanbase, so much of
[7:45:50] maplelost: thats the problem with yearly expacs: not enough time to innovate, just pump out same shit.
[7:45:53] sethmalicious: let‚Äôs be honest the LFG is bad
[7:45:56] sixane: so much easy content - CM raids are kinda a joke
[7:45:58] vrotmnekrot: wow is the same shit it's been 3-4 years ago, same ol m+ and raids, running the same treadmill every patch
[7:46:00] eyxx: @staszekskieta everyone with the same mindset is either apathetic or mad because they don't want to feel apathetic
[7:46:03] ShadowLaink: doesnt help when people are only playing the same thing so it stops feeling fresh, makes it hard to find things fun imo

[7:46:30] spacecatprincess: hammer the miserable ppl and find the happy ones Gladge
[7:46:31] Edeslash: Yeah it's wild to think how far wow has come, and even while there was so much good in BFA and SL, it feels like the design philosophy of blizz has completely shifted and the game is in such a healthier place. It's possible.
[7:46:31] maplelost: The best thing you can do to enjoy the game is ignore the community GG
[7:46:34] sethmalicious: gw2 needs artifact grinds
[7:46:36] Tadorian: Tbh, stop streaming the game. Stream more WoW, bcs that way ppl are way more happy.
[7:46:49] darkmoon26: this is where i think you are wrong, gw2 community are not another seperate human species, they are the same people probably also playing wow and having fun , playing other game, but gw2 MAKES people miserable. The game is a GEM but it feels like anet is abandoning it.   Cheap feel expension, reuse asset, 1 fractal every 5 years, thats why people are miserable.  WOW gets big ass huge and nice expension regularty. of course you have fun.
[7:46:49] Edeslash: or at least it was possible in wow's case
[7:46:50] focus1h: gw2 is in a palliative state

[7:48:17] spruudel: ü§ù ü•ö
[7:48:17] darkmoon26: wow is very different, you can feel the quality of the content when it release, you know where the money went.  GW2 release soto and you wonder where all the gem purshase went....

[7:48:36] JozzeTv: gw2 doesn't make people miserable. people are doomers and wish the game to be what it isn't and become miserable. people just need to go into the acceptance phase
[7:48:40] Fades1209: its actually not what I was implying but ok bud
[7:48:45] Edeslash: i've played wow since 2007 and i've mythic raided every tier since 2017. WoW currently is fresher than ever because of the systemic changes in DF (rotating dungeon pool, talents etc.)
[7:49:07] staszekskieta: my impression with gw2 community has 95% of the time been positive, to the point where i was bragging about it to my friends that play other online games. ive even have some outside guild host a traning raids for me and couple other randoms when i was getting started.
[7:49:15] niko_is_bad: Acceptance phase is a scam and just a miserable hole

[7:51:19] Debaros: I mean I am relatively happy and I have 17k hours
[7:51:19] lnfernyx: so peoiple who basically dont play the actual content of the game
[7:51:22] Debaros: but I have taken breaks
[7:51:23] kransarka: guys he dont go from hidden gem like gw2 to be wow tard he just sees money in wow streaming limit maximum corrupted him
[7:51:31] Spinerek: Aware
[7:51:34] Debaros: Though I may be an anomaly
[7:51:38] eyxx: OMEGALUL
[7:51:49] Edeslash: HOLY
[7:51:52] eyxx: hidden gem
[7:51:53] Tadorian: The thing is, that when you bought SoTo you thought is going to be big (atleast for me) but, the soto story is so blank and im saying to myself like its this that bad..? Waiting for episodes which feels like Living seasons..
[7:51:54] Debaros: Fair enough
[7:52:04] Byrchi: guys he dont go from hidden gem like gw2 to be wow tard he just sees money in wow streaming limit maximum corrupted him
[7:52:06] GirlPainting: This game gave me thousands of hours of entertainment over 11 years
[7:52:13] ViviLouF: HOLY
[7:52:14] reptilesexist: gw2 is for dads with 8 kids
[7:52:17] vrotmnekrot: Well i just hope you find what you're looking for in WoW and what you couldn't find in GW2
[7:52:46] azraeel_95: the game is good but content is dead... you know how upset i was with the amount of content we got last update
[7:52:49] darkmoon26: teapot do you think people dont despice the game but how the company manage the game. thats why people are so miserable.  seeing the game you love so much getting abandonned and feeling like its not the focus of anet/ncsoft anymore
[7:52:59] DCBeer: why hold back, fuck the gw2 community
[7:53:05] focus1h: I feel like I always enjoyed playing different games and tbh for a hardcore player the worst thing u can do is not taking longer breaks from it
[7:53:14] kransarka: gw2 outdated and nothing to make you excited people dont wanna play game with no future  4 month small patch
[7:53:23] Xelim27: if GW2 isn't going to change.. isn;t time for gw3? either that or they.. i don't even know lol
[7:53:27] vrotmnekrot: @focus1h people in GW2 are very friendly and helpful, not something you'll see in WoW
[7:53:43] eyxx: @darkmoon26 company vs game doesn't matter when they're used practically interchangeable in the discussions
[7:53:45] focus1h: well, I think thats wrong vrotmnekrot
[7:53:50] eyxx: interchangeably*
[7:53:51] Edeslash: @vrotmnekrot extremely untrue
[7:53:52] 2DensTV: What about the game makes people miserable?
[7:53:54] GirlPainting: what exactly?...i just switched in
[7:54:02] focus1h: Ive played both games and u find friendly ppl anywhere
[7:54:08] NotYetRatedd: everytime i log into wow i get instant hate whispers, unfriendly bunch
[7:54:10] guillejhin: peepoChess
[7:54:33] MightyTeaBot: Buy Guild Wars 2 today and support the stream using this referral link bit.ly/TpotGW2 or play for free here: bit.ly/TeapotGW2ForFree
[7:54:38] Splurtlol: I feel like gw2 isn't too comparable to wow anymore, from an MMO perspective, it's hard to argue for gw2 as a 'main' game like wow can easily be, it's probably got like 10% of wow's dev team, gets infinitely more content and is a game you can see yourself playing constantly pretty easy
[7:54:43] eyxx: you know those addons gw2 players hate so much? those are made by the community
[7:54:47] eyxx: to you know, help players
[7:54:47] reptilesexist: no, you have vivi carrying you
[7:54:58] kransarka: gw2 pvp not toxic, ppl complain about afks and bots..
[7:55:04] 2DensTV: I‚Äôve played the game at all levels for like 15 yearsand it is not that wholesome.
[7:55:08] vrotmnekrot: guess our experiences differ by a lot, i came from WoW to GW2, unlike you, i could see the stark difference in mentality
[7:55:12] Xelim27: I wouldn't say that's not the case for everyone but I'll deff say it's a streamer thing. WoW is very toxic  some times lol
[7:55:16] MrCrypt: streamer says everybody so nice .. casual player will say smthing different
[7:55:19] GirlPainting: GW2 is not toxic....we are venemous! thank you very much ^^ ;-P
[7:55:20] DCBeer: its substantial
[7:55:27] DCBeer: they blast
[7:55:31] focus1h: wow story is amazing too
[7:55:33] focus1h: the lore etc
[7:55:40] focus1h: the quality is insane
[7:55:43] TeachMeClarity: I feel like you still just spamm m+
[7:55:50] Debaros: I tried to get into WoW but all the wow vets I knew were like "EWW" and they dont want to play it anymore LUL
[7:55:55] Debaros: so i got stuck
[7:55:56] darkmoon26: not gonna like im miserable and jealous of the content wow and ffxiv gets
[7:55:59] Edeslash: i mean we don't get a new raid for like 8-9 months and we are ANGRY Grrr Grrr Grrr
[7:56:00] vrotmnekrot: WoW story became complete dog shit when the ystarted fuckin around with time lines
[7:56:00] eyxx: they should just go back to the rule of cool
[7:56:10] Xelim27: ffxiv story king. wow is carried by metzen's warcraft universe
[7:56:11] guillejhin: ratGASM
[7:56:27] Edeslash: how dare you make us play some old content for a few months before the new expac Grrr Grrr Grrr
[7:56:27] eyxx: "and then the giga warcrime orc went back in time to do more warcrimes with his dad from an alternate universe"
[7:56:29] Splurtlol: how did it feel thinking that you might actually not clear content in time, came down to the wire with sark
[7:56:33] focus1h: yeah DF wasnt great but overall I love wow lore
[7:56:38] Byrchi: Grrr Grrr Grrr
[7:56:50] kransarka: how canu take gw2 story seriously when all characters talk on radio 1000 miles apart and there is never reason for them to meet in world, feels so cheap
[7:57:05] DCBeer: it motivates people to improve
[7:57:09] DCBeer: its great
[7:57:23] NotYetRatedd: infinite goals
[7:57:25] ShadowLaink: Killing raids just before enrage especially on first clears feels really rewarding compared to blowing them out of the water 1-2 mins before enrage
[7:57:26] eyxx: we loosed toots
[7:57:30] NiftyGuile: Challenging endgame instanced group content is just not this game's lane, a part of the community has clung to the idea that one day it will be as substantive as raids/mythic in wow or ff14 but it has never even been close to those so that part of the playerbase is just miserable all the time. If you just like casual grinds and stuff like wve/big metas and fashion wars it's a fun time though.
[7:57:32] guillejhin: peepoBlushComfy
[7:57:38] Edeslash: are we loosing game
[7:58:09] DCBeer: who are you playing against in MDI first round?
[7:58:13] dranet11: xddTree
[7:58:26] PHOENIXf20: @NiftyGuile no game is focused on hardcore endgame content but they still release it for people who enjoy and its appreciated
[7:58:35] mastern40: the fact that they nerf mythic bosses after theyve already been cleared bothers me for some reason
[7:58:39] nyclix: Hi Teapot. Any thoughts on the wvw restructuring beta? Are you interested in getting involved? Love the stream btw
[7:58:42] TeachMeClarity: Raiding in WoW is unmatched. PvP well flat, open world as well. And for a time, m+ spamming was the way to get raid gear
[7:58:44] spacecatprincess: SOTO DISCUSSION TIME???
[7:58:45] reptilesexist: idk why you are harsh on gw2, but they actually have very hard content, for example the kitchen game in crystal desert, many people quit the game bc of that mini game in pof
[7:58:47] Edeslash: ALOO hello sir ALOO it's me taimi ALOO please pick up ALOO i am terminally ill btw ALOO
[7:58:54] guillejhin: we need new competitive content in gw2 like m+
[7:59:00] ciraxa: i skipped every cutscene Aware
[7:59:07] spriggan2323: idk why you are harsh on gw2, but they actually have very hard content, for example the kitchen game in crystal desert, many people quit the game bc of that mini game in pof
[7:59:10] guillejhin: FeelsWeakMan
[7:59:20] Rennorb: gem bad Smadging gib w8
[7:59:22] NiftyGuile: @PHOENIXf20 and they have released it. Just like I said it's not really a lane or pillar of this game like it is for some other games
[7:59:25] eyxx: literally the only big platform to actually do analytical reviews of the story was WP's channel
[7:59:29] eyxx: and he's too busy now
[7:59:34] Tadorian: Let's talk about balance - Anet shouldn't balance around golem dps. And actually look where there is problem and balance around it. @mightyteapot
[7:59:39] vrotmnekrot: man i miss WP
[7:59:51] spacecatprincess: @MightyTeapot have you considered banning the toxic chatters
[7:59:55] PHOENIXf20: @PHOENIXf20 not really cms in gw2 are a joke honestly compared to anything in other games, also the time in between them not enough
[8:00:00] guillejhin: peepoChess imNOTcrying
[8:00:15] DCBeer: call it how you see it
[8:00:22] spruudel: I'm ramping
[8:00:27] SomeGuyNamed: @MightyTeapot thoughts on the Astral ward members often being members of "evil" organizations in tyria? Hmm
[8:00:28] alinoix: I would like to hear you talking about it
[8:00:32] atroo57: Balance is irrelevant, everything is overtuned

[8:00:48] DCBeer: just start over on the grind
[8:00:54] eyxx: gw2 is holding their cooldowns for the next intermission
[8:00:54] DCBeer: new channel, all wow, all pump
[8:01:07] spriggan2323: NAILS
[8:01:08] spacecatprincess: banning toxic chatters is how you cultivate a better community and draw in less toxic ppl (or at the very least make the goobers behave)
[8:01:12] ikari77: OG soo won was peak engagement
[8:01:44] sixane: i really cant get past the movement/comabt in wow compared to gw2, for some reason gw2 feels so much more fluid to me, otherwise id invest time into wow instead
[8:01:45] reptilesexist: man i started a league of legend game, got hooked up in the heated argument , now im banned lol
[8:01:50] dranet11: do you think you would ever kill their original versions tho
[8:01:58] ciraxa: they¬¥re pumping out nice gemstore and BL skins recently, their quarterly report will be looking good
[8:02:06] NiftyGuile: teapot do you play retail or classic wow mainly ?
[8:02:21] redcobra_II: ???
[8:02:32] spriggan2323: @reptilesexist was bot lane inting or what happend?
[8:02:36] dmjason_official: lol at the shit show that is NA prime WvW reset lololol
[8:02:38] guillejhin: Ratting Igotmyeyesonyou
[8:02:58] Edeslash: It's very weird. Blizzard has never been this aggressive with nerfs.
[8:03:00] Debaros: i literally tried the hand thing and I hate it make it stop
[8:03:05] redcobra_II: got 6k hours on wow, 12k on gw2, gw2 combat and controls are much better, i thought this was common knowledge doesnt mean wow is a worse game
[8:03:05] Edeslash: Suddenly every hard boss has to be made significantly easier after 200 guilds have done it. Feels like Tindral loses its identity entirely next week.
[8:03:15] ciraxa: Aware vod review
[8:03:16] nyclix: Queues in wvw  eb 42 red 35 blue 30 green 68. Least it won't feel dead lol!
[8:03:16] eyxx: it's so fucking wack lol
[8:03:25] reptilesexist: @spriggan2323 no loading screen was long , i decided to listen a bit before the game start, but i forgot about the game
[8:03:26] eyxx: the moment top 200 have done it
[8:03:27] focus1h: in gw2 having 1s of quickness every 2s doesnt feel that fluid actually Aware
[8:03:32] eyxx: they fucking obliterate the boss
[8:03:40] spacecatprincess: this is why i never played more than 2 classes in gw2 Clueless
[8:03:45] nao_ir: 100%.
[8:03:47] guillejhin: VS depresso BRUHHING
[8:03:50] Edeslash: i did vod review for the first time ever now on tindral prog with twitch. It was an extremely valuable experience.
[8:04:04] kransarka: @Edeslash because its a business decision. people lost interest in the game they bait people to come back and pay for the game just like with dungeon nerf in m+ in season 2
[8:04:06] DCBeer: getting better at GW2 made me better at Destiny 2 even though I played D2 much more before playing GW2
[8:04:14] DCBeer: LUL
[8:04:15] NotYetRatedd: VOD review Gladge
[8:04:24] ciraxa: every professional player does it
[8:04:33] Edeslash: @kransarka mythic raiding is niche content. it's not a marketing strategy. People who reach mythic tindral are already EXTREMELY invested in the game
[8:04:40] ViviLouF: Snizzle vod review NAILS
[8:04:40] Larewt: My issue with WoW is that It normally feels like there's nothing to do alone that feels like it matters to me personally. The group content is solid though but sometimes I want to chill progress something alone
[8:05:03] eyxx: i still do HTCM basically out of habit weekly and wow has made it feel so fucking payphone OMEGALUL
[8:05:07] Edeslash: @Larewt with dragonflight they've been a bit better with this. the game gets new solo player content every 1-2 months
[8:05:40] guillejhin: gw2 ambient music is epic
[8:05:47] Larewt: @Larewt yeah but you can normally finish that solo content within a day and then become timegated by something.
[8:05:47] ciraxa: @Larewt they¬¥re adding dungeons where npcs filll up any open roles automatically for example
[8:05:52] Debaros: its something you realise when you get someone who never plays video games to try a game. Things we take for granted as obvious - something as small as 'I' being the inventory button is NOT an organic thing and its something we are conditioned to do as gamers
[8:06:02] SomeGuyNamed: what
[8:06:03] sixane: i guess that was what im trying to say earlier - the combat is alot less actiony for me in wow
[8:06:07] guillejhin: peepoWew
[8:06:08] Reskar: And even in other kind of games. In shooters is actually very noticeable
[8:06:12] Byrchi: I love solo content in wow like Amirdrassil and aberrus
[8:06:25] focus1h: I would say that melee actually plays more fluid at times
[8:06:27] reptilesexist: @MightyTeapot please talk about scourge and herald concerns
[8:06:33] MightyTeaBot: doot doot
[8:06:34] focus1h: in wow
[8:06:36] AtuV_Hierophant: doot doot Û†ÄÄ
[8:06:36] MightyTeaBot: ATUV_HIEROPHANT IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
[8:06:50] reptilesexist: yep here it is
[8:06:58] spacecatprincess: take the alac willbender pill
[8:07:11] Debaros: i love being a melee tank will I get the gw2 experience?
[8:07:15] ciraxa: melee feels very similar to gw2 gameplay
[8:07:24] SomeGuyNamed: but can i press skills without a target? susCat
[8:07:36] Larewt: M+ as a melee feels rough imo. Gotta be on top of it or you can easily die to something random within a ton of mobs
[8:07:37] Nani_GW: tbh just being comfortable with pressing your buttons fast , makes you better than 95% of any gamer . so if you play a games likean  rts or moba or gw2 that require alot of button presses , you get better in every game
[8:08:02] NotYetRatedd: fel rushing into a frontal, dynamic borpaWICKED
[8:08:08] vrotmnekrot: yeah but you're talking about playing in a team not pugging, which most of m+ players do
[8:08:12] aetherlord4r: from my personal experience, mmos skillset transfer really well between each other, I was farming top 10 dps leadboard in ESO, came to GW2 last year, cleared HTcm easily, now Im playing New World for 3 weeks now, already started farming m3 dungeon sth like m+ in wow
[8:08:17] DCBeer: I miss unique class buffs
[8:08:24] DCBeer: in gw2
[8:08:27] dranet11: m+ pugs still do +27 keys
[8:08:32] sixane: Okay - i'll put some time into WoW then, what'd you suggest I play,because i know there's different versions of wow now?
[8:08:54] vrotmnekrot: 0.000001% of players pug +27
[8:08:55] eyxx: @sixane the wow we've been talking about here is dragonflight
[8:08:59] Debaros: Yes in terms of the feel of combat in WoW
[8:09:03] ciraxa: id say prot paladin feels a bit like HFB
[8:09:07] Debaros: Ah so like ff14? i play tank in ff14
[8:09:10] eyxx: classic plays out like a different game altogether
[8:09:12] vrotmnekrot: i have a better chance to drop chak infusion than meet someone who pugs a +27 in game
[8:09:12] dranet11: @vrotmnekrot you can say 0.00000001% of players do 27
[8:09:18] sixane: @eyxx is it the "main" version of the game? not the classic / all that spin offs?
[8:09:20] Edeslash: tindral and fyrakk are certainly great examples of bosses that require flawless coordination from 20 players, a lot of individual responsibilities in strategy and execution
[8:09:26] eyxx: @eyxx yeah
[8:09:32] kransarka: blizzard better give him affiliate link hes a good salesman
[8:09:35] sixane: okay, i'll check it out, cheers
[8:09:37] dranet11: sod > classic
[8:09:51] spacecatprincess: why would you put fish in a kettle. thats stupid
[8:09:59] maplelost: is it even fair to compare gw2 to wow
[8:10:36] DCBeer: I think you're the most objective person in the gw2 directory for what its worth
[8:10:54] spacecatprincess: wow without vertical progression would be sick
[8:10:56] ViviLouF: consoomer BatChesting
[8:11:00] Larewt: vertical progression is my least favorite part of WoW tbh.
[8:11:03] sixane: wait, have you tried Final Fantasy XIV?
[8:11:12] sixane: i've heard alot of people praise that too
[8:11:32] ciraxa: fungus
[8:11:40] kransarka: so how is flying in circles in gw2 for an hour + plz give review :D
[8:12:06] Nani_GW: and also there are more annoying gw2 players here than annoying WoW players , so the conversation gets more leaned toward criticizing gw2 since there are more  bad takes coming from the gw2 players
[8:12:08] darkmoon26: teapot, will you try Throne and liberty ? being a ncsoft game and having some similiraty with gw2 ??
[8:12:23] darkmoon26: hey why !? xD

[8:12:55] DCBeer: you'd have to no cam/no voice wow for a while to purify the waters
[8:13:01] TeachMeClarity: What I ended up with after years of playing both WoW and GW2 is that i play WoW for PVE and GW2 for PVP
[8:13:19] TeachMeClarity: And yeah, open world GW2 all the way
[8:13:21] eyxx: unfortunately if you're gonna be a critical content creator you're gonna attract critical people

[8:13:52] DCBeer: New World Sadge
[8:14:14] kransarka: too much afk and bots in gw2 make the game toxic, gw2 pvp ppl lose their cool beacuse arena net doesnt fix the bot problem... and people go afk after 1 fight in a match...
[8:14:27] Larewt: that feels like MMO pvp in general
[8:14:45] TeachMeClarity: Yeah, the competitive spirit is one, but i find WoW to be a lot more "who runs out of cooldowns" than GW2. Sort of a "resource menagament" style, whilst i find GW2 a lot more actiony
[8:14:46] DCBeer: apathy consumes :(
[8:14:48] vrotmnekrot: @kransarka you wanna talk about WoW and bots brother? Bots in GW2 don't impact nearly as much the economy as they do in WoW

[8:15:38] dranet11: noxxic is a well known website for being horse shit
[8:15:38] Awthornn: @MightyTeapot I would like anet to make old meta a bit more relevant, like idk more HP or cap on Dragon's Stand enboss
[8:15:42] Edeslash: ah, i love auric basin, but please teapot, Beware the thorns
[8:15:44] DCBeer: its probably just skill diff tbh
[8:15:48] Edeslash: The thorns seek your soul! ZojjaGa
[8:15:52] dranet11: @Edeslash teach them about noxxic
[8:15:53] ViviLouF: the website is rancid
[8:16:00] Grusomto_o: I stopped playing Gw2 shortly after it went f2p(not because it went f2p), checking in a few years later, the game feels soul-less, might be because no one in the guild had been on for 6 months or more, but the game just feels dated, movement and combat still great but it feels so dated imo
[8:16:09] ciraxa: @Larewt i think its largely because the modern mmo pvp modes are very self conained without any meaningful consequences for winning/losing (like losing accesss to a city or a great farming spot)

[8:24:48] Gorhaax: i dont think most of the community cares about the balance patches unless its something big in their face
[8:24:51] Grusomto_o: @kransarka The balance patch is aimed at those that are impacted, aka not the casual players? like i said earlier i dont play gw2 any more, but is this not how every balance patch work?
[8:24:52] Benjammn: nuance in gaming?  I never

[8:27:25] TriGreat: my biggest love in game is to spam emote xddtree
[8:27:35] Larewt: I wish you could raid in wow more often. Once I've done my raiding for the week I find myself struggling to find reasons to log in without having a vivid open world
[8:27:40] focus1h: ppl are overall just not very realistic with their expectation management in gw2 or in games in general

[8:29:14] Larewt: I normally go through stages of playing a lot of Gw2 when i'm tired of organized group content in WoW and return after to WoW when I miss it and am tired of not having enough in GW2. It's a cycle lol
[8:29:20] maplelost: GW2 community in acceptance phase already: the game is what it is.
[8:29:42] Dr3lll: Dr3lll subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! apathy is my credo
[8:29:44] theinoculator: So we‚Äôre not so much a community but just a bunch of miserable bastards LUL
[8:30:09] maplelost: soto destroyed our hopes and dreams
[8:30:20] Edeslash: @Larewt yeah i did a lot of this last year. I'm so engame pve focused in wow, I'm not even looking for that in gw2, i almost play it as a single player game
[8:30:29] CaosMarduk: @maplelost its so bad this way?

[8:31:02] Byrchi: Same I play wow as a singleplayer game. I like to get immersed in the dungeons so the companion dungeons are a huge thing for me.
[8:31:13] kransarka: u guys think soto is more like icebrood saga or living world
[8:31:19] JozzeTv: simps are annoying, doomers are annoying, apathy is corroding. acceptance is not apathy. you care up to a point, but pull back if it gets to intense. in the acceptance phase you still have hopes and care, but you don't go unhinged or just don't care at all. you put it in perspective
[8:31:32] aFlyingGuru: xddTree
[8:31:33] Grusomto_o: THIS, when i came back i think i lvl'd to 7 and uninstalled the game......
[8:31:34] ciraxa: Despairge
[8:31:34] Nani_GW: i view acceptance , as to not attach my happiness to the game  , not to have 0 expectations . I want the game to be better and i argue for it constantly , but if anet drops a bad patch i wont cry about it too much
[8:31:36] eyxx: "the game didn't look like it's worth my time" Chadge
[8:32:01] maplelost: what? isnt that guys job is to play WoW? what value would he find in other games LUL

[8:32:24] nao_ir: lol you
[8:32:36] eyxx: he streams variety between tiers
[8:32:38] Larewt: definitely depends on what perspective you are looking at the game with. Like casuals obviously don't require the same amount of investment that competitive or more serious gamers would
[8:32:42] TeachMeClarity: I feel like my friends that play WoW look at GW2 as trash and vice versa
[8:32:42] maplelost: that was just a fling
[8:32:48] eyxx: probably would be already if he wasn't enjoying DH in m+ so much atm
[8:32:49] Nani_GW: every game will drop shit patches , its just some people act like the end of the world when anet does
[8:32:50] TeachMeClarity: I'm not a huge fan of the mindset
[8:32:56] TeachMeClarity: But it is what it is
[8:32:58] nao_ir: think this is bad, but I used to play overwatch a lot. that‚Äôs a whole other level of acceptance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
[8:33:22] Edeslash: @TeachMeClarity all of my wow friends hate gw2 (they have never played it) xddTree
[8:33:45] ciraxa: Pog
[8:33:46] TeachMeClarity: @Edeslash Exactly!
[8:33:57] eyxx: i want sneb dota 2 streams

[8:34:02] TeachMeClarity: @Edeslash I got one dude to try it out, he got to like lvl 9
[8:34:03] Benjammn: noobstink
[8:34:05] 2DensTV: Sorry for the change of subject, but I‚Äôm going through season 2. I am just bad or are the Mordrem enemies WAY harder than anything else I‚Äôve encountered so far?
[8:34:07] Byrchi: When is teapot doing a league of legends stream? Its basically warcraft 3
[8:34:08] aFlyingGuru: i think they could maybe enjoy gw2 if they did a thing like preach and went in the game blind to clear the raids without any external help or information. but it would obviously just be like "a fun thing", not a long term engagement
[8:34:08] spacecatprincess: fun fact: i just helped a little baby core mesmer do the chak hp and it was a balst
[8:34:13] vrotmnekrot: @MightyTeapot what do you think about m+ keys going down a level when failing? Wouldn't it be better if they didn't deplete so you could learn and run the same dungeon over and over until you succeed instead of running lower keys that you don't need just to potentially do that dungeon again? Also would keep pugs together so they could try again instead of just leaving after one wipe.
[8:34:25] TeachMeClarity: @Edeslash And said "Meeh, i don't like"
[8:34:31] Benjammn: @2DensTV Yes, this is a relatively normal phenomenon
[8:34:36] Dr3lll: @MightyTeapot hyped for Stormgate?
[8:34:38] eyxx: nah keys not depleting would lead to incredibly degen gameplay at the high end
[8:34:44] 2DensTV: Okay thanks @benjammn
[8:34:44] eyxx: you'd literally play for perfect procs
[8:34:46] Benjammn: you'll get more powerful when you get your elite specs
[8:35:11] Benjammn: if you end up getting HoT/PoF I guess
[8:35:11] Edeslash: @Edeslash yeah some similar experiences and honestly when i personally started it took me a long time to find what i enjoy about gw2 and what's valuable to me about it
[8:35:18] Grusomto_o: I don't know who the guy you're talking with, but his giving me major Post Malone ''Hell yeah dude, that's great man vibes'' when u unlock some new shit ingame LUL
[8:35:21] focus1h: agreed
[8:35:26] focus1h: depleting is key
[8:35:38] Byrchi: KEYS
[8:35:41] aFlyingGuru: farming procs until you get lucky PepeLaugh
[8:35:54] eyxx: darkness didn't proc on enough players? reset dungeon
[8:36:09] ciraxa: its more problematic that you cant pick a specific dungeon key after timing it
[8:36:12] Edeslash: The truth is that pushing io score takes a lot of time and repetition and practise and there's no way around it. It is what the game is.
[8:36:30] Edeslash: You will deplete and you have to be ready to deplete without it getting too much in your emotions
[8:36:30] Larewt: I really like pushing higher keys but I dont enjoy repeating the same key level over and over
[8:36:33] MightyTeaBot: doot doot
[8:36:36] AtuV_Hierophant: doot doot
[8:36:36] MightyTeaBot: ATUV_HIEROPHANT IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
[8:37:27] Grusomto_o: Did the latest Gw2 expansion add something that was never in the game before?
[8:37:35] eyxx: imo they need to find a way to trick players into liking affixes
[8:37:37] eyxx: mindfuck them
[8:37:45] Larewt: what if you got a weekly number of no depletes?
[8:37:49] focus1h: @Grusomto_o relics
[8:37:56] eyxx: make them rewarding to do instead of punishing to not do
[8:38:00] TeachMeClarity: @Edeslash People tend to tunnel vision themselves into what's familiar. I think the biggest problem with having your friends try out GW is the horizontal progression. They are just so tuned into FOMO mindset and grinding till the "expiration date" that they cannot fathom a concept where that doesn't exist. You tell them "do whatever you want" and they get bugged out
[8:38:03] eyxx: even if it doesn't really matter in practice
[8:38:33] Larewt: I mean you'd still have the time lost. Some of those dungeons are long AF
[8:38:42] vrotmnekrot: you'd lose time, which is key
[8:38:53] Larewt: for sure for sure
[8:39:11] TheDervlin: you missed gw2 at all lately?
[8:39:17] ciraxa: and remove tryannical
[8:39:17] vrotmnekrot: depleting they key costs you more time, it's all about how much time you have to play
[8:39:20] Larewt: Yeah I reaaaally wish they would change affixes
[8:39:27] overparr: any plans for Hero to zero/bootcamp stuff thought that was great content?
[8:39:30] dranet11: thundering was completely putrid
[8:39:52] eyxx: hero to zero xddTree
[8:39:55] Larewt: Yeah the seasonal affixes were always pretty good. But the rotating weekly ones are pretty ass
[8:40:07] Grusomto_o: Every mmo copies each other one way or another.

[8:41:23] eyxx: it's the weekend xddShrug
[8:41:26] Larewt: 1/10 is like an employer hiring a bunch of people at once hoping to find one good one. Obviously you keep doing boot camps and then have an all star season with the good ones returning lol
[8:41:31] SomeGuyNamed: i'd engage you on more topics, but wvw is popping off FeelsOkayMan

[8:41:52] dranet11: i got platinum in gw2 pvp im pretty much rank 1
[8:42:01] Edeslash: i once had a university exam where over 50% of the students failed. When the teachers told us the news, they apologized, because it was their fault that so many people failed xddTree they were devastated by their own failure
[8:42:06] Edeslash: the lesson is you can just blame yourself!

[8:44:35] Edeslash: KYNNET
[8:45:09] Nani_GW: nah , its way more simple that that  Sneb , i think you are overcomplicating . I think people just hate homework , they dont mind getting better and listening while doing the encounter ,  but part of getting better is doing homework and practicing rota and doing something like log review , maybe reading a guide .  and those people just find that unfun becuase they wanna play the game
[8:45:21] Larewt: well they ended up being mechanically good enough to clear pretty much all the content. Maybe that's because the requirement for the growth  in skill isn't high enough?
[8:45:28] VagetarianSupreme: emi real mad about mirage
[8:45:35] caiilli: You recruited the wrong people then to be fair
[8:45:45] maplelost: ppl dont know how trash they are in gw2 cause theres no dmg meter
[8:45:53] focus1h: I dont have a big number of examples but most ppl that complained about gatekeeping to me personally usually just used it as an excuse to be bad at the game

[8:51:51] SomeGuyNamed: My internet has robbed me of the fun of wvw. The queue is 30. It's over. I am nothing. Despairge
[8:51:59] TriGreat: i have never heard of any gatekeeping
[8:52:04] JozzeTv: for a lot of people it might just be social anxiety. cause joining a community or creating their own group would fix the issue. but how do you bring someone with social anxiety to the solution?
[8:52:10] Edeslash: is this why wowhead guides spread endless misinfo
[8:52:32] alinoix: I agree with Teapot. I am an older women, I will never be as good as any of you guys but I still found a way to learn raids and find people to do it with
[8:52:34] Benjammn: Or telling someone who is depressed "just be happy"
[8:52:39] Dr3lll: I think complaining about gatekeeping just shows a failure of figuring out how to engage with the situation
[8:52:44] ciraxa: make a new chair Kappa
[8:52:47] Nani_GW: you dont
[8:53:21] Larewt: turns out it's a them problem and not an external problem lol
[8:53:35] spacecatprincess: @JozzeTv in my experience it helps a lot if they have 1-2 other close friends to tag along
[8:53:36] TriGreat: @alinoix depends how much you play the game. if u play 2 hours per week then sure, its just a very slow pace
[8:54:05] luigiormario: dragons stand gaming?
[8:54:15] spruudel: HOLY OBJECTIVELY

[8:54:37] focus1h: its called being delusional
[8:54:41] emecci: the truth is that we wiped for hours on smolderon
[8:54:43] ciraxa: who wouldnt
[8:54:46] JozzeTv: you can't fix those people
[8:54:49] spacecatprincess: LOL
[8:55:03] alinoix: @TriGreat I do not play much longer because I do not have time and stamina to do it haha
[8:55:11] SomeGuyNamed: lore SNIFFA
[8:55:26] Malganica: Malganica subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[8:55:32] Larewt: I dont understand how some people can feel gatekept when they haven't even put forth the smallest amount of effort
[8:55:40] Gorhaax: welcome to customer service
[8:55:40] JozzeTv: like, there are objective solutions, but they wont accept it. it's like talking to flat earthers
[8:55:57] alinoix: @Larewt YES!!
[8:56:02] Edeslash: my insomnia and anxiety have nothing to do with my rapidly degenerating mental health, they're purely the fault of Tindral nerfs
[8:56:07] focus1h: ppl go to reddit to vent and not to be convinced
[8:56:22] sethmalicious: i love it to
[8:56:49] TriGreat: @alinoix i am sensing that the time u do spend in game use it for what u enjoy. if u want to raid. u just spend that time to systematicaaly bring in solutions to get yourself closer to the content u want
[8:56:51] eyxx: i've started eating green rocks irl and i feel so much healthier
[8:56:56] ciraxa: WOOW
[8:57:06] Gorhaax: flat earthers are funny idiots
[8:57:07] SomeGuyNamed: NOWAYING
[8:57:11] Snebzor: @Larewt The "gatekeeping" is a symptom of deeper problems. They FEEL gatekept, but the other systems and problems in the game are making it more difficult for them, so they blame gatekeeping. BUT - they don't know that those other problems or pesky systems even exist.
[8:57:17] JozzeTv: there always has to be another solution, dispite people telling them the solution
[8:57:21] sethmalicious: but they still think is flat
[8:57:24] ViviLouF: @eyxx HOLY give me the coordinates to your nearest soulwell
[8:57:28] Debaros: The irony is they did the experiment to prove it was flat
[8:57:30] Debaros: didnt they?
[8:57:33] Larewt: The truth is to join any group you have to bring value, if you cannot justify what that value is and why that value exists then people don't owe you any sympathy. No one owes a carry to someone who hasn't put forth effort.
[8:57:44] Dr3lll: gatekept by curvature
[8:57:50] focus1h: u just move on to the next experiment until u find one that proves it
[8:57:54] focus1h: easy
[8:58:06] your7teacher: Wait the Earth isn't flat?
[8:58:08] Nani_GW: some lines needs to be drawn in the sand
[8:58:14] Benjammn: I saw another flat earth experience where they confirmed the exact curvature value of the earth
[8:58:25] alinoix: @TriGreat Yes, I mean people who talk about gatekeeping do want to do raids but do not want to spend time getting there. not sure if i make sense here lol
[8:58:47] spacecatprincess: i think there are some serious gains to be made with a better group finder system
[8:58:51] eyxx: do not ask why
[8:58:57] eyxx: only how
[8:59:21] Nani_GW: remember in dragons end ? where even when people won because they did sub groups and got boons , they still claimed its luck and its impossible
[8:59:25] Debaros: They say people can hold onto and be as attached to opinions like they are loved ones. Pretty sure I read that in a psychology meta study
[8:59:31] aFlyingGuru: its your fault Chadge
[8:59:58] TriGreat: alright its clear to me. the people who feel gate kept. they want only the clear, they should buy raids
[9:00:14] Larewt: admitting youre bad is the first step of reaching greatness
[9:00:18] spacecatprincess: guys i just salvaged 55 rares and got 57 ectos this is crazy
[9:00:20] focus1h: the raid buyers are the smart ones
[9:00:24] focus1h: ngl
[9:00:25] eyxx: i can't believe the evil hospitals gatekeep me from practicing medicine just because i don't have a doctorate RAGEY
[9:00:32] emecci: im the surfer

[9:01:08] Larewt: It definitely sucks to realize that you suck, but having the self awareness to realize that you suck is important in building motivation to getting better. Assuming you care that is.
[9:01:15] spacecatprincess: teapot ur inventory reminds me of my hoarding relatives
[9:01:38] spacecatprincess: the creature is demonic in nature
[9:02:13] zorgok: If you could opt out of getting loot in gw2, would you opt out of it?
[9:02:20] MightyTeapot: yes
[9:02:21] focus1h: not surprised snb
[9:02:24] TriGreat: bad boy sneb
[9:02:32] spacecatprincess: YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST! SNEB = IDIOT
[9:02:56] Larewt: It's okay to suck, it's not okay to know you suck and continue to suck while trying to do content that requires you to at least have hands.  If you don't care about that content, then keep suckin and having fun no big deal.
[9:03:19] Edeslash: i actually cant believe bigwigs got updated to tell everyone who the person who soaked a double seed on tindral is... i am NOT the problem
[9:03:21] vrotmnekrot: yeah, i had this realization just recently while struggling to pug +25 and onwards, looks like i'm just trash, and i joined 3 teams just this season so far and people just didn't show up to play, either i'm unlucky or i am just that bad, or both lmao, but either way i don't know what to do to make it better so i stopped playing for now
[9:03:26] eyxx: Wokege
[9:03:40] Lillerz_: i kick them GIGACHAD
[9:03:42] focus1h: yup tell them but dont argue with them
[9:03:42] PHOENIXf20: yes you shoul\
[9:03:42] Debaros: No because it just leads to worse morale for everyone
[9:03:51] focus1h: give them feedback without actually discussing it
[9:03:55] Larewt: In what content we talking? Mostly I assume they are basically half afk watching netflix and don't care
[9:04:01] nao_ir: situational
[9:04:13] fiendartisanisqtaf: I don't think people gives a shit if theres no failure state
[9:04:13] TriGreat: bend over
[9:04:17] Debaros: Whenever people did that in pvP - they would whine and become afk which was instrumentally worse than their poor performance
[9:04:29] focus1h: idk, I had good experience with raid feedback
[9:04:34] alinoix: yea I can not tell them
[9:04:40] eyxx: i refuse to not help them
[9:04:46] eyxx: i mail them advice irl
[9:04:52] Debaros: if we can clear the content i dont bother personally, if its a PUG
[9:04:55] Debaros: if its a static its different
[9:05:17] Larewt: gotta hit them with the, "You alright?" and see their response to that first lol
[9:05:23] eyxx: HOLY
[9:05:30] Edeslash: SNAILS
[9:05:45] eyxx: Zerustettu
[9:05:50] Debaros: @Larewt or "Erm, are you aware you are doing less dps than our healer?"
[9:06:04] spacecatprincess: me when i discover the concept of "tough love"
[9:06:09] focus1h: yeah, if it has no consequence to be bad they will not think its important enough (which it isnt)
[9:06:12] Owldera: if its PUGs, then usually don't bother. If its organized groups, people need to be told and aware they will receive critique and need to be able to take it
[9:06:16] ciraxa: our old static died because we didnt kick the one player who was playing badly sajj
[9:06:31] focus1h: ciraxa I think most statics die to that thing
[9:06:33] MightyTeaBot: doot doot
[9:06:36] AtuV_Hierophant: doot doot Û†ÄÄ
[9:06:37] MightyTeaBot: ATUV_HIEROPHANT IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
[9:06:44] Larewt: I've never done it in GW2 but in WoW my group often kicks someone and then gives them the explaination and a solution. Normally we never see that person again but occasionally they hit us up again and say Hey I looked into what you said
[9:06:45] Edeslash: ban this cheater wtf
[9:06:48] ghostkobold_: I am in agreement. kick people that cant perform, offer training though, and def praise them if they improve.
[9:06:54] Edeslash: @eyxx ICANT
[9:07:34] ghostkobold_: If your goal isnt to hit a level of play you shouldnt be in a group where that level of play is expected of you.
[9:07:46] girlscoutcookie420: oh dont worry surely not everyone is thinking that someone else will tell them
[9:08:35] eyxx: i think a significant thing here is how some people (in some contexts at least) view any and all conflict and negativity as inherently evil
[9:08:41] eyxx: it's a bit of a cultural issue
[9:09:03] Larewt: YES, chill but with purpose is a great way to explain it.
[9:09:15] ghostkobold_: Let them stop imo
[9:09:18] Debaros: chill with purpose is my goal for games tbh
[9:09:20] ADB_Freelancer: I seen times where both sides will never go again too
[9:09:30] Edeslash: 5:30 DRAUBED good night
[9:10:11] dranet11: i was kicked for this reason xddTree
[9:10:12] Gorhaax: dun dun dun
[9:10:29] Debaros: I mean if its adult and people are mature in admitting its just not for them then thats fine but nobody just accepts they have different goals
[9:10:31] Debaros: and just leaves
[9:10:33] Nani_GW: people just dont wanna put the work that is outside the immediate content to get better , they think doing rota  or log review or whatever is waste of time and its the opposite if the goal is to get better
[9:10:55] spruudel: SNAILS
[9:11:56] Debaros: True but you lose out also by sticking in a place you arent a good fit for. The feeling of losing out is heavy for sure, but thats also because people dont think beyond that they could find somewhere better for them
[9:12:08] Edeslash: from my experience it's incredibly imporant for a guild's roster to have matching expectations about goals, learning and improving
[9:12:15] ciraxa: you can keep bad players if there¬¥s a reasonable chance that they improve, in that case bench them temporarily to keep moral of the main team up
[9:12:16] Debaros: it reminds me of when people stick in a job or career when they hate it but they worry about the alternative being worse
[9:12:33] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[9:12:49] NotYetRatedd: it's 4:30, all this energy couldve gone into KEYS DRAUBED
[9:13:10] Debaros: Oh I agree on the empathy - Im not saying its a silly feeling or anything, I just think we sabotage our own happiness in that context
[9:13:12] Debaros: and it sucks to see
[9:13:18] spruudel: non degen schedule ICANT
[9:13:25] dolordolo: bro is going to sleep at 6am ICANT

[9:14:36] JozzeTv: time for the first purge ^^
[9:14:38] eyxx: i've yet to play wow in the post-20 hours awake or post-gym insanity state
[9:14:42] eyxx: maybe i should
[9:14:55] Debaros: Realest advice I ever got: you are here for a limited time, alive I mean. Pursue your happiness, true happiness not superficial. Even if thats being a casual carebear. If thats what makes you happy then do it. Its your time and its limited, and that applies on a more narrow sense in games.
[9:15:04] spacecatprincess: good players will recognize when they fuck up and get angrier at themselves than anyone else in their group
[9:15:05] ciraxa: not all good players are like that, some just really need to be pushed
[9:15:05] NotYetRatedd: NAILS
[9:15:38] Debaros: Detox
[9:15:41] maplelost: RIPBOZO
[9:15:44] Debaros: we are Detoxing
[9:15:50] Debaros: whatup21Clap whatup21Clap whatup21Clap
[9:15:52] Nani_GW: YEP , good players hate being the anchor , and they will try to improve on their own
[9:16:10] Edeslash: @byrchi im just gonna go ahead and say it. You're not good enough for muisted :( but i think you already knew that. I didn't have to say this, but I still did, in this very public context. I hope you don't find this excessively rude or toxic
[9:16:24] maplelost: what exactly is the criteria for the cleanse? u play gw2 = ban or what
[9:16:24] Debaros: I see a lot of good players with low self-esteem. I dont see a lot of stubborn players who suddenly become good
[9:16:28] Owldera: they should be constantly looking for ways to improve on their own, weather its by finding a coach or starting their own groups or finding new guild who train
[9:16:32] dolordolo: if you dont think are hot garbage at the perticular videogame you are simply never going to be the #1
[9:16:37] dolordolo: xddShrug
[9:16:38] Debaros: generally the skill or potential is there - the confidence is usually whats lacking in my experience
[9:16:46] dolordolo: *you are
[9:17:19] Larewt: some people dont need you to open the door for them, they just need to be shown the door I guess
[9:17:21] focus1h: but still you gave her a very good perspective she might never have had
[9:17:22] Nani_GW: 4Head
[9:17:25] focus1h: outside of beating the content

[9:21:46] Nani_GW: yeah its 0 , just checked
[9:21:49] Nani_GW: LUL
[9:21:50] Debaros: Am I the only one who gets excited when I see 0 lfgs? To me that screams 'OMG I WILL HAVE MY PICK OF ALL THE PLAYERS WHEN I MAKE MY GROUP'
[9:21:52] ciraxa: its WvW beta tho
[9:21:53] VagetarianSupreme: cause playerbase is the big sad
[9:21:55] focus1h: eu was also really dead in raid lfg

[9:22:26] Debaros: there are alot of new players in maps i see during my gift of exploration grind
[9:22:29] Larewt: I've played gw2 for years and never actually done t4 fractals
[9:22:31] dolordolo: hmm I wonder why the raid/fractal lfg is getting worse every month hmmm curious xddTree xddTree xddTree
[9:22:31] Debaros: they did say SOTO sold a lot didnt they
[9:22:39] Edeslash: BOGGED the gateseed has been successful, freedom agents
[9:22:55] spacecatprincess: if you want a good place to  find new players, the HoT maps are a great start
[9:22:59] Nani_GW: sneb in the time you talked 4 groups popped up and filled within micro seconds @Snebzor
[9:23:16] Debaros: They try to make an lfg in t4 and the game refuses to allow it "You are being gatekeeped"
[9:23:24] ciraxa: 3:44
