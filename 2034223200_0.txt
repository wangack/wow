[0:14:52] Pixiepantss: the premades have been awful lately
[0:15:00] Smooo07: it shouldnt be hard
[0:15:04] Jojjent: Joined premades this weekend, was a breeze

[0:15:56] draqcula: I gave up on WSG a while ago and tweeted at one of the SOD devs about it like a month ago no reply or traction at that time
[0:16:00] SirHeiska: Its crazy how this is an issue in every classic version.
[0:16:00] DucktorLarsen: Aggrend have already commented on pre-made vs pre-made queues
[0:16:03] Seoken1: dude the lack of matchmaking is just as bad. I had an actual game that STARTED earlier today, where horde had 6 players, and we were matched against a full premade LUL
[0:16:26] Smooo07: premade is just an afk angle PepeLa
[0:16:30] 21Khal: my fish trap sajj
[0:16:31] Smooo07: yea pls
[0:16:33] XezNinety: They aren't
[0:16:37] Jojjent: Pug vs pug-wsg can be a total rush with clutch plays
[0:16:41] Arthident: surely in arathi there wont be any premades keking
[0:16:41] Wolok: YEP AB OP
[0:16:48] XezNinety: He basically said, just make a premade and queue

[0:17:14] Ewriick: UgWave
[0:17:21] draqcula: There is magic happening when you meet new players and have to team up / organize to win a bg but playing agaisnt premades all the time kills that magic
[0:17:25] Boopersan: i do it all the time on alliance too for the mulgore one
[0:17:25] Seoken1: yeah it was messed up, and then people would join and see it was a premade and also afk out lol
[0:17:26] CarsInTheSky: its exploiting

[0:17:51] Jojjent: I feel as the dev time to fix pug vs premade is larger than we recon - a lot of SOD stuff is "low" in cost, as a majority adding NPC and quests

[0:53:48] Ewriick: @Guzu Hear me out. What if priests had arune where they could go into a mode where they would be "selfish" priests, spending holy power on damage mitigation and self-heal so they could tank? Maybe add increased heal threats to that or something, or an opposite of Mind Soothe/Fade.
[0:53:51] jimzan1: One thing that could be really cool is "Serpent Form" like the druids in WC.

[0:57:29] Modebc: im i the only one that likes roll the bones
[0:57:30] zodd_amhai: true
[0:57:32] Parshce: Nah keep 2 handers chunky

[0:57:34] p5ycc: for warrior Heroic Leap?
[0:57:34] ashtaroxx: i want guzu's grip plink
[0:57:36] RiftaHere: Did they just have an RNG app choose random spells and abilities from TBC to DF and throw it into an article without review? That article completely missed the mark
[0:57:38] FueledGames: YEP
[0:57:38] cthunderssj: I don't want titan's grip either
[0:57:40] dhatsun: Titan Grip messes up itemization
[0:57:42] tacoking011: I don't want Titan's grip and im a warrior main
[0:57:43] Phooshie: @Trexbo_ AND it's not an official site either..
[0:57:44] VampLUL: Titansgrip with a big 2h and Dagger in Offhand for deep wounds LUL

[0:57:59] Smooo07: i seriously hope they add NEW stuff
[0:57:59] pyrodave: titans grip but isntead of dual wielding 2 2h, you duct tape 2 2h into one bigger 2h?
[0:58:01] Tigrex90: maybe an improved dual wield 1 2hand and 1 1hand as a rune?

[0:59:16] Trexbo_: If anything, maybe they wanted to get "likely predictions"
[0:59:19] MadManMatuszewski: hunter trap in combat? @Guzu
[0:59:22] flowerpew: @Guzu iAsk I have an original idea. A rune for rogues that lets you put a 3rd melee in ranged slot, and you swing with 3 weapons
[0:59:25] Mana_Screw: @yverna14 guzuL
[0:59:29] geennaamnl1: The co-caster that xaryu always cast with ( I don't know his name the black guy ) he had a nice video about quality of life  runes ideas but I cant find the video
[0:59:30] Yvernaa: @Mana_Screw hugg
[0:59:38] Smooo07: huh
[0:59:38] kaiten9: Hunter trap in combat would be a huge buff

[1:00:10] Llyan74: why did Guzu look down when he said "where you gonna put that 3rd weapon"?
[1:00:12] 3Brick_: @Guzu maybe let mages cast scorch while moving a passive rune. I think passive runes are the play for Phase 2
[1:00:15] kaiten9: notably for the melee hunter, just get those mostly unused survival talents to use
[1:00:16] Trainingtobeperson: Hunter rune to put a weapon in pets mouth, need more to roll on
[1:00:17] Wolok: BAGS

[1:03:49] GULLASCHBARON: no pre questing
[1:03:49] leonkoowsky: when phase two?
[1:03:50] eskilator_gl: I think making a "Way of the Wind" rune like the current "Way of Earth" rune would go a long way for 2hand sham. Make stormstrike empower WF for higher proc chance and letting you work with lightning bolt for Overload rune synergy.
[1:03:57] viclund1: @Smooo07 KEKW i believe it

[1:04:28] toooth: @Smooo07 👋 Jotchua
[1:04:30] Trexbo_: I do hope they change the runes a little in Phase 2 to allow 2 hander shaman, or just make certain rule combinations doable like put Druid's Lacerate in the leg slot instead so tanks dont need to choose between Mangle or Lacerate

[2:37:41] necromahr: is shaman not more fun ? :)
[2:37:42] Hyzen88: He PoM instead of dispelling, Tymbur. 2x Flash Heal cancel, doesn't Rank 1 renew PoM bounce, doesn't Shield for safety net, doesn't abuse the damage aura to maximize PoM. Nope he came in here like he never practiced proper healing under pressure. I felt really disgusted and even more when he tried to deflect it. Guzu is actually a toxic player he tries to hide it most of the time.
[2:37:44] Nikoftz27: NPCing
[2:37:51] rourfoses: @Guzu can you be ele with that tanking rune on shaman?

[2:38:31] Toastedyogurt: I will say this once and hope you people understand it. Him not healing properly? Not a problem. Him always deflecting his fault? " I did pretty good there" comment is the part that doesn't sit well I believe not only with me but also many others and it isn't the first time he does it.

[2:49:27] Wizzlo: Guzu, are you from sjælland?
[2:49:28] KyoouN: what I find weird is that deadly poison is not even available without the rune, which would make envenom useless. so a dependency rune currently
