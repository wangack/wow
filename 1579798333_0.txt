[0:43:48] picc0: @hotsauce319 they removed the cap for globals

[0:44:05] ConcernedGaming: @hotsauce319 It was capped at 35 for both Regionals and live. But they removed the cap for FInals because they will likely do Junkyard and 35ing Junkyard is easy

[1:54:03] Naguura: @PhysicsHaiku im not 100% sure, but i think that effect just always procs, because almost anything is considered "hitting from behind"
[1:54:14] moderatygos: score is calculated by the keys they've done, so if ambition has done a dungeon that others haven't, they'll have a higher score
[1:54:15] Nox1o: @CozyWoW they did an extra 26 instead of pushing a 29
[1:54:19] Garysteel1984: HUH

[2:38:10] binature: low key btw
[2:38:35] datsussyguy: A lower lower kara
[2:38:36] fragileplasma: They played Zulg in the "lower" streets runs
[2:38:46] AwkwardLUL: A lot of diversity in comps lol
[2:39:10] lhatefizz: casual 250k from clickz, nice class :)
[2:39:46] AwkwardLUL: I'd love Aff to be the go to lock class for DF
[2:39:47] puaka: it got nerfed, too.
[2:40:02] whitehounds: @AwkwardLUL top players play what's best, who'd a thonk it
[2:40:23] tornerOOO: how much time is left?
[2:40:29] moderatygos: 3 hours 42 minutes
[2:40:34] AwkwardLUL: @whitehounds no, I get that, but I mean the fact that THESE are the comps that need to be played is kind of meh
[2:40:49] whitehounds: why
[2:40:53] tornerOOO: @omniscientautoma thx
[2:40:53] Barbossa190: forsenHappy
[2:40:55] scilla3497: There was more comp diversity in regionals cuz people were less sure what is good
[2:40:56] AwkwardLUL: It'd be nice to have 2-3 different comps capable of competing with eachother.
[2:41:00] Sinaa: Feral Druid is best dps but nobody knows because they never try it FailFish
[2:41:00] fragileplasma: @AwkwardLUL Why? Cause its not the class you play?
[2:41:02] Shearin77: @AwkwardLUL i love my aff lock too
[2:41:19] AwkwardLUL: @witheringprism I play Warlock and Hunter....
[2:41:20] moderatygos: TWO HOURS NOT THREE
[2:41:21] moderatygos: SORRY
[2:41:22] mad0monk: Obswerver Fail!
[2:41:27] moderatygos: 2 hours 41 minutes
[2:41:28] Moridyn: @AwkwardLUL There will always be something that is .1% better

[2:41:31] Moobot: Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[2:41:34] ModeraYsera: maff
[2:41:35] mason_ii: there literally are tho. Double lock Hunter. Hunter Lock Mage, and Lock Mage Rogue @AwkwardLUL
[2:41:43] moderatygos: i need mathnos to help me figure out times
[2:41:55] datsussyguy: If one comp is 0.5% better than  the other, everyone is gonna play it, that’s just how meta works
[2:42:16] WhoIsAndrewJ: i remember when locks had meta
[2:42:16] blakexoxoxo: is that team chinese? how many chinese teams are there in tgp?
[2:42:16] AwkwardLUL: Maybe for WoW, I suppose, yeah.
[2:42:23] fragileplasma: @AwkwardLUL Then you complaint makes no sense wtf do you mean by "THESE"
[2:42:24] Omnimorphic: I want to see a 5-druid comp
[2:42:30] whitehounds: you're not allowed to spec stack here, right
[2:42:35] AverageDaeg: Certainly other comps are *capable*, there's 29s-30s being timed on live servers with them.
[2:42:37] moderatygos: correct, no spec stacking
[2:42:39] Thoreya: no
[2:42:39] Shearin77: @blakexoxoxo 2 .. zhixu and performance
[2:42:41] ModeraYsera: @blakexoxoxo 2 teams from each region made it to global finals
[2:42:45] picc0: @blakexoxoxo it's 2 teams per region of NA, EU and CN
[2:42:50] AverageDaeg: But of course you're going to see the best/meta in high end competitive content
[2:42:56] Fredioca: mage is metta just because PI
[2:42:59] theslorp: I wish iron stars didn’t exist. It’s cool seeing top teams think of fun starts but they do that either way, and it’s way less fun than actually playing the game on live
[2:43:01] Omnimorphic: rip my 5-druid comp then
[2:43:11] blakexoxoxo: KR region doesn't participate? thank you for the answers
[2:43:28] Shearin77: @blakexoxoxo no
[2:43:30] whitehounds: @AwkwardLUL people playing what's meta is normal in like all competitive games
[2:43:31] Nox1o: can we see ambition to check out their possible 3 chest?
[2:43:39] fizzytopp: These echo guys sure are mediocre
[2:43:44] AverageDaeg: @theslorp To be fair they existed before M+ did, but I don't disagree.
[2:43:53] fragileplasma: I mean not really, the front page of say iron docks is entirely Rogue mage hunter lock
[2:43:58] whitehounds: @fizzytopp y not even 4chesting
[2:43:59] AwkwardLUL: @whitehounds doesn't mean top  of the meta can't be more diversified lol
[2:44:07] Lorrdzik: @fizzytopp LUL LUL
[2:44:20] darkhorror93: 2 chest and cant finish 32 ?
[2:44:24] philx: how do they stop Baron Druegers whirlwind?
[2:44:24] picc0: @theslorp at least they are target capped
[2:44:28] whitehounds: didn't say otherwise
[2:44:30] mad0monk: Can you guys put Ambition back up? Would much rather watch the better teams, crazy that Echo never leaves the screen but Ambition keeps getting rotated out
[2:44:30] datsussyguy: PVP games at least have some kind of rock-paper-scissors, but wow PVE just have a single best solution
[2:44:31] rogueous: Ambition were 48 sec after echo on moroes if im right?
[2:44:43] rogueous: on 26
[2:45:04] Nox1o: ambtion for 3chest please
[2:45:15] Thoreya: @mad0monk RT
[2:45:18] proxy2gate: wait, is survival hunter a ranged class now? or is it still melee
[2:45:21] Nox1o: its acutally important
[2:45:31] whitehounds: @proxy2gate melee
[2:45:31] mortank89: @proxy2gate both
[2:45:36] Shearin77: @proxy2gate a bit of both
[2:45:40] just_ok_viewer: i feel so bad for the Chinese teams playing at like 3am
[2:45:44] Lorrdzik: @dasmartestguy I would say it worst because then you don't win becaue you are better but because you have better counter class
[2:45:45] AwkwardLUL: @proxy2gate melee, but has ability to be ranged
[2:45:52] Omnimorphic: neither
[2:45:55] raikoneN_: @proxy2gate hybrid, most of the dmg is ranged
[2:45:57] Pyroxic: @proxy2gate melee, but plays heavily from range with their bomb resets
[2:45:59] rogueous: ye wierd we cant se ambition most interesting right now
[2:46:09] Thoreya: we never see end of ambition keys LUL
[2:46:10] datsussyguy: Surv hunters only lose a little dps when ranged, melee and raptor strike
[2:46:11] proxy2gate: survival used to be one of the worst classes in the game at the start of shadowlands. why is it meta now?
[2:46:12] JMPanamos: hi
[2:46:25] Cyphixoxo: I am very sure last AWC the best team won because everyone played outlaw rmp anyway smileyface
[2:46:26] mason_ii: tier set @proxy2gate
[2:46:29] moderatygos: survival has really good aoe
[2:46:32] darklyy90: @proxy2gate 4 set is giga broken

[2:46:32] Axestro: @proxy2gate insane tier set.
[2:46:34] karbonMAYne: 85-90% of their dam is ranged and they have an ability that lets you cast their melee abilities (except melee hits) at range
[2:46:35] Nox1o: @dasmartestguy Cant really compare it. In pvp there would be best comps if they knew what they were up against
[2:46:35] JeditOjanen: @proxy2gate Tier gear makes it insane
[2:46:36] Shearin77: @proxy2gate ask blizzard
[2:46:38] scilla3497: @proxy2gate Tier set is busted
[2:46:38] raikoneN_: @dasmartestguy you got a cd to make raptor strike ranged though as well
[2:46:39] just_ok_viewer: @proxy2gate it was always decent in M+, but tier set really made it awesome
[2:46:45] Pyroxic: @proxy2gate tier set resets bombs
[2:46:47] caio_btc: @just_ok_viewer  i feel so bad for the Chinese
[2:47:08] Deefin34: zhixu is running 2 locks instead of mage for 2nd range interesting seems to be playing out okay
[2:47:13] wigren98: Ambition never on screen?
[2:47:21] Nox1o: can anyone who controls these cameras please go to ambition? we should know if they make a 3chest. COME ON
[2:47:22] mad0monk: Chat spam AMBITION so we can see the end of the damn key
[2:47:26] Hephistos: SHow Ambition lower plz !
[2:47:39] AwkwardLUL: @Deefin34 The demo lock doesn't really seem to be putting up a lot of damage tho
[2:47:42] nazragna: no love for ambition

[2:49:35] Sinaa: They have to fullscreen Ambition now to make up

[4:49:57] unluckythen: @unluckythen what does it do
[4:49:59] BadManners_: xCeciix yeah , easy on paper , but tank just command people to go there but rest of the party doesnt know LuL
[4:50:23] ThomoJames: @MerkerTheRet cringe
[4:50:29] moderatygos: @unluckythen the affix lets you pick a secondary stat and every time you kill a demon you get a stack of the secondary stat buff, i believe most people play haste buff
[4:50:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Jailer is lucky that he's not doing dailies in the Maw like Sylvanas
[4:50:40] moderatygos: the demons are hid as normal mobs throughout the dungeon

[4:53:14] Unstabledh: Why noone plays guardian druid?
[4:53:20] xCeciix: @BadManners_ Agreeeed! Which happens how often in PUGS?! And honestly.. The baby pulls on trash that most tanks do in there, counts more on the speed of the run, then stacking those 2 bosses. They generally die fast enough anyway!
[4:53:29] Sleepypan: haste is POGGERS
[4:53:40] KingJuichi: @Unstabledh Because self-heal is too low for +30s
[4:53:44] holyybunny: @BadManners_ ngl though... as a tank its really difficult to do big pulls in pugs

[5:06:51] Ujai321: everybody: zul'gamux. ambition: zul'gamuxn't.
[5:06:57] ModeraYsera: @SalonenGG im on pc and its fine. It might just be due to your screen size or its resolution capabilities, sorry.
[5:06:57] Dota360: they might just townportal and go into lower if they aren't making the timer
[5:07:08] Sleepypan: @Hregoth by doing dmg spoooKEKW
[5:07:14] raikoneN_: last week teams had like +1 mins extra to start keys if they said they wanted to (:
[5:07:33] moohuu: @SalonenGG you might try out the youtube stream. for me the quality is a tad bit better over there and numbers/text are easier to read
[5:07:36] Sunless_AK: no way they make it in time
[5:07:45] Silverdevilboy: @raikonen_ Only if they were done with the existing key
[5:07:57] Kelubrik: @raikoneN_ Yes, but if they are in a dungeon when the clock hits that is their last.
[5:08:10] 1Comander: ambition cant run other key, they didnt take the full 15m rest.....
[5:08:27] Dornok: ellesmere low mana tho
[5:08:27] Ujai321: also remember this stream has a bit of a delay
[5:08:40] ModeraYsera: @1Comander Ambition took all of their req breaks
[5:08:42] gruthori: 25min gambit is +2?
[5:08:46] fragileplasma: @1Comander even if thats true theres still over 10 minutes to start the next key

[5:11:07] Blightrose: america hasnt caught on to metric minutes yet, they are still stuck on foot minutes
[5:11:10] Silverdevilboy: Silly casters, the only difference in time in metric is that we say the seconds before the minutes.
[5:11:11] moohuu: @SalonenGG np, mate.  You might try turning off the "low latency mod" here on twitch. this might improve it a bit too. but yt keeps beeing ahead for me

[5:17:54] DeathLV: wait, which were the EU teams?
[5:17:54] Sebleh: I guess Echo pulled the boss because there’s still 3ish minutes left. They either save time or start over.

[5:27:58] Grortraugh: hmm
[5:27:59] Bashiel: glyph of cthulhu angel form
[5:28:00] fragileplasma: @nazragna the timer on the screen is 2 minutes ahead of what you're seeing the teams do, they started the key well in time
[5:28:01] Shearin77: HUH
[5:28:02] Ujai321: if the broadcast says "time is up", the timer on screen says "time is up", but time is not actually up, that is something the broadcast needs to fix.
[5:28:02] Gandrik: @TClear you´re *
[5:28:03] theosmokey: Isn’t the timer on the stream that we seen on the same delay ?

[5:28:13] Ravenlynnwolf: they have the valkryie
[5:28:14] CrerisRs: @Davethecave all 4 EU teams got the same treatement last Sunday too, they all started a new fresh key after timer went to 0
[5:28:14] DeathLV: dont pour any more alcohol for that guy
[5:28:15] moohuu: so you can say "our healer is a DRAGON?! Our healer is a DRAGON!"
[5:28:18] KareiTV: Make it a Val'Kyr

[5:28:30] draz1234567: @Lorrdzik i get made all the time
[5:28:33] Vodrin: @Ujai321 it didn't say "time is up" LuL
[5:28:45] Aurhora3: @Lorrdzik They didnt, it only looked sus because of dealy, this time they legit said it was overtime :)
[5:28:52] AGGRO___: TTours new angle pls
[5:28:56] Icyxox: @HampzWoW Nah not complaining about the "headstart" or anything, I'm genuinely confused and new to TGP format, I don't understand what "pad time" is
[5:28:56] TheRealDeo_: This chat, lmao
[5:28:59] Shearin77: yawn
[5:29:01] Lorrdzik: @Davethecave Like Monka last week.

[5:29:28] draz1234567: @Naguura you would say that being from EU :)

[5:32:30] tettles: @Im_anDe ive picked them 3 times in a row now..
[5:32:35] the_jeffmeister: I think Monka can do another key with their grace period
[5:32:36] Sebleh: @feanor952 admins decided they could have a 30-60 second grace period.
[5:32:49] Saithe96: Gj Monka u proved all the haters wrong xD

[5:33:07] heyitsferris: @재치있는 We've been consistent with our ruling over the various rulings regarding timings, and can confirm that Echo entered (and started) their final key before the Tournament Time was over for the day.

[5:33:27] vision2111: grass is overrated :)
[5:33:28] Xynthos_Gaming: 🌱
[5:33:32] ModeraYsera: To clarify - the tournament administration has been monitoring the global timer and can verify that Echo entered (and started) their final dungeon of the day with 20 seconds left on the official Tournament Clock.
[5:33:33] vocalpenguin: touch grass BatChest
[5:33:36] careface89: @재치있는 말많네 그냥봐 ㅡㅡ
[5:33:37] saintfrancis: would there be value in still playing it out for practice if they wanted?
[5:33:39] Sleepypan: touching grass is dangerous though last time i went outside i got covid LUL
[5:33:39] Shearin77: i wouldn't go outside now in the EU to touch the grass
[5:33:42] dahyyun: @Naguura There's no way, bad take
[5:33:46] tettles: @Naguura ?

[5:34:22] treesdesu: @Xynthos_Gaming kalieynStare kalieynDeplete

[5:34:31] moohuu: @Naguura that's just the boomkin in you talking

[5:34:47] dustin_handsupdb: @Naguura @tettles you're right on the dark horse thing - a dark horse has to be previously unknown/unrenown
[5:34:55] Dota360: isn't this going to be 2 points for donuts and put them equal to the other 2 teams?
[5:35:06] Lythi: @heyitsferris hi, big fan
[5:35:12] requzzx: hello
[5:35:24] requzzx: how are u guys
[5:35:26] Sleepypan: me reading the deleted comments HypePopcorn
[5:35:29] heyitsferris: @Lythi @Lythi hi, big fan
[5:35:31] Sebleh: @naguura have you considered that you shouldn’t booli tettles if he’s too color blind to tell what a dark horse looks like? naguuraWeirdChamp
[5:35:38] Werhammer: @heyitsferris wow real ferris!!!
[5:35:44] Davethecave: atleast we get people banned on twitch. chat for awc and mdi on yt is very weird
[5:35:54] Omnimorphic: has there been a great push to push the highest key instead of points?
[5:35:54] Sebleh: @heyitsferris big fan btw naguuraFest
[5:36:09] moderatygos: !info
[5:36:09] Moobot: @omniscientautoma Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[5:36:13] moderatygos: this format is about highest key
[5:36:17] lurkbelow82: Kappa sure
[5:36:24] dustin_handsupdb: @Omnimorphic uhhh that's what this is? points is highest key
[5:36:25] Goku_Flexx: Ah yes Metric time
[5:36:32] boo_doo: o huh, dont understand why my msg got deleted - but think commentors just explained how they got 1 more kara run
[5:36:37] Dota360: @tettles don't donuts get to 118 off the gambit and would win on tiebreak or can you go through the logic of why that's not the case
[5:36:39] Tremin: @Omnimorphic isn't this what they're literally doing? you get a point pr. key level so it is about highest keys?
[5:36:40] Hadokenryu: NA be like "surprised Pikachu face" now
[5:36:49] listrel1: Bear Squad Smoge
[5:36:49] Xyyni: Metric clock
[5:36:50] Attackinson: So the timer you show us just doesnt matter good to know
[5:37:11] nokeycs: Guys just check the time on ***, echo finished at 23:59.
[5:37:12] Xynthos_Gaming: TheIlluminati
[5:37:13] Saithe96: @Attackinson it is an estimate
[5:37:14] moderatygos: on screen timer can give an estimate
[5:37:16] chebrawski: BatChest -> 0
[5:37:17] theslinny: Ambition sweating right now
[5:37:17] ModeraYsera: stream delay is a thing, as we have said many times before
[5:37:20] cetizz: Message deleted for the timer on screeen not accurate, really ?
[5:37:21] CrerisRs: @Attackinson might also be desync on the feed from the team observer
[5:37:24] moderatygos: the same way you ask in chat and i tell you how much time is left
[5:37:26] Atro_TV: mods are benefiting from tyrannical week
[5:37:26] AlpineIron: Why show a timer if it the correct time?
[5:37:26] laughtalez: i hope donuts and disnuts will pass today i like dorky
[5:37:27] 4stronauth: don't they lose time with deaths?
[5:37:28] theslinny: nerf died with 3 mobs alive
[5:37:30] Tremin: @Dota360 team performance and Zhixu are at 117 and will be at 119 if they complete their keys, so there will be no tie breaker, either they fail and are 117 or get to 119
[5:37:40] boo_doo: its like football, technically 45 mins per half, but teams get extra time if there was legitimate downtime
[5:37:41] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[5:37:48] Sleepypan: @4stronauth yes
[5:38:03] Shearin77: trust in the admins guys !
[5:38:04] Dota360: @Dota360 oh right i'm stuck on the logic that they'll +1 but they're collecting the 2 points from a previous +2
[5:38:11] Davethecave: Ye it looked kinda rigged cuz timer on stream was on 0 and we're told the timer was on 20 sec left
[5:38:19] vischasbaver: how many points will the get for the 32? with only a 28 complete
[5:38:23] Yelolyayla: if they do not finish the +32 I blame it on them choosing the most difficult key they can do
[5:38:26] TheRealDeo_: thank goodness for moderators lol. These aggressive message are a bit much. Passion and negativity arent the same
[5:38:33] Vodrin: monkaS
[5:38:33] KradishUK: D&D just trying to flex their way out the door by getting the first 32 of the globals
[5:38:36] Wrutanks: LUL what is happening
[5:38:37] tooper08: gota live to fight another day
[5:38:38] moderatygos: alright guys, we've heard you, chill out about the timer
[5:38:40] Omnimorphic: I meant the winner is the one with the highest key
[5:38:53] haram_abi: holy this is some crazy damage control
