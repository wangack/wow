[0:06:20] notagreyname: Normal urine is clear and has a straw-yellow color. When the urine does not have its characteristic clear appearance, it is often referred to as cloudy, turbid, or foamy urine. Cloudy or foamy urine may occur occasionally due to mild dehydration; when it occurs in the absence of symptoms and goes away rapidly, it is usually of little consequence.

[6:25:59] captaincunk: The pug is a breed of dog distinguished by a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.

The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. pugPls

The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. pugPls

The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. pugPls
