[1:29:16] Nonyamuff: That meow kills me
[1:29:29] itsbigwade: why are people lusting priestess? The fight is the same length regardless. Is there something i'm missing?
[1:32:10] KDaily: they did it for lust timing and becuase they pulled trash into it
[1:32:25] KDaily: had to use there or wasnt back for yazma

[1:34:16] face2face: At 3:13.4 on the fight duration
[1:34:43] KDaily: pretty sure that was tanks pool
[1:35:21] face2face: Yeah the DH runs around that area a half second before, tthe tank runs on top of you at the same time
[1:35:28] face2face: It's not really picking you twice within 1s necessarily
[1:35:35] face2face: But you walked into a pool you didnt see

[1:37:17] gambleragain: how does rdruid deal with bursting efficiently? just healing/
[1:38:52] Lara_TV_: heyo, I know y'all are insane, but I've also been annoyed by random trees baiting, I think pinging nearby trees and having the tank move the juggernauts to them can help, assuming they are able to
[1:39:02] Lara_TV_: Since the min range for baiting is really small

[2:02:46] CyonDru: bro has one message and been following since today lmao
[2:02:53] devilhawk83: chrysLUL Got deleted
[2:02:56] Spritesgud: why does every m+ group sound miserable lmao XD
[2:03:43] KDaily: no one sounds happy when theyre in the trenches
[2:03:50] Spritesgud: and now it's just despair? lol
[2:04:12] bebincalicious: EB pepeLaugh
[2:04:44] Spritesgud: So is your guild done raiding or are you finished raiding with the guild?
[2:05:53] gambleragain: it gets a bit depressing
[2:05:58] dithrica: did keys for 12 hours yesterday, the only one that gave me io was the first one I did üôÉ
[2:06:06] KDaily: IO every 1 in 10 keys?
[2:06:46] Varthar: do you think they can fix needing to do so many homework keys without just making it so that you just reset a gigapull over and over like mdi
[2:06:48] Whitewolf1441: wf keys?? like what
[2:06:56] Varthar: like maybe past 25 you can deplete 3x before it lowers?
[2:07:14] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[2:07:33] Lara_TV_: They should definitely do at least 2 tries, like a keystone gets "cracked" once or twice before depleting
[2:07:37] gambleragain: @Varthar thats actually smart
[2:07:47] gambleragain: after a certain lvl keys should not deplete
[2:08:28] devilhawk83: I was really hoping ya timed that 31 Fall as that run was going so smoothly till that Eartsurge chrysCry
[2:08:37] Spritesgud: yeah blizz needs to make some improvement on the system because currently its kinda doggy
[2:08:37] justbeachi: 15 min is just so arbitrary though lol. idk why you can't just keep slamming
[2:08:59] DKSCP_Rogers_x: how do you keep your wrist from hurting mine kills rubbing on the table constantly
[2:09:25] gambleragain: I saw the video of you and Max about tier lists of seasons. And i genuinely like the idea of dungeons getting harder by dmg and health, but rather less time to time it.
[2:09:37] bebincalicious: you reckon that wouldn't be the issue with another dps
[2:11:15] Whitewolf1441: how do other classes survive with no bear form?
[2:11:45] scheriel: I mean they have it better than shamans at least LUL
[2:11:56] devilhawk83: yep
[2:12:40] gambleragain: after 25s lower the time
[2:13:06] gambleragain: is it hard for some people of influence in the scene suggest this to blizzard?
[2:13:19] VacaSlamBang: reduce dmg scaling after 25s ?
[2:13:28] joemitch: "open to suggestions"
[2:13:33] ragelius: ragelius subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! hey jb  been watchin u runnin around valdrakken like crazy had to come see stream too xD wasnt que simulator atleast XD
[2:13:39] Simkha: Wouldnt you kinda run into the same issue with a reducing timer tho? Would that feel any much better?
[2:13:50] KinarPT: No one at Blizzard than plays High Keys....
[2:13:55] KinarPT: If they had....
[2:14:03] KinarPT: Maybe they were more aware of some stuff
[2:14:11] shooxcarrypotter: do u ever cast revjunation on some Bosses or trash ? is there anytime its good to cast ?
[2:14:16] gambleragain: its sad cause pvp gets the same treatment but worse
[2:14:58] Whitewolf1441: do not enough people run m+ for them to care?
[2:15:00] KinarPT: We need JB back at MDI Top level
[2:15:03] KinarPT: MDI misses JB
[2:15:18] gambleragain: weird they do that to M+, cause i think its the biggest time filler in the game outside of raiding
[2:16:53] bonez89: thats our guild pretty much. just   clear heroic each week and mainly M+
[2:16:54] gambleragain: even trinkets show up as myth in the vault from just raiding HC
[2:17:10] WowGrandma78: Mythic + gives you as good as gear as raid, you have to wait for a piece at a time but if you dont mythic raid its the only way to gear p
[2:17:32] devilhawk83: very true @wowgrandma78
[2:19:07] ardent_iwnl: why verdant tether over allied chest?
[2:19:09] bebincalicious: That feels a bit shit. Not being able to equip max ilvl because of tertiaries
[2:20:00] Whitewolf1441: how do you have so much money
[2:20:09] JeanZM_: Hi @jdotb i want to try play healer wich one you suggest me to start with?
[2:20:30] Phazeback: raid trinkets like the main draw of raiding
[2:20:56] shooxcarrypotter: do u ever cast revjunation on some Bosses or trash ? is there anytime its good to cast ?
[2:21:53] Lalon_93: @shooxcarrypotter are you trolling?
[2:22:04] tr1plus: trinkets are the main difference
[2:22:11] Doom1024: The gearing system for PVE content right now feels like it's in a pretty solid place imo
[2:22:17] tr1plus: but I haven't set foot in anything other than LFR, and I'm doing ~25s
[2:22:58] tr1plus: and I started playing a few weeks late even, so I agree it's pretty good to gear on m+ only
[2:23:00] gambleragain: and honestly i did 2heroics this week on 2 chars and got done with them in 4 hours
[2:23:06] shooxcarrypotter: @lalon_93 Why would i do that ?
[2:23:28] gambleragain: doing heroic raids gives you the chance of myth trinkets
[2:24:05] Phazeback: a lot of the m+ trinkets are better for healing than the raid ones anyways
[2:24:31] WowGrandma78: I prefer raiding but have been forced to M+ and I guess they have grown on me lol.  24s are my  highest though
[2:24:40] devilhawk83: @shooxcarrypotter from what I know, Rejuvenation costs too much mana for what its worth so a lot of Resto druids don‚Äôt bother casting it
[2:24:47] WowGrandma78: Yes for resto druid  BIS is the tyrstone out of Rise
[2:25:00] tr1plus: I think melee DPS (leggo weapon) are the only ones "forced" to to raid atm
[2:25:01] keyda16: Hello all :)
[2:25:57] devilhawk83: chrysLUL I only do the Fyrakk Normal lockouts for my Paladin @tr1plus
[2:26:02] Phazeback: they raid every week just to get disappointed one more time when it doesnt drop
[2:26:23] tr1plus: @devilhawk83 but you still need to go trough the raid. I mean that all other drops you can get strictly from m+
[2:26:39] tr1plus: but yeah, LFR & normal also drop it I guess
[2:26:44] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:26:48] znokfps: jb plays on EU?
[2:27:22] devilhawk83: I want to try to get at least the Normal version of Augury to replace the LFR version of the Augury I got chrysLUL
[2:27:42] ragelius: dreams of augury every week ;)  no chanceXD
[2:27:54] WowGrandma78: I still want the dragon skin from Fyrak  lol
[2:28:16] Phazeback: not to mention people roll on augury just to have people bid for it
[2:28:17] devilhawk83: I got it from my vault a week after LFR Fyrakk dropped chrysLUL
[2:28:25] ragelius: xD
[2:28:44] keyda16: @znokfps Yed
[2:28:46] ragelius: the lootwhoring and selling is kinda f***** up :/
[2:29:21] Phazeback: yeah its very cringe
[2:29:44] devilhawk83: That is the unfortunate thing as you know a lot of people already prepaid for the loot @ragelius
[2:29:50] keyda16: !server

[2:39:36] WowGrandma78: Oh was wondering if it  was my house or yours haha
[2:40:08] keyda16: @WowGrandma78 Same, i was looking around thinking what it was
[2:40:12] nornh: @jdotb thought that was a trumpet lmao
[2:40:15] supzfly: presumed you'd been on the beans, chilli and broccoli diet
[2:40:33] jdotb: we put too much shit on our shelves and it came crashing down in the middle of the night a few months ago
[2:40:35] Phazeback: yeah trumpet was my first thought
[2:40:38] goblingher: @jdotb Thought it was a sub sound or smth
[2:40:47] jdotb: so these dudes are like removing all the old stuff and putting up a bunch of new storage

[2:52:05] Anderine: People at my law school would rip the on point cases out of the reporters so everyone else who got that far would have wasted their time. Rough years.
[2:53:26] goblingher: ARPG is one of the few genre where I go "solo self found" no guides no nothing and see whats what
[2:54:01] WowGrandma78: I been like that in anything i have done in life. Im never satisfied with status quo.
[2:54:28] WowGrandma78: lol
[2:55:10] PapysChulys: Been kinda distancing myself from WoW. Not stopping but, putting less efforts to get higher elo and pushing consistantly for that reason. Was getting mad a lot when keys where not going well and since im working full time, im trying to make my gaming moments more ''fun'' oriented
[2:55:10] pepegpala: Hey @jdotb , i hate my ui , could you upload your interface and wtf folder somewhere ?
[2:55:12] Fizzbot125: How much of that is just because you only have limited amount of time to play games in adulthood, and you don't want to waste your own time? That's how I feel sometimes
[2:55:19] jdotb: !ui

[2:56:53] GoodyGodfather: How goes it today
[2:57:03] Woood: agreed. why play a game if I can't no life it?!
[2:57:25] gripps22: There's enjoyment to be found in learning a spec, rotation, or game at a high level rather than just "free playing." Definitely depends on the person and the former tends to have much more burnout than the latter
[2:57:44] Latexion: yoo weird and deep question. what would you play if there was no world of warcraft no moreüòÅ
[2:58:14] shadowkattey: hello i was wondering are you doing the MDI this season

[3:12:19] WowGrandma78: from the t rading post
[3:12:28] Vixizfx: That is the other rocket
[3:12:33] Nico_vdM: the love rocket from love is in the air
[3:12:40] Whitewolf1441: i was so surprised you said you didnt farm mounts and this one is ultra rare
[3:13:10] ren0m: How's IO score?
[3:13:14] Nico_vdM: The touring rocket is cheap which is nice
[3:13:14] ren0m: Any closer to 3.8?
[3:14:45] Whitewolf1441: haha sorry to bother you again but can i take a peek at your talents rq
[3:14:48] ren0m: Do +20 dungeons drop the highest iLvL gear or do the drops scale above 20?
[3:14:52] EriktheRed27: EriktheRed27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:15:02] ren0m: I mean does +25 drop higher iLvL gear than +20
[3:15:24] Nico_vdM: +20 is max
[3:15:41] frankieg2010: you just have a higher chance to get MORE pieces after 20
[3:15:47] ren0m: Cheers
[3:15:49] Sokchoy: and yet people do higher than 20 i wonder why
[3:15:55] whiskeyhide: for fun
[3:16:00] ren0m: higher chance? @frankieg2010
[3:16:15] eb_farnum: @Sokchoy because it's there
[3:16:20] theBroHam: yeah you can get 3 pieces of loot
[3:16:22] GoodyGodfather: KEKW
[3:16:32] devilhawk83: bragging rights chrysSipsTea
[3:16:32] Spritesgud: finally got a group of people together for a little "team" where we're able to do some solid keys a week, got 3.1k for the first time ever. I know t's nothing crazy but a good start for my first season doing m+ semi serious
[3:16:33] GoodyGodfather: GO OFF KING
[3:16:38] Sokchoy: oh theres a trinket on tindral did you know that
[3:16:40] Sokchoy: its good for dps
[3:16:42] frankieg2010: some percent increase per key level to get an additional piece of gear
[3:16:42] Sokchoy: also one on fyrakk
[3:16:49] ren0m: Ah
[3:16:52] ren0m: I didn't know that
[3:17:03] GoodyGodfather: Who wants a free tier piece
[3:17:04] GoodyGodfather: not me
[3:17:04] Sokchoy: i want the trinket
[3:17:09] gaybingus69: tank trinket :)
[3:17:13] GoodyGodfather: or some baller trinket
[3:17:30] Sokchoy: look up sokchoy gear hes wearing normal ilvl blossom
[3:17:30] Spritesgud: im a fire mage I want his trinket XD
[3:17:39] ren0m: I feel attacked
[3:17:39] ScapeeJ: BECAUSE THEY NEED U AND LOVE JB
[3:17:40] sw0ngs: achievement > loot xD
[3:17:41] Whitewolf1441: for the mount
[3:17:45] GoodyGodfather: It doesnt make sense the math aint mathing
[3:17:50] Krenzic: JB the funniest streamer out there, prove me wrong lmao
[3:17:59] wolfdogroi: it's almost as if they are just playing the game
[3:18:28] whiskeyhide: i hate tindral, belorolos drops every kill but my boomkin cant get the stupid red feather xmog
[3:18:31] Sokchoy: yes the ring and trinket
[3:18:56] Sokchoy: leech tier
[3:19:03] lazylad02: signet
[3:19:11] Sokchoy: rings good for holy too
[3:19:37] Sokchoy: tbf im quite undergeared lmao
[3:19:41] proghunt: jb most handsome eboy on wow s tier
[3:20:05] Sokchoy: just acquire a tank
[3:20:15] whiskeyhide: just go to the tank store
[3:20:21] majestictaco0: +30 looking for new tank, also we have a dev voker
[3:20:25] Whitewolf1441: lmao
[3:20:45] lazylad02: new matter for X
[3:20:46] typ2diabeedus73: owned
[3:20:55] ren0m: You should /w them that JB
[3:21:01] ren0m: Let them know!
[3:21:29] jeppsont: +30 lf 4 player
[3:21:38] theBroHam: "+30 loosely associated individuals looking for tank to form team"
[3:22:13] lazylad02: ur birdie is tired
[3:23:12] max____09: hi
[3:23:19] menzlo: Zaelia feral
[3:23:25] typ2diabeedus73: that level are the keys like 23?
[3:23:39] hisagi1997: meaning that a Tank cannot look for a +30 team, because it doesn't exist
[3:23:42] theBroHam: divine and skylark have pretty good teams
[3:23:44] sw0ngs: yea hes not going aug
[3:23:49] flawlesslykun: i kinda want to fuck with feral too but ik nobody will invite KEKW
[3:23:59] Sokchoy: wish you could choose to hide all the keys lower than the highest key a specific group timed
[3:24:01] flawlesslykun: it is actualy so fun to play
[3:24:06] menzlo: Because tyran or off healing idk
[3:25:02] Blastz_99: there's a teams tab
[3:25:36] VacaSlamBang: no healer diff KEKW
[3:26:01] VacaSlamBang: echo is echo tho cant rly compare
[3:26:18] flowerpwrxd: is it allowed to play in the cup without a healer?
[3:26:23] theBroHam: the EB times blow my mind
[3:26:36] VacaSlamBang: @flowerpwrxd yes, its not allowed to stack specs
[3:27:00] menzlo: Wonder if there's tech
[3:27:05] Sokchoy: do you think they need gear from those 23s
[3:27:29] theBroHam: it's on Tournament realm, they get any gear they want
[3:27:32] flowerpwrxd: @Sokchoy that's why they are doing them so fast, to get the trinket faster
[3:28:29] Sokchoy: that makes sense
[3:29:02] Oracle_WoW: first pull has to be on tree boss trash that spawns it
[3:29:05] Sokchoy: you can also pull 2nd boss onto third boss
[3:30:28] MelipnosTV: 7 pulls sounds like it would be more than 10 minutes maybe?
[3:30:30] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:30:44] ren0m: JB, do you have any plans on live viewing MDI?
[3:31:23] Discpic: less than 2mins per boss
[3:31:59] cloudberrylive: i guess pulling tree out of his boss room isnt kosher for MDI
[3:32:17] MelipnosTV: gonna be cool to see it
[3:33:00] ottomr1990: they basically allow anything during time trials. also I thought they fixed pulling boss out of room anyways
[3:33:29] MelipnosTV: Ah, I thought MDI would be lower lvl keys since we have TGP for high keys anyway
[3:33:33] VacaSlamBang: tbh those key levels are fine for MDI format
[3:33:45] Varthar: isn‚Äôt that the point of mdi
[3:33:52] VacaSlamBang: like if you get them up to 28-29 for speedrunning format it would just be stale
[3:34:16] cloudberrylive: there are like 10 EBs at 29 on tyrannical timed worldwide right? those 29s in LFG always look like cope
[3:34:40] JackBurton176: Why do you run tott so much?
[3:34:51] VacaSlamBang: it was bursting aswell btw, which makes it weirder than it is KEKW
[3:35:13] JukeboxHey: What is next week affixes?
[3:35:18] Kryous: Blizzard will just add a rule that you have to have a healer, right? Like what they did with double same class for DPS.
[3:35:20] JukeboxHey: Is pausechamp week
[3:36:05] Nonyamuff: May try to Hpriest back into M+ this week. Usually stop when hit KSM...but I'm bored lol
[3:36:30] Intra_TV: !playlist
[3:37:02] PaiCansado: what are you enjoying healing most lately, rdruid or mw?
[3:37:09] sw0ngs: he sno longer mia?
[3:38:54] menzlo: They were NAs last hope last time
[3:39:39] ren0m: Wait there's a 260k prize pool for trials?
[3:40:27] theBroHam: for the whole tournie
[3:40:54] JackBurton176: maybe mindgames
[3:41:24] ren0m: @theBroHam makes more sense :D
[3:41:38] AmirMajico: !playlist
[3:41:45] AmirMajico: !music
[3:41:52] JackBurton176: they could be publishing low times to make people feel confident?
[3:41:55] JukeboxHey: We are worse then you Mindgames KEKW
[3:42:21] ren0m: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-4Llphj-VA @AmirMajico
[3:42:40] Kryous: Does time effect seating? Like are people trying to not be in the same group as Echo right off?
[3:42:42] theBroHam: Echo usually does just enough in trials and then pulls out the real crazy stuff during the bracket play
[3:43:27] JackBurton176: and if they are seated with "normies" they will smurf and beat others in the tournament. Just like the kansas city football team was absolute dog water in 2014 and sucked up all the best rookies and now are the best.
[3:43:53] Asthorcolour: It is also a PVE game, like you run your route, who you compete with probably doesn't change your route massively?
[3:44:07] Sorr08: When does the time trial end?
[3:44:15] TanaseDragos: !mdi
[3:44:43] healapotamus: is GG in it?
[3:44:54] buzswagyo: why is mastery so low on prio for r druids
[3:45:07] Whitewolf1441: jb how have you accumulated so much wealth
[3:45:25] Asthorcolour: Instead of such a silly key with sillu one shots you get to do Fyrakk mythic :p
[3:46:05] JackBurton176: upgrading heirlooms is hella expensive
[3:46:08] sw0ngs: you boost? guild raiding?
[3:47:46] Whitewolf1441: you gotta memorize every spell
[3:48:38] Whitewolf1441: ah good point
[3:49:06] JackBurton176: what is your keybind for cure / dispell?
[3:49:33] Leoj151: this week is a push week in the sense that it's pushing me to dislike my M+ friends when we can't time 26s
[3:50:37] JackBurton176: what heals do you put on nomod tilde, tab, z, q, and e.
[3:51:18] JackBurton176: thx
[3:51:32] sirfrax: so for beginners/newbies its good with some extra mastery?
[3:51:33] kelly_mac06: ah still raiding
[3:51:35] WowGrandma78: it's taking a long time to find one thats for sure lol
[3:51:38] youngmulababy: are u streaming raid
[3:51:51] menzlo: All your weekly keys done?
[3:52:33] Whitewolf1441: you dont think 2 levels is a reasonable jump?
[3:53:14] WowGrandma78: each lvl at those levels is a big jump lol
[3:54:19] Leoj151: farming aspects on an alt is the worst thing about this season. would rather watch paint dry
[3:54:57] prestasjon: how does your ads work, is it twitch just playing them for you at a random time? i was interested in what u were taking about, but then over a 1min ad queue showed up and missed ur point
[3:56:20] prestasjon: ok, ty for respond
[3:59:30] KrugsNRoses1: I know this is 100% me but even getting hots on people my Flourish is a wet noodle. Any tips to get the most of it? just make sure a bunch of hots are up? Finding it hard to get the value from it
[4:01:16] imbatiivel: no rejuvenation?
[4:01:20] KrugsNRoses1: ahh gotcha. makes sense to have the soul buffed wild growth
[4:04:28] sheenayy: is boomkin or fmage better PI target?
[4:04:35] sheenayy: in big pulls
[4:04:49] Leoj151: @jdotb as I'm trying to push keys for minimal score gains now in pugs, do you recommend focusing on one key until I time it? or just trying whatever I can find? I probably have a bit more choice as a tank
[4:05:43] turtlesy249: Hey does kittyweaving or boomkinweaving do more dps overall in keys?
[4:05:57] GrimFandango: if you're at that point with pugging, the most gains might come from actually networking and getting good folks from pugs to play together
[4:06:00] Varthar: I focus on like 3-4 dungs any given week, all 8 is a lot I feel like it‚Äôs hard to improve run to run if you only play the same dung once or twice a week
[4:06:10] GrimFandango: @turtlesy249 cat by orders of magnitude
[4:06:36] Vixizfx: opinion on convoke vs tree?
[4:07:09] Ronaldlovecraft: which ones are the convoke dungeons?
[4:07:16] Vixizfx: I'm only @ like 26's but feel like if I wanna progress should be playing tree more
[4:09:16] menzlo: Fall bosses are pretty good to DPS
[4:09:27] Nico_vdM: rise?
[4:09:28] maneatingpotato1: What influences the switch -- healing requirement, timings?
[4:09:53] Ronaldlovecraft: does the armor from tree help for survivability?
[4:11:27] gustavalmer: When you play with convoke, are you playing with x1 budding leaves or reforestation?
[4:12:53] gustavalmer: Thank god, I am really not a fan of the whole reforestation and even tree build...
[4:15:30] Nonyamuff: Sometimes I wish I liked the meta.  I always tend to enjoy the off meta specs lol.
[4:16:03] Vixizfx: @Nonyamuff always been my downfall, never wanted to play what everyone played. I said fk it this season and stuck w/ druid
[4:19:00] KrugsNRoses1: Lmao mic check
[4:19:08] Nonyamuff: Oh my gawd
[4:19:11] kelly_mac06: LOL

[4:20:20] buzswagyo: first season here am i not suposed to replace my crafted pieces
[4:20:33] KrugsNRoses1: haha 5% base mana
[4:22:21] Rastlin: @buzswagyo I think you just upgrade them to max

[4:24:57] kelly_mac06: @buzswagyo they can go to a max of 486, so ye you upgrade
[4:25:03] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:26:36] gwynne23: What do you think the .1% cutoff for keys is going to be? Maybe 3600?
[4:28:17] justbeachi: 3650-3700 is my guess
[4:28:45] justbeachi: but idk think a lot less people are pushing nowadays
[4:28:52] gwynne23: I forgot Jb is also on EU, you guys will have a higher cutoff
[4:29:57] gwynne23: I think the tyrannical keys won't go much higher, 32's look like they may be the hard point
[4:30:42] gwynne23: Fort keys, maybe 32/33 with teams farming for BRH/AD 34s
[4:31:19] Sorr08: Is that a mw I see?
[4:31:50] Nonyamuff: Lmao "new monk"
[4:33:03] uniqueusername7: which key level is this dungeon
[4:33:20] Celissah: Did you get your 28 EB yesterday?

[4:50:31] Krenzic: Kaze^
[4:51:09] Krenzic: Raid leader or Healing officer etc will set up the spreadsheet and it gets imported into the MRT note
[4:51:27] kszunio: i know that, but some ppl are doing additional ones
[4:51:38] kszunio: for example i've seen mages "evocation in 10"
[4:51:44] kszunio: so i doubt its done by leader
[4:54:02] Shkafche: you have also personal note where u can add ur own things in MRT

[5:08:22] 10000watts: idk if i'll ever be at a point where mythic raiding is even feasible, but this definitely seems like the part where it stops being fun and is only frustrating
[5:11:01] Krenzic: Once they get the kill the first time, rekilling will be much easier and getting CE is so worth the struggle.
[5:12:24] Nonyamuff: LEFT SIDE MANY WHELPS....HANDLE IT
[5:14:24] Sokchoy: take it
[5:14:27] Sokchoy: take everything
[5:14:32] Sokchoy: main character energy only
[5:15:28] ShineTheLeo: Does hpriest just slap on this fight? Haven't seen many in the wild
[5:18:09] Cuore22: Hpriest is still very good - Disc timings just work very well for what the raid needs in these fights - so you see less holys.
[5:22:04] somerandomwowguy: Happy raidingday?
[5:22:09] Buffiin: this looks very hard/unpleasant.
[5:25:19] kelly_mac06: it's an interesting fight
[5:25:42] kelly_mac06: very curious how the top end of mythic raiding seemed to love it but no one else does lol
[5:26:59] YouTeeut: next pull for sure
[5:27:56] hadesrebornn: that sounded like kungen
[5:27:57] lllGroovylll: i heard this might get nerfed this week
[5:32:26] YouTeeut: calling in sick has never looked better
[5:38:26] Sokchoy: youre doing great bud no sarcasm
[5:39:24] Kryous: AND you're looking great too. slayyy
[5:39:25] Sokchoy: remember when you were asking for 100 more pulls to practice p1
[5:45:21] Redivna: Are the dispels assigned?
[5:45:34] Webchika: Watching this makes me glad I'm not chasing CE... as it is in Heroic we started running a dispell contest on Fyrakk after a few bad pulls...Healer with the most dispells gets 5k each week
[5:51:01] Snaaade: Hi.. did you manage getting any good keys done today?
[5:51:29] RenchyCC: oh dear, i see gero has joined your guild
[5:59:58] Humpaii: How's prison? @jdotb
[6:00:18] SchmidiGames: Cant wait for this boss to get Halondrus'd
[6:00:32] Bear: You can break out of Fyrakk prison! I believe!
[6:03:03] Bear: good attempt.
[6:03:15] WowGrandma78: So you disc or holy  i stepped away
[6:03:36] WowGrandma78: k
[6:03:53] WowGrandma78: so no druid for this fight  sad face lol
[6:04:22] Bear: Druids do make everything better bhrLove
[6:04:40] WowGrandma78: yes they do dont let anyone tell us otherwise lol
[6:06:20] Bear: this fight is looks like a bullet hell.

[7:04:23] nornh: ayeo we got a mw?
[7:11:58] aiiir_strikes: Swear the fourth  healer is always low hps
[7:19:00] sheckles: @aiiir_strikes healing is a zero sum game there will always be a low healer
[7:19:09] tehonlyninja: don‚Äôt yell PotFriend
[7:19:12] sheckles: because other healers can snipe especially if htey have big bursting heals
[7:19:20] sheckles: yeah that yellingisnt getting better jb
[7:21:00] FinkTV: whats your best % so far?
[7:33:24] andreas_pson: 100% swedish accent on raidleader

[7:37:01] OrieleHS: people bad at catching orbs lol
[7:37:08] OrieleHS: saw like 2-3 of them hit
[7:38:53] OrieleHS: you know as much as I enjoy heroic raiding, you won't catch me pulling a boss 400 times. mythic just isn't worth that
[7:43:29] honeyyyyyy: what are you drinking
[7:44:19] honeyyyyyy: hot take. grape>all other fruit flavors.
[7:45:15] AnarchyMoose: @honeyyyyyy you put the sign backwards, it should be "grape<all other fruit flavors"
[7:45:32] honeyyyyyy: that's certainly a take
[7:45:39] honeyyyyyy: i'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong

[8:08:36] Sokchoy: peepoDJ
