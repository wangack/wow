[0:10:50] Xelthane: Right now I prefer Oldshool runescape as a solo player. But I'll definitely return in the pre-patch of TWW.
[0:11:43] SlithTheSivak: they should copy FF14s ability to allow players to wear glasses AND hats at the same time

[0:13:12] Vaephera: Digs have felt a little more consistent the past couple days but also still have a ton of bugs, and its weird they haven't even mentioned they're looking into it
[0:13:43] CeasiusPls: Tali doing the hard sell lol
[0:13:45] TankenFunk: Sounds like what having a child is like, according to every parent ever tneEvi
[0:14:10] osatox: it aint too rewarding for the general pop tho, but for specific ppl its a grind for reputation, achievements, xmogs
[0:14:28] sanphox: sanphox subscribed with Prime. 
[0:15:06] themummah: let's hope it doesn't reduce to only tired

[0:17:01] Bakayaro88: Also doing it on multiple characters you can just send the 5k currency you get from the weekly to your main, badabing badaboom
[0:17:06] cerywen: i tried to do digs and just stood around waiting for something to happen for 5 minutes, then left.
[0:17:37] Xelthane: Digs feels like archaeology in runescape, but without the dopamine of getting archaeology experience :P
[0:17:44] themummah: i got the godfrey glasses on the first cast
[0:17:45] CrimsonTidalWave: Kappa you don't care about mounts Tali?
[0:18:00] Never2Old2: cheers
[0:18:07] CrimsonTidalWave: Kappa that's interesting cause i don't give a fuck about a mount or training quest
[0:18:12] bettys_dungeon_adventures: @CrimsonTidalWave his hippo is crying in the corner right now
[0:18:22] CrimsonTidalWave: Wanna know what i care about from this fucking IP
[0:18:34] skorvek: The training quests were buggy as heck too.
[0:18:38] CrimsonTidalWave: @bettys_dungeon_adventures which hippo because i know tali as a gladiator
[0:18:56] themummah: i did the same
[0:19:02] bettys_dungeon_adventures: @CrimsonTidalWave the BFA PVP one he was obsessed over for a while
[0:19:25] CrimsonTidalWave: @bettys_dungeon_adventures ok so BFA had the battle raptors and the battle hippo granted, those were iconic series of skins
[0:19:41] CrimsonTidalWave: but i stopped giving a fuck halfway through shadowlands
[0:19:49] CrimsonTidalWave: I'm done with mounts personally
[0:19:56] osatox: so far the WQs have been in either Zaralek Caverns or Ohn'Plains
[0:20:07] Never2Old2: Never2Old2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! tneMug good morning!
[0:20:07] cosmopanda13: I thought more quests would open up every week or at every reputation level kinda disappointed
[0:20:16] meksdh: the patch was underwhelming for sure
[0:20:23] diyreality: i love how mad is the capacitor draenei npc, she properly sounds and acts like that physics proffessor i've seen memes about
[0:20:46] skorvek: Very disappointing, I thought the same
[0:20:59] skorvek: Makes me not want to bother with the rep
[0:21:05] meksdh: I’m guessing most of the team is working on war within. and these last few patches are skeleton crew
[0:21:06] CrimsonTidalWave: I'm not interested in a chair, and skin economy in Blizzard
[0:21:11] CrimsonTidalWave: I want class economy back
[0:21:15] CrimsonTidalWave: I want proffesion economy back
[0:21:19] CrimsonTidalWave: and I want lfg economy back
[0:21:22] CrimsonTidalWave: like wotlk
[0:21:29] CrimsonTidalWave: enough of this new gen shit
[0:21:32] CrimsonTidalWave: they've failed
[0:21:33] Vaephera: Don't worry, at rank 3 and 4... there's still nothing. I'm not really sure why there's even a rep.
[0:21:51] grimblymcgoo: Skin farming was Great in wow when it was something to do after your " chores". I dont play fortnite to get skins, i play fortnite to shot kids in the face. the skins come secondary
[0:21:53] diyreality: @Vaephera do you live there 24/7?
[0:21:58] Vaephera: yes
[0:22:33] CeasiusPls: Those who Loam are never lost - Gandalf
[0:22:51] coolboyjk7: still waiting on that Disco Elysium talks
[0:22:52] neoraptus: the foundation is an amazing show well done
[0:23:01] CrimsonTidalWave: Loam were decent but sequestering it underground that gimmick
[0:23:12] CrimsonTidalWave: Blizzard is becoming a gimmick after so long it's gimmicky
[0:23:13] pumpkin_moon_: i already got the mount from the vendor and a few cosmetics. Its not too bad
[0:23:22] CrimsonTidalWave: shallow updates with no class balance or innovation
[0:23:37] CrimsonTidalWave: non of you wow boys let your wives stream
[0:23:40] themummah: Have you been doing the Outland dragonflying event?
[0:23:41] CrimsonTidalWave: what are you all hiding
[0:23:52] girlfrmmars: Wait, a game I can play on my Mac? Sign me up.
[0:23:53] CrimsonTidalWave: name one wow streamer who let their wife stream
[0:24:00] CrimsonTidalWave: not 1 it's a closed rank... we need mothering
[0:24:03] Singhy: Gary oldman in slow horses reminds me of the detective in disco elysium
[0:24:04] grimblymcgoo: @CrimsonTidalWave Let? you ok my guy?
[0:24:17] Singhy: 👀
[0:24:19] CrimsonTidalWave: @grimblymcgoo think about it tho
[0:24:25] aerissune: Yay! I can watch you for six minutes before I have to adult!

[0:24:42] bettys_dungeon_adventures: adulting is a trap
[0:25:02] XedL: Doing research for TWW Delves
[0:25:47] Amarlian: Steak bets are always fun
[0:25:58] MrScotticus: Definitely news today
[0:26:24] diyreality: shifty eyes intensifies
[0:26:47] Dashric: I swear I don't want it to be pirates at this point.  The community has already burned me out on the idea
[0:27:04] CrimsonTidalWave: gimme the leaks
[0:27:06] CrimsonTidalWave: break it all down
[0:27:46] CrimsonTidalWave: Piracy is one of those things like Blizzard used to do well but we'll see
[0:27:49] CrimsonTidalWave: half of classic was pirates
[0:28:01] Nulgar: you _know_ it is like this, Tali
[0:28:08] CrimsonTidalWave: Vanclef to booty bay

[0:30:20] Wyrmshield: Wait does this mean this will be the first time tali is wrong??
[0:30:23] themummah: lol
[0:30:27] SlithTheSivak: I DESPERATELY want Evi to win
[0:30:32] bettys_dungeon_adventures: same
[0:30:36] CrimsonTidalWave: Is the power of media predictive element in physics
[0:30:43] bettys_dungeon_adventures: Tali in a maid costume for when?
[0:30:44] CrimsonTidalWave: because if tali is right again
[0:30:46] CrimsonTidalWave: I'm so fucking
[0:30:48] CrimsonTidalWave: this is a simulation
[0:30:53] CrimsonTidalWave: I quit
[0:30:59] Nulgar: so, Evi, what will Tali be wearing next time=
[0:30:59] SlithTheSivak: cosplay
[0:31:02] Nulgar: ?
[0:31:05] CrimsonTidalWave: Tali works for blizzard at this point
[0:31:14] CrimsonTidalWave: I'm so sick of his ideas being 99.5% correct
[0:31:30] StraightErro: clown outfit inc.... either one wearing it will be a winner

[0:37:21] Reminii91: do we still have to send it thru the mail to our alts?
[0:37:45] Nulgar: I'm a bit sad we're not getting catchup gear from outdoor content this tier (so far)
[0:37:49] CrimsonTidalWave: thats how they get you
[0:37:51] CrimsonTidalWave: you start 1 task
[0:37:56] CrimsonTidalWave: and now you have 10 more
[0:38:15] CrimsonTidalWave: I can just knock this quest out
[0:38:17] CrimsonTidalWave: next day
[0:38:21] CrimsonTidalWave: i have 10 more quests
[0:38:37] Nulgar: speaking of, a question to British people: is "Flufferdoodle" an appropriate name for a dog?
[0:38:55] stellabellas: !lurk stella517Blink morning, working on work keyboard, love to listen
[0:39:00] Magfaeridon: Does Tali know what a fluffer is or is he just trolling us?
[0:39:03] Tenga66: I was concerned that the fluffer left with Bobby
[0:39:04] influx_404_: It's a real term now?
[0:39:04] Nulgar: nono, fluffing _makes_ hard
[0:39:08] Magfaeridon: Okay, he knows
[0:39:09] Magfaeridon: I got it.
[0:39:18] TankenFunk: I didn't have my fluff up before I turned 25, so yeah, fluff ups are hard!
[0:39:20] MisplacedAlice: Tali adding to the horny XD
[0:39:35] aeson_of_raid_sock: Horny Tali is a menace
[0:39:40] CrimsonTidalWave: play gilneas or upload it to youtube
[0:39:42] Nulgar: Nulgar gifted a Tier 1 sub to MisplacedAlice! They have given 228 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:39:48] CrimsonTidalWave: you tali play gilneas
[0:39:49] XedL: I'm not the Blizzard fluffer, I'm the Blizzard fluffers son...
[0:40:08] Nulgar: @CrimsonTidalWave I think he already played it on stream
[0:40:16] Xelthane: If it was poison, it would be a green background.
[0:40:23] CrimsonTidalWave: @Nulgar i missed it but awesome
[0:40:52] MisplacedAlice: @Nulgar Thank you!
[0:40:52] TankenFunk: See you in 4 hours
[0:41:04] Xelthane: And you aren't allowed to equip anything above lvl 10 gear.
[0:41:36] skorvek: Cover up for tuskar race being added.
[0:41:40] Collected1: it will be fun until wowhead reveal everything LUL
[0:41:44] justmarundo: Hardcore was my first thought as well, but I didn't think more in depth about it at the time.
[0:41:56] Nulgar: Hardcore WoW makes even less sense than Hardcore Classic tneEvi the only people playing that would be, like in Classic, streamers where viewers are watching for them to slip up and die.
[0:41:59] kavejohnson: tuskar pirates!
[0:42:01] aeson_of_raid_sock: goonies patch
[0:42:17] influx_404_: It's about Bobby returning and stealing all your money
[0:42:17] Whezyk_: Any Squalls of the night variety?
[0:42:34] databob1: Mabye they're hiring  Jonny Depp.
[0:42:37] Dynamorh: back before the announcement of the 3 new expansions, Tali guessed that the expansion was going to be a "pirate Theme", this is Bliz just trolling Tali for all the times hes been right and just screwing with him
[0:42:39] Nulgar: @MisplacedAlice you're very welcome frogmu1Heart
[0:42:52] neoraptus: TUSKAR priests!!!
[0:43:32] JimothyOnline: Niffen allied race
[0:44:15] neoraptus: tuskar pirates
[0:46:00] databob1: We need a private eye to find the privateer... DinoDance DinoDance ;)
[0:46:03] Whezyk_: Shiver me timbers...
[0:46:27] diyreality: would be awesome if Wrathion has his phat fingers into that pirate stuff
[0:47:19] Never2Old2: bardLove
[0:47:30] Alonarius: Player Housing in Booty Bay
[0:47:33] diyreality: or tanaris, since it's closer to the what sword
[0:47:37] JoeTheRedcoat: I'd much rather Gadgetzan get that treatment
[0:47:37] justmarundo: Does blizzard have a zshussher as well as a fluffer?
[0:47:46] Zaelsus: Booty Bay's counter-pirate expedition group
[0:47:51] Alonarius: I'd never leave
[0:48:21] lumaday: The nightsquall returns to booty bay!
[0:48:36] SlithTheSivak: I think Gadgetzan would be the place to get the upgrade ala Hearthstone. Would also be a good launching point for the next xpac
[0:48:41] Never2Old2: That would be so much fun booty bay revamp!
[0:49:36] Xelthane: I'd settle for nothing less than my own pirate ship for that rep grind.
[0:51:05] Powhxo: A hunter can use Soggy Mo'arg Eyepatch
[0:51:09] ChristaStarr: awwwwwweeeeesoooomeee
[0:51:10] Arlaeya: My soul needs that now
[0:51:16] Ob1dragonborn: hello friends
[0:51:18] Reminii91: Blizz news drop @TaliesinAndEvitel  employees layoff
[0:51:21] SlithTheSivak: Who wears the dress?!?!?!
[0:51:30] bladestitch: The pathetic section.
[0:51:31] Ob1dragonborn: Ob1dragonborn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:51:31] databob1: Aaaawww... I would dress up special for that.  In game too
[0:51:34] voidmuse: OMG, Our Flag Means Death patch!
[0:51:36] ChristaStarr: screw them
[0:51:46] TankenFunk: Isn't every wedding a war? Cue boomer comic strip
[0:51:49] TankenFunk: tneEvi
[0:52:12] sirhc_knil: Oh we're playing World of Wokecraft now???
[0:52:22] databob1: @tankenfunk  lol
[0:52:25] XedL: Oh, ffs
[0:52:31] MakkitoTV: riot is doing the same
[0:52:37] SlithTheSivak: between the two organizations thats like 30k people
[0:52:43] Nulgar: oof, wasn't this something that wasn't supposed to happen under MS?
[0:52:45] kavejohnson: what'd be pretty neat is after the worldsoul saga or during it, we explore to the west and we discover more titan influenced races within their own experiment on the other side of azeroth
[0:52:55] databob1: Crap
[0:53:04] stuartystu: Why?
[0:53:08] atamala: wonder what all the merger fanboys are thinking now
[0:53:25] Nulgar: @atamala yyyup
[0:53:30] TankenFunk: @Nulgar Yeah, only evil supervillain actiblizz would do such a thing. Based Microsoft would never
[0:53:33] codicier: "execution plan" ....
[0:53:34] UJackwagon: "execution plan"
[0:53:49] vlaovich88: Soooo the total opposite they claimed would happen?
[0:53:58] Nulgar: companies aren't bonsais
[0:54:07] Co1eCash: The good old, addition by subtraction…..
[0:54:09] Deatheran: finacialization of companies...
[0:54:34] ArcaneSyntax: They were always gonna fire a ton of people because any time this shit happens there's a ton of redundant jobs now.
[0:54:34] Rolaz: 900 people, when blizzard need more people so they can create World Saga faster
[0:54:44] databob1: Wow good thing we got rid of Bobby... nothing bad will ever happen now that we got rid of Bobby
[0:56:24] atamala: it makes sense if it's HR, finance, etc because that can be managed by MS at a different level but if it's game dev then it's hard to understand
[0:56:24] ArcaneSyntax: @rolaz we have no idea if any of these layoffs are actually on the wow team.
[0:56:40] shych00: I think something similar happened at Riot earlier this week
[0:56:53] themummah: Well if it affects the game then they will be making a loss as Wow players are already at a point where they don't need much reason to drop it
[0:57:16] Singhy: Is that what the school and crossbones stands for?
[0:57:26] Deatheran: i guess it would make sense if the layoffs are mostly redundant departments, that was expected. microsoft has an HR department
[0:57:41] dreadcookie19: 10,000 layoffs from Microsoft already this month....
[0:57:41] ArcaneSyntax: Activision Blizzard was like 20,000 people or something, it could not even be at blizzard at all
[0:57:57] Amarlian: But do you think they feel better that they are getting laid off to create shareholder value? /s
[0:58:04] Sarkans41: oh, its Evitel, the real star of this show
[0:58:12] Marach: I'd honestly guess HR and accounting are the 2 main areas
[0:58:16] Magfaeridon: Lighten the mood with more "Fluffing"
[0:58:41] GoldSmog: I swear it seems like companies just do it because others have. Riot just had layoffs too
[0:59:07] Deatheran: @Amarlian not even a litle bit. i think shareholder capitalism is going to be at fault for the end of us
[0:59:12] Sarkans41: @Marach They're probably targeting administrative redundancies across the board resulting from the merger.  So you're probably not far off.
[0:59:30] Sarkans41: Genn is a gonner
[0:59:43] Deatheran: @GoldSmog welcome to tech industry 101, "google is laying off 20% of its staff, when are we?"
[0:59:45] Sarkans41: or Genn is going pirating
[0:59:54] ArcaneSyntax: 10.2.6 and obviously it's player housing.
[0:59:57] TankenFunk: Patch 10.2.6: Death of the Dragon Queen
[1:00:01] TankenFunk: tneEvi
[1:00:11] XedL: Pirate Captain Nathanos!
[1:00:23] themummah: lol
[1:00:33] Sarkans41: @GoldSmog It is because they're all bracing for a "recession" analysts told them was coming so they do their darnedest to make it happen.  CEOs are often not the smartest people in the room
[1:00:39] Singhy: the “timeline” dies
[1:00:40] Marach: @Sarkans41 yeah HR, accounting and possibly the IT guys wouldn't be surprised if that covers 80% of them
[1:00:47] TankenFunk: Maybe it's a skull because we all die and they're sending us back to the Shadowlands tneEvi
[1:01:19] themummah: and then tell us it was always going to be this way
[1:01:48] Zaelsus: Skull and crossbones = "Here be dungeons" LUL
[1:01:50] XedL: Mini-raid maybe? That could be fun
[1:02:05] ArcaneSyntax: The skull refers to community reaction when they buff ret again
[1:02:06] Singhy: gen dies
[1:02:07] MrBrightside1: a pirate mini raid would be fun
[1:02:10] Bakayaro88: Hear me out, what about the fact that STV in SoD will have an event and its Blood Sail Buccaneer related and what IF they will do a similar event in Retail, its piratey etc whats your thoughts?
[1:02:24] Deatheran: what if they made "vault of dragonflight" a linear raid of like 3 or 4 bosses that can be rotated in and out for fated Pog
[1:02:42] Sarkans41: theyre refreshing factions and groups form the old world in prep for our return
[1:02:44] TankenFunk: I hope we get a taste of the coming of the great intergalactic disco war before TWW. I miss it
[1:02:55] Pixelspass: Pixelspass subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:02:55] Sujis: there is youtube too? curse those bastards
[1:02:56] codicier: was mike ybarra leaving announced/known before today?
[1:03:35] Zaelsus: He just tweeted about the layoffs
[1:03:42] Dred_Scythe: ***
[1:03:42] Sarkans41: 52 sec ago he just tweeted hes leaving
[1:03:43] Zaelsus: (Mike I mean)
[1:03:49] TankenFunk: Steve? Kappa
[1:04:06] themummah: 1 minute ago announcement
[1:04:11] Sujis: honestly ian is too good for us
[1:04:11] XedL: Their survival game has been cancelled too according to Tom Warren's twitter
[1:04:19] magemaster225: survival game axed too
[1:04:19] Nontus135: Mike Ybarra tweet confirms
[1:04:31] databob1: Mike tweeted he's leaving
[1:04:49] diyreality: maybe the 900 are part of the survival game?
[1:05:15] Sarkans41: 1900 employees between activision blizzard AND xbox
[1:05:15] Marach: Ybarra feels like he was there to get Blizz ready for the purchase.
[1:05:23] Sarkans41: definitely a merger thing its normal
[1:05:37] themummah: At least he had a heads up. Cos pretty sure a boss knows what's coming
[1:05:38] XedL: I clipped it on Twitch for you Tali
[1:05:41] mrpahitice: do we have any SOD news?
[1:06:00] Reminii91: THANKS ELON
[1:06:03] Sujis: Lol good try Evi
[1:06:11] databob1: It still sucks even if it is normal
[1:06:22] Holicu: just news
[1:06:27] aeson_of_raid_sock: survival game got axed
[1:06:30] Hotstitute: Metzan
[1:06:38] themummah: Dad's Army
[1:06:52] Singhy: palworld of Warcraft
[1:07:03] aeson_of_raid_sock: the verge
[1:07:14] aeson_of_raid_sock: they have the article
[1:07:19] themummah: Palworld is actually good though and not broken
[1:07:29] crammus: damn :(
[1:07:31] bettys_dungeon_adventures: its more like WoW is the palworld of MMORPGs
[1:07:45] Sujis: That really sucks
[1:07:53] databob1: GOD DAMN IT I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT!!!!
[1:08:01] Hotstitute: Look at The Verge Twitter
[1:08:07] crammus: thank goodness microsoft bought them...
[1:08:35] dierdrew0lf: Well now I feel like 10.2.6 will def be released on the PTR/Announced to kinda make up for all this bad news.
[1:08:36] themummah: I think we all knew MS were going to flip things on their head
[1:08:36] Nulgar: ah fuck
[1:08:39] Nulgar: that's bad
[1:08:44] XedL: "No news today fam, what shall we talk about?" *Monkey's paw curls*
[1:08:49] GameingAspect: project titan there been mention of tht for years
[1:08:51] KrathiumWoW: I wonder if the assets will be used for other blizz games like WoW?
[1:09:08] Hotstitute: WoW is the cash cow
[1:09:24] grimblymcgoo: @Hotstitute Candy Crush is the cash cow
[1:09:46] Singhy: call of duty too
[1:09:48] Hotstitute: @grimblymcgoo for the blizzard brand, its the cash cow, not for king, king is now part of microsoft
[1:09:54] themummah: IS it always going to be there?
[1:10:03] themummah: only if it is good
[1:10:08] grimblymcgoo: @grimblymcgoo So is acti/blizz
[1:10:10] DestyIzMe: The only thing that will kill wow is blizzard
[1:10:16] Toiarc: Blizzard employees: "Yes! Finally someone bought our firm." Instantly lays off 1900 people :<
[1:10:20] grimblymcgoo: @grimblymcgoo They bought the cash cow, the other stuff came with
[1:10:24] Sorin__: It's still here after shadowlands
[1:10:32] DestyIzMe: players are gonna ride or die wow until blizzard buries it
[1:10:36] Hotstitute: @Sorin__ WoD was much worse
[1:10:47] Bakayaro88: It is what we call in business world a Cash Cow
[1:11:10] Singhy: then it goes to static
[1:11:45] Hotstitute: Mike Ybarra left Microsoft already didnt he?
[1:12:00] Sarkans41: @Toiarc Mergers create redundancies unfortunately.
[1:12:04] databob1: Now we know what the skull and cross bones are...Microsoft pillaging  Blizzard
[1:12:13] ArcaneSyntax: Does Mike Ybara count as one of the 1900
[1:12:19] mrpahitice: do we have any SOD Updates?
[1:12:23] Vaephera: Allen Adham also leaving - one of the original founders and chief design officer, although he had a 12 year gap away from blizz
[1:12:33] xSpartan051x: SOD is cancelled
[1:12:35] Sarkans41: @ArcaneSyntax doubful at his level you dont get laid off, you "retire"
[1:12:36] Hotstitute: @ArcaneSyntax he probably does, but if he doesnt it shows a character moment
[1:12:43] xSpartan051x: that’s fake news lol don’t listen to me
[1:12:53] Toketems: I mean whatever it is what it is
[1:12:55] mrpahitice: @xSpartan051x no shit xD
[1:13:17] Toketems: shit happens
[1:13:20] Tbizz_01: So many of these company’s laying off their devs… AI stepping in?
[1:13:32] Bakayaro88: Hear me out on the cross and bones; what about the fact that STV in SoD will have an event, and it could be  Blood Sail Buccaneer related? What IF they will do a similar event in Retail, its pirates, etc? What are your thoughts?
[1:13:47] Sarkans41: @Tbizz_01 AI is nowhere close to replacing employees for anything more than the most repetative tasks
[1:13:52] Hotstitute: clothes hopefully
[1:14:00] Toketems: but gib me a pirate wedding
[1:14:01] XedL: Full Scottish Widows stylee?
[1:14:05] Sorin__: Yeah this week is looking unlikely
[1:14:07] DestyIzMe: Ai plays a small part in some of it.  But most of these companies were mass hiring during pandemic and now can no longer support those positions
[1:14:15] mrswellrested: wait I just got here what did I miss?
[1:14:22] Hotstitute: if there is no annoucnement, Weekly reset just have evi coming onto screen in pirate attire then walking off sad
[1:14:31] Sarkans41: @mrswellrested Ybarra out, 1900 laid off between BLizz and xbox
[1:14:31] Zaelsus: If anything, the search for WoW news ended up being a monkey's paw situation @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:14:31] bettys_dungeon_adventures: @mrswellrested layoffs at blizz
[1:14:45] mrswellrested: @Sarkans41 oof
[1:15:16] Sarkans41: @mrswellrested not really unexpected if you know anything about mergers and acquisitions.  Redundancies get created so they try to move around those they can and in the end you have to lay off
[1:16:30] Jynt334: It's like Undertale
[1:16:30] KulMital: mike ybarra leaving blizz? is this old news?
[1:16:43] Hotstitute: a bullet hell game is basically the old school games with the planes
[1:16:44] Nontus135: 10 minute old news lol
[1:16:53] Singhy: space invaders on steroids
[1:17:18] Deatheran: the average day as a woman on the internet
[1:17:19] Deatheran: LOL
[1:17:24] Tbizz_01: Can we get a gif of these Tali dodge dances
[1:17:34] Hotstitute: wouldnt take anyones opinion on asmongold serious, they are usually 17yr old kids
[1:17:35] justmarundo: can be both
[1:17:36] Alonarius: Reverse-bullet hell is Ion tweeting then?
[1:17:38] n00batplay: ikaruga <3
[1:17:54] justmarundo: exactly
[1:17:54] Piddleton: That's exactly it.
[1:17:59] Nice_n_Dicey: vampire suvivors is awesome
[1:18:07] Piddleton: You shoot all the screen. It is very fun.
[1:18:09] Nulgar: podcast listeners will love this part tneEvi
[1:18:23] Sorin__: I think they call it an auto shooter, you just have to move
[1:18:37] OGaxelaw: wasnt 1984 a bullet hell game. that would be the first i remember
[1:18:38] justmarundo: Pirate Survivors?
[1:18:44] Zaelsus: Upgrades makes thing go even wilder as the game goes on
[1:18:51] Hotstitute: @OGaxelaw basically yeah
[1:18:55] justmarundo: Vam-Pirate... ok, I'll go away
[1:19:27] plaguedot: hi awesome @TaliesinAndEvitel how are you ? TwitchUnity imGlitch FallWinning
[1:19:29] Hotstitute: what if its IN the patch, nobody has found it yet?.. TO THE SECRETS DISCORD
[1:19:35] Ckraigfriend: there is 2 new quest with cinematic on na
[1:19:36] Nulgar: tbh would not be good in an online game, ping is a huge factor
[1:19:40] Nontus135: Why would they use the title of another game??? It's just weird to use a game title.
[1:19:43] aeson_of_raid_sock: island expeditions but bullet hell
[1:19:52] RatmanForever: bullet hell is enemies all shooting crazy amounts of shots at you. Reverse is you shooting a screen full of bullets at enemies automatically, you just control your character's movement. Worth noting that It's occasionally also called a "Bullet Heaven"
[1:20:02] Alonarius: Various Animated Mobs Pir-ates
[1:20:17] sable_64: @Nontus135 for familiarity
[1:20:48] SlithTheSivak: Could this open the door for Michael Morhaime to return as CEO?!
[1:20:48] Sarkans41: absolutely a experiment
[1:20:52] Piddleton: There are no vampires.
[1:20:53] Sarkans41: an
[1:20:55] OGaxelaw: songflower zombie mini game worked
[1:21:25] Sarkans41: @SlithTheSivak probably not, depending on how the merger was done there may not be a "CEO" of blizz like we knew it.
[1:21:26] nerd14nerd: does he know about the layoffs?
[1:21:33] Hotstitute: @SlithTheSivak has his own company
[1:21:35] mrpahitice: QA
[1:21:35] Co1eCash: Most of the sprites are straight from Castlevania SotN
[1:21:38] Nulgar: @nerd14nerd we talked about them earlier, yes
[1:21:40] Sarkans41: @nerd14nerd already talked about it
[1:21:44] nerd14nerd: thanks
[1:21:44] Co1eCash: Hence the vampires?
[1:21:54] Bears_Adventures: Lol
[1:21:57] Bears_Adventures: Love it!

[1:22:22] Waikikamukau: Tali isn't having any of that
[1:22:22] cyclopsnerd: vamp- conquistadors
[1:22:24] SlithTheSivak: @themummah hes creative lead already but ur right
[1:22:24] Nontus135: VAM-PIRATE
[1:22:25] sirhc_knil: The moment Evi became a single mom

[1:22:42] SirNarks: pattyHelping
[1:22:44] Sujis: Stop being a downer Tali, it’s perfect!
[1:22:46] Tbizz_01: tneWowkiller
[1:22:55] meercatsdot: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think it will be a mini game like plants vs zombies
[1:22:56] aeson_of_raid_sock: make her wear a hot dog costume
[1:23:03] Bears_Adventures: bearsa9Giggle bearsa9Giggle bearsa9Giggle
[1:23:11] Ryai: LUL LUL
[1:23:20] OGaxelaw: baby outfit with a bottle
[1:23:21] Hotstitute: YARGHHHH, I WANT TO SUCK YOUR BLOOD
[1:23:22] sable_64: Ok nightsquall right? Night? like vampires are active at night? Vampirates confirmed
[1:24:02] themummah: Picturing Denathrius with a tricorn and a thong now
[1:24:04] OGaxelaw: what if you had her dress up as a zombie pirate survivor
[1:24:08] SlithTheSivak: shed also need a fursuit
[1:24:11] Sujis: what kind of version of the movie have you seen Tali? KappaHD
[1:24:12] ArcaneSyntax: Ewoks are known shirtcockers
[1:24:28] vlaovich88: Think we will need a different platform for the next podcast haha
[1:24:45] Discordant_Hats: San'layn Survivors, oc do not steal
[1:24:50] Hotstitute: 10.2.7 TimeRunning PandAmonium?.. Siege of Org? :O
[1:25:05] pigg50: Hats and vests
[1:26:00] Nulgar: Li Li razwicLili
[1:26:08] Sarkans41: Li Li makes me wanna go play hots again
[1:26:09] Hotstitute: Data mined weapons from siege mentioned in July implies it involves Siege of Org as the timewalking raid for a month or 2 :D
[1:26:23] majkana: Really scared that they are gonna  layoff Holly and Chris. If they can let Ybarra go no one seemse to be safe
[1:26:48] Hotstitute: what if!.. the time running aspect is like the chromie dodge mini game during DF story
[1:27:02] grimblymcgoo: @majkana president of a company that is absorbed is a lot easier to get rid of then produccers
[1:27:07] ArcaneSyntax: Y'all are old
[1:27:26] grimblymcgoo: @majkana not saying youre wrong
[1:27:29] sable_64: @majkana idk if they can let Chris and Holly go. both of them are basically helping revitalize WoW rn
[1:27:30] OGaxelaw: songflower zombie mini game came out in like pandaria so it doesnt really have to have anything to do with the expansion or current stuff
[1:27:34] Tbizz_01: is this the way of doing the chromie time we wanted. quests and follower dungeons/raids to tell the whole story of the exp?
[1:27:35] Mr_Mannis: @TaliesinAndEvitel Gilneas reclamation left me unsatisfied, it was too short. I expected a better conclusion after so many years of waiting :(
[1:27:48] girlfrmmars: Hate ad breaks interrupting, but when they feature Idris Alba...
[1:28:00] majkana: @grimblymcgoo Hope so, TBH Could not care THAT much about Ybarra, but as you and others said, Chris and Holly seemse SOOO important for the game that i used got a bad feeling
[1:28:00] Hotstitute: Im 1000% convinced that the garrosh fight will be changed, and xal'atath will show up and suck on the heart a little
[1:28:13] Nulgar: Nulgar gifted a Tier 1 sub to girlfrmmars! They have given 229 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:28:15] Tbizz_01: @mr_mannis maybe they’re setting it up for gilnaes player housing

[1:30:04] Nulgar: he was selected to choose
[1:30:18] Singhy: quit or get fired
[1:30:18] Hotstitute: maybe he got told he has to fire 1900, and he didnt want to, so he quit
[1:30:24] majkana: @TaliesinAndEvitel who would you be most upset over if they got laidoff?
[1:30:28] gooseberrypies: yarrBongos yarrBongos yarrBongos

[1:30:48] Amarlian: He want's that stream privilege not that president privilege for M+ @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:30:50] nathan_melton: Wait did he actually leave?
[1:30:52] LeftyReb: yesterday Microsoft posted record profit ns value of almost 3 trillion
[1:31:04] Wyrmshield: Is he actually gone? Danuser?
[1:31:13] butlerlog: @gryffiest he hasn't been mentioned in ages and wasn't at blizzcon
