The fact he has that much juice at blizzard that he can be a fraud and pretend he knows PVP to get gigs like this is a shame. I hope this guy realizes the best thing for pvp would be to get rid of him commentating on it.. not only is his appearance unprofessional (that hair.. really? it's 2017).. but he is clueless.
