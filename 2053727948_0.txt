[0:05:55] BlueStorm91: don't think totem scripts should be allowed tho
[0:06:23] Swishinn: do you think warrior would be a better fit than dk against rps?
[0:06:30] chartwellk: super proud of liquid for the second place.  thanks for entertaining the questions.  you are the healer god!
[0:06:31] ttvbarely_average: good games today cdew. you guys still kicked ass and i wish i could be half the player you guys are

[0:07:21] GaryNec: No offense dude u shouldnt be mad or upset u played well u won last time u cant win them all
[0:07:21] stipgaming: Everyone accusing wizk of cheating.
[0:07:24] Sleepysevenz: i mean he killed the totem before you could even see it
[0:07:31] zenjj2161: That Beard/Hair Is Fucking Legendary!!
[0:07:49] Swishinn: can you make a macro for spells to prioritize a totem or something if its out?
[0:07:52] coachingpotatoes: wasn't that totem kill some weak aura thingie
[0:07:54] DeepxLogic: @stipgaming Like who
[0:07:57] Poopiepants: That doesnt matter, they won that game anyways
[0:07:57] pattymeltx: We gonna see the WW Sub?
[0:07:59] xPraddaG: I honestly thought y'all were gonna lock in cleave on Hook Point.
[0:08:07] Daydash_Gaming: did you ever consider swapping to a diff heal class?
[0:08:09] Swishinn: like some kinda target macro in his death or something
[0:08:11] chartwellk: wowpvp reddit is going to deep dive the wizk script macro lol
[0:08:12] likehisname: still vwp cdew!
[0:08:13] morgraz: if any team is gonna be able to count liquid its gonna be the move
[0:08:17] Zoortha: is it possible to preshot the totem with a macro ?
[0:08:25] c10starburst: warrior DH would of been cool
[0:08:36] BlueStorm91: default macros cannot target specific totems
[0:08:43] KaskaTV: did they cut the amount of cups  & prize pool?
[0:08:45] chartwellk: seeing WW do well in EU, will you bring back a WW cleave?
[0:08:51] Daydash_Gaming: did you ever consider swapping healers?
[0:09:09] Daydash_Gaming: or diff heal class to put it better

[0:10:58] Daydash_Gaming: how come you seemed to not wanna use link? or you held off on it pretty long
[0:10:58] chartwellk: LEGEND
[0:10:58] Decius_Avitus: is it true that EU 2700 = NA 1800?
[0:10:58] c10starburst: lol

[0:11:09] chaosemperor77: eu was actually entertaining today also
[0:11:10] Druid_Neminus: Do it for 10k lol
[0:11:13] jasonkbkt: Kinda crazy those links died before they were even visible
[0:11:16] ChumpkinM: I think it was the killing of the spirit link. I am noob, could that be just a macro?
[0:11:17] Necrootide: Even though it was not the best result not a bad spot to start! You got 1st next session. Loved to see you and the team playing well
[0:11:23] Intravz: damn bro, thats brutal
[0:11:25] odinson2410: what did cass say about the new cut?
[0:11:25] Poopiepants: Pika fighting clone city
[0:11:26] Jcres54: id have to say, over the years your guys total record against the move has to be pretty close lol
[0:11:30] J_war_: pika sititng in clones a lot more tbh
[0:11:30] kakichoco: oh the sub ww was clean!
[0:11:38] Halt57: @Daydash_Gaming if he trinketed to link there, he can just get silenced by wiz. had to wait the fear. if thats the one u were talking about
[0:11:39] Magottx: nice work today Dewski. you the man
[0:11:43] GadgetCopter: he said it's a mouseover
[0:11:46] nikthevoker: you could realy notice the hair when the light went down LULL
[0:11:48] KaskaTV: its not responsive, so he could see the name plate before it actually registers
[0:11:52] tavdad: wtf
[0:11:53] ogkoop: Ya it feels like a full global later sometimes
[0:11:53] c10starburst: ya
[0:11:54] buffevoker: EU Windwalker was crazy player that man did dam
[0:11:59] pharmztko: yep
[0:12:02] c10starburst: so bad
[0:12:06] nrdoubleu: I think wiz is just great at reading the situation and knowing when you’ll trink/link

[0:12:22] ogkoop: MrDestructoid
[0:12:24] socbrotes: great games dew
[0:12:30] ChumpkinM: There was one time the link totem died in 1 frame. They wanted the replay 10 time to catch it.
[0:12:32] Eradivyn: what the fuck happened
[0:12:38] bmillybmilly: does it pop that you did it on any addons before it is down?
[0:12:38] Eradivyn: YO WHERE IS YOUR HAIR
[0:12:40] Zonnis: so what he’s just holding globals and waiting for the totem
[0:12:40] mavy123456: @cdewx please please find it within yourself to rip your shirt off to display dominance
[0:12:41] jasonkbkt: Was surprised you didn't send the pres
[0:12:42] jacob_the_mage: Bro he killed the totem before it even spawned.... like a butterfly dying WHILE in the cocoon still... sus asf
[0:12:53] frikaboy: He said in his stream that he was channeling VT hovering for the link and then swp it
[0:12:59] terranapart: @cdewx dewYo GGs today man!
[0:13:01] Druid_Neminus: They did
[0:13:01] Timeless_jg: the games felt very solid at first what happened?
[0:13:08] addyz0r: ggwp
[0:13:09] nikthevoker: they had to oput it on mega ultra slow mode
[0:13:12] papagoog: do you think your new beard and hair cut impedes your gaming
[0:13:15] ttvbarely_average: @cdewx what did the wife say on the new style?
[0:13:22] AragonoTV: gg'S TODAY BROTHER, wHAT A show!! tHANKS
[0:13:27] addyz0r: casters used almost 5mins trying to figure it ou
[0:13:28] addyz0r: t
[0:13:28] novaspectv: did you lose a bet or something?
[0:13:31] Druid_Neminus: No they saw it. But didn't that happen before the other night?
[0:13:37] magixss: didn't matter you won that game anyway, but it was one hella quick kill.. Wizk crack'D
[0:13:37] laha1n: its 100% possible that the observer POV was just delayed, and that half second could have made it look more sus than it actually was
[0:13:39] terranapart: @novaspectv Martian happened
[0:13:51] frofro00: what did you think of ww/sub and holy priest doing so well?
[0:13:52] ogkoop: I need that addon he has then
[0:13:53] Aramith9: you also won the game lol
[0:13:55] novaspectv: Martian?
[0:13:58] Eradivyn: WHERE IS YOUR HAIR, WHY DID YOU CUT IT
[0:14:01] lukex20duelist: lukex20duelist subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[0:14:09] terranapart: Wizk already explained it, he was expecting it and was ready for it.
[0:14:12] luckydyldo: what did Cass say about the hair situation
[0:14:20] jasonkbkt: The commentators were even reviewing it, in both of the games. Even at ultra slow motion we couldn't see the link
[0:14:34] nezz231: he was channeling so where the fuck would his mouse be if not where sam was.. crazy fast either way but not impossible
[0:14:34] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:14:37] Druid_Neminus: So what did ur wife say?
[0:14:41] belvedee: there is a clip if wiz explaining it
[0:14:43] R1_Prototype: I don’t think ww/sub/hpriest will stand up against the comps they are running in NA
[0:14:44] chr15x: @jasonkbkt is there a link of the slo mo
[0:14:44] mitchell_xd: it didnt matter cuz you guys won that game anyways
[0:14:48] Splendaz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF2X9Jgs-Eg&ab_channel=WorldofWarcraft
[0:14:51] Zenfuzz: link is visible and so is the pain that takes it out
[0:14:51] McLaughlin11: crazy that you guys won that game anyway! ggs today
[0:14:52] devilssin123: can you change the plater color for totems?
[0:14:52] Splendaz: vod review?
[0:14:55] davErosEe: he was channeling a void torrent and was looking for link while casting, not that big of a deal
[0:14:56] Timeless_jg: very solid games super fun to watch
[0:14:56] Havilahx: makes sense if its the nameplate
[0:14:58] DouzySham: https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyPolishedBorkPermaSmug-OOlmUlksReO-lrLX
[0:15:01] frikaboy: He was off gcd channeling void torrent expecting the link, hovering possible drop location @cdewx
[0:15:01] frofro00: quit bringing it up, its over..
[0:15:05] cvexgodx: Even before the AWC, this team was difficult for you. Unfortunately it wasn't enough in the AWC. So carry on, you can recognize the best players by their mind set.
[0:15:09] kreyzy8: LUL
[0:15:16] ogkoop: @frofro00 why? It's just a discussion
[0:15:18] terranapart: LUL chat instigating, stop chasing drama
[0:15:25] ATHLTE: you and the team played insane today dew
[0:15:33] SwarOG79: why is this that big a deal. Liquid won that game on ashmanes anyway
[0:15:35] SyrusXX: where is the click at and where can i watch it?
[0:15:37] kakichoco: yeah they played very well
[0:15:43] Jcres54: my thought was, theres one other guy that plays sham near the amount you do in AWC and TBH its not outrageous to have excellent timing as well as excellent intuition
[0:15:46] frofro00: he obviously doesn't want to entertain your comments about it
[0:15:47] ogkoop: I'm just saying whatever he did to kill that totem, I need that shit now
[0:15:50] bruhitzsam22: Literally nothing is gonna come from anyone thinking hes cheating rofl and he def wasnt
[0:15:52] soGGy69waFFle: Ive been hella busy with school, whats the lore on the hairstyle? lol
[0:15:58] DouzySham: No I don't think he cheated, no way. I just heard him talk about it on stream so clipped it
[0:15:59] ahoymate69: I really enjoyed watching Trill’s play style today, very calculated and precise
[0:16:00] Qdubbz: amazing series!
[0:16:05] shamebadge: I bet my house on Team Liquid like you said to do. I'm now homeless
[0:16:10] Qdubbz: think y'all played great

[0:16:13] Zenfuzz: Yeha it was a 100% predictable ring cause it was all the was left. homie knew it was coming, you can see it in video slow or not, and you can see the Pain take it out.
[0:16:22] McLaughlin11: do you think youll practice more cleaves for next cup?
[0:16:26] innovatingg: woke up the mrs cheering for ya in the final big man, bad luck for this series
[0:16:29] R1_Prototype: ww/sub is only scary for 5 seconds tho. you guys are running sustained pressure comps. I guess we’ll see
[0:16:31] frofro00: was good to see H priest today
[0:16:32] chr15x: bro i just watched the clip lol u cant even see the totem
[0:16:35] chr15x: sus af
[0:16:38] terranapart: a cloakarino
[0:16:39] JaeDee: Yo great games today homie
[0:16:43] ImPlutooo: really enjoy watching the shaman games on broadcast
[0:16:53] Cybernytez: oh noooo the cdru must be played? :/
[0:16:58] ExcessiveXO: What's with the braindead wizk haters in chat lol
[0:17:02] terranapart: It is what it is, sometimes you see them sometimes you don't KEKW
[0:17:04] chr15x: maybe the quality of the clips bad i cant see a totem
[0:17:07] Jcres54: i dont mean this disrespectfully, but the guy that LOST doesnt care, why does anyone else..
[0:17:09] ogkoop: @chr15x don't mention it you're going to offend @frofro00
[0:17:11] jujujujp: he also died eiwth disperse so
[0:17:11] jasonkbkt: Hook point was the same thing
[0:17:14] Druid_Neminus: It was Renewal that saved him I think
[0:17:14] PinxBDO: People trying to make something out of nothing
[0:17:28] kreyzy8: yeah the fact you can't see the nameplates makes it seem faster than it is
[0:17:29] terranapart: IT'S A NOTHING BURGER, STOP CHASING DRAMA
[0:17:40] coachingpotatoes: @PinxBDO, way too many ppl just addicted to drama
[0:17:40] Martem98: i saw some ppl saying he might have missclicked it while targeting sam
[0:17:42] frofro00: @ogkoop lets talk about it for another 30 mins then
[0:17:45] Swishinn: you busting out the cdru?
[0:17:52] DouzySham: @chr15x You can see the nameplate immediately from his POV
[0:17:54] Seventhedeadly: Dew, I know today was rough for you guys, but you did so damn amazing the entire weekend.. so freaking proud of you guys.
[0:17:54] Swishinn: to heal cleave?
[0:17:54] ndras: whole thing is blizzard fault for not addressing actual scripters like ever, now when someone makes insane play ofc ppl will doubt
[0:17:57] ndras: its not LAN
[0:18:00] shamebadge: the spectator UI is run on a Raspberry PI. they have terrible stream quality.  Whose rat PC was running the @Warcraft stream for AWC @cdewx ?
[0:18:00] Havilahx: its the nameplate and he was anticipating link and off global
[0:18:00] magixss: mes ele when?
[0:18:10] iggy_pls: ay chuck yall did amazing the games were insane you'll get them next time
[0:18:14] nezz231: ppl just have sad life and need to make drama for entertainment
[0:18:22] soulgluttony: the respect cdew for not taking the bait and discrediting. you played amazing today, both teams did I look forward to next cup
[0:18:25] shamebadge: was it one of the commentators?
[0:18:27] buttbutterson: do you need a haste vers cloak? Druid cloaks catalyze into those stats
[0:18:30] ogkoop: Ppl just need to not get emotional over a discussion. Discussing it doesn't mean he's being accused as guilty. It's whatever. Up to cdew at the end of the day, his stream
[0:18:30] Hyutra: ye
[0:18:32] mnowpsn: You guys did awesome today! Ur boomie rogue can beat anything imo, also that ww sub on EU was fun 2 watch
[0:18:32] soulgluttony: huge respect *
[0:18:48] Martem98: what you think of hoolibang?
[0:18:48] Onca4242: They did spend way way way too long on it lol.
[0:18:51] Elesfam: ILVL is diff
[0:18:57] Eradivyn: explain the hair
[0:19:06] iggy_pls: that hpriest was insane
[0:19:08] qabraa: WTF its just happen to ur face xDDD @cdewx  ????
[0:19:10] cresentz27: unforch for the 2nd place for the bois, insane dmg from trill tho
[0:19:11] mnowpsn: He got donated 10k
[0:19:13] kreyzy8: hpriest mana seems pretty good
[0:19:16] Martem98: think they can keep it up or ppl will just counter them
[0:19:16] mytownnn: you feel good how u guys played?! #
[0:19:18] aftershockzzzz: off hand ilvl is lower than staff and main hand
[0:19:19] mnowpsn: To shave half half for whose asking
[0:19:20] Complezity: you think you are gonna bring rdruid to the next cup ?
[0:19:21] Qdubbz: hoping the team is all in good spirit
[0:19:32] ndras: i mean echo was on top for sooooo long
[0:19:36] mytownnn: that’s good man

[0:19:43] Martem98: all your games vs TM were close af tbh
[0:19:44] kreyzy8: both series were super close
[0:19:45] Swishinn: its weird that you go 1-1 against them but you get 2nd
[0:19:53] Semis394: what changed ?

[0:21:01] c10starburst: trill is a dps god

[0:34:04] blightclub: @meactv auction house
[0:34:09] meactv: thanks!
[0:34:09] AlternateProject: @meactv Ask Sam, he is the waterboy

[0:40:48] Disemble: Putting mes in last round was basically conceding. This is coming from someone that wants to see you guys win lol

[2:28:20] Shablagoosh: you probs already talked about it but what did you think of ww rogue on eu awc
[2:28:28] shleffguy: shleffguy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! your my boy dewwww hope everything is going good and you kick ass in the awcs!

[2:31:24] Shablagoosh: maybe he ran like 50% haste and no vers lol
[2:31:31] kaounallah: why does trill do so much more dam than pikaboo?
[2:31:32] Maaybees: he stepped up i guess lol
[2:31:33] TrippyvV: He is THE shadow priest like if someone knows a way to tune up dmg and keep it for a more critical series its him
[2:31:44] ChumpSeason: outlaw/rsham ain't exactly easy to get clones on either lol
[2:31:57] soothingmistmonk: do you think it’s cause he went orc? so stuns didn’t stop him as much?

[2:34:30] Druid_Neminus: I don't think the totem has a huge health pool either
[2:34:37] chinchan333: he was deathing the totems no swp
[2:34:53] TrippyvV: But it has to be spirit link being slow af in that one game. People freaked out because the totem didnt even get a tick off
[2:35:13] Blvd88: he swp it he said it after games
[2:35:24] Shablagoosh: eh mag isnt saying anything worse than sam does lol
[2:35:25] leon8221: the question is how did he targeet it so fast?
[2:35:28] Blvd88: cancel void torrent on swp global
[2:35:29] baljovan2147: it had to do with his 4 set. he didn’t kill it, it auto killed it. totem only has like 20k hp
[2:35:42] palawakeup: his 4 set doesnt auto kill
[2:36:02] Shad_WW: @leon8221 just mouseover pain, and held global
[2:36:05] TrippyvV: How does the 4set kill a totem before it even lands lol
[2:36:10] palawakeup: it doesnt
[2:36:12] palawakeup: that guy in chat is wrong
[2:36:18] palawakeup: it gives him procs but he needs to press them
[2:36:20] palawakeup: nothing is auto
[2:36:23] Shablagoosh: ive seen pika kill links in shuffles before you even see the ring appear
[2:36:52] palawakeup: cant you macro it as well?
[2:36:55] TrippyvV: The tick still goes off
[2:36:59] palawakeup: like to instant target the totem
[2:37:11] kreyzy8: there is no macro, you just have to click the nameplate fast lol
[2:37:15] sayolxx: Wizk can just see and click faster than the speed of light that's all.
[2:37:21] TrippyvV: Never seen a link be killed before it gets a tick off. Then it has to be a positioning thing
[2:37:35] stapradio: did cdew shave half his face lol
[2:37:49] Shad_WW: @TrippyvV its just mouseover pain on the nameplate
[2:37:57] TrippyvV: Thats what chat and casters are so fussed out about. Not him "just killing it fast"
[2:37:58] palawakeup: or death
