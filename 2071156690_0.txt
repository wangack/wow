She’s meant to be very outgoing and full of energy, someone that is very active. We partnered those kinds of traits with her looks, and we didn’t think it would be embarrassing for her to be on screen while, for example, your parents are in the same room.”

[0:49:58] mL_Kuja: @Anganthyr 10
[0:50:00] Txn_Nerothos: @chavelo_ yeah, turn based would 100% sell and if they made a remake of 8 or 9 peoples would want the OG combat style even if changed a bit
[0:50:02] chavelo_: @Anganthyr yes
[0:50:03] Kayvonnn: not as useful as blasting my ears
[0:50:03] Angryjester671: it does

[0:50:21] Yr_Helwyr: @Txn_Nerothos 9's combat has aged incredibly badly
[0:50:22] Kojiharuwu: saw LUL
[0:50:31] chavelo_: @jokkebo1 because it wasnt an established franchise. If FF made a Turn based game it would sell just as well
[0:50:44] 1Lyrith: @tailech hmm. doing a play-along. anyway I hit mid 80s, and I am noticing that our damage numbers are pretty much the same
[0:50:46] Txn_Nerothos: @Yr_Helwyr it just need to be a bit change and sped up
[0:50:48] Terra___l: @chavelo_ fun facz octo 1/2 got sold  more then ff 15/16 togehter
[0:50:53] jokkebo1: @chavelo_ maybe but i 100% doubt that
[0:51:05] DMG9: that would require you to do the MSQ
[0:51:06] Ayarai: @chavelo_ Octopath 2 sold pretty poorly though compared to how many platforms it is available
[0:51:06] Yr_Helwyr: @Txn_Nerothos If you want to play 8 or 9 again, just play 8 or 9 again. 1 for 1 remakes are boring af
[0:51:07] twentytweenty: Listening
[0:51:11] mimekh: 10 was last true turn-based, 13 was last active time battle (enemies attack while you're deciding)

[0:51:18] Anganthyr: @Yr_Helwyr so the last turn based ff is from over a decade ago... I doubt turn based will come back to mainline FF then
[0:51:22] Teorino1984: @Yr_Helwyr the steal chance is the only thing i didn't like about FF9 combat - but I hated it with a passion so it tainted the whole thing
[0:51:25] fripple4: if you're putting magic on the party, you might want to make them with more than 3 charges

[0:51:57] onetwojango: @chavelo_ i prefer TB combat but I agree with active they reach more audience. still its not bad. but 16 lacked a lot of rpg elemets that we used to in ff

[0:52:02] viczz88: Beauties? BOOBA
[0:52:10] Txn_Nerothos: @Mordy_the_Mighty enough but most wanted less multivers bullshit tho

[0:52:41] Yr_Helwyr: @onetwojango 16 needs a lot of expanding and improving btu could absolutely be adjusted to be more FF and fit 8 perfectly. 9 would be a bad fit for ff16 style
[0:52:45] rymed: 16 feels like the skeleton of good combat, but it needed way more fleshing out

[0:53:18] CapriDumb: The FF fandom is the funniest, cuase no one can agree on anything KEKW
[0:53:23] yuiona: @Yurian33 then play games with that combat. its pretty clear that ff will not be like that again

[0:53:54] m_azark: it was the systems and Story
[0:53:58] onetwojango: @Yr_Helwyr clearly it was dev desision to skip prj and try to go story+combat. every ff is different I just hope they see that funs want rpg more than very good combat
[0:54:03] Riyshn: @chavelo_ They'd also have to balance for both. At that point just make 2 entirely seperate games
[0:54:09] Yurian33: @yuiona I do play them. I havent played any game with combat like this. I watch Mike play them.
[0:54:26] m_azark: so I personally don't care about the combat, I just care about the story and systems in the game (like job systems)
[0:54:27] Junglecack: Did the combat change in royal edition? I remember it being just put attack and warp strike and being a breeze
[0:54:31] smartm07: yeah, if there is a bush, you should be able to penetrate it
[0:54:34] viczz88: conditions for spawn? Shruge
[0:54:35] chavelo_: @Riyshn fine as well. Ive said in previous talks here that they should split the franchise in 2. 1 ARPG line and 1 Turn based line
[0:54:35] eranthras: I think you have to kill the other mobs ye
[0:54:37] Mordy_the_Mighty: @chavelo_ that's kind of making two games at the same time though XD unless you just want the fake real time/fake turn based combat of the SNES+ era
[0:54:37] Kayvonnn: oh no
[0:54:38] Yr_Helwyr: @onetwojango I think that's a solid take. I like the action combat but want more variety to it.

[2:42:24] 1Lyrith: DLC IS A MUST if you dont want the game to be over tomorrow - it is MID STORY CONTENT.
[2:42:25] Azphelle: please at least play the Ardyn DLC after the game!
[2:42:26] savnokuwu: like finding a needle in a haystack
[2:42:33] WavePath: 2-3 hours ISH each
[2:42:34] blacckmore: blacckmore subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 19 month streak! imagine this sudden break in the story with no dlc in the vanila game. Nothing jarring.
[2:42:34] DaftiDuck_: all the dlcs are really good
[2:42:34] MittensSlowpaw: @1lyrith Maybe I should make more potato soup then for chill watching!
[2:42:35] DJDigiUK: there is only 1 really good one NODDERS
[2:42:35] ployboi69: :)
[2:42:36] chillpasta: 2 hour each
[2:42:41] jaylitz_: they're good for post-game anyway, messes up the flow doing it during the game imo
[2:42:42] suzaku70: Wasnt Gladios like 30 min?
[2:42:44] Alyassus: yeah

[2:42:50] bugz_munny: TAKE THE SHOT Smadge
[2:42:55] Wojo77: yep
[2:42:55] jaredfource: Its funny because I think if the game realized its full potential, all bro Episodes would have been in the base game as well as being able to play them
[2:42:59] MeridianPuppeteer: They kinda do tbh...
[2:43:00] WavePath: @Preachlfw so you know the game is not finished ; a part of the game is on the DLC at least that was what the community was saying when they came out with DLC after game
[2:43:00] Tyki_jp: The DLC is roughly 1 hour if you just rush for the story, 2 hours if you wanna 100% it
[2:43:02] 1Lyrith: Gladio DLC is happening right now IN CANON
[2:43:02] Yr_Helwyr: They kind of do
[2:43:05] melodyy421: they kinda do since its so jarring
[2:43:06] maxyboy400: you kinda do
[2:43:07] Selverya: @Preachlfw but the dlc were planned from the beginning
[2:43:07] Txn_Nerothos: catJAMPARTY
[2:43:08] ravenofjudgement: Bedge
[2:43:09] Lctl10: NO DLC = Experiencing the pain we all did
[2:43:09] urbish_: Listening
[2:43:10] Nodapse234: Bedge
[2:43:10] Chewmii: Bedge
[2:43:10] Klassicoops: Listening
[2:43:11] ployboi69: @suzaku70 You expecting the Strummer to take only 30 min? Kappa
[2:43:11] DJDigiUK: Listening
[2:43:12] PlexasAideron: the game was just incomplete. the dlc should've been part of the game
[2:43:13] Alyassus: wideVIBE
[2:43:14] PorkSoda__: Listening
[2:43:15] SZebra: PianoTime
[2:43:17] spellsword91: got any FF6 CD's?
[2:43:17] tecnicallynot: Bedge
[2:43:18] TheAmazingNick: this car looks sick in yellow
[2:43:18] xo_navi: Listening
[2:43:20] garyhun: HahaSleep
[2:43:20] redroniksre: They were to fill in the gaps since they never explain it in the MSQ
[2:43:23] DMG9: 15 on launch was incomplete. one of the major reasons why people disliked the game on launch. this was fixed later with the DLCs.
[2:43:23] Walssimaakari: Chat hammering it with the DLC talk KEKW
[2:43:24] Medias: wideNessie
[2:43:25] Riyshn: The DLCs are the intended [acing. The base game was a incomplete mess that the DLCs pretty much exist to patch up
[2:43:25] jaylitz_: I miss Robin Williams Cid
[2:43:26] Sprakenheit: wideVIBE
[2:43:26] suzaku70: @ployboi69 True
[2:43:28] Methuzahla: Alloooooo one video rendered
[2:43:31] amalgamrhowa: the game was incomplete on release and still is to an extent
[2:43:32] MeridianPuppeteer: The DLC were meant to be part of the MSQ.
[2:43:33] Methuzahla: arent you missing a dude
[2:43:34] m_azark: @jaredfource nah the bro episodes would've been properly integrated into the game as a chapter if they had more time
[2:43:37] Methuzahla: why there only 3
[2:43:38] spellsword91: Sadge
[2:43:41] BadGamer_og: Has he learned to use aoe techniques on large mobs or is he still single target champ LUL
[2:43:43] troupet: Clueless
[2:43:44] nufulini: gladio and prompto dlc can be played during the game but ignis and the final one spoil stuff
[2:43:46] JamesandHat: Yeah the dlc are kinda non optional in this one i found
[2:43:48] Txn_Nerothos: @Methuzahla he left
[2:43:48] Asacai: extend chocobo while at it
[2:43:50] DJDigiUK: COPIUM
[2:43:51] WavePath: @Preachlfw the FF Fans got huge hate on Square for thi sgame ; because the DLC shouldve been part of the game ; cause the game is incomplete and DLC finish the game
[2:43:51] ropergaran: are hot dogs in this game?
[2:43:54] TAYPH00N: its the benchmark road Pog
[2:43:58] PaeToWin: @Methuzahla other guy went for milk
[2:44:04] melodyy421: @Riyshn hated playing base game without dlc causs of this
[2:44:06] WavePath: @Preachlfw usually DLC are extra content not a part of the game completion % KEKW
[2:44:10] Rajaion1992: @Methuzahla changed guild and took the loot
[2:44:12] Methuzahla: D: You made (insert name here) leave?! @Preachlfw
[2:44:17] DonAsel: @Methuzahla gladio had to get out of that... car
[2:44:26] persi_enne: @WavePath I honestly think it's the last part of the game that was just unfished that was the bigger issue XD
[2:44:28] bugz_munny: Id love if they actually incorporated the DLC but it is what it is
[2:44:32] PlexasAideron: @WavePath game will never be complete unfortunately Sadge
[2:44:33] PacoXI: vanilla 15 is literally like the writers suddenly got adhd at some point and just ended the story
[2:44:37] amalgamrhowa: the problem is this game needs you to consume a movie, an anime series and play all the dlc to make any sense. the base game is unplayable on its own
[2:44:40] TheAmazingNick: Classic Florida Sahagin
[2:44:41] JakeZGR: @Methuzahla Yes, he quit because Mike was so boring
[2:44:42] chavelo_: its low level....
[2:44:48] Methuzahla: Mike made (insert name here) leave PepeHands
