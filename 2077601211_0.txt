[0:53:56] erasertko: im a bodybuilder its steroids not creatine its all marketing
[0:54:04] ginyu_music: tune
[0:54:08] docholiday233: all creatine really does is force water into the muscle
[0:54:11] erasertko: nothing builds muscle only food and steroids
[0:54:15] HouseOnFire: It just gives you huge amounts of energy plus retains water

[0:54:55] sitosterolpvp: Its theraputic
[0:55:00] hellotwice: do u think cdew is on steroids
[0:55:06] xzinpvp: Eat a iced honey bun with peanut butter on it befoe bed, you'll bulk + creatine(absorbed water really good so u look biger) keep your movement high so u burn the 3500+ cal from the honey buns but while u sleep you'll bulk
[0:55:13] ryguyforty5: that was that guys duelist game…rip
[0:55:17] downypoof: downypoof subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! the move baby
[0:55:18] sitosterolpvp: HCG just makes sure my balls dont die while i take test
[0:55:34] xchilam: can you earn more than one vicious saddle each season after the mount?
[0:55:38] erasertko: ive been lifting for 8 years consistent now natty gains are like playing in vanilla wow so hard and taxing
[0:55:38] newageexotics: love how my healer doesn't press ps :)
[0:55:38] Skeetcannon79: my test is higher at age 35 than it was at 25, and much higher than the average 18 year old, and its mainly due to a specific diet and fixing sleep
[0:55:43] sitosterolpvp: if you dont take it they shrink and stop producing
[0:56:07] theGNL: the gains bro
[0:56:08] pzeper: ground beef shake
[0:56:13] averagenjoyerrrr: my mate was eating like 5000cals of macdonalds a day on top of other food
[0:56:15] averagenjoyerrrr: crazy
[0:56:18] sitosterolpvp: sleep is a very high contributor @Skeetcannon79
[0:56:38] xps9000: Yeah, at my peak I could eat 4000 calories a day and maintain. Now, my maintenance calories is like 2600.
[0:56:45] vostrot: creatine and eating a gram of protein per body weight = game changer
[0:56:47] averagenjoyerrrr: @Skeetcannon79 yea i really need to get ontop of my sleep
[0:56:52] cyborg1141: Creatine beefshakes for life
[0:56:58] erasertko: take 1 cycle and u will look as cool as a R1
[0:56:59] Vdarkblade: @Pikabooirl , how do we go about getting me a 4 year badge for being part of the greatest gaming community in the world, pikabooMove ?
[0:57:07] erasertko: 1 cycle never hurts
[0:57:08] R1_Prototype: I gained 40 lbs in a little over a year. up to 190. but I had to literally eat 8-10k calories a day to put on ANYTHING.
[0:57:28] Ztormurr: did you look at the trickster hero talent tree ?
[0:57:31] nurotv: is test safe/easy to get from dr?
[0:57:33] sitosterolpvp: oh ya.. blast and cruise man.. you just need PCT and its fine
[0:57:40] erasertko: u can keep 60% of the gains if u have done ur pct correctly
[0:57:43] sitosterolpvp: "Post cycle therapy"
[0:57:51] brandonnnnnnnnnn: I run everyday and my resting heart rate is 52 but I look like I've never hit the gym in my life. Peoples bodies deal with this shit differently.
[0:57:57] sitosterolpvp: its true...
[0:58:04] erasertko: now 60% from a cycle is way better than 10 years of natty gains
[0:58:10] averagenjoyerrrr: @nurotv maybe in the USA but outside USA not so easy, theyll test you to check your levels
[0:58:22] Skeetcannon79: @sitosterolpvp yessir, done lab tests after experimenting with sleep using months of data from whoop/apple watch sleep scans, that sleep improvment with an incredibly high fat diet increased my test by over 80% in 6 months
[0:58:23] yaboydave91: i /reloaded mid game by accident lmfao
[0:58:26] averagenjoyerrrr: @erasertko unfortunately true KEKW
[0:58:28] sitosterolpvp: its not cheating if you arent doing it for sports. if its just so you look better/feel better whats the problem is what i think
[0:58:29] erasertko: I swear
[0:58:39] Lunakaze: TRT the way to go
[0:58:46] erasertko: I took tren for 2 months 250 lbs 6% ripped to the bones
[0:58:46] Divine303: hello
[0:58:49] dirtbagjimmy1021: it takes time..... just thats the way it is
[0:58:49] averagenjoyerrrr: natty literally takes years of dedication
[0:58:53] erasertko: looked like hulk literally
[0:58:55] Skeetcannon79: @averagenjoyerrrr yeah man, after months of tracking my sleep on apple watch and doing lab work test went up 80%
[0:59:05] maren7810: Lock is out of this world
[0:59:05] sitosterolpvp: TRT changed a lot about how i think how i feel its great. with that being said doing it at 20 is probbaly not great
[0:59:09] erasertko: was going to do a show but my liver started acting weird
[0:59:12] ShutrMcGavin: it’s also super expensive
[0:59:14] leslarocque: @skeetcannon79 I gotta get me an apple watxh
[0:59:16] R1_Prototype: it’s almost like watching r1 players on twitch all day. Am I doing this right? are they using a better mouse than me?
[0:59:19] leslarocque: @skeetcannon79 watch*
[0:59:24] Divine303: i feel like donating nut does he read donations ?
[0:59:25] kevogasm: 1oz of broccoli has more protein than 1 oz of chicken
[0:59:26] Ryso33: like a dang red hot
[0:59:33] bloopsftw: @Skeetcannon79 You eating keto/carnivore? I been eating keto 7 years
[0:59:33] Skeetcannon79: im pro natural body builder, im 35 now, been lifting 15 years, PEOPLE ARE JUST NOW starting to think i take GEAR, but only when my shirt is off.
[0:59:35] leslarocque: @divine303 yeah
[0:59:37] erasertko: steroids thins the skins
[0:59:40] sitosterolpvp: a lot about the skin is genetic. you can be in great shape and look soft.. just how it works
[0:59:44] erasertko: its the cosmetic part of it
[0:59:45] averagenjoyerrrr: @Skeetcannon79 wow thats wild im just at the start of kicking off a 6 months training program might need to add seep stuff in there
[1:00:12] ajdowers: Protein shakes are a good source bro.  You just can’t replace meals with them.  You need to drink the shakes in between meals  - coming from a D1 athlete
[1:00:21] sitosterolpvp: its very big but, thats the dif between the top 1% and the rest of the world. THATS genetics..
[1:00:21] erasertko: u would look great in men's physique as asian heritage
[1:00:22] raxxom: ppl train abs?
[1:00:24] chancywilson: honestly time is key, some ppl being playing sports training year around since ge 5
[1:00:25] Dejon09: was he jacked
[1:00:29] Dejon09: I’m sure he was
[1:00:39] erasertko: small waist withbsome tren= boom
[1:00:47] brandonnnnnnnnnn: I had a friend who could eat absolutely anything and still had an eight pack constantly while I was always in the gym and meal prepping.
[1:00:51] Skeetcannon79: @bloopsftw mostly keto/carnivore but def still eatin fruits, but ONLY organic fruits, all the pesticides on the fruit can lower test and other shit. LOTS of whole milk (1 gallon a day minimum) and a lot of cheese
[1:00:57] R1_Prototype: seabum is something else. lmao
[1:01:05] ShawniXD: LOL
[1:01:06] fieryferal: GIGACHAD

[1:01:31] erasertko: gigachad since high school
[1:01:31] Staygoldenx: both
[1:01:32] raxxom: genetics for sure
[1:01:32] sitosterolpvp: tren is great but Primo is where its at if you actually have a long term outlook. Tren is like I need gains NOW.. they go away too for the most part but... I dont know tren is fine depends on if you are a receptive subject too
[1:01:32] Skeetcannon79: Cbum looked best in 2017 before he started getting to big

[1:02:02] raxxom: 14-18
[1:02:07] boppinz: Have you ever seen Brock Lesnar in highschool? Or his daughter?
[1:02:11] Skeetcannon79: he actually looked good bald when he shaved it for the transplant lol
[1:02:15] thisisthotcaller: extra test just absolutely ruins hairlines for the most part
[1:02:16] Voriq: I'm fucking edging rn bro thanks
[1:02:20] erasertko: all males eventually go bald
[1:02:24] erasertko: cuz of our hormones
[1:02:30] R1_Prototype: no matter who you are, if you look at yourself enough, you’ll find something you don’t like.

[1:04:02] Skeetcannon79: highly advise against roids, but if you do, stick to anavar and primo. thats the "half natty" "safest" stack. and if you do low dose you shouldnt need a test base

[2:45:29] mexirican81: LOL your warrior pulled a Leroy Jenkins
[2:45:48] mxddisonb_: @doolz51 there are nice people in pvp. it’s pretty easy to gear. use the premade groups to find someone to run 2’s with but put in the title/description that you’re new to it
[2:45:48] Fourofdiamonds1: imma go put in a pizza for this
[2:45:49] forggeesportsnutrition: Yeah Locks so tanky
[2:45:56] moistydank: i believe
[2:46:03] CalyOG: balanced
[2:46:07] denliveshere: if you wait for damp long enough easy
[2:46:10] Doolz51: I feel like rogue is bad to learn on. any reccs for starter class for getting into pvp?
[2:46:18] gotchakidney: go sham no trinket now?
[2:46:22] Johnykarate: dh is really easy
[2:46:31] icratosx: ....
[2:46:32] firbiirn: @Pikabooirl pls react to the wow cinbematics

[2:46:41] mxddisonb_: @doolz51 demon hunter
[2:46:41] icratosx: that seemed a little stream snipey
[2:46:50] Johnykarate: @Doolz51 i started about a week and half ago and im 1800 never played pvp before and new to wow in general
[2:47:01] iranholy: Wow LUL LUL gg warrior
[2:47:03] Johnykarate: with dh
[2:47:15] Doolz51: @Johnykarate solo shuff? what class?
[2:47:33] denliveshere: it is possible 100% damp i took people there as sub
[2:47:37] Doolz51: nvm i just saw
[2:47:43] uhbaku: winnable tbh
[2:47:50] stonedboodah: sham has no wall
[2:47:51] Johnykarate: yeah solo i am and like 1700 in duos
[2:47:56] NareeM: i dont like that all classes are so hardto kill
[2:47:58] trump_tvx: you gonna play cata at all?
[2:48:07] CalyOG: @Doolz51 DH is just strong and actually not easy to learn the game. something like ret or warr as melee prob better for learning
[2:48:34] sanguine_ink: Never doubt ^
[2:48:37] Johnykarate: @CalyOG i feel like dh has a good amount of cc and its good for learning when to use it to burst people down
[2:48:50] uhbaku: uh oh
[2:48:50] steebet: why is he playing kick pet hmm
[2:48:57] brevillance_: @calyog DH is literally perfect to learn on; theres so few buttons and its an easy rotation. Its literally the most forgiving to learn on
[2:49:01] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: Do you ever play assassination?
[2:49:08] BTLemur: BTLemur subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Cash money
[2:49:11] anniefan1337: yoooo
[2:49:22] HavoucGaming: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf Assass is Ass so no lool
[2:49:44] CalyOG: @brevillance_ Not having to press buttons isnt going to learn you when to do stuff, also never being the target doesent learn you when to use defensives. not being able to be held down doesent learn you how to use mobility etc.
[2:49:51] SMOrc_Face_SMOrc: i didnt even know you could sap the lock dog
[2:49:54] iranholy: Kids. Like warrior is every where NotLikeThis NotLikeThi
[2:50:00] thales_proudmoore: gg, they took you seriously lol
[2:50:04] denliveshere: this is the hardest map for damp stall tho, no place to pillar around etc. thats why i hate this map
[2:50:12] forggeesportsnutrition: A for effort!

[2:50:31] steebet: after keeping them hostage for that long didn't even give them the killing blow LUL
[2:50:36] Johnykarate: @CalyOG u can die as DH espically once u get to a decent rank which doesnt take long if if its easy if ur not good u still wont make it past 1600 if u dont know the basics
[2:50:42] TimmyShoes: it's double dps

[2:51:04] denliveshere: lets go
[2:51:06] brevillance_: @calyog it gives you time to learn around their abilities; and gives you all the tools to survive, it also means you get to learn when to burst around their defensives. It also means you dont need to juggle a lot of CDs or buttons which also gives more time to watch and look around and see whats going on. Its perfect to learn on; its zug zug and means you can learn all the basics
