[0:14:42] BBMezzy: That'd be a shame
[0:14:42] Pandachoww: hated this week for keys
[0:15:07] Pandachoww: fortified, bolstering, its been a pain
[0:15:16] Layliah79: @Pandachoww Yeah same! really don't need anything from keys on my main. But those Mythic Tindral nerfs will be nice tonight. We were already at 28%.

[0:17:39] Samiccus: the worst
[0:17:43] leakies_lil_rat: @mrgm I fucking love you right now.

[0:17:51] MonarchTeaV: wow thatâ€™s was worse than me
[0:17:59] leakies_lil_rat: Salt to the wound .. Mmm
[0:18:02] Samiccus: If only BLP worked in real life
[0:18:03] Pandachoww: im convinced BLP just isnt a thing
[0:18:08] Layliah79: next week would be 100% if you've been killing it since week 1
[0:18:22] leakies_lil_rat: Even at 100% drop rate sam still not getting it... ;)
[0:18:23] Samiccus: lmao np! I did lol thanks for tuning in <3
[0:18:23] FinkTV: i have the legendary but it is a pain in the ass as a blook dk
[0:18:41] Mordotzz: T & E showed the drop rate
[0:18:54] Layliah79: ohh so we're not relevant since we don't play hunters mrgmKEKW
[0:18:54] demololtv: SUP DAN
[0:19:01] Samiccus: it was datamined that basically 15 kills on heroic will get you to 100% drop
[0:19:06] Pandachoww: pally on na, dk on eu, rip me
[0:19:17] Mordotzz: Kinda fair imho cus it's high ilvl right
[0:19:21] nash25pl: I play paladin and its a paladin healer. so i told my guild when it drops for me and not for either of our counless paladins, warriors, dks  I be laughing cause i would never use it KEKW
[0:19:47] NotDanWood: Transmog is the real endgame
[0:19:48] Layliah79: could Ret in keys @nash25pl :D'
[0:19:49] nash25pl: i dont have 2h guy to use as mog
[0:20:02] leakies_lil_rat: 2nd into ?
[0:20:03] nash25pl: @Layliah79 I played healer since TBC i dont think i ever do anything else
[0:20:17] Samiccus: pre-alpha was great lol
[0:20:31] demololtv: did they annouance when alpha is?
[0:20:36] nash25pl: pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre ALPHA !
[0:20:38] Mordotzz: I think night fÃ¥et assault in maw if u still need mount there
[0:20:47] Mordotzz: Fae*
[0:21:13] Rhiinehart: SL monkaS
[0:21:15] nash25pl: @MrGM if you want tips how to get the most anima let me know I been stuck in SL for a LONG TIME !
[0:21:19] Mordotzz: Can just do the weeklies
[0:21:20] Layliah79: they need to open covenant cosmetics account wide!
[0:21:36] leakies_lil_rat: Did u hear @mrgm apparently @samiccus stole content from another streamer... he stole his entire look and beard...  Sam is the new Mr. STEAL your content... so just watch out.
[0:21:45] nash25pl: @Mordotzz yes and not for anima  ZM and Korthia is best anima farming spots atm
[0:21:46] Layliah79: SL was fun for casual content.
[0:21:57] Layliah79: so many mounts
[0:21:59] Mordotzz: I downloaded a todo list addon to keep track of my stuff
[0:22:14] Mordotzz: I'm focusing on the pvp wq atm
[0:22:15] Layliah79: covenant activities were a lot of fun!
[0:22:29] nash25pl: its funny but people dont know that some SL mounts are locked behind prequests that are never mentioned at the start
[0:22:38] Layliah79: just wish player power wasn't locked behind them. only thing i think that ruined them for players
[0:22:51] Mordotzz: Ember court is daily now so it's nice
[0:22:52] MediumRareOG: Even with free renown 60? I have 10+ toons with Renown 80 in all 4 covenants and didn't really have to try to get that
[0:22:54] Samiccus: @leakies_lil_rat lol that guy is an idiot
[0:23:00] Rhiinehart: did you do korthia?
[0:23:06] nash25pl: Gorger mount from Revendreth its had higher drop chance if you finish a specific side quest
[0:23:06] Layliah79: After I did Ember Court x4 then they unlocked it daily KEKW
[0:23:26] Mordotzz: Lmao
[0:23:30] nash25pl: famu drop rate is higher if you unlock all anima conductors for revendrath too
[0:23:34] Layliah79: domination shards
[0:23:36] MediumRareOG: I got all the Korthia mounts and never went back
[0:23:41] Layliah79: ohh that!
[0:23:56] Layliah79: still missing the mount from the chests in ZMortis
[0:24:01] Layliah79: opened near 500 of them
[0:24:03] Mordotzz: Yeah 1 for each cov
[0:24:07] nash25pl: yes they do Korthia has 3 per covanat
[0:24:22] Bware2: u can only summon the rare if you are a certain covenant, the mount can drop for everyone though
[0:24:22] Mordotzz: I miss mog from there
[0:24:27] Layliah79: Did you get the fishing jellyfish mount? @MrGM
[0:24:29] leakies_lil_rat: @samiccus he may be an idiot... but at least the man is original.. Bahahah stealing a faded beard... not kewl sam... ( such a meme )
[0:24:48] Layliah79: omg i don't remember. it was in ZM
[0:24:53] MediumRareOG: i still need to farm genesis motes and grateful offerings, sigh
[0:25:00] sakura_2020: deepstar aurelid
[0:25:21] Layliah79: exactly!
[0:25:28] MediumRareOG: My advice? Buy the STrange Goop on the AH to get that mount
[0:25:34] grepew: I got motivated to start my own complition grind after seeing your posts on Twitter, I did start from SL and pvp side of things. Few weeks ago I ago I bought all the weapon arsenals, took about 2800 marks of honor.
[0:25:35] Mordotzz: I reached 700. Still long to go
[0:25:52] nash25pl: worst part about ZM is the crafting moutns soo much farming when it was current content now its bit easier cause things die much faster
[0:25:55] sakura_2020: you can get the strange goop on the ah
[0:26:04] Mordotzz: Holy how do u have that many
[0:26:41] MediumRareOG: I think I need 3000 marks for all the arsenals. Best case? it'll take me a year
[0:26:45] nash25pl: BRB work meeting :yawn:
[0:27:12] Sawfreak666: is some information up foir more race class combos in the future
[0:27:16] grepew: I am only honor level 173, the boxes that give 5 marks for 2k honor made the grind easier.
[0:27:18] mattpfr: Hello :) coucou tout le monde !
[0:27:18] Rhiinehart: have you finished tmog for this tier?
[0:27:31] grepew: Now I am working on the sets, the only vendor I got fully done is the bfa pvp one
[0:27:54] NotDanWood: GOBLIN DRUID!!!!
[0:27:59] NotDanWood: PLEASE!
[0:28:01] Rhiinehart: need my nelf pally
[0:28:03] the_chadillac: All I did for the last 3 years of playing WoW was working towards completionism before quitting so your streams are therapeutic for me.
[0:28:05] MediumRareOG: Vulpera druid and paladin
[0:28:12] Sawfreak666: thats will be amazing pre level for new expansion
[0:28:17] Bware2: undead pallys
[0:28:20] leakies_lil_rat: Fox boi druid.... Inc
[0:28:20] lyreilla: Happy Tuesday
[0:28:21] Pandachoww: nelf pala.....i would 100000% race change
[0:28:28] Sawfreak666: werewolf pala ui
[0:28:54] Lausten: I was kind of hoping for more druid races now that we are in the dream, maybe 10.2.7
[0:29:15] MuuskeWoW: Good afternoon. hows the collecting going?
[0:29:33] NotDanWood: NotDanWood subscribed with Prime. 
[0:29:35] MediumRareOG: Asmon often has good takes on things, including this
[0:29:49] Mystic_Bard: yeh, especialy when everything said gets climp chimped :S
[0:29:51] Sawfreak666: i really hope the bring some uptades before new expansion because thats will be smart
[0:29:51] MuuskeWoW: MuuskeWoW subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:29:58] Mordotzz: He uploade a 2 hour vid. Can someone give me a tldr
[0:31:07] Pandachoww: think im one of the few people who has never actually watched asmon...
[0:31:36] Pandachoww: i think i tried to years ago but he just really annoys me idk
[0:31:43] ren0m: I love your content; thank you for keeping me up-to-date with all the changes in WoW.
[0:32:06] Mystic_Bard: yeh, and depends what type of stream is each
[0:32:06] RAF_Sean: Oh snap! Early Dan!
[0:32:17] Bware2: but thats true about more or less everything though.... being good at something I mean.
[0:32:28] leakies_lil_rat: Ehh for me @mrgm the streamer themselves are the content.. if they can have a good time and joke around that's what makes it great.
[0:32:31] Rhiinehart: you got any videos coming out soon?
[0:32:52] Sawfreak666: Nightelf pala with dark eyes sounds so sexy haha
[0:33:06] ren0m: What do you stream? Achievement farming, M+, raids, PvP?
[0:33:38] RAF_Sean: Dude I am so excited for Delves
[0:33:39] Rhiinehart: nice nice
[0:33:44] RAF_Sean: I hope they don't underwhelm
[0:34:02] leakies_lil_rat: "Swap blasting people in LFR" I would watch that ;)
[0:34:07] Jelky55: mrgmHelloThere mrgmHelloThere
[0:34:16] Lausten: Title to make the angry mob go away.: "What you already know about delves if you're a regular wow player, dont be mad if its not new to you" Kappa
[0:34:40] Jelky55: solo running WM m+? :P
[0:34:52] Bware2: if you dont do this dungeon on mplus maybe people runt to the last boss?
[0:34:57] Jelky55: yep
[0:35:09] Jelky55: back in Legion a DH tank soloed court of stars 20
[0:35:25] RAF_Sean: I will watch a streamer who isn't actively engaged in the chat if they're playing the game at an extremely high level (mostly just tank povs) but otherwise I enjoy the talking. Makes me feel like someone is in the room with me while I work
[0:35:35] grepew: I have seen this on blood dk do a 20+ atal but it took 6 hours
[0:35:53] MediumRareOG: In SL, I saw videos about blood DKs soloing M+
[0:36:14] RAF_Sean: Started talking to Shadow in those breaks lol
[0:36:35] Jelky55: https://www.wowhead.com/news/mionee-solos-court-of-stars-22-282350
[0:36:36] lyreilla: What level key is this? Sorry if you answered this. I'm multitasking
[0:36:57] RAF_Sean: You are exceptionally good at creating an engaging chat 10/10
[0:37:02] leakies_lil_rat: @raf_sean i watch someone like that... he runs +29's but when he gets a chance he always dose community keys and interacts with chat.
[0:37:06] Rhiinehart: have you gotten aotc for the season yet?
[0:37:10] NeeK_23: raw gold at least

[0:39:13] NeeK_23: always welcome to join me Dan, just have to ask
[0:39:27] Pandachoww: pugging raid is tricky rn, groups always fall apart at larodar or nymue and its a nightmare
[0:39:30] RAF_Sean: That's ok so is the rest of his team
[0:39:33] leakies_lil_rat: O.o if u watch Sam then your familiar with ym good work =3

[0:40:18] NeeK_23: no called Drex something xP
[0:40:18] Jkfaked: Just ate some chicken and it's so hot I think I might die, tell my family I love em
[0:40:21] Rhiinehart: im sure that hc augury doesnt exist
[0:40:37] Pandachoww: me and sean cant even join this week....have fun with that :P
[0:40:42] Pandachoww: we have like 5 hrs of dnd
[0:40:44] Jkfaked: spicy yes monkaW
[0:40:52] leakies_lil_rat: @rhiinehart that's what they all say about the orange stick S well
[0:40:55] Jack_the_Dipper: Hot as in good looking chicken Kappa
[0:41:11] Jkfaked: ooh
[0:41:12] ratgefingah: wownews today hype
[0:41:17] Rhiinehart: @leakies_lil_rat i finally got my orange stick Pog
[0:41:21] NeeK_23: @Pandachoww replaced with Molly so we're ok xD
[0:41:24] CpnRad: i had a recipe for korean fried chicken from hello fresh and it was actually amazing
[0:41:28] ratgefingah: HypeCheer

[0:41:45] Amadeous12: :) ok ok
[0:41:47] leakies_lil_rat: @rhiinehart remember to take a screen shot and post it on Sam's discord... <3
[0:41:48] ratgefingah: ye
[0:41:49] Jkfaked: Are you scared wow is making too many changes and going back to "systems" like in shadowlands?
[0:41:55] Pandachoww: which ones are we getting???
[0:41:59] NeeK_23: think 6 total so far
[0:42:07] monstayou7: hopefully warlock
[0:42:11] ratgefingah: I think we will see at least one of each class
[0:42:16] ratgefingah: just a theory tho
[0:42:28] Pandachoww: i really wanna see templar pala
[0:42:28] ratgefingah: that havent been featured
[0:42:52] ratgefingah: I wanna see packleader hunter and the shaman ones
[0:43:03] monstayou7: did you start the 100% journey in BFA? or working back from SL etc?>
[0:43:05] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:43:23] NeeK_23: basically yes
[0:43:56] NeeK_23: frostfire replaces the filler spell in the 2 specs, so technically is all passive
[0:44:11] Rhiinehart: whats the most fun expac to farm
[0:44:30] ratgefingah: keeper of the grove is very passive
[0:44:33] Rhiinehart: bfa world quests were nice to do
[0:44:46] grepew: theres a few different ones, mountain thane buffs thunderclap, frost fire replaces frost and fire bolt and dark ranger gives a new ability
[0:44:58] Paranigmayt: good day :)
[0:45:00] monstayou7: nice, i find ATT eats my frames pretty hard, but i'm running a heap of addons.
[0:45:14] monstayou7: Maybe i gotta ditch Elvui
[0:45:18] Bware2: really hoping for good warlock hero talents :) give us metamorph back hehe
[0:45:20] Lausten: @kingbrthur Yeah to a point where they should just balance talents and abilities instead of thats the case for more specs..
[0:45:25] NeeK_23: honestly the negativity around what people think hero talents are despite how little we know is kinda draining. How about we see them first before jumping to assumptions. Then we can give feedback
[0:46:02] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies ðŸ§¡ https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[0:46:08] leakies_lil_rat: Bfa was stupid when corruptions came out... remember I was a vers bear... with 120% vers before proceeding... shit was great.
[0:46:22] databob1: !emote DinoDance
[0:46:37] leakies_lil_rat: Corruptions took the skill out of the game but it did make it fun
[0:46:43] NeeK_23: calling it covenants 2.0 is disingenuous since the issue with covs was them being locked. hero talents can be swapped in 10secs freely.
[0:46:45] Bware2: wanna join battle... :)
[0:46:46] Jack_the_Dipper: !emote yarrNeat1
[0:47:32] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:48:20] databob1: !emote DinoDance
[0:50:03] NeeK_23: 100% whats good on paper might be shit in practice
[0:50:21] mikeygames: I hope Delves are farmable multiple times a day and not just complete all 12 then be locked out for the week until reset
[0:50:52] NeeK_23: as I understand Delves is repeatable like M+
[0:51:21] RAF_Sean: Years ago I had to stop watching/reading fan videos about Star Wars because of how vitriolic they became. I fear my Warcraft viewing choices are shrinking daily
[0:51:55] DevoidX: vit-ree-oll-ik
[0:52:01] RAF_Sean: Yeah YouTubers/Streamers
[0:52:02] NeeK_23: its meant as a 3rd pve end game content alongside M+ & raid.
[0:52:12] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatREE DUDE!!! CHECK TWITCH CHECK THE DATA @MrGM
[0:52:12] ratgefingah: bro im making so much money from wq with my alt army every 3 days
[0:52:12] RAF_Sean: Basically I don't want to watch and listen to doomer takes all day
[0:52:29] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatXD
[0:52:30] grepew: I am excited for the delves, I really liked visions and torghast but dragonflight lacked that kind of content
[0:53:01] Howlingwolf_1988: @kingbrthur i knoe, literaly doing it atm :D
[0:53:31] Thoreya: so excited to watch alpha 24/7
[0:53:39] NeeK_23: I want good faith arguments, I dont want someone dooming to please wow haters in chat. Equally I dont want to be in an echo chamber. Criticism of wow is important when its done in pursuit of improving the game
[0:54:12] Jack_the_Dipper: Listen: 'first 5 equals 3 classic raid ( my point proven) 1 dungeon( my point proven) 1 retail raid( point disproven.'
[0:54:24] DevoidX: i don't agree with doom-mongering about stuff that hasn't been seen yet.
[0:54:31] ratgefingah: @Howlingwolf_1988 the grind is real
[0:54:46] RAF_Sean: Dan has early access confirmed?!?!
[0:55:04] Jack_the_Dipper: But @MrGM 'retail dungeon equals better classic raids equals better, keep them seperate, no point in wasting resources in retail raids when majority of high end players enjoy classic raids.'
[0:55:11] RAF_Sean: This gameplay is a recording and he's actually in the Alpha right now
[0:55:14] NeeK_23: I just want a wow streamers pre 12pm. Morning watching whilst working is sparce
[0:55:34] Howlingwolf_1988: @kingbrthur would help if i got some gear on most of them, it's sloooow when you are around 405 ilvl lol
[0:55:39] NeeK_23: @RAF_Sean BFA Classic Alpha Kreygasm
[0:56:00] mikeygames: seems a bit short for me to go from alpha to beta, so it must be in an alright hsape
[0:56:02] mikeygames: shape*
[0:56:11] NeeK_23: i havent but happy to check him out
[0:56:23] Jack_the_Dipper: check twitch streamers, see which type of players ( raid enthusiasts vs dungeon enthusiasts aka m+ spammers aka high io chasers
[0:56:31] Jack_the_Dipper: I had such a good time yesterday LUL
[0:56:37] RAF_Sean: He's hosting you on his channel right now and I just got Dan-ception
[0:56:44] Jack_the_Dipper: in school

[0:56:52] Jack_the_Dipper: following class LUL
[0:57:12] Jack_the_Dipper: yep

[0:57:48] BernasPt96: we back here
[0:57:56] BernasPt96: wassup
[0:58:07] Howlingwolf_1988: @kingbrthur i know, but i decided to farm out the expansion so can't allow myself to leave them undone xD
[0:58:26] nash25pl: will all of this completing would not matter when warbands are out since transmog can be unlocked on any class ?
[0:58:41] NeeK_23: happens alot, someone asked me if a trinket was "sim bait" but they have no idea how the trinket worked or what the term sim bait meant. Then they went on a rant complaning with a ton of other parroted buzzwords. I just went to bed
[0:58:46] BernasPt96: whtas the addon u using to know what u doing?
[0:59:19] thunduz: havenâ€™t decided if itâ€™s time to wake up but just incase Iâ€™m here and good morning
[0:59:34] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:59:44] BernasPt96: just curious are u standing or are u sitted?
[0:59:56] thunduz: sleepy today mrgmHehe
[1:00:18] BernasPt96: looks like u are standing ahhaha
[1:00:19] MediumRareOG: I want to know about quest rewards too. It means not repeating Loremaster
[1:00:33] BernasPt96: ahhaah big boyyyy in da house
[1:00:42] NeeK_23: sim bait is when a trinket over performs in sims due to the sim existing in a situation unlike actual content, such that in m+/raid it would actually be worse than it appears. its quite rare for this to be a thing but can happen
[1:00:42] CianoHD3: i dont think it worked that way when it was brought in for if the quest gave the same item types
[1:00:53] mikeygames: they probably haven't thought about quest rewards retroactively
[1:01:04] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:01:10] ratgefingah: otherwise just vendor it then and buyback?
[1:01:21] BernasPt96: any other good addon u using atm? for interface and stuff
[1:01:25] BernasPt96: ui
[1:01:25] MediumRareOG: They've made things retroactive before. When they added tmogs, they added them for quests you've completed for example
[1:01:37] Mordotzz: i wish it would be, even in Emerald Dream, there's 2 quests i need other mogs from.. but its prob too much work for them
[1:01:39] Lausten: Its been so different from expansion to expansion.. Old world you need to do it on each armor type, in Shadowlands you got them all by doing it all once, then in DF you need to do it on each armor type but also spec based, mages wont learn agi daggers from quests..
[1:01:43] nash25pl: I think we will get those once Hero talents had some feedback
[1:01:56] CianoHD3: i think they will do them once the alpha is out so people will be able to see what they are talking about
[1:02:19] BBMezzy: With the lull that we're in, now would be a good time for a new experience/rep buff event
[1:02:52] mikeygames: when WoD was launched my character froze for a solid 5 minutes then the fabulous achievement popped for having x amount ofeach mog
[1:02:57] MuuskeWoW: did you buy the epic edition to get the 3 days early?
[1:03:02] Rhiinehart: we're toward end of season now too
[1:03:09] Duffman1001: When do you think we get an update on season 4?
[1:03:37] athrem01: athrem01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Any alpha soon?
[1:03:39] NeeK_23: content is every 8 weeks, this isnt a lul. its the end of M+ season so people are chilling abit more. Remember the dark times of 9.0 which lasted like 7 months with nothing
[1:03:44] nash25pl: well if you think about it (and i know a lot since its my bread bringing job) a dev cycle works in sprints where sprint have set of tasks completed Them asking for feedback on hero talents means they went threw QA and now in a sort of UAT stage where we get a voice in form of feedback.   So we should in a sense see something about other feature of the expansion once those tasks are finished and tested on their end there is also PTR time where it matter the most when it comes to gamaplay things
[1:03:51] BernasPt96: which edition u recommend buying?
[1:03:52] mikeygames: chased the keyboard up yet?
[1:04:01] CianoHD3: we are 6 weeks into 10.2.5
[1:04:06] Duffman1001: Really struggling with the games content at the minute until s4 :D
[1:04:10] demololtv: do i get legendary this next reset?
[1:04:10] BernasPt96: whats "lul"
[1:04:47] Lausten: Hearthstone Event starts in HS today, wonder if they will announce anything about the wow one soon then
[1:05:21] Thoreya: its cool that they have a team working on midnight as well rn
[1:05:24] grepew: With the march trading post getting revealed tomorrow, do you think it will be full on pirate themed?
[1:05:39] Rhiinehart: next season will be crazy for farming raid trinkets LUL
[1:05:44] DevoidX: lol. if you think public will be part of UAT
[1:05:49] MediumRareOG: I can't bring myself to complete SL. I haven't forgiven Blizzard from polluting bags with anima and having anima currency per-covenant
[1:05:51] nash25pl: you are 100% right they have teams working on mutliple things but them not showing us anything on other features means its not ready at the stage where feedback is the most valuable
[1:05:52] Lausten: @BernasPt96 LUL <-- Kappa
[1:05:54] NeeK_23: its been called Green Theme trading post, so I doubt its pirates
[1:06:04] mikeygames: mountable duck
[1:06:11] Duffman1001: whats the estimated date for 10.2.6?
[1:06:21] Duffman1001: :D :D
[1:06:30] Mordotzz: i got rare drop for nazjatar... im so happy only 2 items to go for bigger bag achievement..
[1:06:30] CianoHD3: @BernasPt96 base if you dont want the mount, heroic if you want the mount and epic if you want 3 days leveling access 30 days gametime, the pet/toy and guaranteed beta access,
[1:06:50] Rhiinehart: siege wasnt that bad LUL
[1:07:00] NeeK_23: do you have the achievement for SoB with all the professions?
[1:07:03] ratgefingah: so you think the peafowl for the travel log and the turtle as tradingpost ware? @MrGM
[1:07:17] NeeK_23: yeah was
[1:07:23] MediumRareOG: The weird thing iss the expansion boost has higher renown than almost all of my toons
[1:07:45] Duffman1001: How close are you to  100% now mate?
[1:08:03] BernasPt96: @CianoHD3 ty
[1:08:20] NeeK_23: sweet AP
[1:08:29] nash25pl: Artifact Power OMEGALUL
[1:08:40] NeeK_23: i dream to think what mine is
[1:08:48] NeeK_23: *dread
[1:08:52] ratgefingah: heart of azeroth in timewalking dungeons is crazy
[1:09:03] nash25pl: islands is good money bringer as all the boe can sell on ah for sort of good money
[1:09:03] havoom01: good day
[1:09:07] Lausten: Wasnt there a ranking on raider io or one of the other sites?
[1:09:12] demololtv: 100 is highest level for it idk what the ilvl is
[1:09:16] NeeK_23: THD still grinds AP so I bet he's high af
[1:09:23] MediumRareOG: I thought about why I don't like Islands. It's because I can't aim for a specific reward. Random island, random spawns
[1:09:33] BernasPt96: getting to enjoy this "hunter" gameplay
[1:09:49] MediumRareOG: Earning doubloons is too slow
[1:10:04] BernasPt96: yep i feel the same im enjoying the stream
[1:10:16] nash25pl: soon @MrGM be a pro mythic raider doing +32keys with no healer comps
[1:10:38] BernasPt96: and u are making me think to buy wow sub
[1:10:53] nash25pl: Tettles thumbnail made me chuckle this morning for last +32 Atal run with no healer
[1:10:59] Mordotzz: i don't do either
[1:11:01] RAF_Sean: Oh you sweet summer child. We're judging the rotation on these dungeon runs too
[1:11:04] BernasPt96: for this content u dont really need a perfect rotation right
[1:11:09] MediumRareOG: For me, high end content is a complete snoozefest to watch
[1:11:10] Thoreya: i do if its a class im tryna learn
[1:11:18] ratgefingah: I like bof, achievement hunters and high end gamers
[1:11:34] nash25pl: @MrGM UI user react when ?
[1:11:41] treavorthenusance: @nash25pl it was only no healer for 2 pulls but really speeds up the run
[1:11:46] athrem01: Only doing it when I watch someone mythic raid on my spec
[1:11:49] nash25pl: yeee
[1:11:51] Rhiinehart: the echo guys are pretty entertaining
[1:11:52] athrem01: To learn
[1:11:52] nash25pl: judge our UIs !
[1:11:53] BernasPt96: do u only play alliance?
[1:12:02] StreamElements: UNUSED Classic WoW Maps that Season of Discovery Could Utilise - https://youtu.be/x5Whfuumtj0
[1:12:07] Hoxza: How do you complete wow?
[1:12:12] BernasPt96: those are the regular dwarf's or the new ones'
[1:12:15] NeeK_23: he only plays good guys, no villians
[1:12:16] nash25pl: @treavorthenusance i guess i did not watch it i just saw JdotB in a jail that made me chuckle
[1:12:46] BernasPt96: the new allied races are kinda coll
[1:12:47] BernasPt96: cool
[1:12:52] nash25pl: so @MrGM when will you judge your viewers UI pepeLaugh
[1:13:00] grepew: RWF and MDI are fun to watch, but I find AWC pvp not as fun to watch, but I enjoy doing pvp rather than watching it
[1:13:10] BernasPt96: @NeeK_23 haahhah
[1:13:12] ratgefingah: Im excited for bearded earthern dwarf women
[1:13:24] Hoxza: is there an addon for it?
[1:13:25] nash25pl: ok ok  Judge on personal level as what you think about it rather than giving constructive feedback
[1:13:34] BernasPt96: my 1st character in wow ever was a dwarf warrior
[1:13:38] Hoxza: completing wow :)
[1:13:47] ratgefingah: how is the lockbox grind on your rogue going? LUL
[1:13:48] yilithas: how many % you got?
[1:14:08] Mordotzz: solid
[1:14:16] Lausten: Hunter
[1:14:27] Mordotzz: yea i dont check quests or so either
[1:14:34] Mordotzz: found it to be inconsistent
[1:15:25] Mordotzz: which one
[1:15:30] Lausten: Example?
[1:15:30] NeeK_23: kinda hope this comes back to M+, people will be so mad
[1:15:44] Mordotzz: oh thought it did
[1:15:52] Rhiinehart: everything
[1:15:58] xHukk: @NeeK_23 No worse that WCM.... imo
[1:16:03] CianoHD3: you could pull alot of the mobs through the walls
[1:16:04] xHukk: than*
[1:16:07] NeeK_23: you could pull mobs from above floors with some abilities
[1:16:12] ratgefingah: if it comes back to m+ ill play mm and troll ppl with barrage
[1:16:15] grepew: Some abilties pull enemies through walls and floors
[1:16:17] havoom01: i rather do tol'dagor than shrine
[1:16:19] Lausten: ATT for sure have stuff it cant track if you've done it on other characters, for example secrets
[1:16:38] aspajil: Hello hello !
[1:17:04] NeeK_23: its things like starfall and blizzard which pulled the most, plus some of the corruptions
[1:17:28] xHukk: I liked BFA

[1:17:44] Rhiinehart: dragonflight have some solid dungeons tbf
[1:17:45] Thoreya: the theme and aesthetic was super cool
[1:17:59] Jack_the_Dipper: Vanilla, Wrath and Legion had for me the best dungeons

[1:18:09] Mordotzz: unpopular opinion but i always liked the idea of pathfinder
[1:18:21] Thoreya: kings rest was super cool
[1:18:39] Lausten: I liked how Dragonriding was part of the questing experience
[1:18:44] Mordotzz: it made you experience the world so differently,
[1:18:50] Mordotzz: yea DF made it work
[1:18:58] Thoreya: i think so yeah
[1:19:05] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:19:10] UlthraneDK: It'll just be dynamic riding by then
[1:19:11] jezaknight93: i know some poeple dont like them but shadowlands dungeons i really enjoyed them :D
[1:19:15] Thoreya: ground mounts irrelevant af now lol
[1:19:47] CianoHD3: only use them in places that dont have flying
[1:20:11] MediumRareOG: Later expansions just added more instant death mechanics to dungeons and raids, which i hate
[1:20:22] ratgefingah: oh thats smart
[1:20:39] ratgefingah: I dont think so
[1:20:45] NeeK_23: not as far as Im aware
[1:20:48] mikeygames: dracthyrs will start at 10, so they would have to change soar
[1:20:53] CianoHD3: not really but they did confirm you will start DF at level 10
[1:21:16] grepew: I wish they did some grounded outdoor dungeons in TWW so I could use ground mounts more.
[1:21:22] ratgefingah: theyll figure smt out I reckon
[1:21:24] Lausten: Borrowed Dragon only knows how to navigate the isles, it need its gps upgraded
[1:21:40] Rhiinehart: i miss my groundmounts
[1:21:48] mikeygames: test it on the ww alpha
[1:21:48] CianoHD3: @grepew we already know there is a dynamic flying one at launch
[1:22:00] Jack_the_Dipper: Hovering will be a problem
[1:22:25] havoom01: get gabin or get going or w/e he saying
[1:22:43] Rhiinehart: any of the old raids ?
[1:22:45] BernasPt96: thre a mount there too always good
[1:22:58] BernasPt96: there is a mount there which is always good tho
[1:23:16] Rhiinehart: dynamic ground mount?
[1:23:34] Rhiinehart: how would that work
[1:23:42] Jack_the_Dipper: They should make flying mounts on the ground slower than ground mounts
[1:23:45] host_255: any traders post info for march?
[1:24:06] CianoHD3: similar to the GW2 mounts maybe
[1:24:14] fooxytv: with the changes to flying having the extra wind effects, do you think they will do the same for normal ground mounts and swimming?
[1:24:21] havoom01: yea im curious about trading post too
[1:24:22] CianoHD3: its something about green
[1:24:36] Rhiinehart: i need a paladin themed trading post :)
[1:25:06] CianoHD3: Green is Good

[1:38:56] ratgefingah: tf
[1:39:00] BernasPt96: Z- XDDDDD
[1:39:09] neverbornlucky: spatial computering is great
[1:39:11] Rhiinehart: ok but what is it
[1:39:12] ratgefingah: pokemon legends arceus in the future?
[1:39:18] ratgefingah: is my only guess
[1:39:45] mikeygames: about as underwhelming as the reverred awards for Azeroth Authority
[1:39:58] BernasPt96: same here
[1:40:21] ratgefingah: has to be x and y followup but in the style of legends arceus
[1:40:59] BernasPt96: @kingbrthur thats a good guess
[1:41:02] neverbornlucky: if its not a pokemon mmorpg I'm over it
[1:41:56] nash25pl: i watched the pokemon and I am crying from joy cant wait for the new legends game
[1:42:16] nash25pl: i have 500h in first one
[1:42:18] nash25pl: KEKW
[1:42:31] BernasPt96: i have all the pokemon games
[1:42:36] BernasPt96: for switch nintendo 3ds
[1:42:43] BernasPt96: pokemmo is nice
[1:42:44] neverbornlucky: been playing last epoch and watching last episodes of last airbinder
[1:43:04] BernasPt96: meh
[1:43:13] BernasPt96: i rather diablo or path of exile tbh
[1:43:21] neverbornlucky: its diablo4 and POE with bad servers
[1:44:11] neverbornlucky: you either have lag, can't load into zones, or can not connect at all
[1:44:28] neverbornlucky: reddit posters
[1:44:47] Elrathir: pretty sure it's an indie dev
[1:45:02] neverbornlucky: last epoch was designed by people who weren't devs just people who wanted a better ARPG
[1:45:19] BernasPt96: its 30â‚¬
[1:45:21] neverbornlucky: 35
[1:45:34] BernasPt96: thats why im saying i rather play diablo or PoE
[1:45:39] BernasPt96: PoE its free
[1:45:46] BernasPt96: and diablo i already got it
[1:45:51] BernasPt96: 3 and 4
[1:45:58] neverbornlucky: I'm just glad to have choices
[1:46:00] BernasPt96: awsome story on diablo 4
[1:46:04] BernasPt96: really enjoyed it
[1:47:07] Rhiinehart: who do you usually watch
[1:47:14] Elrathir: I like Last Epoch of what I've played so far. People say it's less complex than PoE, but more complex than D4 so it kinda has a niche

[1:56:56] bwoods79: i guess by doing your completionist thing you pts for your trading post as well
[1:57:03] StreamElements: UNUSED Classic WoW Maps that Season of Discovery Could Utilise - https://youtu.be/x5Whfuumtj0

[1:57:22] mogaman_: You really should.
[1:57:22] Mordotzz: oh lol
[1:57:27] SskygamesS: they need to do the same with battle of darkshore heroic, you need to have group to run it

[1:57:36] FrostBeered: mrgmLUL mrgmLUL mrgmLUL mrgmLUL mrgmLUL
[1:57:48] FrostBeered: YES! Good call play some wow
[1:58:05] MediumRareOG: The SoD meta of dungeon greinding to levelling and doing quests at max level completely turned me off
[1:58:16] SskygamesS: you need extra player for normal but for heroic you need atually raid group
[1:58:18] ratgefingah: have you done all the magetower?
[1:58:47] SskygamesS: exalty why not let solo
[1:59:07] neverbornlucky: come on blizzard where are those follower AI for dungeon for old Raid
[1:59:13] bwoods79: I really do hope they find a way to incorporate player housing that includes all expansions and features in the game. It could give everyone so much stuff to do if done right
[1:59:41] MediumRareOG: i'll stand by this take: nobody cares about player housing
[1:59:45] FrostBeered: If they did player housing it would be instanced, or the world would be full of houses everywhere
[2:00:09] Rhiinehart: i'd take it
[2:00:15] thunduz: I want housing!!
[2:00:17] Rhiinehart: wouldnt be too bothered
[2:00:17] neverbornlucky: nobody cares about fried mac and cheese
[2:00:18] bwoods79: they say they don't care about it but if in was announced you'd be excited for it
[2:00:24] Jack_the_Dipper: I think we should check Twitch streamers upcoming Friday and see the data on the hardcore wow playing streamers that are smoll and see that Mythic raiding is easy at a certain point of gear you have Kappa
[2:00:35] FrostBeered: they should tie in player housing with the blizzard friend list, you could visit your friends houses that way
[2:00:42] SskygamesS: maybe 10.2.6 is player house Kappa LUL
[2:00:49] RAF_Sean: 9 raiders from RAF_Sean have joined! 
[2:01:00] MediumRareOG: we have garrisons. nobody cares. instance player houses are garrisons
[2:01:00] RAF_Sean: Good good
[2:01:08] RAF_Sean: Just a cheeky little chat with Thom
[2:01:10] Jack_the_Dipper: @SskygamesS LUL
[2:01:13] NeeK_23: Sean fixed wow again

[2:01:43] Jack_the_Dipper: me LUL
[2:01:46] Jack_the_Dipper: two
[2:01:50] ramzie0: Oh what'd I miss?
[2:01:52] dright424: nobody cared about garrisons because you could not really customized them
[2:02:09] ratgefingah: oh ye that happened
[2:02:15] ratgefingah: 150 euros
[2:02:15] MediumRareOG: EVERYONE KNOWS CLASSIC RAIDS ARE HARDER JUST CHECK THE TWITCH STREAMERS
[2:02:19] MediumRareOG: does that feel better?
[2:02:19] ratgefingah: for 2 days
[2:02:21] Jack_the_Dipper: I'm Dutch and I dont like Rotterdam

[2:02:49] Jack_the_Dipper: @ramzie0 There was some kid yesterday in stream telling nonsens and it was so funny
[2:03:03] NeeK_23: networking I think
[2:03:04] nash25pl: @MrGM have you consider mastering cloning tech so you can attend multiple things at once
[2:03:13] Mystic_Bard: I guess blizzcon, but for streamers
[2:03:15] Jack_the_Dipper: @kingbrthur Your just going for the stroopwafels, right?
[2:03:22] Jaythebard: Do you hate or like Marmite i am asking for research reasons
[2:03:31] ratgefingah: @Jack_the_Dipper and the hagelslag
[2:03:39] the_chadillac: If you focus more on killing the rares, doesn't that raise the % chance of getting items at the end?
[2:03:40] ratgefingah: I love hagelslag
[2:03:41] SskygamesS: is that d joke? LUL
[2:03:52] Jack_the_Dipper: @kingbrthur me LUL
[2:03:53] Jaythebard: LOL
[2:03:56] Jack_the_Dipper: two
[2:04:02] Jaythebard: thank you for your contribution
[2:04:06] Jaythebard: Yeah
[2:04:12] Jaythebard: ITS 6
[2:04:14] ramzie0: Is marmite like vegimite?
[2:04:15] Lausten: @NeeK_23 Oh no Dans no no word.. networking LUL
[2:04:20] Jaythebard: and nah a friend was telling me about it
[2:04:47] Jack_the_Dipper: Need to find some more quotas from yesterday
[2:04:47] Jaythebard: i was told you either you hate it or you love it so wanted to know your stance on it
[2:04:50] ruof3: vegemite in us isnt it?
[2:04:54] neverbornlucky: no we don't punish children that way
[2:04:55] ramzie0: what is it?
[2:04:56] Jaythebard: and no my friend is from the UK as well lol
[2:05:00] isillytoy: no its not
[2:05:03] NeeK_23: its the same as vegemite in Australia I think
[2:05:05] ratgefingah: is marmite and vegimite the same thing?
[2:05:07] the_chadillac: Maybe in an international section of a grocery store
[2:05:26] ruof3: oh ok, thought they were the same thing tbh
[2:05:26] MediumRareOG: vegemite is different. vegemite is fire
[2:05:28] Victoriank: I like marmite hate vegemite
[2:05:38] NeeK_23: its like yeast spread, it deserves to be in the trash section
[2:05:49] ramzie0: I saw Hugh Jackman show Jimmy Fallon how to properly eat vegimite. Apparently you're only supposed to use like a thin spread
[2:05:52] CrowMomocle: Marmite is nice spread very sparingly on buttered toast
[2:05:54] Lausten: They're both made from leftovers from other production right?
[2:05:55] ratgefingah: marmite just looks like maggi, we Germans put maggi in everything

[2:06:23] Iwony: Maggi is the firm name
[2:06:31] Sujis: The weird thing is... I think Marmite is ok. Not bad, not good. Just ok.
[2:06:31] LuiBMHunter: Heathen! Marmite is BiS!
[2:06:33] Calicice12: finameLurk
[2:06:40] ratgefingah: +
[2:06:42] Iwony: here
[2:06:43] LuiBMHunter: Nien
[2:06:46] Mona456: Yes
[2:06:47] eb_duck: Ja
[2:06:53] Calicice12: I am German born, but live in the US
[2:06:57] Stormcrone: ich spreche Deutsch
[2:07:34] eb_duck: That's the German name, as a non-german living in Germany, I do find it confusing.
[2:07:35] the_pyke: alles bei uns is verwirrend
[2:07:37] Iwony: I always say Xp for expansion so ... cannot speak for myself
[2:07:37] ratgefingah: I use them both and theres never a communication issue
[2:07:44] NeeK_23: they also call DPS DD damage dealers
[2:07:58] Jack_the_Dipper: In Dutch we call it 'uitbreiding' what means expanding
[2:07:59] Iwony: I guess it is a context issue :D
[2:08:11] CrowMomocle: DD direct damage
[2:08:16] ratgefingah: @Jack_the_Dipper that sounds cursed af
[2:08:18] capncolbeer: Damage-Dealers for DD's?
[2:08:33] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatREE HEY! @kingbrthur
[2:08:48] Sujis: Have we switched as a fanbase from DPS to DD now?
[2:08:51] NeeK_23: the purple boxes are the ones with mounts
[2:08:56] Jack_the_Dipper: Damn Germans stole my bike kaatPout
[2:08:59] Iwony: Dudu = Druid :D
[2:09:03] Sujis: That has confused me coming back after four years of no WOW
[2:09:26] ratgefingah: we also say twink to alt characters which is apparentl wrong
[2:09:38] ratgefingah: why did it post twice
[2:09:45] Mordotzz: im down to do some islands i need the pigmys
[2:09:52] Sujis: No we love twinks
[2:09:52] ratgefingah: aah
[2:10:15] havoom01: erosium yea he got unbanned
[2:10:18] ramzie0: Mfw I learned that "twink" had another meaning outside of wow, lol
[2:10:21] Sujis: If alts are twinks, are mains bears?
[2:10:22] Stormcrone: erosium but I didn't hear about a ban

[2:11:41] FrostBeered: what is gdkp?
[2:12:35] LuiBMHunter: it's quite a big post ...
[2:12:55] NeeK_23: its mostly focused on mythic raiding
[2:13:07] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:13:38] LuiBMHunter: top mythic raiders are tied to the few "meta" classes  if you don't play them - you won't raid at top level
[2:13:42] RAF_Sean: It's a pretty in depth post and not easily summarized
[2:13:47] magemaster225: still using outdated lockout IDs, not flex, not cross-server on launch, etc
[2:13:51] NeeK_23: its not really a complaint, more thoughts on the current situations
[2:14:24] LuiBMHunter: talks about legendary acquisition as well
[2:14:28] Fenundria: adding back PVP islands to the group finder would be great
[2:14:38] bojackhorseman2004: Hello MrGm how is your day?
[2:14:55] LuiBMHunter: do you think normal should be replaced wiv lfr?
[2:15:17] SskygamesS: pls no monkaS
[2:15:35] Mordotzz: i do feel like 4 diff is a bit much
[2:15:37] LuiBMHunter: it's not *that* much harder then lfr - current raid at least anyway
[2:15:43] Jack_the_Dipper: We can check wowprogress how many have done normal compread to heroic
[2:15:44] athrem01: No I loved doing normal when I was starting
[2:15:48] athrem01: And hated LFR
[2:15:48] bojackhorseman2004: I think LFR should have between 10-20 people
[2:15:49] Jack_the_Dipper: DATA!!!
[2:15:58] bojackhorseman2004: LFR always feels like chaos
[2:16:07] Jack_the_Dipper: LEt me check wowprogress
[2:16:14] bojackhorseman2004: and it feels like you dont matter and then you feel like you can just afk
[2:16:18] LuiBMHunter: lfr can be sooo much fun tho :)
[2:16:23] Mordotzz: lfr is fine.. but goddamn please make the mog same as normal then, then it can stay
[2:16:28] Fenundria: what is your least favorite feature of WoW?
[2:16:35] athrem01: @Mordotzz Agreed
[2:16:36] NeeK_23: i think LFR should be replaced with a follower dungeon style solo experience. Normal is aredy easy enough for lfr players. Heroic could be tuned slightly harder. Mythic easy bosses should be tuned harder
[2:16:51] LuiBMHunter: heroic dungeons - they are pointless
[2:16:57] bojackhorseman2004: Yes, we want spicy takes :)
[2:17:22] havoom01: remoove m+

[2:17:59] LuiBMHunter: except for s1 - does anyone ever run heroic dungeons?
[2:18:02] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:18:24] LuiBMHunter: why?
[2:18:26] Rhiinehart: really?
[2:18:30] athrem01: Sometimes with an alt
[2:18:41] zantos2020: I still run heroics because mythics doesn't have LFG
[2:18:42] SskygamesS: so what you do if no m0 is  avaivable for weekly 4 mythics quest? you change to kill 4 boss's?
[2:18:42] Mordotzz: i only do it the mog and manuscripts
[2:18:50] NeeK_23: my truly spicy take. remove PVP from PVE. give them a separate talent tree, stop clogging up the pve tree with pvp bloat
[2:18:57] MediumRareOG: You can just PUG heroics without getting yelled at or having to find a group
[2:19:10] Mordotzz: is follower dungeons faster than a random pug
[2:19:12] bane0808: this is still hard on mythic to solo
[2:19:13] LuiBMHunter: remove horde - all you need is alliance!
[2:19:17] bojackhorseman2004: My least favorite feature is that the game teleports you automaticly to stormwind if you are a new player who reached level 60
[2:19:22] Fenundria: is it possible to solo mythic Jaina?
[2:19:22] bojackhorseman2004: and then tells you to go to the dragon isles
[2:19:29] bane0808: not this boss
[2:19:30] NeeK_23: @LuiBMHunter based and true
[2:19:38] bane0808: opulence and the multi-boss
[2:19:58] NeeK_23: you want to get a Mythic Jaina group going? I canb do the evoker cheese if you want
[2:20:00] adampanerabread: question. if 10.2.6 is a global launch, would it be the first ever retail patch outside of an expansion launch to be a global release?
[2:20:05] Mordotzz: rastakhan is also a road block
[2:20:06] Lausten: @bojackhorseman2004 That used to be the case, now you get a HS to take you there
[2:20:09] bojackhorseman2004: Its not a choice, it automatlcy happens
[2:20:12] Goblocker: its so weird seeing the alliance version of this
[2:20:27] bojackhorseman2004: @Lausten oh nvm then
[2:20:32] bojackhorseman2004: Thanks blizzard for fixing it then :)
[2:20:38] mcmehy: I wish I could level 60-70 in the old one the campaign for the current expansion is done.
[2:21:01] MediumRareOG: 60-70 in TW you can do
[2:21:08] Lausten: Wasnt Legion world wide?
[2:21:26] bojackhorseman2004: can you level in max level zones in chromie time now? used to nto be the case
[2:21:30] bojackhorseman2004: maybe blizz changed that to
[2:21:33] Lausten: Oh right, key distracting me xD
[2:21:35] SskygamesS: we are all wish 10.2.6 this and that and we are going get Jebaited with 5 pirate cosmestics and one new mount LUL
[2:21:42] bojackhorseman2004: ok, then i will complain about that then :)

[2:22:22] neverbornlucky: MrGm its blizzard what could possibly go wrong
[2:22:45] SskygamesS: be hunter and not using bloodlust Kappa
[2:23:08] Thoreya: loved this raid a lot
[2:23:16] dright424: you need an orb

[2:23:36] SskygamesS: time to complain LUL how you playing with servers offline Kappa LUL
[2:23:36] bane0808: you need the orbs
[2:23:42] bojackhorseman2004: the king boss fight CCs you and then it resets
[2:23:52] Iwony: the green ones?
[2:23:53] Mordotzz: the green orbs on the path
[2:24:10] bane0808: only need 1 i think

[2:25:59] Derp2112: when do u guys think they will release the hero trees today?
[2:26:01] Bware2: you can go directly to opulance now.
[2:26:05] bane0808: you can farm normal and heroic tho for GMOD if you dont have that yet
[2:26:09] SskygamesS: HUH
[2:26:12] Elrathir: finish the sentence
[2:26:13] Athriox: HUH
[2:26:14] Bware2: smash Jaina huh?

[2:26:42] Kubwa7: i would body pull Jaina Keepo
[2:26:51] NeeK_23: can you guess what the group is gonna be called?
[2:26:52] SskygamesS: sometimes what dream come out of the mount just natural thing Kappa
[2:27:03] Stormcrone: at least we're consistent

[2:54:55] NeeK_23: fyi the follower rep dailies dont benefit from any rep buffs
[2:54:57] Lausten: Seemed most profession related interviews were just saying, we will do the same but "fix" inspiration..
[2:55:05] Fenundria: it would be cool if WoW came to  current gen consoles
[2:55:28] magemaster225: cant tell if this is an early april fools joke, new product that releases smells into your setup that mimic environments in your game
[2:55:36] neverbornlucky: I just want to do wow on steam deck easier by just steam set up
[2:55:55] NeeK_23: crafting will be cross server in a way with cross server guilds. I half expect crafter guilds to be formed to invite people to make items

[2:58:02] dright424: I think they just keep going, but they might have less of the progression servers
[2:58:08] Phenroi: Make sure to have your cloak!
[2:58:15] LuiBMHunter: was that the one you needed the cloak for?
[2:58:30] NeeK_23: Nzoth is tough since you get phased into top or bottom and you need to be able to kill fast
[2:58:40] LuiBMHunter: your probably need to wear it - not just have it in your bag :)
[2:58:44] Fenundria: I missed out on MoP and Legion. I'd gladly come back to play those expansions
[2:58:58] neverbornlucky: MrGm I'll see you in Shadowlands Classic
[2:58:59] Xesol: last 2 i think yeah
[2:59:32] dright424: I do think that after MoP, we will get another classic fresh progression server
[2:59:43] LuiBMHunter: the purple bits?
[2:59:58] Fenundria: classic WoD sounds like a franchise killer :D
[3:00:03] LuiBMHunter: which time zone you in?
[3:00:20] neverbornlucky: My mom found out what Diablo means in Spanish and said at my sister house I can't play diablo4 . The jokes on her I can play Last Epoch instead
[3:00:27] CrowMomocle: ;you can change the time at Uldum
[3:00:54] ascendence94: @MrGM do u think they dont go past cata cuz  mabey they consider cata as kinda classic and than they might refresh with new servers mabey

[3:02:25] Zuldak: i want to know what happens to player characters after season of discovery
[3:02:38] Goblocker: I know I played Cata but I don't remember much
[3:02:38] Thoreya: cata just means 1 more step till mists for me
[3:02:58] neverbornlucky: cata is when I stopped tanking
[3:03:12] Thoreya: i took a 7 year hiatus from wow bc of cata lol
[3:03:16] Zuldak: I remember scaling in dungeons being way harder than wotlk
[3:03:45] LuiBMHunter: cooooo

[3:21:55] ramzie0: especially since all of the actors thought they were gonna be in the mcu
[3:21:59] Fenundria: Sony is only making these movies so they can keep the rights to the characters.
[3:22:01] nuclearphosphate: @thunduz get in touch with them with a video of the issue, they are really good at getting back
[3:22:02] thunduz: I mean PSA for actors here, if Sony if making your super hero movie run away!
[3:22:04] neverbornlucky: MrGm just remember Kraven is next
[3:22:09] nuclearphosphate: im using the ally MUCH more
[3:22:10] TruVillainManny: Licensing Rights allow them to do this... morality would prevent them.
[3:22:18] nuclearphosphate: cause it can run everything i would want being a windows handheld
[3:22:53] thunduz: @nuclearphosphate thanks
[3:22:59] Fenundria: Kraven can't be worse than the BfA in-game end cinematic
[3:23:17] nuclearphosphate: @thunduz no worries, if u want i have the contact email i can DM you
[3:23:30] thunduz: Kraven is going to be very bad. Especially since he is bite by a radioactive lion and gets animal powers lol

[3:26:14] TruVillainManny: Yellow and Green Rangers passed away. No real hope for a reunion
[3:26:20] TruVillainManny: I think Blue passed as well.
[3:26:37] samwar_: they just did have a reunion film...
[3:26:41] databob1: I went to the theaters for all the spider-man movies because they were worth paying for
[3:26:42] Zuldak: the girl who was the yellow ranger died a long time ago...
[3:26:44] Zuldak: car crash
[3:26:44] Goblocker: Blue was in the last power rangers show
[3:26:47] neverbornlucky: red orginal got arrestted
[3:26:53] TruVillainManny: Yellow Ranger was an accident too
[3:26:56] LordFaunty: just learned the theme was written in a day!

[3:27:03] StreamElements: UNUSED Classic WoW Maps that Season of Discovery Could Utilise - https://youtu.be/x5Whfuumtj0
[3:27:07] samwar_: oh yeah her "daughter" was in the film

[3:27:47] databob1: And the second spiderverse movie...I didn't see the first one until it was on hulu.
[3:27:56] neverbornlucky: MrGm search japanese Spider Man
[3:28:34] Mordotzz: i enjoyed the tom holland ones
[3:28:35] Warcraftthor: Been lurking and thought id chime on the MMPR talk, JDF committed suicide a few years ago and he and Amy Jo Jhonson were in the remake right at the end.
[3:28:40] chelfx: they are
[3:29:05] LordFaunty: sigh....venom...look what they did to my boy
[3:29:10] thunduz: yeah Stan Lee was over in Japan for spiderman and saw either Kaman Ryder or Power Rangers and tried bringing it over here but studios didn't want to make it so eventually a producer brought it to Saban and they made it
[3:29:12] Warcraftthor: I can neither confirm or deny this lol
[3:29:22] databob1: Yeah spiderverse were good I just missed the first one in theaters
[3:29:46] Zuldak: ive seen the linkara history of power rangers
[3:29:49] neverbornlucky: japanese spiderman had a giant robot
[3:29:51] thunduz: for sure!
[3:29:53] TalonBreck: That is SO true!
[3:30:14] databob1: Yeah the art quality was very imersive
[3:30:22] TruVillainManny: I will say really good characterization. So they feel like real characters even though they look stylized.
[3:30:33] Wextak: so today is new promotion ?
[3:31:21] TruVillainManny: 8 today
[3:31:40] neverbornlucky: MrGm can't wait  to buy those new pokemon tcg cards the digital ones
[3:31:42] ijuki: so chat, if I wanted to do a caster, what class would it be? (not bm)
[3:31:44] NeeK_23: in case you forgot, when the shield goes up it reflects damage so dont kill yourself
[3:31:59] Zuldak: be a moonkin
[3:32:01] TruVillainManny: I am so hoping for Farseer or Stormbringer hero talents today
[3:32:08] yuldovah42: hunter is range
[3:32:09] matthewkshearer: normally at 5pm uk time
[3:32:11] NeeK_23: warlock or mage
[3:32:29] havoom01: warlock easiest i  could say,you have voidwalker+ drain life
[3:32:31] ijuki: moonkin it is
[3:32:32] dright424: MM is a physical caster and BM is a ranger melee
[3:32:41] TalonBreck: I've been a Hunter since Classic...yeah, I would say that it functions like a caster, but it has a totally different "feel."
[3:32:43] neverbornlucky: Taliesin is already  mad at priest hero talents
[3:33:18] chelfx: Bm you dont really cast anything its all instant
[3:33:25] TalonBreck: Not weird to me! I love Hunter's! SeemsGood
[3:33:30] thunduz: Like Tali said hero talents should have just been cosmetic
[3:33:47] NeeK_23: 90% of the time when people thing Tali is mad, he's mostly just being British. Snark is our style
[3:33:53] ijuki: well, Iâ€™m in Vietnam so I canâ€™t try it yet
[3:34:00] neverbornlucky: hero talents are just wow sod meets retail
[3:34:20] thunduz: I have so much snark, am I british?
[3:34:30] neverbornlucky: I just want hunters to be tanks with pets
[3:34:35] BernasPt96: is bartender still a thing?
[3:34:36] thunduz: honorary
[3:34:57] ImperfectDark: i would LOVE a hunter tank spec
[3:35:09] CeasiusPls: do the brits develop a snark gland when growing up?
[3:35:22] chelfx: we kinda did the BFD with Hunter Pet off tanking
[3:35:39] bwoods79: the 40 man raids in sod will be interesting
[3:35:43] chelfx: yeah we did that in our raids
[3:35:46] NeeK_23: we need the snark gland to lubricate our dry humour
[3:35:52] LuiBMHunter: can't be true - healers never healed pets in classic :(
[3:36:05] thunduz: with all of this SOD new class combo's I am resisting telling blizz just to give us what we want in retail. You are showing us it can be done!
[3:36:32] bwoods79: I haven't heard anything being that "excited" about self found mode... that is for the super hard core only
[3:36:35] thunduz: makes sense
[3:37:02] NeeK_23: make shaman tanks, make shamans relevant again
[3:37:11] Mordotzz: but then i will never get an inv to raids
[3:37:15] thomssone: its kinda crazy they dont
[3:37:17] thunduz: facts, MRGM be spittin facts
[3:37:20] Taelson: wtf u mean, mages don't need anything xD
[3:37:24] neverbornlucky: MrGm if chat thinks British are snarky they should try hanging out with a true aussie
[3:37:24] NeeK_23: No Dan, leave the locks something to do

[3:37:37] databob1: I don't know what is up with Taliesin lately but he's been very trolling and pissy lately...
[3:37:37] bwoods79: I play a mage. Since everyone has portals everywhere now I feel mages should be able to open the map and teleport to any flight path
[3:37:41] chelfx: locks still have cookies
[3:37:41] TruVillainManny: Hunter Summons!
[3:37:45] Vidaloo: Thematically that makes sense though
[3:37:49] CeasiusPls: locks can get a smol raid buff
[3:37:49] CrowMomocle: gotta love lock cookies
[3:37:49] Taelson: I mean warlocks have a use now, if u give mages that, you'll never need a lock :P
[3:37:54] LuiBMHunter: *achem* 2nd greatest ...
[3:38:05] zombified77: for sure why tie it to a pet stupid
[3:38:22] Lausten: Bloodlust should just be an instance thing imo, to remove it from classes
[3:38:25] Taelson: yea hunt bl is annoying xD
[3:38:39] LuiBMHunter: thinking abouy buying drums so I can lust without a lust pet
[3:38:46] TruVillainManny: What do shamans have again?

[3:39:11] LuiBMHunter: WF totem!
[3:39:12] NeeK_23: and spirit link

[3:39:15] samwar_: lot's of sweet lightning!
[3:39:16] TruVillainManny: heartache
[3:39:24] Mordotzz: but im also not that geared
[3:39:25] LuiBMHunter: chain heal!
[3:39:25] NeeK_23: elemental has good vibes I guess
[3:39:27] bwoods79: they have ankh or whatever
[3:39:41] funviking99: better than brown for warriors LUL
[3:39:42] CeasiusPls: its simple, we kill the batman... err, give every class a raid buff!
[3:39:43] samwar_: two hearths
[3:39:55] TruVillainManny: Remember when Earth Shield was strong?
[3:40:32] zombified77: very ugly
[3:40:35] Zuldak: it's pretty bad
[3:40:36] NeeK_23: hunter sets KEKW
[3:40:44] CeasiusPls: E Y E Belt
[3:40:45] Taelson: Sadge gotta fix my ui
[3:41:00] Zuldak: the 8.3 patch felt... weird andrushed
[3:41:00] HooDGorE: I wish they would implement the Transmog changes. will be running old raids like crazy
[3:41:37] Zuldak: 100% should have been. And killing nzoth and all old gods was... not satisfying
[3:41:37] CeasiusPls: I finally switched to 1440p, now I have more space for all the doodads and flashing lights on my screen

[3:49:57] Mordotzz: it can already track that down
[3:50:04] Taelson: well I forgot that it was called warbands :D
[3:50:04] grepew: With the collection change I can finally collect warglaives
[3:50:06] jdodge1305: I love tmog farming, but definitely will wait until TWW to go back and run everything to make it quicker getting other armor types
[3:50:22] Iwony: Also combined inventorybank :D  I so want it to happen now :D
[3:50:30] neverbornlucky: If I make a alliance character put in my warbands can  I put a horde character in that same warband ?
[3:50:32] Lausten: Hope Blizzard learn from showing something like warbands and not putting a disclaimer on it saying its your entire account..
[3:50:34] DevoidX: would be good if warbands uses your characters as the NPCs in AI dungeons
[3:50:38] Taelson: when is tbc timewalking again, need to get my glaives mog
[3:51:17] neverbornlucky: was just checking
[3:51:29] IAmScarlett__: @Lausten they literally said its your entire account
[3:51:57] Lausten: Exactly, its only for the lock in screen but half the community thought otherwise
[3:52:12] IAmScarlett__: not really lol
[3:52:17] Jack_the_Dipper: Warbounds is coming in pre patch so you can start farming when the expansion releases
[3:52:20] LuiBMHunter: *splat*?
[3:52:20] Lausten: So they clearly failed at communicating that clearly
[3:52:23] TalonBreck: O.O
[3:52:23] Goblocker: so half the community just didnt pay attention?
[3:52:29] Jack_the_Dipper: I mean before
[3:52:31] nyrhalahotep: Welp...
[3:52:31] Mordotzz: told ya i died LUL
[3:52:54] nyrhalahotep: what does the combat log say?
[3:53:03] Mordotzz: he should be doable tho, but cba trying
[3:53:08] neverbornlucky: I predict 10 to 15 years we won't be playing MMORPG's with mouse and keyboard anymore
[3:53:42] Jack_the_Dipper: Also shared personal bank coming with warbands
[3:53:50] Lausten: Your speed depends on how fast you can run irl
[3:54:09] neverbornlucky: makes transfering gold and gear easier
[3:54:10] zantos2020: @neverbornlucky We probably will still be... it's 2024 and I'm still waiting on my flying cars
[3:54:29] TalonBreck: So, I've been out for about a year...what are warbands?
[3:54:58] TalonBreck: Account wide pets for hunters?!?
[3:55:03] thomssone: I hope they will make old reps account wide
[3:55:08] nyrhalahotep: Blizz, let us craft on flight paths. ðŸ˜„
[3:55:11] NeeK_23: and plans to retro actively merge old reps too
[3:55:32] TalonBreck: When will this happen?
[3:55:33] thomssone: oh where did they say it?
[3:55:35] Jack_the_Dipper: Battle pets are account wide unless you mean hunter pets
[3:55:41] NeeK_23: he got 2 orbs probably
[3:55:47] homie_rendy: what difficoulty are u running now?
[3:56:10] TalonBreck: Yes...I actually said, "pets for hunters."
[3:56:11] neverbornlucky: I love my steam deck
[3:56:31] fumennen: @MrGM do you think that we need to got in each character to activate flagging for warbound or will be instant?
[3:56:32] TalonBreck: I am responding to Jack the Dippers question to me.
[3:56:59] Vidaloo: Also aren't we getting like 8 hero talents today?

[3:57:46] NeeK_23: I just hope the bank is a good size. or at least expandable with bags. I dont want it to just be a fixed 200 slots or whatever
[3:57:51] Jack_the_Dipper: I'm not sure hunter pets can be shared, just like soulbounded gear
[3:58:17] grepew: Think the tank debuff from decaying strike hit you in phase 2, it deals 50% of your hp every 2 seconds for 10 seconds

[3:59:08] Mordotzz: try killing the void one instead
[3:59:13] Vidaloo: In P2
[3:59:22] Jack_the_Dipper: Does anyone here use the void bank?
[3:59:31] ramzie0: What ilvl are you?
[3:59:36] grepew: it was the decaying wound dot from decaying strike
[3:59:43] Mordotzz: i use it kinda

[4:05:26] Vidaloo: It did more things back then, but then maybe I remember the Mythic version

[4:29:43] iRegretn0thing: Curious about their green theme for march
[4:29:46] ramzie0: Tom Cat's says that Capn Crackers ends in 25 minutes
[4:30:03] chelfx: They posted the weekly Event 5 minutes ago
[4:30:09] iRegretn0thing: Capn crackers about to die D:
[4:30:23] chelfx: weekly Bonus Event: Arena Skirmishe

[4:30:58] thunduz: mrgmHehe
[4:31:13] thunduz: I need to go back and finish legends
[4:31:15] iRegretn0thing: But definitely could use a new more buffed up switch console for it
[4:31:15] chelfx: lets speed run how fast to take down a twitch stream by watching pokemon on stream
[4:31:33] chelfx: switch 2 is early 2025
[4:31:56] iRegretn0thing: I dream of the day Nintendo goes for PC. Which I  think the world would have to end first.
[4:32:01] thunduz: the switch 2 is a myth
[4:32:33] NeeK_23: I can try to come along
[4:32:45] NeeK_23: yeah
[4:32:47] CeasiusPls: I just want a home console only Switch mini

[4:33:09] bojackhorseman2004: The last massive lore villan :(
[4:33:35] thunduz: I would help but I don't have the cloak
[4:33:37] iRegretn0thing: No, we here to serve M'lord
[4:33:43] bojackhorseman2004: yeah, the last "original" lore villain
[4:33:51] bojackhorseman2004: all the ones we have now are made by modern story writers
[4:33:58] Goblocker: don't forget to delist it otherwise cry babies
[4:33:59] thunduz: I may have an EU account
[4:34:06] bojackhorseman2004: I suppose sargeras is not dead technacly
[4:34:20] iRegretn0thing: @bojackhorseman2004 There are some villains that are still alive that are og still
[4:34:29] thunduz: do i need the cloak to jump in?
[4:34:34] iRegretn0thing: One that comes to mind is magatha xD
[4:34:37] NeeK_23: pandaria entrance right?
[4:34:38] thunduz: damn
[4:34:39] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[4:34:42] bojackhorseman2004: what villains do we have?
[4:34:43] CeasiusPls: ill help out just need to finish this dungeon
[4:34:57] bojackhorseman2004: @iRegretn0thing can only think of Sargeras
[4:35:22] iRegretn0thing: Some of the Dreadlords are still alive
[4:35:31] iRegretn0thing: Most pit lords are technically
[4:35:38] bojackhorseman2004: Denathrius is cool but not an OG
[4:35:39] Iwony: I cannot remember which of my toons have the cloak^^
[4:35:42] thunduz: some how palpatine returned
[4:35:59] DevoidX: illidan can go bad again
[4:36:01] NeeK_23: its a long quest line
[4:36:01] bojackhorseman2004: idk, dont sound very exciting if we cant even mention names of the "dreadlords or pitlords"
[4:36:10] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:37:25] bojackhorseman2004: I think turalyon would make a great villain when he "forces" everyone to accept the light
[4:37:25] thunduz: too bad, should have been a mage to summon
[4:37:32] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[4:38:09] chelfx: lore cant beat shadowlands
[4:38:10] bojackhorseman2004: I want 1 thing from midnight, i want to play on the main continents
[4:38:13] iRegretn0thing: Bring KT back again, Sunwell 2.0
[4:38:16] thunduz: are we going to get a new playable race or new playable class for midnight?
[4:38:37] thunduz: I am not hyped about the earthen lol
[4:38:43] dright424: I don't think turalyon will be a villain, but he will do villainous things that cause him to question the light
[4:38:56] iRegretn0thing: I want to PLAY A DAMN GNOLL
[4:39:01] Goblocker: Spellbreaker as a class could be fun
[4:39:05] bojackhorseman2004: We already know the voidlords are invading using the blood elf well, just make the whole expansion all of north eastern kingdom
[4:39:15] funviking99: Iâ€™ll be mad if we donâ€™t get vrykul race in the last titan , since they update northrend
[4:39:18] thunduz: they should have been customization options not a playable races
[4:39:34] bojackhorseman2004: the problem with cataclysm world revamp was that they tried to do everything at once and not do 1 continent at a time
[4:39:43] iRegretn0thing: Most allied races shoulve been customizations
[4:40:00] funviking99: KomodoHype
[4:40:08] thunduz: ogres please
[4:40:13] funviking99: no, itâ€™s not
[4:40:20] Sleepyjoegaming: hello mate
[4:40:28] thunduz: that would be perfect
[4:40:44] thunduz: yes!
[4:41:04] databob1: yeah that would of been a much better way to do it
[4:41:04] iRegretn0thing: Sounds much less bloated
[4:41:24] thunduz: that is how you do it. Giving us playable races that already exist ruins hype for me
[4:41:27] bojackhorseman2004: It would make sense, but "cuztimasation option" sounds allot less cool than "a whole new playble race"
[4:41:29] funviking99: yeah and not have 100 races that look the same, instead give us more unique races like ogres, vrykul, tuskarr
[4:41:31] bojackhorseman2004: even when they arent a new race
[4:41:39] Sleepyjoegaming: what is it your doing my boy ?
[4:41:49] iRegretn0thing: Holding out for Mon'arch to bring playable Gnolls in the future. All I want ;-;
[4:41:50] bojackhorseman2004: Remember its an expansion selling point
[4:41:59] Goblocker: I would like forest trolls
[4:42:11] Sleepyjoegaming: howâ€™s your day been
[4:42:16] funviking99: can I join too?
[4:42:58] thunduz: I'll join too just give me like an hour to get the cloak and I'll be there
