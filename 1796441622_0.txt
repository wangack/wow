[1:51:12] bistraya_seledka: Enchanting is best money on low level.
[1:51:14] AhoiXCI: start dancing in goldshire for coins
[1:52:27] xmedpakx: cantmake a rod
[1:52:53] Littlehoodie16: the problem with crafting at lower levels is you waste so much material and it isn't worth much of anything to sell.
[1:52:57] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you need minimal tailoring, basically ANY green item, and minimal enchanting: Lesser Magic Want Recipe.
[1:52:57] Fnlx: but in order to be enchanter you need rods from BS :D
[1:53:11] Fnlx: Dont you need 4 different ones ?
[1:53:14] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you can get copper rod from a shop.

[3:18:48] Leightox: omg swifty
[3:18:48] Azure_Wolfy: playing hc while watching your streaming make me die
[3:18:54] Cowardpatty: As feral, you can be annoying and run away and do hit and run tactics, but going toe to toe with any class is not going to work out for you, unless they are a mage.
[3:18:56] Azure_Wolfy: donannan
[3:18:58] n8_2k: @thydiuz main is bloodsail buccaneers
