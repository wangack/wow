[0:04:35] muhayyelaya: What is the name of the addon you are currently using? Your friends' HP bar is shown short?
[0:04:50] palablitz: would you prefer seeing shuffle still rated or give back participation/inflation in 2v2 and 3v3 brackets
[0:06:51] mackingsx: did u upgrade ur stream quality? no 1080p anymore (
[0:07:05] tommywh91: no dh? xD!
[0:07:17] Bicmexwow: @mackingsx it's cause twitch is a bit stinky, if you're streaming in 1440p there's no 1080p option
[0:07:40] Hilding: bicmexGoose
[0:07:40] FoxiekittenWoW: what do you think about rehauling the whole rating system so it became more like leagues with divisions based on a percentage? :)
[0:07:41] mackingsx: @bicmex yeah its so sadge cause my computer is dog so 1440p doesnt work
[0:07:42] Bicmexwow: same thing if you're streaming at 1080p 120 fps, there's no option for 1080p 60fps, you have to go down to 720p 60 fps üò≠
[0:08:42] palablitz: Yeah league rating would be better in a way but rating is not the issue, it's the fact that people afk the game until the last month so they have max inflation to push glad / elite @FoxiekittenWoW

[0:11:12] mvqq: for what
[0:11:17] Krozzyfix: what for the wep or?
[0:11:20] palablitz: @FoxiekittenWoW but what is the difference with what we have now then ? Cuz diamond in league would be like 2.2cr right now
[0:11:21] Krozzyfix: the execute wep?

[0:11:38] HankzEU: @tommywh91 Takk for gave-abonnementet!
[0:11:38] mvqq: doesnt the weapon suck dick
[0:12:08] mvqq: wat
[0:12:19] jenuw1n: nerfed in pvp wednesday i think
[0:12:50] adcotv: @palablitz the main issue is shuffle mmr. Once your cr hits same as mmr you gain 0 mmr for a 5-1 and lose 30 mmr for a 2-4. 3s right now is also crazy. 2.1/2.2 cr is multi glads and r1s lol
[0:13:06] jenuw1n: Extinction Blast damage nerfed by 33% in PvP.
[0:13:25] adcotv: @jenuw1n Where are those nerfs?
[0:13:31] jenuw1n: wowhead
[0:13:40] adcotv: Got link?
[0:13:50] jacknielsen123: ***
[0:13:53] FoxiekittenWoW: @palablitz the difference is that inflation is irrelevant since the different division is based on %, so lets say you need to be top 0.5% to be in "diamond". That way you will always see a progression each season because its not based on a arbitrary number blizzard decides every season
[0:14:01] PartyOnlineTV: Do raiku drink coffee, the answer is no :D
[0:14:09] mvqq: its nerfed by 70% in pvp
[0:14:11] palablitz: @adcotv that's because people in shuffle play to get 2.1 mostly since it's easy to get there
[0:14:13] jenuw1n: dunno if i can link but its here
[0:14:14] mvqq: theres no shot its hitting for 600k
[0:14:14] honeyloop: dh can solo man
[0:14:15] jenuw1n: ***
[0:14:28] Pjbanko: hello hello @Raikubest and chat - im searching an addon execpt nameplatebuffs to track my dots/bleeds on enemy target. the default is too small for me, especially when i have bigger nameplates enabled. any idea which addon i can try to change size of my debuffs on enemy nameplate?
[0:14:32] AstralScare: raiku pve carry
[0:14:49] mvqq: Iridal?
[0:14:56] Nalaa_3: noob
[0:15:01] mvqq: hm ok
[0:15:08] palablitz: @FoxiekittenWoW but there still will be mmr right, like you can't play against bronzes if youre diamond. Only against plat and master. So if diamond is 0.5% you only can play with 1% of the wow population
[0:15:25] asumah_: ur supposed to skip the dragon btw
[0:15:28] palablitz: what they should do imo is just cap mmr for every season at 3.4 manually
[0:15:28] asumah_: its in the route
[0:16:00] STFNxdd: Hmm the timestrike weapons could be good
[0:16:03] joliestarr: @mvqq are weapon embellishments nerfed in pvp?
[0:16:04] gamzzy: dh has a weapon from this dungeon aswell with timestrike no?
[0:16:15] asumah_: abit ahead on %
[0:16:16] taylors09: they just nerfed the pve weapon right
[0:16:18] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Raiku and enter code: ECHO
[0:16:20] FoxiekittenWoW: @palablitz sure, but if you are 2400 now you can also only play with people around your rating and 2400 is 0.3% of the ladder
[0:16:32] FoxiekittenWoW: @palablitz so i really dont see that as a problem
[0:16:37] maybethistimepls: see cdew make an arcane mage?
[0:16:38] palablitz: @FoxiekittenWoW yes so that's what I said so it's the same thing
[0:17:03] tryhard__x: awc tomorrow and my guy is spaming keys
[0:17:30] Hilding: whats for dinner today raik

[0:18:16] taylors09: @tryhard__x practice max pump
[0:18:30] palablitz: @FoxiekittenWoW they should make title %based or just give them for free but let people get high rating again
[0:18:49] FoxiekittenWoW: @palablitz but its not. because one season you could be 3400 rated and the next you would be 2400 but they are essential the same rating in two different seasons. Just like the highest rating in season 1 shuffle were 3600 and now is 2700 os the feeling of progression is lost, cuz you can never hit 3600 rating again without inflation but with leagues system you would never had that problem
[0:18:55] tryhard__x: @taylors09 do you think he is gonna play fire tho?
[0:20:43] palablitz: @FoxiekittenWoW ye i agree bro, so they should just cap the mmr at 3.4 every season and make it go further if needed
[0:20:58] palablitz: i cba getting 2.4 in 2s and sitting 5 minutes queues
[0:21:48] tryhard__x: rather sit 30 min in q for shuffle to go 2-4
[0:22:00] elswavee: u have nothing
[0:22:01] elswavee: on my mage
[0:22:07] elswavee: look at that overall
[0:22:16] honeyloop: is it streamed tmrw?
[0:22:17] tryhard__x: @Raikubest are u gonna stream it tho?
[0:22:27] FoxiekittenWoW: @palablitz sure, but the whole problem imo is the rating numbers i want to eliminate the numbers. But with any rating system you will sit long ques if you are in top of the playerbase
[0:22:35] Malte_L: cursed
[0:23:01] palablitz: @FoxiekittenWoW ohhh, yea but i don't think removing numbers is the way, it's fun seeing +14

[0:26:04] bl_scrublife: ofc you need to break the shield or you keep taking dmg
[0:26:08] Omgg_TV: He has a shield that you need to break through with damage, so yeah you need to do damage @Raikubest

[2:14:56] Banwellx: it just seems like the difference between 40% and 50% haste on mage doesn't reduce casts by .1 seconds. Is it just globals being faster?
[2:14:58] redsilver33: if crit wasn't nerfed in pvp do you think mastery would be stronger
[2:15:26] bootske1: raiku never streams his pov :(
[2:15:38] jasa_indonesia: Hiburan

[3:22:43] animeisrealxo: for a bit
[3:22:47] detectish: shortbus slow
[3:22:50] tmh1995: 80%
[3:22:51] tmh1995: with pvp talent
[3:22:57] detectish: yeah its 80%
[3:23:13] sind233: Yea that is the sp experience
[3:23:23] lilpulsing: looks good ngl
[3:23:27] lilpulsing: cinematic gameplay
[3:23:32] Deathmarkedx: so just stand like a dummy and do pve NOTED
[3:23:36] detectish: jthat just sounds outplayed
[3:23:37] tmh1995: sounds like u synchonized the ingame sounds on evoker
[3:23:41] Loadedmvp: void elf racial :D
[3:23:44] lilpulsing: give back door of shadows, saying this for 2 years
[3:23:46] jmt1616: That's why I play void elf
[3:23:52] wouldyousnack: normal spriest experience
[3:24:03] boblord: need offensive leap of faith EZ
[3:24:07] lilpulsing: YESSSSS but its not lore
[3:24:09] lilpulsing: so can't have it
[3:24:12] lilpulsing: how would we twist it
[3:24:14] lilpulsing: to fit lore?
[3:24:18] OptiTV_: it's because you're using walk instead of run. you can't do that if you're not playing mage
[3:24:20] pazta9: Goblin
[3:24:22] pazta9: For the rocket
[3:24:26] notMyk: EU is just too bad for SP.
[3:24:29] tmh1995: its obvious that sp has the worst mobility among all casters.... thats because we also took the most dmg
[3:24:30] admiraltegetthoff: that fox was the coolest shit LUL
[3:24:43] Nalaa_3: @lilpulsing they just remade shifting power to fit lore KEKW
[3:24:59] dreamawayx: can you tell blizzard to make mind spike instant
[3:25:51] Deathmarkedx: blizzard felt like SP had to cast more KEKW
[3:25:57] Deathmarkedx: they even specified that on the blue post
[3:26:02] tmh1995: tnh you need pretty much for sp. i got a round in 2s were i could freecast because the other dps went on my healer, i did 60k dps. with every other caster freecasting i would easy get 80-100k dps
[3:26:02] pro100shutka: 2Head
[3:26:03] walterwhitesp: how is thje experiment working out
[3:26:06] tmh1995: tbh`
[3:26:17] Deathmarkedx: SP hardcasts the most for sure
[3:26:21] tmh1995: and you need 3 globals with death proc to kill freakin observer
[3:26:23] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Primordial Wave, lava lava Primordial Wave, lava lava Primordial Wave, lava lava Primordial Wave, lava lava  channP channP channP
[3:26:33] Warbayx: i mean how is it even enjoyable to play ele.. i swear its so fucking stupid
[3:26:34] xqzlol1: Do you know if they inflated MMR this week on US?
[3:26:40] Deathmarkedx: i dont think the damage is high enough to warrant all this hardcasting honestly
[3:26:48] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Primordial Wave, lava lava  channP channP channP Primordial Wave, lava lava channP channP channP channP
[3:26:49] admiraltegetthoff: ele is the most underrated spec, it has been op for like 3 expansions now, always under the radar LUL
[3:26:54] walterwhitesp: ele dps just depends on how much you jump
[3:27:03] darkshadow01000: Exactly I think shadow is the only class that has to cast
[3:27:04] Deathmarkedx: @admiraltegetthoff under the radar is a big overstatement man
[3:27:06] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Raiku

[3:27:35] ayosteviey: Ive been keeping track with my toons on NA and theres been little to none
[3:27:49] ayosteviey: Last couple weeks
[3:28:05] albag04: @Raikubest what do you think about Ele shaman in arena for 2s and solo
[3:28:37] ayosteviey: Insane
[3:28:37] tmh1995: i swear obsever from lock is just stronger then sp if i shadow word death with proc hit him he hits me more back and i need ATLEAST 2 Globals to kill it with swd proc
[3:28:49] kebablover55555: there inflation, around 1mmr/day
[3:28:53] kebablover55555: *there is
[3:28:57] Deathmarkedx: @tmh1995 catharsis taps it tho
[3:28:57] LeyIagosa: @tmh1995 OMEGALUL
[3:29:05] phobss: Andreas <3
[3:29:30] ayosteviey: I didnt play a spec for 2 weeks and mmr went up 6 points
[3:29:44] tmh1995: yea catharsis + 4 set, most locks pops observer at the start and i dont have any catharsis to kill him at opener
[3:29:54] wmanrespecter: i dont get why they dont just have natural inflation
[3:30:38] tmh1995: @Raikubest thoughts on whaazz competing awc?
[3:30:39] linuswarlock: Imagine pvers litterally coudnt push rating, there would be an outcry
[3:30:50] admiraltegetthoff: i dont think the season will end soon. New expansion will drop somewhere in autumn and theres no way we get a 5+ month fated season
[3:30:54] maybethistimepls: i mean 4k rating seems pretty disgusting
[3:31:01] walterwhitesp: hey, just play SP, you wont reach mmr cap anyway
[3:31:14] admiraltegetthoff: season will last another 4+ months
[3:31:26] tmh1995: @walterwhitesp sp has hits on mmr cap 600 below the 600 already missing
[3:31:39] aremyys: Jaime is just insane
[3:31:46] jmt1616: You like mind spike more than mind flay?
[3:32:01] albag04: @Raikubest what do you think about Ele shaman in arena for 2s and solo
[3:32:04] Scirocco2k17: april / may season 4
[3:32:20] archtme: didn't you play with him on lan?? did he play noticeably different?
[3:32:22] welaxoxo: kickbotting?
[3:32:28] Akrololz: whaazzHUH
[3:32:33] cmxmage: can we have ADs now so we dont have it in solo shuffle @Raikubest ? thank you <3
[3:32:34] maybethistimepls: its not a full bot though, just knock and shear
[3:32:35] Shchoorw: Feels like this is only 1 guy who's hands on decisions on inflation. Because nothing changes from season to season,same story every time
[3:32:55] ayosteviey: Ive been watching most of yours 3s sessions from the lat couople months. His gameplay is sus sometimes
[3:33:08] wmanrespecter: the guy doing inflation probably on vacation thats why were not getting inflation
[3:33:09] DarkChar: is he sus of using kick bot?
[3:33:18] cmxmage: @DarkChar who exactly?
[3:33:28] Warbayx: i mean all he had to do is stream his games and show keyboard input.. It would be so easy to disprove it
[3:33:30] moreten_: Shadow priest is so sad
[3:33:42] mumleon_: i think they dont care so much about pvp that they dont have anyone who does it

[3:33:59] cosmo30k: did it feel different when he was playing blizzcon with you guys?
[3:34:01] linuswarlock: cc changes tho

[3:34:24] welaxoxo: small thing to tfix
[3:34:28] welaxoxo: big impact
[3:34:36] Bashy_89: they just didnt want it to be like s2 SL
[3:34:38] moreten_: Its so much grind, i would just like WoD with mythic + it was fun
[3:34:47] Melvred: rewards
[3:34:47] cmxmage: is jamie banned or what KEKW
[3:34:50] kebablover55555: what is best expansion for pvp then?
[3:34:50] Nalaa_3: ssn 1 only good season this expansion
[3:35:05] cmxmage: @Raikubest  can you do some ADs now so we dont have it in SS? tyty
[3:35:06] linuswarlock: 7,5/10 with the cc changes
[3:35:27] cosmo30k: im gonna play devils advocate here and say that a considerable part of the problem is also just lower activity aka not enough people playing, cant just inject mmr into an elo system for no reason
[3:35:30] welaxoxo: ret paladin
[3:35:34] welaxoxo: for sure
[3:35:37] blueberrypieface: LOL
[3:35:39] blueberrypieface: wtf
[3:35:55] tmh1995: @Raikubest no worries u cant reach that rating this ssn on sp
[3:35:57] kebablover55555: mmr guy) but they may not even have a pvp guy
[3:35:59] Warbayx: @Raikubest why does jaime not play in a tier1 team anymore? are ppl sus of him
[3:36:34] tmqwow: 7 raiders from tmqwow have joined! 
[3:36:35] wmanrespecter: i really wish blizzard didnt treat pvp as like a mini game
[3:36:48] blackvpnv: i prefer the s1 mmr
[3:37:05] Nalaa_3: ok let me correct myself, the middle of season 1 was good start was bad and ret patch was bad
[3:37:48] kebablover55555: any idea how koreans can get to 4k rating then?
[3:38:00] kebablover55555: *taiwan people
[3:38:01] Braunijs: Wasnt it inflation that pushed the mmr cap above 3.3 ?
[3:38:07] Braunijs: it was close to 3.7 at end i think
[3:38:09] mumleon_: blizzard always fixes things right at the end making the change useless af
[3:38:24] nickfr0stt: no its 1/10
[3:38:37] Shchoorw: Mmr guy is too scared to fk up
[3:38:58] moreten_: Everythibgs turning to shit
[3:39:00] wmanrespecter: i rather they fuck up trying something new than this
[3:39:02] nickfr0stt: why is it 2 not 1
[3:39:09] nickfr0stt: what is good about this expansion
[3:39:34] rollinsthechamp: @Raikubest Prime Raiku or Prime Maro
[3:39:34] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Raiku and enter code: ECHO
[3:39:45] cosmo30k: is it really something you can just "fix" though? if theres less people playing there will naturally be less MMR because low rated people give mmr to the people above them and so on
[3:39:45] wouldyousnack: i dont think net addon will be better ngl
[3:39:47] admiraltegetthoff: taiwanese ladder looks sus LUL 4k cr with negative win/loss interesting xd
[3:39:53] Joke_Fistweaver: why 10pm?
[3:39:57] pazta9: The gearing and gameplay is fun the arena systems and ques just fkn sucks its crazy bad
[3:40:07] Delxenyo: Just remove solo shuffle
[3:40:32] wouldyousnack: @Delxenyo this would be soooo good i swear
[3:40:41] Joke_Fistweaver: why is that though?
[3:40:45] Joke_Fistweaver: cus people work during day?
[3:40:47] Braunijs: Whos the best solo shuffle player in your team ?
[3:40:49] walterwhitesp: shuffle is great
[3:40:59] Deathmarkedx: they are not removing shuffle
[3:41:02] Deathmarkedx: relax
[3:41:04] walterwhitesp: can just q up and play
[3:41:18] aremyys: people work / study and can play around that time
[3:41:20] pazta9: Yea shuffle is the best thing about df
[3:41:24] khrylx_: the good thing about shuffle is that u can just play whenever u feel like it, and not sit in lfg forever
[3:41:37] Tiqmah: not having to look in lfg is the best thing ever
[3:41:45] Delxenyo: You are talking from a rank 1 perspective
[3:41:45] archtme: how much haste should I have as fire ?
[3:41:45] cosmo30k: at the very top, yes
[3:41:52] Delxenyo: Im talking from a 2000 player
[3:41:52] Melvred: Why not add ai healers in a bracket
[3:41:55] Delxenyo: Shuffle si horrible
[3:42:06] boujah: shuffle is fun
[3:42:08] Delxenyo: Ah okay
[3:42:14] aufgosh: top 2%, so 1800 and upwards? Kappa
[3:42:21] sind233: Suffering from success LUL
[3:42:22] pazta9: @delxenyo how the fk is shuff horrible its Great
[3:42:26] barapersson: @Delxenyo Shuffle is great for all players, casuals benefit more than top tier players
[3:42:34] moreten_: @raikubest What buff does s priests need?
[3:42:42] Delxenyo: At my 2k rating I sit 27min in que just to get into a match where 1 guy ragequits after I lose 2 rounds and i lose points
[3:42:48] Braunijs: balance is pretty decent tho
[3:42:52] Braunijs: compared to slands
[3:43:00] 00ZZEE: if people troll/rq the system is not bad, its the players
[3:43:06] tmh1995: ill join the fun and que a shuffle on my sp too
[3:43:09] mumleon_: thats your personal exp, most people find shuffle really good feature
[3:43:33] cmxmage: i played today some arena and I lost rating with our 2.1K CR team against 2.5K CR Teams, it's insane
[3:43:39] Melvred: Ai healers could fix q times
[3:43:49] guccish0t: there is not many ppl who leaves after they lost rounds
[3:43:58] vitalbrahh: there are already ai healers its treants
[3:44:02] tmh1995: got an insta pop kms
[3:44:07] moreten_: Haha i would not want ai healers at 2k+
[3:44:22] tmh1995: i queued as heal fml
[3:44:32] Melvred: Then make ai healers optional choice I don't want to wait 30 min
[3:44:35] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Raiku
[3:45:00] tmh1995: was about to flame thats war dk dh affli then realized there is a dps to much xD
[3:45:35] mumleon_: ai healers for shuffle has to be the most under 1k cr take ever LUL
[3:46:30] badmy__: why do you think AI should be lowrated? openai dota bots are stronger than pro players
[3:46:48] badmy__: blizzard can pay a few K to build some nice heal bots
[3:46:56] Melvred: There ar3 literally heal hots playing at 2k
[3:47:04] Melvred: Bots
[3:47:11] admiraltegetthoff: why does mmr matter, its just numbers. You wouldnt get faster queues if you played 500 mmr higher or am i missing something
[3:47:26] Melvred: If they added it q times would be instant for dps
[3:47:31] khrylx_: @admiraltegetthoff ppl would be more incentivized to play since glad etc becomes more reachable
[3:47:31] iamhereitisme: how long r his qsd
[3:47:44] jilmo: Who is healing for you guys now?
[3:47:58] stacyer: @admiraltegetthoff low rated players usually play for rewards like 1.8k or gladiator. MMR being low means a lot of people can't reach their goals = bad pvp participation
[3:48:01] NiborWoW: @jilmo Lontar i giess
[3:48:33] Holyxyz1: went from 2653 to 2650 ye
[3:48:33] blueberrypieface: i saw a post on reddit about it, it went down 3 points
[3:48:36] Holyxyz1: to 2657
[3:48:36] sind233: I support you mr. Racoon!!
[3:48:43] Warbayx: Does have have a pathway to return for Echo? or is it over for good
[3:48:50] Warbayx: @Raikubest mehh
[3:50:12] Warbayx: i guess it depends on how well you guys do?
[3:50:22] Melvred: It is ridiculous to wait 30 min
[3:50:34] Deathmarkedx: yes it is. no matter the rating
[3:50:37] Melvred: They should be ashamed
[3:50:38] kebablover55555: i feel like the worst problem of arenas is repetitiveness. Same arenas for 20 years, you get 1 new per expansion. And in shuffle it's even more boring, because for some reason they use like 1/2 of arena pool and dont change it from season to season
[3:51:30] moreten_: That‚Äôs not a lot, more fooooood
[3:51:59] mumleon_: @kebablover55555 really?  i was feeling really off that i never see kyrian arena or  blade's edge LUL
[3:52:05] Deathmarkedx: pasta is too heavy for this hour
[3:52:09] Deathmarkedx: fk that
[3:52:22] moreten_: More oats maybe and shop tomorrow
[3:52:27] blueberrypieface: a nice big greasy bhorgir for practice with chan
[3:52:28] stillthechamp: when is awc?
[3:52:35] lmaoerss: confident for tomorrow?
[3:52:40] sind233: Oh man that time schedule is fucked
[3:52:41] Deathmarkedx: ok then  you can eat something big yeah
[3:53:04] blackvpnv: nobody play morning
[3:53:05] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[3:53:08] kebablover55555: @mumleon_ yep kyrian is good, not included in shuffle like many others
[3:53:30] badmy__: @kebablover55555 some arenas are too small or laggy, and dalaran is too hard to make fountain work for blizzard devs :)
[3:53:35] sind233: Lontar knows that military falling to sleep secret tech
[3:53:52] Anabolixtv: YES! Raiku SP lezgo
[3:54:00] Deathmarkedx: kyrian is bis arena
[3:54:05] Deathmarkedx: sadly its a flashbang
[3:56:02] Deathmarkedx: did you forget to change driven
[3:56:09] Deathmarkedx: for trauma
[3:56:31] alireza00700: ele is more fun or arms? @Raikubest
[3:56:34] cosmo30k: this is def a 6-0 druid
[3:56:43] cmxmage: always these complete melee comps
[3:56:44] cmxmage: its insane
[3:56:45] cosmo30k: full pve lobby as disc
[3:56:58] Anabolixtv: bit rough kekw
[3:57:05] Anabolixtv: his mog also gave it away sadly
[3:58:08] moreten_: @raikubest What has been your favourite class in dragonflight?
[3:59:05] Deathmarkedx: your pvp talents
[4:00:59] Chanx: 343 raiders from Chanx have joined! 
[4:02:27] gregl__: thoughts on da vs void form

[4:10:13] sai1on: what classes u prepared for awc?
[4:10:16] sai1on: or it's secret?
[4:10:19] flennx: all stars aligned for once so you could land a fear and you spaced out and ran into the wrong direction LUL
[4:10:19] kebablover55555: uh dk doesnt have ms?
[4:10:20] sponkss: how high is raikup
[4:10:34] KimTaekShin: Andreas ber√§tta lite om vad du dricker f√∂r Nocco just nu
