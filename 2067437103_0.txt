[0:54:20] Nice_n_Dicey: it's always more a pain in the ass if you are sellign a shared ownership/housing assosciation property
[0:54:56] Ambersulfr: is there any way that I could talk you into looking at the pvp mmr system and rewards structure?
[0:55:20] Nice_n_Dicey: get the valuation done and get a mortgage agreement in principle done asap for the new purchase and then you can move quickly

[0:55:54] Ambersulfr: I know it's random but it's an under-loved area of the game that blizzard has been ignoring a bit.
[0:57:12] NeeK_23: Plenty of PVP creators have brought it up already.
[0:57:20] Kindosar: that would be something to do in like a Venruki stream tbf.  He's got a loud voice in the area so if its new, then that's where I would go.
[0:57:40] bwoods79: On a positive note, spring is 29 days away
[0:58:31] NeeK_23: no offence to Dan, but if he started making PVP recommendation videos, the pvp community would tear him apart as not being "one of them"
[0:58:31] Ambersulfr: that's fair
[0:58:53] SlithTheSivak: we need an epic dragon riding battleground, 40 v 40, all in the air, dragonlances
[0:59:11] CerebrillUK: thats a fair thing during interviews, especiallty if its not a topic you know much about.  but the pvp creators never seem to get interviews unfortunately
[0:59:15] Lausten: "Sorry I got no idea what im even asking, I was just told to ask this random question by a viewer" - That gotta be the worst replay to have to give.. Totally get ya Dan..
[0:59:17] Mordotzz: yea not good to ask random questions u don't really have a solid opinion about. Goes for anything in life
[0:59:29] Ambersulfr: That's why it's stressful @CerebrillUK
[0:59:32] NeeK_23: mounted combat? that is this Wrath box features LuL
[0:59:41] mikeygames: any thoughts on where to get the bengal tiger mount? :)
[1:00:09] mikeygames: nope, the old bengal tiger that was never implemented, it's in the sod p2 files
[1:00:12] Mordotzz: if it was answering questions from chat while live, it would be different for sure
[1:00:17] NeeK_23: do you have all runes now?
[1:00:19] Ambersulfr: If they ever gave interviews to the pvp community I wouldn't even be asking.
[1:01:15] keyboardturner: bengal tiger was in STV rumor
[1:01:19] keyboardturner: it was some private server thing
[1:01:31] NeeK_23: it was given to a sick kids make a wish i think

[1:33:09] BBMezzy: Full is full, you can't help that
[1:33:40] RAF_Sean: Maybe closer to the date send an email to all the ticket holders asking them to confirm attendance. Then you might get some open up and can do another wave
[1:33:59] NeeK_23: just be honest. its the first iteration of LFG. there's gonna be pinch points you can work on next time. If there are returns closer to the time, you always have the existing waitlist to contact on a firstcome first serve basis
[1:34:14] RAF_Sean: What aspects of the set up are limiting capacity?

[1:43:15] RAF_Sean: Dan about to zone right into the War Within alpha
[1:43:46] Vidaloo: Hi, that was just a rumor though. It never happened in the game. But do you think they did that for SoD?
[1:43:55] Lausten: @UlthraneDK There aint, they've been oursourced to auto bot replies LUL
[1:44:14] ratgefingah: thats wild
[1:44:18] SirRobHiFi: I think I 'discovered' an anti fly hacker change by Blizz in SoD - No chests in Uldaman. I ran it a few times and the normally spots were empty.
[1:45:00] SirRobHiFi: 5 man Uldaman
[1:45:01] keyboardturner: modCheck
[1:45:18] SirRobHiFi: 1 spot is in the pit by the enchanting trainer
[1:45:24] Lausten: @SirRobHiFi They have hinted at some new anti bot stuff in the works havent they? Chat?
[1:45:53] nyrhalahotep: the videos textures are different, he just has different colors settings
[1:46:02] nyrhalahotep: aren't different
[1:46:19] Lausten: Think its just different due to time of day
[1:46:28] NeeK_23: blind leap, what can go wrong?

[1:47:12] cara8901: pgeFloor  <3
[1:47:16] keyboardturner: he was trying to aim a specific direction
[1:47:22] CardinalTX: we go again!?
[1:47:28] keyboardturner: it's a narrow path
[1:47:31] BBMezzy: He turned a little before he jumped
[1:47:33] cara8901: its the center of that little triangle
[1:47:34] KaisenSiru: devoTEARS
[1:47:37] keyboardturner: you were too far right
[1:47:40] CardinalTX: oh he did

[1:51:13] keyboardturner: to mess with you
[1:51:28] Lausten: I bet its from that faction that people havent gotten enough rep with yet
[1:52:08] RAF_Sean: Ok gotta get ready for Pilates, gonna leave you on for Shadow - Please don't ask her if she wants a treat ;)
[1:52:11] NeeK_23: im not convinced Blizz would add it in such a hard to reach place, even in SoD
[1:52:32] SirRobHiFi: If this is actually there maybe we should start fishing for the legendary

[1:58:27] Demeternoth: They will have had a crib sheet on who is going to be there XD
[1:58:36] Lausten: Ear piece, people in the backroom feeding them info
[1:58:43] nyrhalahotep: I usually watch anywhere from 2 to 5 at a time switching back-and-forth
[1:58:45] NeeK_23: arent alot of them interlinked? like if you know one you know the others?
[1:59:00] nyrhalahotep: but I'm ADHD AF

[2:00:05] hJam_: what addon is it?:)
[2:00:09] tyclonic: I feel like some that did get nominated don’t really play and just chat about MMOs haha 😂
[2:00:11] MrGM: !classicui
[2:00:11] StreamElements: You can find my Retail UI for  Classic Era pack here: https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1729106254759350507
[2:00:32] hJam_: tytyt
[2:00:44] tyclonic: I mean I wasn’t gonna say names but yes asmon
[2:00:55] Lausten: A dyslexic Danish Childrens TV host/reporter/what ever, had an earpiece for years, he had a guy sitting in the backroom guiding him instead of having a teleprompter..
[2:01:04] ImperfectDark: it's not even alive yet
[2:01:09] Lausten: So I bet info is fed to those hosts that way
[2:01:20] NeeK_23: its just Bell's mate complaining
[2:01:22] keyboardturner: react streamer andy pipeline
[2:01:30] ratgefingah: asmon is a reactionary streamer
[2:01:32] kinetico9768: video was about hero talents
[2:01:50] Lausten: Ah the hero talents
[2:01:54] JakeSezz: Whaaaaaat?! Bell and some of those around him complain?! mrgmO
[2:01:54] Lausten: Too complex
[2:02:30] kinetico9768: lack luster hero talents, complicated, people want class skins
[2:02:31] NeeK_23: Bad faith arguments to draw clicks, Bell knows the way to get clicks
[2:02:35] JakeSezz: But if they were simple it’d all be “wtf why can’t they make these more in-depth”. Fucking whiners, dude
[2:02:37] Lausten: Thats more Asmongolds take on it to be honest.
[2:02:52] keyboardturner: everyone has their own impression of what they should be, not what they are. people want them to be a class overhaul or a class skin. they're just meant to be some flavor with some extra taletns without revolutionizing the rotation
[2:03:05] BBMezzy: The feature they put feedback threads out on the (US) forums on so that they can still be changed..
[2:03:31] Lausten: I must agree though, theres too many x %  increase y spell by z amount while dancing naked in the rain.. The code and balance gets too complicated AGAIN..
[2:03:36] keyboardturner: it is that, it's just some very basic aesthetics mixed with some pretty standard talents
[2:03:40] SirRobHiFi: Blizz has spent years giving every class versions of the same abilities, perhaps they are rewinding that a little.
[2:03:42] NeeK_23: most of them are passives, maybe one extra button
[2:03:45] JakeSezz: @keyboardturner saltyb27Cheers saltyb27Cheers
[2:04:00] keyboardturner: RareParrot
[2:04:07] magemaster225: I think peoples problems are just that they are forcing a type of class fantasy onto players that may not like it
[2:04:34] keyboardturner: @magemaster225 that i can definitely understand at least, the worry that you'll be required to be like dark ranger if you want to be optimal
[2:04:39] Lausten: @NeeK_23 Thus making them COMPLETELY obsolete, just increase the base damage of the skill, all those increase y by x talents are so boring
[2:05:14] Lausten: Use your camera
[2:05:29] Lausten: To scout through the tree foliage
[2:05:40] airplug: go more left
[2:05:50] keyboardturner: I think you're facing the right direction

[2:07:59] CerebrillUK: NICE
[2:08:04] NeeK_23: @Lausten passive doesnt mean just % buff. I mean not having 2-3 extra button bloat. adding nuance to rotations is fun and interesting.
[2:08:52] keyboardturner: spam jump toward left than right
[2:09:09] NeeK_23: F5 to quicksave
[2:09:46] keyboardturner: modCheck
[2:10:00] keyboardturner: the immersive experience
[2:10:25] Lausten: @NeeK_23 Its a cool way, but there is some of them just adding 3 more moon power to balance, just make that baseline if a talent is needed, but I do agree with passives minimizing button bloat, cause fuck button bloat..

[2:13:35] Akela3: yeah its true
[2:13:47] keyboardturner: no
[2:14:02] SirRobHiFi: Yes, true, in fact attempting to link unseen items used to cause instant disconnects
[2:14:04] keyboardturner: you can load items like hearthstone compass rose mount even though nobody's seen it

[2:16:55] Lausten: Thats been there since Classic
[2:16:57] SirRobHiFi: Uldaman chests hypothesis: two spawn points are Enchanting vendor and the hall before Stone Sentinel boss. Usually one or other would be up, 50% chance locked.
[2:17:10] nightbot_v19: say SoD Phase 2.
[2:17:24] Lausten: They had the old Thottbot database,so they implemented the comments into it
[2:17:39] nightbot_v19: xD
[2:17:51] keyboardturner: new stream: escape from the bengal tiger cave
[2:17:59] tyclonic: got sleeping bag? have a mage liminal passage to you and port ya
[2:18:00] BBMezzy: You'll have to just become the vendor of the cave then. It's your new home
[2:18:39] Mordotzz: looks very done to me
[2:18:51] abherb: I remember that bengal tiger mount, it was given to 1 player in the game in retail, as part of "make a wish",
[2:18:54] NeeK_23: i love how the devs were like, no one will ever see this, just untexture it
[2:19:07] Lausten: I mean it would pass QA for DF right? Kappa

[2:26:09] keyboardturner: i personally can't find a key atm but i can try to double check
[2:26:21] SirRobHiFi: Uldaman chests hypothesis: two spawn points are Enchanting vendor and the hall before Stone Sentinel boss. Usually one or other would be up, 50% chance locked.
[2:26:52] SirRobHiFi: I think they might have deleted them to combat the rogue flyhackers
[2:27:03] nightbot_v19: raid  Gnomeregan drop mount  1.40% DinoDance
[2:27:07] nightbot_v19: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13325/fluorescent-green-mechanostrider#dropped-by
[2:28:07] Lausten: Because they finally hit 25 with the XP buff LUL
[2:28:20] keyboardturner: as far as I can tell there's no encrypted tied to the current db2
[2:28:27] mikeygames: that's odd, the 'uninstanced' version of zg, is the 'newer' map
[2:28:44] Hotstitute: omg... is he doing it?
[2:29:34] Hotstitute: melee specialist? :O
[2:29:46] Hotstitute: oh..
[2:29:49] Hotstitute: its time consuming
[2:29:58] Hotstitute: dark riders
[2:30:21] Hotstitute: kill 7 level 40 elites with 12.5k health scattered across the world
[2:30:33] keyboardturner: they did have a new spell made for the mount, they didn't just use the old item spell mount
[2:30:36] Hotstitute: kinda
[2:30:39] keyboardturner: the spell is not removed
[2:30:44] keyboardturner: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=436327/bengal-tiger
[2:30:59] Hotstitute: Melee specialist is a beast tho
[2:31:56] Raxus: what do you think 10.2.6 is gonna be?
[2:32:06] Hotstitute: it makes your raptor strike 3seconds and hit with both weapons.. if you use the same weapon you gain 30% damage increase
[2:32:23] Hotstitute: two swords and such
[2:32:49] Hotstitute: melee is crazyyy good
[2:33:07] Hotstitute: give it windfury or wildstrikes and its just nuts, each hit can proc it
[2:33:55] nyrhalahotep: had to step away for an emergency, what happened with the cave?
[2:34:04] Hotstitute: Raptor Strike cooldown reduced to 3 sec and is now instant, Mongoose Bite cooldown removed, and Raptor Strike has a 30% chance on each attack not to trigger its cooldown.
[2:34:07] Hotstitute: thats melee specialist
[2:34:22] nyrhalahotep: oh, like IRL, disappointing.
[2:34:38] Sindragozer: MrGM Pog hows it goin
[2:34:59] Sindragozer: gz on 40!
[2:35:16] Sindragozer: hit 40 the other day too :D
[2:35:28] Hotstitute: DID YOU KNOW, XAL'ATATH IS BACK IN SOD
[2:35:29] Sindragozer: is the bengal tiger one of the STV mounts?
[2:35:38] Mordotzz: Are you still doing those profession shorts, those Easier one that you could do on any character

[2:35:53] Hotstitute: there is a tiger mount attached to the bloodmoon vendor
[2:36:09] Hotstitute: idk, its alot of gold coins lol
[2:36:10] Mordotzz: and perhaps others noting the prof achieves that take long to do, so better start now etc
[2:36:16] Sindragozer: is the bengal tiger attatched to something?
[2:36:33] adampanerabread: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=216570/reins-of-the-golden-sabercat
[2:36:41] Duffman1001: We got any guesstimates for Season 4 dates?
[2:36:42] Hotstitute: do you have atlas loot SOD?
[2:37:00] Sindragozer: 1 kill is a copper. 100 copper is a silver
[2:37:01] BrotherDanTV: 100 copper coins = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold
[2:37:05] Hotstitute: 100 copper coins into 1 silver, into 1 gold
[2:37:07] Hotstitute: and so on
[2:38:00] nyrhalahotep: oh, that's rather profound as blood often tastes of copper
[2:38:12] Hotstitute: its a bad idea
[2:38:28] Sindragozer: Pog thats awesome
[2:38:28] nyrhalahotep: mrgmToast mrgmToast mrgmToast mrgmToast
[2:38:52] Hotstitute: im 100% convinced that the bloodmoon is a tester for the Void Crystal pvp zone
[2:39:22] Hotstitute: i mean being a GM, you will probably get an alpha invite
[2:39:28] Hotstitute: so show some zone footage and yeah
[2:39:29] bwoods79: The other thing people are doing with shorts is saying "part 1" part 2 etc. so if they watch part 1 and want to see more it makes them go to your channel to find other stuff
[2:40:13] Lausten: Just call it deep dive, then they cant be mad its not new info LUL
[2:40:37] Hotstitute: So... you should probably make a class quick look, a hero spec quick look, a zone and flying
[2:40:49] Hotstitute: cos war within is about to get all the SoD players playing again i think
[2:41:39] bwoods79: break it up into parts so people look for the other parts to it

[2:49:11] Sindragozer: LUL
[2:50:28] adampanerabread: how long does the bloodmoon last?
[2:50:29] Sindragozer: you can do it, i believe in you
[2:50:36] Lausten: You're a hunter though, easy peacy
[2:50:36] Sindragozer: 30 min @adampanerabread
[2:50:57] Sindragozer: it starts about 30 sec after its supposed to
[2:51:29] adampanerabread: I did give up but I don't lose anything for checking the ZG tiger place and missing a bloodmoon event
[2:51:34] Sindragozer: empty keyring FeelsBadMan
[2:54:10] Sindragozer: you need to get a killing blow to get a copper coin. or someone in your group
[2:54:30] Sindragozer: or you get blood
[2:54:35] Sindragozer: and you conver them at the altar
[2:54:42] Sindragozer: 100 per silver coin
[2:54:43] Lausten: So whats up with the random phasing in retail lately? Anyone reported on this issue?
[2:55:18] Sindragozer: i think so
[2:55:47] onewing_dragon: flight path?
[2:55:48] bwoods79: did your green boe helm sell for 500g?

[2:56:50] SirRobHiFi: I'm surprised you don't use TradeSkillMaster
[2:57:41] bwoods79: Love it, you get dragon riding anywhere in retail then come to SoD and can't even fly
[2:57:43] SirRobHiFi: no scans needed
[2:57:44] Mordotzz: its also a heavy addon, i kinda only use it for the scanning desktop addon
[2:58:33] bwoods79: maybe they will do something crazy like unlock flying at 60 in sod
[2:58:41] Mordotzz: but i do prefer it over the other ah addon at least cus of it
[2:59:30] SirRobHiFi: Favourite feature of TSM is the one click mailing to empty your bags. Mail leather to one alt, boe's to another, cloth to another etc.
[2:59:38] Lausten: @bwoods79 Considering how we just saw the world being cut off when Dan went to the cave I doubt it
[2:59:48] bwoods79: i just want aoe loot

[3:01:27] Lausten: Good guy Streamer doesnt take gold from people

[3:02:36] nevermissedwow: oh cool thanks!!
[3:02:39] bwoods79: he is level 12 but could be an alt... maybe he has tons of gold on another toon
[3:03:14] Lausten: But taht is the classic experience, helping each other
[3:03:41] gioBBR: getting the rune maybe??
[3:03:42] Sindragozer: prob running to get to darkshore
[3:06:04] Sindragozer: i gotta get like 7 silver coins to get my trinket and cloak :/
[3:06:33] Sindragozer: it gets event specific gear
[3:06:42] Sindragozer: at the stv arena
[3:07:06] Sindragozer: no like new gear that you can only get from the event
[3:07:29] Doctorboster: is a slow attack speed pet better for melee weaving?
[3:07:35] Sindragozer: you can get arathi rep from it to by buying stranglethorn lumber and turning it in in arathi
[3:08:09] Sindragozer: i think its like 1 silver coin for 200 rep
[3:09:04] Sindragozer: not elite enough EZ Clap
[3:09:32] CrowMomocle: What a glorious tail on Luna!
[3:10:03] Sindragozer: no
[3:10:05] Sindragozer: talk to that
[3:10:07] Mordotzz: look on your portrait, u had pvp enabled already haha
[3:10:08] Sindragozer: you can rez at it
[3:10:14] Sindragozer: and youre invisible for 20 sec
[3:10:21] Sindragozer: to give you time to get away
[3:10:40] Sindragozer: and you dont give blood while u have that
[3:10:47] Sindragozer: but they cant see you anyway
[3:11:02] Sindragozer: ya its annoying without a group
[3:11:09] Sindragozer: people fight on the altars
[3:11:27] Sindragozer: so when you get blood it instantly converts to coins
[3:11:51] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:11:54] Sindragozer: ya the sky is cool
[3:12:34] Nobbel87: its really hard to get bloodstacks solo for some reason
[3:13:03] Nobbel87: a kill lands you blood stacks - blood stacks are dropped at altar. Its supposed to work on how gets killing blow
[3:13:14] Nobbel87: but you just killed someone and no blood so maybe %? no idea. On death you lose bit of your stack
[3:13:26] Sindragozer: you need to have someone in your party get a killing blow i think, thats why party is better
[3:13:34] Nobbel87: you do, 5 man
[3:13:34] Sindragozer: you lose 10 percent when you die i think
[3:13:54] Nobbel87: its honestly a fun event. Super dumb and head smashy, but fun
[3:14:22] Nobbel87: theres also a big loa dude in the zone, killing peops near him doubles blood stacks on kill but risk of him one shotting you
[3:14:44] Nobbel87: try general chat?

[3:16:26] Nobbel87: youre trying to grasp tacs. There are none lol
[3:16:50] Nobbel87: So the blood is stacked to 255. Killing blows earns them, you just not killing peops.
[3:17:03] Nobbel87: Tac is to make a group - res together - kill peops. Turn in around 100 to 200 stacks
[3:17:07] Nobbel87: correct
[3:17:13] Nobbel87: get killin

[3:18:12] Sindragozer: you just need to be in a group when it starts, and all be fighting on the altar

[3:19:17] Sindragozer: 1 per blood
[3:19:40] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:19:45] Sindragozer: 10 percent
[3:19:49] Sindragozer: ish
[3:19:58] Sindragozer: so if you had 200 youd lose 20 i think
[3:20:40] Sindragozer: ya as often as possible
[3:20:46] Sindragozer: yup
[3:21:37] fooxytv: this is so much fun..

[3:22:31] Lausten: Coordinated people with sweaty pvp people for sure :D
[3:22:45] Sindragozer: yup 󠀀
[3:22:54] keyboardturner: it worked on them for a second KEKW
[3:24:32] Sindragozer: you dont need to, you just fight on an altar you can get to within 20 sec of rezzing
[3:25:03] Sindragozer: ya cause you cant be attacked during that 20 sec window of rezzing
[3:25:29] Sindragozer: ya prob try a diff altar
[3:25:34] maplelost: thats hilarious
[3:26:21] Lausten: Was about to say, pve vs pvp
[3:26:51] Lausten: It is, its just the not so fun part of pvp, thus why so many people dont find it fin
[3:27:15] Lausten: Cause the people owning you are having a blast..

[3:29:42] Layliah79: just did my last attempt
[3:29:42] Sindragozer: ya thats why the strat is to fight on an altar. all your blood instantly converts
[3:30:42] Sindragozer: you get blood from killing mobs as well
[3:31:17] Sindragozer: its not that easy to do during this event
[3:31:41] Sindragozer: then youll just get farmed trying to get to an altar
[3:32:12] Lausten: Time to bring out the old flight hack Kappa
[3:32:15] Sindragozer: once its less packed i think mob farming will be worth
[3:33:02] Sindragozer: ya its prob 1
[3:33:13] Sindragozer: but i think its 1 per player as well, but im not sure
[3:33:46] Sindragozer: ya
[3:34:55] Sindragozer: i think you lose it
