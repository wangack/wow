[2:35:44] ShadoodHD: Turkey has landed, repeat, Turkey has landed

[2:36:05] SeargentHartman: whos the "big bad" in SL? the jailer& sylvannas? @Towelliee
[2:36:06] Reodoor: is prepatch out in US?
[2:36:06] ShackAttack009: i feel like we get a bad as arthas and moment Bolvar Moment
[2:36:06] hapsthehamster: because that is the way the turn around for sylvanas is she finds out that the jailor is not telling her all so she gets angry and aids us in killing him and she becomes the new jailor
[2:36:09] ShadoodHD: let's see if that command is still there
[2:36:12] ShadoodHD: !penis
[2:36:30] Tzarrus: She does have her own plan though, as well as the Jailer, so I could see where he may not have told her. That being said, she should know given their interactions as of late, as she ascends through his Covenant and attains more power.
[2:36:31] Xingxong: sry, what is that on the wall?
[2:36:34] hunterxp: palm tree
[2:36:55] MetallicusGaming: Xingxong palm tree
[2:37:01] Xingxong: oh

[2:37:02] madddrussian: how do you get the xp pots?
[2:37:21] ShadoodHD: It's not a penis it's a palm tree you baboon towRage
[2:37:38] redbulladin: Maybe getting sylvanas her revenge on arthas will stop her rage and maybe he wants her to be angry af
[2:37:45] LadyJasmin: or maybe arthas is her prize for helping the jailor
[2:37:51] ShackAttack009: anyone know the add he uses for his enemy bars/
[2:38:00] MetallicusGaming: Dwalin009 plater
[2:38:03] Xingxong: sry hes talking about quicks, my mind went south

[2:38:57] Tzarrus: speaking of Sylvanas, did they link her use of Valkyr from her jump in ICC to the plan she made with the Jailer? ...Haven't come across it in Alpha or Beta yet, but then again, I could have just missed it while testing.

[4:30:15] Crakila: Just bought GFuel using your code. Got a little bit stung on the shipping but oh well.....
[4:30:24] swampt1l: there was like 20 people in my grp first day of pre patch @Towelliee
[4:30:27] Artemisthemp: A few? It was like Legion Launch day and Not laying people was actually talking AKA being social
[4:30:29] Mopmopmopmop: would be fun if you could just kill the quest giver and then never get to your artefact weapon or your order hall
[4:30:32] dittademon: how do they expect people to get the "breaching the tomb" achivement since noone is going to play the raid
[4:30:33] Ghiswain: skipping draenor intro is not that smart though, so much exp from that short scenario
[4:30:41] Meshindale: jim bailed bro...too withered
[4:31:01] Fireahwk: @Crakila i had to order more just that the shipping was not more than the products
[4:31:04] Slitze: we're so used to amazon paying for our shipping. at least i am
[4:31:14] The_Yonaz: Yea, I ordered some to Sweden yesterday using Towelliee code. Speaking of, anyone wanna buy a first born? I'll thro in a free liver..
[4:31:24] nikola: @Skoobzx gear would probably be worse on off spec, which could be worse than wrong covenant?

[4:31:26] Moobot: Calm the spam, @ehweron (warning)
[4:31:58] ZyntosAran: @ehweron Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
[4:32:01] RunningOutOfRAM: may I ask you a question chat ? when SL hit you won't be able to fly in SL zones why do Tow update flying to max on alts that he will not play much outside SL zones ? I ask this since I'm in the same dilemma - Should I save gold from max flying to buy token or should I update the flying since characters that level to 50 get that gold anyways ?
[4:32:27] Fluisterwoud: what
[4:32:30] Crakila: @Fireahwk Yeah, I ordered a big tub, but $18 for shipping one tub is a big steep, but I suppose since it's shipping from the USA, I don't mind...
[4:32:41] PadidinJones: !battle
[4:32:41] Moobot: Play Stream Raiders with me at https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee LETS OWN THE BATTLEFIELD!

[4:32:52] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 404 units were placed on the battlefield.
[4:32:52] TweakT: imagine not upgrading to max flying on alts @runningoutofram
[4:32:54] FryeTV: Anybody have a Razer Naga trinity and fixed the left clikc double clicking? This is the 2nd naga trinity that has done this to me.
[4:32:59] jormosbanditos: Yeah, i was about to bought some gfuel first time but shipping here Finland would've paid same than one tub..
[4:33:07] swampt1l: 150% to 310 is a huge difference
[4:33:21] TweakT: i always farm the flying gold on the alt im playing
[4:33:24] gold9871: makes t he last 10 lvl go by fast :)
[4:33:29] Eng3llus: they did get rid of the 280 so its not as bad
[4:33:38] TweakT: 4.2k at exalted is not a big dent in my purse
[4:33:51] 11RYN: how long does it usually take you to get to 50?
[4:33:56] swampt1l: BM hunter
[4:34:05] warcraftnewsnetwork: Thanks to the pandemic my business is doing well enough for me to take launch week off. My friends are also joining me in a work out set up.

[5:06:33] BadXo: do subs get adds ? ( I don't see ads because nobody buys ads for my country (yet) ).
[5:06:34] CaladorDK: Ads are ok when the streamer initiates them. The problem is when you get random blocks of ads and miss some content due to it.
[5:06:38] JamesWaudby: I just had 3, so I don't really mind too much
[5:06:39] Veniem: 3 mins of adds for your entertainment is worth it though
[5:06:41] torx_7: @Towelliee Do you atleast get paid for those since they are making you do it?
[5:06:45] Tjorntved: those 6 or 7 ads is not gonna ruin your life to watch anyway
[5:06:46] jasperboy: Wait, isnt Prime blocking ads?

[5:07:02] IdiosyncraticRisk: I do agree with you towelliee in that regard, im not saying twitch is dead or anything stupid like that. i have absolutely no problem knowing that is how you make your money but im not watching 3 minutes of ads to just get into the fucking stream.
[5:07:02] tandagnisslan: I got no problem with you running ads, nor other streamers because you can time it when nothing exciting happens. Those midrolls though @Towelliee All I can do is vote with my money so no more subs and I'll donate through Paypal or something instead.
[5:07:07] idenkaz_: usally im a sub in this channel but i wanted to give my prime to a smaller streamer i enjoy
[5:07:09] Raskelot: @jameswaudby Twitch turbo does

[5:43:18] RedClassOne: Is Towelliee killing all bosses?
[5:43:29] JonnyScotland: mobile is more effecting the pc market/games, devs are making more money from mobile games than they are pc games, so they are going that route more.

[5:44:04] skaya86: I struggle to understand how people can play on such small displays to the point of calling it "gaming" (which sounds more hardcore than playing flappy bird casually)
[5:44:05] CeciliaWhite: Oh god you have the wings on

[5:44:24] 11RYN: I tried play RAID SL too, but I hate the fact that I don't have that much stamina and can't farm much, so I would have to pay. I never paid and will never pay in a mobile game
[5:44:24] Bogzeh: theres better gacha mobile games than raid, they just do a lot of marketing
[5:44:28] superleonidka: I dont like raid, but I have to admit it is very well made game

[5:47:01] JonnyScotland: Well it's not like they are losing money with the items if they give you them
[5:47:12] MrGattz: which is weird because its not like it costs them money for you to buy stuff in a game. it costs them nothing to produce fake pixels.

[5:48:56] HyperChief: @mrgattz that's why video game businesses are so profitable. You put forth the labor to produce it and maintain it and other than that it's like growing money on trees

[6:30:21] Roughneck124: What weapon enchant is that ?

[6:33:04] Calmoran_RS: jesus are ferals that bad? the healer is doing more dps
[6:33:17] ElPolloBatman: how does the feral manage to pull less damage than the healer?
[6:33:21] Kirioti: feral isnt bad
[6:33:24] NewWorldReign: didnt you have to move in certain places in the original fight?
[6:33:25] mo197: looks like Vegas at 4am

[6:33:56] sidoh_: if feral is high level and the healer is low, that results on weird scaling
[6:34:16] MrGattz: the rotation for feral is very long and the dps that it outputs isnt worth it compared to a BM hunter if you want to play feral to its max potential
[6:34:41] Kirioti: stuff doesnt stay alive long enough at low levels to let feral do the damage

[8:04:47] DrSkeletor: @Chronatog13 i only said 6 ADS is that complaining in your book as i didnt say shit or fuck or i hate these ads, I support ads as they generate renvenue and money for streamers.
