[0:18:11] stillsuitstk: someone said SOD?!
[0:22:02] ZagaTaga: we gettin old thatÂ´s the problem
[0:22:05] IAmSolari: probably just need practice and building back up muscle memory
[0:22:27] Eliannoula: we established last time scripes not old cause no grays :D
[0:22:41] sw0ngs: practice to get that muscle memory worked in
[0:22:59] Eliannoula: i was the same when i started seeing mine
[0:24:08] IAmSolari: have you considered going back to playing in the raid?
[0:25:32] IAmSolari: you were actually nuts
[0:26:14] ZagaTaga: meeres goated
[0:26:30] IAmSolari: Merees is so fucking good man I don't know how he manages
[0:26:32] ZagaTaga: his skill @all is impressiv
[0:26:38] Eliannoula: you never loose/forget the mentality and approach for world first or at least high octane gameplay cause its a transferable skill
[0:26:42] Hozzar1: @scripe did you read through thishttps://raider.io/news/610-mythic-raiding-and-progression-is-the-bar-too-high?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=inside_look&fbclid=IwAR3PgOybYn1GN9SFW538EgcvhF-eO-nJ5xtQcvVEz9lKHGZ-b1atoU5sBUc
[0:26:45] makkiiq: Hey! As a classic wotlk player logs is a big impact in the runs you get into to etc is't the same in retail? I've been trying to find some logs but everything is maybe private logging nowdays?
[0:26:48] Hozzar1: https://raider.io/news/610-mythic-raiding-and-progression-is-the-bar-too-high?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=inside_look&fbclid=IwAR3PgOybYn1GN9SFW538EgcvhF-eO-nJ5xtQcvVEz9lKHGZ-b1atoU5sBUc

[0:28:47] SyntiiTV: How you validate a guy if not via parses and basic talk? HE can be a decent human being, focused, but does 70+, would he be considered? :D
[0:28:56] makkiiq: That was one of the reason I was trying to check and also how each class and specc performed in the raids
[0:29:15] IAmSolari: you only really recruit from other top 50 guilds, so it would be understandable that to get into those guilds their parses would be good
[0:29:56] IAmSolari: this is a big boy key damn
[0:30:54] makkiiq: So let just say for context like me as a multi class average 99 parsing dps player in wotlk and low retail experience, how would you look at that in a recruit angle? If you get how I'm thinking
[0:31:03] makkiiq: If logs isn't that big off a deal in retail
[0:31:30] Eliannoula: ask maybe after the key, the question could get overlooked
[0:34:17] eatsleeprepeatx: @makkiiq not playing with nota atm? :D
[0:34:36] tiasen: do you always cast the meteor during combustion?
[0:34:50] tiasen: (im new to fire)
[0:36:24] makkiiq: @eatsleeprepeatx not anymore no :)
[0:36:25] Snowzii: yes tiasen
[0:39:05] AtunconChocolate: Is it still metal to use the head against the keyboard for dh rotation?

[0:43:52] progonitelj: yoo boss , why you aren't competing in mdi or tgp ?
[0:44:32] Eliannoula: lots of time and efford needed in that, which he can't bring cause busy
[0:44:35] projektremi: hi @Scripe  whati s a good dps class for s3 for raiding
[0:45:04] IAmSolari: @projektremi survival hunter
[0:45:15] projektremi: @IAmSolari are really survival hunter good ?
[0:45:54] IAmSolari: @projektremi no I'm joking, tbh just play what you find fun, there are a lot of viable classes rn
[0:46:10] projektremi: ok
[0:46:21] QlicTV: it's okey to play on tyra, since boss rp, u only loose 10s or so to pull boss
[0:47:05] IAmSolari: I wonder at what key level it would be impossible to kill yalnu on tyran week within the full EB timer
[0:48:12] EaglePete: oh, you dont run mass poly?
[0:48:28] tankeern: KEKW
[0:50:05] Breathe_EU: lamer :D

[0:55:15] makkiiq: Sent you a semi long question mid key (soz about that) so sending it again :)
[0:55:18] makkiiq: So let just say for example like me as a multi class average 99 parsing dps player in wotlk and low retail experience, how would you look at that in a recruit angle? If you get how I'm thinking if logs isn't that big of a deal in retail
[0:56:01] StephYEAHDAT: whats the name of the viewing season weakaura?
[0:56:20] hfcooky: Hello, want me to join for key ? I'm 3k6 DH tank, would love to key with you :D
[0:56:26] StephYEAHDAT: thanks!
[0:57:17] hfcooky: On my way! !
[0:58:11] bielich132: @makkiiq you cant say that good parses make you a good player. but good players actually never have bad parses
[0:58:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: f-friendships? monkaS
[0:58:45] Myusen: @bielich132 ah i mean thats debatable haha
[0:58:45] ImLathan: yo! got a raid question for Tindral, the WA for dispel order why is warlock 2nd and hunter 4th, feels counter intuitive having squishy class over tanks class waiting the longest for dispel? been a topic of discussion the last couple of days ðŸ˜‚
[0:59:08] makkiiq: Totally understand how you mean and think but it all kinda goes hand in hand in the end, if you dps the wrong things, dies to stupid things, you'll get bad parses but I get it sure
[1:00:09] starbux933: what do you think about the upcoming frost fire?
[1:00:24] ImLathan: thank you!
[1:00:46] hfcooky: You kicked me lmao

[1:31:48] domax92: it's just one of the most stupid things blizzard has ever done
[1:31:59] domax92: this legendary system
[1:32:34] cabita31: seeing Hellscream here reminds me how much i miss siege of ogrimmar, so much fun
[1:32:46] IAmSolari: @domax92 the drop is what it is, having a 10 hour questline after farming the thing for 3 months is a bit of a kick in the teeth
[1:33:01] IAmSolari: just let us use the axe
[1:33:07] domax92: i neab a lt of guilds are still progressing fyrakk now
[1:33:16] domax92: imagine not having the leggo how tilting that is
[1:33:35] domax92: a lot*
[1:33:38] cabdydragon: how should the legendary system then work?
[1:34:03] domax92: idk, not a complete gamble? lol
[1:34:10] domax92: like shadowmourne for example

[1:34:53] cabdydragon: same goes with my alt dk, some in my guild still have not gotten it
[1:34:53] ssplinx: looking like scripe taking gingiâ€™s spot next race :-D
[1:34:56] seacombe: seems very close
[1:34:57] Chimix1: no idea how long is last boss
[1:35:12] IAmSolari: just let me equip the axe I was farming for months
[1:35:22] Kuchta: last boss is like 5 min
[1:35:25] Trapsmaker: 5
[1:35:29] okostanths1: 6 is enough
[1:35:34] okostanths1: after 4 minutes u get gigabuff
[1:37:27] druggie12: @okostanths1 you mean the dragons come after 4min ?
[1:37:35] druggie12: i didnt know its 4min i was thinking its about %
[1:37:40] okostanths1: its not timer based but around there they come down
[1:37:48] okostanths1: its on a timer when u enter last phase
[1:38:13] Xerpytv: PauseChamp
[1:38:23] druggie12: a 1min 30 sec ad so satisficing on last boss
[1:38:53] druggie12: that make wanna subscribe

[1:44:45] hfcooky: What did you think of the route ? I play this in team but idk
[1:44:46] Tmyws: playing with mid warriors Chatting
[1:45:07] domax92: easly
[1:45:30] Tmyws: +29 on Tyr, I lined with my grp. Did 24mil to the boss
[1:45:47] adobegainz1: I don't know but i did a 24 on my warrior and i reflected 6 million damage on the third boss with spell reflection but i was lucky i got 3 casts on me lmao
[1:45:51] domax92: million reflect i think he means
[1:45:57] Tmyws: 24mil dmg
[1:46:07] Tmyws: from just reflect
[1:46:13] adobegainz1: that dot ticks like crazy

[2:43:56] lolkittinz: lock can dispel 3rd with imp with Destro and tongues all casters +cookie
[2:44:39] lolkittinz: I think this is one of the few keys you def want evoked tho, this and EB
[2:45:13] Exogenesis9: Warlocks are nice for some skips but most of the time it feels like spriest works better in the spot.
[2:45:59] hfcooky: I also need to time this lmao
[2:46:50] Exogenesis9: Throne's the main key I fear for the tank on some bosses. Second slams 'em.

[2:47:39] lolkittinz: anyways
[2:47:57] Exogenesis9: Totem is rough but flameshocks feel like the big threat on third.

[2:50:47] lolkittinz: @Exogenesis9 only thing spriest has going for it is fort in that key, lock is arguably better in every aspect tho (stops (blasphemy no DR with other stuns good for dogs and caster packs here) , shorter dispel and kick CD, curses, cookies, etc). fort is really huge at certain key levels for surviving 1 shots tho, just depends.
[2:51:25] lolkittinz: tank will take less dmg with lock in group if lock is ethical
[2:52:25] lolkittinz: also really tanky in that key there is no rot bosses

[4:27:46] mohaso21: it was with you
[4:28:04] tvilk: If you pop meta you can usually survive the 30-40 range easily, so i imagine you can go even higher with the right defensive usage

[4:33:47] mohaso21: i didnt like anything about the priest one
[4:33:51] tvilk: KEKW
[4:34:05] tvilk: no one liked the priest one
[4:34:12] Dexzz: they have to satisfy theory crafters alittle bit I guess
[4:34:15] tvilk: Casuals say it's too complicated and tryhards say it's useless
[4:34:43] mohaso21: from the tooltip and all it sounds very meh right now yeah
