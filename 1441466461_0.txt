[0:31:59] rewarka: ok care :)
[0:32:02] dark___jester: I think you should come on your stream while wearing a Lich King helmet
[0:32:29] garzist: fake laugh
[0:32:51] 7thSaga: ResedentSlepper
[0:33:15] AlinCodee: The Lich King concept got erased from the story in this expansion. That's why they destroyed the Helm of Domination and remade it into Helm of Wills
[0:33:24] 7thSaga: SORRY SWIFTY I SAY UCK classic im ino this now
