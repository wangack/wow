[0:00:37] Badasti: well the main thing to unplug is power when using pressurised air, condensation from the can create a short if you spray it too close
[0:00:59] Badasti: but he probably took the PC outside or something, i would never blow my pc out indoors XD
[0:01:08] pr0x365: I swear this stream makes my day when I'm off from work with some coffee :D
[0:01:26] Badasti: wb

[0:02:35] Badasti: after 7 eyars that keyboard has to be a biohazard by now
[0:02:45] heymomimonttv: just a hassle to get all the keycaps off
[0:02:51] Luigicamp: I am so lazy when it comes to kb. Believe it or not, I often get a new one instead lol
[0:02:54] storm_chaser_ron: he's done it!

[0:04:52] j0j0j0j0j0j0: xd
[0:04:56] StromicusRex: @j0j0j0j0j0j0 can you ask another innocent harmless question that sparks angry debates and name calling again?
[0:05:02] heymomimonttv: kekw

[0:05:46] pr0x365: xD I'm from LA
[0:05:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's an election year, it's going to get worse
[0:06:03] zerx_gg: move to europe
[0:06:04] Badasti: thats all over these days unfortunately... the days of people holding their own beliefs are long gone
[0:06:06] zerx_gg: chad move
[0:06:10] StromicusRex: idk if i'm gonna survive past november
[0:06:17] Badasti: these days you gotta sign up to your preferred ideological club LUL
[0:06:20] heymomimonttv: the people who get real pressed over any mention of stupid shit like that are the ones who dont realize it's two hands on the same piece of shit body. neither party truly cares haha
[0:06:34] wire_ghost: really wish i had a million channel points yesterday. it was a perfect time for emote only
[0:06:42] Aimed57: good morning ven
[0:06:42] Luigicamp: yeah I am ready to take off if shit hits the fan. I told my dad. Get ready, Switzerland here I come.

[0:06:54] StromicusRex: take me with you pls @Luigicamp
[0:06:56] heymomimonttv: bangers only today
[0:06:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: I personally just try to stay out of any politics or religion talk, someone always gets upset
[0:07:08] zachgamegodx: music kinda loud eh
[0:07:08] storm_chaser_ron: switzerland is gorgeous
[0:07:13] zerx_gg: could move to Luxembourg or Monaco instead of switzerland
[0:07:13] StromicusRex: i would give anything to be cold right now ugh
[0:07:17] Badasti: @wEiRdO_dUdE politics is the new religion
[0:07:17] heymomimonttv: @wEiRdO_dUdE fr, wow streamer twitch chat is not the place for those discussions
[0:07:18] StromicusRex: i'm so sick of it being spring already
[0:07:19] storm_chaser_ron: music volume seems fine to me
[0:07:19] j0j0j0j0j0j0: i just got my italian citizenship. we can split an appt luigi
[0:07:23] StromicusRex: its FINE
[0:07:28] StromicusRex: i can actually hear it for once
[0:07:29] StromicusRex: noooo
[0:07:37] skez_live: How do you feel about casted MW Monk vs Hpal in solo shuffle right now?
[0:07:43] zerx_gg: turn music up and streamer down
[0:07:45] zerx_gg: KKona
[0:08:09] j0j0j0j0j0j0: yea my family is from there. it took forever to apply but it finally happened lol
[0:08:09] doclovejr: did I miss the tier list??
[0:08:23] clickermekk: when i was a kid i wanted the new disturbed album and This gorillaz album was in the Disturbed section and i thought it was them. now im a gorrilaz fan by accident
[0:08:30] Badasti: its annoying atm, id rather dh was as broken as ret in s1
[0:08:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even Snupy is on demon hunter today DxCat
[0:08:38] Badasti: that way blizzard would likely do something about it isntead of this slow burn
[0:08:42] Luigicamp: @j0j0j0j0j0j0 No apt. I have a house in Switzerland. It's not Italy, but you'd be 1.5h from Milan.
[0:08:46] Aimed57: most fun dps class to alt?
[0:08:46] doclovejr: great, I need guidance. i want that S4 glad mount so badddddd
[0:09:01] Dwilk20: Dwilk20 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Morning Ven
[0:09:14] wackpoetic: I wish there was Rated BG Blitz so at least perception of the Meta wasn't entirely based on Solo Shuffle/AWC
[0:09:15] Dwilk20: Farming the Lego Axe quests out
[0:09:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: I definitely wanna see the tier list
[0:09:23] NJMcChillan: and here i am thinking about making another healer instead of DH
[0:09:24] wackpoetic: also I really want to play Rated BG Blitz
[0:09:25] heymomimonttv: @clickermekk tbh that worked out better for you lol
[0:09:28] NJMcChillan: but i mean, resto druid is also broken lol
[0:09:36] j0j0j0j0j0j0: @Luigicamp oh nice! that's awesome. i think i'd want to live in that region if i did end up moving there (northern italy bordering switzerland)
[0:09:37] heymomimonttv: @wackpoetic bg blitz is 'rated' :D
[0:09:43] gregl__: rhsam is better @NJMcChillan
[0:09:54] clickermekk: @heymomimonttv honestly it really did lol
[0:09:57] figurines: big naruto fan?
[0:10:43] figurines: *gasp*
[0:10:51] storm_chaser_ron: why do you say it like that
[0:10:52] figurines: narto is great
[0:10:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa
[0:10:55] storm_chaser_ron: is that how its pronounced?
[0:10:57] heymomimonttv: believe it! (y)
[0:10:59] wackpoetic: Bro... you didn't even watch Rock Lee vs Gaara?
[0:11:02] figurines: you need to get on that right away
[0:11:08] Luigicamp: @j0j0j0j0j0j0 yeah it's a nice region
[0:11:18] marvin1995xo: watch it now haha
[0:11:21] wackpoetic: Rock Lee vs Gaara easily top 5 anime fights
[0:11:25] doclovejr: idea for a new tier list, what classes with current tunning will be solid with their community chosen tier set next season
[0:11:46] figurines: no it really isn't a top 5 anime fight. naruto is cute and def. worth watching tho
[0:11:52] Badasti: not a huge anime / manga fan but the Berserk manga was so damn good
[0:11:58] mikepoggers_: if you do, ill buy
[0:11:59] StromicusRex: do i get deals if i already subbed the last time
[0:12:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard that destro warlocks picked the wrong tier set for next season, they could get wrecked
[0:12:10] zerx_gg: its probably only for new customers StromicusRex
[0:12:12] zerx_gg: scumbags
[0:12:15] StromicusRex: scumbags
[0:12:16] j0j0j0j0j0j0: @StromicusRex new email / cc 8^)
[0:12:18] wackpoetic: figurines name 5 better fight scenes than Rock Lee vs Gaara RIGHT NOW Madge
[0:12:21] StromicusRex: tru
[0:12:23] skez_live: nice :D  does the sponsorship work with Greenchef as well?
[0:12:24] derangedhippo: Is Naruto that weird headband sign language show where they fight as morphed gorillas?
[0:12:36] StromicusRex: i am moving soon so new address works too
[0:12:53] MaximumnNeo: i did that for a while, it just became more of a pain than its worth
[0:12:53] storm_chaser_ron: no
[0:12:57] j0j0j0j0j0j0: i do that. i havent paid for flights for years
[0:12:58] pr0x365: Card churning
[0:12:59] Badasti: i swore off credit cards about 7 years ago..
[0:12:59] heymomimonttv: @derangedhippo yes, yes, no
[0:13:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: We got cupid cleave!
[0:13:12] mikepoggers_: yup, i put everything on a CC and pay it off at end of month, u end up making money even if its 1% cash back
[0:13:13] gregl__: same
[0:13:14] wackpoetic: there are sites that track the different deals/offers, but I think the cost/benefit would be too much for me
[0:13:15] MaximumnNeo: especially because the credit cards dont always close on your credit report and you have to constantly call them to get it closed
[0:13:15] Mcaveryst: i got a 5% cash back bank of america thats all i use and i have 5 others
[0:13:16] seyvyur: its not good for your credit to be opening and canceling cards
[0:13:18] gregl__: I treat it as a debit
[0:13:20] heymomimonttv: isnt cupid cleave surv + ret?
[0:13:21] skez_live: thats the best way
[0:13:26] Badasti: its good to build credit history, just out of principle i hate them
[0:13:29] wackpoetic: my current card is about to expire and I think it had like a 5 year expiration when I first got it LuL
[0:13:31] heymomimonttv: ranged hunter + ret is normal cupid?
[0:13:46] j0j0j0j0j0j0: @seyvyur ive opened over 10 cc's and am consistently hovering around 800
[0:14:08] seyvyur: if you cancel them it will hurt your credit
[0:14:29] j0j0j0j0j0j0: no canceling them does not hurt your credit. the hard inquiry when opening them does (slightly)
[0:14:35] StromicusRex: as long as you're paying on top consistently and always have something with a balance, you're good
[0:14:43] StromicusRex: on time*
[0:14:50] skez_live: @j0j0j0j0j0j0 closing a credit card lowers your total available credit balance, which does hurt your credit score
[0:14:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP hpal, ouch
[0:14:58] MaximumnNeo: numerous credit checks does in fact hurt your credit. Its stupid but real
[0:15:02] Luigicamp: does Canada have the same credit system like in the US? Like we don't have it in Switzerland for instance. People don't run your credit score for big purchases or rent for instance.
[0:15:38] Luigicamp: in Switzerland they don't, in the US they do
[0:15:43] NJMcChillan: canada does have one like the US yeah
[0:15:48] Luigicamp: ok
[0:15:51] StromicusRex: they run your credit score for fucking everything in the US
[0:15:56] MaximumnNeo: I can tell you for a fact, that every major bank in Canada runs your credit for opening up any of their cards. Might not be true for things like Capital one.
[0:15:57] heymomimonttv: literally everything
[0:15:57] Luigicamp: yep
[0:16:09] numero5218: not sure what states this guys living in lol
[0:16:13] heymomimonttv: its so fucking dumb. they run your credit for things that won't affect your credit, which i think is illegal
[0:16:24] heymomimonttv: should be illegal*
[0:16:24] j0j0j0j0j0j0: @skez_live i guess i've held 2 cards that have very high limits so the secondary cards seem to have no impact
[0:16:33] skez_live: @j0j0j0j0j0j0 very possible
[0:16:56] skez_live: @MaximumnNeo yeah the only cards you dont need a hard score check would be like student visa cards with VERY low balances
[0:17:22] MaximumnNeo: even those they check your credit, its just that you have no credit and they give that a pass for those cards
[0:17:58] doclovejr: classic DH, train the healer
[0:18:23] skez_live: yes and i hate it..... as a healer main lol
[0:18:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the healer often seems like the best target
[0:18:41] baxter5569: blenderball vs rsham its easy win every time
[0:18:42] BMaStream: Every time a DH looks at me I lose at least 50% of my hp as a healer
[0:18:45] Badasti: good, good
[0:18:47] j0j0j0j0j0j0: credit score is not even that important as long as it is above 700. it only really matters if you're trying to get approved for a large purchase (car loan, mortgage, etc)
[0:18:56] sullybrew: @heymomimonttv points lost from credit checks come back in like 90 days or something
[0:19:15] sullybrew: you use points for over applying basically
[0:19:20] bransby09: Depends if its a hard or soft credit check
[0:19:27] heymomimonttv: @sullybrew yea that doesnt bother me as much. checking my credit to rent an apartment when my rent isnt going to affect my credit is where i have an issue
[0:19:38] sullybrew: like if you just tried to apply to a card every few months and accepted or not there would be a running lost balance from recent checks
[0:19:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Hard checks" stay on your credit report for like 2 years
[0:19:44] n0bodygood: its to prevent you taking out giga loans/rentals etc at one time
[0:20:02] n0bodygood: every time someone checks your score it dips so if you do a ton in like one month youd be less likely to be approved further
[0:20:06] n0bodygood: afaik
[0:20:07] baxter5569: here is soft and hard credit checks. it just means you are looking at doing something with your credit and its dumb. you can check your own credit for free with no impact any time
[0:20:09] bransby09: Yea but the hit to your credit last like 4-6 months then its back but you have to avoid multiple hard checks within a certain timeframe
[0:20:11] MaximumnNeo: The idea is that if people have multiple credit checks, they are "Credit surfing" meaning they could be trying to get way more credit than they can afford by doing it  simultaneously at multiple places. At least thats the idea. In reality its just as silly rule banks follow.
[0:20:23] MaximumnNeo: in Canada you really can have more than 4 every 120 days
[0:20:28] sullybrew: ya its to keep you from going apeshit spending and bankrupting as far as i can tell its more annoying than anything else and usually doesnt affect much cause you would avoid doing it before big purchases
[0:20:30] MaximumnNeo: without losing score
[0:20:41] Reiumi_: D:
[0:20:45] Reiumi_: KEKW
[0:20:48] Badasti: lmao
[0:20:51] urack: Hello <3
[0:20:53] Badasti: this is how every DH thinks
[0:21:09] skez_live: DH Healer spec when?? need to have a group of all DHs
[0:21:34] j0j0j0j0j0j0: if they FOTM rerolled DH years ago and DH just stayed strong, does it still count as a reroll?
[0:21:36] sullybrew: @heymomimonttv my credit is good enough they dont check my rental references, like i had no rental history and they were like ya sure no worries cause of it. so it actually helped that time
[0:21:52] HydroSplat: i was just healing a lobby at 1950 in solo where a dh wouldn't use his defensives and line me. he told me to keep up and solo is for fun so he doesn't care. then he went 0-6 lol
[0:22:10] hivenzino: I don't even know if we have a credit score system in Belgium
[0:22:12] sullybrew: @sullybrew but i hear you its weird and has nothing to do with cash flow required for rent
[0:22:29] Badasti: @j0j0j0j0j0j0 I personally maintain the position that the class ahs been gross since its inception and should never have been added to the game LUL
[0:22:40] Badasti: even though i play it now when i just want to vibe and stop stressing
[0:22:57] nouneyo: what are your top 3 class/specs you play and like the most
[0:23:02] urack: Hello <3
[0:23:10] BMaStream: Yo Ven did you ever watch Kids in he Hall?
[0:23:10] Reiumi_: Chatting
[0:23:16] jukeandnuke: picking up new strat for SS - kill the healer!
[0:23:22] driftwood_tc: you gotta try ToD on scroll wheel
[0:23:28] Aroty: Soo good to see druid get trained down
[0:23:34] heymomimonttv: @sullybrew i have great rental references, but little credit history until recently. it's affected me unfortunately so now im focusing on building credit
[0:23:42] likeewlock: or just train the lock
[0:24:00] skez_live: the best is DH, DK, Fistweaver, just a big fucking clump of cleave dmg and healing
[0:24:06] sawyershabel: Arena right now kind of feels like you're just waiting for dampening and praying that your healer doesn't die or let someone else die
[0:24:12] sawyershabel: Such a weird meta
[0:25:18] SweatyDaniels: healers in shuffle only want one thing and its disgusting (pain)
[0:25:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rdruid is hanging tough
[0:25:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Got 'em!
[0:25:50] driftwood_tc: when people ask why healers are so rare in SS show them a clip from last 2 games LUL
[0:26:04] sullybrew: @heymomimonttv ahhh, cuts both ways i guess. r/personalfinance can be really useful for general tips and tricks
[0:26:34] primejusticegaming: yooo what up ven
[0:26:34] marvin1995xo: trueee rogues too
[0:26:35] popzirl: No peels meta
[0:26:37] wackpoetic: Also you can't let an Rdruid freecast clones so it's easier to train them
[0:26:46] driftwood_tc: I thought DH was pure skill based.. Im shocked.
[0:26:50] primejusticegaming: chillen
[0:26:52] asenku11k: off to work, glad u got ur cam workn, c ya l8r
[0:26:59] seyvyur: a lot healers have swapped to ~20% vers too - makes them killable
[0:26:59] sawyershabel: PvE Meta
[0:27:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the demon hunter is effectively a tank, and that's the strat against tank specs. CC them and kite them, etc
[0:27:23] anmusallam: good morning venman
[0:27:48] anmusallam: new haircut?
[0:27:58] StromicusRex: lol
[0:28:27] figurines: @anmusallam its a toupe
[0:28:38] marvin1995xo: tank/dps spes
[0:28:38] skez_live: im going back to max verse
[0:28:40] odikwow: How do I craft a pvp item and use my Verdant trophy of comquest How do I gear for arena in the fastest way?
[0:28:55] sawyershabel: I haven't played overwatch since 2017 lol
[0:28:59] seyvyur: need the mastery to last into dampening
[0:29:00] cruelhabbitts: how’s the new rank system ? @venruki
[0:29:02] DegStaerian: havent played enough to say if its better then before
[0:29:21] numero5218: The new ranking system better in overwatch

[0:30:07] fatlittlepaypig: I played hpal at 2200 last night for an hour after a two month break and unsubbed lol DH legit ruining the game and every lobby had 4 melee
[0:30:11] StromicusRex: if they didnt wanna be called trash they shouldn't have trash in their name Susge
[0:30:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was watching Nahj on demon hunter and he was saying since he didn't play the season before on it, the first 10 or so matches were just kind of lousy as he blew through it
[0:30:20] cruelhabbitts: ow is fun
[0:30:25] obviouslytai: KEKW
[0:30:28] caspian1993: XD
[0:30:35] wackpoetic: OW is fun, but the grind to unlock new heroes is very dissuasive to new players
[0:30:38] Reiumi_: Pog DH
[0:30:39] man0litos: Heres the true question Ven
[0:30:45] pr0x365: Ven, did you build your own PC? If so, how much did you put into it?
[0:30:45] trashukkonen: trash is all good
[0:30:49] sawyershabel: Its a lot
[0:30:49] wackpoetic: especially since all of the new heroes in OW are OP on release
[0:30:50] man0litos: What do you prefer, rogue meta or DH ? @venruki
[0:30:51] Badasti: ow 2 just killed it for me
[0:30:51] seyvyur: at 2200 you usually see casters, its 1600-2000 that is all melee
[0:30:58] driftwood_tc: oh boi LUL
[0:31:04] Datguyjay: the way it should be
[0:31:08] Kujo_XX: Look at the melee lines in general

[0:32:45] Badasti: @soddi i personally dont think MS effects belong in the game anymore, and classes that have them certainly have no business at the top of the damage meters
[0:33:05] figurines: @Badasti 100% agree. MS makes the game harder for our incompetent dev team.

[1:21:50] DoYouSeeOk: what sword is that ?
[1:21:50] beastboyy122: lol he’s outta touch then
[1:21:51] style5z: I honestly don't hate that, forcing tar123 and focus
[1:21:52] chaps_86: cant imagine not playing with arena 1,2,3, binds
[1:21:52] Hammer90x: i mean, would add a lot more skill to the spamable cc's
[1:22:10] Meadamemnon: purge and purge focus
[1:22:11] Badasti: got an mmo mouse baby
[1:22:29] Badasti: hex pyurge flame shock and shear on arena1-3
[1:22:35] soddi: need an mmo mouse with 12 buttons on both sides xD
[1:22:39] whittyxo: i think this lobby sucks ass for ww xd
[1:22:41] chaps_86: that seems kind of rough
[1:23:07] serratedlove: o7 dead mage
[1:23:50] kand1nsky: that is the reason nobody likes mages Kappa
[1:23:53] Badasti: @soddi just 12 is fine, like if i press the button it purges arena1, if i press shift then the button then it flame shocks arena1
[1:23:53] soddi: nvm
[1:23:56] serratedlove: jk people don't react

[1:24:43] enviscerate: dh has his brain on power saving mode PoroSad
[1:24:44] nikthevoker: gaslighting healers LUL
[1:25:02] Spaceberry_McDuck: got the zoo on you
[1:25:07] Badasti: @soddi aye, super useful when you get used to it :)
[1:25:43] soddi: kinda makes sense for those high cd purge, stun, flameshock buttons
[1:26:20] soddi: but my macros slots are already  all used rukiCry
[1:27:17] Badasti: same, its so annoying when you play a lot of classes
[1:27:36] nikthevoker: he was stunned he couldnt get him! LUL

[1:27:54] willie_stroker_99: No
[1:27:54] Garthd: not enough
[1:28:02] style5z: he just missed essence break
[1:28:04] Reythewrecker: lean into it
[1:28:08] Hobblefoot: Yall are sickos
[1:28:09] obe1kanobe1989: how he feel
[1:28:11] whittyxo: LMAO
[1:28:21] Datguyjay: you're hurting my feelings ven (I've been playing dh since legion and want them nerfed too)
[1:28:30] trobled: dhs should be bullied into rerolling a more respectable class. like outlaw rogue Kappa
[1:28:41] firemonkey170: life is hard as a mage
[1:28:44] Hobblefoot: DH does not need a nerf. They keep losing here.
[1:28:47] Reythewrecker: dark vendon
[1:28:52] chaps_86: @Hobblefoot lol
[1:28:54] wicked_wizurd: compliment his mog

[1:29:02] whittyxo: LOL
[1:29:05] Hobblefoot: @chaps_86 Not Proof?  :P
[1:29:09] soddi: @chaps_86 I like seeing the buttons that I press in the bars though :/ bindpad feels so abstract
[1:29:17] Garthd: if activists arn't protesting you, you're not toxic enough
[1:29:34] whittyxo: ^ hes got a point
[1:29:50] Reuhn: why is there 10 pets
[1:29:51] chaps_86: @soddi I just meant for more macro space. if you have kick on your bar, you really dont need to see the macro for focus, arena 1,2,3,.
[1:30:06] whittyxo: bm hunters are actually zookeepers
[1:30:21] Salanzo: havent played in several weeks should i just run DH/destro/rsham and get right back to status quo or
[1:30:39] Badasti: DH anything is the right answer
[1:30:44] chaps_86: @Salanzo easiest
[1:30:46] popzirl: Nothing wrong with that
[1:30:46] driftwood_tc: people talking about DH's being dumb, but wtf is going on with the pet builds with a million pets out
[1:31:01] danger_daft: nooo don't tell more people to play DH

[1:32:39] Badasti: that hunty bro saved that turtle for the very last second
[1:32:40] soddi: secretly plays osu in off time maybe

[1:33:16] tcyronek0: hey ven any tips for ret/dh/x matchup as phdk(I’m hpriest)?  keep fighting this team around 2.4 and it’s miserable
[1:33:18] Badasti: well
[1:33:22] Badasti: the shaman purges the mage
[1:33:26] Badasti: and statics his ass
[1:33:32] Badasti: and you guys grind him to pulp
[1:34:00] firemonkey170: @thisisthotcaller Look up Teea Nameplate Totems Weakaura
[1:34:48] soddi: unlucky
[1:34:48] Moobot: Latest video "Demon Hunters are impossible to kill" view it here: youtu.be/lX4aJQJ5oiY
[1:34:48] Badasti: LUL
[1:34:52] Schwenkyytv: its interesting that rogues could be just as good as DH's but you wont see them being played in every single match
[1:34:52] Sindorii: what talent did u drop to get dispell as a WW? @venruki
[1:34:59] obe1kanobe1989: :D:D:D:D mage sad

[1:36:10] tcyronek0: fair point thanks brotha
[1:36:18] NewDee: what website did you reference in the short YT you did today? (the spec performance)
[1:36:38] Schwenkyytv: @serratedlove you see the top 1% with rogues but the rest there isnt because DH is so much easier to play
[1:36:48] NewDee: thanks
[1:36:52] tcyronek0: i legit fought nothing but DH comp variants yesterday trying for glad wins
[1:37:00] serratedlove: @Schwenkyytv exactly, but rogue haters say otherwise LuL
[1:37:10] tcyronek0: that was the worst tho
[1:37:54] percentagesx: I really miss when you could control flying serpent kick 😢
[1:37:59] baxter5569: probably between queues?
[1:38:00] soddi: do you loose by mana, damp or oneshot?
[1:38:01] Badasti: prob tired of queuing into fistweavers and dh's
[1:38:09] ATHLTE: good morning shadow of the wind
[1:38:17] heymomimonttv: even roxxy on classic what the heck
[1:38:33] heymomimonttv: no you're not
[1:38:33] baxter5569: sigh :(
[1:38:34] storm_chaser_ron: :(
[1:38:36] heymomimonttv: dont say that <l3
[1:38:38] chaps_86: i just threw up
[1:38:42] dipicat: def a bit of a dull point in the season. hopefully its just another 4-6 weeks before they announce end and things get fired up tho
[1:38:42] cantfindthebox: you wont play disc
[1:38:42] chaps_86: =P
[1:38:46] Salanzo: saying something when leveling and questing is more fun than doing arena at this point :(
[1:38:48] heymomimonttv: <3
[1:38:58] cantfindthebox: cant too busy playing disc bro
[1:38:58] skez_live: ty ven lol
[1:39:01] cantfindthebox: lets have a discoff
[1:39:10] ByeAndai: disc is more fun than holy and I stand by that forever
[1:39:15] happyheals: I keep logging in to level in sod and I just get so bored at how slow it is and get back on retail
[1:39:24] cantfindthebox: i';ll use my shadow,kick, grapple
[1:39:26] soddi: for retail and arena being supposedly dead, I was kinda impressed by the 15k awc viewcount
[1:39:34] heymomimonttv: @happyheals same. i can get like 30-45 minutes into SOD and then log right back onto retail
[1:39:44] happyheals: they had views on 2 platforms as well
[1:39:49] skez_live: i cant play sod for long at all..like MAYBE complete 2 quests
[1:40:17] happyheals: I was falling asleep in my 4th stockades run on my druid at level 26
[1:40:17] ericpowerful: Are you excited for new xpac? I haven't seen much about it
[1:40:27] cantfindthebox: i didn't even know awc was coming up, poorly advertised
[1:40:33] cantfindthebox: i've been pvping since bc
[1:41:05] Tiebot87: how come sewers is NEVER in shuffle? @venruki
[1:41:11] happyheals: lol at 37 minutes in solo shuffle q and avg wait time is 13 mins
[1:41:24] soddi: peel him like a banana and shove it up his
[1:41:25] heymomimonttv: instead of putting DH in every lobby, they should instead make DH only lobbies and let the rest of us play without them :)
[1:41:28] style5z: ven has anyone ever asked you to turn off your friends coming on/off blizz notification soudn?
[1:41:28] chaps_86: robodrome would be cool
[1:41:34] SweatyDaniels: wait is it rotation or did they remove blade's edge?
[1:41:36] whittyxo: justice for hook point
[1:41:36] Sindorii: keep edge out
[1:41:36] chaps_86: i like that map
[1:41:40] heymomimonttv: @SweatyDaniels removed for now
[1:42:06] ericpowerful: mythic shuffle - every game played on classic ring of valor
[1:42:08] SweatyDaniels: if they did a 5v5 blade's edge brawl that would be kinda fun
[1:42:24] SweatyDaniels: but make it so you can q as a premade
[1:42:35] heymomimonttv: 5v5 would be fun, blades edge tho is bugged currently which is why it's out
[1:42:53] SweatyDaniels: @heymomimonttv good riddance i say
[1:43:01] rohrzk: microsoft business update livestream is in 15 min
[1:43:07] serratedlove: @heymomimonttv 5v5 would be triple dh on each team SMOrc
[1:43:18] soddi: 5v5 gives me 5 moonkin ptsd
[1:43:35] heymomimonttv: @serratedlove this goes back to my idea of letting all the DH queue against each other and letting non DH play with each other
[1:43:48] serratedlove: I agree
[1:44:24] heymomimonttv: kinda crazy that demo did more dmg than dh there
[1:44:36] style5z: check scoreboard thoi
[1:44:40] style5z: probably pets
[1:45:08] heymomimonttv: do demo pets cleave?
[1:45:13] serratedlove: pvp would be great if they nerfed dh damage, devo damage, and outlaw cdr
[1:45:16] heymomimonttv: that i was unaware of, besides tyrant
[1:45:32] heymomimonttv: @serratedlove yea, or make dev have to press something other than devastation repeatedly
[1:45:37] style5z: devo isn't really being oppressive though
[1:45:56] style5z: or maybe it's just cause the andy's only play OP melees
[1:46:01] heymomimonttv: devastation spam is oppressive into melee. they spam so much its almost a permanent slow
[1:46:16] heymomimonttv: disintegrate i mean*
[1:46:25] style5z: yea
[1:46:28] style5z: just less represented is all I mean
[1:47:24] danieljjohnsonn: whose probably best Demo lock Ven? looking for someone to steal talents/watch to learn it! XD
[1:48:23] thunderxmvp: Darkwingduck (Swapxy), Chanimals, Merce from the EU are probably the best
[1:48:30] gdodmebxu: no swap FeelsBadMan
[1:48:38] famous1939: no dome, no swap, still had a pain supp
[1:48:42] danieljjohnsonn: ty
[1:48:59] konglarsen: watching 3x 30sec commercials gotta make me the biggest supporter here
[1:49:02] heymomimonttv: @danieljjohnsonn bualock, maldiva, jazggz
[1:49:13] What_ln_Tarnation: LUL
[1:49:24] What_ln_Tarnation: double pain supp at start EZ
[1:49:34] style5z: just go to drustvar 3v3 and filter by demo lock and check top 3-5 specs
[1:49:38] famous1939: priest is tilted
[1:49:43] ncro1337: report
[1:49:43] thunderxmvp: @heymomimonttv Jazz is only insane on destro, bualock is not a consistent r1, Maldiva cant be argued with he is insane
[1:49:48] twitch_pmk: win trading?
[1:49:57] driftwood_tc: priest running it down mid?
[1:50:00] Reythewrecker: he become rukiMad
[1:50:33] chaps_86: @thunderxmvp jazz recently got #1 on aff shuffle, not sure what you mean "only destro"
[1:50:37] What_ln_Tarnation: Madge
[1:50:37] heymomimonttv: @thunderxmvp jaz hit r1 aff recently, but yea idk if i've seen him push demo. bualock has decent info to learn. maldiva is all around best lock imo from what i've watched of lock players. dude just knows that class inside and out
[1:51:19] konglarsen: PLUS Mike can rent your a Tesla for a decent price Kappa
[1:51:24] heymomimonttv: lmfao
[1:51:47] thunderxmvp: @heymomimonttv Maldiva has quite a few AWC wins to catch up to Chani, don't think anyone can argue that he is the most consistent top lock in the world
[1:52:01] What_ln_Tarnation: who remembers when monks were highest mobility class in the game?
[1:52:12] BanthaBantha: theres alot of great locks
[1:52:28] ryanblue98: does chan even s tream retail ever ?
[1:52:43] style5z: not often, he's a retail andy
[1:52:46] style5z: classic*
[1:52:49] heymomimonttv: @thunderxmvp maldiva isn't allowed to compete so that's not gonna happen
[1:52:55] thunderxmvp: Yes, when whaazz forces him to practice, but thats like once in a blue moon hehe
[1:53:12] What_ln_Tarnation: can someone explain how if dark pact costs 20% of lock's hp why they never lose hp when they press it?
[1:53:18] driftwood_tc: NOPERS need BM and Demo buff
[1:53:24] style5z: @What_ln_Tarnation there's a talent that makes it 5%
[1:53:26] waelrick: LUL  󠀀
[1:53:30] Spaceberry_McDuck: when the pet classes are good, pvp feels worse
[1:53:31] What_ln_Tarnation: o
[1:53:36] kesharq: Not sure, i'll tell you once iv finished counting them all :P
[1:53:42] Tpyoeror: i like bm hunter but the pet arena insanity is ridiculous
[1:53:46] sapzrogue: blizz REALLY need to reduce the pets. NOBODY likes that screen clutter
[1:53:49] heymomimonttv: @Spaceberry_McDuck yea cuz it makes you feel like you're fighting an entire army
[1:53:52] TheAgonistxX: fulfilling that class fantasy
[1:54:08] chaps_86: wut just happneed
[1:54:14] What_ln_Tarnation: so many achieves
[1:54:29] ryanblue98: You ever try ELE Ven?
[1:54:30] chaps_86: dh died?
[1:54:53] twitch_pmk: Damn DH death just went up by 0.0000001%
[1:54:56] twitch_pmk: lol
[1:55:00] rembrandt89: bm hunter is so boring
[1:55:10] thunderxmvp: As in chani is the top lock
[1:55:19] chaps_86: @ryanblue98 his Procpooper is one of legend =D
[1:55:19] Reythewrecker: but snutz
[1:55:35] ryanblue98: @chaps_86 only seen him heal on it

[1:56:57] style5z: nick is dukama
[1:56:58] style5z: the goat
[1:57:09] happyheals: Snutz is a pretty good lock too right?
[1:57:16] heymomimonttv: say what you want about maldiva as a person, but how is he not a top lock?
[1:57:17] varok87: Shards Best Warlock
[1:57:19] Roxxybolts: there are alot more gooood locks
[1:57:25] Roxxybolts: but those are the top 5 imo
[1:57:30] JakloomGaming770: wasnt he banned for a while
[1:57:33] Roxxybolts: he's prob top 100
[1:57:33] ryanblue98: @varok87 lol you just looked top of ladder
[1:57:34] What_ln_Tarnation: top 5k lock
[1:57:37] style5z: @heymomimonttv he's high on ladder when he tries, but he's banned from competing so hard to compare
[1:57:37] Salanzo: he doesnt compete cause when he did he got stuck with Crusader and we all know how that goes..
[1:57:37] Roxxybolts: 99ish
[1:57:43] varok87: @ryanblue98 Kappa
[1:57:43] chaps_86: Buffarcane = goat
[1:57:44] Omnadren: S+ tier for sure
[1:57:45] pattarx: best warlock is @BanthaBantha
[1:57:48] DemoDreamlol: Tough 😂😂
[1:57:48] numero5218: buffarcane zaddy
[1:57:56] cornflakes_au_getchop: what is this thing
[1:57:59] heymomimonttv: yea maldiva is banned from competing so he cant compete. he would be nasty in competitions tho and has competed many times
[1:58:05] wildlight_dru: Can you show your disc talents?
[1:58:13] happyheals: Cdew is a really good lock
[1:58:15] thunderxmvp: Fun thing is, supa is top 3 on lock ladder in solo haha
[1:58:23] bjjamm: wait why is he banned from competing?
[1:58:24] FateIRL: maldiva said he got banned for liking a tweet
[1:58:27] FateIRL: which is strange
[1:58:34] What_ln_Tarnation: unless you a rogue
[1:58:36] j0j0j0j0j0j0: mitchjones, maldiva, metaphors. best 3s team ive ever seen
[1:58:37] Roxxybolts: maldiva would be top 3 aff locks prob
[1:58:39] style5z: i've been watching since BFA and I've never seen him compete, not going to compare current competitors to those 3+ years past
[1:58:42] varok87: @FateIRL isnt RMT?
[1:58:48] numero5218: doubtful that’s the full story also what’s the content of the tweet
[1:58:48] thunderxmvp: Chan plays lock only though, darth chan is literally a meme
[1:59:05] style5z: that said i play lock and learned everything fomr maldiva hes insane
[1:59:11] DemoDreamlol: @roxxybolts  he's pretty solid demo too imo
[1:59:15] heymomimonttv: maldiva got banned for "bigotry" type shit i believe. but that may have been his twitch ban and not his competing ban
[1:59:24] Roxxybolts: prob he doesn't play much demo tho atm
[1:59:28] pattarx: @FateIRL more complicated than that. he has repeatedly echoed and amplified hateful stuff on the internet. guys is good at wow but a huge incel weirdo
[1:59:30] wompstoleyourlotus: HOW is supa #3 destro in solo, that's wild
[1:59:37] Supcore: What is all the fuzz about Venruki these days? Have not seen him winning any Mens Arnolds Classics Body Building contest this year? So please explain!
[1:59:42] ryanblue98: pridefull rank 1 many got carried in 5s
[1:59:47] Supcore: It is Copy Pasta please do not ban D:
[2:00:09] wackpoetic: Maldiva violated Twitch's Community Guidelines, primarily around Civility and Respect
[2:00:10] Supcore: And a freindly hi (:

[2:24:09] Galirom: absolutely
[2:24:11] FateIRL: what is that
[2:24:19] NovaKosova: No one can give a factual based answer but... how much did Solo Q impact 3s, its so hard to find people to push 3s rating now :(
[2:24:22] slimthicknasty9999: supaRap supaRap supaRap supaRap supaRap supaRap

[2:26:13] s0leris21: how can this go live?
[2:26:26] wackpoetic: Need to see Bastion hitboxes. Only reason Bastion was balanced was because of his huge hitboxes
[2:26:29] Luigicamp: oh good, maybe now I can play it too
[2:26:47] wackpoetic: now if everyone has Bastion-sized hitboxes why play anyone else?
[2:27:10] s0leris21: exactly - that is my point - is that intended?
[2:27:12] vmills: your character naming is too funny

[2:29:59] Acurarx: Absterge is a good guy. He doesn’t have one of those sketchy origin stories like others who I won’t mention.
[2:30:01] Mcaveryst: what shoulders are those
[2:30:16] nikthevoker: parappa the rapper time?!
[2:30:19] wackpoetic: apologize to Mystical Madge
[2:30:40] happyheals: Absterge is the guy who looks like he arrives to tear shit down, but ends up being suprisingly responsible
[2:31:26] Acurarx: I remember a lot of these folks from Xfire. That’s all I’ll say.

[2:36:18] DemoDreamlol: roxxy playing DH cause it has no keybinds cause his damn mouse broke ='DDD
[2:36:19] Moobot: Latest video "Demon Hunters are impossible to kill" view it here: youtu.be/lX4aJQJ5oiY
[2:37:40] Galirom: I was just looking through my old emails, I got my we never ice block hoodie 9 years ago, thats INSANE
[2:38:00] lordelenath: just do more damage ven
[2:38:08] Badasti: it is awful atm... i think the stat change was the biggest culprit
[2:38:08] SweatyDaniels: fistweavers dont need to drink
[2:38:09] 인터넷포트: just sit 1 target
[2:38:22] Rakitotv: play arcane?
[2:38:29] 인터넷포트: to many swaps i feel like helps them
[2:38:37] skez_live: so what the meta, FW, Rsham,Rdruid then
[2:38:49] lordelenath: mage/lock is especially bad on the damp though i feel. those games almost always go the distance.
[2:39:20] Badasti: before this stupid stat change i could end games with frost bomb > glacial > ray, not its like i can get someone to half health, gg blizzard Kappa
[2:39:31] Nickystr1x: dragonflight, more like drinkingflight
[2:39:39] kusoneko: how do you solve this? more damage?
[2:39:42] Badasti: now*
[2:39:43] troniixlol: thats how my life is also
[2:39:52] lordelenath: can you ask blizzard to remove drinking from arena please @venruki ? it doesnt add anything interesting and it makes balancing healers way harder.
[2:39:52] wackpoetic: One of my favorite things about Solo Shuff is that there's no drinking for mana
[2:40:15] R1_Prototype: remove man’s from arena while you’re at it
[2:40:20] Badasti: they need to remove MS< the game is balanced around MS effects. And classes that have them do the same or more dam as classes that dont, it's so obnoxious
[2:40:24] R1_Prototype: mana **
[2:41:19] wackpoetic: I like the active longer CD MS effects, Psyfiend/Sharpen for example. Giving certain specs passive MS like Demo/WW/DH feels weird. I don't think MS is the problem though
[2:41:56] lordelenath: @Badasti but w/o MS games would get even more damp. if we were to remove that, we would've to nerf healing across the board - bc increasing damage to balance would just increase random oneshots.
[2:42:02] figurines: @wackpoetic its def an issue.
[2:42:13] Badasti: @lordelenath it wouldnt because they can balance the game around not having them
[2:42:22] figurines: @lordelenath its because games are balanced around MS. MS isn't the solution to that issue its the problem
[2:42:31] Badasti: @wackpoetic 25-50% ms is exactly like having a buff that gives your WHOLE team 25-50% more damage
[2:42:33] wackpoetic: figurines i'll trust your opinion when you name 5 anime fights better than Rock Lee vs Gaara
[2:42:49] Xeliumimar: guys if you want a free glad this season, q destro rsham dh
[2:42:50] figurines: @wackpoetic pick any 5 fights from hunter hunter. *shrug*
[2:43:02] lordelenath: @Badasti its not. giving your team +25-50% dmg will oneshot targets in a second. MS has a different effect.
[2:43:18] heymomimonttv: @wackpoetic any of the fights from samurai champloo, baki, kengan ashura or whatever its called
[2:43:25] Pepzsi: this music with gnome mage is perfect :D
[2:44:46] bsg_wiz: I love gnome casters b u get huge animations on this tiny guy lol makes the stuff like soul fire look enormous
[2:45:00] Ambersulfr: tiny but mighty
[2:45:01] bsg_wiz: or pyro
[2:45:04] bsg_wiz: yeah!
[2:45:09] Badasti: @lordelenath you're missing the point, I'm not saying it's exactly the same, but an enemy healer would still need to heal 25-50% more to keep something alive, so the game is balanced around it
[2:45:09] lordelenath: gnoems are just all-around awesome
[2:45:27] Xeliumimar: how fun, a dh/healer vs dh 2v2 now lol
[2:45:28] Cvarks: i didnt even know he was in call w u guys
[2:45:29] Cvarks: couldnt hear him
[2:45:30] Cvarks: KEKW
[2:45:31] n3v3rlukky: there are 3 people in discord?
[2:45:36] Rakitotv: yah hes barely coming through stream so faintly
[2:45:38] lordelenath: @Badasti yes, but if you take out MS you'd have to nerf HPS, not buff DPS. buffing dps would give you oneshots all around.
[2:45:41] bimboou: bro used arcane surge one in the game lol
[2:45:44] sleightxyz: @wackpoetic I can give one, the final fight in Sword of the Stranger
[2:46:03] Badasti: @lordelenath where did i say buff dps?
[2:46:03] vmills: all I hear is “get the cool get the cool shoe shine lalalala” haha
[2:46:20] Peacetreaty4: do better for bimboou
[2:46:25] heymomimonttv: @bimboou if u twitch prime he'll surge more. guaranteed

[2:46:54] wackpoetic: most of my personal favorite anime fight scenes are in the arrancar saga from bleach but ty for your responses chat
[2:47:13] DemoDreamlol: roxxy loves you so i love you ='D
[2:47:17] bimboou: u have to release spirit otherwise u get kicked fro AFK
[2:48:17] Neriakied: would be cool if release in arena just gave you a follow cam on ur team like every other game
[2:48:35] DemoDreamlol: @Neriakied preeeach
[2:48:51] Neriakied: makes the 2v2 more hype
[2:49:02] Badasti: this reminds me of the old school tank duels that put everyone to sleep
[2:49:26] Badasti: wheover cranks the healer better
[2:49:29] chaps_86: roxxy all the way
[2:49:33] chaps_86: i have faith
[2:49:34] DemoDreamlol: if roxxy loses i will gift 5 subs to him
[2:49:36] R1_Prototype: rofl the amount of nobodies that think streamers need their advice is actually insane. it’s fine to comment. suggest. maybe they didn’t think of it. sure. but I really don’t get the negging.
[2:49:37] snikiwii: whats the addon for totem names?
[2:49:38] whspe: its mystical in 2s though

[2:49:47] heymomimonttv: i want roxxy to win, but shaman drank to full so it's gg there
[2:49:51] Badasti: i think he's gotta go healer and forget the enemy dh

[2:52:05] Ambersulfr: only one person gets to have fun in 3s rn, sorry
[2:52:07] lordelenath: the biggest downside to being the caster in a caster/melee/heal comp: always the target.
[2:52:41] bimboou: frost rules
[2:52:41] bruce_t_wayne: it feels like mage looses a lot of dps if trained all game compared to lock
[2:53:07] JpLEF: damn, just caught an ad break that played the same ad on repeat for 2 minutes
[2:53:11] heymomimonttv: prob cuz locks have a dot at least

[2:53:17] Koraszdormu: rotfl.  Just saw the 1v1 against the Boo.  Don't worry, Ven.  I'm with you.  He was sweating a few times in that match.
[2:53:30] TheGRIMDAWG: @bruce_t_wayne locks have one of the best absorbs, on a 40 second cd and useable whilst stunned :P
[2:53:40] Badasti: i honestly think there;s a place for a mana gem build for arcane, for the 2 clearcasting stacks + 5% dam
[2:53:50] Salanzo: were u running ascendance against pikaboo or the proc talent
[2:54:07] bruce_t_wayne: oh yeah that makes sense
[2:54:19] popzirl: i just awkwardly tabbed to an earthen and got it to 50% with one death sweep so i just finished it
[2:54:33] ramenxo: saw another tier list on youtube this morning that had DH in low A tier high B tier for arena and it felt like paid propoganda

[2:59:40] Lugges48: ppl play fire with 40% versa

[3:07:48] kand1nsky: leech is nerfed by 50% in arena no?
[3:08:05] CHMage: the healing you get from leech enchants is insignificant tho, right? @venruki
[3:08:06] R1_Prototype: so does that make “indestructible” the only one that functions in arena?
[3:08:11] Mhortai: Good afternoon @venruki

[4:06:18] gdodmebxu: but i can't do it
[4:06:29] Badasti: i used to play without shimmer, if you get used to ice floes its not too bad, but nothing beats shimmering to get a poly, or shimmering to get a cast off etc
[4:06:51] gdodmebxu: shimmering the end of the cast when they think they lined it is so nice

[5:01:55] Badasti: in general many countries in EU are nanny states... I think there are generally stricter controls
[5:01:58] CabinetMistake: cheese making processes for one need stainless steel but wood mostly in europe
[5:02:00] OhJayP: i feel like the worst is your water
[5:02:02] squarepusher_: There are plenty of things banned everywhere, with a lot of overlap.
[5:02:04] NEVERSAYDIE27: also people like to shit on US just for the sake of it
[5:02:05] CabinetMistake: egg starching as well
[5:02:06] BoboLost: yeah, kinder eggs are banned in us
[5:02:11] OhJayP: like it has no minerals
[5:02:18] OhJayP: but thats not for health reasons no?
[5:02:19] swolecolemole: smokeless tobacco not allowed, was big sad on vacation
[5:02:23] swolecolemole: in EU
[5:02:26] Badasti: like in the UK i can only buy 1 box of ibuprofen per month... the government here treats you like you're stupid
[5:02:28] CabinetMistake: not food but anti-smoking campaign worked insanely well in the US but EU smoking still common yeah
[5:02:33] Blightrose: @BoboLost yeah because american kids just ate the whole egg and choked on the toy inside
[5:02:54] Badasti: @CabinetMistake thats not true
[5:03:09] Badasti: the majority of smokers in the EU have stopped
[5:03:13] Badasti: the vast majority
[5:03:18] happyheals: The dead ones
[5:03:27] Badasti: no, people ahve just stopped,
[5:03:39] astrry: bubblegum flavoured smoking bullshit is super common among young people I think
[5:03:51] CabinetMistake: @Badasti it is still true if you look at the statistics from the past few years
[5:04:02] CabinetMistake: but getting better for sure
[5:04:07] jfeliciano007: what's going on? I have to keep afking and every time I come back it's same team different map lol
[5:04:17] addyz0r: one pack on smokers of 20 are 10-20 usd in Scandinavia
[5:04:29] Badasti: @CabinetMistake from which country dude, because I live in EU and I was a smoker for like 16 years. There were massive campaigns to stop smoking, and like 90% of the smokers I knew including me have stopped
[5:04:48] rembrandt89: i mean a pack in some us states are those prices too
[5:04:58] Badasti: most places I go i never see smokers anymore, and ive lived in 2 countries
[5:05:15] FateIRL: @Badasti what country?
[5:05:23] Badasti: Estonia, now the UK
[5:05:26] biofreaks: hugeee bust hansolGasm
[5:05:28] CabinetMistake: just google it bro
[5:05:37] CabinetMistake: not gonna link academic papers in a wow pvp twitch chat
[5:05:39] FateIRL: try eastern europe
[5:05:41] FateIRL: everyone smokes
[5:06:04] Badasti: @CabinetMistake bro I was a smoker for 16 years, I don't need google to notice that I used to see dozens of smokers and now most days I dont see a single one LUL
[5:06:06] rembrandt89: smoking in the us is very common any one who says its not doesnt go outside
[5:06:12] ATHLTE: been in classs... hows this comp goin
[5:06:24] R1_Prototype: anti smoking is just vaping in the us. and even big tobacco owns that now. vaping has surely helped a lot of people quit and kept kids from ever smoking that first cigarette.
[5:06:26] CabinetMistake: @Badasti that's called anecdotal evidence
[5:06:39] FateIRL: i will never see a smoker too if leave the house once a month
[5:07:19] Slandii: Yo @venruki thinking of picking up healer to get faster  Q's. What would u say is easiest heal spec to pick up?

[5:08:47] Badasti: @Badasti guess im just lucky that everyone I see supports it
[5:08:59] bwillyboy: raise base damage and reduce those crit modifiers you were talking about maybe
[5:09:01] jondoe2239: increase the damage of pyro and fireball baseline and remove glass cannon
[5:09:05] addyz0r: i commend them on changing damage profile in df. the old casting 10 spells that did nothing was bad
[5:09:30] Reiumi_: EZ
[5:09:33] addyz0r: I'm old and I
[5:09:35] cantfindthebox: 9hrs a day is rookie numbers, gotta pump those numbers up bro
[5:09:40] nightmxz: Fire needs nerf to combust modifiers and then buff baseline damage, buff scorch to be relevant outside of execute (even in execute it's kinda bad)
[5:09:45] fatlittlepaypig: game hasnt felt this bad since ret rework imo
[5:09:55] addyz0r: i'm old and i'm a rager PepoCheer
[5:09:59] PsyqoSupreme: I almost resubbed yesterday, but then I thought about having to set up addons and I didn't pull the trigger. Such a huge barrier to entry
[5:10:00] wackpoetic: the game feels good to play but MMR is just so fried
[5:10:20] nightmxz: Fireball should be equivalent to incinerate and pyroblast a decent bit weaker than chaos bolt
[5:10:37] nightmxz: scorch should hit for as much as conflags
[5:10:49] Jubite: @venruki yo how did UHDK go from being so oppressive start of patch to this
[5:10:50] fatlittlepaypig: i never felt my bubbled get forced so easily on hpal before in my life
[5:10:55] fatlittlepaypig: bubble*
[5:11:02] Slandii: My reason is 100% Q times. When i only get a few hours a day to play, why would i wanna sit in Q for the majority of that.
[5:11:14] nightmxz: fireblast is dog shit because it's a builder, it needs to be redesigned if it does damage
[5:11:17] foxyllama: ya its perfect
[5:11:21] foxyllama: mages r broken
[5:11:29] niamha_: triple fireblast meteor blaster master, if you know you know
[5:11:34] fulvoustv: how hard does conflag hit?
[5:11:35] supatease: foxy we qing with ven sometime?
[5:11:49] jondoe2239: dont change firelbast, instead make phoenix flames CD reduced by haste
[5:11:53] fatlittlepaypig: they just need to balance damage properly and stop giving EVERYTHING CDR
[5:12:03] foxyllama: lmfao all of firemage dmg is messed up in numbers, ignite should never be top, active spells should be highest not passive
[5:12:06] fatlittlepaypig: cdr is the most broken shit in the game
[5:12:35] Roxxybolts: WE BROUGHT IT BACK
[5:12:38] foxyllama: i think ur casted spells hsould be honestly
[5:12:39] Roxxybolts: against all odds
[5:12:41] nightmxz: Fire needs a lot of changes lol
[5:12:47] kand1nsky: i mean ignite is basically teh rest of the spells
[5:12:55] bwillyboy: fireball 4% is... lower than i would like personally
[5:12:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Foxy can go fistweaver
[5:13:03] Roxxybolts: thank god foxy isn't VIP i'd hate to see that
[5:13:05] Vulvayer: same could be said about shamans, 90% of healing is insta
[5:13:06] supatease: fire is good its not just not invincible and at the top 1% thats all that matters to win
[5:13:07] frikaboy: just give back 1 minute busts omegalul
[5:13:07] foxyllama: @supatease idk what do i get out of this
[5:13:17] rockiyo: good song lol
[5:13:18] Draxxul: mastery

[5:13:20] blueberrypieface: mastery
[5:13:20] Reiumi_: mastery
[5:13:20] Jubite: mastery
[5:13:21] R1_Prototype: for pvp. they should make fire mages do knocks ups instead of some sort of slow. but they need something to help kite
[5:13:21] fatlittlepaypig: mastery
[5:13:22] dougdimaddome: its just mastery
[5:13:22] Von_Liechtenstein: Mastery
[5:13:25] jondoe2239: hpriest mastery
[5:13:26] sbrees: mastery of hpriest
[5:13:29] restosoup28: mastery passive
[5:13:29] rembrandt89: LUL
[5:13:30] Ladyazeroth01: heheh
[5:13:31] Guffels: idk what queue times are. I am a healer
[5:13:32] foxyllama: better than fire mage
[5:13:35] foxyllama: atleast
[5:13:44] Roxxybolts: pom #2
[5:13:45] supatease: thats the healing equiv of gushing wounds
[5:13:48] Roxxybolts: LUL
[5:13:53] foxyllama: but i still stand by the opint active healing/dmg should ALWAYS be ahead of passive healing/dmg
[5:14:00] ellisrainy: all i hear is anti fire mage agenda
[5:14:06] foxyllama: but blizzard likes passive things
[5:14:13] supatease: cuz of triune ward
[5:14:18] ellisrainy: yooo bro how u doing today?
[5:14:20] spfan87: lol
[5:14:22] popzirl: Soulscar (DoT)
[5:14:22] dakila24: they don't hate fire mages, they hate gnomes
[5:14:25] nightmxz: fire is toxic when it's good, boring to fight and you can't stop it's damage LUL
[5:14:33] fatlittlepaypig: at least damage mitigation works vs fire mages. on hpal i can have 70% reduction and still die in a stun to DH
[5:14:38] foxyllama: how is supa a mod man
[5:14:44] Roxxybolts: try stopping roxxydh
[5:14:44] foxyllama: and im not
[5:14:49] nightmxz: not frost and arcane :) just kick them
[5:14:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[5:14:53] Roxxybolts: please ven
[5:14:53] R1_Prototype: yeah that’s literally everything.
[5:14:56] Drob4ever: what do you use to record your gameplay?
[5:15:02] Roxxybolts: keep VIP and Mod away from this trashtalking llama
[5:15:18] josefstal55: what do you not like about SOD and classic?
[5:15:32] halbinder: fire mages still paying for the sins back from shadowlands
[5:15:35] fatlittlepaypig: the SoD blood moon pvp thing is a complete lag fest
[5:15:53] josefstal55: thats a fair point
[5:15:53] Moobot: Latest video "UPDATED 10.2 PvP Tier List! EVERY SPEC RANKED!" view it here: youtu.be/E2wCZf3wKiM
[5:15:55] R1_Prototype: @nightmxz if they let you. if they hard cast.
[5:16:00] rembrandt89: I hated fire more in bfa
[5:16:02] halbinder: will there be any class changes before awc?
[5:16:22] halbinder: so DH will remain that strong for several weeks ? lmao
[5:16:34] jacob_the_mage: aiyyowhatsupfam
[5:16:45] TheBiggestManOnCampus: trumpwrong.gif
[5:16:49] fatlittlepaypig: id like to think DH class lead or something made them op as shit before 10% of blizzard got fired in case he was one of them
[5:16:59] jondoe2239: i dont understand did something happen with dh recently? thjeyve literally been broken the entire xpac
[5:17:02] jacob_the_mage: oompa looma doopadeedoo
[5:17:02] Roxxybolts: wait next month is the new badge?
[5:17:24] jacob_the_mage: if you eat a lot then you will go poo
[5:17:30] prikaze: i think they should combine eu and na arenas shuffle cuz the que times are to long ffs
[5:17:39] rembrandt89: dh has not been broken the whole expansion
[5:17:58] Roxxybolts: speakers if you wanna do that you need to get some reps with in with the dumbbells
[5:18:04] jondoe2239: youre right theyve been broken since SL
[5:18:06] Dourme: combine every server on world so i can find a group in lfg
[5:18:10] fatlittlepaypig: you get a cyclone, he gets a cyclone, everyone gets a cyclone!
[5:18:15] bit0x: play healer for short que Kappa
[5:18:15] Fubo12: tcat and owl standing on a tree
[5:18:16] Izzythediscpriest: so many clones lol
[5:18:17] halbinder: they should us just give something to do inbetween, like a skrimish or something
[5:18:21] halbinder: a big one
[5:18:22] R1_Prototype: I think they don’t want death knights to be the best class they added after classic. so they aren’t letting DH be awful at it’s only two jobs.
[5:18:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: DxCat DxCat DxCat
[5:18:24] Jubite: What happened to UHDK from start of patch to make them drop to B in your tier list?

[5:19:54] R1_Prototype: clone does have a short range. if he stays back he might fugg up the whole plan.
[5:20:19] supatease: is ur tier list solo shuffle or 3v3 cuz disc is not D tier in shuffle
[5:20:42] foxyllama: u tell em supa

[5:22:55] Badasti: and 3's
[5:23:20] supatease: also dont think holy priest is that good i think its a fluke it did so well

[5:36:55] TheBiggestManOnCampus: is dvoker hard in your opinion?
[5:37:04] CabinetMistake: this is a dumb Q but if you sit in ring of fire does it do more damage than if you're only in it for a few seconds and then leave?
[5:37:08] Lugges48: would it be more with more mastery?
[5:37:16] icepresso: please show the build stats and gear
[5:37:18] fatlittlepaypig: is this what happens when you give every class a unique mastery??? :O
[5:37:23] ripzaddo: @CabinetMistake yea it can reapply
[5:37:30] CabinetMistake: @ripzaddo okay ty! i was wondering
[5:37:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I would imaging you need some haste to get poly casts off
[5:37:48] fatlittlepaypig: can you imagine sitting in a board room pitching the mastery idea today. a stat that you have to balance uniquely around every single spec
[5:38:36] icepresso: do uevenr swap out flamecanon if its a small map with a melee cleave
[5:38:57] icepresso: to get the blink slow
[5:39:00] quinoasalad112: pop into the stream to an absolutely godly song
[5:39:08] icepresso: like i refuse to put a talent on slow
[5:39:15] icepresso: i never press it it feels very akward
[5:39:22] icepresso: its only good vs warrior
[5:39:29] Meadamemnon: I just cant play ranged DPS anymore, all the melee uptime and pseudo interrupts made me hate the game. Then to counter, ranged has precog and all instant casts. Love watching you play though. @venruki
[5:39:29] icepresso: eveyrthing else catches up to you with slow
[5:39:42] zachgamegodx: crusader would flame u so hard if u didnt spec slow
[5:40:25] ericpowerful: does anyone care what crusader thinks?
[5:40:59] Sundagar: crusader is a bad meme
[5:41:05] icepresso: crusader gets rank 1 only when playing with other rank 1s ... without them he is a top 1000 player nothing special
[5:41:26] boomkin_exploit: who is crusader?
[5:41:35] Sundagar: @boomkin_exploit exactly
[5:41:51] Cerion17: playlist is fire

[5:42:09] R1_Prototype: I mean, that goes for anyone at the top tho. it’s teams that win. not individuals.
[5:44:12] boomkin_exploit: as soon as u get rank 1 with them, u r "playing with other rank 1s"
[5:44:12] Schwenkyytv: thats how bicmex got his first R1
[5:44:31] R1_Prototype: 🎵 is Florence Welch for anyone that’s uncultured

[5:48:50] yab_xd: it was ww2 propaganda
[5:49:01] blightclub: carrots have beta carotene which is what vit A is derived from
[5:49:03] WojoFog: think its about a vitamin that is in the carrot (dont remember which? A E?) that helps the eyes adjust to darkness
[5:49:04] MalafisTV: No, the myth was that carrots improve night vision. They were using that to hide the fact they were using radar
[5:49:08] skwiglz: 100 percent correct

[6:31:41] famous1939: free publicity
[6:31:44] chrisiirc: he calls you "peasantruki"
[6:31:47] chrisiirc: LUL
[6:32:05] Badasti: i wasnt here for the convo i missed, but I did watch crusader watch your watch party of the awc
[6:32:20] Badasti: the dude cant hide it, he was smiling the whole time
[6:32:31] Badasti: was actually quite endearing to watch
[6:32:37] vandirne: I always thought crusader was playing a character for stream. Until after a year of stopping in and watching him. Crusader is.....crusader, no character well, yeah
[6:32:37] chrisiirc: ya he likes ven for sure
[6:33:08] chrisiirc: now that i see it....
[6:33:11] FateIRL: no
[6:33:13] neunMilli: yes
[6:33:17] chrisiirc: omg...
[6:33:18] Hizuru1: slightly is understatement
[6:33:20] themanw1thaplan: No
[6:33:26] Badasti: it used to bother me but tbh i havent thought about it in months
[6:33:29] vandirne: I shed a single tear everytine I see it
[6:33:30] honsou2: its a crazy choice
[6:33:34] Badasti: you get used to it LUL
[6:33:37] pharmztko: rukiEw
[6:33:39] VetisBR: you are a podcast for me so i never look
[6:33:52] Guffels: ya same
[6:34:24] youngthapper: bm isnt anywhere in teh top players tho?
[6:34:29] Badasti: what class does bigdam play?
[6:34:33] Vigi9413: arms being A is generous
[6:34:36] chrisiirc: enhance ofc
[6:34:39] pharmztko: enhance
[6:34:42] Badasti: ah
[6:35:08] honsou2: DH and Rogue are just more skilled than the rest
[6:35:34] madwinterz: funny how the second highest zug class is about 5% lower than DH
[6:35:35] chrisiirc: skill issue i think
[6:35:36] Dizzlx: thats funny first two alts i lvld after coming back to the game were dh / druid
[6:35:38] chrisiirc: LUL
[6:35:40] Badasti: well i still like my mage even though it stresses me out, maybe this means we'll get buffed next patch
[6:35:41] Vigi9413: do dk's still have a negative win rate in shuffle
[6:36:27] honsou2: dk did a full hero to zero this season :( i just wanted that red sword
[6:36:31] Schwenkyytv: wheres all the combat rogues at?
[6:36:52] FateIRL: dh is in every shuffle
[6:36:53] youngthapper: if dh is obviously busted in pvp and pve by a ridiculous margin why dont devs just nerf it? like is there no intent to balance?
[6:37:01] biofreaks: DH is how most classes should be designed. Not too much button bloat, they have everything.
[6:37:04] cutexlol_: and im on my way to be a part of it :)
[6:37:07] Vigi9413: i admit i'm part of the problem
[6:37:07] Yanari_x: It's not even funny anymore
[6:37:11] Badasti: I just wonder if whoever is responsible for PvP at blizzard even looks at shit like this
[6:37:16] honsou2: @biofreaks no
[6:37:17] Hizuru1: DH is fun simple as that
[6:37:23] TrippThree: Thought you were playing Hpal??
[6:37:24] FlyFYI: The devs are dhs
[6:37:30] Dupreme_Weems: based
[6:37:32] Schwenkyytv: combat rogues are S tier also but only played like in 5% of games
[6:37:33] madwinterz: nerf it to the ground and call it fun still Kappa
[6:37:37] Badasti: DH isnt that fun... it's basic and low stress, low risk high reward
[6:37:40] marvin1995xo: are u excited for cata arenas ?
[6:37:45] Secretwombatbro: rotation is real funky though
[6:37:46] honsou2: @Hizuru1 its a boring anime class fantasy class with 3 buttons. 0 people play it when its weak
[6:37:53] chrisiirc: nope
[6:37:57] jacob_the_mage: No
[6:37:58] clicket: not at all lol
[6:38:00] jacob_the_mage: cata gonna be dung water
[6:38:00] SerFloyd: not really
[6:38:01] biofreaks: no
[6:38:01] CoffeeMmm: wait did they announce cata ?
[6:38:02] Vigi9413: a little
[6:38:03] Hizuru1: @honsou2 who ever says 3 buttons does not play.
[6:38:03] Badasti: i want to try mage in cata, i didnt main mage back then
[6:38:03] chrisiirc: retail has got the pace i like
[6:38:04] Thoreya: like 6/10
[6:38:06] highmoon7: no, cata was the downfall of wow
[6:38:07] Dizzlx: cata arena was very good
[6:38:08] marvin1995xo: idk what to play i never played cata
[6:38:09] jacob_the_mage: retail andy 4 life
[6:38:11] jacob_the_mage: for me
[6:38:12] ellisrainy: I want to love classic but the end game just gets so boring so fast
[6:38:13] Thoreya: i want mop
[6:38:14] whitecrox: cata ResidentSleeper
[6:38:16] itz_killjoy: bfa classic soon
[6:38:17] Smexxin: too much qol lost from playing old stuff for me
[6:38:18] Vigi9413: i'm ready for cata raids
[6:38:20] bigolemooseknuckle: Cata is fun but MoP is so much better
[6:38:30] honsou2: @Hizuru1 anime confirmed, stereotype correct yet again
[6:38:35] marvin1995xo: i wish i could level in classic while im in solo queue
[6:38:36] Badasti: i started RBG's in cata and really enjoyed it. I had a great time doing RBG's in MOP too
[6:38:45] CoffeeMmm: cata pvp start of season gearing was the best thing ever
[6:38:52] CoffeeMmm: mages were gods though
[6:38:53] Smexxin: think it would be fun to just see class design of stuff cuz i didnt play at the start
[6:38:55] CoffeeMmm: especially in duels
[6:38:56] cutexlol_: last season of cata is fucking hilarious with legendaries/pve weapons/trinkets but i loved it LUL
[6:38:57] ellisrainy: I might give that a try that sounds fun
[6:38:57] HsBud: pvp power and pvp defense?
[6:38:58] MachoGG: @Smexxin how so :0
[6:39:01] Dizzlx: cata arena is just a better version of wrath and a less non-crazy version of mop
[6:39:10] TheNutcracka: well dragonsoul trinkets and sword were pretty strong in arena
[6:39:25] ellisrainy: think I'm done with sod I can't bring myself to level, already lvl 40s camping all the lvling zones just cba lol
[6:39:33] Smexxin: id probably play aff i played it
[6:40:02] symptomV: what u think about the new warband
[6:40:05] TuanmaccaiW: world of demonhuntercraft is getting so old
[6:40:06] FateIRL: aeghis said its just as bad as the ret rework
[6:40:09] biofreaks: DH is fun to play, simple and strong. Whats not to like.
[6:40:09] skez_live: I hope wow at some day converges back to just 1 version that everyone plays lol
[6:40:11] Schwenkyytv: its the mix of them being easy af to play and being strong
[6:40:19] Vigi9413: buff dk's
[6:40:23] Zenlyn: I wonder what data they look at for wow balancing, shuffle? 3s? awc?
[6:40:24] highmoon7: rdruid op as an nothing changing there either
[6:40:26] honsou2: @Schwenkyytv no its just them being silly OP
[6:40:29] tinkbelledhtv: Dh is for sl xpac can 1 shot with hunt
[6:40:30] galdinator: Make gearing too easy and everyone will reroll fotm at the drop of a hat
[6:40:30] cutexlol_: only 1 dps specc... maybe thats why they're not getting nerfed bc you cant really change things up
[6:40:34] Bernablaw: what does that chart means?
[6:40:40] Hazythe4Saken: Tessellate... good shit
[6:40:49] Lancin1987: Thoughts on Assassination rogue now?
[6:41:02] honsou2: theyre not getting nerfed because the wow pvp team is 3 girls with blue hair and they still arent sure why they did the last patch
[6:41:04] marvin1995xo: no tuning in like a month by now
[6:41:12] Hizuru1: Quit game guys if they nerf your spec money talks :P
[6:41:18] booba1421: Can you open data for EU @Ven
[6:41:18] wraithchill: dk does need survivability buffs to compensate
[6:41:25] everquest101: dks got nuked  each season and guted dont expect buffs vigi
[6:41:28] tinkbelledhtv: Dh can do big heals outta random
[6:41:38] Schwenkyytv: @honsou2 combat rogues and destro are OP too ? why dont people play them as much? maybe cause they are harder
[6:41:41] fistweaveurnan: @marvin1995xo hahahaha pr sure its been 2 almost 3 man
[6:41:46] chrisiirc: DH allow new players to play the game
[6:41:49] dialupinternetconnection: nether
[6:41:49] chrisiirc: essentially
[6:41:51] biofreaks: I wish they would turn individual spells too. There are SOO many useless spells b/c they are under tuned. for example divine star.
[6:41:52] dryangore: it's cuz they are mid air activating meta
[6:41:52] healhut: pre-nether the nerf SeemsGood
[6:41:53] wraithchill: dk dead twice in one xpac
[6:41:55] Samurayny: Devs nephew is playing DH, once he gets his achievments theil nerf it
[6:42:01] everquest101: because dks counter   most casters and the qq  is inmense
[6:42:04] honsou2: @Schwenkyytv they arent as OP and funny enough theyre the two specs behind DH?
[6:42:06] FateIRL: they want to see dh in the awc so ppl dont say its only rogues
[6:42:11] youngthapper: devs are probably getting paid off by bug dh industry to keep them buffed
[6:42:12] Badasti: holy shit thats true, DK's had like a couple weeks of fun and they werent even as strong as demon hunters and they got beaten by the nerf bat
[6:42:12] e10100111001: which healer is the best at kiting dh?
[6:42:15] srslysnek: I mostly play DK, they needed tuning, whole discord knew it was coming. but how is DH immune
[6:42:21] Zenlyn: man i made a dps class, a warrior, just to mess around on when im bored and these shuffle queues make me wanna log off? how can u guys do this
[6:42:36] cutexlol_: im going to main DH now because of health reasons... you dnt need like 7 mio buttons... you can just vibe LUL
[6:42:41] srslysnek: watch ven while waiting
[6:42:50] Hizuru1: @Zenlyn normal people play different games oe 2s 3s.
[6:42:51] srslysnek: cry a little, etc
[6:42:54] Vigi9413: i wait on my warrior just to get punted by leather wearing melee classes lol
[6:42:54] itz_killjoy: you play other games while alt tabbed, duh
[6:42:58] chrisiirc: i rerolled a healer...
[6:43:02] Sundagar: yeah i got into 2 games over 2 hours today, and i dont have the courage / friends to try 2v2/3v3 so solo shuff afking it is
[6:43:04] Badasti: @Zenlyn make a second account with a healer, play 1 round of healer while oyu wait for shuff queue
[6:43:05] everquest101: unholy needs a total rework is just bloated  bad spec prone to nerfs since bfa, frost is just dead since  chill sdtreak heartstop buff
[6:43:06] ellisrainy: I just hope the solo rbg mode pops off in 11.0 and we get fixed solo q, feels like they've abandoned shuff a little
[6:43:08] Badasti: and watch streams LUL
[6:43:11] galdinator: @Zenlyn you just gotta reallyyy hate healing
[6:43:12] twinbladeuk: 40 min Q's EZ watch people mald on twitch
[6:43:14] Badasti: and do some crusader curls
[6:43:36] ellisrainy: oh I posted a short about this today looool
[6:43:39] Schwenkyytv: @honsou2 combat rogue being played 5% of melee in SS above 2100 but DH is played 25% of the time. combat rogues are just as OP but much harder to play.
[6:43:47] ellisrainy: farming the dhs
[6:43:52] Blaze150000: why no 2x Dh comps in awc LUL
[6:44:00] biofreaks: The classes with the most dmg negating abilities are at the bottom.
[6:44:25] Badasti: most tanky, most dam, least likely to be killed, has an ms effect, most mobility if not rooted, like every dr with micro cc etc
[6:44:34] healhut: does chaotic imprint stack?
[6:44:44] honsou2: someone should have played it to save the season. L
[6:44:46] healhut: or whatev its called
[6:45:01] goosalagoopagoo: hi all in new how is fistweaver in arena?
[6:45:06] orcrimmar: finally made a dragon. They're pretty fun. Healing is a bit awkward though imo

[6:45:46] Hizuru1: intentionally removed specs below post LUL Canadian journalism at finest
[6:45:47] Incin_gaming: can you not i just hit level 65 oon dh LOL
[6:45:49] Lancin1987: Did you watch the video palumor Did watching you play against a outlaw using a busted macro?
[6:45:50] srslysnek: retpocalypse still giving me the 1000 yard stare
[6:45:51] twinbladeuk: @beep101boop no need to Kappa
[6:46:00] Hizuru1: below dh specs
[6:46:02] moremantella255: ret aint even that great rn tbh
[6:46:05] honsou2: retpocalypse killed df pvp and DH danced on the grave
[6:46:25] Bonegraft: keep posting on DH, im leveling my lock now dont let them notice
[6:46:33] srslysnek: @moremantella255 only cause there's better ranged classes Kappa
[6:46:33] Darnias: Does blizzard really need community outcry to do class balance?
[6:46:38] biofreaks: Without reworking classes, what changes would you like to see? Maybe add % changes too. Example buff disc 5% everything etc
[6:46:46] goosalagoopagoo: @venruki how is fistweaver in arena ?

[6:50:04] Lancin1987: I feel like a lot of non rogue streamers/players put rogues higher on tier lists even when they are not good, to keep them bad because most non rogue players hate rogues lol
[6:50:08] jporter_: I mean blizz has to already know. There's no point
[6:50:10] Vigi9413: embrace the meta.. then once they nerf it to the ground it hurts that much more
[6:50:12] booba1421: No DH in your lobby 😁
[6:50:14] honsou2: @Roidb0y no it wouldnt theyre a good comp together and DH owns DK
[6:50:14] twinbladeuk: no dh in this lobby BUFF DH!
[6:50:15] Incin_gaming: its your own opinion but you got the pull to make it happen lmao
[6:50:15] snulli: do you think the mmr rn is scuffed ven?
[6:50:25] pharmztko: @lancin1987 KEKW
[6:50:37] Lancin1987: Assassination is trash right now
[6:50:42] Lancin1987: Look at the chsrts
[6:50:45] tinkbelledhtv: I like priest
[6:50:57] cutexlol_: i wish i was able to play rogue Sadge
[6:51:04] Badasti: the game needs to be balanced for high ratings, not the donkeys down in wood rank
[6:51:09] Schwenkyytv: but they are harder to play compared to DH, there are so many DHs because of how easy they are to play
[6:51:25] Jun_bug__: we need to buff everyclass fug it
[6:51:31] Lancin1987: 1 rogue spec being good doesn't make them all good
[6:51:39] Smexxin: wood rank players matter too BibleThump @Badasti
[6:51:41] honsou2: @Lancin1987 theres assa rogue higher rated than any dks or warriors or rets, how is it trash?
[6:52:41] neoxue: Just because 1 of the 3 specs of rogue isn't equally as good as the other two. Doesn't make rogue NOT good lol
[6:52:41] malvarcla: show em your big bust omg
[6:52:46] TroyanaTKO: BUST HUHH
[6:53:20] Lancin1987: @honsou2 not overall
[6:53:25] pharmztko: rogues think they need 3 s tier specs to be good
[6:53:37] honsou2: @Lancin1987 So? That means nothing, what does mean something is the top
[6:53:40] vanncleff: Why do you suffer so much, Venruki? :/
[6:54:39] Lancin1987: @honsou2 because only looking at the very top players isn't a realistic example of the player base.
[6:54:45] neoxue: Like saying mage isn't that good because fire isn't as good as frost or arcane
[6:54:55] tinkbelledhtv: I just wanna have a cold alcoholic beverage
[6:55:01] princesstoni01: hey bestie x
[6:55:08] Badasti: @Smexxin I am a donkey in wood rank. LUL   I still think I matter, but it makes no sense to balance it any other way. I'm fine knowing that there's still stuff I can learn to get better
[6:55:14] honsou2: @Lancin1987 neither is looking at the rest when outlaw and sub are extremely OP? DUHHH no one is on assa while the other two specs dominate the entire game. Meanwhile assa the worst rogue spec can still acheive higher rating than ANY plate class on any of their specs
[6:56:12] Dizzlx: ret affi rdru seems pretty tough for you guys
[6:56:25] Lancin1987: @honsou2 I'm not talking about sub and outlaw, I am only looking at Assassination. That's like saying aff is good because destro is S tier
[6:56:36] tinkbelledhtv: Lmao
[6:56:48] princesstoni01: GARBANZO!
[6:56:54] Boskey2016: @venruki   i know you likely feel you're past that point in your life but is there anything that could respark your competitive drive to go for an awc team?
[6:56:56] Jun_bug__: but Aff is good?
[6:57:00] honsou2: @Lancin1987 no its like saying aff is good because aff is higher rated than all other caster specs except Destro which is higher rated than aff... My god you cant be from 87
[6:57:31] Smexxin: the player experience can be vastly different at lower vs higher ratings though. even if there's potential to get better it's important to keep those perspectives as a priority too
[6:57:56] Lancin1987: Ho
[6:58:33] Lancin1987: @honsou2 why are you even comparing dk anyway? DK is garbage too
[6:58:40] Lancin1987: I admit that
[6:58:56] Jun_bug__: why does it seem fire is lacking dmg? but he is top dmg atm
[6:59:09] pharmztko: HUH
[6:59:20] Lancin1987: @honsou2 comparing garbage to garbage makes no sense
[6:59:42] orcrimmar: @Lancin1987 dk isn't garbage. wtf?
[6:59:58] twinbladeuk: This druid is actually owning
[7:00:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lobby grenade
[7:00:07] princesstoni01: the druid is lost
[7:00:13] Ultramagnus85: dk lowest win rate 2100+ in the last month
[7:00:20] wraithchill: of course the ret war wins lol
[7:00:23] dbdholland: 480 rating lock??
[7:01:01] Lancin1987: @orcrimmar Lol tell @honsou2 that
[7:01:01] honsou2: @orcrimmar l2p
[7:01:30] marvin1995xo: typical fire mage lobby go 0-6
[7:01:44] Badasti: @Smexxin I just don't think it's possible really. Most people will FOTM reroll anyway, even at 1400mmr. In my case I chose mage because I like the class and it was hard to learn, but it feels like I achieved more playing at 1800-2k than if I hopped on ret in S1 or DH now etc
[7:03:37] huo_junzhang: what is even your win con as a fire mage in this lobby
[7:04:18] Zenfuzz: lol
[7:04:26] Zenfuzz: gotta include the whole max range part
[7:05:02] psychic241: his win con is the same as everyone else's : High dampening
[7:05:25] chrye_xx: thats why i just dont like fire mage.. damage feels so meaningless idk how to even explain it
[7:05:26] Jun_bug__: I mean literally feels like your doingg 0 dam? but you arent
[7:05:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those treants pumping away and all the hots
[7:06:06] whspe: it feels bad to pyroblast the lock and his health goes up
[7:06:11] Ey_an: happens to us all
[7:06:15] ArdellanDH: happens
[7:06:22] Zlipps: priest still hasn't used pain sups
[7:06:25] Ultramagnus85: this happens to me everytime I get past 2200
[7:06:26] huo_junzhang: 40m que for a 0-6 lobby Despairge
[7:06:27] Zlipps: both charges
[7:06:30] Ultramagnus85: 0-6 1-5
[7:06:38] bllazzin: i see you rolled a nat 1 this q
[7:06:41] NozakGaming: Whats crazy is youre one of the best mages in the world. If I tried to play fire mage right now I would die in the opener. lol
[7:06:50] booba1421: @whspe well said 😅
[7:07:25] Ultramagnus85: big pumping
[7:08:14] healhut: druids just chill in broccoli form all game
[7:09:19] five_moke: believe it or not. the higher in rating you go with ur mage play it becomes a bit easier as the ppl you’re playing become better…. for the most part, ur still gonna get hot
[7:09:21] five_moke: hit
[7:09:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: A win!
[7:09:22] Taevenx: Nerf Ret
[7:09:24] Lancin1987: I feel like the lack of balance for healers in solo shuffle causes way more problems than anything else for solo shuffle
[7:09:27] mountaholic: yay!
[7:09:33] Ultramagnus85: nerf resto druids tho fr
[7:09:33] Itankarenas: -61 EZ
[7:09:33] vanncleff: -60 ouch
[7:09:35] huo_junzhang: fat rating for the lock
[7:09:36] Badasti: @five_moke thats true for healing as well i think
[7:09:37] draishu: nerf Fire, he won
[7:09:44] Jun_bug__: 67m dmg Crazy
[7:09:44] restosoup28: hansol so hot right now, hansol
[7:09:45] ArdellanDH: That enjoyment ?
[7:10:06] nameyourform: 1800 games are harder then my 2300 games
[7:10:09] varok87: Damn who is this Warlock
[7:10:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah for healers it gets easier at higher ratings because people use their defensive cooldowns
[7:10:24] healhut: show dispels in details?
[7:10:27] Taevenx: wait, what was the warlock healing?
[7:10:46] zachgamegodx: ladies and gentleman
[7:10:53] zachgamegodx: we have been live for 7 hours
[7:10:58] healhut: yeah thats rough
[7:11:21] Taevenx: I thought I saw 27mil healing
[7:11:55] Taevenx: and topped damage every round?
[7:12:02] justjoshingyo: healing is way too strong. just nerf it and keep dam
[7:12:04] justjoshingyo: p
[7:12:05] Badasti: how long has it been since Affliction was S tier? I remember when LSD was a thing back in the day and every game felt completely devoid of hope if you queued into it
[7:12:09] Taevenx: heck yeah
[7:12:16] Taevenx: casters own
[7:12:21] healhut: i did 30m healing in a blitz the other day as aff lol. soul leach is nutty
[7:12:27] Lugges48: i feel like ua should get a perma ms and tune affli arount it
[7:12:32] Jun_bug__: Tbh you can heal even more but you do less dam
[7:12:40] pharmztko: dewC
[7:12:43] Dakkoro: damn retail is ass damnit
[7:12:46] Izzythediscpriest: <3
[7:12:48] ellisrainy: have a good lift bro!

[7:13:10] Gajing: later sir, have a good one
[7:13:20] five_moke: well… it may seem easier in the sense that the players are better and have a better understanding of the game
[7:13:24] zachgamegodx: squeezin those   last second subs ppl
[7:13:28] five_moke: maybe not actually easier
[7:13:35] zachgamegodx: we need to get 60
