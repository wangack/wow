[3:09:12] dooshken: paladin, druid, and monk all have access to each role so one of those might be good to start. If you dont like healing, you can try other rolls easier
[3:10:00] dooshken: other roles*

[4:14:00] Devcomz: Anyone have not all the time but sometimes issues when you load into a shuffle the load screen doesnt go through. It makes you have to relog to get it to work from launcher but it makes it so you have to re queue. No rating loss though

[5:15:28] Devcomz: Am I allowed to link a big shuffle bug from the wow forums? That I posted that people should be wary of? Its been around since DDOS yesterday and it has affected me and others a few times
[5:15:39] Devcomz: Just wanted people to be aware of what is going on
[5:16:23] Devcomz: I did I went in full detail and even put a video link in the post  but it appears to be a frequent bug
[5:16:30] Devcomz: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/game-breaking-shuffle-bug-since-ddos-yesterday/1793572
[5:16:54] Devcomz: Just trying to help out
[5:17:15] Anhak: use the teleporter
[5:17:19] Anhak: o yea
[5:17:24] Anhak: you pull lever its kinda confusing
[5:17:38] Anhak: not while ur on it
[5:17:43] Anhak: u pull it to choose where it goes
[5:18:18] Devcomz: What happens is you will have a long loading screen or dc then it will put you in the place you queued at but it will show the name of the arena in the middle of your screen. There will be a Queue Icon that will be available that says the Shuffle is in progress in the arena but you will not be in there. After a certain amount of time it will go away but you will lose rating. Do not afk this or you will get a deserter debuff and lose even more rating.
[5:18:27] Devcomz: That is from the link ^
[5:19:04] Devcomz: here is the video of it hold on ill get the youtube link
[5:19:24] Devcomz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uUIMQO7WoM
[5:19:31] Devcomz: There is a video of it
[5:20:13] Devcomz: I tweeted the warcraft devs and put it in the bug report forums
[5:20:52] Anhak: na they are just tanking in a wierd spot
[5:22:23] sunileif: mes your completely opposed to DH correct?
[5:22:35] Anhak: UNIRONICLY
[5:22:42] Anhak: THAT SWORD is like pretty good for melee hunter now
[5:22:52] Anhak: cause they got normalized
[5:22:57] Anhak: well halfway normalized
[5:23:01] Devcomz: I just hope I was descriptive enough in reporting and that the video helps
[5:23:10] Anhak: are they actually fury?
[5:23:19] Anhak: dw war mostly play arms
[5:23:34] eMBeaR64oz: that rogue got epic dagger AND sword this raid
[5:23:35] eMBeaR64oz: !!
[5:24:56] sunileif: hmmm that just means kick the rogue
[5:25:04] sunileif: take a real class like hunter
[5:25:24] Anhak: play chimera shot

[5:25:52] Anhak: u can play chimera and any of the 3 specs as range hunter
[5:26:33] Anhak: which I think means cause they are legit all withing like 10 dps i think that technicly means MM is best since trueshot aura but i also just think play w.e you want thats why was asking about melee or not
[5:26:36] krome2dadome: 2 arcane mages
[5:27:02] Anhak: 1 uses healing runes 1 mage just dps and it stacks

[5:56:55] al_capow: and decoy the stacks
[5:57:45] al_capow: youll always end up with stacks, but if something messes up with the OT taunt while stacks run out, they can decoy them off
[6:01:56] Shablagoosh: did he finish the legendary chat
[6:02:03] al_capow: yea
[6:02:12] Shablagoosh: oh it wasnt 50 superblooms like that guy said?

[6:05:39] swiftkbr: 20 sec cd
[6:05:42] swiftkbr: or 10
[6:05:57] al_capow: yea and even after you have a stack it removes it
[6:06:00] al_capow: it's like a fap
[6:06:14] 99deece: its freedom
[6:06:16] al_capow: he has to replace alpha with it, but he should be able to hold threat
[6:06:19] swiftkbr: but then you dont have spirit of the alpha :/
[6:06:20] 99deece: for shaman
[6:07:40] al_capow: if he doesnt run decoy and you dont have an OT this is gonna be kinda rough
