[0:43:37] LordViken: You died on the last char?
[0:43:38] Drascho27: you can help him kill stuff just can't  join a party or ask for help
[0:43:45] LX2_EXE: Bro where the hell did that Worgen come from
[0:43:50] wagyu_88: did you see Summits death in Wailing Caversn hahaha
[0:44:14] BigFatRestoCow: It's a bit much.
[0:44:19] saizo: i like horde but lvling palcese is too sad ;/
[0:44:31] Knups: @wagyu_88 lol i saw that live. he was playing with a bunch of retail randys. they all started aoeing before he even touched one mob
[0:44:34] Eluneminati: Melee hunter? ;)
[0:44:37] BigFatRestoCow: Hunt phaor shore.
[0:44:39] wagyu_88: im 52 as Enh shaman
[0:44:46] Cowardpatty: Night Song = win
[0:44:55] jay_pegs: vanish can resist tho
[0:45:00] fliping21: you get vanish fairly late
[0:45:02] Infra_Roodborstje: I really hope there will be a good HC mode/addon in Retail
[0:45:11] Terminalbandoh: Where do you get the addon and register to play HC
[0:45:15] jay_pegs: imagine ur bouta hit 60 and ur vanish resists and ur dead lol
[0:45:18] wagyu_88: i just move real slow and do not dungeons lol
[0:45:20] startlord92: i will stay in the forest killing boars from 50-60
[0:45:26] Teagens: @Swifty If you wanna level Fast, Safe and make some good money while you are at it, make sure you do ALL THE STARTER ZONES and quests. For Forsaken and Orc/Trolls.
[0:45:29] fliping21: I hope they don't
[0:45:35] fliping21: Just hope they support the addon
[0:45:35] BigFatRestoCow: In south park they would just kill boars.
[0:45:42] BigFatRestoCow: Its the same IRL?
[0:45:45] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:45:52] wagyu_88: The problem with blizz HC is they wont do the appeals so ded is ded no matter how
[0:45:59] BigFatRestoCow: lol XD
[0:46:06] Eluneminati: Hopefully no trading. If AH is allowed, I hope that it auto-deletes any posts when a character dies and you're limited to how much you can put on there.
[0:46:09] Teagens: @Swifty Grey Quests still give EXP.
[0:46:16] UrsineTV: super greifing
[0:46:17] Eluneminati: Address griefers properly
[0:46:36] fliping21: are you in a specific guild or just a random one?
[0:46:40] jay_pegs: mitch jones cant even make it past 20 without getting griefed
[0:46:48] Djinx_o: Cool thing about HC right now is that everyone is equal when leveling
[0:46:49] jay_pegs: he got griefed at level 5 in the gnome starting zone by an orc rogue lol
[0:47:03] Knups: well ideally the entire realm will be HC with insta deletes on death....so hopefully ppl cant afford to grief
[0:47:13] crultivar: well im not playing hc again before blizzard gives out hc servers. wich will eliminate the griefing
[0:47:18] JuggaBugga: @jay_pegs i was watching him yesterday and he kept getting perma invited to groups by bots
[0:47:26] daltonlowe74: swifty is ur npc still in ashran
[0:47:44] BudSack: There will always be griefs of some sort
[0:47:52] arieltrindade91: I wish to see you playing druid in HC
[0:47:57] startlord92: if you get grieved its your own fault, you gotta be on the ball and ready to bounce if a greifer comes your way
[0:48:11] BigFatRestoCow: Hunters can grief on another level. It depends on what mob they can tame and if they can stay out of sight.
[0:48:24] NBK_Sethus: lmao
[0:48:27] Alloken: LUL
[0:48:33] Knups: gotta keep your head on a swivel in HC, which includes watching other players
[0:48:36] crultivar: ur to old for that zhit man!
[0:48:36] mysticnikkay: playing on HC is a lot different than regular wow classic has a pally  i get attack at least mobs with no worried of dying , But on HC you can do that ,i believe they have amped up the mobs on HC
[0:48:40] wagyu_88: Why cant you pvp on HC????? its not a pve death. so dumb
[0:48:45] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:48:55] mr_ocx: disable trades and AH
[0:49:05] stoney23b: yep
[0:49:16] BudSack: There is a pvp challenge for HC
[0:49:22] BigFatRestoCow: Yea. There was a am up date to the SOM build.
[0:49:24] blaise_pmk: What is season of mastery?
[0:49:44] startlord92: by the time blizz servers will come out everyone will be to burnt out
[0:49:50] jay_pegs: people are actually gonna push rank 14 in hc lol
[0:50:01] Cowardpatty: Season of Mastery was a good idea. It's just the amount of people it appealed to was small after most people already 'relived their nostalgia' in the first wave of classic.
[0:50:08] TonyTwoTokes: have you seen xaryu out there yet? hes leveling a tauren rn too
[0:50:09] wagyu_88: Why cant you pvp on HC????? its not a pve death. so dumb.

[0:51:15] PaulRay007: Hi @Swifty
[0:51:22] DanishLepRecon: What happend to swifty’s gamer room???
[0:51:27] BudSack: you could duo with a mage and do that now lol
[0:51:28] jnBuzzn: Swifty, that defeats the purpose of HC, just play a fresh server instead of HC
[0:51:32] Drascho27: I don't think the blizz version will be as popular
[0:51:35] daltonlowe74: i think we should be able to use the AH in hardcore
[0:51:40] MaybeCallMe: They are not going to have softcore queue with hardcore
[0:51:46] BigFatRestoCow: It looks like there could be an SOM2. There was a new build of SOM.
[0:51:54] jay_pegs: I personally dont agree with boosting in hardcore i feel like the whole point of it is to reexperience the game for the first time
[0:51:56] whitebeard999: why drops not working for me yet
[0:51:57] jnBuzzn: lmfao, i love your reasoning.
[0:52:02] blaise_pmk: How did you accept the quest instantly?
[0:52:26] BigFatRestoCow: HC Servers will no doubt be in SOM2.
[0:52:40] hir0k: BasedGod
[0:52:45] Alloken: Not AH but there should be trade among ppl taha are same level like +-3lvl
[0:52:50] blaise_pmk: I mean are you using an addon to accept quests instantly?
[0:52:51] daltonlowe74: do you think dungeon grinding should be aloud in HC offical servers
[0:52:55] jnBuzzn: som2 needs to hurry up, im ready to gank in STV
[0:52:55] Terminalbandoh: Argh pc crashed what is the name of the hc addon?
[0:52:57] wagyu_88: im sorry but not letting do BG's in HC is stupid.
[0:53:17] fliping21: for me what makes HC special is the rules. no AH, no dung Spam and no trading makes everything more special in the world
[0:53:17] daltonlowe74: an good size xp boost
[0:53:24] Niksen_99: World buffs
[0:53:30] Showbyz2: I want a global server
[0:53:30] NBK_Sethus: need a fresh classic not som

[0:53:44] BigFatRestoCow: Its a for gone conclusion now, with the popularity of HC mode. But people want to see classic WoW again.
[0:53:53] jnBuzzn: i wanna reach like 30-40 and just gank people on a fresh server
[0:53:57] Hyelander_: adding achievement that carry to retail
[0:53:57] SilkeySmooth: yes season of mastery 2 so i can pvp
[0:53:58] TheEndIsNear777: I'd like pvp gear Update with seasonal updates every phase too, like phase 2 pvp gear etc
[0:54:05] coconust1: I would love to have Vanilla plus, like all classes viable atleast

[0:54:29] Brotishko: Auction on blockchain and nft and airdrops
[0:54:39] wagyu_88: That would be possible.
[0:54:40] Drascho27: yes
[0:54:45] BigFatRestoCow: People have played old WoW for years. The appetite for classic wow is still there.
[0:54:45] julmasten: How do I convince my dou partner to go again after we died at 18?
[0:54:50] jnBuzzn: then youre playing retail :s
[0:54:56] Terminalbandoh: Dungeon plus. maybe
[0:54:56] linifox: id play classic iff vulpera
[0:55:05] TheBarnack: First SOM was so stupid with pvp ranking in phase 1, should go lose time in MC get rank and get that AQ gear right away
[0:55:07] lethalstick: hc but  u can turn pvp on only once on at lvl 60 so there would be like hc road to rank 14
[0:55:21] coconust1: Just making all classes viable would be nice
[0:55:22] daltonlowe74: what % xp boost would u think would be good
[0:55:37] SebbePwnYou: i hope they add the new profession system to classic :)
[0:55:41] fliping21: 1.5
[0:55:44] Showbyz2: just make 1 big server please blizzard
[0:55:47] Cowardpatty: LOL
[0:55:54] TheEndIsNear777: I'd like a HC pvp at 60 only but if you die in PVE or raids you delete so like you can grind to rank 14 while raiding MC and BWL
[0:55:57] Terminalbandoh: Ye war mode is off in the world till you level 60
[0:56:01] BigFatRestoCow: People asking for WoW Classic 2.0, that game is already out, its called TBC.
[0:56:01] jnBuzzn: thats a private server
[0:56:03] fliping21: then its just retail again
[0:56:05] fliping21: lmao
[0:56:07] SilkeySmooth: faster leveling please
[0:56:14] coconust1: 100x xp lol
[0:56:19] dakken89: just make it insta 60 then lol
[0:56:28] fliping21: 1.5x I think would be good
[0:56:30] Teagens: You got dis Swift!
[0:56:36] wagyu_88: maybe x5 XP
[0:56:37] jnBuzzn: classic leveling is great imo, maybe im just an old wow fart tho
[0:56:38] SilkeySmooth: if you want slow leveling play hardcore classic wow
[0:56:40] darktiger117: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:56:44] OMGitsDIRTY223: PvP always on with same faction pvp swiftySTARE
[0:56:58] Terminalbandoh: Also tbh more coverage. Like give people gear like m+ and do speed runs in raids etc just for the lols
[0:57:04] x_cX_x: i want group tagging of quest mobs. no lines needed
[0:57:07] Showbyz2: whats the point of fast leveling if everyone wuits at lvl 60
[0:57:11] daltonlowe74: i dont think people wanna put in the 200+ hrs to hit 60 anymore
[0:57:27] TheEndIsNear777: D:
[0:57:28] LX2_EXE: bro lol
[0:57:36] UrsineTV: oof thats a nice social lol
[0:57:45] SilkeySmooth: nor like this
[0:57:46] jnBuzzn: i think they need to bring back game masters, before they really try to implement anything crazy to be honest.
[0:57:48] SilkeySmooth: not
[0:57:52] TheBarnack: First SOM was so stupid with pvp ranking in phase 1, should go waste time in MC or rank and get that AQ gear right away

[1:00:12] TerenceMaurel: Hi Swifty ! How are u doing ? :)   I was the max level in HC mode ?
[1:00:15] beartotem: I think very easy to do HC with a warlock

[1:01:54] Djinx_o: Guess you can just leave BG if you're about to die
[1:01:56] Teagens: @beartotem Hopefully never xD

[1:03:52] CoachALG: waiting for you to come out of stealth
[1:03:55] jnBuzzn: i doubt the HC community will actually pvp. its would be a single server battlegroup. prolly 2 hour queues, EVEN as horde
[1:03:59] alantin77: do hunters not have Flare in classic?
[1:04:24] murky_dirk: the stream snipers will find u
[1:04:26] Djinx_o: Blizz would probably nerf honor in stealth/ out of combat :/
[1:04:27] beartotem: The way they had HC is SoM season 1 was completely stupid
[1:04:27] TheBarnack: Looks like its gonna be alot of waiting

[1:08:44] raffles187: So jut 40 rogues in stealth not killing each other?
[1:08:45] jnBuzzn: IF, and this is a strong IF, if you can get a queue on a single server pve, HC SERVER at that... Youre gonna join a WSG with 5 people each side, and its gonna end in 90 seconds.

[1:09:50] DyeAgonal: I think it'll be tough to rack up enough HKs if its a fully HC server as every 60 you kill or that dies in a BG will be starting over. Right?
[1:09:53] jnBuzzn: @darktiger117 now were talkin
[1:09:55] murky_dirk: its possible with Peanuts help

[1:11:01] wagyu_88: damn
[1:11:07] raffles187: Doing a retail bg and hitting classic r14 without dying are two slightly different things lol
[1:11:10] darktiger117: @jnBuzzn rightttttt how fun would it be to have a camping ablility, have fire to make you warm, remove armour in hot zones or put on more warm clothes in cold zones
[1:11:11] jnBuzzn: just hamstring, reset the swing
[1:11:15] starlikewoop: Stun your opponent and yourself :D
[1:11:29] Teagens: I wonder what the Item Level of Mythic+ gear is going to be tomorrow

[1:11:47] Teagens: I have to regear my Warrior all over again for Raids/Mythic+  x_x

[1:12:38] The_Sizzlac: @Nefferion more stamina
[1:12:52] one_bucket: If you make HC super easy yes
[1:12:59] jnBuzzn: @darktiger117 i mean you can make your own challenges. I love roleplaying to that degree, honestly.
[1:13:07] ryanblue98: have to put a 30 second stream delay and always be on the move in pvp
[1:13:15] one_bucket: Most can’t even get a 60 hc
[1:13:19] jnBuzzn: @darktiger117 som2 BETTER have a rppvp server or i aint even playin
[1:13:35] Cowardpatty: It's possible. However, it's improbable to the point that it is effectively impossible.
[1:13:35] raffles187: It’s possible but it’s a million to one.
[1:13:50] freddy_fazbearrr: steamers and speed runners will get targeted if blizz does hc servers

[6:20:54] Mecabeast: the weekly quest to do 5 heroic dungeons can give you either 1 drake crest of a 415 gear piece
[6:21:11] Mecabeast: or*
[6:21:25] xmedpakx: the heroic quests gives one and a 415 upgradable
[6:21:42] GarbaggioAdaggio: Drake crest is most certainly not needed. Its the Trophy of Conquest you need
[6:21:52] GarbaggioAdaggio: and spark shadowflame ya
[6:22:10] TwizzCD: The Crests are used at the Item Upgrade guy
[6:22:35] Somfas: click on the splinters
[6:22:36] t3fl0nd0n89: Upgrade dude in Loamm
[6:22:44] Somfas: 2 splinters make the spark
[6:22:51] xmedpakx: any upgrade vendor
[6:22:55] TwizzCD: At the "Item upgrade" guy in the cave town
[6:23:00] Somfas: in bags?
[6:23:18] james21: there in the new zone
[6:23:22] xmedpakx: lol did not read any quests
[6:23:42] xmedpakx: yes the upgrade vendor
[6:23:45] james21: in the new zone
[6:23:49] TwizzCD: The crests and Flightstones are used there to upgrade gear
[6:24:15] Vendralos: You can do it there too
[6:24:31] xmedpakx: any upgrade vendor you where just there
[6:24:32] Somfas: is this for your first 450?
[6:24:35] xmedpakx: :(
[6:24:39] SilkeySmooth: it to confusing
[6:24:47] SilkeySmooth: i didnt do any of the pve
[6:24:53] xmedpakx: it is not confusing lol
[6:25:03] Vendralos: You can
[6:25:13] MikeSpoonz: There’s a quest in the new zone that gives you 2 splinters, create the thing by clicking on the 2, use the trophy and crest should give you the 450 crafted pvp gear
[6:25:15] emwonrc: You can upgrade season 2 gear that you got this week with the flightstones and crests
[6:25:22] MikeSpoonz: The flight stones are mostly used for pave gear right chat?
[6:25:27] Somfas: is this you first 450?
[6:25:31] MikeSpoonz: Pve*
[6:25:34] Vendralos: I've been upgrading my stuff
[6:25:36] SilkeySmooth: if i didnt do any of the pve can i use the catalyst to upgrade pvp gear?
[6:25:36] warmishspace: lol what happened to blizz saying they wont do convoluted systems :/
[6:25:53] xmedpakx: oh he did not do the quests
[6:25:55] Somfas: type splinter
[6:25:55] GarbaggioAdaggio: Chat is simply dead wrong. You cant use Drake Crests on any item and they do not upgrade to 450
[6:25:55] xmedpakx: omg
[6:25:58] DragonReb0rn: Swifty
[6:26:00] xmedpakx: my bad bro
[6:26:00] MikeSpoonz: Yeah the spark of shadow flame and the trophy
[6:26:08] james21: you want coords?
[6:26:11] Somfas: type splinter in bag search
[6:26:16] DragonReb0rn: you need to unlock the new upgrade vendor stuff with the quest
[6:26:16] GarbaggioAdaggio: you use Trophy of Conquest and Spark of Shadowflame to craft a 450 Pvp piece
[6:26:20] Vendralos: This system isn't super hard to figure out after a while to be fair.
[6:26:20] Juicewisdom: axeumSip
[6:26:21] SilkeySmooth: i didnt do any of the pve so i cant upgrade pvp gear?
[6:26:26] Somfas: open bags type splinter in search
[6:26:26] xmedpakx: you do need to do the new upgrade tutorial stuff

[6:27:34] SilkeySmooth: i just want to upgrade my pvp gear
[6:27:35] diamura: we going back to classic afterwards or staying on retail
[6:27:42] MikeSpoonz: No the upgrades are for pve explorers gear, it does upgrade to a decent ilvl tho, especially the good gear but it might be the wrong stats so dunno if it’s worth it, other than the crafted, pvp players are in the clear from all this
[6:27:44] xmedpakx: i understand but its gated behind pve
[6:28:09] SilkeySmooth: flightstones for pvp gear thats dumb
[6:28:10] razthemun: you will get a quest later telling you to upgrade
[6:28:23] Gaudzauw: It will show up in the crafting window when youre making / upgrading an item
[6:28:33] Vendralos: seems like a crafted item
[6:28:34] SilkeySmooth: im not playing season 2 then its to complitated

[6:29:10] MikeSpoonz: The lady is outside of loamm
[6:29:12] GarbaggioAdaggio: Chat you literally dont have to do any Pve if you dont want. U can farm Conq doing just pvp and buy all 450 gear
[6:29:14] Vendralos: Gotta get someone to craft the item for you with the sparks I believe
[6:29:21] GarbaggioAdaggio: so not rly gated
[6:29:35] MikeSpoonz: Yeh

[6:29:39] Vendralos: yes

[6:33:42] xmedpakx: save that spark
[6:33:51] xmedpakx: new gear soon
[6:34:11] MikeSpoonz: Okay, so the 2 splintered spark of shadow flame (that get combined to a single spark to be used with the trophy) is given to you from the quest called “Power Unified” It is a blood elf nod outside the big building in loam called “Examiner Tae’Shara Bloodwatcher” you can also grind splinters but who the heck wants to do that in week one
[6:34:24] Gaudzauw: I wonder if you can recraft a weapon with the 450pvp ilvl
[6:34:55] MikeSpoonz: Oh wait you have one
[6:35:19] UrsineTV: weeeee just got griefed in HC
