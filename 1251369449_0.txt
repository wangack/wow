[2:17:26] stenlaketv: its a wep buff
[2:17:27] holymonke: other way around
[2:17:28] BrandoBaggins1: you do windfury first since it lasts 9 seconds then drop grace of air until windfury needs a refresh
[2:17:30] stenlaketv: LOL

[2:18:17] GreatValueLewisHamilton: MJ is kind of a jerk though
[2:18:19] shamscam: @Swifty okay so the idea is you want to drop windury every 8 seconds and then drop grace of for those 8 seconds in-between drops
[2:18:20] riplin28: Drop WF then immediately drop Grace, wait 9 seconds, do it again

[9:53:48] mr_ocx: you guys are making the oposing team gameplay worst
[9:53:55] mr_ocx: just my opinion though
[9:54:20] shoc9524: its not fun to que into game after game, and being crushed like that... i get it, it encourages being more social and stuff, but still too unfair for ppl to not do
[9:54:25] litreofcola21: seems not tos
[9:54:34] willsilvey: Who would win in a 1v1 Swifty or Peanut?
[9:54:57] neevir: 5 min deserter would be enough to kill premades

[9:55:07] warriorlord8: me if i got the charge ;P
[9:55:11] sl0thdc: find some people to queue with
[9:55:22] lajzk: u should ask blizzard to make a unraked queue and a ranked one, swifty or any other streamer / premade cant do anything about that, imagine playing 13 hours a day, u need to make it smooth

[12:08:18] thayornshaman: Hello Swifty! whats up with r14 still going??
[12:08:24] viperagenx: u need someone to manage your YT and do those things
[12:08:25] TheFrageN: It's almost like the biggest companies, act like the biggest weirdos
[12:08:25] Mamagos: Basically like getting a fine, pay up, then fight it. sounds stupid
[12:08:25] Oblongship: I feel that. I have a channel with nearly 300k subs and for 99% of the videos epedemic is fine, but sometimes you go through a patch of it demonetizing every freakin video. It's super annoying
[12:08:25] thebrownbear: crazy i was 12 years old now im 23 years old in the army and still a huge fan
[12:08:38] Reinswood: @Swifty not even vlog videos?
[12:08:47] Oblongship: Not only do you lose rev, but YT won't push the video as much
[12:08:48] zaddyz34: When you gonna play some MM hunter on retail again ? 🔥
[12:08:54] realDonPanini: DMCA is literally from 1998, it makes no sense how its still being used today.

[12:09:27] Cornflex180: @Swifty youtube, and twitch only geting worse and more sensitive

[12:10:01] Kiexi: No penalty for false claims
[12:10:13] Oblongship: I don't know why but YT has been doing that a lot recently. I get random copyrights/age restrictions randomly from videos 2 years old that no one watches
[12:10:22] voidcall1: so wait if your video gets demonetized, the company that issued it gets ur revenue ?

[12:12:06] defiant995: ngl i really miss the IRL streams you did years ago
[12:12:07] realDonPanini: there's actual companies that copyright strike videos for the copyright holders without them even asking to do it and then they ask a percentage of the reveneu claimed
[12:12:13] Oblongship: @Swifty If you ever need help or want to chat about YT etc let me know and we can chat off stream

[12:12:48] kim_da_fin: @swifty have you changed honor spy to show SoM calculations?

[12:14:38] Ascendor81: When you upload a YT video, let it sit there unlisted for 1 hour, and let YT pick up any flags, then you can cut out the parts, re-upload, before you make it public
[12:14:44] Kiexi: So if two parties claim a single video, what happens?
[12:14:49] Mikey1479: @Kim_Da_Fim is that a thing you need to do?
[12:14:49] jellyfish_boy: Even if its an hour long video, just because there is a 10 second sound bite they get all the revenue
[12:14:51] jellyfish_boy: That sucks
[12:14:55] Abroren: I snippet of a video with a song in it makes that entire video the intellectual property of the company with the rights to the song. Ridiculous.
[12:14:57] Winfire82: is classic wow dead?
[12:15:02] aviduser2: all your revenue belongs to us
[12:15:04] kredes_: its actually insane its close to impossible to hit rank 14 for regular players

[12:15:13] Hatsimale: swifty why do you always look so young whats your secret
[12:15:15] Oblongship: tbh it should be a percentage share on revenue if anything. They can calculate AVD %'s etc. If it is 2% of the video, they should get 2% of the rev
