[1:31:34] razaael: Hey guys what do you think of Prot warrior right now? good? is it good for raids m+?
[1:32:16] Kinghorn: love how 6 people is too much melee
[1:32:30] Hoothor: @razaael Its unfortunately the weakest of all the tanks right now. Its niche is physical damage, but there are very few fights where physical damage is a big issue enough for it to matter.
[1:32:31] Kinghorn: or is it 8
[1:32:48] Hoothor: Its real strength in M+ is the number of stuns they have, and that's about it.
[1:33:28] razaael: @Hoothor Like My main is a prot pala its its pretty good but i wanna have a tank alt but i dont like many tanks tbh
[1:33:36] Artivicii: 6 melee in 20 man is a lot, technically comes out to 8 with tanks
[1:34:01] SeleneVoelkerVT: ouch I feel that aphro
[1:34:12] Kinghorn: the night fae warrior ability is so good in M+
[1:34:13] Hoothor: I role a Venthyr Prot warrior, so I get a bit of extra niche being able to do heavy DMG with Condemn

[1:38:41] CritcobainTV: towPog
[1:39:49] Hoothor: @razaael DH is very strong rn. And a lot of fun to play imo.
