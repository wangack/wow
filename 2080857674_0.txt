[1:59:42] struci: In an unprecedented move, legal representatives of a Tesla shareholder, pivotal in invalidating Elon Musk's staggering 2018 compensation package, have petitioned the Delaware Chancery Court on Friday, March 1, for nearly $6 billion in legal fees, proposed to be settled in company shares. "The size of the requested award is great because the value of the benefit to Tesla that Plaintiff's Counsel achieved was massive," the firms said.
