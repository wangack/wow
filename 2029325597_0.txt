[0:58:27] daggerslife: but Ryan.. penance will also scale with levels itself
[0:59:00] cyanne112: from a pve pov nerfing mana is pointless since fights are so short.

[2:01:08] wouch88: it costs 4 mana KEKW

[3:16:46] Mystiggo: nerf barely changes anything for disc

[3:17:47] Banedroppa: the hunter whining about a very needed nerf is  lovely
[3:18:16] ToddVonWhy: I checked the subscriber-ui channel and couldn't find it. What addon do you use to get your party/raid frames so clean?

[3:19:02] Banedroppa: kekw
[3:19:05] Mystiggo: it's good that they're giving hunter a little more power on shots and taking it away from pet

[3:21:54] veil_dust: if*
[3:21:58] Mystiggo: it's random as shit

[4:00:48] Kiroxx: never had a fear resist, what u talking about
[4:01:01] HeyImArty: i could be completely wrong but im 100% convinced dispel resist didnt ever exist despite what they claimed
[4:01:01] Kiroxx: timestamp yesterday 01:49
[4:01:03] Kiroxx: xD
[4:01:05] HeyImArty: (friendly dispel)
[4:01:55] HeyImArty: is that a rare feral druid
[4:01:59] HeyImArty: Does he not know about starsurge
[4:02:01] Grabakh: welcome to the life of a pug player
[4:02:11] peeweeherman69: to busy trying to scramble another shitty pvp event together
[4:03:02] shrroom: we are getting nerfed tomorrow hydra BibleThump
[4:03:03] Mystiggo: out of all the "always been" bugs to "fix" rofl
[4:03:16] jarlo123: !phase2
[4:03:16] Nightbot: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24053283/this-week-in-wow-8-january-2024
[4:03:21] peeweeherman69: the fact they added passive dmg reduce in bgs is trash its already slow af
[4:03:30] jarlo123: @Hydramist u think balance druids will be good in phase 2 like they are now?
[4:03:51] Mystiggo: I don't understand where they come up with these ideas like -dmg in wsg
[4:03:54] Mystiggo: like who asked for that?
[4:04:01] Mystiggo: everybody wants to pump
[4:04:19] HeyImArty: Btw how much you streaming this weekend? got lots of uni work to do & SoD is peak background content
[4:04:26] Kiroxx: too bursty, cry cry, not rock paper scissors cry cry. they dont play there own game
[4:04:30] Kiroxx: maybe thats why.
[4:05:36] HeyImArty: on the topic of changes, PoM bouncing of heals is such a nice change tho
[4:05:57] middlezzz: hello do u have playlist link?
[4:06:07] HeyImArty: they buffed the event to 1k/week right
[4:06:11] Kiroxx: you dont win as horde, so no
[4:06:24] Kiroxx: attack boss, run to next, then u get 800rep and its fine
[4:06:25] wooraah: you still get rep afk if your team wins
[4:06:30] Mystiggo: but best to set HS to splintertree and do the whole boss tagging thing
[4:06:30] wooraah: but much more if active
[4:06:34] Kiroxx: with ally on LF i get like 1,5-2k
[4:06:40] bassiemon123: Can do weekly if u havent
[4:06:58] Kiroxx: rank3 vs wsg cloak? close right?
[4:07:02] Kiroxx: for priest
[4:07:49] HeyImArty: this is the issue with premades, 0 enjoyment
[4:07:55] Kiroxx: but ! ashenvale is nice with patch, its every 2h10min roughly so u cant miss any if needed
[4:08:14] HeyImArty: R1 mind vision in WSG is depressing
[4:08:15] Kiroxx: 2h10min AFTER last event ended i might add
[4:09:18] Mystiggo: bloodsail buccaneers Kappa
[4:09:20] HeyImArty: AB is probably on-par because games tend to be slower
[4:09:28] wooraah: Wintersabers lol?
[4:09:29] Kiroxx: nope, keepers of time maybe :D haha, but no, wsg it is, cuz i has no end, AB has end.
[4:10:01] peeweeherman69: wsg is the worst imagine grinding wsg all day and getting 0 rep LUL
[4:10:01] Kiroxx: the wsg problem is the potential endless matches
[4:10:44] mlinuxgada: hey @Hydramist whats our op on spriest on phase 2 Wow SOD ?
[4:11:13] mlinuxgada: whats your oppinion
[4:11:15] Distorpia: he's asking u to look into the future and give us a prophecy xd
[4:11:15] mlinuxgada: sry
[4:11:30] peeweeherman69: same as always, tanky mongo class
[4:11:34] peeweeherman69: LUL
[4:12:01] mlinuxgada: I wanna roll one, but atm spriest is kinda weak... too weak, but I guess in next phase its gonna be ok
[4:12:03] Larr_y_: what was that warlock doing lol
[4:13:08] Larr_y_: big rolls on kelris snagged gaze leggins and signet of twilight lord
[4:13:23] AleGfi: having the BFD wand at 25 feels like cheating
[4:14:15] Larr_y_: why aernt these locks fearing
[4:20:51] Extramediums: they have beem
[4:20:55] Extramediums: and it gets willed
[4:21:17] Extramediums: resisted, or they're at 50% by the time they go for the next fear
[4:23:10] piouspectre: feels sooo good at 1.2
[4:23:23] MachoGG: what addon tracks enemy buffs
[4:23:47] Mystiggo: add a .8 speed machine gun wand to gnomeregan
[4:24:16] Mystiggo: that shoots out nuts and bolts, dealing physical dmg
[4:26:38] MachoGG: sorry did u answer? got a phone call
[4:26:48] AleGfi: @Hydramist are you going to be stacking WSG marks on 8th of Feb? Heard they give 1200xp per turnin
[4:28:11] Mystiggo: would be kinda cool because a phys dmg wand would benefit from homunc too
[4:28:21] AleGfi: I dont know about any mail restrictions
[4:28:29] AleGfi: But if there are no restricitions it will be mad
[4:28:46] AleGfi: But as a real  good premade you can stack so many in 24h
[4:28:53] AleGfi: get you to like lvl 30 maybe even
[4:30:15] raags_: only Randys save tokens
[4:31:08] ImAmZiro: Hello :) Why do you prefer dwarf over ne as a priest?
[4:31:30] tyneetym: Fear Ward -)
[4:31:44] ImAmZiro: Thank you
[4:32:16] AleGfi: tiers would quite heavily change depending if you PvE/PvP and play shadow or disc
[4:33:09] AleGfi: nah fuck pve content
[4:33:12] AleGfi: there is enough of that
[4:33:20] AleGfi: good pvp content is scarce

[4:39:36] vrsswow: Sup bro... evening ladys and gents

[4:55:07] Mystiggo: just remove the conditional on one
[4:55:29] Mystiggo: gotcha
[4:55:36] tyneetym: Ineed to learn that macro way
[4:56:23] Mystiggo: I just resorted to specifying the #showtooltip so it defaults to one
[4:56:30] Mystiggo: but this will make my macroes just a little bit neater
[4:58:29] JimpaEU: what spec are you running?

[5:07:34] Kiroxx: so..5/6 chars now pearl.. fk that :D lets go
[5:07:52] yaaksha: Tbh, never done a BFD with 2 Priests
[5:08:05] Snurn: But let's say that there are two serpent stings on the boss and one of them runs out. How do you know if it's "yours"? I guess you could look for damage ticks from serpent sting
[5:08:10] vrsswow: Drum'n Bass
[5:08:33] bassiemon123: Its getting better and better
[5:09:04] vrsswow: Randle is like Alice in Wonderland

[5:14:58] Larr_y_: honestly annoys me so much lol
[5:15:18] Snurn: New to priest here. Is Renew the most mana efficient heal after Penance?
[5:15:44] poiskd: in later phases r2 Heal is gonna be your most mana efficient
[5:15:45] Snurn: and what are the numbers at the bottom of the spell icons?
[5:15:56] poiskd: renews fairly efficient but not the best
[5:16:11] Snurn: @poiskd but I'm talking what's the most mana efficient right now in phase 1
[5:16:29] poiskd: pom/penance > Heal > Renew > Flash
[5:16:30] Mystiggo: Renew is not very efficient especially since it overheals a lot of the time. I still use it because it's easy
[5:16:41] poiskd: for 25 cap
[5:16:54] Mystiggo: Just chug a renew on someone and carry on deepsing
[5:16:59] poiskd: in terms of pure "healing per mana" efficiency
[5:17:36] DrJaves: Other priest running PoM or naw? @Hydramist
[5:17:38] poistay: what do you think of the healing nerf? does it feel like alot

[5:17:56] SwAtCaT_: Renew is for warlock spamming life tap all day long
[5:18:35] Mystiggo: Warlocks have fully trained me to always press renew on lock after every pull no matter what
[5:18:42] Mystiggo: to the point where it now triggers me if they don't tap with it
[5:18:44] Mystiggo: and just sit at half mana
[5:19:30] SwAtCaT_: same

[5:21:15] Kataemoi: nerf to priest!!
[5:21:19] Kataemoi: 20%
[5:21:22] tyneetym: The ring is not unique either, I do not know if the ring stacks with another ring though
[5:21:39] vrsswow: @tyneetym Ty mate for info - got the ring :)
[5:22:40] Snurn: What do you call that weakaura that shows the five second rule on mana bar?
[5:23:35] don_ben_yo: Is there a Class, which gives Caster Bonus Damage atm. ?

[5:24:52] vrsswow: swim ring its unique
[5:25:13] Mystiggo: warlocks have some curses later on. curse of shadows and curse of elements
[5:25:15] vrsswow: cant have 2
[5:25:17] Mystiggo: that's about it I think
[5:25:20] shrroom: my priest just got epic staff <3
[5:25:58] Mystiggo: which doesn't give bonus spell dmg but same thing essentially
[5:25:59] yaaksha: @don_ben_yo Yes, Warlocks gives a +13 Spell Power buff but nobody is running it because you have to give up Everlasting Affliction or Incinerate
[5:26:27] Mystiggo: ohh
[5:26:37] Mystiggo: didn't even know that was a thing... for the mentioned reasons
[5:26:38] don_ben_yo: Ah, okay. Thanks @yaaksha
[5:26:54] yaaksha: Arj is going to try and run it next BFD so we can smash some parses
[5:27:53] tyneetym: Your pet's critical strikes apply the Demonic Pact effect to your party members for 45 sec. Demonic Pact increases spell damage and healing by 10% of your spell damage or (Level / 2), whichever is higher. Does not work on Subjugated demons. is possible, at the cost of everlasting
[5:28:47] yaaksha: lol
[5:28:49] shrroom: I was pretty much solo healing yeah, born into this you know LUL

[5:34:16] yaaksha: true
[5:34:18] DommoUk: cause we didn't int
[5:34:59] tyneetym: Every raid group this week has had a Randle in it
[5:35:03] Rayman_1990: so, troll is stronker than undead ?
[5:35:16] fuleir4: @Hydramist ive just seen the nerf to priests. what is your take? any change in build or runes?
[5:35:22] yaaksha: Yes 100% @Rayman_1990 you should remake as Troll
[5:35:31] tyneetym: @Rayman_1990 for PVE, maybe
[5:35:33] yaaksha: I'm levelling a Troll Warr as we speak
[5:35:47] Mystiggo: troll and UD both decent, human leagues above both however
[5:35:49] yaaksha: Don't listen to him, Trolls are the superior race
[5:36:00] Mystiggo: human male to be more specific
[5:36:08] yaaksha: ??? how you gonna talk about Humans and not Dwarves @Mystiggo
[5:36:20] Mystiggo: what's a dwarf?
[5:36:28] tyneetym: get that 15 silver
[5:37:10] Mystiggo: let me ask you this... how come Ryan has a human and not a dwarf?
[5:39:25] Mystiggo: holy he's dying slowly
[5:39:33] Mystiggo: dust 2 dust angle...?
[5:40:07] Mystiggo: yes....
[5:41:11] Herodarki: –¥live game
[5:42:18] tyneetym: You have 60% of the mana you have on your other priest lol
[5:42:37] bomzzwtf: whatsup gamers
[5:43:16] bomzzwtf: What happened you all dedged?
[5:43:21] Rayman_1990: priest haters claimed that prenerf penance healed ppl to full in 1 cast, meanwhile it healed for like 550 iirc. How come blizz listened to them
[5:44:20] Mystiggo: penance nerf was warranted. I just hope it doesn't feel like a wet noodle at 40 with MS
[5:44:53] bomzzwtf: So they nerfed all rune healing by 20%?
[5:45:33] bomzzwtf: circle nerf is a bit weird ;o
[5:47:07] tyneetym: Circle was so meh to start
[5:47:17] Rayman_1990: hmm, I think ure not supposed to take so much dmg in his phase 1, all dmg is kickable
[5:47:22] Mystiggo: well circle is a pve talent
[5:47:35] Mystiggo: it absolutely pumps on turtle boss for example
[5:47:47] bomzzwtf: yea so nerf regrowth too
[5:47:47] fuleir4: no kicks in p1 is wrecking your group
[5:47:54] bomzzwtf: arent they the same
[5:48:09] Mystiggo: kinda but the thing is you can have both pom and circle
[5:48:19] Mystiggo: if there's more aoe damage in gnomer
[5:48:23] Mystiggo: priest would be giga op
[5:49:02] bomzzwtf: Just like any raid with gear
[5:49:04] Mystiggo: yea for sure
[5:49:08] yaaksha: And they buffed a couple of classes
[5:49:13] bomzzwtf: but we gear so fast cuz of the 3 daylockout
[5:49:20] bomzzwtf: They nerfed bfd as well
[5:49:46] tyneetym: My rogue has done 3 raids, and the only item he has won for loot in all three raids is the pearl =(
[5:50:13] bomzzwtf: is mokahunts naked?
[5:50:16] bomzzwtf: looks like a naked orc :D
[5:50:23] Herodarki: trash loot
[5:50:40] Rayman_1990: meanwhile I havent seen a single drop of any sword in our static FrankerZ
[5:50:41] bomzzwtf: from durator
[5:50:42] Khodaya: yo hydra what playlist is this?
[5:50:59] poiskd: @tyneetym Yeah bfds cursed. Priest was first 25 raided week1 and still rockin robes of arugal and deadmines staff, meanwhile BIS mage and paladin alt lmfao
[5:51:10] yaaksha: Druids lose 30% damage if they take kick
[5:51:28] yeahboimp4s: 2 shaman should be fine for interrupts
[5:51:29] yaaksha: Can only really kick as Bear
[5:51:31] bomzzwtf: yea u never take kick on druid
[5:51:38] Rayman_1990: with 2 shamans he shouldnt be able to do any dmg at all in phase 1
[5:51:59] tyneetym: @poiskd My Warrior is geared except Ineed 2 handed sword and one other item.... everything else has gotten nothing
[5:52:30] tyneetym: Druid has done three raids as well and all I get in his raids is Caster Gear, Rogue gets all the mail gear, Priest gets all the DPS leather
[5:52:33] bomzzwtf: very low dps thats why u run out of room
[5:53:25] yaaksha: Yes
[5:53:25] Mystiggo: yea
[5:53:27] yaaksha: Closest
[5:53:30] Lumann: 2nd on threat
[5:53:32] yaaksha: 2nd on threat = BITE ON TURTLE
[5:54:37] bomzzwtf: its randle and friends group :D
[5:54:59] Rayman_1990: @mikimano3500 incredible 5man tank thats for sure
[5:55:04] yaaksha: Bro it's the last boss who does 2nd threat bite lmao, my bad
[5:55:05] tyneetym: have the warlock summon everyone and hearth to get boon lol
[5:55:51] bomzzwtf: I mean hunters couldnt get so nerfed to do 70 dps :D
[5:56:10] yaaksha: LOL
[5:56:36] Mystiggo: my hunter did 140 dps on kelris the first run I ever did in full AH greens /shrug
[5:56:38] Mystiggo: and I'm clueless
[5:56:39] Arjibhaji: Lost my WB since Raj was screaming about turtle bites
[5:56:42] Mystiggo: just sent my pet in and multishot on cd
[5:56:51] bomzzwtf: i think its naked orcs :D
[5:56:52] Arjibhaji: Taunted and got chomped
[5:57:07] bomzzwtf: straight outta durator
[5:57:41] tyneetym: Mokahunts is basically doing nothing?
[5:58:14] bomzzwtf: I mean i've been playing chimera shot flanking for weeks now, so i got kinda buffed
[5:58:36] zeuthenx: can't beat priests as warlock :o is there a way to do it? Drain amna?
[5:58:38] zeuthenx: mana*
[5:58:45] bomzzwtf: flanking was always good
[5:58:45] Mystiggo: you melee weave with flanking
[5:58:52] Arjibhaji: Flanking was good after the AP scaling was added
[5:58:52] bomzzwtf: As long as u have a thicc 2h
[5:59:00] Arjibhaji: It does damage in 2 parts on meters so it looks sus
[5:59:07] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[5:59:09] bomzzwtf: 350 crits
[5:59:23] vmttmv: flanking's okay but the rng mechanic on it is kinda ass
[5:59:34] bomzzwtf: Your group skipped WC and went bfd
[5:59:35] yaaksha: Savage Roar
[5:59:38] yaaksha: 30% dmg
[5:59:42] tyneetym: Yes
[5:59:43] yaaksha: We have no finisher atm
[5:59:45] bomzzwtf: savage roar is what makes them viable
[5:59:50] Stemu: insane diff
[5:59:58] tyneetym: Feral Druid should be 2 buttons, Mangle / Savage Roar lol
[6:00:03] tyneetym: Top the charts
[6:00:07] Mystiggo: oh we have a bear pet
[6:00:11] yaaksha: Like imagine a Rogue not taking Slice & Dice, if Evis wasn't in the game
[6:00:13] Mystiggo: that's sus
[6:00:24] yaaksha: Wind Serpent is still good
[6:00:31] Mystiggo: wind serpent with flanking, cat with kill command innit
[6:00:36] Bloch29: I just did a bfd (non-gdkp) and I got gloves, pearl and epic staff on my shadow priest :D
[6:00:38] vmttmv: ws prolly because you can still do 2x lb for burst
[6:00:45] bomzzwtf: Well wind serpent was bis before they removed its bonus damage from killcommand
[6:00:51] zeuthenx: no more lightning breath spam? :D
[6:00:55] Bloch29: tyty^^
[6:00:58] Mystiggo: I think both are viable
[6:01:07] Mystiggo: but I'd imagine the focus regen nerf hurts wind serpent more
[6:01:08] bomzzwtf: But now u play mm
[6:01:09] Mapton30: What the hell is shadow priest lol
[6:01:22] tyneetym: Look at Monkahunts gear? is looks nekid af
[6:01:29] bomzzwtf: @tyneetym thats what i said xddd
[6:01:37] bomzzwtf: cloak from starting zone
[6:02:29] tyneetym: Probably has level 7 whites, like Tribal Bracers lol
[6:02:31] Mystiggo: that looks an awful lot like the epic xbow tho, no? Kappa
[6:02:45] bomzzwtf: nah epic is brown i think
[6:02:58] bomzzwtf: maybe thisis the steel one
[6:03:03] Mixedcolors: get any gear this run yet bro?
[6:03:08] Mystiggo: idk they all look the same for me
[6:03:14] Mystiggo: horrible models those xbows
[6:03:29] bomzzwtf: bring karazhan bow :D
[6:03:40] Mystiggo: there's some cool xbows at 60 tho iirc
[6:04:17] bomzzwtf: epic staff drops after 5 wipes
[6:04:29] Mystiggo: no shot
[6:04:36] Bloch29: hjahahaha
[6:04:39] Bloch29: welp
[6:04:39] Drunk_Mantis: omg lol
[6:04:40] Mystiggo: that is pain
[6:04:41] yaaksha: That Blood Fury cucked the group
[6:04:43] itsBughyboyz: ahahahaha

[6:04:46] Mixedcolors: yikes lol
[6:04:47] Drunk_Mantis: the bloodfury literalyl cost yhou all the kill lol
[6:04:47] bomzzwtf: progressing
[6:04:48] Bloch29: we wiped at 60hp
[6:04:49] Speanktbc: AHAHHH theres noway?
[6:04:50] Mapton30: Maybe with homunculi u would have enough dmg xDDD
[6:04:55] enjoyinftw: is this classic sod progression?
[6:04:55] tyneetym: less than 150 health lol
[6:04:56] Zalelol: smh priests not wanding enough
[6:05:09] bomzzwtf: can you inspect mopkahunts for us
[6:05:11] bomzzwtf: we are all curious
[6:05:26] tyneetym: Yes! inspect mokahunts
[6:05:31] Rayman_1990: main problem is they dont interrupt and make healers spend too much mana in phase 1
[6:05:31] enjoyinftw: he got send to the after life Kappa
[6:05:41] Stemu: aaah this is reminding me how it was the very first resets before nerf and bad gear
[6:05:54] Stemu: was fun
[6:06:41] enjoyinftw: yes, it is worth if you are close, but fall short
[6:06:56] tyneetym: have the warlock summon people that are bound in TB they can hearth get boon and then accept summons haha
[6:07:04] Mystiggo: shadow prot potion is nice on this boss. I prefer it over FAP
[6:07:10] Mystiggo: because it stops the mind blasts too
[6:07:12] odesdawg: go full homo
[6:07:19] bomzzwtf: Are the priest nerfs live already?>
[6:07:28] yaaksha: Agree the deep groups are more fun, the ones where you get some dodgy people but still clear 7/7
[6:07:37] tyneetym: Look at Monkahunts gear? Please!! haha
[6:08:18] bomzzwtf: you are bis compared to him
[6:08:25] enjoyinftw: @Mystiggo i just use both. it feels so nice being untouchable
[6:08:26] Mystiggo: swifty macro KEKW
[6:08:54] Mystiggo: I mean yea you can go baller and pop both but kinda unnecessary
[6:09:04] Mystiggo: if every frontliner pops shadow prot, it's like 6k absorb or something
[6:09:09] Mystiggo: everyone is alive forever
[6:09:15] iitsAK: bis hat
[6:09:50] Webbl1: Hickster dinged 10mins before the raid started
[6:10:20] enjoyinftw: @Mystiggo its so cheap, i just pop both and chill. especially if you are pumping and second on threat :P
[6:10:35] Mixedcolors: Thank god randle is a big pumper
[6:10:42] tyneetym: my priest has 0 raid gear but all the prebis and has 2400 mana
[6:11:00] zeuthenx: what server is this?
[6:11:57] tyneetym: @zeuthenx Love Wolf
[6:12:01] tyneetym: Lone*
[6:12:14] Webbl1: If you had PWS rank 4 you would have this
[6:12:18] Mystiggo: hydraLove love wolf
[6:12:18] zeuthenx: ty :) @tyneetym
[6:12:29] DommoUk: smh

[6:13:45] Mystiggo: it was like 3 am as well and we had wiped for a while
[6:13:47] Mystiggo: heartbreaking that
[6:13:53] knutolafx: !phase2
[6:13:53] Nightbot: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24053283/this-week-in-wow-8-january-2024

[6:14:34] Mystiggo: that's like +50 dps
[6:14:35] zeuthenx: :D
[6:14:36] Mystiggo: ez now
[6:14:37] tyneetym: atleast it is not bear
[6:14:40] Stemu: daamn the skinning knife
[6:14:51] yaaksha: I will be needing a carry on Sunday reset in this grp Ryan you better get some preBIS farmed mate
[6:15:38] Arjibhaji: I too will be needing a carry on my warrior again :^)
[6:15:46] mokabear: these people coming for my pet :<

[6:17:09] Mystiggo: closest
[6:17:13] tyneetym: Closest
[6:17:17] yaaksha: You do, that's how I tank it on Shaman
[6:17:23] Mapton30: U need miracle
[6:17:23] yaaksha: I move away if I'm dying lol
[6:18:06] Zalelol: LOL
[6:18:10] Mystiggo: holy shit have not seen this happen since week 1
[6:18:17] Mapton30: ez content XDDD
[6:18:19] yaaksha: Warlocks are the worst class for that, the mobs have magic resist
[6:18:38] tyneetym: Battle Rez?
[6:18:39] yaaksha: Mages can AoE at least, Locks get fkd
[6:19:20] Mystiggo: I'm pretty sure they nerfed the RNG on those. It's max 5 kills and you get the portal now
[6:19:57] yaaksha: If you need the Lock to go down, send them with the Mage since the Mage can AoE
[6:20:05] Beebstv: so how the priest nerfs feeling ?
[6:20:16] Beebstv: no there live
[6:20:19] A6iyx: the nerfs just went live now

[6:20:25] A6iyx: check ur penance ticks lol
[6:20:38] Beebstv: hunter tooltip changed already for nerfs
[6:20:48] Beeaast_: @Hydramist you can imprive raud dosm if you swap 2 hunters into melee group, pets need AP buff
[6:21:18] yaaksha: Penance dmg still unnerfed right?
[6:21:21] yaaksha: So fine for PvP
[6:21:28] enjoyinftw: i am impressed everyone keeps trying and nobody is leaving
[6:22:28] Mystiggo: You killed 5, I swear they changed the RNG protection to be 5
[6:22:30] yaaksha: It's a guild group @enjoyinftw
[6:22:42] Mystiggo: haven't gone over 5 for weeks myself and it used to happen all the time
[6:23:00] Mystiggo: that sucks tho

[6:28:39] yaaksha: This is Lone Wolf EU @Bloch29
[6:28:46] Mystiggo: and sorry for roasting the bear moka. I understand why you'd want to believe in the bear dream
[6:28:52] Mystiggo: but it's just not meant to be Sadge
[6:29:08] Bloch29: @yaaksha why they have a hunter without shoulders?
[6:29:15] yaaksha: Alt group
[6:29:18] Mystiggo: he switched it out for wind serpent when he went back
[6:29:20] mokabear: @Bloch29 listen here, brother
[6:29:27] enjoyinftw: ah has +7agi shoulders for cheap tho
[6:29:44] yaaksha: Ye some people dinged literally 15 min before the raid

[6:43:13] Mystiggo: https://www.twitch.tv/hydramist/clip/AssiduousOilyFinchPrimeMe-zqiVkW_LwiA-0ra-

[6:43:46] DommoUk: my pet died tanking
[6:43:58] vimovo: is he using runes
[6:44:19] Beeaast_: tha cat pet is 25 lvl?
[6:44:32] enjoyinftw: its weird, the pet does all the work, but the hunter gets all the loot...how is that fair?
[6:44:37] HeyImArty: why is the crab called Ryanscarry
[6:44:51] tyneetym: More Wanding is needed
[6:44:53] yaaksha: Same as IRL @enjoyinftw
[6:45:06] Beeaast_: maybe hunter with the cat does not have "beastmastery" rune in hands
[6:45:16] enjoyinftw: @yaaksha arent we playing wow to escape IRL? too real Sadge

[6:49:32] enjoyinftw: @Sinostra if he has it, he needs to wait until stacks fall off

[7:05:23] Sinostra: the escort quests are annoying
[7:05:30] Sinostra: but i can help you with that
[7:07:39] Sinostra: alright
[7:07:56] Sinostra: it might take some time though
[7:09:31] Rayman_1990: yesterday I got moved to another layer while doing the escort q. The mob ofc remained on previous layer Kappa
[7:11:00] BrainlessL: BrainlessL gifted a Tier 1 sub to Sinostra! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel!

[7:11:48] Carapuce1234: rosbeef*
[7:12:13] Sinostra: @Carapuce1234 no need to be rude dude

[7:12:41] Carapuce1234: Only French quarrel :) Cheers man
[7:12:59] Sinostra: @Carapuce1234 je sais moi aussi je suis fran√ßais
[7:13:42] Bloch29: Would a cap to amount of same class in bgs help against premades? LIke agains a premade rn with 4 hunters...
[7:13:47] Sinostra: @Hydramist are you going to wetlands now ?

[7:15:11] Carapuce1234: You think arenas are coming up at 60 ?
[7:15:15] kottessontv: haha but u been playing it since vanilla ?:D im a rogue guy sooo
[7:15:43] xDropperd: Any phase 2 content in the works?
[7:16:00] Mystiggo: priest players are, as the kids say these days, based
[7:16:24] kottessontv: haha me and u did some arenas in cata if im not mistaken:)
[7:16:48] Sinostra: Alliance boon service  always happy to help
[7:17:55] Sinostra: redridge is far
[7:18:43] Sinostra: you're almost 20
[7:19:44] Sinostra: btw, what's the human priest racial ?

[7:23:42] ahyepz: dayum the nerf my penance went from 204 pr tick to 170 xd
[7:24:37] ahyepz: had hoped spellpower would do more as it was basehealing nerf
[7:25:48] Sinostra: taht quest chain is a lot of running around

[7:28:12] Sinostra: i'm hoping the summons make it a bit quicker than the troll
[7:30:19] Mystiggo: priest also gets the meta runes really fast which helps. some classes have to jump through hoops for their big runes
[7:31:13] Mystiggo: only thing that might slow you down is meditations for homunculi if you're unlucky
[7:31:19] Mystiggo: no ppl around that is
[7:32:19] Sinostra: might, yeah
[7:32:48] deltrexz: !song
[7:35:15] Sinostra: can i even see it if i did the quest ?
[7:36:29] Sinostra: it's weird, according to novaworldbuffs, i'm on layer 7 and you 6, but we still can see each other
[7:37:55] Mystiggo: penance nerfed to the ground. *tops himself off with penance*
[7:38:11] Subserd: yoo why human priest?
[7:38:19] Sinostra: need a healthstone ?
[7:38:29] Rayman_1990: it tops when low lvl
[7:42:15] Istunlocklocalpensioners: heroE
[7:44:49] Mystiggo: woke up sad about the priest nerfs
[7:44:56] Mystiggo: sensed a great disturbance in the force like Yoda
[7:45:19] Bloch29: Balance druids also needs nerfs
[7:45:41] Sinostra: your call
[7:45:44] Sinostra: it was to trade
[7:45:52] Mystiggo: ya I'm just memeing. priests still zooming
[7:46:07] Mystiggo: just hope it won't be a trend. otherwise I'm scared for a druid meta
[7:46:13] Mystiggo: and when it's druid meta, nobody is having fun
[7:46:26] yaaksha: Why would they nerf Balance Druids
[7:46:32] yaaksha: C tier DPS mate
[7:46:41] Cupz21: !human
[7:46:52] Mystiggo: it's resto druid that I'm worried about later down the line
[7:47:12] yaaksha: I want Bear Druid buffs

[7:47:22] Turtlepowerx: hoooman???
[7:47:26] yaaksha: Let me use Starsurge in Bear Form
[7:48:24] Mystiggo: like SW:D
[7:48:26] Bloch29: I think the problem with Starsurge is the 42 yard
[7:48:28] Mystiggo: but you trade health
[7:48:34] Sinostra: yeah, it costs like 4 mana, wtf
[7:48:40] Bloch29: Starsurge range should be base 30 yards
[7:49:17] Mystiggo: I think it's fine to have one unique thing about it. whether it's mana cost, large range or high damage
[7:49:21] Mystiggo: but can't have everything
[7:49:38] Mystiggo: the SP scaling is nutty too
[7:49:50] marduxd: Which server?
[7:49:55] Mystiggo: and it'll get 100% crit dmg, 10% base dmg and chance to stun next phase
[7:51:00] Turtlepowerx: wanna do some dms?
[7:52:18] Sinostra: are you coming back to redridge after goldshire ?
[7:52:28] yaaksha: Have to sacrifice 8% dmg on Wrath + Moonfire + Starsurge to get 15% stun @Mystiggo
[7:52:42] Turtlepowerx: face when asked for dungeons https://imgur.com/oUlVDxl
[7:52:44] yaaksha: Or 9% mana cost on all spells you use
[7:52:50] Sinostra: bless you
[7:52:57] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Adge
[7:54:00] yaaksha: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/druid/5000503002541051   Maybe something like this with 4/5 in stun
[7:54:03] Sinostra: it might be hard to find people to summon you back to redridge this time though
[7:54:18] Sinostra: i don't think it is, not sure
[7:54:22] Istunlocklocalpensioners: how is the population still? has it died off a lot
[7:54:30] Istunlocklocalpensioners: or is it still popular
[7:54:30] ph1lthy88: focus spirit tap 5/5 or wand 5/5 or split while leveling?
[7:55:06] Mystiggo: @yaaksha you'll sacrifice the mana cost and pump almost oneshotting, stunning instant casts for like 5 mana at 40+ range
[7:55:16] yaaksha: Yeah probably drop 20% crit dmg to get the 3% stun
[7:56:10] Mystiggo: I went 2 spirit tap, 5 wand, 2 healing focus
[7:56:17] Mystiggo: 2 spirit tap seems enough while chain pulling most times
[7:56:48] Mystiggo: I could see 2 healing focus before wand tho
[7:57:00] Mystiggo: a lot of value while you're pulling many mobs
[7:57:35] Bloch29: What makes shadow priest so good in next phase? A lot of streamers have been talking about playing shadow in phase 2
[7:57:49] ph1lthy88: @Bloch29 shadowform
[7:58:05] Mystiggo: shadow has always been strong at 40. shadowform is such a huge powerspike
[7:58:12] Bloch29: ye, but other than that I mean
[7:58:48] yaaksha: ????
[7:58:49] Frig0z: LUL
[7:59:01] Frig0z: the late night analogies
[7:59:11] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[7:59:14] Sinostra: two rrigues
[7:59:18] Bloch29: hope we get more shadow dmg spells then
[7:59:34] yaaksha: Ryan has tried both
[7:59:40] yaaksha: Speaking from experience
[8:00:36] Mystiggo: also could we not get + shadow resist on every single raid piece from gnomer
[8:00:40] Mystiggo: make it nature res this time around
[8:00:42] Mystiggo: or something
[8:01:52] yaaksha: Will almost certainly be nature res
[8:03:22] Mystiggo: it's racist to have shadow res
[8:03:27] yaaksha: Gnomer will be mechs though
[8:03:37] yaaksha: So probably some nature res with a couple fire res pieces
[8:04:08] Sinostra: damn, i just 1v2 against 2 rogues
[8:04:08] Mystiggo: also if everything is disease immune
[8:04:14] Sinostra: not captured on stream
[8:04:17] Sinostra: sad
[8:04:18] Mystiggo: I will get mad
[8:08:09] Sinostra: i can try to protect you from the rogues
