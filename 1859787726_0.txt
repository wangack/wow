[0:08:15] moderatygos: @shoebill25 i think seeding is based on live rating

[3:51:18] N3rdy_Ta1k: Tony playing his off spec is VERY DIFF than Kasu..
[3:51:21] Lullerokekz: NA plays tomorrow
[3:51:24] eddylol1: hahaha EU is so doomed

[3:51:43] zupa2552: @awfulist it's nice to see different comps
[3:52:08] xxxTotemFuryxxx: why the forfeit?
[3:52:14] nufdragon: Party time? Not playing wow for sure
[3:52:17] 2btac: woah what bonjour forfeited
[3:52:18] awfulist: yeah usually it's the other way around
[3:52:29] Oshleyy: their healer couldnt make it apparently
[3:52:31] eddylol1: niksi needs some notes from avidance
[3:52:42] 2btac: @Oshleyy rough =/
[3:52:42] zupa2552: @eddylol1 lol
[3:52:52] buffrogues: why the forfeit the moonkin was watching the fireworks early
[3:53:03] DhuumFPS: @eddylol1 meackos best druid eu
[3:53:03] LeetSauce_TV: @eddylol1 otherway around probaly tbh :P
[3:53:17] pvkk1: !bonjour
[3:53:18] Moobot: @Xiphiaa Bonjour Bruv team info: https://twitter.com/WoWEsports/status/1674810097619582977?s=20
[3:53:22] eddylol1: @LeetSauce_TV avi would never not use blind in a 5 min arena, but sure bro
[3:53:33] lord_broldamort: Rogue is not trash at all it still has huge play making potential and massive burst
[3:53:50] vennyHD: Why does Chat think that blind is a cd these days? Kappa
[3:53:58] LeetSauce_TV: @eddylol1 does avidance have a blizzcon title under his belt? i don't think so bro
[3:53:59] zupa2552: @eddylol1 you clearly have never played against niksi , he's very good
[3:54:04] buffrogues: assa rogue is good but set bonus rupture makes them unplayable in pvp
[3:54:06] bosslike_: Avidance busy losing in rbg
[3:54:14] TheBidenCrimeFamily: constant rogue nerfs... have don NOTHING for other melee.. Instead, casters have gotten stronger. Devs doing it wrong. You want to see more melee? Tone down casters.
[3:54:15] mjollnier3000: Narnia
[3:54:37] kataxxx: gg vs echo
[3:54:37] Moobot: AWC schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/arena#schedule | MDI schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/esports/mythic/schedule
[3:54:42] tachankus: Supatease saying what we're all thinking lol, GG v Echo would be wicked
[3:54:44] Arcanocrystal: shots fired
[3:54:54] Badanka87: subpar  region :)
[3:54:55] buffrogues: NA is not even close to EU.
[3:55:00] eddylol1: cant even type a normal message without it being restricted. LUL
[3:55:02] BloodSick_PT: or why can't no NA teams emulate EU?
[3:55:06] pharmztko: GG would 4-0 Echo
[3:55:06] Arcanocrystal: gg vs echo would be a very onesided matchup
[3:55:07] KYLPRII: yo, anyone game for 3s, Rsham 2KCR?
[3:55:08] DhuumFPS: lulquid already lowers LUL
[3:55:13] zupa2552: see you on sunday , guys
[3:55:17] combobulous: Dont worry, Merica been better than EU since 1776
[3:55:17] Monduk77: @buffrogues KEK
[3:55:21] TheBidenCrimeFamily: @lord_broldamort Rogues do NOT have massive damage. Keep up on the meta. Assassination rogues have NO burst. Sub have been nerfed considerably. Secret Tech criting for 110K is NOT big burst.. ITs average....
[3:55:27] daniel85mg: liquid vs unitas monkaS
[3:55:30] SirBeaverTeeth: NA competition stronger
