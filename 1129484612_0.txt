[5:03:16] gormless__: WeirdChamp Clear chat
[5:03:21] haackster: we do it tommorrow. le t me check the time
[5:03:41] tooswlo: hssi123 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! We staying strong for soapland
[5:03:42] StreamElements: hssi123 just subscribed for 20 months in a row PogChamp
[5:03:59] CliffWoW: PTR'ing is so dumb. Learn it together.
[5:04:50] gothspada: @jakenbakeLIVE i would try to raid lead if i had access to ptr or hav done the fights in the past but am new
[5:04:53] CliffWoW: Ruin the fresh experience to get maybe a couple extra bosses in the first lockout. ZZZZ
[5:05:33] ifdedwifeisguilty: is the extra juicy content a cosby martini?
[5:06:57] CliffWoW: Trying, failing, learning and improving together it what makes the game so great.
[5:07:19] haackster: so i dont want WoW to be a "job:.. been there done that... but PTR will help when we first go in, so ill do it a couple weeks
[5:08:19] haackster: is rather go to costco with my dad.. but hey being a guildie means help each other
[5:08:27] CliffWoW: Dailies will probably be so fun on faerlina tbh. Will be pvp warzone
[5:10:37] CliffWoW: COPIUM Fury warrior
[5:12:22] bruuuuhhhhhhhhhhh: I watched a Youtube video saying WOW was dead
[5:13:08] haackster: its always people that want to parse that want  another person to play a raid friendly spec... lol its all good but cmon man
[5:13:24] haackster: who wants to play survival..or affliction
[5:13:26] haackster: right?
[5:13:30] haackster: you feel me?
[5:14:26] haackster: me either but its always the andys... same ones... i just wanna progress see "end game tbc" shit again... was so fun
[5:14:35] haackster: wrath is the best ever

[5:15:53] haackster: thats how you parse jake!
[5:16:00] CliffWoW: not having an arms warrior is rough though. 4% to all hunters and melee is likely WAY more than the difference between arms to fury dps

[5:39:36] haackster: @Tsornai jake said it not me!
[5:39:37] Arctauran: @purplehazy with the way things are going for Blizz, shit could hit the fan soon enough. its already bad enough with sub losses and the whole court case against em, but if it does go to court, that could be the ultimate death knell for em
[5:40:23] xxyourfuturenextbfxx: name of hot girl ?
[5:40:38] CliffWoW: Try them on PogU
[5:40:45] haackster: @Arctauran wow will never be gone dude.. ever.. how many "wow killer" games have came out?

[5:41:25] watsupyouguys: 4WeirdJam
[5:41:50] CliffWoW: KEKW
[5:42:07] Arctauran: @haackster its not so much another game doing them in, it could be the courts decimating the higher ups within the company, and even the middle ground team leaders etc, to the point they dont have enough experience to keep the game going. who knows though
[5:42:22] CliffWoW: Kreygasm Warglaives
[5:42:24] Knoives: so sick WICKED
[5:42:47] Arctauran: actually met Ion Hazzikostas at a WoW launch party here in Sydney, and he just gave off an absolute smug kent vibe hey.
[5:43:06] haackster: @Arctauran your right who knows... but im sure blizz got enough money to settle outta court LOL
[5:43:48] CliffWoW: This conversation is actually so cute. WidePeepoHappy
[5:44:21] haackster: JAKE..... when IRL comes back... you not gonna be on wow lol
[5:44:56] Arctauran: @haackster true. but if that does happen, the Shareholders wont be happy, and they may vote to gut the team. things will certainly become interesting for them over the next 6-12 months
