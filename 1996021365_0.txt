[6:17:20] patthepostman96: mouse nice for stuff off gcd
[6:17:22] Ryuko198: i use an mmo mouse just cause i suck at hitting crtl so i bind ctrl to a mouse button

[6:17:35] PeeePeeeHands: he plays all 4 types of wow
[6:17:37] xTheBoB: is that putricide ?
[6:17:41] J1roCS: is there any possibility to make different keybinds for 2 character via ElvUi dont want to switch them everytime i switch the char
[6:17:47] Hoppelben: What specc are you playing on sham? @shroud
[6:17:49] DubOfficial: @shroud blink for your mage?

[6:17:56] ImJstaMrTaco: @Raggamuff I've been testing for it since it started almost a decade ago
[6:18:02] ronniedontknow: i auto walk and L/R click and use XZ to strafe
[6:18:02] dragoniitezz: I'm weird and I have my Earth/Air totems on my mouse buttons
[6:18:04] Helio_FPS: I use my 2 mouse buttons as Control and Alt modifiers
[6:18:09] Hoppelben: @j1rocs Yeah thats a basic game option
[6:18:15] RurryDiff: yes
[6:18:17] falcoistheworsttoptier: Is this classic?
[6:18:18] doom_llama: @j1rocs yah you can enable character specific keybinds
[6:18:20] Snap98: as someone that didn't play much of these games before. i find it very uncomfortable using keyboard modifiers. the more mouse buttons the better
[6:18:20] Raidfire: Shroud hook up some racing pedals and you could use Heal on the breaking ped and Greater Heal on the gas ped :P
[6:18:21] massivewow: @j1rocs do /kb and then select character specific keybinds
[6:18:22] Raggamuff: Clementine?
[6:18:26] stbaran_95: @dragoniitezz utn o weird its fine to play shaman
[6:18:30] senomars: yh just click carachter profile
[6:18:30] 0ldnslow: use rdfg bind shift ctrl and alt to you mouse and see how that works
[6:18:32] senomars: not shared
[6:18:33] PeeePeeeHands: profiles are char based
[6:18:35] ImJstaMrTaco: @Raggamuff yea clem
[6:18:39] saltyssurfer: @j1rocs there is a box for character specific keybinds you have to check
[6:18:49] MintyAce: not true
[6:18:52] XL__: @Raidfire Why not go wild and get a dance pad
[6:18:54] Doomsday1201: shroudWave
[6:18:55] J1roCS: @massivewow thanks i feel kinda stupid now but i really didnt find it
[6:18:59] NoodleNeck33: it just depends on how you started
[6:19:00] rippy15: i think it's more preference
[6:19:05] haxxBase: and also we had no mmo mice back then @shroud
[6:19:06] MarkyOchoa: Shroud ever so nicely called you a scrub
[6:19:07] massivewow: @j1rocs don't feel stupid :)
[6:19:08] Garbashio: yo shroud i rezzed you
[6:19:11] Raggamuff: When Shroud is running multi sessions of Wow with a Goatie in the CA hills.. UK Gaming is slow
[6:19:13] ZIMdb_: i feel like gamers just dont use alot of mice binds, its just not good in most situations
[6:19:13] atisff9999: 60% is almost impossible
[6:19:13] FeelsGoodManX: i think people who played for a long time since before the time mice with 100 buttons dont use those
[6:19:13] thepeople42: is Ironman, behind you, a model or costume?
[6:19:19] DubOfficial: @shroud mage rotation is going to give me Carpal tunnel syndrome
[6:19:19] poptart_tally: Just use a controller
[6:19:21] Yumola1: I‚Äôve played for 16 years now and still use an mmo mouse for WoW, bought the naga when it first came out and got used to it too quick üòÅ
[6:19:21] betabrobot: in an action mmo mouse buttons but mmos like wow keyboard buttons fine
[6:19:22] Snap98: yeah that makes sense
[6:19:33] kandorkaboom: There were MMO mice way back when like Burning Crusade launched. But yes, the OG MMO players that played EQ or WOW early on were keyboard bind only. It's just natural feeling.
[6:19:34] firsttimechatterman: I played csgo with Razer Naga epic so
[6:19:37] rippy15: razer has had a naga since like vanilla/TBC
[6:19:42] thegreatbatzg: ive had one since BC
[6:19:45] FeelsGoodManX: also i think playing other games on an mmo mouse is disgusting
[6:19:45] zAWHmbie: They were expensive when you were 14
[6:19:45] tookkul: WOW,RUNESCAPE,MAPLESTORY,HABBO
[6:19:46] tmac3391: broke my pinky so i had to lol
[6:19:51] Raidfire: Im used to SHIFT,CTRL,ALT + Mouse buttons only LMB,RMB and MMB
[6:19:59] hate_xyz: i'm so used to keybinds on the keyboard
[6:20:01] massivewow: snutz, bean, and chanimal don't use MMO mice
[6:20:03] Alias2552: Anyone playing FPS games with a naga are actual psychos
[6:20:09] haxxBase: pull?
[6:20:12] nesretto: it makes sense
[6:20:14] FeelsGoodManX: @massivewow most players dont, but some do, i think pika does
[6:20:16] oi1egor: @Alias2552 ......
[6:20:18] pglanggg: two different as in two different models right?
[6:20:19] SorcRogier: !server
[6:20:20] Fossabot: @ecaftsohG, Both SoD characters (Horde Orc Shaman/Alliance Pally) are on the Crusader Strike Server
[6:20:20] Hoppelben: logitech g pro wireless is the best mouse ever created imo
[6:20:20] DEFM0NK: Yea use a Xbox controller defm0nLove
[6:20:21] Skkception: i think pvp players is drawn to a mmo mouse a lot more, like sodapoppin
[6:20:23] 0ldnslow: @shroud don't you have to take your fingers off the keys to press 1,2,3,4,5?
[6:20:26] bladegrape: i had a razor naga i tried to play CS with and it was a nightmare XD
[6:20:29] Tokeq: what about one mouse for work, and one for gaming
[6:20:36] IamSPARTAnCUS: i use a mmo mouse for all games. it's felt fine the whole time
[6:20:37] xcampagnex: superlite > all
[6:20:42] CabraBOOM: i use a gaming keypad
[6:20:45] godstrickzz: how many wow versions do u play xD
[6:20:50] kandorkaboom: @0ldnslow no. Everything west of 6, T, G, B is reachable without hand motion if you don't have small hands.
[6:20:53] fobnob9: The specs are not the same
[6:20:55] tookkul: Shroud how often do you visit Canada?
[6:20:56] DubOfficial: @shroud play WoW with an xbox controller shroud4Head
[6:20:57] Snap98: thay arent the s is much much weaker
[6:20:59] MintyAce: pvp mmo mouse is way better casual play keyboard is fine
[6:21:00] pglanggg: wait
[6:21:02] Gunman_90: purfect  SeemsGood
[6:21:03] Doomsday1201: Ôøºthe specs are slightly different
[6:21:03] hate_xyz: KEKWait
[6:21:07] rangerjason: Also disk reader.
[6:21:09] ImJstaMrTaco: @Raggamuff I've always liked the whole leveling PA's by using them and them evolving their effects over pso's buy/drop slightly better dmg PA's
[6:21:19] fobnob9: So confidently wrong
[6:21:25] tmac3391: xD
[6:21:30] thehaljordan: lol
[6:21:30] taderMash: !monitor
[6:21:31] Fossabot: @taderMash He's currently testing the 240 Hz ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM https://info.shroud.fyi/ROGMonitor
[6:21:35] firsttimechatterman: So wrong and so unlike you, Im done with this
[6:21:36] Raggamuff: Blue Bursts model was King
[6:21:50] poptart_tally: But the x is bigger shroud
[6:21:50] kiwi143: does the XS do 1440p?
[6:21:51] gigaton_punch: upscaled 720p at 24fps
[6:22:02] 0ldnslow: @kandorkaboom so when you are running or strafing you can hit the number keys with no issue?  I must be doing something wrong can't do that
[6:22:03] ronniedontknow: see i dont understand how people use WASD to move then use 12345 while moving
[6:22:06] Raggamuff: The PAs were a good system. It was just a wierd downgrade with the style and the weapons
[6:22:08] atwelveyearold: Shroud sorry for asking this, I haven't watched you in over 2 years. Do you still play pubg?
[6:22:09] ronniedontknow: its so weird to me
[6:22:15] Snap98: no youre wrong shroud
[6:22:29] Raggamuff: Like Hunting that Gargoyle for the Bow was ASS
[6:22:29] massivewow: @ronniedontknow move with mouse, hold strafe left right while using abilities
[6:22:31] hillary__duff: 4 teraflops vs 12
[6:22:33] fobnob9: You are 100% wrong
[6:22:39] kandorkaboom: @0ldnslow yeah a large amount of my movement in an MMO is viewstrafing (so using rightclick + Q and E) which keeps my center of view on the boss or whatever I'm doing. numkey tapping while doing that is super easy
[6:22:41] Aypex01: yea actually incorrect
[6:22:41] Doomsday1201: Rockstar would be dumb to not release gta on pc on release
[6:22:45] pglanggg: processor is 2x the S
[6:22:46] hate_xyz: he's not wrong tho
[6:22:46] TaNbULL: The Series S is significantly less powerful than the X
[6:22:48] pglanggg: *3x
[6:22:54] poptart_tally: One is built like a mini fridge and the other is built like a toaster oven
[6:22:55] Snap98: there a reason bg3 took so long to come to xbox and its because the s was very underpowered
[6:23:03] hate_xyz: lots of people don't know about how much resolution affects fps
[6:23:10] taderMash: how are you enjoying the rog swift for fps?
[6:23:15] EddieMalfunction: what 25m raid is this
[6:23:15] Skirent: Even if specs seem to be the same, the technology of particular components was improved af itself
[6:23:17] realchugfourloko: but game loading and what not...........
[6:23:19] Snap98: even then its much slower
[6:23:20] fobnob9: My man played WoW for a few days and his brain got fried
[6:23:23] Doomsday1201: effectively both would get the same frame rate
[6:23:24] 0ldnslow: @kandorkaboom cool i will have to try that ty
[6:23:26] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[6:23:27] thehaljordan: The storage space is an issue
[6:23:40] 2FiveOh: Says the guy playing on 200% render scale Kappa
[6:23:46] TaNbULL: The devs do render their games at a lower internal resolution on the Series S than X already.
[6:23:46] CubicleGangster: The GPU between the X and S is drastically different. As is the memory sub system.
[6:23:48] Snap98: also the x doesnt run native 4k alot of the time
[6:23:50] kandorkaboom: @0ldnslow to be fair though I've been playing MMOs for 20 years. So it's just muscle memory now. If people aren't used to it, that might not feel natural :o
[6:23:52] CubicleGangster: CPU is similar
[6:24:03] optiikalbs: you hear they're predicting 1bil first week of sales
[6:24:05] pglanggg: i mean it does take more to run in 4k
[6:24:14] pglanggg: but do folks actually run 4k
[6:24:17] DubOfficial: lots of people worry about the resolution when their gaming skill is DooDoo
[6:24:22] DubOfficial: why
[6:24:25] PeeePeeeHands: this fight is such a clusterfuck
[6:24:26] ronniedontknow: @massivewow yeah thats what i do WASD are abilitys for me i auto walk strafe left and right and backwards anything forward it mouse click move and auto walk i think its cause i play with mage it works so well
[6:24:30] kcept: whats the difference between classic and sod?
[6:24:49] ronniedontknow: played mage for 5 years back in the day and been back for a year or so now still feels best for me
[6:24:49] zacharyf1995: you get shadowmourne yet ?
[6:24:50] pglanggg: idk havent bought a console since ps2 lol
[6:24:50] 0ldnslow: @kandorkaboom i have been playing a long time just never heard of it done that way and rebound keys around edsf
[6:24:52] h1z1survivor420: IS THAT icc?
[6:24:55] xdrpeeper: Wow takes no skill, it takes simple class knowledge.
[6:25:04] hkay1: is this the server where if you die you start from start again?
[6:25:07] ImJstaMrTaco: @Raggamuff oh yea PSU single player was awful and the online continuation for the story is unrecoverable and no footage of it exist
[6:25:14] slashloltv: the tanks are horrible fiy
[6:25:15] Snap98: yeah not enough gpu performance. only a 2080 super class card in the x
[6:26:03] BerserkZodd: 5% buff peepoHappy
[6:26:19] Raggamuff: Blue Burst Ep4 was the best PSO IMO.. Hundreds and Hundred of hours
[6:26:29] clancylegit: let's not talk about the belt Sadge
[6:26:34] Flodimo: its a wipe i think
[6:26:39] miraulsainter: no trinket for me =/ 0/8 id
[6:26:49] BerserkZodd: @miraulsainter F

[6:43:57] RoyalSoyl: I'm on alliance cmon man
[6:44:04] OhrfeigenOtto: Yes
[6:44:05] chaserstyu: re watch vods on twitch
[6:44:11] Gunnan22: yes
[6:44:13] TiltLO: i dont think alliance has gotten rep since launch
[6:44:16] LASHN: i might rerolll to ally and show them the way
[6:44:33] OhrfeigenOtto: idk how they release something like this 20 y afterr AV
[6:44:33] RoyalSoyl: it's just not worth for alliance wsg is way faster
[6:44:34] xcampagnex: ez win
[6:44:35] thefakeazn: didnt know shrood had shadowmourne KEKW no wonder he's pumping
[6:44:36] OhrfeigenOtto: I mean they knew
[6:44:38] Hawkyy: have you done lk 25hc yet?
[6:44:39] Gunnan22: You get 100 rep for each sub boss killed and 500 for the win
[6:44:41] critykat: they're all rerolling horde then
[6:44:42] syotos012: that seems to be common in every server.
[6:44:44] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[6:44:44] Cteddyo: can you just farm nodes/mobs in ashenvale and get rep if your factions winning the events?
[6:44:48] Kob1n24: on wild growth alliance has won every single one lol @shroud
[6:44:49] TiltLO: its primarily because it is ashenvale, close to org far from stormwind so gg
[6:44:57] Cap1che: i mean if alliance were smart then they would camp their own boss?
[6:44:58] americanbobkat: yeah thats like the first time theyve EVER done that
[6:44:59] Demobalderes: What happens right now is Horde just starts at the end boss and rushes it in like 30 seconds and wins instantly on EU
[6:45:02] Osean13: doesnt alliance have a port to BFD in auberdine?
[6:45:02] a_oc: @shroud will you play cata classic?
[6:45:17] RoyalSoyl: @Osean13 no? does horde have a port
[6:45:17] tannydanner: they missed the mark on a lot of things with SoD
[6:45:35] Cap1che: that's the real classic experience
[6:45:35] dutch_blazewell: Its a lagfest thars for sure
[6:45:37] BerserkZodd: let the loser get 30% rep = worth a bit for the loser
[6:45:40] H2oJacKle: in asmon stream it's lag so much that can't do anything
[6:45:49] bongbuilder7589: is this ashenvale event ?
[6:45:51] damitlamit: they just need better servers.
[6:45:52] Lezlino: they should have made the side bosses worth a substantial amount of rep then people would be more incentivized to actually kill them
[6:45:53] Gunnan22: Each faction wins battles on different layers.  They all happen at the same time
[6:45:56] ChanceC: It'll be interesting to see what they do for phase 2 and if they make changes to that system
[6:46:00] Twitch_TVeizer: play pubg shroud
[6:46:09] fantaenjoyer1: wtf is happening on this screen
[6:46:12] H2oJacKle: 20 years old game LUL
[6:46:19] Oujimai: no thanks
[6:46:21] paddyoryder: @Twitch_TVeizer dont tell him what to do
[6:46:23] Bone_Spurs: bad take
[6:46:28] Kas50: @Twitch_TVeizer sit in the corner and be quiet random person
[6:46:33] Oujimai: That's just another BG
[6:46:33] dutch_blazewell: Not a bad idea SeemsGood
[6:46:34] Hanketsi: thats not world pvp then is it?? thats a shit take
[6:46:38] leblabliblu: Wintergrasp type stuff
[6:46:39] critykat: Like Ashran in WoD
[6:46:42] sbfire78: Wintergrasp 2.0
[6:46:43] Demobalderes: It needs to be a pvp event, right now it's a pve event
[6:46:46] swordislife: like tol barad
[6:46:46] Twitch_TVeizer: @paddyoryder ahhaahah i just want him to see play pubg agian
[6:46:47] tannydanner: that's wintergrasp lol
[6:46:51] Oujimai: @critykat yea, which no one likes
[6:46:54] g0nza_a: are u gonna play the day before at launch?
[6:46:55] Hanketsi: its not world pvp then :D
[6:46:57] Ryuko198: people hate that cause no open world..... thats the only reason why they dont do that... they are so caught up with open world everything
[6:46:58] spionballa07: Do you get honor from wpvp kils ?
[6:47:00] Warpiercer: It should be like Ashran. Its used to be hub, and you could join the fight just by walking to the battle zone. And it was going 24/7 @shroud
[6:47:00] Fossabot: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[6:47:00] jeep2390: wow isnt about having fun
[6:47:03] griefedgator: alliance pop will die when asmon leaves
[6:47:06] swordislife: tol barad was good
[6:47:11] Alias2552: Tol Barad was pretty goated
[6:47:11] Twitch_TVeizer: play pubg shroud!
[6:47:14] TiltLO: its just bad its just a dps race on a pve mob, the objectives and everything is irrelevant
[6:47:15] Hawkyy: Wintergrasp was amazing back in WoTLK idk abdout now
[6:47:20] drakethewhelp: theres no pvp anyway
[6:47:23] OhrfeigenOtto: If they want Open World PvP they should make ressources interessting their. Look at Pearl Farmspots, ppl are ganking each other for Murlocs
[6:47:24] ThiefXLFT: wintergrasp used to be open world, it was a lag fest back then too
[6:47:26] holrem: Sad times. I enjoyed wintergrasp lol everyone always hates
[6:47:27] 2Sav4u: its possible
[6:47:36] metrohonky: layers tho
[6:47:38] kcept: !questie
[6:47:40] critykat: @Oujimai true but was good honor tho
[6:47:48] zyk91: its just open world AV, kinda boring
[6:47:53] dutch_blazewell: Moar layers for the area
[6:48:03] IamSPARTAnCUS: albion online gets away with it kind of, I would think WoW would be able to do it.
[6:48:18] dragoniitezz: War style BG where you have to cap like 3 forts that get progressively harder, and if they take yours you have to take it back to work the other way into their territory.
[6:48:33] tannydanner: they need to add very limited time random events, like 5-10 mins to prevent a ton of people from showing up
[6:48:37] cjiui: wow has a hold of shroud right now
[6:48:40] holrem: @iamspartancus 50v50 zergs in Albion was fun
[6:48:46] skipflex: agreed
[6:48:47] hackinglove: make it like 25 v 25 PETTHESHROUD
[6:48:54] og_clawz: bro what happend to pubg is it dead down?
[6:48:59] fatmcgatt: SOD is banging though
[6:49:00] lmd1811: there are adjustments coming, josh greenfield tweeted something about the event, so they are fixing it
[6:49:06] fotthewhuck: @cjiui every once in a while he gets sucked hard
[6:49:08] skipflex: im on alliance on crusader its rough out here for ashen
[6:49:08] MasterGoofy: just make bosses invulnerable untill all 3 liutenants are killed
[6:49:40] IamSPARTAnCUS: @holrem the small team pvp was fun, but the thousand man fights were extremely fun if you had good commanders
[6:49:59] Kais2kz: Wtf is all this on the screen lol
[6:50:24] Salic_Crane: saliccSpinningceltic Hello There saliccSpinningceltic just making the rounds of people that I follow to see how they are doing.

[6:51:47] administrateror: is this season of discovery?
[6:51:54] shme18: pubg?
[6:52:07] TheyCallMeProphet: TheyCallMeProphet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 65 months! 
[6:52:08] fanaticqz: tglDrip
[6:52:11] Buttholejoe: damn shrouds a 99 parser
[6:52:15] dragoniitezz: @ZahidAbi This is WotLK ICC
[6:52:24] Moosepiss1: is this csgo
[6:52:25] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: is this season of mastery?
[6:52:29] Hawkyy: Whats your LK progress?
[6:52:30] PeeePeeeHands: I wonder what the future of SoD will be like with all the data they are gathering, I think this lvl 25 SoD is like a beta
[6:52:50] flashnickgg: BongoTap
[6:53:05] Flodimo: KEKW
[6:53:15] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: actually only 1% of players get 99% parses
[6:53:15] shme18: lxformOoohhhh
[6:53:20] gellodog: you get 99 if you have shadowmourne regardless of skill in wotlk
[6:53:25] Demobalderes: It's easier to parse in classic because there are more people to compete with - less people means less spots for each bracket
[6:53:32] McDanduu: u played unholy in a normal guild try 99parse :D
[6:53:38] lucidakamaze: ITs a big difference betwen wotlk 99 parser and wotlk 50 parser. as a raidleader it will predict the whole run
[6:53:43] a_oc: will you play cata?
[6:53:46] alawma: Shroud have u killed Lich King 25 Heroic?
[6:53:54] eaglzboss: Do u still play retail
[6:53:58] buzz97: its not off of ilvl
[6:54:00] DEFM0NK: I don't think you can
[6:54:03] buzz97: unless u look at "by ilvl"
[6:54:18] dragoniitezz: Theres overall parse and iLvl parse

[7:03:39] fourjojo: cata with changes, wonder what changes
[7:03:41] DubOfficial: i leveled my mage to 70 in 3 days just so i can join in on your raids XD
[7:03:42] sprCircuit: is this game newbie friendly if you have never played this types of games?
[7:03:43] kellarXO: My problem with Cata is why would I say it when I can play retail
[7:03:54] kellarXO: Play it*
[7:04:12] ItsYent: yeah retail is def the most enjoyable for me
[7:04:23] achilles144: lol you playing 2 games?

[7:04:36] 8ydand: why do you like retail more?
[7:04:59] damitlamit: what are some good things about shaman? i see you've played that class for a while now
[7:05:02] fourjojo: for the first time I actually feel like class design is in a good spot in retail
[7:05:07] DragoBonkers: retail is probably in the best spot it's been for quite some time
[7:05:07] triplezro: true
[7:05:09] DubOfficial: when he said he was addicted, he meant hes REALLY ADDICTED
[7:05:10] holrem: See all that down time between pulls? Need a second game
[7:05:11] Fiffy: more engaging?

[7:05:14] dogfesk: combat is a lot more interesting in retail
[7:05:20] Bobsled_: how is it not
[7:05:28] omgbaph: from someone who took years break from wow coming back to retail, i enjoy it way more
[7:05:29] ItsYent: @Fiffy the combat is more engaging
[7:05:33] Fiffy: the combat sure
[7:05:36] Fiffy: the game no shot
[7:05:40] Bobsled_: ?
[7:05:49] Fiffy: u have to do 50000 chores
[7:05:50] holrem: What class do you play in retail?
[7:05:53] Fiffy: in order to maintain any competition
[7:05:56] breekicheeki9: im loving my enhance shaman
[7:05:56] drakethewhelp: tbh retail scares me
[7:05:59] philmedian: wow is just fun
[7:06:01] Skandalee: I can absolutely argue that retail is hot garbage
[7:06:02] ItsYent: @Fiffy kekw this is an old take that is outdated
[7:06:02] breekicheeki9: its fun af
[7:06:05] kellarXO: @fiffy no you don't
[7:06:06] omgbaph: @Fiffy yeah its a mmo its not suppose to be easy 4head
[7:06:09] isupremeiq: Sod or retail ?
[7:06:13] Fiffy: How do u not
[7:06:14] cloudyeyez_: 92% ashenvale @shroud
[7:06:14] JacobBose: Retail key grind is nice.
[7:06:14] dogfesk: there's literally no must do chore in retail now
[7:06:15] BugsFreakingBunny: Fiffy howso? im competitive in mythic + and im doing 0 chores a day,
[7:06:15] Hawkyy: Wait and see if they ever do MoP Classic, every class was FOTM and felt amazing
[7:06:18] xladaa: just got back into retail played season 1 skipped season 2
[7:06:18] Vivald: @Fiffy no you dont just do m+ and raid, that's it
[7:06:22] MikeMeltz: catJAM
[7:06:24] Fiffy: @ChopperChopsuey id love to hear ur definition of competitive
[7:06:24] BugsFreakingBunny: i log on do m+ and raid,
[7:06:24] Hanketsi: @Fiffy what chores? literally can lvl up and be up to everyone else in 2-3 days of gearing in m+
[7:06:28] HusqvarnaCV: riad dps is soooo bad tbh
[7:06:30] ItsYent: they have been got rid of the chores
[7:06:34] brandenlives: grind ain‚Äôt even bad in retail. got 446 last season easily
[7:06:35] BugsFreakingBunny: Id love to hear yours, since it requires chores ?
[7:06:35] ItsYent: thats an old ass take
[7:06:38] BugsFreakingBunny: what chores
[7:06:41] nickcannonsjokewriter: i dont have enough patience to get caught up in retail
[7:06:41] yzkeee: no you only have to do damage
[7:06:42] Fiffy: @Hanketsi if u dont fill ur vault ur behind by default
[7:06:45] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[7:06:45] ItsYent: there arent any chores lmao
[7:06:47] tinksc: Retail has turned into a whole different kind of min maxing beast with a bajillion tactics. I don't like the direction of the general gameplay but the raiding and combat is super engaging
[7:06:53] matching_towels: you don‚Äôt need to raid if you prefer m+
[7:06:55] fastdafuRiuz: catJAM
[7:06:55] BugsFreakingBunny: Filling your vault = doing 8 mythics through a week
[7:06:59] JacobBose: Wings on retail is 1m cd lol
[7:07:10] Azathul: starting as a new player in retail is nice, all the mobs scale to your level up to 50. And you can time walk to play through all the expansions if you wanted to
[7:07:13] dimsumdaily: I think you just have to get a tag on the boss
[7:07:22] BugsFreakingBunny: Apparantly thts what you do in vanilla i guess, log on and get loot with 0 effort
[7:07:22] Veekkie: I have been enjoying retail, just casually running around and doing random stuff and testing/leveling different classes, haven't played in ages so it's all wondrous new for me
[7:07:24] Fiffy: ok to everybody on my butt rn when i say competitive im not talking about the people that complete a 20 weekly and chill
[7:07:33] brandenlives: getting shit from the vault feeels so good bruh
[7:07:35] kellarXO: ICC is so weird one boss has 1 mechanic another has 6
[7:07:36] Juanstar: ‚Äúwasnt paying attention‚Äù (instantly switches to other toon) lol
[7:07:39] fourjojo: 2 min as holy Sadge
[7:07:42] BugsFreakingBunny: u do know pushing 25's doesnmt require a single chore either,
[7:07:44] shhamus: Shroud
[7:07:58] Fiffy: pushing 25s
[7:08:01] Fiffy: damn ok
[7:08:02] holrem: You also main paladin in retail?
[7:08:04] Fiffy: let me rephrase
[7:08:06] Thejokerkid: @Azathul yeah tis really cool
[7:08:17] brandenlives: retails only chore was doing the mission to get the shadow flame for crafting lol
[7:08:20] Fiffy: In order to compete with the best u need to constantly do all forms of content
[7:08:21] Alias2552: Why are we acting like the regular retail player can just log on and slam 25s?
[7:08:26] dogfesk: it's not like vanilla didn't have any chores with all the world buffs
[7:08:35] Fiffy: @ItsYent i never said i was the majority of the player base..
[7:08:39] kellarXO: One thing I miss in retail from wrath is all the engineering tinkers like nitro boots and haste gloves
[7:08:41] Fiffy: nor did i say its the same for majority of the playerbase
[7:08:44] SkyraStyles: !server
[7:08:44] Fossabot: @SkyraStyles, Both SoD characters (Horde Orc Shaman/Alliance Pally) are on the Crusader Strike Server
[7:08:47] BugsFreakingBunny: fiffy in what game, to COMPETE with the BEST dont you have to do what they do ? u just gotta do what u gotta do in this matter.
[7:08:54] Thejokerkid: @Alias2552 yeah i struggle with 12 and higher lol
[7:09:01] Fiffy: @ChopperChopsuey ur contradicting yourself.. u gotta do what u gotta do which is the chores..
[7:09:08] BugsFreakingBunny: what chores again, u gotta tell me
[7:09:12] BugsFreakingBunny: cuz doing mythic dungeons aint no chore
[7:09:13] unk1nd: :D
[7:09:19] Bobsled_: Fiffy you said the game was less engaging, but never said how classic is more engaging .. then now you say retail what? less competitive? im confused bruh
[7:09:20] scorpi0nkvv: Hi
[7:09:20] brandenlives: playing the game isn‚Äôt a chore for everyone
[7:09:24] BugsFreakingBunny: and thats what we gotta do,
[7:09:28] kellarXO: Doing the bare minimum story line is not a chore
[7:09:32] dogfesk: the previous 3 expansions had tedious chores sure
[7:09:37] kcept: what happened?
[7:09:43] Fiffy: @Bobsled_ the game is less engaging because in order for me to personally compete with the best i need to devote 16 hours a day to a game cause thats what they do.
[7:09:46] Fiffy: That doesnt sound engaging
[7:09:48] BugsFreakingBunny: Im confused with his hole "chore" thing, i mean i havent even finished the story campaign from the first dragonflight season
[7:09:58] dimsumdaily: youre good
[7:10:00] Bobsled_: that has nothing to do with engagement, what
[7:10:01] dimsumdaily: 96
[7:10:03] brandenlives: then don‚Äôt compete with the best lol
[7:10:03] hackinglove: KEKW
[7:10:12] herohid2: what is that on ur mouth
[7:10:13] Fiffy: @Bobsled_ It makes it alot less engaging to me how does it not ?
[7:10:22] BangBootie: Is icc heroic?
[7:10:23] ajbrew: im confused what this content is as just a retail player lol
[7:10:24] scorpi0nkvv: @ItsYent i think its new content for classic
[7:10:24] Fiffy: @ItsYent how do u not??
[7:10:30] brandenlives: mans mad cuz he gotta play the game
[7:10:39] BugsFreakingBunny: shit man playing the game to be the best, is a chore i guess
[7:10:41] 61661k: !addons
[7:10:41] Fossabot: @61661k Here's a list of his WoW addons (this is slightly out of date, update coming soon)- https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT

[7:10:52] Kas50: @emisato yes
[7:10:53] Hza3: did u overclock ur pc @shroud
[7:10:53] fourjojo: people arguing about retail and classic KEKW just play what you want, its subjective
[7:10:56] Kroski: @Fiffy Why do you impose on yourself to wanna compete with the absolute 1% lol
[7:11:10] Fiffy: @Kroski cause thats what I have been for the past 10 years of playing this game
[7:11:11] kaizyynn: I‚Äôm new to retail and I just completed zandalar story at lvl 41 an
[7:11:15] d3monical: Everyone spouting classic the best 2 weeks ago now everyone's shitting on it lol

[7:11:39] hvnorhell: shroud look better w facial hair
[7:11:40] Fiffy: @ItsYent in what regard? raiding? world firsts, rank 1 progression on io? arena?
[7:11:42] ValkaTv: 400dpi to 800 @shroud ? :)
[7:11:53] kaizyynn: I‚Äôm new to retail and just completed the msq in zandalar at lvl 41 and idk where to go now
[7:12:05] jojoneutron: That was gonna happen
[7:12:05] Zaxery: is the 5$ buff out?

[7:12:11] excent_: classic blizzard, adding pve to a pvp zone
[7:12:11] Fiffy: @ItsYent id love for u to link me one person in the top 100 of io
[7:12:12] jojoneutron: Everyone rolled horde
[7:12:15] Fiffy: that doesnt play this for a living
[7:12:17] Fiffy: KEKW
[7:12:21] cesartcab: @kaizyynn whatever timeline u like tbh , but shadowlands is faster i guess
[7:12:30] ItsYent: damn i cant type raider   io
[7:12:35] vonmaur: @kaizyynn Go to the board in capital city and pick an expansion to continue questing in
[7:12:36] Fiffy: just say io homie
[7:12:44] Fiffy: i get what u mean :D
[7:12:47] ethorslays: boss is too easy
[7:12:52] jojoneutron: Everyone went horde on crusader strike.  Alliance got a bunch of asmon andy's and don't really contribute.
[7:12:59] s1ipknot_maggot: what is the add-on for the names in left corner
[7:13:00] Thejokerkid: @kaizyynn hed to you main faction city and talk to chromie to switch timelines you you can contiue to quests and level up tp get to the current xpax and join the fun
[7:13:03] zanthran: what does it matter if you are the top 100?
[7:13:08] ethorslays: pvp boss should be very hard imo
[7:13:08] kaizyynn: so that‚Äôs it for the base game msq besi @vonmaur
[7:13:14] DOMEN99_: How can i get that UI u have?
[7:13:24] Gheckko: boss name? for target macro:D
[7:13:24] zanthran: If you are good someone is still going to see if, assuming you network and play with anyone who would care if you are good
[7:13:25] ItsYent: @Fiffy my friend Knowsy SPriest is 46th in the world and he plays barely over 20 hours a week...
[7:13:35] Fiffy: @ItsYent 46th spriest in the world?
[7:13:41] ItsYent: damn even the streamer is agreeing
[7:13:41] kaizyynn: @vonmaur so is that the end of the msq in the base game even tho I‚Äôm not 50?
[7:13:56] Fiffy: @shroud homie u dont even get invited to anything if ur not a mythic end raider
[7:13:58] Miko4tw: "plays barely three hours a day"
[7:13:58] ItsYent: @Fiffy just said a top 100....
[7:14:00] Fiffy: to the highest keys
[7:14:01] zanthran: thank you shroud xD
[7:14:03] Fiffy: @ItsYent top 100 what
[7:14:09] matching_towels: pugging is ok but is inefficient
[7:14:10] Fiffy: is he the top 100 priest
[7:14:12] ItsYent: holy hell this guy is moving the goal post
[7:14:13] Fiffy: or does he have a top 100 rn
[7:14:15] vonmaur: @kaizyynn afaik 60 is base game without latest expansion so you should be able to
[7:14:22] s1ipknot_maggot: what is the add on for the names in the left corner please
[7:14:31] ItsYent: just say you are a boomer who hates he couldnt adapt to the game.
[7:14:31] zanthran: Network, or you'll be a silent sleeper forever no matter how good
[7:14:38] poptune: @shroud what do you think about s3? seems alot easier than s1 or s2
[7:14:48] ItsYent: that 16 hours a day comment was a huge indicator
[7:14:51] Thejokerkid: @kaizyynn the way the scaleing works without heirlooms you can finsh the xpac quests before you reach cap
[7:14:51] Fiffy: @ItsYent damn man ive not insulted or said anything negative to or about you once
[7:14:55] vonmaur: @poptune Way easier than previous 2 seasons, free +20s
[7:15:04] ItsYent: im just saying bro you keep moving the goal post bro
[7:15:08] Fiffy: @ItsYent thought we were just having a civil discussion
[7:15:12] DeathKittn: @Fiffy Bro, if you don't like the game than you don't like it. Your bad experiences don't reflect on others and you are not the golden standard for wow players. Some people enjoy it, some people don't. Chill out
[7:15:20] Fiffy: @ItsYent i asked u for 1 person that has a top 100 run in io that doesnt do it for a living
[7:15:25] Fiffy: @DeathKittn i love the game what
[7:15:32] DOMEN99_: How can i get that UI u have? Û†ÄÄ

[7:15:54] MasterGoofy: people dont want to inv to layers so they are in the 40 people that get rep lol
[7:15:54] poptune: @vonmaur thats my thought aswell. i never did +22 on 2 chest on the second week
[7:15:55] chippymojo: shroudLove
[7:15:56] Thejokerkid: @DOMEN99_ he has to share it it might be on his doescord or swomthing
[7:16:03] abarus4: isn't a command line to switch layer?  used to be. used it when came out to farm for race pets
[7:16:08] ItsYent: @Fiffy the top 100 players play this game for a living and all play together going back to shroud's point. if you have good friends you can push. everyone started somewhere those guys at the top rn werent always at the top
[7:16:12] poptune: @vonmaur before this season
[7:16:19] xZukini: im addicted aswell shroud and its my first month playing wow
[7:16:28] Fiffy: @ItsYent Yes but thats what im saying to a casual player there is no point of entry to that environment
[7:16:30] Jaffe777: is this hardcore?
[7:16:33] Fiffy: Which to ME is not engaging
[7:16:33] ItsYent: you wanna just logon solo and push against the best players in the world who play together
[7:16:43] Jaffe777: what wow is this ? classic?
[7:16:44] vonmaur: @poptune Yeah pushed 1st week, did a 20 just now on my 440 resto shaman for weekly. Its kinda silly ngl

[7:16:52] ItsYent: @Fiffy dude you are arguing for why you cant be the top 00.1% of players
[7:16:54] abarus4: I can't see them turn that command off, because core get people of the same group in same area
[7:17:01] ItsYent: its engaging for the majority player base
[7:17:02] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[7:17:02] zanthran: isn't classic the same way? they look at the gear you don't have and they don't want you in the group
[7:17:06] Fiffy: @ItsYent hell yea it is
[7:17:07] Jaffe777: is this hardcore classic ?
[7:17:07] ItsYent: yes
[7:17:10] Fiffy: never said it wasnt
[7:17:11] Thejokerkid: @kaizyynn np what faction are you, and just google chrome time "faction here" on google and wowhead show you where she is let me know if you have any other questions
[7:17:11] ItsYent: classic is 100% elitst
[7:17:13] Fiffy: but for me it isnt
[7:17:16] TheBigGigz: they need to fix that event bad
[7:17:18] ItsYent: classic is insanely elitist
[7:17:26] poptune: @vonmaur yeah it seems weird. sure i starte decked out with 445ilvl but still
[7:17:26] sephiroth1150: Hi Shroud good morning from thailand dude HeyGuys shroudDab
[7:17:29] Fiffy: My whole argument was that for me it wasnt engaging

[7:19:46] stareatme: thoughts on Diablo 4?
[7:19:55] Miko4tw: Classic is a joke of a game anyway, it's truly beyond me why anyone would play a 20 year old game in 2023
[7:19:59] PsyNytes: @Fiffy No complaints on my end, doing ok. How bout you?
[7:20:09] lnduced: mana isnt a thing in retail
[7:20:13] MEDORIA_xXx: play CS2 :(
[7:20:13] Polaris345: edgelord456 subscribed with Prime. 
[7:20:25] Fiffy: Solid, aside from having to defend myself for having an opinion but I could be a littleeee less opinionated i guess KEKW
[7:20:29] lwisecarver: @Miko4tw I love when people say this shit. Other people find different things fun? They play classic because they enjoy it
[7:21:00] PsyNytes: @Fiffy good to hear, other than the defending thing üëÄ
[7:21:07] BoltznNutz: Shroatee making a comeback!
[7:21:07] bee1eslayer: @Miko4tw I didn't get why it was so heavily played in 2013, I said same about 10 year old game, yet here we are xdd
[7:21:07] Miko4tw: lwisecarver it's objectively antiquated and poorly designed game by modern standards. There is also nothing to discover, it's just a grinding simulator
[7:21:07] vepsee: @Miko4tw yeah I know hard concept people like different things KEKW
[7:21:12] Fiffy: haha nah tbf i started a discussion i shouldnt have @PsyNytes the usual
[7:21:13] vonmaur: @Miko4tw Some people like slower paced games that arent too challenging, nostalgia. A multitude of reasons
[7:21:25] lwisecarver: @Miko4tw once again youre missing the fact that people are playing for fun
[7:21:30] vepsee: @Miko4tw me thinks you dont know what objectively means
[7:21:33] zanthran: old games are fun. They may be a bit dated, but the gameplay foundations they were built around were awesome
[7:21:35] Miko4tw: Don't get me wrong, I killed kelthuzad in vanilla back in 2008, but it's just objectively bad today
[7:21:36] OhYeahitsKT: LMFAO

[7:24:13] Guavacado: with blacksmithing
[7:24:13] Fiffy: blacksmithing thing i reckon
[7:24:19] xhairbait: @Fiffy ^
[7:24:20] xZukini: why is SOD and HC wow so addicting
[7:24:47] Elmo_Omle: sheild enchant  is the other option
[7:24:51] Libertyjam: is he playing 2 characters at same time? GIGACHAD energy
[7:24:56] csjustin: Hi chat, im thinking of trying WoW. Should i play retail, classic, or wotlk
[7:24:58] xZukini: @Libertyjam fr
[7:25:02] alien1388: @xZukini Short awnser , for me the game and gearing and every peice i get feels rewarding but i am a new player so everything is fresh  :)
[7:25:13] Xrudee: this is also where you buy your neck later btw ^^
[7:25:19] thebigboomba: I've never played World of warcraft before and mannnn is is so tempting to buy watching this
[7:25:24] crslk: really liking this overlay setup , so clean
[7:25:43] zanthran: it can be a fun game. It is very rough getting into when you first start out though
[7:25:50] Balliistic1: shroud will you play cata?
[7:25:54] paullydod: @csjustin start in retail. get the feel. its a lot easier for new players. easier to lvl get gold and mounts and such. then if you wanna dive into classic you can but it is a lot harder to get into
[7:26:05] penneybridge: huh
[7:26:07] thebigboomba: ^ Thats what I'm afraid of, the noob beginnings...
[7:26:28] OhrfeigenOtto: @thebigboomba i wont end your IRL by tellin u hc/sod/wrath without buying the game, just by subscription
[7:26:29] personguy101: oh shit i use that same ui in retail didnt expect to see it
[7:26:30] thebigboomba: Whats retail?
[7:26:30] mrbyex: Is wow really that good?
[7:26:31] blurTTV: shroud4Head
[7:26:33] penneybridge: cata pvp was the best
[7:26:34] spaknot01: every beginnings are fun haha
[7:26:34] alien1388: @csjustin  i thought it was the opposite , way harder to learn and rush higher levels with 100000 spels  trinkets , mechanics etc ?
[7:26:35] ezvva: do you gonna play the day before ??
[7:26:37] mastropiero9: On this boss u have to bumb the music
[7:26:41] noaimmm: as someone who never played wow before, where would i belong classics or retail?
[7:26:48] ValkaTv: are u in the Rust twitch rivals ?
[7:26:57] mrbyex: Kreygasm
[7:27:01] The_Red_Ace_: Imagine if WoW had GTA 6 graphics....
[7:27:02] zanthran: biggest thing will be if you get to group content, just ignore the aholes. there will be plenty of them expecting everyone to have played as much as them
[7:27:09] bloodstuck2000: Wow da bomb
[7:27:10] 2001_clemens: @ValkaTv classic
[7:27:13] seafoolol: @The_Red_Ace_ not a single person would care
[7:27:22] ezvva: @The_Red_Ace_ then you need a nasa pc
[7:27:28] ScottyHawkish: MORE DOTS! mstvWax mstvWax mstvWax
[7:27:32] paullydod: @alien1388 it can be frustrating to level in classic and die all the time. it steers ppl away i think
[7:27:37] seafoolol: u dont play wow for graphics
[7:27:38] Xrudee: hes tabbing and still at top of dmg meters LUL
[7:27:39] Thejokerkid: @thebigboomba you get both for the same purchas and sub also you can play retail for free up to level 20
[7:27:42] crispytoast2019: KEKW
[7:27:43] Trollingtko: look at how many people care about cs graphics
[7:27:49] blurTTV: we checking out the new pubg map tomorrow?

[7:28:18] ndras: GTA 6 is all about those huge asses now
[7:28:21] seafoolol: eu server reset in 4min and I wont make it to buy my greater healing potions Sadge
[7:28:47] Xrudee: you can buy pots etc from honored I think
[7:28:49] zanthran: I prefer slightly less modern graphics. I think the amount of work these new graphics take are what make game companies release half finished games b/c of how much work the details and intense graphics take
[7:28:57] YungTrappGodd: what level is this char
[7:29:10] paullydod: @alien1388 keep at it. yes retail can be scary with how many spells and mechanics but addons are a HUGE help and a lot more available for retail
[7:29:18] earache1: !server
