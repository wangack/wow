[2:57:05] kaspaismcspaiss: @SalvDali you dont use holy light on pally?
[2:57:09] loot_ninja_: chain hea;
[2:57:14] HeliosCirce: I had to spice it up by getting a swing timer to watch the boss weap swing to snipe all the heals with holy light
[2:57:17] hwl_mansa: druid seems awful with buff cap. knowing you have buttons you cant pres
[2:57:17] bacconader: gotta bless people
[2:57:17] Cupz21: well priest raid healing was fun on ally
[2:57:20] loot_ninja_: s mana efficiency isn't amazing is the only drawback
[2:57:56] bacconader: From amiis gdkp's it sounds like a pallys only job is to "spam flash of light the tank"
[2:58:24] FlyinHawaiian: ah man, tuned in late to see strimmer with no buffs
[2:58:32] FlyinHawaiian: time to rewind the vod to see where it all went wrong

[2:58:55] HeliosCirce: I literally never used a distilled wisdom outside of early prog on the pally because I just never used mana
[2:59:01] GrohlOfGrobb: @FlyinHawaiian would've had to tune in pretty early to see those :(

[3:12:12] JPand: what items are you still looking for on this char?
[3:12:13] Drast: never seen a wipe
[3:12:31] Biggie6242: I wiped on bough in 2006
[3:12:37] Biggie6242: gluth
[3:12:42] Cupz21: not loot list?
[3:12:50] 451Fireman: epgp is like a ratio between your raids attended / gear received
[3:13:00] loot_ninja_: I remember a Gluth wipe in a Drex GDKP run way back. I wana say he stopped the GDKP right after?
[3:13:01] esfdk: EPGP is really good for dealing with items that people don't get mad about (ie non-bis etc) because it takes the brain out of it for the council so they can focus on important stuff
[3:13:02] jlegretta: if your system doesnt give slayers crest to hunter then it works fine
[3:13:06] Kewzu: loot council is great as long as you are not the council, to much dealing with DM's no matter how you do it
[3:13:06] Nightbot: any good loot drop today guys? Peepocomfy
[3:13:12] FlyinHawaiian: Got those GOA doe
[3:13:54] FlyinHawaiian: YEESSIR
[3:14:08] brodyyyy101: my GM paid for delevopment of EPGP but, everyone hated it, and never used it. Looks like it was successful
[3:14:14] HeliosCirce: yeah if not loot council then I have enjoyed a kind of SR where you get hard reserved on something after a number of weeks of SRing that my guild did
[3:14:29] LadrissTC: i have burned out leading a LC tbh

[3:14:32] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[3:14:33] Kewzu: Loot council for sure the best way to doit, but as a officer/council its alot of effort with no return other than guild getting better
[3:14:34] Nightbot: any good loot drop today guys? Peepocomfy
[3:14:37] samune1: dkp is best for casuel guilds less drama
[3:14:56] Fiskerz: I hate LC because somehow they always get way geared before the rest of the raid LUL
[3:15:03] rogueclassic: dkp is jsut begging to be abused
[3:15:07] Fiskerz: like waaay before
[3:15:18] FlyinHawaiian: did slayers crest just go to a hunter???
[3:15:22] rogueclassic: classes agreeing to lowball tier so they can outbid other classes on multiclass items
[3:15:33] bartonsprings: i heard loot lists are a great system
[3:15:35] bacconader: Imo the real problem with classic is that about 3 people of usable loot drop for a raid with 40 people, theres no system that can fix that
[3:15:41] Kewzu: I always get worse gear when im council, cause its easier to give away items than dealing with it
[3:15:46] bacconader: *3 pieces
[3:16:17] esfdk: A lot of the time people don't wanna be in loot councils, but always know when the LC is wrong :D
[3:16:30] haldaz: Best one ive had is a raid-wide Loot Council. Big items obviously just regular officers doing LC, rest the people up for the item would discuss between themselves or call for LC if they couldnt get to a decision
[3:16:34] Fiskerz: my fav has been SR even though it can be complete shit. can go after the items I want and don‚Äôt have to deal with shady shit
[3:17:39] Bleulaser: @SalvDali Would you agree that the hardest part of making a good breakfast burrito, is wrapping the burrito when you put too much good stuff in it?
[3:17:50] gryphsx: earthstrike grind KEKL
[3:18:04] HeliosCirce: that works fine in a game like vanilla where MC gear can last the whole time basically vs wrath where your whole gearset changes each new tier
[3:18:30] bacconader: Everyone votes for themselves salvdaGz
[3:18:39] brodyyyy101: new LC idea, chat poll loot system .
[3:18:44] GrohlOfGrobb: what kinda tortillas you working with?
[3:18:49] cath0de: You gotta prep the tortilla and make it pliable
[3:18:52] Kewzu: just get a bigger tortilla
[3:18:58] Midiosa: streamer wouldn't know because he didn't make it far enough to wrap the burrito
[3:18:59] Nightbot: Streeeaamerrr!!!1!
[3:19:02] Xibin: we used a LC that rotated 3-4 people in each tier so its was somewhat fair and of course spending the time to teach them whats good and who benefits the most from certain items. Thoughts? @SalvDali
[3:19:29] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[3:19:29] HeliosCirce: with enough elbow grease you can fit whatever you want in the burrito

[3:19:52] Biggie6242: no hot sauce?
