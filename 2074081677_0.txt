[3:47:49] MobiusSt: i like to watch fandy do m+ alongside her of xD
[3:47:52] matgr1993: Twitch is a gaming platform, gamers are usually more sexual frustrated and in more need of sex.. the perfect site for girls to look for subs for the REAL platforms

[4:10:40] Lolsoda: bro blizz must be earning big bucks from bot subs, i totally get it PepegaCredit
[4:10:46] hystelios: Why would you quit a game cause bots? You'd never be able to play any game
[4:10:47] sydale: my theory is that they dont want to deal with false positive bans
[4:10:50] SKNARFN: wow gold worth more than some irl currencies
[4:10:52] SKNARFN: i
[4:11:18] SKNARFN: i’d be botting too

[4:20:17] Traihart: @mania_99 Like a gay sex, but in the game
[4:21:26] pierre1337kappa: i think its dumb removing gdkp's in phase 2 and not in phase 1
[4:21:34] Yoxdaa: exactly botting is still a thing, but with gdkps its bottomless well
[4:22:09] Yoxdaa: atm, why would u need more than 500g on single character total?
[4:24:29] Yoxdaa: + mount
[4:25:01] Yoxdaa: and now with GDKPs 500g would be 3 bis items KEKW

[6:58:47] of_valinor: wildly different options
[6:58:54] lord_windir: Whats the best way to trigger you, @Lmgd1 ?
[6:58:55] of_valinor: wowheads guide will work for leveling but arent current
[6:59:05] psykfall69: boris why did u not do the HC OTK tourney
[6:59:15] psykfall69: u know payo got best rogue XD
[6:59:16] of_valinor: that deep destro imp imp meta guide with full imp searing pain
[6:59:21] of_valinor: is great youll have no complaints
[6:59:34] of_valinor: also do crazy damage as tank and often spike to 1
[6:59:59] of_valinor: downside - always tapping and drinking, dont have imp tap, no hoices anywhere
[7:00:05] of_valinor: rigid rotation
[7:00:11] of_valinor: global starved lol
[7:00:25] of_valinor: essentially its the try hard and it works gud, do reccomend
[7:00:36] gdkpgold: yep i just got 4 items yesterday that way
[7:00:42] of_valinor: ?
[7:00:46] of_valinor: wym
[7:00:51] of_valinor: so the other tank
[7:00:53] of_valinor: oh yeah
[7:01:01] of_valinor: i thought u meant in talents
[7:01:09] buck_nazty: the woman singing sounds hot
[7:01:13] gdkpgold: even needed on  chicken the otherday
[7:01:17] of_valinor: and the simple rot is straight up incinerate and immolate
[7:01:25] of_valinor: run in dropping lof
[7:01:27] of_valinor: then hellfire
[7:01:56] of_valinor: but when you start spreading immolates and weaving in CoE or CoR its pretty global starved
[7:02:01] of_valinor: yeh
[7:02:02] of_valinor: or
[7:02:06] of_valinor: concerning mobs
[7:02:11] of_valinor: massive buff
[7:02:17] of_valinor: like i said this is the big dam build
[7:02:20] of_valinor: you pull with it
[7:02:22] gdkpgold: you only need it fo 2 last bosses , the channeler
[7:02:25] of_valinor: do it right mobs die before buff falls
[7:02:52] of_valinor: its the multiplicative fire dam buffs that spike destro to the top of logs
[7:03:08] Sharrak0r: lake of fire and incinerate are pure dps/threat options
[7:03:17] of_valinor: my friends and guild bitch at me all the time for running mas chann
[7:03:18] gdkpgold: iam more of a cuck specc enjoyer using demnoc pact
[7:03:23] of_valinor: but the quality of life is sooo good
[7:03:30] of_valinor: yeah dont take it
[7:03:36] of_valinor: nah
[7:03:37] of_valinor: not really
[7:03:41] of_valinor: a bit
[7:03:49] qwafflesnsyrup: its not bad
[7:03:52] of_valinor: but master channel is great
[7:03:57] of_valinor: the Quality of life is the best
[7:04:01] of_valinor: never ending mana
[7:04:34] of_valinor: and youll go from 1 or 2 in logs to like 4 prolly. still for bosses tho u can compete for the top cause bolt
[7:04:43] of_valinor: aff also pumps dont let anyone tell u other wise
[7:04:46] of_valinor: its an options
[7:04:49] gdkpgold: u can run lake of fire only when ur healers are not dog
[7:05:12] of_valinor: or youre good and have stone and cookie
[7:05:16] of_valinor: use your sac well
[7:05:23] of_valinor: cause its ecpensive
[7:05:25] of_valinor: gotta tap lots
[7:05:35] gdkpgold: yes
[7:05:36] of_valinor: he means as a tank im assuming
[7:05:38] hujehah: hey, on which server do u playing?
[7:05:49] of_valinor: but if u really doin it you are hellfiring too
[7:05:59] of_valinor: make that healer sweat lol
[7:06:17] of_valinor: and with all the buffs up master channeler compensates beautifully for hellfire damage
[7:06:20] of_valinor: honestly evens out
[7:06:21] psykfall69: give us wotlk affli and sp pls cba playing shadow mage
[7:06:47] gdkpgold: bruv pushback on hellfire is so annoying
[7:06:54] of_valinor: ive been begging on oevery post

[10:50:29] RizzL: Buying a house is a decent investment over renting, renting you pay someone elses mortgage rather than paying your own
[10:50:29] itzescalati0n: it basicly depends on the country you live in, in germany you have to pay lots of taxes if you sell it after 5 years and didnt even live in it

[10:50:59] Tactics_lol: If you rent out apartment and its 2k. But same size if you buy is 400. Then you still make 1600 a month + value of it that it goes up by. Now if you need to take loan for it ofc it changes things (almost everyone needs too)
[10:51:49] Tactics_lol: 400$ a month if u buy. 2000 a month if you rent
[10:51:57] Tactics_lol: So even if you live in it you still "make" 1600 a month
