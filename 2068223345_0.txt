[6:41:32] Fludens: arcane surge still hits for 2.4k and one shots
[6:41:33] septictankforpoop: What would you do if you were in a street fight and your opponent starts jerking you off while he's got you in a headlock @Graycen
[6:41:34] Thomsan04: if you want unlimited mana just play retail
[6:41:38] Dalbo420: True im fine in everything but pvp, I go oom so fast pvping, all my utility is super expensive

[6:42:43] crucialhead: Have a chat to Xaryu my dawg
[6:42:45] 555artur: @BingoTingler retail has no concept of classes either KEKG they might as well just remove mana from retail altogether
[6:42:45] Neonbonkers: U are kinda cute when ranting

[6:42:50] Tehghost66512: rogue cant get mana
[6:42:53] adam_brisbane: so you would take 10% damage deduction for the mana issue?
[6:42:55] BingoTingler: mana feels not great on my boomkin but innervate at 40 will hopefully offset that
[6:42:57] CookieClickerLegend: yeah but those all cost a gcd

[6:45:52] grubols: @ducksmoke_ not in pvp lol melee hunter hits for 1k 😂
[6:45:56] GoodGuyEli74: I never cared about them nerfing hunter pets I think they should of nerfed them more but after nerfing explosive shot/chimera within 24 hours of luanch
[6:45:56] Messn3r: take his crit away

[6:46:30] GoodGuyEli74: idk why they wont revert it its dog shit
[6:46:38] GoodGuyEli74: no one played it
[6:46:42] draqcula: hunters are the punching bag class when the meta is not balanced
[6:46:43] IRL_Papi: Kermit: graycen. now you mages can feel the pain of healers. we slave over here spamming heals on you idiots while wasting our precious mana to keep you all alive just to complain that your loot didn’t drop or that you ran out of mana. YAPPING
[6:46:47] limestwitch: casters are stupid rn they ruined the game before level 60 what a good company
[6:46:56] Decoyduck: @Jelerman that cat is frieeedddd
[6:47:11] sumblackdude: Lol truùuuuue

[6:47:34] GoodGuyEli74: retail -
[6:47:38] limestwitch: like 20 people i know quit phase 2 because its dog shit
[6:47:40] Fludens: SoD is their best product right now, everything else is on fire
[6:47:43] dudeshamus: @GoodGuyEli74 When can you get the melee specialist rune for hunter?
[6:47:50] crucialhead: GUYS SOD IS GREAT
[6:47:50] DuckSmoke_: You're complaining that you have to stop to drink even though you plow through mobs faster than almost every other class. The time you spend oom is the balance for doing high dps
[6:47:50] EFFSIN: Dust 2 dust gnomer
[6:47:52] Thomsan04: SoD is just the 5th iteration of them trying to keep vanilla relevant
[6:48:02] 123cain: I unsubbed because this phase felt boring for me
[6:48:14] GoodGuyEli74: @dudeshamus its from dark riders idk if they have a level requirement but the mobs are 40 elites
[6:48:18] heyimnotmayo: i like p2 stv event, just not alot to do in p2.
[6:48:19] BerkTheLUL: @limestwitch what do they play now
[6:48:20] Jelerman: last phase of sod will be poggers
[6:48:22] limestwitch: 200 SP at level 40 is balanced? getting stronger gear just for them to upscale molten core? constant fucking with balance? its shit
[6:48:22] happycorgixd: i quit too, not as good as i thought it would be
[6:48:24] keysersoze_taken: @123cain its so much more fun than p1 what?
[6:48:26] EFFSIN: give him a port
