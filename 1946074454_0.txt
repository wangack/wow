He's starting using terms like "pog","jabaited", and "kappa,” but its gotten to the point where every sentence is Twitchspeak. At dinner my daughter was talking about how she got accepted to college, and my son said "pog you, easy clap". I told him to talk normally to his family, and he replied "Weird champ, normies omegaLOL." I blacklisted twitch and now my son is hysterical, whatodo Waiting

[2:33:05] Ali1331: If you die on HC you should get a buff item to speed levelling the next char to the level you died at, just to keep people playing. But you get a permanent debuff to say it’s your 2nd/3rd char or something
