[1:32:31] Smith6612: The vaccination site I got my shot at has the national guard there
[1:32:33] SuperDyu: Cheer100  The slow start was because Japan requested domestic clinical trials in addition to Pfizer Inc.’s testing in other countries.  Dozens of nations accepted the results of Pfizer’s multinational tests released in November and began vaccinations. The additional testing in Japan took extra months, though the government then took just two months to grant its approval for the vaccine, much faster than the typical one year.
[1:32:34] StreamElements: SuperDyu just cheered 100 bits PogChamp
[1:32:40] pewtanblot: @SuperDyu jnbSalute
[1:32:45] golaki: @Smith6612  salute your troops :P
[1:32:51] SuperDyu: ... I just googled it and found an AP news article lol
[1:33:13] codeyfang4y: still gay right?
[1:33:15] Saiavakie: national guard ??
[1:33:20] azncheesy: The slow start doesnt explain how they are still slow now
[1:33:24] CallMeDoubleYou: Japan did not begin inoculating its residents until mid-February, roughly two months after the first vaccines were approved and distributed in the United States and other major countries. The delay stemmed in part from Japan's desire to conduct clinical trials with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on its own soil, rather than accept international data.
[1:33:26] CallMeDoubleYou: basically
[1:33:32] SynthRiffs: Also they at first said they had home grown, and that fail.
[1:33:32] CallMeDoubleYou: tried to do it all themselves
[1:33:52] Numenone: Hey Jake, what's your opinion on the upcoming South American Cup Tournament (soccer)? Should it be canceled?
[1:33:54] TriBoneHardo: winnie jnbAw
[1:34:01] SuperDyu: According to the article there is a lot of vaccine skepticism within Japan that bubbled up to the government.  In 1990 they scrapped mandatory inoclutations
[1:34:02] montereyjakku: their bureaucracy is so ridiculous
[1:34:17] selpheq: It is going super slow/  Just ask people trying to get an appointment last couple of months.  They essentially had a "first come first serve" website where you had to hope and pray you could get in and book an appointment before the website crashed or all the appointments were gone.

[1:35:12] OniiJabroniChan: I like the one dude's take, like they aren't going to benefit really economically since fans cant travel to come see, so they're not getting anything out of it really, other than hosting it at a risk.
[1:35:25] montereyjakku: i heard the other day that 10k volunteer workers withdrew from working in the olympics
[1:35:27] Saiavakie: almost 69 Sadge

[1:36:02] bigdog_x: they dont make a profit if fans are allowed to go
[1:36:34] fzomka: hopefully the vaccination process will be exponential
[1:36:43] selpheq: I think every host country loses money on the Olympics anyway; it has always been more about the recognition
[1:36:44] gritz_n_pitz: Japan godd Cucked
[1:36:47] CallMeDoubleYou: Shihoko Goto, a senior Northeast Asia associate at the Woodrow Wilson Center's Asia Program, said she believes that Japan didn't rush to approve a vaccine this winter in part because it had largely been able to keep COVID-19 under control.
[1:36:48] gritz_n_pitz: Got
[1:36:54] bigdog_x: Olympics are truly a money vacuum and kind of worthless, considering what countrys spend on them while ignoring glaring issues
[1:36:59] TriBoneHardo: too many old farts in charge of government
[1:37:00] lazerlemons: Olympic contract's are so shitty
[1:37:03] fzomka: kinda not fair
[1:37:08] Gruumzh: if the boomers at the olympic committee going to fine japan for cancelling amongst this pandemic the boomers should be reorganized
[1:37:09] SynthRiffs: That's why many countries use it to do PR and know they lose money.
