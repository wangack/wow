[2:07:20] Samaellus: you need to like tje playstile
[2:07:22] suvati68: Yeah
[2:07:30] jaynkumz: I'd say this it's not complicated but the dispersion between playing feral and say playing feral competitively in like mythic prog is insane.
[2:07:31] nibaw_: ijpNODDERS
[2:07:33] 91Niki: @Towelliee I mean true to a sense. But despite being "at the bottom" feral can still top meters if you know how to play .
[2:07:34] anticensor_: yea harder playstyle have to be rewarding not same as one button class
[2:07:39] ThrasiusGG: because it isn't that high a skill ceiling, everyone would end up rolling feral
[2:07:42] ratpac34: good morning all !!
[2:07:45] Rulem: feral becomes much easier with good WAs
[2:07:50] hateful88: thats because historically they have become insanely broken in pvp
[2:08:02] 91Niki: I still know, that NO feral would trade 3 buttons for topping meters.
[2:08:02] fewyn: remember when hunters used to spam just steady shot
[2:08:08] itsbananas01: Sadge true
[2:08:11] yeahuhh: piss ass ULUL

[2:08:25] suvati68: Sadge but true
[2:08:32] Nokterian: convoke is the best
[2:08:44] sabernn: if feral was a more reliable spec every expansion/tier i could see myself maining it. its unreliability makes me not want to go near it
[2:08:46] vikutoru11: @towelliee you missed dawn_myst prime sub :)

[2:16:37] TotallyNotRaien: it should be bar 1
[2:16:39] AggroDPS: NoBarChange Addon
[2:16:40] TheItalianStallion321: druid has a change of bars i think every single form
[2:16:40] iblighters: shred is the "filler" you keep up rake and thrash, then at 5 cp use rip if it's not up and bite if it is or isn't about to fall off @Towelliee
[2:16:48] CrunkyBrewster: thats the annoying thing about druid for me. the bar management
[2:16:49] TotallyNotRaien: the only bar that changes is bar 1 the rest dont
[2:17:05] 91Niki: Stealth open with rake, shred single target combo builder, swipe +4 enemies combo builder, use rip at full combo points, keep rake and rip dot up, bite on full combo, keep thrash dot up if more than 4 enemies
[2:17:15] sabernn: bite/rip are your spenders
[2:17:29] shadowghostytv: how do you have mouse button 4 and 5 on a 12 button mouse @Towelliee
[2:17:39] TheItalianStallion321: ferocious bite is another good spender
[2:17:40] jaynkumz: dont bars change again in stealth?
[2:17:43] Arendiel_: dont forget swipe
[2:18:12] TarMonA: passive should have it own tab
[2:18:34] deadxarrival: do you have current addons for retail?
[2:18:35] Strouss: maim
[2:18:38] sabernn: ferocious bite
[2:18:40] Arendiel_: ferocious bite
[2:18:41] iblighters: replace shred with swipe in 4+ targets
[2:18:41] TheItalianStallion321: ferocious bite
[2:18:42] nibaw_: ferocious bite
[2:18:46] mewkittymon: Bite
[2:18:48] MajurDJ: shred/swipe are your fillers, ST/AOE, rake and thrash are your bleeds to keep up, again ST/AOE
[2:18:55] 91Niki: @Towelliee Stealth open with rake, shred single target combo builder, swipe +4 enemies combo builder, use rip at full combo points, keep rake and rip dot up, bite on full combo, keep thrash dot up if more than 4 enemies
[2:19:05] sabernn: top right general book
[2:19:44] mattjee1: need regrowth for CC procs
[2:20:00] sabernn: yeah prowl is stealth
[2:20:16] 91Niki: yeah prowl doesn't change your bars
[2:20:19] TheItalianStallion321: prowl should change your bars, at least the main 1
[2:20:20] maalow: regrowth for procs
[2:20:23] jaynkumz: I swear it used to but could have been my bar addon
[2:20:31] LearnedSomething: maybe your first bar isn't your first bar
[2:20:36] TheItalianStallion321: or it used to at least
[2:20:38] llNoTToXiCll: ravenous fury and regrowth
[2:20:48] 91Niki: It doesn't change your bars
[2:20:58] overshot14: Is the new profession ui working?

[2:22:49] 91Niki: @DallDK ijpHI
[2:22:59] Arendiel_: mangle
[2:23:08] jaynkumz: yeah
[2:23:14] 91Niki: Only with the talent
[2:23:14] sabernn: if u owlweave i think
[2:23:18] lexxprime: for pull perhaps
[2:23:23] iblighters: not unless you took lunar
[2:23:45] DallTV_: xD
[2:23:57] nibaw_: if you have to go out of melee from the boss you might as well press moonfire, also sometimes you are so energy starved you have nothing else to press either way
[2:24:11] Scoodles91: actualy i wouldnt mind maul for feral, that gives you something to press in bear
[2:24:15] iblighters: that what my binds are as well
[2:24:20] 91Niki: @Towelliee you can change that in your keybinds
[2:24:22] billybaggens: Do you ever actually use maul anyway
[2:24:30] 91Niki: Bind it to your shapeshift bars
[2:24:41] TotallyNotRaien: the new bear tree has a lot of maul talents
[2:24:46] iblighters: delete maul
[2:24:48] Eshel: Head up - you have moonfire on your bars twice
[2:24:48] Snabido: towCopium
[2:24:51] LegoCoin: towCopium
[2:25:19] pent217: Couldn't you just keybind the stance bar so they never go away?
[2:25:21] Eshel: Bear form you added a second moonfire#l
[2:25:23] billybaggens: Rave-bear is so fun on beta
[2:25:55] odtee: I miss my cat, off wow for 2 years
[2:25:58] papaherc: you watching the texas alabama game?
[2:26:00] TotallyNotRaien: moonfire
[2:26:11] 91Niki: @Towelliee Basic rotation: "Stealth open with rake, shred single target combo builder, swipe +4 enemies combo builder, use rip at full combo points, keep rake and rip dot up, bite on full combo, keep thrash dot up if more than 4 enemies". That's without cds like convoke, tigers fury and beserk. Which for leveling, just use it when you feel like it.
[2:26:15] billybaggens: Galactic guardian build
[2:26:20] notdustinx: !DF
[2:26:26] PToastman: zappybear

[2:26:59] LearnedSomething: bear necesseties
[2:27:04] iblighters: we are locked into one build
[2:27:05] xmirrxrs: They should have more than one option though. Galactic bear shouldnt be the only viable options
[2:27:06] Rulem: still boring af
[2:27:09] ArcaneMaki: just boring
[2:27:16] billybaggens: If anything blood dk needs love
[2:27:21] JustVek: supposed to be basic tanking spec

[2:29:57] HairClog: I miss the concept of corruption. Add affixes as a tradeoff for dps or whatever. Was cool
[2:30:04] billybaggens: Imo guardian feels amazing the healing you get from moon fire on top of all the damage you do arguably one of the best builds they have had since legion

[3:07:25] Rulem: ticket
[3:07:25] DisparagingTurtle: i thought it was level 55 to be able to make a DK
[3:07:26] spiked16: you need a lvl 55 in order to create a dk
[3:07:28] baffle__: you can make a DSK on any of the old server without haveing a 70
[3:07:32] aribellae: Luxthos said there was a glitch messing some people up, the way around it is just to make a level 1 on the server and then make the dk
[3:07:37] nibaw_: get the hippo feral ui wa, it's not cursed i promise
[3:07:39] baffle__: however you cannot make a dks without a 70 on the fresh
[3:07:51] tamer_bayne: i didnt even make it past lvl 15 on classic an i was able to make a dk

[3:08:12] OhHiImRob: you ONLY need a 55 on one of the new fresh servers.. there is no requirement for the other servers..
[3:08:14] Arendiel_: no, only the double clawed rake
[3:08:17] Scoodles91: rake
[3:08:18] Rulem: my account must be bugged, then

[4:26:03] ArchHere: They've said that 'simpler' play styles should be less optimal
[4:26:07] LearnedSomething: spinning plates style gameplay
[4:26:23] Siddydiddydo: the skill based gameplay is the only reason to play feral, you'll just get sat for the boomkin anyway lol

[4:26:50] LearnedSomething: keep your rake, thrash, rip and savage roar up and snapshotted to your tiger's fury while you shred and bite :)
[4:26:55] Siddydiddydo: facts
[4:27:31] bushmaster03: That new loot UI looks nice
[4:27:40] karanloss: Is feral smashing?
[4:27:49] Siddydiddydo: feral charge/leap
[4:28:17] Lokdannin: wrath classic has it :)
[4:28:24] Siddydiddydo: They still have it in retail, it's like a tier 30 talent
[4:28:29] Daccard: pounce got rolled into stealth rake stun
[4:28:31] karanloss: wasn't it merged with wild charge
[4:28:39] Siddydiddydo: Oh that pounce, my bad
[4:28:59] LearnedSomething: pounce was cheap shot yeah

[4:29:02] Daccard: pounce = cheap shot
[4:29:04] Dolas08: center of class talent tree is the leap ?
[4:29:18] Siddydiddydo: The best part of being feral is the 140% move speed, if you stand in fire as a feral youre just bad
[4:29:34] Siddydiddydo: thats it
[4:29:44] Siddydiddydo: Wild charge is the leap
[4:29:47] Broseidon7624: thats wild charge, not pounce
[4:29:50] Sasooka: Feral's problem is the fact Balance exists. Why bring a Feral when Balance provides the same benefits while being ranged.
[4:29:56] karanloss: Talents are looking good but missing something to bring a feral for that the other 3 specs don't bring, like a party buff that other specs have gotten
[4:29:57] Daccard: pounce and wild charge are different things
[4:29:57] Xelim27: i play feral, new talents and classs feels fun imo, specially after the talent tree changes.
[4:30:00] Sasooka: Then you bring better melee specs who bring more.
[4:30:09] Daccard: pounce is the stun, charge is just a charge
[4:30:19] loodytoons: How did you get details to work on beta? Doesnt work for me

[4:35:59] chriscrumbs17: I was going to take a pass on this expansion, but that skill tree‚Ä¶
[4:36:19] JakeyyyGee: And Evoker!
[4:36:39] zeeAbe: WoD prepatch was super funky because they did the raid size changes which turned SoO into a complete joke lul
[4:36:40] Xelim27: pre-patch > shadowlands
[4:36:57] Waswat: Haven't played WoW for 5 years, good to see it still looks like shit :) j/k
[4:37:12] Xelim27: ill feel out of shadowlands since my class will have new toys to play with and the covenants abilities will not work
[4:37:14] Aidler: wow. I could not do this

[4:38:42] MrFuzzynuts420: please god no WutFace
[4:38:43] karanloss: But "knowledge is powder" man is back
[4:38:49] SlippieSlik: lol similar to not seeing Kadghar until a little side note at the end lol
[4:38:54] TheCliffyShow: Anduin shouldn't show back up until after Turalyon goes super light dictator mode.
[4:39:00] SlippieSlik: we needed the break from him lol
[4:39:15] UltraContent: syulvanas and andwing get both eated by some nasty dragon
[4:39:20] silversoidier: I have a problem making too many alts and wanting to play them all.. trying to pick something I will love to play constantly is extremely difficult
[4:39:45] abracka_: khadgar be sounding like a 80 year old grandpa
[4:39:48] TotallyNotRaien: of course anduin is absent when wrathion is in the spotlight... blizzard doesnt have the balls to make them a real couple like god intended
[4:39:53] goodguyyjoe: Still going to main pally in DF?
[4:40:07] jarilrpg: do we have dadgar puns at max level world quests?
[4:40:25] MrDakiris: Yeah, I have one of each class, and I'm excited to try them all with the new talent trees.
[4:40:31] bushmaster03: Any druids here? What do you think about resto druid heart of the wild convoke in boomkin form

[4:40:39] Nokterian: i love these kind of challenges
[4:40:43] karanloss: I liked mage tower because I actually got to play specs I don't usually play because of borrowed power and gearing issues
[4:40:50] Buzzz_Light_Beer: Nice skyscale
[4:40:58] Aidler: there is no way i will ever be able to do this race
[4:41:00] zorantt: @MrDakiris You can play with the talent trees on the PTR right now (only up to level 60 though)
[4:41:12] TheCliffyShow: We don't know for sure if the whole switching Malfurion for Ysera thing even works. Or if Blizzard is even going with that idea at all. He could be abandoned left overs.
[4:41:20] ADVANCEDgg: @Towelliee Hope you've been well <3 <3 <3 and lol
[4:41:42] Nokterian: 4 players i think
[4:41:55] vischasbaver: its does the race with 3 players
[4:42:06] vischasbaver: i did it last night

[4:44:14] Youredoneson666: its only like 45 minutes into the xpac. i don't see a problem doing it again
[4:44:27] skittlesman09: nope your missing some
[4:44:27] SlippieSlik: the quest line is a small price to have all the points available honestly...not to mention free small amount of gold
[4:44:30] MrFuzzynuts420: still better than waiting till the second patch of expac for flying i'd say
[4:44:38] skittlesman09: my pally has all points

[4:48:59] Jarlan23: you play with any dps warriors? curious how theyre doing
[4:48:59] zorantt: @Towelliee In your opinion, do you think the pre patch is roughly on point with the rumored date a few weeks ago? (Think it was aroudn Oct 16?)
[4:49:06] epikouros_kathigitis: on bear or prot warrior better tuning happened?

[4:50:50] yaashs: its gonna be the first thing i do atleast
[4:51:21] Youredoneson666: Theres ALOT of NYI on the PTR
[4:51:30] happybooger: prot pallies still need some lovin
[4:51:33] Youredoneson666: But i think the PTR is a old build
[4:51:48] Jarlan23: i think theres still a couple on warriors thats still WIP but i could be wrong
[4:51:51] 3663Sharad: Evoker will have a hard time during pre-ptach. NO T-Set, no tuning in a live enviroment etc
[4:52:04] manmower: work orders are in the game?
[4:52:32] yaashs: Still a lot to do for blizz
[4:52:36] DevilSpire: Man we should of said classic feral for today üòÇüòÇ
[4:52:49] Dolas08: @3663Sharad same as dh back in legion prepatch
[4:53:30] Jarlan23: ? is it gonna take months to get mastery?
[4:53:43] MrFuzzynuts420: LUL
[4:53:44] Celestia6: I want to play with the new profession system so bad
[4:53:44] yaashs: im leveling mining and BS in the Beta now
[4:54:06] TheCliffyShow: Doesn't help some of the professoion trainers take a while to find. I was three chapters into the Waking Shores campaign before finding a Jewelcrafting guy.
[4:54:15] tyler2tall89: I mean id have a hard time grinding out professions on alpha/beta only to turn around and do it again on retail a month or so later. fuck that
[4:54:16] zorantt: Do beta players roughly know how many profession knowledge you get?
[4:54:18] WarsickLive: WHATS Ur favorite dps spec in dragonflight
[4:55:17] Blackicedragoon: Just got my AdvancedGG on the Bday. Took awhile to get here.
[4:55:28] epikouros_kathigitis: do you expect bear changes?
[4:56:09] DevilSpire: Do you know if gathering bots will be a problem in DF?
[4:56:12] zorantt: I'll order Advancedgg for DF launch. It's just too expensive to ship to Canada lol
[4:56:40] JakeyyyGee: Aren't Evokers centered around the fact they have so much mobility that it's a trade off for range?
[4:57:31] WSquiggle12: Thats the plan for me also lol I did the same for the old stuff when that 30% code came in

[4:58:42] LearnedSomething: they're pretty good
[4:58:53] mesokprime: do you still workout you looks buffed
[4:59:12] JakeyyyGee: Yeah I suppose, I guess with the new raids they need to find a way to make that movement playstyle almost a necessity. Maybe that'll feed bad for all other content though idk
[5:00:09] manmower: it should autopopulate based on the price of the AH mats
[5:00:13] Hronak: @Towelliee how do you feel the endgame is dragonflight?
[5:00:13] Xelim27: wait arent the mats urs?
[5:00:21] 3663Sharad: Looks like a fun system. Hopefully the goblins won't break it to hard
[5:00:42] Xelim27: cuz is the item is created with UR mats, ur tip doesnt have to be that high O.o
[5:00:46] zorantt: Think this has been answered but are work orders server specific or region wide?
[5:00:50] itsDets: think their focus rn is leveling procces and talents

[5:01:17] xirroxis: Enchanting:::???
[5:01:44] 3663Sharad: @zorantt shpuld be server, since new AH is only "material focused" not gear
[5:02:07] skymercii: morning Towelliee towHAMUP
[5:02:10] Rudric_Ice: do u think people will sell  dragon riding boosts to unlock all the upgrades ? bcuz im thinking of it
[5:02:26] TheUnknowing: wasn't like legion a total of 9 months of testing? idk it was something crazy
[5:02:26] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[5:02:37] Xelim27: targeted testing for alpha was good, i feel this was a good alpha/beta,, how do u feel towellieee

[5:04:49] Clicklesly: If you have a passenger on the mount do they get the achiev too?
[5:05:10] Molvonos: That legit sounds like a horrible waste of everyone's time.  Like, I can see Torg being a thing back in SL, but glyphs?
[5:05:52] Rudric_Ice: i mean people pay for lvling so i dont see why not
[5:06:18] JakeyyyGee: Yeah especially considering it's account-wide too. Do it once and that's it.
[5:06:34] happybooger: @Clicklesly thats a great question, i wonder if anyone has tested it
[5:06:47] JakeyyyGee: This is their new version of time-gating, making you wait for vigor lol
[5:06:56] Unciatim: well.. thats life... if it wasnt' difficult in some way... they might as well give it all with the first quest
[5:07:22] matthewkshearer: they get the glyph if they fly through it while following
[5:07:25] Clicklesly: Really what bothers me most is the pet behaviour with dragonriding, still have to try it with lock if demons despawn too...
[5:07:51] justntimee: got my ADV! do yall prefer focus or energy?
