[1:46:54] OathXP: really praying they tune appropriately for 4pc and double lego
[1:47:00] xXSiebzehnXx: I think double legendaries is more dynamic and it shoulda launched 9.1, the legendary combinations with conduits for some classes are bonkers
[1:47:17] Aquadriel: i enjoy max takes but, most of them are RWF focused (which makes sense), but when he means 'smashed' he talks about the top 3 guilds. The rest of the player base will greatly struggle with it.

[1:50:32] KaisenSiru: Power Overwhelming

[1:50:41] alex12645: tell they get mythic+ gear then just wipe the raid
[1:51:06] xXSiebzehnXx: Stuff like that should be exact. Since 8.2 it‚Äôs been slipping back to more rng before tier starts
[1:51:32] dracullus: owned by people like him, not regular people that play 2-3 evenings per week
[1:51:42] TheGaoSora: @Alepouditsa ngl that's pretty nice to know, as someone who started in 7.2 and took a brake around 9.0 it always felt like it's only being catered for the veteran players

[1:53:17] ace0gg: lets be honest, the people clearing  top end content is probably like 1% of the player base. they need to take a leaf from classic, where everyone is able to raid the same mode and is at the same level unless you wana speed run. As things are people outside the 1% dont want to do 10k different phase boss fights with 50 diff mechanics

[1:54:04] Alepouditsa: @TheOmniSora the thing i liked was about wq in bfa that i needed to do all of them! all day omost i was working on that to get fly i loved that in this expesions tho there was nothing like that for me and it makes me bored
[1:54:28] Aquadriel: he usually mostly talks about the RWF players @Towelliee
[1:54:34] mrrazputin: Painsmith got super nerfed at the time you went on brake and next 3 bossess were a lot easyer than painsmith
[1:55:04] FranciscoTheMage: thats why i sighed @Towelliee because again here's the 1-5 percent attempting to dictate the state of the game because its suits them
[1:55:21] Wcvechten: I'd be okay if mythic was tuned around double leggo + 4pc

[1:55:58] manmower: single legendary for the mythic race, then the double legendary is like baked in raid nerfing that they normally do
[1:55:59] Kinghorn: except it doesnt suit them? FranciscoTheMage they will have it cleared before the player power is acquired
[1:56:12] ace0gg: yeah the top 1% will clear the raids and then the top 1% will sell boosts to everyone else, really good design
[1:56:18] AngelsMatt: at this point is more like devs vs players
[1:56:22] Kinghorn: they will kill it before 4 piece and 2 leggos
[1:56:24] CrossThread: @Towelliee hey bro.. what rare spawn addon do you use? i have spent so much time in deepholm and its killin me
[1:56:27] Aquadriel: @Towelliee people talk about how dom shards helped demolish SoD, and is true at a CE level. Yet Heroic and AoTC was a bitch to get for the majority of player base even WITH full dom shards.
[1:56:37] TheGaoSora: @Alepouditsa they changed it because there's so many times you can grind reps in order to get flying, and it started back in WoD where you had other achievements besides rep and zone discovery which was terrible enough to do..
[1:56:43] ttmaker: I enjoyed WoD more than SL Sadge
[1:56:47] hikaritd: @ttmaker "big" villain... Titan++ defeated by mortals.. the whole lore is a clownfiesta

[2:11:17] phantom0803: I wouldnt even call it the middle ground, they need to make quality content, and if that result isnt made for everyone then its not for everyone, if you only get 1 hour of game time a week, you dont get to be on the same par as the rest of the game

Start thinking on your self to get this or stop playing wow. You dont linke raiding,m+ or Rated PVP? Stop asking for the rewards and be lucky that you can get things like tiersets and legys whitout grinding this content. WoW never rewarded people for doing nothing.

[2:19:01] phantom0803: the release was amazing even with all its fuck ups. Nathria was great raid good content. Just get tired of the same content for 9 months. Like you said give us 4-5 months of cycles it would make any expansion better even if they released this exact content

[6:52:23] alex12645: LUL
[6:52:25] Jarwerewolf: do it
[6:52:27] UnProfessionalsLLC: I want more content with alliance wolf guy
[6:52:29] trailerparkkgamer: thrall VA sucks
[6:52:43] zoovthepally: The Jailer sucks as a villain now but I hope they dont kill him. I think he could be much more interesting after being humbled and now focusing his retribution on us.
[6:52:44] arturiuss44: Thrall chose to stop speaking with the elements for his family I believe so maybe he could get back in touch with elements in 10.0
[6:52:51] Ziyololx: Helya is send back to her own place by the Primus
[6:52:55] DxDamn: @towelliee i think primus just 1 shotted helya
[6:52:58] OhNoNotAgain: Primus locks her ass away, told her "Begone thot"
[6:53:02] happybooger: she was also in the maw intro quest
[6:53:05] Joneeeez: have you ever thought about jailor has a mission from the pantheons, to mess with the whole world haha xD
[6:53:12] flebbooo: I just want Thrall stop being so butthurt over killing Garrosh LUL
[6:53:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: THe queues are short for that
[6:53:17] DxDamn: Yea but when we killed that traitor primus 1 shotted her
[6:53:41] SyWr: @arturiuss44 the elements stopped speaking to thrall cause of his actions
[6:53:43] CardinalTX: We need something drastically different.
[6:53:59] TheUnknowing: pantheon is whatever and they aren't supposed to be bad so they wouldn't work with the jailer
[6:54:03] dalaraz: we need illidan back and that lore chapter to end,like now
[6:54:10] Bezroth: My idea is the in the final fight with the Jailer the sword is destroyed leaving a path into the core of Azeroth where there is a giant cavern with multiple zone which orbit the sleeping world soul, these zones are untouched by the Titans/Old Gods.
[6:54:12] flebbooo: Primal Sargeras!
[6:54:13] arturiuss44: @SyWr that's right forgot,been awhile thx
[6:54:27] DxDamn: @towelliee there is a certain bellu video that is pretty cool theory about the new expansion direction from a while ago
[6:54:39] arturiuss44: Azeroth slaps a restraining order on Jailer for stalking her expansion done.
[6:54:44] Lazugo: its not their problem
[6:54:49] Lazugo: Its not zereth ordos
[6:54:53] Vch001: Illidan can't drive which is why their taking so long
[6:54:54] Lazugo: its zerith morthis
[6:54:56] Xirmak: pantheon had the forsight to see that shadowlands sucks and decided we good not going
[6:55:01] billybaroo1: who wins the Bengals Raiders game?
[6:55:01] GivTater: I love theory crafting.
[6:55:17] valianya: Doing Legion invasion is a pain in the arse for 60s, but worse for leveling through chromie because they turned off group finder for lower level characters
[6:55:18] Roaringkittylol: Friendship lazer beam imo

[6:55:40] TheHoboWithAShotgun: I wish theyd massively expand world PvP make main city attacks dooable even have world evennts where big name NPCs join the attacks   tbh BFA shouldve been That
[6:55:41] SyWr: @Towelliee dont forget the prophesies of illgynoth
[6:55:45] zoovthepally: what about nzoth won and tricked us into thinking he lost theory and we get back from the shadowlands and the old gods took over and the void expanision begins

[6:58:12] luckfore: when legion timewalking was up you were able to buy 250 rep tokens from timewalk vendor, sadly its not coming up for a while
[6:58:14] UnProfessionalsLLC: @Towelliee     So are you playing PTR atm, and How do you feel about the rep of new area?
[6:58:17] xaezoria: why u doing legion thingis`?
[6:58:31] dalaraz: @UnProfessionalsLLC its not ptr,its legion
[6:58:50] QuigsTV: @Towelliee i got a bunch of paragon chests during legion timewalking. Ended up getting the rest of the mounts
[6:59:11] DxDamn: @towelliee what you think, dragon isles or army of the light and what ideas you would have for botu of these directions‚Ä¶?
[6:59:11] TheHoboWithAShotgun: They need to do something massive and fundamentally change gameplay   cool story new zones fun but this leak about maps possibly turning from a desert into a forest looks innovative  as long as it not change once and that it
[6:59:12] KnsWoW: walk on magical water..
[6:59:15] luckfore: yea the paragon mounts have a very high drop chance now
[6:59:16] UnProfessionalsLLC: Lots of people are already putting out time frames for how much rep per day/week you can get.
[6:59:29] TheHoboWithAShotgun: Make wow feel no
[6:59:29] flebbooo: Just another day in Timeless isle 5 POGGERS
[6:59:35] Alexkayzz: YOU CAN WALK ON WATER!
[6:59:37] UnProfessionalsLLC: Conduit power is the weakest.  I think peeps are most mad that dual leggo is tied to Rep grind
[6:59:53] valianya: I don't think the idea is true that Zovaal is a 12head 8th dimensional chess master to have a master plan.  Instead I think Zovaal is actually an opportunist throwing darts at a wall to see if anything works.
[6:59:54] zoovthepally: wonder if they are going to mirror anduin and arthas's story even more.  Is Anduin going to continue being heroic of some sort of tragic figure.   That's one thing I'm super interested in going forward.
[7:00:00] UnProfessionalsLLC: 2300 rating for arena is a little high imo
[7:00:36] UnProfessionalsLLC: For some classes it is absolutley the WEAKEST power increase lol

[7:11:45] Ronangic: if you don't play that often, do you really think you should get your second legendary as fast as the people who play daily? i mean, c'mon
[7:11:47] UnProfessionalsLLC: Most the rep is also weekly, not daily quests I know that.  but blizz is still basin their game off upper 5% of players. sometimes 1%.  They ignore normal players
[7:11:55] zykonicc: use ur whole hour each day to do dailies yikes
[7:11:59] lithium364: its probably the new chinese year tiger mount

[7:15:17] chrslp: @feherlofia123 Did you ever raid in vanilla?
[7:15:22] manmower: rep should have a weekly cap that builds up, like conquest points, so you dont have to play every single day
[7:15:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah if you had to complete the raid to get the double leggos, that would screw people worse than rep gating
[7:15:24] hyperjaws: Rep should be fun to grind
[7:15:33] Schrock: hard to please dedicated and casuals players at the same time
[7:15:33] jeffnsteff2019: rep rewards should be tailored towards player power but more cosmetics and QOL

[7:15:37] bonkyouded: let us get rep from raid bosses would be nice
[7:15:41] swordart_19: Social Media do not represent people in game playing.Most of them are negative jaded/haters just hating and should quit long time ago.

[7:16:45] oldaccount_oldaccount: Can you use that voice for the rest of the stream?
[7:16:46] CCG_337: but why more than one way for unlock legos? rep or raids?
[7:16:54] jarilrpg: I'm fine with rep, just not a fan of dailies, would prefer weeklies. sometimes it's hard to log in once a day, but weeklies are more manageable. @towelliee
[7:16:56] UnProfessionalsLLC: Blizz is in the business of making money. Its their JOB to insure content last long enough between development.

[7:17:15] haugexxx: what do you think about the tinker spoiler?
[7:17:16] UnProfessionalsLLC: Time gating stupid things is still dumb tho lol.  And not making things account unlocked adds to the crazy

[7:17:26] CCG_337: more options or ways to unlock something
[7:17:30] valianya: They need more ways to gain certain reps like Netherwing item turn ins, Ogrila specific quests, Lorewalkers treasure finding, Cloud serpent raising baby, etc.
[7:17:31] shmasherd: I'm married with a full+ time job and a kid. If they gated me behind a raid I'd just quit. Not worth it in my eyes. I'll take rep all day because I can chip away at it with my available time
[7:17:34] CCG_337: it is better
[7:17:44] Crisis88: Is the double leggo account wide?

[7:18:10] Ronangic: a new patch comes out... i play the game regularly... i get the 2nd leggo... i just don't see the problem
[7:18:11] HahnAndOnly: shortest one
[7:18:12] Xirmak: whatever is the most efficient
[7:18:14] CCG_337: just put mounts and transmogs in the exalted rep, that's it
[7:18:16] HahnAndOnly: fastest
[7:18:17] futomara01: easieest
[7:18:18] Crisis88: People will use the shortest route, but that is fine.\
[7:18:18] JackHealMe: Man rep grind is honestly the easy way, I just don't see any other reason but people just wanting to cry at blizzard
[7:18:20] flebbooo: Easiest, most efficent
[7:18:21] Aristy1: whatever is most efficient
[7:18:23] Sacurra: @shmasherd agreed an hour or two a day chipping away at rep makes it possible and hour a day in a raid is impossible
[7:18:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: The most efficient one, 9 times out of 10
[7:18:24] swordart_19: Lot of you should quit if you are upset /not enjoying instead of being negative and raging over every nuisance .
[7:18:25] bumpstock75: THE MEDA
[7:18:34] penqun: The funnest
[7:18:36] Schrock: what about unlocking through some sort of tier difficulty mechanic like Torghast?
[7:18:37] mrniceguy817: Fastest easiest cheapest
[7:18:38] metavahn231: ill do one of ea
[7:18:38] swordart_19: true

[7:18:53] flebbooo: Pog
[7:18:54] Aristy1: nice dude
[7:18:56] veeta1: maybe it depends on what kind of content you like but yeah its not an easy thing to solve
[7:19:05] UnProfessionalsLLC: 2300 arena,  arguably harder then 20mythic key.  Also the 4th boss in a raid on mythic?  or is it 6th boss on mythic?  seems the hardest of alllllll the options
[7:19:05] penqun: Pog
[7:19:07] chrslp: PogChamp
[7:19:15] UnProfessionalsLLC: 20mythic key be the easiest I think
[7:19:26] Twistedgamer12: is this TOC?
[7:19:28] Trekxx: towelliee theres new information on MMO champion about encrypted shit

[7:19:41] bukka_hot: fun DansGame  what kind of game you think this is
[7:19:53] PapaBeks: rep grind has always been a part of the game. the game isnt designed that it goes at the same pace for everyone, if you are casual than accept that, some sweaty hardcores, some casuals, thats always been the game
[7:19:54] manmower: can we negotiate a bit here? maybe a +15 instead?
[7:19:58] danimoto10: oh
[7:19:59] GivTater: I would do whatever made sense for my RP character Kappa
[7:20:11] Peqdevil: personally I would rather grind than pug a M+
[7:20:15] akia03: +20 also cheapest to just buy
[7:20:17] Trekxx: @PvtHudson093 he's never gonna click the link :(

[7:21:53] Snabido: What, like recently nerfed? üëÄ
[7:21:58] FiftykBolt: Just saw the vid, loved it! :D
[7:21:58] GivTater: we would use it. it's what we already do clicking on everything we can in the group finder trying to get an invite.
[7:22:09] bumpstock75: Honestly i don't like being forced to do +20 to unlock gear or mounts
[7:22:20] xThatDevil: @Towelliee If they changed the schematics for how Mythic+ worked. Take away the "Key" mechanic and make it a progressive system and you don't lose your progress for loses but only get rewarded for good progress on M+
[7:22:22] Trekxx: towelliee theres new information on MMO champion about encrypted shit
[7:22:22] UnProfessionalsLLC: make mini achieves.  to enter 1-5, requires nothing.  5-8 would require other beat and GS.  8-10 soemthing else. and so on as it goes up.  Its not a wild west RANDOM que, can be coded for success.
[7:22:24] valianya: Maybe if its done in tiers of difficulty
[7:22:44] futomara01: i think you can dismount, i remember doing something like that
[7:22:45] Laluzmia: For me the thing I hated the most is when I have to do PVP stuff to get BIS items for raid !!! everything else I can deal with lol
[7:22:48] UnProfessionalsLLC: getting away from toxic group forms HATING on some class's cuz they want their key to be EASY mode carry.  that is what we need to get away from
[7:23:15] thunder993: someone else can kill them while you fight to help though
[7:23:18] futomara01: or with the help of someone else?
[7:23:19] valianya: You need a buddy to kill it after you start I think

[7:23:49] Schloshed: !rwf
[7:23:53] Kickitnine: i get some people wouldnt want to solo que but having the option there i think is great for those who want to solo que
[7:23:59] Rayzodoom: dump lfr and normal mode is the queue is a great idea
[7:24:01] iblighters: I agree with that
[7:24:01] thunder993: normal mode isn't easy enough imo for random que
[7:24:11] chrslp: True
[7:24:13] futomara01: but looking at how ppl act in lfr, it will be a shit show
[7:24:16] Aristy1: lfr needs to be gone
[7:24:24] akia03: but than they need to nerf normal allot
[7:24:26] Maxoru0: that's a good ideal
[7:24:28] flebbooo: Would make sense for them to change it
[7:24:32] SirVoro: I kind of agree too many difficulties
[7:24:33] Trekxx: towelliee theres new information on MMO champion about encrypted shit
[7:24:34] MaleFrom73: what about the 5% buff per wipe?
[7:24:35] Ronangic: i would not want to queue normal with randoms
[7:24:37] Schloshed: Hard agree. No more LFR. Just make normal the queable one
[7:24:39] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Trekxx (warning)
[7:24:41] UnProfessionalsLLC: DAm this brings back memories lol.  I did this sooo many years ago no

[7:24:50] lithium364: huntsman in lfr and normal had almost the same damage numbers if the hounds would not get ccd
[7:25:03] chrslp: Keep Looking for Raid tool and remove LFR Raid mode
[7:25:11] chrslp: LFR mode rather LUL
[7:25:21] hyperjaws: When do you think the next WoW expansion will be announced?
[7:25:37] valianya: LFR is harder than Normal because random pugs you Can't kick for being bad
[7:25:39] lithium364: i wonder if people would even notize if they would replace the LFR tool with normaly difficutly
[7:25:40] Korupcija_: there should be normal and mythic, and M+ dungeons just fill the gap
[7:25:40] veeta1: it would be great if the LFR content was a different or encounter than the harder content
[7:25:40] swordart_19: "Raiding"
[7:25:42] Velashen: FF14 has 24 man ones as well.
[7:25:47] manmower: too many classes/specs to only have 8 people
[7:25:47] zykonicc: i want cross faction so bad
[7:25:55] iblighters: wow wouldn't work with less than 20
[7:25:59] mavericks312: idk i dont think any other mmo touches WoW's raiding
[7:26:04] thunder993: 36 specs cant fit in 8 man raiding design
[7:26:09] UnProfessionalsLLC: Valian, I have been in some of the worse LFR, aslong as 30% of the dps know the fight, 1 outta 2 tanks. and half the healers know the fight... the boss dies man
[7:26:15] chrslp: Cross Faction PVP on TBC classic was interesting
[7:26:23] Reddevc: did they actually commit to cross-faction?

[7:28:20] Aristy1: should even be pvp
[7:28:26] Poriand: they should do cross faction for BGs
[7:28:29] UnProfessionalsLLC: world PVP is a no no, but Bg already a cross faction
[7:28:32] akia03: but how is bliz going to do there horde vs alli xpacs than?
[7:28:33] Tomolitic: pvp too should be ally pvp for arenas is dead
[7:28:34] manmower: cross-faction for Mythic raiding only
[7:28:36] Reddevc: I mean, imagine the streamlining they can do regarding story progression like BFA if they only had to do one storyline that everybody follows
[7:28:41] CCG_337: factions at this point im wow is a luxory, the faction thing is very unbalanced at this point

[7:29:12] zoovthepally: they could say "yeah we'll work together but if you encroach on our lands....we'll fight" so guards still attack

[7:32:40] Ronangic: they can still do HOF if they flag players with it so that it doesn't count for like 90 days after they first got it, so they can't group hop and cheese it... if anyone in group is flagged, no HOF achievement

[7:33:25] Vindmolle: Proffs were good back in Vanilla/Classic i think
[7:33:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Professions should be a kind of catch-up these days, not the best gear but something reasonably useful

[7:33:39] johnnboitoi: Honestly I'm a fan of how TBC does it. You farm for a pattern and then that piece might be your bis for that raid
[7:33:43] Xirmak: how to 'fix' professions: make the best stuff in game come from crafting.... solved... for bots

[7:46:26] Salfurium: @Sielu11628 Yes, add challenging and fun events (like invasions) with meaningful rewards to older zones, make all the old dungeons and raids somehow relevant again. There is so much content just dead in the game.

[7:46:52] manmower: if Horde and Alliance quest in the same zones, should be higher quality content

[7:47:07] Xirmak: thats why WoW is in the shitter though.... the further away from Azeroth we get the more it goes downhill. The original idea and concept was that the main character in the game.... was the world.
[7:47:10] Sandisy: targeted updates to the old zones is fine but wasting time updating them all for people to level through in a few hours seems pointless

[7:47:13] Sielu11628: @Sielu11628 Oh, I 100% agree with making old content relevant again. I'm talking about people who want the new expansion to be a revamp (i.e. old zones at higher levels for the 10.0 stuff).
[7:47:15] CCG_337: that's right is mora about how you use the assets

[7:47:30] darkh79: they should make the old content relevant the way that FF does really - scale it and make it available all the time in "roulettes" that award a currency to get things
[7:47:34] Jesdawow: when is the tiger with the chinese new year coming FeelsOkayMan
[7:47:39] darkh79: stop limited timewalking

[7:47:48] manmower: I don't feel like we've full developed Feralas or Dire Maul yet
[7:47:52] Sayryn: Bring back Barrens chat.
[7:47:57] Orthobullet: like the maw?!
[7:47:59] Salfurium: @Sielu11628 No way, that would indeed be terrible
[7:48:00] tomcruise210: we shouldnt go back to azeroth until wow hits its 20th anniv
[7:48:01] Shongoshi: speedruners ?
[7:48:01] sniffsc: Mulgore is the puinnacle of zone design
[7:48:01] ralecgos: yeah but like we now have a shit ton of old content in the game just rotting there and it's sad
[7:48:05] rivera9: u  mean keys... SNORE
[7:48:10] lithium364: transform all of azeroth into grizzly hills Kappa
[7:48:18] Klako1: yall if your neighbor asks you to try a dab proceed with caution!
[7:48:21] board4life65: i hope the jailer ends up blowing up azeroth KEKW
[7:48:23] Sneekzx: People hate change. They want WoW to feel like 2004 again. Reality check: it won't but it can still feel fun with new ideas.
[7:48:28] tomcruise210: god i love wrath
[7:48:35] MackPlays: That‚Äôs literally the whole concept of classic
[7:48:37] manmower: as long as they don't pull a MoP and pull an area out of their ass
[7:48:39] Xirmak: Broken Isles, Zuldazaar, Kul Tiras, etc..... New content, still on Azeroth
[7:48:42] futomara01: undermine and scarab underground zone from wotlk!!

[7:48:53] Valestrus: @Towelliee allowing high level players quest in older areas will allow low level (new players) see older zones actually populated. most of the zones are deserted - not good. We need way to gauge player interaction, irrespecitve of level
[7:48:53] Xirmak: its still azeroth
[7:48:58] Sielu11628: @Xirmak This
[7:49:04] Relic7: MoP was a great expansion
[7:49:04] Xirmak: again..... still azeroth
[7:49:05] Alegnowar: Exppanding azeroth is good
[7:49:09] fletch8: drakemountemerald hmmmm
[7:49:12] fredrik_1992: MoP was so good. Prove me wrong.

[7:49:38] ralecgos: i think the point is the game is getting so old now that all that old content it just left behind to rot and it's going to just keep happening as the game goes on
[7:49:38] Sielu11628: Yeah, we all agree that Azeroth is fine (just NEW zones ON Azeroth)
[7:49:41] Alegnowar: so drago expansion it is?
[7:49:48] Kindosar: eastern kalimdor - new zone hype
[7:49:50] piratechris: Give us a new place to do the expansion but also adding new features and expanding the old zones is also good. Do both
[7:49:51] GivTater: don't we still have another half of azeroth? what is between kalimdor and eastern kingdoms ?
[7:49:53] Chum964: I just want the next xpac to be one landmass. I hated BFAs 2 island and hate shadowlands different realms even more

[7:49:58] futomara01: @Alegnowar 70%
[7:50:06] BlindFaithFuel: what if for some reason you did it as the opposite faction this time, justified by the story of course...with revamps/reworking the content.
[7:50:09] Porcos_Voadores: how about an old god take the eastern kimgdons and the entire xp we fight to retake each of the dominated zones ?
[7:50:13] pacificmc1: KEKW
[7:50:18] piratechris: I'd love for it to be Dragon Isles
[7:50:21] rivera9: zero
[7:50:23] Thoreya: copiumm
[7:50:25] piratechris: Also Emerald Dream would be cool
[7:50:26] manmower: Emeral Dream 100%
[7:50:27] Relic7: @Tartarhuggo Snore fest
[7:50:29] Noshpan: @Towelliee Just watched the mount video, was pretty hilarious
[7:50:29] tomcruise210: Sadge
[7:50:35] SnoWeazel: why not both
[7:50:36] Shongoshi: could be Elune based expantion
[7:50:37] Ingmar1918: People like to play games over and over with the same content, the game of chess has simple content but people have been playing the game for over 500 years doing the same things over and over and over again
[7:50:37] fletch8: cude be
[7:50:39] ralecgos: They brought Ysera back for a reason lol... ahem dragon isles
[7:50:40] mavericks312: id say atm its a 50/50
[7:50:44] zodd_amhai: wasnt emerald dream suppose to be a 40man raid in classic i watched in documentary somewhere
[7:50:46] TheUnknowing: emerald dream is kind of done with
[7:50:52] Porcos_Voadores: @Relic7 LUL
[7:50:57] Short_Film: What happened to the rumors that old zones were going to be reshaped when go back to Azeroth ?
[7:50:59] Joneeeez: what about Elunes world, emerald drake?
[7:51:02] manmower: Emerald isn't a color of the aspects, that's just an Emerald Dream thing
[7:51:05] jeffnsteff2019: emerald dream could be a patch though
[7:51:09] telethen: will there be the last expansion? and what would it be?
[7:51:19] GivTater: I love that you are still talking about my idea.
[7:51:25] dien2474: WeSmart
[7:51:31] Bayne77: our safe space Kappa
[7:51:37] truvidienn: It'll be Chromie with time travel
[7:51:38] Rudric_Ice: emerald dream was supposed to be a zone in BC or raid but they cut it
[7:51:39] Snabido: Or azeroth yoinks his and be like "my turn"
[7:51:39] zykonicc: waynes world
[7:51:40] pacificmc1: can we live on zovaal's nipples if he becomes the new world soul
[7:51:40] futomara01: lifelands

[7:51:48] SnoWeazel: Elunaria?
[7:51:51] CCG_337: i was that movie already, so that is plausible lol
[7:51:52] manmower: Emerald Dream means we can finish Ursoc's story
[7:52:03] pacificmc1: emerald dream would be ResidentSleeper
[7:52:07] zoovthepally: not really feeling a druidish emerald dream what can malfurion screw up this time kinda thing

[7:52:50] vosicks: turns out this whole time the jailer is dadgar
[7:52:52] pacificmc1: we need an expansion with Hogger as the end boss
[7:52:52] valianya: Nah, whenever I talk about 'updating' old zones content  I'm talking about current story quests sending us into old zones for completely new content set in that zone.
[7:52:55] GivTater: I'm gonna write my own fake leak.
[7:52:59] mavericks312: keep the cosmic stuff coming
[7:52:59] CobblyWobbly: I think these "leaks" keep forgetting that in the developer update that they said this is the last chapter in first book of Warcraft.  I think the next expansion is going to turn everything on its head with new characters and storylines
