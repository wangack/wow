[1:53:23] YZIOHP: I can't wait to experience tbc
[1:53:32] Lorkass: does every1 in the raid use drums or is that super sweaty min max?
[1:53:33] Epicsapphire1988: what server is the guild going to be on anyone know ?
[1:53:37] Kinghorn: it is drums yeah
[1:53:51] Jarlan23: i cant take bear tanks seriously. i always want to pet them
[1:53:52] Sluggs_: @Lorkass you can have 100% drum uptime if you rotate between all 5 people
[1:54:01] Kinghorn: we dont even know if tbc is coming out, let alone how they are doing it Epicsapphire1988
[1:54:10] Kinghorn: wait until friday :P
[1:54:12] Chibrewz: @Towelliee M'uru was nerfed twice, first by 15% in 2.4.3 and again by an additional 30% in 3.0
[1:54:23] Epicsapphire1988: @Kinghorn ah ok I wanted to start a charecter and be ready
[1:54:31] NickLeonhearth: ehhh 5 shamans... havent seen that in a raid in 10 years
[1:54:54] Sluggs_: ret brings enough utility
[1:54:54] Jarlan23: i remember the wrath prepatch. my warrior went from bottom dps up to the top with the rebalance
[1:54:55] Supwizy: the ret we are watching is tickling him
[1:55:11] Beer_Goblin: the clackers on these lads, in awe of the size of em
[1:55:30] Sluggs_: adds are phase 1
[1:55:33] headshotb1lly: is the feral druid power shifting with that level 40 helm I wonder?
[1:55:40] Ohnoes11: not to mention the filmer wouldve had to have a killer setup to record and play
[1:55:42] MuttonChopins: this is ret pally?
[1:55:50] thebakeriscomingforu: if memory serves Ret had a mana regen for the group, and moonkin brought a ranged dps boost.
[1:55:53] lithium364: cant wait to see 5x eleshamans again in arena LUL
[1:55:57] Supwizy: He look way bigger on my small screen
[1:55:59] Beer_Goblin: yeah this is Ret POV i think
[1:56:00] thebakeriscomingforu: So you'd bring 1 of those
[1:56:07] Sluggs_: if you killed muru you were gonna kill KJ
[1:56:07] flyingmachin3: resist!
[1:56:17] cabalish: so basically 100 - 200 people
[1:56:18] Jarlan23: ya my guild was still progging in BT when sunwell came out. we never got in there
[1:56:25] Darkb4ne_: spriest gave mana regen
[1:56:29] icemanj99: Didn't drums not give exhausted/sated back then too? That's why all the drums used?
[1:56:30] schizowillie: Will Classic and TBC be separate?
[1:56:39] headshotb1lly: did we get achievment system on sunwell patch or was that WOLTK pre patch??

[1:56:47] Sluggs_: @icemanj99 that didnt exist back then
[1:56:56] icemanj99: that's what I thought
[1:57:06] Sluggs_: could even lust in arena
[1:57:15] Zvent90: Cant wait for every guild to require you to have leatherworking for drums rotation. least it's not as tedious as world buffs
[1:57:17] MuttonChopins: are ferals any good in TBC or ret pallys?
[1:57:17] Darkb4ne_: Do you think some items should have a maximum price on AH? Seeing as people know whats going to be in demand
[1:57:20] Supwizy: It would be fun if the classic team was allowed to mess with the fights to mix things up
[1:57:22] thebakeriscomingforu: @icemanj99 if i recall correctly the drums didn't debuff
[1:57:30] Beer_Goblin: dude my casual guild coudlnt push Loot Reaver...we had some potato raiders, the guild was all about community, not prog
[1:57:43] Sluggs_: drums are cheap to make and have 50 charges those are easy to use
[1:58:06] JakobEll: Did they announce classic TBC or will this be private server?
[1:58:57] Supwizy: funny how this old tbc model looks better then the warcraft reforged one
[1:59:07] megaleo420: thats insane
[1:59:12] Thoreya: id love to start at level 1 for BC but i really doubt theyll do that
[1:59:16] Thoreya: bc people wud be angry af
[1:59:23] schizowillie: I want the Helm of Malferlic for the wings on my lock
[1:59:25] Beer_Goblin: "and it went to a rogue"
[1:59:27] Beer_Goblin: lol
[1:59:29] megaleo420: my guild never saw an eye in classic
[1:59:30] Lorkass: yeah economy is pretty bad in classic atm 350g on some big servers just for a flask :/
[1:59:34] WebsterLou: you wont be able to start at 50 or 60 for tbc you ll have to level
[1:59:47] Sluggs_: @WebsterLou we dont know that
[1:59:52] lenzoo21: this an actual TBC footage?

[2:00:49] xSivart: Have you gotten a lot of response to the recruitment thus far?
[2:00:55] Zvent90: Having both fresh servers and carry over servers would be 10/10 some people love starting fresh others don't
[2:00:55] Jaggens: i miss old sunny lingering chain heal beams
[2:01:04] Kinghorn: the only reason I want to see fresh servers is so people who have horded 50k+ gold get fucked

[2:02:13] thebakeriscomingforu: probably 1 enhancement shaman to boost the melee group with windfury
[2:02:18] schizowillie: Accidentally leaked on purpose to get views on blizzconline
[2:02:30] metavahn231: ret also giving that raid buff
[2:02:52] Beer_Goblin: idk man, classic being the niche spot for all the "sweatys"...in my experience there is a clear divide between "we want to have a throwback experience" and "PARSELORD"....i expect required professions/drum rotations or shaman stacking for chain lusting etc

[2:06:20] silentknight190: classic,tbc and wotlk was when wow was at its best
[2:06:43] Molvonos: Classic leveling was garbo. Classic as a whole was garbo, sure it was fine and dandy when it was relevent, but that was 15+ years ago.

[2:07:09] Zarinna2015: 2.4.3 patch will be a huge mistake, a bunch of the attunements were removed by then and the bosses were heavily nerfed except Sunwell.
[2:07:14] silentknight190: towilee will u quit retail for tbc?
[2:07:17] TheUnknowing: yep, towelliee always been on that tbc wagon
[2:07:30] Ohnoes11: BC was where i got my start in raiding. still loved it
[2:07:33] metavahn231: i tried bc for the first time on private server and it was a solid experience, classes felt fun to play and dungeons were decently challenging
[2:07:41] SlackerSlack017: at least ur server has ppl :)
[2:08:34] TheRiwen: to one
[2:08:44] TheUnknowing: I'll be interested in seeing if they plan to do templates or copies from classic for tbc, if they do copies I guess ill have to level a horde character on classic before tbc comes out lol

[3:58:57] mavericks312: blizz isnt putting a great amount of work into classic anything
[3:59:10] Roffasauras: imagine doing Vashj with 40 people
[3:59:10] Khalio23: He kinda offended me by saying no one wants to raid 10 man. i think 10 man raiding is great imo
[3:59:15] Jay_rb: It started well now it's a pepeMeltdown
[3:59:16] Sollice: #classicnochangesunlesdtheyarechangesthatmakemylifeeasier

[4:01:44] Xgen1X: Oh np
[4:01:58] MuttonChopins: I kinda hope they do a 1-70 level imo
[4:02:15] Khalio23: @kkuullzz Better not be the case
[4:02:18] FatTown: Have they announced anything about TBC or is everything just speculation?
[4:02:23] efpsychi: Honestly that guy just sounded like a person that is bored of the game he has played over the years and wants to experience something new
[4:02:24] PokerFaceMoose: @TacoVendor93 i agree
[4:02:38] MuttonChopins: Speculation, but it will most likely be announced @FatTown
[4:02:40] Khalio23: Speculation its not even confirmed but everyone is hyping it so much

[4:04:17] sinlesssinner: @chat havent been watching the stream lately, sup with the camera being off, is he ok?

[4:07:41] dracullus: they haven't, but it's pretty obvious
[4:07:51] dtp4444: @Oriqqs Everyone believes they are announcing it at blizzcon this week
[4:07:55] MuttonChopins: yeah I mean they did do a survey about TBC servers almost a year ago
[4:08:07] showmethesugar35: imagine if they dont
[4:08:09] Redbearded16: I’d say 80% chance they mention it to some capacity
[4:08:11] crazywhiteman71: @towelliee i like your new look

[4:09:08] Armdel: with 1000+ kills and no drop, you gotta think that perhaps the drop rate is too low
[4:09:10] ventu105: @Towelliee what server you play on Classic?
[4:09:12] Todmeister9000: do they have mission tables?
[4:09:13] dracullus: I will play DIV, but I want go blind there, since it's rather impossible in WoW
[4:09:25] ventu105: I play Faerlina
[4:09:29] efpsychi: the demand is there, blizzard won't want another nostalrius fiasco
[4:09:36] kkuullzz: speaking of aldor and scryer... do you guys remember jimmy "machinima"?

[4:10:45] kkuullzz: Btw guys... do you think first week Archimonde kill will be a thing in classic TBC?
[4:10:47] MuttonChopins: I think in the survey they said if they do fresh level 58/60 characters, it will happen with belf and dranei as well @ch0ller
[4:10:48] Hitokiri83: Blizz may do something like if you have a 60 on classic you unlock premade 58 for TBC or something of the sort
[4:10:51] MaX_DutchyW: enchance shamans were top tier right

[4:11:51] MaX_DutchyW: not alot of people had thunderfury tho in official classic

[4:11:54] dracullus: no matter what Blizzard will or won't do, someone will complain, it's not argument
[4:11:57] FatTown: Also with the change to PVP Gear, you were able to grind out the high warlord/grand marshal stuff if you had badly geared alts.
[4:12:05] Keyastaron_: what was gold cap in TBC
[4:12:10] infektyd: itll be rough for people who want to be horde paladins and alliance shamans, unless they allow faction change and xfer, if they go the xfer route
[4:12:12] duffluv22: You think it should stop at Wrath?
[4:12:17] Kyrrua: that's it, gold cap but per account and its fine
[4:12:35] OnceAMoose: Time to farm Primals
[4:12:36] SilkeySmooth: classic tbc just needs a gold cap of around 500 gold
[4:12:46] kkuullzz: @Towelliee i was looking into tbc database... most of naxx gear is on the same stats level of t4 content...

[4:42:01] Armdel: he turned into a frog and went to ardenweald
[4:42:10] 無職提督: maybe he lost his memory?
[4:42:21] Taz_85: Maybe Sylvanas doesn't even know he's dead. Jailor holding onto his soul as a hostage or something
[4:42:22] Masqerader: That was anima, they were farming him for his shoulders too
[4:42:24] Roffasauras: I swear if we don't get the spider-man finger pointing meme with Guldan, I'll be disappointed

[4:44:45] Roffasauras: hail hydra
[4:44:55] Meshindale: HAIL STYGIA
[4:44:57] arturiuss44: Sylvana's long con was that all of the main characters had to die to be able to help her in the shadowlands to give choice rather than everything being predetermined. And after they win all of them are reincarnated as their best selves.
[4:45:04] Klauzzer: lizard people?

[4:45:38] Aidler: @towelliee what's Khadgar up to these days?
[4:45:59] NewWorldReign: You think thats why Sylvanas is somewhat close to the Jailer cause she worked with the dreadlords after leaving Scourge?
[4:46:03] Armdel: i figured she wanted to just stop people from dying completly
[4:46:08] Pallananana: Do we alrdy know who fucked up the arbiter?
[4:46:09] odysseus1: Everyone basically goes to the shadowlands to become batteries, that doesn't sound so good lol

[4:47:22] Roffasauras: the helm shattering broke the veil
[4:47:28] Roffasauras: the machine of death broke sometime during Legion
[4:47:33] Meshindale: bellular did a video and speculated the titan Argus broke the arbiter when he fell
[4:47:36] WhiteKnight74648: If we gave the Arbiter GFuel that would fix everything?
[4:47:39] mrbzombie: it was obviously hogger who fucked up the arbiter
[4:47:45] HaloS23: @Towelliee am i the only one thinking that the jailer and arbiter are 2 halfs of the same whole?? Arbiter has the dark orb in the center and jailer has the whole in his chest?

[4:48:40] DrakeDuude: Sylvanas is actually a good guy. She is going to free us from the Gods will. A true William Wallace. FREEEEDOM!!!
[4:48:46] J0rki: tow u still playing classic off stream?
[4:48:47] Ryok: sorry arbiter machine broke, understandable have a nice day
[4:48:50] SorionTheGinger: "the arbiter has encountered a critical error please conntact your system administrator"
[4:48:58] storm99413: argus soul wound the arbitor is what he's saying
[4:49:13] Sluggs_: shes being set up to be the hero
[4:49:18] Kriven: arbitor is about as reliable as a mcdonalds ice cream machine
[4:49:19] naesong: i doubt it was argus that put the arbiter in their current state. i think that happened before sylvanas killed herself after wotlk

[4:50:20] Thoreya: Time fucking flies
[4:50:28] Basedd_god: Hammers up
[4:50:31] Mortiie_: i THINK the arbiter is made from the jailer. She is more mechanical looking than the other eternals and with the matching chest she and the jailer have. Also anduin may be the jailers vessel to escape the maw or something ??
[4:50:36] WhiteKnight74648: When we kill the jailer we end up fading away and we appear in a cart with a guy looking at us. The first thing he says is "So you are finally awake"
[4:50:38] mavericks312: the horde needs to build new leaders up with thrall and baine being the last 2 basiclly

[4:54:33] HaloS23: @EnragedSushi i think the runecarver is the primus
[4:54:39] EnragedSushi: I'm guessing the "bad influence" to the Jailer was the Void Lords. :shrugs
[4:54:44] EnragedSushi: @HaloS23 Could be.
[4:54:57] QuantumleaperGG: prob true form
[4:54:57] Kromede: GandalfPls
[4:55:02] Todmeister9000: the runecarer?
[4:55:09] motorboatingpro: looks like the runecarver in a fancy robe
[4:55:13] Meshindale: Gandalf the Jailer
[4:55:13] littlejoeyv: looks like a zombie zeus
[4:55:16] VictorAvalanche: runecrafter is the primus
[4:55:19] manmower: looks like an earlier design and they changed their minds
[4:55:20] naesong: kinda looks like a mashup of arbiter/jailer but with hair/beard

[4:56:16] mcgillacutty916: WAS TBC ANNOUNCED?
[4:56:23] fredAsavage: Instead of him being influenced by an outside source may be the ability and power he had to do the influencing is what corrupted him. would signify that he was even more powerful before his fall, like a first one.
[4:56:26] roflpotamus: @Towelliee so will you be releveling since going horde?
[4:56:27] Hitokiri83: he wants anduin to recover his true strength that was taken from him when he was imprisoned in the maw
[4:56:31] NewWorldReign: Yeah, he cant escape the Maw.
[4:56:34] Roffasauras: jailer was banished to the maw right? would make sense he wants to get out

[4:56:44] NewWorldReign: Even though the Maw is his area.
[4:56:50] EnragedSushi: I mean if Blizz is retconning the Primus saying "ancient minds" influenced zovaal to go bad
[4:57:21] Hitokiri83: he was but it wasnt called the maw
[4:57:23] Roffasauras: maybe there was no maw before the Jailer and they had to create a new area for people like him
[4:57:27] roflpotamus: oh sorry, I assumed youd be prot warrior again
[4:57:28] EnragedSushi: ^^
[4:57:29] ARmunkki: The Maw wasnt always like it is now

[4:57:40] whatitdo1738: what if there the same person but the hole means they split from each other

[4:58:12] NewWorldReign: Maybe thats why the Arbiter is down and out, cause the Maw become corrupted like the Jailer.
[4:58:13] Molvonos: There's speculation based off SL Beta stuff, that the Maw used to be a place called 'Oberlon', which was ruled by a king. @Towelliee

[4:58:50] Jokervenom1978: Thats would actualy be cool.
[4:58:53] Cyberangel89: @Towelliee Apparently , The Jailer was the original Arbiter and became rogue when he saw a flaw in the system and then the Covenants jailed him and made the Arbiter as a substitute

[5:06:21] BaldirCrowseyes: If what I understand is correct, it says that Azeroth is exceedingly powerful.
[5:06:25] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee Theres a quest in Bastion were you go back in time to help the covenant fight off the Void, could that be a spoiler for things to come?

[5:07:58] duffluv22: Be like Argus
[5:08:06] Masqerader: apparently she can be the most powerful world soul that is slumbering
[5:08:07] xXTHEJESTXx: the pantheon has said she would likely be more powerful
[5:08:19] EthicalHermit: Jailers seat
[5:08:27] storm99413: aren't titan all world souls
[5:08:32] infektyd: i mean.. will the planet disappear if she "comes to life"?

[5:09:17] xXTHEJESTXx: but don't worry you can use this necklace made from Azeroth herself!!
[5:09:19] InTheDM: I feel like the last 3 expansions have the same exact premise. You get a special item or series of talents you build on for the whole xpac. It’s just boring😭

[5:09:46] frozenseal930: chat is the ilvl 200 TW quest worth the slog of TW?
[5:10:05] Molvonos: @frozenseal930 Can you replace any piece of gear with ilvl200? If yes, then yes. If no, no.

[5:10:12] xXTHEJESTXx: with illidan
[5:10:16] odysseus1: let's all just talk it out, bro
[5:10:17] kokochris: @frozenseal930 if you dont have ilvl 200gear; for sure
[5:10:22] BetsyAndCo: if they brought back a similar set like in Pandaria it would be wonderful

[5:10:32] banana991: will you watch the diablo stuff on friday?
[5:10:34] Khandak: Sargeras show's up, takes the sword back and kill's the jailer, Im calling it

[5:10:57] BaldirCrowseyes: What in the goddamn is Chen doing right about now?
[5:11:05] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Maybe the empty seat was for Illidan
[5:11:14] combolizard: where is harrison jones
[5:11:15] Masqerader: think its more of a therapy session
[5:11:26] storm99413: chen be drinking all day
[5:11:30] Cyberangel89: they are gonna make us ally with Sargeras to fight the Void Lords
[5:11:33] Hitokiri83: the empty seat was sargaras it just was never filled
[5:11:36] MisterRonB: @Towelliee those 389 attempts, is that just for this year so far? or total?
[5:11:37] Taz_85: Could've been Argus' seat
[5:11:47] Taz_85: Or did the pantheon not even know about Argus originally

[5:17:39] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Daggerstry Answer me this...are you using SFE or Fang's for leggo?
[5:17:44] Sollice: Well we know the dreadlords inflitrated the burning legion, and we know specifically that Veramathrix(? The Dreadlord who they think is part of the Army of the Light ) all server Denathrius

[5:18:57] filos0phia: no
[5:19:04] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Daggerstry Why? That's actually bad for BM. Switch to Fang's. Your pets do more crit damage
[5:19:27] Sollice: And thats him
[5:19:30] 無職提督: and they have contact with the void lords, too, okay im starting to believe it now
[5:19:34] Sollice: Right he is undercover
[5:19:40] Kinghorn: NOOOO not my favorite light dreadlord
[5:19:42] filos0phia: @Taz_85 during his crusade against the demons, sargareas found a planet completely consumed by an old god. On that planet he found the Nethrezim who convinced him he needed to start the Burning Legion to save the world souls

[5:25:14] Sollice: Anduin needs to die and Sylvannas. At the end of the expansion the dreadlords are goig to be revealed and the plan will unfold. It going to create a shitstorm in the galaxy and the Light will be shook because they had a dreadlord in their midst

[5:25:59] Coolmankenny: !tbcapp
[5:26:24] Roffasauras: maybe we'll finally fight Mal'Ganis or something
[5:26:44] ZeethianDragon: seems like blizz is trying too hard to push the "learn from your mistakes shit"
[5:26:51] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I hope we dont see Arthas. I hate him so much
[5:26:51] frozenseal930: wow BR?
[5:26:59] Affiiance: Its lonely over here on Alliance
[5:27:00] NewWorldReign: Even if Anduin is decided as the new LK, how can he when the helm is fucked?
[5:27:05] Basedd_god: HahaDreidel
[5:27:06] Kromede: KEKW
[5:27:06] Klauzzer: that would be pog
[5:27:09] Dixietwist: the internet would break
[5:27:13] EthicalHermit: game would break
[5:27:15] Templexx: then comes another faction
[5:27:18] InTheDM: I feel like that should be the move
[5:27:22] wreckshoptv: pull missdirect too alliance :P
[5:27:29] roflpotamus: would be a cool shift in race to world first meta
[5:27:31] bypized: I think Blizzard would want to justify that more with lore/story content
[5:27:34] Holysal: well we know reddit would be mad
[5:27:36] Sollice: @NewWorldReign They already made a new mournblade, you think they cant make another helm?
[5:27:40] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: crossfaction when
[5:27:42] Carryout: imagine 2 raid teams, one horde one alliance, going into the next tier side by side
[5:27:43] ZabberzTV: raid chat be like frigging alliance players
[5:27:49] Sayryn: I know some people who are hard core Alliance that woudl hate that. LOL
[5:27:57] DrakeDuude: id actually be able to play alliance again
[5:27:57] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Daggerstry Ok, but ur gimping damage for yourself especially when you said you're only doing 3.5k DPS in Heroic CN. Put Fang's on and you'll be doing more damage. But I dunno what to tell ya if you're doing 3.5K DPS while im over 1k in DPS above you with Fang's.
[5:28:13] bypized: @Towelliee do you see blizzard ever updating the WoW engine in an attempt of a WoW 2?
[5:28:23] Affiiance: Fuck that Im harcore Alliance... give me some fucking Horde to do High Keys with
[5:28:24] Krewger_: I think we're gonna free the blacksmith and he will create a weapon for Anduin to use against the Jailer.
[5:28:28] Klauzzer: what about world pvp tho
[5:28:33] Todmeister9000: I can't raid next to humans DansGame SMOrc
[5:28:38] ARmunkki: I dont really see a point anymore in the whole alliance vs horde anymore

[5:28:57] warrenny: Hardcore alliance? That still a thing?
[5:29:00] NewWorldReign: @Sollice new mournblade?
[5:29:01] Daggerstry: @I_DoctorSatan_I You mentioned your M+ damage, not your Denathrius damage..... apples to oranges. Additionally, Dire Beast is second best for raiding scenarios after SFE. Literally all references say so
[5:29:07] wisperuna: @Towelliee i am still amazed why we do not have something like the mercenary option for mythic +
[5:29:07] LolitaAldea: wow looks amazing and timeless
[5:29:08] Khandak: They just need to improve server/game performance stuff, nothing else
[5:29:09] bypized: @Towelliee Thats true, but since when Blizzard does not gives us something we don't ask for LUL
[5:29:11] roflpotamus: Only MMO that looks better is FFXIV pretty much

[5:33:36] bypized: @Towelliee it's almost like they understand that to protect Azeroth they need to combine forces....
[5:33:40] toobaked1987: Horde vs Alliance has become very boring. I hope they are done with it.
[5:33:47] Sollice: @Baleroc1 Thats literally called the USA
[5:33:55] Zactasia: some offset of the horde/alliance starts some shit and tries to bring their whole faction into it but then the bigger picture happens
[5:33:56] PokerFaceMoose: let the poor/non nobility kill each other, while we stay in power
[5:34:07] jerseyfive: bfa tried to revive that war but failed

[5:47:18] Poriand: getting conduits sucks. its annoying for my alt
[5:47:21] I_DoctorSatan_I: 35 Anima > 70 Anima...SO rewarding Kappa. 5 min WQ can grant 104 Anima, but a 20-30 min dungeon can net you 70 Anima. Blizzard logic
[5:47:58] pavepawns: a guildie just got the love rocket :8 now im sad

[5:50:17] TheBeastofCaerBannog: I can tank on my DH for ya

[5:50:34] soldi_26: i transferred from a low pop server to a high pop (bleeding hollow) what a HUGE difference
[5:50:35] TheBeastofCaerBannog: @Towelliee i can tank for ya
[5:50:36] Venkxx: just give us anima powers in the maw like in torghast, everyone would love to be there :D
[5:50:36] MisterRonB: damn @Towelliee I wish I didn't have to go to work... I've got like 10 monks as tanks for the holiday boss.... even though they suck. lol
[5:50:37] TheCliffyShow: When they said the Maw was a terrible, horrific place they fucking meant it.

[5:53:28] ZeethianDragon: that would hurt...
[5:53:30] TipsyTails: Inb4 they write it in as Torghasts basement
[5:53:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: imagine a raid with random anima powers
[5:53:43] TheRavenGrave: My Thing is this so the system that blizzard had was a good system before the valor system it just was not implemented well. Example : when the monk was first introduced the monk had a really good combo system that many players said they could not learn so instead of looking at that system and either working through to make it better so ppl could learn the new monk system. Blizzard instead moved the monk to the Mana and action system that they knew how to use and work with .

[5:54:38] JLmorten: and u can only farm it in the maw.
[5:54:39] RocketMan23: my thought for fixing torghast was that you enter without any abilities what so ever, and all the anima powers are abilities from every class in the game allowing you to build a custom class
[5:54:41] Agito_Akihito: That's when i say goodbye to WoW again until next expac releases
[5:54:42] toobaked1987: Can TD be an anima power please blizzard
[5:54:43] Malarick: you mean gear we get in the last patch right? not anything we already have?
[5:54:46] TheBeastofCaerBannog: hence the buffs and adjustments we've been seeing to anima powers
[5:54:49] Alienfromger: blizz taking notes LUL

[5:54:51] Taz_85: Incoming that one anima power that's gonna be like Twilight Devastation
[5:54:58] TheCliffyShow: Random anima powers for the last raid? And you think people whine about unfairness in the world first race now. Limit wins and all the EU players scream, "they got better anime powers."
[5:54:59] MisterRonB: I love the multi chains of ice/chains of anguish combo on my DK
[5:55:04] mavericks312: mages get the smarter mirror images
[5:55:09] ijuki: @Venkxx You would use it on a mw to apply that buff on every one POGGERS

The only thing still on the power grid is Blizzards servers. The only way to play Wow is LAN parties at the Blizzard Server Sites. Every day is like a mixture of Burning Man and Fyre Festival around the server zones.
[7:05:31] khakifry: @Towelliee the immersion was broken when they didnt make your in-game character a paladin
