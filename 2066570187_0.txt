[0:08:40] coledplay: seems comp dependent
[0:08:44] Mhortai: I am on your side. People pointing to the top 10 on the ladder and what happens in AWC is narrowing down things A LOT to fit a narrative imo. I will leave it at that @venruki

[0:12:53] lasergazer3: Oh I thought only Rogues got faster gcd from haste?
[0:13:17] ramenxo: every class and spec gets that
[0:13:21] EliteDamit: what’s up ven windwalker going well?

[0:13:47] cornflakes_au_getchop: so what healing spell do you use really ? regen when insta proc and rolling mist on players or not even that ?
[0:14:00] EliteDamit: you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain
[0:15:33] varok87: @EliteDamit That's some deep thought right there.
[0:17:09] EliteDamit: LUL
[0:17:18] fisherman948: yt!
[0:19:48] serp7: Touch
[0:19:53] pewnee: no touch?
[0:20:06] galifax2: question for chat, have y’all gotten the Valentine’s Day manuscript if you tried,I’ve heard this manuscript was much harder to get
[0:20:06] pewnee: sadge
[0:20:09] serp7: Ahh it was lit up but I know it also is shit
[0:20:17] What_ln_Tarnation: uhh

[0:23:53] soothingmistmonk: Like blood dk war
[0:25:13] fearsii: im pushing myself to get 1800 to all healers, i got hpal, rdruid, pres, working on shammy
[0:25:19] fearsii: shammy free tbh
[0:25:31] lasergazer3: Other than dh and resto druid, what are some of the best specs to push from 1600 and onward?
[0:25:54] valorbrandx: Ive been watching you for a few years, and genuinely did not know you played with Reckful. Saw a short documentary about it
[0:25:57] fearsii: hpal was easiest i think cuz high mmr from last season
[0:26:01] Axtin: I think the toxic thing about them is they never have to cast and if you try killing them they just port/restoral while stunned every other stun or get sanc/intervened, the only cc that feels really effective vs them is cyclone
[0:26:27] CondorWow: I like your shirt Ven, good band
[0:27:05] Axtin: ya true im speaking 3s mostly
[0:27:25] Xeliumimar: 3000??? lol ive been getting away with tipping 25 gold
[0:27:34] zlovett08: oh shit
[0:27:34] ramenxo: super annoying into me as a hunter once they learn to just smack my pet
[0:27:36] zlovett08: i tip like 20k
[0:27:40] ramenxo: before they learn to smack pet free win
[0:27:44] varok87: i tip 500g
[0:27:52] Tippolippo: I ttip 100g
[0:28:04] valorbrandx: Do you think blizzard will address or dumb down macros with some of the videos that are highlighting the automation built into them?
[0:28:05] Xeliumimar: @varok87 HeyGuys
[0:28:07] Drockzoids: Bots run that business
[0:28:09] dawnovun: Good morning friendrukis
[0:28:15] What_ln_Tarnation: the crafters can proc expensive mats for themselves when they make you stuff so you dont need to tip high
[0:28:20] varok87: @Xeliumimar rukiGrin
[0:28:56] ItsBees: ItsBees subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 118 months, currently on a 118 month streak! That's a lot of months Pog rukiLove
[0:29:03] vanlonja: @venruki melee Pala healer died for fistweaver to live KEKW
[0:29:21] ozzyxy: I thought you said mrbeast
[0:29:38] flandrs: so glad melee pal healer is gone lmao
[0:29:41] Axtin: fw way more tox than hpal ever was
[0:29:43] ItsBees: I am Mr Beast
[0:29:46] theodeth: Beads?
[0:29:51] claudiogodx: SUP MISTER RUKI
[0:29:54] Slayer_Eagleone: LULW
[0:29:59] huevoslol123: Atreyu was dope when Alex was still in the band

[0:30:10] claudiogodx: YESS
[0:30:12] claudiogodx: is me on alt
[0:30:19] Xeliumimar: it would be so sick if we can customize the colors of our spells to be more unique from each other
[0:30:26] claudiogodx: bad looby for me 100%
[0:30:29] claudiogodx: but nice games
[0:31:07] SaintHearth: fistweaver is when you wanna be a melee dps but want healer ques haha
[0:31:11] dawnovun: That Warrior has more of a venruki name than Venruki's monk has
[0:31:17] dangen86: healing? :D

[0:31:42] dismantlle: I'd like to order some garbanzo bean
[0:33:29] DrewPBallz18: I just finsihed watching your new youtube video and i think that we should just go back to arenas with no weakauras or macros
[0:33:45] DrewPBallz18: reason rouges are so broken is their burst is put into 2 macros since half the buffs are not globals
[0:34:08] varok87: @Xeliumimar I would like an AK-47 instead of my Pistol on my Outlaw Rogue.
[0:34:12] DrewPBallz18: addons like bigdebuffs dr trackers and weakauras should not be in rated pvp
[0:34:24] symptomV: 21min que 0-5
[0:34:56] varok87: @symptomV Been in que for 56min already on my Outlaw ResidentSleeper
[0:34:58] Gamarth_: playing ele into a fistweaver is awful, i feel for this guy lol
[0:35:15] Monkfupanta: can you show your stats as fw?
[0:35:38] Monkfupanta: thanks
[0:35:40] Tragictomb: lol gross running the hpal out of mana
[0:38:07] Slayer_Eagleone: THE knockbacks are just way annoying
[0:38:08] lifeproof: Im pretty sure u can have only one Zen Spheres :D at same time
[0:38:26] Slayer_Eagleone: a double kill?
[0:38:27] renghost22: the ole double kill
[0:38:30] Fixit_cat: What chu gonna do with all that monk, all that monk inside your trunk
[0:38:34] taywright23: is there legendary gear like shadowlands in dragonflight?
[0:38:41] SaintHearth: ven woke up and said we are gonna be the villian today haha
[0:38:44] railander: it's literally copied from zenyatta
[0:38:45] likeewlock: wow close to ele dmg
[0:38:46] Slayer_Eagleone: LUL
[0:38:48] ear_shot: are you gonna play cata classic
[0:38:49] zachgamegodx: @venruki run the ox kick for max tilt
[0:38:50] renghost22: @taywright23 legendary? yes.. like shadowlands? no
[0:38:55] zachgamegodx: kick ppl all over the map
[0:39:02] tikdoks: you can have zen on 1 friendly and 1 enemy at the same time
[0:39:46] prometheusx47: insane balls
[0:40:32] taywright23: @renghost22 ohh ok I can’t find anything about legendary gear in this expansion
[0:40:44] jerryhunna: not a good patch to  be ranged spec i feel like
[0:40:59] e10100111001: say "I think its you" to the ele, he'll lose his mind
[0:41:20] renghost22: @taywright23 there are 2 legendarys in DF so far... a fist weapon for evokers off 2nd raid tier last boss and then a 2h weap off fyrakk this tier, but that's all
[0:41:21] Tragictomb: this poor Ele is playing fine this lobby is just hot garbage lol
[0:41:24] Slayer_Eagleone: and players wonder why there are no healers
[0:41:28] Caedalade: Everyone is toxic at every rating
[0:41:34] prometheusx47: are you having fun fw? i feel like i should learn how to heal and fw would be the easiest transition to start
[0:41:35] bowlmoose: i have 4 healers i play solo on.  its miserable lol
[0:41:40] likeewlock: how the ele can not dmg when he just poops instant
[0:41:49] pharmztko: ya everyone is low rated cuz they blame other people
[0:41:57] dawnovun: @venruki I have said this for like a year now. But in Solo, it should work like Hearthstone. You can't even talk, you can only emote. People would cuss you out in HS too if they could.
[0:42:05] renghost22: he's saving his wall for next round
[0:42:25] tikdoks: it’s so hard to remember why I canceled my sub. Oh yeah, I’m a  low CR healer. Haha. That toxicity just gets old after a few seasons
[0:42:26] dawnovun: Pings and emotes are all that should work.
[0:42:38] CondorWow: what are your thoughts on current meta and how it may effect the AWC finals? mostly talking about how a lot of teams  are prepping their dh comps - will we just see a lot of DH mirror games?
[0:42:53] Slayer_Eagleone: how generous of you venruki
[0:43:01] Slayer_Eagleone: to share thy balls
[0:43:03] ozzyxy: 27k dps
[0:43:07] ozzyxy: OKAYYYYYY
[0:43:10] soothingmistmonk: Hes saving wall for next lobby
[0:43:29] VetisBR: he saving wall and his dam for next
[0:43:30] Protties: Hey, Ven. How hard would it be for the pvp community to just create the meta they want - like the HC arena experience rukiCool no silly addons, maybe  even unspec some modifier bs.
[0:43:31] likeewlock: warri carry that
[0:43:35] vilecurse_01: Double dh resto sham
[0:43:49] DrewPBallz18: Great song
[0:43:51] pharmztko: rukiCry
[0:43:54] varok87: Twitter is a place to have interesting conversations for sure LUL
[0:43:55] Ronn_Deezy: i wish i could stop being bad
[0:43:59] theodeth: Maybe he meant bad as in good
[0:44:10] famous1939: he's not even running tremor :D
[0:44:16] pharmztko: ya he meant bad asssss
[0:44:19] railander: pala trolling this round
[0:44:22] Slayer_Eagleone: LULW
[0:44:26] ozzyxy: LULW
[0:44:27] famous1939: what a toxic ele LUL
[0:44:27] Slayer_Eagleone: i love shuffle
[0:44:28] Mhortai: I mean, you need to press your buttons....
[0:44:35] dawnovun: Link him your stream
[0:44:37] soothingmistmonk: Must be an ele thing
[0:44:37] ozzyxy: thats my smurf sham
[0:44:38] dawnovun: lol
[0:44:39] vilecurse_01: He's 12 give em a break
[0:44:40] Fixit_cat: hahaha
[0:44:45] Ribastur0075: whaaz püacticing arms dh
[0:45:07] Subaracs: Yo Ven, I watched your video on Arcane Mage for 10.1.5. I'm trying to learn it but spec feels daunting. Any recommendations for other source material to learn from?
[0:45:15] Razdruid: have you ever wanted to get back into tourny/awc play? or just enjoy casting too much?
[0:45:17] DrewPBallz18: does this song give anymore guitar herro three flashbacks
[0:45:20] annihilationdecimate: yoo
[0:45:34] Subaracs: I saw his video but it was like 2.5 hours long
[0:45:37] famous1939: i just watched his arcane video yesterday, was very helpful
[0:45:42] Tippolippo: yeah he put out a 2hour guide
[0:45:45] Tippolippo: very well done
[0:45:51] Slayer_Eagleone: :O
[0:45:58] lifeproof: i meet feral druid  who was 2400 in 3v3 and   1100 15-18 lose in solo  :D its crazy how low impact u have on ur  rating in solo
[0:45:59] Tragictomb: well I think that’s the 3rd healer I’ve seen Ven make quit in the lowbie bracket
[0:46:01] Subaracs: Thx!
[0:46:08] Shcottaye: Ever since i watched Aeghis' videos, i went from 1900 down to 1700 KEKW
[0:46:13] Tragictomb: not sure this is good for the healer population lol
[0:46:27] Gamarth_: that sounds like a short term goal
[0:46:31] dawnovun: Once you beat him rename to FoxBeater
[0:46:33] famous1939: beating a shirtless foxxy and saying it aloud is a good way to manifest it
[0:46:34] DrewPBallz18: I just finished watching your new YouTube video and I think that we should just go back to arenas with no weak auras or macros. The reason rouges are so broken is their burst is put into 2 macros since half the buffs are not globals. Addons like big-debuffs dr trackers and weak auras should not be in rated pvp. And if they didnt want to go down the route they could just make it no macro/addons a rated playlist.
[0:46:40] pharmztko: foxyllHAIR foxyllHAIR foxyllHAIR foxyllHAIR foxyllHAIR foxyllHAIR
[0:46:41] soothingmistmonk: If you fight foxy llama and he is shirtless you have to beat him shirtless
[0:46:48] VetisBR: does statue even do anything if you dont soothing mist chan as fisty boi?
[0:46:50] Ifwuzzy: should be pretty easy
[0:47:00] dawnovun: @venruki Once you beat him rename to "FoxxyBeater"
[0:47:06] ozzyxy: @venruki ozzxyzMetaphor this should be your primary target
[0:47:18] pvalue01: i wanna watch ur new video but i feel like its gonna make me depressed LUL
[0:47:19] Laziltv: ur using statue in M+?
[0:47:24] VetisBR: ahh ok
[0:47:35] famous1939: good pro tip there
[0:47:44] Protties: ven. how much dono to start the no-addon rank 1 push meta
[0:47:48] LokaJay: Hi Ven!
[0:47:55] LokaJay: Hello Chat!
[0:48:03] VetisBR: interesting. the build i saw from meekmonk doesnt take statue talent
[0:48:08] Bigvuqoffdam: watcha up to rukiGrin rukiGrin rukiGrin
[0:48:28] Fixit_cat: Ven's Supervillain Arc

[0:48:41] derangedhippo: We like FW here
[0:48:43] derangedhippo: lol
[0:48:50] dawnovun: @venruki sing this as "The RukiFul People" for us
[0:49:03] driftwood_tc: Not me. I've tried forcing myself to like FW for the past 2 days... I just cant.
[0:49:08] driftwood_tc: good to watch though :)
[0:49:20] varok87: 1H15 minutes in Solo Shuffle queue wth. ResidentSleeper

[0:50:36] Slayer_Eagleone: yes you are LUL
[0:50:36] shivwren: He's not trying, but he's succeeding
[0:50:39] greentko: i like this new toxic outlook in life
[0:50:40] Razdruid: ^
[0:50:45] Fixit_cat: If not toxic, why toxic shaped
[0:50:47] Mhortai: @venruki you are doing it for the good of the game.
[0:50:47] Razdruid: we like toxic ven
[0:50:51] Mhortai: :D

[0:51:07] Badasti: dont hate the player hate the game LUL
[0:51:08] JarJar_Brinkz: But at what cost
[0:51:11] driftwood_tc: you ever tried foot pedals for extra keybinds Ven?
[0:51:14] Razdruid: a little bit of evil for a greater good
[0:51:18] JarJar_Brinkz: Sadge
[0:51:22] Razdruid: man of the people
[0:51:34] kyaii: sometimes the cost is too damn high
[0:51:42] tikdoks: great question… would you rather have 5 min queues but they are 90% FW or 60 min queues and never see them
[0:52:05] freshdots321: Good morning Venruki
[0:53:27] KralHor: Did he just dark nothing?

[1:26:59] ferahgok: @toxicvenom406 lol troll.
[1:27:07] pragma90: @toxicvenom406 ya you are in the wrong place if you want sympathy
[1:28:28] toxicvenom406: no sympathy just pissed off. I hate solo shuffle so much and yet I’m in q 🫤
[1:28:42] nikthevoker: always need a leash for the lobby dog or they go running off and could hurt themself!
[1:28:43] zachgamegodx: it’s crazy at these ratings the dhs are garunteed to either be clueless in game sense or not know the dps rotation
[1:28:58] zachgamegodx: if you have a little of both you’re elite already
[1:29:13] pragma90: @toxicvenom406 i think thats called a mental disorder, repeatedly doing something you despise

[1:31:03] FateIRL: waht did barndoor say
[1:31:22] aragarde: crazy take buff aug for shits and giggles :D
[1:31:40] venruki: https://twitter.com/barndoor11/status/1758998258674978935
[1:31:48] emergencxyz: So DH skill floor is much lower than other DPS in order to do well, But DH skill ceiling to play at a top level is about even with other melee such as ret DK war ETC @venruki
[1:31:49] Cudsfab4: @venruki how did you move the dragon flying stamina?
[1:31:53] emergencxyz: Still warrants a tune down tho
[1:32:05] Badasti: haha, which character of yours that you play did he have in mind
[1:32:06] Moobot: Latest video "Retail PvP Is Plagued With Problems Right Now… And Players Are Not Happy" view it here: youtu.be/sTd8uoLysI4

[1:32:46] Badasti: i hate it when people argue like that "oh dont blabla he's blabla everyone"
[1:32:50] Xeliumimar: when do you press slow fall as a mage
[1:32:51] FlyFYI: dhs dont even have a full page of skills lol
[1:33:07] ozzyxy: narc cannibal
[1:33:09] ozzyxy: def a banger
[1:33:10] FateIRL: whaaz got 2500 in shuffle on his 2nd day playing dh. its clearly broken
[1:33:11] Cudsfab4: alright anyone in chat know how he did?
[1:33:20] eainzsp: get some air jumping off of mugambala
[1:33:40] ferahgok: @FlyFYI So true lmao. I swap from some of my other toons to a DH and can't even fill up 2 actions bars on DH XD
[1:33:42] toxicvenom406: I’m hard stuck at 2500 with dh
[1:33:46] Tinmania: you have to check the encounter box
[1:33:48] Cudsfab4: oh shit its default
[1:33:52] Tinmania: to move it
[1:33:52] williwhite94: good morning/ afternoon good sir may i ask a question to you and chat ? @venruki
[1:34:12] Salanzo: that was the question - can't ask another
[1:34:15] Salanzo: jk :D
[1:34:21] emergencxyz: You missed the part where I said DH damage still needs a tune down
[1:34:30] williwhite94: i just started to pvp and my hands get sweaty and not when im doing pve its been over a few days and forsure only happens during pvp
[1:34:33] FateIRL: barndoor is grinding rank 1 it makes sense he doesnt want the spec nerfed, but they are overtuned
[1:34:37] emergencxyz: it was in a second message
[1:34:48] renghost22: Just went 9-0 in 2s with a pug and climbed to 2100 mmr with this guy, and he got mad and bailed on me after we lost 10th game duckSad
[1:35:03] brawlcuttt: @williwhite94 Whats the question sir ?
[1:35:14] Badasti: i dont agree, dh is much easier
[1:35:20] kyaii: What is going on with chat and dh copium?
[1:35:33] zachgamegodx: I like dh the way it is, whenever I face a demo sp  on my dh, I’m like, yes, this spec needs to exist to keep these jackasses in check
[1:35:36] williwhite94: @brawlcuttt im wondering if its my nervousness that are leading to my ahdns getting clamy
[1:35:45] williwhite94: hands* during pvp
[1:35:50] lasergazer3: reduces hunt cd
[1:35:54] FateIRL: zero DH in top 10 does that mean dh is balanced?
[1:35:54] Borngood: morning
[1:35:54] Slayer_Eagleone: VENRUKI your not in queue
[1:36:00] Boskey2016: @venruki oh no i used to main ret until you wanted me nerfed now youre gonna nerf me on DH    lol :P
[1:36:02] Badasti: blue is a minor wall and a dodge, netherwalk is an ice block and you can move, imprison is an undispellable instant cc blablabla
[1:36:05] zachgamegodx: idk if you feel the same ven, but something needs to exist for comps like that to be checked
[1:36:06] Badasti: blur*
[1:36:09] brawlcuttt: @williwhite94 You get nervous in the way of people might flame you in PVP or ?
[1:36:12] Slayer_Eagleone: LULW
[1:36:18] FateIRL: thats what barndoor said
[1:36:22] Borngood: dh are so busted LUL
[1:36:27] Borngood: I had 3 in my shuffle
[1:36:28] aragarde: All i know is every season has a hero of sorts, we had this issue with augmentation and rets and locks
[1:36:36] ButtaTWD: even tho cdew qd with outlaw DH to get there
[1:36:38] chachio_dk: doesnt the top 10 change every night
[1:36:51] Tinmania: I really enjoy dh, very stress free to q shuffles
[1:36:53] Cudsfab4: recommendations on where to put the df stam bar? kinda like the top center
[1:36:56] FlyFYI: its not the same game
[1:36:57] ferahgok: Lol what a horrible, cherry-picking argument
[1:36:58] williwhite94: @brawlcuttt no im winning in pvp ! but my hands are only getting sweaty in pvp lol idk if its due to me not being used to it or idk lol
[1:37:00] aragarde: like if it isn't dh today its going to be rogue the next season or nerf to any class, something will be more broken or outplaying some other class and back to this rollercoaster of this needs nerfs
[1:37:00] b58dan: good afternoon ven, hope ur having a good day <3

[1:37:08] yippey_: Mornin Ven
[1:37:16] gelatokush: @venruki can i link a weak aura
[1:37:19] Badasti: i wonder if barndoor plays any alts
[1:37:24] zachgamegodx: idk if you feel the same ven, but something needs to exist for comps like that to be checked @venruki
[1:37:39] stealthwalker99: If I have time, that graph is about to be all enh sham at 2700+
[1:37:40] brawlcuttt: @williwhite94 Could be :D must be focused which is not bad, prob just get used to everything and it will stop, not 100% sure
[1:37:58] Badasti: im genuinely curious, i dont think you can play alts and be that absorbed in your own position on dh's
[1:38:15] chachio_dk: They need to look at the interaction between chaotic imprint and chaos bolt
[1:38:16] zachgamegodx: “I like dh the way it is, whenever I face a demo sp  on my dh, I’m like, yes, this spec needs to exist to keep these jackasses in check” re this
[1:38:17] KikLTheSoHot: perfectly balanced (c) blizzard
[1:38:18] Badasti: yep
[1:38:26] 777delayed: @ozzyxy my guess was cvark
[1:38:27] williwhite94: @brawlcuttt yeahh thats what i was thinking just wanted to know if thats where the term : sweaty ass playrs" are from
[1:38:30] TimmyShoes: i've heard that the majority of EU elemental shamans are botting
[1:38:35] Badasti: coz ive played classes thinking they are easy only to find out theres more to it, and that they have their own issues
[1:38:43] chachio_dk: I remember when they nerfed necro aura to target dk/aug/pres. should do the same for chaotic imprint
[1:38:53] aragarde: wizards are boring
[1:38:56] Badasti: but dh is just as easy as I always thought it was, too much value from single buttons
[1:38:58] leeka: bfa s4 wizards was fun!
[1:38:58] brawlcuttt: @williwhite94 think thats when there is gamers who dosent shower, pee in bottles, greasy etc
[1:39:07] fulvoustv: it like when its a caster melee meta @venruki
[1:39:08] Borngood: I dont mind wizards when ppl actively play, not sit back
[1:39:08] belvedee: harry potter cleave vs harry potter cleave is a little damp and boring
[1:39:12] aaggros: They just need to make MM great again  to keep these wizards in check
[1:39:14] Ribastur0075: so true. bfa season 4 /3 was worst
[1:39:18] khrylx_: destro lock is on par with dh prolly
[1:39:19] brawlcuttt: not sure
[1:39:30] Rzzzi: i hate the skill floor diff between melee and caster
[1:39:32] Borngood: it was wizards and rogue mage
[1:39:35] TimmyShoes: @belvedee what about jedis vs. harry potters?
[1:39:36] eainzsp: is that because most wizards dont have ms?
[1:39:40] Bluguieghe: but don't the melle have too much gap closers now? they are like glue..i feel like
[1:39:43] eainzsp: so the game is longer
[1:39:45] ozzyxy: dh dk
[1:39:46] ozzyxy: dk dh
[1:39:49] Badasti: werent there plenty of people running around with huge gushing wounds etc on melee's>?
[1:39:52] ozzyxy: ^^
[1:39:53] Reuhn: it was all dh dk gushing wounds
[1:40:04] Reuhn: and haste locks
[1:40:04] nikthevoker: double outlaw

[1:40:33] zachgamegodx: if they buff feral or hunter, jungle would keep DH in check.
[1:40:34] pragma90: were you thinking about fistweaving
[1:40:37] Badasti: probably guilt from playing fistweaver

[1:52:20] emergencxyz: if you are playing bloodmoon

[1:55:58] MrFuzzynuts420: how do you normally play fistweaver?
[1:56:02] killer9298: from what i've played of punchmonk its fun and fairly simple
[1:57:03] Tragictomb: punch monk into any pet class is tons of healing
[1:57:17] Tragictomb: blackout kick cleaves the pets
[1:57:35] cuxlol: is faeline basically what allows u to heal ur team with ur attacks? or

[2:01:37] eygton: who needs a nerf more outlaw or demon hunter ?
[2:01:57] Metaphors: thats fine ozzy
[2:01:58] Tragictomb: punch monk just needs to go back to being way of the crane activated buff

[2:02:09] zachgamegodx: verdant tether
[2:02:24] e10100111001: yeah crit is low
[2:02:27] driftwood_tc: @eygton I'd rather want them to focus on making classes fun to play again such as feral and healers.
[2:02:35] ozzyxy: @Metaphors hey bro that picture is legendary
[2:02:35] wowitsrasta: Double verdant tether embellishments
[2:02:36] zachgamegodx: it gives friends vers and u
[2:02:37] killer9298: do you play one faction more than the other or nah?
[2:02:39] What_ln_Tarnation: does critting dam crit the heal too
[2:02:45] Ribastur0075: both
[2:02:49] gelatokush: i play the Bank build and hes around 19-20% crit no mastery
[2:02:53] gelatokush: i liek it
[2:03:04] eygton: @driftwood_tc you know I think that’s a great idea just buff other classes instead of nerfing
[2:03:09] eygton: feral really needs it lol
[2:03:20] ButtaTWD: they should bring other classes up to outlaw and dhs the stam is too high it would be more damp than it already is
[2:03:21] itsjodyhiroller: anyone know the totem weak aura he uses?
[2:03:27] varok87: @eygton Just check how many DH and Outlaw Above 2400 Rating in Solo Shuffle, you will get ur anwser.
[2:04:23] gelatokush: bank used his neck as crit haste
[2:05:00] nikthevoker: verdant conduit
[2:05:09] zachgamegodx: what do ya think it’s called
[2:05:19] gelatokush: tetehr is cool cuz it actually makes a visual tether linking u from your party memebers and i feel like it helps teamates stay close in ss
[2:05:23] drdoomkinx: Get comduit
[2:05:24] Gotheels: ive seen some fws run shadowflame damage embell too
[2:05:34] drdoomkinx: Zerdent conduit
[2:05:34] Cudsfab4: that does seem good considering your in the fight with melee teamates
[2:05:42] stealthwalker99: Meep told me that he’s playing 50 percent vers on his fw. I would assume dropping vers is bad
[2:05:46] zachgamegodx: @gotheels prolly pve or something,
[2:06:21] gelatokush: your stats are perfectly fine if u wana do more dmg u want crit
[2:06:24] Shisnolol: your mastery seems a bit high still
[2:06:26] drdoomkinx: Tether vers falls off with range
[2:06:33] Zeltexs: i always play 30% vers
[2:06:39] nikthevoker: you dont want tier
[2:06:43] nikthevoker: i thught
[2:06:47] gelatokush: high vers is good cuz makes it less likely you die
[2:06:54] nikthevoker: was that last season
[2:07:16] WhereMaldo: is haste good for mw? I thought mystic always said rock full mastery for shuff healing
[2:07:20] WhereMaldo: idk tho not an expert
[2:07:35] gelatokush: yes you want 31% haste plus
[2:07:46] WhereMaldo: ah lil one punch man
[2:07:51] WhereMaldo: Tod showing up to work
[2:08:06] Tragictomb: isn’t tier kinda useless for fistweaver
[2:08:06] gelatokush: its super good
[2:08:11] gelatokush: rop is tranq
[2:08:13] Tragictomb: cuz you don’t cast renewing most
[2:08:37] Tragictomb: if you don’t heal into chi harmony you don’t proc 4 set
[2:08:38] gelatokush: ww/fw slams
[2:09:13] Tragictomb: if you’re casting mist I guess it’s good… casted mw only uses 2pc
[2:09:52] gelatokush: u proc some renweing mist on teamates too
[2:09:55] gelatokush: when hitting
[2:10:07] soddi: hit the druids forest xD
[2:10:09] Tragictomb: ah didn’t know that
[2:10:15] Slayer_Eagleone: KEKW
[2:10:15] mymuhcels: kekw monk is the most zippy dps
[2:10:25] Bigvuqoffdam: lmao so toxic
[2:10:27] Bigvuqoffdam: "um no"
[2:11:11] gelatokush: poor druid lol
[2:11:19] gelatokush: he doesnt know wat to do
[2:12:09] Metaphors: fistweaver gear is haste verse
[2:12:10] Metaphors: :D
[2:12:14] Espi_27: druid could play anti knock talent for a start lol
[2:12:22] Cudsfab4: fw is tough into classes with aoe cc
[2:12:33] wowitsrasta: I think it's toxic asking someone to change their spec lol
[2:12:43] eceria: lol the druid didnt take the anti knowckback talent
[2:12:48] Metaphors: if u guys keep chopping down these trees soon we will have no oxygen
[2:12:49] eygton: with you being a healer this is looking like a 6-0 lobby
[2:12:49] gelatokush: one less healer in ss boys BibleThump
[2:13:03] eygton: @gelatokush 😂😂😂
[2:13:10] Tragictomb: idk if you sit a 45 min queue and end up in a lobby with 2 prot paladins I think you get to be as toxic as you want lol
[2:13:59] TimmyShoes: @Tragictomb don't prot pallies count as healers also?
[2:14:01] TimmyShoes: in ss
[2:14:07] gelatokush: this was about to be his frist cloen in 4 rounds man
[2:14:11] gelatokush: he got kick
[2:14:17] gelatokush: sadge
[2:14:29] Yoruus: @TimmyShoes They only play against other prot pallies.
[2:14:31] itsjodyhiroller: anyone know the totem weak aura he uses?
[2:14:43] slimthicknasty9999: !totem

[2:15:00] FateIRL: teea totem weakaura
[2:15:06] itsjodyhiroller: thank you fate
[2:15:22] Yoruus: @TimmyShoes Yes, but they only play against prot pallies, they have no chance against other healers atm.
[2:15:37] ozzyxy: @Metaphors please upload that emote ozzxyzJoshua ozzxyzAl
[2:15:40] saintone__: Hey @venruki what spells should I put nochanneling for arcane mage?
[2:15:44] Hor1zonX: wp

[2:16:00] TimmyShoes: @Yoruus those lobbies must be quick xD
[2:16:31] Yoruus: @TimmyShoes They, are, they extremely random, that's why dps usually hates prot pallies :D
[2:17:04] khrylx_: @Yoruus everyone hates tanks in arenas
[2:18:09] Yoruus: Well, I'v seen some extremely good blood dk's recently, and last season Brew was pretty decent.
[2:18:30] volbyz: no one cares if theyre good, no one wants to play against them
[2:18:36] Yoruus: I mean Brew was in AWC right?
[2:18:56] eygton: they weren’t even targeting thay druid
[2:19:04] eygton: target that mfer ez win
[2:19:26] Yoruus: @volbyz I bet if the ques for dps woudn't be so LONG, nobody would mind strange specs.
[2:20:01] volbyz: that would do nothing
[2:20:09] TimmyShoes: @Yoruus it hasn't happened to me yet but i'm curious to see when it happens. i play ret pally though so it'd probably feel really bad
[2:20:22] lasergazer3: getting sick?
[2:20:31] isseswagger: can we watch your youtube vid
[2:20:37] TimmyShoes: nobdy wants to play with prot pally healers

[2:21:07] Telarius1: Prot pallies legit all win-trade with eachother on alt accs at 2k rating end of each season, Since pro pala's only face eachother

[2:21:42] Tragictomb: I think the next evolution is setting up an ele bot honestly
[2:21:46] Telarius1: Its 1 of easiest bracket, cuz they only que into other prot pallies. Legit will log on their alt acc, que up, and afk on it
[2:21:50] Telarius1: To feed main lmao
[2:22:08] Telarius1: Ive found them alot
[2:22:09] Telarius1: On alts

[3:13:24] driftwood_tc: No destro is weak, needs a buff in pvp and pve... same goes for DH also weak.
[3:13:37] barndoorr: ^
[3:13:38] nikthevoker: everyone made a DH alt
[3:13:55] SteLawBro: In a race people will pick the fastest car. Why drive a prius when you can drive a ferrari?
[3:14:05] xhinoc: for real this suck's
[3:14:06] Bigvuqoffdam: double dh when 👀
[3:14:16] driftwood_tc: "some people picked a DH alt" FeelsWeirdMan
[3:14:17] DichToph: Is a Desto lock easy to pick up spec?
[3:14:24] xhinoc: ppl dosent have personality anymore
[3:14:36] nikthevoker: if its not broke, dont fix it
[3:15:35] Cvarks: baboosh
[3:15:57] xhinoc: MoP mog with mage tower weapo

[3:20:08] barndoorr: its coming later today bud dont worry
[3:20:12] illEvan11_11: should next alt i lvl be DH or destro Lock? im pretty equal at playing caster and melee
[3:20:17] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy aulty93 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[3:20:18] emergencxyz: Barndoorr I have known you for a while and we are both on dh currently
[3:20:19] Vigi9413: little does he know ven plays everything
[3:20:21] FateIRL: DH is S+ omega shenron
[3:20:22] emergencxyz: we both know its wild
[3:20:35] ramenxo: DF s3 tierlist, selfplay dh POV
[3:20:45] barndoorr: @emergencxyz idk what ur talking about barndo1WAR barndo1WAR
[3:20:47] Redpeanut01: FW in 2s is aids
[3:20:51] emergencxyz: Whats your punch monks 3s cr @venruki
[3:20:59] guccikikuchi: best punch monk 2s combo?
[3:21:30] Vigi9413: dh is actually really fun
[3:21:30] lexiuss: @barndoorr will you stream today?
[3:21:40] barndoorr: yea later, gotta make that tier list
[3:21:46] driftwood_tc: Fun DansGame how dare you
[3:21:47] michele1090: but dh gets boring very fast ^^
[3:21:49] jayyArrington: key word right now lol
[3:21:54] FateIRL: dh is broken op , havent heard anyone say its balanced
[3:21:54] Outer_Limitz: cant that just be because its objectively strong? if other things were stronger theyd be fun too
[3:22:01] emergencxyz: @barndoorr You know who this is right?
[3:22:03] Ambersulfr: yo
[3:22:04] ramenxo: my sv hunter would be fun to play if I had 2 charges of harpoon, 45 second CD turtle that I could attack in, permanent CA buff, 2 charges of disengage where im immune to cc and spearhead that crits for 300k and does a 500k aoe dot
[3:22:06] khrylx_: @FateIRL and that after 3 or so nerfs
[3:22:13] Ambersulfr: u2!
[3:22:22] barndoorr: @emergencxyz actaully no i dont recognize the twitch name im sorry
[3:22:34] FateIRL: why play a melee hunter when you can play demon hunter
[3:22:37] FateIRL: makes no sense
[3:22:44] emergencxyz: @barndoorr Mythicc
[3:22:48] barndoorr: <3
[3:23:02] emergencxyz: I have known you since the olden days
[3:23:09] aultymalganis: yo
[3:23:11] ramenxo: why play most melee specs in game when u can just play dh and get piloted to ratings u dont deserve with an out of this world toolkit.
[3:23:15] driftwood_tc: assa feels ass... say it
[3:23:27] Vigi9413: even if they nerf it it’ll be fun to play unless they give it the DK treatment
[3:23:32] ramenxo: dh already playing with veng dh hero spec lol
[3:23:43] isseswagger: sick if they get to perma cleave
[3:23:47] ramenxo: dh hero specs scare me they gonna give havoc more mobility and like demon spikes or some shit lol
[3:24:00] Reyington: lol I was in that lobby
[3:24:01] Smexxin: if the other rogue specs didnt exist, i feel like assass would still be at least low A tier for me
[3:24:14] aragarde: more tanky with aldrachi hero talent
[3:24:23] aragarde: nah thats clickbait
[3:24:26] DemoDreamlol: wait the hero talents are ganna be in arena?
[3:24:27] Outer_Limitz: People want the hero talents to be class skins
[3:24:30] wreklol: i actually have no clue what theyre talking about
[3:24:32] aultymalganis: the hero talents look tanky? idk
[3:24:33] ItsBees: The boomkin ones are dumb Sadge
[3:24:34] ramenxo: war within lookin sus for pvp. any dps spec with access to a tank hero spec will be bis
[3:24:35] Swishinn: hero talents seem cool
[3:24:35] illEvan11_11: i think assa offensively is underrated, really fun and strong to play. the problem is its waay easier to die on then basically every other melee
[3:24:36] barndoorr: didnt kalvish play sub in awc? like all rog specs are viable right now i think
[3:24:45] Vigi9413: I haven’t even seen hero talents
[3:24:56] ramenxo: imagine being a hunter or mage when warriors just get prot shit and dh gets veng shit and feral/boomy get guardian shit
[3:24:59] aragarde: haven't even brought them all out yet either so we don't really know much
[3:25:03] Cvarks: night played w assa
[3:25:04] Cvarks: EZ
[3:25:11] ItsBees: I need the alpha to come out and test stuff :3
[3:25:11] barndoorr: some are better than others of course, but all specs currently playable
[3:25:31] cuxlol: leveling a fw is so easy haha
[3:25:38] FateIRL: dh gaps every other spec in the game
[3:25:41] FateIRL: by a lot
[3:25:48] Cvarks: u find mage fun at all rn ven?
[3:25:49] zerx_gg: whats goooooooood babeyyyyyyyyy
[3:25:56] Vigi9413: why nerf DH we should be buffing DK lol
[3:25:56] seaent: somehow ss queues have gotten worse
[3:26:15] Smexxin: i unironically think shuffle is just more enjoyable than 3s nowadays
[3:26:17] khrylx_: @FateIRL theres a few equally broken specs ... outlaw, destro
[3:26:28] chancywilson: @Smexxin you dont heal
[3:26:33] Badasti: at lower ratings 3's can be fun but i dont like this meta
[3:26:37] Smexxin: i do sometimes @chancywilson
[3:26:38] ramenxo: assa is one of three specs i dont think i have seen all season. assa, aug and fire mage.
[3:26:39] Bigvuqoffdam: i dislike shuffle for that very reason, as a healer
[3:26:47] cw150015: !song
[3:26:47] Nightbot: Enable the AHA Music Identifier to find out the song! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-music-identifie/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en
[3:26:48] Badasti: most of your games feel like dampeners and melee cleaves
[3:26:50] ATHLTE: same
[3:26:54] chancywilson: @Smexxin is DPS more enjoyable for you? my bad.
[3:26:58] Cvarks: ya ive started shuffling again
[3:27:05] aragarde: oh thought you were gonna play mage
[3:27:05] ATHLTE: shuffle is just more stressful for that rzn
[3:27:07] Cvarks: way more chill than this 7 min mana shit
[3:27:07] Blaze150000: shuff is atm pure cancer. every ss lock/dh
[3:27:19] Smexxin: i hate losing on mana, and i hate having 8 minutes games as a healer
[3:27:25] Smexxin: dps is more fun for me yeah @chancywilson
[3:27:34] Vigi9413: the worst part of shuffle is overlapping or just trusting someone to push their buttons and they don’t
[3:27:34] barndoorr: shuffle is good for people who cant get many 3s qs, gives ppl a chance to network if they play well and at least be able to play the game
[3:27:37] ATHLTE: revert stam changes fosho
[3:27:40] FateIRL: remove drinking, make dampening start the same in 3s as it does in shuffle
[3:27:44] marvin1995xo: i hate that hpal dies faster than dps classes
[3:27:46] aragarde: LOL
[3:27:50] zerx_gg: demon hunter dead to fall damage KEKW
[3:27:53] zerx_gg: noob!!!
[3:27:57] aragarde: ^ lol
[3:28:00] IrishEthics: i started afflic/resto shaman in 2s, we specialize in taking it to damp and winning on rot.....were like the BJJ of 2s
[3:28:14] IrishEthics: drag you down and suffocate you
[3:28:15] DemoDreamlol: @IrishEthics wait till you go against BM hunt
[3:28:25] DemoDreamlol: show you how its really done ='D
[3:28:40] IrishEthics: yeah we lose to certain comps
[3:28:42] aragarde: i would like to see monk have incorporated different fighting styles into their abilities
[3:28:44] Cvarks: hes in mexico
[3:28:47] IrishEthics: BM fucks me up good and punch monk comps
[3:28:55] IrishEthics: but most everything else is pretty chill
[3:28:59] aragarde: like karate, BJJ etc
[3:29:06] Cvarks: oh nice
[3:29:17] eygton: a cutie
[3:29:46] eygton: bro I didn’t know you could get different wings??? wtf how???
[3:30:15] slimthicknasty9999: are you playing normal 3s today?
[3:30:15] Vigi9413: what do you think mage needs to make it more fun to you ven. not necessarily better but more fun
[3:30:17] xmostpalone: playing wrath arena has shown me the value of dampening
[3:30:28] aragarde: more visual effects
[3:30:28] ekologiisk: @eygton Glyph from AH
[3:30:30] xmostpalone: hpalwarr vs hpalwarr zzzz
[3:30:33] Bigvuqoffdam: i dont dislike dampening, i dislike how it ramps so aggressively in solo shuffle. It really benefits classes that have game-ending dmg cooldowns like 2nd meta, 2nd incarn, 2nd wings etc
[3:30:37] Shway1013: wrath arena, you mean battle of the bots
[3:30:40] Bigvuqoffdam: damage is king in solo shuffle
[3:30:43] illEvan11_11: deep freeze
[3:30:58] Cvarks: id trade half my mobility to be able to play aggressive again and not be afk for the entire game
[3:31:27] DemoDreamlol: feel like just a stam buff for mages could go a long way
[3:31:37] Shway1013: having 6 blinks is also tilting as a melee
[3:31:39] CommandoChiz: but it gets purged mostly right?
[3:31:50] Bigvuqoffdam: make it undispellable and nerf its strength
[3:31:59] GaryTTV: make it undispellable but a much shorter duration
[3:32:02] GaryTTV: higher skill
[3:32:03] Bamtko: id trade 45 second leap and 1 charge for all the other classes to not have 20 teleports and freedoms
[3:32:05] DemoDreamlol: make its duration 4 sec
[3:32:07] Cvarks: 10 sec way too long
[3:32:13] stealthwalker99: My only thing with shuffle is they need to adjust ms
[3:32:17] tikdoks: I think they should exchange dampening for rampening. it would be much more fun for damage to increase over time
[3:32:22] DemoDreamlol: @Bamtko if youre having trouble staying on things as a warrior its somthing youre doing
[3:32:43] Bamtko: @DemoDreamlol when in that sentence did i say i have any issues with uptime
[3:32:48] Badasti: warlock 3 rift rampening
[3:32:50] Badasti: lel
[3:32:52] Bamtko: id just rather the mobility be simplified again, jfc
[3:32:53] eygton: I got the wings they are so sick
[3:33:01] DemoDreamlol: @Bamtko ooh i got ya
[3:33:04] pragma90: what would be cool is if they took away pvp talents and made pvp trees that only worked in pvp content
[3:33:06] Smexxin: im with you @Bamtko
[3:33:09] DemoDreamlol: yeah mobility creep is tough
[3:33:20] DemoDreamlol: @Bamtko my bad miss read lol
[3:33:22] Bamtko: @DemoDreamlol yo man smexx agrees with me, tell him hes doin something wrong
[3:33:24] tikdoks: doesn’t that just mean you change the scaling to keep it from getting to doubled?
[3:33:24] Bamtko: :P
[3:33:31] Bamtko: 45 second leap and 1 charge
[3:33:33] DemoDreamlol: bruh i read it wrong chill lol
[3:33:40] Bamtko: im just roasting u bro im sry
[3:33:41] ragnof_: man sometimes tettles sounds like you in mdi casting i thought you were co casting yesterday lol
[3:33:41] Kawjiryu: 1 charge 1 intercept
[3:33:42] ear_shot: wtf is ur character
[3:33:44] Vigi9413: 1 charge
[3:33:47] thebarnabyangel: IDK BUT IT SHOULDNT BE MORE THAN FERAL DRUIDS
[3:33:47] Bigvuqoffdam: one bladestorm
[3:33:48] Bamtko: i miss when managing avatar and bladestorm matterd
[3:33:57] tikdoks: or what about increasing the duration of CC as the match gets longer?
[3:33:58] leeka: i just hate multiple bladestorms with short cds
[3:33:58] slimthicknasty9999: bring back stance dance
[3:34:04] Bamtko: like now bladestorm is just reee button and u used to have to use it properly to maintain uptime, same with avatar
[3:34:04] Smexxin: charge, bladestorm, some kinda of passive anti snare duration
[3:34:08] stonedmonkey: bladestorm with freindly fire on Kappa Kappa
[3:34:12] Cvarks: paly dh arcane w pherixreborn
[3:34:16] Vigi9413: stance dance was ass
[3:34:24] ItsBees: They just need to stop adding all the pve QOL stuff into pvp
[3:34:25] aragarde: discard plate armor for 10 second duration to reduce movement imparing effects and increase haste and damage but increase damage taken by 15%
[3:34:25] Bamtko: friendly fire bladestorm LFMAO
[3:34:33] Bamtko: thats hilarious
[3:34:43] nikthevoker: fuck it i already started setting up my DH LULL
[3:34:50] Cvarks: LOL
[3:34:53] Bigvuqoffdam: i did it while i was undergeared man
[3:34:54] tikdoks: I feel like it would be more fun to watch a chaotic finish than a slow grind to OOM
[3:34:55] LordRatigan: lmao
[3:34:58] Bigvuqoffdam: give pherixreborn a break
[3:35:00] Ronsimus: i feel like pvp ppl want more mechanical gameplay while pve just want to button spam
[3:35:03] shivwren: Please don't shuffle shame
[3:35:06] ItsBees: that's what they all say LUL
[3:35:15] pragma90: he probs got placed in 2300 lobby in greens like everyone else 0-6 to start
[3:35:19] Bigvuqoffdam: ^
[3:35:32] Vigi9413: bro shuffle mmr is ridiculous
[3:35:36] FlyFYI: @Bigvuqoffdam start streaming again bro i miss ya
[3:35:41] Bamtko: but yeah, 1 leap, 1 charge, dont need a sprint on my leap, go back to having to hold avatar/bladestorm like a smart player to keep uptime and avoid ccs. i cant stand this charge off ur mount like a dog meta lol
[3:36:07] coke_vanilla: warrior should have transcendence, blink, gateway, 2 charges, leap, insta mount in combat, and sprint
[3:36:08] Moobot: Latest video "Retail PvP Is Plagued With Problems Right Now… And Players Are Not Happy" view it here: youtu.be/sTd8uoLysI4
[3:36:08] FateIRL: every warrior leaps in the opener like an ape
[3:36:42] leeka: @pragma90 those are fun lobbies
[3:36:45] Bamtko: im sure a lot of low rated warriors do that
[3:37:16] Pavelow1806: bro advert volume has 0 chill on here
[3:37:54] aragarde: might as well have that blademaster samuro like supatease suggested built into it to allow mobility and such like the hots hero
[3:38:02] aragarde: for warrior i mean
[3:38:20] Bamtko: what does that mean @aragarde '
[3:38:44] Vigi9413: full eat no way lol
[3:39:31] aragarde: he was asking about what warriors could use, and if you've seen hots hero samuro he is a blademaster in the game and they are adding blademaster to wow, should just copy it into wow change what needs to fit the current game etc @Bamtko
[3:39:43] kasieus: rets will randomly be tanky as hell
[3:39:50] kasieus: other times they flop
[3:40:09] Bamtko: yeah idk what the samuro thing is man, never heard of this
[3:40:21] higanheim: to the death
[3:40:24] Bamtko: sorry i just dont know what it would mean to be adding
[3:41:00] Shway1013: 0
[3:41:00] kralix: 8 blinks
[3:41:01] aragarde: look up samuro from hots
[3:41:02] wabaflaba: stun blink and alter time
[3:41:06] Ebonborn: Mage should have the ability to negate a slow
[3:41:12] vesbr11: 10 blinks but each is 5min cd
[3:41:12] Bamtko: i thought 2 blinks and the thing that lets u cast while walking is good
[3:41:15] FateIRL: shimmer needs to break stuns , make ice floes baseline
[3:41:24] Vigi9413: 2 blinks
[3:41:26] thebarnabyangel: i think mages are fine arcane maybe a tad slippery
[3:41:26] Bigvuqoffdam: i think certain classes just need to be hit by slows more
[3:41:30] fulvoustv: mages just need blink with no cd that heals you every time you use it
[3:41:32] higanheim: no mage does
[3:41:34] thebarnabyangel: but i dont play warrior i play feral
[3:41:34] mellik4no: Babooshka - Бабушка = grandma) wtf)
[3:41:34] fulvoustv: make mages great again
[3:41:34] dismantlle: good opinion
[3:41:37] Cvarks: run casting is what makes mage op imo
[3:41:41] kheilas: remember when locks had run casting an entire expansion
[3:41:42] Badasti: i dont either
[3:41:44] Bamtko: i always thought mage mobility was fair until they gave mage like 3 displacements and blast wave and all these things
[3:41:51] higanheim: overwhelming majority, sorry
[3:41:53] Ebonborn: I think run casting is more prevalent in old WoW
[3:41:57] gdodmebxu: @Bamtko KEKW
[3:42:15] Bamtko: u can say kekw man but no one knows what u actually wanna say
[3:42:25] dismantlle: is frost mage better target than arcane?
[3:42:36] Keineimba: Idk, I always pref blink and flows over shimmer. Maybe due to blink nostalgia.
[3:42:39] rembrandt89: having low mobility is so boring
[3:43:04] gdodmebxu: wait why do you have clearcasting
[3:43:04] Badasti: @Bamtko you dont get 3 displacements, you get 1 displace and 3 blinks (1 with alter)
[3:43:05] gdodmebxu: as frost
[3:43:33] Badasti: i thought warriors were fine before they got 2 stacks of bladestorm, 2 charges and a leap
[3:43:52] AdamHeron12: are you enjoying DH?
[3:43:53] FateIRL: nad a bladestorm snare
[3:43:58] FateIRL: cant move your character
[3:44:03] gdodmebxu: 70% slow on bladestorm Pog
[3:44:09] Bamtko: @Badasti + blast wave. im using very loose terminology cuz idk any of the mage abilities by name, i just know they have like 5 different teleports. dnt get all passive aggressive on me lol.
[3:44:26] aragarde: mythic version
[3:44:27] gummyboiiiiii: mage tower
[3:44:27] Bamtko: taking me completely out of context when im responding to something ven asked (fair mage mobility as a non mage player)
[3:44:29] Merkflare: mythic castle
[3:44:30] pvalue01: castle nathria
[3:44:34] FateIRL: sinful recolor
[3:44:35] jondoe2239: its mythic castle nathria
[3:44:39] Badasti: @Bamtko ok then 2 bladestorms, 2 charges, 1 leap a stormbolt and a shockwave stun
[3:44:52] gdodmebxu: @Bamtko i think his point is what you think is fair would be autodeath vs any melee as mage
[3:44:56] Bamtko: @Badasti i dont even know what ur trying to say right now man lmao
[3:45:16] Badasti: im saying there's a reason mages have that mobility, because melee are like zoom zoom race cars
[3:45:31] Badasti: you cant expect mages to sit and be target dummies, we dont have passive damage reduction
[3:45:36] Bamtko: @gdodmebxu again, youre taking this out of context. youre assuming what im saying mages should have means no iother class should lose mobility
[3:45:44] Bamtko: which is absolutely not what im suggesting by a far cry
[3:45:46] gdodmebxu: yeah i think that's fair
[3:45:49] jondoe2239: also mages lose 1 charge of shimmer if they play reg blink to get out of stuns
[3:45:51] Bamtko: and that seems to be what u guys think im saying.

[4:33:46] FunGuyJulian: Fist monk is how I got 2100 in 2s, my first season in pvp lol
[4:33:59] youngfella: I just came up with an insane idea to make shuffle better. Instead of rotating players each round, let the 2 healers be captains and pick 2 dps to play 3 rounds with. one healer pick map first other pick a dps first. can u forward this to devs ty @venruki
[4:34:03] strafekey: I just don’t understand why blizz can’t incorporate some sort of 1 minute CD into the standard caster monk build where you can be offensive and heal from it for a bit.. monk would be such a diverse/fun healing spec
[4:34:05] FlyFYI: why not just make touch 5 and bub s5?
[4:34:08] gummyboiiiiii: gotcha haha i use those on priest
[4:34:40] Drockzoids: @FlyFYI Too much in the moment brain power when you're used to something else in the moment

[5:06:18] rbgsepp: Hey Ven ! How are you doing mate ? :) I have a question that i would love your thoughts on: In Todays world of boosting and botting all over the place it feels SUPER frustrating to even TRY to become good by just playing. People use Rotation Bots, use Scripts, use Autohotkey and SO much more and if not that they you find RK1 Boosters on 1800 Rating. How to find motvation to start and learn anyways "legit" ? :( it feels like a loosing battle especially when trying to heal etc
[5:06:20] meiscorn: remember this Song as the Title Song Form the Fighters?? FallWinning FallWinning FallWinning
[5:06:39] foxyllama: 13 = 1+3 = 4 but then if u take the +1+3+4 = 8 isnt that crazy that 8 does not equal 13
[5:07:30] YouAint_VeryBusy: @rbgsepp Low rated players dont know what a booster looks like. They just lose a game and stomp their feet and say booster!
