[1:03:29] Bamtko: the problem is that the player base is split way too much
[1:03:29] Wreckful_7: @bajheera Can we see your Xmog?
[1:03:43] Bamtko: between classic, and now solo shuffle and 3s
[1:04:19] Bamtko: i will forever stand on my opinion that solo shuffle is terrible for wow
[1:04:49] BaKuD0: Every modern game has a solo shuffle type MM  system
[1:04:56] Bamtko: wow isnt a modern game
[1:05:07] BaKuD0: Well it is
[1:05:09] Bamtko: its not like cod or league where random matchmaking IS the game
[1:05:09] BaKuD0: Its a live service
[1:05:18] BladeRalo: good luck with the legendary, do you think that the legendary is good for pvp?
[1:05:21] Bamtko: unless u make a private game with ppl
[1:05:51] Bamtko: for ppl that want an entry mode into 3s, solo shuffle teaches a watered down, unorganized and chaotic version of 3s that wont carry into the ladder
[1:05:54] woreski: are the graphics gonna look different i new xpac u think?
[1:06:11] Wreckful_7: @bajheera What Legendary you going for right now?
[1:06:24] Bamtko: the wait times are also out of this world, so if u come home from work and u gotta wait 45 mins to get into 1 game and then get flamed by someone else who also dont know what theyre doing its pretty obnoxious lol
[1:06:30] saynotofannypacks: this is the week, i feel it
[1:07:20] Wreckful_7: @bajheera  Do you only play alliance right now or you playin Horde too?
[1:07:46] Bamtko: and again like i said it splits the playerbase even more. there used to be this like endless cesspool of fotm rerollers that populated the lower brackets and that just doesnt exist, so another thing ppl complain abuot now is that theyre constatntly fighting multi glads at like 1800
[1:08:00] Bamtko: yeah
[1:08:10] Bamtko: ive said this since shadowlands when they announced it
[1:08:16] Bamtko: yeah
[1:08:20] Bamtko: itll be the same affect it had on 3s
[1:08:44] Toiarc: I dont think blizzard games have enough playerbase to maintain 2-3 versions of wow at sametime. Classics and retail.
[1:09:18] Bamtko: blizz also just didnt put enough tlc into solo shuffle
