[0:54:03] Corey_Burkhart: @DMachine52 Something that would be awesome to see in the future is "Playing with a player." Where we view the Arena game from that player's perspective. Example, you have an expert rogue here, having Pika onboard with Mir and giving us what he thinks the rogue is thinking about, watching the game from mir's perspective would be rad. (Similar to poker, playing a hand from 1 player's perspective :) )

[1:34:41] BackSeatBuilder: Blizzard-Activision is the most hated company in America
[1:34:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: Guys, give it a break. The "other" casters have different roles. The one just finished RWF, needs a break and the other mainly casts for MDI. There's nothing wrong here with having a all male panel for Classic Arena.
[1:34:48] Totos_Life: @thratzr make the chat mad
[1:34:49] lifeisanoogie: ACTIVISION BLIZZARD has done a great job of getting theSEXUAL aspects out of their game. i feared they wouldASSAULT us with constant scanty clothing. wouldn't want aLAWSUIT
[1:34:57] VannasTheRogue: @ChewieFlakes #doubt
[1:35:04] kavewow: actively subbing to this game enables the behavior that made a girl take her own life btw
