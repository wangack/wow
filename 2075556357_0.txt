[0:15:06] PinkTaricFTW: 2 games in a day is insane, tbh
[0:15:07] dustin_handsupdb: I mean intermittent fasting can help with that, higher energy when you're using it but still stay in a bit of a deficit.

[0:19:17] TheTestout: Hi @thetestout
[0:19:20] Zaisx: After hero talents you should look at the community council post about needing to change mythic raiding

[0:21:05] Lindorn_: reppy t
[0:21:05] jesuslouise: peepoAwesome
[0:21:10] dustin_handsupdb: @SpicyPete_ It's not ground loop, when it comes in its not in the 60Hz range. It's environmental noise caused by another circuit so when he adds an isolator the transformer itself picks up the noise too.
[0:21:12] ICGELoL: DOG
[0:21:14] IamBadSry: peepoHappy

[0:21:26] drem902: Which dog is that?
[0:21:28] itsheavydude: my wife and i signed up to foster dogs, pretty sure we will end up keeping them all

[0:21:42] braaahhh: xdd
[0:21:42] Archangel224: Is it just me that thinks people feel a bit entitled that they should be able to clear mythic, to me it should be good dedicated players/guilds that can, it's the hardest difficulty for a reason
[0:21:42] Nickystr1x: we dont need to but we certainly will

[0:22:14] gloop1: reppy t
[0:22:18] mr_jimbone: Warlock hero talents look pretty good. Destro in particular
[0:22:19] fronkacean: he is a very comedic lil guy
[0:22:21] ThreesFG: It worked out in the best and most obvious way
[0:22:23] smushez: We foster failed twice. it's pretty much a guarantee it will happen ... lol
[0:22:23] Korentice: dont let the other pups hear you saying that
[0:22:26] dabrink55: Max livin in the here and now

[0:23:20] Archangel224: Yeah for sure some good points in there ain't no doubt about it
[0:23:24] demizzle181: solid post
[0:23:27] SeraphimSentinel: It should be possible to not get CE even if you play the entire tier, which for a while hasnt been the case
[0:23:28] Jesdawow: it's overall a good post
[0:23:28] JiminyCracker: remove mythic lockout and its halfway fixed xdd
[0:23:45] leubinator: we can bet on how long he reads it before getting distracted cuz its to long and boring
[0:23:46] blowoutsale: which dog has more dps?
[0:23:54] its_blando: @SeraphimSentinel bro what, plenty of guilds dont clear
[0:23:56] pretlacik: today ? hero talents ?
[0:23:56] smolderdaddyuwu: The dude who wrote the article has been raiding since Vanilla @maximum
[0:24:05] alarkin: @SeraphimSentinel Literally thousands of guilds raid mythic each tier and don't come close to CE what on earth are you talking about
[0:24:15] elinius: GIGACHAD
[0:24:21] DanteDemonZ: I do think there is an overwhelming amount of mechanics and stuff going on and there shouldnt have to be constant nerfs because they should never have been so overtuned in the first place
[0:24:23] fronkacean: 1 tail whip from one of the danes and its over for him
[0:24:24] PhungusTV: he's not neutered???
[0:24:26] kamikazekid1213: Hes a cop of course hes the alpha
[0:24:26] alarkin: More guilds don't get CE but do raid mythic than those that do, and it's not even remotely close lol
[0:24:32] PepikStep: napoleon complex is strong with that one
[0:24:47] GooseComics: Who cares if they have  raided since vanillal.
[0:24:48] gwenmh: he's the alpha male
[0:24:50] Upsidedownsmiling: @Maximum your looking handsome and not fat today :)
[0:24:59] numnumss: Max i have a scottish terrier named Wilbert and he wears bowties, thoughts?
[0:25:01] smolderdaddyuwu: Raid leading* GM of Nascent or something
[0:25:09] its_blando: might as well just look at the post now ahahaa
[0:25:24] idkEric_: boh
[0:25:32] Guffels: I would rather heroic get harder than mythic get easier. Heroic taking 4 weeks and mythic taking 6 months is wild
[0:25:34] yourhoup: trueeeee
[0:25:43] yelp26: there will always be nerfs which is fine. just communicate better when those happen
[0:25:43] Gumbledore: Gumbledore subscribed with Prime. 
[0:25:44] Divine2987: what if I said they should never look at the top 100 guilds when designing content
[0:25:48] Nickystr1x: jb gonna be an honorary cat when wildstalker drops and he spends the entire xpac in cat form
[0:25:52] wallflower39: its a good post for the podcast
[0:25:52] SeraphimSentinel: Mid ass guilds have been clearing CE for like 8-10 tiers in a row without missing a single CE. Consistently clearing CE guilds are never worried about whether they are gonna get CE or not cause they know at the end of a tier the bosses will be nerfed into oblivion
[0:25:52] louki73: Yee Read it
[0:25:53] EppatTV: then why they tune raid for the top 100 guild and not for everyone else?
[0:26:00] captainnetz: It used to be nerfs in tandem with gear progression and now its just nerfs so it takes that natural curve of it out of the game
[0:26:06] Archangel224: Sorry for causing an aside there!
[0:26:08] zurendal: PepeLaugh
[0:26:21] BigTrout3: mythic raiding post says weakauras are good. therefore it's a good post
[0:26:26] LysFe: You will be un-juiced after all these promise
[0:26:27] JQ47: I heard the rouge one was amazing
[0:26:34] GooseComics: @EppatTV They don't . They nerfed it right away after the race was over.
[0:26:35] Hurbob14: @Maximum seems like blizzard is offering content for a wide wingspan of skill in this game. and i think thats a good thing
[0:26:37] Nickystr1x: sit back and take a deep breath before you start reading trickster lol
[0:26:40] 1_blase: these ones are good ones tho
[0:26:44] captainnetz: you're gonna spend hours on paladin alone lol
[0:26:50] NastieTV: Maybe someone already asked but, any talk about a new recruit for Liquid? =)
[0:26:52] Diakunn: Max did you see the gingi announcement?
[0:26:58] Hollowrogue: yeah
[0:27:01] GooseComics: @captainnetz doodClap doodClap doodClap doodClap doodClap doodClap doodClap
[0:27:08] Morayeden: "out of context"
[0:27:09] lonesomecowboy: people love to clip chimp hasan like crazy dude
[0:27:09] jesuslouise: classic streamer hating
[0:27:17] Theliahh: streamers Madge
[0:27:18] OGkush710: True
[0:27:24] OGkush710: He phrased it so poorly
[0:27:25] ver_flashbang: He made comparisons to other jobs in a follow up which was pretty stupid LuL
[0:27:30] Camelbak21: I mean he did say that exact same thing, he just expanded on it later when it backfired
[0:27:31] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, he did actually say it was worse.
[0:27:33] Nickystr1x: i feel like he gets done dirty by out of context clips so often
[0:27:33] 1_blase: oh god pls no, not this drama again
[0:27:34] TheItalianStallion321: hero talents. somehow, DH with 2 specs, not 1 has been released
[0:27:37] alarkin: @SeraphimSentinel This myth really needs to die. More guilds raid mythic and don't come close to CE than guilds that clear it - by a vast vast margin. If you clear CE, you are within about .5-1% of everyone who  plays wow and 5-10% of people who raid mythic
[0:27:43] OspreyRed: yeah, that is how people tend to feel
[0:27:55] dustin_handsupdb: It's like when my brain is fried from 12 hours at my desk and then some blue collar guy is like "oh you don't know real work" it's a different kinda tired
[0:28:01] GunsEvisu: hasan's got people doing hate campaigns against him
[0:28:07] malnourish_: everything is relative, and every job has downsides
[0:28:08] dorki: ppl mad
[0:28:17] blowoutsale: hes poggering
[0:28:19] Robohobbo: mad
[0:28:22] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Today we are once again reminded that monks are eternally the forgotten middle children of wow. They are going to be left over once again, held off until after the "main character" classes all have their full releases. I'm happy for the classes that have all of their versions out, and that blizz is already responding to their feedback, but it's disheartening to just not see the support for the monks here.
[0:28:22] Theliahh: dorki Susge
[0:28:25] braaahhh: woah
[0:28:25] MrChaCho: It's a know your audience type thing. What he said was valid probably, but that's some shit you talk about to your streamer friends. Not your viewers.
[0:28:26] DanteDemonZ: I'm over 150 wipes to Mythic Tindral now, meanwhile I look at my friends who play FFXIV and there is so much less going on screen and it's telegraphed way better
[0:28:28] Paandamonk1: @dorki so mad
[0:28:29] richisawesome: @dorki 's a grinder
[0:28:31] Dzor12: 4 hours is like the perfect amount, not too much, not too little
[0:28:32] Woeloen: woeloeHey
[0:28:35] blowoutsale: lot of paragraph andys here
[0:28:38] TDPandorum: Dorki Susge
[0:28:39] dustin_handsupdb: @alarkin This is correct, people seem to forget that the VAST majority of players in wow don't even clear normal.
[0:28:39] Sanctos304: what who's mad about what
[0:28:41] teddyytv_: I mean lets be real, the majority % of ppl will complain about their jobs now and then right.. legit doesnt matter what the job is
[0:28:43] b1azzuris: goddamn wish i could stop working whenever i got bored
[0:28:43] PurpleKami: yeah we watched you rip a 12 hour balatro stream
[0:28:51] fronkacean: @dorki poddyc finally a real podcast (first controversy)
[0:28:53] dorki: @teddyytv_ holy based firstGarf
[0:28:54] Zoulis: did people actually get mad about what you guys said in the poddyC?
[0:29:01] GooseComics: @Sanctos304 someone is mad about something on the internet!!!
[0:29:09] CloudyHS: 2 guyd gachiBASS
[0:29:13] hey_rooo: been fun watchin u play other shit with shroud n them
[0:29:13] TDPandorum: gard
[0:29:17] chadderz7: xddTree
[0:29:18] TheBlackDread: imagine being mad about that
[0:29:19] antipheonixna: hasan cant get away with the way he said it cause of his personality and type of content but theres truth and nuance in his take, like no jobs require you to actually constantly speak for 6-8hrs
[0:29:22] wallflower39: you should like the comment being mad
[0:29:25] braaahhh: gard
[0:29:27] CloudyHS: OMEGALUL
[0:29:27] ver_flashbang: People romanticise their hardship also way too much nowadays.

[0:29:45] spivet: @antipheonixna there are lots of non streamer jobs that involve talking all day. A lot of customer facing stuff, or call center work involves that
[0:29:46] BigTrout3: good chat
[0:29:48] b1azzuris: GIGACHAD
[0:29:54] chadderz7: Looking

[0:30:19] OspreyRed: what
[0:30:20] CloudyHS: :)
[0:30:22] TheItalianStallion321: definitely not political lol
[0:30:26] fronkacean: https://i.imgur.com/LhkLsin.png
[0:30:27] Zaisx: not politics, but politics pls
[0:30:29] FrilleJr: we need to know
[0:30:30] MakeMy_Day: the non politic putin interview
[0:30:39] CloudyHS: dude is a clown.
[0:30:42] dorki: people dont get it
[0:30:44] chadderz7: dude is a clown.
[0:30:52] Atarazza: That has "cant believe rage against the machine are so political these days" energy
[0:30:53] GandyKandie: this take is a clown take though
[0:30:57] gwenmh: max plays video games? since when?
[0:30:58] soth_klf: clowns lmao
[0:30:59] Theliahh: clown PepeLaugh

[0:31:12] BigTrout3: maximumClown
[0:31:14] Zoulis: Dude I love my job. But the second it became my job it stopped being my hobby. Wat?
[0:31:14] SkrrtRussel: meanwhile they also spend 9 hours a day on twitch, it's just unpaid
[0:31:15] Nickystr1x: HAH blud thinks he's "different. dude is aclown.
[0:31:16] GooseComics: I know a lot of people who love their job, that is not gaming or streaming, that feel the same @Maximum Its not uncommon tbh
[0:31:22] NerdRagedOut: PotFriend
[0:31:23] PinkTaricFTW: "Playing a game" and "streaming a game" is the same thing, obviously Kappa
[0:31:26] Zaisx: Max talks to chat for a living
[0:31:30] Paandamonk1: lowkey, if im gaming alone, i can only play for like 4 hours straight before i get bored, so i get it
[0:31:40] malnourish_: i'd the people who frequent this stream know that and appreciate you not milking it for $$$
[0:31:43] TheItalianStallion321: that is 1 hell of a bed @dorki
[0:31:47] malnourish_: i'd bet*

[0:31:52] PhungusTV: no one who has ever streamed for 5 minutes to an actual audience thinks its easy
[0:31:52] Rank_1_Idiot: do you think ele shaman will be considered humans in 11.0 or do we have to wait for 12.0
[0:31:54] rhithmx: entertainment is different than other industries, makes sense
[0:31:57] xrandomdoodx: good videos from Theun and Automatic Jak on defensive/ability bloat in WOW came out also
[0:31:57] themoocalls: why dont you guys stream poddy c anymore
[0:31:58] dabrink55: Max get a real job ya bum.
[0:31:59] scrimm77: im pretty sure you could stream yourself sleeping and people will still watch
[0:32:01] CloudyHS: hero talentussy
[0:32:01] Zaisx: The thought of streaming drains me ngl. Wouldn't want to do it, even if I could
[0:32:03] b1azzuris: do you think ele shaman will be considered humans in 11.0 or do we have to wait for 12.0
[0:32:03] yelp26: disregarding how "hard" you think streaming is, i think you have to aknowledge that it's atleast extremely mentally taxing
[0:32:03] menzlo: @maximum some people just want a familiar voice to listen to, so the bar for bad stream is really low
[0:32:05] DanteDemonZ: The Holy paladin talents give me hope it will be fun again
[0:32:09] zurendal: Max, Hes covering up that he is exhausted from the content he does, not the streaming. talking and argueing about politics 24/7 is draining, but not streaming
[0:32:09] celleryone: watching a bored streamer is a really bad experience true
[0:32:13] Diakunn: Did you guys know Tobo's favourite colour is orange?
[0:32:18] Robohobbo: @b1azzuris deleted in 11.0
[0:32:19] sprakk: I love that people are listening to The Midnight more often. The sax pwns
[0:32:23] Icycutes: dont be bored then :)
[0:32:30] ToxicLG: "Easy" is also an insanely relative term
[0:32:30] gwenmh: streaming is probably easy for like shroud, he's just a gaming elemental
[0:32:39] CloudyHS: @Maximum as a coal miner streaming is the hardest job
[0:32:40] GandyKandie: Draining and also Blessed
[0:32:41] dorki: its also easy to shit on streamers
[0:32:41] shanne111222: That caster voice is so annoying when he brings up her voice at random end of sentences tho
[0:32:42] b1azzuris: @Robohobbo we need the ele shaman emancipation proclamation
[0:32:46] dorki: cause theyre video gaming entertainers
[0:32:46] Trollolololed: If you have never grinded 8-10 hours a day of wow mythic+ for a week and then think, "What if I had to stream it," then you don't know how bad you want to log out after like the 5th day.
[0:32:52] ruuuudyyyy: fuck dorki btw
[0:32:58] Robohobbo: Ele shaman will get a passive that increases the gold generation from selling shit to NPCs and be delegated to gold farming
[0:32:58] fleks27: social vs physical energy also wildly differs
[0:33:00] Zoulis: I can see streaming being very mentally draining
[0:33:00] BarberBruh: BASED
[0:33:02] nullcyborg: @shanne111222 he also never interacts with his chat ever
[0:33:09] Casevw: Theres also no denying that talking for legit 8 hours straight tires your voice out and you dont want to physically speak after talking that long, outside of media facing jobs, you have time to rest your voice
[0:33:11] Zulfasaurus: hat gang LETSGO LETSGO MONKE NOTED
[0:33:12] fleks27: i didnt mind construction style work at all, streaming fucking ends me personally
[0:33:12] Line_0: People didn't even stop to listen to the argument
[0:33:13] Fray24_: it's easy to understand in context but folks are so focused on being mad they don't care about context
[0:33:17] MightyBone_Yumuros: The problem with hasan is that he comes from a rich family and he talks about working as he had ever had to do it
[0:33:17] Paandamonk1: @Maximum you should call growl, say "hey sorry i cant talk right now ill call you back" and hang up
[0:33:19] Rank_1_Idiot: do ele shamans deserve rights in TWW or do we have to wait for WoW Midnight
[0:33:21] ninja_in_red: yeah my social battery is not large enough for streaming at all
[0:33:26] winterstretch: you and hasan are my most watched streamers i think
[0:33:28] Robohobbo: I have indeed drove
[0:33:29] BickenBone: chat did max go over the trees yet
[0:33:30] wallflower39: yes i have drove
[0:33:30] gwenmh: hasan is basically what if echo fans trolled you outside of 3 weeks a year
[0:33:30] StupidAussieDrongo: i dont have a license
[0:33:31] pnguinwow: your stream is just a big ole podcast basically
[0:33:35] Robohobbo: dare I say, I have droven
[0:33:36] TirrinWoW: @fleks27 i feel the same
[0:33:40] ToxicLG: I am drove
[0:33:44] Shurafna: professional yapper (respectfully)
[0:33:44] Robohobbo: I drovened recently
[0:33:45] req_ttv: oh yeah, like unable to stay awake 5 hours into a drive but could play M+ for 6-8 hours
[0:33:46] OG_Kawngi: it depends where i drive, some routes require a crazy amount of micro decisions
[0:33:46] antipheonixna: imo its the constant speaking thats the exhausting part very few jobs requires constant talking like streaming
[0:33:52] auby6: with a real job alot of times its the working conditions too, like have you ever done roofing before its hot af
[0:33:57] StupidAussieDrongo: driving is cringe
[0:34:08] HammieMonster: I'm excited to see colossus warrior, not spoiling myself till max goes over it
[0:34:09] xdanielsooon: sorry bro get a tesla to stream for you
[0:34:17] zurendal: Talking about politcs 24/7
[0:34:24] Pyrrha_GG: driving you are also constantly making micro body adjustments to the movement of the car, but still a good comparison.
[0:34:24] GandyKandie: 1 v 2.5k coversation
[0:34:27] Line_0: Constant talking is exhausting
[0:34:29] ctesiph: sorry got here late, how long has Max been on? did he already go through the trees?
[0:34:29] OG_Kawngi: i wish
[0:34:29] GingerPAC: Imma leave mid surgery :)
[0:34:30] blowoutsale: you can take a sick day
[0:34:30] Robohobbo: imagine in residency you get tired and just leave
[0:34:31] ottermatic69: you also get to start your job whenever you want
[0:34:31] blowoutsale: leave early
[0:34:33] CloudyHS: hero talentussy time
[0:34:34] Robohobbo: like bruh no doc on call
[0:34:37] niji: Why are you saying haflway? if you are bored, that's the end of your so called shift
[0:34:43] skluer: imagine your in highschool and your teacher leaves because they are bored
[0:34:46] oqqiH: when i get bored i shit on company time
[0:34:46] Trollolololed: Over 150 dungeons in a week is just pain at the end. Couldn't imagine streaming it and trying to be entertaining.
[0:34:47] PhungusTV: there are many different ways to tax your brain and/or body and each of those will affect everyone differently. If someone tells you their job is hard, you should believe them
[0:34:47] LysFe: ITS TIME
[0:34:49] MrGharr: Train driver gets bored and leaves the train in the middle of nowhere
[0:34:49] Honeymunchz: I started working an hour ago and im both bored and tired of it
[0:34:49] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Today we are once again reminded that monks are eternally the forgotten middle children of wow. They are going to be left over once again, held off until after the "main character" classes all have their full releases. I'm happy for the classes that have all of their versions out, and that blizz is already responding to their feedback, but it's disheartening to just not see the support for the monks here.
[0:34:50] dustin_handsupdb: I can do that, I still gotta get stuff done by deadlines. I recognize the privilege I have but that doesn't mean you don't get to the end of the day with no brainpower left.
[0:34:50] Robohobbo: MADGE
[0:34:51] nudlerx: @ctesiph not started
[0:34:52] treyywow: you can go home whenever you want on the job site you just might not be able to come back brother

[0:52:16] BigTrout3: I'm sure leg sweep is 3. monk's cc is so good
[0:52:20] Divine2987: Asphyxiate

[0:52:31] maleific: Only wake of ashes
[0:52:32] arvantua: @Neomagam its 3
[0:52:32] L1ghtxyz: leg sweep is 3 in pve, 5 in pvp
[0:52:32] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Simply put all the offensive CDs shouldn't stack, so you're staggering them out instead of macroing them all together
[0:52:34] fleks27: why the fuck are people typing hoj is this a simulation
[0:52:34] panacer: cap totem is best aoe stun for duration iirc
[0:52:34] chadderz7: docnotL
[0:52:36] exomaths: chat smh
[0:52:37] Basic_3: I guess double cap totem is sort of longer?
[0:52:37] filipgreen7: yeah i thought leg sweap is still 5
[0:52:39] Divine2987: Sindergosas Fury
[0:52:40] logicaltty: KEKW everyone typing different numbers
[0:52:42] Mszemik1: hoj
[0:52:44] REDSUNDERGROUND: it would increase it to 5 sec

[0:52:46] lonesomecowboy: wake is only demons and undead though
[0:52:49] Kyrianel: Leg sweep is 3.
[0:52:50] GooseComics: lol
[0:52:51] ColdIceCreamMan: @fleks27 maybe it's a stimulation
[0:52:51] Hred5: vdh used to also be 5
[0:52:52] groom_of_the_stool_: what about fully stacked rouges
[0:52:55] Nickystr1x: @fleks27 what about stormbolt?
[0:52:56] BigTrout3: wow so this makes shockwave as good as every other group stun LMAO
[0:52:57] groom_of_the_stool_: with 6 combo points
[0:52:57] jonpelf: yah double cap totem still owns
[0:53:00] MitsuhideTenkai: @fleks27 did you miss the update?
[0:53:02] exomaths: Pepega hoj
[0:53:09] StupidAussieDrongo: 5% Size Increase is the best hero talent theyve added, fight me
[0:53:11] smolderdaddyuwu: Also @maximum Critcske said of the hero talents was quote "very mid."
[0:53:11] xrandomdoodx: Arms taking earthquake from Ele Kappa
[0:53:12] REDSUNDERGROUND: ret also has hammer  of  justice which  is 5  sec
[0:53:14] dharma66: hoj best though
[0:53:17] Hred5: hmm
[0:53:20] ovenproof: shockwave will also be easier to take now too
[0:53:20] gfkoe: @REDSUNDERGROUND that is not an aoe
[0:53:20] Lothland: That is really good
[0:53:20] Hred5: that seems useless no?
[0:53:22] gamatommy: Earthquaker better
[0:53:23] mikethaisson: sick for m+
[0:53:24] thiccsushi: Ele shaman in shambles
[0:53:27] KingRozay: @Maximum synergy with yasuo ult
[0:53:27] jannekvarnc: DR
[0:53:27] EppatTV: pvp?
[0:53:28] gamatommy: stun dr
[0:53:28] Its_Just_Pete: DR
[0:53:29] wallflower39: dr
[0:53:30] DeadBesidE: why you need stun + knock
[0:53:30] thenateo2: dr
[0:53:31] sheckles: Knockups cant dr
[0:53:31] klappe92: stund dr stop
[0:53:31] OneEyeWay: the talent that makes shockwave 25 seconds when u hit three targets gonna go crazy
[0:53:32] Deux_wow: z axis gaming
[0:53:33] yo_its_lt: DR
[0:53:33] Holytronic: They are adding Yasuo to WoW
[0:53:34] duplexity_dave: doesn't contest with DR from other classes
[0:53:35] panacer: pvp and DR
[0:53:35] ColdIceCreamMan: doesn't dr
[0:53:36] REDSUNDERGROUND: @gfkoe ah didnt hear  aoe XD
[0:53:36] themadcatzzz: yasuo ult
[0:53:37] Kyrianel: Stun immune?
[0:53:38] Brotholomew13: Does that mean you don't get stun DR?
[0:53:38] tommista: for the yasuo ult
[0:53:39] Korentice: interrupts non-stunable enemies?
[0:53:39] fumii_tv: does the stun happen after the knock up
[0:53:40] Himot: Yasuo ult
[0:53:41] Zephn: Airtime doesn't DR
[0:53:43] Faraday5001: Lore stun Pog
[0:53:44] filipgreen7: oooooh
[0:53:45] chadderz7: style points xdd
[0:53:45] Hred5: but it still stuns tho??
[0:53:48] Pyrrha_GG: can some mobs not be stunned but can be knocked?
[0:53:49] thatoneguynobodylikes352: And you can augment to chain the root into a stun.
[0:53:50] Divine2987: Aug Synergy if the Knock Up stun talent becomes good
[0:53:51] Vexxel: typed too fast and put 4 instead of 3 LUL
[0:53:51] Thatsabann: what if stun immuine but knock works
[0:53:51] MoleDude: it says also though? so its a stun and knock
[0:53:52] Nyraell: "also" meaning it still stuns. no?
[0:53:55] kamikazekid1213: Like thunderstorm for shaman
[0:53:57] gfkoe: Idk if the knock would happen if they are on stun dr tho
[0:53:58] Hred5: but it woudl stun AND knock
[0:54:01] Zynathmung: thats not a pvp option or maybe just BGs
[0:54:05] thatoneguynobodylikes352: They have their root that turns into a stun if someone is airborne.
[0:54:10] gwenmh: what if shaman become playable
[0:54:10] jonpelf: evoker has a talent that stuns mobs already in the air too
[0:54:11] zurendal: cant parry in the air?
[0:54:13] Hred5: right but wouldn't that still DR?
[0:54:19] v1k1n6: it is good against Ras orbs
[0:54:22] prupple: removes 2 stacks of razageth orbs :D
[0:54:24] adardrae: knock should go farther if they're in midair
[0:54:24] exomaths: @gwenmh haha
[0:54:27] L1ghtxyz: or knock up and then stun when they fall
[0:54:30] chadderz7: monkaHmm
[0:54:31] rilsolo: or shoots them into the air then stunning them
[0:54:34] JakeParkbench: Aftershock would be cool
[0:54:38] Aemon__: are there mobs that cant be stunned but can be displaced?
[0:54:38] Brotholomew13: Oh its like an aftershock
[0:54:41] Brotholomew13: dope
[0:54:42] MitsuhideTenkai: that would be sick
[0:54:46] mantooth11: maybe knock up works on some mobs that can't be stunned
[0:54:51] lordnavol: warriors should have heroism/bloodlust
[0:54:54] Isonmat: is this the first tree max has gone over?
[0:54:55] antipheonixna: what if earthquaker is a dps increase tho SUSSY
[0:54:59] gamatommy: thunderstorm
[0:54:59] PinkTaricFTW: sunder
[0:55:04] Clevelandmk: did they popped more dk tree?
[0:55:07] NooboniousPrime: Thunderstorm
[0:55:11] mentoku: @Isonmat yes
[0:55:11] the_hessman: or knocks them up and when they land are stunned
[0:55:12] faynewar: warriors are turning int shaman :(
[0:55:14] Kyrianel: I do believe its for mobs that either cannot be stunned or interrupted, but the movement would interrupt casting.
[0:55:19] btdubs15: does it do the aug thing where it kind of groups stuff
[0:55:24] rhithmx: works with stun DR
[0:55:27] the_great_simonator: @Clevelandmk still only the vamp one :(
[0:55:31] numnumss: sounds like its gunna be like garrosh's Q from hots
[0:55:43] genovis1: you also get 5 sec CDR on it
[0:55:57] Brotholomew13: @genovis1 oh yeah tru
[0:55:59] leubinator: i hate that shockwave talents are locked in a hero talent and not in the classtree where they should be
[0:55:59] stumie: warlocks PepeLaugh
[0:56:00] Rzayers: how many trees has he done?
[0:56:05] gfkoe: rogue tree
[0:56:07] gloomygl: defensive for hunter ? Pog
[0:56:08] Riot_Blacktimus: Realz said there is one dedicated defensive node for each tree
[0:56:08] SkunkTruck: would you use that as arms biuld? seems like they are doing these warrior talents based on a redone talent tree
[0:56:12] BigTrout3: warlocks
[0:56:13] TheeDucksays: no; there is a huge benefit to having variable *types* of cc. shaman can avoid knockup. others can avoid stun
[0:56:14] smorblomman92: wait til you see lock
[0:56:14] ColdIceCreamMan: @Rzayers first one. he started from the bottom
[0:56:22] MrGharr: wait until you see warlock
[0:56:23] wraghelm: warlock and rogue got a defensive buff
[0:56:27] Brotholomew13: Arms ignore pain zzz
[0:56:28] knersh_: prune defs
[0:56:28] Rzayers: @ColdIceCreamMan lit got here in time
[0:56:28] Pyrrha_GG: they could also be pulling defensiveness out of class/spec tress
[0:56:34] just_ie: As an enhance main i have never taken cudgel over static charge. Not a single situation has made sense for double stun rather than having stun way more often.
[0:56:35] exomaths: Old second wind Pog
[0:56:35] NooboniousPrime: Shaman needs big defensive abilities. Their class talent tree is only more hp or more healing taken, but they still die to big hits
[0:56:37] ovenproof: these defensives kinda suck
[0:56:41] StupidAussieDrongo: the next talent is the best hero talent theyve added
[0:56:43] gamatommy: both are bad but IP one is the only one u take
[0:56:55] BigTrout3: but arms actually LOST ignore pain so this point is weird
[0:56:57] SkunkTruck: hopefully these are based on a reworked talent tree
[0:57:09] Brotholomew13: Oh no way
[0:57:09] headninja1ncharge: headninja1ncharge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:57:14] MrGharr: total
[0:57:23] gigaerick: when they announced the hero trees they specifically said that every choice node would have 1 choice that doubles down on the tree, and the other would be something else like a defensive
[0:57:26] thendj: second wind is 10x better
[0:57:26] DayOldBeef: not to sound downer, but as a priest I don't want DR in my hero tree, why should our class lose out of creative DPS nodes to make up for lack of meaningful DR in our class tree, instead we just have garbage in our class tree and then a DR in hero tree.
[0:57:33] Raggu2: "low"
[0:57:40] BigTrout3: I thought arms and fury don't get ignore pain?
[0:57:41] exomaths: cata i think
[0:57:41] thenateo2: mop
[0:57:41] Taytor: WoD
[0:57:41] StupidAussieDrongo: MOP Yes
[0:57:42] GodKingMuninn: MoP Second Wind was absurd
[0:57:44] flebbooo: mop
[0:57:45] yeesper: wod
[0:57:46] jannekvarnc: can they just use % like what is low xd
[0:57:46] dBison24: mop
[0:57:47] StupidAussieDrongo: MOP Warrior was UNKILLABLE
[0:57:48] potionirl: mop
[0:57:48] GooseComics: WOD i think.
[0:57:48] gfkoe: mop and wod
[0:57:49] thenateo2: reckful with second wind was insanely op
[0:57:50] ovenproof: new second wind is not good tho
[0:57:51] Zoulis: ill'gynoth in nyalotha :V
[0:57:54] leubinator: second wind is on the tree
[0:57:54] 404fnf: should i come back to wow
[0:57:54] caveman2x: it still bangs tbh
[0:57:59] Tey12: it was good on the football boss in bfa also
[0:58:04] JustDivis: Cata or mop had perma second wind under 35% hp
[0:58:04] chadderz7: TrollDespair
[0:58:06] Tey12: the aoe dmg didn't break it
[0:58:11] ovenproof: second wind is only good for like bursting affix
[0:58:12] Fleymour: they still have it. but current every boss breaks it @Maximum
[0:58:12] Gotoi: Did you see the Gingi annoucement?!
[0:58:14] clickermekk: second wind is nice but "Low" chance isnt good to rely on
[0:58:26] sweetingsting: out of combat heal now
[0:58:27] Brotholomew13: yeah now you have to not take damage for several seconds, only good for leveling
[0:58:39] Fleymour: "Restores 6% health every 1 sec when you have not taken dmg for 5 sec" .. current version
[0:58:54] Gumbledore: we used to press it a lot :(

[0:59:17] Wildfire_Gaming: 5% more likely to stand in fire GIGACHAD
[0:59:17] the_great_simonator: that's awesome
[0:59:18] cjellex: does size matter for any aoe effects?
[0:59:18] BobAwesome: Since they removed Ignore Pain from ToM interaction, pretty sure no one takes it for pve anymore
[0:59:18] braaahhh: big bad mfer
[0:59:19] Paandamonk1: gotta go tauren for that
[0:59:20] OperationSena: @gotoi  what was it??
[0:59:20] prupple: buff size 5-20%
[0:59:21] JustRewind: Thats really cool actually
[0:59:22] retroactiveadmiralthrawn: Does the 5% increase hit box though?
[0:59:23] Milanesa_De_Pollo: HUH
[0:59:24] UnheardGrace: slightly taller dwarf warriors incoming
[0:59:25] BigTrout3: that's the lore type talents we need

[0:59:30] chadderz7: tauren warr HOLY
[0:59:31] captainkirbal: gnome warriors rise up
[0:59:31] frostysjazz: How do you think about the channel time for the first ability?
[0:59:31] Warador117: Blizz really sayin size matters
[0:59:31] brosciencegym: toadphMadge toadphMadge toadphMadge
[0:59:35] frostysjazz: I got here late lol
[0:59:37] MrGharr: 5% size is not really noticable on a gnome warrior
[0:59:45] thiccsushi: Tauren stonks
[0:59:48] jandemain: has he looked at all the other trees?
[0:59:49] 1kemba: i like it big
[0:59:54] wraghelm: 5% on gnome makes them Tauren size
[0:59:55] Zephn: BIG
[0:59:56] StupidAussieDrongo: @MrGharr no more gnome u r dwarf now
[0:59:57] shizuma_lol: @jandemain no
[0:59:57] pnguinwow: imagine that driney thing but 5% bigger
[1:00:01] Mszemik1: @jandemain Its the first one
[1:00:02] Brotholomew13: @Maximum They should have made it so that you gain 1% size per stack of Colossal Might. Huge boys
[1:00:03] Gumbledore: gameplay is better for dps warrior than thane was but theme is not as strong imo
[1:00:05] Spafuncio: Bignomes
[1:00:11] captainkirbal: @mrgharr Don’t disrespect the 5%
[1:00:14] jandemain: ok ty
[1:00:15] GooseComics: Colossus tree so far is pretty much a solid A for me.
[1:00:16] empioxd: @Maximum no interest in last epoch?
[1:00:20] rukt: slayer has to do with execute i think
[1:00:23] BickenBone: cool tree
[1:00:24] gwenmh: slayer is normal sized - unplayable
[1:00:27] MrGharr: should be more like 2% per stack
[1:00:29] Primit1ve: Hopefull big dam in CS
[1:00:31] LucasSterling_: slayer = big execute
[1:00:32] wraghelm: i am going to power level to that 5% size gain
[1:00:35] goodmonsin: ret trees feel like they will do that I think
[1:00:35] braaahhh: so prot picks between this or the lightning one?
[1:00:37] klappe92: OR make the size increase related to colossal might charges so you grow progressively bigger until you blow your massive demolish load on the enemies Pog
[1:00:38] Warador117: why play slayer when they arent big?
[1:00:41] DukePiewalker: Slayer gonna be execute bonanza 100%
[1:00:42] abomlol: hope we get cool new flourishes
[1:00:42] Zephn: If demolish does big damage, it could be huge for arms since it's a low CD and works in aoe
[1:00:45] exomaths: @braaahhh yes
[1:00:59] captainkirbal: @warador117 5Head
[1:01:03] Brotholomew13: Slayer is going to be bleed/execute themed right
[1:01:05] LordFFlink: is this the last tree?
[1:01:15] pnguinwow: does a size increase make it so you can hit hitboxes from farther away?
[1:01:30] thatboyjem: Current enhance would slap p2 Sylvanas now
[1:01:34] Valgus92: Same animation as Fyralath I bet
[1:01:37] benzou2: @Brotholomew13 Damn, I hope so. Execute themed especially
[1:01:37] FroTheBeard: @LordFFlink He started at the bottom, this is the first he's gone over
[1:01:39] SkunkTruck: oh good question @pnguinwow
[1:01:42] BobAwesome: Probably just gonna look like a Rampage animation
[1:01:42] Nickystr1x: bigmen
[1:01:42] KaisenSiru: Colossus Pog
[1:01:44] exomaths: Plz add new animations and spell effects blizz
[1:01:45] Frozenbozo: This tree lives and dies on demolish feeling good

[1:01:58] Parduke: Big Boi time
[1:01:58] Skingkong: @Heavynerf1234 not yet
[1:02:05] Fleymour: quiet boring imo .. + no cool spell
[1:02:05] erdls: size increase is the best talent, finally my gf can be satisfied
[1:02:06] Morayeden: It only took 2 years
[1:02:18] captainkirbal: arms doesn’t mind more complexity but this is nice extra baked in to the rotation power
[1:02:20] logain_13: @XortiqDN You can take all points. Only choice is choice nodes
[1:02:26] Basic_3: Diabolist has a dev note in the feedback article. "Diabolic Ritual is cyclical, starting with Overlord and ending with Pit Lord. So, when you summon a demon it will always be in the order of: Overlord, then Mother of Chaos, then Pit Lord, and then Diabolic Ritual will cycle back to Overlord."
[1:02:29] toastbam: shockwave should just be given to warriors, screw this having to take it in talents
[1:02:32] Line_0: power isnt interesting atm yeah
[1:02:43] Brotholomew13: Mountain Thane sounding very meh
[1:02:52] CloudyHS: NO
[1:02:53] GooseComics: @Maximum Which do you think is a bigger winner for Colossus? Arms or Prot?

[1:03:03] Zephn: Power can be changed but they don't change your damage profile on a whim usually, so demolish has some really cool potential
[1:03:03] Jazzarus_: YEEEES
[1:03:03] 1kemba: i would like that yes
[1:03:04] Entenstein_: i just dont want it to make my rotation worse
[1:03:05] Frozenbozo: Gameplay change not necessarily power
[1:03:06] Morayeden: If not, why have power in them at all?
[1:03:07] Parduke: NO
[1:03:07] Neugd: yes
[1:03:08] honeychonker: No
[1:03:09] Tsylent: no
[1:03:11] antipheonixna: imo goal is to not bloat the class but give a new playstyle or strong thematic improvement
[1:03:12] bagelflinger: Mountain Thain should get 5% decrease in size
[1:03:13] Guffels: I want the effect to be so cool and high defensive.
[1:03:14] Vexxel: absolutely not
[1:03:15] Orenria: All I want from prot pally is for a hero talent to fix consecration
[1:03:15] benzou2: This should be fun especially
[1:03:15] dBison24: @wtfrickrolled no u!
[1:03:16] Basic_3: @Pinslate maximumBeakless
[1:03:17] celleryone: No, the stated goal of these is to not change too much for you spec or class
[1:03:19] spivet: I think preheat said devs were aiming at 10-20% of your damage
[1:03:19] TripHH: just prefer arms to be reworked still as a main lol tree seems ok
[1:03:20] maleific: Hero talents are literally class specific soulbinds.
[1:03:20] wraghelm: like a different tier set
[1:03:21] Theliahh: doubling the number of specs is not good
[1:03:21] Parduke: is transmog extra
[1:03:23] brandogzz: Well warriors really need a rework first before i hype this, warrior is the most iconic class in the game it was untouched all of DF
[1:03:23] adardrae: they should change gameplay and be minor increases
[1:03:23] honeychonker: MEANINGFUL CHOICES
[1:03:24] Brotholomew13: @Maximum How much power should they have? 5% overall?
[1:03:26] filipgreen7: so covenants 2.0? :D
[1:03:27] darkgigaz: Just flavor for specs
[1:03:27] dozure: as it stands they are pointless and not cool at all tho
[1:03:29] SkunkTruck: theme i dont care about. my theme is Max Dps
[1:03:34] JustRewind: I just want thematics to be on point, and I REALLY  hope that blizzard can accomplish their goal of making all hero talents comparable so there isn't as much meta.
[1:03:34] Jazzarus_: Dont care about power but I want to feel I'm playing a whole different spec
[1:03:35] RocketTanks: As hero talents they should feel heroic.
[1:03:38] rejvie: power swing = you will be stuck with 1 because its just better on sims
[1:03:38] Lyonidus: a lot of these are gonna get nerfed HARD
[1:03:40] Da_Booshh: I want there to be a reason for me to want to have 2 Arms Warriors. One Slayer and One Colossus
[1:03:40] JakeParkbench: augmenting the base playstyle with maybe a cool big button to press
[1:03:42] BigTrout3: this is where Blizzard should go lore crazy
[1:03:42] ahri_feet_connoisseur: in a perfect world where Blizz can balance, I do want it to be as impactful as possible
[1:03:43] Parkreiner: power is whatever, they need to change the gameplay from spec to spec
[1:03:44] Vexxel: @Pinslate moon2GUMS
[1:03:46] darkgigaz: Sp
[1:03:47] thiccsushi: 10-20% is huge
[1:03:47] Dengara: rip shamans again Kappa
[1:03:49] Tsaebahcus007: Im very curious about hd
[1:03:50] Shpicey: wait what is this i thought this was a balatro streamer
[1:03:50] Tsaebahcus007: dh*
[1:03:51] miqquellla: there will be
[1:03:52] XellSamurai: Demo lock seems broken af
[1:03:53] Nickystr1x: I SURE HOPE NO ONE HAS TO USE THEIR DEFENSIVES FOR DPS
[1:03:54] oceanic22: prolly ele
[1:03:54] brandogzz: Well warriors really need a rework first before i hype this, warrior is the most iconic class in the game it was untouched all of DF
[1:03:55] BigTrout3: more 5% size nodes
[1:03:59] Jazzarus_: paladins are good imo
[1:04:00] Parduke: hero talents = transmog++ and that is good
[1:04:01] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Rogue one is BADGE
[1:04:02] Scoop262: diabolist GIGACHAD
[1:04:02] UnheardGrace: do evoker next!
[1:04:04] BbreakGaming: what have I missed chat?!
[1:04:05] ArcaneSyntax: I kinda dig the paladin ones tbh
[1:04:05] JustRewind: @Maximum Diabolist has an important clarification in the feedback thread. The demons are cyclical, Overlord -> Mother of Chaos -> Pit Lord.
[1:04:05] SloppyWalrus_: rogue
[1:04:06] 1kemba: rogue tree Aware
[1:04:08] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Like bigly badge
[1:04:09] sibrobro: xdd
[1:04:09] flebbooo: WideTHD ?
[1:04:14] LCS01: @1kemba facts
[1:04:15] Squats3: @Maximum is it a hot take to just be of the opinion that these sub spec's just add more bloat that we dont need
[1:04:16] Trodenskjold: Boomie tree.  Just skip that
[1:04:18] raye_gaming22: summon the man
[1:04:22] RocketTanks: I think it sucks for Druid that bear and cat are on different trees.
[1:04:33] MrGharr: where is THD?
[1:04:34] asd123qwerty1: rouge Aware
[1:04:36] Zaisx: one node is real bad, but the rest of this is cool
[1:04:36] brandogzz: Boomie tree is super below avrage
[1:04:37] nanerpus_: You say that, but even if it was a 3-5 % damage difference, people would still be super toxic about not picking the best. Its like doing keys and you see 18s only taking meta comps
[1:04:43] Aro725: @ArcaneSyntax besides the sun spots, gotta change that name lol.
[1:04:44] MofuLord: @asd123qwerty1 the bat?
[1:04:46] Trodenskjold: @brandogzz Good
[1:04:48] brandogzz: Needs rework
[1:04:54] noewon: D: trents are cool
[1:04:55] smushez: druid bear/cat hve a tree coming
[1:05:00] benzou2: @Aro725 bald spots?
[1:05:10] dorki: very often
[1:05:11] bobshallot: balance druid ResidentSleeper
[1:05:11] klanker: moon moons?
[1:05:13] smushez: a lot
[1:05:15] Mszemik1: one every 3 minutes
[1:05:15] Trodenskjold: Once a month
[1:05:17] Mythos24: It's just part of hte roation right?
[1:05:19] wtfrickrolled: Full moons are once a montyh
[1:05:20] prupple: once per 15-20 secs
[1:05:20] asd123qwerty1: @mofulord huh?
[1:05:21] headninja1ncharge: It is procc'd and casted
[1:05:23] Xelrathos: 20 sec cd?
[1:05:24] burne114: @dorki lol dont ask the tank main he dosn;t know
[1:05:24] FroTheBeard: is it 3 per minor moons? So 6 power?
[1:05:30] dreadPack: In cooldowns
[1:05:32] TheItalianStallion321: @Trodenskjold lmao i was highly thinking of saying that
[1:05:33] iAruban: @Mszemik1 ??
[1:05:34] thendj: lunar beam you never cast bc you cant get
[1:05:41] xxMaverick: full moon only chat
[1:05:55] pnguinwow: this is the perfect dorki tree he plays both of these
[1:05:56] MofuLord: @asd123qwerty1 search your spelling of "rouge" on google images, lmao
[1:05:57] JakeParkbench: please make it good for the love of god
[1:06:01] Lrauq: important note: full moon and fury of elune are a choice node for balance right now
[1:06:14] Nickystr1x: donki beams
[1:06:15] CloudyHS: BASED
[1:06:20] antipheonixna: a lot of trees are trying to enhance the gameplay of certain buttons or make a current button a main button, think thats cool
[1:06:29] SamuelWiise: im waiting for him to slip and call it ass power
[1:06:53] klanker: Adge
[1:06:56] ColdIceCreamMan: not really
[1:07:08] braaahhh: just natty dam hopefully
[1:07:09] headninja1ncharge: You're always casting wrath
[1:07:09] Lrauq: depends on the next node
[1:07:11] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:07:11] TDPandorum: Adge
[1:07:12] Paandamonk1: assuming passive?
[1:07:14] storm7elemental: passive off wrath pretty much
[1:07:15] BigTrout3: thrash does arcane damage
[1:07:17] FerosGW2: chat is this for next xpac?
[1:07:18] smushez: probably not - more passive because it wont change your lunar/solar phase
[1:07:19] thiccsushi: dorkiCozy
[1:07:20] Zaisx: lunar calling is bad
[1:07:26] Fmjx_: passive/natty tbh. you normally wrath spam before surge dumping anyways
[1:07:28] SamuelWiise: yeah thats just wrath and sunfire
[1:07:29] prupple: makes solar eclipse better than lunar eclipse better on 2 targets
[1:07:37] braaahhh: HUH
[1:07:47] TotallyNotRaien: why...
[1:07:48] Jesdawow: thrash doing arcane damage seems natty
[1:07:50] bigoldmeatpie: you're in perma lunar eclipse
[1:07:53] ColdIceCreamMan: starfire is filler aoe, and it doesn't proc the phase where wrath deals more dam
[1:07:54] Exasperated_: its kinda weird
[1:07:55] gwenmh: you are never going into solar eclipse (single target)
[1:07:55] Paandamonk1: so they just wouldnt go solar
[1:08:01] JakeParkbench: guardian looks dope so far
[1:08:05] storm7elemental: you would never cast wrath with that
[1:08:07] antipheonixna: u lunar in ST and solar is yeeted
[1:08:11] braaahhh: solar eclipse is ST, lunar is AOE
[1:08:12] headninja1ncharge: This is them testing just removing solar eclipse because we dont use it
[1:08:18] dreadPack: Eclipses are dobie rn
[1:08:19] Parduke: doesn't that mess with passive in tree above
[1:08:20] smushez: arcane bear sounds so good im scared they are gonna ruin it lol...
[1:08:21] Cazacon109: @storm7elemental i mean you cast 2 wraths for lunar eclipse
[1:08:22] Paandamonk1: im not upset about that
[1:08:23] Nickystr1x: beambear gang
[1:08:25] gwenmh: you only caast wraths to get into lunar
[1:08:28] Brotholomew13: Ohhhh if Guardian gets a different thrash animation
[1:08:39] Zaisx: but the starfire only does more damage to the primary target, so good for prio? idk
[1:08:40] storm7elemental: @Cazacon109 yeah i meant for single target but yes, you'd just stay lunar all day
[1:08:49] Aro725: Boomkins in shmables, only class to see both trees and they both seem mid
[1:08:54] CloudyHS: yo dawg i heard you like moons
[1:09:00] TotallyNotRaien: moon wont feel like a word anymore soon
[1:09:00] sibrobro: lol
[1:09:04] Teloh: moon2M moon
[1:09:05] abomlol: Thanos Bear
[1:09:08] ColdIceCreamMan: it's like a final fantasy boss
[1:09:13] PoorKarma17: Moonmoon
[1:09:13] simp1e1: I love moons
[1:09:21] antipheonixna: reject sun embrace moon
[1:09:24] Paandamonk1: what does lunar beam do?
[1:09:30] GIGA_DAD_OFHELL: moon2M moons?
[1:09:34] filipgreen7: yeah guardian with these moons and shit seems fun
[1:09:39] st1nkb0tt0m: MOON BEAR STONKS ARE SOOOO HIGH
[1:09:41] nanerpus_: this all kind of sounds like a lot more clutter on the screen
[1:09:44] JakeParkbench: +6 Pog
[1:09:44] TheItalianStallion321: 6 rage. is this classic?
[1:09:44] balddy321: @Maximum lunar beam now has good synergy and interesting interaction with current tier
[1:09:46] Faraday5001: 6 HOLY
[1:09:46] Raggu2: needs a  0
[1:09:48] slappygilmore_: probably 6 rage per tick?
[1:09:49] Raggu2: 60
[1:09:55] ColdIceCreamMan: 6 per tick?
[1:10:02] MagicPants_99: 6 per tick i would guess?
[1:10:04] TheItalianStallion321: @Raggu2 i see you
[1:10:08] Zaisx: boomie just gets a ton of AP in this tree
[1:10:14] akerlnd: Doesn't Lunar Beam just feel like a weird Consecration?
[1:10:20] Raggu2: @TheItalianStallion321 slootRoll
[1:10:30] storm7elemental: just more passive damage and economy for boomkin it seems, not bad, not insane, should be fun to watch passive damage go off
[1:10:33] TheItalianStallion321: @Raggu2 slootRoll slootRoll
[1:10:37] headninja1ncharge: Thats bonkers
[1:10:45] Gummy4907: bear can heal off of arcane damage
[1:10:47] smushez: sounds like maybe offering something in between AOE adn single. balance doesnt have a ton of cleave... maybe trying to achieve that?? idk
[1:10:50] Zaisx: that does seem good
[1:10:52] gwenmh: this tree is like 3% spell resist, 6% arcane resist lol
[1:10:58] Zaisx: just beams everywhere on AoE
[1:11:02] brandogzz: Thats the one note that actually seems good
[1:11:05] gronthrain: I hope all these abilities get animations xd
[1:11:08] bigoldmeatpie: multiple moonfires calling fury of elune then all of those exploding is amazing
[1:11:12] brandogzz: moonfire chance on beam
[1:11:14] zarrzxtv: is jpc coming for rogue?
[1:11:21] Fraxien: xdd
[1:11:22] surfazing_: glizzy fur
[1:11:24] Zaisx: arcane dmg KEKW
[1:11:24] LionButLeon: ARCANE???? BatChest
[1:11:27] BickenBone: ???
[1:11:32] thiccsushi: 6% arcane dr PogChamp
[1:11:34] exomaths: so interesting Pog
[1:11:35] Saahf: 3% AINTNOWAY
[1:11:36] BickenBone: ARCANE
[1:11:37] adardrae: it's trinket text
[1:11:38] Raggu2: Void enemies probly do arcane damage
[1:11:40] JakeParkbench: I will say this will cause you to build your bear tree pretty one way
[1:11:45] LionButLeon: I HECKING LOVE ARCANE! BatChest
[1:11:46] gwenmh: lol
[1:11:46] zurendal: arcane raid incoming
[1:11:48] Trodenskjold: Countering arcane mages in pvp Pog
[1:11:55] LionButLeon: @Trodenskjold holy 5Head
[1:12:01] Paandamonk1: 3% for raid, 8% for m+?
[1:12:01] celleryone: 3% easy no brain choice
[1:12:02] smushez: agreed
[1:12:03] LucasSterling_: its like 3% avoidance
[1:12:13] BickenBone: regrowth doesnt do damage :)
[1:12:15] Paandamonk1: depends on damage profile tho
[1:12:36] sibrobro: regrowth is 1 gcd so id take 3%
[1:12:40] Parduke: bubble gum shams
[1:12:42] Zaisx: 30% HOLY
[1:12:43] Bollash: If I wanted to spend globals on defensiveness I'd go bear
[1:12:49] dreadPack: Pvp talent
[1:12:51] LionButLeon: perma slow Pepog
[1:12:54] LucasSterling_: that would go hard on sanguine
[1:12:59] LionButLeon: @LucasSterling_ OMEGALUL
[1:13:01] headninja1ncharge: 30% is insane
[1:13:05] yassydk: Its also not just arcane damage, it will likely be multi school typed damages as well. Not saying its good but its probably not just isolated to one spell type
[1:13:06] MBG_95: I mean Bear druids have a better one already??
[1:13:09] LionButLeon: yea no
[1:13:12] JamesTiedye: Sanguine buff Pog
[1:13:21] Scoops__: ehhhhh
[1:13:22] dreadPack: That's awesome
[1:13:23] Zzekar: like never
[1:13:25] Nickystr1x: bear kinda a bit
[1:13:28] Lrauq: 15 -> 12 does not suck
[1:13:28] filipgreen7: almost never
[1:13:30] simp1e1: its already a super short cd
[1:13:30] LionButLeon: i mean for bear its good, moonkin is w/E
[1:13:34] Basic_3: Its mostly the ability to turn odd the slow
[1:13:34] smushez: not often enough on moonkin.
[1:13:37] gloop1: the whole node is a pvp node
[1:13:39] BickenBone: seems both are pvp options
[1:13:42] xrader858: balance guardian
[1:13:45] potionirl: boomy needed a slow in pvp
[1:13:51] braaahhh: 3 seconds is 20% CDR
[1:13:55] dreadPack: Moonkin uses it to reduce movement and keep casting
[1:13:58] GooseComics: Does it though?
[1:13:58] captainnetz: its not fine remove pvp
[1:14:04] Blut103: pvp KEKHeim
[1:14:05] LionButLeon: @captainnetz baseg
[1:14:12] krissis_: moondust would be nuts for the balance mage tower challenge
[1:14:17] storm7elemental: onlymoons
[1:14:18] smushez: yes plez
[1:14:19] khaste_G: YEP
[1:14:21] GandyKandie: wonder where i am going to get the point to take lunar beam with this current class tree
[1:14:21] braaahhh: gachiBASS FUCK THE SUN
[1:14:22] Teloh: fuck da sun only moon2M
[1:14:27] Wildfire_Gaming: as a ginger i agree, fuck the sun
[1:14:27] headninja1ncharge: "Fuck the Sun" - Max 2024
[1:14:34] yooyoo1337: okay
[1:14:35] planooooooooooooooooooooo: CDR is hugfe
[1:14:36] smushez: down with the wrath spam
[1:14:36] Brotholomew13: is lunar beam just death and decay for bears?
[1:14:37] klanker: that's a lot of moons
[1:14:37] antipheonixna: u wrath wrath sunfire for th ebuff only then go lunar town in eclipse
[1:14:37] planooooooooooooooooooooo: huge
[1:14:37] JakeParkbench: Bear beam Pog
[1:14:38] yifors: that could be big
[1:14:42] ColdIceCreamMan: that's big
[1:14:43] Skizzurp: getting rid of the whole managing eclipse things is prob good
[1:14:43] Parduke: sooo.... goth hero class?
[1:14:44] CloudyHS: BEAM BEAR
[1:14:46] MrChaCho: fuck the sun, doesn't touch grass (treants). perfect wow gamer tree
[1:14:48] Blut103: lunar beam bear HOLY
[1:14:48] Pokects: do the praise the sun Paladin next for the “theme”
[1:14:50] LucasSterling_: its gonna be moon barrage
[1:14:53] Xelrathos: BIG BEAR BEAM
[1:14:54] Roseyoce: Moonkins are literally gonna be perma dropping moons on peoples heads
[1:14:55] thendj: ooh thrash giving you cdr on lunar beam with the arcane node
[1:14:56] adardrae: lazer bear
[1:14:57] braaahhh: beam 100% uptime
[1:14:58] JakeParkbench: This is the build I want to play right now
[1:14:59] Primit1ve: cdr for doing things is nice and engaging
[1:15:03] Starrk49: thrash is now arcane damage too
[1:15:03] Zozohnet: space bear seems sick
[1:15:04] Keppie__: Moonfire spam for beams
[1:15:08] smushez: cool in theme. power TBD
[1:15:09] REDSUNDERGROUND: LASER BEAR
[1:15:09] Zaisx: moonkins are just dropping moons and moon beams
[1:15:10] Cruel_Paul: @maximum extremely sick tree for Balance... what a great idea
[1:15:14] klappe92: FTS Bear
[1:15:17] Lrauq: putting the moon in moonkin
[1:15:22] storm7elemental: it's just passive, no brain, makes the spec even easier but really cool theme imo
[1:15:22] Diinklebeeerg: it sounds real good for M+ Boomie
[1:15:28] Khorvan: I just hope it's tuned better than the other one so I never have to play trees
[1:15:29] yungnuty: im late what trees did he already talk about
[1:15:29] Brotholomew13: Does lunar beam follow you? Or is it ground aoe?
[1:15:32] ColdIceCreamMan: more of the same. probably plays a little faster but doesn't really change things.
[1:15:32] Fraxien: i like this one a lot more than the other one
[1:15:33] antipheonixna: its similar build to current but u would have fury and moon and a lot more burst it seems which is nice
[1:15:37] LucasSterling_: cdr make downtime very bad for dps
[1:15:39] DukeRollo_: nope
[1:15:41] imjp21: chat wait till he gets to rogue
[1:15:57] Parkreiner: this one is a stinker
[1:15:58] gloop1: the trickster rotation is gonna be so disgusting
[1:15:59] dreadPack: Imagine tree hero talent becomes mushroom hero talent
[1:15:59] Nickystr1x: wildstalker is so jb-coded
[1:16:00] ctg_dreamz: Chat did they change how you sub with prime? not seeing it anymore
[1:16:03] BickenBone: go to rogue it’ll be 2/3
[1:16:05] Jazzarus_: this is the worst of the 8
[1:16:05] wildcherrybepsi: this one seems like a banger
[1:16:10] burne114: This one is just full passive
[1:16:11] ColdIceCreamMan: this one is for catweaving
[1:16:13] headninja1ncharge: More BLEEDS!

[1:16:56] BickenBone: resto stonks?
[1:16:58] adardrae: pointless duration increase, feral has unlimited energy
[1:17:01] smushez: wow. yay for resto WG
[1:17:07] CloudyHS: oh thats cool
[1:17:07] Tigerklaue: resto big dps
[1:17:25] RowanWeir: primal wrath uncapped damage amp, kinda wild
[1:17:27] AriyWariy: @adardrae what? feral != rogue
[1:17:35] headninja1ncharge: Resto DPS is finna exit this Solar System

[1:17:38] TeamLiquid: Interested in purchasing a Mythic Amirdrassil, the Dreams Hope boost with Team Liquid? Head over to go.adv.gg/4XuCPI for pricing and to schedule a run! (Gold Only)
[1:17:51] Drenwow: @Maximum a bad thing with that talents is if a target with 10stacks of the debuff dies, and then a target at 90% hp has 1 stack, the stack doesnt go through and you lost 10 stacks
[1:18:10] Saahf: the vines also stack
[1:18:32] sundihyr: GIGA GAMBA
[1:18:35] Bollash: That definitely doesn't work like that
[1:18:38] Muffin_55: it’s literally fodder
[1:18:38] CloudyHS: @Maximum fodder to the flame moment
[1:18:39] ashelfal: i dont think the vines stack that buff
[1:18:40] MagicPants_99: last line on first node
[1:18:40] Bollash: only 1 10% ap
[1:18:42] Jazzarus_: This shows something that I was fearing, that you chose your hero spec based on the activity you're going to do and not your fantasy. At first glance, it seems KotG is better for raid and Wildstalker is better for m+. @Maximum
[1:18:43] Justeroo: the amp wont stack, but the bleeds will
[1:18:44] Cazacon109: casino cat build
[1:18:47] GingerPAC: I don't think that amp will stack
[1:18:56] skibibavax: This song goes hard

[1:19:20] Drenwow: no,
[1:19:20] Nickystr1x: stealth doesnt equal prowl
[1:19:22] 1_7_4: you can restealth
[1:19:24] OneEyeWay: you can enter prowl once
[1:19:25] 1_7_4: thats it
[1:19:31] LionButLeon: hm
[1:19:32] brandogzz: Very boring tree just passive % dmg thats super boring
[1:19:46] Jjmn12: ursols vertex KKona
[1:19:46] brandogzz: transforming and making your rotation should be the goal
[1:19:48] CloudyHS: Pog

[1:20:00] CloudyHS: FYRAKK GHOSTS
[1:20:04] Jesdawow: razsageth 2nd intermission adds
[1:20:13] lol_flux: you still would just mass root no?
[1:20:24] Zynathmung: aint no way thats a pvp node
[1:20:25] smushez: flower walk cool theme, nice speed boost
[1:20:29] headninja1ncharge: Nice offhealing
[1:21:05] klanker: 10%? HOLY
[1:21:21] MofuLord: regrowth on self seems nice for feral
[1:21:25] brokik1: regrowth increased healing on you is actually really really nice for feral
[1:21:26] expo513: oh yeah
[1:21:26] captainnetz: yes
[1:21:27] kiblinix: A lot of flat % in this tree kinda meh
[1:21:27] yungnuty: 100%
[1:21:28] BoozyWizard: Yes
[1:21:29] expo513: fat regirth
[1:21:29] lol_flux: is it just me or are these hero talents giga lame? like 10% healing received is nice and all but cmon..
[1:21:31] OneEyeWay: yeah
[1:21:34] Drenwow: yeah with the class talent
[1:21:35] headninja1ncharge: Free regrowths much better
[1:21:38] expo513: 30k increase rn
[1:21:38] Keppie__: Doubt
[1:21:41] zhrang911: Math DansGame
[1:21:43] Paandamonk1: dont feral get a free regrowth somtimes?
[1:21:44] Drenwow: you can get with today numbers like a 400k regro
[1:21:47] Drenwow: if it crits
[1:21:51] welling_2: depends if your playing with a hpal or not
[1:21:55] ninjaruler: yes regrowth on self for free every 3-4 seconds right now
[1:21:58] Unosojudio: You currently press regrowth a lot
[1:21:59] Diinklebeeerg: taht 10% just makes leech so much better for us then
[1:22:02] st1nkb0tt0m: @lol_flux it’s a little wack for feral but there’s another tree coming in have a lot of hope for
[1:22:06] antipheonixna: first one seems more raid second way more better in m+
[1:22:07] expo513: it's generated on combo points so you build pretty quick
[1:22:08] katana_rider: Not surprised these are feral talents. They really can't figure out the class identity
[1:22:12] Zzekar: regr are very weak rnow
[1:22:24] fellbear: did we do shaman already?
[1:22:33] Scoops__: 2nd ones good for m+ tho
[1:22:34] Parduke: choices good
[1:22:38] ModestMewtwo21: @Maximum Have they already said if you can freely swap hero talents at any time? or are we lookin at another covenants situation?
[1:22:39] Fraxien: @fellbear we did warrior and boomy so far
[1:22:44] Unosojudio: Protector of the pack synergies with it
[1:22:45] AriyWariy: thats bad, feral lacks of hp pull and dmg reduction, everything can oneshot you in raid or m+, feral need dmg red
[1:22:49] fellbear: @Fraxien Thanks
[1:22:50] spettetgaming: instant free regrowth after every finisher
[1:22:54] yifors: *gets 1shot*
[1:23:00] spivet: @fellbear shaman did not get a tree
[1:23:08] thegrt13: @fellbear pepelaugh thinking shaman trees are out
[1:23:13] dreadPack: Implant single target
[1:23:14] CloudyHS: its like unbound chaos for druids @Maximum
[1:23:14] Hillzor: @fellbear there is no shman :(
[1:23:21] planooooooooooooooooooooo: symbiosis??? Pog
[1:23:22] dreadPack: Twin sprouts aoe
[1:23:34] Tigerklaue: ok tree
[1:23:38] antipheonixna: this tree feel like ur not changing anything as feral, its just damage and damage % increases pretty boring
[1:23:41] expo513: druid of the claw
[1:23:42] CloudyHS: druid of the claw
[1:23:42] MofuLord: its very Bedge for feral imo
[1:23:45] AlvincatX: Druid of the Claw
[1:23:45] NightTrainTV: No damage reduction nodes which is what feral needs not healing, and no help for burst damage which is what feral needs.
[1:23:46] menzlo: Of the claw
[1:23:46] brokik1: its a no-thinking tree for feral
[1:23:48] spettetgaming: a bit boring, but seems ok
[1:23:49] yungnuty: i cant wait for all of these to be released and we get the tier list video
[1:23:50] OneEyeWay: feels more made for resto caw weaving
[1:23:56] stumie: imagine sharing a hero talent tree with a healer classic
[1:23:58] CloudyHS: meow
[1:23:59] SwankBanana: Its great for resto dps but feral is very passive
[1:24:03] natethenoob1234: meow
[1:24:05] natethenoob1234: ragey
[1:24:08] natethenoob1234: oops

[1:24:39] gwenmh: tree looks crazy for resto m+
[1:24:41] BoozyWizard: @cyapat1 Lets you be in meow meow form longer without having to manually heal. So its 6/10 for resto
[1:24:41] Justeroo: I cannot wait for him to read Scalecommander
[1:24:42] DanDanChair: It's fine
[1:24:42] KaisenSiru: devoGOOD
[1:24:42] Jesdawow: ok
[1:24:44] phdspc: has he done warlock yet?
[1:24:47] AriyWariy: feral need more passive dmg reduction
[1:24:47] RowanWeir: Little too many passive damage/healing nodes in it imo
[1:24:49] TheTestout: max, i need to go to bed, can we do ret prot pala?
[1:24:50] Nickystr1x: @Maximum ask jb if he thinks that wildstalker feral will make no healer keys easier next xpac
[1:24:50] JustRewind: @phdspc no
[1:24:51] hertz__i: no batchest?
[1:24:56] menzlo: All the cross role ones are gonna be mid
[1:24:57] wanik90: Same for resto, it seems great but so passive

[1:25:20] TotallyNotRaien: dont think he needs you to get mad
[1:25:21] Nf15617: Your brain will be fine, most hero trees are simple
[1:25:23] nanerpus_: only one way to find out
[1:25:23] Nickystr1x: yes, hes happy and he's a healer so we gotta take him down a peg
[1:25:28] yungnuty: the evoker one is banger imo
[1:25:33] CloudyHS: this goes hard
[1:25:34] Warptime: The Lizzy General
[1:25:34] Shirey12: @Maximum can you call JPC when you review rogue?

[1:25:48] guynormally: dev is so fun
[1:25:50] phdspc: dev is a lot of fun
[1:25:51] Line_0: this tree is great

[1:26:26] craftypawn: Upheavla
[1:26:37] gigaerick: it does damage split among targets in the area
[1:26:47] headninja1ncharge: Mass Disintegrate is going to SLAP

[1:27:47] yifors: even spriests?
[1:27:47] PrimeTimeRime: MASS DISINTIGRATE
[1:27:48] Line_0: dev will be pumping
[1:27:48] gigaerick: @Maximum i'm curious how eruption will work, considering it splits damage between targets already
[1:27:49] NooboniousPrime: but it's 3 target cleave, not 3 target spread?
[1:27:49] Justeroo: ohhhhh he's gonna nut at the end
[1:27:51] BoozyWizard: Tri beam dev
[1:27:52] sworduserr: wait until rogue one HAHA

[1:28:15] Line_0: more pog
[1:28:21] Diinklebeeerg: prio target blast
[1:28:25] JamesTiedye: All the numbers are susceptible to balance change I assume
[1:28:27] Parduke: nat Aoe
[1:28:28] Basic_3: Just ICD?
[1:28:36] MrGharr: prob ICD
[1:28:41] RowanWeir: if it's got a good visual i think it'll be fun to look at at least, nice theme
[1:28:43] brunbanan: tab target disnegrate?
[1:28:43] GooseComics: Maybe ICD yeah
[1:28:44] Line_0: you do a ton of mass dinsintegrate
[1:28:45] Arisolo: @Maximum mostl ikely it'll be RPPM and capped atl ike 2 or something regardless of actual inputs
[1:28:47] headninja1ncharge: Interesting thought
[1:28:53] mixj1: more dmg on single target
[1:28:53] Justeroo: I'm feeling that too. Has raid buff potential
[1:28:55] panta_xdd: Quadratic scalling
[1:28:59] Tigerklaue: 25 evoker raid
[1:28:59] Parduke: mark multi target?
[1:28:59] Diinklebeeerg: 4 dev evokers instead of augs now
[1:29:00] Paandamonk1: 15 evokers, all bombardments
[1:29:01] Basic_3: @brunbanan It only comes off the already cleaving Mass Disin
[1:29:03] Ashille: it will be bugged and proc on pet hit lma
[1:29:05] auby6: YAY MORE BUFF WAAHOO
[1:29:06] JustRewind: I really like the approach they took here for fitting in both Aug and Dev thematics.
[1:29:08] marshmallow110: could be a party only buff no?
[1:29:12] Jesdawow: Cant wait for raids with 2 augs, 2 devs ok
[1:29:12] Weslicus: Arcane missiles go brrrrrr
[1:29:21] themadcatzzz: tf does quadratic scaling even mean
[1:29:22] Pyrrha_GG: or is just has a limited about of triggers, like judgement of light
[1:29:23] Fishbulb07: lord have mercy i'm bout to bombard
[1:29:31] malnourish_: prob piss dmg
[1:29:36] purpformance: its poop
[1:29:42] purpformance: not a good talent
[1:29:43] headninja1ncharge: I like the theme so far
[1:29:48] purpformance: for dev
[1:29:53] Parduke: mm time to make curry l8r nerds
[1:30:01] mixj1: db i not good
[1:30:04] Arisolo: @Maximum most likely bombardment will be RPPM and capped atl ike 2 or something regardless of actual inputs. the "your group triggers it." is just flavour
[1:30:06] planooooooooooooooooooooo: giving your assa rogues DM for every smolderon amp
[1:30:11] Line_0: reads as all bombardements
[1:30:13] Nickystr1x: deep breath is less whatever when you read forward lol
[1:30:17] beels189: Deep breath ain't nothing anymore Kappa
[1:30:19] Cutencuddly73: this tree is breath related
[1:30:19] Fraxien: deep breath such a long cast time for meh damage
[1:30:23] phdspc: It doesn't need to be improved for dev. just wait
[1:30:26] thendj: deep breath does big dam
[1:30:32] JustRewind: Deep Breath core theme in rest of tree
[1:30:36] Kooznik: just wait
[1:30:36] M3xM: bombardment is a really funny word
[1:30:40] Justeroo: would be cool that bombardments gave % stacking damage per one that goes off to your next deep breath
[1:30:43] phdspc: just wait
[1:30:44] Justeroo: so you can hold it for a HUGE nuke
[1:30:46] Yimbus737: read further

[1:31:07] Pyrrha_GG: @themadcatzzz means that your damage scales with targets exponentially instead of linerally
[1:31:07] mixj1: if we get it on d rage dev would be insane
[1:31:09] cyapat1: KEKW CHAT CLASSIC
[1:31:09] Zatador: It's farfetched, but have 10 evokers; all using bombardment and they keep triggering eachothers bombardment. Stuff will be destroyed
[1:31:09] purpformance: clapped

[2:05:37] BobDaBilda: Hammerdin from D3, but in WoW?
[2:05:37] Boreall: Ret*
[2:05:40] Dberjerak823: So many hammers they need to rename to Carpenter paladin
[2:05:41] Nf15617: all the problems really are nails
[2:05:46] sealteamsesh: Aint nobody going lightsmith KEKW
[2:05:49] atlascore88: Que the hammer bro from mario mogs
[2:05:51] JediDude13: Hammer of light replaced Wake. so you can't wake into Hammer.
[2:06:02] themadcatzzz: divine toll baseline?
[2:06:08] valk113: a free 10% shield of vengence every 30 seconds!?!?! someone slap me this is unreal
[2:06:11] Bollash: The up right one is a passive 5% dr
[2:06:28] RowanWeir: its do you want divine toll i guess
[2:06:31] BabyDunn: toll-less build?
[2:06:36] planooooooooooooooooooooo: is divine toll baseline?
[2:06:40] gloop1: in pvp you'll take burst
[2:06:41] Lyonidus: @valk113 that's kind of really bad, only about 3-4% of your hp
[2:06:42] ArcaneSyntax: The DT talent seems pretty placeholdery
[2:06:44] Evan_Ralston: casual play preference?
[2:06:46] daggerd314: @Maximum ret doesn't have toll?
[2:06:46] Keionys_: Wake is 30 sec DT is 60 sec

[2:06:51] iAruban: for whom the bell tolls soudns cooler so im taking that
[2:06:55] MissingLobe: Yeah
[2:06:58] lumaday: one of the best buttons in game
[2:07:02] Baskkov: @daggerd314 where you born yesterday? :D
[2:07:03] Jesdawow: @JediDude13 for 12s AFTER you cast wake, then it goes back to wake
[2:07:06] MissingLobe: esp with this tier
[2:07:16] UnheardGrace: it's for the people who are angry enough at shadowlands lore to refuse to use any former covenant abilties
[2:07:18] DeyrFe_: divine toll is goated
[2:07:20] daggerd314: @Baskkov apparently I thought it was only prot

[2:08:05] Muspel: Second one sounds bursty with divine toll
[2:08:07] pleezenthnku: second one synergy with for who the bell tolls
[2:08:08] RowanWeir: toll would give CRAZY stacks on the second

[2:08:53] gloop1: pressing distract and feint for dps is gonna be so fun
[2:08:54] Nickystr1x: the rogue one is good other than the one massive fatal flaw with it
[2:08:54] storm7elemental: as an outlaw rogue, the other one better not suck...
[2:08:54] antipheonixna: left side seems to make divine toll in aoe builds better for bosses, or lets u go single target build judgement spam

[2:09:00] VehxD: warlock is cool weird that destro makes tons of demons tho

[2:10:00] zerossussy: it is lame as fuck and everyone in rogue discord is going banana's about it
[2:10:01] Tuulz_: feint in rotation sounds like ARMS warrior using ignore pain as an offensive spell
[2:10:02] Basic_3: The defensive creep in this tree is insane
[2:10:04] Ishamyyl: on-theme with trickster i guess
[2:10:04] storm7elemental: i don't want to push feint to do damage, it's my dr

[2:15:43] Nox1o: keep the 1hr tricks, scrap the rest
[2:15:45] BigTrout3: i'm pissed slice and dice is fucking staying. the unpruning in shadowlands was a mistake
[2:15:45] edangus23: bout to do the same thing to monks too i bet
[2:15:47] dubbyatt: realz will handle it
[2:15:49] auby6: clunky
[2:15:51] Chilzoth: as a destro/demo player its yawn
[2:15:56] chadderz7: trickster forsenTF
[2:15:57] Coriollis: I hope at least they make 1 column for m+ , 1 for raid , 1 for pvp
[2:15:58] Diinklebeeerg: it synergizes by being all bad xdd
[2:16:05] kamikazekid1213: Just better pray the assassination links are god
[2:16:05] BbreakGaming: yes let the rogues suffer KEKW
[2:16:07] BickenBone: just hit tricks 4head
[2:16:08] Epiclawlzable: I just don't want feint to be a dps cooldown
[2:16:10] polesreport: the one with no synergy with the others is the best lol
[2:16:15] planooooooooooooooooooooo: this is blizzard being a classic trickster, very thematic PepeLaugh
[2:16:17] MrGharr: nothing can be worse than Oracle
[2:16:17] Nf15617: 3 tress that need redone so far
[2:16:19] daggerd314: @BigTrout3 slice has been a rogue thing for like 90% of the classes existence prob get over it or reroll
[2:16:20] DigoCapiroto: It's tricking you thinking its bad
[2:16:22] Lirnril: it's cool that they couldnt come up with a more exciting sounding theme than "tricky guy"
[2:16:31] benzou2: Offer constructive criticism, dont be weird
[2:16:34] LCS01: @Maximum blizzard released a note about Lock tree, read it after you read the tree
[2:16:34] Jesdawow: no dobby WeirdDude
[2:16:37] storm7elemental: don't crap on them, they took a shot, it's bad, that's okay, go again
[2:16:40] Masterbahner: Burn it all
[2:16:42] RowanWeir: honestly only 3 needing major reworks so far is kinda surprising
[2:16:44] waelrick: surely wow players wont be toxic to devs Clueless
[2:16:46] planooooooooooooooooooooo: maximumBeakless
[2:16:49] Slagggy: trickster is booty, its diablist time! which is much cooler anyway
[2:16:50] BickenBone: the “trickster” part is that there is actually a second tree that is the true tree
[2:16:51] JustRewind: @Maximum  Diabolist had an important clarification in the feedback thread. The demons summoned are cyclical. Overlord -> Mother of Chaos -> Pit Lord -> Repeat.

[2:16:52] imanyone: realz was in the rogue disc talking, he knows how we’re feeling
[2:16:57] Rafix1301: lets go lock
[2:16:57] MrGharr: Diablock
[2:17:04] tankeern: it worries me that they created that for rogue in the first place??? :)
[2:17:06] wasp234: Warlock time giga
[2:17:08] Frozentoes_: warlock fucks hard
[2:17:13] Ragemasta1: Warlock one is good
[2:17:14] Scoop262: super mega chad warlock
[2:17:17] kamikazekid1213: Warlock banger
[2:17:17] Octto_: warlock is so fucking sick
[2:17:18] Cloudemon: youre about to read the best one
[2:17:18] JustRewind: Diabolist had an important clarification in the feedback thread. The demons summoned are cyclical. Overlord -> Mother of Chaos -> Pit Lord -> Repeat.
[2:17:19] Chilzoth: its meh
[2:17:20] Cazacon109: lock imo is the biggest banger too
[2:17:24] relimee0: WARLOCK Pog
[2:17:25] BickenBone: warlock slaps hard
[2:17:25] CloudyHS: GOES SO HARD
[2:17:25] relimee0: WARLOCK Pog 󠀀
[2:17:27] BigTrout3: @daggerd314 WeirdDude
[2:17:28] Coriollis: if they dont go left column is good for everything , I will be happy
[2:17:32] Diinklebeeerg: these are also the easier ones to fit with the themes no?? i feel  like the rest are a little tricky
[2:17:34] LionButLeon: WideTHD
[2:17:35] cheados: if they just dont attach it to feint i think its fine?
[2:17:39] Nf15617: warlock tree is odd
[2:17:42] CloudyHS: Pog
[2:17:46] planooooooooooooooooooooo: wtf HUGE
[2:17:48] RowanWeir: they get summoned in order
[2:17:48] CloudyHS: BANGER
[2:17:49] inklein_: Cool idea
[2:17:52] LCS01: @Maximum blizzard released a note about Lock tree, read it after you read the tree 󠀀
[2:17:52] VehxD: having tons of demons for destro makes it feel like that OG cutscene in vanilla with the undead warlock but it feels weird in retail
[2:17:52] Scoop262: its not RNG either
[2:17:54] moonxviii: THAT SOUNDS EPIC
[2:17:55] Cazacon109: they better make the pit lord big this time, please
[2:17:56] numnumss: @max they go in that order every time!
[2:17:57] Ghoulfos: ya lock looking fun
[2:18:00] malavander: works just like Doom Brand
[2:18:01] ver_flashbang: This just sounds metal af
[2:18:05] wasp234: lock is goated
[2:18:05] gwenmh: YEP
[2:18:05] chadderz7: xdd
[2:18:06] Xileonn: They come out in order not random even
[2:18:09] Billayy: lock is gonna be so good
[2:18:10] planooooooooooooooooooooo: "is it fun to press" Y/N
[2:18:14] DunzoCD: the rng might suck but looks fun
[2:18:15] bobtari: how big is the pit lord gonna be
[2:18:17] Isonmat: it gets better FeelsGoodMan
[2:18:18] JustRewind: Diabolist had an important clarification in the feedback thread. The demons summoned are cyclical. Overlord -> Mother of Chaos -> Pit Lord -> Repeat. 󠀀
[2:18:18] Ragemasta1: This one fuckin SLAPS
[2:18:24] BigTrout3: imo this tree is great for demo, not as good as destro
[2:18:24] Jesdawow: @DunzoCD theres no RNG
[2:18:25] LionButLeon: cloven Pog
[2:18:25] thegrt13: yea. the first thing needs to be goated and then the rest cant be very minor and its still sick
[2:18:25] wasp234: @DunzoCD not rng
[2:18:30] Ragemasta1: There isn't RNG btw, it goes in a cycle
[2:18:32] brunbanan: rng?
[2:18:32] Mr_Mittons: NOTED cloved
[2:18:33] Parkreiner: NOTED
[2:18:33] TheItalianStallion321: I CLOVEN THE SHIT OUT OF M+

[2:18:52] Snackra: 12?
[2:18:52] Lindorn_: blound
[2:18:53] deanw0w69: 12 = 20 ok
[2:18:54] SirScizor2020: 12?
[2:18:57] Ravaldknight: HUGE
[2:18:58] thiccsushi: Dentge
[2:18:58] Nickystr1x: clove enemy souls in my spiced apple cider
[2:19:02] Chilzoth: best choice node
[2:19:02] Razdruid: thats huge
[2:19:02] wasp234: 12 Dentge
[2:19:04] meken: HOLY
[2:19:06] tribin01: Why did Max hit us with that language lore lmfao
[2:19:07] LionButLeon: 12 xdd
[2:19:09] Jjmn12: Soul-Etched Circles is so cozy
[2:19:09] gloop1: big quality of life
[2:19:11] CloudyHS: SOULBORN
[2:19:12] PurpleKami: tindral wouldve been so much better with that teleport node
[2:19:20] Cazacon109: @tribin01 to show he's a wise learned man
[2:19:23] Basic_3: PvP garbage
[2:19:23] Athanasius296: pvp
[2:19:24] Ravaldknight: pvp only
[2:19:26] TheSHAYdynasty: soulburnoud
[2:19:26] Darkrunes: pvp talent
[2:19:27] Muspel: 25s AoE stop
[2:19:28] Razdruid: its super niche
[2:19:28] Mr_Mittons: terror is hard pvp
[2:19:28] rpgonlyforme: we don't
[2:19:29] storm7elemental: pvp?
[2:19:29] LuciFeariUm: you never take howl outside of pvp
[2:19:29] Chilzoth: niche
[2:19:31] rpgonlyforme: we take coil
[2:19:35] LuciFeariUm: because its mortal coil or howl
[2:19:43] Muspel: Only 5 enemies though
[2:19:43] Jjmn12: razageth spell
[2:19:45] Mazkon: stop but it moves the mobs so its eh
[2:19:45] mayfire15: pvp most take coil too
[2:19:51] thunder993: Thd time xdd
[2:19:54] JustRewind: Second option is ass, not interesting node, Demonic Circle is default choice
[2:19:56] Xileonn: if Howl would heal you maybe you take it
[2:19:58] relimee0: the heal from coil too
[2:19:59] DrQuackzalver: hello yes I want to remove my only sustain please
[2:20:00] relimee0: is super good
[2:20:03] Camelbak21: And makes them stand still...
[2:20:03] yifors: thats a priest fear
[2:20:10] Muspel: Probably a target cap for PvP
[2:20:10] Camelbak21: Who wants mobs running all over the place
[2:20:11] Desorient123: to make it bad
[2:20:12] VehxD: mass pvp idk
[2:20:13] herso_: only played howl on raz this expantion
[2:20:13] sealteamsesh: just outdated design
[2:20:15] Keppie__: Fears used to have that
[2:20:16] malacathwow: If Howl of Terror was ranged and worked with the Horrify talent it would be rly good.
[2:20:17] HekticFox: legacy, no real reason
[2:20:21] Aro725: same with warrior, capped for no reason
[2:20:21] kamikazekid1213: You will never take it over mc being an extra healthstone
[2:20:23] Lenietwitch: fuck pvppppppppppp
[2:20:23] wasp234: I mean just target cap it for pvp then
[2:20:24] Keppie__: old thing dosent makes sense anymore
[2:20:24] herso_: aoe interupt
[2:20:27] gloop1: probably cause theres too many other aoe fears
[2:20:30] Lindorn_: only 5 guys get scared
[2:20:30] JustRewind: Heal from coil is too good as well, never taking the other option
[2:20:34] Ravaldknight: placeholder node
[2:20:48] planooooooooooooooooooooo: oh my god
[2:20:49] Basic_3: They really need to clarify if that affects Nether Portal
[2:20:50] Ravaldknight: massive for chaos bolts
[2:20:52] Dagnet: same reason psychic scream is 5 targets: fuck you thats why
[2:21:01] bigmeanbeefy: Weakaura that shit!
[2:21:04] kingtoke1991: big for chaos bolts
[2:21:05] moistmuffin007: Like your chaos bolt
[2:21:06] kingtoke1991: like huge
[2:21:16] moistmuffin007: big ole bolts
[2:21:23] Basic_3: That second node seems like 5x better than the first choice
[2:21:25] niwaar: basically you will want to hold shards and then burst through them but not spend your last shard
[2:21:27] JustRewind: Uninteresting, Infernal Machine just is way better
[2:21:32] Mr_Mittons: middle path is big destro
[2:21:33] Zoulis: what if the first one stacks?
[2:21:37] Nyraell: can you have multiple rituals running from tyrant/portal/infernal?
[2:21:39] malacathwow: @Maximum  Second one is a lot stronger than first one.
[2:21:45] storm7elemental: it'll happen more often off cd
[2:21:46] Deatheran: no
[2:21:46] Line_0: only one presumably
[2:21:48] Basic_3: It's a buff on you I think
[2:21:54] Athanasius296: that would be way too good
[2:21:59] Deatheran: by its wording probably not
[2:22:00] brokik1: would be really weird if you could have multiple running
[2:22:01] Athanasius296: you would have an army of pitlords
[2:22:02] Line_0: it looks like the demo tier, which is only one
[2:22:02] TheeDucksays: that’d be sick
[2:22:05] Chilzoth: probably not, its probably going to just lower that duration by 3 sec
[2:22:05] Razdruid: I hope they aren't intending us to play fucking NP again
[2:22:11] Razdruid: that was legit dogshit playstyle
[2:22:13] Parkreiner: the wording seems to indicate it's just one ritual at a time
[2:22:13] niji: i think it's like current demo tier
[2:22:14] Monsters27: they posted about how ritual works
[2:22:16] jivan92: cozy musik max i like it
[2:22:19] Sover31gn: Lowering duration would be ass if you drop it by getting a new one
[2:22:25] BratBranko: felguard is big
[2:22:27] Basic_3: That lines Felguard up with Tyrant
[2:22:30] Billayy: Yes, it's a cycle it resets and you cycle to the next demon
[2:22:31] BratBranko: lines up with tyrant
[2:22:31] Razdruid: HUGE
[2:22:31] luxury_chicken: that's huge
[2:22:33] MagicPants_99: that syncs it with tyrant
[2:22:35] Mr_Mittons: that lines up with tyrant
[2:22:36] Razdruid: that was our season 2 tier set
[2:22:36] DunzoCD: makes it line up with tyrant
[2:22:36] Ravaldknight: means that it will line up with 1:30 tyrant
[2:22:36] PurpleKami: lines up with tyrant, makes demo a 1.5 min class
[2:22:37] relimee0: @Maximum yea tyrant is 1.5 and gfg is 2min rn so it lines it up
[2:22:37] Deatheran: this one goes hard as fuck @Maximum it lines up FG with your other CDS its wild
[2:22:37] Chilzoth: it makes it on the same cd as tyrant
[2:22:38] Xileonn: CDR makes it line up with Tyrant
[2:22:39] rpgonlyforme: it lines up with tyrant
[2:22:39] aleafonthewind42m: It lines up GFG with Tyrant @Maximum
[2:22:40] JerryRages: Lines up felguard with tyrant every time
[2:22:43] LionButLeon: cata in st Bedge
[2:22:45] nine_out_of_ten: @Billayy Was about to say the same. FINALLY.
[2:22:47] hankypankieee: whole tree is kind of meh, feels like stuff we should have default
[2:22:48] Camelbak21: It's so scuffed tho
[2:22:49] rpgonlyforme: but that means 1.5min CD cycle which is awkward
[2:22:49] Basic_3: Cata is kind of hard to take in ST
[2:22:50] LuciFeariUm: the cata one is kinda Deadge
[2:22:53] niwaar: my question is more along the lines, of is the demon summoned random or is there a way to force a specific one, because having an Overlord or Pit Lord seems situationally better
[2:23:00] wasp234: Pog
[2:23:01] Chilzoth: 2 80% chaos bolts is meh
[2:23:02] Ghoulfos: free bolts is chill gonna cast cata anyway
[2:23:04] Basic_3: @niwaar It's cyclical
[2:23:07] Line_0: top
[2:23:08] JustRewind: One of the demons
[2:23:08] Chilzoth: one of the demons
[2:23:10] stumie: 1st node rng
[2:23:11] Ravaldknight: @niwaar it cycles through them, blizzard clarified this
[2:23:12] LuciFeariUm: @niwaar it rotates between the 3. its cyclical
[2:23:13] goodmonsin: The demons summon in order
[2:23:15] Wildfire_Gaming: rng peepoAwesome
[2:23:17] Basic_3: The demons off the first node are summoned in a cycle, in order.
[2:23:19] numnumss: the 3 summons are always in that order
[2:23:20] relimee0: The demons summon in order
[2:23:22] billabong212: They cycle
[2:23:23] Drenwow: the summons cycle in that order
[2:23:24] Faraday5001: the demons cycle in an order
[2:23:26] PurpleKami: that sounds so sick to me
[2:23:27] zeitgeiz: it cycles through so you know what you are gonna summon next
[2:23:28] billabong212: The demons Cycle
[2:23:29] stumie: its 1.5 seconds its just 1 cast
[2:23:30] jjwallababy: its 1.5 seconds lol
[2:23:30] goodmonsin: overlord, mother, pit
[2:23:31] JustRewind: The demons are cyclical. Overlord -> Mother -> Pitlord -> Repeat.
[2:23:32] Razdruid: dogshit
[2:23:32] surfazing_: Main ability is not rng, its in order as written btw
[2:23:33] Rattboy22: They made a post saying the demons that spawn are a cycle order
[2:23:36] heyitsdeli: i hope mother of chaos is one of the fat demons
[2:23:38] Line_0: i dont think it neccesarily locks you into it, but thats just me
[2:23:39] SwankBanana: 1.5 sec channel though
[2:23:41] Muspel: It basically makes your next filler way stronger
[2:23:41] Scoop262: super short channel that casts 4 of your fillers, its like warlock convoke
[2:23:43] PurpleKami: 1.5 seconds to get 4 soul shards is insane
[2:23:44] Ravaldknight: it also depends on whether these shadow bolts give you shards
[2:23:45] Xileonn: 1.5 sec is the base shaowbolt castime
[2:23:48] hotdogmartyr: seems kinda cool
[2:23:49] BigTrout3: ye
[2:23:49] BratBranko: it is 4 fillers tho
[2:23:50] panacer: 4 shadowbolts in 1 gcd is kinda nuts
[2:23:56] goodmonsin: so each demon makes each cycle a little dif
[2:23:56] Basic_3: Technically channels are better because if you interrupt them you get partial value I guess?
[2:23:56] Jjmn12: that would be sick
[2:23:57] wasp234: 6 shadow bolts in 1.5 sec damage wise
[2:23:59] brokik1: destro locks know how to stand still itll be fine
[2:24:00] JustRewind: YES PLEASE LET US MOVEEEE
[2:24:02] Line_0: that would be great
[2:24:06] PurpleKami: shadow bolt is a filler that trucks too
[2:24:07] JustRewind: And 4 shards
[2:24:08] stumie: 4 fillers at 150% dmg in 1 gcd is NUTS
[2:24:09] Mister__Mango: Is this 4 times 150%? or is this 4 times that add up to 150%?
[2:24:11] yifors: so mind flay: insanity
[2:24:12] malvy1: the fact that they need to clarify that, said alot about their competence
[2:24:16] obadimir: how does it interact with shards generation
[2:24:19] Basic_3: This node is kinda fake
[2:24:21] LionButLeon: ok
[2:24:21] SwankBanana: Nah I want KJ cunning back also
[2:24:31] PurpleKami: warlock is already immortal during unending resolve
[2:24:33] Diinklebeeerg: i wonder if its locked at 1.5 seconds or if haste has an effect on it
[2:24:38] Basic_3: During your wall where you can't die you extra can't die. OK
[2:24:46] thesunnyside: 10% shield more or less
[2:24:47] LuciFeariUm: Destro does
[2:24:49] niwaar: @Line_0 its cyclical, but is there a skill point in that cycle, as in its an overlord if the ritual goes full duration, and mother is half ritual and pit lord is less than half... would mean the ability would have a real skill cap, but nothing hugely problematic to button masher easy mode players
[2:24:51] Oracle_WoW: IS there a node that says "pets no longer trigger combat in any situation ever." ? that would be sick
[2:24:52] JustRewind: Core mechanic for tree is banger, choice nodes suck
[2:24:54] bayazijr: exactly
[2:24:54] LuciFeariUm: I have to press my defensives just to cast my spells
[2:24:56] Taytor: gard
[2:24:58] DrQuackzalver: yes, sometimes I have to move out of the fire :(
[2:24:58] stumie: THE DESTRO PART OF THIS NODE IS SO BAD
[2:25:00] Chilzoth: it just heals you after you use it to take a hit, meh
[2:25:05] Coriollis: maybe some classes will do crazy burst in pvp who knows
[2:25:10] wasp234: That doesnt mean you have to havoc st right?
[2:25:21] stumie: @wasp234 thats exactly what it means peepoSad
[2:25:24] LuciFeariUm: @niwaar no lmao it just cycles between the 3
[2:25:26] Jjmn12: cloven
[2:25:26] Ravilian: left one
[2:25:26] Basic_3: @wasp234 It does
[2:25:27] wormsauce: top left one
[2:25:27] goodmonsin: left front
[2:25:28] JustRewind: Overlord is the left
[2:25:28] Line_0: @niwaar wrong person
[2:25:28] comprises_: top left
[2:25:28] Basic_3: Left side
[2:25:29] G1ku: the left one
[2:25:29] Chilzoth: left tree
[2:25:30] klanker: top left
[2:25:30] Muspel: top left
[2:25:30] pleezenthnku: top left
[2:25:30] Tactyks: left node
[2:25:30] JerryRages: You summoner Overlord first, then mother of chaos, then overlord
[2:25:30] Ragemasta1: Top Left
[2:25:31] kren898: Left side
[2:25:31] treesuum: first one on the left
[2:25:31] aleafonthewind42m: The top lef
[2:25:31] inklein_: first node on the left
[2:25:32] niwaar: its the Cloven hooves one
[2:25:32] klappe92: left side
[2:25:32] Rafix1301: the left one
[2:25:33] Raggu2: netherportal also summons a pit lord iirc.
[2:25:33] Warador117: first on the left
[2:25:33] kuromebro: You get 8 more supply
[2:25:36] nairb1: oh sweet baby jesus
[2:25:38] LionButLeon: cloven Pog
[2:25:45] wasp234: Cringe ST havoc moment peepoSad
[2:25:45] omgwatlol: lock getting ready for new tank spec in 10.0.5
[2:25:46] SjayGG: CloverLord
[2:25:49] bayazijr: Blizzard should really use these hero talents as a way to balance defensiveness. give shamans and druids powerful defense nodes and tanky classes get weak defense nodes basically
[2:25:50] JustRewind: So 10% damage, demonfire barrage, demon meteor
[2:25:51] Ravaldknight: it combines chaos bolt and hand of guldan
[2:25:58] MissingLobe: IMPact
[2:25:58] BigTrout3: i wonder if demo locks get value from summoning a pit lord with Nether Portal
[2:25:59] VehxD: destro with more pets is weird tbh especially with ruination. why do destro just get a hand of guldan
[2:26:01] Basic_3: Wild Imps as Destro, lol
[2:26:02] JakeParkbench: sounds kinda based
[2:26:02] Empirics_: Meh
[2:26:06] benzou2: sounds badass
[2:26:07] logicaltty: i mean the RP sounds sick as fuck
[2:26:08] niwaar: the tree feels fun, but its power dependent
[2:26:09] PurpleKami: the flavor is sick
[2:26:09] LiviingTrash: demon infested meter sounds sick
[2:26:10] DrQuackzalver: totally depends on how SICK it looks
[2:26:10] Lindorn_: demonado
[2:26:12] MainCharacter_: Uncapped damage?
[2:26:15] hotdogmartyr: i like it
[2:26:16] Xileonn: Ruination = Chaosbolt + Hand in one
[2:26:16] Dberjerak823: Demon infested meteor Pog
[2:26:17] gloop1: gonna be fun
[2:26:17] stumie: its probably a super hand of guldan with 100% crit chance like a chaos bolt
[2:26:21] Athanasius296: tfw demon infested means 3 imps
[2:26:22] Mr_Mittons: wild imps on destro tho idk
[2:26:23] Messi779: this is probably why they capped the imp scaling in tyrant
[2:26:25] logain_13: That's basically what HoG already is, so it probably hits hard
[2:26:25] storm7elemental: love the theme, some of the side nodes could be adjusted but it's cool
[2:26:26] maleific: Thematic as fuck
[2:26:26] Diinklebeeerg: warlock full moon poggers
[2:26:28] ZaderRaider: The demons get cycled, blizzard had a blue post
[2:26:32] Basic_3: Destro cycles through the demons much slower than Demo I think
[2:26:32] Snackra: that just sounds like a 3 shard hand of guldan
[2:26:33] EthnicSmoke: feels like a demo tree more than a destro tree :/
[2:26:34] torchedwood: seems like big dam and animation mostly, and imps to not screw with demo rotation
[2:26:35] niwaar: hopefully they do well with the demon design and they arent just normal
[2:26:37] Chilzoth: itll probably look like the infernal summon/blasphemy
[2:26:37] herso_: some reowrk needed cause pitlord and tyrant is currently dead
[2:26:37] stumie: warlocks always get the cool shit Madge
[2:26:38] Deatheran: yea LOL warlock full moon LETSGO
[2:26:39] Muspel: I think the idea of a buff that you want to shorten by spending resources is cool
[2:26:40] wasp234: Big Colossus
[2:26:44] Jjmn12: @Athanasius296 DEMON INFESTED METEOR (it's just hand of gul'dan)
[2:26:47] bertramacles: hero talent tier list
[2:26:47] mathfaver: here we go...
[2:26:53] obadimir: it feel weird gameplay wise but looks cool as hell
[2:26:58] niwaar: the most fun demon summons are still the random "named" demon
[2:27:00] ikeawizard: @EthnicSmoke because its the demo mainly tree? destro has hellcaller
[2:27:01] Basic_3: Tyrant is super white-listed now. No interaction with Hero tree
[2:27:02] Camelbak21: If you use the last node there to make it 1 min
[2:27:03] Camelbak21: it scuffs it
[2:27:11] CloudyHS: @Maximum the fact that most of these trees are sick, and theyve shown they will rework the dogshit ones, makes me super hyped for hero talents
[2:27:13] Basic_3: There won't be any interaction with the Pit Lord
[2:27:16] stumie: I don't think those demons are effected by tyrnat
[2:27:16] Ravaldknight: they dont interact
[2:27:19] malacathwow: Tyrant don't extend all demons anymore
[2:27:20] fallb4me: its just 3 imps idk
[2:27:20] stelfbronco: no
[2:27:23] benzou2: Pitlord just does damage and leaves
[2:27:23] DrQuackzalver: don't think it would interact
[2:27:24] spivet: tyrant got changed to only effect a few demons, it won't interact
[2:27:25] torchedwood: nag, it’s a whitelist now.
[2:27:26] wasp234: 3 imps is w/e
[2:27:29] Messi779: nah you already cap imps with just the normal tyrant ramp
[2:27:33] Oracle_WoW: wtf is this music?
[2:27:33] Nf15617: you would want overfiend for damage amp
[2:27:35] Xileonn: Tyrant is whitelisted it does nothing with other than imps and FG basically
[2:27:37] RiverWell: does ruination work with havoc?
[2:27:40] Coriollis: destro kinda sacks the demons for more power doesn't it ?
[2:27:42] storm7elemental: rogue is the only poopoo tree, honestly impressive
[2:27:43] stelfbronco: you do tyrant when you do your do felgaurd and dogs
[2:27:44] Cazacon109: the coolness of the tree depends on how big the demons are
[2:27:44] Basic_3: Does the second middle node interact with Nether Portal though?
[2:27:46] FrenzyBurn: Chaos is good for chaos incarnate for destro right?
[2:27:53] BratBranko: hand summons 3  imps anyway so this doesnt change anything
[2:28:00] Deatheran: demo already caps imps atm so not realy a factor
[2:28:00] stumie: that tree is gonna be so sexy
[2:28:08] thiccsushi: Trickster PepeLaugh
[2:28:13] RaderTader: pogging
[2:28:15] JustRewind: Main concern is demo spends way more shards than destro, but that seems fixable
[2:28:17] Entenstein_: today made me a lot more hopeful for shaman trees
[2:28:19] niwaar: you are going to functionally want Overlord during your tyrant, but it wouldnt be horrible if your rotation cycled into one of the other
[2:28:19] gloop1: I've got major concerns around balancing this stuff
[2:28:21] WValhe: Colossus looks so dog vs all these kekw
[2:28:21] planooooooooooooooooooooo: i refuse to believe the trickster tree is real, it's just another trick
[2:28:21] herso_: pitlord was the capstone for when we played with gate
[2:28:24] LazerBeemz: are they reworking dark ranger…?
[2:28:24] 1_blase: not according to bellular, he think the the war within is dead
[2:28:25] ArcaneSyntax: Even the SoD changes were sick today
[2:28:27] merzicdh: i wish we could see monk talents
[2:28:29] stumie: trickster is definitely a tree SUSSY
[2:28:29] luriosbael: @BratBranko but hand can be cast with 1 SS so you prolly still get the 3 imps with 1 ss with ruination
[2:28:33] Keionys_: Which ones need the rework the fastest at this point? (Excluding oracle)
[2:28:36] Mr_Mittons: @1_blase KEKW
[2:28:36] Chilzoth: the wording on the initial talent is weird. "it unleashes a devastating attack", now is it just damage, does it do something extra outside of damage and the talents we choose for it
[2:28:38] thatoneguynobodylikes352: They're saving the bad game design for monks
[2:28:39] Hoothor: Incoming Asmongold video: The War Within is giga dead
[2:28:42] JakeParkbench: Man do i look forward to BeamBear
[2:28:42] Nf15617: they need to speed up how fast they release these trees.
[2:28:44] maleific: Demo cycles so many shards. Stonks
[2:28:44] santalylth: these seem like a lot of bloat
[2:28:45] MrGharr: like size increase
[2:28:45] Baerhug_: lazer bear one is sick
[2:28:45] BarberBruh: @1_blase bellular will make any wow video about anything for any reason L takes only
[2:28:48] DanteDemonZ: thunder dragon colossus is a banned yugioh card right?
[2:28:50] leubinator: colossus is so insanely mid
[2:28:52] Zulimo: Elune gonna be default for Druid it feels like, just feels way more natural than trees
[2:28:55] Madcatmk02: 5 bangers 2 mid 1 dobby
[2:28:55] gfkoe: @DanteDemonZ yes
[2:28:57] mozerra: I want ma dk talents madcat
[2:28:58] Mister__Mango: Every time I see the new trees, I get a bit more hope for the Shaman one.
[2:28:58] xantaga: both of the warrior trees just have the problem of being uninspired @Maximum
[2:28:58] sw0ngs: warrior is so boringgggg
[2:29:00] CloudyHS: scalecommander fucks
[2:29:00] sealteamsesh: Can't wait to see monks Sadge

[2:29:12] pleezenthnku: shadow pan when?
[2:29:12] billabong212: Templar makes me wanna switch to pally
[2:29:13] stumie: @1_blase Bellular and Asmon WoW takes 🔇
[2:29:13] storm7elemental: good job blizz, they cooked
[2:29:13] potionirl: size needs to be at least 15%
[2:29:16] mmcdermid: i wish more had random flavour like size increases
[2:29:16] DanteDemonZ: @gfkoe I went to a regionals in that format, did not have fun at all
[2:29:18] hotdogmartyr: scalecommander owns
[2:29:18] daggerd314: @thatoneguynobodylikes352 so true LMAO
[2:29:18] Coriollis: we need dk talents for proper compare stuff
[2:29:20] BobAwesome: Warrior tree is boring? What else is new.
[2:29:25] BarberBruh: @stumie frfr
[2:29:25] Ragemasta1: @Madcatmk02 Which 2 are mid? XD
[2:29:25] hotdogmartyr: Dev making a comeback
[2:29:28] dango0n: balatro now? @maximum
[2:29:28] luxara_lol: whats the warlock tree? 😊
[2:29:30] Keppie__: Nah Colossus owns cant wait to be a big woman on my warrior

[2:29:55] Madcatmk02: @Ragemasta1 wildstalker and colossus
[2:29:56] antipheonixna: keep in mind we havent even had alpha and played with anything yet these are gonna rock
[2:29:58] FrenzyBurn: Scalecommander doe. Shit got me bricked up fr fr
[2:29:59] pleezenthnku: paladin had a real comeback today
[2:30:01] stelfbronco: @maximum you would think that hell caller would be a demo thing but it’s actually a destro and aff thing
[2:30:06] kamikazekid1213: Im just hoping tier sets wont  be based on which hero talents you will be taking
[2:30:08] DanteDemonZ: @gfkoe I played sunavalon at events last year, but apparently they got shot and the current format sucks, sadge
[2:30:12] pleezenthnku: frostfire
[2:30:15] pleezenthnku: banger
[2:30:16] storm7elemental: I like Elune's a lot
[2:30:19] Jjmn12: unless you hate the moon
[2:30:19] CloudyHS: dude the beam bear
[2:30:21] gfkoe: @DanteDemonZ yeah current format is tier 0 again
[2:30:22] Zulimo: I mean if the moons interact, then its banger
[2:30:23] 1_blase: herald of the sun>>>
[2:30:27] gfkoe: @gfkoe i dont play in person anymore
[2:30:28] leubinator: ppl that get hyped for colossus also get hyped for the color grey
[2:30:28] yuhhhhe: we cant see my guy
[2:30:33] ArcaneSyntax: Paladin became oops all bangers
[2:30:34] just_ie: @maximum how do you feel about them not Showing a single dh, monk or shaman tree, yet showing every pala tree and the boomie trees 4 times?
[2:30:40] achoooah: this game would be better with more 1 boss raids
[2:30:44] sloner: it has 3 s's
[2:30:47] DanteDemonZ: @gfkoe any time I hear that sentence I get nekroz ptsd, legit quit the game for 2 years cuz of that shit lmaooo
[2:30:50] niwaar: why are they bangers? are you seeing them with power or are you seeing them as fun and utilitarian?
[2:30:54] g0053_b3rr135: which monk tree will include the most toes?
[2:30:57] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge just my luck
[2:30:59] gwenmh: jak doomer tweet Aware
[2:31:03] plimlol: what are ur toughts on unholy and frost dk?
[2:31:03] eggs_boiled: trickets is feint within feints! its a dune reference
[2:31:05] DanteDemonZ: I'm happy holy paladin is gonna be fun again
[2:31:06] jjwallababy: thats a fucking insane take
[2:31:08] Zulimo: feint as a DPS cooldown is so silly
[2:31:15] ShowDUH: @niwaar Theme wise, we have no idea about power or how they gonna be tuned
[2:31:16] darkgigaz: Oracle was worst
[2:31:18] stumie: Feint as a dps cd has gotta be worse than lightsmith
[2:31:18] ArcaneSyntax: I bet actual dollars i don't have that lightsmith gets giga reworked
[2:31:18] Khasi1596: worse than oracle? lol
[2:31:20] DanteDemonZ: I keep forgetting frost DK is a class that exists
[2:31:22] numnumss: check wowhead just made a post about a druid tree
[2:31:22] storm7elemental: trickster is so bad
[2:31:23] stelfbronco: what is so bad about light smith
[2:31:24] LysFe: That's fine then right? idk, 2/3 sounds like a good deal to me
[2:31:27] antipheonixna: @just_ie limited designers prob designer assigned multiple classes and works on one then they other, the not shown ones will prob look better than the early ones like talent trees
[2:31:35] DanteDemonZ: I've seen more Survival Hunters and Affliction locks in M+ than I have Frost DKs ngl
[2:31:39] 74n0: ALOO
[2:31:42] OG_Kawngi: StillWaiting
[2:31:43] Zulimo: We know Oracle is gettinga  rework so i dont think we even compare to Oracle at this point

[2:32:00] LionButLeon: Chatting
[2:32:01] Nirial: It's funny cause I think Lightsmith and Oracle were their super ambitious fun ideas and they have been shot down
[2:32:06] antipheonixna: frost dk needs a rework their gameplay is ass outside of breath
[2:32:07] niwaar: @ShowDUH thats why I ask, i just dont want to see one tree more powerful than the other, so its not my choice its my RL's choice made for me
[2:32:08] Jarlan23: what are tweets called now if its called x
[2:32:08] nine_out_of_ten: I believe we are missing something on feint. They are steering away from using def skills as dps rotation. Like ignore pain on arms warrior.
[2:32:17] gfkoe: @Jarlan23 posts
[2:32:18] DanteDemonZ: who was the rapper whos dis was 'you got twitter but you ain't got no tweets'
[2:32:20] JustRewind: @stelfbronco he has a youtube video if you want a recap of his thoughts
[2:32:22] Madcatmk02: @Nirial ambitious yes fun your mileage may vary
[2:32:30] Jarlan23: @gfkoe thats silly

[2:33:15] yuhhhhe: KEKW
[2:33:16] Nirial: I'm still worried they are putting too much power into the hero trees too. I feel like we already have too much power creep in the live trees
[2:33:17] CloudyHS: @Maximum farming huhs
[2:33:17] clickermekk: How many Deez does it have left Max?

[2:33:26] planooooooooooooooooooooo: i had a pistachio nut that felt weird so i held it under a light and it had a tiny little maggot inside it
[2:33:26] Jazzarus_: having to maintain Jadefire Stomp is the most annoying thing in the world

[2:34:20] storm7elemental: did you read the post from the GM of Nascent yet @Maximum ?
[2:34:20] TyHeals: if 10.2.6 doesn't bring some content that isn't for casuals I'm likely raid logging til S4 lol
[2:34:26] lastericalive: may would be... oof

[2:34:41] Nirial: @buggzymalones If you mean S4 it'll be a fated situation. For war within S1 I assume something to do with nerubians

[2:41:25] syzurup: am i the only one that doesn't know who franc is and at this point is too afraid to ask?
[2:41:26] malnourish_: prob easier now knowing the format and having talked about what you do/dont want to see from hero talents

[2:43:10] Jazzarus_: The text of the Wildstalker Thriving Growth talent is being updated to reflect the latest version of its design. It should read " Wild Growth, Regrowth, and Efflorescence have a chance to cause Symbiotic Blooms to grow on the target…" not Rejuvenation.

[2:43:40] kuromebro: e stands for exponential, so yeah, ^16

[2:43:43] qinlae: 16 0s lol
[2:43:49] Jjmn12: 24 whatever the one above trillion is Wokege
[2:43:51] Rhop: Should try his seed
[2:43:55] bamjaman: defeated by the small blind so sad not even the big boi blind
[2:44:00] JoaEUW: Honestly it looks like they are filming The mist tv show or some shit in your window
[2:44:02] Pyrrha_GG: did he say what his build was?
[2:44:15] B__May: god this game kicks ass

[2:44:49] asd123qwerty1: growl got a fucking insane m+ group going HOLY
[2:44:55] Paleee_: @Maximum 95% of twitter is doomer so thanks for making a positive post lmao

[2:45:44] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge yea, about that
[2:45:48] asd123qwerty1: @zerossussy YUP
[2:45:50] JansonLives: people are just crying about the idea of hero talents for...reasons.
[2:45:51] gfkoe: I am a rogue. This sucks. Where my CDR?
[2:45:53] TDPandorum: They wanted the hero talents to be cosmetic over power
[2:45:58] asd123qwerty1: @zerossussy thats us
[2:45:58] gwenmh: people are just on the 'i dont want any classes to change' train now
[2:46:00] Lenietwitch: duird is a bangeeeeeeeeeeer
[2:46:01] Ristvakbaen1911: Warlock looks good but it's definitely skewed more towards Demo over Destro imo
[2:46:02] Kalamazi: Rogue had a lot of emotion today KEKW
[2:46:03] buggzymalones: youre fryin the dude for glazing you?
[2:46:12] Zulimo: yea invested in at least something
[2:46:13] MissingLobe: big true
[2:46:13] zerossussy: @asd123qwerty1 xdd
[2:46:17] GamerGeek227: Is demolish on the colossus a channel? Like does it root you in place?
[2:46:27] Cloudemon: People were really overly negative because they showed off pi the talent tree and tree boomkin first
[2:46:35] Seroms: NOPE
[2:46:35] CloudyHS: no
[2:46:36] Zulimo: nah
[2:46:37] MissingLobe: not me
[2:46:37] Faraday5001: no
[2:46:38] leubinator: the warriors are very whelmed
[2:46:40] comprises_: nope
[2:46:40] MacauleyGB: nah i love it
[2:46:40] just_ie: @maximum i wonder how mass eruption reacts with ebon might extension
[2:46:44] Suwah84: no
[2:46:46] SleepyPac: not even a little
[2:46:47] zerossussy: they are fine with it

[2:46:52] UnholyGrazer: @Maximum Just dooming on Lightsmith tbh
[2:46:52] DasSlime: some are because it "forces" wake, lol
[2:46:53] zerossussy: most classes i asked about are ok
[2:46:54] Fracke: Warrior is like Meh
[2:46:58] zerossussy: i only heard ppl hated lock?
[2:46:58] Seroms: They are forming camps based on theme though. its funny
[2:46:58] fallb4me: feral/resto is boring
[2:46:58] koxytwitch: @Maximum are you excited to fit 76 specs in 20 mythic slots?
[2:47:01] Drizz_36: that's me Aware
[2:47:03] OG_Kawngi: squidward meme
[2:47:04] MissingLobe: Im annoyed i have to choose between the two awesome specs
[2:47:05] lonelyknight1922: lonelyknight1922 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:47:07] zannuss: Fury main of 18 years and I am hoping slayer is on point cause I don't like mountain thane
[2:47:07] JQ47: Nope. I was gonna reroll when light forged came out but I'm good now
[2:47:08] Zulimo: Druis were like "wtf trees" but this one has been generally positive
[2:47:09] eainzsp: your big
[2:47:10] khaste_G: 5% bigger YEP
[2:47:11] TDPandorum: The issue is, twitter is wanting hero talents to be more cosmetic than power giving.
[2:47:12] zerossussy: rogue is probably the one with the most negatives
[2:47:12] MitchPLZ: Dooming for no talents for some classes. Dopamine required
[2:47:13] Paleee_: @Maximum People arent really dobby about the trees, they just dont like the idea of hero talents at all, they want skins instead
[2:47:14] Keppie__: Nah warrior gets size everything else lost
[2:47:15] CanielD: Templar seems problematic for Shield of the Righteous uptime @Maximum
[2:47:19] BratBranko: Warrior would be fine if they gave 5% size increase per stack of thingy
[2:47:19] NotVacross: meanwhile, feral
[2:47:19] NDRandell: Boomkins rn
[2:47:20] Ferendel: My raid leader is upset Templar isn't defensive but he likes the sound of Lightsmith so his opinion doesn't matter
[2:47:21] Oracle_WoW: nah. 5% bigger is bis
[2:47:21] Versalia315: if thats warrior, what are monks LUL BibleThump
[2:47:23] Windnecro: all ive seen is paladins complaining its boring and not transformative, then other paladins telling them they are idiots and should be happy they arent breaking how good pally already feels
[2:47:25] SleepyPac: the only interesting thing in the colossus tree is them promising to make shockwave takeable
[2:47:28] shambassadors: hope the shaman cook is as good as this expac
[2:47:28] Nekrans: I can't wait for rider of the apocalypse DK that should be an awesome one hopefully
[2:47:31] zerossussy: what
[2:47:32] Monsters27: which of the two hero specs would you think prot warriors go at the moment?
[2:47:32] molo316: Bruh that is NOT A TREE that is the S i use to draw in elementary school
[2:47:33] CloudyHS: HERO SKINS BatChest
[2:47:33] punkekw: Everything just hybrid
[2:47:33] racks22: zzzzzzz
[2:47:35] shepperd19: why cant it be both
[2:47:36] Jazzarus_: skins are dogshit
[2:47:37] klanker: huh?
[2:47:37] relimee0: @Maximum jak tweet
[2:47:37] MissingLobe: who
[2:47:38] xsinker: I do not want skins I want hero talents
[2:47:39] CuteKitkat: one guy
[2:47:39] Oracle_WoW: skins? huh
[2:47:40] zerossussy: skins xdd
[2:47:41] Nekrans: HUH
[2:47:42] Suwah84: ????
[2:47:42] ellasky: agreed
[2:47:43] thegrt13: YEA ITS CRINGE
[2:47:43] Tenatia: wut
[2:47:44] 0alpha12358: lmao
[2:47:44] Ravaldknight: thats the lore wow twitter take lol
[2:47:44] deviljin____: "people" he means casuals on twitter who quit WoW long ago
[2:47:45] Adhonis: huh
[2:47:45] spivet: what even are skins
[2:47:46] CloudyHS: it literally is both
[2:47:47] Nebtaspal: @Maximum is driney less suicidal with herald of the sun
[2:47:47] hotdogmartyr: skins = transmog
[2:47:48] malnourish_: maybe lfr wowhead commenters
[2:47:55] Oracle_WoW: @Maximum get one guyed
[2:47:57] dknamey: Lore dweebs seething on twitter
[2:47:58] Pyrrha_GG: asmon got everyone against hero talents with his video
[2:47:58] antipheonixna: they are 100% making cosmetics around these
[2:47:59] Fevion24: no thanks on skins
[2:48:00] amelia_albarn: yea their problem is that it is both cause power is tied to it
[2:48:03] Azikielboi: does it?
[2:48:10] Azikielboi: doesnt to me personally i guess is all
[2:48:10] Templexx: @Maximum will it impact balancing even more?
[2:48:13] Kemplore: 2 xpacs with talents  = bad
[2:48:15] gwenmh: chatter is correct, that is like 99% of the dobby takes
[2:48:15] syzurup: doesn't something in the warrior tree make you bigger?
[2:48:15] DanteDemonZ: what is dobby? like harry potter?
[2:48:16] buggzymalones: isnt warrior usually the dude inside saying "I want something fun and cool"
[2:48:19] Goodnevi1: If they just did class skins and no new talents, people would complain too.
[2:48:24] JamesTiedye: @Pyrrha_GG Well thankfully asmon is an idiot and shouldnt be taken seriously lol
[2:48:26] FerdaJets: what is the whole skin thing, people just want cosmetic recolours?? Thats so lame
[2:48:26] ashelfal: people assume the covenant issue where ideal visuals doesnt match ideal damage
[2:48:27] MrChaCho: yea. there's a pretty large group of people that want hero talents to be visual basically. I'm 50/50. Cuase some of the stuff could just be parsed out into the main trees
[2:48:29] B__May: If colossus was +50% size I'd play it no matter its performance
[2:48:32] khaste_G: there are enough skins in the game i think
[2:48:34] ctg_dreamz: Basically people are saying they don't want to be forced into a fantasy they dont want to play because of player power
[2:48:35] Suwah84: @maximum people are listening to jak too much and are worried about bloat and complexity when it’s already complex
[2:48:37] headninja1ncharge: Herald of The Sun is gonna slap Im excited to see Sado Pan
[2:48:41] Azikielboi: what about defensive creep @Maximum ?
[2:48:43] Wyvenn: What about lightsmith?
[2:48:46] CloudyHS: its literal pre alpha
[2:48:47] Nebtaspal: @Maximum DRINEY CHECK IS HE OK
[2:48:47] molo316: this is some west coast customs logic.. Yo i heard you like talent trees so we put trees in your trees
[2:48:48] MrChaCho: a lot of people have covenant worries
[2:48:49] Jazzarus_: just make the new talents look cool and that's a sking right there. But gameplay always comes first @Maximum
[2:48:51] d_mag4: Max, that is my last try asking about hardest specs in wow in your opinion
[2:49:01] tribin01: I'd love hero talent unique glyphs or something but it being 100% cosmetic is a dogwater take
[2:49:02] leubinator: why the fuck would ppl want the main feature of the expansion as cosmetic
[2:49:03] surfazing_: Even tho templar reads awesome, i would have loved something like a 2h+shield templar, a bit leaned on crusader from d3
[2:49:05] Zulimo: @Maximum TBH hero talents are for all intents and purposes (when you break it down) just 2 nodes at the bottom of the tree, followed by a few choice nodes, and those two nodes are on 2 specs trees
[2:49:06] kniftty: One day we will see shaman stuff
[2:49:08] SillySmiffy: MORE LIKE THD CHECK
[2:49:08] imjp21: read raid post?
[2:49:10] TL_izPanda: what did thd say
[2:49:14] hankypankieee: big agree, we are looking at pre-alpha trees, plenty of time to change big things
[2:49:14] myst1c1: thd check?
[2:49:14] pendragon925: Tali had a decent point, kind of pointing how this might end up being covenet 2.0. Some might want to play theme but power will overtake. Thinks it should seperate power from theme
[2:49:20] gwenmh: until you force driney to play lightsmith
[2:49:21] Goodnevi1: If Driney is happy, we're happy
[2:49:32] MissingLobe: Very true
[2:49:37] bayazijr: I think hero talents are an opportunity to balance tankiness in the game
[2:49:39] gzok__: thud is still asleep yet still probably already knows the hero tree
[2:49:42] Fraxien: xdd
[2:49:45] Faraday5001: pro bono
[2:49:49] cinBishop: its kinda covenants 2.0 that you can swap freely from day 1 so im ok with it
[2:49:50] spivet: when you break it down hero talents are just talents but more heroic
[2:49:53] Oracle_WoW: unintentional bit
[2:49:54] Jazzarus_: they are just separating them to not fuck with combinatorics, which is smart btw
[2:49:59] CloudyHS: @Maximum tldr is dent heads on twitter misunderstood what blizzard said these are, wanted class skins, and are mad they are not class skins
[2:50:00] periperus: More Baltro when?
[2:50:01] molo316: instead of growing the tree lets just make a apple fall from it and you can pick one up
[2:50:05] Templexx: @Maximum more things to balance
[2:50:07] Nebtaspal: if u force driney to play lightsmith he would probably jump off a bridge LOL
[2:50:11] Windnecro: they should have just framed these as like 2 new talents instead of being "class identity" or whatnot, people put too much into it after they showed off things like the new stormbolt animation for thane
[2:50:11] str6lch: @maximum is liquid going to put out rwf-like content at the beginning of season 4? what’s the guild schedule for that season like?
[2:50:13] Zulimo: @Maximum thats the bit, people think they are more than that, they are stupid simple but poeple thing they are more than that
[2:50:24] CloudyHS: keeper of the grove
[2:50:32] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Jazzarus_ Combin....... wtf
[2:50:43] Goodnevi1: I kinda like wildstalker
[2:50:45] Jazzarus_: @BLACKFOOT_TN yep, that's a word, look it up
[2:50:48] Azikielboi: would you say the hero talents are pro bono?
[2:50:55] antipheonixna: i wanna bite things not have a trinket proc
[2:50:55] Camelbak21: Idk, looks fine to me
[2:50:59] roadkiill7: abyssal domination for destro warlock feels really bad unless they move cata’s place on the destro tree
[2:51:06] CloudyHS: tldr is dent heads on twitter misunderstood what blizzard said these are, wanted class skins, and are mad they are not class skins
[2:51:10] SillySmiffy: The evoker one looks fun to me
[2:51:11] amelia_albarn: for them it's like "I wanna be a dark ranger but it's actually bad in dps so I cant be one and have to pick another hero talent that doesnt have my spec fantasy but performs well"
[2:51:12] syzurup: i don't see anything to help boomies live
[2:51:25] thendj: pick a spec i volunteer
[2:51:27] Basic_3: Give me power over Mage and I'll show you what I'm cutting
[2:51:34] Sover31gn: Blizz teased with the mountain warrior one that there will be some cosmetics diffy
[2:51:37] Ristvakbaen1911: Get rid of Siphon Life x.x
[2:51:37] NotVacross: wildstalker is super boring, and will entirely depend on tuning.  There's almost zero gameplay implications with it.  it doesn't "feel" heroic and is very obvious that it got less love than palad/lock
[2:51:43] alarkin: I think hero talents are cool but that TWW is going to come down to a reimagining of mythic+ and mythic raiding, because in their current form they just work super great with the seasonal format. I'm looking forward to seeing how Blizz addresses them.
[2:51:44] MitchPLZ: Civilians don't like the fantasy tied to power. They want to be a dark ranger, but if it's not more damage, then they'll be mad.
[2:51:45] eainzsp: too many modifiers and defensives
[2:51:46] Slandii: feels like there are just way too many modifiers for abilities in the game. Im fine with new buttons, but endless modifiers to track kinda sucks
[2:51:47] antipheonixna: it depends right u cant add a button to enhance/ww/feral really but can easily do it with warrior and ret
[2:51:47] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Jazzarus_ Brb looking up Greek words because that makes me look smarterdester.
[2:51:57] auby6: ele just wants raid buff and defensives
[2:51:58] UnheardGrace: I'm really worried about how hero talents will carry on into future expansions. it smells like borrowed power in the technical bloat sort of way
[2:52:02] iklad: wildstalker looks good for catweaving resto, but thats dependant on plenty of others choices. I'm kinda excited about it as a main rdruid
[2:52:04] SpaceNachos: Paladins need more defensives.
[2:52:07] jaffybara: I think the worst takes I have seen have been people calling this stuff Covenant stuff and shit
[2:52:08] fallb4me: where are the boomkin defensives tho
[2:52:08] Zulimo: I think people want it to be a whole system, its like 5 new talents and thats it
[2:52:09] Jazzarus_: @BLACKFOOT_TN not greek, it's english, lmao
[2:52:10] Jesdawow: man really is putting nuts in his mouth HUH
[2:52:10] calibratedlol: Why do we always have to wait the longest time for Monk talents BibleThump
[2:52:11] SpaceNachos: [J/K please don't ban me]
[2:52:13] Azikielboi: so no new defensives should be in hero trees unless its like feral/balance?
[2:52:15] Zombizard: hero talents are just new talents like they used to do, instead of borrowed power. and Im hype for it
[2:52:16] LionButLeon: TrollDespair
[2:52:21] davernt: Are you going to read that forum post about mythic raiding?
[2:52:24] molo316: when you lust you get a DR BatChest
[2:52:25] koxytwitch: capstone 2 charges on reinc
[2:52:25] numnumss: does ele end up going support ?
[2:52:27] Keionys_: What do you think the chance that a rework for Monks is coming which is why they havn't been shown at all for hero talents? Kinda like how they annoucned warr changes to the tree.
[2:52:28] IEatAxe13: Does resto shaman "need" a raid buff?
[2:52:28] bayazijr: they didnt give dk's a raid buff
[2:52:28] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Do you think we'll actually get anything interesting for the middle child of wow: the monk?
[2:52:30] Doenos: welp siphon life can go :) aswell as malefic rapture, as a start
[2:52:30] captainnetz: Please no we need less raid buffs not more
[2:52:32] rottisxd: its just gonna be BoD battleshaman
[2:52:32] str6lch: @maximum is liquid going to put out rwf-like content at the beginning of season 4? what’s the guild schedule for that season like?
[2:52:33] LionButLeon: at least defensive(s) would be nice xdd
[2:52:36] lastericalive: ░S░H░A░M░A░N░I░N░B░I░O░
[2:52:36] masterdannix: No shaman trees released might be a bad sign
[2:52:36] Doomedsaint: Hopefully the resto/ele shaman bring back Vesper
[2:52:38] enappl3: Ele needs a rework so badly
[2:52:39] its_blando: putting a raid buff in the hero talents would be diabolical
[2:52:39] auby6: farseer
[2:52:41] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Jazzarus_ ok
[2:52:47] Keppie__: That would be so weird would remove choice
[2:52:51] jjwallababy: In a perfect world, men like me do not exist
[2:52:51] dlllont: everyone is special
[2:52:54] Al_Jangus: Al_Jangus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:52:54] LionButLeon: @captainnetz 2 specs dont have it, so its dumb to not give
[2:52:55] Sanctos304: wouldn't that force ele/resto to play that hero tree then usually?
[2:52:56] auby6: they need it
[2:52:57] molo316: spirit link totem is raid wide and connected to lust BatChest
[2:52:57] krygore_09: Then that tree becomes mandatory
[2:52:58] Northern_man: It felt very good when my idea of wildstalker i posted on mmo-champ weeks ago came true.
[2:53:01] spivet: I hope the reason we havent seen any shaman stuff yet is ele is getting a big rework
[2:53:02] Nyraell: "lust also gives 30% dr"
[2:53:04] slappadabas5: Playing ele since vanilla...i'm not optimistic
[2:53:06] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I mean, they could easily just remove raid buffs, why is it have to be "not the world we live in" as if Blizzard can't bring change LUL
[2:53:07] WolfgangAmpersand: Each raid boss should be available from 2 different class.
[2:53:09] mortenerenroleplayer123: if we had no raid buffs, would you not see alot of class stacking?
[2:53:09] NotVacross: if only we had some sort of, piece of paper, or something, that could replace raid buffs.  Like a scroll?
[2:53:10] Aqinog: do DKs have a raid buff or is grip their buff
[2:53:13] malnourish_: good shout
[2:53:15] antipheonixna: think how many tools a druid has plus they have one of the best raid buffs and shamans cry
[2:53:16] JamesTiedye: Yea Ele feels so weird because every other class does what Ele does but better
[2:53:16] scrapps1: what were your opinions on dark ranger compared to these?
[2:53:19] BLACKFOOT_TN: Shaman's aren't real people anyways. Next class.
[2:53:29] Coriollis: @WolfgangAmpersand or 2 different specs from same class
[2:53:29] Voodoohunter: Voodoohunter subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 84 months! New Goat?
[2:53:38] antipheonixna: its shit compared to these ones
[2:53:39] zerossussy: @Nyraell this is the first season where M+ is massively being played without lust, its good when its not entirely needed
[2:53:40] CloudyHS: crazy that 2 years ago we were still dealing with covenants, blizzard flipped the script fr
[2:53:41] molo316: shaman tree when you dont crit with riptide you get a dr Kappa
[2:53:42] Zulimo: I think they coulda done themselves alot of favors by not calling them hero talents, but they wanted thematic flavor
[2:53:45] antipheonixna: same with like sanalyn
[2:53:49] Camelbak21: Now, hear me out, what if they nerf all raid buffs by 90%?
[2:53:57] nightSkyy: I missed rogue take, cliff notes?
[2:53:58] auby6: @JamesTiedye kinda wild u say this and dont look at council logs, ele is number 2 on coucil.. a meme fight but yea
[2:54:10] hankypankieee: my biggest fear right now is that they released all the good ones today and the rest are kind of mid
[2:54:15] vaypurr: ***
[2:54:20] maxmorey: @nightSkyy dobby
[2:54:22] Nickystr1x: trickster: rest in piss u wont be missed
[2:54:25] Shirey12: @Maximum what're you maining for War Within based on these hero talents?
[2:54:29] LionButLeon: @auby6 true, ele does good on 3 targets, which doesn't exist often. so who cares xdd
[2:54:31] nightSkyy: Word
[2:54:33] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge
[2:54:37] Pechorin333: imagine if bear forming was a dps buff for moonkin
[2:54:37] TL_izPanda: @auby6 if your response is “check council logs” you’ve lost the argument
[2:54:38] Northern_man: Did you read every blurp on these specs from official site?
[2:54:42] nemziac: from the bottom of my heart, fuck that
[2:54:42] LionButLeon: @TL_izPanda THIS
[2:54:44] UnheardGrace: for those who don't play rogue, what is feint

[2:54:51] CloudyHS: HAMMER PALADIN
[2:54:54] jjwallababy: LIGHTSMITH PALADIN
[2:54:54] SillySmiffy: Go aug evoker
[2:54:55] ghostdog_xd: feint isn't even a fun button to press, costs too much energy to ever feel good in any other specc than outlaw
[2:54:56] Slandii: i really like Trickster talents for PvP tho tbh
[2:54:58] malnourish_: he's maining lightsmith

[2:55:11] ThoseCrazyGuys: He's maining holy pally Pog
[2:55:12] LionButLeon: @auby6 nice "Meme"
[2:55:13] Windnecro: @UnheardGrace 15 second cd defensive on the global, its why rogues have an answer to every mechanic ever
[2:55:13] JamesTiedye: @auby6 Fair I should be less absolute. Ele is only really good in very specific fights such as council or Amalgamtion chamber
[2:55:14] Goodnevi1: Pally power!
[2:55:17] zannuss: Faith Father making a come back
[2:55:20] rudejerk: will you use two name changes to make your ret horseboy

[2:55:32] holyrs: and firefrost
[2:55:33] malnourish_: maximum mage arc?
[2:55:36] Coriollis: we need the dk real bad
[2:55:37] TheItalianStallion321: DH only 2 specs yet cant release a hero talent yet
[2:55:38] Keionys_: Both Prot Pally hero tree's suck because you still have to recast consecrate when you move
[2:55:39] spivet: shamans removed in war within
[2:55:39] drewsky96: slayer for warrior better fucking pipe

[2:55:52] CloudyHS: baseg
[2:55:55] LionButLeon: baseg
[2:55:56] d_mag4: totemic shaman that’s what I’m waiting for
[2:55:57] TL_izPanda: they could honestly just release enhance shaman hero tree as “keep season 3 set bonus” and it would be the best one
[2:55:59] Paleee_: Monk is probably the next class that would be reworked
[2:56:01] SleepyPac: based
[2:56:04] dlllont: ret has big range for melee. will you be half bad at it?
[2:56:04] hankypankieee: melee brain

[3:05:08] leubinator: he is trying to change the subject from .6
[3:05:09] Arcinatos: "majority" LuL
[3:05:09] meeseherd: meeseherd subscribed with Prime. 
[3:05:13] Camelbak21: Skins are boring
[3:05:14] splashz0r: @hotdogmartyr bad take class skins own
[3:05:14] MissingLobe: You mean like lock fel flames?
[3:05:16] Azikielboi: "majority"
[3:05:16] daggerd314: @hotdogmartyr the take is power creep
[3:05:17] Arcinatos: casuals would love class skins
[3:05:21] Benjg7: vocal minority
[3:05:21] GooseComics: yeah ok.. majority..
[3:05:24] edangus23: ive literally never heard of skins before but i immediately dislike and dont even understand
[3:05:29] Standy94: Trickster rogue is dog for outlaw
[3:05:33] antipheonixna: over correction from covenants
[3:05:36] cosmopanda13: you can have both new talents and class skins and have them separate so you are not forced into a fantasy
[3:05:37] tribin01: Jack has been giving that take a ton it's really annoying
[3:05:42] zannuss: Single minded fury says hi
[3:05:44] CloudyHS: firstgarf
[3:05:46] ctops2000: I think part of the class skins argument comes from people upset that glyphs are underutilized, which I get.
[3:05:48] pnguinwow: arent class skins just tiersets
[3:05:48] Goodnevi1: Right but they 100% would complain if there was no new talents in the xpac
[3:05:52] Shirey12: @Maximum watch AutomaticJak's take on it
[3:06:00] auby6: button bloat does exist though
[3:06:04] ogbuckwheats: #BRINGBAKJAK #MAKETHEMDIGREATAGAIN
[3:06:05] CloudyHS: its an MMO, button bloat is the name of the game
[3:06:06] racks22: ice strike
[3:06:08] DutchGameLab: just remove balance druid garf
[3:06:10] Azikielboi: 10 is too many but i think many could remove 2 @Maximum
[3:06:12] Word2BigBird: brewmaster monkaS
[3:06:15] Kdubsf226: thats BM hunters whole kit, 10 spells XD
[3:06:15] planooooooooooooooooooooo: distract
[3:06:17] Rhop: Also most of these replace buttons, not add them
[3:06:18] gwenmh: i can remove 5 spells from brew easily
[3:06:19] Jazzarus_: dota 2 has a HUGE new player issue
[3:06:19] Kryous: My only issue is that some of the trees on Live need more work imo. I'd like to see that done BEFORE the Hero Talents, so here's hoping. Prayge
[3:06:19] Azikielboi: VDH could easily remove 2 buttons
[3:06:28] SleepyPac: i could maybe get to like 5 if i tried hard and was careless
[3:06:30] CeasBricks: slice and dice :D
[3:06:32] asd123qwerty1: @maximum is 10.2.6 fated or is that something different?
[3:06:32] MrChaCho: The bit I've seen the most of is fear taht it'll be Covenants 2.0. Where people might want to be a Dark Ranger, because it's cool for them, but the other option is 10% better so they can't be the cooler thing
[3:06:32] CloudyHS: @Maximum if u want no buttons go play classic, honestly , its there for a reason
[3:06:33] IamBadSry: @zannuss remove it. Let warriors mog 2hders into one handers. Profit
[3:06:36] Benjg7: why 10 buttons?
[3:06:36] Raggu2: Some specs have more than 10 that could be taken away.
[3:06:39] ryzenrt: why remove button, so irrelevent
[3:06:43] ryzenrt: make game feel shit
[3:06:46] Ojomon_: @maximum they don’t want to be “forced” into playing something that doesn’t fit the class fantasy they want because of power
[3:06:48] nemziac: its so much
[3:06:58] OG_Kawngi: I had that issue with Destiny 2 a while ago
[3:07:02] Boreall: Button Bloat has some really valid problems from a healer perspective. Most healers need both DPS and Healer buttons on their bars, so we're talking 40-50 buttons sometimes
[3:07:03] zannuss: I wish they would
[3:07:13] Milano___: I think we are getting a pretty big game reset after the World Soul saga
[3:07:15] JakeParkbench: healers have like 40 buttons
[3:07:17] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Spirit transfer, strike of the wind lord, chi burst, chi wave, expel harm, whirling dragon punch, faeline stomp, avert harm.
[3:07:19] Faraday5001: jak
[3:07:19] thatoneguynobodylikes352: There I did it.
[3:07:21] Standy94: I'm running out of keybinds honestyl
[3:07:22] Azikielboi: fleks @Maximum
[3:07:23] CloudyHS: HUH SKINLORD
[3:07:25] lonelyknight1922: i think most covenant abilities kinda suck with a few exceptions
[3:07:26] Stauss: HUH
[3:07:27] DutchGameLab: HUH
[3:07:28] Rhop: Skinlord? HUH
[3:07:28] kuromebro: skinnie
[3:07:29] yuhhhhe: SKINLORD HUH
[3:07:29] tribin01: Jak
[3:07:29] Azikielboi: fleks and jak
[3:07:31] Rzayers: jak has pushed for it
[3:07:31] antipheonixna: they should add cosmetic content with the hero talents relase
[3:07:32] DutchGameLab: foreskinlord
[3:07:32] headninja1ncharge: Skin Lord is crazy
[3:07:32] MrChaCho: Heidi!
[3:07:32] CoffeeASAP: I think Taliesen made a vid about it
[3:07:35] TheItalianStallion321: HEIDI
[3:07:37] LionButLeon: Heidi Pog
[3:07:37] Guffels: Fleks but he deleted tweet
[3:07:41] cosmopanda13: Taliesin is a big advocate
[3:07:41] Milano___: Jak is the skinlord?
[3:07:41] spivet: I feel like if a skin is purely cosmetic and has no gameplay impact why even bother. Like if youre a dark ranger but play exactly like any other MM hunter are you really a dark ranger?
[3:07:44] gwenmh: jak, taliesen
[3:07:47] Jarlan23: it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
[3:07:48] Azikielboi: @Guffels wiat he did? why???
[3:07:50] Shirey12: Jak put out a video on youtube @Maximum
[3:07:50] chadderz7: xdd
[3:07:55] zannuss: Yeah I dont use shift modifiers and I am out of binds any more crap and I'll be clicking
[3:07:55] DutchGameLab: healer takes garf
[3:08:00] OG_Kawngi: I think Publik didn't like em
[3:08:00] CloudyHS: thats just 1 person
[3:08:05] Azikielboi: has  vid about it
[3:08:06] Azikielboi: yeye

[3:09:54] Shirey12: yep
[3:09:55] sorostrike: Asmon editors gunna eat you up now

[3:10:02] Shirey12: noooo
[3:10:05] auby6: u said that last week lol
[3:10:12] Jarlan23: watch it nao
[3:10:12] Thecustomdude: @Maximum have you review the new hero talent?
[3:10:26] Standy94: Yes the Outlaw rage! I agree
[3:10:28] Cloudemon: you cant please spriest man
[3:10:33] gwenmh: DIESOFCRINGE
[3:10:34] Jazzarus_: what an L take
[3:10:36] Boreall: I think that's a really weak take
[3:10:37] CloudyHS: DIESOFCRINGE
[3:10:37] Zaisx: also disagree
[3:10:38] Thatorphankid20: hes right
[3:10:38] GooseComics: Is he mad becuse he hasn't seen shadow priest??
[3:10:39] zerossussy: i completely disagree too
[3:10:40] Camelbak21: disagree yea
[3:10:42] Boreall: Talents as cosmetics would be AWFUL
[3:10:44] tribin01: All the priests giving bad takes
[3:10:46] Raggu2: hero talents are just artifact weapons 2.0. Theyre fine
[3:10:46] Marne_: shadow priest man being a doomer. what a shock.
[3:10:51] fizzis_: we're going up 10 levels... and u want the systems to be the same?? thats whack
[3:10:53] holyrs: they are trash
[3:10:54] Cloudemon: typical spriest take
[3:10:55] antipheonixna: this is the best chance to fresh up wows classes ever
[3:10:56] Kryous: @GooseComics Not mad, just scared.
[3:10:57] TwoThousandOne: priests have dogshit takes, what else is new
[3:10:58] Azikielboi: what if the coolest hero talents were part of global talent tree reworks @Maximum
[3:10:59] holyrs: more weakauras , thanks blizzard
[3:10:59] Standy94: Ask James about Outlaw. I'm sure he has a spicy opinion
[3:10:59] lonelyknight1922: read the tweet below it
[3:11:00] pnguinwow: if i went into a new expansion and my class just had 0 new buttons id quit
[3:11:01] Rilix: destro talents are just them telling you that you should have been playing demo
[3:11:05] Azikielboi: like what if every single spec got a talent tree rework
[3:11:10] Thatorphankid20: I dont think blizzard can make them fun or interesting. Im happy to be wrong though
[3:11:10] MrChaCho: Let's see their take when a sick priest tree gets dropped
[3:11:11] wasp234: I love when gameplay gets innovated so hard disagree with publik there
[3:11:11] Shirey12: you should def watch that video
[3:11:16] szakal_TV: this music funky as fuck
[3:11:17] cosmopanda13: wouldn't it be better to have them separately?
[3:11:18] xrandomdoodx: @Maximum I think a big issue people have with hero talents is that they are gonna be pretty impossible to balance properly
[3:11:22] nathanpayson: Player power shouldnt be tied to player fantasy
[3:11:23] Oracle_WoW: feel like you wouldnt interact with it after week 3
[3:11:27] winterr555: @Maximum Artifact weapons 2.0 should come with some cool cosmetic options too imo
[3:11:30] Crytikul: max did you already look at all the new hero talents?
[3:11:30] auby6: just bring glyphs back and let it change the color of your spells
[3:11:32] Azikielboi: what time is it now?
[3:11:32] GooseComics: @Kryous because of one bad talent tree that immediatly got a response from blizzard saying they are going to change it, and all the others are pretty bangers?
[3:11:33] gwenmh: if they were cosmetic only war within would be completely barren; we get what, delves???
[3:11:34] Azikielboi: party time?
[3:11:36] iceeeyx: just imagine getting a new expansion and you get some transmog stuff only XD
[3:11:37] Jazzarus_: now is the time for nuts
[3:11:38] aragarde: so instead of hero talents should they do refreshed reworks every couple of patches? @Maximum
[3:11:39] DutchGameLab: its time for garf
[3:11:39] Goatsguffle: Has there been any new additions to the raid team since this last race?
[3:11:43] spiritcheese: dawg time
[3:11:46] wasp234: garf
[3:11:46] holyrs: whats the point of this talent tree you got in the screen, i changes nothing , just adds a bunch of shti passives
[3:11:46] CloudyHS: dawg
[3:11:46] TheItalianStallion321: its not time, thats the time
[3:11:46] Jarlan23: its tool time
[3:11:46] highcard2: time to vibe bois
[3:11:47] MissingLobe: DAMNIT
[3:11:47] Standy94: Rip
[3:11:48] Azikielboi: garf time?
[3:11:48] TwoThousandOne: Adge
[3:11:48] payloon: time for balantro
[3:11:50] lonelyknight1922: Maximum showing me what living without ADHD is like wow
[3:11:50] maddi_: garf
[3:11:53] JustJoshin____: democracy?
[3:11:55] Gwedo18: if you dont think its time for that vidoe then your judgjment on time is c Tier !!!
[3:12:01] Ruinx81: ads
[3:12:03] Sekrai: Still wondering if the power stuff and cosmetic stuff shouldn't be seperated, if Covenants let you pick whichever power you wanted seperated from which covenant you joined it would've felt a lot better for example
[3:12:05] santalylth: love these music btw
[3:12:06] antipheonixna: max who needs a rework and why is it frost dk
[3:12:07] Gwedo18: jk i dont evne know what video we talking about :0 hope your doing well today max
[3:12:07] wasp234: gard
[3:12:12] Shpicey: what is this wow stuff i thought this was a balatro streamer
[3:12:13] m_dep: I think it is a fair concern that stuff like hero talents will make balancing turbo hard
[3:12:13] smolderdaddyuwu: Time for Nascent GM article
[3:12:14] Faraday5001: wtf is this playlist
[3:12:14] shokhmon: gard
[3:12:21] fizzis_: wheres my dk reworks SMH same thing since legion
[3:12:22] Kryous: @GooseComics Nah, just Shadow Priest talent history has been scary. Each expansion the person working on them left Blizzard, 4 or 5 times now.
[3:12:37] OG_Kawngi: BatChest
[3:12:38] CloudyHS: dark ranger
[3:12:39] LionButLeon: BatChest
[3:12:39] razortanktv: instead of hero talents they should do spearow talents that turn you into a bird
[3:12:40] IamBadSry: The issue is you have camps of people. One camp doesn't like their specs core gameplay loop. So they want hero talents to "fix" their specs. Another want's cosmetic class skins. Another want's no more button bloat. Which leads the discussion being pulled ten different ways.
[3:12:41] Azikielboi: dark ranger ICANT
[3:12:42] gwenmh: soulbinds still existed
[3:12:43] wasp234: dark ranger
[3:12:43] OG_Kawngi: BatChest dark ranger
[3:12:45] zerossussy: dark ranger
[3:12:46] Sekrai: Dark ranger
[3:12:56] cookie2505: I want wow 2.0 purely for a new more powerful engine. it’s insane what they’ve done with the old engine but imagine what they could do with a new one
[3:12:59] Tanonn: hunter shadow BASED
[3:12:59] fizzis_: DARK HUNTER  ICANT ICANT
[3:13:01] SpaEngi: TrollDespair hunter
[3:13:04] GooseComics: @Kryous ok so this is a shadow priest being scared of shadow priest stuff. He needs to look objectively and see that the hero talents seem to be working well
[3:13:05] bertramacles: but then they can rework dark ranger
[3:13:06] BLACKFOOT_TN: Look all I want is NO MORE BUTTONS. All I am asking.
[3:13:09] DutchGameLab: wow 2.0 is such a meme
[3:13:11] holyrs: no they are not
[3:13:11] rottisxd: what if its not strong as other ones. then its just dead content
[3:13:15] smolderdaddyuwu: Dark shadow
[3:13:16] JoaEUW: What are we listening to?
[3:13:16] Gwedo18: When do hero talents come out chat?
[3:13:16] Jazzarus_: nah, just do it together, make hero talents impact gameplay AND also be the skins
[3:13:17] raja17_: Check that damn forum post everybody talking about @maximum
[3:13:22] bertramacles: people just overreacting
[3:13:25] zerossussy: time for them to redesign every spell's look and call it a day
[3:13:25] napaholictv: Any cats in the chat!!!
[3:13:27] holyrs: whats cool about elunes chosen
[3:13:32] jedrad: @Gwedo18 next xpac
[3:13:32] ShowDUH: @Gwedo18 11.0 Prepatch
[3:13:38] CloudyHS: soulbinds
[3:13:40] Kryous: @GooseComics Probably, it's just the years of abuse feeling. Ya know? Dread and all that.
[3:13:48] Milano___: @DutchGameLab This isn't 2.0. That will come after the World Soul saga IMO
[3:13:52] Rhop: People talking about button bloat like most of these trees don't just replace an existing button with a different button.
[3:13:54] fizzis_: now everyone already has their covenant abiliteis KEKW YEP
[3:13:55] tribin01: @Maximum At that point you could make that argument about anything game play related. Why not have 1 class that plays the same and you just pick what class effects you have. It's goofy af
[3:14:00] gwenmh: how does class skins work for something like oracle which doesnt have the cache as dark ranger or sanlayn though
[3:14:03] OldFlorrysGhost: sure they can balance it within 1% of each other, people will still play the one that's 1% better
[3:14:07] GooseComics: @Kryous i mean its true. Shadow Priest needs a talent revamp. its been one patch and they are indeed way over due.
[3:14:10] DutchGameLab: @Milano___ nah I think wow 2.0 is a perma fake idea
[3:14:11] auby6: its more comparable to conduit trees
[3:14:13] Kryous: @Kryous I say that when Shadow has been good recently, but the tree is still kind of a mess overall. Numbers just being strong really.
[3:14:21] darkgigaz: Same people saying they like them will complain when there are not even remotely balanced as it adds another layer of depth.
[3:14:38] fizzis_: elune is def looking like the better one
[3:14:40] OldFlorrysGhost: blood elf and night elf literally have the same buff - 1% crit
[3:14:41] captainnetz: Nothing in these trees so far has been so bonkers that people need to pick one. Covenants had multiple for each class that HAD to be picked
[3:15:00] SillySmiffy: All I know is alpha/beta is gonna be SICK
[3:15:13] mozerra: if balance is good that would be sick
[3:15:14] fizzis_: elune gives boomkins defensive value - automatic pick
[3:15:15] CloudyHS: it was ion
[3:15:17] Zarroe: dont nelves have haste at night or something
[3:15:21] Guko97: insane source
[3:15:22] LionButLeon: WAYTOODANK
[3:15:22] Hu33ard: @OldFlorrysGhost belf can gain fury
[3:15:25] auby6: i mean at the end of the day they cant make every player happy
[3:15:31] Jazzarus_: today's trees are so good, that I hate paladins, and I'm considering playing one cause those trees look cool
[3:15:33] Rzayers: as long as tuning is close enough most people will be ok with giving up the "optimal" hero talent for the one they identify with the most
[3:15:38] pjcurtin: i feel the class skin thing only works for some classes/specs. like i dont think people are going to be dying to be a colossus over a slayer for example
[3:15:39] equinox_flare: always trust what One Guy said
[3:15:39] Azikielboi: its not nothing
[3:15:40] GooseComics: thats not insignificant
[3:15:48] zenkodac: We playing telephone game over here XD
[3:15:56] CloudyHS: u cant have 2 things be perfeclty balanced, the alternative is just no choice so the balance difference doesnt matter
[3:16:01] LionButLeon: reppy t Pog
[3:16:02] KaisenSiru: anniesCute anniesCute
[3:16:03] spiritcheese: dawg
[3:16:05] Azikielboi: holy shit hes a dog
[3:16:06] captainnetz: These feel more like tier sets to me more than azerite armor was. Small bonus and gameplay changes
[3:16:07] LionButLeon: dawg
[3:16:08] GooseComics: wait.. does twitch even have a OneGuy twitch name lol?
[3:16:12] CloudyHS: dawg
[3:16:18] CloudyHS: HeyGuys
[3:16:20] cookie2505: I want wow 2.0 purely for a new more powerful engine. it’s insane what they’ve done with the old engine but imagine what they could do with a new one
[3:16:23] TDPandorum: dawg
[3:16:28] Jarlan23: is he smart? i have a super happy dog but shes an idiot
[3:16:29] skeebod: dawg
[3:16:34] Gwedo18: i love the dog in the back just looiking to see if any treats or food is givin out to the other puppy
[3:16:34] MRYssen: How did you deal with them being puppies while also not having them consume your life? :D  We have a 10 week old puppy  and damn it takes some energy
[3:16:36] fizzis_: HUH
[3:16:37] GooseComics: oh he does! /oneguy has 5 followers
[3:16:42] CloudyHS: LMFAO dude a new engine is like 4 years worth of dev time, be so fucking real
[3:16:45] Lirnril: 2.0 for new base ui lol
[3:16:45] menzlo: Engines get updated
[3:16:45] zerossussy: u can just buy an amd cpu and ur fine
[3:16:51] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121355 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_maximum #ad
[3:16:55] Standy94: People with engine takes are in the wrong stream
[3:16:56] Camelbak21: You don't just "get a new engine" and everything feels the same
[3:16:57] Boreall: Don't they upgrade their engine every xpac?
[3:16:58] mariqlol: they defo need a engine upgrade
[3:16:59] zenkodac: As long as they port everything from the original i would be ok with that
[3:17:00] GooseComics: Tswift lag.... please.....
[3:17:00] auby6: so much spahgetti code with old game
[3:17:02] MissingLobe: idk thats a ton of content to look over
[3:17:02] its_blando: Valdrakken tanks my fps
[3:17:05] Oracle_WoW: why do people think the engine is 20 years old?
[3:17:08] pendragon925: yeah its rough
[3:17:09] xxMaverick: tindral slideshow anyone?
[3:17:10] Goodnevi1: People dumped 20 years into a character, WoW 2.0 isn't going to go well
[3:17:12] gwenmh: wow 2.0 for armor dyes and better looking robes and shit
[3:17:14] CloudyHS: rebuilding wow in a new engine would take like, 4-5 years MINIMUM
[3:17:14] FerdaJets: THe fps drop in combat is insane
[3:17:15] the_great_simonator: currently in a 25 man and it's tankin my frames
[3:17:16] shepperd19: NEW ENGINE
[3:17:17] Aveeeeek: @CloudyHS it could be in the works for past 5 already, u dont know
[3:17:18] Standy94: Who tf designed the nymue particles
[3:17:18] fizzis_: i just turn everyones effect off besides mine
[3:17:20] Livid_Lycan: Tindral 2nd root set when everyone self breaks is awful
[3:17:20] sarrowzthewarlock: my pc woould melt with a new engine lol
[3:17:20] GooseComics: @Oracle_WoW because it is..
[3:17:20] FroTheBeard: TayTay lag during the root breaks is terrible
[3:17:21] Coriollis: wow doesnt need cyberpunk level engine, just the most that can run on average pc's
[3:17:21] Milano___: I see it as a world reset
[3:17:25] Aemon__: 1 global server Pog
[3:17:26] FroTheBeard: even with just 20
[3:17:27] paragorr: i have an i9 and 3080 and i lag hard on some fights in amirdrassil lol
[3:17:27] zerossussy: the new 7800x3d cpu is really great for that, and the newer ones are getting good for wow
[3:17:28] Jazzarus_: that's wow 2 right there
[3:17:29] DocThuggly: we've been in wow 2.0 since they upgraded all the models and completely changed talent trees
[3:17:29] bigmeanbeefy: needs a better "hide eye candy" option tbh, i think that takes alot of power to show
[3:17:29] Zaisx: dragonflight is wow 2
[3:17:35] fzybny: I'm fine with keeping everything and give us a new engine.
[3:17:35] MrChaCho: backend rework with the game otherwise not really changing. kinda like CS2.
[3:17:39] CloudyHS: especially with warbands
[3:17:43] auby6: wow 2.0 means a more streamline experience and purpose, easier to develope for with new engine
[3:17:44] shepperd19: NEW ENGINE, DYES, player housing, more evergreen. updated combat system
[3:17:44] Oracle_WoW: @GooseComics you still running windows 1.0?
[3:17:50] menzlo: It's different enough from 1.0 that there's different clients
[3:17:50] hyeheal: game needs an engine update real bad
[3:17:54] fizzis_: youd have to get a new team that knows the new engine
[3:17:59] Jarlan23: it needs to happen if they want to attract new players
[3:18:01] Grissu_: wow 2 should be new engine based on the old one. Not like u5 or something
[3:18:03] its_blando: wow 2 with the same zones and mounts or people rage lmao
[3:18:04] menzlo: Yep just update
[3:18:09] zelrock__: I would rather have better content
[3:18:09] bigmeanbeefy: Its practial for the future, but its WAY to expensive to invest in
[3:18:10] arclightheals: The pay off wouldnt be worth the cost
[3:18:12] juvell2: The engine is getting updated all the time...
[3:18:12] auby6: ancient tech
[3:18:13] fizzis_: @Jarlan23 no it doesnt KEKW
[3:18:14] CloudyHS: @Maximum the cost of wow on a new engine is essentially all content paused for 3-5 years
[3:18:15] numnumss: just wait a few years and have ai port wow to a new engine?
[3:18:16] GooseComics: @Oracle_WoW huh? do you know that the wow engine is a modified warcraft 3 engine?
[3:18:20] ShadowBites: It is a massive migration project that would take a couple years at best. But I agree they should begin that journey.
[3:18:21] Sover31gn: Engine take is pretty baseless imo
[3:18:22] Blurstinger: For what? lol, because wow feels old af
[3:18:24] cosmopanda13: do people really want to lose everything they have right now for a new engine?
[3:18:25] sence_00: A huge part of WoWs appeal is it's unique goofy visuals, it would be so much worse if it looked like every other game
[3:18:25] adardrae: please give a quick explanation of what a new engine would do differently than the current one
[3:18:32] menzlo: I want my character to look hot
[3:18:33] shepperd19: make wow look like BDO kekw
[3:18:37] CloudyHS: RAYTRACING BatChest
[3:18:37] GooseComics: WoW graphics are fine.
[3:18:39] its_blando: the graphics are fine to me
[3:18:39] ShadowBites: Graphics are fine.
[3:18:40] Coriollis: maybe after the trilogy when they could start from scratch , make a new wow with new engine
[3:18:40] OG_Kawngi: DLSS :)
[3:18:41] Azikielboi: they acnt do animations to show abilities well @Maximum
[3:18:42] KaptinKazual: @Maximum The FPS issue is directed tied to the age of the engine and code.  all newer engines have MUCH better decoding and smoother processing.
[3:18:43] zebracak35: better graphics = lower fps
[3:18:44] berchberkins: graphics is the most overrated thing ever
[3:18:45] Lirnril: if wow 2 would exist alongside wow 1, it'd let them experiment with stuff thatd be too risky for wow 1, like core pillars or w/e
[3:18:46] lastericalive: server stuff is usually what gets hit hard
[3:18:48] Jarlan23: @fizzis_ yea it does. 14 year old is gonna get excited for another patch for a 20 year old game
[3:18:49] Smae: wow graphics are bis imo
[3:18:52] CloudyHS: wow is stylized
[3:18:52] jonpelf: WoWVR when??
[3:18:54] fzybny: Spaghetti code makes it so easy to break stuff
[3:18:54] menzlo: Wow art is good
[3:18:54] Neolithix: give me BG3 level graphics lol
[3:18:55] KaisenSiru: The graphics are perfect
[3:18:56] spiritcheese: RAGEY
[3:18:56] Windnecro: everyone asking for wow 2 didnt learn the lesson from overwatch 2 lol
[3:18:58] turtleulty: graphics are subjective and just a cherry on top of gameplay. Should not be a focus tbh\
[3:18:59] hyeheal: non-texture gear and more combat mechanics
[3:18:59] Jazzarus_: I like WoW's graphics, FF looks like dogshit
[3:19:00] JustJoshin____: the graphics are fine
[3:19:03] Jarlan23: @fizzis_ isnt*
[3:19:10] NickFPV: they should reduce raid size to help with FPS.
[3:19:10] biglonelytv: i cant play games that are too old tbh
[3:19:11] big_boy_on_ripstick: WoW's artstyle is why i liked it
[3:19:12] Azikielboi: wow cant have character animations on big bosses very well @Maximum like showing mechanics via animations rather than UI
[3:19:17] pflipz: I think the two reasons for wow 2 is new engine and potentially new people trying wow
[3:19:18] numnumss: i wish they just update skyboxes, and remake nightborne to the suramar version
[3:19:18] Zaisx: I think WoW looks great
[3:19:19] FroTheBeard: WoW graphics are fine, its just that performance sucks at certain points during raids. Mainly when lots of damage events happen at once. Aka Tswift root/treant overlaps
[3:19:19] auby6: its more about frame rate stability than looks
[3:19:20] xBupa: people still love runescape and those graphics sucks but it doesnt matter lol
[3:19:23] scrimm77: bro i still play ocarina of time and thats from the 90s on n64
[3:19:24] gwenmh: wow style with cloth physics and dye channels would go so hard though
[3:19:25] Jazzarus_: every game with anime style is usually dogshit, and I own manga, so...
[3:19:25] WolfgangAmpersand: WoW has an artstyle that is good. Maybe just more poly added to game.
[3:19:26] berchberkins: imo the less intensive the graphics are, the better in a lot of cases cause it makes it more accesible
[3:19:28] Scargon231: the people who really want great graphics likely aren't playing wow anyway
[3:19:30] Manashi_Mg: proper management of z axis, precision in vehicle control, there's a lot of stuff where WoW engine sucks
[3:19:30] TheItalianStallion321: i have a close friend who REFUSES to play WoW b/c of the graphics. he says FF14 graphics are far superior and hed rather play that
[3:19:32] JustJoshin____: yea graphics are not even close to the most important thing in a game
[3:19:34] beepbeepimadog: art style is way more important than graphical fidelity
[3:19:38] TeamLiquid: Interested in purchasing a Mythic Amirdrassil, the Dreams Hope boost with Team Liquid? Head over to go.adv.gg/4XuCPI for pricing and to schedule a run! (Gold Only)
[3:19:39] Oracle_WoW: @GooseComics things get updated
[3:19:42] CloudyHS: KEKW
[3:19:46] Moai: BDO
[3:19:47] rudejerk: The only thing I want out of wow's graphics right now is more visual clarity and that's entirely on the design team making choices rather than some engine constraints
[3:19:48] LionButLeon: WICKED
[3:19:49] Azikielboi: its not the prettiness its the ability to show mechanics via the graphics rather than UI
[3:19:52] Thecustomdude: the biggest issue in Wow is the player perspective, if you don't play the "best spec" it is harder to be invited.
[3:19:52] mozerra: wow matrix pog
[3:19:54] Sover31gn: How much better can it look before it stops being wow artstyle
[3:19:54] auby6: wow skyrim
[3:19:56] GooseComics: @Oracle_WoW riihgt, but the fact remains, its  still a 20 year old engine
[3:19:56] fizzis_: yeah go play something else YEP
[3:19:57] rudejerk: Not everything has to be the same color as the floor of the room you're in
[3:19:57] menzlo: What engine is riot mmo
[3:20:01] Zivrum: Wow gameplay looking like original wow cinematics
[3:20:05] gwenmh: wow but the actual game looks like the in engine cutscenes
[3:20:06] mfalc: yo whats reptar looking at
[3:20:23] CloudyHS: ur friend is a loser
[3:20:23] fizzis_: @menzlo what riot mmo? didnt they fire all their staff KEKW
[3:20:24] KaisenSiru: HUH
[3:20:26] Harai_Ulfsark: @GooseComics its not, you think the original warcraft 3 engine would allow dragonriding? dafuk
[3:20:26] NickFPV: 10 man raiding pls 😮‍💨
[3:20:27] menzlo: Ff graphics look bad
[3:20:28] spiritcheese: frag
[3:20:31] Jazzarus_: L take, FF looks like doooooooogshit
[3:20:32] SleepyPac: yeah thats L take
[3:20:32] auby6: id rather a solo wow game similar to elder scrolls games
[3:20:33] numnumss: ff14 graphics are a complete turn off for me!
[3:20:33] biglonelytv: garf
[3:20:38] RoboMaximillion: it’s all subjective
[3:20:40] lastericalive: mechanics visuals is just a designer choice. they can (and have) done better/worse
[3:20:40] Ruinx81: Wow kinda has timeless graphics due to the style
[3:20:45] m_dep: I wish people would stop conflating art style with graphics quality
[3:20:49] antipheonixna: its the ui thats bad in ff14 imo
[3:20:52] SillySmiffy: FF has adult mods >.>
[3:20:53] GooseComics: @Harai_Ulfsark Hence MODFIED and constantly updated. good lord
[3:20:55] JustJoshin____: playing a game for graphics only is so strange to me. go look at art you nerd
[3:20:56] KaptinKazual: AGAIN though... The FPS issue is in LARGE part a result of the legacy game code and the sheer volume of code they have heaped on in this engine.  Its similar to why you restart your PC sometimes.. As processes build up, your PC starts to slow a bit.
[3:20:57] racks22: just dont zoom in in FF
[3:21:01] zerossussy: minecraft is a prime example of
[3:21:01] MrChaCho: I think game have to balance graphics with gameplay. like gameplay definitely more important, but the graphics can't be lagging SO far behind. There's few things I've thought the graphics lagged behind the game, mostly Pokemon games, lmao.
[3:21:02] fizzis_: Ill say FF14 does have much better mechanic visuals
[3:21:02] DrQuackzalver: what do you mean, my preference are clearly objective Clueless
[3:21:03] Grissu_: ff14 graphics looks kinda empty, and I don't like the lightning
[3:21:08] Guffels: who tf cares as long as the game play is good. we used to play nes games for god sake
[3:21:17] cookie2505: not about graphics but how all the background works. like your M tindral beginning but not being broken
[3:21:20] Azikielboi: xdd
[3:21:22] Guko97: vanila wow graphics still looks fine in my eyes
[3:21:24] callmetedddd: Max guild wars 2 has race to world first with the boss that got released, check teapot tomorrow if you are interested
[3:21:29] Harai_Ulfsark: @GooseComics im agreeing with you
[3:21:31] gwenmh: snapshotting is super scuffed yep
[3:21:31] Glittches: And higher difficulties doesn't even really show telegraphs in 14
[3:21:33] Jazzarus_: @m_dep ok, FF style is dogshit compared to WoW's
[3:21:37] fzybny: FF14 has horrible net code
[3:21:53] d2jayden: there is a reason why a bunch of people use reshade for ff14
[3:21:58] Lirnril: ff14 main graphics advantage is how many hard they go on transmog options, let alone dye
[3:22:03] Coriollis: both wow and ff have + and - to their style, is ok to enjoy one of them or both :)
[3:22:07] NiteOwl11617: honestly, I think WoW graphics are mostly fine except for pants and trees
[3:22:16] Azikielboi: it seems very hard for them to make boss animations with their engine
[3:22:26] GooseComics: @NiteOwl11617 Don't wear pants. EZ :D
[3:22:29] JustJoshin____: @NiteOwl11617 god the pants are bad lol
[3:22:31] KaptinKazual: I can tell you FF14 uses 4 times the amount of network data that WoW does.  I can see the difference when I use my laptop and am on my Hotspot (which is capped at 10g)
[3:22:34] DuransHybrid: wildstar combat was awesome, RIP
[3:22:37] Zarroe: PepeLaugh advisor melandrus
[3:22:40] NotVacross: wow swirlies....
[3:22:54] gwenmh: wow this, ff that i am a 2XKO main next year
[3:22:54] Strudel115: last boss in rise swirls
[3:23:01] Boreall: I've never played, and I'm not some tribal weirdo, but everyone I've ever seen play FF14 it always looked like 2004 WoW graphics. Is that not the case? It's always looked really fuzzy and older to me. Maybe a better comparison is Dragon Age: Origins
[3:23:02] Azikielboi: its not the floor stuff or the stuff over player heads even (wow can do odin runes) but ff14s bosses can do way flashier shit to indicate which mechanics its doing @Maximum
[3:23:03] Paleee_: @Maximum do you think hero talents can be balanced in a way that the choice is as small as choosing a race?
[3:23:14] Blut103: @gwenmh preach
[3:23:16] valarbravoosi: oh no not network traffic, that game gonna be gone in Korea monkaS
[3:23:17] GooseComics: @gwenmh still a fucking stupid ass name. I can't wait to play it though lol
[3:23:21] Elseworldz: @gwenmh I promise you nobody knows what that is.
[3:23:23] Ristvakbaen1911: We all know the true top MMO is Old School Runescape
[3:23:40] GooseComics: @Elseworldz And you're wrong
[3:23:41] Rilix: final fantasy looks like a worse Tera
[3:23:46] zenkodac: also newer stuff always looks better
[3:23:57] Lirnril: someone's hat in ff14 is gonna have more polygons than your entire vanilla wow party
[3:24:01] numnumss: i love wow artstyle, makes the game look better longer imo
[3:24:02] GodKingMuninn: FF14 graphics are more akin to Skyrim in quality
[3:24:03] zerossussy: final fantasy graphics look like a mobile game thats why
[3:24:12] numnumss: unless your nightborne then you loo klike shit
[3:24:12] WolfgangAmpersand: The first few story zone for FF14 are older than recent expac.
[3:24:15] OG_Kawngi: thurs
[3:24:17] Caseman984: Thursday
[3:24:18] zenkodac: 2 days
[3:24:18] GooseComics: Thursday!
[3:24:19] NiteOwl11617: did we already talk hero talents?
[3:24:19] Squats3: yar
[3:24:22] Goodnevi1: 2 days
[3:24:22] MagmaScythe: yeah
[3:24:22] TheItalianStallion321: thursday
[3:24:23] Caseman984: I took PTO to play it
[3:24:24] Squats3: it looks good
[3:24:24] GodKingMuninn: Oh fucking great, tornado watch in chicago in the dead of fucking winter
[3:24:25] smolderdaddyuwu: Kingdoms hearts style shit
[3:24:26] Blut103: yep
[3:24:30] RoboMaximillion: tomorrow at midnight
[3:24:31] Karkesis: midnight tomorrow depending on where you live
[3:24:31] NotVacross: wow's graphics are not great, but they use the artstyle in a way that makes it really not matter.  For example, look at the hills in pandaria.  its all stretched textures, but it looks like watercolor paintings
[3:24:35] Ruinx81: ff7 remake was so bloated and linear I won't play this one
[3:24:35] Coriollis: tiffa swimsuit Looking
[3:24:36] GooseComics: Rebirth is going to make BANK!
[3:24:40] Thecustomdude: Iprefer wow than ff14 not for the art style, but because wow is more "snappy" than ff14
[3:24:40] Squats3: i couldnt do the remake
[3:24:52] Caseman984: Game is like 100 hours to do everything im excited
[3:24:53] LionButLeon: Sadge
[3:24:54] Hisien: 2 days its sick playing it right now
[3:25:11] Squats3: bruh... if you dont play that on stream ill never see the game
[3:25:11] auby6: I want a solo wow game similar to elderscrolls games, but not to replace retail wow only to exist beside it to play with small group of friends @Maximum
[3:25:19] Hisien: they dont do that this time
[3:25:20] zenkodac: isnt the game offline?
[3:25:23] Boreall: Did you ever end up playing BG3?
[3:25:24] Goodnevi1: There was a demo, I don't think its early access
[3:25:25] Theliahh: streamers Madge
[3:25:27] Blurstinger: Delete tab target, update the graphics, start from vanilla, make wow 2 already...
[3:25:29] d0mezg4mer: what if you're the one who gets it a day early?
[3:25:32] flywinget: play something ahhhhhhhhhh
[3:25:35] Squats3: lol
[3:25:37] fizzis_: KEKW RIOT MMO WEN
[3:25:37] LionButLeon: xdd
[3:25:40] numnumss: starcraft in helldivers style?
[3:25:41] GooseComics: @Maximum Know that some streamers DID get the game early, but they have to wait to play it when the game is officially released
[3:25:44] cookie2505: I didn’t mean graphics I more meant the mechanics for new engine. like you get to M tindral and it’s not broken
[3:25:47] Evan_Ralston: Isn't that all the WoW Alpha's?
[3:25:59] gwenmh: diablo 4 was going to be a souls like...
[3:26:01] FraggyP: do not delete tab targeting lmao please stop yapping 🤣
[3:26:05] notLaund: @Blurstinger whats wrong with tab target?
[3:26:09] Boreall: Drops limited to specific streamers are big bad
[3:26:11] GooseComics: @Evan_Ralston Alphas are not the same as release.
[3:26:11] Faraday5001: a warcraft soulslike would slap
[3:26:18] Karkesis: true
[3:26:21] JoaEUW: We talked about the expanse on a stream some couple weeks ago and i tried the first season and it wasnt really my type of sci-fi. Anyone know a sci-fi series that is more like "the unknown alien kind of thing" and not like star wars sort of sci fi
[3:26:22] Karkesis: o7
[3:26:29] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite devoNOTE
[3:26:30] TehWongWay: campaign against paying extra to play 3 days early
[3:26:33] Kemplore: wow is doing that. hate it
[3:26:33] antipheonixna: max ur gonna get wow alpha before everyone else tho :P
[3:26:36] GooseComics: The Expanse is fucking amazing
[3:26:38] castlecastles: what if you get special access tho?
[3:26:47] Raggu2: Bsg
[3:26:48] menzlo: Star wars?
[3:26:51] maddi_: 3 body problem?
[3:26:52] mfalc: foundation is pog
[3:26:52] GodKingMuninn: Lost in Space
[3:26:56] lonelyknight1922: Battlestar Galactica
[3:26:57] Goodnevi1: Star Trek
[3:27:01] Tanonn: i like the expanse a lot
[3:27:02] GabMoon__: Arrival
[3:27:02] TheTacoSalad: the new appletv one is pretty good
[3:27:04] pendragon925: stargate maybe?
[3:27:04] ajzamo: Getting into the books now and I adore
[3:27:05] WrathofBambi: Expanse is the unknown alien kind of thing
[3:27:05] pnguinwow: i watched foundation and that shit slapped holy moly
[3:27:10] Gwedo18: as not a Streamer i dont mind if streamers get it a day early becuase its saved me a lot of money seeing it before i buy it becuase i didnt like after watching XYZ steeams on it
[3:27:12] Coriollis: BSG+
[3:27:12] MarkusGrimes: ehh Id say that having a streamer play a game a day early can be helpful for a viewer if they are on the fence on getting the game. watching someone else can help them decide
[3:27:14] GooseComics: @Raggu2 So Say We All!
[3:27:14] racks22: im watching you
[3:27:15] Nekrans: PLaying Balatro and listening
[3:27:15] ezlol: i wasnt watching kek
[3:27:16] BigKove: edging
[3:27:20] jandemain: it's a second monitor show
[3:27:20] zerossussy: i like Silo sc-fi show but theres no aliens involved
[3:27:24] JoaEUW: Anyone watched Arrival? Something like that
[3:27:26] Raggu2: Im watching someone else listening here
[3:27:28] Lrauq: GIGACHAD balatromaxxers
[3:27:28] BLACKFOOT_TN: Im poddyC you right now. Playin 2042
[3:27:29] toastbam: for us all
[3:27:30] noxin_htx: I've heard amazing reviews on shogun
[3:27:33] sethomatic: SG-1 represent!
[3:27:34] FroTheBeard: Listening while I spread democracy across the galaxy
[3:27:36] surfazing_: im fully watching Sadge
[3:27:41] Rhop: I'm watching Stare
[3:27:42] Zzekar: sadge that didnt continued with last seasons..
[3:27:43] toastbam: for all mankind
[3:27:44] toastbam: is good
[3:27:49] BlueSuedeSpeedo: @Maximum i always put on your stream when i don't want to pay attention to a stream
[3:27:53] BLACKFOOT_TN: SG1 was legit though
[3:27:55] cookie2505: I didn’t mean graphics I more meant the mechanics for new engine. like you get to M tindral and it’s not broken
[3:27:56] Scargon231: but it's still helpful the day it comes out
[3:27:58] zerossussy: a day before is cooked
[3:27:59] Lirnril: you could also just wait a day before buying it lol
[3:27:59] Blurstinger: @notLaund It's outdated, has been implemented for a long time, and is boring. Due to the tab target, there are still chances of HIT and MISS. I prefer to aim my abilities myself rather than leaving it to the mercy of a programming system
[3:28:00] fzybny: If we're going on TV, that new show Shogun is a banger.
[3:28:07] Coriollis: @zerossussy they kinda ripped concepts from fallout
[3:28:09] pjcurtin: yeah but you dont have to buy the game the day it comes out
[3:28:15] Squats3: welcome to the rest of us
[3:28:17] iloveuminkey: ThankEgg ThankEgg
[3:28:22] Blut103: geezer KEKW
[3:28:32] TheItalianStallion321: but what does a game being releases early 1 day going to decice whether you want it or not? it will be gone the day after?
[3:28:36] Theliahh: based and true
[3:28:36] Squats3: @Maximum ya boy shroud is the #1 offender
[3:28:37] GrimmshadoXI: @MarkusGrimes Not really. You can buy games after day 1 you know. So just watch the stream on day 1-2 and then buy them if you want to
[3:28:38] Raggu2: @GooseComics ive not seen more than part of season 1. I predicted the twist ending, found out I was correct, though it was pointless to watch the whole thing (bsg)
[3:28:39] Rhop: There was some umph in the G of that "Geezer"
[3:28:45] zerossussy: @coriollis idk, its based off of a book afaik
[3:29:04] sheenayy: @Maximum does your beard ever bother you
[3:29:05] Souffy: here comes the yapper
[3:29:07] GooseComics: @Raggu2 Give it a shot. Sure knowing the end is meh, but honestly BSG is top tier stuff
[3:29:13] Team_Spanky: Team_Spanky subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! There's your god damn monthly prime sub. Thanks for the entertaining and good content jabroni!
[3:29:20] edangus23: artificial fomo
[3:29:25] Austuhnnn: I think the 100 on netflix is the same its a good show to have on your other monitor
[3:29:26] GooseComics: No. Its a brand new game
[3:29:27] Caseman984: The demo is thew first chapter, prog saves
[3:29:29] TheItalianStallion321: stand alone
[3:29:29] Gingeranajones: STANDALONE
[3:29:30] Raggu2: No, fresh start.
[3:29:32] nanerpus_: stand alone, bonuses if you have a save
[3:29:33] OG_Kawngi: separate but demo prog carries over
[3:29:39] mattymedz: @Maximum can you move the on screen chat overslightly? it cuts off at  the end
[3:29:40] Squats3: thats kinda.. interesting..
[3:29:42] Rilix: its like you were born, but then you crawl back in and do it again
[3:29:43] MarkusGrimes: @GrimmshadoXI ya they can but some games have launch day deals and stuff.  for the most part your right.
[3:29:46] OG_Kawngi: yes
[3:29:46] nanerpus_: yes
[3:29:50] Caseman984: ps5 only, pc eventually
[3:29:51] GooseComics: PS5 only for now. 3 month exclusive
[3:29:56] Gummy4907: New game continuing from remake
[3:30:18] GooseComics: Progress is saved from the demo is true, but not from Remake. @Maximum
[3:30:21] Squats3: w-what
[3:30:22] zerossussy: i hate ps5 only games they are worse than pre 1 day release games to streamers
[3:30:22] rudejerk: There's apparently a 4 minute video that recaps the story
[3:30:23] sorliee: classic max not remembering story
[3:30:25] Squats3: WHAT
[3:30:26] rudejerk: that's pretty good
[3:30:27] antipheonixna: D:
[3:30:29] naztldr: Take DAT BK!
[3:30:30] rudejerk: according to reviews
[3:30:35] zmathias71: stop
[3:30:38] zmathias71: story op
[3:30:43] Squats3: but this game has more tifa
[3:30:45] paper_rose: @Maximum any more last epoch?
[3:30:49] its_blando: cutscene skipper noooo
[3:30:50] cookie2505: I didn’t mean graphics I more meant the mechanics for new engine. like you get to M tindral and it’s not broken
[3:30:56] Theliahh: Madge
[3:31:11] GooseComics: Strimmer doesn't lik same ting i do. I"M MADGE
[3:31:11] ghostdog_xd: have you seen tokyo vice?
[3:31:22] Coriollis: yeah story needs time to breathe
[3:31:26] JoaEUW: Some series are made off video games
[3:31:30] felmaden: have u played rdr2
[3:31:36] fallb4me: I feel the same way about books vs tv
[3:31:41] Team_Spanky: @Maximum  You going to be watching Shogun on Hulu? It looks amazing. And the original was really well done.
[3:31:51] AkuTVgg: max. ever seen the show The Blacklist w/ James Spader?  banger show
[3:31:51] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121355 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_maximum #ad
[3:31:53] zerossussy: rdr2 story was great
[3:31:55] Theliahh: so true
[3:31:59] RoloDB: baldurs gate did pretty well i think
[3:32:00] JoaEUW: ARCANE SEASON 2 THO
[3:32:03] gdcotton: did we already talk warrior stuff?
[3:32:05] RoloDB: Rare case
[3:32:13] scrapps1: @zerossussy outrageously good take
[3:32:16] GooseComics: Halo TV show vs Halo game......
[3:32:18] Arthasnokkov: i think the story in the game was amazing. as my brother described it, last of us was the "best movie he ever played"
[3:32:22] Ruinx81: Did I miss your react to that raiders post?
[3:32:39] highcard2: i get your point, if someone is a really really good writer and theyre great at crafting stories, they don't write for videogames they write books or tv or movies
[3:32:39] GooseComics: @Ruinx81 he didn't do it
[3:32:40] Keppie__: it went on a bit to long
[3:32:40] spinachdipminiatures: I think with BG3 the amount of variability and diverging story lines you can take makes it one of the exceptions where a game would tell the story miles better than a show/movie
[3:32:42] gdcotton: Blacklist is an amazing before bed show lol
[3:32:44] Slapsstick: A games ability to tell the story comes from the the players ability to be immersed. A show you can just watch and get most of the experience
[3:32:50] d2jayden: its pretty close if you pay attention to the game like the show
[3:32:55] clazuls: yeah blacklist is a fall asleep slow
[3:32:56] antipheonixna: james spader is just a treat to watch in it
[3:32:57] clazuls: show
[3:33:01] Jesdawow: blacklist ending was the worst thing ever
[3:33:02] Speed_Stick: @Maximum  what kind of dog is that!?
[3:33:03] wow_bubbletea: wow_bubbletea subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 35 month streak! 35 months sheesh
[3:33:06] Ruinx81: Reacher good before bed show. Stupid story but entertaingin
[3:33:06] Thatsabann: u gonna check out Shogun
[3:33:09] gdcotton: Blacklist and NCIS are prime before bed show to knock out too
[3:33:11] Slapsstick: @Speed_Stick horse
[3:33:13] antipheonixna: persons of interest though that banged hard
[3:33:13] Raggu2: Who is James spader?
[3:33:16] Thecustomdude: Best shows i've seen, is band of brothers and chernobyl.
[3:33:27] Speed_Stick: da big one O.o
[3:33:28] slappadabas5: Check out Loudermilk if you haven't
[3:33:38] druidiful: i remember having watch parties for 24. the jack bauer power hour!
[3:33:40] paper_rose: when did u get reptar?
[3:33:43] Lindorn_: reptar just yoinked her spot
[3:33:47] TheItalianStallion321: Reppy T just snuggled with Lilly
[3:33:51] paragorr: chernobyl was so good
[3:33:54] holyrs: true detective season 1
[3:33:55] ktthemage: @jbutters84 Good but slow
[3:33:55] numnumss: favorite show of all time, bojack horseman
[3:33:56] BigTrout3: if i could stretch like a dog or cat, i'd be invincible
[3:33:56] maddi_: LUL
[3:34:05] gloomygl: My favorite show is Oz
[3:34:06] toastbam: cher nobel
[3:34:07] JoaEUW: But honestly why is the best tv shows ever made on HBO

[3:34:12] zerossussy: chernobyl top tier
[3:34:20] animosis23: Dude...Band of Brothers.  That's all.
[3:34:26] torrent29: Midnight Mass was probably one of the best shows I had ever watched - along with the other Haunting shows on Netflix

[3:34:36] noxin_htx: The first season of true detective is one of the best things of all time
[3:34:37] ValThePal: i dont think people are "watching the show" while doing something else meanwhile. i think to actually watch something you really have to give it your full attention

[3:35:57] mattymedz: @Maximum can you move the chat layover over a bit its cut off at the end
[3:36:00] maddi_: I think one of the biggest things about shows is having a good end to it and I think most shows just go until the viewership drops which means it gets worse before it ends so bad memories towards the end. see house and many others
[3:36:02] edangus23: Warrior on max slapped
[3:36:11] KraigLooney: did they know it was your name and did you sue for IP infringement?
