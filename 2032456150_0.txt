[0:05:24] morphexia: Nice wig! Reminds me of shadowlands time

[0:05:31] amaya21: amazing color!!
[0:05:31] Ama_ryilis: looks so good!
[0:05:31] coffeegremlinofdoom: What a cute cat
[0:05:32] fisherreads: Morticia Addams could never
[0:05:41] anne42: Very dramatic
[0:05:43] Cyberwolffe: I like it, but had to laugh at the way you were talking at first
[0:05:45] vharakh_17: void elf cosplay coming up
[0:05:53] amaya21: it suits you so much!! <3
[0:06:13] sence_00: awwww purple wig <3
[0:06:20] Kurama__95: There are a lot of mission table parts, unfortunately
[0:06:42] Zuldak: So last night I decided to go fishing and I got a broken wine bottle mog!
[0:06:49] Zuldak: It's a one handed mace
[0:06:50] cashthb: I like the color but it is really long for sure
[0:06:51] Cyberwolffe: I got my hunter class mounts yesterday, trying to decide what one I want to do next.
[0:07:05] russtrotter: are your neck muscles in shape from lifting light with the buzz?
[0:07:15] Daemavand: Ooh! Nice color and nice style!
[0:07:28] witchhobbit: hi!!!! ooooh this is the mystery wig? love it!
[0:07:29] fisherreads: I think with pally I got enough from order hall quests
[0:07:30] russtrotter: long hair seems so ... heavy?
[0:07:45] Octopixy1971: Hai miss kira, such a sweetie hazelShiny hazelTen
[0:07:47] diarrhea_lad: hello hello! happy sunday! I got KSH for the first time last night, feeling pretty good
[0:07:48] wolfcloudchaser80: It's almost hippie-adjacent!
[0:08:02] h3artcr4sh: new hair looks amazing :O <3
[0:08:02] CompanyDysprosium: Your character is looking fly as hell
[0:08:30] wolfcloudchaser80: Can confirm, hair can be heavy. When I cut off a 13+ inch ponytail, the difference was surprising.
[0:08:44] Zuldak: falling star is related suramar
[0:08:51] Zuldak: not class order hall
[0:09:09] fisherreads: I think you have to do it for certain classes order hall campaign
[0:09:09] sence_00: i think you probably need to leave and come back for a few moments
[0:09:42] sence_00: oh maybe Priest and Pally it was mandatory
[0:09:57] dvkJoe: TAKE THAT
[0:10:15] mcxoney: you will need to unlock the nightborne disguise coz later on you will need to buy something from vendors in suramar in order to unlock class hall mount
[0:10:44] Zuldak: contemplation is an ability
[0:10:49] Zuldak: it does like an emote thingy
[0:11:15] dvkJoe: Do the Champions of Legionfall and see if you get Worthy the title or Preperations underway
[0:11:22] GreenArrowed: slowly. it's so cold again.
[0:11:23] gertrudean: Hey there Hazel!

[0:12:57] Daemavand: Yeah I can imagine! Sounds like yuo've put thought into it though and are trying things, which is good
[0:13:02] Cyberwolffe: It's -10F here with -25F wind chill so trying to stay warm and not going out of the house until I need to go to work tomorrow
[0:13:06] The_FinnMint: That social battery needs charging!

[0:13:30] Streamlabs: lunarphor just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:13:32] gertrudean: I bought a wig for shits and giggles. Any tips for putting it on?
[0:13:37] Zuldak: our forecast says partial melt and then a refreeze
[0:13:45] Daemavand: Oh that's good, ice is no bueno. I'm not sure I can move my car anytime soon because its on top of a sheet of solid ice from freeze-thaw periods lol
[0:13:46] messoffrex: ugh i love when kitty is on stream >_<
[0:14:13] russtrotter: doughnating
[0:14:16] Daemavand: Sourdough is indeed a commitment. But you are definitely ready. :D
[0:14:22] Cyberwolffe: It's supposed to be back to 40F by the end of the month.  Can't wait
[0:14:56] gertrudean: Tips for a sourdough starter is to use 2 parts water, 1 part flour for first day...then go 1/1. And use whole rye flour to begin with.
[0:14:57] Daemavand: Could you ask your Mom questions if you're unsure? It sounds like she has a lot of experience with it
[0:15:04] adamgs82: A poolish is like a starter, but takes way less time a preperation and yields similar results.
[0:15:19] Zuldak: someday will you grow your own grain to grind into flour?
[0:15:23] wolfcloudchaser80: Better than catching some fish, burying it in the ground, then digging it back up later to eat.
[0:15:33] sence_00: i feel that way about pickling too, since there is no way to really see that its 'worked'
[0:15:35] Hippwn: oh this wig kind of reminds of the long hair you used to have
[0:15:58] fisherreads: I’m always worried about positioning myself with homemade fermented foods
[0:16:05] fisherreads: poisoning
[0:16:12] WhiteU: @HazelNuttyGames are you using a wig?
[0:16:21] WhiteU: just checked your insta
[0:16:26] WhiteU: and you have short hair
[0:16:41] WhiteU: or do you know any magic hair formula? i need ittt
[0:16:43] GreenArrowed: caning is terrifying
[0:16:43] Zuldak: the sour in the sourdough was a warning Kappa
[0:16:44] Vesamora: !wig
[0:16:44] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:16:47] Vesamora: rip
[0:16:49] fallingupwards: Canning really intimidates me
[0:16:51] adamgs82: Fermented foods are very unlikely to harm you. Fermentation will likely kill any pathogens.
[0:16:57] Vesamora: oh it worked
[0:16:58] Arabany: It is not that hard
[0:17:17] Daemavand: I think the main concern is to prevent contamination from undesired microbes, but in terms of sourdough, I suspect you'll know easily if that has occured?
[0:17:24] Daemavand: (I have no experience myself with sourdough)
[0:17:41] Daemavand: Yeah exactly
[0:17:44] runswithwands: Good Morning, all!
[0:17:46] zoomcentral: are there any mount runs your gonna do today?
[0:18:25] Daemavand: Yep! Beer is essentially liquid bread :D
[0:18:28] russtrotter: ha! "hooch" i thought was basically all kinds of homemade alcohol, didn't know it originated in breadmaking
[0:18:34] wolfcloudchaser80: I learned in college that a soda can amount of botulin toxin contains enough lethal doses to kill everyone. Literally every person on earth.
[0:18:57] silverstitcher: silverstitcher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:18:57] Streamlabs: silverstitcher just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:19:07] vharakh_17: is hooch an organic chemistry type of reference? like -ooch?
[0:19:29] ghostie1995: this wig is so pretty! love the color
[0:19:35] russtrotter: @wolfcloudchaser80 dang, that'd be a party buzz kill
[0:19:36] Daemavand: @vharakh_17 As a biochemist, I appreciate this reference lol, but I don't think it is
[0:19:48] Vivica_x0: I love that you can walk to your fmailies house
[0:20:11] gertrudean: Can confirm...takes a long time for your sourdough to get really good.
[0:20:12] mjsage: Ohhhh! This wig is lovely!
[0:20:18] Perkolate: What will you name your starter?
[0:20:25] jeffdmk: does your mom know you killed her starter?
[0:20:33] Daemavand: Name it Bob :D
[0:20:38] Zuldak: Steve the sourdough starter
[0:21:12] adamgs82: My great grand father and grand father had a bakery back in the day. It closed in the 60s and my mom had dried starter at one point, but she has no idea what happened to it. Would be cool to find it and bring it back to life after several decades.
[0:21:17] wolfcloudchaser80: Hm, wonder what we could anagram sourdough starter into for names?
[0:21:18] Daemavand: Dude walkability is such a massive QOL plus that I will never ever take for granted ever again :D
[0:21:21] Hippwn: She would say that's ok honey here is more
[0:21:23] ghostie1995: this reminds me of a pokemon name fidough. hes literally a dog made of BREAD
[0:21:25] averageteacup: @Zuldak good name :D
[0:21:58] gertrudean: Your mom has s starter?  You should definetely use some of hers to make yours...so much easier. Wish I'd had someone donate me some of theirs.
[0:22:03] diarrhea_lad: Scarlet/Violet?
[0:22:06] littlehelle: scarlet/violet
[0:22:06] cashthb: speaking of starters dying, don't poke center costs being too low in gen 5 kill the immersion
[0:22:16] dvkJoe: Can you check if you have quest available on the broken shore called Champions of Legionfall?
[0:22:32] jeffdmk: it is mog and you dont have it
[0:22:38] PGTB: I remember hating this about halfway through legion.
[0:22:50] ghostie1995: can confirm very cute.
[0:22:56] medvet03: For paladins, this quest chain is needed for the class hall campaign.
[0:22:59] Zuldak: the glass canon strategy
[0:23:05] diarrhea_lad: Any game that has Wooper, I *must* include Wooper on my team
[0:23:15] adamgs82: @gertrudean We'd need to find it. It's dried in a jar somewhere and it's been propagated from a culture that would likely be over 100 years old.
[0:23:31] Hippwn: I used to have one attack of each type on my 6 party team
[0:23:32] cashthb: what about slowpoke? btw speed is was more important, you 1 shot anything 3 gymn into the game anyway
[0:23:44] ghostie1995: named the evolution Krispy
[0:24:17] Hippwn: Velen doesn't get a lot of attention but I really like him
[0:24:18] littlehelle: loved violet
[0:24:22] ghostie1995: yes omg!!
[0:24:31] sence_00: Violet felt really bizarre to me too, I couldnt play it
[0:24:47] ghostie1995: it was so hard to keep playing for a while. im now playing the dlc and theyre soo good
[0:25:03] Ryok: that's exactly what they did xD because it had to be out in time for the ash saga finale of the anime
[0:25:38] Zuldak: ive said goodbye to pokemon after sun/moon.
[0:25:39] ghostie1995: i hear gamefreak is just tired of pokemon games but idk how true that is
[0:25:43] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:25:46] cashthb: well it's a japanese developer that made 2d games in like 2014, also switch hardware
[0:25:52] Ryok: it's pokemon... people will buy the game if it literally poops into your switch and steals your credit card information
[0:25:58] macattack557: new hair, who dis
[0:26:01] necr0me0wcer: Hello everyone! <3
[0:26:07] runswithwands: I LOVE that wig! that is so pretty!
[0:26:22] Ryok: @cashthb there's amazing looking games on the switch... like monster hunter rise
[0:26:25] Octopixy1971: @toritelling hazelWave
[0:26:29] sence_00: oh I HATE the battle for exodar lol, have done it way too many times
[0:26:41] Ryok: @cashthb and they run 100 times better than scar/vio xD
[0:26:47] Daemavand: I completely forgot battle for Exodar existed
[0:27:20] Zuldak: there is a skip to open the broken shore
[0:27:33] jeffdmk: is there anything you need behind the extra quest?
[0:27:35] sence_00: I always get there and think "c'mon Velen just let me speak!! dont make me run aro und this is important!"
[0:27:42] cashthb: @Ryok well maybe style wise the texture quality is barely on par with 2008 games
[0:27:48] Zuldak: yes
[0:27:56] GreenArrowed: yes
[0:27:59] necr0me0wcer: yep
[0:28:17] goplacidly56: I like this wig too. My fav is the pink one
[0:28:41] Zuldak: im still happy i got this broken wine bottle mog lol
[0:28:45] Ryok: @cashthb i love to crap on nintendo consoles and their terrible hardware... but this is not a "the console can't run this game" problem ^^ it's a "the developers needed like 6-9 months more development time but the higher ups said ship it NOW" problem xD
[0:28:55] dmorrygan: omg new wig!!!!! ^^
[0:28:56] dvkJoe: Could you please check for a quest on the broken shore called Champions of Legionfall? Should be on the map.
[0:29:01] cashthb: honestly I'd just pass on the mage one
[0:29:02] sence_00: you can do the campaign while you level!
[0:29:18] dvkJoe: Damn
[0:29:39] necr0me0wcer: I missed Legion quests so much, I need to do them again
[0:29:41] sence_00: i LOVE the mage mounts, I use them all the time
[0:30:16] Daemavand: The warrior mount is so massive and hoorah-esque and I kind of love it even if I rarely use it because its so huge lol
[0:30:18] Hippwn: What race will you make your mage! I love mages!
[0:30:20] jeffdmk: are you going to do the extra quest i believe it gives mog
[0:30:50] Daemavand: The nice thing about transmog is its collection is often passive via other activities
[0:30:54] Zuldak: one time Anthus is gonna get on the crusader horse and it's gonna eat him...
[0:31:15] Ryok: my go to race is nightelf for every class that can be one... shadowmeld is too good xD
[0:31:48] Danoria: Vulpera?
[0:31:48] Daemavand: I was gonna say
[0:31:49] picklez919: gnome army!
[0:31:50] sence_00: ya, gnome it up!
[0:31:52] Daemavand: the answer is clearly gnome
[0:31:56] sence_00: Ive given up having one of every race
[0:32:00] Aquanaria97: @Ryok And they are more astheric!
[0:32:03] kynlaeh: gnome mages are amazing with the pointy wizard hats
[0:32:08] gertrudean: I have a boost sitting there, taunting me...don't know what to use it on
[0:32:09] jeffdmk: This wig is amazing
[0:32:14] Daemavand: True! Horde is excellent
[0:32:14] AquastarBlue: nightborne mage for legion!
[0:32:16] wolfcloudchaser80: Vulpera are adorable
[0:32:18] russtrotter: troll cast anims are cool
[0:32:20] Hippwn: Oooo maybe a Nightborne mage
[0:32:24] kynlaeh: tauren mage lol
[0:32:26] Zuldak: nightborn is cool
[0:32:27] GreenArrowed: nightborne make great mages
[0:32:32] Danoria: Vulpera are adorable
[0:32:33] Zuldak: void elf mage
[0:32:35] cashthb: it could also be a mecha gnome!
[0:32:36] Daemavand: Which reminds me, I would like to take my troll paladin through TWing before the end of the week
[0:32:36] mediocrity_squared: vulpra mage?
[0:32:42] Essiandar: the great purge
[0:32:45] eielwind: i made my priest nightborne, pretty cool race
[0:32:47] kynlaeh: i like the female goblin casting animations
[0:32:51] Zuldak: Worgen mage... Kappa
[0:33:05] cashthb: or worgen male, you know you want that casting animation
[0:33:07] Arabany: I love taurens and gnomes too much to make other races, though I kind of wish I had different class-race combination, but alas it is one big herd of taurens:)
[0:33:12] cashthb: @Zuldak great minds think alike
[0:33:14] Daemavand: Ooooh nice! Skari is out of retirement :D How'd you find it?
[0:33:29] russtrotter: taurens doing anything is like a bodybuilder trying to do origami
[0:34:02] necr0me0wcer: I still have allied races' heritage armor to unlock but i don't want to level them. i  just want to have another night elf LUL
[0:34:09] Arabany: @russtrotter haha
[0:34:17] Zuldak: you could have a Pandaran mage too
[0:34:26] jeffdmk: playing that alt more is a solution to that non problem
[0:34:40] Daemavand: I finally stopped being lazy and looked into how to craft 3 pieces of gear for Dae... I was so out of the loop I didn't even know what embellishments were >.>
[0:34:42] cashthb: it's worgin time!
[0:34:46] Hippwn: Void elf mage seems like it might be cool
[0:34:46] 6thbiscuit: You had a Dark Iron fire mage a while back.
[0:34:50] jin_spear: pandas slap tho
[0:34:54] GreenArrowed: every time you mention worgen i just cringe at my own ability to not manage to level one
[0:34:54] sence_00: I cant deal with how disproportionately long Vulpera arms are
[0:34:57] Zuldak: Join team edward and be a worgen
[0:34:59] Essiandar: hiya hazel, i keep hearing some conflicting reports about threads of fate in SL. Wow support says its been removed but people are reporting getting the threads of fate option when they do SL content at max level.
[0:35:32] GreenArrowed: yea that's why i keep trying to level them
[0:35:32] For_Real_Real: im surprised you don't have a worgan to play through the story in 10.2.5 to see how the story is/isn't different.
[0:35:34] Sabrius_: most of my charaacters are worgen just cause darkflight is op
[0:35:36] dergNwolf: Worgen are good snoot boys werenwAwoo
[0:35:36] picklez919: i think the fire mage was a mechagnome?
[0:35:46] cashthb: oh worgen male hunter is amazing with rifles
[0:35:54] Arabany: Dark irons are super cool as well, and they have a mole machine. A dark Iron mage engineer is an ultimate porting machine.
[0:36:08] dgriesemer: It's on worsen now that you can stay human
[0:36:21] sence_00: @Essiandar you can do it if you started before they took it out OR if you start it at max lvl i think. You cant use it to lvl
[0:36:21] Kurama__95: @For_Real_Real Is the questline worgen only? Thought it'd be like the Lordaeron one where anyone can do it
[0:36:24] dgriesemer: It's nice
[0:36:27] Hippwn: Threads of fate does still exist HOWEVER you have to be level 60 to use it!
[0:36:29] bayneeon: Threads of fate does not get offered to a character until you are level 60. Bit late by that point
[0:36:45] necr0me0wcer: Void elf?
[0:36:53] dergNwolf: dragonflight also didn't do much to deserve not having its cutscenes skipped, sadly
[0:36:58] dergNwolf: tippiThink
[0:36:59] cashthb: what about a male gnome?
[0:37:03] Capau: use the class generator until you hit a mage
[0:37:06] eielwind: this scenario IS long wow lol
[0:37:10] kynlaeh: you could do a female Draenei mage, they’re pretty cool
[0:37:17] GreenArrowed: boy?
[0:37:18] GreenArrowed: yea
[0:37:33] GreenArrowed: i was scared, i thought he met his end or something
[0:37:50] For_Real_Real: @Kurama__95 Its supposed to be open and free for everyone to go through.  but a lot of ppl online are expecting the story to be different if you play a worgen versus not.   Because its "your" home.
[0:37:53] wolfcloudchaser80: Ooo, male red eredar mage? You should see my warlock that I made that way.
[0:37:59] Zuldak: i have a druid of every race because i am insane
[0:38:04] dergNwolf: then you get your worgen hunter phillieY
[0:38:18] cashthb: on one hand, it's gotta be a worgen, on the other hand why are talking this much about the race of a mage that won't exist for weeks 'cause they have the lamest mount
[0:38:20] Arabany: There is a streamer she has every race every class combination:)
[0:38:29] russtrotter: but not all races can be druids tho right? e.g. humans
[0:38:33] dergNwolf: oh male worgen are superior but I have a SLIGHT feeling I'm biased
[0:38:33] Hippwn: I like my male worgen rogue seems fitting for him
[0:38:39] Arabany: yes, 7 or 8 accounts
[0:38:56] eielwind: is the char limit per server or per acct?
[0:39:03] traktordestrucktor: all I want is one tiny thing, undead  palladins
[0:39:29] traktordestrucktor: True!
[0:39:38] GreenArrowed: i would finally make an undead if they let me make a pally
[0:39:39] Elrathir: Elrathir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! I want an even tinier thing, mechagnome paladins!!
[0:39:39] Streamlabs: elrathir just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:39:41] traktordestrucktor: Tauren DH?
[0:39:44] cashthb: male worgen has the: -worst casting animation; - worst armor fit; - worst voice lines; they are the best
[0:39:44] Zuldak: they have eredar paladins now
[0:39:54] messoffrex: id love a nightborne demon hunters :(
[0:39:56] averageteacup: I'm waiting for War Within just to collect transmog on my BM hunter
[0:40:02] russtrotter: until blizz stops gatekeeping content behind reps, i'll take humans for everything
[0:40:05] necroticlolxd: mechanome druids
[0:40:06] dergNwolf: I'm against hypocritical because I would refuse opening up Evokers and Druids but I very badly want non-elf options for DH
[0:40:08] bayneeon: There is only one race / class i truely want. Gnome Druid
[0:40:12] TheBenXO: Ever since they made Tauren rogues, there should be no restriction for class race combos
[0:40:14] dergNwolf: *I'm hypocritical
[0:40:15] necroticlolxd: i wanna shapeshift into a robot bear

[0:40:27] sence_00: I dont see why Draenei and Orcs cant be DH
[0:40:29] zlinda95: Wooow love the hair!
[0:40:31] Arabany: She does not really play them, as far as I understand, she levels them up to maximum and then she keep only one or two accounts active all the time.
[0:40:35] hPeaches: love that!
[0:40:40] dergNwolf: @toritelling yeeee
[0:40:48] wolfcloudchaser80: The idea of restricting classes by race always struck me like saying "Canadian's can't be engineers, that's absurd!"
[0:40:54] dmorrygan: Demon hunters should be expanded to all elves tbh :( imagine a Void elf and a glyph to color the spells void-y
[0:41:09] Arabany: I'm still waiting for a gnome and pandaren druids and paladins
[0:41:15] cashthb: @wolfcloudchaser80 name 1 canadian engineer
[0:41:27] Hippwn: or they could make the gnome druid forms huge just to be funny
[0:41:49] Zuldak: had a 485 DH join my 2 key. They did 170k dps :O
[0:42:15] jodianneee: i'm doing that at 455 on my DH lol
[0:42:15] Zuldak: yes overall. we were pulling big
[0:42:24] wolfcloudchaser80: Chris Hadfield is a Canadian engineer. And Astronaut.
[0:42:25] cashthb: maybe gnome dhs should use an elf mech

[0:45:14] Daemavand: do you remember mood rings?
[0:45:26] Daemavand: That change color depending on your "mood"
[0:45:30] Daemavand: Imagine if you could have a wig like that lol
[0:45:39] Arabany: I wish we still had old quest lines available, I really dislike the fact that Blizzards remove them form the game.
[0:45:40] GreenArrowed: yes same
[0:45:45] zlinda95: What's the plan today?
[0:45:47] exalted1715: Sashay Left!

[0:46:14] Zuldak: oh you could have chat integration and they could vote on hair color :P
[0:46:18] traktordestrucktor: You should get a wig of evry gnome hairstyle option
[0:46:21] jeffdmk: how much does it suck when you get to tier 6 on then get no reasonable lines over many turns and everyone out scales you?
[0:46:40] sence_00: have the colour change based on volume o
[0:46:53] GreenArrowed: ooooo
[0:46:57] GreenArrowed: my favorite scene
[0:46:58] unfinanciallystable: THAT would be awesome!

[0:47:18] runswithwands: Look, I'm using channel points!
[0:47:21] GreenArrowed: yesss
[0:47:29] GreenArrowed: i think it's my favorite disney movie as an adult
[0:47:36] GreenArrowed: it's not so sad i cry through the whole thing
[0:47:54] GreenArrowed: and i haven't changed my mind about it since i've grown up, like with the little mermaid.
[0:47:58] jeffdmk: I wonder if i can get to 1 million channel points this year
[0:47:59] Daemavand: The first 8 minutes of Up.
[0:48:01] Vesamora: Oh I still say lines from that baking scene in my head when I cook
[0:48:04] Daemavand: I can't.
[0:48:16] GreenArrowed: @Daemavand actual trauma

[0:48:26] jakefx1: I ball at that one, and Up!
[0:48:27] Zuldak: for me its the beginning of up
[0:48:31] ghostie1995: same, also the movie Coco
[0:48:35] sence_00: Louisa's song kills me
[0:48:44] turbo_queenhm: Coco for sure
[0:48:48] diarrhea_lad: I tear up at the end of Finding Nemo
[0:48:49] turbo_queenhm: Ugly sobbing
[0:49:09] Daemavand: Coco is incredibly heartwarming but it didn't make me cry
[0:49:10] turbo_queenhm: Makes me miss my Nonna
[0:49:16] Essiandar: why didnt the silver hand just hang up the chandelier?
[0:49:16] sence_00: oh ya I watched Coco on a flight and was so embarrassed at how much i was crying
[0:49:23] Fulcrum126: Luca had me crying
[0:49:27] Marovia: under preassure is a banger 󠀀
[0:49:39] unfinanciallystable: can you use class order hall mounts on all classes?
[0:49:45] Daemavand: Parts of Wall-E broke me up though, surprisingly, when Wall-E and EVE were being really sweet to each other
[0:49:46] runswithwands: Need more CHAMPYUNS
[0:49:58] diarrhea_lad: oh, and I *definitely* cried curing Toy Story 3. It lined up perfectly with me going to college
[0:50:10] m4keyourself: I cried immediately on the last episode of wheel of time when one of the animals died.. no spoilers but it was such a surprise crying happened immediately lol
[0:50:11] turbo_queenhm: I haven't seen Luca and I'm afraid to because it'll definitely remind me of my Nonna
[0:50:14] m4keyourself: because dog lover
[0:50:41] wolfcloudchaser80: It's 59F/15C in my house right now. It's possible the heaters aren't quite keeping up.
[0:50:44] jeffdmk: mage
[0:50:46] diarrhea_lad: my name is Luca and when that movie came out my little nieces asked me if I was a sea monster
[0:50:52] sence_00: the warlock story is pretty fantastic
[0:50:55] dmorrygan: Warlock has 3 !
[0:50:59] Zuldak: the warlock one has a mount thatys a rare drop
[0:51:00] MagicalPurs3: Do you have a favorite and least favorite mount? Or least fav/fav campaign?
[0:51:05] necr0me0wcer: do you have hunter's?
[0:51:07] traktordestrucktor: druid have no mount
[0:51:10] necr0me0wcer: oh
[0:51:16] sence_00: you could check and see if Druid is already up for you on Broken Shore
[0:51:24] diarrhea_lad: Shaman is a pretty good mount
[0:51:27] istsoft: i hope blizz will bring back that awesome pigamas to trading post or any else
[0:51:55] Daemavand: Aye keep at it! You've had good momentum
[0:53:05] diarrhea_lad: is it Mage that has the disks that change based on spec?
[0:53:17] necr0me0wcer: I wish we'd have more raven mounts
[0:53:24] sence_00: @diarrhea_lad ya
[0:53:35] Lunarphor: could check for the title
[0:53:44] eielwind: the shaman one is pretty cool - its the tornado right?
[0:53:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, the mage discs are great
[0:54:04] Kurama__95: The title is not acc-wide, so if you have on that one, you did the campaign on that one
[0:54:12] wolfcloudchaser80: And you SURF on top of the shaman tornado.
[0:54:21] cashthb: first time I heard someone calling the lame-ass disc cool
[0:54:29] HarryJPotter94: Hi I love your wig peepoHappy
[0:55:13] eielwind: when you almost got glad was it on druid?
[0:56:10] Bensiano: CAT!!!!!!!!!!
[0:56:12] dvkJoe: BAMM!
[0:56:17] Essiandar: well you're in luck, cuz rdruid is omega busted in pvp right now
[0:58:00] Eirchi: Hi Hazel! Floyd here now!
[0:58:09] Zuldak: i miss the ZM aesthetic
[0:58:30] cashthb: 9.2 was great
[0:58:33] cashthb: pocopoc
[0:58:33] Zuldak: 8.2 was the apology for 8.1 korthia
[0:58:34] sence_00: pocopoc
[0:58:35] eielwind: pococococopoc?
[0:58:35] morphexia: pocopoc
[0:58:37] GreenArrowed: pocpoc
[0:58:37] morphexia: :D
[0:58:38] dmorrygan: pocopoc ?
[0:59:42] fisherreads: can someone in chat explain what the bam sound notifies?
[0:59:52] Zuldak: there is a WQ up in azure span today. you play catch with otters
[1:00:01] Essiandar: ooo, that tranq before blind. makin moves hazel!
[1:00:29] Eirchi: Flintstones flashbacks, Bam Bam Bam
[1:02:18] Zuldak: the rogue seems very squishy
[1:02:37] chupathingi: Ohh whoa pvp
[1:03:35] Essiandar: Lool
[1:03:38] fisherreads: have you done any mythic plus with an aug evoker? I wondered how it worked in smaller groups or if they were desired.
[1:04:13] Hippwn: how do you pronounce your characters name?
[1:04:14] chupathingi: Personally I am not a fan of aug that are pugs. They have a DPS brain but are a utility class.
[1:04:30] executor223: executor223 converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[1:04:30] Streamlabs: executor223 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:04:40] Zuldak: Aug is the disc priest of evokers
[1:05:03] fisherreads: @zuldak that’s a good comparison!
[1:05:12] thatguynamedjans: Morning, Hazel! New Hair! :D
[1:05:15] Syphero: Coming from enh shaman (and being used to having a lot of utility) I tried Aug for the first time this season and absolutely loving it
[1:05:28] chupathingi: Eeeh disc takes skill so it's hard. Aug is really easy. It's just that they have a DPS brain so they don't dispell or fully utilize their kit
[1:05:30] thesral_: thesral_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 40 month streak!

[1:06:47] Streamlabs: alecto033 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:07:03] chupathingi: Aug is great for healers who don't fully want to DPS.
[1:07:10] sence_00: Aug is for when you want to be helpful, but want to avoid the stress of healing
[1:07:17] seamuscg: or u mean dps who dont fully want to heal chupathingi
[1:07:26] wolfcloudchaser80: I used to play a support class back in Everquest, so it's a familiar concept
[1:07:51] fisherreads: yeah I need to give my aug evoker a try. just see how it feels. I tend to gravitate toward support classes anyway.
[1:07:53] seamuscg: @seamuscg nvm i see what u mean now
[1:08:11] chupathingi: As long as the aug has a proper ui they are above avg
[1:09:10] Hippwn: maybe they had pretty high rating
[1:09:33] sence_00: Broken Short first!
[1:09:43] holymommades: you can dreamwalk to the druid order hall
[1:09:46] greenilladan: hey what is your current achievement score again?
[1:09:52] sence_00: it showed last time? Oh
[1:09:59] Raineve: I'm jealous of the bangs! How you doing today?<3
[1:10:01] chupathingi: I don't remember the lunar wing form taking to long post legion did they make it hard again?
[1:10:08] greenilladan: your videos have literally helped me for so many years - just wanted to say THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
[1:10:15] Czardonic: Man, I step away from Hazel's stream for what feels like a week, but judging by this hair it was a lot longer than that
[1:10:19] Blueofthenightfall: Didn't u needa do the whole chapter quest for. Rolen shore for the hoot hoot?
[1:10:56] kags158: Ahh love Wig #3!

[1:11:42] jassiboo: behnd u
[1:11:44] jassiboo: straight
[1:11:49] jassiboo: u passed it
[1:11:51] jassiboo: go back
[1:12:11] jassiboo: out of the plac youre at
[1:12:11] eielwind: lol
[1:12:26] sence_00: is trivial quests not on?
[1:12:41] holymommades: the sword on the all
[1:12:42] Daemavand: Trees man, such troublemakers
[1:12:47] heldtheline: It's the map right in front of the tree
[1:12:57] ntdrongo: is this the one you talk to for your mount to be ridable
[1:13:08] sence_00: thwe naaru
[1:13:09] Raineve: house chores done, food eaten and watching Hazel. It's a good Sunday :3
[1:13:50] funviking99: hazelWave
[1:13:55] SultryVoice: New hair!
[1:14:02] sence_00: thats it i think, Emerald Nightmare
[1:14:34] squiggszt: me when the hazel is nut
[1:14:40] judaxtheshaman: Good Morning! This wig is everything!
[1:14:53] sence_00: i THINK the last one or two quests are raid quests so you must be close to done
[1:15:14] Daemavand: I have a feeling not all class questlines are made equally lol
[1:15:25] fisherreads: sometimes is hard to figure out where you left off with this long quest chains
[1:15:53] eielwind: i sometimes use wowhead and go to the questline and they have a script you can copy/paste to see if you did the quest
[1:16:20] sence_00: its a really pretty flight form
[1:16:31] mrtame: I only have the Warrior one, but do they all have special mount summon animations? Cause the Warrior one is cool
[1:16:37] Crimzon7: btw quests is great for this
[1:16:52] mrsrockguru: I still have to get the Rogue order hall mounts they are the last ones I need. I have one npc to kill but its in Ogrimmar and I keep getting killed by the guards in the AH.
[1:16:53] traynor56: traynor56 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:16:53] Streamlabs: traynor56 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:16:55] sence_00: @mrtame ya they do, the rogue one is great
[1:17:07] fisherreads: I am leveling my Druid alt through legion to work on the class order hall as I go along. I have to get the owl bear form
[1:17:37] Streamlabs: halikulliihaistapaska -> all links are devoured at once.
[1:17:45] mrsrockguru: Nope my toon is at lvl 55 as I hate playing rogue
[1:18:00] Toiarc: Does anyone else have bug in garrison that level 1 plans are not learned and the tome you buy to learn them doesnt teach anything ???
[1:18:01] averageteacup: Runescape is fun, skill based, no classes
[1:18:08] widdlywhee: I've been gone for 3 seconds (or 9 months) and your hair is long again - what is this sorcery! <3
[1:18:13] mrtame: Being able to pick up transmog for any armor type is going to be such a game changer, I can't wait
[1:18:31] Zuldak: the runescape sailor shanty is pretty iconic
[1:18:37] Zuldak: ive never played it but i know that song
[1:18:39] Hippwn: She can grow her hair at will
[1:18:41] widdlywhee: Love the wig, suits you! <3
[1:18:41] cashthb: you could stream other games, like deus ex!
[1:18:55] Zuldak: dreamwalk has no CD
[1:18:58] Jakobsson69: Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:19:04] Admunsen: Wigs look great, are they rented, or is it an *investment* ?
[1:19:23] Zuldak: its why druids are broken for mogs: you can instantly dream walk in and out of dungeons
[1:19:47] eielwind: i dont understand how dreamwalk works in that regard @Zuldak lol, but i dont know druid well
[1:22:32] diarrhea_lad: yeah
[1:22:33] wrathofgob: yeah dks can
[1:22:33] Zuldak: DKs can too but they DO have a CD
[1:22:37] MrFck36: yes it can
[1:22:39] Zuldak: druids have no cd on dream walk
[1:22:48] wrathofgob: just a min cd
[1:22:52] MrFck36: 1 min on death gate
[1:24:48] eielwind: the power within is for balance of power questline for new artifact appearance i believe
[1:25:04] Zuldak: im not the only one who queues for a raid, forgets about it and log itno an alt only to then remember i queued and was waiting for it right?
[1:25:22] Ikitoro: !addon
[1:25:34] Kurama__95: You need the Broken Shore campaign until you get your last champion
[1:25:35] ntdrongo: what quest?
[1:25:37] GreenArrowed: maybe
[1:25:43] eielwind: thats annoying lol
[1:25:47] GreenArrowed: i haven't tried on any of mine recently
[1:25:55] seamuscg: this wig looks great
[1:26:00] Kurama__95: Your rogue had all champions
[1:26:02] MrFck36: yooo what addon is that???
[1:26:11] Kurama__95: I had to get all champions after they nerfed the requirements
[1:26:20] fisherreads: yeah. I had that on my priest - where I started breaching the tomb, and then they made the achievement account wide but I didn’t have it on my priest
[1:26:21] 6thbiscuit: I think you need to do half of it to recruit your class hall champion, then you're done with it.
[1:26:30] morphexia: from what i remembered yoiiu need to do some broken shore but not all of the achievements
[1:26:34] morphexia: half way
[1:26:44] morphexia: for alts i mean
[1:26:47] Kurama__95: Your rogue had some Broken Shore done, she had all champions unlocked
[1:27:29] Kurama__95: Do you have Champions of Legionfall in your quest log?
[1:27:44] maladal: Wait, is this an in-game tool? When did we get this feature?
[1:27:49] widdlywhee: How have you been? Any fishing ponds left in Canada or have you found a new hobby? <3
[1:28:03] Crizgo1: Getting the Legion Order Hall Mounts counts for the Mount Achieve for all classes right?
[1:28:11] bobbab5: Is that an add on, or part of the quest journal normally?
[1:28:24] Kurama__95: @maladal It's an addon called BTWQuests
[1:28:29] Zuldak: yeah you only have to visit the broken shore
[1:28:30] bobbab5: Thx
[1:28:48] Zuldak: i did this late bfa getting alts attuned to go into argus for ursul farming
[1:28:52] widdlywhee: A puppy dog! *faints in glee* <3 Any chance we could see the very good boy / girl?
[1:29:24] Zerpy: hazel, is there a food you love, that a lot of people dont like?
[1:30:32] HazelNuttyGames: https://youtu.be/v-Fyv94A-go
[1:30:36] Zuldak: @Zerpy Broccoli
[1:30:43] widdlywhee: So, he's not big on Twitch? Got it :D <3
[1:31:11] thalezra: The hair hazelShiny
[1:31:24] faelmist: hair <3
[1:31:25] Raineve: For me that would be brussel sprouts lol
[1:31:28] ScourgemomXo: i love bleu cheese! <3
[1:31:30] faelmist: looks amazing on you
[1:31:31] Daemavand: Blue cheese a love/hate taste in my experience
[1:31:46] cashthb: like blue cheese by itself or in a sandwich? everyone likes it in a sandwich
[1:31:53] Zuldak: grapefruit tastes awful and i like it
[1:32:00] widdlywhee: Moose is ADORABLE and a certified very good boy. 15/10 <3 Thanks for the link!
[1:32:03] satsumarc: Blue cheese and reindeer pizza is really good
[1:32:17] LKatey75: Hi! Like this wig, looks like your old hair a little
[1:32:23] satsumarc: i kid you not. It's a finnish thing. I was blown away when I had it the first time
[1:32:24] jakefx1: Im so sorry what?
[1:32:32] faelmist: see brussel sprouts is still something I don't trust: when I was a kid they were bitter af, but apparently in the last 30 years they have been engineered to be less bitter. I tried one the other day and I didn't hate it, and I don't know how to deal with it.
[1:33:18] sence_00: @faelmist not engineered, our parents were just really bad at cooking them
[1:33:44] LKatey75: lemon juice on the brussels sometimes helps
[1:33:49] faelmist: @sence_00 don't let my mother hear you say that! D:
[1:33:55] heldtheline: They've been bred to be less bitter
[1:34:19] faelmist: "In the late 1990s scientists identified specific chemicals, called glucosinolates, that made Brussels sprouts taste bitter. Plant breeders started growing old seeds, previously discarded for producing paltry harvests, to identify tastier versions with lower levels of these compounds."
[1:34:29] sandicheeks_: hello! i love the hair!
[1:34:38] eielwind: hyjal is one of my favorite zones, not sure why it, just is lol
[1:34:38] mcxoney: whats your favorite class aesthetic?
[1:34:50] ahnn112: I miss when night elf stuff looked like this
[1:35:05] Fadeerit: i actually completed my class mount when it was current content. well, all but rogue

[1:35:09] Zuldak: you just need to go back to the hall i think:?
[1:35:16] endless_pastrami: thisalee is by far the best follower of any class
[1:35:32] cashthb: this is very much phased already
[1:36:09] eielwind: how incredibly hard of a commitment is getting the spell tome mount?
[1:36:14] cashthb: think I saw it under balance
[1:36:15] Zuldak: apparently blizz thinks priest is the main character class. Both Calia and Xalatath were introduced to priests
[1:36:25] LastYouSaw: What made it easier? :O
[1:36:43] Kurama__95: Moonglade teleport is replaced by Dreamwalk
[1:36:43] sence_00: idk, the Mage Tower cant be outgeared anymore so that stinks
[1:36:50] karklop: moonglade portal is down
[1:37:23] MVPBuster: The mage tower is definitely easier now due to the talent tree reworks
[1:37:29] MVPBuster: so much free utility you didnt have in SL
[1:37:32] Zuldak: @sence_00 you can get a gear set with sockets and go laser bear. You just delete the challenge
[1:37:33] ahnn112: I did the warlock class mount a months ago took about 3 days
[1:37:49] Raineve: I sort of want to branch out and make a Horde character. Anyone know any good Horde Servers?
[1:38:44] GreenArrowed: baited
[1:39:14] zany_: I would have thought druid would have been one of your first legion hall mounts
[1:39:16] sanguinette: Eu - Argent Dawn
[1:39:17] thatguynamedjans: area-52 has a massive horde pop :D
[1:39:18] Kurama__95: Wowprogress has pop numbers
[1:39:20] MVPBuster: WoWanalytica
[1:39:24] wolfcloudchaser80: Hm, is Warcraftrealms still updated?
[1:39:33] Skrewtaype: I think Blizzard did something to break the AP
[1:39:38] Daemavand: It depends on what you mean by "good". What is good to you? High pop? RP? Fresh server? One with friends? A strong PVE scene?
[1:39:38] Skrewtaype: API*
[1:40:05] Triskelian: Is this where you have to meet with Malfurion and Cenarius?
[1:40:08] Daemavand: So I think its key to identify that first and then deciding on aserver will become easier
[1:40:17] manddrew: Is that quest tree from an addon? That would be so helpful lol
[1:40:30] Zuldak: 4 of the top 10 mount collectors in the world are druids. All i can ask is.... why?
[1:40:34] MVPBuster: Legion is definitely a pain i did balance of power for the first time right before 10.2 came out and it hurt my head where some of the NPCs were
[1:40:36] sandicheeks_: any chance you could share where i could aquire some good hairs, ive been looking and not sure where to look online
[1:40:50] ntdrongo: you just completing the campaign?
[1:41:44] roxywilde: lace front?
[1:42:00] Hippwn: Does anyone know if there is an addon that shows a timer for accepting a pvp queue?
[1:42:08] Espartico: Hi Hazel! I have been away from retail for a long time. I have my warrior at lv70 but I am so lost with retail haha!
[1:42:28] sandicheeks_: okay awesome! ty i lost a lot of hair from rapid weight loss from surgery so im looking into wigs now
[1:42:51] wolfcloudchaser80: Tomorrow is new patch day? Or is it a week from tomorrow?
[1:43:09] LuckeyAtel: Omg I LOVE this wig, Hazel!!! It's so cool.
[1:43:23] MVPBuster: I used wowtrack(dot)gg for seeing where i was in progress with BoP it helped a good bit if thats any help :kekw
[1:43:28] Natastepz: @Hippwn Safe Que on curseforge
[1:43:39] wolfcloudchaser80: lol, was thinking today was monday. Derp.
[1:43:48] averageteacup: oh! i need to go back, excited to take Gilneas back
[1:43:49] LuckeyAtel: I actually super love the various wigs. Literally such a vibe.
[1:44:13] witchhobbit: i just finished an ep of the wheel of time. i'm loving it, makes me really want to read the books. do you recommend them? i forget how you feel about that series
[1:44:15] eielwind: is there much new and upgraded gear in 10.2.5 or no?
[1:44:19] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm just +1 from you, US Mountain zone.
[1:44:45] Triskelian: Did you see the new Thunderfury-themed bows on Wowhead yet?
[1:44:45] 324bee21: 10.2.6 or 7 really needs a Firelands skip... like the Siege one
[1:45:04] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm oddly looking forward to Dracthyr's Soar being largely a mount replacement.
[1:45:31] satsumarc: Sanderson <3
[1:45:45] 324bee21: looking at you Game of Thrones
[1:45:46] Zuldak: *cough* GRRM *cough*
[1:45:54] For_Real_Real: the show is pretty good and the stuff that is different, makes sense to me as to why they were changed.  its a big book to cram into 10 episodes
[1:45:57] Sharkeys: lol pretty much what im expecting of asoiaf
[1:45:57] GreenArrowed: we're looking at your grrm hazelCry hazelCry
[1:46:08] 324bee21: one of my favotire book series Guardians of the Flame just stopped it's like the author got bored
[1:46:13] Danoria: The original author knew he was going to die, so he and I believe his wife helped pick Sanderson to finish them
[1:46:23] ernie_1776: the wheel of time books are huge, I got burned out trying to read the series
[1:46:45] satsumarc: And Patrick Rothfuss. Hope he gets that last book out at some point
[1:46:45] LuckeyAtel: Hazel do you have your computer specs listed anywhere - youtube, perhaps? Looking to upgrade my bf's pc.
[1:47:08] witchhobbit: the middle book syndrome is very much a thing haha
[1:47:31] wolfcloudchaser80: And Patrick Rothfuss is a lesser known version of GRRM... Still waiting on Doors of Stone.
[1:47:34] LuckeyAtel: No worries! Thank you anyway!
[1:47:40] ahnn112: I like how legion brought class identity i hope hero talents bring it back
[1:47:42] 324bee21: anyone else sad about "losing" mounts to use if you decide to Dragonride in the old zones this week
[1:47:47] LuckeyAtel: That helps, thank you so much.
[1:47:49] witchhobbit: @satsumarc they're both going to need to hire sanderson to finish their series LUL
[1:48:19] witchhobbit: what a compliment to ask someone to finish your work though
[1:48:37] 324bee21: I mean you can't dragonride on the old mounts yet that is a big mistake IMO
[1:48:48] Zuldak: im excited for the outland cup
[1:48:54] widdlywhee: I know this wasn't for me, but I've recently upgraded to a 4080 and can highly recommend it.
[1:49:00] Nicstar1007: omg that wig :O you look stunning
[1:49:06] satsumarc: @haleych oh damn so true
[1:49:07] Mkidm5: is the new patch live?
[1:49:11] sence_00: @324bee21 things take time, Id rather have this now than nothing until War Within
[1:49:32] Sharkeys: LOL i mean he admitted he wrote himself into a corner and didnt know how to get out of it
[1:49:38] jakefx1: I had a friend skip all the Bran Chapters to speed it up! hazelCry
[1:50:08] witchhobbit: did you have to take a break from the pally campaign? i know it has some time gated stuff
[1:50:20] Triskelian: There is a Dalaran portal in the Dreamgrove
[1:50:27] LKatey75: I'm looking forward to the end of the month book wise, Sarah J Maas finally came out with a new one :D
[1:50:39] jakefx1: ahhh yes!!
[1:50:46] Mkidm5: I normally dont farm sha of anger, the other day i just felt like killing him randomly, got the mouny
[1:50:49] jakefx1: speaking of tea, i would like a cup, brb
[1:51:09] Triskelian: @Mkidm5 Grats!
[1:51:14] LKatey75: Fantasy and Luv
[1:51:23] LuckeyAtel: @Nicstar1007 I KNOW SHE DOES!!
[1:51:32] Mkidm5: thanks
[1:51:58] Zuldak: palies are nice by sending you an uber but druids give you teleportation
[1:52:22] DarnMoose: hazel have u ever played on rp servers
[1:52:27] fisherreads: I think it depends on your personal taste. I wasn’t a fan of Sarah J Maas since I found the writing to be a bit juvenile but I know lots of people that enjoy her stuff. for every book there is a reader and for every reader a book.
[1:53:13] zany_: what was that teleport menu
[1:53:37] zany_: ty!
[1:53:38] boro3456: did you know canada is only country in the world that has its own maple syrup federal reserves?
[1:53:49] cashthb: what did you roleplay as? was it a Gosling character?
[1:53:49] Talonias: The maple syrup.... is it Crown Bourbon Maple Syrup?
[1:53:50] eielwind: no MoonGuard for you Hazel?
[1:53:59] WhippWhapp: o/ Happy Sunday! @HazelNuttyGames knockin' it outta the park today, *humina humina* <3 PogChamp LUL
[1:54:03] maladal: Probably for economic reasons
[1:54:09] Zuldak: do they have their own hockey federal reserve too?
[1:54:24] fisherreads: I keep seeing people running around in the guild House Hippos and laugh every time I see it
[1:54:28] averageteacup: "we running out maple syrup!" is a serious emergency :D
[1:54:35] Arabany: means that noone else really eat maple syrup :)
[1:54:49] Arabany: I'm not sure you can even find it in my countrie
[1:54:54] Talonias: That is the fancy maple syrup that I got from Costco recently
[1:55:02] etherealbeluga: Moonguard is my main server. I love seeing so many people just walking around, talking to eachother, especially in SW.
[1:55:38] Aseopp: I put maple syrup in my coffee
[1:55:58] jshukster: thats why I only use randomized names for all characters
[1:56:01] Aseopp: I hear its good on icecream too
[1:56:03] jshukster: full immersion lol
[1:56:07] Zuldak: pamala onepuncherson is awesome
[1:56:08] witchhobbit: thats what i love about character creation too
[1:56:11] Daemavand: Aye, I like having names like that too, even if I dont RP I like to think of each toon as their own little character or personality
[1:56:14] thatguynamedjans: Hey!! was that a swing at my monk Twopunch?? hahaha
[1:56:20] Daemavand: but thats definitely not the case for everyone :D
[1:56:26] eielwind: the goldshire inn on moonguard is a special place lol
[1:56:41] Zuldak: the name pamala is always associated with pamala anderson for me :/
[1:56:44] ernie_1776: I hope Blizz doesn't get rid of regular riding/flying, I'm not a big fan of Dragon Riding/Dynamic Flight
[1:56:47] Zuldak: baywatch was popular back in the day
[1:56:49] Triskelian: The only toon I have that has a punny name is my evoker, Triscaleian :D
[1:57:08] Daemavand: Before going to Lightbringer I played in a RP guild for a couple of years which was really cool, they were lovely! But RP isnt my thing I found out
[1:57:18] iamryman: good ole palmela handerson
[1:57:23] Zuldak: well EPL pamala is dead too
[1:57:28] chrisztubah: Isnt she a ghost?
[1:57:32] cashthb: she's also dead, she's a ghost
[1:57:38] fisherreads: way back I remember being in a worgen rp guild that wanted to reclaim Gilneas. ready made me feel immersed in the game even though I suck at RP
[1:57:39] zenfulkatoria: I’m late but happy Sunday everyone ☺️
[1:57:54] Danoria: I love fantasy books. Neil Gaimen said it best in Coraline“Fairy tales are more than true — not because they tell us dragons exist, but because they tell us dragons can be beaten.”
[1:57:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Aww
[1:58:08] manoomu: that quest bugged for me so bad i had to llog in right after reset to be able to do it
[1:58:20] Neltalie: Very pretty wig :D
[1:58:27] 324bee21: that questline was so good the first time through
[1:59:00] 324bee21: does your dragonriding customization carry over from one cahracter to alts
[1:59:16] Toiarc: I downloaded this addon that warns me if there is pvp players nearby and now Im in BG and its constant drumm whool sound that "10 pvp enemies near by"
[1:59:22] Zuldak: you need to take the portal
[1:59:29] Zuldak: go back to the building
[1:59:39] 324bee21: ugh so I have to do it for my alts I am so lazy thanks
[1:59:40] cashthb: you can try to walk into a fire gate
[1:59:43] Zuldak: should be a portal in the bulding
[1:59:43] Triskelian: I think it's because you're in an instanced version of Hyjal
[1:59:53] manoomu: I'm excited for the randomization option coming with outland races
[2:00:16] Zuldak: weird i wonder if this has been broken
[2:00:33] witchhobbit: i keep thinking the glowing fires were a portal
[2:00:52] 324bee21: @manoomu yeah I will slap that on everyone  trying to get it first day
[2:00:59] zany_: it's 5am here and it's already so hot
[2:01:01] zenfulkatoria: so many instances are locking me in that way. like they forget, we actually want to leave in a convenient way
[2:01:18] starmagicka: have you ever played runescape
[2:01:22] 324bee21: the random drake thing and a recolor of that mog
[2:01:23] jakefx1: is Earl Grey with honey any good, we're about to find out
[2:01:25] Zuldak: wow dragons are all just dittos who can shape shift into whatever
[2:01:27] Triskelian: I think you get a recolor of the transmog
[2:01:28] witchhobbit: i wish the priest class mount didn't have the trailing animation. any mount with that kind of trail stuff annoys my eyes
[2:01:31] manoomu: i think there's a new recolor of that transmog but don't quote me
[2:01:40] starmagicka: oh wow really
[2:01:51] zany_: australia
[2:01:55] Appletwigg: Curious what you don't like about classic. No shade on retail though
[2:01:58] cashthb: the twilight highland races were a blast on advanced, i didn't even care about the reward
[2:01:58] Zuldak: the lunar wing is a cosmetic option form the barber
[2:02:32] Zuldak: do you already have it?
[2:02:43] goplacidly56: have to learn it first i think
[2:02:48] Zuldak: yes it is account wide
[2:02:56] GreenArrowed: yes
[2:02:57] Triskelian: It *is* accout wide
[2:03:29] zany_: I refuse to believe you don't have druid mount already lol
[2:03:44] witchhobbit: well would it have even been an option to do the questline for you
[2:03:50] witchhobbit: if you didn't do it
[2:03:57] Zuldak: weird
[2:04:44] Zuldak: its a 2 person form. someone can ride on you in luanar form
[2:04:54] silent6821: i think you have to "active" that form at some npc in your class hall
[2:05:00] zany_: because the ley race takes so long and is buggy
[2:05:11] Daemavand: The dragon :D
[2:05:15] ernie_1776: Sandstone Drake
[2:05:16] Thaxorin: mine is where you turn to a black kitty with wings
[2:05:16] witchhobbit: i don't think i've seen that one
[2:05:19] Thaxorin: you become a mount
[2:05:23] Zuldak: got to be careful of phasing knocking the other person off
[2:05:27] sence_00: ya sandstone
[2:05:29] HappyBeeNoizes: obsidian nightwing
[2:05:41] Crimzon7: Skychaser as a dragonriding mount would be funny
[2:05:49] witchhobbit: oh i love that lol
[2:05:51] Daemavand: Oh I've never seen that! That IS cool
[2:05:53] sence_00: or Tarecogsa I think now if im on a toon with that
[2:06:09] wolfcloudchaser80: Would lay down some serious tendies for those mounts.
[2:06:22] Triskelian: If it's *your* mount, *you* should sit in the upper chair - that's the Captain's chair!
[2:06:26] Zuldak: no
[2:06:34] mrsrockguru: No they have not
[2:06:37] seamuscg: I hope they bring back the pajamas
[2:06:40] HappyBeeNoizes: no but they may
[2:06:41] Kaltaer: They might after the TCG stuff is done
[2:06:56] PyahPyahPyahSoda: you were able to get the old blizzard bear at the most recent blizzcon
[2:06:58] Thaxorin: I was talking about the Obsidian Nightwing two person mount it was part of the recruit a friend
[2:07:00] wolfcloudchaser80: I feel like it would be ok to make them available after 5 or 6 years have passed since that Con.
[2:07:03] Sharkeys: only one i know is they did a skin in OW that others could get afterwards but nothing else has been available
[2:07:51] Ujai321: You know, the one stream I can't watch, and then this
[2:08:00] Ujai321: Looks good ^^
[2:08:01] Triskelian: I *love* Thisalee, she can be so freaking bloodthirsty :D
[2:08:31] Daemavand: You know that's true, you can now hair flip again lol!
[2:08:36] Zuldak: sub goals paid for the wig
[2:09:06] Thaxorin: so are these quests to get other druid forms?
[2:09:15] Zuldak: new twitch emotes?
[2:09:20] Frejski1: rainbow wig sub goal? :o
[2:09:28] wolfcloudchaser80: I feel like that experiment with the sub goal was successful enough that... well, almost feels like leaving money on the table in NOT doing it.
[2:09:38] odin_borsons_backpack: i miss legion
[2:09:39] witchhobbit: new emotes would be funnnn
[2:09:46] witchhobbit: who doesn't love emotes
[2:10:04] sence_00: today you match!
[2:10:07] Zuldak: you could have a wig to match the emote
[2:10:07] witchhobbit: you could choose a few colors
[2:10:07] Marmoh: Also sub badges :p
[2:10:10] wolfcloudchaser80: Make a squirrel with a wig emote!
[2:10:17] manoomu: how many wigs are in your rotation now?
[2:10:26] Daemavand: I like the sub badges too
[2:10:38] manoomu: i looks really nice!
[2:10:39] Zuldak: the acorn hatch into the tree that some bird planted in that planter a while back
[2:10:40] HappyBeeNoizes: thats cute
[2:10:41] manoomu: it*
[2:11:26] archermoo: Like the new wig!
[2:11:28] Zuldak: moose with one ear up and one ear flop
[2:11:28] Marmoh: Yeah! A squirrel emerging from the acorn
[2:11:44] Daemavand: That would be a worthy sub goal to work towards
[2:11:48] Daemavand: would you need a new lens to do that?
[2:11:52] Daemavand: His seems pretty wide
[2:11:59] wolfcloudchaser80: Big stream goal, there: random Moose visits.
[2:12:02] Thaxorin: Do you have a favourite expansion?
[2:12:07] Daemavand: but what about... a Moose hammock
[2:12:15] Zuldak: A squirrel from an acorn reminds me of that mammoth from the vault in forbidden reach that HATCHED from an egg. Makes no sense
[2:12:16] Daemavand: Ahhhh gotcha
[2:12:31] anduinwindrunner: love the new wig! looks gorgeous on you!
[2:12:37] Daemavand: The plushie couch could always become a Moose couch...
[2:13:05] archermoo: Moose is, well, a moose! :)
[2:13:05] Daemavand: lol oh dear
[2:13:22] jakefx1: hazelTen
[2:13:35] eielwind: the music feels weird lmao
[2:13:45] dergNwolf: yeah that music was weird werenwLUL
[2:13:57] archermoo: A very martial fanfare.
[2:14:02] eielwind: I could see that music for pally or warrior maybe lol
[2:14:03] wolfcloudchaser80: I believe you're right
[2:14:21] jgbrit: Howdy! Just got in from work, can I see you wig please? Looks lovely
[2:14:27] lewis_dub: LOVE the hair Hazel!
[2:14:33] witchhobbit: yeah that music needed to be more mystical
[2:14:39] Daemavand: ahahahaha
[2:14:43] jgbrit: That's stunning!
[2:15:01] seamuscg: depends on race
[2:15:01] ThisIsZephora: thats the 1
[2:15:09] Daemavand: Is it possible to braid wigs, or would it not hold well? or risk damaging the fibers?
[2:15:13] Triskelian: The different druid races have different colors
[2:15:13] Zuldak: the lunar wing color is based on race
[2:15:13] jgbrit: Did you get the paladin ones done?
[2:15:14] sence_00: I think the hidden artifact might unlock another or something
[2:15:17] ThisIsZephora: ya 1 per race
[2:15:22] Zuldak: trolls get brown, worgen get white\
[2:15:28] Daemavand: "One stone palace, please"
[2:15:30] jland337: @HazelNuttyGames hi hazel need help. my toon is stuck in and old raid. A boss has me stuck and unable to use abilities. How can i unstuck/die when im unable to do anything?  NEED HELP!!
[2:15:41] Aseopp: I would really like to have a mailbox that looks like the ones in stormwind
[2:15:46] Hippwn: The color depended on  your race
[2:15:58] Zuldak: @jland337 log out for a bit and play an alt for a bit
[2:16:06] anduinwindrunner: @jland337 logout at least for 30 mins
[2:16:33] dergNwolf: ooooh the venthyr mailbox
[2:16:35] dergNwolf: I would use that
[2:17:03] zany_: can you get to aszuna a-sooner
[2:17:14] anduinwindrunner: they removed that afaik
[2:17:21] jland337: @Zuldak @anduinwindrunner @HazelNuttyGames THINKS GUYS :)
[2:17:25] Thaxorin: what are you trying to do?
[2:17:45] HappyBeeNoizes: they have atoaon move
[2:17:48] MysteriousMind: It's still there when you scroll further down, the self-help options I believe
[2:17:51] morphexia: they still have it
[2:17:55] Vivica_x0: unstuck tool exisits on battle .net website
[2:17:57] HappyBeeNoizes: u have ato ago to hte website not the in game help
[2:18:11] Crizgo1: @HazelNuttyGames Do you have any GM stories in all the years you've been playing?
[2:18:18] Valheeru: hiyaaa allll :p
[2:18:18] Triskelian: Oo, not a blanket. You need an Oodie!
[2:18:24] sence_00: @jland337 i think unstuck is in the support panel at the bottom somewhere, or you can logout for 15min and see if that fixes it
[2:18:38] wolfcloudchaser80: @jland337 I'm kinda curious, what boss is it? I don't want to get locked down myself one day!
[2:18:47] Crimzon7: May i recommend an addon?
[2:18:56] mitchwebbs123: what addon is that?
[2:18:58] jgbrit: Speaking of mission tables, have you started doing your shadowlands one on the regular again?
[2:19:00] Thaxorin: whoa... what is this addon?
[2:19:03] witchhobbit: oodies are actually one of the best things to ever exist lol
[2:19:12] anduinwindrunner: I love how rarity runs smooth on your pc. Mine gets very laggy whenever I open it BibleThump
[2:19:31] shaymster: when you get your pala mounts you can buy something to use it in Divine Charge.
[2:19:36] silent6821: completing all legion class halls gives you a feat of strength too.
[2:20:12] jgbrit: I used the red and blue charger and paired it with the Blackrock Foundry tier set
[2:20:14] eielwind: what’s the feat of strength give you, anything @silent6821 ?
[2:20:44] Crimzon7: It's called HidingBar. It will hide all the minimap buttons off to the side of the screen that expands on mouseover
[2:21:00] Zuldak: ret is pretty simple
[2:21:01] jgbrit: Don't go holy, it's REKT at the moment
[2:21:06] witchhobbit: i like the aoe passive crusader strike ret build
[2:21:15] eielwind: I think Ret pally is pretty simple
[2:21:16] Valheeru: minimapbuttonbutton is the one
[2:21:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Ret feels like it really hard hitting in outdoor/questing content, at least.
[2:21:42] jgbrit: Have a quick look at the BRF set
[2:21:43] anduinwindrunner: s2 armor is really cool
[2:21:46] snakesandfoxes: The pala set is cool WITHOUT the helmet
[2:21:51] Zuldak: i was able to do the mage tower as ret and i am terrible at dps so it cant be that bad
[2:21:51] sence_00: this set is VERY silly
[2:21:51] snakesandfoxes: The helmet completely goofs it out
[2:21:53] witchhobbit: i've been enjoying how simple ret pally is. it doesn't take away the fun
[2:21:56] snakesandfoxes: 100%
[2:21:58] goplacidly56: the King lol
[2:22:02] Valheeru: they tried to recreate the judgement set but failed
[2:22:02] eielwind: lol “he looks like a chest piece”
[2:22:04] jakefx1: I think that set is underwhelming
[2:22:09] ItsLtLavender: veteran tier is blue. I think it looks the best :(
[2:22:18] jgbrit: Have a quick look at the BRF set
[2:22:25] Minobard: what does the pvp set color look like
[2:22:35] eielwind: just get the mythic set on him, ez
[2:22:38] Prunusek: I'm using MinimapButtonBag Reborn addon to hide other minimap button.
[2:22:49] witchhobbit: i really love current pally tier but it gets a lot of hate :(
[2:22:51] Minobard: the white one looks neat
[2:22:58] witchhobbit: the sword shoulders are awesome
[2:23:00] Minobard: ty for showing it hazel
[2:23:22] Crizgo1: Locks get great Tier too :)
[2:23:28] Crizgo1: Must be a clothy thing
[2:23:30] anduinwindrunner: season 2 priest tier set was how I imagined a paladin would look like
[2:23:34] witchhobbit: i'm having such a hard time choosing between pally and priest for new main
[2:23:45] Zuldak: the paladin time rift set (Valhalas) is a statement
[2:23:46] eielwind: I really like my mythic DH amir tier set
[2:23:52] Vivica_x0: Any idea how to get more 7th Legion Service Medals from BFA? Trying to get exp potion
[2:23:54] witchhobbit: yeah now see i wish i could mix plate and cloth mog SO bad
[2:24:29] anduinwindrunner: dh set is awesome because it's based on titan Sargeras
[2:24:32] snakesandfoxes: s1 tier was intentionally bad because new talents had just come out
[2:24:42] witchhobbit: @Vivica_x0 various things, they have world quests/emissaries, when you fill a paragon cache bar, a heroic warfront gives you 50 or 15
[2:24:43] snakesandfoxes: Some were tuned fine, but they intentionally didn't change gameplay
[2:24:45] Zuldak: the guardian druid season 2 is winning with 87% of the vote
[2:24:47] Crizgo1: Do you think they're going to do  recolors of the appearances that get picked or do you think they'll just be literally the same colorizations?
[2:24:54] sence_00: Max had a stream where he talks to high end players of each spec and it seemed like a bunch were due to reworks. The S1 or S2 bonuses no longer make sense in a bunch of cases
[2:24:59] Minobard: i liked the look of S1 for Warrior but the set bonus for arms is not my fave
[2:25:01] doom_llama: the dk set looks so good, I rolled a gnome dk so I can have a lil guy with the spikey helmet
[2:25:04] eielwind: are they going to be recoloring the sets? would feel weird having s3 tier twice in a row
[2:25:41] witchhobbit: i wish they mentioned if there were going to be recolors. i think people are somewhat voting on that idea
[2:26:00] eielwind: who doesn’t want 14 colors of the same tier
[2:26:11] Zuldak: oh no no... this cave reminds me of agatha and the mage tower...
[2:26:20] anduinwindrunner: I'm really curious about fated mount reward, SL fated mount was really cute
[2:26:24] cashthb: dunno frost mages voting for s3 tier really weirded me out, I thought most of us dislikes glacial spike
[2:26:39] Zuldak: i had issues dodging giant flaming rocks
[2:26:42] manoomu: maybe we're finally getting our catepillar mount
[2:26:48] wwnik: bring the catapillar mount
[2:26:49] Zuldak: and the imps kept exploding
[2:26:54] Crizgo1: Imagine if they just had ALL the set appearances mixed - i.e. Tier 1 for LFR/Normal, Tier 2 for Heroic, Tier 3 for Mythic
[2:26:58] Minobard: do the jigglesworth look but on a dragon
[2:27:10] Zuldak: i want my duck mount, blizz
[2:27:43] Zuldak: let me ride one of these giant weirdly neckless ducks
[2:27:45] witchhobbit: yeah i'd prefer a duck mount finally
[2:27:52] witchhobbit: or bakar!!!
[2:27:56] eielwind: I was hoping the new dragonriding mount that looks like a tree would change on seasons like the ancient
[2:27:56] manoomu: vyranoth mount skin to match her sibling drops
[2:28:06] Colt_Engineer: did you get hair extentions?
[2:28:12] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[2:28:12] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:28:18] Minobard: Mr. Ducksworth as the mount
[2:28:20] Triskelian: An *aquatic* duck mount!
[2:28:21] Zuldak: A Ysera skin mount would also be cool
[2:28:22] Colt_Engineer: ah
[2:28:25] Colt_Engineer: as I was
[2:28:30] eielwind: we need a frog mount like the one we fish up in every raid 😁
[2:28:41] wolfcloudchaser80: People raised such a uproar over wanting a moose mount that it finally happened. So who knows, maybe duck...
[2:28:42] morphexia: they should make a duck mount, its already there for pvp quest xD
[2:28:43] anduinwindrunner: @haleych bakar mounts were datamined back in 10.0.7 but they didn't release them :( hopefully we'll get them in next season
[2:28:52] witchhobbit: delas <3
[2:29:07] Zuldak: violet hold heroic is the BANE of mog collectors. once a day lockout and the bosses are random and have unique mogs
[2:29:09] tiyanigean: @eielwind there are BfA frog mounts, but no dragonfrog mounts
[2:29:14] Colt_Engineer: how's the puppers?
[2:29:29] witchhobbit: @anduinwindrunner thats why i was thinking it could work as a fated mount because of the datamined one
[2:29:50] Colt_Engineer: every dog is different, they all have their own personalities
[2:29:56] Aseopp: I just found a random food generator to figure out a lunch idea. It gave me Gelatine.
[2:30:23] cashthb: maybe he wanted to eat them
[2:30:32] anduinwindrunner: oh....
[2:30:42] Aseopp: haha, yea.. i think its broken
[2:31:06] wolfcloudchaser80: I didn't expect to be googling "random food generator" today, yet here we are.
[2:31:35] Aseopp: @wolfcloudchaser80 care to share?
[2:32:04] Aseopp: I need sourdough pizza now
[2:32:18] witchhobbit: yesss sourdough pizza sairaNodders
[2:32:30] Smelladafarts: You should try yummly, you can imput what you have at home and will generate recipes off what you have.
[2:32:36] morphexia: is it good?
[2:32:37] Zuldak: just put the toppings in a bowl if you're gonna thin crust.
[2:33:25] wolfcloudchaser80: @Aseopp I don't know which one you used, the one I just picked was from "randommer" and biscuits and gravy sound pretty good.

[2:33:56] russtrotter: my pantry is often a journey through time... i.e. "what kind of things in jars and cans did they have in 2019?"
[2:34:04] LKatey75: I love sushi bowls
[2:34:13] Zuldak: my wife puts rice and various sushi toppings in a bowl and calls it good
[2:35:06] Zuldak: dont forget your side hustle in bitcoin Kappa

[2:38:43] Aseopp: Pizza time! ty for the genius idea Hazel
[2:38:57] sence_00: you might be able to do all 5 at once now
[2:38:59] Arabany: I do not like guides and disagree with some parts of them. They are kind of one sided: you should take this, this and this. I prefer testing things myself.
[2:39:01] anduinwindrunner: LUL
