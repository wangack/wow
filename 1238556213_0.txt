[1:39:51] Stronku: I love MT. Hope they make more content like this
[1:39:58] TheAverageGoob: I did all classes on the original mage tower, and this new one is MUCH harder
[1:40:00] Douchecakes: the old MT you could out gear and gave ppl hope
[1:40:05] Streamcrush: there's a lot of unforgiving mechanics in the mage tower too, you either do it right or you die
[1:40:08] RiskyBusines_ez: towelie you're not spinning enough
[1:40:10] RiskyBusines_ez: :(
[1:40:51] pavepawns: depends on some fights cause a bad example is tulgar (the tauren) no class doing that fight would ever fight like that. not because its different or optimal but its the opposite. on ww you specifically gotta not do dmg on tulgar constantly or u just die slowly so it forces you to do a dragged out fight
[1:40:53] Lausten: @Synonymous Yeah they tested that it worked. Not all possible combinations of gear possible. Do you realise how long that would take? NotLikeThis
[1:41:17] Synonymous: about as long as all the hotfixing
[1:41:54] Lazugo: @Synonymous You are a crazy fucker
[1:42:04] Lausten: Not quite. As the hotfixes are discovered by the data available by hundreds of thousands of players doing it vs the PTR where maybe a handful of players went to test it..
[1:42:42] Gingerprimer: Yeah nobody in the grand scheme of thing even play the ptr
[1:43:23] Synonymous: i feel like its worth it if you want happy players.  i feel sorry for people's wasted time because they threw out untested content..
[1:43:27] KaisenSiru: pieS
[1:43:55] pavepawns: wasted time? its not like the mage tower hasnt been easily completed by ppl before hotfixes

[1:44:31] Ezekyler: Mage Tower PTSD towRee
[1:44:36] Synonymous: no need to fix it if its easy.  multiple days worth of fixes btw... LUL
[1:44:37] AureliusXV: same
[1:44:39] Gingerprimer: Nah Sylvans will no be "reedemed"
[1:44:40] brozzy: brozzy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 87 months! Just do TI!!
[1:44:54] brozzy: Nice auto correct
[1:44:55] pavepawns: depends on fights again
[1:45:06] pavepawns: cause fury is atm probly the easiest thing they added
[1:45:15] pavepawns: by a mile from legions version
[1:45:21] Synonymous: its scary the bar is so low we defend this stuff
[1:45:23] AureliusXV: watched nerf do the guardian right when it dropped in sl gear pretty crazy
[1:45:32] RiskyBusines_ez: @pavepawns brew and BM also up there
[1:45:44] Lausten: @Synonymous Your definition of untested is wrong. Thats why I said earlier I had hoped they went for a template instead of allowing all of the whacked combinations of gear that people have used to cheese the fights.
[1:45:54] nokiahanx: @towelliee took me over 150 pulls but finally got felbear
[1:46:19] Synonymous: alright sure, not untested. insufficiently tested.  happy?

[1:46:22] Stronku: should everyone be able to?
[1:46:26] TheAverageGoob: Those are people who min/max everything
[1:46:44] fistofnature: players should be challenged and struggle a bit, its healthy for them
[1:46:46] Khoulwhip: 98% of players think they can play in the top 2% skill level...lol
[1:46:47] dranet11: isnt it supposed to be difficult?
[1:46:55] AureliusXV: i dont even play guardian and i got it pretty quick
[1:46:59] pavepawns: i mean the fights i can personally say were not properly tuned are fury,bm,ww,arcane,feral druid they were sadly far easier then the older fights
[1:47:02] TheAverageGoob: I agree
[1:47:10] AureliusXV: KEKW
[1:47:11] pacificmc1: They have no shame tho so they won't
[1:47:13] Gillrad: LUL
[1:47:14] skreng: big true
[1:47:16] TheRiwen: nice you like the tower. I did not like it in legion so will not do it now
[1:47:18] Layliah79: i'm wearing azerite gear for the Agility boost LUL
[1:47:20] Synonymous: this is how they want us i g;uess.  hours spent and frustrated.
[1:47:20] falldrgn: I mean this stuff is supposed to be hard... that was the point. Sure the cutting edge players will get it easier.. its the same with any thing like that
[1:47:21] pilhass10: What? I disagree
[1:47:21] LUKA_THIM: i wasted like 50k to do 5/7
[1:47:26] Bernardo994: another ball dropped
[1:47:26] aptrist: the average player in games is generally way lower than people think any metric
[1:47:29] Mitchendo64: AH I love it when players get what they want but blizzard finds some way to make it so the players hate it LUL
[1:47:29] AureliusXV: bad blizzard
[1:47:30] TheAverageGoob: This should have been for fun and maybe <10 attempts since the original is so difficult, but then you get the hardcore people who complain it's too easy and a joke
[1:47:37] DrWraithjr: KEKW blizzard having enough self awareness to feel shame
[1:47:40] Gingerprimer: Yeah there were tons of players that resubed for the MT expecting MT of 7.3 of 7.3.5 and not what we got got
[1:47:43] dranet11: they did do testing but ok dude
[1:47:43] falldrgn: But if you put it in and nerf it.. the people that got it back then will say its a joke\
[1:47:48] falldrgn: or its not fair
[1:47:53] binkz77: all the time we spend farming borrowed power and can't use it let us use it and there's nobproblems
[1:47:56] pacificmc1: @dranet11 players did testing* and very little of it =)
[1:47:57] Stronku: maybe there should have been to different modes or something
[1:47:57] deeebag: mt is fine
[1:48:02] Stronku: two*
[1:48:14] Decree34: Does blizz even have a QA anymore?
[1:48:18] pacificmc1: not rly
[1:48:24] pacificmc1: they fired most of their QA
[1:48:29] TheRiwen: @deeebag no it is not. it not what people exspected.
[1:48:33] Synonymous: its sad
[1:48:43] Decree34: that's what I thoughts
[1:48:47] AureliusXV: pally set does look nice
[1:48:52] deeebag: @deeebag Its a challenge. its fine
[1:49:06] pavepawns: the only fights i think that needs a tuning fix is atm havoc DH rest have already had nerfs and i couldnt find any major issues with most fights. besides healer and havoc challenge
[1:49:07] KaisenSiru: Definitely made a lot of gold from the 200 Leviathan eyes I had in the reagent bank thanks to TW socket scaling attributes
[1:49:32] dranet11: there's nothing wrong with the mt as it is
[1:49:35] dranet11: you just need to work for it
[1:49:40] Ezekyler: what i hate the most in this fight is how useless Velen is
[1:49:54] elunesdruid: u need a lot of cheese gear :D
[1:49:54] Steamweaverr: @towelliee Is there somewhere I can watch some of your really old streams?
[1:49:56] deeebag: @dranet11 big agree
[1:50:02] dranet11: you dont need cheese gear at all
[1:50:05] retro_justice: how's season of mastery doing, anyone know
[1:50:08] dranet11: i got my mount first week with only SL geared chars
[1:50:10] pavepawns: @dranet11 exactly i feel the exact same. in fact i wouldnt mind if they buffed some fights ww,fury cause its a shame how easy they are
[1:50:51] fistofnature: some guy on my server bought all the bfa consumables and has them going steady for 5k EACH for unbridled fury
[1:50:53] fistofnature: its insane
[1:50:56] elunesdruid: I tell u whats wrong. Fighting 200 tries for bear and hearing someone got it by 4th try because of some unbalanced enchants. So yes there is something wrong with the tower
[1:50:57] LUKA_THIM: i had like 10000s of bfa gems herbs pots but im not a hoarder so i vendored them all before
[1:51:11] Udovar575: i have a warrior main in my guild who is crying he can't beat the fury challenge... and that's one of the easiest ones LUL
[1:51:15] nemolachs: @dranet11 i got it without any gear at all KEKW
[1:51:18] TioMeko: I been trying on my fury warrior for a while now and i still can't get it. Literally just can't do enough damage
[1:51:26] Gillrad: at the same time, its easy for you to say it's not tuned correctly because you haven't done it yet
[1:51:29] Synonymous: fml those sandwiches look good
[1:51:35] Layliah79: They should of created Mage Tower set for each class. Then everyone was on the same level!
[1:51:36] Mitchendo64: thats only true until you lose then you start looking at others first
[1:51:39] pavepawns: the purpose of the MT is its a challenge that you are supposed to challenge yourself and study the fights
[1:51:48] dranet11: imo if you cant do it you dont deserve it
[1:51:48] GombiG1: the problem was, on PtR it was ez, people saw the youtube videos that it's doable, they resubbed only for this and got hit in the face with hammer, that's the problem
[1:51:56] dranet11: its clearly doable with no special gear/consumes
[1:51:58] deeebag: wow does not need more LFR content
[1:52:05] GombiG1: i got the mount and made ton of gold, but still think it's not fair
[1:52:05] Udovar575: @TioMeko as a hunter main i found the fury challenge even easier than my main challenge... so idk, you have to get better because the fury challenge is literally the easiest challenge
[1:52:07] CodeMasterr: you can't study the fights if you are an average player and only can play a few hours a week
[1:52:22] elunesdruid: I saw the big picture and paused until 10.0
[1:52:25] Layliah79: It's easier on a sub level 60 toon then a level 60 toon too! Which shouldn't be a "thing."
[1:52:26] appa_____: its up till jan ... so why you hating it..it´s enough time to get it done!? or not?
[1:52:32] RiskyBusines_ez: so @Towelliee you want these challenges to be easier?
[1:52:36] falldrgn: 36/36 1 shot.. get at me bro.. content is easy.. (completly kidding)
[1:52:38] RiskyBusines_ez: so they appeal to every player?
[1:52:43] Mitchendo64: only 2 weeks til jan
[1:52:46] deeebag: @CodeMasterr no they are choosing not to.  you can watch a video while taking a shit wtf
[1:52:47] Gingerprimer: @RiskyBusines_ez yes
[1:52:49] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  so this is harder than the OLD mage tower?
[1:52:52] Udovar575: @Towelliee bad take tbh, not every game has to be casual friendly
[1:52:55] TioMeko: @Udovar575 I beat the hunter and holy paladin one and still can't do fury warrior which is my main
[1:52:55] chirsen: @CodeMasterr looking a guide is studying a fight? LUL
[1:52:58] zenity360: think what hurts it so bad is this was balanced around legendaries and an artifact weapon
[1:53:01] RiskyBusines_ez: and what about the more experienced players who seeks a challenge?
[1:53:08] RiskyBusines_ez: they can just do +30 or?
[1:53:23] HoaxDT: there isn't anything challenging about this if you can cheese it with older gear lol
[1:53:26] Udovar575: @TioMeko idk what to tell you, the fury challenge is literally on the number 1 or 2 spot for the easiest out there on every players list that i saw
[1:53:26] pavepawns: if they made MT too easy it would just be timewlaking dungeons. some free loot and then ignore for years
[1:53:27] sensei259: @codemasterr you can literally finish these in like an hour
[1:53:31] Udovar575: @TioMeko that is why i picked it up
[1:53:37] RiskyBusines_ez: yea but we're not talking about cheesing here
[1:53:41] RiskyBusines_ez: we're talking about the idea of mage tower
[1:53:50] TioMeko: @Udovar575 are you cheesing it with gear?
[1:53:52] nokiahanx: gear scaling. it was easier to kill kruul in green gear off the AH then my 252/246 gear on the bear. gear scaling is broken. level 50 greens don't get squished as hard.
[1:53:52] HoaxDT: no, we are talking about the current implementation of mage tower
[1:54:01] RiskyBusines_ez: and whats wrong with it?
[1:54:10] RiskyBusines_ez: why is challenging so bad
[1:54:26] Udovar575: @TioMeko my warrior is level 50 and has BFA world quest gear... only "cheese" i have is hearth of azeroth
[1:54:32] Ezekyler: lucky towOof
[1:54:37] Gingerprimer: Yeah Harcore players is not what keeps a game alive they are not important in the grand scheme of thigns if there wants/needs limits what "casuals" think is fun
[1:54:39] HoaxDT: the current implementation is bad. Scaling is off, current gear in sl is worse than older gear substantially. I'll repeat what i said before. if you want cosmetic challenge content, have an even starting point of a template set of gear.
[1:55:08] chirsen: @RiskyBusines_ez true, i needed 2 trys on my fire mage and 10-15 on my balance yesterday, and it was nice to obtain it in the end and not on first or second try
[1:55:12] TioMeko: @Udovar575 Wonder if it scales different. I am in most heroic SOD gear so i wonder if being lower level is giving the advantage
[1:55:14] Gingerprimer: Yeha a template would be optimal
[1:55:15] dranet11: @HoaxDT git gud
[1:55:25] RiskyBusines_ez: yea like i dont get it why its so bad
[1:55:40] HoaxDT: @dranet11 i have it on my mage already, did everything but arcane. Mage was very easy compared to others lol
[1:55:47] Udovar575: @TioMeko get the crusader enchant on both weapons
[1:55:47] elunesdruid: @dranet11 we all know u are a hero
[1:55:50] mcsploodge69: nice try
[1:55:52] Pippinn: Pippinn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! 46 lets go
[1:55:58] Udovar575: @TioMeko i heard that makes the fight easiest
[1:56:02] mcsploodge69: why was this easier back in the day?
[1:56:03] HoaxDT: too many variables with all the different gear combos
[1:56:03] TioMeko: @Udovar575 Thought they hotfixed that day 1
[1:56:07] zenity360: getting close
[1:56:15] Layliah79: Boomkin feels so weak w/o borrowed power in the tower
[1:56:20] Udovar575: @TioMeko they did, but it still helps you a LOT
[1:56:33] jerseyfive: just shows how crap some specs are *holy priest*
[1:56:34] TioMeko: @Udovar575 I'll have to test it out thanks bud
[1:56:48] binkz77: burstthaggist cause we could use borrowed powers
[1:56:55] Redshaman999: 2 people who play the game would be nice
[1:56:58] HoaxDT: we had all our borrowed power in legion lol
[1:57:01] chirsen: sephuz <3
[1:57:02] pavepawns: i dont mind template gear but id rather it stays at a high difficulty then constant nerfs
[1:57:05] Birder_L: strange it only got 2 days on the ptr
[1:57:05] appa_____: mybe outgeared back then?
[1:57:13] Mez42: I'm pretty sure, no one at Blizzard can remotely do the mage-tower content they released
[1:57:14] deeebag: it was easier at end of legion because you overpowered it
[1:57:15] Layliah79: We were at full capacity in Legion. Right now we're ripped up versions of ourselves
[1:57:16] HoaxDT: i want hard content, but i want an even playing field for class skill to shine and you be rewarded cosmetically for it
[1:57:16] ArcaneSyntax: you could also just straight up outgear it
[1:57:19] eyeztea: i got my mount and like the difficulty but wish there was easier one just for armor for people to get(i think 40% nerf should be about right)
[1:57:24] jerexify: jerexify subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:57:33] binkz77: you van out gear it in legion and we had borrowed powers
[1:57:38] deeebag: yes because end of legion it was faceroll
[1:57:39] Gillrad: then it was too easy
[1:57:49] LUKA_THIM: you should have tried to do that when it was released you are talking about late legion
[1:57:57] elunesdruid: blizzard offers a refund 24h from payment. I got the bear and took the chance :D
[1:58:01] Layliah79: It was solely a mechanic fight in Legion. Now it's that with how much gold can you spend & gear can you farm.
[1:58:29] HoaxDT: "bearly"
[1:58:31] LUKA_THIM: and on release you definitely needed bis legs and it was a legendary drought patch
[1:58:36] zenity360: prot paladin one was rough
[1:58:36] RiskyBusines_ez: @Layliah79 i did 4 of them with SL gear, was fine
[1:58:43] RiskyBusines_ez: havent tried the r est
[1:58:48] Layliah79: @RiskyBusines_ez which 4?
[1:58:59] 3663Sharad: He dead LUL
[1:59:01] KaisenSiru: Yeah I one shot enhancement with this current mage tower, but I'm also more familiar with the challenge after having done it on my Ret first. Assassination took me a bit more to get used to damage since its an alt
[1:59:02] AureliusXV: let velen die
[1:59:04] fistofnature: BibleThump
[1:59:05] Ezekyler: towF
[1:59:07] RiskyBusines_ez: @Layliah79 tank, bm, arms and fury
[1:59:09] TheRiwen: just make the scaling right
[1:59:11] AureliusXV: leave instance
[1:59:14] pavepawns: @Layliah79 you talk as if you cant do it with current gear. but you clearly can if you try your best and look over each fight carefully (like your supposed to)
[1:59:19] Streamcrush: do the wod heirloom trinkets still work in mage tower?
[1:59:32] Layliah79: @RiskyBusines_ez i'm close to tank one being done on bear 10%. just need to plan better going into last phase. Sometimes my overlaps suck lol
[1:59:33] Vyntage1: @Mez42 rofl... pretty sure you have no data to support that. Their "co-lead" has a 2500+ rio and Ion mythic raids...
[1:59:35] RiskyBusines_ez: but im sure the rest are doable with SL gear too, havent tried
[2:00:10] AureliusXV: did holy pally in sl gear, that was a cake walk compared to guardian
[2:00:20] retro_justice: anyone know if season of mastery is worth it rn?
[2:00:20] GombiG1: @AureliusXV yup, same here
[2:00:22] HoaxDT: @Layliah79 the problem with that is if there is the path of least effort that is available. why struggle with using your actual best gear for current content. If you can just spend money and get older gear to have an easier time. Where the challenge is removed
[2:00:24] Dentarthurdent73: You are so correct about thinking about the bigger picture here.. WoW is in a nosedive, this needed to be something that at least feels like it could be in reach for more average players, rather than just piss them off..
[2:00:29] wildheittv: I appreciate the level of difficulty, but I think putting everyone in a bare bones state when original MT  was not like that was a bad call. I say keep the level of difficulty but maybe unlock Legion Artifacts to ToS level or something.
[2:01:18] muichiroval: why dont u play necro its better
[2:01:19] Layliah79: Everyone has told me to use X Y Z gear. I never tired in my regular gear to be honest! Think i will after work now. Maybe that's my issue listening to other ppl.
[2:01:25] abracka_: @retro_justice if you want to play it, do it. there's people playing/leveling and doing end game content

[2:03:42] RiskyBusines_ez: I'm down with the template idea, but I dont really see an issue with the current mage tower. Sure its not a cakewalk for everyone, and thats totally cool. Some people may need more practice than others, and that is just life, thats how it is everywhere
[2:03:48] Tomaterrs: maybe torghast boss runs?

[2:04:40] Vyntage1: @Towelliee  Instead of immediate nerfs, remove the ability to only do mage tower over a 2-3 week period. The player base complains about content drought then cries when content takes time to complete.
[2:04:43] killswiitch: Yup
[2:04:52] Vyntage1: Imo of course
[2:04:57] RiskyBusines_ez: then why should that mindset not apply to mythic raiding as well?
[2:05:00] HoaxDT: if it was so meticulously scaled, i'd agree. practice. but it's not
[2:05:20] HoaxDT: @RiskyBusines_ez because other raid difficulties exist, and it's not cosmetic
[2:05:25] Mitchendo64: is fomo content really content though?
[2:05:35] Hregor: isnt crusader str?
[2:05:35] Schlong_John_Silva: didnt they hotfix crusader enchant?
[2:06:07] binkz77: I couldn't beat the guardian one until I put force multipler 9n my weapons
[2:06:09] HoaxDT: you're comparing to completely different areas of content @RiskyBusines_ez
[2:06:14] HoaxDT: *two
[2:06:24] vlatko211: this retail?
[2:06:29] KaisenSiru: It's nerfed, but still useful with a decent proc and heal, just not overly strong
[2:06:42] RiskyBusines_ez: yea i guess we just have different mindsets - some people like and enjoy a challenge, and the reward after hundreds of attempts - and some just wants to cakewalk through everything
[2:06:52] LUKA_THIM: in legion you had the luxury to use orbs in p1 now you dont thats stupid
[2:07:25] pavepawns: @BorpaLookingAtYou ye u do? the rule has always been save 1 orb for p2
[2:07:32] pavepawns: rest u can use
[2:07:36] sphynx_rayne: ohh that was close lol
[2:07:37] HoaxDT: again, you misunderstand. Challenge is fine, but don't throw in poorly scaled content and call it "challenging" and make it time-limited
[2:07:55] Jysser: i remember i did the brewmaster  challenge like 1 day after dinging to max level with some argus quest gear it was one of the easiest tank challenges
[2:07:55] KaisenSiru: Force Mutipliers and Dancing Steels are nice older enchants to use for sure. Sometimes for dual wielding classes I still used one Sinful Revelation
[2:08:00] binkz77: they should have let us use borrowed powers and there's no reason to nervous or people to complain
[2:08:09] LUKA_THIM: @pavepawns well i saved 5 orbs and did it that way
[2:08:27] pavepawns: holy fck thats alotta orbs
[2:08:38] RiskyBusines_ez: @HoaxDT so you just wanna talk to a guy and just get all the sets straight away or?
[2:08:48] HoaxDT: why are you putting words in my mouth lol
[2:08:56] Ignite_CLO: im sorry but do you have brain damage ? @RiskyBusines_ez
[2:09:05] RiskyBusines_ez: i just dont see where the border should be
[2:09:08] HoaxDT: i want gear templates, that are properly scaled for challenging content, and for people to be rewarded accordingly for that. not whatever this is
[2:09:11] RiskyBusines_ez: cuz again,. different opinions and mindset
[2:09:17] pavepawns: i didnt even know you could save 5 orbs for p2. ive only gone up to 2
[2:09:29] Douchecakes: @Towelliee use the Heirloom Hellscream's cleaver with vers gems.  Enchant one with Naga Hide. It give me crazy absorbs. I used Force Multiplier on the other weapon
[2:09:33] Stronku: getting close to a kill now
[2:09:54] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee you using demobane heirloom?
[2:10:23] Jokervenom1978: Good morning Towelliee and chat! Did i miss the Mayo stream?
[2:10:36] balancedlight: What emerald nightmare trinket?
[2:10:38] wildheittv: Are prepotting before going into the challenge?
[2:10:41] HoaxDT: I'm on the same page as you LMFAO, i want challenging content. this isn't it, it's poorly designed and untested. For all the reasons that have been discussed. I feel like you're just too dense to see past what you think is "good challenging content"
[2:10:44] balancedlight: i havent heard about it
[2:10:48] HoaxDT: @RiskyBusines_ez
[2:10:53] KaisenSiru: @balancedlight Seed Pod from the first boss
[2:11:05] pavepawns: its a clear in view kill just might take a few attempts
[2:11:06] TheHardcorian: Whats the emerald nightmare trinket called?
[2:11:21] JediNeo99999: You can pre-pot an unbridled fury pot before you start and get ~23 sec for the start
[2:11:23] RiskyBusines_ez: @HoaxDT  i mean sorry for having a different opinion than you lol
[2:11:26] NateEpicsaurus: i tryed aff lock challenge and only could make it to stage 3 until hand kills me aha
[2:11:29] HigameR4771: TwitchUnity LuvSign <3
[2:11:29] binkz77: revise sea pod
[2:11:35] Brodih_: Quebec like its mayo also
[2:11:36] falldrgn: Dukes>Craft
[2:11:38] Ignite_CLO: ravaged seed pod @TheHardcorian
[2:11:40] Miketolo71: from jersey hate mayo
[2:11:41] KaisenSiru: Ravaged Seed Pod
[2:11:42] sandymitchells: mayo in mac n cheese
[2:11:44] HoaxDT: @RiskyBusines_ez sure thing
[2:11:46] Khoulwhip: i prefer helman's
[2:11:47] Dentarthurdent73: i agree with you Hoax, I want good challenging content too - this isn't it. Original Mage Tower was it. But this feels really different
[2:12:02] im_billly: !ORIGIN
[2:12:05] DrWraithjr: All this mayo talk makes me want to eat a BLT LUL
[2:12:07] RiskyBusines_ez: i didnt do the old mage tower, was it harder or?
[2:12:08] TheHardcorian: @vashir_95 ty
[2:12:13] HoaxDT: @Dentarthurdent73 if our classes weren't so dependent on borrowed powers to feel complete lol
[2:12:14] Ignite_CLO: some people are better left of ignored @HoaxDT
[2:12:16] pavepawns: @RiskyBusines_ez again depends on fights
[2:12:22] HoaxDT: @RiskyBusines_ez you didn't do the original? lol...
[2:12:25] retro_justice: fries and mayo? grosssss
[2:12:27] pavepawns: fury in current version is insanely easy
[2:12:29] HoaxDT: so you really don't get it
[2:12:35] RiskyBusines_ez: @HoaxDT never said i did <3
[2:12:38] pavepawns: while old was a challenge
[2:12:38] Kisswani: Hi chat , Hi towelliee towHi
[2:12:40] WaikikiSmoke: side of mayo on fries should be a crime lol
[2:12:42] falldrgn: I looke at people who don't drink sweet tea
[2:12:48] falldrgn: funny
[2:13:05] Korupcija_: ok mayo with fries, calm down now
[2:13:05] retro_justice: @falldrgn from the southeast i assume
[2:13:06] Keyastaron_: keyastaron_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 2 month streak! you got this
[2:13:06] HoaxDT: @RiskyBusines_ez your holier than thou attitude made it seem like it XD
[2:13:07] DrWraithjr: I thought the mayo with fries was a Canadian thing
[2:13:07] deeebag: @RiskyBusines_ez it was roughly the same difficulty on relase, late expansion we were overgeared af and it was faceroll content
[2:13:21] Jokervenom1978: Mayo makes every sandwich better. towSip
[2:13:31] falldrgn: @falldrgn Yes sir.
[2:13:37] RiskyBusines_ez: @deeebag so it old MT was easier and thats what people are whining about?
[2:14:03] HoaxDT: @Towelliee you make your grilled cheeses the right way with a good spread of mayo on the outside when you fry them?
[2:14:03] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:14:04] pavepawns: old mt was outscaleable ppl are moaning you cant outscale current but you can minmax older stuff for it
[2:14:04] deeebag: @RiskyBusines_ez yes.  they remember end of legion MT when it was faceroll lol
[2:14:05] Talgarx: only tip I Can really give is try and save a couple more orbs for last phase
[2:14:07] retro_justice: down here in florida it's all orange juice and sweet tea
[2:14:33] RiskyBusines_ez: @HoaxDT i did BM, fury, arms, brew and almost SP in this MT, no clue how they were in original
[2:14:34] Dentarthurdent73: it's not that it was easier as such, but it was tested, and we didn't have abilities removed, so didn't feel as crippled as this one
[2:14:54] Dentarthurdent73: but mainly, yeah, it was tested, and it worked with the artifact weapons and specs we had then
[2:15:06] mrz_as: FeelsBadMan
[2:15:13] pavepawns: @RiskyBusines_ez oh those fights only hard one originally would be fury. while arms was dependent on legendaries abit on how easy it was
[2:15:20] pavepawns: of*
[2:15:35] retro_justice: chick fil a dipping sauce + grilled cheese
[2:15:37] Brodih_: onion soup
[2:15:43] Miketolo71: Have you ever checked out Steves grilled cheese @Towelliee
[2:15:46] Sollice: No you put the mayo on the outside instead of butter and use that as your butter/oil
[2:15:47] HoaxDT: @Towelliee nah, i mean instead of butter on the outside when you fry them in the pan. you spread it on the outside. you get some next level crust
[2:15:49] Arvidian: slather the mayo on the bread instead of butter to cook the grilled cheese. glorious!
[2:15:50] Ignite_CLO: also for the old mage tower you needed currency to enter remember LUL
[2:15:52] DrWraithjr: tomato soup with grilled cheese is where it is at!
[2:15:58] Kisswani: oh , is the sponsored stream on ? or not yet ?
[2:16:01] falldrgn: Ive always done butter.. on grilled cheese
[2:16:06] r0b928: He’s saying use mayo instead of butter 🧈
[2:16:25] retro_justice: apparently some ppl put mayo on hot dogs??

[2:19:28] Malarick: so you say you like mayo
[2:19:52] kashmara: hot dog with chili and cheese is A+ tho
[2:20:39] Jokervenom1978: Chicago-style hot dogs are underrated imo.
[2:20:40] Quojin: i wonder how much protein is in mayo
[2:20:40] RiskyBusines_ez: i mean you're not casting chi wave, no wonder it doesnt do anything ;D
[2:20:59] fewyn: i want to make some deviled eggs right now for some reason

[2:57:28] SaDos: @Towelliee arent the dcs because of addons?
[2:57:56] gooni_coyg: !ui

[2:58:35] FranciscoTheMage: max who?

[2:58:46] SocioPET: The worst abiut the ff14 queue is it doesn't even show an indicator of time
[2:58:55] psycho_scythe: !wow
[2:58:55] Moobot: @psycho_scythe Towelliee is not playing WoW for the time being. Maybe sometime in the future until then, FFXIV, SWTOR, Battlefield 2042 and New World will be holding us over.
[2:59:11] sniffsc: I think its common in streamers, you dont really liek the game but its part of your job

[3:00:40] FranciscoTheMage: Asmon is not fine... by no means

[3:05:31] FranciscoTheMage: or its the "woe is me" twitter rant complex many streamers seem to have these days .. complain complain complain.
[3:06:22] Revelations45: Yes its not like wow at all lol

[3:07:15] Kisswani: I felt that Naguura was surprised at the FFXIV launch experience
[3:08:17] Aidler: @kisswani she didn’t get the Towelliee advice
[3:08:34] whisperlude: its a single player game in a way
[3:08:45] Korupcija_: would you say it's a channel killer?
[3:09:01] Kisswani: @Aidler naguuraBless true

[3:10:49] TheRiwen: It destroys the game if you see the story in ff14
[3:10:58] SaDos: @Towelliee what is the difference in playing the story yourself and watching someone else play it? The story remains the fucking same
[3:11:08] SaDos: you cant influence it
[3:11:12] Molvonos: @SaDos You don't play FF, clearly, lol.
[3:11:36] FranciscoTheMage: are these all big FF streamers? i dont know some of these names

[3:12:18] Kisswani: @SaDos never thought of it that way tbh . I guess because the story is the same for everyone it might make sense
[3:12:29] SaDos: @TheRiwen how is it different?
[3:12:34] Molvonos: @whisperlude Yep.  And your personal character and what they've done influences how  the scenes play out.  It's hella involved
[3:12:35] masenka_: Feb 2023?
[3:12:39] CallMeWallie: I mainly watch twitch to get caught up

[3:55:57] Colt_Engineer: old age catching up with him
[3:56:04] Vashthalas: @Towelliee if you have archeology, you can also go get the prizerock neckband from the weekly quest. It has 3 sockets and bis for timewalking

[4:00:37] xPilsn: it was over 300k couple weeks ago
