[5:08:46] Picofire: @exyl1 it's ok, Blizz is a small indie company, no budget to fix bugs
[5:08:49] heyshanna: its not a bug @exyl1, if they don't want snap spots they should have different dungeon design
[5:08:53] ghostgalx: who's leading?
[5:09:05] ReloadedCS: you realize that with literally everything there is a "optimal way" of doing it, how often do you see sprinters use different techniques? @swapnilsathe1

[5:09:25] tohappen: @swapnilsathe1 not true, there are slight adjustments, like unholy dks see some play here and there. But you gotta use the very best comp to be able to do this content at maximum efficiency
[5:09:26] Lyonidus: imo
[5:09:27] MogdaEU: Jb choke soon
[5:09:27] Picofire: @darrie it IS a bug. The mobs used to just evade, not teleport

[5:09:36] Kuroth: I mean snap locations are working exactly as intended. They were designed to work exactly how they actually do. They just feel janky, but it's not really a bug.
[5:09:40] webbeffect: @swapnilsathe1 there isn’t only one comp thats good, it’s the fact that they’re min/maximg everything
