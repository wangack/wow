[2:03:39] iduckbro: Okayge
[2:03:40] Rauusse: corruption > agony
[2:03:40] Blaple1: agoni is worthless
[2:03:41] powerferno1: Agony is good for leveling
[2:03:42] 香港: yes, better
[2:03:42] Cosbert: Agony takes too long to ramp for leveling, imo
[2:03:42] Xtreck: max corruption
[2:03:43] Skirnyrr: agony is too slow for leveling
[2:03:43] stannojj: yeah
[2:03:44] Vastatio: no 5/5 corruption
[2:03:45] tacabbanda: @zhyren you do that in solo altready
[2:03:46] falfr: things dont last long enough for agony damage to matter as much

[2:03:49] Goryuka: no no no. you should just reroll a more fun class monkerS
[2:03:49] gayforcandy: spell power kinda negates a need for imp life tap thats more for raid parsing, corruption + hit + life drain soul drain
[2:03:49] fighead1: ye

[2:03:52] balouis: Agony has no time to ramp
[2:03:53] Joeyzoom: Just look at icy-veins
[2:03:54] Omega2k3: improved drain soul is better than syphon for leveling and pve and corruption is better than agony
[2:03:54] Mootins: Agony has such a slow build up on the dot DMG
[2:03:54] MoneyMyk: why warlock?
[2:03:55] sorenmills: @sodapoppin corruption is the most damaging spell
[2:03:55] GOMCIO: @sodapoppin Corruption instead of agony, cuz agony also works as siphon life
[2:03:55] PutMeInCoachPls: most of your dot damage should come from corruption @sodapoppin <
[2:03:55] Mend0: Bark

[2:05:40] shimengo: you are not doting aoe pulls
[2:05:40] goodmentalhaver: 80% of agonys damage is the last 2 ticks so if it doesnt go full duration its not worth using

[2:05:46] ractorxa: most of agony dmg is at the end of duration but mobs wont live that long
[2:05:46] Fnjaf: but agony does very little damage if mobs die fast
[2:05:47] ERIZEL: try it, could be good in your case
[2:05:48] Znza: @ivyspoison lifetap lmao
