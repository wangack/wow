[0:09:48] Spyke_ZGZ: I ain't going nowhere
[0:09:49] DrunkenHorror: @FaeyeLinn MCGangbang
[0:10:52] Spyke_ZGZ: So this company gives me $50 a month towards my internet apparently
[0:10:55] Spyke_ZGZ: That's fucking dope.
[0:11:00] FaeyeLinn: @DrunkenHorror There we go. Do that but with quarter pound patties from a nice place and a spicy chicken sandwich from Chick Fil'A.
[0:11:10] DrunkenHorror: yes
[0:12:02] DrunkenHorror: yes ó €€
[0:12:11] FaeyeLinn: That is normal.
[0:12:17] aginsb: yes, but also each timeline has a wp you can take if you've unlocked it
[0:12:29] FaeyeLinn: It's fucking irritating, but it's normal.
[0:12:32] DrunkenHorror: have you been doing prophacies at all through the  circle of fortune?
[0:13:31] DrunkenHorror: im not 100% sure there in single player (think they are tho)
[0:13:53] cajuncanuck: remember the place with the telescopes and lenses you needed to buy
[0:14:13] cajuncanuck: also, just hit Y
[0:14:21] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers they are bonus MF
[0:14:52] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers yea you can "buy them" and they give targeted rewards once u do what they tell you to do
[0:15:18] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers one i have right now gives 4 exalted bows once i run the arena
[0:15:21] Tinit5190: So yesterday I went shopping before this winter storm. Picked up everything for taco's but forgot the god damn cheese on the till. FML
[0:15:42] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers yea i have one thats beat a specific mono boss and i get 2 legendaries
[0:15:47] DrunkenHorror: err uniques
[0:18:22] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers unless things changed 90% of mage builds are "pick your main dps skill and all other skills are build to buff you/that skill"
[0:18:23] Tinit5190: No fucken way am I going out. We got 9 inches of snow lmao
[0:18:39] DrunkenHorror: that build might not work without the spoon,  that wep is realy strong for what it does
[0:19:03] Tinit5190: Almost taller than my dog lol
[0:19:13] DoubleXL_ZgZ: snow? it that   like rain, but cold?
[0:20:12] Tinit5190: what kind of runemaster are you goin?
[0:21:01] drewbullx: build guides KEKLEO
[0:21:28] Tinit5190: Problem is you need uniques for most GG ones
[0:21:36] DrunkenHorror: very easy
[0:21:51] Tinit5190: maxroll build guides have loot filters
[0:22:43] Tinit5190: click build guies and search nova
[0:23:17] Tinit5190: That one needs "Ashen Crown" but who knows if there's starter builds
[0:23:29] reborndevil96: channeled playstyle
[0:23:59] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers it will take you maybe 15 min to set up a loot filter IMO,
[0:24:24] DrunkenHorror: very intuitive and easy to make a early game one in game
[0:24:50] DrunkenHorror: not grab and endgame one
[0:24:59] DrunkenHorror: just make one in gameits super easy
[0:25:04] reborndevil96: like what are you looking to build into, whats your main damage spread and secondary damage spread
[0:25:05] StreamElements: zeegerLove Spyke just tipped $3.00 zeegerPog
[0:25:22] drewbullx: Clap
[0:25:41] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers shift F
[0:25:53] Spyke_ZGZ: Yeah go to lastepochtools.com
[0:25:59] Spyke_ZGZ: And look for an Import Code
[0:26:00] Spyke_ZGZ: ggwp
[0:26:31] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers higher list=higher prio,  so you want "hide all rares"  at the verry bottom
[0:27:23] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers hide al lrare/magic/white as the bottom 3
[0:27:52] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  you can set these in the same rule set
[0:28:17] scotty_zgz: !gamble all
[0:28:18] StreamElements: zeegerGitgud scotty_zgz went all in and lost every single one of their 1248 Points zeegerRIP
[0:28:24] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers youre going to make a rule higher up that tells it to show you what you want to see
[0:28:36] drewbullx: select multiple in properties tab?
[0:29:20] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers show affix's
[0:29:45] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers now select all the GOOD affex's for your build
[0:29:49] reborndevil96: what affix's are you aiming to get on your gear should be what your looking for
[0:31:04] DrunkenHorror: general as well
[0:31:22] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers the weird chests that drop items
[0:31:33] DrunkenHorror: with a personal affix on them
[0:31:51] Tinit5190: This still offline?
[0:31:52] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers go up to attrabuttes
[0:32:21] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers attunement is a different stat for druids
[0:32:27] Spyke_ZGZ: Attunement is a stat point that gives you Mana
[0:32:31] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers i think it only gives sorc max mana
[0:32:32] Spyke_ZGZ: Think Energy from D2
[0:32:38] FaeyeLinn: Attunement is essentially Wisdom.
[0:32:59] Spyke_ZGZ: Yeah it's a Blessing of Wisdom that lasts longer than 5 minutes
[0:33:03] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers no
[0:33:16] aginsb: s one of the main stats, but its not the main stat your class scales with
[0:33:22] Spyke_ZGZ: Attunement is one of the Character Stats which grants 2 mana per point and improves skills that rely on innate magic inside the character and its surroundings.
[0:33:23] drewbullx: I don't go anywhere without Blessing of Wisdom
[0:33:26] aginsb: there are still some benefits to it, but you want into
[0:33:29] aginsb: *int
[0:33:33] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers umm
[0:33:48] DrunkenHorror: click the drop down for health recovery
[0:33:52] FaeyeLinn: Attunement empowers spells that have the Attunement tag. It's essentially just a main stat, and mage doesn't use it primarily, but you can use it in your gear to improve your mana total. This isn't recommended because of the opportunity cost.
[0:34:13] Spyke_ZGZ: @FaeyeLinn This is the explanation you wanted
[0:34:42] DrunkenHorror: ill show u after this
[0:34:46] Spyke_ZGZ: 1 Attunement = 2 mana
[0:34:54] aginsb: yeah, like strength or int or dex
[0:34:56] DrunkenHorror: if ur good on that hit confirm
[0:35:09] DrunkenHorror: now the dropdown
[0:35:12] DrunkenHorror: "with atleast"
[0:35:17] aginsb: str gives armor for example, but if youre not a str build, its not worth getting str for armor most of the time
[0:35:29] irfinky: 2
[0:35:33] DrunkenHorror: ide do  2
[0:35:38] DrunkenHorror: then make it change color
[0:35:48] DrunkenHorror: and do another with 3 and have it be a different color as well
[0:35:55] irfinky: make a different rule for 3 or 4 afficxes to highlight them more
[0:36:15] drewbullx: visibility tab
[0:36:35] drewbullx: everything purple EZ
[0:36:42] irfinky: yellowish
[0:36:43] DrunkenHorror: whatever catches your eye
[0:36:54] aginsb: dont use purple because thats exaulted items
[0:37:03] DrunkenHorror: then copy that rule and change it to 3-  set a diff color, 4 third color ect
[0:37:11] irfinky: purple is used for exhalted
[0:37:15] irfinky: and red is used for legendary
[0:37:16] DrunkenHorror: yea
[0:37:43] drewbullx: 5Head
[0:37:47] irfinky: zeegerThumbsup
[0:37:50] JotsAwn: you can always use the "emphasize" check box which lets you reuse colors
[0:37:52] drewbullx: he's learning
[0:37:56] irfinky: big brain
[0:38:02] drewbullx: rofl
[0:38:06] drewbullx: yes!
[0:38:07] zaz_D: can you choose seethrough colour?
[0:38:42] reborndevil96: you were going Runemaster path right?
[0:38:44] drewbullx: they said one more for 4 affixes
[0:38:50] SavedEight_ZGZ: omg is that thee zeegers?! would you sign my zeegers hat, mug, shirt hoodie AND my wiener shirt?
[0:38:52] Cobra_ZGZ: Building blox
[0:39:02] drewbullx: cobra zeegerPog
[0:39:07] Cobra_ZGZ: Drew!
[0:39:12] drewbullx: @SavedEight_ZGZ that's a lot of loot EZ
[0:39:18] Cobra_ZGZ: @savedeight_zgz no, this is chatgpt zeegers
[0:39:40] reborndevil96: runemaster path right?
[0:39:44] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  this way u still see all unique and purples for other builds but you should stop seeing all the random garbage
[0:39:48] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Cobra_ZGZ LUL LUL
[0:39:56] Cobra_ZGZ: Entertainer WorldWide
[0:39:58] SavedEight_ZGZ: @drewbullx farming hell zeegers chaos, super juiced loot bro

[0:40:43] DrunkenHorror: yea,  once ur out hit C
[0:41:05] DrunkenHorror: you can hover attunement to see what it gives your class
[0:41:16] Cobra_ZGZ: 6 str.... wtf
[0:41:27] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers when you hover over a skill
[0:41:33] aginsb: yes
[0:41:35] DrunkenHorror: exactly
[0:41:44] aginsb: yours all say int
[0:41:56] ratllero: Hi Zeeg
[0:42:12] DrunkenHorror: i THINK acolite uses it on some and druid or primalist w/e its called uses attune
[0:42:37] DrunkenHorror: most of my casterbuilds used fireball as the primary but i dont like elemental nova
[0:42:45] ratllero: SeemsGood
[0:42:51] Spyke_ZGZ: Hey @Zeegers this product I'm learning to take over is just WordPress so how do I pretend like I'm learning shit I've known for 20 years?
[0:42:54] reborndevil96: i can leave a couple guides that i had already worked on in the past in the discord if you want
[0:43:07] DrunkenHorror: its realy strong early but falls off around 60-70 IMO
[0:43:14] Spyke_ZGZ: Full circle
[0:43:34] DrunkenHorror: but idk about runemaster,  havnt tried it at all maybe it makes nova better
[0:43:39] reborndevil96: i was working on every variant of mage before runemaster so it might not help you but it can help others
[0:43:43] hyldster_zgz: Yo bros

[0:54:19] FaeyeLinn: Holy shit.
[0:54:31] reborndevil96: oh well
[0:54:35] DrunkenHorror: fml just spent like 30 min making an endgame filter and the dog hit the power button ... riiip lol
[0:54:37] yoplayyoggie: damn
[0:55:14] primal_drop: I feel like i just gebaited him
[0:55:21] aginsb: well, at a certain point the math would work out for you to buy your own gifted subs if you were close, right?
[0:55:24] primal_drop: alley oop and DUNK subs!~
[0:56:34] aginsb: just a lot more work to do that
[0:56:54] reborndevil96: your welcome
[0:57:23] DrunkenHorror: devine era
[0:57:25] reborndevil96: even if i dont tune in everday i still would like the people that i support to make it big
[0:57:34] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers devine bottom left corner
[0:57:42] aginsb: you block it, but in the bottom left of the map it will tell you if you have unlocked all the passives and idol slots
[0:57:58] aginsb: not all, but some are important
[0:57:59] JotsAwn: no
[0:58:05] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers in the bottom left corner does it say u have all idol slots and all attrabutes?
[0:58:09] JotsAwn: just enough to get all your passive points and idosl
[0:58:18] JotsAwn: that's right
[0:58:20] aginsb: yeah, you did all the ones that matter then
[0:58:28] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers no point to do any,  even if the side quest sais it will give attrabutes or slots it wont since u have them all
[0:58:49] reborndevil96: diablo is basically dead
[0:58:56] zaz_D: i just watch you for the shoulders
[0:59:50] DrunkenHorror: not him
[0:59:54] DrunkenHorror: telescope
[1:00:08] aginsb: were there lenses you wanted to buy?
[1:00:12] aginsb: because then yeah the first person
[1:00:21] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  once you buy one node it removes the rest from THAT constilation
[1:00:34] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers find a reward u like and buy it
[1:01:00] aginsb: no, it will mean that prophecies wont roll with that condition
[1:01:00] DrunkenHorror: i havnt played with the lenses at all
[1:01:06] aginsb: it does not remove it from a given prophecy
[1:01:26] aginsb: it may reroll when you put in the lense, I dont remember
[1:01:41] aginsb: but getting a lense that makes keeps your prophecies out of campaign events is a decent way to start
[1:01:59] DrunkenHorror: depends on build,  IMO exalted wep is biggest power spike unless you need a specific unique for your build
[1:02:09] aginsb: I targeted Idols first because my build had build defining ones that I needed. but then yeah I'd focus on a unique weapon I was target farming
[1:02:29] DrunkenHorror: umm
[1:02:33] aginsb: is there a scepter you want? probably not
[1:02:37] DrunkenHorror: i dont think the spoon is a sceptre
[1:02:38] aginsb: you probably want a staff or a wand, right?
[1:02:52] DrunkenHorror: prolly not mage is usualy wand/staff
[1:03:00] DrunkenHorror: sceptre is usualy acolite i think
[1:03:15] DrunkenHorror: the telescope can look at all
[1:03:32] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers NESW iis cycleing between the telescopes
[1:03:39] aginsb: if you click the arrows, you dont need to go to the different telescopes
[1:03:48] irfinky: each telescope is N E S W
[1:04:40] FaeyeLinn: ALL weapons are viable. You choose the weapon type based on what BASE it gives. For instance, runemaster can make it so that a certain portion of melee damage on your weapon is converted to other stats. That makes staff good because staff is spell damage / melee damage base. Some give crit, some give mana regen, some give ward, etc... you need to choose your weapon based on the basic stats it gives and go from there.
[1:04:49] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers if you buy one it rerolles the rest of THAT constilation so you can only pick one
[1:04:52] aginsb: hard to target farm when you dont know what you are targeting
[1:05:16] DrunkenHorror: i would look for exalted items then
[1:05:29] aginsb: then maybe get exalted prophecies because you get more opportunities for good drops
[1:05:35] aginsb: there were just 2 there
[1:05:38] DrunkenHorror: u just saw exalted wands
[1:05:43] DrunkenHorror: click on east
[1:06:12] aginsb: go for it
[1:06:37] aginsb: yes, you can have up to 48
[1:06:53] DrunkenHorror: most of the time exalted>unique,  unless you need a specific unique for a build to work
[1:07:00] aginsb: the other cool thing about those exalted items, is that they can proc the cof level 2 perk as well
[1:07:27] aginsb: thats only if they have legendary potential
[1:07:36] DrunkenHorror: one of the endgame dungeons
[1:07:38] aginsb: to upgrade there is a rune of ascendence
[1:07:50] aginsb: but I dont think thats what you are talking about
[1:08:12] DrunkenHorror: you can also use a rune of ascendence that turns an item into a random legendary of that base
[1:08:25] aginsb: are you talking about turning an exaulted into a unique or slamming an exaulted into a unique to make a legendary?
[1:09:01] irfinky: you cant
[1:09:02] aginsb: no
[1:09:04] DrunkenHorror: you dont
[1:09:06] aginsb: yes you do
[1:09:13] aginsb: chat is wrong
[1:09:19] aginsb: you can use a rune of ascendence
[1:09:27] JotsAwn: no, there is a "rune of ascendance" where you can turn ANY item into a random unique
[1:09:30] DrunkenHorror: thats not what hes talking about aginsb
[1:09:38] JotsAwn: no
[1:09:42] irfinky: rune of ascendence is for bases, not exhaalted
[1:09:45] JotsAwn: the rune is used at your normal forge
[1:09:54] aginsb: the rune is a totally different thing
[1:09:58] DrunkenHorror: rune of ascendence is a gamba rune,  it destroied the base item and gives you a legendary of the same base
[1:10:21] irfinky: correct
[1:10:27] DrunkenHorror: the legendary thing is a FUSION of an exalted+unique (with LP)
[1:10:39] irfinky: you can only slam an exalted with a unique
[1:10:47] DrunkenHorror: yea
[1:10:54] aginsb: what do you mean by "turn an exaulted into a unique"
[1:10:57] JotsAwn: if you mean you keep the stats on the exalted but turn it into a unique, you can't.
[1:11:03] aginsb: why are people saying you cant. thats what the rune is doing
[1:11:14] aginsb: unique and legendary are different things
[1:11:55] aginsb: the rune turns an exaulted into a random unique of the same item type
[1:12:01] irfinky: Yes
[1:12:05] JotsAwn: for now, use a good wand
[1:12:08] DrunkenHorror: exalteds are "best"  because  you can have more affix's than a legendary with hhigher stat totals.   most endgame builds is like 1 legendary + all purples ...    if a build requires 8 different legendaries its usualy a MEME and bad
[1:12:27] JotsAwn: slamming is a real niche thing.  The unique needs to be good for you first, legendary potential is just a bonus
[1:12:42] aginsb: it picks random affixes, the number equal to the legendary potential
[1:12:43] scotty_zgz: !gamble all<
[1:12:43] your_friend_tim: Sean, we need to talk.
[1:12:46] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  if a legendary had 3 LP it will steal 3 RANDOM affix's from the exalted
[1:12:59] aginsb: so a lp3 unique will get 3 of the 4 affixes from the exaulted
[1:13:02] DrunkenHorror: !slots all
[1:13:02] StreamElements: @DrunkenHorror you got zeegerJuice | zeegerBELL | zeegerJuice and lost your 1008 Points zeegerRIP
[1:13:03] your_friend_tim: that too
[1:13:03] aginsb: but still randomly 3
[1:13:11] aginsb: yeah
[1:13:15] DrunkenHorror: sorry if a unique had 3 LP
[1:13:17] DrunkenHorror: yea
[1:13:23] your_friend_tim: I turned down a steak for lunch. and it has me in shambles.
[1:13:32] scotty_zgz: cest rare que ca va pas ben quand tes en conger
[1:13:33] irfinky: generally only go for exalted gear unles you build specifically  NEEDS a unique. then consider slamming
[1:13:40] scotty_zgz: a part la paye qui est plus ptite ahah
[1:13:51] scotty_zgz: LOL wrong chatr
[1:14:09] aginsb: spending your favor helps you rank up your faction so you want to be spending it
[1:14:11] your_friend_tim: I had a huge breakfast buffet, and I justâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what to do with my life right now
[1:14:14] your_friend_tim: WHO WAS
[1:14:22] your_friend_tim: BACK OFF SCOTTY
[1:14:36] your_friend_tim: SCOTTY DOESNT KNOW YOURE MINE
[1:14:52] your_friend_tim: Yes
[1:15:12] JotsAwn: a big thing about legendary potential to know, LP1-4 have different probabilities on EACH ITEM.  Some you may never find a LP 3 or 4.  If a unique isn't good for your build outside of LP, you typically won't use it
[1:15:47] DrunkenHorror: im a loot whore so i like uniques.  but i also know that its usualy bad
[1:15:51] JotsAwn: I find exalteds to be waaaay more beneificial than uniques
[1:15:56] irfinky: exhalted, and target farm specific uniques. if you know what unique you need
[1:15:57] aginsb: it depends on the stage, but without having a build in mind I would target exaulteds
[1:16:05] aginsb: I would only target uniques if I am looking for a specific one
[1:16:07] JotsAwn: but target farming uniques is def a good call if you know what you want/need
[1:16:23] DrunkenHorror: there are some uniques that make MEME builds possable and i like that... if you only plan on rolling 1 character than its exalted 95% of the time
[1:16:43] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers in 300hours ive seen ONE LP4
[1:16:46] aginsb: pretty sure lp maxes out at 3 so theres always some risk
[1:16:50] aginsb: oh, nevermind

[1:22:46] Spyke_ZGZ: @Spyke_ZGZ My manager told me to go watch some video trainings. He didn't say it couldn't be Zeegers' training on Last Epoch.

[1:27:47] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: dude the builds are honest;ly end;ess
[1:27:51] JotsAwn: PoE = analysis paralysis
[1:28:00] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: L
[1:28:02] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  this is like half way between d2 and poe IMO ..
[1:28:36] Spyke_ZGZ: PoE's linking system and how the skills work is honestly a college level class in itself.
[1:29:15] Convoak: Itâ€™s ackshually quite simple Spyke
[1:29:36] JotsAwn: how much movespeed do you have on your boots?  If you get rune's of ascendance, i might spend them on boots first if you move is low
[1:29:43] Convoak: Me and Laggy been playing duos/trios with Summy every night past 2 weeks I think.
[1:29:52] Convoak: WoW just not as sweaty for me. sadly
[1:30:08] StreamElements: Link to my YouTube Page, HIT THAT SUB BUTTON!! - https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeegersTV
[1:30:12] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: holding the x key also disables the filter letting go enables it
[1:30:15] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers you can set it to hide specific bases but i would wait untill u have more aff'x's
[1:30:23] JotsAwn: You could do a filter at the top that hides all items you won't use
[1:30:25] aginsb: do you want to be able to shatter them for the crafting mats?
[1:30:44] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers when u shater an item you get shards based off their affix's
[1:30:50] aginsb: yes
[1:30:51] DrunkenHorror: yup
[1:31:01] DrunkenHorror: put it in the forge and use rune of shater
[1:31:01] aginsb: hit f
[1:31:08] aginsb: then you'll see a rune of shattering
[1:31:19] aginsb: put the item in there
[1:31:21] DrunkenHorror: drag item in
[1:31:23] aginsb: then click the plus
[1:31:37] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers yup
[1:31:49] aginsb: yes,the first rune, the one you have 17 of
[1:31:51] JotsAwn: top left
[1:31:51] DrunkenHorror: top of screen
[1:31:53] DrunkenHorror: first row

[1:32:19] aginsb: not all, some its a bit random but yeah
[1:32:22] JotsAwn: you get a chance to pull each.  Not guaranteed
[1:32:24] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  you get some of the shards back,   tier 4 affix can give upto 4 shards but wont always
[1:32:34] aginsb: and you can also buy those from the vendors
[1:32:34] DrunkenHorror: always kills the item but # of shards is a roll
[1:32:46] aginsb: its a real easy way to get crafting mats
[1:33:01] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: yeah i was told leveling u want top buy all the shatters u see

[1:34:53] Bewts: Up to about lvl 80
[1:35:26] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers  theres also a scroll that removes a single random affix.  if u get a good 3/4 item sometimes its worth trying to get lucky and removing the bad affix ( usualy with purples)
[1:36:44] Spyke_ZGZ: I love working for companies that have always been remote. They're just very "hands off" from day 1.
[1:37:01] Spyke_ZGZ: I'm expected to manage my own time and get my own stuff done. Precisely how I like it.

[1:41:35] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers alot of builds will use boots + belt to fill all defencive requirements so neither of those pieces have  main stat.    each build has thresholds (max resist,  max crit avoid,   minimum hp amount ECT)  and those are alot more important than having  int on all gear,   its worth giving up 1 slot to hit the threshhold

[2:21:00] Tinit5190: D4 has the problem that the boss mechanics are mostly one shot when you are at level

[2:49:43] aginsb: 20 + your items
[2:56:37] aginsb: theres a reason the most hard core players tend to also be the excel users
[2:57:14] aginsb: and why many of the rest of us follow their guides
[2:58:16] Wombatt_ZGZ: that's a gripe I have with WoW, too.  Nobody tells you how to play a new class that doesn't have the current tier set
[2:58:24] malis1: The build I am using says it NEEDS a certain unique then the leveling guide for the class is the same build just without that unique
[3:00:04] Wombatt_ZGZ: The guides all assume that you have the current 4-set
[3:00:19] Wombatt_ZGZ: if you don't, and you follow the rotation guidance they give, you're gonna be way off
[3:00:37] Wombatt_ZGZ: some are wildly different
[3:01:00] Topher_IRL: Enh Shaman was like that at some points, depending on the gear you had different prios
[3:01:01] Wombatt_ZGZ: tier sets in S2 and S3 are WAY different than they were in S1 though
[3:01:08] Wombatt_ZGZ: it does now

[3:02:43] Wombatt_ZGZ: leveling, you play a wildfire type build, because you have no tier.  then last tier, you abandoned ALL of that and ONLY focused on the lightning side.  This season, that all got abandoned and it's only the fire side
[3:02:57] Topher_IRL: @GNR_SweetSkills I hope you made up for those calories with lots of delicious fried things on a stick

[3:17:54] aginsb: tbh that makes sense. if you are using a service to move gold between games, theres a good chance the gold you get is not legitimate

[3:18:30] Spyke_ZGZ: A little?
[3:18:57] aginsb: sure, but theres a decent person your trade partner is not getting their gold legitimately
[3:19:07] aginsb: exactly. and thats what this guy said
[3:19:15] TommyVercetii: hi
[3:19:23] Topher_IRL: You literally can't trade ANYTHING with ANYONE and guarantee it didn't come from a legit source unless you watched it drop
[3:19:43] TommyVercetii: being responsible for both parties seems odd given that how you could ever check
[3:19:43] Spyke_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL Oh, this statement is very intentionally worded.
[3:19:44] Topher_IRL: I said that same thing about D2JSP
[3:19:55] aginsb: @Topher_IRL and thats why this guy didn;t say anything more concrete than "if you know the person you're taking less risk"
