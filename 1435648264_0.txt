[0:56:24] hutch135: @cavalore69xv I'd say its a pretty good comparison. It's a little more casual in some ways cos the games are relatively short (45-60mins usually). Good fun tho
[0:56:25] thomaspirine: C
[0:56:26] MysticHate: 3090 seems to handle it though

[1:00:06] Operator_Parry: oh shit this map looks completely different
[1:00:07] PerseusLive_: @0DiNsc Not true, the problem is, people just dont understand how to realistically play as a marksman and actually be usefull for the team..
[1:00:10] xG3ne: @decimusvictor I am pretty sure you dont have over 100h in this game
[1:00:16] wiLySLoth: its a reasonable question
[1:00:20] Lynchiii: @sart0ris 100% true

[1:00:41] jacksmasskiwi: WHwhat are they building and why
[1:00:42] vitas360: @PerseusLive_ to each their own and i respect people that try to play the role tactically, i guess as a SL main i always want something to deal with armor as that can destroy our entire squad. i couldve been a bit harsh there
[1:00:45] xG3ne: Squad is not a running simulator, it is only that if your squadleaders are bad or you play lone-wolf
[1:00:46] itschris_k: I actually love this game! Why are you playing now? Did it get a new update?
[1:00:48] Verdant_Wave: Garden destroyed. No crunchy water for you!
[1:00:49] FireBlade: @thisgameisboring2 it's a good thing nobody is forcing you to watch then huh

[1:00:57] eeejaaay: You guys have to speak Russian for the immersion
[1:00:59] Sonbeem: marksman is supposed to be as quiet as possible and only strike when it opens opportunity

[1:01:46] Operator_Parry: this map looks so much better now Kreygasm
[1:01:48] vitas360: @sampsony ya maybe join one of the clans and do in house events, it can be hit or miss but mostly good vibes. its nice to play a social game and just hear some people ya know
[1:01:52] ProtooStar: monkaHmm
[1:01:53] atanasiu: shroud I feel like the sniper in the game doesn't beat much 😂😂 compared to tarkov
[1:01:54] jcjoeyfreak: shroudM
[1:01:54] ramiresmok: monkaW
[1:01:56] ImBjuna: @xG3ne i can tell you have no experience in real life because thats exactly what snipers do. they arent meant to be in combat they are an intelligence asset that scouts and removes HVT
[1:01:58] PerseusLive_: @0DiNsc Look, not trying to make a fool out of you, but I bet that even you as an SL dont know how to use this asset efficiently. Am I right? Little people do, to be honest :P
[1:01:59] Varec11: monkaW where?

[1:02:29] atanasiu: this game scopr is not god no range
[1:02:32] dfsgagsgagsgfggshhss: @decimusvictor i'd say that's pretty reductive because they do a fair bit of shooting people too
[1:02:33] Verdant_Wave: kaitiacChicken

[1:02:35] cheka_: a silencer maybe
[1:02:36] Operator_Parry: if you're a good marksman it can be good
[1:02:36] junjun9_: whenever i play this game i can never be a sniper. the role is always taken
[1:02:37] sampsony: dang i gotta try this out then :)
[1:02:39] kwokette_: like HLL with recon squad
[1:02:40] drunktechchaser: @shroud You make it better by switching to Post Scriptum. Then you are God

[1:02:59] Phantom3611: toggle zoom would make it good
[1:02:59] RumpeLump: Squad
