[0:21:38] Sollice: That is not an official date
[0:21:44] GamingDad77: If Reddit had a picture of a comet and the title said it was headed to earth, too many people would out in their backyard wth a shovel before reading the entire article
[0:21:45] Thoreya: im sorry leaks have been correct for wow since bfa, if anything ill need convincing that its not correct LUL
[0:21:59] Thoreya: ppl said the same shit about the evoker leak, and it was 100% true
[0:22:17] Molvonos: @Thoreya Not every leak has been correct.  I'd even go as far as to say most are incorrect, but if you throw enough shit at the wall, something's bound to stick.

[0:27:25] Molvonos: @spookychefkarolina There's a hawaiian joint right down the street called 'Bad Ass Coffee', and i prefer their Jitter Juice, which is an irish cream/dark chocolate mocha flavor.  It's got the right amount of bitter to know they don't load it up with Starbuck levels of sugar.
[0:27:25] puddypounce: guys a google doc doesn't mean it's set in stone

[1:03:55] Thoreya: ye
[1:03:55] looney199725: yes
[1:03:57] MetalJoshP: Facts feral was only ever cared about when bear and cat form were in the same spec since the split it gets no love
[1:03:58] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yes
[1:03:59] SilverFox_Gaming: SilverFox_Gaming gifted a Tier 1 sub to ramhead1977! They have given 3 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:03:59] Aquadriel: Blizzard Blue Post: We decided to not make a Talent Tree for Demon Hunters. This class is so braindead that we could not come up with more than 10 nodes, so might as well not do shit, lmao.
[1:04:00] looney199725: its a long pre patch
[1:04:02] procyon_mfc: Thanksgiving is Nov 24th.
[1:04:03] Mitune: that would be Pog AF
[1:04:08] JediNeo99999: Blizz had said prepatch would be 2 weeks I thought
[1:04:10] looney199725: maybe so you get used to new talents?
[1:04:11] critin87: it's coming closer
[1:04:13] looney199725: some ppl slow
[1:04:15] Rottencoarse: pre patch october 25th then november 28th for release
[1:04:16] Tamz_tv: it gives people time to level their evokers
[1:04:19] Arbszy: We have had 3-4 weeks of prepatch before.
[1:04:20] luckfore: its legion style prepatch so i hope so
[1:04:20] xhale2nhale: I think GoW: Ragnarok also drops this year, man the gaming schedule gonna be crazy
[1:04:29] dracullus: yeah, that's why Nov 15 date makes more sense for me, especially since they said event will be 2 weeks
[1:04:32] MetalJoshP: Plus another holiday raid launch? I thought they said they were never doing that again
[1:04:36] silence_weebs: Sick, 9 ads
[1:04:42] jmalmin: I think the prepatch for lich king lasted a long long time.
[1:04:47] McMaz: prepatch = more QA testing
[1:05:00] Thoreya: i mean its def not gonna be another SOFO so itll prob be quick tier
[1:05:00] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Brackenhide Hollow - NEW Dungeon in Dragonflight | Gnoll Way Home... youtu.be/TkDv78XcZDE
[1:05:02] Sollice: @silence_weebs You should sub and get 0
[1:05:03] ShowDUH: they said they never catering to RWF anymore so they prolly dont give a damn about it
[1:05:06] IchabodCrain: They need to get all of the talent trees set up and finish up the dracthyr starting zone done. after that they'll probly start pre-patch. I'm guessing sometimes in september
[1:05:10] ramhead1977: @SilverFox_Gaming Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:05:12] PrimalRain: usually 2 weeks without raids right?
[1:05:14] Yagr6: cat runs today bb
[1:05:19] silence_weebs: @silence_weebs lol it's okay i've just never seen that many before LUL
[1:05:21] jmalmin: First raid will maybe come out in january. They can release stuff differently this expansion
[1:05:21] critin87: second I think
[1:05:31] ShowDUH: legion was 3
[1:05:32] sliproach: @Aquadriel demon hunters have been renamed  and converted to regular hunters

[1:05:35] SilverFox_Gaming: @ramhead1977 NP mate

[1:05:44] Alepouditsa: what are is the leack?
[1:05:51] Aserak: my guess is December 6th for release and the raid happens in January.
[1:05:52] bharjes1: good morning @Towelliee and chat
[1:05:53] spookychefkarolina: @silence_weebs hey that’s 100% one of the reasons I subbed LUL
[1:05:58] Aquadriel: @sliproach Seems logical
[1:05:58] captiv8: Race to world first isn’t blizzards problem. People will still buy and play WoW without it. They don’t need free publicity the game has been out for 20 years.
[1:05:59] dracullus: as always
[1:06:08] Yagr6: he said " we give up "
[1:06:09] PadidinJones: 5 week prepatch.. is that long? I forget how long the others were @Towelliee
[1:06:20] silence_weebs: @spookychefkarolina yeah it's the sole reason i gave max my prime sub as well LUL
[1:06:27] DarkviperTV: I think your right don't think that leak is legit. Expac drops on the 22

[1:06:37] McMaz: Did they fire the Druid developer??
[1:06:38] Texas_Mizfit: 10 Jan raid will come out
[1:06:39] Shrenko: the guy who found the ''leak'' was also right about Dragonflight, the new race, the new class and some Legion stuff years ago
[1:06:45] unholyshiz: I mean race to world first is such a big thing in wow. No shot they dont think about it
[1:06:48] sliproach: @Aquadriel only way to get enough skills for them to have a new talent tree
[1:06:51] Mitune: Still calling 3 day RWF
[1:07:00] captiv8: Not their problem
[1:07:04] Thoreya: maybe mythic will be third week of launch
[1:07:04] silence_weebs: Fury warrior got skull banner btw Pog

[1:07:21] Thoreya: its fake towCopium towCopium
[1:07:32] DarkviperTV: its fake for sure
[1:07:34] slapkey: that's what makes it seem likely
[1:07:35] Sarocus: Makes no sense to adapt the release date to RWF. If they dont want it over xmas, just move the raid start
[1:07:35] WhoIsAndrewJ: thats corporate america though - excel lmfao -
[1:07:36] Aserak: its a fake :)
[1:07:40] NBK_Sethus: imo they have to launch in November or wait for 2023
[1:07:41] luckfore: fake towCopium
[1:07:48] Shrenko: read top comment

[1:09:35] nocturnal_2195: i mean we will kinda find out if according to this leak on the 30th if walk pre patch comes out. if that does happen that would mean that the leak is correct so far
[1:09:39] Sollice: People take the entire week of new years off bad idea
[1:09:41] jmalmin: Blizzard can change their mind and want the pre patch out longer.
[1:09:43] looney199725: in mists ion said we get dance floor shit didnt happen
[1:09:50] Texas_Mizfit: release will be 27Dec
[1:09:51] looney199725: in wotlk he said we would have something crazy didnt happen
[1:09:52] nocturnal_2195: wrath pre patch

[1:10:09] looney199725: blizzard always changes plans
[1:10:09] Teldrin89: yeah, in interview it was said 2 weeks pre-patch
[1:10:13] dracullus: @DeanoTV not pre-patch, event, that's why I think pre-patch will last 3 weeks, 1 week is minimum to adapt for class changes, but could be longer
[1:10:14] Ziephier: the messages on Redditt mention that the poster has posted correct info before - multiple times
[1:10:15] Sollice: They finished the raid before christmas so people could go home
[1:10:16] luckfore: @looney199725 yea they always make alot of stuff up for hype
[1:10:22] gimmlay: nov 14th release date
[1:10:52] looney199725: just delay raid till jan
[1:10:59] dracullus: @Towelliee maybe mythic raid will launch same day as normal this time?
[1:11:02] looney199725: gives ppl a chance to work on new prof system
[1:11:06] MikeyGy: Gingi playing Grinch this year pls no
[1:11:06] fooxytv: have they even revealed df will be released this year? minus the pre-order stuff?
[1:11:09] MetalJoshP: Best shot is probably like a early to mid November launch date like November 1-17 ish
[1:11:13] looney199725: yes you can
[1:11:14] MetalJoshP: Ideally*
[1:11:17] Sarocus: The very long pre patch makes me think it is fake
[1:11:39] danofpv: didnt legion have like 2-3 weeks pre-patch?
[1:11:42] jamiboiy: yeah you would hold the expansion back instead of letting the lack of launch content ruin it
[1:11:46] Nicstar1007: Emotional damage
[1:11:46] Aserak: i really think dec 6th is the date for release
[1:11:46] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: Isnt it normally around the Monday before Thanksgiving or the Monday after ?

[1:12:04] mayonaes: nice quinn impression
[1:12:05] dracullus: I have feeling that many people who say it would be fine would be first to bitch that there is nothing to do

[1:12:52] eKaars: if I havent played since shadowlands release, what should I do priority wise to get "caught up" before dragonblight?
[1:12:55] Wulfroc: yea i was confused haha
[1:12:57] GroovyBryan: so if it's not ready by November, will they delay it till after the holidays?
[1:13:01] looney199725: they can launch the raid on christmas if they want fuck the world first raiders they choose that job
[1:13:07] captiv8: Why couldn’t they start mythic plus before they open mythic raiding?
[1:13:08] gritbarontv: historically they got fuck on CV quarantine, so that schedule is long gone
[1:13:10] ChaoticPriest: Leaks could almost always be accurate.. at the time. But many things are subject to change, and often do.
[1:13:13] Herzenliegen: @groovybryan yes

[1:14:59] Broomba: leveling on WoTLK PTR at the moment -- in BC zones @towelliee its fun
[1:15:01] JediNeo99999: ?
[1:15:02] jmalmin: It all depends on what the end game is.. if we got 4 zones with content like Mortis. Then you can get busy as a casual player for those 5 weeks without a problem.
[1:15:03] brabblesauce: without all the info obv, feeling brew or prot pally will be better in DF?
[1:15:16] imTymp: who needs raids just keep running dungeons till ur so bored u can do it in ur sleep easy

[1:16:51] silence_weebs: @eKaars gotcha, maybe read over the class / spec trees before they come out, watch a video or something so it's not too overhwelming when they release

[2:06:19] ChrisStoll: I was really hoping they would make all gathering professions secondary profs instead of primary. It's kind of a waste
[2:06:44] doomkry: maybe blacksmithing will make the professions tools for skinning, mining and herbalism?
[2:06:48] CapDan: @Strifelol blades of chaos PLEASE I beg?
[2:06:50] doomkry: like knifes and sickles?

[2:07:16] Moobot: @ItsGigg ALPHA FINAL PHASE 8/16/22 - Entire leveling experience plus maybe DH? BAHAHAHA It's gonna be Monks.
[2:07:16] Rabiahtaro132: @Towelliee  are your channel points going to stay as anima next expac, or are you changing it to a dragon theme?
[2:07:25] hasan666: Master baiter?
[2:07:44] CapDan: @Strifelol it's more like... without it DH is pretty much a DPM class rather than a burst class... and that feels backwards.
[2:07:49] ItsGigg: is the new build in yet or not till later
[2:07:57] MMokuin: @Towelliee Off topic: Did chat tell you big news about your boy Lirik? HYPERS

[2:08:13] the_general01: sounds like sometrhing youd find in fallout
[2:08:20] strike879: they can just have everyone gather but its scuffed if you dont have the proffesion so no prof 2 max 3 from a node with max prof 10 and chance on rare mats
[2:08:24] PrimalRain: ItsGigg probably this evening if we go by past weeks
[2:08:29] Strifelol: Give us back Chaos Blades
[2:08:37] Strifelol: BIG burst
[2:08:41] doomkry: kill mobs maybe
[2:08:48] Eggz1004: maybe beast
[2:08:48] strike879: buy from nomi?

[2:09:14] critin87: a
[2:09:20] DarkVoice_: final phase means dh & monk trees will be out?
[2:09:24] vic_ave: that's what she said
[2:09:34] CapDan: give us a real role again besides a debuff for raid @Strifelol "Vengeance isnt good rn... guess we gotta bring a DPS DH"
[2:09:37] critin87: so we need cooking
[2:10:00] CapDan: @AlphasaurusRexx so basically he died. as a father myself, he's gonna be a changed man
[2:10:11] AlphasaurusRexx: lol
[2:10:17] Strifelol: @CapDan I know it's hard but I wish all tanks were viable lol
[2:10:21] strike879: not all mats can be bought so its a bit anoying
[2:10:22] Eggz1004: unique
[2:10:23] gritbarontv: you can only carry 1
[2:10:25] Eggz1004: @Towelliee
[2:10:33] Zerfell: its unique lol
[2:10:40] jaws120: @Towelliee ur drink shoulda tasted like hammers bro. smh hammers up
[2:10:51] CapDan: @Strifelol tbf, vengeance is fine in M+ I hear
[2:10:57] pigzip: @towelliee can hunters tame these creatures?
[2:11:14] jaws120: sounds like it'll summon a mob based on the 'infusion' type, e.g. decay summons undead @Towelliee
[2:11:48] gritbarontv: you can't create more than 1
[2:11:55] RagingPunk: love professions in wow
[2:12:07] CapDan: making a tank where the main strength is "mobility" is awkward because bosses need to stay still. @Strifelol ... kiting is not the gameplay people are looking for.
[2:12:13] strike879: im gonna dump all my mats on the ah the first few weeks
[2:12:14] Finiin: If they turn out good, i'll def work on it to make gold
[2:12:18] ryanc1124: never do that shit
[2:12:21] sqknarf: your not crafting anything
[2:12:23] Katrikan: ppl who play games dont have proffs
[2:12:23] icethousand: you can't carry more than one of the elusive creature bait
[2:12:26] icethousand: might be a bug
[2:12:29] CaptainJoeyNY: Professions are only like that because they arent viable for the best gear in the game
[2:12:31] Strifelol: @CapDan I enjoy DH/Warrior tanking
[2:12:31] thatM0NEYguy: if they had a crafting system like FFXIV they would bring on a player base that plays solely for crafting
[2:12:36] futomara01: noone bothered because theyve been dogshit for over 10years
[2:12:39] ElDrakenMan: @towelliee what do you think will be the big grind will be in dragon flight since they removed borrowed power. No way they removed the grind completely right just disguised it somewhere else
[2:12:57] ajax2323: engineering has also had like mandatory utility for ages now
[2:13:00] CapDan: @Strifelol dont get me wrong, I do too... but like... compare it to the ease of bear tanking... it's a joke
[2:13:00] Jarlan23: i had that thought going into shadowlands i ended up not makign any gold with legos
[2:13:14] Jarlan23: i only just made my gold back but most of that was from raw mats instead of legendaries
[2:13:16] thatM0NEYguy: do you aspire to be a... Master Baiter?

[2:28:55] PToastman: Cool story

[2:29:47] fimmunity: If you use frost you got frost thing from skinning
[2:30:04] dkskush: towSkinTowel
[2:30:08] r0bswan: does anyone know the specific name of this OST? i' ve been looking for it for some time
[2:30:30] kharditv: the music OMG
[2:30:46] LunaKura: When does the new phase come out?
[2:30:48] zaurav: Get in there, Mahkar.
[2:30:52] jrossino: When do we expect the beta
[2:30:57] Psyquest: HI Toweliee, have you talked about the massive wave ban?
[2:31:01] Armdel: did you see the release date "leak"
[2:31:21] Korupcija_: explain?
[2:31:22] Mitune: Preach was having problems this morning
[2:31:23] Leemann9: wut us happening? seems like walking in circles. sry.. just got here
[2:31:26] Gizadragon: they just did a wave of invites for wrath
[2:31:26] Sollice: Yes he has seen the leak
[2:31:28] gritbarontv: it's slower than soar
[2:31:35] Leemann9: wut is being tested?
[2:31:35] TLshoddy: @Towelliee My starter pack from advanced came in and this energy formula is kicking
[2:31:45] Leemann9: kk
[2:31:50] Aerisot: Nov 28th is a monday as well
[2:31:52] Leemann9: cool
[2:32:03] PvtHudson093: Are you ready for a Miracle Vault?
[2:32:03] ChrisStoll: 5 week pre-patch seems solid with that adding shadowlands contant (soulbinds/ cov abilities)
[2:32:08] spookychefkarolina: @tlshoddy yayyy towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:32:13] Finiin: I'm hoping we have at least 2 months for 10.0 prepatch

[2:32:16] KingSlayerYotam: monday sucks
[2:32:22] jrossino: Jesus 28 November release? LUL
[2:32:35] Subjektive: 2 months pre-patch? you crazy?
[2:32:35] HighThereBud: Monday is the day before Tuesday.
[2:32:35] mavericks312: liquid saves xmas 2 xpacs in a row lets goo lol
[2:32:37] Kneckt: what leak
[2:32:40] fredz0rfps: you can fly now, u got 3 charges
[2:32:43] Kneckt: some1 pm me the leak pls
[2:32:45] j_bar111: Monday 6pm for east coast its really good
[2:32:47] Molvonos: I wanna say that Soar feels better than Dragonriding because you don't have the talents/skills appropriate for the area, but when you max out Dragonriding, it'll feel much better than Soar.  Soar might be normalized while Dragonriding isn't.
[2:32:50] ChrisStoll: Blink twice is you already know the release date
[2:32:52] strike879: maybe it could be 5 week if they want to give new ppl a chance to get the slime saber on a draktyr
[2:32:59] Fancyabrew: @Kneckt It was on the WoW subreddit
[2:33:03] strike879: but low odds
[2:33:11] SilkeySmooth: why do you want a 5 week pre patch??????
[2:33:19] Jarlan23: yea
[2:33:20] Hasan_Bey2: EU always gets fucked with this release date they get it few hours after NA and its on midnight people have work and family it sucks
[2:33:23] Luxicake: KEKW
[2:33:24] ItsGlime: LOL
[2:33:25] SLoPPYALieN: that's a lot of crack smoking
[2:33:25] Jarlan23: it makes SENSE
[2:33:26] Korupcija_: sounds good to me
[2:33:27] mavericks312: i get high sometimes in the morning too lol
[2:33:27] ajax2323: thats big brain
[2:33:28] Aerisot: They would already have it
[2:33:30] imbatree: All Raids will be fated by then so no need
[2:33:30] Sollice: What, get the slime mount and your Drakthyr will have it?
[2:33:31] Gregadeaux: Wasn't the legion pre-patch like a month?
[2:33:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: guess mounts are not account wide now Kappa
[2:33:35] Subjektive: mounts are account wide?
[2:33:37] Molvonos: Uuhhhh
[2:33:39] Sollice: Yes lol
[2:33:47] Ariea_Whisper: Are people high ?
[2:33:49] Sollice: @strike879 towOof towOof towOof towOof towOof towOof towOof
[2:33:49] ajax2323: not for the one-character ironman accounts duh
[2:33:51] Molvonos: That legit gave me a headache.
[2:33:53] Molvonos: Fuck
[2:33:55] Jarlan23: real reason is that they want people to fuck around with talents before dragonflight comes out
[2:34:00] Gregadeaux: Legion was 5 weeks. July 20 to Aug 30
[2:34:07] Captain_Stark99: captain_stark99 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Hooah! Enjoy the day!
[2:34:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: godzilla had a stroke and died reading that
[2:34:11] SilkeySmooth: all you need is a 2 week pre patch and thats eve to long
[2:34:18] JoJoPhantom: make the prepatch long enough for me to actually get this ones 34 slot bag 😢
[2:34:28] abracka_: i think (heavy copium) we'll get a five week pre patch because of what SL was. they did the same thing in legion, pre patch was in mid july, release date late august
[2:34:29] looney199725: dont you think tho its odd that evoker now has a coven if its only planned to be 2 weeks
[2:34:29] mavericks312: evokers start at 58 right?
[2:34:31] Sielu11628: I don’t know, Towelliee. I’m starting to think this Advancedgg stuff is going to people’s heads. Some crazy talk in here! What’s in the ingredients?!?
[2:34:32] ChrisStoll: I want a long pre-patch as long as it doesn't push back release date
[2:34:34] SLoPPYALieN: 5 weeks of testing talents... maybe
[2:34:41] looney199725: like evoker doesnt need coven ability for only 2 weeks pre patch
[2:34:42] abracka_: same thing in wod for legion*
[2:34:48] Jarlan23: ion says a lot of things
[2:34:53] Dagomarus: Yeah its not even like they start at a low level its literally 2 levels till they hit 60
[2:34:56] Molvonos: Mounts, all Mounts, are account wide.  You can get one on your current main and ride it using your Evoker.  Now, that's me stating the obvious for 'nice reasons'.
[2:34:58] looney199725: you trust ions word to much bro
[2:34:59] ItsGlime: @looney199725 no? people can still level through shadowlands after DF is released lol
[2:35:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: 2 weeks for Dragonflight prepatch sounds right to me
[2:35:00] looney199725: hes promised so much
[2:35:02] looney199725: and failed
[2:35:03] Gregadeaux: Legion was 5 weeks, but the Invasions started 2 weeks after pre-patch started
[2:35:05] SLoPPYALieN: * insert Total Recall TWO WEEEEEKS scene *
[2:35:10] Wulfroc: will prepatch have talents?
[2:35:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a pre pre patch
[2:35:11] pronkk_: they gave evokers soulbinds
[2:35:12] sliproach: @Jarlan23 an at the same time says nothing
[2:35:13] Leemann9: yes
[2:35:19] Nicstar1007: hell yeah
[2:35:19] MiddlePhaze: correct
[2:35:20] looney199725: i dont trust a word ion says
[2:35:25] Jarlan23: ill aceept an anonymous spreadsheet that says prepatch is 5 weeks instead of the game director
[2:35:30] looney199725: he has promised alot and not delivered
[2:35:31] Mitune: possibly, I assume they may also use that prepatch period for any last minute talent changes
[2:35:31] EthicalHermit: Anniversary event around that time too?
[2:35:33] Jarlan23: just bc i want to believe
[2:35:38] MOLAR305: legion pre-patch was alt leveling heaven
[2:35:39] abracka_: july 16th pre patch went live, release date was aug 30th for legion
[2:35:41] Teldrin89: but it was so cool
[2:35:43] Nicstar1007: give me that copium
[2:35:45] MiddlePhaze: wrath prepatch coming is going to be longish too with DKs
[2:35:49] awkswow: Last phase of alpha mean last trees today? also beta soonish? :O
[2:35:51] sliproach: infinte dragon flight assaults
[2:35:53] dracullus: well SL, but it was caused by delay
[2:35:54] Teldrin89: like during pre-patch I think I leveled 4-5 chars
[2:35:58] LearnedSomething: everyone loved legion invasions
[2:35:59] Molvonos: @looney199725 I'd trust someone in the business over random nobody edgelords trying too hard, tbh.  The basic understanding that he can't spill all the beans or, the fact that stuff CHANGES in development, should be understood by most.
[2:35:59] Korupcija_: man I'm glad Jimmy got the alpha
[2:36:02] LearnedSomething: that was the best prepatch ever
[2:36:13] SilkeySmooth: pre patch should be a week
[2:36:21] ChrisStoll: Ahhh crap. If they do launch DF on Nov 28th, I have a conference the next week. Rip having fun
[2:36:30] Epiclurker27893: 1 week of theory crafting, 1 week of OMG they ruined my class, 1 week of getting over it and learning, then the 2 week event
[2:36:32] looney199725: @Molvonos ion has failed on almost every promise and date hes said for the last like 3 years
[2:36:49] Jarlan23: i hope its better than shadowlands prepatch that one sucked
[2:36:58] looney199725: we can all hope
[2:36:58] Molvonos: @looney199725 has he, very specifically, stated that he 'PROMISED' that?  or is that your fanatical hatemongering headcanon?
[2:37:01] looney199725: DF overall is better than sl
[2:37:04] mavericks312: @looney199725 is that really ions fault though
[2:37:09] EKS90_: you do know its not ion that is setting the release dates?....
[2:37:29] Molvonos: Cause god damn you're so depressingly negative all the time.
[2:37:40] looney199725: i dont expect a 5 week pre patch
[2:37:40] HighThereBud: @ChrisStoll WoW is more important.
[2:37:46] zaurav: Yay Makhar!
[2:37:49] looney199725: but the expac being out in november time only thing makes sense
[2:38:07] dracullus: once Ion said in interview 2nd legendary will be for Enlightened revered reputation, then when it happened during PTR people said he lied xD
[2:38:27] ChrisStoll: @ChrisStoll @HighThereBud I know that. My company doesn't
[2:38:40] giggz91: I still evoker need a tankimg spec they could of had an ability like shield wall putting their wings infront of them blocking attacks for a couple sec's.
[2:38:44] AlphasaurusRexx: @dracullus what?
[2:38:51] SilkeySmooth: lets have no pre patch just let me in dragonflight
[2:38:57] cynical_effect12: cynical_effect12 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! GO TITANS!!
[2:39:08] giggz91: i still think*
[2:39:10] starkos7: ResidentSleeper
[2:39:24] giggz91: got alpha
[2:39:39] zaurav: BibleThump
[2:39:41] usse00: @towelliee Since it’s possible the last alpha build today, do you think we are going to get both DH and Monk talent trees
[2:39:47] looney199725: @giggz91 eh i think blizzard plans to die on the horse of no tank spec but is what it is atleast it wasnt a melee
[2:40:11] Mitune: I am worried WW is delayed like Holy pally
[2:40:23] Lincoln_WoW: prot pally is still kinda busted
[2:40:27] dracullus: to be honest all I want is to check talents and I think PTR is like month away anyway
[2:40:30] procyon_mfc: pepeD
[2:40:31] Kneckt: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:40:40] Jarlan23: no one plays monks
[2:40:42] Ithylz: Let's pray the add them at least 1 DPS button, making it to 3 total
[2:40:42] gusterugamer: wazap
[2:40:43] Roaringkittylol: WW and DH are going to be very boring trash lol
[2:40:48] looney199725: abit late to have a tank spec now for evoker
[2:40:50] Kneckt: I put the pieces together and the result? Plenty of towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:40:59] giggz91: I just checked downloading alpha CLAP

[2:41:31] Roaringkittylol: If we are lucky, we will see them before launch
[2:41:32] awkswow: Demon Hunter are going to get like focusing iris and blood of the enemy lol. No idea what they're supposed to do with that kit
[2:42:00] Molvonos: People trying to figure out class releases, alpha content  and beta: https://i.imgur.com/W1FWaR0.png
[2:42:03] looney199725: they already said why dh is last
[2:42:06] looney199725: they are struggling
[2:42:11] TLshoddy: DH is just simple lmao, ofc they will hold off on it and fix the hard specs
[2:42:15] mavericks312: havoc still gonna be eye beam build lol
[2:42:16] looney199725: same when they struggled to even make dh in legion
[2:42:26] mistr_pockets: lol
[2:42:32] Sollice: @looney199725 ? Why do you equate with DH last being struggling?
[2:42:34] Molvonos: Got a source for that quote Looney?
[2:42:41] awkswow: Can't wait for glide to be a talent :D
[2:42:41] Mitune: I just want WDP and SEF not to be the default for another expansion for WW
[2:42:41] Ithylz: Eternity's Span @Towelliee
[2:42:45] Utmost777: DH gets 2 Meta cds just so Warlocks have more to complain about
[2:42:48] the_hoff_man: idk, i never liked new classes. never enjoyed DK or DH and envokers didnt realy grab me...
[2:43:00] Merclicious: did you guys talk about the pre patch leak yet
[2:43:01] looney199725: @Sollice because they confirmed they struggled with it in legion and the dev on dh said dh wont be out for awhile
[2:43:05] Ithylz: Up left of Shattering Star
[2:43:15] awkswow: @Merclicious prepatch leak?
[2:43:20] Molvonos: ..???  towTinfoil
[2:43:23] Mister_Ript: I enjoyed DK, but didn't really have an interest in Monks or DH's.
[2:43:23] looney199725: theres been no datamined dh build at all
[2:43:47] Mister_Ript: Demon Hunters only have like 8 spells. Hard to make talents based on that lol
[2:43:52] Sollice: @looney199725 It's a new class. Again new with less lore, abilities etc to pull from. When you say struggle it sounds different than I think you mean it
[2:43:52] RockemSockem0821: RockemSockem0821 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 65 months! 
[2:44:12] Coldfire989: Second or third to last row
[2:44:15] Merclicious: theres a huge leak saying pre patch is august 30th and game release nov 28
[2:44:23] EKS90_: @Molvonos I did read that people in the DH discord got told by the dev that it will take some time to get out cause of changing some stuff on it.   But might just be hearsay cause i never saw the actuall post.
[2:44:24] looney199725: they struggled to make the specs is what im saying baxk then they said so and now they have to triple it alot of work for them
[2:44:30] Ithylz: Didn't you ask the talent that make it hit more targets? Maybe I misheard, sry then
[2:44:34] jumpered: DH have to get alot of old legion talents to be able to get a talent tree, DH players miss alot of old talents, unless they come upp with new ones
[2:44:35] Molvonos: I'm looking for  this supposed dev post saying they struggled with DH development during Legion.
[2:44:46] slovakhavoc: This new talent System looks so bad
[2:44:48] awkswow: August? 30th? Lol not a single chance. Did you mean October?
[2:44:55] Chronine: @Merclicious thats for classic
[2:44:56] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee hi and hi chat

[2:45:19] Coldfire989: @chronine the prepatch is for classic the other part is DF
[2:45:21] FutileDiploma: @towelliee is it true you can change your talents in the dungeon or raid per fight?
[2:45:21] Kneckt: same guy leaked the expac tho right?
[2:45:23] Merclicious: oh shit haha i misread the post
[2:45:27] Xynthos_Gaming: @towelliee are there more dungeons unlocking today?
[2:45:29] Roth___: ayeeee my birthday launch again POGGERS
[2:45:29] wrhashwizard: any idea why the down time is so long today?
[2:45:29] Merclicious: but yeah oct 25th prepatch
[2:45:32] casom2727: So final phase, does that mean we get DH and Monk talents today? Need those MW
[2:45:35] PvtHudson093: no one wants to raid over the holidays
[2:45:37] onous_: There's no way. does it even feel like it's ready?
[2:45:38] jamiboiy: hasn't the race to world first happened at Christmas before?
[2:45:47] Merclicious: The source is apparently insanely accurate though
[2:45:48] Armdel: they'll be nice and make the raid easy for rwf :)
[2:45:53] MaxTheBandit: im the one who made it for my economics class :)
[2:46:02] HighThereBud: The Sword of a Thousand Truths.
[2:46:09] tornbraclet: @Towelliee just got my starter kit today looking forward to trying some of the focus
[2:46:21] Rulem: and multiple class trees not even released yet!  crazy
[2:46:23] MonarchTeaV: It fits the schedule of s4
[2:46:27] Armdel: 2 months and how many specs still don't have new talent trees?
[2:46:29] SirVoro: Towelliee I love it!
[2:46:33] Kneckt: aparrently its the same person who leaked evoker etc on mmochamp
[2:46:34] looney199725: @Rulem only monk and dh not in?
[2:46:37] Molvonos: @Molvonos That's a whole lotta heresay without actual proof.  There's a lot of reasons why something might take longer, but what people dont get is that there was always going to be a class 'last' in dev.  People're just doomsaying.
[2:46:44] Redpandalol: My bday is the 24th of oct
[2:46:46] PvtHudson093: whats the short answer on Asmons banned from wow video?
[2:46:48] Jarlan23: 9 weeks sounds a lot shorter than 2 months
[2:46:49] Merclicious: The leaker who leaked Dragonflight, the new race, the new class (and some Legion stuff years ago) said it would come out November 2022. He also was right about Darkfallen.

[2:47:09] MaxTheBandit: @PvtHudson093 false positive, bunch of pvpers banned for RMT

[2:47:37] spookychefkarolina: Focus is nice. I feel it enhances the effects of the magnesium I take daily.
[2:47:37] awkswow: Didn't CN have a very successful late December launch? Seems like it'd be perfect. Go raid with the boys while you're off on a holiday. Idgaf how it affects the RWF
[2:47:41] finejeez1: it was when the game was actually good
[2:47:50] procyon_mfc: (ditto)
[2:47:58] Herzenliegen: There's no way
[2:47:59] Kneckt: @Towelliee same person who leaked DF,evoker and dracthyr etc and other legion stuff is aparrently the one who posted it
[2:48:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: 2 months is not a long time
[2:48:10] Kwurky: That's a big no from me, dog
[2:48:17] Hawke_89: Tight?
[2:48:18] Groukh: Pre-patch could be pushed back at least 2-3 weeks
[2:48:25] Merclicious: Yeah I agree, its way too short of a testing cycle, but hopefully they know what theyre doing.
[2:48:29] Roaringkittylol: Do we know what the renown system looks like?
[2:48:30] mrrazputin: Do we know whats the max lvl content ?
[2:48:32] Runestoner: @Towelliee Hey, I was wondering if you have any hints on monks for DF?
[2:48:40] Kwurky: It'd have to go to an almost fully open beta to get everything properly tested in 2 months
[2:49:21] MonarchTeaV: I’m guessing 4 not 5 week
[2:49:23] sliproach: @Towelliee Fishing in bear form from Tuskar renown right?
[2:49:26] Utmost777: I wish they could update the AH without taking down the whole game like new world did
[2:49:41] SpyCrabbo: @Kwurky you just need a couple hundred MrGMs and everything will be tested just fine
[2:49:45] looney199725: you say its just leveling but you also have professions to prog now too
[2:49:46] Merclicious: Normal blizzard hasnt been working lately so maybe its time for change? lol
[2:49:58] Roth___: anyone know when wotlk pre patch might drop?
[2:50:05] LearnedSomething: finding the bugs is only half the work you know
[2:50:08] LearnedSomething: takes time to fix them
[2:50:18] looney199725: well blizzard are gonna try get you too
[2:50:22] CapDan: @UtmostOwnage o right, THAT wildly successful game... New World... Kappa
[2:50:23] Honeycrispie: yea like majority of the playerbase wont touch proffs nearly as much as ppl expect lol
[2:50:26] looney199725: they didnt revamp it to be ignored yano they want ppl to try
[2:50:27] zenkodac: didnt rwf CN also happen during christmas?
[2:50:38] CrunkyBrewster: i only ever did gathering for money
[2:50:44] looney199725: its not okay im not saying its okay but there isnt just leveling now
[2:50:49] MonarchTeaV: the races though
[2:50:51] Molvonos: They cant force people to do professions.
[2:50:52] MonarchTeaV: thats the true end pvp
[2:50:59] n3mo_gr: so drakthyr looks like a normal dragon? no weapons/ armor used are visible?
[2:51:05] Mizahri: @zenkodac M Denathrius was first cleared on like the 24th
[2:51:08] rbsk212: What if release during the week that blizzcon was supposed to happen
[2:51:17] Angxlic: wow desperately needs more variety in end-game content. I feel like lost ark does it so well.
[2:51:20] SpyCrabbo: @n3mo_gr weapons, belt and shoulders are visible
[2:51:20] Honeycrispie: it really is just level and get prebis. same as usual start of expac stuff.
[2:51:22] Molvonos: If I have the gold, I can buy all my shit via the AH.  Saying they're gonna force people to do professions is ...what?
[2:51:24] Herzenliegen: NOt going to happen
[2:51:28] Herzenliegen: Not*
[2:51:31] CapDan: tehy arent literally shooting themselves in the foot @rbsk212

[2:51:32] onous_: therealonous gifted a Tier 1 sub to fishstxx! 
[2:51:35] sliproach: @CrunkNo1 used to do gathering for the bonus stam crit haste perks
[2:51:39] ashwing_: Oh great now EU cant launch the WoW client
[2:51:46] Rulem: @Towelliee what has been your fav spec to test on the alpha?
[2:51:49] Utmost777: @CapDan yeah, they did a lot wrong, but I feel like being able to fix things like the AH without taking the game down was a big plus
[2:51:51] mozavich: i know the environment has changed and all but i remember blizzard releasing wow on 11/23, like 2 days before thanksgiving lol. worst thanksgiving ever.
[2:51:53] zenkodac: oh it got to the week but it didnt go to the actual day 24th, for some reason i was left with the idea it lasted thru thr 24
[2:51:56] Honeycrispie: Yeah nah fuck that
[2:51:56] Tomykoks: @Angxlic if mandatory daily boring grind is good end game content, i agree with u
[2:52:01] Honeycrispie: seems silly
[2:52:01] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[2:52:22] Angsterz: did the new build arrive yet?
[2:52:27] looney199725: they could have a month of M+ you always get m+ before mythic raid anyways
[2:52:27] sliproach: @CrunkNo1 ahh the good ole days
[2:52:32] LearnedSomething: they've had no qualms about releasing content before vacation and not fixing it until after they're back
[2:52:36] Runestoner: Anyone in here know how evoker healers are looking for their DPS in M
[2:52:39] Angxlic: @Angxlic no like guardian raids, legion raids, not necessarily dailies grinding on 10 alts
[2:52:43] wreckshoptv: that looks like an isle expedition
[2:52:49] CrunkyBrewster: oh my
[2:52:52] wreckshoptv: i like it
[2:53:02] looney199725: end of day blizzard will do what they want no one knows till they say so

[2:56:20] darkgaurdian07: invoker looks so cool whose gonna play anything else lol just the spell effects alone are sick
[2:56:25] TheBoogs: Can we do the week after for launch, Towelliee? I’m on vacation on the 29th
[2:56:31] Surrillian: Maybe because it’s final phase we see both talent trees copious
[2:56:31] Finiin: I hate to be that person, but I think it's going to end up being extended
[2:56:39] Surrillian: Copium
[2:56:42] bakersdozen125: Think there will be a retail pre-patch event for DF to gear up alts?
[2:56:49] Respls: they have to do sfo then break the ah then try and fix it again then revert it back 3 times and then get it the way they want
[2:56:51] rbsk212: What about 2nd or 3rd week in November
[2:56:53] BrowneePoints: Wait it's legit the final alpha phase this week?
[2:56:55] SLoPPYALieN: Machine Gun Revenger...
[2:56:58] Sollice: @Finiin ? We arent even close to the scheduled downtime lol. Why are you thinking extended
[2:57:04] Kneckt: @BrowneePoints yup
[2:57:24] dreamwalker213: Did they give a reason for the 8 hour maintenance? Is it just a bunch of bug fixes?
[2:57:31] Knocx: mmmm advanced.gg cherry limeaid to start the morning off
[2:57:32] Sollice: Fated and AH
[2:57:40] rbsk212: @towelliee when do you think we will start seeing beta
[2:57:55] Finiin: @Sollice just normally ends up always being extended
[2:57:57] Sollice: @rbsk212 When it becomes available
[2:58:03] alex12645: region wide ah
[2:58:11] awkswow: Twitch chat doesn't know what post production validation is.

[2:58:51] Epixil: can this dragon class heal anything while dps spec?
[2:58:53] stevezilla714: how you like the new blizzard ui
[2:59:04] Gingerprimer: @HaloS23 all AH are regions are account wide
[2:59:08] AlphasaurusRexx: @HaloS23 region wide auction house now instead of server wide.
[2:59:42] Yagr6: just more undercutting , which means cheap shit and less gold made
[2:59:43] Finiin: commodity items will be region

[3:04:27] Spec69: Great, EU cant launch wow cause blizzard fucked up something on the launcher KEKW
[3:04:34] Sollice: Your mom has bleed damage...OOOOOOOOOOOOOO sorry couldnt let that one go
[3:04:34] LearnedSomething: this interface hurts my eyes
[3:04:37] Finiin: I've always been in the camp of tanks should never be doing tons of damage as if they were dps
[3:04:55] Djfarmville: @Sollice CouldYouNot
[3:05:07] MonarchTeaV: they pushed it out a tad too early lol, i wouldn't count servers being up for at least another 6 hours
[3:05:15] Frank4LuLz: @Sollice  KEKW

[3:06:18] Jomuse92: @Finiin I am as well. I'm more of a fan of a tank being just unkillable if played correctlyu
[3:06:22] Finiin: Alpha i mean
[3:06:36] ashwing_: @Spec69 Try closing your game and opening it again KEKW

[3:08:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disco bear is badass
[3:08:18] sliproach: my EU just started a update
[3:08:18] dyslexican1: Man i maina prot pally, and ret as off spec. but watching other ret pallys REEE over changes to ret made me laugh so hard! lol
[3:08:22] EKS90_: I got an update on EU, and it wont launch anyway, something from NAs maintenance got into EUs version im guessing early
[3:08:26] EKS90_: so its just borked
[3:08:39] Korupcija_: go to AH PogChamp
[3:08:49] strike879: just open wow without using the bnet app
[3:08:53] morgott21: how come my friends on EU are playing? but mine can't uipdate

[3:09:22] mavericks312: @Jollywhompus something with the auction house i think
[3:09:28] Respls: lol one can dream
[3:09:47] KyleEverett: all commodities are region wide, and boosting advertising is banished to is own hidden channel
[3:09:49] zerkernn: !ALPHA
[3:09:50] Moobot: @zerkernn ALPHA FINAL PHASE 8/16/22 - Entire leveling experience plus maybe DH? BAHAHAHA It's gonna be Monks.
[3:09:51] Mitune: Hope that means Alpha stuff sooner rathe rthan later
[3:10:07] Seerated: Mine doesn'et even list a patchversion now..
[3:10:16] Jollywhompus: oh @mavericks312 is this the one where selling carries gets its own chat and trade has its own chat now and AH can buy from mobile?
[3:10:27] KyleEverett: I just need monk talents
[3:10:31] morgott21: damn that flight master mount looks nice
[3:10:34] EKS90_: @pacific3210 endgame will only be in beta to test the mythics and raiding.
[3:10:35] ChefJoe925: what class for dragon flight?
[3:10:43] Imolius: ???
[3:10:44] reggiepowa: need to see the systems
[3:10:44] MonarchTeaV: do we have any idea what the season affix will be yet
[3:10:48] awkswow: Surely there's *some* sort of progression system, even if untied to power
[3:10:49] Gingerprimer: @ChefJoe925 monk
[3:10:58] ChefJoe925: @Gingerprimer sick
[3:11:00] mavericks312: endgame is raiding high key pushes etc
[3:11:10] morgott21: I miss timeless isle.
[3:11:11] Barkybamboo: BfA had islands, SL had Torghast, do you know of anything like that for DF?
[3:11:13] reggiepowa: need to see how is gear obtained
[3:11:14] Gingerprimer: @awkswow yeah there is the proffesion thing and zone based renows for transmog/toys
[3:11:22] reggiepowa: how is it connected to professions
[3:11:26] Groukh: @Barkybamboo Dragon racing LUL
[3:11:30] ChefJoe925: do you think they should make reputation account wide?? @Towelliee
[3:11:34] awkswow: Thdlock isn't going to like this.
[3:11:34] Gingerprimer: @Barkybamboo no nothing like that at least not tied to power
[3:11:39] Morasch01: so the casual people who dont raid or do dungeons dont do end game by your definition?
[3:11:41] winglessangelsttv: What’s ur productions for a launch date? What’s the one big thing that blizz still needs to focus on?
[3:11:41] raldrik: I predict that without any system that requires a grind for power this patch will fail.
[3:11:42] ChrisStoll: Ready to do that Zerith Mortis grind on the Drac for prepatch?
[3:11:44] Ribastur0075: monk,and,dh,today?
[3:11:47] reggiepowa: every expansion had a different gear gimmick pretty much
[3:11:56] imbatree: @Morasch01 you literally dont
[3:12:11] DaProfit: new Kobra Kai Trailer just came out unsure if you watched
[3:12:11] Tamz_tv: Systems Madge
[3:12:12] EKS90_: this is more wod than legion,bfa,SL,
[3:12:14] mavericks312: the only "system" in DF is tier gear
[3:12:15] TheBroCrow: systems? Madge
[3:12:16] DaProfit: Cobra*
[3:12:25] Eggz1004: no dragon anima/azerite power? no way!
[3:12:26] dannexx: thoughts on riot games mmo @Towelliee
[3:12:31] KyleEverett: Blizzard is spending a lot of dev time on zone and world content because that is end game for a large portion of their playerbase
[3:12:32] awkswow: It'll feel like Vanilla through Wrath then
[3:12:33] awkswow: That's okay
[3:12:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: angry beaver!
[3:12:40] Ordicos: why i get the feeling that there no system people are going to moan that there nothing to do
[3:12:41] Groukh: @Eggz1004 Aspect Power*
[3:12:46] strike879: currious to see how long it will take before ppl will bitch about not having a grind for power
[3:12:49] Gingerprimer: @awkswow I think mop is more of their goal
[3:12:58] Morasch01: @Morasch01 saying that max level zones with its own progression systems arnt endgame is crazy to me
[3:13:01] Eggz1004: @Eggz1004 yes!
[3:13:02] Redpandalol: Not yet
[3:13:04] raldrik: last time we were without systems leveling was an accomplishment. DF 10.0 will become a raid log game faster than any expansion in history
[3:13:12] Kneckt: lol this is the reason for the broken EU client: https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1559577085319970817
[3:13:20] Barkybamboo: islands and torghast arent tied to power. If all DF has for end game is raiding and M+ its very lacking
[3:13:26] mavericks312: @Morasch01 endgame stuff is raiding high key pushes, pvp
[3:13:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: more angry beavers!
[3:13:30] Gamalimbo: Anyone got an idea when we see DH talents?
[3:13:44] zenkodac: raldrik i dont know what you mean classic was a raidlog fest no one did anythign else
[3:13:44] Seerated: Aaah, thanks @Kneckt :)
[3:13:46] Rulem: and I'm good with it
[3:13:51] mavericks312: but thats what players wanted
[3:13:54] KyleEverett: What's wrong with raid logging sometimes. You get to have a life outside of the game being a second job.
[3:13:58] mavericks312: log in for 15 minutes and log off
[3:14:00] Omochrome: Feels good, love raid logging
[3:14:02] Harskare: that seems fantastic
[3:14:05] Runestoner: @Towelliee Hey what is making prot warriors deal that much damage in dungeons?
[3:14:10] winglessangelsttv: What’s ur predictions for a launch date? What’s the one big thing that blizz still needs to focus on?
[3:14:12] Gingerprimer: If the game is good I can do M+ and raid all day long
[3:14:13] Zr0_gg: how dare they just let players do the content they want to do and not forced them to log in. /s
[3:14:14] Rulem: WoW doesn't need to replace everything in my life to raid
[3:14:45] SimonPapeArt: @Morasch01 everything you can do b4 hitting maxlvl and isnt a game mode is not considered "endgame" in wow
[3:14:47] lithium364: no casual content except lfr would be a disaster after sl
[3:14:52] Gingerprimer: It has good stuff and not any clealry bad stuff
[3:14:56] Gamalimbo: It seems they go more casual, which I like
[3:14:58] EKS90_: I rather have this and be more comfortable playing more than 1 char without feeling i have to log in everyday.
[3:15:01] mistr_pockets: Let  blizz focus on the core endgame "vanilla" experience (raid, M+, PVP tuning) and not worry about currency grinds and torghast/heart of azeroth/legion weapons type borrowed power systems
[3:15:05] Icytroll: Thrall ?!
[3:15:08] Cre8Carnage81: Talents look very lack lustre
[3:15:21] mavericks312: the whole i only wanna play for 30 minutes mind set is crazy to me
[3:15:23] MOLAR305: i wonder if the fact guilds broke because of SOFO had something to do with their new philosophy on raiding
[3:15:26] apok37: how is this xpac supposed to be more casual? sorry just tuning in
[3:15:29] LyazaS: isnt this wintergrasp music?
[3:15:41] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:15:47] mavericks312: the big 3 is always fine
[3:15:54] Gingerprimer: @LyazaS yes he runs a youtube music playlist in the background
[3:15:58] Imolius: ?
[3:15:59] Morasch01: @Morasch01 like i said, MAX LEVEL zones, and its progression.
[3:16:00] mistr_pockets: true RE: pvp
[3:16:00] Thoreya: yet theyre adding solo que lo
[3:16:02] ZuggSpeedman: lol yes it has
[3:16:05] SilkeySmooth: i only play wow for the pvp..lol
[3:16:05] lithium364: pvp died in mop
[3:16:10] ZuggSpeedman: pvp is a shit show every xpac
[3:16:14] og_gt710: i mean it is, blizz just doesn't want to acknowledge it
[3:16:21] HaloS23: @Towelliee one thing i do like about DF, is that the story seems to be resetting. like we arent against some astronomical mega force that we have to stop! Like we are back to killing dragons! more or less.
[3:16:21] Imolius: ^
[3:16:23] og_gt710: haven't for years
[3:16:28] mattjee1: id rather kms then pvp
[3:16:29] MikeyGy: i mean they allowed community to decide m+ dungeons pool and we got grimrail do imnot gonna trust with comunity telling them how to balance/what to introduce to the game LuL
[3:16:30] MonarchTeaV: Pvp was fun in season 1 of sl then fell off hard
[3:16:33] temp3st98: pvp died in legion with no progression with pvp gear
[3:16:33] Cre8Carnage81: Personally don’t want talent trees back been there done that many years ago
[3:16:36] Tamz_tv: the pvp community don't exactly help RBG players still DDoSing each other
[3:16:38] SilkeySmooth: if wow didnt have any pvp i wouldnt play it
[3:16:39] mrsuflakis: pvp will have solo q
[3:16:46] DunesGames: Dragonriding and some zone renown stuff should keep casual players busy right?
[3:16:46] haveachub: @HaloS23 this
[3:16:50] DubakuMatumbo: Pls tow … don’t say it sadge
[3:16:53] doomkry: i wished they brought back reforging
[3:16:56] mavericks312: @HaloS23 you do realize void vs light is possibly next xpac/starting by end of df right
[3:16:58] Roaringkittylol: The gameplay cycle during WoW's peak was: Raid, Dungeons, PvP, Professions. Rinse repeat with alts to see the same content from a different perspective and it was fun. There was less gear and every piece felt great to get. I would like to return to those days with a juiced up world content and story telling.
[3:17:00] Pine: if people want to PvP, they play PvP focused games like COD, Apex, etc.
[3:17:01] ThaOriginalGamester: i've never PVP'd as hard as I did in BFA after essences... 🤔
[3:17:01] Warcraftthor: that was fun
[3:17:03] Barkybamboo: if your a raider or m+'er good for you, go do that, Im saying do they have anything to do for the people who dont focus on that
[3:17:05] lithium364: @Tamz_tv 100% true ddos on 1900 rating these people are insane
[3:17:11] degonite29: Blizz just needs to redo pvp in general new maps new game modes or it will never be good again imo.
[3:17:22] ashwing_: EU is fixed now.
[3:17:25] Thoreya: yet theyre hiring more pvp people in DF LUL
[3:17:32] DunesGames: @barkybamboo yes, dragonriding, professions, and zone renown
[3:17:33] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Engineering in Dragonflight!? - THIS IS SO MUCH FUN! youtu.be/o4bD1qGHCVw
[3:17:35] CasualTryhrd: my favorite is when someone doesn't play for an entire patch and then just logs on to get glad
[3:17:42] ohnot___her: @Pine Thats a cold take. I know plenty of people that play "pvp" type games and LOVE WoW pvp
[3:17:45] olyv12: I loved BGs but the best one they ever did was Warsong lol
[3:17:45] SilkeySmooth: if i want to pve ill paly ff14 and eso not wow...lol
[3:17:47] zenkodac: i think eveyrone having their own "this is when pvp died" and them all being diffrent shows why pvp in wow never really worked
[3:17:51] ohnot___her: hot take*
[3:17:52] Sollice: Need a grind. Becomes raid logging
[3:17:54] Gunshyb: !adv

[3:18:03] mavericks312: @SilkeySmooth yet your in a wow stream
[3:18:03] Jarlan23: as long as the grind is account wide i welcome them
[3:18:10] DunesGames: renown is that right?
[3:18:13] Jarlan23: if i have to grind stupid shit like that on my alts thats when i have an issue
[3:18:17] HaloS23: @mavericks312 right! I can see where its going but just seems to be resetting... i probably will be back "mega force" come 11.0
[3:18:18] Jollywhompus: I miss reputation rewards for various areas
[3:18:21] Nicstar1007: Yeah but not grind with every Char
[3:18:24] zgag: Fun for Blizzard typically = nerf
[3:18:27] gruntpunch: I am a 5 minute player
[3:18:31] SilkeySmooth: @mavericks312 as i said i only play wow the the pvp.
[3:18:32] Rulem: their new renown (rep grind) does that, right?
[3:18:32] Xynthos_Gaming: lol
[3:18:35] Adventw0lf: I still say raid logging is fine. If you only want to raid then just raid. If you enjoy M+ do that too. I don't feel like a game should be telling me I HAVE to do something. I want to play a game to have FUN
[3:18:39] CasuallyEfficient: Getting paid to play the game is entirely different if doing it as a hobby . ESP grinding AP shit
[3:18:45] UltraContent: need more uptime on flyng thats like gliding
[3:18:50] LyazaS: Designing it like a mobile game.
[3:18:50] Adventw0lf: If I only want to raid then I'll only log on to raid and then I'll go play other games
[3:18:51] Conzo_Live: towellie can you get the servers up for me? thank you.
[3:18:52] Barkybamboo: @DunesGames you think flying around on dragon is endgame?
[3:18:54] xseaka: Why is everyone so set on needing a "GRIND". Why can't there just be actual content to take up time.
[3:19:07] KingSlayerYotam: im fine with 1 hour gameplay a day
[3:19:07] mavericks312: @Adventw0lf welcome to mmo's
[3:19:12] ThaOriginalGamester: Time Shamer! HahaPoint
[3:19:15] mistr_pockets: you right
[3:19:15] CasualTryhrd: "You don't respect MY time! Timeist!" - probably
[3:19:17] gruntpunch: The Vanilla demographic all grown up
[3:19:18] Rulem: I think they do have that
[3:19:19] noewon: sodaMad  timest towellie
[3:19:21] DunesGames: @barkybamboo unlocking the talent trees is endgame
[3:19:28] t_train_va: It's why I like 14. No grinds, but you can do "grinds" of your own doing (Achievements, etc.)
[3:19:34] Sollice: @xseaka How much content do you think they can constantly churn out? People will finish the game quicker than they already done
[3:19:35] fragony: people that have a problem with raid logging are usually plebs
[3:19:41] SilkeySmooth: still better then shadowlands..lol
[3:19:47] Rulem: That is dragonriding leveling and renown rep grinds now
[3:19:48] DuffDawg93: Not everyone can play for a living bro. Please chill and stop being a weirdo
[3:19:55] Gingerprimer: @DunesGames you are done 70 with the tree
[3:19:55] doomkry: EU is working boys
[3:19:57] ohnot___her: I just dont understand why people want wow to be this "season" type game. Youre playing a RPG. There should be a grind, there should be something that makes me wanna log in every day and progress my character.
[3:20:00] Barkybamboo: @DunesGames thats basic, its not endgame to keep you logging in for months
[3:20:14] Gingerprimer: @shreks13inchuncuthog yes grinding gear is that
[3:20:15] imbatree: in my opinion they are resting a lil to hard on Mythic Plus, no really Affixe Revamp since Legion
[3:20:21] DunesGames: @barkybamboo which is why I listed like two other things for you to do bb
[3:20:24] mavericks312: SL's had tons of content
[3:20:25] Thoreya: i miss AP, was the filler content i can do by myself. but i know everyone rees about it
[3:20:31] EKS90_: @shreks13inchuncuthog wow has b een a season game for a long time now.  even with the "borrowed power"
[3:20:31] linuxlifer: There is a big difference between having content and having fun content.
[3:20:32] feskstv: I feel I’m the only one who hate this trash new flight mode
[3:20:33] billybaggens: billdoobiebaggens subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! good morning towel!
[3:20:35] Shatraugh: atm the only thing that tickles my pink is fury warrior.. i dont give a shit about the fancy dragonriding.. I want to see the world content before i decide play or not
[3:20:36] KyleEverett: Blizzard also knows without direct power people don't do content much. Islands for example
[3:20:40] SilkeySmooth: how many times did you say shadowlands had no content and was playing other games?...lmao
[3:20:42] Sollice: @linuxlifer Thats also very subjective
[3:20:44] temp3st98: we can hope the 100 new devs to fix the patch draughts
[3:20:45] awkswow: WoW could really stand to copy GW2 world events
[3:20:48] gusterugamer: Shadowlands has cotent but it is boring
[3:20:52] Sollice: @SilkeySmooth Who?
[3:20:52] temp3st98: droughts
[3:20:53] Arbszy: im excited for raid logging again. I only got so much time.
[3:20:56] MonarchTeaV: I could see them including old systems in df down the line, similar to mage tower from legion etc.
[3:21:00] Rulem: every zone has its own renown grind and you have dragonriding leveling
[3:21:00] Thoreya: we need bfa level content
[3:21:01] Buzzz_Light_Beer: What if you did the content and then stroked out and forgot about it
[3:21:03] Thoreya: or legion
[3:21:05] dreamwalker213: @barkybamboo what is there in SL that you log on everyday to do? Besides raid or M+
[3:21:16] Limpickles: omg those bags
[3:21:18] botscast: BoEs from quests?
[3:21:28] thatguynamedjans: 270 is rare loot at 64? So will 291-304 loot carry us all the way to 70 or something?

[3:21:42] linuxlifer: @linuxlifer And thats why community feedback is for and when you see trends in feedback then they should pay attention.
[3:21:43] ohnot___her: I cant remember the last time i did a regular SL wq
[3:21:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want it tied to power, at least for a catch-up
[3:21:46] EKS90_: BFa leveles of content but for cosmetics etc etc and stuff,  without power progression? im good with that.
[3:21:51] sesameskeet03: Is combined Backpack normal now?
[3:22:02] smashwow: nope just stop

They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[3:22:03] sesameskeet03: or a mod?
[3:22:03] Eggz1004: THD would be over the moon about it
[3:22:03] DunesGames: @barkybamboo and you need to do that continuously at max level?
[3:22:07] AlphasaurusRexx: @dreamwalker213 transmog
[3:22:14] ChrisStoll: @sesameskeet03 yes it's new feature
[3:22:18] figsaregood: problem is that if content not power related but you need gear for it, it's entirely anti casual, like 9.2 torghast where all powers scale from your ilvl
[3:22:23] sesameskeet03: sweet
[3:22:24] Gingerprimer: NGL will be sweet just being able to M+/Raid and not having to worry about doing my weekly renown or torghast weekly
[3:22:24] mieko29: Even how much grind korthia was I still prefer that over zereth mortis
[3:22:29] ChrisStoll: @sesameskeet03 No need for bagnon anymore
[3:22:33] Barkybamboo: @DunesGames I enjoy torghast, I like to collect the mounts, pets and mog from it.
[3:22:42] dreamwalker213: @barkybamboo I’d rather have no content then the trash that was torghast
[3:22:46] MonarchTeaV: Bring back challenge modes for a dif version of the gear
[3:22:46] Jeanssi: 0 gear
[3:22:48] MereMortal: Stay away from the word power - collect/do something to turn in for rep grinds
[3:22:50] zenkodac: ikr LUL
[3:22:53] DunesGames: renown should have that stuff @barkybamboo
[3:22:59] dreamwalker213: @alphasaurusrexx that still exists in DF
[3:23:01] Eggz1004: heroic gear now is 249
[3:23:01] ChrisStoll: But Towelliee, I need to 1 shot everything with a blink of my eye
[3:23:05] tbmj_blaze: I love that kind of content so I can feel like I can play other games
[3:23:11] Buzzz_Light_Beer: I’m not a player, I just crush a lot.
[3:23:13] smashwow: heroic raid gear or heroic dungeon gear?
[3:23:15] Barkybamboo: @dreamwalker213 then dont do it, but doesnt mean others shouldnt have anything cuz you dont wantt it
[3:23:20] SimonPapeArt: What confuses me is Blizzard not realizing that the easy fix to motivate peeps to play their systems or modes is by designing awesome cosmetics as rewards isntead of power creep.
[3:23:25] OGXanos: greens are 226, ezpz
[3:23:36] Tiamarilien: Not tied to power, sounds good. With the previous expacs content that gives power made it feel less fun and more mandatory. Which meant I felt like I was falling behind, leveling an alt, which led to burn out.
[3:23:37] unsolved_return: How are ret palas looking so far bro
[3:23:37] cheatsmcgee: I've been doing Zereth Mortis on my 160 ilvl fresh 60 hunter lol
[3:23:39] SimonPapeArt: like awesome awesome
[3:23:47] EKS90_: @dreamwalker213 you had to tho because it was a power progression grind, now you dont have to.
[3:23:49] ProfessorChaoos: I just used my boost last week and my warrior went from 149 all the way to 260, mind its an alt and i had catch ups but it was nice
[3:23:51] iamspacemanspiff: heroic dungeons drop 249 right now so
[3:23:52] mieko29: Give me another insane in the membrane grind I'll gladly do it
[3:24:00] CapDan: @SimonPapeArt but then what would they sell in the Real money shop?
[3:24:01] smashwow: i mean you can do ZM at 160. you're going to hate life as most classes. but you can do it.
[3:24:04] MOLAR305: do you think this AH patch will mess with prices?
[3:24:06] DunesGames: professions should allow for gearing right?
[3:24:14] AlphasaurusRexx: @dreamwalker213 you said why do i log into shadowlands if not raid/m+. someone said torghast and i said transmog.
[3:24:15] SimonPapeArt: @CapDan sadge truth
[3:24:15] raldrik: I guess I am more old school the boomer I am. I liked grinding neck levels. Just wish it was account wide.
[3:24:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prices should drop
[3:24:26] OGXanos: mats are going to tank HARD
[3:24:27] dreamwalker213: @commander_eggi I know that’s what I’m saying, just having content doesn’t mean anything if that content is mandatory AND bad
[3:24:28] Mister_Ript: Blizzard should've implemented armor with color regions when they introduced Inscription.  Craft dyes to customize gear and/or sell premium dyes on the Shop.
[3:24:28] ChronoSchwifty: The real problem with the "content" that shadowlands has it that the rewards are a long list of recolors and not unique items be it cosmetics or mounts.
[3:24:35] lithium364: the lost ark bots are already prepared to switch games Kappa
[3:24:51] EKS90_: @dreamwalker213 I agree, i was responding to the person saying  " just dont do it  lol"
[3:25:11] Naturalbeef: I'm just excited to play a lot of alts in DF
[3:25:15] dreamwalker213: @alphasaurusrexx I was asking him what makes him log in everyday in SL that won’t exist in DF
[3:25:30] Gingerprimer: @Naturalbeef same
[3:25:33] mavericks312: ill do grinds like that all day
[3:25:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: ooooh battle pass
[3:25:46] CapDan: thats what they promised. no power to grind for, Im hyped.
[3:25:49] SimonPapeArt: also cosmetics can be its whole seperate system, with dying armor, customizing spells etc
[3:25:55] EKS90_: Im looking forward to log an alt and dont have to do the 5-6 systems before it feels good to play. that is gonna be a refreshing thing again. @Towelliee
[3:26:05] SpyCrabbo: maybe someday we'll get more for m+ than multiple recolors of the same mount
[3:26:06] figsaregood: WoW cosmetics are severely outdated at this point, it's a major issue
[3:26:19] Jay_Vee_NL: man i cant wait to fly that fast!
[3:26:21] remixonfire91: a battle pass kind of system with the new renow doesnt sound bad tbh
[3:26:22] Ceroxyo: i dont mind the hardcore grinds etc, but please make it accbound so my alts wont suffer when i want to play one @Towelliee
[3:26:23] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @edohran (warning)
[3:26:23] dreamwalker213: @commander_eggi I love the “just don’t do it” people lol. Like, I would if I could buddy
[3:26:31] awkswow: They should've just readded titanforging. It works for Destiny. There's not really that much content in destiny but people do it to chase the rare roll. No need for a "system"
[3:26:32] remixonfire91: where they could introduce new rewards every new seasson
[3:26:41] MonarchTeaV: I’m just glad (from what we have seen thus far) no big gold sinks.
[3:26:44] xseaka: They should make exploring worthwhile again, I've played other games recently where exploration is actually rewarded and it feels nice.
[3:27:14] Buzzz_Light_Beer: Do you think that there will be a fishing dragon
[3:27:15] edohran: Can I post a link to an image?
[3:27:36] EKS90_: @dreamwalker213 yeah launch of SL missing 1 week of torghast meant 1 late week on tgetting legendaries etc  it was not fun.
[3:27:52] bllynni6614: I'm hoping they have a good amount of "secrets" go to get and find like legion did.

[3:28:05] temp3st98: yeah most mmos released or releasing have great cosmetics for doing world content. Tower of fantasy has % based per zone for exploration and collecting
[3:28:17] Gingerprimer: @Commander_Eggi not having to grind renown and torghast on an alt will be nice
[3:28:23] cheatsmcgee: Could they just make ring of blood's instanced?
[3:28:28] Chronine: tower of fantasy KEKW
[3:28:48] iLiveInsideCoF: u could get like half way from 66 to 67 in one ring of blood
[3:28:50] egraves7: they did in mop, made it a scenario
[3:28:52] json_dotcom: dragontower
[3:29:02] epiczplz: sounds like classic ring of blood to me. wouldnt be the same without it
[3:29:12] EKS90_: @Gingerprimer yes exactly, like im starting to play my warlock, and i wanna pvp, but i dont have any legenadries and my rrenown isnt max and etc etc etc   It feels annoying.
[3:29:14] ForgottenTime: like 25%
[3:29:16] Jarlan23: yea same
[3:29:19] mavericks312: quarter
[3:29:23] JoeyGfreshness: deathminfire1986 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[3:29:23] raldrik: lol nuke tickled him
[3:29:31] EKS90_: @Gingerprimer "time to go do the ZM campaign again"
[3:29:36] violentmeme: I think they should bring back single boss raid encounters like onyxia and make shorter overaall raids.
[3:30:11] Yagr6: nathria was a good difficulty imo
[3:30:14] MonarchTeaV: malygos remade but with dragonflying POG
[3:30:24] Jarlan23: i want like 7-8 boss raids with something like gruuls lair in the .5 patches
[3:30:35] dyslexican1: * bosses feels like a sqeet spot. So long as there isnt 1000 trash pulls!
[3:30:39] Rulem: I always liked VoA and wintergrasp connection
[3:30:41] dyslexican1: 8*
[3:30:41] chickdrummer88: towKawaii good morning
[3:30:45] the_general01: how long did it take to bring azhara down?

[3:31:15] Jarlan23: yea no more 2 lust fights please
[3:31:17] Jarlan23: i hate that shit
[3:31:17] Mister_Ript: No more 13 minutes Sylvanas fights?  lmao yesss
[3:31:23] Buzzz_Light_Beer: Do you feel that global warming will be included in the expansion
[3:31:23] spookychefkarolina: @chickdrummer88 gm towHAMUP
[3:31:34] strike879: my idea for keeping filled raid zones but keep trash clearing down is have npc kill trash for you so you can choose to trash clear for BoE or activate for fast boss attempt
[3:31:38] mavericks312: we need another 15 minute fight lol
[3:31:38] reggiepowa: im fine with last or last 2 bosses being over 10 min
[3:31:50] Mitune: denathrius is the longest a fight should be
[3:31:53] violentmeme: sylvanas was way too long esp when most of the prog happens in p3
[3:31:58] Templexx: trailer voiceover inc
[3:32:03] SlippieSlik: I enjoy the 10-15 min encounters as long as they are fun and enjoyable... (note the dancing in Castle Nath)
[3:32:04] Ceroxyo: they could just seperate a single boss fight in phases just like lost ark does
[3:32:06] Gingerprimer: @Mitune big true
[3:32:07] DubakuMatumbo: POGULI
[3:32:08] TSquadSully: clip it

[3:32:11] Mister_Ript: Thematic cutscenes with lore-critical characters just AFK auto-attacking between cutscenes lmao
[3:32:14] dyslexican1: fight the "finnal booss! in his finnal form!" 72 mins later! you wipe and have to do it all over again!
[3:32:14] Rulem: thats like ff14 raids/ults; just make them super long
[3:32:14] ZeusDNA: Need to hear a Brother in that voice
[3:32:15] Eregbueye: 69 boss raid
[3:32:16] CasualTryhrd: consider my timbers shivered
[3:32:16] Jarlan23: @reggiepowa it makes me wanna quit progging the last parts of a fight when its over 10 min long
[3:32:17] MonarchTeaV: to be fair i think the last raid should be the longest
[3:32:18] Molvonos: @Towelliee Infinite Dragonflight bringing back Sylvanas.  Called it here first.
[3:32:19] SpoofAvatar: I want a 3 LUST boss
[3:32:19] mistr_pockets: 20min give us two lusts at least
[3:32:26] Thoreya: no one complained about 11 bosses before SOFO dropped LUL
[3:32:26] grizzlyhorn: last boss is 24 minutes with a break timer in the middle
[3:32:27] Arendiel_: KEKW
[3:32:31] Yagr6: 3 boss raids were cool too

[3:32:42] spookychefkarolina: Eighteen minutes towPog towCry
[3:32:43] brian_777777777: if the big dragon is hard and takes a long time i dont mind
[3:32:44] xhaven: you know next xpac after dragonflight everyone will complain raids are too short and dumbed down however! LUL
[3:32:44] lithium364: @Towelliee by that definition the murozond fight this expansion could be between 1 min and 1 hour since timetravel
[3:32:44] reggiepowa: @Jarlan23 idk what to tell you, those bosses are usually the most fun for me
[3:32:48] Mitune: Sylvannas was disgusting in terms of length
[3:32:50] Molvonos: @chickdrummer88 towSip
[3:32:52] WhiteU: @Towelliee have you heard that lirik is gonna be a father?
[3:32:54] SimonPapeArt: pray it brother
[3:33:00] MonarchTeaV: i think the optional hard modes aka ulduar we're some of the best designed boss fights made
[3:33:03] mavericks312: @Thoreya right ppl love ulduar lol
[3:33:06] MonarchTeaV: yogg is a great example
[3:33:14] oRiie: Got a table of people sitting around thinking about creating fights that require 10 new weakauras to even complete
[3:33:20] strike879: they can do that with a split boss like deathwing you had spine and madness same boss diffrent fights
[3:33:38] dyslexican1: Nyalotha was dope, and felt epic in there, but they did not balance that place well for sure.
[3:33:41] LunaKura: @Towelliee How about a M+ for Mythic raids? Your "key" goes up only if you complete the full raid on that key.
[3:34:33] cheatsmcgee: How long was the garrosh fight in MoP? I always loved that fight
[3:34:50] MonarchTeaV: for as much hate as people give dragonsoul it was still better than castle
[3:34:50] robertjordan83: @Towelliee please tell me you've been saying this on the influencer discord
[3:34:53] smashwow: bridges of slyvannas. blah
[3:34:55] Mitune: Phase 2 didnt need to happen either LUL
[3:34:56] Mhyrol: @Towelliee How long was LK? it was epic as f but was longer then Sire
[3:34:57] ninjasquirtlee: star auger in nighthold was short and epic. More of that
[3:35:03] smashwow: p1 of slyvannas blah
[3:35:04] Fortuitas: Sylv phase 2 sucked too
[3:35:10] Recool94: sylvanas fight was boring af
[3:35:13] Moobot: Tamz_tv, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:35:14] xhaven: I liked phase 1 Syl FeelsBadMan
[3:35:18] Senile_Preacher: phase 2 was cool but it was a bit too long
[3:35:19] Jarlan23: sire p1 was awful just because you had to constantly hold dps
[3:35:21] violentmeme: p1 is almost 4 -5 min -- sylvanas needed a checkpoint lol
[3:35:21] Twilight_Knight_: Anything with Sulvanis is totally needed.. WutFace
[3:35:22] brian_777777777: have you seen any not living dragons
[3:35:23] smashwow: the 4 bridges not needed
[3:35:35] Crypticedge: give me DH treeeeeees reeeeeeeeeee
[3:35:35] LunaKura: Phase 1 and 2 for Sylvanas should been only half as long.
[3:35:40] thekalazar: "I dont care if it just lasts 6 minutes as long as every second is epic as fuck" - man, wow raids and sex have a lot in common
[3:35:45] chickdrummer88: @tamz_tv LUL sorry
[3:35:49] violentmeme: lol how are you going to have a 15 min fight where most of the prog is on the last 3-4 min
[3:35:50] haveachub: fights that long dont need to be a thing.  15 min fights are ridic.  Wipe at minute 9 and its incredibly annoying to know you have to do another 9 mins before you even get to the part you have to work on
[3:35:57] dschmidt: @Jarlan23 100% - anytime you have to hold DPS is a BIG fail
[3:36:01] sirryisly: One Boss Raid Takes 2 hours to finish, optimal raiding
[3:36:02] Mitune: The primalist fight is gonna be fun
[3:36:05] dyslexican1: Phase 2 should have been the lead up to actualyl fighting her. Like the "trash" before her. then the Sylvanas fight shoudl have been phase 3. Maybe a second phase added there.
[3:36:15] LeDerpski: I think any fight where you can lust twice is too long.
[3:36:16] yuvalal: what do you mean Banerino in the title ?
[3:36:36] dyslexican1: That whole first phase was garbage!
[3:36:42] Naxder: Naxder subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:36:49] haveachub: @LeDerpski yep
[3:36:51] og_gt710: could've done so much more with the whole xpac
[3:36:55] PlagueHit: I'm curious if there will be new skills for dh or full same passives.
[3:36:59] Perseus_IRL: guys remember the lich king fight..
[3:37:04] Perseus_IRL: different phases
[3:37:08] oRiie: If they want to do these filler phases I think that's fine they should just make a checkpoint after you get passed it once. Keeps with the theme and you don't have to do the pointless piece over n over
[3:37:12] Utmost777: good riddance, RMT should be perma imo
[3:37:20] Daveybutter: @towelliee did you ever get into Better Call Saul?
[3:37:22] Yagr6: if you ban them then un ban them , then there is no real punishment for RMT
[3:37:27] Kneckt: @UtmostOwnage most of it was accidental bans
[3:38:01] yuvalal: we can see in game chat
[3:38:08] KyleEverett: @oRiie FF14 raids have check points all the time
[3:38:15] grizzlyhorn: good show, sucks the last season isnt on netflix
[3:38:16] Utmost777: @Kneckt lol of course, Bliz can't even ban right Kappa KEKW
[3:38:26] Kneckt: @UtmostOwnage KEKW
[3:38:42] mavericks312: @KyleEverett but ff14 treats there raid bosses like single player boss fights
[3:38:44] violentmeme: sandman is on netflix -- pretty good.
[3:38:45] bllynni6614: did u end up watching the sandman?

[3:55:21] zeitgeiz: it's nice, but they just need to accept more people will play if they increase it at all times by 100%. all my friends moved servers, no way i pay to move there or spend that much time leveling
[3:55:21] dreamwalker213: If you’re used to the grind that is classic leveling, the 50% buff makes me feel better
[3:55:24] tenmillion: on the other hand the large percent boosts fuck up the flow of your questing. a lot more running around
[3:55:26] Kneckt: wonder when we will get the login screen
[3:55:32] kay0234: Hey @Towelliee. Sorry if this question has been asked previously. How much do you think regional AH is going to affect people that gather a lot? Do you think the prices are going to go down drastically of consumables?
[3:55:37] JRobezzz: @AveragePvp I thought so, I think that goes live with pre-patch. So that makes leveling really fast
[3:55:39] Jimbo_Beanz: where is the link to confirm plz?

[4:12:34] Cakepriest: heroic isn't hardcore or semi hardcore. Heroic is just casual still.

[4:23:52] dyslexican1: Would be cool if Steed has one path that makes it last longer, or gives you two charges and the other makes your whole raid move faster when you proc it.

[4:55:53] IianaDRK: u cant boost a character on the fresh servers btw. keep that in mind
[4:55:53] dreamwalker213: For classic, 50% feels so much better. At least imo
[4:56:18] IianaDRK: least not for 90s after servers go up
[4:56:20] Tiamarilien: Well, at least the xp works.  :)
[4:56:21] IianaDRK: 90 days*
[4:56:22] warbringer159: got 60 in 2 days played with 50% buff..
[4:56:25] ventu105: gonna watch @Towelliee stream and check classic
[4:56:31] yuvalal: what about the vendor items? do they scale ?
[4:56:33] SLoPPYALieN: and heirloom gear really doesn't do that much with it too

[4:56:53] Jarlan23: theyre doing it 50% faster
[4:56:54] Krue_Sr: 50% faster
[4:56:56] Jarlan23: Kappa
[4:56:56] Krue_Sr: :)
[4:56:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: battlegrounds give xp in prepatch, and during the weekend events it can be a lot for win and decent for a loss
[4:57:03] Dirtnose: its so slow still, idk. I dunno how people cap so many chars on classic. Shit takes an age
[4:57:03] Arendiel_: Jokerd KEKW
[4:57:05] MonTRayZ: 50% with 200% rest is god mode
[4:57:06] DarkviperTV: lol

[4:57:11] yuvalal: @Towelliee  can you checkthe Timewalking vendor?  to check if it scaled?
[4:57:20] SLoPPYALieN: @MonTRayZ Yeah that was great...
[4:57:24] Krue_Sr: Could be slower due to the xp gain decrease with out leveling areas or quests
[4:57:25] Shattermare: Are Monk trees out tonight?
[4:57:26] warbringer159: with 50% xp buff 60 in classic was about under a week /played if u go hard, now its about 2 days
[4:57:31] SLoPPYALieN: I made a toon, and just let it sit until I had time... then BOOOOOM
[4:57:31] Jarless: its roughly 30% quicker if u follow a route
[4:57:34] IianaDRK: correct
[4:57:38] imTymp: basicallly gonna level in 2/3's of the time compared to normal
[4:57:39] IianaDRK: thats my plan
[4:57:42] doomester: @Towelliee how did you combine the bags, tried it and didnt know how @Towelliee
[4:58:03] jaws120: not correct you can make one whenever, no need for 55. they changed it (even for fresh)
[4:58:10] plankdemi: I thought that you could create first dk regardless of your level @Towelliee
[4:58:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: the start zone for dk is a rest zone
[4:58:12] dreamwalker213: You don’t need to have a 55 anymore
[4:58:16] IianaDRK: @jaws120 u need level 55. i tested it on the ptr
