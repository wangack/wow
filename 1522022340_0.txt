[1:35:32] tronbadgames: they're in the maw
[1:35:37] rosina_scarlett: you should have a quest item to use though
[1:35:40] redraidah: unpopular opinion but i really like zul drak
[1:35:45] Rottencoarse: all 3 are in crystalsong forest @Towelliee
[1:35:48] redraidah: cool theme cool layout some shit quests though

[1:37:22] Sollice: Good morning everyone
[1:38:19] redraidah: another unpopular opinion but i dont think people want hard raid/dungeons either. they want cool loot and interesting bosses. ive raided both mythic and classic wow and i have so much more fun in classic raids just messing around
[1:38:30] ohgodimsobad: Yeah, they'd have to rework the mechanics

[1:40:09] BlewGamingGroup: theyre talking about using Season of Mastery mechanics ... all SoM is ... is a consumables shitfest
[1:40:37] rosina_scarlett: I'm going to enjoy the PvP fight in TOGC
[1:40:46] redraidah: scrap ruby sanctum give us something extra. what if they made icc a two parter like thanos. LK kills us at the end of ICC as he planned and the next raid we beat him

[1:41:30] kiroslays: Happy Fourth bro!!!
[1:41:34] redraidah: because economies have not sustained themselves
[1:41:46] BlewGamingGroup: they are talking about putting it in for naxx 2.0 cause the first time around it was too easy ... /facepalm

[1:44:37] LeGoogs: SOM was still super easy
[1:44:40] BlewGamingGroup: @redraidah yea . in order to raid in SoM ... you literally have to go in with a backpack full of consumables
[1:44:44] Korupcija_: I forgot it exists
[1:44:51] Thoreya: The idea was cool though
[1:45:07] redraidah: @roadrrunnerr1 yeah annoying
[1:45:12] Gingerprimer: Not really
[1:45:19] Korupcija_: they should've made only one server imo

[1:45:29] BoezIRL: som?
[1:45:34] redraidah: they just didnt change enough. kill a harder version of rag for the same loot? i didnt come for a hard raid.
[1:45:40] redraidah: i came to hang out with friends and get cool loot
[1:46:39] Gingerprimer: Yeah wow is not FFXIV wow is a loot game
[1:46:49] redraidah: i feel like season of mastery was an attempt to get more retail players to try it, but they view classic as cringe theyll never do it
[1:46:57] raye_gaming22: i mean us good raider would go for it bads wont
[1:47:09] redraidah: im okay with a hardmode for each boss and if you get it you get bonus loot and maybe earn a cosmetic for yourself
[1:47:23] Sarocus: dunno. mage tower was kinda popular
[1:47:29] dkapocalypse: that is wow in a nutshell
[1:48:01] Gingerprimer: @Sarocus yes but also MT was easier than Mythic raid
[1:48:09] sshadeh: tmogs are loot, mount drops are loot
[1:48:10] LeGoogs: @Sarocus Mage tower was a single boss, with a wep appearance to flex. I wouldn't want to do a whole raid just for cosmetics.
[1:48:13] sshadeh: pets are loot oftne
[1:48:17] thymos_: loot PepeClap gimme loot PepeClap
[1:48:21] dkapocalypse: its all about the loot the loot
[1:48:24] raye_gaming22: raid mage tower with equalized would be good but pre nerf tuned with some sick consmetics
[1:48:29] BlewGamingGroup: SoM would have been better if they would have just added more loot to the drops . instead of dropping 3 epics ... have it drop 5 or double/triple the gold to help offset the consumables
[1:48:57] Ithylz: Very hard to change people's mentality in general
[1:49:11] khadayifchi: do i see wrng or u have double seal?

[1:52:11] tronbadgames: pvp rewards in a nutshell lol
[1:52:12] redraidah: the loop is broken
[1:52:18] Korupcija_: I do wish mythic is as accessible as TBC raids
[1:52:26] Broomba: Pandering
[1:52:35] George2001k: I am waiting for the super extra mythic mode‚Ä¶
[1:52:41] sitmeee: people are lazy and think they deserve what someone who no lifes the game has
[1:52:44] raye_gaming22: bring back server first titles and shit im down
[1:52:51] Vanhoek: is the vendor for Cold weather flying tome there yet?
[1:52:56] thymos_: solo conent would be nice yeah
[1:52:57] thymos_: like D3
[1:53:07] warrenny: @korupcija_ Thats why we have normal and heroic tho
[1:53:08] Zettabyte: Single player? Don't get EA on that stuff Kappa
[1:53:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it's the trees
[1:53:17] redraidah: maybe im alone here but i really dont get a hard on for a hard raid or boss and ive killed some mythic bosses. i care about the big item dropping and it going to the right person. i will log on bc every week for an easy raid to fool around with buddies and see what we get
[1:53:28] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the big trees for the energy
[1:53:30] sshadeh: northrend without flying is kinda nightmarish at best
[1:53:31] lirly__: they should just make "casual WoW", where everything is 100% drop rate and all content is one difficulty, just to stop twitter moaning about it LUL
[1:53:39] Xsilentghost: How long do you predict Alpha to be for DF with th expac releasing this year
[1:53:41] Effin_Steffin: @Towelliee what do you think the Golden Age of WoW was, when everything was perfect?
[1:53:42] tronbadgames: torghast.. such a flop
[1:53:45] CardinalTX: Could have done that with Torghast
[1:53:46] jtobiaz: jtobiaz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 112 months! Hammers up! That is all
[1:53:48] redraidah: @poggz__one you gotta phone?
[1:53:58] George2001k: The way you make a completely optional mythic version of heroic mode is to keep the ilvl from mythic the same as from heroic but offer an achievement and a title. Just the]at for mythic raiders.
[1:54:01] dkapocalypse: ap grinding was fun for me
[1:54:03] George2001k: That*
[1:54:08] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee also if not enogh ppl engage in the mythic content at some point blizzard will be like why do we even spend time on designing this stuff
[1:54:13] Kakotan2143: @Xsilentghost it isnt coming out this year
[1:54:24] lirly__: @redraidah no, i threw it at the wall after reading twitter KEKW
[1:54:27] CardinalTX: If there is progression ill do it.
[1:54:32] redraidah: @Towelliee do you think theres even a small chance to get DF before jan 1st or they just said that to sell preorders and they will delay
[1:54:38] BlewGamingGroup: would have been great if they could have implemented something like that into torghast .. it would have been a lot better
[1:54:40] Puppette: or the bee mount questing. completely optional but super rewarding grind
[1:55:08] raye_gaming22: still baffels me why they dont make someting like mage tower its such a low hanging fruit
[1:55:11] warrenny: Archmage challenge sucks
[1:55:33] ArcaneMaki: I have fond memories of getting my man bear form from the mage tower
[1:55:43] epiczplz: people are really upset over raiding? yikes
[1:55:55] redraidah: i like the idea of mage tower but i wish it was more of a mechanics test. the idea that i have to find old gear with gem slots and gem it out for one fight is just stupid and gimmicky

[1:56:37] tronbadgames: too many business decisions too few creative
[1:56:52] sshadeh: LUL
[1:56:53] raye_gaming22: @redraidah it was back in the day with nighthold gear the Sl tower is a joke compered to on ilevel Ligeon tower
[1:56:55] NieIas: its crazy that TBC classic has 30x more parses than SoFo
[1:56:55] sshadeh: yeah
[1:56:59] sshadeh: they could experiment
[1:57:00] Rudric_Ice: most of the casual i know they do is m+
[1:57:07] sshadeh: if the affixes turn shit, they can think of new ones again
[1:57:16] Nebulizer87: Like morbius data anyalytics tracking a trend so they rerelease and still performs bad
[1:57:18] redraidah: @chizu_gaming even the end of llegion it was pretty cheese
[1:57:26] sshadeh: its accessible
[1:57:32] Nebulizer87: M+ has so much potential and they have been so stagnant
[1:57:35] sshadeh: all you need is key and 4 people
[1:57:38] szble: mythic plus needs fun affixes
[1:57:46] ArcaneMaki: Back in Legion, did you do all the classes challenge in the Mage Tower @Towelliee ?
[1:57:47] CardinalTX: gimme some daily log in bonuses of some sort
[1:57:51] redraidah: tbh i hated the dungeons this time i really liked BFA dungeons
[1:58:13] Korupcija_: nice
[1:58:28] sshadeh: the poison dungeon felt horrible with randoms, in shadowlands
[1:58:30] sshadeh: forgot its name
[1:58:32] mmo_kenna_: M+ is flexible you can do runs when you want, raiding and commuting to a guild is a different story
[1:58:40] dkapocalypse: what is 277 placed at
[1:58:53] Orion280: heroic is a yolk
[1:58:53] redraidah: i hate how in bastion dungeon everytime you die you have to take a 2 minute angel plane ride to get back
[1:58:57] redraidah: remove that shit im sorryh
[1:59:42] Gingerprimer: Only Liquid and Echo killed OG Heroic Anduin
[1:59:47] Rudric_Ice: they didn't kill heroic jailer bcuz he didnt drop any tier gear
[1:59:49] raye_gaming22: no sane guild did jailor cuz he fucked the valut we skipped him on purpose and only did 10
[1:59:51] redraidah: i wish i did more mage tower at end of legion when it was easy. i only played dk then and thats all i cared about. and of course the bdk one is like the shittest one
[2:00:42] Rudric_Ice: New world team ?
[2:00:48] redraidah: @Towelliee do you think theres even a small chance to get DF before jan 1st or they just said that to sell preorders and they will delay
[2:00:52] raye_gaming22: like i said you did it the right way why fuckign  valut if oyu need tier with jailor loot
[2:01:06] Xsilentghost: dragon racing events
[2:01:07] mmo_kenna_: Najz and mechagon were brilliant, Shadowlands open world has been shit
[2:01:23] sshadeh: lets see if launch is gonna be another 10 levels in one night trip LUL

[2:01:54] redraidah: thats fucked up though man you shouldnt be able to advertise that to get money and then just tell the players fuck you itll be in march.
[2:01:57] redraidah: should be illegal
[2:02:02] BlewGamingGroup: i dont think they could do it in that short of time ... unless that new team had been there already for a couple of years
[2:02:15] Rudric_Ice: there was a leak where a guy said it will release on Nov 28th the same guy who leaked legion and BFA expansion
[2:02:16] Nebulizer87: Imagine we don‚Äôt have public testing
[2:02:26] warrenny: @sshadeh Its been that way since like cata nothing wrong with that
[2:02:26] raye_gaming22: no way it comes out in december november more likely
[2:02:26] Nebulizer87: That would be so fucking nice to go in blind
[2:02:34] CardinalTX: People that preorder are going to preorder anyway, lets be real. No matter Blizz plan
[2:02:34] redraidah: we did basically lose a raid tier though so maybe thats an extra 2-3 months of working on DF?
[2:02:36] Nebulizer87: I‚Äôm sick of all this testing
[2:02:51] hikaritd: dont know why people are so upset with the short time till launch.. game has been worked on for a loooong time, just give a bigger wave of beta invites and its fine
[2:02:52] sshadeh: @warrenny yeah, its fun in its own way

[2:03:31] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  there are night elf ruins in the area you can find the masonry from them

[2:06:21] terribalgamer: if they aren't doing anything with feedback it doesn't really matter how long the beta is. they are just looking for crit game errors at tat point
[2:06:30] Rudric_Ice: @Towelliee there was a leak where ''The" guy said it will release on Nov 28th the same guy who leaked legion and BFA expansion
[2:07:07] tronbadgames: they should be getting away from the idea of beta invites and all that. stick to targeted test, be pragmatic about having a quality test vs the hype build with beta invite waves etc
[2:07:11] Gingerprimer: @Rudric_Ice that guys Legion leak was BS tho If i remember correctly
[2:07:24] Orion280: i really hope we see more this week man i need to know if evoker will be as fun as i think it will be i wanna see more talent tree's too

[2:17:57] memnon94: Arthur Menethil
[2:18:11] manmower: planning on doing some dragon riding next later this week
[2:18:23] hirsari: if u look at SWP and retail parses, u see that TBC has 10x the amount of parses retail does. It will only be bigger in WOTLK classic
[2:18:32] Nico_vdM: And now for a lot of flying around :)
[2:18:41] manmower: dragon walking
[2:18:42] HulkHogunn: yo
[2:18:52] Lincoln_WoW: i still think the first build is the evoker starting zone
[2:19:02] Gingerprimer: Yeha have fun doing the dracthyr starting zone with the talent tree hidden
[2:19:14] tunaman44: lol
[2:19:22] warrenny: @lincoln_wow Most likely
[2:19:31] Ithylz: @Towelliee How do you think they'll deal with classes which haven't had their talent trees previewed yet? Not available at the start of Alpha? Or they'll have the old talents?
[2:19:33] flebbooo: And go ham we will! :D
[2:19:34] sshadeh: back then we had thousands of variations of the name illidan
[2:19:39] sshadeh: what names will we get now
[2:19:39] HulkHogunn: oh ya brother feed the pythons
[2:19:52] Nico_vdM: This questline has a lot of flying which was very annoying to do at the time
[2:19:53] MrGharr: Do you think they will enable classes one-by-one in the alpha to get targeted feedback on the talenttrees?
[2:19:54] manmower: they don't have to put out much, still have 5+ months until release so plenty of time
[2:19:55] Nico_vdM: For me at least
[2:20:17] Lincoln_WoW: @Ithylz if a class doesn't ahve talents ready for testing, it won't be active on alpha. same as legion alpha/beta

[2:21:03] Xenocide6: Heydir, Hidir, Hodir
[2:21:11] sshadeh: at least the zones seem good looking, so far
[2:21:12] manmower: the talent trees can get feedback just from posting them externally
[2:21:17] lithium364: survival hunter enabled last 3 days of beta
[2:21:37] Nico_vdM: Yes
[2:21:39] SpoofAvatar: yep
[2:21:44] MrGharr: Priest talent tree is such a mess. Utility and throughput are in both trees.
[2:21:47] Nico_vdM: and you try to revive him by going to various people
[2:21:50] warrenny: @manmower Not based or power or useability
[2:21:57] Nico_vdM: By Sindragosa's fall IIRC
[2:22:01] manmower: if ashen hallow makes it to DF, that'll be ridiculous
[2:22:12] EnigmacX: won't it be wiered nax classic raid was around the corner now wotlk nax raid is here feels kinda saturated

[2:22:49] Meowzamere: <3
[2:22:51] thymos_: PepeWhy
[2:22:53] Snabido: Near the battered hilt area, if he's looking for the dude
[2:22:53] Ithylz: @Ithylz That's what I'd guess. Yet I can't help but thinking about how late some classes will be. In Legion and SL, classes that were late in this process got the least feedback and ended up being less polished
[2:23:04] LordKain73: towCry
[2:23:36] Slaanesh74: Bridenbrad questline gets me emotional when the naaru drop what they're doing and come to take him to heaven

[2:25:01] geokouts: not there near Argent Tournament
[2:25:02] CardinalTX: Holly going everquest style with classic......keep reinventing classic and cashing in

[2:26:41] Frank4LuLz: and they deleted Swifty's NPc, he did nothing wrong, justice for swifty
[2:26:41] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[2:31:13] sshadeh: looking bad, pandaria wasnt that bad either
[2:31:15] Nico_vdM: The nice thing is it is now 3 days instead of 7
[2:31:16] sshadeh: back*
[2:31:21] Nico_vdM: So it is a bit easier to get
[2:31:24] Clodagh_Lunaria: MoP was bad ass

[2:57:59] DatSheppy: there was less online inter-connectedness
[2:57:59] tronbadgames: @Towelliee totally.. ventrillo and wow was the way
[2:58:00] Dkgungo: i xfered my shammy on illidan  to alliance  just cause and trade chat is so dead lol
[2:58:02] cahoots82: Elitist Jerks

[2:58:13] xternalwolf: Myspace Kappa
[2:58:13] Mozzeyy_: Very true
[2:58:15] damnbul: vent
[2:58:16] Dkgungo: we had vent and moo champion forums thats all
[2:58:19] YardRage: it's society, maaaaaaaaan
[2:58:28] gren2: @Towelliee there was icq, irc, msn, yahoo, aim, somethingaweful forums, and bodybuidling forums
[2:58:28] Kakotan2143: YES @Towelliee you are correct,
[2:58:33] Dystilled: When I used to raid lead we used team speak and we had to make out own website to do half the stuff you can do on discord now

[2:58:36] M2thew: good old ventrilo
[2:58:45] gren2: Gaia online lol
[2:58:48] Slaanesh74: everyone's trying to promote a brand. it's kind of shameless
[2:58:50] Aurielz: good morning !! happy 4th
[2:58:55] racketpunch: the game has never been more social..its just outside of the game client
[2:59:00] Sudocomm: It's a 100% society, but blizzard helped out with the finder system
[2:59:03] Rudric_Ice: we don't even talk to people IRL when we are outside nowadays we just talk to our phones
[2:59:09] tronbadgames: @Towelliee the sales industry sees something similar with new reps using social media etc, and old boomers thinking everyone only talks on the phone
[2:59:10] swamp_roo: yeah, there was chatrooms and mmos. all the online friends you had back in the day were from online games and chatrooms, no social media.
[2:59:16] DoubleNova: there were messengers
[2:59:31] racketpunch: wow tinder

[2:59:56] manmower: send me your moneys
[2:59:59] M2thew: this still exists lol
[3:00:00] Dystilled: Its actually a similar major issue in the health care industry. Newer nurses like myself use much safer, better techniques, but the older staff rely on what they were taught 20 yrs ago that makes more work for them
[3:00:00] Dkgungo: wait for real?
[3:00:01] happyspot: gamer escort lol

[3:00:39] Stonefather: Men can be hoes too
[3:00:43] TomCat: before any of that, most online interaction was via IRC.  I remember even finding it odd back in the day how people would login to WoW just to use the chat room and never found IRC
[3:00:48] DoubleNova: game pimps
[3:00:54] cahoots82: so are you paying to play with a better player under the guise of playing with someone good looking like a boosting service?
[3:00:54] Frank4LuLz: " i prefer Gamer-Man-Whore"
[3:01:00] Dkgungo: at the end of the day you gotta respect the hustle

[3:01:35] YardRage: maybe with enough filters I can make myself handsome Kappa
[3:01:43] crunchyFrog999: compensated gaming .. sad!
[3:01:49] Redpandalol: Be the gamer beefcake for a older wow lady going through a divorce @towelliee
[3:01:55] Dkgungo: @cryptic8989 why work a shitty job for shitty pay when you can be your own boss doing something you enjoy?
[3:02:05] Korupcija_: league too all the player D:
[3:02:05] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the warhammer online game was around but wrath release killed it
[3:02:07] Korupcija_: took*
[3:02:10] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: 2009
[3:02:11] memnon94: it came out too soon
[3:02:15] Valcrone: hey @Towelliee you on one of those apps? asking for a friend.... lol
[3:02:18] manmower: 2008? more like 2000 and late

[3:03:57] CardinalTX: @gdcotton 100% this......the mmo time sink dosent appeal as much these days
[3:04:08] Stonefather: The market has too many games for any one game to hold that many players nowadays
[3:04:12] emznev: Alpha is today? Kreygasm Kreygasm KomodoHype KomodoHype
[3:04:29] gdcotton: @SixFourBoom yup, unless I have stuff planned I can never sit down to game for more than an hour or 2 now without getting bored too easily
[3:04:44] jeflag: at least 100 dollars
[3:04:48] swamp_roo: attention span of the consumer is lower when you have so much variety. that dopamine fix is easierto get, more access

[3:05:34] PadidinJones: Wait I thought SWTOR was around in WOLK
[3:05:35] manmower: WoW needs to clean up the story and release content faster to hold marketshare IMO
[3:05:36] TomCat: @Tanderstruk it's 3 minutes whether they show 2 ads, 6 ads, or 40
[3:05:38] Ondeman: And LOTRO couldn't really compete
[3:05:43] rev1894: Swtor was 2012
[3:05:45] emznev: how many subs do we think was has now? 6 mil?
[3:05:52] Rakish44: I was still playing some City of Heroes back then along with WoW
[3:05:54] Rudric_Ice: FF got subs when Asmon started to play it realistically speaking
[3:06:02] Blvdman: I think wow would also benefit from shorter seasons

[3:06:57] CardinalTX: Mmmmmm jungle punch
[3:06:59] gdcotton: Not a clue, everyone I knew that played FF during the blizzard shitshow the last 2 years all quit and said they have zero plans to go back, it didnt make them "feel wrapped into the story and involved" which I guess is important for an MMO
[3:07:17] dareetv: how is my favorite streamer doing lately?
[3:07:28] Brae22: Tamara is in the lake
[3:07:33] Nico_vdM: Yes, Professor Vic is at River's Heart where the last taste tester is. @Towelliee
[3:07:52] CardinalTX: Tamara never comes
[3:07:56] emznev: @cryptic8989 FF is crap no one can tell me other wise lol
[3:08:07] dym_jt: by the lcate in the middle of the zone
[3:08:15] Kize_Gaming: Tamara is the day after today Kappa
[3:08:41] Blvdman: I just want a game like code closers + dragonnest + bdo + lost ark content combined, if someone ever makes a game like that. I'd die happy
[3:08:45] rev1894: Could it be argued that Cata was the last alt-friendly expansion wow had. regarding systems you gotta grind when you hit max/legendary timegates, etc..
[3:08:49] emznev: @cryptic8989 ye i agree
[3:08:57] PadidinJones: All talkers
[3:09:00] gdcotton: Read the full message.
[3:09:07] PadidinJones: Even Quinn comes back!! @Towelliee
[3:09:11] Blvdman: osrs and wow will always make me come back
[3:09:15] Rudric_Ice: FF is a good story game WoW is a good non-story game
[3:09:17] NoS_Stumpy: I sure did
[3:09:19] gdcotton: It was directed at people not going back to FF, not WoW
[3:09:27] Stonefather: Well the lore barely exists but.
[3:09:31] DatSheppy: he meant won't go back to FF I think
[3:09:34] RolexKT: Yea I've only been playing 14 to ride out the shit show, I'm already planning to come back next month LUL
[3:09:40] dareetv: if they make a leap to FTP model instead of subscription i will 100% come back. but I really am tired of the subs.
[3:09:41] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: the ff14 maintenance is making me consider returning I mean the sub is kinda cheap
[3:09:46] kimmo_gaming: The Dwagons, like Wabbit season LOL
[3:09:50] Korupcija_: I feel like nobody talked about the story until asmon started final fantasy
[3:09:50] manmower: if the turtle world quests couldn't bring players back, nothing can
[3:09:53] rbolude: why cant the 2 games co-exist smh
[3:10:12] gdcotton: Story doesnt mean much if the game itself is lacking altogether lol

[3:11:41] szble: you wont convince any diehard stan
[3:11:44] Rakish44: thinking about the account management system is enough to make me not return to FFXIV
[3:11:47] Nachozdood: FF14 fans are koolaid drinking Zealots most of the time
[3:11:52] PadidinJones: @cryptic8989 I wasnt gunna say it lol

[3:17:22] Frank4LuLz: toxic shit. like Chernobyl
[3:17:25] TheCliffyShow: Only one game allowed.
[3:17:25] dwhalen2902: His WoW classic chattters and FFXIV chatters are fucking ridiculous in his chat
[3:17:32] kimmo_gaming: Well honestly Nobel should come back, i understand why he didnt play Shadowlands, but he should play DF
[3:17:39] Thoreya: i feel like asmon barely likes FF lowkey lol. he prob wud never play it if it wasnt for stream
[3:17:40] Rudric_Ice: LMAO

[3:17:44] rev1894: daddy bobby KEKW

[3:17:57] Frank4LuLz: respecting the community
[3:18:01] ceranac23: @Thoreya  ye he dont like that shit
[3:18:07] Eregbueye: true
[3:18:13] Skycoh: Most WOW players have left WOW before tho.
[3:18:19] Korupcija_: we go to other wow streamers
[3:18:21] rev1894: they keep lists
[3:18:22] Korupcija_: at least me
[3:18:23] Stonefather: That's because as WoW players we take breaks all the time Keepo
[3:18:23] wyman1990vc: nothing will match wows combat though man
[3:18:30] t_train_va: Hey Towelliee. Not trying to stir up anything, so apologize in advance if this is sensitive. Are you still affiliated with GFuel or no?
[3:18:32] dareetv: yea i've left and rejoined wow like 5 times in 12 years XD
[3:18:34] Snabido: Us wowers understand one does not quit wow, but take a break üòè
[3:18:35] szble: retail wow players not classic andys
[3:18:35] manmower: FF is younger and less mature players than WoW
[3:18:36] Thoreya: i go watch cdew instead LUL
[3:18:37] fat_european0: Yeah, you did that with FF14 when all the lawsuits happened. I just tuned out until you got back to wow content
[3:18:41] memnon94: I don't care what you play, but when you play Wow, I'm here, that's it
[3:18:43] smashwow: like that crazy ex
[3:18:47] drewetling: wow players have no feelings!!
[3:18:51] ozpalo: wow players shit on the game all the time, but FF players are high on COPIUM with their game
[3:18:53] BlewGamingGroup: @Towelliee its happening to Luxthos right now . Variety he was getting 100-150 viewers . now hes back up over 500 his first day back and a shit ton of subs

[3:19:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: tataru doesnt forgive or forget when you leave ff14
[3:19:08] happysadmann: HeyGuys
[3:19:09] Nachozdood: you owe your life to FF now that you have sat and watched 5000000 cut scenes about walking to the guy next to him and talking to him for me
[3:19:13] dwhalen2902: I've gone through FF to the latest Xpac, it's just wild to see how crazy ppl get wanting to watch Asmon react to the MSQ. It's a very uncomfortable dynamic lmao
[3:19:14] aladinsane444: I rememeber when ff andies were angry at Nobbel because he didnt cry during cutscene
[3:19:28] Thoreya: ^ lmfao
[3:19:32] Thoreya: thats funny
[3:19:32] Billo0w: @manmower younger, yes, less mature? no. With how toxic and bully wow players are, they are not mature.
[3:19:47] wyman1990vc: it will be nice when asmongokd is back to playing wow
[3:19:50] Skycoh: True
[3:19:54] szble: she sure can
[3:19:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: she could kill me with snu snu
[3:19:58] Zanmato01: hey @Towelliee do you play with tartarus? do you recommend?
[3:20:02] Stonefather: Dude she's like a billion years old Keepo
[3:20:05] rbolude: @aladinsane444 they were also mad at naguura cause she "looked like she didnt care" about the story lol
[3:20:06] Thoreya: @wyman1990vc he literally played it yesterday on stream lol
[3:20:10] Thoreya: asmon plays wow all the time
[3:20:13] Sydrath90: I sometimes take multiple expansions of breaks. Haven‚Äôt played since legion. Started a month ago in classic for wrath lol
[3:20:24] dwhalen2902: Zepla
[3:20:28] szble: azeroth gonna be a looker
[3:20:33] t_train_va: MTQ, Zepla
[3:20:34] MrGharr: omg luxthos is back? Now i have to refollow
[3:20:48] dwhalen2902: People would bug tf out lmao
[3:20:48] Slaanesh74: KEKW
[3:20:52] BlewGamingGroup: anarchy
[3:20:53] Mozzeyy_: Asmon plays WoW on his alt only because the viewcount is not there
[3:20:54] itsrambo: death threats
[3:20:55] rev1894: world war 4
[3:20:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: honestly they would probably get more viewers LUL
[3:21:08] Havoc_S1: Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[3:21:10] Acinicus: wows just better
[3:21:11] Acinicus: lol
[3:21:12] Nachozdood: i have a feeling FF14 fans are so Zealous because they are trying to prove that the game is worth its  numbers and that it is more then what it is
[3:21:12] PadidinJones: The rage @Towelliee UNSUB REEEEEEEEEEEEE GIMME MY MONEY BACK!
[3:21:23] jeflag: the end of life as we know it
[3:21:40] Varsader: FFXIV is the best fishing simulator I've ever played.
[3:21:40] wunderfunct: I've played FFXIV for years and frankly, it's such bad streaming material. WoW is much better
[3:22:09] wyman1990vc: @thoreya I mean his old streams was literally wow all day...he doesn't play it much now
[3:22:13] Tatuatul: Tatuatul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:22:14] manmower: younger brother syndrome
[3:22:17] Rudric_Ice: @Varsader  u never tried New World Fishing ?
[3:22:26] PadidinJones: They only have to prove that they are not WoW players
[3:22:32] Skycoh: The chip on your shoulder idea blows my mind. It's like car or truck guys. If you dont own a Ford, then youre stupid.
[3:22:37] Varsader: @Rudric_Ice I didn't get the chance to try New World at all. lol
[3:22:43] Korupcija_: KEKW
[3:22:45] Slaanesh74: I think it kind of plays into the anime fan stereotype
[3:22:51] NieIas: why you think preach and asmon have been stalling the MSQ so long. the day to day gameplay is too boring to watch
[3:22:52] theDirtyon3: THD getting people shot by strays out there on Twitter
[3:22:53] Stonefather: If this was BFA I would be one shotting people with Twilight Devastation danSad
[3:22:55] Bayne77: DESTROY THE WEAK!!!
[3:22:57] Slaanesh74: they tend to be more childish and exciteable
[3:22:58] rev1894: blizz knows right now that dragonflight NEEDS to be good
[3:23:00] Thdlock: DEMOLISH THE WEAK
[3:23:01] wunderfunct: FFXIV is about the filler content; it's how it keeps casuals. Raiding is not the true endgame, it's fashion and crafting and housing
[3:23:05] Mozzeyy_: @slaanessh74 what lmao
[3:23:11] Thoreya: lmfaooo
[3:23:17] Thoreya: THD in thehouse
[3:23:18] AlphasaurusRexx: @Varsader i bought New World while it was on sale this weekend. It's actually a fun game so far.
[3:23:21] szble: what you dont like grinding anima gasp
[3:23:24] Nachozdood: lol i remember when you played FF14 when it first relaunched and our server got mad because you left for GTA5 and alot of your followers also split
[3:23:34] Eregbueye: yea but m+ tho.. and way more world content compared to WOD
[3:23:36] Thoreya: give us bfa content back ty
[3:23:46] Slaanesh74: anime/furries/weebs they're all very infantile in their passions
[3:23:46] manmower: they need super cool crafting things to chase
[3:23:51] mavericks312: if the weak die they die lol
[3:23:53] theszoti: hope dragonflight gives us a lot of filler content
[3:23:56] Snabido: Corruption actually not that bad to deal with Kappa
[3:23:57] wunderfunct: @Slaanessh74 Oh yeah, totally
[3:23:58] Narmus_: WoW Legendaries should be like GW2 ones
[3:23:58] PadidinJones: I wish we got back to the class unique stuff like we had in legion.
[3:24:19] killercondon: I wish torghast had more things to do for rewards
[3:24:19] MoJoShMaN: rejoined wow when I saw dragonflight trailer. already got all my tools to max lvl and kinda bored
[3:24:19] MrKhanes: MoP Cloak and WoD Ring was really cool, it was kinda like a relic weapon from FF14
[3:24:32] NieIas: 30 tank Nyalotha with full TD lol
[3:24:35] itsrambo: 3k io?
[3:24:46] TheCliffyShow: Anyone else wish they would show Alexstraza's new in-game elf model already. I wanna see my dragon mommy.
[3:24:49] Slaanesh74: I'm not saying that WoW fans and high fantasy gamers aren't sweaty nerds, but it's a different type of passion

[3:25:52] Varsader: Freya looks like that homeless chick down by the river that you would kinda bang but you worry about what STDs she got.
[3:26:00] emznev: shaodwlands is wod 2.0?
[3:26:07] Kyrrua: not having too much to do means u can play other games or do smth else too, depends
[3:26:11] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Funnty! A bargershop near me is called Cutting Edge KEKW

[3:26:59] dwhalen2902: I've been trying to get caught up into SL. I'm debating whether I should even get back into M+ or just play for the story and begin lvling alts like crazy. I'm not worried about getting high iLVL considering DF will,. drop within the year or so
[3:26:59] ascend_37: i play retail because i like keys but besides that, yeah theres nothing to do

[3:27:56] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:28:06] Sollice: Right but Ion would never say that. That would be way to forward for him lol
[3:28:08] dwhalen2902: @Thoreya Ohhh, I didn't even know that! Maybe I'll try getting 2-3 characters set up for it before it drops and then do a shit ton of alts later. Ty for letting me know!!
[3:28:09] Frank4LuLz: wrap your shit fool

[3:31:13] YardRage: that dog is shopping around for new owners

[3:44:23] Yupmoh: i mean if they are able to implement group finder stuff then they have source code so they could easily do it
[3:44:26] Zettabyte: All we need now @Towelliee, is for WoW to be released on the Switch after DF Kappa

[3:48:17] Yupmoh: cold weather 68
[3:48:28] spencernpp: cold weather cacta
[3:48:30] spencernpp: i thought
[3:48:34] abe4th: do we think there will be a boost around pre patch? Tried to find some info but nothing solid.
[3:48:40] notColt45: mobs do respawn pretty fast in wrath zones
[3:48:51] elemxntals_: @abe4th blue post said 50%xp boost
[3:48:55] McLeod25: how intense do you think the layering is gonna be on launch?
[3:49:03] Nachozdood: lol tanks gonna solo dungeons
[3:49:09] abe4th: @elemxntals_ Ah so no character boost like TBC then?
[3:49:10] Short_Film: Doggie ASMR

[3:49:21] PrimalBF: <3
[3:49:24] elemxntals_: @abe4th as of now its uncomfirmed, but rumors say 68 boost
[3:49:28] GroovyBryan: GroovyBryan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:49:33] abe4th: @elemxntals_ Awesome thank you!
[3:49:35] Goiur: dog zen channel
[3:49:42] CardinalTX: Thunderbuddy treats with hemp do the trick for our dog
[3:49:46] warrenny: @elemxntals_ Most likely tbc was 58 boost
[3:49:49] Sudocomm: They make noise canceling head phones for dogs that look like boxing head gear
[3:49:51] BlewGamingGroup: if yer not going to dungeon spam all the way to 80 is to dungeon spam the first few hours so that the wave of people at launch gets out out of the starter zones and then go back and do them once the initial wave moves on
[3:49:58] almostdps: thats theta
[3:49:58] Nachozdood: lol dont press the button!
[3:50:05] warrenny: Will wrath boost work pn belfs?
[3:50:21] druidiful: wrong area?

[3:50:52] warrenny: @nachozdood belf pally undead or belf lock
[3:50:54] JeffsStolenBike: Will the boost have an option to select two professions? I can't remember if the TBC boost did or not.
[3:50:54] almostdps: northwest, makers perch
[3:51:01] temp3st98: top left - right and bottom
[3:51:02] Yupmoh: @Thoreya agreed

[3:51:35] Nachozdood: @warrenny just keep in mind the gear they gave to boosted characters in BC was hot trash will likely be the same for this one
[3:51:45] warrenny: @zanmato01 Thats what im thinking undecided atm tho

[3:52:35] BlewGamingGroup: think so . we got max first aid when we made death knights on this beta . that was it
[3:52:46] Thoreya: wow twitter has lost their gone damn mind
[3:52:49] warrenny: @nachozdood Tbh if i have time ill level both but i dunno
[3:52:49] NieIas: cuz ppl are bored
[3:52:51] Thoreya: DF alpha needs to get here asap
[3:52:55] almostdps: if they make wow like elden ring im quitting
[3:52:56] rev1894: its so interesting how first aid use to be really useful for some classes, nowadays all classes have self heals
[3:53:26] Bayne77: elden ring is shite
[3:53:36] tronbadgames: @Towelliee might as well talk about mario lol
[3:53:36] PvtHudson093: social in elden ring amounts to leaving Finger But Whole messages everywhere
[3:53:37] Thoreya: end of expansion times got everyone in shambles
[3:53:40] TheCliffyShow: Sounds like someone who just wanted to talk about Elden Ring.
[3:53:40] Nachozdood: @warrenny Blizz will be dropping a hefty XP boost soon to help ppl lvl and catch up alts
[3:53:49] Rudric_Ice: @bayne77   broooo
[3:53:54] Scraggersmeh: Elden ring has basically 0 social interaction lol
[3:54:14] Nachozdood: only thing Elden ring and wow have in common really is they are both open world
[3:54:18] CardinalTX: My John Deere tractor is better than your schwin bycycle!
[3:54:20] thetruegodofwarr: and PVP
[3:54:21] Scraggersmeh: The Co-Op is really basic.
[3:54:25] warrenny: @nachozdood Ik i heard just unsure about if 8 have enough time
[3:54:32] almostdps: @Scraggersmeh it has "warmode"
[3:54:35] abracka_: maybe they were trying to make a case for more solo challenges? that's realistically the only thing i can think of lol
[3:54:36] Rudric_Ice: u can pvp
[3:54:37] mmrghost7: i hope to DH tree asap
[3:54:41] Nowaayjose: halo 2 has more social interaction than shadowlands reeeeeeeeeeee
[3:55:11] PvtHudson093: but "Finger But Whole"
[3:55:26] TheCliffyShow: I thought you couldn't pause in Souls games.
[3:55:44] Rudric_Ice: DO THIS IRL PotFriend
[3:55:45] almostdps: @abracka_ the WoW community would hate that though, if anything cool was locked behind it at least.
[3:56:03] Korupcija_: but I want to go even FASTER
[3:56:05] JeffsStolenBike: Azeroth auto pilot makes 50-60 like 4 hours
[3:56:13] warrenny: Its not much more then that to50 tbh
[3:56:17] TheCliffyShow: 6 hours and still not fast enough. Could take 6 minutes, and people would be like, "it takes to long to level".
[3:56:36] warrenny: @thecliffyshow Theyre not mmo fans then
[3:56:40] mentulgg: what do you think tthe highest the percent will go with anniv event
[3:56:42] Scraggersmeh: 20 hours? It barely takes 4-5 hours max.
[3:56:44] NieIas: hope they do the same with late BFA like different buff every week till prepatch
[3:56:47] almostdps: Blizz should just give me free lvl 60 boosts once i hit 60 once, i earned it - take #14523
[3:57:30] Cafe0le: 4 zones as big as the whole northrend OMEGALUL
[3:57:38] silentknight190: the verision of wotlk releasing  is dual spec still 5k g and to fly in northrend 5k g? @towelliee
[3:57:49] HaloS23: Happy 4th All!!!
[3:57:49] YardRage: they can make it free, or they can print money LUL
[3:57:56] fooxytv: What are your thoughts on levelling to 70 again in Dragonflight? @towelliee
[3:58:00] almostdps: its more making fun of people on reddit that say stuff like that
[3:58:01] Snaxsalot: Judge to the sox? @Towelliee
[3:58:05] Snabido: Every free thing from blizz costs a piece of your soul üòè
[3:58:09] Tschetter21: I took a break from half way through Panda and started again at the start of Shadowlands only to come back to 0 characters and Blizz said they won't look into why everything was gone. Started levelling and got 3 lvl 60 characters in a week. There is no need for xp boosts in retail
[3:58:10] misomander: it wouldnt be a terrible gold sink in todays economy
[3:58:18] Dkgungo: hit 60 farm gold buy tokens buy boosts thats what i do
[3:58:24] Nachozdood: for me i dont think the lvling time is ever an issue its the pacing of the content im consuming to hit max lvl that feels like it draaaags on for ever
[3:58:27] sonusrave: Is wow worth the subscription cost overall?
[3:58:29] CardinalTX: Hell just give some log in rewards
[3:58:29] gali5656: dual spec pretty sure was 1k gold
[3:58:31] Goiur: I would be happy with a fee cut of 50% after all this years at 13 per month haha
[3:58:32] warrenny: Company making money? Despicable
[3:58:33] rbailey_2222: no dk lvling?
[3:58:54] PenaaliTursas: Do u guys think that there will be Wotlk pass ? same as the TBC portal thingy with 1 char boost?

[4:03:12] almostdps: back to scholozar
[4:03:27] rev1894: 8 ads :O
[4:03:34] anlizardking: @DanceFloorGhost sweet!
[4:03:52] Dkgungo: @kaizoku_ow what adds kappa
[4:04:24] warrenny: @dkgungo What are adds? Kappa
[4:04:52] Zanmato01: @DanceFloorGhost i think you'll still have to level to 55 before
[4:05:02] Zanmato01: with another class
[4:05:08] Nachozdood: i wish you could skip adds on twitch like you can on youtube watching a 30sec add isnt going to make me buy old spice
[4:05:12] Zanmato01: to unlock dk on fresh server
[4:05:14] Tschetter21: Twitch is almost being smart. All they have to do is promote turbo along side the ads of MGK and they should sell turbo like crazy
[4:05:44] Dkgungo: @Zanmato01 on fresh server yes new server there is no requirement
[4:06:07] Dkgungo: @Zanmato01 i mean old server no requirement

[4:10:47] rbolude: the auction house thing
[4:11:08] Nachozdood: the terminology for retail is so dumb now...it should be called modern wow because classic servers are now retail
[4:11:13] j_Soft: everyone johnin for classic?
[4:11:26] Balkidar: You're not that guy!
[4:11:44] manmower: gonna hurt bots
[4:11:45] Mallaes: Pretty much
[4:11:47] TheRiwen: yes
[4:11:48] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee there will be a price balance for stackable items
[4:11:54] martianxl: Yep.  It should help the smaller servers get better prices.
[4:11:57] Xara36: or the gold farmers will stop focusing on mats
[4:11:58] AlphasaurusRexx: yeah. no longer have to spend a stupid amount on potions
[4:11:59] Nachozdood: blizz should just make mega servers a thing now and stop dancing around it
[4:11:59] TheRiwen: but it will be a good for low pop servers
[4:12:03] Goldni007: probably going to kill gathering
[4:12:05] xALcaPWNedx: modern wowfare
[4:12:49] Anakinxd: It will change demand/supply on the low populated servers to probably be better for the "market"
[4:12:57] Exodeo_: megaserver would just give you a new firemaw situation
[4:12:59] Sprowa: more lag PoG
[4:13:03] almostdps: mythic raids would be the only thing affected right?
[4:13:03] manmower: except when they apply phasing
[4:13:15] Zettabyte: But server identity! ;(
[4:13:16] Nachozdood: they have half of it set up now as it is though
[4:13:25] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee I just logged into retail... is the wow token super high at 220k for U.S. ?
[4:13:26] AlphasaurusRexx: cant even have a 40v40 open world pvp session without insane lag
[4:13:29] fireballmagnet: how much they charging you for flying then in WOTLK i forget
[4:13:29] dewking93: i play on a dead server

[4:54:52] Cmgaming7: in what way
[4:54:53] gritbarontv: i'll take legion over BC
[4:54:59] ambiotic: BFA is prob 4 for me since I am crazy
[4:55:11] Crumikz: Tbc Wrath Mist Legion
[4:55:11] manmower: I'd take BFA over BC
[4:55:15] Ojomon_: bc is like 5th
[4:55:15] abracka_: here comes the salt over a personal opinion
[4:55:19] Vondrex: 1.BC 2. Wrath 3. Mop
[4:55:22] Cmgaming7: in the time you played it ok i got ya
[4:55:23] Sollice: Legion may be my #1 but I wish there was 1 maybe 2 more dungeons in irt
[4:55:38] Cmgaming7: because just lore wise wrath is number one to me
[4:55:41] gritbarontv: i still remember the broken states of Vanilla and BC, i heated the combat bashing system.
[4:55:47] doomkry: i still think bfa with some tweaks would be a awesome expansion
[4:55:54] Visinatrix: I loved the lore behind the artifact weapons in legion, collecting them on alts gave me something to do
[4:55:56] sitmeee: WoD was BiS
[4:56:08] fatherfrag: I started at the end of Mists so WAD is my jam. So im excited for the new Mythic+ season

[4:56:28] Aveziele: for me TBC was one of the worse expansions :D map was like... designed by a drunkard who was high af :D Black Temple was awesome but one raid wont save a whole expansion
[4:56:31] ambiotic: i miss corruption :(
[4:56:37] nightmayor12: Classic BFA when?

[4:58:02] Cmgaming7: i enjoyed shadowlands at the beginning but it dropped so far
[4:58:10] Nachozdood: Yikes you didnt like cata that much? why?
[4:58:14] Ell_der: What for you makes BFA rank so highly ?
[4:58:20] Exodeo_: I just hate the sl zones
[4:58:28] zeitgeiz: WoD class design was so good, so sad the rest of the xpac failed
[4:58:32] nightmayor12: Can I get a hit of that COPIUM bro?

[4:58:45] Necrom93: Firelands was so good
[4:58:51] mmo_kenna_: Cata was ambitious atleast
[4:58:55] Skycoh: Cata was a good change of pace. Literally changed the whole world.
[4:59:01] killercondon: I just want gladiator stance back in warrior talent tree
[4:59:03] Timothious: I quit in cata came back for dranor then quit again then played bfa
[4:59:06] zysmos: 9.2 saved shadowlands tbf would have probably the worst expansion without it
[4:59:06] honkblarg: thats when i started watching you was during firelands
[4:59:09] fatherfrag: Man I had to heal a Prot warrior in a +16 2 days ago and it was rough. Prot warrions take soo much damage

[5:00:35] Lasidor: Cox and Crendor, SUPER underrated little RP thing they did with Crimnox and Sproodle
[5:00:37] hierophants: cata didn't really have its own 'zone' right? maybe that's why it didn't feel as memorable

[5:18:13] smashwow: toddlers be rough
[5:18:21] R2RHIN0: How about Zul'jin?
[5:18:40] pushnoir: its an achievement to just kill all bosses this tier

[5:19:06] Kinghorn: I feel that
[5:19:13] lithium364: some servers not even 1 parse for heroic jailer LUL
[5:19:30] Sneekzx: I feel like that's most guilds tho
[5:19:32] Wcvechten: man, the upcoming nerfs are hysterical though
[5:19:34] pushnoir: every guild had those nights on jailer
[5:19:38] MrBlackDragon7: @Towelliee What originally got you into tanking?
[5:19:40] manmower: WoW raids are getting crazy complex
[5:19:44] Verdell263: But internal testing....
[5:19:52] lynixxis: @Towelliee I haven't bee around for ages. Did you like the tier?
[5:20:01] Cafe0le: raids should have max 8 bosses and little to no trash imo
[5:20:25] CardinalTX: I wouldnt mind some minimal trash boss fight in wow as in FF
[5:20:30] Yupmoh: better than tank and spank
[5:20:37] pushnoir: sofo best raid since NH mythic
[5:20:40] Scnozzberry: I liked castle and Sod but i dont like sofo
[5:20:44] Nachozdood: @Cafe0le Blizz did that with TOC and everyone hated it
[5:20:59] lynixxis: I'll take sofo over sod any day.
[5:21:02] Kinghorn: he is near glimmering pillar
[5:21:03] zuna1904: toc was hated because it was 1 room.
[5:21:06] Kinghorn: iirc
[5:21:11] zuna1904: and not because there wasnt trash :D
[5:21:12] zysmos: SOFO and CN theme were amazing as well Sanctum was just trash
[5:21:13] swervity82: Lol there is a guild on Stormrage called "Keenan and Kel Thuzad"

[5:21:53] lynixxis: Sanctum was Painsmith and Sylvanas... Sofo at least had like 5 good bosses.

[5:22:32] Sneekzx: @Kinghorn The best feeling haha
[5:22:47] Nachozdood: i was thinking back on wrath the other day and forgot how many raids this Xpac had
[5:22:53] zuna1904: sanctum was undertuned or we were too strong.
[5:23:09] R2RHIN0: Looks like that community link expired. When I enter the code in game, nothing happens.
[5:23:16] manmower: these 11 boss raids are too long for average raiders
[5:23:23] Gingerprimer: @zuna1904 mostly undertuned
[5:23:26] Kinghorn: bless wowhead

[5:34:29] sh4d0wsky: Shadowlands was merely a setback!
[5:34:34] Masqerader: knowing blizzard they will Kael his ass to a dungeon and Castle Nathira was just a setback
[5:34:39] Iynxx: Sire was a much better final boss than the jailer which is sad
[5:34:40] xMortal_Wombatx: Is leveling easier with wotlk? so no more 1 mob -> needing to fully recover like you just fought for your life? :O
[5:34:47] Kriven: what about that holy one on the alliance
[5:34:59] manmower: would have been a better story if Denathrius was playing the Jailer

[5:51:14] LordMorrowbringer: @Towelliee As much as classic or TBC wasnt my big jam, I'm really excited to go back into Wotlk and do some raiding. You think it will be taugh to find a guild?

[5:52:00] Nachozdood: @LordMorrowbringer finding guilds wont be hard if you are on a solid server finding a guild that fits what you want will be the hard part
[5:52:21] hyboric: vendor stuff before ?
[5:52:25] jpwatchesthings: Ah so they will have fresh WOTLK servers? nice

[5:53:04] tsali_: how much gold did that character start with? 500?
[5:53:07] SonofHorus82: most of the posts I see are for both.

[5:53:46] Malicone: Fusionxw pepperoni pizza pineapple on pizza is just no no.
[5:53:50] Murlock07: Truuu
[5:53:57] Nachozdood: @LordMorrowbringer keep your eyes on warrior they could catch some minor nerfs or buffs that might make or break them
[5:54:13] abracka_: i'm way more hype for DF than wrath. it'll just be nice to have wrath as casual content on the side when we're in "lulls" in DF
[5:54:20] manmower: bait players in with return to Wrath and then hook them up to DF
[5:54:25] sampai_gg: Any speculation on when WotLK classic will be released?
[5:54:25] LordMorrowbringer: Pally is always an option @Nachozdood a dwarf with big hammer of elf with longsword
[5:54:37] tsali_: im just trying to figure out how much gold we get from questing

[5:55:27] Woitanski: Depends on whether u need stuff, but should be around 3-5k
[5:55:33] BrutalHermit: BabyRage
[5:55:33] LordMorrowbringer: Any1 knows if level boosts will be aviliable day one to Wotlk classic?
[5:55:34] PotbellyGoat: Blizzard is all: Don't you have friends?
[5:55:35] Nachozdood: cant wait to see everyone saying LF Tank but when a warrior says ill go they say Nah
[5:55:36] doomkry: yeah guys rdf is what killed the social aspect in wow not ppl themselves Kappa
[5:55:41] EasyPeasley: oh absolutely
[5:55:42] Volatilestyle: so right

[5:56:26] Kahnuvair: I aint got time for friends man, let me get my dungeon done and go lmao.

[5:57:02] happybooger: You think you dont want LFD, but you really do
[5:57:10] Cranghoul: DAMN
[5:57:10] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee I use LFD more for leveling alts honestly

[5:57:41] danielthegathering: so its boring
[5:57:41] PvtHudson093: Emotional Damage
[5:57:42] dewking93: will there be guilds that dont do that?
[5:57:43] Cranghoul: @almostdps or its a way to gear up alts outside of main raids in guild :P
[5:57:45] BlewGamingGroup: the problem with that is that most people that quit playing classic because LFD isnt in the game .. will already be on private servers and will tell blizzard to eat a bag of dicks
[5:57:47] Lasidor: I had friends once, DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Solo Lyfe
[5:57:51] Glisur85: How many people dont realize this is their last morning with 10 fingers

[5:58:47] wetttnine: I‚Äôm still in my guild from classic release
[5:58:51] bgod2500: it became a lot swipe to win unfortunately
[5:58:51] Nachozdood: part of what killed some of the feeling of old guild community's was free voice chats everyone has a discord anymore you dont need that paid ventrillo channel to hang out in anymore

[5:59:19] danielthegathering: Rogue with mana jeah
[5:59:24] Masteve: @Towelliee At what point does classic become retial, is that not the dungeonfinder mind set?
[5:59:25] emznev: KEKW
[5:59:28] abracka_: honestly just wish they would introduce the wow token to classic at this point
[5:59:30] EasyPeasley: that poor warlock lol
[5:59:30] jpwatchesthings: the timing of that was perfect
[5:59:32] readyvic: there forgetting wrath was loved for being casual
[5:59:33] Woitanski: @trademarkv2 as Long as ppl pay for it my dude
[5:59:35] emznev: help him towel LUL LUL LUL
[5:59:53] BericTV: I‚Äôve been saying that Wrath is the perfect combo of the Classic vibe and the quality of like things Retail offers.
[5:59:53] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:00:06] doomkry: at least the premade group finder will help for elite quests in the zones
[6:00:14] TheeGoldenHour: @Woitanski at some point it wont be classic anymore
[6:00:18] doomkry: plus finding ppl for raiding
[6:00:19] cosmin284: right

[6:01:00] jamarky23: "challenges"
[6:01:08] bgod2500: alot of people are into tbc/ wrath cause of better pvp systems, tier set bonuses and a greater range of stats for your characters.... dragonflight seems to be fixing that with retail, if blizzard does it right I think retail over takes wrath
[6:01:12] readyvic: amen but it concerns me there not listening about this
[6:01:18] clambynature: Please make sure blizzard understands that
[6:01:18] Farfic: what are your thoughts on no race changes
[6:01:24] Metket: let them struggle finding ppl after 1 month KEKW
[6:01:25] Blury_RNG: have you tried warmane wotlk seasonal realms where they have made dungeons and raids harder each season?
[6:01:26] Woitanski: @trademarkv2 most of ppl declare cata the end of classic. I would guess that they will continue the road of re-releasing wow, but with more changes starting from cata. I guess you can stop calling it classic then, but really the name does not matter imo
[6:01:33] Blury_RNG: and what do you think about it
[6:01:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they need to get alpha hot soon
[6:01:42] jippero3: You think that DF will launch this year?

[6:01:58] hailstormz: true
[6:02:07] doomkry: there are some wotlk privates server that implemented some sort of mythic+ systems so that would be a nice feature to implement
[6:02:08] Cafe0le: you already said you dont care about wrath, why should they listen to you here, no lfd seems like a great change. Premade group finder is all the game needs imo
[6:02:15] clambynature: @Towelliee Yes dude
[6:02:32] Punk611: I quit playing tbc because I forgot how bad it was trying to find a group. and I'm not downloading an app for that.
[6:02:41] Xehanort1986: Oculus LUL

[6:03:34] jamarky23: I seriously need dragonflight soon, fuk all to do on retail and tbc is starting get boring for 2022 gameplay
[6:03:35] doomkry: ppl say that the premade group finder will be enought untill you wait for 1h to go for a dung then start crying in dalaran general chat asking for ppl to queue up
[6:03:46] Cafe0le: LUL
[6:03:48] manmower: we call those people Randy
[6:03:50] wreckshoptv: any idea on wrath launching tow?
[6:03:56] jippero3: shift click
[6:03:59] sh4d0wsky: shift+click
[6:04:21] hailstormz: i think wrath was 1st xpac alot of people got max level, cause it doesnt take a month
[6:04:22] kokochris: yup thats DOA
[6:04:22] Austei: "decline decline declined"
[6:04:24] almostdps: need uld 25 hardmode gear for the daily heroic
[6:04:31] jamarky23: They already are like that on tbc classic
[6:04:34] Cafe0le: just like on retail you can make your own group, it actually works
[6:04:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah and the gear score that people will ask for is going to be way higher than what is necessary
[6:04:53] Baltickat: just make them yourself thats what i do in retail
[6:04:58] growent: it will be exactly as looking for a M+ now....
[6:05:03] Metket: make you own group and suffer the consequences KEKW
[6:05:06] doomkry: the same ppl talking about not wanting rdf will be the first to cry on wowhead about blizz fucking up classic wrath
[6:05:12] hailstormz: no orcs allowed
[6:05:13] Nachozdood: easy fix to long waits for dungeons....try tanking or healing its not hard
[6:05:15] bgod2500: for those who thing that LFG not being in wrath is a bad thing, you never played OG wrath. The daily grind is going to be a pain in the ass without it and with peoples current classicandy elitism mindset
[6:05:19] Baltickat: lich king content is so easy i doubt ppl will be that strict
[6:05:25] smiley7878: wtf 13 ads
[6:05:34] Baltickat: but shaman is a must if you wanna do 10 dngs for marks in 2 hours
[6:05:37] eNeruFPS: @smiley7878 so what
[6:05:40] Baltickat: so yea
[6:05:40] Aidler: @Cafe0le true... but that's not the reality we live in. in reality most people just want to joyn groups
[6:05:42] mintcookie_vajankle: @smiley7878 rekt
[6:06:11] hailstormz: i used to spam UK for levels its so quick lol
[6:06:12] wreckshoptv: coulda completed 6 then :p
[6:06:15] Austei: healing and tanked for bc classic  and was  a shit show trying get groups. was painful
[6:06:33] TheeGoldenHour: rogue or mage for pvp guys?
[6:06:34] wrec7: I agree
[6:06:37] Korupcija_: when wrath came did you spam dungeons or quest
[6:06:45] TheeGoldenHour: fire mage?
[6:06:46] Nachozdood: @trademarkv2 Mage
[6:07:02] hailstormz: WOTLK is def more casual friendly
[6:07:07] Nachozdood: fire mage for pvp is a meme
[6:07:13] Baltickat: BECAUSE CLASSIC ANDYS WILL CRY i just hope the still keep the daily rewards from rdf hc in some form
[6:07:15] TheeGoldenHour: @Nachozdood fire ?frost?
[6:07:29] Korupcija_: ahh ye there was no group finder at start
[6:07:29] Nachozdood: frost if you really want to do well in pvp
[6:07:32] Korupcija_: forgot
[6:07:44] doomkry: i hope the classic andies dont cry about the daily hc quests
[6:07:52] Baltickat: and in rdf hc you get 2 emblems at the end of the dng so how are they gonna fix that
[6:08:04] Baltickat: like every dng
[6:08:12] HecticSpaniard: they should allow random queues for normal/heroic raids, see who uses it LUL

[6:08:17] Nachozdood: @Baltickat easy fix just add them to end boss
[6:08:35] OssewTV: even if RDF was in the game most people in the first few weeks wont have the gearscore to be able to que up for heroics anyway.
[6:08:35] Nachozdood: @Stopnsmellmynutz was a cata thing
[6:08:43] Baltickat: @Nachozdood idk if they will do that blizzard are kinda out of touch with us
[6:08:56] wazza76: Has Beta been very buggy or not too bad?
[6:09:14] zenFX_: @Nachozdood late cata aswell i believe
[6:09:16] amkttv: 187-200 blues is pre-raid, iirc
[6:09:23] robotninja20: robotninja20 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:09:44] doomkry: @AntiVirus93 wrong, with rdf you would be able to spam dung even faster to grind rep with tabard
[6:09:45] Timothious: is it just quests that seem buggged?
[6:09:56] Baltickat: rdf hc can be reached in 3 days of at most 8 hours of rep and dng farming at 80 halls of lightning farm when you get the tabard for every faction

[6:11:06] Malicone: just go to your battle and check it. ^^
[6:11:06] wreckshoptv: the new fel reaver
[6:11:13] Frank4LuLz: reaver 2.0
[6:11:40] eckylis: AFAIK the only questline removed from Wrath in Retail was the battle for Undercity
[6:12:04] Einzbern: Didn't they make elites into non elites as well? Or was that just for cata stuff?
[6:12:15] eckylis: @Einzbern Yep, this too
[6:12:21] Ziephier: nice the mounts in the wow shop are on sale for 1/2 price
[6:12:24] Baltickat: @Einzbern yes
[6:12:24] zenFX_: @Einzbern wrath
[6:12:25] solsaver12: Ya I never played Wrath back in the day...started wehn Cata came out.
[6:13:00] Baltickat: test it out no balls
[6:13:00] portend: Only thing that's missing is the pre-order pick up experience
[6:13:06] Jpreme4: im apprehensive bc i know it wont be the same experience it was back then, everyones going to meta game it and minmax
[6:13:10] Nachozdood: cant wait for Laggy dalaran!!! Mankrik population all in 1 small city
[6:13:16] solsaver12: Awesome
[6:13:30] moneymcduck: wrath, the last good expansion for me
[6:13:48] almostdps: 10 man exists in everything but mythic though
[6:13:53] manmower: 10man heroic
[6:13:58] Korupcija_: so dumb it's not a thing
[6:14:03] swags67: Quit after BC came back at legion so this is all new to me. Looking forward to it
[6:14:08] TamerLoli: 10 Man Mythic Pog
[6:14:11] Xerati404: 10m heroic still worse gear than 25 normal
[6:14:21] svu3: i think its hard to tune for 10m
[6:14:25] svu3: maybe 15?
[6:14:26] hailstormz: all on diff lockouts too right?
[6:14:27] TamerLoli: Spoiler DF has 10 man mythic :)
[6:14:37] Punk611: when people don't realize 10 man SoFO is harder than 15+ people.
[6:14:39] EllisTheMenace1: no lfd is keeping me from playing wrath
[6:14:39] robotninja20: Im just nostalgia tripping with this atm myself, as i started in LK
[6:14:43] NieIas: LUL
[6:14:46] solsaver12: Whats best class to play in Wrath? I have a lvl 70 hunter atm.
[6:14:46] gundamzeros01: Icc 10 Heroic title are epic *Bane of the Fallen King *
[6:14:58] Moobot: üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[6:15:20] Punk611: there are just too many fights that require bodies and if you lose 1 person it becomes significantly harder.

[6:18:20] zenFX_: @Timothious Dk's were insanely op for certain things. Soloing raid bosses for one once you have icc gear

[6:31:29] CritcobainTV: @elbinn Assassination becomes viable, hunger for blood is insane and tricks of the trade now is a damage boost
[6:31:54] Timothious: you have to do your research to do good
[6:31:57] Evcon_: @elbinn glaives arent required
[6:32:05] solsaver12: Good video
[6:32:08] CritcobainTV: a lot of the time rogues will use tricks of the trade on each other after the first one
[6:32:16] Snirs: I played Boomkin in ICC and i remember doing pretty good..
[6:32:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: The data is great, as far as ranking  them
[6:32:37] stallowned: oh ya i forgot about tricks trading in wrath
[6:32:42] Molvonos: I was Feral for Naxx/Ulduar and it was a John Fucking Madden spreadsheet.
[6:32:57] solsaver12: lol
[6:32:57] Korupcija_: wtf why
[6:32:59] tebbix: Warrior Sadge
[6:32:59] Kisswani: KEKW damn
[6:33:02] CrunkyBrewster: LULW
[6:33:05] CrunkyBrewster: dude\
[6:33:05] stallowned: poor warriors KEKW
[6:33:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: That looks like an accurate tier list (RIP prot warrior)
[6:33:07] wreckshoptv: damn
[6:33:07] CritcobainTV: D = Dont bring KEKW
[6:33:09] jpwatchesthings: harsh tokes
[6:33:09] Nevindaz: KEKW
[6:33:10] Nachozdood: the dude in the middle HATES warriors
[6:33:14] CrunkyBrewster: that aint right yo
[6:33:16] BlewGamingGroup: truth hurts
[6:33:16] sshadeh: LUL
[6:33:18] Xeeshki: its Dont bring for "D"
[6:33:21] zenFX_: thats bollocks. Warrior was good for tanking everything but ulduar
[6:33:25] manmower: same as Shadowlands
[6:33:25] BoostedLooped: arent warriors bis tanks in cata
[6:33:27] elbinn: warriors in shamblesw
[6:33:28] Xeeshki: A B C D"ont bringt"
[6:33:30] conv3rge_: That's rough
[6:33:33] LeBigNose: chats used to it :O
[6:33:38] Timothious: our raid leader was a warrior and he tanked for us
[6:33:42] CritcobainTV: i think warrior is fine, not for speed running though
[6:33:47] Eviltuna13: I played restro druid in Wrath. they where kings
[6:33:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot warriors were still very strong against physical damage, just weak against against magic damage
[6:33:54] solsaver12: Wrath will be a great filler before Dragonflight.
[6:33:55] Kisswani: danKEK
[6:34:02] Jay_rb: Warriors are the best dps tank tho KEKW
[6:34:06] Failer91: danKEK
[6:34:06] Jay_rb: so they will be brought for speedruns
[6:34:10] mintcookie_vajankle: Prot Paladin is only considered #1 because of Ardent Defender. They're really good prog tanks, but BDK pulls ahead for defense and Druids later on do substantially more damage than anything else.
[6:34:15] richardroot: argent defender, was the talanet that made pallies the most favored tank at the trial of the crusader patch
[6:34:16] cobwebhotdog: Our main tank in tbc is a prot warrior, its rough being so threat limited instead of having another feral
[6:34:17] CrunkyBrewster: LULW
[6:34:19] Nachozdood: Warrior can do it all fine they just arnt the best at what they do so everyone blows it out of proportion
[6:34:21] Nico_vdM: My pally in Wrath was specced into crusade in ret tree and that was a fun build
[6:34:27] Verdell263: Fs in chat for Warriors?
[6:34:29] Lasidor: Hpal and Disc were kinds of Wrath, if you beat those in your raid, they were shit healers.  ABSURDLY powerful healing.
[6:34:29] Nachozdood: same dude from the 1st vid
[6:34:34] HawtPepperTuna: not enough alphabets for them
[6:34:39] BlewGamingGroup: wrath is literally grab a prot pally and a then a dk or drood with a semi decent set of off gear
[6:34:46] bittygroom: pre patch WOTLK dw frost tanking was the best tanking class ever
[6:34:54] Brickneim: for bench
[6:34:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is possible for prot warrior to complete pretty much all the content, they will just need a lot more healing in some situations
[6:34:55] dirtylurker69: B for bad?
[6:34:56] Austei: sus lol
[6:34:56] StalkerOnTwitch: WHy are warriors bad as tank in wotlk? bad aoe?
[6:34:58] Xeeshki: B for BEST?
[6:34:58] richardroot: seeing early dk tanks will be real interesting
[6:34:58] manmower: B for belongs in the trash
[6:35:07] Nico_vdM: B? A war main methinks
[6:35:07] BlewGamingGroup: that dude probably plays a prot warrior
[6:35:10] Kisswani: Prot warriors ranked as : " might as well solo tank with another class "
[6:35:23] Korupcija_: what about dungeon tanking
[6:35:24] bawheid: wasnt frost dk the dk tank spec in wotlk?
[6:35:29] mekatok: warrior in wraith is the bottom bitch
[6:35:33] Nachozdood: @StalkerOnTwitch they arnt bad they do everything well the others just do stuff better
[6:35:42] Lasidor: Icy Touch DK was the DK tank, spec didnt matter lol
[6:35:46] zenFX_: @StalkerOnTwitch they arent bad they just get outshined by pala and dk, mainly in ulduar
[6:35:52] doomkry: classic in shambles NotLikeThis
[6:35:59] CritcobainTV: Warriors are doing pretty well in dungeons, i was watching Zirene on the beta killing it
[6:36:04] Korupcija_: because I want to tank in dungeons, dps in raids KEKW
[6:36:06] CritcobainTV: full SWP gear tho
[6:36:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Paladin is easy mode tanking and most people will always want one of them, I'm sticking with blood DK  tho
[6:36:25] richardroot: when did pallies get holypower in wraith was it icc?
[6:36:27] Nachozdood: Look for the revenge spec tank i claps

[6:37:26] Nico_vdM: Barney: Suit up!
[6:37:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear tank has to make their health pool as large as possible to absorb everything, but they can do alright
[6:37:41] Exxcar: Wrath was just the pally expac
[6:38:00] readyvic: bear was the tank for world first lich king
[6:38:15] bawheid: @weirdo_dude wasn't frost the dk tanking spec in wotlk
[6:38:25] lithium364: unnerfed dks are still gonna destroy the first season in wrath, i remember winning 3vs1 LUL
[6:38:27] eckylis: Are you listening to D2 music in the background?
[6:38:27] Nico_vdM: I wonder when ICC drop will they bring back the 30% hp boost
[6:38:31] Timothious: is this info from private servers that worked out the perfect specs for all classes over the years?
[6:39:10] sprert: exorzism works better with undeads and undeads are everwhere... who could have thought that paladins would feel at home in wrath Kappa

[6:39:35] user11214: like cata?
[6:39:39] Nachozdood: you gotta look at tanks like the grading system Pally and DKs have an A+ druids an A and warriors an A- its still an A but its the lowest so warmain peeps meme on it hard
[6:39:55] cptrogers123: Europa life
[6:39:56] PracTlKaL: I think wotlk is the perfect time to go another direction with classic
[6:40:29] daweda45: how long it took u to reach this many bars of 79
[6:40:30] Nachozdood: not Anubarak from what i remember
[6:40:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, and paladins are easier to play....less chance of error
[6:40:43] cptrogers123: When you do high keys with prot pally in SL, it feels like you are made of paper
[6:41:06] richardroot: argent defender to oops talent was super op, dk anti magic
[6:41:25] Exxcar: I wish we were gonna get tri-spec DK techSad
[6:41:39] richardroot: it was at the trial of the crusader i think
[6:42:06] richardroot: thats when they inroduced flip a switch hard mode
[6:42:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you are dead set at being a frost or unholy tank, you can probably do alright, it's just going to be a bit harder
[6:42:22] Timothious: I had always played hunter and tried tanking with a pally. Didn't have any keys set up to walk backwards and failed pretty bad lol
[6:43:41] Nachozdood: @Timothious dont need the back peddle key just have to stafe and keep your camra facing the mobs if i recall
[6:43:41] Exxcar: Blood was a DPS spec wasn't it? I thought frost started as the tank spec?
[6:43:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: It seems like that unholy gargoyle might be a bit wonky right now
[6:44:00] Timothious: was the prison in dalaran
[6:44:04] richardroot: the damage a pally tank could dish out in icc was crazy
[6:44:05] readyvic: yes frost is the tanking spec in wrath
[6:44:18] readyvic: it switched in cata
[6:44:25] Timothious: one of the mobs required you to back away
[6:44:31] Lasidor: DK tank= press Icy Touch
[6:44:58] KombatWombat07: all 3 specs can tank in wotlk

[6:49:08] bovlove: can you break down each zone by level pls?
[6:49:13] KombatWombat07: for sure, i think Unh was just a dungeon cleave tank type
[6:49:24] BlewGamingGroup: yea ... a DK on beta right now will literally kill almost any mob before you can even get to death coil
[6:49:25] tsali_: and sit in frost pres

[6:52:16] sorli_: I'm deciding if i come back based on how they respond to player feedback from alpha/beta
[6:52:26] madvaca: ya then it died fast
[6:52:27] Jarless: WoD was better than SL
[6:52:32] Narovoid: Patch 9.0 for me was my favorite. CN was a really good raid
[6:52:33] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on wrath classic and DF, immortal do you think they are trying to cut the pie to much?
[6:52:36] TacDuc: Yeah, SL was Blizzards most sold thing
[6:52:45] Rudric_Ice: BFA was better than SL
[6:52:47] chrslp: If you're questioning if you're coming back to WoW, you're already coming back KEKW
[6:52:49] Sttarrkz: SL was literally crap

[6:53:17] Vendralos: @novlen 77
[6:53:18] Angxlic: shadowlands had a lot of amazing QoL additions but the expansion sucked more tha BFA
[6:53:20] novlen: Awesome.
[6:53:44] TacDuc: It even beat all of their game sales
[6:53:50] Narovoid: I leveled 1-50 in BFA and wish I played bfa leveling 110-120

[6:54:14] Hellizzy: that is 100% true
[6:54:33] Narovoid: When I read your tweet about how you liked the farming for AP and Azerite. I wished I played BFA and Legion for that too.
[6:54:34] Killa1413: I love how Evoker is feeling more and more like a Spellslinger from Wildstar.
[6:54:35] NieIas: first month is fun, they realize its same old and unsub till prepatch of next expac LUL
[6:54:39] TacDuc: @TombStoneMercenary I wouldn't say there ever was a content drought, it just wasn't fun content, because we had so much to do
[6:54:51] sorli_: They will be there for d4 too mark my words
[6:55:00] abracka_: "i'll just login for 5 minutes and see what the hype is about"
[6:55:09] manmower: once the WoW BR pvp comes out, numbers are gonna explode
[6:55:13] MasterNeff: Whether the expansions end up trash or not, every expansion is fun for the first few weeks.
[6:55:15] figsaregood: I don't hate wow but I'm sceptical, will wait for the first sale this time to see the expansion
[6:55:19] TombStoneMercenary: @TacDuc good point
[6:55:23] chrslp: The only reason I like new expansions is because it gives me a chance to not be super behind everyone LUL I usually fall behind anyway though
[6:55:37] Mashiiro98: @TombStoneMercenary 8 months to get 9.1 was kind of a bad drought
[6:55:41] Rudric_Ice: @Narovoid  u lucky that u didn't grind for AP power cuz after time it gets old and boring
[6:55:47] arieuh: its not

[6:56:09] LoneRangers: Bias aside what do you think is going to be the class to play in dragon?
[6:56:16] flebbooo: Mop is turning 10 years in 2 months NotLikeThis
[6:56:20] pazta9: yea but the tree is super boring its like nothing differentt from what we have now
[6:56:25] gitcrit: almost 80 my dude

[6:56:34] Molvonos: @pazta9 ????
[6:56:35] sorli_: Still just going to look up what the best players are doing so i dont have to theory craft LULW
[6:56:38] Putcride: @Towelliee that last rehaul was 2012 so its about 10years from mop and 11 from cata

[6:56:49] Mashiiro98: and i love that about the trees, that's dope
[6:56:55] TamerLoli: i hope hunter gets surv ranged spec again Kreygasm
[6:56:56] heavenphist: But I have one concern, why are we not getting new spells? Just because they bring talent trees back and put existing spells on it (which is good) shouldn't mean no new spells right?
[6:57:02] chrslp: The new talents are gonna slow down world first race I bet. Theyre gonna need more time to find those minmax builds
[6:57:04] feherlofia123: priest talent tree calculator for dragonflight looks very promising
[6:57:06] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee are talent swapping on demand or is there a CD?
[6:57:09] manmower: yea POE showed people like options
[6:57:09] heavenphist: Or maybe early to say and we will get spells
[6:57:11] TacDuc: I love having the ability to min-max, I don't even care if my build is good, I'm just going to do it
[6:57:17] Hellizzy: Is it not already heavy build oriented? With all the different Covs and bs that comes with it? It'll just be baked into your character now
[6:57:24] lithium364: dragonflight the year of the spear
[6:57:26] Nachozdood: @heavenphist it has a few old and newer spells
[6:57:30] Buckwink: the shadow priest 6 pets build looks cool

[6:58:36] Buckwink: DF about to be a banger dont at me
[6:58:46] manmower: is PVP gonna become build counterplay?
[6:58:46] bawheid: does it result in every spec for every class has the same abilities to ensure every class/spec has a build for every scenario?
[6:58:47] Rudric_Ice: im only using what i think its good :)

[6:58:58] Hood______: @Shazlen ret is so good in wrath
[6:59:01] Slaanesh74: I think in a talent tree, BP is a good thing
[6:59:11] Shatraugh: everyones gonna play ret or warr lol
[6:59:17] chrslp: Feral DPS finally becomes a viable class in Wrath, right?
[6:59:23] Lasidor: Wanna be a get Ret paladin in Wrath, get CLCRet and boom you are a pro
[6:59:24] scenario17: every class has a good spec in wrath
[6:59:24] Molvonos: @chrslp Yep
[6:59:28] TacDuc: @Lasidor Oi, DK should have itg

[6:59:49] Lasidor: @Rudric_Ice Absolutely...
[6:59:51] Einzbern: john fucking madden
[7:00:04] ozpalo: cat swipe in wrath is crazy dps
[7:00:06] Nachozdood: Feral the number one class beging for Hysteria from DKs
[7:00:07] palastiel: will we have a new Catalyst for DF ?
[7:00:16] Molvonos: @chrslp It's good in wrath, less rotation and more about maintaining buffs/debuffs for optimal dps.
[7:00:16] Genilort: insta heals and clones
[7:00:23] TombStoneMercenary: @chrslp yup lvl 25 right now and cant get into a run to save my life as feral
[7:00:23] SpicyFeta: Are there Reputation requirements for dungeons or raids? is the grind big on this expansion ?
[7:00:26] gholdan: did you grind from 70-80 or did it start you closer to 80?
[7:00:26] Lasidor: Their AoE Bleed if I remember was very dumb in wrath
[7:00:38] cptrogers123: The people i have met who play feral, are actually reallly good at their class
[7:00:39] belaham: Hysteria was freaking amazing
[7:00:43] Nachozdood: and Focus magic from mages
[7:00:49] Molvonos: PI for Locks, Hysteria for Rogues.
[7:00:50] Sherbert1492: so excited for wotlk gotta level a character though oof
[7:00:51] chrslp: My feral druid is still in the gear from when Hammer Squad guild broke up LUL Like half leveling gear and half kara gear

[7:00:51] Quazzie8: armor pen/swipe/berserk
[7:00:54] belaham: Its built back into the new talent tree's but its only castable on the DK now I think
[7:00:58] readyvic: savage roar and swipe changes is what made the difference however feral requires a high skill cap peeps are forgetting that
[7:01:01] lithium364: i loved hysteria i always gave it to my fury friend in raid
[7:01:05] Rudric_Ice: they should've put it in DK tress
[7:01:13] Sherbert1492: Sherbert1492 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[7:01:15] Exxcar: Wrath was the days of the John Madden feral druid
[7:01:24] Skrynor: Skrynor subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[7:01:38] Quazzie8: Mjolner Runestune+Deathbringer's Will
[7:01:41] Skrynor: ooh! feral druid with a ton of armor penetration..those were the days in wrath
[7:02:02] Lasidor: Armor Pen was super OP
[7:02:04] Sherbert1492: <3
[7:02:09] silodin: I am looking forward to pvp for the first time in a few expansions.
[7:02:11] chrslp: Oh btw I was hearing that on the fresh servers for Wrath you'll need a 55+ on that server to make a DK rather than based on a 55+ on your whole account?
[7:02:23] Nachozdood: @Skrynor O.o what was armor pen helping on a cat? shred and thats it?
[7:02:23] mintcookie_vajankle: Feral didnt need Armor Pen though cuz bleed ignores already so they could stack main stat
[7:02:26] Exxcar: @chrslp Correct
[7:02:33] chrslp: FeelsBadMan
[7:02:44] Molvonos: Wrath Feral Flowchart: https://i.imgur.com/QhoAt0x.jpg
[7:02:44] Timothious: way it should be
[7:02:53] chrslp: Seems weird to restrict DK's on an expac that highlights them LUL
[7:02:59] Dman2008: @chrslp if it wasent that way there would be no need to even haev the fresh server as every1 would start at 55 instead of 1

[7:03:33] Sherbert1492: yall think blizz have a wotlk classic character boost ?
[7:03:34] twistedstick1: Being a good dog dad.
[7:03:37] HeatherJC83: @Towelliee give us the insider news.. is alpha this week? lol
[7:03:39] chrslp: @Dman2008 That just brings up the question- are many people really going to want to start from complete scratch and have to wait a while to make a DK?
[7:03:44] gitcrit: oef yeah, probably no fun time for dogs
[7:03:53] chrslp: Rather than just stay on their current server and continue progressing
[7:04:10] Exxcar: @Sherbert1492 They've already said their will be a boost because that's one of the restrictions on the fresh servers that you can't use the boost on them
[7:04:13] Dman2008: @chrslp ppl did it on pservers, jsut 1-55, then 55-80 as dk, its not that big of a deal really.  i personally dont want to start from scratch and wont be on the freshs erver tho
[7:04:17] Quazzie8: At the end of Ulduar and into ICC Armor pen pulled way ahead and got nerfed iirc
[7:04:21] TombStoneMercenary: For wrath do you think they will keep the current model of classic for phase's or do you see them slowing things down?
[7:04:24] chrslp: My dog has a very very helpful Trazodone prescription for the fireworks
[7:04:29] Sherbert1492: @Exxcar sweet thanks man
[7:04:30] hansenmann: Hi all, hi @towelliee can you Show me your spec right? Looks like Fun LUL
[7:04:32] Arocian: its great
[7:04:34] CardinalTX: I got beef and chicken fajitas coming off the grill.....jalapeno sausage as well
[7:04:40] jeflag: @chrslp isnt that the whole point of new server though? starting fresh? if every1 starts as dk at lvl55 then ppl that starts at lvl1 will feel lose out
[7:04:41] gitcrit: no spoilers!
[7:04:42] pladlad: i just started it last night, i really like it
[7:04:45] Buckwink: chris pratt in serious roles KEKW
[7:04:47] labrhat: Strange New World
[7:04:48] lynixxis: @Towelliee YO! This season of The Boys has been FUCKING great.
[7:04:49] Cafe0le: stranger worlds
[7:04:51] abracka_: that's not chris pratt in that show, that's bert maclin, FBI
[7:04:56] chrslp: @Dman2008 But if people do that, then it'll just be a server full of DKs and no one will be raiding till people catch back up or transfers unlock

[7:05:39] Dman2008: @chrslp not every1 wants to play dk
[7:05:41] thepaladinjournal: kenobi was hella good for the second half
[7:05:52] abracka_: that one vader scene and the ship made me "OH SHIT!"
[7:05:56] sorli_: The last episode was decent
[7:06:04] labrhat: @sorli_ oof
[7:06:07] chrslp: @Dman2008 Yeah not everyone but it will be disproportionate for sure
[7:06:11] manmower: when he chops the star destroyer in half...
[7:06:17] TacDuc: It was alright, didn't like how that lightsabers are super weak, with them always cutting through almost anything they touch
[7:06:18] readyvic: there will be peeps raiding week 2 on fresh servers people underestimate the try hards
[7:06:20] WheyandTren: almost 80 damn
[7:06:28] Dman2008: @chrslp i dont think it will be as bad as u think, ppl moistly know what class they want to play id think and its not all dks
[7:06:44] TombStoneMercenary: Kenobi was great but they stretched that story out way to much could of been done in like 3 episodes
[7:06:55] chrslp: I guess I'm just going off my original Wrath experience when servers were absolutely FLOODED with DKs LUL
[7:07:04] hansenmann: @towelliee  can you Show me your spec pls? Looks like fun
[7:07:09] filipebar: hey hey

[7:07:33] TweakT: is Wrath a bad geim?
[7:07:35] TombStoneMercenary: @AlphaToaster its a bug
[7:07:35] Dman2008: @chrslp that wasnt my experience in original wrath, but ppl know it more now than abck then so should be even less
