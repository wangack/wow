[0:09:08] primejusticegaming: @Xeliumimar I think only bubble/bop and spell bop should give forbear

[0:09:14] primejusticegaming: LOH giving forbear is really whack

[0:16:43] ALLtheEXP: sack rogues
[0:16:44] pattarx: hpal just flops low key
[0:16:47] primejusticegaming: Have a major question for you. Nameplates seem to be a serious issue. I had used the advanced interface options suggestions from the Bicmix video. However it seems now it seems that it reset or something. What do you do to monitor nameplates?
[0:17:28] Somanie: @wackpoetic oh my god that's how my cat Biscuit is with his pickles
[0:18:00] wackpoetic: Biscuit is an excellent cat name
[0:18:08] ALLtheEXP: so is Paul
[0:19:23] Cdenzy: peepoTalk

[0:23:19] ArdellanDH: It seems like Gladius has been buggy lately with the display of the addon when not In a arena
[0:23:23] xEejayx: solo shuffles feel bad in general
[0:23:25] chaps_86: Good morning Ven

[0:24:39] chaps_86: I use BetterBlizzPlates
[0:24:46] chaps_86: cool addon
[0:24:46] kralix: Amesing
[0:24:49] heymomimonttv: doesnt make sense to me when someone says "i dont use the addon u use, but i got this addon from another streamer and its not working. what do?"
[0:24:52] ChapAssless: @venruki First time i ever played with you was your dh you randomly jumped into my lfg
[0:24:57] heymomimonttv: not flaming either
[0:25:06] Scottsima: @venruki  you think rets are dogshit for shuffle?
[0:25:30] Merkflare: its bad with holy cause forbearance
[0:25:36] ChapAssless: i think i was rsham. but im dogwater. and a 2k dh applied i said "fuck yeah" like 3 games in a friend was messaging me telling me it was you lol

[0:26:28] 서약님: Good morning beef steak, Sir ven.
[0:26:31] gabbagool: guy betrayed the wave
[0:26:41] Cdenzy: that was such a rogue move
[0:26:51] gabbagool: rogue scum
[0:26:53] kyleuselton: is there any other way to contact bliz about account issues besides tickets
[0:26:54] ALLtheEXP: classic rogue
[0:26:58] nurotv: the hate to rogue
[0:26:59] Merkflare: gutless sewer dweller
[0:26:59] chaps_86: backstabbers
[0:26:59] Cvarks: HeyGuys
[0:27:00] Cdenzy: gonna wave so he thinks im nice and then open KEKW
[0:27:03] Xeliumimar: are u playing phase 2 of sod lol
[0:27:21] Vautry: in a game where you can literally be a dragon, rogue players choose "guy who steals" - think about that
[0:27:23] nurotv: best class in the game. best lore also
[0:27:26] carrvve: how do you do that thing where you queue on two characters? is your mage a totel diff blizz account?
[0:27:29] Cdenzy: leveling to 40 DansGame
[0:27:33] ooPickleRicKoo: SoD sucks dude
[0:27:37] nuddy_plays: as pika says, you're already playing it. Season of Dragonflight
[0:28:01] hulkdieselx: SoD, you mean DoA
[0:28:02] Judgejobrown: i'd honestly rather watch you play m+ keys than SoD
[0:28:06] chaps_86: I just fall asleep playing any form of classic
[0:28:07] kralix: i got to lvl 7 in sod, said id rather arena. went back retail
[0:28:08] ArdellanDH: Are you doing AWC
[0:28:11] hulkdieselx: dead on arrival
[0:28:11] Judgejobrown: if it came to it
[0:28:16] heymomimonttv: pika is a retail player, that's all. sod is boring for his zoomer brain

[0:28:31] Fusion0202: HeyGuys
[0:28:34] dakotan517: kek
[0:28:37] dakotan517: lvl 25 bis
[0:28:38] nurotv: i think your stream is successfull playing retail arena
[0:28:41] heymomimonttv: classic is just rough and as a grown man i dont want to play a game that feels like work
[0:28:50] Cdenzy: you are venruki everyone will want you FeelsStrongMan
[0:28:50] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: youre full bis to me :)
[0:28:52] kreyzy8: It seems like the SoD hype was a lot less than hardcore
[0:28:55] hulkdieselx: seriously, i was very hype for it. hit 25, cleared the raid first week, was way too easy and slow with a 1 button rotation, hung it up
[0:29:12] ImJordanHi: Full BIS in a 15 year old game, poggies!
[0:29:27] Cdenzy: warriors and rogues still top dps KEKW
[0:29:38] dakotan517: as it should be
[0:29:38] ImJordanHi: True they added 10 abilities per class, that already in exist in retail
[0:29:39] Kazooiielol: ackshually!
[0:29:44] kralix: i saw a private server idea that seems way cooler. u just get random abilities as u level
[0:29:45] Vautry: depends on if you define SOD as a game or game mode
[0:29:48] pugulus_prime: Are any of the skills actually new or are they all just old skills?
[0:30:10] kritikos5: @pugulus_prime they have truly new things, yes. mages can heal
[0:30:10] Cdenzy: Where is this in wow
[0:30:16] Cvarks: sp is disgusting
[0:30:22] ArdellanDH: Shadows play ?
[0:30:22] leeka: sp pumpin
[0:30:23] ChapAssless: spriest looks so unkillable rn
[0:30:26] iv9ry: who wouldve guessed
[0:30:26] ImJordanHi: I saw you running it yesterday LUL
[0:30:27] Cvarks: the hp and armor buffs made that shit god mode agane
[0:30:27] FlashZappa: what do you think about ww/destro?
[0:30:32] Dirtydan007: with rdru?
[0:30:40] privx: sp lock is like 50% of games
[0:30:47] chaps_86: New expansions from the classic game-mode would be interesting to me.
[0:30:52] Piktorr: Ty for the drops
[0:30:53] kralix: i saw some ppl were playing blood dk in 3s recently
[0:31:01] murlad: have you healed on mw at all this season? I’ve been really enjoying it
[0:31:02] didgeridoo1001: lilke demo lock or any lock?
[0:31:09] chaps_86: Like a classic alternate time line
[0:31:10] ooPickleRicKoo: outlaw rogue with any caster would kill that comp I feel like
[0:31:17] privx: this meta is super freakin damp
[0:31:24] privx: they need to revert some changes
[0:31:27] Pradathelord: it’s real bad
[0:31:29] leeka: caster vs caster teams take way too long
[0:31:36] Jathela: 2s and 3s feel bad to me right now but shuffle honestly feels nice pacing wise
[0:31:36] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:31:41] Pradathelord: we don’t need all these slowing nerfs at the same time
[0:31:50] Jathela: feels like they did the changes for shuffle specifically
[0:31:57] Dirtydan007: RMD a mega damp now too lol
[0:32:13] Judgejobrown: nvdacalls KEKW
[0:32:24] Pradathelord: we shouldn’t have cc nerf, healer trinket short, stam buff all at once, it is the most boring shit
[0:32:24] chaps_86: I had a ele/destro/rdruid vs ele/aff/rdruid (my team) last night. 56% damp before game ended
[0:32:38] Bombdiggity3315: Am I wrong for thinking that a dampening meta implies that the game is well balanced?
[0:33:17] toddj76: This was my favorite game, like life. And they ruined it just at the end of MoP. I now know they what they did because they knew what a bust WoD would be
[0:33:19] Pradathelord: yes
[0:33:27] ArdellanDH: I feel like this meta is good because it's not the same comps you see everyday. They made it to the point where a lot classes can mesh together instead of the "USUALS". But lately a lot of main heals I've been seeing is a lot of disc and resto druids
[0:33:31] zeni_sar: @Bombdiggity3315 there are many ways to achieve what could be considered balance, long games is one of them but could also create an un-fun meta
[0:33:41] Bombdiggity3315: that's fair
[0:34:30] Pradathelord: long games that can’t end are uninteresting
[0:34:36] nurotv: everyone misses mop but i feel that in mop everyone complained that everyone had everyone ability.
[0:34:39] ooPickleRicKoo: @ArdellanDH resto shaman is doing pretty well, but then you meet a punch monk and you are dead lol
[0:34:55] ArdellanDH: Yeah that is true lol
[0:35:07] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:35:44] nurotv: mop was when rdruid could blink bash clone. op
[0:35:46] soddi: maybe walls should do damage over time the closer you are to them, and it increases with dampening :D
[0:36:20] macdeezyx: outlaw rogue+caster and caster comps...damp
[0:36:30] cyborg1141: Kill the punch monk
[0:37:33] ooPickleRicKoo: he is not punching tho and he really should
[0:37:33] taylorperiod: yooooo
[0:37:50] cyborg1141: For the shamans

[0:38:47] Aro725: You want to try and keep essence break with eyebeam this way you get the empowered deathsweep for the buff. Thats like your 40 second big burst window outside of meta. Then every other you get the Hunt as well.
[0:39:06] Magottx: Goot mornin friend how you enjoying dh
[0:39:12] ArdellanDH: Pressure and just throw your ccs only on healer lol
[0:39:58] soddi: i liked how the game battlerite kept games fast, by slowly reducing the size of the arena
[0:40:13] ArdellanDH: I always eyebeam/essence break non-meta. Then on meta, I eye beam/essence break/hunt
[0:40:14] Magottx: Gucci just got done with a lift.
[0:40:30] Aro725: That was a nice setup right there!
[0:40:49] ALLtheEXP: biiig deathsweep
[0:41:28] Aro725: OooO youre playing cycle of hatred. So that will give eye beam cdr. I gotcha makes it harder to keep them synced
[0:41:34] ALLtheEXP: great sweep
[0:41:36] boundric: this week as been ven story arc of becoming a DH main
[0:41:46] ALLtheEXP: @boundric yes
[0:41:58] Somanie: song?
[0:42:01] Somanie: this shit is hittin
[0:42:13] malvarcla: @Somanie idk
[0:42:29] ALLtheEXP: Palms - Quixotic
[0:43:02] Aro725: EZ Clap
[0:43:14] Somanie: PepoG
[0:43:23] Somanie: yoink
[0:46:16] boundric: dance with the dead by banshee. love this song
[0:46:16] Aro725: LFG
[0:46:21] Aro725: deathsweep OP
[0:46:24] MagickWarlock: fuck ya ven
[0:46:24] ImJordanHi: If a team mate of a disc priest is low, and you're trying to kick something that will lockout the most schools of magic or abilities what's the best? Like flash heal, penance, I know they've got some stuff out of that school though
[0:46:25] ALLtheEXP: god DH is so much fun to play
[0:46:32] yippey_: what is this DH herecy??
[0:46:51] gamblinfoo: is DH fun to play?
[0:46:58] boundric: looks like it
[0:47:09] ALLtheEXP: its the most fun
[0:47:18] ALLtheEXP: I hate how fun it is, I have other toons I wanna play
[0:47:45] boundric: WW is not having a good day
[0:47:46] Cvarks: what place has the best 4 piece
[0:48:01] heymomimonttv: zaxbys
[0:48:02] Cvarks: nuggeys
[0:48:02] ALLtheEXP: Slim Chicken's
[0:48:37] fistweaveurnan: raising canes
[0:49:23] soddi: @ImJordanHi the the disc priest still has life swap, then kicking a shadow spell may be valueable. Otherwise I'd kick penance, as thats the strongest heal afaik
[0:49:30] ALLtheEXP: gimme dat caniac combo, hold the slaw and gimme extra toast
[0:50:51] Merkflare: ah so close
[0:50:57] soddi: your shaman was oom :<
[0:51:09] boundric: no on lost rating in that lobby? that's something you don't see much
[0:51:12] boundric: one*
[0:51:50] magnusz: that awkward time when eye beam isnt up
[0:51:51] slummin36: crazy how dps get 20 points for 3/3 but healers get 0 and get 20 points for 5-1 hahahaha.
[0:51:51] heymomimonttv: i feel like thats just melee rn
[0:51:51] kloudykloudd: I think its cause you main mage brother lol
[0:51:55] magnusz: so ur just existing
[0:51:55] aaggros: try aoe purge into mw
[0:52:04] murlad: funny I was just talking about playing mw then I got qued with you
[0:52:05] ArdellanDH: It's like the most random cc chain occurs when you are trying to kill
[0:52:06] ALLtheEXP: that's my only major gripe with DH. It's SO fun to play and i'm getting a lot better but i'm running into my 2-2.1k lobbies where I can't save my team mates and they die and I go 2-4
[0:52:06] boundric: @slummin36 i really hate that as a healer main
[0:52:10] magnusz: yea i feel like that when i play my dh
[0:52:19] magnusz: i feel that way at every moment of the game on my warrior
[0:52:23] Endoraesh: life of a zugger
[0:52:26] Endoraesh: just zug
[0:52:28] magnusz: so only feeling it a little bit of the time on DH is fine
[0:52:35] magnusz: play 3s on it and you'll feel it
[0:52:37] slummin36: I feel like that on a lot of melees
[0:52:44] magnusz: i hadnt felt that way until last night
[0:52:57] rekt1370: yea been liking spriest a lot you can do for the team
[0:53:09] magnusz: i went 3-9 in 3s last night. i havent done that poorly in a session since fuckin bush was in office
[0:53:17] DjemDruid: lmao
[0:53:19] orcrimmar: can't wait to see what awc will look like on wednesday
[0:53:20] keenomglol: Good noon ven. Just started a mage so now i need to pay attention how you play frost
[0:53:21] Datguyjay: OMEGALUL
[0:53:32] kreyzy8: I remember a few weeks ago when you said "if they nerf sub rogue, they will also go outlaw" and that's exactly what's happened LUL
[0:53:39] ALLtheEXP: @magnusz lmao
[0:53:40] aaggros: They really need to revert the fear buffs.  Its so dumb that you can almost die in a fear before it breaks
[0:53:47] kreyzy8: all go*
[0:53:50] rekt1370: fear still breaks insta
[0:53:53] magnusz: outlaw was already better than sub before the nerfs
[0:53:58] magnusz: just no1 played it
[0:54:12] kreyzy8: maybe but sub was also very good so people played both
[0:54:17] kreyzy8: now its just outlaw lol
[0:54:22] rekt1370: sub still s tier
[0:54:25] magnusz: sub just unironically easier than outlaw i tihnk
[0:55:30] therealzugzugzugs: big dammmm
[0:55:40] kreyzy8: outlaw has an actual rotation you need to think about where sub was basically do nothing outside of your dance go
[0:55:49] ALLtheEXP: BIG SPIKIES
[0:55:49] nerd_puncher: 341
[0:56:28] magnusz: yea but whats a GOOD warrior comp
[0:56:33] arx_war: what is this place
[0:56:37] kreyzy8: thunder?
[0:56:37] xDroozyy: tsg
[0:56:38] rekt1370: war sp was seeming good now
[0:56:38] Peacetreaty4: TSG
[0:56:41] pipebomblive: retail feels so wild west now. I was thinking about jumping back into it but I havent played since S1 and have no idea where to start, or what any of these new systems are
[0:56:46] PuffnTuff: is Thug viable at all?
[0:56:48] FlashZappa: @venruki how do you think ww/destro is right now?
[0:56:50] magnusz: tsg sucks now
[0:56:55] Peacetreaty4: Turbo
[0:56:57] heymomimonttv: thunder, tsg, ret war isnt bad either
[0:57:08] rekt1370: na has boomies eu has eles
[0:57:10] magnusz: thunder or war/sp are the only somewhat viable comps u could play
[0:57:13] kreyzy8: literally all of the eles are alts LUL
[0:57:13] Tiantoon: just use bot as ele, whats the problem
[0:57:17] nikthevoker: pokemonz vs jaime?
[0:57:21] kreyzy8: I could see war/sp being good yeah
[0:57:24] kreyzy8: SP pumps now
[0:57:29] rekt1370: i tried war sp it was good
[0:57:31] magnusz: u cant play melee cleaves anymore
[0:57:31] wyldeshock: hey ven. recovering from surgery and glad you’re streaming
[0:57:37] rekt1370: felt nice they going the priest and war i just blasting
[0:57:49] Peacetreaty4: turbo was taking games off kalvish outlaw rmp
[0:57:50] Nefraaan: what comp would you say can work with demo lock?
[0:57:52] metajutsu: is destro/warr any good atm?
[0:57:55] magnusz: u just fight lock/caster and lose by default
[0:57:55] ALLtheEXP: That's why I think DH/Destro and DH/Devoker are super good comps
[0:57:59] PuffnTuff: PuffnTuff gifted a Tier 1 sub to magnusz! They have given 6 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:58:04] magnusz: unless ur a dh or an outlaw rogue

[0:58:47] magnusz: yea 3s is the worst bracket by far
[0:58:55] rekt1370: swear theres a dh every game in shuffle

[1:02:40] ALLtheEXP: very glass half-full of you Ven
[1:02:44] magnusz: ye

[1:03:59] Abruty: I wish we could get glad mounts in 2s/shuffles as well. more people would play!
[1:04:07] TrillOGtv: is ven casting ?
[1:04:19] Mhortai: @nikthevoker Mog idk if they can use 2 because the weapon is unique

[1:04:49] dcode200: awc is 31 jan
[1:04:52] pipebomblive: do most people just play 2 accounts now so they have something to do while in an hour long shuffle queue??
[1:05:05] nikthevoker: he was testing the dot
[1:05:32] Mhortai: Weird lol. The weapon is unqiue not sure how that works. The TR doesn't ignore the unique thing
[1:05:34] ArdellanDH: I feel like that's what the blizzard solos mmr system does to people, I'll randomly match low cr , underwear players into a high rated and etc
[1:06:42] Mhortai: @nikthevoker nvm the weapon is not unique lol
[1:06:43] nikthevoker: dunno, the dot stacked too
[1:07:01] Mhortai: @nikthevoker The TR doens't take into accoutn on live you can only get the quest once
[1:07:34] arx_war: there is no unique on the weapon
[1:08:09] Mhortai: @arx_war Just said that above, but on live you can only get the quest once, where on TR you jsut grab it from a vendor
[1:09:06] heymomimonttv: almost every lobby i've played this week is double pally and 1 dh

[1:18:13] pisceslonewolf: Demo*
[1:18:28] buffrogues: locks are easy to kill
[1:18:37] pisceslonewolf: Prob the worst caster to focus imo.
[1:18:47] pisceslonewolf: Aff and Destro are good target
[1:18:56] rekt1370: demo can die just as easy
[1:19:05] pisceslonewolf: Except that is wrong
[1:19:09] rekt1370: lol
[1:19:10] ALLtheEXP: fcrrrushhed

[1:19:35] pisceslonewolf: They also don't cast and have more cc that isn't even stopped by CCing them
[1:19:37] pisceslonewolf: Sure they can die
[1:19:40] pisceslonewolf: so can all casters

[1:22:07] rekt1370: yea dk gets rolled
[1:22:09] NerdEngineering: no Prevoker?
[1:22:13] kyleuselton: at the high lvl of AWC can a good team win without meta comps
[1:22:13] ItsJhelo: to be fair cdew complains anytime rsham isnt best healing spec
[1:22:14] NerdEngineering: oh didn't think about EU
[1:22:17] pisceslonewolf: @venruki But BM???
[1:22:21] NerdEngineering: lots of Rsham mains there for sure
[1:22:22] DeityRevert: the dmg was so relentless
[1:22:29] rekt1370: @kyleuselton  not when the same players are playing meta its hard
[1:22:31] FlashWad: why are cleaves dead?

[1:22:34] fatulina: kasu maybe ?
[1:22:36] MaximumnNeo: sub bm thug maybe?
[1:22:36] kreyzy8: nah hunters are not it

[1:22:41] MaximumnNeo: bicmex will play sub thug\
[1:22:42] cmf_westers: wasnt hunter ret doing well on ladder?
[1:22:43] kreyzy8: Jelly is a demo lock
[1:22:58] cmf_westers: I've seen splay being unkillable
[1:23:00] Mhortai: with the fear changes I can see why spriest/lock is good
[1:23:01] rekt1370: scatter was looking nice too
[1:23:02] PhDickens: goood morning ven, happy friday
[1:23:05] cmf_westers: damp af tho
[1:23:09] pisceslonewolf: BM-Ret, BM-Demo, BM-DK, Jungle
[1:23:09] ItsJhelo: SP is nuts, cause SP is hitting hard, and lock is a raid boss rn
[1:23:11] chancywilson: sp with druid?
[1:23:13] kyleuselton: @rekt1370 thats unfortunate i like unique builds more than mirror
[1:23:13] MaximumnNeo: im not sure whether to play 4 set on SP, some top players do and some dont
[1:23:15] Roxxybolts: I think the demo version is best
[1:23:28] NerdEngineering: was watching Shadowplay last night and it looked strong against top teams practicing togeher
[1:23:32] cmf_westers: maybe aff
[1:23:34] jporter_: arent demo and SP tanks?
[1:23:36] Roxxybolts: I playted some destro splay last night and it felt good
[1:23:39] rekt1370: only reason they dont play 4 set on sp is to get haste
[1:23:40] nikthevoker: i dont think wizk plays the normal shit
[1:23:43] rekt1370: i find 4 set to be good tho
[1:23:44] cmf_westers: dispel protection for SP is pretty huge
[1:23:49] ItsJhelo: I feel like teams are silly to not run lock right now
[1:23:53] kreyzy8: I think mage lock is good
[1:23:55] pvalue01: i hate not having ms
[1:24:02] Roxxybolts: I was watching jelly play it and they played arcane demo alot
[1:24:08] cmf_westers: I would've thought frost destro rdruid would be super good no?
[1:24:11] MagickWarlock: i was crushing 2600 mmr as demo frost mage
[1:24:13] kreyzy8: kubzy and chun were playing mage lock too and farming at like 2800
[1:24:23] Borngood: we know why
[1:24:24] kreyzy8: they were also playing arcane demo
[1:24:24] Borngood: dont worry
[1:24:25] Borngood: LMFAOP
[1:24:37] Roxxybolts: I think arcane demo cranksssss
[1:24:37] wyldeshock: @venruki which mage spec should I play when I lvl and gear one for pvp?
[1:24:38] kreyzy8: @Borngood they were playing with toonah hpal
[1:24:39] zachgamegodx: i tihnk its cause we started the stream off with3's
[1:24:39] SharmaJenkins: do u think its worth playing 2p over 4pc as frost or not a big difference?
[1:24:41] Badasti: is mage lock still better than warrior mage?
[1:24:41] zachgamegodx: into more 3's
[1:24:42] kreyzy8: and doing really well
[1:24:43] cmf_westers: it's Hpala's lack of being a druid I think
[1:25:08] kreyzy8: kubzy and chun were playing the hpal version and it seemed just as good as druid
[1:25:13] sixthycent: just have your water ready
[1:25:17] therealzugzugzugs: i wanna a fat coke
[1:25:19] sixthycent: games gonnnnna be lonnnng

[1:30:22] dipicat: lowkey probs like the best comp
[1:30:24] Badasti: he may be Borngood, but was he Bornready?
[1:30:25] dipicat: @zachgamegodx factual
[1:30:25] NerdEngineering: in addition to shadow play, I've seen Demo/Frost Mage slapping on the ladder. Think it sees AWC play?
[1:30:26] Borngood: idk Kreyzy8 was saying the AWC team with toonah kubzy was owning with arcane demo hpal!!
[1:30:30] nikthevoker: Bdk does insane burst too
[1:30:31] Borngood: that means we can do it too
[1:30:51] pure__goat: think awc games will last forever with this damp meta?

[1:42:01] happyheals: the constant class balancing is the best part of pvp this expac
[1:42:05] Roxxybolts: I've never done that
[1:42:06] RdJIII: Is there a link to Venruki's Ui or list of addons?
[1:42:16] potatolockx: you see any aff locks? HmmMeeting

[1:42:53] SteLawBro: Feel bad for people who are good at the game because down here in the gutter, where only skill matters, the games actually crazy fun. When it gets competitive..Ehh
[1:42:56] Peacetreaty4: @Roxxybolts played against you running assa / lock / pal the other day... how did that comp feel for you? we were a sub arcane rmp
[1:42:58] orcrimmar: I feel like a lot of the people that say the game isn't "fun" are just going off of what the community/big streamers say. Like, I get that the game isn't balanced, but no game will ever be perfectly balanced. You are the one tha decides whether or not the game is fun and how you have fun in it.
[1:42:59] Metaphors: aff is better rn
[1:43:08] RdJIII: Thanks

[1:44:15] Xeliumimar: just 4 wins man and you can go back to shuffle
[1:44:22] Aurum81: Do make the crafted gear do you need to do pve? or can you just buy everything on the AH?

[1:49:18] ragergager: mast =350k chaosboltstho
[1:49:26] heymomimonttv: @LCSpartan roughly 10 minutes usually

[3:04:13] gjvl: Should entangling roots be instant cast but a 15s cd?
[3:04:23] hulkdieselx: @zachgamegodx ty!
[3:04:24] gjvl: I feel like I've never seen a druid cast entangling roots
[3:04:31] gjvl: Like hardcast
[3:04:40] Mcaveryst: wife out of the house = time to pvp
[3:04:45] Lythi: nah, i´m chillin at home jakbNICE

[3:04:57] Lythi: yep, thats my plan KEKW
[3:05:10] malvarcla: thats basically what I do when I was in a relationhip, day by myself = pvp day
[3:05:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm think mass entanglement is often not used in lieu of something else, but sometimes they run it
[3:05:44] therealzugzugzugs: constipated.
[3:06:07] DeityRevert: they get faster
[3:06:07] Puffeynick: any new vids?

[3:06:54] rockxtv: certified ruki mog
[3:06:55] malvarcla: Ven reminds me of my older self
[3:06:55] deckin4: always a bad egg in the bunch
[3:06:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[3:06:58] WardenDOTA: mog hater checkingin
[3:06:59] llseattlell: hopefully im as good as venruki one day
[3:07:08] Stoichulk: You can do one shoulder at a time and get rid of the big skull, I dont love it personally
[3:07:11] kalibus1: Venruki, tell Borngood he really took up the mantle for me as best pally after Belligerentz (dont know if this rings a bell) fell off. When I think of a good holy pally I think of him since like warlords ish
[3:07:23] deckin4: gameplay lover mog hater
[3:08:00] Mozaiczny: Wtf what that pyjama?
[3:08:01] ZThatch: ven, go pee
[3:08:05] KeasyKey: 7 years
[3:08:05] Mozaiczny: Didnt saw that
[3:08:05] Lythi: almost 8 years now
[3:08:07] XxGarthakxX: 2016
[3:08:11] kusoneko: 27 years ago
[3:08:13] malvarcla: no way Legion was almost 8 years ago
[3:08:16] malvarcla: I feel old agf
[3:08:18] Spaceberry_McDuck: dont think about it. it sparks uncomfortable thoughts about aging
[3:08:25] Baiae: wow
[3:08:40] kusoneko: what about Brain tho
[3:09:00] happyheals: Geez, I was living in the middle of no where playing at 740ms back then
[3:10:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: 740ms... that is a challenge by itself!
[3:10:23] willie_stroker_99: "I don't like him" hahahahahah
[3:10:33] happyheals: yeah, it would go up to 1200
[3:11:03] happyheals: at least I could play Wow in the Desert
[3:12:32] orcrimmar: you guys think playing on 10ms and going to like 60ms makes a difference? I have a friend who swears there's too much delay but i don't feel it
[3:12:59] kalibus1: Its not too bad in wow
[3:13:11] kalibus1: like, you have whole globals between every action
[3:13:16] kalibus1: which is like 1000 ms
[3:13:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can see 60ms being an adjustment, that would take a lot of practice to get used to
[3:13:49] serratedlove: @orcrimmar i went from 100 to 15 and it feels a lot faster, 60 is prob not as noticeable
[3:14:19] hulkdieselx: i play on starlink with like 150-250ms... not the end of the world with a game like wow imo
[3:14:21] kalibus1: you guys have some fps gamer reaction times then
[3:14:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Got him! Sweet
[3:14:25] happyheals: Once you go up to where I was at melee dps is not really an option, pvp is not an option. I just leveled caster dps and healers.
[3:14:36] Sillyon: When was the last time you faced a ret?
[3:14:39] Deezulll: you wouldn't feel a ~50ms difference unless you were trying to do something really precise, like kick a cast at the last possible instant
[3:14:41] e10100111001: pretty neat that druid sat full fear into rep into half hoj into fear into blastwave
[3:14:53] WardenDOTA: latency matters most for interrupts
[3:14:56] Lythi: i´m vibing with this playlist a lot
[3:15:13] Sillyon: Its pretty baller
[3:15:18] lucasthebestx: Do u have a lot of mastery?
[3:15:23] Neurotoxal: The Midnight is an amazing band. heard it earlier
[3:15:24] Lythi: nice. i´ve been on a Carpenter Brut/Gunship binge for the last month i think
[3:15:27] happyheals: if you want to feel 200ms difference just run a m+ with a Frostmourne group
[3:15:39] orcrimmar: The Midnight is such a vibe during late night drives
[3:15:43] rekt1370: 200 ms or higher is unplayable
[3:16:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah being on OCE server ping can really wreck a lot of players in PvE, I've seen it
[3:16:07] Lythi: ayy gratz on glad!
[3:16:10] malvarcla: Ive seen tots of ret at the 2300-2400 mmr range
[3:16:18] happyheals: no it isnt, I was running 20-24 keys in BFA with Oceanic groups
[3:16:40] happyheals: it is noticeable though, but I imagine PVP would suck
[3:16:55] orcrimmar: @wEiRdO_dUdE yeah, i didn't know frostmourne was a oce server when i played M+ with them once... i was wondering why it felt so laggy then half way through the run, i checked my ping and was like 250+ lol
[3:17:04] Deezulll: wasn't Chan competing in AWC with 300+ms for a time?
[3:18:19] happyheals: yeah tourneys that weren't lan and people have to play from EU with 300ms
[3:22:38] invincibledalyeth: welcome back
[3:23:00] ImJordanHi: Does Ziqo ever play retail? I know he doesn't stream it, but how is he so good at casting AWC without knowing the abilities...or how does he learn them...insane.
[3:23:00] twinkieruler95: SP games?
[3:23:36] Justinky1: KKona yer eatin the food mah food eats
[3:23:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ziqo plays it all, but yeah not as much retail
[3:23:52] zachgamegodx: plz delete him
[3:23:56] kusoneko: ziqo is a god gamer, probably just watches a few streams to find current meta and just knows from there
[3:24:19] Zataraz: And The Midnight is one of my favorite bands.
[3:24:39] Lythi: you also dont need to actively play a game to be a good caster
[3:26:13] Endoraesh: do it
[3:26:22] nightmxz: drop the belt for elemental lariat and put all haste vers gems in, get haste vers belt
[3:26:25] nightmxz: That's max haste
[3:26:26] ImJordanHi: @Lythi You have to know the abilities, meta, and what's happening though
[3:26:32] kyaii: I did it on my mage and I'll never go back
[3:26:35] ImJordanHi: @Lythi Which is quite hard IF you don't play it
[3:26:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Azael is a great caster too yeah
[3:26:48] keenomglol: I liked you,  Ziqu, Supa, and I can't remember the other guy that commentated. My boyfriend used to mod for his discord apparently
[3:26:56] Lythi: @ImJordanHi of course, but thats all things you can study even if you´re not playing. actively playing makes it easier, but its not required
[3:27:00] nightmxz: there is 1
[3:27:35] ImJordanHi: @Lythi idk if you can study that stuff tbh, you may be able to - but you don't know and cant really know the impact of abilities without playing. Every season there are new abilities that are make or break
[3:27:42] Snoogns: I can craft ring 5 star snoogly-tichondrius @venruki
[3:27:42] ImJordanHi: @Lythi and of course what they even do
[3:27:46] nightmxz: The lariat counts as 1 of your embelishments so you'd have to ditch belt for it
[3:27:46] Lillania: @keenomglol Do you mean healingstat?
[3:28:02] Lillania: yoyo
[3:28:06] nightmxz: Because it'll give you a proc based on your gems that increases your haste
[3:28:11] keenomglol: Yes that's him!
[3:28:16] keenomglol: Azael
[3:28:28] nightmxz: Ohhh a more even split of haste vers
[3:28:58] Lillania: Are you guys sure, about the embellishments as I run two + lariat on my mage
[3:29:24] Lythi: yeah lariat is one 100%
[3:29:29] ZhangTuShi: not all crafted items are embellished items
[3:29:42] zachgamegodx: ven did u quit healing or what
[3:29:44] Lillania: I'm sure lariat doesn't count
[3:30:03] Snoogns: it 100% counts
[3:30:10] Bullmarketlol: Clasp
[3:30:14] Snoogns: shadowed belt clasp
[3:30:15] Morodox: SHadowed belt clasp
[3:30:16] zeref_qq: shadowbelt clasp
[3:30:22] invincibledalyeth: shadowed belt clasp
[3:30:41] zachgamegodx: you quit
[3:30:43] zachgamegodx: dont lie
[3:30:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: omg he quit healing LUL
[3:30:47] ECH0F0XTR0T: 20 hours is a long time to not heal
[3:30:49] malvarcla: did you quit mage or what?
[3:30:57] Lythi: hey i saw you´ve not played fire in 5 minutes, is the spec dead?
[3:30:58] Jsun99: havent watched stream in a while, nice to see your hair back xD
[3:31:02] PhDickens: elite prev when
[3:31:21] Xeliumimar: Start the holy priest dream
[3:31:22] ZhangTuShi: hey ven i noticed you arent cuttently playing the thing that you played in the past meaning monk. will you ever play monk again why did you quit. is it bad? as a monk player i think its bad.
[3:31:35] ImJordanHi: Healing is mentally taxing, you can only do it so long
[3:31:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 2400 push is intense
[3:31:39] nightmxz: haste or vers chance yeah
[3:31:46] Lythi: procs the higher stat of the gem
[3:31:49] Lythi: i think
[3:31:59] niamha_: its based on the elemental type of the gem, when you hover them you can see
[3:32:04] Snoogns: @venruki I can make ring
[3:32:08] piribonz: Color of the gems
[3:32:15] ItsJhelo: bro the solo shuff elo sytstem is so dog shit
[3:32:16] nightmxz: Yeah if you have green it's haste, blue is vers
[3:32:17] Snoogns: @venruki snoogly-tichondrius, i have no public orders though
[3:32:20] Blitzylive: didnt someone just give you 500k?
[3:32:25] invincibledalyeth: you need gold ?

[4:52:15] happyheals: you like Tim Horton's?
[4:52:24] shinydunsparce: that blizz shouldn't put a no gear 0 cr player in a 2k game?
[4:52:36] soddi: 2,3k

[4:55:41] thisisthotcaller: maybe swap out sham for arms war and then yeah, pure aids
[4:55:51] happyheals: you had a bad lobby set up as well. You did a good job with what you were given
[4:56:02] FinkleTheMage: Yeah by his last game his CC was lining up much better
[4:56:11] willie_stroker_99: We've all been there man
[4:56:17] sourbutts: worst is when you have 2 sub par rounds in the first two and now youre getting trained every round
[4:56:20] skez_live: the worst part is he comes in at that MMR goes 0-6 and the healers both cant get any better then 3-0 and are lucky to not lose rating
[4:56:23] Blitzylive: maybe it doesn't suck to him and he sees opportunities to be better
[4:56:27] salv_za: not me, never try never fail!
[4:56:31] jamesip87: cause there’s that many DPS queueing surely it should have mix melee and casters
[4:56:31] haikugodx: play frost mage cmon man
[4:56:36] xantoor: i been struggling with my pres in solo shuffle.. i spam heals like crazy and they stay low..
[4:56:46] heymomimonttv: honestly he did survive a bit longer each round, so good for him
[4:56:48] Blitzylive: Ven we agreed positive vibes this year!
[4:57:02] xantoor: I can be top heals and it makes no difference
[4:57:04] ladidaada: Mage into MM lobbies is cruel as well.. still is
[4:57:09] xantoor: the rounds i win are when I help kill the target
[4:57:51] ilikegoldfishes: do dps carry on retail or do healers?
[4:57:54] W00dyyx: I remember when greenlizard didn't wear armor. He used to be comfortable in his own skin
[4:57:59] soddi: and you are right, as of battle.net he was all greens but 4 items xD
[4:58:11] 50victor: that priest was in full greens

[5:03:54] DamonRa: @happyheals that's in game. i was wondering if twitch had something separate

[5:07:29] FinkleTheMage: It should be hard, rewards like that shouldn't be given imo
[5:07:30] GenericPierate: and lfg for 3s died a bit with SS
[5:07:38] FinkleTheMage: Gives us something to work towards
[5:08:19] FinkleTheMage: Start making friends with people in your SS lobbies at your rating and start playing with them if LFG isn't fun for you
[5:08:30] FinkleTheMage: Tons of up and comers had to find people to play with the same we do
[5:08:38] shrimpsmacker: Maby not the right place to ask here but does anyone know if

[5:13:12] GenericPierate: idk BM is boring but like it has some crazy advantages against certain comps
[5:13:26] FinkleTheMage: I'm purely speaking on the vibe of the games, both tunes were dope
[5:13:27] GenericPierate: mainly it shreds spriests so hard and you can break fears on pets
[5:13:42] Vigi9413: Most metal music isn’t angry music lol
[5:14:02] GenericPierate: surv is like... better and worse into melee cause the blender but you do alot of magic dam
[5:14:08] Lemurion1: @ALLtheEXP i'm in exact same situation as you. Duelist, 2100ish exp, got my last one in solo shuffle season 1, but idk what happend to that bracket that I face rank one players at 1800-1700 and can't climb anymore

[5:34:54] GenericPierate: they have increased hp on top of the hp buffs and they reduce cds of like all their defensive options
[5:34:57] CaseysOn: they have cloak on such a low CD + cheat + vial
[5:35:11] gracioussatan: does outlaw also have CDR?
[5:35:34] wavyREC: not as  much as sub
[5:35:39] happyheals: outlaw can get a lucky early roll the bones and go off

[5:37:04] wavyREC: 2 vanish and cdr on defenmsives
[5:37:13] GenericPierate: yeah you just have to be smart with them
[5:37:28] armin_ed: RLD just got stronger
[5:37:35] helly421: what’s the root and fear change?
[5:37:36] happyheals: sub is easier to be bad at than outlaw is
[5:37:42] nightmxz: Outlaw can get a 15sec CD vanish if they have the right roll the bones and good uptime KEKW
[5:37:49] GenericPierate: spriest fear talent didn't get nerfed so isn't it basically an aoe stun now? rofl

[5:50:58] kusoneko: mage rogue is BACK
[5:51:08] GenericPierate: rogue might be running the low cd aoe blind if he isn't gouging. I couldn't te;;
[5:51:24] Cocoapuffs1: nice seeing im not the only 1 who gets tilted vsing those ppl
[5:51:27] FinkleTheMage: I like how AR lasts for a year and a half
[5:51:37] Cocoapuffs1: they literally play like robots just running
[5:52:15] limit77: 🤓
[5:53:07] FinkleTheMage: I feel like the uptime of AR and Tree is pretty dope.........
[5:53:47] FinkleTheMage: They had like 80% uptime on both >< SO stupid
[5:54:04] KycoGamaco: No hate, but why is it everytime I tune in on wow streamers they tend to be complaining about the game. Is it small thigns that build up to it or is it 1 major thing sticking out
[5:54:31] KycoGamaco: fair enough
[5:54:55] KycoGamaco: Like the 5% of the stuff that isnt tuned correctly or overloaded is like hyper outlier compared to th ebalanced stuff?
[5:56:02] FreddoB: Hi there
[5:56:03] GenericPierate: well it's also tuning into patch notes and seeing a minor damage nerf on classes that outlive everything into damp. Dev team seems out of touch on what makes things op sometimes
[5:56:29] FreddoB: how is mage if you are used to elly?
[5:56:57] FinkleTheMage: Has AR back up lol
[5:58:25] FinkleTheMage: The Japanese House!! Nice :)
[5:58:27] FinkleTheMage: Great song
[5:59:13] yemane: mage doing infinite damage

[6:03:36] supatease: if you cant beat them you must join them and expose them
[6:03:46] FinkleTheMage: lol Supa
[6:03:58] Cocoapuffs1: they play with dh and boomy sometimes instead of rogue and play the exact same way
[6:04:05] ZeraSeries: @supatease im gearing my blood dk because of you. Say "thank you" chat
[6:04:10] Axtin: sprint is actually ridiculous now since the rogue rework
[6:04:11] Magottx: only one way to beat em, blood dk
[6:04:12] waitimdesyncd: outluki

[6:04:20] poserdan: @supatease I can hear this in your voice

[6:04:33] skepperr: legit playing adapt not giving a fuk
[6:04:35] ZeraSeries: @eyetoons KEKW
[6:04:39] supatease: axtin feral too powerful makes me think feral is an outlaw rogue when he plays
[6:04:50] KycoGamaco: tbh i think the dumbest change they did this expansion was the cloak pvp talent
[6:05:19] Axtin: @supatease axtin feral is still worse than anyone day 1 outlaw rogue alt
[6:05:42] SwiisH_Tv: @Hi_Im_Kyco not when they reworked rets and killed the pvp participation in this game?
[6:06:13] Faketagsy: @Hi_Im_Kyco rets were cringe, but people forget early s1 assa/outlaw/ele

[6:06:51] Faketagsy: they pressed shiv and you couldnt get healed, was very interactive gameplay
[6:07:21] KycoGamaco: those are definitely fair, but what I more so meant was like the ret rework was tuned down so its long term effect didnt last. the rogue pvp talent change for cloak i feel like will last many expansions

[6:10:06] hennybound: games so bad
[6:10:28] shinydunsparce: DAE think games sould start at like 15 dampening?
[6:10:31] GenericPierate: god treants were a mistake
[6:10:33] jukeandnuke: love that npc healing...
[6:10:35] McLarge: Mystical got lucky on that Sweep
[6:10:38] shinydunsparce: literally nothing happens for like 10 minutes
[6:10:38] poserdan: @hennybound it costs a ton of mana though lol
[6:10:42] scoopzitV: streant strnk
[6:10:49] McLarge: Sent it into Blur, 50% chance DH could Dodge it LUL
[6:10:52] Elozern: @poserdan not as arcane :D

[6:11:27] McLarge: Treants

[6:12:20] shinydunsparce: just play druid 5head
[6:12:20] eyetoons: @MakuuuTV git gud
[6:12:30] skepperr: game is shite but we play everyday gotta love it
[6:12:32] McLarge: I feel like they should cost a moderate amount of mana
[6:12:43] FinkleTheMage: don't treants proc too?
[6:12:53] Lolo_kes: end of the day i been playing since 2005 lol.. always gonna play wow
[6:12:56] nikolaievitch1: it makes sense right
[6:13:07] Shway1013: def is with how damp works in solo
[6:13:13] vaseksybiceps: bro i have been playing since tbc and im mglad, i love this game. But its state atm is so terrible i prefer watching ppl suffer
[6:13:20] Azzulon: arena is pointless atm
[6:13:23] yimoxq: i started playing affliction in the last few days and its the most fun ive had on a spec in a while Wowee
[6:13:29] yesterday_potato: i agree
[6:13:35] McLarge: Tbh, I've been wondering if drinking just shouldn't exist in 2s + 3s.
[6:13:36] yesterday_potato: and no drink
[6:13:37] eyetoons: balancing around the average player makes most sense
[6:13:51] Axtin: maybe some middle ground between regular 3s and shuffle
[6:13:53] Dourme: buff dam or faster dampening, idc I'm so bored of games going to mana
[6:13:56] GenericPierate: wotlk arenas were sometimes slow but still felt better to me than Df
[6:14:12] KeasyKey: @GenericPierate so unbalanced
[6:14:18] armin_ed: ^^^^
[6:14:40] GenericPierate: cause like DF is dampening at higher end with the potential of 300k hits and random 100-0 swaps by 1 person
[6:14:49] GenericPierate: put both together and it's just stress

[6:16:36] Snoogns: mage named one school LOL
[6:16:40] LuckyBearLive: This 3s comp looks so anti fun for melee
[6:17:46] armin_ed: @LuckyBearLive mage/lock/x always been a pain for melee. But think it just keeps the zug zugs in check
[6:17:47] GenericPierate: he cast RoF. liar
[6:18:27] McLarge: @FinkleTheMage Alternatively, get Twitch Turbo if you use the platform a lot and watch different streamers too. It's cheaper than having subs in 3 different streams and removes ads from the entire platform
[6:18:45] FinkleTheMage: @McLarge This guy gets it :)
[6:19:12] McLarge: Twitch is unusable without Turbo imo.
[6:19:27] McLarge: The number of ads the company pushes streamers to play is insane
[6:19:48] Cerion17: I don't get many ads honestly, it probably works different in europe or idk... or in my country
[6:20:00] LuckyBearLive: I just stop watching when adds come up
[6:20:17] shinydunsparce: trying to watch wow pvp w/o sub / turbo is impossible. almost every ad is 'somehow' during a match
[6:21:11] McLarge: Some streamers have ads play on a set schedule. For example, you can set it to play every 1 hour on the hour for a set number of minutes
[6:21:11] acronymeu: just get u block origin

[6:23:53] poserdan: remove drinking and rogues

[6:24:03] DveevD: need some up beat music
[6:24:14] LuckyBearLive: It is really cool to hear the comms though. Y'all work together so well

[6:24:34] exercisefreak: windwalker was the closest of all it seems
[6:24:43] McLarge: It adds a layer of complexity and can be a skill check. But at the same time, it literally does nothing but extend games

[6:27:32] McLarge: Although, I'm gonna have to point out that part of the reason these games are so damp is because you're playing a Wizard cleave with a MW into RDruid teams. Those games are gonna be slow compared to melee cleaves anyway
[6:27:45] McLarge: Bigger issue is just RDruid I think
[6:28:50] FinkleTheMage: That enemy fel ob did work
[6:29:01] Stronkk_EQ: !drops

[6:29:14] McLarge: I wonder if an RSham would make this comp feel a bit less damp?
[6:29:32] McLarge: Extra Purges + damage
[6:30:01] McLarge: It's mostly RDruid that's the problem
[6:30:09] McLarge: Treants are just too strong
[6:30:10] Snoogns: ratJAM
[6:30:20] malvarcla: @McLarge there wasnt an rdruid in that game
[6:30:25] twinkieruler95: why is 2s filled wit healers dps
[6:30:35] McLarge: @malvarcla That game also didn't go on for 10 minutes
[6:30:35] xpaulzzz: !followage
[6:30:35] Moobot: @xpaulzzz xpaulzzz has been following Venruki for 3y 2mo
[6:30:37] SquidSosa: instead of hybrids being the issue like in shadowlands its now just tankiness
[6:31:01] Axtin: didnt u have a 95% damp mage lock mirror last week or something and it was hpal vs mw
[6:31:02] kreyzy8: trinket change + 10% stam buff was a big deal
[6:31:05] forggeesportsnutrition: Ven, have you eveer been to New Zealand?
[6:31:13] kreyzy8: its hard to get healers in CC enough to kill people before they go oom
[6:31:51] ooPickleRicKoo: problem is hp guys.. people literally get away with 10% hp most times when healers are chain cced
[6:32:10] ooPickleRicKoo: which is the change they did
[6:32:42] Lunarsloth_: It's funny i mostly play with and against melee cleaves and i feel like people die too much on random swaps in a single stun
[6:32:48] willie_stroker_99: Feral is so op
[6:33:13] Itankarenas: Stream over but I just got here? Sadge
[6:33:14] mufaasa_fr: @willie_stroker_99 no way
[6:33:28] McLarge: Melee are also super bursty
[6:33:29] BetterknownasJohn: easy to kick too
[6:33:30] Itankarenas: PepeHands
[6:33:53] BetterknownasJohn: i miss mop orbs
[6:33:57] MakuuuTV: hello ven, I am new to pvp and about 1900 in 3s rn, why are all of my opponents 6x multiglads in 1900? If they got glad before, wouldn't they be in like 2300-2400 now? Feels like I have no chance aginst them.
[6:34:14] LuckyBearLive: @venruki What's the "feel" in your own words of each mage spec in pvp
[6:34:27] twinkieruler95: 2s is the same with healer dps and youre playing double dps
[6:34:27] FinkleTheMage: Ven don't let that comment get in your head bro, you don't complain much at all. When you do, it's valid. Anyone who would comment about that, just doesn't get it.
[6:34:41] chachio_dk: Outlaw / Arcane / Rdruid bout to dominate AWC
[6:34:49] McLarge: Current projected R1 cutoff if the season were to end tonight is only 2645
[6:34:53] MacEleven: your mage looks so dope
[6:34:56] McLarge: Which is kind of insane to me
[6:35:14] Itankarenas: DH/DK in shambles PepeHands
[6:35:27] twinkieruler95: you think wer gonna see LSD from EU
[6:35:31] chachio_dk: Ele comps are very EU. Ele/Demo and Ele/DH and Ele/Outlaw
[6:35:43] ooPickleRicKoo: evo/boomie/dh is pretty good
[6:35:45] Poonpoon: when is season over
[6:35:51] McLarge: I'm expecting Rogue/Boomy again personally
[6:35:56] FinkleTheMage: Have a great day Ven!
[6:35:57] Itankarenas: Every time I watch Mes play ele  Iwonder why more people don't play it
[6:35:57] Lythi: have a good night Ven!
