[0:47:15] OvenMonkeyGaming: lol
[0:47:28] headshot_hunter6: april 19th is the reveal date
[0:47:34] MortiousPrime: But they just kind of plop this stuff in that undoes a lot of story in an unsatisfying way, with unsatisfying grinds, but really good raids.
[0:47:46] Sylphy_TV: He knows towPog
[0:47:48] ReinholdtRanger: I just hope the Jailer actually changes reality in some way before we "decativate" him

[0:49:53] Kaype92: Supposedly Destroyer and Arcanist got leaked for release next month also
[0:50:15] CritcobainTV: @Bargil92 Nah, supposedly destroyer next month and arcanist in may
[0:50:22] OvenMonkeyGaming: did you see the roxx the CM for LA "confirmed" the leaked roadmap but said changes where being made based on player progression so wait for roadmap. which is coming after the march content update
[0:50:25] jmalmin: If wow is smart. They wont actually have a Beta/alpha test of the next expansion. It hurts them more then does them good.
[0:50:42] CritcobainTV: Wut? They have to do testing to bugfix things lol
[0:50:43] Phase420: yeah especially if they are all doing it. They really don't have a choice.

[0:51:50] headshot_hunter6: 10 minutes till spida time!!!!
[0:51:53] CritcobainTV: Imagine they don't do a beta / alpha and then it's just like 'SURPRISE THIS EXPANSION IS SHIT TOO"
[0:52:00] jmalmin: With the hate wow has today the Beta/Alpha does them no good.  They can test for bugs themselves.
[0:52:07] grimsdale: what would you like to see?
[0:52:10] Fitz506: last 2 expacs were pretty poor
[0:52:45] KonaWolfeee: took a few days off of lost ark and damn did it feel good.
[0:52:55] CritcobainTV: I liked the grind of BFA, but I didn't really enjoy corruption, i got bored of it quick
[0:52:56] grimsdale: if you could add another class what would it be?
[0:52:57] headshot_hunter6: i was super pumped for shadowlands.... my god was i dissapointed

[0:53:10] KnsWoW: PREACH
[0:53:14] ReinholdtRanger: @Towelliee Do you still believe that 10.0 is going to be different? Different than a usual xpac
[0:53:15] Bonussize: HOpefully Lost Ark shows them players want the grind
[0:53:29] MortiousPrime: The problem isn't the amount of grind
[0:53:29] OvenMonkeyGaming: @Bonussize players want a fun grind not a boring one
[0:53:33] MortiousPrime: It's that it has to be fun to do
[0:53:34] jmalmin: 9.2 was tested so much that they dumbed the zone done because people complained and complained about stuff.
[0:53:34] KonaWolfeee: bfa was shit. SL was shit. legion was halfway shit. wow hasn't made a good product in years
[0:53:49] Gremmel: Shadowlands is the first xpac I haven't bought. Even BFA I finally caved a year after released and played. SL still nothing
[0:53:52] CritcobainTV: Legion was great lol

[1:08:01] jmalmin: 2023 release I would think.
[1:08:04] MortiousPrime: I would argue that that wouldn't be a saving grace
[1:08:10] ijaaxxz: my opinion WoD was prob the worst xpac
[1:08:13] MortiousPrime: That even if it's their best boss fight, it wouldn't bring things back

[1:08:46] clash_royale: New arcanist mage is literally twisted fate
[1:08:50] dalvynthedrunk: Draenor was a worse expanion, the community sentiment and attitude is worse in SL tho, so I think it has a bigger impact
[1:08:55] ijaaxxz: yeah also when WoD dropped was also a turning point when Blizz started working with Activision and i feel WoW has suffered since

[1:44:01] prime4563: Would you say gunlancer delivers mega dmg?
[1:44:37] Azphelle: @Critcobain I'm considering swapping mains at 1080, the struggle is real!
[1:44:39] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i hit 1100! I'm finally out of hell. Now i just have to wait til tomorrow to get my chaos dungeon gear KEKW
[1:44:57] CritcobainTV: tomorrows reset. i had to get mats to hone
[1:45:19] Azphelle: i am literally so hardstuck at 1080 xD i wasted materials failing at 80%
[1:45:20] CritcobainTV: BUT. i have 7 keys saved up for angushed isle, time to do that
[1:45:45] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee 6 straight fails on gloves. hardstuck 1335. so glad they are raining mats on us on new content. this is aids as fuck
[1:46:13] CritcobainTV: @Critcobain Good luck. I swapped at 1040 and it took me 2 weeks + of grinding on my gunslinger
[1:46:37] OvenMonkeyGaming: they are adjusting for player progression
[1:46:40] OvenMonkeyGaming: what ever that mean
[1:46:44] CptFruitBear: I think classes will stay the same but prog stuff will change
[1:46:45] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee rumored but even zeals is extremely certain. they did that in KR. whenever theres new content. theres a slight catch up for thos in the same tier that arent there yet. whether that means honing %'s or extra mats for free. we shall see
[1:46:51] OvenMonkeyGaming: most likely moving raids after argos
[1:46:55] MrSapient: Roadmap is being moved around..
[1:46:55] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[1:47:19] mi3f: hopefully it isnt delayed too long.  I thought them releasing new classes early was a good way to keep people engaged
[1:47:28] KonaWolfeee: ^
[1:47:32] Azphelle: @Critcobain I'm not in a rush, I was main-ing sorc but I have so much more fun on Shadowhunter....
[1:47:42] oleoay: i tried to do my first sailing coop yesterday, even though my ship was upgraded a few times and it was an i250, i died during the fourth stage
[1:47:45] KonaWolfeee: so many people are upset about destroyer and arcana being first. i had a blast with those two classes lol.
[1:47:46] OvenMonkeyGaming: roxx said they were making adjustments for player progression my best guess is moving raids afer argos by a month
[1:48:01] KonaWolfeee: @OvenMonkeyGaming that would be great
[1:48:05] CritcobainTV: @Azphelle I get that, it just felt bad for me trying to play with friends
[1:48:19] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee world events for sailing
[1:48:21] CritcobainTV: It's those random sailing events, whwere u have to rescue people in the water, or race to an area, stuff like that
[1:48:22] oleoay: there's a sailing coop quest that's also an una task, my ship ran out of durability
[1:48:26] CritcobainTV: there's like 3-4 events usually
[1:48:38] Azphelle: @Critcobain Most of my friends quit already :(
[1:48:45] DemonMega: anyone ever tell you that you kinda look like steven seagal?
[1:48:49] KonaWolfeee: i just want my iron man class dammit. im betting they save that for last lol
[1:48:55] oleoay: @Critcobain yeah it was like 4 events in a row
[1:49:06] KonaWolfeee: YES LOL
[1:49:20] OvenMonkeyGaming: bright side official road map is after march content update so we have a timeline

[1:51:17] OvenMonkeyGaming: i dont see us getting a 1302 powerpass with destroyer maybe a feiton power pass start at 900's
[1:51:20] Ascidious_: i dunno, them showing that they are gonna release 1 class every 2 months is kinda shit. if your class you want to main  is at the end of that list, youre just screwed for almost a year
[1:51:31] KonaWolfeee: @OvenMonkeyGaming agreed
[1:52:12] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee ill be honest i play each WoW expac and then stop playing. i like the fact i can boost to you guys somewhat and enjoy the content.
[1:52:18] mi3f: @Ascidious_ most games don't ever add new classes, I'm just thankful they care enough to continue innovating.  patience is a virtue my friend
[1:52:51] noyim1003: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[1:52:57] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee time for the anguished isle dungeon. I have 7 keys LUL
[1:53:05] DrkPhoenix6913: if blizzard made the boost like you suggest people would cry so hard (they already cry in it's current state)
[1:53:08] KonaWolfeee: yeah that is def booty cheeks
[1:53:13] Jeff_dd: wait u get a 148 ilvl toon? jesus christ
[1:53:16] Jeff_dd: thats like bfa raid gear
[1:53:17] OvenMonkeyGaming: each class needs to be localized im sure as well as any pertinent voice lines in-game that reference the new class need to be added. im sure they arent all ready just ready to go
[1:53:22] KonaWolfeee: @Critcobain quick question. i have 4. can i spam them or is it still a daily gated
[1:53:26] ChanJustWon: to be fair, if you are already friendly on another character, u can fully gear a boost to 226 for like 7k anima or some shi
[1:53:31] OvenMonkeyGaming: even if they are slow roll sells more money
[1:53:34] xXSiebzehnXx: A paid boost should never be lower than the current catch up mechanics
[1:53:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: 148 was weak at the start of Shadowlands, yeah
[1:53:38] Ascidious_: @mi3f i would agree, if these werent classes that are already released in both other version. Classes that are ready to go, but they are just holding them for a "content drip" is fucked, especially when that forces you to main something you dont actually want to play
[1:53:40] CritcobainTV: @Critcobain as long as you have the keys u can do the dungeon, only acquiring the keys is daily
[1:53:51] DrakhanGaming: You can get full 226 gear from zerith mortis though STOP IT

[1:54:17] KonaWolfeee: @OvenMonkeyGaming i assume you played kr way more than me but apparently the reason certain classes are coming out now and the rest later is ebcause each of them are getting a rework. people are complaining but dont realize they need to FIX the classes before we get them lol
[1:54:20] mi3f: @Ascidious_ you do have a point, I guess I'm just grateful for frequent updates rather than once or twice a year if that

[1:55:05] DrakhanGaming: Puts
[1:55:08] OvenMonkeyGaming: @OvenMonkeyGaming yeah some are getting major reworks most adjustments but i do also believe this has a lot to do with why classes like summoner where put on hold and removed
[1:55:17] Carahail: Party100 Party100 Party100 Party100 Party100
[1:55:22] OvenMonkeyGaming: destroyer must be the one getting the least amount of changes
[1:55:35] KonaWolfeee: @OvenMonkeyGaming i compeltely forgot about that! yeah i remember palying it in beta. when this game released i wa sso confused haha

[1:56:09] ttooang004: @KonaWolfee There will be a balance patch between classes on March 9th in Korea time.
[1:56:21] KonaWolfeee: @애니츠창술사 nice
[1:56:36] Kruuexe: @OvenMonkeyGaming sorry to interject into the conversation but I heard soulfist was also a class that was getting a rework? Is this true
[1:56:50] KonaWolfeee: have asian characters always been translated in chat ? i HECKIN love this feature BatChest

[1:58:47] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee curious where you stand with this. will you knowledge transfer your destroyer or play 1-50 to learn it?
[1:59:21] KonaWolfeee: true true
[1:59:27] ttooang004: It was said that the Destroyer Blaster, which does not receive the identity effect properly as a whole, is scheduled to be changed.

[2:00:29] ttooang004: There is a possibility that Soul Fist will also change.
[2:00:49] oleoay: makes sense that they'd rather you keep playing with a free alt than making you regrind, get bored and quit

[2:19:23] CrusaderNero: if they made 99% account wide, I would play much more.
[2:19:26] TuRDz__: wow is just NOT going to be able to recover. they keep doing the same shit they been doing. over and over.
[2:19:35] CrusaderNero: but not if 98% Kappa
[2:19:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Things like that Zereth Mortis forge and the Box of Many Things should have been account-wide imo
[2:19:47] RealSolaroid: They definitely need to make reputations account wide that's my biggest pet peeve
[2:19:51] R2RHIN0: From what You've said I have confidence in 10.0
[2:19:57] Dankmanarmy: And still they keep breaking sales records every expansion @TuRDz__
[2:20:09] Mattie_Gaming: they need to stop the treadmill. Each system should be progressed to the next patch etc. like in lost ark

[2:21:15] Magdelia: @tapartos i would stop trying to upgrade imo. wait till they make it easier to upgrade
[2:21:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah WoW has always had people creating alts and redoing content....it's annoying

[2:22:09] Ruyson: thats correct

[2:22:53] KonaWolfeee: @jayboost my guy youre defending WoW as if we are shitting on it. dont sit here and think WoW is perfect. lol.
[2:22:57] TuRDz__: blizz has ONE more chance on this next expansion to pull it together, if they dont. a lot of ppl are done with that game. its BAD when asmond hates the game now

[2:26:11] CardinalTX: Oops sorry, used the wrong term. I watched a WoW streamer buy and sell 15 tokens on stream. WoW is no different than LA in that regard
[2:26:14] DrakhanGaming: M+ just isn’t optimized for pugs in wow. It’s dam near impossible to do 15s in a pug

[2:26:58] Caloz7: Ive done all 15s in a pug
[2:26:59] Dankmanarmy: Maybe week 1 this week, but doing 15s a few weeks into the patch is not hard @DrakhanGaming
