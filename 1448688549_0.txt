[1:12:24] The_Mail_Man__: is tow meant to be live rn?
[1:24:52] Zettabyte: WeBack :D
[1:26:48] Clush___: do you think 10.0 will make wow poggers again
[1:27:12] Clush___: press x to doubt
[1:27:39] Shaele: I would be shocked if 10.0 would come anytime soon
[1:27:41] Clush___: cant wait for some arbitrary timegated grinds and currencies behind rep behind dailies zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz holy
[1:28:20] KragnosWoW: so any more rumors for dragonflight or just chatting about the same stuff?
[1:28:51] KragnosWoW: well the rumors are the classes or specs
[1:29:17] Shaele: heh that would be quite a shot to pull if they were to do that. Though the backlash would be cataclysmic
[1:29:17] Clush___: @KragnosWoW link?
[1:29:26] KragnosWoW: would you rather have a straight up new class or 4 new specs?
[1:30:49] LspN: link? :D
[1:31:11] KragnosWoW: well to be fair the classes werent balanced when demon hunter came out
[1:31:14] Shaele: that 4chan stuff was just a wishful speculation. Even though it would really spice the current meta up, it's not that likely
[1:32:12] lmtheboogie: Have any expansion leaks ever turned out to be correct?
[1:32:14] KragnosWoW: if there was a dragonknight class there would be two DKs LUL the confusion
[1:33:07] KragnosWoW: like zandalari trolls being able to turn into a pterodactyl like a goblin glider
[1:33:48] KragnosWoW: Aspect Power and Dragonflight covenants POGGERS
[1:34:07] Shaele: the necromancer 'skin' for demo warlock would be pretty neat though
[1:34:12] EasyPeasley: Covenant abilities are big Pog, I cant imagine giving some of them up
[1:34:14] Mograim: making 10 new entrances at wyrmrest keep for order halls KappaCool
[1:34:56] victoryz22: which aspect wld u choose?
[1:35:13] KragnosWoW: black dragonflight will have the best mog but bronze dragonflight will be the highest dps covenant Kappa
[1:35:42] KragnosWoW: did you kill the crab?
[1:35:47] victoryz22: being able to turn into a dragon to fly wld be fun
[1:36:06] KragnosWoW: oh nice phase 2
[1:36:23] EasyPeasley: @victoryz22 Sandstone drake mount in the game
[1:36:44] KragnosWoW: im stuck on heroic anduin atm
[1:36:52] victoryz22: @easypeasley is that one u turn into or just ride?
[1:37:08] EasyPeasley: You actually turn into it and another player can ride on your back
[1:37:17] victoryz22: oh sick
[1:37:57] lmtheboogie: Weâ€™d be like titan forged
[1:38:28] KragnosWoW: I think an awakened talent tree of some kind sounds nice kind of what you said
[1:38:48] victoryz22: wld u be able to easily switch covenants I mean talent trees? :)
[1:38:50] KragnosWoW: or atleast being able to awaken one ability
[1:39:07] EasyPeasley: I have higher hopes of them going with dragon aspects than I did with covenants, since aspects are already a known thing in WoW and not brand new

[1:41:21] victoryz22: as long as u cld switch flights easily cuz it was a pain not being able to switch covenants
[1:41:24] KragnosWoW: technically shadowlands didnt increase the level cap
[1:41:47] KragnosWoW: since the lowest cap was 60 in vanilla
[1:42:09] victoryz22: @kragnoswow but we did level to 60
[1:42:35] victoryz22: as supposed to been 60
[1:42:51] KragnosWoW: I dont see how they would do no levels when they usually want us to learn the lore and whats happening
[1:43:02] KragnosWoW: by questing in zones and stuff

[3:04:37] Dagomarus: dont overdose on that hopium before vegas bro
[3:04:38] captiv8: Would you want a legendary system like Legion in 10.0 Towl?  I miss it
[3:05:01] NBK_Sethus: tbh when they said "Legion's patch cycle was too fast" it was a kick in the nuts
[3:05:16] Clush___: hopium is what got us here Sadge
[3:06:05] NBK_Sethus: still remember Karazhan patch, it was so suprising and so good
[3:06:09] Maex: @Towelliee pick 1 good lore or good gameplay ?
[3:06:18] xrandomdoodx: I just really want them to implement the lessons learned from previous failures and not re-learn them all over again, like they always do every new expansion lol
[3:06:21] dravicustv: I hope Blizzard add a new AH mount in 9.2.5
[3:06:37] Chuckforfun: Just make less System more raids and dungeons GG
[3:06:42] Clush___: wow's gameplay is solid right now, it's all the other shit you have to do to get to it
[3:06:50] Clush___: i think classes feel pretty good honestly
[3:06:58] Lexi__Marie: and heres where people say i may be playing the wrong game cause im all about the story and cutscenes
[3:07:05] Alegnowar: i mean if 9.2 tells us anything is that they somewhat started to listen, so if they keep going it's gonna be good
[3:07:30] Rudric_Ice: Systems makes WoW nowadays lol its kinda Sad

[3:07:49] dravicustv: Legion have more bosses
[3:07:54] Clush___: almost all my complains are actually just having to re-play the same exact systems for every class
[3:07:57] Clush___: for every alt*
[3:08:04] captiv8: Nighthold and the last raid of Legion are my two favorite raids of all time in WoW
[3:08:25] Clush___: nighthold was such a good time
[3:08:29] Fllaffy: more mechanics and movement skills
[3:08:31] Rudric_Ice: Nighthold was my fav Raid in legion
[3:08:44] Clush___: im getting all nostalgic for legion :(
[3:08:57] captiv8: Antorus was sooo good
[3:09:06] Clush___: bfa dungeons in particular were my favorite
[3:09:37] Rudric_Ice: @clush if yu like trash yea
[3:09:48] dravicustv: details matters :P
[3:09:55] Clush___: i personally loved bfa
[3:10:00] Alegnowar: bfa was good, i played that much more than SL
[3:10:26] Clush___: @Alegnowar same
[3:10:34] facerolljack: BFA had good and bad things, SL was quite literally awful until 9.2
[3:10:42] Rudric_Ice: argus was better than nyalotha
[3:10:47] nyro____: I hope for way less systems and to cut down play time needed to stay caught up to raid per week.
[3:11:07] Dyasis: Nighthold was awesome
[3:11:27] jaina8675309: got my neck to 98
[3:11:44] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee how would you feel about some form of AP coming back? I kind of liked how it made old content relevant no matter what, but I understand the people who hated it too lol
[3:11:48] Clush___: alts were pretty hard to gear well with the corruption system at the end
[3:11:51] PhatKiwi: I have enjoyed coming back to shadowlands now that I am done with FFXIV
[3:11:58] chinfu303: i had alot of fun in bfa in a was a returning player but it wasn't bad if you played for enjoyment and not senseless grind
[3:12:03] Clush___: corruptions in arena was a wild time
[3:12:04] Eregbueye: but aren't most people play 3-4 weeks at the start of each patch and then leave to come back the next patch ?
[3:12:27] Scoodles91: the pvp quest gives a lot
[3:12:30] captiv8: the chests that require keys give more percentage i think
[3:12:31] Rudric_Ice: ill say BFA was fun with corruptions
[3:12:33] SativaRx: @dravicustv in an investigation? :D
[3:13:25] chinfu303: @Rudric_Ice ngl i really enjoyed corruptions but i could see how it was annoy if you wanted to get bis

[6:22:14] Jessethoth: You just have to use Dem Shout, Ignore Pain and Shield Block in my experience, most warriors try to tank without hitting those
[6:22:18] nitemare34godd: @lost_walle in almost 2 years only 1 time for thankgiving i tried to eat a few penut butter cookies ended up eating all of them and dipped them in penut butter so i cant do cheat meals

[6:23:22] Tokies: but no one really got super great looking items
[6:23:23] flebbooo: Warrior tanks feels like the least changed spec in the game since back in the day
[6:23:40] Jessethoth: Warriors are still mostly like they were in Legion
[6:23:40] kroknows101: if you hover when clicking the little dudes you won't dismount, game changer last night
[6:23:45] Xsilentghost: Do you think the Dragonflight cinematic will hold up to blizzards past cinematic quality?
[6:23:49] Jessethoth: They changed a fuckton from MoP to WoD to Legion though
[6:23:52] flebbooo: oh i guese Bears are worse LUL
[6:24:03] TeflonDon94: at least they changed sunder since TBC :D

[6:24:30] Tokies: the CGI better be so good that I see pimples on those dragons asses
[6:24:31] Jessethoth: Usually the pre render comes out way later.
[6:24:35] Xsilentghost: For all of Bfa's faults their saurfang cinmeatics were amazing and I hope they bring some form of that back
[6:24:36] flebbooo: We love coping here :D <3
[6:24:39] Jessethoth: I just want to see the features trailer, I get more hyped for those
[6:24:47] Rudric_Ice: they should we didn't get one CGI clip in SL

[6:25:17] miaemil: Tow do you think itâ€™s weird that weâ€™re moving on from shadowlands without bastion, ardenweald and maldrax not having their own raids?
[6:25:38] miaemil: Most expansions, each area had its own raid, weird this one isnt
[6:25:48] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will they announce beta?
[6:25:53] Mind_Of_Matlock: Is Wrath Classic confirmed
[6:26:18] Jessethoth: @Mind_Of_Matlock All but, there are all kinds of hints in the files.
[6:26:26] dranet11: their awc youtube chat literally has cam porn websites advertising mid game
[6:26:35] Jessethoth: @Mind_Of_Matlock Like I think the logo popped up in some Classic Era files.
[6:26:41] SamULJackson: imagine if the exac just launches 3 days after the announcement LUL
[6:26:46] SamULJackson: *expac
[6:27:00] Jessethoth: God that'd be a shitshow
[6:27:07] Xsilentghost: Maybe their further ahead then we think, copium
[6:27:15] Rudric_Ice: give us twitch drops for the announcement of the expansion  more people will tune in
[6:27:19] Jessethoth: They fuckin run an expac while also running seasons of the previous.
[6:27:20] SamULJackson: the secret expac theyve been working on since before classic
[6:27:20] Jessethoth: LOL
[6:27:26] WegPiraat404: COPIUM
[6:27:32] Jessethoth: Yeah bullshit, they behind AF
[6:27:32] WundertueteGER: alpha release on the announcment day for early feedback COPIUM
[6:27:34] dan_monk: February next year at the VERY earliest
[6:27:42] BigDP: is it a bit risky to announce something that is so far away?
[6:27:49] Jessethoth: I like the concept of Season 4 though, a "end expansion recap patch" shoulda been a thing forever ago.
[6:28:11] Jessethoth: Imagine if we had Throne of Thunder relevant for 6 months before WoD instead of SoO for 14 months
[6:28:17] santamex: I think the season 4 thing is great to try and retain players tbh, much better than previous expansion droughts
[6:28:28] Rudric_Ice: i expect the next exp to be around  march
[6:28:39] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Late Jan, early Feb is best case scenario
[6:28:45] dranet11: did you see the name of the wow mount for d4 was datamined @Towelliee
[6:29:03] Jessethoth: Sir Bobby isn't putting downward pressure anymore
[6:29:10] Jessethoth: He's ready to GTFO of there
[6:29:20] falldrgn: I think we get beta by summer at earliest early fall (august\sept) at the latest
[6:29:24] Jessethoth: I'm really happy if they take their time.
[6:29:41] Jessethoth: I wouldn't give a shit if expansions took 2 1/2 - 3 years if it meant way fatter content and better quality.
[6:29:53] SamULJackson: id rather them take their time and get things done before launching some lackluster piece of garbage
[6:30:07] biirrd: I really hope it goes in a way that its more common to play more then one char, and not like now that you "alts" feels so far behind.
[6:30:18] Jessethoth: That's true too
[6:30:30] SamULJackson: of course
[6:30:36] Rudric_Ice: @SamULJackson they took time for SL
[6:30:36] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Legion PepeLaugh
[6:30:57] altf4_ow: but there's still being rushed

[6:31:01] miaemil: Is it weird for us not to have every continent in shadowlands have its own raid?
[6:31:02] falldrgn: Imean WOTLK and  BC  were amazing and even they had their issues
[6:31:13] AveragePvp: @rudric_ice huh? No.. lmao
[6:31:15] epicpockettroll: sup
[6:31:20] Dyriks: I just wait until the expansion is over to play the game Kappa
[6:31:26] altf4_ow: you don't want it rushed
[6:31:45] Rudric_Ice: @AveragePvp they delayed the launch  remember ?
[6:31:52] Jessethoth: That is true
[6:31:56] SamULJackson: and high off copium Kappa
[6:32:02] epicpockettroll: I got 4set and exalted with enlightened yesterday
[6:32:02] Xsilentghost: Do you think we will ever see a continent as big as northrend again for a expac?
[6:32:13] Jessethoth: MFers act like every expansion didn't do at least one good thing.
[6:32:24] Jessethoth: And even then, opinions are subjective.
[6:32:25] Milanesa_De_Pollo: TBC was perfect Kappa
[6:32:33] Jessethoth: I've met people who loved WoD...I think they're insane but yeah.
[6:32:38] Simmo_rs: is SL bad?
[6:32:41] snorky29: what were your good ones?
[6:32:43] Rudric_Ice: nobody liked legion it was first launched
[6:32:49] Rudric_Ice: when*
[6:32:50] Sleepylol93: boomers call it netflix and chill we call it rage and play LUL LUL
[6:32:51] ZerefTheOokami: last good expansion for me was Legion
[6:32:58] Donswag3: I would just prefer that they try to carry/improve on a system to a new xpac instead of trying to invent the wheel with new systems every xpac
[6:33:04] Jessethoth: I really appreciated that Reagent Bank, 200 stack size, Heirloom tab and Toy Box in WoD.
[6:33:13] Jessethoth: WoD was very nice for bank space and hoarders.
[6:33:14] Crocfacex: How did  you like the new raid? have you guys cleared mythic yet?
[6:33:49] Jessethoth: I think people just enjoy theorycrafting so much they even theorycraft the design side as well
[6:34:05] Jessethoth: A LOT of armchair game devs in this community
[6:34:08] SamULJackson: you reckon they will stop after classic wotlk? i cant see them re-release cata or even mop
[6:34:31] theszoti: :O
[6:34:35] Jessethoth: I mean, if 500k people made a petition and they thought they could sell a Cata boost....you tell me.
[6:34:38] Birder_L: 2020Suspicious
[6:34:40] epicpockettroll: guild haste even stepped into mythic, cuz people keep yeeting out
[6:34:40] Rudric_Ice: Oooooooooooo
[6:34:41] flexyzEU: I loved cata
[6:34:43] Donswag3: they'd be smart to stop after wrath, not sure they will though
[6:34:44] SamULJackson: alright then, keep your secrets Kappa
[6:34:48] epicpockettroll: hasnt
[6:34:49] Darthyrevan: i hope they skip Cata, Do MoP then quit there
[6:34:56] Rudric_Ice: Inside INFO HEH
[6:34:57] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee i know people would like Legion classic for sure
[6:35:02] Jessethoth: What about the people who want cata though @Darthyrevan
[6:35:18] blightanker: well wotlk launch will be a miracle since you already heavilly fragment your playerbase between  normal servers/special servers / old content servers......
[6:35:21] Birder_L: i would love to do legion again
[6:35:30] Jessethoth: If they farm 9 versions of Classic all that money would theoretically help the product as a whole, why would we not want that?
[6:35:31] bigb0omer: ret paladins were gods
[6:35:39] epicpockettroll: rygelons voiceactin tho Kreygasm
[6:35:40] theszoti: Maybe they will release a Cataclysm: Reforged where they will put back all the unreleased an cut content, basically a Cata+
[6:35:41] KyzenHD: omfg
[6:35:44] Jessethoth: No Dungeon Finder? Pog
[6:35:46] Milanesa_De_Pollo: if they replace 10/25 main with "flex" it will be great
[6:35:49] Rudric_Ice: u don't love wrath bcuz u didn't know about arthas
[6:35:50] xrandomdoodx: #lotsofchanges
[6:35:50] Dyriks: '
[6:35:55] SamULJackson: keeping wotlk and scaling down the newer raids? that would be cool
[6:35:58] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 10/25 man
[6:36:09] Jessethoth: He didn't play WC3 right?
[6:36:13] SamULJackson: or something along those lines
[6:36:18] Dyriks: The "wrath babies" are gonna get nostalgia :D
[6:36:21] Jessethoth: Most WoW players didn't grow up with or play Warcraft games. No biggy
[6:36:25] Rudric_Ice: @Jessethoth nope
[6:36:33] Jessethoth: Fuck no
[6:36:45] KyzenHD: dungeon finder was 3.3 I tjink
[6:36:46] xrandomdoodx: I could see them rebalancing stuff like wotlk naxx so its not a joke anymore
[6:36:48] Thoreya: hopefully
[6:36:50] Jessethoth: Yeah if it has Dungeon Finder I'm out
[6:36:51] dranet11: i hope theres a dungeon finder
[6:36:53] Tokies: Using just the groups system would be cool
[6:36:53] epicpockettroll: How's ur rep looking?
[6:36:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Having Dungeon Finder will help keep it more relavent for casuals
[6:36:59] Jessethoth: I'd rather it being in Phase 4.
[6:37:04] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Dungeon finder will be good
[6:37:06] Niksen_99: I hope they add race change and stuff like that from beginning too @Towelliee
[6:37:12] Thoreya: gimme it on launch
[6:37:12] ZakuzaGB: how do you think they will handle Dks?
[6:37:13] reformedalex12345: if its there from launch none would level in zones and everyone would spam dungeons
[6:37:17] Thoreya: 2 min ques for leveling and shit
[6:37:24] Jessethoth: I'm not saying no changes.
[6:37:26] theszoti: was dual spec avaliable from the start of wrath?
[6:37:28] Rudric_Ice: there will be a dungeon finder for sure
[6:37:30] Jessethoth: That's just one change that can fuckoff for me.
[6:37:48] ourforcesready: I want to keep speed reading LFG chat
[6:37:49] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:37:58] Jessethoth: People running dungeons like bots, yay
[6:38:06] Magris: Fuck nostalgia just make sure its good for today
[6:38:16] Jessethoth: Muh convenience, you are right, spoiled community
[6:38:19] Niksen_99: Gearscore will be so toxic KEKW @Towelliee
[6:38:20] SamULJackson: @Magris very based take
[6:38:25] snorky29: whats you favorite expansion?
[6:38:27] Mockle: As the mighty Dwayne Johnson once said: IT DOESNT MATTER!
[6:38:35] Jessethoth: Shit I did 13 before reset and 13 after, I loved Wrath
[6:38:43] 1x3_: idk ive only played since MoP so its not nostalgia but not having lfg has helped me make so many friends on my server and see the community. I'm bad though so im probably wrong :P
[6:38:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Play Rift once WoW dies
[6:38:45] dranet11: 'if wow dies'
[6:39:01] Niksen_99: WoW is like 20 years old it will never die
[6:39:04] Simmo_rs: you think wrath will bring out anotehr boots?
[6:39:07] GrampyBeav: Wow will never die
[6:39:09] OvenMonkeyGaming: isnt wow viewership in general lower then ever
[6:39:11] Havoc_S1: Look at esfand
[6:39:14] reformedalex12345: wdym wow is dead since wotlk Kappa
[6:39:14] Magris: @SamULJackson i've played wow for 18 years including RE release of classic. not based
[6:39:16] Rudric_Ice: Ashes of  creation RIOT MMO lots of stuff for WoW streamers
[6:39:16] Crocfacex: wow cant die
[6:39:19] Noulex: Remember waaaaay back when getting boosted in dungeons was a thing ? I miss the whole Deadmines Boosting ^^
[6:39:27] dranet11: i thought ff14 killed wow BatChest
[6:39:27] Ardes6: @Towelliee what do you think of the current WoW? should i get back into it?
[6:39:30] Jessethoth: EVEN IF the servers all went offline...which they're payed up for a long time, a private server community would buy the rights to run legit servers...it won't die.
[6:39:30] epicpockettroll: gearscore is already toxic, thats why I didn't continue tbc raiding
[6:39:31] GrampyBeav: Wow basically opened the doors to mmorpgs
[6:39:40] KyzenHD: You have special informations ? :O
[6:39:47] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Nobody gives Wraths Ass Kappa
[6:39:50] Jessethoth: Then again, the Dungeon Finder would allow them to move Wrath along quicker if they plan on going further.....
[6:39:51] Jessethoth: Hmmm
[6:39:52] Rudric_Ice: there will some people on forums for sure tho LUL
[6:39:54] Bazsidiver: hope we get fresh wrath server so the economy wont be scuffed
[6:40:17] epicpockettroll: too many geared complaining plebs that die to frontals and standing in fires
[6:40:18] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[6:40:26] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @Towelliee can you confirm or deny that we will get Wrath info on then 19th?
[6:40:30] dranet11: lfg chat is cancer on tbc, hope they add a dungeon finder
[6:40:42] Jessethoth: Again, I was never a "nochanges" guy.
[6:40:48] Jessethoth: I just don't like the DF.
[6:40:51] quinraylo: I just play private servers
[6:41:06] Niksen_99: All i want to know is where is all those "No world buffs" people at? Because they are def not playing SOM its so dead
[6:41:10] Jessethoth: I kind of shit on Alexensual the whole time when he was acting like the devs needed to be on trial.
[6:41:11] Magris: #nochanges means u literally didnt play the shit to know the probblems
[6:41:21] Jessethoth: ^
[6:41:34] Flu_oO: WOD was awesome just some stuff was badly executed   but raids in wod and dungeons were amazing . @Towelliee  what do you think??
[6:41:37] Ardes6: yeah but people where idiots back then and it made it great
[6:41:41] Burmarck: Cata had some hard instances in the start
[6:41:43] Rudric_Ice: they need to add new content for classic+ not some stupid increased exp and shit like that add new raids or something
[6:42:02] Jessethoth: Wrath of the AoE King
[6:42:07] Brodih_: Wrath is when the mixed the classes and races right, like dwarf shaman, etc ?
[6:42:07] Thoreya: wrath was great. game changed a lot late wrath tho
[6:42:11] Jessethoth: Pull more than 15 and hit cooldowns all the way to the bank!
[6:42:14] KyzenHD: And that wasn't completely a bad thing
[6:42:15] ZakuzaGB: im a mop baby and ive played the game for 9 years how crazy is that
[6:42:27] Niksen_99: I think we will get so bored in wrath Naxx KEKW
[6:42:51] Rudric_Ice: i hope they buff the shit out of naxx in wrath classic
[6:42:55] epicpockettroll: heroic shh MonkaS
[6:43:11] theszoti: you ever plan to return to tbc?
[6:43:18] Jessethoth: Like I said before I was never a no changes guy, I dunno, it's just Dungeon Finder I hated.
[6:43:29] Jessethoth: But I might get over it, if lots of people are there.
[6:43:32] Mockle: there is a lot of nostalgia attached to wrath but it will be the same shit as with classic and bc
[6:43:34] Tauren0309: He forgot to press enter on the message
[6:43:35] Jessethoth: The important part is if there's people to play with.
[6:43:38] Tokies: that mount boss needs to be a time fight like sha. you can solo it and burn it at this point
[6:43:40] robbo1010: still playing any lost ark?
[6:43:47] Tharia: lol interesting that they announced at all
[6:43:48] Magris: @ZakuzaGB actually crazy. as a classic player who didnt play mop or wod i honestly thought that shit was like 2016 not 2012 fuck my memory
[6:43:53] Jessethoth: Well I loved it then, it's just the long term effect that bothers me.
[6:43:57] Crocfacex: ya i actually like the dungeon finder too
[6:43:57] Ardes6: i wish there was no internet for info, it would make everything interesting rather than depressing grind
[6:43:59] epicpockettroll: or u que up to rare only to serverhop to a corpse
[6:44:00] Jessethoth: People being shitters and griefing from other servers.
[6:44:11] Anatta_undead: I get the chance to play wrath of the lich king with my kids how cool is that?
[6:44:16] ZakuzaGB: @Magris yup haha
[6:44:17] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Dungeon finder will help keep Wrath alive as it gives casuals easy way to play
[6:44:20] Sleepylol93: Dungeon finder is very nice, i mean people dont talk in groups at all these days, not like its helps you not having one
[6:44:22] Jessethoth: It's just the cross server thing, people are more inclined to be shitheads through it.l
[6:44:41] sniperiusz: @Towelliee what you think bli$$ard will repair sinking ship (WoW)?
[6:44:51] Jessethoth: They will
[6:44:55] Jessethoth: The ship can be too profitable
[6:45:00] Jessethoth: No one wants to kill the golden goose.
[6:45:11] Jessethoth: True, they set the standard there really
[6:45:19] Niksen_99: I think blizzard loves that classic is a counter to private servers
[6:45:33] Jessethoth: It's just the double edge is my only concern, more toxicity in cross server groups, and people just don't talk now
[6:46:02] Jessethoth: Oh for sure, there's tons of shit in vanilla and BC that's kind of painful.
[6:46:12] ZakuzaGB: wrath is the only xpac im interest in palying that i never played
[6:46:20] mmo_kenna_: bro we all older and have jobs/kids etc. havnt got time to be spamming /2 for a group
[6:46:33] Havoc_S1: @jessethoth thatâ€™s every game is no one talks at all
[6:46:35] Tharia: do you mean the one after getting all three bosses down and the achievement?
[6:46:58] FlowsS_: wrath andies KEKW
[6:46:59] Rudric_Ice: i think we got a #nochanges
[6:47:00] Jessethoth: @Havoc_S1 Yeah that might just be a "the novelty of online gaming has worn off" thing.
[6:47:11] IzacCS: Daamn
[6:47:11] epicpockettroll: blizz will prob stop at wrath legacy no?
[6:47:12] Anatta_undead: They should have capped the quest finder group finder add-on or integrated it into the world of warcraft platform it's so much better than the Q. finder
[6:47:13] Niksen_99: Nice xmog
[6:47:17] Jessethoth: @Havoc_S1 It's just not as new now to be able to chat with people and people take it for granted online.
