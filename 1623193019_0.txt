[1:00:18] HenryChase: WotLK is dogshit tbh. Class homogenezation, gear homogenized and boring as shit. Everyone looks the same. No gears fun to find like Thrash blade, in fact, all the fun proc effects are gone. In its place is a poopoo raid difficulty slider that dumbs down the meaning of raiding and is so peepee easy that my grandma literally beat my Naxx 25 for me yesterday.
