[1:04:09] neftario105: Is he pooping 💩
[1:04:09] Connectus: But I'm curious what Iridikron and Xal'atath's influence will be in the next expansion
[1:04:18] Connectus: Curious to see what they're plotting
[1:04:33] Connectus: Sure, naughty void stuff. But in what epic fashion will they do it
[1:05:03] reaperblade93: Anyone else hates void / cosmic shit?
[1:05:11] Connectus: @DunzoCD Wouldn't be surprised as we've found out the pantheon aren't a bunch of angels this expansion. Just like real life, nothing is black and white
[1:05:23] mavericks312: No give me all the thanos shit
[1:05:33] Connectus: @reaperblade93 no if done right
[1:05:46] reaperblade93: @mavericks312 KEKW

[1:06:26] tlsmith3638: Watch guy the new arbitor going to became the new jailor and we have to go back to the shadowlands
[1:06:28] Connectus: @reaperblade93 N'Zoth was done horribly. The fight was epic, but the conclusion was really underwhelming
[1:06:44] neftario105: When Illidan returns?
[1:07:00] neftario105: You are not prepared
[1:07:00] AnimalCrackers_19: did stream end?

[1:07:50] reaperblade93: We need df 2.0 but with other theme, say dwarves?
[1:08:02] tlsmith3638: Lol sounds about right

[1:09:20] reaperblade93: @nebulizer87 why u didn’t like df?
[1:09:20] Zettabyte: LOVE getting "Thank you for your report" message when logging into Overwatch towLove
[1:09:31] Nebulizer87: this is prob my least played expansion
[1:09:32] Connectus: We hop to a new set of dragon isles, their visages are all pirates
[1:09:37] PotbellyGoat: will we have canoe riding in the island expansion?
[1:09:41] Connectus: Mike Ybara lied! Kappa
[1:09:41] mavericks312: @nebulizer87 hate to break it to you but future xpacs will be done the way DF has been done especially with how successful it’s been

[1:10:24] reaperblade93: More than sl and bfa
[1:10:29] Connectus: This expansion did a lot of things right, story telling is better than Shadowlands MingLee
[1:10:35] DeanoTV: @Nebulizer87 truee
[1:10:36] Collected1: Nebulizer87 : i didn't even hit max level
[1:10:43] kyotoboss: can always do m+ :D
[1:10:49] Connectus: @Collected1 rip
[1:10:51] Collected1: but then that's more down to me being done with the game generally after so many years
[1:10:51] Molvonos: Definitely a casual's expansion.
[1:10:58] neftario105: BFA was better than Shadowlands
[1:11:03] DunzoCD: i mean you can not like it, but its gonna be DF 2.0 style, they found a formula that works to keep casuals around and give raid content at consistent intervals, its just the seasonal style
[1:11:09] Molvonos: As soon as I got KSH and AOTC, I was basically done.

[1:12:39] DeanoTV: WoW is an MMO though, ur supposed to play alot
[1:12:44] Molvonos: @DeanoTV Says who?
[1:12:45] crymeog: gasp no
[1:12:52] Molvonos: That's some jank logic.

[3:09:33] barrowzz: It’s all a fever dream. Hogger has us locked in a dungeon right now we never killed him at level 10
[3:09:36] valianya: Undermine was Goblihn homeland, they evolved there by mining Kaja'mite that radiation made them from burrowing slave race to cracked high IQ wacky inventor race
[3:09:52] HaloS23: Maybe mother of the other 4?

[3:10:52] HaloS23: I can see that happening when they want to do a giant reset
[3:10:57] falldrgn: I like it, the PS remote play needs some work. If you have game pass most of the stuff is compatible.

[3:12:07] SirDenarius: They need to do something with the old zone so old content become relevant :)

[3:12:21] Molvonos: Light, Fel, Order, etc.
[3:12:28] AvrithSATX: Wait, I've seen this before. When Azeroth the Titan tries to awaken, the Eternals... er Watchers... betray the Titans and stop Azeroth by turning her to stone.
[3:12:29] abracka_: whoever busts first loses and has to leave azeroth
[3:12:31] thecynicalshuffler: its ok, if its in a 3-way :)

[3:21:59] Chronollo: @Towelliee They should do a graphic revamp of Retail WoW, and incorporate more blood, gore, sweat, tears, real conflict, etc. going back to the roots of the game. Otherwise, if not, then something with classic would have to be done

[3:24:39] neftario105: Cata is next?
[3:24:46] MILESkg21: Classic Reforged DansGame nope
[3:24:53] falldrgn: Classic: Timelines
[3:24:56] SirDenarius: Its weird with classic+ dont you just end up with 2 retail to manage ^
[3:25:03] cschimp: They could get super creative and call it Old School World of Warcraft
[3:25:05] zysmos: Cata but they fix dragon soul
[3:25:06] ArcaneSyntax: @thegiant99 it already is really close.
[3:25:11] Shrenko: Im just saying it again... Turtle wow

[3:26:51] jarilrpg: shouldnt BFA timewalking come this expansion?
[3:26:52] zysmos: BFA classic is gonna be lit

[3:28:03] rhodistar: 40 man raiding towCopium
[3:28:04] Jango_: For guilds that dont have 30 people
[3:28:04] ArcaneSyntax: I mean 10 man raiding never left heroic.
[3:28:10] SirMaldo: Are they not doing virtual tickets for blizzcon this year? I dont see anything
[3:28:13] Jango_: that still want to do hard content
[3:28:15] zysmos: Get rid of 20 man
[3:28:17] falldrgn: from a tuning to a WF race.. it messes things up.
[3:28:25] Hu33ard: @Jango_ just recruit people?
[3:28:27] Khooya_: we have 10 man raiding in the game, just go in with 10 people 🤷
[3:28:37] DunzoCD: @SirMaldo blizzcon is free to watch this year, the "virtual ticket" is just collectables
[3:28:37] bypized: @Towelliee I think they have put themselves in a corner with the talent revamp that in order for the game to feel different the next expac they will need to bring borrow power back. Thoughts?
[3:28:46] TurtleThumbWar: I need a west coast guild to join
[3:28:49] Jango_: @Hu33ard We have been together as a guild since vanilla and like our crew
[3:28:56] thecynicalshuffler: @sirmaldo,  its free to watch only have to pay if you want the goodies
[3:28:58] Chronollo: @Towelliee Check Runescape 3 (Retail) and Oldschool Runescape (Vanilla+) on the runescape website. Check the player populations on each.
[3:29:01] strike879: 10m hc difficulty that gives currency instead of gear
[3:29:05] ArcaneSyntax: They should make mythic lockout like the heroic and normal ones though
[3:29:09] Hu33ard: @Hu33ard you might like the new people too!
[3:29:10] SirMaldo: Got it....thanks all!
[3:29:12] Wasaburashi: i feel like raiding needs a reformat from Mythic 20 man to like 10 man would be waaay easyer to form groups and sucj
[3:29:20] Rictamar: people vastly overestimate the amount of players that want to even attempt mythic, its so minuscule lol
[3:29:31] Hu33ard: @Wasaburashi it would suck
[3:29:34] thecynicalshuffler: SeemsGood
[3:29:43] Jango_: @Hu33ard its not for lack of trying, just havent found people that are a fit

[3:30:00] CatsRusOfficial: Honestly they should turn Classic into Timelines. Allow player to travel through Chromie Time as if they were moving through classics.   Players move forward intime, play the expansion as it was released and then when they want to, if they want to. Move to the next expansion with that character.
[3:30:02] beastoburden: !leaks
[3:30:03] Hu33ard: @Hu33ard it doesn't though
[3:30:05] ArcaneSyntax: There are way too many required classes for 10 man mythic
[3:30:10] SSD511_: 10 man raid will make alot of players quit their guild or maybe raiding in general
[3:30:22] mavericks312: Those 10 ppl would just be the buff classes
[3:30:24] zysmos: remove raid buff
[3:30:27] DunzoCD: they would have to bring back scrolls if they went back to 10 mans
[3:30:32] XLcoj: Also imagine how many more tnaks we would need for all those extra heals and dps that are without a spot
[3:30:42] Hu33ard: @SSD511_ facts I would quit
[3:30:46] xrandomdoodx: RIP ele/resto shaman if 10 mans   lol
[3:30:53] barrowzz: Scrolls
[3:31:00] valianya: Just bring Flex to Mythic.
[3:31:04] zeeAbe: Warlock cookies should be gone in 10 man, otherwise wlock is instantlyt OP
[3:31:05] d2darkalliance: They should change mythic raiding to 40 man
[3:31:05] Sharkeys: honestly if class/spec balance was better 10 man could work its just dps is all over the place it puts some specs as never invite
[3:31:07] Wasaburashi: yeh sure i get your point but then i think raiding is flawed by dessign if we where to think of those things dont you think ?µ
[3:31:12] Khooya_: the only thing mythic needs would be the id lockout some time after rwf
[3:31:16] HooDGorE: drums are the solution
[3:31:25] Darmonevil: augvokers would be nuts in a 10 man
[3:31:27] ArcaneSyntax: Wow has like 40 specs, it needs 20 man mythic to even halfway accommodate all the specs
[3:31:28] kyotoboss: @barrowzz go play classic :D
[3:31:42] valianya: If you can get more than 10, it flexes.
[3:31:48] ashwing_: 2 Augs even
[3:32:00] Khooya_: id lockout removal ofc*
[3:32:24] oradros: i can already see rogue bard spec for april fools
[3:32:30] falldrgn: Thats why they made heroic scaleable
[3:32:32] TheRealAxiom: 11-15 keys
[3:32:34] TheRealAxiom: and heroic
[3:32:35] fadthl: 10-15 or heroic raid
[3:32:37] valianya: Bring back 40 man raids to fit every spec
[3:32:40] Wasaburashi: also hope wow becomes F2P now that Xbox has the franchise although its highly unlikely
[3:32:47] ArcaneSyntax: Flex raiding is extremely wonky. It's fine for heroic but mythic needs tighter tuning than flex can provide.
[3:33:04] brimtank: you would essentially make it more formatted for less group activity. I mean if you can 10 man a mythic raid how hard would the other difficulties be?
[3:33:11] Vexica22: 20 man mythic feels good
[3:33:18] ashwing_: If ppl want 10 man they just have to settle for HC raiding simple
[3:33:28] Kauko13: what happened to Ion? We barely hear from him...
[3:33:30] beastoburden: No it def would

[3:33:55] Jango_: yeah, that wouldnt be good
[3:34:03] kyotoboss: massive
[3:34:14] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee do you agree with getting rid of raid buffs or homogenizing them to make it all classes/specs on a more even playing field?
[3:34:50] Wasaburashi: i genuinly dont think Mythic raiding is like a 1% type of thing tho most people dont go mythic simply cuz they dont wana try it , i raided Mythic back in BFA and BOD was not that hard

[3:40:28] johniiv: We still don't know what the legendary weapon does. My guild still waiting. We have a Pally Tank and we're waiting to know if I play BDK or PWarrior since Arms or Fury might not be that great
[3:40:33] DeanoTV: niceee

[3:40:38] Aquadriel: thats nice
[3:41:02] Redpandalol: @Towelliee imagine you get the item needed for the leggo axe before your dps because its personal loot
[3:41:04] Jarlan23: arms does good dps on ptr from what i hear it's just the spec is broken

[3:45:27] abracka_: he finished em
[3:45:35] Texas_Mizfit: LFR week 1 has 2 tier bosses
[3:45:37] homewrecker101: hes only got the dh to do

[3:46:10] strike879: so if you get 12 mythic crest from a 16 do you also get 12 hc crest after cap or do you get 72 because 6 hc crest = 1 mythic crest?
[3:46:12] TurtleThumbWar: kinda wish I was further along with my frost mage so i could raid but then again I'm still learning soo much, i'm just not ready for raids
[3:46:18] oradros: he did most of them but dh and rogue he was waiting until they made the change
