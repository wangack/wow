[3:46:20] Carrotsuno: omg I got shoulders but they weren't the ones I wanted. Pain
[3:46:33] Respls: Dude the axe is overkill on ret it performs way better for them
[3:46:54] Tsuki_aka_Moon: I was looking at your pvp videos to understand why I suck. You have horn sound and display of off cooldown - can you share the name of this aura?

[3:49:30] Tsuki_aka_Moon: damn man... arms feels so useless at shuffles, or rather most of other specs seems just so much more broken
[3:49:41] Treenax: did you guys see the mythic dungeon tournament going on?  ret pally is the healer this season
