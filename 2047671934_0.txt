[2:04:12] Nicohan95: spec is scuffed play shadowplay
[2:04:22] ShadowbladeRai: so you wait on the go for shark?
[2:04:23] OG_Sparrow_: so you run 4piece then
[2:04:27] OG_Sparrow_: if you're playing like that?
[2:04:28] spinachdipminiatures: or is the 20% multiplicative? like 20% of current crit or an additional 20%?
[2:04:32] Nynxii2k_: i forget what does jdcvswotrirs stand for again i know jack diet coke but forget the rest

[2:07:48] steveholt_: STUPID dam brah
[2:07:49] DoYouSeeOk: you mean left hand ?
[2:07:53] suspicious94: but the 40% means every ability crits during shark buff
[2:07:57] cadursantos: Hey hey! What is the best rogue spec for rbgs.

[2:08:28] kreyzy8: haste does nothing for outlaw though
[2:08:31] rizdane: haste=energy=dmg
[2:08:34] beastboyy122: haste is trash
[2:08:36] beastboyy122: lol
[2:08:39] kreyzy8: yeah haste sucks
[2:08:44] Darkminst: isnt haste bad for every spec of rouge?
[2:08:48] exxidtherog: 0 haste
[2:08:49] djshadowrotterdamn: thats a crazy xmog dayum
[2:08:50] Torbzen: both trinkets are haste brah
[2:08:57] exxidtherog: all the top 3s outlaw rogs
[2:08:57] loldave: What was the math on this?  Been in and out of listening.
[2:08:57] Nicohan95: @suspicious94 it’s like 75% for other abilities but you’re not using other abilities during your burst window
[2:08:58] rizdane: u also get alot of main stat which >mastery
[2:09:00] exxidtherog: all 0 haste
[2:09:00] OG_Sparrow_: haste is bad cause its only beneficial if you hit a certain level which takes away too much other stats for rogue
[2:09:09] davehammer: recraft fring remove embel
[2:09:11] DoYouSeeOk: you can get rid of embelishments with an item that replaces it
[2:09:11] timmah25: craft a belt
[2:09:14] phanabananana: recraft it and drop the embellish
[2:09:14] Perdd_: @Torbzen on-use conquest trinket is crit
[2:09:18] belvedee: I'll say this... trill using on-use trinket

[2:09:33] dresta11: hello
[2:09:34] luxumbra69: check shark buff uptime.
[2:09:38] JoeyIsLoud: @Pikabooirl having shadow dance / shadow blades / symbols on macro super bad? like can i have any of those combos on a macro im trying to learn rogue daddy
[2:09:42] luxumbra69: you run 40% for when you dont have shark
[2:09:45] chillyzilly32: LIKE A STONNNNNEEEEEEE
[2:09:45] JoeyIsLoud: ad dont answer
[2:09:47] Nicohan95: 40% + 20% BTE + 15% sharks for all other abilities, but you only use BTE
[2:09:49] JoeyIsLoud: pls god dont answer
[2:09:56] JoeyIsLoud: 2 min ads hol up
[2:09:58] mexicanrambo082214: what’s up pika. haven’t watch the stream in a bit! how’s things going?
[2:10:06] ceelos23a: bro i was coping your build for outlaw so fried!!!!!
[2:10:25] hunter31753: so @pikabooirl does this mean sub gear is good for outlaw
[2:10:25] bobby_lazar: @JoeyIsLoud no you dont macro those togetther
[2:10:32] OG_Sparrow_: @mexicanrambo082214 awkward xD
[2:10:35] pmanfit91: The games yesterday, Trill's mastery was higher. You could tell based off of details. Main Gauche or whatever was high on his damage output.
[2:10:42] Metallicpain: have you tried doing more damage?
[2:10:48] Nicohan95: if you don’t have shark then u are missing 15% crit anyways, mastery is more consistent if you don’t have the buff, you also don’t have as hard of DRs because mastery isn’t soft capped
[2:10:53] Metallicpain: i heard haste is low key busted
[2:10:58] JoeyIsLoud: @JoeyIsLoud elaborate
[2:11:00] Metallicpain: you should try it

[2:16:28] rakizz: u had 78-80k dps there
[2:16:32] wullex28: idk bro with mastery gear u guys won faster tbh
[2:16:35] McLaughlin11: do you think its playable with mastery gear or have to crit?
[2:16:37] wullex28: mastery > crut
[2:16:41] kronic_916: i think mastery is better tbh
[2:16:44] crymorre: have you tried haste Kappa
[2:16:45] iHateUsingTwitch: just ran some M+ with my boss... so if i'm late for work tomorrow i can blame her for being up late carrying her through dungeons on my pali

[2:17:00] dagcd: have you tried intelligence build?
[2:17:00] goat_lives_matter: prolly
[2:17:02] OG_Sparrow_: RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
[2:17:03] FS930: @pikabooirl sorry about asking again man. Which addon that shows all the spell CD in the middle of your screen?
[2:17:05] Billinz: agreed DFM
[2:17:07] fizola: nope
[2:17:08] FritosCrunch: you need to look at dps during windows where people can actually die, not just overall
[2:17:08] OG_Sparrow_: <3 lol jk i love you
[2:17:08] ItsKahuTV: if it doesnt matter, why not just stack mastery
[2:17:11] JSaucy_v1: honestly it seemed the same
[2:17:16] shox987654321: you highest peek was 120k dps tho
[2:17:17] ItsKahuTV: cause you get the crit anyways
[2:17:17] pragma90: true, whatever gear i use i still lose
[2:17:18] subhiim: with mastery you dominatet the match more so…
[2:17:19] RosaBraylan: Gear > skill
[2:17:20] inhumed: crit is nice because it helps the pistol shot so much
[2:17:22] nurotv: I don’t think it matters.
[2:17:23] gmiramontes86: dude back in BoC everybody went swords and i went fist weapons and i was always top dmg in raids. i feel crit was always good. you got an extra attack with swords but i was always doing double dmg with crits sooo
[2:17:25] JSaucy_v1: your openers between the two games were a little different though too
[2:17:26] Perdd_: @FS930 OmniBar
[2:17:27] inhumed: if you're playing lethality
[2:17:30] DaraxBarex: your skill so high gear dont matter kekw
[2:17:30] JSaucy_v1: first game you went heavy on cc
[2:17:34] JSaucy_v1: that game you sent dam
[2:17:37] gmiramontes86: BC not BoC
[2:17:42] wullex28: so instead of playing 25% or 40% maybe just meet in the middle and play 33% lmao
[2:17:42] Somanie: Do boomkin shit and stack some of both
[2:17:44] knewen: id love to see a full mastery build!
[2:17:54] hollow1zed: holy shit pika is using omnicd???

[2:39:52] chrye_xx: bro can’t play the game lol
[2:39:54] Sassper: why is Sub rogue dead? did they get nerfed, or was outlaw buffed?
[2:40:07] revzzz1: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance

[2:42:48] averagenjoyerrrr: hahha
[2:43:11] OG_Sparrow_: @Perdd_ but dw its normal for people like you to purport their own reality and they dont realize that the entirety of the world is literally like....whyyyy do you even exist
[2:43:52] OG_Sparrow_: @Perdd_ hahaha good for you buddy. try to lay off the LSD <3
[2:43:52] XDANK_WEEDX: @UptownGzz step 1 pick a build from the top 10 in the pvp ladder playing the class you want to, step 2 read your talents and practice rotations on dummys, step 3 que some random bgs and get the hang of the class and rotations in live combat, step 4 download gladius addon through courseforge and setup the addon (its pretty decent default) step 5 play some skirmishes till your comfortable and then try some ranked solo shuffle or 2v2s
