[0:14:27] BigPatty123: morning jb
[0:14:43] frazlord: There is also no healing in this fight
[0:15:35] frazlord: actually looks like he didn't have heart of the wild so it would have been more

[0:31:26] RVSoft: is no rejuv playstyle any good if I'm completely mastery haste stacked?
[0:33:17] Suka025: @RVSoft Not sure for high keys, but for like 20-24 range its better than rejuving even with high mastery/haste

[0:41:35] Whitewolf1441: hey jb important question, how come you dont run master shapeshifter?
[0:42:35] tr1plus: it's a dungeon balance thing imho. If a key can be done without a healer, there is a lack of a certain damage profile that should be taken care of by a healer
[0:42:52] ayyylmar: alkXD
[0:43:16] timmayb166: is it not fun to see once and awhile though?

[1:21:12] theBroHam: he learns he hates everyone that ran 4dps KEKL
[1:21:36] dorki: y not
[1:22:37] goilen: You can't do the whole tech without warlock but you can probably snap the mage to chromie without warlock if everyone are nelf?
[1:24:24] theBroHam: with a tech like that, do they have to clear with Blizz first?
[1:25:44] kelly_mac06: i really enjoyed how good all the matches were this past weekend. It was super fun to see
[1:28:25] Kerandes: wait wtf why is @dorki still awake
[1:28:37] theBroHam: I had a lot of fun watching. Echo is the fav, but obviously will still root for Last Hope
[1:29:37] edde15926: what addon is it that adds the absorb shields expanding out to the right of your party frames?
[1:30:19] mr__pear: he ice blocked + dwarf
[1:30:25] mr__pear: should've saved dwarf
[1:31:23] dblinkerson: ask if he knows that it’s a grievous dot
[1:31:36] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[1:51:38] kelly_mac06: what mog is that you're wearing Jdotb
[1:51:44] trbotubbo: Any tips on healing Iridikron as Druid? It just feels like I dont have enough burst healing when we all have to soak the circle
[1:52:01] kelly_mac06: hmm it looks pretty sleek, i like it
[1:55:26] HolyFluvia: why did you press meld at first throns when sp was the target?
[1:55:43] HolyFluvia: ah kk
[1:56:01] Imorteus: they literally just need to show whos targeted 2 seconds before. womp womp
[1:56:13] Whitewolf1441: wait you got the mount?
[1:57:16] Basilwheat: jb are u experiecing any world lag atm? monkaHmm
[2:03:24] HolyFluvia: u play crit phial most of the time even in skip runs. do u just gamble during stealth that u wont get out of stealth through phial debuff? or how do u manage this?
[2:04:07] HolyFluvia: aighty :D
[2:05:19] zeniath1: just joined, what'd he respond to ^ -   =)

[2:42:43] edde15926: I laughed so much when i found out that the reason he sometimes grabs from really far is because you jump
[2:43:13] HolyFluvia: how can u meld pursuit for anybody else?
[2:43:46] nixar1: @HolyFluvia you just meld and pursuit stops, even if you're not a target
[2:43:46] seacombe: @HolyFluvia if anyone melds then he stops pursuit no matter who its on. its weird
[2:44:00] HolyFluvia: ah aighty ty all
[2:45:51] TBouse: Right side holy
[2:45:54] Whitewolf1441: @seacombe oh what, thats really weird
[2:46:22] Whitewolf1441: rezan is coded incredibly strangely in more than one way, like how he just pauses for no reason sometimes
[2:46:32] Whitewolf1441: just stands there

[2:59:40] sheenayy: @Akahashy lack of kicks
[2:59:50] sheenayy: spriest and druid
[3:00:14] Akahashy: @sheenayy yeah it's what I'm thinking since I have the same comp with my friend and we tend to get fucked going left
[3:01:55] sheenayy: yes timer is free so it doesnt matter
[3:01:57] sheenayy: what u do this dung
[3:01:59] sheenayy: just live
[3:03:55] ritsrawr: dude i dont understand how 3400 io people dont understand boss mechanics
[3:04:31] Whitewolf1441: this fight is a nightmare
[3:04:43] drumminbacon: @ritsrawr io is fake.
[3:04:46] Clush___: @ritsrawr higher io doesnt mean you're better it just means you're better at networking and you play more, with a touch of skill
[3:04:47] Clush___: lol
[3:05:25] drumminbacon: you just have to have someone carry you through a total of 16 dungeons all season and you can have higher io than most
[3:07:45] squirebdd: Jdotmadge
[3:07:46] sheenayy: DONT YELL GET BETTER
[3:07:48] RayeAerinae: hey chat, what's the commands for his weak auras?
[3:07:51] Gnolde: when I saw the team "Bald Bandits" for next week, I got really exited that you found a team...imagine my disappointment, when I found out who was not on it... Sadge
[3:08:04] progonitelj: why you didn't used heart ?
[3:08:05] lavacaestaenfuego: !wa
[3:08:09] AvalenaTV: RAGEY = weak aura (no space)
[3:09:00] sheenayy: NICE TRY wracking pains rtight after soulrend is crazy
[3:09:05] nightst314: bad timer overlap
[3:09:08] frejaclueless: It can be delayed if someone invises the cast or something
[3:09:10] AIeksiaa: nelf or mage invis
[3:09:18] xteintv: Good change blizz. Make it uninterruptable and a good almost 1 shot mechanic.
[3:09:20] nightst314: probably intended as a soft enrage
[3:09:20] bleeppblorpp: it's because they made it unkickable and didn't change queueing
[3:09:21] Fel_33: People melding/invising casts
[3:09:25] Mattyuh: that ruined my 30 last night
[3:09:25] shortsniperxbt: yeah it's like 3 4 sec delay usually
[3:09:32] sheenayy: are u sure as the fight goes on they dont get closer?
[3:09:44] Ditysalad: soulrend is a 30 second timer
[3:09:47] MicHawkh: obiously some1 did and dont want to admitt it lmao
[3:09:49] sheenayy: so longer the fight the more often that wil happen
[3:10:09] or3g: dude this boss is ass
[3:10:14] or3g: straight cheeks
[3:10:34] frejaclueless: real
[3:10:42] frejaclueless: I'd rather do TOTT than AD such a shit endboss
[3:10:56] TBouse: Is there any reason to not swap to leaf for this fight?
[3:10:59] RayeAerinae: KEKW
[3:11:05] or3g: i cant believe their solution to adding difficulty to this dungeon was to make wracking pain unkickable
[3:11:09] or3g: soooo fucking troll
[3:11:15] Mattyuh: i dont want to do AD anymore because people keep going ohh pretty spiders and trying to pet them
[3:11:19] Lara_TV_: @Ditysalad it's 40s
[3:11:43] TBouse: No need for a dps trinket on this bos
[3:11:50] AvalenaTV: what talents does the spriest play?
[3:11:50] Lara_TV_: Yeah you have to MB like literally right before cast ends
[3:11:52] sigabr: is the only change from bfa AD is the wrecking pain not beeing interruptable? or they change something else
[3:11:54] shortsniperxbt: maybe -trash + honed instinct ?
[3:12:04] shortsniperxbt: for more defensives
[3:12:37] CrerisRs: @sigabr 1 honor guard in front of volkaal instead of 2 now, for instance. But just minor touches like that. Also saurids dont proc on-death affixes anymore
[3:12:59] TBouse: Should definitely play leaf on 31 tyran lol
[3:12:59] sigabr: no.. i mean on yazma encounter
[3:13:06] sigabr: the dg changed a bit..
[3:13:24] sigabr: only wreckingpain changed rite?
[3:13:26] CrerisRs: got you, afaik nothing other than wracking pain not being kickable anymore
[3:13:27] ren0m: Good morning
[3:13:38] sigabr: how can one little change cause so much harm :D
[3:13:45] ren0m: Will you complete the dungeon? I need to see how to properly do the spiders.
[3:13:46] sigabr: this cast hurts a lot
[3:13:51] RayeAerinae: !weakauras
[3:13:53] iamdrewonline: i lkie how echo popped the spiders so it was easier to move around
[3:13:55] CrerisRs: when the spell murders you it becomes a problem, ye
[3:13:59] REGENAROCKET: Another close ad :(
[3:14:09] RayeAerinae: what's the command for all of your weak auras @jdotb ?

[3:14:30] RayeAerinae: thank you
[3:14:35] ren0m: Not sure if they're all here

[3:17:58] RayeAerinae: KEKW
[3:18:09] Lara_TV_: There's def some variance with spell queuing, but looking at a recent vod of mine, there was never an instant wracking AFTER soulrend, but we did get one right BEFORE a soulrend
[3:20:37] TBouse: That was weird

[3:58:05] glaukopes: @whitewolfstarcraft it was a decent week--for a tyrannical week. but if you don't already know the affixes well enough to know which ones are better and worse, the only thing you really need to know is to avoid pushing on afflicted week

[4:10:20] catchmetwenty20: hey JB how does prot pala deal with gnarl root or oakheart? im hardstuck 26s
[4:10:40] Sokchoy: @Sokchoy counterpoint he just depletes a lot of keys
[4:10:46] ren0m: I felt a difference above 15. it wasn't huge, but still. Up to 15 it was super easy.
[4:10:50] SinstoneRelics: Ppl in 16-20 don’t do a lot of the mechanics that are required in 20+
[4:10:58] Lenietwitch: @catchmetwenty20 gnarlroot as in the raid ? D:
[4:11:22] Blisssi: may I see talents super fast?

[4:16:04] DoubleProGG: whatsup brothers and sisters. Hello together
[4:16:57] itachiikun33: is there a reason you think MDI should have a healer ?
[4:17:05] itachiikun33: i heard your take and im just curious
[4:18:07] turboer: is no healer mdi similar conceptually to multi-tank tgp
[4:18:13] ren0m: I guess it's like how bus drivers don't want self-driving busses to exist
[4:19:09] turboer: like when tgp key levels get so high you run multiple tank specs hypothetically
[4:19:51] brewtank: @jdotb when do you play tree? feels so strong to press

[4:34:32] Su1a: @ren0m Naowh
[4:34:35] theBroHam: Naowh and Dorki are the tanks
[4:34:39] Tape84: DORKI

[4:35:13] ren0m: Cheers
[4:35:15] Su1a: Zmok also tanking but now he plays on rpala

[4:36:09] ren0m: If that makes sense
[4:36:34] ren0m: Where you can ask for advice rather than spam KEKW in the chat
[4:37:47] theBroHam: Dorki
[4:37:53] Tharayel: Dorki is approachable and has a tendency to answer questions
[4:37:57] theBroHam: his chat is pretty good and won't flame you for asking for advice
[4:38:09] turboer: gg
[4:38:32] ren0m: Thank you

[4:51:43] turboer: someones vods are their own IP tho

[5:18:40] jannekvarnc: 10 & 20?

[5:19:44] theBroHam: @toastbam he did last week
[5:19:50] Sokchoy: leech is good bro grow up
[5:19:58] TBouse: leech is good because you literally dont have to heal yourself with self bloom meta
[5:20:05] TBouse: with no leech i think you still have to a bit

[5:27:09] FlasheeTv: isn't avoidance better than leech?
[5:27:42] Sokchoy: people let tertiaries brainwash them it doesnt matter
[5:28:09] FlasheeTv: Ah so i wasn't wrong getting leech on my rogue and not necessary avoidance
[5:28:40] Sokchoy: leech has less value on dps because they dont typically need healing then they are doing the most damage

[5:32:18] FlasheeTv: I liked healing a "lot" with leech on my rogue.. Even more with the passive that gives me 12% more leech D:
[5:32:40] HolyFluvia: and if you would have the access to more leech than avoidance would you choose leech?

[5:34:23] vickmantwo: I don't like anything below 10%
[5:34:25] HolyFluvia: aighty, ty for your opinion
[5:34:29] vickmantwo: It just makes the game x10 easier
[5:35:01] vickmantwo: It's usually 6-7% of mine
[5:35:17] vickmantwo: Just depends on key really
[5:37:02] Sokchoy: maybe because you have to actually heal on that fight
[5:37:08] vickmantwo: I have 12% though
[5:37:17] Lara_TV_: That's efficient healing right there
[5:37:50] clickermekk: what key do you have JB
[5:38:21] hunterzx: that quick depleto guy has mental fortitude lets goo

[5:40:44] devilhawk83: chrysLUL chrysLUL You will be ok on Bolstering week
[5:41:22] theBroHam: they didn't lie, they "released" the monitor, just not in any meaningful quantity
[5:41:30] ren0m: Maybe your wife is going to EU to get you the monitor
[5:41:44] Sokchoy: ye man instead of playing anything enjoyable with your boring old monitor you should totally pug some bolstering keys
[5:42:24] ren0m: kek
[5:44:31] devilhawk83: Look on the bright side as it is not like it was in BfA with Fortified, Bolstering Teeming and Beguiling together chrysLUL
[5:44:51] ren0m: BfA had four affixes?
[5:44:58] devilhawk83: yep
[5:45:20] Sokchoy: all the good dungeons were in bfa wym
[5:45:33] devilhawk83: Beguiling was ass with the Aszhara Emissaries
[5:46:29] Whitewolf1441: :(
[5:47:21] Whitewolf1441: i loved rot so much
[5:47:22] Sokchoy: BFA + WoD
[5:47:38] Whitewolf1441: you just listed all the dungeons xD
[5:47:43] devilhawk83: Tol Dagor
[5:47:54] clickermekk: i miss SL dungeons and wish we could run them again with current Talents
[5:47:58] devilhawk83: Shrine of the Storm was also ass
[5:48:07] FlasheeTv: Nah just fck tol dagoer, no matter the week
[5:48:11] Whitewolf1441: rot is really good
[5:48:35] devilhawk83: The bridge in Shrine was FailFish FailFish FailFish
[5:48:39] WingedChipmunk: @jdotb Sanguine in Tol was a fucking nightmare
[5:48:48] snse: i liked the dungeons mostly but hated s1/s3, except for boralus fuck that place
[5:48:48] Whitewolf1441: was siege the same for both ally and horde?
[5:49:10] devilhawk83: Ally had the RP in siege
[5:49:32] devilhawk83: So it was quicker to time keys if you were Horde
[5:49:57] Whitewolf1441: @devilhawk83 no way they didnt notice that what??
[5:50:23] Whitewolf1441: mdi has to come around before they make changes :(
[5:51:02] HolyFluvia: what RP was this? huge time loss?
[5:51:19] ren0m: Is there any news about M+ changes for the next expansion?
[5:51:28] gooseleee: is this NA downtime or why are there so few 30 pugs up?

[5:52:06] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[5:55:11] Guffels: the fact 20s are easy to pug is all I need\
[5:56:35] divinelightz: bro im coming over from being pvp player. im max xp 1500 arena now im 3.6k thanks for stream <3
[5:56:44] divinelightz: 3.6 rio sry
[5:56:52] ren0m: Besides endgame, WoW really needs to fix the levelling experience.
[5:58:22] Guffels: leveling gets fixed in war within. you will do full 1-70 in dragonflight instead of bfa
[5:58:24] Ok_Kingston: @ren0m literally who gives a shit it takes 2 hours 0-70
[5:58:59] Guffels: leveling is important for getting more players into the game. every game would die if 0 new players ever joined
[5:59:02] ren0m: Who? Everyone who wants to start playing the game.
[5:59:27] ren0m: I know several people who quit before hitting 70 because levelling is terrible.
[6:00:07] ren0m: It has no RP element to it and all is geared towards getting to max level as quickly as possible.
[6:00:09] Guffels: not really a wow problem though. all mmos struggle with how to get new players into the game
[6:00:42] Guffels: @ren0m idk if thats true. my wife loved the BFA story going through it the first time
[6:00:47] ren0m: I'm talking from my experience.
[6:01:16] Whitewolf1441: do you think the issues with m+ are just an extensions with issues in blizzard in general?
[6:01:29] nornh: m+ only talents
[6:01:40] Guffels: gotta take the time to read everything and watch the cutscenes. drustvar has some of the greatest zone stories in the game
[6:02:10] ren0m: J1mmy did a good video about it - Runescape player.
[6:02:16] ren0m: Well a video about his experience at least
[6:02:43] NeuroTheGamer: You're making me want to write a cover letter and send a resume to Blizz about the position lol
[6:04:12] Ok_Kingston: timers too long
[6:04:41] Guffels: so are you seeming to infer that they just don't know about these problems? because i think they just dont care to allocate the resources
[6:05:42] BoozyWizard: Somone who doesnt play M+
[6:05:48] BoozyWizard: They just see a bug list
[6:05:53] BoozyWizard: and go hey! thats easy!
[6:06:43] hunterzx: "what issues" - blizzard, probably
[6:07:09] NeuroTheGamer: @hunterzx Unironically, yes, if there isn't a dedicated person keeping a pulse on the system
[6:07:54] Guffels: i think maxs point about anything above 25 being the top 0.1% of the player base holds alot of water. they just cant allocate alot of resources to that level. now wether you should allocate based on player count or player hours played is a different discussion
[6:09:15] theBroHam: and with Microsoft in charge now, time=money
[6:09:26] NeuroTheGamer: @Guffels Generally speaking I think the changes that impact the top 1% (0.1% is like 28-29+s), would benefit or simply be irrelevant to the other 99%. It can at worst be unnoticeable and at best make a better experience for everyone
[6:09:35] jasonicusm4: Then they could focus more on encounter and mob designs
[6:09:43] Whitewolf1441: jb how do i get out of my comfort zone(15+) and go on to higher keys, im scared of bricking peoples keys
[6:09:49] Harper_n7: I would actually play more if they got rid of depletion
[6:10:03] Guffels: @Whitewolf1441 push your own key and brick that. nothing to be scared of
[6:10:30] Whitewolf1441: @Guffels ah good point
[6:10:36] NeuroTheGamer: For example, I watched a friend's +18 recently in ToTT and entire group was just  stacked up taking multiple shocks on lightning from first boss and not using defensives on 3rd boss flame shock. they didnt die from it...they dont even know what you need to do at a higher level

[6:12:38] NeuroTheGamer: fire takes today JB
[6:12:42] kazdeya338: Interestingly these are the same fears that I have in sending 24's... because well... I'm bad
[6:13:49] xXFlow29Xx: interesting point of vue
[6:14:11] NeuroTheGamer: @Whitewolf1441 bump!
[6:14:16] Raethus_WoW: is there a new strat where ppl don't soak diving strike on tyr?
[6:14:39] ren0m: I think that applies a lot more to healers, since you always feel guilty if someone dies
[6:14:42] ren0m: At least I did
[6:14:45] TheSiliconDon: I admittedly have put off giving tanking a shot because I don't want to risk bricking a key. Took me a while to even try healing.
[6:15:08] Tamis2Hamis: iridikron intensifies
[6:15:12] Guffels: @Guffels that's just not true. top 1% is all 25s. top 0.1% is all 27s. Some changes sure but balancing one shots doesn't even matter to top 1% players.
[6:15:15] Luxion333: im trying to get to the next level But dont know how to improve. Cant tell if Im doing something wrong
[6:15:24] xXFlow29Xx: lol i do it on 27 fall, oom on last phase wtf
[6:15:25] devilhawk83: Honestly I am like do not worry about deleting if we are doing my key but there are people in my groups that are like wtf are you talking about
[6:15:56] jasonicusm4: you missed the touchdown catch. -1 key level
[6:16:01] devilhawk83: yep, that is very truw
[6:16:06] Guffels: @Raethus_WoW yes if you have immunities you can 2 man each soak
[6:16:41] jemar33: my ignore list is full of people because of blizzard
[6:17:02] xXFlow29Xx: but maybe there will be more ppl playing bad because they don't have this pression of deplete
[6:17:07] Guffels: people would just start kicking the person who bricked the key. sounds toxic af
[6:17:24] NeuroTheGamer: Depletion also discourages running your own, reducing the number of groups avail. If you pull a 26 EB from GV and ur group bricks, you're likely not gonna run the 25 since it's not score and an obnoxious as hell key
[6:17:36] kazdeya338: Brother even running with my friends I will tilt after 2 depletes. Again, we aren't the best first season we've done 3100 but like the depletes still suck because it takes alot of time for us to learn. Also makes experimenting route changes more intimidating
[6:17:54] kazdeya338: and we only have like "group nights" 2x per week
[6:18:12] Guffels: i think the best reason to remove depletes is because it stifles creativity in routing
[6:18:37] Guffels: but idk how you prevent mdi style chain pulling the first room until you dont die
[6:18:51] Zircons: From Blizzard's perspective, depletes are probably the only thing that keeps people pushing throughout the season, otherwise push groups will probably max out
[6:18:53] Zircons: Dumb reason
[6:19:13] Whitewolf1441: 10 max
[6:19:14] Zircons: not many, which is why it's a dumb reason
[6:19:20] Nikorosu: so as a new player i start at " key 1 " ???? and i have to grind to key 30?
[6:19:24] misdota: top groups would never ever stop running even if they did reach that wall
[6:19:38] Guffels: @Nikorosu lol no you wont go past key 20 in your first season
[6:19:45] Lara_TV_: Those people will just move on to an alt comp
[6:19:50] Pandho: blizzard does not care that much about those groups
[6:19:56] Nikorosu: i see thanks
[6:20:07] Sokchoy: ok but is it push week
[6:20:16] hunterzx: yeah i enjoyed progging my first xx key. But now its easy, so i go higher. its not about the number on the website, its the satisfaction of the challenge
[6:20:32] misdota: just meet in the middle: give a player who times their key 3 options on the new key, and give rerollers 2 options on a new key
[6:21:04] hunterzx: they act as if players will want to spend all day in EB just because its possible
[6:21:06] Guffels: the more rerolls the less variety in keys done because blizzard balances so badly
[6:21:19] DogShitPaladin: yeah
[6:21:22] MangoMafioso: Yea my key depleted and now I don't want to touch it and have to hunt for groups
[6:21:33] DogShitPaladin: the push teams have such an advantage in this system too, only they can keep pushing their keys up
[6:21:35] MangoMafioso: Rise key, sucks
[6:22:17] MrCasual_: For me honestly its the fact that I usually play a class that people just dont "prefer" in their group people want the path of least resistance more often than not which is why the opt for "meta" classes waiting to find a group for 30-45 min at atime is a drag
[6:22:31] Lara_TV_: It also lessens the negative feeling of imbalanced dungeons, so they'd be helping themselves too
[6:22:39] xjacobtv: @MrCasual_ You have your own key to use though!
[6:23:25] MrCasual_: @xjacobtv True but in my exp when i make a group and do my due diligence and look em up and pick classes based on performance I still get tanks or healers that exp a single wipe and dip even when the key is still timeable
[6:23:49] Sokchoy: what if we had like "challenge modes" where there was a static difficulty and you could walk in whenever you wanted and run it faster
[6:24:13] xjacobtv: But the loot is irrelevant if you're doing 31 AD
[6:24:20] Guffels: blizzard doesnt reward infinately farmable content so it would either have a weekly lockout ot no loot
[6:24:30] Zircons: So just drop if it's depleted for the normies then?
[6:26:05] Guffels: so... sounds like they need a lockout system for keys. something like you can lock your key level and dungeon with an npc option. idk what the downside would be in that system though
[6:26:09] MangoMafioso: At like 25+ you should just be able to do anything, because you're clearly far beyond the "loot farming" stage
[6:27:25] viinlox: No depletion would help out the pugging situation as well. Giving the group an opportunity to try again after a bad pull or bad play would help pugs stay together for multiple runs imo.
[6:28:03] MangoMafioso: Yep there's a handful of my friends I just can't play with for that very reason
[6:29:32] ren0m: It would be neat to see M+ battles where two teams race a dungeon.
[6:29:35] ren0m: Like in MDI
[6:29:49] throwmasterlol: is it an acutal comp or?
[6:30:08] kelly_mac06: Remember back near the beginning of Legion when your key would be bricked if you ran and didn't time it? You had to time it on that same level to "unbrick" it
[6:30:23] throwmasterlol: oh thats a strange comp
[6:30:24] jemar33: what WA shows you their specs?
[6:30:27] Zircons: definitely a bit of a meme comp for one thing
[6:30:31] jdotb: !wt
[6:30:33] jdotb: !wt 󠀀
[6:30:35] DogShitPaladin: Double rogue + X is just a real comp atm
[6:30:38] jdotb: !wt
[6:30:42] chaigy: Hi kelly jdotbHypers
[6:30:44] jdotb: !wt 󠀀
[6:30:46] chaigy: !windtools
[6:30:48] jdotb: windtoolks
[6:30:49] chaigy: monkaHmm
[6:30:50] jdotb: windtools
[6:30:53] Zircons: just maxing rogue damage
[6:30:54] kelly_mac06: @chaigy hi there friend!
[6:30:59] jemar33: thanks!
[6:31:00] Guffels: it was fury
[6:31:02] DogShitPaladin: Rogues dont benefit from lust much
[6:31:19] DogShitPaladin: it lets you keep consistent and not have big CD windows
[6:31:19] kelly_mac06: yea
[6:31:31] kelly_mac06: but something like that NOW would be good
[6:31:49] throwmasterlol: im not familliar with it, but what makes that comp viable? is it just that they are immortal?
[6:32:10] Whitewolf1441: im spamming rise for mount :D
[6:32:12] kelly_mac06: would be interesting to see them bring it back, i haven't run a key for loot since December
[6:32:21] kelly_mac06: so like im doing it for vault and crests lol
[6:32:37] DogShitPaladin: wdym I'm farming Leech/Avoidance pieces constantly
[6:32:38] Guffels: i actually really like that downside. the deplete would have to remove crests prod though
[6:32:42] kelly_mac06: @Whitewolf1441 lol yea i got Midnight's Reins and was like OH cool lol
[6:33:02] MangoMafioso: And please for the love of god, increase how much gold drops in the chest at higher keys. Now it literally costs money to farm keys.

[6:46:43] theBroHam: did anyone catch what happened to Dratnos' tooth?
[6:47:03] Guffels: @theBroHam rotted out when he was a kid. broke when he was eating bread recently
[6:47:13] theBroHam: poor guy
[6:47:15] theBroHam: ty
[6:48:29] Guffels: ya know, 3 of the 4 shadowlands seasonals I would pop off if they ever came back

[6:52:13] Guffels: !mdi
[6:52:22] Guffels: @pichuux no team
[6:52:38] dorki: we had a sub 12 of thnis dungeon but never pulled it off in matches
[6:53:02] dorki: or 13 or somethin
[6:54:26] gevoratz: I missed some shadowlands dungeons
[6:54:32] wowskyro: do you play on eu?
[6:54:33] smoothlol: wow dorki awake at this time
[6:54:55] jesustakethewheels: Dorki and Growl said why is JB always so angry about healer on Twitter lol
[6:55:19] smoothlol: if you ain't tweakin you ain't healin
[6:55:24] wowskyro: which m+ culture do you prefer na or eu?
[6:55:44] monntuu: i want JB back in MDI
[6:56:10] gevoratz: Talk to your hand
[6:57:01] jesustakethewheels: so is it for clout?
[6:57:34] DogShitPaladin: average turk follower
[6:57:36] baekel12345: being negative and complaining is easier then have a positive mindset, i guess
[6:59:26] baekel12345: i think its the way you provide feedback is what people set off
[6:59:39] flawlesslykun: everytime i hear this argument that you have shitty takes jb, i always laugh cause i remember 90% of this playerbase holds bloodlust in mythic plus for bosses "BeCaUsE ItS TyRaNnIcAl"
[6:59:46] flawlesslykun: then i remember they are retarded so i laugh
[7:00:30] Guffels: haha wow thats a clip
[7:00:51] baekel12345: its also the fact that how people interpret what they read
[7:01:51] simplepathwow: no arguing just talk behind ppls back
[7:02:18] jesustakethewheels: people just think you get upset very easily over small things
[7:02:20] baekel12345: its nothing personal i guess what u mean?
[7:02:31] KinarPT: hey JB evening. All good?
[7:02:34] KinarPT: Hey chat!
[7:02:47] baekel12345: ur fine m8 ;)
[7:03:19] KinarPT: Comes with age JB, we boil faster
[7:03:27] Whitewolf1441: i think getting upset at any sort of discussion is a sign of emotional immaturity
[7:03:42] baekel12345: people take alot of shit personal; that they read
[7:03:51] gevoratz: Have you thought about making a website for healer guides or do you have one ?
[7:04:07] speels414: that was me until i actually started watching you lol. used to always see ur tweets
[7:04:09] FuruF: But the 5 DPS comp really makes you lose your mind Kappa
[7:04:26] speels414: now im mad i didnt tune in sooner
[7:04:46] jesustakethewheels: it just seemed like you are very over-animated on twitter
[7:04:54] kelly_mac06: LOL the twitter persona is BIS tbh
[7:05:31] gevoratz: Do you play other games ?
[7:06:44] Rou_Gaming: Hey there, I saw you had your nameplate of fyrakk at the bottom rather than on top of him, is it possible to get that set up just for raid bosses, or do you have that everywhere?
[7:06:50] kelly_mac06: lol but you're actually not like that
[7:06:53] kelly_mac06: it's funny
[7:06:53] jesustakethewheels: There is a reason why a lot of people have that reaction no?
[7:07:25] kelly_mac06: taking you seriously on twitter is as dangerous as taking Fleks seriously on twitter
[7:07:28] kelly_mac06: you just can't do it
[7:08:09] theBroHam: @Rou_Gaming it's for all content
[7:08:16] theBroHam: !base
[7:09:19] gevoratz: Have you ever had a real difference with a player?
[7:09:26] gevoratz: About different opinions?
[7:09:35] kelly_mac06: LOL
[7:09:39] kelly_mac06: Dextus
[7:10:13] gevoratz: Like creating a conflict
[7:10:28] kelly_mac06: @jdotb did you see the question above about the nameplates? it was from Rou_Gaming
[7:10:53] theBroHam: I tried giving the command but SE isn't working again @kelly_mac06
[7:11:07] moistbuddha2: I think a lot of things said online  get misconstrued easily and are given tone that isnt intended with it. Like I send emails for work and people think im being an ass when it wasnt my intention at all. I guess my wording is poor. idk if this relates to your tweets/opinions as well
[7:11:10] Rou_Gaming: It‘s ok, I didn’t mean to ignore his talk,
[7:11:35] Rou_Gaming: I will ask at a better time
[7:12:25] jdotb: !base
[7:12:28] jdotb: !base 󠀀
[7:12:30] jdotb: !base
[7:12:53] jesustakethewheels: Has a player from MDI ever fight with you before
[7:12:54] kelly_mac06: @theBroHam aw, it's being a pain in the ass today. Thank you for trying to help!
[7:13:07] Pandho: with plater you can also just check an option
[7:13:30] Rou_Gaming: Thanks! I think I can make a weakaura that runs command base in raid and the other in dungeons
[7:13:53] Zircons: Serennia stole my ipod
[7:14:02] jesustakethewheels: What happened?
[7:14:31] jhand1es: hey jb do u feel your time within the comp space has come to an end at an elite level
[7:14:46] theBroHam: I'm off to a work meeting. Thanks for stream @jdotb Have a good day everyone
[7:15:26] jesustakethewheels: a few players just said you are too hyper focus on Resto druid DPS to the point of being unrealistic
[7:15:59] AliciaXuxuu: nerf jdotb asuna +2
[7:16:20] trivotix: I was not excited about the 4 dps. I hope they stop this in the future.
[7:17:06] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[7:21:08] L0kander: yo
[7:21:39] L0kander: is dk a beginner friendly class?
[7:21:41] DogShitPaladin: we should build off dr jays right route
[7:21:44] DogShitPaladin: and make one
[7:22:15] kelly_mac06: @L0kander not really tbh
[7:22:19] kelly_mac06: especially not BDK
[7:22:31] kelly_mac06: there is a lot of resource management for all 3 specs
[7:22:52] L0kander: @kelly_mac06 i see, was thinking of frost
[7:23:05] kelly_mac06: ISTG the most fun part of watching any Dr J team is seeing the crazy shit they are willing to try
[7:23:24] DogShitPaladin: they nerfed gorgers pretty hard so idk
[7:23:38] kelly_mac06: @kelly_mac06 frost isn't bad, im not a huge fan of the breath build but it's really strong.
[7:23:39] DogShitPaladin: 66% less melee damage
[7:25:52] L0kander: @kelly_mac06 was also thinking about a hunter, i feel like ranged would be easier idk
[7:26:37] gevoratz: Do you think for this season above 3.3 k is decent for an average player?
[7:26:42] kelly_mac06: @L0kander BM and MM hunter both very easy to learn (harder to fully master tho) and are super fun. They will not really be found in higher keys bc they don't bring anything to the group and can be squishy
[7:27:40] jasonicusm4: do warlocks only have 1 defensive?
[7:27:52] kelly_mac06: oh no
[7:28:01] nornh: debauchery time
[7:28:02] kelly_mac06: no shanna, chaos will ensue
[7:28:48] Whitewolf1441: TY JBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
[7:28:52] kelly_mac06: later man
