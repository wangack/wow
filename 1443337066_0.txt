[1:48:53] notominally: change 12% increase dmg to absorb conduit?, the dmg increase one can only proc once per game i believe also gives you an additional potency
[1:49:01] Pantteranova: Paladin is rough for rogs, they have too many defensives.
[1:49:28] imperius_z: washed
[1:49:30] radnod: mortal strike doesn't really matter against mage rogue
[1:49:33] ZerFunk: @pantteranova but you can kite them forever as rogue

[1:52:14] Lvladenpvp: I purged it insta
[1:52:25] notominally: consider [Ooz's Frictionless Coating], the one you have can only proc once per arena game
[1:52:29] corcontv: crushing blow is kinda like a mini charge
