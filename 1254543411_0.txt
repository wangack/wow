[4:08:18] JascerTV: Problem is Blizzard always listened to a loud minority of pro players that wanted a hardcore wow experience. Most casual to mid-professional players who actually kept the game alive have stopped playing.
[4:08:24] Astoriel_Erethas: i think it's great that raids are harder. but it's bad, the gear isn't that good if pvp gear is easy to become
[4:08:27] Ya7yaOG: ohh this is classic not tbc

[4:47:22] Faded_Funk: ffxiv*
[4:47:38] rainmakerwow: i'm near 99.99% sure that whole community people would rather have an active scene and a server, rather than a name no?
[4:47:40] naynayay: they explained some ppl enjoy smaller servers they gave a lot of good examples actually
[4:47:45] Robchew: I think it's legacy code reasons. Basically have to re-engineer it.

[13:22:43] probablewalrus: fully purging a mage is basically killing them with how long it takes to drink that mana back to buff again
[13:23:09] TheEndIsNear777: Frost mage best spec in pvp cus of shield, no interrupt and tanky. Remove that in 1 global and mage dies quick. Ambush rogues  make me only want to spec frost
[13:23:25] TheEndIsNear777: At least if you get purged in tbc as mage you can survive more
[13:23:35] rispincrispin: i think sham is pretty good vs mage, just spam shocks + grounding totem and purge goes a long way

[15:29:50] maffer777: People are doing pool party with level 1 characters to inflate the pool so he should be good

[15:30:36] GurtXD: i personally quit at lvl 20 this go round, i did all of classic already the first time and just couldnt make myself do it again, raiding classic is like another job
[15:30:49] Juerrilla: they should remove unique names and make your battletag the display, like diablo 3
[15:31:06] Juerrilla: and then run megaservers per region like ESO

[15:31:36] Dan5ku: yeah it was
[15:31:45] Justiino: Agreed. It should've been 100% on quest exp. Most disagreed
[15:31:49] rbubbaray: yeah after the hype reality sets in
[15:31:52] ridgidrex77: you put in the grind though didn’t ya mate
[15:31:57] warcraftbuddies: Blizzard knew it wouldn't last long or be worth the cost, so that's why they put mounts and character boosts etc to make up for it :D

[15:32:21] Rastolor: and if you spend time pvping when you are not 60 you aren't earning gold
[15:32:25] Kaldeem: I'm leveling a warlock. He's 34 feels like a good pace, but I'm only  doing green quests and grinding mob camps.
[15:32:32] GurtXD: i wonder what the average /played time for 1-60 was, i was about 6 days on my rogue during the first classic
[15:32:33] swedghost: 50 to60 is hard
[15:32:36] Justiino: I was indifferent on mob exp, but I would be fine with that. People wanted to see all of end game without stalling. At level 40, you feel the leveling again
[15:32:44] rbubbaray: yeah it is boring esp the pvp its only 3 bgs
[15:32:47] dudatron: for pvp they could try making a League of some sort just to PVP, no leveling just give all the gear one needs and go
[15:32:53] wisewinston1: no bc?
[15:32:57] jollap90: you look tired bro
[15:33:24] GurtXD: they shouldve increased overally exp rates not just quest rates
[15:33:25] Vunoka: 30-45 feels grindy,  the other lvls are fine imo
[15:33:29] chrissurreal_: i leveled to 60 and rerolled a 2nd toon to 60, the leveling isnt that bad imo
[15:33:33] GurtXD: overall*
