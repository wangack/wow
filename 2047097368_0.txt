[1:58:07] Sebleh: the funniest thing naguura is you can post the picture on Reddit and someone will find it for you
[1:58:11] abastus: Hello! Sometimes I accidentaly go into the wrong Eclipse. In those cases, shud I prioritize Wrath/Starfire based on the Eclipse or the amount of targets? Ex: fighting 3 targets, accidentaly go into Solar, do I Wrath or Starfire?

[1:59:30] cptdrage: i build bathrooms daily i have a few really cool tips
[1:59:42] Sebleh: @abastus if you’re in the wrong eclipse IE lunar on ST you cast wrath and solar on AoE you starfire
[1:59:45] africanleopard: use google
[1:59:51] Sebleh: solar on aoe you wrath* not starfire shit
[2:00:06] Sebleh: I did a bad Smadge
[2:00:11] Kleophea: Das Bild in google Rückwärtssuche eingeben
[2:00:46] emnitthy: @sebleh if you have 10 targets and you’re in solar you wrath? HUH
[2:00:51] Sebleh: those look way too colorful
[2:00:53] cptdrage: use a huge tile in the shover so its easy to have it clean and u can get em in super cool colors etc
[2:00:53] mentoku: is it textured or just a printed pattern on each tile?
[2:01:24] Sebleh: @emnitthy a lot of starfire bonuses only apply if you’re in lunar. make sure you read your talents YEP

[2:01:50] sim967: can you ask someone from the place you saw them?
[2:01:56] Kleophea: Aber in Rückwärstsuche sucht es auch ähnliche Bilder, vielleichtfindet google es ja in einem Shop
[2:02:09] emnitthy: @sebleh surely it’s a dps gain to apply waning to more targets and to hit all 10 targets over wrath’s astral power generation even in strong eclipse
[2:02:16] Sebleh: @zirconn__ Johnny does the graphics for the naguurafest stuff. maybe just let him handle it. naguuraSip

[2:05:28] emnitthy: @sebleh I mean on low target count I can see how wrath would be better, like up to 4/5, above that ?  sounds fishy

[2:19:32] R1ngberg: Oh that's very common around me too.
[2:19:37] yiannisjk: technically if it looks dirty then it makes you wanna shower more so
[2:19:39] Kahlandra: related, but naguura i need to redo my bathroom so once your done designing yours, can you design me please and thanks
[2:19:44] MadDuck010: guzuBonk guzuBonk guzuBonk guzuBonk guzuBonk
[2:19:44] JohnnyOneLung: that looks like they took a section of the wall from the original Saw movie
[2:19:54] Saltytyphoon: I’m Italian blown ass gL
[2:20:00] MarkElf2204: the tile on the left or the stone on the right that you were hovering over?
[2:20:00] Elembry_us: That shower would give me anxiety every time I look at it because I'd feel the need to constantly clean it
[2:20:01] Sebleh: @kahlandra yes she will design you. do you want her to do your bathroom too? naguuraGiggle
[2:20:21] Kahlandra: sure
[2:20:22] Kahlandra: lol
[2:20:24] cptdrage: yea but  its not the tile itself it is the use a different 1 piece huge one in shower
[2:20:25] Saltytyphoon: white rude

[2:21:06] Saltytyphoon: egg mom
[2:21:06] Kahlandra: i live in texas, our stereotypical style is the texas star, wood, guns. you can use that as a jump off point for my design
[2:21:07] cptdrage: yes ofc but dont think about the tile itself but what a huge tile can do
[2:21:21] populuxxe: Put a toilet in there.
[2:21:31] Saltytyphoon: window or not

[2:22:26] Kahlandra: @Sebleh good question, probably at least 4
[2:22:30] soloon60hzz: How are you flying (not dragonflight flying) in valdraken?

[2:23:24] Kahlandra: i like the tiles, not so much the sinks
[2:23:30] LesterOfSmeg2: like mostly counter a little dark
[2:23:31] Vendrek: I would hate to clean around the sinks
[2:23:32] fivaldrood: Sinks should be set into the counter not above it.
[2:23:33] Kahlandra: the shower inset is cool
[2:23:34] JohnnyOneLung: they just give you a sinking feeling I guess
[2:23:35] soloon60hzz: I like it
[2:23:36] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[2:23:39] tArnmaiin: always disliked raised sinks like that
[2:23:40] mogzter: too dark
[2:23:40] plsdontbanmemen: Looks cool
[2:23:41] Billo0w: everything is so grey :D
[2:23:43] MarkElf2204: It looks nice at first glance but not my cup of tea
[2:23:43] Deatheran: i actualy like it except for raised sinks, i rather them in the counter
[2:23:48] MadDuck010: looks amazing
[2:24:04] fivaldrood: @Deatheran This
[2:24:05] Elembry_us: lolol. I like the sinks. They are different
[2:24:12] ChaosRenown: sinks look like toilet pans in a retirement home
[2:24:14] Saltytyphoon: looks updated sad u
[2:24:15] Vendrek: Like it is refined and modern in appearance. but cleaning around the sink as well as the lighting is very dim
[2:24:18] TotallyNotRaien: too modern
[2:24:20] comrang: need more light color
[2:24:25] comrang: abit dark
[2:24:29] Elembry_us: @ChaosRenown You just ruined the sinks for me
[2:24:35] Sebleh: I don’t like that mine doesn’t look like that.
[2:24:35] MadDuck010: maybe lil too dark
[2:24:40] LesterOfSmeg2: only thing i not great for me counter to dark
[2:24:41] Billo0w: its that "millenial grey" everyone talks about :D
[2:24:41] Saltytyphoon: actually easier cleaning
[2:24:43] MadDuck010: but its amazing
[2:24:47] Vendrek: The storage could be extended to the floor for more space
[2:24:49] Kahlandra: i'm not a fan of sinks that are above the countertop line. i prefer them in the counter. other than that, i think its pretty sleek
[2:24:51] nairb1: square shower but oval mirror yuck
[2:24:55] Okizoo: the wood trim around the ceiling.
[2:24:56] angrykhoifish: Is that a rendering? Something about the lighting and shadows looks off, like it's really dark or something
[2:24:56] camulos9259: I live in Montana so I prefer more of a western old school theme.
[2:24:57] fivaldrood: The sinks is the only problem.
[2:24:57] accessdenn: why 2 sinks
[2:24:58] ItsUrBuddyJake: I like it but the plain wall to the left with the door is a bit out of place in this picture.
[2:24:59] Kahlandra: i ike the backlit mirrors and the light in the shower inlay
[2:25:05] MarkElf2204: Not a fan of the sinks, wood veneer at the top is odd, lack of base seems ood, mirrors are a bit odd/small
[2:25:11] Wildsil: the towel racks are badly placed, and where are the power outlets?
[2:25:11] sim967: would just have the sinks flush with cabinets
[2:25:14] cptdrage: i like it have used that one on a bathroom but what i didnt like was that when u had those walltiles on all walls it was to mutch oatteren all around but really nice when it was on just one wall
[2:25:19] Saltytyphoon: oval vs square vs circle
[2:25:21] Kahlandra: no that tile is too busy
[2:25:25] MadDuck010: muchhh betterrr
[2:25:26] Saltytyphoon: lol
[2:25:28] MarkElf2204: It's the same render
[2:25:32] LesterOfSmeg2: like that counter still to dark
[2:25:34] Elembry_us: Like the first one better. Those tiles are very busy
[2:25:35] neighbourovi: can we see them in paralel?
[2:25:35] ItsUrBuddyJake: Still plain wall to the left with the door
[2:25:38] Billo0w: now i like it
[2:25:39] Vendrek: Better well lit...easy to clean...still lacking storage
[2:25:39] comrang: better, but lose the oval mirror, rectangle one is better to match  the shower
[2:25:39] nairb1: looks like i will be too cold even under hot water
[2:25:40] Saltytyphoon: marble
[2:25:41] TotallyNotRaien: the bathroom looks like a creature
[2:25:42] fivaldrood: Sinks better, the marble looks dirty
[2:25:43] RippedSplitter: Sinks are better
[2:25:45] savagekato: the mirrors look like a pain to clean unless you're like 9 feet tall
[2:25:52] OdyssaQ: @kahlandra agreed. I like the lighter walls but not the pattern
[2:25:52] JohnnyOneLung: I think I'd hate that marble after a while
[2:25:55] MadDuck010: last one was too dark for me
[2:25:55] Sebleh: the tile could be limited to the shower and something else for the rest of the wall tbh. it’s def too much.
[2:26:05] Sebleh: marble* not tile yeah
[2:26:08] Saltytyphoon: mmm
[2:26:10] JohnnyOneLung: shower looks sick
[2:26:23] fivaldrood: Not enough shower heads
[2:26:27] cptdrage: those tiles u have to go pickout urself since they r different from one order to the next so see them in the store fisrt
[2:26:28] Blaknwyt: how much natural light is going into bathroom?
[2:26:31] sim967: I would have that sink counter top with the shower from previous photo

[2:47:06] Vendrek: Whenever we would do shift changes on the submarine we would go to sleep 12 hours ahead of time required to be up for working. That way with the tossing with not wanting to sleep you still got enough to function and slowly adjust to the knew schedule.
[2:47:20] rizuel23: Im lucky to be up by noon on the weekend but during the week I get up at 5am
[2:47:26] doon03: I’m at the age where I can’t wake@up@later than 7:30 :(

[2:52:43] Kahlandra: just have one of those panera lemonades
[2:52:54] JohnnyOneLung: black tea itself has more caffeine apparently... but you don't eat the leaves so it's much lower than coffee
[2:52:57] Sebleh: I stand corrected naguuraSip
[2:53:04] Waltherott: idk just get some caffeine free coffee or tea
[2:53:05] JohnnyOneLung: I think I remember hearing that on an episode of QI

[2:53:40] skotyven: does this chat look down on caffeine?
[2:53:46] camulos9259: drink one of those Bang energy drinks and you will want to run in a circle for an hour.   one of them has 300mg+ of caffeine

[3:08:57] poppapump: I’m sorry don’t ban me
[3:08:59] Draznath: in the US we only have pasteurized milk unless you know a dairy farmer or go to a special market
[3:09:02] AndreaBizz8: he means the condesed milk maybe to mix with normal milk?
[3:09:07] ShelviJ: i think it's Eisbock
[3:09:16] ShelviJ: used to make coffee

[3:09:39] JevyJ: 100% have you ever talked to a coffee person
[3:09:41] JevyJ: they love talking
[3:09:43] poppapump: ask them how to make the creamy chai latte
[3:09:43] Sebleh: you probably could call even
[3:09:44] Draznath: there are some nice oatmilk brands that get super creamy
[3:09:46] xVTechnique: maybe it’s just on the menu?
[3:09:50] poppapump: Dunkin’s has the best chai latte
[3:10:16] Voodoodippin: Dirty Chai is actually bis
[3:10:22] Ares_MT: Fat in milk takes the place of air when you froth, when frothing milk to get as many micro-bubbles as possible, you want a reduced fat content.  Unpasteurised milk has its fat content changed by high tempreatures which means that the micelles dont form as frequently, and the milk generates microbubbles more effectively.
[3:10:25] JohnnyOneLung: it's gonna be really sad when they reply with "oh we just add a lot of [really unhealthy thing]" LUL
[3:10:29] Herr_OJ: Maybe they tell you as part of "customer service" You can´t lose :D

[3:26:31] Sebleh: @yohobojoe_ssbm iirc the highest difficulty has the chance of the lower ones built into it. idk.
[3:26:32] Felbladez: killing him on heroic adds the axe dropchance from lfr and normal
[3:26:36] skeletonetiquette: Yoho just the highest difficulty you're comfortable with
[3:26:37] lightbringercl: @yohobojoe_ssbm In general, run Fyrakk at the highest difficulty you're able; the chance for the legendary rolls up the chances from the easier difficulties

[3:33:45] HeIIaAverage: Yeah that's kinda trolling not soothing that dragon lol
[3:33:54] ghenesis_: ethical gamer starsurging
[3:34:01] Sebleh: like the idea of Galakrond alone became too massive that they didn’t feel like they could live up to it
[3:34:26] Dreclador: best fight. Not Galakrond. Galadrond's poop
[3:34:27] Fausstty: Unless they make him super big like Old Gods where his entire spine is a zone

[5:35:41] naieisawful: how does fated raid work? just came back to wow , quit on sanctum
[5:36:03] rime_covered_mace: scaled raids from earlier in the xpac
[5:36:30] BouzsiTV: Player coming back to retail after 1 year off, spent playing Wrath Classic... What class should I play? And what's a good race combo for it?
[5:36:33] Draznath: @naieisawful every week rotates to a different DF raid, and there is essentially an "affix" for the raid bosses
[5:36:33] Sebleh: @naieisawful it’s the three dragon flight raids on rotation at current difficulty. one week raid 1, then raid 2, then raid 3, week four it starts over. halfway through the season all 3 raids are always open.
[5:36:49] Plasma_Shrimp: @BouzsiTV moonkin, any race bc chicken
[5:37:36] rime_covered_mace: theres really no need to min/max race/class in retail. i think rogue is still "meta" for melee?
[5:37:44] Sebleh: I like how you started this by disagreeing with me and talked yourself into the same thing I said naguuraSip

[5:38:16] Sebleh: numbers wise doesn’t matter, it’s just what plays best. and S2 pretty much plays better than S1
[5:38:22] rime_covered_mace: DH and fire mage are strong curently but it all shifts so just play what seems fun.
[5:38:28] rime_covered_mace: im doing aff lock for example. lol
[5:38:42] 2000ish: toe downgraded his already bad microphone :d
[5:38:48] ppOverheater: fak man i have u on my 85 inch tv on speakers and my neighbours heard that
[5:38:51] Faramonde: he doesnt know how to configure it.. or his voice is low quality idk
[5:39:10] Stricken79: good morning naguuraHET
[5:39:28] Sebleh: it will seblehHmm
[5:39:29] Kinraeel: @Sebleh Have you tried playing alts? Kapp
[5:39:45] Sebleh: @kinraeel I’m actually on the “other games” route
[5:39:53] Kinraeel: oh
[5:40:05] Faramonde: he just needs to turn down the gain.. its distorting like hell
[5:40:05] Sebleh: I met him irl too and can confirm what she’s saying YEP
[5:40:09] Kinraeel: i have 3 different alts on 486ilvl+ rn
[5:40:09] DonMorow: lol teamspeak
[5:40:10] Kinraeel: kek
[5:40:15] DonMorow: teamspeak < vent
[5:40:42] Kinraeel: @DonMorow it's still used, discord can take a lots of shit
[5:41:08] rime_covered_mace: im sure there is somebody out there that uses it lol
[5:41:36] Kinraeel: most RWF guilds
[5:41:38] Kinraeel: yeah
[5:41:39] DonMorow: @Kinraeel i guess teamspeak can me more computationally efficient
[5:41:43] Stricken79: 5 more days of 6am split shifts and I am free naguuraClap
[5:41:47] DonMorow: can be*
[5:42:17] Kinraeel: and discord doesn't take that much toll on PC
[5:42:22] Kinraeel: i mean teamspeak ^
[5:42:34] Ironhide433: True
[5:42:37] naieisawful: rip the discord sponser
[5:42:49] Sebleh: discord is pretty bad when you have a lot of people in a voice channel
[5:42:54] valpuri: probably because TS is specialized in voice, Discord spreads it's effort on voice, video, messages, etc
[5:43:08] naieisawful: i love teamspeak whisper thingy

[5:45:52] Draznath: im gonna start requiring team speak for my m+ groups Kappa
[5:45:55] rime_covered_mace: its not bad. lol
[5:45:58] OfMikeAndMen: @Geysi82 the voice codec they use is just worse
[5:46:10] JessieeJoness: in dutch its called Deekie :P
[5:46:15] OfMikeAndMen: it used to be even worse still, its alright now
[5:46:16] bigtilter: I have worn my oodie to tescos
[5:46:25] domax92: teamspeak on voice is a bit better but really no one cares except for top 3 guilds in the world
[5:46:25] naieisawful: its genious
[5:46:34] Sebleh: you don’t want that tho
[5:46:36] niatube: i have the same oodie as you with the bunnies!  love it
[5:46:37] WeaselMuffin: @bigtilter yeah but you also tesco at 4 am so you fit right in

[5:46:51] Faramonde: @bigtilter yeah but you also tesco at 4 am so you fit right in
[5:46:57] Sebleh: their sponsorships are a free oodie, a small flat fee, and they get rights to your image wearing it for free advertisement

[5:47:32] TooMuchVodkaa: if you have multiple people speaking at once, isn't there a bigger issue?
[5:47:39] Draznath: omg their are pokemon oodies Pog
[5:47:56] Sebleh: discord also does this thing where some people randomly get priority and someone gets lowered automatically

[5:48:33] rime_covered_mace: RTFM
[5:48:42] OfMikeAndMen: @naieisawful discord has priority push to talk also
[5:48:48] Gatmayn: chicken with day moves
[5:49:12] 2000ish: according to market research, the solution to fix discord is, suprisingly, to ban sebleh naguuraNotes
[5:49:33] naieisawful: which raid comes back during faided season? i just came back so i missed crucible, and it has KILLER cloth looks
[5:49:38] Sebleh: @2000ish god I wish it were so seblehCope
[5:49:49] 2000ish: @Sebleh naguuraGiggle
[5:49:54] valpuri: having it for things like halondrus bomb pairs is also nice
[5:49:59] skeeld: its also a higher level of skill asked of players though to remember push to talk keybinds for all their different subgroups
[5:50:06] chaarp: true, no one want's to hear the healers. should be seen, but not heard
[5:50:17] Geysi82: healer chat must be the worst thing to hear lol
[5:50:19] r3conops: I really wish Discord had the whisper voicechat capability
[5:50:21] naieisawful: yea, separate groups and using whisper for the whole team is super efficient it also makes more fun in my opinion, cuz every1 wont have to be sillent 24/7 cuz coms all the time
[5:50:58] valpuri: and then you have the person who trashtalks with a friend on whispers press the wrong keybing LUL
[5:51:00] 2000ish: tbh i don't need teamspeak, i just need new ears lolol, i just don't hear well lolol

[6:55:12] nordyt: @Sebleh you have a clue how S4 Fated will be less difficult then playing the raids while there active
[6:55:13] ICTechnology: Technically you could if your diet was giving you a calorie deficit every day

[6:55:41] yohobojoe_ssbm: anyone know a good way to farm flightstones?
[6:55:45] wishfulalex: is starfall good here?
[6:55:54] Sebleh: @nordyt if it’s like shadowlands then it’s gonna be way too easy and not considered prog for most guilds unless they’re hitting new bosses they didn’t kill while they we’re live

[7:09:42] emnitthy: @darkevietv feral is super comfy on tindral, literally 0 mechanics

[7:10:09] onehitrr: @Sebleh fingers.
[7:10:11] marou19: @Sebleh with what ustensile I have

[7:10:57] camulos9259: Feral and Balance are super close to eachother.   It's all player skill
[7:11:01] emnitthy: the feral / boomy difference is not dps, its survivability and melee restrictions

[8:14:56] Sebleh: Friday dinner is a given but no Invincible? naguuraSip
[8:15:38] Faramonde: I think its never worth pressing starfall.. I think pressing mushroom gives more burst and generates more resource for it to be better ST anyways
[8:15:42] Faramonde: I think thats the logic

[8:20:10] Sebleh: I heard you get one free action from the feather but idk how this fight works
[8:20:15] astreinoid: if you mount up, immediatly fly off and press surge as fast as possible yes
[8:20:20] Faramonde: if you drive into orbs you lose dragon juice
[8:20:30] wishfulalex: they nerfed flying free swirling after the nerf.
[8:20:35] astreinoid: if you do not take off immediately it does not work
[8:21:18] wishfulalex: it came with the seed nerf
[8:21:27] astreinoid: this actually works in the open world as well. mount up+ take off + surge in one

[8:34:27] Faramonde: this boss is great... for melee at least
[8:34:43] criptos: No, this boss is trash. even as melee it's not fun at all

[8:35:47] Sebleh: you’re the boss here naguura you decide naguuraSip
[8:35:54] Sebleh: could do cooking into promotion
[8:36:02] Sebleh: or cooking into wow into promotion
[8:36:30] Sebleh: or best solution cooking into The Invincible into promotion feenBrain I solved it for you
[8:36:48] TiPera: the fps killed u there
[8:36:49] TiPera: sadly
[8:36:56] Bigvont: what was this slide show? :D

[8:37:17] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[8:37:22] TiPera: try disabling the shadows
[8:37:30] TiPera: maybe it helps
[8:37:35] Faraday5001: turning off details helps my fps on this fight a huge amount
[8:37:51] Sebleh: yeah put settings down and details parse rate much slower I’d say naguuraSip
[8:38:28] Sebleh: there’s also that thing about some scale rate needs to be set to 1.0 because we set it to 0.99 in season 1?
[8:38:38] molo316: EZ
[8:38:44] Sebleh: true

[8:39:38] kovakenai: @Faraday5001 to me turning off Raider Io always helps
[8:39:42] Sebleh: so Naowh tweeted I’m S1 that there was some setting you could change to 0.99 for performance improvement and jb tweeted that apparently that change breaks performance in tindral this season and you have to set it back to 1.0
[8:39:48] Sebleh: in S1*

[8:43:41] Kuroz: I don't think you changed it
[8:43:53] Sebleh: render scale is a setting. you have to set it to 100% if you changed that before.
[8:43:53] Kuroz: you didn't even apply the naowh fix in the first place

[8:44:10] kn0c_ez: you want renderscale 75%
[8:44:31] Kuroz: it was correct from the beginning cause you never touched it
[8:44:34] Sebleh: if you have it at 100% then you’re good.
[8:44:44] Kuroz: keep it at 100
[8:44:54] lycantropphe: raid and BG set to lower ..
[8:44:56] Sebleh: yeah. I had mine at 99% and when I moved it to 100% I started getting consistent 30-40 fps in to deal
[8:45:25] Sebleh: but yeah this came up because a lot of people changed it in S1 to fix the same issue
[8:45:40] TiPera: disabling shadows might help a lot
[8:45:49] TiPera: maybe try it for one pull and see if it works for you
[8:45:51] Sebleh: because they want money from you
