[2:47:52] ronny_84: there are some side effects to that though. Im researching it myself
[2:48:00] Quackthyr: ozempic is more for a1c control. Mounjaro is the banger for weight loss

[2:49:25] alantin77: it fills the receptors in your brain that makes you feel hungery
[2:49:31] obbi87: @Towelliee Wegovy is for people without diabetes. But its amazing, i dont feel hunger as before. The feeeling for fastfood and candy is 100% gone. The side effect many get, are INSANE dreams . I have them, i think its fun, others not :P

[2:50:41] CeruleanStar: nicotine actually suppresses grelin production lol
