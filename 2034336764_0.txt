[0:22:09] Cirdan200: I am excited for the follower dungeons I can learn how to tank that way I've always been DPS and Healer.
[0:22:19] cabeshpash: I hope they add follower dungeons to all of the old raids, I never got a chance to do a lot of that content and no one runs it really

[0:26:04] HSAyril: I really wish they'd add more cosmetic stuff to M+. Specifically reactive cosmetic stuff since they only did it once in MoP. Maybe a special tier tint at 1,500, weapon tint at 2,000, and special reactive armor and weapon at 2,500
[0:26:19] Atomicpanda: all i got left of loremaster is icecrown and... vash'ir. so, yeah, never getting it done.

[0:27:23] Trebled_Mind: hoodie + profit = sex? that’s just good business.
[0:27:32] Lenitas: Mythic plus should have definitely gotten dragonriding mounts this expansion rather than the lizard
[0:27:37] Blakimas: That would be great, cosmetic wise. Each class? Or each armor type?
[0:27:47] HSAyril: Oh man, I'm only 500 rating from 2,500

[0:42:33] Phenroi: Do we know what happened to the heart at the end of SoO?
[0:42:35] Nulgar: @elrathir I feared that tneKhadgarWut
[0:42:38] Farmoure: Wasnt one of the scenarios literally called dark heart in pandaria?
[0:42:45] AssumptionPrime: Void-Touched gear
[0:42:46] ArcaneSyntax: void touched
[0:43:11] Nulgar: @farmoure yeah, revolved around the digging up of that heart
[0:43:15] MeggoArt: I have mixed feelings about this because if she's collecting the old god essences (or whatever) i don't want her to eat them (or something) and replace them entirely
[0:43:20] kyrostrasz: in all fairness is SoD considered canon
[0:43:37] kyrostrasz: oh ok literslly answered as I typed thanks lol
[0:43:41] WolfJoke: i think they said it was not time travel

[0:44:25] ArcaneSyntax: she has a dagger
[0:44:34] viirracocha: and her dagger
[0:44:35] desmoslee: I just assumed SoD was a "seasonal" ARPG type mechanic like Season of Mastery was
[0:44:35] Nulgar: @jmalmin check out Sylvanas in Classic
[0:44:35] goldengrubate: haha zombie old god raid where we take them all down again one after the other
[0:44:36] Alonarius: You think they're doing this to get classic players into retail?
[0:44:37] theszoti: who else would she be?
[0:44:39] desmoslee: just on like a 2 year timer
[0:44:42] jumzo: if they pull this off it will be so so cool
[0:44:43] WolfJoke: it might be previous holders of the dagger
[0:44:46] Hippwn: whos quest is she a part of that looks like a warlock?
[0:44:54] astralumi: blizz is limited to using Classic models. don't get too hung up on model details, chat

[0:46:27] jmalmin: She was locked away in the dagger during this time. So she is time travelling.
[0:46:27] dright424: Maybe she is going to use their essences to open a gate for the Void lords to enter our reality
[0:46:33] AwesomeSalsa: Didn't she get that body in BFA? So it would have to be time travel
[0:46:39] placeholdername33: placeholdername33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months!

[1:01:41] fat_european0: Grimrail was fun
[1:01:45] JMan31337: rdfg and have the mod keys assigned to my mouse
[1:01:48] DylanTheBard: I think next season will just be all dragonflight dungeons
[1:01:49] kikisume: grimrail was fun imo
[1:01:49] HSAyril: I use the Orbweaver, but I always use the same buttons for certain things like interrupt and defenses as well
[1:01:50] fen_bear: I LOVED grimrail!
[1:01:55] AlanC2024: ???
[1:01:56] yifors: i hated grimrail
[1:02:05] lilysteel29: im gona do the the war within beta too so i used 90 on the game @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:02:06] AlanC2024: the idiots
[1:02:13] fen_bear: ??? the fuck
[1:02:14] AstroCaptain: That's a terrible take lol. Dawn of the infinites is fun
[1:02:17] Lenitas: Dawn is really solid
[1:02:17] mewpoke_: i understand the issues people have with the 2nd half in m+ but the 1st half is great
[1:02:17] jumzo: Imagine having an opinion that wrong, that dungeon rocks
[1:02:17] wanik90: rise is great, fall has issues
[1:02:19] fen_bear: I love that dungeon
[1:02:21] alextheblight: must have done very few mythics
[1:02:28] Greyzag: DOTI is great with friends terrible with PuGs
[1:02:29] JarDorK: its because people dislike the last boss because they dont know the mechanics
[1:02:30] SisterblissUK: that second hour glass boss i hate lol
[1:02:34] jumzo: I'll say they are wrong and bad on your behalf
[1:02:34] Sheckly84: Fall is fine, Rise has it's issues
[1:02:38] kikisume: I saw that LOL! people complaining about the walking/rp-ing of dawn
[1:02:38] DiscordianKitty: the rp is painful
[1:02:41] Lenitas: Like there's some issues with them obv, but they're really good still
[1:02:50] Karvenboom: I play tank, so one of my side buttons is taunt, and the other is tab target
[1:02:51] fat_european0: Galakrond's Fall is one of my favourite dungeons
[1:02:53] Ghworg77: I don't like rise, but it's far from the worst ever
[1:02:59] AlanC2024: less than what it was
[1:03:00] Lenitas: Def better than ToTT this season
[1:03:00] Hounded1111: you say you are trash at M+ only because you have never grouped with me.
[1:03:01] Arlaeya: fun with people you know, TERRIBLE with pugs
[1:03:02] rhaegoplayz: People will enjoy what they enjoy it's a game if they like it great, if not that's fine too. People need to stop thinking their opinion is the only one that matters. lol
[1:03:03] DylanTheBard: may have been in a few bad pugs, dawn of the infinites slaps
[1:03:06] HSAyril: I'm glad they kept the gauntlet of resetting
[1:03:11] Atomicpanda: happy patch day. i feel so broken, i hope we're gonna be ok. happy patch day. when nothing's working all i want to do is play. tneDorkthyr
[1:03:12] DiscordianKitty: oh right you're a priest, you walk slow
[1:03:14] Deralis: never been bothered by the RP, just means i can blow some cooldowns on trash tbh LUL
[1:03:15] Karvenboom: I hate time janitor but in rise
[1:03:20] Karvenboom: Bit
[1:03:20] mewpoke_: that's CRAZY
[1:03:22] MeggoArt: middle mouse button class speed boost

[1:03:44] yifors: did you just say W?
[1:03:47] AdaMattium_: What do you move with?
[1:03:57] AlanC2024: mouse wheel click is usually my targeting circle like flamestike or barrier
[1:04:05] TaliesinAndEvitel: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:04:14] thunduz: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco
[1:04:18] Atomicpanda: all my abilities are on my left mouse button.
[1:04:24] MC_WhiteNoiz: I have shit scroll wheel up as pet attack and down for return, like a yo-yo
[1:04:30] MC_WhiteNoiz: shift8
[1:04:34] stevsal89: pgeNom
[1:04:41] Elrathir: by the way, I saw you guys put a picture of Sylvanas grinning over Liam's grave in the beginning of this week's weekly reset. I feel both "How could you?" and "Lmao" about this choice tneKhadgarWut tneEvi
[1:04:52] Atomicpanda: i'm a clicker
[1:04:58] Noznatation: shots fired
[1:04:59] HSAyril: I have the notification for that on my phone, I was going to watch it, then T&E Live twitch notification came up
[1:05:01] Saevash: tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:05:09] TojaxEK: scroll wheel = filler (frostbolt as mage) / lightning bolt as Ele sham
[1:05:10] Sorin__: Ive missed listening to these lovely streams for the end of my work day
[1:05:15] zebercetanayurt: i mean i click 2-3 things tbh
[1:05:19] DylanTheBard: all my abilities are on my mouse buttons, mmo mice are the best
[1:05:24] NotIeni: Honestly always so happy to see you stream, even (especially?) when you dont even play WoW, just talk things
[1:05:27] Mantrakore: scroll wheel for interrupt is the quickest for me and arguably the most important ability to pull off quickly.
[1:05:28] seanstrachan: @atomicpanda me too!!!
[1:05:39] Atomicpanda: @seanstrachan i thought i was the only one.
[1:06:02] HSAyril: VOID GALAKROND
[1:06:23] Deralis: i think its cool as hell
[1:06:33] Saevash: so classic is canon!
[1:06:38] Teth33: I think you should have the spongebob "1 hour later" graphic on queue anytime you try to talk about a topic. Chat always sidetracks the convo and you have to go back.
[1:06:39] Atomicpanda: i've really tried not to be a clicker but just can't. ah well, it's never held me back.
[1:06:54] MeggoArt: i hope we get a novel or comic or 2.5 animation or something with her POV !
[1:06:56] Nulgar: @teth33 tneEvi
[1:07:04] peanutbutterandbacon: peanutbutterandbacon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:07:11] butlerlog: she seemed locked in the box though and the SoD player lets her out, weird way to time travel
[1:07:14] lilysteel29: @TaliesinAndEvitel I love we getting anduin back this Summer so hyped I missed our boy King
[1:07:15] Nontus135: Is this a Classic/Retail crossover story???
[1:07:21] Karvenboom: They did say "found photos" I guess tho
[1:07:24] aeson_of_raid_sock: Could Xalatath kill pre nerf C'thun?
[1:07:27] ItsLadrana: hillsbrad
[1:07:29] MeggoArt: i thought it was darkshore?
[1:07:31] seanstrachan: Hillsbrad
[1:07:36] mattzomix: i thought hillsbrad
[1:07:38] jumzo: its next to arathi
[1:07:45] Teth33: I thought there were multiple locations.
[1:07:46] butlerlog: shes in a box in blackfathom depths and you free her in alterac
[1:07:46] adnan2: basically
[1:07:53] jumzo: the arathi
[1:07:54] MeggoArt: that's what i get for not playing SOD lmao
[1:07:55] JMan31337: @Atomicpanda I used to be the same way until I started making macro combos for rotations
[1:07:56] AlanC2024: arathi
[1:08:04] djalminnha: Hilsbard is not Arathi
[1:08:08] thunduz: oh snap did something click?
[1:08:10] Teth33: The Arathor?
[1:08:13] Mulajin: it's hillsbrad up by ravenholdt, border of hillsbrad/hinterlands/alterac
[1:08:14] alextheblight: bggHmm
[1:08:19] DylanTheBard: I want her to turn up in a seasons of discovery esque event in classic cata, really want more of this hinting at her doing things in the background
[1:08:28] Karvenboom: She's next to big light crystal too
[1:08:34] thunduz: you are right
[1:08:36] Teghlin: THORADINS WALL
[1:08:37] thorwann: It seems like she is trying to pull a diablo, but instead of all the prime and lesser evils, she is just absorbing the other old gods
[1:08:39] Nulgar: What was the name of the ancient evil you fought in an Arathi quest? She used a female Titan Keeper model
[1:08:39] alextheblight: correct
[1:08:40] thunduz: tneTaliWasRight
[1:08:40] SerThunderbeans: Real question is: Who are the HILL BRADS?! ariW
[1:08:45] Teth33: Hillsbrad was part of the Arathi kingdom before it fell if I remember.
[1:08:51] mattzomix: are humans from hillsbrad the hillsbrats?
[1:08:53] MC_WhiteNoiz: Yeah she's next to a giant light crystal behind Ravenholdt. NE of it
[1:08:59] Greyzag: Do you think they are going to try and bring SoD together with retail (Read:merge rune system and lore) since they are doing timeways stuff and dropping xal in SoD.
[1:09:00] AlanC2024: the kingdom of stromgarde is on the border which was the city of the arathi
[1:09:15] Atomicpanda: hillsbrad foothills might as well be the arathi lowlands
[1:09:28] Mulajin: idk if it's ACTUALLY xalatah or just her model
[1:09:37] Karvenboom: Next to a giant light crystal too
[1:09:38] butlerlog: incorrect. you encounter her locked in a box in blackfathom deeps, you then free her in alterac/arathi/hillsbrad border
[1:09:38] theguyfromabove: and there is a giant glowing crystal
[1:09:43] Elrathir: peanutbutter AND bacon? whoa what a combo
[1:09:51] Trebled_Mind: I think it would make sense if Xalatath is like Thanos in some way. Because after the old gods failed to turn the world a void titan/god, this is Xalatath’s way of saying “fine I’ll do it myself”. Take all that void essence and go directly to the world soul yourself.
[1:10:05] AlanC2024: naaru???
[1:10:37] Saevash: @TaliesinAndEvitel what if the crystal is the end of the sword? :P
[1:10:42] Taleniel: Is that not like the stone Ashbringer was made from?
[1:10:57] Teth33: My theory is it's a "primal" Naaru. It's the raw material the titans used to created "ordered" light beings.
[1:11:02] Karvenboom: Look what she's next to
[1:11:04] Atomicpanda: seems like they picked an interesting place to build dalaran.
[1:11:16] DylanTheBard: can't wait to bring my pala back for that mog
[1:11:19] AlanC2024: sweet looking mogs
[1:11:28] Elrathir: and they like cool armor!
[1:11:30] thunduz: dopeness
[1:11:40] butlerlog: we might see the top of that crystal in alterac in SoD
[1:11:44] MC_WhiteNoiz: There's a big light crystal next to xal in Hillsbrad. (not sure if you'd been there)
[1:11:45] DiscordianKitty: they're not happy about the crystal going voidy
[1:11:58] chico_escuela: She’s collecting all of the blood/essence’s of the old gods for the void lords.  the old gods failed and she’s tasked to clean up after them and to succeed in their plan
[1:12:00] Atomicpanda: YAY! he said the thing!
[1:12:00] Magfaeridon: YOU DID IT!!!
[1:12:05] AlanC2024: their version of the winter is coming in GOT. Long period of day then night
[1:12:05] seanstrachan: Omg you said it properly 👏🏼👏🏼
[1:12:07] Magfaeridon: YOU SAID IT RIGHT!!
[1:12:11] Dillogy: Assumedly it starts turning voidy on a cycle  after a story event
[1:12:18] Magfaeridon: I'm so PROUD of you, Tally!!!
[1:12:20] Taleniel: Ashbringer was made from a crystal that was void made light by paladins and priests, could that be the origin?
[1:12:30] Nulgar: Almost the entire northern EK was Arathi lands, doesn't mean much that this character is near the modern-day zone named Arathi
[1:12:31] lilysteel29: @TaliesinAndEvitel im so happy we getting anduin back this Summer im super hyped for it i missed our boy King so much
[1:12:35] butlerlog: its a BIG crystal too, way bigger than a Naaru. could totally be the top end of the war within crystal.
[1:12:37] Trebled_Mind: so maybe Xal is the equivalent of Loki in Avengers 1
[1:12:49] Farmoure: Wasnt ashbringer part of a naaru?
[1:13:01] alextheblight: true
[1:13:04] Atomicpanda: i want xal to be the new void elf  faction leader.
[1:13:08] mattzomix: no alexandros found the void crystal on an orc warlock
[1:13:15] alextheblight: that'd be pretty cool
[1:13:29] Elrathir: I need some of those Arathi mogs
[1:13:34] Dillogy: Dillogy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 10.2.5 Hype
[1:13:38] Nulgar: @mattzomix who took it from Draenei
[1:13:41] butlerlog: the light crystal is how you break the void prison that is holding her.
[1:13:42] Karvenboom: It's like BY her
[1:13:42] chico_escuela: she will def be neutral to us at the ends, even helping us at some point
[1:13:44] AlanC2024: plus the old  caverns of time dungeon to resue thrall there was a evening with the paladins and the crystal. Again in hillbrad
[1:13:50] alextheblight: mail looks sick
[1:13:54] Karvenboom: Literally behind the guy taking the pic
[1:13:55] Moonshain: yo, you still spewing out shit theories?
[1:13:56] kpee_: Didn't Magni forge the Ashbringer?
[1:13:56] Elrathir: Furry collar bis!!!
[1:14:02] dotonbori: Love the inquisitor look for the cloth
[1:14:06] seanstrachan: Cloth is amazing!
[1:14:09] Deralis: LUL
[1:14:11] alextheblight: love the furry stuff
[1:14:14] alextheblight: ....wait
[1:14:16] seanstrachan: Leather looks lame
[1:14:17] Trebled_Mind: we all love furry bits around the neck
[1:14:22] MeggoArt: i think my spriest is gonna be allergic to this place
[1:14:28] WynneTheFox: So, will Anduin drink the Kuva after he defeats the Grineer sisters or not in the War Within? (Warframe has an expantion by that name)
[1:14:28] Atomicpanda: player housing under arathi highlands tneDorkthyr
[1:14:34] Deatheran: what a first time chat man
[1:14:38] alextheblight: leather looks a bit mishmash-y
[1:14:39] databob1: gotta love a furry neck
[1:14:42] thunduz: I need that plate set
[1:14:43] girlfrmmars: Tali, is your alert from BG3 or has Evie recreated the line? The second part really sounds like Evie to me.
[1:14:48] chico_escuela: we gonna see some new light/fire spell effects I hope
[1:14:50] seanstrachan: Probably won't be puffy in game though BibleThump
[1:14:53] Dillogy: The papers on the cloth reminds me of Warhammer 40k
[1:14:53] alextheblight: most of it don't match
[1:15:17] AlanC2024: the cleansing of the asbringer crystal takes place in hillbrad on the old caverns of time dungeon. coincidence?
[1:15:20] girlfrmmars: The second part sounds like Evi to me
[1:15:31] Deralis: LUL
[1:15:33] girlfrmmars: Autocorrect doesn't want me to type her name out
[1:15:34] thunduz: lol not the same vibe
[1:15:39] girlfrmmars: Ohhh, yeah, that's bad.
[1:15:45] HSAyril: Together uwu
[1:15:49] Atomicpanda: together yippie!
[1:15:56] Ryall_: as long as they don't say anyways I'm ok
[1:16:06] Elrathir: together yaaaaay
[1:16:06] Jokervenom1978: karlach is Bae!

[1:16:30] thunduz: tneEvi
[1:16:33] lilysteel29: You saw my post?
[1:16:39] razor3d: Maths sounds worse
[1:16:43] Nice_n_Dicey: agreed
[1:16:44] Nulgar: It's called Mathe(mathik)
[1:16:44] DylanTheBard: a british person saying math sounds the worst
[1:16:46] Atomicpanda: riot!
[1:16:51] revan4686: so amazing that show made up there is goin 2 b a season 3
[1:16:51] Ryall_: there is more than one
[1:16:52] Kindosar: I have a degree in mathematics from US.  It's maths.
[1:16:56] Mewsette_kitty: maths sounds insane, clinically insane
[1:16:58] Aakku: We could call it Freedom Adding
[1:17:02] Xulu_: How f*cking good is Lee Pace, the guy that plays Empire/Day?
[1:17:05] Trebled_Mind: maths are not mathing
[1:17:12] seanstrachan: It's Mathematics not Mathematic
[1:17:19] kpee_: It's maths... we do it more than once.
[1:17:20] WynneTheFox: Mathematical!
[1:17:21] razor3d: Almost as bad as Car Park
[1:17:28] thunduz: Lee Pace is Ronan in the MCU isn't he?
[1:17:28] AlanC2024: the crystal in Hallowfall may be below hillsbrad where the top of the crystal could be. The top of it could of been the shard for the ashbringer
[1:17:30] mattzomix: in germany we say mathe :P
[1:17:30] Trebled_Mind: Algebraic!
[1:17:34] MC_WhiteNoiz: "I have shit takes" "Even you're on my side I don't want to argue" WHAT DID YOU DO WITH TALI
[1:17:36] databob1: I could get behind maths
[1:17:36] tarnishedvalor: lee pace is theeee best
[1:17:37] chico_escuela: yeah he was ronan
[1:17:48] thunduz: I think he is
[1:17:48] Nulgar: @xulu_ didn't actually like him in Guardians 1, but he was great in Pushing Daisies
[1:17:49] cabeshpash: lol
[1:17:49] runehako: lolol
[1:17:50] Atomicpanda: maybe in the future they combined them all into one mathematic
[1:17:51] SquiggySquonk: He is.
[1:17:52] saarkhastick: I would think it would be maths if you're talking about types of math, math if you're discussing a single type. Maths does sound weird though.
[1:17:54] diarrhea_lad: What in the world did I just join to
[1:17:55] Noznatation: married to a man ye :D
[1:18:00] tarnishedvalor: correct he is

[1:20:52] Nulgar: @cabeshpash saw some thumbnail on YT and thought "wtf, is this really about Foundation?"
[1:21:05] Grimdaddy95: I got the "big gay" vibes from Brian J Smith years ago watching Stargate and Sense8 so I understand it tbh lmao

[1:23:46] Nulgar: Shoe cam inc?
[1:23:47] GameingAspect: ADD to cart
[1:23:52] tarnishedvalor: oh yeah those are great...they'd last
[1:23:53] runehako: sweet baby jesus
[1:23:57] Karvenboom: Bro you're literally playing children's game for a living. This isn't so crazy
[1:23:58] thunduz: oooooo I like the blue
[1:23:59] Noomiad: go buy them now :D
[1:24:00] DylanTheBard: wow what a steal :D
[1:24:01] Sunspar: okay those do look fantastic though
[1:24:02] Kindosar: why are they so expensive?
[1:24:02] fen_bear: oooo they look really nice
[1:24:03] Noomiad: while they are on sale
[1:24:03] Nulgar: Those are shoes that should cost 50€
[1:24:05] TheOnlyTelesko: wtf.....
[1:24:07] zeckzeckzeck: I'm not a shoe guy so this baffles me. They're just shoes!
[1:24:09] dotonbori: Male Uggs
[1:24:11] Atomicpanda: i guess?
[1:24:12] Dillogy: They better make you jump 3 stories for that price
[1:24:13] seanstrachan: Ew
[1:24:14] GameingAspect: red?
[1:24:14] cabeshpash: 375 pounds for shoes WutFace
[1:24:15] jurassic_rabbit: they're on sale? you can't afford to NOT get them. :P

[1:24:23] databob1: thats far to heavy for shoes.. :D :D
[1:24:23] Pymart: looks like blue jeans
[1:24:26] AlanC2024: i can buy them. and then have no money for food for the month :D
[1:24:30] MeggoArt: vimes boots theory
[1:24:31] tarnishedvalor: totally agree, tali
[1:24:32] ambernadams: those blue shoes are For the Alliance!
[1:24:34] Teth33: They look like suede Doc Martens
[1:24:37] jumzo: made with real monkey
[1:24:41] Coloredtoad: Are they authentic monkey though??
[1:24:42] lilysteel29: tneNzothEye
[1:24:51] Lenitas: If you can afford it, never go below 100 for shoes
[1:24:53] amaya21: can we see the lighter beige?
[1:24:56] GameingAspect: SUED
[1:24:58] runehako: at that price they better be authentic monkey
[1:25:03] Nulgar: Nono, if those shoes broke down in less than 4 years I'd sue the company for the 50€
[1:25:10] databob1: I kinda like the blue but their your shoes
[1:25:12] Dillogy: Did an Ethan really Monkey those shoes though?
[1:25:16] zeckzeckzeck: Now granted I did spend $500 on winter boots but those will last years
[1:25:19] The_Action_Man: can you also eat the meat the leather comes from?
[1:25:24] Atomicpanda: i'll know the name of the cow they're made of
[1:25:25] GameingAspect: oh life time gurartee is worth
[1:25:26] Arlaeya: Well-made shoes will last and last and not mess up your feet. worth the investment.
[1:25:27] WynneTheFox: GET THEM FEET COBBLED
[1:25:29] Jokervenom1978: so they are made from 100% real monkeys?
[1:25:29] Xulu_: A lifetime guarantee on shoes?!
[1:25:29] alextheblight: sick shoes tho
[1:25:37] witchhobbit: oh i need to know what are your opinions on doc martens
[1:25:39] runehako: Ethan is the name of the Monkey that was skinned for this shoe
[1:25:39] thunduz: A friend of mine gave some advice. Spend your money on things that keep you off the ground
[1:25:45] kpee_: You know where the leather from Adidas comes from.... China fake leather. No?
[1:25:47] Kindosar: ah so its its quality shoes made by people that are paid appropriately with other benefits, makes sense.
[1:25:49] Nulgar: There are good shoes for 50€, Tali
[1:25:49] databob1: they will let him pet the cow that they make the shoes from
[1:25:50] aeson_of_raid_sock: If you order online you don't get to run down an aisle to see how they fit
[1:25:51] zeckzeckzeck: @kpee_ jetpacks it is!
[1:25:52] alextheblight: the monkey died for a good cause
[1:25:58] ambernadams: I once bought a pair of British made Docs that lasted me over 20 years. You’ve got to amortize the price over the lifetime
[1:26:10] StoneFaceWoW: buy for life is my motto
[1:26:17] Dillogy: I can get behind that, but I feel like its a bit much. All the power to you tho
[1:26:18] StoneFaceWoW: over buying cheap crap
[1:26:19] witchhobbit: like are docs still worth buying
[1:26:20] Xulu_: For £500 they better speak to you in several different languages
[1:26:22] judaxtheshaman: those shoes are slay AF
[1:26:22] Arlaeya: insert Terry Pratchett's boot boot theory here.
[1:26:25] Jokervenom1978: At least get the bright blue ones.
[1:26:28] GoldSmog: You should never tell the internet you're buying yourself something nice
[1:26:28] tarnishedvalor: the shoes i bought were pricey, but i've also worn them for a decade, so that works for me
[1:26:29] Atomicpanda: how much for a cobbler to make a pair of shoes?
[1:26:30] BurningCrusader: @Xulu_ Fr
[1:26:34] databob1: my feet are huge even mid shoes for me are like $80
[1:26:40] ambernadams: Docs aren’t worth it anymore for the most part, they are now mostly made in China
[1:26:46] GameingAspect: air jordans are good :)
[1:26:50] aeson_of_raid_sock: What a steal!
[1:26:53] jumzo: got to ask yourself why they're that cheap
[1:26:54] amaya21: can we see the first one?
[1:26:59] thunduz: treat yourself
[1:27:05] thunduz: nop
[1:27:06] zeckzeckzeck: for me it's about the comfort - assuming you've tried them on and they fit great, why not
[1:27:06] aerissune: Just buy them and enjoy them!
[1:27:11] skewlbeta: suede no question imo
[1:27:17] Muurnne: I did the same when I had some extra money once. I bought a pair of really good boots. 10+ years later they're as good as new
[1:27:18] TheOnlyTelesko: any shoe that can have that big of a sale isn't worth the sale price to begin with
[1:27:20] nytebayne: leather seems better than suede to me.
[1:27:20] GameingAspect: get red!
[1:27:20] Ryall_: i love the red
[1:27:22] thunduz: Ronald Mcdonalds shoes lol
[1:27:22] runehako: how much for size 15
[1:27:24] databob1: oof that red
[1:27:25] Xulu_: To think how decked out Tali would be if it wasn't for that pesky student loan?!
[1:27:25] zebercetanayurt: go red
[1:27:26] ambernadams: I suspect bespoke shoes are thousands of pounds, don’t really know though
[1:27:29] Lenitas: The red ones def give me bowling shoe vibes
[1:27:29] Jokervenom1978: The red ones look like bowling shoes
[1:27:38] jumzo: blue ones are a bit much
[1:27:42] zeckzeckzeck: suede is a pain with rain
[1:27:45] lilysteel29: What Sword? we going to in war within tneTali
[1:27:48] aerissune: Brown are classy
[1:27:53] AlanC2024: omg. I am flying to karazhan to farm the mount. cannot wait for dragonriding tomorrow
[1:27:54] Truedsson: do they come in black though
[1:27:57] databob1: they look comfortable
[1:28:01] WynneTheFox: Don't get blue suede shoes. People will step on them.
[1:28:03] ambernadams: I mean Jimmy Choo’s are 2K US, $500 isn’t that much
[1:28:10] thunduz: they look very Tali shoes
[1:28:26] The_Action_Man: I don't know the term - Monkey Shoes?
[1:28:26] thunduz: they pass the vibe check
[1:28:36] kpee_: Can't wait to step on you Monkey Boots at BlizCon this year.
[1:28:37] Atomicpanda: stay off my blue suede shoes
[1:28:40] runehako: TREAT. YO. SELF.
[1:28:51] databob1: I wear really nice hiking boots in the winter very comfertable
[1:28:54] zeckzeckzeck: oof, they don't really have many in my size lol
[1:28:58] Ryall_: I'm saving for a 4090 so I'm barefoot at all times
[1:29:03] zeckzeckzeck: unless UK sizing is widly different
[1:29:09] Jokervenom1978: I just couldnt allow to spend that much money on shoes
[1:29:12] zeckzeckzeck: 13-14 US
[1:29:16] thunduz: I just started replacing laces and damn that is a world I didn't know existed
[1:29:29] diarrhea_lad: my shoe size is "wide as hell"
[1:29:34] theguyfromabove: have you had a look at Red Wings shoes? Beautiful leathershoes
[1:29:34] Xulu_: just a size lower. no?
[1:29:41] thunduz: I think our sizes are 2 below yours so our 12 is your 14?
[1:29:49] AlanC2024: i got Nike shoes in April last year for £42. Still using them and are fine with em
[1:29:51] tarnishedvalor: google says 13 us is 12.5 UK
[1:29:51] DylanTheBard: 13-14 US is 12.5-13.5 UK shoe size
[1:29:56] jumzo: I'd be wearing those to bed
[1:29:58] LilStinker: my buddy is US 13 and he usually has to special order shows
[1:29:59] Noomiad: also it s a treat. so i guess, if you like them, they are defo worth it
[1:30:00] databob1: @zeckzeckzeck I'm 14 w or 15 normal width
[1:30:03] thunduz: 100%
[1:30:05] StarShopping95: YEP
[1:30:05] sebnificant: Also it's nice to have nice things every now and then.
[1:30:11] MikeyGy: very true
[1:30:15] Trebled_Mind: I spent $200 on nice old English style leather boots and I have no regrets.
[1:30:16] Arlaeya: Your feet carry you. give them the best gear
[1:30:17] DiscordianKitty: I'm obsessed with wine gobllets made out of crystals - 150 quid each and i've never needed something more
[1:30:18] Lenitas: Shoes are definitely a "spend more save more" situation
[1:30:24] Atomicpanda: money is why i can't have nice things
[1:30:25] sprrriggan: boots theory!
[1:30:27] Dillogy: I once was told to always spend money on the things that separate you from the ground
[1:30:39] kpee_: We should spend money on Chairs that you set everyday, Mattress that you sleep everyday, and  shoes that you wear everyday. Or else you body is gonna be broken by age of 50
[1:30:40] NotIeni: they do say to always make sure you have good shoes and matrasses
[1:30:43] ambernadams: yes US men’s shoe size is one size larger than UK. Draw your own conclusions.
[1:30:44] StarShopping95: @Trebled_Mind EZ
[1:30:44] CrossroadsDealer: shoes and beds. most important. half the time standing half the time sleeping. got to be good.
[1:30:44] Jokervenom1978: I guess that fair.
[1:30:52] Truedsson: It isnt that weird tbh, people spend hundreds on a gaming chair. Shoes are not that different when you think about it
[1:30:53] Unciatim: UK MENS shoes half size less than US
[1:30:55] thunduz: @Dillogy a friend just told me that a bit ago and I was like damn that's brilliant and makes sense
[1:30:57] amaya21: what if you get bored with it though?
[1:30:58] jiveyivey: @kpee_ literally was just typing the same thing lol
[1:30:59] ryarose42: I've noticed shoes have been worse and worse quality and keep breaking, so high quality is the way to go!
[1:31:03] tarnishedvalor: @TaliesinAndEvitel also, people shuold do the yearly price...you get a $400 pair of shoes, that's what..40$/year if you use for a decade
[1:31:04] Muurnne: that's how shoe economics work
[1:31:06] Lenitas: @Dillogy Yes! Shoes, chairs and matress are key stuff to spend good money on
[1:31:08] aerissune: Glasses are something else to spend money on if you wear them.
[1:31:11] BurningCrusader: @DiscordianKitty Where do I get some, asking for a friend
[1:31:11] The_Action_Man: better quality shoe is SO MUCH BETTER for your feet too. I started buying better quality shoes and my feet feel so much better
[1:31:12] WynneTheFox: @TaliesinAndEvitel is going the long way about Vime's Boot Theory
[1:31:20] Atomicpanda: i should spend some money on my butt
[1:31:21] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: MY problem is, not all companies MAKE what I wear, which is a size 16 in US sizes (roughly a 50 in EU sizes).
[1:31:24] neverbornlucky: Till the dog pees on the shoes you spent 350 dollars on or cat
[1:31:41] butlerlog: fly due west until you see the ravenholdt manor
[1:31:43] butlerlog: up the hill
[1:31:46] dotonbori: Have you got the Artifact in your bags?
[1:32:03] Atomicpanda: *the* hill
[1:32:08] thunduz: N S E W
[1:32:10] mmofangirl: mmofangirl subscribed with Prime.

[1:32:13] dotonbori: back to the bank
[1:32:23] MeggoArt: i'd think the trading post tmog woud have a better chance of working
[1:32:27] seanstrachan: Just using the transmog whispers to you
[1:32:27] tarnishedvalor: so you have an argent gruntling? those do banks
[1:32:38] lilysteel29: the mog work I think
[1:32:40] Xulu_: I paid off my student loan last year. I forgot that it was taken from my salary pre-tax, so was jebaited in to think I would get the fill amount back in to my bank account again.
[1:32:45] alextheblight: legion artifacts work
[1:33:00] l0nnl0v: check if allie has the warfront . then there is a portal from Boralus. if you need to go to the bank
[1:33:23] alextheblight: yes
[1:33:24] databob1: to be fair I have a really good chair but I payed nothing for it. it's my second chair of the dead. Chairs I've enharited from people that have died...this one was like new when I got it
[1:33:25] Atomicpanda: hot
[1:33:28] mattzomix: yeah it is
[1:33:35] butlerlog: i'll give you the coords in a sec
[1:33:42] Saevash: /way #1416 88.6 73.6 Shadowy Figure in season of discovery
[1:33:42] alextheblight: that's the PvP tint, right?
[1:33:46] butlerlog: ok
[1:34:13] alextheblight: the 10 rated bgs one
[1:34:17] mmofangirl: Love your stream
[1:34:19] Grimdaddy95: PVP artifact skins are account wide now thankfully :)
[1:34:30] butlerlog: so you just flew over it. on the hinterlands map its only slightly below the equator of the map, and ALL the way to the west of it
[1:34:35] saarkhastick: Just grab Tom Tom
[1:34:51] butlerlog: its a pond at high altitude connected to the ravenholdt manor by a narrow valley
[1:34:55] witchhobbit: i think you can still get PVP legion appearances now
[1:35:16] seanstrachan: You can indeed
[1:35:17] Davykuro: Hi Tali
[1:35:19] DylanTheBard: it's honor levels
[1:35:20] Awthornn: i have not played WoW since BFA around Ashzara patch, but NE getting a new capital make me want to come back for some reason
[1:35:22] alextheblight: to be clear, it's the rated BG tint for the mage tower appearance
[1:35:30] RIckjamesx: it also unlocks for all of your chars when youve done 1
[1:35:30] dergNwolf: tippiEgg
[1:35:36] butlerlog: i'm there rn i could just invite you if that isn't less fun
[1:35:38] JunkyardQuokka: getting 10 wins is for the mage tower skin
[1:35:46] alextheblight: other way
[1:35:55] alextheblight: it's in Hillsbrad
[1:36:48] cardrenn: I just wished they put more effort in the translation for my language tho
[1:37:05] Lenitas: The best part about Belthamel is in the post raid quest as Nelf being able to also give an offering
[1:37:05] Awthornn: it would be cool if some Daranassus or OG Teldrassill soundtrack will play in Bel Ameth
[1:37:17] figurines: it says AND evitel. but its always this sexy guy instead
[1:37:42] GoldSmog: actual cursed child
[1:37:42] zanleren1997: Do you think we'll get videos like Warbringers for The War Within?
[1:37:43] DylanTheBard: ooooo
[1:37:45] AlanC2024: cool
[1:37:45] DylanTheBard: Welcome home
[1:37:45] PoliVamp: It's a good video
[1:37:52] Trebled_Mind: can’t wait to have that beautiful treehouse.
[1:37:57] DylanTheBard: welcome home as they're looking at the tree house?
[1:38:03] DylanTheBard: player housing please
[1:38:12] butlerlog: sorry i cant figure out how to invite across faction across servers
[1:38:29] Nagimitsu: You think they'll go the full 8 hours for maintenance?
[1:38:35] alextheblight: yes
[1:38:38] kallam19: @butlerlog put in name and then server
[1:38:40] AlanC2024: they are teasing us with player housing
[1:38:41] WynneTheFox: WoW needs a massive overhaul in the game play for winning me back. It was fine for back on dail up, but I need it to be less wide and more deep
[1:38:59] butlerlog: yeah there it is. so the pond is full of a massive holy crystal
[1:39:09] Waxx90: ooo are we searching for knifu?
[1:39:16] PoliVamp: You're gonna jinx it and it's gonna get extended now
[1:39:35] zanleren1997: do you think we'll see one of those pre expansion video series like warbringers for The War Within?
[1:39:39] dotonbori: you might need the artifact itself?
[1:39:47] MeggoArt: Use the trading post staff!!
[1:39:53] AlanC2024: after the cataclysm crystal was hidden. what if its the top of the crystal in hallowfall
[1:39:58] DylanTheBard: @zanleren1997 there's no way they won't do that, those videos go hard
[1:40:15] Aakku: there is also desecrated gorehowl to test with, it does old god whispers too
[1:40:15] butlerlog: what i love about this is that it is key to getting the only of 2 epics someone could get in SoD, and there are no quests leading here. they had BiS items behind a secret finding thing which i genuinly love.
[1:40:18] Nulgar: Wait, you don't carry the Artifact version with you?
[1:40:51] Teth33: She's a lady who likes to travel light
[1:40:55] alextheblight: SoD only
[1:40:59] Nulgar: I carry so much shit with me, especially on my main
[1:41:05] AlanC2024: maybe they are adding it retro actively
[1:41:07] jumzo: only sod but would be cool if it was in cata classic
[1:41:10] alextheblight: yeh
[1:41:17] Awthornn: Idk if i'll come back honestly, i'm GW2 player main, and paying a subfee again + the xpac is kinda annoying to me especially if i play only one month or so

[1:43:00] lilSOB: So do you have to collect the dungeon NPCs like the table freinds in WOD?
[1:43:02] AlanC2024: be great if the ashbringer crystal was from the hallowfall crystal
[1:43:03] ambernadams: I finally got a work from home day so I could have played some morning WoW, but alas.

[1:43:08] DylanTheBard: it's the best
[1:43:12] DylanTheBard: no spoilers

[1:43:32] Deatheran: as someone who raids tuesday nights, i would be sad
[1:43:35] Promilie: Im just really curious what the gilneas questline mount and transmog are
[1:43:43] jessetenfour: Tali, your priest set looks awesome.
[1:43:51] magisterofquelthalas: I thought crystal was in a different place
[1:43:52] Zafarak: good evening fam

[1:44:12] zeckzeckzeck: Surely adding Transmog was the biggest QoL
[1:44:13] bladestitch: Going to do so much more old world stuff when I can dragonride.
[1:44:15] CipherEx: I thought the SELFIE Camera was that
[1:44:18] lilSOB: Do you collect the dungeon npcs like you did with the mission table freinds in WOD?
[1:44:19] SquiggySquonk: I've been so excited for this patch.
[1:44:19] AlanC2024: plus gilneas and belemeth :D
[1:44:24] MeggoArt: Incorrect: crossfaction grouping still wins
[1:44:35] BlueBlurPrime: dracthyr should of had this flying at start to be honest
[1:44:39] Trebled_Mind: do you think Demon Hunters should also be able to fly like Dracthyr?
[1:44:42] DylanTheBard: if there was no transmog I wouldn't play the game lmao
[1:44:49] alextheblight: yep
[1:44:51] Nulgar: @zeckzeckzeck Transmog isn't Quality of Life, Transmog is Life
[1:45:02] VimFuego1970: transmog saved the game
[1:45:02] Reminii91: how long are they going to hangon to the %15 speed reduction for dragonriding, do you thinki?  feels like covenant again, they're being stubborn on these things for no reason...
[1:45:05] Lenitas: Can't wait for flightform dynamic flight
[1:45:16] AlanC2024: people are still moaning about dragonriding and it staying
[1:45:17] JunkyardQuokka: I want demon hunter glide to be like current soar but activated off glide with no actually abilities.
[1:45:29] Atomicpanda: like how wildstar survived on housing.
[1:45:30] AlanC2024: pre patch
[1:45:32] CipherEx: Demon Hunter dynamic flying when?
[1:45:44] lilSOB: DO you collect the dungeon npcs like you had to collect WODs mission table friends?
[1:45:46] sScottyKarate: what is dynamic flight exactly?
[1:45:50] AlanC2024: no
[1:45:50] ambernadams: I suspect the 15% debuff might go away after they redo the old world zones
[1:45:52] Saevash: also we are closing in on the skull and bones patch
[1:45:52] Vaephera: cross realm guilds?
[1:45:53] Lenitas: Cross realm
[1:45:53] tommytheecommie: I just finished the weekly reset, what’s the dragon riding trick for max speed?
[1:45:53] lilysteel29: I got my wolfif Ready for tomorrow
[1:45:55] magemaster225: is it not just cross realm guilds
[1:45:56] Popicus: Cross realm
[1:45:57] AlanC2024: its interesting
[1:45:57] DylanTheBard: cross sever isnt it?
[1:46:02] MeggoArt: did you see the datamine hints for dynamic ground mounts ?
[1:46:29] pattar101: whats a dynamic ground mount?
[1:46:29] Waxx90: holy crap that sounds amazing
[1:46:30] bladestitch: Just missing dynamic swimming then as well.
[1:46:35] zanleren1997: would be cool if that were the case though, who wouldn't want Lerroy Jenkins as their follower npc?
[1:46:37] CipherEx: I wanna see what the dynamic flying looks like for the flying horses
[1:46:40] Theorof: Will there be flying in the Silvermoon zone?
[1:46:42] MeggoArt: wow Tokyo drift incoming
[1:46:54] Waxx90: imagine getting a ground speed boost and jumping off a hill/ramp
[1:47:00] magisterofquelthalas: @pattar101 like those in GW2
[1:47:04] Nulgar: @Theorof probably not until the rework in 12.0
[1:47:05] VzualLeader: how much longer do you think we have left this season 3 ?
[1:47:05] VimFuego1970: dynamic sailing when?
[1:47:07] teodrad: If my DH had soar i would play him again first time since legion
[1:47:16] butlerlog: i wouldnt be surprised for silvermoon's revamp waiting until Midnight
[1:47:21] AlanC2024: dynamic flying in silvermoon as from midnight expansion
[1:47:21] Taleniel: which one?^^
[1:47:23] alextheblight: I did the proving grounds recently to get a feel for Preservation and I hope the NPCs there also become part of follower dungeons. They're a fun bunch
[1:47:24] magisterofquelthalas: depends on mount
[1:47:24] Vaephera: Need the silvermoon revamp first, silvermoon doesn't actually have a proper 3d model, it's all missing if you go behind it
[1:47:26] kaijoe_: There are a few
[1:47:26] MikeyGy: mountaing goats jumping POG
[1:47:31] balrog727: Do you play SOD?
[1:47:37] kaijoe_: One is a jackal that teleports forward
[1:47:40] Nulgar: Silvermoon, Eversong and the Ghostlands are like smaller than Forbidden Reach
[1:47:45] DylanTheBard: that would be so good
[1:47:48] Taleniel: 1 jumps long 2 jumps high
[1:47:50] bladestitch: What features do you think they avoid simply because it might be game breaking?
[1:47:58] Promilie: Each mount in GW2 has a unique ability and feel to it. There's a leaping raptor, a super fast racing roller beetle, a teleporting jackal, a high-jumping rabbit, a waterskimming manta-ray thing
[1:47:59] saarkhastick: Or jsut not have any underwater content, even better.
[1:48:00] kaijoe_: Roller Beetle goes very very fast
[1:48:01] volkner_1: make it fun and flood nazjatar
[1:48:01] Saiyori: Dynamic underwater mounts for a naga storyline in Midnight is my dream
[1:48:02] Awthornn: depends on what ground mount , the raptor is a leap, the jackal is teleport and there is also a roller bettle
[1:48:03] Phenroi: They need to give underwater breathing if you are mounted on a swimming mount
[1:48:06] CrossroadsDealer: I got the Druid beta fish transmogs. so dope
[1:48:13] magisterofquelthalas: all i know is that the whole thing developed over a long time so there are varities etc
[1:48:18] zanleren1997: Water water mounts being fun probably wouldn't happen unless they did like maybe a....pirate expansion? >:3
[1:48:28] Promilie: The most important thing is to make it -fun-
[1:48:34] Promilie: The "joy of movement" as the GW2 devs put it
[1:48:34] MeggoArt: Tokyo drift
[1:48:40] Theorof: We need the space ship from Legion and use it to go anywhere.
[1:48:42] dergNwolf: so like the silverhide whistle from Shadowlands
[1:48:46] dergNwolf: but even faster
[1:48:47] magemaster225: niffen tunneling so you can go under trees
[1:48:49] JunkyardQuokka: yes drifting ftw
[1:48:50] Animeinn: Underwater mount is cool, but there's hardly any reason to go underwater right?
[1:48:51] mattzomix: cats could be good jumping mounts and so do raptors
[1:48:52] Nulgar: Riding the Seahorse in Vashj'ir was great because it was faster than Epic Flying
[1:49:10] bladestitch: I see people racing of cliffs if it works like that. XD
[1:49:11] ScottyJStream: I just want to know what 10.2.6 is going to be... do you think we get any hints on that this week or next?
[1:49:22] Cloudsleeper: Mount in certain indoor spaces like caves and such. Use them for wall climbing. Would only work with certain kinds of mounts. Just ideas
[1:49:22] Nulgar: sure, I meant at the time
[1:49:23] tarnishedvalor: like a faster druid water form
[1:49:26] DiscordianKitty: people hated vashj'ir though
[1:49:28] magisterofquelthalas: more "dynamic"
[1:49:28] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you have a prediction as to when 10.2.6 will be announced and released?
[1:49:31] nytebayne: pirates!
[1:49:35] Nulgar: a modern incarnation would be better and faster than Dragonriding
[1:49:40] zanleren1997: What about Mounted combat? What would you think if they tried adding that ingame?
[1:49:41] teodrad: people also loved vashj'ir
[1:49:46] magisterofquelthalas: Nightsquall?
[1:49:47] Coloredtoad: So with the patch today and keeping with how things have gone so far we should see what the skull and bones are very soon!!
[1:49:49] MeggoArt: 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
[1:49:50] MikeyGy: we should ask MR GM Kappa
[1:50:03] astralumi: 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
[1:50:05] AlanC2024: unless they do no ptr and surprise us
[1:50:13] Muurnne: dragonriding encourages you to fly close to the ground. I think raw speed wouldn't be enough to sell ground dynamic mounts
[1:50:22] MikeyGy: love to see it for him too
[1:50:24] ambernadams: They’ll keep it secret right up to launch just to mess with us
[1:50:26] KenobiKidTTV: season 4 late March or early April?!
[1:50:38] Nulgar: they might do PTR for obvious changes, but not test the Pirate stuff at all
[1:50:56] Animeinn: Why season 4 has no patch no
[1:51:02] bladestitch: Could be fun if different ground mounts worked differently depending on the enviroment.
[1:51:06] tommytheecommie: Tali, what’s the trick for max speed dragon riding that you mentioned in the weekly reset?
[1:51:29] amaya21: its probably somewhere around the end of february as the winter ends then
[1:51:38] Bjerreh: Bjerreh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[1:51:39] MikeyGy: its will be 10 years this year since last Dragon Age game and the fandom is kinda expecting the lowest bar at this point but its a weird case
[1:52:04] JunkyardQuokka: "delays are temporary, suck is forever" -Gaben
[1:52:16] saarkhastick: @bladestitch Yeah, you should be able to climb mountains on a goat mount, for example.
[1:52:17] Kortinas: Kortinas subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 19 months, nice! Thank you for the content
[1:52:33] Muurnne: this roadmap sold me the yearly sub
[1:52:35] astralumi: it really does
[1:52:40] razor3d: Keeping the community informed is almost as important as how often content comes out.
[1:52:41] amaya21: it's informative
[1:52:49] Kortinas: @muurnne me too
[1:52:51] Coloredtoad: Alpha is so soon!!!!
[1:52:55] ambernadams: I bought an annual sub after seeing that Roadmap, which is normally not something I would have done at this point in an xpac
[1:53:49] AlanC2024: i got the new gradonriding mount with this yearly sub. its nice
[1:54:06] butlerlog: they also do pretty well at making sure that at any given time ONE of the wow versions has something that only just came out. and they don't overlap the releases either.
[1:54:07] Sadbe: rich get richer
[1:54:09] DiscordianKitty: you're doing boots theory
[1:54:12] Coloredtoad: Yearly sub is made out of the brains of those monkeys used to make those shoes
[1:54:15] bladestitch: I got mine.
[1:54:19] butlerlog: if you enjoy all versions of the game you are eating good this and last year
[1:54:22] Popicus: Did you check your gifts in bnet?
[1:54:24] alextheblight: I got my treee noodle
[1:54:25] AlanC2024: its a gift in the battlenet launcher
[1:54:32] agamitv: blacklisted?
[1:54:38] Popicus: That's rough
[1:54:39] aarongspot21: How many msub mount has Evi got?
[1:54:42] GoldSmog: Better complain on the forums
[1:54:43] Muurnne: the yearly sub is like the boots thing yo said earlier
[1:54:44] foxgibb0n: I had to relog into the launcher but was also delayed
[1:54:44] ambernadams: Is it less than 6 months before your annual renews?
[1:54:51] DiscordianKitty: lmao @aarongspot21
[1:54:52] Phenroi: Check your mounts tab in game if it's a gift there?
[1:54:55] Vaephera: mine just showed up in game, not the launcher
[1:54:57] Radiopools: You missed the fine print that excludes your account specifically :P
[1:54:58] Saevash: I've had a similar problem Myff it will arrive at one point
[1:55:00] jessetenfour: Doesnt matter, its less than 6 months for mine to expire, but i got the mount
[1:55:03] Kortinas: Cheers!
[1:55:13] ambernadams: They might have given Evie the mount twice. that checks out
[1:55:14] ScottyJStream: Mine shown up in the collections tab, not battlenet... interesting.
[1:55:17] Taleniel: my renews in feburary and I got it
[1:55:18] Karvenboom: See, still blacklisted
[1:55:29] Labott: Is it an active reaccuring year sub? Apparently that makes a difference? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:55:30] NotIeni: Shit i must have gotten yours, cos i got it even tho i changed to a monthly. sorry
[1:55:32] grimblymcgoo: Any chance the payment method is expired?
[1:55:38] foxgibb0n: Took me like a month to get the tree mount
[1:55:38] Sindorein1124: I just joined in - is it in your mount journal? Mine did not go to the "accept gift" thing on the launcher like they have in the past
[1:55:39] MillyLynn: I got my mount with less than 2 weeks left on my 12 month sub
[1:55:42] kpee_: Did Evi get two mounts?
[1:55:47] viirracocha: i got it aswell, not been playing the game for 3 weeks, and got it in the battlenet launcher to claim, and i payed for 6 months like 3 months ago
[1:55:49] Theorof: Evi will probably get hers first.
[1:56:01] Sindorein1124: Evi probably got multiple on her account
[1:56:07] nytebayne: your being punished
[1:56:11] Aakku: Did you check your bags? lol
[1:56:27] Redmanpig: same for me. did you pre order War within?
[1:56:28] nytebayne: *you're
[1:56:29] Labott: Maybe ask Danusar where your mount is Kappa
[1:56:38] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel  did Evi get two mounts?
[1:56:38] Muurnne: Muurnne subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:56:51] foxgibb0n: Bobby denied this to you as a parting gift
[1:56:52] magemaster225: is it on your NA acct?
[1:56:56] bladestitch: Spent my sunday trying to teach my brother, who hasn't played in a while, to Dragonride with hilarious results.^^
[1:57:09] mattzomix: did you try to log off your accout and log back in?
[1:57:09] alextheblight: hybEyes
[1:57:11] ambernadams: Bobby’s last act as CEO, lol
[1:57:18] thunduz: Tali has an NA account?
[1:57:19] MillyLynn: There was a glitch and for a glorious moment I had the mount in WotLK! 🤣 It was nice to see it for a bit since I haven't actually unlocked Dragonriding in retail
[1:57:26] girlfrmmars: did you try turning WoW off and then on again?
[1:57:40] adnan2: if its grayed out in your collections. have you tried collecting it???
[1:57:40] CipherEx: Took a few days for mine to come in too
[1:57:45] saarkhastick: I think I read something on Wowhead that mentioned you just aren't getting that mount.
[1:57:47] thunduz: try blowing on the screen
[1:58:01] mattzomix: did you try to log off your accout and log back in?
[1:58:05] Elrathir: pro tips only
[1:58:10] ambernadams: Have you filed a ticket?
[1:58:11] The_Action_Man: Did you give Metzen a proper handy?
[1:58:11] saarkhastick: Blow on the end of your printer cable
[1:58:13] bumblebee_cat: Oh I have the same issue, got the pet on classic but have not gotten the mount yet. Asked the forums and they said it is a known bug and they are working on it
[1:58:15] JarJar_Brinkz: Ahhhhhhh that's where you went wrong, never lick the cartridge
[1:58:15] BlueBlurPrime: I had to collect it from launcher
[1:58:17] vlaovich88: Why do you have 3 EU accounts?
[1:58:19] Redmanpig: War Within pre order had a free month, I think that screw up my 6 month thing
[1:58:21] zanleren1997: Have you tried asking it nicely?
[1:58:22] TankenFunk: Did you spam A + B when starting the game?
[1:58:22] Hippwn: Evi probably has it on her account haha
[1:58:26] CeasiusPls: my sub expired last month (bought WW for the +1 month) and I still got it
[1:58:28] bigmeanbeefy: But did you pray to the omnisaiah?
[1:58:31] AlanC2024: it looks good
[1:58:37] Cloudsleeper: Did you remember to plant your everbloom seeds?
[1:58:39] amaya21: blacklisted by the mount..
[1:58:40] Elrathir: did Evitel get two?
[1:58:52] thunduz: damn I think you're just out of luck then
[1:58:52] Animeinn: Is Metzen giving interviews?
[1:58:55] Lerosyl: did you buy company stock to be eligible?
[1:58:58] saarkhastick: Alt + F4?
[1:59:09] Deatheran: i got it on my 6 month sub
[1:59:16] BlueBlurPrime: it showed as a gift on my launcher, have you checked that?
[1:59:23] kaguranne: you get the mount with 6 month too
[1:59:24] Theorof: Up up down down left right left right B A
[1:59:27] thunduz: tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill
[1:59:33] Nusu1828: you mean MS stock, right?
[1:59:48] JMan31337: is there a mount limit cap?
[1:59:52] arcaneviolet: Do you have to claim it in the launcher?
[1:59:53] Lerosyl: Dont talk around it, we all know of the T&E Shell Company on Cayman :P
[2:00:15] ambernadams: The important part about being a paid corporate schill is actually getting paid. ;)
[2:00:16] Sharktribe: Look how fancy Tali is
[2:00:16] Hippwn: Can you imagine if people had to choose mounts to delete haha
[2:00:20] Destrolisher: I have Microsoft stock, I'll call them up for you
[2:00:44] pvalue01: if any of you invest in any kind of index fund, you have MS stock lol
[2:01:13] bladestitch: How do you think the dragonridig mount customization will work going forward when people will be able to use old mounts for dynamic riding?
[2:01:16] Phenroi: Get your vault filled this week?
[2:01:19] DragnosiOfNede: Cheer500 Have a great one Fam.  I'm off!  Let's Get on that Nekkid Penrin Tattoo!
[2:01:33] Yoliision: You have a great cheast deceHerz
[2:01:42] Destrolisher: there's a good chance your pension invests in index funds
[2:01:47] ambernadams: The pension is very likely invested in some kind of index fund
[2:01:50] DragnosiOfNede: An Index Fund is an investment account that is "Indexed" to a specific Market.
[2:01:51] Sadbe: index fund is generally considered a safe one
[2:01:53] s7wede: an index fund is like a hedge fund. You don't know the individual particulars of the stocks you invest in
[2:02:08] Aakku: ethical in late stage capitalism?
[2:02:10] Lenitas: I mean is there such a thing as ethical investments?
[2:02:12] DragnosiOfNede: E.G., You're invested in a fund that mirrors it's investments to the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[2:02:12] ambernadams: Pensions are usually invested VERY conservatively
[2:02:14] Nusu1828: especially a company like MS, solid financials year over year, dividends, etc. They're in pretty much every fund
[2:02:21] vlaovich88: Activision is still its own publicly traded entity. Ticker ID is ATVI
[2:02:36] coldhandsbeatz: private pension plan? those are a bit effy. at least in Spain public works the best and they have been going up in the last years so thats great
[2:02:58] l0nnl0v: before 23 January  you should get the mount
[2:03:00] Theorof: Sign up with an investment company and put money in. They let you choose what stocks or funds you put money in.
[2:03:00] Nusu1828: atvi was de-listed before the acquisition, it's just MS stock now
[2:03:31] Lerosyl: what have i done I was jokign
[2:03:32] Lerosyl: :D
[2:03:53] ambernadams: I have a pension through a US city, I’m a first responder. Fingers crossed it is still there when I retire!
[2:03:58] s7wede: are you part of an MCM or some type of affiliate network?
[2:04:00] Nulgar: @Nusu1828 curious, what happens with the stock that people are holding? Is it automatically converted to MS stock?
[2:04:08] pvalue01: promotion Pog
[2:04:09] Ryall_: in australia we have mandatory pension taken out of our salary called superannuation
[2:04:14] coldhandsbeatz: oh wow I thought UK also had public pensions. was it always that way?
[2:04:16] vlaovich88: @nusu1828 you are right. I looked into it and had a stock price so I assumed it was a thing but the date is October haha
[2:04:18] s7wede: content creation
[2:04:22] Nusu1828: @Nulgar They got paid out at the price agreed for the acquisition. I believe it was $95 a share
[2:04:24] The_Action_Man: I'm just banking on our capitalism forcing me to work to death, so I don't have to worry about retirement barbToxic
[2:04:31] Destrolisher: @Nulgar yeah ms bought my shares at that price
[2:04:40] SphericFormula: Multi channel network
[2:04:46] sirhc_knil: Omg hi Tali finally
[2:04:48] Cloudsleeper: Multi Channel something or-other
[2:05:02] SphericFormula: e.g. Machinima of yore
[2:05:18] JoeTheRedcoat: MCNs historically have been a nightmare.
[2:05:21] HSAyril: His 1 hair
[2:05:21] JarJar_Brinkz: LMAO
[2:05:35] Destrolisher: I mean that's the most predictable thing considering who he built it with
[2:05:51] cabeshpash: lol
[2:05:53] aragarde: Listen to me British man! :D i must ask what would you like to see in the next expansion!? I would like to hear what would be nice to have in the game?
[2:06:08] NoTimeToDieTV: kind of what people did to blizz employees when the lawsuits hit
[2:06:13] cabeshpash: that's what you sign up for tho
[2:06:29] The_Action_Man: wrong 'expansion' tali Kappa
[2:06:30] aragarde: A man of culture
[2:06:31] teodrad: honestly same
[2:06:37] amaya21: Evi will get jealous
[2:06:40] Destrolisher: knaifu expansion pls
[2:06:45] Elrathir: wall to wall'atath
[2:06:46] Lerosyl: So Evi is going to cosplay her?
[2:06:46] ryarose42: Ugh same
[2:06:46] ambernadams: But isn’t that already the case with Xal’state?
[2:06:50] Dillogy: Expansion? I want that for the rest of the game
[2:06:52] Promilie: I think Xal'atath is traveling through time collecting all the Old God infinity stones
[2:06:57] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel were you as annoyed as I was with "the return" of Preach to WoW? Why do all that?! Clicks?
[2:06:58] Sjaakstah: she will be sacrificed in the first patch XD
[2:06:58] Radiopools: She's even showing up in the past, wild
[2:07:01] bladestitch: What will you do if your wishes don't come through?
[2:07:09] MeggoArt: waiting for the xalatath/tali self shipping fanfics
[2:07:23] aragarde: For a moment i thought instead of great potential you were going to say great personality
[2:07:25] SphericFormula: I liked the snarky Arcane Mage staff in Legion
[2:07:42] s7wede: She's the morally grey Sylvannus we were promised in Shadowlands. I wonder if she was created to obfuscate Afrasiabi's butchering of the story
[2:07:59] HSAyril: I honestly have more faith in them doing her story justice now that Metzen is back into it.
[2:08:09] belicaldron: she's just on a beach drinking mai tais
[2:08:18] JarJar_Brinkz: He's no Pyro
[2:08:19] JarJar_Brinkz: Kappa
[2:08:28] DiscordianKitty: I really enjoy Preach
[2:08:37] Waxx90: is your speedometer when on your mount an addon?
[2:08:42] aragarde: O :
[2:08:45] Reminii91: shots fired
[2:08:46] kpee_: I agree with you, just the whole show was not needed.. we all knew he was coming back.
[2:08:47] cabeshpash: that's a lot of dicks
[2:08:48] Dillogy: Im glad when people who *like* the game come back. I hate seeing people jumping back in and hating on it all over again
[2:09:09] HazMatt_Prime: I don't want to kill Xalatath T___T
[2:09:14] HSAyril: I completely forgot to watch his interviews when he got back
[2:09:24] Jattell: the interviews felt really genuine to me
[2:09:36] Eirianwen: Eirianwen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[2:10:46] Nulgar: yeah we gotta stress that stuff changed from 9.1.5, DURING Shadowlands
[2:11:09] Nulgar: *changed in 9.1.5
[2:11:09] JarJar_Brinkz: But what about the FF players? PoroSad They need him
[2:11:24] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel  Thanks for that opinion. So right!
[2:11:30] PiccosDent: Oh servers up?
[2:11:41] TheDeekins: yeah one sec
[2:11:41] Nulgar: @PiccosDent EU
[2:11:43] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel new spoilers in wowhead just posted!
[2:11:48] CeasiusPls: Have you watched Arcane? Do you think there's lessons Blizzard can learn from Riot's world building
[2:11:59] HSAyril: Bad! Go put your nose in a corner
[2:12:15] aragarde: only see update on na right now
[2:12:21] Sharktribe: It's not a huge spoiler
[2:12:27] IdontBuyBread: IdontBuyBread subscribed with Prime. 
[2:12:35] Cloudsleeper: I'm looking anyway. I'm curious af
[2:12:39] Kortinas: No spoilers
[2:12:44] alextheblight: MrGM beat them to it
[2:12:45] skewlbeta: oh is it the one NPC?
[2:12:47] Nulgar: @CeasiusPls haven't heard anything of S2 yet, but what is there to learn? It's a show that is based on a game that existed for years, only now pulling together story bits. Of course that's good.
[2:13:13] Vaephera: There's another post about 10.2.5 ptr, went up just before the this week in wow post
[2:13:21] l0nnl0v: notable NPC articl
[2:13:22] DiscordianKitty: notable npc returns
[2:13:27] MeggoArt: xally
[2:13:32] MeggoArt: booo
[2:13:33] kittiezZ_: lmao
[2:13:34] aragarde: wow such spoiler
[2:13:35] MrScotticus: The thing we all assumed would happen is happening!
[2:13:35] kittiezZ_: "oh"
[2:13:35] AlanC2024: lol
[2:13:37] Jattell: :o
[2:13:37] Nulgar: what a non-spoiler
[2:13:38] ambernadams: MrGM is a machine.
[2:13:38] Sindorein1124: what a shock
[2:13:38] kpee_: lol
[2:13:38] alextheblight: yes
[2:13:39] Reminii91: WOW, NOWAYING
[2:13:40] Saevash: big wow
[2:13:42] Saevash: hahah
[2:13:42] JPagan2323: what a shocker
[2:13:47] Ealdfox: Isn't he dead Kappa
[2:13:53] alextheblight: he did mark it as spoiler
[2:13:56] CeasiusPls: @Nulgar IMO Riot is able to do some world building that is both inclusive and gritty. I think the latter is what is lacking in WoW in my personal opinion.
[2:14:02] AlanC2024: he didn't, he did the this week thing
[2:14:10] Cloudsleeper: Ysera literally said she was going back to restore the balance or some such nonsense. This was an obvious upcoming return
[2:14:16] Nulgar: @CeasiusPls we just came out of the literal afterlife, including Superhell
[2:14:17] s7wede: TBH there was a malfurion sized gap at the end when Ysera went back to Ardenweald
[2:14:21] Dillogy: I feel like he should have came back when Ysera left lmao
[2:14:31] SphericFormula: It's a bit beneath him
[2:14:33] OmgItsEdizzle: He's desperate for views. Complains A LOT about not doing well in the space
[2:14:37] SphericFormula: sort of non consequential
[2:14:41] Nulgar: @CeasiusPls it's not Warhammer-levels gritty, but that's enough, you don't have to copy Games Workshop forever
[2:14:42] CeasiusPls: @Nulgar and that has nothing to do with my point
[2:14:58] Reminii91: btw, @TaliesinAndEvitel , have you seen the Tide of Darkness mod for warcraft III reforged?
[2:15:01] Elrathir: He did spoiler tag it
[2:15:15] Sharktribe: tide of darkness is SO GOOD
[2:15:25] SphericFormula: Not really worth mentioning imo as it's a bygone conclusion
[2:15:32] alextheblight: it's legal
[2:15:34] Waxx90: what is it
[2:15:39] Sharktribe: It's totally legal and yeah it's finished and lovely
[2:15:42] JPagan2323: its a mod so i think its legal
[2:15:53] JPagan2323: its in the engine not some 3rd party version of the game
[2:15:54] Reminii91: yes it's good and Nobbel playin it so...
[2:17:08] alextheblight: there's what, now?
[2:17:12] SphericFormula: I guess it's engagement farm
[2:17:16] Nulgar: @CeasiusPls well I can't tell what you mean just from the word "gritty". S1 has some "gritty" bits, but Jinx was just "daddy issues" - that may be "gritty", but far from original or enjoyable
[2:17:29] ambernadams: There have been some threads on the forums speculating whether not to Malfurion will be in Bel’ameth. Maybe that’s what they are speaking to.
[2:17:34] sScottyKarate: theres a mount for the gilnaes quest line?!!!?
[2:17:34] HSAyril: Now that the threat to the Emerald Dream is over, time for Malf. to come back?
[2:17:35] ryarose42: I think it's when it is a leak of something that we all emotionally know is coming from the story and the spoiler robs the emotional payoff that was built up
[2:17:40] Elrathir: I kinda see what you mean
[2:17:41] SphericFormula: It is what it is but doesn't pass the vibe check :D
[2:17:46] dergNwolf: that's the twitter blue engagement sadly
[2:17:48] dergNwolf: gaySad
[2:17:49] hectorian01: Maybe because it feels lazy?
[2:17:50] ScottyJStream: It gives you the "ick"
[2:17:54] dwolf010: hopefully its a carriage mount
[2:17:55] alextheblight: neat
[2:18:11] peacefrog04: Weird vibes
[2:18:35] DozlaT: I would never think in a million years id hear tali say ick lol
[2:18:37] skewlbeta: it was not confirmed when MrGM posted it I think, but at the same time super not surprising?
[2:18:38] Labott: Maybe because it's such a small minor update it seems worth while as a social media post, as a main site post? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:19:15] Nulgar: well, anything that removes the fucking faces
[2:19:25] HSAyril: I feel like someone making their stuff official when it isn't actually makes me pay less attention to them
[2:19:44] Destrolisher: the BatChest meta
[2:19:51] JPagan2323: the o face meta
[2:19:58] JPagan2323: :o
[2:20:13] s7wede: I can understand why content creators want to standardize their content creation as it allows them to collab with Blizzard more often while not affecting the overall "style" of the video
[2:20:14] Radiopools: The fact that you could arguably create a college course on YouTube thumbnail creation is wild.
[2:20:18] alextheblight: "You WON'T BELIEVE what's COMING to WoW!! HUGE Spoiler for PATCH FortHype "
[2:20:29] Nulgar: yeah it's the one thing I don't like about your videos - I know it's sarcastic and ironic, but at some point it loses that status and just becomes following the mainstream
[2:20:32] alextheblight: sorry, needed more red circles and arrows
[2:20:34] Greyzag: wait, wait, wait, this isn't official????
[2:20:49] CeasiusPls: @nulgar so I'm guessing you didn't like it? Sure character drama is a great point that arcane has that wow lacks. I didnt think shadowlands had any grit. And DF disneyfied the class struggle of the dragons vs dragonkin. Vs arcane that had plot and intrigue of piltover and zaun, while still being an inclusive show
[2:20:57] ambernadams: This is better than official.
[2:21:07] magisterofquelthalas: I never have much opinions on thumbnails, but i do realize when a thumbnail was prepared nice and dandy
[2:21:24] Nulgar: @CeasiusPls oh I liked Arcane otherwise and oh, you used the buzzword "disneyfied", yeah I'm done interacting with you
[2:21:32] The_Action_Man: The number of "Pog Face" Thumbnails bothers me. I may be getting old LUL
[2:21:36] dergNwolf: I love how Maximum sometimes has like 3 videos in a row using the exact same face as thumbnail werenwLUL
[2:21:39] alextheblight: nooooo
[2:21:47] Ryall_: I have a thumbnail remover extension
[2:21:50] Sadbe: everyone does this
[2:21:51] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[2:21:59] s7wede: I can't stand when they oversaturate the images so their teeth look super highlighted
[2:22:00] funviking99: I hate that face thing thumbnail , where they are shocked
[2:22:01] aeson_of_raid_sock: Do some poses for us
[2:22:11] cabeshpash: I hate it too
[2:22:14] CeasiusPls: @nulgar I mean im not a regular viewer so if there's a stigma against it I didnt know
[2:22:19] pvalue01: shocked pikachu facd
[2:22:20] gryffiest: I hate it
[2:22:27] cabeshpash: it comes across as disingenuous to me
[2:22:35] alextheblight: RuleFive *video*
[2:22:39] Dillogy: Do some poses now so you can pull it
[2:22:48] peacefrog04: Does it affect video numbers?
[2:22:50] The_Action_Man: She is hotter than you
[2:22:56] cabeshpash: lol
[2:23:04] HSAyril: Do you go in knowing you're gonna take a face from the video or is it just kinda "if it's there, it's there"?
[2:23:36] ambernadams: I just assumed Evie is the one who does all the production.
[2:23:36] Shirey12: Malfurion is back!
[2:23:41] alextheblight: wonder when those platekinis will be available
[2:23:48] Dillogy: I like the outline that makes you look like a sticker
[2:23:51] holyzeke: play your old tik tok video that’s my fav
[2:24:04] frankenfoot5: Hey Tali, just checked in. What are we chatting about now?
[2:24:06] kaguranne: I am less annoyed by the faces in your thumbnails than most others
[2:24:12] peacefrog04: LOL
[2:24:13] Lenitas: Bel established a meta
[2:24:17] dergNwolf: and I would never click on those videos
[2:24:22] dergNwolf: gaySip
[2:24:23] pvalue01: consumer psychology is weird
[2:24:27] pacificmoaner: when is .5 out
[2:24:27] funviking99: LUL LUL LUL
[2:24:29] foxgibb0n: Min maxes thumbnails
[2:24:33] Shirey12: @TaliesinAndEvitel have you checked wowhead recently? a new NPC has returned ;)
[2:24:47] d30xx: OMG roblox add, from my local bank ????!!!!
[2:24:54] ambernadams: Does Bel have a very large head in real life?
[2:24:58] magisterofquelthalas: I once thought ppl put those from the video itself, foolishness
[2:25:08] The_Action_Man: Middle of the video thumbnail makes it feel mor elike a 'conversation' to me. On the side makes it seem more like 'commentary'. Just my knee jerk take
[2:25:09] DiscordianKitty: it's leather but it's got lapels so he can wear it to work
[2:25:09] Elwhappo: middle of the road, middle of the thumbnail heh
[2:25:19] Greyzag: oh man Bel exposed reusing thumbnail headshots
[2:25:23] Nulgar: I think it was rather that the YT algorithm favored "personality"-based videos which featured faces, youtubers noticed it helped gain views, and adopted it. I can't imagine viewers actually preferring them over the same thumbnail without the face
[2:25:29] krow411: are the servers up??
[2:25:29] d30xx: Tali why does all your white shirts look yellow?
[2:25:31] CeasiusPls: @nulgar and further more you are quite rude so id be happy if you never interact with me again
[2:25:32] supercowsbrother: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you know Bellular irl?
[2:25:44] Harai_Ulfsark: @krow411 no
[2:25:50] s7wede: whatever you do don't go to youtube in incognito mode. You will get some weird ass shit
[2:25:51] kaguranne: @d30xx lighting probably
[2:26:01] Dillogy: Oh man boosting those sub numbers with your own channels Tali
[2:26:01] pacificmoaner: is he as handsome irl as on video
[2:26:02] Shirey12: Malfurion has returned chat
[2:26:14] macilento12: is this a ptr?
[2:26:20] Efendal: mrbeast retroactively changed all his thumbnails to a closed mouth because the ones with a closed mouth clicked better. looks kinda creepy now
[2:26:33] d30xx: Can you do some facial acting? I saw in one of your videos you did acting?
[2:26:37] Harai_Ulfsark: @macilento12 no, its EU
[2:26:44] d30xx: That's a yellow shirt?
[2:26:44] Dillogy: Gottem
[2:26:45] DiscordianKitty: that'd explain it
[2:26:46] peep_chili: lol gotem
[2:26:48] Rev3rendBilly: Piss colored.
[2:27:03] macilento12: @Harai_Ulfsark k ty ty
[2:27:12] pacificmoaner: @Efendal i just looked. no he didnt.
[2:27:13] frankenfoot5: My least favorite trend is something I've seen Preach parody where the YouTuber makes an obnoxious/surprised face with the  headline "OMG X Game Sucks?" or "OMG Y thing good?"
[2:27:14] Sharktribe: I hate mr. beast
[2:27:23] Nulgar: TOLD YA - pog faces are revolting
[2:27:35] SlithTheSivak: r u going to MrGMcon in London?
[2:27:49] d30xx: Do you know mr beast irl?
[2:27:50] s7wede: One of these days, you will be able to use AI integration to keep thumbnails updated to the latest trend.
[2:27:51] HSAyril: You should change your vids to open mouth ;)
[2:27:51] DylanTheBard: change them all to gaping wide mouths lmao
[2:27:52] mxfelwinter: i think Bellular now put his face, because other channels started using the same font as his
[2:28:15] Nagimitsu: "Users love it when eyebrows are slightly arched and are light smirking."
[2:28:16] Gideon2826: Can you show flying in classic zones
[2:28:22] Nulgar: @SlithTheSivak oh, did he decide on doing that? I was in stream when he was still very hesitant to do a meetup centered on himself :D
[2:28:41] thunduz: that's the brand
[2:28:42] alextheblight: they change the thumbnail text a few times too
[2:28:42] Greyzag: maybe he onl;y has one shirt
[2:28:45] frankenfoot5: Damn, Tali is pulling the curtain back and exposing the man behind the wizard
[2:29:02] ambernadams: I think if I made YT videos I couldn’t be bothered to be camera ready any more than I absolutely had to be. I don’t judge them for it.
[2:29:05] MeggoArt: did you watch the new dan olson video ?
[2:29:06] alextheblight: preach is too poor to buy more than one shirt
[2:29:11] mxfelwinter: Preach doing the same face as Scripe there xD
[2:29:12] tarnishedvalor: that makes me want to make really bad exaggerated ones lol
[2:29:13] skewlbeta: LUL
[2:29:18] holyzeke: you should do a thumbnail with a baby filter
[2:29:39] Greyzag: we should do a shirt drive for Preach and send him some new shirts to wear for thumbnails
[2:29:42] HSAyril: Do you go into a Weekly Reset knowing you're gonna pull a face from it?
[2:30:05] thunduz: agreed
[2:30:11] krow411: you're saying it's youtube porn....
[2:30:15] Nulgar: yeah, not blaing individual devs, you gotta go with what works
[2:30:15] Nagimitsu: Seems disingenuous and tarnishes the experience for me.
[2:30:16] MisterBongwater: this needs the meme like the little girl from Totoro “angry” “surprised” “happy”
[2:30:26] dergNwolf: we have seen tali's concentrated gaming face
[2:30:31] Sharktribe: I hate it when they put their middle-aged man face on like, a sexy woman's body or something, it's like, friend i don't want that
[2:30:31] dergNwolf: phillieY
[2:30:35] Nulgar: @krow411 you're saying it isn't? tneEvi
[2:30:36] funviking99: the cringe of these thumbnails is too much
[2:30:44] buildragon88: playing World of Warcraft during maintenance? could’ve waited until the servers’ maintenance is done…
[2:30:45] ambernadams: It’s not hurting anyone. I get the artistic integrity of authenticity, but the algorithm doesn’t give a fig because frankly viewers don’t
[2:31:05] DozlaT: it's like game of thrones with the face people
[2:31:35] SlithTheSivak: i wonder if u could use AI art creator Dall-E 3 to just "Make a youtube thumbnail in the style of TaliesinAndEvitel"
[2:31:35] kaguranne: @ambernadams we aren't saying it's hurting anyone. we're saying we think it's annoying
[2:32:19] dergNwolf: critique the idiotic viewers
[2:32:23] dergNwolf: tippiHype
[2:32:26] Demeternoth: pears are gross though so I concur XD
[2:32:32] Muurnne: it's really tacky though
[2:32:34] MisterBongwater: how long has it been since people started shitposting in the forums for the sole purpose of appearing in a weekly reset
[2:32:49] ambernadams: OMG now Tali is getting blacklisted by the pear lobby
[2:32:54] MisterBongwater: there was definitely one this week I’m sure
[2:33:02] databob1: don't like pairs?!?! well I never
[2:33:31] alextheblight: perfect side-by-side expressions, by the way
[2:34:01] MeggoArt: tneMovEviHeartEyes
[2:34:07] DylanTheBard: speaking of greenscreens, not scene the weekly reset yet but the patreon behind the scenes, descending greenscreen from the ceiling was hot
[2:34:09] ambernadams: Tali and Evie doing a night of improv in front of a green screen, streaming gold
[2:34:19] thunduz: 100%
[2:34:33] MisterBongwater: haha
[2:34:37] aragarde: I love that facial expression
[2:34:57] OmgItsEdizzle: When is next podcast?
[2:35:09] aragarde: le gasp
[2:35:09] SlithTheSivak: do you guys practice improv acting at home?
[2:35:10] thunduz: oh you got the screen up? that's newly done right?
[2:35:14] Argonautica: this one is very good
[2:35:51] thunduz: nice! you've been wanting that for a while now haven't you?
[2:35:53] Eirianwen: Sorry you broke the first one.
[2:35:54] mattzomix: hmmm that yellow shirt in the thumb looks familiar ^^
[2:36:02] d30xx: you have 3 notifications
[2:36:03] frankenfoot5: It's the perfect headshot for: "Oh no, WoW gaem bad" if you ever need a lot of money quick
[2:36:09] blumberquack: Honestly more of a "given up on life" look from you there LUL
[2:36:11] Mewt_75: thank you for the sub gift. unsure how/where/when i got it.
[2:36:17] jerkass: You look like you should be in a Guy Ritchie film
[2:36:21] aragarde: These are the faces i would expect a parent teacher conference in grade school
[2:36:26] aeson_of_raid_sock: You and Evi should do some really over the top ones to parody
[2:36:31] aragarde: if a kid did something very awful
[2:36:34] HSAyril: Go the Asmongold route of wearing one shirt
[2:36:36] magisterofquelthalas: she looks great
[2:36:41] ambernadams: Now you can have the satisfaction of pulling the map down over the chalkboard every day.
[2:36:51] thunduz: This looks like a spy movie comedy poster
[2:37:24] MeggoArt: are there any large channels that do your method do you know?
[2:37:50] thunduz: how long did preach have to sit there and make different faces in one sitting
[2:38:02] dergNwolf: large general channels are cringe as fuck anyway, but I realize I am not the target audience
[2:38:03] databob1: did  preach loose weight he looks  good
[2:38:07] Triz84: Jenny Nicholson?
[2:38:07] alextheblight: hbomb?
[2:38:15] buildragon88: playing as a Dracthyr? The Dracthyr Evokers’ story starts when they awaken from their slumbering petrification on the forgotten isles/Forbidden Reach!?
[2:38:22] alextheblight: he actively works out, so makes sense
[2:38:29] databob1: yeah the hair looks good too
[2:38:35] magemaster225: I dont understand movie reviews that give away the review in the thumbnail
[2:38:37] frankenfoot5: "Never Drink With British People"?
[2:38:44] aeson_of_raid_sock: Preach going full DILF
[2:38:50] ambernadams: Hairy Preach? Abomination.
[2:39:02] databob1: I don't really watch Preach
[2:39:12] Rico_Azzarash: Hewwo Tali! Hewwo chat! Sorry am late xD Happy monday stream on tuseday! XDDD
[2:39:38] thunduz: I don't like it. Looks cluttered
[2:39:38] aeson_of_raid_sock: I like the Preach videos that are like Unsolved Mysteries
[2:39:40] MeggoArt: interesting
[2:39:41] bangoobangoo: @magemaster225 You don't even want spoilers for the *review* of a movie? XD
[2:39:41] alextheblight: titles are too off for that, tho
[2:40:33] frankenfoot5: Yeah, unfortunately Asmon always just looks like that lol
[2:40:39] MisterBongwater: I can picture asmon going to the closet and pulling one of several white t-shirts off a hanger.
[2:40:47] mxfelwinter: hbomb upload like once per year, he only appear on thumbnail photo as he appear on the video (if he appear st all)
[2:40:49] thunduz: ugh
[2:40:50] ambernadams: Wranglerstar once explained that he took a page out of Jay Leno’s book and wears the exact same thing whenever he records so if he ever needs to edit something clothing doesn’t break continuity.
[2:40:57] dergNwolf: jesus
[2:40:57] HSAyril: He'd be wearing the same shirt a month later though lol
[2:41:01] DozlaT: I need a hazmat suit
[2:41:11] jumzo: these weirdos are so creative with the thumbs
[2:41:14] dergNwolf: how do people see this and WANT to watch that video
[2:41:14] Rico_Azzarash: I'm fine! Just woked up from a short nap xD Going to join Immo social run soon < 3 Thanks for asking! Hope ya doing well this days < 3
[2:41:15] frankenfoot5: Man, being a right wing jackass seems like such an easy job on YouTube lol
[2:41:20] alextheblight: fuck this guy
[2:41:23] thunduz: off the reservation thats messed up lol
[2:41:25] Reminii91: these negativity farmers are annoying
[2:41:25] jumzo: obligatory brie larson video
[2:41:25] blumberquack: Pull it! Twist it! Bop it! Turn it!
[2:41:27] MisterBongwater: actually I take that back that man owns no hangers we’ve seen how he lives lol
[2:41:32] Dillogy: Yiiiiikes
[2:41:35] boogitynut: gah, looks like he hates everything
[2:41:39] SlithTheSivak: I made gigs and gigs of AI art...
[2:41:39] HSAyril: "I wish I made more fake react selfies"
[2:41:40] Nontus135: So much nehativity
[2:41:48] ambernadams: I don’t watch Asmongold, I blocked him years ago. He’ll always do just fine though
[2:42:02] peacefrog04: I hate these kind of channels
[2:42:02] alextheblight: won't be any regrets. All he will have left is hate
[2:42:06] Lenitas: Looking at this, I'm happy I didn't really hear of this channel before, but now I'm sad that I have been made aware of it
[2:42:07] MisterBongwater: damn this is something
[2:42:10] Nontus135: I literally can't watch rage bait shit like that.
[2:42:18] Nulgar: hey, I do appreciate when the title is already telling me the creator is a right-wing dickwad
[2:42:19] jumzo: he's live with a very special guest
[2:42:24] Dillogy: Thanks for showing me this channel! Now I know to absolutely avoid it
[2:42:25] The_Action_Man: What about a gay brown woman?
[2:42:29] vlaovich88: Never seen his videos
[2:42:49] frankenfoot5: Tali's left mouse button is weirdly broken everytime he hovers over those videos. So strange
[2:42:54] The_Action_Man: ohhhh right right
[2:42:59] The_Action_Man: that makes sense
[2:43:07] Destrolisher: woman? political. gay? political. black? political
[2:43:13] alextheblight: why did he paste a black woman's head on top of a man's body in that thumbnail...?
[2:43:19] Magfaeridon: I tuned back into the stream at the WRONG time
[2:43:24] Timotikos: thanks Tali. my eyes are now burned to a crisp. 10/10 would recommend
[2:43:32] aeson_of_raid_sock: He's a hate farmer
[2:43:37] Ghostsweeper: what a conversation to pop into, love it
[2:43:38] alextheblight: yeah that tracks
[2:43:44] Nagimitsu: never heard of this guy
[2:43:46] MisterBongwater: at some point they turn the corner and love the hate
[2:43:50] aragarde: wait who
[2:43:53] HSAyril: I hate that. I have a friend who thinks if there's ever a colored and/or lgbtq person in the game it's simply to tick off a box
[2:43:54] alextheblight: well then
[2:43:56] tarnishedvalor: ditto never heard of him
[2:43:59] The_Action_Man: awww, he was watching out for the kids? How gallant
[2:44:00] frankenfoot5: Hey Tali did you know my bisexuality is purely political too?
[2:44:04] Destrolisher: let he who has not sold meth to kids cast the first stone
[2:44:07] The_Action_Man: The dealers I know only sell to adults
[2:44:09] AlanC2024: i have blokced his channel
[2:44:10] frankenfoot5: It's wild
[2:44:11] aarongspot21: This tea is nourishing!
[2:44:11] aragarde: Him?
[2:44:13] Dillogy: Oh no
[2:44:15] Nagimitsu: thequartering

[2:44:20] MisterBongwater: jesus
[2:44:22] girlfrmmars: My favourite thing is to block the hate farmers
[2:44:26] databob1: there's a heist movie on netflix called lift it was really good watched it the other day
[2:44:32] aragarde: Yea... i used to watch him and now he's just... he fell off the rails super hard
[2:44:33] aeson_of_raid_sock: Ah mute lol
[2:44:34] alextheblight: nooooo!
[2:44:34] Destrolisher: isn't this the guy who freaked out about starfield recently
[2:44:37] girlfrmmars: Like that one there. Yikes.
[2:44:41] girlfrmmars: Big fucking yikes.
[2:44:45] peacefrog04: Pronouns! lmao
[2:44:46] Nagimitsu: This is the "PRNOUNS" guy
[2:44:57] Rico_Azzarash: 6969 our goal? XDD
[2:44:58] alextheblight: @Destrolisher yeah he's the "FUCKING PRONOUNS" guy
[2:45:01] jumzo: do you eat tuna madras ike he does
[2:45:05] DozlaT: They're current daying us
[2:45:05] ambernadams: It’s so sad when you meet your neighborhood f*ascist
[2:45:09] Nulgar: I bet for the Echo video he didn't know which aspect to focus on
[2:45:16] Hikerguy74: wow this dude sounds like a maga-douche
[2:45:17] realGameTheory: oh no
[2:45:18] alextheblight: Family FamilyMan
[2:45:23] Dillogy: What family is it not for? What?
[2:45:30] alextheblight: dogwhistle, by the way
[2:45:31] aarongspot21: he would know a thing or two about tool's
[2:45:31] DozlaT: He's a glutton for punishment
[2:45:34] Nagimitsu: He'd know a lot about being insufferable.
[2:45:39] Cloudsleeper: lol, Doctor Who has been progressive for like, ever
[2:45:39] databob1: is he trying to meme himself again?
[2:45:44] AlanC2024: course he will
[2:45:55] frankenfoot5: Is it even a dogwhistle at this point?
[2:46:01] Hikerguy74: All these idiots do is dog whistling, idiot RWNJ
[2:46:02] girlfrmmars: But Tali, where are the TV shows and movies for men, though? Where is the man representation???
[2:46:06] Syllvn: Oh god Melonie Mac felt that far too
[2:46:06] realGameTheory: that thumbnail font is a crime
[2:46:06] HSAyril: I haven't watched it since Capaldi, is it worth catching up?
[2:46:08] teddyg55: he's just like me! I only watch things I hate which is why I'm here now (this is a joke plz no ban)
[2:46:08] AlanC2024: cringe
[2:46:13] Syllvn: fell*
[2:46:15] aeson_of_raid_sock: Does he cover right wing stuff like The Daily Wire's movies etc.?
[2:46:16] jumzo: keemstar tier thumbnail
[2:46:16] draxius34: Really?? Doc Who has been amazing. Just....wow
[2:46:20] ryarose42: The speech bubble looks so bad lol
[2:46:23] Karvenboom: I live in Moscow (fuck the war) so most of the world famous people who live there are war criminals
[2:46:27] Thuretical: miss when he was just about making wow guides. dudes really gone down the rabbit hole now
[2:46:28] Lenitas: Does he have any BG3 videos?
[2:46:29] Dillogy: Bruh what
[2:46:32] nyrhalahotep: this man is frightened of his own shadow. 😂😂😂
[2:46:33] MisterBongwater: an accent only gets you so far
[2:46:34] Nagimitsu: They're not dog whistles they're full-blown air raid sirens.
[2:46:45] peep_chili: If I didn't know these were real I would assume they are satire
[2:46:51] dergNwolf: Hunter B-52 or sth?
[2:46:53] zeckzeckzeck: Gugu Mbatha-Raw?
[2:46:54] Hikerguy74: Mbuthu Raw
[2:46:55] DozlaT: Oh the tva officer?
[2:47:01] Lenitas: Or is he to scared to touch BG3 because it's so universally beloved and *very very* gay
[2:47:03] Hikerguy74: oooo the agent
[2:47:08] Destrolisher: not even subtle
[2:47:14] ambernadams: The people who shout the most against homosexuality are usually hardcore closeted themselves.
[2:47:15] viirracocha: agree
[2:47:17] aeson_of_raid_sock: woman can't be brave of course
[2:47:18] Trebled_Mind: Geeze Heel must be exhausted carrying all that hate energy around all the time. I know I couldn’t sustain being that angry at everything so long.
[2:47:21] Ryall_: I enjoyed loki I know its marvel but it was actually ok
[2:47:25] aeson_of_raid_sock: women*
[2:47:25] The_Action_Man: I can't even work up energy to be upset. It's just sad
[2:47:26] AlanC2024: only black actress in loki i know is the head of the tva
[2:47:28] jumzo: @Lenitas he streamed himself playing it, no mention of pronouns or anything
[2:47:35] Hikerguy74: racist, sexist, garbage
[2:47:42] DozlaT: Has he always been like this? I remember he used to do blizzard bad videos
[2:47:47] girlfrmmars: well, he's a misogynist, too
[2:47:51] Lenitas: @jumzo Wild xD
[2:47:55] aragarde: he turned out to become a pos from when he made wow videos
[2:47:55] girlfrmmars: And a transphobe. and homophobe.
[2:47:56] shawnomancy: shawnomancy subscribed with Prime. 
[2:47:57] Thuretical: he’s basically the Quartering now
[2:47:58] zeckzeckzeck: To be fair to him, JustARacist was already taken as a channel name
[2:48:03] Andy__lol: He's got the look of a guy that records truck rant videos with his Oakleys on
[2:48:16] alextheblight: @Lenitas so weird none of them have had a Normal One about BG3 yet, honestly
[2:48:23] viirracocha: Reacher is a hit!! <3
[2:48:25] Dillogy: Sometimes it goes without saying
[2:48:27] shawnomancy: Cheers Tali
[2:48:40] databob1: I don't the actressess name remember but she is a fanaminal acterss in Loki. she really man the character easy to connect with
[2:48:45] realGameTheory: the red text on thumbnails, eugh
[2:48:46] Nagimitsu: Do you think he's actually racist or just farming the reaction for the grift? Either way, what a pos.
[2:48:49] GunsEvisu: oh it's the "fucking pronouns" guy
[2:48:52] realGameTheory: lmao
[2:48:54] Hikerguy74: yeah haha
[2:48:54] Karvenboom: What are his most popular video?
[2:48:55] thunduz: LOL
[2:48:59] databob1: oh no
[2:49:00] zeckzeckzeck: Both
[2:49:02] Harai_Ulfsark: @DozlaT he used to do exploration wow videos waaay back in the day, i followed him because of that, them some time he changed course and i had to unfollow
[2:49:05] alextheblight: not using incog is a bold choice, tbh
[2:49:05] Nulgar: you can remove videos from your history
[2:49:09] Karvenboom: Frank Reynolds in BG3 is a masterpiece watch it now!
[2:49:13] Trebled_Mind: thanks for taking one for the team on your algorithm
[2:49:19] nyrhalahotep: The far Right has a fear-brained problem, everything they hate takes intelligence to comprehend. No one wants to feel embarrassed, and ignorance leads to fear of ridicule, that in turn leads to anger, and then inevitably to hate of all types.  It's all based in fear.
[2:49:38] nimornico: Yeah, because at that point they've decided harm to minorities is an acceptable byproduct of their work.
[2:49:42] girlfrmmars: rip your algorithm
[2:49:57] aragarde: yeah i liked his wow videos and he just... turned into this pos...
[2:49:59] girlfrmmars: I'd call it pathetic.
[2:49:59] nimornico: Definitely not NOT racist
[2:50:03] peacefrog04: Joe Rogan went that way too
[2:50:06] zeckzeckzeck: Russel Brand did a similar thing
[2:50:09] DozlaT: @harai_ulfsark yea that must've been it, must be why I was subbed to him
[2:50:15] Thuretical: same, I used to enjoy his guides but he’s unhinged now
[2:50:15] Scathach73: Spreading the message is the same as believing the message IMO. Maybe even worse if they don't actually believe what they're selling,but materially the same result
[2:50:20] alextheblight: I saw the writing on the wall with this dude when WowHobbs made a video with him back in MoP. Even back then he gave me bad vibes
[2:50:23] Stickiler: Hard to tell whether it's a "turning in to this" or whether it's just "mask off"
[2:50:27] Nagimitsu: The "never meet your heroes" rule stands true.
[2:50:28] frankenfoot5: I watched my family go down the same rabbit hole over the last 10 years. It's been heartbreaking to watch in real time
[2:50:28] picanhatv: pls what is this Frank Reynolds in BG3 video, i need it
[2:50:30] girlfrmmars: for sure, I used to watch his videos.
[2:50:34] AlanC2024: i never seen one of his wow videos and I started when wow started
[2:50:44] Karvenboom: Watch the BG3 vid!
[2:50:47] realGameTheory: lmao 󠀀
[2:50:51] Stickiler: BG3 SPOILERS AHEAD
[2:50:52] MisterBongwater: he was always kind of a diet version of totalbiscuit and now he’s a twisted funhouse mirror of an idea of him
[2:50:54] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[2:50:57] frankenfoot5: TALI BIG BG3 SPOILERS
[2:50:58] tarnishedvalor: lol
[2:50:58] frankenfoot5: IN VIDEO
[2:51:03] Scathach73: Danny makes everything bteer
[2:51:13] picanhatv: LMAO this video is fire
[2:51:15] realGameTheory: this is so good
[2:51:17] Zaelsus: This channel is great at making these mashups LUL
[2:51:32] MisterBongwater: devito is such a champion
[2:51:33] jumzo: this guy pumps out bangers so often, his austin powers mass effect videos were so funny
[2:51:34] thunduz: this is amazing
[2:51:36] alextheblight: I like the Danny Devito in Lion King video
[2:51:36] aarongspot21: omg this is amazing
[2:51:49] Destrolisher: i gotta send this to my brother
[2:51:50] Zaelsus: Some people are saying that this is the true Dark Urge playthrough LUL
[2:51:58] Rico_Azzarash: OHHH THIS ONE IS AMAAAZIIING! AHAHAHAHAHAH XDDD
[2:51:58] runehako: lmao so good
[2:52:01] Sprokkitt: man i love always sunny
[2:52:05] thunduz: LOL
[2:52:08] alextheblight: oh wow that was seamless
[2:52:12] databob1: i love Danny Devito
[2:52:13] alextheblight: the handshake
[2:52:18] Nagimitsu: Frank is bard coded for sure.
[2:52:20] databob1: lol
[2:52:33] cardrenn: ***.ever
[2:52:39] Raghoulash_: LOL
[2:52:43] kittiezZ_: danny devito is a world treasure
[2:52:44] teddyg55: Is this a live action remake of your BG3 playthrough?
[2:52:47] itsKizune: greetings from eastern PA, US, where a snow day has allowed me to get out of work and finally check out a live! love what T&E does <3
[2:52:58] CeasiusPls: its a good thing I have no idea about anything I just saw
[2:53:13] Aakku: nope just checked
[2:53:18] Andy__lol: do we know what the pirate flag patch is yet?
[2:53:20] Karvenboom: Is Frank a chaotic evil or chaotic neutral?
[2:53:23] Solastro: 4 hours left for servers to be up according to blizz
[2:53:29] tarnishedvalor: servers are down..we're all in classic haha
[2:53:38] Thuretical: In before extended maintenance
[2:53:43] HSAyril: No pirates
[2:53:44] MeggoArt: i'm collecting theories about if something is gonna happen to genn this patch, what's your take
[2:54:03] realGameTheory: D:
[2:54:06] nimornico: Did you recently buy some gag gifts for someone lol?  These ads, man
[2:54:06] alextheblight: the article makes an interesting theory about Xal'atath that I like
[2:54:08] aeson_of_raid_sock: not a genn
[2:54:09] jimbowheat: Would they have given the Vampire Survivor dev some dosh or just ripped it off?
[2:54:09] MeggoArt: that's what i'm saying !!
[2:54:10] kanaab: We did have Vampirates in Stormheim
[2:54:11] alextheblight: nooo D:
[2:54:11] AlanC2024: he is old
[2:54:15] teddyg55: BASED
[2:54:16] MikeyGy: hisdaughter is called Quuen onPTR
[2:54:19] alextheblight: I just started liking him
[2:54:23] Stickiler: Big heroic sacrifice to get Gilneas back?
[2:54:24] Dillogy: Tess has been present more and more as well
[2:54:26] Eirianwen: No
[2:54:28] Muurnne: his daughter is ready to rule
[2:54:31] Aakku: Nice Genn you got there, shame if something would happen to him
[2:54:31] NotIeni: Nooo Anduin noo
[2:54:31] The_Action_Man: But he's a very good boy!
[2:54:34] dergNwolf: but if we kill him how can we have another BEAUTIFUL hd worgen in a cinematic again like in bfa gaySad
[2:54:35] Harai_Ulfsark: pls dont kill my king
[2:54:35] thunduz: you want to yeet the good boi?
[2:54:36] Andy__lol: finally get your country back and immediately die so you never enjoy it
[2:54:39] Rico_Azzarash: Noooo! let the doggo in piece... in ONE piece
[2:54:40] alextheblight: give him a tail first
[2:54:43] databob1: yes put that old wolf down
[2:54:43] shawnomancy: it's literally the GREYMANE wall
[2:54:44] Nagimitsu: Wall 2: Electric boogaloo
[2:54:46] l0nnl0v: and no more worgen leader then
[2:54:48] CipherEx: Give Tess good story then
[2:54:48] shawnomancy: so it makes sense
[2:54:51] mattzomix: he build the wall and the gileans payed for it
[2:54:53] Destrolisher: always a good day to kill worgen
[2:54:58] NotIeni: AND THEY ARE ALL DEAD
[2:54:59] SphericFormula: Keep Genn tho
[2:55:00] Reminii91: is Gilneas going to be a neutral city-state? or another Alliance city right next to the forsaken again?
[2:55:02] frankenfoot5: cAn'T believe WoW is so Woke by killing off yet another white male character at the end of his story arc and replacing him with his daughter /s
[2:55:04] Sharktribe: I love worgen but Genn always sucked
[2:55:12] zeckzeckzeck: And Jaina is his Mommy figure
[2:55:14] kso128: jaina?
[2:55:17] DylanTheBard: they don't have the balls to kill off Genn in a .5 patch
[2:55:18] l0nnl0v: No more worgen front person
[2:55:19] Nulgar: oh no, and Tess is next in line, more heels videos
[2:55:22] databob1: Genn is a bit of an ass
[2:55:22] The_Action_Man: His main plot point - Sylvanas - really isn't a thing anymore either.
[2:55:23] Thuretical: Andy has Sylvie now too
[2:55:32] Nagimitsu: Anduin just needs therapy at this point, not another father figure.
[2:55:35] MeggoArt: I like having Genn around BECAUSE he sucks, and it's important to have people who suck on the alliance too
[2:55:40] diyreality: he can just go i am too old of this sht and go full human in Westfall
[2:55:46] Andy__lol: maybe getting gilneas back is a chance for him to not be so shit at ruling
[2:56:01] bucephalos: He is the only one from the alliance leaders from wc2 who survived
[2:56:25] alextheblight: @bucephalos it's because he hid behind the Greymane wall
[2:56:55] CeasiusPls: Do you think there's recent media that Blizzard can learn from?
[2:57:22] DozlaT: yes take from saltburn
[2:57:27] Srebron_: boop cat nose
[2:57:50] alextheblight: the Spyro and Crash remakes, to mention a few
[2:57:52] Dillogy: I said it before and ill say it again, BFA was a banger
[2:57:55] zeckzeckzeck: The lesson is to hire the studio that made Arcane to make some WOW lore stories
[2:57:58] siber_duck: Sylvanas gonna show up and shoot Genn, right? stripAnya
[2:58:12] OmgItsEdizzle: Feel like bfa did it the best by far
[2:58:12] alextheblight: they did good with the Diablo 2 remake, though
[2:58:15] frankenfoot5: Yeah, relative to other xpacs I didn't enjoy BFA overall. BUT I 100% agree that the story delivery was the best its been in a long time
[2:58:30] CeasiusPls: @zeckzeckzeck I second that sentiment
[2:58:37] alextheblight: remaster, rather*
[2:58:46] kso128: i loved the BFA scenery and story, i'd be perfectly happy with BFA2 :D
[2:58:49] DozlaT: Love swen
[2:59:03] Saumur: Swen Vincke is best. Absolute (armoured) legend LUL
[2:59:05] Karvenboom: The emerald dream was the first patch when I did all the zone questlines (except the mount one, still on it) and treasures and stuff for some reason. DK why.
[2:59:18] zeckzeckzeck: Sven - "Always have a bear sex scene." Sage advice
[2:59:34] Fraudchemist: Fraudchemist subscribed with Prime. 
[3:00:01] alextheblight: @Karvenboom the sweet antler transmog, of course
[3:00:20] Nagimitsu: Maybe Blizzard can pick up the ex-WOTC employees who helped with the original lore points for BG3.
[3:00:25] alextheblight: wait, that's just the treasures
[3:01:21] remytwotimes_: Out of curiosity have you watched Arcane S1?
[3:01:46] Azikielboi: @TaliesinAndEvitel idk if u saw the idea that timerunning will see xalatath take ysharjs power before garosh, and the end of season of discovery will see us give the blood/heart of cthuun to xalatath, which i find as a really interesting thought as itd be a new way of delivering the story of wow through sort of new gameplay mediums, rather than normal quests
[3:02:01] Nagimitsu: BG3 is going to be really hard to live up to. Might be a few years before we get something else of that caliber.
[3:02:05] Rico_Azzarash: OOH! WAIT! There a new weekly reset  dropped whyle I was sleeping!!?? YAAAAAAY!!!!!
[3:02:20] Dillogy: The timerunning is surely the Vampire Survivor thing
[3:02:26] Muurnne: not even ended my first playthrough of bg3 and i'm already thinking on the next
[3:02:29] magisterofquelthalas: not enough content?
[3:02:33] teldariol: teldariol is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 84 in the channel! 
[3:02:34] teldariol: teldariol gifted a Tier 1 sub to kikisume! 
[3:02:34] teldariol: teldariol gifted a Tier 1 sub to boubotte! 
[3:02:34] teldariol: teldariol gifted a Tier 1 sub to cicerospqr! 
[3:02:34] teldariol: teldariol gifted a Tier 1 sub to Jahrakalis! 
[3:02:34] teldariol: teldariol gifted a Tier 1 sub to RobbayGames! 
[3:03:15] Nulgar: 7.2 was great in that it offered content that not everyone would see all of
[3:03:16] Discordant_Hats: It's the only way to make less-popular choices become popular too. Not giving content to the lesser played means they'll *always remain* less played.
[3:03:18] zeckzeckzeck: the bigger problem is not mixing both ideas
[3:03:19] magisterofquelthalas: yeah!
[3:03:21] Karvenboom: I think blizz should make more of content where you make lore choices (for your character)
[3:03:29] zeckzeckzeck: universal content and specific content
[3:03:30] Karvenboom: Like the sylvans quests
[3:03:33] DashzTV: Like them covenants
[3:03:37] Karvenboom: But maybe even more
[3:03:38] Azikielboi: idk i think a lot of people are just blind to taht, and only appreciate in retrospect
[3:03:44] diyreality: you might add heritage stories to that,  not everyone goes to level new char just for the tmog
[3:03:51] Ghostsweeper: I felt so "proud" (lacking a better term) because the story told to me in the order halls felt nearly personalized - though it wasnt.
[3:03:52] cardrenn: are u kiding, legion was when I made at least one alt of each class for that class specific content
[3:03:57] Zaelsus: If they do, it'd be a fraction of what was created
[3:03:57] Karvenboom: Make it only lore, not Player Power or cosmetic related
[3:04:07] GoldSmog: Kind of sad, I went back and did all the order hall quests
[3:04:09] magisterofquelthalas: ppl only appreciates wow in retrospect usually
[3:04:10] Mazerbeam: If you use legion time walking to level can you do the class order hall content while leveling?
[3:04:13] Lenitas: I'm more fine with it in a singleplayer game like BG3 rather than an always moving online game like WoW
[3:04:18] Ghostsweeper: I had 16 mains in Legion, did all mage tower things. All because of that.
[3:04:21] Dillogy: Covenants were *supposed* to be like that
[3:04:25] Ghostsweeper: uh, 16 alts, lol, not mains
[3:04:27] alextheblight: same. Never been as active with alts as I was in Legion
[3:04:42] Lenitas: I can never go back to mage tower, but I can always go back to BG3
[3:04:44] runehako: thats exactly what im doing right now. started dark urge run!
[3:04:51] Reminii91: level cap 100 was wild. can't believe we're heading back
[3:04:53] Sharktribe: I had a max level of every class in legion, did all of the campaigns, special mount quests, all mage tower spec challenges, etc. It was awesome.
[3:04:59] caradosailanthus: I liked when each faction had their own story lines
[3:05:01] AtomJar: I mean i didnt personally, i imagine they have the numbers on who much people played
[3:05:12] girlfrmmars: The biggest reason why I stopped playing WoW is because it got lonely. Everyone in my long-time guild eventually stopped playing and then finding a new guild that matched the vibes was so hard
[3:05:12] mattzomix: you could say that to bfa because for the whole story it was best to play alliance and horde characters
[3:05:30] alextheblight: did you mention that to him?
[3:05:30] cardrenn: where the hell did they get this feedback lol
[3:05:47] lacey_underall_: love your content. will you ever do a Durge run in BG3?
[3:05:59] thunduz: I love and hate it
[3:06:14] alextheblight: sweet
[3:06:23] Dillogy: You did the 12 classes one? Im doing it now
[3:06:26] Saumur: Amelia Tyler did a wonderful job on narrating the durge. It was horrific
[3:06:28] Nulgar: well, they tried again with Covenants, and their storylines were great - but people complained they couldn't pick their "BiS" Soulbind and preferred story separately, on their main. funnily enough, it was only AFTER that people started to complain that content shouldn't be tooled towards only the high-end players.
[3:06:46] Harai_Ulfsark: they had a start with the dracthyr exclusive quests
[3:07:08] Lenitas: As long as they always keep it available to go back to, unlike mage tower
[3:07:13] runehako: and romancable npcs. come on wow you can do it
[3:07:16] Mazerbeam: Especially with alts becoming more accessible with Warbands
[3:07:19] frankenfoot5: I was away refilling my drink, but I really hope you talked about Class Order Hall Storylines!
[3:07:36] Nulgar: yes, but gameplay that mattered only for high-end raiding/mythics
[3:07:50] Ghostsweeper: the idea of covenants were great. the issue is it f'ed over relatively tryhard players, that play one char, but also care about story.
[3:07:52] Ghostsweeper: I.e. Me.
[3:07:56] Ghostsweeper: gjakeW
[3:08:09] Nulgar: just pick "BiS Covenant" on your main, and do other stuff on an alt
[3:08:16] frankenfoot5: @Nulgar But even if people aren't doing that content, there is still a community perception that you *need* every advantage. So even pugging on Normal people will flame you for picking the wrong thing.
[3:08:39] Nulgar: @frankenfoot5 yeah but that's a *player* problem
[3:08:45] Hobblefoot: If you were to look at Covenants at the end of Shadowlands and had no idea or concept of their initial iteration, people would have loved them.
[3:08:46] Dillogy: Being semi-casual, I have never understood the complaints of BiS stuff in the game.
[3:08:58] Discordant_Hats: WoW is funny because they can never lean into the actual *narrative* changing because of you, in the way an RPG can. Wonder if the devs think that missing out 'feels bad' because you picked say, a race/class hours ago instead of an in-the-moment story choice.
[3:09:09] MeggoArt: mhm
[3:09:12] Karvenboom: I really like for them to do more quests and stories where you make meaningful lore choices for your character. It's a bit hard rn with how the game is structured. But I hope in the future they'll make more of such quests as Sylvanas one, but with more personal stakes
[3:09:14] frankenfoot5: Even if its a player problem, Blizz needs to acknowledge it in their system design to mitigate it to the best of their ability. And they've done just that in Dragonflight
[3:09:14] retiredrich: retiredrich subscribed with Prime. 
[3:09:22] Mazerbeam: Hero talents should really just be cosmetic
[3:09:24] Sharktribe: I am completely unsympathetic to the BIS-focused mindset.
[3:09:28] Ghostsweeper: I wish theydve done close to how FFXIV used to do cross-class skills.  I.e. You can pick one covenant to level for lore/cosmetics, then when you reach a certain point, you can "side" with another one, level it up, and use their covenant ability but skinned for your main covenant.
[3:09:38] Ghostsweeper: Wayy more work, but it'd've solved it all.
[3:09:39] mdh8473: The problem for me was that the story of each covenant gave needed context to the others, but it was linked to power, so you took a downgrade to get all of the story context
[3:09:41] Lenitas: I have no issue with hero talents it just feels like 1 in depth talent choice that's free from the rest of the talent tree
[3:09:42] Ruebeus: Its honestly not Blizz's fault. Its the players that use and gatekeep with meta.
[3:09:43] astralumi: yea FeelsBadMan
[3:09:52] thunduz: exactly. they should be cosmetic
[3:09:52] Lenitas: Well not in depth but large
[3:09:53] Dillogy: Its just one really big binary talent choice
[3:09:53] astralumi: i wish they were just class skins
[3:10:06] Sharktribe: so.... could you pick mountain thane, but then not take colossus? what happens? you just suck?
[3:10:13] Reminii91: don ppl just do that in content nowadays anyway with entire classes
[3:10:17] thunduz: I am
[3:10:18] JakeSezz: JakeSezz subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 55 months! Oh shit I didn’t even get an alert the stream was happening tneTaliCry Anywho great 10.2.5 video!
[3:10:19] Sch1ey: We will have of meta riders of the apocalypse because its that badass
[3:10:23] DylanTheBard: it depends how balanced they are, but obvs no ones hopes are high for that
[3:10:23] cardrenn: nah man I will have one alt of each hero talent 'cause insanity
[3:10:23] Ruebeus: But no matter how much they try to balance things, players will always crunch the numbers and say "THIS is the only way to play the class."
[3:10:32] thunduz: @JakeSezz welcome to the party
[3:10:35] Nulgar: It was literally people like Asmon that raged and tossed when Blizard tried more casual approaches in the Cata/MoP/WoD era
[3:10:40] picanhatv: i like hero talents being a power system, i never wanted it being a cosmetic thing
[3:10:40] zeckzeckzeck: I never thought it was aesthetic and always wanted it to be power/talents so...yay for me i guess
[3:10:47] JakeSezz: @thunduz saltyb27Cheers saltyb27Cheers saltyb27Cheers
[3:10:49] frankenfoot5: I'll be picking Mountain Thane because I main a dorf warrior. Even if its the worst
[3:10:56] platy_dev: Man its such a shame, class skins would be such an easy win instead of this
[3:11:39] magisterofquelthalas: I dont have the statistics
[3:11:54] Thoreya: i think theyre doing it so they add on to the already big talent trees we have
[3:11:59] picanhatv: i have no clue how this "class skins would be a big win" discourse came from, its a expansion feature, if it would be only changin the color of my fireballs id be pretty disappointed
[3:12:02] Thoreya: the spell looks are just a plus
[3:12:25] zeckzeckzeck: Cosmetic spell glyphs seems an easy win
[3:12:40] diyreality: this might be the war part in wow, you have to pick every advantage you can get against a hard pve and pvp encounter
[3:12:49] Discordant_Hats: Every new character, I go check out the auction house for glyphs to fit them. It's really weird that's been dropped instead of expanded.
[3:12:57] zeckzeckzeck: nothing, seems pretty clear
[3:13:01] zeckzeckzeck: I guess balancing?
[3:13:03] saarkhastick: What does Pack Leader get me?
[3:13:03] HSAyril: Cosmetic talent
[3:13:05] TaliesinAndEvitel: tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar tneKhadgar
[3:13:09] magisterofquelthalas: I would like twohanded weapons to be transmoggable to one handeds
[3:13:18] thunduz: can we just have them be cosmetic like glyphs
[3:13:20] SputnikTelevision: @TaliesinAndEvitel Have you played any SoD? I've been really loving it so far.
[3:13:22] Ruebeus: I mean, they already gave us an example. Isnt it obvious they are just a different paint job on a mini-talent tree?
[3:13:23] blumberquack: @saarkhastick A hiking stick and some trail mix
[3:13:25] mattzomix: when i got my hero talents will i still be adressed as champion or as hero?
[3:13:35] HSAyril: To balance it
[3:13:39] blumberquack: @blumberquack (but yeah tbh pack leader sounds really uninspired and bland to me)
[3:13:41] astralumi: "will it be balanced"?
[3:13:54] DylanTheBard: are they gonna be just as good in alll content would be my question, obvs the answer is no
[3:13:59] Discordant_Hats: Which ones include big cosmetic changes and which ones don't? Because they've seemed to indicate some have less or more than others so what's the goal here?
[3:14:00] dwolf010: will you play SoD on stream
[3:14:02] zeckzeckzeck: How much power they expect to tie to these, I guess. But again, I think it's a fairly simple system and they've explained it fine
[3:14:03] DozlaT: Chero
[3:14:09] astralumi: :D
[3:14:10] TaurusBerserk: the way i see it i think the hero talents will be you getting abilities from other specializations? is that true
[3:14:10] saarkhastick: @blumberquack Does the trail mix have chocolate chips in it?
[3:14:12] Ruebeus: Is there more info out there other than the Druid tree they showed off? I havent found anything new
[3:14:16] platy_dev: Would love to talk to them about how much they are trying to make it about class fantasy vs balancing for M+ raid etc..
[3:14:18] dymekfoxu: :D
[3:14:21] Dillogy: Are they going to be built for different gameplay (I.E one good for raids or M+) Or just general changes
[3:14:22] frankenfoot5: The only thing I want to know about Hero Talents is how Blizzard is going to treat it as "Evergreen" moving into the next two xpacs?
[3:14:36] trisynth: "Are there hero talents/builds that will completely suck ass and be totally ignored for the entire expansion?"
[3:14:41] blumberquack: @saarkhastick It claims it does on the packet but you end up with like 2 chocolate chips and mostly raisins
[3:14:41] frankenfoot5: What will Hero Talents look like in Midnight is a lot bigger than what will they look like in War Within
[3:14:44] dymekfoxu: actualy i need to see this patch on your stream :D
[3:14:45] ryarose42: I think having Xalatath in sod as a different timeline is so cool and such a smart idea
[3:14:47] dat_rougarou: "what class do you play? yeah, we hate that class. get bent."
[3:14:48] magisterofquelthalas: balancing...
[3:14:49] dwolf010: @frankenfoot5 just like the DF talents
[3:14:55] peacefrog04: the illusion of choice
[3:15:10] Dillogy: Lemmings
[3:15:16] witchhobbit: i mean, was this game ever perfectly balanced before?
[3:15:23] magisterofquelthalas: ppl just cant accept the classes to be viable enough
[3:15:24] saarkhastick: @blumberquack that sux. I like raisins too though so I'll continue my 12 mo sub renewal.
[3:15:25] Vaephera: mythic talents, presumably
[3:15:25] zeckzeckzeck: It's pretty clearly just a way to reward level-ups because it feels empty gaining levels without a "reward"
[3:15:30] HSAyril: Forget talents, I want to see more of the airplane mount for WW
[3:15:33] caradosailanthus: I need that 0.00001% DPS increase from this specific hero talent
[3:15:44] JakeSezz: @haleych that’s the rub cuz nope
[3:15:56] Dillogy: It doesnt matter if its a 0.1% increase, if its an increase, a creator will say its better and everyone will agree thats the only way to play
[3:15:58] Ruebeus: @zeckzeckzeck This
[3:16:01] Andy__lol: My theory on hero talents is that they designed hero talents to go to 30 points at level 100, where it will be a full on class skin by then. It will built on the system every expansion
[3:16:01] frankenfoot5: Do you think adding new trees would be the plan? Not adding more depth to the existing tree? I feel like every 8 years Blizz acknowledges system bloat, cuts back, vows to do better, then designs more and more systems
[3:16:02] SputnikTelevision: @TaliesinAndEvitel Are you gonna stream when the patch drops?
[3:16:07] dwolf010: I do think they are working on a rework of hero talents. as we havent seen more previews of the other hero talents
[3:16:09] picanhatv: they look like artifact talents, fun when filling it up and pretty much standard as you get to endgame stuff, flesh out ur class a lil more, fun stuff
[3:16:19] magisterofquelthalas: it is the covenant discussion again in a way?
[3:16:20] AtomJar: I would imagine they would add 10 extra talents on each tree for the next 3 expacs so by last titan there are 30 talent points
[3:16:20] zeckzeckzeck: they could've just expanded the existing tree and not called it hero talents and nothing would be different. and i'm fine with that
[3:16:21] Talieer: If I could choose between another rework of resto shaman talent tree and hero talents I'd pick another rework
[3:16:30] Xithraldor: there is probably a 'best' way to  play BG3 as well tho
[3:16:43] Thoreya: @zeckzeckzeck they in 2 expansions they would have an issue like the first talent tree iteration
[3:16:49] jiveyivey: Most people will just look up " Best Hero Talent build <insert Class>" And import that string
[3:16:54] Harai_Ulfsark: for midnight we'll get the netherlight crucible again ConcernDoge
[3:16:58] shawnomancy: Ironically, the audience who get the most choice out of talents are casuals.
[3:17:00] DylanTheBard: worse case the one you dont identify with is best in all content
[3:17:01] Dillogy: AT least BG3 you dont ahev to be with otehr people and can actually play suboptimally
[3:17:19] phopheter: look at the spell covenant changes they making to 10.2.5, in future they say we can go back so something of the sort is coming
[3:17:25] shawnomancy: You can pick the talents you want if you're just playing with friends and not going beyond follower dungeons or something.
[3:17:31] TaurusBerserk: so if you are fury and you pick mountain thane are you going to be able to tank?
[3:17:40] Harai_Ulfsark: @TaurusBerserk no
[3:17:44] zeckzeckzeck: no
[3:17:48] Dillogy: Itd be like having 2 of the artifacts to choice from per spec
[3:17:53] Sharktribe: I like that i will be able to play 2 fury warriors and have them feel different in gameplay in an even more pronounced sense than before hero talents
[3:17:59] DylanTheBard: that's the thing, if there was just one hero talent for each spec, like artifact weapons it would just solve everything
[3:18:02] ChappyAir: Good evening! Just an off topic question but when i turn on your stream you are always just chatting with the community (which I love, don’t get me wrong!). is there a chance of seeing you in actual gameplay from time to time? :)
[3:18:43] picanhatv: ngl, i dont see this talk outside of ur community, Tali, i think there is a bit of projection from what you wanted it to be, istead of what it is, i havent seen this being pointed out in other spaces, but i may be wrong
[3:18:44] frankenfoot5: @ChappyAir When servers are up Tali plays pretty often! Does M+ and all the stuff
[3:18:45] zeckzeckzeck: I do agree that there should at minimum be spell look changes and/or xmogs tied to the hero talents
[3:19:00] alextheblight: AA Fury is fun
[3:19:15] ChappyAir: @frankenfoot5 thanks! are they down right now? wanted to hop on wow later
[3:19:21] astralumi: AA fury is really fun, agree
[3:19:23] Sharktribe: Yeah read the rest of my comment, we agree : )
[3:19:50] HSAyril: Hey! He flew to the pond :P
[3:19:50] dat_rougarou: same, but for the new lightning hammers that match the transmog set from TWW
[3:19:53] The_Action_Man: Tali has done one or two streams where he's in a dungeon :)
[3:19:58] MeggoArt: i'm surprised that they haven't learned that cosmetic rewards are enough to get people to do content - if hero talents were just visuals people would be even MORE hyped
[3:19:59] Nulgar: tbh the name I have the least issues with - players get so upset over Fantasy terms, taking them too literally: "Hero" classes, World of "War"craft
[3:20:14] picanhatv: i feel like glyphs + mog rules would solve most of the cosmetic class fantasy issues tbh, and i dont think they warrant a expansion feature tag
[3:20:15] Erknost: Erknost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:20:19] frankenfoot5: The real reason we all turn into the stream is to get Tali to lift his shirt and reveal his tattoo
[3:20:28] astralumi: @MeggoArt trueee! i'd 100% be more hyped
[3:20:36] MrAxeffect: Jusr sounds like glyphs again
[3:20:38] witchhobbit: @picanhatv agreed
[3:20:44] kaijoe_: I bet more cosmetic bits will be added throughout alpha. But we’ll see.
[3:20:51] HSAyril: Yeah I can tell with Paladin, nothing really class themed with passing out weapons as a talent
[3:20:52] Valinor55: @frankenfoot5 isn't it a back tattoo with a windmill and something flying away?
[3:20:57] Talieer: hero fantasy: allow me to use 2 titles at the same time, 1 before and 1 after my name
[3:21:02] zeckzeckzeck: Anecdotally, I don't get the sense people are expecting more. At least not within my friends/guild
[3:21:10] bacudahh: Even if there are 10 different AoE Hero talents, there will always a best one and 99% of the ppl will pick it once they figure out whats best, I dont know how they could actually implement real class fantasy, I think there will always be a best build and almost everyone will run with that.
[3:21:19] DylanTheBard: do you think that during or after war within they'll change it so that the power and appearance are seperate?
[3:21:27] picanhatv: i feel this "people" are waaay more tali community thing, i dont see it ouside of here tbh
[3:21:47] zeckzeckzeck: spell look glyphs. so easy. do ittttttt
[3:21:57] zeckzeckzeck: make thunderclap, and fireclap, and windclap and
[3:22:06] Ojomon_: Well we’ve seen 4 of the trees already, so if people are expecting something more it’s on them. They literally showed us what they are
[3:22:15] bacudahh: Yeah, that's what they should do, everyone likes cosmetics anyway
[3:22:30] holyzeke: can I plz get a male spirt angel ffs ???
[3:22:31] CrankyPanzer: imagine a hero talent making fury warrior use sword and shield but damage stay the same
[3:22:40] astralumi: yesssssssss
[3:22:43] aragarde: my disappointment was in the race being another dwarf, means they'll add more of the same race just different traits.. but that's just my opinion
[3:22:44] zombaekittenx: hello !
[3:22:47] Saumur: Or, blizz, just look Taliesins video on Class Skins from a couple of years ago Kappa
[3:22:48] Aakku: as long as it doesn't break my macros lol
[3:22:51] caradosailanthus: And zero dev time needed for balancing cosmetics
[3:22:51] DozlaT: Yea imagine if you could be a wave shaman or whatever the kul titans are called
[3:22:53] Saumur: But for real, that video was great
[3:22:53] Valinor55: Didn't we somewhat have that back in the day..... what was it called that would change spell effects?
[3:22:56] chico_escuela: what we’d end up getting is a toy with a less shitty cooldown but it has zero customization.
[3:22:56] frankenfoot5: I'll be honest, all I want from War Within are dungeons that aren't as mechanically ridiculous as the Dragonflight ones. Legion/BFA was a pretty sweet spot
[3:23:00] zeckzeckzeck: TIdecaller instead of shaman
[3:23:02] zombaekittenx: tneWowkiller
[3:23:09] bacudahh: plus everyone will look different, which I think is really nice
[3:23:09] nadiaaa: make paladin spells blue so i can imagine it's moon power and i'd be happy LUL
[3:23:11] mattzomix: i want more timey wimey for my augwoker
[3:23:19] casztiel96: look to shadowlands for example number 1
[3:23:23] platy_dev: This gives me the vibes of when they added new passives as a "feature" in WoD
[3:23:24] Ghostsweeper: green fire was like the best thing theyve ever made
[3:23:28] witchhobbit: they def made it seem like something more than talents at the con and in videos but it is clear now
[3:23:28] astralumi: and in group content, if you choose a different option because of flavour, you run the risk of people flaming you for not picking the "bis" one
[3:23:30] alextheblight: true
[3:23:31] dwolf010: i just dont think they have the budget/artist to do it. cosmetic only requires so many more artists the current hero talents
[3:23:33] Dillogy: Idk, Imma pick what I think looks coolest either way
[3:23:50] alextheblight: and Kyrian/night fae effects (I want to play as Oath of the Ancients)
[3:23:58] alextheblight: paladin*
[3:24:00] MeggoArt: tali i'm so curious about your email i'll DM you to remind you tneNzothEye
[3:24:04] Valinor55: have a good evening Tali
[3:24:09] t4lco: My fear is that they make some Hero Talents just to "fill" some class/specs the community wants (like Bard), instead of doing proper Class/Specs. I think that's just lame tbh
[3:24:16] Nulgar: might also be a return of Challenge Modes
[3:24:22] aeson_of_raid_sock: get dinner
[3:24:23] frankenfoot5: Have a good evening, Tali! Thanks for the fun stream
[3:24:28] Trebled_Mind: CHEERIO!
[3:24:30] alextheblight: tneWineTime tneWineTime tneWineTime
[3:24:30] Rico_Azzarash: Bon appetit TALI! < 3
[3:24:30] MrScotticus: Have a great evening!
[3:24:32] thunduz: thanks for deciding to stream today
[3:24:36] Nagimitsu: Have a good night!
[3:24:41] alextheblight: have a good dinner and evening!
[3:24:46] Discordant_Hats: goodnight Tali and chat :)
[3:24:47] DylanTheBard: byee :)
[3:24:48] HSAyril: Nice chatting, Tali
[3:24:51] witchhobbit: toodles!!!
[3:24:52] Dillogy: Cya
[3:24:54] revan4686: night
[3:24:56] alextheblight: byeee
[3:24:58] thunduz: LOL
[3:24:58] lumaday: cheers
[3:24:59] alextheblight: oh god
[3:25:00] Eirianwen: Thx Tali
[3:25:01] astralumi: LOL
[3:25:02] DylanTheBard: ahhahaha
[3:25:05] HSAyril: Now queue the music
[3:25:06] revan4686: haha
[3:25:10] kittiezZ_: tneEvi
[3:25:10] Dillogy: Bruhhhhh what
[3:25:11] mydemoncat: lol
[3:25:13] Fraudchemist: there is a pen 15 in that!
[3:25:22] holyzeke: that tat gonna look amazing
[3:25:24] blumberquack: @Fraudchemist D: !
[3:25:26] magisterofquelthalas: omg that SS
