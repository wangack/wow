[2:02:42] enigmasvea: yes
[2:02:50] TheRealCunix: yeah
[2:02:52] MarkyOchoa: That's why High Warlords never slept
[2:02:54] Fargom: Yeah that's why taking a week off was catastrophic in the old grind style
[2:03:01] Miamor7: thats not cool....u had to play 16hours a day to keep ur HK
[2:03:19] hhhhalcyon: @Miamor7 at top ranks

[2:03:47] MarkyOchoa: I was in awe when I saw High Warlord
[2:03:49] Rookwurst: Is rank 3 highest in this phase?
[2:03:56] enzan69: @officialim No it wasn't. It takes no skill to spend 16 hours a day grinding av and to account share.
[2:03:57] Fargom: yes, 3 is max
[2:04:03] jporter_: you want rank 1 earthshock in pvp too?
[2:04:11] MarkyOchoa: I think 1st place will probably stay High Warlord, and the rest will just be Warlord
[2:04:12] BeeMcG: @shroud what is they add extra ranks like upto rank 18

[5:19:48] Xrudee: im guessing the HP gained from rockbiter makes it better pvp
[5:19:54] OhYeahitsKT: cracks flux pavilion remix is song name
[5:19:58] Lobe96: whats better Retail or Classic for beginner and intermediate
[5:19:59] rangerleet: @meozart never played path of exile but it looks promising
[5:20:07] genetic_lemon: Dance
[5:20:10] cleancutbruda: yea more options for sure for gearing rather than cookie cutter
[5:20:13] Daevilmonkiexp: @Lobe96 Retail, SoD is pretty easy ATM tho
[5:20:14] meozart: It is imo @rangerleet
[5:20:14] 5thD5thD: just sim it 4Head
[5:20:21] JakeStratic: The lack of knowledge and meta is fun
[5:20:22] VoylRL: It just makes it not figured out anymore
[5:20:23] TomShelby_: everything on classic is better than retail lets be honest here lol
[5:20:27] VoylRL: which is what makes it fun
[5:20:27] cleancutbruda: retail feels like blizz made my damn character lol
[5:20:28] Daevilmonkiexp: SoD makes classic easy
[5:20:29] irevxngee: the murloc boss is fun lol

[5:20:42] zen0vae: retail gameplay is pretty good, just everything else is bad
[5:20:49] DeebzTV: does not have the chin for that beard bruh
[5:20:51] Daevilmonkiexp: @TomShelby_ Sure, but they asked whats better for beginner/intermediate
[5:20:55] notfatdan: lol does shroud only play wow now
[5:21:01] eddym310: its prob already simmed up but its more fun to test
[5:21:02] ghiblic: basically saying retail has side effects from them simplifying everything and railroading a lot of things doing it
[5:21:05] meozart: Classic items feel like guys got high and threw darts at stats to go on items. And said send it
[5:21:11] hassanhannoun97: classic feels less bloated
[5:21:16] cleancutbruda: @zen0vae damage rotations are more "modern" in terms of difficulty
[5:21:45] Nosdunk24: retail sucks, except for the itemization, the dungeons, the raids, the gameplay and class rotations. But everything else sucks
[5:21:47] bdan_: there just two diff games, you dont always have to say ones better than the other LUL
[5:21:51] Daevilmonkiexp: @meozart It was very experimental at first, so i can see this lol
[5:21:57] TomShelby_: @Daevilmonkiexp retail just isnt wow anymore sadly
[5:22:11] OhYeahitsKT: PepoDance
[5:22:17] Nosdunk24: retail is just a much faster paced and more complex version of wow
[5:22:18] notfatdan: @TomShelby_ yes it is
[5:22:29] notfatdan: both are fun why do ppl have to be haters
[5:22:31] meozart: @daevilmonkiexp or one guy said man you can’t put strength armor on cloth and he said hold my fucking beer
[5:22:35] mastropiero9: :(
[5:22:39] Daevilmonkiexp: @TomShelby_ Oh i couldnt agree more man. my buds keep trying to get me back for it. not trying to grind to unlock micro gates on everything lol
[5:22:42] hassanhannoun97: I'd love it if feel classic had legendary items with usable abilities on them
[5:22:43] notfatdan: they are just diff games and fun for diff reasons lets just enjoy them both
[5:23:03] bdan_: exactly people just like to be haters lol
[5:23:03] notfatdan: @Daevilmonkiexp there isnt micro gates on anything tho lmfao
[5:23:08] cleancutbruda: classic is definitely more of an ARPG type of vibe which i like
[5:23:08] ovi95cod: ovi95cod subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[5:23:09] Nosdunk24: @Daevilmonkiexp huh? there is no grind required in retail
[5:23:13] kcept: what the biggest difference in classic and sod?
[5:23:21] Wibze: set a timer
[5:23:28] notfatdan: @Nosdunk24 yeah he hasnt even played it hes just saying words that make no sense
[5:23:31] mastropiero9: Who is the dummie reveal yourself
[5:23:35] siilver40: Try a timer
[5:23:36] omfgmartin: should work, just /reload
[5:23:42] bdan_: @Daevilmonkiexp gearing has never been easier in wow lmao
[5:23:51] Nosdunk24: @notfatdan lol yeah that makes sense. A lot of people say shit about retail when they haven't played in years lol
[5:23:56] BabuZ: / reload
[5:24:01] Daevilmonkiexp: You have to grind and unlock so much to catch up and play at max potential. Do 5 chapters of the campaign to unlock this specfic thing, add this to your gear and grind this for that
[5:24:08] Daevilmonkiexp: Yeah im good on retial
[5:24:10] bdan_: no you dont LUL
[5:24:10] meozart: Best way maybe is get healed and test on elites @shroud
[5:24:14] notfatdan: @Daevilmonkiexp that so far from the truth LOL
[5:24:15] BabuZ: reload
[5:24:22] Nosdunk24: @Daevilmonkiexp no of that is true
[5:24:24] Myatchh: @Daevilmonkiexp Except its not even close to like that anymore
[5:24:30] notfatdan: its actually way harder to just play the game in wrath or classic it takes 1 million years to get gear to raid
[5:24:37] smallfry503: lilies creamy choclate
[5:24:38] Daevilmonkiexp: If i wanted to pvp i cant just log in hit max level and pvp
[5:24:42] notfatdan: it takes less then a week to get 460 ilvl in retail to do +20s
[5:24:56] bdan_: @Daevilmonkiexp so ignorant
[5:25:00] Daevilmonkiexp: i have to do so much to be a contender with everyone else whos been playing and grinding shadowlands
[5:25:05] notfatdan: @Daevilmonkiexp you literally can tho lol
[5:25:05] siilver40: Not as many flurry procs with flametounge
[5:25:14] Myatchh: This dude is regurgitating classic andy propaganda about retail lmao
[5:25:21] Nosdunk24: classic wow is such a friggin grind its not even close to retail. Takes forever to do anything in classic
[5:25:22] bdan_: this dude still thinks its shadowlands LUL
[5:25:27] notfatdan: pvp gear is actually free in retail
[5:25:57] meozart: @daevilmonkiexp I would suggest looking into mouse over macros and learning to not break your rotation while moving
[5:25:59] Daevilmonkiexp: @notfatdan You have to do compaign stuff to unlock gear enhancements to be viable in pvp. you cant just get on and play at the same level everyone else is
[5:26:00] yardieirl: retail and wow andies arguing who waste more time.
[5:26:14] aarerts: rockbitter is better for now bc flametounge rank is way lower rn at 25
[5:26:31] irevxngee: can you try Flametongue MH  / Rockbiter OH
[5:26:32] jdev5: hi
[5:26:35] Myatchh: @Daevilmonkiexp You dont need to do the campaign for anything now. Havent since shadowlands.

[5:26:50] notfatdan: campaign is literally optional lol
[5:26:57] Nosdunk24: ignore him. he's just saying nonsense to get a rise outta people
[5:27:04] notfatdan: hes so cooked hes got no idea mods should ban him
[5:27:08] Dreamfl0w: I think right now the weapons with the most dps make the most sense since rockbiter is flat
[5:27:57] Datdota2: That was way faster
[5:27:58] TokerTy420: to slow
[5:28:13] PolyDanko: IS this classic?

[5:29:43] smallfry503: can i get inv to hero? name is lrddecay
[5:29:48] aarerts: you should use double rockbiter with magma burst since it scales with ap more and then use flametounge with lava lash and slower weapons
[5:29:56] walleyedtuna: @ReasonableDictator did she slob on the knob like corn on the cob?
[5:30:04] ttvgdrabbit: To the man in a wheelchair who stole my camouflage jacket, u can hide but u can't run
[5:30:04] localhost2090: !lvl

[5:30:42] Sleezinsrsly: @shroud it almost still makes sense to keep it, because the faster but weaker swings will crit more often and proc flurry more often than a less freequent larger crit
[5:30:43] smungleses: shroud are you feeling good
[5:30:45] ExDeeDardy: ya but if you have flurry up so much it doesnt matter if you are wasting flurry on off hand

[5:41:18] mothilium: same story for Hpala's
[5:41:18] DeebzTV: ty i was genuinly cirous
[5:41:19] Bonkeydoner: Whats does SOD stand for?
[5:41:20] DktrJ: hybrid dps will always be lower than pure dps class, but saying Shaman is crap is totally NPC thinking

[5:42:05] adabldooyah: DinoDance
[5:42:06] SanestNeet: 2010 Aware
[5:42:09] aittu4u: SP is not for pve really
[5:42:13] gonerforsure: will warr/pal have enough plate gear at 40 to compete with druid dire bear upgrade?
[5:42:13] Xrudee: did they find out if people could buy any loot with exalted WSG rep?
[5:42:19] Fossabot: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud

[5:42:29] borsko: chain lightning and chain heal at 40 are gonna make ele/resto way better
[5:42:31] Tazzasaurus: spriest are kinda good with homonculi for armor shred

[5:43:03] Kawjiryu: @shroud whats the best thing to do after hitting 25?
[5:43:03] delcortv: you can tell with the runes they gave they wanted tanking to shine
[5:43:04] delcortv: at 25
[5:43:12] reklebin: hope the next set of runes are passive runes
[5:43:13] jackx232: shamans get mail at 40 so they're gonna have more armor
[5:43:18] Youtube_Historian: Chain heal with overload is going to be nuts
[5:43:18] notColt45: Riptide would be nice
[5:43:20] Rio_TFF: healing rain + chain heal + earth shield
[5:43:25] itsrambo: The Horde general’s chain lightning will now hit up to 40 targets. ez

[5:44:28] zProgresso: zProgresso subscribed with Prime. 
[5:44:30] DeebzTV: @shroud thanks for clarifying mate
[5:44:33] JakeStratic: Heal more and bounce more is good but you can't SPAM chain heal because unless it is actually healing on all bounces it isn't mana efficient & vanilla healing is all about healing efficiency. @shroud \
[5:44:34] Baglio: I mean it’s the same in retail KEKG @ryuko198 shaman healing is chain heal simulator
[5:44:40] clockworkr3wind: this song kinda goin off

[5:44:53] Xrudee: did they find out if people could buy any loot with exalted WSG rep?
[5:44:59] SVANEf: @bigdurkos mounts is a Lvl 40 thing in classic
[5:45:03] MrHans07: @shroud what elvUI profile is this ?

[5:46:48] shwoopers: you know when shroud is hooked on a game when the facial hair starts to come out again
[5:46:52] BoscoDelMoral: how did you get the mount?
[5:47:02] JakeStratic: yes, in AOE fights you'll spam chainheal - but in non-aoe you spam healing wave. Shaman healing has an issue of a lack of meaningful diversity. More so than any other healing class... it is true.
[5:47:03] Sneaky261: @shroud Sorry brohow did u get mount?!
[5:47:11] MrSr3nity_97: @shroud Are you going to live stream The Game Awards tomorrow?

[5:51:12] JakeStratic: I'm not arguing with you. I'm partially disagreeing with you and responding. I agreed your suggested change to chain heal might be nice & shaman healers struggle with meaningful diversity. I am not wrong, no L's here.

[6:43:47] Avulsionn: they made the ashenvale mount friendly now i think
[6:43:50] omgbaph: turn it up shrooood
[6:43:54] Reckje: Ashenvale is still busted and crappy
[6:43:57] thedoodoty: Opposite approach to Diablo devs. Don’t nerf the fun classes into the ground; make the other classes fun to play too.
[6:43:59] soopatazz: they need to do something abt the ashenvale event its rough having to do all that running to only sometimes get rep
[6:44:01] gonerforsure: it's just.. less serious, especially after hc
[6:44:08] bilochita: good song

[6:44:40] KenM_in_FL: AlienDance
[6:44:40] C0smozero: all the other classes will scale better than they used to be but warrior is just going to dominate at the end of the day this is my bet
[6:44:54] KuddaKillz31: Are there assistive apps for WoW?
[6:44:56] gigaton_punch: wouldnt you just want the burst

[6:45:55] shadowkhancmp: oom af
[6:45:56] C0smozero: @Shurys right now tho its not the case, if anything they will scale much better than they used to be
[6:46:17] petergriffin092: @ItsNachtt wtdym with good place ?
[6:46:46] gonerforsure: i think ewlynn forest is a pretty good place to start
[6:46:58] Chaoticsaur: warrior being op is fine as long as stuff like ret is functional
[6:46:59] paazx: yeah, buff others instead of nerfing the one on top
[6:47:05] Shurys: if warriors domiate like 10% better than the other classes, i think it is okay
[6:47:08] C0smozero: as a warrior main i have no issue, more for us KEKW
[6:47:13] smallfry503: I think warriors should do a little less dps if not tanking
[6:47:15] Iratic: i think they need to up the level bracket so that rogue has a bit more utility to tank
[6:47:27] minispiderrr: SHROUD man play valorant or something -_-
[6:47:31] C0smozero: its good

[7:09:16] hookjolton: isnt headsplitter better from SM trash?
[7:09:19] predac0n: Is it really worth min/maxxing at 25 tho? The gear is only going to become outdated
[7:09:36] AK_ttv_: @shroud u always be on the World of Warcraft grind that's real
[7:09:50] heilsnuffe: If u wanna own now
[7:09:54] levirman304: Ipm

[7:10:02] itsrambo: lul
[7:10:02] sayatheslaya: @predac0n gear always gets outdated lmao, is it ever worth it to minmax by that logic?
[7:10:16] hasan3p: are you excited for THE DAY BEFORE? @shroud
[7:10:25] predac0n: @sayatheslaya Not in this case because the game is never going to progress past 60
[7:10:27] probsstoned: rfk trash is decent
[7:10:29] LeWipzor: didnt see SM yet
[7:10:33] POOFMORE: min maxing is fun
[7:10:35] earltotoro: making gold is the best minmaxing rn
[7:10:39] adabldooyah: Is your playlist somewhere on the youtubes or the spotify
[7:10:41] itsrambo: sm is on
[7:10:41] Koshintu: could use the same logic each retail expansion though
[7:10:42] Digitalguns: always fun to pop in every 3months to watch shroud do whatever he’s doing.
[7:10:43] YuzukiKaze: plinK
[7:10:44] Molgrainee: mid max is fun tho
[7:10:47] sayatheslaya: min maxing is literally the only thing to do right now lmfao
[7:10:53] Tempuren: SM is prob turned off cuz its gonna be a raid at 40
[7:10:53] paazx: its a 2 month phase right ?
[7:10:57] Pr3pared: twink min max is fun
[7:11:02] itsrambo: SM is turned on and gnomer is the raid @Tempuren
[7:11:03] Pr3pared: some of the best pvp imo
[7:11:05] TheRealBowser: @shroud will you be trying the once human beta? :)
[7:11:08] predac0n: that's why I rolled Mage first i'm just gonna AOE farm gold until my eyes bleed
[7:11:11] Someone426: (ditto)
[7:11:15] Koshintu: definitely
[7:11:23] ArcaneSyntax: I did a level 32 quest for a mail helmet LUL
[7:11:25] gambleragain: if you dont min max you're just a cheap F*ck that's trying to justify not min maxing
[7:11:33] sayatheslaya: ye its grinding for thegear thats the fun part for me
[7:11:39] sayatheslaya: once im bis I get bored
[7:11:43] DBtheAlien: !server
[7:11:43] Fossabot: @DBtheAlien, Both SoD characters (Horde Orc Shaman/Alliance Pally) are on the Crusader Strike Server
[7:11:49] Krelivane_: Gear upgrades are hard to feel and gauge in retail though. Classic progression is way more impactful
[7:12:08] Flekz127: did he get any items from the raid before?
[7:12:08] Diisplaced: think its better to get a few 25s and see what everything is like, the class you will be playing at 60 will most likely be completely different from the one at 25
