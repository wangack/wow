[0:58:03] dreamybull_4real: @Savix gotta buy a layer swap from Blizzard Store. Its lame but best way to swap layer.
[0:58:05] bliz0th: the solution requires coding, which requires someone to do it. Which requires for him to get paid. Nah we can't have that Savix savixSmile

[1:01:29] Tikrowstoqn: @savix they have to make it so if you arein a group
[1:01:36] Tikrowstoqn: you stay in the same layer
[1:01:41] jtstroud: 100%
[1:01:43] jtstroud: agree
[1:01:47] jtstroud: but then i ask
[1:01:54] jtstroud: why tf isnt it like that already
[1:01:56] Spengatron: Hey @Savix I won an auction earlier for really cheap and the person selling it messaged me saying they made a mistake, would you give it back? the buyout was high but the bid started low.
[1:01:57] jtstroud: and how long til it is
[1:02:18] アシェス: @spengatron u dont ask other people just do what u feel is right
[1:02:20] afraidanuffin: Wonder why random layers instead of prioritizing the lowest population layer. Migrate entire groups together?
[1:02:42] Snackybox: the games the game
[1:02:45] Deadge_Gartic: @Spengatron low bid is a scam
[1:02:47] Deadge_Gartic: dont feel bad

[1:03:03] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix nah this feels like he made a low bid scam and forgot to cancel
[1:03:04] andyl0l: If they put bid low it's their fault. Just say you used it already GIGA
[1:03:05] jtstroud: survival of the not dumb
[1:03:05] bliz0th: I'm with deadge in this one
[1:03:06] Deadge_Gartic: he deserves
[1:03:27] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix nah this feels like he made a low bid scam and forgot to cancel , people do that to put their action on top
[1:03:34] Tropicocity: to have a super low bid you have to manually input it and not just autopost with undercut
[1:03:35] Yakku_: you should find the boss for blood boost mate @Savix
[1:03:39] bliz0th: that's right
[1:03:39] Spengatron: Lol thanks guys i just kinda felt bad
[1:03:41] jtstroud: 8 minutes just to get group layered together great event blizzard
[1:03:44] アシェス: rip xyrex

[1:07:03] bwomsam: @Curtsy talking about the general feeling of the game
[1:07:05] neko4200222: i think whats going on is when you layer the one your in is low pop ok but when you invite to a full layer or maxed out layer it breaks the party up bug when it changes your layer to a lower pop
[1:07:07] jtstroud: literally unplayable in a group
[1:07:17] Unframed_: yeah its unplayable now
[1:07:21] jtstroud: it was fine just laggy early on

[1:27:13] K4nata_: yes
[1:27:15] echoloch: Yup P2 is feeling like a miss
[1:27:17] adam_brisbane: The difference is the old system was struggling because they were layering raid groups of 40 now there are only smaller groups of 5 so should be able to revert back
[1:27:29] insaniacc_: @Savix Aggrend said they are pushing a fix early next week to keep groups on the same layer reliably 󠀀
[1:27:30] Deadge_Gartic: i think if p2 is not a fast phase it will be bad for the games health LULW

[1:28:12] Weedweed: Blizzard has to hire a team to work on classic since all fired 2 weeks ago to pump Microsoft stock price
[1:28:20] mysteriousm4n: and yes p1 had the same problem near the end
[1:28:27] Murkyx: next week WOW

[1:31:31] 3Brick_: @Savix what would happen if i am a 1 viewer streamer and that 1 viewer farms gold and gives me 200g? do you think that will trigger the ban system?
[1:31:33] baril47: agi +3
[1:32:07] Judeese: Did i miss gnomer?
[1:32:30] 1teuzin: male
[1:32:32] insaniacc_: I think if you get gold from a person who was flagged as RMTer, you get banned, regardless of amount
[1:32:33] Byshash: @savix did you see a pala rank 4 dps on last boss? https://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/2008#dpstype=dps&boss=2940

[1:33:01] Karzhan: show sword
[1:33:18] Xyvez: @Savix you give too much credit to blizzard on how they determine the gold trade lol. i wont be surprised if its as simple as "big amount? ban/warning"
[1:33:52] blushy: Thats why my wifes 3rd boyfriend trades through the auction house
[1:34:08] insaniacc_: do you think they banned GDKPs to find RMTers easier. Because GDKPers used to send gold cuts also LULW
[1:34:30] msmester1: np thats the other gigachad quest
[1:34:45] Xyvez: They cant even fix the layering how they suppose to figure out fair ban on gold mailing/trading lol
[1:34:50] msmester1: kiting the big dragons is so much fun
[1:34:58] 3Brick_: @Savix so if you join a gold selling guild and they say "Good work champion of "IChellGuld" we are rewarding you with 500g, GZ" that wouldnt trigger the system?
[1:35:20] 1teuzin: gdkp attracts a lot of gold sellers and buyers
[1:35:32] Deadge_Gartic: some people join gdkps to sell gold also
[1:35:38] Deadge_Gartic: its bad for game health
[1:35:49] Endy253: No... There's one guy who brings in an honest 15-20g. Against 9 rmt

[1:45:19] Norcore: but you have to twist seals
[1:45:30] andyl0l: he seal of martyrdom on his dmg breakdown so must be why he's not using storm?
[1:45:32] LILSyuto: because alot of people like the fantasy. Its only above average ppl who dont like it @Deadge_Gartic
[1:45:32] SuperLost89: i was playing a holy shock build and it was kinda wild in regards to dps

[1:47:28] Deadge_Gartic: @LILSyuto atm its effecting even normal raiding and making people toxic , only counter arguement i see is people doing world content liking the spell existing
[1:47:32] brock_bahma: Joe Biden called
[1:47:34] chickenbaggins: LIZUN
[1:47:37] Deadge_Gartic: that shouldnt matter for them anyway since it still exists

[1:48:46] LILSyuto: @Deadge_Gartic But its just not, also as per blizzard the biggest playerbase barely does lfr. So removing something thats fun for the biggest playerbase is just not the move jsut so people cann degen over a few %. And it also doesnt turn anything toxic at all
[1:48:51] HogBaby: HogBaby subscribed with Prime.

[1:50:05] LILSyuto: @Deadge_Gartic You asbolutely misunderstood what i wrote apparently and its not a group cd for the most part of the game. It does because they like buffing others...

[3:20:03] aSteamedTomato: @Savix the most hilarious type of tank atm is hunter tank. If you go for armor pieces and stamina, you end up at like 4.3-4.5k hp, 45% DR and 40+% avoidance. Horde only, though, as you need a shaman to buff you with Spirit of the Alpha
[3:20:12] misomander: permission to sit sir
