[0:39:06] tvilk: input delay means much less in a game like wow compared to games like CS
[0:39:32] tvilk: you can play perfectly fine with 100ms in wow, meanwhile in shooters if you have 20ms you're gonna feel it

[1:04:02] boogagamingtv: that should be fixed
[1:04:07] boogagamingtv: shiv should be like 15 sec max
[1:04:14] boogagamingtv: like hunter and druid sooth as they are 10
[1:04:35] DjinDjarinTTV: morning everyone
[1:04:38] DjinDjarinTTV: morning scripe
[1:04:51] assrug: i think they should remove it rogue already too much utility
[1:05:04] boogagamingtv: that is signature for rogues
[1:05:24] assrug: that is an explanation but no excuse
[1:05:33] astharoshe4: do you normally play alone?
[1:05:36] boogagamingtv: also they have only 1 thing that benefits the group all the time that is the poison dr
[1:05:45] tvilk: @astharoshe4 he's not playing alone, he's playing with @mohaso21
[1:05:55] astharoshe4: ohhh I see, thank you
[1:06:06] alishoop: did you want a 28 WCM earlier?
[1:06:07] tvilk: and then pugging people who 99% are from stream
[1:06:07] assrug: boogagamingtv we get it u a rogue main but they still have too much stuff not point in even arguing
[1:07:13] mohaso21: hell no we are not
[1:07:33] astharoshe4: @tvilk it's nice to see people who can do 28s and 29s, the highest key for me has been a 25 T_T
[1:08:29] assrug: astharoshe4 thats only 4 levels lower you definetly can get there if you want
[1:09:10] astharoshe4: but the knowledge of the key and the timings are very difficult for me. Also I think the dps I do is low
[1:09:14] tvilk: to me it's more about being able to mentally sustain playing with pugs at that level.. I cannot
[1:09:42] assrug: nah pugging is very stupid
[1:09:50] assrug: don't do it
[1:10:10] astharoshe4: I prefer a premade for sure
[1:10:57] boogagamingtv: i feel yall lads  , i pug from S4 BFA when i came back to the game after 4 years of break , and from then i only pug :D doing 28-29 keys is scary af pugging
[1:11:06] boogagamingtv: also getting into key takes like 2 hours :D
[1:11:09] Tobbler131: go play league and CS and build ur mental if u cant deal with pugging LUL
[1:11:36] noobishnerd: yo chat does scripe play mage when hes not raid leading in rwf?
[1:11:38] assrug: it's not about mental, it's about waste of time
[1:11:49] astharoshe4: league won't bring you mental capacity haha I think you will go insane

[1:11:54] Tobbler131: But bro gaming is waste of time LUL
[1:12:04] RichardPPPan: HUH
[1:13:51] assrug: if you pug there is a 99% chance someone in the group depletes the key to something you already learned and high chance you deplete the key to something they already learned, it's very frustrating and inefficient, you are basically waiting for stars to align
[1:14:18] assrug: much butter in premade where you can jsut flame healer for everythign imo
[1:14:34] RichardPPPan: essaying
[1:14:51] Tobbler131: and probably 98% of those chance are you?
[1:15:18] assrug: yeah ok you are all puging 29 keys fwith great success im sure LUL
[1:15:27] Nightbot: LUL

[1:16:31] Hozzar1: @tvilk because he's the ceo of echo
[1:16:40] LuiBMHunter: it's all the empty space between his headphones :)

[1:19:06] oblanda: Deadge
[1:19:16] assrug: Tobbler131 yeah ok, it's not clear i guess i meant if it's not your group depleting the key to something you already learned it's yourself depleting the key to something your group already learned

[1:23:21] nimmiemage: bl
[1:24:27] assrug: Tobbler131 I guess, for me avoiding that and progressing as a team (faster) is alot more fun and I think it would be for alot of people if they would overcome the initial burde of finding a group / making friends in the game.
[1:24:38] assrug: But to each his own.
[1:24:45] RichardPPPan: :essau

[2:24:16] mohaso21: all was fine
[2:24:17] Chimix1: I have suggestion for mohaso, you should pull maiden pack to keeper pack and not other way around, because casters were now lacking behind
[2:25:25] nadgob93: i mean you gorup first 2 casters with kicks and then you silence sigil so the 2 casters from the back come to maiden
[2:26:55] mohaso21: ye i fully forgot about those 2
[2:28:13] Chimix1: mobs have frontal that you wanna dodge
[2:28:25] Chimix1: yea
[2:28:33] mohaso21: ye thats what i do but mobs move weirdly still and i also have to dodge frontals and keepers shit on the ground and storming
[2:29:13] destrostoo: He should use his sigil of chains to move the mobs onto orb always
[2:30:59] mohaso21: ye i do that on cd
[2:34:23] mystralwastaken: Aug is also kinda nice
[2:34:30] mystralwastaken: 4% baseline hp
[2:34:32] AmosDaragorn: 4%
[2:35:02] BenvyTV: yo scripe , what do u think about the four dps at 4 eb at mdi
[2:35:04] mystralwastaken: and they have the Aspect's Favor whenever
[2:35:10] BenvyTV: you don't thnik it's to risky ?
[2:35:17] kouradas1: what aug brings is a nice buffer between boosted healers and death

[2:36:05] mohaso21: its not you
[2:36:07] mohaso21: its me
[2:36:08] mohaso21: and the healer
[2:36:38] mohaso21: evoker helps so much with their shields and shit
[2:36:48] tvilk: I mean on paper you just are safer with evoker.. Aug has group utility, group defensives and boost tank survivability + healer's healing.. the question is just is it being utilized
[2:36:52] mohaso21: also never do  mass sheep again
[2:38:33] mystralwastaken: Do the "Emphasize on me" as well
[2:38:39] mystralwastaken: helps a ton
[2:42:43] alishoop: hmm
[2:42:49] Fotonio22: what wa wonderful start Kappa
[2:42:58] alishoop: was it storming?
[2:43:32] mohaso21: thats not on me
[2:43:44] LuiBMHunter: It's always the mage's fault ... :)
[2:43:58] Fotonio22: mage fault Kappa
[2:44:04] alishoop: i had the same issue in another key cos storming knocked them out of the ring
[2:44:08] LuiBMHunter: :D
[2:44:23] marsagoxd: ngl in hindsight anyone should soak that, and you had blink
[2:45:25] tvilk: the damage from the soak is nothing.. never expect others to soak it
[2:45:29] mohaso21: ye you think i wasn't dealing with shit with all these mobs on me? XD
[2:45:34] Fotonio22: not sure tank can soak with adds on him
[2:45:49] alishoop: i blame gingi for this tbh
[2:45:57] tvilk: tbh yeah same, typical gingi
[2:46:01] Fotonio22: just blame healer / tank and move on Kappa
[2:46:37] tvilk: yapping again shifting blame
[2:46:57] mohaso21: i get it when its closer to me but when its in a shit spot with million mobs on me with the potential of hitting me on my back then i can't do it

[4:27:31] foggyfr: pretty sure half there shit is disabled in arenas for this reason exactly
[4:28:37] NasDa_: why do you lock your fps at 60?
[4:28:42] mohaso21: trying to check and i will let you know
[4:29:25] insecurity0509: locking frame to 60fps is usually to stop any excess page tearing on the viewing device.
[4:29:34] foggyfr: huge
[4:30:04] NasDa_: vertical sync?
[4:30:10] insecurity0509: V-synch
[4:30:28] harlyseraphim: vsync
[4:30:35] insecurity0509: that too lol
[4:30:42] harlyseraphim: top option
[4:30:54] insecurity0509: you have vsync on
[4:30:56] harlyseraphim: but it could be that u set it to 60 in windows

[4:35:33] mohaso21: ending up in m+ echo team  next expansion
[4:35:50] insecurity0509: tip for people using AMD cards - if you get weird graphics lag in wow or fps drops turn off/disable low latency mode in gfx settings. :)
[4:36:50] NasDa_: you really should try 2k monitor especially with your UI havinig so much information. It's night and day.
[4:37:10] NasDa_: STARFORCE PC can handle it
[4:37:15] NasDa_: FORGE*

[4:54:07] Smokeonetv: lag
[4:54:43] mohaso21: @bingo_roswell ye i noticed that , but i will get the hang of it the more dungeons i play and i know how to play around the pulls .. it just needs practice
[4:55:37] bingo_roswell: keep bone shield up and dancing rune weapon and you’ll be good to go
[4:56:33] mohaso21: bingo_roswell ye i mean i dinged 70 on it and timed 20 on the same day already xd i'll get the hang of it .. but its what you said yeah

[8:22:24] Dissperia: @alishoop been unlucky getting 31 keys, he has x5 and i have x1, so it would be fairly easy to overtake him if RNG is blessed getting the right key
[8:23:08] alishoop: @Dissperia yeah trouble is it's his job (kinda) so he's got infinite time to get the right keys Kappa

[8:59:09] DaBerry573: lets ask jb
[8:59:22] natty: it's a bit cringe
[8:59:25] dreamlessLKY: i like it because maybe the devs will take a hint the healer role sucks in keys and needs to be made important
[8:59:33] daddy_lagger: i think keys lvl need to be increased :)
[8:59:35] natty: just like how all the class stacking was cringe
[9:00:02] Nocturne118: Some classes have way too much personnals
[9:00:08] sintech1349: i mean scripe to be fair, your guys are always big brains... its not showing only in Raid but also in mdi
[9:00:11] natty: especially shadow and ret
[9:00:14] natty: warlock is just warlock
[9:00:15] tassdingo44: Boomkin needs more
[9:00:17] Zeppe899: are there any restrictions at all with mdi?

[9:08:34] taru_lifts: still incredible that they 4 dps'd this
[9:08:37] charlesk27: what an upset
[9:08:48] jurashh: feels like they just did less damage because they had to heal a lot or something
[9:08:50] oblanda: the healer dps carried
[9:08:50] SensoNo: you're hiding boss % hp

[9:09:35] taru_lifts: @dreamlessLKY ret and sp gimping dps a little for survival/sustain
[9:09:43] Cadalos: healer stress reducing factor
[9:09:55] freeederikke: @Scripe Can you move your cam slighty up? its covering boss health
[9:10:09] notabes: Soda and sjele were doing like 600k-1kk dps each, just because they didn't have to care too much about survivability
[9:10:11] Artem_V: 4dps comps proved inferior
[9:10:40] natty: just so much more dps from dawg's dps

[9:30:48] druggie12: omg thjis ad
[9:31:11] Dissperia: its around 30%
[9:31:11] jurashh: 30
[9:31:12] natty: at like 30%
[9:31:42] natty: but even without that i think dawgs caught up
[9:31:48] yolles: 33-41
[9:31:49] yolles: ye
[9:31:50] Eliannoula: got hp twice
[9:31:50] natty: it healed 10% i think
[9:31:54] ECRexx92: 8%
[9:31:55] Dissperia: 33 - 37 - 41
[9:31:56] juggerdinn: 10%
[9:31:59] yolles: 33 to 41
[9:32:03] Pechorin333: which mobs did they bring? the ones right outside the vine-gate before yalnu?
[9:32:05] marsagoxd: yes holy thats allot
[9:32:10] natty: ye @Pechorin333
[9:32:11] yolles: 8%
[9:32:13] juggerdinn: which was definitely the loss
[9:32:36] Lorrdzik: even without healing they could have lost
[9:32:37] natty: the sanguine wasnt the loss
[9:32:43] natty: they still lose without it
[9:32:59] SalmiraMH: Echo lost even without sanguine healing
[9:32:59] Dissperia: the boss has a 300% dmg amp because of how much hp it has
[9:33:05] Arkismall: Had to be cd timing for the vuln when add dies.
[9:33:08] Lorrdzik: +5 sec dead for Echo
[9:33:16] Nicvond01: what is the exploit in everbloom that was used on +30 keys?
[9:33:25] Nicvond01: it was talked about earlier
[9:33:33] KASTAA: stinger mind control
[9:33:42] natty: you could MC a mob
[9:33:46] natty: but it got hotfixed

[9:34:30] Sathyron: at least we get to see another Round of Echo Games today Pog
[9:34:31] reily47: who is in dawgs?
[9:34:37] Shadelikee: I think echo should've had that rogue you played with on EB
[9:34:39] nggobi: Sjele and Drjay just did more damage than Gingi and Clickz, and Soda did more then Meeres. Crazy how the boss just disappeared.
[9:34:40] zappybo1: i can hear gingi desk slamming from here
[9:34:40] natty: dawg
[9:34:45] rzz433: velo diff
[9:34:52] notabes: sjele is one crazy warlock though, don't forget that
[9:34:52] DrCitron_: echo got 90M sanguin compare to 30M on dawgs side
[9:34:58] SmokeyPumkin: kick velo KEKW
[9:35:10] yolles: @notabes so is clickz
[9:35:13] SmokeyPumkin: ye
[9:35:14] natty: @DrCitron_ a big part of that was probably the water thatt dawgs used
[9:35:17] Dissperia: if MDT is right and the boss has 345m hp, it healed for around 34.5m hp which is a lot
[9:35:21] natty: but echo gained time there
[9:35:31] DrCitron_: echo will probably be the last match of today
[9:35:31] KiwiGuy17: So Echo still has a chance ?
[9:35:34] Pechorin333: what exactly was the water doing again?
[9:35:39] Bigums: when was the last time sjele and jay were on the same team together
[9:35:41] Sepherine: Legendary is "technically" Echo too xD
[9:35:44] natty: stops sanguine from healing @Pechorin333
[9:35:45] DrCitron_: @natty oh didn't know it affect sanguin to
[9:35:47] nggobi: Damn good runs, this is exactly what makes it fun to watch. Two insane teams!
[9:35:52] juggerdinn: generally echo dps seemed a lot higher
[9:35:53] Arkismall: It was the plot to wait for NA to get dropped to lower bracke ttoo, and then Echo sends them home.
[9:36:07] Ullersss: that Rogue u played with in Everbloom earlier would have carries that key for Echo @Scripe  :D
[9:36:44] druggie12: see drjay from 10m to 40m in like 10 sec
[9:37:00] druggie12: he flied on damage
[9:37:14] Dissperia: 64m healing is the difference between the two
[9:37:26] fleks27: yo scripe did you know its intentional echo went lower bracket so they can eliminate NA themselfs after legendary knocks them into lower bracket? did you cook that up?
[9:37:27] Hallibell365: yeye blame the non echo raider :P
[9:37:31] SmokeyPumkin: u need to talk to them :P
