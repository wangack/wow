[1:09:32] uytm1: whats the benifit of a double transpose?
[1:09:43] gh3tt0gh0st: @uytm1 More dmg.
[1:09:54] ray_314: you skip the weak fire 3 and bliz 3
[1:09:54] Carbonidex: RPR died its joever
[1:10:05] gh3tt0gh0st: Ice skills on BLM do a bit less dmg, fire do more. With double transpose you get more fire spells off.
[1:10:25] uytm1: wouldnt u lose the 3 hearts?
[1:10:46] Bluecloudee: not just ice spells f3 is also one of the weakest
[1:11:00] Bluecloudee: skip the weakest spells in your list
[1:11:06] NaturalNarwhal: @uytm1 you do but its a gain overall
[1:11:09] Fabiruchix: fppongSit Û†ÄÄ
[1:11:16] theslayer6445: classic still running through the middle
[1:11:17] ray_314: you don't lose it, you just don't gain it from bliz 5 so thats another weak spell skipped
[1:12:38] gh3tt0gh0st: Pog
[1:13:54] xanfer: i think its a gain, at least compared to standard
[1:14:04] ray_314: double transpose is not free movement, it is a gain at the cost of movement
[1:14:08] NaturalNarwhal: comparing full uptime skipping ice is always a gain
[1:14:23] NaturalNarwhal: and is more expensive on movement resources
