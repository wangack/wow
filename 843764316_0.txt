[1:22:06] CrunkyBrewster: i get spider eyes when i try to tank
[1:22:19] the_grim_gamer_445: in threads of fates defense. at least leveling ain't repititive. which is problem now. in vanilla not so much since there were many paths. but nowadays. it's very linear. and for a guy like me who has 7 alts to maintain. it's very convenient.
[1:22:33] Artivicii: im still inbetween legion and shadowlands for best dungeons
[1:22:34] CrunkyBrewster: @AwesomeTrey7 yes very much agreed there
[1:22:37] Doohzyy: legion m+ was really fun
[1:23:00] CrunkyBrewster: AwesomeTrey7 my only gripe with it is objectives take forever to do. i think they need tweaking a bit
[1:23:06] zaazita: i liked bfa KappaPride
[1:23:11] Artivicii: as bad of a rep seat of the triumvirate had, it was one of the best dungeons ive seen
[1:23:24] Nehcrom: Heresy, buuurn the witch!
[1:23:25] the_grim_gamer_445: @crunkutv maybe. but ultimately threads of fate was a really good idea.
[1:24:04] zaazita: and legion ofc
[1:24:45] indiegarona: The first boss is the suckiest.
[1:24:58] the_grim_gamer_445: I liked legion. bfa was crap. but in bfas defense. it wasn't the worst. the worst was ofc wod.
[1:25:56] Artivicii: im digging some of these tyrannical fights

[2:33:00] indiegarona: I made my holy priest one, holding off on disc leggo because I don't yet have access to the best memory.
[2:33:20] EvoCyberNation: I'm hearing some horror stories @jure__ . The monitor is extremely sturdy and built well. I'm just getting on and off flickering lights.
[2:33:38] EvoCyberNation: I kne w something wasn't right. I had to do the research. Dell failed
[2:33:41] blazenx416: burn that bastard
[2:33:56] jure__: @EvoCyberNation yea, when you have flickering then cable should be the first thing you try to change

[2:38:31] indiegarona: It's NEVER the priest's fault.
[2:38:36] indiegarona: Priests are innocent.
[2:38:38] Tessiuz: priest def pulled :)
[2:38:44] indiegarona: Hey!
[2:38:46] Viscule: Priest got too close and pulled
[2:38:53] blazenx416: when casters tank
[2:39:08] Artivicii: the demon hunter CC was supposed to help him through 4Head
[2:39:23] Mah1tu: wow
[2:39:28] Viscule: Imprison also doesn't aggro anything

[2:44:59] jure__: unless someone misses the javelin
[2:45:01] Artivicii: devos is just dont miss pear
[2:45:04] ambiotic: these angels are harder than devos
[2:45:04] Grunton: its more of a healing boss
[2:45:06] indiegarona: As a healer, I super appreciate a tank who knows how to position and has amazing situational awareness and he does both.
[2:45:14] Artivicii: miss spear*
[2:45:40] thatoneredguyoverthere: I think one of the harder bosses, is the second boss of Sanguine Depths, regular groups completing it is just near impossible
[2:45:43] DudeThatsDope: @Towelliee 100% agree, best mythic to run
[2:45:46] 2chest_1head: @Towelliee but easier than Normal Lady Inerva Darkvein in Nathria? Lol
[2:45:48] NplusK: It’s def hard to heal
[2:46:01] indiegarona: Depends on the healer class
[2:46:50] indiegarona: I use mass dispel on this fight and it gets infinitely easier.
[2:47:10] 元気: wait how do u spawn a prideful like that

[2:56:25] indiegarona: do shadow priests have mass dispel?
[2:56:35] mooncaster2034: yes
[2:56:59] indiegarona: @jure__ I have been swapping between disc and holy depending on the instance. This one I run holy, and with my legendary, conduit and talent combo, I am always great on mana.
[2:57:12] indiegarona: Disc mana is a bit more finicky.
[2:57:29] jure__: @Indiegarona yea my disc priest friend is always oom
[2:57:31] acuass: is he mounted casting spells?
[2:57:35] blazenx416: seems bs as you are actually hitting her
[2:57:45] grizzlyhorn: @acuass paladin horse lmao
[2:58:00] acuass: the priest
[2:58:09] indiegarona: @jure__ It really comes down to managing atonement. It's changed so much over the years. If you find yourself constantly casting Radiance on cooldown, you go oom fast.

[3:20:27] Decoyszn: No tank spec should ever have that much off healing, protection, and damage. How do you NOT think it’s broken?
[3:20:28] indiegarona: @nargathronic nope.
[3:20:29] Artivicii: prot has been in arena pvp meta for a long while now
[3:21:07] indiegarona: @ItsDecoySZN I mean, that all changed when Blizz decided to give every player of every spec, everything. I've come to terms with it.
[3:21:09] Artivicii: second wind was probably the worst of it
[3:21:34] Decoyszn: Right, but realistically they shouldn’t allowing queuing as these specs
[3:21:35] EvonuX: if you were ret you would have probably died already
[3:21:48] Artivicii: or wouldve killed the other guy
[3:21:55] Artivicii: ret is strong in arena rn
[3:21:59] nuggetmcgrubbins: what name plates is he using ??
[3:22:01] EvonuX: true
[3:22:02] Decoyszn: This isn’t pvp, that’s the problem. It takes the arena aspect out of arena.
[3:22:05] indiegarona: @ItsDecoySZN So you want prot pallies banned from PvP...
[3:22:16] EvonuX: any prot spec @Indiegarona
[3:22:19] Decoyszn: I want anything tank banned, yes. You shouldn’t tank in arenas
[3:22:22] indiegarona: yipes
[3:22:29] blazenx416: get em
[3:22:34] blazenx416: MONSTER
[3:22:52] Decoyszn: You genuinely think it’s healthy for arena gameplay to have tanks?
[3:23:07] bvbdragon: could spam every wow dev with this vod , still not nerfed earlier than 2 months
[3:23:09] Artivicii: bring back legion second wind KEKW

[3:23:32] Qoax: More like support
[3:23:35] Decoyszn: It’s just SO much damage AND so much protection lol
[3:23:48] blazenx416: basic tanks aren't gonna do to well people just don't like good tanks
[3:23:54] Alaquane: 2 piece trinket gives bonus versatility I think, but yeah, ilvl is king

[4:27:24] rocthenite: i think the diffences with sl and cata difacultly is SL is hard due to misstuning with other factors at lunch like squich and gear design, cata was hard becuase of the "make heroics, heroics" movement from tb's followers
[4:27:40] MrGattz: i mean sure after this bet we can do a bet on the bg

[4:39:55] lanara233: If they don't like the product, I think you could argue they're selling out
[4:39:59] tkbrummett: There are a lot of viewers who get way too invested in "their" streamers lives
[4:40:05] rocthenite: the same people who also think twitch is domanated by girl gamer streamers

[4:44:49] ThunderWaffuL: new mmo on the horizon?
[4:44:50] rohdey: they never stated the MMO was an 'RPG' could be anything
[4:44:52] Luthercorpz: League MMO will be fun
[4:44:59] blightanker: what key is this?
[4:45:16] MethmM: The problem is making a different mmo with a different concept that is also interesting.
[4:45:23] Akoudadis: They gonna make Wildstar 2.0! with League lore etc.
[4:45:31] Umoran: @Towelliee well a wow clone in different universe with lots of people digging it , is not a bad thing.
[4:45:35] blightanker: aa
[4:45:45] Headass97: Simp
[4:45:49] rocthenite: like all riot need to do is get combat feel amazing
[4:45:50] MethmM: how long did wildstar last?

[4:46:32] Ascendor81: I dont play with people that were in my first guild in 2005, but they are all still online in WoW, on different servers and still play WoW.
[4:46:41] tkbrummett: Riot MMO is the only thing i can see standing a chance
[4:46:43] BoezIRL: and they make good games
[4:46:45] JustAwaay: at least 2
[4:46:52] viopoppinoff: I'd like to play both.
[4:47:02] uglla3np: it doesnt scale up like that even for big companies
[4:47:04] MrGattz: they do already have, they have been making the mmo for a couple years now
[4:47:11] tkbrummett: Only MMO other than WoW i have any interest in trying out
[4:47:18] Alaquane: can you imagine a summoner's rift battle ground?
[4:47:23] blightanker: designing the next big mmo will be on bunch for atleast 4-5 years which is kinda too big time specially current generation which favors ultra fast pace games dunno if they will suceed or be another cancel project
[4:47:32] rocthenite: ashes is just content creator smoke
[4:47:40] Alaquane: 3v3 twisted treeline battleground
[4:47:46] esrou: Riot also has the lore and background player base to make something big
[4:47:46] sinlesssinner: imagine genshin impact, but as an MMO.... WoW is dead bro @Towelliee
[4:47:52] rocthenite: it just asmon and lazy peon hyping it up
[4:47:59] ChibiElemental: @Towelliee But also remember riot rarely announces any game that isn't in some way already playable. so I wouldn't even be suprised if this mmo is farther along then they are letting on.
[4:48:15] BoezIRL: 10 years
[4:48:16] Sinsteel: 2009
[4:48:17] esrou: 2010
[4:48:20] Alaquane: they just released a book
[4:48:20] Scubaskot: the gaming culture is stuck, man @Towelliee its been the case for 20 years
[4:48:25] tkbrummett: they redact their lore every few years or so though :(
[4:48:27] Warjun11: i will play yordle
[4:48:33] Endymion32: think u have to look a lot of mmo's and extract whats the best of them to make a competition for wow, and i think thats why wow is immortal cause it already has some of the best elements
[4:48:36] angryhonkinggoose: #Deadgame

[4:48:40] Crazy212: Only problem with League lore is it gets changed and certain things are retconned every couple months
[4:48:51] Akoudadis: @Towelliee League has so much lore! and they are building it in the last 5-6 years
[4:48:56] Ascendor81: m0 gives you reward end of week? or do you have to do at least an m1?
[4:48:57] MrGattz: book em
[4:48:58] Luthercorpz: 10 years ago
[4:49:03] Alaquane: I mean all the warcraft 3 players knew
[4:49:03] Scubaskot: the gaming culture is stuck, man @Towelliee its been the case for 20 years
[4:49:21] sinlesssinner: its weeb generation, WoW will retain its subs, but it wont be the number one MMO anymore.
[4:49:22] Arangar: no, can get 0 drops
[4:49:35] Ezekyler: someone is lying monkaS
[4:49:40] PadidinJones: check your cal
[4:49:41] Siechtum: LUL
[4:49:43] Luthercorpz: Yah Cyberpunk was marketed as some game changing production an it was just a sub par shooter rpg with Reeves in it LUL
[4:49:45] Artivicii: LUL
[4:49:45] Luthercorpz: At best
[4:49:47] sinlesssinner: next mmo with anime style characters wins
[4:49:47] Wolfroguee: Yeah you can get zero loot
[4:49:51] rocthenite: dude i saw someone that said cyberpunk sucks becuase CDPR hired too many "dirveriaty hires"
[4:49:59] DelvarKaron: you dont always get loot from every boss
[4:50:14] mr_mistrix: Im saved, damn it
[4:50:15] XarkoLP: u can see it in the jornal to, if u done the bosses
[4:50:19] Endymion32: @Luthercorpz wasnt marketed like that a tall, thats just what people expected
[4:50:33] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I think you got Jebaited
[4:50:40] Luthercorpz: @SunLian ...lol CmonBro
[4:51:19] rocthenite: honestly CDPR did not deseave the respect it gained, they made ONE GOOD GAME

[4:51:50] rocthenite: and they spend 5 years making elon musk memes and stroking reddit's boner
[4:51:51] Luthercorpz: GTA is still far superior to Cyberpunk an every other story shooter RPG ever made
[4:51:56] Luthercorpz: An that game is old AF
[4:51:59] MrGattz: oh stop it
[4:52:19] ylcard: you were fucked, now it's better
[4:52:21] Xmandalorex1: yup
[4:52:21] whoisqnx: how it should be EZ
[4:52:22] Kaykerrs: playstation took it off their store
[4:52:27] crossfire_omg: PS5 AND NEW X BOX is fine
[4:52:27] Kaykerrs: and xbox is refunding
[4:52:29] Bodza96: bruh thats your opinion @rocthenite one good game lmao
[4:52:29] Ezekyler: even in PC is screwed
[4:52:31] rozurial1987: CYBERPUNK SHOULDNT HAVE CAME OUT ON LAST GEN CONSOLES
[4:52:34] Givin: Modders came through for PC
[4:52:37] itsNODDERS: @crossfire_omg no there not
[4:52:38] rozurial1987: sry caps didnt mean for that
[4:52:45] Ezekyler: it's palayable but has a lot of bugs and an awful AI
[4:52:51] Luthercorpz: Cyberpunk hardly runs on PS5 LUL
[4:52:51] MrGattz: cdpr is a great company. there was no way under the sun they were going to live up to the hype that the community made out of nothing.
[4:52:54] rozurial1987: should have just came out for new gen and pc
[4:53:00] Endymion32: @Luthercorpz if they work for almost 8 years on a game, and u get disappointed and u know they really put time and effort in it like they did on the witcher, maybe there's something wrong with your expectations
[4:53:03] KickyMcFace: Mine runs fine, and I'm not running anything too crazy. (also fun)
[4:53:05] Contendedlemon: maybe in a few years it'll get better like No Mans Sky KEKW
[4:53:07] Endymion32: thats how it looks to me with cyberpunk
[4:53:14] rocthenite: it was showed off at xbox e3 showcase
[4:53:24] Ezekyler: they hide the old gen consoles videos and screenshot to hide the game
[4:53:51] ChibiElemental: it is a good game if you have a computer to play it.
[4:53:57] Luthercorpz: @SunLian Cyberpunk clearly was a cutting edge game 7 years if they released it then working. You cn see ho it was a 7-5 yaer old game at best
[4:53:57] idabien: true
[4:53:57] Exoduc: I had a great time on pc, 100 hours in and only had visual bugs that were funnier than they were annoying
[4:54:01] idabien: buff guaridan druids please
[4:54:02] taschen_lampe: @Towelliee How do you like the new WOW addon? it it that much better?
[4:54:03] TimOTaaaaaY: it looks like a good game it just doesn't run very well for some people
[4:54:04] Artivicii: 13K kekw
[4:54:05] Broongoon: im playin on xbox and lovin it.. put aside a few crashes from time to time
[4:54:10] MrGattz: tbh people should be honored that they ported the game to old gen consoles.. theres no reason they should have even attempted to put a new gen game on an old gen console.
[4:54:19] Endymion32: @Luthercorpz yea no shit, thats how long they've been working on it so u knew that already
[4:54:27] ylcard: @Exoduc I know right? I love these bugs. Cars falling from the sky is the best xD
[4:54:35] Endymion32: i dont know what magic tricks people expect
[4:54:42] Mrstreet619: 30k
[4:54:45] Mrstreet619: Lol
[4:54:46] Kromede: dat voice NotATK
[4:54:47] TheUnknowing: it was originally going to be on the previous gen though @MrGattz
[4:54:55] ChibiElemental: if it was that bad though they really just should have canceled the old gen.
[4:54:55] Kromede: i meant NotLikeThis
[4:55:00] givmeafrekinname: @MrGattz PS4 WAS the new gen console when it was 1st released, was it not?
[4:55:09] Luthercorpz: @SunLian Yah aka they just dragged a dead old horse of a game that was never going to work to the stage. An the PC version works but its 6/10 game at best
[4:55:17] Lotarion_: Lotarion_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[4:55:17] Givin: It was first announced as in development in 2012

[4:55:25] NewWorldReign: Thanks for the 2020Glitchy @lotarion_
[4:55:45] ChibiElemental: also remember witcher 3 is not the same game it is now on launch either.
[4:55:49] Marcinek_xP: Flower
[4:55:51] MrGattz: @jmg1988 wait when what was first released?
[4:55:54] ZetherTV: 4 leaf
[4:55:55] storm99413: flower
[4:55:55] Artivicii: LUL
[4:55:56] Krait06: LUL
[4:56:01] ChibiElemental: CDPR is known for coming out with meh launch games then making them amazing later.
[4:56:03] TheUnknowing: the game was MEANT to come out on xbox one and ps4, it was just delayed so many times
[4:56:10] givmeafrekinname: @MrGattz When they 1st revealed Cyperpunk I mean
[4:56:16] Auru: yall need some mind games
[4:56:18] Auru: jesus
[4:56:21] mr_mistrix: Had havoc dh and vegen dh in my m key run, and vegen was top 2 dmg done overall lol. havoc last
[4:56:40] givmeafrekinname: @MrGattz wasn't it before PS4 and XBX1 was even out?
[4:56:40] Givin: haha I read that as Vegan DH
[4:56:42] storm99413: leaf
[4:56:49] Luthercorpz: I just remember seeing all the Cyberpunk ads none stop an everyone creaming their pants at how it was gonna be the next lvl rpg game changer for 2 years now LUL
[4:57:00] Luthercorpz: R.I.P
[4:57:07] Sekt_: Hey Towelliee hows it going?
[4:57:08] Endymion32: @Luthercorpz nah i dunno, u could say maybe they shouldn't work on a game for SO long because this is what happens but, its really mostly expectations of people
[4:57:18] Endymion32: everyone knew it was in development for years
[4:57:25] Givin: I used to play Cyberpunk tabletop.
[4:57:26] EpicJune: actual drops Pog
[4:57:30] yooj123: I mean it is pretty next level, just poorly optimized
[4:57:34] yooj123: Bugs too
[4:57:38] mr_mistrix: I mean, lets be honest Cyberpunk is good game, yes it has bugs, but it is just a bugs, which will get fixed, but it self game is awesome I think
[4:57:44] yooj123: ^
[4:57:47] Givin: That and Shadowrun.
[4:57:51] Alaquane: isn't that just shadowrun?
[4:58:04] kalamari__: wait for the 2 big patches they announced for january and february
[4:58:09] ylcard: wait for a month or two, after the actual patches come in, not the hotfixes
[4:58:13] Givin: Shadowrun is more fantasy meets sci fi
[4:58:16] ChibiElemental: Wait 6month and cyberpunk 2077 will be probably a completely different game @Towelliee Thats just how CDPR works.
[4:58:20] Givin: but the systems are very similar
[4:58:20] MrGattz: @jmg1988 right... yes but that game was never made to be on that console just because the new gen wasnt publicly announced. the devs like most other AAA studios have access to the specs of the new consoles well before others just so they can dev a game for them. not always the case for everyone but i could only assume with the amount of work they clearly put into utilizing the hardware of the new gen.
[4:58:20] TheUnknowing: I'll play cyberpunk in a few months when everything is ironed out, as it is I wasn't hyped for it any ways so
[4:58:28] Luthercorpz: @SunLian Working on it long isnt a bad thing but you cam tell this particular game always had issue and could never live up to the idea of what it wanted to be. The devolvement's foundational failure is naked now you see the game

[4:58:38] Endymion32: @Luthercorpz also dont forget, the game recommends an rtx 3k series for ultra settings, well how many people have that right now?
[4:58:41] Givin: Cyberpunk has orks, trolls, elves, dwarves and such
[4:58:59] ylcard: Witcher 3 was more or less the same, but they do take their time 'fixing' shit
[4:59:03] mr_mistrix: wonder how good graphic I can get with 1080 :(
[4:59:05] KickyMcFace: @SunLian I play ultra on most settings with a 2060
[4:59:20] Luthercorpz: @SunLian Yah idk man to me it's clear just looking at the game it function etc.. They've always had issues an they just dragged it all the way to the finish line
[4:59:25] Givin: er Shadowrun sorry
[4:59:27] Endymion32: @KickyMcFace cant be, u have no new raytracing

[6:07:25] hnti86: Silverhand
[6:07:33] h_u_r_k_: I'm enjoying that game /shrug
[6:07:46] KingSlayerYotam: @Towelliee when do you see blizz releasing 9.1? with so much stuff to do with the covenants, it seems like a long grind
[6:07:52] Sovekz: You can enjoy garbage, don't worry
[6:07:54] Aktieindex: cyberoverhyped
[6:07:57] X_Betelgeuse_X: Cyberpunk is a great game, but haters gonna hate
[6:08:05] Luthercorpz: Yah it goes to show why games like WoW have longevity. WoW raids running for weeks while the biggest "anticipated" game in over a decade fades out in 2 weeks.
[6:08:05] hnti86: imagine trying to run this game on 7 yo console LUL
[6:08:08] Exoduc: im enjoying cyberpunk still, 100 hours into it. already going through second playthrough

[6:08:12] Shrenko: 🤡
[6:08:34] hunterxp: towRee
[6:08:55] mr_mistrix: I wish Demon Hunters had 3rd spec as ranged dps (like hunter )
[6:08:59] angryhonkinggoose: played it until the end of act 1, then shelved it, will return to it in 6 months
[6:09:15] Shrenko: scummy move by CDPR
[6:09:29] X_Betelgeuse_X: PC Master Race bby
[6:09:31] KonaWolfeee: played the game. beat it. then playstation hooked me up with a refund. the game was boring as fuck
[6:09:32] Luthercorpz: The CEO 2 days before launch was giving interviews saying this game runs great on PS4 LUL
[6:09:33] jasperboy: Cyberpunk 2077 PC Exclusive!
[6:09:41] CDubTheRIPper: it needs some dcwMilk
[6:09:46] Luthercorpz: The game is shit on PS5 too.. so
[6:09:46] fistofnature: too much expectations and hype for it
[6:09:55] viran206: its an amazing game. and it has soo much potential.
[6:09:55] Akoudadis: @Towelliee we can preety much forget about Cyberpunk until 2022! when its ready to release
[6:09:55] EpicJune: people over hyped themselves imho
[6:10:03] Nebulizer87: let it simmer and get its two big DLCs then ill come play the complete version
[6:10:07] Exoduc: yes, cant speak for consoles, running it on a 3080 is an amazing experience worth the hype imo
[6:10:07] Lizurdz: "It runs surprisingly well" - the quote that will forever live in infamy
[6:10:12] Shrenko: I watched Cohh play it for like 15min yesterday and holy shit all the bugs and glitches he encountered during that short period
[6:10:16] MrGattz: imagine expecting a brand new AAA title to run great on an 8 year old console
[6:10:17] Sovekz: CDPR themselves hyped that game beyond belief
[6:10:29] Megadisaster24: I mean, the game was everything I was expecting from it, I'm 40hrs in and loving it, can't wait what the modding community can do with it
[6:10:33] Akoudadis: @viran2068 Exactly what we were saying for Anthem :'(
[6:10:35] viran206: that is the cost of progress. you cant expect it to run on 5 year old consoles.
[6:10:36] h_u_r_k_: only had 1 crash on my ps5, other than that, its been great!
[6:10:39] NerdyTeK: @MrGattz LULW i have been saying the same thing
[6:10:47] viran206: nobody said that for anthem llol
[6:10:48] Cabbageman007: Towel Claus this Year?
[6:10:52] Luthercorpz: You can tell playing the game just by it's missions, how it runs evn on good PC the game was rushed. The story is there but you can tell even that has a good 30% plus missing from it.
[6:10:54] Phishsticks420: oblivion didn't even run right on the Xbox 360
[6:11:04] LiveFromStua: 7 / 10 when the game was HYPED to oblivion. I would say that's a great outcome
[6:11:15] Screamnsteam: Cyberpunk can go Rest In Peace with fall guys and among us lmao
[6:11:16] EpicJune: Anthem was just bad LUL
[6:11:19] RexMophinos: 476,677 people currently playing cyberpunk on steam damn
[6:11:19] h_u_r_k_: The Witcher 3 was a horrible launch, it took them along time to make it a very good game.
[6:11:22] Sovekz: Imagine expecting the Developers not to lie about it running on an old console
[6:11:23] Alaquane: towDynt
[6:11:23] Luthercorpz: The ending cut scenes with Rogue are trash. The big boss fight with Smasher is over in a min...lacking
[6:11:26] Akoudadis: @Towelliee Hey! they wworking on ANTHEM still! 2.0 is coming xD
[6:11:28] MrGattz: blows my mind. we lost critical game dev time that could have been put into fixing bugs to a ps4 port
[6:11:36] angryhonkinggoose: i would say that 30% of the story, mechanics, gameplay was cut from the game
[6:11:42] Shrenko: CDPR knew they were gonna sell millions of copies for PS4 and Xbox one and they didnt show how shitty the versions were before hand
[6:11:49] shadowkeeps: shadowkeeps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[6:11:56] viran206: some bonehead in charge said to put it on older consoles to make more money. and thats why it feels rushed, even getting it to run on the old consoles is an incredible feat.
[6:12:00] Megadisaster24: @RexMophinos and that doesn't account for GoG and Epic Store
[6:12:05] bvbdragon: @stinkypanda_ i played through it like 70hrs on week one, had no issues lol
[6:12:14] Shrenko: RDR2 runs like smooth butter on PS4 and Xbox one though LUL
[6:12:17] RexMophinos: Megadisaster24 yeah i have it on gog

[6:14:36] Megadisaster24: Give it 5 years and everyone will be praising CDPR and Cyberpunk for being incredible RPG, Same happened to Skyrim, Oblivion and Witcher 2/3, everyone shat on them on release then they were praising them as greatest ever after some time
[6:14:41] fistofnature: @Towelliee are you night fae on your demonhunter?

[6:15:45] Shellstars: Did u loot that boss Towelliee
[6:15:47] myguyhood: @MrGattz tysm
[6:15:47] givmeafrekinname: @Megadisaster24 no one was expecting skyrim and oblivion to be perfect on release, with Bethesda's reputation, not sure how Witcher was being reported before release though
[6:15:47] FunkySkunkyTV: so ResidentSleeper
[6:15:51] MrGattz: np
[6:16:11] givmeafrekinname: @Megadisaster24 not even perfect, playable even
[6:16:16] Sh4nti: Like only 5% of dialogue choices matter in CP2077 and all the endings are just dependent on 1 dialogue choice

[6:17:21] angryhonkinggoose: nope, it doesnt matter much
[6:17:23] viran206: 3 endings and each 1 has several ways to reach it.
[6:17:30] Sh4nti: There is only 1 choice for all the endings
[6:17:32] Luthercorpz: It has 6 endings but yah most the story is all in one direction
[6:17:40] Luthercorpz: 6 endings
[6:17:40] kretok: 2% off all someone checked it
[6:17:44] Sh4nti: Lifepaths don't matter at all
[6:17:53] uxibixu: 4 endings and 1 secret ending
[6:18:05] Luthercorpz: yah life paths are pointless that entire thig was a marketing lie
[6:18:15] mo197: 3 different answers SabaPing
[6:18:15] angryhonkinggoose: what ending you get has more to do with doing more of the sidequests
[6:18:25] viran206: you cant get the johhny ending if you treat him like shit
[6:18:35] Demented7: Dialogue only goes 2 ways for quests
[6:18:43] angryhonkinggoose: if you rush the main quest- bad ending
[6:18:44] Luthercorpz: There is one ending where you just off urself before even doing the last mission. The endings are all on YouTube
[6:18:54] The_Katana_Spamer: morining everyone
[6:19:08] Alaquane: man, full spoiler mode here
[6:19:17] Luthercorpz: LUL

[6:19:21] viran206: dialog options also affect whether you have to fight some groups or not at all.
[6:19:25] Lizurdz: Life paths are mainly just for unique dialogue options here and there, and can give unique outcomes for certain quests
[6:19:26] Shrenko: nooo spoilers

[6:48:14] randazzle26: they are gonna take the lazy way out, just like they did with Classic and not have XYZ patches like original TBC which is what we want
[6:48:27] akia03: we still have 7-8 weeks of renown left to do
[6:48:32] alph4r1us: Do you think TBC will continue from the same Classic servers / characters? Or fresh start and not a part from Classic?
[6:48:35] iitsmadness: do you think we'll see a wotlk remaster?
[6:48:54] drunken_panda86: @towelliee please help me out. im debating if I should return to wow and this xpack. i have played wow before up until legion but not sure if a new player like me has chances to gear up and be taken in dungeons/raids....
[6:49:25] predtr_: @alph4r1us how can you fresh start TBC? from lvl 1?
[6:50:02] CallThatReal: Do you think a TBC classic would carry characters over from current classic or would they make us start over
[6:50:24] Veegore: I can't wait to roll a DH in tBC classic
[6:50:29] alph4r1us: @predtr_ yes, hard reset to preserve anything on classic
[6:50:47] randazzle26: Private server tuning is to the point of almost being mathematically impossible. That's how they've tuned those servers.
[6:50:52] belfastcl: attunements are great
[6:50:53] alph4r1us: or is classic over and continues via TBC
[6:51:04] svenskavelli: was their more tank diversity in TBC?
[6:51:23] belfastcl: i still remember wiping in black morass trying to get the kara one
[6:51:25] og_gt710: tbc is better than classic in general its a true expansion
[6:51:35] Veegore: @svenskeren07 yes. tBC was the first real sightings of bear tanks. also shaman tanks for certain fights
[6:51:59] pukerud: The days you acutally had to chose one maybe two characters :P
[6:52:05] randazzle26: we use a bear tank every week in Classic atm
[6:52:05] Luthercorpz: Classic was great but BC was the Mecca of WoW
[6:52:07] Telmorra: wtb rogue tanks

[6:52:45] MOLAR305: we had 9 druid healers in our guild during vanilla for every tier.. poor restos
[6:52:59] viran206: drunken panda, play a tank or healer and u will get plenty of groups. dps not so much
[6:53:00] GeeThePally: BELF racial was way OP in the beginning of TBC
[6:53:11] Zanlak: how do you think bm monk is looking for mythic+?
[6:53:17] RexMophinos: drunken_panda86 best way to get gear by far is actually to get honor currency from pvp and buy gear from pvp vendor

[7:09:33] Crazdmadman: yeah
[7:09:33] FunkySkunkyTV: god yes!
[7:09:36] Alaquane: Ian just dodged
[7:09:36] ListeningClose: it should b but isnt nearly as big of a deal as essences or anything, just costs me a couple hours per character
[7:09:36] kakadu31: nope
[7:09:40] mrelgaato: essences should be account wide too @Towelliee
[7:09:41] Zerksyera: No
[7:09:42] rainerwulf: cuz your alt may not be ilvl for it
[7:09:46] kalamari__: yeah, maybe later with 9.2
[7:09:46] PadidinJones: Im sure there might be a way to easy pass through the layers as a catchup later on
[7:09:58] BfAleTitan: he didn't dodge it
[7:10:03] SorionTheGinger: @rainerwulf then do something lower if you cant manage it?
[7:10:06] BfAleTitan: he said no plans currently but maybe in the future
[7:10:09] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[7:10:15] pooranoia: for me it was okay doing all 8 floors again didnt mind it to much
[7:10:20] rainerwulf: uhmm true
[7:10:25] Veegore: at least venari powers for torghast are shared so nice having that 5 cost power on each vendor on everyone
[7:10:28] Jenoseph: so i heard flying is coming to shadowlands do u know when it will happen?
[7:10:39] esrou: I mean the way Rogue likes work is different classes you need to push through the lower levels
[7:10:42] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what is your current ilvl?
[7:10:42] Ertra: you missed a clickable thing back there
[7:10:48] rainerwulf: maybe the buffs but still can it be possibel with alts?
[7:11:15] pooranoia: what they did with the alts and leveling was so fun doing torgasht 8 times again wasnt to bad
[7:12:36] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP Morning

[7:13:39] zorthan76: the fact you have to do 8 isnt bad its just gearing for it on some classes can take a min
[7:14:08] randazzle26: out of all your tanks which do you prefer to play other than your paladin @Towelliee ?
[7:14:51] Minoumi: unending thorgast would be cool
[7:14:56] Affiiance: I enjoy it much more now, it was just a slog. It wasnt a fun difficulty
[7:15:08] FattBeard: Why don't they just make two difficulties. Like give it a mythic version for those who want more of a challenge.
[7:15:12] EpicJune: was defo unblanced for some classes
[7:15:16] Aquadriel: @Towelliee think people dontunderstand problem with thorgast was not difficulty itself but time, it is not fun when a run takes you 30+ minutes only to fail on last boss.
[7:15:37] Veegore: up'ing health pools isn't more difficult its just bland and time sludge

[7:15:42] rainerwulf: to me Torghast feel like something out of Diablo imo hehe
[7:15:46] zeeAbe: Endless Torghast is coming though, but it will only reward transmog and maw mount etc
[7:15:55] pooranoia: I wish it wasnt nerfd maybe give it some more time before they nerf they keep nerf things its kinda lame

[7:16:07] tauntpleas: ilvl
[7:16:08] mix_taped: gear or some kind of gear currency from torghast would be cool
[7:16:31] Bonedit: i saw someone with maw mount in Oribos
[7:16:32] Veegore: #3
[7:16:43] rainerwulf: mix the gear is made over time to make Leds bro
[7:16:57] pooranoia: is it me or they just nerfing so much, is this normal. i like it more difficult...

[7:17:59] akia03: if they put lego mats behind it it cant be hard
[7:18:00] jerseyfive: it's easy for tanks and only tanks
[7:18:06] zeeAbe: First 3 or so floors of Layer 8 have some difficulty in them, after that you just get so much power it becomes a bonkfest
[7:18:15] zeeAbe: My healer was doing 15k DPS
[7:18:16] Aquadriel: dont think it was difficult, but it was tedius specially if you got shit powers
[7:18:31] swizzlehands: its not that torghast was difficult it was the fact they just buffed health numbers to make it feel like a slog imo
[7:18:36] Gideonhawke: meh i will be soul ash capped before i have the gold to use it\
[7:18:59] esrou: Honestly Blizz should go the Hades route with Torghast. Run into NPCs that give unique powers but we cannot rescue them yet
[7:19:04] Exoduc: @jerseyfive not my experience anymore after last patch, my guardian druid cant deal enough damage at l8 as the mobs have too much health, i completed it as feral tho
[7:19:07] BigDP: God morning @Towelliee , are blood dk good fun for running Thorgast?
[7:19:11] rainerwulf: it's kinda hard just needs some planning to attack on layer 8 solo.. a party haven't tried it.. in party with 2 pallies i did a layer 7
[7:19:21] Dreamzyi: how much can an alt make this week for soul ash?
[7:19:35] tauntpleas: before nerf as enhance I couldn't clear lvl 4 last floor now I can clear 8 insanely buffed
[7:19:39] rainerwulf: Pallies' rock
[7:19:48] tauntpleas: but nice bc I need soul ash
[7:20:01] Veegore: BDK gets really boring powers mostly

[7:23:26] DrRockso85: Torghast is a lot of fun. I hit a SLAM on a boss for 90k lol
[7:23:43] esrou: The thing about Rogue likes, is their best content is when abilities are constantly changing
[7:23:50] deadly22: how far in m raid did you get?
[7:24:26] BfAleTitan: just cleared a layer 8 on outlaw rogue, had so many stat powers it kinda felt like a 3 lol

[8:09:30] Affiiance: Depends on build and what content you are doing
[8:09:44] zmozony: wahts a good prot pala legendary for pvp?
[8:09:47] letrickyxd: You don't spec out of soul bomb, unless you do the Brand build
[8:09:47] MikeDTv: @Towelliee Right im a dh main
[8:10:11] Veegore: Sigil one is bis for raid and m+ if you're kyrian
[8:10:17] letrickyxd: Sigil = more damage, Brand = tankiness and good damage
[8:10:20] Affiiance: You go with that leggo no matter what pretty much, but the builds can change
[8:10:21] Veegore: unless you swap build completely to firey brand
[8:10:27] MikeDTv: @Towelliee Fel bomb is what I thought people needed to get for veg dh
[8:10:37] letrickyxd: @Affiiance no you don't
[8:10:44] letrickyxd: you go brand gloves if you go brand buiild lmao

[8:11:30] Bissenz: Just joined the stream, what quest is gated?
[8:11:43] letrickyxd: @Towelliee the leggo is called FIery Soul iirc, the one where you soul cleave and reduces brand CD
[8:11:50] datcreepa: probably not until 9.1 patch
[8:11:52] letrickyxd: if you do that one
[8:12:01] JeffsStolenBike: Gigatron_7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months!

[8:12:38] Veegore: you'll get more bang for your buck with raz as kyrian
[8:12:44] CADZtv: isnt fiery soul more for raiding and raze for mythic

[8:12:58] CardinalTX: raz licks who?
[8:13:03] Trailerhitch: towBlue

[8:32:48] valianya: What if anima powers gave an option to forego the power and choose soul ash instead as a catch-up mechanic or way to make torghast harder for slightly higher reward? @towelliee
[8:32:51] TheRiwen: no
[8:32:51] CardinalTX: @fluh_ 100 fuckin % agree
[8:33:01] Larc9783: Shit was impossible as a rogue for the first 2 weeks beyond floor 2 to solo
[8:33:04] Aquadriel: it was no t a difficulty issue, was a time issue
[8:33:06] GermanBacon: make the ones for Soul Ash easy as fuck, but when it comes out, make the endless one for mounts hard as hell
[8:33:06] jure__: im enjoying the lower difficulty, but it also couldve been solved with more powerful powers
[8:33:09] shalros: i agree, i didnt mind the difficulty, but i hated the 1+hours it took to do the high layers
[8:33:14] SorionTheGinger: @Aquadriel this

[8:33:30] TheRiwen: just make a heroic version for you try hard people
[8:33:32] BlackRhyno74: you can reset the floor before you begin phishing for a better layout
[8:33:37] Mr_Schnoz: Torghast needs more incentives to run it, when people have their legendaries it will be dead content. It should either contribute to your Great Vault or provide one piece of high ilvl gear per week.
[8:33:39] sumdude1974: For pallys and warrs its sleepwalking lo;l
[8:33:40] CardinalTX: i like it diablo style....just run through wrecking shit and gtfo
[8:33:44] PaydayPaylor: I would have kept the difficulty but just doubled the anima powers, that way i could become a monster a do big dps to big things
[8:33:45] warrenny: @longsnapper99 Rets decent too in torghast
[8:33:52] EpicJune: I wold have added more crazy anima powers
[8:33:55] BlackRhyno74: even with a short floor.. sometimes you can get unlocky with a few elites right at the start before your rolling powerups
[8:34:02] LongSnapper99: @warrenny is it? Haven’t ran through it as ret yet.
[8:34:24] krazybum: wish i could run through this quickly with my shdow priest lol
