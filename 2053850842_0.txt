[3:57:46] Marlye213: @Dj_Oo__ if you have buff up you, it wont drop
[3:57:56] hauserdot: I feel like rogue @lobsteronvalorant is nice for newbies especially if you wanna be on pvp server so you can avoid conflicts mostly but be ready for the stigma that can come with it. but it’s pretty easy to pick up I think it’s a little easier then mage or hunter being a melee class. and with the energy resource system it’s forgiving in pve and very strong in both pve and pvp but the ranged options are good choices as well
[3:58:13] Boska04: will you be able to reset trash in bfd?
