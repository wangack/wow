[0:21:18] vulkankragon: anyone else feels like dragonflight is the last expansion and after that blizzard will focus on diablo 4 as their main mmo and keep wow in maintenance mode
[0:21:38] Thoreya: no
[0:22:58] falldrgn: WoW is still going strong.
[0:23:47] Thoreya: 1) diablo isnt an mmo 2) relying on such a decision when the game is not even out yet seems very unwise 3) wow makes blizz the most $ currently
[0:23:54] Thoreya: just a couple reasons off the top of my head
[0:24:43] vulkankragon: yes but feels like the end is near. dunno but its a strong feel and i never felt like that before.
[0:25:34] falldrgn: How is the End Near? We still have  lots of stories to tell. they just put a new class in. additionally the newest xpac is less than a year old.
[0:25:35] JoK3Ro7: WoW has a long while before it ends...
[0:26:00] JoK3Ro7: At some point though they have to start thinking about a new engine
[0:26:16] falldrgn: Will we make it 20 more expansion's. no.. My guess 3-5
[0:26:46] Thoreya: they prob have ppl working on the first raid for 11.0 rn

[1:08:08] rohdey: ever*
[1:08:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: The utility of racials is often the biggest factor

[1:16:55] ZeusDNA: @pereadin Morning!
[1:17:08] spatchttv: @towelliee as a late 20 year old that had never played classic wow more than the free trial back in the day. Hc imo is the best mode to get into the game. Set a goal to get to level 10 and die and reroll all classes. I’ve had a ball and hope they make it an official server
[1:17:12] pereadin: Ended up upgrading my 970 to a AMD 6650XT (slightly better than a 3060). Very happy with my purchase :D
[1:17:19] neverbornlucky: Towelliee if blizzard was to make any of their IP a vr game don't you think Diablo would be the best break into vr for Blizzard
[1:17:37] pereadin: @ZeusDNA towHi

[1:18:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: An official hardcore server would be a draw....and yeah it can't be as hardcore as the addon
[1:18:51] Samurai3434: How high a level did you get to in Hardcore?
[1:18:51] spatchttv: Well look at hc RuneScape.
[1:18:53] Shrenko: more classic drama FeelsGoodMan

[1:19:19] dimofodi: Well there won't be appeals for one thing if they did it. You die due to griefer...you're dead. Stick to the challenge. Lol
[1:19:20] Nicoz971: Blizzard wont dedicate people to do the appeals so yeah it will be worse

[1:22:43] Shrenko: @Towelliee Imo they should copy pasta hardcore from Turtle wow. No AH or mailbox, BUT you can trade and group up with people 5+- lvl of you. Death announces in chat, where and how they died, you automatically get put into the HC guild and its called '' Still Alive '' and at lvl 60 all HC restrictions get lifted, you get a mount and the title '' Immortal ''
[1:22:57] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[1:23:01] ArcaneSyntax: The classic community kinda sucks so them being unhappy is kinda good.

[1:58:39] raldrik: They also took away the trade to one guy and have him log off work around for loot trading. That should mean extra splits.

[2:06:16] tszord: Id like to see seasonal affix come from the raid for that season
[2:06:18] neftario105: @towelliee u making a guild on Diablo 4?
[2:06:44] ArcaneSyntax: You know, they said if the system works they're keeping it, but probably changing the names. So we might get names like badge of justice, valor, heroism back.

[3:51:13] xziyn: You said the same after WoD though lol
[3:51:16] Einzbern: I thought they seperated classic wow and retail wow into different categories on twitch. Did they merge them back at some point?
[3:51:17] todiie: i can only imagine how good next expansion is going to be if they keep this up
[3:51:19] 71brewz: until SL, I never knew you really played anything else @Towelliee lol

[3:52:17] Xara36: lol
[3:52:18] Meakis: shadowlands had lots of bad gameplay decisions, dreanor had good gameplay but a lot of cut content and just not enough
[3:52:29] Mostdangspy: I mean not now but what about like 5 or 10 years ago?
[3:52:40] TexValhalla: Towelliee you ever see yourself casting a RWF in your future?

[3:55:39] Bloodhaven08: wait a few till the event starts take some a kid into M+ for 2 runs

[3:55:47] PvtHudson093: get your high keys done
[3:56:28] ijuki: Ah I remember that one

[3:58:42] kappaday23: Sir I would like that Groupon
[3:58:48] Mister_Ript: Bonus Objectives, probably
[3:58:51] Kelticlore: just cause an expansion lacked content doesnt make it bad persay
[3:58:52] ZeusDNA: Bonus objectives I think
[3:58:55] Zolshy89: they mean bonus objectives
[3:58:57] TexValhalla: you meanbonus objectives?
[3:58:57] ijuki: Bonus areas in the zone for exp

[3:59:31] Red_Dead_Redeem: I remember playing in WOD and just seeing SW empty bc no one was playing that crap expansion
[3:59:35] kostchie: Blizzard should have kept the Wrath model of questing.
[3:59:36] inj0shwetrust: Like SL it lacked a whole ass patch
[3:59:39] PigPenLen: that would make it less expanding! lol
[3:59:52] xziyn: At least Draenor still has one of the best raids of all time. SL hasn't much besides Denathrius
[4:00:03] Meakis: If I'm giving money to it, I expect at least some level of content and for Dreanor they absolutly underdelivered
[4:00:04] Nosdunk24: @Red_Dead_Redeem SW was empty because everyone was in their garrison lol
[4:00:06] Bestbud: you didn't see anyone cause they stood in their garrisons @Red_Dead_Redeem
[4:00:07] DunzoCD: the token stonks in WoD were real
[4:00:11] kreloril777: shadowlands lol
[4:00:22] raldrik: I think the content drought for 10.1 is going to come quick. I think the lack of a grind is going to be felt even more and quicker in 10.1 than it did in 10.0. One can only run so much M+ before you go mad.
[4:00:25] gregl__: yet if I had to choose to play wod or legion tomm I would pick wod so I dont have to grind 14 hours a day to raid in my guild
[4:00:27] Chibs243: Where does DF sit on the good/bad scale?

[4:00:50] Red_Dead_Redeem: Cata still the worst expansion IMO
[4:01:08] kostchie: I spent more time doing the garrison stuff than playing the game outside of it. By the first patch i was done.
[4:01:09] Red_Dead_Redeem: Cata then WOD
[4:01:10] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[4:01:15] Nosdunk24: Shadowlands had great zones, and one of the best raids EVER in Castle Nathria
[4:01:51] Xan2008: true
[4:02:01] Kamst3rTTV: I haven't played every day of every expac, but I've loved every expac

[4:02:09] inj0shwetrust: S3 and 4 were good
[4:02:09] Incredible_Sausage: it was almost the only thing popping on twitch 24/7
[4:02:12] Kamst3rTTV: I'm casual af
[4:02:14] emznev: Bfà better
[4:02:15] Wcvechten: And it had the best villain ever made Kappa
[4:02:17] DunzoCD: I hated that all the shadowlands zones were all so separate, the world felt weird
[4:02:18] TheCliffyShow: OH, season 4. Thouight you meant the jailer cutscene for am int.e
[4:02:18] duffluv22: Meaningful Choice ruined the expansion.
[4:02:18] Red_Dead_Redeem: SL was weird, I hated having to do the whole quests with EVERY single alt
[4:02:19] jhajden: You mean they beat BFA Corruption??
[4:02:20] Nevindaz: I liked 9.0 tbh.. nathria was the best raid for me till Legion
[4:02:34] Jarlan23: my biggest problem was that every patch felt the same
[4:02:39] Nevindaz: the shadowlands start was amazing
[4:02:40] TexValhalla: the amount of grinding in SL hit me hard
[4:02:40] Exodeo_: I think Shadowlands had the downside that people had way too much time to play due to covid
[4:02:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lalafel chairs LUL
[4:02:49] Nosdunk24: When will Big Daddy D come back?
[4:02:54] jerseyfive: denatrius! he should have been the main villain
[4:02:54] Hitokiri83: WoD had so much cut content astleast 1 raid tier shatrath city and a whole zone in faralon
[4:02:56] kostchie: If not for the story mode questing experience and the continuing to borrow power. Shadowlands would have been a very good expansion.
[4:03:08] dynomite826: So what exactly can we do this week when the new patch drops? The mythic + come out this week or is that next week
[4:03:11] Nosdunk24: agreed
[4:03:12] Jarlan23: holy shit that drama as funny af the lalafel chair
[4:03:12] Wcvechten: WoD was literally wasted potential everywhere, so many promises neve rmade true
[4:03:24] Snabido: That was such a weird thing to learn about lol
[4:03:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: DF feels fresh and the patches actually feel meaningful, I am loving this new x-pac

[4:04:46] thetoysmith: VikingWarband subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! What is the best way to contact Towelliee with business opportunities?
[4:04:53] Nevindaz: Draenor was cool only from lore perspective

[4:05:08] Galadeon: The DF renown system is great.
[4:05:09] Red_Dead_Redeem: apparently what happend to WOD is what happened to SL that the release was hurried and they could not pump out the content to keep up
[4:05:09] kreloril777: I quit Wod/Wow and lost 110lbs, thanks blizzard lol

[4:07:50] Hebrewish012: yeah I'm okay with not grinding and doing the same thing over and over on 10 copies of same class
[4:07:52] temp3st98: and people complain right now because they say that there is nothing to do OMEGALUL
[4:07:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: I have no shame saying I am a casual
[4:07:57] gregl__: yes
[4:07:58] gregl__: correct
[4:08:01] gregl__: thd is the exception
[4:08:02] TaNGoIX: I LOVED Legion, but if it came out today, I'd prob just unsub because I have very little time outside my job and kid to grind that much.
[4:08:06] stonyman187: I  came back to playing wow after quitting in BC
[4:08:12] gregl__: there really isn't
[4:08:25] TheGiant99: You gonna grind D4 and WoW
[4:08:31] Hebrewish012: I would grind all day on maybe 1-3 chars
[4:08:37] Red_Dead_Redeem: but I was a casual grinding BFA stuff and I did the whole SL things too so I am not opposed to grinding...just prefer not too
[4:08:43] Hebrewish012: not 10
[4:08:48] Karn1987: what bout me the guy with 120 max lvls @Towelliee
[4:09:05] kostchie: Questing has been better. Not having to do a bunch of borrowed power nonsense is the best of this expansion experience.
[4:09:11] Kyle2k06: i love grinding games and did m+ for a while but over time i found ARPG more my style with not having to deal with other people and can grind away
[4:09:12] gassygatinho: With the new 2x per week world quests they could put back some form of borrowed power
[4:09:23] Yulya_Oh: i still prefer Legion ,but i played hardcore in it, now no time for this

[4:33:57] Lycis: Yea its all scripted nowadays but thats also more entertainment for the RWF

[4:35:18] joe_g_433: @hypertitan partially. We would be crazy not too think that blizzard used to do tuning during heroic week.
[4:35:21] darkrowse21: think there should be a mandatory 1/2 for RWF were all teams take a day off rest and recover i know max and liquid were running on fumes
