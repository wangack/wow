[0:09:00] Marmoh: This is what I was led to believe Floridians look like going about their day
[0:09:06] KushDaddy03: ChompinTony
[0:09:18] KingfisherGames: Tony Tony Chomper?
[0:09:19] IndigoCat: Poor Hazel. Sending feel better soon vibes.
[0:09:24] mirandaplaysgamesss: hazel I made a jalapeño cheese bread this morning and it’s so good
[0:09:27] supatease: pig tail sweater combo is slaying
[0:09:34] kynlaeh: landsharkmoose
[0:09:50] jeffdmk: agreed it is a super cute combo
[0:10:03] nyrhalahotep: Hazel looks especially happy today. 🥹🥹🥹
[0:10:05] apheelia96: I like Warming Theraflu
[0:10:07] Marmoh: You need to complete the set with a mint vape
[0:10:15] GreenArrowed: :(
[0:10:18] averageteacup: Why not a normal name? Justin? Steve .. Steve the Croc!
[0:10:25] cashthb: sup Sickzel?
[0:10:30] KingfisherGames: Irwin
[0:10:31] Jarettol: honey lemon ginger tea does wonders
[0:10:37] IAmScarlett__: croc
[0:10:40] IAmScarlett__: just call him croc
[0:10:41] wolfcloudchaser80: Well then Matilda.
[0:10:44] averageteacup: Lola is good
[0:10:55] Zuldak: woo Barry Manalow
[0:10:56] Marmoh: omg they do have six legs!
[0:11:04] mererndl: love that cardigan! looks very cozy
[0:11:08] cashthb: *sup Rapperzel?
[0:11:47] KingfisherGames: that's hilarious
[0:11:48] averageteacup: Isn't she lovely?
[0:11:53] Zinfiri: i have played WOW for over a decade and I never noticed they had 6 legs
[0:11:56] saga_no: The easiest way to tell the difference between alligators and crocodiles is the width of their head / snout ;P
[0:12:08] saga_no: Alligators are *wide* - crocs are narrow
[0:12:15] cashthb: lost all my points the day before
[0:12:19] ahnn112: i love that wow animals are either just a regular animal or a regular animal with extra legs
[0:12:22] nyrhalahotep: 😂😂😂
[0:12:26] GreenArrowed: rude
[0:12:40] Zuldak: the thing is you are not as familiar with horde leveling zones as alliance... hmm...
[0:12:47] GreenArrowed: i love that wow ducks don't really look like ducks but they're close enough
[0:13:20] KingfisherGames: @HazelNuttyGames crock nose is triangle, alligator nose is trapezoid
[0:13:30] Zuldak: do fish vendor well?
[0:13:31] apheelia96: I cant afford a fishing rod!
[0:13:34] saga_no: @HazelNuttyGames If the front of the snout is nearly as wide as the back of the head - it's likely an alligator - if the snout is tapered down and narrow in front compared to the back of the head - it's likely a crocodile
[0:13:43] Zuldak: does str work on hunter?
[0:14:28] Hippwn: Lola and her cute little waddle down the road
[0:14:41] Caistra: Hey Hazel. Love the sweater. It looks so cozy
[0:14:46] GreenArrowed: i don't think i ever noticed they had 6 legs
[0:14:49] Marmoh: Kinda has a hippo face
[0:15:02] Ujai321: it's a crocolisk
[0:15:03] apheelia96: narrow is crock right?
[0:15:09] marvin1995xo: is it on a fresh server ?
[0:15:14] GreenArrowed: yah
[0:15:18] Hippwn: trolls do have a toenail on their heels
[0:15:48] honeybun_games: hiya Hazel! hiya chat! love the cozy feels today! how's hardcore going?
[0:15:53] Zuldak: a dewclaw?:
[0:16:18] Zuldak: clappy clams... hmm
[0:16:27] KushDaddy03: Wow
[0:16:40] saga_no: So... I attempted Shuffle last night; as Disco. And it was *terrible* ...
[0:16:48] Ujai321: oh, you can just click the buff off?
[0:16:56] saga_no: So I might just eat the longer queues and try it as Shadow instead
[0:16:57] Ujai321: i thought those were new servers
[0:17:05] Marmoh: Tailoring would be fun in self foind
[0:17:17] Zuldak: so what profession makes arrows?
[0:17:26] saga_no: Also discovered that Shuffle rank is*per spec* (rude..) so I'd have to commit fully to ONE spec to have progress
[0:17:50] Ujai321: that is just clicking off the buff with extra steps
[0:17:55] elgoblina: which server are you on?
[0:18:09] Zuldak: engineering makes bullets i know but didnt know if they also made arrows
[0:18:27] saga_no: Yeah - I much prefer shadow -but I was willing to give disco a shot if that meant faster queues ...but like........ I'm SO BAD at it, have no idea what I'm doing, and I'm still awful as Shadow but at least I know a bit more about my toolkit
[0:18:41] Zuldak: just looked it up engineering does craft thorium arrows
[0:18:54] elgoblina: i made a druid for ssf, stuck between choosing lw/skinning and herb/alch
[0:19:09] saga_no: Is there an addon or setting that blocks /say popping up as speech bubbles on screen?
[0:19:35] KingfisherGames: Bugtopia got a webcomic update!
[0:19:44] McScooterson: heck yeah crocolisk heirarchy
[0:19:51] cashthb: why does the shaman class has the paladin colors on deathlog? I'm upset!
[0:20:06] McScooterson: @saga_no there's a setting in retail
[0:20:09] saga_no: OK cool - thanks - luckily I left the match before the others finished their yelling
[0:20:21] saga_no: So I don't know what htey had to say about me
[0:20:37] Ujai321: @Zuldak do they? all i can find is a quest to trade bullets for arrows
[0:21:07] KingfisherGames: If you've seen the webcomic Monsters and Girls? The one with the Angel and Demon girlfriends? That artist/writer does a separate comic on webtoon and its called Bugtopia. Super gay, a bunch of anthropomorphized bugs living and working in a city
[0:21:12] Ujai321: heck yeah deadzone!
[0:21:27] Jarettol: what does self found mean?
[0:21:30] cashthb: @saga_no probably nothing, most people don't really mind, especially in the beginer brackets; also if you lose every round everyone else wins
[0:21:50] Jarettol: oh wow...that's wild...love it
[0:21:59] saga_no: @cashthb I was the only priest in the whole match, and when someone starts with "that priest..." ... it's not anything good.
[0:22:05] Darabelia: good morning Hazel and chat
[0:22:29] KingfisherGames: @HazelNuttyGames I started doing Mechagon content, and I'm so glad I looted the blue punchcard that ups the drop rate of spare parts early
[0:22:42] Zuldak: honestly i think it was how the vanilla experience was because new players wanted to save gold and didnt know the AH had things to help them
[0:23:04] zarillon1: its relaxing
[0:23:10] Marmoh: What an incredible patch Mechagon was
[0:23:14] McScooterson: @Zuldak I sure didn't for the longest time
[0:23:16] Zuldak: heh lone ranger... hi ho silver! away!
[0:23:19] KingfisherGames: I already got my laser pointer, now i'm working on the last quest of the spidercrawler chain
[0:23:32] Ujai321: you *can* jump down here
[0:23:36] Ujai321: if you want
[0:23:45] jeffdmk: hazel if you had better skills would you get a cabin in the woods and not participate in society?
[0:23:57] zarillon1: i just realized zehla is hazel rearranged
[0:23:58] KingfisherGames: i'm also, after like, a week, only 3 pieces shy of completing the 7th Legionnaire's Leathers
[0:24:11] saga_no: Survival / Homestead skills
[0:24:11] witchhobbit: I’ve been done with the mechagon grind for a while now, but the blue spraybot blueprint won’t drop, the only thing i need
[0:24:13] Zuldak: @McScooterson yeah i think SSF is the more authentic vanilla experience. Now adays you get gold and get exactly what you need
[0:24:22] cashthb: I think jeff meant better kiting skills
[0:24:29] Zuldak: you have seen a lot of survival shows iirc
[0:24:46] saga_no: But have you lived for an extended period of time without running water or electricity?
[0:24:52] McScooterson: @Zuldak I was the saddest lil pally trying to blacksmith my way out of whites
[0:25:00] zarillon1: is this skull rock
[0:25:16] Jonboy4556: hello Hazel how are you today?
[0:25:38] averageteacup: I love being alone but i need to see people, just not in my room :D
[0:25:43] Ujai321: reminds me of the movie The Witch
[0:25:48] Zuldak: so i have never told anyone this. I read that agility would increase dodge. So as a mage who kept getting slapped, i thought hey i can use this cloth agility gear so i dont take damage.
[0:25:56] cashthb: prolly not true, people who can affor it move to bunkers in private islands and not into cabins
[0:26:04] Marmoh: Be financially comfortable to survive the locust plague
[0:26:13] wolfcloudchaser80: That's when I realized I was fairly different from other people. The prospect of never interacting with people *ever* doesn't bother me. And hey, that's not normal!
[0:26:16] Ujai321: @Zuldak it was a different time
[0:26:18] Zuldak: so yeah, i was the only agility stacking mage ever in wow
[0:26:31] Zuldak: also i stacked +fire damage gear.
[0:26:34] Zuldak: i had like NO mana
[0:26:38] TotallyNotRaien: can you grow a single potato in a pot?
[0:26:42] KingfisherGames: Hazel, it'd be neat if you got one of the companion pet snakes from orgrimmar to hang out with you for the run
[0:26:45] witchhobbit: yeah it is very nice to have your basic human needs met
[0:26:46] Jonboy4556: oh you have that garden pixie personality I can see that
[0:26:50] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 ...you and me both, dude. Though I don't count interacting online via things like Discord in this
[0:27:11] Jarettol: that's definitely on blizz not you, lol
[0:27:27] GreenArrowed: yaaaah in a bag or one of those big rubbermaid storage bins
[0:27:37] KingfisherGames: I kinda wanna start fruiting mushrooms, but I'm worried about the smell
[0:27:40] Ujai321: oh you got bags, nice
[0:27:50] IndigoCat: My daughter has grown potatoes in bags the last two summes
[0:27:54] KingfisherGames: it shouldn't be too bad if I do the woodchips bag strategy, but I'm interested
[0:27:57] Ujai321: classic
[0:28:00] IndigoCat: *summers
[0:28:12] Ujai321: do you stiill have DropTheCheapestThing?
[0:28:18] Jonboy4556: don't forgete to feed your crock
[0:28:35] cheesy_tater: hi Hazel cool scarf
[0:28:51] Ujai321: but does it feed your pet twice as well if you cook it
[0:28:51] dgriesemer: Can you use them in your bank?
[0:28:53] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no I do tend to be better with text based communicating, yeah. And I don't strongly dislike interacting, it's just.... tiring. I can only take so much before I crave solitude.
[0:28:59] cheesy_tater: LUL nice
[0:29:11] KingfisherGames: Binging with Babish: "Today we're going to make a grilled cheese sandwich. So the first step is to plant some wheat in a field and tend to it every day for 6 months. At the same time you need to milk a cow and being the process of fermenting the milk into cheese"
[0:29:14] TotallyNotRaien: would you like HC more if it had actual survival elements? like tiredness hunger etc or does it have that?
[0:29:16] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I have good news / bad news for you in that regard if you're interested LUL
[0:29:51] cashthb: isn't lama wool very-very expensive?
[0:29:59] Ujai321: i dislike survival elements in games. it is just busywork
[0:30:11] Jonboy4556: is this also SOD or are you on HC server?
[0:30:18] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Oh?
[0:30:18] jeffdmk: are you surprised by how few people are doing this?
[0:30:30] KingfisherGames: @Ujai321 I like survival elements in games built around them. I dislike them tacked onto games that don't need them.
[0:30:32] saga_no: Llamas are easily kept as livestock and produce a LOT of wool in a season, so it's not as expensive as you might think - though more expensive than say sheep's wool
[0:30:41] TotallyNotRaien: i always pegged you for a tree hugger
[0:30:47] Ujai321: i do like crafting, and i tolerate survival if that is what it takes, but if i have the option, i would rather just craft stuff and not food
[0:30:47] averageteacup: the sports of champions
[0:30:48] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I can DM you on Discord?
[0:30:51] KingfisherGames: A great example of this for me is "Stop putting weapon durability in all your RPGs"
[0:30:51] Jarettol: the forrest and son of the forrest make for some good tree punching mixed with horror
[0:30:55] wolfcloudchaser80: *raises hand* Fellow tree-puncher. Currently loving Nightingale.
[0:31:05] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Sure thing
[0:31:21] cashthb: 80 percent of games that came out in the last 5 years are either tree punchers or assassins creeds
[0:31:41] apheelia96: idk I notice enough people playing it to make it hard to find the mob I need that hasnt already been killed
[0:31:52] Ujai321: ie Subnautica has a 'survival' mode with hunger, and one without, and i turned that off immediately
[0:31:54] GreenArrowed: i'm finally on a palworld break
[0:31:59] Ujai321: *eg, not ie
[0:32:08] TotallyNotRaien: thats so actual self punishment... starting a lot of games at once
[0:32:09] elgoblina: sometimes the wow hardcore itch hits and EVERYTHING gets put on the back burner lol
[0:32:23] Jonboy4556: well I can honestly say BG3 is great
[0:32:29] wolfcloudchaser80: I've been playing Enshrouded, too. My cup runneth over for survival games lately, yeah.
[0:32:33] KingfisherGames: Once I'm done my Fallout New Vegas playthrough I'll start up a new run of BG3
[0:32:37] jeffdmk: lets go for a little swim famous last words
[0:33:23] Mangooooes: is death permanent in self-found? 🤔
[0:33:26] kynlaeh: i’ve even see high lvl warlocks drown so no one is immune
[0:33:29] cashthb: btw on the other side of the coin I can't find anything I want to play
[0:33:33] Ujai321: what is the silliest mistake you made so far?
[0:33:35] Ujai321: you cannot
[0:33:40] TotallyNotRaien: you did what???
[0:33:41] GreenArrowed: i don't think so
[0:33:47] TotallyNotRaien: hello? peta??
[0:34:08] saga_no: I use the little portraits on top of the screen to target the enemies in BG3
[0:34:12] apheelia96: I just got balders gate 3 and the combat style is new to me
[0:34:16] kags158: "i am new and overwhelmed' my new life motto lol
[0:34:21] cashthb: one sorc specs makes it so your spell don't friendly fire
[0:34:21] Ujai321: as you do
[0:34:24] Ujai321: the fishy ox
[0:34:26] RadioactiveBullfrog: RadioactiveBullfrog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! radioa2Love
[0:34:26] Streamlabs: radioactivebullfrog just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:34:29] GreenArrowed: looooool
[0:34:36] cashthb: Psychozel
[0:34:41] Ujai321: so who was that ox?
[0:35:02] Ujai321: oh right, you can speak to animals
[0:35:05] Ujai321: what did it say?
[0:35:08] Jonboy4556: you can find out in chapter 2
[0:35:23] Jonboy4556: no spoilers
[0:35:50] saga_no: That's kinda why I love BG3, though... you can take all the time you want /  need with it... and it's still a lot of stuff to do and explore
[0:36:00] Ujai321: but good to know if chat, for some reason, ever gets to meet you in person: dont be suspicious
[0:36:03] cashthb: did you speak with that cute squirrel near the gate? :) you should, especially if you play dark urge! :)
[0:36:07] Jonboy4556: Bg3 is so well crafted
[0:36:08] Ujai321: or you're DEAD
[0:36:54] apheelia96: BG3 is so pretty Im just new to turn based combat
[0:36:59] jeffdmk: that squirrel sounds nuts
[0:37:08] Jonboy4556: yeah the squirrels got attitude in the game
[0:37:19] elliongrey: Isn't there supposed to be hearthstone disc mount coming out soon?
[0:37:23] Zuldak: sadly the paris hilton bag is in shattrath
[0:37:28] elliongrey: For the anniversary event
[0:37:33] elliongrey: Oooooh
[0:37:34] elliongrey: ty! :D
[0:37:51] cashthb: wait, speaking of dark urge, are you playing it?
[0:37:55] susicue: morning guys, do you just create a new toon on the OG HC servers and select SSF?
[0:38:01] KingfisherGames: @Zuldak It's so crazy that the modern bags we get as just normal bags are bigger than the paris hilton bag now
[0:38:07] susicue: ok cool ty!
[0:38:23] KingfisherGames: They need to put her in Midnight and give her a new bag
[0:38:33] Ujai321: if i had to bet, i would put money on 'no dark urge'
[0:38:37] susicue: what server are yall playing on?
[0:39:04] Innvicta312: I really would like to play HC wow again but i heard it's kinda dead now
[0:40:04] Ujai321: what is this, water in a glass??
[0:40:29] justmyers: good morning Hazel!
[0:41:01] Ujai321: so, do you play with or without dark urge in BG3? (it would be on character creation, i believe)
[0:41:10] elliongrey: @Innvicta312 Eh for now. Most are playing SOD
[0:41:23] averageteacup: what does she eats?
[0:41:27] Greyzel: Lola is the name of my cat!! aw
[0:41:53] Innvicta312: @elliongrey I tried SoD and it didn't get me honestly.
[0:42:29] Ujai321: as far as i understand, it is a voice inside your head that wants you to do increasingly heinous things to your world
[0:42:35] Ujai321: and you can give in or resist
[0:42:57] GreenArrowed: there are some buffs
[0:43:08] Jonboy4556: Dark Urge is more connected to BG 1&2 and yes there are benefits
[0:43:08] Ujai321: probably. the game is very well crafted, as far as i can tell
[0:43:14] averageteacup: just noticed the Deathlog .. this is fun!
[0:43:33] Ujai321: holy moly you get whispers?
[0:43:38] Ujai321: what is going on
[0:44:37] Ujai321: the islands of death
[0:45:37] Ujai321: 'i killed the ox' 'i liked seeing people perish around me' very concerning
[0:46:20] GreenArrowed: oh man that music made me think your were in STV and i was like what is going on??
[0:46:29] cashthb: that is the point distribution, and not the vote count, so if someone where to vote for like 70k againts you yesterday that would have skewed id
[0:46:47] Ujai321: is this your first time here on this troll?
[0:48:48] Ujai321: ah, i was wondering about the raptors and the tiger
[0:49:10] McScooterson: go lola go
[0:49:35] jeffdmk: if you lost a character off stream and leveled a new one, do you think you could make it enough the same nobody would notice?
[0:50:23] sanguinette: Isn't that like buying your kid a replacement goldfish :-D
[0:50:25] saga_no: You'd have to make sure the *same bags* dropped on the new character though
[0:50:45] TotallyNotRaien: someone would expose you with your bags content or something
[0:50:55] cashthb: so you're saying this is a second troll?! I want my points back!
[0:51:16] Zuldak: well we would know if your character lost levels so you would have a bit of a timer to get back to at least where stream ended
[0:51:31] Ujai321: i know why. cause you're siiiiiiiiick
[0:51:38] apheelia96: cheater cheater pumpkin eater lol
[0:52:27] jeffdmk: why is the a rare from orginal wow that scales up to max level?
[0:53:35] cashthb: I wouldn't
[0:53:52] Ujai321: it's under construction, ok. you killed the workforce
[0:53:54] Zuldak: youve had 20 years to fix this blizz D:
[0:53:58] jeffdmk: Pridewing Patriarch is from original wow and spawn at whatever level you are
[0:55:04] apheelia96: im on Kul Tiras sailors and finding the really sticky glue a handy item
[0:56:01] LordOni: You could have death skipped to Org
[0:56:32] jele22: Hi Hazel, when do you think Blizzard will publish the release date for the war within? Its seems overdue for me ^^
[0:56:51] GreenArrowed: we haven't heard about the next patch yet, have we?
[0:57:02] LordOni: I death skipped in hardcore. Exactly once.

[0:58:20] cashthb: btw I kinda feel like vendoring violates the spirit of self found, you should mine your own currency!
[0:59:11] cinnatoasto_: Orgrimmar is super empty
[1:00:24] apheelia96: time to hydrate

[1:03:54] wolfcloudchaser80: I think maybe Kira is getting used to the routine of having to get scooped up when you return.
[1:04:13] GreenArrowed: i got the best hug from a (large) pit bull puppy this morning, so sweet
[1:04:58] kags158: Old Org is so jarring to see
[1:05:48] StipeNJ: whoa Lola is my dog's name
[1:06:47] witchhobbit: have you gone back to your level 40 warlock or hunter at all?
[1:07:00] showerbees: do you sit on a bench?
[1:08:24] witchhobbit: ah can’t switch them to self found? i guess that makes sense
[1:08:39] witchhobbit: self found is separate servers I’m guessing?
[1:09:02] cinnatoasto_: What IS this self found thing?
[1:09:10] witchhobbit: i see!
[1:09:23] jgbrit: Hey Hazel, just about to leave work. Are you feeling better today?
[1:09:51] Varezhka8: I wish u couldn't group up as well here
[1:10:24] jeffdmk: can the greens you make proc extra stam?
[1:10:25] Varezhka8: oh nice
[1:11:05] jgbrit: Ooff I just realised, you have to vendor greens too so you're not making bank on them 😒
[1:11:35] averageteacup: the green rope have Reinforced +8, never seen this before
[1:12:02] Zuldak: vendoring bears :/
[1:12:07] averageteacup: oooh
[1:12:09] averageteacup: i see
[1:12:37] Zuldak: gonna go see Dune today. Heard Austin Butler steals the show
[1:12:59] maladal: I don't recall. How high did Hazel get in the previous hardcore?
[1:13:08] Zuldak: try and find a double feature for parts 1 and 2?
[1:13:27] maladal: Character can't die if you never play them 4Head
[1:14:04] Zuldak: they will not ever make a movie on book 4
[1:14:07] Zuldak: you cant
[1:14:27] Viuh: have to get dvd , easier to rewatch :D
[1:15:18] Zuldak: it was amazing they made books 2/3 into a mini series
[1:15:49] cashthb: I don't get this dune stuff, if they are going to make movies out of old west wood game why not command & conquer, or red alert... they could even make a blade runner movie
[1:15:55] cashthb: that would be brazy
[1:16:33] cashthb: it's a book tho
[1:16:39] cashthb: not my thing
[1:16:42] Zuldak: @cashthb The dune books came out in the 60s. The westwood games were based on the 84 movie absed on the book
[1:16:42] ravenheart713: ravenheart713 subscribed at Tier 2. 
[1:16:42] Streamlabs: ravenheart713 just subscribed with Tier 2!
[1:16:57] Chronollo: I don't typically like sci-fi, but Dune is an exception, I wasn't a big fan of Star Wars movies, but really liked Dune movie
[1:17:18] Zuldak: if you want the quasi movie sequel to the westwood game, check out dune 2000 and emperor battle for dune
[1:17:23] GreenArrowed: @Chronollo oh that's so interesting. star wars is fantasy to me
[1:17:31] superab02: Hi hazel! I hope you are having a good saturday
[1:17:54] Zuldak: yeah the books explain things like 'why do they not use lasers for everything'
[1:18:03] GreenArrowed: i had to explain to someone that the dune movie was only part 1. they thought the story ended that way. that would have been awful.
[1:18:24] ryanskys: this is wow classic plus?
[1:18:40] cashthb: they could move in steel suits if they really wanted to
[1:18:43] Chronollo: Will they adapt all the books into movies? If so, how many parts would that even be lol
[1:18:55] apheelia96: I dont know what season of discovery really is
[1:19:20] GreenArrowed: @Zuldak i feel like they THINK they did explain it with the sparring scene and the poison fly thing, but i don't think it's clear for anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the old movie
[1:19:28] averageteacup: chests in Classic don't give exp ... i wish they do
[1:19:36] GreenArrowed: yea i think there's 3 movies
[1:19:38] Zuldak: @cashthb sill suits. Its basically a suit that captures all of your moisture and recycles it so you can live longer in the desert
[1:19:50] coffee814: what add on do you use for your bars?
[1:20:26] superab02: Is retail dry right now?
[1:20:40] ryanskys: how can I play this game with Hazel together?
[1:21:11] ryanskys: how much should I pay
[1:21:35] ryanskys: all right
[1:21:39] ryanskys: Ok then
[1:22:01] ravenheart713: Long time watcher, first time I'm in a good place to sub. I was the whisper earlier. Thank you for being a light and a comfort for the last few years, I know it's been pretty hard for everyone though. Goodluck! You've got this! :D
[1:22:08] superab02: Did you hear about the willy wonka experience in Glasgow? Just wanna see if it spread to canada too XD
[1:22:45] GreenArrowed: honestly anything related to willy wonka is horrifying
[1:23:11] GreenArrowed: no, i've heard it's not great
[1:23:14] superab02: I did, it is more of a musical rather than a movie.
[1:23:19] apheelia96: Its actually pretty cute
[1:23:35] GreenArrowed: possibly
[1:23:42] cashthb: btw I had some time to think about it, and a c&c movie with some ironically b tier cgi could be huge hit
[1:23:43] superab02: Youre a muse maybe
[1:23:44] daws001: i loved the new Wonka. i cried
[1:24:06] apheelia96: yeah the end made me tear up
[1:24:35] cashthb: yes, the aggresively b tier live action cut scenes were like the best feature of the series
[1:25:15] apheelia96: At first I thought it was just a remake and really its a musical prequel
[1:25:22] cashthb: in red alert 3 there's a scene where Tim Curry nearly breaks down laughing reading his lines
[1:25:26] Ujai321: Sophie Ellis Baxter's big hit, 'Murder on the Bag Slots'
[1:26:44] Ujai321: i said i wouldnt watch Dune before Dune 2 was out. i might have to now
[1:27:50] Ujai321: i meant more "until i can be certain it would be finished". also, if i was gonna watch it at home, i would get it from THE LIBRARY
[1:28:34] Jonboy4556: axes and staves i think
[1:28:47] Jonboy4556: fist weapons
[1:29:02] Jonboy4556: undercity i think
[1:29:05] iamtheolesen: Hunters don't do blunt weapons :(
[1:29:06] jgbrit: Just walked in from work, now I'm glad I over ordered yesterday. Chinese again tonight 😋
[1:29:08] Pathstrider: hunters cant use maces can thye?
[1:29:37] cashthb: staves  are blunt!
[1:29:45] Ujai321: interesting that tauren would teach you how to use guns
[1:29:51] cinnatoasto_: The quest is complete
[1:29:55] Ujai321: i have a hard time imagining them pulling a trigger
[1:30:09] GreenArrowed: yea i thought that was weird. i hate using guns in game, the bang sound is SO loud
[1:30:11] Ujai321: with their huge hands
[1:30:25] GreenArrowed: ooooh
[1:30:28] GreenArrowed: good green
[1:30:40] jgbrit: Hazel just won the weapon lottery
[1:30:41] Max_Winters_: hey hazel, giving favourite grandma today :D how are you
[1:30:41] Ujai321: i mean everything is for you
[1:30:50] GreenArrowed: i used to love dual wielding maces on my hunter in vanilla
[1:30:53] Ujai321: do hunters dual wield by default?
[1:31:18] GreenArrowed: you have to learn dual wield
[1:31:20] Pathstrider: dw at lvl20 no?
[1:31:36] jgbrit: Do you think they will have sneakily buffed the drop rates of greens for ssf?
[1:32:01] jgbrit: Good 👍
[1:32:21] cashthb: you def could back in cata (I used claws of torment/agony), dunno 'bout earlier
[1:32:27] Elrathir: Hello gamer
[1:32:51] Elrathir: can I just say that I think it's great that you named your crocolisk Lola
[1:32:56] Elrathir: that is a lovely name
[1:32:59] jgbrit: I think it's wierd that my retail hunter is using a gun but can tmog it as a bow
[1:33:23] ravenheart713: I love the way they waddle XD
[1:33:57] ravenheart713: She's doin her best lol
[1:34:20] 3Duxie: 6 legs huh...so its an insect?
[1:34:37] Ujai321: ah, you can learn dual wield at level 20, maybe?
[1:34:38] Quachiri: I kind of miss Hunters being able to have a bow/crossbow/gun and a one handed weapon for when combat became close range
[1:34:57] KingfisherGames: WHY ARE WE ALL SICK TODAY
[1:35:16] apheelia96: I just made a regular hardcore Gnome warlock
[1:35:43] apheelia96: I was sick last week and most of this week I had a lingering cough.
[1:35:45] Ujai321: remember your voidwalker?
[1:35:49] GreenArrowed: i've never levled a gnome, maybe i'll do that today
[1:36:07] Viuh: CoolCat
[1:36:11] Ujai321: honestly, you cant roll another lock. you are never gonna top Helgrave
[1:36:17] KingfisherGames: that's why all the streams have been so quiet lately! i had my volume on half through firefox
[1:36:24] KingfisherGames: *through the volume mixer
[1:36:53] apheelia96: I wish they had a quest reading addon for retail WOW! I love it.
[1:37:27] cashthb: mutebla tabs are the best browser feature in (somewhat) recent memory
[1:37:31] jgbrit: Have you been cooking?
[1:37:58] Ujai321: more water in another glass?
[1:38:16] Ujai321: eh, water with extra steps
[1:38:18] apheelia96: yes we need some more cooking streams hazelLove
[1:38:31] KingfisherGames: Any tips for soloing mechagon?
[1:38:57] Elrathir: I was gonna say "60 silver? You're siiiiiick" but you literally are
[1:39:34] ABigScaryDog: whats that bag addon?
[1:41:23] ravenheart713: During the initial hc launch I played  a tauren hunter...almost died to the Alli elites that prowl further south in the Barrens
[1:41:37] jgbrit: Aspect of the cheetah is such a downgrade in retail
[1:41:44] ravenheart713: I heard the dismount sound and just raaan
[1:41:56] KingfisherGames: I need to start making more food from the WoW Cookbook
[1:42:06] GreenArrowed: i miss soul shape
[1:42:27] KingfisherGames: @HazelNuttyGames I learned something fun from screwing up one of those recipes
[1:42:50] KingfisherGames: If you want to make a sheetcake, just use a brownie mix and cut the baking powder to 1/3rd of what the recipe calls for
[1:43:15] KingfisherGames: It's still pretty tasty, it just doesn't rise so much
[1:43:21] KingfisherGames: So you can use that to make layers pretty easily
[1:43:53] jgbrit: They're not free for the poor animals you're brutally slaying for their hides 😂
[1:44:17] GreenArrowed: i forgot i made a tauren warlock named warlox
[1:44:22] KingfisherGames: I got around 290 mounts last year
[1:44:28] KingfisherGames: I averaged more than 1 mount every 2 days
[1:46:11] jgbrit: Really? I got it this weekend and I only did about 5 dreams seeds and they weren't even mine, I literally contributed 1 dewdrop to a maxed out seed lol
[1:46:37] jgbrit: Ahh okay I didn't know
[1:46:42] cashthb: won't your cardigan get yucky if you always cough in your sleve?
[1:46:45] GreenArrowed: like the frostsaber quest
[1:47:01] KingfisherGames: I much prefer the mechagnomes to the regular gnomes
[1:47:02] toobaked1987: The new peacock from the trading post is so pretty
[1:47:11] KingfisherGames: They have less annoying voice actors
[1:47:19] KingfisherGames: And none of them are Tinkmaster Overspark

[1:47:42] russtrotter: can you talk thought process on going lw/skin vs herb/alch or mining/engineering?
[1:47:50] sleighher: Heya Hazel how is it going today ?
[1:48:41] russtrotter: ooo good point on bag space
[1:49:13] GreenArrowed: oooh coziest socks
[1:49:29] averageteacup: I remember when crafting larger bags was so exciting :D
[1:49:40] GreenArrowed: i was about to say knitting yourself some fishing socks might be a nice intro back to knitting, but knitting socks is tedious
[1:50:03] Elrathir: Are you aiming on going all the way to 60?
[1:50:22] Elrathir: wise
[1:51:26] GreenArrowed: spicy soup
[1:51:40] cashthb: nothing garlic related that's for sure...
[1:51:58] wolfcloudchaser80: Could just take a long warm bath for a similar steam effect.
[1:52:15] GreenArrowed: oh nooooo
[1:52:46] KingfisherGames: @HazelNuttyGames i learned how to do the mechagon solo
[1:52:57] wolfcloudchaser80: Pour the boiling water into the tub!
[1:53:00] GreenArrowed: i have a warming eye mask for my migraines that also feels good when i have a sinus infection
[1:53:17] GreenArrowed: yea
[1:53:18] KingfisherGames: helps that i main a monk so i can use transcendence to speed up the trip up the pylons
[1:54:37] averageteacup: Damad the Shaman .. 13 levels!
[1:54:51] cashthb: did I ramble about how great idea the highlanger remake with Henry Cavill is?
[1:55:10] cashthb: yeah, lander
[1:55:12] GreenArrowed: man, cross roads is going to be wild
[1:55:18] saga_no: Is he still doing his 40k thing?
[1:55:18] cashthb: no, it's in production
[1:55:22] Zamnest: Hey Hazel, what's the addon that shows pets' abilities?
[1:55:40] Kalaila_: I always felt weird being a hunter with skinning/LW. my pet has to follow me and watch me skin their brethren .
[1:55:44] Elrathir: You should head over to Ashenvale :) Easy leveling! :) Many friendly elves to help you! :)
[1:55:53] Zamnest: Thaank youu
[1:56:13] cashthb: the og movie had a great premise but it didn't age gracefully
[1:56:20] heldtheline: 'don't look, lola, don't look' hazelOmg
[1:57:32] cashthb: what if there's a pink one? or a gnome colored one?

[1:59:24] dorikdordor: Nerhzul
[1:59:25] brunmin1: ner'zhul?
[1:59:29] GreenArrowed: nur zul?
[2:00:03] brunmin1: Ned Zul
[2:01:13] jgbrit: When you get to the higher levels gold just happens to you
[2:02:23] cashthb: just disengage the fall damage
[2:02:35] Elrathir: don't be scared of falling in the pit :) it might be fun! :) might be a ball pit! :)
[2:03:21] Zuldak: They should have ball pits for the 25 plus kids
[2:03:27] jgbrit: I got a scroll of stam from a mob and accidentally buffed a travelling salesman in Loch modan with it. I legit could have cried
[2:03:27] cashthb: track skills might also be pretty usefull in caves
[2:04:05] Zuldak: Idk adult playgrounds sound fun. Like obsticle courses
[2:04:38] Zuldak: I remember being super bummed when I started middle school and there was no play structure to climb
[2:05:08] jgbrit: I hope you wake up feeling better tomorrow 💕
[2:05:29] Zuldak: The smart move is to go to uc and do those quests yeah.
[2:05:32] GreenArrowed: feel better! get some cozy moose time
