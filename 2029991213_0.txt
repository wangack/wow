[1:04:40] TheDastardlyD: GMs however :)
[1:04:44] craboskai: too much but bad takes KEKL
[1:04:45] TheZetsy: all the cracked devs working on sod

[1:04:59] nickas31: this hunter priest nerf is meh
[1:05:13] ablib2: aggrend has been great
[1:05:20] TheEndIsNear777: TweetGgrend
[1:05:22] Dazzr_: yeah, where is the survey about their GM's? lol
[1:05:27] Bearrdman: part of the reason why sod is doing so well imo, communicaion as well as being on top of changes
[1:05:31] Dazzr_: or bots
[1:05:31] nickas31: ashenvale is cool I need to get the mount on one of my toons very neat
[1:05:33] JakeDive: Like Aaron Rodgers takes
[1:05:37] chunky1983: they are adjusting classes purly on pvp is my only complaint
[1:05:42] TheEndIsNear777: Aggrend? more like Tweetggrend ba dum tss
[1:05:48] AceOfFlame: yes
[1:05:49] Leviosor: yes
[1:05:50] linkitcraig: yeah
[1:05:50] Dazzr_: yes
[1:05:51] nickas31: runes could be better
[1:05:52] Lionkingler1: mage healing is insanely broken
[1:05:54] person1029492: yes, but caster runes are weak
[1:05:55] OptimusBanana420: it needs work
[1:05:56] RockyMountainOyster: somewhat
[1:05:57] Farenheight451: hunters are going to tank this survey KEKW
[1:05:57] craboskai: mid
[1:05:58] Bearrdman: could be better
[1:05:59] harvenius: runes are a bit lame
[1:05:59] linkitcraig: some are useless
[1:05:59] tussmack: spells to broken
[1:06:02] vakuga_: not bad for a first go
[1:06:02] zaebot3000: Its alright. Some are pretty fun
[1:06:02] mrcworld: hard to tell without all of them
[1:06:03] nickas31: I do not like that hunter rune that they just nerfed even more
[1:06:03] TheZetsy: fun ideas
[1:06:07] colson_133: yes except some
[1:06:10] nickas31: kill command is not the same as it is in retail
[1:06:11] chunky1983: tank druids lol
[1:06:12] wookieenthal: theyre okay
[1:06:13] colson_133: warr runes feel good when you learn to play it
[1:06:15] noChance219: Ehhh. Some are very chore-like
[1:06:18] Harles_: runes in the future need to fix certain talents problems
[1:06:21] mystory2d: lone wolf for the hunter , is a grind at the ratchet dealer
[1:06:22] colson_133: hunter runes feel amazing except some were nerfed to oblivion
[1:06:26] JakeDive: Runes are ruined retail cash grabs
[1:06:27] TheDastardlyD: shammy tank ruin necessary
[1:06:32] TheDastardlyD: rune
[1:06:33] euly999: Yeah that shit is annoyinh
[1:06:36] euly999: no cap
[1:06:37] ohkay710: its an mmo
[1:06:38] darkone_br: rune nerf inc
[1:06:40] colson_133: the feeling of annoyingly difficult rune quests is like class quests from vanilla
[1:06:40] nickas31: runes should be easier to get
[1:06:43] nickas31: and better
[1:06:43] butterzugzug: a one time thing, thats ok
[1:06:47] wookieenthal: I hate spending gold to get them but whatever
[1:06:52] chunky1983: yeah i think the ratchet one is the only terrible one
[1:06:55] bone555: ;)
[1:06:59] JakeDive: Classic wow broken
[1:07:01] noChance219: Yeah the Ratchet one is trash.
[1:07:14] SssnakePliskin: try getting starsurge at level 15
[1:07:22] nickas31: I do not think thats the issue
[1:07:25] harvenius: why didnt they just do talents instead of runes, seems lame
[1:07:27] linkitcraig: i think 2 slots
[1:07:28] nickas31: thats kind of the point of SOD
[1:07:30] Farenheight451: i got starsurge at level 5 worth it
[1:07:39] Lionkingler1: 2 per phase
[1:07:43] savagelo256: they will prob add new runes for old slots
[1:07:43] JakeDive: Starsurge owned must be a dev class
[1:07:45] bat3r: That's too much i think
[1:07:46] colson_133: that's a lotta runes
[1:07:46] SssnakePliskin: solo?
[1:07:55] craboskai: and then at 60 you have one slot where you can equip any rune YEP
[1:07:59] nickas31: obv devs play druid
[1:08:03] mrcworld: why not more runes in the same slot?
[1:08:12] beology: not sure they'll add slots over just more runes in existing slots
[1:08:12] Lionkingler1: sod is probably 2 years
[1:08:17] deezyjc: need more passive runes
[1:08:20] Leviosor: MAGES RISE UP DinoDance
[1:08:21] ablib2: more slots is a given
[1:08:21] bomzzwtf: impossible to balance
[1:08:25] angrybradger: facts
[1:08:25] colson_133: lmao
[1:08:28] colson_133: >too many buttons
[1:08:29] nickas31: they going to do different armor slots beology
[1:08:31] Lionkingler1: yea 100%
[1:08:31] angrybradger: 3 buttons
[1:08:35] thormoz22: they are DICKS
[1:08:38] colson_133: hunter rotation is 2 buttons
[1:08:40] JakeDive: Can't rune a bad game
[1:08:40] noChance219: EZ Passives
[1:08:48] Lionkingler1: need to have 7 passive ones
[1:08:56] ElPablochele: Naaah if you want passive runes go play BFA
[1:08:57] colson_133: agreed tho actually
[1:09:01] colson_133: passive runes preferred
[1:09:02] JakeDive: I have massive Hunter burnout
[1:09:04] uniquetwitchname_1372: you say that but hunter with the full passive runes and or macroable runes sucks man
[1:09:06] harvenius: more buttons and less damage :)
[1:09:08] nickas31: isnt starsurge an ability that already existed in retail?
[1:09:11] sighwarlock: Felguard rune Prayge
[1:09:18] darkone_br: yes more fun pls
[1:09:23] colson_133: hunter feels good but i want another button to press that does dmg number on BM
[1:09:28] TogaTig: ;)
[1:09:28] ElPablochele: We don't want azerite traits, we want abilities
[1:09:32] nickas31: yeh hunters need a buff
[1:09:34] JakeDive: 3 buttons oh look I have to melee weave now honey LMAO
[1:09:34] Lionkingler1: catchup has to be changed for sure
[1:09:34] colson_133: it's literally hunter's mark, auto shot, multi shot, send pet, ad infinitum
[1:09:35] nickas31: not enough buttons to press
[1:09:36] person1029492: they should make passives that buff the low dmg, expensive to cast vanilla spells
[1:09:40] saund: thats a very good point
[1:09:40] uniquetwitchname_1372: hunter gameplay is literally classic era gameplay
[1:09:44] Lionkingler1: 100%
[1:09:47] Leviosor: YES
[1:09:47] mrcworld: yes 10000%

[1:10:01] feardotrun: no go farm it
[1:10:03] Leviosor: for the previous phase
[1:10:03] JakeDive: Hunter sod was so bad
[1:10:06] kaladhras: they could add a catch-all quest
[1:10:07] nickas31: it should just be easir to get it
[1:10:08] colson_133: each class has 1 MAYBE 2-3 runes that actually take time/effort
[1:10:08] indocl0ud: they should add them to the cash shop Kappa
[1:10:09] savagelo256: so swipe to win?
[1:10:11] bisene14: no

[1:10:30] mystory2d: maybe if its the same class
[1:10:32] sigilfish: account bound rune tokens from raid bosses ez clap
[1:10:36] linkitcraig: level 60 currency from dungeon+ to buy older runes
[1:10:37] mrcworld: just cherry pick what you need
[1:10:38] ElPablochele: why would you have 8 characters? that's insane
[1:10:42] whatever: THIS GUY
[1:10:47] nickas31: Its a fun thing to do when every phase comes out
[1:10:51] whatever: BUY POWERGUM
[1:10:53] ablib2: the rep rune and gold rune from the shredder is annoying on alts.  maybe those.  but every other should just be discovered
[1:10:55] JakeDive: My 12 yr old sperg lil bro could make a better game with $500
[1:10:56] Woawiee: i just thought of this! let us pay real money for them, yeah!

[1:13:27] JamesRig: When he had tons of magic resist
[1:13:28] nickas31: thanks Beard
[1:13:29] Lionkingler1: literally day 1 it was maybe hard
[1:13:37] ablib2: it was only hard trying to figure out the strat.  once the strat was figured out, it's easy.
[1:13:38] colson_133: grab BFD sharpening stone if you're really worried
[1:13:39] madgarlicjr: pre pop a shadow pot and a fap , have a couple kickers, EZ
[1:13:40] Slesky: oh shit yea first lockout we got hard stopped at Kelris
[1:13:45] pottatowtv: maybe if you don't use free action potions at all?
[1:13:51] B4NJ33: i can see wiping on kelris if you have a subpar comp and really bad gear early on
[1:13:54] dodgydad33: unsat
[1:14:02] Snaketrap: ICANT
[1:14:02] B4NJ33: but after like 2-3 lockouts, there is just no way
[1:14:05] ablib2: I love ashenvale.  lol.  I spend all my time there
[1:14:08] nickas31: ashenvale is not fun
[1:14:10] Utmost777: HUH
[1:14:11] colson_133: shadow pot and 1/2 members with kick/interrupt nullifies Kelris
[1:14:12] therealrickdiculous: event is mid but the world pvp in sod has been good
[1:14:12] Bearrdman: and they're about to ruin STV FeelsBadMan
[1:14:16] nickas31: just a rep grind
[1:14:18] colson_133: the rest is a DPS check
[1:14:23] Blepox: true yes true
[1:14:28] darkone_br: its a good way to farm ws rep

[1:14:35] rocknsake: STV is a giant clusterfuck anyway, not much to ruin :)
[1:14:38] deezyjc: i bet they are going try to reinvent hellfire peninsula event
[1:14:39] colson_133: 3v3 arena would save PvP
[1:14:41] colson_133: yes
[1:14:43] nickas31: they should have done it in Hillsbrad
[1:14:43] Lionkingler1: hopefully rbg
[1:14:43] colson_133: PLZ
[1:14:44] mrcworld: that would be pog fr
[1:14:45] sighwarlock: didnt they said they didnt want to
[1:14:51] Pix93: really wish they would add arenas
[1:14:56] nickas31: goes to show you the game is Ally favored
[1:14:58] Bearrdman: 3v3 arenas at gurubashi PogChamp
[1:15:06] colson_133: RBG would be cool if their "design philosophy" prohibits classic arena despite BC classic and BC arena existing
[1:15:26] Leviosor: @nickas31 right lmaooo

[1:16:06] savagelo256: @nickas31 by taking the portal we‚Äôve always taken
[1:16:17] savbrah: 8 weeks is too long
[1:16:22] madgarlicjr: yeah phase1 kinda dying
[1:16:25] Droek_: phase 1 WAY too long
[1:16:25] nickas31: have you seen how hard ally make it sometimes for horde to get to BFD entrance?
[1:16:26] NutterCircus: Lowest sub is 2 months LUL
[1:16:29] Lionkingler1: 8 lockouts
[1:16:30] colson_133: anyone mount gold tip: grind STV beasts from 30-40 and nothing else. vendor the claws/pelts. now you have 100g.
[1:16:31] ElPablochele: i still don't have my epic sword
[1:16:33] smokesnomoe: i liked it
[1:16:36] crouder: even the most casual dad with  kids and 30mins to play is bored
[1:16:44] butterzugzug: phase 1 had holiday seasons so many casual players were not gaming, so it's ok
[1:16:48] darkone_br: i have 6 classes 25 and 2 more almost 25 lol its too far betwen phases
[1:16:50] Leviosor: @nickas31 thats on BOTH sides its a pvp zone
[1:16:53] colson_133: I've run BFD 3x on Hunter and gotten jack shit for loot but crafted gloves. they need to work the loot table

[1:17:11] TheEndIsNear777: i GOTTA try it YEP
[1:17:22] nickas31: they should have just made SM into a raid
[1:17:27] madgarlicjr: my dad made me play it
[1:17:28] KrotonGG: Asmongold and I are best friends by the way
[1:17:36] Buttsworth: if my favorite streamer StaySafe plays it.. I got to play it
[1:17:37] colson_133: whereas on Warrior I've done one and already got Fathomblade, blue quest shield, turtle armor, Shifting Silver Breastplate, and everyone wants me to offtank and top DPS
[1:17:40] Slesky: starforge pcs have it automatically installed Kappa
[1:17:41] NutterCircus: First 2 weeks were fun.
[1:17:49] madgarlicjr: KEKBye youtuber

[1:18:18] Doribob1: 1 raiders from Doribob1 have joined! 
[1:18:22] colson_133: not that Hunters are bad, but I'm concerned if they don't change their scaling it will be mid/trash DPS at 40/50/60
[1:18:33] colson_133: y tho
[1:18:33] n0fragtv: why ?
[1:18:38] colson_133: ???

[1:18:54] tussmack: yea wouldnt mind it either
[1:18:54] mrcworld: Delay 3 days max
[1:19:05] colson_133: preventing people who are on winter break/vacation from work from enjoying their damn raid
[1:19:07] OptimusBanana420: NEET
[1:19:09] mrcworld: 25-40 is not that long lol
[1:19:12] NutterCircus: 20 year old quests... KEKL

[1:19:26] SuperLost89: doesnt bother me at all, and im someone that will speed level
[1:19:26] colson_133: if ur not pink parsing on day 2 gnomer what are you even doing
[1:19:33] colson_133: absolutely freaking not
[1:19:34] oloflame: actually a good idea
[1:19:36] madgarlicjr: if people want to speed lvl and rush the raid it doesn't effect me so i don't care either way
[1:19:39] Lionkingler1: OMEGALUL 60% of community are casuals
[1:19:41] pottatowtv: Good idea for sure, but don't really care enough
[1:19:43] lulle17: na. the best period is when gamers hit cap and casuals still level
[1:19:51] GrimRx_0: YES
[1:19:55] colson_133: 1 week ehhh it's not like i'm gonna raid week 1 anyway i'm medium casual

[1:20:18] Frexibo: if you had to choose?
[1:20:35] NutterCircus: First 3 days are just fighting for tags. So that is a thing, but I dont think they should delay.
