[0:16:59] fleshlight420: @Raikubest many ppl say mage is too weak this season in arena, is this true or fake news?
[0:17:13] asap_Coffey: "many ppl"
[0:17:23] man0litos: Its not too weak, but its not comparable with top tier casters
[0:17:54] windi14: missed 2 boxes from fail
[0:18:26] truhan89: wonder if they will nerf rdruid and rshaman
[0:18:27] haiikilul: this mage is boosted or renamed?

[0:23:50] nRD22: ***
[0:23:53] mrturkishpeter: Anyone who says you can go high as arcane in this shaman dk shit in soloq just lies. No way someone with fresh mmr can make it high rating with arcane mage in soloq. Fuck this game.
[0:24:01] Limmee_wow: @Skyler33 "that third guy" XD
[0:25:22] n0tDef1ned: not having addong better character panel so you can see missing enchants sockets etc  FeelsWeirdMan
[0:26:08] citricxy: bro I was the guy in the arena queue waiting for you … you let me down man they pwned me
[0:26:57] obizdub: Raiku how come you was benched most games ? in awc
[0:26:57] mrturkishpeter: Well. Double resto shaman, dk feral dh. THey always kill eachother, and there is no way for me to win in that lobby.
[0:26:57] skylightxo: SP stream when?
[0:27:16] man0litos: why is that show? Maybe in 3s yeah. But the early rotation of their spells is horrible to play against @Raikubest
[0:27:49] mrturkishpeter: its very surprising to hear arcane coutners dk. I have no fucking idea how is that true :D
[0:28:03] obizdub: Raiku is dh stronger than mage atm then for climbing cr
[0:28:16] Nalaa_3: dtbmarHELP
[0:28:45] mrturkishpeter: but yea, in general i dont have problems with dk as arcane, but that double shaman feral dh shit, there is no way to win as arcane.
[0:28:45] Castorcato: I go away for like a month and DH is no.1 again? What changed?
[0:28:50] obizdub: ye gonna gear one got a new pc so I can actually have frame rate
[0:28:51] Emiliiooz: u practise x2 dh with whazz?
[0:29:04] obizdub: !addon
[0:29:05] mrturkishpeter: @Castorcato nothing changed. Thats the problem.
[0:30:41] obizdub: did he even glimpse
[0:30:53] Deathmarkedx: imagine a team pulls out the double dh and rolls over everyone
[0:31:15] n0tDef1ned: you ahve time for liek 3 skirmishes until you have to be in the superbloom
[0:31:21] obizdub: played double dh in season 2 and farmed 2s upto 1700 lmao
[0:31:23] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Raiku
[0:31:29] Icetomeetyu: shouldnt whaazz naturally be a better dh as its melee
[0:31:39] n0tDef1ned: after it comes defend bla bla against theonslaughter than you have time for 1,2 more
[0:31:44] celeryjuicer: what is arcane actually weak against then?
[0:31:56] sheepbiter: feesh
[0:32:47] obizdub: hope we get recolors in season 4
[0:33:02] obizdub: the lock dest set got scuffed
[0:33:46] albert7452: @Raikubest how much do you enjoy pve?
[0:33:48] obizdub: whoever chose the set bonus should be shot
[0:33:55] haiikilul: @Raikubest Why did u make another mage?
[0:34:36] n0tDef1ned: because he wants to play mage and that's the only way he can
[0:34:37] obizdub: if precog procs does it make arcane missiles hit faster ?
[0:34:44] n0tDef1ned: because he cant q with other mages
[0:35:26] Thaaranduil: @Raikubest I hope u guys get the W in the tournament. I never thought how weird it would be to not see u guys at the top everytime, it is hard to believe, u guys are the best, keep it up and wish u the best (missing mehx alreeady lol)
[0:35:39] n0tDef1ned: issue is you qwill climb soo fast that in 2 days you will end up with long qs
[0:35:42] MonsterhunterP: did you level it urself @Raikubest ? or boost
[0:36:57] haiikilul: Do you think the activity in arenas is really down and going downhill?
[0:37:31] Dexlol123: mastery above 90 is useless as mage?
[0:37:35] Bashy_89: do you know who smiteJ is ? @Raikubest
[0:37:39] Dexlol123: on rmd into some matchups?
[0:37:57] Zenlyn: would u leak it to us if you knew there would be changes or mmr buffs? @Raikubest
[0:38:37] albert7452: !playlist
[0:38:41] albert7452: !song
[0:39:11] pleebiceps: @Raikubest Yoo what`s your fav mage spec to play  ?
[0:39:46] citricxy: bro you quit the gym?
[0:40:05] skylightxo: @Raikubest I dont know why you're not in convo as the nr1 player world, and it's always Whaazz/Mehh, when honestly you're the best player of them all :D
[0:40:24] mrturkishpeter: @Dexlol123 Wait a sec. How do you get 90 mastery as mage lol? :D
[0:40:35] n0tDef1ned: @skylightxo bro not sure what convo you weere listening, it must be na weebs or something, but raiku is ALWAYS in the convo for the goats
[0:40:36] Akrololz: wheres Satoru
[0:40:40] MonsterhunterP: takes some time till she comes there again
[0:40:40] Akrololz: u fking weeb? @Raikubest
[0:41:00] Zenlyn: ur phased, relog
[0:41:03] Zenlyn: maybe?
[0:41:03] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Raiku
[0:42:06] skylightxo: @n0tDef1ned He is never in the convo dude, dont be ridiculous. It's always like Mehh, whaazz, snutz etc. But if there's one player that has overshadowed BY FAR others on his class, it's Raiku. By far. Not a single mage comes close. But Whaazz isnt by far the best rogue, maybe he isnt even better than Avizura or Pika (im saying maybe), but people still praise him more than Raiku
[0:42:42] citricxy: @skylightxo bro you need to touch some grass
[0:42:51] skylightxo: @citricxy Says the twitch chatter
[0:43:32] hulaballu: How was the Retri/DH/rshaman session yesteday?
[0:44:55] n0tDef1ned: @skylightxo again, change the convo you are listening since clearly you are watching people who are clueless, typical twitch chatter
[0:45:16] pleebiceps: Guys in what expension mage was the best pvp wise ?
[0:45:31] Zenlyn: tyler1 > zeus cos tyler1 is a bigger streamer OMEGALUL
[0:45:32] Zenlyn: some shit like that
[0:45:38] n0tDef1ned: he's maybe bigger streamer so more people say it, but you shouldn't watch typical twitch as a source
[0:45:51] Zenlyn: yee it was just a random example
[0:46:06] n0tDef1ned: clickz in wow is insane
[0:46:13] ㄺㄻ: WHAT clix is literally one of the best players on game actually
[0:46:22] sistahfistah1: MONGRAAL
[0:46:24] sistahfistah1: POGGERS
[0:46:32] skylightxo: @n0tDef1ned Dude more people saying it is still more people saying it. It doesnt matter "where" they say it LUL
[0:46:36] n0tDef1ned: ye i know, im trolling ahha
[0:46:42] dazed_lepew: the goat
[0:46:53] likewizex: @Raikubest  i play ele dh rdru in 3s and seem to hit a wall at 2.2 of lock/rsham/dh and just cant beat it unless they throw - what would you do vs this comp?
[0:46:56] skylightxo: Who is Clix?
[0:46:59] skylightxo: Lol player?
[0:47:05] sistahfistah1: no csgo
[0:47:30] pixor74: @skylightxo dancer
[0:48:02] n0tDef1ned: @skylightxo but why would you care about a random twitch chatter saying the f? you listen to some people that actually have som eknowledge, not from ppl that are 1.5k
[0:48:05] sistahfistah1: SONG NAME?
[0:48:39] HaasFast: @skylightxo bruh ur next lvl delush. Maro, Thesia, Kubzy Wealthyman many mages just as good as raiku if not better sometimes
[0:48:48] Zenlyn: loool
[0:48:53] Zenlyn: dis convo
[0:49:01] skylightxo: @n0tDef1ned Even "people with knowledge" say it, dont be funny now :)
[0:49:08] skylightxo: @HaasFast AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAH
[0:49:10] n0tDef1ned: @skylightxo who, give me name
[0:49:18] parzivaaaaaaaal: any other spec can learn from ret? go 50% vers,or stupid
[0:49:25] skylightxo: @n0tDef1ned Lontar? There's one
[0:49:38] n0tDef1ned: @skylightxo lontar said that raiku isn't one of the best players in the world?
[0:49:40] Zenlyn: lontar mage would gap legit every other mage in the world
[0:49:44] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[0:49:45] n0tDef1ned: @Zenlyn can confirm
[0:49:45] Zenlyn: u guys havnt seen his blink db's
[0:49:47] n0tDef1ned: factually correct
[0:49:52] n0tDef1ned: dont google lontar mage
[0:50:17] sistahfistah1: i googled lontar mage and a twitter post of him complaining about mage buffs popped up
[0:50:39] nonamebomjx: Cant wait Kappa
[0:50:44] Zenlyn: give mage evanesence or w/e it was called in wod
[0:50:46] skylightxo: @n0tDef1ned No, are you stupid? I said he didnt say raiku is THE best player, which is fine to say, but I'm saying its just interesting considering he is more successful than say whaazz or mehh
[0:50:46] Zenlyn: that was rlly fun
[0:50:57] Braunijs: Cant wait for the tomorrows balance changes (SOD)
[0:51:08] praxtv: bruh gotta meet expectations of us perma rivals judgement
[0:51:08] nonamebomjx: Kappa
[0:51:10] praxtv: L0l
[0:51:19] HaasFast: @skylightxo holy fk ur on this guys cock. what ur saying is just not true
[0:51:31] Icetomeetyu: will there be any more buffs and nerfs before ssn end
[0:51:52] n0tDef1ned: @skylightxo you smoking some good shit my guy, I said he didn't say raiku is The best, he might hagve the opinion that whaaz is better, but i highly doubt he doesn't put raiku at the top
[0:51:53] Icetomeetyu: otherwise might make a dh Kappa
[0:51:54] skylightxo: @HaasFast Ok buddy.
[0:52:11] Braunijs: what does yozora mean
[0:52:25] n0tDef1ned: @Braunijs night sky
[0:52:30] n0tDef1ned: according to google
[0:53:54] Zenlyn: why dont mages play blue dragon soles like hpriest
[0:53:55] Zenlyn: genuinely
[0:53:59] Zenlyn: its just BETTER than that belt
[0:54:54] Zenlyn: it gives 350 intellect on every spellcast AT MINIMUM, and if u dont cast anything a sec or get cc'd it stacks up
[0:54:58] Zenlyn: any spells i guess is the downside
[0:54:59] Zenlyn: but
[0:55:02] Zenlyn: that belt has 33% uptime?
[0:55:10] Zenlyn: boots have 100% uptime at 350 intellect (MINIMUM)
[0:55:18] sistahfistah1: i dont like how casters dont cast anymore Stare
[0:55:41] Zenlyn: yes but 33% uptime on 650 vs 100% uptime on 350x700x1.5k or however much it is specifically
[0:56:27] ElodenTv: what mage comps do u think work in this rshaman meta?
[0:57:58] Zenlyn: ye legit the only downside is it'll use a stack no matter if its offensive spell or not, BUT it continues stacking even while ur using the stacks so every gcd is buffed by a minimum of 350 intellect
[0:58:39] drporkback: chant for belt
[0:58:40] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Raiku

[0:58:52] unimonosolo: how do u feel about being chan's pc background?
[0:59:00] imnotagodx: why did raiku reroll to mage?
[0:59:15] imnotagodx: wait holy shit that transmog looked sexy as fuck
[0:59:32] n0tDef1ned: must admit raiku mog game is good usually
[0:59:44] imnotagodx: @n0tDef1ned agreed agreed
[1:00:08] Cvarks: 💀
[1:01:04] Izostarx: just throw on some old school elite mog, those are the best
[1:01:26] praxtv: @Zenlyn tbh, got little control over the belt proc too
[1:01:42] praxtv: is kinda impossible to actually align it
[1:01:58] Fadrox93: @Raikubest how come, that your never stream woltk arena?
[1:02:11] sarent02: i wana touch ur white pale skin
[1:02:20] Thesia_: wrong class lad
[1:02:22] praxtv: think the boots are defo worth a try
[1:02:26] haiikilul: @Raikubest  Is dynamic macro in curseforge?
[1:02:50] Thesia_: is this a fresh 0 mmr q?
[1:03:24] Cvarks: i had to use a fresh mage to be able to shuf this ssn
[1:03:24] sarent02: plays mage gets 2.7 > makes new mage gets 2.7
[1:03:27] Cvarks: cant do the gigga qs
[1:03:30] Izostarx: first pop was 130 minutes or something
[1:03:33] Thesia_: yea the move is to make a stream char til its too high
[1:03:34] Thesia_: then delete it
[1:03:36] Thesia_: and go again
[1:03:50] JoeFernandes123: playing alt, when is main dh queues
[1:04:19] Izostarx: I guess double account is the move for you
[1:04:30] EstexX28: @raikubest just buy ring from auctionhöuse with haste and socket it
[1:04:33] sarent02: bro is actully suffering from succes
[1:04:45] sarent02: too good for his own well being

[1:05:24] mrturkishpeter: @haiikilul wHAT DYNAMIC MACRO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
[1:05:33] mrturkishpeter: sorry for the caps, ice nova bind :D
[1:06:01] grris: you think whaaz can get aboth 1,2k as ret today?
[1:06:13] mrturkishpeter: no, i mean i accidentally wrote with caps, because thats my ice nova, just left shuffle :D
[1:06:20] nonamebomjx: ahahahahah
[1:06:38] sistahfistah1: i thought he was a really good player ziqoHmm
[1:06:53] sistahfistah1: shuffle rating = skill
[1:06:55] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Raiku
[1:07:22] Zenlyn: doesnt he only play mage lock tho
[1:08:02] Zenlyn: faster spellsteals to tilt cdew faster
[1:08:06] praxtv: kinda like having a bit of mastery too
[1:08:16] praxtv: but the thing is, theoretically, more haste = more tier procs
[1:08:22] saubur: pvper mentality, the more haste the better no matter what
[1:08:33] saubur: logic is flawed in modern xpacs
[1:08:43] praxtv: feels kinda unplayable without verse rn tbh
[1:08:59] praxtv: well, because you can use more clearcasts per sec
[1:09:06] praxtv: theoretically
[1:09:20] praxtv: true
[1:09:24] parzivaaaaaaaal: most NA top rets go 50% vers lol
[1:10:06] Cvarks: imp barrier at 1500?

[1:22:47] jamminlove: You playing s9 yea?
[1:22:47] skylightxo: If solo que is about 30 min wait time, you play 6 rounds (every round is a match), that's maybe 50 minutes total, which is pretty much what 6 matches in normal 3v3 can take (especially in a damp season)
[1:22:52] Zenlyn: raiku gna be a reaction streamer soon

[1:26:32] fefefen: how big they are?
[1:26:51] nsensex: @Raikubest what do u play outside of wow?

[3:47:46] Arcanocrystal: just git gud
[3:47:46] LubD5: I’ve played on and off DF , but mainly healers and I’d like to try some caster now. I’m most interested in SP/Destro/Arcane but can’t decide which one is most worth to grind and play. Which one is most fun and has good toolkit ? It looks like Arcane is fun but it’s hardest one to play ? Melee meta is not helping indeed.
