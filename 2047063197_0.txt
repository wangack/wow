[2:53:32] Heero_Effect: I think Nintendo needs to let another studio try making a Pokémon game. game freak has struggled with the change to 3D
[2:53:39] Wulfgrym: @Molvonos oh didn't know about the limited heat that sucks
[2:53:41] schlongconnery39: Hey, when you got to accept the award at the Raiders game, who were the playing? Didn't get to hear what that experience was like for you.
[2:54:18] PvtHudson093: Nintendo/Pokemon has not really innovated since it came out 20 years ago. People have been wanting a true open world pokemon games
[2:54:26] Molvonos: @Wulfgrym Yea.  There are limitations on heat/cool sources.  My Huge Rock Egg had the same issue.  That's how I learned.  I had 5 firepits and a fire can around it, always was 'a lil cool'
[2:54:37] reggiepowa: my guess is it will end up like fall guys

[2:58:13] Miguel85NYC: Pokémon needs to make better games
[2:58:24] valianya: IF Nintendo Acts, they will only take action if they're certain they'll win.  If they haven't announced anything yet it means they don't have a case currently.
[2:58:28] raldrik: Honestly Palworld could have already agreed to a revshare with Nintendo instead of getting shut down or any big public blowup
[2:58:29] invisibleboomer: Sir to be very Nintendo is more worried about MIG switch then palworld
[2:58:39] Wulfgrym: nintendo probably has its own lawfirm LUL

[3:00:24] danoh_64: they're not scared they are just waiting to see how long 2+ million people continue to play
[3:00:29] thecynicalshuffler: Nintendo did put out a tweet saying they were going to investigate. so they are at least looking into it
[3:00:32] spanij: lolz
[3:00:35] ArcaneMaki: "It,s OVER 9000!"
[3:00:38] Molvonos: Ya'll not understanding that Ark is still a thing and still popular.
[3:00:39] falldrgn: Palaworld to Nintendo is what a flys is on a cows ass
[3:00:42] CelestialVoyager: lmao LUL
[3:00:42] Molvonos: Palworld aint going anywhere.
[3:00:57] kimmo_gaming: next 10 episodes, Goku fights Vegeta for the 150th time LOL
[3:01:03] Miguel85NYC: Palworld is going to die off
[3:01:05] ninetysix: mods are illegal?
[3:01:05] Lintgamer: Palworld is safe. They arent doing anything wrong
[3:01:32] squishalan: what about minecraft pokemon
[3:01:49] PhilBerex: PayPal lol
[3:01:50] BlewGamingGroup: when youre using someone elses intellectual property to make a profit .. yea ... its kind of illegal
[3:01:50] squishalan: ok
[3:02:04] realStank: I mean, if you wanna get technical, Pokemon took stuff from Dragonquest as well.

[3:02:11] valianya: I can see Gamefreak deciding to make future Nintendo games with the open world exploration and graphics like Palworld does.  They might do something with base building and decoration.  They will absolutely NOT add guns or slaughtering pokemon or using Pokemon as direct weapons.  That level of violence and death is completely against their vision of Pokemon.
[3:02:20] ninetysix: yeah paywall mods, i thoughts mods in general were illegal
[3:02:52] Heero_Effect: never got how private servers stay up on WoW. thought blizzard usually took them out.
[3:02:59] ArcaneMaki: On a side note, I dropped Palworld for Enshrouded and this game is dope!
[3:03:13] kokochris: @ninetysix mods are not illegal.  Not at all.  Selling mods based on existing IP is illegal however.

[3:04:59] maccaruso: I see youtube ads for private servers all the time
[3:05:01] spiriteddecay: im getting youtube ads for ascension now
[3:05:06] BlewGamingGroup: the only one i really know about is the ascension server
[3:05:15] reggiepowa: they might become more popular if there are no wrath classic servers when cata launches
[3:05:29] d2darkalliance: @towelliee havent you seen wow: ascensiob? they do heavy advertisement about that
[3:05:53] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  do u think we will see after Classic Cata or nah?
[3:05:55] reggiepowa: wrath is very popular on private servers
[3:06:16] BlewGamingGroup: its big on youtube ads

[3:07:40] devildriver1919: not really, they can just keeping adding more raids that were scrapped

[3:08:35] WoW_Person: @towelliee do you know when this SoD is over what happens to our character will they roll over to the new expansion?
[3:08:36] devildriver1919: dire maul raid, hyjal raid, scarlet crusase raid
[3:08:44] ninetysix: but can they make sod permanent and start progression in a other path than TBC ?
[3:08:57] Amarlian: Bring back the original way to get to outlands, through deadmines clipping! @Towelliee
[3:08:58] devildriver1919: they could redo zg raid
[3:09:04] Amarlian: I think it was deadmines or was it caverns of time?
[3:09:08] Kaykerrs: I can heal if you need for stocks towel
[3:09:21] Slitze: this grizzly hills music?
[3:09:45] reggiepowa: FeelsStrongMan grizzly hills
[3:09:52] ninetysix: i hope sod gets a perma server

[3:10:04] Kaykerrs: You should complete your stocks quest super quick lol
[3:10:10] Kaykerrs: just go tag that last convict

[3:11:43] bachooga: bachooga subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months! 
[3:11:48] WoW_Person: not retail that’s obviously understandable, I’m saying will these characters carry over to further expansions that they release for classic
[3:11:54] WoW_Person: SoD^
[3:12:49] im_capy: Seasonal be seasonal
[3:12:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  for tbc?
[3:12:55] Piebringer619: noo
[3:12:59] drisan87: How many more runes are we getting in P2?
[3:12:59] WoW_Person: probably what they will do and I’ll just be done 😂😂😂
[3:13:04] Piebringer619: its already done
[3:13:05] reggiepowa: don't think they will be releasing expansions for classic just new seasons and I doubt characters will carry over
[3:13:25] valianya: They will likely either allow transfers to a vanilla Classic server, or to a potential TBC SOD server (IF they go that route and make it a thing)
[3:13:31] Piebringer619: HARDCORE SoD
[3:13:59] just_kirk_: best way to do that is have someone aggro and jump down. Everyone else loot and run. then do the same for the first guy.
[3:14:11] valianya: If they transfer to a regular vanilla server you won't keep your runes
[3:14:29] Piebringer619: noooo
[3:14:33] Piebringer619: noononono
[3:14:34] im_capy: I think the hype will have worn off by then
[3:14:57] im_capy: agreed
[3:15:14] im_capy: retail for end game, classic for leveling as they say
[3:15:36] Bowwjack: @Towelliee why not though, its a good way to milk a 20 year old game especially since when we get to TBC they can sell the TBC bundle with a mount a pet and a character boost to 60
[3:15:44] Rottencoarse: i read that warriors might get bladestorm for phase 2 that will be nice
[3:15:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  no u need to kill the dude
[3:16:28] im_capy: classic has hardly a cash shop, monthly fee aint enough
[3:17:02] im_capy: We all know how much that first cash shop horse earned them

[3:18:41] Kaykerrs: Runnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
[3:19:57] Kaykerrs: haha congrats
[3:20:06] valianya: It's most likely they will launch a new SOD season with different rune progression paths.  Might get a warrior healer who bandages or shouts at you to come back to life.  Or a Mage tank.  Or a priest that does DPS with pets.  Or something else wild.
[3:20:29] Kaykerrs: yea that's happened to me before, they will just ignore you

[3:25:55] invisibleboomer: sir the only hate that blizzard deserves is season 3 of diablo4

[3:27:01] raldrik: yeah and they super buffed the xp for your robot so it levels quick and actually has good help for leveling
[3:27:03] DrkPhoenix6913: i was getting that same issue this morning, it eventually did come up after like 15 minutes
[3:27:07] Verdell263: I logged in twice this weekend for about an hour total and couldn't keep playing. Boring still
[3:27:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah vaults are better with the 10 per pearl change
[3:27:59] Rottencoarse: season 2 start was awesome imo
[3:28:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: i like to get to tier 4 asap, then take my time
[3:28:05] 07biby: 3 words... P T R
[3:28:16] valianya: In D4 they made the construct level up way faster, the pearls give 10 stacks each, they added another chest to the vaults and apparently the vault spam is fastest way to level now
[3:28:18] GodTheMechanic: First week IS the PTR
[3:28:27] Molvonos: All the 1 month+ people.
[3:28:33] Heero_Effect: @haxzorjimduggan same, WT3 just feels pointless

[6:00:21] GoIdenOnyx: They're crazy, but I love them
[6:00:26] 91Niki: @GoIdenOnyx You think you do but you don't
[6:00:34] pbnj_kills: mine barks in my face at 7 everymorning to wake me up
[6:00:39] boolgogiking: huskys take a lot of work and you need a backyard

[6:01:56] GoIdenOnyx: My plan for a husky is: big fence, stuff under it or bags around it to block off digging, big backyard for running, etc..
[6:02:03] Wulfgrym: @91Niki when they say hi energy, they should have like an S+ tier for huskies LUL
[6:02:16] GoIdenOnyx: You also have to get them used to cats at a young age or they may not like them
[6:02:25] Gungre: Same with Cane Carso

[6:03:54] 91Niki: The thing for me with husky's is, they are stubborn and more like cats than dogs, personality wise. I love their energy, I hate their unwillingness to do stuff. I want a belgian malinois, because they are literally husky's but they want to do work.
[6:03:55] Elijahss: Facts

[7:24:53] misterwinoe: there was at least two first down passes that got dropped
[7:25:14] SevecDK: Towelliee should eat more he is becoming thin
[7:25:24] Howitzer1028: both games had terrible 2nd half’s. now it’s time for the most boring Super Bowl
[7:25:30] Prevention6: crazy 2nd half comebacks always fun to watch
[7:25:30] KShellZx: the run call on 2nd and goal was brutal at the end,had to waste a timeout
[7:25:34] force_FMD: why taunt over the player also like wtf
[7:25:41] Submarine_Mike: coach is a gambler

[7:29:21] Molvonos: I mean, in ten years you're gonna have peoples grandkids watching you @Towelliee towSip
[7:29:26] kingdaddy96: For sure. It was the confidence. They ran a great play. The QB hit the perfect throw. The receiver couldn't catch it. Was Al about confidence. They started to get in their own heads and the mountain just kept growing
[7:29:28] xmedpakx: taking the 3 points making it a 1 score game was an obvious choice imo but w/e
[7:29:44] Lishipeachi: it depends on how the relationship ended. if you parted on good terms she might be trying to give you a heads up so you dont get blindsided hearing it elsewhere
[7:29:48] Heero_Effect: true
[7:30:39] LimpyMcGee1: he was the most aggressive all year for playcalling
[7:30:47] SevecDK: Towelliee will be thin as a stick in 3 years he lost so much fat
[7:30:51] Quojin: Tell your ex she'd get a toy by eating a McDs kids meal lol
[7:30:52] drewetling: towLets towGo
[7:30:56] LimpyMcGee1: it got him there and he stood by it
[7:30:56] Wulfgrym: the first time i can understand going for it, but in teh 2nd half 100% take the 3 points
[7:31:19] harris243124: duckShake duckShake duckShake duckShake
[7:31:36] CDubTheRIPper: Prayge
[7:31:36] ryano23: Yeah I'd probs go FG, but they have been aggressive af all year and it has worked a majority of the time. Tough stuff
[7:31:41] Wulfgrym: @Heero_Effect you should of responded, who are you again?
[7:31:48] TheGiant99: Lamar didn't look like a MVP yesterday
[7:31:55] xmedpakx: no offense to any chiefs fans but kinda bored of them , i had hoped baltimore/lions, i dont mind the niners though
[7:32:07] Heero_Effect: @lishipeachi yeah…that’s what she said….that whole breakup fucking killed me
[7:32:33] Wulfgrym: @TheGiant99 i kept repeating all 9ers game, so Lamar is the MVP. Lamar can have his regular season reward while the real QBs go to the SB

[7:39:45] MortalLesuj: stockade
[7:39:54] BlewGamingGroup: i wouldnt put it past blizz to let us go in blind
[7:39:55] TheEyeVII: I mean she said who she is NFL>COD>Blizzard? idk makes no sense to me
[7:40:45] BlewGamingGroup: you go in blind and no one is going to know what the flavor of the month is going to be and people level what they like to play
[7:40:59] Wulfgrym: makes sense to me need a manager who can handle the boardroom
[7:40:59] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[7:41:16] Verdell263: towWho
[7:41:59] Shugaze: these are creative people too not managment
[7:42:07] TheEyeVII: literally anyone at blizzard with more than 1 year of exp someone who remotely knows the IPs even one, her first and only comment about blizzard games is "Big D4 Fan" idk.. w/e
[7:42:13] Arocian: $
[7:42:14] Wulfgrym: you're more manager than game developer running the business side of the company
[7:42:49] tr4ncetv: yeah what, no leadership position is going to be focused on the product, their performance is based on profit
[7:42:55] restokin: Ion actually wouldn't have been a bad choice - it tends to be lawyers or accountants that end up in the C-suite, and he's a lawyer
[7:42:57] Arocian: big D4 fan
[7:43:14] Arocian: lol
[7:43:15] BlewGamingGroup: ghostcrawler for president .... lmao
[7:43:24] Arocian: valid
[7:43:26] Alaquane: she's here to sell you more mounts
[7:43:39] Heero_Effect: they probably won’t impact games unless something bad happens sales wise
[7:43:52] Arocian: absolutely, just keep Blizzard moving forward
[7:44:05] restokin: No point judging now. Deserves a chance. Let's talk after Blizzcon
[7:44:11] MackPlays: The president has 0 effect on the game, they manage people not the game
[7:44:15] SevecDK: arent you worried blizzard will create too many WoW with Hardcore then Wrath Classic then Season of Discovery?
[7:44:49] CDubTheRIPper: NODDERS
[7:44:53] Hyelander_: @SevecDK oh no, more veriety
[7:44:55] Wulfgrym: well someone can pay microsoft like 100 billion for blizzard and they can pick the president LUL
[7:45:12] Irahh: I've pretty much stopped playing retail right now haha

[7:45:55] valianya: Idk she's coming from COD and NFL, she's got control of deciding how to monetize, and she might push more predatory monetization onto Blizzard games
[7:45:59] TheEyeVII: thoughts about aotc mounts being on the trading-post? @Towelliee
[7:46:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they fix the game lol

[7:46:29] Yaeger54: I got top many games to play. Playing granblue fantasy relink
[7:46:47] tr4ncetv: @valianya she's not the sole decision maker on this, but yeah, can definitely happen. Capitalism!
[7:47:02] Sicknessqt: its live service with seasonal updates
[7:47:34] MoonwalkingAngel: its a third person shooter open world game
[7:47:45] valianya: Aotc mounts aren't on trading post though?  Why discuss that?
[7:47:45] anxietyrising: Think more the avengers game
[7:47:53] Pups_Gersky: I'm not downing the game before it is live, but it feels like it lacks an identity, from what I've seen. Maybe it will have more on what all it is about.
[7:48:19] valianya: I think there's a scaling endgame looter shooter missions
