[0:14:35] sixpumps: the 40 rogue kit is unmatched
[0:14:40] An7ido7e: Yep. SP is going to counter pretty hard at 40 I think
[0:14:57] Zemnis: do you have to use the same spec/runes the whole time? i mean we arent sure right?
[0:15:04] murloc_oracle: you can switch runes on the fly cant you?
[0:15:09] darmashx: mages look insane with the instant pyroblast or frostfire bolt
[0:15:12] Landon_MDL: can any class win rogue at 40?

[0:17:05] Landon_MDL: 40 is rogue's bracket man even if they dont get a single rune
[0:17:05] Zemnis: ya rogue is going to be shitting on everyone 1v1 imo
[0:17:05] An7ido7e: Correct. @snutzy After patch tomorrow, we should know a bit better whats going on.
[0:17:09] Zemnis: meta lock spooky tho
[0:17:15] veiloflonelystars: thats the cool thing of the tournament timing, people won't be able to test it all and see whats best so people just go with what they want
[0:17:15] An7ido7e: @snutzy Likely later this week the new datamined info should populate

[0:45:52] fafoo204: are u sticking it out w/ lock?
[0:45:54] JonnySweatpants: have war / hunter at 25, workin on rogue pries
[0:45:54] djbawz_: where destros spells all scale with level
[0:45:57] Dirtyharry128: What 40 talents pvp will be best for lock ?
[0:46:03] brydorn: it’s a little weird whatever is good is who has better training
[0:46:03] vepsee: I feel 40 bracket eles too good/fun to pass up
[0:46:05] dominozxx: like if they nerf master chan then destro gonna have to make its way in with succubus
[0:46:28] cmf_westers: I feel like it has to be SP if they get disperse or ps
[0:46:33] Choopaloop: Did you already go to vegas for your work trip or is that coming up
[0:46:45] wowlegit: my only hope is that felguard is op and we go demo SL felguard build. like bm hunter on steroid
[0:46:47] Gunnan22: They get one or the other
[0:47:01] Choopaloop: Nice! How was that?
[0:47:06] cmf_westers: fully stacked shadow talents with mind spike and disperse is gonna be really hard to beat for any class
[0:47:09] vepsee: rogue muti build might crank in pvp
[0:47:12] vepsee: with the 40 energy change
[0:47:14] bazzzzzzz: Thoughts on hunter PET... 60% movement speed for 15sec, on 30sec CD.. Into 50% increased damage enrage giving CC immunity. Isn't the pet gonna run down anyone?
[0:47:16] fafoo204: i bet muti cranks yea
[0:47:21] TierXtreme: druid gonna sleep classes on opener...watch
[0:47:41] JonnySweatpants: part of me just wants to level everything
[0:47:44] dominozxx: imagine if we get UA and its instant cast.. omg
[0:47:45] cmf_westers: thing is, you can still play penance as SP, so I feel like you could deal with UA even
[0:47:53] cmf_westers: they're nerfing penance and pom though I guess
[0:47:54] cmf_westers: but still
[0:48:12] djbawz_: we can get rank6
[0:48:14] JonnySweatpants: i might do priest first honestly
[0:48:25] cmf_westers: true I gues
[0:48:53] cmf_westers: I feel like feral is a real contender
[0:48:55] cmf_westers: yea
[0:49:11] bazzzzzzz: hunter beats everyone
[0:49:14] bazzzzzzz: gotta
[0:49:15] MachoGG: play spriest and just swap beteween pain supp and disperse
[0:49:17] TierXtreme: feral and boomy
[0:49:17] cmf_westers: and potentially rogue, but I feel like they would get shafted by sp
[0:49:20] TierXtreme: both gonna sleep people
[0:49:20] vepsee: they're gonna have so much burst now with zerk and new tigers fury
[0:49:27] djbawz_: yeah i think unless your a class that can delete the hunter pet u lose
[0:49:29] primecloth: magic dust and tidal charm gonna be lock best friend for tournament
[0:49:40] dominozxx: its gonna be tricky world pvp like having felpup for casters vs void sac vs like ferals/rogues
[0:49:47] bazzzzzzz: !otk
[0:49:47] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740

[1:12:20] smansur: @snutzy they made a big mistake with what? it cut off
[1:12:51] PastryDeath: stream snipers?
[1:13:04] fanniclap: @smansur big mistake with how long P1 is
[1:13:06] Em_cee__: facts
[1:13:12] smansur: agree
[1:13:17] PastryDeath: agree
[1:13:24] josephromeolouis: Snutz I used to watch you growing up mad respect
[1:13:25] PastryDeath: it should have been a month tops
[1:13:30] cmf_westers: p2 should've been around new years
[1:13:31] smansur: phase 1 should have been 4 weeks
[1:13:36] Treped: So 10 weeks too long for P1?
[1:13:45] cmf_westers: maybe even slightly before so everyone had time off to play
[1:13:47] vepsee: it shouldve been out like 2-3 weeks ago
[1:14:00] TinyTimtations: this amount of time has been good for p1  Not all of us can play all the time
[1:14:08] saintfrancis: !otk
[1:14:08] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740
[1:14:31] cmf_westers: I think it's not only stretching it out, but I think it's got to do with other blizzard game releases
[1:14:38] cmf_westers: diablo seasons, retail sesaons
[1:14:40] TinyTimtations: but you need 3 months to get bis
[1:14:56] xblackmothx: you don't need bis either lol you're moving on to 40
[1:15:00] 86Danger: im a dad with a job.. took 4 dasys to hit max xD
[1:15:03] ThaHoInU: has there been a phase 1 tourny already?
[1:15:11] fanniclap: @TinyTimtations idts IMO. I have a son, work full time and only play a few hours off and on and Im pretty stuck with nothing to do
[1:15:17] PastryDeath: I have 10 level 25s and I got so bored waiting for new phase that I let my sub expire
[1:15:19] Dklosterhoff: Maybe they change for P2
[1:15:24] fanniclap: @TinyTimtations But i know what you mean
[1:15:32] d1rtysl0th: I rekon production was delayed 2-3 weeks for a lot of tweaking of P2 pvp / runes / items after P1 feedback hey
[1:15:36] Gunnan22: Its not about needing or not it was to enjoy the time at 25.  It was a whole new experience
[1:15:36] artarvio: but then a smaller percentage get to experience all the facets of the phase
[1:15:44] Em_cee__: is it a no rules tourney KEKW
[1:15:47] vepsee: what sucks is they have a roadmap for this shit
[1:15:48] artarvio: i think only streamers had a problem with the length of the phase
[1:15:49] vepsee: so buckle up
[1:15:49] Em_cee__: or limited rather
[1:15:52] vepsee: and enjoy the 2-3 months per phase
[1:15:58] Em_cee__: LUL
[1:15:58] chingaway: honestly capping levels doesnt make sense to me
[1:16:02] mox2g: 3 months is a joke
[1:16:09] fanniclap: @artarvio if you ask in general I bet youll see otherwise
[1:16:19] vepsee: I think the 3 day lockout really burned alot of people out
[1:16:21] Em_cee__: most of my people are off it already
[1:16:26] Em_cee__: and thats because it was too long
[1:16:28] xblackmothx: @chingaway well for one it gives them the opportunity to fine tune all the new things they've added.
[1:16:38] mox2g: waiting this long made me lose the hype
[1:16:42] PastryDeath: 3 months is fine at level 60 because there are like 18 raids to farm. When you have only 1 raid on a 3 day lockout it just makes people raid log for a month
[1:16:43] OGSceneBoy: How was your LA trip man?
[1:16:47] artarvio: i can see it both ways but i am glad it was edged on the side of longer rather than rushed
[1:16:50] djbawz_: it was nice to take a break over christmas and new year having missed nothing
[1:16:54] vepsee: artificially prolonging game time
[1:17:02] dagger0k: what u think about demonic embrace tallent?
[1:17:19] Em_cee__: i think the 40 bracket is crucial if 40 bracket gets dusty then there are way too many games coming
[1:17:27] fanniclap: I know a bunch of ppl who didnt even play P1 and just waiting for p2 so they didnt hit the down time
[1:17:32] kilograms420: kilograms420 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! bis streams
[1:17:33] TinyTimtations: I think its been fun as and now feels like a good time to move on.
[1:17:39] OGSceneBoy: They are doing it to inflate sub numbers for sure
[1:17:41] phlapjak: if they do later phases as well as p2 seems they can take as long as they want
[1:18:03] vepsee: Im def stoked for 60, hopefully entirely new content and not just rehashed old dungeons, which are still cool
[1:18:18] PastryDeath: I think the momentum will die in phase 2 because 100% of the bis gear is PVP or Gnomer and people will already have WSG rep done so it will just be AB grind and raid logging
[1:18:18] Dirtyharry128: What spec do you plan to go pvp 40 lock
[1:18:22] spoxan: !otk
[1:18:22] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740
[1:18:32] Xiunitv: @phlapjak how do you even know pt 2 is good yet
[1:18:40] xblackmothx: It's also a no PTR experience so stopping at certain phases helps them fine tune / fix things that might not have been intended or got overlooked.
[1:18:40] fanniclap: Gonna lurk for a bit eat some food but hopefully i'll catch you before you end stream
[1:18:48] fanniclap: good to see you big dawg
[1:19:03] PastryDeath: They made a huge mistake by putting all the new itemization in the raids. They should have put rare drops in dungeons
[1:19:13] Em_cee__: LUL

[1:32:24] Itshighnoonwotlk: thats 80% of wow
[1:32:27] vepsee: why dont they just make it so you cant trade gold inside instances and loot becomes bop if you leave said instance, unless thats impossible to code
[1:32:28] vepsee: doubt it
[1:32:37] inspect4: @itshighnoonwotlk 80% Kappa
[1:32:52] Simmshady: gdkp ban is bad for activity
[1:32:53] Em_cee__: nothing is impossible its just wether or not they would spend the time
[1:32:55] command0mil0: @vepsee but what about outside instance?
[1:32:55] vepsee: it wouldnt solve much aside from the straight up gold trading

[1:33:34] vepsee: im not sure, just spit ballin
[1:33:38] zomnipotent: they literally wont hire 5 people to GM the game and ban bots
[1:33:41] gormzo: if there are gdkp there's gonna be gold buying

[1:35:09] vepsee: I think at least 150-200 gold after mount cost is a good start
[1:35:15] TierXtreme: never bought gold..play era..but GDKP allowed me to earn..and just get on par with other people with gear..now I'm on of the top healers on server..not cuz of skill jus simply gear..Chain heal is not a skill ability lol

[1:42:07] Slesky: @snutzy WoW downloads a program on your PC that sits idle. It's called Warden. Once Blizz suspect you run GDKP or you've been reported they activate Warden on your PC and monitor your external processes...very sketchy shit
[1:42:13] acidagger: snutz has to decide if he wants 20k
[1:42:25] OGSceneBoy: Fansly? lol
[1:42:28] Landon_MDL: aren't you gonna search for the lock runes?

[1:43:02] pengwin06: what I like about gdkp is everyone has a real chance at gear. i would never have gotten gressil in my loot council.

[1:49:01] LaughMET: Will Meta warlock be better with soul link for tanking the melees?
[1:49:15] chally1: favorite wow memory? first couple that come to your mind
[1:49:27] vepsee: step on rogue is gonna be so fucking massive Kreygasm

[1:49:51] vepsee: yessir
[1:49:58] mollymangomoog: shadow gonna be so good i think
[1:50:16] mollymangomoog: shadow mastery locks gonna be disgusting i think so
[1:50:20] Landon_MDL: datamined
[1:50:33] varatupaj: maybe 38 drain life with master channeler will be good enough
[1:50:38] Landon_MDL: wait did blizzard posted official runes?
[1:50:42] Landon_MDL: i didnt saw that so idk
[1:50:44] vepsee: blue post was I think master of shadows and shuriken toss
[1:50:50] acidagger: I wonder what version of shs its gonna be the tbc one where u can step in root or
[1:50:53] varatupaj: beacuase its usually when it becomes good without rune
[1:51:11] vepsee: they said in the interview today every class is getting 6-7 runes
[1:51:20] acidagger: ye bro was so busted
[1:51:25] TierXtreme: blizz literally said NOT ALL DATAMINED WILL BE IN GAME..so they prob would have been but now they are giving the middle finger lol
[1:51:34] vepsee: we just dont know if the datamined ones are the ones were getting now or not
[1:51:43] vepsee: could be some new ones no ones seen yet
[1:51:52] mollymangomoog: i feel like locks can just heal lot through damage and next phase it will just be more no?
[1:52:01] Crawf6: will be all the bracerv]
[1:52:06] Itshighnoonwotlk: its all a lie bois, we aint getting shit
[1:52:08] Crawf6: belt/boots runes*
[1:52:22] vepsee: @Itshighnoonwotlk big prank, they keep us at 25 and force us to twink
[1:52:27] vepsee: its a wow fun server
[1:52:34] Landon_MDL: i have 700 gold ill go full consums this phase and then quit wow after 1 month
[1:52:43] vepsee: I heard stv event gives AB rep
[1:52:53] vepsee: so prob easy like ashenvale up to revered at least
[1:53:04] Landon_MDL: man ive seen dudes going exalted in wsg in one session of 18 hours
[1:53:17] mollymangomoog: i think its going to be so absurd its already so broken rn
[1:53:27] Andrettiixd: Rep from revered to exalted is such a slog
[1:53:41] Itshighnoonwotlk: @vepsee makes sense, p2 launch and we get 0 xp and not a single rune. classic blizz
[1:53:42] ratpunisher: level 38 drain rank is pretty powerful
[1:53:51] ratpunisher: at least historicallt
[1:54:15] TheLonelyMoose: !otk
[1:54:15] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740
[1:54:20] Kaldakwow: I think spriest wins the tourny
[1:54:23] vepsee: runes would be like swapping gear no?
[1:54:26] vepsee: think thats fine
[1:54:31] isharpsword: can you show gear for a sec
[1:55:02] isharpsword: thanks man
[1:55:06] Kaldakwow: Hear me out
[1:55:08] mollymangomoog: ua would be so crazy
[1:55:09] Kaldakwow: Boomy might actually contend
[1:55:12] mollymangomoog: you think youd rock felguard?
[1:55:23] Itshighnoonwotlk: will stv event give free bg revered to the forum complainers as well?
[1:55:30] mollymangomoog: it would def be phase 3 i think
[1:55:43] stormyweatherr: ngl the lock runes look hella boring for p2
[1:55:43] varatupaj: what felguard even does?
[1:55:53] vepsee: helm/bracers are def p3, alot of the datamined runes for those had abilities we cant get at 40
[1:55:57] mollymangomoog: i think more classes will just be catching up to locks next phase more than anything though
[1:56:06] mollymangomoog: pvp wise at least
[1:56:24] mollymangomoog: besides priests they just get more disgusting lol
[1:56:43] khourdrick: Immolation Aura might be a rune at 40 could gonna be a great rune against every class
[1:56:50] cokexdxd: hunter gonna be the weakest class next patch im calling it
[1:57:13] vepsee: every class seems like they have great potential
[1:57:16] vepsee: im excited
[1:57:30] vepsee: 1 pm pst
[1:57:31] stormyweatherr: ranged frost trap in wpvp will be disgusting
[1:57:34] vepsee: 8th
[1:57:40] cokexdxd: yeah theyre pushing melee hunter way too hard ranged hunter gonna be terrible
[1:57:40] Treped: Im still wondering what class to lvl first?
[1:57:56] gmar_07: are they releasing the xp buff before or nah
[1:58:08] tipsoutbaby: aint no way ur getting an invite dog
[1:58:08] timbo_slice_88: @snutzy do you know if you can still farm wsg badges on Wednesday and they will be in mailbox for release still?
[1:58:11] Itshighnoonwotlk: lvl priest or sham if u wanna fuck shit up
[1:58:13] spacecowboyr: @cokexdxd lol no it won't. it'll still be good in pvp. melee is just gonna break PvE
[1:58:17] vepsee: @gmar_07 pre sure they said when p2 launches
[1:58:20] spacecowboyr: if that lone wolf 30% buff is true
[1:58:25] tipsoutbaby: oh sick

[2:00:23] Zeroflex1: I have one stinky purple parse left on aquanis because they refuse to do the parse strat but otherwise all orange and pink parses
[2:00:26] Tebblix: whats looking juiced at 40
[2:00:28] Skeetin_: people will pre stack quests get 40 in 20 minutes then cry theres nothing to do
[2:00:30] ChillyHTX: yeah mage / priest for sod

[2:01:33] Zeroflex1: purge for healing classes
[2:01:45] TierXtreme: boomy
[2:01:51] dj_efx: yea pushback is a bitch for ele
[2:01:59] Zeroflex1: rogue for sure, but idk I think they jump blast hunters out of the sky next phase
[2:01:59] dj_efx: the instant meatballs will be nice tho
[2:02:01] dominozxx: eles will be kings in bgs
[2:02:02] dj_efx: if its real
[2:02:04] Zeroflex1: crazy fast lightning bolts
[2:02:09] Zeroflex1: instant lava burst procs
[2:02:16] vepsee: spriest getting shadowfiend and dispersion next phase presumably, never go oom
[2:02:17] dj_efx: in the open world, i cant get a lavaburst off lol
[2:02:17] vepsee: in a 1v1
[2:02:19] vepsee: KEKW
[2:02:23] stormyweatherr: the melee grounding totem thing that is also freedom looks crazy (if it's even real)
[2:02:32] khourdrick: Eye of the storm talent stops pushback in their talents
[2:02:36] Tebblix: My warlock so geared at 25 i dont wanna level him to 40 hahaha
[2:02:51] ballersoup: what are u leveling first? @snutzy
[2:02:52] dj_efx: ele def gonna be needed in every single group. allys gonna cry

[2:03:31] Treped: Stv event gonna be crazy with the free for all aspect
[2:03:34] j_mar13: lock runes dont look great next phase unforuantely
[2:03:43] mello_yollo: ya grouping doesnt help in stv from what they say
[2:03:44] sirbangsalot_: thoughts on Shadow Priest pvp 1v1 & 10/10 + 15/15
[2:03:52] vepsee: @ballersoup ele's like one of the only specs that can truly 1 tap people lmfao
[2:03:59] vepsee: its a scary spec in pvp
[2:04:07] ballersoup: yea at 40 it will be so fucking fun lol
[2:04:08] Itshighnoonwotlk: give sham storm, earth and fire rune for 5sec earthbind root, that would spice things up
[2:04:10] mollymangomoog: i think locks will just be afraid of spriests and boomy probs next phase
[2:04:11] TierXtreme: I think boomy and spriest will be the winners
[2:04:12] Kaldakwow: I think boomy will be scary with starfire eclips damage followed by a starsurge
[2:04:20] sirbangsalot_: hell yuh. i'm over playing heal bitch for now
[2:04:21] stingxz: did you get exalted with wsg?
[2:04:27] moistspeedo: new warlock runes are so snore
[2:04:42] TierXtreme: all you have to do to beat a lock is range them..its not hard
[2:04:51] ChillyHTX: oof
[2:04:52] khourdrick: Resto shamans are low key underrated at 40. Having to use ancestral knowledge and ns seems broken
[2:04:55] inspect4: Sidnt starsurge get nerfed pretty heavily
[2:05:01] gormzo: do you really tho ?
[2:05:01] inspect4: didnt
[2:05:01] sirbangsalot_: how long u have until then? 1k easy a week turnin
