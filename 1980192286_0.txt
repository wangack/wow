[2:27:42] Kitkitten_: cobaltWiz weirdp4Flying yum
[2:27:43] xEUNx: there are cold spots roughly every 4 cm
[2:27:53] frozenbread_: What was the size of the fly?
[2:27:58] DarkMeos: also if the fly sat in a corner it would most likely be unaffected, since the waves are concentrated
[2:28:02] Dogebert: Did you still eat the fly pizza
[2:28:03] Camelsock: there were probably dozens of eggs on that thing
[2:28:14] RandomDanny: its probably not as small now
[2:28:15] CharlieC97: Depeding of the size of the fly it is immune to microwaves, the same way humans are immune to radio waves because of our size
[2:28:17] Kitkitten_: Maybe it's a super fly now
[2:28:19] aandrewjeski: expected it to be a LADYBUG
[2:28:21] Clayton2k9: If you microwave a bumble bee long enough it will pop
[2:28:25] JohnnysHappyHideout: GIGACHAD GIGAFLY casually tanking
[2:28:26] Kitkitten_: going to be the next Marvel character
[2:28:27] zsocw: Non-ionizing just means it won't like, alter their fucking DNA. It doesn't mean they won't fry lol. But yeah if it's small, 2.4ghz microwaves could just miss it.
