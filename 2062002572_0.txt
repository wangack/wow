[0:53:36] vepsee: YOU GOTTA GET THE POSI MENTAL BACK BRO
[0:53:42] CAD604: ^
[0:53:45] vepsee: playing war is ruining everything

[0:53:51] novvum: @SwagMacDaddy69 Eh they destroying Warriors and its not fun for Warriors. They buff classes that are op in P1... doesnt make sense

[0:55:26] ObrezKnight: trying to find a 2h sword guide...
[0:55:26] novvum: I made a rogue and hunt
[0:55:26] bronchoped1: Switched to ele shaman. Warrior feels dogshit in all facets of game
[0:55:26] tyresemicah: I feel bad need to be able to survive is all
[0:55:28] Fuskigare: fury seems better :P
[0:55:31] CwoodAGG21: leveled my warrior first, now leveling my priest
[0:55:33] miloxz: i was a warrior main
[0:55:34] DrLegend305: weathering the storm until phase 3
[0:55:35] KrazyStep: i think we arent 60 and if u dont play with a healer in Classic in general is a bad idea
[0:55:38] iPlayCuzFun: im having hella fun main tanking as warr tho, 4.6k armor and 2.7k hp unbuffedd
[0:55:38] Fuskigare: more dmg
[0:55:40] spicydeluxe_: my husband ended up  rerollin going mage
[0:55:40] theWoyer: I've mained warrior all of SoD and I just recently started leveling a paladin, loving it so far. There are way more fun and interesting runes than what warrior currently offers.
[0:55:40] xfacedx: Just wait dude they'll buff warriors
[0:55:42] Korvynah: honestly as a rogue and mage main im having a blast
[0:55:43] nyanpuppi: arms is 100% better
[0:55:44] mitchp333: grinding till I’m done with it
[0:55:47] don_kneee: ahlaundoh was cracking yesterday
[0:55:52] ObrezKnight: improved intercept
[0:55:52] NoodlePersonagain: i just play hunter for melee weave
[0:55:53] notoriousz: fury is not better in pve
[0:55:56] spicydeluxe_: but I main rouge always
[0:55:56] trilligami17: it doesnt feel bad to me as a new warrior in sod tbh, in pve u gotta go 2h because the armor values of bosses are way too high. i 2 shot in pvp also
[0:55:58] Fuskigare: even pvp more dmg
[0:55:59] diirtybum: part of me feels like warrior at 60 will be awesome
[0:56:00] jaygutta504: try 2h enchance shaman
[0:56:00] dumpringz: armour values too high, arms t least has some bleed
[0:56:03] don_kneee: nah
[0:56:04] bronchoped1: Paladin is just as bad LUL
[0:56:05] notoriousz: arms is absolutely better atm in pve
[0:56:07] dumpringz: fury has nought
[0:56:08] SmokeManMuscle: SmokeManMuscle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:56:08] ryl24: nah
[0:56:12] caudie1: lvl an enhancement shaman and hope phase 3 is better for warrior
[0:56:12] don_kneee: arm
[0:56:15] NawtyTyme: furry pares the hightest in sims
[0:56:15] bisonzx10r: Unironically this is a hybrids game now. They were relegated to healing and pretty much treated like a pariah if they didnt want to. I think if you want a healbot to follow you around you need to premade, or accept that hybrids dont have to heal anymore to play the game
[0:56:17] iPlayCuzFun: warr tank bis tank tho
[0:56:23] BIEM491: Playing hunter to feel good as a warrior
[0:56:24] don_kneee: he was arms
[0:56:29] bronchoped1: Savix is waiting for s3 for pally too. Just like you are warrior
[0:56:51] spicydeluxe_: their personalities
[0:56:52] dumpringz: ret gets slammed by armour values too
[0:56:55] JihnFei: bottom barrel dps
[0:56:56] roflpotamus: they suck too lmao
[0:56:57] jared1991z: bro... they r gonna fkn hot fix it lol its liek week 2 at 40...
[0:56:58] mitchp333: they kinda suck tbh
[0:56:58] iLtDan: pally op
[0:57:02] myodoctor: blizzard locked one of its wheelchair brakes
[0:57:03] Korvynah: paladins are just magical warriors lets be real
[0:57:04] eebuK: pally is warr w/heals lol
[0:57:07] bronchoped1: Ret is shit too. You put them in bubble instantly
[0:57:09] Korvynah: D:
[0:57:09] ChuudotGaming: how about shockadin
[0:57:17] nowheretoday: I think all melee not doing well
[0:57:29] jellymann: do you find hunter or priest more 'fun'?
[0:57:30] roflpotamus: dont you like to parse in the raid? xD
[0:57:32] dumpringz: paladins can only beat warriors in pvp apparently haha
[0:57:34] jared1991z: yes.... it will get tuned....
[0:57:40] azzy_dog: Numbers change, abilities don't
[0:57:46] notoriousz: but warriors should ways be top of the meter
[0:57:47] spicydeluxe_: tell the shamans that
[0:57:48] bronchoped1: Enhance bottom in p1, bottom in p2
[0:57:50] itbeHootie: omg melee not doing the most damage for a week.. didn't see any complaints p1 LUL
[0:57:54] Korvynah: imagine if power creep goes unchecked phase 3 and the health pool goes up 20% and the damage goes up another 200%
[0:58:09] KairuruTV: biggest thing to focus on in early phases is playstyle
[0:58:10] roflpotamus: warriors w gear are going to be scary, per usual
[0:58:14] wreck561: wtf ele pumps
[0:58:17] Connnorr: ww axe or bloodmoon mace
[0:58:22] Korvynah: ele shamans are def not struggling lmfao
[0:58:26] bronchoped1: Enhance is the weakest spec in game. Ele is gg and resto is solid
[0:58:28] bisonzx10r: @dumpringz the HoJ stun combo with all their upfront damage melts just about anything that isnt a druid in bear form lmao
[0:58:29] Slandii: you raiding today mate?
[0:58:31] the_snarf: it was a lock
[0:58:31] Korvynah: shaman tank is insane too
[0:58:35] benis____cannon: ele is sick
[0:58:35] wreck561: i wish i wouldve leveled my shaman over my war lol
[0:58:35] NawtyTyme: thats swamp
[0:58:36] vepsee: people are complaining about different shit, some are talking pvp, some are talking pve
[0:58:39] vepsee: everyones all over the place
[0:58:40] bronchoped1: Enhance dps that is
[0:58:49] spicydeluxe_: @vepsee that’s true
[0:59:07] twitterlesstyler: @sonii Would you be open to the idea of Blizzard adding a class like DK into the classic environment in further phases of SoD?
[0:59:09] Korvynah: to be fair there is a lot of complaining right now but warriors have a valid argument
[0:59:28] iPlayCuzFun: hell yeah warrior main tank fun af, i have 4.6k armor and 2.7k hp fully unbuffed and the healers are chilling
[0:59:31] jellymann: quick chat, am i rolling a hunter or priest? stuck between the two
[0:59:38] thegoobay: boomiers
[0:59:39] don_kneee: boomies now lmao
[0:59:40] xfacedx: Ice Lance sucks
[0:59:40] thegoobay: boomies
[0:59:41] don_kneee: ROFL
[0:59:44] iLtDan: boomkin is ass now
[0:59:46] valkryn21: just wait for gear lol
[0:59:48] Korvynah: boomies bc they cant AP POM PYRO every 6 seconds
[0:59:50] don_kneee: dude
[0:59:50] bronchoped1: Boonies acting like the world ended
[0:59:52] KairuruTV: the only thing we need to agree on right now is spriest is op
[0:59:53] Andriukiukas1: Mages go oom fast
[0:59:53] azzy_dog: They are mad mad
[0:59:57] thegoobay: reee my starsurge doesnt hit for 1.6k anymore :(
[0:59:58] IrisFromAlaska: fuck boomies
[0:59:58] don_kneee: so much tear
[0:59:59] jared1991z: im a boomie im pissed
[1:00:05] jared1991z: 1.5k surges were 2 op
[1:00:06] Chaboi_Twill: i want aoe on feral.. gimme swipe w/ ap scale
[1:00:08] NoodlePersonagain: no one wants to play melee huhter
[1:00:10] Viccili: we dont have our poushback immune yet so hardcasting is booty
[1:00:12] don_kneee: TRUEEEEEEE
[1:00:22] bronchoped1: Boomies legitimately the most annoying players in sod
[1:00:23] iLtDan: boomie has always been bad tho
[1:00:34] thegoobay: I did tell you to Spriest at 40 last week xD
[1:00:45] foldp: is blood surge not fun to use? does it not add another element to element to the rotation?
[1:00:46] ed1ra: the boomies are in an echo chamber right now about their class being bad
[1:00:47] Korvynah: ya right anyone remember MOP  Panzerkins
[1:00:48] itbeHootie: Boomies are still good, they just dont 1 shot anymore
[1:00:50] shredder1111: i was lvling a warrior but thx to u i can not waste time and level an ele instead
[1:00:51] 0xLisko: played a warrior all p1, starsurge needed a nerf just not 50%
[1:00:51] Korvynah: they have not always been bad
[1:00:57] SpennnyS: they are decent now but they have been non existent for a decade
[1:01:04] azzy_dog: Honestly yes
[1:01:06] iLtDan: yes
[1:01:07] don_kneee: nah they afk
[1:01:08] bronchoped1: Warriors are fine Soni
[1:01:10] bisonzx10r: not at all, its completely valid
[1:01:12] Artiriouz: @Korvynah in classic they have always been bad
[1:01:12] spicydeluxe_: makes sense to me
[1:01:13] grumpsta935: got my warrior to 40, his a bank alt now. I rerolled LUL
[1:01:14] peacebug03: get fucked warriors
[1:01:14] IrisFromAlaska: they just forgot about warriors at all
[1:01:14] vepsee: warriors were the only  complete class lets be real
[1:01:16] azzy_dog: I get wanting to make everyone OP but they really did drop the ball with warrior
[1:01:16] jschroe3: the warrior qq in phase 2 is totally valid
[1:01:18] DrLegend305: kinda fair honestly
[1:01:21] Ragemax_TV: I'm warrior main, and it's pretty sad
[1:01:24] spicydeluxe_: warriors dominated classic
[1:01:24] don_kneee: the cs is terrible too with the automation and copy pasta
[1:01:28] Korvynah: to be fair, blizzard openly said there will be no long term flavor of the month
[1:01:31] Korvynah: look at shadow priest phase 1
[1:01:32] bronchoped1: As soon as Aggrend said warriors are fine that was the dead giveaway
[1:01:33] KhanoTV: I am. I was in shock P1 how little they did to warrior game play to make it more fun
[1:01:34] Korvynah: now look at phase 2
[1:01:34] nowheretoday: Unprofessional? They made a meme of it at blizzcon
[1:01:34] myodoctor: they shoulda just have fun runes. like you can teleport to stormwind bathroom
[1:01:34] Ronmexico9: !thoughts on warrior
[1:01:34] Nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/AgitatedCrowdedBeaverOhMyDog-q-US1AJOuepnvlbV
[1:01:35] bisonzx10r: because they're gods at 60 and relegate everyone else to trash tier
[1:01:35] babyjay1313: I have fun on my warrior once i figured out a rotation, arms is hella fun for lvling
[1:01:38] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:01:41] vepsee: Adge
[1:01:41] azzy_dog: I wanted to alt a warrior but watching how everyone else got cool shit I decided against it
[1:01:48] SamDavidsin: the meters
[1:01:49] don_kneee: LOL
[1:01:51] ObrezKnight: parsing andys thing pve matters
[1:01:53] DrLegend305: idk it's just nice to not see so many warriors running around
[1:01:53] Snowkatana: from p1+
[1:01:55] jschroe3: i watched you barely kill two 38 normal mobs yesterday as warrior in the world lol
[1:01:55] don_kneee: yeah idk people lost man
[1:01:58] ohkay710: i think people just need to wait until 60 and realize lvl 40 isnt end game and its gonna suck atm just like it sucked for spriests in ph1 >.>
[1:02:00] jschroe3: warriors need something
[1:02:01] KairuruTV: i think they are mainly adding abilities from other xpaks, and feel like they have added good stuff to warrior, but it just doesnt work well in this phase
[1:02:04] trevsee: What would you change for warriors?
[1:02:05] spicydeluxe_: gear prio, best tanks, all my tanks got scarab lord, etc
[1:02:06] don_kneee: RAID LOG GODS
[1:02:06] shredder1111: they should strive to make all classes good, not make one dogshit as punishment for being good 20 years ago

[1:02:20] wreck561: wow pve so exciti- ResidentSleeper
[1:02:20] azzy_dog: Warriors might be gods of dmg in dungeons and meters but as a pvp player they were always in a rough spot. They can crank parses but otherwise they are mage fodder
[1:02:21] bisonzx10r: come on... says the guy who took every Ony bag for his 5 sets of gear, topping meters and even taking gear for flask set lmao. people are so sick of warriors and their degen antics
[1:02:24] SamDavidsin: what more do you want
[1:02:25] KhanoTV: They are only gods when they have support from every other class. BUT to get to that you had to suffer along the way
[1:02:26] jschroe3: warrior logs in gnomer so far not good
[1:02:28] iPlayCuzFun: if im being totally honest. with 1 healer warriors are OP... i can charge in and do 1 whirlwind for 40% hp on everyone in 8 yards
[1:02:32] jschroe3: so that logic is flawed
[1:02:48] don_kneee: LMAO
[1:02:50] bronchoped1: There it is LUL
[1:02:50] iPlayCuzFun: ally tank: pala > warr (in dungeons, not raids)
[1:02:51] don_kneee: get in the backpack
[1:02:51] nodnarB_: KEKW
[1:02:52] wreck561: what does that have to do with warriors as a whole? lol
[1:02:53] KombatWombat07: le oof

[1:03:05] don_kneee: LOL
[1:03:11] nowheretoday: LMAO I was wondering the same
[1:03:11] rider_96: I would never hate watch you
[1:03:13] bisonzx10r: i dont hate watch you. i like your streams. why do you think that?
[1:03:13] bronchoped1: Because warrior is good with every buff in end game raiding in classic that means they have to be boring in sod.  What a shit take
[1:03:14] jschroe3: tell that nerd to leave
[1:03:15] don_kneee: @Ilove_togetwet ROFL
[1:03:16] spicydeluxe_: but I feel like if you don’t play melee it’s boring
[1:03:16] ObrezKnight: @bisonzx10r literally the reason for that is that warriors are so weak you have to get flask set to have a chance in pve
[1:03:17] Artiriouz: cause he hates his life
[1:03:18] rider_96: So setsy
[1:03:19] miloxz: hatewatchers unite

[1:03:55] bisonzx10r: you did though, how would i know that unless i watch you. dont take it personally, its just the class that attracts so many egotistical people

[1:04:15] Artiriouz: @bisonzx10r youre an idiot if you think that, look at rogues and mages ROFL
[1:04:15] KairuruTV: well the thing is @SONII the ONLY thing most of the wow playerbase cares about is logs and parses, and thats what warriors are good at
[1:04:21] OlBoris: LOL
[1:04:22] Artiriouz: THATS LITERALLY ROGUES KEKW

[1:04:37] markm230: in all honesty the guys not wrong lol
[1:04:38] TobyNova: soniiRage
[1:04:40] jschroe3: well done
[1:04:40] Artiriouz: mages and rogues are the biggest egos in this game KEKW
[1:04:43] eskivoart: VIIIIIIIBES

[1:04:49] DadRage: 1000000000%
[1:04:49] spicydeluxe_: warrior
[1:04:50] TobyNova: soniiSip
[1:04:51] vepsee: mages have god complex
[1:04:51] spicydeluxe_: kek

[1:05:13] OlBoris: hunters are just kids lol
[1:05:15] OlBoris: difference
[1:05:24] rider_96: Im just mad ur stream wants me to watch 8 ads and its not happening
[1:05:29] TobyNova: *eats bone broth flavoured popcorn*
[1:05:29] CAD604: but warriors had the largest weapons in vanilla therefore op... the end, fin.
[1:05:30] Hasslemoff: Fellow warrior main here.    'The situation' is fine, it's a single phase and not end game, enjoy the time with ur friends in this arcade version of the game.    I can't understand why a significant portion of the community is complaining about armour/balancing, you can kill the bosses with any comp as long as you do tactics.  Some classes feel more 'interesting' but love how the runes have changed warrior tanking.    Just my two cents!
[1:05:35] KhanoTV: ITs what we did on pservers
[1:05:38] spicydeluxe_: “need” for your healer set, fire set, etc etc
[1:05:40] nixxor: BRUH WHATTTTTTTT< YOU TOOK ALL THE BACKPACKS!!!
[1:05:40] Korvynah: my mutilates hit for 900 and my evenoms 1500 i kill people in a stun and Soniis getting rosated on Warrior LUL
[1:05:42] KhanoTV: Warriors had to have so much gear
[1:05:42] spicydeluxe_: I understand
[1:05:48] rider_96: On my phone?
[1:05:49] eskivoart: >:) ad blockage activated
[1:05:49] TakeMeToValhalla: you gonna go the ironforge gym and flex on those bitches ?
[1:05:52] rider_96: Its a phone
[1:05:53] bisonzx10r: you literally just said in your last AB "fucking hybrids do something useful like heal me". this attitude permeates through classic and A LOT of warriors have this entitled mentality.
[1:06:02] rider_96: Can't get ad blocker on a phone
[1:06:12] TakeMeToValhalla: @rider_96 can on android
[1:06:25] zdravimdruzstvo: @rider_96  purple tv , android app , no ads
[1:06:28] twitterlesstyler: @sonii I need you to explain this to me like I'm a small child. Why is Pluto, a dog, owned by Mickey? Goofy, who also is a dog, is one of Mickey's closest pals and is able to freely walk and talk in the world yet Pluto is stuck being owned by another being, forced to live in a house outside.
[1:06:33] rider_96: Damn
[1:06:35] Artiriouz: THATS ANYONE IN PVP KEKW
[1:06:37] M4sterPe4ce: Do you have an addon command?
[1:06:38] rider_96: Im so ignorant
[1:06:40] spicydeluxe_: I want my tank to be confident tho
[1:06:41] Artiriouz: jesus this kid is delusional
[1:06:48] CAD604: played a rogue for 14 years... definitely the largest egos
[1:06:49] rider_96: Now i got roasted
[1:06:50] bisonzx10r: @Artiriouz nice projection
[1:06:53] vepsee: um no they cast starsurge not rejuv
[1:07:02] Korvynah: i mean warriors are great with a pocket but its the fact they need a pocket in a team fight environment that is the issue
[1:07:07] OlBoris: @bisonzx10r its becuase warriors need it to function
[1:07:11] IrisFromAlaska: EZ
[1:07:15] OlBoris: in pvp
[1:07:17] Artiriouz: @bisonzx10r says the guy calling every warrior egotistical, take a look in the mirror
[1:07:17] eskivoart: they need that soni d
[1:07:22] bisonzx10r: @OlBoris so maybe be social and premade with people instead of just "expecting" it from people
[1:07:30] bisonzx10r: @Artiriouz cope and seethe
[1:07:31] ObrezKnight: I remember playing mage in classic with my best buddy being a warrior and It always struck me how weak warriors were and how they had to completly cuck to be tanks and even when they got BIS 2h they still got crapped on in pvp by every other class
[1:07:32] chadmcdudeyo: But it is endgame for like 2 months..
[1:07:37] eskivoart: bro def mains a hunter

[1:08:15] azzy_dog: Whatchu need?
[1:08:19] Ragemax_TV: Boon that DMF?
[1:08:21] DonSombrero: @IrisFromAlaska because the majority of players are pve
[1:08:22] nowheretoday: Level up your dw
[1:08:22] Artiriouz: @DadRage i only eat stuff thats bad for me im an egotistical warrior KEKW
[1:08:26] DadRage: OMEGALUL
[1:08:26] Korvynah: @IrisFromAlaska because blizzard said their goal is to balance the game around pve and pvp comes second
[1:08:29] heroxenophanes: 2h wars are the only class, as a boomy, I can still beat post nerf
[1:08:29] Nahno: That's the problem, the people saying they like warrior or warrior is fine is because they only play PVE content
[1:08:35] DadRage: So the red kind Kappa @Artiriouz
[1:08:41] ObrezKnight: I cannot for my life come up witha  sword spec
[1:08:42] eskivoart: on a scale from 1-10, how hard is gnomer rn?

[1:09:28] vepsee: gnomer is easy classic andies just cant grasp more than 2 mechanics
[1:09:36] sherlock0408: you got a macro list somewhere?
[1:09:49] KairuruTV: hes got 5 of them

[1:10:16] DadRage: Bobka's a MrDestructoid that's why

[1:25:16] eskivoart: I would love an ability that heals you for a certain amount of damage that you do. and maybe u have to re click the CD after a certain point or you explode like the gearrs of war reload idk
[1:25:18] the_snarf: applicable song lol
[1:25:19] Artiriouz: YOU KNOW HOW MANY OUTS A ROGUE HAS?!?

[1:25:40] sander1no: @SONII I think you should voice your opinion in a carefully written forum post. I don't care about top damage, I care about the runes being BORING AF

[1:25:57] BIEM491: I am a 40 shaman and I am getting beat in pvp by 37 hunter because I can't get near him
[1:26:11] ObrezKnight: Start by stopping the damn limmitations on our kit, why can't we victory rush all the time why only after kill?
[1:26:17] grylz89: @biem491 go ele

[1:27:26] Korvynah: We dont need it
[1:27:33] Artiriouz: fuck it just make SoD retail and give every ability why not
[1:27:33] OloCdn: cloak got datamined already
[1:27:35] eebuK: rogue is feeling so much smoother at 29 w/mutilate than my warr was at 33 lol glad  I switched yesterday
[1:27:36] azzy_dog: I feel like war really does need a better hp regen, let them stay in the fight for longer than the 2.5 seconds
[1:27:40] cleavlin: 2H arms or fury?
[1:27:46] azzy_dog: Yes!

[1:28:15] jism08: 10sec 90sec cooldown
[1:28:18] jschroe3: and flashy
[1:28:24] KhanoTV: I said it before, but if warrior was MoP warrior they would be perfect
[1:28:44] Pstrosos: !song
[1:28:45] KhanoTV: MoP was so fun on warrior
[1:28:46] azzy_dog: Give warrior anti magic shield for 2-5 sec and give them a pull ability
[1:28:55] EmpurityTV: bro, just got the stv mace,
[1:28:59] EmpurityTV: its so dogshit
[1:29:11] sander1no: STV Mace is worse than Bonebiter in PvE
[1:29:13] biiggy: wait till we get to 60
[1:29:14] darsoldis: How about that Ahmpy hunter melee clip? wild
[1:29:18] vepsee: people are just jaded by the absolute dogshit pve meta classic has been for the last 20 years with stacking warriors
[1:29:21] vepsee: people dont look at pvp at all
[1:29:22] EmpurityTV: bonebiter is much better
[1:29:25] CwoodAGG21: @sander1no how come?
[1:29:25] biiggy: when everyones all epic loot
[1:29:29] myodoctor: does healing gear make blood thirst heal more?
[1:29:35] markm230: dont reroll hunter fellas they enjoy getting the dick daily with all the nerfs
[1:29:35] iPlayCuzFun: its good in melee cleave and in pvp. dog shit in pve
[1:29:35] mitchp333: I mean hunters are the best melee class I guess now.
[1:29:36] sander1no: @CwoodAGG21 You can't get 5% crit from talents
[1:29:37] buffguylol: What time is gnomer?
[1:29:49] Korvynah: ive been grinding arathi and bloodmoon
[1:29:51] vepsee: pve and farm, this is why pvp died in retail lmao
[1:29:51] voteforpedro064: Warriors are tricky because if they make them good then they absolutely destroy like everyone. So its tough making them playable but not overpowered.
[1:29:53] Artiriouz: log off
[1:29:54] Korvynah: PVP OFC
[1:29:54] SamDavidsin: farm crafting mats for $$

[1:30:01] sander1no: @CwoodAGG21 So you have to compensate in weapon damage for missing 5% crit, which the mace just doesnt quite do the job of
[1:30:02] eskivoart: been trying to figure that out for the pat 20 years
[1:30:05] 0xLisko: AB now. thats the best bg
[1:30:06] azzy_dog: @SONII my brain is fried from SM. got a easy weapon swap macro?

[1:32:23] squall1882: Off topic: Would you reco the YLA flagship track pants?
[1:32:26] Djbunny162: PVP in MMOs is so insanely hard to balance.
[1:32:39] TobyNova: Is it worth just leaving Warrior for now till they fix things? You did get the epic staff on your SPriest soniiFeelsGood
[1:32:39] Djbunny162: When 85% are pure PVE
[1:32:53] Icelol123: I think they care, but it’s just insanely difficult to balance
[1:33:23] kogoth23: crap I need a guild invite again :D
[1:33:28] vepsee: sadly BDO is heading down that road too, lot of shit pvp changes, seems like they're finally trying to grasp the pve players

[1:34:17] Korvynah: @Deftvx not loud enough
[1:34:18] novvum: Theres some games that focus it and its goes good
[1:34:19] vepsee: I really hope ashes of creation can pull it off with the pvp systems and a good pve side
[1:34:19] happytreesz: this is why they introduce resilience :|

[1:35:06] UnderpantsPoD: So that I can show my soon to be girlfriend how good I am at video games Kappa
[1:35:10] novvum: PVP balance and it needs to be in the game to get some BIS GEAR. WoW really focuses PVE than anything
[1:35:11] winnson23: That suits stop making the games and it goes back to geeks that loved gaming making the games
[1:35:11] nowheretoday: Lol
[1:35:28] Ragemax_TV: I think you can tank 2h arms, last 2 bosses hit hard tho
[1:35:34] neon_wow: sheesh
[1:35:35] Ragemax_TV: or fury prot
[1:35:39] MrSlyth: true
[1:35:45] aggamor: When are you going to so gnomeregan today?
[1:35:53] eskivoart: soni you should keep that DM screenshot on all stream from now on
[1:35:54] Ragemax_TV: might have to sword & board on last 2 boss
[1:35:55] antikiller1205: i could destroyed as warrior tank
[1:35:58] antikiller1205: at last boss
[1:36:03] MrSlyth: I havent played a good game or enjoyed a game since playing the start of classic. When we had the all out war Alliance vs. Horde open world pvp
[1:36:08] aggamor: Wait one hand arms the move?
[1:36:08] suritv: !talents
[1:36:08] Nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/ToughTriumphantWasabiFailFish-EUX9SgQPwiupty4B
[1:36:09] thiccqt: the last boss hits for like 800-1k   with a shield on
[1:36:18] antikiller1205: better to go proper tankspec @SONII if ur tanking
[1:36:21] eskivoart: u right u right that might be toxic lol
[1:36:22] vepsee: also whats happening with the sod 1v1 tourney
[1:36:23] vepsee: you playing?
[1:36:31] thiccqt: u wont hoild aggro as deep prot
[1:36:31] Ragemax_TV: With ur gear that's why i said go deep prot
[1:36:32] Artiriouz: i wanna know when we're gonna get dual spec
[1:36:35] roodiep: definitely do Deep prot
[1:36:37] roodiep: way easier
[1:36:46] thiccqt: you barely get rage
[1:36:48] Lytehaes: Yeah need more stam before arms
[1:36:50] thiccqt: devastate hits ofr nothing
[1:36:52] vepsee: wars threat is dogshit
[1:36:56] vepsee: on last boss
[1:37:01] 777zs: wars struggling with threat atm
[1:37:02] hoyden: with the shamen threat buff it should be fine whatever you go
[1:37:04] Gimilkin: chat why is he an undead but says he plays a tauren ?
[1:37:08] antikiller1205: too much armor dont get rage
[1:37:09] Ragemax_TV: Yah it's not great, I struggled
[1:37:11] thiccqt: Rage gen is absolutely miserable
[1:37:19] vepsee: rogue/shaman/lock
[1:37:20] sander1no: OH WOW? WARRIORS STRUGGLE AS TANKS TOO? hehehehehhehehhe
[1:37:21] vepsee: are amazing
[1:37:22] MrSlyth: enrage is not the way
[1:37:24] Wirblewinde: fury/arms is fine, just make sure you have stam gear and not full str/agi dps gear
[1:37:25] Ragemax_TV: All the armor like they said makes it hard for us to generate rage
[1:37:35] Wirblewinde: and AD feelsbadman
[1:37:38] Outplayrs: ya dude i tanked gnomer deep prot last night it was miserableeee
[1:37:45] Tdoh__: yoooo
[1:37:45] thiccqt: i was chugging rage pots on cd lol
[1:37:46] sander1no: What a fkin surprise - they literally nerfed the spec for no reason and the new runes they added are soo fkin cringe
[1:37:51] TTVnakke: when's gnomer
[1:38:05] vepsee: legit worst tank rn
[1:38:07] vepsee: cause of the armor
[1:38:08] eskivoart: yeah dude i cant keep aggro
[1:38:08] vepsee: lmao
[1:38:23] nowheretoday: You didn't have defiance tho
[1:38:38] thiccqt: Ahla put up 280 overall dps last night warrior will probably be middle of pack
[1:38:43] vepsee: its doable obviously cause its classic and shits easy but not ideal
[1:38:46] eskivoart: i feel like the devs mustve been bullied by a warrior at one point in their lfie to be this way
[1:38:48] Thoresen: !addons
[1:38:48] Nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/DistinctAuspiciousDiamondFUNgineer-uyXrDaNHSgdqEAJ1
[1:38:56] antikiller1205: improved sunder armor on deep prot and 5 parry or so from arms
[1:39:06] beiiiiko: what’d I miss why can’t you tank as warrior properly
[1:39:10] antikiller1205: and 5 crit fury unsure if points are enough
[1:39:35] thiccqt: Fight club has all the tanks going arms cause deep wounds is stil lgood
[1:39:38] vepsee: rogue tank is actually pretty good due to how much threat they gen, supposedly the highest ST tps
[1:40:14] thiccqt: our war struggled pretty bad to hold threat (we are alliance and had salv)
[1:40:16] betacocos: A shaman can help you out with threat btw, spirit of the alpha buff for 45% more threat
[1:40:19] thiccqt: Should be fine with shaman buff
[1:40:23] Thoresen: what addon makes enemy debuffs visible over the nameplate?
[1:40:35] azzy_dog: Need a shaman? :D
[1:40:37] thiccqt: no wf means log out
[1:40:41] Brendon0769: Wanting to play classic, what's the difference between classic era and seasonal servers?
[1:40:45] SpacebarBarbarian: shaman are the backbone of the horde
[1:40:47] vepsee: they really need to tune the armor down a bit like they did with BFD magic resists
[1:40:49] vepsee: shits rough
[1:40:52] Deftvx: thoughts on league of legends? xD
[1:41:11] thiccqt: they will probably nerf the armor in half and hit melee hunter next tuesday
[1:41:12] Nazeal2: have you been using Slam at all? I like it. I can’t stand using Quick Strike it never hits hard or barely crits. thoughts
[1:41:17] sodaxdpapi: EXCEPT FOR WWARRIOPR KEKW
[1:41:18] Herculas95: how do y show rend over enemy plate?
[1:41:19] sander1no: Kinda funny how they added insane amounts of armor to bosses in gnomer whilst they just reduced MR on bosses in BFD after complaints from casters hahahha fuck blizzard 4r4r
[1:41:22] BIEM491: My class is not as down bad as warrior but I am not having a good time in phase 2
[1:41:27] vepsee: @Brendon0769 era is perma progressed static content, this seasonal is a new take on classic with abilities/content etc
[1:41:29] sledgehammmy: i respect tf out of the saltiness towards sod warriors
[1:41:37] eskivoart: ppl speed running it tho
[1:41:46] trevsee: Did first Gnomer last night - was fun went 5/6
[1:41:53] antikiller1205: less stuff to do, since bfd gear is enough good, no need to prebis farm really
[1:42:06] vepsee: I hope they bring back prebis farming next phase
[1:42:12] vepsee: one of the fun things for pve players
[1:42:14] BigbadKevin: xaryu still levling so
[1:42:15] azzy_dog: We have a lot of time in p2 :p
[1:42:18] CAD604: and those speed running it are going to be the first to claim there's nothing to do.
[1:42:22] thiccqt: just bring nature pots and you can ignore most mechanics lol
[1:42:27] nowheretoday: I'm still 32 lol
[1:42:27] voteforpedro064: the last boss was so much fun. we ended up 3 healing it to get it down
[1:42:38] Thoresen: chat, what addon makes his enemy debuffs visible over the nameplate?
[1:42:39] McNerdSauce: 35
[1:42:51] McNerdSauce: he wants 40 by friday

[1:42:55] Outplayrs: so whats the ebst warrior tank spec right now?
[1:42:57] Icelol123: Well he does have a kid now
[1:42:58] pmanfit91: pmanfit91 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:42:59] 777zs: haha he knows theres not enough stuff to do

[3:10:22] ShaneiumTheCranium: Fire Nova, Maga Totem RB, and its over
[3:10:29] Doansy: Fire nova rune makes the aoe aggro on you not totem
[3:10:29] the_snarf: we also get earth shock (Taunt) on a dif cd than other shocks, so we can constantly swap and hit with a high threat ability

[3:21:07] Ponthastic: bfd worst tho
[3:21:11] yarrpeter: what do you think will be 50 then

[3:21:26] DrLegend305: Sunken Temple
[3:21:26] GetRktNerd: SUNKEN TEMPLE
[3:21:26] antikiller1205: ST or BRD
[3:21:31] limburgse: BRD
[3:21:31] Astralthundr: ST
[3:21:34] Korvynah: ST was supposed to be a raid so
[3:21:36] Soviethammer: Any fat loot?
[3:21:37] limp0h: no mara runs for Jokered hahaha
[3:21:38] kindNifti: I hope it's not brd
[3:21:38] mrbluesky1337: maraudon
[3:21:38] exequtegg: BRD would be INSANE
[3:21:39] Ebkwow: SM raid!
[3:21:41] TheBoolin: Imagine like a massive raid that was Scholomance combined into Stratholme
[3:21:42] antikiller1205: ST would be boring with minibosses
[3:21:43] adog6218: what at 60 Scholo?
[3:21:44] BL4CKATTACK: No way they make it brd lol
[3:21:57] Korvynah: its either sunken temple or brd i think they both were intended as raids
[3:21:57] antikiller1205: yea brd too long prob
[3:22:00] crazyboy1_: zf raid would be nice for 50
[3:22:00] BL4CKATTACK: It's already too long
[3:22:01] antikiller1205: ZF or ST then
[3:22:01] darvent: by that logic ST then for 50
[3:22:06] dunnie48: Mara
[3:22:10] RyeBreadOnly: @Soviethammer he ninjad fist weapon from melee hunter
[3:22:14] auntyjemimah: zul farrak raid

[3:22:17] OlleverTV: there is many options for 50
[3:22:19] vimovo: karazhan crypts I thought was hinted
[3:22:21] captain__ak: zul farrak would be cool
[3:22:28] Playonwordz: ZF raid would be sick
[3:22:31] limp0h: @RyeBreadOnly the hunter didnt even want it - since he wants to go ranged :)
[3:22:31] DaSeegs: BRD raid?
[3:22:34] antikiller1205: 2 raids would be nice but prob not happening
[3:22:35] Qrucials: ST is perfect just need to organise it a bit
[3:22:37] veiloflonelystars: we geting the season of mastery raid changes at 60 aswell
[3:22:42] captain__ak: I imagine it will be back in the western kingdom
[3:22:45] RyeBreadOnly: @limp0h twas a joke
[3:22:46] limbohousetv: debuffs above enemy nameplate addon or weakaura?
[3:23:00] MattWoody757: think they said 5 phases, so 2 60 raids
[3:23:00] mctoastyham: BRD is to big
[3:23:05] Korvynah: why not just go old school and pvp with a pocket healer. the war damage is there
[3:23:10] Korvynah: until things balance out
[3:23:17] adog6218: any tips for dealing with smaller injuries?
[3:23:41] MattWoody757: Karazhan will be awesome
[3:23:42] theonethatsurvived: where would you rank warriors compared to other classes in pve?
[3:23:53] Korvynah: well boomy got nerfed into the ground so they tickle now. starsurge hits 300 non crit
[3:24:00] Korvynah: shadow priest is still a major issue tho
[3:24:04] Slaughter13x: yo @SONII you grub chipotle?
[3:24:04] Nightbot: yo
[3:24:08] veiloflonelystars: would be amazing if they made a 20man version of tbc kara at 60 for part 1 and then part 2 kara crypts NEW content
[3:24:19] Tdoh__: @adog6218 continue doing the same lifts, but much lighter in a pain tolerance of 2/10 till you can make the loads heavier in my opinion
[3:24:21] iRayG2: farthest back can just los fyi
[3:24:32] Mel0ns: just use the elevator with 1 ranged
[3:24:33] adog6218: loving the music today
[3:24:39] Mel0ns: LOS it
[3:24:49] MattWoody757: omg yeah veilo
[3:25:12] Tdoh__: @adog6218 i powerlift and have had many small injuries and this is how ive overcame them, even working with a powerlifting rehab coach this is what he tells me to do, and is a doctorate of physical therapy
[3:25:26] adog6218: @Tdoh__  might have to try because I just need to be moving can't sit on my ass anymore for what seems a light shoulder injury I just worry a lot of doing more damage

[3:25:48] maxiebeee: @SONII did you used to tank in original classic I wasnt watching then
[3:26:14] Tdoh__: @adog6218 ive had a rotator cuff injury, that lasted legit like 7 months of pain, i just kept benching but lightly, in a pain tolerance that was not much pain at all and eventually it went away and i started being able to lift more
[3:26:29] Mission_plausible: how is the new raid? any good. @SONII
[3:26:34] drvichyssoise: do you think thunderfury will be good at 60? or do u think they do anything to the legendaries

[4:51:04] Shepp22: don’t pallys have tremor totem rune?
[4:51:13] Loco_Gam1ng: @SONII i have to tell you one of the best reactions i saw out of you was when you got one of your kills in the mak go ra tourny. and you like stood up and flexed. traps looked huge, sonii is a god as per asmongold
[4:51:15] saitama1312: beast

[4:51:50] miloxz: whats ur opinion on warrior in phase 2?
[4:51:55] Concani_: @veiloflonelystars true, but i liked the map looks and everything, just the garrison idea that was terrible. hoping for the wod classic some day
