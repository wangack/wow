[0:29:39] Aspmann: @letho_og It's slow, boring, takes forever and you wish for dampening to be a thing even though dampening itself is the worst mechanic. Also every annoying part of the game got more annoying
[0:30:05] letho_og: i miss TBC 2s
[0:30:16] mexiferalx: i mean 2s in cata is ultra slow if u play healer dps comps

[4:26:34] deathsp1tter: lmfao
[4:26:39] deathsp1tter: not really
[4:26:48] dinamiits: its not always about what victim can gain, sometimes its about what accused person can lose

[4:28:43] demongodxtv: yea they dropped him from everything
[4:28:52] kitra__: allegations like that never really entirely escapes your career or story
[4:29:19] proserpina9: He got cancelled, lost contracts, etc. But ffs most victims aren‚Äôt Amber.
[4:29:31] proserpina9: Most victims are so sick like she is/was.
[4:29:35] proserpina9: Aren‚Äôt *
[4:29:41] ensefe: season stats?
[4:29:49] NoManele: ofc... once you are accused you are kinda fucked no matter if you are guilty or not
[4:30:00] gotemg1: is it a 2s angle
[4:30:07] deathsp1tter: In todays age theres too much noise against innocent until proven guilty

[4:31:04] gotemg1: he is playing with albraik 2s
[4:31:06] deathsp1tter: majoirt dont
[4:31:09] deathsp1tter: majority
[4:31:42] deathsp1tter: its a retail angle
[4:31:53] xarlivenow: they need soloq and enable to buy pve gear with arena points
[4:31:57] xarlivenow: in wrath classic
[4:32:09] ekunx: the war within BatChest
[4:32:26] dinamiits: it would be like warmane then, doubt they will ever do it
[4:32:30] deathsp1tter: would be amazing to see you log on for a week, swipe r1 on rdru in shuff than dip like nothing happened
[4:32:31] deathsp1tter: ;)
[4:32:39] proserpina9: @deathsp1tter plenty but not most, and reporting is a whole drama too. To be believed, to have been ‚Äúsmart‚Äù to gather proof of things when the crime was happening, etc. It‚Äôs complicated.
[4:32:39] kkush2: copium
[4:32:42] Timehaze: What could go wrong?
[4:32:43] trikkSP: surely, cant be another fluke

[4:33:56] dinamiits: majority play pve so
[4:34:08] dinamiits: they dont rly care about pvp
[4:34:10] deathsp1tter: @proserpina9 Yeah, It's complicated. But people not reporting their assault is a part of the issue of "no justice".
[4:34:20] meepo604: exactly, news flash - pvp is dead
[4:34:22] gotemg1: he is playing with azmoddan

[4:39:51] mogiejonge: the rng is why tbc was shit
[4:39:55] gotemg1: spottman is in dalaran waiting for u to inv him
[4:39:57] ensefe: i was fine with the rng but mace stun through a pillar on nagrand b/c tauren hit box was rough
[4:40:23] ensefe: RNG made you avoid just pure script play
[4:40:43] deathsp1tter: proceeds to miss 3 clones in a row
[4:40:47] Totterhovna: imagine if blizzard not added retail title system and it was only way to get r1 - stack with others, we would have opportunity for content dramas etc but it is what it is @Minpojke
[4:41:00] ktp_blue: Rng is annoying when it makes you lose but it's also not enjoyable when it makes you win a game either.. I dunno
[4:41:11] mogiejonge: @ktp_blue yep
[4:41:25] ekunx: @ktp_blue i agree with this

[4:58:16] dinoynwa0607: what do you say about the disc/sub gameplay in arenas ?
[4:59:13] kooolzin: if the dpr doesnt play like this they lose in 10 seconds

[5:01:28] fortchx: takes a certain kinda masochist to play 13h a day of dpr
[5:01:52] Totterhovna: @Minpojke ngl but watch dpr while you played with Mir was more fun to watch compare to Avi+Gekku/his current priest
[5:01:52] icntblvit: 30min
[5:02:21] gotemg1: I think dpr vs warpal. Its more exhausting from the warpal POV
[5:02:52] fortchx: double dps seems way more fun imo, dpr sounds good on paper but then the reality of queuing 47m wp games doesn‚Äôt sound v fun
