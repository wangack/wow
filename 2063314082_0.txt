[0:00:59] yomawma: !allegations
[0:00:59] StreamElements: graycen has 1472 allegations against them! pastaThat
[0:01:07] sepph_: I am so close to unsubscribing from Graycen. Don't have anything major against him but he is way too out of line even when he is joking or whatever. He is so toxic and arrogant that it brought questions for me, one of them is why does he continue streaming? He is probably even worse in real life. Just way too annoying. And then it occurred to me.
[0:01:08] Rawhiders69: duckPls
[0:01:12] catjammespam: alizeePls
[0:01:12] sepph_: Graycen is a jackass, unfortunately. Yeah he is cute, silly and probably gives amazing head, but perhaps i should stop living a dream of thinking that Graycen is this shy, kind and a loving person. He changed over time, for worse. He can be rude to other people as well in many of the videos, being rude to strangers included. The truth sucks so much but ever since he and Ang broke up he hasn't been fixed. At least not entirely . I hate to say this but i want the old and kind boy called Gary back.
