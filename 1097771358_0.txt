[4:56:58] Gethrian: Isn’t there a stream delay?
[4:56:59] Eyeshield5: snutz too good
[4:57:01] manloadx: Guys, the genius of what Calyx did was just the right pressure, he basically gave the priest no good option, he could run away from his team, he could run into warlock heat or he could stay in range of the warrior. There was no option the priest really liked, and whatever he did Calyx would maintain the advantage
[4:57:17] toxokin: probably not streaming during these matches was a better idea
[4:57:32] manji123: music is realy bad
[4:57:51] Bixboarn: are NA and EU gonna meet
[4:57:54] vlvdimirovnv: classic is garb

[4:58:21] holyjedi: I like that music but it might be just not not the best choice for the moment
[4:58:26] blar7: Music reminds me of how many years we all wasted on such a bad game
[4:58:28] rodneystevenage882: i didnt know snutz is a cheater i hate that guy now
[4:58:54] RosetuneWW: cant blame him tho, still fair game, he just used the resources that was given to everyone /shrug
[4:58:55] alyaperitv: no honore
[4:58:58] toxokin: perception against a drood is stream sniping now?
