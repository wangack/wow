[1:37:43] AtomicHydraa: my point exactly they literally autobahn people just playing the game it‚Äôs no secret
[1:37:45] serenityee: they're not baning people getting gold via cuts after the total pot is done. Its the essence of gdkp which is buying items for gold. So it affects gbid also
[1:37:47] theradoor: wrath also had a huge botting problem, so no wonder GBIDS have a rise in popularity. gold is almost worthless

[2:17:06] ehte2493: The wow player base will find a way to fuck up the game. Anyhow
[2:17:07] Fiftyninetwitch: bro GS is awesome so we can skip shiet geard ppl and not have shietttuh grp
[2:17:08] druidnatorr: @JokerdTV Just link logs not GS
[2:17:11] Marnikx: @JokerdTV asking for GS now is asking a todler to do a iq test b4 kindergarden
[2:17:18] shamtasticcc: so instead of gdkp's ppl just gonna sell full raid carries with 6 boosters and 4 carries nothing really changes

[2:17:41] Sarpedeon_101: @JokerdTV wont that mean they will just switch to personal loot soon
[2:17:43] Fiftyninetwitch: @Marnikx no it is so the grp doesnt boost nakeds
[2:17:43] ProxianLUL: not entirely true. Theres A LOT of bad classic players with high gear score that constantly do less dps than people with lower gear score/even fresh alts
[2:17:43] miraagex: Why would they delay the raid? Why not let good players clear it on day1-2?

[2:18:15] ProxianLUL: @Niksen_99 true
[2:18:16] miraagex: @Brain_Freezed "As a compromise for both leading edge players and more casual players, the raid dungeon will become available with the launch of Season of Discovery Phase 2, but there will be two lockouts on the normal weekly lockout timer at the start of the phase"
[2:18:17] exstas1234: ban gearscore ReallyNice

[3:36:30] TrenerTrener: @Jakob My thoughts exactly
[3:36:33] Drazimo: @Dash4cash723 Sure, but with the new things to stop botting they've said, and GDKPs being harder, it'll stop certain people.
[3:36:39] Yolonardo_: what are the big sod news guys?
[3:36:53] Niyco: Niyco subscribed with Prime.

[3:37:37] Vohry1: @JokerdTV why are you only lvl 25 you been playing for months???
[3:37:39] biblenexus: Have they given their reasoning for banning gdkp?
[3:37:41] dunark_: is gdkp a thing in retail?
[3:37:42] thegummibearmassacre: Aside from the gold they were claiming GDKPs ruin the "spirit" of the game. Less people in guilds and whatnot because they run them.
[3:37:44] SirStefoto: sod is cool
[3:37:58] wtfblub: blizzard does the bare minimum i doubt they will go hard on enforcing the gdkp ban KEKL
[3:38:05] snajgela: Hey @JokerdTV ! I haven't seen your stream in a long time. How many daggers have you been able to find?
[3:38:06] TrenerTrener: @biblenexus They wanna try it out bcs they dont think its the way sod should be played is  pretty much it
[3:38:10] thegummibearmassacre: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/blizzard-bans-gdkp-runs-for-classics-season-of-discovery-phase-2-337424

[3:38:16] rodavlasilad: chat do i needa to use my drums before reset or can i hold them and still get later today after using or how does that work
[3:38:21] sulltan95: @JokerdTV what prof are you dropping for ench
[3:38:24] CeX360: its gonna be a lot easier to control  gdkps than the bot issue
[3:38:29] mcstealth666: LFM gnomer xxxx item HR will be new meta
[3:38:34] Nurmat: CLASSIC
[3:38:41] Demobalderes: GDKPs existed in real wrath, cata and then kinda ended in MOP. Idk why, though
[3:38:41] segelduk: they could start with hiring a GM and banning all bots running in and out of stockades
[3:38:53] Facelessmnl: @Demobalderes personal loot
[3:38:56] flebbooo: Now people need on all big items in retail and sell them since gold is cross server
[3:38:56] sulltan95: @JokerdTV im keeping tailor and eng on my priest
[3:38:57] Demobalderes: Guess content was too hard, and personal loot
[3:38:58] Syzlak3: blizzard cant solve bot and gold buyers problem so they baned GDKP
[3:39:03] Dash4cash723: people can just create an discord and do gdkp announcements there no?
[3:39:07] Byshash: @rodavlasilad you can hold them, the item is weekly but it will only drop if you dont ahve one already, or the buff active. so you can use that one and get another one later in the week
[3:39:08] Beunhaase: As ret the sp is good aswell no?
[3:39:14] wtfblub: i bet there will be underground discords who create gdkp groups KEKL
[3:39:19] gdkpgold: √≠ts 20 dmg not attackpower
[3:39:25] cryoxgm: ench tailor is gonna be bis for caster
[3:39:40] SirStefoto: yeah, they balance stuff, so it comes to player preference what to do
[3:39:42] spanij: @JokerdTV hi man r u mad that blizzard took out gkpd dude?
[3:39:45] SirStefoto: its quite cool
[3:39:48] rodavlasilad: @Byshash ty!
[3:39:57] Facelessmnl: they will probably track gold trades for raids items
[3:39:59] mcstealth666: i mean they just said its gonna be banned but not how they gonna enforce it wich is intressting
[3:40:00] Cahilo: im noob, how can enchanting give 20 dmg or spellpower ?
[3:40:04] Dj_Oo__: running around without boon leveling is gna be so sadge @JokerdTV
[3:40:19] Yoxdaa: Still HR runs are more aids than gdkp, now they gonna pump @jokerdtv

[3:41:16] Brelshar: o7 CICIBAN
[3:41:16] Dash4cash723: how can they ban gdkp, people will create discord out other platforms announcements and make groups there right
[3:41:16] ambatukek: 39 META KEKInsane
[3:41:16] gdkpgold: selling bfd boon drop 50g

[3:41:53] Vohry1: LUL i was kinda expecting ppl getting fucking bfd wb at 60 for MC KEKL
[3:41:56] Gokublue001: lol
[3:42:00] tecncaldificltes: isnt the xp buff only 1 - 25
[3:42:00] cook_pc: people have run out of characters to need it on
[3:42:01] Kyfoon: @SNIFFFA balance? tailoring imo
[3:42:09] brabpraps: Same in Darnassus
[3:42:22] Puppytime: most people have the trinket, so much less turn ins
[3:42:30] grundel91: POGPOG
[3:42:34] smander: I thought they said no World Buff WIth Gnomer?
[3:42:38] Demobalderes: If they don't give move speed ppl will mald

[3:43:38] rullehjem: HOLY COPIUM
[3:43:38] Denz0TV: There's a reason the movement speed zanza at 60 is considered so good
[3:43:39] ExhaustedPenguinz: gnomeregan buff?
[3:43:43] simonromlie: @Facelessmnl I think its too far gone on Era/WoTLK for them to ban it on either of those 2 versions

[4:21:59] HappysFunPalace: @BarkBevastation because banning it means you get rid of 90% of them essentially solving the issue

[8:53:36] Tatekei: if they have 3 month long seasons then yea we'll have multiple 60s, levelling being broken up into chunks is going to give people ample time to be raiding on 3 4 or 5 characters throughout, personal belief i have 6 25's right now. im thinking 4 will probably be raiders at 60 - have never bought gold before, also have every ts at cap right now.
