[2:20:56] JigsawSaint: According to the suit, CD Projekt didn’t disclose enough information that Cyberpunk 2077 was buggy and “virtually unplayable” on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
[2:20:59] PrimalRain: doubt major investors are suing, they still made bank
[2:21:00] Staksor: he also sold all his stocks right before game release, because he knew the stocks would drop. this should be illegal too

[2:22:59] Sollice: CDPR is yes, and to be honest they probably deserve it. You should not be charging $60 for a game on consoles you know you can't run it

[2:24:52] whiskeycrayon: yea but people need to chill out with the death threats to release the game on time, and now with death threats because it's not working great
[2:24:53] Sollice: @trevybnasty Next Gen ones are having some issues, but thats because they are not actually next gen versions yet. They are just upscaled. They are releasing a next gen patch "soon"
