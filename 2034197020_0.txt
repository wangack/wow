[2:54:57] KembriaTV: You're not putting in the correct number of versa @GingiTV You need to put the total number in, not the DR %
[2:54:59] zymweth: Prayge good run
[2:55:03] fitsgerald100: @GingiTV you put in wrong vers value, you should put in the "normal" %, not the DR %
[2:55:06] kallisz: i think

[3:00:30] blizzardpolice69: allowed this key
[3:00:35] KembriaTV: Storming with charge monkaS
[3:00:37] happyfunrockk: Don't know how I feel that the limiting factor to doing high end keys is the fact you just get one shot on bosses.
[3:00:54] admiraltegetthoff: @tempestyn you can outrun it, you can bait with mirror images and other pets aswell
[3:01:05] kwizzzz: @happyfunrockk it's bad balance
[3:01:23] blizzardpolice69: different metas for different classes
[3:01:24] blizzardpolice69: Gladge
[3:01:42] InvokeGaming: boomy needs to play mushroom in here
[3:01:45] mr_j0ker92: -20
[3:01:47] nuggiw: Woud you recomend balance or fire mage? for keys
[3:01:54] creepywalker: balance
[3:01:58] bingbongsanchez22: damn aug players man Kappa
[3:01:58] creepywalker: Balance>fire
[3:02:02] aloken1312: fire for pugs

[3:02:07] creepywalker: Destro lock > Fire

[3:02:28] aloken1312: no but you get invited
[3:02:28] nuggiw: @aloken1312 true + boomkin does not make much dmg while gearing
[3:02:29] MCSwagdooodle: survival hunter > ALL Kappa
[3:02:30] blizzardpolice69: in a non survival meta aug would be trash, unless people did insane uncapped pulls and needed to survive
[3:02:35] viribus1unitis: world first 32?
[3:02:38] blizzardpolice69: then that would be fun for everyone

[3:04:01] KembriaTV: LUL
[3:04:02] thericepilaf: @blizzardpolice69 m+ scales infinite, surviving will always be the meta
[3:04:17] InvokeGaming: not really
[3:04:23] InvokeGaming: its usually timers
[3:04:25] spaeltchenbtw: clean run so far Copege
[3:04:29] fremen14: @thericepilaf thats just not true tho. in other seasons timer was the limiting factor. stop yapping
[3:04:36] blizzardpolice69: @thericepilaf some M+ metas are pushed by damage and ur not gated by insane bosses
[3:04:36] KembriaTV: It's almost always surviving @InvokeGaming :)
[3:04:39] goblingher: @thericepilaf just depends if the mob hp bricks key or damage you take
[3:04:42] Dcss97: comes a certain point that living is not the issue its damage
[3:04:51] NeoFrostBug: i think evoker is useless for mdi
[3:04:54] blizzardpolice69: some metas have insane bosses and u need a certain amount of utility to survive @thericepilaf
[3:04:56] NeoFrostBug: doesnt help with dmg
[3:04:57] thericepilaf: how many groups playt with aug in 30+?
[3:04:58] Echo_Esports: It’s Christmas time! New World First mousepad is now available!! Buy it now and get 15% off all other merch at: echogg.ly/merch/Gingi

[3:05:20] mr_j0ker92: i dont understand why he is playing so close to pack if he is ranged
[3:05:21] Romerr: Romerr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:05:22] blizzardpolice69: it's a survive meta that's why it's strong
[3:05:30] Arkshol: there is some 31 with no aug
[3:05:30] MCSwagdooodle: @thericepilaf 0
[3:05:34] creepywalker: @mr_j0ker92 to profite from group heals
[3:05:42] creepywalker: easier healing for drid
[3:05:51] fremen14: @creepywalker @mr_j0ker92 LMFAO so he doesnt get the juggernaut chargers

[3:05:55] velle014: @mr_j0ker92 So charges go on mirrors/Lys and not on nhim
[3:05:57] fremen14: you guys are actually clueless XD
[3:06:01] loew3nzahn: no heal druid in there XD the bait charge from a mobn i think
[3:06:02] Ralynx: @creepywalker HUH
[3:06:02] thericepilaf: @thericepilaf and chats telling me augs not meta kekw
[3:06:04] dadgamer_o7: do you gain dps from playing far as ranged xddd
[3:06:08] ReSeT_VT: drid healer Susge
[3:06:15] mr_j0ker92: thx chad :D
[3:06:19] TyrasDemon: he is standing in group so the other guy gets charged
[3:06:25] caughingdonkey: theres an idea that aug isnt meta bc a few people put it in their titles, then now they are playing w aug
[3:06:35] Dcss97: why range stand in melee when he range he bad at game check him pc sadgeCoomer
[3:06:40] caughingdonkey: just trolling the community really
[3:06:47] KembriaTV: People heard 1 thing on a streamer's stream about aug and they're just parroting it back in twitch chat FeelsGoodMan
[3:06:58] caughingdonkey: exactly
[3:07:14] caughingdonkey: theres like 5/100 high keys wo an aug in time
[3:07:35] blizzardpolice69: Aug allows you to survive any key pretty much with disc and allows you to bring boomy for mark
[3:07:39] KembriaTV: 99% of people don't even know what breath does on aug, let alone their entire toolkit
[3:07:41] Ralynx: @yaminosennin i think people are hoping the no aug meta catches on
[3:07:41] blizzardpolice69: u also get beam
[3:07:42] TiPera: aug is huge when u have a team
[3:07:44] InvokeGaming: disc aug boomy good
[3:07:46] somethineuw: you can always be an aug hater I support the cause
[3:07:55] alitaloncey: canexx Sadge
[3:08:00] dzona9: No aug is good for lower keys but on highest keys its meta
[3:08:02] creepywalker: augm is just very boring to play
[3:08:13] vernare1982: Why He died He leaped away
[3:08:18] kwizzzz: meta is double mage no aug nonverbal
[3:08:21] Radsol54: i think its realy fun to play, if you play as a pseudo healer/dps

[3:08:37] Radsol54: if you embrace a support roles its fun imo
[3:08:44] JanDeGrote1: Aug is meta because living for the highest keys not damage also you don't need one for your 22 key KEKW

[3:09:19] Radsol54: @Ralynx true
[3:09:22] somethineuw: its crazy that aug is supposed to add survivability but almost all pug augs get randomly oneshot
[3:09:22] Moobot: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[3:09:27] FareweII_: aug is straight up BAD for lower keys, worse augs+worse dps player+no comms, you lose like a 100k dps at least comparing to a 3rd dps

[3:13:38] creepywalker: to me its crazy how people survive the dmg in this kinda keys , i struggle to stay alive in lower keys while not standing in shit or so
[3:13:40] fremen14: i bet 100 bucks that you wont see aug in mdi
[3:13:42] strandberggg: @randyspears_ Based

[3:14:03] ReSeT_VT: @blizzardpolice69 GIGACHAD
[3:14:07] Mersias22: aug is big buff for the healer , if they are many squishi ppl.
[3:14:10] stujitsu: Bucks KKona
[3:14:11] blizzardpolice69: GIGACHAD
[3:14:20] Radsol54: @재치있는 dont have to insult people, but you may be right about mdi, since its lower keys.. doesn't mean its not better for big ones
[3:14:23] KembriaTV: @Hred5 8 deaths :(
[3:14:29] kenzjzo: @재치있는 aug is only good for high high keys, mdi they dont do high keys
[3:14:35] NooboniousPrime: why are they in this dungeon? are they still playing BfA and not Dragonflight?
[3:14:44] JanDeGrote1: @yaminosennin not sure maybe you should poke them on discord that you offer coaching for 200$ an hour Kappa teach these nubs
[3:14:45] ReSeT_VT: Chatting
[3:14:46] HawP_P: @NooboniousPrime yes
[3:14:47] inda262: @NooboniousPrime bfa mdi replay
[3:14:51] kwlski01: @NooboniousPrime yea its nostalgia mhm
[3:14:52] fremen14: @Radsol54 im not insulting anybody, youre wrong in saying that 3 dps is less dps than aug + dps tho
[3:14:55] MCSwagdooodle: See guys! even a pro gets feared, play your best yeh!
[3:14:58] oshide: yea it is not live
[3:15:01] mr_j0ker92: @NooboniousPrime they playing BFA free to play server

[3:15:13] KembriaTV: @JanDeGrote1 Gingi already contacted me about it on the down low Kappa
[3:15:13] creepywalker: gingi got feared! i knew im pro i dont get feared
[3:15:15] creepywalker: woohooo
[3:15:20] Setekun: is CLICKZARD live?
[3:15:27] fremen14: @Hred5 ?? you can check logs LMFAO
[3:15:30] NooboniousPrime: they should really play retail, and not this Classic BfA server
[3:15:34] creepywalker: also 300k dps is very mid
[3:16:00] kenzjzo: @creepywalker yes 300k is really bad with aug
[3:16:02] sulozor: Timer looks SUS
[3:16:14] Moobot: No random links allowed! (@Hred5)
[3:16:15] creepywalker: get aug out bring windwalker
[3:16:21] sandecharlie1992: good dmg mike!!
[3:16:25] fremen14: they timed 31 AD with 17 deaths they fine KEKW
[3:16:29] KembriaTV: @Hred5 I think you're smoking a bit too much
[3:16:30] walkleydev: timer is ok IMO
[3:16:34] caughingdonkey: wo aug this key would already be done
[3:16:40] caughingdonkey: and theyd be doing 31
[3:16:43] creepywalker: aug is a meme
[3:16:49] creepywalker: no need twitch has spoken
[3:16:49] walkleydev: no aug >>>>
[3:16:55] Ralynx: Is there any reason Gingi has some dungeons on 20/not done at all? Is MDI certain dungeons so he avoids others?
[3:16:56] kenzjzo: @creepywalker never gonna happen because ww has no fking survive
[3:17:03] creepywalker: haha i know mate i main one
[3:17:05] NeoFrostBug: i dont understand why yall keep yapping about aug when its obvious they wont use aug in a +25 at MDI
[3:17:11] creepywalker: till 25 its fine after that its struggle
[3:17:13] firemklol: aug gives a lot of utility
[3:17:16] blizzardpolice69: Aug is broken for reasons that arent damage, it's how they interact with certain classes and surviving
[3:17:18] JanDeGrote1: @Ralynx he was on vacation so he only just started pushing with the boys
[3:17:23] blizzardpolice69: mostly the fact the interaction with survivig
[3:17:30] blizzardpolice69: But they survive big pulls
[3:17:31] caughingdonkey: thinking that they wont pull the entire instance in 4 pulls in mdi
[3:17:38] Denekyy: half the chat typing but they are doing max 18s
[3:17:39] creepywalker: but isnt boomkin also kinda squeeshy ?
[3:17:45] fremen14: im noticing a lot less tank deaths from naowh since they started playing with aug
[3:17:47] GLOCKXWORK: Chatting 󠀀
[3:17:53] Hred5: yeah nice save by the aug there Chatting
[3:17:57] KembriaTV: @blizzardpolice69 People are also just very clueless about aug's breath with damage profiles, especially fire mage/boomkin
[3:17:58] Ralynx: @JanDeGrote1 both dawns he has on 20 only this week so idk
[3:18:01] thericepilaf: @blizzardpolice69 thank you for your insight
[3:18:12] caughingdonkey: it was a good save, see the tank is still alive
[3:18:12] theoddvan: @Denekyy wrong, im doing 11s
[3:18:15] creepywalker: @Denekyy why cause different opinions?>
[3:18:20] walkleydev: eta gg

[3:18:59] AIemaan: WeirdChamping
[3:19:03] Hred5: meeres timing  30's with no aug no bl and yall still yapping Chatting
[3:19:11] MapucheEnjoyer: We are at  point where the problem isn't that the comps lack damage, the problem is the damage taken I the key sowhat they prioritise is survivability
[3:19:13] kwlski01: @firemklol everything is relative weSmart
[3:19:15] admiraltegetthoff: F that's rough on timer now
[3:19:15] creepywalker: you need andytank for it
[3:19:16] crixo16: They need the dk utility ok
[3:19:17] creepywalker: andy kicks ass

[3:20:03] caughingdonkey: imagine talking like a 14 year old
[3:20:05] Kedor2k: @MeeresTV Go live man
[3:20:08] KembriaTV: Some of the best players in the world timing+30s on off-meta specs does not prove your point in any way whatsoever @Hred5
[3:20:12] xchayu: would it be more doable if snapping would still work?
[3:20:12] Ralynx: How long would last boss take on 32?
[3:20:17] Radsol54: nice try boys
[3:20:28] creepywalker: anyone wanna group and help me with my +56 BRH ?
[3:20:32] JanDeGrote1: @strandberggg well my throne is still a 37 hard key you know Kappa
[3:20:38] alb1nn0: noboady has done one yet
[3:20:40] ReSeT_VT: wouldnt it be a good idea to try the last boss? @GingiTV
[3:20:44] Lorviina: when is mdi?
[3:20:46] ReSeT_VT: just asking
[3:20:47] firemklol: @ReSeT_VT true
[3:20:48] thericepilaf: @creepywalker tbh thats too low of a key for me in do big keys
[3:20:52] NooboniousPrime: unironically, is balance only being brought because of vers buff and big AoE?
[3:21:03] KembriaTV: @NooboniousPrime No

[3:21:06] InvokeGaming: boomy does infinite damage
[3:21:07] ItsXolten: @hred5 Aug isn't even meta are you dense?
[3:21:07] creepywalker: @thericepilaf ye but i do as affliction lock
[3:21:20] arito21: bench canexx get kush
[3:21:22] TrenerTrener: @ItsXolten How is aug not meta in high keys?
[3:21:23] KembriaTV: Boomkin is good in pretty much every regard, except for not having a melee kick but in this comp, beam is insane
[3:21:25] neriumttv: gingi, what is the process like when i'm also trying to do group callouts/inteerrupts like you. I feel like i don't know some abilities of new classes
[3:21:33] NiuBiNiuzao: @GingiTV can you show dmg breakdown please?
[3:21:39] creepywalker: so were did Havoc go?
[3:21:46] pbugq: did gingi just start his push?
[3:21:47] creepywalker: was it all ahype?
[3:21:52] MapucheEnjoyer: @nooboniousprime boomkin is one of the classesw8thmore damage but it is very difficult cause it has low survivability
[3:22:01] blizzardpolice69: FORTNITE
[3:22:09] Ralynx: @GingiTV Any idea why the juggernaut melee'd you?
[3:22:17] ReSeT_VT: forget about havoc there's Meres on DK with orange stick YEP
[3:22:18] drektftw: @creepywalker did you miss the 2 times it got nerfed
[3:22:20] NiuBiNiuzao: @GingiTV can you show dmg breakdown please?
[3:22:21] KembriaTV: @MapucheEnjoyer Low survivability KEKW
[3:22:25] InvokeGaming: boomy does more damage than havoc and vdh brings the raid buff
[3:22:31] creepywalker: @drektftw still there dmg is kinda high?
[3:22:34] CazaTV: is that "true health" a WA?
[3:22:35] ItsXolten: @trenertrener Look at Nerfs team they said they are filtering out aug because they believe it won't be the best
[3:22:41] thericepilaf: @InvokeGaming this guy is on something today
[3:22:43] InvokeGaming: andys team still plays havoc tho
[3:22:56] KembriaTV: Because andy plays prot pala
[3:23:02] blizzardpolice69: bro some ppl still use flip phones
[3:23:07] shiizuma: @InvokeGaming cuz he are pal prot
[3:23:08] blizzardpolice69: and they billionaires
[3:23:17] InvokeGaming: @thericepilaf check logs
[3:23:27] TrenerTrener: @ItsXolten So Nerfs team is the one and final decision, they decide whats meta? Just look at high keys on raider io, if you dont call aug meta you are just wrong, sure you can say its not obligatory, that doesnt mean its not meta
[3:23:27] MapucheEnjoyer: @yaminosennin u out have to change into bear form to have a defensive apart from the skin one and it has a decent CD but not enough
[3:23:33] Radsol54: be kind to one another boys, we all here to support these GOATS
[3:23:36] KembriaTV: Chat trying to understand comp choices in 30+ keys PogChamp
[3:23:37] NiuBiNiuzao: @GingiTV can you show dmg breakdown please?
[3:23:40] thericepilaf: @thericepilaf u check logs bro!
[3:23:48] KembriaTV: @MapucheEnjoyer Bear form is broken af
[3:23:49] JanDeGrote1: @TrenerTrener Yeah nerf team made it meta to disband if anyting KEKW
[3:23:54] kaverrr: Gingi is a billionaire. He just bought a coffee machine for €20k
[3:24:02] TrenerTrener: @JanDeGrote1 Non verbal
[3:24:15] moca95: why kevin no streaam
[3:24:21] creepywalker: @kaverrr just bought an appartment in dubai myself , this coffemachine is nothing
[3:24:21] kwizzzz: nerf switched to protpal with aug by the way, just so this discussion doesn't die, you guys are doing great
[3:24:21] kwlski01: @kaverrr 2k not 20k
[3:24:29] marcuusjj: 2k gift WutFace
[3:24:29] MisaokiTV: Ask Kenn to stream plz ! <3
[3:24:32] KembriaTV: So you have 100m then, not 1b?

[3:24:49] Radsol54: holy this pull lol
[3:24:52] ReSeT_VT: the fucking mount gingi is riding  in game is more expensive than that coffee machine LuL
[3:24:53] MissAvantasia: @kaverrr I gave it to him. missavaKEKW
[3:24:53] kaverrr: that’s clearly a lie. Naowh said it was 20k
[3:24:53] Stinth: Pog then he can afford to gift 9 chatters a coffee machine
[3:24:54] creepywalker: @yaminosennin hahahah
[3:24:54] Bardimir: still worth less than a BoE-ring with avoidance
[3:24:57] BrewstGaming: what's the weak aura or addon that shows every cast they do and target, above his picture? above his health bar
[3:24:58] NooboniousPrime: time warp was .0023 seconds off, send the +30 AD
[3:25:07] MissAvantasia: 20k swedish @kaverrr . Get facts straight
[3:25:19] nerefwow: go +30 Chatting
[3:25:24] mirso_07: That POOL
[3:25:25] MapucheEnjoyer: @yaminosennin and u waste like 3 secs between changing forms and using the def on bear form while not doing damage, meanwhile other classes have invulnerability and can do damage, I'm not a booking fan but apart from bear and the skin one there is no good def, and when u do high end keys cheat death is almost a must or something that prevents u from getting a oneshot
[3:25:25] kaverrr: @missavantasia that’s a really nice gift 💪
[3:25:25] mirso_07: Omg
[3:25:30] Hred5: xdd
[3:25:30] mirso_07: That is Crazy PUll
[3:25:32] creepywalker: just go back to +20 guys its no shame
[3:25:33] creepywalker: :P
[3:25:34] Radsol54: that pull is amazing
[3:25:35] Hred5: 32 easer than 31 xdd
[3:25:40] blizzardpolice69: they gonna go god mode here in a minute
[3:25:41] fredrikhalvors1: storming fuckd that up
[3:25:45] thericepilaf: @MapucheEnjoyer aug isnt meta
[3:25:45] KembriaTV: @MapucheEnjoyer But you live stuff

[3:26:28] neriumttv: show gear plz
[3:26:33] MapucheEnjoyer: @yaminosennin  just saying that booking has lots of damage but it lacks defs compared with mage,rogue, lock or dh that are the meta specs
[3:26:36] blizzardpolice69: @Vaiilz HeyGuys
[3:26:41] justyell0w: why do you keep items in bp from s1 Hmm

[3:27:18] KembriaTV: @MapucheEnjoyer You definitely live more than a dh as boomkin. Mage and rogue just have broken survivability and lock vs non-rot
[3:27:20] BrewstGaming: @GingiTV what's the weak aura or addon that shows every cast they do and target, above his picture? above his health bar

[4:18:52] skaadooche: balance is so balanced
[4:19:07] admiraltegetthoff: is dk or moonkin higher dps with like giga mdi pulls?

[4:19:35] Stahn1993: @skaadooche i mean this is pretty much the boomie godcomp. don't think they are in an OP spot compared to other classes
[4:19:46] Xoan_Dk: maybe Dk is more damage, but Dk has nothing more while druid bring the buff and more utility
[4:19:57] SossoGoMVP: there is no way priest can heal that without any target
[4:20:11] admiraltegetthoff: true
[4:20:12] skaadooche: @Stahn1993 they scale in higher keys where there's always giga pulls, mage too
[4:21:01] get_carter_lol: !mdi

[4:21:12] MaelarethTV: !MDI
[4:21:22] admiraltegetthoff: reason im asking is meeres would be their moonkin i guess so hes either moonkin if its best or maybe dk too bc he has exp on dk and traditionally dk was really good in big pulls idk

[5:04:25] zerossussy: bf AR into snd then open with ER
[5:04:34] JustObSoLEET: you want a 25 sec timer pre key btw @GingiTV
[5:04:51] zerossussy: should be better yes
[5:04:55] zerossussy: according to sims atleast
[5:04:58] zerossussy: sims does it that way
[5:05:05] ElRicardoTV: sims OMEGALUL
[5:05:19] zerossussy: you do get cdr on BF that way
[5:05:29] zerossussy: so you usually have BF as first global or after 1st finisher
[5:05:33] JustObSoLEET: as soon as you pop 25 sec timer pre key, you want to 0 Adrenaline Rush, Roll the Bones, Blade Flurry, Slice and Dice, Keep it Rolling, Stealth
[5:06:12] MadaMada24: How did the +32 Atal Dazar go?
[5:06:17] Atte0825: how do you decide which character have you as main in raid?
[5:06:21] JustObSoLEET: Then when 10 sec timer ends after key is put in, ADR again, roll and then KiR if you get 4 buffs

[5:06:58] Alaylayla: gingi have you thought about doing a Weakura that shows you the amount of GCDs left in stealth, so you know whether a BTE that you queue will be in time or not
[5:06:59] zerossussy: you need to enter crackshot at 7 cp, but not while broadside is up
[5:07:01] zerossussy: small minmax
[5:07:19] Alaylayla: drjay has one that puts a green border on his BTE if there is enough time left in stealth to fit a BTE

[5:09:10] bogeskov: make sense
[5:09:10] jaco163: I know you don't pug a lot, but do you in general prefer playing with mw or disc?
[5:09:17] visherara: gingi what do u think the best GPU for raiding and cheaper one?

[5:10:53] Dreamz66: no, always roll before
[5:10:53] Moobot: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[5:10:59] xHinklebobx: jpc rolls during vanish and dance too so i guess it is
[5:11:13] Viisionz74: B4 but if u are at 1 buff its prob worth to roll in dance
[5:11:16] arito21: sims say its the same, discord says no
[5:11:17] xHinklebobx: prob depends on buffs id imagine
[5:11:20] Adrenzy: where is it showing
[5:11:23] Cyberkaia_: dance = vanish. so yeah, roll on dance
[5:11:35] Cyberkaia_: roll on dance and BtE on dance
[5:11:36] JustObSoLEET: you will KiR inside dance for sure
[5:11:36] Dreamz66: depends also on the buffs and how much you could gain ig
[5:12:05] zerossussy: only roll in crackshot if you have loaded dice up and you have only 1 rtb buff active otherwise u never reroll during crackshot @gingitv
[5:12:28] Viisionz74: @zerossussy This

[5:14:57] JustObSoLEET: I had a version of it at one point that did exactly what you're saying and James didn't like it so I took it out
[5:15:09] xHinklebobx: you should roll before using adrenaline rush so you can reorll after vanish window on pull to get guaranteed 3 buffs
[5:15:19] JustObSoLEET: and he does more dps than any other rogue so i just did what he said lol

[5:16:29] Stinth: Hmm
[5:16:49] JustObSoLEET: There's a weakaura triggering RtB when 5 sec remaining, then there's one when you have 1 buff and loaded dice
[5:16:56] JustObSoLEET: and then theres one for after KiR
[5:16:57] Maelnstorm: @Stinth looks like Afenar's WA
[5:17:03] Evjon_Fjorgen: who is the most buff world first gamer in history
[5:17:12] JustObSoLEET: it will pop up when your buffs are under 39 seconds
[5:17:15] zerossussy: its telling you that you got loaded dice
[5:17:17] JustObSoLEET: and you have LD
[5:17:34] sv3nne_: Why is he on the rogue?
[5:17:47] daabzii: @sv3nne_ rogue's got biggest buff ever
[5:17:50] titoiii84: rerolling to rogue ? Kappa
[5:17:55] JustObSoLEET: Yeah it triggers inside stealth
[5:17:56] zerossussy: loaded dice does not matter with post KiR at 39 seconds its situational @GingiTV
[5:17:59] daabzii: Kappa Kappa
[5:18:12] Grimm303: isnt there a custom option to not trigger in subterfuge
[5:18:14] emazing17: its when you use your finishers and get the 5s extras
[5:18:15] JustObSoLEET: I told James I could add condition to not pop up in side stealth but he didnt want
[5:18:21] Grimm303: for rtb one I think tehre is maybe not that one
[5:18:35] Bloocked: banger song, what is it?
[5:18:48] craggaz: any reason for the human switch ?
[5:18:59] zerossussy: you only reroll in stealth in the opener if u have 1 buff active with loaded dice
[5:19:02] zerossussy: not much there into it
[5:19:05] zusuu54: @craggaz Rep farm for the start of the patch
[5:19:07] Toskens: Need weekly key on anyone? Got an AD 21 ^^
[5:19:07] zerossussy: it'll never happen again
[5:19:08] emazing17: so when you’re hammering BtE’s you’re gonna get 2x extra rolls and it will flash for the 1 or 2 seconds they overlap
[5:19:08] JustObSoLEET: do you want it with that condition?

[5:21:03] zusuu54: Merees is lookiong for raiders @GingiTV
[5:21:04] JustObSoLEET: @zerossussy what's the threshold?
[5:21:26] zerossussy: @JustObSoLEET theres no threshold as sims just send rtb right at 39 sec no matter loaded dice
[5:21:34] zerossussy: as it only differs in 1 buff and barely happens
[5:21:43] zerossussy: so its not gonna change it significantly in sims

[5:23:19] JustObSoLEET: i believe you
[5:23:29] imjp21: @JustObSoLEET Is this rtb weak aura available anywhere?  Looks way better than any others i've seen.
[5:23:29] JustObSoLEET: I just put that condition in cause he told me to
[5:23:36] AFD_Xypher: cause you had good buffs there gingi
[5:23:46] zerossussy: @JustObSoLEET what condition exactly if i may ask?
[5:24:00] boomchi_: not working :P cant enter the game WutFace
[5:24:04] JustObSoLEET: yeah so KiR wont pop until buff hits 2 sec, to let you milk for 5 or 6 buff
[5:24:07] iccyc0ld: bones is a chance ability?
[5:24:17] JustObSoLEET: @zerossussy the loaded dice for 39 sec reroll
[5:24:40] JustObSoLEET: if its not optimal I'll tell james that I took it out and resend it to him
[5:24:46] zerossussy: ur fine doing both, he gets his answers from solo
[5:24:52] zerossussy: and we talk about these things everyday
[5:24:57] JustObSoLEET: cause you could get 6 buffs @GingiTV
[5:25:01] boomchi_: finaly! after 7 restarts of the launcher xD
[5:25:01] Grimm303: for 6 >:)
[5:25:06] GothicWolfLight: to get chance on 6 Kappa
[5:25:06] HotDadWithNoKids: because kir only goes to 60 seconds

[5:25:15] zerossussy: also btw sims dont fish for CTO
[5:25:19] Volun_: more gamba
[5:25:23] Grimm303: arent 6 buffs better than 5 KEKW
[5:25:30] zerossussy: overall u want to keep KiR on cd thats why, both are neutral tho
[5:25:31] youaresogoodz: arms or fury m+?
[5:25:51] zerossussy: the gamba of fishing for 5 buff is neutral
[5:26:03] iccyc0ld: ask Kush? KEKW
[5:26:10] JustObSoLEET: the weakaura will pop up at 2 seconds
[5:26:11] Nitjr: im still struggeling when to reroll or not. I do get 3 buffs, but how do I get the 4th if my roll is rdy to use?
[5:26:14] Epiclawlzable: what weakaura gives you the bones buffs over your target?
[5:26:19] zerossussy: i wouldn't make the WA pop up after 2 seconds
[5:26:24] zerossussy: it can pop for 1 second only

[7:54:51] azurehq: do u actually quest on all these chars or just do the weekly stuff ? so lvl to max and then only M+ and raid ?
[7:55:38] Hurbob14: @azurehq they did the renown 20 before the raid released
[7:55:42] Hurbob14: on all chars
[7:55:49] azurehq: so theres not like a main whos collecting mounts and stuff or achieves
[7:56:17] Hurbob14: i mean most likely there are players who do. but gingi dont
[7:56:18] Hoodwinkel: account wide anyway
[7:56:46] Systero: that mount is sick
[7:56:50] Breadguy_BE: Gingi what classes do you think on their own have the highest survival in m+
[7:57:06] happyfunrockk: Mage ^
[7:57:06] Moobot: A few spots have opened up for my Winter Fitness Program. Read more here https://bit.ly/4aVJKsn if you'd like to get in shape before summer! 😎
[7:57:31] azurehq: @Hurbob14 yeah i was just wondering if Gingi cares about that stuff u know :P always feels like the ppl who totally "nerd" the Game are the best players aswell
[7:58:08] Systero: and we also run 40% vers
[7:58:17] N00B_L0RD: tell kush to play nooblord build
[7:58:17] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Gingi and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[7:58:26] the_sip_: Id say DH/pally if youre talking survibability as well
[7:58:37] Thomas_Huayra: Warlocks not up there anymore?
[7:58:38] kromaNNcs: How was Thailand mate? :D
[7:58:41] sarpogne: for a tank player who wants to flex dps… would you recommend rogue or mage? (id like to invest time on a class that i can play on long term)
[7:58:52] N00B_L0RD: dh dies to air
[7:59:03] the_sip_: DH good for rot, but you also have netherwalk
[7:59:04] Critcried: Ill tell you whats not... Enhance
[7:59:11] weisyboy: how about fire mages?
[7:59:15] deeehzz: netherwalk, blur and darkness
[7:59:20] jurashh: blade dance aswell i guess
[7:59:22] Sbrigz: ret with rageheart crazy survive for sure
[7:59:22] just_ie: what about shamans KEKW
[7:59:27] Breadguy_BE: who would be your top 3?
[7:59:35] the_sip_: DH not good at surviving one shots, but ticking damage DH hard to kill
[7:59:40] maedoxxx: if u play around deflecting dance u can live a lot of things
[7:59:43] Thomas_Huayra: Not warlock?
[7:59:43] benjaburger: krona best player
[7:59:53] sitmeee: Enhance is fine if you dont take any damage
[7:59:53] nalegi07: how OP would mage be if Cauterize was a class talent and not fire specific
[8:00:48] just_ie: @sitmeee smile just dont get hit :)
[8:00:53] kromaNNcs: Which class would you say you're best at? :D
[8:01:01] nalegi07: frost cheat with double wall that heals 80% KEKL
[8:01:03] azurehq: but u cant double iceblock in M+ right ? cause of the rotation atm
[8:01:24] nalegi07: @azurehq you can, coldest snap takes cone off cold snap
[8:01:25] the_sip_: WW also has like 4 defensives and is vers class
[8:01:30] sarpogne: for a tank player who wants to flex dps… would you recommend rogue or mage? (id like to invest time on a class that i can play on long term)
[8:01:32] dustix75: so sub does more dmg than outlaw? or just burst?
[8:01:42] Roshanqt: why are everybody sayin outlaw ist best and echo players play sub? :D
[8:01:47] e_palmer: Sub best
[8:01:54] azurehq: ahhh wow okay thanks
[8:01:55] N00B_L0RD: sub is best spec in the game so
[8:02:00] N00B_L0RD: yeah
[8:02:05] Hopefulx: you need sub rogue coaching?
[8:02:13] N00B_L0RD: u need to play kushbuild
[8:02:46] cowboykurt: ignoring hopeful Stare
[8:02:54] koOmaa: @GingiTV is sub Rogue harder to play than Outlaw?
[8:03:02] e_palmer: yes @koOmaa
[8:03:03] koOmaa: haven't tried it for years
[8:03:17] Thomas_Huayra: it's also subjectively more fun that Outlaw
[8:03:20] sarpogne: en
[8:03:22] e_palmer: Currently it is much harder
[8:03:26] Thomas_Huayra: than outlaw*
[8:03:30] koOmaa: what makes it harder?
[8:03:40] PhAnToM1004: sub takes brains, outlaw you just press cooldowns when they come off cooldown
[8:03:41] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[8:03:46] koOmaa: @Thomas_Huayra yeah I'm not a big fan of Roll the Bones tbh
[8:04:51] koOmaa: Might try Assassin instead if sub is harder than Outlaw. Outlaw feels pretty APM intensive
[8:05:32] e_palmer: Sub is slower than outlaw
[8:05:43] e_palmer: just very specific unforgiving burst windows
[8:05:44] Systero: assa needs 4 aug and 10 PIs to work, sub only need to play decent
[8:05:55] Jack_the_Dipper: Can anyone tell me what he uses to show the combo points? WA?
[8:06:14] Heyez_: padding DansGame
[8:06:27] azurehq: is black powder not respected in the Sub community ? :D
[8:06:28] blazinghott: Perfecto is called Simon? I thought he was greek
[8:06:30] koOmaa: @e_palmer so you need more knowledge basically?
[8:07:01] SiSHYA: hello gongo hope you're doing well :)
[8:07:07] nalegi07: no toxic patch is Despairge
[8:07:07] blizzardpolice69: fortnite battle royale ez cash cups
[8:07:11] e_palmer: @koOmaa I mean yea the rotation and cooldown placement change a lot from boss to boss so you def need to do some research
[8:07:27] e_palmer: Sub you go BSL its insane
[8:07:30] Agent0rang33: oh shit, Gingi good to see you back my man, sadge the stream cut out so suddenly yesterday
[8:07:30] gambitenjoyer: yeah its good for M+/farm
[8:07:31] PhAnToM1004: sub is 2x lining i believe
[8:07:32] Tgloss22: blue silk for sub
[8:07:37] kekestyle: Hekili ftw! :D
[8:07:39] nalegi07: depends on uptime tbh, in farm blue silk is probably better damage
[8:07:39] dustix75: 1k mastery while above 90% health is nice
[8:07:40] Exorcist_PG: BSL
[8:07:41] koOmaa: hmm
[8:07:53] ZhranVL: so shotcaller guide video when hahah
[8:07:58] dustix75: lol is hekili good?
[8:08:01] Dcss97: pipe burst huh? thats why stream stopped
[8:08:06] Dcss97: OMEGALUL
[8:08:16] koOmaa: @e_palmer how is assassin? iyo
[8:08:27] Agent0rang33: Hekili is a great learning tool, but not 100%
[8:08:31] dustix75: assa is good in early tears but lags behind
[8:08:38] koOmaa: I guess I just gotta try all 3 specs for a while
[8:08:39] dustix75: with more stats
[8:08:45] e_palmer: @koOmaa It got nerfed into the ground but its very slow
[8:08:52] koOmaa: aaah
[8:08:53] AverageChameleon: wtf
[8:08:54] kekestyle: @Agent0rang33 yep, for the feeling of a class. i tried it on dh
[8:09:04] nalegi07: assa is still plenty strong, esp on add cleave fights
[8:09:06] gambitenjoyer: damn wtf
[8:09:08] Prime_Rage: holy f 488
[8:09:12] gambitenjoyer: bro has 489 pips ashes
[8:09:13] koOmaa: Maybe I just stick to Outlaw
[8:09:16] gambitenjoyer: basically bis
[8:09:20] gambitenjoyer: just needs to get dt 489
[8:09:21] koOmaa: I just wanted something slightly slower

[8:09:25] azurehq: kush is such a nerd
[8:09:25] e_palmer: It is shit compared to sub and other melee specs currently
[8:09:26] koOmaa: But sub so many buttons lol
[8:09:28] ace50: better get R1 every boss with that gear
[8:09:32] blizzardpolice69: 1v1 boxfights in game and irl
[8:09:33] dustix75: i just leveld a rogue yesterday in 13 hours and leveld as combat but i want to pump so i should swap sub for raid eh
[8:09:33] koOmaa: complicated stuff
[8:09:40] Heyez_: kush EZ Clap
[8:09:50] gambitenjoyer: @dustix75 outlaw is good on some bosses than sub on others
[8:09:52] Agent0rang33: eff the ilvl Gingi, the mog is on point
[8:10:12] nalegi07: @koOmaa try using some weakauras that help with reroll and KIR if you use that build
[8:10:14] gambitenjoyer: @dustix75 would just look into subcreation will tell you tierlist based on parses for each boss, you can play only sub if u want tho
[8:10:15] giorginats: what was that glaves wehre it drops ?
[8:10:16] nalegi07: helps simplify things
[8:10:18] dustix75: i use to be good enough to swap specs ill have to play it more i parsed blue on normal with 430 ilvl felt good lol
[8:10:40] ace50: @dustix75 as long as the ilvl % is good
[8:11:04] dustix75: im just an aotc champ tho not a mythic andy
[8:11:15] gambitenjoyer: doesnt matter, as long as u have fun lol @dustix75
