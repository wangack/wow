[0:07:11] gordastico: but hazel didnt you have like a millon alts back in legion?

[0:07:41] anker_jym: As a Warlock main during Legion, the warlock order hall and campaign are the best. No bias
[0:08:07] GreenArrowed: loooove the warlock order hall campaign
[0:08:10] Thaxorin: love the colouring of the hair :)
[0:08:14] GreenArrowed: as a game long warlock. also no bias.
[0:08:17] wolfcloudchaser80: I watch an art/comedy YT channel and they told a story where their cat managed to hit a a key that deleted all the photoshop layers on a drawing they were doing.
[0:08:17] heldtheline: The warlock order hall is awfully cozy, if you hang out with the succubi.
[0:08:19] Zuldak: the alt color warlock class hall mount is a rare spawn on the broken shore iirc...
[0:08:23] Ryok: this week again i threw my 14 alts into the tuskarr soup and again got 1 flavor pocket D: i won't complain about a weekly 40k gold but i wish i would get more than 1 xD
[0:08:33] stroveee: hazel do you play classic?
[0:08:38] GreenArrowed: @heldtheline honestly best order hall
[0:08:48] Thaxorin: I got old crafty yesterday :)
[0:08:58] jeffrey_ghostdive: i'm more excited for 10.2.7

[0:09:54] GreenArrowed: you get used to it
[0:10:00] goplacidly56: the new twitch drop pet is cute
[0:10:08] Ryok: @Zuldak yeah last week i sold it for 43333 today it was down to 41999 D:
[0:10:20] Ryok: @Zuldak i really wish i would've started this farm months ago
[0:10:34] anker_jym: I feel like a Warlock's sense of smell has burned away at this point
[0:10:41] Kurama__95: It's Amazon Prime drop
[0:10:45] goplacidly56: Cap'n Crackers
[0:10:46] Ryok: captain crackers
[0:10:46] sence_00: Prime loot
[0:10:47] cashthb: prime gaming thingy
[0:10:50] Ujai321: cptn crackers?
[0:11:10] Zuldak: so was cptn crackers the pirate flag on the road map?
[0:11:11] wackpoetic: take those tokens for gem, conq is uncapped now
[0:11:17] jeffrey_ghostdive: got gorehowl recently for mog from vault. was very pleased
[0:11:51] heldtheline: Kira knows she has a captive audience
[0:12:31] Zuldak: youre so lucky you dont have to dread whats coming monday... the return of the rocket
[0:13:15] Gih_87: I guess it's first time I see ms Kira where she is now
[0:13:36] wackpoetic: BG Blitz daily win is good for farming conq, kinda fun if you havent done it yet
[0:13:55] Hippwn: This was my first time getting a vicious mount thanks to you
[0:14:07] cupcakechaos013: baby just went down for a nap, the urge to dive back into baldurs gate 3 is strong nut that would require getting off the couch haha
[0:14:15] jgbrit: You mean you're not pushing for Glad? Shame on you 😂
[0:15:06] jeffrey_ghostdive: i wish the blue dk tier appearance wasn't the pvp one.  i don't really do pvp and it's nice for frost but i suppose i could get enough conquest
[0:15:56] diarrhea_lad: diarrhea_lad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Happy almost-February!
[0:15:56] Streamlabs: diarrhea_lad just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:16:00] jeffrey_ghostdive: i'll be happy for garrosh heirlooms maybe
[0:16:21] Zuldak: the black harvest order hall is... interesting.
[0:16:33] TotallyNotRaien: i didnt need the existencial crisis
[0:16:38] goplacidly56: he looks so cute lol
[0:16:41] TotallyNotRaien: but i love that hair on you
[0:16:49] wolfcloudchaser80: This foreground-Kira setup is so amusing. I'm just sitting here chuckling.
[0:17:01] gordastico: lmao
[0:17:06] Kurama__95: You had a human warlock before the great purge that could've done it iirc
[0:17:09] anker_jym: Gotta go down to the sewers, Hazel
[0:17:26] diarrhea_lad: i always get a chuckle that your imp's name is the same as my imp's name
[0:17:47] jgbrit: Has Anthus' quest taken a back seat? 🤔 I love love Suramar, if I could do it for you i would lol
[0:18:37] jeffrey_ghostdive: is warlock difficult at all to understand? been thinking about it
[0:18:49] jgbrit: Oh I must have missed the stream? Strange, I normally catch up on the vods
[0:19:32] GreenArrowed: @jeffreyighostdivei personally think destro lock is the easiest rotation in the game. the other two specs are a little plate spinny.
[0:19:36] heldtheline: I think that destro is pretty easy to understand, demo isn't much harder, there are just more buttons I feel like.
[0:19:36] jgbrit: Ahh, bonus stream 🥳
[0:19:37] Zuldak: It always seems kinda silly that moments after youre introduced to the council, their ritual goes wrong and most die. Not a strong first impression for locks.
[0:19:54] WhippWhapp: Happy it's *Anything-Can-Happen* day! o/
[0:20:03] GreenArrowed: yea, that's how i become the netherlord
[0:20:09] Zuldak: warlocks are actually goblins confirmed
[0:20:11] GreenArrowed: bc the dummies all died
[0:20:20] wolfcloudchaser80: @jeffreyighostdivei You have the option to use a rotation helper like Hekili to act as training wheels until you get the hang of it.
[0:20:32] Zuldak: use your racial: escape artist!
[0:20:50] Hippwn: that pet is big enough to be a gnome mount
[0:20:58] jgbrit: Technically you're not a free boy!
[0:21:14] cashthb: hard lock, rip boy, you will be missed
[0:21:42] white_catz: omg what is that outfit lol its prolly from the shop right
[0:22:07] white_catz: thanks for the answer
[0:22:22] white_catz: any onesie would be cute
[0:22:46] jgbrit: Damn, I was in LA in 19, I should have gone for the wendigo woolies
[0:22:51] Ryok: dig is about to start zeldaEyes
[0:23:02] white_catz: oo right there are some pink mounts coming this month lol
[0:23:03] neimoose2: good morning all you beautiful people!!
[0:23:05] gordastico: 2019? dont you mean a couple months ago? LUL
[0:23:10] sence_00: they said they would be posting it all'
[0:23:15] Zuldak: hopefully the guy who did the post wasn't let go during the great MS purge
[0:23:16] anker_jym: Can't wait to see if the airships from Blizzcon '17 get enabled for Dragonriding lol
[0:23:45] Ryok: hmm.. i think i saw what was coming up on trading post and i didn't want anything merodyHmm but i don't think we got an official post
[0:23:48] cashthb: I want a big watch mount
[0:24:14] cashthb: or, just give an other watch with a slightly different tint of blue
[0:24:15] goplacidly56: I cant remember if I did this on my lock lol
[0:24:29] white_catz: btw is there a way to get s2 armor to turn it into aberrus tier pieces? i thinik theyve turned everything (like timerifts,dreamsurge etc) into s3 right?
[0:24:29] Zuldak: i am hoping there is no moutn on the post next month so i wont feel compelled to buy and i can save some
[0:24:44] NinjAnola: Omgerd how long have I been away
[0:24:45] Ujai321: so... you tell us what you want, what you really really want?
[0:25:00] Ujai321: !wig
[0:25:01] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:25:01] goplacidly56: lol
[0:25:06] jeffrey_ghostdive: still haven't checked archives out. how is it?
[0:25:08] NinjAnola: Your hair is so pretty. Last time it was short. I need to twitch more
[0:25:21] wolfcloudchaser80: @cashthb Oh man, a mount with visible clockwork parts? Didn't know I wanted that until just now. Maybe Bronze Flight themed.
[0:25:25] cashthb: I think so
[0:25:46] atlietv: can anyone else not log into wow rn
[0:25:57] NinjAnola: Are you eu or na
[0:26:01] Zuldak: i did see SSF was added to the classic PTR
[0:26:04] jgbrit: I saved so much tender last month, I didn't want barely anything
[0:26:06] atlietv: na
[0:26:30] averageteacup: @Zuldak what's SSF? :D
[0:26:46] Zuldak: SSF = solo self found. Basically you play wow without playing with anyone
[0:26:47] NinjAnola: @atlietv is it giving you an error or just not connecting
[0:26:48] jeffrey_ghostdive: those robes are nice
[0:26:51] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:26:51] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:26:51] jeffrey_ghostdive: i got them too
[0:27:08] averageteacup: @Zuldak ooh, thank you, that is nice
[0:27:13] Mistyshade79: @HazelNuttyGames I once saw a stream where you were using a talent that looked like a shadowy dome shooting out from your character and it was killing enemies would you happen to remember what class and talent that was?
[0:27:36] marvin1995xo: did your hair allready grow that long again ? wasnt here for a little while ??
[0:27:47] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:27:48] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:27:49] jeffrey_ghostdive: i definitely didn't grab the pterrordax for this month
[0:27:56] jeffrey_ghostdive: even if there isn't a february mount
[0:27:57] anker_jym: The RNG gods truly blessed my Amirdrassil run last night. Between tier drops and catalyzing other drops, I went from 0 piece to 4 piece on my Feral Druid. Which means I won't be getting any rare mount drops until 2030 at least lol
[0:28:02] jeffrey_ghostdive: pterrordaxes are ehh
[0:28:08] wolfcloudchaser80: Was it Halo?
[0:28:09] gordastico: read anything good lately?
[0:29:09] Mistyshade79: @HazelNuttyGames no it actually looked like a dome shooting out from your character but now that I have the class I should be able to find the talent. Thanks
[0:29:17] jeffrey_ghostdive: haven't been able to get a leg piece to turn into tier for the life of me
[0:29:25] jeffrey_ghostdive: always get a cloak from the dream stuff
[0:29:31] sence_00: Anti Magic Zone?
[0:29:39] wolfcloudchaser80: There's Holy Nova, but it's gold colored
[0:29:50] eielwind: my guild now has 4 alts with the legendary but only one main, people are DISPLEASED
[0:30:03] Mistyshade79: lol I see that someone has her Purrfect co-host on stream today
[0:30:09] white_catz: oh yea i actually timed my first 20's last week, ad, dht and wm
[0:30:13] Ujai321: it couldnt have been a mage with arcane explosion, as hazel doesnt play mages
[0:30:18] averageteacup: the music of this zone is so beautiful
[0:30:33] brazkat: i got leggo last week on main
[0:30:33] macydoes_: cute transmog 🤍
[0:30:41] brazkat: who i am thinking of rerolling off of
[0:30:57] Ujai321: raid still going strong for you guys?
[0:31:08] white_catz: so inksy is ur main now? did u give up the evo completely?
[0:31:21] conksalot: Do you actually like the people you raid with? I feel stuck with my group because the time works for me and I'm not sure it's worth it.
[0:31:48] eielwind: are you doing the skip at least
[0:31:54] eielwind: gotcha
[0:31:59] gordastico: is the dracthyr legendary still worth getting?
[0:32:18] eielwind: I’m sure you feel a WAY about legendaries now lol
[0:32:33] cashthb: i can't wait to get my legendary just to swap it for a world drop green next season
[0:32:38] Zuldak: idk i think it would be nice to have a legendary drop in the emerald dream. As a druid I wouldn't know of anything legendary in the emerald dream
[0:32:40] cashthb: *just in time to
[0:32:42] Ryok: @gordastico we don't know yet D: if they do season 4 like they did in shadowlands there will be an item to upgrade the legendaries to current season ilvl
[0:32:54] BoogiePonderosa: we downed Tindral  on Heroic last night.. so i'm going to need that Fyrakk guide really soon!  ;)
[0:32:56] Ryok: @gordastico but they haven't confirmed or denied anything yet
[0:33:01] Ujai321: it mattered to you, and that's all that matters
[0:33:10] white_catz: i remember u saying u missed the gnome haha i stopped watching streams altogether while ago but im up to date on ur yt vids
[0:33:54] jeffrey_ghostdive: at the start, i was interested in the legendary for this patch but....ehhhh frost dk isn't fun to play right now
[0:34:00] GreenArrowed: palworld has been fun to watch. resisting the urge to play
[0:34:10] wolfcloudchaser80: Can speak for Enshrouded: I'm definitely enjoying it
[0:34:13] anker_jym: Speaking of which, any chance of a Baldur's Gate stream? Or did you do that last year?
[0:34:26] eielwind: I’m getting very deep in palworld now with breeding
[0:34:32] Ryok: @jeffreyighostdivei i really like frost but yeah the "stand in your dnd" playstyle sucks D:
[0:34:32] cashthb: sounds like a horrible place to be
[0:34:42] BoogiePonderosa: oo Cap'n Crackers!
[0:35:26] wolfcloudchaser80: Enshrouded is certainly a step up in challenge compared to Palworld
[0:35:31] jeffdmk: do you think pokemon will sue pal world?
[0:35:32] Ujai321: on a Stray to Valheim scale, where does Palworld land?
[0:35:38] Dezzdemona417: Dezzdemona417 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:35:38] Streamlabs: dezzdemona417 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:35:55] jeffrey_ghostdive: i'm really realizing the nightmarish amount of ore i need in Palworld at the moment
[0:36:24] Ryok: @jeffdmk if they could've they would've already before the game launched
[0:36:35] diarrhea_lad: @jeffdmk I doubt it, but I think there was a specific mod that added actual Pokemon models to the game that was send a C$D
[0:36:38] Ryok: their statement was basically "yes we know... shut up"
[0:36:49] cashthb: I had to learn some copyright law and in my half-professional opinion: no one cares, nintedo smells
[0:36:58] jeffdmk: @Ryok they could get much more money doing it this way
[0:37:18] Ujai321: and the best way to decide if you like something or not is, as anybody knows, mulling it over in your head forever
[0:37:23] Ryok: @diarrhea_lad yes because the person behind it locked the mod behind his patreon subscription... and you can't go and make money off of nintendo IPs
[0:37:30] Zuldak: I bought doom Eternal for halloween but didnt play. Finally got around to it and it was great
[0:37:49] GreenArrowed: i don't think you'd like to stream bg3 either way. the backseating is unbearable.
[0:38:24] eielwind: @greenarrowed you are so right
[0:38:28] Ryok: palworld is only 30$ last i heard merodyHmm
[0:38:29] cashthb: oh boy, not paying attention to the story of bg3 won't hurt the experience
[0:38:31] eielwind: BG3 is very expensive lol
[0:38:31] jeffrey_ghostdive: honestly, story aside exploring is fun in bg3
[0:38:35] jeffrey_ghostdive: its what ive done
[0:39:11] wolfcloudchaser80: I bet you'd like Subnautica over BG3. Subnautica has story, but it's kind of presented as you play instead of in cutscenes.
[0:39:15] eielwind: it’s nice palworld and enshrouded same price point
[0:39:20] eielwind: both total less than bg3 lol
[0:39:33] diarrhea_lad: "Escape the Jailer" man, if only
[0:39:34] BoogiePonderosa: looks sort of like the suit the kid wears in Where the WIld things Are
[0:39:43] Ujai321: very silly of the demons to emprison a warlock and guard it with a demon
[0:39:54] cashthb: you should play the witcher 3 instead, would fit the stream way more
[0:40:04] jeffrey_ghostdive: subnautica scares me
[0:40:10] jeffrey_ghostdive: but it was compelling
[0:40:12] Zuldak: idk, you could see if we feel that way via sub goal?
[0:40:21] Ujai321: i have had more games than desire to play games for a long time
[0:40:26] wolfcloudchaser80: You can collect cute fish pets and make an aquarium in Subnautica.
[0:40:44] Ryok: that's why i always just play the same games and watch streams on the side of games i'm interested in xD
[0:40:53] anker_jym: Fair point. That's why I can't get into other MMO'S
[0:40:55] tyrene: what backpack mog is she using
[0:41:00] sence_00: BG3 just feels like work to me, and the turn-based is soo slooow
[0:41:07] Zuldak: if we feel like we want variety gaming :P
[0:41:14] cashthb: people smell tho, games doesn't
[0:41:21] jeffrey_ghostdive: I feel similar. I have a hard time pushing to try new games. if it's gifted to me, I will give it a good shot
[0:41:29] Zuldak: the Hazel dictatorship
[0:41:30] GreenArrowed: hazel does hazel, we'll be here
[0:41:41] tyrene: thanks
[0:41:41] cashthb: but what if you want to play monkey island?
[0:41:42] kassia_lind: I have a lot of anxiety, so I find it much easier to stick to the games I know. I rarely branch out to other games and if I do, they’re usually new entries to series I already love. So I get it! it’s hard to branch out
[0:41:44] eielwind: palworld is the first game I’ve stuck with hard in awhule
[0:41:46] jeffdmk: are you going to do the time rifts on boy to get the warlock only drop?
[0:42:10] jgbrit: That's what I genuinely love about your stream Hazel, I know what to expect.
[0:42:24] BoogiePonderosa: awww.  hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[0:42:27] Ujai321: gesundheit x20, kira
[0:42:34] BoogiePonderosa: kitty sneezes!
[0:42:39] UltraDankNooner: @HazelNuttyGames have you done the part where u need 3 other warlocks to summon a demon, if not i can help im stuck on that part
[0:42:43] Zuldak: does the timerift drop a demon apperence @jeffdmk ?
[0:42:44] sence_00: theres a warlock only thing from time rift>
[0:42:48] sence_00: ?
[0:42:52] UltraDankNooner: order hall quest line
[0:42:59] jeffrey_ghostdive: no problems finding ore in Palworld, the issue comes with your carry weight
[0:43:00] jeffdmk: @Zuldak it does
[0:43:43] Ujai321: are cat pets good at carrying things, or was it just what you had?
[0:44:01] eielwind: thats what i did with 2nd base but keeping up with both gets trickty
[0:44:10] eielwind: and then a third base for breeding thats still a WIP
[0:44:21] jeffrey_ghostdive: oh yeah, nice
[0:44:32] diarrhea_lad: When you think about it Garrisons was just Palworld with WoW Characters
[0:44:33] brazkat: how long does order halls usually take?
[0:44:37] jeffrey_ghostdive: smug pink cat
[0:44:38] iheb_lock: wait when did you grow so much hair
[0:44:42] wolfcloudchaser80: And they stack, apparently. So... 5 cats.
[0:44:49] diarrhea_lad: !wig
[0:44:49] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:45:06] BoogiePonderosa: is it bigger than a bread box?...
[0:45:15] anker_jym: Does Palworld encourage you to be the very best, like no one ever was?
[0:45:17] brazkat: i needa do all but 1 order hall still
[0:45:36] Zuldak: i like the little demon friend dude here
[0:45:45] BoogiePonderosa: what place is this?
[0:45:58] Ujai321: one might argue Palworlds makes you strive to be the very worst
[0:46:11] BoogiePonderosa: oh!
[0:46:15] BoogiePonderosa: no wonder i never saw it
[0:46:19] jeffdmk: cute until he tries to catch it with his teeth
[0:46:19] diarrhea_lad: yes it does
[0:46:26] BoogiePonderosa: looks pretty amazing
[0:46:28] drewetling: it is the loc hall
[0:47:09] anker_jym: Scepter of Sargeras had the best questline
[0:47:14] Kurama__95: You can use the scroll from the quest
[0:47:33] sence_00: oh no!!
[0:48:26] BoogiePonderosa: :(
[0:48:52] eielwind: my dog has done that before and also never figured out what happened
[0:48:53] Octopixy1971: ahwww
[0:49:08] sence_00: maybe a little thorn or something?
[0:49:09] Zuldak: maybe he has bad gas?
[0:49:47] Ujai321: hope he is ok now
[0:49:48] Octopixy1971: ahww the poor guy <3
[0:50:05] Ujai321: also, oof at that VERY late night
[0:50:30] BoogiePonderosa: hazelYikes
[0:51:02] wolfcloudchaser80: It's so frustrating that we can't communicate to find out what hurts.
[0:51:27] sence_00: its so tough to know what they are going through :(
[0:51:33] vanillakush1: my god ur hair grows fast

[1:00:53] Ujai321: so, on a Stray to Valheim scale, where does Palworld land?
[1:00:53] sence_00: emergency vet is a scary trip for sure, thankful i havent had to go yet

[1:03:26] elliongrey: If you get the season 3 achievement for completing the heroic raid, can you use the tier piece item that you get towards the PVP Variant?
[1:03:28] Vesamora: So I am a giga noob when it comes to pet battling. Is there a reliable source for scripts? I'm looking at Xufu but they don't have any for the Outland tamers
[1:03:41] ibubblebear: igot lucky the same way @sence_00 dont ate a frog but the vet was like they already got it out there system and there isnt any poisonous frogs in the area so she will be fine

[1:32:54] wolfcloudchaser80: I remember playing Team Fortress Classic and having to ask what "lol" meant.
[1:33:05] kryptogurl: how long have you played wow for
[1:33:19] gordastico: best I can do when I type 'lol' is exhale loudly from my nostrils
[1:33:26] scootmage: I still call them "emotes"
[1:33:37] Zuldak: the boomer emoji is when you have like 10 smilies in a row...
[1:33:38] rubibeya: My aunt would send messages with lol at the end but ment lots of love. Kept thinking she was joking. Had to ask what lol ment to her.

[1:35:11] aGhastGaming: I felt so old when my niece saw me typing ":D" and she said "why are you making up new emojis?"
[1:35:17] wolfcloudchaser80: I can't help but interpret emojis as "putting stickers on your message." If someone did that on paper, it would be absurdly childish and I can't get past that.
[1:35:20] anker_jym: Someone with more power than me needs to link the old ROFLMAO Oxhorn machinima
[1:35:27] Ryok: @Perkolate @msmester1 thanks, guess i'm checking the vod later ^^

[1:36:31] msmester1: last time i wrote a letter i arrived earlier than the letter...
[1:36:45] Zuldak: being able to make a call is an unfortunate feature of modern smart phones
[1:36:59] scootmage: I have it set to only ring for my immediate family.
[1:36:59] gordastico: what if its like a family emergency?
[1:37:08] wolfcloudchaser80: You only answer the phone immediately when someone might give you a dog.
[1:37:18] IAmScarlett__: im that socially anxious i wont even call my family
[1:37:20] msmester1: i was so bad with phone calls but now its part of my job so i got used to it

[1:39:28] goplacidly56: Did you get those blue glasses from fishing in Gilneas?
[1:39:29] aGhastGaming: send to 10 people or you go to heck tomorrow
[1:39:38] jeffdmk: what if your mom gets arrested and calls you with her phone and you dont answer so she has to spend the night in jail?
[1:39:47] Zuldak: i remember the days of AIM, yahoo messanger and msn
[1:39:56] gordastico: something about a dead girl coming back to haunt you iirc
[1:40:07] cashthb: what if moose gets arrested?
[1:40:07] aGhastGaming: nothing beats the old "You've got mail"
[1:40:10] diarrhea_lad: @aGhastGaming or worse, OHIO.
[1:40:11] kryptogurl: loved MSN
[1:40:19] Zuldak: i remember flirting with hs gf over aim and sending something and then waiting for a response
[1:40:46] AngryInternetCat: What if the president calls and tells you he will fire nukes if you dont say "awooga" in ten minutes?
[1:40:47] Abrupt_Winter: How many attempts did it take to get invincible to drop? in the last 2 weeks I got midnight, sha of anger mount, and kor kron juggernaut, just waiting on that damn horse
[1:41:05] AngryInternetCat: Obvs joking xD
[1:41:12] tempestmellinger1901: hi hazle and chat
[1:41:14] diarrhea_lad: MSN was how me and my college GF kept in touch when either one of us was home from campus
[1:41:16] aGhastGaming: I wonder if kids still pass notes, prolly just msg
[1:41:17] sence_00: my parents old dog went to doggy jail so many times (escaping te yard) they had to start sending friends to pick him up
[1:41:26] jeffdmk: some of actually had a life Kappa
[1:41:29] Nevir_DK: Hello
[1:41:43] Zuldak: this was before myspace... man the internet was wild back then. I remember kazaa and limewire nights lol
[1:41:45] gordastico: web 2.0 was something
[1:41:48] cashthb: I remember the poke feature on msn. I used to spam it to trigger one of my friend whiley we were playing againts each other
[1:41:49] tempestmellinger1901: how's everyone's day
[1:41:54] Zuldak: pre DCMA
[1:41:56] aGhastGaming: I had so many notes read in front of the class lol
[1:41:57] gordastico: I kinda miss some of it tbh
[1:42:22] Zuldak: reading private notes in front of the class is emotional trauma
[1:42:37] aGhastGaming: @Zuldak yuuuup lmao
[1:42:58] Zuldak: i miss older tech when it felt like something huge and new was always coming out and it was exciting
[1:43:07] kryptogurl: i'm glad i grew up in the generation without social media .
[1:43:08] Ryok: @Zuldak it's straight up bullying D:
[1:43:11] jeffdmk: I miss when search was actually good. There actually is a recent study that basically all search is getting worse.
[1:43:13] gordastico: yea and that social media platforms were going to become beacons of freedom of speech and what not. mostly with twitter
[1:43:13] unendingstrife: i remember my parents used to get disks in the mail that had 100 hrs of aol internet on it
[1:43:39] Zuldak: Pentium processors came out... but here are pentium 2's!
[1:43:55] diarrhea_lad: I remember the day my brother brought home our Windows XP computer and was blown away by how "modern" it looked
[1:43:57] cashthb: now things are getting more expensive pretty quickly! bigger number = better number
[1:44:20] wolfcloudchaser80: I was one of those lucky people with the floating point error on the pentium
[1:44:27] diarrhea_lad: I miss Space Cadet Pinball
[1:44:32] scootmage: I used a CRT in 2008...
[1:44:35] Ryok: @unendingstrife i was the poor kid that had to deliver those around here... because for some reason every 2 or 3 months there was an extra order on top of the normal papers i delivered D: it was the worst... that's why i only did that job for like 9 months
[1:44:37] goplacidly56: I remember dial up lol
[1:44:42] aGhastGaming: the days of talking to a friend on AIM and you're mom picks up the landline mid-conversation so you couldn't type back
[1:45:00] Arabany: Is it an aritfact weapon quest line?
[1:45:02] gordastico: i remember prince of persia having sounds even if you didnt have speakers LUL
[1:45:07] jeffdmk: how well can you do at making the old modem sound?
[1:45:12] Zuldak: I remember landlines where you could pick up another phone and listen in
[1:45:33] scootmage: did the internet used to be more fun or am I just old now?
[1:45:38] diarrhea_lad: it is
[1:45:48] Zuldak: @scootmage it was different. It was more toxic
[1:45:54] diarrhea_lad: I think both, honestly
[1:46:12] gordastico: @scootmage internet is no longer a frontier, its just kinda there like tv was back in the day
[1:46:19] Arabany: One day I hope to do every class specific questline, but I always end up with paladins:)
[1:46:20] 6sixthousand6: Back in my internet day you had to earn your porn
[1:46:24] averageteacup: People were way more optimistic
[1:46:32] 6sixthousand6: these days theyre just giving away that porn for free
[1:46:47] Ryok: i recently heard of a friend whose sister tried to wash her clothes in the dishwasher... i'm glad i did not grew up in todays days
[1:46:48] kryptogurl: the class order halls are soo long for each class, i've only done druid so far
[1:46:58] heldtheline: I remember way back when that we actually used our real names because what was privacy.
[1:47:00] everquest101: i think u lettin nolstalgia hit you hard, for example   when M launched windows vista and it did not worked with wow  u dont remember hate on  forums
[1:47:03] Ryok: from* not of a friend D:
[1:47:28] aGhastGaming: tldr, we are all old
[1:47:43] InwardXenon: @ryok I watched a show where someone tried cooking a lasagna in a dishwasher...
[1:47:48] scootmage: I feel like people are starting to shift away from social media, maybe its just me.
[1:47:50] wolfcloudchaser80: I've heard more and more stories of young people being baffled by mice and keyboards these days. Touchscreens is all they know.
[1:48:17] MaddiDJ4: token gen z WoW player
[1:48:18] diarrhea_lad: @scootmage Nah, I think the implosion of the Bird app really accelerated that
[1:48:25] anker_jym: I was pretty deep in the Forums up until the end of Shadowlands. When I quit the Forums, I started enjoying the game more. Fancy that lol
[1:48:36] AngryInternetCat: Dishwasher salmon is a semi famous meme
[1:49:00] diarrhea_lad: Does anyone remember Doodlegnome from the forums?
[1:49:04] RedShamrock11: It's da BOY!
[1:49:09] everquest101: when u show ur granddaugthr a old vhs tape and she ask you what is that then u realize ua re old as hell
[1:49:13] scootmage: I got rid of facebook about a decade ago. I used to close it and then open it right back up :/
[1:49:15] gordastico: the older I get the more I crave old fashioned comunication
[1:49:17] cashthb: the biggest issue with social media is the way people use it, or how it's moderated
[1:49:34] RedShamrock11: Whatcha workin on Hazel? Happy Wed
[1:49:47] heldtheline: I never go to GD on the forums; my realm forum is mostly cool and that's enough for me.
[1:50:10] RedShamrock11: ooo nice :) I was working on balance of power stuff on my druid yesterday
[1:50:12] scootmage: Bland question! Are you excited for the new expansion?
[1:50:57] Ryok: i used the official forums when i started the game, eventually i switched to mmo champion forums... mostly for free signatures and profile pics xD and once to ask why my guild is so stupid that we wiped 500+ times on the train boss in WoD D:
[1:51:23] scootmage: have you talked about the aotc mount being released for trader tender?
[1:51:32] kryptogurl: i'm still catching up with legion, shadowlands and dragofnflight. i started playing again last yr.
[1:51:39] Terra___l: @cashthb but it is so easy to deal with that problem just ad ID registering and then when someone sends a deaththread gets perm banned on that platform
[1:51:44] diarrhea_lad: I think I'm a little less excited this time around because I know one of my best friends (and the one to get me into WoW) is pretty much done with the game
[1:51:59] Zuldak: i think the aotc mounts should be tied to time walking
[1:52:04] Dezzdemona417: I'm with you on that one. They were testing the waters.
[1:52:09] aGhastGaming: that would defeat the whole purpose of aotc lol
[1:52:48] Ryok: i just got GMOD PogChamp
[1:53:00] cashthb: @JustIAron for what? flexing?
[1:53:05] itsparvati: the whole pvp section of achievements just doesn't exist for me LOL
[1:53:09] gordastico: I collect toys in wow and I had to let go of the gladiator's sanctum banner from WOD :(
[1:53:10] scootmage: I think rare and exclusive things are impressive and give players something to strive for. It adds to the charm.
[1:53:12] fruitywhirls: i'm not a fan of fotm items, even though I have most of them i'd be fine if they let others have it in some other way
[1:53:31] kryptogurl: are AOTC mounts ones you get for beating the current raids?
[1:53:33] AngryInternetCat: Garry's Mod?
[1:53:38] Ryok: it's a pretty easy farm on lfr, some classes can even burst jaina down before she teleports away from the ship and save a lot of time ^^
[1:53:51] Ryok: @kryptogurl yes hc endboss while it's current
[1:53:59] kryptogurl: ah thank you
[1:54:01] fruitywhirls: sorry i said fotm but i meant fomo
[1:54:12] diarrhea_lad: I'm a little torn. Like, I would love it if the Mage Tower weapon mogs were still available. They already have the tech to make Mage Tower still challenging
[1:54:16] Ryok: yes easily soloable even on a ~430 ilvl
[1:54:20] cashthb: btw, I dislike the way we are calling them "fomo" mounts, they are "prestige" mounts
[1:54:24] aGhastGaming: I wish I had gotten the moose aotc mount, only one I am missing
[1:55:08] scootmage: I think blizzard set a value in the past by saying "this is your only chance" so idk that they should undercut that. I am open to the argument though.
[1:55:18] IAmScarlett__: why did u need to kill that nightborne
[1:55:20] cashthb: wrong spec I assume
[1:55:23] Ryok: i really wish they would bring back the wrath naxx meta protodrakes... it's BS that they were the only mounts ever removed from a meta achievement D:
[1:55:30] sence_00: the Slime Cat in SL S4 was a little like that, I wonder if theyll do that again
[1:55:53] InsomniaNervosa: Ohhh. it's a gnome. I was like confused for a moment, haha
[1:56:24] Terra___l: i want the dreanor challenge dungeons weapons
[1:56:24] InsomniaNervosa: I was legit like, what, new yeti class? :O
[1:56:31] gordastico: you're playing a gnome? I thought it was a yeti runt!
[1:56:58] InsomniaNervosa: er, not class, race.
[1:57:07] InsomniaNervosa: Still waking up here, it seems, haha
[1:57:10] aGhastGaming: the best boy
[1:57:27] IAmScarlett__: IAmScarlett__ watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! also i forgot about this!
[1:57:52] scootmage: I need to do that too...
[1:58:01] IAmScarlett__: ive been here for 7 streams in a row
[1:58:04] IAmScarlett__: are you proud
[1:58:27] InsomniaNervosa: I'm finally around when you're streaming!
[1:59:00] Kinraeel: your valdrakken seems empty compared to mine haha, no matter what time mine is always so busy, it gets annoying sometimes haha
[1:59:04] gordastico: I always go for a walk when I feel like that
[1:59:19] ossiary: heyyy
[1:59:21] scootmage: I pushed too hard at the gym yesterday and woke up filled with regret - and now advil!
[1:59:40] InsomniaNervosa: Have you already done your timewalking stuff?
[2:00:09] ossiary: how are you
[2:00:13] InsomniaNervosa: The weekly quest
[2:00:18] Tofterid: pet?
[2:00:22] supashanka: well we know what spot you didn't have on the airship in icecrown lol
[2:00:49] InsomniaNervosa: Ohhh, that's fair! I'm trying to get back into that too.
[2:00:50] goplacidly56: lol
[2:00:55] Voldreka: Whoa, you grow hair real fast @HazelNuttyGames
[2:01:12] Perkolate: !wig
[2:01:12] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:01:50] IAmScarlett__: how good are suffusion camps for gearing?
[2:02:14] anker_jym: Thanks for the reminder that I should do the Timewalking weekly on my alt
[2:02:17] gordastico: I choose to believe hazel has hair growth superpowers
[2:02:34] kenyyHY: Hazel HI
[2:02:49] gordastico: A SKINWALKER
[2:02:54] IAmScarlett__: or just do the 10.2 campaign and world quests
[2:02:56] InsomniaNervosa: lIf you need anyone to queue with @saviorofazeroth let me know!
[2:03:06] AngryInternetCat: Changeling!
[2:03:09] heldtheline: animagus, from harry potter?
[2:03:35] Ryok: funny hair growth superpowers are coming up because i started reading the first harry potter book and apparently his hair would grow back even though his aunt shaved almost all of it off xD
[2:03:52] gordastico: if I could pick a cryptid to turn into I would choose a south american gnome
[2:04:21] anker_jym: @insomnianervosa thank you!!
[2:04:23] 6sixthousand6: Sasquatch is the sexiest cryptid
[2:04:27] 6sixthousand6: agree
[2:04:29] BoogiePonderosa: "samsquantch!"
[2:04:35] AnarchyMoose: AnarchyMoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 40 months? is it time for a midlife crisis? time for me to move to Miami or something
[2:04:35] Streamlabs: anarchymoose just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:04:36] cashthb: what about the man-bear-pig?
[2:04:38] heldtheline: Mothman is cool. He has a statue
[2:04:39] Ryok: funny story about the HP books... i visited a 2nd hand shop and got 4 of the books for 2€ each, so i went on a 2nd hand website and ordered what i thought was the missing books... turns out they're all different sizes and the one that for some reason cost 12€... was the audio book girldmSad
[2:04:43] gordastico: mothman is also kinda cool
[2:04:54] kenyyHY: theres alot of sasquaches
[2:05:06] MaddiDJ4: went down to Tennessee this past summer. grabbed my boyfriend some Bigfoot merch
[2:05:15] AnarchyMoose: go like volunteer in ghana for a year or something like that haha
[2:05:20] anker_jym: Hazel, did you ever go through a Hot Pockets or other freezer food phase?
[2:05:45] gordastico: the plurar of sasquach is sasquachi you cant convince me otherwise LUL
[2:05:57] MaddiDJ4: to answer the which cryptid do I want to be, is the abominable snowman a cryptid?
[2:06:05] BoogiePonderosa: i figured you'd make your own pizza dough!
[2:06:06] cashthb: a sports car is a really good investment, just go for exotics
[2:06:27] databob1: I prefer Shinto to Budisum
[2:06:29] AnarchyMoose: Hazel, did you ever go through a Hot Topic or other awesome fashion phase?
[2:06:31] anker_jym: Frozen pizza on raid night sounds like the dream!
[2:06:42] BoogiePonderosa: SeemsGood
[2:06:56] gordastico: do you make your pizza dough fluffy and tall or NY style?
[2:07:07] Ryok: i wish i could eat frozen pizza... but i absolutely HATE cheese
[2:07:09] Almadovar: I've been listening to Linkin park without knowing this whole stream and I gotta say I'm loving the vibe Hazel
[2:07:10] cashthb: just make your own mozzarella
[2:07:31] Ryok: and the only pizza without cheese (yes i include vegan cheese) is the pizza made out of chocolate D:
[2:08:05] gordastico: thin  dough mostly
[2:08:27] BoogiePonderosa: NY style is your typical style
[2:08:27] FranciscoTheMage: OMG OMG
[2:08:30] anker_jym: So how do you feel about stuffed crust?
[2:08:32] FranciscoTheMage: i love thin crust
[2:08:40] Briibuns: i love bread too much
[2:08:41] anker_jym: Same lol
[2:08:43] rushthehabit: how do you feel about cheesefilled crusts?
[2:08:48] FranciscoTheMage: have you tried cauliflower crust
[2:08:49] shaypressplay: I lived it Italy for 3 years so American Pizza for me now is spoiled
[2:08:51] fragaden: absolutely agree
[2:08:52] cashthb: if it's on a cracker it's really over baked
[2:09:11] MaddiDJ4: I quit my job at a pizza place not too long after they introduced thin crust to the menu. which wasn’t a reason why I quit, but it could’ve been
[2:09:13] Ryok: @shaypressplay italian pizza is just the absolute best
[2:09:17] Briibuns: surprisingly cauliflower pizza is pretty good
[2:09:26] dicemeister23: Speaking of homemade, how is your sourdough starter? What is her name again? Lindsey or Emily or Hailey or something like that?
[2:09:30] cashthb: have you tried nutella crust?
[2:09:31] shaypressplay: @Ryok It is!!!!!
[2:09:49] Octopixy1971: Exactly i am with you Hazel lol
[2:09:50] BoogiePonderosa: i have to eat gluten free.. and if you don't have to.. enjoy the gluten!
[2:09:51] rushthehabit: it pretends to be rice too :(
[2:09:57] supashanka: "you keep that abomination crust to yourself!"
[2:10:02] fruitywhirls: cauliflower is super expensive here ApuApustaja
[2:12:13] anker_jym: @boogieponderosa I'm not gluten free, but I've found that the gluten free versions of some things taste better to me than the originals. There's a brand of Mac and Cheese I get that has a gluten free version that is superior to the regular
[2:13:47] tempestmellinger1901: I'm in dalaran
[2:13:51] MrDismemberTV: MrDismemberTV subscribed with Prime. 
[2:13:51] Streamlabs: mrdismembertv just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:14:02] BoogiePonderosa: @saviorofazeroth that i'd endorse! Gluten free breadcrumbs are crispier and there are other things as well that are pretty good. Other items.. not so much :D
[2:14:27] MrDismemberTV: Love the YT vids, glad to catch ya streaming.
[2:14:37] tempestmellinger1901: like above the serves
[2:15:59] anker_jym: Yes, you can mount in the regular order hall
[2:16:04] jeffrey_ghostdive: i've been feeling curious if the aspects play any part at all in the next expansions or if theyll just chill at the dragon isles now
[2:16:20] BoogiePonderosa: seems like it to me-- GF stuff tends to be less soft and doesn't absorb liquids as readily (but i've only been doing it for a couple of years so small sample size)
[2:16:41] Zuldak: my compnay's office building got foreclosed on by the bank so im working from home till we get a new office ready in may
[2:17:41] jeffrey_ghostdive: some characters die in books
[2:17:47] jeffrey_ghostdive: and never get mentioned again
[2:18:09] HalcyonBeing: Probably why Varian and Bolvar had "OBLITERATE" deaths.
[2:18:25] anker_jym: Resurrection in the lore is super rare. It rarely happens, Anduin was able to do it once and it was a huge deal
[2:18:26] HalcyonBeing: That said they did Voljin dirty. he just got stabbed
[2:18:32] jeffrey_ghostdive: remember the big red dragon guy at dragonblight
[2:18:39] Tofterid: someone dont die in books and get mentioned by some1 in red shirt
[2:18:42] anduinwindrunner: hi hazel&chat how y'all doing <3
[2:18:52] cashthb: idk, they are out in the open and I'm pretty shy
[2:19:03] jeffrey_ghostdive: Korialstrasz i think his name was
[2:19:09] jeffrey_ghostdive: Alexstrasza's consort
[2:19:24] anduinwindrunner: ooo, warlock one is my fav! I'm doing good, few blueprints away from mechagon meta achievement (which is perfect for my gnome! :D )
[2:19:30] anker_jym: Idk, the whole death thing feels kinda cheapened after the whole expansion of finding out what happens after death.
[2:19:31] Dezzdemona417: I bought the packbeast mount from them today.
[2:19:42] cashthb: @jeffreyighostdivei that's 100% mentioned
[2:19:58] cashthb: ok, make it 99
[2:20:07] Dunedain1305: Hey Hazel! How are you? Hey everyone!
[2:20:14] wolfcloudchaser80: That's a first, someone is advertising H-Amirdrassil runs for gold on my sever and they're actually publicly stating the price.
[2:20:58] jeffrey_ghostdive: @cashthb in dragonflight?
[2:21:13] Neltalie: Hi hazel and chat, happy wednesday :D
[2:21:44] cashthb: he died before cata, most players never heard about him, why would they make him a plot point?
[2:22:05] ghostie1995: @wolfcloudchaser80 that’s common on moonguard us and some others I’ve seen
[2:22:14] Neltalie: i recently switched to wotlk to play with my bf, so weird to not have vault or trading post to think about
[2:22:31] anduinwindrunner: boy would be very cute on snowstorm hehe :D
[2:22:33] jeffrey_ghostdive: have you noticed some mounts make the camera go lower
[2:22:37] cashthb: boy might be a big slick boy
[2:22:40] jeffrey_ghostdive: like try getting on the blue proto
[2:22:49] padakins: weirdflex :)
[2:23:06] jeffrey_ghostdive: err, maybe any
[2:23:09] wolfcloudchaser80: @ghostie1995 New to Whisperwind-US. And to be honest, I thought it would be more expensive than 120-250k
[2:23:19] Kalthael: Kalthael subscribed with Prime. 
[2:23:19] Streamlabs: kalthael just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:23:23] Neltalie: they are so cute
[2:23:35] jeffrey_ghostdive: but yea, like if you go in the air with the blue proto or similar, the camera goes way low
[2:23:38] sence_00: the protoform stuff seems good for draenei?
[2:24:09] Zuldak: i get awful flashbacks to the fury warrior challenge seeing the imp mother
[2:24:20] ghostie1995: @wolfcloudchaser80 oh wow that’s cheap. they’re selling it for 350k -450k gold on mine
[2:25:05] Curufin_: you got a team for tournament realm?
[2:25:09] The_FinnMint: Hi Hazel! Howre you today! Just finished streaming myself! Had such a blast! Hows the collecting going?!
[2:25:09] FranciscoTheMage: is the new digg stuff weekly or daily digs
[2:25:13] Zuldak: yeah you did it as fire and used the time dial thingy thats super confusing to me
[2:25:20] ghostie1995: are you playing alliance or horde on whisperwind US?
[2:25:30] Ryok: @Zuldak weirdly enough that one was the 2nd easiest i've done xD only vengeance DH was easier
[2:26:04] ChappyAir: where do I get the quest?
[2:26:13] Ryok: @Zuldak to me ofc
[2:26:14] Zuldak: @Ryok worst was twins. second was healing
[2:26:15] Curufin_: lol it was, its just a +1 banner toy ^^
[2:26:28] ghostie1995: ohh sorry hazel I meant @wolfcloudchaser80
[2:27:00] Ryok: @Zuldak i spent... like 10 hours trying to do frostmage and gave up after i have a 1% wipe because the stalker idiot died, the main boss enraged and i didn't notice D:
[2:27:11] jeffrey_ghostdive: what would you think of garrosh heirloom reintroduction
[2:27:27] Ryok: @Zuldak i've not even attempted healing because it's the role i have by far the least experience in D:
[2:27:28] jeffrey_ghostdive: i think it's likely
[2:27:34] jeffrey_ghostdive: with that next patch
[2:27:55] sence_00: speaking of Garrosh - any theories around the Timerunning Pandamonium?
[2:27:58] jeffrey_ghostdive: yeah, i feel that
[2:28:19] The_FinnMint: @Ryok I did the healing tower with 470 ilvl and no talent changes/special trinks just fine, its easier than you think, i believe in you! <3
[2:28:22] jeffrey_ghostdive: i think it'll just be challenge modes and timewalking siege
[2:28:26] jeffrey_ghostdive: in my opinion
[2:28:54] anker_jym: Watch them not announce what the pirate patch is going to be, we just log in one day and find out lol
[2:29:02] jeffrey_ghostdive: mage tower confuses me. are you supposed to do it while in chromie time or any time?
[2:29:19] jeffrey_ghostdive: or is it easier in chromie time
[2:29:20] Zurestel77: @jeffreyighostdivei any time :)
[2:29:20] The_FinnMint: @jeffreyighostdivei any time works :)
[2:29:23] Zuldak: you have stream so you always have people to call on if you wanted. Mileage may very on how far you get
[2:30:11] jeffrey_ghostdive: all the textures will be the jolly roger for one day
[2:30:22] Zuldak: a lot of wow devs are posting pirate flags. they are up to something
[2:30:40] Zuldak: talk like a pirate day is in like... august?
[2:30:48] Stormcrone: I like that Henri the skunk hunter pet
[2:30:59] The_FinnMint: sea of thieves in wow
[2:31:01] anker_jym: All our characters will be drunk for the whole day
[2:31:02] The_FinnMint: confirmed.
[2:31:21] jeffrey_ghostdive: alliance vs horde ship battles
[2:31:34] MaddiDJ4: back in my day (legion) we found out about patches like the Sunday before they came out
[2:32:00] jeffrey_ghostdive: sounds like a pre patch thingy
[2:32:01] jeffrey_ghostdive: cool
[2:32:15] anker_jym: Invade by sea? I feel bad for the pirates who got assigned to Thunder Bluff lol
[2:32:19] jeffrey_ghostdive: they bring back the store pirate ship mount
[2:32:20] sence_00: ...bloodsail invades dragon isles?
[2:32:20] Stormcrone: how much can you drink and still get through a maze to win some pirate booty
[2:33:03] jeffrey_ghostdive: or a new pirate ship mount
[2:33:03] MaddiDJ4: Hazel has been begging for real boats since BFA lol
[2:33:16] KyleEverett: So excited for tomorrow. Gonna get everything pink
[2:33:44] Stormcrone: I was so disappointed we didn't get to keep the boat permanently from that Tanaris quest
[2:33:48] Stormcrone: yes, that one!
[2:33:53] cashthb: ac4 is prolly the closest thing you get
[2:34:10] fragaden: I wish we got a scarlet crusade where they became a pretty big threat. To where they have a giant floating castle/fortress
[2:34:11] Stormcrone: yeah, you can't use it where you'd really want to
[2:34:28] jeffrey_ghostdive: oop, gotta head out. see you all later. thanks for the chill stream
[2:34:35] Jokervenom1978: Good afternoon Hazel! teenHUG
[2:34:41] sence_00: isnt there a tuskarr boat you can get now
[2:34:45] HalcyonBeing: There's the river boat you get from the tuskarr though you can use anywhere, also the raft from nat pagel from mop @HazelNuttyGames
[2:35:16] fragaden: DJ followers
[2:35:23] InsomniaNervosa: Really wish they'd give us more customization options in general lol
[2:35:29] Stormcrone: building the boat, that's a great idea!
[2:35:33] cashthb: told ya ac4, it has all of those
[2:35:38] Curufin_: and then we end up with shipyard 2.0 from garrisons :'(
[2:36:06] Stormcrone: wait, what am I saying? the mekgnieer's chopper build was painful.
[2:36:14] thorstenlotta: Hey!!
[2:36:20] kieranashton1995: are you still posting vods to YouTube
[2:36:25] MaddiDJ4: @curufin_ shhhhh do not utter its name
[2:36:29] Zuldak: I played an assassins' creed game and im such a nerd that the historical inaccuracies bothered me
[2:36:53] HazelNuttyGames: !vods
[2:36:53] Streamlabs: you can watch full Hazel stream VoDs on YouTube! browse here https://www.youtube.com/@HazelNuttyVoDs
[2:36:57] cashthb: it's a really bad assassins creed game, it's a really good pirate game, but the good ol' ac stuff is very lackluster in it... also it requires you to log in uplay
[2:37:35] Ryok: i played AC2 really enjoyed it but that's about all i wanted from the series ^^' i doubt they ever added something that would make me go WOW glad i'm playing this xD
[2:37:36] Zuldak: oh man... yeah i hated that every company has their own login service. uplay, epic game, EA origin...
[2:37:39] SaraDivine: i just ran maw of souls for a quest and they added the motion sickness potion vendor man in the boat. wonder if they're doing that for all instances? or a sign..
[2:37:44] witchhobbit: i love them
[2:37:54] Stormcrone: I liked them better than LoTR movies
[2:37:58] Jokervenom1978: @Zuldak I feel you! I was a History major in college and that stuff bothers me too!
[2:38:08] witchhobbit: i just love the world so much
[2:38:13] raffle_nz: speaking of weird, have you seen the hobbit song from leonard nimoy?
[2:38:26] itsparvati: watching older movies FX is so funny
[2:38:32] anker_jym: I liked the Hobbit movies, but why the heck did they CGI the Orcs, what they did in LOTR worked so well!!
[2:38:35] witchhobbit: they just wanted to make 3 movies, that's all lol
[2:38:38] raffle_nz: can I post the link?
[2:38:47] Ryok: i read the LOTR books like 5 times... the movies suck xD
[2:38:48] Zuldak: visiting hobbiton in NZ was a lifetime goal. was so nice there
[2:38:53] m4gg00t: Hi Hazel  :)
[2:39:00] raffle_nz: ah, should be able to find it on youtube somewhere then
[2:39:12] witchhobbit: whaaat i love the movies and the books
[2:39:15] rocketnz: My wife used to live by Hobbiton
[2:39:22] Zuldak: i mean the hobit holes are there
[2:39:31] rocketnz: Matamata
[2:39:35] Zuldak: and so is the big tree at the top of the hill... sorta
[2:39:38] itsparvati: when i was a teen i wanted to be a beautiful elf, now im an adult and am ok with being a cool hobbit
[2:39:43] Stormcrone: me too. I never want to know the tricks behind the magic
[2:39:45] BoogiePonderosa: @Zuldak there's even a marathon in Hobbiton!
[2:39:56] Zuldak: i dont want to spoil the secret of that tree >.>
[2:40:01] witchhobbit: i mean books are always going to be better. film is never going to be just like a book
[2:40:05] cashthb: they really didn't "had" to do any changes, like what was the point of changing Bolg to Azog? they just changed stuff 'cause they thought they knew better
[2:40:29] phritss: You still don't?
[2:40:30] Jokervenom1978: I have huge Hobbit feet. tiriEyeroll
[2:40:49] anker_jym: Honestly, who didnt. Between Legolas and Will Turner, he was a huge heartthrob
[2:40:52] Ryok: @haleych the problem with them for me is #1 i don't like action movies #2 when they came out i was forced to sit at the dinner table until the end of the movie although we already finished eating 30 minutes into the movie D: they're good movies but me being a fan of the books and that trauma makes me dislike them ^^'
[2:40:55] Zuldak: you got a quest item from the dig?
[2:41:03] Curufin_: grown into a Gimli fan ;)
[2:41:09] phritss: I am just teasing you. :)
[2:41:17] BoogiePonderosa: He looked pretty good in a grizzled kind of way in Carnival Row
[2:41:37] Zuldak: The actor who played Saurmon actually met JRR Tolken in a bar
[2:41:44] fragaden: gran turisomo?
[2:41:55] Zuldak: Christopher Lee is like the most interesting man ever
[2:41:56] fragaden: gran turismo*
[2:42:09] Zuldak: yeah on accident he met him in a bar in london
[2:42:17] itsparvati: Lee's commentary for the LOTR box set is epic
[2:42:54] anker_jym: The DVD extras are as long as the movies lol
[2:42:57] Lune_Llune: Lune_Llune subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:42:57] Streamlabs: lune_llune just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:43:03] itsparvati: there is also commentary with all the hobbits and its very funny to listen to
[2:43:35] cashthb: you could watch painkiller it's really interesting :)
[2:43:36] delulu_4_u_boo: here we go
[2:43:46] delulu_4_u_boo: themus62CatClap
[2:43:51] TiPera: Hey there, which tattoo hurt the most?
[2:44:05] riffraff005: that documentary was amazing
[2:44:06] delulu_4_u_boo: need to watch that
[2:44:09] BoogiePonderosa: oh we're halfway thru Last Dance.. it's really good
[2:44:13] riffraff005: such a nostalgia trip
[2:44:18] anker_jym: I actually used to pick a movie to watch every Sunday afternoon, and some days those movies would be DVD extras for various movies
[2:44:24] cashthb: well painkiller might make you feel stuff
[2:44:42] BoogiePonderosa: LUL
[2:44:47] FranciscoTheMage: @HazelNuttyGames check out on HBO True Detective Night Country.. unfortunately its every sunday for new episodes
[2:44:59] Zuldak: Dennis Rodman was an enigma on that bull team
[2:45:20] Zuldak: bulls*
[2:46:01] BoogiePonderosa: these mods w/ sound alerts.. can you import your own audio?
[2:46:08] cashthb: btw what's the point of watching docus that doesn't make you paranoid or convinces you to watch infowars?
[2:47:10] witchhobbit: i have been preferring rewatching things i have already seen instead of new things (unless i'm really excited about it or its been recommended to me)
[2:48:10] BoogiePonderosa: Squatty de what?
[2:48:25] witchhobbit: i fidget too much and fidget toys have not helped. and i cant just draw or knit because focusing issues as well LUL
[2:48:26] sence_00: are there mana pots for Arena?
[2:48:45] sence_00: I know you cant use normal mana pots but, is drinking the only way to regain?
[2:49:15] anker_jym: Hazel, with streaming services become so big now, do you ever miss the days of old TV, where you would watch a new episode once a week on a specific channel with commercials and stuff
[2:51:04] nakedginger: HeyGuys
[2:51:07] kikisume: I get bored  after a while watching the awc but enjoy watching Hazel do pvp lol
[2:51:50] itsparvati: Tivo changed my life
[2:51:57] Ryok: i don't even watch streaming services ^^' twitch is all i need xD i guess i watched the new futurama season on disney+ but only because it's my favorite show ever
[2:51:58] witchhobbit: commercials were great for getting up for anything
[2:54:49] Ryok: @haleych but if you're watching something on a streaming service you can just pause D:
[2:55:18] Ryok: when i go afk while watching twitch i just put the stream on my tablet and take that with me xD
[2:58:09] Neverfade1030: Hi! Long time youtube follower just seen you show up on my recommended. Do you have anything to track team defensive CD's?
