[0:22:30] Bloodmatch: Saying its worse than season 1
[0:22:33] heavyharmonies: I've played D4 S3. It's better now post patch, but still not great seasonal mechanic.
[0:22:42] armenx3m: season launch patch was horrible, but they pushed a hotfix that adressed lots of issues so it's better, but still worse than previous season
[0:22:50] RalphMullin: I have been enjoying my experience in D4 however some of the complaints are valid but some complaints is BS
[0:22:58] Collnaris: i've seen tweets of people not liking it, but can't tell if because S3 or because d4
[0:23:03] Sprinklerz: Its based around traps that you should avoid and sometimes you have to wait for like 30s
[0:23:07] Bloodmatch: Darthmicrotransaction covered it

[0:23:48] Alastor7783: sick of those fucking side quests
[0:23:55] armenx3m: one of the core seasonal things are traps that hinder and slow down progress, which people hate in ARPGs and was already agressed with annoying objectives in dungeons on release and the seasonal companion progression was insanely slow and grindy while it being completely useless
[0:24:07] Alastor7783: I don't wanna see them
[0:24:09] Alastor7783: yeah
[0:24:12] jkos95: Good morning! Watching for the new mount :)

[0:24:46] Taylor131313: when the seasonal mechanic is something that slows you down, I can imagine it won't be well received by the community

[0:51:42] x_bairr_x: Of course that was in BC im not sure what would be best as far as the new game mechanics
[0:51:47] Mirkooo: @Taylor131313 name BrainRot
[0:51:47] Twigbot4k: Just in case you pvp.  It's more difficult to track a tiny target.
[0:51:57] Artresis_: @Artresis_ i pug yeah, sometimes i play with a premade tank awaree
[0:51:58] Collnaris: good lord those goggles
[0:52:21] Taylor131313: I don't think I've ever entered sunwell
[0:52:24] Basilwheat: most efficient is to buy it from the AH KEKW
[0:52:27] Morgonbladet: it's very linear?
[0:52:28] eielwind: clear all the trash up to first boss then reset
[0:52:29] littleofc1: yes for the mount
[0:52:29] nastye: sunwell viewer raid? POGGERS
[0:52:37] krutogaming: hello there :)
[0:52:40] skibbatv: According to WoWhead, for warlocks it's placing a portal in the 2nd courtyard and clearing all the mobs upstairs then porting down to reset
[0:52:42] Morgonbladet: Is Sunwell current content now?
[0:52:47] Tinybattery: If you want patterns, just run trash until first stairs and reset.
[0:52:53] xurnuxien: @skibbatv ModLove
[0:53:02] nastye: @Morgonbladet unfortunately, its even old in classic PepeHams
[0:53:02] skibbatv: Yeah from like Legion
[0:53:05] lighirr: I did the achi 4 days ago I got everything from AH
[0:53:09] Morgonbladet: You probably do everything before first boss then go back
[0:53:11] Collnaris: i still have to craft all those philosopher stones pepeW
[0:53:14] pikachups: How close to 100% are you?
[0:53:38] Morgonbladet: So people could farm this on the side for you
[0:53:42] Morgonbladet: chat ConcernFroge
[0:53:51] Collnaris: anniesKnight
[0:53:54] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: ooooo imagine sunwell reimagned as a mythic raid with new themed drops
[0:53:58] Taylor131313: anniesKnight
[0:54:05] illidari_Neeko: Hiya @anniefuchsia 💕
[0:54:07] krutogaming: yes
[0:54:08] Collnaris: shat
[0:54:09] eielwind: I did sunwell farming to sell the patterns and usually got at least 1 pattern per clear whether it was bop or boe
[0:54:09] nastye: shat > isle
[0:54:24] littleofc1: do u have all professions in wow?
[0:54:39] Artresis_: you can add one more point into the burning rush and
[0:55:06] xurnuxien: Kappa
[0:55:10] blobbster21: when does new dlc drop?
[0:55:21] nastye: what are these talents anniesYikes
[0:55:31] Artresis_: m+ build is wonky PepoG i suggest doing 2x points into the burning rush and removing the inquisitor eye so you have soul burn for the 70% HP heal it helps with farming NODDERS
[0:55:39] Taylor131313: blame kalamazi if incorrect @nastye
[0:55:48] nastye: i will blame kalamazi for that
[0:55:57] SNAKEBOMBS22: did you clear new raid on mythic?
[0:56:12] Taylor131313: soulburn healthstone I guess?
[0:56:14] Artresis_: if you do it and healthstone you get maX hp first and then heal for a lot
[0:56:19] Collnaris: i hope you remember tactics for m'uru
[0:56:26] Artresis_: it's 70% max HP heal so it helps a lot for farming with fel rush NODDERS
[0:56:41] Alastor7783: fel rush ? KEKW
[0:56:46] Artresis_: soulburn into healthstone yeah
[0:56:47] Alastor7783: soulburn + healthstone

[0:58:01] Twigbot4k: Check lockouts?
[0:58:02] Collnaris: you cleared this?
[0:58:03] nastye: pull everything, hide in corner and cast rain of fire is probably the most efficient way to do it
[0:58:04] skibbatv: @Sne4ky79 Heyge
[0:58:09] Geoffku: LULE

[4:20:09] Sne4ky79: @CriusSolari true but if they increase to $100 it has to be a joke if its only 20 hours and they say it should be completed during a weekend
[4:20:19] CriusSolari: @drzaius31 Loot boxes ruined more things
[4:20:37] Sne4ky79: aint buying $100 for that

[4:21:48] CriusSolari: @Sne4ky79 I'm fine with strat games having short rounds, Ie finish a Civ game in a day-20hrs... i mean 3-4 hours; but an RPG I want to be able to play until im done, then fool around with mods.
[4:22:03] bYTEfROG: @Geofke96 you can look at simplearmory for missing things, the mounts have a "mount planner" option. And wowhead has a "character planner" option
[4:22:37] Sne4ky79: @CriusSolari especially rpg
[4:22:39] CriusSolari: Theres a reason games with Mods survive so long; just wish they would do a #2, or #3 instead of going the way to The Sims series, N+1 expansions

[4:25:04] drzaius31: cheaper shorter games would be great
[4:26:15] CriusSolari: @drzaius31 Problem is Dev cycles, I'm sure AI could help with some of the time consuming parts, similar to how game engines changed game development; issue is exploiting AI so you can ignore the human aspect of game dev

[5:36:03] ayomus: mailbox right behind you toward portal
[5:36:06] JUTZE: What are the best solo classes to play?
[5:36:34] seamuscg: @JUTZE druid
[5:36:51] moa285: WutFace SHADOWLANDS WutFace
[5:36:52] Calli_C: I stopped leveling professions when I had to start going to some random table. It really killed my vibe.
[5:37:10] Calyxise: hunter?
[5:37:18] Collnaris: spamming chat with porous polishing abrasive
[5:37:25] AIph4__: Death Knights are fun solo
[5:37:30] Michelanio: How close to 100% are you?
[5:37:33] JUTZE: I feel so squishy playing Druid. I like huting rares, completionist stuff and professions. Feel like hunter is solid
[5:37:49] Collnaris: what spec
[5:38:00] Collnaris: boomkin has gotten super squishy
[5:38:03] Mordotzz: guardian is pretty solid
[5:38:08] kizora94: I just started leveling a PLD
[5:38:11] Michelanio: okay, well you def got this
[5:38:11] MrKanng: Slacking Kappa
[5:38:12] denk21345: if you do achies and mounts etc druids are nice to get around with speed builds and speed sets
[5:38:21] Taylor131313: boomkin is the only spec that consistently needss externals to survive high keys @AnnieFuchsia
[5:38:24] Taylor131313: Pepepains
[5:38:25] SoWizardAni: rogue can sneak around a lot of danger
[5:38:34] notzemy: @Taylor131313 Not the only
[5:38:39] JUTZE: @AIph4__ But arent they really slow feeling, DKs?
[5:38:39] notzemy: Hunters are squishy too
[5:38:53] Calli_C: Disc priest used to be able to survive anything. Is that still the case?
[5:38:57] Collnaris: they overly destroyed boomkin survivability
[5:38:58] zed__08: i like playing outlaw peepoHappy
[5:38:59] Taylor131313: hunters have an immunity at least
[5:39:06] AIph4__: @JUTZE They're slow but super self sustainy
[5:39:08] Mirkooo: Boomkin xddDespair
[5:39:09] Michelanio: have hardly played wow in a year but some days I miss my paladin
[5:39:20] notzemy: @Taylor131313 Yeah and then nothing
[5:39:43] denk21345: just learn to use defensive and heal yourself if needed
[5:39:43] Aregolmir: anniesCheer100 anniesCheer100 anniesCheer100
[5:39:46] JUTZE: So bassicly most classes are pretty valid? I tried doing rares on a shammy. That felt awful
[5:39:48] Collnaris: having to swap to bear mid fight doing no dmg and praying you don't die Laughge
[5:39:54] denk21345: boomkin should be nice for m+ now too
[5:40:27] Calli_C: Shaman is the red headed step child of wow. No offense, Annie
[5:40:41] Taylor131313: your warlock gets bodied by rares Despairge

[5:40:47] Makkan780: i can solo them on my warrior but just take long
[5:40:49] Makkan780: ye
[5:41:04] denk21345: voidwalker, soulburn and drainlife
[5:41:10] Lorrdzik: I think for solo best could be class that can be any role, like paladin, for rare you would just to tank spec
[5:41:14] Wardrick7: they want you to group up but they forget that old content is usually done solo
[5:41:17] Calyxise: @JUTZE Gear is also huge,  along with making sure you're using all of your skills properly.
[5:41:27] Taylor131313: voidwalker can't even taunt rares, I think
[5:41:39] MrKanng: @Makkan780 a fellow GIGACHAD
[5:41:40] bakingbad: also what is it with some rares being "rares" that aren't actually rares
[5:41:48] Mirkooo: @MrKanng GIGACHAD
[5:41:48] bakingbad: like why is there subsections of rare mobs -_-
[5:41:54] JUTZE: @Calyxise Yeah for sure. I like the thought of warlock and hunters having pets that take agro though
[5:41:56] Calli_C: Ah, the 'elites'
[5:42:07] bakingbad: yeh it's so annoying
[5:42:12] Calli_C: Drop grey's and laugh at you
[5:42:51] bakingbad: and some have like a star beside their name and not the iconic dragon banner
[5:43:34] Calyxise: @JUTZE As a hunter main,  you def can get away with a lot!  Making your pets take aggro,  you can keep heals on them the whole time,  you have turtle and exhiliration..  If you have a tank pet you have a third defensive.  You also have an ability that makes you run faster,  so makes solo dungeon runs more enjoyable.
[5:43:51] BouzsiTV: looking at returning to Retail after a year off, playing Wrath only... any thoughts on a race/class combo? I play enh shaman main on Wrath and like it al ot...
[5:44:01] Harlowyn: AH guy standing right next to you btw :)
[5:44:32] Taylor131313: not there
[5:44:33] Aegis_2566: It's always the Jeeves
[5:44:35] bakingbad: just across the street
[5:44:37] JUTZE: @JUTZE Yup, I feel like hunter is solid for solo content. Same with warlock having pets also
[5:44:39] AIph4__: Vulpera Shaman gets super cute fox totems
[5:44:49] Collnaris: you're out of oil
[5:44:56] bakingbad: go right
[5:45:08] BouzsiTV: Is Vulp alliance or horde? I can't remember =x
[5:45:19] AIph4__: Vulpera is horde
[5:45:21] zed__08: it's horde Misery
