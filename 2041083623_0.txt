[1:29:09] Artycuno: the art style can stay the same but graphics can improve
[1:29:13] Baf0: they can try to aim for matching their CGI
[1:29:15] Baf0: yeah
[1:30:02] ShikakuZen: Yeah, wow looks so bad
[1:30:14] Baf0: first impressions matter
[1:30:18] szopchuu: wow is scaled up textures pretending to be new games
[1:31:06] szopchuu: they still use same warcraft engine from 20 years ago theyre pushing boundaries as they can lol
[1:31:24] metavahn231: its not a medal of honor that people are playing this game on toasters, those players hold everyone back being 20 fps and have 500 ping
[1:31:35] ShikakuZen: KEKW
[1:32:17] SnowFlan_: 2 negatives make a positive right? COPIUM

[1:34:40] Baf0: yeah a large majority of the playerbase don't even "play" the game
[1:34:59] shakin_bacon: can we talk about how based it was that they're giving out free fantasia to EVERYONE with the update also, thats the polar opposite of something blizard would do
[1:35:16] djcostcosamples: wow is hard to get into too unless you've played before
[1:36:04] SnowFlan_: the cartoony look isn't for everyone and just have to respect that
[1:36:24] whaat: people still play maple coz its cute AYAYA
[1:37:08] SCMSV: for me the graphics of a MMO isn't as strong of a factor as gameplay but I can see how it is

[1:39:21] RayminousXIV: the reason why i choose 14 as my first MMO instead of wow , becuz i cant wank to wow character
[1:39:50] Artycuno: on the flip side, hyper realistic graphics isn't necessarily a good thing too. a lot of games starting to look the same
[1:40:46] metavahn231: only did ffxi story to get to the freaking sea zones
[1:43:58] ramneson: uuh
[1:44:49] SCMSV: I would say its not that overwhelming as a new player but not everyone's the same
[1:45:02] SCMSV: game certainly has a shitload of stuff to digest though
[1:45:05] pringlez91: WoW boss music too
[1:45:23] pringlez91: needs to change
[1:45:25] ramneson: bm hunter is really simple but it's actually fun to play
[1:45:30] FoxHeals: i think FF could learn from the class diversity of wow tho. but otherwise ff its best
[1:46:43] Artycuno: isn't it difficult to balance all those classes though
[1:47:16] pringlez91: maybe they can add specs to FF classes
[1:47:40] FoxHeals: but in ff, everyone has same tools (mits) so dmg only thing that matters. then u get bad phases where mch is useless.
[1:47:45] ramneson: it's pretty much impossible to balance, that's why some specs are broken and others are garbage
[1:47:53] SCMSV: Could safely assume its difficult to balance the 30-odd specs in WoW, seems pretty alright currently but they are also having hero talent trees in new expac so who knows
[1:48:01] asmodai4823: KEKW
[1:48:02] ramneson: but it's fun when you play a broken class Shruge

[1:50:49] asmodai4823: nah surv was op in SL S3/S4
[1:50:55] asmodai4823: was played alot
[1:50:56] ramneson: survival was broken af at the end of Shadowlands. It's the tuning that is garbage
[1:51:14] pringlez91: WoW have millions of free play testers
[1:51:43] SCMSV: The Hero Talent trees could definitely do what you're saying
[1:52:03] SCMSV: If they could combine specs into one tree w/ choices
[1:52:17] SCMSV: but that's not what they're doing afaik, idk they only showed us four classes
[1:53:11] FoxHeals: @Arthars is it healthy for ff tanks to all have rampart, rep, a 30% and aoe mit? i think no.
[1:54:05] FoxHeals: does this not mean that dmg is the only difference maker though?
[1:54:12] ramneson: homogenization helps a lot with the balance of the game but it's a double edge sword
[1:55:34] pringlez91: Dont wrry, WoW will get it this time in The War Within
[1:56:49] ramneson: Sadge benched
[1:56:59] asmodai4823: thats because the content was easier before

[2:01:34] SCMSV: No, because it already ended
[2:01:51] SCMSV: It's on Wowhead if you wanna check results per class
[2:02:04] SCMSV: Yes every spec
[2:02:49] SCMSV: So it's the mog winner + set per spec
[2:02:51] cyberend7: artharsMagnum artharsMagnum

[2:04:52] SCMSV: Blizzard did say they'd balance these but of course the community doesn't really believe they will do it well haha
[2:05:00] asmodai4823: they are rebalancing the tier sets
[2:05:13] ramneson: Looking
[2:05:16] SCMSV: So some better gameplay sets got voted out compared to those with good numbers
[2:05:53] SCMSV: Pretty sure a warlock spec got S1 set lmao
[2:06:36] asmodai4823: HUH

[2:12:23] ramneson: 4 piece effect is super comfy for outlaw
[2:12:56] SCMSV: An idea folks floated around as a hypothetical was if you could mix and match 2pc + 2pc bonuses across the sets
[2:13:00] comicsansdog: sub is my spec and they just fucked it raw no lube
[2:13:27] ramneson: sub is way harder to play imo
[2:13:46] comicsansdog: @ramneson only if u have learning difficulties
[2:13:50] dooper_1: outlaw is way harder imo lol
[2:14:12] comicsansdog: no such thing as a "diffucult spec" in world of warcraft
[2:14:29] ramneson: @ramneson i probably have some learning difficulties but the uptime for sub is super important and difficult to achieve
[2:15:36] comicsansdog: ???
[2:15:41] shmeeplife: rogue is sweaty asf
[2:15:55] comicsansdog: oh i see
[2:16:06] comicsansdog: thought u meant it was just straight up not fun

[2:26:12] pringlez91: so why they change it?
[2:26:28] yenny__: 10.1 was the best balance the game had seen for a long while ngl
[2:26:29] pringlez91: what are the devs doing?
[2:26:33] yenny__: and then 10.1.5 awaree
[2:26:55] pringlez91: they have free game testers to give them feedbacks and it still unbalance?
[2:27:33] yenny__: augmentation also exacerbates the top performing specs to a higher degree
[2:27:37] shmeeplife: maybe strummer should play aug evoker :)
