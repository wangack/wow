[0:53:58] StreamElements: @Amangiwak69, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
[0:53:58] whiskyrbl: you're already in the server, it'll only get smoother

[7:16:01] Poleritude: Today Shroud is playing a MMO that the battle arena and Leet killers don't like. But the viewers that tune in, are the ones that actually sub and support Shroud. The 20k that are missing, are just off sending swears in someone elses chat today.
[7:16:04] SeductiveBanana: @bigable, okay Sadge

[7:20:17] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[8:14:59] wunjojo: Yes sides quests are pointless
[8:15:02] HarvardCollege: just wait for the world quest grind, it will come
[8:15:02] KEZZAYE: kinda
[8:15:04] sunlitebro: theres a main quest line i believe
[8:15:04] CruzM8: side quests are usually for rep isnt it?
[8:15:05] alpenrockzz: @shroud you have to finish campaign
[8:15:06] Gottenbree: itchy balls
[8:15:07] KEZZAYE: depends on mainline
[8:15:07] dk311: yeah , pointless ig
[8:15:16] bluebaconato: i had to get like 100k xp for 58 to continue ardenweald
[8:15:18] Zdx93: @shroud cast Lava and then flameshock
[8:15:23] UrvoTV: I think some of the side quests that give achievementas will count toward flying
[8:15:23] afendza: you can hit 60 earlier by miles
[8:15:28] chausseee: thats what im doin
[8:15:33] Makmeh: you need to do some sidequest tho
[8:15:38] KEZZAYE: I know all the game mechanics for wow and warcraft :D
[8:15:41] Makmeh: or youll get behind at some point
[8:15:46] TalkingTacos: only the mainquests wont take you to 60 tho, have to make a few sidequests
[8:15:47] Ssk3ww: I know this is a basic ass question but is wow worth getting into?
[8:15:48] TheNobear: correct
[8:15:56] KEZZAYE: it seems like you got a fairly few intelligent gamers in chat
[8:16:10] TheNobear: No don't listen to them I am 60. Just to main quest and you will be good
[8:16:12] TheSubversiveOrchestra: the sidequests in shadowlands are better than the main quests in terms of fun honestly
[8:16:13] KEZZAYE: like I like that dudes be knowledgeable on games
[8:16:21] BLuNTED_ReALiTY: @skew987 just try it.. it's free to start with
