[0:24:06] Anhak: 15 k rn still got drums ill turn in for xp on thursday
[0:24:06] FlynnFluff: so is the change in stream time due to maybe being tired during this last awc since the team stream later at night?
[0:24:25] Anhak: i wanna get to 18 k or so
[0:24:37] krome2dadome: yoo
[0:25:21] krome2dadome: i am
[0:25:32] krome2dadome: ofc

[0:28:43] nikthevoker: thats what i asked LUL
[0:29:21] weckso: is this the new stream time?
[0:29:51] nikthevoker: well dino rolled 100 i didnt want to be an ass in your run o well
[0:30:03] weckso: well, should just perma-convert to this time
[0:30:45] krome2dadome: u asked if they're hard to do? answer is no, but i cba trying to gear my 3rd alt to get into a pug when it's only 250k to get a full run
[0:31:36] krome2dadome: can get u one of u want :)
[0:32:08] weckso: not even interested in the game atm, just waiting for prepatch
[0:32:49] Anhak: mes on thursday do you plan on playing sod at all? me and av are trying to get a dungeon grp together
[0:33:35] MRRowdyRuff: @Anhak yall need a giga chad lock?
[0:33:39] xdslurpii: Mes i’m returning to the game soon from SL, who’s currently/likely to remain in a good spot, dk or warr?
[0:34:07] Anhak: @MRRowdyRuff not sure exactly what we have av is the one planing it so he should be awake soon TM
[0:34:14] terranapart: mesLiquid YO mesLiquid
[0:34:39] MRRowdyRuff: what server yall on
[0:35:28] Anhak: not sure wCShat we have
[0:35:32] nikthevoker: im finally at 480 with shit tier pieces
[0:35:33] Anhak: we are on CS
[0:35:38] nikthevoker: and no neck
[0:37:35] Anhak: so p2 launches 1 hour before now on thursday
[0:37:44] Anhak: so probably if you plan ons treaming wanna think about queue times
[0:38:09] krome2dadome: this is interesting https://www.wowhead.com/news/information-on-patch-10-2-6-no-ptr-available-coming-in-march-337589
[0:38:53] krome2dadome: yea
[0:39:01] krome2dadome: and the fact that anyone can participate in it
[0:39:05] krome2dadome: even classic ppl
[0:39:35] al_capow: woah woah woah early bird gets the worm today!
[0:39:46] al_capow: you mean I can work AND watch mes at the same time!?!
[0:39:56] MRRowdyRuff: @Anhak ah nvm im on lonewolf
[0:40:40] al_capow: woo wooo
[0:40:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10.2.6 is very mysterious, it could be a lot of fun.
[0:40:50] krome2dadome: o shit those loot drop boxes aren't unique items any more
[0:40:52] krome2dadome: in sod
[0:41:11] al_capow: you can also buy missing bfd trinkets in BB
[0:41:16] al_capow: and the exp buff is out
[0:41:23] al_capow: AND some people have been getting the new rune drops...
[0:42:28] nikthevoker: its been fixed
[0:42:28] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:43:22] al_capow: in STV it's free for all so it's going to be utterly insane, the faction doesnt even matter, you can kill everyone
[0:43:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they have tried to keep the servers balanced for factions, could be hot.
[0:44:08] dark_spearr: mes, random question, but how do you access the banner from C1? I don’t see it anywhere lol
[0:45:09] eMBeaR64oz: allo!
[0:45:27] al_capow: im almost positive there's going to be a guild that just 24/7 camps the exit out of BB
[0:45:38] nikthevoker: thiccB is a pumper on sod too LUL
[0:45:42] krome2dadome: they did say that u dont get rewards if ur in a raid group
[0:45:50] krome2dadome: so as long as u have a party in stv
[0:45:52] eMBeaR64oz: yeah for sod ima prolly try to do a lot of dungeon stuff, the questlines are always so messed up with people farming and camping things
[0:46:20] krome2dadome: idr
[0:46:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was assuming 5-man group action
[0:46:32] al_capow: apparently there's like an unkillable world boss that just 1 dings people
[0:46:32] krome2dadome: just remember raid = bad, party = good
[0:47:05] kickkasss: hey is dk or warri better option for pv
[0:47:09] kickkasss: e
[0:47:22] nikthevoker: ya ive done BFD with his group
[0:48:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: PvE balance is pretty good, you can play what you want and it's fine
[0:48:32] al_capow: im just sad they didnt add dual spec, it kinda blows they're holding back on it for some reason
[0:49:59] bobelgumm: sorry if this is a taboo subject, just got home and first time on twitch since sunday, but did the move respond to the questions about wizk and the SLTs vs liquid?
[0:50:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dual spec arrived with Wrath if I remember right
[0:50:10] Anhak: we are on a wierd client and they said they want to add it so
[0:50:46] al_capow: I'd be very surprised if it was a technical issue, since storing talent pages is relatively trivial compared to what else they've added
[0:51:21] Anhak: yea its less then 20 people
[0:52:42] Anhak: the reason we 100% know its still a classic client and not even tbc is cause of the combo point system
[0:52:47] ReApEr4O1: its dumb. season of discovery, with just reused spells. so annoying
[0:53:01] Anhak: yea they litterally said they want to
[0:53:05] eMBeaR64oz: dual spec in sod would be so nice
[0:53:32] al_capow: SoD is great just because it shows they're interested in experimenting and bouncing back with the community
[0:53:48] Anhak: can do 20 quest right now farm some wsg rep farm some runes and shit (people are farming new runes)
[0:53:58] Anhak: there is a good bit to do
[0:54:10] Anhak: also if we have the people we might do a BFD on thursday at launch
[0:54:14] Anhak: they said it be a lot of xp
[0:54:39] al_capow: I think at lv 25 it's supposed to be nearly a full level
[0:54:53] Anhak: yea judging on the stuff ive heard it might even be 2 levels
[0:54:56] eMBeaR64oz: maybe the staff will finally drop Sadge
[0:55:03] Anhak: @eMBeaR64oz LMAO
[0:55:15] Anhak: maybe mike will show up to raid for the first time in a month Sadge
[0:55:36] eMBeaR64oz: gonna be honest ive totally deleted sod from my mind lol
[0:55:41] krome2dadome: @al_capow i could see them converting sod to "classic+" once it's done
[0:55:45] eMBeaR64oz: like end of the week im like "oh shit there was a raid twice"
[0:56:21] Anhak: im fucking so hard with sod
[0:56:24] eMBeaR64oz: I wonder how much of the p1 raid gear youll keep using until 40
[0:56:28] Anhak: yea meta was inside raid
[0:56:42] krome2dadome: @eMBeaR64oz i imagine most of it
[0:56:43] Anhak: p1 raid gear isnt exactly prebis but its like pretty close
[0:56:44] eMBeaR64oz: the feral hammer i have will be nice for sure
[0:57:13] eMBeaR64oz: imagine dungeon grinding with full raid gear people
[0:57:17] eMBeaR64oz: how fast youd blast
[0:57:22] Bronloch: SoD is pretty sick
[0:57:32] al_capow: hopefully they up drop rates and quantites for bfd in p2
[0:57:36] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:57:41] krome2dadome: idk i still dont have bladestorm so
[0:57:47] krome2dadome: no aoeing for me :)
[0:57:54] al_capow: only bummer with leveling is horde side is kinda poo poo 25-40
[0:58:19] Anhak: gonan dungeon spam all 15 levels EZ
[0:58:42] al_capow: I think just deso, and then stv
[0:58:43] Anhak: stonetalon and 1k needles
[0:58:46] al_capow: shimmering flats
[0:58:51] al_capow: thousand needles kinda sucks
[0:58:53] eMBeaR64oz: @Anhak im kinda down to as well with either druid or mage
[0:58:58] eMBeaR64oz: if theres a spot
[0:59:07] Anhak: we would love a heal probably if erin wont be there
[0:59:15] eMBeaR64oz: can dps too on either
[0:59:29] al_capow: I can SM farm with my priest if we wanna cleave it
[0:59:36] al_capow: and then ill quest on my shammy
[1:00:04] Anhak: we need to get to like probably 30 or so before questing becomes even possible but at that point just stay in SM spaming quest
[1:00:13] Anhak: spaming dungeons *
[1:00:35] al_capow: the real question is whether or not to take a sick day friday hehe
[1:00:38] Anhak: RFK to SM gy at like 28 29 to lib to armory to cath
[1:00:58] Anhak: AND a lot of runes and skill books have been found inside of SM
[1:01:19] Anhak: o also
[1:01:23] Anhak: WE GOT FUCKED ON MOUNT PRICES
[1:01:30] Anhak: so if your on EU go buy your mounts right now
[1:01:46] Anhak: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/mount-prices-increased-after-maintenance-season-of-discovery-337599
[1:02:17] Anhak: wont be 50% off mount prices
[1:02:30] krome2dadome: does that say 900??
[1:02:31] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:02:44] al_capow: 900 for epic mount not 40 mount
[1:02:44] Anhak: na im not suprised just sad cause i was like o shit ill have plenty of gold to now im like okay i need more gold
[1:02:56] krome2dadome: @Anhak this
[1:03:45] al_capow: noooo
[1:04:01] Anhak: cause i have like 160 gold so im feeling decent still but
[1:04:10] al_capow: currency bloat makes it more confusing for new players to join into
[1:04:17] nikthevoker: what
[1:04:18] Anhak: ahmpy has 6 or 7 k gold
[1:04:19] nikthevoker: 10k+
[1:04:31] Anhak: the problem is
[1:04:34] Anhak: that change doesnt hurt them
[1:04:48] nikthevoker: keyvan made like 1k 1 night
[1:04:54] nikthevoker: he just didnt sleep boosting
[1:05:32] Anhak: that change hurts the people who play casually and dont farm
[1:06:26] Anhak: like you mike etc who have maybe 25 gold and was gonna be comfortable to get mount at 40 now you gotta worry about gold
[1:06:33] al_capow: I feel like the solution is just not to make gold a limiting factor in player enjoyment/experience
[1:06:45] al_capow: that's why I like rep grinds instead of needing to gold farm
[1:07:04] kklinker: Sup, Mesington.
[1:07:11] kklinker: Good good
[1:07:13] kklinker: Just got home frmo work.

[1:10:44] Anhak: a decent gold sink is they added the ability to buy void pearl trinkets in booty bay for 75 gold
[1:10:52] thunderstud25: is this a full time change? or just for a little?
[1:11:03] krome2dadome: yea

[1:43:17] happyheals: just had a hunter purposely dance and do nothing on my turn so that I would lose. I am seeing this too much. It feels like they are boosting people in solo shuffle.
[1:43:22] anmusallam: hello mesman
[1:43:29] anmusallam: how are you sir
[1:43:36] kklinker: This is redonkulous.
[1:43:44] happyheals: yeah
[1:43:47] happyheals: on my dh
[1:44:06] ZealotryTV: @kklinker 97 plate wearers in every group q lol
[1:44:06] honsou2: how do you mostly use meld as dk? is it just avoid a cast button
[1:44:41] krome2dadome: @happyheals just ppl raging. happens to everyone. just gotta go next
[1:44:58] happyheals: it just sucks because it messes up your mmr for the ladder climb
[1:45:35] americanmoses18: yea solo shuffle is league of legends levels of toxic
[1:45:58] happyheals: they weren't raging. They had won 5 rounds and just sat and danced the last round on my team lol
[1:46:12] honsou2: i feel like the fact they made it shuffle and not a normal 1 game per queue made it much more toxic
[1:46:22] sunileif: buff mm
[1:46:53] happyheals: yeah lol mm doing more dmg than all other people in the arena combined
[1:47:11] sunileif: @kklinker Saususge RainTime
[1:48:01] honsou2: its not that rare imo, its like u can punish one of ur teammates that made you salty and still get + rating
[1:48:01] americanmoses18: Saususge
[1:48:16] krome2dadome: were they throwing because of u or because of the healer? was somebody raging at them?
[1:48:22] happyheals: I dunno, I find these weird people, it almost seems like they were a booster
[1:48:32] americanmoses18: i called a healer out for being 1-4 and said "healer diff" and he just proceeded to run in and die hahaha
[1:48:53] shaybacktv: peepoHey
[1:48:58] happyheals: no one was talking at all in my game, just call outs
[1:49:09] honsou2: thats why i dont like shuffle, someone can start mald in r1 and then the whole lobby is bad
[1:49:19] americanmoses18: i legit refuse to type in solo till ppl start talking shit
[1:49:21] donnyprovolone: eh when people are being shitty in solos sometimes i just dont heal em and let em die lol, even iuf itt tanks my rating
[1:49:21] krome2dadome: feel like it would be incredibly difficult, time consuming, and obvious to boost someone in shuffle by win-trading lmao
[1:49:53] honsou2: wintrading is deffo possible but like, if ur not very high rated its probably not that
[1:50:00] happyheals: it is a service offered on real money sites
[1:50:11] americanmoses18: once u comment or are rude to me ill respond. but i refuse to throw rounds if u throw rounds ur a garbage player and shud be banned
[1:50:26] nikthevoker: @happyheals ^
[1:50:28] krome2dadome: no leggo on the ret
[1:50:39] FlynnFluff: I bet it’s easier to win trade as a healer in solo shuffles
[1:50:44] americanmoses18: awww we feel so badddd.....NOT @krome2dadome
[1:50:52] honsou2: @happyheals where?
[1:50:56] krome2dadome: #3 or 4 i think?
[1:50:58] happyheals: they have multiple people q that deranked and then they get a person who bought their service and make sure they get 4 wins each time
[1:52:15] happyheals: the hunter prob needed the person on the other team to win to get their 4
[1:52:19] americanmoses18: god its so much easier to play and win
[1:52:28] sunileif: !throw
[1:52:51] happyheals: I was trying to make them a villian
[1:52:56] krome2dadome: i highly doubt it was a boost...
[1:53:24] happyheals: ah
[1:53:30] honsou2: dont even need to whisper, could just have lined wrong for 1 second. Shuffle is like that
[1:53:37] happyheals: it kept me from a win so it sucked
[1:53:38] nikthevoker: ive gotten many a death threat, told to KMS and drink bleach in shuffle, some people are insane
[1:53:43] americanmoses18: suni throws rounds i know
[1:54:07] kklinker: brb gotta use the restroom
[1:54:10] americanmoses18: imagine getting mad at a video game and telling someone to die LOL go touch grass
[1:54:15] mayfire15: 474 isnt geareed enough for heroic? lol
[1:54:50] FlynnFluff: I try not to get mad but I had a shaman healer static my sheep target out of my range for resheep and we lost because of it
[1:54:58] americanmoses18: i know u wont wait but ill have a fyrakk id this weekend at best
[1:55:07] FlynnFluff: it was mad frustrating
[1:55:27] happyheals: I was healing 20s at 439, but people in pugs def are picky to make sure the gear can carry a mediocre player
[1:55:54] nikthevoker: @FlynnFluff i had a shaman static people on to me after hovering away every time LUL
[1:56:07] FlynnFluff: lol
[1:56:16] kklinker: pass lead i guess
[1:56:32] honsou2: ive unbound enter button so i dont talk in shuffle, i find even saying target can result in tilt
[1:56:45] kklinker: Just text me then if you want to wait for Ave
[1:56:53] Anhak: im kinda suprised ave aint up yet
[1:56:54] nikthevoker: im down to help, but i dont raid anymore so i cant link mythic kills :(

[1:58:52] ZealotryTV: im so stoked to kill 50 Billion HP bosses in dungeons next expansion
[1:59:06] ZealotryTV: the fact they arent doing a squish is so troll
[1:59:06] Anhak: o mes did you see/hear that we are suppose to be getting tier tokens for p2? so no longer will we be chasing 1 boot and getting 4 boomkin boots etc
[1:59:23] happyheals: I miss the old rbg days lol
[1:59:30] crusadein: if they do too many stat squishes its just going to look weird at low levels
[1:59:41] americanmoses18: rbgs were fun man
[1:59:43] happyheals: for sure
[1:59:45] Anhak: they have already done too many stat squishes..
[1:59:47] honsou2: @crusadein who cares
[2:00:15] FlynnFluff: I just want to see 40million crots
[2:00:18] FlynnFluff: crits

[2:01:28] eMBeaR64oz: or diablo 3, "264B, 16T"
[2:01:40] Anhak: the problem with that logic. is some specs TRADITIONALLY do a bunch of little damage and give less seratonin
[2:01:43] happyheals: if it goes too high, critical strike damage buffing classes will be too op
[2:02:11] Anhak: 214 k etc etc etc
[2:02:29] Anhak: Garrosh had more hp then the code could handle
[2:02:32] sunileif: thats why garrosh was 2 parts

[2:27:36] happyheals: I just threw the sandwich and went inside. They are vicious and their bite can give you diseases
[2:27:50] sunileif: but there claws are incredible dirty and a scratch can prove deadly

[3:01:57] Lythi: 4 healers is good enough if they´re strong but 5 healers always is a safe bet imo
[3:02:06] Lythi: especially if you´re going past 14 dps

[3:12:36] ArtofAzeroth: Hi, Mes
[3:14:16] Loadedmvp: @notmes you use only easyframes or combinating it with dif frames addon too ?
[3:15:08] Loadedmvp: yeah i kinda dont like the red overlay when in combat
[3:16:31] PhilthyMutt: you can make it green I believe but it turns everyone green @notmes
[3:17:09] Loadedmvp: i would actually like more addons option for frames, like this one is not bad, jax is like buggy as hell always and besides those there is just like elvui and stuff like that
[3:19:45] al_capow: I think it would be cool if they could find a way to remove secure frame tainting, and instead try to implement frame contexts that users can allow permissions for
[3:19:56] al_capow: anyway to give more flexibility for custom frames

[4:11:10] Vigi9413: for like undergeared alts n stuff
[4:12:21] al_capow: HC might be dead imo
[4:12:26] al_capow: i dont think SSF will revive it
[4:12:42] al_capow: sod is just way too hype especially with new content 60+
[4:13:10] Vigi9413: just wait mes they'll have SoD hardcore next
[4:13:20] diperna99: do you have to restart for SOD part 2?
[4:13:44] Vigi9413: wait cata is in summer?
[4:13:51] al_capow: ST I bet
[4:13:54] Vigi9413: we're gonna be in RS for that long?
[4:13:57] Vigi9413: jeeeeez
[4:14:07] al_capow: ST or Mara
[4:14:10] al_capow: Mara is a good candidate
[4:14:26] Begasaur: they will prolly just do diremaul
[4:14:27] al_capow: I think BRD will be a 60 raid
[4:14:46] TheBackstabi: ST can be entered at 35 and there's a pretty solid quest dagger from there, I'm assuming we'll find out if it's a likely candidate if it's locked
[4:14:52] al_capow: inb4 hyjal raid
[4:15:34] Vigi9413: didn't we already do hyjal?
[4:15:47] al_capow: it would be cool if they put something in deadwind pass, since that zone doesnt have anything
[4:16:10] Vigi9413: yeah we did mt hyjal in TBC
[4:16:19] TheBackstabi: Strictly speaking Black Morass and Escape from Durnholde are in the game - to what degree I'm unsure, but the maps exist and there's references to bosses
[4:16:48] happyheals: we gotta go back in time and steal Deathwings egg and raise him to be good
[4:17:15] Begasaur: theres also pretty big rumors about karazhan crypts right
[4:17:59] Begasaur: they are low key considering crypts a leak because of some screenshots when they originally showed SoD
[4:18:31] Vigi9413: mes how would you rank the wow xpacs right now? from best --> worst (in your opinion)
[4:20:00] sunileif: cause you met me?
[4:20:03] sunileif: ;3
[4:20:17] sunileif: no? ok ,_,)
[4:20:44] fullsendingsince96: youd think wotlk would be best since you know dk lol
[4:21:17] bones1088: is this an xpac ranking or a pvp ranking ?
[4:21:20] Vigi9413: i can't put much over Legion... but Shadowlands led to me joining this community
[4:21:23] Vigi9413: so i love it for that
[4:21:42] melbu2423: dk dual weild frost was steamrolling in cata
[4:21:54] fullsendingsince96: mop ove wod over cata
[4:22:16] bones1088: ooo spicy take
[4:22:23] Vigi9413: so BFA below WOD for you?
[4:22:42] Vigi9413: cause i agree with it if that's true
[4:22:55] sunileif: sod g tier
[4:23:04] fullsendingsince96: i think mop had the best pvp but im bias cuz i got my first r1 and ill rep my prideful gladiator proud
[4:23:17] JustVoIta: cant wait for cata classic ngl
[4:23:17] Vigi9413: it was goood... until it wasn't
[4:23:25] TheBackstabi: What's the context of this tier list or is it just general
[4:23:37] ahmopasha: Hi all
[4:23:57] Vigi9413: so personally when its all said in done Shadowlands is the best
[4:24:27] swaggitto: you deserve it all honestly
[4:24:35] Vigi9413: gameplay wise i think it's hard to beat Legion tbh
[4:25:12] Vigi9413: but people do forget that the beginning of legion was not good
[4:25:19] JustVoIta: For me it was MoP. I enjoyed the raids also we had a good legendary quest line and a good last raid which had more bosses then 8
[4:25:43] kvoythe: Best PVP Expo was MoP
[4:26:16] panjack13: dragon flight is so fun, love the PvP (coming from wrath especially)
[4:26:18] Vigi9413: i hope they bring back brewmaster monks being able to use guard on two allies lmao
[4:26:23] Vigi9413: that was broken in rbgs
[4:26:29] swaggitto: taste for blood one shots and bm hunter stampede lol
[4:26:41] fullsendingsince96: swifty era
[4:27:03] Vigi9413: mop is when people started really streaming pvp though right?
[4:27:36] fullsendingsince96: that was back when bajheera was himmothy
[4:27:48] JustVoIta: Cata was Blood dk pvp
[4:27:51] Vigi9413: back when sodapoppin actually still played

[4:28:18] Anhak: soda has always played wow just doesnt stream it always
[4:28:37] JustVoIta: @notmes do you will play cata pvp ?
[4:29:05] Anhak: for the longest time he played on privates in his free time and then streamed variety
[4:29:07] Vigi9413: has branching out ever occured to you? not that i want you to
[4:30:05] Anhak: honestly classic hc and sod are all "branching out" from being a "retail pvp streamer"

[4:33:23] raven1103: Btw did u see the new glad mount in next season? I'm trying so much to improve so I can get it, by far my favorite
[4:33:56] raven1103: On wowhead seems like it is since its also on PTR
[4:33:56] Vigi9413: what's your favorite glad mount that you've gotten
[4:35:12] raven1103: I hope MMR changes will come next season, so its not as rough cause ma god i want that mount xd
[4:35:40] Vigi9413: how did winning awc last year compare to winning blizzcon
[4:36:17] honsou2: @raven1103 realistically it will be harder next season because even fewer people will play
[4:36:58] raven1103: I see what you're saying but if they giga inflating it, surely more will get the rewards
[4:37:50] honsou2: theyre not going to
[4:37:56] honsou2: why wouldnt they do it now then
[4:38:14] raven1103: @honsou2 I wish, oh I wish I had the answer for that

[5:02:31] Anhak: for my rogue parses now :)
[5:02:53] krome2dadome: enhance tank NODDERS
[5:02:59] Anhak: stormstrike increases the targets nature damage recieved by 20% for 12 seconds in sod doesnt have charges
[5:03:12] Anhak: so 20% poisons buff and 20% more envenom damage
[5:03:22] Anhak: its worth about 60 dps for me LMAO
[5:03:48] Anhak: uh idk i asked earlier and i either didnt see it or he didnt say
[5:03:54] thunderstud25: i can be your hero
[5:03:56] Anhak: SAF is playing Shammy i think enhance but idk

[5:09:22] stillthechamp: mastery shown is bugged right? no way you have 70%
[5:09:44] Not_Bel: probably real
[5:10:14] Anhak: also thats a 20% buff the windserpent but windserpent doesnt get a new rank of blast til lvl 41 so they are probably bad
[5:10:58] stillthechamp: but how? i compared petkick etc and myself fully geared and i have about 43%
[5:11:07] stillthechamp: something aint right
[5:13:26] yourKnightmaare: mes, when I use your plater profile from wago with !nameplates it doesn't have the icons above totems.
[5:13:46] rogast46: Thank you for the games Mes <3 I was the priest
[5:14:32] rogast46: Yeah I play mindbender build
[5:15:07] rogast46: that was super close, I was thinking we were going to lose
[5:15:43] yourKnightmaare: I apologize for bugging mes.
[5:16:28] yourKnightmaare: okay. thank you
[5:16:36] sloppiione: have to name the profile "ilovemes" for it to work, that's how i got mine working
[5:17:04] yourKnightmaare: ^ gonna do just this haha
[5:23:53] sloppiione: do you still coil yourself in lichborne to stay healthy? i find it pog now that coils cleave onto enemies
[5:23:53] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:24:10] sloppiione: or is a deathstrike still better
[5:24:14] yourKnightmaare: mes, I know it's probably the most minmax idea. but what if we tried to rng pieces with speed and just do leech enchants on dk? would that be something? probably a dumb question lol
[5:24:30] sloppiione: yes cleaves onto enemies still
[5:25:11] krome2dadome: @yourKnightmaare he's tried that recently and i think he liked it?
[5:25:48] yourKnightmaare: oh sick sick haha. because I keep getting speed items in vault
[5:26:05] krome2dadome: those dont work in pvp
[5:26:14] yourKnightmaare: oh that's odd
[5:27:47] yourKnightmaare: then ultimately it was a dumb question haha
[5:28:19] sloppiione: sorry i lied on my previous comment about coil still cleaving onto enemies, i tried it on dummy just then. maybe i was imagining things, it does cleave to your pets though i just learned.
[5:28:39] sloppiione: if used onself with lichborne up*
[5:29:59] jonathanl0l: sry mes i am slightly undergeared

[6:05:14] yourKnightmaare: mes is there a way to filter specific totems on plater? just trying to give important totems the pink healthbar. I apologize again if I'm bugging. I'm all over reddit trying to figure this out
[6:05:16] avenueone: pressumably
[6:05:34] Anhak: yea it should be mostly boss xp because its using the hardcore xp model
[6:05:34] avenueone: no ptr so no1 actually knows?
[6:05:53] Anhak: but non boss xp still good
[6:05:59] happyheals: they are intelligent making dungeons replayable
[6:06:07] Anhak: in thoery RFD should be the play around 35 because it has so many bosses
[6:06:07] happyheals: something they forgot over the years
[6:06:23] happyheals: like new season, no more run dungeon bye bye

[7:10:15] frostgodxeek: thanks man!
[7:10:32] WagwanBombaClatBomba: its the frost king jazggzPOG
[7:10:49] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @frostgodxeek trenXD
[7:11:09] frostgodxeek: true
[7:11:16] frostgodxeek: definitely regretted not playing ww dk on the last game
[7:11:55] frostgodxeek: yeah thats a great point, dalaran only having 2 pillars kinda sucks too looking back on it
[7:11:57] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i think rsham is bis for frost dk, static the go
[7:12:04] frostgodxeek: @WagwanBombaClatBomba frostg16GIGACHAD
[7:12:08] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and full blast
[7:12:59] frostgodxeek: spriest also doesnt deal with slows as well as most classes so we can definitely get some moments where the sp cant even connect to any of us on a bigger map
[7:14:06] afortunatesoul: i was the druid GG <3
[7:14:23] frostgodxeek: yeah black rook feels a lot better into wizard cleaves
[7:16:40] frostgodxeek: definitely feel super confident playing in cup 2 again tho, most teams have to play insane to not die to some of those setups
[7:17:26] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @frostgodxeek play with arms, spear on the go into sharpen gg trenXD
[7:17:26] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[7:17:45] frostgodxeek: @WagwanBombaClatBomba haha yeah we actually do play the tsg sometimes
[7:17:47] LUIGY_3: l# b j@u@uk@
[7:17:57] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i swear lowkey its insane
[7:18:03] WagwanBombaClatBomba: with intervenes and fear peels
[7:20:52] frostgodxeek: @WagwanBombaClatBomba i like it with pres evoker a lot, because one go u can avatar + spear and then the next go the evoker can opressing roar deep breath on the blind
[7:21:38] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @frostgodxeek oh yea with pres that sounds juicy
[7:21:43] WagwanBombaClatBomba: the deep breath wall
[7:21:45] WagwanBombaClatBomba: lock em in
[7:21:50] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Kreygasm
[7:22:16] WagwanBombaClatBomba: y
[7:22:26] WagwanBombaClatBomba: frost just need good goes and as much goes as possible
[7:22:31] happyheals: Ive looked at spear and it isnt worth it
[7:22:36] frostgodxeek: he doesn't gain too much damage on the go from the roar build anyway so it ends up feeling good still. but outside of go damage definitely takes a hit with spear
[7:22:47] frostgodxeek: spear itself actually hits pretty hard with the talent too
[7:23:10] happyheals: you lose stam and shockwave and 10% fear red
[7:23:19] frostgodxeek: yeah we were messing around with a roar build playstyle. maybe with disc and just stacking a bunch of dmg modifiers
[7:23:43] frostgodxeek: still really like spear just because it feels strong even when someone trinkets that go
[7:24:08] frostgodxeek: i think u could maybe stay in as TSG if u try really hard and the healer is good
[7:24:25] WagwanBombaClatBomba: frost is so squishy tho
[7:24:34] WagwanBombaClatBomba: u have to run outside goes
[7:24:36] frostgodxeek: might force some cds u wont usually get and it will facilitate the grip blind goes too
[7:24:59] TofuRious_: thats been my biggest gripe with fDK..in m++ it feels great with icecap. you have pof every 30 sec...but in pvp you dont have enough stats to spread across mast/crit/haste  AND vers.
[7:25:17] frostgodxeek: oh yeah, the base damage on chill streak and oblits are high right now, the strength is so bad nowadays after the nerfs
[7:25:31] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ye
[7:25:36] WagwanBombaClatBomba: u just fall behind
[7:25:59] WagwanBombaClatBomba: maybe u could play aggresive with razorice rune
[7:26:04] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and get big frost trikes
[7:26:09] frostgodxeek: its like blood dk levels of pressure outside of go but without the part where u are unkillable hehe
[7:26:41] TofuRious_: @frostgodxeek at least get blood get execute with DS
[7:26:43] frostgodxeek: dude i was so surprised when i tested blood's burst
[7:27:39] nikthevoker: those DS get chunky

[7:55:46] Lamatastisch: Sadge
[7:56:59] Lamatastisch: I wish they would just unnerf DS a bit or AMS Sadge
[7:57:19] avenueone: who is the most highest up developer and what is his class
[7:57:19] sunileif: clearly a rogue player leads the balance changes
[7:57:55] sunileif: remove gouge from pvp
[7:57:56] Anhak: Kermit: Yellow class best class
[7:58:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm still not sure exactly how but that frost DK in AWC was healing for a lot more on his death strikes than the unholy DK's did. I guess maybe more vers
[7:58:35] avenueone: ww rogue hpriest is clearly the meta
[7:58:47] avenueone: just a bunch of guys that have barely ever played together
[7:58:55] heresjohnnny: ww slaps atm
[8:01:12] avenueone: i thought we were gonna see echo play twd
[8:01:20] avenueone: or rogue dk
[8:03:21] Anhak: buff outlaw TBH
[8:05:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I'm not sure why, but it seemed like unholy death strikes healed in the 70K range, but the frost guy seemed to get like 90K's.
[8:05:58] josephzein: what build do u use for 2s?
[8:06:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I should go back and look at those recaps more
[8:16:36] krome2dadome: how do u spam 2s all day man
[8:16:41] krome2dadome: i'd lose my mind
[8:17:27] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[8:17:50] plebcake_: any frost 2s? mesHeart
[8:17:52] krome2dadome: idk maybe it's just not my cuppa tea
[8:18:17] avenueone: hes pretending all his opponents are fyrakk
[8:18:20] avenueone: not giving him a weapon
[8:18:26] krome2dadome: tru
[8:21:13] americanmoses18: no wep for most (shut up krome) = treating players like fyrakk
[8:22:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Xeek had some death strike heals of 115K and 125K in one match, and Claudio's biggest was like 90K but generally in the 60's and 70's
[8:23:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I guess that must just be working off that accumulated damage in the last 5 seconds of the death strikes
[8:23:42] avenueone: iv gotta flip my schedule 180 in the next 2 days lol
[8:23:57] avenueone: iv been going to sleep about when sod launches
[8:24:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've been trying to think of ways to make death strike heals more effective and it mostly comes back to how Drake gemmed his ret paladin that one time - for stamina and vers
[8:25:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't tested out that leech interaction we may have seen a bit of the other day
[8:25:42] avenueone: if not spamming join server when it goes live
[8:25:46] avenueone: there will 100% be an insane queue
[8:26:03] avenueone: yes there was!
[8:26:09] avenueone: i was 10k in queue
[8:26:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah a lot of hype

[8:29:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: I keep hearing about lions for hunters

[9:12:16] longdongliam_: yurr
[9:12:32] sunileif: now i feel i should watch this
[9:13:29] Anhak: @sunileif Mario wasnt "better" but mario was a better goal scorer argueably the best of all time. But injurys and cancer kinda ruined his career
[9:14:00] sunileif: D;
[9:14:12] sunileif: bet he hated rogues too
[9:14:35] sunileif: dont question it just accept it
[9:14:42] Anhak: unlikely hes a quebecer probably a big payo fan
[9:15:41] Anhak: best player of all time is widely accepted as Gretz the only names you can put in that convo is mario and orr anyone else is not even close
[9:15:42] sunileif: 1000% hated rogues
[9:15:54] WagwanBombaClatBomba: HAHAHAHA
