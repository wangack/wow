I remember the good old days when you broke 6 ribs because I didn’t give you lunch money or when you savagely beat Rick because he looked at you wrong. Haha good times. I’m glad you got out of prison after beating up those 12 bums in the park and shooting that cop in the leg! I hope to see you back in town to treat you to dinner at that restaurant you robbed. See you soon!

[2:52:49] n0tDef1ned: COPIUM
[2:53:00] camgirlxo: Maybe its not so much on the state on shadow right now,but more on how far the other classes are ahead
[2:53:29] jaime: they will lose every single game
[2:53:30] jaime: 0 chance
[2:53:35] jaime: (if they pick shadow)
[2:53:43] iiiidan1994: shadow myb good only for cleave and doing small brusts

[2:55:08] n0tDef1ned: KEKW
[2:55:17] Friightz: @iiiidan1994 he was literally perma stuck in cc, ofc he didn't do much dmg

[3:10:10] Lontartv: is good money tho
[3:10:16] Limmee_wow: streaming prolly isnt as easy as people may think, but its still easier than manual labor
[3:10:17] n0tDef1ned: tbh i think lontar has it the worst, playing all day and still not getting as many views as whaazz, and then also he has to deal with whaazz's playing
[3:10:24] n0tDef1ned: i mean
[3:10:27] infernion: Different jobs are just taxing in different ways
[3:10:31] lacusdark: i work in accounting and its brutal  working from 8 to 9
