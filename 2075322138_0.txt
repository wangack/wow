[2:52:49] n0tDef1ned: COPIUM
[2:53:00] camgirlxo: Maybe its not so much on the state on shadow right now,but more on how far the other classes are ahead
[2:53:29] jaime: they will lose every single game
[2:53:30] jaime: 0 chance
[2:53:35] jaime: (if they pick shadow)
[2:53:43] iiiidan1994: shadow myb good only for cleave and doing small brusts

[2:55:08] n0tDef1ned: KEKW
[2:55:17] Friightz: @iiiidan1994 he was literally perma stuck in cc, ofc he didn't do much dmg
[2:55:32] jaime: if outlaw enables sp, it enables destro much more
[2:55:33] jaime: lol
[2:55:52] jaime: rps 0-6 fastest airport run history guarenteed

[3:09:54] Lontartv: 10h every day
[3:10:10] Lontartv: is good money tho
[3:10:16] Limmee_wow: streaming prolly isnt as easy as people may think, but its still easier than manual labor
[3:10:17] n0tDef1ned: tbh i think lontar has it the worst, playing all day and still not getting as many views as whaazz, and then also he has to deal with whaazz's playing
[3:10:24] n0tDef1ned: i mean
[3:10:27] infernion: Different jobs are just taxing in different ways
[3:10:31] lacusdark: i work in accounting and its brutal  working from 8 to 9
