[7:19:25] wow_newguyhere: there's a video of it
[7:19:36] Ivey_Live: they nerf the 2 tier bonus (mad bombadier) dmg for targets above 8 @Swifty it aims towards MDI
[7:19:41] wow_newguyhere: that's why survival in m+ is absolutely busted atm
[7:19:43] xXxOrisMaxyxXx: well I killed 10 bosses that drops tier and didnt got one :/, and I think this tier will get nerfed anyways :D
[7:19:57] EvoCyberNation: The need to nerf warlock's chaos bolt, rogue's eviscerate, paladin's art of war, warrior's charge, etc. That would make it fair
[7:20:04] dbcltko: I THOUGHT U QUIT RETAIL SWOFTY
[7:20:07] Andymain86: Only nerf beyond 8 targets
[7:20:07] sonartwitchtv: if i run into you, ill run into you World
[7:20:08] EvoCyberNation: Those are the highest damaging classes
[7:20:09] Jesdawow: No they are nerfing the cluster legendary, not the tier set
[7:20:16] Ivey_Live: *above 8 targets. who cares @Swifty
[7:20:46] Creedmoir: You should get a standing desk
[7:20:57] JumiHealz: if all classes are broken it means no class is broken
[7:21:06] Jesdawow: @Swifty they are only nerfing the cluster legendary, not the tier.
[7:21:07] wow_newguyhere: remember how busted unholy DK was at the beginning of SL? because of the pet dmg on their mastery? and then they nerfed it
[7:21:11] EvoCyberNation: @rambogandalf, it isn't about likes or dislikes, it's about making it even across the board.  :)
