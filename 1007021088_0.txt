[1:46:16] Aravarth: all's I'm saying is, they need to legalise recreational cannabis use nationwide in the States like they did in Canada
[1:47:03] GodKingMuninn: @Aravarth  It's snowballing fast, but I also hope that it doesn't happen all at once because there would be a MAJOR shortage.
[1:47:12] ceebz: no drugs or guns here in the UK, we are boring
[1:47:22] chrslp: As soon as weed is federally legalized, so many leases marijuana clauses are going to be void LUL They all say "due to Federal law blah blah blah"

[1:49:59] zookiini: damn, the pretzels fuck you up

[1:50:41] Blistz1: what
[1:51:15] ceebz: the research looking back will be funny "since the US legalised cannabis, productivity reduced by 50%, but happiness increased by 15000%'
[1:51:22] chrslp: Damn Ive missed those
[1:52:55] Aravarth: @ceebz I mean, if the US legalises cannabis, I imagine productivity won't drop any worse than it does on account of alcohol being legal
[1:52:58] chrslp: If she gets distillate she can make a full infused meal without any weed taste

[2:12:49] Jermo11: LUL
[2:12:51] TheEnstraynomic: so the private server people are the wow equivalent of the sweaty smash melee players?

[2:16:42] rosina_scarlett: @bakurathewolf yes
[2:16:55] Kinghorn: LUL
[2:17:05] Kinghorn: I asked!
[2:17:18] drmabusee: hehe
[2:17:19] dahmuh: what're your feelings on the extensive tbc raid attunement system? yay or nay?
[2:17:43] Kinghorn: the attunement process is half the fun of TBC
[2:17:58] albertocofi: Ony was more annoying
[2:18:06] Neowanderer: i wish retail had attunements
[2:18:07] Kinghorn: yeah ony was busy work
[2:18:18] Vance: Attunement gives you a reason to actually play the game, and when friends get to cap then you get to play the game more
[2:18:25] Siddyy: people like BabyRage MAH ATTUNEMENTZ
[2:18:33] GodKingMuninn: After they did the ony attunement and I think the devs had to do it a second time on a char they were probs like 'yeah fuck that we aint making one like that again.'
[2:18:34] Kinghorn: yeah you get attuned, then you help other people get attuned
[2:18:41] Kinghorn: it keeps you doing dungeons
[2:18:52] skellymvncer: Attunements are just social quest chains to enter the raid imo
[2:18:57] Neowanderer: @Kinghorn agreed
[2:19:13] sussyrev: if attunements are easy to do, they are boring and just there to waste time
[2:19:17] Towelliee: !attunement
[2:19:17] Aravarth: Agreed.
[2:19:19] MXicanTroll: Get that Kara ammy
[2:19:21] Kinghorn: if I never have to do test of skulls again I will be a happy man
[2:19:21] Towelliee: !attune
[2:19:21] Moobot: @Towelliee TBC Attunement flowchart || https://imgur.com/t/raiding/ppyMF
[2:19:31] HotHotHeals: can't wait for those TBC store mounts
[2:19:36] Kinghorn: done it like 10 times at least in CHILL
[2:20:01] layercake2004: attunments in TBC were meant to prolong the expansion because they didnt know if wow would continue beyond it..but we all know now TBC is why wow is still going on til today..
[2:20:06] Austei: i remeber just getting it all done without realizing it back in the day
[2:20:21] AloneForNever: Plus being lvl 70 and going back and doing quests gets exta gold :D
[2:20:45] thegrt13: Also, doesn't the blue entry level PvP gear come from rep too?
[2:20:51] wadethewaters: @Towelliee watching you lvl a druid made me start to level one also. Thanks for the inspiration
[2:20:52] Kinghorn: now place the banner
[2:20:55] Vance: Why the hell to people see the TBC Classic collector's edition and think "yep this is the slippery slope to store mounts" like bruh we've had collector's editions since November 2004 bro chill.
[2:21:05] Austei: sporgar farming again lol
[2:21:05] HolyDaizy: its quite funny cuz the private server players are calling for #nochanges while they are sitting in p2w gear from the private server shop xd Sorry i just subbed so i could just send the msg by now<3
[2:21:05] Kinghorn: place the banner @Towelliee
[2:21:10] MXicanTroll: TBC is definitely needed for WotLK and somehow then it all began being streamlined
[2:21:11] wadethewaters: use the item
[2:21:11] Kale_Nd: place the banner @Towelliee
[2:21:14] wadethewaters: flag
[2:21:33] postboy710: the irony of this quest is that the scarlet crusade thinks everyone is scourge already
[2:22:07] TheEnstraynomic: i wonder if there was a private server that nerfed XP gains, just to make the game "harder"
[2:22:25] postboy710: REEEEEEE
[2:22:31] HolyDaizy: agreed. Its 2021 now, not 2007 :)
[2:22:39] wadethewaters: played on Private servers for 6 years, so many bugs, incorrect numbers for almost 100% of the content, it was mostly guessed and inaccurate
[2:22:41] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[2:22:44] HotHotHeals: im dead ass, i want all the mounts
[2:22:47] rosina_scarlett: aka Asmongold KEKW
[2:22:50] HotHotHeals: give me more
[2:22:54] Elementlolz1: :D
[2:23:08] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee  We've had in-game cosmetics for IRL money since the TGC came out. Just the only difference is a spectral tiger costs thousands and a store mount is only 25. :)
[2:23:09] oldmangamer0: :)
[2:23:09] postboy710: lot more than just asmon lol its prob more than half the classic community
[2:23:11] Elementlolz1: "its not part of the true BC exp" lolz :D
[2:23:21] steirerblut: yeah, toss blizz some money so we might get another retail xpac :D
[2:23:26] arrk___: is it going to be a limited time thing like it was in 2007
[2:23:40] layercake2004: what raid you looking forward to the most? SC, MH, BT, Gruul?
[2:23:40] Democritus33: @Towelliee whats "big big wow week" all about?
[2:23:51] Anthy1887: its just basic rage content to mage their communities happy
[2:24:05] GodKingMuninn: In-game rewards for IRL currency already existed in TBC, just all the people who whine about it are too dumb to realize it.
[2:24:13] postboy710: is that teebus??
[2:24:19] Hjolt: It's always the WoD music we sing along to Kappa
[2:24:23] Kromede: oh no https://twitter.com/WarcraftMeme/status/1388133549283364870/photo/1 MiniK
[2:24:27] steirerblut: all of it :D
[2:24:27] postboy710: str 2 ap
[2:24:30] wadethewaters: 1 str = 2 attack power
[2:24:30] maklayy: is it still fun for you to lvl in classic wow? or just gotta do it vibes
[2:25:06] Prideth: doesnt agi give 1 ap for war and crit?
[2:25:20] Kromede: survival KEKW
[2:25:27] Kaihrn: What happend in retail is happning in classic the toxic folk are slowly all ending up on a few servers at least here in the EU that is haha just like Kazzak EU
[2:25:28] HolyDaizy: ahh well. The WoW community has always something to blame or argue. I wish they done some changes to classic with the worldbuffs for example. Im sure more ppl would play classic if the world buffs werent a must for a raid.
[2:25:28] HyperChief: @Prideth Just crit and armor
[2:25:31] wadethewaters: no, wars only get AP from strength @Prideth
[2:25:35] layercake2004: ahh the days of duel wielding as a hunter..
[2:25:45] CrunkyBrewster: I leveled as Survival. It was of kind of fun
[2:26:00] Maroleb: LUL

[2:26:38] Vance: What're your thoughts after the 9.1 interview Preach did with Ion, Towelliee?
[2:26:48] Aravarth: I mean, they have to have that shit in TBCC because Bobby Kotick needs to have a reason to cancel him halving his bonus from $200MM to $100MM /s
[2:26:52] Batenasi: blizz should change survival back to what it was back in the days
[2:27:15] Batenasi: the same with outlaw rogue
[2:27:16] dracullus: same questions, same answers
[2:27:19] cineris_3: survival should be a new tank

[2:27:57] Blackhaxx: show them zombies who is the boss in the barn
[2:28:03] Hjolt: i dunno, i enjoyed surv in legion
[2:28:07] Hjolt: now tho...
[2:28:19] barnabeeprichard: I wish i could put it all in the toolbox and throw it all back together
[2:28:36] HolyDaizy: Maybe a silly question, but is Towelliee EU or NA?
[2:28:52] CrusaderNero: NA

[2:30:21] HolyDaizy: dont forget the META:p
[2:30:44] Osskssa: @Towelliee is your levelling bar at top a addon?
[2:31:03] Warjun11: they need a great story like ff
[2:31:08] hateful88: The rewards in Shadowlands just seem superficial with no weight to them
[2:31:25] xideontv: imagine doing 10/10 castle and only looting 1 piece of gear
[2:31:28] Aravarth: IMO that's likely why TBCC is gonna come out first -- Classic is 100% fanservice subscription retention
[2:31:33] HolyDaizy: Yea they are super late. We can blame the corona for it but they have millions and millions of dollars.
[2:31:36] GodKingMuninn: 9.1 isn't going to fix enough in order to bring peeps back long enough though... Think by 9.2 rolls around people will say fuck it until the next expansion
[2:32:22] Maroleb: hell give me gold for completing it
[2:32:23] Kromede: thx blizzard
[2:32:23] xideontv: torghast should drop gear like the major vision of nzoth
[2:32:25] HolyDaizy: Isle solo queue please
[2:32:25] cruzeal: islands gave mounts
[2:32:30] dracullus: worst thing is that people won't admit it when you ask directly, they will say titanforging and ap were shit
[2:32:31] amaaar314: lol
[2:32:34] CrusaderNero: meh I didnt mind IE. Atleast that was done quickly
[2:32:35] Neowanderer: oh hell no
[2:32:39] Rippan: yeah I was so hyped for torghast on the annoucement.. Sadge
[2:32:44] Aravarth: Islands gave mounts, pets, gear mogs, toys, etc
[2:32:48] Streamcrush: think it's worth coming back with the discounted xpac price?
[2:32:56] lithium364: im so tired of hearing they will fix things in at the last content patch in the expansion
[2:32:59] xideontv: the major vision of nzoth is more fun than torghast
[2:33:13] tillix_real: how the link work
[2:33:15] Warjun11: everyone always dislikes the side systems (garison, order hall , islands, torghast)
[2:33:16] Kromede: may be coming but sure we will not be doing dmg enough
[2:33:17] amaaar314: this is ptr?
[2:33:35] DoubleNova: it seems like they are always a step behind
[2:33:44] amaaar314: nvm am high
[2:33:50] Maroleb: I wonder when all the blizz devs will be able to head back to their studio
[2:33:56] Kinghorn: LUL
[2:33:59] maklayy: still enjoying levelling in classic?
[2:34:01] KillaFin: My favorite part of shadowlands is the part where they released the expansion without actually releasing the expansion because all the content is in blizzard soon development hell KEKWDISCO
[2:34:35] magecrimes: I saw they posted they had an internal vaccine site
[2:34:41] GodKingMuninn: I mean california has such a high rate of vaccination... They don't really have an excuse for why people aint back in office anymore.
[2:35:11] DoubleNova: their is a huge shift in at home working now
[2:35:19] HolyDaizy: Blizzard always has an excuse :P
[2:35:20] DukeBaphomet: ive dedicated too much time in the game. Im alrdy in it.
[2:35:43] Kromede: he said hunter and not huntard Kappa
[2:36:47] KillaFin: At home working won't be common place until the first minimum wage at home job becomes a thing IonJam ok IonJam time to program the automated mall system IonJam
[2:36:50] magecrimes: My guess is they start to transition people back into the office as they hit milestones, like TBC launch and 9.1 is out the door. Working in a similar but not video game related industry switching from wfh to office mid-project sucks.

[2:46:44] lithium364: great my server crashed
[2:46:51] TheEnstraynomic: he needed to cut his bonuses because blizzard was just one failure away from declaring bankruptcy LUL
[2:46:56] Maroleb: his salary cut means jack shit; he'll make boat loads off his other products and stocks
[2:46:59] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee  Thats why you get a niche degree. Find a college that will take you, manage to trick kids into taking your class for long enough to get tenure then kick back and relax.... Thus Liberal arts.
[2:47:05] KillaFin: nah bobby fires people regardless of success or failure, he's got to fool the investors somehow

[2:47:44] GodKingMuninn: He was the CEO since 1991... Activision still owned blizzard just not full merger then... So with peoples logic, he was responsible for TBC too.
[2:48:07] AllenzoTV: droolage LULW
[2:48:08] illuminationpaladincurse: @Towelliee when is prepatch
[2:48:33] magecrimes: Some of the youtubers and their logic is insane with Activision. I like to point to Bungie. A studio can make mistakes without it being a grand conspiracy.
[2:49:16] GodKingMuninn: @illuminationpaladincurse  a tuesday of this year. LUL
[2:49:48] GodKingMuninn: Turn in bone fragments into EPL for the ez 11k exp quest though?

[2:53:42] dracullus: @Towelliee end of the world is every 2 weeks in this community, no matter if expac is liked or not
[2:53:46] CrusaderNero: as consumers we are sadly part of the problem
[2:53:50] KillaFin: pretty sure that stuff happened when people realized that a nerd in his basement can make a better game than the trash that most triple A games can make KEKWDISCO
[2:54:00] a_joc: i wanna play this game when im retired and thats 40 years from now <3
[2:54:04] Maroleb: it won't even die this decade
[2:54:33] TheEnstraynomic: i wonder if the people that are whining at blizzard for every small thing is actually a shill for another company, i.e. Riot, Valve, or Ubisoft, and are getting paid to defame blizzard games LUL
[2:54:33] magakigr: they have what coming out?
[2:54:44] seaperz: so happy that people are quiting?
[2:55:17] maniac_nd: Because you have your own life, most people who act in the way you're describing have nothing going on
[2:55:21] KillaFin: The more people quit wow the more blizzard has to actually do their job EZ content update
[2:55:22] MontreyOG: Internet world does not crossover to reality
[2:55:46] smobeatz: ur in the basement now ? :p
[2:55:55] GodKingMuninn: Social media has given too many people's opinion a chance to be heard. And frankly peoples opinions are typically stupid.
[2:56:05] magecrimes: @TheEnstraynomic I mean, the thing that comes to mind for me with this is Bellular. They're an "indie developer" and it comes across like the dude has a chip on his shoulder.
[2:56:12] Blistz1: We are in a diferent age in the internet

[3:01:05] elandura: @Towelliee Ion saying "it won't be like WoD, there will be 9.2" was really bad, WoD had 6.2, didn't have 6.3... I mean how he said it with a straight face, I don't know.
[3:01:18] MontreyOG: what happened to blizzard, half baked expansions 2 times in a row now
[3:01:20] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:01:26] theszoti: ion didn't mention anything about post 9.2
[3:01:42] Anthy1887: my guess would be that they will do patches 1, 2 and 3 but maybe focus on raids / story and reduce previously planned world content around it? danHmm
[3:01:54] Austei: 9.4
[3:01:56] dracullus: we won't have idea until 9.2 PTR comes out
[3:01:57] mavis316: so you think 2 raids and a mini raid?
[3:02:03] GodKingMuninn: This expansion is so easy to go on for PATCHESSSSS, with the covenants
[3:02:26] Playwisme: doesnt surprise me ion wouldnt say anything on 9.3, i doubt thats even his decision to make. Thats probably a decision for his boss

[3:02:39] Kale_Nd: why not delay next xpac till 2023 ?
[3:02:44] magakigr: they only way to do it, is to delay the next expansion by a year but i don't think people gonna like that
[3:02:44] dracullus: @Towelliee most likely there will be also 9.1.5 with stuff like Legion timewalking

[3:04:39] dracullus: I don't know details, but doesn't they make patches and next expansion at same time? in that case if patch takes longer to make, new expac will as well @Towelliee
[3:04:53] playitday: hello all
[3:05:08] marshall_madness666: and alot of it
[3:05:10] Heeyou: yoooo
[3:05:28] OG_Carroll_4L: yep that's the one
[3:05:31] Blistz1: you think they started 10.0
[3:05:41] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:05:59] Eltreum: @Blistz1 they for sure got plans for 10.0 but unlikely any work was done
[3:06:02] Playwisme: it takes time to come up with that next hype feature, and then more time to figure out how to make it lackluster
[3:06:11] TheUnknowing: id assume that they are behind on development of the next expansion as well due to covid, so its either shadowlands needs to be cut short or it can go a full expac length (with 9.3) and the next expac just be 'delayed'
[3:06:19] gimpling_: 10.0 will be in design process
[3:06:28] Blistz1: I assume they got the brainstorm on 10.0 but are in the early stages of development
[3:06:37] Bigb0otymama: @Towelliee dont need to kill the elite
[3:06:49] lovecult85: jailor wins, everything is fucked up. patch 10.0 is 1000 years after that and we have a wow2 Kappa

[3:07:16] svitoski89: Poooound
[3:07:41] fooxytv: I‚Äôm surprised nothing has been leaked either
[3:07:49] Mattsta: was mid pull, I also think that 9.2 is the Jailer fight, but I think they need a 9.3 to be the connecting thread to 10.0
[3:07:50] Bigb0otymama: @Towelliee  stand to right corner or left of the tower entrance and use it

[3:10:19] mavis316: i have a vibe varian is coming back in the maw

[3:11:57] lithium364: survival hunter got buffs, im fine for the rest of the expansion, its all i could have asked for
[3:12:02] FlowtieBoi: Did you move?
[3:12:07] lithium364: pepehands

[3:13:20] elIlIie: hii
[3:13:21] Heeyou: lets win this ü•≥
[3:13:30] Playwisme: Is arthas still evil? he became bad after frostmourne ate his soul, so would his spirit in SL be bad?
[3:13:34] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:13:40] Broomba: @towelliee you should join up in asmons tbc arena tourney ;)
[3:13:44] Notwerk80: You think the king returns arthas
[3:13:48] BelovedTheFool: I left at the start of shadowlands and 9.1 has nothing in it that makes me want to return
[3:13:57] TheEnstraynomic: those people probably found new hobbies to kill their time, instead of video games
[3:14:00] jontrann: tbc out before 9.1? towlie leaked
[3:14:01] chrslp: When's the first Vegas trip coming, Towelliee?
[3:14:13] Jermo11: yeah i played SL for 2 weeks and burned out
[3:14:21] dracullus: @Towelliee remember there are millions that comes only for expac launch and are not interested in playing same game for months
[3:14:23] qtceef: feel like the only reason sylvannas is a raid boss is due to they know everything else is shit XD
[3:14:25] ShadoodHD: muh queen towQueen
[3:14:26] Hjolt: it will come down to it
[3:14:27] Hjolt: for sure
[3:14:34] geokouts: Arthas the Redeemer
[3:14:43] magakigr: they are hinting a lot of arthas lately
[3:14:43] dracullus: if Arthas come back in SL, it's already planned
[3:14:44] Jockulation: Arthas kills Sylvannas and redeems himself?
[3:14:50] ZiggiFTW: sucks bigtime they are killing best char in wow ... sylvanas
[3:15:20] Broomba: Arthas might not save SL. SL might not be saved
[3:15:20] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[3:15:20] Playwisme: that would be interesting. Bad arthas killed good sylvannas, now maybe good arthas kills bad sylvanas?
[3:15:28] cineris_3: legion was worse for that, everything was green
[3:15:31] dracullus: 8.1 looked like Zandalar, 7.1 looked like Suramar, 6.1 BRF looked like Iron Horde @Towelliee

[3:15:55] veryboredguy1: :(
[3:16:03] Hjolt: ye suramar was epic. one of the best aesthetic
[3:16:08] jontrann: legion was top tier shit bruh
[3:16:10] magakigr: i mean arthas is in the maw still, what if we find him inside the 9.1 raid?  maybe after sylvanas defeat?
[3:16:21] Jermo11: yeah legion was great
[3:16:25] Willdobbo: You leveling in prep for tbc?
[3:16:37] GodKingMuninn: Most of us just hated the disguise system... I laughed in rogue
[3:16:39] Hjolt: also suaramar's zone as a whole was cool. high level quest zone , with its storyline
[3:16:40] Aravarth: At least Suramar was pretty. The Maw is super fucking depressing and ugly.
[3:16:41] Gurtington_: I really loved suramars aesthetic
[3:16:42] Playwisme: maybe after wrath classic we can petition blizz for a legion classic
[3:16:48] Broomba: Losing causal player base and having a system not for them might be end of SL
[3:16:52] gravelzz: The raid itself looks good , but not the zone where its in
[3:16:59] dracullus: I don't like Maw but I think it looks cool
[3:17:06] Zelrise: people are just mad they cant mount. when they can they will like it. simple

[3:59:49] Jonnymapston: Is the boost already out ?
[4:00:10] GodKingMuninn: I'll only be able to carry in 2v2's
[4:00:16] Vance: Hahaha, I forgot you were a priest, I just remembered you had a 60.
[4:00:28] Aravarth: @Towelliee I figured it out for the craps table -- the numbers bet is called "Small (2,3,4,5,6), Tall (8,9,10,11,12), and All (all of them)", and you have to get them before a 7 hits when the point is on

[4:00:38] NovaSun84: enh shammy if prepatch, druid from 10-60 if not.
[4:00:47] Vance: Boost on pre-patch would be sweet, could pick up some loot before going into TBC
[4:01:10] Kale_Nd: I just hope the boost is not too expensive
[4:01:17] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:01:19] Aravarth: Guarantee it's $60
[4:01:21] Aravarth: the boost
[4:01:21] NovaSun84: Thoughts on bags for prepatch, 16 or naw
[4:01:38] HAUWNTED: $40 maybe

[4:01:40] GodKingMuninn: The surveys for it went out never showed 60$ as an option though.
[4:01:40] Ragi_Fz: I was very surprised to see a boost in the first place
[4:01:45] dracullus: haven't they datamined some bundle with mount, boost and game time?
[4:01:49] Vance: Didn't they have a survey asking what peeps thought about the price for the boost? I think $30 or $40 would be good since it's a once per account
[4:01:52] legobind: to skip 58 lvls in classic i would drop 100 on it
[4:02:06] Jockulation: $78 Australian for a boost..  Blizz can eat it
[4:02:09] meijer32: didn't they confirm a store with a mount in it for tbc
[4:02:10] Mattsta: I wouldn't even be surprised if the 58 boost is more than $60
[4:02:19] NovaSun84: Thoughts on bags for prepatch, 16 or naw
[4:02:21] TweakT: I hope its 140 dollars
[4:02:25] TweakT: or 300
[4:02:26] Chrisfo79: I fully expect it to be $60
[4:02:33] Vance: I could see the 58 boost being $40, or $60 to get the digital collector's
[4:02:34] Aravarth: IMO they don't make it more than $60, because past $60 it reaches the wince factor and people won't pay it
[4:02:43] sumerianrex: no dungeons blues, its goina be greens lesser than tbc greens i believe
[4:02:44] NovaSun84: LULW
[4:02:53] LamefootPete: as long as there are no item lootboxex for $, I dont care about the in game store tbh
[4:02:58] TweakT: so fewer ppl buy it :D
[4:03:07] Vance: In the screenshot they had a Tauren in the background getting boosted tho
[4:03:09] Kale_Nd: It does come with it
[4:03:19] illuminationpaladincurse: make 2 accounts easy :P
[4:03:28] Kale_Nd: there are 3 items: boots deluxe edition and deluxe edition with boost
[4:03:28] NovaSun84: I sold my idiot friend on retail, I'm fine for another 2 months LULW
[4:03:37] meijer32: I think they are removing that one time per account thing down the road

[4:04:05] Kale_Nd: there are 3 images, and you can see the bundle with the boost included
[4:04:14] NovaSun84: 58 collectors modcheck
[4:04:33] TheEktoplazm: Classic orcs are cooler than retail orcs imo
[4:04:41] NovaSun84: ^
[4:04:42] nihilistic_bat: might as well be free
[4:04:44] GodKingMuninn: GDKP raids are probs gonna pop off once the 58 boost is dropped. Gonna save those lockouts to make ez money
[4:04:52] illuminationpaladincurse: @cubertin  true
[4:05:02] Ragi_Fz: Is there any news yet by the way one when 9.1 will finally release?
[4:05:04] Ragi_Fz: on*

[4:05:36] Kale_Nd: the right image includes the boost image
[4:05:40] Democritus33: and how much is the deluxe ed ?
[4:05:48] dankmeliodas: I hope we get the toys on live too
[4:05:50] squirmyjay: assuming its just a ground mount?
[4:05:52] meijer32: those mounts tho
[4:06:19] Killingsmoke_ps4: 60 bucks to get all and 40 for boost only
[4:06:24] Arsannic: Didn¬¥t they say everyone will recieve 58 boots 1time for free ?
[4:06:31] Kale_Nd: no @Arsannic
[4:06:50] meijer32: there won't be a boost in that collectors edition
[4:06:54] CrusaderNero: dude its not going to be only 1 boost
[4:06:56] Vance: My guess is they do something like they did with the SL things, $40 for the mount and toys, $60 for the mount toys and boost. Or, $60/$80. I could be wrong tho, we'll see
[4:07:07] sumerianrex: LUL

[4:19:01] Tyrou: soulforges is just trash
[4:19:10] TweakT: u cant physically play 2 characters at the same time, that would only be good for bots
[4:19:10] Vance: Oh man, what a start
[4:19:13] SpoonManes: i need 3k more damn soul ash for my tempest of the lightbringer lego

[4:20:47] GodKingMuninn: Renewal?
[4:20:54] Nutqase: @Beyond_The_Invisible they was from a card game that you had to play in order to get the mounts?. So they whasen't really ptw mounts ?
[4:20:55] raymond3195: your night far use blink
[4:21:13] Vance: Did this good really just say that store mounts are ptw? LOL
[4:21:30] SpoonManes: i won bg cuz of my shiny mount yall
[4:21:35] GodKingMuninn: @Nutqase  Dude, what drugs are you on... And share please.
[4:21:42] Vance: Better mount better person, duh

[4:23:06] mickeymoose1738: @Towelliee you have a very cool and unique name "Growlliee" i would've never thought of any name like that LUL
[4:23:21] bruhSit_farmer: anima powers for m+ is going to cause a stir lol
[4:23:23] Ponickz: Redux09 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! good morning
[4:24:06] Nutqase: @Confused_Raven @Beyond_The_Invisible they still was from a card game, that was rarety, so it whasen't the same thing as a store mount system. You could still get them from the card game and not paying for them on ebay if you had the luck.
[4:25:13] Xedeffen: Do you still speak with Pokket at all?
[4:25:15] bruhSit_farmer: pre-patch tuesday you hear that bellular
[4:25:26] Shadowlemur01: I dont understand the hate for the in game store. As long as its just cosmetics/mounts/ level boosts i could give two fucks honestly
[4:25:26] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee can't wait to see you farming Sha once MOP Classic comes out
[4:25:41] GodKingMuninn: @Nutqase  But how does that make you win at the game and give you any form of competitive edge? How does it boost your stats?
[4:25:53] GodKingMuninn: You don't understand what P2W means
[4:25:57] cruzeal: lol
[4:25:59] Siechtum: is towelliee ok? he looks kinda sleepy today LUL
[4:26:10] SpoonManes: if anything blizz store is pay to look cool(P2LC)
[4:26:13] soth_klf: imagine getting the mount on your first try doing SHa
[4:26:33] KillaFin: MoP Classic? MoP is the best expansion if you want to "SLOW DOWN" KEKWDISCO
[4:26:33] sinlesssinner: are you hoarding soul ash for 9.1? is that why u are doing Torghast? @Towelliee
[4:27:27] raymond3195: seeing more havoc know with buff coming
[4:27:41] Nutqase: @Confused_Raven  they added a card game that was part of the lore and from that you was able to get a mount if you was lucky.

[4:28:35] RquesTR: did u guys talked about asmon's vid or am i bit too late on that train ? xD
[4:29:04] KillaFin: which asmon? mmo review? funny moments? ban reviews?
[4:29:08] GodKingMuninn: @Nutqase  That isn't pay to win. It doesn't give you any advantage over other players. I know about the TCG, but I don't think you're understanding what pay to win means. You're trying to hold an argument while having zero understanding of the topic. The equivalent of talking out your ass.
[4:29:10] ByteSmash: Ahhh gotcha, thanks for responding! Hope it's amazing!
[4:29:45] Nutqase: @Confused_Raven im having an argument that adding a store to tbc is wrong and have said nothing about pay to win
[4:30:11] SpoonManes: your high man, you literally said PTW earlier
[4:30:14] Vance: You did say that the store mount was ptw though, lol.
[4:30:35] cruzeal: you don't fail as a bear LUL
[4:30:44] rodemboo: i did torghast on a bear 174 ilvl all 8 layers with an int staff pre all nerfs

[4:31:08] Nutqase: @Confused_Raven i fail to understand from where that i have ever said that store mount is pay to win ?
[4:31:08] GodKingMuninn: @Nutqase You stated it about 10 minutes ago, albeit I'm assuming that wasn't your intention with your broken english?
[4:31:10] KillaFin: P2W, not P2W, who cares it's happening and nothing you do will change it cause GandalfPls US GandalfPls China GandalfPls lol astralia GandalfPls and parts of canada GandalfPls

[4:32:20] adrian_fell: wait, is there even a mount collection in tbc or do u get it in the mailbox on each char
[4:32:39] Freakzene: Mount price is nothing compared to the skill iirc
[4:32:47] raymond3195: classic dandy's never stop moaning
[4:32:47] GodKingMuninn: @Nutqase Your english is so broken so I think you were trying to convey a point that you weren't going for.
[4:32:48] Playwisme: 9 / 90 for normal / epic
[4:32:58] legobind: in bc its like 50g
[4:33:01] Dirty_Blades: Wild hunt
[4:33:01] Nutqase: @Vance that was about the tcg card game mount and not ptw ?
[4:33:05] derElten: riding cost a ton, mounts are a fraction of that
[4:33:08] SpoonManes: the skill yerp
[4:33:10] Dirty_Blades: for bm hunter
[4:33:17] Nutqase: @Confused_Raven you are pushing straw man at me
[4:33:18] Freakzene: You get to keep your classic gold in tbc anyway
[4:33:21] TheGoliath: whats the best covenant for BM hunter?
[4:33:21] rambo1156: its pay to lose your money xD

[4:33:39] Mr_Arms: winning my /spit in their face
[4:33:39] SpoonManes: lets see you define straw man then
[4:33:43] KillaFin: What people have justification in being mad is the fact that when players asked for some changes, it's not what they meant, They seen what "no changes" classic was like and they didn't want another classic andy situation and the store is about the only thing they are getting so far
[4:33:52] GodKingMuninn: Thats not even the expression.
[4:33:56] o0trees0o: y are  u in torghast x.x nooo

[4:38:20] PioneerOfSpaceflight: What pissed me off (as a returning player) is that i can't buy 1 month worth of game time anymore NotLikeThis
[4:38:20] raymond3195: think ian calling all players bad did not go down well
[4:38:28] fistofnature: Whats the druids name chat? :)

[4:39:17] Tyrou: it's true and i feel he just felt the need to be blunt for once lol
[4:39:25] Freakzene: Authentic classic/tbc experience simply isn't possible, with all the info we have now
[4:39:33] enthroned1: git gud? is this dark souls now?
[4:39:34] Mr_Arms: let them be mad it was clearly a joke
[4:39:35] forcegamerrr: I mean it was obviously a joke...
[4:39:35] Sarocus: If being told to git gud by Ion offends you, you probably need to git gud
[4:39:46] Coox69: i mean if it wasn't a joke it's still true tho
[4:39:48] KillaFin: @PioneerOfSpaceflight kinda it's just not called game time, cause you can't "buy" game time it's a weird thing
[4:39:51] Simajz: i have 20k+ hours on wow was hard endgame raider (realm first) back in cata and ye Ion was right
[4:39:59] quakegoogl: towHAMUP
[4:40:05] Crazdmadman: its was like his "we dont want you playing demonology" joke, it was pretty tone deaf
[4:40:15] Chrisfo79: @Freakzene Exactly this! It is impossible to recreate the feel because we live in a different time in terms of mmorpgs.
[4:40:17] KillaFin: @PioneerOfSpaceflight cause token > wow balance shenanigans
[4:40:21] PioneerOfSpaceflight: @Killafin @reffan I used to pay by mobile every month, but can't anymore :(

[4:45:33] Xarith: So if you think 9.1 will release in july when do you think tbc will launch?
[4:45:45] KillaFin: I think the issue with this expansion is that by july they are risking players just tuning out
[4:46:01] fistofnature: i joined a raid group stating "aoc only" and i got insta invited LUL

[4:51:58] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢
[4:52:10] KillaFin: The greatest joke is people always complaining about any online game launch being a trainwreck when 90% of them are always trainwrecks

[4:53:30] all_beef_franks: All eyes on you as a tank
[4:53:39] gooni_coyg: I like playing tank
[4:53:39] all_beef_franks: mistakes magnified
[4:53:41] dzwen: ye. on the other hand. ppl tend to blame the tank for almost everything, when something goes wrong.
[4:53:42] DHspeedy: i love tanking, but only pally and you know how much love they get
[4:53:55] KillaFin: ya that's called an oil fetish and that's TMI
[4:53:56] ryte1676: there is this overall pressure "tank must know everything about the dungeon" too many dps just want to mash keys and not pay attention, then the dungeon goes bad and its "shitty tank!"

[4:56:59] KillaFin: @ryte1676 because dps only want to kill the dragon, also I would rather have a push mechanic added for tanks so the group can guide the tank in the right direction in a hilarious manner since low mobility minus monk
[4:57:03] ryte1676: there is a WA for that.. its 68%$

[5:54:32] MrGattz: because the slot companies are giving streaming hundreds of thousands of dollars and not fully disclosing it to make it look better than it is @Towelliee
[5:54:37] PioneerOfSpaceflight: There's 8 hot tub streams going on at any given time. You're worried about kids and gambling? LUL

[5:58:54] quakegoogl: lol
[5:59:07] MrGattz: to be fair though, twitch rules and tos are "zero sexual content" and yet they are ok with hot tub streams that are literally sexual content and promotion for it. im not sure twich tos actually means anything anymore. so i guess anything is a go
[5:59:08] cptrogers123: Not only the gambling streams, but the hot tub streams are even worse man
[5:59:12] Malarick: agreed!
[5:59:25] marbas001: logic doesn't work on the internet anymore man lmao
[5:59:28] Zoidbergxxx: Hype could definitely have some influence over
[5:59:28] xJaeva: Twitch is not a babysitting service
[5:59:41] Shadowlemur01: too many people want government and other entities to raise their children. just pay attention to what they do its not difficult - signed a parent
[5:59:56] Exelcius: it's not only kids, like 90% of the viewers believe that the huge wins those streamers make are real and they believe they can win those also
[6:00:32] Lith0n: Exactly, kids are smart enough to find a way onto these things, up to the parents to wise them up
[6:00:48] Justarandomman: What stops them from just removing that content though, legal stuff? - I mean the hot tub crap @MrGattz
[6:01:09] Justarandomman: I went to bed, one streamer in hot tub, woke up she still in it with a 'friend' now
[6:01:10] Justarandomman: >.>
[6:01:26] MrGattz: @Justarandomman what stops twitch from removing it? nothing. they just choose not to regardless of their own rules for the platform
[6:01:27] NILLme: phantomlord was tweeting that he won a lawsuit against twitch about his ban (was banned for gambling?)
[6:01:30] DrakhanGaming: what classes can belfs be in tbc? i only know they cant be warriors apparently
[6:02:09] Shadowlemur01: omfg there are so many people in org on classic
[6:02:31] MrGattz: @DeNiLLx yeah he won the lawsuit. no one knows how but best guess is that twitch just gave him 40k and told him to fuck off. he was trying to sue twitch for $35m lol
[6:02:55] Justarandomman: 35mi?! i thought he only got 20k too
[6:03:02] MrGattz: oh maybe it was only 20k
[6:03:08] MrGattz: either way it was pocket lint money to twitch
[6:03:10] josh8555: ^
[6:03:16] TheUnknowing: You can take precautions but you never know who is behind the screen

[6:08:21] MrGattz: @Towelliee i think another big problem at least in the eyes of the views is that these websites *could be* increasing the win rate for the streamers without telling anyone. which comes back to the whole phantomlord shit. the drama is that the people that are educated on the past dont trust it and the people that dont know are being scammed thinking they can win big.

[6:18:09] MrGattz: @spaphytwitch i hope the wow mobile comes to switch to
[6:18:16] DrakhanGaming: did u get on trt because your t levels were lower than normal or were they in the normal range but on the lower side or was ur testosterone normal and u just got trt

[6:23:22] tiatan101: I wish pet battles in wow weren't as clunky as they are atm, they need some love IMO
[6:23:22] meijer32: it has to be something like the murloc rpg
[6:23:28] Jokervenom1978: Would it take 5 years to make a pet battle game?
[6:23:30] pkLeech: Warcraft GO‚Ñ¢

[6:26:27] CritcobainTV: @DrakhanGaming daaaamn 245 at 25? you're fucked. u bout to have a baby dick and no hair
[6:26:49] Terrine2xGras: I mean the fact that you log on to do your world quests and other things that are time gated gives me the feel a mobile game, of course there is a lot more to it than a real mobile game, just the general feel I'm not digging so much

[6:27:58] suzuya1189: Did you go through your doctor or a sperate clinic for your TRT
[6:28:04] DrakhanGaming: yeah kaiser says 240-899 is normal range and so i think they wont do anything for me because im 245
