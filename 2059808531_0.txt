[1:38:07] Mr_NeonCloud: Yeah we will be nerfed lmao
[1:38:11] OptimusPrimePleb: Smadge  we've gotten like 6 nerfs, leave us alone
[1:38:13] kirk_hunts: it is
[1:38:14] Mr_NeonCloud: 2 1h is best atm
[1:38:15] spacecowboyr: it is
[1:38:17] Mr_NeonCloud: For pve atleast
[1:38:18] spacecowboyr: its 30% more dmg
[1:38:21] kirk_hunts: YOu have to have two of the same weapon types
[1:38:23] secondfiddlejk: ya they did dual wield specialization
[1:38:29] terranapart: Probably use them as stat sticks
[1:38:30] kirk_hunts: yes both weapons raptor at same time
[1:38:35] mr_az3k: dual wield hunter is op rn
[1:38:37] Mr_NeonCloud: Like unless you have POD or something
[1:38:45] mr_az3k: 800 dmg crits with 1hs
[1:38:49] spacecowboyr: you deal 30% more dmg when you have 2 of the same weapon type + 30% from lone wolf and then you can stack another 30% from flanking
[1:38:52] Eetu79: i was with same lvl hunter im Bm and dualwield boi almost doupled my dmg BuddhaBar
[1:38:59] kirk_hunts: no it's instant now and both weapons raptor strike at the same time
[1:39:08] christiangodwarrior97: warriors have mastered all martial arts and are experts in close combat.... 2nd to hunters ppc
[1:39:13] kirk_hunts: and the ydo 30% more damage id you dual wield with 2 of the same weapons
[1:39:19] mr_az3k: and 1h is still better
[1:39:22] EulerGRJ: Also, Flanking has a chance to reset RT cooldown
[1:39:23] trickypork: flanking yep, and raptor resets flanking sometimes
[1:39:34] terranapart: stock up on mana pots, oils damn, spam as long as you have mana
[1:39:35] NovaKosova: Kalvish, Trill, Pika, Whazz... currently we have so many high level rogues its insane
[1:39:35] spacecowboyr: raptor strike resets on itself
[1:39:35] kirk_hunts: you're missing one piece of the puzzle
[1:39:36] mr_az3k: you strike with both  1hs
[1:39:39] trickypork: and flanking buffs raptor with a stacking self buff
[1:39:40] spacecowboyr: cause you're stacking % dmg on top
[1:39:44] kirk_hunts: nooo
[1:39:45] zenyabodhi: thought raptor resets raptor sometimes
[1:39:52] kirk_hunts: Both weapons raptor at the same time
[1:39:54] buffevoker: When does awc start
[1:40:03] spacecowboyr: and both weapons hit with it
[1:40:08] mr_az3k: ya
[1:40:08] kirk_hunts: YES
[1:40:12] kirk_hunts: it is insane
[1:40:17] trickypork: it's like STORMSTRIKE lmao
[1:40:18] spacecowboyr: both weapons count as seperate strikes for the flanking reset and the raptor strike chance to reset
[1:40:19] spacecowboyr: its insane
[1:40:19] trickypork: or mutilate
[1:40:23] kirk_hunts: It is the best thing ever
[1:40:25] suraxis: nerf hunters again
[1:40:39] Steveleeb: This is the problem with adding more raids. All people care about is dps so they are forced to add these boring +% damage runes and it leads to one shotting
[1:40:47] kirk_hunts: https://sod.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/2008#dataset=95
[1:40:50] kirk_hunts: look at that

[1:41:37] kirk_hunts: melee hutner is slamming
[1:41:52] weeedzygg: the problem right now is PvP is a joke , they gotta reduce damage done to players or so
[1:41:58] weeedzygg: cuz its just a one shot fiesta
[1:42:06] trickypork: that's busted
[1:42:12] terranapart: man, Ziqo always has the sickets music playing
[1:42:12] Gelnarx: are you planning to aoe farm till 40?
[1:42:18] spacecowboyr: yes each hit is a separate raptor strike
[1:42:20] spacecowboyr: the dps is insane
[1:42:24] kirk_hunts: It's the best everything atm
[1:42:40] spacecowboyr: every class is busted
[1:42:42] AfrochanXD: Tell me when thay dont nerf hunters XD
[1:42:43] OldManPetersen: absolutely crazy day for gaming

[1:43:00] trickypork: does trap launcher have a deadzone?
[1:43:01] wheeezyp: alot of people are just bad at mages
[1:43:04] terranapart: It's too early to say stuff is bad
[1:43:04] spacecowboyr: all the classes with instant huge hits are wreaking people cause hp is so low
[1:43:04] SnotBoogey: mage is not bad atm
[1:43:04] weeedzygg: @spacecowboyr the problem is the damage done to players
[1:43:05] alfontv: LUL
[1:43:16] fahrell29: !music

[1:43:34] SharmaJenkins: facts
[1:43:34] Ronafca: or lock
[1:43:36] Stinkyj555: not enough mage mains
[1:43:36] kirk_hunts: Mage is a little bricked because of the lack of stam gear this phase
[1:43:37] spacecowboyr: @weeedzygg at least now it's not a pet lol
[1:43:37] Methird: :D
[1:43:42] nexxerd: mage aint bad, just the ppl that play mages KEKW
[1:43:44] NovaKosova: i thought the smartest players are Hunters? Kappa

[1:43:47] AfrochanXD: stop the kapp
[1:43:47] whokilledmickeey: thank you ziqo, i needed this
[1:43:48] AfrochanXD: XD
[1:43:49] crunchynuts63: Rogue is 1 tier above mages tho
[1:43:53] weeedzygg: @spacecowboyr they gotta lower dmg done to players cuz we aint playing pvp no more its one tap clown fiesta
[1:43:53] ndras: mitch is mage too ur not making a case atm LUL
[1:43:53] spacecowboyr: the biggest issue is lone wolf imo. they buffed it and it's just gonna make no pet hunters crazy
