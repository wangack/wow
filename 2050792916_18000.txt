[5:16:33] 5L4Y3R: you say things like that
[5:16:38] relmo: why did graycen kick pop from the gang
[5:16:38] Trodenskjold: Cam and Pop would be great friends if it wasnt for you jackass
[5:16:40] 5L4Y3R: "cam is not in the wrong"
[5:16:41] Akompliss: I miss Lenny
[5:16:45] 5L4Y3R: so that's why popsocket left
[5:16:45] Lizzurdx: that alarm sucks
[5:16:46] crazyjoker961: pop is just emotional, he is in a gang not highschool
[5:16:47] 5L4Y3R: i would too

[5:17:02] fyisic: Well said
[5:17:03] pitviiper: Cam is the problem
[5:17:04] crucialhead: I feel like it's joever
[5:17:06] pretty_witch_boy: cam is like 70% wrong imo, also he's a grinder
[5:17:07] cuteturnipp: its hilarious how naive you are
[5:17:09] bamboniiii: W.e dude just embrace cam squad. Pop already off doin his own thing
[5:17:11] Anckael: Wants to be Dr Phil so hard he gonna start copying his hairstyle too

[5:17:30] Nightbot: My second channel is twitch.tv/definitelygraycen
[5:17:31] BUTHEDD_: His character is actually upset and thats what matters rn
[5:17:33] relmo: of course he's mad you just kicked him from the gang
[5:17:36] 5L4Y3R: or you are not listening at all
[5:17:37] Trodenskjold: Graycen is just about to cry chat. Be nice
[5:17:38] pitviiper: Cam being selfish is the root
[5:17:39] Lizzurdx: i missed it so idk wtf happened
[5:17:41] Thomsan04: cam standing on business and pop took it personally and then cam took THAT personally
[5:17:41] MasterPunn: did this jackass turn off tts
[5:17:44] DuckSmoke_: Cam is RPing alright, his character took control of the group and is using you to make him money.
[5:17:45] meathead_48: Gary thinks hes dr phil but deep throats cams dick
[5:17:47] starbaby888: miss your face cam 🥺
[5:17:49] bonziatv: @5L4Y3R NODDERS
[5:17:54] nPayn: lmaooooooo
[5:17:55] Kotodama1: So we can all agree its your fault then YEP

[5:18:04] 5L4Y3R: just poll: cam vs pop
[5:18:04] crucialhead: Poll
[5:18:07] 5L4Y3R: is it 50/50
[5:18:08] AlphaSimply: its Gang shit and he's not being listened to Madge
[5:18:09] 5L4Y3R: lets find out
[5:18:10] Kota216: holy shit Gary there is no changing ur mind on cam it’s clear
[5:18:10] starbaby888: @trodenskjold wtf??
[5:18:13] 5L4Y3R: democracy right?
[5:18:15] meathead_48: ICANT it isn't about the 1k
[5:18:15] relmo: this is mostly on gary. he only pretends to be a leader and can't fix this
[5:18:17] nPayn: it makes 0 sense
[5:18:20] AlphaSimply: CAM Squad
[5:18:22] Thomsan04: you dont NEED more than 1 grower rn
[5:18:24] Trodenskjold: @starbaby888 He might put his cam back on. Dont make him do that
[5:18:24] sleeplesswolf94: @Duck_Mallardly u realize how crazy that statement is when Cam and Fancy have put the most money out of anyone into the gang.......
[5:18:27] BUTHEDD_: poll it cam pop or 5050 at fault
[5:18:31] nPayn: exactly!!
[5:18:33] crucialhead: Run him over
[5:18:35] Thomsan04: especially since youre focusing on  your tang tang sells
[5:18:37] SwitchBord001: so could make money to put back in to the group funds and rai8se his rep...
[5:18:38] 5L4Y3R: popsocket is a pet of cam squad
[5:18:39] cuteturnipp: Dude has this explained to him like 20 times and still doesnt get it
[5:18:40] nPayn: he is a member and puts in work
[5:18:45] relmo: I'm heading to reddit if he keeps acting like this
[5:18:46] 5L4Y3R: he's pissed because he used to be a member of scam squad
[5:18:48] nPayn: if he asked for 1 band that’s nothing
[5:18:53] Kota216: the WHOLE issue is can said no to pops 1k cause group doesn’t need his weed. BUT the group is cool with giving cam 6k for his own house. RIDDLE me that greycen.
[5:18:53] pretty_witch_boy: @relmo D:
[5:18:59] 5L4Y3R: i would leave too getting cucked that hard ngl
[5:19:01] pitviiper: Cam is bitching over 1k that will help the group grow. because he feels like its his money. That is being selfish
[5:19:09] crazyjoker961: guys u need to understand this is not highschool, he is in a gang not highschool, he need to get over things up and stand up
[5:19:13] Slyzer: this drip tho
[5:19:13] Akompliss: You realize you can't fence sit forever, right?/
[5:19:13] relmo: @relmo graycen needs another hate thread. I don't make the rules
[5:19:16] Slyzer: ICANT
[5:19:16] 5L4Y3R: it's never been about the money it's about how cam acts as the new leader of the gang
[5:19:19] crucialhead: Cam is a selfish bitch
[5:19:19] DuckSmoke_: @sleeplesswolf94 Oh geez, you mean the grinders had the most money to put into a money making operation? WOW!
[5:19:20] Thomsan04: pop also said he threw 1k away to some guy just for chilling with him for  a couple hours. like just dont give away money
[5:19:22] BerkTheLUL: pocket sock kinda being a victim andy
[5:19:34] Trodenskjold: @Akompliss Graycen is an expert of sitting on hard things like fences
[5:19:45] demindrela123: ITS NOT ABOUT THE 1K
[5:19:47] pretty_witch_boy: he said he would give him the 1k after spitting in his face lol
[5:19:48] RossTheBoss__: hey Graycen can I have 1k
[5:19:49] SwitchBord001: Principal.
[5:19:55] 5L4Y3R: yeah i'm glad popsocket left
[5:19:56] Kota216: it’s not about the 1k grey
[5:19:59] 5L4Y3R: it's the best thing he could do
[5:19:59] relmo: you just told him he's out and kicked him
[5:19:59] Kota216: you are dumb
[5:19:59] meathead_48: ICANT bro thinks its about the 1k
[5:20:01] Trodenskjold: Graycen still thinking its about the 1k
[5:20:01] WarrenPuffit: this guys actually brain dead
[5:20:03] Drexnaaul: also taking you shit and leaving doesnt help popsockets argument
[5:20:04] nPayn: nah, no way cam said it should be a democracy and then acts like a leader
[5:20:05] BUTHEDD_: SAJ the fact that its like this at all
[5:20:07] 5L4Y3R: i'm just wondering what you will do for a week before you leave rp forever
[5:20:13] bonziatv: xdd
[5:20:15] Kota216: you are dumb greyceb it’s clear
[5:20:18] demindrela123: CAM SUCKS
[5:20:18] 5L4Y3R: you have to be trolling
[5:20:18] cuteturnipp: ICANT
[5:20:23] nPayn: you have no idea how happy cam is when pop said he was leaving
[5:20:24] crucialhead: Cam is a wannabe Lang Buddah and Scam Squad was never about that
[5:20:24] 5L4Y3R: trying to follow your logic is like being on shrooms
[5:20:26] 5L4Y3R: no joke
[5:20:29] DuckSmoke_: That's not how principals work....
[5:20:31] demindrela123: PRINCIPLE ALWAYS MATTERS
[5:20:36] Akompliss: It's about Cam literally taking over and controlling everything
[5:20:37] cuteturnipp: Sometimes I wish I was this dumb
[5:20:39] pretty_witch_boy: cam rubbing his hands together like an evil villain over pop leaving
[5:20:43] Akompliss: The grinder
[5:20:45] relmo: this is just graycen blowing the gang up before SOD P2. kinda fucked up tbh
[5:20:45] 5L4Y3R: 10/10 mental gymnastics
[5:20:46] AlphaSimply: its personality clashing it sounds like xdd CAM Squad
[5:20:47] SwitchBord001: Cam was so dismissive of any effort Pop puts in.
[5:20:49] pitviiper: Id leave too  after being treated like that from Cam
[5:20:53] Anckael: Why everytime I join a gta rp stream there's always some childish drama going on?

[5:20:58] Lizzurdx: they dont
[5:21:01] Kota216: NO THE issue IS. CAm wants money for HIS OWN SHIT. and you gobble that and see cool. but pop can’t have 1k for his weed rep.
[5:21:02] meathead_48: xdd cam squad
[5:21:03] 5L4Y3R: that's INSANE you keep saying it's miscommunication
[5:21:03] Kotodama1: well it doesnt matter now. Popsocket is done with the group SAJ
[5:21:07] bonziatv: i also like making up facts
[5:21:09] Trodenskjold: @Anckael Childrens game
[5:21:09] BUTHEDD_: SAJ POP
[5:21:16] WarrenPuffit: cam squad woohoo
[5:21:18] Trodenskjold: We understand alot more than you jackass
[5:21:20] DuckSmoke_: Everyone agreed it would be a democracy and everyone would get a say, but that's not what's happening.
[5:21:21] Yasi1337: Alright just assume we are stupid jackass
[5:21:21] Thomsan04: cam said gang money should be allocated with  EVERYONE agreeing to it. not just 1 or 2 people saying its a good idea.
[5:21:21] 5L4Y3R: yeah they bought scam squad
[5:21:22] pitviiper: CAM SQUAD o7
[5:21:24] relmo: I'm willing to admit I don't understand why you kicked pop from the gang
[5:21:25] 5L4Y3R: so they can do what they want
[5:21:26] yomawma: YAPPING
[5:21:27] fyisic: Chat is invested. Love it
[5:21:28] 5L4Y3R: but you don't have to stay
[5:21:28] crucialhead: You won't even be playing in a week you dumb fuck. Think of Popsocket
[5:21:31] demindrela123: its all they care about
[5:21:34] 5L4Y3R: i clearly get that
[5:21:35] sleeplesswolf94: woahwoah Graycen careful with that statement chat will just say they are grinders so it doesnt matter
[5:21:36] demindrela123: thats why popsocket is leaving
[5:21:36] cuteturnipp: that's not the point either
[5:21:39] caleb_thewhitehand: are u trauma dumping on us now? @Graycen
[5:21:39] cdman_77: money doesn't buy power
[5:21:44] Akompliss: @Graycen Did you see the Phase 2 runes they datamined from the PTR?
[5:21:52] BUTHEDD_: even if they put more money they were saying the gang has to be about group decisions before lenny left now they are saying they make the decision
[5:21:53] sleeplesswolf94: @cdman_77 money 100% does buy power in a gang. dumb af comment NEXT
[5:21:58] DuckSmoke_: It doesn't matter how much they put in, that was their choice, that doesn't mean they should just get to control what the group does.
[5:21:58] 5L4Y3R: if you want to stay in cam squad i don't hold it against you tbh i just think it's insane you can keep acting like you're fence sitting
[5:22:02] meathead_48: ICANT isnt popsocket your weed grower? in the long cam and fancy dont mean shit
[5:22:03] 5L4Y3R: you have clearly chosen a side
[5:22:08] joseh23: that shouldnt matter pop isnt taking the money for personal gain also since they put in more money are they the leaders now?
[5:22:12] ImpendingAgony: None of this matters. You're out of the gang irl in 6 days anyway
[5:22:16] AlphaSimply: Madge bc they play GTA 15 hours a day xd
[5:22:24] Trodenskjold: @meathead_48 He is quitting rp in 1 week anyway
[5:22:24] relmo: graycen knows he's done here in a week and is just taking everyone down with him before he goes
[5:22:25] pitviiper: o7 Pop o7
[5:22:28] IMasturnate: the first rule you guys had in the group was for everyone to be heard I don’t think pop has been heard once today
[5:22:30] meathead_48: @meathead_48 YEP true
[5:22:30] 5L4Y3R: that's all popsocket wanted to hear was are you trolling is this rP
[5:22:31] bamboniiii: So because yall were banned you're gonna let cam and fancy ego trip yall? Yea the rp life for @graycen and the gang is a wrap
[5:22:31] ImpendingAgony: wowisbackbaby
[5:22:34] 5L4Y3R: and you said 50/50
[5:22:35] 5L4Y3R: KEKG
[5:22:38] 5L4Y3R: so yeah he's gone
[5:22:41] crucialhead: @imasturnate exactly
[5:22:42] BUTHEDD_: Theres no avenue to rp if its all about GANGSTER ACTIVITIES and maxing out money all day too
[5:22:51] relmo: calm down graycen please
[5:22:52] 5L4Y3R: THE 1k
[5:22:53] pretty_witch_boy: poll it :)
[5:22:55] Thomsan04: its a smart decision to say the people that put in the most money get paid back first. if  popsocket put in a fuck ton of money im sure they'd be more inclined to give him 1k on a whim
[5:22:57] 5L4Y3R: ok ur right
[5:22:57] Trodenskjold: Im impressed that you managed to completely fuck up the gang before phase 2 is out
[5:23:01] 5L4Y3R: i just realized gary ur right
[5:23:06] WarrenPuffit: cope buddy
[5:23:10] 5L4Y3R: W cam squad
[5:23:11] 5L4Y3R: C
[5:23:13] caleb_thewhitehand: its not about the 1k its about how much say i get for the money i put in @Graycen
[5:23:14] SylvrOne: how would it be 50/50, if Cam SAID he would give Pop 1k and never did
[5:23:26] Kotodama1: only 1 original scam squad member left SAJ Cam Squad
[5:23:30] cdman_77: @sleeplesswolf94 giving money to a group is contributing it doesn't mean anything else
[5:23:31] Naboo69: cause he invested it all into growing so he didnt ask for money
[5:23:35] meathead_48: OMEGADANCE AINT NO FUCKING WAY
[5:23:38] AlphaSimply: Rip Pop Sadge he deserved to be leader tbh
[5:23:41] Parcelazo: wasting the money on strippers peepoSad
[5:23:43] 5L4Y3R: lmfaoo
[5:23:43] fyisic: YEP
[5:23:45] cuteturnipp: ICANT
[5:23:47] doofeeneed: NO OFFICER
[5:23:47] Naboo69: om om
[5:23:49] doofeeneed: COME BACK
[5:23:49] sleeplesswolf94: @cdman_77 yea sorry but no.
[5:23:50] BUTHEDD_: om
[5:23:55] nPayn: I bet cam said the gang can’t be called Scam Squad anymore ok
[5:23:57] 5L4Y3R: om
[5:23:59] Trodenskjold: @Parcelazo That aint a waste tho
[5:24:04] crazyjoker961: lol yeah u were like 1 step from being ****ed
[5:24:04] doofeeneed: COME BACK Prayge
[5:24:09] PAID_ACTOR1: chat is he in a new gang yet? sorry had to pause for a few minutes
[5:24:09] DuckSmoke_: Putting in your personal money is a personal choice, the money made is for the group as a whole.
[5:24:14] BUTHEDD_: @nPayn yesterday gary said they should keep the name and he blew up
[5:24:17] 5L4Y3R: @nPayn cam squad* please stop deadnaming the gang
[5:24:19] pretty_witch_boy: you have to kill that car, it's the only way forward
[5:24:20] relmo: same
[5:24:23] crucialhead: @npayn he did, he said we need to change the name asap
[5:24:25] Kotodama1: @PAID_ACTOR1 nah he staying as a loyal soldier for Cam
[5:24:31] Parcelazo: @Parcelazo Smadge then why they say the same cute things to other men
[5:24:32] nPayn: LMAOO OMFGG
[5:24:33] SylvrOne: @graycen are you going to quit rp now that your “gang” has disbanded?
[5:24:36] Trodenskjold: Yo Graycen could you find a spot with more car alarms going off
[5:24:38] PAID_ACTOR1: @Kotodama1 my grinder FeelsStrongMan
[5:24:57] Marks0nn: so did the local drug dealer make any money for you guys ?
[5:25:02] masteroogwayx21: @npayn i thought they changed their name as reddit and Buddha trolled them.
[5:25:04] IMasturnate: L gary and a bigger L graycen
[5:25:04] Thomsan04: their personal money bought them the house, the computer rig, the washers, the stuff for the weed. obviously you pay that back in good faith.
[5:25:08] bamboniiii: For real all the OGs are out. Chat fuckn hates cam lol what now @graycen
[5:25:09] Trodenskjold: You did this Gary
[5:25:10] Parcelazo: Applecatrun
[5:25:11] relmo: you just wanted it to look like someone else killed the gang when it was you
[5:25:12] BUTHEDD_: u somehow fucked it harder om
[5:25:13] KidZunagi: kick the other guy out and keep PopSocket in
[5:25:13] Naboo69: @Duck_Mallardly that money getting put in as a group is an investment too, cam kinda make it out like buttcoin isn't gonna equal profit at some point
[5:25:18] faime_: gawy gawy gawy gawy gupper guppers
[5:25:19] crucialhead: Why don't you just join Nick's crew! They have about 12 racks
[5:25:20] 5L4Y3R: yeah it's heat of the moment
[5:25:22] BerkTheLUL: being the victim andy

[5:25:49] Parcelazo: you scammed us with the gupcoin so is normal to scam people on gta SCAM SQUAD SPERGING
[5:25:50] crazyjoker961: he is 100% emotional from day 1, he need to understand that sht will not work like this, this a gang not school
[5:25:51] sleeplesswolf94: chat scares me with their logic on this "who cares if he gave the most money" is just wild.  the ppl that invest the most in ANYTHING get the say at the end of the day. just cause u putting in crumbs does not put u on the same lvl as the rest.
[5:25:52] relmo: self insert victim andy killed his gang and avoiding blame

[5:26:10] PAID_ACTOR1: @relmo om
[5:26:14] nPayn: it’s insane how cam got more and more comfortable with taking control, at first he wasn’t not even so bold or decisive
[5:26:28] 5L4Y3R: yeah it's been a character development for cam
[5:26:29] PAID_ACTOR1: @sleeplesswolf94 bro he living rent free in that house om

[5:26:50] meathead_48: lost lenny for this Sadge
[5:26:51] Kotodama1: even your weed jobs leaving you SAJ
[5:26:54] sleeplesswolf94: @5L4Y3R sorry u dont understand how a business works that wants to make money and not throw it away kekw
[5:27:04] Trodenskjold: Thanks for finding more car alarms to stand around Gary
[5:27:06] PAID_ACTOR1: @5L4Y3R he just has to say it infront of a mirror a few times before dicking these people down
[5:27:08] crucialhead: I'm pretty sure Cam was the one who got Lenny banned!
[5:27:09] Trodenskjold: Fucking jackass
[5:27:09] SylvrOne: What happened to Lenny chat?
[5:27:13] 5L4Y3R: @5L4Y3R sorry you are a fucking grinder in a VIDEO GAME and hate content
[5:27:15] Potato_Masha_NZ: @SylvrOne BAND
[5:27:16] AlphaSimply: Gary "was" co owner i thought
[5:27:16] Marks0nn: Gary and Lenny will always be the founders!
[5:27:19] Trodenskjold: @SylvrOne Gary happened
[5:27:21] BUTHEDD_: almost got shiestied

[5:27:35] 5L4Y3R: @geffres 100p
[5:27:40] DuckSmoke_: @sleeplesswolf94 That wasn't the dynamic they agreed upon. It was supposed to be equal say for the core group and people could put in whatever they wanted. There was never an agreement that more money would give you more authority.
[5:27:46] SylvrOne: @potato_masha_nz Perma?
[5:27:48] 5L4Y3R: gary out of whatever squad regardless in 6 days om
[5:27:51] pretty_witch_boy: grinder cam
[5:27:59] Potato_Masha_NZ: @SylvrOne yeah.. all scam squad got various bans SAJ
[5:28:02] Naboo69: @sleeplesswolf94 If i drop 25 racks on the development of a business, I'm not expecting my homies to pay me back. Im expecting that business to make profit and pay me back.
[5:28:03] nPayn: Grindr cam
[5:28:04] ImpendingAgony: @5L4Y3R 100%
[5:28:10] doofeeneed: man that cop was the biggest blue ball ever
[5:28:11] sleeplesswolf94: @Duck_Mallardly that was when Lenny was around. Lenny is gone. things have changed.  ADAPT or get left behind.
[5:28:12] 5L4Y3R: @sleeplesswolf94 no you don't understand, that was LENNY's vision for SCAMSQUAD
[5:28:14] SylvrOne: @potato_masha_nz oof
[5:28:18] 5L4Y3R: gary did not carry on lenny's legacy
[5:28:29] Thomsan04: @sleeplesswolf94 cam said if they gang was all online and everyone said he could have the money to do whatever, it would be fine. not just popsocket talking to 1 or 2 people and saying give me money
[5:28:29] doofeeneed: they just need to kick out gary
[5:28:29] nPayn: damn no more Scam Squad rip
[5:28:29] 5L4Y3R: now cam has created CAM SQUAD from the ashes
[5:28:32] Parcelazo: @sleeplesswolf94 the rules were not clear, his dick is now stuck in a door PeepoGlad
[5:28:32] crucialhead: @5l4y3r so disappointing
[5:28:35] 5L4Y3R: this is a totally different group
[5:28:38] DuckSmoke_: @sleeplesswolf94 When Lenny left is when they agreed on a full democracy OMEGALUL
[5:28:42] Kotodama1: Cam Squad has risen HandsUp
[5:28:48] pitviiper: Cams the bigger man obviously
[5:28:50] Trodenskjold: @5L4Y3R ofcourse not. No one respects Gary, ofcourse he cant lead the gang
[5:28:53] 5L4Y3R: @Duck_Mallardly KEKG yep
[5:29:00] BUTHEDD_: Kappa
[5:29:05] Thomsan04: BASED
[5:29:07] nPayn: lmao he’s such a manipulator
[5:29:08] 5L4Y3R: hahaha he's been reading chat
[5:29:10] 5L4Y3R: @CannaCasual
[5:29:19] 5L4Y3R: Kiss
[5:29:26] bamboniiii: For real all the OGs are out. Chat fuckn hates cam lol what now @graycen
[5:29:36] bergzminuspickles: classic narcissistic behaviour
[5:29:36] 5L4Y3R: sorry im just trying to pump up the views with a little spice
[5:29:41] 5L4Y3R: PEPW
[5:29:44] IMasturnate: here we go again let’s make min maxing the main goal
[5:29:44] Thomsan04: cam just focused on the money and disseminating it fairly. money moves.
[5:29:47] pretty_cool_guy: HUH
[5:29:47] Naboo69: we aren't RP frogs here, just graycen hate watchers chat, keep it that way OK
[5:29:51] 5L4Y3R: that was the best thing i've ever seen
[5:29:52] not_grieves: I'm not a RP viewer but the few times I did pop in, you sucked at RP bro. Not surprised you got banned tbh still sorry it happened tho
[5:29:54] DuckSmoke_: Did this guy just actually call Archie a homie???
[5:29:54] jazzmaggot: nah i dont hate cam too much now, hes a realist KEKW
[5:29:56] 5L4Y3R: when he wrenched archie
[5:29:59] wowitspeter: CAM SQUAD AAAA
[5:30:01] 5L4Y3R: counted to 3 in literally 2 seconds
[5:30:07] 5L4Y3R: fastest count i've ever heard
[5:30:13] meathead_48: HDMI cant sit still longer than 2 minutes
[5:30:22] 5L4Y3R: yeah archie is a real one for not calling the cops
[5:30:23] PAID_ACTOR1: @not_grieves bro youre 2 days early on that message
[5:30:26] wowitspeter: SAJ i miss popsocket already SAJ
[5:30:27] Marks0nn: Don’t want the gang to micromanage too much where it stops people from doing things they want or be questioned for everything
[5:30:31] 5L4Y3R: he had the flag om
[5:30:45] AlphaSimply: RP Frogs om this is why
[5:30:50] crazyjoker961: u stopped selling
[5:30:50] Thomsan04: archie cant call the cops. he trespassed in his house.
[5:30:53] wowitspeter: om
[5:30:57] 5L4Y3R: om
[5:31:01] wowitspeter: Graycen the mediator KEKW
[5:31:08] crucialhead: I'm making a reddit thread about this
[5:31:09] 5L4Y3R: @Thomsan04 it's not texas
[5:31:12] nPayn: can’t believe Gary not a leader
[5:31:12] 5L4Y3R: om
[5:31:16] sleeplesswolf94: @Duck_Mallardly and the 2 who have invested the most share the same opinion on where the money goes. Pop doesnt and Gary is in between. do the math.
[5:31:17] bamboniiii: Low key Cameron is happy af. Ggs @graycen your squad is officially disbanded. And Cameron is the new CEO
[5:31:18] ImpendingAgony: @wowitspeter How's that working  out?
[5:31:23] pitviiper: Cam wont let pop talk why would pop try to talk to him
[5:31:26] DuckSmoke_: "We come on terms" = "I convince you I'm right because you're dumb."
[5:31:27] Kotodama1: @bamboniiii LUL
[5:31:30] 5L4Y3R: KEKG

[5:32:07] Thedruidtyler: why would mccool watch you at 9 am
[5:32:08] DuckSmoke_: @sleeplesswolf94 Fancy said Pop could have the 1k, then a phone call with V changed that. 🤔
[5:32:09] crucialhead: He's gone, he was disgusted
[5:32:15] 5L4Y3R: he's in chat but he's not listening
[5:32:16] SwitchBord001: Just beat down locals and rp that LUL

[5:33:08] 5L4Y3R: graycen you are the last member of the group formerly known as scam squad
[5:33:10] meathead_48: ICANT doesnt even know his own turf
[5:33:21] Thomsan04: lenny and steven are back in less than a month if they want. pop is choosing to leave.
[5:33:24] Higgs22: @crazyjoker961 true

[5:33:43] 5L4Y3R: @Thomsan04 100% go find a bench gary
[5:33:46] Drexnaaul: And you'll be gone too in a few days
[5:33:48] 5L4Y3R: you'll find a new squad soon enough
[5:33:48] DuckSmoke_: I would honestly love to see Lenny come back and take control again, Cam would lose his shit.
[5:33:50] demindrela123: @Thomsan04 i am sure pop will join if they come back
[5:34:04] 5L4Y3R: @Thomsan04 lenny is chosing to leave, he's not even gonna appeal i don't think
[5:34:09] bamboniiii: It's alright guys.. we can always go back and watch the vods when @graycen had a squad that he controlled with his lil pp energy. Until a new regime took over and called themselves Camsquad
[5:34:12] nPayn: yeah I missed when Lenny was leader he didn’t have any ulterior motives
[5:34:14] crucialhead: I hope Lenny's appeal is upheld
[5:34:20] 5L4Y3R: yeah lenny was a good leader
[5:34:26] crazyjoker961: i think u should just call him and tell him to leave growing and just sell with u
[5:34:30] 5L4Y3R: he wasn't trying to buy his own house seperately the whole time
[5:34:31] jazzmaggot: just leave the squad and become an intern at the company LUL
