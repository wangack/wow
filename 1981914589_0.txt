[2:49:31] Molehj: @Killx202 imagine
[2:49:40] fNandow: @bantuatha it's recommended you do dungeon around your lvl. lower lvl dgs will reward you less xp and not good gear anymore. it'd be a waste of time

[4:17:39] ElusiveOne_: danUgly never looked better @SekretAznMan
[4:17:41] altie1: The thing with ff14 is that most players only hop in when new content arrives. They don't have to play all year through to 'keep up'. Something to keep in mind.
[4:17:41] DrWraithjr: Warframe should be on that list at 700k

[4:18:35] fruitvendorx: @KeyKnight Oh I know, I've cleared savage up to the end of Eden and ran UCOB/UWU/TEA. FF14 is boring as fuck because it doesn't have enough content
[4:18:35] Kennaay: I know plenty of people that play Classic but not Retail, and vice versa
[4:18:43] jediknight223: XIV loses subs between content which the director is ok with. He doesn't want you to constantly play XIV and play other games too.

[4:19:40] WhiskyThunder: "Releasing Subscriptions no longer aligned with there core marketing strategy"
[4:19:42] Zakaluka15: I hope they do progression servers sometime
[4:19:42] ValiantLoki: Cataclysm's changes to how leveling worked is what stopped me playing

[4:19:45] Kefka_did_nothing_wrong: also, lots of online games snatched away players, like LoL etc

[4:20:02] fruitvendorx: @KeyKnight A simple system similar to M+ in WoW would go a loooong way. And the new criterion dungeons are definitely NOT it

[4:20:45] NBK_Sethus: tbh those 3 'expansions' sound like 3 patches of a single expansion
[4:20:49] Puddleink: pvp filled that hole, but then you had to have pvp and pve armor. That was too much time
[4:20:52] Lionkingler1: hope they dont charge 90€ for each year tho KEKW

[5:05:16] Skipitin: I do not remember the lore fromn Warcraft 3 well enough nor do I know any of wow lore
[5:05:44] altie1: No wait, it was Xavius danHmm
[5:05:53] Killx202: and elves are just weird looking trolls
[5:06:14] jediknight223: The War of the Ancients trilogy are some of the best WoW novels.
[5:06:16] KeyKnight: @Skipitin  sounds like a typical dark souls experience where almost no one knows the lore XD
[5:06:49] malkious: Stranglethorn beast quest finish has a good blue rifle at end i think
[5:06:51] Skipitin: What has happened in mainline wow lore since Lich King? I suppose the game followed Warcraft 3 lore till that point?
[5:07:00] SekretAznMan: Jebaited
[5:07:02] Grid1010: danEvil
[5:07:04] Toon11: Foooled YOu
[5:07:06] Vesper_Knight: Iirc elves themself are trolls transformed by the influence of Elune or something. Although that might be a crack theory
[5:07:06] oblivionnight: Nice progress, Dan!
[5:07:20] altie1: Made me look, almost whiplashed my neck
[5:07:23] FrodoFraggins: Garrosh happened
[5:07:40] Cyrianix: He was in Warcraft 2
[5:07:41] tO_Ot: @DansGaming haha nice one dan, your always so hilarious! never any puns in this channel! ... :(
[5:07:41] FrodoFraggins: deathwing then garrosh then angry sylvanas
[5:07:43] KunoVanOyten: danNotes
[5:07:50] Holdthepickle629: Deathwing was from 2 I think
[5:07:52] Lionkingler1: post wrath as always one big bad that got defeated within that expansion
[5:07:53] jediknight223: Deathwing was a big part of the War of the Ancients.
[5:07:56] Killx202: and mist of pandara was just about saving panadas
[5:07:58] Mavmike82: Sad to say but peak Warcraft story was WC3
[5:08:00] Machian: deathwing was a unit in warcraft 2
[5:08:00] fluffydelusions: Dan what's you 2023 goty?
[5:08:05] woodentable: @Vesper_Knight the well of eternity si what changed them
[5:08:08] jediknight223: Deathwing was from Warcraft II.
[5:08:08] fNandow: Aware then sylvanas happened
[5:08:09] Skipitin: @KeyKnight Dark Souls seems interesting but the gameplay was too console/controller designer for my taste. Heard good things about those games though. Lore being "Piece it together if you want" type
[5:08:19] thekudobeast: Aware

[5:08:36] ZanRebel: NotLikeThis
[5:08:37] Cliffhoof: Deforged
[5:08:39] Lionkingler1: MoP was garrosh, WoD was timetravel, legion was the legion guys
[5:08:40] Strix2206: warcraft 3 is amazing
[5:08:46] endorphinist: they pulled it off they really did the least
[5:08:47] Kabbit_99: Chat, which expansion introduced death knight?
[5:08:47] jediknight223: You only learned of Pandaria from Chen Stormstout in Warcraft III.

[5:09:07] FightinFalcn: ive heard that fans "finished" WC3 reforge in a mod
[5:09:08] Kefka_did_nothing_wrong: it was the best demake that year
[5:09:15] Skipitin: I have heard good things about new Diablo 2 but very bad things about Warcraft 3
[5:09:19] amarney: WC3 reforged was aa Gollum-like before Gollum
[5:09:24] KunoVanOyten: warcraft 3 + frozen throne is one of the best games ever made
[5:09:26] fluffydelusions: Can't wait for new PoE 2.0
[5:09:26] Zinaroth: D2R was a gem
[5:09:29] Kabbit_99: Thank you vrexiaH
[5:09:32] freeranger619: Dan try to get another pet
[5:09:33] DrummerBen006: just out source it to a competent division of people
[5:09:37] misterhxc: Can you currently get into wow without ever playing it previously, or will it feel like you are way behind?
[5:09:48] Vesper_Knight: Reforged was an ?-grade
[5:09:48] AlisaeRae: @misterhxc Yes and no
[5:09:49] jediknight223: I liked the models but it was the cutscenes that should of gotten more love.
[5:09:50] zoeathena_sg: Don’t think deathwing was in Warcraft 3…can’t remember lolol think only WC 2
[5:09:58] Xyst_x: WC3 was my childhood i loved playing Winter Maul Wars and other mini games

[5:10:29] konejeesus: never play retail :)
[5:10:41] Appz: if you wanna crap down your leg, play HC
[5:10:41] jediknight223: @zoeathena_sg Correct. Only Warcraft II. You fought Black Dragons in a side bit of one Human Map so that was it.
[5:10:43] Grouch08: danWokege
[5:10:46] Sehria_K: the last time I played WoW was Legion
[5:10:50] altie1: Retail is full of qol stuff but it lacks a bit of charm and nostalgia
[5:10:52] jediknight223: @jediknight223 in Warcraft III.
[5:10:54] Mavmike82: or wait for SoD on the 30th :)

[5:12:09] nolraizer24: @chromaticcorps3 danLove
[5:12:14] Skipitin: In the last year I gave a try for FF14. Very easy and ended up reading a lot of stuff out loud to practice my english speaking while going through story.
[5:12:16] craaazytrain: I swap characters every retail WoW patch because of how OP catchup gear is
[5:12:18] Point1985: It's more tailored to the instant gratification culture we live in?
[5:12:20] nolraizer24: @nnavy15 danLove
[5:12:21] FrodoFraggins: ols Blizzard was fine with people taking breaks and unsubbing.  modern blizzards needs to keep you addicted
[5:12:28] Toon11: pvp was end game
[5:12:29] Lionkingler1: barely anyone clears mythic raids when looking at the whole population of the game
[5:12:31] LooneyHouse: The journey was the game to me.
[5:12:33] Dox023: @tsithik I mean it’s really not that bad if you consider that the same sub fee also gets you access to all the classic servers etc. too.
[5:12:37] Random_Flask: about the journey back then

[5:13:40] craaazytrain: Being able to vtube solves alot of social issues
[5:13:42] Kefka_did_nothing_wrong: because having to go through 20 years of content at the pace of vanilla would kill anyone's interest
[5:13:45] ElusiveOne_: Tifa is a Vtuber actually. Dan is her avatar danNodders

[5:14:51] BoodyTV: ssf is a tick box

[5:14:55] epSeaLion: its still going to be HC?
[5:14:57] 47smokes: what about ssf++++?
[5:15:00] Skipitin: Is it like Ironman?
[5:15:01] Ithiras: @DansGaming did you see that in the next retail expansion your account gets an account wide bank for all your characters.  You can even craft from it too.
[5:15:03] Grid1010: you can't trade? so you'd have to level enchanting every time you get new gear? monkaW
[5:15:04] CHUPAWUNGA: yep

[5:15:17] TheSteventh: why not play wotlk then?
[5:15:18] BoodyTV: @DansGaming SSF is just an addition to HC not forcing it on everyone.
[5:15:19] authorized411: less fedex quests

[5:15:22] PBRbiter: SSFHCBTW
[5:15:28] LooneyHouse: I am enjoying Classic Wrath
[5:15:30] jediknight223: Classic through Wrath was the most fun for me as a WoW player.
[5:15:30] Kefka_did_nothing_wrong: most of the specs actually KEKW
[5:15:32] MonthOLDpickle: OG WoW you're basically pigeon holed into a spec
[5:15:37] Lionkingler1: PepeLaugh ret, boomkin, dps shaman
[5:15:37] MonthOLDpickle: were*
[5:15:37] Tsithik: @Dox023 hmm so if not for wow classic the sub wouldnt be worth it it sounds like
[5:15:38] pedrokm: TBC was the xpac i played more, so is there that nostalgia kicks in
[5:15:44] VeckzanTV: Vanilla is good if you want   Raiding and Hardcore is better for the rest imo
[5:15:45] CHUPAWUNGA: yep 󠀀
[5:15:51] jediknight223: Agreed.
[5:15:51] glb13: @jediknight223 totally agree danYes
[5:15:58] parasocial_enjoyer: tbc and wrath didn't age as well as classic imo
[5:15:59] SekretAznMan: 💯 NODDERS
[5:16:02] Skipitin: What is the worst WoW expansion?
[5:16:04] Filiam__: so when Cataclysm Classic releases, will all that good WotLK stuff go away? classic servers still confuse me
[5:16:13] authorized411: in wrath they figured out how to  do quests that move you through a zone
[5:16:14] PToastman: Warlords
[5:16:16] WoloThePirate: @Skipitin warlords
[5:16:17] Grid1010: wrath post ulduar was when the game began going downhill imho
[5:16:17] Kefka_did_nothing_wrong: wrath was at the state when classes were finally fit for a game launch LUL
[5:16:23] HurricaneHenry: I preferred Vanilla because it had the most magical feeling a new great game. TBC was also incredible though. Wrath not as much
[5:16:26] CatDad__: I was wondering, which Staff is that?
[5:16:29] GaztinErag: yeah I found mithril before I found iron lol
[5:16:32] jediknight223: I would pay for a cheaper Classic WoW only sub.
[5:16:49] BoodyTV: @Filiam__ yes, only classic vanilla will be permanent. Every other classic gets rolled into next expansion
[5:16:50] altie1: Time to go to plaguelands.
[5:16:51] Lionkingler1: impossible to get good raid loot
[5:17:11] PoptartDinosaur: You don't want spirit / strength gear? LUL
[5:17:11] Vesper_Knight: I really don’t like how they ended up handling Arthas
[5:17:26] Grid1010: to be fair, spirit is great early game
[5:17:28] violacious1: I stopped playing wrath once they started giving away tier gear tokens for raids. Started making the gear grind less rewarding
[5:17:38] Filiam__: @BoodyTV I see, thanks!
[5:17:47] auralfX: tried to make a melee attack power priest at one point that would whack you with a staff
[5:17:47] Tsithik: how many wow expanttions will they go up to on classic? like when does it no longer classify as classic
[5:18:03] jediknight223: I LOVED Wrath because I got to interact with Arthas so much. His story in Warcraft III is why I joined WoW.
[5:18:06] Skipitin: Hmm. redlettermedia has done best of the worst with movies. Same with the great in vanilla wow?
[5:18:06] Kei_L: 4 str 4 stam leather belt? Hyperwow
[5:18:07] EXCOM: I think having bad gear is a good thing. Everything shouldnt be great or valid. Classic....
[5:18:13] nolraizer24: danLurk
[5:18:17] TheZyfor: Int/Agi is nice for low level solo priest but there isnbad stuff too
[5:18:19] Corvin_Tom: what was so good about wrath?
[5:18:27] freeranger619: Dan what the best pet to get in game
[5:18:37] Lionkingler1: @Tsithik probably up to WoD
[5:18:39] Micnl7: Huner need mana @DansGaming that why spirit LuL
[5:18:41] Manyfist: Melee mage Kappa
[5:18:41] jiub92: for me itemisation is best in tbc, wotlk is already too standardised.
[5:18:43] SekretAznMan: NODDERS
[5:18:44] jediknight223: Cataclysm Classic shouldn't exist because to me, it's no longer Classic.
[5:18:46] CHUPAWUNGA: NODDERS

[5:19:06] Yusiri: the music
[5:19:07] pedrokm: @Corvin_Tom nostalgia and arthas closure. OFC everything was well round up as dan said
[5:19:10] Sehria_K: oh god that one dungeon where the lich king chases you horrified me the first time I saw it
[5:19:11] Biggestcombo: to be fair limited attempts ICC was a bit dumb, but overall Ulduar was amazing

[5:19:39] Mescheen: Tuskarr
[5:19:40] oldbeardedwhiteguy: nod, grizzly hills music very good

[5:40:18] wiggle_everytime_boop: @TheSteventh is the pre- old school rune scape version of ultima still popular?
