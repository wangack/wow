[0:51:15] Mads2290: @groknarian ***
[0:51:22] Funkix17: oh new ffeature
[0:51:35] Linxwins: Is anyone else able to get on US classic servers?
[0:51:44] Mads2290: its in the patch notes with the ulduar news
[0:52:10] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[0:52:21] gallywyx4721: no its kind of like mythic keystones accept instead of obtaining keystones you interact with a titan runestone what that does is increase the difficulty of all mobs all loot in all dungeons with the titan runestone mode is bumped up to nax 10m gear
[0:52:32] gallywyx4721: also to answer your question im not sure about the prereq
[0:52:57] gallywyx4721: my default
[0:52:58] Mads2290: nope
[0:53:00] Mads2290: 10m only
[0:53:02] gallywyx4721: i think so
[0:53:02] MartinPocrezze: hello dude nice to see you still alive and kicking
[0:53:06] Cowardpatty: No, you increase from heroic dungeon, to Naxx 10
[0:53:10] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[0:53:11] gallywyx4721: oh 10mk only?
[0:53:19] Mads2290: only heroic and then heroic + no higher
[0:53:34] gallywyx4721: ah ok makes much more sense im thankfull they arnt going crazy like they did with keystones
[0:53:42] Cowardpatty: "Gear that formerly dropped in Normal 10-player versions of Naxxramas, Eye of Eternity, and The Obsidian Sanctum can now drop from dungeon bosses when they’re under the effects of the Mysterious Titanic Relic."
[0:53:46] gallywyx4721: it only goes up to 10 man nax gear only
[0:54:08] gallywyx4721: im guessing as the xpac progresses the gear will increase with each phase
[0:54:17] Mads2290: i think its only like a catch up feature that allows players coming for ulduar to get gear quickly probably...
[0:54:35] Cowardpatty: John, here is non-vague explanation - "Gear that formerly dropped in Normal 10-player versions of Naxxramas, Eye of Eternity, and The Obsidian Sanctum can now drop from dungeon bosses when they’re under the effects of the Mysterious Titanic Relic."
[0:55:03] gallywyx4721: i mean it would be awesome if they actually did something with it like mythic keystones but not as crazy

[1:37:50] romes4: those new dung* _
[1:37:55] kilgharrah88: No... this is new
[1:37:56] Absolute_96: No
[1:38:01] TheRenderMan: No. This is completely new
[1:38:02] kilgharrah88: Titan Rune is new
[1:38:04] Absolute_96: There was no heroic+ back in the day
[1:38:10] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[1:38:15] Cowardpatty: This is new, and it was easier back in the day.  Heroic Wrath dungeons are famous for being easy
[1:38:16] gallywyx4721: the feature is new but thats how hard  heroics were back then
[1:38:39] kaoticbacon: nax is too easy
[1:38:48] wootissimo2013: afternoon, swifty
[1:38:57] Absolute_96: If it's a catch up system it shouldn't be hard at all
[1:39:00] beerus420: thats normal hc no?
[1:39:01] TheRenderMan: At least it's hard instead of a cake walk. Make the content relevant.
[1:39:25] Absolute_96: @TheRenderMan yeah but it's meant to be a catch up
[1:39:34] SilkeySmooth: people lready leave in heroic plus?...lol
[1:39:37] WOOPsWOOP: I like casual content
[1:39:45] Cowardpatty: I too do not like to be challenged!  LOL

[1:40:20] gallywyx4721: Bosses inside Titan Rune Dungeons that have Defense Protocol Alpha active will drop their regular loot tables, as well as additional loot from 10-player Naxxramas. Final bosses in each Titan Rune Dungeon will drop Item Level 213 loot from 10-player Kel'Thuzad, 10-player Malygos, and 10-player Sartharion loot tables.
[1:40:40] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:40:46] Garbaje_Gaming: could also mean you need a high skill to play the heroic plus dungeon
[1:40:49] kaoticbacon: priest keeps pulling aggro
[1:40:59] Absolute_96: in my opinion anything hard in classic wow shouldn't be ideal for blizzard. People play classic because it is easier for them than retail
[1:41:12] swiftyhealer: !redeem forthealliance
[1:41:12] StreamElements: @swiftyhealer, you successfully redeemed forthealliance for 1 points. elementsOkay
[1:41:33] beerus420: where does it show its hc+ ?
[1:41:50] swiftyhealer: are you prot
[1:42:02] gallywyx4721: but you also gotta look at it this way your doing DUNGEONS for raid gear
[1:42:08] actual_dalix: Last boss drop a satchel with 3 conquest badge
[1:42:10] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[1:42:30] yarmoli: it is harder cause you are doin naxx 10 5 ppl
[1:42:40] Garbaje_Gaming: completing the dungeon on this difficulty might just come down to group coordination. not necessarily just having 25 man gear

[1:43:41] Garbaje_Gaming: i will see other groups and make a decision based on that.
[1:43:56] carthede: Not hard to imagine, blizz has overtuned plenty in the past
[1:44:13] SilkeySmooth: so its for the 1%
[1:44:30] NeonXeon: I just feel like they should not have added that into Classic, if they wanted a harder dungeon challenge.. go play Retail for M+
[1:44:33] Jad_Fang_Noxious: i was about to ask how you got calssic UI in retail until i noticed your buff bar and the stream name xD
