[3:04:08] Kemskemss: Scripe, if u were to pick up a healer in retail, which one would it be?
[3:04:16] Eliannoula: yes
[3:04:17] Faeynna: I think you were to fast.. he has a small "spawn" timer
[3:05:51] tvilk: Priest healer is great because you have 2 healer specs that plays completely differently. So if you don't like one you can the other. Reactive vs Preemptive healing and one of them is always considered good
[3:08:02] tvilk: a lot of priests play Holy early in seasons while still learning the dungeons because it's easier to remedy mistakes on Holy, then switch Disc later if it's the better spec
[3:08:30] azzalol: How is Mage in SOD? im thinking of playing it
[3:09:24] tow996: @azzalol strongest
