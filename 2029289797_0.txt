[0:31:34] iNSANEono: connecting happi
[0:31:38] Daladed: friendlynews
[0:32:03] chum1y: i've never seen it foggy like this here before.
[0:32:52] chum1y: like the hottest place on the planet is 60km from me.  it doesnt really do fog here.
[0:33:36] 21up21: @chum1y what country?
[0:33:44] chum1y: NA
[0:34:13] chum1y: i'm in coachella valley, we're next to death valley
[0:34:35] 21up21: @chum1y that's pretty cool. logging in from the desert
[0:35:20] Jonathan_4567: hows it going moo?
[0:35:26] chum1y: its not remote here though.  the ultra rich pretty much transformed this entire area to resorts.  all the snow birds come here during the winter.
[0:35:43] chum1y: like a million pepople here now
[0:36:11] Jonathan_4567: fuck all to do
[0:36:27] Oriforestx: Why are you leveling locks?
[0:36:32] Jonathan_4567: but at least next phase is soon enough
[0:36:38] Jonathan_4567: play some dotes in the downtime
[0:36:44] chum1y: 3 weeks 3 days
[0:37:11] 21up21: @chum1y sounds comfy, dude.  Now you get a nice little fog as well to cool you down.
[0:37:23] chum1y: i'm honestly thinking about jumping on KR server to play throne and liberty because the pvp looks sick af @Jonathan_4567
[0:37:50] FixIT258: How  many lvl35 prof alts u got planned right now?
[0:37:58] 21up21: just level another warrior
[0:38:10] Gwent: omg man
[0:38:58] chum1y: u seen throne and liberty yet mn?  i watched a vid for 500+ man world boss and it was playable af
[0:39:21] chum1y: it looks like Nost pvp
[0:39:46] foxisnotgod: moo is maining lock now
[0:39:56] chum1y: its ncsoft
[0:40:02] chum1y: game been in production for 11 years
[0:40:16] chum1y: amazon is doing the global release
[0:41:00] chum1y: this game u can buy the marketplace gold
[0:41:09] chum1y: but u can sell items on the marketplace for same currency
[0:41:28] chum1y: the rank 1 pvp guy rn is F2P
[0:41:43] chum1y: so it looks like the whale gap isn't ruining the game
[0:42:05] chum1y: and its not like SoD isn't p2w as the game is rn
[0:42:09] 21up21: didn't even say bye to your new friends?
[0:42:44] chum1y: yeah
[0:42:58] chum1y: blade and soul got ruined
[0:43:23] chum1y: after the first expansion they just added a slot machine that gave the best gear in the game
[0:43:27] chum1y: it was dead in less thana  month
[0:44:04] chum1y: but lost ark is still going pretty hard
[0:44:21] chum1y: its doing better than diablo 4 LUL
[0:45:01] suavo_: suavo_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! big five oh
[0:45:01] chum1y: idk.  i'm gonna play the fresh global release for TL.
[0:45:15] satanic_pope: ello guvner @Monkeynews
[0:45:17] gearlessjordy: how do you get the name plates magnified ?
[0:45:19] oblivionBG: You’d probably enjoy the guild and pvp aspects of Throne and Liberty honestly @monkeynews but there are definitely some p2w concerns in it
[0:46:22] chum1y: also the seige event in throne and liberty gives a 22% tax on every purchase made int he game to the winners
[0:46:36] chum1y: like rn on the KR server it has like $20k worth of currency in it
[0:46:41] gearlessjordy: thanks mooo
[0:46:47] graffLoL: do i need warcraftlogs app to upload logs ?
[0:46:54] graffLoL: or its possible without
[0:47:05] chum1y: it kinda looks like whoever has the biggest zerg guild is going to win regardless
[0:47:30] oblivionBG: It’s definitely very guild heavy
[0:47:37] chum1y: seems that way
[0:51:05] chum1y: oh yeah and they're all talking about the hardcore pvp scene, since sword/shield is different mechanically than everything else, it's straight wrecking the meta apart.
[0:51:17] chum1y: like they can just charge thru 100 people and start attacking the back lines
[0:51:43] chum1y: and wipe entire support groups solo
[0:52:08] chum1y: game seems like a warriors dream
[0:52:55] bodkinz_: eww that wand sound
[0:53:19] 21up21: @chum1y i want to be one of the supports getting wrecked by a warrior
[0:53:31] Leemuff: interesting looking warrior
[0:53:33] chum1y: wand main @21up21
[0:53:34] Tripped1: wtf is this
[0:54:25] oblivionBG: @chum1y SnS and Greatsword both feel nice in it and have decent amount of variance to their skill combos
[0:55:22] chum1y: if i went gs i'd prob go dagger
[0:55:55] chum1y: as is prob looking at bow dagger
[0:56:45] chum1y: but it seems they are buffing gs right now so idk ill wait and see what looks better when they announce global
[0:57:28] chum1y: the only thing holding me back from kr server is that the raid times and guild times and pvp times are all super scuffed for me
[0:58:57] yacopok: Warlock monka
[1:00:04] Antelic: yo @Monkeynews did u use itemrack for ur warriors in sod?
[1:00:55] Antelic: hmm weird, like i downloaded itemrack and it just resets my keybinds every time i log inn for some reason so i cant use it

[1:41:09] Snith: Hello sir, about to make another Horde Warrior and wanted to get your opinion of Orc vs Troll (PvE only). I feel like they have to introduce more Axes overall in Vanilla, but to do you still favour Blood Fury vs Berserking? Even at 30%? And the same goes for the haste buff at 60?
[1:41:47] exec92: PepoG
[1:42:08] HerpVonDerping_: KEKW

[1:55:16] delusion4l_: all ur wars are wsg exaulted?
[1:55:24] rogey21: why even level locks to 25
[1:55:46] Fysickzz: Thinking the phase 2 date are fine for everyone except streamers playing the game 24/7
[1:55:50] schmutsig: Ye i agree, im mostly raid logging for now, lost sword for the 3rd time on warrior this week :(
[1:56:38] rogey21: @Fysickzz phase 2 date is way too late. i havent played in 2 weeks, mid january would have been perfect
[1:56:49] rogey21: full time job
[1:57:08] gotbannedforgoldbuying: yea phase 2 late by 2weeks atleast
[1:57:09] nordman8: Chatting
[1:57:18] gotbannedforgoldbuying: should be 3rd week of jan
[1:57:21] gotbannedforgoldbuying: perfect timing
[1:57:41] gaming5150: Has there ever been a patch realese good timed? ppl always complain what ever the realease date is
[1:58:33] 21up21: i reckon we should just stay at lvl 25
[1:59:00] gotbannedforgoldbuying: i guess we are complaing cus we degenerates who play this game all the time so we just starve for new content
[1:59:13] Fysickzz: Mostly people who complain it's too late are people with 15x chars in 25 doing bfd 15x every 3 day :D
[1:59:48] rogey21: KEKW
[1:59:54] Fysickzz: That's true, i mean i have 4 ready chars
[1:59:57] rogey21: 1 character at 25 not ready is unfathomable
[2:00:12] Fysickzz: nerd ?? :(
[2:00:19] exec92: haha nerd

[2:25:26] chum1y: they rework some of the classes and give them new mechanics like hunter and pala completely change
[2:26:07] kozzieu: i can link you v15 of the layer swap WA moo so it doesnt spam "you are not in a guild"
[2:26:10] chum1y: the state of the heroics when it goes live is all that matters
[2:26:18] chum1y: if they are pre nerf it will be a challenge and fun
[2:26:24] chum1y: if its post nerf it will be free.
[2:26:29] Snith: Doesn't the trainer in Ratchet do it?
