[2:16:52] Mmatto_: Hello again Guzu how ya doin mon?
[2:16:53] Rahmulous: @clyrotv they could have way better interactions in actual fun games to watch. there‚Äôs a reason BG3 is so low on streamers even though it‚Äôs incredibly popular. It‚Äôs like watching someone read a book. there‚Äôs very little chat interaction and very little action period.

[2:19:08] Curtsy: @Rahmulous Yeah it's pretty niche game because of how long it is, act 1 can be 90+ hours alone on your first play
[2:19:11] radiera: do you still use an Antivirus ?
[2:19:14] Smooo07: ye what was it? i missed yesterdays stream
[2:19:19] H1manu: Starforge installed norton in his PC but it lagged the fuck out of it
[2:19:20] tbseason: @Rahmulous did you also know you can use twitch intergration to link your amazon prime account to your twitch account, and qualify for twitch prime! Twitch prime enables you to sub FOR FREE once a month to your favorite streamer! Maybe consider Guzu? :)
[2:19:20] Rezoix: Norton Misery
[2:19:22] xelm_: its just bloatware
[2:19:26] sneaky937: just dont download dodgey shtiy
[2:19:27] Curtsy: Just use windows defender yeah
[2:19:27] PocketLotion: shadow of the colossus is goated

[2:19:34] xelm_: ye
[2:19:36] draiopy: you need antivirus if you a company .. for causual person not so much!!
[2:19:38] mlady_telegramz97: @viclund1 while guzu was starting lethal company, his antivirus was lagging him out
[2:19:39] StandardOut: Wait wait wait.... StarForge Systems come with bloatware?!??!?!
[2:19:40] mlady_telegramz97: @viclund1 KEKW

[2:19:51] 0x22__: unless you have less than 2 brain cells
[2:19:54] Curtsy: @StandardOut its a prebuilt company dude of course it does
[2:19:54] mormac99: what is the namepplate addon you have
[2:19:55] Osi7z: I would recommend some extra defence, but ok, to each his/her own
[2:19:56] neruk887: defender is also antivirus.
[2:19:58] sneaky937: VPN inbuilt defenders work well
[2:19:59] br0fest0r: Just use the windows anti-virus, 3rd party anti-virus isn't needed in 2024 for the average user.
[2:20:00] Curtsy: they pay companies to add it
[2:20:03] gia__: the dodgy shit is installing the anti virus
[2:20:04] viclund1: I swear most anti virsus turn out worse than viruses KEKW
[2:20:05] xelm_: !plater
[2:20:05] StreamElements: Plater profile link https://controlc.com/a5f1aa25 It is only an import string, you need to import it into the addon like this https://youtu.be/6Qvf48m-m_0?t=566
[2:20:06] LeBiz: you might wanna consider it, seeing as a lot of the files saved on your computer is your content right

[2:20:10] Shocklate_: Whats the game called?
[2:20:10] xelm_: yw
[2:20:19] StandardOut: @Curtsy Why would it..?
[2:20:19] Mythos_Chamber: If you aren't doing weird stuff why even be on the internet?
[2:20:20] Rezoix: As long as you keep your software up to date and aren't complete idiot windows defender is fine
[2:20:25] LostOrbitt: hi
[2:20:29] radiera: Any experience using Bitdefender ?
[2:20:30] H1manu: FirstTimeChatter
[2:20:30] Shocklate_: This one :)
[2:20:30] Smooo07: @Shocklate_ this game? world of warcraft

[2:20:45] H1manu: om npc griefing themsellf
[2:20:47] Rahmulous: @clyrotv even with chat integration almost nobody streams it. It‚Äôs just not a good stream game. That‚Äôs clear from the numbers. highest grossing game in 2023, GOTY, and it only has a couple thousand total viewers on twitch.
[2:20:47] Smooo07: never seen it
[2:20:50] xelm_: sometimes yea
[2:20:52] H1manu: Yes
[2:20:55] draiopy: some people get up until 50% of the money so if someone buys norton for 100‚Ç¨ they influencer can get like 50‚Ç¨ for it that why norton and mcvirus are so pre installed in shit
[2:21:01] Ticklezao: vpns are not scam lol wtf, people just dont know what they are for
[2:21:04] Curtsy: @StandardOut they dont add bloatware out of malicious intent, its for profit
[2:21:05] xelm_: shes just a lonely apple seller
[2:21:06] StreeTriple: @radiera its fine, just make sure you get it on discount if your going to purchase it
[2:21:25] parsnip: Any glizzys today?
[2:21:25] Smooo07: i remember on a hc char she wasnt around when i yoinked the apples, but didnt think anything of it
[2:21:27] StandardOut: @Curtsy Oh they make money for installing viruses. Cool
[2:21:27] tackerta: @Ticklezao the way VPNs advertise themselves, they are scams
[2:21:34] H1manu: @Curtsy I found one which didn't install any bloatware, but they also excluded the Driver for graphics card... om

[2:44:37] PMA_1: hopefully they delay the raid for the following week so people dont feel like they need to RUSH @Guzu
[2:44:40] pickoneforme: @Guzu I'm 100% convinved Blizz will delay the Gnomeregan by 1 week on P2 release. That's why they asked about it on Twitter. So people can level with no rush.
[2:44:46] twitchforgotmyaccount: Aggrend hinted on twitter that you probably want to do BFD while leveling.
[2:44:51] Poxstep94: @tackerta damn hardcore is to much for me haha
[2:44:55] hushbang: Your Exalted with Savix and Neutral with Mordiell
[2:44:59] Smooo07: kinda chill, but slowly getting boring
[2:45:01] TobimaroTV: i have 4 lvl 25s, cant stop alting
[2:45:04] bubbathetumps: People cannot play this game without Min/Max mentality
[2:45:08] Poxstep94: couldnt handle losing an lvl 60 char haha
[2:45:14] Bidsee: If bfd is a level per lockout id do it
[2:45:15] ryan___mcg: yeah i‚Äôm a casual player with 1 toon and i have perfect amount of time to pvp and raid and try to get bis before p2

[2:45:34] zartuus: and raid will not be available before 1 week after the start of the phase
[2:45:35] evildufus: @ryan___mcg same
[2:45:37] Ewriick: foreshadowing guzuGiggle
[2:45:43] SippinSimpSyrup: It‚Äôs so fucking stupid to delay

[2:45:50] ralphmouse85: The ashenvale event has actually turned into  pvp the past few days
[2:45:56] ChopSuey133: super min maxers will level 3 chars to 40 and run gnomer 3 times in the first lockout

[2:46:08] Desolacer: xqcL sorry for my juicer
[2:46:09] Pixiepantss: ??

[2:46:21] TobimaroTV: 15 levels and prebis on 4 characters, plenty to do
[2:46:23] sircrumpler: 25-40 will take a min
[2:46:24] mopchild: theres plenty to do in the first week, level proffesions, pre bis
[2:46:25] Tiamattinen: If you can't find something to do in SoD, why not try retail for a swing?
[2:46:25] Smooo07: ye exactly
[2:46:27] mlady_telegramz97: its 15 levels to do
[2:46:27] teagobby: "nothing to do" andys scared of having a singular thought flow through their head
[2:46:28] Curtsy: If there's nothing to do that's a clue that you spend too much time in your chair, go outside
[2:46:29] Seoken1: AB Rep/STV Rep
[2:46:29] SpaceCowboy0811: delay it for 2 weeks, fuck it
[2:46:30] ashtaroxx: there is roleplay you can do plunk
[2:46:33] GozzyW: There will also be new stuff to ... discover
[2:46:33] Smooo07: i dont think i will be 40 in 1 week
[2:46:40] Bewis_: dude can go touch some grass, thats something to do
[2:46:41] H1manu: look at clip you saved in Browser...
[2:46:43] mlady_telegramz97: the XP you need from 1-40 is also only halfway
[2:46:44] H1manu: @Guzu

[2:46:47] neruk887: not everyone plays 24/7 wow
[2:46:48] sl1nky1981: Delay it to phase 3
[2:46:57] evildufus: I hope for the delay, let people explore the runes, pvp, find the new secrets. People are just lame and jump online to read everything instead of experiencing it
[2:46:57] Rahmulous: !vanish
[2:46:58] ralphmouse85: New runes
[2:46:59] Poxstep94: @tackerta fairs :D also im pvp player that only does PvE content for the gear

[2:47:09] geennaamnl1: what are you talking about  Iwill be lvl 40 in 1day and be bored out of the wazooo cause no one else is lvl 40
[2:47:09] Smooo07: also depends on shifts ofc, could be stuck with a 12 hour shift so i will take my sweet time anyways
[2:47:12] hushbang: Whats the rush anyways - this is NOT new content
[2:47:12] HeadShot794: Play something else till then Yepge  @SippinSimpSyrup
[2:47:13] LuminescentLlama: guguJAM

[2:47:26] Bidsee: Yeah if its not ready, delay it. but if they are delaying it to prevent people from feeling like they are falllingg behind wouuld be whack
[2:47:26] LuminescentLlama: guguJAM sod hype
[2:47:29] ShruniWasTaken: And STV is gonna be a whole new beast compared to what we are used to in era
[2:47:29] sircrumpler: You think we'll get a DemonicRune ?

[2:48:20] DamDamPew: I still have only done BFD twice
[2:48:20] mlady_telegramz97: @guzu SOD released on 30 November i think
[2:48:21] EpicShot: ye bootybay

[2:48:33] s0ftboiled: @Smooo07 truth

[2:48:45] EpicShot: pvp will be crazy though
[2:48:45] macjcool: do you think they will add a teleport to SM for the alliance? like they did for bfd
[2:48:46] Smooo07: ye
[2:48:47] falapala: it's going to be camped so hard
[2:48:50] ClyroTV: TP should just take you straight in. On a PvP server the TP is gonna be horrible

[2:49:26] ramjack13: om
[2:49:27] Rahmulous: Booty Bay doesn‚Äôt allow mounts so getting to Gnomer raid from IF will absolutely be faster at level 40
[2:49:32] evildufus: The camping at bfd is awful, more of the same lol
[2:49:33] saren_x: @Grocery7 who knows Shruge

[2:57:53] LeBiz: or is it wotlk
[2:57:53] TrueNosus: what if you gave rogues "auto throw" similar to auto shot but for thrown weapons, rogue range spec @Guzu
[2:57:54] Seoken1: canonball knockdown aoe would be super cool for rogue
[2:57:55] skeemsquash: so ur saying you‚Äôre not a fan of knives?

[2:58:20] sickish: envenom proc poison bomb is fun. they should add that
[2:58:20] Yaabbuu: i have that about wotlk ret divine storm feels not as good as whirlwind even tho its basically the same
[2:58:22] Tempist_tv: combo point swapper rune pls
[2:58:23] saren_x: some kind of bomb talents would fit the class NODDERS
[2:58:24] LuminescentLlama: well rogues are shallow beings
