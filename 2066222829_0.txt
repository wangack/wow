[0:30:02] saltyseadoggg: Why would they cancel you?
[0:30:28] greenvuvuzela: did you see tinyviolin's HC wipe on cthun today?
[0:30:44] 2drunk4this: they are popular... we know it was the machines
[0:30:47] coolcrazyguy72: youll only get cancelled if your not calm
[0:30:47] Genghish: "unpopular"
[0:31:00] SgtBrownBeard: an entire certain community pepeLaugh
[0:31:05] Zantetsu13: thats why you should be pushing the political angle to normalize your views
[0:31:05] mohihe3834: is there anyone else whose made that transition
[0:31:08] weloveufreddie: What do you think the lvl P3 raid will be?
[0:31:11] NooleanB: I disagree with you on a fair amount of stuff, but still enjoy watching
[0:31:13] Genghish: I think alot of us are just not allowed to talk
[0:31:20] DemigodzLegacy: ahahah
[0:31:21] weloveufreddie: The p3 raid*
[0:31:34] DougMaisner: musk even said he self censors
[0:31:43] sammixi: we need a staysafe uncensored political podcast on pornhub
[0:31:56] craboskai: wasn't it SM during the blizzcon sneak peek
[0:32:01] GunTheRedneck: its the blue trinket

[0:32:35] Arathionn: I'm hoping for sunken Temple
[0:32:40] sammixi: ST would be sick
[0:32:41] DougMaisner: mara is my all time fav run
[0:32:44] Wintyreknight: i think its ZF since you cant access the raid
[0:32:46] magnusrockhide: so Kara crypts at 50?
[0:32:50] sigilfish: SM Prayge
[0:32:52] lickmypetals: Why only 1 raid? why cant they add multiple raids?
[0:33:00] baldnfattv: both at 60
[0:33:03] Mertauh: wpl is technically ~50 so it kinda makes sense for it to be a hearthglenn scarlet raid
[0:33:05] baldnfattv: 50 sm
[0:33:10] Aeycka__: ST would be way cooler B) I've seen enough of Kara for one lifetime xD
[0:33:26] ctrlbeesy: best lock spec for pvp?
[0:33:35] letsgoforsen123: Subtlety
[0:33:35] Mawshaw: Please make level 50 raid a 20 man Prayge
[0:33:35] lickmypetals: kara was already intended to be apart of classic wow , TBC was never supposed to exist
[0:33:41] NaManDatAintMe: ST is a great dungeon already
[0:33:53] NaManDatAintMe: id rather have zf and st for next phase theyre fun
[0:33:54] 2drunk4this: st the longest piece of chit
[0:34:23] Blockaaattv: If you played retail you have done the Kara "rework"
[0:34:32] Blockaaattv: im really hoping they dont copy posta that
[0:34:33] kurkis493: I'm assuming they take the reworked SM and turn that into the raid
[0:34:42] baldnfattv: yeah
[0:34:43] orrangejuiced: Hearthglen raid
[0:34:43] smee3x: there was a kara raid and dungeon in retail
[0:34:45] AntarcticTreaty: I wonder if their Kara Crypts will be as bad as Turtle Wows globikLUL

[0:36:31] justlootzhs: I always thought it would be sick if they made a raid in the far east of wetlands where all the elite red dragons are
[0:36:34] DangerfieldSOSA: it would be cool if the 50 raid was ST. that dungeon hasnt gotten enough love.
[0:36:40] orrangejuiced: Since they datamined refreshed Tier1 sets with dps stats, I'm hoping for a feral version of Sulfuras
[0:36:57] QuestFor420: ye
[0:36:58] Randomguy_360: i kind of hope it's not ST just because I hate the aesthetic of that place but if it is that's cool too

[1:18:20] xspeedietv: yea along that road is 2 of them sucks beach is bad,
[1:18:22] Randomguy_360: warlock is in a fine spot rn for pvp
[1:18:22] davoskaaaa: Shadow priest is like a better Warlock KEKW
[1:18:35] wolfxrg: is boss same spot every layer?
[1:18:45] davoskaaaa: How is Warlock in a fine spot compared to a shadow priest?
[1:18:48] souvil: @davoskaaaa not even pve, compared to other classes we ar lacking right now
[1:18:55] Lunights: had a group today that just refused to get within the buff range. bunch of tards
[1:19:18] Randomguy_360: @souvil warlocks are 2nd highest DPS in pve right now and are mid tier / strong in pvp
[1:19:29] davoskaaaa: Warlock fking sucks right now, its just "decent", you have to hard cast everything to be able to do big damage or spam searing pain in meta form
[1:20:17] davoskaaaa: you want to affli lock? no damage  Meanwhile: Shadow priest shadow word death: 2000 dmg one shot + are able to fear you and dot you without removing the fear + stack dots
[1:20:25] andypandynz: @davoskaaaa never heard of class being decent as a negative LUL
[1:20:28] Randomguy_360: affli lock has plenty of damage idk what you are talking about
[1:20:32] Randomguy_360: it's just not burst
[1:20:38] Randomguy_360: in pvp
[1:20:43] StoneyYeti: whats ur build rn
[1:21:02] Randomguy_360: you trade being able to nuke 1 guy down for being able to dot up an entire team and pressure their healers
[1:21:10] hehelolololol: is there a way to tell where the boss is
[1:21:16] Randomguy_360: and destruction lock can instant kill any class
[1:21:19] rich5lut: <3
[1:21:30] davoskaaaa: Its not instant, its a hard cast
[1:21:40] souvil: @Randomguy_360 but im talking from our runes and abilities, meta is fun but is lacking a lot of stuff
[1:21:44] davoskaaaa: anyone who's decent in pvp will cancel your cast and you'll do fuckall
[1:21:48] Randomguy_360: lmao
[1:21:55] Randomguy_360: use succubus, use fear, use grenades
[1:21:56] M000gul: instant searing pain crits feel nice
[1:22:10] davoskaaaa: you think anyone in arathi's gonna let you INCINERATE+IMMOLATE+CHAOS BOLT?

[1:22:41] andypandynz: @davoskaaaa sounds like user problem
[1:22:52] madgarlicjr: i wouldn't go mage for pvp
[1:22:56] rich5lut: thats not what Snutz would say
[1:23:07] davoskaaaa: Its not a user problem, its a class comparison
[1:23:08] Randomguy_360: you can maybe complain if you play alliance lock, but horde warlock has an easy ass time nuking people
[1:23:14] rich5lut: LUL
[1:23:41] massiveminnow: Maybe you are snutz in disguise?
[1:24:20] Humansoup: WestSIDE \w/
[1:24:21] davoskaaaa: lets assume we're talking warlock, you can take the exact same class which is Shadow priest and compare the playstyle + dmg
[1:24:27] Grommox95: is there a reason to keep doing STV if you have all the items you need and dont want the mount?
[1:24:30] Randomguy_360: cool man go reroll shadow priest then
[1:24:30] 7dogtreats: OMEGALUL
[1:24:35] rich5lut: these hillies need a mark

[1:25:50] thefridge500: USA
[1:25:52] davoskaaaa: Shadow priest: all cast are instant, stack dots that deals way more damage than lock dots and has a rune "shadow word:death" that is instant and deal up to 2000 dmg, can also barrier yourself and heal yourself  Warlock: Put dots and hard cast its way to deal damage OR go Meta and spam searing pain, takes around 7 hard casting seconds to put a full 2000+ burst
[1:26:00] massiveminnow: God bIess USA
[1:26:05] davoskaaaa: Now tell me this is legit and that you should go Warlock > Priest

[1:26:32] davoskaaaa: @Randomguy_360 They sure hurt but you have to be real close to them to get hit so its dodgeable
[1:26:39] Randomguy_360: all shadow priest casts arent instant
[1:26:41] Randomguy_360: do you play the game
[1:26:43] 7dogtreats: or you could just play what you like
[1:26:48] mitchflurry: anyone else see the wowgrandma OF leaks?
[1:26:51] davoskaaaa: The dots + the rune = instant
[1:26:53] rich5lut: @esfand wtf bro
[1:26:59] madgarlicjr: that lil stinker
[1:27:00] davoskaaaa: ive been farming arathi for 2 full days
[1:27:08] Randomguy_360: warlock has more instnat casts than priests by that logic
[1:27:23] Randomguy_360: play better idk what to tell you
[1:27:36] Randomguy_360: warlock is only gonna get stronger after death coil

[1:27:42] davoskaaaa: so i'll just go back to stv ngl
[1:27:47] Rhobarr: Does quest rep cap at revered or it goes all way to exalted?
[1:28:23] davoskaaaa: @Randomguy_360 This is such a weak argument "play better" cause yeah, you think playing better is the whole problem here
[1:28:26] ashmodean1234: does the ashenvale event give darnasssus rep?
[1:28:44] davoskaaaa: I wonder 70% of reddit is people complaining about shadow priest burst KEKW

[1:31:35] Mordean: horde is just animalistic
[1:31:36] infom0rph: im playing alliance in sod and i have to say their flight points suck ass compared to horde
[1:31:46] jazzyjoff: What culture suits the Horde?
[1:31:48] AntarcticTreaty: the Undead are very Eastern European Kappa
[1:31:50] Randomguy_360: horde have always had easier leveling zones and better flight paths
[1:31:54] Randomguy_360: but they still cry about alliance having it
[1:31:54] ItHatWhat: This is our mud hut
[1:31:56] Sohsuh: Horde is much more somali pirate style
[1:31:56] Randomguy_360: for some reason
[1:31:58] tehworks: horde = na = zug zug

[1:32:28] dyarthas: when I say QoL I mean like questing zones are better
[1:32:30] davoskaaaa: @Randomguy_360 "Mind Spike damage increased by 10%. Void Plague damage increased by 10%. Shadow Word: Death base damage before modifiers decreased by 40% and spellpower coefficient adusted to 42.9% (was 64.3%)."

[2:43:02] amgains: wtf
[2:43:02] poorboy55: there is lots in open world
[2:43:02] wookieenthal: I just got a white bandit box
[2:43:03] jarl_b: i feel like the Ghosts in SM GY is super good for boxes
[2:43:03] HexxanTV: i got  ike 7 first day now only 3 over the week
[2:43:03] Marcqel: Questing i got easily 15

[2:43:46] pkeks13: good change
[2:43:53] NutterCircus: filling them is ridiculous
[2:44:03] Echo5Brav0: I dont think you can turn in unfilled boxes in phase 2?
[2:44:06] Raivan994: that would be fun , so not allowed
[2:44:07] nerunehru: might just be anecdotal bias, but i feel like i've gotten none from the good farming spots (like wildvine, heart of the wild, etc.), but I've gotten a ton from doing normal questing on my alt in zones like shimmering flats
[2:44:20] eraser9: yes
[2:44:21] pkeks13: insane
[2:44:31] w3zb0: Winter squid good investment

[2:45:29] N_Tys: do you think lvl 50 bracket will be any different?
[2:45:31] Sohsuh: Just add the 50% XP buff until level 35
[2:45:31] hussletrees: TRUE!
[2:45:32] eraser9: i honestly hoped for 2 raids in P2
[2:45:35] HeIlraiser_: NODDERS
[2:45:36] saberful: 34-38 easy sm runs
[2:45:37] seymourmoney: Is there any reason to have the shifting scale talisman once I have my epic crafting boots?
[2:45:42] Arcsilin: whats even the point rep dosnt give anything
[2:45:45] gucciizzz: is there a warlock weakaura that shows ur runes? if so whats the name?  :)
[2:45:47] onkeliltis: hm LUL
[2:45:47] hussletrees: fckn govt took 40% of my box money
[2:45:49] NutterCircus: Every box I have got is about 15-25g to fill.
[2:45:50] 99deece: Wow thank god there's no GDKP's, the economy is so much better!
[2:45:53] N_Tys: things to do
[2:45:56] zol_zolli: it‚Äôs too expensive - I vendor mine :/
[2:46:00] Scaleless1776: I throw boxes away
[2:46:10] daqqs: i vendor them
[2:46:11] watchmeclickspells: Does boosting with a full 5 man group give more or less exp?
[2:46:35] hussletrees: :)
[2:46:41] eraser9: i like the fishing/cooking reward thought
[2:46:41] amgains: stv items are to ez to obtain
[2:46:45] onkeliltis: ;P
[2:46:49] jazzyjoff: They should have added RP rewards like they did in Gnomeregan
[2:46:51] wookieenthal: ;)
[2:47:01] abruptdecayO_O: i wish theyd add reasons to run dungeons more
[2:47:14] abruptdecayO_O: like mats or idk item currency
[2:47:14] Raivan994: it's honestly better if less people do it
[2:47:15] abruptdecayO_O: somethin
[2:47:15] rullehjem: The rewards for my class are all junk KEKW best is basically a trinket that's a grenade on a 5 minute cd
[2:47:16] isleswitch: next phase u get ST maradounand big dungies
[2:47:17] w3zb0: I'm glad the lag is fixed
[2:47:21] samricho: @StaysafeTV ive just woke up EU and seen that tiny has striked again on HC ??????
[2:47:25] Aeycka__: hot take: make "Discoverer's Delight" be +33% and be always active, because imho Vanilla is a bit dry on quests at lvl 30-60 -> having people be able to skip a couple of the crappiest quests might persuade people to get out of the dungeons and switch to questing
[2:47:27] hussletrees: it should be focused on the PvP-ness
[2:47:32] N_Tys: getting both bis items (mage) in one go at the event is wild
[2:47:34] earlyseasoneric: could add some potions and stuff to it
[2:47:36] Lukeker: you need a ton for arathi rep
[2:47:39] thcbh: NO CHANGES PogChamp
[2:47:39] Peoplewhinetoomuch: The lag isnt fixed though and the layers keep mixing up
[2:47:48] Roziac: do the rep work now?
[2:47:55] ScarfaceCEO: Your Twitter SOD post was solid.
[2:48:06] HexxanTV: can alliance use the raptor?
[2:48:06] jazzyjoff: Word
[2:48:10] Humansoup: True
[2:48:20] onkeliltis: seqThink
[2:48:21] Raivan994: @HexxanTV y
[2:48:23] jallaballan: they need to reduce layers and let players get together and create their own content, like old tarren mill battles
[2:48:27] thcbh: I think making it 200% would be cool
[2:48:32] lordextraordinary: instead they will lower the cost for mount..
[2:48:41] HeIlraiser_: üé£ YEP
[2:48:41] zol_zolli: carrot on a stick trinket
[2:48:43] hussletrees: its like rubix cubes
[2:48:55] ScarfaceCEO: Can we make it 6% so its not an odd number? LUL
[2:48:56] HexxanTV: im autism cause id get it
[2:49:01] Gealls: Most ppl don't get as much coins and only do 1-2 event for day
[2:49:07] tex_oce: 1% is even better right?
[2:49:10] qom99: seems like making things harder/longer just punishes the casuals anyway
[2:49:17] SgtBrownBeard: seasonal server seems like a moot arguement cuz then why play it at all
[2:49:17] Metaphix: what if they made the reward for retail and wrath too
[2:49:24] crunkbub: ill take my free warlock mount
[2:49:28] seksmuhchine: i don't care
[2:49:30] hussletrees: might have ear infection. those can be nasty
[2:49:31] Roziac: @StaysafeTV so u lumber quest works now?
[2:49:35] mattbarz989: you know what itchy ears mean right?
[2:49:49] HeIlraiser_: lol
[2:49:59] zol_zolli: Ungoro crater is going to be a pain in P3
[2:50:07] Peoplewhinetoomuch: They said they have some plans for gathering professions in P3. Wonder what
[2:50:09] isleswitch: imagine if phase 3 Blizz introduces SOTA BG NotLikeThis
[2:50:22] souljazz: I'm really sad they didn't make gnomer harder and just made it 20 man
[2:50:37] hussletrees: gotta let the noobs have fun too
[2:50:44] mattbarz989: we could go run icc and watch porn while smoking weed
[2:50:50] QuestFor420: yep
[2:51:03] peepoAdmin: nah
[2:51:06] Aeycka__: previous hot-take refined: have Discoverer's Delight only apply to outworld xD I mean that would fit the buff name better too
[2:51:07] Metaphix: its like sitting in a van instead of a bus
[2:51:08] onkeliltis: agreed
[2:51:10] crunkbub: fastest time on gnomer is 30:40 already lol
[2:51:10] HeIlraiser_: LULW Nike
[2:51:15] hussletrees: yeah
[2:51:17] todddiff: FeelsOkayMan Good morning
[2:51:35] VinoHuncho: you ever fish to make gold?
[2:51:39] Mattysaiyan: We're gonna struggle to transition into 40 man raids
[2:51:41] p1ss_minion_suit: u think 40man raids will bring that back at 60?
[2:51:42] w3zb0: I can barely get my 9 other friends fully engaged
[2:51:44] todddiff: <3 OSRS
[2:51:49] flowqz: you are so correct. it really is a problem. our guild is kinda falling appart. will be so cancer when aggrend forces in his 40player raid on max
[2:51:52] ashmodean1234: guilds were a good idea back when everyone was younger and haad much more time to play
[2:51:56] climbingviking: fishing p1 was insane gold
[2:51:58] mattbarz989: how you get loot in a 40 man raid?
[2:52:01] fouriousjorge: 15
[2:52:07] hussletrees: gnomer 20 would be nuts
[2:52:08] mohihe3834: the social experience of major war campaigns
[2:52:08] BolbiDiff: then the rest of us cant pug them every 3 dayts
[2:52:09] SgtBrownBeard: @mattbarz989 do the raid for a year
[2:52:11] ashmodean1234: the game needs to be playable for pugs
[2:52:18] todddiff: @hussletrees 15
[2:52:21] Smoothiez_: i feel like they are going to make all the 40 man raids 20 man
[2:52:24] isleswitch: lets hope ST and BRD are 20 mans
[2:52:25] damepitaa: you know how many people will drop if they makes raids 40 man ? most of the population
[2:52:27] wuanluciano4: gnomer should be 20
[2:52:27] tex_oce: agree but myabe level 50 raids will be 20
[2:52:43] armin_ed: Yeah the 10 man raids make me feel like I dont have to do them at all, if it were 20 man raid I would be like K I NEEED TO DO THIS, cause 19 others are doing it.
[2:52:55] Scaleless1776: fair and balanced coverage
[2:53:06] fouriousjorge: Provided we are doing 25 and 40 man raids.   Just 15 and 30 man
[2:53:17] seksmuhchine: yeah it's cancer
[2:53:19] isleswitch: TBC was also heavy class based
[2:53:27] fouriousjorge: 5 - 15 - 30
[2:53:29] hussletrees: 3, 7, 11, 17. Prime numbers only
[2:53:32] Aeycka__: I wonder what the thought process with 10 & 25 was.. why not 10 & 20
[2:53:33] damepitaa: just do flex 15-30
[2:53:39] Shredmuffn: gotta pug 5 people or bench people so annoying
[2:53:44] onkeliltis: sucked , honestly
[2:53:47] zol_zolli: never fun for those who is left out as well
[2:53:50] thcbh: HotPokket
[2:53:57] p1ss_minion_suit: true
[2:54:02] p1ss_minion_suit: feels restrictive
[2:54:13] hussletrees: yeah its more fun to bring some exotic builds
[2:54:20] stuffe92: true
[2:54:23] fouriousjorge: Place another  5 Dungeon difficulty, that makes it relevant, and do 15 and 30 man raids after that
[2:54:27] Raivan994: enhance getting the shaft again :/
[2:54:31] hussletrees: Yeah, says the cis white male
[2:54:36] Adubz1: unless ur not white
[2:54:37] onkeliltis: seq1
[2:54:39] Nythera_x: pepeLaugh
[2:54:53] rohzy__: Yeah Diversity, Classic R40 with  30warrior :D
[2:55:15] muteqqt: why ur arming this dng solo?
[2:55:20] nonvented: give us a 10 and 25man like it is with VoA would be sweet
[2:55:23] hussletrees: oof that was brutal
[2:55:31] damepitaa: @rohzy__ and 10 rogues
[2:55:55] itsKromdar: gnomer gear is crazy for warriors, so much hit
[2:55:57] vikcydoo: STV is fun when its not lag and bugs
[2:55:59] Dabtronaut: good to know
[2:56:01] HeIlraiser_: I think level 40s should get access to a weekend event for L50 gear starting tomorrow only going for 2 days YEP
[2:56:04] BlueZense: its really good for some specs
[2:56:06] Dabtronaut: Phase to level all my alts :)
[2:56:12] rohzy__: @vikcydoo And not a healer :D
[2:56:15] NutterCircus: You know its bad when people just keep their BFD gear to 40.
[2:56:18] triggs390: no gdkps no need to play anymore
[2:56:19] Arcsilin: yeah minor upgrades and the gear looks like shit
[2:56:21] Atb50: yeah, that‚Äôs how I feel about this phase
[2:56:30] BlueZense: the amount of mp5 on healing gear is crazy in gnomer
[2:56:31] Sand_vv: just level every class on both factions ez
[2:56:36] souljazz: the auto crowd pummeler is nice for future phases
[2:56:41] endraga1: yooo staysafe how we fwllin tonight
[2:56:47] Peoplewhinetoomuch: How relevant is exalted AB gear at 60?
[2:56:48] mattbarz989: thats one thing i liked about wotlk
[2:56:53] triggs390: You're describing GDKPs...
[2:56:54] triggs390: D:
[2:56:54] hussletrees: yeah and its nice to see bar go up
[2:56:55] Mattysaiyan: Didn't help Hyjal enough though NotLikeThis
[2:57:02] orrangejuiced: yup, got 0 drops on my first gnomer lol
[2:57:04] onkeliltis: PotFriend
[2:57:05] zol_zolli: dungeons that drops pvp gear is good too
[2:57:16] triggs390: So does Gold...
[2:57:32] NutterCircus: PauseChamp
[2:57:35] hussletrees: unless rep rewards suck then its insult to injury
[2:57:35] Arcsilin: and rep rewards would be cool
[2:57:36] AustralianFASTbowler: replace rep for gold and thats how gdkp works
[2:57:40] Harskare: yeah but let the raid leader loot the rep and sell it back to you :)
[2:57:51] triggs390: :(
[2:57:56] onkeliltis: Wrath did that ok imho
[2:57:56] reavethederp: what if people played cuz the content was fun
[2:57:59] ZoegaIntenzo: +++++++++++++++
[2:58:01] Humansoup: SO TRUE !!!
[2:58:14] rullehjem: They focus on RMT because that's it's something that's hard to completely eliminate
[2:58:14] Oodyny: boom
[2:58:20] Nightbot: @moooncakkes -> LANGUAGE VIOLATION [warning]
[2:58:25] seksmuhchine: make the game transactional
[2:58:37] moooncakkes: wat the heck
[2:58:43] sebfrafestegnen: Real eyez realize real lies
[2:58:58] triggs390: My bigger point was that it gives you a reason to raid and makes you feel good even if nothing drops.
[2:59:04] bindwounds: So fare i've only heard streamers that dont like Gdkp raids , us mortal people (me) Like them :P
[2:59:05] triggs390: but I get thats not the point you were making
[2:59:08] HeIlraiser_: under that ground thou monkaHmm
[2:59:36] NutterCircus: the GDKP crap almost turned the SOD servers into HC hell.
[2:59:41] Metaphix: yeah i hate them LULK
[2:59:44] rullehjem: I don't like them :)
[2:59:45] armin_ed: I fucking hate GDKP wtf
[2:59:45] sebfrafestegnen: Asmon said he like it
[2:59:46] moooncakkes: @bindwounds wrong
[2:59:46] Arawnik: I hate GDKP
[2:59:47] Eminep: I am a mere human and I hate GDKP
[2:59:48] Humansoup: Nope not me
[2:59:49] hussletrees: should we do a poll
[2:59:50] jay_ray_: fuck gdkps
[2:59:52] Mattysaiyan: Imagine thinking you speak for everyone KEKW
[2:59:53] Gealls: Mortal man here. I don't like gdkp
[2:59:55] moooncakkes: cant stand gdkp
[2:59:57] XarcTV: as a non streamer, fuck GDKPs
[2:59:58] QuestFor420: gdkps are shit
[3:00:03] HitmandanTV: gdkp is bad
[3:00:03] Fluffshock: im not a fan of anything related to gold buying, including GDKP...
[3:00:04] wookieenthal: as long as there are gold buyers, gdkps are trash
[3:00:05] Goose_Glue: my man thought he spoke for everyone @StaysafeTV lmaoo
[3:00:07] Humansoup: Phhuuuuck GDKP
[3:00:14] Aeycka__: would be interesting to see similar polling as in OSRS to be implemented in Classic
[3:00:16] endraga1: only time i ever did gdkps is when i bought gold
[3:00:19] triggs390: @wookieenthal now there are no gdkps and still gold buyers LUL
[3:00:19] Eminep: Fuck GDKP and fuck RMT
[3:00:23] Tesla369: just do jack ma runs
[3:00:23] Metaphix: @wookieenthal exactly
[3:00:25] flowqz: gdkp would be nice if they would activly ban goldbuying
[3:00:26] hussletrees: unpopular opinion: i support GDKP and Joe Biden
[3:00:27] rullehjem: YEP
[3:00:37] seksmuhchine: i've benefitted from GFKP and it's gross
[3:00:39] triggs390: @hussletrees who
[3:00:39] Bubblehealftw: what is rmt
[3:00:48] Crusar: Not a streamer, and i despise GDKPs and what they do to the game. If you are buying your gold to skip all your character progression, you are literally paying to skip the game, ruining the game economy for everyone else that actually enjoys the full game.
[3:00:48] Goose_Glue: @Bubblehealftw real money trading
[3:00:52] triggs390: @hussletrees whoa joe biden was too far
[3:00:55] Bubblehealftw: o tru
[3:00:55] bindwounds: Chat seam to think you right , so i will take that statement back sorry. But i liked them , was able to make just alittle gold as a casual player
[3:01:01] thatssteezyy: stopping gdkps will not stop people from buying gold...look at AH prices
[3:01:03] HeIlraiser_: real money tranfers tracked by discord :)
[3:01:04] Tesla369: in china they just use paypal now
[3:01:12] bayernmunchen90: if you use chrono while having dmf buff, do you reset the 4 hour timer on it then?
[3:01:21] triggs390: @bayernmunchen90 only when you unboon
[3:01:32] tex_oce: Whitemane era is a disaster
[3:01:34] NutterCircus: Just go look at AH prices on the streamer HC server.
[3:01:38] ultraangry: gdkp is just a way for swipers to get everything asap
[3:01:40] wrongbow: no i still like them
[3:01:40] hussletrees: VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[3:01:41] Fluffshock: yes
[3:01:42] triggs390: I think that the game is better with them, but I play like 5 chars. WIthout them I only play like 2.
[3:01:44] Frayeen: we still do just not sod and not gonna change it other version of wow
[3:01:50] onkeliltis: I dislike Donnie, and yeah
[3:01:52] msnedker: how much xp per hour you get by boosting'?
[3:02:00] hades_tm: alto of gdkp players/leader sell the ngold for money
[3:02:02] Crusar: I really hope so, i hope that the actual players are more than the ego measuring idiots buying all the gold and supporting all the bots.
[3:02:13] tex_oce: @msnedker xp bar of alt is above wecam
[3:02:19] BlueZense: no i think people that liked it will still miss it
[3:02:24] HeIlraiser_: normal gamers like a reason to play just like streamers even thou its not a great thing, its a job for many
[3:02:31] hussletrees: Crazy how politicized GDKP is now, you have the left supporting GDKP and conservatives opposing it
[3:02:55] ultraangry: amen Staysafe
[3:02:58] Frayeen: think he also means sr ms os runs just suck ass
[3:02:58] onkeliltis: nicely put
[3:03:00] triggs390: I really enjoyed farming the gold buying morons though
[3:03:10] pkeks13: wesleys theory gdkp
[3:03:11] cjadude: get bent
[3:03:14] lerler: The only thing that GDKPs (for me) have done being away is that instead of playing multiple chars now i only play 1, i wouldnt say thats bad or good tho im not sure
[3:03:16] Aeycka__: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD true and based
[3:03:20] KirklanSignatur: i think his point is that playing politics with guilds in order to gear more than 1 toon gets very exhausting
[3:03:20] lerler: its the only thing i can say i noticed
[3:03:24] tex_oce: my guildies were complaining about how much gold is on G2G now since the GDKP ban KEKW
[3:03:25] Smoothiez_: gdkp cant be the only enjoyment you get out of the game lol
[3:03:28] Smoothiez_: sounds so toxic
[3:03:28] triggs390: No, I still play, theres just no reason to raid as much thats all
[3:03:29] seksmuhchine: 0% for economy manipulators
[3:03:32] Crusar: My dudes, if you pay to skip content/progression in game, maybe you dont actually want to play the game? And you are doing it for the wrong reasons, find something you enjoy playing without paying for skips.
[3:03:32] Pogsible: why are you a gdkp hater?
[3:03:34] hoaxxes: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Bring back GDKP ' EEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:03:34] endraga1: how about this: all other raiding is bannable. only gdkps allowed
[3:03:37] triggs390: @Smoothiez_ nah, just gave me a reason to raid on more chars

[4:15:05] kajzanx: SHITS FUN
[4:15:09] jallaballan: STV is also better than AB because it's easy to get banned in AB by griefers. If you end up with a 5 man premade who all report you, you get automatically banned. If you write in chat you can get banned for abuse and if you just play you can get banned for non-participation. If you appeal to blizzard you get a copypasta respone

[4:31:59] spimlott: worst spot for boss here haha
[4:32:16] solstikkan: I think there‚Äôs 2 levels of boss buffs. level 1 is a skull and level 2 is a fist. look at the skull debuff you have when you‚Äôre closer to the boss
[4:33:24] johnsmith_cb: seems to me like 2 healers might be the play for this
[4:33:59] poggersshaman: the skull buff is the first buff
[4:34:13] johnsmith_cb: no
[4:34:20] solstikkan: I think the fist is when you‚Äôre closest, skull is the outer distance
[4:34:24] indiana__cones: i just fucked up the orb lock quest and got the wrong one. fml
[4:34:29] johnsmith_cb: theres skull debuff before the fist

[4:34:45] Mertauh: yeah there is a skull buff too but it might be lets say 50-100 yards away from the boss, while the fist is 50-0 yards
[4:34:50] Moo360: the longer range one is red skull in debuffs, then fist nearer
[4:34:56] johnsmith_cb: no
[4:34:59] Moo360: nope
[4:35:02] Mertauh: no
[4:35:07] Moo360: it looks like a red feign death

[6:25:20] m00n4nds74r: huge in dungeons
[6:25:37] In_Stillness: i was really disapponted they didn't just give us full spec freedom - like dual spec
[6:26:01] saltineship: phase 2 shoulda added dual spec and increased respec cost it woulda been super nice

[6:28:23] go00se: nice
[6:28:24] earlyseasoneric: if u dont have a warrior u have to heal much less and boomy is by far the best offhealer
[6:28:31] m0ng0os3: why not 58?
[6:28:33] saltineship: how much lower would the xp be if you had 2 people leveling
[6:28:50] In_Stillness: u using sleeping bag on dr00d too?

[6:29:55] saltineship: could a warlock level 2 people with this strat? or would xp be too low

[6:43:04] chri095k: @hashtagstronger Well i did, i cant shot you a video of it happen, but you can look it up. some animals eat each other, eath there babies and so on to sruvive.. my argument is simply that if you want to argue that eat meating is right becauyse nature does it, then you would have to accept rape and killing your own species as a right thing to do.. Just because nature does something, doesnt mean its right in a human context to do it. its really not a hard argument to understand., you might disagre

[8:48:20] dirbagdan: @heylowdub look at all these kids convinced they're the opposite sex because theyve been told so by their parents and teachers and everything else on the internet these days. Please dude you're lacking awareness if you think you can argue my point
[8:48:22] onkeliltis: :D
[8:48:24] sinistrydimu: They recently discovered that the cholesterol in eggs actually isn't bad for you because the way humans metabolize cholesterol in food doesn't negatively affect our hearts, it's saturated fat we gotta worry about

[8:49:14] heylowdub: @dirbagdan Do you think it could also be possible that due to society hating gay people for so long that most people were coerced to stay in the closet. Now that it's more accepted by everyone except kkonas that more people are open about it?

[8:50:33] daqqs: used what?
[8:50:57] dirbagdan: @heylowdub No, I don't. If things weren't at such a degenerate level and kids weren't being castrated and butchered, then I'd be more inclined to put more weight into your argument, but because things are so so bad, and it's like the whole world is gay or trans or some nonsense, this is not natural and I'd bet everything that it's purely manufactured

[8:52:49] dirbagdan: @sinistrydimu True, but that's always just been propaganda pushed by the mainstream health organizations. We've always known that meat, and cheese, and eggs and milk are health foods. Thinking any of that was bad for us is just crazy

[9:01:19] dirbagdan: @heylowdub Yes, but not to the extent we're seeing. If this is natural then we are fucked because it goes against everything human, to be gay. Our purpose is to reproduce and effectively that makes gayness a disorder. I don't really think that, but biologically it stands to reason. More gay people in society is a net detriment not a benefit.

[11:40:51] Loctite: AT GLOBO GYM WE KNOW WE'RE BETTER THAN YOU.
[11:40:52] NotDessx: Oh for sure lol. And most streamers don't realize they're small time as fuck even if they're big on twitch. My parents generation doesn't know any twitch streaner
[11:40:55] Junatori: i get that vid from soda
[11:40:57] hart_mk1: the shadow self
[11:40:59] Junatori: vib*
[11:40:59] 13deadace1: iknow a streamer that actively avoids her viewer count. she doesnt look at all.
[11:40:59] sweetleaf_: @Loctite LUL
[11:41:03] fart_boiii: yes thats why im now sober
[11:41:04] artilectXLII: that mostly sounds like those streamers have an unhealthy relationship with the chat
[11:41:04] LordKelris: even some temple monks still have ego @StaysafeTV
[11:41:05] Xiunitv: tru
[11:41:09] Dman2848: that's stoicism
[11:41:09] Randomguy_360: esfand once tried to stop his friend from drinking and popping pills and killing themselves he's such a bad person Madge
[11:41:10] JumboShrayump: Not me, I'm the most humble :)

[11:41:41] wavecadet: my ego doesnt have any testicales
[11:41:46] sweetleaf_: The ego can only be momentarily lost.
[11:41:50] Dman2848: ego death is actually real tho
[11:41:52] Deslok1: miz seems like an asshat
[11:42:02] artilectXLII: ...the personality that you feel your mind-voice has is the ego üôÉ
[11:42:02] LordKelris: @Dman2848 for temple monks yeah
[11:42:03] LizardoiL: To suggest you don't have an ego is egotistical in itself
[11:42:10] hart_mk1: @Dman2848 that's not stoicism
[11:42:10] wavecadet: ego death doesnt fucking mean it goes away
[11:42:11] Flaank220: i mean you could los them and fight them on the stairs
[11:42:12] pretty_cool_guy: absence of ego equates to death. need ego to eat
[11:42:12] wavecadet: thats not what it means
[11:42:13] keelew: How much fentanyl for ego death ?
[11:42:15] convictedchiller: ego death is a momentary experience
[11:42:15] daqqs: thats a from of ego
[11:42:16] Ropy123: but casters makes you look cool with frostbolt debuf, blue meta form :p

[11:42:23] bottlekiddz: egoception
[11:42:23] Wingsofjanitor: CiGrip dude I took the mushrooms and I lost all ego CiGrip
[11:42:24] Trainingtobeperson: like monks?
[11:42:35] Dman2848: i think a trip on shrooms or acid can cause it
[11:42:35] taylorsdank: if you're pretending like you have no ego, that is your ego
[11:42:35] EmanuShow: I do not have an ego i am an ego :p
[11:42:39] Plathyy: bro just smoke weed, you dont get it
[11:42:41] stonedboodah: did you just assume my ego?
[11:42:41] fart_boiii: leggo his ego
[11:42:47] BlckMrkt: can you only lose your ego if you don't acknowledge it? ü§î
[11:42:51] keelew: @Plathyy KEKL
[11:42:52] daqqs: Lego
[11:42:56] the_do0d: ego death comes from acid not weed and mushrooms
[11:42:57] soupxhot: 420BlazeIt
[11:43:03] dammitcyrus: As an alliance lock do you think Stockades is good to solo (ik cringe wow question)
[11:43:05] SL_Nerf_Herder: what if your a jobless bum in your parents basement can you not have an ego then :)
[11:43:14] fart_boiii: tru @the_do0d but also shrooms and weed
[11:43:19] fart_boiii: can
[11:43:23] EmanuShow: i respect others ego though
[11:43:28] pretty_cool_guy: YEP
[11:43:33] Trainingtobeperson: not me
[11:43:36] keelew: Joe rogan would jump in here, asking if u ever done DMT
[11:43:38] Dunder26: to many times
[11:43:41] LordKelris: Even temple monks learn to shed their ego throughout their lives. you people have no idea
[11:43:43] LordKelris: like wtf
[11:43:44] 4ddic7: kek
[11:43:45] daqqs: i used to play rugby at a decent level and my ego defo helped and hindered me in many ways

[11:43:58] DuoX: egoless
[11:43:59] testosteronald: :)
[11:43:59] soupxhot: when you buy Disney let your ego fly
[11:44:02] wiggleztv: how do i make gold while leveling when everything sells for basically vendor price at the AH Sadge
[11:44:16] artilectXLII: DMT teleports you to a different reality; go for shrooms/lsd to head for `ego-death`
[11:44:16] Xiunitv: what happened to <power>
[11:44:19] taylorsdank: took the g out your waffle all you got left is your ego
[11:44:19] seymourmoney: I think when people talk about "ego death" it's mostly refering to them coming to the realization that the have an issue with ego @StaysafeTV
[11:44:20] the_do0d: @wiggleztv buy stuff under transformation price like silk under 2s
[11:44:21] mysteriousm4n: g2g
[11:44:25] lizcat_: fishing
[11:44:29] MajesticAFx: i don‚Äôt have an ego because I‚Äôm vegan and do yoga

[11:44:37] pretty_cool_guy: 5Head
[11:44:58] testosteronald: @MadJacker15 thats wicked wtf
[11:45:09] mysteriousm4n: nothing to do after HC LK
[11:45:11] Noble_Squire: just hit 40 thru dungen lvling and do quests, which will give increased gold when ur 40
[11:45:19] Xiunitv: poor wrath
[11:45:19] lizcat_: classic is over
[11:45:25] fart_boiii: dmt takes u to the spiritual dimension
[11:45:25] Winky: im fairly certain most wrath players are done, and cata is looking grim
[11:45:38] vasily_zee: phase 1 was fun
[11:45:39] ChillyHTX: wrath is just arenas rn
[11:45:40] therealrickdiculous: @Wingsofjanitor
[11:45:45] Dman2848: cataclysm is gonna have such abysmal numbers
[11:45:46] ChillyHTX: ppl still queing at least
[11:45:47] therealrickdiculous: @Winky agreed
[11:45:47] Winky: classic is a trilogy imo
[11:45:50] Razor9mm: SoD/Classic+ is the future
[11:45:50] scivationx: Definitely, I'm not touching that
[11:45:53] 30Ktilt: best moment of wrath was you tanking XT
[11:45:53] Winky: cya next era fresh ;)
[11:45:55] Lyrian117: Cata was always looming grim lol
[11:45:57] Pudgypantss: p1 wrath was my favorite with army the dead FeelsGoodMan
[11:45:57] seymourmoney: they need to focus on sod I think
[11:45:58] keelew: history repeating itself
[11:45:59] ChillyHTX: I‚Äôm playing cata for arenas
[11:46:04] headachee: i only want to see MoP then im done
[11:46:09] Gerald_zdg: why does nobody like cata?
[11:46:13] Xiunitv: @ChillyHTX why
[11:46:21] Winky: @Gerald_zdg cata is basically retail lite
[11:46:22] Slaanesh74: @Gerald_zdg it was too hard for most people
[11:46:26] ChillyHTX: @xiunitv because pvp is end game
[11:46:27] Dman2848: cata is when subscriptions started falling off
[11:46:28] steevwtf: i stopped playing during ulduar, my guild fell apart because some people really fucking sucked at mechanics LUL
[11:46:29] keelew: only there wasn't any other version of wow back then
[11:46:34] scivationx: Are you boosting yourself?
[11:46:36] Xiunitv: @ChillyHTX cata pvp was mid
[11:46:39] fart_boiii: cata pvp>
[11:46:44] Plokoon100: yo
[11:46:46] druiddoubleice: i really enjoyed cata for what it was
[11:46:49] that_dood_bro: wow this berserk rune is a pain
[11:46:49] ChillyHTX: @xiunitv sod pvp is worse lmao
[11:46:52] skumy69: im legit just gonna level transmog my ashbringer and never play again
[11:46:57] Xiunitv: @ChillyHTX cap
[11:47:16] Pudgypantss: im interested in the direction sod is going at 60
[11:47:22] Pudgypantss: not cata
[11:47:28] steevwtf: WoW is a PvE game, New World is the best PvP game. #changemymind
[11:47:42] Winky: true
[11:47:51] Dman2848: i really hope sod turns into something much bigger. Classic + basically
[11:47:55] Winky: true and based
[11:48:14] mysteriousm4n: cata you mena?
[11:48:17] steevwtf: i miss gdkp's in SoD
[11:48:18] 25_ducats: wtf, still streaming :O
[11:48:21] Fuxtic_Actual: I think Cata is when the game really went downhill. im just not interested in cata. Ill just stay here even if I dont have anything else to do.
[11:48:25] Pudgypantss: jokrdOiler
[11:48:25] keelew: u said wrath
[11:48:29] seymourmoney: nothing beats doing content with your guild
[11:48:34] zridex: whats ur reasoning for not liking gdkp?
[11:48:46] convictedchiller: cycle path
[11:48:50] dammitcyrus: Do you think Stockades is a good solo boost for alliance locks or should i just go to RFK ?
[11:48:52] wiggleztv: @zridex gold buying YEP
[11:48:52] 13deadace1: staysafe trying to compete with peyo Kek
[11:49:02] steevwtf: saaaaaame
[11:49:05] mysteriousm4n: based
[11:49:13] Beoorc: i like loot
[11:49:27] steevwtf: i found GDKPs to be filled with better people, no cut if u fuck up and such
[11:49:33] Mattnix: It's just kinda nice that if you don't get loot atleast you're getting gold for your time.
[11:49:44] mysteriousm4n: GDKP was why I made alts in phase 1
[11:49:45] steevwtf: no gdkp = warrior trying to steal toxic revenger from rogue
[11:49:53] solstikkan: you are pumping today my man
[11:50:26] SlicexDH: GDKP is all that keeps me and my buddies playing wrath at this point @StaysafeTV
[11:50:32] 30Ktilt: GDKPS are a euro construct meant to destroy the enjoyment of game by americans
[11:50:48] scivationx: I just have always thought they were terrible for the game and I couldn't understand why someone would spend hard earned gold on gear that can be /rolled
[11:50:54] zridex: what about the take about blizzard having harsher stance over gold buying and botting
[11:51:04] Pudgypantss: yup
[11:51:04] steevwtf: not me
[11:51:07] zridex: if you are playing casually and pugging, gdkp is by far the best
[11:51:07] wookieenthal: 1000%
[11:51:08] Dman2848: if gold sellers and bots were properly taken care of then gdkps would be just fine
[11:51:13] atkos69: i just dont play alts with no gdkp
[11:51:17] wavecadet: youll get some varying resposnes from swamp if you ask
[11:51:17] keredj: People who were doing GDKPs were buying gold tho stay safe and ruining the economy
[11:51:18] atkos69: no point
[11:51:22] mysteriousm4n: that's because there have only been 2 lockouts, nobody has alts yet to do GDKP on
[11:51:24] Beoorc: i like it :)
[11:51:25] Slaanesh74: I never really cared about them.
[11:51:27] artilectXLII: what are the chances that blizz will ban GDKPs on other variants of WoW if the bot-situation is better in SoD?
[11:51:28] ThisGuyisLocal: im so poor without gdkps to be honest
[11:51:28] IR_ish: i don't care, don't play this game
[11:51:30] hart_mk1: how about 2nd hand bans on ppl who are buying/trading gold?
[11:51:32] landschock: might aswell remove the reserve system. Just go MS>OS
[11:51:33] Gerald_zdg: too early to tell
[11:51:34] SL_Nerf_Herder: didnt care about them before and i dont care that they are gone
[11:51:35] Mattnix: Just will end up playing the game less. Which is okay.
[11:51:35] Toonaww: only the swipers will miss em
[11:51:35] ThisGuyisLocal: but other than that i dont miss the spam
[11:51:37] conspiraciesgamer: gdkp is trash and ruins the value of loot
[11:51:42] Nexiee: bajs?
[11:51:53] keredj: agreed
[11:51:59] EmanuShow: How can i have a bias on it, i dont play classic?^^
[11:52:00] sourdeez: as a casual player very happy with them being removed
[11:52:02] WillowJane: the only benefit on gdkps was giving those who were guildless, gearless a chance to clear high level content for the right price
[11:52:03] therealrickdiculous: im happy theyre fighting rmt but i miss gdkps
[11:52:11] conspiraciesgamer: gold buyers that are trash at the game buy loot that they shouldn't get
[11:52:14] Dman2848: confirmation bias is the most prevalent
[11:52:16] Slaanesh74: they never really affected me. I think the person that paid for gear is not likely to start pugging.
[11:52:20] 13deadace1: greasy donkey killing people
[11:52:22] SL_Nerf_Herder: ? people cant have a neutral opinion on things that dont effect them?>
[11:52:33] keredj: exactly @cons
[11:52:47] keredj: @conspiraciesgamer I meant
[11:52:58] munjomba: munjomba is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to StaysafeTV's community! They've gifted a total of 116 in the channel!

[11:53:00] artilectXLII: ...well if you do not play the game & it does not affect you, your preference/bias could be negligible
[11:53:01] IR_ish: that is basically this stream, because they're all leaving
[11:53:02] mysteriousm4n: Pog
[11:53:02] EmanuShow: Only bias i can have on it is what others present me to it^^
[11:53:06] R3ga1: my good friends are liberals should I forgo argument for the sake of maintaining the friendship
[11:53:12] Plokoon100: ho wmuch godl you made from this

[12:24:27] hart_mk1: no one is impervious to the dangers of drugs, doesn't discriminate
[12:24:29] baurblades: @luthoo Idk if you know but heroin and fentanyl are extremely addictive and extremely painful to withdrawal off of. Most users of either of them primarily start using less dangerous heroin and then turn to fentanyl as it‚Äôs cheaper and can‚Äôt seem to get clean because of the painful withdrawals and then a lot of the times die from a stronger batch eventually
[12:24:33] steevwtf: @nerunehru truth

[12:25:17] Luthoo: @baurblades I know fent was exrtemely addictive, and used in hospitals as a pain killer. can you get addicted to it that way as well?
[12:25:25] TheEndIsNear777: if i had billions in my family, i'd be  having fun everyday, one day we go to snowboard, next day we go trail biking, next day skateboard, next week we go golfing and so on

[12:26:27] conspiraciesgamer: idaho is too expensive
[12:26:29] baurblades: @luthoo The best way to avoid addiction when using scripts is to not use scripts, or to work very hard on morals, healthy coping mechanisms, and having strong family relationships

[12:28:22] swimmingbird21: my parents did that to me when i was 10, sucked but I did end up making new ones
[12:28:33] baurblades: @luthoo Like if for example you have a surgery and get prescribed scripts, ask the doctor for any non opioid alternatives and also avoid using them in high doses and try only using them for a very short period of time.
[12:28:35] EmanuShow: Ima get some rest maybe even sleep matt
[12:29:10] stankypanky22: are you worried your neighbors will watch the stream? KEKW
[12:29:22] Henry_Ash: humble gum salesman
[12:29:40] Razor9mm: Sadge
[12:29:41] baurblades: @luthoo They CAN become psychologically addictive instantly so if you aren‚Äôt in the healthiest place you can very easily slip into the addiction trap. They become physically addictive after using opiates day after day for about 5 days
[12:29:42] Luthoo: @baurblades oh script is short for prescription im a little slow. i didnt know u could request no opioid alternatives. very useful info
[12:29:44] pretty_cool_guy: Sadge chris from my og town
[12:29:50] go00se: same here man, right into middle school
[12:29:55] ripperofbong420: see to me it would be awkward and i would imagine real life is a nice break. i say that as respectfully as possible
[12:29:56] magnaeus: can sell your child to the other family so the kids can stay together
[12:30:03] go00se: middle school is the worst too for a young kid if they don‚Äôt have friends also
[12:30:05] sirdreadeye: :(

[12:30:53] Xenocide6: I changed Elementary schools several times but stayed in the same school district, so I knew everyone by the time I got to Highschool.  It was actually nice.

[12:31:50] KCYON: @sirdreadeye it sure does. o7
[12:31:54] baurblades: @luthoo my life was pretty low and ended up getting into opiates thru friends and a girlfriend. That eventually led to heroin and then fentanyl. Overdosed twice(nearly died). It ruined my life, nearly lost my son. was using for 4 years living in my car. Now I‚Äôm nearly 2 years clean and I‚Äôve almost got my son back and I have my own apartment and a full time job.
[12:31:56] Wrettchh: got a full nights sleep and this gamer still gaming Pog

[12:33:42] Fuxtic_Actual: makes it sound like you sell drugs
[12:33:44] baurblades: @luthoo Opiod withdrawals won‚Äôt kill you, but you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre dying and wish you were dead. Your mind and body absolutely crave opiates and you‚Äôll do nearly anything to just feel relief. When withdrawing you cannot sleep, eating sucks, and you can‚Äôt sit still without muscle spasms and some people have diarrhea for weeks.
[12:33:45] Luthoo: @baurblades holy shit man that i AMAZING you were able to turn your life around. ik im a stranger but im proud of you. sounds like you had a very rough journey but you've come a long way. absolutely good shit you give me hope for myself

I at some points completely gave up on parenting but certain moments I felt an overwhelming sense that I could not give up and let my baby boy go. He deserves his father. Sadly his mother is still struggling, using everyday and living in her car.

[14:35:27] ExileXVIII: you should be able to get exalted with WSG by doing ashenvale
[14:35:29] Wingsofjanitor: peepoRun he's going so fast!!
[14:35:29] its_mike: its 8% thats what the speed gives you
[14:35:29] infinatis12: it's not much
[14:35:34] Vicente_Prime: only when you follow someone
[14:35:36] fun5iz3: Does it stack with speed enchant?
[14:35:41] Dman2848: run in meta form you'll see it
[14:35:42] chintack: its like 3% pretty sure
[14:35:43] TheFreedomLover: im looking forward to your r14 grind :-D
[14:35:49] numblezzz: @ExileXVIII the weekly turn in goes to exalted atleast
[14:35:53] zathonian94: ECS should show the %
[14:36:08] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: what class is best DPS
[14:36:09] fushyumangg: do ab boots stack with run speed enchant?
[14:36:18] cjadude: Jesus you‚Äôve been grinding
[14:36:19] summerteeth: laser chicken form soon
[14:36:26] daughtylock: Should of sat them in an inn
[14:36:34] its_mike: its exactly 8% unless it was changed later on. i made a speed set in draenor and those boots provided 8% speed increase. just like minor movement speed.
[14:36:34] HouDeanii: what did that do?
[14:36:43] Smoothiez_: if u waited to pop it at 39 you would have gotten about 1000 extra xp
[14:36:51] Dman2848: it added 4 bubbles of rested xp
[14:36:54] that_dood_bro: ABDULpls
[14:37:01] HouDeanii: aaah. cool
[14:37:18] HoustonSippers: Is it worth saving them for later phases?
[14:37:21] dirbagdan: 5 from bag 3 from another quest
[14:37:23] HoustonSippers: gotcha
[14:37:27] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: im saving mine for 60
[14:37:38] Frantixofficial: or use them to parse
[14:37:39] DarkNightShad0w: Your boots its like the Enchant Boots Tuskarr‚Äôs Vitality from wotlk
[14:37:40] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: why not?
[14:37:46] GoldenFool69: They'll probably give more of them in later phases
[14:37:48] reefo: rested xp can use all phase, guartaneed
[14:37:52] lordextraordinary: worth saving to parse, gain health,mana,rage,energy
[14:37:59] fietsopa4: I disagree I think they will allow it
[14:38:03] Vicente_Prime: BOXES?
[14:38:04] Vicente_Prime: LMAO
[14:38:10] Ariosity: creates a win conndition for world first in future phases
[14:38:14] Vicente_Prime: boxes winkyface
[14:38:19] englishurza: pre quest???
[14:38:21] Uberzerk: Even quests?
[14:38:21] HouDeanii: thats good
[14:38:24] Kryptiiq: yes :)
[14:38:28] reefo: ppl didn't get it till 40
[14:38:30] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: i wonder why they care
[14:38:30] Mr_Moffert: kinda annoying that you need to use twitter to get SOD information
[14:38:41] einself111: sounds good
[14:38:48] reefo: ya i'm saving mine
[14:38:52] reefo: idc about 30-40
[14:38:53] wilsonlewis: Cheer100 What do you think of SOD on a track to be more like retail than classic? Seems like it is headed towards another AOE fest with no class identity
[14:38:54] Jpbadger: this question every day... xD
[14:38:56] fietsopa4: I respectfully disagree
[14:38:56] cjadude: damn so no waylaid strat again
[14:38:56] KaiserTex: opportunity cost dictates you save them
[14:38:57] daughtylock: Just like how they said the crates would not work
[14:38:58] englishurza: i got 40 without slep bag...?
[14:39:04] zathonian94: so would the fidder have a max level use?
[14:39:09] ScootSmith: where do you think the next raid will be for the next phase???
[14:39:19] ScootSmith: my money is on ZF, mara, or ST
[14:39:23] OrganikCum: battle pets
[14:39:25] summerteeth: gay dragons
[14:39:26] NutterCircus: Its stupid.
[14:39:26] englishurza: loot rules suck in retail
[14:39:27] SippinSimpSyrup: everything
[14:39:28] numblezzz: classes can have a lot of complexity and overlap with other classes while still having "identity"
[14:39:28] madgarlicjr: to many mounts
[14:39:28] Milanesa_De_Pollo: too many furries
[14:39:29] troobii: forced gameplay
[14:39:29] doctorranall: On my way at level 15 to get sleeping bag on my 3rd character
[14:39:29] summerteeth: and that to
[14:39:39] its_mike: retail is just bad
[14:39:40] yiannos1979: for me is the fucking dragons
[14:39:41] HouDeanii: @ScootSmith Mara I feel
[14:39:41] kelo__95: BASED
[14:39:42] revora_: I'm thinking phase 3 will have another cool questline like the sleeping bag and will reward those items but for 40+
[14:39:47] Icecolddonut: Flying ruins it
[14:39:48] Dman2848: hope the next raid is mara. I hate sunken temple
[14:39:50] Moo360: world size too
[14:39:59] Shocklate_: Retail game content is great but the world sucks dick
[14:39:59] troobii: Forced gameplay
[14:40:04] numblezzz: retail has terrible reward saturation. there is nothing to grind to in an RPG sense, its all just handed to you
[14:40:10] carlos_the_7th: it's a very instanced game yeah
[14:40:10] VenomVeinZ: its flying flying should be removed
[14:40:12] Moo360: having retail abilities in classic wow is still classic wow just with extra shit
[14:40:17] ScootSmith: @Dman2848 I love sunken temple, not the biggest fan of mara xD
[14:40:18] Shocklate_: Funmaxxing GIGACHAD
[14:40:23] SwedishRepresentative: If classes don't play like dogshit anymore, that means it feels more like retail
[14:40:32] cjadude: HAVING FUN
[14:40:34] SippinSimpSyrup: i dont like what they did with my class tbh
[14:40:34] Smokjoker: YEP
[14:40:34] Shocklate_: I'd love to see ST as the level 50 raid
[14:40:34] summerteeth: so much fun
[14:40:36] reefo: haing a blast
[14:40:42] Moo360: sod has been a huge success imo
[14:40:43] pepego2: Fun Clueless
[14:40:50] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: will u play next retail expanssion?
[14:40:53] MajesticAFx: SeemsGood
[14:41:03] glenncloseisaman: i had fun with this content 10 years ago, today no, need new content
[14:41:04] ScootSmith: @Moo360 it surpassed my expectations for sure, and we arent even done!
[14:41:11] summerteeth: YEP correct
[14:41:22] ScootSmith: agreed
[14:41:25] Dman2848: all they need to do to sod is add arenas and it would be complete imo
[14:41:29] BluntstepTV: classic era > all
[14:41:31] englishurza: why tbc ?
[14:41:33] summerteeth: it
[14:41:36] fietsopa4: ff14 does that
[14:41:38] TwoDancingLobsters: yuh
[14:41:38] summerteeth: it's pretty fuckin good
[14:41:39] numblezzz: @Dman2848 agreed
[14:41:41] Plokoon100: D: YOU SAID IT
[14:41:41] Arathionn: Hardcore wow did it best though
[14:41:43] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: @fietsopa4 YEP
[14:41:43] cnycmympuk: so fly mounts the reason?
[14:41:47] Randomguy_360: nah ff14 world is dead
[14:41:47] TwoDancingLobsters: I thnk the lvl bands also help
[14:41:50] ReDNeQ_tm: Sir. Seriously, your grind... how in the hell fam. Kudos
[14:41:52] moby_slick: STV bis
[14:41:53] lordextraordinary: STV event is really fun
[14:41:55] chintack: yeah im a fan of stv
[14:41:55] DarkNightShad0w: @cnycmympuk yes
[14:41:55] sirbillyy: flying mounts killed wow
[14:41:58] pretty_cool_guy: yeah i like it
[14:41:58] HoustonSippers: Ashenvale event was still like PvE
[14:42:04] HoustonSippers: STV is actually PvP
[14:42:05] pk99: flying mounts huge L
[14:42:05] zathonian94: i wish the ashenvale was more like the STV event
[14:42:06] sirbillyy: what else?
[14:42:11] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: if there was 1 region with flying mounts, that would be fun gimmick
[14:42:14] TwoDancingLobsters: the lvl caps are myfav too
[14:42:25] ardice1: does the speed to boots enchant stack with your movement speed on boots
[14:42:28] esbi__: STV is only hell in prime hours cuz of layering problem, event on it's own is really fun
[14:42:30] Moo360: also adding a new part of the world every expansion that invalidated the rest of the map was not great
[14:42:34] makitahq: Ashenvale PVP is like AV PVP
[14:42:35] smander: it gives stealthies such an advantage since u get blood on kill so all u have to do is pop out and snag people a low health. a friend was almost at 1k kills doing this in a full stealth group
[14:42:37] ardice1: damn
[14:42:39] ardice1: ok
[14:42:39] ScootSmith: would you rather ground mounts get faster or just stay the same without flying @StaysafeTV  ??
[14:42:43] ardice1: yeah stan
[14:42:44] SippinSimpSyrup: thats dumb
[14:42:45] ardice1: stam*
[14:42:46] parsile: i really like the interation between boxes and professions
[14:42:54] DubPoizon: do you think is possible to pull back some tbc/wotlk content (raids/dungeons) into SoD, or just brand new content completely?
[14:42:56] Luthoo: how fast should i find all my runes im lvl 9
[14:43:09] HouDeanii: @smander full stealth group sounds fun. Have thought of 5 hunters too
[14:43:10] dougMarshal: !spec
[14:43:10] Nightbot: MY SOLO DUNGEON SPEC: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/5500253002201005
[14:43:11] artilectXLII: ...dungeon-boosting is negatively impacting world-immersion; what if blizz ruined dungeon-levelling meta in the next phase?
[14:43:12] numblezzz: they will do new stuff
[14:43:13] harpdarp: Does the rep return work after Revered?
[14:43:18] summerteeth: that wouldn't really work well imo
[14:43:33] Icecolddonut: @Luthoo Depends what ur doing. if you're a balance druid you should drop everything and go get Starsurge for example
[14:43:36] exequtegg: @StaysafeTV i'm pretty sure we're running on the wotlk client with SOD with just some changes.
[14:43:42] ShingaTV: true and based
[14:43:43] Dman2848: i hope they do karazhan crypts at 60
[14:43:44] Randomguy_360: karazhan crypts is coming
[14:43:46] Randomguy_360: at some point
[14:43:46] vibes819: they will
[14:43:48] ardice1: yea this
[14:43:48] Nytsongx: SM raid wouldve been amazing
[14:43:48] arsonnic: i hope they just use all the unused raid portals / locations. classic kara, azshara raid portal etc..
[14:43:50] Hitacha: For sure, but its a good first attempt.
[14:43:51] summerteeth: NODDERS
[14:43:55] numblezzz: i'd bet money on furbolg raid at the least. so easy to make that
[14:43:56] matthewz92: i think sod is just for experimenting
[14:43:57] grylz89: Agreed. I think the new content will comes at 60 endgame.
[14:43:58] reefo: they are reusing assets
[14:43:59] Bruhbarian: We have so much content, like Hyjal which you can't even click on and the hidden dungeon entrance in winterspring
[14:44:02] airthayer2k16: MOUNT HYJAL WILL BE OPEN DONT WORRY
[14:44:02] tbseason: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/phase-list-updated-2024-season-of-discovery/ YOOO they announced theyre going to add 60 content after naxx including Karazhan and Utgarde Keep!!
[14:44:02] lordextraordinary: You never visit Gnomeregan tho. Didnt visit once during classic, hate it. The raid is fun tho :D
[14:44:03] zathonian94: kara crypts, old emerald dream, new olg god content
[14:44:05] eraser9: Hakkar Temple Raid.
[14:44:05] Plathyy: discover botanica PogU again PogU
[14:44:08] cronos2015: I've never done this. I've never played vanilla
[14:44:08] HouDeanii: Grim batol would actually be ok. since it is in wetlands already
[14:44:10] Nooticer: quick alga
[14:44:10] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: doing remakes is the meta in both games and movies
[14:44:11] sirbillyy: @StaysafeTV have they said what will be new at lvl 60 in sod>
[14:44:12] Kryptiiq: You excited to do molten core again?
[14:44:14] infinatis12: they might give kara before new stuff
[14:44:17] DarkNightShad0w: HYPERS New Raids
[14:44:25] airthayer2k16: MOUNT HYJAL CLASSIC VERSION WILL BE OPENED UP
[14:44:30] zathonian94: karazhan crypts is a massive area
[14:44:31] grylz89: There will 1000% chance be a Kara crypts and scarlet themed 60 raid in sod
[14:44:47] botjuan1: yeah karazhan xrypts is a really cool and immersive zone
[14:44:48] Smoothiez_: in the expansion after wod we did
[14:44:50] ScootSmith: the boostkin bb
[14:44:51] Smoothiez_: cant say the word lol

[14:44:59] summerteeth: give me new SC content man please
[14:44:59] xremusmh: what to do when you reach 40? im 39 now
[14:45:00] Ninq_: actual new places instead of reworked stuff
[14:45:01] dirbagdan: tyrs hand or hearthglen
[14:45:01] Dman2848: there's also an instance portal behind a gate in stormwind that has always been there. Could that turn into anything?
[14:45:02] Qeevdo: reuse hearthglen HYPERS
[14:45:04] lordextraordinary: Tyrs hand entrance
[14:45:10] tbseason: just ask a mage when youre there
[14:45:10] Plokoon100: Scarlett raid.. the Entrance is at Gelndale
[14:45:11] king_lizard_wizard: in the interview with comebackkid they said karazan isnt on the roadmap, it was leaked at blizzcon as a vision
[14:45:12] Grimadin: could have all wings as the raid
[14:45:12] HoustonSippers: I heard they might connect all 4 dungeon maps
[14:45:16] HoustonSippers: I hope they dont
[14:45:18] realmalfurionsr: @StaysafeTV Caverns of Time?
[14:45:20] eraser9: grim batol
[14:45:22] DubPoizon: I agree, new content
[14:45:22] ScootSmith: My guess is you will go throught cath or something, then there will be another entrance to the new dungeon/raid
[14:45:28] zathonian94: @StaysafeTV in the paladin rune quest lines you have alot of them tied into the scarlet crusade and you save a guy that says there is more to come
[14:45:34] Fiegi07: in one of there interviews they said those were just ideas weren't necessarily using them
[14:45:35] dubskimcgee: hearthglen in EPL
[14:45:35] justlootzhs: GRIM BATOL RAID Please blizzard
[14:45:36] KLunte: they said that about SM
[14:45:38] KLunte: not kara
[14:45:39] matthewz92: to maintain real classic+ they need a bigger classic team for sure
[14:45:40] xremusmh: what do do once you hit 40?
[14:45:42] lordextraordinary: The tainted Scar
[14:45:43] dreadd39: allow the scarlet to cleanse the plaguelands and let the entire zone become a huge scarlet zone with towns and a city. 3rd faction
[14:45:45] 30Ktilt: I hope they build a giant walmart and strip mall area/raid
[14:45:49] jallaballan: i think stratholm is coming as raid, two wings
[14:45:53] shiggydoo43: the random thing
[14:45:55] Icecolddonut: @xremusmh Strangle thorn and raid log
[14:45:57] Smoothiez_: it teleports you to random places, not just kara

[14:46:25] Ariosity: update atlasloot it lists loot by boss now
[14:46:25] einself111: they did not say it was not coming they said it was "just" a vision
[14:46:26] zathonian94: Aragriear's Whimsical World Hopper
[14:46:26] arsonnic: you gotta update your atlasloot, it shows specific boss drops now
[14:46:28] theguyinthehoodie420: and it doesnt only port u there

[14:47:03] Smoothiez_: it teleports you to random places, not just kara.
[14:47:04] OptimusBanana420: it goes to random locations
[14:47:04] lordextraordinary: yes its random
[14:47:04] pursuitjr: not just one location
[14:47:10] tbseason: @Nytsongx another addon to add SoD to Atlas
[14:47:10] Goncalvo: I hope the do the Azshara battleground or world pvp there
[14:47:10] shiggydoo43: i also saw an interview where they said all that shit at blizzcon is ideeas not commitments
[14:47:12] noshot_bucko: monkaX

[14:47:32] slug_22: is a drop on electrocutioner 6000
[14:47:33] theguyinthehoodie420: a hill in burning steps
[14:47:36] airthayer2k16: MT HYJAL WILL COME
[14:47:47] LocoPollo1: They should do SM raid and Dire maul raid
[14:47:49] nutwerthmaximus: that is exactly what it is
[14:47:49] lordextraordinary: future Rune spot locations
[14:47:49] reefo: hyjal at 60 yes
[14:47:51] reefo: ST for 50
[14:47:55] Shocklate_: Sunken Temple radi would be the tits
[14:47:55] reefo: is my guess
[14:47:57] otp_vallentin: Somewhere in winderspring aswell.. our tank clicked it while in the raid
[14:47:59] carlosantonioar: how did u get ab rep so fast? =D
[14:48:00] realmalfurionsr: Uldum?
[14:48:02] nutwerthmaximus: it has 0 purpose but to ponder
[14:48:08] illnastyyy: we talk about it = they take the good ideas :)
[14:48:09] numblezzz: the biggest question is how they can monetize sod without pissing people off monkaHmm
[14:48:10] WillowJane: if you update atlasloot it shows on the table for electrocutioner 6000
[14:48:15] realmalfurionsr: maybe they take our attention away from actual spots they arent having us visit?
[14:48:29] Shocklate_: yea nah, Kara should be a 60 raid and all new
[14:48:29] qithlorien: blizzard said no one found hidden stuff in phase one yet
[14:48:38] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Do you think the Karazhan crypts connect to the Stormwind tunnels they recently discovered?
[14:48:42] summerteeth: new zones PogU
[14:48:43] zathonian94: Aragriar's Whimsical World Hopper - it drops from electrocustioner
[14:48:45] airthayer2k16: HYJAL IS ReADY TO GO BRAND NEW ZONE
[14:48:54] carlosantonioar: how did get ab rep so fast
[14:48:58] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: i think the entire point of classic is for blizzard to reuse old content
[14:48:59] ScootSmith: how do you think they would do a new zone?? just add on to one of the continents or like a new island or something?
[14:49:00] gxniusx: @qithlorien when?
[14:49:00] HouDeanii: how would you add a new zone when they showed that back when cata came out?
