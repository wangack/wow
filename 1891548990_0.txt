[1:25:11] nitefalltv: tanks are good, but AUG needs the delete button hit LOL
[1:26:58] captivate7: 10.2 would probably come out after Blizzcon right?
[1:27:44] luckfore: would be kind of weird to still be on a .1 patch while the new expac gets announce
[1:27:51] herzlustafir: i really look forward to blizzcon this year i have a good feeling about it
[1:28:35] nitefalltv: Switch AUG to a tank spec
[1:29:27] soge131: I think we were supposed to get it in 10.0 but they didn't have the time to release it, and it would've make no sense to release an Evoker spec next expansion
[1:29:54] magecookiez: Oh shit. Towelliee!

[1:30:58] NickLeonhearth: I'm ok with ppl re-rolling every month to play the flavor of the month getting fucked by nerfs, its fun to watch
[1:31:04] magecookiez: But we’re figuring shit out
[1:31:05] carmelchaos: What's the point of having a support role like Aug then if blizzard just shoots themselves in the foot then? A game like wow relies too much on meters for it to work :/
[1:31:49] TheRiwen: Just make pi personal
[1:32:12] shav88: Does he have to cross the chains or go to the spear?
[1:32:37] soge131: The only problem I see with Augmentation is the current lack of other support specs
[1:32:37] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:32:37] Teunskii: Combine the evoker with a ret paladin aswell and your zooming
[1:32:51] magecookiez: Really agree with what you said about the stats and the data
[1:33:43] PadidinJones: @Towelliee are there seriously problems with Aug evokers?
[1:33:59] Ryathael: Nah, big issue with Aug, is that they're either  gonna have to nerf it for other  support to work,  or make other supports AS STRONG, to even make it worth taking them.
[1:34:00] Nicstar1007: Hope Discipline Priest get support
[1:34:15] PadidinJones: Druids need a 5th spec LUL
[1:34:34] fewyn: evoker is fun still finding it hard to measure my own performance though
[1:34:56] Nebulizer87: funnily enough Aug got another lovetap nerf they still meta
[1:34:59] soge131: Elves are the anime fans of WoW
[1:35:28] Teunskii: What you think about prot paladin?
[1:35:29] Wcvechten: I need my weekly 8% blood buffs man
[1:35:32] Nebulizer87: tanks this whole xpac have been pretty great
[1:36:48] itzzjustquinn: @Towelliee are you always a tank?
[1:37:01] magecookiez: Idk if I’m tin foil but I feel like we might be relying to heavily on numbers and algorithms. There’s stuff that looks great on paper but won’t really play well
[1:37:21] Sollice: That’s what Naowh said he was getting ready to roll was blood

[1:38:05] rosina_scarlett: I just know before Aug teams where getting ready with Fury warriors for some keys
[1:38:18] TheRiwen: Have had some bad druid tanks there just take a lot of dmg.
[1:38:34] itzzjustquinn: !commands
[1:38:42] soge131: Naowh said he would like tanks to be as strong as bear is currently in the sense of being able to stay in the pull without kiting if played correctly, and tbh, I agree, it'd nice

[1:55:51] magecookiez: I’m aging over here
[1:56:22] Nebulizer87: the d4 patch notes were very underwhelming
[1:56:23] PapaDatto: I love my sorc but keep running out of mana sadge
[1:56:32] magecookiez: People are mad about S1 lol
[1:56:54] Blas0n: @Towelliee yeah i've lost total interest in the game.. Honestly more excited about PoE

[1:57:10] Blas0n: I mean diablo
[1:57:29] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee They should have waited longer to release the season.  Let the initial hype run off... it was too soon... TOO SOON EXECUTUS
[1:57:45] magecookiez: How did they come out with a patch and make the game worse lol
[1:58:01] magecookiez: That surprised me
[1:58:17] jamarky23: every new patch is gonna be followed up by a dmg control stream LUL

[2:00:17] jamarky23: big true
[2:00:23] Ramstein: I stopped playing D4 in the "Early Access" that's how AWFUL the slog felt. They've already lost me because the Season didn't "Save" the game. ResidentSleeper @Towelliee

[2:01:08] Blas0n: @Towelliee Ill be deep into Cata raids by the time POE2 drops
[2:01:12] medanmarko: The only thing that can kill D4 is D4. The same goes for WoW. Which is why both will never happen. I'm a die hard PoE fanboy but we have to face the reality. PoE is made for a specific type of crowd, whereas D4 is not.
[2:01:21] maustercheese: cause if they don't pull up something in that time..
[2:01:35] magecookiez: Clip it boys
[2:01:42] GitaxiasPrime: PoE 2 will be the death of D4
[2:01:54] Darwoo: D4 will be the death of D4
[2:02:10] GitaxiasPrime: yeah you right lmao

[2:02:16] Blas0n: I agree with you there @Towelliee im not a fan of that kinda combat
[2:02:17] TheGiant99: The thing is 100 is just a destination. Nothing unlocks other then Uber Lilith at 100....

[2:04:23] Nokterian: I am gonna try sorc when the patch hits

[2:05:15] PigPenLen: @TheGiant99 yeah i agree with this too, i'm not "trying" to get to 100 so I don't see the slog either

[2:10:17] ItsNobbie: I don't play wow hc because my shaman cannot use his ankh
[2:10:17] Blas0n: What do they do with Aug evoker then @Towelliee ?
[2:10:22] Blas0n: Just remake the spec? or delte it
[2:10:23] HopeThePriest: Why do you say its a failure?
[2:10:24] Z3azza: whats your opinions on nerfing god comp this week
[2:10:24] Ramstein: @Towelliee b-b-but the HOLY TRINITY MiniK

[2:10:44] abracka_: #makesurvivalhunteratankspec
[2:10:49] Denohar: i like support classes but it just feels too late
[2:10:50] JeemTeam: nope, should of just given us tank spec, support spec was a mistake
[2:10:55] magecookiez: Giving us stuff no one asked for lol
[2:10:57] ThePawPaw: warlock becoming support KEKW
[2:11:03] Sepulchair: Just to balance Frost Dk to 2 hander seemed to be challenging
[2:11:04] PrimalRain: make shaman and pally support again ;p
[2:11:08] TheMajinLuke: Wasn't vanilla shammy kinda support?
[2:11:13] Cabbageman007: 100% Agree..they are nerfing all the other classes too keep the viability of Auggie
[2:11:14] TheMajinLuke: windfury etc
[2:11:15] Sepulchair: Seems good now though
[2:11:38] TheGiant99: Survival hunter as a tank would be dope
[2:11:39] Alienfromger: new classes and specs are fresh wind for mmorpgs
[2:11:52] MarkoLee78: I think making dungeons a 6man content would be fucking awesome IF they wanna go down the support route
[2:11:53] ThePawPaw: @TheGiant99 nope BM better
[2:11:58] TheItalianStallion321: 10.2 raid balance is going to be HYSTERICAL to see

[2:13:02] doomester: @Towelliee DH support class :)
[2:13:09] TheItalianStallion321: hey i love my aug evoker. i get invited almost instantly. my DH which has similar #s IO, ilvl, i have to fight my way to get invited to a key
[2:13:38] botscast: i see them nerfing aug and turning it to more of a dps than releasing multiple new support specs
[2:13:49] Affiiance: I mean they knew the tuning nightmare they were opening up. They still chose to put it in
[2:13:50] MarkoLee78: @TheItalianStallion321 Now thats a problem. It is because of the AUG meta why you cant get into keys as a melee.
[2:13:51] ArcaneMaki: My hope is they change Aug spec to finally just be another healing spec and fix the tuning issue.
[2:13:58] Nebulizer87: The fel infuser
[2:13:59] TheRiwen: They will nerf shadow priest. But then there will just be another class there will be meta
[2:14:01] Denohar: 5 spec druid when Kappa
[2:14:04] Cabbageman007: <Liquid> and <Echo> will highlight the stupidity of Auggie in next race..probably 7 on each team?
[2:14:09] redbulladin: Fel healing haha
[2:14:17] dscholl82: frost mages making water.  The OG support class
[2:14:18] TheItalianStallion321: @MarkoLee78 i agree with you 100%.
[2:14:58] TheGiant99: Mage table best support item
[2:15:36] cruzeal: healers love mage tables lol
[2:15:51] TheItalianStallion321: imagine playing a DH for the past 6 years or so and never getting a 3rd spec. meanwhile evoker was within 2 patches, getting a 3rd spec
[2:16:04] TheGiant99: Towelliee how do you feel with how the Colts are treating Taylor

[2:17:53] Colt_Engineer: are ya prepping?
[2:17:54] TheItalianStallion321: if you call it a rotation
[2:17:55] ArcaneMaki: I would change it to a 2nd healing spec or something like Priest have.
[2:18:35] TRi_GallowS: they wont ever do glad warrior again, but then they do aug.

[2:37:13] QuigsTV: @Colt_Engineer the highest M+ keys possible
[2:37:26] kevdeckie: I like watching the casters.  You miss allot of audio info from the stream when you are watching Max's stream.
[2:38:11] Colt_Engineer: @QuigsTV so why don't they just call it the highest keys? the great push sounds like a story about taking a shit in the morning
[2:38:26] mawrgg: tettles, meeix, dratnos, Doa
[2:39:05] TheItalianStallion321: isnt it naguura and xyronic as well?
[2:39:35] QuigsTV: @Colt_Engineer Its cause they push keys from a lower to higher level. So for exapmle this dungeon Towelliee is in might start at a +24 but theyll push until its no longer possible to time on a tournament realm
[2:39:39] mawrgg: the watch party with Max, Dorki, Jac and others is a fun listen haha

[2:41:22] Colt_Engineer: @TheItalianStallion321 I loved it when he got banned from twitch when he typed, "sit on my face" in ninja's chat during a stream one time lol
[2:41:41] TheItalianStallion321: he called people who dont work out noodle arm bitches
[2:42:04] TheItalianStallion321: yeah i think its the 1st time

[3:09:05] smashwow: yeah he's enhance
[3:09:27] Mesuxso: Tank trinket is good for high fortified keys in some instances, but slightly overkill until you hit those +24, +25 keys

[3:12:19] Mesuxso: @Ramstein Yeah, i remember watching justin.tv haha!
[3:12:45] TheItalianStallion321: and it was meta only b/c havoc was so bad in the beginning of shadowlands they needed 5% magic

[3:14:53] Contendedlemon: i cant even drink in peace as a healer when its consistant in combat
[3:15:30] Mesuxso: and they're actually super tanky in m+ atm, im still stuck playing havoc in raid tho xd

[3:18:05] TheItalianStallion321: im telling you. i was just declined to about 10 keys right now on my havoc. i will swap to my evoker, which both classes have similary IO, ilvl, gear. and my evoker will get invited instantly
[3:18:16] TheItalianStallion321: im talking 16s
[3:18:42] Mesuxso: @TheItalianStallion321 thats the power of the meta
[3:18:57] TheItalianStallion321: its so impossible to get into pug keys on my DH
[3:19:12] Mesuxso: Go veng! ;D
[3:19:18] Mallaes: coxWat
[3:19:41] TheItalianStallion321: the sad part is, i will probably do more dps than others in the group but no one wants me

[3:20:02] TheRiwen: I just do my own key
[3:20:07] Skyrat22: Hi chat, I am new to WoW and I am really struggling with all of the abilities and rotations for Mage. Are there any other classes you guys can recommend that are easier to play?
[3:20:18] TheItalianStallion321: its so sad Towel, it is
[3:20:29] maalow: people are just dumb, not using even 1 brain cell
[3:20:32] veloss1: 10.2 prep? isnt 10.0.7 coming first?
[3:20:35] Mallaes: I would take a good tank player any day over someone who only plays a specific spec because it's meta
[3:20:57] TheItalianStallion321: thats the mentality of the idiots running these keys.
[3:20:59] Mallaes: @veloss1 For next tier/season
[3:21:01] maalow: they just pull up a tierlist and follow it blindly
[3:21:03] Nebulizer87: @Skyrat22 download the addon Hekili it would help you a lot if you are new with rotations
[3:21:05] TheItalianStallion321: honestly, this community sucks for pugs
[3:21:24] angahax: To be fair Druid is the easiest tank to play
[3:21:24] TheItalianStallion321: "bring the player, not the class" has been out the window since like WoD
[3:21:30] veloss1: @Mallaes oh ok isnt that a while away?
[3:21:59] Vorty2X: its the same thing with lost ark always going to be gatekeeping in mmos unfort
[3:22:02] TheItalianStallion321: @Skyrat22 i honestly dont know, i would say evoker but i dont think you can make 1
[3:22:04] Mallaes: @veloss1 It is.
[3:22:13] laggy_cs: yo @Towelliee bear is meta
[3:22:17] TheItalianStallion321: @Skyrat22 im not good with ranged classes but Evoker
[3:22:20] BitsyOD: pay people to tell others that ret is the best dps spec
[3:22:55] Mesuxso: Is it that bad over there in the US? I get into +20s on all my chars, but then again, im playing vdh/bear/balance/evoker/rsham
[3:23:05] CardinalTX: Playing Everquest years ago thats the way it was. No meters or addons or bullshit. Just people killing bosses
[3:23:09] rbgdev: When does 10.2 come out?
[3:23:11] TheItalianStallion321: EU isnt as toxic as NA apparently
[3:23:16] Nebulizer87: with all the reworks, i love all 3 pally specs atm
[3:23:18] BitsyOD: ik i main ret thats why if the internet didnt exist like now id pay people to tell others
[3:23:21] TheItalianStallion321: b/c NA will literally follow the meta, and only the meta
[3:23:27] dirtydeus: I struggle to get into keys as Brew sometimes
[3:23:30] TheItalianStallion321: i just saw a key asking for AUG AND GUARDIAN ONLY
[3:23:31] TheItalianStallion321: bruh
[3:23:34] TheItalianStallion321: its a 16

[3:24:00] Mesuxso: hahaha, we get those in EU as well @TheItalianStallion321 but its usually from 22s and up
[3:24:02] Nebulizer87: meta is a philosophical problem with games being so competitive nowadays every damn game has a 'meta' issue
[3:24:05] TheItalianStallion321: @maalow exactly lol
[3:24:22] TheItalianStallion321: people want metas for 11s in the US

[3:24:45] Nebulizer87: even in gw2 you can be kicked from fractals and raids for not being a meta spec
[3:25:02] veloss1: i want wow with no ratings
[3:25:07] mattack10: you are correct on that
[3:25:09] TheItalianStallion321: see what i mean? i was just kicked from a group
[3:25:12] Zythron2: there def is
[3:25:20] TheRealGecika: I just wanna explore how to play without needing to study a build guide
[3:25:22] BitsyOD: calling us old now? thanks
[3:25:41] reggiepowa: for hall of fame yes but you dont need meta for cutting edge
[3:26:03] Mesuxso: Are you still in that jesters guild? I dont remember the name
[3:26:29] ahies28: Shade
[3:26:33] CardinalTX: Ive been playing WoW since launch. Have never done a M+.....just cant be bothered to mess with that crowd
[3:26:45] darkkilla1: the issue with the current meta though is unless they nerf mage/spriest/aug to the ground they are never gonna move from meta. They are meta partially because of their synergy
[3:26:55] MuffinVsMuffin: wat guild are you in now
[3:27:00] Mesuxso: Hahaha, yeah, sorry, I havent been in here for a good while :D

[3:55:03] Se7enthSinn: outside of that lol
[3:55:10] TheItalianStallion321: a 420 in a 16
[3:55:12] zeiours: @towelliee It's nice with a controller, turns into a 3rd person game, instead of over the top
[3:55:18] Contendedlemon: even purchasing the game helps the developers out anyways if you like it or not
[3:55:25] Darwoo: you not suppoed to reload save :P
[3:55:50] Buddahphil: What new games r coming out
[3:55:54] zinbers: It got 500’000 active users
[3:56:03] Molvonos: Here come the gatekeepers.
[3:56:34] zinbers: For now that can drop or grow over time
[3:56:35] Gungre: It's called "save scumming" but who actually gives a fuck if you reload save every fight, decision, whatever. Play the fucking game how you wanna play it, not adhere to people's "oh you can't do this", fuck that
[3:56:59] Galoari: the game can be (and prolly should :p) way more casual that what u are describing. but I it can be slow even then, so it makes sense to not enjoy it
[3:57:08] reggiepowa: reminded me of ff14 players whenever someone says something negative about that game
[3:57:46] jarilrpg: @zinbers it hit over 700k
[3:57:55] Darwoo: @Gungre well it's DnD ruleset
[3:58:18] LuiBMHunter: no dice in the movie :(
[3:58:25] zinbers: I look at it as you like whatever you like it your stream where here to just watch plus if other people like it then they can go play that
[3:58:31] TheItalianStallion321: you need patience and must love a story
[3:58:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: A lot of patience, yes
[3:58:33] TheItalianStallion321: i love action
[3:58:35] Buddahphil: Theres a baldurs gate movie?
[3:58:37] PigPenLen: In todays world, you just cannot have an honest personal opinion without it offending or attacking someone else. Stupid.
[3:58:48] Galoari: nah not at all, there's so much shit u should just move on and explore that stuff that attract you :p
[3:58:58] jarilrpg: its not for everyone, i love D&D, and bg3 is definitely the closest you can play D&D in video game form, but i understand its not for everyone
[3:59:00] kamikazis: Well by that philosophy shouldn't they all be Hardcore characters
[3:59:01] Gungre: Who gives two actual fucks about a ruleset in a game? It's a fucking game, play how you fucking wanna play. You wanna reload your save IN A GAME, do it. Do what allows you to have fun in the game
[3:59:08] Zander_TheGamer: @PigPenLen 110% agree dude
[3:59:15] Gungre: @Darwoo
[3:59:42] Darwoo: @Gungre lol okay fair, jsut relax a bit
[3:59:44] FutileDiploma: I like wow idk why but I like wow

[4:00:11] Se7enthSinn: very well said
[4:00:41] zinbers: It like lupo warhammer 40 k streams some people like it other not so much
[4:00:45] TheItalianStallion321: @Fallenstarss b/c people are idiots and sensitive
[4:00:54] TheItalianStallion321: you cant have an opinion anymore
[4:00:59] Galoari: atleast u understand the appeal of bg3, i dont even understand the reason palia exists xD
[4:01:03] Fallenstarss: indeed
[4:01:31] Ramstein: @Galoari this is a weird take. kinda cringe take ngl
[4:01:44] Zander_TheGamer: You can't even say you think it is a good game, but just not for you. Everything has to be black or white, no gray whatsoever. So sad
[4:01:46] TheItalianStallion321: there are snowflakes everywhere. in the real world, in the gaming world.
[4:01:46] Galoari: im trying to, i just dont understand why it needs to be in an mmo setting
[4:02:02] TheItalianStallion321: its like FF14 people. if you say you dont like their game, their community can go ape shit
[4:02:16] TheItalianStallion321: OMG HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE MY GLAMOUR. YOU SUCK YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON

[4:03:32] smashwow: oh it was
[4:03:42] LuiBMHunter: also had AI on characters tho - presume BG3 has that?
[4:03:48] TheItalianStallion321: yeah some people took Towel's twitter post to heart. like you stabbed them in the neck or something
[4:03:51] TheItalianStallion321: it was pretty comical
[4:03:59] Featherbow: I love BG3, bought it as soon as early access dropped. However, I know it's not a game for everyone and that's ok. As long as people aren't outright bashing it, I don't care, which you were not bashing it
[4:04:07] PigPenLen: i dont remember my entire 20s LUL
[4:04:41] zinbers: Bg3 just had divinity 2 vibes to me it a good game but I still figuring out the game so far

[4:51:24] KorbenDallas815: why is that nax crafted gear wanted right now?
[4:51:42] Molvonos: @KorbenDallas815 T3's always been sought after, but the only way to get it was BMAH for almost gold cap.
[4:51:54] reggiepowa: and those who bought it or millions on black market ah
[4:52:01] Molvonos: Since you couldn't ever get it after Naxx got removed from Vanilla for WotLK
[4:52:57] Molvonos: I mean, the people who got it back in the day (or paid out the ass for it in the BMAH) are the only ones who can make it, so they're making bank for their returns.
[4:53:21] Rokaden: What happened to Baldur's Gate 3 @Towelliee ?
[4:53:22] justagamingfiend: i remember buying t3 on black market for 10k
[4:53:44] Rokaden: Not playing anymore?
[4:53:57] Polemn: when is 10.2?
[4:54:10] iloveyalunn: Hows D4 going? heard alot of people were unhappy with the update
[4:54:19] Snabido: The real question is when is 10.4 CoolCat
[4:54:20] TheGiant99: so 10.1.7 soonish
[4:54:32] kamikazis: sooo whats the best part of fried eggs for yall, wife says the yolk is nasty as i sopp up the goodness with my toast
[4:54:40] Rokaden: New update out on Tuesday. Hopefully will help.
[4:54:41] reggiepowa: october seems likely, mr gm is sure 10.1.7 is coming late august
[4:54:50] DunzoCD: its after hallows end i think so itd be nov most likely
[4:55:06] zeiours: HC official next! Can't wait
[4:55:09] Molvonos: @kamikazis Sounds like a good reason for divorce, thinking the yolk is nasty.  towKek
[4:55:15] TheGiant99: the masses of people still playing will enjoy the patch tuesday
[4:55:31] iloveyalunn: yeaaaaa the "community" is getting annoying tbh
[4:55:46] Davedaman26: @Towelliee what is your all time fav game from either PC or console?
[4:56:00] aikopooh: well bitching is part of wow though
[4:56:08] TheGiant99: They will do the same bitching with the new poe league they alwasy do
[4:56:12] N3llee: whats the retention rate of those numbers
[4:56:16] N3llee: Willing to bet in toilet
[4:56:20] Darwoo: 16m copies sold, those numbers are meh
[4:56:22] Rokaden: Very true. Im just hoping it gets better and the negativity stops. Sucks that such an anticipated game is being ridiculed so much. Was so excited for it. Hate all the hate.
[4:56:27] notorietyy: fortunately most of the complainers and ppl that hype stuff have moved on from the game
[4:57:13] Rokaden: The patch that killed it all was horrible. They ruined the game for so many people. Plain and simple.
[4:57:38] TheGiant99: @notorietyy they will bne back tuesday so they have new things to make videos about to complain
[4:57:45] StrawHatLuffy7: lirik said it best on his take about blizzard on livestreamfails
[4:57:53] d2darkalliance: I dont play season, atleast not yet
[4:58:01] Rokaden: CDR and DR Reduction ruined it. The damage reduction was fine.
[4:58:08] PigPenLen: I play as a rogue and am having fun
[4:58:15] manmower: everyone  has 10 characters?
[4:58:34] N3llee: In that seasonal situation all that matters is the retention rate from a $$$ standpoint

[5:02:29] N3llee: @reggiepowa prob should spend 60secs fact checking yourself before talking about things you dont know anything about, clearly
[5:02:53] TheGiant99: @N3llee ill get right on it to satisfy you my friend
[5:02:54] reggiepowa: I'm just curios where did they get the numbers from because Blizzard doesn't publish anything
[5:02:56] Verdell263: LulFR
[5:03:26] Shrenko: just made up random numbers Kappa
[5:03:26] N3llee: @TheGiant99 dont worry about it. wasnt @ you.
[5:03:28] dreamwalker213: hes talking about chat and amount of copies sold
[5:03:36] reggiepowa: character numbers not numbers of sales. like if every player makes 7 characters thats 1 million players total
[5:03:41] N3llee: @reggiepowa yes they do. google it..
[5:03:57] DunzoCD: did those numbers include copied eternal realm characters? Kappa

[5:10:10] gajitron: big nerf/buff comming this tuesday
[5:10:11] gajitron: GOD COMP
[5:10:24] Scarhearth: TGP is boring right now. its only the same 5 classes
[5:10:29] TheGiant99: is wayfinder suppose to be like wildstar
[5:10:37] Fugazi811: no
[5:10:42] BroosDoesRPGs: Not a massive nerf
[5:10:43] 丂卄仨仨仨丂卄: echo omega slacking last night TGP
[5:10:54] Bacon_21: no way the utility is tiers above anything else imo KEKW
[5:10:54] Nerendis: It’s not that big. Bear is still chilling. And God Comp is based on the synergy of their buffs. It’s nbd.
[5:11:16] Calobius: There's a chance Fire gets swapped out for something, but everything else will probably stay the same. Priest got a big nerf but mass dispel is too strong
[5:12:04] TheGiant99: @Towelliee have you tried wayfinder and if so is it like wildstar? IOt kinda looks like it
[5:12:28] Nerendis: Jdotb said he didn’t think there would be a big change.
[5:12:47] marineboi1288: Do you thi k at blizzcon they will announce the next expansion?
[5:12:52] eatclentrenh: aug is still god
[5:12:58] yonima: no lust?
[5:13:00] Diisplaced: @Towelliee from the mage discord and a bunch of the top runners. I have heard that the meta won't change that much. The possible swap is Disc in for Hpal and sitting SP but its all hearsay
[5:13:12] eatclentrenh: aug has lust my boy
[5:14:05] Nerendis: You can’t lose aug, bear, SP. mage is best with SP, and hpal has the most sustain for long fights on high keys. I just don’t see a change without major nerfs or buffs to other classes.
[5:14:35] brookq8kw89: i have bay the mount for 970k from someone got it in the raid XD

[5:15:55] Nerendis: Agreed
[5:16:02] Molvonos: And they cant bring Aug in line with anything, because there isn't any other real support spec.
[5:16:02] Molvonos: lol
[5:16:04] dreamwalker213: it wont change in its current state because its not the "god comp" purely because of tuning...its the synergy and utility
[5:16:07] Nerendis: It’s the synergy of their buffs
[5:16:07] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[5:16:08] Molvonos: So they just do dumb shit
[5:16:18] darkkilla1: its about that burst window every 2 minutes
[5:16:29] eatclentrenh: aug is impossible to balance
[5:16:35] Nerendis: The only thing they can do is just gut aug
[5:16:40] eatclentrenh: either broken at the top or useless
[5:16:44] Bacon_21: I wonder if the tuning was just to get people talking, makes me wonder KEKW
[5:17:09] Nokterian: It sucks because other classes are way under performing
[5:17:12] darkkilla1: they are going to break aug evokers and then we will be like disc priests. where blizz has no clue what to do with them
[5:17:23] dreamwalker213: @eatclentrenh that was my reaction when i saw it announced, either going to be broken and brought into every group or shit and never played
[5:17:33] drakar301: only breaking crap at high level there would never be a *good* time for this crybaby community
[5:17:34] Nerendis: Yeah. The most melee friendly expansion every got rekt by Aug.
[5:17:37] eatclentrenh: yup
[5:17:43] flebbooo: This def makes the theory of them being delayed from launch seem mor believable
[5:17:45] yonima: it was because of the story thats only why
[5:18:42] wraaith: we gettign 10.2 news at bcon or u think we get it sooner and expan at bcon ?
[5:18:49] Qoax: I’m happy Evoker came out durning mid season patch, I would have been ass if it came out broken during the world first raid content with patch 10.2
[5:19:29] Nokterian: Blizzcon new expansion for sure
[5:19:35] ShowDUH: or 10.3
[5:20:01] yonima: just waiting for rogue rework info atm
[5:20:25] Nerendis: 10.2 announcement is a week or two from this Tuesday.
[5:20:31] Nokterian: 10.2.5 the extra bit or best hits
[5:20:32] manmower: pretty clear watch 11.0 is already
[5:20:45] ShowDUH: Void shit somewhere
[5:20:52] DunzoCD: into the void
[5:21:13] Ziddrax: the dark void :D
[5:21:16] ShrenTheOrc: with new races hopefully

[5:21:35] wraaith: has trhe leek guy done the leek yet for 11.0 ?
[5:21:37] manmower: 10.2 probably biggest patch yet
[5:21:38] d2darkalliance: we wont get into the void @Towelliee for this expansion. we going to another place on azeroth.
[5:21:41] ArcaneMaki: Anduinn making a comeback in 11.0 as a grown man.
[5:21:52] mizerboy: @Towelliee  - do you think a new expansion will be announced at BlizzCon?
[5:21:59] Nokterian: Anduin will have a beard
[5:22:04] manmower: 11.0 is gonna be about void and elves
[5:22:12] Nerendis: I’d kind of dig on a new class in 11.0. I know it would be back to back. But I’m just feeling it.
[5:22:38] N3llee: think this blizz will be focused on that new survial game of theirs
[5:22:39] ShowDUH: new class was every 2 at least yah
[5:22:42] Molvonos: Survival: Melee Support Spec.
[5:22:45] manmower: maybe a new healing spec for DH added
[5:22:48] Scarhearth: classes seem to be every 2 xpacs
[5:22:52] Contendedlemon: tuskar race for sure, uses the same skeleton as pandaren
[5:22:54] DunzoCD: 3rd DH spec maybe?
[5:22:57] Nerendis: Yeah but they skipped their cadence of class release with BFA and SL
[5:23:09] kamikazis: im betting on more support specs
[5:23:09] manmower: 5th  druid spec maybe
[5:23:11] Bacon_21: I sort of miss ranged survival KEKW
[5:23:25] WSquiggle12: I don’t know about a new class but I wouldn’t be surprised to see a new spec announced
[5:23:35] ShowDUH: DK WotLK, (Cata Skip), Monk MoP, (WoD Skip), DH Legion, (BFA/SL Skip), Evoker DF
[5:23:41] Nokterian: We will see another disc priest rework in 10.2
[5:23:49] darkkilla1: survival gonna be the first mail based tank
[5:23:51] kamikazis: how cool would beast master tank spec be?
[5:23:51] ShowDUH: yeah only thing i could see happen is maybe new races
[5:23:54] ShrenTheOrc: im predicting with the new world tree we will get new type of elves
[5:23:56] manmower: survival will become tank
[5:23:57] ShowDUH: or Allied Races
[5:24:01] Nerendis: New class was every 2 expac until BFA/SL. So they are off their cadence.
[5:24:05] Bacon_21: survival = bombs duh Kappa
[5:24:10] manmower: you ride around on your pet while you tank

[5:24:33] Thoreya: shit was fun af
[5:24:34] ThePawPaw: nah BM should be a TANK
[5:24:35] manmower: survival needs to completely toss out the dumb bomb stuff
[5:24:38] Affiiance: Just make it support spec Kappa
[5:24:44] kamikazis: i woulda tanked as a hunter
[5:24:54] Omnavor: please give me survival tank
[5:25:07] ShowDUH: nobody want survival tank
[5:25:13] ArcaneMaki: Survival tank would be great
[5:25:17] Bacon_21: @Affiiance have a player as a "pet" give them a buff Kappa

[5:27:29] Nerendis: They have to make another support spec or they will never be able to balance aug properly @towelliee
[5:27:34] Nokterian: Demonology back as tank spec it worked in wotlk Kappa
[5:27:46] at1c: Time Mage
[5:28:12] darkrowse21: do u think wow will ever have a 4th spec for all classes as a option
[5:28:21] WSquiggle12: Chrono mage would be a cool support spec
[5:28:25] manmower: don't want support so strong that you want one of them in every group

[5:28:30] neverbornlucky: I would tank if a hunter could be a tank
[5:28:32] Nerendis: I like my Aug. but it was a fucking MISTAKE
[5:28:38] DunzoCD: @Nokterian still remember demo tanking in SSC, was peak warlock times
[5:28:43] captain_khyzan: time mage would just be aug...
[5:28:45] Bacon_21: @darkrowse21 they can barely handle 3 imo KEKW
[5:28:47] Templexx: did they try something with a warr spec to do something different?
[5:28:55] ShowDUH: Glad Stance !
[5:28:59] N3llee: having any kind of alternate spec system would 10 fold make balancing harder.
[5:29:02] WonkaWash: fireside chat
[5:29:05] darkkilla1: to be fair everyone knew a support class was going to be a misteak
[5:29:10] Calobius: I think Beastmaster could be a fun support spec. Using a variety of beasts to assists you and your allies
[5:29:31] manmower: tune down their dmg buffs and improve their healing/survivability buffs
[5:29:45] eatclentrenh: i wish they would buff dev its alot more fun to play
[5:29:48] darkrowse21: at least we aint complex like eq2 which has 5 talent trees
[5:29:52] neverbornlucky: Towellie I got beat up by a 1 and a half year old. She pushed me to her play room not letting me go sit down
[5:30:25] Nerendis: It will never be balanced for top toer
[5:30:48] drakar301: love levels always mimic the top 1%
[5:30:49] TheItalianStallion321: im gonna start asking for metas for +3 keys
[5:30:53] drakar301: low
[5:30:56] drakar301: no different
[5:31:14] djaevel03: @calobius tame a butterfly for increased heals
[5:31:22] Nerendis: Couldn’t get into a 16 on my 442 boomie yesterday because not Aug. what the actual fuck???
[5:31:35] eddie_masa: @Towelliee so true
[5:31:36] Kiddeath77: do it
[5:32:00] rhodistar: Buff 1, buff 2, buff 3
[5:32:00] manmower: fly, breath, scales
[5:32:09] eatclentrenh: people want to parse
[5:32:12] Bacon_21: KEKW
[5:32:26] darkkilla1: whats funny.. i play a aug evoker and all but augs are only as good as the party. you can have  aug all day if your other 2 dps dont know what they are doing your better off taking a normal dps
[5:32:35] darkrowse21: i know in eq2 support roles dont focus on damage and are advanced roles in game focusin on debuff n buff n cc and have like 6 action bars of abils
[5:32:36] Nerendis: Parsing in a 16 kekW @eatclentrenh

[5:32:50] eatclentrenh: yup lmao
[5:32:55] drakar301: its the only players p[laying really well that also helps
[5:32:57] manmower: parse in dungeons? only thing that matters is how large the tank can pull
[5:33:02] drakar301: other***
[5:33:14] flebbooo: By the end of DF, Ebon might will buff your dmg by 2% KEKW
[5:33:29] N3llee: havent played wow in months but its funny to me just a few weeks ago evokers were complaining they couldnt find a group
[5:33:40] eddie_masa: KEKW
[5:33:54] Infoxy: True KEKW
[5:33:58] Daganatv: yeah, we call those ppl morons lmao
[5:34:04] eatclentrenh: @N3llee well dev is garbo
[5:34:17] blazyturtle: idk playing ret i feel like i notice my dps is better with an aug in the group
[5:34:26] BroosDoesRPGs: 4th portal letsgoooo
[5:34:31] Nerendis: Not being able to read is a common affliction amongst WoW players.
[5:35:02] eatclentrenh: meanwhile there is an aug in this group lol

[5:35:16] darkrowse21: would tell playas  dont     understand go play eq2 and play support role so they fully understand what their job in game is in dungeons and raids
[5:35:26] BroosDoesRPGs: I main ret.. 2 of our biggest aoe abilities that we also use in st so it's pretty big
[5:35:34] Molvonos: i
[5:35:41] Molvonos: Hi, I'm the Aug.
[5:35:42] swervity82: yes
[5:35:46] luckfore: #removeaugmentation
[5:35:47] BroosDoesRPGs: Divine storm, ashes, consecrate
[5:35:50] Molvonos: Im also 443 with leggo
[5:36:01] theDirtyon3: shhhh
[5:36:12] N3llee: @eatclentrenh nah thats where you are wrong. the players are garbo
[5:36:12] Infoxy: yeah its nice
[5:36:19] eatclentrenh: wish i had the leggo
[5:36:23] Nerendis: That’s been a bug since 10.1
[5:36:35] manmower: you have to cast it so often, it would be bad if it shared CD
[5:36:36] Moobot: Happy to announce we are now sponsored towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee | Currently using the K100 RGB Optical Keybord/Scimitar RGB Elite MMO Mouse/HS80 RBG Wireless Headset/MM700 3XL RGB MAT!
[5:36:43] eatclentrenh: @N3llee dev can work but its legitimately near the bottom
[5:38:54] luckfore: im gonna get your dick wut
[5:39:04] Ketchin_Games: yes 8%
[5:39:34] BroosDoesRPGs: I pump with aug as it is
[5:39:39] Nerendis: Aug is significantly better with ranged classes than melee.
[5:39:48] PidiaP: Disc buffs Pog
[5:39:50] Nerendis: But there could be a melee buffed to the point it doesn't matter
[5:40:07] SLLiN: enhance pumps with aug
[5:40:20] TheItalianStallion321: but wasnt AUG like making UH DKs look like Thanos?
[5:40:25] Nerendis: Mage double PI would be digusting
[5:40:53] Nerendis: @TheItalianStallion321 On some fights with PI. The issue with UH DKs is their cycles don't line up with PI
[5:40:53] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[5:41:13] Nerendis: That's again the point of God Comp. PI and Aug line up with SP and Mage cycles. Melee cycles don't line up with PI as well.
[5:41:31] TheItalianStallion321: @Nerendis no AUG. there was a raid with 2 UH DKs and like 20 aug evokers and they did 3.5 million dps
[5:41:31] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[5:41:34] TheItalianStallion321: there was no PI
[5:41:34] Nerendis: It's not necessarily that mage + SP are the best classes. But they ARE the best classes with Aug
[5:41:35] Ketchin_Games: Heavy nerfs to Fire though, and nerf to Frost just in case haha
[5:41:41] darkkilla1: i dont think there is a class that doesnt "work" with aug. it part of the reason unless they break aug there is no way aug will never not be S tier
[5:42:07] TheItalianStallion321: @darkkilla1 there are specs that work better with aug though
[5:42:25] TheItalianStallion321: but in general, yes aug makes everything better. like butter
[5:42:27] Nerendis: @darkkilla1 That's what I just said lol
[5:42:28] darkkilla1: thats why i put "work" in question morks
[5:42:31] TheItalianStallion321: butter makes all food better
[5:42:35] darkkilla1: marks*
[5:42:54] gl3nnz0r: bm issnt that good with aug, cant buff pets yet
[5:43:36] nephttv_: @gl3nnz0r yes it can
[5:43:49] darkkilla1: dont BM hunter pets scale off hunter stats
[5:44:14] nephttv_: they do
[5:44:17] nephttv_: yall are tripping
[5:44:18] Nerendis: The point of God Comp is all 5 classes work with each other the BEST. Not that they are the best spec so to speak.
[5:44:32] gl3nnz0r: was told it wassnt that great
[5:44:45] gl3nnz0r: why use bm, when you can go fire and priest ^^
[5:45:01] PidiaP: Shadow got nerfed to the ground
[5:45:10] darkkilla1: it does not seem that great because WCL is still bugged when it comes to tracking the buff on pets
[5:45:17] nephttv_: There's also so much more to the god comp besides damage
[5:45:22] Nerendis: That's just shadow though. It's either S+ tier or shitter tier
[5:45:30] AshhTV: when does 10.2 come out since youre doing prep?
[5:45:30] Moobot: New D4 Twitch Prime Loot- Brackish Fetch Mount Armor Bundle https://shorturl.at/agACX
[5:45:30] Molvonos: Augvoker's good with any DPS, to be fair.  It's why they keep nerfing Fate Mirror.
[5:45:33] manmower: we called it before xpac, once we let the dragonpeople in it was all downhill
[5:45:35] TheItalianStallion321: its defensives, utility
[5:45:37] TheItalianStallion321: healing
[5:45:42] Molvonos: The ability to give 15 (now 10) percent additional damage.
[5:45:44] Molvonos: To anyone
[5:45:48] Nerendis: @nephttv_ That's my point.
[5:45:57] nephttv_: Priest has vamp. Mage gives mass barrier. Aug gives a massive absorb. 2 of the 3 dps specs have a cheat death
[5:46:27] PidiaP: Part of the shadow problem is that Mass Dispel is too good borderline require on certain keys at certain levels
[5:46:44] Nerendis: Cheat Death is probably the most undervalued ability to casual players.
[5:46:46] nephttv_: that too, mass dispel is insane
[5:46:48] JLM23: Think vamp was either 10 or 15%
[5:46:50] PidiaP: Shadow only gets replaced if the healing priests are more competitive
[5:46:54] dirtydeus: Slap on the wrist
[5:47:13] manmower: it's popular
[5:47:17] 3663Sharad: they keep increasing it until peebs cancel their subs
[5:47:19] TheItalianStallion321: dude gas prices rose like 25 fuckin cents here in NY over the past 2 weeks
[5:47:23] LittleHomie55: but will you cancel?
[5:47:40] darkrowse21: peacock
[5:47:41] WoWRoach: Man Youtube tv started at 35, now I pay like 80 with 4k.  But glad NFL is coming
[5:47:47] DrkPhoenix6913: a lot of them arent worth the price their asking now... it's getting outta hand and more expensive than cable :P
[5:47:58] gzus81: peacock went premium even if you have cable sub
[5:48:01] Nerendis: I actually did go back to torrenting
[5:48:26] drakar301: Time to start stringing up billionaires
[5:48:30] drakar301: they swing just  like the rest of us

[5:50:23] blazyturtle: goggles is funtiopn over form i think
[5:50:26] DrkPhoenix6913: so who won that?
[5:50:32] AquaJamz: thought Nate would do better than that tbh
[5:50:34] eatclentrenh: who won
[5:50:57] LotusBomb: come on its all scripted behind closed doors
[5:51:00] LotusBomb: paid under the table
[5:51:06] abracka_: think diaz got paid $10 mil for that lol
[5:51:06] LotusBomb: to throw
[5:51:09] TheGiant99: yea Paul won

[5:51:45] LotusBomb: he dont fking care
[5:51:54] manmower: isn't the point for them to lose?
[5:51:56] ShowDUH: All these fighter don't give a shit it's a boxing match against MMA players lol
[5:52:04] LotusBomb: its all a show, circus
[5:52:06] Nerendis: The issue with paying is Netflix (and others) have a trick. They sign a writer contract for 900k for 3 seasons. But it starts at 100k for season 1 and scales up. They then cancel after season 1 for a basically free 1 season show.
[5:52:11] Iver_monk: He wanted conor forst
[5:52:19] TheItalianStallion321: these fights are like fake, fake reality shows
[5:52:39] AquaJamz: you'd be surpised, McGregor is beef af now
[5:52:40] TickleMyAfro: Racket lol
[5:52:49] ShowDUH: I'd love to see Jake in a UFC ring against those MMA fighter
[5:52:50] anOceaninadrop: @nerendis that sounds disgusting
[5:52:52] darkrowse21: logan won his summerslam match last night
[5:53:01] TheItalianStallion321: Tyson still a beast. he will be until he dies
[5:53:06] abracka_: we don't need to see a kid get murdered KEKW
[5:53:09] manmower: this is like having basketball players compete in soccer
[5:53:31] AquaJamz: more like footballers going to rugby
[5:53:33] Nerendis: @ErebusAeternus Exceptionally
[5:53:50] manmower: why don't they just do MMA?
[5:53:56] abracka_: LOL
[5:53:57] AquaJamz: funny how Jake fought 1 actual boxer and lost
[5:53:57] DunzoCD: he lost when he fought the boxer
[5:54:00] abracka_: that's a dumb fuckin move
[5:54:17] theDirtyon3: Mans would destroy him
[5:54:26] ShowDUH: @manmower cause it's just a show for money, everyone knows Jake wouldn't hold a candle to MMA player in a UFC ring

[5:58:17] manmower: you would need to do actual weight classes right?
[5:58:17] misterwinoe: as if boxing records mean anything?
[5:58:23] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee I wanted to be a monk. But I never got the chants.

[5:58:33] Burkie206: Jake Paul hasn't been doing it for very long. But hopefully he starts to box some actual boxers. One problem is not many of them are big draws

[6:31:11] skylaars: if its comfortable i dont consider it starving
[6:31:23] Fibnkak: Glutide
[6:31:49] drakar301: nah general public thinks its something amazing, i got nothing against it. just want people to know what it is actually doing
