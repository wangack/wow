[0:38:39] Daydash_Gaming: yeah I’ve noticed crazy burst dps in these games where you get 1 minute pops
[0:39:00] whompastyle: It was cool seeing a mistweaver make some noise.
[0:39:04] imitatewater: rsham mana is illegal its insane how tuna went through 4 mana bars while absterge used 1
[0:40:01] eainzsp: i think thats a fair design decision
[0:40:08] whompastyle: Mistweaver was Zhang on Le Pomp
[0:40:11] imitatewater: @cdewx do you think they should nerf the stealth drinking and give them more mana reg?
[0:40:17] GoldenA_: you been getting ganked a lot byhigh lvls? lol

[0:49:08] whompastyle: Who was the 4th of Prevs team?
[0:49:10] imitatewater: @revid21 problem is lontar is a dampener he doesnt have that killer instinct that fits more the echo playstyle

[0:51:57] buffevoker: Ur team
[0:52:14] Riddrik: i feel like i havent seen a lot of the usual big names in eu's awc, did a lot of players move on from the game?
[0:52:28] nameyourform: idk why people hating on Lontar. he’s a great healer too
[0:52:40] Kleenextv: i do think mehh is better than lontar, just an opinion obv
