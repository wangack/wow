[0:25:15] outofcontrolwtf: Reduce the 3 hour long games to 5 min
[0:25:22] ravvqt: classic was always pure bullshit in my eyes but SoD is pure Bullshit with even more bullshit
[0:25:40] DveevD: Finns det ngn toy för sklettet?
[0:25:42] ravvqt: like how are people playing lvl 40 blue bots with 2 new abilitys xD
[0:25:46] Dokkotter: Swefrench
[0:26:10] saubur: lmao remember in tbc when chan meleed a druid for 5h to break his armor in 1v1
[0:26:26] flemminggXD: i only arena log on wotlk, sod keeps me busy otherwise atm
[0:26:31] ravvqt: you would rather play 47mins then dampenig
[0:26:32] sakuya_tk: every expansion where is no arena is totaly garbage imagine bg ques 24hours xD
[0:26:35] Preghierax: halo
[0:26:38] ravvqt: sounds like u make money out of gaming XD
[0:27:02] flowywow: lmao 5 hour melee is just psychotic
[0:27:38] ravvqt: yeah you are very true tbh
[0:27:47] Srenix: Is there Dampening in Cata?
[0:27:47] rayzerpls: I think lvl 60 content in SoD willbe really good
[0:27:51] rayzerpls: anything before that isnt fun
[0:27:51] saubur: psychotic sums up chan tbf
[0:27:53] rayzerpls: for me
[0:27:53] ravvqt: i remember s6 dk/hpal vs lock/sham.. it was always 47min
[0:28:02] ravvqt: i cursed with everything i had
[0:28:02] saubur: i think dampening came in late mop i think
[0:28:12] saubur: s14
[0:28:21] Lawzvnr: looking forward for sod arenas
[0:28:24] Jumpka: and once you put in dampening, people start playing different since it's a win condition

[0:29:34] kenniflopper: Dampening is a good and bad, cause classes like feral / rogue can draw out the game long enough into dampening and just 1shot someone
[0:29:45] kenniflopper: its just bad design
[0:29:50] juise_mad: 👋👾🔥
[0:30:01] ravvqt: 57-6
[0:30:03] ravvqt: holy fuq
[0:30:09] ravvqt: calm down pls
[0:30:11] Lawzvnr: dampening implies the game has flaws
[0:30:35] rayzerpls: dampening in mop rarely hits in 3s
[0:30:37] rayzerpls: in 2s yea
[0:30:39] flowywow: can’t wait for 2x blood dks to gatekeep the casual gamers at 1800 nezt season
[0:30:39] rayzerpls: it hits most games

[2:35:18] everytimeirelia: @Mirlol when stream?
[2:35:22] Mirlol: @jamminlove good
[2:35:42] Mirlol: having to queue last hour of the season for 0 reason and coinflip ur r1 title is kinda stupid
[2:35:43] drigo26: @mirlol come back man
[2:36:02] Mirlol: i am back just havent felt like streaming
[2:36:05] Mirlol: it just feels like
[2:36:08] Mirlol: wrath is insanely dead
[2:36:08] reikowins: wait season ends today?
[2:36:13] Zero_Kelvin: Inflation sucks. You can't queue last day or two for whatever reason, whole season is fucked
[2:36:29] jamminlove: I agree
[2:36:36] jamminlove: but activity gets affected due to psychology
[2:37:16] jamminlove: Inflation was like democracy, not a great system but the best alternative compared to the rest
[2:37:38] jamminlove: I meant capitalism, I typed democracy
[2:37:39] drigo26: Wait season ends today? X2
[2:37:40] raselsuggy: Chatting
[2:37:42] jamminlove: we have an issue
[2:37:46] Mirlol: Chatting
[2:37:47] Zero_Kelvin: inflation maybe helps lower rated players eventually get their gear
[2:38:03] Worldzbtw: good thing about inflation is that there is more activity right?
[2:38:04] jamminlove: @Zero_Kelvin It also makes so top people dont sit afk
[2:38:12] Urpalmax: why dont you just add mmr inflation back, you make all the changes right? put up a PR and ill approve it @jamminlove
[2:38:22] Worldzbtw: but ure like forcing ppl to queue when they shouldnt (?)

[2:40:06] Mirlol: top players should be able to afk camp rank 1
[2:40:08] Zero_Kelvin: if the cutoffs are going up anyway, even if less so, people still can't afk right? So it's fine for now
[2:40:11] Mirlol: at least with a few days left of the season
[2:40:16] ktp_blue: Wow you can hear pojke turned up his fake keyboard sounds to cover his ahk
[2:40:22] Mirlol: top players shouldnt have to gamble rank 1 last day
[2:40:26] Mirlol: coz of mmr inflation
[2:40:26] jamminlove: What I proposed early on
[2:40:35] jamminlove: was inflation until 1 month before season end
[2:40:37] jamminlove: or 3 weeks I forget
[2:40:44] Mirlol: i almost lost 3x rank 1 last season coz i faced 10 dk's in a row last 2 hours of the season
[2:40:48] Mirlol: and i was top 10 all of s7
[2:40:52] Mirlol: seems fair
[2:41:00] jamminlove: I mean yea but you're a terrible player
[2:41:02] Urpalmax: top player will make it against any odds

[2:41:16] ktp_blue: Damn toxic chat
[2:41:22] Urpalmax: i dont see qwneer complaining about comps.....
[2:41:30] Turaxyy: Hi jammin :)
[2:41:30] Srenix: So what are the results Jammin
[2:41:37] L0WIIE: F the dogs OhMyDog
[2:41:38] jamminlove: 5-1 @Srenix
[2:41:39] Turaxyy: Morning*
[2:41:41] Srenix: Inflation?
[2:41:45] Mirlol: inflation until last 2 weeks
[2:41:46] Mirlol: is good
[2:41:51] jamminlove: ^
[2:41:54] jamminlove: wishlist
[2:41:56] Srenix: 5-1 what
[2:42:03] yexthereal: rogbog
[2:42:10] Srenix: Rogbog <3
[2:42:11] shozgodx: ez
[2:42:14] ktp_blue: EZ
[2:42:18] demongodxtv: howwwwwwww
[2:42:20] KDK_here: -14 D:
[2:42:23] Zero_Kelvin: I'm a bit confused. Is inflation that big, that just in last 2 weeks it matters this much?
[2:42:29] Dokkotter: they gave like no points
[2:42:38] Mirlol: who has the advantage dpf or wp @Minpojke
[2:42:41] Dokkotter: or did u drop hm
[2:42:47] Srenix: @jamminlove everything stays the same now y?
[2:42:47] jamminlove: @Zero_Kelvin With the amount of activity end of season, the accumulated inflation impacts it a lot
[2:42:51] Urpalmax: they are low noobs @Dokkotter
[2:42:53] jamminlove: @Minpojke inflation doesnt exist right now
[2:42:54] reikowins: how long left in the season?
[2:42:54] paradisossp: What better play s8 with priest disc or shadow?
[2:42:55] jamminlove: like at all
[2:43:00] raselsuggy: without countergear dpf has the advantage
[2:43:06] raselsuggy: with countergear warpal wins
[2:43:20] Mirlol: what does wp countergear look like into dpf
[2:43:32] Zero_Kelvin: Does your mmr inflate when you're not playing? I.e. I log out for a month and come back, will my mmr be higher
[2:43:38] Urpalmax: pve haste on pala
[2:43:42] Urpalmax: right?
[2:43:44] Mirlol: plate + extra resil on war and more mp5 on pala?
[2:43:46] shozgodx: i countergear my underwear for my work day. r1 play trust
[2:43:47] jamminlove: @Zero_Kelvin it used to be like this yes
[2:43:49] raselsuggy: can play 1245 resil on warr
[2:43:52] jamminlove: every day mmr would increase
[2:43:56] raselsuggy: 3x pvp pieces
[2:43:58] jamminlove: they changed it mid season cuz of retail
[2:44:08] jamminlove: And now there's no inflation and people are flooding my inbox
[2:44:08] fingerboy___: @Mirlol heard something about preg hunt + some disc rogue the other game vs mwako/melo
[2:44:10] Zero_Kelvin: ah so if many people log in after being afk for a long time, suddenly they have giga mmr to spend
[2:44:14] reikowins: how long left in the season?
[2:44:19] jamminlove: @Zero_Kelvin pmuch
[2:44:21] fingerboy___: other day* xD
[2:44:25] jamminlove: nop
[2:44:28] Srenix: So they removed it this season?
[2:44:31] jamminlove: Mid season
[2:44:32] jamminlove: yea
[2:44:34] Mirlol: @fingerboy___ wdym?
[2:44:37] Zero_Kelvin: I think it's a good change
[2:44:43] Srenix: I like it
[2:44:52] Srenix: Less inflation = More activity
[2:44:57] raselsuggy: ye but if u have more resil u can go more priest
[2:44:57] fingerboy___: @Mirlol heard u got countered spec
[2:44:59] jamminlove: its the opposite srenix
[2:44:59] raselsuggy: and u can bbc him
[2:45:02] jamminlove: lmao
[2:45:09] jamminlove: The only good thing about inflation is activity
[2:45:17] jamminlove: You lose a buttload of activity if you remove inflation
[2:45:22] reikowins: how long left in the season?
[2:45:23] Turaxyy: Srenix is the 1st that doesnt q if hé cant get rating
[2:45:30] raselsuggy: 850 resil KEKW
[2:45:36] Srenix: @Turaxyy NOT TRUE
[2:45:45] ktp_blue: Best thing about inflation is twitch stream titles that feature "4k mmr Pog"
[2:45:47] Turaxyy: I mean
[2:45:52] Eonx: @jamminlove think inflation will come back before season end or not really worth now?
[2:45:57] jamminlove: idk
[2:46:05] Srenix: I am like the only guy who ques into everything wdym, I'm like the opposite of what you described

[2:46:08] Eonx: i know people on retail are begging for it since glad is basically r1
[2:46:17] raselsuggy: @Srenix hahahaha
[2:46:22] Turaxyy: No you talk a lot about mmr / cr
[2:46:27] Turaxyy: Constantly
[2:46:29] jamminlove: @raselsuggy he laughed at you @Srenix
[2:46:38] xarlivenow: he laughed at you @Srenix
[2:46:39] Srenix: For like 3 days KEKW
[2:46:46] nerdstomperxz: @jamminlove are u a blizzard employee or just randomly selected as the guy they dm? never understood
[2:46:51] Turaxyy: Its not a flame
[2:47:01] jamminlove: @nerdstomperxz Im a nobody
[2:47:09] ktp_blue: Poor jammin
[2:47:10] Srenix: But it's not true
[2:47:19] Turaxyy: -_-
[2:47:23] Zero_Kelvin: Aren't people that care about inflation top pvpers? If so... do they really want to sit afk instead of playing? Unless they just gatekeep the ladder with alts. It also makes boosting more tempting.
[2:47:24] Srenix: I care for top 10 for the meme, for 3 days
[2:47:28] raselsuggy: jammin is also a cata player (with 10 games played on cata)
[2:48:06] Srenix: And suddenly I am the first one to not que :D Even though I que vs everything
[2:48:14] Srenix: Haven't dodged a game yet
[2:48:17] jamminlove: @Srenix Ur now known
[2:48:18] Azmoddan: @Zero_Kelvin inflation is a win win for everyone, top end pvpers can break records and there is more traction in r1 range so ppl dont sit, and lowbies can get their items/achievements easier
[2:48:21] jamminlove: as dodger srenix
[2:48:24] Turaxyy: @zero_kelvin its very unhealthy this last day inflation
[2:48:43] scardrextv: Why doesnt he just charge the priest?
[2:48:53] raselsuggy: thats why u put on more resil
[2:48:56] icntblvit: this guy shinta plays wotlk for 15 years and everytime he's so surprised from the dmg :D
[2:49:02] gekkuxz: @raselsuggy when r u going bedge

[2:49:29] raselsuggy: @gekkuxz hahahaha
[2:49:38] raselsuggy: at 00 +
[2:49:48] Zero_Kelvin: Overall removing inflation makes sense before season ends. Also if you haven't played for 2 months and you log in last day, you should not get any extra mmr
[2:49:48] Srenix: I even streamed my games quing into feral/Rogue
[2:49:52] Srenix: I donnu Tura

[2:52:20] fingerboy___: @Ripleyxz is it true that you almost won vs Qwneer the other day in 2s or is Dverik just meming as always pog?
[2:52:22] jamminlove: @Azmoddan I mean no, he's only proposing inflating the mmr of people actively playing, this means that people who don't actively play won't ever catch up
[2:52:28] jamminlove: This was proven in s11 )
[2:52:30] Turaxyy: Im just saying if there were inflation constantly he would q more
[2:52:47] Turaxyy: And I don't think im wrong

[4:36:23] kenniflopper: They have to remove r1 titles from 2s atleast
[4:36:25] shivxxx: @scardrextv they probably won't. In WOTLK you also only could get shoulders from 3s, they changed that as well this time
[4:36:29] kronyxius: i have like 20k 2s games and <500 3s games on my account... 2s always been better imo
[4:36:30] shivxxx: they probably keep making things easier

[4:36:33] kenniflopper: 2s is sooo bad
[4:36:50] Scryna: @kenniflopper 2s in cata is even worse
[4:37:03] kenniflopper: yea 2s in cata is the epidemy of bad game design
[4:37:15] scardrextv: Didnt they historically get rid of titles from 2s in cata?
[4:37:22] kenniflopper: @scardrextv it was removed in s7 wrath
[4:37:31] Scryna: @scardrextv it happened in og wrath already
[4:37:35] kenniflopper: but wrath classic still has it
[4:37:38] shivxxx: i actually remember cata 2s being alot more fun than wotlk 2s
[4:37:41] demongodxtv: cata 2s last season wasnt bad @Minpojke

[4:45:20] Zero_Kelvin: I think the most likely scenario is classic ends with cata and they... do it all over again from scratch
[4:45:40] cepsegnever: @Zero_Kelvin no lol, mop is comin 100%
[4:45:50] Zero_Kelvin: why, which PvE player wants MoP
[4:45:51] ItsNoyzTv: Would be sad if they stop after Cata
[4:45:51] demongodxtv: they wont end it at cata mop was too popular
[4:45:58] ItsNoyzTv: @Zero_Kelvin +
[4:46:20] Zero_Kelvin: you guys are hard coping that an expansion's PvP popularity has ANY bearing on decisions
[4:46:31] cepsegnever: its free money for them
[4:46:50] cepsegnever: cata mop was known to be released years ago before even 2019 classic, all these 5 were gonna come out
[4:46:52] cepsegnever: no clue after tho
[4:47:33] Zero_Kelvin: I mean sure you might have 1 mop server in europe and have it active, and maybe it's free money but... not much money :)
[4:48:39] cepsegnever: they should focus on this classic rute + making retail good again, remove dogshit new models etc, instead of giving SoD and other garbage that nobody asked for and ruin the other 2 main games these days
[4:48:47] cepsegnever: but that's asking for too much for activision i guess

[6:18:17] daltine: ye i agree
[6:18:20] xeenmannen: Boosted a priest.  do u have any keybinds guide on disc?

[6:18:37] Hangatyyr: Yeah, kinda pricey but if its abit cooler during the summer i dont mind it. The fakeleather etc just gets sticky
[6:18:42] jaunra: Didnt DK have dispell on dot ticks in first seasons of Cata? And insane corpse explotion damamge? Basicly only shammy that could do anything against it in the start
[6:18:46] Real_Yanto: thanks bro
