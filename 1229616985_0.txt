[1:57:29] 2twofaced: odslowNoz
[1:57:32] pooomper: @ProdigySo the point of tgp is to push the highest possible keys. its over a few days and they get score based on the key levels they time for each dungeon

[1:58:24] Nyduss04: legion dungeons are allowed?
[1:58:31] Lorrdzik: @ProdigySo Teams have set time how long they can   push keys. Who push the highest wins. You sum up all keys level from all dungeons they do. Don't know how you deal when more teams have same key level done. I would guess % time less on these keys.
[1:58:31] Trademarked: :)
[1:58:32] Shearin77: @JonasBrotherGaming tomorrow they will add 1 more and sunday another
[1:58:41] PatrickJesp: Played the game since vanilla. So came to see if things changed. Guess not

[2:00:45] Rogastik: @JonasBrotherGaming its always 1 chest, 2 chest means they were fast enough to upgrade the key 2 levels instead of 1, back in legion you used to get extra chests I think
[2:00:48] Retfosho: ResidentSleeper
[2:00:49] kallenxtv: @JonasBrotherGaming no it means they get a key lvl thats 2 higher. you only get 1 chest no matter what

[2:46:39] Onyo1337: @Xyronic do you think we will see WL ?
[2:46:51] Markusxo: it's sad that all these teams have all of the same classes/comp with maybe 1 variance
[2:46:56] skilled_fragi: @kiwiicake legion was best expansion ever
[2:47:01] Sparowfski: @Arisolo well they are most likely but they couldve probably written a contract for "all WoW Events" instead of MDI and AWC
[2:47:05] christurk: they should do a holy priest mage tower contest

[5:17:21] VivaZebra: Twitch chat is always right: RDruid on top 9.2
[5:17:26] BUR1X: how did bonedust get into a 30?
[5:17:27] Lorrdzik: @MakzzTV wonder that too KEKW
[5:17:47] Alasacy: it was wrong affixes aswell
[5:17:49] rest87: Echo also started once with wring affixes
[5:17:51] lougro4: naowh4
[5:18:10] Kiko5297: !bracket
[5:18:17] SwaggWaggon: weird theyd do spires when their Eye is so low
[5:18:41] Lorrdzik: because SoA is longer
[5:18:51] Lorrdzik: so they save time
[5:19:00] VivaZebra: @Vegasbombz they incorporated the legion timewalking, pretty dope if you ask me
[5:19:03] SwaggWaggon: yeah but they might not make it next day for trhat time save to matter LOL
[5:19:07] doraemon_26: does a team get eliminated today ?
[5:19:16] SwaggWaggon: yes
[5:19:19] ttiewinwt: @doraemon_26 yes
[5:19:20] worthtv: y
[5:19:21] stryk66: @vegasbombz no they dont have to, but they can do that and people actually enjoy it
[5:19:21] Shearin77: @doraemon_26 yes
[5:19:28] sLr_____: @vegasbombz why is reusing content a bad thing?
[5:19:30] oldmatejayse: legion weapons work in timewalking?
[5:19:35] Ignite_CLO: this was by high demand and people welcomed legion dungeons with open arms but good job being a negative nancy :) @Vegasbombz
[5:19:59] Esotraz: warlock mage player
[5:20:00] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[5:20:00] Lorrdzik: @Vegasbombz I think that is great and O hope to see more of that in future. To use MoP, WoD dunges too. They should stop with waistingh content they made in the game
[5:20:09] matching_towels: SMOrc give me attention
[5:20:10] VivaZebra: they have 15 years of content, I'm glad they're getting new uses out of it
[5:20:24] Shearin77: feign death saved my life many many times
[5:20:33] BUR1X: why did that guy just got bnned?, seemed like normal critisism
[5:20:49] stryk66: not really
[5:20:54] Warblade23: mumbo jumbo should do a 28 HOA
[5:20:58] SwaggWaggon: 28 over the 25 is interesting
[5:21:08] SwaggWaggon: 24*
[5:21:32] Sumirina: They might not be that confident in their soa
[5:21:44] NWTFIsJuice: highest key is better
[5:21:45] Sumirina: and take a look during downtime till tomorrow
[5:21:50] matching_towels: 11min left
[5:21:53] Dwealing: @SwaggWaggon Probably for the tiebreaker
[5:22:02] Warblade23: 28 HOA is the best PLAY
[5:22:14] pls_dad_no_ddos: @BUR1X bro i saw someone get banned for saying "freemasonry" earlier i dont even know how that was offensive but i guess blizzard doesn't like it
[5:22:15] Lorrdzik: Echo is in safe spot, that is why they went with SoA. They dont care about anything else that winning whole thing, so better to think about next day
[5:22:16] SwaggWaggon: AsterY gonna be able to go into a last key with like 1 min left so good
[5:22:19] ttiewinwt: is the 28 gonna count for bonedust? did they +2 the 26?
[5:22:40] MakzzTV: aster y always with the clutch last minute runs
[5:22:45] SwaggWaggon: bonedust has a 27 spires done
[5:22:46] gourmetmilk: is shadowlands worth coming back to? I stopped shortly after beating castle nathria
[5:22:55] xNoloSun: If it was a tie now who would be second aster or echo guardians?
[5:23:01] ttiewinwt: @SwaggWaggon oh ok, thanks
[5:23:11] BUR1X: @gourmetmilk i'd say wait till 9.2 and all the new catchup mechanics are in place
[5:23:16] Lorrdzik: @ttiewinwt yes, tehy did +2 so 28 is fine to do
[5:23:18] mokasaurus: my guess is ToP
[5:23:18] osem: @gourmetmilk waste of time and money
[5:23:20] chaisebleu: @gourmetmilk if you liked 9.0, yeah. Else no
[5:23:21] Shearin77: @gourmetmilk i think it might be worth coming back when 9.2 is out
[5:23:35] stryk66: doesnt matter @xnolosun
[5:23:48] Sumirina: maybe a little before 9.2 for prep :)
[5:23:48] destress: CoS second Legion Dungeon? That´s rough ... and possibly fun :D
[5:23:52] gourmetmilk: Thanks for the replies. I saw the 9.2 trailer and was interested again. I'll probably check it out :D
[5:23:53] GenericAnimeName: they might also wait to see what the other team does, because if one of them goes for a 28 the other team kinda needs to do the same to be in control of their own destiny
[5:24:00] Shearin77: @gourmetmilk the korthia grinding is just a bore
[5:24:28] SwaggWaggon: im wondering this too
[5:24:35] Jack3213: @gourmetmilk hes right
[5:24:41] Mortaroisback: Dead game?
[5:24:49] Shearin77: @gourmetmilk you could try out some classic or tbc in the meanwhile .. i like it
[5:24:49] nothumbgamer_ttv: 9.2 m0 gear will be 230ish? so better to come back then to gear a little
[5:25:19] SyriosOne: @ttiewinwt they didnt do 26 +2, they had a 27 +1, watch the right side of their view

[5:26:17] Shearin77: 6 minutes left
[5:26:26] SwaggWaggon: wow if asterY gets into a spires they can tie sheesh
[5:26:47] Sumirina: the pressure to oneshot a 28
[5:26:49] ttiewinwt: @ttiewinwt it showed 26 +1 a bit earlier on the leaderboard that's why I asked, thanks again
[5:26:56] matching_towels: Teams are so close
[5:27:00] Alliput: why aren't they picking up their anima powers every time?
[5:27:05] dscoAU: Is Bonedust Andy's team?
[5:27:08] Shearin77: astery could just squeeze in another
[5:27:08] Dieg0te: @Warcraft Qual melhor em PVE no geral? Rogues ou WW monk?
[5:27:19] Dieg0te: @Warcraft Which is better in PVE overall? Rogues or WW Monk?
[5:27:20] Lorrdzik: @ttiewinwt ok so I mess it up with different team. But they are fine on 28
[5:27:21] SwaggWaggon: sheesh flew through this holy
[5:27:23] matching_towels: Addon auto selects power
[5:27:24] imposterkiwi: @Alliput they are, the pov is like a 6th person so it looks like it isn't picked up
[5:27:30] Sumirina: @Alliput I think that's not theirs, but just some debuf stuff the observer sees
[5:27:33] dscoAU: @Alliput They are, they just have an addon or WA that does it for them
[5:27:35] Shearin77: @Alliput they are but we can't see what they are pickking
[5:27:38] stryk66: @dieg0te da comrade

[5:28:36] muyuu: @nerdslivesmatter delusional
[5:28:38] Warblade23: Aster should go to SOA
[5:28:39] worthtv: @SwaggWaggon They can tie with echo, not sheesh
[5:28:42] SwaggWaggon: Can asterY do another key?
[5:28:46] Lerker3: cheer100 google translate "win" into eng to mandarin ==> Yíng. First letter of "ying" is Y. It's not because the symbol for "win" looks like a Y
[5:28:52] SwaggWaggon: holy nice
[5:28:53] Warblade23: Yes they can
[5:28:56] muyuu: @SwaggWaggon if they start in the next 3 mins
[5:29:30] SwaggWaggon: If sheesh can do another key thatll be insane
