[1:53:56] jamminlove: sac damage never breaks damage even if you do 100% entire hp in sac
[1:54:06] hjathemage: Heyy bradaa
[1:54:14] Fiftyswen: i swear dsac sometime takes like 3 seconds till it gets applied even if he is in range
[1:54:30] jamminlove: fear*
[1:54:32] jmakn: when i first started playing wow
[1:54:41] Turaxyy: Morning :)
[1:54:43] notmorbos: i wonder how different wotlk would be i you could see enemy comps in preparation. ig warpal would just be even more insane
[1:54:44] jamminlove: @Fiftyswen If he's in range it's instant
[1:54:50] Turaxyy: Dont trust yamoun
[1:55:04] Turaxyy: He have a fearward file
[1:55:07] jamminlove: nah we tested it in s5 with naked bois
[1:55:14] Fiftyswen: @jamminlove yeah but if he is out of range and walking in range.....its completly random
[1:55:19] Srenix: @Fiftyswen if the dmg is absorbed, it doesnt break
[1:55:20] jamminlove: warrior fear is a mechanic
[1:55:27] shucoco: I think it happens when you press dsac and warrior is out of 30yards range, then it takes like 3 seconds for warr to get it
[1:55:32] jamminlove: the target breaks insta and the aoe to the target doesn't break
[1:55:36] jamminlove: or vice versa I forget
[1:55:37] its_creepx: it dpeends if the focus fear or press fear on you
[1:55:40] jamminlove: one of them doesn't break
[1:55:53] cvsthelordx: when do we get some rdru gameplay pojke
[1:56:11] jamminlove: Absorbed damage dont count on for fear threshold
[1:56:13] jamminlove: Idk if that was it
[1:56:29] Kalimboo: doesnt even count for sheeps xd
[1:56:30] jamminlove: @Fiftyswen yep
[1:56:46] jamminlove: @Kalimboo ye it does?
[1:57:21] Kalimboo: if you dsac your warrior mate, he gets a sacred shield proc, and takes like a dot dmg into it which is absorbed, the sheep wont break no
[1:57:35] Fiftyswen: @Kalimboo ofc thats intended
[1:58:21] jamminlove: You mean you the paladin gets sheeped and it wont break ur sheep from sac? yea ofc because the warrior didnt take damage
[1:58:25] jamminlove: That's completely different
[1:58:31] BakkaTV: @cvsthelordx Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:58:46] cvsthelordx: @bakkatv gotcha brotha

[1:59:17] Eonx: Hurricanlord was spamming trade for boosts, maybe you can pay him to play with you
[1:59:18] boomiextv: @Srenix  where is robbin
[1:59:25] jamminlove: What I was talking about was fear threshold, it doesn't count absorbs @Minpojke, so say fear threshold is 10% of their HP, if shielded it's shield + 10%
