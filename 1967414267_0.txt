[1:38:55] AlphasaurusRexx: We skip ahead 200 years in the world of Azeroth. The world is stricken by famine. Food is scarce, the horde and alliance have wiped the planet of most living things just to survive. They find themselves one day in Silithus hoping for some bugs to eat when they approach the sword. Memories wash over them as they remember a time that once was and give the sword, still perfect in form, a touch resting their hand firmly on the blade only to realize it's cake and they eat it. The hunger is cured.
[1:38:56] SSD511_: @SuperLost89  why u mad that the tru ?

[2:24:07] ceodwarf420: what a clowns
[2:24:11] XshadowturkeyX: thats when you tell then your grped with the mage and then leave
[2:24:12] Ribbheden: Welcome to WoW
[2:24:16] ceodwarf420: one wipe and they kick
[2:24:20] SonofHorus82: yeah wrath pugs are the worst.
[2:24:20] LordCorgi: Why I don't play WoW period
[2:24:21] sliproach: classic + toxicity
[2:24:28] denflup: its just soft retail
[2:24:29] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:24:33] Metalcalfe: It was like that back in wrath too
[2:24:33] Mecabeast: The issue with leaving before a boss kill is the 30min debuff
[2:24:35] Nerendis: RIght because classic is so not elitest
[2:24:36] NickyNiclas: Gearscore yeah, sucks
[2:24:40] mein8: Gear score toxicity was a thing in LK
[2:24:44] Wulfgrym: its simple, remove the vote to remove
[2:24:44] ColdChillXI: Non fun gamers LUL
[2:24:45] wildwittra: what do you think about adding  m+ to classic hardcore ? would be amazing for griefing ppl
[2:24:47] flebbooo: it has, i see people asking for crazy GS for something a simple as Voa
[2:24:47] XshadowturkeyX: people see that your not 5k+ gs for gamams they try to kkick you
[2:24:48] Molvonos: I mean, when you introduce M+ like mechanics, you're gonna get M+ like responses.
[2:24:48] natalieportmanswormhole: I think the greater issue is people showing up on characters *completely* unprepared, with 0 knowledge of their abilities and not doing gamma dungeon mechanics
[2:24:48] HooDGorE: its brutal everyone thinks they're top 1%
[2:24:48] xhighpaulx: hardcores not like that
[2:24:49] ambiotic: in order to get wow to be like that again you need to have an age requirement
[2:24:50] smashwow: tbf wasn't wrath always toxic with GF? because of GS etc
[2:24:53] HatchlingMiquela: it was bad in OG wrath  days too
[2:24:55] SamDavidsin: must have higher gear score then what the place actually drops attitude
[2:24:58] Wildfire_Gaming: that's how wrath was back in the day, all trade  chat was LF xxx 5.3k gs +
[2:24:59] SonofHorus82: everyone is so set on GS when 90% of the people in pugs that have high GS all suck ass because they've been carried to that high GS.
[2:25:01] joberloh: @Towelliee that's why you need to hop on the Old Blanchy server - total dad server
[2:25:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: you gonna watch that ghostcrawler stream next week about his new mmo?
[2:25:07] natalieportmanswormhole: ex: no gems, enchants, communal items equipped etc
[2:25:10] bypized: He is a TBC guy
[2:25:12] Nerendis: I've never experienced more elitest (you can't play this/that etc) than in 2019 classic
[2:25:19] ArcaneSyntax: Esfands in a bubble, classic has always been giga elitist. Even more than retail.
[2:25:23] sliproach: @mein8  yeah that dam addon you needed to just be able to play
[2:25:27] Wulfgrym: i want to play wrath but after watching these groups i don't think im going to
[2:25:28] Raidr211: it gave me Deserter debuff too.  lame
[2:25:28] mavericks312: I mean I get it he is a tbc full classic feel guy
[2:25:30] Truckwood: @Towelliee when are you leaving? I think you said youre only an hour or so
[2:25:37] Verrekk: you must already be past the point of needing anything from it to get invited to do it
[2:25:38] c0mmander_starscream: one wipe and kick? What are these people they think it's 2006???
[2:25:40] dannyis1337: what if classic + is just M+ on classic lol
[2:25:46] Nachozdood: lol he also dislikes wrath/cata pally cause its not afk auto attacking and watching chat
[2:25:53] bypized: But I feel that in a way Classic Vanilla is even more elitist. Wrath gives you the opportunity
[2:25:53] ijuki: Sounds like esfand is salty Kappa
[2:25:54] Raidr211: i wasnt even bottom dps
[2:26:07] MILESkg21: i dont remember it being this hard back in the day
[2:26:10] Wulfgrym: i love the comment, these players think they are the top 1% KEKW
[2:26:16] sotsil_: @Towelliee i would be nowhere without my healer friend. i joined late the wrath train and i am 243 now and can barely get into anywhere cause peopole wanna do heroic bosses and dnt take lowish people anymore

[2:50:23] Playermodd: I think wow 2 is in the works
[2:50:23] Molvonos: Because of how braindead the hopium is.
[2:50:24] Nerendis: It's impossible to appease classic andies. They will complain about literally anything.
[2:50:30] TheMysticBean: @RingoDingoDoo dont think thats what people want though
[2:50:34] borgmanson: Scarlet Crusade raid
[2:50:34] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee Wrath of Lich King has content that never came out when it launched that they could add :D I hope they do that
[2:50:38] dapeanutbutter: The year is 3569. Blizzard announces fresh Classic servers. Blizzcon goes wild.
[2:50:38] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:50:39] MILESkg21: once you add content to old stuff its no longer CLASSIC. it's RETAIL
[2:50:39] Xaviwan078: i want a wow retail revamp but ...i can dream
[2:50:41] shado_wansu: What if there was a Classic+ project to restore "cut content" that never got in the first time?
[2:50:49] its____rooster: @Syrc0 that would be cool
[2:50:51] DeanoTV: @MILESkg21 trueee
[2:50:53] WytChapp: Asmon and esfand man they go crazy with vanilla classic shit
[2:50:54] jmalmin: Dont see a classic + mode. it would rub way to many people the wrong way.
[2:50:55] Genilort: wow battle royal
[2:50:56] Molvonos: After Blizzcon, I'm blacklisting 'Classic+'.
[2:50:57] 123Sepi123: classic is the next retail expac!
[2:50:58] Molvonos: lol
[2:51:01] dracullus: new classic raid, imagine wasting resources like that LUL
[2:51:02] Rictamar: there is some merit to it, OSRS for example is 4 times as popular than RS3, this is what the hope for Classic is
[2:51:09] WHJustice: Classic+ Pog
[2:51:10] RingoDingoDoo: it was cut for a reason, don't put too much hope that's going to be awesome
[2:51:10] bankzint: season is a good idea, but they need to add new content/gimmick each new season.
[2:51:11] SamDavidsin: cant wait to run more recycled mythic+ !!
[2:51:13] Jadateam: maybe thats the secret  :)
[2:51:14] feherlofia123: Theyre not gonna run 2 mmos
[2:51:17] unsteddy: Imagine: "There will be no cata, you can transfer to retail with all achivs etc"  The retail collectors will be malding
[2:51:20] flookguy: Id just be happy to get rid of rep grind to finish the main story‚Ä¶
[2:51:21] Xaviwan078: next super extra mega classic edition !
[2:51:34] madhatterui: i've been playing for 18 years, and i really hope they don't add anything to classic
[2:51:35] DunzoCD: @Molvonos im with you, its so exhausting hearing them shit on retail like classic+ is some godsend game and would be infinitely better
[2:51:36] ZansTeamCaptain: :(
[2:51:37] TheMysticBean: @feherlofia123 theyre already running 4 though
[2:51:40] Nerendis: "Classic +: fuck you for asking"
[2:51:41] Blueplzz: Is they did Classic+ content retail would probably need a version of it.
[2:51:41] PotbellyGoat: can't wait for Rumble+
[2:51:42] wildwittra: a new 1-60 Classic experience (new realms) with additional cata zones would be amazing
[2:51:43] MILESkg21: u think u do but u dont KEKW
[2:51:44] RingoDingoDoo: towelliee a retail fan huh?
[2:51:44] tmiguel27: nah i prefer ++
[2:51:52] notColt45: Classic Max Plus
[2:51:55] Playermodd: cata isnt classic, its reforge
[2:51:56] Nachozdood: Classic pluse.....you mean every expansion that came after vanilla
[2:51:57] sm0lp: My fear is having two timelines to wow to keep up with, i'd scream
[2:51:58] AnimalCrackers_19: I would like Retail++
[2:52:00] Ariesian76: Draenor Classic ++ KEKW
[2:52:02] Zander_TheGamer: I just want Legion Classic honestly. WoD classic would be cool with a shortened content rollout schedule.
[2:52:05] Gezber: WoW Chocolate-Vanilla Wombo Combo EZ
[2:52:07] Aierwin: Classic + with no level cap increase. Just new content, raids / dungeons etc.
[2:52:11] gongfella: WTB MOP classic
[2:52:12] dracullus: imagine big animation changing classic+ logo to cataclysm Kappa
[2:52:12] Masqerader: Classic +  - Our bosses do 3 mechanics now!
[2:52:15] Molvonos: 'How to tell you're new to the channel without saying you're new to the channel.'
[2:52:16] Necrootide: "You think you do, but you don't"
[2:52:17] flebbooo: Give me wod with the cut content
[2:52:17] MILESkg21: WOD classic i would LEAP OUT MY WINDOW
[2:52:18] Phaquel: what is classic+ ?
[2:52:20] ARX_MT: Yo sup towellie

[2:52:20] mavros_kyrios: UI for Wrath???
[2:52:22] Molvonos: 'You like retail?'
[2:52:24] feherlofia123: @themysticbean  3 of em are copy pasta games, theres no actual development behind em
[2:52:27] GuyInRobe: Wait... Towelliee not at Blizzcon! I loved meeting you for MoP announcement!
[2:52:28] tmiguel27: Classic + Ultra danKEK2
[2:52:41] Xaviwan078: i want wow retail revamp and housing ....probably wont happen but will see continue  i playing the game anyway
[2:52:41] Playermodd: I think with how popular classic is, and with henzen being back.. wow 2 is probably being worked on
[2:52:41] RingoDingoDoo: Blizzard have an ego, it feels like they begrudgingly did classic, so i doubt they will want to give people what they want
[2:52:42] DeanoTV: BC....
[2:52:43] madhatterui: yes, exactly
[2:52:43] Jadateam: classic +  / new content & make option to play HC  :)
[2:52:43] conquestandvictory: Classic WoD + with tons of new content, lul.
[2:52:44] Cru3: good morning towelliee, been awhile.. looking great bro
[2:52:51] Rictamar: yeh they are never adding a brand new xpac just for classic lol
[2:52:53] Zander_TheGamer: Classic+ is such a dumb idea
[2:52:54] jmalmin: Blizzard have already given Lich king a + mode with the HC+.
[2:52:54] shado_wansu: Chromie Time!
[2:52:54] Rictamar: they are delusional
[2:52:58] UnearthedSin: I don't think it gets added to retail.
[2:52:59] flookguy: I think it would be cool to just have a separate version where you can start in vanilla and work up all the way to idk like BFA. No resets though
[2:53:01] LordCorgi: Just keep it Classic, and just add the original zones they were planning on, no expansions
[2:53:03] fcsgamer: They dont need to add to retail, like runescape did
[2:53:04] Larc9783: They just say the bronze dragons did it and its another timeline
[2:53:08] ZansTeamCaptain: timeline split
[2:53:09] MILESkg21: it affects everything
[2:53:11] Gravy_Gator: Just make classic+ have the systems retail like cross server stuff, updated textures, and updated models. Like they have all of it already.
[2:53:13] Arocian: haha hopium
[2:53:13] ContraRob: If they go the OSRS route, they wouldn't add it to retail
[2:53:15] Baldarsar: they should stop with Wrath classic, because Cata changes the would like it is now basiclly !!!
[2:53:16] Wurpd: Don't add to retail. Make it to different games.
[2:53:16] Grimfyre: It wouldn't effect retail... two different timelines
[2:53:16] lordmyer: I think classic + plus would be a great place for them to beta test ideas and such @Towelliee
[2:53:17] Molvonos: It stops being classic at that point
[2:53:18] Jarlan23: i hope they add vulpera to classic so they lose their fucking minds
[2:53:18] MILESkg21: then its just the MULTIVERSE in wow
[2:53:22] maxmorey: Retail is an entirely different game
[2:53:23] spirk_0: Its all jailer secret plan
[2:53:25] Agk90_: Wow multiverse
[2:53:27] hazmat406: why does the timeline matter if theyre going to make more money
[2:53:27] PokerFaceMoose: this stuff also happened just elsewhere
[2:53:29] Rudric_Ice: retail has its own thing
[2:53:30] vladthethi: cata comming ?
[2:53:31] Molvonos: I mean, it's a fucking mongrel of classic now with all the shit they've added.
[2:53:33] Endin: multiverse all solved
[2:53:37] Molvonos: But it's no classic.
[2:53:39] Frosted2319: and splitting player base hard
[2:53:39] WeE_wOo_WhEn: thats what Chromie is for, right?
[2:53:40] kaos4666: Loki ref
[2:53:41] GuyInRobe: I mean wasnt WoD already a branch?
[2:53:46] borgmanson: Emerald dream in Classic+ AND Emerald dream for next Retail expansion???
[2:53:47] Coldfire989: Cromie
[2:53:48] DunzoCD: im going to laugh so hard when classic "plus" becomes too meta and hard and they wish it was just classic again
[2:53:48] coldrobe27: coldrobe27 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:53:48] sm0lp: Please no Multiverse
[2:53:49] madhatterui: splitting playerbase is never good
[2:53:50] Molvonos: The moment you add brand new content to 'Classic', it becomes Retail.
[2:53:51] SonofHorus82: so... it's a Loki variant?
[2:53:56] RingoDingoDoo: why couldn't they skip cata and go to MOP?
[2:53:57] PokerFaceMoose: they already made a multiverse, so  they can do anything right
[2:53:57] Rictamar: chat, they aren't going to make a classic only xpac with brand new content only for that version, its never happening lol
[2:53:59] unsteddy: Imagine they let you portal to classic/retail/wotlk on same char
[2:54:00] Hypertitan: there's going to have to be some sort of "merging" of the two....I have no idea how you go about that but yeah...that's a long thought that involves a lot of time and expanding upson haha
[2:54:02] Molvonos: No matter the mental gymnastics you put yourself through to say otherwise.
[2:54:04] Larc9783: Yeah they just say its a timeline you can visit like in Valdraken
[2:54:04] Jadateam: TBC classic HC option

[2:54:10] Scoodles91: they havent watched flash, adn all the bad things from flashpoint
[2:54:13] yib_: @RingoDingoDoo cause cata wasnt bad?
[2:54:14] formal_____: exactly, people think classic+ is the future of WoW they aren't just gonna say look f you retail players and switch full focus onto classic and gut everything everyones earnt on retail
[2:54:15] PokerFaceMoose: @Molvonos its retail with crappier graphics
[2:54:18] shado_wansu: Yeah but with what they did with Nozdormu I feel like time shenanigans would be the best way to explain it.
[2:54:19] Mattven: it is simple no changes
[2:54:21] MrGrimms: Good Morning @Towelliee you ready for today?
[2:54:24] MILESkg21: cata was great until DS

[2:54:35] TheMysticBean: @feherlofia123 still running and maintaining the servers / fixing bugs for them. Costs resources
[2:54:36] Lloydbanksz: the only classic ill play is classic legion
[2:54:41] niikatnight: going to cata IMO goes against why the bought classic back
[2:54:41] RingoDingoDoo: cata, WOD and Shadowlands were all poor
[2:54:41] Genilort: all went to hell after mop
[2:54:42] MattyNiceTV: do you think they are going back through the entire timeline again?
[2:54:42] unsteddy: not skipping BFA KEKW
[2:54:42] Roobi_doobi: they wont go that far
[2:54:44] hazmat406: do you think theyre going to re release all their expansions even though the community perception may be to skip an expansion?

[2:54:50] OnePlayerPete: Hyped for Shadowlands Classic!!!
[2:54:53] happyspot: I feel like the compacted rollout of classic patches will help a lot of the xpacks like wod if they ever do that
[2:54:53] ShowDUH: they just won'T go down that far down the road lol
[2:54:53] Calphurnious: the players will skip SL though

[2:55:03] Masqerader: u want the classic experience u, u get to suffer all the indignities of each one you love or hate
[2:55:07] Kakotan2143: without shadowlands, we wouldnt have the content of the upcoming patch lol
[2:55:07] Beebooga: people are hoping it'll be successful like OSRS but that will not happen lol
[2:55:13] mavericks312: You can tell who hasn‚Äôt actually played cata who thinks it‚Äôs bad
[2:55:15] PokerFaceMoose: your finger legit blocks stuff when pvping
[2:55:15] Hypertitan: i had an amazing time during classic when it was current...i was never one that had the interest to go back to it
[2:55:18] kyotoboss: @Jadateam no they should keep it on classik , if youre level 70 character with t6 and glaives die , bro that not healthy for your mental health
[2:55:19] sbrice87: Lol right

[2:55:52] Jarlan23: but idk what it is
[2:55:57] ARX_MT: Any new expansion anouncement for retail ? What do you say ?
[2:56:04] Aierwin: How harsh is the pay to win aspect on rumble?
[2:56:09] Aierwin: Not touched it yet
[2:56:18] Meanseason: Do you have ; or are you making a community guild for rumble? @towelliee

[2:56:39] Meanseason: 15 man guild sizes seems kinda dated

[2:56:41] funviking99: If u guys want to download
[2:56:41] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee are you going to play FF14s new expansion when it comes out?

[2:56:52] MrGrimms: @Towelliee what build are you playing in rumble?
[2:56:53] EfnetLemons: why are u not going to blizzcon
[2:57:10] BlueBlurPrime: I wonder if the raid in rumble will take 5 players
[2:57:15] borgmanson: Diablo Immortal should have been a lesson. Always port to PC
[2:57:16] tonyr23: Tried rumble this morning and it's pretty addicting
[2:57:17] MrGrimms: hahaha that sucks
[2:57:19] tmiguel27: For me Classic and Classic Hardcore without Wrath was fine adding Wrath i think was too much but thats my opinion, they should at least upgrade classic and wrath with the retail UI.

[3:17:44] Angelraven13: üòä
[3:17:44] JasperCalico: just bc YOU can't do it doesn't mean other people can't LuL
[3:17:47] vic_ave: yes
[3:17:52] TheMysticBean: @WytChapp Yeah big difference between keyboard and a controller
[3:17:53] vic_ave: when you are small
[3:17:53] Gravy_Gator: Yes, or you can kill it immediately for a DPS buff
[3:17:53] ShieldslamTV: Yup @Towelliee
[3:18:16] TmT_eh: I want see some blizzard characters show up in Killer Instinct :D
[3:18:24] Molvonos: @PrincessAww Just because other people can do it, doesn't mean the general population wants to suffer through the slog of people who are sub-par on controller just so they can play on console.
[3:18:25] Molvonos: Be realistic.
[3:18:28] TheMysticBean: @PrincessAww playing DH by any chance? LUL
[3:18:32] R0t0kan: there is like 3 people waiting on wow on console
[3:18:33] Erielle04: WoW on console KEKW
[3:18:35] Korupcija_: they will have to split classic/retail on twitch after today so we can find retail streamers
[3:18:41] Rafaelfrost_: is the hype fading today or what is going on?!
[3:18:41] MattJ063: I think Phil Spencer makes an appearance
[3:18:42] rymerre: gamepass is def possible...theres mods to play WoW classic with a controller so...
[3:18:45] PetitHallow: Spartan class
[3:18:46] wakeandbacon95: maybe next year dunno
[3:18:49] see_kay: the only way they would announce wow coming to console, is if they were already working on it for a while
[3:18:53] Utmost777: no way you could play Shaman on console lol
[3:18:55] TweektheProphet: I would just see them coming out saying we look fwd to our partnership and that is about it
[3:18:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: It would take years of development to get WoW onto console, yeah
[3:18:59] Xtr0city: Warcraft rumble on game pass
[3:19:04] MILESkg21: the only one that works on console is FF14
[3:19:06] borgmanson: Master Chief coming to HOTS
[3:19:07] R0t0kan: gamepass is not going to happen why do people think this is a thing
[3:19:11] R0t0kan: why would they throw money away
[3:19:13] rymerre: i know people who are playing WoW on the rog ally just fine

[3:19:42] R0t0kan: i have 3 rows of keybinds and thats not enough
[3:19:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: The hardware can handle it, but they need slick systems like FFXIV have to make all the buttons easy to use
[3:19:50] R0t0kan: healer is different
[3:19:59] JasperCalico: @Molvonos wow players already filter who they play with. If they don't wanna play with console players then that's their choice but no reason to be upset at just the thought of it coming to console LuL
[3:20:01] rymerre: im playing the shit out of rumble right now lol
[3:20:05] TheMysticBean: At least let us know who's on controller and whos MKB so we know who to avoid in groups
[3:20:08] Masqerader: @wEiRdO_dUdE ff14 was designed for console first
[3:20:11] PetitHallow: @ralticz me neither but people who continuously say ‚ÄúI use 4 buttons for my veng dh‚Äù like what how many abilities aren‚Äôt you utilizing
[3:20:20] Erielle04: it would require significant changes to the game which would also effect PC
[3:20:25] Nebulizer87: You could have console WoW but I would keep servers seperate
[3:20:29] deadeyedjedi: i played warlock on controller in TBC and that was rough, i cant imagine playing it now lol
[3:20:32] Xtr0city: @thorh13 I was just spitting out random thoughts
[3:20:42] wreckshoptv: you think we get new races tow
[3:20:46] eyekahnography: you use 4 buttons just to attack.  That's not counting the CDs and utilities on Vengeance XD
[3:20:48] the_rendr: wow on console without addons... I can already see the internet exploding
[3:20:51] R0t0kan: @PetitHallow yeah i always find that funny. trust if there was a class that only used 4 buttons like 80% of wow would be playing it
[3:20:51] SonofHorus82: you dont want to skip in gammas. all bosses drop Scourgestones taht you can use to buy TOC 25n gear.
[3:20:53] gothen123: !blizzard prediction
[3:20:54] Molvonos: @PrincessAww I don't think anyone here is 'upset' at the idea of it.  They might think it's a waste of resources, sure, and perhaps they're warning others against the stigma that would come from it.
[3:20:56] Molvonos: But not upset.
[3:20:58] MortiousPrime: Honestly, the ConsolePort addon makes controllers pretty easy
[3:21:03] symbiosis11845: They also never released a spec mid-expansion :D
[3:21:04] Frozen_DK: new allied race ?
[3:21:08] vaironixx: there was a new race/class last expack

[3:21:21] TheMysticBean: @R0t0kan There is, its called havoc demon hunter
[3:21:21] zeitgeiz: Probably at a point where we get new specs instead of classes
[3:21:26] Gilromi: Do you think they are gonna rework classes to be supports?
[3:21:29] TweektheProphet: Shamons for all races for 11.0
[3:21:32] JasperCalico: @Molvonos I've seen the community post. They're upset, maybe not all but the vocal majority sure is LuL

[3:21:53] vaironixx: dude DH deserves a 3rd spec
[3:21:55] zeitgeiz: Hero specs instead of classes

[3:22:29] Mogalixir: I want to be able to class change like Final Fantasy.
[3:22:29] Protege_TV: so many specs have low rep. theyre gonna revamp specs like Mistweaver, disc, survival, etc
[3:22:29] rymerre: they have to drop the balls
[3:22:33] Hazey90: ive never played WoW properly before, is it worth getting into as a new player now in retail?

[3:37:34] TheMysticBean: @mavericks312 cata was the end of wow as we knew it, and the start of something worse
[3:37:37] veryhairyheyyall: I‚Äôm confused by looking at this towHAMUP
[3:37:54] Rodenbo: Cataclysm on is actually WOW 2
[3:38:08] EarthRocker: EarthRocker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:38:14] mavericks312: @themysticbean how did it get worse when you could argue legion and DF are the top 2 xpacs
[3:38:27] Molvonos: @mavericks312 I didn't like most of it.  How disjointed the zones were from one another (especially as a farmer), how absolute trash farming cat tails in Uldum was, since it only spawned along that one river and there were 20 people farming it at any time.  The rehashed raid bosses (Onyxia, Nefarian, Ragnaros).
[3:38:31] neftario105: @rodenbo really so cool üòé
[3:38:34] DunzoCD: @TheMysticBean thats just like your opinion bro doesnt mean its true
[3:38:43] Molvonos: It was the only expansion I didn't resubscribe to until the end.
[3:38:56] TheMysticBean: @mavericks312 DF in the top expac? Why are the numbers at the lowest theyve been if thats the case
[3:39:09] phisig: This work day is going so slow... I ready for the weekend already
[3:39:09] Rodenbo: DF season 2 ruined DF
[3:39:16] dwolters_the_zombieman: @veryhairyheyyall it's Eastern Kingdom that some someone revamp as a meme
[3:39:20] ashwing_: @TheMysticBean where is your data as proof??
[3:39:21] Rodenbo: DF was in line to be the best expansion of all time
[3:39:22] neftario105: I begin playing wow on Warlords of Draenor
[3:39:24] Tidus99: what time does blizzcon start EST time can anyone tell me ?
[3:39:24] Molvonos: I love it when people use such strong words.
[3:39:26] Molvonos: Like 'Ruined'.
[3:39:31] Molvonos: Speak for yourself and only yourself.
[3:39:33] mavericks312: @themysticbean because it followed up shadowlands which a was garbage
[3:39:35] Molvonos: You don't speak for me or anyone else.
[3:39:37] Aimessan: 2
[3:39:41] Anzel_1: @Rodenbo Bad take, you just dont like the seasonal model
[3:39:42] halnoth: @mavericks312 the writing in DF is pretty bad imo
[3:39:45] Anzel_1: @Molvonos Yeah KEKW
[3:39:51] Hu33ard: @mavericks312 shadowlands was good imo
[3:39:51] mavericks312: Same thing happened to legion right after WoD
[3:39:52] Zedar_Frost: @neftario105 I‚Äôm so sorry
[3:39:58] TheMysticBean: @DunzoCD raid finder and rbgs were not a good implementation
[3:40:13] dracullus: quick take screenshots, Towellie left important data on his desktop
[3:40:16] Rodenbo: @Anzel_1 no, i don't like how the top 5 specs are so locked in and it's the worst meta of any game I've ever seen, and they just let it ride for 3 months
[3:40:18] Neowanderer: i like early cata but the deathwing raid was trash
[3:40:24] TheMysticBean: @mavericks312 Then if it was so good it should have brought people back right? or at least kept the same players left over from SL
[3:40:25] Anzel_1: @TheMysticBean bad take, RF and RBGS were/are fun
[3:40:26] mavericks312: @themysticbean so you want the features of classic still implemented to this day?
[3:40:28] neftario105: @zedar_frost  ty üòä  have a great day
[3:40:51] Neowanderer: i like that you had to cc and the dungeons were hard

[3:41:09] TheMysticBean: @mavericks312 No, but the "mmo" feel of retail is dead. its an instanced game right now
[3:41:10] Rodenbo: you clearly weren't doing 23s+ at the start of season 2
[3:41:16] DunzoCD: @DunzoCD thats just false, raid finder is the way most casuals experience the raid, and rbgs are great and they are making them solo queuable because peple like them
[3:41:21] Molvonos: @Rodenbo There's always been a hard meta though, in almost every expansion.  DF isnt any different.  People are just hyperfixated on the 'God Comp' because it has Augment Evokers in it.

[3:41:48] Molvonos: If the Aug Evoker wasnt there, it'd be a Demo Lock or Combat Rogue.
[3:41:50] Molvonos: Or something else.
[3:41:52] Rodenbo: @Molvonos wrong, the meta has NEVER been this locked inf or this long. I went back and looked and there was never a locked in 5 specs for this long, with no one breaking in at all
[3:41:57] Xaviwan078: my main will be a Banan`dorei the racial are soo cool

[3:42:20] Anzel_1: @Historyxxx WHAT
[3:42:22] Rodenbo: sure, the meta in the past has been 8 or so specs, but it's never been exactly 5 for this long
[3:42:25] Historyxxx: Embrace of sargaras
[3:42:27] TheMysticBean: @Sicknessqt Exactly the reason why people are playing classic over retail is the "mmo feel".

[3:43:32] Animeinn: Is that westeros?
[3:43:36] mavericks312: Just say you don‚Äôt want casuals to play the game at that point when there the majority of the money base
[3:43:45] Sicknessqt: @TheMysticBean classic is boring as hell tho so if thats ur mmo feel then i dont want it LUL
[3:43:52] Dazdari: I've only typed in trade chat for about a year now
[3:44:02] neftario105: Casual players are cool üòé
[3:44:06] mavericks312: @themysticbean guess what when you go outside in the real world there is almost no social interaction it‚Äôs not that big a deal
[3:44:09] Molvonos: @TheMysticBean There's as much social interaction in Retail as there is in Classic, it's simply shifted.  I'm very social with my guild and  my cross-faction raid group.
[3:44:15] TheMysticBean: @Sicknessqt Maybe so but its more popular than retail currently LUL
[3:44:17] MattyNiceTV: what would you do without lulu
[3:44:18] Rodenbo: finding groups for M+ over 20 is the worst experience in wow, but it's the majority of the end game
[3:44:19] smashwow: lol about that

[3:44:46] SpilledMelk: I just put gas in my car.

[3:45:05] rphtx: lolz ev
[3:45:07] raldrik: cooler out using less AC?
[3:45:09] TheMysticBean: @Molvonos That's just not true at all, you cant do anything in classic for end game without actually talking to people. wow everything is a queue
[3:45:09] Anzel_1: @mavericks312 Vibes
[3:45:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: got that 30 miles DLC pack Kappa

[3:45:18] RagingPunk: oh shit that leak
[3:45:20] RhadigarTV: I filled up the hybrid yesterday. Loving that 450 miles to a tank of gas
[3:45:21] smashwow: i'm actually surprised that the car doesn't have an alert that goes to your phone when it gets to X% so you know when you should charge it
[3:45:24] MoodyVanessa: @Historyxxx i would be surprised if that's real lol
[3:45:26] Helltz68: the outside temp can effect MPG and its just a guess that they do
[3:45:29] UltraKSlaya: wow that leak looks real
[3:45:29] SpilledMelk: EV is a joke
[3:45:30] Sarcastard: the mach e was remastered?
[3:45:33] jmalmin: hehe Embrace of Sargaras. :D that is a good one. Its the sword mentioned in the program isnt it. I am sure that sword is a nice statue.
[3:45:33] cripplious: without lulu towelliee would be homeless and offering gaming tips for food
[3:45:37] JasperCalico: is the leak is real blizz video quality has gone down the drain

[3:45:50] neftario105: Leak*
[3:45:53] Rodenbo: @Anzel_1 forming your own group is nice and all, but you get nothing but people signing up for dungeons they are not capable of doing and if you say I'm wrong you are lying to yourself
[3:46:17] MythicSam: youre gonna kill it
[3:46:20] c0mmander_starscream: What time is your event?

[3:46:31] Veyronn_00: get a poop bucket
[3:46:33] MizixTV: Hey @Towelliee, since your rumble guild is full, I went and made my own. Do you mind if I give out the name so others in the community can join?
[3:46:34] captivate7: nervous poops totally nervous

[3:47:17] dmaa17: im hoping they announce that theyre hiring more people for customer support to answer tickets :D
[3:47:17] Anzel_1: @mavericks312 im saying that's what they think makes for a higher playerbase, just vibes lol I see more folks on classic just on a whim.
[3:47:19] UltraKSlaya: I'm on a carnivore diet too lol
[3:47:21] desmo7: hows the crnivore diet
[3:47:24] Kinghorn: yum
[3:47:26] c0mmander_starscream: Oh perfect
[3:47:27] qrazieee: I also want to poop! It is hard for me!
[3:47:27] Rodenbo: @Anzel_1 lol what a vibe you are. I was doing 24s at the start of season 2. when i would try and push my own 21 or 22 up, the majority of people signing up hadn't even done 20s. don't try and get combative for no reason
[3:47:29] MILESkg21: LuL
[3:47:30] UltraKSlaya: focus on the protein!
[3:47:30] brentosxd: Love that picture on twitter with bellular and panda KEKW
[3:47:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: blizzcon shits are the worst
[3:47:36] desmo7: benefits of carnivore diet?
[3:47:42] raldrik: brand new word folks GIGApoop
[3:47:45] neftario105: @towelliee looks like a gangsta üòé
[3:47:45] Erielle04: push, nice joke

[3:47:50] Sarcastard: XLAX MOCHA
[3:47:51] king_waltzy: its not a con if you dont bomb the bathroom
[3:47:59] Anzel_1: @Rodenbo I'm just saying, man. it's not combative, I just dont agree with you
[3:48:10] Shadowlemur01: @Towelliee what did you do to lose the weight? any special diets? I gained 60 pounds in 3 years after leaving the army and I feel like shit
[3:48:13] Sylphy_TV: grimQ
[3:48:15] Metket: BALLS TO THE WALLS MAN

[3:48:25] c0mmander_starscream: @desmo7 drop weight fast, not sure about the long term effects on the colon
[3:48:28] Henke1983: imodium is a lifesaver
[3:48:29] chriswrites: @Towelliee i came back from Japan recently and pooping in America is so sad. Japan has superior toilets
[3:48:34] neftario105: Cool
[3:48:34] smashwow: yeah being out and about and having to go number 2. dealing with the hover and sandpaper = ijpNOPERS ijpNOPERS ijpNOPERS
[3:48:42] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @DeanoTV (warning)
[3:48:42] Rodenbo: @Anzel_1 it's just not an opinion. if you post a 25, 75% of the people that sign up won't have even done a 23 or 24. it's just fact

[3:49:30] Sicknessqt: Assloren
[3:49:31] Ellycat1: Avalorant danKappa
[3:49:32] c0mmander_starscream: SO is Blizzz going be like "Does anyone have a phone" today?
[3:49:35] Ribastur0075: Khaz Algar
[3:49:40] Juggernaught1989: no thanks
[3:49:45] LeDerpski: no thanks
[3:49:47] captain_khyzan: but then its not classic?
[3:49:52] xALcaPWNedx: Nope
[3:49:53] desmo7: too convoluted
[3:49:53] MILESkg21: no way LuL
[3:49:53] brentosxd: that would be confusing imo
[3:49:53] BubbaChubbs420: whow
[3:49:54] Nerendis: That's a no from me dog
[3:49:55] mavericks312: How would race to world first work the
[3:49:57] BubbaChubbs420: calm down now
[3:49:58] Rakim88: this man is cooking... idk what tho
[3:50:00] Seathasky: It would be cool for like an event
[3:50:01] TLew02: He knows!
[3:50:02] DunzoCD: itd be too hard for the classic players
[3:50:04] Seathasky: but not for full raid
[3:50:04] Subjektive: next expansion for wow is World of Warcraft: Ashes of Star Citizen 2042 :P
[3:50:05] xALcaPWNedx: Classic and retail shouldn‚Äôt bleed together
[3:50:05] vaironixx: imagine flying through a gate and it becomes classic
[3:50:06] CatsRusOfficial: I have already said this: Chrome Time interdouces a new feature called TIMELINES.   You get to time travel via the timelines. Now if you go back intime with your character then you will have to pay but going forward is free.
[3:50:08] neftario105: Cool
[3:50:08] mavericks312: But then classic is just retail
[3:50:09] Husskarl: People who play classic want the old world filled out first
[3:50:09] 770Cash: dont forget your thorns buff in dungeons
[3:50:10] AnimalCrackers_19: Is this new Towelliee leaks?
[3:50:18] Seathasky: like Ony for instance
[3:50:19] Rodenbo: imagine classic diverts from the timeline and creates it's own expansions
[3:50:21] Seathasky: but not a full raid
[3:50:25] CuNiTv: That would be weird because no character or story could take place that hints about anything that happened after classic
[3:50:26] Xsidious: My body is ready Kreygasm
[3:50:29] Sicknessqt: 2 hours Kreygasm
[3:50:29] Tjoertell: Hot Take.  Retail and Classic both get the SAME expansion.  Check and Mate.
[3:50:29] dv_domino: the retail randy's
[3:50:30] Cloudemon: Classic would just get the lfr version of the retail raid
[3:50:35] Utmost777: @mavericks312 what do you think Classic+ would be?
[3:50:38] maccaruso: They couldn't do that.  They would have to balance around two different talent/play systems
[3:50:42] xALcaPWNedx: Take classic on a different path - but then we open the door to a multiverse lol
[3:50:55] Rodenbo: I think classic gets it's own direction and new set of expansions
[3:51:00] Cry0nicS: In the email Blizz just sent they said opening ceremony is in 7 minutes... not 2h and 7 minute. The email even has a coundown....
[3:51:01] 770Cash: i forgot youre on mankrik too lol
[3:51:07] Sicknessqt: @cloudemon Classic players cant overcome lfr LUL they cant press more than 1 button properly
[3:51:08] borgmanson: Evil Thrall and Good Guy Deathwing
[3:51:15] Foxman500: Just have the new expansion be in the past for classic and in the future for retail
[3:51:29] Rodenbo: a lot of people say cataclysm is when wow went downhill. what if instead of cataclysm, they make X new expansion and we play an alternate timeline of wow
[3:51:41] TheRealAxiom: He knows already and this is all hype
[3:51:42] blade_killa: same i feel that
[3:51:44] Seathasky: I like your idea Towelliee
[3:51:47] TheRealAxiom: spill it @Towelliee
[3:51:49] dv_domino: you want blizz to think?
[3:51:51] dmaa17: have they announced or said who the last boss is in dragonflight?
[3:51:57] Sicknessqt: Too many mmos coming out. They gotta innovate
[3:51:57] Xsidious: Unreal Engine??
[3:52:00] smashwow: towHesaidit towHesaidit
[3:52:01] frozwa: Happy blizzcon day :D <3
[3:52:03] jmalmin: I just hope there are some good  systems in this new expansion.
[3:52:07] brentosxd: i just hope blizzard are capable of making new games and retaining players instead of killing games like diablo,starcraft,hots
[3:52:14] veryhairyheyyall: Towel we need housing
[3:52:17] SpilledMelk: I feel like Wow is great, but I honestly think ff14 is better right now
[3:52:18] veryhairyheyyall: Lol
[3:52:19] NickLeonhearth: You can modify content in classic WoW, but you cannot add new content to CLASSIC, that's how it works, and I feel ppl will be disappointed today
[3:52:22] Aidler: Aidler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months, currently on a 74 month streak! 
[3:52:26] neftario105: Yes u did
[3:52:30] beefy_cheez: A new classic xpac mirroring TBC/WOTLK era but new content.
[3:52:32] symbiosis11845: Do you think theres a chance we could get Class Skins coming to 11.0 ?
[3:52:42] dankmeliodas: Give me playable Naga and I‚Äôm good
[3:52:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: We love it spicy
[3:52:45] Rodenbo: classic + retail integration. you can use the same character on both. 2 different sets of gear
[3:52:47] vic_ave: affix
[3:52:53] vic_ave: they hurt alot if you don't kill them
[3:52:59] applefactory: don't understand the fixation with housing.
[3:53:02] smashwow: @Xsidious nah you don't want that. you think you do. but the optimization for an MMO in that would be awful.
[3:53:09] 770Cash: its the thorns lol
[3:53:09] marshallx: Thorns is OP
[3:53:12] borgmanson: THORNS LUL
[3:53:16] SpilledMelk: Mirrors have like 1 hp.
[3:53:18] Rodenbo: people think they want housing, but they don't. it's just a meme at this point that wow players want housing
[3:53:25] Vicrum: mythic plus in wotlk?
[3:53:30] 770Cash: i dont think the casters grabbed their buff
[3:53:38] wakeandbacon95: pally ownz
[3:53:41] Apesbaby: Apesbaby subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Yoooo
[3:53:51] SpilledMelk: Need to kill mirrors fast
[3:54:02] Sicknessqt: Nothing is tho
[3:54:07] Hypertitan: there's pretty much no downside to adding housing
[3:54:09] peardraxz: Like garrison?
[3:54:10] beefy_cheez: Classic m+ seasons. Dungeons from each xpac as the rotation
[3:54:11] REDSUNDERGROUND: 2 words GUILD HALLS
[3:54:12] MILESkg21: its no bigger meme then dance studio Kappa
[3:54:12] Krajn: how many hours to blizzcon starts?
[3:54:13] applefactory: Huge resources to implement, and I can imagine it going the way of garrisons...
[3:54:14] ZeusDNA: I wouldn't mind housing being added just as af un thing.
[3:54:15] z3rodown: Make it like pets, you can farm old content to get new blueprints to make items
[3:54:15] MILESkg21: than*
[3:54:20] marshallx: Bring back pull limits on final bosses like ICC. Reward skill - not time.
[3:54:21] runningbulls: Blizzard needs the steal the guild ships from starwars
[3:54:21] Mister_Ript: They've said multiple times that they'll "never" do player housing because it adds virtually nothing to the game and takes an insane amount of dev time and money.
[3:54:24] its____rooster: a.k.a. garrisons
[3:54:24] desmo7: havent we learned from garrisons?
[3:54:27] d2darkalliance: @towelliee What would player house be different to garnison?
[3:54:29] ZomgItsZero: just make it like FF14 and hope for the RPers to return danKEK2
[3:54:30] jmalmin: If you look at ESO. Housing is one of the more popular things in that game.
[3:54:33] xxsargexx: @Krajn look above towelliee's cam....
[3:54:34] SpilledMelk: Ff14 got housing right.
[3:54:37] Ilibrit: make a pool that resets cooldowns
[3:54:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, housing done well is something that a lot of players might want to do, to a degree
[3:54:47] Shadowlemur01: if they dont give me housing i will cry
[3:54:49] desmo7: garrisons were a test for housing and it didnt pass
[3:54:50] Mozzeyy_: @Towelliee do u know how long the opening ceremony is?
[3:54:54] mutant21: Goldberg confirmed for WoW
[3:54:56] Krajn: @xxsargexx oh lol sry tired after work :D
[3:54:57] Rodenbo: it's just not a thing for wow, people bring it up every single blizzcon and every single expansion. it's just not going to be a thing
[3:54:58] Nachozdood: lol they will talk about it in the Q&A
[3:54:59] neftario105: Housing be cool
[3:55:02] Nirland1: well our housing was left back in WoD and that was kinda sad that they didnt keep it going as back then it was a big topic back then
[3:55:03] Ezmaraldaa: ESO housing is super imo
[3:55:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: they still owe us a dance studio
[3:55:06] xxsargexx: i miss Wildstar for its housing the most
[3:55:09] Alisera: i hope they address it
[3:55:09] MILESkg21: @mutant21  LuL
[3:55:11] gyrojoep: Housing with a bank and mailbox.
[3:55:13] foshanks: WoD was housing
[3:55:15] Stealinheals: i mean the garrison was kinda that wasn't it?
[3:55:17] Ryuenjin: I'm still waiting for the dance studio
[3:55:20] Kriven: @foshanks stop it
[3:55:20] Mister_Ript: Garrisons just need to be repurposed into Guild Halls.  But, they've said multiple times they're never going to implement player housing
[3:55:21] dmaa17: they tried with garrisons though
[3:55:21] xziyn: No housing confirmed
[3:55:23] UltraKSlaya: if that leak is real, it is coming
[3:55:25] earlg3: how do folks differentiate housing from garrisons
[3:55:26] Shadowlemur01: I still sit in my garrison most of the time
[3:55:26] Straatos: i mean why? it would make cities emptier than they already are
[3:55:29] byrdeen45: its needed
[3:55:31] brentosxd: ppl would just get PTSD from garrisons
[3:55:32] NVbrutal: they already said housing isnt something thats gonna just happen it will take multiple expacs of working on it to do it if they was going to.
[3:55:32] SpilledMelk: They trade with garrisons and failed miserably
[3:55:38] Nachozdood: MoP Farm <3 BiS house wow has had
[3:55:38] Dreamerstream: they do as little as possible to hold the cost down, and earn as much money as possible.
[3:55:39] Maydie6066: We gave you player housing so you can sit in your virtual house while sitting in your real house doing house stuff
[3:55:40] SoryinTK: its not about what they want it should be about what we want as a comunity
[3:55:42] applefactory: Class halls on the other hand...
[3:55:42] ididntdoitfr: Pretty much every MMO that comes out now it's to be expected, tbh give us a system like garrison back
[3:55:42] Xkevmoneyx: Wow needs doors
[3:55:42] Stealinheals: repurpose garrisons and make class halls relevant
[3:55:42] Hypertitan: its a pretty decent horizontal progression that would be pretty heavily used by a wide array of players
[3:55:47] applefactory: bring them back by all means
[3:55:47] foshanks: Next WoW Xpac = What Sword, shhh
[3:55:48] Rodenbo: @gyrojoep we already have an area that has auction house and mailbox, it's called the capital city
[3:55:52] Sicknessqt: They probably wont do housing cus of garrisons faillure KEKW ptsd
[3:56:03] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @marshallx (warning)
[3:56:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Housing is like PvP content or raid content, not everyone does it but a substantial part of the players would like it
[3:56:03] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:56:06] Dorky1495: Blizz said a long time ago they would rather not have things like Garrisons, where players are zoned away from other players (in there own personal zone)
[3:56:07] Rodenbo: there isn't anything for them to do with housing
[3:56:08] bohdichitta: Housing is a great gold sink and could really get crafters more involved...making housing items
[3:56:08] SamuraiWillZ916: people will expect things to be inthere thart currently require you to go out in the world i dont think they want people staying in their house
[3:56:11] Irahh: can't aoe them
[3:56:14] TheRonWeedsley: mechanic hard
[3:56:19] Sicknessqt: Make class order halls relevant again please
[3:56:19] StrangerXs: aoe does kill mirrors

[3:56:36] leeysttv: housing needs to be like pet battles. optional
[3:56:44] Stealinheals: instanced home in the capitol cities that you can decorate is that what ppl want?
[3:56:44] Ryuenjin: @bohdichitta Scribes making wallpaper, leatherworkers making chairs and rugs
[3:56:44] Alisera: no min/max housing please lol
[3:56:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: first hour of world first race they are decorating their house
[3:56:46] mcdranki: Hey chat, does anyone know if you still have to buy a virtual ticket for blizzcon?
[3:56:50] Rictamar: housing would be awesome, a nice evergreen feature that people could do in their spare time, collect things for it, crafter involvement etc
[3:56:54] Rictamar: would be sweet
[3:56:56] laarrryy: Is housing a leek? Or we just speculating
[3:56:57] Mister_Ript: Garrisons should be converted to Guild Halls.
[3:56:57] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:57:05] eldritchcoffee: kill the last mythic raid boss, get a couch for your house!
[3:57:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah garrisons were not all bad, they had fun and useful stuff
[3:57:13] shtboxd: 2 hours HYPE
[3:57:15] Sarcastard: The codeing to carry over housing to FUTURE expansions is ALOT of Work...
[3:57:19] Neowanderer: garrisons did work for my gold count
[3:57:19] Nation_HQ: i thought you went to blizzcon?
[3:57:21] cripplious: I loved the farm in MOP
[3:57:26] TurtleThumbWar: I've been thinking - with this awesome plater setup, is the target health bar necessary? I might delete it on my setup.
[3:57:29] Rodenbo: housing is also a thing they would have to keep relevant forever, because if it's good and we like it, we'll hate it when they get rid of it
[3:57:30] XugieXugo: @desmo7 Issue with the garrison was it had a way to get an AH and no one left, leaving major cities dead. Even if they did player housing and didn't give us a way to have our own AH would still not work due to the AH mount which a lot more people have then most think. There are other reason for the garrison but that was one of them.
[3:57:31] eyekahnography: garrisons would have been cool if we had customization control over the look, where the properties go, and stuff.
[3:57:37] limburgse: Wait what?!? You banned on Retail??
[3:57:37] Brodih_: you hit the overlay button @Towelliee
[3:57:37] Sylphy_TV: LUL
[3:57:38] applefactory: Garrisons took you out of the game world though. It was the opposite of what an MMO is supposed to do imo.
[3:57:41] MILESkg21: monkaS  are they watching now ??
[3:57:45] MattJ063: HE KNOWS
[3:57:46] halnoth: I think part of the problem with Garrisons is they didn't really have a main city in WoD, Ashran wasn't on par with Shatt or Dalaran
[3:57:47] Aquadriel: worse than pyromancer
[3:57:48] Ribastur0075: do you actually know what is gonna happen?
[3:57:53] Ellycat1: Did you get followed home? danS
[3:57:56] Angelraven13: üòÜ
[3:57:56] PotbellyGoat: we need speculation bingo

[3:58:00] mavericks312: Did they take your ohone
[3:58:06] CloudPants8081: amiloSmoke no leaks around Kappa
[3:58:09] ididntdoitfr: Towelliee is the Edward Snowden of Blizzard Kappa
[3:58:18] Zapp_Brannigan86: When you scan your pass to get in, alarms go off in the PR department at blizz
[3:58:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: did you make a bingo card?
[3:58:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Insider access pog
[3:58:20] Djfarmville: @desmo7 yeah the major flaw with garrisons was the abandonment of hubs LUL
[3:58:27] Xailen: Housing should replace heirloom gear with current and old set bonuses, but cover everything old content for any level character. And be a nice place to show off collections.
[3:58:27] blade_killa: LUL

[4:02:35] smashwow: baj getting toned as fuck. that dude always looks good when he sheds the fat
[4:02:39] PokerFaceMoose: @TweektheProphet dont think that will happen
[4:02:40] Collected1: Sco still looks great
[4:02:42] DraulTheVikingFox: I heard a neat idea but doubt it would happen. Them using bronze aspect or COT to connect Classic and Retail. Allowing a jump back and forth in time. and them adding new content to both but in different time lines/games.
[4:02:47] Bearded_Axe: @towelliee Maybe WoW will come to Xbox now
[4:02:48] mavericks312: Between sonii,Knut, and baj probably the 3 biggest dudes there
[4:02:50] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee why does Baj stream on YouTube

[4:04:24] shtboxd: If they introduce something amazing for classic then retail will be getting something better because they wouldn‚Äôt want to kill LIVE with something insanely good for classic.
[4:04:28] chaotikz7: Cant wait for ff14 exp
[4:04:28] CatsRusOfficial: But if the next expansion is a september. That is 10 months of the new raid. Would they do that?
[4:04:32] DraulTheVikingFox: I really like their content types athey have added into Dragonflight.
[4:04:39] ethanolenthusiast: !drops

[4:05:40] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Rodenbo

[4:05:48] mavericks312: Sloot and casual don‚Äôt mix lol

[4:09:31] LeneMarie: Asmon said that last time he travelled his dad got caught in a snowstorm and lost power and got a tree across his driveway so he couldn't get out either. So only thanks to friends did his dad not have to sit in the cold. After that he doesn't really like travelling @Towelliee

[4:10:57] dwolters_the_zombieman: all the mounts in the game will now be available in the store lol
[4:10:59] Rodenbo: @Towelliee my theory is classic gets it's own line of expansions after wrath
[4:11:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: clicks
[4:11:06] Bearded_Axe: If WoW dropped on Game Pass, would it be Game Over?
[4:11:14] Xsidious: Blizzard bring back hots? Kappa

[4:11:20] rhodistar: @frenzoll They took a photo as well :D
[4:11:20] Nerendis: Oh no it's not a feud. It's just a meme I keep running with.
[4:11:23] Aidler: And I like the picture with Belluar only because Towelliee was in it too
[4:11:24] Erielle04: The wow leak spreadsheet is up to 106 KEKW
[4:11:29] Collected1: "Towelliee lets it slip"
[4:11:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: controversy = cash
[4:11:33] mavericks312: If WoW dropped on gamepass they would lose millions
[4:11:34] Rulem: @big_beef he lives close and will go after the opening ceremony
[4:11:35] Nirland1: aka the moudi and Mrgm fude about content

[4:11:59] LeneMarie: I can imagine Panda can lay down a few laws, but I don't foresee Bellular ever punching.. anything =) Not that Panda would either mind =)

[4:13:52] Aidler: I don‚Äôt know Belluar as a person but I definitely dislike his work ethics
[4:14:08] Bearded_Axe: I wonder what D4 is releasing.
[4:14:09] Rulem: I hope not
[4:14:10] Rodenbo: oh that's an actual public theory, is that "classic+"?
[4:14:16] mavericks312: Classic is getting there own xpac cata classic lol
[4:14:19] Ellycat1: Original theory do not steal danKappa
[4:14:20] applefactory: @Aidler work ethic? Guy works super hard. You mean his takes?
[4:14:24] odriscoll1234: Bellenduar
[4:14:27] NickLeonhearth: My theory is classic aint getting new content :D
[4:14:27] DeanoTV: Classic has an expac..BC..
[4:14:29] vic_ave: @Towelliee  check the tier vendor in the blacksmith shop
[4:14:30] Valseki: @Rodenbo yea
[4:14:36] tiejuandoemaster: I wish I could get that dragon from the dragonflight dungeons as a mount. the crystalized one
[4:14:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think any additions to Classic would have to be small at first, like the seasons were
[4:14:56] Bearded_Axe: Hearthstone is still kicking it.
[4:15:08] Ant9912: Togc tier can be bought with Triumphs
[4:15:11] sprert: 232 t9 is buyable for emblems
[4:15:14] Ant9912: but i think its only 232 or somethin
[4:15:18] biirrd: you get first with Triumphs
[4:15:20] UltraKSlaya: it is going to be cata classic
[4:15:21] Aidler: @dregsbenedict_  goes hand in hands somehow. Working very hard to produce bad takes
[4:15:25] Bearded_Axe: Is Overwatch done yet? üòÜ
[4:15:26] NickLeonhearth: ppl dreaming about paladins getting taunt, new zones and quests....like what are you smoking
[4:15:29] NickLeonhearth: get me some of that
[4:15:29] Rodenbo: look at @Towelliee trying to downplay it, he knows
[4:15:32] borgmanson: Check Sidereal Essence vendor
[4:15:34] mavericks312: You can‚Äôt give classic new content and not give it to retail
[4:15:37] Caveamatrix: @Towelliee surprised you're not at Blizzcon.
[4:15:38] azzurrin: New content for classic is bascially another MMORPG they have to develop for
[4:15:39] Valseki: I just want progression servers with monthly expac releases and buffed xp / drop rate
[4:15:43] Xsidious: Star craft 3? Heros of the storm making a come back?
[4:15:44] tiejuandoemaster: theyre gonna release a new cow level for diablo
[4:15:46] TurtleThumbWar: Maybe they announce a separate twitch channel for hardcore/retail lol
[4:15:47] Rulem: Yeah, I don't like the idea of new content for classic, unless it has absolutely no connection to the story
[4:15:48] notColt45: ppl expectations can get out of wack
[4:15:52] TweektheProphet: Ok time for a 40min power nap before blizcon starts , see you in a bit towellie and chat
[4:15:55] azzurrin: They won't be developing for two MMOs
[4:16:00] Kinghorn: he knows!
[4:16:01] warlor503: as much as people shit on blizzard the blizzcon hype is always fun
[4:16:05] Rodenbo: he just wants us to be shocked rather than "we already knew that"
[4:16:07] so_much_this: Honestly viewing classic as a different game than retail I‚Äôd be fine with new content for classic
[4:16:10] so_much_this: No memea
[4:16:11] jd_aftermath: classic+ is  a pipe dream and everyone is going to be angry

[4:16:17] so_much_this: Memes
[4:16:18] jonnyblaze2006: Keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.
[4:16:25] Kinghorn: reddit said classic+
[4:16:30] Raszun_: Would love a full overhaul to HotS
[4:16:30] Sambhur: !rumble

[4:16:55] Ellycat1: I can't believe we still don't have the confirmed and promised tinker Kappa
[4:16:55] trivotix: Do you guys not have phones?
[4:16:56] Asuo_: WoW players are like girlfriends who get mad at you for what you did in their dream LUL
[4:17:01] Kinghorn: LUL SinicalDev
[4:17:04] Rodenbo: I also think retail will be getting at least 2 more supports and support will be it's own role with 6 people in dungeons
[4:17:05] jd_aftermath: it would be cool, but no reason for bliiizz to put dev time on that
[4:17:05] Kinghorn: chest
[4:17:12] sliproach: @Towelliee i remember when you said you were going to pay my wow sub for ever  Kappa

[4:17:47] Grue_Feathermoon: schizophrenia-game = schizophrenia-players
[4:17:54] darkrowse21: i wanna see a evil turkey king dungeon boss for thanksgiving drops turkey mount and maybe a cosmetic outfit too
[4:17:54] ograamora: World Of Warcraft Harbinger 0.0
[4:17:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: That hardcore tournament brought huge viewership
[4:18:03] blade_killa: true
[4:18:06] bohdichitta: that mak'gora tournament this week was crazy
[4:18:08] mohappyy: do you have plans for 10.2, will you push mythic+
[4:18:11] invasiveTV: pretty true
[4:18:14] Rulem: HC is fun side content, but not a primary game imo
[4:18:26] JasperXIII: 300k
[4:18:50] avashil: Are there drops?

[4:19:31] Sylphy_TV: zekeYAY woooo drps baby
[4:19:41] vulkankragon: i don't understand why classic gets so many views all the time compared to retail. i mean the content is 20 years old at this point.

[4:20:09] mavericks312: Classic hardcore has viewers because they wanna see ppl die
[4:20:10] Broomba: AH is for everyone in Dalaran
[4:20:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Throne and Liberty next year could be big fun
[4:20:35] Rulem: Will you play Tarisland?
[4:20:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Broomba not on classic
[4:20:51] MILESkg21: Blue Prot looks fun too bad its a wallet emptier LuL
[4:21:02] mavericks312: Isn‚Äôt tarisland just the wish version wow?
[4:21:02] Aidler: 2023 was pretty crazy as well
[4:21:04] Zedar_Frost: Can I just say that Gargoyle is disgustingly powerful in PVP in Rumble? god damn it keeps soloing the end tower by itself and my enemy can't do anything to stop it
[4:21:09] DraulTheVikingFox: need to be on that Quantum Knights and First Descendants
[4:21:10] Bowwjack: @Broomba @Towelliee on wrath classic the AH is for only Engineers

[4:22:24] MILESkg21: @hollowedlyfe sup :)
[4:22:25] mohappyy: i thought too that it's going to die in first weeks, but it's just going on
[4:22:26] dguap: if peeing your pants is cool, call me Miles Davis
[4:22:28] Ellycat1: The last bit of the race does have that hype
[4:22:31] rymerre: im tired of watching the same teams do the same shit
[4:22:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just wait for the clip of the final kill
[4:22:33] TurtleThumbWar: I enjoy watching people actually level characters
[4:22:41] Aidler: even people who don‚Äôt know what WoW is watch hardcore to see people die and rage of course
[4:22:51] king_waltzy: add death limits to lockouts for mythic first few weeks
[4:22:55] MILESkg21: 30 minutes black temple LuL
[4:22:57] applefactory: Jailer race was uncomfortable to watch tbh
[4:23:04] UltraKSlaya: I said tarisland looks good and I got timed out?
[4:23:06] hollowedlyfe: btw Miles this is Junkrat 2nd account
[4:23:06] odriscoll1234: i enjoy the raid prep
[4:23:22] Rodenbo: death limits would just make the leaving problem even worse
[4:23:32] Dazdari: probably time for a new PvE game mode. I miss some of the PvE solo challenges. Visions if they kept scaling would have been great (and also if you didn't HAVE to grind them for gear.)
[4:23:34] questy90: wow tcg pls
[4:23:34] Mendo_ksi: imo what's ruining more the fun is this timegap drama we have evry RWF. Top guild should really figure this out... Common raid time is not that complicated imo
[4:23:36] Rulem: They had that for MoP, right? The secret boss
[4:23:38] ohnot___her: Hoping for some sort of borrowed power for 11.0
[4:23:41] MILESkg21: @UltraKSlaya  cuz "P2W" is blacklisted here :)
[4:23:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: a friend of mine that never played wow only knows about 2 things from wow, leroy jenkins and the funeral raid in winterspring
[4:23:45] michaelmm: I'm impressed we're this close and Blizz have managed to not accidentally leak something about 11.0 yet themselves!
[4:23:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: @UltraKSlaya Moobot catches certain phrases, it got me one time too
[4:24:08] UltraKSlaya: oh, I was saying it is not that lol
[4:24:31] Kainiee: @michaelmm they did leak the preorder mounts
[4:24:33] Rodenbo: @michaelmm well blizzard has microsoft money to threaten in their NDA's now yea?
[4:24:36] Fleymour: is the react streamer giveaway from blizzard for wow streamers or all streamers ? echoesportHmm
[4:24:49] Eshel: Good morning everyone - happy Blizzcon day !!
[4:25:08] mohappyy: wow is so huge thing, developers are just getting better at it, we are now seeing the process of big things being created
[4:25:09] MILESkg21: wtf is that KEKW
[4:25:14] Mendo_ksi: Honestly i can show you a schedule with common raid time between EU and NA on live servers that imo could really work
[4:25:17] Naturalbeef: The RWF is just fine as it is
[4:25:19] Buckwink: you have to be good at faking excitement
[4:25:20] Lokajin: You already know asmongold will win the react streamer award
[4:25:20] sythica: Whats crazy is WoW isnt even designed for hardcore yet it works
[4:25:20] sinlesssinner: not complicated really, just release the raid worldwide. like the expac release
[4:25:21] WhyBloodie: People making up give aways now
[4:25:21] mavericks312: There is no clear cut answer for the RwF problem
[4:25:23] LeneMarie: what react streamer are they giving away? cohhLUL
[4:25:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: godzilla had a stroke and died reading that comment
[4:25:38] vulkankragon: so considering the popularity of hardcore wasn't it a bad idea to cancel that dark souls style diablo game?
[4:25:39] neverbornlucky: Toweliee you sell your soul
[4:25:39] Kinghorn: I will take 1 guzu please guzuHead
[4:25:42] MILESkg21: godzilla OMEGALUL
[4:25:43] Gravefire: The good ones.
[4:25:44] michaelmm: @Rodenbo Usually the BNet Store or their web folks leak something unintentionally. I mean the Dragonflight name was revealed by the Store the weekend before they annunced it.
[4:25:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm a fan of global releases, yeah
[4:25:54] AnimalCrackers_19: No IRL stream at the con?
[4:26:08] Kinghorn: he is heading to the con after the opening ceremonies
[4:26:09] TheZIXIS: TheZIXIS subscribed with Prime. 
[4:26:12] ArcaneSyntax: Doing rwf on a tournament realm is like doing the makgora tournament on a tournament realm.
[4:26:20] Eshel: I‚Äôm sure this has been asked - but what‚Äôs the opening theory on xpac release timeframe - mid-late next year?
[4:26:35] Rulem: GW2 manages to not have any downtime ever
[4:26:40] Hawke_89: is this live or a pre-rec?
[4:26:47] Kinghorn: 3 reset days with asia in the mix
[4:26:47] MILESkg21: probably the usual Fall Term next year

[4:26:59] Kinghorn: NA EU and asia have different reset days
[4:27:03] H0bbitK1ng: it favors whoever doesnt have to change their sleep schedule. no way around it.  there will always be something to complain about.  not to mention you are alienating half your audience that way (not everyone can wake up and watch at midnight)
[4:27:06] Jinx1348: 1 hour and 30 min, hurry the f**k up (rocking foreward and backwards) .....
[4:27:08] captain_khyzan: meh.... its literally 1-2 week problem for less than 300 ppl out of the 2mil average. def a non issue
[4:27:18] delaine: @Hawke_89 live
[4:27:27] Eshel: That‚Äôs what was thinking too - but that timeline gives us a long fated patch no?
[4:27:37] Ellycat1: Releasing right now! danKappa
[4:27:38] Rodenbo: are we in the 90% of the fact that we're even getting an expansion in 2024?
[4:27:39] michaelmm: Was it legion they gave the actual month of the release?
[4:27:44] mizerboy: @Towelliee  - you think the new expansion will launch before end of summer 2024?
[4:27:50] mavericks312: Wasn‚Äôt the last September release MoP?

[4:28:31] Rodenbo: are we in the camp of new expansion being "most likely 2024" or 2025?
[4:28:44] Mendo_ksi: No need for tourny realm. Long story sholt the only thing they have to do is NA side wait 13h after reset to play and Eu side stop playing 11h before next reset. And they can have common raid hours. It will be during the night for the most part but i mean i think it's worth it
