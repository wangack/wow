[2:19:45] TheCliffyShow: Sounds interesting.
[2:19:47] Mcaffee: what addon is that?
[2:20:00] Armdel: it seemed similar to how FFXIV does it where theres crafting gear that you wanna wear while doing the crafting
[2:20:02] Syn1189: I was pretty excited for new world crafting but then it just became craft 100k gloves
[2:20:09] Rohen86: 5 player content where all need to be a skinner to skin 1 badass mob would be cool

[3:22:37] theDirtyon3: it comes from the chats 100%
[3:22:55] xaeblue: they need to agree to stop abusing WA and other addons
[3:22:56] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  maybe because they have been together raiding for like 10 years?
[3:22:58] raye_gaming22: max shitalking echo on stream is one of the reasons

[5:17:23] SeedySandwich: I liked highmaul a lot
[5:17:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: by that logic with server que's then that means Endwalker was a flop LUL
[5:17:29] Masqerader: how can there be server issues with a dead game as every chicken little tweets or post on youtube lol
[5:17:36] Finansdepartementet: Bad launch and bad expansion are two different things

[5:18:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: We're going to be posting in the forums about the beta every day to make sure it's as good as possible
[5:18:54] smashwow: if they get the balancing right, and nail the other things. i agree. it's a layup of an expansion and the win we all need @Towelliee we're due
