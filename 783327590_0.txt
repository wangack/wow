[0:16:37] BowSec: 1-0 to gattz

[0:17:26] TweakT: it’s like buying an iphone 12, you know you want one, but there’s just nothing new compared to your old samsung galaxy s7
[0:17:26] DrezbistTv: baha "NEW" content is something new. Content is whats in the game.
[0:17:39] ZyntosAran: @mmrghost7 no, thats "new content", not "content"
[0:17:41] TheUnknowing: content isn't something new, content is the CONTENTS of the game, there is 15 years of it, you just dont want to do most of it
[0:17:45] mmrghost7: ik
[0:17:48] BowSec: all these people with 100% acheivos, collected all the mounts... wow

[0:21:44] ZyntosAran: @Wrenton eh, yeah, they would never ever do something like that
[0:21:45] stressley89: SL 2021 for sure
[0:22:06] swordart_19: Isn't Blizzard like under fire now?
[0:22:14] stressley89: yup
[0:22:18] swordart_19: *in fire
[0:22:19] MrGattz: for what?
[0:22:19] TweakT: maybe they delay expac cause gpu’s got delayed 5Head
[0:22:35] kranztheman: @tyrex_10 It has dropped twice since the hallows end event. Both time, to other members of my group and not me. very disappointing.
[0:22:37] swordart_19: I have heard there is big fire near
[0:22:47] Eshel: Blizz hq was fine last I checked .... but some devs are under evacuation
[0:22:52] ToxicFalloutVGX: under, on, in... Just a bunch of fire in general
[0:23:01] Collected1: I wonder if that would have delayed a launch last night
[0:23:03] ZyntosAran: @swordart_19 yeah, but basically all of blizzard is working from home anyway. But there are some devs being evacuated.
[0:23:15] striker_2kuk: i thought the xpansion was out toda
[0:23:16] swordart_19: @tweakt gpu got delayed?
[0:23:19] MrGattz: im sure everything is fine
[0:23:26] Collected1: striker_2kuk : nah delayed until later this year
[0:23:36] striker_2kuk: @Collected1 ahh thanks
[0:23:39] Wrenton: @zyntosaran oh so the current state of the gamw and beta RIGHT NOW is good for release and completely balanced.. is that correct?
[0:23:42] AudioKat: yea actually two close fires one in Yorba Linda, and in Irvine. could hardly breath without coughing yesterday
[0:23:45] TweakT: well, nobody has rtx 3000 gpu’s in their rig @swordart_19 or not enough
[0:24:08] swordart_19: @tweakt They don't exist
[0:24:19] iuvenis: Kappa
[0:24:24] ZyntosAran: @Wrenton that was a joke, because it already got delayed. beta right now is broken
[0:24:35] TweakT: everything is delayed, except my secretlabs chair, was expected to ship on 18th nov. but I got a mail yday they shipped yday xD
[0:24:48] swordart_19: @wrenton balance is same as in lol.
[0:25:12] TheUnknowing: PogChamp @TweakT
[0:25:17] ZyntosAran: @Wrenton and balance is an ongoing thing anyway. Wow will never be balanced

[0:27:31] Collected1: nah it's a green bag you're right
[0:27:41] Wrenton: @zyntosaran I thinj it can be balanced... I think its just people complaining too much when their favorite classes get nerfed or a Blizzard refuses to nerf a class they like
[0:27:47] Wrenton: think*
[0:27:48] ijuki: @TweakT How about no on that

[0:28:44] swordart_19: @wrenton you are right with that case pvp meta same for decade

[0:29:06] big_pacc: @Puntagious93 is it? I thought it was only obtainable at lvl50, mb

[0:30:15] MrGattz: although...
[0:30:18] Puntagious93: @zsuzsndr well I’m farming it on several 45’s, and the reward is the epic pumpkin bag. Not sure if there’s a certain tweak or limitation to the things the bag drops
[0:30:20] MrGattz: lore was in the channel yesterday
[0:30:21] DrezbistTv: Will it be the EVENT you are looking for?...probably not
[0:30:25] Nostredame89: yeah I was considering the chance cause of the long maintenance but if the reset didn't even happen yet sorry for my question
[0:30:29] TheUnknowing: its blizzard, remember to keep your expectations low! lol

[1:14:09] DeadlyDag: @aeroplax The upside with having a job and playing as a hobby is that you're almost always looking forward to what you enjoy (gaming wow in this instance), while if you're unemployed / have a lot of time to play it, you'll most likely get tired of it and ruin the experience after a while (unless you get paid to play it;) )

[1:31:42] ResidentMadman: @Towelliee Ding i have now leveled everyrace to 50 :D

[1:41:54] LycraTv: actually recently Hasan and Xqc has the most popular clips on both Youtube and Twitch
[1:42:09] Cynocles: Twitch should do what facebook did instead of being pussies :)
[1:42:14] MOXP: monkaS
[1:42:21] thebakeriscomingforu: Once the those companies and lawyers notice, you are screwed
[1:42:25] CADZtv: fortnite success and blow up deffo escalated it i think
[1:42:35] othraerir: you can;t even play music you "own" on cds/dvds
[1:42:48] Jawdane3D: @othraerir ofc not you dont own it :D
[1:42:55] purfessorplum: the sad thing is if people weren't playing clips of songs sooo many of those artists would just fade into oblivion and no one would ever be like "ooo what song is that" and potentially got buy it etc.
[1:42:55] suzuya1189: No
[1:42:56] Thunderbrew: Simple solution, just play the in game music until they tell you can't do that.
[1:43:01] suzuya1189: He saved it all
[1:43:01] eziz86: Not yet release ?
[1:43:04] just_laxus: i miss the old simple days of limewire when nobody gave a shit
[1:43:11] admiralRipsnarl: it not broadcast it
[1:43:11] ZyntosAran: @ezizq8i what is?
[1:43:19] Collected1: that GTA clip better be saved
[1:43:19] xPapio: i would imagine most of swifty's best memories are on his youtube already
[1:43:26] MisterBongwater: In game music is no guarantee that gets muted too
[1:43:27] masho95: @reallaxus Metallica cared.

[1:44:10] MOXP: LOL yeah panglish
[1:44:12] Vosy1984: because of the metal music he is playing on Mondays
[1:44:12] Malarick: so you wont be able to run re-runs then unless you are sure there is no banned music
[1:44:18] Mascolino: And he has even been using DMCA free music recently too
[1:44:20] DreamSweet: Yea panda plays a lot of music
[1:44:26] eziz86: @zyntosaran shadowland not yet
[1:44:33] ICJSI: @Towelliee think scourge invasion today?
[1:44:33] KorbenDallas815: SHOULD
[1:44:47] x_united_x: DMCA is so outdated
[1:44:47] ZyntosAran: @ezizq8i we dont have a release date yet
[1:44:53] Staksor: @Vosy1984 he made sure it's ok to play that music. he's fine
[1:44:56] purfessorplum: I think the RIAA/Record Labels mislead lost revenue due to people using those songs, when push comes to shove people will just stop using the songs and they still won't have any new revenue.
[1:45:01] KorbenDallas815: then there's somehow that half second that counts and comes back to bite you in the ass PepeHands
[1:45:04] Cynocles: Wait at least an hour or 2 before checking the vVOD, as the processing can take a while
[1:45:08] BearOfLight: Blame Disney
[1:45:18] 2MakeMe: what flavor we vaping today?
[1:45:22] Thoreya: did anyone watch sodapoppins project 30 tthing last night that shit was hilarious
[1:45:24] maddhatterr: Twitch algorythm picks up about 10% of DMCA coverd material, so even if you think youre safe, I wouldnt count on it
[1:45:33] Vosy1984: Staksor yes, I know that
[1:45:36] MisterBongwater: I don’t play much outside music but I got stuff like fall guys and no mans sky muted good times
[1:45:38] Oriion_: Yeah Walt Disney fucked it
[1:45:43] AgentWhiskeyy: What addon makes your buttons look the way they do? Is it quartz or bartender

[1:45:58] Xpress1: @Towelliee Dansgaming deleted 10 years worth of vods straight up, its actually sad
[1:45:59] Cynocles: most of the people who didnt get a DMCA email have there VOD's locked behind subscriptions
[1:46:03] Archmoose: What addon do you use to see all the treasures?
[1:46:06] FatChase: I think more people discover new music through streams than anything
[1:46:06] Mascolino: I remember doing this without flying
[1:46:06] maddhatterr: @DoloZplash 50
[1:46:07] thebakeriscomingforu: USA doesn't really have laws for the internet. We need some younger representation in congress. Then we can update them and have internet classified as a utility
[1:46:31] Motivess: The arguement for DCMA makes some valid points though, protecting artists and record companies should be important, the problem is when they abuse it
[1:46:35] Vosy1984: nah, most of those labels are from US @Towelliee
[1:46:46] othraerir: and they think they are losing sales, lol
[1:46:50] NBK_Sethus: greedy pieces of shit shooting themselves in the foot again
[1:46:59] Aegeanm: Hey Towelliee! Is there a way I can learn whıch addons you use?
[1:47:00] Unrealsiege: Tbh twitch/amazon should just fing pay them for you to play what ever you want

[1:47:18] BigBiffyB: What's funny is I've bought music because I heard it on a twitch stream lmao, before Covid there are bands I went and saw live because I discovered them via a streamer
[1:47:21] PatrickKaneIsGoat: @Collected1 you cant be punished for playing covers
[1:47:27] Aidler: and Bezos responded by bying them all

[1:47:34] Rakim88: bezos is cheap LUL
[1:47:36] WookieWeener: My suggestion is that if you want to listen to music with the stream. They can join discord and listen through your spotify with you to what song youre listening to at the same time if they have premium.
[1:47:36] Wulfgrym: Twitch should create a music library for streaming
[1:47:38] Zettabyte: multi dollar industry
[1:47:39] BigBiffyB: There are bands I would have never heard of if not for a streamer
[1:47:39] xPapio: 1 million lazers
[1:47:40] x_united_x: I’m surprised twitch can’t hide behind amazon music some how. Like all streams would be good if they use amazon music
[1:47:40] ネオラッド: twitch priority is to make money, why would they spend more LULW
[1:47:46] thebakeriscomingforu: Amazon just buys some music companies
[1:47:49] Brodih_: I actually discovered some bands because of streamers playing songs that I liked and did not know

[1:47:55] Carlenzo: that was age off ultron
[1:47:56] Ezekyler: Age of Ultron
[1:48:02] Ezekyler: the fight vs Hulk
[1:48:08] Suntati: @x_united_x you can use amazon music with an extension

[1:49:13] KorbenDallas815: forsen is MEANT to have about 2 as well and WAS meant to have 'earned' a couple more last time during the last scare but didn't get any @Crazdmadman and was probably already meant to get his 3rd and didn't have anything happen to him then
[1:49:17] ネオラッド: dmca is the same on other platforms too though

[2:53:28] toxicmammoth: they wont miss out on christmas because anyone that wants it will still want it even if its after christmas. People will buy the preorder as a gift.
[2:53:30] papaPathos: nah, the decision is still out there because they actually are still crunching. I am sure they have a couple of slots they are eyeing and are just waiting to see how these few lasts sprints turn out before they make a call.

[2:54:56] spushs: Is the leveling fixed? Last week, zones were still phasing to dailies and dropping 60s on my head.
[2:54:58] papaPathos: Shadowlands will not launch "perfect". that's not what blizz is going for either. they just want to make sure their first impression is as good as possible.
[2:55:00] SmokedHog: people ust want to be against blizz

[2:58:07] GorSTL: because he's taking money from his label, basically?
[2:58:10] SubQ: those execs are trying to hold onto their multi dollars.

[2:59:44] wallermd: @Revanite20 Thats just dumb kek, why wouldnt you own your own music, too much bs
[2:59:46] JonVonZombie: facebook gaming did some kind of deal they allow you to play music
[2:59:49] Drakenking: Thats what you sign away with a label
[2:59:50] Erielle04: in the end it all comes down to money again
[2:59:57] BoiAtomico: Holy smokes, people are getting banned on Twitch for playing their own musics? That's insanity!
[3:00:00] LeagueofDevack: This beta or WoD?

[3:00:56] Colly_UK: but wasnt this the same argument with gta
[3:00:59] wallermd: @TheStankyBeard ik but for cases like this is bs, you should have rights on at least a certain % of the job so this shit doesnt happen
[3:00:59] Colly_UK: and that seems fine
[3:00:59] McStuber: if ya dont mind , what is the add on on the top left that you are using?

[3:01:28] McStuber: @Keklemor ty
[3:01:32] Drakenking: @swordart_19 Generally they do remove it with DMCA unless its on an official channel, some labels will enforce it more then others
[3:01:33] rbailey_2222: rbailey_2222 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[3:01:33] Breet: if it's licenced in the game it should be fine? (like gta?) but who knows if that changes later

[3:01:37] Wulfgrym: lol we think
[3:01:37] Steppie: @Towelliee Nah Cyberpunk is fine, they tweeted Dan and they said it was fine
[3:01:37] LoneRangers: @Towelliee a streamer got banned because he was playing COD and they added music when you drive the vehicles and he was driving one around .
[3:01:42] RazorKameo: "should" monkaS
[3:01:43] Shrenko: all music in Cyberpunk is licensed. They allready told us @Towelliee
[3:01:43] carlos9949: cyberpunk > wow
[3:01:43] BoiAtomico: @Towelliee Gotta mute everything on stream from the looks of it. Even your own voice isn't safe!
[3:01:44] Klauzzer: DansGame
[3:01:44] the_bad_goat: This year sucks. I swear people getting too sue happy
[3:01:47] Danculus: towYar
[3:01:47] Shrenko: its made by them @Towelliee
[3:01:47] get_bent009: I think the cyberpunk music is all going to be original songs by the artists, no existing songs
[3:01:48] Murry07: Díky za KPOPTT @rbailey_2222
[3:01:49] GorSTL: they tweeted out that the music in the game was done just for the game
[3:01:50] admiralRipsnarl: Dansgame
[3:01:51] pews_s: Don't forget the Halloween Bonfire 10% EXP Buff @Towelliee
[3:01:52] Flanageddon: the only game I play as much as WoW is GTA and all of that music will get hit
[3:01:53] Steppie: @Towelliee They said it was all original in house music
[3:01:53] Murlock07: Should be isn't the right answer
[3:01:57] duhworks: you can't play the music and mixer at the time canceled out sound for most sports games @Towelliee
[3:01:57] papaPathos: imagine cp releases and no streamer with a brain cant stream it xD
[3:01:58] pereadin: when its a legal issue its a "Yes or No" answer not "Maybe/Should be"
[3:01:59] WoW_StandalonE: its OK, maybe Kappa
[3:02:00] MadHatt0r: "am I good?" - "you think you are, but you arent"
[3:02:02] Shallo1988: so if we pay for a spotify account I dont understand why we cant use the service. like the artists are getting paid?
[3:02:06] Tzarvahl: @wallermd band's have to negotiate for that in their contracts, its unfortunate but that's how contracts work. hopefully bands stop going to publishers and start self publishing to get shit to change
[3:02:07] NewWorldReign: Twitch is gonna have a lot of lawsuits over this DMCA shit.
[3:02:08] spushs: @towelliee The only time I can see that as relevant is storyline games. I mean if people see the story there is no reason to play it, in theory.
[3:02:09] Shrenko: but they allready told us its good @Towelliee
[3:02:10] Kromede: be sure to get a written official permission
[3:02:11] Arhell: IMAGINE KEKW
[3:02:16] maddhatterr: Didnt CDP Red come out and say Cyberpunk is safe for streamers - they made all their music in house, not outsourced
[3:02:18] iioanin: is this draenor?
[3:02:22] pk99: won't have to imagine soon KEKW
[3:02:23] TMMOOF: @Shallo1988 good point
[3:02:26] Colly_UK: when will we see streamers DMCAing other streamers for watching there videos live...looking at you asmon
[3:02:28] Drakenking: @maddhatterr correct they had their own band come in
[3:02:28] brozzy: Cyber punk was all in house and the rights owners are cdprojeckt
[3:02:30] Colly_UK: it will happen i promise
[3:02:31] skratchh: Companies are starting to change their tune towards streamers
[3:02:33] De_ke1zer: gg
[3:02:35] Azphelle: Having to get permission from your publisher to play your own music...
[3:02:36] No_Panda: i have haloween buf at garrison
[3:02:38] Glenfy: @Towelliee they said the Cyberpunk music was made from scratch for the game and is safe
[3:02:53] swordart_19: IN BEFORE REVENUE GOES DOWN FROM THESE DMCA guys and GOING UP FOR NO COPY RIGHT RADIOS
[3:02:54] SmokedHog: typically when you buy music for a game you buy the rights to that music
[3:02:56] Ootapwn: labels and companies think that people dont go buy/listen to the music they here. its basically ads
[3:03:00] PToastman: If they own the rights they should be able to give a yes or no answer
[3:03:03] Wulfgrym: unless twitch starts to buy licenses to play music or the games do, streamers are fucked
[3:03:04] spushs: On the other side games like among us and fall guys got popular because of streaming.
[3:03:04] Ootapwn: hear*
[3:03:06] LeagueofDevack: @Towelliee , the MPAA and related groups need to back the fuck off.
[3:03:08] Thoreya: Tru
[3:03:10] Shrenko: CDPROSJECTRED
[3:03:11] Shrenko: YES
[3:03:12] Drakenking: ??? The tracks are licensed soundtrack, and yes
[3:03:14] ShadoodHD: but that doesnt mean anything to publishers who are releasing the games KEKW
[3:03:16] SmokedHog: they buy the rights do the songs
[3:03:19] CertifiableAndy: Wonder if Mike Shinoda will get DMCAd
[3:03:19] JVegas: thats insane

[3:03:21] RazorKameo: didnt they make it all in house?
[3:03:22] Shallo1988: @towelliee do you know why we cant use spotify if we pay for it?
[3:03:23] sphynx_13: They are the owners of the music
[3:03:27] Drakenking: CDPROJKET owns the rights
[3:03:27] GorSTL: CDPR owns the music
[3:03:28] Galadeon: Bam, eMac from Activision for playing their I game music on your stream.
[3:03:30] Armdel: stream everything muted mic only from now on
[3:03:30] papaPathos: who represents those artists is not relevant. what is relevant who owns the rights to the music they produced. and if CDPR can confirm they *own* these rights you are good.
[3:03:32] MrBurtyyy: Release date today maybe? Or nah?
[3:03:38] Shrenko: they are
[3:03:41] thebakeriscomingforu: I think streamers and their representation will probably need to get specific permission for it. Notify Twitch, and then flags the channel as being compliant.
[3:03:45] ShadoodHD: welcome to the wild wild west Keepo
[3:03:48] thebakeriscomingforu: Which is all a pain
[3:03:49] Otschboh: @Towelliee Nightmode made music for them POGGERS
[3:03:54] Colly_UK: YOU NEED A UNION
[3:03:56] Huntmaster_Bara: I woudl nto put it past CDPR to make sure that happens.
[3:04:03] SmokedHog: like you said it's a good point, you need to confirm with a lawyer if that is true before even streaming it LUL
[3:04:05] thebakeriscomingforu: Although you'd be completely clear
[3:04:05] Wulfgrym: great way to bet someones business
[3:04:07] Azphelle: Twitch Uwunion

[3:04:14] Sprucemoose: which MIGHT be today with the long ass maintenance
[3:04:14] jason_tacey: GM everyone and @Towelliee
[3:04:25] TheBeardedSpider: CDPR holds the licenses to the music the same as it did to Witcher 3.
[3:04:30] pereadin: I hope it is today even if they don't release a date. Just somethiing new and fun to do will be great. The scourage iinvasion was fun af to test.
[3:04:31] Kromede: blizzard staff watching now: "ups we forgot the invasion"
[3:04:32] Whoopszz: GA!
[3:04:38] falldrgn: Most musicians don't own the rights to their own music. The record company owns it. for example Michael Jacks bought the Beatles catalog .. and taylor swift sued someone for the rights to hers
[3:04:39] Marshfield: Anything can hanppen?
[3:04:44] BigfishboyOG: Are they gonna make it so you cant see ie Nike symbol or Adidas symbol on your clothes on Stream?
[3:04:47] spushs: The music streaming service should have a higher priced streaming option that allows streamers to use approved music where they can get the proper permissions and associated revenue.
[3:04:58] ScufJumpn: so what you are saying is there is a CHANCE it could be today?
[3:05:02] Rane_Tehp: Good morning everyone!
[3:05:03] Galadeon: You guys heard it. Towel confirms scourge invasion today and release date announcement
[3:05:04] Klauzzer: scourge invasion is going to be pog
[3:05:12] sir_valorum: !interface
[3:05:12] Kromede: an invasion should allways happen by surprise
[3:05:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: getting hyped for no reason at all is what we do best Kappa
[3:05:14] Arhell: it would be nice, but kida hard :(
[3:05:17] SmokedHog: isn't there a spotify app you can login and listen to your own music while the person streams
[3:05:20] Tzarvahl: I think twitch/amazon will end up integrating prime music into streams, so streamers and viewers can sync their music together. i know it doesnt fix games, but it'll solve some of it

[3:05:46] Marshfield: Blue Balls For Everyone!!!
[3:05:47] Sprucemoose: I've missed every scourge invasion so it's still gonna be cool for me
[3:05:47] DigitalChill: Pussified LUL
[3:05:50] Sovekz: I was watching Dropped Frames, they had Mike Shinoda there, he talked how he can't play Linkin Park music on his stream, was kinda funny
[3:05:51] jaykodiak: does the gear catchup come with the scourge invasion?
[3:05:53] CipansR_Ayaya: for them kids bro
[3:05:54] TheGaoSora: you mean they removed the griffing and made it playable
[3:05:55] Klauzzer: pussified lol
[3:05:55] Murlock07: thanks the complainers
[3:05:55] CertifiableAndy: Scourge invasion will be nice for my fresh 50 40 ilvl characters
[3:05:59] givmeafrekinname: Did they reduce the respawn timer of the rares for the Scourge Event? I remember Towelliee saying they had like a 30 min respawn timer a while back?
[3:06:02] Nesrath: Is it going to give amazing XP like the legion invasions?
[3:06:07] Drakenking: gachiBASS explode
[3:06:08] mojusk: scourge invasion with safe spaces for special snowflakes
[3:06:12] ShadoodHD: rip zombie invasion FeelsBadMan

[3:06:17] smrfish: i do that in rl
[3:06:33] Bossk_XD: cause people cried about the event during ptr

[3:22:59] dym_jt: @Towelliee even sites like MMO-C posted guides on how to do it when the game time had 50% off, and basically you could unlock all the rewards for the price of a store mounts or so. (game timed time gained from RaF also accounted for)
[3:23:03] Brodih_: spriest is much complex than fury tbh
[3:23:06] Drakenking: @drc54 rest assured whatever you heard about retail in classic is a little bit skewed lol, i think Shadowlands will be good
[3:23:08] tehrobtar: lol @Towelliee the only thing i can think of rn with your title is the old publishers clearing house commercials... where they were like... "anything can happen.. could happen to youuuuu.. publisher's clearing house.. the house where dreeaaammmss cooomme tureeeee" xDDD

[4:00:34] Rakim88: rams destroyed the bears
[4:00:35] Veritis: ^Rams lel
[4:00:39] upinurguts: Legion Invasion Prelaunch went from Aug 9 to the 30th when Legion Launched
[4:00:39] Vertonic: @Towelliee what covenant for monks you think?
[4:00:43] Erthelmi: Nagy is a trash playcaller
[4:00:47] LoseAlotLuke: you hear OBJ got ACL injury @Towelliee
[4:00:48] upinurguts: so like 21 days
[4:00:49] Rakim88: tell that to jason Kappa
[4:00:50] noChance219: FeelsBadMan Da Bears
[4:00:51] Korrupters: nfc west is an insane division
[4:00:53] BaldPanda360: yeah.. they should go back to trubisky
[4:00:53] beefyboi22: FeelsBadMan as a bears fan, tell me about it
[4:00:54] LegoCoin: 10 - 24
[4:00:56] Foxdoabarrelrofl: bears were the worst 5-1 team ive ever seen
[4:00:56] Erthelmi: offense genius scoring less than 2TD in most games
[4:00:57] dozilla: Nick Foles has looked awesome dude, last night they were outplayed
[4:00:57] BoofinZ: nick fols is hot GARBOO
[4:00:58] Spiritfield: @AveragePvp I hope so. It's hard to learn more about it, but without spoiling too much.
[4:00:58] sacredrabbit: The QB has never been the answer for the bears
[4:00:59] mrzombiebull: HEs a good backup but can't be a consistent starter
[4:01:06] Foxdoabarrelrofl: and this is coming off the 49ers killing the rams
[4:01:12] LegoCoin: but now tied up 5-2 both
[4:01:13] hanzoisback: do you share your elvui profile @Towelliee
[4:01:20] Chimp458: time to clean house yet again
[4:01:21] th30dor: Fowles KEKW
[4:01:27] BaldPanda360: if they do that, you CANT let Foles know thats the plan
[4:01:28] beefyboi22: @Towelliee The offense is so bad, we're ruining a potential all time defense
[4:01:35] dozilla: Not sure why all the hate on Nick, must be jealous of his third leg
[4:01:37] Cyntech89: Wildcat with Foles behind center and Trubisky lined up next to him
[4:01:40] Cyntech89: Keep the defense guessing
[4:01:41] Spiritfield: excuse me what was is that little thing? o.o
[4:01:41] Rictamar: and Miami killed the 49ers the other week, the league is nuts
[4:01:43] DarthWrex: Did you see the quadruple doink?
[4:01:47] Raw_Doggin: @towelliee they should go after jameis Winston
[4:01:56] xXSiebzehnXx: DAYUM SON
[4:01:58] Mitune: When is the next Lego build?
[4:02:02] xXSiebzehnXx: hit em with the 24 points
[4:02:05] Erthelmi: 24points and Rams average starting was something like their own 40 or soemthing
[4:02:09] noChance219: How can the Bears NEVER get a "good" QB. Harbaugh was probably the best QB I remember. McMahon was just clutch for a few seasons.
[4:02:12] Sionz: overrated
[4:02:14] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 1065 units were placed on the battlefield.
[4:02:16] StateFarm206: Anyone got a good game to play right now ?
[4:02:18] Cyntech89: He should be the starter for the Saints Kappa
[4:02:20] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Gylduran to be fair the 49ers have like 20 players on IR lmao
[4:02:20] Ratchet_N_Crank: @Towelliee what do u get from doing this tower of the damned
[4:02:22] Chimp458: pace nagy all the qbs .. half the receivers ... oh I may need therapist time
[4:02:23] beefyboi22: @Towelliee Because they were on the field so much, I mean like last few years they've been top 5
[4:02:24] 2ooq: He chose to go to New Orleans wtf
[4:02:25] damrets: Hi, I’ve been wondering if I should main WW or feral, what is your opinion regarding both classes ? Thanksss
[4:02:28] RocketMan23: 30 interceptions is absurd lol
[4:02:28] CodyDaBrodie: Winston is the best backup qb right now for sure
[4:02:32] yeaahyeah: Bears have no RB
[4:02:33] Rakim88: 30ints bad Kappa u dont say
[4:02:34] 2ooq: who wouldnt want to learn from Brees?
[4:02:36] CodyDaBrodie: well i guess Fitzpatrick is now
[4:02:38] trrow96: would you wanna see something like mage tower in shadowlands

[4:02:50] rigitywrecked11: Cam Newton going to be a backup QB soon
[4:02:56] beefyboi22: NO LUL
[4:03:03] upinurguts: @damfer03 WW over Feral as Feral representation is 26th DPS overall, bottom of the barrell
[4:03:03] the_chadillac: Fitzpatrick should go to Dallas
[4:03:04] Gpar: He’s working with Brees and Sean Payton. He’s gonna be good in the coming years
[4:03:06] Got2bekidding: and he isn't jameis squintston anymore
[4:03:09] Korrupters: andy dalton OMEGALUL
[4:03:10] Rictamar: Fitzmagic is the best backup right now
[4:03:13] Burnski: @mrzombiebull as a Packers fan, ya'll keep him!
[4:03:14] xXSiebzehnXx: @Foxdoabarrelrofl Some teams do that when their seasons dont start so well to prevent injuries to players they exaggerate injuries and buff IR
[4:03:17] MN_Generic: man gets a fat ass check for playing like shit living the dream
[4:03:17] noChance219: @Motivess FeelsBadMan Imagine if they had a good QB with some of the Defenses they've fronted
[4:03:29] ninedraft317: The bears have no o line
[4:03:33] dozilla: Nick has a great arm, can't deny that
[4:03:39] dozilla: needs a right system
[4:03:40] Erthelmi: Bears O-line is trash and you can't have a statue sitting back there
[4:03:48] Wesley1213: @Towelliee Did you see DK Metcaff rundown that int. that was insane
[4:03:52] baja6133: Matt Nagy is a shit play caller...end of story
[4:03:55] WinkingSkull: I'll take a backup who can win over a guy like Matt Ryan
[4:03:56] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @xXSiebzehnXx maybe this year due to short term covid IR, but in normal seasons if you go to IR you dont come back. If that was true they wouldnt be able to field a team this year haha

[4:04:09] gladdyy: @dozilla he's been in plently of systems...don't think that's the issue lol
[4:04:10] manmower: those bears didn't seem quite as good as we thought
[4:04:14] AveragePvp: Bro I really can’t stand Brett kern the titans new kicker, idc if he was solid for the patriots choked against the Steelers and thankfully we carried him in the broncos game. He’s just so inconsistent it’s scary
[4:04:15] Gpar: “I don’t mind getting payed bank, saving my body and then coming in to throw a few TDS and win a Super Bowl”
[4:04:16] dozilla: @capricore BS, Eagles had that game regardless
[4:04:27] TheDuck0nQuack: bears either need an actual O-line, or a QB that can move around in the pocket

[5:00:29] jure__: each square is one item
[5:00:30] spookaninja_21: Vault = win
[5:00:31] Alzar_tv: @NiLLx_ It's based on the lowest key level of the highest 10 runs you've done in a week
[5:00:31] Esnuker1: it is better than what we have
[5:00:31] GoIden_: So I cant get a pvp chest and a mythic+ now? so instead of 2 pieces we get 1?
[5:00:32] zuuta19: mizkifEgg
[5:00:33] von_highland: You can choose 1 of max 9
[5:00:34] chubby_ch4ser: yeah now thats a nice system! i like that
[5:00:34] theSalute: all belts n boots

[5:00:46] Aidler: If LFR doesn't count I'm screwed towLul
[5:00:50] hevska: @towelliee when does the expac launch??
[5:00:51] swordart_19: They made it so PEOPLE DO RAID KEKW
[5:00:54] MOLAR305: i thought it was 1 per row
[5:01:00] pereadin: Now is their item levels all equiivalent? @Towelliee that's extremely important as well
[5:01:01] jure__: @Aidler it does, but the ilvl from it is gonna be low
[5:01:03] Alienfromger: LFR does not count???
[5:01:07] RealZedz: if i do 10 +2s will i get the same ilvl as 10 +15s
[5:01:10] Vile_: @swordart_19 People already do the raids...?
[5:01:10] swordart_19: Since people in Pug Nythria etc just go for 1 boss instea leave , this will make people stay and get boss count .
[5:01:12] Annyongg: Did the patch drop yet?
[5:01:12] Tox1cThoughts: @SubQ :D
[5:01:15] Drakenking: @swordart_19 you mean do the only thing I care about in the game
[5:01:15] sLogOG: now people will cry "my 2 bis gear dropped but i can only choose one, wtf is this system" KEKW
[5:01:16] swordwindgaming: man thats designed to eat days out of my week lol
[5:01:16] swordart_19: @Vile_ you dont play
[5:01:22] Tenatia: @RealZedz No
[5:01:25] leave_tv: Really wish the update came out on my bday today
[5:01:27] Drakenking: if they removed m+ today it would be perfect fine for me
[5:01:27] swordart_19: @Vile_ people go for 1 boxx kill bye leave insta
[5:01:31] roflpotamus: so for first few weeks, it will be pvp chest? since no raid/m+ @Towelliee
[5:01:31] Ratchet_N_Crank: u can open that vault and get loot per toon? or is it account wide?
[5:01:33] totallypayingattention: so you see what is in there to pick from?
[5:01:33] TryAtomic: That is q u a l i t y
[5:01:35] ElanJacobBarnhart: hello im new. but i wanna kno does xpack come out?
[5:01:38] doomkry: @Drakenking why?
[5:01:38] recsgaming: lfr counts but the ilvl you get in the item will be lower if you did for example 10 heroic bosses
[5:01:41] mrpresbaby: is it really 10 15s you have to complete to get max choices?
[5:01:42] MILESkg21: leave_tv Happy Birthday FeelsBirthdayMan
[5:01:42] StarzkynHutch: arnt the servers down
[5:01:48] Aidler: @jure__ no problem. it's the best I can get and then SL is finished for me
[5:01:48] sbrice87: @Aidler Lfr does not count. Only normal,heroic,mythic
[5:01:49] hevska: @towelliee DO U KNOW WHEN THE EXPAC LAUNCHES???
[5:01:50] dengueuk: @ElanJacobBarnhart no one knows yet
[5:01:50] TuffnSnuff: :)
[5:01:51] calilito: No doing 10 +2 will not be the same as 10 +15, you will get loot closeer to +2 ilvl
[5:01:51] stonix69: When the servers back up i wanna play wow lol
[5:01:53] MetallicusGaming: StarzkynHutch yes
[5:01:55] Vile_: @swordart_19 I'm talking in general -- not on the beta. It will be different once everyone is playing, more people will be clearing the raids fully.
[5:01:56] swordart_19: Kinda made raids only gear reward KEKW
[5:01:56] Default22: so basicallly you wont feel crippled if you choose to just pve or just pvp which is sick.
[5:01:59] Heatinup: 2 for 5$ what a deal!
[5:02:01] mrniceguy817: What determines the ilvl of the loot to choose from
[5:02:02] von_highland: It encourage people to play its totally fair
[5:02:06] RealZedz: so if i want to do lfr for xmog, itll fuck me when it comes to do my chest at the week ? @Towelliee
[5:02:06] burnow: did you just go to lightspeed?
[5:02:11] mmrghost7: 5 K VIEW what's happening
[5:02:19] Jahknowme: people still salty and shadowlands is looking to be one of the better expansions
[5:02:23] tubbyrhino: at worst it's exactly the same as weekly chest has been so you're not losing out anywhere
[5:02:24] NoMashMe: woah did they pull the tera flying portal thing lol
[5:02:25] Barkerisonfire: People acting like this isn't better than the RNG chest we have now for being forced to do M+ LUL
[5:02:25] Kleimz: @Towelliee but most people will feel theyll fall behind if they dont do all of it for 9 pcs
[5:02:26] thickthighs91: @mmrghost7 pre asmon viewers
[5:02:28] StarzkynHutch: is this a private server?
[5:02:31] arrantSagacity: Can Shadowlands legendaries be disenchanted / scrapped to reclaim the dust so you can craft a different one?
[5:02:32] Bacon_21: @MilesKG21 it's your burfday? richkidPog FeelsBirthdayMan Kappa
[5:02:35] stonix69: yes asmonbald
[5:02:35] TweakT: Lightspeed Magic
[5:02:36] Drakenking: @tables118 Because its boring and pointless, the mechanics are generally simple and most high end mythic dungeon bosses difficulty comes from binary situations
[5:02:36] Stonefather: Ludacris speed danS
[5:02:37] MetallicusGaming: StarzkynHutch this is beta
[5:02:39] Shrenko: @StarzkynHutch FailFish
[5:02:40] swordart_19: @Vile_ that is general did you do raids recently ? why would bobby wanted to kill 5 bosses when he needs item from 1 ?
[5:02:45] LegoCoin: I am from the future and were waiting on Shadowlands LUL
[5:02:47] hyde_meow: so now can we level to 60?
[5:02:47] spookaninja_21: Can someone post the wowhead link on the vault?
[5:02:49] StarzkynHutch: i just got here guys
[5:02:50] ThorH13: THEY WENT PLAID
[5:02:51] Gelskor: asmonStare
[5:02:51] arron_one: What beta server are you playing on could help with that dungeon
[5:02:52] MILESkg21: Bacon_21 SURE Kappa
[5:02:55] swordart_19: @Vile_ bobby kills 1 and lleaves.
[5:02:58] hevska: @towelliee can someone plz tell me when the expac launches?
[5:03:00] MetallicusGaming: ckontroll no this is beta
[5:03:02] Aidler: @sbrice87 then no vault for me I guess
[5:03:05] chubby_ch4ser: Pre asmon spergs!
[5:03:05] hyde_meow: okayu
[5:03:05] ElanJacobBarnhart: is shadowlands drop today?
[5:03:07] dengueuk: @ckontroll no max is 50
[5:03:07] Ratchet_N_Crank: what is the sl legendary?
[5:03:07] LegoCoin: M+ is going to be great in Shadowlands
[5:03:08] MetallicusGaming: hevska nobody knows
[5:03:11] Vile_: @swordart_19 Because guilds often do content together as a group and want to clear the whole thing, in a general sense.
[5:03:12] sath_81: what is that morg your running man
[5:03:14] doomkry: i mean for casuals it wont mean much since they will can only do one weekly 15 to get one piece as well so need to time it anyway
[5:03:19] dengueuk: 60 in sl
[5:03:22] branTVx: @Towelliee do you lean more preheet or preheat?
[5:03:24] Vile_: @swordart_19 I'm not talking about Bobby, I'm talking about on the whole.
[5:03:32] RealZedz: thats so dumb, if i want to do +2s for dungeon mounts or something i dont want it to affect my weekly chest when i also do 15s @Towelliee
[5:03:35] DarkenedHour97: what do the pathfinder reqirments look like?
[5:03:41] Reathyr: Mr. Towelliee ahead warpfactor 5, engage
[5:03:42] Endofdreams: @Towelliee YES
[5:03:44] LegoCoin: yes
[5:03:45] Endofdreams: @Towelliee big nerf
[5:03:56] GoIden_: @RealZedz im sure it wil take your top 10
[5:04:00] hevska: @towelliee WHEN DOES THE EXPAC LAUNCH????

[5:04:13] ZyntosAran: @hevska WE DONT KNOW
[5:04:14] KuromiBlackheart: @hevska don't know
[5:04:15] malburt: the first m+ vault is just the highest key youve done that week, the next m+ option is you have to complete 5 keys to access it, of those 5 your lowest key will be the gear so if you did 4 10s and 1 - 2 the gear in that spot would be ilvl for a 2
[5:04:15] Kinghorn: yes they did
[5:04:16] swordart_19: @Vile_ i am talking about whole too 4Head same as pvp only reason to do it was to put it behind weekly chest KEKW
[5:04:18] SweetPickles24: why is there a penis behind you
[5:04:20] MetallicusGaming: @hevska NOBODO KNOWS jeez

[5:06:39] swordart_19: @Vile_ iif it was not true they would not put boss kills behind it from raids since people were just joining and killing 1 specific boss since rest of loot was crap for them same with pvp.
[5:06:41] AstroStoleMars: @Zzorex just wondering first time playing wow and didnt realize it was going to happen :( I am addicted lol

[5:13:31] mmrghost7: when "iti's ready"
[5:13:31] davidnewski: @kokholder why bringing politic into this convo lol

[5:14:34] Windnecro: they might not nerf the leggo they might end up nerfing one of the other windfury multipliers.
[5:14:56] AgentWhiskeyy: when does this maintenance over?
[5:14:56] Uther_The_Lightbringer: @kokholder they will just refund evryone
[5:15:00] admiraltegetthoff: is there catch up available today? scourge invasions anything? or will that come later this year xd
[5:15:08] Secondbreakfasttt: did they fix the mage or his it's about the player who is playing mage
[5:15:10] flo_406: They aint gunna nerf it, it just looked busted cause of how short that fight was
[5:15:10] purfessorplum: any holy pallies here know if they are truly planning on any viable ranged options? or mostly pigeon holed into melee dps healer?

[5:16:14] AlienTongue: @Eveloire just because it was used before doesnt mean its a good idea what kind of logic is that? we went from being able to cast what ability we wanted into being holed into spamming wrath then spamming starfire rinse and repeat

[5:25:11] ZyntosAran: @hevska later this year
[5:25:11] pist0lpete129: well Ice Lance is usually top dps because its the main ability from proccs. that does seem broken tho
[5:25:12] WesJM: @Towelliee how are the different tank specs? I tanked on all classes but haven't done it since Cataclysm and really want to get back into it.
[5:25:13] Vigi9413: he must be wearing his sprite fairy mog to get +15% dps
[5:25:20] hevska: @matrix_17 so it 100% won’t come out today?

[5:25:59] Steelen: How long is the DT for? I didnt look... Doubt we will get any news in regards to prepatch event
[5:25:59] BramishEU: id like to see timewalkimg raids, make older raids relevant again
[5:26:00] haderdaraide: Are servers still down?
[5:26:04] AlienTongue: they will announce when it comes out
[5:26:11] Heatinup: no blessed hammer anymore?
[5:26:21] the_chadillac: towVACBOSS
[5:26:23] Shrenko: is bnet still down for you?
[5:26:27] Vigi9413: Bolvar's hammer in game was pretty badass
[5:26:28] pist0lpete129: no 202 0blizzcon... sadface
[5:26:29] Cafe0le: next year they need to announce a new expansion LUL
[5:26:29] TheCliffyShow: That hammer is sick. And it was a girl who made it. Lich Queen confirmed!
[5:26:32] Poriand: @bramisheu time walking raids would be cool!
[5:26:42] foxies_havocing: people have hard time going over their nostalgia, just get over it
[5:26:47] CipansR_Ayaya: It wont work
[5:26:53] NispyCriblet: timewalking would still be cool
[5:26:56] Vigi9413: it's in the past for a reason
[5:26:57] casualboomer: Give me timegated, timewalking raids at max level to get mounts back to 100% drop rate like Invincible
[5:27:02] derry10: re-vamp the old raid gear so they don't look like low rez gear
[5:27:03] MrTerkyMan: Modernized versions of old tier sets would be cool
[5:27:07] fleesyo: What if they had a weekly progress bar to do old content that gave you xmogs/pets/mounts?
[5:27:11] Hielloz: we are in the era of recycling content, rip all the new gens not gettin much new content
[5:27:12] MrTerkyMan: appearances that is
[5:27:12] branTVx: @Towelliee hey tow! im thinking of trying some tanking since ive played dps since 2004, which tanks would you suggest trying for someone new to tanking? gonna level in dungeons prolly if queues are fast
[5:27:13] NispyCriblet: YES^^
[5:27:14] Motivess: It would too easy, people would know how to beat the bosses
[5:27:16] Lycam: What about timewalking LFR?
[5:27:17] Vigi9413: Like this Project 30 stuff.... Just let it go guys
[5:27:18] Broomba: its like project 30 or 60 to redo content that is not relevant
[5:27:18] Drakenking: Think about all the trinkets to balance
[5:27:23] Drakenking: alone
[5:27:23] kaykayowned: nah make it about 15 ilvls lower then u dont have that issue
[5:27:24] DeadlyDag: The timwealking-raids works fine. There's tons of them up when it's available, but as long as you can't actually gear in it, and you only gain transmog, achievements, pets and mounts. (Like it is now), it's fine.
[5:27:24] TheKingOfWit: I think the timewalking lvling system is the best mix. you can still experience old content
[5:27:28] swordart_19: OLD raids are relevant just do transmog runs 4Head
[5:27:30] FireNubbi: i like farming that transmog solo ^^ noneed to bwl scaled uo
[5:27:31] Poriand: LFR time walking raids
[5:27:31] pist0lpete129: yea
[5:27:32] NispyCriblet: No
[5:27:32] dannyis1337: think the need to do timewalking M+
[5:27:38] crawcook: I think what Soda did is the ebst you can do.
[5:27:45] Meechl: if timewalking was equal to current, people would just pick the easiest raid from the last 15 years and spam it...
[5:27:50] devildriver1919: timewalking challenge modes...lets go
[5:27:51] crawcook: Maybe Blizzard could change a few small things.
[5:27:54] casualboomer: @Towelliee how about bring back things like MSV and ICC with 100% mount drop rates again, but done at current heroic raid difficulty?
[5:28:00] Coriollis: timewalking raids are terible there is no threat mechanics , no resistances required is just a zerg fest
[5:28:06] pist0lpete129: face it, people wouldnt do them often enough for it to be worth the money spent on the development
[5:28:06] BramishEU: I think a lot of old content is wasted, they dont have to give current lvl gear, but there has to be a way to make them interesting once scaled up
[5:28:07] Vigi9413: all these projects are just grasping for nostalgia
[5:28:08] consta322: What came first Ulduar or ICC?
[5:28:15] creazyTV: They shoud simply add timewalking-raids to the raid finder.. I still dont know how to find a timewalking-raid :/
[5:28:15] swordart_19: big TRUE 4Head
[5:28:15] Steelen: The old shit, should be just that. Old shit.
[5:28:16] futomara01: uld
[5:28:16] Nalyiun: Ulduar
[5:28:18] skysinge: @ct_reap Ulduar
[5:28:18] DeadlyDag: @casualboomer How about no.
[5:28:19] TweakT: they should honestly just remove the heroic/normal lfr difficulties
[5:28:19] MILESkg21: Timewalking MC event went horrible
[5:28:20] doomkry: @Towelliee imagine scaled DBW
[5:28:20] ohTsias: ulduar
[5:28:21] Skullgrinx: Time for WoWII
[5:28:22] TheKingOfWit: meechl is right, people would find the 1 easiest raid and the all content other than that raid would die
[5:28:22] dym_jt: I hope they pick Firelands for Cata TW.
[5:28:25] MOXP: true bring always new, not working shit and brute-force it on players :)
[5:28:26] maxon1969: give it em straight towel
[5:28:31] Syllvn: @TweakT are you high? xD

[5:28:52] Coriollis: classic tbc and wotlk :)
[5:28:53] casualboomer: @DeadlyDag you realize some of that old content, some people literally never got a swipe at, right? It's a 16 year old game. There are players today that weren't even born when BC dropped
[5:28:55] theSalute: itch it

[5:28:59] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee Nostalgia is what people are after. and nostalgia is nothing if you try to restore it... thats what makes it nostalgia.
[5:29:00] MILESkg21: DeadlyDag people still didnt understand the 1 mechanic 15 years later LUL
[5:29:01] pdcgaming2: please tell bliz to bring back thunderfury weapon proc as an enchant in shadowlands
[5:29:02] Caanan20: Blackrock Foundry and Hellfire Citadell would be fun too I enjoyed those raids
[5:29:02] swordart_19: Sodapopping doing Project 30 can do same for all rest raids , they are scaled and working
[5:29:02] FireNubbi: bfa classic confirmed D:
[5:29:03] GrazzloTV: Waiting for WoD servers
[5:29:04] Vigi9413: You think they'll keep Classic and TBC Classic seperate?
[5:29:08] swordart_19: *Sodapoppin
[5:29:10] Neruan: pug animus POGGERS
[5:29:11] ReinholdtRanger: @Towelliee Have you seen that funny "leak" about the state of the showlands date and event etc
[5:29:11] creazyTV: so would be awesome if someone can explain me how to find a timewalking-raid when timewalking is up
[5:29:15] branTVx: @Towelliee hey tow! im thinking of trying some tanking since ive played dps since 2004, which tanks would you suggest trying for someone new to tanking? gonna level in dungeons prolly if queues are fast
[5:29:25] NilocAfterDark: well see ya in 10 years for classic legion
[5:29:26] swordart_19: Lock your level to 30 or what and go do it 4Head like Sodapopin
[5:29:26] FrozenMustage: hi everyone
[5:29:27] DeadlyDag: @MilesKG21 ah, thought you meant that it was bad. because I loved it. even though it took a while since we had to explain a lot to 'new' players :p
[5:29:30] pdcgaming2: thunderfury wep proc is still the coolest proc ever. we need it as an enchant or at least a transmog
[5:29:30] lazy__medic: cant wait for classic bfa in 2035
[5:29:32] ezebrooks: Yo towel man do you think if I’m a player who hasn’t touched the beta and isn’t familiar with how the maw and torghast works we will struggle in the beginning of shadowlands
[5:29:33] nothumbgamer_ttv: if wow classic ever releases mop I won't ever be on retail again xD
[5:29:40] eric__tyler: They could totally scale players down to old dungeon/raid levels via LFG/LFR. It wouldn't be that big of a deal. Blizzard has already done similar things.
[5:29:40] dannyis1337: classic BFA Kappa
[5:29:42] GongshowRS: warrior is a wipe fest
[5:29:46] calcutr0n: BC baby!!
[5:29:46] sbdcodex: @Towelliee how's blood dk looking in SL
[5:29:49] FryeTV: WoW classic mop = BIS
[5:29:52] Bayless_TV: Yeah
[5:29:53] NispyCriblet: Yes
[5:29:53] Samaellus: I kinda liked sunwell daylies :D @Towelliee
[5:29:54] Drakenking: Yes but they banned a few OP specs
[5:29:56] frostfirefox_: @ezebrooks you'll be fine
[5:29:57] Coriollis: tbh people are having fun in legion like Dalaran is kinda crowded and alot of people do invasions and wq content evan after full lvl 50
[5:29:58] Drakenking: like Fury and Arcane
[5:29:59] pdcgaming2: thunderfury weapon proc as enchant
[5:30:03] Vigi9413: MoP was good good until you stayed on Timeless Isle forever
[5:30:04] swordart_19: Yesterday OBS +3 6 hours PROGRESS
[5:30:07] doomkry: @EcrirTwyLar problem is balancing scaled gear from old raids
[5:30:07] swordart_19: WAS towPog
[5:30:08] calcutr0n: @Samaellus dude i LOVED SWP
[5:30:13] TheKingOfWit: @creazyTV search pre-mades for group. then leader queues at the npc
[5:30:15] tomcruise210: im stoked for tbc classic
[5:30:19] Cox_The_Gemini: man that shit had me crying luaghing it was pretty funny though
[5:30:20] hunterxp: yeah i feel the same way tbh
[5:30:21] DeadlyDag: @casualboomer assuming you're talking about the old raids. brining it back in timewalking, sure. same mount as the mounts (invincible for example) with 100% drop? hard no. If they reskinned it, sure. Collectors would be so mad.
[5:30:26] Drakenking: Watching them progress on OS3D was pretty hilarious though
[5:30:26] sixRlNGS_: Is wow down?
[5:30:27] TweakT: I love it VapeNation
[5:30:27] annefrankseyebrows: Ban specs lol?
[5:30:34] annefrankseyebrows: What's the point
[5:30:35] TweakT: private servers were fun af for vanilla
[5:30:38] xViewersunitedx: how are you guys playing with the servers down?
[5:30:40] Stonefather: That's exactly what they are doing
[5:30:44] sixRlNGS_: Is he on classic?
[5:30:45] BramishEU: i wouldnt make current raids irrelevent, the same that timewalking dungeons dont make current irrelevent
[5:30:45] Drakenking: They arent going that hard into it, Project 30 is mostly for memes and Fury is just straight up BROKEN from 2 weapon procs
[5:30:46] branTVx: @Drakenking fury OP at 30 rly?
[5:30:49] MrGattz: @xViewersunitedx streamer servers
[5:30:53] pist0lpete129: Beta @xViewersunitedx
[5:30:55] thickthighs91: LOL
[5:30:55] Coldbloodedtedi: @Towelliee can we get a close up of the look your currently wearing ingame?
[5:30:56] nothumbgamer_ttv: @xviewersunitedx beta :)
[5:30:57] redtemplar88: Their were OP specs back then too soo
[5:30:58] hunterxp: Lol
[5:31:00] muertomans: because retails going so well lmao
[5:31:00] dpbdagger: It looked super fun last night honestly
[5:31:00] xViewersunitedx: oh
[5:31:02] LordKain73: Classic... KEKW
[5:31:03] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Thats like you want to travel 1000 miles from home and have a car but you say "No i will walk there" Kappa
[5:31:04] Drakenking: @socks_05 yes heavily
[5:31:11] Nalleys: Wtb Classic WoD with no gold income nerfs, and ability to buy WoW Tokens
[5:31:13] Drakenking: carried by 2 weapon procs
[5:31:13] branTVx: @Drakenking how comw?
[5:31:14] Coldbloodedtedi: noice.
[5:31:17] Coriollis: classic became terrible after phase 2 and the classic andies wanted no changes so here we are
[5:31:19] 13lade1: lol retails boring too
[5:31:19] Skullgrinx: same
[5:31:20] okNate: yeah them dropping classic on the 1.12 patch... this was bound to happen on it.
[5:31:20] SilkeySmooth: retail is not that good
[5:31:22] eric__tyler: @tables118 It's really not that big of a deal. They've already done similar mechanics. It's just whether or not they want to.
[5:31:22] s_t_o_r_m__: I'm leveling too
[5:31:24] Shrenko: @mcgrillidan it is tho
[5:31:25] twowheelsonelife: I love retail
[5:31:26] TMMOOF: I collected flying in each xpac, guess what I was told... Tough luck :P @DeadlyDag
[5:31:27] Kinghorn: that is all there is to do is level characters
[5:31:28] ohTsias: yup
[5:31:28] pist0lpete129: 38/50 almost there!!
[5:31:29] Kinghorn: LUL
[5:31:30] swordart_19: @mcgrillidan just look into wow setion what do you see KEKW
[5:31:30] casualboomer: @DeadlyDag if it's at current-content level of Heroic raid? Give a shot to a lot of players that never got them while also giving it some actual challenge? Why not? Give me one good reason to deny new players a shot at old content at actual difficulty other than "they weren't there when it was current"
[5:31:33] muertomans: yeah all i do is leveling now :(
[5:31:33] Spartyy_: the WoW community is never happy with anything so
[5:31:34] TheCliffyShow: On Stream Raiders there's a pineapple with pizza.
[5:31:36] twowheelsonelife: twowheelsonelife subscribed with Prime. 
[5:31:37] Redreka: just like people having fun in classic? lol
[5:31:38] tempore420: its all old players tho, no new players
[5:31:38] SilkeySmooth: because there is nothing to do in retail
[5:31:40] Jawdane3D: retail is unironically more entertaining than classic
[5:31:41] ohTsias: i just started after 7years
[5:31:42] muffinborg: Leveling in retail is fun again
[5:31:43] ronnir51: broken shore is filled with people getting their mounts
[5:31:44] Vigi9413: And then they wipe on Sartharion forever, I don't see the fun in that
[5:31:45] Exodeo_: I'm enjoying tbc lvling atm
[5:31:47] thebakeriscomingforu: It is so chill, people are leveling, its great on retail
[5:31:47] thickthighs91: Hellfire penin had like 40 people in there yesterday
[5:31:48] TweakT: I like that I can level to 50 in all Classic areas
[5:31:48] wolvepg: You say that because you can play beta and not retail all the time
[5:31:50] Cypfer: i'm only leveling now but max for every class is enough for me
[5:31:51] Nesrath: its fun to see everyone out leveling
[5:31:57] Nesrath: plus the world pvp is a blast :D
[5:31:58] muertomans: classic is good for like 2 weeks of nostalgia
[5:31:58] Thepalestino: Very true
[5:31:59] swordart_19: @mcgrillidan how many classic streamers do you see ? KEKW
[5:32:00] kharditv: mythic raider dont have fun
[5:32:02] BramishEU: I think the quick lvln has helped that
[5:32:02] TommyVercetii: god i love that they did the level squish
[5:32:02] LordKain73: Retail leveling > Classic leveling
[5:32:03] KELLoGG_: i mean.. i came back to 8.3 to play shadowlands, so i feel like 8.3 was around too long, not to mention all that was there before lol
[5:32:03] LFDG343: BFA is my least favorite expansion
[5:32:05] Drakenking: @Vigi9413 You dont see how doing dumb shit with your friends while half of them play the game for the first time is fun?
[5:32:05] Kauko13: number of people leveling and playin is insane... last time i saw that was WoD...
[5:32:06] casualboomer: @DeadlyDag I'm not saying give them the feat of strength, but giving casuals a chance at a decade old mount they never got a swing at? Where's the actual harm?
[5:32:10] aleck1776: Depends on what you want. Classic is ez raiding but hard leveling while retail is the opposite.
[5:32:15] Whofedjawz: @thickthighs91 shadowlands leveling?
[5:32:16] Xailen: bots make up half the classic numbers KEKW
[5:32:20] SilkeySmooth: so the same thing on retail with boosting m+ carries?...lol
[5:32:20] spookaninja_21: Most classic streamers have been streaming retail because they’re bored of classic
[5:32:20] thickthighs91: @Whofedjawz yep
[5:32:21] Cafe0le: will they announce 10.0 on the next blizzcon (not the virtual one)
[5:32:27] Coriollis: look Legion area is more crowded than Zandalar / Boralus , there are tons of people doing Class Orders adn stuff is realy fun
[5:32:28] MrTerkyMan: Classic is just so easy mode lol
[5:32:29] Ookagari_: So whats with the title?
[5:32:31] Broomba: classic would have been great if it was actually 1.12.1 not 1.13.1 (BC) in vanillar
[5:32:32] TweakT: at least u admit Clashick woW leveling is the bomb
[5:32:33] Muaytitus: private servers actually had more support tho
[5:32:36] Poriand: I’m ready for Diablo 4
[5:32:38] swordart_19: I think right now Lvling si better :P
[5:32:39] Jawdane3D: TRUE
[5:32:42] Whofedjawz: @thickthighs91 what is your favourite zone?
[5:32:43] HelloFrendo: Think we’re finally getting a break from the BFA treadmill, no pressure to stay on top of current content since shadowland’s around the corner
[5:32:44] foxies_havocing: classic lvling amazing? idk far from it for me :D
[5:32:46] m_for_mandals: @Poriand this!
[5:32:46] swordart_19: In retail :P
[5:32:47] muertomans: whoa take it ez retail peeps, i dont play classic at all lmao. was just making a joke bc slands was supposed to be out today and i want new stuff :(
[5:32:49] TMMOOF: @casualboomer Its legacy content. You want it, go farm it like everyone else. 100% drop chance is ridiculous ...
[5:32:50] noChance219: Fresh Classic when ? FeelsBadMan
[5:32:50] WhoSaidObeya: SWTOR leveling tops wow imo
[5:32:50] DeadlyDag: @casualboomer as I said, if they make it current (as in timwealking raids) - that would be awesome. But if they made the mount-drops 100% again, people wouldn't like it, since MANY have farmed for years for many mounts. Believe me, it will never happen. Take karazhan for example. It was revamped, and they revamped the mount as well. Works perfectly.
[5:32:59] SilkeySmooth: retail is a joke right now
[5:33:02] Vigi9413: I think Shadowlands can be up there with Legion when it's done
[5:33:03] Broomba: i hope BC classic is true to BC leveling and scaling like in 2.4.3 @towelliee
[5:33:03] Motivess: Classic leveling is amazing
[5:33:05] Kinghorn: classic leveling is great
[5:33:05] calcutr0n: I'm so bored of classic, im starting to not care about naxx :(
[5:33:07] J_Day_: swtor leveling was nice the first time around
[5:33:08] Siddydiddydo: slow doesnt equal amazing
[5:33:08] thickthighs91: @Whofedjawz OL Nagrand was my fac
[5:33:09] DeadlyDag: @TMMOOF I didn't get that one :p Why shouldn't you collect flying?
[5:33:10] kelkkun3: classic leveling was fun in 2005, now its tedious and a grind tbh
[5:33:12] totallypayingattention: classic leveling bored me out of the game
[5:33:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: I still do classic leveling
[5:33:16] KaptainKarma: What do you think the legion timewalking mount will be?
[5:33:16] Hestert: I rerolled a shaman on classic and didnt spam dungeons and i agree
[5:33:17] LordKain73: I got my warlock to level 4 in classic and said nope.....not again. Went back to retail.
[5:33:17] Cox_The_Gemini: the drama surrounding classic is what makes me uninterested lol everyone i know who plays it has a shit ton of guild drama
[5:33:17] KuromiBlackheart: @HelloFrendo BFA? What's that? Kappa
[5:33:20] Redreka: classic leveling is awesome stuff, solo warrior is TOUGH
[5:33:21] Fitty204: Whjts the current time frame of 50-60 leveling in beta?
[5:33:21] Poriand: I’ve been making gold before SL . Getting rich!
[5:33:26] WhoSaidObeya: true
[5:33:27] Kisswani: the story made SWTOR leveling so damn amazing
[5:33:29] crawcook: It's fun if you have a guild who doesn't care about mid maxing
[5:33:30] noChance219: Classic lvl'ing is awesome, but boostie meta destroys that.
[5:33:32] redtemplar88: Hours long Sunken Temple runs. Man nostalgia
[5:33:33] Sonatta: so classic SWTOR LUL
[5:33:33] dyronee: who wants to level in an MMORPG? It's all about endgame.
[5:33:42] Vigi9413: @Fitty204 9-10 hours played
[5:33:44] Stonefather: I didn't like the tediousness of Classic leveling back in Vanilla and I definitely don't care for it now Keepo
[5:33:44] speedkamera: GA!
[5:33:45] okNate: i always liked leveling in GW2, dont need to go from quest hub to quest hub. just explore and join in on events and hearts that are around the map.
[5:33:46] D3m0nHunt3r666: Current leveling feels like an obligation
[5:33:48] aloneaga1n: How long does it take to get from 50-60 in sl beta?
[5:33:49] Alienfromger: you forgot FF14 leveling LUL
[5:33:51] Drakenking: @dyronee Thats a more modern form of thinking then you'd think
[5:33:51] jadeoxe: classic and retail both have their problems just up to the person on what ones they can deal with
[5:33:52] KuromiBlackheart: love me some star wars
[5:33:53] ImClouded: SWTOR was so badass when it came out
[5:33:54] noChance219: SWG ? Fk yeah
[5:33:54] AxiosImmortal: how does swtor leveling work now? just do the class story?
[5:33:57] MJadeS99: omg yeah i would love a classic SWTOR
[5:34:00] tr0kgaming: You thinking of Doing alpha one testing for Ashes of Creation ? @Towelliee
[5:34:01] okNate: @ImClouded hell yeah it was
[5:34:01] Xantoszz: Only thing I could think to make leveling better in classic was the update to quest logs so you could at least see where to turn stuff in
[5:34:03] thiccsushi: rift LUL
[5:34:07] GoKu1g: Starwars: Galaxys was amazing
[5:34:07] Shrenko: Rift Prime was fun but it took too long to lvl
[5:34:09] Drakenking: @dyronee You have to remember MMOs sprang from the likes of Everquest where you lost experience and loot when you died
[5:34:10] ZyntosAran: rift :(
[5:34:12] Heatiou: what about tera
[5:34:12] ohTsias: rift couldnt compete with wotlk
[5:34:14] watpuppy: Rift Prime did not fail lmao. It did what it was intended to do
[5:34:16] okNate: @GrandpaSparkles i got alpha 2 access for AoC. fingers crossed
[5:34:16] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[5:34:17] Jkeyboards: Starwars Galaxies was the best
[5:34:19] aleck1776: Classic for me is going back and doing stuff i couldnt do back in the day. Idc about it being hard or whatever. Ill play retail if i want a hard raiding environment.
[5:34:19] smokingcactus: SWG is still around but only on EMU
[5:34:21] Drakenking: No
[5:34:23] JustGotBaked: !ga
[5:34:23] Steelen: Tera closed didnt it?
[5:34:24] calcutr0n: @imclouded bruh I used to wreck huttball as jugg
[5:34:24] thekingt: Who is gonna bring up WildStar
[5:34:24] noChance219: @GoKu1g Yes, yes it was. I played SWG prior to WoW
[5:34:25] PvtHudson093: SWG pre NCU
[5:34:25] Nalleys: Questing now totaly feels like an obligation... either quest or have nothing at max level
[5:34:30] hi_im_gram: KOTOR?
[5:34:30] Jawdane3D: gw2 Kappa ?
[5:34:31] thiccsushi: tera has been on life support for years now
[5:34:31] BigBroaz: swtor? the whole thing is a struggle bus
[5:34:32] TheCliffyShow: When I first played SWTOR at release, it had fantastic leveling thanks to the story and cutscenes.
[5:34:32] oggarlic_: I miss the space one
[5:34:32] Skullgrinx: Waiting for Wildstar Classic
[5:34:33] Samaellus: i stil do :D
[5:34:33] Amnesy1: swtor was incredible, so sad that it kinda died
[5:34:33] Mitune: Oldschool Runescape has become a money laundering racket
[5:34:34] Motivess: NEver liked Tera lol
[5:34:34] ShiftsEU: Is Aion still going?
[5:34:35] casualboomer: @DeadlyDag "just no" isn't a good reason for it. The bulk of the player base doesn't grind these things the way guys like Towelliee do. From a business perspective, you'll pull far more people in than you'd alienate. And WoW, at the end of the day, has to remain profitable. Finding ways to revitalize old content in a novel way while giving access to difficult to attain loot would pull in more casual players than it would drive off elitist a-holes
[5:34:36] swordart_19: ASHES release 2077 KEKW
[5:34:39] oggarlic_: WILDSTAR LULW
[5:34:41] realiteegaming: SHADOWLANDS IS LIVE

[5:34:48] Antdavs24: whens the alpha 1 lol isnt it suppose to be fall LUL
[5:34:50] ladenpt: dont play it due to nda. Play it 1st time on stream
[5:34:53] TheCliffyShow: People don't play Tera. They masturbate to Tera.
[5:34:53] speedkamera: SL Beta Key GA!
[5:34:54] NickMendesTV: wildstar was the realm jam

[5:35:00] AxiosImmortal: swg is way better than swtor for sure
[5:35:00] watpuppy: @Towelliee Wildstar was an amazing MMORPG. The PvP sucked though and the raids were really hard so that deterred people
[5:35:01] Alienfromger: april 2021 is alpha without NDA
[5:35:05] damperstv: @Poriand i wish

[5:35:35] its_andyd: REKT m8
[5:35:37] Stonefather: Pre alpha Alpha 1 doesn't have one
[5:35:37] Aidler: they said many things
[5:35:37] anorfidus: Only some parts
[5:35:38] TooHonest: Just weekend testing
[5:35:39] Tehimage: I remember wildstar arenas, some classes abilities were so broken they could range damage through walls but you couldn't hit them
[5:35:39] calcutr0n: like the first 3 phases I think
[5:35:39] Cox_The_Gemini: no NDA for the last phase before beta
[5:35:39] thickthighs91: @Towelliee they are doing that so people dont have a BAD first impression
[5:35:41] dhafydd: did you sign an NDA?
[5:35:41] thekingt: They posted a time line recently
[5:35:42] anorfidus: the content creator one isn't
[5:35:42] tr0kgaming: not until March
[5:35:44] Mecabeast: thats phase 3 or 4 i think they have a chart

[5:35:48] Steelen: Why do these companies put up NDAs on MMOs -.-
[5:35:49] rsimpson105: @towelliee the early part, all that is pre alpha
[5:35:50] Coriollis: asmon said is NDA so he can't stream and won't play till is lifted
[5:35:53] duffluv22: Whats NDA???
[5:35:56] crawcook: yes
[5:35:56] Antdavs24: @Towelliee heard netflix doing an Assasins Creed series

[5:36:01] Siddydiddydo: wildstar had the best housing of any game in history, I hope a company scoops us the code they used for it
[5:36:02] DeadlyDag: @casualboomer exactly. hence why they revamp it all when they do it :p Again, Karazhan is a perfect example. They revamped it. They still included a mount. It was re-done, but still looks like the old one - and everyone was/is happy about it. That way they make profit and all players are happy :)

[5:39:23] EveryNameTakenWTF: ashes is fucking trash
[5:39:25] kofijuve: nobody believes there will be a better MMO that wow like ever
[5:39:25] BramishEU: You never know with MMOs, some have been great but had a shelf life
[5:39:28] wild_corndogs: wow is dead when Blizz says its dead
[5:39:28] FLManPlays: Warhammer was supposed to kill WOW. I remeber all the forum posts about that
[5:39:29] TooHonest: @Towelliee They put out a ton of content. I'd be curious to see your opinion on alot of the videos and info that has been released.
[5:39:33] DeadlyDag: @casualboomer what do you mean? I just provided one. And with the solution I mentioned (and that's the one they've used in the past), everyone is happy. The 30% that farm mounts wouldn't like it if they made 'hard to get'-mounts easy to get again in revamped content. With what you're saying, they will have an angry mob, with what they've always done, they don't get any. I don't see what's so hard to get with that. It works! :)

[5:39:45] Siddydiddydo: sounds like wow classic right
[5:39:47] mrbzombie: I still remember rift "we're not in azeroth any more"

[5:39:52] babakndn: us is live ?
[5:39:53] Malarky33: 0 casuals

[5:39:54] LordKain73: Yup....45 days to max level 1 toon? Nope....hard pass for me.
[5:39:54] Weeaboo__Chad: So I just grinded to Grand Marshal in classic wow
[5:39:54] ShiftsEU: the only wow killer is wow itself
[5:40:01] SDMaze: Wildstar was amazing it was the players that helped kill it. was always super toxic.
[5:40:02] xxsargexx: ashes just sounds too good to be true, its easy to talk about how they have all these features and whatnot, its another thing to actually implement it well
[5:40:03] Vigi9413: didn't that much grind kill BDO?
[5:40:05] Poriand: I hate leveling
[5:40:06] okNate: all these people with bobby kotick fleshlight just wanting to shit on everything else just for the sake of it
[5:40:06] MILESkg21: 45 what is this EQ1 LUL
[5:40:07] solsaver12: How can people trash and shit on a game thats not even released? LOL
[5:40:07] dym_jt: @Towelliee in EU, for countries that have summer and wintertime (CET/CEST etc) experiences the same, during one of the times stuff resets at 8 AM and 9 AM with the other, can't quite remember which is which though.
[5:40:08] Baaltaza: I miss Warhammer Online
[5:40:08] theDirtyon3: classic takes a couple weeks
[5:40:09] swordart_19: @tamoya21 so much afking ffor you!
[5:40:11] Drakenking: 45 days if you played Classic without a Map maybe
[5:40:14] Tzarvahl: @ShiftsEU its seems to be doin that just fine lol
[5:40:15] tubbyrhino: a year to hit max for a player with a full time job lol
[5:40:16] Maicoh: if the levelling experience is really good than i say who gives an eff
[5:40:16] Drakenking: and asked players for directions in say chat
[5:40:20] Lloydbanksz: The only wow killer is wow classic Kappa
[5:40:21] SG_World: 28 days later...
[5:40:22] totallypayingattention: 45 days? better be some fun leveling or everyone going to gtfo after first 30 days
[5:40:22] idenkaz_: BDO is far from dead lmao. stop pls
[5:40:25] Motivess: The leveling is gonna have raids and outdoor bosses and stuff, it isnt all at endgame content @Towelliee
[5:40:26] hizofia: more concerned about end game content than levelling tbh
[5:40:30] annatom: @Vigi9413 bdo is not dead and stronger than every
[5:40:31] refluxuations: wow classic definitely took that long back in the day. The fastest leveling was 24 hours a day never logging off for well over a week
[5:40:36] swordart_19: Sounded like STAR CIITIZEN KEKW
[5:40:36] Weeaboo__Chad: @swordart_19 you can't afk to 14 lol
[5:40:37] Ex__Drip: classic is ass tho
[5:40:37] AlienneAshford: It's weird because like, in reality you don't ever want a WoW killer, you want a game like FFXIV that can coexist with wow and breed semi-healthy rivalry.
[5:40:38] Mecabeast: no one want to spend all their time leveling while their friends are doing endgame
[5:40:39] nikola: what game is he talking about? just tuned in
[5:40:40] swordart_19: 2077 RELEASE

[5:41:23] TooHonest: @Towelliee Yo, have you seen Lazy's new video?

[5:41:30] Shrenko: isnt he abit shady aswell?
[5:41:33] SubQ: isn't some kind of scam artist behind AoC though?
[5:41:34] HomuraSage: how so

[5:44:02] smokingcactus: so why is rtx not working? i have a 2070 super.
[5:44:02] KuromiBlackheart: @magemyway just because of how other games have handled their launches and betas. it's easy to tell the direction AoC is going to go. It might do well for a little while, or maybe have a good start. But for it to be long lasting like WoW, or even GW2? or any other 10 yr+ game is a feat that most games these days do not even come close to managing.

[5:54:07] refluxuations: Blue protocol beta is nov 7th, and if it's any good i'll play that over shadowlands and refund
[5:54:09] msblub: i honestly care less about when, than knowing when so i can base things on it
[5:54:12] IamZephi: @Towelliee what if they release Shadowlands in line with p6 for Classic? that way both retail and classic players can do the Scourge event
[5:54:12] Tzarvahl: activision CEO gonna have to fork over some money for a 2nd team to help work on future expansions
[5:54:17] Toon11: nov 16th - 30th is the anniversary stuff

[5:54:22] Vol71: But if you release during the 29th you have the complications of them not releasing
[5:54:23] spookaninja_21: Them keeping to their guns saying it was going to be an oct release with the pandemic was very arrogant of them at first.

[5:54:30] wild_corndogs: But do they really want to contend with Cyberpunk 2077? Its to much of a titan every game maker is avoid
[5:54:32] Vol71: because its the holiday.
[5:54:33] KillaFin: @wannabelock That's why a delay was fricken pointless cause it's coming out in late november to early december. Ya'll dreamin on that 28th of december release
[5:54:33] captiv8: battle ready!!!

[5:55:07] kadiran_the_priest: plot twist the scourge invasion is todat
[5:55:09] KuromiBlackheart: @TacticalByte it's wise to usually wait a few days after big patches, normally imo. but because of covid I just wouldn't count on anything being released normally.
[5:55:10] swordart_19: Isnt Blue Protocol releaseing next year ?
[5:55:10] MagicHoof: Jon Snow
[5:55:14] Rictamar: December 1st or December 8th is the date
[5:55:18] wannabelock: @KillaFin tbh i think its more likely now to be a jan 2021 release i dont see them doing it on chirstmas time so i think its all the way back to jan now
[5:55:21] duffluv22: Have they stopped the Shadowland commercials?
[5:55:22] foxies_havocing: lvling affliction is sooooo easy I pull all I can see including rares and can kill them all no sweatr
[5:55:23] Betrys: @towelliee did you see Netflix is making an assassins creed series
[5:55:24] pist0lpete129: are we gonna have SL till 2022 ?
[5:55:31] bionicbeaver35: is the death rising event in this patch?
[5:55:32] SrCorgan: SL Beta Key GA!
[5:55:38] smokingcactus: @Gylduran so why is it dumb?
[5:55:43] ADOMINATOR: @Towelliee plz dont release Dec 1st, my poor finals
[5:55:46] StreamElements: Download Raid: Shadow Legends, for free on PC and Mobile!https://strms.net/raid_towelliee_timer
[5:55:51] snuffles_80: why cant they push up the raid part? @Towelliee
[5:55:54] HaCKeD_S14: Why couldnt they lock instances until Jan @Towelliee and launch on the 7th of dec
[5:55:56] LoseAlotLuke: Everyone and their mothers will be on cyberpunk,assassins creed and demons souls in november @Towelliee
[5:55:56] Rictamar: @smokingcactus because Blizz isn't releasing an xpac the week everyone will be off for Thanksgiving
[5:55:58] NethalarTTV: What is this game Towelliee?
[5:55:58] Drakenking: That seems like the best option to me
[5:56:01] Drakenking: But we'll see
[5:56:06] Ortinoth: Raid schedule is normally 2 weeks after release - unless they extend the raid release times
[5:56:08] thickthighs91: im n t0pppp
[5:56:10] jerexify: Yes! 12/29!
[5:56:10] tszord: release it all on day 1. True race to world first
[5:56:14] realReignn: They released cata in December with raids together same day
[5:56:15] smokingcactus: @Gylduran well i am sticking to that so yeah get over it
[5:56:19] Drakenking: Push the raid 1-2 weeks let us all bask in the new expansion glory
[5:56:20] KillaFin: Blizzard don't get to choose, activision chooses the dates and bobby needs his 4rth Jacuzzi KEKW
[5:56:23] mmrghost7: that would be some meme
[5:56:23] Rictamar: it will release first or second week of december and raid will be delayed to Jan
[5:56:24] Affiiance: Delaying the Raid that long seems like a bad idea imo. Better to just release the 29th
[5:56:24] jaalexba: damn is that Florida?
[5:56:25] IamZephi: the wilhelm screams. lol
[5:56:25] swordart_19: @W0LFDEN biggest nonsense
[5:56:25] J53LG: #thickthighs91 because you save lives
[5:56:26] crawcook: Another Blizzard vet dev left from Hearthstone yesterday btw. The brain dran is real.
[5:56:29] Lexi__Marie: release dec 8th raids jan 8th ez
[5:56:31] VegiXTV: i think you're right, the 1st or the 8th of december. maybe the 15th? i doubt november, all november seems bad
[5:56:32] MILESkg21: they had us raiding in WOD during holidays so why not do it again LUL
[5:56:33] Subtlekaos: Good morning hammer squad!! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:56:34] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: Nov. 24th is event.....Dec 8th is release and there gonna release raids first week of Jan I bet money on it
[5:56:37] Rictamar: @smokingcactus well you are dumb but entitled to your opinion :)
[5:56:38] grizwtv: Watcha eating
[5:56:39] DryR: They will determine which quarter/Yr they want to realize the revenue of preorders and release in Dec or Jan
[5:56:40] swordart_19: @KillaFin that is why it got delayed 10/10 logic
[5:56:40] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: if I was a betting man
[5:56:42] pist0lpete129: how long do you think we will have SL for? typical 2 years?
[5:56:42] Hyvest: @KillaFin It's literally the same company. LUL
[5:56:43] Maroleb: LUL
[5:56:43] aidiotat: They just got a bunch of 6 month subs anyway
[5:56:46] hunterxp: LUL
[5:56:47] MILESkg21: KEKW
[5:56:47] tetrahydridodinitrogen: truuuu

[5:56:49] BrickSteeze: lol
[5:56:50] Drakenking: Thats how companies work
[5:56:51] Aktz_: they dont want to delay anything else now so29th seems more likely
[5:56:52] LegacyofTork: they would get so much more credit for a 2021 release, taking the time to make it better. they already paid the price for delaying it today, might as well make it count
[5:56:52] Sonatta: #truth
[5:56:52] Vol71: @Towelliee It makes more sense to me to release the game early decemeber than to release the game and have the countless issues during christmas/new years week.
[5:56:53] smokingcactus: @Gylduran and you are ignorate POS too
[5:56:54] Tzarvahl: wouldn't doubt it honestly
[5:56:56] Coriollis: he just need another plane be reasonable guys :)
[5:56:57] Tzarvahl: worse shit happens lmao
[5:56:57] Stonefather: Bobby definitely has more than four Jacuzzis, what you mean he needs a third yacht that has six more Jacuzzis
[5:57:03] Ortinoth: @KillaFin incorrect Activisiton doesn't make the decsions for raid events or openings that still is part of blizzard control
[5:57:08] Angelraven13: Lol.
[5:57:17] realReignn: decemeber 7th 2010 cataclysm was released maybe they do the same thing for SL @Towelliee
[5:57:20] Vol71: I would assume most people would rather deal with delayed raids for mythic than have the issue of a fucked up launch.
[5:57:20] MILESkg21: every pool requires them to fire another 500 people Kappa
[5:57:31] 101deathbringer: what time do you think servers will be back up
[5:57:31] Rictamar: @smokingcactus you just called yourself a piece of shit, nice one
[5:57:44] BilieOSRS: Have u decided what class you will main in SL?
[5:57:49] Aktz_: KEKW
[5:57:50] Sonatta: oof
[5:57:51] gruntpunch: most studios shut down the week of xmas and new years
[5:57:51] KillaFin: @swordart_19 IT got delayed cause the people at the studio begged for more time. Of course, that was always going to be pointless because that was only going to buy them an extra month.
[5:57:55] lethaldestny: lethaldestny subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[5:57:55] Moobot: @LETHALDESTNY with the 23 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[5:57:55] Menion01: Wow....people are going to take vacation during the holidays?
[5:57:55] Stonefather: Have to spend honor points to get time off for Christmas danSad
[5:58:00] EthicalHermit: i guess it makes sense, if they are all going to be on vacation after the 15th, to release it then since nothing will change anyway
[5:58:00] Maroleb: yikes those honor points
[5:58:01] SpicyFeta: !battle
[5:58:02] Moobot: Play Stream Raiders with me at https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee LETS OWN THE BATTLEFIELD!
[5:58:02] Wilburific: Like we arent already in trouble LUL
[5:58:03] mmrghost7: things are getting rough
[5:58:04] HaCKeD_S14: yeah but almost everyone takes off betwen xmas and new years in businesses
[5:58:05] tommy_thick: are the servers up yet for NA?
[5:58:08] tetrahydridodinitrogen: No Breaks No Bonuses HoHoHo MERRY CHRISTMAS
[5:58:09] LoseAlotLuke: Riots, strikes fires, shitshow in irviine @Towelliee
[5:58:13] Lexi__Marie: @Towelliee so december 8th release jan 8th raids is not possible?
[5:58:22] xch4se: What about this fire and the evacuations?
[5:58:25] dylandevsstuff: @Towelliee hows ur raid shadow legends going?
[5:58:32] gruntpunch: gruntpunch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hammers UP!
[5:58:33] Moobot: Thanks @GRUNTPUNCH for subbing for 8 months! towHAMUP
[5:58:34] Vol71: @Towelliee But what about support for launch?
[5:58:36] Ortinoth: i am still pretty confidant it will be a late Decemeber release
[5:58:37] 3am_Zinc: higher ups dont care
[5:58:41] popycool: @tommy_thick no they arent
[5:58:43] dylandevsstuff: sweet
[5:58:44] Vol71: If it's the 29th they won't have any cause they will be on break
[5:58:47] Rictamar: More people played back in Cata and Blizz had less resources though
[5:58:47] IamZephi: @Towelliee i honestly don't want a Dec release
[5:58:52] Rictamar: that is a bad comparison
[5:58:56] Thoreya: i assume they know they might have to work the holidays when the expansion got delayed
[5:58:57] AdoraVal: fenMheart
[5:58:58] Affiiance: Christie Golden tweeted everything was fine where she was as far as the fires go
[5:59:02] SeckSymbols: @3am_Zinc If higher ups didnt care, they wouldnt have delayed
[5:59:03] jessesdoinwork: whatcha eating there towlliee?!? SeemsGood SeemsGood
[5:59:08] Affiiance: Sai all clear skies there
[5:59:08] Tehimage: Doesn't matter it will be screwed up when they release it. It took them 4 almost 5 days to fix current expansion content for allinace players when BFA was unable to be started
[5:59:11] SeckSymbols: They would have told the community to suck it up and play a broken game
[5:59:12] thebakeriscomingforu: At this point I don't care when it releases. I just want the systems to work and the classes I play to not be garbage. lol
[5:59:17] totallypayingattention: what day blizz holiday end? that launch Kappa
[5:59:19] foxies_havocing: i'd rather have mid january release
[5:59:22] smokingcactus: delayed the expansion better be prepared to work some holiday time
[5:59:24] 5NE5: Just give me a good experience like i had with LK and Legion and i can wait.
[5:59:25] gruntpunch: I would guess mid December
[5:59:31] missbaelee: January
[5:59:31] Dcarter: id rather it come out in 2021
[5:59:32] MILESkg21: it really is more of a Q1 2021 then Kappa
[5:59:35] Dcarter: i have more games to beat
[5:59:35] Stonefather: They would have to launch the Scourge Invasion today if they wanted end of November release IMO
[5:59:37] Ledeanna: but Activision has no choice as pre-orders said Dec 31 or earlier if they release in 2021 enter the lawsuits
[5:59:38] AveragePvp: @Dcarter Same
[5:59:40] tulifau_: damn looking at the fire map online the closest fires are less than 4 miles from blizzard HQ
[5:59:41] TMMOOF: @Towelliee Have you ever had Bibimbap?
[5:59:43] VegiXTV: november 10th is call of duty, they dont wanna compete vs their own, then cyberpunk the 17th, thanksgiving the week after......dec 1 or 8th seem like the only choices
[5:59:45] smokingcactus: happens in every job if you delay a project you get like no time off to get it done and working right
[5:59:47] Dcarter: im so happy its not out no on the real
[5:59:47] jerexify: Or, and hear me out guys, they DON'T have to work holidays, and just release it on 12/29.....
[5:59:47] hamoodixyz: The interns won’t be lol
[5:59:48] LoseAlotLuke: To many games coming out just release 2021 fuck it @Towelliee
[5:59:49] Ortinoth: It won't be Jan
[5:59:51] Dcarter: now*\
[5:59:51] AdoraVal: They can't release in december - the level 59 beta quest to go into torghast is still bugged. Been bugged for over a week now.
[5:59:55] Affiiance: Push it back to the 29th IMO, got plenty of games to play in November
[5:59:55] SilkeySmooth: another month isnt going to fix anything it will stil lbe broken at launch
[5:59:55] tulifau_: as the crow flies that is
[5:59:56] Thoreya: if they originally wanted to launch this shit in october theres no way its gettting launched in january lol
[5:59:56] MILESkg21: have CP and Valhalla to master :)
[6:00:00] Aro725: its either december or they push it to next year. no shot for november
[6:00:02] pist0lpete129: blizzcon is Feb, they wont launch SL in Jan and raids the same week or 2 as Mythic raiding....
[6:00:03] Rictamar: @VegiXTV Exactly
[6:00:04] vaidexx: nobody know how close blizzard actually is and issues they are working on
[6:00:04] Thoreya: they wanna get this out as fast as they can
[6:00:04] SeckSymbols: January 2021 is a good spot so I can play Demon's Souls, Spiderman and Cyberpunk without interruption
[6:00:05] Ortinoth: Hello @Dcarter
[6:00:05] Subtlekaos: @towelliee is there any chance of you making a pally taking guide? Kinda like a full starter guide?
[6:00:05] VegiXTV: cyberpunk has too much of the same audience and would drown them out, but its a single player so it will be over in a week or two
[6:00:05] magemaster225: @RGDelta doesnt matter they did the same thing ith reforge and released it past the year date
[6:00:07] Vol71: Lol
[6:00:08] baksik88: hi is shadowlands coming after maintance ?

[6:00:16] MILESkg21: no
[6:00:17] Vol71: you guys think blizz will be in office the 25th-1st

[6:00:24] MrStitz: nop
[6:00:25] ItsWeirdge: i just wanted it today
[6:00:28] Coriollis: a month in advance yes would be great
[6:00:33] magemaster225: is that today?
[6:00:36] ronnir51: so in 40 minutes? Kappa
[6:00:36] gruntpunch: My buddy took a month off, RIP
[6:00:36] KuromiBlackheart: i'm not working atm so idc. just have it be a working expansion and i'm good
[6:00:36] LFDG343: Yes
[6:00:37] smokingcactus: I need to know a month in advance
[6:00:38] jerexify: For people who need to be able to schedule stuff, yes, please.
[6:00:39] Meta_meme: @Towelliee its always possible they release it early mid dec and just delay the release of the raid until after the new year
[6:00:39] Drakenking: @Vol71 no because they work from home :)
[6:00:40] OGxCarrot: Why do you need an advanced notice to drop an already delayed xpac?
[6:00:41] Goesmeistah: did not waste it but i like to plan ?
[6:00:41] wowking35: lore did it
[6:00:42] roflpotamus: today Pog
[6:00:42] mobbo: Could be today
[6:00:42] Dcarter: SL can takes it sweet precious time coming out

[6:00:48] Torsin: man ill be gone the week of thanksgiving im really hoping for the first week of december
[6:00:49] dSaipher: Does anyone know if they’ve fixed the beta yet? The intro to torghast is broken and literally unplayable @towelliee
[6:00:50] Ratchet_N_Crank: but why do u need a notice for the expac for anyways??
[6:00:50] KillaFin: I say just release the game alread KEKW papers down blizzard, just accept the trainwreck you created
[6:00:51] GraaMee: I think they will say something today
[6:00:53] 3rdbestboomy: i just want the game to be ready whether that measn tomoz or 31 dec just let the game be finished
[6:00:53] BMagicTX: The servers are still down?
[6:00:55] Thoreya: if they originally wanted to launch this shit in october theres no way its getting launched in january lol
[6:00:58] QQGamers: @Dcarter 100% agree
[6:00:59] tomcruise210: longer maintenence today too
[6:00:59] br0ther_tim: whats with the 4 hour maintenence then?
[6:01:01] Affiiance: I want time to play other games
[6:01:01] Vol71: @Drakenking It doesn't matter if they work from home or not, it's the holidays
[6:01:04] Coriollis: my bet is january when they come back for SL release
[6:01:05] SeckSymbols: It better not be November, Playstation 5 is more important than Shadowlands
[6:01:06] Drakenking: @KillaFin man you are annoying
[6:01:07] MILESkg21: KillaFin SAVAGE KEKW
[6:01:07] RazorKameo: surely we get some release info this week
[6:01:07] Sincline387: At this point after the sheer amount of crap I took on the blizzard forums saying delaying that close was kind of harsh, everyone can get bent and deal with a 1 week notice
[6:01:08] AdoraVal: This is a longer maintenance though - It could be today
[6:01:08] maxon1969: but didnt they do that akready?
[6:01:11] Tehimage: Why do they need 4 hours of maintenance today anyway
[6:01:12] thatguynamedbrandon: post today. first event friday
[6:01:14] bionicbeaver35: servers been done for hours again
[6:01:15] Dcarter: ps5 comes out soon
[6:01:19] Dcarter: SL can wait
[6:01:19] bionicbeaver35: down
[6:01:19] dylandevsstuff: @maxon1969 nah just for prepatch and said scourge later
[6:01:19] ZarisHeal: my bet is 15 december for new release date.
[6:01:22] mmrghost7: well.... shiit
[6:01:22] whiteknight657: it might be today
[6:01:23] Stonefather: They could easily do it during this down time, but again I doubt it's today it's highly unlikley.
[6:01:24] Themanz89: Good afternoon or whatever time it is at your places towHi
[6:01:24] Thoreya: nah i wanna play SL
[6:01:25] Wrath_Twitch: yeah I'd like notice for new vaca request
[6:01:26] Specsifier: We also had a huge amount of changes to the fights of Nathria and they haven't done a raid testing since those changes went up. How can we expect a date with an untested raid?
[6:01:26] Thoreya: it can come out now
[6:01:27] OGxCarrot: ps5 KEKW
[6:01:28] Vol71: If they released anytime during 25th-1st it would be a shit show.
[6:01:28] Thoreya: tf lol
[6:01:28] tulifau_: damn looking at the fire map online the closest fires are less than 4 miles from blizzard HQ as the crow flies @Towelliee
[6:01:36] Thasin22: whats the addon that keeps all the icon on your mini map on one button?
[6:01:40] KuromiBlackheart: i'm not expecting the event tbh
[6:01:40] RazorKameo: ive never used weak auras before. is it easier to set up?
[6:01:41] its_andyd: is lore not the community manager anymore? shouldnt he be all about this shit
[6:01:41] Steelen: How long would the servers be down for?
[6:01:43] Yun5ung: WOW
[6:01:43] Horuseternal69: @Dcarter 100% dude this game needs to take as much time as if feckin needs community needs to suck it up stfu and just wait so many impatient assholes is the problem
[6:01:44] SeckSymbols: New console release > WoW Expansion
[6:01:45] SeckSymbols: Not sorry
[6:01:47] Coriollis: let me buy dat PS5 to play the same PS4 games Kappa
[6:01:48] Yun5ung: Is this the new expac guys
[6:01:49] XshadowturkeyX: servers wouldnt be down till 11 if it wasnt comming out
[6:01:52] Murlocz: I just hope they fix Boomy druids Kappa
[6:01:52] Ortinoth: i hope its not today
[6:01:54] tomcruise210: PS5 at 400 is a huge pog
[6:01:54] Rictamar: yeh Nov release can fuck off, PS5, Ass Creed, Demon Souls, CYBERPUNK, yeh naw SL can wait until Dec
[6:01:55] TheKingOfWit: I do not expect the event to begin before xpac has a release date

[6:02:00] MILESkg21: yo ban that Scuba Guy Kappa
[6:02:00] Aro725: The maintenance today is still fixing realm connections im sure. Multiple ppl in my guild show up as old server names sometimes. I bet theyre still fixing that
[6:02:01] Lexi__Marie: @Towelliee but because youre the hype man you even have anything can happen in your title
[6:02:05] wild_corndogs: PCMR doesnt care about new consoles

[6:02:23] KillaFin: @Drakenking IF you think a delay will change the outcome your sorely mistaken. The vets on the team left a long time ago and the current team is comprised of the development equivalent of inters. They would need 4-5 months tops to even make the expansion half decent KEKW
[6:02:23] SeckSymbols: Be a rich boy and get both nerd

[6:03:12] Motivess: You dont need rockbiter anymore
[6:03:14] compliance: awesome
[6:03:15] Murlocz: @vaidexx it will only last longer if they develop endgame PvE content
[6:03:17] lycen1: @shrektard69 me too

[6:03:20] oraclespyro: @Towelliee did the fires die down or yall still in danger?
[6:03:21] RazorKameo: shaman is legit my fav class in pre patch it may have to be my SL main
[6:03:23] AlienTongue: they would of announced it
[6:03:23] MILESkg21: 445 :O
[6:03:26] Drakenking: @KillaFin Ok someone dropped you on your head as a child good to know, I guess my class isn't already balanced with the covenants within 50dps LULW Take your dumbass bit to the forums where someone actually cares
[6:03:28] pist0lpete129: u mean 145...?

[6:03:34] SeckSymbols: Shadow Priest right now is stupid fun, especially in PvP
[6:03:34] Murlocz: 445 = 100 ilvl
[6:03:35] NecromedesDK: ilvl 100 gear yes

[6:03:47] Windnecro: looking good spec wise, especially if you wanting to try windfury stuff
[6:03:48] Motivess: Wind Rush totem @Towelliee
[6:03:49] RazorKameo: Ascendance?
[6:03:49] Tehimage: yeah 100 ilvl wow you can get that from mythic 5

[6:04:05] Raaeni: yes
[6:04:05] DeadlyDag: @Tehimage hence _catchup_
[6:04:07] Windnecro: Ascendance is good, because of the aoe burst and more SS, but wolves let you double down on windfury cause lightning wolves
[6:04:14] Fr00b92: Wolves are RNG
[6:04:21] OldxTimer: ^
[6:04:24] KillaFin: @Drakenking Says the same guy who will later complain that this expansion is worse than BFA two months later while I am laughing in BC classic KEKW

It doesn't make me feel bad to have that opinion at all.

[6:49:35] Sin_GamingTV: @ozzythegreat Depends on what they have to do for maint. but because of SL coming up it'll take a little while, norm only lasts a couple hours unless a huge patch hits
[6:49:36] Shydigz: He prolly has some rights to WoW NO?
[6:49:37] xdunpealx: Yes :)
[6:49:37] Collected1: he doesnt own the rights to warcraft surely
[6:49:38] krisdahaka: KEKW
[6:49:38] Xailen: He would create a new type of world like Warcraft, but it would not be apart of blizz.
[6:49:39] minirine_: you cant own the noun of warchief.. lmfao
[6:49:40] Neronis: Hi chat. Are the US servers still offline?

[6:49:51] tubbyrhino: warchief is too common of a word. world of warcraft did not come up with the word warchief
[6:49:51] Trafikk_: Metzen added, “It was a privilege to be able to work on all those worlds at Blizzard for all those years. But in this phase of my life, I guess I would say out loud, I’m interested in owning my own ideas. I’m interested in being able to develop them the way my gut tells me I should, without oversight of people I don’t know. That’s a big theme for me, that ownership and authorship.”
[6:49:51] xDreddx: doesnt he still own rights
[6:49:53] realReignn: you cant trademark the term Warchief too broad

[6:50:09] Motivess: I got timed out because I used a quote with the presidents name @Broomba
[6:50:10] roadkill3s: he should still have some kind of control over warcraft, diablo, and starcraft as he was the lead writer for all the original lore
[6:50:10] cappei: As if a scummy company like Blizzard wouldn't do that lmao
[6:50:12] 5NE5: AY YOU DAMN RIGHT

[6:50:19] Venasmat: It's not like the term "Warchief" is trademarked anyway
[6:50:20] pereadin: Well it’s an Activision game now too so wouldn’t surprise me if they sue him
[6:50:21] thebakeriscomingforu: He wouldn't get sued for using Warchief. lol
[6:50:21] Collected1: two things would make me unsub, sylvanas being killed off and them going after metzen legally

[7:33:37] pantsgrab__c9: How do I find all of your add on's you are using rn? @Towelliee
[7:33:40] CrFPayn3: scourge invasion is a myth like shadowlands
[7:33:41] Rudric_Ice: does rtx actually work or it's scuffed ?
[7:33:42] DragonofWolves: Well i mean seeing how Witcher 3 is regarded as a very well selling AAA title. I'm sure CP2077 won't disappoint even if it is delayed and its not even that long of one
[7:33:43] toobaked1987: @Towelliee Corsaire is looking very sexy huh my dude???? :D

[7:33:50] slade_msf: @towelliee are you working out these days? if you don't mind me asking, what is your current BMI?

[7:33:54] ApexBullets: i really wish Battlegrounds were worth more xp. I get so bored questing
[7:33:57] SeckSymbols: Just tanks frames and adds no substance
[7:34:04] pantsgrab__c9: !addon
[7:34:08] snuffap: Scourge isn’t this week what’s your hurry
[7:34:09] Syrc0: @Towelliee do you think the wildfire near the Blizzard Officce will cause a second delay? Maybe early Jan?
[7:34:10] kay4964: why you say no event today?
[7:34:11] swordart_19: @TheScubaSteve693 as in any game 4Head
[7:34:12] Falouh: wow
[7:34:14] Killingsmoke_ps4: @Towelliee i find it strange how we came from a launch today to no launch date at all: Im afraid this silence is pure to keep subs on.
[7:34:21] Menion01: They have to know by now internally a release date. It’s really getting annoying that they aren’t releasing a timeline.
[7:34:23] SeckSymbols: @swordart_19 You never played Control then ;)
[7:34:29] CrunkyBrewster: i didnt think they would bother to mention it honestly. IIRC from back in TBC, the Invasion started with Infected Rats in stormwind and Org and it led up to the Invasion over a few days
[7:34:32] Rudric_Ice: @thescubasteve693 Ty's it's useless gotcha
[7:34:40] swordart_19: @TheScubaSteve693 uses same thing

[7:35:54] MrGattz: @Raijuu88 its because your not putting spaces in between the words. moobot considers it one massive word
[7:36:02] Kasharan: windfury weapon
[7:36:03] SeckSymbols: @swordart_19 which is why it is useless in WoW, games like Control and Cyberpunk will be RTX showcases. Control was phenomenal even on a 2060 Super
[7:36:07] Ortinoth: put windfurry buff on main hand and flametonque on offhand
[7:36:23] xR1ZEx: good job
[7:36:27] Yagr6: @MrGattz im done
[7:36:27] Hybridsteve: yes
[7:36:28] Windnecro: yup
[7:36:29] DragonofWolves: MrGattz so moobot considers that spam or something?
[7:36:34] Ortinoth: windfury weapon is the skill
[7:36:41] SeckSymbols: I hate Moobot
[7:36:49] ArcaneLight: same for poisons i assume
[7:36:54] MrGattz: @dragonofwolves if you have a string of characters longer than i think 24 its considered spam yeah
[7:36:55] sarcasmfont: ugh servers not ready until after 12pm now....
[7:36:56] 91Niki: Moobot is a snowflake sometimes. Don't judge
[7:37:06] ArcaneSyntax: windfury is way better than oils anyway
[7:37:09] Ortinoth: oils overwrite
[7:37:11] Hidden_Citizen: and your shield too
[7:37:16] Rudric_Ice: ye we need a Cowbot
[7:37:16] Hidden_Citizen: the lightning shield
[7:37:17] MrGattz: but only for non subs @dragonofwolves
[7:37:19] DragonofWolves: 91Niki simping for moobot are we? LUL
[7:37:22] nasual: "snowflake". Yikes.

[7:37:32] PrimalRain: is it random though? Kappa
[7:37:32] turbo_aces_bro: it could be scourge invasion surprise
[7:37:34] Velirith: maybe its happening without them saying anything Kappa
[7:37:34] prelus_twitch: what the heck servers are sTILL down
[7:37:37] sarcasmfont: that's why it's disappointing
[7:37:37] Moobot: Play Stream Raiders with me at https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee LETS OWN THE BATTLEFIELD!
[7:37:38] Ortinoth: at least anoter hour
[7:37:38] Herzenliegen: Could be less employees due to the fire

[7:37:41] SithLordBob: is the event today? PogChamp the scourge invasion?
[7:37:43] TexRex88: invasion could still be happening...
[7:37:45] Aaradin: I mean irvine is almost on fire i doubt they have very many people there
[7:37:46] Rudric_Ice: yes this is classic
[7:37:50] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee They would have you think its a random Tuesday Kappa
[7:37:52] IlolI: wait they extended maintenance??
[7:37:53] redtemplar88: It's to help fix server lag issues on high pop servers no doubt. HOPEFULLY
[7:37:55] Deathdealer1837: dont forget to drop your windfury totem as well
[7:37:56] xSoldierhardx: @Towelliee it could be cause of the wildfires and everyone working mostly from home and unable to reach servers a possibility
[7:38:02] Hidden_Citizen: holy, how many buttons do shamans have?
[7:38:06] Hidden_Citizen: Shman seems complex

[7:38:29] quickleyszn: The big thing in the middle means LB CL or HS is instant
[7:38:29] doomkry: dw just drop the invasion first in europe so we can test it out for NA Kappa
[7:38:30] hunterxp: "just strong" :D
[7:38:32] dollarnuggs: its a legendary.. everyone elses is insane why cant shamans be
[7:38:33] Yagr6: @Towelliee these weak auras make this rotation harder than it actually is smh

[7:39:03] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 1297 units were placed on the battlefield.
[7:39:04] AgentWhiskeyy: pushed maintenance another hour
[7:39:06] wellborn: I thought enhance was not doing well in SL...Is that info wrong?

[7:49:00] rezanjin: hearthstone out of the boss you clown
[7:49:00] Wrenton: @dragonofwolves not really my point. my point is they should have delayed it or announced the delay much much earlier when they HAD that excuse. Now after almost a year since most places went to work from home.. its becoming a bit of a crutch.
[7:49:04] khazgor1: Kappa
[7:49:11] ArcaneSyntax: enhances self heal is pretty bad ngl
