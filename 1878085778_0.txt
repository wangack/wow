[0:28:00] jonathanezt: damn ur mic is f**kin lit
[0:28:02] longwood99999: Why you play? Servers should be dooooooown
[0:28:07] Vanguarded: Yeah but they did ad malignant power. So you get three extra aspect powers essentially. I feel there will still be a big power creep. Just damage is in different places now.
[0:28:23] Bogue_TheRogue: anyone else having problems with EU servers? cant log in....
[0:28:45] Tursventon: yep
[0:28:49] Vanguarded: So they are like item aspects
[0:28:50] Ev0hz: That's the new seasonal mechanic
[0:28:53] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:29:02] Vanguarded: That you extract fro legendary gear. But it’s a drip from@monsters
[0:29:16] Vanguarded: You put it into jewellery and get powers
[0:29:25] Vanguarded: Similar to the aspects you got from dungeons.
[0:29:26] SSD511_: D4 it’s for people who love poe and the endless grind, not for me I’ll be bored so fast
[0:29:33] Schlounce: Say you get a weapon that blows people up as a proc,  you can put that proc in as jewelry
[0:30:08] Vanguarded: So here’s how it works
[0:30:43] Rando1988: It's av weekend swifty

[0:31:59] Vanguarded: Malignant power is the seasonal mechanic. When you sometimes slay elite enemies you can resummon them and kill then to get their heart. The seasonal material is then used to help in crafting. Your jewellery will have I think 4 different potential colours. Orange blue black and red. Each colour goes in its respective socket. These powers are essentially what aspects where (legendary powers that you could extract at the enchanter)
[0:32:06] hoognetty: sweeping strikes is fun too
[0:32:18] ImaSaraBot: are you going to be in the level 20 tourny?
