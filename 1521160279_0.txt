[1:14:04] dracullus: exact day was always few months before release
[1:14:06] TheItalianStallion321: i read somewhere on Twitter or a discord where someone is estimated Lich King classic to be released in 8 weeks.

[1:14:16] Necrom93: I wonder if the 50% xp boost in prepatch is going to make questing odd. I imagine you'll out-level quest chains to go to new areas before you're done with them.
[1:14:30] Korupcija_: I disagree, they announced S4 a month in advance(usually 2 weeks)

[1:32:36] Nico_vdM: So quicker to get to 80
[1:32:43] silodin: harder heroic?
[1:33:12] keyboardturner: WoW fantasy world data download faster than my internet trying to open a basic html web page back in the day
[1:33:25] kelnyolo: back then bc gear was more than fine to clear naxx sartarion normal mode and maly... no needs to farm 5 men hero
[1:33:33] Vanhoek: Are you gonna main DK for wrath or stick with what you are comfy with on Paladin?
[1:33:40] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: warrior in vanilla could dual wield
[1:33:42] mmo_kenna_: New diablo immortal boss dropped, no where near powerful enough to do it tho...
[1:34:13] Vanhoek: THey seem pretty ambitious with that 2022 release date placeholder
[1:34:14] ijuki: @mmo_kenna_ Ouch
[1:34:29] Vanhoek: Alpha gonna start after wrath launch?
[1:34:45] almostdps: shaman?

[1:34:56] Kale_Nd: Hati
[1:35:24] Nico_vdM: I think you also came here to get hati back as pet
[1:35:29] Vanhoek: Do you think they release the 50% xp buff on the 5th with prepatch 2 weeks after?
[1:35:30] DeltaChr0n0s: Lovin the music
[1:35:31] Nico_vdM: But might have that mixed up
[1:35:38] Korupcija_: I heard DF releases on 23rd Novemeber and Naxx on 3rd of December
[1:35:57] Vanhoek: Yeah
[1:35:58] kelnyolo: too long RP quests... wasted XP/hour LUL
[1:36:01] CritcobainTV: Nah, i dont think there's a shot they're sending prepatch that soon
[1:36:02] Thoreya: @Korupcija_ DF a day before my bday pog
[1:36:08] Vanhoek: They said they want to release it two weeks before prepatch
[1:36:10] CritcobainTV: they JUST released beta
[1:36:11] almostdps: Have they said if the fresh servers are gonna be up at prepatch or only at launch?
[1:36:13] Herzenliegen: @nico_vdm no your right. It was to tame all the different colors
[1:36:21] dracullus: @Korupcija_ 22nd November is just last 2022 date if they want raid this year
[1:36:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 50% buff could come 4 weeks before prepatch
[1:36:22] CritcobainTV: @almostdps prepatch
[1:36:33] ArroArroArro: am I the only one here hopeing DF doesnt release this year?
[1:36:36] Vanhoek: Pretty sure fresh will be up at prepatch thats the whole point of the 50% xp buff
[1:37:07] CritcobainTV: @ArroArroArro They already said it's launching this year though
[1:37:11] cabalish: @ArroArroArro it depends how far they internaly, we will see
[1:37:24] raye_gaming22: it will be like nathria we will raid on chrismas
[1:37:30] CritcobainTV: @ArroArroArro when you look at the preorder underneath in fine print it says "on or before dec 31 2022

[1:37:46] Korupcija_: tell blizzard we want xp boost for retail too
[1:37:52] Korupcija_: in prepatch
[1:37:57] Vanhoek: Seems like with ff14 releasing their new patch to the expansion in july I feel blizz will try to match that with the hype of prepatch and have a 6 week prepatch giving us a aug 30th release
[1:38:40] ArroArroArro: @Critcobain  Yes I know they said that, they also did that with Warcraft Reforged, but they still delayed taht to late january the year after. So there is hope
[1:38:48] kelnyolo: who cares about grinding in the prepatch... do ya remember how fun it was to get the zombie debuff from crates and transforming others in zombies too? it was even possible to chat xfation while in zombie form
[1:39:26] ArroArroArro: they nerfed the wotlk leveling?
[1:39:33] ArroArroArro: or TBC?

[1:41:50] Firefost10: I feel like more people are hyped for wotlk than dragonthing
[1:42:26] Vanhoek: @cl_ogar0 Correct
[1:42:44] Vanhoek: @Towelliee see that benediction has hit over 30k in population?
[1:42:48] silodin: I thought i heard the red october theme song lmao
[1:42:50] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @silodin you okay buddy?
[1:42:53] clint_beastwood87: advice to new wrath players. Do all the quests,dont skip anything. Dont be like me,i had to kill mobs  for from 78-80 for the very first time.

[1:43:58] cl_ogar0: @clint_beastwood87 bruh
[1:44:00] Vanhoek: @clint_beastwood87 its gonna be all about the dungeon cleave than quest at 80
[1:44:25] iamsnaps: im 53 and just coming back to wow for WOTLK, right where i stopped playing . :D
[1:44:42] silodin: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight nah, wrath hype got me silly
[1:44:44] cl_ogar0: if i had choice i would just dungeon grind anyway. You can technically skip all quests in wotlk and just do hodir chain, and maybe rep unlocks so you can do heroics later
[1:44:47] clint_beastwood87: @Vanhoek it was different back then,we were all noobs,no group finders,dungeons were difficult to find and stuff like that
[1:45:13] Nico_vdM: LUL I remember in Dragonblight you had to kill an elite on a rhino. He had a quick respawn and would be back up before you could loot and mount to gtfo
[1:45:30] Nico_vdM: Or perhaps it was Borean Tundra
[1:45:35] cl_ogar0: but thats pretty bad gold / h
[1:45:45] cl_ogar0: unless yo udo like enchanting
[1:45:49] cl_ogar0: while you are at it

[1:46:19] cl_ogar0: PepegaCredit
[1:46:30] keyboardturner: China client
[1:46:48] cl_ogar0: flipping glyphs on AH yep
[1:46:50] fkinthiccbro: if they put it in, classic is gonna die prolly
[1:46:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the Classic tokens are just for China, I'd bet
[1:47:08] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: P2W EZ Clap
[1:47:12] kmalih: gdkp is great, anyone can get bis
[1:47:13] almostdps: @fkinthiccbro i mean classic already buys shitloads of gold, is blizz supporting that gonna make things worse?
[1:47:23] cl_ogar0: i made like 20k gold on last priv wotlk server just doing glyphs. But the competition is insane
[1:47:27] Korupcija_: one day mythic raids will be so easy that GDKP comes to retail
[1:47:27] keyboardturner: Though the interface export does also export some retail stuff by accident too so it wouldn't surprise me it's "leaking" over but it's not always the case
[1:47:31] NooDozz: NooDozz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:47:36] cl_ogar0: even funnier when your competitors are in your guild too
[1:47:45] cl_ogar0: yeah
[1:47:47] PvtHudson093: think so
[1:47:52] bigoldmeatpie: 78 or 80?
[1:47:59] Vanhoek: @Towelliee Think they will come out with the RaF mount for wrath that two seater flying mount? lol
[1:48:10] iamsnaps: any ETA when wotlk will drop ?
[1:48:18] silodin: How did you move the player and target frame without addons?
[1:48:25] cl_ogar0: if you can get something like minor glyph of thunderstorm early, or mend pet and other minor you can absolutely get loaded with money
[1:48:26] keyboardturner: iirc some of the Garrison code is in the classic interface files but that doesn't mean we have garrisons
[1:48:29] cl_ogar0: but thats RNG
[1:48:32] ChrisMFCook: What up @Towelliee hows Beta?

[1:49:00] daxstyle120: is there Random group finder in wrath? or did that come in cata?
[1:49:14] silodin: Maby we are the jailer 0_0
[1:49:15] TheCliffyShow: Brann is best Bronzebeard.
[1:49:18] fkinthiccbro: @almostdps i mean, people will prolly go back to private servers if that happens and the amout of ppl is gonna split again
[1:49:19] cl_ogar0: @daxstyle120 there is
[1:49:44] Vanhoek: @daxstyle120 No but they did bring in the LFG tool from retail to help find group no auto que
[1:49:47] Aquadriel: to think that everything in wrath was all because of the Jailer's doing Kapap
[1:49:57] George2001k: If the entire Shadowlands was N’zoth’s doong I would be very upset
[1:50:21] cl_ogar0: @Vanhoek wym? i dont remember exactly, wasnt dungeon finder like 3.3 feature
[1:50:21] George2001k: Doing too
[1:50:21] TheCliffyShow: @Aquadriel Not everything. I'm sure he wasn't involved in the Yogg-Saron stuff.
[1:50:26] Vanhoek: @Towelliee Staying on Pagle for wrath?
[1:50:34] Rayman_1990: @daxstyle120 it came at the end of the original wotlk, for now blizz dont plan to include it to wotlk re release
[1:50:41] cl_ogar0: oh
[1:50:43] Nico_vdM: Wasnt he north edge of Storm Peaks?
[1:50:43] cl_ogar0: big if true
[1:50:52] Vanhoek: @cl_ogar0 Yeah it came in at ICC patch but they have already said they are not putting it in at all.
[1:50:57] H0lyt0ny: @Towelliee Unrelated question, are the DT 1990's worth it over the 990's?
[1:51:00] TommySeeker: there is a lot of t hings about earthen
[1:51:01] cl_ogar0: interesting choice
[1:51:01] Herzenliegen: @vanhoek No he's going to one of the fresh realms
[1:51:15] cl_ogar0: i dont hate it tho, might actually need to find decent people to grind heroics with
[1:51:17] Vanhoek: ah gotcha
[1:51:32] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Fresh for life
[1:51:45] Vanhoek: Just be prepared to be not accepted alot if you are a dps and dont have the gs

[1:53:15] H0lyt0ny: @cl_ogar0 same! that's what I have but I was wondering since he has the 1990
[1:53:45] cl_ogar0: @H0lyt0ny he problaby doesnt have comparisopn point just like we dont haha
[1:54:03] H0lyt0ny: @H0lyt0ny true haha
[1:54:10] cl_ogar0: hodir is the biggest pain point with wrath for me
[1:54:14] cl_ogar0: what a dogshit design choice
[1:54:23] cl_ogar0: i usually ended up getting pvp shoulder enchant
[1:54:24] almostdps: i think i saw one on the side of the cliff?
[1:54:24] Nico_vdM: From the map it can be anywhere in Storm Peaks
[1:54:27] cl_ogar0: and buying stones later
[1:54:38] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee when do you guess WotLK Classic will launch? I think early/mid August myself
[1:54:55] cl_ogar0: what is he looking for?

[1:55:02] Chuckforfun: Still no questhelper from blizzard in the Beta?
[1:55:18] RollDouble77: They are along the side of the cliff
[1:55:19] Nico_vdM: I remember back in the day there was an addon that attached a window to the quest log that loaded the comments for the quest you had selected. Made questing easier
[1:55:25] Nico_vdM: I just cannot remember the name
[1:55:39] Nico_vdM: the comments from wowhead

[1:56:01] cl_ogar0: bruh majority of people are gonna roll with the speedrun addon that just gives you huge arrow lmao
[1:56:57] Nico_vdM: Top comment: The earth is on the cliff facing north just below where the Stormforged Reavers and Dolomite Giants are fighting. I found just one earth per ledge, thus I had to hop on and off my flying mount a lot. The general location is 27,33. Just travel up and down to get all your earth. The earthen mining pick works fine, all you have to do is right click on the earth.
[1:57:07] cykaslaya95: That's a tree stump
[1:57:19] Kize_Gaming: those are tree stumps
[1:57:36] Rayman_1990: As a world pvp fan, I wish there was an addon which shows huge arrow to the nearest enemy player Kappa
[1:57:45] Vanhoek: Zygor and rested xp are really good they give you that overlay unlike questy
[1:57:46] almostdps: one of the comments says you need the frostweave to be able to mine

[1:59:44] Nico_vdM: @Towelliee on the retail version of wowhead there is a video of the location
[2:00:10] RollDouble77: They are along the side off the cliff, not at the top
[2:00:31] ArroArroArro: 6
[2:00:50] ArroArroArro: treestump
[2:01:00] Vanhoek: @Towelliee Have you dont the ampitheater of pain quest?
[2:01:10] Vanhoek: done*
[2:01:13] Herzenliegen: That quest is going to be fun on a high realm.
[2:01:13] Ratwar: wait is flying in nordend instantly
[2:01:16] ArroArroArro: its exactly the same, no clue man,  just meem-ing

[2:01:35] mangoboi: hey @Towelliee with the enchanting vellums coming in wotlk, will enchanters be able to sell ring enchants? or are they still profession specific
[2:01:53] Vanhoek: No ring enchants are proff specific
[2:01:55] ProfessorChaoos: think he means unlocked right away
[2:02:04] Vanhoek: Flying unlocked at 77
[2:02:10] Rudric_Ice: is this game different than retail northrend ?
[2:02:32] Vanhoek: No same in retail other than mob levels
[2:02:33] ArroArroArro: thats a good question , can you buy frost flying instantly?
[2:02:38] Nico_vdM: Dont cloth only drop from humanoids?
[2:02:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Humanoids are good for cloth, usually
[2:02:43] NooDozz: think you want to kill humanoids for close
[2:02:45] NooDozz: cloth
[2:02:46] Nico_vdM: and not mechanicals
[2:03:10] geokouts: you could kill some harpies arler
[2:03:15] Vanhoek: at 77 you can train flying than at 80 you can get the BoA flying for alts which allows them to fly right away
[2:03:31] ArroArroArro: I thought frost flying was only unlocked lvl 78 for like 2k gold
[2:03:40] Vanhoek: 1k
[2:03:41] Nico_vdM: 1k gold
[2:03:44] ArroArroArro: oo right okey thanks
[2:03:47] Rottencoarse: the BoA is 1k gold @Towelliee
[2:03:47] Bayne77: $1
[2:03:53] Vanhoek: cold weather flying is 1k

[2:04:26] Vanhoek: atleast the normal flyer is 150
[2:04:38] Vanhoek: so wont be too bad if you have to normal fly a bit
[2:04:50] Dystilled: From memory you make just about what you need. Theres not much grinding to afford the basics
[2:05:16] Bayne77: no bullshit
[2:05:20] Herzenliegen: @weirdo_dude the book is 1k
[2:05:25] Rudric_Ice: 2k gold back then is 200k gold nowadays
[2:05:32] ArroArroArro: welll, gold was hard to come by for many. 5k gold in tbc for that stuff was alot for me
[2:05:35] poisonjoe: back in like MoP people demanded to remove flying and that was the compromise
[2:06:03] TorrentzX: easiest wow token sales of their life
[2:06:06] Dystilled: Vanilla was fun, celebrating when you finally got 100g for mount
[2:06:15] Vanhoek: With GDKPs gold is pretty easy to make and im sure the fresh servers will have many of them
[2:06:20] Nico_vdM: I dont understand the "remove flying". If you dont want to fly, dont. Leave me out of it
[2:06:49] silodin: demanding to remove PI? who wants that lmao
[2:06:50] michaisn: whats ur gs xD
[2:06:51] geros2013: yeah and then people they would cry I dont have 200k gold. How there are people without gold in retail wow is beyond me.

[2:14:09] Lycam: @Towelliee Had they done Torgast right, it'd have been incredible grind.
[2:14:12] AureliusXV: it's soft
[2:14:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Preach said it right when he said "hard" content should be made for the top 25%
[2:14:27] ArroArroArro: MAKE FUN STUFF FOR EVERYONE! dont count on the raid and m+  to be your only content

[2:14:44] AureliusXV: just make the raid easy and fun
[2:14:45] Dystilled: With how wow subs have dipped over the years, I think theyve taken the attitude of "Look after those that have played for years to raid" and offer less to the casual checking out the game
[2:15:12] prckoxdee: What i don't get is ppl cryed why do i have to endlessly farm AP, and now all of a sudden AP is fine ?
[2:15:13] Syllvn: Just put an extra achieve for clearing in Month one, then let them nerf shit
[2:15:19] Korupcija_: true, wow has like 100k subs nowdays
[2:15:20] Zeradicated: I cannot see your average Mythic raiding guild spending 50k $ for WoW tokens either
[2:15:27] geros2013: I think the ICC way is the best way to deal with this issue tbh
[2:15:38] Jakosin: @Korupcija_ wheres that info posted?
[2:15:42] dracullus: @wEiRdO_dUdE same Preach who were praising that old raids were unbeatable for weeks? this people say different shit every year
[2:15:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard is nerfing Sepulcher again this week, for like the 10th time, and it's still not enough
[2:15:52] CaveDwellerDonOG: I actually quit playing WoW after the drop of Pandaria and the removal of my skill trees and creativity of builds. Cata raids were too easy as well and it removed most of the fun from the game
[2:15:54] DevilSpire: so LFR should be super easy but people still wipe on hulondrous at 0%.......
[2:15:56] Aquadriel: ok last bit of that take is also braindead

[2:16:19] tricky_86: Is it a problem though? Who cares if its hard for them, then nerfed for us. Just don't see an issue. The problem with SoFO is that they just under nerfed at first.
[2:16:26] Cafe0le: jdotb GIGACHAD
[2:16:26] Jakosin: @Korupcija_ atpCap
[2:16:30] jerseyfive: monkey needs shiny things that other monkey dont have
[2:16:31] BuddySinister: Thats pretty funny
[2:16:48] raye_gaming22: cuz M+ is dogshit side content we raider are foersed to grind for trinkets and we dont like it
[2:16:50] George2001k: SD needs an other nerf! F the 3rd boss…
[2:16:56] AureliusXV: all these people think they have a platform ppl care what they think
[2:16:57] raye_gaming22: the more it gets guttedthe better
[2:16:57] lim3lit3z: whats so bad about world first being over quick?
[2:17:02] mrrazputin: But noone care about world first race
[2:17:03] almostdps: if sofo released with its currently difficulty i think its a 5 day raid lol
[2:17:04] Rudric_Ice: who cares about RWF
[2:17:07] TorrentzX: yeah its interesting. I think it's because if m+ gets nerfed it just means the best players can push higher score etc. But if you nerf a raid the top raiders cant get more successful since they already killed all the bosses
[2:17:09] Lamyth: I do think World first should be over in a week
[2:17:15] silodin: I collect battle pets :)
[2:17:16] geros2013: Jb just hit again btw
[2:17:28] almostdps: @mrrazputin WF raid gets the biggest viewership/most interest of anything in WoW outside expansion launch
[2:17:34] Korupcija_: wow respecting your time = bad, final fantasy respecting your time = good
[2:17:39] szble: everybody bitches about any grinds though
[2:17:39] Rudric_Ice: blizzard making WoW an esports game made IT SHIT
[2:17:41] Dillhouse: i agree, i feel like i run the same dungeons over and over to get max level and then in order to gear, i have to run the same dungeons again but mythic lol
[2:17:41] jclester: @silodin A fellow man of culture
[2:17:45] Jakosin: @Korupcija_ sounds a bit low
[2:18:13] TorrentzX: based take
[2:18:14] PvtHudson093: we had sockets on every piece of gear
[2:18:20] keyboardturner: isn't that just borrowed power
[2:18:27] dracullus: so they will nerf mythic so it will tuned for world first first weeks, then for rest, what is exactly the problem?
[2:18:38] Visinatrix: and method
[2:18:38] toucans46: YEah but they arent making this game for the RWF people its for everyone
[2:18:39] Zettabyte: #GetGood @Towelliee Kappa
[2:18:44] Thdlock: bring back AP
[2:18:48] tricky_86: Just go the Ice Crown route. Give a buff that you can turn off if you think you're a mega gamer lol
[2:18:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Does everyone have access to the  World First addons? It's stilly
[2:19:00] Rudric_Ice: @Thdlock  no ty
[2:19:06] almostdps: @Thdlock gachiHYPER
[2:19:20] milorgpvp: @Towelliee its funny how they clear the raid "so much faster than most people", but the point thats never brought up is that they litteraly have the same gear/ilvl 2 weeks in that it takes most guilds months to get.
[2:19:29] geros2013: ICC aura
[2:19:35] girthyderps: I loved the difficulty of sofo, but I 100% agree that (we) should've had the ability to 'out-gear' the content. I guess I'm saying I'd rather out-gear it, than have it nerfed.
[2:19:39] Zettabyte: lulaBurp
[2:19:52] agoosegame: i hate the questing in shadowlands compared to legion. bfa was a fever dream i cant remember anything from that shit. although this is coming from someone who stopped raiding in legion.
[2:19:52] dracullus: yeah, optional buff would be best
[2:20:18] Dystilled: I actually liked the ICC buff idea. We went in and cleared some bosses for gear. Turned off when we wanted to do progression. Was never an issue
[2:20:22] keyboardturner: I think that was the intention of tier / double legendary this season, no?
[2:20:26] dracullus: and elite title for beating raid without buff instead top 100
[2:20:38] Rudric_Ice: maybe thats why they are trying to bring back talent trees cuz of no borrowed power ?
[2:20:49] keyboardturner: tier gear was distributed very slowly at the beginning and then now you can just get a full set without issue
[2:20:55] Endy253: How prot leveling feel?
[2:20:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: HaxzorJimDuggan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[2:21:02] TommySeeker: Do you think Blizzard could try to do a raid tier that's easy kind of like SFO is now see if the community prefers that
[2:21:05] dalcala1789: is wrath out for beta?
[2:21:06] Korupcija_: raids are too complex now, dmg buff could just fuck everything up
[2:21:30] smashwow: this tier was just fucked from the beginning
[2:21:40] geros2013: lol I love THD mentioned they nerfed Anduin because only 2 guilds could kill him week 1. And I am like dude you only killed him week 1 because he was bugged to smitherins
[2:21:44] smashwow: sub 500
[2:21:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's less than 500
[2:21:56] milorgpvp: @Towelliee just look at the gear difference on the early bosses. Echo first vigilant guardian kill march 10th - avg ilvl 262 - 18x4piece, my guild march 21st, avg ilvl 260 4x4piece. We get Ce every tier the past years
[2:21:58] Kale_Nd: 422
[2:22:14] Korupcija_: everyone that is on Jailer now will kill it
[2:22:30] SavageCheez: On all skill levels, or just Mythic?
[2:22:34] TommySeeker: Bosses now are so intricate now that having more dps makes such a big difference because you can skip all the very intricate combos that happens throughout a longer fight
[2:22:34] Moobot: 🐲 S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. 🐲
[2:22:36] Aquadriel: @Towelliee blizzard got themselves into this problem by acknowledging and 'promoting' the RWF, so they do some tunning around that. They were better of when they did not show interest on it, imo.
[2:22:37] prckoxdee: as long as they treat wow as an esport its going to suck :)
[2:22:40] Bernardo994: this is the only expansion where i left the game with green weapons while everything else was epic
[2:22:44] TommySeeker: there is a lot less to learn about a boss if you have a lot of dps
[2:22:47] geros2013: If they are still raiding @Korupcija_ a lot of guilds died at that point
[2:22:47] squidward_tentacles33: squidward_tentacles33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! pugWoo towHAMUP
[2:22:59] Bernardo994: just want this over
[2:23:02] N3llee: "giga nerf" i like it
[2:23:08] smashwow: the post-pre-post-post-pre-giga-chad-x-factor nerf LUL
[2:23:31] smashwow: when you got that going on there's a problem.
[2:23:33] neugassh: its pretty sad more people raid sunwell than spelucher KEKW
[2:23:38] NooDozz: I havent played retail in years...I wish the game went back to how tbc/wotlk is set up.
[2:23:45] GTmask: GTmask subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! Soon. 4 years. Soon.
[2:23:49] Mecabeast: im thinking they just dont have the difficulty where they want it for s4
[2:23:59] milorgpvp: hard agree
[2:23:59] Aquadriel: @Towelliee blizzard got themselves into this problem by acknowledging and 'promoting' the RWF, so they do some tunning around that. They were better of when they did not show interest on it, imo.
[2:24:12] ceranac23: they will undertune raid probably

[2:24:20] almostdps: @neugassh i mean its 15 year old solved content and M+ is just straight up better for loot for the majority of the retail population
[2:24:39] RollDouble77: Maybe with the 100 new hires at Bliz, they will do more internal testing
[2:24:39] markco_wins: why not just make it doable without nerfs, by 50%+ of guilds at the start
[2:24:47] Dizmal: or give us that crucibel from the start?
[2:24:53] milorgpvp: @Towelliee were just playing 2 wastly different games. If you spread out the amount of hours raided between a WF guild like WR 700-1k, they probably end up with roughly the same pull count and hours commited .the difference is just knowledge and across how long of a timespan those hours are commited.
[2:24:59] mizerboy: I'm not
[2:25:00] Shadowlemur01: for the most part
[2:25:02] almostdps: i never minded borrowed power tbh
[2:25:04] silodin: i never minded warforging
[2:25:13] mizerboy: I liked WF/TF

[2:25:17] Syllvn: I miss Warforging etc, was always fun
[2:25:22] neugassh: @neugassh retail raids are less fun thats all
[2:25:25] geros2013: if they do that 2pc thing though. WF guilds will giga farm 4pc and faceroll the raid in 4 days. And then watch everyone cry about how easy it is
[2:25:36] TorrentzX: RWF should hast 4 days
[2:25:38] Aquadriel: I liked it, it made the game goal oriented every patch and gave me more things to do, therefore justifying my monthly fee @Towelliee
[2:25:38] TorrentzX: last
[2:25:38] silodin: i'll take WF over random sockets/leech anyyyy day
[2:25:45] Syllvn: Raids/Dungeons dropping fuck all loot made me stop playing, it was boring.
[2:25:48] Hypertitan: i don't see a problem with rwf lasting 10 days...no more tho
[2:25:50] Dystilled: before all that was even added, raiding was pretty good. Its like theyve lost touch with being able to tune without some random power mechanic to hand hold
[2:26:09] Kinghorn: good morning everyone seagHEY
[2:26:21] N3llee: I feel like if there was a way to solve the split raids that alone would have a difficulty impact in the RWF right off the bat.
[2:26:33] Zeradicated: Attempts made people to train bosses with alt raids
[2:26:35] fkinthiccbro: for me it's not really that it's hard, the thing is, if you dont have milions of gold ready at launch and a guild to prog with the same mindset, you can't even compete with it
[2:26:47] MOLAR305: i remember when Vael had a 6 hour lockout if yoiu didnt kill him in the first hour
[2:27:14] Kinghorn: the gifts are in the little town on the right
[2:27:25] Kinghorn: yeah
[2:27:55] Shadowlemur01: Thats what happened to my guild
[2:28:20] CritcobainTV: I stopped raiding because I couldn't find a decent guild to even clear heroic. Was just such a shit show
[2:28:35] RustproofSage: cause its not worth the time/moneys investment
[2:28:45] SaDos: the pussy mentality
[2:28:46] CritcobainTV: I don't care enough anymore to put that type of time into it
[2:29:02] raye_gaming22: wr 500 guilds are not the most skilled players to say it polite  there is a huge diffrence
[2:29:05] CritcobainTV: @SaDos LUL not quite
[2:29:11] Necrom93: @gedehams_goathams Closer to vanilla imo, but smoother
[2:29:12] Mayhem_George: @gedehams_goathams more like classic
[2:29:27] Zhiovanni: A lot of it will be to counter how hard we will be scaling in S4 as well
[2:29:29] Bernardo994: but should a games be at 200 to 300 tries to beat?
[2:29:34] Mayhem_George: *vanilla ye
[2:29:34] almostdps: sofo is gonna be the easiest raid in s4 at this rate lol
[2:29:46] neugassh: wotlk is closer to retail..its much more "spammy"
[2:29:46] TheNoobTaurenDruid: So SK Pieces it's in for WF next expansion+
[2:29:49] TheNoobTaurenDruid: ?
[2:29:52] SaDos: @Critcobain i guess im the only one who thinks that the hardest content should be hard
[2:29:55] TheNoobTaurenDruid: not*
[2:29:57] Kinghorn: yeah I need to find out of if my retail guild is still raiding LUL see if I can sneak into a heroic jailer run
[2:30:07] Kinghorn: been playing classic so long they probably forgot me
[2:30:40] Hood______: idk why they don't just create a curated space for wf raiders like they do with m+
[2:30:42] Rudric_Ice: remove normal bcuz its more like heroic difficulty nowadays
[2:30:47] ArroArroArro: remove gear from mythic, cap gear at heroic lvl  and make mythic a prestige thing only, maybe a mount or title or transmog
[2:30:50] CritcobainTV: @SaDos Should be diffcult? yeah, but when the best guilds in the world take multiple weeks to do it playing like 16+ hours a day,  and your guild is average, i dont see that as a "pussy mentality"
[2:30:51] Phractured: it would be cool to watch ultimate mode.. but realistically a waste of resources because there wont be enough participation
[2:30:52] CalRipps: <3
[2:31:06] TylordKY: they should never nurf mythic and it will be all good
[2:31:18] Tehcooky: if 5 difficulties is too much, remove LFR, normal is sometimes even easier xD
[2:31:35] neugassh: max raid difficulty should be like was in cata or mop
[2:31:36] Aidler: Aidler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months, currently on a 58 month streak! 
[2:31:36] Kinghorn: I love THD, cull the weak!
[2:31:37] Rudric_Ice: rename Normal to LFR and remove normal mode
[2:31:37] BUFFEGIRL: yea FUCK casual players
[2:31:41] TorrentzX: na its a bad take lmao in my honest opinion
[2:31:47] schl0nk: LUL
[2:31:48] L4nds1ide: get rid of the weak people dident they quit the last world first
[2:31:50] Dystilled: The "weak" people are the ones who fund development of the game
[2:31:51] TorrentzX: time played does not equal skill
[2:31:57] Jimmyturbo: <200k people doing raids better buff it
[2:31:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Making the game so hard that a lot of people quit is not good business
[2:32:01] Frank4LuLz: world is to woke right now , too woke
[2:32:01] TorrentzX: but i digress
[2:32:02] Secondbreakfasttt: sucha idiot take
[2:32:04] birdiedogbro: imagine they got rid of LFG for a week and u had to form in general chat
[2:32:06] Aquadriel: yeah you cant say that shit on this day and age
[2:32:08] SaDos: @Critcobain it takes them so long because they dont have optimal gear.. they already play at a disadvantage.. people now are 277ilvl and if they are not they suck
[2:32:10] cykaslaya95: Get rid of the weaklings EZ
[2:32:15] geros2013: @Towelliee he doubled down and said getting into normal and heroic raids should be harder not just mythic.
[2:32:26] Thdlock: @geros2013, that is incorrect bud
[2:32:31] Mecabeast: basically if we had visions which was another route to get max level gear itd be better
[2:32:32] Aervyper: @Towelliee can always go grind Diablo Immortal F2P
[2:32:32] Thdlock: dont take my words and skew them geros

[2:33:26] Kinghorn: give this man some AP
[2:33:32] Secondbreakfasttt: grind your pets weekling @Thdlock
[2:33:48] Thdlock: @mellkorrrrr, lol i have every pet battle acheive that isnt ppv
[2:33:52] Rudric_Ice: thd can grind when Legion classic launches
[2:34:01] NieIas: John KEKW
[2:34:01] belaham: To much free time without the grind
[2:34:04] Rehctv: Go to the gym/touch grass
[2:34:04] ArroArroArro: Make the grinds none power related though, fuck torghast and ap grind for power to be able to raid
[2:34:06] SaDos: do it now before i go to work
[2:34:14] Carsenpai: @towelliee this is my first patch playing, what will happen to our tier on dragon release? Should I find replacements in case they brick tier on release of the next expac?
[2:34:15] Dystilled: Its why everquest raiding is pretty much reserved for the most devoted. Games with that much grind for succession just dont work in this day and age

[2:34:18] Jagmas: Jagmas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 125 months, currently on a 125 month streak! Blizzard not ending my streak!!
[2:34:24] Hypertitan: some cool open world content might help that...but I honestly have no clue what that would look like
[2:34:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Touch grass, get ticks LUL
[2:34:46] DevilSpire: usually
[2:34:51] Aquadriel: mythic tier should be useful up to lvl one lvl before max lvl
[2:34:51] ArroArroArro: if I remember correctly 14 years ago, tier gear lasts untill 72
[2:34:54] PvtHudson093: i reckon till about level 65 teir will work
[2:35:02] Varsader: The only real answer to downtime in Wrath is to hang out with the tuskarr
[2:35:09] demon_bishop: @Towelliee Teir should be fine for 1-3 long as they dont deactivate the set bonuses like before
[2:35:19] neugassh: they should forget the timegating and just make some fun content to do
[2:35:28] Kinghorn: cant wait to fish that fountain Varsader
[2:35:29] legendaryvira: @Towelliee use ur speed buff when flying 300% mount speed
[2:35:40] Tomykoks: what wow playlist are you currently listening to?
[2:35:51] Carsenpai: Okay sweet, Ty :)
[2:35:53] Aquadriel: @Towelliee some new talents have the sofo tier bonus baked in, so they might as well remove them from the get-go, to not overlap.
[2:35:58] Ciupe: have you checked if Quel'Danas daily quests give exp on Beta? If so we can prepare them for turn ins for exp boost @Towelliee
[2:36:03] Rudric_Ice: at the end of the day u can't never satisfy all of the WoW playerbase
[2:36:05] Dystilled: Epics from previous expacs usually last a good 2 levels minimum. Youre good for a few levels with tier minimum
[2:36:17] Dr_Fumbles_: is this the last classic they are doing? i know its based on opinion, but cat considered the downfall
[2:36:23] squiffyk: anyone know what classic server towelliee plays on
[2:36:25] legendaryvira: @Towelliee do you see @hybridsteve at all now?
[2:36:30] Tomykoks: @Towelliee what wow playlist are you currently listening to?
[2:36:38] Ciupe: @squiffyk its wotlk beta
[2:36:45] Dystilled: Unpopular opinion but I liked cata... some of the most fun ive had raiding
[2:36:56] Kinghorn: it was azuresong but I think he transferred off squiffyk
[2:37:05] BUFFEGIRL: its a triple A company ofc they have to cater to everyones needs
[2:37:08] Kinghorn: not sure his server now
[2:37:09] Vanhoek: most people liked cata LFR gave it a bad name
[2:37:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Cata, WOD, Legion were the best raiding times
[2:37:13] riley_poker: I don't care if they satisfy everyone as long as they satisfy me Keepo
[2:37:29] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: BASED
[2:37:48] Necrom93: @Dystilled I agree... except for Dragon Soul

[2:38:06] Tomykoks: @Towelliee what wow playlist are you currently listening to?
[2:38:13] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP
[2:38:18] Kinghorn: I am next up on 4 items in sunwell, just need them to drop coxRee
[2:38:22] TheNoobTaurenDruid: 15 boss raid?
[2:38:24] TheNoobTaurenDruid: :P
[2:38:29] phattboi_80: or if they do 11 bosses please lessen the trash
[2:38:32] riley_poker: I do wish they would slow down end game gearing though. spend a bunch of time to max out a toon and then get 25ilvl after like 2  hours
[2:38:33] Necrom93: @Dystilled I quit my guild because of that raid LUL
[2:38:48] aussie_pleb: Most people prefer to point out themselfves more impressive it’s human nature
[2:38:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 7-10 bosses is optimal
[2:39:00] Dystilled: @Necrom93 people falling off spine was just hilarious to me
[2:39:09] seedwest1987: I want to play WoTLK when it comes out but I dont have a classic character, when would be best to start levelling will be most quick?
[2:39:13] BigSteveGamingUK: the biggest thing i want i for them to stop gating all the content
[2:39:36] CrazyKazooie: Man I miss wow, just waiting for dragonflight though.
[2:39:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Blizzard also has the entire wow soundtrack on spotify as a playlist @Towelliee
[2:39:38] Kinghorn: the time gating?
[2:39:41] Phractured: @seedwest1987 get the boost and start at 70
[2:39:57] Phractured: or start a dk at 55
[2:39:59] Wildsmasher: Wildsmasher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[2:40:03] Kinghorn: yeah if they dont time gate it people will run out of shit quick
[2:40:06] seedwest1987: not wanting to boost
[2:40:07] Dystilled: Only bad gating is "Pay $15 to access this raid"
[2:40:07] Necrom93: @Dystilled Even though I hated healing that fight, I agree with you. Deathwing yeeting people was hilarious.
[2:40:07] Syllvn: Gating is always needed, just has to be done right
[2:40:14] Kinghorn: ^
[2:40:20] smashwow: i'm sure blizz could figure out a way to gate it
[2:40:20] Enkrux: If you dont have enough content and are forced to gate....ding ding fix it
[2:40:21] Vanhoek: Thats fine if people play all the content and finish it they go play other games like ff14 its dumb that wow holds their player base prisoner with gated content
[2:40:26] Gale40: only one level gainable per week 😃
[2:40:40] Kinghorn: Sir_Gale coxStare
[2:40:50] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59peCzICqRHimd57hJxTZz?si=41c56563641a4e77 heres the entire wow soundtrack playlist, Official Blizzard playlist with vanilla-Zereth Mortis music
[2:40:52] Gale40: Stare
[2:40:55] raye_gaming22: @Towelliee they talked about extra talent pionts those are maybe the gate and raid nerf over time
[2:40:58] silodin: That's me :)
[2:41:09] Dystilled: I actually enjoyed back in the day getting keyed for raids. Helping guildies get keyed for rag etc
[2:41:09] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:41:10] xeridan1: Leaving out LFD in Wotlk is artificially gating it too via making emblems limited to 1 daily heroic per dungeon
[2:41:12] Rudric_Ice: then go play something else :)
[2:41:19] xeridan1: They know what theyre doing
[2:41:28] geokouts: so many WoW players are Patrick that ate the chocolate and accused SPongebob of eating his :P
[2:41:29] jexx1337: @Vanhoek But then people wouldnt subscribe for more than liek couple weeks. This is still business in the end
[2:41:30] BigSteveGamingUK: gate some content thats fine just not as much as they have been, especially solo stuff that isnt really end game power
[2:41:33] Kinghorn: there are other games that are not WoW
[2:41:37] Kinghorn: shocking I know
[2:41:48] Vanhoek: @xeridan1 what? Each boss in a heroic will drop a badge lol and raids will drop badges too
[2:41:54] smashwow: i feel like if they give us 60hrs of content ungated and someone does that in a weekend. that's just like a normal SP game. that's on them not the dev team
[2:42:03] Dystilled: I would argue though, theres not another game that is like WoW. Thats a big appeal for some
[2:42:07] geros2013: lol I remember when Ion said its ok to be done with a patch during legion he was crucified. When FF said it he was a hero.
[2:42:07] CrazyKazooie: lol playing FF14 rn, but just waiting on dragonflight
[2:42:24] xeridan1: @Vanhoek Yes, but spamming LFD got you past lockouts
[2:42:28] Vanhoek: @jexx1337 thats not how the player base works people play ff14 and still sub to it in its down time
[2:42:30] xeridan1: For more badges
[2:42:43] Enkrux: So then its a community issue...cause yall just like to bitch xD
[2:42:48] mon3yb: well then there should be evergreen content seperate from transmog farming
[2:43:00] BigSteveGamingUK: is it really the job of game devs now to tell us how much when should/shouldnt be playing each day/week?
[2:43:02] Vanhoek: @xeridan1 sure but bosses never dropped badges you only got 1 from the que
[2:43:13] ijuki: Was heroics daily lockouts in wrath?
[2:43:19] Kinghorn: someone else is doing the quest

[2:43:20] Kinghorn: yup
[2:43:49] jexx1337: @Vanhoek FF14 gates content what are you talking about. What about the raids released on a certain schedule. Or the max tombstone per weeks. You're just bashing on WoW because thats what everyone does
[2:43:53] xeridan1: Correct
[2:43:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: it didnt exist until the ICC patch didnt it?
[2:44:00] ijuki: F wrath classic then DansGame
[2:44:16] xeridan1: wrath is gonna be a lot worse this time around

[2:45:27] ijuki: @Kinghorn I know, I liked it, but the other ones the group didn't
[2:45:33] raye_gaming22: hes the goat of gaming
[2:45:38] Jakosin: LMAO
[2:45:48] Jakosin: xiv is super gated atpCap
[2:45:49] smokingcactus: I have a feeling wrath classic is going to be least popular than even tbc. the classic scene is too meh.
[2:45:58] Aervyper: @Towelliee i think the vision behind EQ: Next was the right idea. It likely was impossible to do but it was an amazing concept with the living world idea
[2:45:59] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: FF14 fans GTFO :)
[2:46:11] NieIas: :)
[2:46:23] Kinghorn: corgi mount in WoW when
[2:46:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: imagine if new characters had to complete the story of all expansions to reach the new content
[2:46:30] NooDozz: laughing in FF14
[2:46:56] r3d04: wrath was fckn amazing!
[2:46:56] CrazyKazooie: LUL
[2:46:57] mon3yb: I do like the gating of FF14 a bit better though. You can finish the story content until the next patch in one go
[2:47:08] Zeradicated: @smokingcactus TBC had growing numbers in players. WoTLK got more nostalgia for people + Wrath is the most popular in private server scene
[2:47:13] Jakosin: I raided the most in Wotlk
[2:47:13] Shadowlemur01: @Towelliee do they stop at wrath classic/
[2:47:17] mon3yb: and relic weapons can be farmed ad nauseum
[2:47:21] yankerzzz: do we have a release date for wrath yet? some people were saying aug 1st?
[2:47:25] Rayman_1990: @HaxzorJimDuggan could be rly cool if wow was a single player game
[2:47:26] Kinghorn: coxSeafood coxWiggle
[2:47:27] Dr_Fumbles_: i just remember making mad money mining during woltk
[2:47:27] BlewGamingGroup: itll be good for a couple of months . then people will find other things to do until ICC
[2:47:29] Vanhoek: TBC's downfall was they left p1 for far too long
[2:47:32] CrazyKazooie: Don't want to ruin the feeling of wrath from the beginning so won't play it because of that
[2:47:47] Vanhoek: lost a ton of subs because raids were hella boring.
[2:47:52] smokingcactus: @zeradicated only cuz there is nothing to do in retail and people refuse to move on from wow and try other games
[2:48:14] Lightninghandz: @Kazoojin Wont ever have sex again, what if its not ever as good. This logic. lol
[2:48:35] jarilrpg: @Biby07 same
[2:48:36] Korupcija_: #no
[2:48:37] neugassh: @Biby07 OMEGALUL
[2:48:46] Kinghorn: tghSpin
[2:48:48] BlewGamingGroup: a lot of people are saying fuck blizzard for not putting it in and just going to private servers that already have it
[2:48:50] Vanhoek: No LFD tool means no LFR tool if they do go Cata next
[2:49:04] Vanhoek: let them
[2:49:14] smokingcactus: @biby07 I know alot of people that way honestly.
[2:49:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: lfr didnt happen until the last raid anyway
[2:49:18] cerealkillas22: im fine with no LFD
[2:49:29] Bayne77: i think those have graduated to hammer of fuck yo anus
[2:49:29] Varsader: #BringBackTowellieeHammerofFuckYourFace
[2:49:32] riley_poker: I started during WOTLK and i really struggled to figure shit out. It was just so much more then any game I had played up until then.
[2:49:35] CrazyKazooie: @Lightninghandz lmao true, should probably of phrased it better :'D
[2:49:39] Rayman_1990: imagine not playing just because it takes a bit too longer to form a 5 man group
[2:49:39] cerealkillas22: Classic is always on the last patch though with all the balancing and usually all the features though
[2:50:03] Vanhoek: The onething I wished they did was have LFD for old content dungeons but leave current not que able
[2:50:06] cerealkillas22: loh?
[2:50:06] Rudric_Ice: wtf happened to #NoChanges ?
[2:50:10] asmodai4823: @Biby07 you clearly didnt play all of wrath then
[2:50:27] BlewGamingGroup: @Vanhoek if cata classic comes out .... i doubt they would have a 20% player retention from wrath
[2:50:38] Zeradicated: LFD was in ICC patch.
[2:50:48] geros2013: Towelliee getting carried by npc's
[2:50:52] silodin: World first valduran?!
[2:50:53] silodin: POG
[2:50:54] Vanhoek: @roadrrunnerr1 who knows people like player progression
[2:50:54] Kinghorn: EZ Clap
[2:50:59] Korupcija_: report a bug Kappa
[2:51:02] sh4d0wsky: NPC carry
[2:51:06] Rayman_1990: by the time original lfd arrived, a lot of ppl didnt even need 5 man dungeons at all
[2:51:08] riley_poker: LUL LUL LUL NPC for the win
[2:51:18] NooDozz: casual quester lol
[2:51:29] Timothious: LFD stopped some of the elitism folks had to deal with

[2:57:13] smokingcactus: @vanhoek I jumped between 2 guilds and still couldn't get help. I swear they was full of bots lol
[2:58:15] smokingcactus: just because my favorite expansion is MoP doesn't mean I want to re live it.

[3:12:07] noosphear: The decision in making a group that I made when I was playing DAoC was whether to go to the bar or play video games.  Today it is my kids yelling at me and ignoring them or playing video games.

[4:08:24] Connectus: PogChamp Arthas movie ? PogChamp
[4:08:28] Connectus: 3rd war let's go! PogChamp
[4:08:31] N3llee: Odd they are doing a reboot when the studio just auctioned off all the movie props not to long ago
[4:08:42] Aidler: can still take years and years
[4:08:59] Connectus: Genuinely I agree, just go full LotR on it
[4:09:08] Connectus: 3 long movies
[4:09:14] theDirtyon3: Jaina gonna get into the movie too prob
[4:09:14] toobaked1987: They should just do the Arthas storyline.
[4:09:22] Connectus: You can't fit WarCraft into 1 hour and 30 minutes
[4:09:32] Erielle04: I want an arthas series with henry cavil
[4:09:33] Kriven: arthas would be way better than thrall. Green jesus just is not that interesting
[4:09:59] Lasidor: GREEN JESUS was the man!
[4:10:02] Kriven: no i remember old school thrall he was boring
[4:10:03] portend: Old scholl Thrall is way more appealing
[4:10:07] theDirtyon3: old school thrall was a gladiator
[4:10:09] PvtHudson093: Praise be to Green Jesus
[4:10:11] Aidler: Netflix launches so much…. who knows
[4:10:13] Connectus: Old school Thrall was awesome
[4:10:24] N3llee: meh they will just change the story up again and ruin just for the film sake
[4:10:29] Connectus: @Kriven We're not talking about WoW Thrall, we're talking about WC3 Thrall. He was way more interesting
[4:10:38] Connectus: WoW Thrall was just AFK for 2 straight expansions MingLee
[4:10:41] Kriven: @Kriven so am i
[4:10:42] fillefaren: Finally got mythic jailer weapon after 2 months of farming! :D
[4:10:45] Lasidor: Thrall was, at one time, the most popular NPC/Faction Leader in WoW.  Not just Horde.
[4:10:56] Connectus: Then he just shouted at Garrosh for a bit and decided to become green jesus Kappa
[4:11:01] Frank4LuLz: i just want the Jon Snow sequal to happen!
[4:11:02] doomdrake13: Maybe they decided to divert thze time for the netflix show into Immortal LUL
[4:11:21] Lasidor: Uther was a badass too, if were going back to Warcraft.

[4:12:13] Orion280: starcraft movie would be absolutely amazing i wish there was more starcraft stuff to begin with
[4:12:17] xirangeix: I just want a good stargate AAA RPG :(
[4:12:22] Aidler: or upcoming documentary “Diablo Immoral” naguuraGiggle
[4:12:27] Lasidor: Starcraft could be a great MMO too.  Imagine being a SIege Tank operator and taking on huge alien swarms lol
[4:12:30] cykaslaya95: starcraft pussy version of 40k
[4:12:52] rodomenr: are frijoles good for our health?
[4:12:54] Velashen: Hell I’m amazed they haven’t done anything at all with Starcraft. Wasted franchise.. hopefully Microsoft fixes that
[4:13:09] Connectus: @Lasidor could be interesting if you had certain classes that could do that kind of stuff yeah. Medic could ride a medivac for example
[4:13:18] Connectus: But I think it's tough to translate it into a proper MMO
[4:13:26] Orion280: you could make instant nostlagia bucks with anything starcraft
[4:13:32] Velashen: World of StarCraft would be god tier done right.
[4:13:41] 無職提督: RTS is bascally dead
[4:13:45] Kriven: yeah rts just does not have the same pull it used too
[4:14:00] Connectus: StarCraft 1 got a sprite remaster up to 4K
[4:14:04] Zapp_Brannigan86: Over 20k people watching the sc2 dream hack thing
[4:14:07] Connectus: That's actually done  pretty well, really enjoyed it
[4:14:07] Velashen: Orcraft started out as an RTS too things can change.
[4:14:12] Lasidor: @Connectus I agree wholeheartedly.  So much untapped potential.  Heck, even being a frontline Firebat and just torching fools
[4:14:13] SpidercowSD: MOBA's like DOTA and LOL took over RTS's slot
[4:14:15] Velashen: Warcraft*
[4:14:20] doomdrake13: They wrote the StarCraft characters into the ground.
[4:14:32] SpidercowSD: DOTA was birthed from Warcraft 3
[4:14:35] Shaeli: HotS is the only pvp i play
[4:14:35] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: all games are niche
[4:14:37] SpidercowSD: and LOL

[4:15:06] Zapp_Brannigan86: Is prot slower leveling then ret by much?
[4:15:07] Tecni: time to make HotS the movie Kappa
[4:15:13] N3llee: man even Lux came back to wow
[4:15:35] Connectus: @Zapp_Brannigan86 depends on the gear, can be pretty fast. Heck even Holy can be fast, just group them up and concecrate the hell out of them

[4:15:43] Connectus: consecrate *
[4:16:06] nevermetal: i hope they add race change to tbc in prepatch, time for my undead to be  a zugzug
[4:16:17] portend: Pretty sure Joana is refreshing his guides
[4:16:19] Connectus: Literally do the Magister's Terrace dailies as holy on my paladin, amazed how fast mobs get deleted MingLee
[4:16:32] SpidercowSD: @Velashen Its a tough sell, they have a good base, but shooter based MMO's or RPGS are hard to keep going look at Defiance, Outriders, Division also very Niche though it would be cool to see a Starcraft MMO in the Star Wars Art style
[4:16:37] 無職提督: exactly, when u can flame others for ur fail game, moba, is way much better than u r the only one to blame, rts Kappa
[4:16:38] Connectus: So just lvling as holy and pulling like 4/5 mobs at a time
[4:17:26] Connectus: @nevermetal they said they aren't going to do it FeelsBadaMan
[4:17:29] Connectus: FeelsBadMan *
[4:17:35] Velashen: @spidercowsd if anyone can do it I’m sure Blizzard could do it. Especially with Microsoft backing.
[4:17:53] SpidercowSD: They got Immortal Money so who knows whats coming man
[4:17:53] Connectus: Yeah consecration is really OP in classic, literally surprised me when I decided to try doing dailies as holy
[4:18:05] nevermetal: @Connectus well they said they won't add their build in quest helper so part of me still hopes but im still leveling a new lock for wotlk
[4:18:47] Connectus: @nevermetal I hope they do too, but I doubt they will. They also don't want to build a classic armory so FeelsBadMan
[4:19:02] Velashen: Yeah they have been brewing something up.
[4:19:04] jkitchin75: like mixer
[4:19:13] DevilSpire: SC3 would be awesome
[4:19:14] CaarrotTop: Makes sense since they got rid of MIXER
[4:19:16] Connectus: But Microsoft also likes keeping old franchises alive if they have a good fanbase.  So WoW is safe
[4:19:19] Connectus: Luckily
[4:19:32] Aidler: didn’t Mike also hint at some point that something is coming for Starcraft?
[4:19:46] Frank4LuLz: Give it to a lead dev who still likes to play video games and make it better, make it great agin
[4:19:49] Connectus: Maybe Microsoft will breathe new life into StarCraft, they did it with Age of Empires which is very fun to play
[4:19:55] N3llee: Microsoft didnt pay 50 billion dollars
[4:19:56] XeenDK: So sad Overwatch flopped, such a fun game
[4:19:58] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee Starcraft/Warcraft RTS games are insane at the high tiers of play.
[4:20:02] CaarrotTop: microsoft gave Ninja a bag for no return essentially
[4:20:06] N3llee: for nothing
[4:20:11] Connectus: @Shiftngames afaik Overwatch didn't flop at all
[4:20:12] Kriven: poor mixer I actually liked it. Way better interface than youtube and facebook
[4:20:50] Connectus: The timing of pulling the plug out of Mixer was pretty bad though, right after they decided to do it Twitch went into a controversy
[4:20:56] Connectus: Might've been their chance to win that battle
[4:20:57] Velashen: Exactly they saw potential in the franchises, not in how blizzard operated at all. That’s why I have hope that some of these neglected ones will move forward.
[4:21:12] Connectus: True, I agree
[4:21:15] Laluzmia: MS knew what they was doing this was the right time to buy them out lol
[4:21:21] angelsim: is that thing still alive?
[4:21:34] CaarrotTop: They needed more of an ecosystem than what they had
[4:21:36] Brodih_: and to be honest, Shroud and Ninja are good games, but I find them really boring to watch
[4:21:40] schneid4: or just grow organically
[4:21:42] Kriven: @Shiftngames OW was a massive success what do you mean?
[4:21:44] Brodih_: good at*
[4:21:46] XeenDK: @Connectus Overwatch flopped big if you look back at the viewer count and the competition sizes, no one is playing attention to overwatch rn, only overwatch 2
[4:21:49] Herzenliegen: Now they're back on twitch
[4:21:52] Connectus: @Velashen hope so, there's a lot of good stuff from Blizzard that are just dead atmo. Can't wait for Diablo 4, really hope it's going to be fun
[4:22:02] XeenDK: @Kriven Look where overwatch is now
[4:22:10] Connectus: @Shiftngames viewer count doesn't matter at all whatsoever, doesn't determine a game's success
[4:22:12] 無職提督: yea, the growth of the 500-2000 streamer is way better than 10k whales no doubt
[4:22:20] Kriven: @Shiftngames does not mean it flopped lol it made bank and was everywhere when i launched
[4:22:26] CritcobainTV: There's no shot other streaming sites will just "grow organically" with how popular the others are
[4:22:28] Connectus: Competition sizes, meh... It's not a good e-sports game
[4:22:36] N3llee: you mean like ashes of creation (in 2030)
[4:22:39] MisterBongwater: It would have been the best way to split the difference by getting more lower-level talent
[4:22:49] Connectus: Overwatch sold pretty well, so it definitely isn't a flop
[4:22:56] XeenDK: Overwatch went big hella fast, but they lost players sooo fast to
[4:22:59] Kriven: @Connectus esport and twitch viewers does not account for if a game is successful or not
[4:23:12] XeenDK: If overwatch 2 isnt a succes, then it will shitdown 100%
[4:23:19] Connectus: @Kriven exactly what my point was, I wasn't the person claiming that :)
[4:23:28] Kriven: @Connectus i know
[4:24:15] Connectus: @Shiftngames esports and twitch don't determine a game's success. Overwatch 2 will do fine as they are actually making a good game. Does it have to exist? Nah, but it's going F2P (smart move)
[4:24:30] Connectus: PvE will be paid, I'm going to buy it because I'm actually interested in more story

[4:24:34] Yanoru: Yeah people go on Twitch, see not many viewers and think the game is "dead" Pepega
[4:24:43] almostdps: I hope the Blizzard/youtube partnership ends soon
[4:24:49] nevermetal: i think they say it's a flop for what it was intended to be by blizzard
[4:24:50] Connectus: @Yanoru yeah, it's so ignorant lol
[4:24:52] Kinghorn: ^
[4:25:08] LeagueofAdi: 1.2k viewers on overwatch 2 atm  ... they are holding nothing atm
[4:25:08] Lasidor: Lets not forget that Overwatch wasnt initially meant to be what we see it as now.  RIPTitan
[4:25:20] K4ykay: So still no LFG?
[4:25:21] Kinghorn: remember when blizzard made overwatch shorts and comics

[4:25:33] Kriven: @LeagueofAdi viewer count is not the only metric for success
[4:25:35] Connectus: @nevermetal that would make sense if their goal was for it to be a big e-sports game and getting huge amount of viewers on Twitch. Which I doubt was the reason for the game's existence as it's a horrible goal to try and achieve
[4:25:42] Connectus: You'd just be setting yourself up for failure
[4:25:42] ScuddsMcDudds: Can you get cold weather flying at 70?
[4:25:54] Kinghorn: 77 ScuddsMcDudds
[4:25:57] Connectus: @ScuddsMcDudds nope, probably coming in a later phase
[4:26:03] Connectus: Oh oops...
[4:26:06] Kinghorn: then when you hit 80 you can buy a book to give to alts
[4:26:09] Connectus: normal is available at 77
[4:26:10] XeenDK: I didnt say it was a flop, i said it "flopped" / Failed, it went soo huge everywhere, and everyone was buying teams etc. then they changed the game so much and banned people etc. so the game went down in use... seeing where it were and where it is now, there is a huge difference and i wouldnt say wow is a flop ever after playing it for 16-17 years @Towelliee
[4:26:16] Kinghorn: if that is in at launch
[4:26:17] Connectus: heirloom flying is 80 but later phase seemingly

[4:26:28] nevermetal: @Connectus if that exactly wasn't the purpose of the game how do you explain the extremely forced league you had to pay millions to enter as an org?
[4:27:06] Connectus: @nevermetal you might be right, but that's how to run your company into the ground 101. That said, Blizzard is rolling in WoW money so MingLee
[4:27:11] K4ykay: is it  abug?

[4:27:23] Connectus: Making a game just for that purpose is stupidity at best and a poor business decision
[4:27:39] angelsim: should've used in on him  I think
[4:27:59] Kinghorn: also could just be bugged lol
[4:28:29] rowbojenn: @Connectus couldn't they have done both? Tried to make a great game people will buy and planned to force an e-sports league for it?
[4:28:34] Connectus: That said Overwatch is a great casual and fun game, which Blizzard does very well a lot of the time
[4:28:53] Connectus: @rowbojenn ofcourse, but ppl claimed that was their goal. Which is a very poor business decision if so and I really really doubt that
[4:29:00] Kinghorn: yup looks bugged
[4:29:07] Timothious: looked like you have to die
[4:29:08] Kinghorn: try agane
[4:29:10] Connectus: Knowing Blizzard their goal was just to create a fun game, wanting an e-sports league was another
[4:29:26] rowbojenn: @Connectus oh fair enough, I might have missed part of the convo lol
[4:29:34] Connectus: @rowbojenn no worries :)
[4:29:36] CritcobainTV: its not bugged, it says that stormhoof has to die and you pick up the horn from him
[4:29:41] AcidSkass: You have to leave the "body" and use it as yourself
[4:30:20] woohdakidd: woohdakidd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 98 months! Love the content. I hope you are doing well. Cant wait to camp the time lost for 5 days again monkaS
[4:30:21] Blankelos: Escape you tauren form like he did
[4:30:25] lupiuss: exit tauren mode
[4:30:26] Timothious: the guy was laying there dead at the end ?
[4:30:38] angelsim: the body needs to die I think
[4:30:46] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee u have to let stormhoof die, then ipck up the orn
[4:30:48] CritcobainTV: horn
[4:30:52] Kinghorn: the quest should auto kick you from the vehicle it is bugged
[4:30:56] Timothious: watch it again
[4:31:02] Kinghorn: what
[4:31:07] Timothious: dont use abilitys
[4:31:30] pi70n: there was yellow text on the video that didn't appear for you
[4:31:35] happybooger: 3rd time is the charm
[4:31:43] Blessedheals: I think you used abilities
[4:31:52] Connectus: Drinking honeymint tea again while lvling PogChamp
[4:32:15] Connectus: Can't wait for WotLK classic, also can't wait for Dragonflight PogChamp
[4:32:21] angelsim: he gets him out of his 3 in order to not kill him with an ability it seems
[4:32:22] shortyforthewin: he died wit the character then he change face and picked up the horn
[4:32:28] Kinghorn: LUL
[4:32:36] Kinghorn: doing it the old fashion way
[4:32:36] Blessedheals: You may get silver
[4:33:04] swimmingfisch25: stormhoof needs to die while your using him it says it in the quest
[4:33:19] CritcobainTV: ^
[4:33:36] Timothious: doesnt the quest say to pick up the horn after the tauren died

[4:33:42] CritcobainTV: just auto attack him and that thing will slap u around
[4:33:42] swimmingfisch25: just auto attack
[4:33:53] angelsim: let him kill you?
[4:33:56] Kinghorn: #1 Use the Lorehammer in the Temple of Life #2 Defeat the North Wind by casting Storm Call from range and using Earth Shock against his Cyclone. #3 At 20% he is weakened and you will be "dismounted". Pick up the horn that spawns on ground.
[4:34:01] Kinghorn: it seems very bugged
[4:34:08] Blessedheals: Maybe just auto attack and don't manually leave the vehicle.
[4:34:15] Kinghorn: huh
[4:34:28] Kinghorn: I do not remember this quest at all
[4:34:38] Broomba: pepeMeltdown

[4:35:07] Cryttan: 24 hour stream on wrath launch?
[4:35:13] Broomba: you wraith as ally
[4:35:43] CritcobainTV: you might have to use a couple abilities
[4:35:46] CritcobainTV: just dont get him below 20
[4:35:48] Farfic: He did all that because he was max level
[4:36:00] Brae22: I couldn't finish that quest. Think is bugged
[4:36:02] Shiggih: Are seals busted atm? ive got 2 seals of corruption and can stack one of them with seal of wisdom/light
[4:36:10] Farfic: higher than Wrath level
[4:36:22] CritcobainTV: I'd use abilities now lol
[4:36:44] Blessedheals: Hahahaha
[4:36:48] CritcobainTV: horn on the ground?
[4:36:57] angelsim: seems glitched
[4:37:01] Kinghorn: bugged, report and move on
[4:37:04] Timothious: wow so it has to die at the same time lol
[4:37:05] Connectus: Seems bugged
[4:37:06] Kinghorn: eweaseShrug
[4:37:11] CritcobainTV: maybe do it at the same time if u can lol
[4:37:23] Kinghorn: mutual destruction
[4:37:29] Broomba: that spaghetti code
[4:37:44] happybooger: mythic raider towCringe
[4:37:49] Tac2cul2: every melee hit u do is 1% of his health
[4:37:49] CritcobainTV: possibly, idfk
[4:37:52] Kinghorn: yeah the ground aoe right before you die
[4:37:55] CritcobainTV: i just know it said he had to die LUL
[4:37:56] Connectus: @Broomba as long as they despaghettify it for launch it's fine PogChamp
[4:37:58] Connectus: Kappa
[4:38:09] CritcobainTV: do u have the horn in your bag or something somehow?
[4:38:14] Timothious: would need to be closer than 25 or will you ability do 5%
[4:38:24] Kinghorn: When North Wind gets low, you automatically die as Stormhoof and are returned to your own body--just loot the horn next to North Wind's body and right click it to win.
[4:38:27] Timothious: the hord is big
[4:38:29] happybooger: @Towelliee any new good G Fuels that just came out?
[4:38:31] Timothious: horn
[4:38:36] Thoreya: shitshow
[4:38:52] Kinghorn: yeah so it is bugged
[4:39:06] Brae22: Tried to do it 3 times and I gave up :(
[4:39:11] CritcobainTV: maybe stormhoof has to be lowish for him to kill u automatically
[4:39:54] rowbojenn: closer to the  middle then maybe?
[4:39:55] happybooger: oh damn
[4:40:00] rowbojenn: maybe the mob is dying outside the area
[4:40:27] Timothious: try and find a diff video
[4:40:41] Kinghorn: icecrown time!
[4:40:44] Kinghorn: 100% bugged

[4:41:00] Kinghorn: bloobySmug Critcobain
[4:41:03] CodemanPeach: i might jump onto the wrath classic while waiting for dragonlands lol
[4:41:05] CritcobainTV: LUL
[4:41:16] angelsim: can't get more descriptive than that

[5:29:01] NieIas: true that
[5:29:11] Azzudin: @P4RT1CLEM4N They're supposed to be 'fine', but are considered to be the weakest tank outside of 2 or 3 specific fights.
[5:29:15] dave3ooo: i'm logged into beta and retail right now

[5:29:21] namelles_: beta is different
[5:29:23] Darquesoul: I think there is a setting for it in the blizzard launcher
[5:29:29] sheerheartattackyk: the introduction of glyphs on wrath was big, but now just only crappy cosmetic. Like removing all the fun on them, it's blizzard after all
[5:29:34] GroovyBryan: I was getting bored on retail last night so I decided to level a BE pally just to get ready for wotlk
[5:29:36] AmaterasuS: beta counts as a "different" account so you can log both at the same time unlike retail + classic
[5:29:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: you cant be on classic and retail but this is not classic its beta
[5:29:38] Lokajin: @Darquesoul yes enable multiple game instances

[5:52:41] Kelticlore: how did you feel when they removed the xp  buff from heirlooms
[5:53:22] toucans46: Heirloom gear is just pointless it does nothing
[5:53:26] cahoots82: The biggest benefit of the heirloom gear currently is just not having to swap out those pieces as you level.
[5:53:30] Kynarien: I hope they dont put heirlooms in
[5:53:57] AmaterasuS: go hunt for more chips :D
[5:54:04] Syprus1: heirlooms were the decline of dungeon expeirence for the player

[5:55:01] Syprus1: what is that bell sound?
[5:55:04] Herzenliegen: The drop rate for the oil use to suck.

[6:00:45] delrancher: When is release?
[6:00:48] Kinghorn: oh didnt notice you mentioned it was a prime reward but yeah, it has no relation to anything
[6:01:04] Celestia6: It does match up though, that would be interesting. Like the fire crown is right now during the fire festival / 4th of july

[6:06:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: The TBC servers are all going to Wrath
[6:06:08] Kinghorn: there is no more cloning
[6:06:10] vulkankragon: even in the top privateserver warmane majority of the quests don't work in icecrown
[6:06:13] Kinghorn: they all turn wrath
[6:06:13] AmaterasuS: I know about layers :D but a lot of people even on my server with 20k horde pop just chose not to do dailies cause they didn't benefit them .... these dailies are required
[6:06:16] nevermetal: aint nobody hyped to stay on tbc servers
[6:06:26] Vedros_: they aren't doing a tbc era servers

[6:07:02] Kinghorn: we still have not seen a glaive in our main raid, we have 2 in guild though
[6:07:14] Kinghorn: and we saw a bow on our first KJ kill
[6:07:37] Kinghorn: yeah they will still be open
[6:07:37] vulkankragon: is blizzard using the warmane client for the beta?
[6:07:40] Zapp_Brannigan86: @Towelliee Do you plan to start on one of the "Fresh" servers? I read they were doing a 50% xp boost to which will help get to 70 in time for wotlk
[6:07:44] Kinghorn: people still doing naxx in tbc
[6:07:45] DBGmal: very true
[6:07:57] Kynarien: 2 guilds on our server have seen the bow off KJ on first kills, took our main raid til 2 weeks ago to see a glaive
[6:08:05] DBGmal: i dont think so
[6:08:08] Vakje: wotlk might do way better later. the expansion is still fairly relevant in the private server scene
[6:08:11] DBGmal: naxx 40 man at 60 is gone
[6:08:12] Kinghorn: yeah the titles go away
[6:08:13] eggsmasher: in tbc yes

[6:08:33] Kelticlore: people wont be able to get the legendary Staff Ateish when Wrath comes out
[6:08:45] AmaterasuS: personally, I'd only want to get glaives to feel how strong they are during Sunwell
[6:09:26] Zavier420: @Towelliee What server is the hammer squad on in retail?
[6:09:42] Aro725: Not all the way, but probably use them in Nax
[6:09:42] Theduskflyer: they used glaives in TOTGC on last boss.
[6:09:59] AmaterasuS: glaives are nice in wrath but not as nice cause their attack power buff is for demons only which don't exist in wrath content really
