[3:20:55] sheebydh: The BEST way to get your sockets+ conduit upgrades is to do the questline to unlock archivist codex, then farm a TON of Cataloged Research. you can do this with a 5 man group with Collapsing Riftstones which allow your entire group to enter the rift in the maw (whoever opens the rift enters last). Each riftstone give your group 15 min inside the rift. Then there is an optimal path of Famished Darkness mobs. Kill as many as possible in 15 min, they have high drop rate for epic and rare cat resea
[3:20:56] Littlehoodie16: to get final reknown to get to rank 80
[3:21:05] insectplato: i tak eit 9.2 PTR will be out soon

[6:27:32] GodZenden: i don't understand. People were begging for wow classic for years and now that they gave to us, people just complain and quit the game... For example, fresh is coming in 1 week and no one cares
[6:27:56] kreatorzero: i myself am looking to get into a game atm, but without a "partner / teammate" to play with that has similar timeframes as I, makes it difficult to do so
[6:28:00] junkagee: vondeep i agree
[6:28:09] kreatorzero: so I would understand this
[6:28:16] fightingchickin: Classic just ended though lol
[6:28:24] crusadein: No matter the game, even if devs listen to the players they will always complain
[6:28:36] GelatoCrow: theres a lot of people hype for fresh you shoulda seen the beta it was crazy
[6:28:43] junkagee: classic only ended for retail players ^^
[6:28:51] kreatorzero: @crusadein who complain the players or the dev's lol
[6:28:52] GelatoCrow: im a retail player and even im hype
[6:29:26] GodZenden: imagine blizz closing classic servers. in a few years from now, people would start asking for wow classic again... when you don't have you desire it and when u finally have you just don't care, like the kids in christmas lol
[6:29:48] fightingchickin: Everyone who wanted to play, played. Convincing them to rerun with minimal changes idk
[6:29:50] Onehiitter: this is a big reminder why i don't want to group up with anyone in wow.
[6:30:25] avenomxx: fresh will be fun if you have a leveling buddy for 40% more quest xp, it helps a lot
[6:30:26] kreatorzero: @Vondeep i understand the need for classic servers over and over as it re-invents the ideal of that generation to new kids coming
