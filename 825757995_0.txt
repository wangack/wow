[1:04:50] jw4ts: no way
[1:04:56] D4mol4mo: bomb chains on MT
[1:04:57] Wh3resWa1do4: is there anyone in chat that can tell me if it's worth getting into WoW rn? i have never played before
[1:04:59] NeckbeardInTheAttic: ally doesnt have chain heal and they do it easier....
[1:05:02] reluf: main tank only needs 2 heals, the rest should go to hateful tanks
[1:05:02] D4mol4mo: we did it last night
[1:05:02] Awastebasket: @shroud we were enjoying the main menu why‚Äôd u change
[1:05:06] Meshugunah: @JDMurph this is the last classic raid
[1:05:07] Poleritude: @mjaeldiq yes i'm sure most people just run off from raid guilds to PvP
[1:05:08] Oblag: @shroud if their health goes higher than another top 4 threat, isnt it better that they take hateful?
[1:05:10] termos1234: @JDMurph it has just stopped
[1:05:17] felere: @vespawow ally have Kings
[1:05:17] XpOsE_TRiiCkZz: Nah we already back? Lmao

[1:05:35] haruki40: i had my shamans do 8/8 T1 and HW and we did fine
[1:05:36] JDMurph: So basically once your geared then you do nothing?
[1:05:38] DBerg24: rank 1 still pulls aggro that hard?
[1:05:44] ThomasofArc: @shroud Hey, what's your main hand? i see maladath
[1:05:45] ganjelol: what is the name of Unit frame portrait
[1:05:49] thehivemind1: For mana efficiency?
[1:05:51] garbobean: round man gonna get one shot
[1:05:54] NeckbeardInTheAttic: what im trying to say is if someone gets healed over a tank they will get 1 shot
[1:06:00] doc_jade: people dont know the mechanic lol. main tank only takes melee. 2/3/4 threat get hateful strikes based on their HP value
[1:06:02] haruki40: no it's more frontloaded
[1:06:10] BillBob605: RIP World Buffs 1st pull Sadge
[1:06:12] beachboy37: What‚Äôs ur pc set up?
[1:06:13] crewara: @shroud Watch 100t stream?
[1:06:16] MoonzenTV: why did they not talk about all this before the raid ??
[1:06:16] rodavlasilad: chat what boss did they clear last night? did they get loatheb?
[1:06:22] felere: @vespawow only if they're in the top 5 on threat
[1:06:26] Pearlwoodz: The splash on 8/8 T1 is ASS
[1:06:29] imnotoriousbig: they need to be higher hp then the dps so chain healing heals the dps so they get hateful strike
[1:06:35] garbobean: they got loatheb yea
[1:06:36] xCLOUDEDViSIONZ: @vespawow that‚Äôs not how it works. It targets the most HP offtank between the 2nd and 4th on the threat meter
[1:06:36] 24KCustard: 24KCustard subscribed with Prime. 
[1:06:40] jw4ts: t1 chain heal off main hits for nothing
[1:06:41] Meshugunah: main benefit of 8/8 T1 is that the splash can proc the mana restore
[1:06:48] Kikoman90: i love the drama there is on all the wow streams
[1:06:48] Spectrum987: 8/8 t1 has such shit stats its not as good as the 3pc t2 chain heal spam

[1:06:52] kuxufipi: but isnt the thing that everyone that did it, has like 20 warriors pumping dps directly from start so shit dies way before anyone can run oom @shroud
[1:06:54] hoosthestallion: @ynokidneyshottho they got loatheb but called it after wiping on 4H a few times
[1:06:57] thehivemind1: It balances out because of all the healing bonuses the players have
[1:06:59] E_MAL1E: yo
[1:07:00] Ghoulplayerx: How far did they get?
[1:07:18] reluf: @shroud 2 healers on main tank, the rest should be healing wave on hateful tanks
[1:07:21] tatzmania: It's T1 vs 100 Thieves next! Let's go Skadoodle!!! :)
[1:07:23] hallohaaha: !time
[1:07:23] StreamElements: @pepomariana, Mike's local time is: 14:57
[1:07:24] reluf: you want their health to be staggered so someone doesnt take two in a row
[1:07:30] its_summ: @shroud in the logs i saw, the shaman are using ONLY rank 3 chain heal. they're able to do this because the kill time is so low, so idk if you guys can do it with rank 1 or if your kill speed is enough to use rank 3
[1:07:38] 3_LifeLine: shroudLove shroudLUL shroudLove
[1:07:43] jp_theta: Leeeeeroy Jenkins
[1:07:43] OatmanTV: kinda crazy how alliance have so many more clears than horde
[1:07:47] ub1quitous7: Yall complicatin the hell out of this
[1:07:52] Poleritude: I"m sure what a lot of people aren't getting about Health levels, and higher health not always being better for getting hit instead of the tanks, is that Damage mitigation is a big deal in WoW and boss fights.
[1:07:54] maddhatter423: shroud you going to roll a pally in bc?
[1:07:56] ilegaI: there is a trinket in the auction house that reduces the mana burned by chain heal by %40
[1:08:01] Meshugunah: alliance is wayyy stronger as a PvE faction, paladin vs shaman isn't even close
[1:08:02] thehivemind1: Paladins screw it all up

[1:35:32] MoonzenTV: @shroud are you hyped for TBC ? What are your thoughts about this, fresh or progressive btw ?
[1:35:33] kellarXO: are people gonna be complaining about heroic KJ dying in 2hrs when classic tbc releases?
[1:35:34] ShotgunWoW: @MoonzenTV fresh or progressive? whats that supposed to mean? its gonna be progressive even if its fresh or you can copy your characters over
[1:35:34] tranqowo: @LannyHoang my fiance was in death and taxes
[1:35:35] DecksW: not using flask on progression??
[1:35:36] spekk777: THAT Screams LOLW

[1:35:43] LannyHo: @tranquilityOwO name? I was one of the OGs
[1:35:45] Peljack: @MoonzenTV no then you shy?
[1:35:47] psyranx: @Danielhej well, considering vanilla took MONTHS and this takes less than a day. and vanilla was considered impossible btw. this is nerfed garbo version of vanilla
[1:35:53] misterpalmM: misterpalmm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 4 month streak! TWO YEARS OF ENTERTAINMENT
[1:35:55] Najasoh: hows naxx treating u all?>

[1:36:04] Aaradin: its not nerfed people just know everything about the game
[1:36:08] garbobean: bro, people couldnt even say logged in 15 years ago
[1:36:08] JudgementOfKira: @Psyranx Stay in the past lmao
[1:36:11] Aaradin: people sucked back when this was new
[1:36:13] d0ntPhaZe: We dweebin out tonight?!
[1:36:14] fudgefingas: @Psyranx people were just bad at the game back then
[1:36:17] mrinvictus44: @psyranx do you understand that when you do something hundreds of time you get better?
[1:36:19] tranqowo: @LannyHoang high warlord warrior from vanilla
[1:36:22] Zylox_c: @bearwinsagainstgorilla its actually the best time right now
[1:36:25] Weedz420: How is Naxx treating them? "pt2"
[1:36:27] antsandwich: the only reason this seems easy compared to vanilla is because of the knowledge. its pretty much the same everyones just running meta
[1:36:32] rioterz1: I just looked at ur guilds combat logs, 36 wipes last night it says
[1:36:33] ShotgunWoW: @CodyF86 every single raid before naxx is nerfed, because they buffed items in naxx patch in vanilla
[1:36:35] Danielhej: @Psyranx yeah vanilla it took months! for these guys it took 15 years Pog
[1:36:35] retruns: deaam noi
[1:36:39] deadbees1: @Psyranx people got better because after all these years every boss mechanics and strats are already known now
[1:36:40] LannyHo: @fudgefingas no one knew what to do back in the day.. its all figured out aka ez mode
[1:36:41] infrangible696: yeah you have to acknowledge the player skill back then overall was trash compared to today.
[1:36:46] Tzunshun: reduce movement speed rofll
[1:36:49] Aaradin: they didnt buff items they just went with the 1.12 patch from the start
[1:36:50] MoonzenTV: @ShotgunWoW progressive = continued/copied BC servers from Classic / fresh = totally new TBC servers with no copy, really simple
[1:36:50] mrinvictus44: The people who beat it in a day played thousands of hours doing this shit @psyranx stop being a dumbass please
[1:36:51] Tubezi: Apparently blizzard should have cleared everyones heads so this would be as hard as 20 years ago Kappa
[1:36:52] joe0981: could you put the healing meter up aswell pls
[1:36:53] Aaradin: stop making shit up lol
[1:36:53] thehivemind1: There's so much research and info now, guilds can min/max and prep for these old raids

[1:36:55] fudgefingas: @LannyHoang
[1:36:56] ThundaClapMax: @Psyranx because a few guilds did it in one day with full world buffs and 5+ years of classic private servers doesnt mean its nefed
[1:36:56] Dubba2511: naah
[1:36:57] MannySJ: Rogue duel would be nice
[1:36:59] bassel47: eft
[1:37:00] Dubba2511: theres better one
[1:37:01] sorenmills: thats a one of the items were removed
[1:37:01] Aaradin: but yes it was easier compared to s tartin with patch 1.1
[1:37:05] MoonzenTV: @Peljack TBC beta in march, release in May
[1:37:07] Aaradin: but knowledge is why its easier
[1:37:12] asbraich: pally
[1:37:13] fudgefingas: @LannyHoang doesn't change the fact that player skill vastly improved since back then
[1:37:15] Peljack: @MoonzenTV that took a while but ty

[1:37:35] Extac0: hope this wow will die in a month
[1:37:41] Weedz420: Wasn't even all player skill back then. Computers are like 30,000x better now
[1:37:43] psyranx: @ThundaClapMax it was considered impossible in vanilla, whtat r u talking about. they have changed a lot for fclassic
[1:37:44] ShotgunWoW: @MoonzenTV thats not what progressive means when it comes to wow, progressive means that content is released in a progressive order, not about progressing through different expansions
[1:37:45] Aaradin: this is the same version of the game that the original nax was patch 1.13.5 ish
[1:37:45] xadason: is this a rerun?^^
[1:37:48] MoonzenTV: @Peljack i'm not at your disposal, i'm here to hear the thoughts of shroud, not you, but np. Idc about you

[2:50:44] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[4:33:17] sturmna: @shroud are you relevant?
[4:33:22] Dr_Jonesalot: makes you uncrushing tho
[4:33:23] itschampa: yeah you just need the zg trinket for 4 horseman taunts
[4:33:24] Sinlaeshel: the main appeal of shield block is the attack can't crush/crit

[4:33:27] Qoning: shield block % removes crit chance from target
[4:33:27] MIZEROK: @Draegenbaeg Bear is very good, you still don't want more than 1 bear and 1 resto though.

[4:51:39] dabler2: just get the addon 4Head

[4:51:42] UsualGames: UsualGames subscribed with Prime. 
[4:51:45] Barringer: LUL
[4:51:45] ceecer: The call to never AoE taunt / mocking is so bad.. mark application halves threat so you can manually pick up the boss if the og tank stops attacking

[4:52:03] LannyHo: @TheAspe haha yeah
[4:52:05] DownOnTheDpad__: @corkies2 It was made simple in wrath because groups were smaller. This version requires 8 tanks and the entire groups has to rotate.
[4:52:06] TheAspe: @LannyHoang or Blood something
[4:52:06] veiloflonelystars: loatheb, 4horseman, sapphiron , KT pepeLaugh still kicking peoples butt 16 years later.
[4:52:06] Rebos: @shroud you heal so youre a healer... get healcomm
[4:52:09] OxySantos_: is this shadowland or classic?
[4:52:12] BXFLOW: BXFLOW subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[4:52:14] Skillen2008: why dont you mark the tanks with raid markers skull/moon/square/cross And assign 1 dps group to each tank.. That way no1 dies from meteor
[4:52:19] Aint1_: @Davycrocket684 second or third one on this boss
[4:52:19] Ghostface_swe: @shroud what do you think of G502 Wireless Lightspeed?
[4:52:19] Topp3n: is this boss ?
[4:52:20] zixxxs: @alex_mograine 12/15 i think
[4:52:21] LannyHo: @TheAspe last person i was in contact with years ago was Antisnow
[4:52:22] drjonez94: what are u doing?

[4:52:56] alex_mograine: @zixxxs so this is last boss before sapphiron?
[4:52:57] radicales: why don't they rotate corner to corner after 3 marks?
[4:52:57] MattYee: what boss are we on?

[4:53:06] radicales: thats what i remeber doing on private servers
[4:53:06] Yogglol: Seeing incoming heals is pretty big
[4:53:09] TheAspe: @LannyHoang i came back to play for a bit when pandas came out. Jeydax was around for a bit.
[4:53:10] quiet_victories: @MattYee 4 horsemen
[4:53:18] ayo_kayo47: no idea whats goin on but im having a great time
[4:53:18] ScoobieDoom: other healers can't see your inc heals when you don't have it
[4:53:19] MattYee: @quiet_victories ty bb <3
[4:53:19] vixan: little bit better raid frames do help a lot, along with mouseover
[4:53:19] qgshadow: Is that like wipe 10 at that boss ?
[4:53:20] Dave_e: yeah its a pretty small addon, the other healers will love you for it
[4:53:21] yardboard: or just mouseover macros so u dont have to click each frame. but whatever works, works
[4:53:23] defc0n83: I stopped playing when pandas came out
[4:53:24] Oblag: how come you have to sit in the middle for awhile and cant just go to where the stack type is different?
[4:53:27] Rebos: Its micro but healcomm does heal with raid heals
[4:53:29] Aint1_: @Radicales that's what they trained just before, so I dont understand yeah
[4:53:29] LannyHo: @TheAspe oh yeah i remember hearing Jeydax took on more leadership roles or something to revive it all
[4:53:36] Rebos: help
[4:53:37] davisonxxd: can u switch to hps
[4:53:40] blernnn: Hi mango
[4:53:40] schollls: bouncy bouncy oh such a good time
[4:53:46] Roggay: @corkies2 you need way less tanks in wotlk and the mechanics are much more forgiving in general
[4:53:48] LannyHo: @TheAspe Kaboomz too
[4:53:48] alex_mograine: @vixan mouseover is whatever
[4:53:51] TheAspe: @LannyHoang yeah, that lasted about 4 weeks, lol
[4:54:05] vangott913: use singel target gear? just asking, I took a break p5 but I think at this boss you should use max add heal
[4:54:18] vangott913: gear
[4:54:19] AmoSteven: @shroud did u see the new cs operation?
[4:54:22] vixan: @alex_mograine just makes you more agile and better able to react and do what you want to do, so technically it's a lot more efficient
[4:54:25] novemberstand: can anyone tell me when shroud stream PUBG.. I've seen many videos on pubg streamed by shroud
[4:54:28] alex_mograine: Any1 counting wipes? Im interested

[4:55:10] corkies2: reading this boss it looks like its not inherently harder for anyone besides the extra tanks compared to wotlk
[4:55:13] youarethebeeessttt: hi Papa what are u playing
[4:55:14] emanueld29: high af

[4:55:57] Tina_The_Witch: how far in the raid are you?
[4:56:06] youarethebeeessttt: I'm here on twitch only to see my papa play
[4:56:07] LannyHo: @TheAspe trying to imagine who would be the most entertaining.. i know Schmitty would be the most annoying
[4:56:12] vixan: @alex_mograine you probably don't know how to set up the proper keybinds on your mouse or something. you trippin but w/e keep it up
[4:56:13] LannyHo: @TheAspe i always hated him lol
[4:56:13] Jaytechh: 4h is fun
[4:56:14] vangott913: I m hyped to come back for naxx, the game burned me out with r 14 grind :D
[4:56:20] squeezerbang: 14 woyers Pog
[4:56:25] 1mmune_: Did he beat that boss last night?? I left at like attempt 18.

[4:56:42] firestorm19899: march 2021
[4:56:42] LannyHo: @TheAspe maybe Vestige would be the best streamer to watch
[4:56:46] captain_knackarsch: @koolkanake sounds healthy

[4:56:49] zixxxs: @JesselovesWW yea they did

[4:56:55] Rebos: r14 grind in the beg must of been hell lol r14 now takes less then 16 weeks of 400k honor in most servers lol
[4:56:56] TheAspe: @LannyHoang Vestige would probably be it

[4:57:29] TheAspe: @LannyHoang not a chance
[4:57:30] corkies2: @sbl89 is it? reading both fights it looks like this is just a shitty rng fest on taunt, no other mechanics are different
[4:57:30] Turbopumper: dps and healing ain't much of an issue on this fight, it's all about getting the rotations down right
[4:57:33] vangott913: my guild is struggeling with saphi... today 2 1/2 hours trying

[4:58:02] OfficialNinjaBananen: rotation is everyting on this fight.. truly a tank fight
[4:58:08] Roggay: @corkies2 the tanking mechanics are different because less tanks in a 25man or 10man
[4:58:09] yardboard: thats what i do on my ele sham too :D
[4:58:10] 0alpha12358: i need to learn how to do that

[4:58:24] corkies2: @Roggay but its just a tank rotation, nothing else
[4:58:28] holygrim43: @shroud you pumped for castle nathria?
[4:58:28] n4sty_27: Oh
[4:58:28] Nocturnalraven: Oh god Flashbacks
[4:58:29] sloppyjoker89: @corkies2 not the mechanics, but the amount of health people have and the incoming dmg. in wotlk naxx you can survive much longer
[4:58:37] OfficialNinjaBananen: @shroud U playing 8 tanks or 4 ?
[4:58:38] n4sty_27: !rules
[4:58:38] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.
[4:58:40] youarethebeeessttt: when ur gonna play dayz
[4:58:45] perefourah: yoo shroud I love your WoW streams, super chill to watch

[4:59:01] Rebos: My guild got off on loatheb...
[4:59:02] Roggay: @corkies2 yep sure. The major difference is the relative damage of everything
[4:59:06] AmoSteven: they added pinging to the game now
[4:59:08] KeolaMich: Synergy
[4:59:10] OfficialNinjaBananen: @shroud U playing 8 tanks or 4 ?.

[4:59:42] OfficialStorken: comeone retail is really good
[4:59:46] OfficialStorken: Shadowlands <3
[4:59:47] TheAspe: @LannyHoang What I do miss about this is figuring out all of the mechanics on your own. No reading guides, watching tutorials. Just had to pay attention and come up with the strategy on your own.

[5:10:36] Igelness: KEKW
[5:10:36] deadbees1: 'not for your raid' lmao
[5:10:38] ceecer: shield wall 30s cooldown so dps past second trigger to skip it
[5:10:39] Yogglol: Need way more warriors for the nuke strat
[5:10:42] aau_: Shroud, they have to be separated, and killed individually, in a specific order. It is not a DPS race.
[5:10:44] doc_jade: @shroud yeah u need WBs and more war's
[5:10:44] bk_aus: you can burn them through the shield wall with enough dps though
[5:10:45] Meshugunah: shield wall actually has an icd so if you nuke them from 50-20 fast enough they only cast it once
[5:10:48] ElCabezonVerde: <3 Cheers <3

[5:10:53] Pawdington: @Shroud you assign a dps to each tank to mitigate Meteor dmg.
[5:10:53] RawnV: project 30 pumped meteor horse then rotated tanks after each kill except for the last horse that bounced back and forth 2 tanks
[5:10:53] KONGTHEGORILLA: twice if you dont get them low enough
[5:10:53] Chirrp: there were not huge guilds with multiple raiding groups back then

[5:10:55] Leggahots: yeah this raid has not the biggest dps
[5:10:56] Tooshkit: shieldwall every 25%
[5:11:01] bk_aus: theres a cooldown on the shield wall, they wont shield wall for 30 seconds after the first one
[5:11:02] jhen994: yes you absolutely can, you can DPS thane(meteor) down by focusing with melee/range and take one rotation out of the mix completely in ~30 seconds.
[5:11:03] Aint1_: you gotta destack absolutely, even the first world is doing it
[5:11:04] smittern: no its not

[5:12:19] geiszt: ???
[5:12:20] Turbopumper: my guild had everyone swap between mograine and kor'thaz for the shield walls until they died
[5:12:20] layercake2004: Every XPAC seems to be the same

[5:12:49] ogdunedan: I like you shroud but from an exp mythic raider I dont feel like someone who doesn't arena / raid at a high level can really comment on innovation
[5:12:49] HavingFunWrong: how much shadowlands have you played tho??? @shroud
[5:12:50] Bithda: make shamans tank again

[5:12:54] molo316: play SL LEL
[5:12:54] MonStarNZ: World of Starcraft?
[5:12:54] DoubleKillDan: because any competition dies out before making them do anything
[5:12:56] itschampa: Activision was the downfall of WOW
[5:12:56] RAFTtheReaper: @shroud at one point they were going to make a starcraft MMO
[5:12:58] Nemoses: reason people like wow is because it is the same and they aren't changing it to what its not
[5:13:00] prkr_ae: they try new systems each expansion, they're just garbage ideas/systems

[5:13:22] thiskreeper: @boxxxit. frfr
[5:13:22] LannyHo: @Pawdington imagine leveling up a ghost or Hydralisk.. just saying
[5:13:23] biggtom: BD did with the combat but other than that the game is meh
[5:13:23] medanite_: if they dropped the sub to 7-8 the playerbase would double

[5:13:35] KYalphaMFAM: Ashes is gonna be lit
[5:13:37] negativezi: change the combat system i say

[5:13:45] RAFTtheReaper: @shroud no they actually announced it, but scrapped it
[5:13:47] arugulan: TITAN
[5:13:48] MerlinStruggles: As one of the original backers for Star Citizen: I don't wanna hear anything about Cyberpunk 2077 taking too long

[5:43:21] ifiputyouinameatgrinder: @weedwizvrd it is. have you not been paying attention to how much this group is a joke?
[5:43:24] thiskreeper: what company makes a raid that requires this much people on coordination? do people actually complete this??? BabyRage
[5:43:25] GMWeasel: fire resist gear + disarm and the tank from mograine takes no damage, that leaves ppl to easly focus the meteor
[5:43:26] willamnord: damn son
[5:43:31] Ghost5392: @weedwizvrd It IS easy. Mechanically it is incredibly simple. The hard part is getting this many people to do it all in tandem. That's the hard part of all the classic raids.
[5:43:35] kekwthatguymaster: Isn't "LanceLot" that mecha name from Code Geass chat?

[5:44:10] CrabJuice: @thiskreeper Several guilds have completed it on the first day of release
[5:44:16] sloppyjoker89: @weedwizvrd easier than what it was back then, with all the knowledge, tactics and min maxing these days. but certainly not easy, still ^^

[5:46:23] ArmaniSalsa: @CrabJuice no need for that
[5:46:29] TStubb23: @ADHDeez ive been raiding about 3-6 hours per week for last year in classic. dont need much more than that except gold farming
[5:46:29] ifiputyouinameatgrinder: difficult

[5:46:41] Kreindal: @davidmikemyer Yeah I have - Only 27 guilds have gotten Nax down.. Everyone assumes that this raid is easy.

[5:47:14] Ghost5392: @weedwizvrd 100% Anybody who thinks that THIS is bad did not do this in Vanilla or even in classic.

[5:48:28] Kreindal: @davidmikemyer Yeah Im not complaining about them, but got some people in chat saying that some people need to be gkicked cause of the wipes.. Like hello? Too many retail people in here that haven't touched Classic and think its easy.
[5:48:34] kekwthatguymaster: it isn't that hard tbh, idk why you guys keep wiping :(
[5:48:37] LannyHo: @In1gomontoya i didnt realize how privileged i was to be raiding with a top 10 raiding guild 15 years ago until i realized most people never had the opportunity to do such raids
[5:48:38] FortitudoMultis: Man and I thought organizing a Mythic+ in retail is hard, this shit is bonkers
[5:48:39] GewuerzWiesel: @Ghost5392 or lfr lmao

[5:48:51] iamjo3l: @Flooq thats the first add on after naxx they were still learning
[5:48:51] Pyjamaheld: morgraine has a procc on his AA that does a lot of fire dmg + fire dot. his aa is rather low
[5:48:56] GMWeasel: @shroud mograine has 25% on attack to proc fire dmage... i said... disarm + fire resist ez gg
[5:48:58] Turbopumper: mograine only does a fire damage dot to the tank, thane does a meteor like the anubisaths in AQ
[5:49:04] reminiscejp: ayoooooo finally this is where they stopped last night
[5:49:09] oCallMeViper: yo did csgo got new update?
[5:49:09] Ghost5392: @weedwizvrd To be fair, lfr sometimes feels like the most challenging raid mode in the game. LULW
[5:49:12] CrabJuice: @ADHDeez once you enter with "a grp" you're locked on that id until reset and can run it for as many times as you want in that time until you beat it
[5:49:15] Kreindal: @In1gomontoya Yeah but with todays content and xpacs wish they would bring back the 40 man raids.
[5:49:15] ArmaniSalsa: @azrael_gt Yeah. Looks like it. I just heard some people saying it was easy so I'm reading different perspectives on this

[5:51:47] d5_scavenger: @chucktownbrown basically they're unable to kill these mobs
[5:51:49] T_gin: yikes
[5:51:51] carpmeister: 4 horseman is a tough one
[5:51:52] general_antidote: I love how WoW still has the old loading screen
[5:51:56] ChaosFactorGaming: @chucktownbrown Every single boss has different mechanics, they just have to pull one of each into a different spot on the map, and swap tanks as soon as one is about to die to debuffs
[5:51:57] Kreindal: @In1gomontoya Honestly would be so much more fun, like still have the 25 man raids and 40 man raids can be an option for those interested. :P
[5:51:57] notmizzle: i don‚Äôt understand what happened but it‚Äôs a feelsbad i know that
[5:52:00] b4dbrad: what is towers controlled?
[5:52:00] codmi: is classic wow raids harder than new raids?
[5:52:01] bantha42: on thursday there was an uninterrupted stream of ghosts running back
[5:52:04] roxknee: !uptime
[5:52:04] jdog1360: brez mass rez made wow raiding alot easier lol
[5:52:04] GewuerzWiesel: imagine having to gear so many tanks. in retail you cant even get 2 to taunt in time
[5:52:04] StreamElements: @roxknee, Mike has been live for: 5 hours 52 mins
[5:52:09] CrabJuice: @holygrim789 you didn't reserve a spot for 1% of actually progressing, because it does happen FeelsGoodMan
[5:52:11] ChaosFactorGaming: @codmi totally not
[5:52:18] dathg: raytracing on?
[5:52:28] Awastebasket: They should try bloons tower defense
[5:52:30] GMWeasel: as soon mograine dies, the fight gets 40% easier when thane dies the fight is pretty much over
[5:52:32] hoibi_wasmachensachen: @codmi different not harder or easier
[5:52:36] Havok32: I‚Äôm out, good luck!

[5:52:41] Trainz09: yo
[5:52:43] zeeno91: heal meter instead of damage meter?
[5:52:49] reLiveSports: chat, with shroud as resto tonight, how many healers are they running?
[5:52:52] Threedog55: @shroud Sapp is gona be rough thogh. better to have the extra healing
[5:52:59] CrabJuice: @cnxt1101 Dno but they cleared in 80 mins
[5:53:00] holygrim43: @crabjuice true im just spoiled by the QOL improvements in retail

[5:53:07] jarredlima: shroud
[5:53:08] GewuerzWiesel: mechanics > damage @zeeno91
[5:53:09] supahnoodle: i do like that u cant just get max and kill all things in game
[5:53:10] Kreindal: @codmi It's hard to say, Classic raids are just so old and from when the game was new, plus the 40 man raids.
[5:53:12] californiway: shroud how many healers u guys rolling

[5:53:54] CrabJuice: Retailers, any real reason as to why they dont have 40-mans in retail?
[5:53:55] ShotgunWoW: @In1gomontoya kt is easier than sapp and 4hmen imo

[5:54:02] lil_louka: w
[5:54:03] Flooq: Normal retail is defintiely easier
[5:54:07] AnalogtoDigital: in retail the classes are also dumbed down and less complicated

[5:54:20] ImJns: you can do this boyos
[5:54:26] Cybagedon: @kyalpha270 ?

[5:54:38] caskey_x: You can compare them it‚Äôs the same game old vs new
[5:54:39] SpicyWe1ner: @CrabJuice cause it was a nightmare getting a 40 man raid together, 25 or even 10 was hard already to get a group or pug in, for the casualish people

[5:54:55] ShadowLTD: ask him lol
[5:54:55] deadbees1: iban 47 chad dad
[5:54:59] holygrim43: personally i think mythic raiding in retail keeps up with - and sometimes is even harder than - retail

[5:55:14] xyuza: Shroud, my friend ask how can you play with all that shit on your screen
[5:55:15] Holy_Aegis: Mythic raiding in retail is 100% harder than classic raids
[5:55:15] KYalphaMFAM: OkayChamp
[5:55:21] HarmOUR: hey guys, what's harder, wow classic or EFT :)
[5:55:21] GreasySteve: Classic WoW is best WoW
[5:55:25] JDMurph: 2020 is such a weird year...who would of though people would be wiping on Naxx lol
[5:55:28] TStubb23: mythic raiding is harder but classic is more fun haha
[5:55:32] TStubb23: imo
[5:55:35] GewuerzWiesel: @whhambamclamslam so ppl like you can complain about it
[5:55:36] J_Woods18: Think about being a kid watching shroud all day just to find out ur teacher raids with him on WoW
[5:55:37] alljustdusthere: yo shroud and how yall been hope yall r good make sure you drink lots of water and good food
[5:55:46] ChaosFactorGaming: LMAO That
[5:55:47] CrabJuice: @SpicyWe1ner See, I don't get that with my guild we are usually 35+ for our raids, so I don't really understand how that's such a hurdle in retail
[5:55:49] Ghost5392: @AnalogtoDigital The stuff that is easier in retail is the basic quality of life stuff. Not having to waste time running back as long, or drinking or to repair, etc.
[5:55:49] ChaosFactorGaming: Would be sick
[5:55:49] d5_scavenger: @weedwizvrd LUL

[5:57:37] caskey_x: For no lifer kappa
[5:57:37] ChaosFactorGaming: Classic is ALL about making sure everyone knows what's going on.. You get everyone their BIS, then you literally just farm everything that is the previous tier LUL

[5:57:44] sickangrybaby: Classic is just RuneScape
[5:57:45] siliconart: !936p
[5:57:45] StreamElements: @siliconart, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
[5:57:47] SpicyWe1ner: @CrabJuice especially this one.. when you have to 4 tank it i think.. it was a weird battle so respecing.. etc. i hated it
[5:57:50] tkbrummett: No Fort MonkaS
[5:57:54] HarmOUR: @Cybagedon Because they put 1000s of hours into retail so they have to think THEIR game is the hardest

[5:58:03] Lyferon: Classic wow is so hard. I don't understand how you guys play it
[5:58:09] 1nterlink: does shroud even have fr gear
[5:58:09] theDill: its hard to coordinate 40 raiders
[5:58:15] BlackSoulDH: classic requires grinding but no skill
[5:58:16] Noble_Squire: I've noticed everyone who played classic and then quit is kinda salty about the game hahaha

[5:58:30] slimpthepimp: min maxing ruined classic was way more fun when everyone was clueless
[5:58:32] CrabJuice: @SpicyWe1ner Understandable. I'm just a dumb mage, so I concentrate very hard on my "rotation" lol
[5:58:34] Cybagedon: @HarmOUR i think its just a vocal minority too, most ppl respect whatever game you play lol
[5:58:35] supahnoodle: its not easy though isit
[5:58:36] GreasySteve: WoW Classic is actually an MMO. Current wow is just a single player RPG now with matchmaking, it feels like.

[5:58:45] Troops93: My guild are doing naxx sunday !! Wish us luck
[5:58:46] Darkblix: I like how cooperative it feels, like you really need to coordinate with a group of 40 ppl perfectly
[5:58:46] Lyferon: Classic wow is the hardest game I have ever played
[5:58:47] ChaosFactorGaming: I think for the most part, people just don't want to go through the mindless grind of Classic
[5:58:48] MorkalMage: @GreasySteve truth
[5:58:51] Easykie1: Has that early 2000's MMO vibe, no hand holding
[5:58:52] GewuerzWiesel: @Noble_Squire yea cause they expected the same experience as back in the days. but its way more time consuming than most think
[5:58:53] cloudfirst: maybe i have ADD, but its difficult to follow along with whats going on when everyone be talking at the same time
[5:58:54] HarmOUR: @Cybagedon Yeah lol. Vocal minorities thrive in twitch chat

[5:59:18] ChaosFactorGaming: Also if you really don't have at least 40 people who consistantly play with you, or at least 10 at the lower levels, it will take you DECADES to get through to late game
[5:59:22] shadyderperlol: PogU Group 8
[5:59:23] ChaosFactorGaming: That was a good pull
[5:59:25] DanRoxuRSox: this is prolly my least favorite fight of naxx,

[6:02:25] cnxt1101: hacks?
[6:02:26] ShotgunWoW: @Lyferon classic is only hard in naxx, everything else was easy because there was no item progression, so items were buffed for 1.12 from the start
[6:02:30] madmatt707: Retail is only for mount grinding
[6:02:32] GewuerzWiesel: @Lyferon just different challenges, compared to retail.
[6:02:32] NateBui: ?
[6:02:32] GMWeasel: it procs on a AUTO ATTACK, auto attack miss = no dmg
[6:02:33] TStubb23: @Lyferon its not "free" like some people make it out to be but its not like mythic raiding which has over 700 wipes for first kill sometimes
[6:02:34] Barringer: getting 40 people in sync is not easy
[6:02:36] Faddei: Oh the dance ;D
[6:02:36] sebala95: compare this raid to a mythic raid in retail lol
[6:02:39] HavingFunWrong: @RAND0MIZED play retail trust me as long time wow player its better for new players
[6:02:41] dermatoid: after all the stacks and what not the 2 run in middle and taunt each others horseman
[6:02:42] Noble_Squire: Just chain lightning them for like 5mil dmg?
[6:02:43] GMWeasel: druid has more dodge = less proc
[6:02:44] ChaosFactorGaming: That ank rez smart af
[6:02:46] supahnoodle: i would be losing a few marbles playing this raid
[6:02:49] xCLOUDEDViSIONZ: @shroud Are they disarming?
[6:02:50] DeviSTatoris: if he runs deep prot without impale, he might have +5% extra parry from arms tree
[6:02:51] Kea_the_Krog: left down right up??!?!
[6:02:54] dermatoid: and run back into the corner again
[6:02:59] ScreamingEaglee: the shield wall is more noticeable on Mograine because less people are dpsing him at the start (focus on Thane)
[6:02:59] CrabJuice: @RAND0MIZED retail is probably more forgiving for new players
[6:03:06] KYalphaMFAM: @Kea_the_Krog flawless victory
[6:03:12] RxktsDonger: !mouse
[6:03:12] StreamElements: He's using the Logitech Pro X Superlight - With a Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad shroud Edition | https://load.gg/Logitech-Shroud

[6:03:17] MistakeNot_: damn they still haven't got this fight. It's gonna be a while. Good luck
[6:03:21] Lyferon: I could not even level my warrior to level 30 without friend's help. it means I'm bad?
[6:03:25] cnxt1101: Lance the invincible tank
[6:03:26] Kea_the_Krog: @kyalpha270 yay!!
[6:03:27] ChaosFactorGaming: Why do you have the damage done listed instead of healing or damage taken? LUL
[6:03:28] ameeelio: @x_dj id play classic first or you will just find the game confusing
[6:03:33] mosquito_frito: my guild disbanded in dec 2006 cause of this boss LUL, good ole memories kek
[6:03:35] KYalphaMFAM: LuL
[6:03:38] Cybagedon: @Lyferon no, they are a tough class to begin with
[6:03:41] GewuerzWiesel: @CrabJuice depends on what content you wanna play lol. if you wanna do hier tier raids retail seems more forgiving
[6:03:43] NastyNirsch: LEROOOOOOY
[6:03:51] SirEggman: ohh nice and here i was worried i missed the four horsemen
[6:03:52] caskey_x: Retail is more who guys who want to have a life between the grins

[6:04:17] AbroadCrown: let's gooo
[6:04:18] darkbrotherhood1: took 3 months to hit 60
[6:04:20] augaliciouss: which tank keeps dying?
[6:04:22] ShotgunWoW: @Lyferon you're not bad, you just dont know how to get weapon progression when leveling, you can level a warrior in under 3 days if you know the game
[6:04:25] bryceberglettuce: how are they doing? i was gone for an hour
[6:04:40] dzim: since when's shroud playing wow ?
[6:04:44] Lyferon: @ShotgunWoW interesting
[6:04:50] GewuerzWiesel: @CrabJuice i see :D if youre looking for a casual experience, classic is the way to go. but i think in terms of "user friendliness" retail is easier
[6:04:50] ameeelio: @bryceberglettuce they are not even close tbh
[6:04:50] Cybagedon: @dzim since launch i think
[6:04:50] ChaosFactorGaming: Oh Danyo isn't dual tanking
[6:04:52] sebala95: this raid is so easy comparing to retail mythic...
[6:04:52] trik0_: reino?

[6:05:04] untin: @dzim since always
[6:05:05] CrabJuice: @weedwizvrd agreed
[6:05:06] cnxt1101: lol.the healers
[6:05:06] ShotgunWoW: @Lyferon the game isnt based on skill, its based on knowledge
[6:05:07] ChaosFactorGaming: @littlebambiruthless ye
[6:05:11] bryceberglettuce: @ameeelio damn
[6:05:17] Turbopumper: which horseman tank is dying?

[6:05:22] wikegard: dont stop heal, just overheal it doesnt mather
[6:05:26] trik0_: what kingdom plays
[6:05:36] Meshugunah: ABC - always be casting, that's healer 101
[6:05:39] Lyferon: @ShotgunWoW Knowledge is a skill isn't it?
[6:05:42] EgoGrower: this is classic
[6:05:46] krawdof: Was this the boss that is easier with prot paladin?
[6:06:05] whiteking99: why u not play rainbow six?
[6:06:05] GewuerzWiesel: @Lyferon lmao
[6:06:05] TStubb23: i like the loot system in classic so much more, hate just looking at ilvl
[6:06:06] ChaosFactorGaming: @littlebambiruthless They need him to heal out on first couple raid clears because they need reliable healers, he usually picks up a couple of his bis on the clears for ele because not many people need those stats
[6:06:18] keetz87: Didn't this get cleared 15 years ago Kappa ?
[6:06:28] d5_scavenger: omg just kill the boss and be done with it
[6:06:28] KiLtyONeal: i would just sit baitin' in the corner
[6:06:30] Motox831: how bout this. youtube the fight and then do it

[6:48:59] Turbopumper: @red_bees the horsemen have each their own mark that they put on people nearby, the mark deals damage and with each mark, the damage is increased, so people can't stay on one horseman for too long

[6:49:30] mortisnexangelus: Her voice is soothing
[6:49:34] zixxxs: @red_bees I think everyoen has to rotate because each one has their own debuff that does damage when you are near it. so you move away from it to let the debuff fall off
[6:49:34] red_bees: @plsdonatethx ohhh makes much more sense. that seems really annoying

[7:16:20] druwpa: we blast them to the moon.
[7:16:20] creamycaesar: thane does meteor, so they need to drop stacks so they dont die to meteor

[7:17:31] nabil_wasir: hlw
[7:17:36] creamycaesar: melee is supposed to move in a triangle formation, theres a safezone where they drop stacks
[7:17:37] drowsymangoz: Yo Shroud do you agree that the saddest movies/shows have the best endings.
[7:17:37] neo1234: @shroud You should seriosuly burst one of them down, instead of doing the 4 rotation thingy

[7:18:10] TheSugma: Pretty sure #of stacks is just to allow the previous stacks of the previous horseman to fall off

[7:18:55] itschampa: when your buffed with 20 fury warriors it helps to do that
[7:18:57] creamycaesar: @deluh thats in wotlk naxx you can do that

[7:20:16] Ghost5392: @s1lentwraith Naxx was the hardest vanilla wow raid and it was so hard that a lot of the guilds didn't even bother clearing it. It was probably one of the least attempted end-game raids.

[9:08:42] vixan: @Multihog that, my friend, is a semantics discussion. We can argue about the meaning of words, or whether these drugs are endogenous or exogenous. The brain still produces what can and is classified as psychoactive substances.

[9:14:38] JBrightt: @Aggrobiscuit again, that's if you are smoking high potency weed at high amounts daily for years and years. In moderation weed has no negative effects. Can't say the same about cigs or booze

[9:15:05] yuhtzeee: @dsude weed itself is not addictive but if you have an addictive personality like myself, then yes to an extent

[10:06:24] bartonsprings: @shroud i used to play on a private server where half the void zones were bugged and were invisible so healers had to use elune stones to mark them or else people rotating after them would just randomly die on top of invis void zones

[10:07:25] boostdtroglodyte: just got here they stuck on 4 horse?
[10:07:28] tiltedteepee: Did they kill patchwerk?
[10:07:31] Shawn2897: got one to 1% so with better rng and a couple less hanging deaths its very doable
[10:07:32] ChaosFactorGaming: Did someone walk down another branch and say ads spawned? KEKW
[10:07:34] JesseJamesGames: Why not rotate if the meteor comes early so you only take 2 marks that rotate instead of 4?
[10:07:36] Lookatzack: its because its a bosses spell cast, the timing is different. Its a cooldown for the boss before they can use the spell. Not a timer for when the spell will come out
[10:07:38] Roeshambo: The way you're doing 4H is like the worst strat possible 0_o
[10:07:40] GMWeasel: there is weakauras with the abilities timers @shroud

[10:50:28] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[11:03:25] LeBraum_James: his health bar isnt going down
[11:03:25] StreamElements: @WhatTheFork_, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
[11:03:26] turn2spikejester: wait for brezes again! :D
