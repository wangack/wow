[1:25:02] ArtoAllan: @NiCii Balance dudu is only good in +24.. And then You get up to +27-29 and get one shotted by anything if your team doesnt set up defensives on you or stuns mechanics
[1:25:08] ArtoAllan: Not a PUG friendly class

[2:14:27] Sebleh: you kinda need a buddy or a guide to walk you through stuff
[2:14:41] CandleLightCat: YES dude. i had no idea how much reading you gotta do to actually be competitive in POKEMON.
[2:14:42] Lennerrt: league is overall unfriendly LUL

[2:14:48] xxxdabmaster69xxx: i see :) thanks for answering
[2:14:48] Sierrakilo96: i mean if get a nice guild its pretty ez to catch up all stuff :D
[2:14:49] semtex_30: @Lennerrt trrye
[2:15:25] xxxdabmaster69xxx: makes sense :)
[2:15:53] MrPodio: Learning the basic of a game. is easier on MMOs than FPs
[2:16:10] MrPodio: IMO
[2:16:14] vo1dexx: @Sebleh you have so much guides, can read and learn so easy. in other games u need really hard training.

[2:16:27] lixxon: Wow its crazy Mike-Ybarra is leaving microsoft/ blizzard @Naguura NotLikeThis NotLikeThis  just announced
[2:16:29] Sebleh: dang Qwik is leaving blizzard naguuraSip
[2:16:32] asurrraaa: Basics of an mmo are way harder than an FPS.
[2:16:35] DahFreak: aim and shoot vs dont stand in fire and press rotation
[2:16:41] Edav13: hello!
[2:16:41] y0rge: holly f
[2:16:50] critmatic: @lennerrt true!!!!
[2:16:54] Rysan89: Depends on what level your wanting to learn too. Basis of a fps is moving and shooting and general rule of the maps and game mode which is pretty easy to learn, compare to the systems in a mmo.
[2:16:58] sich_is_here: wow is fairly complex
[2:17:01] asurrraaa: Getting good at a FPS is where the difficulty is. where are getting good in a mmo is simpler.
[2:17:02] 69DamnedDaniel68: yea dont stand in fire and you got 90%
[2:17:14] Rysan89: But if your aim is to be high end or something fps i would rate is harder
[2:17:27] shawnwise: I'd argue WoW is one of the more beginner friendly mmos
[2:17:29] critmatic: @sich_is_here yup, that's why I'm starting with classic
[2:17:47] y0rge: is not
[2:18:04] xxxdabmaster69xxx: guess so, yeah :)
[2:18:13] Daiggernaut: its all about who you know and who you can be associated with..
[2:18:14] gambitenjoyer: I mean Venruki had the perfect analogy for that aswell. Lets say you watch Naguraa, and want to play WoW just like her. You need 30 addons, level the story, learn how to gear. But if you watch s1mple, all you need to do is download CSGO.... Nothing more
[2:18:15] y0rge: only hard thing into mythic raid is ... fight mythic guild
[2:18:22] asurrraaa: In terms of Top 20% of gamers. I’d say FPS and MOBAs are the toughest genres.
[2:18:24] y0rge: you dont need to get top 10 guild in the world
[2:18:30] reggiepowa: I started playing in late 8.2 and by mid of 8.3 I had ksm and aotc so it's not that hard to get into that level of pve
[2:18:32] TiPera: Also depends how much time u wanna put into the game
[2:18:50] sich_is_here: even though wow is complex, that is what makes it interesting, to fight the challenge and win
[2:18:54] Sierrakilo96: @y0rge killing first to 2 bosses in mythic is not mythic raiding :D
[2:18:54] mksmoke55: @lirklol delusional :D
[2:18:59] critmatic: @shawnwise hell no, ffxiv is. Wow threw me into bfa without even knowing what's going on, was lost for days till I just went to classic, it's been much better
[2:19:02] Sebleh: naguuraSip
[2:19:03] y0rge: is not
[2:19:07] gambitenjoyer: ?
[2:19:08] spooledup_: mythic is like playing ranked in some fps for PvE... and really learning a class takes quite some time imo I started back in BC as a little squirt and I didnt truly understand warlock until MoP
[2:19:11] y0rge: all you need to do
[2:19:15] y0rge: i spend 10 min on yt
[2:19:20] y0rge: to learn tactic
[2:19:24] Thoreya: did we see
[2:19:24] Sebleh: people don’t know how much implied knowledge and skill there is in playing endgame WoW lmao
[2:19:24] hasel93: dont feed the troll
[2:19:25] gambitenjoyer: Bro if you have 0 friends who play WoW. You barely even know how what website to look into for recruitment
[2:19:27] y0rge: all you need to knwo is learn mechs
[2:19:29] Thoreya: mike ybarra is leaving blizzard
[2:19:29] gambitenjoyer: How to optimize rotation
[2:19:31] gambitenjoyer: Get recruited
[2:19:31] Thoreya: :(
[2:19:32] DahFreak: xdd
[2:19:33] gambitenjoyer: y0rge
[2:19:35] gambitenjoyer: ur not serious
[2:19:38] Phleshh: in league you have to spend like 100 hours to get level 30 before ranked in league
[2:19:38] gambitenjoyer: u must be a healer bro
[2:19:38] xxxdabmaster69xxx: yeah the jump seems pretty tough from 0 to mythic raiding... i started playing fighting games in 2018 and the initial jump is the most difficult one :D
[2:19:38] jPrincey: @Naguura are you going to play smite 2
[2:19:40] Aspire121: all you need to do to play game well is play game well
[2:19:40] Qutje: @y0rge you have to spend 10 min on yt. doesn't count for the avr player that wishes to get into the harder gameplay
[2:19:40] 69DamnedDaniel68: hes just trollin lol
[2:19:43] Kuroz: that's learning the mythic fight, not starting from 0
[2:19:44] asurrraaa: @critmatic Yeah FFXIV is much more beginner friendly than WoW by a mile.
[2:19:44] Sierrakilo96: dats not comparable but yeah
[2:19:45] Jetofficially: @y0rge ok, how are you getting into a mythic guild with no exp of wow? answert that
[2:19:49] DahFreak: lil bro y0rge smoking crack today
[2:19:52] reggiepowa: league is like 20 hours, for mythic you need several tiers before you can even get into mythic raiding guild
[2:19:53] y0rge: i understand for soem peopel is hard to spend 10 min on yt
[2:19:55] gambitenjoyer: People want 95+ parses in multiple expansions to raid Mythic
[2:19:56] gambitenjoyer: lol
[2:19:57] Sebleh: @y0rge you’re crazy a video isn’t enough. there is so much muscle memory and knowledge you have to develop to play even M0 properly
[2:19:58] Lennerrt: you will loose all your sanity in league before you find out
[2:20:00] rewind10: Mythic raiding is more comparable with like playing with a decent team...
[2:20:01] y0rge: is liek 12 weeks of season 3
[2:20:02] CandleLightCat: yea dude some people just jump right in too XD everyone has that 1 guy in the group
[2:20:05] Thoreya: microsoft laying off 1900 employees, mike ybarra leaving :(
[2:20:09] y0rge: and people stil ldont know hc tact
[2:20:13] TwiXsteRTTV: @Naguura My brother started before 2months wow at all, and now hes 3k raider io and 9/9 heroic soon he will join some pugs for mythic+
[2:20:14] y0rge: sure
[2:20:15] rewind10: In cs or games like this
[2:20:18] gambitenjoyer: y0rge link your WCL, or stop typing
[2:20:19] totalecl1pse_: i mean it took me a a season
[2:20:20] gambitenjoyer: you're very silly dude
[2:20:24] bayhie: Do I have to play NE or Dwarf if I wanna push extreme keys?
[2:20:26] bingo_roswell: getting into raiding in general is hard. I’ve been playing wow for 2+ years and can’t find a raiding guild
[2:20:27] gambitenjoyer: and its becoming obvious you prob dont even play wow
[2:20:28] gambitenjoyer: and just type
[2:20:30] Jetofficially: hes completely skipped the part of getting into a mythic raiding guild, guy is on sheesh bong
[2:20:37] Galinnyr: we're getting one guyed lol
[2:20:38] 69DamnedDaniel68: logs?!1
[2:20:44] spooledup_: @bingo_roswell that part lol took me forever to find a guild that wants to raid
[2:20:50] nixotrixlover: why are you comparing ranked league to mythic raiding??? ranked league is like heroic at most
[2:20:54] Sabretoofs: @Naguura  one thing MEN do is say shit just to get a reaction out of women bc they LOVE when you react LOL
[2:21:07] Sebleh: @twixsterttv how much did you carry him and how much did you hold his hand and teach him to play?
[2:21:10] gambitenjoyer: If anyone started playing WoW 2 months ago, and is 3k IO. They are playing 8h+ a day which is 6 months of playtime for someone who plays 1-2h a day.
[2:21:12] gambitenjoyer: Simply put
[2:21:14] gambitenjoyer: People are delusional
[2:21:16] matt_xiv: 9/9 heroic to 9/9 mythic is a HUGE difference. heroic is super easy
[2:21:17] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:21:25] jPrincey: You guys are all silly :D
[2:21:25] forcetriangle: confirmed BM main
[2:21:26] Sebleh: because that’s what the difference is between some brand new player and someone with an active guide
[2:21:32] spooledup_: @nixotrixlover mythic doesnt get difficult really until mid 10s
[2:21:36] asurrraaa: Mythic raiding is harder TO DO.
[2:21:38] bingo_roswell: @spooledup_ yeah it’s like most guilds already have their people for like 8 years
[2:21:39] Sierrakilo96: @Naguura pls dat is not comparable to set mythic raiding and playing just ranked in lol
[2:21:42] xxxdabmaster69xxx: depends on what "2 months" mean :D 2 months of daylie grinding or 2 months of playing a little bit inbetween :D
[2:21:50] gambitenjoyer: @xxxdabmaster69xxx exactly, these people are very low IQ
[2:21:56] y0rge: @Naguura on what mythic raiding you talkign asbout ? sure top 10 is not for new player
[2:21:57] Seawolf607: I was a mythic raider and I am a potato FeelsGoodMan
[2:22:00] y0rge: top 500 is
[2:22:03] sw00p_tv: I honestly think most people are just messing with you
[2:22:08] asurrraaa: TO OPEN THAT DOOR. No one is saying it’s hard. We’re saying it’s hard to even get into that realm of raiding.
[2:22:16] bayhie: @Naguura Do I have to play NE or Dwarf if I wanna push extreme keys?
[2:22:20] gambitenjoyer: y0rge again, since top 500 guilds are easier for new players to join. Can you link your WCL/RIO? Since you're so good?
[2:22:21] forcetriangle: process to become mythic raider, much more too it
[2:22:21] critmatic: Ban em
[2:22:24] sh4ndooo: hey chat any tips about this !drop? I connected blizz acc, but still not connected on twitch.. Refresh button after connect is not working
[2:22:26] CandleLightCat: Yea dude we aint talking skill- We are talking LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION. Makes you great at warcraft lol
[2:22:36] asurrraaa: @candlelightcat Truuuuuuyy
[2:22:56] Sabrius_: plus mythic raiding requires schedule coordination with others beforehand. with league or counter strike you just queue up for ranked
[2:23:14] Sebleh: @bayhie yes pretty much
[2:23:18] thesavvygent: doing the thing NOTED
[2:23:21] Phleshh: you can play ranked in most games till you level your account
[2:23:25] gambitenjoyer: You won't even be able to find a guild, unless you already have a guild to have parses/logs
[2:23:28] spaeltchenbtw: i mean you cant play ranked without lvling too
[2:23:30] Sierrakilo96: you need lol account lv30 to play ranked
[2:23:32] gambitenjoyer: So you somehow need to pug than find a guild
[2:23:32] Jetofficially: @y0rge raiding guild who are 3/9 mythic want wowlogs parsing 90+ so youre not even getting into these guilds as a new player, what hash have you ingested ?
[2:23:34] bayhie: @Sebleh :(
[2:23:44] shawnwise: bruh
[2:23:47] bingo_roswell: finding a guild is super hard
[2:23:49] Sebleh: @bayhie you’ll be fine without them until mid 20s at least tho
[2:23:52] nixotrixlover: yes the learning curve ceiling of mmos are higher but your comparing the hardest content to just ranked, why not compare it to the hardest form of content in those games would be higher rated games... not just stepping into it
[2:23:58] shawnwise: I could hop into league today havent played in 12 years and go do ranked
[2:24:13] xxxdabmaster69xxx: gosh, i didn't want to trigger a whole discussion haha :D sorry
[2:24:14] brodershazam: I started in oktober and god 13 lvl 70 i love to explore the game and all the characters my m+ rating is only 700 thoe i main brew monk now and i dont have the balls to tank this week 😅
[2:24:16] shawnwise: how people not get this
[2:24:22] iunget: In DOTA you have to play 100 hr in unranked to be able to play ranked soooo
[2:24:37] gambitenjoyer: @nixotrixlover Dude you're braindead. The hardest content in WoW is Mythic Raiding, the hardest content in those games would be Ranked. Literally a perfect comparision. Obviously people of higher ranks have higher skill games, but its as "hard" for everyone playing against people in their elos lol
[2:24:38] shawnwise: yeah but then youd have to play DOTA
[2:24:44] deadsockss: wow is notoriously a slog to break into. let alone be mythic raid ready.

[2:24:49] y0rge: @Jetofficially wired i can get you  lkike 10 guild 4/9 that dotn cvsare for logs :) they just wants you in to play
[2:24:54] Jetofficially: changing the subject swiftly @Naguura what tea you drinking ?
[2:25:06] joshuwuahh: its just a higher barrier for entry
[2:25:22] Gladi127: I had to pop off for 20 mins, what happened with the 28? I see you didn't time it 😞
[2:25:27] asurrraaa: ummm that’s a lie lol. in DOTA you play 25 in un ranked games lol.
[2:25:44] Phleshh: in that case it take no time to play lfr buy game use free bost que up
[2:25:47] Lennerrt: makes sense yeah
[2:25:51] NotLebronJamess: you gotta level for 5 minutes and then you raid
[2:26:01] y0rge: sure if it is middle of exp sure can be hard
[2:26:08] TiPera: u boost a character and raid Kappa
[2:26:08] Somanie: @NotLebronJamess false
[2:26:11] iunget: @asurrraaa last time i checked it was 100 did i missed something?)

[2:26:18] tippyto3: out of all these flavors.. these kids choose salt
[2:26:31] Phleshh: Just buy game then queue lfr see your doing the raid ez
[2:26:35] LsWRLD420: @NotLebronJamess u can tell who dont play
[2:26:45] gambitenjoyer: @Phleshh how do you even know what the fuck LFR is when you first download the game bro lol
[2:26:45] asurrraaa: There isn’t a game that competes with WoW when it comes to preparations for M+ raiding. NO ONE IS SAYING ITS A GOOD THING. I think this is bad personally lol. it’s just reality.
[2:26:54] spaeltchenbtw: i feel like majority of people i raid with don't know anything of what they do LULW
[2:26:57] skolvttv: original take
[2:26:59] LsWRLD420: troll world here haha
[2:27:01] MrPodio: 100%
[2:27:03] gambitenjoyer: If u never played wow and u watch right now, literally just see the numbers
[2:27:03] knxzockt: Did you try CS 2?
[2:27:06] gambitenjoyer: they dont understand a thing
[2:27:07] gambitenjoyer: exactly
[2:27:12] Phleshh: @lirklol becsue i big as box telling you to go to adventure guide an telling you recommended activites tells you
[2:27:16] NotLebronJamess: lmao you can get 440-450 from a fresh level 70 ilvl in a few hours
[2:27:18] Jetofficially: yeah ... aimbot bonanza
[2:27:25] NotLebronJamess: ilvl
[2:27:26] WoozlesTV: @Naguura are you considered a "mythic raider", if your guild carries you through 2-3 bosses and your logs are awful?
[2:27:31] spooledup_: if you've never raided in WoW you're gonna spend the entire raid dead
[2:27:40] smorc22: i never see you play keys just scroll through lfg :(
[2:27:46] LsWRLD420: @NotLebronJamess yes you need 485+ for mythic raiding
[2:28:03] CandleLightCat: dbjLennyThumb dbjLennyhead
[2:28:06] asurrraaa: @lswrld420 That’s steep. I’d say 475.
[2:28:07] Rancidius: @NotLebronJamess if you completely understand the game and what to do or swipe. still wont be in high mythic or high end raids
[2:28:08] NotLebronJamess: if we’re talking about mythic raiding then sure you need 475-485 ilvl
[2:28:16] daynerrrrr: the nuance is completely missed yeah
[2:28:16] Somanie: you level from 1 to 70, you do heroics until you can do m0, you do m0 until you have ilvl for lfr, research lfr (hopefully so you don't suck), research class BiS lists and learn about logs and shit, etc.
[2:28:17] gambitenjoyer: Nah, ive tried streaming wow in discord for buddies who have no clue. What you're saying is 100% correct lol
[2:28:19] NotLebronJamess: I’m talking about Normal raids
[2:28:19] y0rge: cus it is caster role to e xplain it
[2:28:24] knxzockt: the worlds just doesn't understand us
[2:28:24] Somanie: there's so much to do before you could join a guild with a raid team
[2:28:26] xxxdabmaster69xxx: i should ask simpler questions in the future haha :D
[2:28:28] NotLebronJamess: if we’re talking about “raiding”
[2:28:33] y0rge: look on wow arena pvp
[2:28:34] LsWRLD420: @asurrraaa true to just get in to be in the good guillds with 90% parces tho
[2:28:36] roXingtoN: i played wow for like 15 years didnt play for some time now but i dont understand MDI one bit xD
[2:28:42] y0rge: have you everr watched arena pvp ?
[2:28:42] Dynender: WOW has the best gameplay, i love sitting in the capital cities waiting for queues
[2:28:44] deadsockss: + addons
[2:28:46] gambitenjoyer: y0rge
[2:28:49] CandleLightCat: If i die it is definately SOMEONE elses fault!
[2:28:50] y0rge: howhow they explain ev ery thing
[2:28:55] Kahlandra: the casters can make comments about things ike that but they cant do it every single time it gets boring
[2:29:00] reggiepowa: what is casters job
[2:29:01] spooledup_: @CandleLightCat always the healers fault.
[2:29:01] Somanie: they commentate everything, but they don't explain everything
[2:29:01] Hekistylz: casters would need to be eminem to try and explain a MDI pull
[2:29:05] YungGuacadile: in no other sport does a caster EXPLAIN the sport to you
[2:29:13] y0rge: i dont say you need to say he ca st fire ball
[2:29:20] shawnwise: it is most certainly not the casters job. Imagine tuning into a basketball game and expecting the casters to explain each play the teams are running
[2:29:22] Lennerrt: yeah explain to me like im 5
[2:29:23] y0rge: yes
[2:29:25] Jetofficially: LOL imagine that .... "why you not know mechanics?" "caster didnt really explain them to me" HAHAHAHA
[2:29:26] Kahlandra: that would be the least entertaining stream i would want to go deaf
[2:29:27] xxxdabmaster69xxx: if casters start explaining every pull they would have to talk faster then eminem :D
[2:29:28] skolvttv: If casters explain wow in MDI then ppl who are actually interested stop watching
[2:29:28] gambitenjoyer: This guy can barely type a sentence LUL
[2:29:35] gambitenjoyer: But raiding is easy
[2:29:36] gambitenjoyer: apparently
[2:29:39] jessyrainbow: @xxxdabmaster69xxx jessyr2Hi
[2:29:41] roXingtoN: people watching MDI are not people that never played WoW before, that makes no sense
[2:29:43] MrNaco: You'd have to go even lower
[2:29:44] nixotrixlover: i wouldnt consider someone whos not fully cleared the tier on mythic atleast once a mythic raider
[2:29:46] Treviathon: A casters job is describe, that may include how the games works /shrug
[2:29:47] Jeybls: yunaHmm What is frontal? What is despell?
[2:29:49] xTheSpire: How whats the Addon/Weakaura that shows u how the TEamcomp is in the groups?
[2:29:50] Sebleh: the casters explain MDI at an advanced level and people complain about how boring it is. entry level explanations would cause riots lmao
[2:29:51] Dynender: what is MDI
[2:29:53] Somanie: @Kahlandra yoooo fellow Z mod!! <3
[2:29:55] KinarPT: Hey @naguura how's it going??
[2:29:59] Kuroz: !groups
[2:29:59] KinarPT: Afternoon!
[2:29:59] StreamElements: Group finder wa : https://wago.io/klC4qqHaF the weakaura isn't getting updated. https://wago.io/JhmeKOgMw (dragonflight version) or use premade group filter it does the same thing.
[2:30:01] skolvttv: Sports casters dont explain the rules of the sport
[2:30:01] xxxdabmaster69xxx: @jessyrainbow oh hi jessy :D
[2:30:06] MrNaco: not "this mob casts a frontal" but "A frontal is an ability that casts in a cone from the front"
[2:30:09] KinarPT: Hey  everyone naguuraLove naguuraLove
[2:30:12] jessyrainbow: @xxxdabmaster69xxx jessyr2Love
[2:30:13] Jimmyy__: Dota has a separate "new player broadcast" (at least in past TIs) which is an interesting idea - but definitely not for a "main cast"...
[2:30:19] xxxdabmaster69xxx: @jessyrainbow <3 :D

[2:30:38] asurrraaa: I wonder what WoW raiding would be with no addons
[2:30:41] Balkissimo: ive been playing WoW for well over 10 years now ... PvE oriented with some expansions and tiers being focused on PvP ... im fully versed in all PvE aspects, but the moment i see PvP tournament (even though i did PvP myself last tier) - i have no idea what is going on and what are the synergies
[2:30:42] roXingtoN: the average m+ player would probably be offended by casters explaining stuff likeviewers are dumb lmao

[2:56:28] Tayyun: he did leave
[2:56:32] Sebleh: Ybarra resigned
[2:56:34] critmatic: Daaaaamn right
[2:56:38] ImmortalRose1: Not by any means defending any large corporations on their hiring processes and what not, but it is also extremely common, depending on the company, to allocate Q4 budgets towards seaonal hires, and once those seasonal contracts expire seaonal layoffs arent specified in the total "layoff" number. Its extremely common practice
[2:56:39] midcore_tv: hard to say. he quit according to his tweet but there's always office politics
[2:56:46] Sebleh: another lead blizz person also resigned
[2:56:48] jbenson444: resigned so he didn't get fired

[2:57:40] midcore_tv: maybe he was like "if you go through with this i'll tender my resignation" and microsoft was like ok resignation accepted
[2:57:55] Railey_1990: usually a cxo never gets laid off, they all usually "leave on their own". in order to get laid of as cxo you gotta do a really shitty job
[2:58:01] y0rge: i feel truth is in t he middle i dont think they will ever say he was released

[3:31:32] mika01: LUL
[3:31:33] nevernude1: I wonder why he is leaving, beacuse of the layoffs or was it always gonna happen after the merger
[3:31:40] trollinmyimp: Microsoft just laid off 1900 people across all it's divisions.
[3:31:45] Burnprof: lizzKEKW lizzKEKW lizzKEKW
[3:31:50] Valiena: !tirolmasd

[3:32:05] Vile_: Considering how they handled the Bungie thing? Yeah, he doesn't like Microsoft lmao
[3:32:09] Elembry_us: elembryus subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:32:12] Saqir_: smh on youtube you cant hear the music
[3:32:14] Sebleh: yeah I agree
[3:32:17] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[3:32:25] trollinmyimp: The sad part ois they canceled the survival game they were working on
[3:32:27] Kuroz: @imsaqir copyright reasons
[3:32:30] devilyn_x: @imsaqir she cant stream this music on youtube
[3:32:30] Sebleh: it sounds like he doesn’t agree with what they’re doing on this.
[3:32:34] surselith: It sounds like other people are being let go also, so might not be voluntary.
[3:32:45] mika01: or got a better offer
[3:32:45] BizBichou: for an interesting comparison; microsoft gaming's layoffs are about 9% of the employees - similar to 11% at riot
[3:32:51] Elembry_us: :)
[3:32:55] Sebleh: which could all be a front. I’ve seen some blizz employees say not so nice things about him.
[3:32:58] Saqir_: ohhhh ok i thought she didnt know :P just wanted to help
[3:33:02] Sebleh: on socials of course
[3:33:07] Toradin: he worked on this surv game too and MC kiiled it  and was mad about it)))
[3:33:17] Sebleh: @bizbichou yeah every single tech/media layoff has been 8-12% of staff
[3:33:22] lucynsol: is there any plan on who is going to takeover?
[3:33:49] nevernude1: Maybe he is gonna become a fulltime streamer!
[3:33:52] devilyn_x: he has an agreement signed too, so he cant say any reasons. i work in hr and do these kinds of contracts
[3:34:06] Vile_: Absolutely, unless he says something specifically, this is ALL speculation.
[3:34:08] Falanni_: think layoffs are pretty normal after big mergers
[3:34:13] seaendithas8080: maybe he got a girlfriend
[3:34:31] plaguedot: do we know why did he leave? ImTyping

[3:35:02] puntualus: elpapi27Hola
[3:35:09] trollinmyimp: Whelp how much do we want to speculate how this will effect the trio of expansions for WoW now?
[3:35:16] Sebleh: right. like @devilyn_x he probably won’t be able to speak about it
[3:35:35] Sebleh: so a “gg wp” is the best he can do for now
[3:35:47] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:35:54] Moonyfangs: who are we talking about?? also good morning from the west coast
[3:36:07] Andy_Eu: this was likely in the pipelines prior to the announcements of expansions
[3:36:07] BizBichou: @Falanni_ sometimes mergers come with clauses that state that existing employees in the company being bought will not be laid off within a certain time, but idk how well those work NOTED
[3:36:11] trollinmyimp: We don't know yet how many from blizzard were let go though. What is the new president isn't on board with the direction they were going?
[3:36:13] Falanni_: maybe he just didnt want to have Phil Spencer as his boss :D
[3:36:15] devilyn_x: yeah shouldnt affect the game at all, their money comes from the game so they wont risk releases
[3:36:16] Moonyfangs: he left?
[3:36:17] Anisava: Ich muss erstmal los. Falls Du etwas nicht lesen kannst, schreib mir gern^^
[3:36:22] TotallyNotRaien: they make expacs too in advance for it to make much difference
[3:36:35] MBG_95: its 8% of Microsoft gaming workforce, we dont even know how many are part of the Blizzard - WoW team
[3:36:45] Moonyfangs: lmfao, he was like F off to the devs who wanted to work from home, if he’s gone that’s good for devs
[3:37:01] tertfjert: 255k dps overall seems abit low?
[3:37:10] Sebleh: @mbg_95 we also don’t know that they’re not. We do know Ybarra and one of the old school Blizzard lead designers resigned tho
[3:37:17] plaguedot: we have Holy valeriaHEART valeriaHEART valeriaHEART
[3:37:24] Kahlandra: every part of it
[3:37:29] or3g: as long as he's not leaving them high and dry and they had time to prep someone to take over there will be 0 effect on all blizzard related things.
[3:37:30] Voldraal: it's microsoft gaming
[3:37:30] CoffeeASAP: From what I read it was predominantly Blizzard
[3:37:33] Voldraal: which is all of them now
[3:37:36] BizBichou: microsoft gaming specifically, we don't know how much of it is blizzard
[3:37:38] MineralPass: When "The War Within" comes out, will all of the Dragonflight gear become obsolete?
[3:37:39] trollinmyimp: yes. The three microsoft gaming arms. xbox, zenimax and Activision/blizz.
[3:37:46] Sebleh: @moonyfangs you realize it was not Ybarra’s call to make them go back to the office? that was all above him.
[3:37:48] MBG_95: the Verge article said Blizzard/Xbox/Activision
[3:37:49] Saqir_: COPIUM
[3:37:56] MineralPass: ^
[3:38:19] Kuroz: ye
[3:38:24] Burnprof: the correct answer to that statement is "YOU are a bit low."
[3:38:29] Andy_Eu: 37.1k healing from sanguine seems a bit low?
[3:38:43] Sebleh: wait we did open the window?
[3:38:52] Sebleh: someone said you didn’t naguuraWeirdChamp

[3:39:49] TotallyNotRaien: shouldve done all the damage by yourself
[3:39:51] SyCor3: also if stuff happens and u farm death u will just have less dps
[3:39:52] plaguedot: i though shes from germany

[5:18:32] Noradria: Nagony revive time?

[5:18:39] censiGFY: Meanwhile i dont even press feint i lose 40% hp on that thing at this level KEKW
[5:18:52] Aimboater: or a shield from church man
[5:19:01] swisha1123: Hey Naguura! What are your thoughts on the affixes this week? Good week?
[5:19:06] R3w4s: yeah thats the moonkin experience you do good dmg but have to spend 1/3 of ur GCDs to bear/moonkin form xD
[5:19:14] korotame: @TheGame402 but than you just bearly survive Kappa Kappa
[5:19:16] TheGame402: bear form is probably the worst feeling "defensive" in the game
[5:19:21] psz90: Yeah great week sanguine fort
[5:19:26] nimmiemage: ez timed
[5:19:30] psz90: Lul

[5:19:53] psz90: Bear form is trash
[5:20:00] gAbbAsHoW: and you dont get to play the game when into it
[5:20:04] Sebleh: Ursine Vigor should be the full bear HP value and last 20s for pve
[5:20:11] Sebleh: I’ve been cooking and I like that
[5:20:14] R3w4s: its one of the best defensives and one of the worst ones at the same time
[5:20:19] R3w4s: its actually kinda impressive
[5:20:47] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:20:48] TheGame402: isn't it more like 2 because you need to get out too
[5:20:49] Shpicey: warrior has something similar with defensive stance
[5:21:03] psz90: Hunters defensives are gcd
[5:21:04] R3w4s: yeah bear form is actually 2 gcds xd
[5:21:05] MBG_95: I would say Most are on gcd, most mage ones are, same as paladin
[5:21:09] Neztea: shaman has the same issue kinda
[5:21:10] Fausstty: Defensive stance is trash
[5:21:25] Fausstty: It's just a lame attempt to hit us with nostalgia, Hey look, stances!
[5:21:35] Shpicey: would u rather have bear form or defensive stance
[5:21:36] Fausstty: You ain't convincing me def stance is good
[5:21:46] censiGFY: could be worse, look at shaman wolf form. Gotta press it 5s before the dmg happens and stays in that form KEKW
[5:21:50] ActuallyNate: ActuallyNate subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:21:56] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[5:22:07] TheGame402: only upside is that it feels better than ghost wolf
[5:22:11] swisha1123: 10% damage reduction and 10% less damage done something like that
[5:22:18] Fausstty: 15% damage reduction
[5:22:25] swisha1123: correct
[5:22:44] psz90: D stance for warrior changes your char xmog to wear a skirt
[5:22:51] Aimboater: well yeah cos bear form is -90% damage done
[5:23:04] Neztea: exactly lol
[5:23:04] AxynQ: the worst part is that in bear form u are basiclly afk
[5:23:19] TheGame402: Just give shamans and boomies 1 more def cd, why do they have to suffer more than any other DPS class
[5:23:21] psz90: U can moonfire in bear form
[5:23:22] Shpicey: is 15% dr worth more or the bear form hp/armor gain
[5:23:30] bareuheldig: how much you do when dead?
[5:23:32] R3w4s: gotta mangle Kappa
[5:23:38] Thalinan: thats cursed actually
[5:23:43] Aimboater: is it worth playing leaf?
[5:23:44] TotallyNotRaien: would you like to see a trait that lets you use moonkin spells in bear form but it goes on a CD?
[5:23:46] Plonkz: would you rather loose bear and get a new CD?
[5:23:55] MBG_95: wow, such smart point
[5:23:56] Fausstty: Def stance is still trash
[5:24:03] swisha1123: new boomkins in pvp struggle the most with bear weaving against melee due to not being able to do dmg
[5:24:04] spekkiii: i hate this entence bro " how much dmg u do when dead"
[5:24:08] Neztea: bear form is 2 gcds or one? to keep doing damage
[5:24:10] spekkiii: like bro it just sucks, the gameplay sucks
[5:24:23] gAbbAsHoW: @Neztea two if you want to get into boomy
[5:24:23] codydoubleu: guess we wait for hero talents to give bear-weaving dps Sadge
[5:24:26] arkyre: are those party frames elvui?

[5:44:04] skeeld: naguura why are people doing this side in this dungeon
[5:44:14] skeeld: it seems so miserable from the two times ive tried it
[5:44:15] breaccglas123: Call me for the ATAL 25 Naguura :D
[5:44:18] Sebleh: @skeeld it's the route for high keys
[5:44:36] TheGame402: Its way faster in an organized group
[5:44:37] skeeld: i liked the other side more
[5:44:43] freepeeches: Those effects are so pretry
[5:44:45] Brolly33: nice to see some high keys, i'm to lazy to play them myself :)
[5:44:47] TheGame402: but also way harder if you are not organized

[5:45:09] skeeld: can any pets/summons tank the juggernauts?
[5:45:25] TheGame402: @skeeld i think you can even bait it with monk statues
[5:45:30] TheGame402: or maybe they fixed it
[5:45:35] skeeld: yeah thats what it looks like this monk is doing
[5:45:47] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:46:34] TheGame402: i assumed they will fix it because in everbloom you can't bait the casters with the monk statue. At least didn't work when we tried it
[5:46:38] gingermuntz: PrimeYouDontSay PrimeYouDontSay PrimeYouDontSay
[5:46:42] TheGame402: i mean the berserkers
[5:46:53] ghostdomii: do you have tips to farm gold?
[5:47:02] skeeld: i feel like if they fix that this becomes kind of impossible no?
[5:47:03] luxumbra69: do the juggernauts not charge to u if you stand in melee?
[5:47:05] skeeld: on high fort keys at least
[5:47:07] luxumbra69: or is that the ox statue
[5:47:09] skeeld: they do a ton of dmg
[5:47:37] cypheredtv: @luxumbra69 they jump to the farthest player iirc, but can be baited with ox statue and warlock/hunter pets as well
[5:47:40] TheGame402: @skeeld If you track the cast time you can just be moving as a range when it casts and it wont hit you
[5:47:46] Fallen_o7: resto or monk is bis for ad
[5:47:49] skeeld: ohhh thats a good idea
[5:48:09] luxumbra69: @TheGame402 yeah, but pretty big dps loss. good to know you can force your monk player to run ox statue
[5:48:11] KareiTV: Les Schtroupmfs
[5:48:24] itsClubby: SeemsGood working as intended
[5:48:24] luxumbra69: nice tech.

[5:50:50] luxumbra69: i feel like bear is good for one shots, but if it's rot damage you'd be much better refrowthing yourself
[5:50:54] Sebleh: resto has tres now
[5:51:13] Ryuwars: denizens count as well learned that the hard way
[5:51:18] Sebleh: you didn’t think it was weird that the shared balance/resto tree for the expac was based around treants?

[6:56:59] Sebleh: the keys toast.
[6:56:59] Toadcop: yes tanks fault 100%
[6:57:09] xSamuraiMKx: I personally feel like a kick that is just one kick for a boss can be for anyone. why blame someone else when you could have done something about it. it’s a team effort.
[6:57:12] Kahlandra: ah, makes sense
[6:57:14] Toadcop: he could be a paladin and cr you
