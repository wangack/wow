[1:48:27] kaoreal: Yeah SoD is gonna pop off. Is there a release date or estimate on p2?
[1:48:27] knappster15: SOD streams getting 10x more views than retail
[1:48:29] knappster15: its not a flop
[1:48:31] reaperz14: Dude's trolling lol sod is not  a flop
[1:48:34] iloveyalunn: I think DF broke records too
[1:48:34] voldrino: There could be!
[1:48:53] mussyduss: classic wow community behavior
[1:48:58] TheEyeVII: df didn't sell as well as sl but they had good retention
[1:48:59] ssspriest: classic+ has a better name its called retail
[1:49:00] voldrino: No bud SOD isn't Classic+ and they act like it is!
[1:49:01] Steakslive: classic plus is cata fresh server
[1:49:04] mouliani: @kaoreal feb 8
[1:49:06] Itankarenas: there was like a million different idea of classic+
[1:49:12] maybethistimepls: 1 mount that they sell makes more than most games whole year
[1:49:12] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:49:26] voldrino: Well then you will never get a real high quality classic +! Since ur ok with SOD!
[1:49:26] Lordshaftington: what did people expect it to be that it wasn't?
[1:49:35] voldrino: It will just turn into retail
[1:49:38] wowfyne: I think SoD is really good but they are limited a lot by the fact that any base changes affect classic era too
[1:49:41] saintopiaa: cant wait for the 100% windfury proc chance rune
[1:49:41] Ameratzu: its a step in the right direction
[1:49:46] wowfyne: so for what we got its amazing imo
[1:49:47] ProteinPlayground: its just another Season lets be real
[1:49:49] TheEyeVII: thing is sod is meant to end, like any classic spin they'll never invest into a wow version that doesn't have a wowtoken & a shop, literally never imo @cdewx
[1:49:55] Itankarenas: all the abilities are great
[1:49:58] Itankarenas: YEP
[1:49:59] zachgamegodx: cdew you’re going way too ham
[1:50:02] Azzulon: @cdewx i just think classic and mods like sod its just a ilusion, game was not better, you love the memorys of playing it
[1:50:04] zachgamegodx: it’s just 1 guy
[1:50:09] koonakeenay: also makes you wonder if its a soft launch + with hero talents to really mix up retail or summ
[1:50:14] paladinpengu: SoD is really fun and I bet they’re going to actually start going ham on adding stuff once we hit 60 they’re just taking it easy atm
[1:50:14] willc13x: facts
[1:50:25] spujetti: Lets be real here. Anyone complaining about sod is probably just a sod hunter player sick of getting nerfed lol
[1:50:32] knappster15: most caster rotations in Classic is spamming 1 ability for 5 minutes
[1:50:32] voldrino: SOD is actually GODlike!
[1:50:34] koonakeenay: being able to have some other classes abilities in retail would be sick af
[1:50:38] knappster15: SOD is actually intereseting
[1:50:48] forever32: LOVE THE PlAN ....RUN we got ya
[1:50:51] Itankarenas: @spujetti prob warrs sad they wont be top of dmg meter by double dps anymore
[1:50:54] voldrino: Everyone thinks SOD is the most amazing game to ever be invented! Well done Blizz, don't change a thing!
[1:51:10] Itankarenas: @voldrino touch grass dude. jesus
[1:51:23] paladinpengu: can’t wait for level 60 on SoD to see how it pops off
[1:52:01] voldrino: I tough 🖖instead, but u can have the grass lol
[1:52:03] spujetti: Its funny because it reminds me of arpg leagues. At the start everyone is super stoked on it and then when the content gets stale near the end of the patch cycle they say its boring
[1:52:16] spujetti: like yeah. its a seasonal game. youre gonna run out of stuff to do
[1:52:43] voldrino: People will play it! But it won't be as great as it could have been. That's okay to say lol
[1:52:47] Itankarenas: @voldrino wow dude, save some pussy for the rest of us
[1:52:51] zachgamegodx: me and my friend who played all the classics together but now are back to retail tried sod, leveled to 10 and were like.. we’re sick of leveling in classuc wow lol this is shit. think we’ve had enough Classic for a while
[1:53:13] zachgamegodx: some ppl@may be the same
[1:53:17] chaos_jeeves: app freeze or just me
[1:53:20] Vexumx: who’s the toughest person to juke kick on? know you juke a lot and if ya didn’t team would die lol @cdewx
[1:53:20] voldrino: @zachgamegodx 💯
[1:53:22] spujetti: im the opposite. sod is actually the only way i could ever level a classic character
[1:53:26] Itankarenas: @chaos_jeeves just u

[1:53:49] morphz____: 100 MONTHS
[1:53:56] TheEyeVII: i'll only believe they're serious about sod's future past just a sub retention metric for the quarterly reports, once they add a wow token to it & a shop, otherwise not financially viable imo & never will be @cdewx
[1:53:56] Itankarenas: Mes' rotational flame is great
[1:54:09] zachgamegodx: under the weder

[1:55:32] millsy4444: but... but... they added runes!
[1:55:56] itsmacx: sub retention or good business you be the judge
[1:55:58] zachgamegodx: cdew you’re not in an arena yet
[1:56:11] iloveyalunn: Its obviously financially viable or a mega corporation like blizzard would have pulled the plug on it
[1:56:23] Rentun: dewRag dewRag dewRag dewRag
[1:56:58] mitchell_xd: air tranq ddos
[1:57:42] TheEyeVII: no you misunderstand, by "invest" I mean xpacs & significant dev time on sod similar to retail, as in sod is the future of wow type of investment, that's not financially viable vs retail imo
[1:57:58] iRicco: what fingers do u use the most to press ur spell? out if how many presses do you use ur thumb once? pinky? @cdewx  index?
[1:58:03] zachgamegodx: if you had a comp named after you, which would it be
[1:58:08] knappster15: 0% chance
[1:58:08] spujetti: No shot the team on sod is anywhere close to retail
[1:58:12] mitchell_xd: r u hyped for next expansion
[1:58:21] morphz____: Zone development is the most time consuming part of an expac I think
[1:58:28] kaoreal: Yeah it's a few bells and whistles and look how many people it brought back
[1:58:33] spujetti: You are severely mistaken about how many man hours stuff takes
[1:58:33] iRicco: @cdewx do u use the arrow keys on ur keyboard to move or wasd?
[1:58:39] zachgamegodx: @iricco you have a fetish or something?
[1:58:55] TheEyeVII: @morphz____ ya that's why I think sod will never go anywhee past just runes & phases, then they do a new classic "spin" over & over
[1:58:58] robdudeguylol: thoughts of taking pvp row out of vault?
[1:59:05] iloveyalunn: @cdew do you use a mouse or a joystick
[1:59:15] Mechgyrasaur: @iRicco that's dyllbar that uses arrow keys KEKW
[1:59:18] iRicco: @cdewx  have y tried foot peddals? if so, please send pic of them with shoes off
[1:59:36] kaoreal: Do you have totemic recall bound to gas pedal or clutch pedal?

[2:00:31] kaoreal: Maximum flag carry experience

[3:25:49] Yoskexz: when is it a good time to burrow for dmg/kill?
[3:26:17] Yoskexz: i want to see you burrow in when he triple blinds/sweep
[3:26:26] zachgamegodx: it happened at 3:08: in your vod
[3:26:31] jasonkbkt: I swear every time your healing on sham the game intensity is fking nuts
[3:27:08] iSoappe: Is uusing big rock boi useful? feel like it just fucks Drs
[3:27:19] voldrino: You should not be able to kill the healing totems.
[3:27:39] jasonkbkt: Lol
[3:27:40] tmiller87: drop reset for totems
[3:27:50] jasonkbkt: That's fked up
[3:27:54] iSoappe: I feel like every time I use earth elemental the stun messes up DRs. Maybe I am the only one
[3:28:22] waffleberryx: i been loving short totemic recall
[3:28:25] aod0311x: dwhats the bind everyone uses for targeting totems and other peripheral things, like maybe shadowfiend
[3:28:43] dAD3VaSt8R: !followage
[3:28:49] iSoappe: I am ele but its the shamman side of tree same for all?
[3:29:00] Legendary_Fish: What makes you choose troll?
[3:29:05] SpeedyMcD: i think its kinda bs that players can kill shamans main forms of healing.
[3:29:10] Yoskexz: burrow for the kill

[3:30:02] napkin4u: like 0.4
[3:30:52] Ronyxoxo_: Don't you think that the Spirit Link Totem already needs a rework at this point in the game? either it doesn't work or it reacts very slowly to balance the hp
[3:32:04] Neekslol: feels like it pulses the effect
[3:32:17] knappster15: spirit link turns 1 kill into a triple kill
[3:32:19] tmiller87: imagine an earthen that attached itself to the person you used it on
[3:32:24] PeptoAbysmal: it def is delayed
[3:32:26] nutz_hang_uneven: just play a good healer

[3:35:31] voldrino: I kinda think so
[3:35:35] OptiTV_: spirit link value depends on how much a health bar is worth, but when a ww can go through 4 healthbars in 10 sec then it isn't worth that much anymore
[3:35:39] zachgamegodx: he’s gone mad 2% avoidance kekW

[3:37:57] OptiTV_: WALL?!?!?!! lontarW lontarW lontarW
[3:37:58] Hoodwinkel: @flaccidx if all 3 got cleave then link would be no good
[3:38:03] voldrino: Short wall or long wall? If short then use more often!
[3:38:09] Zorvie: You, reckful, and the gang, in the skill capped house. Miss those good old days. I still remember the incident with someone like eating your soup or chef boy'r'de or something. lmao

[3:38:43] Klonkk: Have you considered winning?
[3:38:46] voldrino: They are questions

[3:39:35] sanatalive: stop playing solo shuffle
[3:39:40] voldrino: Well he didn't wall and died so that's valid

[3:41:57] tonyya1337: Ty <3
[3:43:43] Zeneri: anyone know wtf is wrong with solo shuffle as healer? i went 4-2 gained 0 rating but i did lose mmr
[3:43:55] deafnflaccid: ss as healer is fuuucked
[3:45:46] OptiTV_: talented blizz dev boys accidentally disabled all inflation the past 2 weeks after they did the manual inflation
[3:45:57] chubmax: that’s confirmed??
[3:46:07] Applezbtw: @Zeneri did u have a losing streak before that lobby?
[3:46:24] MaybeRespect: @Zeneri it's same for high CR DPS. I'm 2600 i go 5-1 +0 4-2 is loss
