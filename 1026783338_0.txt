[1:11:07] KVANNORWICK: Do not envy those guys at all
[1:11:07] Hazno: @asteos no, the $15 is if you want to progress your character to TBC AND you want to clone a copy of your character to remain on Classic
[1:11:07] asteos: oh wait isnt it to clone ur character?
[1:11:10] 91Niki: @MetallicusGaming Expecting people to read in 2021 LUL you have too much faith in people haha

[1:11:42] Hazno: @asteos progressing to TBC or staying on Classic itself is free for all characters, it only costs you if you want both

[1:12:13] Mygdrayl: people are already confuse about the cloning system and the classic Era or TBC classic
[1:12:14] asteos: 15 is by far bettere then 30$
[1:12:20] Swiftytrigger: best question is
[1:12:23] Sonatta: i'm just disappointed there's no physical edition
[1:12:25] Swiftytrigger: when can i buy my boost
[1:12:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: just wait till server crash you get in then get logged out bc of crash then have to wait to be logged back in again LUL
[1:12:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: someone would have bugged it out and got a boost in classic era by mistake
[1:12:30] Shugaze: Zygor still hasnt updated for prepatch
[1:12:33] Jessethoth: Tauren paladin was 2010, Cataclysm.

[1:13:24] Red_Dead_Redeem: when did they make undead paladins Kappa
[1:13:26] BaldPanda360: im more excited for TBC then i was classic, but i also started when TBC launched.
[1:13:34] Boccardo316: Shadowlands hit 1 million too
[1:13:35] Ragnarage95: towelliee do you have a list of peripherals you use
[1:13:39] Korupcija_: 2 million for sure
[1:13:40] Stonefather: @sirmeow00 Those are called DKs Keepo
[1:13:41] truxcat: i could see wotlk being big
[1:13:44] jerexify: @Towelliee You've been streaming long enough to know that any time streamers get ANYTHING the normal person doesn't get, people are gonna get tilted. lol
[1:13:45] northern__soul: Oh in that case i will pay for my 2 toons
[1:13:47] Jessethoth: I think BC is going to be way more hype personally, there are a metric fuckload of people that wanted Classic just to have BC.

[1:13:55] magemaster225: need that deluxe edition to hit the shop
[1:13:56] Jessethoth: Now ON TWITCH I dunno.
[1:13:58] Korupcija_: if Kungen comes back might even hit 5 million
[1:13:59] Shugaze: i think alot of the retail market will come in TBC
[1:14:00] NanotronRofl: Yeah, I could definitely see wotlk go very big
[1:14:04] 91Niki: @jerexify People get tilted over anything and everything yeah
[1:14:05] dooks98: It might retain more ppl
[1:14:06] Stonefather: BC is just a pitstop waiting for Wrath
[1:14:07] Wh1rly: im not even going to play to be honest
[1:14:08] Jessethoth: Most of the Classic hype was TO GET to BC.
[1:14:10] aeyt: just waiting for 9.1 Sadge
[1:14:15] jeziorek: cause tbc os not do casual
[1:14:16] asteos: yeah i started at bc
[1:14:19] krytsi: See I didnt play Vanilla, I started in TBC so all my hype is for TBC
[1:14:22] stealthx23: yea no where near as much hype then classic
[1:14:28] asteos: so i have more nostalgia for bc then i did classic personally
[1:14:28] Jessethoth: I mean, out of a shitload of Classic fans I talked to they agreed it was to get here.
[1:14:31] Hazno: @sarah_1111 note that you don't have to pay to progress your characters to TBC, only if you want to clone characters to Classic-only realms while they progress on to TBC
[1:14:31] BaldPanda360: WotLK will be huge. hopefully itll be the last classic they launch for a while though
[1:14:33] Masqerader: also how many times can you do naxx over and over and not be bored already
[1:14:40] Red_Dead_Redeem: I started playing in Wrath so TBC will be new for me
[1:14:40] northern__soul: I started at bc so doing classic was supper cool
[1:14:42] Mitune: wotlk will probably break records for hype numbers
[1:14:45] Shugaze: tbc is a good vanilla/retail mix
[1:14:47] mavericks312: the huge hypetrain will be wrath classic
[1:14:51] Znza: @BaldPanda360 i know its a leak but it should only be a trilogy so wotlk should be last
[1:14:51] Jessethoth: That's true though, we're more efficient, as Asmon put it "it's a solved game".
[1:14:52] NanotronRofl: Think Cata classic is a part of their rotation aswell @BaldPanda360
[1:14:55] broopyd: For some reason im super hyped about isle of queldanas dailies, thats where I think im gonna get my biggest nostalgia trip
[1:15:07] DrMantisTBaggin: Wrath was the peak subscriber count right? thatll be the most anticipated
[1:15:08] Korupcija_: can't wait for wrath, much better than bc
[1:15:14] asteos: yeah totally
[1:15:18] Hikh_17: is hc dungeon gear > 60 epics?
[1:15:26] Hazno: @DrMantisTBaggin back then, yes, but Shadowlands surpassed it
[1:15:27] Mosoner: @jessethoth There was nothing of any hype before Naxx back in vanilla
[1:15:29] Jessethoth: I think there'll be a surge to original Classic as well, a lot of streamers and their communities will move on to BC more.
[1:15:30] qualybased: good way to put it
[1:15:31] Jarless: @BroopyD me too!
[1:15:33] akazom: what's the expected uptime on prepatch?
[1:15:35] dalaraz: @Hikh_17 yeah

[1:15:49] northern__soul: nowt special
[1:15:55] asteos: i dno i wish i played classsic bu the raid just dont seem as interesting compared to retails
[1:16:04] DrMantisTBaggin: @Hazno gotcha
[1:16:07] Roccobro: @Towelliee is todays pre-patch start the less xp from 20-60?
[1:16:12] Jessethoth: @Mosoner I talked to a LOT of people that said shit like "Man this could go to BC!" or "I hope it gets to Wrath!"
[1:16:15] bundemout: what addon shows mining spots?
[1:16:18] Hazno: @Roccobro yes
[1:16:22] Roccobro: sweet
[1:16:23] Mosoner: @jessethoth oh you talking in Classic, yeah in that case you right. Thought you were talking about Vanilla wow

[1:16:41] aeyt: mop would be Pog
[1:16:42] Masqerader: just give me Legion again, and I am good or MOP
[1:16:47] Shugaze: I believe TBC is where most players get their nostalgia from

[1:16:52] Tecni: BFA classic hype!
[1:16:55] bundemout: @cabalish  ty

[1:18:14] akazom: what's the expected server uptime on prepatch?
[1:18:15] Pathwriter: Private servers 4 classes made up 95% of glads so I expect people to get bored of it fast.

[1:18:58] Verynicepotato: Duel spec Sadge
[1:19:00] deltadracona: looking forward to leveling a blood elf paladin, sad that i have to wait 19 hours to get my sub back, on the other hand, ill skip the queu's
[1:19:01] Znza: dampening had to happen cuz the gnarly numbers id imagine?
[1:19:02] dooks98: blizz is soo bad at making somechanges tho lol
[1:19:02] asteos: he saw a game
[1:19:03] Stonefather: #Somechanges Add DKs early Keepo
[1:19:04] Red_Dead_Redeem: I can't wait to start leveling my shammy
[1:19:05] mr3machine: Dual spec would have been so nice :(
[1:19:06] Kize_Gaming: AOE looting would be nice though tbh
[1:19:07] tenmillion: dual spec within first few months, @Towelliee
[1:19:08] truxcat: i wish they would add it
[1:19:10] Erielle04: I hate dampening
[1:19:10] Ramdorpser: As a tank I really would love dual spec
[1:19:13] magemaster225: do you think in wrath LFG gets in at launch or at the end like originally
[1:19:17] cordawg: Duel spec is also gross.  We need that gold sink in the game.
[1:19:17] Hazno: yeah, I would like AoE looting to be implemented

[1:19:21] Sonatta: i want AoE looting :)
[1:19:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: also prot pally for horde
[1:19:30] Nimz83: So what will happen when we get to the point that achievements are in. I wonder if Blizzard is going to allow some of the stuff to transfer to your main character. Like title you get in BC.
[1:19:36] jairogue: Only change I would like is to have Dual spec @Towelliee
[1:19:41] Ramdorpser: What is wrath LFG vs TBC LFG?
[1:19:43] cordawg: You guys want all this stuff, but its what destroyed Retail.
[1:19:56] Znza: if they gave us the option to release and never have lfg would you vote for it @Towelliee
[1:20:03] Enraig: THC LFG is more like pre-made groups on retail
[1:20:06] Enraig: TBC*
[1:20:08] Kyuubii20: Kyuubii20 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:20:08] Patadot: QoL didn't destroy retal
[1:20:09] MrGattz: yeah retail is fine. its just lack of actual rewarding content
[1:20:09] Red_Dead_Redeem: Retail destroyed itself LUL
[1:20:09] cabalish: @Towelliee TBC C Addons: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A8287&filter-sort=2    -    https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/cat161.html
[1:20:10] PvtHudson093: Any vaults this week?
[1:20:10] asteos: yeah retail is good lol
[1:20:11] cordawg: Rofl
[1:20:11] Patadot: LMFAO
[1:20:16] Fugazi811: classic andy
[1:20:17] gwar234: lfg made the game playable
[1:20:18] skaya86: I dont play a game = game is dead/destroyed
[1:20:21] littlehelle: blizzard destroyed retail
[1:20:24] Mosoner: Wish they did achievements from Classic in a way, more of a carrot for people one would think
[1:20:29] tehrobtar: agreed, @MrGattz
[1:20:34] MisterPooky: will mail and bank transfer over? ik gold does
[1:20:34] asteos: its better then bfa imo
[1:20:40] CritcobainTV: HeyGuys
[1:20:40] dooks98: I feel like lfg destroys server community tho
[1:20:41] mavericks312: here comes the retail is dead candies
[1:20:43] Mr_Cold_Ice_Tea: @cordawg no it got destroyed cause of the loot scarcity. Doing 10 or more M+ for no loot is what demotivated a lot of ppl
[1:20:44] deltadracona: im here in classic, purely to play till wrath lol,
[1:20:48] Stonefather: LFG is great, I know longer have to pay insane amounts of gold to dungeon boost because no one is doing dungeons normally Keepo
[1:20:49] Citrosis: how do u plan to lvl 1-60 paly?
[1:20:50] deltadracona: DK for the win
[1:20:52] Gingerprimer: AOE looting killed the retail lul
[1:20:52] NanotronRofl: It lacks a proper mage tower 2.0
[1:20:52] GussyMarie: good morning wow friends !!
[1:20:53] Ehtiel: can't wait til WOD Classic Kreygasm
[1:20:54] miamihassyrup: Can you teach me the ways of the towel sir?
[1:20:55] Stonefather: I no *** danS
[1:20:58] broopyd: D:
[1:21:02] Malkyr: Retail is still better then classic, just need to get away from the Artifact Power playstyle weve had since Legion with too much filler content
[1:21:04] akrus_warr: retail hater andies have woke up i see
[1:21:05] Reklusion: !tbc
[1:21:05] Moobot: @Reklusion Prepatch is in EXACTLY 8h 48m || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || TBC launch is on June 1st
[1:21:08] Shamwise: Culling inc
[1:21:11] Pathwriter: Soon on my Classic server, I will be in Ironforge by myself I think.
[1:21:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: go full arthas on the alt roster
[1:21:11] Mygdrayl: @Ehtiel LUL
[1:21:12] Hazno: auto-looting without shift-click wasn't a thing until TBC, but they implemented it in Classic, so AoE looting could be a nice QoL change for TBC :D
[1:21:20] Kize_Gaming: My biggest problems with retail is systems on top of systems, and borrowed power. Other than that it's good.
[1:21:24] MrGattz: @Towelliee im waiting for blizzard to release that deluxe edition so i can buy that for the gametime then tomorrow morning we do the purge
[1:21:25] broopyd: @Malkyr 2 completely different games, imposible to say one is better then the other.
[1:21:28] Red_Dead_Redeem: LFG and LFR made life so much easier but sure you lost sense of community in a way, but for me I enjoy that aspect
[1:21:29] GussyMarie: Today! is a GLORIOUS DAY!!!!!
[1:21:41] DreamWebb: whats the limit when it comes to "some changes" what if Blizzard add infinite boosts in Phase 4 is everyone gonna be cool with that ?
[1:21:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:21:48] PumpkinTME: I have a hunter in the guild when I make a Pally, can I drop my hunter and bring in my Pally?
[1:21:54] zeanine: cant find anywhere when its happening, anyone who knows?
[1:21:59] deltadracona: from what i can tell, pre patch starts in an hour right?
[1:22:03] DocsMistake: what time do the servers go down for maintenance?
[1:22:03] Red_Dead_Redeem: crab after that Towelliee
[1:22:07] Thoreya: ew no
[1:22:10] Stonefather: The thing with the LFG tool was, it was becoming harder and harder to find people manually to do dungeons with.
[1:22:12] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee I have been leveling an alt in SL and damn plz bring back 3 items at the end of M+
[1:22:15] FluffehZ: XIV? rooOWO
[1:22:17] MrGattz: @Towelliee im waiting for blizzard to release that deluxe edition so i can buy that for the gametime then tomorrow morning we do the purge
[1:22:18] CritcobainTV: I can't wait for patch later today so i can boost people. Yay. It's my favorite :)
[1:22:22] Jessethoth: I honestly just preferred grinding gear, gold, honor and skill.
[1:22:22] Masqerader: People acting like their servers have "communities" I been on my server for 16 years, i can tell you, it has never had a "community" and not its just a bunch of connected servers
[1:22:24] Korupcija_: do cooldowns reset on boss wipe in TBC?
[1:22:30] trivwik: no
[1:22:31] MetallicusGaming: uWu
[1:22:31] Bratvaderr: Is Demon Forged Breastplate used in level 70 when boosting/solo dungs as prot paladin?
[1:22:32] kharnij83: @towelliee was the cabinet and shelving custom made?
[1:22:32] Hazno: @DreamWebb getting store bought lvl 58 boosts in phase 4 would be welcome imo, the more people at max level the better and healthier for group play
[1:22:36] Thoreya: god make it stop
[1:22:36] Masqerader: *now
[1:22:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: lalafail
[1:22:36] philipd9889: AYAYA

[1:22:49] DanceAtTheMoonlight: LA HEE
[1:22:51] Alepouditsa: i weas thinking of trying but i hear it is not that good
[1:22:52] StoicTaurus: FF14 is at their 3rd expansion ... WoW didn't have systems untill 7th (6th if you count in Garrison)
[1:22:53] Sonatta: i really miss the world map being covered in World Quests like Legion and BFA... it gave me something to do.. Shadowlands WQ don't feel the same
[1:22:53] Pathwriter: Ya'll optimistic. They still saying servers up 3PM PST. I wouldn't be guessing hours before that yet.
[1:22:56] DocsMistake: @Towelliee please dont play a lalafell, that would just be wrong lol
[1:22:58] nonstopdisco: hey towel!

[1:23:32] Jokervenom1978: Towelliee now has lots furniture of rich mahogany.
[1:23:35] Red_Dead_Redeem: you will NEVER move then EVER!!

[1:23:57] Masqerader: gonna go full Stalin, the great purge
[1:24:08] DelcoAF: @Towelliee your next guild should be fossil nuovo gang
[1:24:09] ch1rpz: Someone’s bragging
[1:24:21] StoicTaurus: WoW needs systems so each expansion plays differently than previous one ..
[1:24:26] jerexify: @Towelliee Were you able to get enough gold saved up for boosting your Paladin, or are you going to be leveling by quests and whatnot?
[1:24:32] FolkWardz: Am I thinking koko waiting to deliver quests until the patch is up? for ekstra xp, I am 32 atm
[1:24:39] falldrgn: Towliee doesn't lie.. He is  a saint!
[1:24:41] MrGattz: wow $5? thats a deal and a half
[1:24:50] Sarocus: Bragging is allowed, though
[1:24:51] Masqerader: let's all thank Doge for that glorious shelf
[1:24:54] sindrellaman7: is one not allowed to be proud of his shit?
[1:24:55] truxcat: 60-70 is like 2k ish
[1:24:55] raizanava: I'm ready to try TBC it will be my first step in classic
[1:25:02] Stonefather: 4300 gold that's just enough to boost from 1-60 Keepo
[1:25:05] Red_Dead_Redeem: 5 dollars for what, the light bulb LUL
[1:25:16] AnubiS1690: EHY THE FUCKKKK DID I WORK OVERTIME TODAY 😭😭
[1:25:22] DelcoAF: you should sell T-shirts that say "Do you even Fossil Nuovo bro?
[1:25:26] Pathwriter: You could just say "Chat trade me gold" and have 50k in 10 minutes.
[1:25:28] Stonefather: I remember doing quests in Nagrand during BC I got like 300-400g from all of them.
[1:25:37] aliceuwu_x: im going Into BC with 200g :(
[1:25:58] Red_Dead_Redeem: I'm going into BC with 5k gold :)
[1:26:00] DreamWebb: are there any opening the gate type of events in TBC
[1:26:00] Zarbos: should I pack all my gold and mats on the char before tranfer it to TBC?
[1:26:00] GussyMarie: lol im going into bc with 4.45 g lol
[1:26:05] AnubiS1690: Y’all need to chill, I’m going into BC at level 29 with 8g

[1:26:16] ArcaneSyntax: im going into bc with 30 gold lmao
[1:26:17] DocsMistake: hmm do I start a paladin today or boost a druid and get that to 60
[1:26:17] falldrgn: getting 5K and epic flying was a big deal
[1:26:20] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: how much gold do we think the boost comes with? "a little bit of gold to start your journey"
[1:26:21] Kinghorn: 5k is epic flying 1k for normal
[1:26:27] Jessethoth: I played on Fenris-Alliance....
[1:26:28] Kinghorn: and cost for mounts
[1:26:31] Swiftytrigger: im starting brok
[1:26:34] Jessethoth: It was such dogshit...
[1:26:35] legobind: you can make the gold for flying in the 1st week if you have a good server
[1:26:42] Red_Dead_Redeem: unless you get free flying druids just camping around LUL
[1:26:43] Mosoner: So much gold from the broken Classic economy everyone will be flying around
[1:26:44] essentialoils141: how fast is flying in tbc
[1:26:47] Mygdrayl: The 50g from boost is enough? Kappa
[1:26:48] RumPULL4Skinnz: I didn't get flying for quite a while after 70 and couldn't afford epic flying until WOTLK
[1:26:49] northern__soul: I wont be getting my mount quick
[1:26:50] legobind: you can make it with just selling cloth
[1:26:52] Moskeebee: whos ready to get to max lv then quit..i am , just like 1st time around bubbaarmyRestingtudface

[1:26:58] Masqerader: farm motes of fire and you will be rich in no time in shadowmoon to make primal fires you will be epic flying in no time
[1:27:06] Stonefather: Hopefully they'll have a database error and everyone can only transfer 100g in Keepo
[1:27:06] crrdsh: room looks good @Towelliee
[1:27:13] Dartbro: confident KEKW
[1:27:16] Jessethoth: Fresh servers would be further from recreating the history, which is only important to a point but that's one point I'd rather stay the same.
[1:27:24] trivwik: yeah, they lying like a bad rug
[1:27:33] Shugaze: there might be new servers in EU cus they have only 1 PVE server and it might be a mess
[1:27:33] ninousT: i need to know the level of confidence they have on a 1-10 scale
[1:27:34] mavericks312: let the good old primal farming begin
[1:27:39] truxcat: the judgement server will be fine tho 100%
[1:27:40] trivwik: -1
[1:27:44] raizanava: do you think its going to take nolifing to get a belf fron1-60 before expac?
[1:27:48] Shugaze: EU French*
[1:27:50] ArcaneSyntax: honestly if i had to level again to play TBC i wouldnt even bother lmao
[1:27:50] qualybased: to be fair didnty they do that with classic launch tho?
[1:27:50] Attackroot: fresh servers and thye forget to open aq and people get the mount again... lol
[1:27:56] xhaven: I have to find a guild still for TBC however
[1:27:57] Jessethoth: That's a card they have up their sleeve for later.
[1:28:00] its_Orphic: What are people doing during prepatch to prepare?
[1:28:02] ZenjiBro: bring on Fresh servers! I welcome it
[1:28:04] stresstest: would be great if they had fresh servers for TBC launch
[1:28:09] northern__soul: Me too
[1:28:11] qualybased: good point
[1:28:12] Mosoner: @qualybased yes but every server was fresh to death
[1:28:15] deathly1717: deathly1717 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:28:17] Stonefather: @Attackroot That's actually how it was back in the day IIRC it wasn't until Cata they made the gates already open when they made a new server.
[1:28:22] cabalish: did u try silithus for ooze covered rich thorium vein ?
[1:28:25] DreamWebb: theyre gonna stop people playing because of their word press x to doubt LUL
[1:28:28] Masqerader: I mean a 12 hour queue was a sign they needed new servers for classic lol
[1:28:29] Jessethoth: If WoW picked up huge popularity suddenly in the next few years, you can bet your ass they'd do fresh starts on previous Classics though.
[1:28:41] DelcoAF: @Towelliee you should get a sponsorship form Fossil called the "Nuovo" line...
[1:28:42] radiorahem: yike ive been mia for nearly half a year so bc coming out soon?
[1:28:44] Shugaze: The French EU servers only has 1 PVE and its FULL, they might get a FRESH tbc with transfers
[1:28:49] Jessethoth: I'd love to see them do seasonal themes and shit.
[1:28:52] Jessethoth: Yeah not now for sure.
[1:28:54] its_Orphic: What are people doing during prepatch to prepare?
[1:28:58] Flyingboots: @radiorahem June 1st
[1:29:00] Mosoner: When they hype from wrath Classic dies down a bit you will see Classic wow fresh servers open
[1:29:06] Shearkahn: Do you think they should merge some servers?
[1:29:09] DreamWebb: if theres classic launch esque queues theyll add them
[1:29:12] Girm87: just more layers
[1:29:14] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: !tbc
[1:29:14] Moobot: @PuffyTheMagicalDragon Prepatch is in EXACTLY 8h 39m 52s || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[1:29:20] radiorahem: @Flyingboots yikes of course its on the day that i move
[1:29:21] Jessethoth: They'd split that server first, they'd offer free xfers and split them.
[1:29:22] Ytsejam: Will the pre-patch appear in the launcher for all?
[1:29:23] quju_: wrath hype dying? lol
[1:29:24] Stonefather: I'd love fresh servers for TBC but I doubt it'll happen.
[1:29:37] Flyingboots: @radiorahem Oof, at least you could test out the prepatch that comes out today for US and tomorrow for EU
[1:29:49] Jessethoth: I mean they can hotfix a shard practically at this point. LOL
[1:29:56] RumPULL4Skinnz: I'd love fresh start servers after WOTLK is finished so we can do classic all the way through to the end of wrath again in a few years time. I can't see anyone wanting any past wrath

[1:30:03] Masqerader: cross realm zones
[1:30:05] falldrgn: I remeber when Phasing was put in and it jacked with Worth PVP
[1:30:08] Ulfinator: Whats the Point of a Fresh Server if you can  Transfer to it? LUL
[1:30:09] Girm87: was the layers for WoD, iirc they had to buy loads of extra kid to host the layers
[1:30:09] its_Orphic: What are people doing during prepatch to prepare?
[1:30:11] Rocczi: They will have to make it for some servers for EU, example Gehennas, Mograine they are to populated atm

[1:30:26] R2RHIN0: Same, I got stuck in my garrison for like 24 hours
[1:30:34] CajunCrusader: CajunCrusader subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 67 months! 
[1:30:41] Flyingboots: I played Monk in Draenor launch, got stuck in a lagspike mid roll and rolled from Horde starting zone to shattrath through zangarmarsh
[1:30:44] 770Cash: Makrik gonna be crazy
[1:30:47] SonofHorus82: Did Area 52 ever come up for Shadowlands? LUL
[1:30:48] skaya86: The launcher says pre-patch is tomorrow, is there different days for US/EU?
[1:30:49] pannkakewow: how long until the prepatch hits?
[1:30:55] qualybased: One thing I haven't seen talked about anywhere was if theyre going to allow boosts on that new Krol Blade server

[1:31:42] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[1:31:59] DreamWebb: are all toons default migrating to TBC or do we have to specify the move on each one
[1:31:59] Mosoner: BfA was the worst launch for me. Horde side couldn’t loot that death potion before you go off to SW for the mission. Then Illidan was down for days after that

[1:33:12] Mosoner: Yes farm those BG tokens
[1:33:14] RumPULL4Skinnz: Yeah but I think a lot of people will be saving marks and honour for buying 70 pvp gear
[1:33:22] chubby_ch4ser: background looks sick!
[1:33:24] miamihassyrup: it costs about 60k honor the marks are harder than the honor to farm
[1:33:32] miamihassyrup: 50
[1:33:32] bmili1: 40 av marks for 2h
[1:33:33] CritcobainTV: for 1hs it's 20 AB tokens for me and 15.3k honor
[1:33:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: 40 for a 2h 20 for 1h

[1:35:51] PvtHudson093: thinking of boosting a human paladin to play some tbcc holy paladin
[1:35:53] Stonefather: @pulkjavel Pretty sure it was 12 slots but could be 14s
[1:35:54] Jermo11: @pulkjavel i think it was runecloth
[1:35:55] Rocczi: Gehennas was 25hours at classic launch
[1:36:00] tenassity69: folks gonna go back to using remote desktop to play a 15 year old game. thats tough
[1:36:02] irlock143: @Towelliee  are they leaving the level cap at 60?
[1:36:05] Mosoner: Runecloth bags I think
[1:36:18] GRETZKY99: right its a combo of bg token and honor for each gear slot
[1:36:20] deltadracona: we will stay at 60 till june
[1:36:23] Unciatim: Sad thing is when servers "scheduled" to come back up.... US will be getting home or already home from work/school....

[1:37:18] Holysal: @modaaa4 yes the are
[1:37:20] Stonefather: I'm shocked they didn't add race change faction change and a unlimited boost danKEK
[1:37:25] Kinghorn: 4-5 is the low end

[1:43:09] Jessethoth: i loved my unhitability macro that I apparently wasn't supposed to have.
[1:43:11] Hazno: @Towelliee bottoms up! (channel point redemption)
[1:43:30] orgasmatron8: how long does it take to solo paly and beat bosses solo ?
[1:43:34] dalaraz: feral is fairly easy to gear up at start and pretty strong,only downside is threat on more than 1 target
[1:43:38] PvtHudson093: gemming defence
[1:43:38] dayzzeven: Warriors start very strong but end up being the worst tank
[1:43:41] Holymoomo: are bear tanks better at BC ?
[1:43:42] shadowmoonsmile: Background looks awesome

[1:44:12] dalaraz: bears are the best single target tanks overall
[1:44:15] thrakan84: ohh my Gunnar glasses showed up yesterday
[1:44:21] Holymoomo: cause seeing 1.5 tank class is kinda depressing LUL
[1:44:25] RetiredNavyVet: @StealScars the good ones were the best X)
[1:44:29] RiptoreCA: any solid idea when servers come back up anyone?
[1:44:31] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee did you see the "new" speedrun strat for naxx? They were going from thaddius to sapphiron with the buff and killing sapphiron in literally 30 seconds LUL
[1:44:34] Hazno: would love to see your background lights dynamically match the class you're currently playing @Towelliee
[1:44:35] rhodeos_: paladins/bears are gods in 5 man tho
[1:44:35] IndistusX: How was ret in BC?
[1:44:36] Haximaxi: If your locks want to seed you will need them
[1:44:36] Attackroot: at tbc my druid started as heals, but by SSC they had me go tank and stay tank.
[1:44:38] Ohdies: that green lighting on that shelf is pretty sick
[1:44:41] Stars_Eternall: @RetiredNavyVet SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:44:42] Hazno: @RiptoreCA check their ETA in the launcher
[1:44:44] dalaraz: @RiptoreCA up to 8 hours as said in meintenance
[1:44:46] katkis88: @Towelliee pala taunt works as normal taunt now, its in PTR
[1:44:52] Kinghorn: it is better if they have more than 1 mob on them LUL
[1:44:58] RiptoreCA: not near a computer lol
[1:44:59] Xenrawr: @Towelliee you can macro it with a @targettarget modifier
[1:45:00] katkis88: beta*
[1:45:01] Wulfgrym: @critcobain hows it going
[1:45:03] EmbraceNext: You make the macro target of target for the pally taunt
[1:45:06] CritcobainTV: Yoo what's up wulf
[1:45:12] Bratvaderr: Yes
[1:45:14] Haximaxi: if you macro it
[1:45:14] LethalGamess: anyone else here getting last minute mount runs in before shit down?
[1:45:20] katkis88: @Towelliee 100% its in Beta right now
[1:45:20] LethalGamess: shutdown*
[1:45:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: you need a macro to make it work like a normal taunt
[1:45:22] Bratvaderr: No need for macro either.
[1:45:23] aleagues: realistically boys..what time these servers popping back online today?
[1:45:23] PokerFaceMoose: you are supposed to target a teammate not the badguy
[1:45:24] KinggKebab: With pre-patch coming out today, when do you think we should expect an announcement for 9.1 release?
[1:45:26] PokerFaceMoose: unless macrod
[1:45:28] Girm87: dont think it does, thought it was friendly target thing
[1:45:28] gingerbasterd: I think they changed it
[1:45:32] katkis88: @Towelliee without macroin yes
[1:45:33] CosyWoW: It is like you say
[1:45:35] EmbraceNext: It is not a normal taunt in BC
[1:45:37] CosyWoW: the dude is trolling
[1:45:41] hammack52: @Towelliee blizz baked int he macro that everyone uses so you can use it like a normal taunt
[1:45:41] Hazno: @aleagues realistically, no one knows
[1:45:41] TwoBlueCrabs: yeah but it's just a regular taunt with macro
[1:45:44] Wulfgrym: @critcobain not sure if i am coming back to wow or not, been busy working on my business stuff but checking out prepatch
[1:45:47] Bratvaderr: Its a normal taunt now, yes.
[1:45:59] CritcobainTV: @Wulfgrym damn man. well if u dont come back, send me your gold ;)
[1:46:00] katkis88: they changed it
[1:46:12] infinitrus: its better it taunts 3
[1:46:16] Wulfgrym: @critcobain lol i don't even have the game installed right now or subbed
[1:46:17] Jessethoth: You can macro it to function that way.
[1:46:20] dimofodi: what's tooltip read?
[1:46:21] Jessethoth: I think is what he means.
[1:46:21] TwoBlueCrabs: it's better since it's ranged and taunts 3
[1:46:22] CritcobainTV: @Wulfgrym RIP
[1:46:23] Kinghorn: that is beta not ptr
[1:46:25] KrakonSkullz: Will Prot pallys have Redoubt?
[1:46:36] Skylin3r: should have sent me the files
[1:46:41] Jessethoth: Like you could theoretically tell it to target that target's target with a macro right? That might be what he means.
[1:46:46] tthorthetank: We get the hotfixed version where you dont have to use the macro from 2.4
[1:46:50] Unciatim: copy interface and wtf folders?
[1:46:51] ContraRob: Does the 1-60 leveling get a little shorter with pre=patch? I can't remember if they scaled XP after BC
[1:46:51] Skylin3r: i see
[1:46:56] Jessethoth: But Towelliee is right as well, you're still not DIRECTLY taunting that mob.

[1:47:31] CritcobainTV: @Wulfgrym it's all good bro, we'll be here for when u can come back <3
[1:47:40] EmbraceNext: The only thing i didn't like as tanking in BC is having to stack spell damage for agro.
[1:47:51] ContraRob: Awesome, so waiting to level means I could get some gains
[1:47:52] DHedbor: Righteous Defense: "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Patch 2.4.0 (25-Mar-2008): Can also be cast on enemy mob."
[1:47:57] sperg0verlord: are we going to be able to use your 58 boost today ?
[1:48:13] Wulfgrym: @critcobain got into day trading and making over 10k a month now but I trade like 15 hours a day
[1:48:17] Squirrel_nutty: once servers go live yes
[1:48:26] Kelwinnz: would you prefer regular taunt ?
[1:48:32] sperg0verlord: are we going to be able to use our 58 boost today ?
[1:48:35] LethalGamess: you gotta use it on a friendly player
[1:48:36] Skylin3r: i'll mess with it when the servers come back up
[1:48:45] katkis88: some1 needs to have agro on it, and u can cast RD without any macros on it
[1:48:48] Xenrawr: why would you need to though
[1:48:55] biirrd: What does the Tooltip does?
[1:48:58] Daggerstry: He already has a BE paladin?
[1:48:59] LethalGamess: same. idk whos trying to say otherwise
[1:49:02] katkis88: ...
[1:49:04] PuliGT: I believe if it is attacking someone else you can just taunt the mob
[1:49:12] PuliGT: that was a change they made
[1:49:12] Hazno: @Daggerstry that was the beta client
[1:49:12] Dartbro: :tf:
[1:49:14] Kelwinnz: lol
[1:49:16] DHedbor: According to the change log though, in 2.4 it can be used on enemy targets
[1:49:16] Wulfgrym: taunt troll alert

[1:49:24] CipansR_Ayaya: good one chat
[1:49:25] neiljo: i think they're saying you dont have to cast it on a player you can just cast it on the mob but the mob still has to be attacking a player
[1:49:28] DocsMistake: @Towelliee you planning to get down on more of The Show during maintenance?
[1:49:34] hammack52: @Towelliee all blizz did was bake the macro that everyone uses into the spell, to make it easier to use
[1:49:40] SonofHorus82: Imagine telling the original belf prot paladin how to play prot paladin LUL LUL
[1:49:42] Xenrawr: @Towelliee you can macro it so when you target the mob it taunts
[1:49:42] Skylin3r: so.. if you're solo, and want to taunt pull' you taunt yourself? Kappa
[1:49:43] Frozen_DK: targettarget makro working in BC ?
[1:49:47] trivwik: #sometrolls
[1:49:49] etter00: the knife hand is coming out
[1:49:49] katkis88: i have a link for a YT vid for it
[1:49:51] Bratvaderr: But there is a video, they've changed it
[1:49:54] t_apta_p: YellowFever but acstuually when I read the patch logs... it says you can use it on mobs *adjust glasses*
[1:49:56] katkis88: if u wanna permit me to link it...
[1:49:56] dalaraz: you can target of target macro and you dont need to switch off of the enemy or mousover anything @Towelliee
[1:49:59] thrakan84: It isn't going to feel like an authentic experience if the servers don't die multiply times
[1:50:08] CritcobainTV: Towelliee did you know that prot paladins now have divine toll in TBC to make sure they don't lose threat anymore? POGGERS
[1:50:10] Spykex02: Towellie what seal do I use now when tanking? Is it sor or would I use blood or vengeance now?
[1:50:14] banishtyrion: nw lol
[1:50:15] Mosoner: @towelliee no now you can just have the mob targeted without needing that macro, threat still needs to be on another player, yes.
[1:50:15] KinggKebab: Any predicitions on when we'll get an announcement for 9.1 release?
[1:50:16] Jessethoth: New World is a bag of shit waiting to be lit on fire.
[1:50:17] dimofodi: The way it works taunting up to 3 targets pretty much requires it to target a friendly instead of a hostile.
[1:50:26] khrownoes: today WOW is the SHOW
[1:50:33] motorboatingpro: I think this is what I used back in the day:      /cast [@targettarget] Righteous Defense
[1:50:36] xhaven: when is maintenance for prepatch supposed to start?
[1:50:38] 91Niki: Wait, i heard they deleted paladins ? Kappa
[1:50:39] slizard93: BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY
[1:50:42] Jessethoth: Of course, that's what a good tank does man. :D
[1:50:43] Mosoner: Just takes the need for macro out that’s all
[1:50:44] Carnasis: @Towelliee Great to see you man, looking healthy, wish you the very best in TBC!
[1:50:50] EmbraceNext: yes
[1:50:52] Korupcija_: before July PogChamp
[1:50:55] Oriqqs: twice I think
[1:50:55] Osskssa: yes
[1:50:55] manmower: i think you said july/aug originally
[1:51:00] LethalGamess: didnt shamans have athreat generator in tbc? seen one tank way backi n the day, wasnt great tho lol

[1:51:26] Sicktrixan: Yo it’s the tank god!
[1:51:31] eatonaround: @Undeash yes
[1:51:32] jerexify: @Undeash Yep.
[1:51:32] Tecni: @Undeash yes
[1:51:33] Hazno: @LethalGamess Shamans could keep aggro with rockbiter weapons in classic, but bonus threat got removed in tbc
[1:51:35] iunbearable: inside trading, never can be wrong towLul
[1:51:52] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee The macro is basically just to use it on your targets current target so u dont have to use a mouse over, i'll find it for u
[1:51:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:51:56] Osskssa: how long until prepatch for you @Towelliee
[1:51:57] xhaven: its a 1.24 min video very short
[1:51:58] Templexx: you chillin online all day?
[1:52:02] goatjohnson: We can we buy the BC bundles?
[1:52:04] lancer32: those 20 min videos to cover 2 min of info are annoying as hell
[1:52:06] Undeash: hmm maybe ill start playing classic and lvl up a blood elf pala
[1:52:10] Furinax: when is the patch going love for US?
[1:52:14] Furinax: Live*
[1:52:15] PokerFaceMoose: @LethalGamess earth shock was a ton of threat. match that with rockbiter and shield and some talents, they do fine
[1:52:16] uhtred_gaming: vayon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:52:18] CritcobainTV: go back further

[1:52:29] livewithcouch: Towlie? you looking for the pally taunt?
[1:52:37] katkis88: point of the video is, you dont need macro, he uses it without it too
[1:52:38] Jessethoth: That's what I was saying.
[1:52:46] Jessethoth: Which ends up pinging off the boomer. :D
[1:52:46] rhodeos_: thats a 5 head taunt
[1:52:50] woohdakidd: morning boss man
[1:52:51] Hazno: imagine typing in the spell name after #showtooltip for a single spell macro KEKW
[1:52:55] CritcobainTV: yeah its the same thing, doesn't change too much in the grand scheme of things
[1:52:57] Jessethoth: I thought that's what the guy was saying but I wasn't sure, memory is foggy AF.
[1:53:01] BlackBird252L: 15min
[1:53:02] hellofreaky: you on faerlina?
[1:53:03] DHedbor: The point is in TBC 2.4 that "targettarget" functionality was baked into the ability so you don't need the macro
[1:53:20] Vekks_GW2: i prefer a mouseover for RD to just slap it over a raid frame that has aggro that shouldn't
[1:53:21] dimofodi: It's a macro to click a hostile and taunt, has to be since it taunts up to 3 off of a friendly otherwise they'd have to code it to determine the hostiles target and then other things targetting it. Too much work.
[1:53:25] woohdakidd: what server?
[1:53:26] Jessethoth: Yeah that happened too @DHedbor
[1:53:27] DocsMistake: yea because the great purge is happening today lol

[1:53:44] CipansR_Ayaya: LUL
[1:53:45] Jessethoth: OHHHH I SEE NOW, he's saying you might not NEED the macro since it's based on 2.4?
[1:53:49] Jessethoth: I think that's what he means.
[1:53:50] hammack52: @Towelliee that macro is not needed, i have been on the beta, they baked it in baseline, the only one that you might think about is a mouse over one so you dont have to stop targeting the one you are currently targeting
[1:53:53] Hazno: @Jessethoth yes
[1:53:55] mr3machine: Stop being smart
[1:53:55] hellofreaky: thats why i went on faerlina to kill asmon LUL
[1:53:58] belfastcl: staysafe switched to a pve server
[1:53:59] DHedbor: @Jessethoth correct
[1:53:59] katkis88: thats what iv been saying..

[1:54:08] truxcat: wPvP isnt that big in tbc either so why be on one LUL
[1:54:08] poonywow: @hellofreaky sad
[1:54:09] Jessethoth: Right so they just changed it in 2.4, that's cool.
[1:54:20] Bratvaderr: @Jessethoth Yes if you just watch the clip he taunts without a Macro, as we've said. Its a regular taunt now
[1:54:28] Skylin3r: or turn off war mode
[1:54:32] teqnikirl: my mans mining all he can till Pre-patch
[1:54:33] DHedbor: a @mouseover macro can still be useful though, but as of 2.4 it works both on enemy and friendly targets
[1:54:34] hellofreaky: i made a character named baldmofo to kill asmon
[1:54:36] radiorahem: nearly been 2  years since that decision?
[1:54:40] Jessethoth: That's fine, if people were using a macro to do it anyway, I don't consider that a hard change.
[1:54:41] BlackBird252L: 13min now
[1:54:43] khrownoes: just got it
[1:54:46] magemaster225: retail timer is up 13:00 left

[1:54:55] paddingwow: how long timer down?
[1:54:57] DHedbor: @Jessethoth O'
[1:54:58] Hazno: @hellofreaky that's kinda sad tbh LUL

[1:55:01] CritcobainTV: i have 18 marks in my mailbox for prepatch Pog
[1:55:05] CritcobainTV: just need 2 more
[1:55:07] DHedbor: I'm guessing they changed it because everyone used macro for it
[1:55:13] Sicktrixan: Yo what’s your leveling strat come blood elf launch
[1:55:20] Mosoner: A character made and spent time on just to kill Asmon? Lol time to re-evaluate life decisions

[1:55:53] jackjonesiii: blood elves are so hot
[1:55:53] fistofnature: is this a global release pre patch or regional?
[1:56:01] PuliGT: could be longer
[1:56:04] Stopmirin: What is there to do in the pre patch?
[1:56:06] thrakan84: I can only imagine that it should be easier this time around to apply the prepatch
[1:56:07] Hazno: @fistofnature regional
[1:56:07] fridostv: its not global
[1:56:10] Zapotek_S: who knows, blizz does

[2:10:19] rhodeos_: just wait until you run into a bear in world PVP and you cant deal damage to it
[2:10:20] SonofHorus82: Honestly, that 5 minutes was the most fun I've had in classic in MONTHS.
[2:10:22] bren92: @dalaraz all the videos I watched said no proff with boost
[2:10:23] Doedje: Yeah no professions and very shitty gear
[2:10:29] Doedje: Basicly naked

[2:11:29] Ambersulfr: sometimes I think about making an EU character then I remember the latency is awful.
[2:11:29] Hazno: @falldrgn if you already have a character on classic, just choose to continue into TBC when you log on after pre-patch drops and it will be a TBC Classic character, no need to level another one unless you want to keep your existing character in Classic and not pay for a clone
[2:11:39] chowzter: Bm hunters become bonkers

[2:12:48] Khlaro: @Towelliee So, I'm hearing that the exp to level is lower in TBC then it is in Classic, is that a thing?
[2:12:49] othraerir: naxx carries to 70
[2:12:51] PsychoWarren: 69
[2:12:52] shogon: 67 or so
[2:12:56] ZenjiBro: some of it lasts until Kara
[2:12:59] kusse_john: @slowsuby alright thx
[2:13:00] BoRoDoR: ye 5000
[2:13:00] jasonx282: 70
[2:13:05] khrownoes: MOM is replaced at 70
[2:13:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: im gonna get my paladin into the last naxx raid and try to get as much gear as possible lol
[2:13:06] tbbex_: so... what now? I have nothing to plY
[2:13:09] tbbex_: play*
[2:13:09] odpw23: Naxx gear is insane compared to anything else for a while
[2:13:09] all_beef_franks: even just my warrior in some t2 and t2.5 items, smased hellfire mobs in a hit or 2
[2:13:11] Wolfegang16: Some trinks/weaps until kara
[2:13:13] Brodih_: but getting upgrades is part of the fun of leveling personally
[2:13:14] LethalGamess: im gonna main tank with shaman
[2:13:15] Alepouditsa: @SonofHorus82 you can boost shamans?
[2:13:16] Hazno: @gamingwithsat either because they want to clear Classic content while it's still relevant, or because they want better gear to level faster, or just because they find it fun
[2:13:16] TommySeeker: @Khlaro_ I heard it's like 30% less xp to 60
[2:13:17] Redhed_Iou: where's the fun in that? I love feeling stronger with each level and each piece of gear
[2:13:21] Doedje: There are some ridiculous stat converges which make certain vanilla items way too strong still in tbc
[2:13:22] pixxelina: atiesh defo until kara
[2:13:23] feninr: naxx gear lasts till ulduar dosent it? @Towelliee
[2:13:24] Vexxsis: im in all bwl gear so w.e lol
[2:13:26] Motivess: @towelliee can we see some NBA while we wait? XD
[2:13:27] rhodeos_: you cannot boost alliance shamans or horde paladins
[2:13:30] banishtyrion: aren't some Vanilla trinkets kinda OP for TBC too ?
[2:13:31] SyrothTV: t2 should carry until like 67ish or maybe heroics
[2:13:34] UHREG: rip warriors
[2:13:45] gamingwithsat: you dungeon rep grinding or just going to quest?
[2:13:45] banishtyrion: that hit rating trink from BWL ?
[2:14:00] NovaSun84: My BM hunter will be dungeon crawling for the rep grinds.  Will be happy to sling arrows :)

[2:14:00] all_beef_franks: @UHREG warriors still good, just not massively better than the rest
[2:14:04] othraerir: there isn't mob sharing is there?
[2:14:05] rhodeos_: when TBC first launched i just hit 60 a few days before... literally 7 min per demon pig kill
[2:14:06] luckfore: why rush to 70, just enjoy
[2:14:07] DHedbor: that boosted gear is amazingly terrible
[2:14:10] paddingwow: @SyrothTV it sooo depends on your class, specc and items tbh like t3 is replaced with a lot of pre raid bis
[2:14:11] Vexxsis: In all honestly just pvp in pre patch , that gear will last a bit
[2:14:12] coldhandsbeatz: They should give boosted characters blue gear tbh
[2:14:15] 10th_d0ct0r: @Towelliee Just read a wowhead guide if you need assistance for speed lvling. TLDR: Just buy boost after lvl 10 LUL
[2:14:17] TommySeeker: Is the boosted gear worst than MC gear?
[2:14:17] Khlaro: @Charlot6 Yeah, that's about what I heard. The one thing I really liked about classic was the fact that exp leveling took a long time, but w/e. I'll just enjoy it either way
[2:14:26] gravelzz: Find a hunter to do mob tagg take you like 1 hr from 1 to 15
[2:14:27] Biorrwolf: Do you have a link to a good Prot Build?
[2:14:28] DexdPhxrxoh: DexdPhxrxoh subscribed with Prime. 
[2:14:30] SyrothTV: @paddingwow  yea thats why i said maybe heroics lol
[2:14:35] Hazno: @Charlot6 yes, you will be boosted to 58 with lvl 58 greens
[2:14:35] woohdakidd: tbc classic was super fun to quest
[2:14:39] shogon: lvl 50 greens with no str on pally on beta in TBC i killed the mobs with tears  @Towelliee
[2:14:47] paddingwow: monkaS majority of my pre raid bis si like normal dungeon
[2:14:47] Mr_Arms: yeah 60-70 is fast tbh at least for me
[2:14:48] Coox69: they should just put 'Deluxe Boost' into the shop for 60 dollar and you get better gear Kapp
[2:14:49] Tighron: i know im going to be taking my time with it
[2:14:54] OneNetGaming: Does spell power effect blizzard in by
[2:14:58] OneNetGaming: Bc
[2:15:01] Exodeo_: I'm only 38 Kappa
[2:15:02] korver_: you're 100% a masochist if you think the word to describe questing in classic wow is "fun" lol
[2:15:04] FranticAlba: Classic maintenance 8 hours apparently Sadge
[2:15:05] Hellizzy: Best questing is 70-80
[2:15:18] sinlesssinner: it ll take 7 days max, taking it easy af too
[2:15:21] Vexxsis: ill be 70 with in 4-5
[2:15:23] Doedje: @Tw0Sh0t yes, but just like in vanilla its not rlly worth it and there's an aoe damage cap
[2:15:27] 10th_d0ct0r: Who will be farming Ogrila rep? Kappa
[2:15:27] woohdakidd: itll take me 2weeks because of my work life  and five kids lmao
[2:15:32] korver_: i hope yall are talking about 60-70!
[2:15:36] Triist0ne: servers down?
[2:15:39] Mr_Arms: yeah no shot it took me two weeks to hit 60 at classic launch
[2:15:40] korver_: no way 1-70 will take a week
[2:15:44] gamingwithsat: 7 days of played or in general?
[2:15:48] feninr: people will be 70 by wed afternoon
[2:15:52] TrevorAP: Waiting for TBC, watching Towelliee, todays gonna be a good day.
[2:15:57] Korupcija_: mr gm tweeted you can enter 30 dungeons a day
[2:15:57] OneNetGaming: @doedje thanks mana pool it is then
[2:16:00] 770Cash: Ill be trying to level as much as posible while working from home
[2:16:00] Vexxsis: TBC is all about end game more than vanilla
[2:16:05] DexdPhxrxoh: @Towelliee  the x's are a's
[2:16:05] rhodeos_: dont forget everyone, its a rush to the RING OF BLOOD quest at lvl 65 for kickass weapons in nagrand
[2:16:06] HedbergzaCKz: cant decied what to play warlock or mage help me out..
[2:16:07] dianthusnemo: 60-70  with preparation can be done i n48 hours
[2:16:10] Triist0ne: Did the servers go down ?
[2:16:10] yankerzzz: i called out of work for this shit! i hope its not down til 6 lmfao
[2:16:11] woohdakidd: ill put my kids on shifts
[2:16:11] paddingwow: @Korupcija_ Only 30 a day? they didnt increas eit
[2:16:12] ZenjiBro: 1-70 will take about 110hours of not boosted play
[2:16:12] paddingwow: fack
[2:16:18] DexdPhxrxoh: but anytime man <3
[2:16:20] Kyuubii20: when pre patch goes live is leveling easier ?
[2:16:22] QuiteBusting: @Towelliee You just gunna stream yourself waiting?
[2:16:22] FranticAlba: Only 30 lmao
[2:16:24] korver_: TBC is of course all about end game!
[2:16:24] RaNubizz: damn 30, that sucks
[2:16:24] einself111: not really confirmed
[2:16:29] luckfore: hes trying to make you confirm it LUL
[2:16:30] odpw23: Yikes
[2:16:30] slowsuby: @Kyuubii20 yes
[2:16:32] probablyrandall: only 30 for all characters on the same realm
[2:16:34] Verynicepotato: Then i can do me 15 hc + my normals Sadge
[2:16:35] korver_: the point of the game is NOT to quest, it's to endure the questing to actually enjoy the game
[2:16:39] OneNetGaming: What 30 a day..
[2:16:40] shogon: lvl 1-20 is same, 20-60 is 30% less xp, with new talents, etc 4-5 days to level isnt unhead of
[2:16:40] Vexxsis: wonder how Orc players are feeling for that racial nerf lul
[2:16:48] Tighron: wait, there is/was a daily limit on dungeons?
[2:16:49] Templexx: is that 30 normal or they trying to stop that kinda grind?
[2:16:55] iunbearable: Beta TBC still up @Towelliee
[2:16:59] Verynicepotato: can´t
[2:17:02] gamingwithsat: i think 30 is fair
[2:17:05] TrevorAP: Yall think its going to take the full 8 hours?
[2:17:17] thrakan84: anyone order Gfuel to Canada? How long did shipping take?
[2:17:18] Hazno: @TrevorAP impossible to say
[2:17:18] Tighron: 30 is a pretty large amount though
[2:17:21] da_moosse: the quests have better xp and item rewards as well as reduced xp for 20-60
[2:17:32] einself111: That does not really confirm it for me
[2:17:32] korver_: @TrevorAP i'd guess they have it ready an hour or 2 early
[2:17:34] asteos: ??
[2:17:36] FranticAlba: Oh, it's per character, that's not too bad then
[2:17:36] Doedje: Not even 1% LUL
[2:17:37] Vexxsis: lol bengay
[2:17:37] t_800_i: Kreygasm
[2:17:37] T0MMYT: IonJam
[2:17:39] Blvdman: LOOOOL
[2:17:39] TrevorAP: @Hazno I feel like they always over estimate
[2:17:40] TMMOOF: Or you drank a gfuel on a saturday lol
[2:17:40] rhodeos_: thats 6 hours worth of dungeons...thats zzz content
[2:17:41] loki2k20: this is messed up, they advertise that the prepatch comes out on the 18th and than they're not going to release it until the end of the day for the east coast
[2:17:41] Camelbak21: 30 dungeons is literally 6 hours if you do a reset every 15 minutes
[2:17:42] asteos: 30 dungeons is nothing wtf
[2:17:42] PWZangetsu: Prepatch waiting room
[2:17:43] paddingwow: you need 88 dungeons to get 60-70 in dungeons
[2:17:49] Tighron: Team No-Dayjob
[2:17:50] FranticAlba: I thought it was 30 per account, not per character
[2:17:54] all_beef_franks: it really only affected people getting boosted or boosting low dungeons
[2:17:58] Coox69: yea enjoy your 30 Slave Pen runs and the aneurism you get from doing it for 6 hours lmao
[2:18:00] korver_: 88 dungeons for 60-70? is that confirmed??
[2:18:01] realdevv: @Towelliee When we level on TBC launch in naxx gear we will clear dungeons in 10-15 minutes.
[2:18:02] UHREG: that's like 7hrs to do all 30
[2:18:04] OneNetGaming: I was planning to boost my guilds tho
[2:18:04] TrevorAP: @korver_ i hope so i would hate to log on and make a belf at prime time
[2:18:06] realdevv: Its gonna fuck our leveling.
[2:18:07] Saakki: when will pre patch start?
[2:18:09] DocsMistake: people just wanted more for boosting and farming
[2:18:09] Hazno: @TrevorAP better to overestimate than underestimate :D but it could also go longer, which has happened several times before as well, so your guess is as good as everyone else's
[2:18:10] dynkoxd: You need more than 80
[2:18:11] Sonatta: Bengay? didn't they stop making that? LUL
[2:18:11] korver_: can someone give me a rough estimate of how long 88 dungeons would take 60-70?
[2:18:18] KythosMeltdown: 30mins per dungeon 30 dungeons is 15 hrs
[2:18:19] dynkoxd: 14 + 42 + 48
[2:18:22] Templexx: in b4 sweatys get angry
[2:18:23] jontrann: @Towelliee there is not dungeon cap in prepatch, pally discord have tested it on 75+ different toons
[2:18:24] ZenjiBro: even if you can do a dungeon in 10 minutes, 30 is 5 hours of content per day per character
[2:18:25] Athaka: On beta we did 30 dungeons (bloodfurnace etc) in 11 hours
[2:18:27] gamingwithsat: which is 9 runs
[2:18:29] realdevv: GL questing on big servers.
[2:18:31] OneNetGaming: 30 isn’t much for boosting
[2:18:31] Holysal: 30 dungeons at 20mins is like 10 hrs ad day lol
[2:18:40] Tw1tchyy: Is this not just prepatch?
[2:18:40] TheOGMed: Best news ever is nameplate distance can be increased to 41 yards
[2:18:40] paddingwow: @Athaka what gear?
[2:18:43] shogon: also @Towelliee  hope ya all got /console nameplateMaxDistance 41 macro'd :)
[2:18:51] Athaka: Naxx geared chars + resto shaman premade 58
[2:18:52] Waspire: 50 was ideal
[2:18:55] Hazno: @Tw1tchyy correct
[2:18:56] slowsuby: @TheOGMed Agree. Thank fucking God
[2:18:59] crizby_89: damn update is 8 hours =[. gotta start the grind!
[2:19:00] brain_wash: LOL, because nobody plays WoW 10 hours a day.....
[2:19:05] paddingwow: did you get locked inbetween?
[2:19:06] starsk1e: fghjk
[2:19:10] einself111: Why don't they just confirm it with a bluepost ? This is so annoying
[2:19:13] Sceimoz: so when is it starting?
[2:19:13] OneNetGaming: So prepatch has no cap?
[2:19:15] OwlkahoIic: how long do you think maintenance is gonna take
[2:19:17] Deusey: Is there an xp nerf in classic questing starting with pre-patch?
[2:19:19] korver_: can someone tell me if they friggin fixed target healthbars in tbc compared to classic? it was SO annoying just seeing a big green/blue bar on my targets in classic. I want to see what their health/mana actually is!!

[2:40:33] Chromej: Don’t transfer main first
[2:40:33] daelorean: per character
[2:40:38] chipmonking: it'll all be fine, this is Blizzard's chance of using the sharding tech and making a smooth launch for the peeps to get behind it
[2:40:42] iggybadiggy: Remember mount guy!
[2:40:43] BlewGamingGroup: im betting EU will be less then 2 hours if things go "ok" on NA and they fix any problems tonight
[2:40:44] wraaith: dont you have to copy b e4 playing ?
[2:40:44] iggybadiggy: While youre there
[2:40:46] nightxcl0ud: 35 was a bit pricy
[2:40:46] Tighron: oh its down to 15 bucks now? ithought it was going to be 30
[2:40:46] Feldemort_vn: It’s a lot of stuff going on today, don’t think it’ll be up after 8 hours
[2:40:50] selling_cure: but why though lmao
[2:40:53] aleck1776: It better then the initial price
[2:41:01] Datzun1: Pre patch out yet? Lol
[2:41:03] Doedje: D:
[2:41:04] mouz53: Exactly who cares lol
[2:41:13] Waspire: can someone  whisper me the link for the instance cap?
[2:41:17] Znza: i had a rogue and they are shit till glaives LUL no thanks :)
[2:41:22] BigDP: I want to pay 30 USD. This is not fair for me.
[2:41:23] Walker1994: how do you plan to do the leveling process? dungeon grind?
[2:41:25] vaxian_0528: @Towelliee how much gold do you have on classic
[2:41:25] onyx_pupper: i wonder if this was a 5head move by blizzard to charge a high price to come down so people would be okay with 15$
[2:41:27] Daggerstry: It makes sense though. It takes money to hold server space for an old game
[2:41:28] EKS90_: World buff meta was the most boring thing about classic, so i have just been leveling prior to TBC
[2:41:30] Wholemane: Yea Vanilla is overrated as fuck
[2:41:31] odpw23: The classic player mentality is so garbage
[2:41:34] DudeInARobe: Realistically I’m curious as to how many people have more than 2 characters in classic lol
[2:41:35] Sonatta: i still don't understand why someone would want to be locked on a max progression character in Classic
[2:41:41] vaxian_0528: lets gooooo
[2:41:42] Hazno: @Waspire google "tbc classic instance cap"
[2:41:46] Aquadriel: i am glad they added the boost, because fuck playing classic lmao
[2:41:46] IronChi3f117: Exactly why I'm about to play through TBC, so I'll be ready for WoTLK lol
[2:41:55] kochen3: @Aquadriel Exacylu
[2:41:58] Progseb: What ?? it costs money to transfer classic character to TBC ??
[2:42:00] Doedje: You'll make a ton of gold in stratholm / scholomance farm if you want
[2:42:00] crawcook: Same reason I wont play Classic again, I would need a cool guild to enjoy it
[2:42:08] kochen3: @Aquadriel Oops, exactly*
[2:42:13] Broomba: @progseb no
[2:42:14] Skylin3r: @Progseb no, to leave a copy in classic
[2:42:15] igor93: i heard that mail between your own characters will be instant in TBC is that true?
[2:42:20] Progseb: oh i see
[2:42:20] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:42:20] Hazno: @Progseb no, just to clone your character to classic era servers
[2:42:21] odpw23: Yep
[2:42:25] Ooogachukka: TBC and WoTLK are absolutely the best few years of WoW
[2:42:25] Lykouralis_Trav: and didnt they reduce mail time for ur characters ?  but thc only i think
[2:42:30] selling_cure: honestly who tf would want to stay on classic
[2:42:32] aboringmac: what's leveling 1-60 in tbc like? any different?
[2:42:38] JasperXtreme: agreed
[2:42:39] Znza: then like $5-$10 max
[2:42:40] stresstest: inb4 Sharding of Classic and TBC Melding into one another
[2:42:44] Sonatta: first hit is free bttvNice
[2:42:44] kusosando: @aboringmac it takes about 30% less time
[2:42:46] DocsMistake: I mean you can play both, but if you want to keep your character on both it costs 15 bucks
[2:42:46] hnti86: Blizzard and free KEKW
[2:42:47] Daggerstry: I mean. Could you play Classic WoW and only Classic WoW when TBC originally came out?
[2:42:51] Blvdman: How many people actually have multiple chars at 60 tho they'd want to play
[2:42:52] elvia_: clone not even in the deluxe edition KEKW
[2:42:53] ReinholdtRanger: !tbc
[2:42:53] Moobot: @Totemwise Prepatch is in EXACTLY 7h 26m 12s || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[2:42:56] 91Niki: You basically need to pay 15 bucks if you want TWO versions of your character. One on Classic and one on TBC. ONLY if you want two versions of it
[2:42:57] MleveK: It was worded in a way that made is seem like the first was free.
[2:42:58] Dragonlord54: greed
[2:42:59] Lazarenth: it was never gonna be 35, 35 was just to make 15 look good
[2:42:59] gooni_coyg: maybe they should not allow to play classic :P
[2:43:01] kochen3: @aboringmac Reduced xp required by like overall 15%, more xp from quests 30-60. There is a whole list of QoL changes somewhere
[2:43:02] GameWithDerp: considering its a very simple DB transaction, its pretty outrageous
[2:43:03] aboringmac: @kusosando thx
[2:43:04] Aquadriel: cause they have us grabbed by the balls KEKW
[2:43:07] crawcook: Greed
[2:43:10] BlewGamingGroup: theyre going to see that when they dont get people paying to keep a toon on the classic server
[2:43:11] itsXekko: Classic era servers will be people flexing their t3 and not enough people to raid with. Totally pointless
[2:43:17] StoicTaurus: The same reason you pay for transfer on retail?
[2:43:18] Gibnek: Can you choose to play classic w/o tbc and not pay?
[2:43:26] bw_snakeeyes: !TBC

[2:43:28] Dirtnose: @Gibnek yes
[2:43:29] cahoots82: Because your sub used to pay for a single version of the game, now it pays for 2. Paying for 3 was maybe too much? I dunno
[2:43:34] AwkwardSoup: reset hasnt happened eh
[2:43:39] realdevv: @Towelliee Should i atleast copy my warrior? I have 9/9 T3, The Hungering Cold, Might of Menethil etc, would you?
[2:43:40] dalaraz: @Gibnek you only pay if you want to play both with the same char
[2:43:43] Sonatta: @Gibnek if you choose vanilla, you can never progress to BC
[2:43:45] frenzoll: Can you clone a boosted toon?
[2:43:46] billybaggens: guardian druid feels so good to play in retail
[2:43:53] Lycis: @gibnek as long as you subbed
[2:44:00] dalaraz: @frenzoll no
[2:44:07] Blvdman: @Gibnek TBC is free, if you migrate ur classic char to tbc its free, if u want to have ur char in both tbc and classic u pay. If you want to boost to 58 you pay.
[2:44:11] Aquadriel: just wait 4Head
[2:44:12] frenzoll: Ty @dalaraz
[2:44:19] Userjp: LOL conduit energy
[2:44:19] fistofnature: blizzard should let us buy conduit energy from the store LUL @Towelliee
[2:44:20] poonywow: what do u think about conduit energy overall? @Towelliee
[2:44:22] kazorax1: kazorax1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[2:44:35] Broomba: People don’t read blue posts or wow news in wow head
[2:44:44] Skylin3r: 15$ to have your character data populate 2 databases
[2:44:44] manmower: make everything 5 dollars
[2:44:52] Sonatta: conduit energy on the store... don't get them ideas @fistofnature monkaS
[2:44:54] Doedje: Cmon man, you dont wanna give Bobby some of your money?
[2:45:04] BlewGamingGroup: @Gibnek they are making all characters roll in to TBC ... the $15 is to keep your character on a server that will never allow you to progress it over 60
[2:45:04] Blvdman: I was laughing when people were saying $35 dollars was reasonable and giving excuses for blizzard
[2:45:08] Lycis: Blizzard selling conduit boosts 4Head
[2:45:12] MisterPooky: Bobby Kotick BagOfMemes

[2:45:22] YellowKiwi: Never say never ...
[2:45:24] Lycis: its only boosts and qol items
[2:45:27] Skylin3r: conduit potions
[2:45:27] Aro725: Theyre having you pay money becuase they dont want you to copy the character. If it was free everyone would do it and no one would play the chars. Then they would have to pay money to maintain dead servers no one uses. I kinda agree with them charging for it
[2:45:32] crawcook: Blizzard makes 10s of millions on subs alone, and even the profit margins are highc ompared to costs, anything extra is just squeezing extra results.
[2:45:36] PvtHudson093: buy Anime power for dollars
[2:45:44] bruhSit_farmer: isnt ffxiv more pop than wow these days ??
[2:45:48] iggybadiggy: Oh my god please loot ur vault bro @Towelliee I can't

[2:46:26] Aquadriel: blizzarddevsblow it takes a lot of effort be this retarded, but you somehow managed to easily do it
[2:46:32] Duckxx: @Towelliee That green hue in your background is looking sick dude :)
[2:46:33] CritcobainTV: 4Head
[2:46:35] Lothawia: When can we download TBC then?
[2:46:39] Alepouditsa: at list the don't sell bank space, or crafting beter % in the shop that the only thinking that i can't make my self to play other games with subs
[2:46:40] Deadlynedly: how long do you think a fresh belf will take you to lvl up?
[2:46:52] kokochris: love that green lights
[2:46:53] HeBeDead: they don't release sub info anymore
[2:46:54] Broomba: Amazing how many don’t know the time of reset in 10 years

[2:47:30] kokochris: ya i doubt they would do that.  not impossible, but they never went down that road
[2:47:31] Chibs243: @dirtnose So the idea that wow is, and will remain, the most populated mmo is speculation
[2:47:31] dalaraz: @Broomba yeah i never understood why people dont understand that its all about server time and not local :p
[2:47:32] brain_wash: if it's cash related, they have Already had the idea
[2:47:33] jackjonesiii: Rift killed WoW
[2:47:34] chopsaki: give it another sub drop.. gotta milk them whales
[2:47:38] Poriand: i think blizz was seeing if they could push it when they did the transmog shop item recently
[2:47:39] MFKnightS: well they didnt give us pay bag space they just made it to wear transmog you didnt need to hold anymore
[2:47:42] SilkeySmooth: blizzard is making enough off of players buying wow tokens for boosts every season
[2:47:45] Biorrwolf: I got a hunter at 24 that I wanted to get ready for TBC to help my pally, but didn't have the time. Should I still grind it to 60, or just jump right into my Belf Pally?
[2:47:47] Vataraa: SW TORs cash shop is far worse then WoWs
[2:47:52] onyx_pupper: this isnt BDO
[2:47:55] Rexialiton: Charity pets are cool. I respect that
[2:48:01] Lycis: New World like oh btw we testing boosts at Alpha

[2:48:08] Broomba: @dalaraz it’s the same time and day of week for 10 years
[2:48:16] grimsarmy: I always wonder why did they take away the head transmog cash shop items
[2:48:24] gudzzo: When can we buy the TBC Deluxe Edition in the Store?
[2:48:25] Doedje: I think they make quite alot from classic players who dont even touch retail
[2:48:30] BigBiffyB: I actually love SWTOR's store lol
[2:48:33] Renzay83: yep, one $60 boost is worth 4 months of someones sub
[2:48:34] SilkeySmooth: thats why blizzard will never the boosting problem
[2:48:37] Essysham: @Towelliee there was a time that people also thought "there's no way blizzard will offer a character boost in the store". Look where we are.
[2:48:38] elvia_: underwear
[2:48:42] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: They put BOE's on the AH, you can buy those with real money @Towelliee
[2:48:42] Poriand: MMos with housing makes alot of money lol
[2:48:43] S1appadabass: 6 CONSOLES
[2:48:44] SilkeySmooth: fix
[2:48:45] Jango_: @Towelliee  How was the casino on Sunday?
[2:48:46] HeBeDead: I think there's probably a lot ignorance about the business side
[2:48:56] elvia_: we are missing the underwear
[2:48:59] KombatWombat07: their brand is strong so merchandise the fuck out of it
[2:48:59] elvia_: for real
[2:49:01] Zonoxx_tv: You could argue that character boosts is already selling player power, just in a roundabout way

[2:49:06] Hazno: @Essysham pretty delusional unless people thought WoW wouldn't get a single expansion ever though LUL
[2:49:10] BRUTALIT0PS: I am assuming the casino was fun based on the Discord messages LUL
[2:49:13] NA_Mus: No lie, if blizz added the cloaks that alexstraza/ysera has I would buy it in a heartbeat
[2:49:16] crawcook: Merch probably isn't a significant number though
[2:49:17] joeydoughnuts82: Is flying for sure coming next patch?

[2:51:32] mulletrocker11358: i dont wanna wait a week tho.. i want to grind exalted!
[2:51:33] findobin: best in years but still trash
[2:51:38] Barret: we can complain  if we liked it gated behind rep grinds
[2:51:39] Scoodles91: but its not instant on login... REEEEE
[2:51:40] dalaraz: people are bitching no matter what nowadays,its a meta
[2:51:40] KombatWombat07: No rep required for flying right?
[2:51:41] kowaikoro: true
[2:51:42] Skylin3r: the new meta is time gating everything it seems
[2:51:42] Userjp: Do you see a future where WoW expanded to consoles? Not in a way  to be ever competitive, just to be something like "Hey, you can play in every platform"
[2:51:43] NA_Mus: the only pathfinder i hated was wod, the rest were just unlocked overtime
[2:51:43] Doedje: TBC flying meta though haha
[2:51:45] Renzay83: best flying meta in decades you mean LUL
[2:51:47] khrownoes: well i mean it is taking them long enough to get it out.
[2:51:50] Mayyo1987: 7 days?!? wtf man i want it in 6!!!!
[2:51:53] Hazno: @Aquadriel just portal to Oribos LUL
[2:51:57] Finsby_: Just because it's the best solution we've had in years doesn't necessarily mean it's good though
[2:52:01] Finsby_: But I like it
[2:52:10] Baldarsar: @Towelliee the only thing that sucks is that the allow all mounts in the Maw !!!
[2:52:12] scridderz: look at that new background ya gots.  looks good
[2:52:18] Alepouditsa: i like griding wq for something or for quests
[2:52:20] Ponickz: 200 gear for all too account wide
[2:52:21] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:52:31] gooni_coyg: do we need venari rep for anything in 9,1
[2:52:33] Poriand: im only ilvl 209
[2:52:37] Finsby_: Good alt catch-up is good, because trying to gear my 197 warrior alt right now is absolutely dreadful
[2:52:38] General_SushiBuns: im trying to gear 1 of each class so that sounds wonderful
[2:52:45] kokochris: ah thank god.  Ive been holding off one of my alts at 200 ilvl.
[2:52:47] JakubBae: damn Towelliee havent been here in a while, love the new background setup
[2:52:58] Chibs243: Blizz runs out of time and ideas to keep the game fresh. “Give them easy flying, that should keep them quiet for a bit”
[2:53:01] JiuJitsuChess: sharts of domination!
[2:53:03] Slacker82: i haven't played this expansion yet, is it good, worth it?
[2:53:05] retraptor: Stygia is more cosmetics and mount based I think
[2:53:08] kindrede66: PepeHands
[2:53:11] Hazno: @KythosMeltdown the zones are literal separate realms incredibly far apart, hence the "tunnel" thing when you fly from Oribos, so it wouldn't make sense being able to fly between them
[2:53:11] splekks: more of 0 is still 0
[2:53:16] Ponickz: torghast is kinda fun on the ptr now
[2:53:18] SilkeySmooth: no thx no more maw for me
[2:53:18] Privack: hopefully its more fun
[2:53:19] joeydoughnuts82: I quit after Cata. Came back at the end of BFA while furloughed and was expecting to ding 120 and go by flying skill. Needless to say I was annoyed.
[2:53:22] regalbeast: fun....
[2:53:23] mpmhall: Is Stygia going to be used to buy mounts?
[2:53:25] Aro725: at  least we can mount in the maw, idc about that anymore
[2:53:26] gooni_coyg: So no need to catch up rep for venari then. Cause i am behind on her rep.
[2:53:28] NA_Mus: I like the soulashe being no longer gated
[2:53:44] Atrosity: so as always, they've added to the game what needed added 6 months ago
[2:53:45] Ponickz: only 5 levels too pshh
[2:53:48] elvia_: the maw was in beta at release

[2:53:55] Skylin3r: covid's fault Kappa
[2:53:55] elvia_: now we have the full version
[2:53:55] inj0shwetrust: My alts are happy
[2:53:59] KombatWombat07: do you know if more/different abilities are added to torghast runs?
[2:54:27] Hazno: @KombatWombat07 they are making Torghast even more like a roguelike with permanent buffs between runs etc
[2:54:30] fistofnature: @Towelliee better late than never imo
[2:54:35] Aro725: max laxer of torghast now gives you 1040, so both wings will give you 2080 per week now
[2:54:49] KombatWombat07: @Hazno oh sweet
[2:54:49] bruhSit_farmer: im waiting for 9.3
[2:54:57] Doedje: Opinion: Classic wow saved wow, change my mind.

[3:07:50] BigBiffyB: @critcobain sure but the 4th healer in any healer group is gonna have low HP/s with gear levels where they are, granting EJ's healers in general look weak. The DPS isn't great from them AND the hP/s is low across the board

[3:09:44] BigBiffyB: @critcobain totally depends on your heal comp, where your healing cooldowns are assigned, etc. IN his particular case yes, all 4 of their healers look a little yikes to me, but there's no reason or benefit to doing extra healing if it's coverd off already.They also don't have 2x Rsham so I don't know what's going on

[3:15:53] DrakhanGaming: what level does the blood elf zone stop at?
[3:15:54] oldmangamer0: Im a booster :)
[3:15:58] Jessethoth: I wonder how the Classic mega server is going to work, I'm assuming it will have shards that are copies of the previous servers?

[3:16:05] odpw23: @bombayshow I feel that too LUL

[3:16:58] Aquadriel: more thorgast aesthetic ResidentSleeper
[3:16:58] odinsdad75: The real question is are the current horde races ready for all of incoming chad blood elves?
[3:16:58] MuttonChopins: anyone know if its better to level a prot or ret during pre-patch?
[3:17:20] captain_steve_rogers: it was to slow people down
[3:17:28] Jessethoth: @Sonatta So they'll force renames when all the copies go to the mega server?
[3:17:29] xideontv: go hunter and finish a wing under 10min
[3:17:31] sindrellaman7: the mega dung looks awsome imo
[3:17:31] Hazno: @Baleroc1 some racials are really good, and Horde/Alliance can finally have Paladins/Shamans respectively

[3:20:11] Sonatta: @Jessethoth you're hearing speculation... all the servers are getting cloned for classic, you're paying to unlock the clone
[3:20:18] billybaggens: bro gift him the mount pack
[3:20:19] NovaSun84: 100% same... Asmon was still doing TBC pre-pret like everyone else

[3:21:50] Amazanmartyn: @Gooners he passed away, cancer
[3:21:50] MasterNeff: He's said before he still likes the game, he just complains cause he wants it to be better.
[3:21:51] xluckydawgx: He wasnt invested????

[3:22:58] MuttonChopins: he also changed a lot of games state like Warframe
[3:22:59] AveragePvp: @jessethoth but with that argument he doesn’t need to do everything around wow he’s big enough to not do it all around wow
[3:22:59] krytsi: I like Zack as a person but fuck. 7 hours of stream a day on the same cycle of conversation every fucking day
[3:23:05] Jesperoni: it went really well lol, he just quit @kowaikoro it was some of his best content
[3:23:11] Hazno: fuck the random legendary drops in Legion, such an awful game design, ruined so much of Legion imo
[3:23:12] joeydoughnuts82: Do I have time to get a get my life together, get a new computer, level a character to 60, GET GUD, and convince my wife this is a good idea before TBC launches officially.
[3:23:14] Jessethoth: @AveragePvp I mean, he's tried variety and it tanked.

[3:23:30] NovaSun84: and also buy the MTX transactions along the way LULW
[3:23:30] Bombayshow: Asmong love wow , And if he quit wow will take a huge blow and he knows it and want to avoid it
[3:23:32] brain_wash: he aint wrong, until you stop paying for it, probably wont change much
[3:23:35] dkapocalypse: he shit he shit hard on that game  RIP TB
[3:23:39] Aquadriel: dings 60, gets 10k gold from viewers
[3:23:40] Funderik: he did 1-60 on his lock fully afk watching videos getting boosted kekw
[3:23:42] Jessethoth: @AveragePvp Possible he gets scared easy though, he probably could build around another game with commitment.
[3:23:42] belfastcl: true
[3:23:48] KythosMeltdown: In the MMO space theres no other game to play. FF art style is too off putting for some people. If there was another game Asmon liked he'd probably go play it, hence complaining about AoC/NW
[3:23:49] dtp4444: Lol so true
[3:23:51] krytsi: "fuck wow tokens" > gets given 5m gold in 5 minutes LUL
[3:24:03] Bombayshow: Asmongold loves wow if he quit Wow will take a huge blow and he doesnt want wow to die
[3:24:09] Jessethoth: I used to not believe in the "addict" thing but he might actually be a fucking addict.
[3:24:12] AveragePvp: @jessethoth yes having 10-20k vs 30k is tanking LUL
[3:24:12] 91Niki: @Bombayshow It won't take a blow because he quits wow, it will take a blow because all he does is complain and cause drama when he plays the game. If he stops doing that, all the spergs who are there for the drama will leave too
[3:24:13] JakubBae: damn im so lost, what is mtx
[3:24:13] oldmangamer0: He is a douche I had to stop watching him.
[3:24:14] toobaked1987: Asmon is never going to stick to his own convictions. He just wants to lead around a hate mob
[3:24:21] Baldarsar: @Bombayshow haha lol
[3:24:25] Jessethoth: @AveragePvp Hahaha true engouh.
[3:24:26] verZUNGE: lol asmon has nothing to do with wow's success
[3:24:31] Bombayshow: 91Niki everyone who complains with him will do it way more often
[3:24:34] Bombayshow: that my point
[3:24:41] krytsi: Asmon n the Doomer Crew
[3:24:42] Hazno: @Bombayshow if you honestly believe Asmongold keeps WoW alive you're delusional
[3:24:43] Jessethoth: I dunno man, I dropped WoW like a hard turd a few times when I wasn't happy with it.
[3:24:46] Rexialiton: @KubasKorner Micro transactions
[3:24:51] Jessethoth: But I get that I guess.
[3:24:54] spainard15: Azmon could not start a new toon and get all the stuff he has now with out people handing and giving him stuff so easy with out loosing his mind

[3:25:00] belfastcl: also, there are many mmos around healthy and growing without asmongold playing them, nw won't be the first one
[3:25:05] Tawlz: !server
[3:25:05] Moobot: @Tawlz Prepatch is in EXACTLY 6h 44m || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || TBC launch is on June 1st
[3:25:07] Bombayshow: Hazno I dont you are I never said it would Die I said it would take a huge blow
[3:25:11] Cidarr: anybody else just want sub prices to increase instead of mtx? $15 in 2004 if it kept up with inflation would be $21 today
[3:25:13] JakubBae: @Rexialiton thanks
[3:25:19] mrtit0v: Def is bad to Say something that u dont like and hate 100% and do it anyway. is showing a very bad example to humanity lol @Towelliee
[3:25:20] paddingwow: scotte6Wtf
[3:25:21] joeydoughnuts82: Go to your account tab
[3:25:23] Aro725: @Rayban22 Itll be today when servers are up you can use it
[3:25:29] Rexialiton: @KubasKorner nps :)
[3:25:32] Jessethoth: Reddit is such a shitty website, I'm sorry but I hate the way the categories and posts are layed out.
[3:25:33] Rayban22: @Aro725 Thanks! :)
[3:25:36] Hazno: @Bombayshow and that he doesn't want WoW to die, indicating that if he quits, WoW will die
[3:25:40] 91Niki: @Bombayshow I kinda doubt it. I think what is more likely to happen, is there will be less toxic uproar, because there isn't a "face" leading it. If that makes sense.
[3:25:49] Jessethoth: Like I don't care about the toxicity, that shit doesn't bother or scare me, the layout is so bad, that's what scares me.
[3:25:52] MuttonChopins: I still dont get why Asmon hates FF14 so much too
[3:25:53] Hazno: @Bombayshow that's literally what you said
[3:25:54] Bombayshow: Hazno that 40k people that will start to say that wow sucks since asmong doesnt play
[3:26:00] Bombayshow: ggs
[3:26:09] Lazarenth: true
[3:26:12] 91Niki: @Bombayshow It will still be there, but he is definitely making it louder with his rant streams, cuz he normalizes it
[3:26:14] swordart_19: SO TRUE
[3:26:30] Bombayshow: 91Niki Everyone normalize it , dont be an hypocrite
[3:26:31] TombStoneMercenary: Band Wagon!!!
[3:26:35] swordart_19: HIS CARRIER IS SHITTING for money
[3:26:38] Aquadriel: Someone who has really good and rational takes on the game (wow) is Max from limit, love watching and hearing his takes @Towelliee
[3:26:42] manmower: WoW is just a mob out for blood
[3:26:43] DelcoAF: @Towelliee WoW is so addicting that I stopped playing after wrath, graduated college, got a job a wife and kids, and am now watching some other dude play it on twitch lol that's addiction...
[3:26:50] 91Niki: @Bombayshow Towelliee doesn't, a lot of people doesn't. wdym everyone does ? LUL
[3:26:53] joeydoughnuts82: Just like its easy to shit on Michael Bolton, when he is in fact a FUCKING LEGEND.
[3:26:59] Bombayshow: 91Niki Kappa
[3:27:08] Jessethoth: You mentioned TB, something TB said was to not blindly agree with your influencers and question even what he said as to whether you personally agree.
[3:27:10] Funderik: moaning = content
[3:27:15] Lazarenth: max is like the yoda of WoW IMO
[3:27:20] joeydoughnuts82: @twoheadedeagle00 Same bro
[3:27:21] DarthVapour420: yeahs he's not necessarily wrong but the hypocrisy of his actions vs his statements is apparent.
[3:27:26] Chiphazzord: not being in character""
[3:27:28] Collected1: "click baity" was the word
[3:27:34] Jessethoth: So I see where you're coming from on that I think.
[3:27:35] DarthVapour420: sage like
[3:27:36] Aquadriel: he talked about asmongolds wow tweetlong last week, very insightful @Towelliee
[3:27:37] Chiphazzord: max is real vs asmond
[3:27:39] Hazno: love Max
[3:27:39] cDocB: he's very level headed @Towelliee
[3:27:42] br0fest0r: I mean max only cares about high end raiding, anything else doesnt matter to him.
[3:27:48] laughing_octopus: 100% asmon is doing this shit for extra clout

[3:27:56] DelcoAF: @twoheadedeagle00 lol sad
[3:28:00] MaMad666: Who is wise? I didn't hear the name
[3:28:01] Aquadriel: he just goes half pepega KEKW
[3:28:03] Jessethoth: Like I agree with a lot of what Zach says but the best way to not promote New World is to just skip it if they keep doing what he doesn't like.
[3:28:07] joeydoughnuts82: MAx
[3:28:09] DarthVapour420: limit max is wise
[3:28:10] Aro725: Max also suggests solutions instead of just bitch, thats all asmond does it bitch with no sugestion to make it better.
[3:28:12] Chiphazzord: although plus 1 clout from towelliee to max achived
[3:28:29] Funderik: idk why people are raging over new world anyway, it looks like it has no content at all anyway, it's a 1 week game.
[3:28:34] 91Niki: @Bombayshow You're not really making sense. Also idc about drama. I'm just here to chill :D
[3:28:40] MaMad666: ok. Well hands down, he is absolutely.
[3:28:41] Chiphazzord: thats legit
[3:28:43] Revelations45: get out of hear
[3:28:48] joeydoughnuts82: This stream and Max's are my faves.
[3:28:49] SavSona: Man if only I played xD
[3:28:50] Bombayshow: 91Niki same my dude :D
[3:28:50] mrtit0v: holy shiit
[3:28:51] cabalish: !bnet
[3:28:51] Moobot: @cabalish NA Btag | Towelliee#1402
[3:29:01] Jessethoth: He's frustrated, like he's hurting I think.
[3:29:02] belfastcl: @RS_Iron_Jay lot's of mmos that are big now started almost devoid of content, or with terrible content (eso/ffxiv)
[3:29:03] Chiphazzord: but there wont be conet in that year ust watch
[3:29:14] Jessethoth: It's his favorite thing but he doesn't know what else to do I guess.
[3:29:23] KythosMeltdown: you're missing the point. Theres literally no other MMO to play right now
[3:29:23] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:29:29] Jessethoth: Purely speculation, I mean I don't know the dude.
[3:29:43] Revelations45: Asmon to me this past 2 years only cries online but in person he does not say anything
[3:29:46] 91Niki: @Towelliee But ranting for 6 hours a day, give you more viewers 🤷
[3:29:46] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i rewatched yday that day9 vid about palyer feedback, goddamn felt so identified with what goes on wow rnow lmao
[3:29:48] Sonatta: blizzard is making terrible decisions.... mtx is bad for the game.... everyone coming to tomorrow's BC tournament?.
[3:29:54] Jessethoth: I will say, he's doing a lot more content in Shadowlands that he wasn't doing.
[3:29:58] thrakan84: sigh fail
[3:30:01] oldmangamer0: He is a crybaby
[3:30:01] cabalish: towUnforch towGold
[3:30:02] Jessethoth: He is being positive about that a bit.
[3:30:05] rsimpson105: Wait who is doing that lol
[3:30:06] Funderik: @belfastcl true but for some reason new world looks like it has even less then those, you gather shit, make shit, do dungeons and 20 man battles. it will die fast
[3:30:07] derElten: towUnforch
[3:30:11] pixxelina: not the first time we ve seen this bipolar behaviour
[3:30:13] dalaraz: he is just following the wave,no opinions to give @Towelliee
[3:30:15] belaham: @Towelliee  I think asmon feeds into his chat about the mtx and honestly it seems like he just likes to complain about everything
[3:30:23] thrakan84: 15 min respawn?
[3:30:27] cyclonos: @Towelliee  How do u feel about the 30 dungeon cap per day IN TBC classic?
[3:30:27] Jessethoth: D2 was pretty fucking solid.
[3:30:29] swordart_19: KEKW
[3:30:33] KythosMeltdown: What MMOS? for PC? Theres nothing except FFXIV with similar content to WoW and it has a very unappealing art style for many people
[3:30:34] NovaSun84: "imagination land"
[3:30:38] Collected1: i want my 1996 back god dammit
[3:30:43] DemonicGrizz: towUnforch
[3:30:45] Aquadriel: @Towelliee these people living in 1990's gaming era lmao
[3:30:48] captain_steve_rogers: Wait did someone find a delorian and we are back in the 80's
[3:30:48] DrakhanGaming: chat, whats the leveling spec for warlocks in tbc classic
[3:30:51] thrakan84: yeah there is just never anyone out here on ER so I can only do it so much. lol
[3:30:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: i am so ready for ashes of creation to release and we see who is a hypocrit
[3:30:55] NovaSun84: We get those now Towelliee it's called "Remaster" when they just rebrand the 15 year old good game
[3:30:57] xALcaPWNedx: FF14 looks great tho lol
[3:30:58] belfastcl: @RS_Iron_Jay I agree with you on the content being lacking, but the base of the game seems something you could build something upon
[3:31:01] sagethemage40: its actually getting exhausting dealing with these people living in a fantasty world
[3:31:02] crashoverride_gaming: towHi
[3:31:13] spundancekid808: When does the prepatch drop?
[3:31:17] Jessethoth: MODERN games, definitely won't go without MTX, I agree, but there was plenty of good shit that came before MTX existed.
[3:31:21] MOLAR305: dude some games like Raid Shadowlegends can milk me for $200, since i have spent way more than that in my monthly WoW sub
[3:31:26] Baldarsar: @Towelliee  can you  post the link for the weak aura for the mouse cursor pls
[3:31:26] belfastcl: ashes verbal NDA was lifted, so people who played the alpha can talk about it now
[3:31:29] laughing_octopus: @KythosMeltdown u can buy story skip boosts in ffxiv store xD
[3:31:35] manmower: government subsidies
[3:31:38] Biorrwolf: The blood of Jeff Bezos
[3:31:53] oldmangamer0: Your 100% right
[3:31:57] cabalish: towUnforch
[3:31:59] MuttonChopins: Ashes has a cash shop but Asmon seems to be hyping that up a bit and doesnt seem to shit on it a lot, New World is B2P and has a cash shop and shits on it a lot more than Ashes
[3:31:59] TombStoneMercenary: Once people get shit for free it becomes really hard to convince them to pay for it........
[3:32:00] ScytaleTv: Star Wars Old republic
[3:32:03] Funderik: breaking even is never a companies goal, they want profit.
[3:32:03] duhworks: bdo should be dead but it has a store
[3:32:07] Sinamun1: unless you own cs go :D
[3:32:09] tenmillion: even Guild Wars, one of the earliest buy to play, has tons of MTX-styled things
[3:32:11] LSBreed: buy the box. that's all you get. no updates, no new content.
[3:32:13] OG_Fear: Swtor would be dead without a store
[3:32:13] Poriand: I miss wildstar
[3:32:15] OG_Fear: Lol
[3:32:16] Blvdman: People would rather have F2P with mtx than B2P with mtx
[3:32:17] Jessethoth: It makes me wonder how they have the Diablo 2 servers up for 21 years.
[3:32:20] sindrellaman7: i'm still having a hard time understanding where game development went from paying people to beta test your game to having players pay YOU for testing..
[3:32:23] Dirtnose: Yeah SWTOR would be dead years ago with a store lol
[3:32:24] KinggKebab: If it's not linked to end game or player power, then really, who gives a shit?
[3:32:26] Torswan: subscriptions?
[3:32:26] ProClicker: SWTOR is doing both
[3:32:27] LSBreed: mtx fuels new content.
[3:32:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: why do you think skyrim got released 10 times over the years? make that money
[3:32:33] manmower: as long as the mtx isn't bag space and basic functionality, seems fine
[3:32:36] Lycis: Yea Actions still speaks louder than words as Towelliee says
[3:32:44] mrtit0v: the Real problem is that his WORLD Economy is WAYY higher than before.
[3:32:47] Alepouditsa: i pefer it is is ptp then ftp
[3:32:48] DelcoAF: preach
[3:32:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:32:51] Murphybrown: give it a few weeks before opening a store, then do whatever you want
[3:32:53] Torswan: subscriptions
[3:32:54] brain_wash: this is the bleed over of the, everything should be free mindset, buckle up
[3:32:55] KythosMeltdown: buy making a game that doesnt suck balls
[3:32:56] Iolgz: some people dont understand that mtx can actually be seen as a GOOD thing for a game, mtx = more revenue = more staff/resources = beter game, take that away then.. you get what you pay for
[3:32:56] Dirtnose: You can sub to SWTOR but its more of a buy in access to get expansions which you only need to do once
[3:32:59] Znza: cosmetics are the best way to do micros tbh
[3:32:59] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: subs @Towelliee thats what makes them money. Make a good game, that's how they make money.
[3:33:02] Znza: it doesnt hurt anyone
[3:33:03] fizzle_fox: people so cheap and entitled. games cost way more to develop especially MMO's. Yet people expect F2P games with no/cheap micro tranmsactions
[3:33:05] Torswan: Subscriptions
[3:33:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: one word: Doge Kappa
[3:33:09] KythosMeltdown: raise the sub price
[3:33:09] SilverMyr13: doesn'tPoE have also cosmetics?
[3:33:10] quju_: mtx is perfectly fine imo as long as theres no p2w
[3:33:15] dalaraz: they shouldgive money to play their games i say@
[3:33:16] jacooners: they wanta sub
[3:33:21] Revelations45: how does the game suck balls @KythosMeltdown
[3:33:23] Hazno: people need to get out of their basement more often
[3:33:23] fizzle_fox: WoW sub cost is literally the same price now as it was in 2004 despite costing way more to maintain/develop
[3:33:23] porowozek: fucking PoE devs selling dem cosmetics for free game! Kappa
[3:33:28] manmower: they should double the sub cost
[3:33:30] Darkmos: Darkmos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[3:33:36] OhNoNotAgain: we need more towelliee rants like this
[3:33:37] OneNetGaming: They are going to take all that box money and put it in GameStop stock in hope it pops off again
[3:33:38] Hazno: people are fucking morons
[3:33:43] HeBeDead: can you say grinds my gears again @towelliee
[3:33:43] KythosMeltdown: just raise the sub price if 15$/mo isn't enough money
[3:33:44] Elementlolz1: are we talking about asmon?
[3:33:44] jacooners: They want a sub model instead
[3:33:45] aTufo: they should still wait atleast a few months until they have XP boosters
[3:33:47] Torswan: You dont need mtx if you have subscriptions. It is the whole point of the sub model.
[3:33:48] yshtola1337: i dont mind earnin mounts but just dont set them all at 1% thats stupid
[3:33:48] Nixel_: why do people care so much about it like you can just not buy stuff
[3:33:49] Dirtnose: Isnt new world buy to play? Those games rely on stores lol
[3:33:51] Lycis: Ashes has a subscription and cosmetic shop just like WoW
[3:33:53] xideontv: i would pay a BoA rep system in WoW
[3:33:53] campingking615: dirka dirka
[3:33:56] aTufo: i dont mind cosmetics and all
[3:33:59] Funderik: he's forgotten what the word COSMETIC means honestly..
[3:34:08] Alepouditsa: wait what? realy
[3:34:08] Blvdman: lmao not paying monthly for any sub games anymore
[3:34:09] toobaked1987: Asmons sheep are lead by a giant hypocrite, its sickening.
[3:34:12] Hazno: @KythosMeltdown OR just provide optional cosmetic MTX
[3:34:14] Lazarenth: Ashes is gonna suck ass, any "im making my dream game" is ass
[3:34:17] KinggKebab: Is this another one of those times, people are just using it as a reason to sook and complain and for streamers apparently complaining is "content"
[3:34:19] SavSona: I love the people saying subscriptions, but that only works if the subscription is fairly priced. Most people don't want to fork out monthly
[3:34:20] Jessethoth: I think as long as MTX mounts and pets aren't recolors of existing ones, that would be the little detail to correct.
[3:34:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: if you release the cash shop before the game its fine Kappa
[3:34:22] manmower: did they increase the sub price in the last 16 years?
[3:34:23] Skeezitz: i think people were just more upset that they were considering some P2W items
[3:34:25] Poriand: why hasnt a mmo done a cheaper sub? its always 15
[3:34:26] MuttonChopins: its cool as long as I'm hyped for it basically
[3:34:28] Znza: but thats okay :)
[3:34:29] belfastcl: LUL LUL
[3:34:33] KythosMeltdown: Cosmetics take away from the achievement in game.
[3:34:34] DarthVapour420: legit though i ain't buying alpha but i am hype for ashes

[3:35:06] fizzle_fox: AoC is still like 2 years from release
[3:35:07] ReinholdtRanger: !tbc
[3:35:08] manmower: they can balance it after release
[3:35:10] sticksaredrifting: ashes of copium
[3:35:12] laughing_octopus: unreal engine is dogshit
[3:35:16] splekks: Another Star Citizen on the cards?
[3:35:19] Collected1: ooof
[3:35:19] LSBreed: without subs, how would games pay for people to update, maintain, and add new content?
[3:35:20] Revelations45: But they are ready for that 500 dollars @Towelliee
[3:35:22] Dirtnose: yeah, people will play that alpha and deem it shit despite it not being finished
[3:35:29] Collected1: thats core engine stuff
[3:35:32] LSBreed: subs or stores*
[3:35:36] Lycis: Steven delayed the Alpha already a month, remembering what you said
[3:35:38] Poriand: why are subs always 15? why doesnt a company try a lower amount?
[3:35:38] Aquadriel: for only 500 bucks
[3:35:39] Hazno: @KythosMeltdown no it wouldn't.. you can't buy Ahead of the Curve mounts etc in the store, there's a clear difference between store mounts and mounts only obtainable in-game
[3:35:39] DallTV_: Ashes is the same as star citezen
[3:35:39] Funderik: thats ok tho
[3:35:45] Chiphazzord: if the ore is bad the game will fail
[3:35:46] DarthVapour420: star citizen of mmos?
[3:35:47] Chiphazzord: core
[3:35:51] Baldarsar: @Towelliee  wgats the weak aura for your mouse cursor?
[3:35:54] belfastcl: also, ashes will have headstart servers, how is that not p2w
[3:35:54] paddingwow: PREPATCH POGGERS
[3:35:54] easterk: KPOPTT
[3:35:55] Baldarsar: h
[3:35:55] krytsi: @DallDK yep
[3:36:01] jambii03: what are your thoughts on ESO?
[3:36:05] Blvdman: LMAO
[3:36:10] Torswan: MMOs should be subscription based. Cosemetic mtx is terrible for the game, it devalues hard earned gear.
[3:36:10] Biorrwolf: Star Citizen is one hell of an Alpha though
[3:36:11] KythosMeltdown: @Hazno Copium
[3:36:20] Dirtnose: How is it like star citizen? Doesn't that game  have MTX and its not even finished yet. I don't get the correlation there between that and AOC
[3:36:32] Baldarsar: @Towelliee  ccan i get link pls
[3:36:35] Nuggnuts: !headset
[3:36:41] Bernardo994: and it was $500 do test
[3:36:46] Sonatta: so what i'm hearing is Ashes needs 3-5 more years LUL
[3:36:47] Ardailec: I honestly think Asmon's issue with cosmetic MTX is that he's a completionist, so he feels he *has* to get it.
[3:36:52] ProClicker: The next swtor released unfinished
[3:36:53] Lycis: headstart had every nornal mmo expansion lol
[3:37:08] Dirtnose: How long has ashes been in development for? MMOs take a long time. Think WoW took 5-6 years right?
[3:37:19] Blvdman: Years and Years lmaoo
[3:37:19] Sablehawk_TV: They need a couple more years, at least.
[3:37:19] Lycis: True especially Asmongold
[3:37:27] Nuggnuts: What headset do you have Towelliee?
[3:37:31] easterk: AngelThump
[3:37:33] krytsi: for sure dont let the doomer get his hands on it
[3:37:35] skaya86: Especially asmon's viewerbase*
[3:37:45] Collected1: that MMO is DOA by the sounds of it
[3:37:46] yepman9: yea they completely miss the point
[3:37:47] pixxelina: absolutely
[3:37:48] Dirtnose: Sad but true
[3:38:04] Lycis: Asmongold isn't real searching for excuses
[3:38:04] MuttonChopins: dont people complain its fine to complain when WoW is in its alpha stage?
[3:38:04] Sinamun1: true all about first impression
[3:38:12] TombStoneMercenary: Thats how the whole world works!
[3:38:12] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee if it looks like shit, if it smells like shit...must be shit
[3:38:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: $500 andys in for a surprise
[3:38:17] Collected1: * adds ashes to the list containing pantheon
[3:38:18] Biorrwolf: Remember Rift was going to be a WoW killer
[3:38:37] manmower: i think ashes of creation is even behind camelot unchained in development
[3:38:44] Jessethoth: I mean, the lead dev did say not to pay 500 just for the acces @HaxzorJimDuggan Not to simp for the game.
[3:38:47] easterk: lol
[3:38:51] Jessethoth: I'm kind of neutral on it.

[3:38:58] Lazarenth: ashes of copium for sure
[3:39:00] Jessethoth: I will say Asmon said NOT TO OVERHYPE IT.
[3:39:01] belfastcl: 2 years seems generous
[3:39:04] Biorrwolf: So who's ready for the next Fable?
[3:39:06] Jessethoth: But the damage is done.
[3:39:12] Dirtnose: @Biorrwolf Rift was fun, but yeah every new MMO is a WoW killer. SWTOR, Wildstar, ESO all had the same tag attached
[3:39:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: people will though
[3:39:12] yepman9: @HaxzorJimDuggan nah. i purchased it and everyone seemed to know what they were getting into in the nda discord. i didnt see a single person complain while playing
[3:39:16] Collected1: ooof
[3:39:21] moxing_hei: ooof
[3:39:25] Lianor52: is ashes of creation a wow killer
[3:39:28] Jessethoth: Ideas are ideas until they're in play.
[3:39:32] Hazno: @Lianor52 no
[3:39:33] yepman9: @HaxzorJimDuggan then they could refund
[3:39:34] Bernardo994: i dont wanna be involed in them making the game just make it
[3:39:35] spanij: i wish it come in consols
[3:39:38] HeBeDead: sounds like they're running out of money and gotta push a build out
[3:39:40] DrakhanGaming: What spec should I level on my blood elf lock as? aff destro or demo
[3:39:42] Aquadriel: wow wins, bobby kotick our saviour EZ Clap
[3:39:42] sticksaredrifting: ashes will fail before it even gets going
[3:39:43] dallasjames83: wow itself will be the only wow killer
[3:39:43] Jessethoth: And an alpha is still just an idea, we must quell the hype.
[3:39:51] Jessethoth: Said that shit for years ^
[3:39:58] Lycis: @lianor52 the next one right after New World
[3:40:13] oldmangamer0: The Alpha is going to be pushed back again smh
[3:40:14] Jessethoth: My GF played it at PAX West and loved it, not sure if that was the same  build though.
[3:40:24] Collected1: thats basic stuff you fix before it even gets in the hands of the public
[3:40:24] kharnij83: @towelliee is new worlds combat just an EOS clone?
[3:40:29] Hazno: loving how the bubbles in the pools are all in sync LUL
[3:40:49] Sablehawk_TV: And they turn on God Mode :P
[3:40:50] belfastcl: @kharnij83 nw doesn't have animation cancelling (that i know of) and seems slower paced
[3:40:53] Jessethoth: We know they're on a way later build compared to what they've let people play for sure.
[3:40:54] biirrd: They are on a Dev Sandbox runing on there local machine
[3:40:56] oldmangamer0: The good ol bait and switch
[3:41:02] jerexify: @Towelliee Got an Alliance Oondasta ready to go. Don't have a Horde over there, unfortunately.
[3:41:07] Jessethoth: We have to see how their net code works and stuff.
[3:41:13] PokerFaceMoose: one thing i saw that was important was one tester said, you arent going to see anything that you havent already. the videos up to this point have shown it all
[3:41:15] duffluv22: The game I would like to see is a fallout style game for the ps5 since we lost Bethesda...lol
[3:41:18] kharnij83: is it a bar swap style?
[3:41:20] Blvdman: I've been saying it since AoC made their trailer. That they're game is horribly unoptimized and very unlikely to change lol
[3:41:33] Jessethoth: That's the real question, it can be beautiful on a private machine but will it hold up through the internet.
[3:41:39] manmower: sounds like same praise we give wow
[3:41:41] pixxelina: the mounts though, very mediocre looking imo
[3:41:48] belfastcl: i worry more about the code and servers than the art team
[3:41:49] Riproarin999: art teams always be doing all the heavy lifting lol
[3:41:54] Lycis: Yea the Art is amazing and detailed
[3:42:02] Jessethoth: I describe it's art style as a nice balance between WoW and Guild Wars 1.
[3:42:15] MoTiioN_Gaming: It can have an art trailer
[3:42:16] Hazno: @duffluv22 the closest you'll get atm is probably The Outer Worlds
[3:42:17] N3llee: Just tuning in... we talking about AoC?
[3:42:24] Lycis: Too many systems still too basic in Alpha
[3:42:25] Jessethoth: Dude, they HAVE to fucking get tanking right, I been a tank for decades now.
[3:42:25] yepman9: the characters strafe weird. the upper body doesnt move but the legs do
[3:42:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: they will delay the next no nda alpha and blame 9.1, then delay again for new world
[3:42:33] duffluv22: @hazno true
[3:42:40] Sonatta: ugh... SWTOR did that with Juggs and Guardians
[3:42:42] DigitalChill: @N3llee yep yep
[3:42:52] oldmangamer0: @HaxzorJimDuggan your 100% right
[3:43:08] Jessethoth: 9.1 and New World literally will buy AoC time, might even have been planned.
[3:43:08] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:43:13] Dirtnose: It's been in development for 5 years so far. Sounds like it just needs more time. Game needs to be nearly finished before any public build comes out imo
[3:43:24] Hazno: LUL
[3:43:36] Sonatta: sounds Alpha AF
[3:43:36] Blvdman: Didnt ashes of creation make a BR to address such issues?
[3:43:46] Hazno: just launch it as Early Access Kappa
[3:43:53] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee If someone complains about price but buys it anyway why would the company ever change the price then? Or service KEKW
[3:43:58] Aquadriel: @Towelliee cant even compare it to wow demos in blizzcon
[3:44:07] SilkeySmooth: hopefully ashes is out after classic wrath
[3:44:09] madmar1009: pre patch still pending...
[3:44:10] keeindordel: the RNG gods blessed me today on all my alts all did their +15 for the week and all got 226 weapons ;3 @Towelliee  <3
[3:44:16] krytsi: same lula, same
[3:44:27] CallMeWallie: Towelliee doing a big world boss?
[3:44:28] zSKIz1: does she do crossfit or what
[3:44:31] Sonatta: you know your game is in trouble when DayZ is in a better state LUL
[3:44:33] zSKIz1: orangetheory?
[3:45:00] CallMeWallie: Ah,
[3:45:00] duffluv22: is anyone else seeing double texts in chat?
[3:45:09] homiethecanadian: How many attempts was sha mount?
[3:45:14] Hazno: @duffluv22 nope, try refreshing
[3:45:20] RushRunner: 2023... let me show you my friend Star Citizen
[3:45:32] MaMad666: @Towelliee How was WoW alpha?
[3:45:50] SilkeySmooth: 2023 should be mid to end classic wrath
[3:45:54] Erielle04: @RushRunner 2028
[3:45:58] stubbedub: !TBC
[3:45:58] Moobot: @drasse33 Prepatch is in EXACTLY 6h 23m 7s || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[3:46:01] Biorrwolf: You mean Wrath Classic
[3:46:03] manmower: by 2024 they'll have straight back undead
[3:46:04] moxing_hei: He know Kappa
[3:46:12] krytsi: troll shoes Pog
[3:46:15] r0b0tak0s: towUnforch towUnforch
[3:46:17] swordart_19: wow looks good newer stuff
[3:46:18] yepman9: my mage blink animation only worked like half the time too. when i blinked it looked like i was just glitching foward
[3:46:19] Hazno: stylized graphics will always be superior in games like this, it simply doesn't look as dated as "realistic" graphics at the time
[3:46:23] Biorrwolf: And a retail expansion that's dead after a month
[3:46:23] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:46:25] TiredCarcass: i hope
[3:46:25] Frozen_DK: i really do hope so, the comic style is nice and all but a change of scenery would be poggers
[3:46:31] SmokyBlind: is prepatch online for all at the same time or is na 1 day ahead of eu?
[3:46:33] Kelwinnz: :3
[3:46:34] MuttonChopins: so they are working on their new WoW engine?
[3:46:37] SilkeySmooth: mount store 2.0 inc
[3:46:39] Poriand: then my pc wont be able to run it
[3:46:41] swordart_19: @hazno true
[3:46:42] Soproatlol: sure towellie
[3:46:43] GoKu1g: What are the possibilities for future expantions though??
[3:46:43] Hazno: @SmokyBlind NA today, EU tomorrow
[3:46:44] duffluv22: Unreal Engine?
[3:46:49] Biorrwolf: Riot?
[3:46:56] jacooners: when is riot's coming out lol
[3:47:00] Patadot: WoW 2 prepatch was WoD and WoW 2 is Legion, game changed so much from before
[3:47:20] darthvapor420: wait dev team has a new engine in the books you think?
[3:47:24] MuttonChopins: Ghostcrawler announced it last year so it wont be for long while @jacooners
[3:47:24] Clover__North: What time do you think prepatch will launch?
[3:47:28] Try_Nothing: !weakauras
[3:47:28] Moobot: @Try_Nothing we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[3:47:30] Biorrwolf: Any thoughts on Lightforge Studios?
[3:47:31] JMANIzawesome: @Towelliee I don't think they will make a new engine literally for 10+ years. Wow still prints money and the engine is not causing as much trouble as it is worth to completely remake everything. Unfortunately its more likely that they literally make a new game than update the engine
[3:47:37] SmokyBlind: @at midnight i can play draenei /b11 or did i need to wait for morning 9am maintendence
[3:47:38] Tecni: Do you have any info on Riots MMO, like whispers you have heard? @Towelliee
[3:47:39] DrakhanGaming: 2030 is when riot mmo will come out
[3:47:45] SilkeySmooth: are you sure riots mmo isnt a moba mmo?
[3:48:08] pronkk_: me want mop classic
[3:48:19] jacooners: i hope that wow would make a wow 2 reset type of deal
[3:48:21] Godrick85: @Towelliee  why no cata classic>
[3:48:22] darthvapor420: would it incorporate all old excpacs? or a separate fresh start?
[3:48:32] othraerir: where will they find the time/
[3:48:36] krytsi: I think WoW engine is just something constantly in the works as a side project that'll just be thrown in when they deem it worthy enough
[3:48:40] truxcat: cant wait for WoD classic

[3:48:40] Skara_XD: I would actually play cata classic
[3:48:40] fewyn: i want legion classic
[3:48:41] madmar1009: So the prepatch still has the servers down?
[3:48:42] GoKu1g: As long as the new engine doesnt lag in mass world pvp then its Gucci
[3:48:43] Jetstreak_: MoP Classic please
[3:48:44] snuffles_80: anyone know if epic mount/skill gets cheaper in TBC pre-patch?
[3:48:45] stresstest: BFA classic soonTM
[3:48:47] Zettabyte: @Towelliee just tested the gFuel  bubble gum flavo. Hmmm it sure is now what I expected, but it's not too bad I guess :)
[3:48:50] Sonatta: now that Blizzard has all this experience with retail reading classic data... there's no reason for them not to go full new engine and just convert the old data real time like classic
[3:48:51] rbailey_2222: i want Wod CLASSIC kAPPA
[3:48:52] SilkeySmooth: id play a legion classic
[3:48:53] BlewGamingGroup: why no cata ... cause no one wants to play that shit
[3:48:53] onous_: We want to forget Cata.
[3:48:58] Ardailec: @Othraerir they just drop an entire raid tier for it like they did with WoD
[3:48:59] jacooners: they should do wow 2 and then have a legacy where you can play all the expans and there are resets  that go through all the content
[3:49:00] madmar1009: was hoping the hardcores would have leveled out before i got home...
[3:49:00] MuttonChopins: it sounds like they might do a PoE 2 thing or a Source 2 Engine  thing
[3:49:00] KiLLERJA0: i cant wait for WoD classic
[3:49:00] ThaOriginalGamester: Legion classic 2037
[3:49:01] NightChappy: BFA classic cant wait
[3:49:02] swordart_19: Rtx illumination inc
[3:49:04] TombStoneMercenary: SL classic
[3:49:05] Tecni: Shadowlands classic HYPE!
[3:49:06] billybaggens: classic-wrath golden years of wow
[3:49:08] krytsi: LETS LIVE DRAGON SOUL LFR AGAIN PogChamp
[3:49:11] idenkaz_: I'd play the shit out of Legion all over again. yes I would. insert copium
[3:49:13] dcmaniac11: Cata classic pog
[3:49:15] Hazno: I just wish we'd get the option to use modern textures/models/effects in Classic PepeHands
[3:49:20] jambii03: what are your thoughts on ESO?
[3:49:20] LawnSpeaker: Cata classic onwards would be good at an accelerated pace
[3:49:23] SilkeySmooth: legion classic hype
[3:49:31] swordart_19: HE KNOWS
[3:49:34] all_beef_franks: How long are you anticipating leveling your BE to take with the reduced exp and the quests being adjusted?
[3:49:36] Colt_Engineer: for 10.0 I could see updated graphics
[3:49:36] MrSnekyDino: !remindme 2024
[3:49:38] rhodeos_: eso is a fantastic solo adventure
[3:49:48] MaMad666: @Towelliee The most silly people are those who call WoW devs incompetent and regarded, and when they are leaving the company they are beloved and jewel that are running away LUL
[3:49:49] Zettabyte: @Towelliee can't wait for our DoomFuel xD
[3:49:49] LawnSpeaker: Cata was also fun as a hunter
[3:49:52] duffluv22: Hell...if graphics cards will be available....lol
[3:49:55] wanderergod: blizzard making logical decisions.... LUL
[3:50:00] Skara_XD: Im still trying to find a f2p mmo that actually is fun ESO/BDO shit like that is not it

[3:50:14] wilZifer: hahaha clock clocks wilzifRunty wilzifRunty
[3:50:20] fizzle_fox: GW2 has a new expansion coming out soon
[3:50:20] Bayne77: you young whipper snappers and your tic tocks and your thingamadoodles
[3:50:21] SilkeySmooth: eso is stagnant nothing game changing like wiw does
[3:50:23] GoKu1g: @SkarasBlade wait 10 years when WoW goes F2P
[3:50:25] belfastcl: ESO is a stable mmo, never has dramatic changes, which appeals to some people
[3:50:27] RushRunner: @Towelliee what could they have done different to make wild star succesful?
[3:50:27] fizzle_fox: GW2 was always pretty fun
[3:50:33] krytsi: I like ESO but It's never something I've been able to sink time into like I do WoW/FF
[3:50:36] Skeezitz: Nvidia will have the 5k series too and people will still be trying to get 3080s
[3:50:38] MuttonChopins: GW2 is pretty fun to play very casually
[3:50:43] Biorrwolf: ESO is more about enjoying TES atmosphere
[3:50:45] DelcoAF: you know wow is the facebook of games because towel says things like "tick tocks and clock clocks"
[3:50:46] darthvapor420: i really like ESO and the PVP is suuuuper fun
[3:50:46] grapyz: its very lore heavy wgich is good if that's what your into !
[3:50:54] probablyrandall: combat keeps me from really enjoying eso, although i love the exploration
[3:50:56] fizzle_fox: Yeah I wish GW2 had a more hardcore engame like mythic raiding
[3:50:57] duffluv22: @skeezitz exactly
[3:50:58] Dirtnose: I dont like the combat in ESO. I prefer the tab target classic style personally
[3:51:05] idenkaz_: its canon too so yeah
[3:51:06] wanderergod: GW2 has a horrid story and dungeon mechanics. but the classes, combat, and ui were amazing
[3:51:07] fizzle_fox: Cuz GW2 combat is really good
[3:51:08] Biorrwolf: Oddly enough, going to try FFXIV today for the first time
[3:51:10] SilkeySmooth: you obviously havent played eso pvp its broken..lol
[3:51:14] Znza: @Skeezitz unless they can change the material its made of ye, its doomed with no light in sight
[3:51:20] Clover__North: How long do you think the prepatch wait will be at this point @Towelliee ?
[3:51:21] LawnSpeaker: What about cata classic at an accelerated pace with no lfr?
[3:51:25] Biorrwolf: Then probably immediately go to TBC lol
[3:51:27] Poriand: ESO servers are bad
[3:51:34] belfastcl: they tapped on a niche that wasn't entirely utilized by wow, which has allowed them to grow
[3:51:37] Sonatta: @Biorrwolf nice, enjoy the next 200 hours of your life to get caught up for the next expansion :)
[3:51:50] krytsi: next kill for sure Kappa
[3:51:52] eldacal: i was an Emperor on one of the original Cyro servesr, stopped playing because of the everpresent lag
[3:51:53] SilkeySmooth: that just added scaling proc sets the time to kill in eso is faster then a call of duty game..lol
[3:51:55] jerexify: Quick, Alliance next! lol
[3:51:57] cabalish: towUnforch
[3:52:05] MuttonChopins: so far for me in FF14 its fun but I know people say its slow for the base game but the 1st expansion that is free is pretty good @Biorrwolf
[3:52:14] eldacal: and they made the groups a max of 12 players because of the performance issues
[3:52:31] Biorrwolf: @sonatta we'll so how hard the trial hooks me, or how it goes on stream
[3:52:35] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee do you think that the LOTR MMO from Amazon would of been any comp if they would of went through with it?
[3:52:35] jerexify: All my Horde are on the same server as yours, so I can't help you much there. lol
[3:52:39] spanij: @Towelliee how much time for server up
[3:52:53] 91Niki: belt HYPERS
[3:52:53] onous_: Id play ESO over FF14
[3:52:54] xXSiebzehnXx: @tacovendor93 once you level more there are more oGCD abilities that fill in the gcd gaps
[3:52:56] krytsi: BELT PogChamp
[3:52:57] thrakan84: close rip
[3:53:01] duffluv22: SWOTR had soooo much potential!!!

[3:53:36] thrakan84: lol just look at LoTRO right now

[3:53:37] MuttonChopins: I'm disappointed LOTR got cancelled, I was pretty hyped for it
[3:53:38] Sonatta: @Biorrwolf i suspect it'll hook you, it's just not a good stream game :)

[3:54:08] wanderergod: FF XIV is a good story, end game, ok combat, cluttered ui. SWTOR is great, but small community with a lot of bottlenecking to access end game.

[3:57:12] MuttonChopins: has there been a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes for the LOTR show?
[3:57:27] wanderergod: Tencent wanted some creative rights that Amazon was not willing to give. Also it is believed that the Tolkien family said no to Tencent requests regarding monetization strategy (not confirmed though). @Towelliee

[3:57:53] xXSiebzehnXx: It is story driven
[3:57:55] HeBeDead: swtor is fun to level in. not much end game imo
[3:57:58] manmower: tencent is government-owned/backed, hard to compete against that
[3:58:10] wanderergod: SWTOR is great. there are subscription bottlenecks, other than that amazing. @Jambit03

[3:59:52] Hazno: the later SWTOR cinematics are insane, with the two brothers and the other one with the young girl
[4:00:03] Dirtnose: LOTRO has biggest world in a game ever that isn't procedural except for I think daggerfall
[4:00:05] Molvonos: Boosting a resto shaman, good for me, good for Blizzard's multi-dollar penny pouch.
[4:00:06] xXSiebzehnXx: @the_jiffah I felt like LOTRO was beautiful, but they were horrible at illustrating depth on the map
[4:00:10] MistaHat: yeah i mean, star wars has literal worlds in a galaxy
[4:00:23] soysos91: there's no free boost for TBC classic right?

[4:12:03] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee i think questing will be faster than boosting
[4:12:07] SilkeySmooth: did classic servers crash after launch?
[4:12:12] yshtola1337: im gonna level the draenei warrior first tyhen blood elf paladin
[4:12:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: many times

[4:13:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: im glad im on the big group must mean my server will have it easy in TBC
[4:13:45] Jessethoth: I think there'll be a wave of Classic players who skipped out on the streamer servers.
[4:13:47] NovaSun84: Westfall and Pagle coming together FeelsGoodMan
[4:13:48] Dirtnose: I assume its like retail where it says name-server

[4:23:08] MetaKuron: Anything in shop?
[4:23:12] Feldemort_vn: Good enough to do some end game content?
[4:23:16] QQisLIVE: It was only 40mb when I installed
[4:23:16] TheOGMed: it updated fast
[4:23:19] ClassicMalcontent: It did. Mine did too. A lot need to reload.

[4:23:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: ptr files are shared with live so I already had most of it
[4:23:41] gidgeet: But Fiber is even better lol
[4:23:44] ClassicMalcontent: I'm only at 200Mbps (lowest tier in the area) options for 500 or Gigabit+
[4:23:46] Hazno: it was probably a bigger update for anyone that didn't preload it in the background
[4:23:47] dcmaniac11: Is the dark portal open today or is that not until actual launch?
[4:23:48] neverbornlucky: MrGM is on the same screens we are no surprises yet for Towelliee

[4:24:35] 91Niki: I don't question it
[4:24:47] MetaKuron: People farming netherweave in deadwind pass
[4:24:49] Skara_XD: My internet says its 200/200 but sometimes i download at like 250-350ish

[4:24:51] Malarick: me working from home and 3 kids on zoom classes.  perfect
[4:24:52] ochiero_amarru: what is your internet provider
[4:24:54] MrSnekyDino: there's a new "Shop World of Warcraft Classic" button in the TBC launcher page. Goes to a error currently, but seems like they'll have a new store page just for Classic.
[4:24:55] dracullus: @Towelliee I wonder how many people think transfering to TBC cost money
[4:24:56] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah they just upgraded me from 50 mbps to 500 mbps for 10 a month
[4:24:59] gingerbasterd: I have gig and I pay $45 a month LOL
[4:25:03] ClassicMalcontent: My 200 Mbps / 20 Mbps up has been fine for what we use it for.

[4:25:22] Chiphazzord: i have had gb for years at 80 a month
[4:25:22] CritcobainTV: Bro internet where i live is dog shit. It's $140 from comcast for 250 download @Towelliee
[4:25:25] Nico_vdM: We currently have 50/50 for R700 a month, we can go up to 1000/1000 for R1200 a month.  Unforch that is too much atm
[4:25:25] TheOGMed: yeah spectrum can't offer gigabyte in my area. So thank god we are moving next month!
[4:25:26] khrownoes: i have 90 gold
[4:25:31] Lesrek: gold is so stupid easy to make in TBC that farming it now feels too tedious
[4:25:33] Stars_Eternall: i cant even hit 20 mbs here in england ;-;
[4:25:33] TheCasualDad84: I have 90 down and 45 up and it’s plenty for what I do.
[4:25:33] GameWithDerp: it really isn't
[4:25:33] ClassicMalcontent: $34.99 / month for 200-down/20-up Wowway ISP
[4:25:35] MrGattz: tell that to spectrum
[4:25:38] denflup: doge to the moon?
[4:25:43] mmrghost7: is the download out ?
[4:25:43] Sonatta: give me space internet PogChamp
[4:25:44] MrGattz: they give ZERO shits about you or anyone else
[4:25:47] NovaSun84: canada still painfully behind the curve
[4:25:50] GameWithDerp: its only good in very very very limited areas, other than that its a fucking scam
[4:25:51] TheOGMed: true story
[4:25:51] Hazno: my apartment building has 500/500 by default, and like $20 to upgrade to gigabit LUL
[4:25:52] FosSiLiTate: i dream of the day Comcast declares bankruptcy
[4:25:52] MrGattz: yeah.. yeah ik they are..
[4:25:54] Xailen: internet is getting cheaper? never heard of it
[4:25:57] MrGattz: i know allll about it..
[4:25:57] Chiphazzord: comcast gb here is 80 for gb
[4:25:58] pandag96: wait so we can level belfs today?
[4:25:58] ochiero_amarru: tell that to comcast
[4:26:01] CritcobainTV: Spectrum is just as bad as comcast KEKW
[4:26:01] OneNetGaming: The 5G
[4:26:04] OneNetGaming: Lol
[4:26:14] Feldemort_vn: They need to make unlimited free
[4:26:15] 91Niki: If Gattz don't tell me how garbage spectrum is at least once a day, i start to worry
[4:26:15] Sonatta: i'm ready for space internet... those people that blocked google fiber ruined everything
[4:26:19] TheCasualDad84: German internet blows
[4:26:21] Feldemort_vn: That 1tb cap is dumb
[4:26:40] ClassicMalcontent: wowway com is now $29.99 / month for 200 Mbps nice
[4:26:41] GameWithDerp: literally all the numbers all of you are quoting are still waaaay to much for what should be offered at this stage of the game -- usa falling way behind in network infrastructure
[4:26:52] Jessethoth: I said when Shadowlands came out, I feel like they might be planning a .4 or maybe even the first .5 for an expansion.
[4:27:00] FruckAwesome: they plan do fully open Washington State by end of June
[4:27:00] OneNetGaming: Does Druid feral benefit from weapon dps in bc
[4:27:09] Ldysansa: That would be great
[4:27:12] FruckAwesome: and allow full capacity for sports for vaccinated people
[4:27:14] BTiZZY_: why wouldn’t they do blizzcon??
[4:27:14] Jessethoth: Inb4 3 year expansion KEKW
[4:27:22] Hazno: they could require vaccine confirmation to enter blizzcon
[4:27:30] denflup: do you think 9.2 will be last shadowlands patch? if 9.3 exists, next expac would be sooooo late
[4:27:31] Chiphazzord: if you want cheaper internet buy your own router and modem.. stop paying to much for renting
[4:27:31] pragmas76: Legion was announced off Blizzcon, so they don't HAVE to announce it there.
[4:27:32] MackPlays: Press only blizzcon
[4:27:33] Nico_vdM: Blizzcon this year could be a D4 and 9.2/3 reveal
[4:27:39] 3663Sharad: Small Blizzcon cloud result in a "Influencer-Party", amybe?
[4:27:41] 3663Sharad: *maybe
[4:27:51] SteelEm: they either do vacc card or 48 hour covid test
[4:27:53] othraerir: not in australia lol
[4:27:57] GameWithDerp: really depends on what state
[4:27:58] TheOGMed: I got my Covid passport lol
[4:28:00] FruckAwesome: I think we will forever see the events online, with maybe smaller in person
[4:28:01] dracullus: @Towelliee they don't really have stuff to show this year, last one was saved by remasters
[4:28:01] MrSnekyDino: @Towelliee There's a new "Shop World of Warcraft Classic" button on the TBC launcher page. Goes to a error currently, but seems like they'll have a new store page just for Classic instead of sharing the store with Live.
[4:28:02] 91Niki: You got the soldier serum HYPERS
[4:28:03] Feydens: that would be a hippa violation
[4:28:03] spainard15: No I think supreme cout shot that down
[4:28:03] othraerir: can't even get a shot
[4:28:04] Sonatta: if they just prepare for Blizzcon Online like they do a normal live Blizzcon presentation... the stream won't be shit
[4:28:07] Hazno: @othraerir Australia handled that shit waaaay better than the US LUL
[4:28:09] plumpus81: got my second shot 4 hours ago - feeling fine so far
[4:28:13] FruckAwesome: companies save sooooo much money just doing online conferences
[4:28:16] Jessethoth: Everquest did a "maintenance expansion" that kind of went back through the entire game real hard from what I understand, maybe they'll do that for WoW.
[4:28:16] GameWithDerp: supreme court definately didn't shoot that down
[4:28:27] plumpus81: work gave me tomorrow off to recover in case i get sick - will use it to play video games
[4:28:36] spainard15: Well it is a HIPPA Violation
[4:28:38] Twigz_KC: @charlchik I was fine the day of my 2nd shot, the next day had a 100 deg fever all day
[4:28:40] GameWithDerp: not at all
[4:28:41] Shallo1988: Got my first shot today FutureMan
[4:28:43] spainard15: yes
[4:28:43] denflup: YEP, 9.3 cancelled for sure
[4:28:50] MistaHat: youre right 100%
[4:28:50] slothlovechunk11: blizzcon without X-pack announcement LUL
[4:28:53] 3663Sharad: 9.2 infos, wit a sneak peak into 10.0
[4:28:58] GameWithDerp: screaming everything is hippa violation doesn't make it hippa violation mate
[4:29:04] Jessethoth: If they do that 2 patch shit again I'm done, WoD pissed me right the fuck off until 7.3.
[4:29:05] Garrujak: Good, so instead of making SL good, we'll have TWO shitty expansions. Yipee!
[4:29:05] FruckAwesome: Im doubting a 9.1 at this point hehe
[4:29:07] NanotronRofl: Didn't Ion said they weren't going to pull off an WoD 2.0 by skipping a patch the preach interview?
[4:29:07] denflup: shadowlands 2.5 years
[4:29:07] Alllprimer: @Shallo1988 SeemsGood
[4:29:08] Ahunamongus: imagine comparing 25million population nation to 325million
[4:29:08] Tyrsfal: Are u sure thats realistic tho dude??
[4:29:09] pragmas76: "Draenor is free"-style ending confirmed then

[4:29:12] giochidasballo: my preferite game
[4:29:13] cruzeal: the maw 🤢
[4:29:15] Eraste: that would truly be hell LUL
[4:29:16] plumpus81: @Twigz_KC as long as I can make it through today - hopefully it's not too bad, but I can game while I'm sick :-D
[4:29:17] PvtHudson093: pls no
[4:29:17] Sonatta: if there's a 9.3 i'll be worried about 10.0
[4:29:20] Ldysansa: That kinda sad... Shadowlands could have been so great
[4:29:21] Jessethoth: They said something about a Titan homeworld...so we could see a .4.
[4:29:35] Jessethoth: Slands had a fuckload of potential.
[4:29:45] GameWithDerp: dumb is dumb I guess
[4:29:56] Holdtoskip: my launcher jsut switched to bc classic hehe
[4:29:57] Chiphazzord: if we only get 9.2 this really is wod 2.0
[4:29:59] neverbornlucky: MrGm stopped streaming so no TBC soon
[4:30:01] QQisLIVE: 9.2 confirmed Tier sets?
[4:30:07] Wulfgrym: @MrGattz how do i get hooked up to the guild discord again, i removed discord from my pc last month?
[4:30:09] Lexi__Marie: i mean im gonna play regardless so if 9.3 has story that relates to shadowlands then so what if its extended
[4:30:11] Jessethoth: That makes sense,
[4:30:11] Eraste: ugh, they're going to throw so much story at us and it'll probably be pretty BFA bad
[4:30:11] happybooger: but he also said that they had more planned for after 9.2
[4:30:12] dracullus: suuuuuure
[4:30:13] MrSnekyDino: HIPAA is solely preventing a healthcare provider from sharing confidential health and insurance information without patient consent. You can't violate HIPAA, a Disneyland park attendant cannot violate HIPAA - JUST a healthcare provider.
[4:30:13] spainard15: My wife is a Director of a hospital and trust me it is
[4:30:16] Jessethoth: Spillover story, I could see that.
[4:30:31] mavericks312: I think jailer spans 2 xpacs sorta like guldan
[4:30:32] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym DM Gattz in discord
[4:30:36] Chiphazzord: nice humble brag there
[4:30:38] MistaHat: theyll just rack it up to covid and come out with 9.2
[4:30:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: he stopped so he could come tell you to do something LUL
[4:30:39] Breeni: This is the normal time MrGM ends
[4:30:40] stemss: 3PM PST??
[4:30:44] Sonatta: they don't farm like Towelliee... hence why Asmon always loses mount offs now
[4:30:47] spainard15: Disney can not demand to see a health record of any form
[4:30:49] PandaTV: im going to sleep in a sec im tired lol
[4:30:50] GameWithDerp: my friend is a friend and has a left leg and he says you are french
[4:30:50] denflup: maybe we get 9.2.5 who knows
[4:30:51] FruckAwesome: "Want streamer endurance? buy these pills!"
[4:30:58] MrGattz: @Wulfgrym yeah just dm me on discord
[4:30:59] EthicalHermit: Would you care if it was a .3 or 10.0, as long as it had new area/systems?
[4:31:01] Wulfgrym: @91Niki ill try it again
[4:31:06] 91Niki: @PandaTV towHi
[4:31:12] PandaTV: towHi
[4:31:16] Rexialiton: @PandaTV Sleep tight mate
[4:31:16] MrGattz: @PandaTV sacWAVE cohhL
[4:31:26] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym I'll yell at him if he doesn't get back to you, dw SeemsGood
[4:31:27] Clover__North: I'm cool with a 9.3 and 10.0 merge if we get a 3 boss raid in 9.2.5 or something
[4:31:33] Wulfgrym: @MrGattz sent you a friend request in discord won't let me send you a msg
[4:31:34] lordmyer: is the tier sets going to be through vendors or drops in 9.2 @Towelliee
[4:31:37] Cidarr: why not just play alliance? Kappa
[4:31:38] Jessethoth: @EthicalHermit I wouldn't, I'd be happy with an Argus sized patch and a new Titan world to explore.
[4:31:39] Mr_Arms: I am ready to grind
[4:31:41] VoidAbyssTV: i need to get my pally to 60 as well
[4:31:44] Garrujak: I still have no idea what character to boost. Either Shammy to heal or Warrior to tank. Got no clue
[4:31:45] Skara_XD: @PandaTV thought you were spending time with nat lol wasnt expecting to see you
[4:31:51] MrSnekyDino: Your DOCTOR cannot share information without your consent to Disney. Disney can ABSOLUTELY request that information from YOU. YOU can deny to give them that, and they can then deny your entrance to the park. NONE of that violates HIPAA.
[4:32:01] Jessethoth: @EthicalHermit It'd be even better if our Covenant shit didn't work on that planet.
[4:32:12] PandaTV: I am ready to level the warlock i xfered over my warrior so i got like 2500 gold and some bags lol
[4:32:13] TombStoneMercenary: Cries as a 45 pally
[4:32:23] EthicalHermit: @Jessethoth Same, I don't care what its called, just want more content
[4:32:29] Wulfgrym: @91Niki i sent him a friend request my dm wouldn't go through
[4:32:30] neverbornlucky: so make Blood Elf frost mage instead
[4:32:41] PvtHudson093: Human Paladins get the cool weapon racials
[4:32:43] TombStoneMercenary: Pagle is going to be oof!

[4:32:54] Mr_Arms: So you are leveling till 20 then boosting? Or questing the most of the way there
[4:32:54] GameWithDerp: Like, honestly, how hard is it to just google what is actually a hippa violation instead of just pertending everything is a violation
[4:32:58] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Can't dm people unless you share server. Usually
[4:32:59] gidgeet: Blood Elf Hunter for the win!
[4:33:00] Wulfgrym: @91Niki nope i have to rejoin that one too

[4:33:49] stemss: shit im on whitemane lol
[4:34:03] wolfjc_69: Keep up the great work. Love the stream and can't wait for pay day to buy the game.
[4:34:03] Sonatta: @xhaven your classic should have been converted to BC
[4:34:05] Chiraakitteh: @xhaven They did that for you automatically
[4:34:05] Hazno: @xhaven classic automatically got updated to tbc, you have to manually reinstall classic now
[4:34:09] Mr_Arms: U guys on Azuresong are lucky ur gonna have no queues LUL
[4:34:11] neverbornlucky: PChild Got stuck on whiteman too

[4:34:48] Jessethoth: I can't wait to play it without certain streamer communities.

[4:56:56] Juralor: When do character boosts for BCC open?
[4:56:57] SonofHorus82: is the Warpstalker going to be on all of our current toons? Or just our most recent login?

[5:07:27] Biorrwolf: So question: Should I still push to get my hunter, currently 24, to 60 during pre-patch to aid my Pally, or just start my pally now? Hunter is Skinning/ Chant, Pally will be Engi/Mining
[5:07:28] jheadrick: He knows!

[5:08:22] paddingwow: Try logging in?
[5:08:23] Whytepap3r: They need to add the controversial MTX *after* we're attached to our characters with dozens of hours played.

[5:08:31] nihilist74: they didnt let you prepurchase delux?

[5:15:04] Shrapnel_1974: Count downs are good.... Hell i just nuked me a couple of hotdogs... Loved it.

[5:19:32] Sonatta: if the aliens show up with a book called "To Serve Man Kind" gtfo people
[5:19:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe they are returning Elon's car to him?
[5:19:40] ThaOriginalGamester: it's not on AOL
[5:19:41] Collected1: funny how the UFOs are only interested in US air space
[5:19:45] Wildside1177: The chance that alien life has visited us is about 1.0 x 10^-50 or so.
[5:19:46] toobaked1987: Elon is the 2nd richest person in the world that loves shooting off rockets while have Aspergers. Of course he is a little off.
[5:19:54] DelcoAF: @ThaOriginalGamester hahaha

[5:21:36] Sonatta: that's the real truth @Garrujak FeelsBadMan
[5:21:37] Armdel: the question isn't if there are aliens, its if they are advanced enough in technology to travel space
[5:21:41] bruhSit_farmer: i want to screw a thic alien mami
[5:21:45] Asyia3: wow is lifting the dungeon cap
[5:21:46] falldrgn: @biirrd There have been reports of this all over world for years... The existence of star people etc...is well documented in history
[5:21:46] DrakhanGaming: @biirrd maybe because america has the most "traffic"
[5:21:48] Ooogachukka: i def believe there is other life out there- I just dont think its in OUR solar system
[5:21:48] Wulfgrym: @DeadlyDag nope, he was pretty sure it was aliens, watching them, he was stationed at a nuclear launch site.

[5:21:53] mavericks312: wowhead just reported the daily dungeon limit has been lifted
[5:21:55] neverbornlucky: Towelliee if a Alien is proven to be real does that make it a illegal Alien ?
[5:21:58] Shrapnel_1974: All this Aliens talk makes me want to watch Mars Attacks.
[5:21:59] Rexialiton: Scary thought i feel
[5:22:06] RPClipsGTA: aliens cant violate the prime directive
[5:22:07] Asyia3: https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1394701361585868808
[5:22:07] Juralor: What's your estimated viewer count at BCC release?
[5:22:10] Mygdrayl: @Towelliee its seems yes
[5:22:12] ClassicMalcontent: No they did not.
[5:22:13] MrSnekyDino: infinite
[5:22:14] DelcoAF: that I agree with, but if they are so far advanced why would they come here? It's like you trying to communicate with an ant.
[5:22:15] Funderik: no  daily limit
[5:22:18] krytsi: no limit
[5:22:20] ClassicMalcontent: Just now?
[5:22:23] trinita289: @Towelliee will be there a marathon when tbc releases ?
[5:22:25] MrSnekyDino: Check Wowhead
[5:22:29] DeadlyDag: @biirrd Assuming you mean alien crafts, and not UFOs. UFOs are sighted daily in all over EU as well. We just assume it's something that's not alien :p
[5:22:32] Waspire: For pre-patch and the initial leveling in Outland, we're lifting the cap on how many dungeons a Burning Crusade Classic character can enter every 24 hours: twitter!!

[5:22:39] Ooogachukka: curiousity + research
[5:22:43] neverbornlucky: If the Government doesn't Kill us Aliens will just smoke more weed all will be ok
[5:22:46] ClassicMalcontent: For PRE-PATCH
[5:22:53] ClassicMalcontent: No word on post-PrePatch
[5:22:54] Armdel: no sire denathrius nerfs yet?
[5:22:56] Arocian: hahahaha
[5:23:01] Sonatta: they want those bot subs
[5:23:06] ClassicMalcontent: For PREPATCH we'll see if they leave that for launch
[5:23:10] mrheimz: PogChamp bots
[5:23:11] MrSnekyDino: Don't forget the trusty: /console nameplateMaxDistance 41
[5:23:20] all_beef_franks: they are having the Bilderberg meeting for bots right now to plan something
[5:23:23] Athaka: Its not about the bots, its about the players wanting to nolife pala/shaman and TBC launch 100%
[5:23:23] DrakhanGaming: nerfing sire denathrius wont make blizzard any money, tbc is their only focus
[5:23:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee Lego Infinity Gauntlet easy buy https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1394702059690074112?s=20

[5:24:14] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:24:16] neverbornlucky: GoBots were the Kmart brand of Transformers
[5:24:19] lordmyer: what does no limit mean can someone explain?
[5:24:21] Athaka: Yes there is @ClassicMalcontent It says for ALL tbc realms, so with prepatch and onwards they will remove daily dungeon cap
[5:24:22] piratechris: They will be selling tickets to the Area 51 show soon
[5:24:28] JonnyFivesAlive: they got rid of the dungeon limit
[5:24:31] JonnyFivesAlive: new blue post
[5:24:33] Eastwicksavag3: you didn't know? there are aliens in Antarctica...thats why we can't go over there or even fly over the airspace
[5:24:35] Aedarax: because karens cant comprehend the existens of other life in the universe
[5:24:37] xluckydawgx: There is two terrifying realities, either we are alone in teh universe, or we are not
[5:24:39] Biorrwolf: Ya gotta keep us subjugated *Offspring style*
[5:24:43] RPClipsGTA: usa has tracking systems that are 100 years ahead of the rest of the world
[5:24:50] ClassicMalcontent: @Athaka specifically says PREPATCH
[5:24:54] henrikjuncker: henrikjuncker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! A pleasure
[5:25:00] DrakhanGaming: a UFO can literally be another countries aircraft that they never told us about, it just means unidentified flying object
[5:25:01] cyclonos: only pre aptch though
[5:25:02] ProClicker: It's not aliens it's time traveling humans
[5:25:03] wraaith: but still 5 per hour right ?
[5:25:07] Waspire: And people said i was crazy  when i reposted a video of a amature  moonpicture  with 4 space craft  moving across it.
[5:25:09] neverbornlucky: if a Alien shows up does a Karen still try to stop it ?
[5:25:12] ClassicMalcontent: @Athaka then they will decide for TBC
[5:25:13] Katzushirou: still 5 per hour?
[5:25:13] Athaka: @ClassicMalcontent Over the next few weeks, the impact of the daily limit is more difficult to know, so we’re going to remove the daily limit on all Burning Crusade realms, effective with the launch of pre-patch.
[5:25:15] MrSnekyDino: They didn't specify hour lockouts
[5:25:24] Karatekaller: do you know if the 58 boost in avaliable with prepatch or with tbc launch?
[5:25:27] Vargg1983: the vaccine microchips are making people see spaceships
[5:25:28] RPClipsGTA: bob from down the street weather balloon project
[5:25:36] yankerzzz: LOL blizzard just released saying they are taking away the 30 dungeon cap completely upon release of pre patch
[5:25:38] Athaka: @ClassicMalcontent As before, we will carefully observe player activity so that we can decide what daily limit, if any, is appropriate to enact after Outland leveling activities have peaked.
[5:25:38] ClassicMalcontent: @Athaka I'm reading it right now. For PrePatch. TBD for TBC.
[5:25:40] lordmyer: I don't feel like that's a big deal them lifting it
[5:25:42] neverbornlucky: Towelliee hasn't watched History Channel SkinWalker Ranch
[5:25:49] Ldysansa: Didn't we always know...I feel our government  just didn't want to acknowledge aliens existed
[5:25:52] Aidler: oddly the aliens in reality look like moonkins naguuraThinking
[5:25:58] Athaka: Notice the "After" @ClassicMalcontent
[5:26:02] stallowned: u should checkout bob lazar if u are into ufo shit towTinfoil
[5:26:03] skymercii: @Vargg1983 theres no micriochips in the damn vaccine
[5:26:09] RPClipsGTA: they will most likely look similar to us
[5:26:15] ClassicMalcontent: @Athaka There you go. Yes. After Prepatch. Before TBC they will decide.
[5:26:17] Wulfgrym: this explains why Elon wants to pump doge, his alien race needs a new currency system
[5:26:21] Miguel85NYC: you guys think they will add a Mount tab in  TBC? I really hope they do
[5:26:28] Aidler: no really they look like moonkins naguuraSmart
[5:26:29] kuazi1: No, there are 5G antennas in the vacs, not chips
[5:26:33] Athaka: NO, it says After leveling activities have peaked
[5:26:39] Havykk: arent they removing the cap so people can level? isnt that good?
[5:26:44] Shrapnel_1974: So this for Chat... Will our add-ons work on Pre-Patch TBC?

[5:35:29] Dkgungo: i saw a ufo like 15 years ago now saw this weird craft hovering then in just vanished into thin air

[5:54:18] Shallo1988: just give them their own category and have it as like an onlyfans
[5:54:21] Broomba: Twitch is removing monetary incentives on twitch? That’s what i am getting.

[6:25:07] Tarfu: I can't even find where to buy the boost for TBC

[6:26:29] denflup: F

[6:33:18] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee underrates factor in leveling time that no one is considering is that most hybrids have greatly reduced kill times. makes leveling much faster.
[6:33:20] Dragoncaller: i bet towelliee can get a carry in Naxx or AQ40, if i was on server probably would do it.
[6:33:21] Doedje: it's pretty fast, ungoro and silithus are very nice for leveling

[6:46:33] Garrujak: Also: don't buy a boost on a secondary wow account if you want to xfer it, since you can't xfer it to an account
[6:46:38] Douggi3: @Towelliee Did you have the name Towelliee before The South Park Character?
[6:46:41] Skylin3r: it will probebly just change to deluxe upgrade to ppl that got the boost

[7:07:29] happybooger: bring on the mobile games
[7:07:30] Skylin3r: how would you innovate RTS?
[7:07:30] Sonatta: Small Indie games
[7:07:46] solus_one: AOC has a small staff
[7:07:53] HeBeDead: is the question about innovating rts?
[7:07:58] Juralor: I don't think they'd do RTS since they know it would be compared to SC and Warcraft

[7:08:49] sultan_of_sauce91: it was good
[7:08:51] raymond3195: aoc will be dead in a year and ppl will lose there money
[7:08:55] Mosoner: Was it true AOC this past weekend was a dumpster fire for their servers? I heard that lol
[7:09:27] bruhSit_farmer: would a riot mmo be pure e-sport centric stuff or alot of exploration/casual stuff too ?
[7:09:27] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:09:37] Shrenko: Steven took some shots against New World devs on Discord too
[7:09:39] Mosoner: Wow damn, gotcha boss
[7:09:43] HeBeDead: hpala in burning is viable, have fun with it
[7:09:46] Spikeyshadow: yo the lighting the shelves behind you look sick @Towelliee
[7:09:53] Sonatta: even with Riot's money and man power i question whether ANY developer can release a MMO with enough leveling content, end game, and release new content at a pace that would keep MMO players happy
[7:09:55] solus_one: I tested it as well this past weekend and I can say without a doubt, they need a lot more work
[7:10:01] Skylin3r: that's the problem with this pay to test shit
[7:10:08] papaPathos: The initial testing was a complete dumpster fire, so bad they called it off after 2 of supposed 4 days of testing. this time around, it WAS an improvement, but still absolutely untenable to start worrying about content.
[7:10:10] Ravencro: how is ti going towel? like your new room
[7:10:12] Juralor: Pretty much any healer is viable in TBC. Disc is just bad for pve
[7:10:13] xRykku: @Towelliee what did you think of FF14s FanFest this past weekend?
[7:10:22] Skylin3r: you need ppl to test it, but you're chargin money

[7:10:29] ha_xd: Do you still have your addon package for a pally hammers up?
[7:10:30] raymond3195: riot don't need the hasle of mmo
[7:10:34] Shrapnel_1974: towBeer
[7:10:38] Shrenko: they need atleast 4+ more years to release AoC
[7:10:53] HeBeDead: sounds like aoc is doomed

[7:11:08] solus_one: AOC is not doomed, just needs more work
[7:11:10] vimie: AOC just screams no confidence on their product
[7:11:12] papaPathos: gotcha, Towel. But people were already spilling the tea left and right about how much of a dumpster fire this pre-alpha status is. that steven dude basically had no chance but let people talk about it.
[7:11:16] Mosoner: I just hope they aren’t rushing AOC like crazy
[7:11:30] Sonatta: people are expecting too much from AoC and don't realize it's another 3-4 years from a real release
[7:11:35] HeBeDead: i mean funding wise, sounds like they wont have theh money long term, but that may be a wild guess
[7:11:36] jimmix12: is Riot doing a mmo ?
[7:11:42] xXSiebzehnXx: Maybe they did it to try to do damage control
[7:11:46] bruhSit_farmer: im down for the riot mmo but i hope it isnt purely instanced e-sport like content
[7:11:47] froodyo: Riot is for sure doing an MMO
[7:11:54] Sniped23: And adding for classic will all be broken?
[7:11:58] froodyo: it will be really far along by the time they announce it
[7:11:58] Aravarth: I mean, I'm looking forward to Riot's MMO
[7:11:59] Sniped23: Addons
[7:11:59] xXSiebzehnXx: At this point they know people are gonna shit in it
[7:12:00] Aravarth: just as a change of pace
[7:12:03] xXSiebzehnXx: On
[7:12:12] Mosoner: @sonatta people just really want the next great mmo experience to make them feel how they did with EQ and WoW
[7:12:37] GermanBacon: if you have to say "its not THAT bad" its straight grabagio KEKW
[7:12:44] StarbuckTech: has there ever been a good alpha?
[7:12:48] GermanBacon: *garbage
[7:12:54] solus_one: @Towelliee  is 100% correct lol
[7:12:56] AvoidtheHat: And espacially their first game
[7:12:59] Sonatta: @Mosoner until we get VR immersive mmo gameplay there won't be a another MMO like that
[7:13:00] Shrenko: I agree with this post https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/nexat3/this_game_is_not_ready_to_be_viewed_by_the_public/ @Towelliee
[7:13:09] lordmyer: How many years till the beta for AOC comes out? @Towelliee
[7:13:14] ElPolloBatman: who is steven?
[7:13:34] bruhSit_farmer: new world looks pretty dope to me honestly, cool aesthetic
[7:13:34] sprert: you only get to have one first impression - someone, somewhere

[7:24:31] froodyo: agreed
[7:24:36] froodyo: d2 will stream better
[7:24:42] Shrenko: @GermanBacon same with TBC. Nostalgia
[7:24:43] StarbuckTech: brb need another IPA
[7:24:45] CaptainJoeyNY: AoC is Age of Conan..... I feel like a boomer
[7:24:49] SilkeySmooth: same here i played it and beat it back then im ready for d4
[7:24:59] froodyo: @CaptainJoeyNY Ashes of Creation
[7:25:00] Shrenko: @GermanBacon I havent played D2 before but Im pretty excited for it anyway. it looks good!
[7:25:15] CaptainJoeyNY: I know I know
[7:25:29] Draeuzen: I'm confused. What is the pre-patch for Wow Classic servers or The Burning Crusade Classic? I can download both atm.
[7:25:32] cyllos: I bought age of conan :(
[7:25:33] Sniped23: #waitingforprepatch
[7:25:34] CaptainJoeyNY: To this day, the first 20 levels of AOC was the best MMO experience.
[7:25:39] MOLAR305: age of conan was relaly graphic intensive
[7:25:41] Scaryrobots: conan was fun
[7:25:41] CaptainJoeyNY: dunno about you, shit ran fine on my rig
[7:25:51] kokochris: Ya that Dev screwed up Conan IP twice
[7:26:02] DeadlyDag: @cyllos still got my collector's edition here on my shelf together with all WoW CEs and ESO CE :p
[7:26:04] belfastcl: I remember nightmares asylum quit wow to play age of conan LUL
[7:26:06] Hazno: graphically it looked nice, but it was a busted game once you got past the starting areas
[7:26:07] CaptainJoeyNY: it failed cause it literally didnt have quets from level 50-80
[7:26:10] zx10rx: AoC was a really solid game and the classes in it were so unique and well done
[7:26:16] papaPathos: Age of Conan was also pretty much the earliest game that had some kind of action combat. it was A BLAST. I loved it. played it back when eidos published it.
[7:26:24] RetroHACK: Age of conan was great in the starter zone, and then you went into the desert and nothing left
[7:26:25] BluSnep: did you play wildstar when that came out?
[7:26:25] CaptainJoeyNY: there were XP gaps where you had to grind dungeons for 10 levels at a time
[7:26:30] Brodih_: AoC was amazing, also with that combo system
[7:26:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[7:26:46] desmo7: and the fart sounds
[7:26:48] OhnoezUK: should do a failed mmo tier list
[7:26:55] Hazno: @Towelliee you could complete every quest and you still had to grind mobs to level up to be eligible for new quests/areas later on in Age of Conan
[7:27:05] Dkgungo: who remembers aion?
[7:27:05] GermanBacon: sadly true KEKW
[7:27:06] loki2k20: you  need or needed to get laid
[7:27:08] mikejames01: wildstar

[7:27:24] zx10rx: FF14, ESO are still around, they are decent gme
[7:27:26] froodyo: most hyped faliures
[7:27:27] ghostboy_____: TBC loading screen is awfully laggy.... or is it just me?
[7:27:28] gazaway: Wildstar
[7:27:28] jacooners: ff14 is not failing
[7:27:28] Sniped23: ESO is graphically amazing bro I see people playing it on PC it blows my mind.
[7:27:28] Cidarr: secret world on top obviously, the atmosphere and story in that game will never be topped
[7:27:34] PawgersHC: Rift

[7:27:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: Sims Online KEKW
[7:27:37] pawgmoth: Wildstar was the most popular MMO that failed the most spectacularly
[7:27:38] Daveybutter: Vanguard: Saga of Heroes
[7:27:39] Aravarth: Oh man, speaking of MMOs that aren't around anymore, I *really* missed playing "Earth and Beyond"
[7:27:39] RetroHACK: Firefall has to be near the top of that list
[7:27:40] CaptainJoeyNY: wildstar is the best worst MMO
[7:27:41] mynameisjonas79: Wildstar
[7:27:42] saltychickenbiscuit: Wildstar was fucking great
[7:27:46] Hazno: "the ones you didn't want to go" list
[7:27:47] MrSnekyDino: Does Star Wars Galaxies after the update that ruined it make S-Tier?
[7:27:47] CrunkyBrewster: ESO is an amazing miracle considering how trash it was on release
[7:27:47] dalaraz: bless online easy bottom @Towelliee
[7:27:48] Vandoran01: wildstar is the only game aside from FF id go back to

[7:28:18] MrSnekyDino: @Zadentv Damn I wanted to play that game so badly
[7:28:19] Mosoner: Warhammer I played and Age of Conan I played, both failures lol
[7:28:20] ilildan1369: اه
[7:28:20] mynameisjonas79: Archeage = A/B
[7:28:21] loki2k20: i want to play some god damn prepatch greatness. damn you blizzard
[7:28:21] moonscryer: Secret World for most creative story / atmosphere and skill wheel that died hard.
[7:28:24] Daveybutter: @towelliee SWG pre NGE was the GOAT
[7:28:25] Mekkols: Wildstar with tuned down endgame would be great
[7:28:25] pawgmoth: EverQuest II was mostly a failure compared to the original
[7:28:26] Skylin3r: i miss marvel heroes

[7:28:31] MrSnekyDino: Never was able to launch Warhammer online on my computer sadly
[7:28:32] CrunkyBrewster: Vanguard
[7:28:32] Dkgungo: it did not fail but did not live up to its potential
[7:28:34] cineris_3: with the amount of money EA put into it, it may be a failure
[7:28:34] zx10rx: I cannot stand wow retail but ill sure enjoy BC
[7:28:34] mikejames01: swtor is not a fail
[7:28:35] Kinghorn: I miss my warrior priest in warhammer online
[7:28:39] raldrik: Star Wars Galaxies, Ascherons call 2
[7:28:44] Juralor: I've played majority of MMOs since the huge wave in mid 2000s
[7:28:48] Zadentv: @Towelliee did you ever try warhammer online when it was out?
[7:28:50] Juralor: All end up flopping
[7:28:50] SilkeySmooth: city of heros!!!!!!!!!
[7:28:53] mystyfan: Swtor has the best character agency, too bad the end game was crap when it first came out at least
[7:29:02] MOLAR305: it was the most complete at launch
[7:29:04] metavahn231: ffxiv was allowed to be saved, catering to hardcore players is just so bad that their is no coming back from it
[7:29:04] dracullus: @Towelliee and it was during WoD
[7:29:12] cahoots82: I miss Wildstar so much. Such a good fucking game.
[7:29:13] Brodih_: it failed because it was too hardcore right ?
[7:29:15] Aravarth: Nod, storylines on SWTOR were great, kinda sad the way it went
[7:29:15] Lykouralis_Trav: Aion was fun in the begining, later the kinah bots make low lvl get grief
[7:29:16] Hazno: combat was so fun in WildStar as well
[7:29:18] kharnij83: there's a big difference from failure to disappointing. SWTOR was a disappointment @towelliee
[7:29:19] dalaraz: you prolly nver played bless online :p
[7:29:20] OhnoezUK: never played wildstar, what was the failure
[7:29:26] Juralor: One of the only decent MMOs I've played during WoW's lifetime was Aeon (Guild Wars creators)
[7:29:27] Hazno: I miss my Esper
[7:29:30] metavahn231: and it was completely justified that it died LUL
[7:29:31] Tultham: Wildstar just came out at the wrong time
[7:29:34] MrSnekyDino: What killed Wildstar?
[7:29:41] GermanBacon: because the devs didnt make a game for modern times but a game they wanted.
[7:29:44] KiLLERJA0: Original FF14 was worse then wildstar
[7:29:49] gazaway: Wildstar was too difficult for the casual mass
[7:29:50] valth: some of the best adds to
[7:29:52] cahoots82: @MrSnekyDino A great big shitstorm of everything you could do wrong
[7:29:57] A_Klimas: it was also held together with bubblegum
[7:29:58] bagrain: wildstar was so good to
[7:29:59] NexxusWoW: Why did it die?
[7:30:04] Vandoran01: when did it come out in wows life cycle? wod?
[7:30:04] HexaDroid: they should have made wildstar casual and add hardcore later. I miss that game so much, housing was so good too
[7:30:08] SilkeySmooth: they should do a classic widlstar
[7:30:09] Hazno: people complained about WoW getting to easy, free epics etc.. WildStar launched with a lot of hardcore content, didn't get the traction it needed to survive with how hardcore it was
[7:30:18] Juralor: Wildstar came out during Cata
[7:30:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: wow twitter just posted a poll on what we are gonna go first in prepatch

[7:31:17] stallowned: i loved the wildstar housing, it was fun
[7:31:20] hurn_: @towelliee  I miss SWG
[7:31:21] Juralor: I wish I played more Wildstar than just the beta

[7:32:24] Hazno: people complained about WoW getting too easy with "free epics" in WotLK, WildStar launched as a more hardcore MMO, and people didn't want that either LUL
[7:32:24] metavahn231: rift was silky smooth
[7:32:24] Haengelmann: FFXIV 1.0 Kappa

[7:32:29] Biorrwolf: We still talking about Aliens?

[7:32:44] probablyrandall: my guilty pleasure mmo will always be aion before it went f2p
[7:32:52] Alacod: They tried to be wow classic in an era where the mmo market was saturated
[7:32:58] Chuckforfun: We did ;D
[7:33:00] Lith0n: @Towelliee what upcoming MMO are you looking forward to most?
[7:33:12] Aravarth: That's what makes WoW so great. It meets the needs of such a broad range of people -- filthy casuals, hardcore gamers, esports types, people who like Pokemon Go, etc.
[7:33:17] dutchie76: Pantheon Kappa
[7:33:19] Nazz_1138: those dungeons were hard to gold star too
[7:33:19] DoubleNova: I really enjoyed Rift

[7:35:29] Kinghorn: I tuned in after the FFXIV stuff, looked interesting
[7:35:29] HexaDroid: more yachts for bezos

[9:30:16] Wickerman406: I wish we could play classic in the meantime. 😔
[9:30:16] geinitlaldy: shaving off a leveling day, how many level boosts does that sell?
[9:30:22] Chiphazzord: ooof i wanna level now not at 6
[9:30:23] Katosama: EU maintenance starts at 01:00 AM , its 11:21 PM atm. it will go untill 9:00 AM

[9:30:45] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[9:30:50] Hazno: @Wickerman406 everything you did in that time window would've been wasted though, they have to do the character snapshots some time
[9:30:50] TheUnknowing: I'm just sad I wont be able to play before retail raid now, rip.
[9:30:51] Damuffin14: What happened?

[9:31:28] skymercii: @Ezekyler oh damn i didnt even realize that
[9:31:29] shimwood: Blizzard was not prepared
[9:31:31] Lycis: I thought they would open midnight EU so 30min
[9:31:31] Eraste: imma get this new paly on retail leveled, campaign finished, and geared out before prepatch danSad
[9:31:33] Crashmobber: at this point Quin will convince Bajheera that he knows more about nutrition before TBC is up
[9:31:34] solus_one: :(
[9:31:35] gooni_coyg: well i am going to bed here in EU... do the dirty testing NA :
[9:31:37] gooni_coyg: :D
[9:31:37] stemss: why this always happen NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[9:31:53] metavahn231: welp time for some extra monsters
[9:32:00] Mike190Twitch: Ya gotta forgive blizzard, they're a Multi Dollar company LUL
[9:32:09] FerociouzMonk: HSWP
[9:32:13] Wulfgrym: we are losing time for sure
[9:32:16] solus_one: yikes
[9:32:17] SonofHorus82: my favorite response to the tweet so far is "I want my money back for the day I cannot play. Extend my subscription by 1 day." like... dafuq dude??
[9:32:21] Chiphazzord: wtb more mages for leveling
[9:32:24] Lycis: oh boy
[9:32:26] bruhSit_farmer: blizz are a small indie company towell give them a break
[9:32:27] Collected1: yup
[9:32:28] TheItalianStallion321: i literally just tweeted that Towel b/c you're right. could be 12 days now
[9:32:29] Crashmobber: @Collected1 im glad someone caught that
[9:32:31] Descina: I didn't cook supper for this damn it, i need my wow time
[9:32:32] EthicalHermit: Ill help level people on my boosted char
[9:32:35] cabalish: remember the server stable test, it was not good
[9:32:35] Collected1: and the annoying thing is they wont extend it
[9:32:36] CuppCake_Gaming: Very real possibility given the stability of their last launches.
[9:32:37] Alkamateria: holy carps, it's impossible to even request vacation days for new releases now
[9:32:39] CapNorge: CapNorge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! I dont expect much playing on June 1 as well...
[9:32:39] tonyr23: service has been extended boys
[9:32:39] Chiphazzord: mages about to make a killing this week
[9:32:41] Kinghorn: HERE WE GO AGAIN
[9:32:42] LucidAntics: Every day my hype to play BC is growing smaller and smaller. this is really rage inducing
[9:32:47] Kinghorn: those people always come out
[9:32:48] BigLoe: Has been extended
[9:32:49] Silentcrits: Think it will be easy to maintain 3-4 alts to casually pug kara and za?
[9:32:49] skymercii: i commented the best gif slootLUL
[9:32:54] Collected1: Crashmobber : i caught about 10 mins of it and checked out. No one is winning that particular argument with Baj. :)
[9:32:56] Masqerader: damn extended till 6pdt
[9:32:58] TombStoneMercenary: At least we do not have to use cd's to load Wow any more
[9:33:00] Hazno: @cabalish server stability tests are always pushing limits though, so that's to be expected
[9:33:09] maccaruso: That twitter post has soooo much salt.
[9:33:17] Descina: halloween years ago, we got a day cause they were shut down
[9:33:17] Orthobullet: 9PM baby LETS GO
[9:33:18] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP
[9:33:19] Dirtnose: Im used to SWTOR which extends literally every patch LUL
[9:33:21] WalknDead: this is like the old days
[9:33:21] Kinghorn: I said it was going the full 8, this is not unexpected
[9:33:23] tuplin: People getting upset don't remember the old days of patch maintenance
[9:33:26] Saakki: When does the pre patch hit in eu? anyone knows?
[9:33:27] PotbellyGoat: I'm finally off work
[9:33:29] svk777: what happens if you dont go outlands on day 1, behind forever?>
[9:33:34] Skylin3r: well, i'm off to bed, good night
[9:33:35] Lycis: ibabyrLucySad ibabyrLucySad ibabyrLucySad
[9:33:39] Hazno: @Saakki maintenance starts in 1.5 hrs,
[9:33:44] xsp00n: if you didn't at least see the possibility of something like this happening, especially when they are implementing such a huge system, then you are dilusional
[9:33:44] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[9:33:45] Scaryrobots: @Towelliee they should give new characters a 50-100% exp increase.
[9:33:46] selling_cure: EU gets prepatch before NA
[9:33:47] FerociouzMonk: unless you are new around here, we knew extended maintenance was gonna happend
[9:33:47] TheItalianStallion321: 12 days
[9:33:51] TheItalianStallion321: by the time you start leveling
[9:33:51] Collected1: if they had given us a four week pre-patch this wouldn't be an issue but oh no. 2 weeks.
[9:33:52] LucidAntics: @tuplin I remember the old days of maintenance, but these arent the old days. that's a bad correlation
[9:33:57] TombStoneMercenary: @tuplin Yup those were the days
[9:34:05] Saakki: @hazno ah ty
[9:34:08] Sincline387: Oh no one less day of prepatch that belfs and space goats didn't get with original TBC anyway
[9:34:09] cabalish: @Hazno yes, but there where barly that much players online compared to real live servers
[9:34:10] KremitTV: realistically, prepatch lenght only concerns casual people who are lvling a spacegoat or redelf. all neckbeards will get there in plenty of time to spare.
[9:34:10] Hehena44: I remember back in the day, every Tuesday was just like a patch day pretty much
[9:34:13] Supers18: shac20 yes delusional cus i expect a company who has been doing this for 16 yrs to get it right
[9:34:17] scelero: imagine if they pushed maintance because they can't get the boost service to work
[9:34:20] volderon1396: Do you think they could possibly push back the release date by 2 weeks?
[9:34:21] Descina: should i go break the news to my husband, he's just as excited as me lol
[9:34:22] Phantomstrk: Are there going to be "fresh" TBC servers June 1, or are the servers that are out now, the only ones that there will be ?
[9:34:22] belaham: according to twitter maintenance has been extended to 6:00pm pdt...F
[9:34:23] Shrenko: Oribos = airport
[9:34:23] metavahn231: i still dont see the post on wow twitter lol
[9:34:23] HeBeDead: maybe they give draeni/blood elfs a small exp boost?
[9:34:28] Arocian: they still don't have the dark portal pass or deluxe edition up for purchase
[9:34:32] Scaryrobots: they need to give exp boosts
[9:34:33] Chiphazzord: hype dropping little by little
[9:34:36] nihilist74: did the original loging screen for tbc look this good as it does now?
[9:34:45] Collected1: Silent1396 : not a chance now they've announced the date and promoted it. sadly.
[9:34:45] Ezekyler: need to farm honor for pvp gear
[9:34:47] Chiphazzord: mine is
[9:34:50] Hazno: @cabalish that's not really relevant, they tune their server numbers to match player count and push the limits to test stability relative to the player count
[9:34:51] TrevorAP: Start my new job Tomorrow, was the last day of all day leveling i had
[9:34:55] Mike190Twitch: People be like "Time to panik!!1111!"
[9:34:56] Paramourn: I know its going to take me a long time to lvl, do any content. I work full time in the ER, so not much time for  gaming sadly
[9:34:58] Skizzurp: they gonna delay NA launch until EU launch to test global launch for retail
[9:35:02] Dirtnose: wow players dramatic af as usual lmao
[9:35:02] metavahn231: oic, 160 hearts doe
[9:35:04] Eraste: drama babies gonna drama
[9:35:04] scelero: 'The sky is falling' - Chicken Little
[9:35:16] Broomba: Everyone needs a chill pill 💊
[9:35:17] selling_cure: 9pm lul
[9:35:18] Wildside1177: A whole 3 hours!!! The sky is falling.
[9:35:18] TheItalianStallion321: 12 days
[9:35:21] Chiphazzord: pull the ripcord blizz the infernal sky is falling
[9:35:22] WalknDead: this is actually normal...(old days)
[9:35:23] Wickerman406: What are you looking forward to the most with TBC?
[9:35:35] Mike190Twitch: Oh I do agree blizz dropped the ball on the patch length
[9:35:40] NinjaGlovz: towLul 13 days now towLul
[9:35:42] HeBeDead: i think blizzard may have dropped the ball in communication, given how much they had to do on the backend
[9:35:43] Descina: i dont mind if they extend launch of TBC truthfully
[9:35:46] Kinghorn: it is being held up by classic server merge shit 100%
[9:35:51] Sincline387: zero right to complain, when they moved SL launch and F'd up a ton of people's pto plans and everyone said "don't complain" everyone loses the right to complain about this
[9:35:54] desmo7: why are they rushing it so much??
[9:35:57] xsp00n: remember the gold old days, when TBC wasnt even playable for the first 2 weeks of the xpac
[9:35:57] AndrewShifuVA: hello there, general Towelliee, nice background color, times have changed
[9:35:59] QQisLIVE: Cause of 9.1
[9:36:01] aminsd1990: 3h more ?will u stream?
[9:36:01] Jynt334: !TBC
[9:36:01] Moobot: @Jynt334 Prepatch is in EXACTLY 33m 4s (assuming nothing goes wrong) || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || TBC launch is on June 1st
[9:36:03] Hazno: @cabalish let's say only half of a typical day at a server was present during the stability test, then they could cut half the resources to the server and keep cutting resources and pushing the limits from there
[9:36:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: lets call it even and let us boost blood elfs Kappa
[9:36:07] Rexdel_: Multi dollar company btw
[9:36:10] TombStoneMercenary: 12 cause TBC launches on a monday
[9:36:10] metavahn231: i need that tabard man
[9:36:10] Chiphazzord: this sounds like quartlery money is due so time to rush
[9:36:11] Dirtnose: @Sincline387 Thats different. Shadowlands needed more dev time. TBC is finished already made content
[9:36:13] WalknDead: it will work out
[9:36:15] CushyPop: 1 week 6 days now
[9:36:17] Mike190Twitch: idk, its just like.. delays with blizzard and patches, never surprises me anymore
[9:36:23] selling_cure: how long after classics og release was BC though? if you go by that logic should we even have bc yet?
[9:36:25] k1ngtmac: mlb! lol
[9:36:30] gooni_coyg: 
[9:36:43] Sincline387: @Sincline387 Clearly it's not ready or it'd be up
[9:36:52] stemss: 2021 Problems
[9:36:53] BigLoe: They said 6:00 pm pdt
[9:36:57] TMMOOF: oof ur right, blizzardcs tweet
[9:37:06] WalknDead: lol @Gooners
[9:37:13] Wickerman406: Big water bottle 💧
[9:37:14] Broomba: Hope lore is keeping his sanity
[9:37:25] Dragoncaller: Come on Towelliee stop picking on the small indie company lol.
[9:37:26] Descina: launcher and ingame launcher are still at 3
[9:37:32] OneNetGaming: Soda might be playing
[9:37:36] Celeriity: 2 weeks of pre patch becomes 13 days ...
[9:37:43] Mike190Twitch: Attack of the Clones
[9:37:49] ThatBoyMencho: It’s up on east coast services
[9:37:53] Broomba: True
[9:37:54] Hazno: this maintenance is one of the most complex maintenance they've done since.. ever?
[9:37:54] TombStoneMercenary: You think the whole covid and them not fully working from there offices has messed things up?
[9:37:56] TheItalianStallion321: you try to clone your undead mage and BOOM. now you're a tauren druid....whoops....
[9:37:57] Descina: i agree
[9:37:57] Kinghorn: yeah is classic shit
[9:37:58] Lazugo: It was the only system that they didnt mass test
[9:38:02] Ezekyler: they need to bring back to 35$ to fix it @towelliee KEKW
[9:38:03] gooni_coyg: That is why it cost 35 dollars. Now with 15 it makes problem. Give them money!
[9:38:05] tuplin: The decision came from higher up because of the content drought of Retail and they wanted something to gap it so they did this. Typical sales/upper management over extending and not listening to the engineers saying don't push this shit yet we need prep/test time
[9:38:06] Wildside1177: I bet the database migration uis taking longer than anticipated.
[9:38:07] volderon1396: easy fix... make cloning unavailable till launch of TBC and let us play lol

[9:39:14] metavahn231: COPIUM
[9:39:20] Hazno: @Wickerman406 tbc content won't release for another 2 weeks though, and now you get to join from the start along with everyone else :D
[9:39:24] gooni_coyg: Serious thing? Could they extend TBC? Could it happen tbh?

[9:51:45] Tigris002: dang still not up? D:
[9:51:53] Hazno: @TrevorAP I just read through their support page, and it doesn't say anything about a time limit to purchase the clone, they literally do what you suggested and create two instances of your character on classic and tbc, and you choose which one you want to keep, then you can pay to unlock the clone at a later date based on the snapshot from before the pre-patch
[9:51:54] zamboneknee: @ you sticking around?
[9:52:00] FerociouzMonk: they gonna go bye bye

[9:53:12] Hazno: @jasperboy same :)
[9:53:13] yshtola1337: i might have a queue cause my server windseeker is merged with alot of others
[9:53:22] pronkk_: thoughts on the bad batch tow?

[9:53:37] Whetss: Towelliee, which guild did you raid with back in the day?
[9:53:39] Ldysansa: No this is just like the old days. Maybe that is Blizzard point.
[9:53:40] TrevorAP: @Hazno Sounds like you had it right also, just annoying that putting paywall up adds a level of exclusivity. feels like it could cause issues to since they have to only work on the people who pay
[9:53:42] DallasEmbers: blizz screwed my plans i work 3rd shift.

[9:53:56] Ldysansa: They are taking us back

[9:54:29] tadekildzen: Shit got delayed?
[9:54:35] Skidakid223: 15 min yeah?
[9:54:36] Hazno: @TrevorAP I can see why they want to do it from a logistically standpoint.. that way they can get a sense of the resources they need to keep available for each "era", rather than always being prepared for a ton of player suddenly switching back and forth for free
[9:54:37] MrGattz: yes you did
[9:54:47] Tracon: Can I post a link? @Towelliee. Blizzard twitter post about the delay of pre-patch launch.

[10:05:34] LoseAlotLuke: I might dungeon spam my holy paladin
[10:05:35] Lesrek: Hell, whole reason I am playing BC is because Ret is actually somewhat playable, especially with prot paladin tanks
[10:05:42] Shrenko: new changes to tbc on wowhead
[10:05:50] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no shot bc will have more players, the hype and advertising behind vanilla was huge compared to bc

[10:07:53] Hazno: @coloradostrong literally says "While this is accurate, there is currently an issue that we are aware of that causes hitboxes, particularly Tauren hitboxes"
[10:07:54] Aierwin: I'm purchasing the boost as i don't have time to lvl to 60 in time. Expected prepatch to be atleast a month long.
[10:08:01] lawrenceb: Just watched a guy do it in 61 on the beta, on a shaman with no money or gear... and it could probably be done much faster

[10:09:31] cormander002: "...putting one of the brutosaurs into a panic"
[10:09:32] illydylly: We're being played so that we praise them when servers open "early". It's like a manipulative relationship none of us can escape :)
[10:09:42] Templexx: cloning is a lot of database movement too

[10:48:37] MoonChocolates: omfg I ordered tons of food and brought it home thinking prepatch is now LUL
[10:48:38] Mitchendo64: Yea i did that with my current pc
[10:48:42] blauerschlumpf1990: And it started at 7 am ?
[10:48:46] Mitchendo64: I wanted to go the more professional route
[10:48:49] Mitchendo64: this time
[10:48:53] LethalGamess: ill never order a prebuilt. such a rip off lol
[10:48:54] Artivicii: @Smoothvodka007 LUL
[10:49:03] Mitchendo64: plus it saved me 1k on 3090 ordering one from origin
[10:49:05] gurnt4: kind of worrisome there are 1900 of us watching a dude sleep lol
[10:49:05] HeBeDead: what was that coffee company that used to sponsor towelliee does anyone remember?

[10:50:24] HeBeDead: its actually so easy and streamlined now to build a pc, not worth paying the extra
[10:50:38] Mitchendo64: @LethalGamess 8000 dollar lesson
[10:50:40] LethalGamess: @Mitchendo the problem is the company you ordered it from, probably cant get a gpu for it since there rare right now to get
[10:50:41] deepwolf400: @Artivicii Damn, well I guess I'll be creeping then

[11:42:03] Lazugo: Players who are not satisfied with the selection of gear that the Great Vault has provided them with for the week can now opt to receive a new currency that will let them choose from a number of alternative rewards including Anima, Stygia, and Soul Ash. If you decide to go down this path, seek out Ko’tul next to the Great Vault to choose your reward.
[11:42:08] NoXious_67: @Foz119 how do you not understand that releasing a prepatch is totally diffrent than a beta? they are re releasing a whole new game basically, and that comes with a shit ton of bugs that they need to fix before we invade the servers. quit being salty, be patient, or go play retial
[11:42:10] MrSnekyDino: You can remove the ads if you want
[11:42:15] Lazugo: blizzard are listening

[12:01:17] BRUTALIT0PS: They might extend it actually imo. With all the hate they have been getting about it being just 2 weeks and after today, they might push it back a week. I would not be shocked
[12:01:35] Hazno: @TacoVendor93 yeah, the realm status page includes TBC Classic now

[12:02:07] GodKingMuninn: Damn wish we atleast had some wow music in the background
[12:02:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: just add an xp boost that last until launch
[12:02:19] lawrenceb: And I say that as someone looking forward to rushing a shaman
[12:02:34] GodKingMuninn: Honestly, I could see them doing that
[12:02:38] lawrenceb: I’d love to be wrong though
[12:02:39] Sonatta: @HaxzorJimDuggan lol... that'd delay prepatch even more
[12:02:42] GodKingMuninn: Also is the @ a person function gone?

[12:03:15] dreamwalker213: Sadge
[12:03:18] GodKingMuninn: If they sent out a 15% exp buff for the 2 weeks I think that would be dope
[12:03:22] Smodo420: worst part is I knew this shit would happen n still act surprised when the pull this shit

[12:11:54] BRUTALIT0PS: Ah, so you're one of the few North Americans in the Atlantic time zone
[12:12:00] metavahn231: they will just say "well you were paying for retail also"

[12:15:15] CrunkyBrewster: oh no im dead serious. i dont have sympathy when it comes to my dollar. and its not a case of me being angry at the poor guy who has to type out all of the funky little letters and doohickies to make the vidya game work for me.
[12:15:16] metavahn231: you can see they are rushing because they lost like 40% from retail
[12:15:21] Holysal: @mcjezuss 5
[12:15:21] Lulaboo: @BRUTALIT0PS He is
[12:15:28] BRUTALIT0PS: Good, he better
[12:15:33] WSeveryn: just made it harder to hit 60 now.  most of us work at least 8 hours a day and have a family now.  13 days to hit 60 is going to bgg e rough
[12:15:33] MrSnekyDino: they started at 7AM PST, where most of the Devs are located. Can't get much "earlier in the shift" than that.
[12:15:43] BlueBeast33: So Blizz were not prepared and now we have an one entire day less to level blood elf and draenei, nice
[12:15:49] zjordan88: how is this happening here but i see soda playing im confused

[12:16:15] zjordan88: ahh
[12:16:20] MrSnekyDino: Maintenance started at 7AM
[12:16:22] Sonatta: @Baleroc1 what makes you think EU will be immune to the delays?
[12:16:34] Naturalbeef: TBC Classic was not prepared!
[12:16:34] Broomba: @LonelySnek are you ok? Need to take your meds?
[12:16:34] BRUTALIT0PS: 7 am is when it went down, so you know they were there hours before that even. Best midshift NA 4 or 5 am
[12:16:43] Cidarr: The devs probably said it wasn't ready and management said "too bad, it's may 18th", this is usually how it goes
[12:16:45] MrGattz: !tbc

[12:17:30] BRUTALIT0PS: EU probably will get delayed a bit because of the NA issues, but not to the same extent because they will be more prepared
[12:17:46] ElderscrollsAdmin: is it really not coming online till fuckin midnight....  really
[12:17:58] lawrenceb: I just wanna be able to hit 60, 58 even... not sure if I can do it but I doubt losing this evening is the difference
[12:17:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: it can still be before then
[12:18:00] BRUTALIT0PS: No, it's midnight on the 20th
[12:18:02] ElderscrollsAdmin: this is massive delay for a fuckin prepatch  artoSmug artoSmug

[12:18:16] MrSnekyDino: @MrGattz As a MOD of this CHANNEL, I expect nothing LESS than you MARCHING over to Activision's office and DEMANDING they turn on the servers THIS INSTANT. Anything less is HERESAY and will cause mass RIOTS.
[12:18:32] MrGattz: @MrSnekyDino i meannnnnnnn
[12:18:36] GreenLinenShirt: wait did they delay it a again?
[12:18:39] Sicktrixan: Yeah we can expect US to launch with EU at this rate.
[12:18:40] Azradath: did they really ADD 7 hours to the maintenance
[12:18:41] BRUTALIT0PS: I stand with MrSnekyDino
[12:18:51] ElderscrollsAdmin: i mean this is the most pathetic patch launch ever   i mean   wow  artoSmug artoSmug artoSmug

[12:19:13] Kinghorn: sakuSnug
[12:19:14] BRUTALIT0PS: Except I will find anything less to be heresy
[12:19:16] MrSnekyDino: That's /s by the way, sorry for the BabyRage in chat @MrGattz
[12:19:16] lawrenceb: I’m thinking I’ll get up at like 2am and see

[12:19:26] MrGattz: @MrSnekyDino no i know it is haha
[12:19:27] DecayedmiNt: Blizzard really wanted to hit us with a nostalgia hit. They gave us the all day maintenance.
[12:19:32] Sicktrixan: I highly doubt they will launch it mid morning, they’ll probably wait till asmongold goes live in the AM
[12:19:37] BRUTALIT0PS: Time for your yearly shower too Gattz, weird
[12:19:37] Wulfgrym: yeah im going to be and will play tomorrow
[12:19:39] Kinghorn: I am gonna take a nap until midnightish and see how it is looking
[12:19:45] SilkeySmooth: they arnt going to work in to the wee hours of the morning to get it up
[12:19:46] CrunkyBrewster: yeah maintenance hours nostalgic to 2005 baby
[12:19:49] ElderscrollsAdmin: its tbc pre patch   i mean   how can you delay this long atpRtsuspectd atpRtsuspectd
[12:19:53] MrSnekyDino: Don't waste our time, I'll get the hose @MrGattz
[12:19:58] CrunkyBrewster: god i remember the bad ol days
[12:19:59] Sonatta: @Sicktrixan i highly doubt they care what Asmongold's schedule is
[12:19:59] jkitchin75: @Sicktrixan lol as if
[12:20:07] MrGattz: @MrSnekyDino now thats efficient!
[12:20:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: put the servers online or else it gets the hose again
[12:20:35] SilkeySmooth: expect a tweet for tomorrow
[12:20:35] ElderscrollsAdmin: ya imagine delaying a small ass patch this long atpRtsd4
[12:20:40] Sicktrixan: Lmao they’re not gonna launch it 1 am.
[12:20:43] ManicDrakeX: ManicDrakeX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[12:21:02] Sicktrixan: And I bet asmon will be live.
[12:21:04] DrakhanGaming: Wonder what the problem is that makes the delay 6 hours. you think its any in game issue or maybe theyre tryin to make the cash shop work?
[12:21:05] DecayedmiNt: They can launch it at 1am
[12:21:06] scelero: only reason they're extending this is because the in game store isn't working.  BET
[12:21:06] Sicktrixan: Coincidence as always
[12:21:10] SilkeySmooth: i bet they went home already
[12:21:31] skymercii: @scelero nah its the cloning for bc\

[12:22:03] Kinghorn: and everything
[12:22:03] brotherkirk: I work from home which is why I play wow all day, it's also the reason I don't apply to blizzard
[12:22:06] MrGattz: facts
[12:22:11] Sicktrixan: Why would blizzard launch 1 am when they could delay few more hours make way more money in the morning when all the streamers will be live? Use brain plz
[12:22:27] Kinghorn: towIgnit Sicktrixan
[12:22:27] BrewerBlake1: So shorten pre-patch to 2 weeks then they can't launch it in time so keep shortening it....
[12:22:36] A_Klimas: towDerp
[12:22:41] xCraziest: overtime labour is a fraction expense to corporation

[12:42:02] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: yep, i agree

[12:43:06] GoKu1g: I think blizzard under estimated how much work was required to get this going, Lets be fair...

[12:45:45] MiddlePhaze: np bro
[12:45:46] Naicella: yeah cant they just clone a server with the exact same setup?

[12:48:17] Smodo420: I kno he been up I can’t just be like boom n fall asleep is all I’m saying wish I could
[12:48:21] Squirrel_nutty: Towelliee goes back to sleep and the servers come up right away!
[12:48:32] Kinghorn: sleep meta > hot tub meta
[12:48:34] ZenoahTV: Is the DNS's fault
[12:48:34] matthew_ld: Is it faster to level in TBC pre patch
[12:48:35] come_at_me_brotatoe: observe the sleeping towellie in it's natural habitat
[12:48:38] scelero: the people working on the servers, dont even get free clones or boosts.  so i think that may be a factor too.  they dont care either
[12:48:39] Broomba: this isnt his first rodeo
[12:48:41] BRUTALIT0PS: @Smodo420 It is a rare gift few people possess
[12:48:54] Squirrel_nutty: there is a leveling boost in TBC
[12:49:15] Broomba: what would make the sleeping stream better is ony to cuddle next to him again
[12:49:18] TheItalianStallion321: wait, did he fall asleep that fuckin fast? i went to the bathroom
[12:49:20] TheItalianStallion321: oh hes moving
[12:49:22] TheItalianStallion321: hes ALIVE
[12:49:33] Feldemort_vn: Tbh I’m the same way when I want to sleep I knock out, having a comfy bed helps though
[12:49:44] AnubiS1690: Anyone that buys a boost or clone is a fucking pussy
[12:49:51] TheItalianStallion321: <<<<<pussy
[12:49:51] Apokolipz: illidan is laughing at blizzard they were not prepared
[12:49:52] Broomba: he will level to 60 faster sleeping than playing
[12:49:54] BRUTALIT0PS: I guess I am one
[12:49:56] Kinghorn: I should probably try to pass out now if I want to catch a few hours
[12:50:04] TheItalianStallion321: sorry i dont have time to play 18 hours a day
[12:50:05] Feldemort_vn: I think general notion here is we don’t care haha
[12:50:05] Kinghorn: night chat
[12:50:09] TheItalianStallion321: night King
[12:50:13] Squirrel_nutty: boosts are only a value of your time
[12:50:14] Jared948: "due to the leveling being 30% faster, we decided to take 30% of the two weeks given to you away, see you in 4 days KEKW

[12:50:24] Nitewhispere: time to for real make cookies now
[12:50:27] BRUTALIT0PS: Coming into a WoW channel and calling probably at least half of the chat a pussy is a great strat
[12:50:32] Broomba: @AnubiS1690 cool story oh by the way wheres your command to spit on people
[12:50:42] Vorog1: Damn it was pushed back to 10PM now
[12:50:42] TheItalianStallion321: @brutalitops lol
[12:50:48] AnubiS1690: Fact is, you didn’t earn your character if you boost.
[12:50:53] wolfbane200ser: Lmfao
[12:50:53] prestilo: unfortunately i gotta wait 7more hours for prepatch Sadge
[12:50:54] ogkoop: excellent i found a stream i can come to to complain about the delayed launch
[12:50:56] AnubiS1690: Didn’t work for it
[12:50:59] matthew_ld: imagine the people who took work off lmao
[12:51:02] BRUTALIT0PS: You didn't earn an education most likely
[12:51:06] BRUTALIT0PS: What is your point?
[12:51:07] Squirrel_nutty: nope AnubiS1690
[12:51:07] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: i'm boosted and i earned it by working for the money
[12:51:11] CritcobainTV: more sleeps FeelsBadMan
[12:51:19] Squirrel_nutty: thats your view not everyone else's

[12:52:32] AnubiS1690: Not even to mention that Blizzard exists in its current state directly because of people that buy things like boosts.

[12:53:18] TheItalianStallion321: i dont know if we have a mod here with us Broomba
[12:53:18] froodyo: Not sure if this is a wow stream or a sleeping stream…
[12:53:19] SuperBrotendo: @AnubiS1690 imagine thinking you have the only correct opinion
[12:53:31] NoXious_67: Servers going live soon?
[12:53:32] TheItalianStallion321: oh hes anal all right Crit
[12:53:33] BRUTALIT0PS: He must have the worst case of hemorrhoids
[12:53:41] prestilo: 16minutes Nox.
[12:53:43] Sicktrixan: @froodyo blizzard is succeeding then
[12:53:44] thiirinz: has anone actually played TBC Pre patch yet? like did the servers crash? or are they doing maintenance still
[12:53:46] sapishfps: Sleeping stream for a prepatch? LUL
[12:53:47] TheItalianStallion321: negative @noxious87
[12:53:47] Broomba: @TheItalianStallion321 says there is at least 8-10 in channel
[12:53:49] AnubiS1690: Well okay I don’t mean to come across like that. I should chill. But what I’m saying still stands
[12:53:50] metavahn231: leveling boosts are pretty harmless, we can complain when they add actual power boosts
[12:53:58] Feldemort_vn: @anubis1690 I’ll do you one better I’m not getting a boost I’m getting the deluxe edition LUL
[12:53:59] SuperBrotendo: @AnubiS1690 no it doesn't
[12:54:05] BRUTALIT0PS: How does it stand? It has no legs
[12:54:07] AnubiS1690: It 100% does
[12:54:07] Sicktrixan: Blizzard content @ its finest boys
[12:54:09] SLOPEiZ: its sleeping until servers are up? xD
[12:54:10] TheItalianStallion321: @Broomba they may have went afk when towel go sleepy
[12:54:14] Aejacks: servers aint comin up for another 4 hours according to blizz
[12:54:15] SuperBrotendo: @AnubiS1690 no. it doesn't 3Head
[12:54:19] Murlocz: @Feldemort_vn Do Deluxe edition include a boost? If so im getting it
[12:54:20] Squirrel_nutty: your argument stands on shaky ground
[12:54:22] Broomba: towellliee would have done it
[12:54:27] BRUTALIT0PS: Give me a legit reason it stands and I will stand beside you 100%
[12:54:30] TheItalianStallion321: oh definitely
[12:54:31] froodyo: I may get a boost, still debating
[12:54:34] Feldemort_vn: @murlocz yes it does thankfully
[12:54:37] jubadubs: Blizz has second shift working the problem
[12:54:38] Murlocz: EZ
[12:54:43] Macroversal_: sleep strem now?
[12:54:45] Feldemort_vn: Rejoice mount and boost inc
[12:54:45] BookeR182: anybody know if EU server update has been delayed yet too or is it just americans?
[12:54:48] Sicktrixan: Thousands probably took work off for this
[12:54:53] jubadubs: third shift is about to tag in
[12:54:55] froodyo: I have 3 kids, no time for leveling from 1-70
[12:54:55] TheItalianStallion321: blizz pulling a 24 hour all nighter
[12:55:03] BRUTALIT0PS: I did Sicktrixan a year ago
[12:55:03] Squirrel_nutty: Booker182 there prob trying to find a fix aswell
[12:55:05] CritcobainTV: That's a long night if it lasts 24 hrs
[12:55:06] prestilo: im not a fan of the boost, but tbh i couldn't care less. doesn't affect my gameplay.
[12:55:11] Murlocz: @froodyo Should work on getting a 4th instead of leveling KEKW
[12:55:18] AnubiS1690: It’s my opinion that you suck if you boost, but it is an absolute fact that those who buy boosts made Blizzard the way they are. Sell outs.
[12:55:22] Feldemort_vn: I usually have work off for today but I already knew they would have issues
[12:55:34] froodyo: @murlocz I have twins on the way actually lol
[12:55:41] Squirrel_nutty: AnubiS1690  we have a tearm for people like you... Candy
[12:55:42] SuperBrotendo: @AnubiS1690 an absolute fact KEKW
[12:55:43] Murlocz: @AnubiS1690 Why you unsubbed :(
[12:55:43] niadus1: Ignorance at its finest @AnubiS1690
[12:55:45] Sicktrixan: @brutalit0ps haha ikr I’ve been preparing my BE for months
[12:55:47] CritcobainTV: @AnubiS1690 what does boosting have to do with your skill in the game? what?
[12:55:49] AnubiS1690: In no way do I blame Blizzard. Who wouldn’t do what they did? You people gobbled even bit of it
[12:55:51] prestilo: lol i just got an update for classic
[12:55:51] BRUTALIT0PS: So people buying services offered by a company that they enjoy is a bad thing?
[12:55:56] Bowline21: wtf is going on here? i just joined.
[12:55:56] CritcobainTV: That's probably the most ignorant statement i've ever heard lmfao
[12:56:04] luna_vix1127: Actually @AnubiS1690 activision made blizzard what blizzard is now.
[12:56:10] BRUTALIT0PS: @Sicktrixan I lost my job a year ago because of the pandemic, I was kidding, lol
[12:56:14] Sicktrixan: @brutalit0ps not at all, as long as blizz doesn’t pay to win I don’t give a shit
[12:56:16] TheItalianStallion321: so people who level 1 character as their main but dont want to level alts....suck? LOL thats an amazing theory

[12:56:38] CritcobainTV: This man is riding something other than a horse KEKW
[12:56:39] Murlocz: @Sonatta KEKW
[12:56:41] TheItalianStallion321: HOLY SHIT. GUYS. HE WILL SAY TO THAT YOUR FACE IN PERSON
[12:56:42] TheItalianStallion321: OH NO
[12:56:50] BRUTALIT0PS: @AnubiS1690 But what makes it bad or wrong or makes people "pussies"
[12:56:55] SuperBrotendo: holy crap my face in person

[12:56:58] luna_vix1127: oh no a nerd that will say something
[12:57:01] Sicktrixan: Pixels don’t bother me the ones you pay for are instantly less attractive IMO no sense of accomplishment doesn’t bother me at all
[12:57:08] AnubiS1690: I agree I shouldn’t have said pussies
[12:57:08] Murlocz: @AnubiS1690 You suck for not supporting this channel anymore, unsubbed Kappa
[12:57:13] mikejames01: @AnubiS1690 STFU

[12:57:52] luna_vix1127: Lets all be real activision made blizzard what they are today.
[12:58:04] BRUTALIT0PS: @AnubiS1690 MY point is you can hate it all you want, but there is obviously a demand for it and it does not hurt anyone for it to be a service. If you do not like it, don't buy it. Heck, don't invite anyone to your group who got boosted, but you don't need to lash out like that.
[12:58:04] Aserak: what server is towelliee going to be on in TBC?
[12:58:07] TheItalianStallion321: @bladewolf1127 i will never disagree with that statement

[12:59:49] BRUTALIT0PS: @critcobain I am intrigued to know what that even means
[12:59:53] TheItalianStallion321: @prestilo for all i know, its on schedule for tomorrow. unless they encounter problems as well
[12:59:57] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS idk ask him he sadi it
[12:59:58] CritcobainTV: Said it *
[13:00:06] BRUTALIT0PS: He's busy typing out his butt
[13:00:06] Sicktrixan: He prob meant sicko
[13:00:10] BRUTALIT0PS: I mean his but
[13:00:10] prestilo: @TheItalianStallion321 grazie :)
[13:00:11] jubadubs: I said Butt
[13:00:23] Broomba: i dont think anubis1690 can apologize
[13:00:28] Nitewhispere: there is always a but
[13:00:37] TheItalianStallion321: GUESS WHAT?? CHICKEN BUTT
[13:00:38] luna_vix1127: @AnubiS1690 Let people do what they want. If they wanna spend money to boost let em. Its not like they are making the game less fun for you. Just means less people to fight over your low level mobs for ;)
[13:00:50] mceslex: it's funny, Activision rushed TBC because of AOC and AOC delays their game because of TBC FortHype
[13:00:51] SuperBrotendo: he must be typing a paragraph right now. a fuckin diatribe
[13:00:53] jubadubs: butts are like assholes,  everyone has got one
[13:00:53] Coop56: Is there a command for a link to the playlist he has going right now?
[13:00:53] CritcobainTV: Bro i can imagine how much sweat is dripping down this mans neckbeard while he angrily tries to defend himself
[13:01:20] TheItalianStallion321: i swear, i love this community
[13:01:29] mikejames01: he need to go to asmon stream he is in the wrong one
[13:01:35] BRUTALIT0PS: I am anxiously awaiting this but, almost as much as awaiting Nite's butt
[13:01:36] doitforthem: Guys the lvl boost is going to be available now or only on release ?

[13:01:42] voorheesje: @critcobain actually I just slipped on that sweat of his
[13:01:51] NoXious_67: where the fuck are the prepatch servers? do they have to make a whole new set of servers T_T
[13:01:51] CritcobainTV: @voorheesje D: i hope ur alright my dude
[13:01:51] Feldemort_vn: Lmao neckbeard I wonder if @anubis1690 is going to run off to the hot tub streams
[13:01:52] BRUTALIT0PS: @doitforthem pre-patch launch if I am correct
[13:01:56] Squirrel_nutty: level boost is once the pre patch goes live
[13:01:59] luna_vix1127: i wanna boost now just to make him pissed lol
[13:02:00] GAUNERR_: @mceslex what is AOC?
[13:02:00] AnubiS1690: It is definitely the truth, whether we like it or not. A lot of people are pretty mad at Blizzard for being “Greedy”, right? So they will sell a ton of these boosts and make millions. They will then have meetings about what’s the NEXT thing we can get away with. So as consumers, we actually hold the power of how those meetings go. They may or may not decide that stuff like this doesn’t sell AND it’s bad PR, so they stop.
[13:02:04] SuperBrotendo: THERE IT IS
[13:02:05] TheItalianStallion321: ESSAY
[13:02:06] Nitewhispere: it's like when people complain that all I wanna do is farm mats in the game. It's my favorite thing to do. you aren't paying for my sub so shush.
[13:02:07] SuperBrotendo: A THESIS
[13:02:08] CritcobainTV: AYYYE HE DID IT

[13:03:28] CritcobainTV: ANALBUS
[13:03:28] BRUTALIT0PS: @AnubiS1690 But see, that is your mistake. You are listening to the vocal minority. There is obviously a demand for it, or they would have closed it already. Just because you and maybe 20% don't like it, there is still an 80% who does. So why should the vocal outrage override the passive enjoyment?

[13:48:53] prestilo: To be clear, they extended it twice ?

[13:49:07] Hazno: @prestilo yes, once by 3 hrs, then again by an additional 4 hrs
[13:49:09] Dalsonson: It’s likely something with the character clone service @atomicanders
[13:49:16] prestilo: Big yikes LUL
[13:49:17] Dalsonson: Vanilla Era are also down
[13:49:24] AtomicAnders: I just want my fresh belf like everyone else
[13:49:25] PaladinNynx: nope player mail system
[13:49:32] Hazno: @AtomicAnders I recommend you read the recent blue post to see what this patch actually entails
[13:49:42] Hazno: from a technical standpoint that is
[13:49:45] prestilo: i think NA releases the same as EU at this point

[13:50:48] twebb321: sleep stream huh?
[13:51:04] sh0tcaller615: lol just noticed sleep stream
[13:51:04] Hazno: @Dalsonson not the instant send, no, but the integrity check they did for the actual mail in player mailboxes discovered an issue so they had to recover tons of data to copy the data again and run another integrity check etc
[13:51:09] BRUTALIT0PS: Howdy y'all
[13:51:34] Lulaboo: @BRUTALIT0PS Hiiii

[13:52:29] SonofHorus82: I just got here. What's that link that was posted?
[13:52:29] Exxcar: Its not even that their hands are full... its the sheer amount of data that they had to restore and then copy again
[13:52:30] ElderscrollsAdmin: @Squirrel_nutty what do you mean by he doing the tango ??
[13:52:30] BRUTALIT0PS: ONY IS BACK

[13:54:27] Lulaboo: @BRUTALIT0PS Cookies very delicious
[13:54:53] BRUTALIT0PS: I am aware. Nite has made them a few times
[13:54:56] Hazno: considering they discovered the data integrity issue with player mail during NA maintenance, I hope they were able to apply a fix before they started EU maintenance, fingers crossed
[13:55:04] BRUTALIT0PS: Nite knows her baking stuff
[13:55:07] patrik2288: EU will play prepatch before NA if they take any longer. KEKW
[13:55:39] foomzx: please dont make the mistake i did and browse the wow forums right now. i just lost 500 iq points
[13:55:41] BRUTALIT0PS: I think the EU will get delayed an hour or two at most, if any
[13:55:44] ibboolin: So all this was because of mail?
[13:55:52] wadethewaters: apparently
[13:55:53] Thoreya: yes
[13:55:59] ibboolin: Oof
[13:56:16] wadethewaters: the funny thing is they are probably restoring marks that will expire due to the time limit
[13:56:20] BRUTALIT0PS: @foomzx I was just talking to someone in whispers for 20 minutes who called me arrogant for saying Asmongold puts on an act on his channel

[13:58:31] MuttonChopins: anyone know if every streamer who went PvP in classic is going into Atiesh in TBC? I notice Soda having Atiesh in his title
[13:58:33] BRUTALIT0PS: I would probably wait a day or two before getting addons
[13:58:37] Ocavi: just go for waelock addons
[13:58:58] dv_domino: new blue post on wowhead

[14:01:05] Thoreya: they already stated what the hold up is
[14:01:08] Thoreya: its the mail system
[14:01:18] BRUTALIT0PS: @Reaperkity The issue stems from a problem they discovered with mail
[14:01:23] Richton867: He's so beautiful when he's sleeping. Like an Angel.
[14:01:27] cineris_3: its all those BG Marks everyone stored up, broke everything
[14:01:33] skymercii: ^
[14:01:44] BRUTALIT0PS: I would not be surprised
[14:01:50] BookeR182: ingame mail? its broke or what?
[14:01:52] BRUTALIT0PS: I am sure it is more than just that though
[14:01:58] skymercii: is it up? simplSIP
[14:02:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: a lot of people store shit in the mail because item space is so limited and they dont want to risk people losing all of it
[14:02:02] MrSnekyDino: Big surprise, BG marks and hurried alt mail killed the release. WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED???
[14:02:07] Arocian: lots using mail as bank, ops

[14:02:38] Squ1d_tv: you idiots not checking your mail. this is your fault XD
[14:02:39] skymercii: bruh simplLOL
[14:02:41] Hazno: @Booker182 they discovered an issue during the integrity check for all player mail, so they have to restore all mail data and ensure nothing is missing, and it's a ton of data they need to copy and verify etc
[14:02:41] Arocian: haha
[14:02:48] rheibear: its the cloning that is causing the issue
[14:03:02] Squirrel_nutty: no
[14:03:02] mekintesh511: squ1d i know for a fact it is your fault
[14:03:03] rheibear: no
[14:03:04] NoXious_67: no

[14:03:48] edeasknight: -fixed an issue where people could purchase multiple boosts
[14:03:53] Hazno: @MrSnekyDino they would never dare after all the effort that went into getting Classic up, both from their end and the players chanting for it

[14:04:19] BRUTALIT0PS: @SonofHorus82 Preach!
[14:04:25] Richton867: they are also frantically trying to add pet battles last minute
[14:04:32] skymercii: i remember waiting 24 hours one time
[14:04:33] MrSnekyDino: Getting classic up was never about keeping classic alive forever. It was about restarting the pre-Cata nostalgia. It was always a plan to move forward. This isn't Jagex after all.
[14:04:35] Naturalbeef: I blame the gold farmers and all their mail
[14:04:37] Squirrel_nutty: richton777  stop making shit up
[14:04:54] skymercii: @richton777 dont spread misinformation
[14:05:00] Richton867: @Squirrel_nutty i'm not. there was a huge demand for pet battles.
[14:05:05] BRUTALIT0PS: NO or then!
[14:05:07] SonofHorus82: I had a toon on Icecrown when the game first came out. I remember the 4 day wait.
[14:05:07] Eye_dr0ps_: This is a Twitter/Social media  campaign... Kappa
[14:05:11] Hazno: @MrSnekyDino players primarily wanted Classic, not a second run of all expansions.. TBC Classic is just a bonus on what was promised

[14:05:15] Squirrel_nutty: richton777 your talking bollox and you know it
[14:05:18] grimsarmy: the only thing i can think of to solve the mail issue is to make every person go back to classic servers to delete mail or collect it to proceed
[14:05:28] skymercii: @Squirrel_nutty thats cap
[14:05:33] MuttonChopins: I dont think it was gold farmers, they might of had an error where in classic you could see your mail but in tbc you couldnt not sure
[14:05:34] Moobot: Type with English letters please marcolowmk6
[14:05:43] skymercii: simplLOL
[14:05:49] skymercii: moobot doesnt like you
[14:05:51] Eye_dr0ps_: Minor bug? Give us 9 hours... I don't think so! Kappa
[14:05:53] Richton867: some people are so easy LUL
[14:05:55] MrSnekyDino: No one ACTUALLY wanted a permanent classic. There's a reason PServers never last long... Naxx ends and it gets boring as shit.
[14:05:56] Lulaboo: I vaguely remember wow devs telling people to empty their mailbox before BC came out the first time
[14:06:00] marcolowmk6: Wtf french go
[14:06:02] Squ1d_tv: moobot hates the swed flag i guess
[14:06:02] Cineron: this dude sleepin in a category
[14:06:18] BRUTALIT0PS: @Lulaboo Now that you mention it, I think I do too
[14:06:26] Thoreya: i see all the people who never watched a towelliee marathon for an expansion
[14:06:29] marcolowmk6: Je t’aime
[14:06:30] Squ1d_tv: or switzerland flag
[14:06:40] marcolowmk6: 🇨🇭 yeeah
[14:06:47] leadtooth: why are we watching this man sleep?
[14:06:48] daveygravey: why is there 2 games now classic and tbc classic?
[14:06:48] skymercii: @Lulaboo i  remember watching my friend wait for hours on hours on hours waiting for the bc to come out the first time
[14:06:50] SonofHorus82: @Lulaboo that was way to long ago for me to remember.
[14:06:52] SpookyPigeon2: i think thats a good idea. ill go back to sleep till 10 pacific
[14:06:58] daveygravey: I thought tbc classic isnt till june 1st
[14:07:03] MrSnekyDino: @MrSnekyDino And fortunately they are catering to that want! But it's also why we are waiting.
[14:07:06] ManBats: pre patch
[14:07:08] skymercii: this is just the prepatch
[14:07:10] SpookyPigeon2: pre patch starts today, in theory
[14:07:11] codebake23: we forreal watching this dude sleep
[14:07:16] Hazno: @MrSnekyDino yet players have been asking for Classic for years.. and heck, even if "no one" wanted permanent Classic, people would cry loud as fuck if Blizzard forcefully moved everyone to TBC
[14:07:21] Eye_dr0ps_: They are just trying to get attention on social media, all game devs do this! Kappa
[14:07:21] indestructible123: hey all is Towelliee raiding tonight on retail?
[14:07:27] RoxxusPlays: Aw look at ony
[14:07:29] Squirrel_nutty: no raids tonight
[14:07:30] SonofHorus82: @daveygravey it isnt. This is the pre-patch. They're pretty much adding everything in except for opening the dark portal.
[14:07:31] pronkk_: @indestructible123 no
[14:07:35] RoxxusPlays: i htink that's his dog's name
[14:07:35] MuttonChopins: prepatch starts tomorrow for east coast players LULW
[14:07:35] marcolowmk6: Breaking news swiss its best pays for the World 😂
[14:07:36] skymercii: @Hazno imagine the uproar that would cause
[14:07:36] daveygravey: what game do I play pre-patch on tbc classic or classic?
[14:07:38] indestructible123: k thanks
[14:07:38] BRUTALIT0PS: @shujo23 No, we're watching a man AND his adorable dog sleep
[14:07:43] Hazno: @bloodyreapr exactly
[14:07:45] mekintesh511: play the fucking game and shove ur feelings in ur bum bum
[14:07:59] marcolowmk6: Nazi
[14:07:59] Hazno: @daveygravey tbc classic
[14:08:06] daveygravey: @SonofHorus82 so I play on tbc classic
[14:08:17] skymercii: @Hazno people think the uproar is bad now can u imagine the uproar they would get if they forced everybody to tbc
[14:08:20] SonofHorus82: @daveygravey yeah you want TBC classic.
[14:08:22] daveygravey: @Hazno oh ok it was confusing since there is 2 of them
[14:08:31] Richton867: I'm in New Zealand. Should I play in NA server or Oceanic?
[14:08:41] MrSnekyDino: @Hazno Uh... like they did back in the day? Like they do with every expac? Sure, reddit has a vocal minority that says they want to say, but they will either re-roll or pay $15 to move on within a few months. Classic was never meant to last forever, just as vanilla was never meant to last forever.
[14:08:43] wadethewaters: Look at how peaceful they are
[14:08:47] JuveyUno: 10pm where we at blizzard?
[14:08:52] Eye_dr0ps_: @Lulaboo Why?
[14:08:57] Hazno: @daveygravey if you want to progress along to TBC you don't have to download/install anything except what the launcher automatically updates for you :D
[14:09:04] Jockulation: Quick, someone give him a wet willy

[14:10:00] SonofHorus82: I have the next 2 days off due to my second vaccine in the morning. This is actually perfect for me.
[14:10:05] Nitewhispere: lol Lula
[14:10:05] Hazno: @MrSnekyDino sure, many reacted poorly when TBC was first announced as an expansion and not an extension of Vanilla, but it only took a single expansion and now everyone expects new expansions.. these are different times, you cannot compare the two
[14:10:06] daveygravey: why would u have pets and kids
[14:10:13] Jockulation: Kids are at school..    Works perfectly for Australia

Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || TBC launch is on June 1st
[14:18:46] Hazno: @WeedIsMySin1 sort of, except the new Outland content, but all class changes etc will be in the game
[14:18:49] Nitewhispere: I was making cookies and then was like...do I keep making cookies or just put the dough up? but there wasn't very much left... the choices -_-
[14:18:55] Nitewhispere: I ended up making the rest of the cookies
[14:18:59] WeedIsMySin__: ok ty
[14:19:08] SonofHorus82: @Nitewhispere well shit... Also, during my google confirmation the top responses were Is Doc McStuffins dying of cancer? and Is Doc Mcstuffins a serial killer?
[14:19:13] rovermike: to much g fuel
[14:19:16] TwitchGurls: is it possilbe to be a Belf pally?
[14:19:20] BRUTALIT0PS: @WeedIsMySin1 Kind of. It doesn't have the new continent and 60-70, but mainly
[14:19:31] Nitewhispere: those are all valid questions
[14:19:35] Hazno: @WeedIsMySin1 the only difference is that on June 1st the portal to Outland will open, but we get to play around with all character changes before that and play/level up the new races in their new starting zones etc
[14:19:35] painfll: hi

[14:20:15] Nitewhispere: cooookiesss
[14:20:16] xluckydawgx: lmao good, aint no one playing for a long time he needs to sleep
[14:20:18] BRUTALIT0PS: No servers up
[14:20:23] WeedIsMySin__: How long will it take for a 'new' player to level from 1-60? Only played a few hours of Classic so i wont be effecient. Is it doable in 2 weeks?
[14:20:24] SonofHorus82: He'll wake up, check his phone, then crash out again.
[14:20:30] BRUTALIT0PS: ^^
[14:20:31] Naturalbeef: Lore on the line
[14:20:38] BRUTALIT0PS: Or storm out of the room for food
[14:20:45] L1ghthoof: @WeedIsMySin1 prob not
[14:20:54] SonofHorus82: Also yes everyone the servers are up. The banner reading "No servers are currently available" is just a clever ruse.
[14:21:16] Squ1d_tv: @WeedIsMySin1 anywhere from 10-20 days played time i would say for someone new not getting bosted
[14:21:19] Hazno: @WeedIsMySin1 it depends a lot on how many hours a day you can spare, but I would strongly recommend grabbing the Questie addon, it helps you to see quest objectives on your map, it should definitely make leveling faster/easier
[14:21:24] BRUTALIT0PS: @WeedIsMySin1 Doable, yes, depends on the amount of time you can dedicate to it
[14:21:33] Jynt334: World of Warcraft Classic has a spot in the Store now!

[14:21:54] TwitchGurls: oh awesome...Belf pally....cant do it in SL...so it will be popular in TBC
[14:21:56] BRUTALIT0PS: Then doable
[14:22:05] BRUTALIT0PS: Definitely get questie addon
[14:22:09] WeedIsMySin__: kk ty
[14:22:14] xluckydawgx: There he goes
[14:22:23] Hazno: @WeedIsMySin1 that shouldn't be a problem :) also you only need to be level 58 to enter Outland
[14:22:33] BRUTALIT0PS: And find a good guild with people around your level range to do dungeons and stuff with
[14:22:46] wheels171: im a lv 36 warrior what should i do when the pre patch starts?
[14:22:46] SonofHorus82: the character clone is live in the shop. How long has that been there?

[14:23:21] metavahn231: i cant wait for the giant blue goat zerg
[14:23:21] Anguyen92ab: If I don't commit to any schedules, I can go ahead and join the Hammer Squad guild if I ask in Discord right?
[14:23:27] Hazno: @WeedIsMySin1 they have made mounts accessible at level 30 rather than 40 with the pre-patch, and reduced the amount of XP you need as well as increased the amount of XP you get from quests up to 60, so overall leveling in TBC pre-patch will be a lot faster than in Classic
[14:23:28] wheels171: @wheels171 will do where should i level tho?
[14:23:37] SonofHorus82: @Anguyen92ab sure can
[14:23:46] BRUTALIT0PS: @Anguyen92ab Yes, we are not a hardcore guild
[14:23:51] Jynt334: they don't have the boost on the store yet but the Clone is on there and so are the Classic/BC Classic Character transfer
[14:24:01] BRUTALIT0PS: @wheels171 What have you done already?
[14:24:13] BRUTALIT0PS: @wheels171 And are you Horde or Alliance?
[14:24:19] tortis25: Im in !!!! its doneee finallyyyy
[14:24:21] SonofHorus82: @wheels Stranglethorn is always good. Tons of quests ranging from like level 30 to 50 in there.
[14:24:33] Anguyen92ab: All right, I'll consider it.  I'll be probably playing more BC until 9.1 comes up or whenever the AH sales in retail dries up for me.

[14:27:31] LieutenantNoFuks: Are oranges called oranges because oranges are orange or is orange called orange because oranges are orange?
[14:27:39] Anguyen92ab: Don't think JC or engineering would be money endeavors at that point.
[14:27:39] BRUTALIT0PS: @Anguyen92ab Mining
[14:27:43] SonofHorus82: I actually did end up getting 6k points from that LUL
[14:27:46] skymercii: oh hes up
[14:27:47] Anguyen92ab: Something that doesn't require gathering.
[14:27:50] BRUTALIT0PS: Mining to fund the JC

[15:29:28] ExiaFTW: It was an issue with the mail
[15:29:29] Morpheusx25: @LeonardLongNips TRUE
[15:29:31] Fourleafjr: East coast over here, been waiting all day :/
[15:29:31] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I mean if they extend it again I think they jsut throw in the towel and say "we'll update you tomorrow morning."
[15:29:32] ChocoDecay: Hey Towelliee, hows it going man.
[15:29:33] Sonatta: the question is... can they "fix" the mail problem or avoid it... or will they have to restore the mail for EU too
[15:29:35] larryy122: eu time is 5:20 am
[15:29:39] jubadubs: california privelage
[15:29:39] Zadentv: this wouldve been really hard to test anyway
[15:29:39] stemss: @Cmill they changed it from 6pm PST to 10 pm PST 2 hours before 6PM
[15:29:40] pj352: its 5-6 am in EU we got all day ahead of us
[15:29:40] Broomba: Hawaii still has 6 hours left @towelliee
[15:29:41] DangerfieldSOSA: and theyre doiing it all from home lol
[15:29:43] Calthaza: EU is supposed to be online at 9am CET. So the ones that play in the evening still might be able even with 10h delay
[15:29:43] Sayryn: Oh shit that 800g
[15:29:47] nothumbgamer_ttv: uk time is 4:20 xD

[15:29:51] inebriatedgiraffe: Youtube is back up
[15:29:52] SlackerSlack017: might be some intern's fault
[15:29:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: they shut have shut the mail down
[15:29:59] Sonatta: the mail system they told us back at BC launch to empty out
[15:30:03] Cmill: @stemss doesn't mean they'll announce it before everytime
[15:30:05] andrewmb01: how bad was the first release :D
[15:30:05] bbLeggi: blame horders
[15:30:06] JayBeKay: @DangerfieldSOSA oh man that's a solid point
[15:30:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: should have
[15:30:15] saberix: blizzard is the only ones i know that have this level when it comes to shitting the bed on patches/update
[15:30:17] its_Steevee: normally its the female service to mess up weird
[15:30:20] Rakim88: they broke the mail system for one xpac... i cant remember which one
[15:30:21] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Probably got corrupted in the copy process.
[15:30:23] Eraste: too many chads farming bg marks danKEK
[15:30:26] stemss: is that why they shut down AH last week?
[15:30:36] zarillon1: how did literally no one at blizz think of this
[15:30:37] ThorH13: I remeber something like that as well
[15:30:37] Broomba: Yea
[15:30:37] Zadentv: all the people who farmed marks from bgs are on suicide watch if the mail expires
[15:30:39] hammack52: it most likely has to do with coping the mail twice for the copy system and it caused a cascade to the rest of the system
[15:30:39] Eye_dr0ps_: They had Auction House closed for a full week! EleGiggle
[15:30:41] TpageTV: Damn with the AH down i mailed everything to my bank alt and left in the the mailbox too ..
[15:30:48] AveragePvp: @zadentv trueeeeeee
[15:31:07] mrxanthus: BC was the worst and most chaotic Expansion Launch they ever launched, but ppl don`t remember the first few weeks of Bugsing Crusade
[15:31:11] Lokajin: Not like farming marks gives you any headstart your honor starved not mark starved for gear. Pre-farming marks was the dumbest thing ever.
[15:31:21] Calthaza: in retail, they changed api between vanilla and tbc as well. a huge change in the game. this time it is on the same platform, so less work on that
[15:31:28] Zadentv: easier to get honor than marks tho
[15:31:28] Funderik: this is why a cloning fee was put in place :P 2x the work.
[15:31:29] Garrujak: This is what people get for whining about the cost of the clone. Now they sent two workers home and we get huge delays
[15:31:37] ThorH13: DAT H20!!!
[15:31:44] ThorH13: there you go
[15:31:45] stemss: shit kinda makes u think they shoulda dumped classic LUL
[15:31:46] mitchumtx: think the servers will come up early?
[15:31:46] venombites17: lmfao classic blizzard bullcrap
[15:31:47] Eye_dr0ps_: So technically the mail's been f*ed up for like 10 days! Kappa
[15:31:52] Envythisnoob: !tbc

[15:31:55] andrewmb01: Its just a shame people don't have a lot of time in the pre patch.
[15:32:02] Sayryn: You done fucked up A-Aron
[15:32:06] Lokajin: Not really Zaden its the same no matter how you flip it, either way you need the marks its smarter to farm them when the new honor system is in place not before it. So your atleast GETTING the honor you need at the same time.
[15:32:08] Feldemort_vn: Aren’t they changing the mail system to be instant?
[15:32:10] AveragePvp: @lokajin yeah but where as you need like 110 ab marks for weps and gear and farming av is 10x better than losing abs I’d rather have an advantage on ab marks so I can do less
[15:32:12] Rocman: so issues with BC? sounds pretty classic authentic
[15:32:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://tbc.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-six-month-subscription-includes-imp-in-a-ball-toy-for-burning-322435

[15:32:23] hman1717: when do we get boost?
[15:32:24] UndeadGeneral27: Why is everyone upset over mail? Mailbox has only been down for like 14 hours
[15:32:26] Zadentv: yeah but the marks are more important
[15:32:27] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: I bet its gonna go past midnight
[15:32:30] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Barring any issue with something else it should hopefully be up in time.
[15:32:33] Fourleafjr: plz no ;-;
[15:32:33] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: i would bet all my channel pointz on it
[15:32:42] venombites17: but like wtf i bought a coffee and snacks to play for the evening
[15:32:46] hammack52: for those that are worried about your marks in the mail, look at it this way, if it was in the mail when the shut down happened and they are restoring the mail than you should still have time to get them out when the servers come up
[15:32:50] mitchumtx: it aint bad for me i took a nap! imma see if anyone in Hammer Squad is on that can carry me from 58-60
[15:32:51] Lokajin: @AveragePvp there is no advantage your wasting more time farming marks when your already honor starved when u could of been double dipping in your time. IE its a massive waste of time.
[15:32:53] oJNelly: this is pretty bad tbh
[15:32:57] saberix: been playin since vanilla
[15:33:05] AveragePvp: @lokajin not at all wtf
[15:33:07] andrewmb01: yeah 3 weeks to a month no problem
[15:33:09] Pamito: midnight PST or EST levelupThink
[15:33:12] AveragePvp: @lokajin lmao
[15:33:16] SlowpokeIsAGamer: The Commentary Gallery will combust if they push it into the morning hours. "Give us a free day!" "Delay the launch!"
[15:33:22] Zadentv: lokajin is mad he didnt farm marks and is behind
[15:33:24] mikejames01: The grind is real this time lol
[15:33:25] LeonardLongNips: But hey 14 days is plenty!
[15:33:26] andrewmb01: but yeah 13 days pre patch is crazy... good thing I am boosting

[15:48:21] venombites17: Does twitch not allow it to happen?
[15:48:24] Funderik: well, they sit on the edge of ToS with that content, at some point they have to fall either side of it.
[15:48:32] Mosoner: Yeah but you knew they would press Twitch to end that content so why not get out ahead of it and get rid of all that? That’s what I don’t get. Why let it continue and continue?
[15:48:35] erdls: shame, i guess thats the end of my toweliee hottub dreams
[15:48:38] maccaruso: I was a brand manager at one point.  I would blow a gasket if my product showed up on a hot tub stream
[15:48:39] Rakim88: @dondickrleone correct
[15:48:42] Sugdinnegen: SeemsGood
[15:48:42] Tiltedfeller: 10 day straight stream for BC?
[15:48:45] Feldemort_vn: Little imp is awesome
[15:48:48] icyhawtt: I guess since hotub streams are done I guess Alan is coming back to streaming
[15:48:53] elusiveleopard: It doesn't seem like the issue is removing / de-monetizing ads, the problem question is the removal happening without Twitch communicating that to one of their most followed / active channels
[15:48:54] GhettoBean: GhettoBean subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hammers up my guy! Pre Patch hype.. sorta?
[15:48:57] kings4320: Pardon my ignorance. Who got banned?
[15:48:58] AyyitsTK: So does this mean no more ads on her stream?? 😂😂 SWEET!!
[15:49:03] Richton867: they shouldn't be on a platform that has an age of 13+
[15:49:10] Richton867: it's clear what they're doing
[15:49:20] Madox99: Yeah i heard people talk about that does that mean no more ads haha
[15:49:21] Richton867: and they literally link to their porn in their streams
[15:49:24] Rakim88: twitch is 18+ tho
[15:49:30] Richton867: it's not
[15:49:38] Comrade_Reaper: twitch is 13+
[15:49:40] Rakim88: on those streams it is
[15:49:40] Richton867: 13+
[15:49:47] sticksaredrifting: @richton777 true
[15:49:48] Bunring: There's 18+ warnings on those streams.
[15:49:50] RIPTobyKeith: hey @Towelliee i responded to your psn message about the name thing :)
[15:49:56] Bel_Daeva: @richton777 - So are you going to petition Twitch to stop streams of GTA which is an R18+ game? Since it's a site for 13 year olds?
[15:49:57] Richton867: there is no 18+ category
[15:49:59] Eastwicksavag3: morning
[15:50:04] Comrade_Reaper: yeah but that dont matter if its a warning
[15:50:06] Comrade_Reaper: LMFAO
[15:50:07] Templexx: LOL GOT EMMM
[15:50:10] Mosoner: @richton777 they cannot and do not reference OF on Twitch they would get banned for sure, don’t be a sheep
[15:50:15] Madox99: yeah its not really that hard to click yes
[15:50:17] UNSUNG_HER0: i just think its hilarious that she "didnt see it coming" lol
[15:50:18] MarquisLek: mindshare economics
[15:50:20] Comrade_Reaper: i did that
[15:50:20] venombites17: pretty sure on the app store it it 17+
[15:50:24] z3rodown: It's the same as youtube. The advertisers screwed everyone there too.
[15:50:26] TrevorAP: they dont even ask on porn anymore do they
[15:50:28] bendoverr99: wait what are we even talking about and what happend? i was pooping
[15:50:29] Rakim88: does do something tho, its legal protection for twitch
[15:50:34] Rakim88: it
[15:50:36] Broomba: Likes a 8 year making a Facebook page!
[15:50:39] Comrade_Reaper: twitch just have to fix their stupid ToS and make it bannable
[15:50:42] Richton867: @Mosoner they had links to all their socials in their stream pages...
[15:50:46] MisterPeace: yeah that was awkward lol
[15:50:49] Templexx: its changed so much. i been watching on twitch since 2011/12 its nuts
[15:50:52] Rakim88: it is, condom ads r common YEP
[15:50:52] Bunring: Trojan ads are always on twitch, true
[15:50:56] TombStoneMercenary: Trojan and tampax ads have been playing lately
[15:50:59] luna_vix1127: whoa whoa i come in to hear about condoms wtf? XD
[15:50:59] elusiveleopard: Demonetizing and removing of ads wasn't the issue though... it was the fact that it happened without any comms from Twitch to a partner. That as a precedent is pretty worrying
[15:50:59] Sentexqt: people watching those streams dont need Trojans LUL
[15:51:08] Eraste: talk about wrong target audience KEKW
[15:51:10] ukwowclassic: aye wrapped your old man up before going in here :D
[15:51:12] Primo166: Nah, riding a hotdog in a blow up kiddie pool writing sub names on your arm in perm market just aint right LUL
[15:51:13] Maruika: i got some magnums bc of twitch and they didnt fit at all
[15:51:14] Hutsbane: I saw a Tampax one today
[15:51:16] mohmdoa: Touché
[15:51:17] Mosoner: @richton777 they link to a link hub not directly to OF on Twitch
[15:51:17] Funderik: people who watch those streams don't need condoms tho LUL
[15:51:26] Chaotic_Mind: people who her stream dont need rubbers they need paper towels
[15:51:28] Vashile: regardless of the content its wrong for Twitch to not notify a content creator, especially a partner, on actions to their channel.
[15:51:29] Naicella: yup Trojan is on twitch
[15:51:29] bendoverr99: !song
[15:51:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: unrealistic expectation even for Trojan
[15:51:34] oraclespyro: @Towelliee  thought   twitch chooses your   commercials or is it your  sponsers?
[15:51:38] Panda_Locomotive: Yeah you don’t need condoms if you’re spending your time watching hot tub streams. Kappa
[15:51:39] Supers18: dd_swag thats how they operate
[15:51:39] Broomba: Like what I did as a kid - turn the channel dial on the tv to watch premium hbo and showtime
[15:51:42] shimwood: Can't wait for the vasectomy ads to start rolling Kappa
[15:51:44] Hutsbane: was a bunch of female streamers that was endorsing the commercial
[15:51:45] findobin: Talking about the Amouranth stuff?
[15:51:48] Richton867: @Mosoner oh so the 13 years old have to click an extra link. Ok
[15:51:50] SomarTv: i like the lights in the back they give the necrolord vibes
[15:51:52] r234t: Amazon, small indie company needs advertisers to survive BibleThump
[15:51:53] bendoverr99: @Towelliee towl what song is this playing right now it sounds familiar but forgot the name
[15:51:55] zgag: The big issues from the hot tub streamers with links to their Only Fans from their twitter which is linked on their twitch page.  The hot tub stream is mainly a peak and the OF is the full view of what the viewer is going to
[15:51:57] evandro_1988: any word on when TBC WILL BE BACK ONLINE
[15:52:00] MoonChocolates: loool
[15:52:01] Primo166: red shoe diaries hah...
[15:52:03] tarot_with_tricia: Red Shoe DIaries was the SHIT
[15:52:05] Rakim88: twitch uses warning for legal, ur right ad company can pull ads from twitch. but thats the risk twitch is playing. most ad companies dont care really till they get backlash for it
[15:52:05] Maruika: saturday night baby blue two
[15:52:06] ShaunsterTheMonster: hahah
[15:52:06] TenexCorp: i thin getting banned for nudity on your stream once or twice is warning enough to not do that stuff anymore :)
[15:52:09] Sentexqt: @mystero you know that's not sexual right? kekW
[15:52:10] raspyoftow: i remember those days
[15:52:10] ShaunsterTheMonster: I remember
[15:52:11] CostanzatheMage: First time I ever jerked off was to Red Show Diaries
[15:52:12] tarot_with_tricia: Wild Orchid
[15:52:20] Morpheusx25: @CostanzatheMage lol
[15:52:23] UNSUNG_HER0: @Vashile they did notify her 2 weeks ago warning her...she even talked about it on stream...she straight lied today for sympathy
[15:52:24] Rylexthegreat: Twitch keeps their pimp hand strong. Hoes better have my money and they better not fuck with my money KEKW
[15:52:25] DigiSeven: Lady Chatterly
[15:52:25] stratiss: Check the shop boosts got added
[15:52:28] Broomba: Red Shoes Diaries
[15:52:29] Darzetti_: @zgag truuuuuu
[15:52:33] rocthenite: oh shit i had tv in my room with showtime, let say it was my porn hub at 16
[15:52:33] maccaruso: A bigger deal to a streamer would be a brand sponsorship deal.  Advertisers would pull a deal in a heartbeat if you do shit that misrepresents their brand.
[15:52:34] kenni_8: @CostanzatheMage  LMFAO
[15:52:35] EpicSubset: Shannon Tweed was a nice person to chat with
[15:52:36] mrheimz: 1 hour 15 mins whoot PogChamp
[15:52:40] tarot_with_tricia: Shes old than that I think 60's
[15:52:40] Mosoner: @richton777 I mean that’s the formality and grey area they get away with and operate in lol but they can’t talk about it on camera on Twitch or link to OF in their bio directly
[15:52:42] Felazygaming: 64
[15:52:45] Pathwriter: 64
[15:52:48] RingoDingoDoo: Gene Simmons ruined everything

[17:08:41] reklebin: Funny how eu thinks they are all right. They probably got 10 hours worth of mail that needs to be checked for them
[17:08:51] Squ1d_tv: @Towelliee cause blizzard just wants to launch TBC and wipe their hands. havent they even said as much that they dont want to manage 2 MMO's?
[17:08:51] Sizzleman91: is he playing on ptr? how is he flying in shadowlands

[17:09:00] seo1978: exactly, if they had no idea they wouldnt have given a time frame, they thought theyd done their homework, they hadnt. it's an oversight, ofc it is.
[17:09:00] chummel92: They are rushing it out plain and simple
[17:09:03] BlewGamingGroup: because theyve spent all day getting the classic store set up so people can transfer servers and shit
[17:09:03] SeaJ4Y: excusing decades old, titan-sized company on issues releasing years old content KEKW

[17:10:12] retrofuture81: PTR always messes with my GPU...so yeah, I avoid it like the plague
[17:10:12] Squ1d_tv: @Towelliee didnt blizzard even say as much at one point that they dont want to manage 2 MMO's. If thats true its hard to believe they dont just want to spend no time managing it and want to release it and wipe their hands.

[17:30:24] Yuriismsr: @lordmyer the issues are more along the line with the splitting of servers and from what a blue post said earlier... something to do with mailboxes and trying to not lose people's mails in the transfers

[17:48:57] mitchumtx: i know you aint Towelliee, i am talking about the assholes that think they are entitled and want EVERYTHING to go smoothly!

[17:50:16] dilconia: they will say you can play retail no refund of time for you
[17:50:21] LawnSpeaker: @akafluffie are you retarded?
[17:50:22] ski4_: im quite excited i havent played tbc since I was a kid

[18:36:05] SilkeySmooth: worst launch in history.......i was here
[18:36:06] mlovas: In 30 minutes I either join the space goat race or go to sleep, win-win either way
[18:36:09] Krelivane_: There's nothing negative about it though. If it takes them longer to make sure it's a good experience, then that's good. It could take 48hours for all I care
[18:36:10] Edoscil: when you think everything is fine and at the end you get an ORA DB Error and you need to do everything again

[18:36:27] Zedar_Frost: @mystar_twenty I think the hype is more geared towards the experience of everyone jumping into a world and experiencing it at the same time. It's not the best xpac, but you get to play it from 60 to 70 again with everyone else

[18:36:51] quakegoogl: ruyu1
[18:36:57] swordart_19: KEKW
[18:36:59] dracullus: I know it's impossible to test, but if they would release TBC after 9.1 and make very long pre-patch, they would avoid many of these shit
[18:37:01] NewWorldReign: I do love the idea of that room phase.
[18:37:05] prettyboyproductions92: gonna be delayed til june 1st prob
[18:37:10] KaisenSiru: Delay hype PogChamp

[18:37:51] SlickKiller: i dont see how people mald over a pre patch delay, like tbc release delay i get would be way worse
[18:37:51] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[18:37:55] jasperboy: world first, first try, while blindfolded
[18:37:58] mlovas: At this rate they're probably just prepatching WotLK Classic and Deluxe Edition Invincible Toys into the shop. Balls to the wall.
[18:37:59] Envythisnoob: Kappa Kappa
[18:38:00] Kinghorn: give me ads and give me delays

[18:38:33] quakegoogl: towHorde draCozy
[18:38:34] Zedar_Frost: @mystar_twenty I know when I played BC, I was too young to appreciate it. I didn't actually play the game for real until WotLK. So, I'm personally looking forward to experiencing Outland when it isn't just a bunch of dead zones that people are forced to level through to get to later content
[18:38:39] FutileDiploma: Delay on the launch on a game that’s already launched years ago ❤️
[18:38:40] Havren13: 9.2 Chains and Whips

[19:14:39] dilconia: if they extend tbc they run the risk of stealign the thunder from 9.1

[19:14:49] findobin: they're gonna let you buy another boost per account for 40€

[19:15:23] ryanc1124: nvm.......
[19:15:23] TwoPieceSpecial: WOW players are like COD players keep accepting the same crap game after game as long as some shiny skins (mounts) are included. Only exception is they dont pay 15 dollars a month
[19:15:27] swordart_19: Delay HYPE
[19:15:30] Funderik: well it's prepatch not release so, some people just dont care yet

[19:16:19] LittleMissSakura: @Towelliee Yep like I said. Blizzard is recreating the original TBC launch experience. Hahaha!
[19:16:21] its_andyd: this is ridiculous
[19:16:25] Sacredtenshi: I feel like they have to extend prepatch by at least a week
[19:16:28] Funderik: calling they managed to turn all characters into vulpera
[19:16:31] Nauct: spilled some coffee on em
[19:16:33] gooni_coyg: It is bad because ppl want to lvl BE and spacegoat. Without that ppl would not care that much.

[19:16:48] edeasknight: they forgot to tell everyone to empty their mail or they'd lose it Kappa
[19:16:48] CrookedCrookK: Had they just closed the mailbox when they closed the AH this may have worked itself out down the road
[19:16:51] Chickat1: realm list is up but offline
[19:16:52] seo1978: you gotta hand it to blizz, i mean making a mess of launching the same game twice is some top notch consistency.
[19:16:53] sk1ppyrfc: blizz extended EU maintenance for another 9 hrs
[19:16:55] cabalish: cabalish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! HYPA HYPA

[19:17:32] RuinTV: Blizzard's quality of testing is in decline. We participate in most of their major tests, they are generally very short and I am skeptical of what benefit they are getting from them.
[19:17:33] Gizimoo86: but they promised enough time to level new races LUL
[19:17:36] Crowzcut: whats uk

[19:45:41] Niksen_99: MMO requires to play alot of hours thats why we are picky
[19:45:41] Nauct: @fourleafjr that's because we haven't gotten a good pvp MMO that isn't P2W
[19:45:45] espherosvs: If they are dumb yea...

[19:49:34] Fourleafjr: First Impressions matter
[19:49:37] Brobertos: Why do people always think endgame is "the" game? And the lvling process is just a tutorial? To me the leveling is the game
[19:49:39] Nauct: @aPandaAppears nice, I hope it's the best MMO ever
[19:49:42] fooxytv: Can we pay respect for the blizzard developers that have spent all day and into the night trying to fix the classic realms :D

[20:58:51] raisw: @Hitokiri83 thx!
[20:59:08] Triist0ne: !guild
[20:59:09] AnubiS1690: dude you cant make a level 1 clone of your character if you want the same name......
[20:59:13] Triist0ne: what server are you on?
[20:59:13] maklayy: Can you feel the leveling nerf @towelliee
[20:59:18] Jakodin: @Towelliee call the alt guild "Mallet Squad"
[20:59:27] BamfHoss: @Towelliee Does that guild have a raid schedule?
[20:59:30] itsChiliiii: Hammer Alt Squad LUL
[20:59:32] DingDongDean: @Towelliee Don't forget to get the Tabard of the Protector at the dark portal before it opens. You can get a cool tabard with an ability that does a holy nova animation.
[20:59:34] No_Panda: @Jakodin KEKW
[20:59:34] iTzPeytonTV: im lvl 5 on whitemane lets go
[20:59:34] SHREDDLOL: Im new to paladin, so is leveling with 1h + shield better than a 2h? @Towelliee
[20:59:36] AnubiS1690: they are forcing you to buy clones if you want to keep your name
[20:59:47] 69hdawg69: @lugawlord it doesn't start till level 20
[20:59:48] paravak: @AnubiS1690 ofc thats how it works, the servers are effectively the same as they were yesterday, all characters 'exist' on it, so if you create a brand new level 1 you can't give it a name when that char name is reserved. Otherwise players would steal each others names with level 1s before they chose to stay in classic and that would suck
[20:59:49] xRoughneck: @ilikegold123 all classic characters moved on to tbc classic now and if you wanna keep a character on one of the classic servers you need to pay to clone that characters.
[20:59:56] flanders61: anyone else stick with the black screens ?

[21:00:18] AveragePvp: @paravak i thought it was obvious too
[21:00:23] Chaoschef: is this early access?
[21:00:24] AnubiS1690: So i can BUY a clone, but not make a level 1 clone?
[21:00:28] AnubiS1690: how does that make sense
[21:00:36] Fate2k17: @Towelliee how much is the Character boost ?xd
[21:00:37] raisw: Does questie work for pre patch?

[21:01:04] louiszip: @AnubiS1690 makes sense to me dunno man
[21:01:05] paravak: Because you have the choice to keep that character, you're not forced to buy it at all

[22:19:27] einself111: @Raxxlian oh that is great news
[22:19:33] zinzerii: so is herb / skinning better then
[22:19:45] standardgandalf: In my opinion, yes
[22:19:49] karmakids: :(

[23:26:05] Navaeir: raid experience is definitely tons better in TBC.. attunement isn't that bad and also no world buffs

[23:26:36] 0x10f2c: @stevegodx So long and repetitive attunements only to 1 shot dungeons and raids is better?
[23:26:38] gooni_coyg: Do we have to use wowup for addons to work in TBC?
[23:26:43] Pannekaker: @shanksalenda, Not if you wanna play an alliance paladin

[23:37:40] coldhandsbeatz: I just hope they say they need 4-5 more hours. Its way better than extending it 1h 5 times
