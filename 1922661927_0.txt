[0:21:19] Molvonos: The Feat of Strength does not give you anything other than a 'I was here' sort of thing.  If that's making someone babyrage over FOMO, then there are deeper issues.
[0:22:01] abracka_: is chat malding over the secrets of azeroth mount?
[0:22:03] Rudric_Ice: @MykeCA mage tower ? AOTC ? Elite PVP sets ? Glad Mount ? there are prolly more
[0:22:41] abracka_: @Rudric_Ice mage tower is still there, just not the weapon appearances. AOTC lasts for literal months, same with elite pvp/glad mount
[0:22:58] MykeCA: Never once had any fomo oveer pvp mounts LUL. What you listed can be achieved in a timely manner. This is literally "you have some 24 hours or you miss out" nonsense.
[0:23:06] KaisenSiru: awkwHypedance
[0:23:31] MykeCA: People buy AoTC runs anyways.
[0:24:12] Rudric_Ice: @abracka_ and thats still fomo the duration doesnt matter it goes away at the end of each season which is fomo
[0:24:33] Molvonos: People need to get good if they're missing out on AOTC/Elite PvP stuff.
[0:24:49] MykeCA: imo, the duration does matter. You can make the decision of going for it or not. Not knowing about something and missing out on it is the definition of fomo

[0:26:43] Rudric_Ice: @abracka_ at the end of each expansion u get the mount so yea AOTC is fomo
[0:26:44] MykeCA: Hell, I only just started doing M+ for the 2k rating for the mount and I'm prob gonna get it before S2 ends LUL
[0:27:00] MykeCA: no it isn't LUL
[0:27:35] abracka_: @Rudric_Ice AOTC gives you that? i thought that only came with KSM/mythic sark
[0:27:36] MykeCA: if you aren't able to do aotc by the end of the season, you've actively made the decision to not go for it. Simply as that. That is not fomo.
[0:28:12] Rudric_Ice: ok dont complain about fomo then lmao
[0:28:26] abracka_: you're the one complaining about it?
[0:28:32] Molvonos: @abracka_ Oh, you right.  Myuthic Sark, KSH, or Elite Season 2.

[0:35:50] Caedranos: That big of a world, with dragonriding. Would feel like 3-4 normal zones

[3:04:52] RageerPLZ: I am hopeful though for somethign new, I have trouble enjoying raiding lately, though I will be here till I die already since Vanilla so might as well keep going but I would like to enjoy it for the most part.
[3:05:02] RageerPLZ: even if it's not 40, just some changes would be nice
[3:05:23] Morpheusx25: @RageerPLZ give raids more loot:P
[3:06:24] RageerPLZ: Yea that would be nice too.
[3:06:36] Molvonos: Why are changes necessary?  I don't understand, if something isn't broken, why 'change' it just for the sake of changing it?
[3:06:42] KingKoopa2165: We need them coins back for raid gear
[3:06:44] Molvonos: Aside from causing issues.
[3:06:48] RageerPLZ: the weak aura bosses oof
[3:07:06] Eshel: 40 just isn’t feasible anymore imo - be hard to fill except in rare circumstances
[3:07:44] Yagr6: Its the difficulty and the addons like on echo
[3:08:19] RageerPLZ: The number for me is just my take and what I would enjoy on it but I realize it's not the end all be all.  and this is just mythic raiding standpoint, heroic is fine to me.
[3:08:35] Eshel: Pugs have a hard time finding people for 2/3/9 - imagine needing 40 lmao

[3:29:37] Jaikenkai77: True i guess they only done it once so not that big of a deal :)
[3:29:37] KingKoopa2165: I just look at it as the amount of hours I spend on the game and what I would do for enjoyment off the game and how much money I would spend to do that.
[3:29:40] bigggtime: same reason they increase netflix, cause people keep paying it
[3:29:46] abracka_: most they can hope for with wow is expanded free trial
[3:29:52] cripplious: @Eshel itll be easy to do. it could be sponsored by fan duel
[3:29:53] kalamari__: I dont mean the sub, thats okay. I mean the prices for the account services
[3:30:02] Rudric_Ice: At least FF has a good trail
[3:30:09] Eshel: Go watch one movie - or play a month of WoW
[3:30:12] Noshpan: FFXIV does have the basic sub that's $12.99 USD
[3:30:14] Aidler: prices outside the US are often weird because some companies try to keep their US prices lower by rising them everywhere else
[3:30:22] Eshel: @cripplious  Lol
[3:30:22] cripplious: Disney+ bundle is going up to $19

[3:30:48] herzlustafir: goblins...
[3:31:20] Eshel: @proclicker  Netflix is a large percentage of foreign films now - can’t watch much without subtitles anymore
[3:31:25] Jaikenkai77: Have the expacs varied over the years or around the same ?
[3:31:49] abracka_: looks like it was always $30
[3:31:54] Jaikenkai77: Fair
[3:32:00] abracka_: for faction change*
[3:32:02] EurelDraan: Surely has? Because it has everywhere else I can't say for the US. But the UK everything has almost doubled apart from sub that has only got up by £2
[3:32:15] dracullus: also remember how fast is geting fresh char to max level currently, if nostalgia doesn't bound you moving char is completely pointless
[3:32:20] bigggtime: i feel like MOP was 40
[3:32:22] kalamari__: DF base is 60
[3:32:25] karaste: In 2013 at least, the faction change was $30
[3:32:26] Rudric_Ice: 70
[3:32:27] ashwing_: Expansions were much cheaper
[3:32:42] kalamari__: 10 more than SL
[3:33:13] Reaghol: it shoulda been free
[3:33:17] Reaghol: LUL
[3:33:18] dracullus: I think there was price increase in WoD and now in DF
[3:33:26] kalamari__: with these prices they really could give us a free month with it
[3:33:45] LearnedSomething: add 10% to get american

[3:34:47] tlsmith3638: when DF was on sale 2 months ago i about deluxe  for 20 bucks just to get the free month
[3:34:54] tlsmith3638: bought*
[3:35:28] Ghostopheles: coincidentally, thinking back on shadowlands is much like thinking back on covid

[3:35:49] dracullus: it was hyped on launch, people bitch about theme now when lack of patches was true problem
[3:35:50] Colt_Engineer: I hated those years. Both 2020 and 2021 flew by because I had to work all the time because I didn’t get covid while everyone else got sick and I had to cover for them.
[3:35:50] Zolshy89: THAT SYLV TRAILER DO
[3:36:10] cripplious: @Towelliee how are you liking starfield?
[3:36:11] Eshel: @tlsmith3638  That’s why I did the deluxe - when you subtract the $15 you’d pay anyway - it only cost $5 more
[3:36:12] vimie: SL had some WOTLK nostalgia at the start that helped
[3:36:15] tlsmith3638: back at the start of SL we thought BFA was bad and we thougth they cant have 2 bad xpacs in a row
[3:36:18] Zolshy89: this is coming from a player who played all of SL
[3:36:22] Zolshy89: even got Mythic portals in fated
[3:36:27] onikid89: well i had to work during covid so for me SL was mostly pass
[3:36:34] Ghostopheles: still have the thing up in warmode :)
[3:36:57] onikid89: tbh i enjoyed wod more than SL
[3:37:03] Zolshy89: that aint going to keep me from playing Lol

[3:46:56] Rudric_Ice: BELLULAR Pog
[3:47:14] Molvonos: @sgtswoll Uh.  You haven't seen almost all the other hunter tier sets then, apparently.
[3:47:30] Molvonos: lol, it's a WoW 'thing' to have shitty looking hunter sets.
[3:47:41] Rudric_Ice: shadowlands hunter sets was good
[3:48:00] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice That was 'mail' set, not hunter.  Same with BFA.  Those weren't Hunter specific.
[3:48:26] at1c: dungeon desgine could be done but a environment artist left and no one can take over it, that gets cut. (worst case scenario, most likely someone to get that work)

[3:48:31] Rudric_Ice: ahh true

[3:55:46] dracullus: I hope they change this rares to solo, no one is doing them currently
[3:56:31] D4rkArsenal: yah i saw your post i currently play on east coast and east coast has higher player base on live servers and so when those fresh starts merge into the old servers id rather be on a active region than dead
[3:56:47] Maylinn: Could barely see you in the chair, so I thought this was a vod lol
[3:56:52] Eggz1004: The rares definitely needed a health nerf, especially some of the ones in the reg zones released on launch
[3:57:04] bickkyy: Talking on the classic thing before, I personally dont see it going much past wotlk tbh too many classic andys hated cata and what it brought to the game

[3:59:13] ProClicker: People say Cata had the best arena
[3:59:29] xdishwashnx: Streamer are Just slaves to the Hype
[3:59:31] bickkyy: Do you think its just a hype wave every patch then? surely they wont just have 2 retail games going out along with hardcore. Wouldnt that split the player base up a heap?
[3:59:34] Aidler: the only one that’s maybe a bit weird is Quin LUL
[3:59:43] xdishwashnx: IT IS what IT IS
[3:59:52] at1c: Dragonflight is one of the best Wow expansions so far.
[4:00:03] bickkyy: Thats very true hahah
[4:00:07] dracullus: can't wait when retail will have more classic talents than current classic xD
[4:00:09] vimie: I liked Cata but wasn't a raider. The zones were fun & trying different stuff
[4:00:32] Noshpan: I cannot say if Dragonflight is one of the best, but it is one of the expansions I've enjoyed the most.

[4:53:08] chukudu: rogues tanking Gruul
[4:53:15] Nuggetttss: "You can do it!"
[4:53:19] KomsBoult: Still play DK for tanking though
[4:53:19] Molvonos: Yea, they had a few abilities that enabled them to pull threat if needed, but they werent tanks.
[4:53:33] LoNg_LiVe_RoLLs: Priest melee class and call it Cleric
[4:54:09] at1c: We lacked good aggro and needed more armour for it to work better, could blizzard make it happen? Sure. Will they? nah.
[4:54:23] Molvonos: @Brodih_ Nah, it really wasnt.  If that was the case, there'd have been more for that playstyle in the alpha/beta that got cut later, but that wasnt the case.

[4:54:26] Effin_Steffin: Mage Tank in Gruul's Lair
[4:55:00] Effin_Steffin: was it High King Maulgar that Mages tanked?
[4:55:12] Molvonos: @Effin_Steffin Mages/Warlocks tanked two of the adds.
[4:55:18] at1c: Warlock tanks in aq40 like its not unheard of, but that was designed for it.

[4:55:20] Molvonos: Mages had one, Warlocks the other.
[4:55:24] KomsBoult: I prefer the voice of Jaine in WOTLK time anyday of the week :)
[4:55:31] Effin_Steffin: @Molvonos True
[4:55:48] itsYoduhh: metamorphosis
[4:55:49] Molvonos: Most warlocks that had to tank went Destro, not Demo
[4:55:54] at1c: yep demon form
[4:55:56] Molvonos: Because of Searing Pain's threat mechanic.
[4:56:02] EurelDraan: Warlocks had their own Metamorphosis
[4:56:12] bloodygoblin42: metamorphosis
[4:56:20] itsYoduhh: dark apotheosis glyph from MoP to let demo locks tank was fun
[4:56:27] Rudric_Ice: bitch ass dh stole it
[4:56:46] itsYoduhh: yeah i don't see why demo locks can't still have it too :(
[4:57:25] Molvonos: I feel the only reason Warlocks got Metamorphosis was to test the waters for Demon Hunters.
[4:57:36] at1c: Good guy Towelliee here
[4:58:16] Molvonos: I personally couldn't stand the playstyle, lol.  I was either Affliction or Destro from Vanilla to current.
[4:58:17] Yaeger54: Then we got kanrethad as a legion companion, who could use meta. Was so mad :(
[4:58:29] at1c: AOE destro is stil think it plays clunky. lacks good flow
[4:58:37] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos disagree meta form for warlocks had much more depth than current dh meta form
[4:59:25] MackPlays: Ok Duke Nukage
[4:59:28] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice It had like, four abilities that got swapped out.  I wouldn't call that 'in depth'.  You went from being a single target ranged caster to a melee AOE  caster.
[4:59:45] mavericks312: AR15 looked pretty good yesterday
[4:59:46] itsYoduhh: i miss the cataclysm version of demo lock the most tbh
[5:00:06] Kitsunema: good ole forge of souls
[5:00:41] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos hey well at least it added something new other than the current dh form
[5:00:47] Nuggetttss: LUL y'all killed him.
[5:01:27] mavericks312: I ice block on that part of the fight every time lol ppl trying to kill each other
