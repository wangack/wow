[2:13:53] Gurtogg: yea the only people that care about the nerfs are mythic+ ppl
[2:13:54] PidiaP: They actually capped destro to 5 because 8 was too much still
[2:14:02] fillefaren: @Gbtwisted that affects the average playerbase aswell???
[2:14:06] HilariousMax: AoE capping EWW! NO! Boooo!

[2:15:34] NordicWolfie: I think AOE capping the legendary for survival hunters was a needed change, and i main hunter. It was too strong and 8 target is not a bad cap
[2:15:38] manmower: still a lot of xpac left for Shadowlands though

[2:17:02] Gravelode: wow music  is the best
[2:17:16] abracka_: 300k prize pool says a lot of people give a hoot about MDI

[2:28:23] Zakali: what is this account?
[2:28:28] HilariousMax: heirloom gear still worth after it got nerfed?
[2:29:25] shimwood: Just queue as Healer Kappa
[2:29:28] UndecidedPotate: Not in my opinion but if you dont need the gold, timewalking tokens, or whatever else its still something
[2:30:26] HilariousMax: Heaven forbid you go 40 minutes over. The community would not validate your run and you'll be shunned
[2:30:33] Everbliss: @Towelliee I know you get this a lot probably but - do you think current WoW is too reliant on add-ons for top end content?
[2:31:55] Everbliss: do you think it's a problem though?
[2:32:12] Connectus: Oooof can't wait for WotLK classic
[2:32:30] ijuki: AVR POGGERS
[2:33:08] HilariousMax: the thing about nostalgia is you'll never get what you're looking for back.

[2:33:27] Maneguster: I do not think i could play WoW with out bartender
[2:33:34] Connectus: @HilariousMax I prefer classic over retail currently, it's simply the better version gameplay wise for me personally
[2:33:40] Sylphy_TV: Leave my Bag addon alone chad LUL
[2:33:45] Connectus: But the retail dungeons and raids are awesome
[2:33:48] MILESkg21: RIGHT KEKW
[2:33:49] c0mmander_starscream: If Blizz banned "ADDONS" they would start a holy war on the forums lol
[2:33:50] swordart2022: Try it before you talk then
[2:33:55] swordart2022: Pilav proved it :P
[2:33:56] stratiss: I'd like to see to BigWigs and Weakauras go away. It's a massive barrier for new players.
[2:33:59] Tecni: What if blizzard integrated some of the addons into the game, like DBM and dps meter?
[2:34:00] LightBladeStream: @fairplay2021 Playing a max level rotation without weakauras is miserable
[2:34:01] Malnar1123: I have insane respect for top end players who dont use any major addons like WA or even Bartender
[2:34:02] SureSquire: @c0mmander_starscream KEKW Thats so fucking true
[2:34:06] Truthseeker96: bartender was huge for me back then i could never go without it
[2:34:07] Aidler: wow without addons isn’t the wow we know for 16 years now
[2:34:09] stallowned: for high end raiding u need boss timers lol
[2:34:24] swordart2022: @LightBladeStream i feel bad if you need for it

[2:35:26] xALcaPWNedx: i went back to alliance. bad choice, i know..
[2:35:32] reggiepowa: he said he could have joined method but dont want to raid that much
[2:35:41] SureSquire: I didn't start using addons til I was already Mythic dungeoning consistently, and even then they are a requirement at this point
[2:35:41] HilariousMax: all these boomers with their "in my day" nonsense lol
[2:35:43] Aidler: wow on console will be a completely different game
[2:35:46] RagingPunk: @Towelliee would you want player housing in wow?
[2:35:55] MILESkg21: console wow would have to be dumbed down way too much
[2:35:57] woohdakidd: woohdakidd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 95 months! 5 more months to the big 100. Thanks for keeping me entertained while I finish my masters.
[2:36:13] LightBladeStream: Why would you not use addons? They just enhance your experience massivly
[2:36:17] squidbubblez: why in your chat is rtwf a thing?
[2:36:21] LightBladeStream: With lots of personal customization
[2:36:28] SureSquire: I remember the surprise when Max saw a top 100 guild leader who was playing on a gaming laptop, and actually clicking his abilities with mouse 1
[2:36:37] nightmayor12: Not using addons is like not using a rubber, you don't want to, but you kinda have to.
[2:36:40] HawtPepperTuna: raid coordination would be ass wkthout addons
[2:36:48] squidbubblez: isnt that ui
[2:36:54] mmrghost7: i a happy with what ever the hell they do in 10.0 as long as there is no more god damn stat squish or level squish
[2:36:55] HilariousMax: "nice ui" KEKW
[2:37:08] dyslexican1: The best players in the world in PVP and PVE use them, just buy a clue. CAN you, yeah, sure, but SHOULD you in high-end content? No.
[2:37:17] SureSquire: I would love a build of WoW with an insane customizable default UI, but its just too deep in WoW culture at this point to work
[2:37:23] pereadin: yeahh
[2:37:26] stallowned: iv used default UI forever. just use WA/BW
[2:37:30] RagingPunk: i hope they update the talent trees but prob wont happen
[2:37:52] LightBladeStream: I do that, I just move my health bar to the middel of the screen next to weakauras
[2:37:56] ijuki: Just make a boss that is completely random... everything is random, health, damage, skills etc... that would be really funny Kappa
[2:37:58] Connectus: @RagingPunk don't know if they will, maybe another talent row at best :(
[2:38:10] deadman385: I think gingi plays default @towelliee

[2:38:42] manmower: once there is cross-faction, you can blame all the wipes on the one alliance guy
[2:38:42] PaPaBeaRCA: This is serious business no time to fuck around Kappa
[2:38:43] squidbubblez: gonna wipe fuck off
[2:38:52] ijuki: @Total193000 I win, they got their health to 0

[2:40:25] LightBladeStream: @Connectus If only we could get that AH in classic wow. Classic AH without addons is horrible LuL
[2:40:29] Kinghorn: oh yeah the xp gem forgot all about that
[2:40:30] HilariousMax: I imagine the Cloak has a clasp in the front

[3:01:15] pereadin: Unless its as close to a legion mirror as possible
[3:01:17] DrNox__: I dont care if its the best i just want a good one thats fun
[3:01:18] Broomba: @Densetsu_ so go ahead and unsub
[3:01:18] NewbNinja: Nah, they ain't beating lich king.  Not a chance.
[3:01:27] Evcon_: they are announcing the best xpansion tho.....wotlk
[3:01:29] Connectus: Curious what 10.0 will be
[3:01:37] Kneckt: @Towelliee did u see blizzard sent out a survey which included asking if we would like play to earn NFT's
[3:01:40] Connectus: But I'm probably sticking with classic
[3:01:48] Densetsu_: @Broomba Already am buddy 4Head
[3:01:55] HilariousMax: How can whatever comes next be better than WoD ? I mean, let's temper our expectations
[3:02:02] Alekty: Doesnt matter how good it is ya'll will find something to complain about because it's better content
[3:02:14] Broomba: Cool Story bro @Densetsu_
[3:02:46] iwhale_8: hey , after the new expa release , for new characters are we gonna lvl up in bfa like now or in shadowlands?
[3:02:58] Connectus: If they implemented covenants well it would've been fine. But they decided to implement it horribly which is simply sad FeelsBadMan
[3:03:00] Densetsu_: @Broomba No idea why you are upset? For someone hoping the expansion will be great.. kinda weird, but whatever.
[3:03:15] Kneckt: yeah its that one lol
[3:03:16] kashmara: nft.... nope
[3:03:16] swordart2022: Pog

[3:03:48] Broomba: @Densetsu_ lol who said i was upset....
[3:03:56] NewbNinja: They gotta find a way to inject new blood into this game, it's an amazing legacy but it's dying slowly but surely.

[3:04:44] kashmara: hey WoD gave me shitloads of gold until they fixed the garrisons >_>
[3:04:54] RagingPunk: much love towelie
[3:04:55] Connectus: tbh, WoD could've been a great expansion. But they cut like half the expansion out of it FeelsBadMan
[3:05:01] Connectus: Loved the idea, but executed poorly
[3:06:06] CrunkyBrewster: mmhmm
[3:06:08] Connectus: Until it gets scrapped MingLee
[3:06:13] Tharia: true
[3:06:18] Connectus: If a system isn't done, push it to next patch like FF XIV does
[3:06:23] Tharia: except islands was never a good idea
[3:06:41] mmrghost7: tbh i did like renown even when they announced it
[3:06:48] LehBiscuit: Still waiting on the dance studio SeemsGood
[3:06:49] Connectus: @Tharia tbh, could've been fun. But another poorly executed idea

[3:07:09] mrelgaato: !xp

[3:07:24] mrelgaato: !xpbar
[3:07:25] abracka_: 8 weeks later
[3:07:26] MisterRonB: meaningful choice?  like the Sylvanas' loyalist quest line?

[3:07:34] Gravelode: need kill all bosses for higher ilvl cond
[3:07:35] mizerboy: They need to bring back WF/TF
[3:07:41] bad00mojo: THank you
[3:07:47] Alienfromger: i sense some irony Kappa
[3:07:50] Truthseeker96: 8 weeks later plus nerfs and ppl rerolling. everyone is pissed
[3:07:55] RasmusAdrian22: this game is alive
[3:08:13] mmrghost7: @mizerboy agreed , they give purpoe to hc/normal raiding even weeks into patches
[3:08:18] mmrghost7: purpose
[3:08:22] aikopooh: but will ppl like it or not though
[3:08:25] Tokies: we did a meanful choice in bc if you were a crafter
[3:08:48] LightBladeStream: Didn't Preach say they had time in beta to fix azerite armor?
[3:09:05] Connectus: Blizzard: "We need to delay the game, it isn't finished"
[3:09:11] Connectus: Activision: "Yeah... But $$$"
[3:09:11] CrunkyBrewster: Agreed
[3:09:12] Connectus: Kappa
[3:09:16] CrunkyBrewster: you think you do, but you dont
[3:09:17] ijuki: My fault PepeHands
[3:09:42] nightmayor12: please bring back conduit energy
[3:09:58] mmrghost7: yeah that backfired
[3:09:58] CrunkyBrewster: EZ We gottem
[3:10:18] Malnar1123: I think it was more a vocal minority but blizzard took that noise of the minority and tuned out the majority because they were hearing what they wanted to hear from the minority
[3:10:29] jerexify: @Towelliee It was all an evil plan of retaliation against you evil streamers, see... All planned.
[3:10:31] MILESkg21: meaningful choice with punishment 4Head

[3:11:10] CrunkyBrewster: Yeah I really wanted to have stingy drop rates of cloaks and bracers
[3:11:11] Aidler: “you do what people need not what people want”
[3:11:17] Truthseeker96: well to be fair with nerfs and other classes clearing out playing other classes makes alot of players progress feel useless
[3:11:32] Truthseeker96: classes clearly *
[3:11:34] stresstest: Blizzard not wanting to acknowledge a shit idea and shit implementation
[3:11:35] Connectus: That's true, it was a majority
[3:11:39] aikopooh: @c0mmander_starscream how so  i not ganno lie, i used to play on private savers untill i found ff14
[3:11:44] Truthseeker96: there's gotta be balance
[3:11:59] SensationalBanana: Is John Height even with the team nowadays?
[3:12:08] EKS90_: I think meaningful choice sounded kinda fun when it got announced, but when i  played SL? yeah no.. quit kinda quick LUL
[3:12:25] Malnar1123: Tbf they also lied to us...they said they'd pull the ripcord and then when people said okay we've seen enough plz pull it they were like: Well actually it's more complicated than that.

[3:12:50] MILESkg21: way too much
[3:12:52] CrunkyBrewster: hence when I don't either of Classic or TBCC
[3:12:54] LehBiscuit: So many times in classic LUL
[3:12:55] Tharia: Tharia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months!

[3:12:58] GelatoCrow: +/+
[3:13:00] Shirey36: @51Nocaster they did pull the ripcord LUL
[3:13:02] GelatoCrow: yoooo
[3:13:03] N3llee: actually suprised to hear you being so vocal about the things you think they did wrong. Its refreshing honestly.
[3:13:11] HilariousMax: I'd died a couple time trying to time it KEKW
[3:13:31] Malnar1123: @Shirey36 Way too late...they talked in beta as though they could pull it in 9.0....
[3:13:34] c0mmander_starscream: Confirming when i play classic I want to feel like i'm back in 2005
[3:13:49] Gethrian: @towelliee but what about the people who play both retail and classic? Or like parts of both? Do you think blizzard can ever make them happy?
[3:13:55] Wheatmist: Wheatmist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[3:13:58] Broomba: @towelliee -- sticking to Elvui or going to transition to that new UI you tried a few weeks back?
[3:13:59] Connectus: @c0mmander_starscream hmm, why though?
[3:14:03] Malnar1123: The only part that I can't forgive them for was the blue post where they reversed everything they still maintained that they were glad people got to experience the original design...like we're so glad people experienced a pile of shit!
[3:14:15] geokouts: you will go to the ship later for a quest
[3:14:18] Connectus: I mean, I play classic because I prefer that version of the game. Not to go back to 2005 or 2007
[3:14:25] HilariousMax: "Do you think Blizzard can ever make their psychotic players happy" LOL
[3:14:36] BoezIRL: did you train the new riding?
[3:15:45] MILESkg21: Sadge
[3:15:50] net_mi: It's kinda funny how players and streamers think their feedback can force blizzard remove a game system which they put thousands of hours into developing. Blizzard will simply not let all this development-time go to waste

[3:16:32] duhworks: !event
[3:16:34] Connectus: I complain about retail all the time, still curious about 10.0 and probably will try it out. If it's horrible I just go back to classic
[3:16:34] Truthseeker96: they quit cuz they werent having fun
[3:16:40] Fulosophy: Ever think of a WoW 2?
[3:16:42] theSalute: SL was a skip for me xd
[3:16:45] EKS90_: even if i take months breaks during expansions, im always back for a release, its just what it is at this point @Towelliee LUL
[3:16:50] theSalute: I played tbc
[3:16:57] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee I just thank god Pearl Abyss doesnt own WoW
[3:17:01] Radiag: i unsubbed over half a year ago, still really looking forward to the next xpack, i just hope i enjoy it more than SL
[3:17:03] duhworks: what is 3k pushies chat
[3:17:05] SensationalBanana: If every person claiming not to play the game actually followed through, the game wouldn't break sales records every fucking expansion release. Kek!
[3:17:09] Shirey36: they always come back
[3:17:11] aikopooh: i played very heavy at shadowlands and not playing wow switched to ff14
[3:17:27] MILESkg21: @SensationalBanana True KEKW
[3:17:27] ItsEddieAU: haven't played wow since 2011 been thinking about coming back lol
[3:17:29] hatsihansu: @duhworks going for 3k m+ score
[3:17:37] smoochsmoochy: what level is he?
[3:17:40] c0mmander_starscream: I havent played Legion myself and I wont mention "Draenor"
[3:17:43] smoochsmoochy: and whyno heirlooms?
[3:17:45] Tharia: lol true I saw someone I'd not seen in about 7 years in game. that was more than a little surprise lol
[3:17:49] duhworks: @duhworks thanks
[3:18:08] Connectus: Played all WoW expansions, quit for the first time halfway through BfA because it was horrible
[3:18:22] aikopooh: i haven been wow sober for almost year and it was interesting ride
[3:18:33] Connectus: resubbed when classic launched, tried shadowlands and hated it. Turned back to classic after a couple of weeks
[3:18:35] EKS90_: I always play every expansion, for how long? who knows, but im still there every launch, even for classic and tbcc
[3:18:43] Shirey36: ppl cry bfa was bad....but was is it really? i came back to wow in bfa and enjoyed it
[3:18:45] mavericks312: i quit from mid legion till the end of bfa
[3:18:57] Malnar1123: 8.3 was great for players who stuck threough but coming back in 8.3 was ROUGH...took so long to catch up on cloak and other grinds
[3:19:00] Connectus: Legion was fun imo
[3:19:04] Tharia: same. I play it all and if I like it I play too much. if not, just here and there
[3:19:19] MILESkg21: BOB SALAMI PogChamp
[3:19:40] Radiag: @Shirey36 like with all bad wow expansions, there was quite a bit of good in it, it just had a lot of boring shit on top of it or systems that didnt quite work until a few patches in
[3:19:40] Connectus: The thing I like about classic atmo is I can do what I want without a huge chorelist to do first
[3:19:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[3:19:47] obbi87: @Towelliee You have played a fair bit of Lost ark. Most of the content i Lost ark, you "can" solo if you want. Do you think in wow, we need the option to Queue for more stuff. Like Rated PVP (Arena/RBG), M+ and so on? I see many people who purely play solo.
[3:19:49] Truthseeker96: legion was like the only expansion i actually played and didnt quit
[3:19:53] mrelgaato: wow music
[3:19:58] cliche_cat: amongus
[3:20:11] Connectus: Also being able to customize my character a lot more, there's simply more RPG mechanics that I prefer. The encounter design on retail though is nice most of  the time
[3:21:10] kashmara: bob salami :3
[3:21:28] EKS90_: Bwonsamdi is the best char to come out of BFA for me. love him
[3:21:50] Connectus: Bwonsamdi is awesome, love his char
[3:21:54] Tharia: this questline was pretty fun
[3:22:13] jkitchin75: @Biby07 yes
[3:22:19] Truthseeker96: I miss them 200% xp pots
[3:23:23] NispyCriblet: Kinda werid how he wasnt a boss in De Other Side
[3:23:40] Connectus: There's more customization in classic though, which is why I prefer it more
[3:23:50] Fulosophy: WoW is unique because it doesn't have those features.
[3:23:50] Snabido: what
[3:24:05] DeanoTV: more customization in classic? lol wat KEKW
[3:24:07] jkitchin75: sounds like king willy form predator 2
[3:24:17] raye_gaming22: how hard is it to give ppl dyes
[3:24:17] Connectus: @DeanoTV meme specs

[3:25:31] Snabido: Random M+ rewards wouldn't be killing bosses and trash for loot. It'd be doing a dungeon without being toxic to get your items

[3:27:01] Radiag: @Biby07 i guess thats more in the model design, they did add a lot more customization recently though, just not for something like height, or the classic boob size of asian mmos

[3:56:23] TomatoPhalanges: poor baine
[3:56:32] cudlsac: mending
[3:56:42] jpwastaken_: leveling i think camo is op for skipping mobs
[3:56:51] MisterBongwater: Cami is nice but I always pick tb
[3:57:16] dracullus: first BfA weeks were so good, I remember that I started Alliance alt week after launch and it felt like brand new expansion
[3:57:21] Aidler: what was wrong with TBC classic? you had high hopes for it..

[3:57:58] swordart2022: i think does not matter
[3:58:06] Snabido: Platform has skill training too
[3:58:44] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee If the next expansion is about Dragons then I want a playable dragonkin/dragonborn race and I will just play that forever going forward that's the one thing I want to see with the announcement.
[3:58:52] MILESkg21: D:
[3:59:13] Shrenko: not a fan of the zones in Wrath
[3:59:22] N3llee: how does someone ask about 9.3 with a straight face? Talk about someone so clueless
[3:59:23] SamAddams: Mop is the best expac because of ToT
[3:59:34] N3llee: @SamAddams hard no
[4:00:13] tepsi: !9TO5

[4:00:13] Aidler: for me Mop is also top… together with Legion 9.2
[4:00:13] wisplingz: 2 days now
[4:00:16] Horrorzi: is it worth playing WoW again ?
[4:00:24] plout0n: i don't play anymore, but for me WOTLK was GOAT
[4:00:26] wisplingz: timer got stuck :D
[4:00:36] tydrennistv: legion stil lnumber 1 Dh was the best new class added to the game. Pandera had the best story in my eyes
[4:00:37] plout0n: stopped during BFA
[4:00:59] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:00:59] Z3r0Fear: honestly Legion brought the one class that I wanted so bad back in TBC and that was Demon Hunters and honestly I've not been disappointed with what they produced looking forward to playing Classic Legion when that comes out and see DH be a beast again.
[4:01:09] Nazz_1138: that one flys
[4:01:11] Xanigh: the tiger can fly
[4:01:21] elanoira: teh tiger can fly
[4:01:21] hyboric: when lo flies
[4:01:25] dracullus: you literally ride flying mount
[4:01:39] swordart2022: yes
[4:02:09] TomatoPhalanges: am i misreading the timer or is it an hour off? timezones be wack for an aussie
[4:02:15] Snabido: Better start dancing on them mailboxes
[4:02:30] Z3r0Fear: its useful for getting over certain areas thats for sure
[4:02:39] Aidler: when you could simply buy flying
[4:02:41] Rexialiton: 60% flying in tbc.. that was slow lul
[4:03:13] dracullus: @TomatoPhalanges yeah it's 19:00 on europe right now and I think reveal will be 18:00
[4:03:19] PidiaP: By the time you unlock Shadowlands pathfinder I’m sure you’ll have the gold. You won’t unlock BFA pathfinder by the time you hit 50.
[4:03:22] Rexialiton: or w/e it was
[4:03:23] reggiepowa: you can't fly in bfa
[4:03:34] Shrenko: really? that sucks
[4:03:45] CYNIC308: hunters mark --> kill com --> serpent sting --> harpoon --> go crazy
[4:03:49] Shrenko: or tbh, not really because people should explore the zone their first time there
[4:03:52] fred_birkhoff: u should get 5000 gold by the time you finish outland if you grind it a bit and wotlk is where the big money comes in
[4:03:57] fred_birkhoff: but you need to quest
[4:04:15] fred_birkhoff: also, im talking about what i remember from like 10 years ago when i used to play lol
[4:04:16] reggiepowa: @shrenko it's not just exploring though, you need to farm reps for like a month
[4:04:23] DrNox__: Towelliee check if you can do chromie time now. I think i could do it after the bfa intro quest
[4:04:24] Snabido: Art of War is MoP
[4:04:27] Z3r0Fear: I hope they make the old zones relevant again.
[4:04:28] swordart2022: dont pick these
[4:04:30] ijuki: Art of war = MoP
[4:04:33] Carahail: art is for pandaland i think
[4:04:36] Shrenko: @reggiepowa ouch
[4:04:50] penqun: !9TO6
[4:04:54] Aidler: they need to do something for new people… it’s so tough to get into the game

[4:05:09] mavericks312: no one wants to quest in felwood or ashenvale
[4:05:18] Evcon_: i was doing ZA for the 11teenth day in a row and thought it would be a pretty good m+ dungeon
[4:05:21] swordart2022: Classic is for Nostalgia people :P
[4:05:22] Gabijtje: amen
[4:05:30] Paqyz: OH YES! Gimme Throne of Thunder Kreygasm

[4:06:00] imAskja: me

[4:06:24] TomatoPhalanges: I'd love to see what happened to these places since last visit
[4:06:27] plout0n: you're not an overly nostalgic person. Some people are.
[4:06:28] Zombie_Shark: all i want is for them to revamp the animation of the trees in those old places....
[4:06:31] Evcon_: then we can go into space and save other world souls
[4:06:33] autotune_wow: pray return
[4:06:35] MILESkg21: monkaS MAYBE
[4:06:39] Megladong: Dude i would love player housing
[4:06:47] raye_gaming22: oh god no no more garrison
[4:06:49] CYNIC308: hidden/chain quests can make old zones relevant
[4:07:01] TheRukis: they cant do player housing becuase this engine wont alow it to be done right
[4:07:01] CrunkyBrewster: Player Housing would certainly be a game changer if done right
[4:07:02] aikopooh: wow getting housing its not ganno happen like maybe couple of years
[4:07:04] Reign_69: Towelliee Knows things we don't

[4:07:35] Kazgrax: I miss Orgrimmar
[4:07:38] Ldysansa: When I play
[4:07:48] tydrennistv: honestly i just wish blizzard would add a msq system for new players. if you never knew wow lore and came into shadowlands you would be so confused on everything
[4:07:52] mavericks312: @Kazgrax ask a mage for a port
[4:08:00] Kazgrax: Lol
[4:08:03] Shrenko: Orgrimmar is ass, I play horde but Alliance capitals are so much better
[4:08:14] mmrghost7: poor rastakhan have no idea what will happen to him :P
[4:08:19] ijuki: @Shrenko Amen to that
[4:08:20] ashwing_: LUL Org
[4:08:22] Murry07: Please let there be action house
[4:08:22] mavericks312: UC > alliance hubs
[4:08:23] fred_birkhoff: cataclysm was my fav expansion cause it was modern enough to not have to fight the game but it wasn't too modern to the point you can play with a controller
[4:08:24] swordart2022: Anotehr flying city would be Pog
[4:08:28] Kazgrax: Horde 4 lyfe
[4:08:53] Hitokiri83: i like T&E's  idea for the nuetral capitol in making the wandering isle the capitol
[4:09:08] fred_birkhoff: i skipped WotlK unfortunately :(
[4:09:16] fred_birkhoff: maybe it would've been my fav too
[4:09:17] TheGiant99: IM actually thinking of starting over in Lost Ark
[4:09:19] stresstest: WotlK is definitely the start of modern wow
[4:09:29] swordart2022: Yuck
[4:09:35] Hitokiri83: panda starting zone
[4:09:35] swordart2022: you mean panda turtle ?
[4:09:38] Snabido: Back of a giant turtle 😏
[4:09:46] tydrennistv: increase gold cap to 100m
[4:09:50] TheRukis: yes
[4:09:58] swordart2022: DansGame
[4:10:02] dracullus: just.. why
[4:10:10] Snabido: It was monk's class order hall tbf
[4:10:24] Xanigh: it's pandaren starting zone, cool place but not a capital city
[4:10:24] stresstest: I mean it can move around , would be funny the capital is never at the same spot around the dragon isles
[4:10:28] Hitokiri83: his idea was that we ride the turtle to the dragon isle and start there
[4:10:33] zackyton: the annoucement is in 3 days?
[4:10:35] BattleKnoedel: I think its time to move dalaran again

[4:11:07] Pumpkinheadted: so should i start playing classic now or wait for wotlk ++
[4:11:11] Zombie_Shark: its so refreshing seeing all these people out and leveling in the world though
[4:11:20] lithium364: wandering isle was great, i hope if theres a new class it has its own starting area again

[4:13:19] manmower: dragon isles floating in the sky?
[4:13:29] TheRukis: wouldnt they need ot be farther away from azeroth?

[4:13:40] TheRukis: does sound cool though

[4:15:23] Holy_Z: they cant even make the world not lag to unplayable i doubt that would work well
[4:15:27] Milanesa_De_Pollo: It just sucks I have 50 characters in my account and have to delete one to level a Tinker

[4:17:16] mavericks312: imagine thinking were getting a new class at all
[4:17:19] tino49: if there's any new bullshit system like conduits im not even buying dragonflight

[4:17:51] Connectus: We all know the new class is going to be necromancer Kappa
[4:17:53] Snabido: Closest bard in wow rn is Brewmaster handing out brews
[4:17:54] Funderik: tinkers... dark rangers... why not void paladins
[4:17:56] Exxcar: They already know balancing the current classes isn't an easy task. they aren't going to make it harder by adding another one

[4:18:04] swordart2022: @tino49 dont buy then simple as that 4Head
[4:18:07] VICI0US_TV: @towelliee having trouble deciding to main a mo k or druid tank, any thoughts
[4:18:09] UnholyDMC: i hope they are a healer/dps/tank trispec that way they can fill slots
[4:18:13] Ortinoth: that is if there is a new class introduced but the 50 character cap per account still needs to be removed

[4:18:22] ashwing_: LUL
[4:18:29] UnholyDMC: i didnt really like demon hunter tanking tho
[4:18:31] Holy_Z: yall thinkin theres gonna be a new class Jebaited
[4:18:42] NoWaayMan: you are killing independent George!
[4:18:43] tydrennistv: you should get a swift spectral tiger
[4:18:44] dyslexican1: Im fine with whatever new system they will intorduce. i JUST want it to be consistant, and to build on its self logically, and be implamented well.... thats all I ask for.
[4:18:51] UnholyDMC: i wonder if they'll get an ability we'll se every DP{S rotation like demon hunter eye beam
[4:19:07] MILESkg21: already gone 2 expansion without a new class so ??
[4:19:21] UnholyDMC: i really wanted to see naga and murlocs as playable
[4:19:28] UnholyDMC: but vashjr was so hated lol
[4:19:36] Draethar: I'm hoping for a new class I need something FRESH!

[4:19:56] TakMaggy: F
[4:19:59] CYNIC308: Zombie-T-Rex INC~!
[4:19:59] Reign_69: I think if there's a new class, it'll be a dragon knight, It'll be like a warrior, but using dragon like abilities, you won't need a flying mount cause you'll transform into a dragon similar to the Dragonwrath Legendary staff, and it'll be a Tank, Heals, and Dps class
[4:19:59] KrakenVenom: NOT DINO-DADDY
[4:20:05] VICI0US_TV: im thinking I'm gonna level a monk brewmaster
[4:20:07] Mallaes: BibleThump Rezan

[4:20:16] TickleMeHulk: if the new class was a bard what would you like to see?
[4:20:19] dracullus: Zul was better villain than Jailer.. here I said that
[4:20:24] UnholyDMC: brewmaster monk is such a convenient lfg tank class
[4:20:31] manmower: i think the BFA dungeons were a bit better than SL ones
[4:20:37] UnholyDMC: tossing kegs is kinda like applying pestilence as a DK for agro
[4:21:02] Draethar: I hope it's like a Dragon Warrior or something even mail wearer... 2/3 hero classes were edgy but they all were really cool even the monk has its charm.
[4:21:04] UnholyDMC: and the falme breath combo is just so cool

[5:10:17] UnholyDMC: AngelThump
[5:10:18] UndecidedPotate: Turned into a torghast catchup mechanic
[5:10:20] Taz_85: BUT there was that theory, rumor or whatever about the AU Light Garrosh, with Yrel
[5:10:22] Ortinoth: well arthas still remains - just a spec of soul
[5:10:26] Emirbt: unfortunately garrosh and arthas are completely lost forever
[5:10:35] UnholyDMC: bolvar was cool
[5:10:37] richardmu: varian is not ash. He's still in Torghast
[5:10:41] UnholyDMC: too bad he got owned in a cutscene
[5:10:48] Shugnight: @Towelliee how much longer are you streaming today?
[5:11:29] UnholyDMC: i saw someone make a meme of why he lost in the cutscene too
[5:11:34] Taz_85: WoD Grom had a kid, too, apparently. Not sure if it was confirmed

[5:11:44] Taz_85: Could be a lady Garrosh
[5:11:46] ShleppyGaming: What’re you seeing
[5:11:52] TheCliffyShow: Garrosh might have been an asshole, but he went out like a boss.
[5:11:53] UnholyDMC: like he's the leader of the army of the dead
[5:12:03] UnholyDMC: and they just "showed up too late" LOL
[5:12:09] Taz_85: Grom. He was old as fuck when we saw him again in BfA

[5:12:59] TheCliffyShow: Just filling in a plot hole. And, introducing Salandria.
[5:12:59] Taz_85: Think they get another mount, too
[5:13:00] UnholyDMC: i'd imagine the scourge being like the scarlet crusade
[5:13:11] TheCliffyShow: Well, reintroducing her.
[5:13:11] mavericks312: is the scourge even a thing now with no lich king/jailer?
[5:13:29] reformedalex12345: i hate what SL did to LK there must be always be a LK and now "never again will lich king rule in icecrown" LUL
[5:13:37] Taz_85: It's cool that the dark iron dwarves are getting a questline with some of their heritage weapons, but I wish it was more than just a staff, shield and axe
[5:13:39] mmrghost7: i wanna see new healer DK  spec
[5:14:07] UnholyDMC: yo dawg wanna do some evil stuff?
[5:14:09] Nokterian: @Taz_85 you get a new mount as well

[5:15:11] Ortinoth: i am still against the ending of alliance and horde eternal war
[5:15:17] TheCliffyShow: The Scourge is like the Twilight's Hammer. They will never be truly gone.

[5:17:48] UnholyDMC: idk tho i kinda like shadowmeld
[5:18:08] UnholyDMC: easy agro drop to mount while questing

[5:19:58] TheCliffyShow: Getting rid of racials would be lame.
[5:19:58] stratiss: thatll cost a tier
[5:20:01] shankeltons: All I want is a focus back on azeroth. Maybe update the old zones one at a time as we do a story tour around azeroth to set the tone going forward

[5:21:27] rymerre: there better be a class
[5:21:27] Ortinoth: no new ones
[5:21:28] swordart2022: @SauceFu not a lot except some esport and mdi junkies
[5:21:29] mmrghost7: no classes is gonna bring some rage
[5:21:35] Ludicruz: it is highly doubtful that they will add a new class.
[5:21:38] Reign_69: It'll be a dragon knight, or a new dragon race
[5:21:38] MILESkg21: DARK RANGER SwiftRage
[5:21:41] UnholyDMC: allied races makes adding more races easy tho
[5:21:46] Alittlegeeky: new classes? man, just give me good transmogs in raids pls
[5:21:47] lucid_wow: i hope theres no new class tbh, they already have a hard enough time balancing the specs they already have
[5:21:48] deeerow: going to be more unblaances
[5:21:49] Two_Headed_Raven: Banshee class :P

[5:22:08] mmrghost7: add new specs atleast  ?
[5:22:15] c3llout7: Do you think they will give us a big cinematic for the cross Faction play?
[5:22:17] MILESkg21: nothing but DPS/Tank since WOD
[5:22:17] marcuusjj: prob new race
[5:22:18] sycnessx: yeah, we need a ranged tank who can heal and go invisible - should fix everything
[5:22:19] Friiz_The_Gamer: fuck it...i want another....new classes are fun
[5:22:31] captiv8: a new class would be awesome.  you may complain but you will make one
[5:22:35] Reign_69: Or just re-design the specs already in the game
[5:22:36] gooni_coyg: called the Dragon Hunter
[5:22:39] lucid_wow: also maybe an unpopular opinion but it feels like mechanically the classes already in the game kinda cover everything and they couldnt really add a new class without gutting current specs kinda like demo getting shafted when dh came out
