[3:23:50] JC_officiel: @infrex1 what error text are you talking about ?
[3:23:51] Fiskerz: or if that = cheating
[3:23:51] demongodxtv: why because he pressed it once?
[3:23:58] Dokkotter: @demongodxtv nah true shinta isnt ahking, he's just using a different client to everyone else OpieOP
[3:24:11] infrex1: @infrex1 "target out of range" etc red text
[3:24:14] mathematician3: lmao, shinta is 100% using AHK just tune in right now, perfect globals LUL
[3:24:22] godreazy: just look at button presses dont need to error text every normal player spams keys shinta always smooth globals just like torsten
[3:24:30] Fiskerz: @demongodxtv have you played the game? Spells don't work like that lol. You can see that the error text gets spammed that he isnt' able to do that yet.

[3:35:55] Eonx: afaik from watching that matchup you don't spam sacreds and the warrior has to help you get plea by kiting away
[3:36:01] Eonx: they just want to hold down W so
[3:36:12] Fiskerz: @vbx93 only 10 yrds which hes probably in since they W towards him
[3:36:47] prodijftw0: I used to raid semi seriously with a french guild years back, They would wipe on a boss at 80% hp then be like "oh X person didnt have a flask" and have a discussion about it
[3:37:31] prodijftw0: Could stand it after a while, over analyze random things
[3:38:00] Fiskerz: don't think hes totally wrong but also hes taking way more dmg if hes not using sacred

[3:49:32] shucoco: Vindication, seal of vengeance stacks and shit. Dispelling plague is not a easy thing
[3:49:37] Fiskerz: yeah, prob is though they can just swap war so they kinda get free reset
[3:49:47] Fiskerz: i mean priest not following and making him line
[3:49:55] braphlol: you can only hit one target because of pom bounce, and priest has to be slowed always. hard to comitt to ret while spamming howl on priest because hamstring will bounce the pom
[3:49:57] Fiskerz: so war has to stay out and priest heals for free kinda
[3:50:13] Dokkotter: u shut them completely down by going ret, the priest will not constantly push for burns and ccs with double slow and pressure on the ret. Mby im completely wrong.
[3:50:32] Dokkotter: The reaction ive had vs every ret disc is they eventually have to fuck off behind a pillar and regen
