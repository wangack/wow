[2:48:30] creepywalker: i never decline a hunter a BM always deliver lol
[2:49:01] yohananya: zaelia playing aug :o?
[2:49:04] Dynender: bm is like easiest dps spec ive played by far
[2:49:11] Radsol54: BM hunter is the easiest class to play
[2:49:13] creepywalker: even an average BM as gingi can do good dmg i mean u have to invite them
[2:49:16] Radsol54: its not even close i feel like
[2:49:22] Dynender: @Radsol54 agreed
[2:49:25] rezthumb: Does mage need lots of gear to be good? I feel like im really far behind eveyone
[2:49:28] moewe11: @Radsol54 u tried ret pala already?^^
[2:49:35] lebduch: I feel like retri is even easier to be fair :D
[2:49:48] ireallydontlikesushi: Sup beast mode hope youre doing well
[2:49:49] Radsol54: i am not a melee dps player, ive done everything else
[2:49:50] tvilk: balance, destro and BM are the 3 easiest classes in the game by far
[2:49:53] ster1233: what do u think about enhancement rn?
[2:49:54] moonboom89: destru is way more punishing than demo though
[2:49:58] zerossussy: as braindead boomie is right now, bm is still more braindead
[2:50:01] Dynender: after maining outlaw rogue since shadowlands i can play bm hunter with 1 hand and its amazing
[2:50:03] biddlybee: @tvilk add guardian druid to that list as well
[2:50:10] tvilk: Destro losing Madness of the Az'aqir made them 100% the easiest class in the game
[2:50:18] creepywalker: i dont like the fact boomie is ramp up
[2:50:19] tvilk: destro has no skill cap
[2:50:20] unholyhoit: destro is fun until the tank moves the pack away KEKW
[2:50:27] RaxxFPS: Aint no way something is easier than BM LMAO
[2:50:27] creepywalker: i like burst others then that boomie is fun tho
[2:50:32] Radsol54: guardian is way harder than BM hunter imo, and thats not saying guardian is hard, just BM is that easy, imo
[2:50:34] ReSeT_VT: @lebduch ret isn't that easy compared to BM, you can't just karate chomp your CDs
[2:50:37] zerossussy: destro is nowhere as easy as bm hunter xdd
[2:50:45] zerossussy: its not even close
[2:50:49] zerossussy: bm is braindead completely
[2:50:52] tvilk: yeah destro is way easier
[2:51:00] biddlybee: truthfully though, how many 'hard' classes are there actually to play in wow, its a lot simpler than other games
[2:51:06] zerossussy: @tvilk ? xdd
[2:51:09] Dynender: unholy is so fun but no one likes it anymore
[2:51:17] moonboom89: destru is sick on big pulls with cds, but if someone pulls like one pack at a time in keys, then its rip
[2:51:20] creepywalker: @biddlybee explain arcane mage plx
[2:51:24] RaxxFPS: @Dynender It's to cluncky to play imo
[2:51:28] Radsol54: @GingiTV and chat, hardest dps classes to play?
[2:51:30] RaxxFPS: Doesn't have a good feeling to It
[2:51:31] Naowh: nice level
[2:51:36] Dynender: @RaxxFPS i really enjoy it
[2:51:38] creepywalker: @Radsol54 arcane mage
[2:51:41] Radsol54: @Naowh a GOAT has entered the chat
[2:51:43] creepywalker: @Naowh hi average tank
[2:51:44] unholyhoit: @Naowh big key
[2:51:45] teramil: @Dynender probably because it isn't good and they are not represented enough, dps dk is kinda dead
[2:51:48] zerossussy: @Radsol54 keep it rolling outlaw
[2:52:01] Naowh: im gna be a god tank now, turns out the apartment had a herman miller chair
[2:52:06] Dynender: @teramil yah its a shame
[2:52:06] Naowh: no mobs can now break my back
[2:52:07] biddlybee: @biddlybee havent playd since last xpac but I imagine its still just arcane blast, some kyrian ability, missiles and explosion if you're feeling exotic
[2:52:08] RaxxFPS: @Dynender Ye I mean, It's probably fun to some extent but It just feels very clunky to play. Same with enchance sham, just clunky.,
[2:52:08] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[2:52:11] ReSeT_VT: @Radsol54 the one in my group that's always dead and doing 0 dps, sometimes its DH,sometimes its  BM
[2:52:15] Radsol54: @Naowh EZ
[2:52:25] zerossussy: @Naowh project > echo inc?
[2:52:27] chaosfangx: @Naowh is back
[2:52:30] chaosfangx: send it
[2:52:30] Dynender: @RaxxFPS i can agree there
[2:52:36] Radsol54: i agree with the arcane mage response most
[2:52:47] Radsol54: Arcane mage is the hardest/most punishing, certainly in keys
[2:52:49] Radsol54: to me
[2:53:14] Radsol54: enhance is really hard too isnt it?
[2:53:14] teramil: arcane aoe is so easy tho
[2:53:26] Dynender: outlaw is the hardest i played
[2:53:26] RaxxFPS: Most casters are harder to play than melee imo, casters usually require some type of degeneracy to be really good at It
[2:53:37] biddlybee: arcane mage has more buttons at level 25 in SoD than it does at 70 in retail
[2:53:38] unholyhoit: mdi strats :D
[2:53:45] teramil: i agree with keep it rolling outlaw and enha being the hardest ones, and assa
[2:53:45] creepywalker: ret and bm give the most in return to how easy they are, i mean some buttons and giga dmg
[2:53:55] barniboo: outlaw is harder then enhancement shaman?
[2:53:56] Prime_Rage: outlaw probly most difficult to play
[2:53:57] toyfluffy: especially when you play EB and keep it rolling
[2:53:57] ReSeT_VT: @creepywalker demo xdd
[2:54:09] aavegotchi1221: @barniboo enha is hard?
[2:54:13] creepywalker: ye demo is in that aswell prolly:D
[2:54:19] ReSeT_VT: demo has like 4 buttons, but clicking them in the correct order is harder than other specs
[2:54:24] MoonmeanderTheKing: enhancement isnt that hard when you got the muscle memory
[2:54:24] Prime_Rage: enha not that hard
[2:54:36] XadrOwO: what spec has the highest apm?
[2:54:40] ReSeT_VT: fury
[2:54:42] aavegotchi1221: outlaw for sure
[2:54:42] creepywalker: outlaw?
[2:54:43] tvilk: @XadrOwO fury warrior
[2:54:44] ireallydontlikesushi: I quit doing keys after shadowlands to play ironman on osrs GIGACHAD
[2:54:45] Radsol54: Aug
[2:54:49] ReSeT_VT: oh yea fury or outlaw
[2:54:50] EazzyBreezzy: @ReSeT_VT you click? HUH
[2:54:50] teramil: @XadrOwO fury and outlaw for sure
[2:54:53] Prime_Rage: outlaw yep
[2:54:57] Radsol54: if you play Aug at its ceiling, its the hardest spec imo
[2:55:01] Radsol54: the most things to do
[2:55:02] druggie12: what does it mean apm?
[2:55:07] mieko29: @ireallydontlikesushi GIGACHAD 2277 total
[2:55:08] XadrOwO: actions per minute
[2:55:08] rezthumb: can you play the ignite fire mage build outside of mdi level keys?
[2:55:09] Dynender: actions per minute @druggie12
[2:55:11] EazzyBreezzy: @druggie12 actions per minute
[2:55:15] RaxxFPS: Enhance is by far the shittiest feel spec I have ever played, I raided with It in vault and wanted to kms. It's not that it's hard, just setting stuff up take ages before you get going my zugzug brain couldn't comprehend
[2:55:16] Radsol54: you are a pseudo healer/dps/surviving is active
[2:55:20] tvilk: @XadrOwO outlaw GCD is capped whereas fury's GCD is affected by the GCD
[2:55:35] creepywalker: fury is looking cool tho
[2:55:41] tvilk: @XadrOwO by haste**
[2:55:42] barniboo: @aavegotchi1221 yea spreading lava lash debuff, the apm and the new tier set is kinda difficult to time
[2:55:46] creepywalker: bashing around with 2 big axes is insane:D
[2:55:52] Dynender: i stopped playing outlaw now that its s tier so sad
[2:56:00] zerossussy: @tvilk every energy class is capped on gcd btw
[2:56:16] Seatz147: HUH
[2:56:28] Prime_Rage: sadge no trinket
[2:56:37] wertkopf: So hunter/dh/rogue for MDI?
[2:56:39] creepywalker: i swapped to BM cause its easy :D
[2:56:43] xxrecneps: the trinket doesnt exist LUL
[2:56:51] EazzyBreezzy: is arcane as complicated to pick it and it appears to do "decent" in keys?
[2:56:51] ireallydontlikesushi: the trinket is a lie
[2:56:56] ReSeT_VT: according to sims, tanks have the most apm due to out of GCD spells. it would be prot pala > prot warr
[2:56:59] chadderz7: xdd
[2:56:59] creepywalker: as a Melee i die so often:D

[2:57:18] Aethad: survival key??
[2:57:21] ireallydontlikesushi: all of my healers also have a bm hunter :)
[2:57:30] RaxxFPS: If you truly want a spec with a shit ton of buttons and stuff to do. Play resto druid. It's crazy how much stuff you have If you do high keys as cat.

[2:58:52] toyfluffy: i mean its 486 so it should be 45 imo
[2:59:01] unholyhoit: it's the same as last season

[2:59:14] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[2:59:15] unholyhoit: but at least last season it was a max level item
[2:59:29] kawakhshami: hey @GingiTV what do you think about unholy dk's in m+ ? Are they that bad ? should i reroll for it from holy paladin ?
[2:59:30] Moobot: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[2:59:48] toyfluffy: @unholyhoit thats actually not true, it was even lower than this season compared to max ilvl
[3:00:11] RaxxFPS: DAYUM
[3:00:14] RaxxFPS: big trapper
[3:00:19] unholyhoit: max ilevel from myth track was 447, crafted gear was 447
[3:00:25] othernewname: it costs 60  aspects cause it goes 3 levels higher than HC gear. For  HC gear u need 45 Aspectcrests
[3:00:27] ReSeT_VT: @toyfluffy  is that true?
[3:00:27] Dynender: @kawakhshami ive been maining unholy dk this season and its fun. u can do massive damage on big pulls and satisfying but thats about it
[3:00:28] RaxxFPS: he's so proud doesnt want to admit it
[3:00:46] cosmin284: take care  everyone have the best amazing fantastic happy new year 2024 and a awesome day and night fuegoL fuegoH <3
[3:01:04] kawakhshami: @Dynender so unholy is all about the trash dmg and nothing more ?
[3:01:24] Hnbo: I cant decide, whether i should tank on my pala or dk?
[3:01:27] Dynender: @kawakhshami single target isnt bad either. but yes it really shines in big packs
[3:01:54] RaxxFPS: MDI double UH in Everbloom trust me

[3:48:40] stentoftt: Kinda mid
[3:48:41] Laco035: nice season but hate waycrest
[3:48:43] Jasbie: Dungeons are alright but I aspect farming is dog
[3:48:47] ReSeT_VT: dungeons are great, very small nitpicking things could be improved but very good otherwise

[3:48:49] aavegotchi1221: S1 > S3 > S2, s2 worst
[3:48:51] gergrunt: still fed up with stuff like sanguine and afflicted tho
[3:48:56] dethbybunnies: omega kick heavy dungeons
[3:48:59] creepywalker: the fact people skip joining your key when its : rise / everbloom /tott and maybe even fall says enough
[3:49:00] daftna: I'm bored of tyrannical and fortified. I wish affixes were tied to specific dungeons instead of for all of them
[3:49:03] toyfluffy: im happy with the balancing of the classes, but imo the hp pool  for dungeons is too low
[3:49:03] thebrisket49: they dungeons are challenging and arent a push over so most people dislike them lol
[3:49:08] nine_out_of_ten: EB burst tho, not a fan. Bolstering as well, if ppl don't focus wasps.
[3:49:16] NiSMOtv: they need to nerf Rise I cant even complete +26 with 5 death
[3:49:26] pj_sthl: thought i just feel affixes ruins the game rn
[3:49:27] certose: Rise fuckin blows

[3:49:36] Der_Selli: having to play vdh in order to be able get this is verry bad imo
[3:49:37] xo_navi: M+ needs a rework and not just removing the terribly annoying stuff like they have been
[3:49:37] greatangelsanguinius: @NiSMOtv skill issue
[3:49:40] licoppemusic: too many random target cast mobs imo
[3:49:45] moewe11: @pj_sthl than the dmg is giga low i saw it on 27 with 24 deaths timed^^
[3:49:47] thekbk: thekbk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:49:48] ReSeT_VT: rise timer, EB ondeath, BRH small bois that spin are a few weird ones
[3:49:49] TheHunter90: guyss
[3:49:49] jothell: almost every dung has so hard bosses
[3:49:53] NiSMOtv: @greatangelsanguinius I agree
[3:50:11] zaradel_plays: Andy says prot pala is more than viable after last weeks keys.
[3:50:21] zaradel_plays: not just VDH
[3:50:36] TheHunter90: guys, one important question and i really need an answer.When the legendary dropd do you automaticaly learn the tmog axe or you have to do the whole grind?
[3:50:36] linguinetoes: Just don't overlap interrupts Kappa
[3:50:38] moewe11: @zaradel_plays both are strong dh a bit more controll and dmg prot survive more
[3:50:40] strafeeow: FeelsThinkingMan mhm mhm FeelsThinkingMan
[3:50:41] ReSeT_VT: OK, based opinion: it's not the hard bosses being an issue, but how easy the other ones are
[3:50:52] VelhoAcE: BM hunter is so braindead that gingi is playing with 1 hand x'D
[3:50:55] xo_navi: FeelsTastyMan what
[3:51:00] greatangelsanguinius: @VelhoAcE lmao
[3:51:10] NastieTV: prot pala is also nice group utility in form of bops, cr offheals, dispells and whatnot and alot of interrupts in shields
[3:51:30] xo_navi: have you seen the cheese for this boss? I know this is just a 20 but it's nuts
[3:51:34] xxrecneps: the hardest part of being bm is being assigned every single boss mech in raid
[3:51:37] Thoreya: gingi so skilled one handed
[3:51:38] unholyhoit: chains > silence > nova > silence > chains > pack is dead KEKW
[3:51:51] ReSeT_VT: just relax your right hand yes

[3:52:06] unholyhoit: or chains > silence > nova > silence > fear sigil > chains > fear sigil KEKW
[3:52:07] ReSeT_VT: hardest BM encounter
[3:52:23] Menethrill: BM hunter EZ
[3:52:24] zennylock: every class can be played one handed lol
[3:52:28] VelhoAcE: if you have 2 hands, you can play 2 BM hunters at the same time
[3:52:32] Spirit_GamingTV: @unholyhoit dont forget opressing roar from evoker XD it turns silence into a 10 sec silence
[3:52:34] viribus1unitis: dh tank gets evrything that they missed designing for other classes
[3:52:38] Thoreya: @zennylock well thats not true
[3:52:39] greatangelsanguinius: @zennylock At different effectiveness
[3:52:41] ReSeT_VT: oh that's a pull
[3:52:49] jurashh: chaos, silence, grip, fear the list goes in its crazy
[3:52:52] Masterkdz: @VelhoAcE you can play all classes with one hand only ^^
[3:52:59] ReSeT_VT: xdd

[3:53:54] Kilevinken: I dont get why people play the house either, maby my previous route was offmeta lul
[3:53:55] marcofellipe69: he lives in there like a beast
[3:54:13] ReSeT_VT: poor dorki catching strays

[3:54:46] Menethrill: KEKW
[3:54:49] unholyhoit: rip
[3:54:51] Masterkdz: @viribus1unitis you got so many binds that it requires 2hands on the keyboard? if you talk about having to change target for some reason with the mouse, actually hunt bm needs as well cause of the multidotting 4p ^^ but on ST you can, with a rogue, let the mouse out of your hand ahah
[3:54:58] Destinyclass: are you pushing this week or chilling?
[3:55:00] xo_navi: there's a waygate skip behind the house
[3:55:05] xo_navi: but it's kind of hard to place it
[3:55:18] ReSeT_VT: I've seen a skip done by a mount
[3:55:23] ReSeT_VT: to 3rd boss
[3:55:28] ReSeT_VT: no gate or dh bullshitt
[3:55:34] ReSeT_VT: i think it was on wow daily
[3:55:49] Blaknwyt: thought that one had been fixed? have to go check it
[3:56:18] Masterkdz: @ReSeT_VT yes it's an old skip (WoD time) but you skip a lot of packs actually doing so, you need the %
[3:56:19] unholyhoit: is a no abomination route possible in everboom?
[3:56:29] Blaknwyt: @unholyhoit yep
[3:56:40] unholyhoit: those are so much fun in bolstering
[3:56:49] druggie12: @unholyhoit i think there is route wher you take only 11 bomi on first puoll then skip others
[3:56:55] Yesidid480: Y u no rank 1 gingi? Talk to me wen rank 1!
[3:56:57] druggie12: 1"
[3:56:59] Blaknwyt: does need, invis/shroud/gate

[4:00:29] NastieTV: yeah, unless its to high because hunts wont survive :(
[4:00:34] Masterkdz: since it's even less tanky than a boomkin
[4:00:46] jackyt0n: hunter is fine, just squishy
[4:00:52] Justflux: @Masterkdz fake news

[4:04:36] Marts1: who are you guys gearing for?
[4:04:43] NastieTV: In 25+ keys the hunter in our group as real trouble surviving, many times as the only ranged aswell which means they get alot of targeted stuff on them. Would it be worth to have like a vers set or something or would they loose to much damage from that?

[4:11:39] garoundar: there is no way 1m is 50euro right now

[4:21:10] restobae: `why is a weakaura that shows put auto cast needed?
[4:21:32] Rehax: @restobae because you use a macro that turns off auto attacks during SV's cooldown. you need to reenable it manually then
