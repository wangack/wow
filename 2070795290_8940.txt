[3:12:33] NuketheFreakinWeak: 0-5 depends on affix tier
[3:12:34] avlok_: yes
[3:12:34] shinnanigens: Tiers
[3:12:37] funboix0x0: I'm always High
[3:12:39] psylome: affixes that you want
[3:12:41] aresden3: if its tier 5 its chance to get 0-5
[3:12:42] dontrez69: Look for dolans blade
[3:12:42] Landiun: it would give you a portion of them, but high tier or high value affixes
[3:12:43] TECA_btw: usually rare affixes are better to shatter
[3:12:44] Landiun: you should
[3:12:49] saxraptor: your filter marks those items with bold red
[3:12:51] TECA_btw: like skill specific ones
[3:12:53] Landiun: you can also use removal to get full value
[3:12:53] Envious262: use removal over shatter
[3:12:55] Envious262: gives more shards
[3:12:57] Landiun: yo ucan buy them from a vendor
[3:12:59] psylome: common enough that you fuckin buy em
[3:13:00] aresden3: very common. u can buy in shop
[3:13:00] 4shizzyy: not insanely rare
[3:13:04] Landiun: i actually know
[3:13:05] Landiun: rofl
[3:13:05] Shotist25: you can buy 5 from a vendor every town
[3:13:06] psylome: he's just typing shit
[3:13:07] avlok_: You can buy half a dozen every time the shop refreshes for 2k each @sneakylol
[3:13:09] meowdge: you can buy em from person
[3:13:10] Shotist25: it's good practice to do so
[3:13:12] Aldavael: shatterings arent rare but you need a fuck ton
[3:13:14] funboix0x0: Landi is a day 1 knower
[3:13:17] MyDriftingShip: guides that I see say buy all shatters from vendors if you can
[3:13:17] saxraptor: pull up your filter
[3:13:19] RisaGayle: caughtTrolling
[3:13:20] Landiun: i have 76 shatters
[3:13:21] Halconauta: @Landiun please don't backseat game
[3:13:27] NuketheFreakinWeak: Rune of removal is 100% but 1 at a time. Shattering is 0-7 (depending on affix tier) its a chance
[3:13:30] Fivecen7: nah its really easy to get shatter runes later
[3:13:31] Landiun: it's 2k gold for a vendor one
[3:13:31] Aldavael: you will run out
[3:13:34] funboix0x0: He's asking doe
[3:13:37] aresden3: u might run out but u can buy more and its cheap
[3:13:38] BIDMAL: u'll just shatter exalts with 1-2 usefull affixes (if more - try upgrade or merge for example)
[3:13:39] Aldavael: can never have too many
[3:13:42] LemonTease: Looking
[3:13:48] bluestone2000: Madge what @MinhooMinh
[3:13:50] RisaGayle: FirstTimeBackseating
[3:13:51] TECA_btw: if youre running out then be more selective, if youre stockpiling then be more generous
[3:13:58] Landiun: honestly i just shatter things with high tier affixes i want to use later
[3:14:10] LemonTease: LuvSnooze LuvSnooze vivisp1Beffrl vivisp1Beffrl vivisp1Beffrl LuvSnooze LuvSnooze LuvSnooze vivisp1AHH vivisp1AHH vivisp1AHH vivisp1Bye vivisp1Bye
[3:14:24] KatAlicia: Mod but not a dub? HUH @Landiun
[3:14:25] Landiun: if it's one i forsure want to get full value of a good one i'll remove till it removes it then shatter
[3:14:32] KatAlicia: *sub
[3:14:35] Rangedd: @TECA_btw this sounds right to me

[3:15:17] TECA_btw: theres really no harm in running out of shatters, you can still collect items to shatter later
[3:15:29] Landiun: i personally would
[3:15:33] Landiun: because you don't really run out
[3:15:41] FlyinDachshund: what the hell is giving you all that ward @sneakylol
