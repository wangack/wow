[0:08:13] taylorsdank: @Huntahray sodcore was more of a mini challenge for ravs community so not like thousands and thousands of people doingit
[0:08:17] dcpyg: whats that
[0:08:29] OlBoris: dank mounts
[0:08:29] shrewdwhitedude28: what that means
[0:08:33] Huntahray: @taylorsdank Gotcha! Was there a reason for it being horde or was it pesonal preference??

[0:08:50] catapultingyomama: !/
[0:08:59] shrewdwhitedude28: I’m out of Shards sorry
[0:08:59] SAMELLTV: 123
[0:09:00] taylorsdank: @Huntahray Probably a reason but I'm not positive. maybe cause rav only did alliance in real hardcore
[0:09:06] jagermeisterxox: Horde = Best Race
[0:09:07] SAMELLTV: r
[0:09:13] itsFluxuation: @Huntahray I think Rav wanted to try leveling horde as they just did alliance

[0:11:31] jagermeisterxox: Alliance is full of Woke pussys
[0:11:37] shrewdwhitedude28: Okay I want all your guys opinion it’s controversial though
[0:11:50] itsFluxuation: They get salv which is just ez mode raiding
[0:11:56] shrewdwhitedude28: wouldn’t it be cool if alliance had mage and Horde had warlock

[0:13:22] kaizerlight: @shrewdwhitedude28 on what basis would justify that change? i mean that paladins are alliance and shamans are horde are because of lore. why would horde have warlock and alliance mages?

[0:46:04] chungus_ult: what was best pvp xpac?
[0:46:07] tdhmagic: hard to go soft after you’ve been hard
[0:46:07] Rylexn: I find it so hard to even play SOD after hardcore. just lacks that feeling if you know you know
[0:46:09] Saturos47: @Xaryu how do you feel about gnomer being only a 10man
[0:46:12] Vichrinox: Hardcore was a godsend for Twitch wow streamers
[0:46:13] AlamorthTV: It's definetely true that it's a dopamine rush when playing, but when you die it's a mega dopamine drop
[0:46:13] Thomasdurso: do you delete your dead characters ?
[0:46:15] FeelsBadWoman: same happened to me in path of exile, once a hardcore always a hardcore
[0:46:17] DatDudeTez: i played hardcore final fantasy 11

[0:46:21] vesajj: hey bud, can't decide between maining ele or mage for phase 2 SoD, any recomendation? i feel like both are going to pump....

[0:46:26] chungus_ult: what do you think was best pvp xpac?
[0:46:27] LeighUzumaki: moonguard makes wow a true rpg
[0:46:29] Tymburlol: HC SSF > trade leagues all day baby
[0:46:35] brokedownalice: i love the way hc makes you play, it makes you really learn your character
[0:46:37] Meer_: hardcore peak was like heroine best wow period
[0:46:40] scathez: can you explain ssf ruleset?
[0:46:40] t1isokatleague: cant wait till ssf comes out
[0:46:41] EfeGamii: dont u think too far to horde?
[0:46:43] itsZelion: 10 mans are super chill
[0:46:45] raider2152: in phase 2, will you go SSF sodcore before normal sod?
[0:46:47] timochiiGG: wasnt wow being easier in that aspect the reason it became king of mmo's to begin with tho?
[0:46:50] bambirexkekw: i got Sulz in my HC run, pretty sure that invalidated it kek
[0:46:50] XialdinSR: what ever happened with official SSF? wasnt that supposed to be coming out this month?
[0:46:53] Xaryu: !sodcore
[0:46:53] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[0:46:54] hulimonduli: even BFD is getting hard  to fill this late in the phase if it's not on a reset day or something
[0:46:54] kirk_hunts: I jsut want weekly lockouts
[0:46:55] zen0vae: you could prob solo it at that point anyways
[0:46:56] Knocktoff: the true hardcore is getting fangsly boosted
[0:46:56] kasperprime: and loot would be so hard to get split 25 ways
[0:47:06] kirk_hunts: yeah for scheduling
[0:47:07] hindsightnwk: What is SSF?
[0:47:07] pinchhithero: I have never played WoW. Do you recommend Day 1 SSF HC?
[0:47:12] lejtan1: 5 day would be nice
[0:47:18] leonwaltt: speedrunning streaming
[0:47:19] iwishiwasnotbored: @hindsightnwk solo self found
[0:47:19] Vichrinox: What do you all think about Phase 4 Kharazan Basement?
[0:47:21] DiogoPT96: I never played wow but whatching you playing hardcore actually makes me wanna play lmao
[0:47:23] vesajj: i agree with weekly, too hard to create a consistant schedule
[0:47:24] Dmon_365: DO IT
[0:47:28] PlayerBenefit: i hate the 3 day lockout
[0:47:32] Dmon_365: naw just full send it
[0:47:32] Saiauriel: SoD phases are short so 3 day lockouts make sense
[0:47:35] Baron_Colvin: I feel 3 day is a little short if you are playing multiple characters and are trying to do 4 clears over 3 days
[0:47:38] kirk_hunts: I run a guild I lead 5 BFDs per lockout
[0:47:39] espi: its too much
[0:47:40] noochlol: yes
[0:47:42] xNotorietyx: hell no I love it
[0:47:42] YuraruY: nah i love it

[0:47:48] Knocktoff: yes
[0:47:49] honeybadgerrr2: yeah playing HARD all the time can really get draining

[0:47:50] zen0vae: no way 3 day lockout is amazing
[0:47:50] Thejacob250: Ive geared 5 characters
[0:47:50] xiClutchBoyix: 3 day is sick
[0:47:50] savagesap: i play wow now for a month.. and totally addicted gonna play hardcore ssf for sure and cata to.. but for now hooked on sod
[0:47:51] rlnsneakyhands: i love the 3 day lock out
[0:47:51] DrLegend305: 3 day is great
[0:47:52] PlayerBenefit: i work full time its awful trying to get with the guild
[0:47:53] Utmost777: 3day bothers me because the reset day changes every week
[0:47:53] AlamorthTV: Do you know if Rav actually never played wow before he made his hunter on HC?
[0:47:53] prodigy_wow: 3 days is pog
[0:47:53] lejtan1: 3 day is nice for streamers , for ppl with real lives not so much
[0:47:53] itsFluxuation: @Baron_Colvin It takes 30m wym
[0:47:53] LeighUzumaki: right now its annoying
[0:47:54] ryan___mcg: cuz i need BIS
[0:47:54] Jayceza: i love the 3 day
[0:47:55] karlipet333: no3 day rly good
[0:47:55] EfeGamii: too far i mean we have to to tb and get our buff orgrimmar or undercity zeplin to other continent and fily like 15 or 20 mins to badlands and walking like a 15  mins more
[0:47:55] alexgoat94: 3 days is fine
[0:47:55] BouncingFate: no i think 3 day is way better
[0:47:55] Klopernikus: need 1 day lockout
[0:47:55] Boldie117: I like raiding on a schedule every week. 3 day lockout makes it awkward.
[0:47:56] Saturos47: many people skipped BFD when leveling as a 5 man. who is going to bother to 10 man it when leveling @Xaryu
[0:47:56] TwitchTourist_: They could get rid of it by now, since p1 is already over
[0:47:56] nezt1: i love you
[0:47:56] kirk_hunts: It's too much if you're an organizer
[0:47:57] tdhmagic: If you’ve ever played D&D you would enjoy Hardcore
[0:47:57] DrPepsi_: 3 day lockout is free content, keepåt it
[0:47:58] RockyMountainOyster: for 10 man it works
[0:47:58] Deomas11: 3 day lockout for a 45 min dungeon is really good
[0:47:58] highimlow: 10 man raids are a great idea as well
[0:47:58] BootsTheAlpaca: BootsTheAlpaca subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Ayo 5 month anniversary?
[0:47:59] shloom995: 1 day would be fire
[0:47:59] itsZelion: being against the 3 day lock out is a crazy hot take
[0:47:59] ghouliett: bored of 10 mans
[0:47:59] jacksunson: 5 day pog
[0:48:01] Dmon_365: no the 3 day is great, the raids are super quick so if you have a few toons keeps you busy in game
[0:48:02] vesajj: naw some days people are busy so we have rotating raid
[0:48:02] nizule: more casual, doesn’t matter if a pug gets ruined
[0:48:02] movit1: 4 day would be perfet
[0:48:02] bonkzilla77: good thig is ot a week
[0:48:03] ghouliett: want a 20man
[0:48:04] PMA_1: it can be toxic because world buffs
[0:48:04] Grashh: Why would i want to wait an entire week to do a glorified lvl 40 dungeon
[0:48:04] Indomitablez: @Xaryu 3 day is good for the first few weeks, then it should be changed to 1 day lockout
[0:48:05] kev1ncredible: it would be better if they made it 2 specific days, hard to plan around days always shifting
[0:48:08] shatmurloc: it’s good until you have nothing else you need lol
[0:48:10] karlipet333: its freat
[0:48:14] hulimonduli: youre going to want that 3 day lockout when the cap is higher and you dont have all your alts leveled up
[0:48:15] kirk_hunts: if you organize a guild it is a lot of work
[0:48:15] kev1ncredible: like reset on Tues/Sat
[0:48:16] iRayG2: 3days > 1week
[0:48:16] prodigy_wow: 1 week can be more exciting but gearing quick is nice
[0:48:18] zen0vae: i log on every 3 days at this point
[0:48:19] PlayerBenefit: if you work a full time job its insanely difficult to get to raid with your guild
[0:48:19] karlipet333: 3 day good
[0:48:21] Utmost777: should it go to Daily in p2?
[0:48:27] Baron_Colvin: @itsFluxuation Usually yes, but I've spent more time looking for groups most time than running the dungeon
[0:48:27] DaveM991: Forces you to level alts or do other stuff rather than just spam it over and over with the same character
[0:48:27] tylive52: @xaryu it would be nice if they lifted it last week get everyone bissed out for p2
[0:48:29] Jubilation12: i love 3 day
[0:48:33] xNotorietyx: twice a week, takes 30mins.

[0:49:04] niall_9: of course! you don’t want to lose the pearl 27 times

[1:39:47] crvyxn: @robtest even with lava lash using rb on bot weapons is typically just better
[1:39:49] kenobi_sod: go for a second pants so you can switch fast between shamanistic rage and way of earth
[1:39:50] crvyxn: both*
[1:39:59] PMA_1: water shield is nice too @Xaryu  , you can get it at your level
[1:40:04] kirk_hunts: Would you take a day to do wargames with Bean’s team in SOD he’s one of the best Druid FCs on one of the best teams in the scene right now.

[1:41:46] steasyqt: but you have more dps as tank
[1:41:46] PMA_1: make lava lash and molten blast in the same macro, they are the same rune slot @Xaryu , saves keybind
[1:41:47] ketchgg: you just need to pull more mobs + shield
[1:41:52] shuyinko123: U need dual wield rune from TB
[1:41:54] NeverKrowsBest: go see if the rare is up in the lake outside wc
[1:41:56] Len1366: Does dual wield shaman follow the typical MH/OH weapon speed preferences?
[1:41:59] crvyxn: you should try to get water shield, it's really close, really lets you go ham with shocks
[1:42:08] Snak3InBo0ts: did you get your daily dose of barny? :D
[1:42:17] I34773: i dont think dw is worth it without the hit rune

[1:42:45] TrueNosus: water shield isnt worth unless your healing imo @Xaryu
[1:42:48] OllyWombat: it helps.  annoying to keep the water shield up @Xaryu
[1:42:55] PMA_1: @shuyinko123 it says lvl 20 on it
[1:42:57] magog_1428: Dont forget lvl 1 earth shock with way of earth
[1:43:01] marcelomakulas: thanks

[1:43:11] TheMightis: Could always get Shamanistic Rage Rune. Very good to regen mana and take les dmg
[1:43:16] worthlesswatkins: should have searing totem out

[1:43:19] worthlesswatkins: every time
[1:43:20] larnsmarf: shaman seems nuts
[1:43:24] crvyxn: it's not only for healing
[1:43:24] shuyinko123: @PMA_1 Say that u need to kill mobs with eart- fire - frost1
[1:43:39] wonderbro: lighting shield is most mana efficient spell as well early
[1:43:40] spacetravelergaming: shield is bis
[1:43:43] Qslank: Lava lash is a trash ability and always has been since wotlk lol, water shield with a shield is better dps and spamming shocks spells
[1:43:49] Len1366: yea dual field is obviously handicapped without the DW rune
[1:43:56] bburton02: Get Shamanistic Rage.
[1:43:59] TheMightis: Daggers suck for dpsing/leveling
[1:43:59] ketchgg: pull 2

[1:44:10] mumbley: dual wield for style
[1:44:12] DonSilvers: ye
[1:44:15] PeeDub1969: try 3
[1:44:20] shmekkkk: Shield is safer
[1:44:20] sunmantv: safety first
[1:44:20] kremdes: DW only wokrs when you have the hit rune. warden can aoe
[1:44:25] TacoN64: shield for armor, block
[1:44:27] JEM_GG: DW is ugly, tank or 2h for me
[1:44:28] wonderbro: shield + keep up lightning shield
[1:44:28] Vanpresto: do you have a list of addons or a build we can download? your questie looks different from mine
[1:44:29] BlackRe3per: maybe when you get sham rage you can DW
[1:44:29] Leemster30: might not be worth until later levels. i personally go dual wield

[1:45:11] Trickymaster: the mana back is really nice tho
[1:45:11] mellohh4444: would need a high dmg offhand
[1:45:13] arianfiftyone: @colm35 dual wield is a skill from a quest, the rune just goves you 10% hit
[1:45:18] jameslxmb: hi
[1:45:19] LoosieJuice: @colm35 lava lash unlocks the ability to dual wield. dw rune unlocks the extra 10% damage. different things.

[1:46:02] jazzyjoff: Why dont you use Strength of Earth Totem?
[1:46:08] ninjuhh_d4: @xaryu  ya but the reason you have as much dps with shield is cause your shocking and using totems but when dial wielding I don't think you were
[1:46:10] plsnojebait: how are you gonna milk another 3 weeks out of sod phase 1
[1:46:13] noxthentus: How hard is it to level a mage in SoD ?

[2:03:38] iRayG2: HC has the best community imo

[2:55:59] playerpersonx: if you want a really good not too expensive chair: Arozzi Vernazza. I paid $250 on sale and I can sit in it for literally 12 hours and not feel fatigued at all
[2:56:02] vist0o: if u cant afford it get $200 ergonomic chair from amazon, still better than gaming chairs
[2:56:07] shtubbs: I have lower back pain, and I will never sit in anything other than the Herman Miller mesh again.  Completely worth the price if you can afford it

[2:58:20] Fourleaf_TV: For gamers especially PC things are about asthetics more then functionality. (if you are not specificaly talk about hardware)
[2:58:22] RickPhilip: Do you prefer Mesh on both the sitting area + back or just the back?

[3:37:50] morat_g: Druids are hungry for perma use crowd pummler, we've grinded out thousands

[3:38:51] ricktickticcow: people will just make alts. it wouldn't change anything
[3:38:51] kindaopmusic: theres a "take a break" add on
[3:38:53] Ricochet_EU: Rested XP is actually that system. Blizzard thought of putting in punishment for playing too long, but then decided to reward NOT playing.
[3:38:55] FZanix: Correct me if I'm wrong, but at 25, rain of fire is the only AOE locks have, right?
[3:38:56] YungGuacadile: foh thats such a bad idea

[3:39:22] Josephxdxp: drink monster and eat cereal and binge level wow for 40 hours
[3:39:22] Mahca_: maybe people just need  some self control

[3:39:52] grizz430: thats probably for bots instead of health
[3:39:57] YouGotMooed: How do you get the profession trainers to show on the map?
[3:39:57] jubileujubileus: @Xaryu what's your deadlift PR?
[3:40:00] NutterCircus: I can imagine in a communist country, they would limit your personal time.
[3:40:00] limburgse: @Josephxdxp sounds like a regular weekend :P
[3:40:11] Meolas22: OSRS is the MMO equivalent of Civ - just one more XP drop
[3:40:17] Jayceza: farming rock crabs?
[3:40:20] MR_WYTE: Somehow I never got into RuneScape and went straight to EverQuest.
[3:40:22] Rustorn: It's more to prevent bots
[3:40:23] Gashunk1: did you hear about the ring of torment
[3:40:23] FoxAroundFindOut: I had a Paper boy job just to get membership for Runescape and WoW BC
[3:40:24] cringebreezy: no better feelings than getting your first rune scim/d scim or something
[3:40:26] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: Classic was the best
[3:40:26] morat_g: You should do osrs Ironman sometime, I'm sure it'd get old but it would be fun for a few days

[3:41:10] metastasized: there is also group hardcore Ironman so you can play with the boys
[3:41:10] FoxAroundFindOut: Team OSRS Ironman. You should see if you can colab  with Flutten
[3:41:12] alienistslol: OSRS is so incredibly boring to watch, there's a reason why that game isn't popular on twitch
[3:41:13] VanVelzz: Do no hit Zelda runs, those are intense hahaha

[3:41:36] smit0r: Elden Ring Randomizer is crazy fun
[3:41:37] booderduder: Diablo 2 where hardcore was born
[3:41:40] SghettiBoy: @tchadvader lol yea good luck
[3:41:44] SjenkieReborn: hardcore is a bad gamemode on runescape, servers are bad and most players are not skilled enough and limit themselves to 80% of content
[3:41:45] snugglefistsgaming: They already do that and some do it without ever getting hit
[3:41:46] jimmy_irl: yall tweaking you cannot do ER hardcore unless you've been playng souls for years

[4:08:20] DatGuyAnton: Asmongold is retried, now we have Zackrawr or whatever
[4:08:27] boonegam: hes full of knowledge
[4:08:32] Gashunk1: I like asmon
[4:08:37] joedestiny: have you tried the hunter dps class yet? @Xaryu
[4:08:38] wpprrz: @drei0804 didnt ask
[4:08:52] SpaceCowboy0811: Guzu said earlier that Asmon has "Acended" as a streamer lol
[4:08:55] GoliathIRL: i agree with that statement. his community is toxic asf
[4:09:00] taylorsdank: he probably got his chat pulled up by asmon
[4:09:03] Jjinks: asmon isnt his fans can be a bit toxic though, hes really good at moderating is chat though
[4:09:04] GoliathIRL: used to love the guy
[4:09:04] sumdumphuk: I found you from suggested videos on YouTube. You're a better streamer, less toxic for sure
[4:09:05] pkmnrepub: have you tried the wind serpent class?
[4:09:06] Fourleaf_TV: "asmon is a dick" translates to "Asmond doesnt agree with me on things"
[4:09:07] Ebsoulo: Asmon is the goat
[4:09:08] denkadahlgren: I love asmon
[4:09:09] TransMutedMaya: i don't like asmon's toxic content tbh
[4:09:15] Gashunk1: but iI like payo and staysafe equal. I feel like a child with seperated parents
[4:09:16] BootsTheAlpaca: Asmon is awesome. He's real af
[4:09:22] californiacal: any community is gonna be toxic when it gets that big
[4:09:22] blazzedzz: I love asmon I started watching twitch because his YouTube vids
[4:09:26] Qezwick: asmon is liberal toxic not edgy toxic
[4:09:27] NovaGX4: I mean Soda kinda made hc popular again
[4:09:27] zen0vae: nah asmon is real
[4:09:28] Yogsoggeth: Asmon is a smart guy. That doesn't bode well in a world for of morons :D
[4:09:28] Jayceza: hes just a realist , it comes off as duchey.
[4:09:29] Lillpirren: Asmon is goated
[4:09:29] burkey1133: Finally caught a stream. My 6 month son enjoys watching your videos with me daily
[4:09:30] garbage003: @Fourleaf_TV that's a great point lol  when ppl complain they don't like his opinoin lol'
[4:09:32] Bowrogan: lol
[4:09:32] jimmysnowshoes: The bigger the community, the more toxic people there will be
[4:09:36] canonic: he's highly intelligent
[4:09:37] asloff: Good afternoon Xar :)
[4:09:38] handstand_man: asmon will flush out conflict and think it through fully, more than what most people do
[4:09:38] DatGuyAnton: xQc KEKW
[4:09:40] Mahca_: he can have a bit of an echo chamber but so do a lot of big streamers
[4:09:44] OrganikCum: i dont think asmon would disagree tbh, he kind of embraces being a dick
[4:09:45] Bowrogan: Asmon spends too much time arguing with people in his chat
[4:09:48] SillyPanda: @canonic KEKW
[4:09:48] TheLaxedd: i like asmon he’s pretty smart. i don’t always agree but he’s logical
[4:09:49] Jayceza: mob mentality
[4:09:50] adam_brisbane: like Swifties?
[4:09:50] soloBubatz: @NovaGX4 and gold buying
[4:09:53] Gashunk1: "Imagine beeing online just to hate"
[4:09:54] mirandas: 10k is sweet spot
[4:09:56] Maehdras18: 10k+ viewers = mob mentality for sure
[4:09:58] Alerothan: I dont think he's a dick as much as I just dont like how he's focused so much on negative things these days. Its always him reacting and talking about all the worst things
[4:09:59] drei0804: Asmond spews hate on wow. Wow made him who he is now
[4:10:02] CyprixPlayz: can i farm the mobs?
[4:10:03] Chaoszero_goc: Playing shaman Kreygasm I love pvp on my shaman purge earth shock purge
[4:10:04] kkzam: oh they died in the wetlands D:
[4:10:05] fan_oh: how is it an echo chamber if he's arguing with them half the time lol
[4:10:05] TransMutedMaya: yeah but asmon himself does weird anti woke content, which is designed to engage toxic people lol
[4:10:07] electriqboogie: Whole village
[4:10:09] einself111: i don't think his community is toxic at all ... ofc there are always some idiots when you have 30k viewers
[4:10:12] SillyPanda: @drei0804 "asmond" KEKW
[4:10:13] zen0vae: it represents humanity
[4:10:13] Pixiepantss: yeah its rough
[4:10:15] hutchyy917: certain people are drawn to certain people
[4:10:17] partakone66: asmong old for president
[4:10:18] chaquilleoneill: I think it’s like that with Charlie’s community too, some bad actors always find a way to
[4:10:30] playerpersonx: @drei0804 70 IQ logic
[4:10:40] Chrigss: @TransMutedMaya any average person is anti woke to an extent
[4:10:41] howtowinyt: we dont need all the hate in chat, go stew your anger in your own chamber
[4:10:43] handstand_man: LMFAO listening to these parasocial nerds crying about asmongold LUL
[4:10:46] partakone66: asmong old for presidentr
[4:10:48] lampsterof79: My first impression that lasted a few years I thought he was a cokmplete dick.  Then I listened to longer twitch streams lately and he seems pretty intellegent.
[4:10:52] lampsterof79: Noyt like my typing
[4:10:56] denkadahlgren: o7
[4:11:00] Jayceza: its crazy to me that he literally removed his sub button
[4:11:06] Gashunk1: streamers need to update their memes before I get banned again tho
[4:11:08] FeelsBadWoman: hundred k is like 2 stadiums of people
[4:11:13] TransMutedMaya: @weeatrockss I'm aware that being toxic is pretty common
[4:11:13] TheLaxedd: Drei is smooth brained
[4:11:15] asloff: @weeatrockss what is "anti woke"?
[4:11:16] suicidle: asmon is extremely smart as well; most of his takes are based in common sense and hard to argue against.
[4:11:18] TheRealPabloSanchez: I remember you hit a eprsonal record (probably broke it again) doing Torghast. Was wild.
[4:11:22] Alerothan: Been watching Asmon since WoD and I've always loved his content but he is a little full of himself. But I'm pretty sure he admits that himself lol
[4:11:29] hollawalah: imagine liking asmon
[4:11:31] based_chad1: @drei0804 no he does not, he actually tries to provide constructive criticism.  He regularly says classic wow is the best mmo of all time
[4:11:31] spacetravelergaming: sham tank da best
[4:11:37] MrZestie: @drei0804 he dislikes the game that hes played almost his whole life because its gone in a direction that he doesnt like, who cares lol
[4:11:48] Gashunk1: many are very defensive, worst trait
[4:11:57] drei0804: @playerpersonx sorry if your a fan, i use to watch him, but i just dont like the toxicity he causes for wow.
[4:12:06] Zahnstocherzimtstern: talking in asmon chat ins 98% of the time, tiping into the void
[4:12:14] hutchyy917: bc you are able to engage and talk w us
[4:12:15] mirandas: shadow lands]
[4:12:15] playerpersonx: because PvP is niche content
[4:12:16] Takilleur: try talking with a huge accent too fast and saying dumb shit
[4:12:16] hutchyy917: SL
[4:12:16] Alerothan: Shadowlands
[4:12:17] prfssrzaddy: SL
[4:12:17] asloff: shadowlands
[4:12:18] BullzeyeWoW: Shadowlands
[4:12:19] finalflight1: Shadowlands
[4:12:20] DatGuyAnton: @Xaryu In wow must be due to HC aspect in some part
[4:12:21] nequor: SL
[4:12:24] Huntahray: BfA best expansion
[4:12:28] kodtheog: cata
[4:12:30] howtowinyt: well its because the hype is at its highest when its fresh, and if its fresh you'll be leveling most the time :P
[4:12:31] Mahca_: pve is easier for casuals to follow than PvP arena
[4:12:36] einself111: pve is easy to follow and you are a great entertainer if you don't have to hyper focus
[4:12:36] NobudeLand: competitive play is for a select few, pve is for e1
[4:12:39] californiacal: xar is a pve andy wow
[4:12:40] wpprrz: Shadowlands..
[4:12:43] wpprrz: KEKW
[4:12:43] Alerothan: PvP is played by such a small % of wows playerbase
[4:12:45] Jukeing: i started watching you in New World, stayed for the WoW
[4:12:47] hntb100: peoplelike casual content
[4:12:51] playerpersonx: @drei0804 I'm not a fan, I'm just saying the logic you're using makes no sense. He can't criticize WoW because he made a career out of it?
[4:12:52] Fraynchize: pve is easier to watch when working its more just haning out t
[4:12:53] kodtheog: oh i started watching you because of pvp
[4:12:54] pinkmegan: all your pve streams are for some hype new thing
[4:12:56] Fraynchize: pvp you have to pay attention
[4:12:58] shaime5: there is no 2v2 here ?
[4:12:58] DatGuyAnton: !followage
[4:12:59] StreamElements: @DatGuyAnton, datguyanton has been following xaryu for  7 months 19 days 22 hours
[4:13:00] Yakemae: @Alerothan yea ppl wanna chill
[4:13:01] BujuArena: the reason is because it's exciting seeing a pro pvper playing pve
[4:13:01] howtowinyt: i love new world era
[4:13:02] SillyPanda: PvP is just so hard to spectate for most people. Huge barrier to entry vs "boss hp go down"
[4:13:03] suicidle: same.
[4:13:04] MrZestie: @playerpersonx i feel like PvP is niche content because devs made it that way... the whole concept of this game was pretty much pvp because of the factions
[4:13:08] Chrigss: @asloff conservative mindset
[4:13:10] r4men_noodle: That Mak Gora tourney owned too though
[4:13:11] suicidle: i wish BDO would blow up again
[4:13:14] thisisbrettt: YOUR THE ONLY ONE
[4:13:15] miciahclay: Wish that game had better longevity
[4:13:15] Jayceza: what about everquest?
[4:13:15] zebercetanayurt: i check steamcharts for new world every 3 months
[4:13:15] Maehdras18: Pve = casual = more focus on the conversations
[4:13:16] Gashunk1: it will
[4:13:16] thisisbrettt: THE ONLY
[4:13:18] jst0neball: I started watching right before xarbarian. found you on YouTube
[4:13:18] Jukeing: Missed opportunity w/ that game
[4:13:19] ceejayx42: same, i enjoyed this
[4:13:19] TheKraken2024: I hated that game
[4:13:19] SpaceCowboy0811: I started watching you so i could learn how to beat FMP
[4:13:20] Schwabernaut: it had so muchy potential
[4:13:20] kodtheog: nah beta for new world was amazing but original relase was awful
[4:13:20] Takilleur: you should take a good look at throne and liberty
[4:13:21] playerpersonx: @drei0804 that's like saying you can't criticize your father because he made you. completely crazy logic
[4:13:22] einself111: no i enjoyed the first couple of months
[4:13:22] TimtheMage09: i still play it
[4:13:22] Huntahray: I played new world before mounts were in
[4:13:22] miciahclay: Really enjoyed it at launch
[4:13:23] FZanix: New World was my first real MMO.
[4:13:23] illyiochess: Shadowlands wasnt just hell lore wise but gameplay as well
[4:13:23] MrZestie: i loved new world when it released
[4:13:23] sargent_baddy: Played it and it got boring so quickly
[4:13:24] serverfirst300003: @Xaryu ud love Throne and Liberty its what NW should have been, i missed NW and TL just scratches that itch
[4:13:24] burkey1133: i wanted new world to pop off so hard. but it just burnt out quick
[4:13:24] dobbygang19: I love the combat of new world
[4:13:25] whamtv: it’s because you can be more engaged with your community when doing PVE stuff
[4:13:25] LOBSTERGOPEENCHPEENCH: new world slapped when it came out
[4:13:25] WintersWolfcry: New World is amazing - I really want it to find its stride as wel
[4:13:26] Huntahray: Solid crafting system
[4:13:26] TMMOOF: About as much as I think about the Roman Empire
[4:13:27] TheRealPabloSanchez: I followed in 2018 to learn some sweaty PvP skills
[4:13:27] miciahclay: good core to the game fs
[4:13:28] jpdx3: No
[4:13:29] Shuboonda: launch month of New World was incredible
[4:13:30] MrZestie: new world is my roman empire
[4:13:32] Bahood: i never caught the wave
[4:13:35] morat_g: New world with lots of end game content wouldnhave been the wow killer
[4:13:35] blazzedzz: I also love new world
[4:13:36] Mahca_: I just want something to compete with wow
[4:13:37] nequor: short but fun as hell
[4:13:37] BujuArena: i constantly think about Rift.  Rift is crazy-good and not sure how it didn't take off like wow
[4:13:41] howtowinyt: i put 500 hours first month or something crazy like that love the game
[4:13:42] Gashunk1: We already created the big bang
[4:13:42] canonic: you're joking, pvp is a bunch of picking on people weaker than you and arenas is running and hiding
[4:13:45] Jukeing: I sometimes logon, see its dead and get off after afking in town for 30 mintes
[4:13:46] xiClutchBoyix: No it's definitely not just you.  There at least six other people that love it too LULW
[4:13:47] kodtheog: the beta slapped
[4:13:47] Gashunk1: let's just forge it
[4:13:47] YumuSae: Naah Xaryu our clan won 50 wars in a row i was top DMg all of them, it was literally the most fun ive had in a game since i think TBC wow back in the day. Pog
[4:13:48] smit0r: Yes, friend of mine works on New World QA, most of his team is getting ready to work on the new MMO (Lord of the Rings) looks like Amazon doesn't even think about it...
[4:13:50] shukanara: new world has gotten much better since launch: added mounts, expansions, world bosses etc
[4:13:51] californiacal: i think about MoP once a week
[4:13:54] Apexx9011: @xaryu u have more views rn than Amouranth… but imagine the simps that watch her rn LUL
[4:13:55] miciahclay: Now they are just testing stuff for their LoR MMO instead haha
[4:14:02] kodtheog: riot mmo will compete
[4:14:03] suicidle: BDO <3
[4:14:04] Jayceza: nothing as good
[4:14:08] gd_azduel: that wow factor
[4:14:09] Afecter: so true
[4:14:09] Alerothan: @canonic What kind of mindeset is this lmao. Its called competition
[4:14:10] SghettiBoy: WoW just has that perfect blend
[4:14:10] BujuArena: rift has that same smoothness and replayability
[4:14:10] Yakemae: @suicidle ROFL
[4:14:11] zebercetanayurt: wut they will make a LOTR MMO??
[4:14:11] TimtheMage09: I cannot wait for the riot MMO just so WoW can have a competetor
[4:14:12] HexedPk: naw there is nothing out there good elsewhere
[4:14:12] Afecter: no mmo is as smooth as wow
[4:14:13] SghettiBoy: I cant explain
[4:14:13] skapitanov: @Xaryu  Are you doing WC soon?
[4:14:14] almighty_h0lm: nothing has been competing with wow since before 2005
[4:14:15] Mtundu: I think about the roman empire weekly
[4:14:15] howtowinyt: Rift came out in an era where nothing new was needed, now we have an mmo shortage of sorts
[4:14:17] crusteff1: and the colors are addictive
[4:14:19] larnsmarf: new world just needs a way tomake its own pvp content
[4:14:20] TheRealPabloSanchez: @kodtheog in 2050
[4:14:21] larnsmarf: like wow
[4:14:24] limburgse: not perfect but we love it!
[4:14:26] MrZestie: @Xaryu did you ever get into mutations in New World?
[4:14:26] suicidle: @Yakemae ROFL i have 12k hrs
[4:14:26] Mahca_: wow has nostalgia and lore to care about. new mmos don’t have that connection
[4:14:28] kodtheog: @TheRealPabloSanchez yeah but it wil lbe good
[4:14:32] Curtsy: Games being made just to compete with wow has lead to 100+ failed mmorpgs over the past 20 years, games need to be made because people want them to not just to be a big dog
[4:14:36] almighty_h0lm: anyone played Rift?
[4:14:38] TheKraken2024: I enjoyed GW2 for the most part.  Almost a great game
[4:14:40] playerpersonx: I mention this all the time. There's literally no MMO out there that feels as smooth to play as WoW. Like, in the actual character movement. Iirc the devs spent a LOT of time perfecting it as well
[4:14:42] TheRealPabloSanchez: @kodtheog haha I hope so.
[4:14:45] shukanara: new world has been getting better with pvp by having arenas and such but its still not great
[4:14:47] lampsterof79: Patience.....
[4:14:49] SghettiBoy: Retail just feels so bloated and confusing for me
[4:14:53] baril47: RuneScape is the mmo I have spent most of my time in
[4:14:56] smit0r: Best part about New World unironically is the sound design... Wood chopping and trees... OMG so good.
[4:14:57] baleyha1: fav hc experience? @Xaryu
[4:15:04] wpprrz: Yeah smacking 3 mobs at the same time is nice
[4:15:04] SghettiBoy: also i kinda have a problem with transmog and I know that is controversial for some folk
[4:15:04] howtowinyt: i have 0 problems with new worlds pvp whats not to like?
[4:15:05] TimtheMage09: I cannot wait for the riot MMO just so WoW can have a competetor
[4:15:09] kodtheog: too little too late
[4:15:13] BujuArena: @almighty_h0lm yeah, Rift is amazing; should have been a wow killer
[4:15:14] Gashunk1: but if the game is shit it is shit,  that stephen guy looks like a guy that is willing
[4:15:15] kodtheog: they also stop focusing on pvp
[4:15:16] morat_g: It needs more endgame content
[4:15:19] Jayceza: rift was fun on release and the hype was live. died fast tho 😕
[4:15:21] InfamousGandhi: i wouldnt want to relevel new world though
[4:15:21] Mahca_: it already made a bad first impression tho
[4:15:23] digaboom: I honestly like Retail no one hurt me
[4:15:24] naturalduck: Are you any interested in Monster Hunter World
[4:15:25] SghettiBoy: I want Rockstar to make a fantasy MMO
[4:15:26] brexy808: You should check Greenfields tweet
[4:15:27] einself111: hype is dead and can't return ... sadly
[4:15:36] HexedPk: my first nw war was one of the best experiences ever
[4:15:38] blazzedzz: NW is fun for a month or so
[4:15:43] baleyha1: fav hc expierence? @Xaryu
[4:15:44] howtowinyt: well the world pvp died cause the game was dying since there was no good end game content
[4:15:46] Mahca_: end game I mean
[4:15:49] zebercetanayurt: duping though
[4:15:50] shukanara: I feel like in the world building for New World, they kinda screwed themselves by making it be on a small island so its hard to expand on
[4:15:55] zen0vae: desync killed new world
[4:15:56] kodtheog: no they had a bad first impression to start with the launch and not having enough servers for the 1 mil people to play
[4:15:57] miciahclay: new world before you get to end game and have time to see the bugs is great :P
[4:16:06] loldesole: After playing Lineage 2 its hard to find another good sieges or smth
[4:16:09] MrZestie: new worlds leveling process was the good impression, the "having no endgame content that worked" was what made the bad impression
[4:16:09] reggiepowa: Classic had more
[4:16:13] cringebreezy: new world gave me that childhood feeling of playing runescape, never had that with any other game
[4:16:13] blazzedzz: NW beta was so fun
[4:16:14] smit0r: They just need to take what they have learned and apply it to the LOTR MMO
[4:16:19] miciahclay: new players getting into still mostly enjoy it, for a while..
[4:16:20] Jukeing: the multiple gold duping exploits is what actually killed the game
[4:16:21] YzieGG: since wildstar I think
[4:16:21] Mahca_: it had a hype launch but didn’t quite deliver
[4:16:22] baleyha1: fav hc experience? @Xaryu
[4:16:23] KonQel: new world before u get to end game and realise it doesnt have anything to do
[4:16:32] SghettiBoy: YYEEEAAA
[4:16:33] morat_g: Yes
[4:16:33] Alerothan: @MrZestie Same exact thing happened to Diablo 4

[4:16:52] Jayceza: nice undies
[4:16:54] miciahclay: The territory control system is bad for the game too. Its just 2-3 guilds per server (at most) that just own everything and have all the gold
[4:16:54] fellifell: the zesty ahh loincloth
[4:16:56] playerpersonx: What's not to like

[4:42:51] ZORIZE: I google about SoD and don't find any simple answers. Everything is so overcomplicated and over informationed
[4:43:01] TimtheMage09: @TheMightis i dont understand the "too many wows" from a normal players perspective, the more content the btter, no?

[4:44:00] ZORIZE: Soulless
[4:44:13] Pokket_Gaming: For someone who plays multiple characters in retail, and then I also enjoy HC and SoD. It's hard to keep up.
[4:44:16] ZORIZE: Blizzard has no soul anymore. Or it has but it's occupied by Satan
[4:44:17] oilerr: yeah but why put 1k ppl on something they dont like, instead let ppl play what they like imo @Xaryu
[4:44:25] BootsTheAlpaca: @socalevo626 Hardcore SSF (Solo Self Found). This means that there is no trading, no grouping, no auction house, no mail, etc. It's scripted into the game this time. Completely solo hardcore, so you have to make everything you have, loot it, buy it from vendors, etc.
[4:44:26] nequor: hardcore servers are now kinda empty
[4:44:27] darkangel57x: why do you care if the server feels dead if you are playing SSF

[4:44:37] appiekap: only 24 hrs in a day
[4:44:39] TimtheMage09: understandable
[4:44:40] ZORIZE: @morat_g x'D
[4:44:43] kodtheog: wotlk is poppin
[4:44:50] cbyrnes09: Will anyone ever get Atiesh on hard-core? That item seems too rare.

[4:46:02] gambleragain: @bolk_1992 same man, i play all 3 and its fun, this SOD HC is really a content squeeze from streamers
[4:46:11] vathx: "Stealing from Peter to pay Paul."
[4:46:16] Takilleur: they should just have classic and release other expansion raids into classic mode
[4:46:23] Weedweed: i cant wait for Cataclysm Classic
[4:46:23] GunBrau: I haven’t played retail WoW since Legion, I played only when classic game back then quit again, and now I play SoD. Not every player is cannibalized, I’m just here for SoD
[4:46:25] morat_g: Bringing players back from twow or nostalrius
[4:46:37] kodtheog: i hate that cata and sod phase 3 are close together thats horrible planning
[4:46:40] Deomas11: HC/SoD etc. drums up a lot of online hype, which can overall attract more players vs cannabalize. Also keeps current players from leaving.
[4:46:45] awsmwsmd: They are adding value. They don't care if you are playing any specific version. They get their money
[4:46:47] Hasbulladin: At the end of the day the money end up going to blizz - doesnt matter which mode you play
[4:46:48] Jayceza: exactly
[4:46:50] jilech: its all about getting people to pay that subscription
[4:46:52] Gashunk1: I'm a private server andy love SoD, quit when Cata launched. Only played moba 1 and will return because i trust in Chris Metzen. Am I retarded?
[4:46:55] Kosmicpanther: also gets people on private servers to pay for wow
[4:46:55] ZORIZE: What fun class to play in SoD?
[4:47:00] h0t_sauce7: Well WoW players are all about doing things fast and first and then complaining theres nothing to do
[4:47:01] DestroyerDa007: sorry to ask such a stupid question, is SoD the seasonal option in the realm selector?
[4:47:02] NekoTheSpook010: Water shield super close btw
[4:47:03] ripintides: or they could just fix retail to make it feel more like the actual game
[4:47:05] amruta_ray: I think SoD is the only update that had tempted me to start up again
[4:47:06] retnuh_92: i think they should take whats good from each version and recreate wow.
[4:47:07] jazzyjoff: You split the player base but you overcome ppl from stopping because they have gone threw the content. I think from a business perspective these things are keeping ppl from leaving in the first place.
[4:47:09] NekoTheSpook010: Might grab that
[4:47:12] kodtheog: @Gashunk1 nah retail has some real potential again with chris metzen tbh
[4:47:17] jazzyjoff: And also cata was a big dip back in the day
[4:47:19] jme143kt: I think people love fresh servers
[4:47:20] Jayceza: instead of having players drop due to stale content , just go play the version you like
[4:47:22] Gashunk1: I feel that way too, but wtf
[4:47:23] twistedbinkz: true i can say that i’m strictly here for sod
[4:47:33] morat_g: Metzen is gonna save retail for sure
[4:47:36] pliley: you already have it
[4:47:36] ripintides: you can get the totem at any level
[4:47:38] Vertov64: you can still grab it now
[4:47:39] espi: you have the totem for watershield
[4:47:39] gambleragain: @Xaryu People need to understand that all expansions of WoW have different appeals, and they're not the same game despite being called WoW.
[4:47:40] AnviThirteen: Thought you already have the totem for it
[4:47:42] ctrlbeesy: xarpog
[4:47:44] Vertov64: but you cant use until level 20
[4:47:48] twistedbinkz: retail lost me after dragon flight
[4:47:54] larnsmarf: i like playin the im really poor game
[4:47:55] StandardOut: RECREATE IN UNREAL ENGINE 5.
[4:47:56] ZORIZE: Chris Mezten returning to Blizzard?
[4:47:56] n0ppiz: EXACLY <3
[4:47:58] larnsmarf: in wow
[4:48:02] Yogsoggeth: WoW 2 bring it
[4:48:03] fozzy8775: definitely !!
[4:48:04] morat_g: Wow 2 coming after the 3 part expansions finish  I think
[4:48:06] kodtheog: one version of wow with all raids being relevant someway would be insane like rotate the weekly raids or something
[4:48:06] almighty_h0lm: cant happen
[4:48:08] strikinqyeet: u cant do that when all the nostalgia cry babies exist
[4:48:09] Gashunk1: that sounds like a dream
[4:48:09] Philopinos: never gona be wow again with youtube and streamers :/
[4:48:09] nim327: Press the reset and start all over!
[4:48:11] clee0724: be one big wow andy <3 LUL
[4:48:12] pliley: you already have that rune
[4:48:13] demonzhunter: no going back
[4:48:18] almighty_h0lm: 60% at least play for nostalgia
[4:48:19] juuno106: thye should just do war within and get rid of ther rest
[4:48:19] Suvantar: But the experience of WoW isn't really thousands of people.  WoW is like the 50-100 people that you actually connected with.  Once you meet those 50 people, the other 950 people on the server might as well not exist.
[4:48:21] Meer_: would have to be WoW 2 to do that
[4:48:21] LOBSTERGOPEENCHPEENCH: impossible
[4:48:21] playerpersonx: @jme143kt people who love classic love fresh yeah. because they love character progression which vanilla WoW does almost perfectly. I feel like the character progression aspect of WoW is overlooked so much. It's insanely addictive
[4:48:22] TodBobertson: THATS WHAT SOD IS GOING TO BE! BEST OF ALL WORLDS!
[4:48:23] Jayceza: nope. people wont like it people will and split or drop
[4:48:28] northern__soul: it would be awesome
[4:48:28] klacklack: How about to twist story and connect SOD & Retail for example via timeline bending etc
[4:48:31] esotaric: retail is dogshit kill that shit already
[4:48:31] Nicholas909: o7
[4:48:32] shankspirate1: its time for wow 2
[4:48:32] larnsmarf: palworld takin all the players
[4:48:32] chrislu18: WoW 2 go back to a single game
[4:48:36] hersheyjh: Everyone has their preferences
[4:48:38] Sourslays: for that to happen they need to do redo
[4:48:38] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[4:48:40] widicuwous: @Philopinos unfortunately true
[4:48:41] blazzedzz: I wonder what will happen after the world soul saga
[4:48:42] handstand_man: if blizzard wants everyone under one roof they would make a new MMO
[4:48:44] Fightmander: is there a hc sod server?
[4:48:45] Reaperz_kinetic: for that to happen they’d need to de-modernize retail after the large three part expansion
[4:48:46] Deomas11: Self found non HC would be dope. No botters.
[4:48:47] 300Stone: have you heard of kizma
[4:48:47] yaro_p: What is the ultimate wow version you opinion?
[4:48:50] Jayceza: tru
[4:48:55] playerpersonx: @Suvantar that sounds like an anecdote
[4:48:58] Ddorn34: What if there was a way to have it be one server but the content you had access depended on which version of the client installed
[4:49:00] BoonesHQ: Like you were saying with the Asmon chat... cant control when it becomes to much
[4:49:08] hutchyy917: dude changes tune
[4:49:09] yaro_p: What wow should be like in 2023 ?
[4:49:09] demonzhunter: yeah totally different time to 2004
[4:49:09] Philopinos: not blaming ! just sayin mistery is not in the games <3
[4:49:11] ZORIZE: EVERYTHING HAS TURNED INTO SHIT AAAAAAAAH
[4:49:12] Gashunk1: why tho but yeah I want MY WOW. but how is that possible
[4:49:14] demonzhunter: completely different
[4:49:14] elydas899: yeah its all Xar's fault!
[4:49:16] Mahca_: blizzard is doing it right from a business standpoint, even the spacing of new content
[4:49:16] gambleragain: Won't happen. Cause classic players tend to be worse at the game, and they hate they can't do the same content the top players are doing. @Xaryu
[4:49:19] morat_g: Guy watching a streamer "those damn streamers"
[4:49:19] Reaperz_kinetic: nah I disagree with that 100% it’s not a streamers fault at all
[4:49:21] fozzy8775: totally different
[4:49:26] bburton02: It’s all Xar’s fault.
[4:49:27] YzieGG: LUL
[4:49:32] zerozuckerl: new internet Pog
[4:49:34] gahdamntoastr: The flip side is you can play the game and choose NOT to watch youtube videos or a twitch streamer
[4:49:35] wpprrz: Xars fault
[4:49:36] Shuboonda: nah it's the streamers, get em outta here
[4:49:37] PeeDub1969: those gd streamers
[4:49:37] Mahca_: players are the problem
[4:49:37] jstuwie: its Xaryus fault!
[4:49:37] gahdamntoastr: and experience it yourself
[4:49:38] retnuh_92: dont hate the player hate the game
[4:49:38] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[4:49:38] ticktockagain: Not Everyone wants the same Flavor... Its like Ice Cream... and if they fail to have a flavor someone else will get those customers. Thats what Bliz wants to avoid
[4:49:40] MarkyOchoa: Can we just blame it all on Asmon?
[4:49:40] jstuwie: lol
[4:49:40] espi: its Xaryu's fault
[4:49:41] shabomination: How do streamers make things worse??? Seems like it would be the opposite
[4:49:43] twitch4home007: depends on the streamer
[4:49:49] H_9_K: we can never go back to what wow was like in 2004
[4:49:49] boonegam: streamers just have a stronger pull on how the servers are played.
[4:49:50] morat_g: Xar why did you kill wow?
[4:49:50] MysterialMan: lowkey without streamers i wouldnt know any wow, like i aint gonna pay and or play this game, sicne its not my type, i am jsut happy watching streamers
[4:49:51] toettiz: So did Xaryu ruin WoW for the rest of us? THANKS ALOT
[4:49:52] jtemp23: its the consumer lol, streamers would only be at fault because people give them any power to be at fault
[4:49:53] draega1989: its Miz fault
[4:49:54] Ethrealss: PULL UP HIS CHAT LOG ASMON STYLE
[4:49:55] bburton02: Nerf Xar
[4:49:55] niall_9: wow is a “Ship of Theseus” problem. They changed it bit by bit over 20 years and now classic and retail have virtually nothing in common
[4:49:55] kodtheog: i also agree that having all these people make every game feel slightly active instead of combining all of the playerbase is a little frustrating from someone who plays multiple versions you gotta keep swapping constantly
[4:49:56] zerozuckerl: xar broke WoW with too many r1 pvp titles
[4:49:59] fozzy8775: all xaryu’s fault !!
[4:50:00] sephiroth1985_: there too much cheats and hacking thease days
[4:50:02] locutus1701: streamers help keep the game alive imo.
[4:50:09] MrStLouis68: its definitely mitch's fault at least "yo"
[4:50:11] spiked0996: dont hate the playER hate the game
[4:50:11] gambleragain: 4 different versions for anyone to enjoy whatever they like.
[4:50:12] elydas899: gonna start saying 'thanks xaryu' anytime something bad happens to me in wow now
[4:50:13] CptBananaBits: It's not all Xaryu's fault it's also Mitch's fault
[4:50:17] boonegam: yo
[4:50:28] Weedweed: Jeff Bezos dumped his wife and picked up some 50 year old banger with fake boobs
[4:50:33] rephlex08: walmart did it first
[4:50:38] hutchyy917: noooooo
[4:50:38] tbseason: which is very true
[4:50:41] Suvantar: I appreciate the fact that Onlyfangs went in with half the guild having never raided before, but getting leveled by your fans and having them give the streamers thousands of gold doesn't really reflect the actual hardcore WoW experience.  I don't think Streamers 'ruin' anything, but what they did isn't really what the normal player does.
[4:50:41] morat_g: Blame the game, not the player
[4:50:42] shadosavage: it's like:  should we ban the internet to keep libraries open?
[4:50:46] demonzhunter: yeah for sure
[4:50:46] fozzy8775: you’ve always gotta be that step ahead!
[4:50:49] Nicholas909: true
[4:50:52] boveylol: god he's so based
[4:50:53] Mahca_: it’s true, and people are choosing to support them vs smaller companies
[4:50:55] elydas899: dont a lot of small businesses use amazon as a platform to sell their stuff?
[4:50:56] rephlex08: its the escalation of capitalism
[4:51:01] Ddorn34: What if there was a way to have it be one server but the content you had access depended on which version of the client installed
[4:51:03] seven__h: "I don't give a fuck, I'll go on my  dick shaped spaceship"
[4:51:07] demonzhunter: accelerated it maybe
[4:51:08] handstand_man: hella copium
[4:51:09] quickkill_: @elydas899 Yes
[4:51:11] spiked0996: dont hate the player hate the game
[4:51:17] H_9_K: Its true, but that doesnt mean employees shouldnt be paid better and be able to unionize safely
[4:51:18] Gashunk1: Most people just wanna chill with a good MMO doing random groups, that's what it is all about
[4:51:19] Deomas11: I you want to save small busineses, then give up overnight or even 2-3 day shipping. Nobody wants to.
[4:51:19] morat_g: Things aren't fair
[4:51:21] dmcollins100: Yeah..... they still hoard wealth and pay properly. They're fucked
[4:51:21] zerozuckerl: @seven__h is that shakespear?
[4:51:31] MysterialMan: But like, there was a toilette paper producing buisness, and amazon just set theirs to waaaay cheaper,  had amssive loss, until the toilette paper maker went out of buisness, and they raised the price again
[4:51:35] Jayceza: AI taking over
[4:51:36] Drunkenb33r: what lvl you going to wc at?
[4:51:39] boonegam: lol i remember printing profession guides
[4:51:39] Bahood: real ones just do it the OG way
[4:51:40] jacksunson: I look forward to the day when we all work for Amazon
[4:51:45] Mahca_: I blame sarthe Kappa
[4:51:45] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu That's sort of drug dealers saying "If I didn't sell the drugs someone else would" Bullshit argument
[4:51:47] TMMOOF: Cheat code book rentals from the school library? anyone? LUL
[4:51:48] gbaraldi1: Though I think we can stop ourselves by not looking so much at guides
[4:51:52] Hasbulladin: Adapt and move forward, don't wish for the past
[4:51:52] Alerothan: People are acting like they werent playing every game with cheatcodes passed around everyone in school
[4:51:54] stoekat: so today?
[4:51:54] Drunkenb33r: nice
[4:51:54] ZORIZE: Maybe AI will make games so unique that every content is gonna be unique and can't be looked up in the Youtube facit
[4:51:56] Suvantar: Yeah, you can't un-know what you already know.
[4:51:56] seven__h: @zerozuckerl ofc
[4:51:59] shadosavage: can't wait to live in the Amazon pod, and eat ze bugs
[4:52:00] Drunkenb33r: better safe then sorry
[4:52:07] Nitetrix2004: Is this paladin?
[4:52:08] gbaraldi1: ZORIZE I think AI will just make shit games

[4:52:28] heygoditsme: ye training day

[4:53:51] Weedweed: LG OLED C3
[4:53:52] saint_deniz: @tsetse2fly sadly the argument holds in so many areas, as long as money is involved it is most likely bound to happen.

[4:56:06] hersheyjh: Your troll shaman die?
[4:56:12] tsetse2fly: @saint_deniz I think we allow it to happen. And the thinking is very nihilistic which I oppose. There could be laws/guidelines/morals etc in place to not let it happen.
[4:56:15] shadosavage: deez harpies got zero chill

[4:57:18] espi: dual wield rune needs a pattern that drops from Sneed in Deadmines, it,s RNG if you can get it or not in Sodcore
[4:57:18] joonelius3: if you would get dual wield rune in ssf it would be a chad deed though.

[4:57:55] mlbAct: @xaryu you should be able to like shield bash or something like that as a shaman

[5:36:08] Gashunk1: basicaly
[5:36:10] Drunkenb33r: oh didn’t know
[5:36:15] pretty_cool_guy: its taunt is very weak

[5:36:43] guapp_o: good for peeling
[5:36:43] morat_g: Shaman is the least understood class in classic I'd say
[5:36:45] jimmynut1: use it before fire nova
[5:36:51] zagecssss: so lay it first ?
[5:36:52] m4w_13: weak target dummy

[5:37:01] pretty_cool_guy: shaman GIGACHAD
[5:37:02] playerpersonx: target dummy is often used as a taunt for body pulls tho so it works for that
[5:37:03] keithbryantseekins: absolutely
[5:37:04] cxn_r: Its great to gather before u pop fire nova
[5:37:06] Drunkenb33r: it’s cuz the totems lol
[5:37:08] Smugaloof: Shaman feels like DLC class
[5:37:08] jeneraljelly: Been playing shaman for 17 years i got all the info
[5:37:11] sarrgasso: could it pull threat off a healer?
[5:37:19] toniboy44: how do you see the threat on a mob??'
[5:37:22] Neggs15: stoneclaw into fire nova on trash for aoe works sometimes
[5:37:28] Drunkenb33r: I use to main shaman when cata was out and didn’t know that
[5:37:30] Drunkenb33r: lol
[5:37:31] mukulukku: it's really great for pulling off mobs when you accidentally pulled more than one mob though
[5:37:32] adam_brisbane: you get your healing totem quest at 20
[5:37:33] Gashunk1: Shaman (heman) THE MASTER OF THE UNISVERSE
[5:37:34] thunderiver: the stoneclaw debate again lol
[5:37:37] Drunkenb33r: didn’t have to use it tho

[6:44:47] SAMELLTV: pet is allowed to die
[6:44:47] playerpersonx: @exbang because shaman was pink in original vanilla and its the same in classic

[6:45:20] paraflashtv: *run
[6:45:25] boomski303: Much love <3
[6:45:27] Seoken1: I would sent pet in first for initial agro, let it get to 40% then you take over agro, then when you are at 50% have him pet growl/taunt and swtich back, then it dies @Xaryu
[6:45:32] zebercetanayurt: the orc finds it inappropiate to weat clothing
[6:45:33] mlbAct: @xaryu tell priest about the cloth shoulders on mob so he can have shoulders before they’re gone
[6:45:33] koltbhill: started wow for the first time and its kinda humbling lol from watching it looks almsot impossible to be bad at but im pretty bad right now lol

[6:45:51] sajuto_: the priest can heal the pet chat, it's not like the pet will slowly just die
[6:45:56] shadosavage: blockamine ftw
[6:46:01] playerpersonx: and 10% dr from way of earth so 52% dmg reduction
[6:46:06] Kazunya_Meowryu: @williwhite94 Xar has always been the dude to do tightrope shit that is crazy haha
[6:46:12] asloff: and that is specifically for mobs that are your level too, right?
[6:46:13] Gashunk1: diogenes superstars
[6:46:14] zerozuckerl: D:
[6:46:15] NutterCircus: Single Target tanking sucks for sham. You cant get enough blocks up.
[6:46:17] Seoken1: The agro order should be (Pet First to 50%, then you take agro, then you get to 50%, then pet growls/taunts back) @Xaryu Bounce it back and forth 3 times
[6:46:23] plumpus81: i stepped away - no leggings?
[6:46:24] morat_g: How did you block the frog? Critter don't attack lol
[6:46:26] mlbAct: @auphyr yeah otherwise classic don’t got achievement
[6:46:31] williwhite94: @Kazunya_Meowryu true hopefully he just doesnt getr crit on and hell live lol fingers crossed
[6:46:31] xNotorietyx: you let pet tank first 50% then spam penance and flash heal
[6:46:41] stankylank: if hunter has beast mastery rune its probably doable, w/o youre a little screwed
[6:46:50] sajuto_: @stankylank he does
[6:46:53] HEXEDstream: Maybe use the roaming slime like last run with rage?
[6:46:55] Mudkicker: there are some mobs at vardant
[6:46:55] Gashunk1: not even that
[6:46:56] xNotorietyx: guess priest might not have flash heal yet
[6:46:56] plumpus81: pet really should tank boss first
[6:46:58] Gashunk1: disciples
[6:47:02] Seoken1: you want to bounce agro back and forth between you and the pet at least 3 times for this to be most effective
[6:47:08] Mudkicker: ranged druids mostly
[6:47:11] Gashunk1: or not even that
[6:47:12] skytzi: but the buckler!
[6:47:15] Gashunk1: who knows
[6:47:16] bakeranders: @seoken1 I like that strat
[6:47:16] BoonesHQ: you can pull the ooze next to verdaan to have multiple targets hitting u
[6:47:32] StepBroDeej: what happened to xarmon?
[6:47:36] sajuto_: that's 100% not worth
[6:47:44] alpacabowldood: get 5 stacks off ooze
[6:47:44] stretchnut5: you needd bigger pulls belive me
[6:47:44] morat_g: Build up to 5 stack with ooze before fight
[6:47:52] bakeranders: @stepbrodeej ded
[6:47:55] NutterCircus: Just drag the mobs in the corner to boss for shield on boss?
[6:47:58] Seoken1: Pet takes initial agro>Xarstomp agros>Pet growl agros back>Kill
[6:48:05] eygton: once pet gets   just taunt
[6:48:08] widicuwous: do a pre-pull for shield stacks like a warrior
[6:48:30] Mpx_24: care the taunt can  miss
[6:48:31] Terror__D: can they be reissted? cause thats death if so

[7:20:10] iRayG2: dodge all day
[7:20:11] MEDICx87: totems
