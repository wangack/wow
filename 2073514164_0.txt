[1:59:59] catgay13: leavers are a plague in mid-to-top range keys
[2:00:01] ReSeT_VT: 'what do you mean by leavers?' 'oh people who leave'
[2:00:03] anxxylock: bro people leave above 20s because there's no point in being in the key if it's bricked
[2:00:04] moodsen: pull, die, alt f4, classic eu tank
[2:00:08] Kyrasis: Shared depletes would have pretty bad incentives.
[2:00:08] Cervantas: streamer privilege is strong here
[2:00:10] catgay13: idiots doing 26s and not understanding that 1 death isnt a deplete
[2:00:11] Cruzerthebruzer: Every time you wipe on a boss in raid you should have to kill the boss before it because the stakes aren't high enough

[2:00:37] Kyrasis: @Cruzerthebruzer Not just the one boss before, all of them.

[2:03:10] simonromlie: @Aylena_Evouline There would be some demons taking avoidable damage on purpose
[2:03:13] anxxylock: the problem is that this season there's so many people who have keys they shouldn't because the keys are a fuckin joke
[2:03:17] Akahashy: tbh when my key goes lower than 26 I don't even bother to play it again cause people is dogshit

[3:00:31] Raedin_: is thorncaller better than stats in this big of pulls?
[3:00:45] samdalle69: what is the record time in fall?
[3:00:50] ReSeT_VT: @Harleybane I feel like its just streamers trying to be entertaining with nothing particularly interesting in the match
[3:01:01] toastbam: i went from a cup to b cup
[3:01:08] SoiYa_TV: SoiYa_TV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 6 month streak! hi
[3:01:14] dorki: @Raedin_ no but overall is fake
[3:01:17] guffinlosthisaccount: @Raedin_ no, but it's better boss damage
[3:01:22] guffinlosthisaccount: the trash is gonna die anyways
[3:01:27] moodsen: @Raedin_ prio dmg
[3:01:32] guffinlosthisaccount: more boss dam is what'll actually speed shit up
[3:01:44] Harleybane: @ReSeT_VT i know but jb in perticular, i just zone out and then i dont understand a thing he's trying to say lol
[3:01:46] ReSeT_VT: you win the game by finishing the dungeon faster not by doing more dps on the meters
[3:01:49] Toadcop: yea fall is all about last boss dmg
[3:01:59] Toadcop: i always switch talents after second boss
[3:02:03] Toadcop: and trinkets
[3:02:12] cornflakes_au_getchop: u usually finish faster with more dps though
[3:02:13] Trentkinds: that throne!
[3:02:31] opacawc3: more dps could just mean aoe padding, which isn`t necessarily faster
[3:02:54] cornflakes_au_getchop: we talk mdi they aint here for padding
[3:03:15] Halt57: @Toadcop u hearth out and get summoned back in? seems like a waste of time
[3:03:21] seriousalsa: you could limit how many times you can ban a map
[3:03:35] almostdps: tgp format except with mdi keys? lowest overall time wins
[3:03:38] opacawc3: killing boss = faster, and killing boss = lower dps
[3:03:46] Toadcop: @Halt57 no, you use tp to dawn of infinite
[3:03:51] ReSeT_VT: @cornflakes_au_getchop you pull boss + 10mobs. you do full aoe -> you do 300k dps, the pull is over in 1 min. you do ST damage to the boss -> you do 150k dps, pull is over in 50 secs
[3:03:57] Toadcop: w8 till they all skip and go down and then you enter
[3:03:58] moodsen: 244k vs 255k
[3:04:02] Toadcop: usually you wait for them
[3:04:17] opacawc3: @ReSeT_VT yeah exactly, some ppl struggle to understand this i think
[3:04:19] zachl_: bands
[3:04:31] cornflakes_au_getchop: yea and you get % for mobs u wouldnt take 10sec to kill apart
[3:04:40] ReSeT_VT: it does not matter when the mobs die
[3:04:46] ReSeT_VT: if they die after 10 or 20 or 30 seconds
[3:04:47] Halt57: @Toadcop ah makes sense. just have to remember to not use port to get there then
[3:04:49] ReSeT_VT: the pull is faster
[3:04:56] cornflakes_au_getchop: k
[3:05:00] Toadcop: @Halt57 yes

[3:10:39] moodsen: 6 secs diffy
[3:11:00] LunaNovaXIV: @dorki what if you do you a payout on bald bandits right now to make up for the scam payout from the last match :)
[3:11:05] dashwinsta: @hashtagnothankyou You are making my point. It's boring to see the same 10 min dungeons each time. Time to make it harder to see more interesting matchups
[3:11:06] opacawc3: whats the advantage for rogue in this dungeon?
[3:11:18] fremen14: @dashwinsta its not boring at all tho?
