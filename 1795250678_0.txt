[0:20:50] Starblaster_1: carbin6Hello
[0:21:28] geokouts: we have voted for HC stream

[0:23:00] Hubba_Bubba: @geokouts ah that's why
[0:24:39] DovahChicken: Lost my 27 rogue Sadge  died do root+dot
[0:25:51] geokouts: best class for hardcore? Warrior it seems, or frost mage (just stay very far away :P )
[0:27:14] clambynature: hohhhly shmokes
[0:29:35] therealbrigade: LETS GOOO
[0:32:11] therealbrigade: Mage is currently 19

[0:41:41] reggiepowa: Do we even need blizzard to make their own hc if community thing is working well
[0:43:22] rosina_scarlett: no but blizz will so they can say they listen to the comunity
[0:44:18] rosina_scarlett: exactly
[0:44:21] twofingaz: Morning
[0:45:57] reggiepowa: I don't think the comparison is the same. Blizzard should make something actually new and interesting for classic instead of copying the thing that already exists
[0:45:58] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!

[0:48:54] rosina_scarlett: I just find it funny that people think Kargoz actually made HC.. when Ironman is a lot harder and is the same thing that has been around since 07 LUL
[0:49:15] TaranTactical: I jus get lured in by the “starting stream” pic. N wanted to find out what game is it.
[0:50:01] Piebringer619: yes but iromen was around cataclysm challenge
[0:50:08] Piebringer619: so it wasnt really a challenge
[0:50:16] rosina_scarlett: ???
[0:50:16] Piebringer619: vanilla is whole other beast
[0:50:19] rosina_scarlett: 07 was Original BC
[0:50:21] Piebringer619: in terms of leleving
[0:50:40] jarilrpg: yeah, i remember ironman starting in BC or very late vanilla
[0:50:43] rosina_scarlett: if they wanted to do True HC. white items only
[0:51:16] Piebringer619: well anyways it would not be challenge if HC existed in BC
[0:51:28] geokouts: HC is a very casual Ironman mode

[0:51:43] Shrenko: Hardcore on turtle wow is the best
[0:52:01] rosina_scarlett: even there you can use gear other then white items so it's not true HC
[0:53:23] Shrenko: Im doing Hardcore + Slow & Steady
[0:53:51] geokouts: basically HC is 1 death=delete, no grouping (ONLY for dungeons), no AH and NO trade

[0:58:04] PadidinJones: Nice!
[0:58:34] Effin_Steffin: Got Otto yesterday. I beat the expansion.
[0:58:37] ClassicMalcontent: I thought I heard Shaman Ankh is not allowed. I thought it should be as it's a class ability. But meh.

[1:04:34] poweredstern: poweredstern subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[1:04:42] kingceejay90: @jamesc398 you can group but the entire time u have to stay together

[1:05:00] EKS90_: @jamesc398 yes cause why follow the rules :)
[1:05:01] Sollice: @towelliee your charity pro am overlay thing is still on
[1:05:07] Shrenko: when Blizzard release official HC servers they need to have some sort of rewards for hitting 60
[1:05:39] OnceAMoose: If you don't plan on chatting, make sure you say something funny now, so that it shows that chat message when you die.
[1:06:00] TheItalianStallion321: has anyone made it to 60 yet?
[1:06:10] Z3ROR: @Shrenko And earlier milestones as well.

[1:06:23] TheRavenGrave: This is how WoW should have been
[1:06:28] EKS90_: @TheItalianStallion321 yes, a hardcore guild killed nefarian on a first ever hardcore BWl run last week.
[1:06:32] Herzenliegen: @theitalianstallion321 we had two people make it to 60 last night
[1:06:35] BoogieDuck: G'd Morning al!

[1:07:14] adxx: im on 3rd attempt of this haha. love this challenge but if i ever hit 60 im immortalizing. im not staying HC for raiding fuck that
[1:07:28] Broomba: imagine leveling up HC to 59, having a mount, 2,000 gold and die one bar to 60
[1:07:35] jamesc398: bro tbh we didnt even join the disc and read the rules lmao
[1:07:37] EKS90_: Hardcore has basically been a thing forever, it was mostly called ironman before, but then they popularized the hardcore version instead and made this addon that is super good.

[1:08:44] ClassicMalcontent: Some of this is nonsense but meh w/e not playing HC.
[1:09:20] Effin_Steffin: Classic DOWN BAD! Lol
[1:09:23] PvtHudson093: Chat did he get any good cards in the vintage card rip?
[1:09:38] EKS90_: its not that bad, bubble+hearth for instance is not allowed cause that would be the best get out of jail freecard in the game, same as ressurecction for Warlocks etc, would just make everything weird.
[1:09:38] TheRavenGrave: hmmm you can't farm the same dungeon but you can farm different dungeon ( but only once ) hmm
[1:09:47] tr4ncetv: then you get 1 shotted by raid trash mob

[1:21:15] prodpavka: @procyon_mfc blizzard CEO tweeted something about that yesterday so probably yes there will be official hc servers
[1:21:42] yyardar: @prodpavka he just asked if he should play i think, now he does :D
[1:21:48] Entropist7: there is a lot of story in the endgame of poe you're missing tho
[1:21:50] ArcaneSyntax: if this was hardcore wrath i might consider it, but classic has such awful class design
[1:21:52] Chuckforfun: @prodpavka mate he does now so many wow streamers ;D
[1:21:54] procyon_mfc: nice
[1:21:55] Chuckforfun: he can just talking

[1:23:16] PvtHudson093: That poor Hunter
[1:23:23] TheItalianStallion321: oh really?
[1:23:24] prodpavka: @yyardar there was leaked code about hardcore from official blizzard API or whatever, the CEO playing it or just tweeting idk just increases the chances of them making official hc servers so idk
[1:23:27] TheItalianStallion321: well thats fucked up....
[1:23:48] TheItalianStallion321: now im angry. what a fuckin child

[1:24:36] TheItalianStallion321: sorry Towel. thats upsetting if thats true.
[1:25:07] rosina_scarlett: was weird seeing Firedup on war
[1:25:47] TheItalianStallion321: may be a dumb question but would raider.IO investigate that son of a bitch?
[1:25:53] bd142001: That does suck charity or not
[1:25:54] Respls: If people signed up to throw that's ridiculous
[1:26:11] Respls: I'm sure some people signed up to actually do it
[1:26:16] Herzenliegen: That's when they don't get an invited back
[1:26:19] bd142001: Better vetting

[1:30:02] Herzenliegen: It wouldn't surprise though
[1:30:06] Herzenliegen: Me
[1:30:23] ClassicMalcontent: Its worse. 5yo do not understand half the time. That level of BS takes understanding to be that big of a PoS during a charity event no less.
[1:30:36] rosina_scarlett: @TheItalianStallion321 the hunter was 100% trolling. was surv, died ever boss and was under the healer most of the dungeons
[1:30:42] ronny_84: I’d only be torn if lula was also playing on a different group lol
[1:30:58] TheItalianStallion321: he d/c'ed like 100 times and died 200 times @TompsonX they also said he was deliberatly standing in mechanics and not moving

[1:33:16] TheItalianStallion321: @TompsonX well....lol that could be true too, he bought his scores but again, raider.IO should investigate and question these people more. do more research into the people they choose next time
[1:33:32] manmower: he was playing like your average Stormrage or Ragnaros player
[1:33:40] TheItalianStallion321: ultimately, this falls on raider.IO to choose people better next time IMO. lesson learned

[1:56:30] sphinix20: there is in different languages?
[1:56:51] procyon_mfc: Oh in the addon go to "NPC Greeting Playback Frequency" and change it to Play Once for All NPCs.  That way their greetings won't always repeat each time you open a vendor
[1:56:55] volkreig: Not using Elvui?

[1:59:12] HonestPhilosophy: Is that chatgbt thing an addon?
[1:59:31] bugcatcher19: is it true there will be fresh servers soon
[1:59:32] ClassicMalcontent: I'm enjoying DF chilling. I play some Wrath Classic dailies. DF weeklies. Then I can play other games. I enjoy DF personally due to the downtime it allows.
[1:59:49] Tyrou: Xar and Savix would most definitely want a clip to watch

[2:00:24] EKS90_: BS takes a looooot of mats its very tedious.
[2:00:25] Respls: Mining gives Stam buff
[2:00:25] adxx: Engineering for warrior is almost a must down the road. otherwise, alchemy/herb
[2:00:28] sethman93: first aid
[2:00:33] ArcaneSyntax: engineering is apparenlty bis
[2:00:34] EKS90_: engi or alchemy is my go to 100%
[2:00:34] procyon_mfc: alch is suggested in HC yah
[2:01:04] EKS90_: I would go engineering or alchemy, its the 2 "best" so to speak.
[2:01:32] ArcaneSyntax: Hammer Squad HC guild when?

[2:02:40] EKS90_: I have a warrior with alchemy and a paladin with engineering, on HC atm. would prob stick with those 2
[2:02:47] ty_ston96: it gets worse as you level
[2:02:48] Jamcal: Only at this level
[2:03:10] procyon_mfc: really? that sucks
[2:03:13] ClassicMalcontent: Yeah thats asinine.
[2:03:22] therealbrigade: @dizmal Yes
[2:03:37] Dizmal: cheers
[2:04:05] james_bah: retail is so boring lol
[2:04:26] Dizmal: what is the talking addon @Towelliee ?
[2:04:28] irWaffle: whats the server everyone is doing hardcore on?
[2:04:32] Eozilla: yesus the voice addon is nuts
[2:04:40] procyon_mfc: If you don't want greetings (non-quest text) played everytime you open a vendor or trainer, you can go to "NPC Greeting Playback Frequency" and change it to Play Once for All NPCs.  @Towelliee
[2:04:41] therealbrigade: @towelliee how are you liking the voiceover AI?
[2:04:45] EKS90_: classic HC with the addon for voice is very nice, chill, and a lot of fun retail hardcore seems weird and also why LUL I wanted a break from retail

[2:05:22] ClassicMalcontent: @Guyladriel Dragonflight is great. I play both Wrath classic and DF and both have good parts. Mostly classic I just enjoy visiting the old world and seeing the old UI. But DF dragonriding is what I always wanted flying to be.
[2:05:28] n0tl0wHS: how do you get it to start working do you need to relog? I installed Voiceover and did /reload but it wont play quest text yet
[2:05:57] futomara01: laborers not workers
[2:06:18] EKS90_: doing a playtrough on normal clasic just for the voiceover addon is 100% worth it. cause its so fucking immersive. @Towelliee
[2:06:23] therealbrigade: @towelliee are you familiar with the RestedXP questing addon? Are you specifically staying away for a different kind of questing experience?
[2:06:24] PadidinJones: but they are yellow!
[2:06:28] EKS90_: if people are not a fan of HC

[2:06:56] therealbrigade: @towelliee immersion does work I use both
[2:07:08] procyon_mfc: warrior is like the toughest in classic lol
[2:07:14] PhillyDilly18: What does the immersion add on do?
[2:07:24] PadidinJones: @Towelliee im surprised no one took your name lol
[2:07:37] EKS90_: Immersion + voice over AI = pretty neat experiance.
[2:07:39] therealbrigade: CHEST
[2:07:57] drewetling: porm stach overload
[2:07:57] Asreyya: downgraded buckler
[2:08:01] PadidinJones: Jebaited

[2:08:54] Falxftw: i just died on my mage :(
[2:08:55] thickcurves: man on HC the mines are dangerous
[2:08:57] xchaoskingsx: Mage is easiest cause of free food/water
[2:08:57] Xirmak: easiest to lvl
[2:08:59] mavericks312: mages are the main characters
[2:09:00] adxx: because mage and hunters are the best for the challenge.
[2:09:00] smile_for_the_mori: Can summon food and water much easier
[2:09:02] Herzenliegen: There's lots of warriors
[2:09:06] SlideCancelXDD: glad to see ya finally hop on the HC train @Towelliee been a long time coming brotherman
[2:09:08] tylive52: im a lock lol
[2:09:09] abracka_: all the mages just got the EDM on loop while they blizzard down 20-30 mobs
[2:09:09] maustercheese: at least you don't have yellow mobs that randomly aggro then travel literally through the world to get you
[2:09:16] adxx: so are hunters
[2:09:18] ClassicMalcontent: Rogues are nice IMHO
[2:09:21] PhillyDilly18: @commander_eggi what does the immersion add on do?

[2:09:33] manmower: no paladins imo
[2:09:33] jeffstaggs: whats the hardcore add on called?
[2:09:34] xchaoskingsx: So do you have to delete if you get ganked in pvp as well?
[2:09:36] ClassicMalcontent: Ammo and Meat for pets.
[2:10:02] Mrflip21: I just like druid I would probably play one of those if I did this type of challenge
[2:10:04] EKS90_: @PhillyDilly18 It makes quests easier to read/follow, and it ties in perfectly with the voice addon, I use it in retail too, it gives you a new quest window for accepting andd talking to npcs, and stuff
[2:10:12] Doordonot_: wait, you guys have to pay for food and water?
[2:10:14] EKS90_: @PhillyDilly18 Its n curse, its easier to look at it.
[2:10:19] PvtHudson093: you no take candle
[2:10:24] Asreyya: the bears around northshire have been gathering, bring me 10 of their asses

[2:11:21] DGTLtv: cant use at all

[3:47:44] Lasidor: FPS WoW
[3:47:49] pereadin: BACONNNNN
[3:47:52] Aravarth: @Shirey36 Bubble-hearth counts as a death because it's an "unfair class advantage"

[3:48:50] pereadin: @aravarth does the same thing apply to feign death?
[3:48:54] Shirey36: @aravarth Couldn’t that be said about mages teleports, Hunter/warlocks pet tanking for them? Everyone has some sort of advantage
[3:48:55] Aravarth: Oh man, what was that original vanilla addon that marked the map with locations of mobs etc.? Questhelper I think

[3:49:24] therealbrigade: @lasidor Voiceover
[3:49:28] Aravarth: @pereadin No, feign death doesn't count as a death. However, if you let your feign death expire (i.e., run its full course) and you die from it as a result (a bug), it still counts as you dying.
[3:49:39] DannyG757: whats your favorite zone to quest in?
[3:49:41] Lasidor: The hard part is staying alive when you pull like 10 Defias Mages.  I BET Defias Mages have the highest kill coulnt.
[3:49:49] Pr1m0x21: The hard part is having the patience
[3:49:59] GothmaN: for some, the challenge is reading apparently LUL

[4:13:02] ClassicMalcontent: Yeah of course a lot of deaths will be low level in HC. If you die and delete that means being a higher level there are fewer higher level HC players.

[4:33:28] procyon_mfc: ol
[4:33:29] valianya: Report in game, that griefing behavior is against WoW terms of service because its disruptive and malicious
[4:33:30] sphinix20: Ar

[4:34:09] ClassicMalcontent: This is why even in original vanilla I stopped playing on PVP servers as the griefing is nonsense. Was glad when WM Off became a default thing with the opt-in optional. Should have left a couple PVP realms but even non-PVP griefers are asshats too.
[4:34:09] FoxPixels: lol what a loser sniper

[5:50:37] Jakmuiz: yes
[5:50:42] CrunkyBrewster: yeah I dont bother i skip those quests.
[5:51:05] Xorph: @darqstalker as a duo or trio everyone has to be online at all times so it's hard to coordinate
[5:51:20] DarqStalker: gotcha
[5:51:33] dreamwalker213: EU had 5 people die in BWL the other day
[5:51:41] drewetling: id cry
[5:51:45] Datitanic: i thought once you reach 60 its over
[5:51:48] GitaxiasPrime: imagine being the healer that let the raid down
[5:51:51] Waylash: Have to lvl 2 characters at all times
[5:51:56] TheItalianStallion321: thats why i dont get this HC stuff. you're gonna die and wipe on a boss there goes your 2-3 months
[5:51:59] eddiej0323: is bloodsail primarily alliance or is there alot of horde players too?
[5:52:01] watchyobak: Is this faster leveling now? Like is this wrath servers?
[5:52:03] dreamwalker213: @dreamwalker213 yeah, that was rough
[5:52:04] the_bad_goat: Well guess Gary doesn’t get to roll need on that piece of tier gear now
[5:52:13] Flebboo: Hydraxian Waterlords
[5:52:14] jemilork: hydrax
[5:52:16] reggiepowa: hydraxian waterlords

[5:52:17] Barralgul: eu : Hydraxian waterlords
[5:52:20] killerteapotsftw: EU:Hydraxian waterlords
[5:52:42] DarqStalker: You better make really good friends with your healers or else they'll let you die lol
[5:52:45] Xorph: @theitalianstallion321 if you die at that point you might as well xfer off to a regular server
[5:53:04] Kaylakreeping: oh yeah dude
[5:53:08] Kaylakreeping: horde are so better
[5:53:13] TheItalianStallion321: @Xorph i thought you had to delete the character?
[5:53:24] Shrenko: Hardcore is not about rushing to 60
[5:53:29] WoW_StandalonE: and dont go into caves
[5:53:36] Kaylakreeping: @Xorph you just lie
[5:53:40] Xorph: @theitalianstallion321 you don't have to if you don't want to, you just have failed the hardcore challenge at that point
[5:53:40] DarqStalker: can you get battle rezzed? Or not allowed?
[5:53:51] mockingbird1241: it's that a private server or just an addon ?
[5:53:59] Tyrou: no bubble hearth
[5:53:59] tylive52: no bubble hearth
[5:54:00] dreamwalker213: @Xorph you dont have to delete, but you cant raid anymore
[5:54:02] ClassicMalcontent: Class abilities should be allowed.
[5:54:04] Molvonos: That seems counterintuitive.  Those're class tools.
[5:54:06] Dwaggle: no bubble haerth. No light of elune hearth
[5:54:16] Shrenko: @mockingbird1241 streaming private serverrs is not allowed. this is official server
[5:54:18] MeisterPetze: who can track bubblehearth?
[5:54:22] ClassicMalcontent: Yeah that's where I'm like no ty to HC
[5:54:22] Asreyya: that war just then: Sweet I made 10, *Dead*
[5:54:28] Xorph: @dreamwalker213 that's why I said transfer off instead of deleting your geared 60 lol
[5:54:29] Molvonos: That's stupid.
[5:54:37] tehaliii: bubble hearth is a guaranteed escape though
[5:54:37] tyclonic: I think that’s wrong. I feel like then mages can’t teleport or use their foods
[5:54:47] TheFox0228: what about just bubbling? is it just bubble+heart failure?
[5:54:50] tehaliii: it would make those classes way too op
[5:54:52] MeisterPetze: easy mode. Start the addon to creat a toon. turn off addon, level to 60, turn on addon.
[5:54:58] valianya: Can you Feign Death or Vanish/Invis(mage)
[5:55:02] tehaliii: bubbling is fine by itself
[5:55:03] Asreyya: agree
[5:55:03] dreamwalker213: i understand SS and ankh, because you do technically die
[5:55:04] Dwaggle: You also CHOOSE to play hardcore
[5:55:04] Spicey_McBrady: Death=Delete? My toon would last 5 minutes
[5:55:06] Barralgul: @ArasakaGer addons can track buffs and cast so it's easy to see
[5:55:11] DarqStalker: agreed if it's in your kit, should be allowed
[5:55:14] Tyrou: yes you can feign death and vanish
[5:55:14] Jarless: no light of elune and hearth either
[5:55:15] tehaliii: yes you can
[5:55:21] ClassicMalcontent: "YOu cannot stealth as a Druid or Rogue" kappa
[5:55:22] reggiepowa: you can feign death
[5:55:32] Mygdrayl: @ArasakaGer you can't addon track's the leveling process
[5:55:41] IchabodCrain: is this an official server theme? or just a bunch of players having fun?
[5:55:43] ikuep: way more ppl would play shaman and lock if it was allowed
[5:55:49] DarqStalker: Is there an official rules somewhere?
[5:56:19] TheItalianStallion321: wait you cant play lock or shaman?
[5:56:19] Yay2024: Class quest I think

[5:56:45] dreamwalker213: @TheItalianStallion321 you can, just cant use soulstone or ankh, because you are still technically dying and rezzing
[5:56:46] Xorph: do not
[5:56:47] Mygdrayl: @TheItalianStallion321 you can
[5:56:53] Barralgul: @TheItalianStallion321 you can play them you just cannot use soulstone or ankh
[5:57:06] Shrenko: hamstring + rend kiting is good
[5:57:10] TheItalianStallion321: oh ok. then i either misread whatever someone said earlier

[5:58:30] LeDerpski: you have to die if your partner dies i think
[5:58:32] tehaliii: if someone dies in duos the run is over
[5:58:40] mozavich: Those murlocs show no mercy
[5:58:41] Xorph: really recommend going to dun morogh and doing those 6-11 quests
[5:58:46] n0tl0wHS: yeah ur done
[5:58:49] tylive52: if one dies you both do
[5:58:57] dreamwalker213: yes
[5:59:02] Tyrou: yeah if your duo/trio dies you have to delete
[5:59:04] tehaliii: it helps mitigate the fact that duo and trio is easier
[5:59:12] tehaliii: bc if someone fucks up your run is over too
[5:59:38] Obsolete2885: If you are a duo or trio can you trade between yourselves?
