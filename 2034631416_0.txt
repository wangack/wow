[0:59:09] iTzHaL: Because you line it up with burst, and the pulls are shorter so it gets its full value while proc trinkets can get wasted
[0:59:10] Hinkelberg_TTV: Happy Birthday big guy!
[1:00:02] iTzHaL: basically burst matters more in keys than raid, and might of the ocean gets full value and other two often don't
