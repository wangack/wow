[0:52:28] Hoshma46: how does heroes of the storm have spaces in their twitch name? Susge
[0:52:30] hmm1113: Can you not group up to get the raging blow rune at all? I guess on alliance you could because the redridge part is part of an elite quest

[0:53:05] tummboi: PepeLaugh no shadow protection or fap for raid
[0:53:06] Emil129c: you can group if íts technically impossible
[0:53:11] L0stinthew00ds: @savix 100% their is a list of groupable runes
[0:53:12] Hoshma46: xar had a level 20 rune at level 3 so im sure
[0:53:14] Emil129c: but you can get all your runes solo
[0:53:15] Acework: ask Xar im almost certain

[0:53:54] nightswatch: no you can't for raging blow
[0:53:58] ChromieGnomie: Hiiii mr sandwiiiich
[0:53:59] nightswatch: 4. You CAN group for the following RUNES: PRAYER OF MENDING, LIFEBLOOM, ANCESTRAL GUIDANCE, FROZEN MAK’RURA, FROZEN MURLOC. All other runes must be done SOLO.
[0:54:05] Smihaa: AFELO HAI
[0:54:15] Madwo: SMOrc DrumTime

[0:54:47] Shakezulah22: just say aloud where you need ppl to be like Xaryu did with the starsurge rune fg
[0:54:48] funboix0x0: Hunters do that rune too
[0:54:48] Shakezulah22: gg
[0:54:50] epicninja808: why tf did they not put the warrior ones
[0:54:52] Acework: probably no one played warr
[0:54:52] epicninja808: actually throwing
[0:54:55] fellifell: I think they only put ones on the list that physically require 2 players like a summon
[0:54:56] funboix0x0: maybe some hunters happen to do that rune
[0:54:57] L0stinthew00ds: @savix the ones that are groupable legit require more than 1 person to interact with the object
[0:55:07] pipzer: just break the rules who cares
[0:55:13] L0stinthew00ds: Yes
[0:55:19] gelobangin: would the boys swap for you though is the real question ...
[0:55:19] nightswatch: The idea is the other runes REQUIRE another player to unlock the rune, where as warrior rune is nearly impossible solo but theoretically can be done solo
[0:55:23] tummboi: if most ppl went alch i think you guys got this aaaa

[1:27:34] hersftw: what preparations are left savix?
[1:27:35] alpacabowldood: ya gotta time it out so you're almost always enraged
[1:27:39] alpacabowldood: edging lol
[1:27:41] flikkmon: you just juggle around 80 all the time
[1:27:41] Hoshma46: basically just try to be at like 75ish when it's about to fall off
[1:27:42] realrednalooz: if you get tons of WF procs its GG
[1:27:48] swoozix: if it goes away or ur 12 swings are gone, just go down to 70, Windfury will most likely get you to 80 rage usually extremely quick
[1:28:08] chetterbancettv: dont execute
[1:28:16] cheezersmcb: once you build up its pretty easy to keep it on the edge, especially in boss fights
[1:28:18] Jaithys5150: DrumTime
[1:28:19] CitrusCatChise: @Savix wish me luck in Ashenvale om om
[1:28:19] flikkmon: only execute last hit on boss
[1:28:21] Jaithys5150: DrumTime  DrumTime  DrumTime  DrumTime
[1:28:25] swoozix: execute is nearly a dps loss unless you got enrage up whilst spamming it at like 10%
[1:28:28] pipzer: dont execute unless its the last global on the boss ofc
[1:28:28] Ragingdevils: execute only at the 5-10% point
[1:28:43] CitrusCatChise: you just kill some guards and gtfo @Savix
[1:28:49] StripSniper: consuming rage is all about edging that 80 NODDERS
[1:28:59] acaman: is pvp anabled in ashen?
[1:29:08] kittywizards: are u that kind of orc? SMOrc
[1:29:09] Teaff14: If you feel like PUMPING you can craft rage potions with alchemy ? will use a potion cd tho
[1:29:20] Teaff14: to go back to 80+ rage & refresh it
[1:29:28] CitrusCatChise: If I die I die for glory and honor

[1:36:57] CitrusCatChise: Im an idiot I forgot im tank and I basically was tanking om om om
[1:37:17] gelobangin: you need SMF brother
[1:37:18] Ervill1: consumed by rage is not better than 20% attack speed if you dont have raging blow and good gear
[1:37:18] Norcore: it is. you are fishing for wild strike procs
[1:37:18] jakaupr: Raging blow is insane
[1:37:22] esbi__: It is deff your best rune
[1:37:25] epicninja808: its the best but its not worth you risking hardcore character
[1:37:25] Norcore: and you're enraged for 20% more dmg
[1:37:26] chetterbancettv: single minded fury is only for dual wield
[1:37:31] Ervill1: last time saying it idc
[1:37:31] XaleEroomTV: Endless rage an consumed by rage
[1:37:33] epicninja808: its very small increase
[1:37:35] Kailes92: Kailes92 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! been a long time, good to see you still poping off in stream me Savix
[1:37:35] cheezersmcb: you do NOT need smf if you’re using 2h
[1:37:38] nightswatch: raging blow is like 5-10% more dps over other rune, not risking it for that
[1:37:40] chetterbancettv: raging blow, quick strike and consumed by rage are by far the bis runes
[1:37:40] Kira_Corpse: savixMonka the inn is sooo scary sir
[1:37:48] TheWhiteYuri: single-minded is for dual wielding
[1:37:48] flikkmon: BIS for 2h is Raging blow, Consumed by Rage and Quick Strike. for dual wield you swap quick strike for single minded
[1:37:50] CeeTeeM: smf is for dual wield
[1:37:51] draega1989: no balls!
[1:37:52] Toastedyogurt: I think frenzied assault is slightly better in open world/questing
[1:37:55] epicninja808: @nightswatch what this dude said
[1:37:56] jahvin86: sav edging us
[1:38:06] Clamsmasher24: SMF is dw only
[1:38:31] epicninja808: you have to clear inside house sav
[1:38:31] Ragingdevils: yea only with 2 1 handed weaps
[1:38:36] Toastedyogurt: the thing is inside that house theres like 4 lvl 30 elites
[1:38:36] epicninja808: and it pulls multiple when you go in
[1:38:40] epicninja808: so no one clears there
[1:38:46] Clamsmasher24: Rage pots make consumed by rage work well
[1:38:50] esbi__: It costs no rage it is huge
[1:38:56] jonquiereconnor: JUST RUN IN AND GRAB IT SAV

[1:39:29] TheWhiteYuri: raging blow is really good
[1:39:32] epicninja808: @esbi__ it is not huge
[1:39:32] Blakeasuarus: oh duh
[1:39:35] MochiMurloc: MyDemonsHaveFinallyCaughtUpToMe
[1:39:35] DirtyyFresh: Just die... its really easy if you die Kappa
[1:39:44] FeralTami: MyDemonsHaveFinallyCaughtUpToMe
[1:39:44] dinasourdickslam: flagellation is a solid choice if you cant go raging blow again bad on long boss (better than raging blow on some short bosses)
[1:39:44] gelobangin: no
[1:39:45] TheWhiteYuri: if you want to be alive, yes
[1:39:51] nightswatch: u can try getting flagellation
[1:39:54] gelobangin: raging blow bro
[1:39:56] swoozix: Raging blow would be too dififcult no?
[1:39:57] nightswatch: prob better than blood frenzy
[1:39:57] armored_zombie: Duskwood Rune
[1:39:59] gelobangin: trust me pump meters brother
[1:40:01] krillxdd: blood frienzy is meh
[1:40:03] swoozix: It's massive dps increase but its a hard one to get
[1:40:13] mrbeggin89: raging blow is to hard to slolo
[1:40:14] neighbor220: flagellation is the alternative to raging blow
[1:40:19] dispellmebro: maybe flagilation u can get? should be soloble
[1:40:21] Madwo: baseg fuzzy
[1:40:22] jahvin86: sav do a poll to see which is better
[1:40:25] andi2042: chat gaslighting streamer to die before raid for content HmmNotes
[1:40:25] Cosroka: Hey all !
[1:40:26] esbi__: For Flagellation you need group tho
[1:40:27] epicninja808: you cant get flag solo
[1:40:28] armored_zombie: Flagellation is best bet soloable
[1:40:31] Ragingdevils: yea aand i use that over raging blow myself
[1:40:31] TheWhiteYuri: duskwood
[1:40:32] swoozix: yeah
[1:40:33] epicninja808: bro these guys are fuckign cookked
[1:40:35] Uogien: Flagilation should be nice in duskwood
[1:40:36] armored_zombie: Just watch out for 35 elites patrols
[1:40:36] nightswatch: yeah a lot easier
[1:40:36] gelobangin: you can do raging blow just wait for others to kill lol
[1:40:40] StripSniper: not really mobs are 27-28
[1:40:42] dispellmebro: 25 Elite
[1:40:44] crazyboy1_: its harder to get
[1:40:44] shinra40: if theirs no undead ez if not its kinda annoying
[1:40:44] nightswatch: just kill a caster elite in duskwood
[1:40:46] dispellmebro: you hvae to kill
[1:40:48] crazyboy1_: in duskwood
[1:40:50] dispellmebro: but is soloble
[1:40:50] Synsora: @Savix as a SoD warrior main, rageing blow is a must. its a good chunk of your damage, gains you rage since it doesnt cost any, and is another ability to proc deep wounds since it can crit.
[1:40:53] cheezersmcb: flag is monka too tho
[1:40:59] Ragingdevils: o thats the crypt zone
[1:41:01] StripSniper: not much 2k
[1:41:02] dispellmebro: 2500
[1:41:04] Uogien: It's in crypt in DW

[1:41:11] gelobangin: if you get caught by mor'ladim ggs bro
[1:41:13] epicninja808: high level mobs on the way
[1:41:21] shinra40: mages also have a rune there so maybe one will be there to doing it
[1:41:22] epicninja808: like level 28 mobs all in that crypt
[1:41:23] funboix0x0: wtfwtfwtf
[1:41:23] TheWhiteYuri: the mobs around makes harder
[1:41:24] KrotonGG: 2,327hp
[1:41:24] nightswatch: just kick the cast he doesn't hit that hard
[1:41:24] JackWithMeat: HUH
[1:41:24] armored_zombie: Crypt also with 26-27 mobs MONKA
[1:41:25] mindreaper: wowhead says it is a 25 elite with 2327 hp
[1:41:25] epicninja808: I would not solo that

[1:41:45] neighbor220: the elite isn’t bad it’s the mobs to get to him
[1:41:55] epicninja808: high mob density in crypt
[1:41:56] dispellmebro: usually alot of ppl there for farming and mages has same quest line for mass regen rune
[1:41:59] fuzzywuzzyqt: Savix is my favorite cat streamer
[1:42:00] funboix0x0: miss chance is higher at 27

[1:42:28] epicninja808: skip chest rune fs sav
[1:42:37] StripSniper: mobs there are 27-28, they will be big issue and morladim will fuck you and your wife if he sees you MONKA
[1:42:43] KrotonGG: When you have feral in grp you'll be pumping. I wouldn't risk it at all for raging blow or flagellation bro

[2:39:43] Grubjaw: Those Silverpine flower bots that were picking the area clean around you had me om om
[2:39:45] msmester1: reagent vendors can sell them
[2:39:51] myst_u: Guzi is lvl 24 @Savix
[2:39:55] thenothing93: you can get rank 2 scrolls that are better then the potions

[2:41:40] lordshawarma: that's insane gonna level alts then
[2:41:44] morat_g: That's where he got them
[2:41:49] Thrabob: Undercity has a scroll vendor too
[2:43:13] JomppaPomppa: runescape has that
[2:43:13] Seabrax: groupcore
[2:43:19] morat_g: Like duo in the original hc server
[2:43:29] msmester1: hardcore gruppen Pog
[2:43:38] Shepp22: so kinda like duo hardcore from back in the day
[2:43:56] Munkeeboy007: so you want a trio+2
[2:44:08] bulljr3: I don't get why they would want everyone to be an alchemist, does that mean no other profs until level 60, who knows if the level 40 and 50 raids need pots also
[2:44:17] animeprawn: in osrs the group ironmen you share a bank too!
[2:44:22] Seabrax: RuneScape has multiple Ironman/hardcore modes. they have a good system. (I know you hate rs from those damn school kids) but they have solid systems
[2:44:33] Madwo: fuh
[2:44:36] JomppaPomppa: in runescape u also have a shared bank
[2:44:43] Munkeeboy007: do you have to play together, or just ony when the other person is online?
[2:45:01] bulljr3: I get that, but why not trade once 25
[2:45:16] billybrown95: dont die
[2:45:21] thenothing93: did you end up getting shadow resist pot?
[2:45:38] Seabrax: @bulljr3 because the ads on sucks and won’t read it as max leve when next phase comes so they’ll all be failed
[2:45:57] thenothing93: nice
[2:45:59] Munkeeboy007: so we always have to be in the same zone?
[2:46:07] suffixbob: @Savix How do you think ret will perform in pvp phase 2? :D
[2:46:07] blueccoli: @bulljr3 because 25 is not max level when phase 2 comes out
[2:46:21] Munkeeboy007: did you see espi died?
[2:46:40] Terror__D: i just realized something...you cant get meta rune on warlock in SodCore lol

[2:47:16] Munkeeboy007: you "can" get it
[2:47:21] Munkeeboy007: but its going to be difficult
[2:47:23] cereal_675: you need to do some parts to get the SFK part, other than that
[2:47:28] bulljr3: so if level 40 raids need pots then everyone has to stay as a alchemist. that is why I think they should be able to once make level for that phase.
[2:47:51] Madhouse61: dabu is looking fire with that drip
[2:47:51] cereal_675: i did meta solo on non-hc but had like 3+ deaths
[2:47:55] jonquiereconnor: ITS AS IF YOU'RE NOT USING THE RIGHT ADDON FOR THE RIGHT GAME
[2:48:00] Madwo: i did do a little drawing, savix xuh but im not sure how to feel about it
[2:48:06] SkumbagXtazy: I dont think its realistic to say you can, the tower in darkshore is INSANE even at 25, solo, 28-29 mobs with voidwalkers that slap, that content should be grp  available
[2:48:07] fewme: im smoking them sorry iuh

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA.

[5:15:46] Zombieblazer: give to guzu
[5:15:48] dispellmebro: frenzied with windfury

[5:16:25] rocky892: it’s xaryu’s he won the roll
[5:16:27] sukkerfugl: Consumed is much better + frenzied doesn't work when you sword and board

[5:18:06] Kazunya_Meowryu: I’m on mobile I can’t see it Sadge
[5:18:08] Pitchbas: Consumed is better 100%.
[5:18:09] bagenjoyer: sav getting juiced
[5:18:09] alexjmartens: frenzied assault doesnt boost bleed damage like CBR

[6:27:10] smallfry503: guzu had a penance wave inches from u
[6:27:11] Freekill_00: @Savix Even if he focussed dmg, that might've been the play. Yall see how close it got in the end

[6:27:20] ye1l: i mean if he heals more he does less damage and people end up taking more damage, who the fuck knows if it changes anything

[6:27:47] balisticbeats: @i2fat2kidnap duo with rogue who died so he had to die also

[6:28:20] gelobangin: Bro Rav better not throw this lol
[6:28:25] SlimeYeah: feels like everyone played the fight pretty well, think a comp with 2 priests instead of 2 druid might have made the difference
