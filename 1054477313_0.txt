[0:58:56] brandon_tapartos: my rotty sleeps for 12 and runs none stop for 12 lol
[0:59:04] Marmoh: Would be nice if you could just communicate with asmon without a million people interfering
[0:59:27] Noshpan: My shih tzu sleeps as much as a cat. And that's besides the fact that she's also 12 years old
[1:00:05] Senaries: TBC tanking or Retail tanking? what do you prefer?
[1:00:07] Noshpan: If he doesn't care for FFXIV's story, then I would recommend a boost.
[1:00:43] blucifer1320: Fuck that
[1:00:56] brandon_tapartos: 1-80 tanks forever in ff14.  can do 5 or 6 wow alts in that time
[1:00:59] TheOGMed: TheOGMed subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:01:00] blucifer1320: I didn’t even do that with wow and I played from the start
[1:01:02] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: i started that game day one and no way could i watch and read it all. it reminded me too much of xenosgaga and the one hr play time 3 hr cut scene
[1:01:37] Ballavar: man levelin as resto suuuck when your group for dungeons isnt on
[1:01:40] ThatsNotMyPoo: 30+. but it really doesn't get really good until around 50+ I think
[1:01:57] kwildonut: i didnt get invested in story till legion tbh
[1:02:05] Marmoh: He’s invested in wow’s story in a way, but that just happens naturally when you play it for 16 years
[1:02:06] Tanaros: It took me 60 in game hours to get to lvl 50 and get from AAR to Heavnsward
[1:02:10] mystikfarie: ARR sucks. Heavensward is AMAZING, and the rest of the expansions are pretty good too. The difference with 14 and WoW is the fact that you have to unlock a LOT of things
[1:02:18] devoted_bee: Talking about Asmongold?
[1:02:19] Noshpan: I just hope that his community doesn't sour him on FFXIV before he even gets the opportunity to give the game a fair try
[1:02:20] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[1:02:23] Vile_: Asmongold's opinion on FFXIV isn't going to change the opinion of those who enjoy the game, though.
[1:02:31] idenkaz_: he will call it dogshit no matter what
[1:02:39] Noshpan: Precisely, Vile
[1:03:15] Thoreya: he had like a panic attack today and ended stream
[1:03:20] Vile_: No matter what he says about the game, it sincerely isn't going to matter. If it sways the opinion of his chat or whatever, that's one thing. I wish him the best with it and I hope he enjoys it.
[1:03:21] Vexxsis: @towelliee  I think ppl need to fuck off and leave him be..let the dude play
[1:03:22] blucifer1320: It’s that or sub bro. It’s quicker then a tv commercial break. Sucks to be poor lol
[1:03:28] Bleedon4: That chat is..like the only reason I wouldnt want him to play. I like Asmongold as a person. But that Chat? DMAMN
[1:03:44] ChunkyJay22: jejames2005 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:03:53] Vexxsis: his chat is fucking annoying
[1:04:28] Thoreya: i think asmon tries too hard to please his viewers..idt he wants to play FF at all but is gonna do it bc everyone wants him to
[1:04:29] Ballavar: #FACTS
[1:04:30] Thoreya: which sucks for him
[1:05:08] Vile_: The thing about FF is that the story is the initial draw because, like it's been stated, the gameplay can be a little barebones/dry until level 30 or so.
[1:05:22] T0MMYT: T0MMYT gifted a Tier 1 sub to WIFEY_OF_T0MMYT! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel!

[1:06:02] L1ghthoof: lulaPop
[1:06:08] Marmoh: BC has captivated me in a way classic never did, and I feel bad for wanting to thank the boost for that
[1:06:20] TheOGMed: TANKS only!
[1:06:20] Vexxsis: I think he would enjoy alot of the fights in 14 tbh but will be hard with chat breathing down his neck
[1:06:30] TheOGMed: We have a ton of heals
