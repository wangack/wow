[0:11:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: omg they want the tank trinket
[0:14:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would think fewer pulls than Tindral, for sure
[0:15:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: "In a grand finale to Amirdrassil, the exhausting progression against Fyrakk the Blazing took Echo 344 pulls, second only to Tindral Sageswift's staggering 399..."
[0:15:44] dguap: fyrakk needs to hit leg day
[0:17:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: That axe, tho

[0:19:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: With the legendary, there are bad luck protection things that drop every time they don't get it
[0:20:21] Noshpan: My luck is so sus that I don't believe in bad luck protection
[0:20:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Then once it actually drops, it drops as an item that starts a quest chain for it that requires some world stuff and crafting to make the real axe
