[1:02:25] Vashiiq: we have no time in pre patch sodapoppin
[1:02:26] genghisbong: it should be 3x at least because we only get 2 week pre-patch
[1:02:26] willponting: post on forums confirming they've overnurfed it
[1:02:26] Chaddlulz: Just leave as 10x and remove all honor and badges on TBC Release
[1:02:26] Lanfear9k: nope
[1:02:26] nodiggityx: NO CASUALS
[1:02:26] phoenixfire7112: yes just leave it 10 times honor, fvck it

[1:02:35] millinoid: r14 weapon in literally 2 hours OMEGALUL
[1:02:35] Chillybirds: the problem is that the current version is scaled around a month of prepatch not 13 days. honor given should be changed to scale with that 13 days @sodapoppin
[1:02:35] angstwl: find a middleground since prepatch was 1/3 of the time of the original one.
[1:02:35] biggreech: no they didnt
[1:02:36] NaddaFadda: no, just fix the HK honor so it levels out
[1:02:36] overrrlord12: LOL
[1:02:36] Omegaboyhd: just make everything 10 times as costly
[1:02:36] Roggay: There is still an HK bug
[1:02:37] dad_blaster: they didn't. they overnerfed it. should be getting 600~ for wins
[1:02:38] Deltaxon: they should at least make a 200% or 300% honor event for the short prepatch time
[1:02:38] KampGaming: no there is a good post, it was around 4.7-5
[1:02:38] Seriousj91: you already honor capped soda

I would love to tell him every night “I love you” and rub his feet while he is streaming. We would go out when he isn’t doing gamer stuff and have fun together. He is also really good at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own BF. I love boys who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date Soda

Alright, if you want me to remind you, I have damage dealt by thorns increased by 4 and duration increased by 50 percent - that's a 15 minute buff of a solid 33 nature damage. Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.
