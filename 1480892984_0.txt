[0:47:01] abracka_: holy shit that is a lot of addons

[0:47:41] abracka_: people are using 3rd party tools for the new ultimate difficulty content, akin to DBM basically.
[0:48:15] bypized: I see that a lot of people use Reshade, is that allowed?
[0:48:21] Broomba: Ripple effect
[0:48:53] ditaern: u just can't stream having Add-ons. Always been like that. Every 1-2 years they just remind the community and some trolls mass report streamers and they get 3-10 day ban
[0:48:58] abracka_: a lot of the FC's had members there specifically creating the mods/etc for raid mechanics, the same way echo/liquid did for race for world first
[0:49:19] Darquesoul: Yoshi P is trying not to split hairs so he stands by the no addons allowed
[0:49:32] Broomba: Ff14 is a game that is not centered around a wow World first race
[0:49:46] Darquesoul: but some addons have been tolerated with caveats
[0:49:57] mayonaes: The other issue was the guy that got banned, they are adding the addon to the official ui. So they banned him and then came out and said they will add that addon lol
[0:50:04] Darquesoul: they had addons visible on screen
[0:50:06] azell117: they still use them, they just dont show them now
[0:50:11] Darquesoul: they aren't allowed
[0:50:45] Darquesoul: Gpsoe is tolerated until someone posts a sexualized lalafel and then he will ban them too
[0:51:05] herku44: If you use actual third party Softwareaddons which mess with geame from the outside Blizzard will ban you really quick. We just don't have to use such programs in wow because the addon support is great.

[0:51:31] bypized: Whats bad is the fact that its something that wasnt approved by them. I guess thats what it is
[0:51:34] Akermay: Just read about WowUp not working with CurseForge on Wowhead. Stick with WowUp or CurseForge a good client?
[0:52:01] Darquesoul: that's taking what he said out of context @bypized
[0:52:14] Darquesoul: you are actually quoting Xeno
[0:52:37] Darquesoul: Yoshi P is against damage meters
[0:52:43] Kaype92: @towelliee have you seen wow’s darkest secret video?
[0:53:46] zsoltix30: Hello Towellie! Nice to see you today streaming :)
[0:53:50] abracka_: that falls under it too
[0:53:58] Darquesoul: No addons
[0:54:07] Kaype92: He made a new video called wow’s forgotten secret a week ago lol
[0:54:09] Ironcladd: no addons are allowed
[0:54:09] ditaern: @Towelliee Unless your streaming then it's fine. But if you stream then players can report you and you could be banned
[0:54:10] the_bad_goat: the_bad_goat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! Yo keep up that good work towel
[0:54:17] abracka_: more than likely lol
[0:54:20] Darquesoul: you can't split hairs
[0:54:22] azell117: its against ToS technically, but devs wouldnt actively look for it, it would need to be reported
[0:54:22] abracka_: with the warpath they're on atm
[0:54:23] ditaern: IF people reported it, yes
[0:54:25] wisperuna: Ooo we talking about FF
[0:54:32] akaari5486: are u playing ff14 ?
[0:54:42] wisperuna: Well you know it will come as a feature  in some patches :D
[0:55:00] herku44: WEll you can use all Addons that FF supports ingame without 3rd Party tools. So none. xD
[0:55:03] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[0:55:04] Darquesoul: this is one of those situations that doesn't require much thought
[0:55:13] Morpserie: #LeaveTowelAlone KEKW
[0:55:17] azell117: which, the main issue recently is FF purists are witch hunting mod users on both NA and JP communities
[0:55:30] Darquesoul: if you are gonna ignore the TOS, and we all do from time to time, just don't tell others or show it
[0:55:38] Broomba: Towelliee doesn’t do a Quinn in ff14
[0:55:52] Gravirtus: its been awhile since i watched this early in the morning, no more epic intro?
[0:55:54] Thoreya: Sounds very cringe
[0:56:01] wisperuna: Well now we have the KKK of the FF community
[0:56:03] enux337: witchhunters jeez monkaS
[0:56:04] Artful_Dodger: I'm a normie.
[0:56:05] Thoreya: Cult like shit
[0:56:06] falldrgn: doesn't Yoshi P, know they are used.. just says don't be a dick about it?
[0:56:08] ashwing_: Lovely community over there nothing like WoWs Kappa
[0:56:09] Jokervenom1978: Why do peeps say FF14 isnt toxic?
[0:56:13] jerexify: @Towelliee called me normal, so it must be true. Suck it everyone else.
[0:56:31] dutchie76: ESO soon!
[0:56:41] countrycount: but i thought the ff14 community is the most wholesome community in the world? xD at least that's what they tell me^^
[0:56:41] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[0:56:44] falldrgn: why the witch hunt? I thought it just wasn't talked about
[0:56:47] dngrslythicc: Mostly normal! The was that one time when we all shit on our beds and recorded it in support of Amber Heard.
[0:56:47] Niksen_99: Is the gameplay fun ?
[0:56:50] Niksen_99: In FF
[0:56:52] Darquesoul: no one who plays ffxiv should have an addon issue because they aren't allowed
[0:57:01] Broomba: Just don’t ff14 needs add ins
[0:57:02] dracullus: people complain about wow community, but ff community is number 1 reason why I won't touch this game
[0:57:02] dyslexican1: I honestly thought the community in wow was toxic and cutthroat, till i messed around with other MMOs. It made me realize that the people that play wow are shockingly sane. The level of gatekeeping for things like that is insane in many other communities.
[0:57:03] wisperuna: It's a different mentality
[0:57:03] Broomba: One
[0:57:16] Darquesoul: you will never log in to ffxiv and need a dbm to do a dungeon
[0:57:17] Thoreya: So glad I never bothered with that shit LUL
[0:57:26] ditaern: @Niksen_99 Same as any other tab-target MMO.
[0:57:42] Chuckforfun: Today some ESO? or just a meme?
[0:57:51] wisperuna: Man try wow with no addons :D
[0:57:56] Darquesoul: for normal content, you won't need a single add on
[0:58:09] wisperuna: Be a FF purist in a WoW tell us hte experiance :D
[0:58:09] azell117: playing ff for so long has made wow dungeons hard for me because of how formulaic ff dungeons are
[0:58:17] Kaype92: How you like survival hunter so far? Got your tier set yet?
[0:58:17] dutchie76: kek
[0:58:19] herku44: What they use in FFXIV and call that "Addons" would get you banned also in WoW. No 3rd Party Software which messes with ingame stuff allowed.
[0:58:24] Gargazet: FFXIV makes the encounters not need addons in my opinion. although you're not getting any headup on what's about to happen like DBM does.
[0:58:33] MarquisLek: yesterday it was LFR today its normal, when will we do heroic lolol
[0:58:52] dutchie76: i wonder if the dps rankings with stay the same in Season 4
[0:58:58] dutchie76: for mythic +
[0:59:04] Darquesoul: you just watch the screen like you used to do in Wow @Gargazet
[0:59:12] abracka_: it's over
[0:59:28] jerexify: @Towelliee Have you been using a contract for the rep? That helps a little bit.
[0:59:34] Kaype92: Your dps is gonna skyrocket MASSIVELY once you get 4pc on your hunter it’s literally broken how much it goes up
[0:59:46] herku44: @Gargazet The problem is, Blizzard began designing encounters around addons like DBM.
[0:59:48] Darquesoul: we used to have to look at the boss for "tells" in Wow, or listen to the boss emoting
[0:59:51] dutchie76: @Bargil92 yea i am MM hunter LUL
[1:00:28] Kaype92: @dutchie76 I went up like 2k dps ST just from going from 3pc to 4pc on my survival lol

[1:00:56] dutchie76: MM is like 8th

[1:01:52] Kaype92: @dutchie76 technically tied for 2nd or 1st however you see it after destro overall since destro isn’t great on ST while survival is consistent at it

[1:37:57] entgrove: he's going crazy, can't believe its you
[1:38:02] archbishup: We mess with him a bit so he thought we were trolling him.  Like "OK, its Towliee, nice guys, hold on I think Asmon is calling my phone" was hilarious were like, no troll this time
[1:38:31] mateolaa: i just got tiny tina one
[1:39:27] KingSpud91: Anyone got the wow playlist towelliee is using?
[1:41:00] zyntak_: wtf

[1:41:49] Mazerbeam: Time go back to manually installing addons like the good ol' days!
[1:42:00] Gravelode: wow music pandatvLove pandatvLove
[1:42:27] The16BitNoodle: After doing heroic nath and some mythic, took a long break are the other two raids worth doing or should I just stick to the last one for now?
[1:42:35] IronPhalanX: got anymore of those addons
[1:42:38] reaperofbeardz: im pretty sure wow had addons back in classic as well, just rare and not used as much
[1:42:40] reggiepowa: curse aint that bad when you disable all the things in the options
[1:42:59] Gravelode: higher music pandatv1 pandatv2 pandatv3
[1:43:26] Mistery836: problem with wow atm is that I'm running out of things that I really wanna do KEKW
[1:43:27] abracka_: the addon manager wars have begun
[1:43:27] headshot_hunter6: i still use wowup
[1:43:33] Mazerbeam: It's not Blizzard's API
[1:43:37] Mazerbeam: It's Curse's
[1:43:40] mavericks312: maybe a quiet partner
[1:43:41] dimofodi: The API is to access the CurseForge server, it's not Blizz
[1:43:42] wolvepg: Nothing to do with blizzard
[1:43:43] jorgen__d: Its not blizzareds api its about, it curse api for curse services
[1:43:50] PrimalRain: it's curse's api they were using
[1:44:06] Colt_Engineer: they need a healer?
[1:44:07] Deadcells: What is the difference between the two?
[1:44:12] Mazerbeam: Devs release addons on Curse. Other apps like Wowup use the curse API to just pull from their "store"
[1:44:13] c0mmander_starscream: INB4 Blizz makes their own API
[1:44:23] Stonefather: Not bored enough to resub yet Keepo
[1:44:23] Colt_Engineer: Thrallcolt on your friends list
[1:44:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: no heal me only dps, me also work Kappa
[1:44:26] Tidewell: teamwork in action
[1:44:27] PokerFaceMoose: when you search for an addon on wowup it pings off curse forge which uses curses API.
[1:44:32] mmo_kenna_: have raider io got a partnership with wow now?
[1:44:36] dimofodi: @Towelliee they aren't preventing people from getting the add-ons elsewhere, just not allowing people to use other interfaces to get from THEM.
[1:44:40] Mazerbeam: That's the API curse is restricting
[1:44:51] Mazerbeam: All devs have to do is release on other apps
[1:44:57] Mazerbeam: which is just time consuming
[1:45:02] QuigsTV: @towelliee did you see they got rid of valor cap and lowered the cd on protoform synthesis?
[1:45:08] Deadcells: Why do people hate curse so much
[1:45:26] dimofodi: I use WowUp
[1:45:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: if my addons stop working i will just stop using them instead of dealing with curse
[1:45:29] dimofodi: Sad day
[1:45:31] reggiepowa: its rly not as bad as ppl present it to be
[1:45:34] sh1asurprise: Its not that other APIs are not accessible its that some Addon authers only upload their addons to curse and not wago or github
[1:45:35] abracka_: @Deadcells overwolf is what they dislike not curse
[1:45:51] Poiuykk66: CurseForge is good idk why people hate on it? Easy to use
[1:46:00] abracka_: LOL
[1:46:05] Frank4LuLz: i play UWUcraft
[1:46:06] kirtyalex: LUL
[1:46:07] swordart2022: @deadcells people don't want only one thing for addons
[1:46:08] MarquisLek: please we play ffxiv
[1:46:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: and new world
[1:46:10] c0mmander_starscream: lol I quit Lost ark
[1:46:13] Karper69: how dare you, im playing habbo hotel
[1:46:14] headshot_hunter6: isnt curse FULL of spy ware
[1:46:16] morp1onz: I could heal, but I'm working
[1:46:20] Deadcells: @abracka_ why do people hate overwolf?
[1:46:20] Zettabyte: towUwU
[1:46:21] dimofodi: @Poiuykk66 are you able to update ElvUI through it?
[1:46:34] Deadcells: I’m at work Towelliee otherwise I’d come
[1:46:35] Mistery836: If I liked prot warrior a lot but am a became a bit bored of the spec. what would be something to switch to 🤔
[1:46:37] nephttv_: @poiuykk66 it's more so cuz it's run by overwolf
[1:46:49] Poiuykk66: @dimofodi I don’t use elvui
[1:47:07] nchester51: overwolf not that bad just disable it at startup and turn of hardware accel when it open
[1:47:07] Poiuykk66: I close overwolf it’s never even open / used idk what it is 😂
[1:47:17] TheCliffyShow: I've been using CurseForge, and I don't see the problem with it.
[1:47:17] abracka_: @Deadcells it uses a lot of resources, plus ads. at least from what i understand about it
[1:47:17] reggiepowa: yeah
[1:47:30] soysos91: !alpha
[1:47:30] Moobot: @Soysos19 WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/encrypted-10-0-dragonflight-build-now-on-wowdev-server-326816 || Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[1:47:31] Mazerbeam: They should just rev split for API
[1:47:38] Lightninghandz: @Poiuykk66 Unless you go in and disable all the overwolf settings, it starts the minute you turn your PC on in the backround
[1:47:45] kniteoflitetv: Yo is this Alpha?
[1:47:47] Mazerbeam: I doubt people using WowUp are going to switch to Curse
[1:47:56] Colt_Engineer: whats the group?
[1:48:04] Poiuykk66: @lightninghandz so press the little pop up button snd close it or disable it launching at launch? It’s not that big a deal surely

[1:48:40] Poiuykk66: People complaining about an issue you don’t have to deal with. God I love the internet
[1:48:41] archbishup: Curse has people on staff who manage the database they have, and has to pay for the bandwith to support a place like wowup pulling every updated addon they have every day.  I get it from a business standpoint, why for free enable my competitor, but I hate it as a user.
[1:48:54] Colt_Engineer: I don't see it listed
[1:48:57] mavericks312: sloot out here trying to start a riot

[1:50:07] Lightninghandz: @Poiuykk66 Well seeing as how I work in Networking for a living I'm quite aware of what types of data are being pulled from peoples PC's.
[1:50:23] Poiuykk66: People moan about cosmetics and micro transactions cause they can’t afford to buy them week in week out like other people. I will die on that hill LUL
[1:50:35] QuigsTV: @towelliee can you fill me in on the addon thing going on rn?
[1:50:43] bypized: Not gonna lie, its like a cult
[1:50:48] c0mmander_starscream: The Knights of Asmonite's are on a holy war on addons
[1:50:48] mavericks312: the ff14 community is fine until you find out the cultish side

[1:55:00] Dinguz: What's this about Addons? Haven't followed wow news for while, but I've seen a few people tweet vaguely about addons being banned?
[1:55:18] mark20059: and this is why wow will always be better than ff14
[1:55:20] TuRDz__: FF14 players are a fuckin CULT, go into asmons stream and look at how them clowns act over that game
[1:55:45] upinurguts: @TuRDz__ thats not a FF14 thing thats an Asmon thing
[1:56:01] swordart2022: @turdz__ people online =/ people in game.

[2:05:03] Taz_85: Can't say I've ever seen much toxicity coming out of GW2, although I'm sure there's some
[2:05:15] dimofodi: He's probably having tanks take them out because he trusts 2 tanks to take to the right spots and DPS always to the middle, keeps it simple for DPS he can't rely on.
[2:06:18] Okletral: The DPS is crazy I can’t even get a raid group to get this boss down that fast the portals annoying too
[2:06:22] Taz_85: Most players I've talked to in GW2 are just there a nice reprieve from the frustrations of their main MMOs LUL It's not nearly as cutthroat

[2:43:29] Bayne77: give us less but force me to leave my garrison and talk to people

[2:48:30] MedicineMan: Grinding isn't bad, @Sylphy_TV . But FORCED grinding (Torghast for Soul Ash) is bad
[2:48:34] Rudric_Ice: @swordart2022  I'm just talking bout the casuals not me
[2:48:54] swordart2022: @rudric_ice ?
[2:48:57] 91Niki: I mean the worst issue with gathering professions atm is the insane amount of bots right now. Zone herbs barely spawn atm, it's filled with the Death Blossom because bots don't care to pick those. I could easily report 20 bots every day if I wanted to spend the time doing so.
[2:48:59] Sylphy_TV: @MedicineMan Ye, I can see that.
[2:49:14] Meakis: @medicineman truth, like reputations during tbc, wrath and cata ( can't talk about mop i missed it )
[2:49:14] swordart2022: @medicineman This staff dude is onto something
[2:49:42] swordart2022: @91niki well report them and they get banned.
[2:49:46] 91Niki: @MedicineMan I mean grinding isn't bad in general. But grind that isn't rewarding is bad. That is the main issue with Shadowlands atm

[2:50:10] Aquadriel: man i love this boss, both post and pre nerfs on hc is still fucking fun and chaotic.
[2:50:18] Meakis: @91niki the zone herbs share spawn with death blossom wich are much less usefull
[2:50:19] 91Niki: @swordart2022 I shouldn't have to report them. Blizzard can easily use the heatmap method to see bots vs real players.
[2:50:54] swordart2022: @91niki There is crime happening! don't tell police! don't whine then
[2:51:00] 91Niki: @Meakis Yeah. Literally go to any zone right now. Especially on Illidan. It's so hard to find zone specific herbs. and that's cuz bots are fucking the spawns over by mass farming
[2:51:07] Niksen_99: Grinding rep in TBC classic back in Phase 1 was brutal.. Not like a few thorgast comon

[2:53:48] Fugazi811: An Aff Warlock sighting omg
[2:53:48] 91Niki: @Rudric_Ice For sure, but they are one of the easiest thing to spot as a dev using the heatmap method. Bots are programmed to repeat a pattern over and over. On a heatmap that is so easy to spot. Devs shouldn't rely on reports to get rid of bots. Which right now, with the amount of bots, seems to be the case

[3:18:25] Gargazet: wish wow was addon-free, as some addons give unfair advantages in PvP, and some are "required" in PvE. atleast they should implement some of the addons into the base game, like a version of DBM.

[3:22:23] swordart2022: @gargazet ?
[3:22:59] Ghostpuddlez: i love the ui addons, but i do feel DBM and pvp addons, and WA change the way the game is played and wish they where not in game, but its so embeded in our wow culture they would never take them away.
[3:23:16] Astillia: @swordart2022 okay thankyou ^-^
[3:23:23] Gargantix: @Gargazet two gargs :o
[3:23:23] swordart2022: @sumosoup pvp broken with some wa
[3:23:35] kashmara: be hard to suddenly take DBM away
[3:23:46] Gargazet: it's the truth though isn't it? i love addons, but it shouldn't get to that point. when i say "required to play" i meant people won't let you raid with them for example without a certian selection of addons
[3:23:55] swordart2022: @sumosoup should not see enemy abilities used cds and Dr's ever.
[3:23:56] Gargazet: @swordart2022
[3:24:11] swordart2022: @gargazet what nonsense are on about
[3:24:42] swordart2022: @gargazet I play for few years and only thing some asked for me for addons were as for notes listed
[3:24:53] dyslexican1: So I find this addon conversation silly. Look if you don;t want to play with specific addons. don't. If someone tells you you have to have them and you don;t want to... don't play withthose poele if its an issue. You have options. Everyone needs to stop making decisoons for others.
[3:25:05] dyslexican1: decisions *

[3:32:34] BoezIRL: then his shadowlands ui is not updated
[3:32:44] Jewishraver: autoupdate for elvui is why i use WOWup lol
[3:32:58] 91Niki: Either works just fine. But if you end up using Curseforge, make sure you set it to closing Overwolf when you X out of Curseforge so that shit doesn't sitck around in the background lol
[3:33:12] 91Niki: @BoezIRL Nah it isn't
