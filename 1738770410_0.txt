[1:06:29] abracka_: @Thadune valor got uncapped so theyre spamming low keys
[1:07:05] Thoreya: Big day for paladins
[1:07:37] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[1:07:42] Sanctana827: yea its a good passive
[1:07:45] ArcaneSyntax: I didn't think about it before
[1:08:54] Thadune: @abracka_ Ya I love it for my alts. Essentially anything under a 5 or 6 will attract some fat juicers. I might try and get a few more alts up for it.
[1:09:01] odriscoll1234: loooooooooooooool
[1:09:45] ArcaneSyntax: blizzard implement pally heroic leap pls
[1:09:57] Thadune: @abracka_ attracts even more when you put bonus valor in the notes.
[1:10:27] PadidinJones: Pallys got Jebaited hard with that leap
[1:10:36] Dizzen_: I think at this point, poor mobility is just a class trait of paladins
[1:10:43] Sanctana827: @Towelliee something is buggy. I cant get Strength of Conviction either. no matter where the talents go
[1:11:15] Thadune: crazy

[1:33:45] Lupusdeus: no that's new
[1:33:46] flebbooo: thats new
[1:33:47] cinamonjackz: no
[1:33:51] abracka_: no that's new
[1:33:55] Prevention6: I wish they made it like legion where divine storm just did it's full dmg at range, the current version you would still always want to be in melee range so it's kinda shit
[1:34:12] Lupusdeus: no more CS
[1:34:13] RAF_Sean: It's like Devastator for Warriors
[1:34:15] Bullety: no its like demon blades on dh
[1:34:27] warrenny: Sounds like demon bladesin havoc
[1:34:30] Zansteh: dual wield :O ?
[1:34:39] abracka_: seems like it works like demon blades for DH, or devastator. there's some talents that read with "deals x holystrike damage" wondering if "holystrike" only applies if you take that talent
[1:34:45] Lupusdeus: no not dw
[1:34:54] Molvonos: Sounds like the 2 charges would be a wasted talent, unless you can also cast Crusader Strike despite it being passive
[1:35:08] Lupusdeus: @abracka_ holystrike is just phys/holy dam
[1:35:19] Superdbot: Has the Holy tree changed at all?
[1:35:30] abracka_: @abracka_ ahh thank you, that makes sense. i was trying to figure that one out lol

[2:02:46] Zoitack: is the new paladin jump already implemented?
[2:03:09] WeedFranck: I like this Dev sentence : Kaivax notes that Seraphim has been removed from the Paladin talent tree, calling it a large factor in Paladins “having an excessive amount of buttons to press.”

[2:28:37] Prevention6: @xorag_ it's classic
[2:29:11] Senthius09: and all that gear can be turned into tier
[2:29:17] realnzall: @Towelliee Same with Sparks of Ingenuity and Infusions. Would love to be able to send those to alts
[2:29:35] raldrik: I wonder what the average ilvl of casual players. Maybe most players will be upgraded by going to 395
[2:30:01] adam6683: Did u turn it to W for wombo
[2:30:05] darkkilla1: so in about 2-3 weeks wow will be ret...arded...
[2:30:27] GamingDad77: @raldrik have done no raiding, M0, or M+...sitting at 385
[2:30:40] realnzall: @Towelliee Does the Crusader Strike talent work with the class tree talent though? I thought it was a separate damage source
[2:30:43] Hebi2Cold: @darkkilla1 lol yo i died

[2:34:55] Wugrok: if that talent works
[2:35:02] Hebi2Cold: @JakeTheBrit maybe they are trying to learn mate
[2:35:08] realnzall: @Towelliee If you swap the talents, as in not the CS AA talent but yes the AA bonus damage talent, does the damage appear as a separate entry?
[2:35:16] Mecabeast: @gamingdad77 just chugged my coffee cause lost count lol

[3:09:21] artoric: Yeah thats smart. Some pulls like Academy magic mob pulls on fort, the big pull to stairs for HOV, final stand is crucial. However I have reported to Blizzard there is a bug where I have used Final Stand and within the time it taunts enemies a DPS will get one shot.
[3:09:37] Allvarez: uncapped valor is the greatest thing for my alts, basically just building carry groups for yourself lol

[3:15:58] YinYangMan77: Yrel says otherwise
[3:15:58] Legendary_Gamerr: Or toy isle
[3:16:03] XPrevention: we for sure need the leap lol
[3:16:12] Mecabeast: the bof 30% speed buff will be nice
[3:16:14] alluza: @Towelliee  tbh paladin dosent need leap ability would be just better if they reduce charger horse cd to like 30 sec instead of 1min
[3:16:15] finalflight1: @adam6683 that horse sucks
[3:16:22] Thoreya: “Need”
[3:16:22] YinYangMan77: She's giving us that leap...
[3:16:24] adam6683: @temp3st98 That would be dope
[3:16:36] PrimalRain: everyone doesnt need great mobility
[3:16:41] Divinos572: they also didnt include the judge slow
[3:16:49] im_capy: I only have 28 points to use on the prot tree, not 30 and im on ptr too
[3:16:53] YinYangMan77: It's absolutely wonderful
[3:17:08] atsq1: Do you get holy power for that
[3:17:19] Divinos572: didnt blizz say they dont want Rets hyper mobile?
[3:17:33] dragonhunter11698: @towelliee did you know you you don't have to collect the glifeson your other characters
[3:17:34] PrimalRain: yep
[3:17:38] flochxx: brah one leap isnt going to make rets hyper mobile
[3:17:44] dragonhunter11698: glifs
[3:17:57] dragonhunter11698: okay nvm
[3:17:58] Wugrok: could always make them choose between steed and leap
[3:18:13] flochxx: steed is garbage
[3:18:15] Thoreya: seems like pal has good mobility on ptr without leap
[3:18:31] alluza: or just half the cooldown on steed
[3:18:59] Divinos572: steed and freedom are off the GCD
[3:19:03] Divinos572: so def helps
[3:19:45] artoric: yeah looking at this new prot paladin talent tree is a huge improvement. Now we have 5% on conc/10% chance to block spells not buried in tree, and the extra dmg from eye of tyr reduction of CD could mean not needing final stand as much. Also you dont feel as bad going offhealing with the new talent that heals you for 50% of the healing on another target
[3:20:21] Snabido: Party up?
[3:20:47] Mecabeast: the word of glory will be better in group content I think
[3:22:26] cinamonjackz: its amazing, makes SoV feel like a defensive!
[3:22:37] KaisenSiru: Very good
[3:22:39] jeroome___: youd never take it otherwise
[3:23:02] Kuzzo99: any type of defensive buff is an overall win. Rets were so squishy
[3:23:28] sliproach: not a pala but always power @Towelliee

[3:23:31] cinamonjackz: divine protection is baseline for ret now though
[3:23:34] Garfong: ret issues were being squishy, why would you make them think about it?
[3:23:45] Kuzzo99: pvp thats a mandatory pick, pve its still probably going to be mandatory because its connected to 3 captstones
[3:24:40] Garfong: @Kuzzo99 I think he is saying if it wasnt connected, would you take it.
[3:24:53] Kuzzo99: ahhh
[3:25:14] Kuzzo99: i'd probably still take it for mythic prog
[3:25:29] YinYangMan77: little bit
[3:25:57] YinYangMan77: Can't be finished that way...probably exploring which side to leave it on.
[3:26:04] falldrgn: Imean. extra healer in melee kinda..

[3:29:33] cinamonjackz: I think the class tree one is suppose to be the interrupt talent that grants 1HP!
[3:29:41] pigzip: Or there’s nothing to heal so it’s not calculating it
[3:30:05] Shadowmograine: it is on overhealing
[3:30:05] Killswitch6950: other pally has aggro LUL
[3:30:09] raldrik: he isnt hitting you

[3:30:26] Outerlaw: CoolStoryBob

[3:32:50] JFeezy__: thats funny but true. You could smash your face into a keyboard these days and get 25k i just dont get it lol
[3:32:52] im_capy: LUL
[3:33:12] Mecabeast: die early in lfr so you don't get reported for being afk
[3:33:15] c0mmander_starscream: Any word if Diablo 4 release is going to get delayed?
