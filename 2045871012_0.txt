[0:37:58] Lamatastisch: so does that mean unholy is dead since you play blood now? Sadge
[0:38:56] ionlyplaymetas: @Lamatastisch unholy is dead because blizz killed it with this patch lol
[0:39:30] Lamatastisch: ye the armor nerf was a bit too much for it, felt it yesterday really hard
[0:40:13] sunileif: this mean blood is no longer a tank spec?
[0:41:03] ionlyplaymetas: also have you played "murderous intent" in 3s its 9% increased dmg from you and both your teammates. Its infinitely refreshed with your attacks and with your comp it would basically always be 3 stacks
[0:41:24] josephzein: whats the best current build for unholy mes?
[0:41:24] neroxztv: ^12% with a war reflect
[0:42:12] ionlyplaymetas: @neroxztv really? it stacks another time because of the reflect? thats awesome i didnt know

[5:51:19] Catharsus: @Yanzoh YES
[5:51:22] popzirl: Fun nuggets hell yeah
[5:51:42] Catharsus: @Yanzoh but ONLY if you arrange them on the pan like the trex is chasing the stegos ;)
[5:52:00] Yanzoh: @catharsus agreed! Lol
[5:52:11] popzirl: I recently bought some honey glazed Tyson was pretty fire you close your eyes almost tastes like Chinese

[5:56:00] Itankarenas: are people still doing BDK?
[6:01:05] Frostyjoneslol: supatease released a vid on it, looks kinda wild with warrior
[6:02:35] Dudewuut: supatease was also super disingenuous with his video
[6:02:42] Dudewuut: clickbait farming
[6:02:45] Itankarenas: UH seems really squishy rn
[6:02:58] tzunamiDK: Playing much frost?
[6:03:49] Frostyjoneslol: @Dudewuut true but i mean the fact is, if bdk is doing nearly the damage of uhdk and wont really die no real use playing uhdk if u play with a partner that can carry the dam
[6:04:04] DBMezzy: I tried blood with lego, its shit asf @notmes
[6:04:14] darrenchen2000: unholy before nerfs felt so good
[6:04:14] DBMezzy: 2% dam and less vers
[6:04:39] DBMezzy: vers does give dam, no? @notmes
[6:05:19] dawsonator171: If you can line up the on use and get additional value from it, I think it is helpful. You do have empty periods as blood but I am full mastery from being frost.
[6:05:30] DBMezzy: @notmes iam too much mastery, cant test it properly, but leg now procs from all dots from dk. bbuuut, dot is nerfed a lot
[6:05:36] dawsonator171: I've seen some really good size crits.
[6:05:58] Yoskexz: sup howd ur adventure go today
[6:06:10] dawsonator171: I'm 1850 so far on blood. got a string of lobbies without leavers.
[6:06:24] DBMezzy: @notmes i wanna try bdk with that big amz, so i get a lot to spend runic shit
[6:06:46] Yoskexz: most of the bdks play with fistweave dont they
[6:06:49] dawsonator171: I don't like the fact you don't get RP from team shell, or at least I don't notice it.
[6:07:07] dawsonator171: DH so far feels like the hardest matchup.
[6:07:50] Yanzoh: @Yoskexz ya pretty much, since bdk wont die, you can fist for that extra dps rather easily
[6:08:24] DaraxBarex: hows unholy after nerf? is it really bad as they say?
[6:08:43] Yoskexz: the taunt debuff paired with monk orb debuff sounds kinda sick
[6:08:45] Yanzoh: I always feel like something went wrong with design, when you see tanks in pvp tho lol
[6:09:49] DBMezzy: rmp if not arcane rofl @notmes
[6:10:23] krome2dadome: warr seems the same way tbh
[6:10:45] gracioussatan: what's the weakness with blood dk comps? ignore the dk?
[6:10:51] Yoskexz: are hunters in the same boat. we can go fishing together peepoShy
[6:10:57] DaraxBarex: i see. but for an average player, ig udk is still ok to reach 2.4k?
[6:11:03] Frostyjoneslol: can we all agree fears acting as stuns is just ridiculous
[6:11:07] gracioussatan: gotchaa
[6:11:10] krome2dadome: I’d fish with u any day yoske
[6:11:29] Yoskexz: @krome2dadome  bigWOW
[6:11:31] DaraxBarex: makes sense yeah. thanks!
[6:12:13] mouro52: Is blood the best spec now or whats going on?
[6:12:14] mouro52: for shuffle
[6:12:16] Yoskexz: lowkey wanna watch mes play palworld inbetween shuffle q LULW
[6:12:45] krome2dadome: u a palworld gamer? @notmes
[6:15:09] krome2dadome: would u dot build with it?

[6:21:55] Dudewuut: @Tdales does not give damage amp anymore, irrelevant
[6:22:16] Tdales: Good to know thanks
[6:24:25] Treemanm: is it possible to install mes's whole ui and setup easily, its so perfct
[6:25:20] samueltko: this is so cringe
[6:25:25] samueltko: why are you playing liike this

[6:26:20] Axtin: honestly being blood just gave them more of a chance to win, no way they could win as unholy
[6:26:36] Yanzoh: wow
[6:26:37] darrenchen2000: mes is dh better than dk rn
[6:26:46] darrenchen2000: could dh be good in tournament
[6:27:22] Disemble: 100k dps single target ur just fine the whole time xD
[6:27:25] Yoskexz: @Axtin  monkaHmm
[6:27:36] crusadein: @darrenchen2000 yes

[6:28:49] Freebolt: seems kinda meh yeah
[6:28:58] Freebolt: we beat them as splay quite easily
[6:29:09] Freebolt: just long and drawnout
[6:29:16] Tdales: @Dudewuut what about shackling dark transform? Im assuming thats huge damage loss
[6:29:28] Warshal: is the healer cc'd wa available?
[6:29:35] Dudewuut: irrelevant, pet/minion dam was trubo nerfed
[6:30:01] Dudewuut: unholy dam is rotational not, not pet/minion cooldown based
[6:30:07] Dudewuut: rotational now*

[6:30:48] Dudewuut: dark trans is a glorified kick now lolol
[6:30:49] Tdales: @Dudewuut thanks!
[6:31:00] Freebolt: what would you like to see changed with frost dk? curious to see your opinion. it seems very annoying to play and play into
[6:31:07] crusadein: @Tdales its not bad, you can stop the pet kick and stun but meh
[6:31:25] Dudewuut: yeah but not really worth taking a talent to stop
[6:31:59] Dudewuut: if you are losing to a petkick/stun you made other more ergegious mistakes
[6:33:10] Tdales: @Dudewuut When going into Dark Transform how does pet kick get enhanced?
[6:33:35] Dudewuut: 5-325ish yard range on the kick
[6:33:40] Dudewuut: 5-25*
[6:33:51] Dudewuut: and it will root
[6:33:56] Tdales: ohh i see
[6:34:13] Dudewuut: if it just a non dt kick it just jumps to you
[6:34:17] Dudewuut: no kick
[6:35:13] Tdales: so pet can only interupt in dark trasnform?
[6:35:26] Dudewuut: cprrect
[6:36:08] Tdales: since when. a couple xpac ago i sweat they could kick with regular pet
[6:36:36] Tdales: swear*
[6:37:29] Dudewuut: pretty sure for many expansions now
[6:38:08] TheKemical: ggs mes
[6:38:10] Dudewuut: the stun is a 1 second pet stun outside of dt and a 2secish stun inside dt that could be what was inturrupting you
[6:38:37] Tdales: true thats prob what it was
[6:38:53] Tdales: thanks for the help

[8:28:27] stackerproductions: nah dude i always root for u in awc whether you play or not
[8:28:43] wyldeshock: the subathon did make someone a little rude but it’s ok
[8:28:47] stackerproductions: i played with awc guys and some of these top guys are actually rude
[8:29:03] gnatking: why is 1800mmr cancer for fdk
[8:29:08] gnatking: good lord
[8:30:01] Yanzoh: because blizzard doesnt care to rework fdk :(
[8:30:46] Neriakied: wow is baby playground compared to league toxicity
[8:30:50] avenueone: lol is that even a real question
[8:30:55] Neriakied: especially at the top
[8:31:05] avenueone: isnt league renowned for its toxicity
[8:31:06] gnatking: never played league but played smite. that was insane toxicity
[8:31:06] wyldeshock: wow is probably more toxic but I see it more frequently in league
[8:31:33] wyldeshock: so many elitists in wow. keys, arenas, rbgs, even raiding
[8:31:46] dimitridq: solo is a different breed
[8:31:51] gnatking: I think blitz will fail if goes rated. thought the same about shuffle but blitz is different.
[8:31:54] dimitridq: wow anarchy
[8:32:03] Evershade: Even classic and SoD is toxic as hell
[8:32:11] Yoskexz: thats like the main reason i dont like qn it, wait 30 min for a pool of toxicity lol
[8:32:19] stackerproductions: oh yea
[8:32:32] stackerproductions: people would make characters on your battlegroup just to take u out
[8:32:35] gnatking: cata was mw2 lobbies after school for us 90s kids lol
[8:32:39] stackerproductions: and it felt like life or death
[8:32:47] wyldeshock: it’s really hard to not get upset when someone is playing like garbage.
[8:32:59] Neriakied: league has had 15 years of solo q to rot peoples brains down
[8:32:59] dimitridq: lmao
[8:33:12] gottacatsupemall: internet was wild in the 2000s
[8:33:30] dimitridq: i think wow players forget how complex the game is and that by those standards 99% of players are playing like "garbage"
[8:33:43] dimitridq: you just have to do what you can
[8:33:58] Yanzoh: i dont mind new players that dont know, there is a hell of a learning curb for pvp, but if i queue with someone who is 2k + and they play like a new player i get pissed
[8:34:18] wyldeshock: getting upset is like drinking poison hoping the other person gets sick
[8:34:25] Neriakied: its a legit skill making people not rage in solo q games so u have a higher chance of winning
[8:34:40] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: I think people are too quick to criticise other people’s mistakes - chances are you’re not playing perfectly either
[8:35:19] dimitridq: solo is 6 rounds for a reason
[8:35:44] honsou2: solo queue is just silly in lol and wow both. they are team games
[8:38:56] honsou2: @dimitridq imo the 6 rounds make it more toxic than if it was just regular queueing solo
[8:39:05] Axesmittayyy: if I ever play with mes I just do the complete opposite of what he says just incase lol jk jk
[8:39:08] wyldeshock: fellas i do not play mage but imma gear one. should i just play fire or arcane?
[8:39:18] wyldeshock: arcane looks more fun
[8:39:35] wyldeshock: @axesmittayyy toxic
[8:39:46] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: arcane is more fun but that’s because I hate combustion
[8:40:13] RinzlerXII: whats the new secret tech after the changes?
[8:40:17] honsou2: i would probably start with fire if it was me, arcane doesent do the most damage so its not very forgiving
[8:40:35] dimitridq: @honsou2 6 rounds gives people a chance to learn from their mistakes, if it wasnt no way half the player base would be able to climb
[8:41:22] honsou2: @dimitridq you never play the same comp twice anyway, so what are you learning that you dont learn in regular queues one game at a time
[8:41:33] wyldeshock: probably just need to learn how to do damage control during combust and kite outside of it aye?
[8:42:18] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: pretty much and when you get the mythical lobby where you’re left alone you just go ham with flame cannon
[8:43:04] ahmopasha: Hi all
[8:46:31] DrWarz: sick autodmg
[8:46:31] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[8:46:45] honsou2: damn that cocoon got smoked
[8:46:47] dimitridq: @honsou2 how to focus and adjust to the comps you are playing and how the players you are playing play
[8:46:53] dimitridq: cant do that in any other game mode
[8:47:07] dimitridq: mes that ad scared the shit out of me lol
[8:47:16] dimitridq: youre lucky we lived
[8:47:20] honsou2: @dimitridq yes you can thats what you do in normal arena too
[8:47:44] bxrgle: @notmes what build do you like to play
[8:47:54] dimitridq: @honsou2 not back to back like in solo though
[8:48:46] honsou2: well youre not adjusting to the comps back to back in shuffle because the comps change just like in regular queueing session
[8:48:57] dimitridq: not the same consistency that allows for improvement of strategy in real time
[8:49:56] dimitridq: if you fuck up twice and then focus up you can still get a win if you sweep, in arena if you fuck around you just straight lose
[8:49:57] honsou2: disagree, allows for less improvement because improvement of strategy isnt a reactionary decision which is all you have time for when youre playing at an mmr thats stressful IE a place where you need to improve
[8:50:02] alltimer1986: @notmes hey what’s up !
[8:50:46] alltimer1986: @notmes are you allowed to play tank in AWC ?
[8:51:14] dimitridq: i highly disagree that you have to play entirely reactionary in solo, and if you are, you are probably losing if youre not putting thought into it
[8:51:32] alltimer1986: recraft everything to haste will get you there probably
[8:51:55] wyldeshock: @alltimer1986 last ssn a team played arms brewmaster fistweaver
[8:51:57] dimitridq: example being the pres dk team switched up their strat but it took 3 games they had to q in order to do it, when they wouldve adjusted much faster in a solo
[8:52:05] mule0_0: why u speed is 17% any item enchat?
[8:52:12] mule0_0: enhance
[8:53:48] Mortifiedwow: I quit playing retail cause gather profs don't make any gold and I couldn't craft gear for all my alts but watching retail streams makes me wanna play so bad D:
[8:54:39] DBMezzy: @Mortifiedwow u cant craft 4-5k items? thats why u stop?
[8:54:40] DBMezzy: nice
[8:55:18] akadhtwq: enchants and crafted is way more than 4-5k gold
[8:55:32] Mortifiedwow: I mean when it's 4-5k for every item and I had 5-6 chars plus gems and enchants
[8:56:23] melbu2423: you can make 4k just vendoring trash after farming something for an hour.
[8:56:25] Mortifiedwow: But yea. I would rather just play wrath pve and sod than waste 6 hrs farming ore for 6k
[8:56:28] DBMezzy: @Mortifiedwow u cant make 20k gold in month and u stop?
[8:56:39] DBMezzy: man u talk shit
[8:56:53] Mortifiedwow: Huh
[8:56:58] DBMezzy: stop cause cant afford craft items, most bullshit
[8:57:12] melbu2423: some worlds quests ven give you 900g
[8:57:28] DBMezzy: u can make gold in an 1-2 hours for all ur gear and u telling shit to chat
[8:57:54] stockbridge10: gl
[8:57:58] melbu2423: you dont have to be that mean @DBMezzy but yeah, making gold is so easy right now
[8:58:15] DBMezzy: @melbu2423 u dont have to lie to chat for no reason
[8:58:23] DBMezzy: and misslead people
[8:58:35] Mortifiedwow: O.o
[8:58:38] Mortifiedwow: Lmao
[8:58:42] dimitridq: yeah ofc
[8:58:44] dimitridq: go ahead
[8:58:51] honsou2: high vers not the play?
[8:59:02] dimitridq: I think he just doesnt like that style of gold farming bud
[8:59:03] Freddiefletch: do you feel like paper against physical now?

[9:04:32] wyldeshock: dk is a cool class tho
[9:04:44] wyldeshock: I’m glad I picked it back up this ssn
[9:05:07] alltimer1986: wait you can just recraft the items to other status ?
[9:05:23] dimitridq: sad we dont see the holy mesidan much anymore
[9:05:29] kursiidd: I'd like a dk alt tbh just make em the dk version of my palidan
[9:05:30] melbu2423: @alltimer1986 yes
[9:05:53] melbu2423: you can recraft evrytthing to somethingf new on it if you want

[9:08:13] melbu2423: just add an updated spark to it
[9:08:32] melbu2423: ingenuity .> shadowflame > dream spark
[9:10:00] thunderstud25: we experimenting something new? or just optimizing?
[9:10:27] dimitridq: ty mes for the games, gotta hit the hay
[9:11:22] nikthevoker: what spec did you like more
[9:13:45] thunderstud25: that’s interesting
[9:14:08] abne41c: Haste the new meta?
[9:15:18] stoneagecs: hey mes
[9:15:22] stoneagecs: stone here
[9:15:37] stoneagecs: if you'd like to test your haste build with shammy
[9:16:00] Solushun: some pumpers signed up haha
[9:16:12] wyldeshock: what is your favorite healing spec to play with in 2s oh UH
[9:16:30] stoneagecs: kk sounds good
[9:17:09] Solushun: LOL thats great i never seen that before
[9:17:16] Solushun: only the front page signs up LOL
[9:17:19] thunderstud25: haha prob not pushing much higher in 2s for now, the damp games are ehhhh lol I played a bit more after we stopped and just basically still at 2150 , it’s all damp games
[9:17:38] thunderstud25: so ima start finally leaning into 3s a bit I think
[9:17:49] Snikz_tv: !drops

[9:18:01] Devcomz: 3s feel real damp too though
[9:18:08] Devcomz: all my games are 5 min or longer
[9:18:12] nikthevoker: i liked Unh/hpal/dev was nice
[9:18:37] Devcomz: My comps are Rogue/lock healer and TSG
[9:18:43] Devcomz: in 3s
[9:18:50] Solushun: Rogue Lock Hpal is good
[9:18:51] thunderstud25: I think there are some mixed comps that work well , but I agree the wizard comps feel best so far
[9:19:02] Solushun: thats been good even when hpal was poop
[9:19:10] petkicklol: 31% haste sounds like the most fun
[9:19:15] nikthevoker: thats what i played with my ukraine friends during the day no comms, and farmed majority of teams
[9:19:44] thunderstud25: was playing a little boomy demo hpal which was interesting

[9:20:27] petkicklol: swear clawing with high haste does work
[9:20:30] Devcomz: I dont like the new changes
[9:21:44] thunderstud25: it’s a different kind of dampening games as hpal in 2s rather than 3s I find. in 2s hpal will just get trained to prevent mana efficiency, 3s with the extra peels it’s almost not worth focusing hpal
[9:21:57] gelatokush: the lego scale wit hhaste too now
[9:22:00] gelatokush: and dots
[9:22:11] thunderstud25: especially in a caster cleave matchup where you are back lining
[9:22:36] abne41c: @petkicklol have you tried it bud?
[9:22:58] Szain3: :D
[9:23:49] petkicklol: na I’m in the process of trying no 4 piece rn
[9:24:05] petkicklol: seemed good
[9:24:41] abne41c: Ok tyy
[9:24:52] gelatokush: dk still owns dragons :D
[9:25:39] nikthevoker: crit mast tho
[9:25:45] plebcake_: noob question: does haste increase the rate of your diseases??
[9:27:09] petkicklol: magus does scale insanely well with haste ya
[9:27:09] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[9:27:16] petkicklol: @plebcake_ no it doesn’t
[9:28:07] petkicklol: commander with high haste may be the play
[9:28:12] plebcake_: so then what’s the argument for haste > mastery, faster globals for ramp up? @petkicklol
[9:28:27] yourKnightmaare: @petkicklol need some more streams brother man 😁
[9:28:34] petkicklol: just way smoother more fun too
[9:28:53] petkicklol: magus would be ur top dam
[9:28:56] petkicklol: with high haste
[9:29:04] petkicklol: @yourknightmaare eventually…
[9:29:35] yourKnightmaare: Always entertaining my dude @petkicklol
[9:29:45] petkicklol: =)
[9:30:07] Sunehx: haste vers better than mastery/vers or vers/mastery?
[9:30:10] yourKnightmaare: @petkicklol what haste you recommend with commander?
[9:30:13] eenton: petkick has always the best music
[9:30:40] petkicklol: prob would want 30%
[9:30:52] petkicklol: @eenton =)
[9:30:55] wyldeshock: sounds like heavy mastery isn’t the play
[9:31:30] gelatokush: alot of spec are like this like dh all top pvper run full mastery no haste, no crit and its very good, same with dev, same with bm alot of spec atm in pvp in meta build is just full mastery but i feel its not always the way
[9:32:42] gelatokush: ret is a good example to in pvp alot go most mastery in pve mastery is the least desired spec
[9:32:46] gelatokush: stat
[9:33:15] plebcake_: a full haste pet build could be something I try out
[9:33:24] plebcake_: I agree that full mastery feels really clunky
[9:35:35] abne41c: It actually feels like you have 500ms
[9:35:40] yourKnightmaare: I still think raise abom should have been baseline in PVP scenarios over aotd
[9:36:47] yourKnightmaare: Should have a pvp version of details. Because the cleave and stuff sounds pve af
[9:38:36] yourKnightmaare: Do you think it would be smart to auto change aotd to raise abom in PVP, mes?
[9:38:43] yourKnightmaare: Like a good change
[9:38:56] petkicklol: would be a net buff ya
[9:39:03] petkicklol: more magus due to shorter cd
[9:39:46] petkicklol: I was trying a 90% mastery build I didn’t rly notice that big of a numbers
[9:40:10] yourKnightmaare: I just hate aotd in PVP
[9:41:33] petkicklol: I was playing like 35 Vers/66 mastery in those games last night
[9:41:37] petkicklol: 20% haste too
[9:43:35] petkicklol: yea that’s odd has to be festermight
[9:43:35] nasxsy: do u use threat plates?

[9:45:06] petkicklol: @abne41c Magus dam would be disgusting
[9:45:16] gelatokush: we have enough pet build in the game ill pass
[9:45:27] petkicklol: but it’s hard to get UA & commander
[9:45:46] abne41c: True ye
[9:46:13] petkicklol: & at that point is it rly worth to drop superstrain
[9:46:55] wyldeshock: ngl pres does not feel good in 2s. maybe if you can spam a lot of dam

[9:47:27] Roseqt: gg
[9:48:41] petkicklol: aotd ghouls do the most
[9:48:45] petkicklol: with commander
[9:50:34] abne41c: Would bargain be bad in a pet build? Because you dont summon as many magus? But you summon them faster with the tier
[9:51:10] petkicklol: you summon the same amount of magus just no ghouls during apoc
[9:51:29] abne41c: Ahh ok ty
[9:51:42] petkicklol: have to give up an honor talent for it so idk & like I said apoc ghouls do THE most with commander
[9:51:54] petkicklol: but idk would have to test both
[9:52:12] abne41c: Too many things to try out
[9:52:31] petkicklol: yea but that’s the fun of it imo
[9:53:29] abne41c: Yes the game feels les restrictive

[11:14:06] plebcake_: i've been afk - are you chanigng your gear to haste? or what testing now
[11:14:45] bornbetter: why don't you just sim it?
[11:15:25] waitimdesyncd: sadly no
[11:15:33] nargonisttv: Ih aven't heard of one
[11:15:41] bornbetter: hmm I guess the nerfs are a good point, but I generally use Add Cleave or Heavy Movement sims
[11:15:54] plebcake_: what % of UH damage is shadow vs physical/magic?
[11:16:25] bornbetter: Yeah that's a good point
[11:16:27] plebcake_: not sure how to calculate that via my details
[11:16:28] Blaze150000: 195%>180%
[11:17:10] bornbetter: damn I wish raidbots adjusted for pvp buffs now
[11:17:34] Toiarc: New youtube videos, when?
[11:17:42] bornbetter: Usually I just baseline the talents that I generally know that I want, and run from there
[11:17:57] bornbetter: I need to check drustvar now for the active nerfs/buffs
[11:17:58] bornbetter: ugh
[11:18:37] waitimdesyncd: @bornbetter  its rather useless. even your big army cds ruin the sim so much the data becomes useless for pvp
[11:19:54] plebcake_: have you tried full haste pet build with 4 set? @notmes
[11:19:56] waitimdesyncd: cap

[11:20:18] waitimdesyncd: and youre very wise and a authority in your classes
[11:21:17] waitimdesyncd: A wow creator doesnt have to be right 100% of the time. You need to be in the know and share the info with us, and you def know things

[11:26:56] waitimdesyncd: @SoraSkyforge  He grew up in not the best of homies and has likely taken a bit of damage from it. If you jump down that rabbithole you might come to find, that its very serious and its proof kids need a good familiy to become compatible with the world

[11:39:45] opnr: hi, i just resubbed to wow after some time and im having trouble deciding what class to play, any suggestions? i enjoy mainly pvp content but wouldnt mind some pve content also. whatever help/advice is appreciated (:
[11:40:00] Chillinar: play hunter. no bias here ofc

[11:41:52] Triangulum: mornin
[11:41:58] Chillinar: howdy
[11:42:00] Begasaur: not to bad, sore but could be worse
[11:42:06] opnr: @Chillinar i used to use this website as a kid alllll the time, right now i have a bone raptor but i cant get over the spirit beasts. loque'nahak is my favourite looking pet by faaar
[11:42:15] Begasaur: its oozing alot but its better
[11:42:43] Begasaur: so today is my day to gear my shaman for phase 2 in sod
[11:42:56] Chillinar: @opnr it took me 5 days to get that spirit beast lol. back then when sever hop addon was a thing. good old time
[11:43:12] Chillinar: since that day I haven't seen it anymore
[11:43:31] opnr: @Chillinar dude the first time i got that pet i was like 8 and my dad asked me to go on a mining route while he went to work and along that route i found it and caught and surprised my dad loool
[11:43:48] Chillinar: LOL
[11:44:07] opnr: thinking back to it my dad had a kid to min max his wow gold production...
[11:44:08] Chillinar: that's good childhood memory!
[11:44:09] opnr: what a goat.
[11:44:23] Chillinar: lol same I was the farm bot of my dad lmao
[11:44:26] Chillinar: herbs, mining, pvp
[11:44:28] Chillinar: everything
[11:44:28] Chillinar: xd
[11:44:41] artsskeit: so what youre saying is no one should bot but just have some kids
[11:44:47] opnr: yes
[11:44:47] Chillinar: I got him all the consumes for this raid days lol
[11:44:51] artsskeit: probably at least 4 to rotate
[11:45:02] Chillinar: that's the only reason to have kids wdym
[11:45:06] artsskeit: sounds like rosie needs some siblings
[11:45:07] judgerages: kids are tos bots
[11:45:15] opnr: TOS BOTS LOOOL
[11:45:16] Chillinar: that's how I got my monthly payment from my parents lol
[11:45:32] Chillinar: was only 5€ but man I was proud of that
[11:45:51] opnr: hey thats 5€ u didnt have before :p
[11:45:54] petetoe: LIZUN
[11:46:00] Chillinar: exactly!
[11:46:34] opnr: mes makes dk look like a lot of fun, maybe i main that class
[11:46:39] plebcake_: @notmes how would you rework Frost? what kind of archetype?
[11:46:49] opnr: ive also watched a few partywafflesx videos n he puuumps
[11:48:29] plebcake_: @opnr most classes can pump, just depends on how you want to play
[11:49:08] opnr: @plebcake_ i love a big bursty class that can one shot :p
[11:49:20] opnr: i also dont miiind bleeds and ramp up dmg but id prefer burst
[11:49:33] aant02: holy shit they are rotting
[11:50:49] plebcake_: @opnr UH has ramp and rot. Frost can be very bursty. If you're playing hunter I'd suggest MM - one of the best bursts in game atm
[11:51:01] opnr: @plebcake_ i also like only play melee, im really bad at spell casters
[11:51:14] opnr: @plebcake_ maybe its time i learn frost mage
[11:51:16] wyldeshock: I’m going to have every class geared this season. and socketed. im kind of a freak

[11:53:34] madFinall: yeah thats great
[11:53:38] opnr: how does windwalker feel this xpac? they seem pretty cool
[11:53:41] wyldeshock: it’s fun. I think I’ve learned the game better by playing more classes
[11:53:59] wowsuomi: Alot of toons like mes druid
[11:54:07] opnr: yaaa leg sweep is kinda iffy
[11:54:28] ZealotryTV: gearing for alts shouldnt be a thing. i should just be able to login in play. i dont wanna do the grind more than once
[11:54:49] wyldeshock: would you be interested in playing some enh after awc? always thought it would be fun to watch
[11:55:13] artsskeit: that priest just kicked a puppy
