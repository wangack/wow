[0:59:00] emergence_fi: as a rule of thumb every ele is a bot Kappa
[1:02:07] anamamanaya: he just knocked and kicked cyclone same time
[1:02:10] atrasia94: did you lazic your eyes yet
[1:02:11] atomic_gossipgirlxo: If your eles DPS isn't >120k, he's prob not a bot lol
[1:02:32] zaigodmodex: If u dont kick u cant miss 5head
[1:02:32] saglorn: why is ele so prone to botting?
[1:02:40] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Super easy class to bot
[1:02:45] anamamanaya: it felt like he knocked himself and kicked  unconsciously
[1:03:28] rtm1994x: use this defensive @ this %, this at another, damage rotation pretty easy, grounding/tremor on use of certain spells, just all quite scripted responses making it easy to bot

[1:06:06] veq45: every semi decent ele is considered a bot now by the clowns
[1:06:20] The_Fz: nah this was a jok
[1:06:37] The_Fz: it's not high rating... there's a difference between someone good and a kick bot
[1:06:56] The_Fz: i was trying to insta fake like 0.2 of a cast and still getting kicked was blatant lmao
[1:08:28] imnotagodx: ???? KEKW

[1:15:08] tom5524: tom5524 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:15:19] Sloeex: Devo is good rn
[1:15:20] taylors09: prob is it counts as getting hit by 3x death as well and you are kinda killing yourself when you press death on cd
[1:15:20] Twinklefairyx: Shadowpriest is just as bad as feral
[1:15:22] Sloeex: please nerf it
[1:15:24] oWcsgo: Do you think we will see some class tunings/changes before the new patch on wednesday? Like Spriest buff in pvp etc
[1:15:27] Sloeex: class is not healthy when good
[1:15:35] Sloeex: and i say this as a devo main
[1:15:57] tom5524: Do you remember taking a Dump on a frost mage called Tom a few days ago in RBGs Arathi Basin XD
[1:15:58] Babbesmisk: toughts on assa rog?
[1:16:12] Sloeex: devo was good for a week in df s1
[1:16:16] Sloeex: then it got instant nerfed
[1:16:24] Sloeex: that was the time when deep breath did insane dmg
[1:16:24] FoxiekittenWoW: fun fact, there is more shadow priest in rank 1 range than both holy and disc priest combined.
[1:16:25] Echo_Esports: It’s Christmas time! New World First mousepad is now available!! Buy it now and get 15% off all other merch at: echogg.ly/merch/Raiku
[1:16:26] ezro_91: @Raikubest hey why are you not streaming while 3v3 with whazz
[1:16:46] Stepbrogue: @ezro_91 He answered earlier, Whazz gets all the viewers so it's basically not worth his time to stream
[1:16:54] archtme: as a healer it doesnt feel like spriest does good damage this ssn whereas feral and devoker can do sick damage so at least they have that
[1:17:00] tom5524: Bro I was freaking out how you did that much dmg, was sure you had some high exp but i didnt know it was YOU!
[1:17:05] ezro_91: hmm i would love to watch raiku xD
[1:17:18] tom5524: Yeah Kultiran all the way
[1:17:19] ezro_91: @Stepbrogue thx for the answer
[1:17:31] holyskyler: If you can stream 3s like lontar that would be great
[1:17:33] taylors09: @FoxiekittenWoW there is not a single sp what bracket you talking about?
[1:18:08] guilexs: Bru is all about making money bro , just stream it and make more money
[1:18:08] FoxiekittenWoW: @taylors09 3s, im looking at both eu and na.
[1:18:31] holyskyler: you get less viewers because whaaz is streaming every day. stream every day high rated. 3s and you will go to 1k viewers
[1:18:37] Nextrkw: hello
[1:18:52] pazta9: I like hearing that tho
[1:18:52] taylors09: na is troll anyways
[1:18:57] suterama: are u gonna play 3s with akrololz?
[1:19:00] pazta9: Helps me also improve
[1:19:04] FoxiekittenWoW: @taylors09 4 shadow priest and 3 healer priest is in rank 1 range currently both regions combined.
[1:19:11] PanakoGG: y I kinda like the tryhard vibe with wazz'
[1:19:12] Chocapic88: Exactly, we can hear your sexy voice
[1:19:19] PanakoGG: but ofc then ur not shillin
[1:19:37] archtme: you NEED to stream sometimes when whaazz does, I wanna watch you guys without listening to danish rap, it's a crime against humanity
[1:19:39] Feroxita1337: whaazz always says you just dont feel comfortable streaming 3s... i always assumed it was because he shit talks you so much :D
[1:20:01] taylors09: @FoxiekittenWoW not combined, only in NA
[1:20:03] Elozern: @archtme u know what's even worse...german rap
[1:20:13] Nab1337: they can still hear strats on whaaz stream
[1:20:14] slickdaddyg69: tryhard or not raiku is the best <3
[1:20:46] taylors09: @FoxiekittenWoW and that says more about NA ladder than anything else kekw
[1:20:53] slickdaddyg69: i watch raiku cuz hes the best <3
[1:21:10] Axtin: theres probably some people that enjoy the tryhard content but not the majority
[1:21:15] swapAllDay: Raiku comedian? Umm Tell a joke Kappa
[1:21:17] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[1:21:17] tom5524: Just need a ton of alts to chill on
[1:21:20] kand1nsky: The streamer is the zoo animal Kappa
[1:21:20] FoxiekittenWoW: @taylors09 there is 1 healer priest in eu and 2 in na who is in rank 1 range and 4 shadow priest in na, so combined there is more shadow priest
[1:21:28] Nateypww: is mastery icicle build good?
[1:21:29] Izostarx: Im not here to be entertained. I wanna see how the best play the game.
[1:21:32] OnkelKokos: True. Make a podcast if ppl want to complain xD
[1:21:37] Feroxita1337: ah it depends... i personally watch the most r1 players because of the high lvl gameplay but maybe im in the minority
[1:21:57] slickdaddyg69: im here for the same reason people go to the zoo
[1:21:59] Nab1337: But if you look at it as a sport, its like watching Cristiano Ronaldo play and communicate with his team etc. which would be gold
[1:22:31] holyskyler: so tonight you will stream 3v3
[1:22:46] FoxiekittenWoW: But you are the one who never wants to try out stuff on stream? you also want to play the best comb with your best geared chars?
[1:23:06] Feroxita1337: ye i noticed that aswell it seems like he always wants to be right
[1:23:08] Izostarx: Yeah, thats true.
[1:23:14] Ceribi: havent seen a boomy ina while holy shit
[1:23:15] tastyyyyy: having god complex playing wow is WILD
[1:23:20] tom5524: Hes gotta look good to keep up that image i get that
[1:23:26] taylors09: @FoxiekittenWoW i get what u say, 2 out of those 4 na sps is the same guy btw. All 3 priest specs are useless
[1:23:52] Hogstabber: i watch raiku, xaryu, aeghis and ziqo because i wish i could play a mage like they do
[1:23:53] FoxiekittenWoW: @taylors09 yea priest is not the best atm, its was also just a "fun" fact :D
[1:23:58] tony1992qt: dont play with him on while streaming :P
[1:24:04] tom5524: Built up a viewership from being the "best" does make it challenging
[1:24:10] slickdaddyg69: i just look at raikus numbers and think to myself daym this guy is insane
[1:24:21] Izostarx: Izostarx subscribed with Prime. 
[1:25:08] PanakoGG: bro i aint go lie when I watch retail game feels creazy

[1:41:42] revoloI: u just dont want it that bad then Kappa
[1:42:35] MarthozTv: how long would u guess it would take for someone that plays wrath arena to learn retail arena?
[1:42:54] Joke_Fistweaver: what add-on is that?
[1:42:57] Joke_Fistweaver: for stat penalty
[1:43:04] icepresso: do you go for mastery?
[1:43:20] oldschoolxlove: True stat what
[1:43:29] taylors09: values
[1:43:53] DirtyYankee0: I didnt know bloodlust didnt count
[1:43:54] DirtyYankee0: wtf
[1:44:00] Stepbrogue: A % is a %
[1:44:03] DirtyYankee0: very interesting
[1:45:19] DirtyYankee0: kinda makes human racial meh
[1:45:45] Joke_Fistweaver: am I the only one who finds these stat penalties confusing?
[1:45:47] atrasia94: why they dont make human racial 30sec cd with trinket :(
[1:45:54] Joke_Fistweaver: esp when they're not shown in default ui
[1:46:29] stacyer: @randomafk that's blizzard. So many things not shown in UI, like how spells scale in PvP etc
[1:46:31] man0litos: @Raikubest SO i guess you get enough haste versa until so you dont get to 20% cuttoff
[1:46:31] DirtyYankee0: yeah default ui is trash
[1:46:33] Echo_Esports: It’s Christmas time! New World First mousepad is now available!! Buy it now and get 15% off all other merch at: echogg.ly/merch/Raiku

[1:47:30] inviEuw: i needed one win aswell
[1:47:35] tom5524: You play about much with the Frost spec? Ive gone all mastery no tier set on mine. Think it does more consistent dmg/pressure than glacial build
[1:47:39] Mikoqttv: heya
[1:47:40] Joke_Fistweaver: is 10% penalty worth it?
[1:48:09] imnotagodx: mmr cap? Sadge
[1:48:12] taylors09: yeah it all stopped
[1:48:17] Holyxyz1: ye cutoff stopped moving too kinda
[1:48:19] taylors09: i think they just forgot tbh :D
[1:48:41] tom5524: we need it to be over 9000
[1:48:42] sistahfistah1: hard to play high mmr with all the ddosing :)
[1:49:02] Holyxyz1: you perma face the same people atm too on higher mmr
[1:49:05] Holyxyz1: is boring ye
[1:49:23] foxyllama: SOD IS THE FUTURE
[1:49:27] DoctorDaggers: @PanakoGG dust

[1:49:31] Zenlyn: graftah
[1:49:34] imnotagodx: @foxyllama OMEGALUL BFD is the future ofc
[1:49:37] littlefot: if i start retail now again can I gear up fast again, i got a lbl 70 char
[1:49:39] FoxiekittenWoW: @Holyxyz1 i feel like the 3s cutoff is growing quite fast or?
[1:49:40] DirtyYankee0: sod is sleeper
[1:49:49] Holyxyz1: @FoxiekittenWoW nah KEKW
[1:49:51] inviEuw: giftah´s all purpose

[1:49:54] DoctorDaggers: Griftah's All-Purpose Embellishing Powder.
[1:49:55] Holyxyz1: its 20 points in over a week
[1:49:57] tom5524: Need no rating loss just gains, if people leave they should still get smashed with - rating
[1:49:59] Holyxyz1: thats super slow
[1:50:07] Zenlyn: omg real @foxyllama
[1:50:14] foxyllama: TY @Zenlyn
[1:50:19] lmaoerss: sod was fun for a few weeks, people milk it too hard
[1:50:25] FoxiekittenWoW: @Holyxyz1 yea but i mean the number of spots, i think 1 week ago there was 50 now there is over 70 spots
[1:50:25] eacherro: @foxyllama With the difficulty where you can beat "raid" with 0 blue gear... it might be "future" for people that are not cutting it on retail
[1:50:27] Holyxyz1: talking about the cutoff in 3s atm
[1:50:29] Joke_Fistweaver: it's defo stopped
[1:50:35] tom5524: and bump up the rating requirement for glad rk1 ect..
[1:50:44] Joke_Fistweaver: it's also harder for healers to climb because low healers got the initial mmr boost and now you only get matched with them
[1:50:48] Joke_Fistweaver: making it harder to climb
[1:51:03] FoxiekittenWoW: @Holyxyz1 thats almost a 50% increase in a very short period of time
[1:51:08] imnotagodx: @eacherro green, blue, purple or orange is just a color :^) but yeah its stupidly ez
[1:51:35] lmaoerss: think we'll see some class tuning this week?
[1:51:40] Holyxyz1: ye but it doesnt mean anything anyways atm

[2:54:40] IWCarry: @dogsenses people dont just lift to beat other people up its fun
[2:54:41] HRZNx: building a physique is about working hard on something, setting goals and accomplishing something to be proud of
[2:54:47] garlicmanx: If the point is self protection otherwise it's just ego
[2:54:51] Synckery: chat is funny today need to get some popcorn

[2:56:21] Synckery: @dogsenses think its a bit disingenuous to say that you can only have one or the other
[2:56:27] DirtyYankee0: for real
[2:56:32] realdreadx: all those muscles just to get shot by a 45 glock
[2:56:40] dogsenses: well u have 24 hrs in a day i rather  not spend half my life in the gym
[2:56:44] garlicmanx: It's why you don't see UFC champions going for pure mass
[2:56:52] dogsenses: normal life makes you healthy enough if u go out or walks and stuff
[2:56:56] DirtyYankee0: you are in a european stream talking about guns most places guns are irrelevant @dreadworldx

[3:02:14] Reeceboss: it was so painful
[3:02:15] IWCarry: guys why you work out, you cant beat people up anywaxs there are laws and the police 😭

[3:02:32] dogsenses: i mean if you enjoy lifting weights and being huge then OK sure but you cant look down on those who dont want to spend half their life eating and beign at the gym
[3:02:38] Akurax: @IWCarry working out is for beating people? daquf
[3:02:48] dogsenses: an apple a day you die anyway, being huge just means your grave will be bigger

[3:03:12] realdreadx: LUL
[3:03:23] diskmachin1: your right i should just shot myself since its pointless to do anything anyway
[3:03:23] Deathmarkedx: @dogsenses being healthy is more than "not being sick" bro
[3:03:31] Reeceboss: working out is entirely essential for a mans mental health, knowing ur the weakest in the room is something that should not live comfortably, do you know how much confidence i gain knowing i can benchpress the enemy if necessary
[3:03:34] IWCarry: @akurax just repeating newly learned facts
[3:03:39] doublerightt: your all on autohotkey -raiku 2024
[3:03:45] dogsenses: being healthy has nothing to do with being big and huge

[3:04:20] Akurax: @Reeceboss "enemy" guys... what lives do you live?
[3:04:29] DirtyYankee0: not lifting weights is bad for your health, simply going about life and "eating healthy" isnt good enough for good health @dogsenses
[3:04:39] Caehwynu: i tab target andrew tate fans
[3:04:40] Reeceboss: in real life i am an it engineer who apperas normal but on my online life i am multi rank 1 paladin in azeroth @Akurax

[3:05:23] zoraan: @Shamsis0095 and whats wrong with that
[3:05:25] diskmachin1: @dogsenses being big and strong in your youth and maintaining into old age is huge for your health
[3:05:36] dogsenses: disagree
[3:05:45] dogsenses: being healthy yes not big
[3:05:48] diskmachin1: fym u disagree
[3:05:51] Shamsis0095: @zoraan means you have no game ore ur afraid of women ore you have 0 confidence ore you just ugly as shit a loser

[3:10:56] DirtyYankee0: balance team busy on sod KEKW
[3:11:07] Reeceboss: SOD is for 40 year old men with 3 kids who escape upstairs to get a break
[3:11:07] DirtyYankee0: balancing retail isnt hard either blizzard is just cooked
[3:11:08] Shamsis0095: sod lmao so dogshit
[3:11:14] atrasia94: @sind233 retail is too hardcore for people so they like sod more
[3:11:16] Faketagsy: 36 specs + m+ + raid + arena
[3:11:18] Varaben: @sind233 not that many people play SoD relative to retail. It's a smaller team so they just do what they want. Its seasonal, so the impact is whatever. Lot of reasons.
[3:11:19] IWCarry: @sind233 because they love xaryu
[3:11:42] sind233: A lot of fun takes thanks guys

[3:15:40] Jelleh_RH: Grats on the rank 1 I guess - time to sleep for 4 months
[3:15:41] Feroxita1337: @DirtyYankee0 ofc not im just making fun of them... apparently the devs cried before when raiku was a bit rude in a tweet xD
[3:15:51] Reeceboss: a blizzard employee that was responsible for the mmr change was caught out purchasing purple hairdye on his work shift
[3:15:51] DirtyYankee0: no way for real? KEKW @Feroxita1337
[3:15:58] Izostarx: Or even 1 everyday, at least something

[3:17:09] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[3:17:19] DirtyYankee0: I want 10.2.5 patch notes right fuckin now

[3:17:22] Castorcato: delete treants
[3:17:26] bjervaan89: we need some fire buffs
[3:17:33] xanin92: hopefully not, just started play druid because its op xD
[3:17:35] Saitistreamy: normally they test some changes or nerfs
[3:17:44] wardelswijk: druid nerfs?
[3:17:45] realdreadx: blizz can inject mmr but cant fix the losers.. ppl complain about deflation but complain just as much when ppl get rewards with inflation
[3:17:47] wardelswijk: thank god
[3:17:56] wardelswijk: holy pala / evoker / shaman
[3:17:57] flegzaa: priest?
[3:17:58] IWCarry: disc?
[3:18:02] Blumee9: holy pala feels so strong in solo
[3:18:02] DirtyYankee0: I like when hpal is meta
[3:18:03] br187x: so many pets and pve classes demo unholy and bm are so unecessery to be having so much pets
[3:18:04] DirtyYankee0: fun class
[3:18:07] OptiTV_: hpal already meta
[3:18:08] Saitistreamy: @dreadworldx fuck everyone who bitches about people getting cosmetics in a 20 year old MMO
[3:18:09] Feroxita1337: do you think there will be disc and holy priest buffs?
[3:18:12] YoMamaSoFine69: mw?
[3:18:16] wardelswijk: evoker gets buffs
[3:18:18] Reeceboss: @dreadworldx yeah but glad being 2400 and not percentile based is one of the craziest decisions
[3:18:22] cmxmage: what happend to mehhx? does he stop playing?
[3:18:29] Raikubest: Rdruid > Rsham > hpala > everything else sucks so hard
[3:18:34] Raikubest: but Hpala is good vs Rsham
[3:18:38] DirtyYankee0: thats true is just compared to druid everything feels bad @OptiTV_
[3:18:45] IWCarry: oh man I play priest 🤣
[3:18:49] br187x: ele with demo is so annoying i was watching u and whazz on whazz stream
[3:18:50] flegzaa: damn didnt know priest is that bd
[3:19:04] DirtyYankee0: Druid> Everything
[3:19:05] crosssrealm: reason why pala is good vs shaman? cant sham like dispell al his shields?
[3:19:13] atrasia94: @flegzaa that's why mehx is not competing this time i think
[3:19:16] lightz14: Disc would actually be rly nice if they buffed atonement healing
[3:19:25] br187x: i feel like disc is only good at 2s
[3:19:49] kevinsorbo1337: well isnt that always the problem with atonement. that you cant really balance it
[3:19:50] MarcusFanClub: Why is hpala strong into shaman?
[3:19:58] asdkl2312k3o: @Raikubest imagine druid now if they killed treant only
[3:20:00] asdkl2312k3o: KEKW
[3:20:04] IWCarry: when you dont have to spam rapture and radiance
[3:20:06] OptiTV_: disc needs dmg buff, so not worth casting offensive penance
[3:20:11] tray89: !SONG
[3:20:19] MarcusFanClub: Ah true
[3:20:21] sind233: @lightz14 no because as sp i need spot healing
[3:20:27] br187x: what is tunnel
[3:20:38] lightz14: @sind233 huh
[3:20:42] rembrandt89: feel like disc could get a 10% healing buff and and still not do as much healing as druid
[3:20:45] DirtyYankee0: do you think rogue getting nerfs next week along with druid? @Raikubest
[3:20:55] crampslol: hpal CDs just so good
