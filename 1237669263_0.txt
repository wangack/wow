[2:42:16] Masqerader: woo, just my illusion of ragnaros from saving metzen
[2:42:59] TyndiVelspaz: from what I've been noticing if you want to do the tower with SLands gear you need a ton of vers. OR I'm just bad. my guess is on the latter.
[2:43:33] ardilla808: The new aggrimar shield looks cool with it
[2:43:52] Jet_s: what set is this i dont remember this one
[2:44:04] Firelordxsrx: how?
[2:44:09] GeoKyros: it ain't undoable with SL gear but you have to play almost perfect
[2:44:11] Jet_s: well the tint
[2:44:16] Masqerader: some classes can cheese it easy
[2:44:28] 3663Sharad: So best bet is to use HoA, MoP cloack, and crusader enchant?

[2:54:09] Ellyasveil: KEKW
[2:54:11] Dalsonson: There’s someone on Twitch who has been live for over 1000 Hours bc of an uncapped subathon
[2:54:11] Herzenliegen: @kiymaliekmek idk why don't you ask the thousands still waiting in que
[2:54:11] Shrenko: Im in a 7000 que right now :)
[2:54:13] Scientist__: you can't even buy it

[2:55:50] Herzenliegen: They have even given free game time that's how bad they feel.
[2:56:02] lithium364: its gonna be siege of orgrimmar drought
[2:56:08] Vexxsis: story was amazing
[2:56:09] ArroArroArro: People need to understand, you should play other games with WOW. Like yosi P said, do other stuff, try other games.

[2:56:22] babybabycow: 21 days yea
[2:56:23] Herzenliegen: yep
[2:56:36] Frankzor_19: @Towelliee Would wow get sued by FF14 if they do multiclasses next expac?
[2:56:38] Shrenko: @FreshieFresh ohhh awesome, what server and what lvl are you at?
[2:56:39] Anathdra: so a drought begins the day a patch is released? interesting take

[2:57:07] WordlawXIV: Cuban Maid. Keepo
[2:57:18] Rizec: that shit wont grow back bro
[2:57:26] Vexxsis: gotta do the Manderville dance also

[2:57:41] lithium364: my drought starts when my casual guild clears normal and i get the mounts i wanted from the patch
[2:57:45] pacificmc1: when are we gettting 10.0 news (
[2:57:47] pacificmc1: _:(
[2:57:48] luckfore: 10.0 alpha when? :P
[2:58:14] TheNorthernGiant: Good morning, is there a Toweclaus this year? Thanks for the great streams!
[2:58:15] pacificmc1: what would your best guess be in terms of 10.0 announcement?
[2:58:18] deckardblade: no way 10.0 this year then
[2:58:18] quinraylo: 2023 seqKEK
[2:58:21] Shrenko: 10.0 a Azeroth reborn
[2:58:25] FreshieFresh: @Shrenko thanks man, you too!
[2:58:27] Shrenko: COPIUM
[2:58:35] dalaraz: anything before december sounds too soon
[2:58:46] lithium364: its a scary thought them rushing 10.0 and possible creating another WoD because of release pressure
[2:59:13] Daddyknut: already been a 1 year ish content drought and now after 9.2 there will be a 1 year ish content drought again. zzz
[2:59:14] deckardblade: they should release the actual 10.0 systems patch early then exp later
[2:59:14] Dagomarus: Still not got the mount?
[2:59:20] Orthobullet: Blizzard needs to move HQ to texas
[2:59:37] Ellyasveil: wait? why activision get banned?
[2:59:38] tyrel_jones: Ngl the hq being in southern cali is not helping one bit
[2:59:41] Sarocus: @Orthobullet Fuck that shit
[2:59:49] pacificmc1: I feel like they'll just do a livestream on Youtube
[2:59:57] ElDrakenMan: it boggles my mind bobby isnt on the streets yet
[3:00:09] tyrel_jones: Well i know that
[3:00:14] WaldoTV: i have a question, i dont live in the US but why do so many people and companies move to texas?
[3:00:15] dalaraz: why  was activision banned from game awards ?
[3:00:16] pacificmc1: A pre-recorded one ofc :D
[3:00:28] tyrel_jones: Just saying, it hurts cause Cali’s outrageous covid protocols, i hope the best.
[3:00:30] masenka_: They need to have another major group working on wow outside of Cali
[3:00:30] Gamanis: Are the shelves behind you custom made
[3:00:31] stratiss: arent they doing a virtual blizzcon?
[3:00:36] FreshieFresh: They just need to livestream it themselves
[3:00:37] lithium364: i feel like any live reveal will be awkward
[3:00:37] pacificmc1: @stratiss no it was canceled
[3:00:38] Shrenko: @XcandyyTV taxes I think, Im not from US either haha
[3:00:41] aye_kram: low taxes
[3:00:43] stratiss: ah
[3:01:04] Odinslayer: how's that fair for the devs working on the game though?
[3:01:08] TermsHC: @Towelliee Has anyone heard from Ion at all? He's like a ghost other than written interviews, future grim?
[3:01:09] WaldoTV: oh ok so low taxes
[3:01:30] Kinghorn: just hire people 4Head
[3:01:31] masenka_: i mean long term
[3:01:35] pacificmc1: I feel like blizz can't use the covid excuse anymore... FFXIV released an expansion that was developed 100% during covid without any trouble
[3:01:35] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[3:01:37] bacaflocka: low taxes and it's a republican state so they don't push mask
[3:01:41] ElDrakenMan: @Odinslayer the devs dont want the games shown off till the administrative crap gets sorted out
[3:01:45] LordKain73: Texas....derp...
[3:01:51] FreshieFresh: that's how you get a really shit xpac...they need an insanely good xpac to bounce back at this point too
[3:01:56] Thoreya: @pacificmc1 FF delayed their expansion 3 weeks
[3:01:57] Frankzor_19: lol, that add timing was great
[3:02:00] tyrel_jones: Exactly @pacificmc1
[3:02:02] pacificmc1: @Thoreya 3 weeks is nothing

[3:02:17] abracka_: do they even have a QA team anymore?
[3:02:17] Odinslayer: @drakenPWN that's the problem, it wont get sorted out lol
[3:02:19] WaldoTV: so texas does not push wearing masks?
[3:02:23] tyrel_jones: Still thats only 3 weeks @thoreya
[3:02:39] FreshieFresh: @XcandyyTV it's Texas, so no lol
[3:02:39] bacaflocka: nope
[3:02:41] Thoreya: his statement of "without any trouble" is flawed
[3:02:43] Thoreya: thats all
[3:02:44] Frankzor_19: Frankzor_19 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:02:45] WaldoTV: @FreshieFresh Oh lol
[3:02:56] ElDrakenMan: @Odinslayer then they have a bigger problem because most of those dev teams are going to find other employment
[3:02:59] 無職提督: thats the basic man-month myth issue as software engineering
[3:03:07] LordKain73: They value their freedoms in Texas. Hell yea brotha! :cough:
[3:03:14] Gamanis: are the shelves behind you custom made
[3:03:16] PadidinJones: but you are saying there is a chance for 2022 new expc??
[3:03:23] Thoreya: well thats good
[3:03:23] pacificmc1: God I hope they do take their time with 10.0 though, can't have another trash expansion
[3:03:36] luckfore: raid is huge too
[3:03:40] WaldoTV: where im from, they want everyone to wear masks otherwise you can get fined or get jail time
[3:03:57] LordKain73: @XcandyyTV Good
[3:03:59] bacaflocka: sounds like socialism to me
[3:04:13] Odinslayer: but that what raiders and pvpers wanted? they don't want player power related to it? or am wrong lol
[3:04:36] luckfore: please bring back ap
[3:04:40] stratiss: @XcandyyTV that stinks man, I'm in Florida it's like a completely different country here.
[3:04:43] pacificmc1: AP? eww
[3:04:57] CaliKatNaps: Hello from Malibu @Towelliee and chat, hope you're doing well today
[3:04:59] Dalsonson: I’m fine with it tbh, ZM having no player power makes it more of a cosmetic zone which is fine
[3:05:01] fistofnature: bring back doing maw of souls 10x per hour PogChamp
[3:05:04] Rizec: but you can get soul ash as a torghast replacement from there so if its nice people are still gonna go
[3:05:04] WaldoTV: @stratiss yeah here in south africa they aint playing around
[3:05:05] s7wede: Blizzard needs to understand that player progression and player power are not synonymous. All you need to do is look at the design of the molten front. That was the optimal balance in recent memory
[3:05:05] FreshieFresh: It's not enough. It is a bare basic zone with very little thought put behind it. Even the models are bare basic. They are 100% in maintenance mode
[3:05:15] Odinslayer: cause they've been crying whole 9.1 patch about korthia and how they need to farm it every day for the sockets etc lol
[3:05:21] pacificmc1: Timeless Isle was awesome
[3:05:45] vetements07: paragraph andys
[3:05:55] stratiss: Make it alt friendly if you add extra power
[3:06:00] Masqerader: @Odinslayer people wouldn't care if they didn't have a stupid long rep grind
[3:06:07] Masqerader: Benthic gear
[3:06:09] Dalsonson: Benthic
[3:06:10] Masqerader: good times
[3:06:10] Kinghorn: but that was fuuun
[3:06:11] masenka_: benthic gear with sockets!
[3:06:17] dalaraz: pearl gear that you must spam to get sockets too sigh
[3:06:20] Kinghorn: playing the gamba machine
[3:06:22] Odinslayer: i mean if ZM just like the timeless isle it would be just wonderful, can't remember TImeless isle has any player power related to it
[3:06:27] FreshieFresh: cAtCh Up MeChAnIcS
[3:06:37] GermanBacon: i just hate that will most likely have to replace my legy bow kinamaFeelsbad
[3:06:47] Odinslayer: @Masqerader there is a long rep grind though but it has nothing to do with player power in it
[3:06:48] WaldoTV: one expansion that i really like was MOP
[3:06:52] WaldoTV: liked
[3:07:00] quinraylo: wish wow was more alt friendly when i play ff14 i can do all on one character

[3:16:55] toddj76: screw you blizzard. I was diehard player from the beginning untill you screwed the whole game with your realm mergers in MoP and then I came back for legion and couldnt fly until i jumped through all your hoops
[3:17:12] Royin2k3: she could be redeemed but she cannot avoid whats been donr
[3:17:27] abbosss: @toddj76 sorry, but what exactly does realm merging have to do with flying?
[3:17:35] tyrel_jones: Flying was east to get in Legion @toddj76
[3:17:38] tyrel_jones: Easy*
[3:17:49] luckfore: hope its better than nyalotha cinematic  lol
[3:17:52] idenkaz_: what i found more interesting is that ppl still test ptr and dont get shit for it KEKW

[3:19:04] rauko_64: so good sylvanas becomes the new jailer?
[3:19:04] PrimalRain: he's just barely had any story so hard to be invested
[3:19:09] SavageCheez: Story hasn't been the same since Metzen left
[3:19:13] Mactub: na if you need books and external sources to tell your story thats shitty story telling imo
[3:19:27] GlakusWoW: i mean the dialogues from bolvar saying " zoval is been defeated" were elaked 2 weeks ago so
[3:19:27] WaldoTV: Oh towelliee i wanted to ask, are going to play HZD at some point? and have you played it before?
[3:19:47] lithium364: lmao yeah someone posted boosing advertisement in the council forum LUL
[3:19:51] borisdic: Hey @Towelliee Whats your advice on applying getting into better guilds?
[3:19:56] Odinslayer: i mean CC drama proves that the problem is the community and the players and not the devs lol
[3:20:06] xirangeix: Horizon zero dawn?
[3:20:08] xirangeix: I guess
[3:20:08] Ellyasveil: horizon zero dawn?
[3:20:19] Exusprime: Not trying to bash but its really weird that the book cant even be released because they clearly dont know where they are going with the content in the game. its so haphazard
[3:20:21] tyrel_jones: I think its a bit of both @odinslayer
[3:20:23] WaldoTV: yes horizon zero dawn
[3:20:23] abbosss: the people they recruited for CC were tash
[3:20:26] abbosss: trash*
[3:20:30] Scientist__: ijpKEK
[3:20:31] Kinghorn: I voted HZD
[3:20:32] tyrel_jones: But there isnt much of one
[3:20:38] s7wede: @Towelliee They already kicked a person off it because he created a public discord to talk the community about their issues. He didn't immediately ban a racist troll who said the reason he quit was because of too many black NPC's in Stormwind so Blizzard decided he was platforming a racist and kicked him
[3:20:40] Kinghorn: cobaltRage
[3:20:47] idenkaz_: embrase what WoW truly is and cut the bullshit. its a service game handle it like one.
[3:21:08] abbosss: @s7wede that is such a pathetic reach lol, blizzard just kicked him, none of that shit
[3:21:16] abbosss: they didn't say any of that
[3:21:16] WaldoTV: i voted HZD LUL
[3:21:19] WaldoTV: but its ok
[3:21:22] Kromede: prosident

[3:22:09] idenkaz_: worse than wildstar?
[3:22:10] babybabycow: OH DEER
[3:22:10] Odinslayer: @tyrel_jones i dunno about that lol, its clearly a good way to communicate with the devs and the people who got invited made it a shithole lol
[3:22:11] idenkaz_: sry
[3:22:12] abbosss: I mean ya he fucked up, but putting words in blizzards mouth is such disingenuous and not helpful to anyone
[3:22:13] s7wede: @abbosss That is the only public reason one could surmise to be a valid reason.
[3:22:26] mrrazputin: But on Council forum there is noone to comunicate
[3:22:26] luckfore: why would he create a discord? hes not blizzard lol
[3:22:35] abbosss: proper class representation
[3:22:35] Shrenko: to create more toxicity
[3:22:39] abbosss: for starters
[3:22:42] plushack: well it's PR
[3:22:46] Mactub: PR move
[3:22:47] dalaraz: they just added anotehr wall between community and devs
[3:22:51] WaldoTV: what was the twitch council thing for?
[3:22:52] Exusprime: @babybabycow i see what u did deer
[3:22:56] idenkaz_: cmom now T you know why. its not that hard to grasp. you know why
[3:22:57] postboy710: :)
[3:22:58] Dagomarus: Council is the wrong word for what they do any way, it was more of committee
[3:23:01] gooni_coyg: can we get ur elvui profile somewhere? Looks clean
[3:23:09] postboy710: HeyGUys
[3:23:14] thebluedoll: democracy doesn't work? ok
[3:23:31] Mactub: didnt say it was good PR, but with the 9.1.5 debacle they wanted to show theyre 'reaching' out to the community
[3:23:33] abbosss: @s7wede I mean okay, all things considered, what exactly did he bring positive to the council to ignore the discord?
[3:23:34] Thoreya: LUL
[3:23:34] plushack: For you who actually know game for ages, for someone who don't really follow what is happening and seeing news about PR it's good
[3:23:35] Funderik: oh well if it works great, if not whatever nothings changed, pr or not it's something new they are trying.
[3:23:35] mrelgaato: !ui

[3:24:00] lithium364: didnt john hight got promoted this week?
[3:24:00] PvtHudson093: how many councils is that now?
[3:24:09] Masqerader: Clearly they never heard of the saying "to many cooks in the kitchen spoils the broth"
[3:24:19] Odinslayer: i mean the whole purpose of the CC is to have more communication with the devs, the community been crying for ages for more communications or am i wrong? lol
[3:24:22] Funderik: it's like player mods in osrs or mentors in ff14, it's not a new concept and has proven to work.
[3:24:26] babybabycow: they're so disconnected from their own game, thats why i quit and went to ffxiv LULW
[3:24:28] IllusiOGnarly: the purpose of the community council is for blizzard to pretend to casuals like any player has a voice
[3:24:29] abbosss: it would have been nice to have high skilled players of each class give their feedback, at least that was my interpretation on the Community Council
[3:24:30] Masqerader: *too
[3:25:09] WaldoTV: is the mage tower better on you brewmaster towelliee?
[3:25:38] s7wede: @abbosss He created at least 20% of all threads that currently exist on the forum. He was actively doing exactly what he recruited to do.
[3:26:30] s7wede: @abbosss Only the first wave of invite went out, so you will probably get some world first raider feedback at some point
[3:26:31] Moobot: Get the Prime Gaming Bundle in Genshin Impact now - https://gaming.amazon.com/loot/genshinimpact?ref%20=SM_GI_TWL_CB
[3:27:15] abbosss: @s7wede he himself said he was "given no guidelines" therefore there was no way for him to to "know what to do" so in the end he was just acting however he thought he should
[3:27:47] abbosss: not for "what he was recruited"
[3:27:49] WhiteKnight74648: Good Morning
[3:28:11] Xsilentghost: dru

[3:34:02] TheMosky94: @Towelliee YEAAAh man thats whAt im waiting for
[3:34:11] TheMosky94: @Towelliee this game needs RAID
[3:34:14] maybe_torq: You think that would be a good experience with PvE body blocking?
[3:34:19] dalaraz: with how clunky colision is in new world,raids will be so fun bad
[3:34:24] maybe_torq: I feel like that would be a mess
[3:34:31] essadis: I want a world boss.  almost like Den Mother but bigger and bigger arena area

[3:35:20] N3llee: those marketing guys are working overtime
[3:35:40] Odinslayer: so deep
[3:35:42] PraxicThorn: tech debt is used pretty commonly on my team
[3:35:48] smashwow: tech debt maybe, not bug debt
[3:36:06] MrTrevinoo: marketing does nothing bout that bug debt lol its the designer talk in him
[3:36:24] obbi87: They really need a LFG system, spammng trade or Gchat is so old school
[3:36:34] Shrenko: monkaS
[3:36:37] PraxicThorn: @obbi87 definitely
[3:36:37] Buttscratchrr: I respect New world DEVs taking time to sit down and do this! excited to see what's to come.

[3:38:34] MrTrevinoo: whoa, protecting streamers lol nice
[3:38:40] N3llee: @Towelliee did you see the youtube video David Fried did about Blizz? He was a former quest designer and worked WC3 remake. Its interesting.
[3:39:20] abracka_: i call BS on that automatic banning he just said

[3:39:42] HecticSpaniard: i believe him :)
[3:39:44] PsY_CrO: he is full of shit and he knows it
[3:39:51] abracka_: there's like 400 vids of showcasing the automatic banning with multiple reports on one person
[3:39:58] Shrenko: mass reports = a bot bans the player getting mass reported @Towelliee
[3:40:03] E_Z24: they HAVE to say that...otherwise it will get abused more than it is
[3:40:19] MrTrevinoo: I think Sonii was one of the unfortunate to have been mass reported and banned lol
[3:40:19] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:40:29] xsveninatorx: gms probably lean towards banning in that scenario, easier to preemptive ban then unban
[3:40:36] manmower: AI humans
[3:40:45] Buttscratchrr: thats when they look into when you appeal ur ban
[3:41:03] Sharpie600rr: Oh we screwed you over.. oh, oh well its for the greater good
[3:41:05] nimrhen: he's just saying that the system is not automatically banning them, but the people handing reports could just have guidelines to ban over X reports

[4:04:14] Varchon: it's a story based game, he doesn't like story based games...
[4:04:17] Masqerader: he did nothin wrong, he voiced his opinion of a game
[4:04:35] Tharia: ah ok. so if I do the story and hate it anyway, that's fine?
[4:04:38] Molvonos: @Masqerader Incorrect.
[4:04:40] Tharia: so lame
[4:04:44] dalaraz: that sounds dumb anyway :p
[4:04:54] Kisswani: I had a problem with parts of the EW story , but I was terrified to comment or write anything about it KEKW
[4:05:03] Masqerader: @Molvonos he kinda didn't mention that part till after lol
