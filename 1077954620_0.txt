[3:44:03] pewtanblot: 2020Suspicious gn i guess @Andles1
[3:44:05] GiantDuckKing: I'm shocked streamers like Hasan, Jake, Myth, etc don't all play on a Minecraft server together instead. It's new to their audiences, it helps grow them into Minecraft folks that have turned out in droves, and they could control who is in it easily. I don't see the novelty in another rust server when they can do new stuff.

[3:45:29] GiantDuckKing: @NightWaddie True, I'm just surprised they're gonna do Rust again instead of something new. I don't think it would fee the same.
[3:45:31] pottsy1: I think u blinded the Druid in human form (which is awesome), so have to blind after it
[3:45:44] pottsy1: Sap*
[3:46:22] breekicheeki9: @pottsy1 that would be ideal, the dispells on FF would need to be perfect to vanish

[3:46:58] GiantDuckKing: @NightWaddie I haven't played it, so I'll take your word for it. I feel like if kids play Minecraft it's gotta be easy too. I haven't played that since it released as Java before 1.0 XD

[3:49:21] bohan_: healer muted
[3:49:54] GiantDuckKing: I heard ARK was similar and has private servers you can make. I feel like dinosaurs becoming the new horses would be funny, but idk if there are things like Helicopters that people loved.
