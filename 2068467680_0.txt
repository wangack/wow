[0:22:37] Crille3: Trade for teir set
[0:22:46] Berrasw3: you have better i believe
[0:22:51] Faeynna: Tbf, the biggest difference from LFR to Normal is that you might need to do stuff with the seeds.
[0:22:58] Faeynna: Depending on the dps. :D
[0:23:03] sapsi_: @Faeynna aye!

[0:28:08] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[0:28:38] StreamElements: Make sure to check out all of my social media: Linktree.com/snowmixy
[0:29:43] Faeynna: No
[0:29:51] Faeynna: You can do LFR -> Normal -> Heroic
[0:29:57] Faeynna: The chance will be the same
[0:30:02] Faeynna: It already rolled for you
[0:30:19] sapsi_: theres the thing then if u join heroic, gotta know tacs or ppl kick you, toxic ppl these days.. Kappa
[0:30:21] Faeynna: Not true
[0:30:35] Faeynna: Blizzard stated that only the highest you do is counting
[0:30:37] sapsi_: @Faeynna and yes thats true
[0:30:38] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[0:30:45] its__fate: the chance is higher for heroic its why i only did heroic and got it in the 5th week
[0:31:05] Faeynna: But you don't lower the chance of doing lfr and normal
[0:31:13] the_fakh: hc takes the chance from normal and lf
[0:31:18] the_fakh: it combines them
[0:31:19] Faeynna: Yes you can
[0:31:25] the_fakh: no you still have normal and hc
[0:31:31] Faeynna: HC is LFR + Normal + HC chance
[0:31:40] the_fakh: okay look
[0:31:46] Faeynna: It's very confusing. :D
[0:31:51] sapsi_: listen the fakh
[0:31:53] sapsi_: :D
[0:32:24] sapsi_: LUL
[0:32:31] sapsi_: okay okay
[0:32:34] the_fakh: lets say lfr is 0.5% normal is 1% and hc is 1.5 alone ! if u do hc straight you get 3%
[0:32:48] the_fakh: if u do lfr first
[0:32:52] the_fakh: the 0.5% is gone
[0:33:01] the_fakh: idk about the %
[0:33:08] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[0:33:10] the_fakh: but thats how its added up
[0:33:22] Faeynna: You don't lower the chance. :)
[0:33:31] Faeynna: The game has already rolled for you
[0:33:38] StreamElements: Download Puzzles & Survival now! Get to headquarter Level 5, attack a zombie lair in an alliance and get a 5-star hero with me to support the stream! https://strms.net/puzzles_snowmixy
[0:33:41] sapsi_: but if u do it on every difficult u still have the cnahce to get it and the best trinket on game atm for pally
[0:33:47] the_fakh: wdym by the game rolled for her?
[0:34:28] Faeynna: Game has already rolled every reset. Is the legendary dropping from LFR, Normal, Heroic, Mythic.
[0:34:58] Berrasw3: either way it was good you did it on LFR so you saw the bossfight :D
[0:35:02] Faeynna: It might be that it drops on Heroic for you. Then doing the LFR and Normal is useless.
[0:35:16] sapsi_: @Berrasw3 didnt see the important mechanics tho ;)
[0:35:25] Faeynna: But if it for example drops on LFR for you that week, then it will also be given to you in Normal and HC.
[0:35:36] Berrasw3: @Berrasw3 nah but in general i mean :D
[0:35:38] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[0:35:55] Faeynna: But doing HC first, will increase the chances across the board for the next reset for LFR, Normal and HC to drop it.
[0:36:29] sapsi_: but dont worry, my guildies have done the raid on hc everyweek and still only 1 had it drop :D
[0:36:53] Faeynna: Yeah we are super unlucky, cleared the raid on HC from week 3.
[0:36:57] sapsi_: whats that like 13 weeks now or 14?
[0:36:57] Faeynna: And we have gotten 1 legendary.
[0:37:12] Faeynna: And it went to our MT prot warrior that doesn't wanna play dps. :D
[0:37:21] sapsi_: @Faeynna ouch
[0:37:37] sapsi_: stings doesnt it :D
[0:37:49] Faeynna: It does. But the rest of us is praying. :D
[0:38:03] sapsi_: like "keep praying u noobs" :D:D:D:
[0:38:08] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[0:38:38] Faeynna: @sapsi_ ayepp! I think our 2nd tank might have gotten it from LFR on one of his alts as well
