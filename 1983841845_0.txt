[3:58:44] SushiLaser: they were in the raid
[3:58:48] Draleric: Its a GDKP run, its not an OnlyFangs full guild run
[3:58:53] MiniHeals350: This raid system sucks due to no static raid grp means you either pay butloads for the items or just never get bis
[3:58:55] PaperbackWritter: what is the warlock name?
[3:59:09] Heavenly_Heathen: Ayygord?
[3:59:32] EngeltheFallen: there is a combo of Jin'do's Bag of Whammies from ZG and a claw from BWL you could use
[3:59:41] PaperbackWritter: https://era.raider.io/characters/us/defias-pillager/ayygord a quick stalking
[4:00:05] EngeltheFallen: that raider app is great for when shit goes wrong
[4:00:17] Draleric: ICANT
[4:00:20] JohnnysHappyHideout: Based
[4:00:35] MiniHeals350: just do it off stream maybe lol
[4:00:39] EngeltheFallen: Claw of Chromaggus from BWL is the other itms for the weapon offhand combo
[4:00:47] thatzombiepunk: The auctions are as brutal as everything else in hardcore damn

[4:01:20] ShadoStream: RMT=real money trading
[4:01:21] MiniHeals350: tomorrow cobalt has the staff :P
[4:01:32] DerpyTurtle: they paid irl dollars for ingame gold. using 3rd parties
[4:01:35] Bishox: 1k gold is $50 , easy gear
[4:01:42] hatechatter: tmr he gave it to you out of the goodness of his heart :)
[4:02:08] DerpyTurtle: @Bishox How would you know that cobaltSus
[4:02:15] dumpdeer: gold buyers beware LUL
[4:02:37] PaperbackWritter: it was ayygord indeed
[4:02:55] SummonMaggie: lol saying he was going to stop at 1850 broke him
[4:02:57] MiniHeals350: these guys are scummy
[4:03:26] QtPaj: I hate gdkps
[4:03:34] Imaril_1: Same
[4:03:55] Heavenly_Heathen: What other options are there to disperse the loot?
[4:04:05] fraghil: kinda not fun to watch the bid outs it's like super exploitation energy
[4:04:10] PaperbackWritter: friendship :)
[4:04:14] QtPaj: Was doing a Karazhan gdkp once and they were breathing down my neck about buying the stuff dropping
[4:04:33] Wrainth: Dang is the raid already done
[4:04:44] EngeltheFallen: second raid will start soon
[4:04:44] Heavenly_Heathen: One more raid dungeon after this :)
[4:04:46] Triscone: GDKP ensures that everyone gets something for their time. I have a problem with botting, but actually think GDKP may be the best loot system
[4:04:51] EngeltheFallen: there is some cheaper stuff in zg
[4:04:58] EngeltheFallen: not as good, but ok
[4:04:58] Linnuck: did you get any good drops cobalt?
[4:05:00] frigidwhether: good staves in ZG maybe?
[4:05:12] EngeltheFallen: he lost a bid for the item he wanted
[4:05:14] PaperbackWritter: Sadge
[4:05:17] SushiLaser: there's one in zg but it's not as good
[4:05:17] EngeltheFallen: but it was really, really high priced
[4:05:17] JohnnysHappyHideout: At least you made a fuckton of gold.
[4:05:17] Linnuck: NotLikeThis
[4:05:22] PaperbackWritter: Staff FeelsOhWait
[4:05:25] Hellvpq: we are also bummed about it man FeelsBadMan
[4:05:30] QtPaj: @Triscone In the one I went I didn't get anything because I had too bad gear (even though I had prebis)
[4:05:30] Linnuck: Sadge
[4:05:45] EngeltheFallen: thicc
[4:05:50] fraghil: if the voice chat wasn't doing scare tactic and telling folks they're missing out and bid higher it'd be less ick
[4:06:08] EngeltheFallen: they are not lying'
[4:06:15] EngeltheFallen: that staff is rare
[4:06:27] EngeltheFallen: and not everyone here will do the raid 10 times more to see it again
[4:06:54] fraghil: Let the bidders decide that though don't egg them on about it
[4:07:07] Nightbot: Use this link to buy anything from Amazon to support Cobaltstreak -> https://tinyurl.com/cobaltamazon
[4:07:27] EngeltheFallen: the raid leader should be letting people know what they should bid on to better themselves for future raids
[4:07:36] EngeltheFallen: this is the start of their plans not the end
[4:08:02] EngeltheFallen: like some of this group will go to MC, but most will not
[4:08:11] EngeltheFallen: those tht go will be the ones saggressively getting loot
[4:08:51] JohnnysHappyHideout: @EngeltheFallen True and real.
[4:09:19] EngeltheFallen: also we may have lost the rod but we still got that trinket which is bis for a long ass time
[4:09:27] frozenbread_: It's only good for healers
[4:09:38] Heavenly_Heathen: What does bis stand for?
[4:09:44] Centurion_Havoc: a lot
[4:09:56] Heavenly_Heathen: Forsure, thank you :)
[4:10:08] Triscone: probably looking at about a 300g payout
[4:10:21] smiloe: not a bad payout
[4:10:50] EngeltheFallen: take the cash from tonight and big dick bid next time
[4:10:55] SushiLaser: time to go level your bank alt FeelsDankMan
[4:10:56] QtPaj: Are you playing Season of Discovery Cobalt?

[4:11:41] rdg_99: Thats disgusting, do you have a link?
[4:11:45] EngeltheFallen: what do you mean bots? i thought hot girls just loved me on twitter <.<
[4:11:52] Draleric: chgaga15 its for the 20 people that raided
[4:11:55] QtPaj: @MiniHeals350 I wanted to do Shaman tank but my friends wanted to play Alliance so I'm gonna test out the paladin!
[4:12:04] Nightbot: Come join Cobalt's Discord for live notifications, MTG chat and more! https://discord.gg/lokor
[4:12:06] JohnnysHappyHideout: @EngeltheFallen They do, but only you, most of us aren't so lucky. Sadge
[4:12:10] Heavenly_Heathen: @chgaga15 Nope, the pot is split among the people that raided.  Not everyone who raided is in the same guild
[4:12:11] Centurion_Havoc: gotta wonder the % of bots on twitter now. My guess is north of 50%
[4:12:13] chgaga15: @Draleric i thought soda would take it all LuL
[4:12:32] Triscone: @chgaga15 the pot is split amongst all raider sin the group in almost all standard cases
[4:12:44] MiniHeals350: @QtPaj paladin looks funn
[4:13:14] EngeltheFallen: by 1
[4:13:21] Draleric: NOOO

[4:15:21] EngeltheFallen: KEKW
[4:16:04] PaperbackWritter: you had, the dude would totally stop at 1850 NODDERS
[4:16:15] EngeltheFallen: he would have went at least 2k
[4:16:33] livingpot: these gdkp raids are expensive =)
[4:16:52] Triscone: should you boon your buffs?
[4:17:13] JohnnysHappyHideout: You've still got a sickass mount, I call that a victory.
[4:17:22] clam__5: the sickest mount
[4:17:48] SushiLaser: aww mechano-striders are my favorite mounts :(
[4:18:15] Heavenly_Heathen: Woop, confirmation is was Ayygord

[4:18:49] Cakedonut: not at all Kappa
[4:18:59] EngeltheFallen: so what you need to do now is making sure he suffers an accident in ZG that cannot be linked back to you
[4:19:05] JohnnysHappyHideout: PJSugar
[4:19:18] SushiLaser: I'll make him an offer, he can't refuse

[4:20:05] MiniHeals350: if he sees it
[4:20:08] EngeltheFallen: like could have upgraded the rest of your shit to this tier for 2k
[4:20:31] SushiLaser: 18% drop rate is pretty nice
[4:20:35] Centurion_Havoc: Not bad tbh
[4:20:44] frozenbread_: It's a short raid CD tho, not a full week, that's good
[4:21:02] Heavenly_Heathen: The difference between 8 and 9 is one. It's just one lmao
[4:21:24] Ap0c4lyptyc: OMEGALUL
[4:21:30] Hellvpq: YEAH LUL
