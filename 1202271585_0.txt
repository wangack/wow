[0:10:34] legoduplotr: you are come back  i see man :O
[0:11:13] Red_Dead_Redeem: earliest 9.2 will come out is like in 2 weeks which is doubtful
[0:11:22] Thoreya: First time following in a couple months. 9.2 hype !!!
[0:11:36] zardistus: good morning towelliee and hammer squad
[0:11:46] amricatt: I'm under the impression that it's been a content drought as well and figured that's why most haven't been doing WoW.
[0:11:46] Red_Dead_Redeem: Good morning to all
[0:12:01] MiiRasmus: Whats happening in 9.2?
[0:12:13] JangoMigo: ojhhhhhhhhhhhh shizzzzzzzzz
[0:12:14] Secondbreakfasttt: @Red_Dead_Redeem patch is not even in PTR yet, lietraly no way
[0:12:17] nitemare34godd: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towLets towGo towLets towLets towGo towLets

[0:12:31] MiiRasmus: Oh
[0:12:36] MiiRasmus: Lol
[0:12:37] valip: do u guys think there will be 9.4 or it will stop at 9.3?
[0:12:50] Shrenko: it will stop at 9.2 is my guess
[0:12:51] Red_Dead_Redeem: @mellkorrrrr then most likely late December early January if that is the case
[0:13:13] valip: @Shrenko well i hope so xd
[0:13:14] Thoreya: my predictions are 9.2 gonna be january 25th then we get a 9.2.5 then 10.0
[0:13:24] convyz: is it worth resubbing rn? havent played an mmo in like 6months
[0:13:35] Buttscratchrr: Can’t be to much wow already said their not expanding in the near future just working on game issues  here and out pretty much
[0:13:40] Shrenko: @convyz noppe
[0:13:42] Thunderbrew: The announcement that really matters is Lich King Classic or 10.0
[0:13:43] Secondbreakfasttt: i'd say early Feb
[0:14:07] obbi87: @valip 9.2 is the last
[0:14:19] Buttscratchrr: Anyone play PTR of new world yesterday that new void weapon is pretty bad ass!
[0:14:20] valip: @obbi87 how can u be sure about it?
[0:14:43] Shrenko: hes not @valip its just a wild theory
[0:14:45] obbi87: @valip No one want SL anymore, Ion has hinted at 9.2 is the last patch aswell
[0:14:45] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah most likely Early Feb since it's not even on PTR and they just released a patch
[0:15:05] Thoreya: They’re gonna prob make a 9.2.5 for balancing/QoL stuff
[0:15:09] Thoreya: Then end
[0:15:17] Thunderbrew: Why are so few people streaming New World now?
[0:15:27] Thoreya: Game isn’t good imo
[0:15:38] valip: yes i want to let the Jailer win and literally reset everyting and make us go back and hunt boars
[0:15:42] Secondbreakfasttt: not so much to do  in NW
[0:15:47] Piebringer619: GLAD TOWEL you WENT BACK TO ROOTS
[0:15:51] Red_Dead_Redeem: I don't care for New world either but that's just me
[0:15:53] Shrenko: definetly not worth paying a sub for wow at this time
[0:15:56] Secondbreakfasttt: Chest runs kinda meh
[0:16:05] obbi87: @Piebringer619 He is not, said it amy times, only here because of the announcment
[0:16:16] Shrenko: imo
[0:16:47] luckfore: wow? Pog
[0:16:55] Buttscratchrr: People need to realize why stream a game that is done.   It will be once in a while thing with wow here and out
[0:16:57] Red_Dead_Redeem: Towelliee doing Towelliee things
[0:17:03] Thunderbrew: So he plays WoW today and then back to New World?
[0:17:20] valip: are there any hints for the next expansion or theories btw?
[0:17:23] Shrenko: no, to Battlefield, it launches tomorrow early access @Thunderbrew
[0:17:35] kharditv: wow geefBruh
[0:17:42] Xoomie81: fat gamer stream stasring?
[0:17:45] kharditv: game beyond redemption
[0:17:50] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOTLK Classic announcement, when?
[0:17:53] RaidBossMike: its funny how people complain about both NW and WoW and yet they still play it.
[0:17:56] Shrenko: Jackfrags just released 25min of new Battlefield gameplay, it looks SO much better than beta
[0:17:56] Mallaes: towBolvar It's still there :D
[0:17:58] Secondbreakfasttt: make it alt friendly, get ridoff timegating rep grind sheat i'll give a go maybe
[0:18:06] Shrenko: @ncroMike Im not :D
[0:18:16] RaidBossMike: i love both
[0:18:29] RaidBossMike: both are good games and games sometimes break but gets fix
[0:18:32] Shrenko: Im sweating gw2
[0:18:43] RaidBossMike: i literally just reinstalled it

[0:18:47] RaidBossMike: not even an hour agoHAHAHA
[0:18:51] Thunderbrew: @ncroMike Complaining is as fun for some people as playing the games
[0:19:03] Thoreya: yeah idk as soon as wow drops a good patch prob 9.2 ull see everyone back
[0:19:08] Shrenko: Im literally playing it 16 hours a day when Im not at work monkaS
[0:19:08] valip: lost ark release will be big. i could convince my friends to start it who have never played any games like this
[0:19:15] Thoreya: everyone just took a hiatus bc it was the best time when everything happened
[0:19:17] Red_Dead_Redeem: I never played NW and have no want to play that game, I still play WoW bc I like the game...to each their own
[0:19:25] Secondbreakfasttt: you cannot play wow while not complaning this is the way LUL
[0:19:30] luckfore: good to hear wow music again :D
[0:19:34] RaidBossMike: @Thoreya thats being said every patch but yet it always seems to dissapoint people
[0:19:40] kharditv: @red_dead_redeem a one trick andie Kappa
[0:19:49] Red_Dead_Redeem: @kharditv LUL
[0:19:49] Buttscratchrr: New world will fill any wow void you might have it is the future of that kind of mmo
[0:20:10] Thoreya: ^?
[0:20:27] Thoreya: @ncroMike people trying to find perfection will forever be lost
[0:20:31] RaidBossMike: both games are in comparable anyways
[0:20:32] Red_Dead_Redeem: wow what kind of crack pot theory is that?
[0:20:40] RaidBossMike: HAHAHAH too right @Thoreya
[0:20:45] RaidBossMike: so lettem hate ay?
[0:20:50] RaidBossMike: i enjoy both
[0:20:55] RaidBossMike: both ARE different
[0:21:06] CrazyAlien4ever: new world is a cheap copy of wow , so leave it like that
[0:21:17] Sikkbass: Nothing beats the magic of WoW
[0:21:19] Shrenko: they are very different games
[0:21:19] kharditv: I'm sorry wow lost me with those allegations and left a huge bad reputation
[0:21:25] Red_Dead_Redeem: I don't hate on pple for liking what they like, do your thing and be happy doing what you do
[0:21:26] Secondbreakfasttt: @ncroMike it's health mind set and we do not do that here lol
[0:21:38] RaidBossMike: i never said it was the same
[0:21:41] Shrenko: yeah Blizzard has to make some insane big moves to get me back to WoW
[0:21:47] RaidBossMike: i said you cannot compare the both because they are different
[0:21:50] mushonovster: what is the name of this game please
[0:22:03] RaidBossMike: and no matter how you wanna put it, both are still good games
[0:22:05] Nehcrom: WoW needs to go isometric and I am all game ;)
[0:22:06] RaidBossMike: BOTH
[0:22:08] Sikkbass: @kharditv I think a lot of people are putting too much weight on the allegations, the game itself has been great for years and has let itself down in the last few years but it's back on the rise now because Blizzard are forced to listen to consumers
[0:22:34] VrtniPatuljak: Sikkbass game has been meh since mop
[0:22:51] valip: mop was the best in my opinion
[0:22:54] Red_Dead_Redeem: just announce WOTLK already I want to own as blood DK
[0:23:00] kharditv: @sikkbass I know but still as a survivor I won't accept wow
[0:23:02] Red_Dead_Redeem: *classic
[0:23:06] Buttscratchrr: Only thing I look forward is classic WOTLk that is the only reason I would ever play wow again…
[0:23:07] Shrenko: @Sikkbass they have said that multiple times before, but allways ending up going silent... with this new counciler lets hope that change that
[0:23:28] Sikkbass: @VrtniPatuljak That's your opinion, raiding has been great for me and M+ has been a distraction.  If you find skillcaps for you in the game you will always feel a love for the game
[0:23:31] RaidBossMike: what i dont understand is though, why do people prefer the old 1919 vanilla wow
[0:23:33] Sikkbass: The fundamentals haven't changed
[0:23:43] Thoreya: The game isn’t even that bad atm with all the QoL changes there’s just nothing to do
[0:23:44] notguiilty: @Sikkbass how is it on the rise the council is not active yet and we know nothing about 9.2
[0:23:48] Thoreya: So I just do keys
[0:24:03] VrtniPatuljak: Sikkbass ppl that only play wow, quite delusional
[0:24:07] notguiilty: oh and i bet the council is gonna be an echo chamber
[0:24:08] Sikkbass: @notguiilty Don't you think Blizz is at it's worst right now?  The only way is improvement for them right now
[0:24:09] Thoreya: And no other game intirigues me at all and I’d rather play in traffic then pretend to like a game
[0:24:24] bakurathewolf: moring
[0:24:29] Thunderbrew: Is Asmongold on the Community Council?
[0:24:29] Ragzen: wow is not worth it meh
[0:24:38] Saleos_Reaper: classic wotlk???
[0:24:45] Jinkenss: IonJam
[0:25:03] notguiilty: @Sikkbass thats what we thought with Bfa and we got SL. Blizz will always find a way to lower the bar even further
[0:25:06] bakurathewolf: @Thunderbrew i think so
[0:25:27] Red_Dead_Redeem: wow not worth it, NW not going to take over anytime soon..we just do what we do and be happy doing it
[0:25:35] AndwariTV: i dont know, SL felt not that bad in the beginning
[0:25:46] AndwariTV: i think it was mostly the huge time til the first patch
[0:25:48] Sikkbass: @notguiilty That period is not even close to where they are now, don't kid yourself.  We all know Blizz has been in decline for years but the last year has been the worst for years
[0:25:49] Thoreya: SL was great in the first 2 months
[0:25:52] Sikkbass: With the lawsuit etc
[0:25:56] Thoreya: they broke records that first quarter
[0:26:00] Thoreya: but content staled out after
[0:26:06] Thoreya: and QoL stuff didnt change at all
[0:26:06] Red_Dead_Redeem: SL better than BFA for sure
[0:26:28] Thoreya: i miss bfa dungeons
[0:26:29] Thoreya: cant lie
[0:26:29] notguiilty: @Thoreya yeah cause everyone was inside with nothing to do other then to game
[0:26:29] Red_Dead_Redeem: BFA pissed me off LUL
[0:26:31] RaidBossMike: isnt LA last day today?
[0:26:34] nitemare34godd: no way bfa was awesome
[0:26:48] AndwariTV: @ncroMike yes
[0:26:50] UnholyLP: @ncroMike yep
[0:26:50] Thunderbrew: WoD and SL worst expansions.
[0:26:52] RaidBossMike: dang
[0:26:57] RaidBossMike: thanks @Thunderbrew
[0:27:03] Thoreya: @notguiilty lol
[0:27:04] Sikkbass: I'm happy to see @Towelliee actually play and talk about WoW tbh
[0:27:09] mezza77: Imagine if they ended the announcement stream with the new expansion reveal… unlikely I know
[0:27:12] Red_Dead_Redeem: CATA was worst expansion hands down
[0:27:17] Thoreya: cata was trash
[0:27:23] TheGaoSora: People really believe they'll announce 9.2?...
[0:27:23] Thoreya: agreed @Red_Dead_Redeem
[0:27:23] RaidBossMike: thats what i heard played and felt @Red_Dead_Redeem
[0:27:28] RaidBossMike: but stuck with it
[0:27:33] RaidBossMike: idk why
[0:27:36] nitemare34godd: the blue post said they were
[0:27:41] Serp91: did he leave wow because of lack of content or because of the trial scandal ?
[0:27:50] Thoreya: @TheOmniSora they literally announced theyre previewing it today
[0:27:52] flebbooo: Nah nah Cata was the bomb! I still think the revamp of the old world is super underated

[0:28:02] mezza77: @theomnisora ermmmm…
[0:28:07] Thoreya: i quit bc of the world revamp. thought that was so stupid haha
[0:28:14] TheGaoSora: @Thoreya was there another blue post besides that short one?
[0:28:14] Shrenko: @TheOmniSora its officially announced they are announcing it today..?
[0:28:25] RaidBossMike: what is @Shrenko
[0:28:38] Shrenko: @ncroMike the 9.2 announcement
[0:28:42] RaidBossMike: ahhh
[0:28:45] Red_Dead_Redeem: second worst expansion as WOD but PvP was good in WOD
[0:28:46] RaidBossMike: yall think itll be a good 1?
[0:28:47] Thoreya: @TheOmniSora they said theyre previewing 9.2 today. they tweeted it yesterday
[0:29:09] TheGaoSora: @Thoreya ahh I see mb, thought it's about that short post that said nothing about it
[0:29:14] Kedemel: In my opinion, Cataclysm was awesome up until Dragon Soul. The world revamp was refreshing. Firelands is a top tier raid.
[0:29:25] wildwittra: looking forward to new tier-sets ? 12 small sigils = 12 classes.
[0:29:36] RaidBossMike: i still have wow installed since the dawn of age..... lol, havent uninstalled it yet
[0:29:38] mezza77: I feel there’s gonna be something big announced today
[0:29:39] flebbooo: True Kedemel!
[0:29:41] Thoreya: hopefully 9.2 is like 8.2
[0:29:43] Thoreya: 8.2 was lit af
[0:29:47] Red_Dead_Redeem: Legion was best expansion other than WOTLK for me
[0:29:51] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[0:29:54] CritcobainTV: 8.2
[0:30:05] baylokk: Omg that looks just like you
[0:30:09] Thoreya: that was the most content weve had in a patch since legion
[0:30:10] Kedemel: And at this point, if they really want to settle things down in the world, they should do another Azeroth revamp of sorts.
[0:30:11] cryzzer7: 8.2 was nice
[0:30:14] Sikkbass: @Serp91 Most streamers would've needed to jump ship somewhat to stay relevant in WoW's downfall and to not be perceived as "supporting" an organisation such as Blizz.  Was just that New World proved a good jump ship alternative and obviously has Amazon backing
[0:30:19] luckfore: yea 8.2 was very nice with 2 zones
[0:30:25] d2darkalliance: Cataclysm as expansion was a mess. Dungeons and raids great besides dragon soul
[0:30:30] Thoreya: essences were cool once you got over the fact it wasnt account wide and kept it moving
[0:30:33] CritcobainTV: There was very little i enjoyed about WoD at all
[0:30:41] CritcobainTV: err BFA
[0:30:44] CritcobainTV: sorry just woke up
[0:30:50] moonscryer: 9.2 announcement for 10secs followed by Ion running his lawyer-speak for 20mins. joy
[0:30:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: BFA was garbage
[0:31:01] baylokk: Um wait what is this?
[0:31:14] Thoreya: i miss freehold and kings rest
[0:31:16] RaidBossMike: hell i heard that GW2 tryin to make a comback, what yall think
[0:31:33] Kedemel: GW2 didn't go anywhere...
[0:31:35] d2darkalliance: Wod was much better then people made it. Because they hated garnison. But garnison made wow free2play :)
[0:31:38] baylokk: Are you actually gonna play WoW?
[0:31:41] Shrenko: @moonscryer LUL
[0:31:42] FireEmblemLord: I Love mists
[0:31:54] mezza77: @baylokk never stopped
[0:31:58] RaidBossMike: never said it did @Kedemel i just asked they are trying to make a comeback and opinions
[0:32:03] Shrenko: @ncroMike cmomback? the game is very much alive..
[0:32:21] RaidBossMike: i do agree @Shrenko
[0:32:27] RaidBossMike: stats says it all, not streams
[0:32:39] RaidBossMike: even though the streams just need more streamers
[0:32:42] Kedemel: I mean... Saying they are trying to make a comeback implies that they have to come back from somewhere, doesn't it?
[0:32:43] TheGaoSora: @d2darkalliance that was because the token was introduced during this era lol
[0:32:43] CritcobainTV: just cause people are playing doesn't mean it's in a good spot rn tho
[0:32:56] L4nds1ide: 9.2 will show new raid and they will be 0 raid testing on ptr
[0:33:01] RaidBossMike: Alot of folks talking about the new xpac coming soon though
[0:33:03] RaidBossMike: idk
[0:33:08] moonscryer: when the major entity in a given area takes a noesdive, lessers will take up the numbers, simple math. GW2 also has an expansion coming. Nothing earthshaking
[0:33:17] Sephirothxz: Towelliee playing wow POGGERS
[0:33:18] Kedemel: Yeah, they have a new expansion coming out so there's some excitement.
[0:33:19] RaidBossMike: and if amazon dont get their shit together and quick with LA coming soon...
[0:33:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: I haven't paid for a WoW sub since WOD and the announcement of the token LUL
[0:33:28] d2darkalliance: @theomnisora yes, due to that garnison payed for sub :)
[0:33:31] RaidBossMike: i believe lost ark is gonna win alot of people over
[0:33:40] Thoreya: i thought i was gonna like lost ark
[0:33:40] MoxasTV: true
[0:33:41] Thoreya: just not for me
[0:33:44] RaidBossMike: imo anyways

[0:33:48] TheGaoSora: @d2darkalliance that's what i meant lol
[0:33:52] Kedemel: Lost Ark scratches a different itch.
[0:33:58] Thoreya: i played the beta and wwanted to like it so bad..but just not for me
[0:34:08] TheGaoSora: man tokens were a mistake...
[0:34:08] RaidBossMike: no? @Thoreya :(
[0:34:09] Sephirothxz: Long live the king
[0:34:10] SlackerFromDK: i did return to wow for a week ago :D playing in eu
[0:34:13] d2darkalliance: Lost ark is good. But not that good it win many players.
[0:34:23] RaidBossMike: ^
[0:34:29] baylokk: whats goin on are we waiting for the stream to start?
[0:34:34] Red_Dead_Redeem: Lost Ark is not bad, but yeah it's hit different for me
[0:34:48] RaidBossMike: man still poopin @baylokk so let him poop
[0:34:52] Red_Dead_Redeem: scratches a different itch

[0:35:46] RaidBossMike: never seen too many mmoARPGs around
[0:35:47] d2darkalliance: I like it too. But it Will have though time. Like most games have to compete
[0:35:48] baylokk: like
[0:36:03] RaidBossMike: 2 in 1
[0:36:07] RaidBossMike: or 2 for 1
[0:36:11] Red_Dead_Redeem: All aboard the Towel tran!!!!
[0:36:15] Red_Dead_Redeem: *train
[0:36:21] Thunderbrew: !soon
[0:36:22] Moobot: @Thunderbrew it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 36:30 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon™
[0:36:27] RaidBossMike: i like the hammer squad better @Red_Dead_Redeem
[0:36:34] baylokk: Does lost arc end at midnight today?
[0:36:43] Shrenko: is the twitch audio bar bugged for anyone else?
[0:36:44] RaidBossMike: idk about all that towel train business
[0:36:49] Red_Dead_Redeem: @ncroMike Hammer Squad is much better

[1:11:27] wildwittra: 3 large sigils in the 9.2-teaser. (Tank, Healer, DPS ?)
[1:11:28] BaldBroGaming: I feel like they would push cross faction as a "expansion feature" for 10 and act like it was their idea the whole time
[1:11:32] Red_Dead_Redeem: "during these challenging times" OMEGALUL
[1:11:33] TheUnknowing: 100% needs to be in raids though, cause thats the main thing, not really an issue with m+

[1:12:06] cappei: I want cross-faction to happen for the sole reason that it'd prevent them from doing any more dogshit faction war expansions. Forever. That shit is so overdone
[1:12:08] Collected1: its too big a feature to not have as part of an expantion
[1:12:12] Collected1: expansion
[1:12:13] Sicknessqt: @Xoomie81  how many times are you gonna write that DansGame

[2:32:11] dutchie76: wth
[2:32:12] Ohdies: We would have less of a need for classic relaunches if they would just scale up the older content. Even if they don’t want to balance old gear. I think people would gladly do old raid at retail difficulty for fun + transmog

[2:46:06] j_bar111: rares and daily quests
[2:46:10] stubbedub: 25 % from world boss
[2:46:11] Warblade23: rares + dalies + worldboss
[2:46:11] HaloS23: @GFiTV SOO was about as bad too
[2:46:11] evercl3armkii: you can look at the conduit on the side to see the regular values
[2:46:13] theoriginalzinng: the daily quests
[2:46:13] KaisenSiru: Dailies give like 7% each
[2:46:13] Pannekaker: @Towelliee Maw world boss is also 25%
[2:46:16] eakiller: korthia rares and treasures

[2:46:34] Balkep: 1. Cut a hole in the box
[2:46:35] wildwittra: dailies and rares in Korthia is enough
[2:46:36] GFiTV: @HaloS23 in terms of player numbers and staleness? no. in terms of draught? yes.
[2:46:38] mmo_kenna_: Toxic game, I'm pissed because I used to love it

[2:47:26] j_bar111: Max said if you are playing it willbe nice but not enough to bring people back for the most part
[2:47:30] BoiAtomico: @Morpserie Stands for sarcasm. They can't produce quality content anymore and people who play, play it ouf ot habit not because of liking of the game lol. Downhill since BfA, sadly
[2:47:36] ender_casanova: yeah but why man, why did they took forever to do this??
[2:47:36] GFiTV: Pulling the ripcord aint gonna save shadowlands Kappa
[2:47:37] Balkep: should've done it before launch
[2:47:40] Pallananana: Yoinked it like a god damn mowing machine
[2:47:44] HaloS23: @GFiTV on that point i agree. i dunno just feel the game has too much history and investment from players and devs alike to die like this
[2:47:45] garyoldmann: Sup Towel hope all is well
[2:47:57] Vigi9413: They might yank the Arthas ripcord next
[2:47:59] ZealotryTV: its not that good for people who are behind on their mains though. its good for alts though
[2:48:05] j_bar111: BTW world boss gives pretty good % too

[2:48:11] theawesomestshow: jus wish they would fix pvp where its burst or be bursted everythigns 1 shot
[2:48:11] MezzanineZ: the issue with 9.1.5 is delayed legion timewalking and limiting it to 2 weeks
[2:48:20] Morpserie: @TheAtomicRam oh lmao, to be fair i do agree with you, i still do like WoW but the development path has suffered a lot so i guess i'm on copium for this announcement of 9.2 LUL
[2:48:25] GFiTV: @HaloS23 I agree, it aint gonna fall over and die. to much investment, atleast from me. But it needs to change, a lot!, for me to be interested in returning
[2:48:31] UltimaWeap: yeah

[2:48:43] j_bar111: I thought it was going back to once a week after the first time
[2:48:47] CrusaderNero: riding the cock Kreygasm
[2:48:52] wildwittra: NEW probable feature for 9.2 is ability to post picture directly to Instagram besides Twitter
[2:48:54] Rebemma: I am sure they will change something about TW
[2:48:55] Rabbi19: i dont understand why timewalking isnt just another aspect of the game. LIke always available
[2:48:56] Buttscratchrr: They do every possible to get players to quit.... luxthoTurkey
[2:48:57] j_bar111: sorry one week
[2:49:00] Warblade23: They should make it 4 times a year
[2:49:01] mavericks312: im just hoping for some dope looking tier sets in 9.2
[2:49:06] flebbooo: yeah idk why they don't make timewalking more frequent, its such an easy win for them

[2:49:18] Vigi9413: dude that fel werebear though
[2:49:18] StraightErro: @j_bar111 it's still several months between legion timewalking rotations
[2:49:29] cptrogers123: PLSS  JUST BRING OUT FUCKING NEW CONTENT
[2:49:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: That Legion timewalking bear skin is really good looking
[2:49:31] Kelmor: you only need lvl2 to farm?
[2:49:33] Ertra: @shepk1n 10pst
[2:49:35] baaronthemonk: They should just have it all the time, why not?
[2:49:36] Slinttu: @shepk1n in 3.5 hours
[2:49:36] GFiTV: @Rabbi19 FF14 says hey. but yes. 100% agree. Timewalking should just be mixed with chromietime (and be an always active side system)
[2:49:40] Carahail: I thought legion wasn't till the 7th
[2:49:42] HaloS23: @GFiTV agreed
[2:49:42] j_bar111: @j_bar111 I meant to say its only going to last 1 week and go into normal rotaion
[2:49:43] rhodeos_: dec first I get to see my son via ultrasound :D , but agreed legion time walking should be available more often considering they promoted the f out of it
[2:49:45] flazy_2595: are they letting you get the original mage tower tmogs? or is it just the bear for druids?
[2:49:54] Frinon: they should rework the timewalking system
[2:49:56] Akitor123: legion timewalking is 7/8th
[2:49:57] Drizz_36: all timewalking should always been up, it's silly that it's on a rotation with so many expansions
[2:49:58] szble: did you buy the cat mount
[2:50:03] Carahail: rip
[2:50:04] manmower: 9.2 for christmas
[2:50:04] Kromede: let's hope it will something new
[2:50:07] Jarlan23: oh man i hope i can spend a couple months farming new sockets in 9.2
[2:50:07] BoiAtomico: @Morpserie I'm speaking out of experience as well, I like WoW and wanted them to succeed, but got fed up with being served shit and paying for it and having to say thank you with a smile on my face. Quit, had a relapse, manage to quit again and figured that my WoW vice was out of habit of playing it daily and not because it was actually good and brought me enjoyment
[2:50:10] Vigi9413: idk if I'm ready to bash my head against the tank Mage Tower again
[2:50:11] EpicSieni: they should just let people scale down to older content always, no need to make it an event every now and then
[2:50:18] abbosss: thinking 9.2 will be this year COPIUM
[2:50:21] Xailen: 12.1.5 "timewalking now open to all expansions every other week"
[2:50:23] Screamnsteam: the Announcement is the merge of Square Enix and Blizzard Kappa
[2:50:24] NuAera: korthia is op now, so much research
[2:50:25] StraightErro: getting research to level conduits
[2:50:26] smashwow: to be fair it should just be available all the time. you don't have to wait in other games for that same type of content. SWTOR and FF14 both keep old content relevant.
[2:50:26] imagine6917: gold farmer korthia

[3:31:30] ashwing_: The callings give renown
[3:31:35] magemaster225: I think you still have to do the anima quest and the korthia weekly but other than that you can farm up to max
[3:31:39] Bowjangels: Don’t have to do campaign anymore for 80
[3:31:57] zeitgeiz: My alt was 73 renown when I hit 60. Was 80 the next day
[3:32:02] lumaday: save your weeklies for last few renown
[3:32:02] TheLoho: @Towelliee Torghast spam is a great way to farm renown
[3:32:03] theoriginalzinng: time for some mindless speed runs of torghast 9
[3:32:06] Carahail: torgast gives it.. can farm it all out in a day
[3:32:07] balancedlight: @Towelliee what server are you on?
[3:32:15] SuubzTV: think thorghast layer 9 is the best grind for renown
[3:32:19] Kisswani: man the Draka and Thrall moments in the Korthia campaing got me BibleThump
[3:32:27] theoriginalzinng: yeah but you can speed run them in like 5 minutes

[3:33:22] wednesjae: 100% will have him
[3:33:27] Rytten: The Jailer is Sargeras soul
[3:33:28] Taz_85: Turns out the Jailer got his soul stolen by an even bigger Jailer! To explain his evilness
[3:33:32] Drizz_36: you just do the korthia campaign, it unlocks pretty quickly
[3:33:33] Khromgar: Jailer destroys the whole world and somehow we open a portal to entirely new universe and migrate there
[3:33:34] Rexialiton: oh yeah
[3:33:35] MexicanMisker: main thing im looking forward to from the announcement is that 9.2 is the last patch and that 10.0 is next :)
[3:33:36] Bowjangels: How insane are the 262 lego piece costs on your server? Most over 100k now on Kael’thas
[3:33:39] Tastus: @Towelliee  dont lie...you know what will be in the next xpac

[3:35:13] legionph2: BALDVAR u mean
[3:35:13] MexicanMisker: would you say WoW is like Walmart and other rising MMOs are like Amazon/more with the times?
[3:35:14] flebbooo: Yeah Blovar was done big time dirty
[3:35:14] Gooseberries: Yeah he was way more BA when human
[3:35:18] KonradGM: i was hyped for bolvar
[3:35:19] UltimaWeap: pour one out
[3:35:19] Taz_85: @Zivs Ah that's cool, thanks!
[3:35:20] KonradGM: :(
[3:35:25] Gooseberries: Put on the crown and became limp
[3:35:28] CritcobainTV: Bolvar makes me almost as sad as Malfurion in Legion. TYRANDE WHERE ARE YOOOOOOOOU
[3:35:29] KingSpud91: If Arthas doesnt show up in some shape or form in shadowlands i riot
[3:35:34] Xinthas: Bolvar is just salty he had to sit on that throne and be quiet.
[3:35:41] Rytten: where is Varian
[3:35:43] Khromgar: Siege of Stormwind incoming
[3:35:44] Kinghorn: towBolvar cobaltSac feenSuper
[3:35:48] Cooky_28: Hey @Towelliee is there something new lore on 9.1.5? I can't play this time sadly and I want to know .
[3:35:57] idenkaz_: redeem? for what KEKW
[3:35:59] Jsibs: SPOILER ALERT
[3:36:01] Taz_85: He was bad ass in the cinematic, even though he got beat...but as soon as he showed up in-game as a helpful npc, horrible
[3:36:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe bolvar and arthas will have a lich off competition Kappa
[3:36:04] Bowjangels: WoW does love a good redemption story…..
[3:36:10] Maxoru0: Bolvar got weak from sitting for so long
[3:36:14] Aidler: @tauxwyell for 10 month straight swiftyHappy
[3:36:23] DuploThief: i want to see arthas in 9.2 or riot because i have been waiting for him since afterlives @Towelliee
[3:36:24] sirbilliam1732: i just read an article suggesting that the 'enimies" in new world were winning the game, on low pop servers they can not keep up with the invasions and everything are being downgrading, making it so the enemies are actually rully the world.
[3:36:26] tonygzS: he has a chance COPIUM
[3:36:26] luckfore: arena yrel?
[3:36:29] mmrghost7: kahdgar and illdan are running a bar

[3:36:42] kharditv: one word Turalyon
[3:36:53] Khromgar: @Aidler 10 in the best scenario prob 1y and 2 or so kekw
[3:36:55] Tecni: Khadgar is in Oribos
[3:37:11] Tecni: You can see his raven flying in the portal room
[3:37:15] Bowjangels: LFR is harder than heroic to actual get the kills lol
[3:37:27] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:37:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe it
[3:37:32] Rytten: cmon dude bolvar was stuck in the throne all day listening to random noises with his helm ofcourse he would be weakened
[3:37:44] Kinghorn: I side with the enemy
[3:37:46] Xailen: I dont see blizz doing anything good with know characters anymore, they will make them useless and bring in super boring new ones that are super op
[3:37:46] balancedlight: @Towelliee Isnt Dalaran gonna go back to where it used to be in Hillsbarad foothills
[3:37:52] mmo_kenna_: LFR should be chill, Ion wants every WoW player to be a fucking Esport star
[3:37:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: that immovable bug sounds awful lol solution = delete character
[3:38:09] KingofMeccano: khadgar is gonna appear as ghost when he gets killed by something he should of summoned and say "oh yeah hi, i may of done a bad thing"
[3:38:09] Taz_85: That fan theory of Turalyon taking the throne and becoming a dictator paladin was pretty cool. Setting the Light up as an actual villain is interesting
[3:38:26] KingofMeccano: *shouldnt
[3:38:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: look at kungens twitter
[3:38:32] Xinthas: wait, this raid has those torghast upgrades? I never actually played 9.1
[3:38:42] MortiousPrime: @Taz_85 A la the Mag'har scenario? That'd be dope
[3:38:45] KingZarth: only thing I miss about this game is my old guild.
[3:38:46] Shrenko: @Xinthas only first boss
[3:38:46] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:39:01] PhoazXD: No interest in TBC anymore ?
[3:39:06] Kisswani: monkaS he's gonna kill the warlocks in the slaghtered lambs inn
[3:39:08] Xinthas: @Shrenko Oh ok :D
[3:39:16] Taz_85: @MortiousPrime Yeah, for sure. Light-corrupt Turalyon AND fanatic Yrel to deal with
[3:39:20] NewWorldReign: Who is Anduins second in command anyway?
[3:39:26] dopieGG: TOWELIE, OUR KING
[3:39:34] flebbooo: Excuse me sir, ever heard of the light?
[3:39:34] AetherMana: Another theory is that we could see what happens to illidan if the light corrupts
[3:39:41] Bowjangels: I am curious how the explain that the scourge haven’t taken over Azeroth and who will lead the undead
[3:39:45] kabam11: Is the 9.2 stuff in 40 min?
[3:39:51] Rytten: As far as I know Blizz as soon as anyone gets a theory right they dismiss and throw away any plan they had so they get "unpredictable"
[3:39:52] tonygzS: why cant i be king
[3:39:56] Deathkanigit101: i think arthus sister will take over for anduin
[3:39:57] MOLAR305: @flebbomate Turalyon i would assume
[3:39:58] AJPro: 2h 40min
[3:39:58] jiinxest: Towelie, i'm feeling a wow craving after none of the other MMO's scratched my itch right. How are you feeling about it right now? Worth coming back?
[3:39:59] Bowjangels: 10pst I think
[3:40:15] tankatrono_o: Just a quick question, how much time left until 9.2 announcement?
[3:40:19] MysticRaven_: ngl even tho i currently main paly im starting to hate the light
[3:40:24] nerdtopia: cross faction m+ would be sick
[3:40:27] xrandomdoodx: 2 legendaries for 9.2 would be PogChamp
[3:40:28] dopieGG: @Towelliee confirmed we are getting a pre-made video. not a stream.
[3:40:29] Molvonos: I know Sollice wants to go back to Alliance.  The dirty heathen.
[3:40:31] N3llee: @Towelliee see the bingo card for today?
[3:40:33] szble: cross faction please god
[3:40:33] NuAera: tier sets shown off
[3:40:34] Rexialiton: @tyrannius_ begins 10 am pst
[3:40:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: @tyrannius_ about 2 and a half hours
[3:40:36] flebbooo: @MOLAR305 yeah LUL i hope Turalyon goes crazy
[3:40:36] nerdtopia: could spice up MDI with cool new faction comps
[3:40:40] HexaDroid: @jiinxest stay away from the copium :-)
[3:40:43] wickedmgg: ion said if that would be a new xpac before they tried
[3:40:48] tankatrono_o: Great thanks al:)
[3:40:49] luckfore: 100% going back to alliance if they add it
[3:40:49] Xailen: I expect nothing and will still be disappointed
[3:40:50] Arroneous: They would need something big
[3:40:51] tankatrono_o: all*
[3:40:55] Bowjangels: @jiinxest I just came back after 7 years and having fun. A lot of systems but game is still fun at its core
[3:40:57] Khromgar: Factions are pointless at this stage of the lore
[3:41:01] manmower: Mythic+ Timewalking
[3:41:07] ChaoticPriest: Does the music ever disappoint you? I usually enjoy it thoroughly. If it's one constant that Bliz has--its music and cinematics @Towelliee
[3:41:13] SilverMyr13: just get rid of the alliance
[3:41:14] Molvonos: Two factions has been pointless for three expansions at the very least.
[3:41:16] reinhardtdog: reinhardtdog subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 49 months, currently on a 49 month streak! towHAMUP towBleedpurple towHAMUP towBleedpurple  towHAMUP towBleedpurple  towHAMUP towBleedpurple  towHAMUP towBleedpurple  towHAMUP towBleedpurple
[3:41:16] Kisswani: I am in favor of making you able to group up with your Bnet friends . allow raiding with friends regardless of faction
[3:41:19] AJPro: Sepulcher Raid for sure
[3:41:21] Parkway1088: These streamers that swore off wow, now that New World is dying. Came right back to wow. Wow is eternal
[3:41:21] KingSlayerYotam: they should start at m+
[3:41:23] SilkeySmooth: i cant progress in m+ because i dont have a phone
[3:41:24] Beet4: Yeah factions are so dated, hope they get rid of them all together. The game would be much better
[3:41:29] FrozenShades: Factions have been pointless for years now.
[3:41:30] Groovyjoe: remove factions pls
[3:41:30] jackymoon: i feel all instance dungeons pvp and raiding should be cross faction in the lfg system
[3:41:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: lets drop a mana bomb on stormwind Kappa
[3:41:31] Bowjangels: Factions can still be separate for BGs. Makes sense the skirmish against each other
[3:41:31] Arroneous: New race/class combos
[3:41:33] Rytten: I want 4th spec
[3:41:33] mavericks312: i mean tbf the faction war is pretty much dead at this point in the game
[3:41:35] Rexialiton: I was just about to type that lol
[3:41:36] Mahal_11532: Would love cross faction guild, but without it and it just being M+ would see minimal impact cause I only do M+ in-guild for the sake of my sanity
[3:41:42] nerdtopia: i dont think cross faction everywhere will ever exist because that just straight up counteracts the lore right? @Towelliee
[3:41:42] maccaruso: What is going on here?  Am I in the right channel?
[3:41:45] smobeatz: in how many hours is the announcemetn ?
[3:41:45] jackymoon: i also feel any race can join any faction
[3:41:49] Khromgar: interesting idea would be making the factions more like the covenants
[3:41:51] savjzbeastz0n: id rather not play shadowlands at all, not worth giving them money after all the fuckups they did. better to just wait new expansion
[3:41:52] Eviltuna13: Gnomes and Goblins working together sacS
[3:41:56] galdrelvolkfire: Just got here, what do you mean about cross faction?
[3:41:58] Rabbi19: would love to see it in pvp as well
[3:42:06] Alacod: cross faction has all the benefits and no negatives
[3:42:08] MOLAR305: no one ever leaves wow
[3:42:09] flebbooo: Only person to ever swear of wow was Totalbiscuit LUL
[3:42:10] Arroneous: @towelliee you play lost ark beta?
[3:42:13] wickedmgg: but preach did sayt that did he not?
[3:42:13] jeizor: This is wow 101, content gets meh, people leave, new patch, people return. Its the cycle of wow :D
[3:42:14] NewWorldReign: Looking forward to Elden Ring?
[3:42:19] FrozenShades: @flebbomate Too soon :(
[3:42:23] SilkeySmooth: like bellular saying im done with wow but still plays it...lol
[3:42:27] Parkway1088: 'I'm never playing wow again" how do you misinterpret that? lmao. Love you Towelliee, glad you are back.
[3:42:28] Shrenko: @aeroneous_15 he did the whole week :P
[3:42:29] mavericks312: elden ring is gonna be so good
[3:42:31] Zivs: @aeroneous_15 he played it pretty muach every day it was open except today
[3:42:35] Khromgar: WOW once in never out
[3:42:42] NuAera: not supporting current state and quitting are very different
[3:42:44] DallTV_: eeew belluar
[3:42:45] jackymoon: most will continue the raid
[3:42:47] Arroneous: Oh dope. Been busy haven’t be watching the stream
[3:42:48] rustyjeep: come on over to SoM and play some hardcore
[3:42:50] savjzbeastz0n: @mavericks312 single player tho
[3:42:51] flebbooo: @FrozenShades sorry, he will always be missed <3
[3:42:57] N3llee: cause your sick of the game and the same bullshit systems?
[3:43:03] Athinzi: @wickedmgg No, he said he wasn't playing unless something changed to make him want to play.
[3:43:03] MistaHat: did Shade discband? @Towelliee
[3:43:03] jackymoon: but shadowlands has been a huge gold sync for many players and thats a big problem
[3:43:03] theoriginalzinng: if its more of the same crap systems i dont know if i want to come back lol
[3:43:05] jeizor: @DallDK He is ok, but his recent content is just facepalm honestly.
[3:43:06] nerdtopia: the temptation to come back is always there
[3:43:07] REALABeastAmI: REALABeastAmI subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 72 months! 72 years! I just murdered my right heel, when I tried to readjust. Rolled it hard into my self ouch hehe pity party!
[3:43:11] Zivs: they have an iron mode implemented
[3:43:12] CardinalTX: Holly Longdale will take WoW the way of Everquest. Re-release from classic with different rule sets
[3:43:14] SilkeySmooth: season of alliance mastery?...lol
[3:43:15] undisputedmoe: Wow is the best mmo period
[3:43:17] BIGxTPx23: yeah idk if I will come back for 9.2 just becuase I am enjoying so many other games, but next expansion no doubt I am back in lol
[3:43:18] rustyjeep: dropped a hardcore buff for us, continuing to be player based however
[3:43:18] nerdtopia: i dont think cross faction everywhere will ever exist because that just straight up counteracts the lore right? @Towelliee
[3:43:19] mavericks312: @savjzbeastz0n what your point? single player games outside of mmo's are still the best
[3:43:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: there is a community hardcore league happening to kill ragnaros without dieing
[3:43:21] Jsibs: it  has a hardcore mode in game
[3:43:24] wickedmgg: @jackymoon Gottcha
[3:43:25] undisputedmoe: I don’t care what anyone says
[3:43:27] ayohammie: i skip WoD expansion to play ff14
[3:43:31] mynameisjonas79: ONE company i swore off was CCP. they screwed up DUST 514 and EVE Online...
[3:43:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there looks to be real support for hardcore ironman in SoM
[3:43:32] lilch4p0: its a buff soul of iron
[3:43:33] undisputedmoe: They will never make any game like wow
[3:43:34] MrKhanes: You can play a hardcore mode in SoM if you want
[3:43:37] FrozenShades: I miss my Monk from WoW, Have taken a break since January :(
[3:43:40] Zivs: yea
[3:43:42] luckfore: its a toggle from a npc
[3:43:46] Jsibs: its a buff from a npc
[3:43:47] Kinghorn: NPC you talk to in IF/UC
[3:43:47] Shrenko: you have to talk with a guy to toggle it
[3:43:48] magemaster225: yeah every time yu die you lose 1% to stats every permanently
[3:43:51] KaisenSiru: Yeah and some achievement if you do Ragnaros Ironman
[3:43:53] Molvonos: Prolly doesnt work on pvp.
[3:43:54] rustyjeep: it wont work PVP.  everyone dies.
[3:43:55] Zivs: on a pvp server you die KEKW
[3:43:55] Aidler: preach only spoke about his main YT channel quitting WoW. he personally will of course come back to WoW
[3:43:56] SilkeySmooth: if you make it to 60 you dont delete your hr
[3:43:57] Shrenko: you dont do it on a pvp server KEKW
[3:44:01] tastytictacs: @undisputedmoe even with all it's bugs, in terms of polish... It's undisputed as well, imo
[3:44:24] Exodeo_: An actual Wow stream? what is this madness?
[3:44:31] DrBrumm: nope ^^
[3:44:35] Stangin2122: Its a buff..doesnt really matter though right?  If you die you get a debuff go to a capitol and pay to have the other buff reinstated
[3:44:45] rustyjeep: imagine trying to do a Ragnaros run with hardcore gear and never having died up to that point.  Image
[3:44:45] undisputedmoe: Literally the best story of all time plus the game itself so unique and epic
[3:44:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: if 10.0 makes some major changes and a new class i will probably come back
[3:44:49] rustyjeep: *Imagine
[3:44:49] godpwer: so clean
[3:44:59] grapyz: chess
[3:45:01] Kinghorn: other wow streamers >_>

[3:45:17] honkblarg: EFT streamers
[3:45:18] Dorianss: This is a Raid?
[3:45:20] bloodgulch_survivor: just waiting for the next expansion so I can max another alt with a token then unsub. Again.
[3:45:21] Arroneous: Need something worth coming back for this expansion
[3:45:21] Rexialiton: Cdew <3
[3:45:21] shaxioz2852: FF / forza 5
[3:45:33] Sielu11628: Copian day!
[3:45:35] luckfore: amourath
[3:45:36] VrtniPatuljak: WoG18 too real LUL
[3:45:37] Khromgar: League of Legends kekw
[3:45:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol hot tub streams
[3:45:44] Sielu11628: Copium*
[3:45:44] blazyturtle: PepeLaugh no way
[3:45:45] nerdtopia: grinding poe
[3:45:45] MistaHat: @Towelliee did Shade stop raiding?
[3:45:46] FrozenShades: @Tauxwyell Puke lmao
[3:45:47] mavericks312: you say that lol
[3:46:01] TheUnknowing: Ive just been watching this cuban dude play tons of different games
[3:46:03] REALABeastAmI: BDO, Pathfinder, NBA 2k, ESO and so on
[3:46:07] Arroneous: So bummed lost ark closing till like Jan or feb
[3:46:15] jeizor: playing other games just makes me miss how good Wow is, ngl
[3:46:17] Gooseberries: Are they shaved?
[3:46:17] chavodk: TRUE
[3:46:22] theNebuchadnezzar: yeah man those pll anit worth your time
[3:46:25] KaisenSiru: YEP
[3:46:28] Fromuck: Agree
[3:46:28] Gooseberries: Or am I gonna need to floss?
[3:46:30] CoolStoryDaniel: based
[3:46:34] Buckwink: wtf lol people like that are so cringe
[3:46:39] gnaril84: And that is why the 'community' is cancer AF
[3:46:40] VrtniPatuljak: towelliee I prefer variety, sub sunday was the best
[3:46:42] Exodeo_: No one gets to decide what games people play
[3:46:43] Beet4: Yeah you are right, WoW has to much history just to ignore. It's the rooted deep into many of our hearts
[3:46:44] nerdtopia: how many hours till the announcement?
[3:46:45] flebbooo: yeah those are the absoulute worst people
[3:46:45] evercl3armkii: toxic ppl being toxic
[3:46:48] NexusOps: some people's logic is like ... wtf are you on? rooDerp
[3:47:01] Molvonos: @NexusOps Correction: There's no logic involved.
[3:47:06] AlexCzz93: If anything it shows you what the game to be better by leaving imo
[3:47:10] Shrenko: wow is very toxic compared to other mmos
[3:47:12] KaisenSiru: Insufferable
[3:47:25] agrippa66: gate keeping about something no one cares about besides gate keepers themselves
[3:47:30] BoiAtomico: No @Towelliee not everyone will go back to WoW just because there's a new patch or expac, because not everyone's on the copium wagon with the "It's new, it must be good", since it's the same people, doing the same game, making the same promises. We're in this loop for 2 expacs now. Just because they call it gourmet, if it comes out of the ass, it's shit none the less
[3:47:31] Rexialiton: People think its not okay to take a break from a game lol
[3:47:31] REALABeastAmI: Asmundgold BDO whale video is gold @towelliee
[3:47:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: doh
[3:47:32] teodor4o: lol
[3:47:44] Nightshaft25: Hey its 9.2 good? COPIUM!
[3:47:45] Molvonos: Warlock thought he had the 99% aoe damage redux.
[3:47:45] luckfore: ppl afk
[3:47:54] NexusOps: @Molvonos yea, sometimes people have no filter whatsoever. They spew random words with no thought behind them
[3:47:57] deeebag: no ppl are just bad now lol
[3:48:05] eephuslive: good to see ya back playin wow for a bit towelie <3
[3:48:12] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee why are you playing WOW did I miss something :o
[3:48:13] RRspud: People still die in LFR this late in the game?
[3:48:14] heyyosup123: @Towelliee  how long for 9.2 announcement?
[3:48:15] theoriginalzinng: no just only the average quality of the playerbase has gone down
[3:48:26] mavericks312: and not even the good FF game
[3:48:27] mmrghost7: all the good players went to poe :
[3:48:35] RunningOutOfRAM: @chat can some one tell me why does he plays WOW ?

[3:48:59] dopieGG: @Tastus what a solid & heartfelt take. lmao.
[3:49:06] RunningOutOfRAM: @bingo5555 oh what hour I forgot about it
[3:49:08] GiottoGG: ten of towers lol
[3:49:11] GhostShaman: @Towelliee  are you back to wow? Ive missed a few weeks T_T
[3:49:31] flebbooo: I did an hour heroic pug yesterday and i swear like 5-7 people picked the stun affix KEKW

[3:49:55] Tastus: i mean am i wrong?
[3:50:18] Meliea_EU: see i dont come back, because i play wow every day and dont leave
[3:50:20] PToastman: "not everyone"
[3:50:24] mavericks312: wow is on a decade high sales ride for a reason
[3:50:24] Buckwink: 9.1 was probably the worst patch not in WoD and tons of people came back
[3:50:27] flebbooo: facts
[3:50:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: They always came back before, yeah
[3:50:32] Molvonos: @Tastus Yes.  Absolutely and completely.  But you likely wont ever believe that.
[3:50:34] Kisswani: People keep tlking like there's no good things in WoW
[3:50:37] SteveSD: blizz is woke, go broke
[3:50:39] Thoreya: 9.2 is gonna be lit and everyone crying is gonna be in a tough posiiton
[3:50:40] GhostShaman: lol you know how many times Ive quit this game over the past 18 years?? 🤣
[3:50:48] N3llee: @Towelliee Have you seen the New World server bug with called "Utopia" every mob on the server bugged, nothing attacking players, free elite chest roaming/farming
[3:50:54] nerdtopia: some people give up on the xpac if the first patch is trash
[3:50:56] CardinalTX: Never!     As im playing Everquest right now watching a WoW stream
[3:50:58] Buckwink: 9.2 wont live up to 8.2 but I hope its at least fun af
[3:50:58] Lovesomeppl: there's nothing lit in a update with a repeating system
[3:50:59] Arroneous: The problem is no one at the top cares about wow. They rather do same old stuff and not listen to what players want
[3:51:00] NewWorldReign: Do you think Blizzard are going places after what happened all those months ago? @Towelliee
[3:51:01] Cloudemon: why do people care about what other people do so much
[3:51:02] Tastus: how? explain?
[3:51:03] BoiAtomico: The days of WoW are numbered if they don't remake the team. Ion's an incompetent prick who can't lead the game nowhere, the writting team is a disaster and there are plenty of other games, cheaper or free, with cheaper or no subs at all, that provide better game and enjoyment that what the devs team for WoW can provide @Towelliee the market is better now, WoW is an habit for most people now, not a pleasure or an enjoyment, sadly
[3:51:15] DHedbor: no he doesn't eat the powers in LFR
[3:51:17] sanguinenuti: It’s gonna bring people back to clear the raid and then soon as that’s e will be back to quitting again
[3:51:20] onedarkman: not  returning  have fun
[3:51:22] SteveSD: let this game die with honor
[3:51:25] Meliea_EU: wow is still the best western mmo, NW is just a hollow shell
[3:51:25] BoiAtomico: And I'm not hating on WoW, it saddens me to hell that the game is in this state after spending many years on it
[3:51:35] N3llee: @Towelliee Seen the bugged Utopia server in new world? It just started happening.
[3:51:35] Phantomstrk: people who left because of content drought will come back, and out of the people who left because of morality issues, only a small fraction of those will never ever come back, but the vast majority will come back.
[3:51:40] Forceof8: I'm honestly more excited for Endwalker than anything WoW dropped since cataclysm lol
[3:51:41] grapyz: wait he doesnt go super sayan mode in lfr?
[3:51:44] Kisswani: Not hating on WoW , sure buddy
[3:51:48] tdpark_: renown LULW

[3:52:01] Dewulfi: wow addicts always come back
[3:52:02] bakurathewolf: do M+0 at @Towelliee  to get it
[3:52:08] dutrockbridge: @Towelliee I think the higher renown you are, the harder content required for consistent gains
[3:52:22] grapyz: it just got a bit repetive, I'll prob be back in 9.2
[3:52:27] LifeAggroGaming: layer 9 torghast is the best renowned farm you missed comp stomp renowned farm last week though
[3:52:28] Arroneous: Need more content that actually is good
[3:52:28] SilkeySmooth: 9.2 last patch and .5 the pre patch?
[3:52:32] GhostShaman: Im tired of the constant gating...I want that to change.
[3:52:33] Shrenko: Im gonna miss variety Towel towCry
[3:52:39] Kinghorn: LFR hero PogChamp
[3:52:46] N3llee: @Shrenko same
[3:52:48] NewWorldReign: You can get renown from PvP now @Towelliee
[3:52:50] AnthMann: Hey @towelliee have you quit new world? Apparently I been seeing late game content bad and boring. Should I get it?? @towelliee
[3:52:52] lumaday: so many games right now
[3:52:55] chulklol: u still have new world tank guide ? @Towelliee
[3:53:02] AlexCzz93: so much room for activities now
[3:53:07] Buttscratchrr: so much better to play other games not just sticking to 1
[3:53:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think PvP farming for renown is better now, yeah
[3:53:12] sanguinenuti: And halo is coming out
[3:53:17] RunningOutOfRAM: KEKW
[3:53:19] ArctyxZ: ArctyxZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[3:53:22] Aidler: leave mythic to the RWF guys
[3:53:22] Nafalyno: IF 9.2  seems good tonight ill will go play again xD:P
[3:53:24] SteveSD: tanking is amazing in new world
[3:53:35] BoiAtomico: If the content is not good and consistently keeps on not being good, people will stop believing in your product and find that content elsewhere, where there's better and cheaper options, and the market right now is crazy. Blizzard needs to take a stand and really redesign the way the game is going, and Ion is too thick to be able to change is way
[3:53:38] Thoreya: torghast is the best to farm renown
[3:53:41] whtrabbitt: you mean you dont like holding up block 50% of the time?
[3:53:41] chulklol: with life staff ( paladin  ) ya
[3:53:45] Kromede: the peoples DPS towPog
[3:53:45] nerdtopia: random bgs are so aids
[3:53:47] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee you spam layer 9 torgast for Renown to level 80 :)
[3:53:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think regular BG's have a good chance at giving a renown now
[3:53:53] Beet4: Are they announcing 9.2 tonight?
[3:53:53] dutrockbridge: I saw people speedrunning Torghast for renown
[3:53:57] Nafalyno: I only don't like they made a mess with profession
[3:53:59] SilkeySmooth: even i came back to 9.1.5 to catch up for 9.2
[3:53:59] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee trust me :) renow farm is in torgast :)
[3:54:01] darkh79: not a lot of people pay that close attention
[3:54:03] Thoreya: people wouldve still played the game if it was good even with the blizzard stuff
[3:54:08] GhostShaman: I dont give a shit. I care about the game design improving.
[3:54:10] Arroneous: Is announced 10am or 10pm lol
[3:54:13] Thoreya: it was just a cop out
[3:54:18] Rexialiton: @aeroneous_15 am
[3:54:21] Frutzgar: I'm at the point where I don't know what Blizzard needs to do to get me back
[3:54:21] Phantomstrk: i mean our small group stopped because of the issues and the content being bad, but if 9.2 seems good we will be back, and to make things fresh i'm gonna try tanking, which i have never done, to try and see the game from a different angle
[3:54:22] Kelticlore: you mean reddit isnt god
[3:54:28] dopieGG: the stock price definitely reflected from their delays
[3:54:28] Arroneous: Thank god
[3:54:31] Buckwink: its like watching the news, it just makes you depressed
[3:54:34] Draygore333: people still buying nike
[3:54:37] evercl3armkii: yep
[3:54:38] UlsterFarl: I'm going to play 9.2 finish the store and that will be me again.  Can't be arsed with running the gear treadmill any more.
[3:54:42] Arroneous: Blizzard needs to get away from activision
[3:54:44] Rexialiton: @aeroneous_15 so in about 1.5 hours
[3:54:47] Thoreya: yup. if the game was in a good state youd still have all the streamers playing
[3:54:49] N3llee: werent the numbers down by a goods amount though?
[3:54:58] Thoreya: @N3llee no
[3:55:01] Drizz_36: i don't know, i do see people talk about it in game a lot. there are always people who will only play wow though
[3:55:01] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee a lot of the people said they cared and then just used the lawsuit to shit on the devs.
[3:55:03] Thoreya: it was a very successful quarter for wow
[3:55:07] ninja_pengu1n: that's cause wow has too many players who are assholes irl
[3:55:08] Drizz_36: even on the PTR
[3:55:10] BoiAtomico: I mean, New World was a breath of fresh air and the game lost it due to lack of content and the content being bugged to shit. It had everything to succeed and right now it's dying out D:
[3:55:12] dopieGG: PEEPS
[3:55:26] wetttnine: Can I ask why you stopped played TBC?
[3:55:27] Molvonos: It just happened that the internal problems coincided with the shitty state the game's in, so people kinda lumped the two together.,
[3:55:28] Shrenko: Guild Wars 2 best mmo out right now
[3:55:33] Thoreya: yikes
[3:55:33] Shrenko: IMO!
[3:55:34] SilkeySmooth: i cant progress in m+ because i dont have a phone
[3:55:35] AnthMann: Is wow made by company being sued or is that wrong company? Anybody know?
[3:55:41] gooseboy429: i got my bf installed already
[3:55:49] tdpark_: battlefield 2042 will be a shitshow when launch
[3:55:53] Arroneous: I need to get back into guild wars 2
[3:55:54] BoiAtomico: Truth be told, Kelani made the smart decision on keeping the WoW content LUL everyone went out of WoW and he was almost the only relatively known person pumping out content about it
[3:55:56] wolvenhunt: true and it's not like Amazon does not have the same shit going on in their company, just like in any other big cooperation
[3:56:02] Shrenko: @AnthMann yes
[3:56:02] kmac187: Didnt boycott because that negatively impacts those who had nothing to do with the harassments as well
[3:56:05] Thoreya: until everyone gets tired of those games after like a month
[3:56:09] SabertoothEwok: Until Bobby is out as CEO nothing really is gunna change
[3:56:14] N3llee: Nah Blizz/Activision numbers were  down across the board in just about every game according to their stock price and sich
[3:56:16] Aidler: even NW has a chance to come back if they deliver
[3:56:19] Alepouditsa: @Thoreya yep
[3:56:22] SilkeySmooth: m+ is now locked behind a phine...lol
[3:56:28] SilkeySmooth: locked
[3:56:30] lumaday: and they seem really happy
[3:56:35] d1plaza: whats the announcement?
[3:56:40] MexicanMisker: i really get the sense that most players just want Shadowlands to be "over" at this point
[3:56:43] LegoCoin: I think we get new expansion annoucnment next year?
[3:56:45] BigDawgDan: you think Asmon has any chance to get on the Community Council?
[3:56:47] Sendakian: Ppl don't want to watch a streamer play a feature that made him stop playing the game
[3:56:54] Deathkanigit101: you think this brings in the possibility of blizzard sponsored streams with alot of content creators moving on?
[3:56:55] Thoreya: wow is the #1 on twitch rn
[3:56:56] Buckwink: hopefully they skip 9.3 and just start working on 10.0
[3:56:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10.0 needs to be amazing, to win people back
[3:56:58] Thoreya: for mmos
[3:56:59] BoiAtomico: @Aidler Just got fix the bugs and take their time with the new content to make it pristine and that game is flying
[3:57:02] Nafalyno: it would be nice to get housing/ guild house in wow specially from 17 years of style :P
[3:57:06] r0b928: My stock in Activison blizzard has tanked in the last 3 months. It sucks.
[3:57:21] Zivs: yeah i don't get that
[3:57:23] FreshieFresh: Only way 10.0 is going to be good is if we go back to Azeroth and the Old Gods have taken over everything. A new cataclysm to redo WoW from ground up.
[3:57:25] nerdtopia: he applied and got denied i think lmao
[3:57:27] HexaDroid: I kinda wanna play some wow again, but I'm so invested in FFXIV now too, don't really wanna play 2 lol
[3:57:31] nerdtopia: his app was kinda troll
[3:57:31] Drizz_36: he applied but i don't think he's going to get in
[3:57:36] Pannekaker: Think WoW is still gonna be #1 basically everywhere
[3:57:36] DallTV_: hehe they way hes aply was seemed alittle wierd
[3:57:50] LegoCoin: yeah blizzard wants feedback from non streamer perspective
[3:57:51] d1plaza: @faceforradiodetector no u
[3:57:54] EllisTheMenace1: wow is dead once roits mmo comes out
[3:57:55] bakurathewolf: 2??
[3:57:56] N3llee: its cause their player numbers are down
[3:58:02] Aidler: yeah the age of dead games is past. we now have different games for different players that follow different development cycles
[3:58:03] Kromede: KEKWlaugh
[3:58:04] nerdtopia: community council is just another excuse the devs can use to say their listening lmao
[3:58:04] Julia: 9.2 turns wow into a mobile game danJulia surpriiiise
[3:58:04] EllisTheMenace1: riky
[3:58:05] Rexialiton: 100% KEKW

[3:58:08] eakiller: don' you dare
[3:58:09] Jeanssi: WoW Immortal
[3:58:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could talk about mobile at any time, really
[3:58:10] ninja_pengu1n: "Don't you guys have cellphones"
[3:58:11] EllisTheMenace1: riots
[3:58:11] ArchNDA: what time is the annoucement ?

[3:58:13] ZeroTwoW: wow on consoles LUL
[3:58:13] DallTV_: petbattle 2.0
[3:58:17] Dewulfi: that would be a big mistake
[3:58:18] BoiAtomico: @FreshieFresh Only way 10.0 is going to be good is if somehow the writer team is fired and they actually hire someone who knows how to write a story and somehow Ion gets fired from Lead Dev KEKW
[3:58:18] Jattell: no 9.2 news but mobile news, get your pithcforks ready
[3:58:21] Raugdel: Phones KEKW

[3:58:31] Kromede: back to NW
[3:58:33] teodor4o: I bet they are gonna announce RUNES in wow !!!! like runes in d2 KEKW
[3:58:35] MexicanMisker: streamers already "have a voice" LUL they dont need to be on the panel
[3:58:36] childish_brandin0: He did it as a meme @Towelliee
[3:58:38] luckfore: exposed

[3:59:00] Xanigh: It's content for him
[3:59:01] RunningOutOfRAM: KEKW
[3:59:02] MrKhanes: I wouldnt announce a wow mobile game today, better to do it when 9.2 release if you ask me.
[3:59:02] solsaver12: I think Asmon applied for the council was for viewers content lol
[3:59:12] Meowzamere: @solsaver12 Yep
[3:59:13] LegoCoin: it would be dumb if it was - to much exclusive stuff already
[3:59:16] luckfore: ye he did it to make a YT vid out of it
[3:59:24] SteveSD: forgot how much DBM makes raidinb bumer bowling
[3:59:25] BoiAtomico: These mofos are literally writting the story as they go with the patches and didn't even realise they were ripping off the Thanos I love death arc KEKW
[3:59:28] Bromicide: how long until 9.2 announcement?
[3:59:31] SteveSD: bumper

[4:00:24] d1stract10n: lol
[4:00:25] Drizz_36: @Bromicide, 2 hours, 20 minutes
[4:00:30] Drizz_36: or thereabouts
[4:00:35] Bromicide: ty drizz
[4:01:10] Drizz_36: like preach said, they have had this feedback available for years
[4:01:15] Kromede: council KEKW
[4:01:21] Crumikz: They need to just show some action instead
[4:01:24] kissesaurus: council of Horde?
[4:01:25] Phantomstrk: as long as it doesn't go the way of the twitch safety council which ended up being all sizzle no steak...
[4:01:27] BigDawgDan: true lol just a PR spot now
[4:01:28] Tomaterrs: buzzword
[4:01:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's all in the forums already
[4:01:30] d1stract10n: @Qhaz_ pallies have stupid high damage for a tank and the other players are just randoms so probably alts
[4:01:32] Thoreya: ion said they were stuck in their old ways
[4:01:32] nerdtopia: it's just an excuse they can use to say their listening to the community lmfao
[4:01:33] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:01:33] BoiAtomico: I get hating on GRR Martin for taking 20 years to write the last 2 volumes for A Song of Ice and Fire, but the dude at least is trying to make it cohesive and coherent, the WoW writers are actually worse than HBOs GoT last season writers and that's a fucking achievement in itself LUL
[4:01:34] throwawaym3: Blizzard just needed to change there philosophy on how to create WoW content, and Ion already stated they are doing that. WoW Saved bro
[4:01:34] Julia: councils work well, like on twitch danJulia
[4:01:36] DarkDragonSlash: Blizzard have done more underhtinking then overthinking these past years KEKW
[4:01:38] Thoreya: m glad he acknowledged that
[4:01:43] StoicTaurus: Council is there to make constuct which contains equal representation of different kinds of players
[4:01:47] Kinghorn: feenLUL Julia
[4:01:49] Drizz_36: i don't mind more communication though, they need to talk to us more
[4:01:50] Kromede: haha Julia
[4:01:59] Kisswani: Julia danP
[4:02:04] Aidler: I think in the past they didn’t know who to listen to…
[4:02:04] VrtniPatuljak: iloveyalun ion IS the problem LUL
[4:02:07] Julia: Kisswani towHi
[4:02:09] HexaDroid: They will just blame the council from now on.
[4:02:13] LegoCoin: wrong people making decisons is the problem
[4:02:17] cappei: Goes in one ear, straight out the other
[4:02:23] VrtniPatuljak: 🦌 deer council
[4:02:23] Thirn94: Hey @Towelliee  and chat towHi
[4:02:31] RunningOutOfRAM: From  where do  you know ?
[4:02:35] Brodih_: listening but not hearing
[4:02:46] BoiAtomico: @Towelliee out of curiosity, in case you know it, since wich expac is Ion the lead game dev?
[4:03:08] Zenfar_: @TheAtomicRam Legion, it has ion in the name Kappa
[4:03:11] throwawaym3: @VrtniPatuljak He said hes going to change his views and admitted he was wrong. ill give him the benefit of the doubt. people can change
[4:03:12] Grinds: They just want the council to have a group to put the blame on when things dont work out
[4:03:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ion took over for Legion, if I remember right
[4:03:16] BoiAtomico: @Zenfarty KEKW
[4:03:24] Aidler: @theatomicram I believe since Legion launch
[4:03:31] Thoreya: ion said they were stuck in their old ways and acknowledge it will change. all i needed to hear
[4:03:33] batsun1corn: guys, how long till announcement?
[4:03:36] Thoreya: bc that was exacftly the problem
[4:03:38] kennepasta: has anything been announced yet
[4:03:41] mr_zeli: @Towelliee exactly...you are right about the council. If they will act like so far...it will be useless
[4:03:43] HexaDroid: ion needs to go, I hate his lawyer answers to everything
[4:03:48] the_real_doncheadle: It'll be noon cst
[4:03:52] VrtniPatuljak: iloveyalun thats big of him, but ppl rarely change. hes a numbers guy thats all he sees
[4:03:53] BoiAtomico: @Thoreya That's what they wanted you to hear
[4:03:53] cappei: @Thoreya People still believe Ion?
[4:03:58] Arroneous: Need ppl who want to improve gameplay and not just care about lining their pockets
[4:04:10] Sarcastard: Council is Just PR fluff...
[4:04:15] Aidler: @theatomicram but conceptual Legion was envisioned before he became game director
[4:04:23] rLeo2: is toxic relationship between us and blizz
[4:04:23] Kromede: i did nothing wrong IonJam
[4:04:25] Full_Aggr0: Whats up towelliee
[4:04:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ion is a raid guy, and I think that's always been his focus and he didn't pay much attention to everything else
[4:04:27] Drizz_36: i agree, i'd like to believe it but i need to see it, not just once either but as a new pattern of behavior
[4:04:28] CasuallyEfficient: It’s gunna be different this time COPIUM
[4:04:29] mr_zeli: I would like if Ion would go away...I hate his kind of WoW. Its so boring
[4:04:33] GhostShaman: Wait....when did he admit he was wrong?

[4:04:43] BoiAtomico: @Thoreya He's been saying "We're listening to your feedback" since Legion .3 patch
[4:04:43] Zenfar_: didn't ion blame the old devs teachings and not himself LUL
[4:04:45] just_laxus: to be fair ion is a pretty smart guy that makes it even harder
[4:04:47] Kinghorn: IonJam
[4:04:51] throwawaym3: @VrtniPatuljak Eh, sounds like your speculating. Ill wait and see what his actions show.
[4:04:54] flebbooo: Somehow i admire his stubborness but obviously sometimes u need to take an L LUL
[4:04:59] GhostShaman: God Im behind on all the news 🤦🏻♂️
[4:05:01] Phantomstrk: yup...i'd be over the moon if they brought back the old style raid progression of different "instances" for the progression instead of this 1 raid "slider" difficulty design decision
[4:05:03] cappei: It's impressive how a guy can be in charge of the 2 WoW expansions with the shittiest design philosophies in WoW history and still keep his job.
[4:05:07] Zettabyte: I feel nostalgic seeing WoW being played on this channel again, a little teary eyed :3
[4:05:08] LegoCoin: if the right people make better decisions that are making the decisions it will get better
[4:05:09] mynameisjonas79: SEVEN ADs...
[4:05:11] VrtniPatuljak: iloveyalun im speaking from experience, ppl are who they are
[4:05:25] Sarcastard: Make an MMO   not a FPS blend
[4:05:26] throwawaym3: @VrtniPatuljak People can change, happens all the time.
[4:05:31] ayohammie: council is a joke
[4:05:38] Caibo1: I'm not going back until at least 10.0 and only if they do that right.
[4:05:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mike is awesome
[4:05:51] BoiAtomico: @Aidler So, basicly, Ion became Lead Game after the major work for the one of the best expac was done and is the one in charge for two of the worst ones (imo BfA and SL are worse than WoD so...)?

[4:06:56] mrrazputin: Towelliee will first become a Chancellor. And than the Imperator
[4:06:58] blazyturtle: WoD was more fun than BFA or shadowlands tho

[4:08:01] nitemare34godd: ok
[4:08:02] MexicanMisker: in the video it was "at least 100"
[4:08:02] Mcaffee: a 100 people is like 85 to many
[4:08:04] RunningOutOfRAM: Inside INFO KEKW
[4:08:04] EpicJune: whta kinda council with 100 KEKW
[4:08:05] Aidler: @theatomicram on a positive note you could say the best time of Legion was under his leadership… but BFA and now SL are just bad (except 8.2)
[4:08:09] Alacod: what time?
[4:08:12] Kromede: he knows towPog

[4:17:32] HAMMERRAZOR: @TheAtomicRam haha exactly, the good thing is ven though mobile, it feels and plays exactly like a diablo game and its actually got some good aspects in it that would be good for daiblo 4. They have daily missions and quest boards and a few other things. If they take its time with diablo 4 its better then rushing it
[4:17:34] LegoCoin: it does just not allot
[4:17:35] j_bar111: I use to get it on every boss almost
[4:17:35] magemaster225: it does, its per boss
[4:17:36] Delacrois: I got 1 in a full clear in 9.1.5 from lfr

[4:17:47] LolitaAldea: maybe you need to do some quest
[4:17:48] Meowzamere: It's kinda weird, it doesn't popup, but the renowned is higher
[4:17:54] theoriginalzinng: just less of a chance
[4:17:54] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee I troll ussualy but you need to farm L9 OF TORGAST
[4:17:56] dutrockbridge: People have been farming renown in Torghast
[4:18:01] manmower: you get renown but it doesn't show popups usually
[4:18:01] theoriginalzinng: like 0-40 its 100% chance
[4:18:03] Zivs: if u hover the 65 it says where u can get it i think
[4:18:03] Mattsta: i got a single renown from lfr in 9.1.5...i feel like they have nerfed it
[4:18:04] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee spam level 9 torghast
[4:18:05] ContraRob: Highlight the number it will tell you
[4:18:07] Voramir: I don't think it's guaranteed past a certain point
[4:18:07] theoriginalzinng: 4-50 is like 60 or something
[4:18:07] Masqerader: go kill the world boss if u haven't should get 1
[4:18:15] theoriginalzinng: 50+ is lowish
[4:18:26] Voramir: yeah
[4:18:32] Zivs: you can buy 40 renown for 500g
[4:18:34] sinlesssinner: well u get 40 renown asap, at 50
[4:18:34] j_bar111: You can buy up to 40 for like couple hundred gold
[4:18:35] magemaster225: ehhhh
[4:18:36] Reckless_Monk: you get 40R for 500g
[4:18:37] throwawaym3: yes 40
[4:18:46] KaisenSiru: Yes
[4:18:46] BoiAtomico: oh shit, since Ion keeps the talks about "An RPG that feels like an RPG" for WoW, madman me just thought "Imagine Blizzard outsourcing Obsidian to write the quests and design for a Warcraft game or expansion. THAT SHIT WOULD BE DOPE! @Towelliee
[4:18:46] Voramir: fresh 60 yesterday I got to 61 after using the 40 skip
[4:18:52] warrenny: Fuck the jailor quest so tedious
[4:18:57] magemaster225: farming layer 9-11 in torghast is the fastest renown gain
[4:18:58] jarilrpg: you can get 60+ renown just from leveling with fates, and starting with the 40 renown item
[4:19:05] Khlaro: Dang, you still remember how to play? duckKek
[4:19:06] j_bar111: @Towelliee hazel said if you are lvling an alt send the 40 boost to them b4 you start leveling

[4:22:07] RobinDePoppin: Why not do it like FF14? U play the game and if u're done with the quests u take a break until next patch..
[4:22:10] PrimalRain: I just want classes to feel good and there to be a good stream of content that is fun
[4:22:17] Drizz_36: that would have required them to listen to feedback in alpha and beta, which they admitted they didn't do
[4:22:33] Reckless_Monk: i mean the community can be cry babies when they shouldnt be
[4:22:35] RobinDePoppin: BFA was amazingly bad.
[4:22:43] Sikkbass: That's done on purpose though @Towelliee don't you think?
[4:22:44] EpicJune: they're too stuborn at the  start
[4:22:46] j_bar111: Stubburn
[4:22:46] rymerre: its because they always go for retention first and gameplay second
[4:22:49] Drizz_36: that's not good enough anymore IMO, i'm tired of waiting a year for these expansions to be fun
[4:22:54] manmower: where would they go from there if they started out amazing?
[4:22:56] cappei: Because they only implement player feedback in the last patch KEKW

[4:22:56] HAMMERRAZOR: @TheAtomicRam i still think we varian will save anduin, to many things keep leading back to the compass and it keeps getting singled out in cinematics since legion
[4:22:57] Masqerader: if they had kept Twilight Devastation this expansion would have been amazing :P
[4:23:04] LegoCoin: I think its also the naysayers finally fade away and the positive comes from the dedicated players
[4:23:08] AJPro: Or die in the middle LUL
[4:23:10] Reveq: they take too long to act on the feedback tho :(
[4:23:13] luckfore: yup
[4:23:13] Mojohusk: I hope but remain sceptical
[4:23:14] wetttnine: I still have mechagon rep grind nightmares
[4:23:14] xxplicitt: I think people enjoyed the SL launch
[4:23:15] Wcvechten: I'm literally going in with 0 expectations tonight
[4:23:15] RobinDePoppin: The corruption vendor ended with a bang
[4:23:15] Velladyn: Start introducing new classes mid expansion, I'm ready
[4:23:21] teodor4o: towGift
[4:23:22] smashwow: 4th time? we've been having these issues since mop/cata no?
[4:23:25] Eyeofmetal: They need to stop coming up with new gimmicks each xpac and go back to focusing on the core of the game.
[4:23:26] ayohammie: they ignore asmongold application for council LUL
[4:23:27] warrenny: Nah bod was great 8.2 kinda sucked imo patch ive played the least since legion
[4:23:28] lifeswings: what are you talking about man? they always had good feedback that they totally ignored
[4:23:30] bargar28: CHAMPION!!!! I NEED YOUR AID....
[4:23:33] PrimalRain: if only they used alpha and beta feedback
[4:23:35] szble: preach bro
[4:23:37] Ichiban__GG: They should just listen more to the community and streamers like yourself that give good feedback. They wait until .2 or .3 before they change what they should have in the beta
[4:23:40] manmower: less systems, more content, more story
[4:23:41] luckfore: they finally realised that in 9.1.5
[4:23:43] GhostShaman: if I want to grind 1000 hours for gear, achieves, flight, I should be able to do so without having to wait for (x) date/time.
[4:23:45] cappei: They think they know better than their players; their product shows otherwise
[4:23:48] rymerre: right...cuz they design the game for retention only and when that fails they switch to gameplay
[4:23:51] UltimaWeap: its really weird
[4:23:53] Kelticlore: I heard a Rumor that by the time 10.0 comes around Ion will be leaving
[4:23:54] Malkyr: Every MMO on the market is better if you wait until the developers put in catch up mechanics to do the content.
[4:23:55] RobinDePoppin: More dungeons, raids, zones & collectables. Thats what I want :)
[4:24:00] HAMMERRAZOR: the real expansion is always the last patch
[4:24:03] imagine6917: tier sets finnaly?
[4:24:04] Reckless_Monk: Legion was awesome.. but people whined about the legendaries.. even though the game was awesome, and yet you saw so many people cried that they had to farm for a lego
[4:24:08] j_bar111: 9.1.5 is like all the feedback given about covenants
[4:24:12] luckfore: they can be in 10.0
[4:24:12] Zivs: well they revamped conduits, they were gonna be consumed on use KEKHeim
[4:24:14] Masqerader: and there way got them self inflicted ass clap
[4:24:24] throwawaym3: Thats such a terrible mindset for a business selling consumer products lmao
[4:24:29] DarkRattz: this was for sure the xpac where i felt the cards were stacked against the players moe so than any other when it came to communication
[4:24:36] j_bar111: Blizz = monkaS
[4:24:36] Murtuoso: True
[4:24:40] RobinDePoppin: they have nothing to put out though KEKw
[4:24:42] BoiAtomico: @HAMMERRAZOR gotta go check those cutscenes! Wrote that completely out of my ass KEKW
[4:24:42] magemaster225: endwalker gonna be a critical hit
[4:24:42] Pannekaker: Pretty sure WoW is still the top
[4:24:50] xxplicitt: They have to make some big strides to earn trust back and get players to hop back over
[4:24:52] luckfore: if 10.0 is good they will have the upper hand again @Towelliee
[4:24:53] Sneekzx: Imagine paying for something, and not getting what you want. That's a failing business model at the end of the day. Customers will determine whether you stay relevant or not.
[4:24:56] HAMMERRAZOR: @TheAtomicRam KEKW
[4:25:00] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee thats cus of the lawsuit.. not cus of the expansion
[4:25:01] Buckwink: Plant was mentally broken
[4:25:06] Rytten: whoever thought removing xp buff from heirloom :(
[4:25:08] Alepouditsa: realy? didn't look likes it
[4:25:16] JeanRalphio_: @Towelliee But they just had one of their most profitable quarters from the investor meeting that took place a week or two ago.
[4:25:17] RobinDePoppin: They have no content though KEKW
[4:25:17] Jeanssi: do the chests
[4:25:18] Xailen: chests
[4:25:19] Machine42593: BIG ELITES
[4:25:19] Baco08: no this is the way
[4:25:21] teodor4o: lol
[4:25:21] UltimaWeap: chests
[4:25:21] Aervyper: @Towelliee you haven't playing WoW in 4 months. Your right now number one viewers in WoW. That just shows you the utter VACUUM that exists in wow and truely how bad it is
[4:25:24] magemaster225: its just a shitty quest
[4:25:25] donol: @Towelliee FYI, get the caches, they drop 5/6
[4:25:25] Stangin2122: Like ANYONE in the world..hit them in the pocket book and they will start to pay attention
[4:25:26] mrrazputin: Kill big elits and chests
[4:25:26] tiberiusmason: the riftbound chests
[4:25:27] Masqerader: the elite dudes are fastest
[4:25:28] Mattsta: the chests
[4:25:29] wolvenhunt: chests open
[4:25:30] HAMMERRAZOR: kill the green guys and bigger elites
[4:25:30] Kauko13: they still are the agressor... who is there they should be affraid of? Nobody
[4:25:33] magemaster225: chest and elites
[4:25:34] pellz: lol hes back on wow
[4:25:35] BrotherBeezy: The chests have like 4 or 5 each
[4:25:38] pellz: what about new world?
[4:25:39] kashmara: well and it seems that for a while there were no new MMOs, and now we have our pick really
[4:25:53] Iver_monk: Krig_Bear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[4:25:54] Druizzz: @Towelliee also kill the elites
[4:25:54] Shrenko: they are the underdogs FrankerZ
[4:25:55] Tyrrindorr: best thing thats gonna happen is WotLK re release, then the game is gonna die out
[4:25:56] Molvonos: Amazon had the chance  to do something amazing and they thoroughly fucked that up for tthemselves, somehow.
[4:26:02] tiberiusmason: this quests increases the drop rate of relics i think
[4:26:03] Reckless_Monk: FF14 is in the same content draught. The only reason people are hyped for the game.. is because of new bigger content creators playing it.. like Asmon
[4:26:05] Kromede: ConcernDoge
[4:26:18] xenophar: A game this old making a come back COPIUM
[4:26:18] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee What if the jailer brings us back to before the sunwell explosion. And we get a revamped azeroth in its pure state? POGGERS
[4:26:19] Nafalyno: im playing LA at the moment its amazing :D:P
[4:26:22] HAMMERRAZOR: wake up call
[4:26:22] Crunker01: @Towelliee What would you think about dungeons and raids being having dynamic groups, like you could play with any amount of people in the group
[4:26:23] Malkyr: @Aervyper Yeah but WoW still has over 10k more viewers then any other MMO. It is just not all on a few big names anymore since they all took breaks
[4:26:24] Aervyper: @Molvonos Lost Ark looks and feels amazing
[4:26:25] LolitaAldea: yep
[4:26:29] Rytten: There is no way they didnt think of there would be less subs with less content
[4:26:31] luckfore: if 10.0 is good they will have the upper hand again @Towelliee
[4:26:33] UltimaWeap: we are not safe yet lol
[4:26:34] magakigr: to be honest regardless of the whole situation at blizzard, for me wow is still the better mmo and of course competition will only make it better
[4:26:38] PrimalRain: right, they need this to hopefully have actual change
[4:26:47] Shrenko: D:
[4:26:47] LolitaAldea: they let this to happen
[4:26:51] Celestia6: Good morning! Can't wait for the news today :D
[4:26:51] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee favorite saying that blizz has taken to heart, "You can't save your face and your ass at the same time"
[4:26:55] Sollice: @Towelliee Did you see ROBOLOX is the most valuable gaming company? Surpassed Activision-Blizzard.
[4:26:56] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Would u want to see boss battles like FF14 trials in WoW?
[4:26:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: people suck
[4:26:57] Imperius_Aeon: wokies
[4:26:59] Xailen: 9.2 stuff will determine if they want to fix it or not
[4:27:01] Buckwink: my guild bled players because people werent enjoying the game, not because of the internal stuff
[4:27:01] mavericks312: where they wrong though
[4:27:01] CasuallyEfficient: Too streamers are just following the crowd for money tho
[4:27:01] smashwow: @Reckless_Monk that's not the only reason. sure it gave it exposure, but you can clearly see the way the devs care about the game/community vs the wow devs.
[4:27:04] HAMMERRAZOR: hopefully from all this bad we get alot of good
[4:27:05] Draz3nx: that's the problem there not thinking
[4:27:06] Molvonos: @Aervyper No doubt, but Amazon didn't create that game, they just published it.  Talking about New World.
[4:27:12] Murtuoso: Yeah them vs community is not a great idea.
[4:27:13] xenophar: Surviving off nostalgia no matter what they do to it
[4:27:17] throwawaym3: Blizzards ego was wayyyyy too big
[4:27:17] Sollice: ROBLOX is worth 62 million
[4:27:21] warrenny: If they are assholes or trolls call them out
[4:27:22] Odinslayer: well some content creators do get under your skin as a dev tbh
[4:27:29] zanis_: Have to admit - love seeing you back in WoW @Towelliee
[4:27:42] Sneekzx: Blizzard needed to be humbled and I think they finally realized that and now they are taking action. Their ego and pride got the best of them imo.
[4:27:50] Molvonos: @Sollice Eeeeewwwww
[4:27:52] Reckless_Monk: @smashwow still in a content draught. so many of their community has brought that up. its true though the devs care ALOT more for their community then blizzard cares about us
[4:27:54] rymerre: but at what cost? forcing yourself to play something you dont like
[4:27:56] cardinalism: Asmongold did not quit, he just took a break
[4:27:58] Aervyper: @Molvonos i know but New World can be trash right now it's not like anything is coming that hurts New World..... FF14 will have a blip
[4:28:10] bawheid: what have blizz done other than change a few names and sack a few creeps?
[4:28:14] bloodgulch_survivor: Need to release Titan imo
[4:28:21] CardinalTX: When is the announcement again?    two hours?
[4:28:25] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Would u want to see FF14 trails in WoW?
[4:28:30] smashwow: @MedeirosGamingg i wouldn't say they're humbled. you can see it in the body language. they're pissed more than anything and that's not good.
[4:28:31] Molvonos: @Aervyper New World is hurting itself.  Anything else is just sideeffect at this point.
[4:28:36] LegoCoin: They released a BETA for seasons LUL
[4:28:39] Odinslayer: i mean its a good thing that this canceling happend to them, so they wake up and fix their shit

[4:28:52] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee 9.1.5 did help ALOT though
[4:28:55] bloodgulch_survivor: Titan will save Blizz fo sho
[4:28:56] RobinDePoppin: Copiun
[4:28:58] Nokterian: Copium
[4:29:01] RobinDePoppin: Copium
[4:29:02] HAMMERRAZOR: hey @MrKray2
[4:29:05] Odinslayer: Copium idd
[4:29:10] bawheid: this patch will be worse than the last few
[4:29:11] Sollice: He said VentureBeat but I heard TigerBeat in my head. Please help
[4:29:13] rymerre: eh...not likely
[4:29:18] PrimalRain: WoG18 titan became overwatch though
[4:29:21] Shrenko: good thing about the announcement: its a video so you can pause as much as you like @Towelliee to discuss stuff
[4:29:24] Farfic: 9.1.5 should've been in 9.0
[4:29:24] TrioDeFo: wow is pretty much going to die hard
[4:29:30] Screamnsteam: @bawheid COPIUM
[4:29:35] Velladyn: But everyone will be sucked back in with a solid announcement, going to love seeing people eat their words. WoW is best when they are pushed into a corner as sad as it is
[4:29:37] TrioDeFo: i think at least
[4:29:40] Masqerader: Ya but at the same time Amazon treats its everyday employees like shit, and their female devs had to suffer through the same bro culture bullshit, even during New World and no one batted an eye
[4:29:41] SteveSD: if people have learned anything during this covid downtime its actions speak louder than words lol
[4:29:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol WoW is not dead and it's not going to die. It still makes money!
[4:29:44] momofantv: @TrioDeFo cant wait
[4:29:46] mavericks312: @TrioDeFo guess you didnt see the sales reports last week
[4:29:46] rymerre: @TrioDeFo not likely
[4:29:55] bloodgulch_survivor: @PrimalRain they need that new blood
[4:30:07] LegoCoin: yum dead game LUL
[4:30:16] Nafalyno: Well Riot games is making one xD  dont underestimated them xD
[4:30:24] SteveSD: its like a dead horse, its still there, just needs time to rot and turn into bones
[4:30:24] TrioDeFo: It's never gonna completely die meaning "nobody is gonna play it" but the company is trash and they are butchering the game
[4:30:27] majorizc: @Towelliee give us your playlist pls. sounds awesome
[4:30:28] RobinDePoppin: WoW feels so fuicking borring now though
[4:30:28] maxlol: i remember watching toweliee prot pally pvp videos in cataclysm.. im 23 now. good guy towel
[4:30:33] NuAera: we have heard wow is dead for 17 years :)
[4:30:33] Reckless_Monk: ABK is still one of if not the most proffitable company. LOLW
[4:30:36] momofantv: @Towelliee 14 has more players
[4:30:36] LegoCoin: yeah wow aint really going to be dead ever
[4:30:37] BoiAtomico: @HAMMERRAZOR If they do go Varian, it will be with an heartbreaking moment of reunion of Dad and Son, kinda like Arthas and his dad atop ICC, where Varian tells Anduin how much he is proud of him and that Sylvana's didn't desert him, but that the battle was lost and she had to back out, leading to the establishing of the 1st global unified government of Azeroth united Azeroth forces against the new forces of evil, with Thrall and Baine and Jaina as his trusted advisors, enabling x-faction raids
[4:30:37] rymerre: wow wont die hard...if a game like SWTOR is still going WoW will go on for many more years
[4:30:41] PToastman: wall
[4:30:45] Naturalbeef: Have you seen what they are doing in 9.2?
[4:31:00] Odinslayer: how long the video they will release you think it will be? a 2 min video?
[4:31:03] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Lore in 10.0 needs to go back to normal stuff not space shit.
[4:31:05] Getitonthelow: what time is the announcement?
[4:31:05] Soraoblivian: world peace on azeroth
[4:31:08] Davcev: arent cod and wow dead for like 7 years like everyone says but everyopne play OMEGALUL
[4:31:11] DeanoTV: 10.0 void lords Kreygasm
[4:31:13] manmower: Jaina is gonna die
[4:31:13] Shrenko: yes
[4:31:16] Miklagard: I belive there will be a big bad in 10.0 :O
[4:31:18] SteveSD: paying a subscription model for WoW nowdays? yeah no, this game should be a box price and thats it
[4:31:20] bawheid: why make another player council when the last player council failed?
[4:31:21] Thoreya: weve been in azeroth for like 5 expansions
[4:31:23] Thoreya: im cool being other places
[4:31:25] Inari_is_awesome: Inari_is_awesome subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:31:28] Screamnsteam: Tauren rogues finally
[4:31:28] TheDeathbinder: Have they met the announcement yet?
[4:31:29] Soraoblivian: maybe mogu come back
[4:31:31] rymerre: yes...thats literally what they are doing now one xpac at a time
[4:31:31] HAMMERRAZOR: @TheAtomicRam definitely and what better time for anduin to actually say good bye, all the main characters got closure with theones they lost
[4:31:32] OxidTV: No not everyone like classic rofl
[4:31:34] Shrenko: they are gonna delete retail and make new content for classiic and release new expansions :)
[4:31:39] bloodgulch_survivor: Eve 2
[4:31:40] TheDeathbinder: Made*
[4:31:42] Mattsta: @Getitonthelow 10am pacific...just under 2hrs
[4:31:45] luckfore: just guessing right Kappa
[4:31:45] paradoxTheDJ: Towelliee is Back!!!!!!!!
[4:31:45] Davcev: you playing season of mastery towellie?
[4:31:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tauren rogues would be funny
[4:31:52] TrioDeFo: @rymere1983 dying doesnt mean the game is no longer being played. The game wil always be alive in that sense. But the game is gonna die hard meaning its probably seen its last hoorah
[4:31:59] crashoverride_gaming: Lol wow isn’t dead. It’s just “for now, dead to me” there is a lot of good games out so yeah! I want to play those. Wow isn’t “dead” though
[4:31:59] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee POGGERS SO NEW TIMELINE OF AZEROTH??
[4:31:59] smashwow: idk about wow being top, bell did a video on MAU, and those numbers are basically the same as FF14. if it is top we're talking thousands not millions in the delta.
[4:32:03] Getitonthelow: thank you @mattsta
[4:32:05] RandomSound: Can't wait to see the next big bad that was actually controlling Zooval from the start
[4:32:06] RobinDePoppin: Clipped
[4:32:08] bloodgulch_survivor: Eve 2....THE SPREADSHEET ENDGAME
[4:32:10] Odinslayer: @weirdo_dude there's tauren monks so why not lol
[4:32:11] BoiAtomico: @HAMMERRAZOR It makes sense, but feels lazy writting and uses a lot of ex-machina if they go that way :(
[4:32:20] HAMMERRAZOR: true
[4:32:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I also like how Season of Mastery is developing
[4:32:28] TrioDeFo: Can't wait for AoC. Its gonna be the next big mmo probably
[4:32:29] rymerre: new world updates you say?
[4:32:36] wigglinjigglin: lost ark is amazing
[4:32:38] warrenny: Didnt they make that mistake in original classic
[4:32:39] Drizz_36: they'll just use layering in season of mastery, don't need as many servers
[4:32:45] OxidTV: swtor <3
[4:32:47] Getitonthelow: @towelliee you playing battlefield tonight?
[4:32:48] SwordandKeyboard: so has wow done much to change its image?
[4:32:51] Masqerader: I am just hyped for Battlefield 2042 and the gta 3 remaster
[4:32:54] smashwow: have they released a lot of info around SoM?
[4:32:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Classic can be a kickass game if they get rid of that purist crap and fix issues and open it up
[4:32:58] N3llee: Yea Jan is my guess as well
[4:33:05] Bubbyyz: yo towelliee u play fps ?

[4:37:35] Masqerader: @Aervyper How can u compare the 2 when u haven't even seen or played DIablo 4.
[4:37:39] HexaDroid: lost ark is banned in some eu countries cause of gam.bling
[4:37:50] Eraste: @nodramajustpizza_ he's playing wow no ff14 atm KEKW
[4:37:50] netc0dex: stay in the blood

[4:39:35] dinobille: 10 pst
[4:39:35] PrimalRain: 1 est
[4:39:38] UltimaWeap: "later than expected"
[4:39:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah D4 and Overwatch 2 are in 2023 now
[4:39:39] Ukiichrisgaming: How are you finding wow after your break? @Towelliee
[4:39:41] Green_Mountain_: Thx
[4:39:43] nathrizen: we didnt expect them in the next few years anyway
[4:39:49] Jollywhompus: It's hilarious that they delayed a game without a release date
[4:39:56] Throdio: Whatever the internal target was, will be missed
[4:40:00] Masqerader: Ah year later is what I would call delayed
[4:40:20] LazyDynamics: @Towelliee have you thought about how you would design a wow 10.0 endgame? like changes to M+, raids and other casual activities?
[4:40:56] MeisterPetze: get rid of m+
[4:41:01] Shrenko: m+ gets boring really fast for me
[4:41:03] wintry5: isnt the biggest wow problem right now lack of casual conent? m+/raids are kinda fine
[4:41:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people love mythic+, so I would say that's staying in
[4:41:10] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Give us more dungeons & raids. Less systems :)
[4:41:19] Pathoren: @Towelliee welcome back to WoW dude
[4:41:20] lithium364: i hope copium is enabled on youtube fduring the 9.2 strean
[4:41:22] warrenny: If they got rid of m+ tbh id be gone
[4:41:25] MVRD: I would love to see 10-man raiding tbh. I always preferred it over 20
[4:41:25] Masqerader: @Aervyper so what, you assume that everyone wants to play Lost Ark, like POE I have 0 interest in Lost Ark
[4:41:29] Crystalyzee: ewww korthia grinding i haven't looked at this place since i hit t6
[4:41:30] Jollywhompus: 10.0 needs a restructure on player economy and world pvp, M+ and Raids are in a good place IMO
[4:41:32] Aervyper: Mythic + is cancer
[4:41:37] Collected1: how does cross faction raiding work without cross faction guilds
[4:41:37] Shrenko: @lithium364 its not a stream its a video
[4:41:37] Eraste: i just want interesting content that isnt M+ or raids
[4:41:41] GhostShaman: I guess Im against the norm. I hate Mythic raiding. Same raid that hits harder with 1 or 2 extra mechanics per boss != content.
[4:41:43] KingSlayerYotam: make guilds cross factions, will fix a lot
[4:41:48] RobinDePoppin: Yes!!!!!!
[4:41:59] RobinDePoppin: Exactly
[4:42:00] kheenaii: im hoping they address boosting.. just something
[4:42:00] MVRD: VoteYea
[4:42:00] RobinDePoppin: You get it
[4:42:02] Aervyper: @Masqerader see and i have zero interest in blizzard
[4:42:08] V1raNi: yep, the variety
[4:42:10] DrTertuliano: let the war tô PVP
[4:42:14] PrimalRain: we need more dungeons throughout the expansion as well, not just a megadungeon
[4:42:21] OxidTV: @Towelliee like 2 or 3 raid for 1 tier in same patch
[4:42:24] EclipserEU: like launch of Wrath it was very good with 3 raids
[4:42:24] Julia: to be fair didnt wow have the most subs in the hera where mythic+ didnt exist? I dont know if the m+ community is very vocal or very big, but i m not an expert
[4:42:35] Celestia6: exactly
[4:42:36] shinta__: I like how in TBC and Classic you had one boss raids, it would be cool to have something similar where you explore different areas with one boss
[4:42:41] warrenny: Even just mini raid say an 8 boss raid then a 2 or 2 1 boss raids
[4:42:41] SanusSangria: Different environments as well with different raids
[4:42:42] Eraste: danJulia danHi @Julia
[4:42:42] V1raNi: I killed SD HC, mythics multiple times and  felt I had nothing to do
[4:42:44] Sollice: They can release an expansion with 7 dungeons, but they HAVE to put out more content at a more regular rate. Like every month or two and dungeons and some sort of raids should be included
[4:42:47] lintukellin: 9.2 same torghast aestethic but gold XD
[4:42:50] RobinDePoppin: Give us 2 raids and 15 dungeons at the start.
[4:42:52] 2eidy: big true
[4:42:54] Julia: Eraste danJulia towHi
[4:42:54] Collected1: boreghast
[4:42:55] PToastman: @julia I didn't realize you were a Towelliee viewer. Hi.
[4:42:56] wetttnine: The maw, yuck
[4:42:59] Beave_86: i think they should push back the release of the first raid a bit and add in dungeons sets
[4:43:01] Dein95: looks like an Asmongold inventory lol
[4:43:06] Throdio: If they are going to go with a Azeroth reborn, I feel they kind of have to do that
[4:43:06] Maxoru0: Korthia is such a bore lol
[4:43:12] Masqerader: @Aervyper exactly so why how can u feel sorry for a game company over nothing other than your personal preference, makes no sense. Just be happy and play w/e u like dude.
[4:43:13] UltimaWeap: The maw is awful still with mounting. the mob density is just out of control
[4:43:15] andrynist: what time should the announcement be approx?
[4:43:20] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Also more zones at the start of an expansion. Maybe less in depth per zone, but just bigger continents.
[4:43:23] rymerre: bro i heard you like torghast so we added more layers of torghast that your required to do
[4:43:24] Julia: PToastman towHi for a long time, but i lurk a lot
[4:43:37] Eraste: @andrynist 10am PST i believe, so maybe an hour and a half from now
[4:43:43] Shrenko: @Julia yes and no I think? Legion introduced m+ and had the most players ever if Im not mistaken! But also m+ is a big downhill now compared to when it released in Legion it was alot of fun then
[4:43:45] andrynist: @andrynist ty
[4:43:49] RobinDePoppin: but just 4 zones though
[4:43:50] Masqerader: @Eraste 30m
[4:43:51] Celestia6: I did not like the maw to begin with, and the fact we were always there was a big turn off for me
[4:44:01] LazyDynamics: i hope they remove all barriers from M+ and take the time pressure out of it. 8/10 M+ runs are toxic for me
[4:44:11] Eraste: @Masqerader nice, ty
[4:44:15] tydrennistv: welcome back!
[4:44:16] Sollice: @LazyDynamics ? Thats the entire point of M+
[4:44:26] tydrennistv: we missed you on azeroth
[4:44:26] RobinDePoppin: Ya
[4:44:34] MexicanMisker: BFA was 6 zones, much better atmosphere and art too
[4:44:34] Xailen: BFA had 6 zones from the start, some bigger than SL ones
[4:44:36] Julia: Shrenko maybe they need to keep it but shake the formula a lot
[4:44:37] RobinDePoppin: I just like the idea of Northrend. A big continent
[4:44:43] Starryskys: I don't mind it now that you can mount up in the maw
[4:44:45] Exergy044: imagine if we had a raid per zone
[4:44:50] Grumperss: World boss in the maw
[4:44:55] lithium364: if they touch grizzly hills people will be mad
[4:44:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: They need to fix it with the M+ keys, that's for sure. Having someone else ruin your key is bullshit
[4:45:00] benzona4: revendreath and ardenweald were pretty good
[4:45:04] GhostShaman: Who praised BFA...
[4:45:05] d1stract10n: Who the fuck just Praised BFA......
[4:45:06] Masqerader: BFA had Twilight Devastation, what's not to love
[4:45:06] mmrghost7: I MISS U TD :D
[4:45:08] Sollice: Yeah too bad the Horde zones in BfA were ass compared to Alliance
[4:45:08] N3llee: burn in hell
[4:45:09] kashmara: I enjoyed bfa, I never denied it XD
[4:45:10] itsrambo: BFA was better than legion
[4:45:11] N3llee: praising bfa
[4:45:12] Eraste: i admitted from the start I liked bfa more
[4:45:13] flebbooo: the cycle continues, now we praise bfa i guese KEKW
[4:45:13] RobinDePoppin: BFA was more like 3 zones.
[4:45:14] Zakali: I love Ardenweald
[4:45:16] LazyDynamics: @Sollice why not just make it more challenging aka more mechanics and harder hitting mobs. but give people time to do it
[4:45:16] kabam11: BFA was the peak
[4:45:17] GhostShaman: "SCOWL"
[4:45:19] Xailen: BFA is still bad, but SL is worse...
[4:45:21] xhold0utx: xhold0utx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:45:22] RobinDePoppin: I never went to Horde zones KEKW
[4:45:23] N3llee: bfa was shit
[4:45:23] Zoludar: Honestly miss Wod more then BFA
[4:45:25] DrTertuliano: miss The realm of Goraktul
[4:45:25] mandilozano: ppl talked shit about legion back then and now they think its good
[4:45:28] luckfore: hope 9.2 is as good or better than 8.2
[4:45:30] Buckwink: bfa was so much better
[4:45:30] RobinDePoppin: It didnt
[4:45:32] Sollice: @LazyDynamics Thats a different system then really.
[4:45:33] UltimaWeap: it was though
[4:45:35] warrenny: Bfa was underratedp
[4:45:35] GhostShaman: Towel stop trolling me
[4:45:40] lithium364: my grandpa said WoD good bfa bad
[4:45:42] Shrenko: @Julia yeah exactly what I've been saying for some time now. Also dungeons are really important to make m+ fun. Im not a fan of most Shadowlands dungeons
[4:45:42] MVRD: true!
[4:45:47] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee BFA had 3 zones for me. I never went over to horde side KEKW
[4:45:47] Jalham: BFA had more content is all
[4:45:48] Meliea_EU: zones were amazing in bfa, but lots mechanics were not
[4:45:51] magakigr: SL is obviously better than bfa
[4:45:51] Sollice: BfA 8.3
[4:45:52] Shrenko: BFA was ass at start aswell though @Towelliee
[4:45:53] Delacrois: yo I came back to the game in bfa
[4:45:53] d1stract10n: I hated the necklace and the armor.
[4:45:53] IronPhalanX: 9.2 was dope
[4:45:54] BigCarlM: i hated bfa a little less than SL
[4:45:54] Collected1: #BringBackCorruption
[4:45:55] Jake2400: Legion was peek wow
[4:45:55] PrimalRain: people do the same with wod too though
[4:45:57] N3llee: both xpacs sucked equally
[4:45:57] Buckwink: the people saying bfa wasnt better than SL didnt play bfa
[4:46:02] Maxoru0: oh BFA by far is better than SL
[4:46:02] warrenny: Thats a push
[4:46:02] LazyDynamics: @Sollice exactly. tight now its mythic raids with a time limit
[4:46:03] itsrambo: korthia is vomit
[4:46:04] Masqerader: BFA only got better when we could buy essences and corruption
[4:46:04] Havykk: BFA was better than SL, but BFA sucked and SL sucks more
[4:46:05] Arroneous: I hate necklace and azeroite gear
[4:46:05] RobinDePoppin: @Sollice CORRUPTION VENDOR KEKW
[4:46:09] MortiousPrime: BFA had way more to do
[4:46:09] Shrenko: BFA was ass before 8.2 @Towelliee
[4:46:14] wintry5: ppl saying bfa was better cuz they only look at 8.3 KEKW
[4:46:14] Khandak: 8.2 was amazing
[4:46:14] Putcride: @Towelliee i liked cata alot especially at the end when 4.3 came
[4:46:16] RealSolaroid: Shadowlands would be good if we didn't have to wait 10 years to get a content patch... and when we do the "content" was borderline non existant.
[4:46:19] FootOfGork: I didnt really care for the BFA zones
[4:46:21] Ribastur0075: 9.2 is over
[4:46:24] Scar_A: Every new expansion comes, the previous automatically gets praises. Same nonsense since TBC.
[4:46:25] Buckwink: bfa had things to do the entire expansion
[4:46:27] warrenny: Sl is good im just done with it for now
[4:46:27] MeisterPetze: me 2
[4:46:27] FootOfGork: Aesthetic wise
[4:46:28] NetherRegion: Lol fuckin nerds cant make up their mind..
[4:46:29] nodramajustpizzaa: what about legion tho @Towelliee
[4:46:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: I did have more fun in BFA, too
[4:46:35] Sollice: @VelzenTV EVERYONE loved the vendor, they just wanted ALL items to be available all the time. The RNG of visions everyone hated
[4:46:35] DrTertuliano: tão zones in 8.2
[4:46:35] N3llee: to much copium this morning... wtb Varity stream andy plz
[4:46:35] Julia: i got all the mounts from the bfa islands danJulia
[4:46:36] SilkeySmooth: bfa was good better then legion imo
[4:46:39] bloodgulch_survivor: wotlk bruh
[4:46:44] Masqerader: @Towelliee Solo queue island right now, best BFA content in SL
[4:46:51] Ribastur0075: bfa was too grindy, i liked bfa better tbh
[4:46:53] RobinDePoppin: @Sollice Exactly. I still dont understand why they did that...
[4:46:55] killswiitch: wut
[4:46:56] cRUSSIANthegame: What are you talking about? They enabled everything last week before pre-patch @Towelliee
[4:46:58] Meliea_EU: last expansions are all not that toon friendly, thats my main gripe
[4:47:03] RobinDePoppin: @Sollice So good, but so bad
[4:47:04] Buckwink: if you quit during bfa you dont have an opinion
[4:47:05] dopieGG: playing "every day" shouldn't be a requirement to enjoy a game tho
[4:47:05] Sollice: I should say the RNG of getting corruptions all together
[4:47:05] DrTertuliano: @masqerader good to leveling 10-50
[4:47:10] Shrenko: wooo ResidentSleeper
[4:47:11] DeanoTV: yep to level in islands too
[4:47:11] Rexialiton: I returned to wow after 3 years in 8.2
[4:47:12] TheDeathbinder: The world Quests were better in BFA but i still hate world quests
[4:47:15] Rexialiton: lol
[4:47:15] PToastman: content ahoy
[4:47:18] Masqerader: lol

[4:47:24] flazy_2595: PvE content was good PvP was trash
[4:47:24] kashmara: I liked in BFA that you could just go around and get an alt geared up from just world quests.
[4:47:35] JanRokit5: Bet
[4:47:35] r0b928: Right now
[4:47:38] magemaster225: soloing legion raids is still messed up
[4:47:41] Sollice: @swordart_19 LATER
[4:47:41] TakeThatBack: bye FELICIA
[4:47:43] gooball_tv: I played the shit out of BFA, only expansion since WOTLK that I ranked Gladiator 3 times, and the raids were really good. Never understood the BFA hate. I hate to admit it, I liked the story as well.

[4:49:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the game does need real tier sets, every time
[4:49:09] shinta__: Tier sets back will be so cool.
[4:49:10] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee 9,2 last patch and 9.2.5 pre patch?
[4:49:10] Ribastur0075: 90 minutes
[4:49:12] flebbooo: yes with actual set bonuses
[4:49:13] Shrenko: they will probably put a grind and currency behind tier sets
[4:49:14] Kromede: still rocking 1565287 AP
[4:49:16] drozie: imo they recycle to much content look at 9.1 it was an invasion on the maw. 8.1 was an invasion 7.1 was an invasion. last 3 expansion have been dog
[4:49:18] Rexialiton: 
[4:49:19] magemaster225: new patch name: Copium's End

[4:49:24] Molvonos: I'm still saving my points to delete Fiesta Potato.
[4:49:34] RobinDePoppin: The jailor is going to remake reality. Reality = Azeroth. Thats why towellie said a new version of Azeroth earlier. He knows Kappa
[4:49:35] Eraste: tier pieces require tier shards that drop randomly from random bosses and you need 10 for one piece Kappa
[4:49:35] one2gone: @PToastman maybe you should trade it in then
[4:49:36] zanis_: We're going to Zereth Mortis and learning about the 7th power.
[4:49:38] LekeroleN: Kromede get the 5m one Kappa
[4:49:46] Ballsonfire_: especially when everyone asked for less systems

[4:49:57] Zenfar_: they pretty much did everything people asked them not to do going from bfa to SL
[4:49:58] SSD511_: Yes
[4:49:59] AIphaSwift: LUL
[4:50:01] tdpark_: annoucement in 30 mins?
[4:50:04] warrenny: They said it was all frontloaded tho
[4:50:04] PrimalRain: "you hate systems huh? How about we double down on them"
[4:50:05] Mattsta: but Towellie...Tier Sets 'totally' are not borrowed power so it's 'fine'...
[4:50:07] rymerre: easy...player retention
[4:50:09] PToastman: burn him
[4:50:12] RealSolaroid: I reckon in 9.2 we will be placing runes on our gear on-top of our shards LUL
[4:50:17] warrenny: Tbf systems is overused as a complaint
[4:50:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Borrowed power can be fun, true
[4:50:19] chaostheory8907: @tdpark_ Hour and a half
[4:50:24] Ballsonfire_: oh for sure
[4:50:24] squidward_tentacles33: squidward_tentacles33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! 9.2 hype! towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:50:27] Buckwink: corruption was fun dont fucking at me
[4:50:28] kyshen3: Yea but it should be interesting also..
[4:50:31] kyshen3: stat procs are not fun
[4:50:35] Masqerader: Only system i liked for borrowed power was artifact weapons,  hoping for weapons is such a pain in the ass
[4:50:36] Maxoru0: @RealSolaroid oh no! lol
[4:50:40] drozie: imo they recycle to much content look at 9.1 it was an invasion on the maw. 8.1 was an invasion 7.1 was an invasion. last 3 expansion have been dog
[4:50:41] PrimalRain: I want permanent talents and shit too
[4:50:41] Miklagard: I miss the rogue artifact weapon trait that negated all fall dmg  rooFeels
[4:50:42] Ballsonfire_: @Poondog nein
[4:50:43] SSD511_: Missing bfa farming
[4:50:47] N3llee: borrowed power isnt a bad thing. How blizz implements is bad.
[4:50:52] zanis_: Define Borrowed Power
[4:50:54] kw3nk: oh heck no. Gimme a new talent row
[4:50:55] Molvonos: Honestly, I feel that WoW could do well with Everquest's AA system.  Small incrimental increases throughout expansions to make every little bit of XP missed count.
[4:50:56] RobinDePoppin: Everybody likes zones, raids, dungeons and a new class. Seems like it could be easy to make a good expansion.
[4:51:02] AIphaSwift: needs a calamity Kappa
[4:51:04] slothlovechunk11: I hate borrowed power
[4:51:05] LoSuns: LoSuns subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 123 months, currently on a 123 month streak! towLets towGo towHAMUP

[4:51:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's like with that Azerite armor, it had fun and cool things but they fucked it up at the start
[4:51:27] Nemesis_: holy 123 months
[4:51:29] Rexialiton: Holy poggers
[4:51:33] Celestia6: towHAMUP
[4:51:34] Ribastur0075: interesting, most ppl want less external systems.
[4:51:38] Mockle: I dont like when borrowed power consists of procs and shit... it's fine if game mechanics are changed
[4:51:38] LekeroleN: LoSuns just as easy as 123 Kappa
[4:51:39] chaostheory8907: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:51:40] Thoreya: @rad_bard hour and a half
[4:51:41] kyshen3: Well azerite armor was so boring though
[4:51:42] warrenny: Would ppl hate it if there was no borrowed power?
[4:51:43] zanis_: @PrimalRain what are those systems borrowing from
[4:51:43] Havykk: @Towelliee I understand the need for borrowed power, but something needs to move forward, besides the 10 lvls, wheres the character development?
[4:51:46] a23pk: a23pk1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 45 months baby! Let's get it!!! HAMMERS UP
[4:51:46] mmrghost7: they give TD back i will play shadowlands everyday all day :P
[4:51:48] lithium364: what if 9.2 will be the lost Patch of WoD? with shattrath raid LUL
[4:51:48] Thoreya: essences were cool too!
[4:51:49] RealSolaroid: I thought corruptions were cool but the rotation in the corruption vendor made it not cool
[4:51:50] RobinDePoppin: Still prefer Tier Sets
[4:51:50] 5rooms: @rad_bard in 1.5h
[4:51:51] Sollice: BfA had shitty armor design
[4:51:52] Ballsonfire_: it feels like every expansion is a 1 year and a half beta
[4:51:52] SteveSD: COPIUM
[4:51:53] MexicanMisker: 8.3 was the peak experience, so much fun
[4:51:57] SteveSD: ;p
[4:51:59] Buckwink: bfa was fun people just hate because they quit early
[4:52:00] cRUSSIANthegame: except the Power RNG rolls you got
[4:52:01] amartian52: Is WoW officially back?
[4:52:01] HexaDroid: respeccing sucked
[4:52:02] Zakali: @Towelliee i just hated corruptions so much.
[4:52:05] N3llee: we'll agree to disagree that it was terrible
[4:52:11] UltimaWeap: I don't know whats more impressive Losuns being subbed for that long or Towelliee streaming for this long
[4:52:13] ninetynil: 5.4 = GOAT
[4:52:14] mmrghost7: TD can save this expansion atleast for tanks :D
[4:52:16] Gruffian: Bring back Twilight Devastation
[4:52:24] Shrenko: Im just tired of all these systems that is gone and irrelevant in the next expansion
[4:52:24] PrimalRain: zanis_ it's a temporary power increase. instead of permanent like talents and class skills
[4:52:24] amartian52: Sadge
[4:52:24] fowlentv: 8.2 was one of the best patches imo
[4:52:26] Masqerader: Twilight Devastation is king
[4:52:28] Ballsonfire_: it wasnt fun in pvp let me tell you
[4:52:29] Buckwink: corruption was fun as hell
[4:52:31] im_capy: start bad, when subs drop, release better is the blizz way
[4:52:33] Ballsonfire_: fuck corruption in pvp
[4:52:33] Thoreya: corruption was cool until you played a lock in pvp and chaos bolted u in 1.3 seconds
[4:52:33] EndureZg: towBeer towPog
[4:52:34] Ribastur0075: i hated corruption, to much rng.
[4:52:34] Mattsta: corruption sucked
[4:52:35] zanis_: @PrimalRain I see I see
[4:52:35] Thoreya: that was so cancer
[4:52:37] Kromede: took me forever to get a TD3 peace
[4:52:39] ProfJeffs: Corruption gear super fun but started out bad @towelliee
[4:52:39] Riproarin999: i loved corruption too, being able to make crazy builds in wow was fun
[4:52:40] Jollywhompus: RIP Tank top DPS meta hahaha
[4:52:42] SquidSosa: they said fuck it with corruptions
[4:52:42] holy_one: holy_one converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[4:52:44] Sollice: @Towelliee WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR WE GET CORRUPTION BACK in 9.2 FROM A NOT DEAD NZOTH TO FIGHT JAILER
[4:52:45] PToastman: towLets towStop
[4:52:46] SilkeySmooth: corruption was better then the broken covenant abilities that we got
[4:52:47] druidiful: corruption would have been good if we could buy it form the start and it wasnt rotating
[4:52:48] Pjh81216: no one want to grind out a ton of sets
[4:52:49] Masqerader: @Towelliee nothing better than going into vision and 1 shotting a boss on 5mans
[4:52:49] RobinDePoppin: I think u are corrupted KEKW
[4:52:51] rymerre: corruption was garbage for pvp
[4:52:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: The corruption vendor rotation was the biggest fuckup with that
[4:52:53] LoSuns: I've been watching @Towelliee since Justin.tv
[4:52:54] kyletalkss: TRUE
[4:52:56] Throdio: If they took away the RNG of it, I think people would of loved it a lot more.
[4:52:57] Xailen: Corruption was added too late in the game, it was fun
[4:52:57] mmrghost7: agreed
[4:52:58] Thoreya: locks with haste corruption in pvp......disgusting
[4:52:58] wickedmgg: it was so much FUN
[4:53:00] N3llee: I thought we were against cancer in this channel? Corruption was pure cancer
[4:53:01] luckfore: it was broken
[4:53:01] Masqerader: 5mask
[4:53:01] donol: It was perfect at the end of the expansion because it was OP and just fun to blast things towards then end
[4:53:03] flebbooo: Corruption was really fun, just sucks we didn't have it around for a long time
[4:53:04] Reckless_Monk: TD went hard
[4:53:05] ThaOriginalGamester: Full Vers DH in PVP LUL
[4:53:05] Throdio: The Kiss/Curse thing was so cool
[4:53:05] Molvonos: @Sollice I hate you a little bit for even typing that.  lol
[4:53:07] Putcride: @Towelliee my only regret with bfa is not lvling a mage for corruption
[4:53:09] Ribastur0075: it was gross in pvp tho pretty annoying
[4:53:09] a23pk: a23pk1 is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 115 in the channel!

[4:53:13] a23pk: a23pk1 gifted a Tier 1 sub to zanis_! 
[4:53:16] Ballsonfire_: and get one shoted by a twillight dev in pvp is not fun
[4:53:19] Ballsonfire_: unhealable
[4:53:19] Sollice: @Molvonos If I call it right you pay me 5$
[4:53:24] Rexialiton: and had like 120 corruption lol
[4:53:25] zanis_: @PrimalRain and why are people against those types of powers?  Seems like's it's a new way to play keeping content fresh ?
[4:53:27] N3llee: @Towelliee I thought we were against cancer in this channel? Corruption was pure cancer
[4:53:27] Molvonos: @Sollice You're on!

[4:53:43] PToastman: danPanic
[4:53:44] Pjh81216: grinding out more than 3 sets of gear is aids
[4:53:44] SdRayM: after playing lost ark wow feels even more boring now :P
[4:53:45] druidiful: i really miss vengeance as a tank
[4:53:45] koocco: i love that infinte star on mythic raids it was crazy
[4:53:47] xxxwaxyxxx: idk vengence tanking was fun
[4:53:49] Ortinoth: borrowed power i am 100% against
[4:53:52] d1stract10n: no
[4:53:53] Hypertitan: Hypertitan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 120 months, currently on a 120 month streak! this 120 notification actually makes me feel old.........
[4:53:53] PCGScorpion: so whats the accouncement or didnt it happen yet
[4:53:54] Zakali: Nope
[4:53:54] Buckwink: fuck I miss bfa
[4:53:55] gold9871: yup
[4:53:58] Thoreya: legion had borrowed power and the expansion was lit
[4:53:59] sylvosis: no
[4:54:02] Masqerader: no
[4:54:04] Thoreya: borrowed power if its good is fine
[4:54:04] Sollice: What no why would i pay him for something that clearly isnt going to happen. I am throwing out wild ideas and should be rewarded if I am right
[4:54:06] Ribastur0075: so if you like these systems, what was your problem with sl? less content?
[4:54:14] KingSlayerYotam: towell did you get the new cat mount from the store?
[4:54:18] LekeroleN: Hypertitan You old Kappa
[4:54:22] ThaOriginalGamester: i had a blast in BFA
[4:54:24] PrimalRain: zanis_ I'd rather a mix of borrowed and still gaining permanent powers myself. but can see how it can be a pain to balance and eventually lead to pruning
[4:54:39] Ballsonfire_: Snoreghast
[4:54:42] donol: @Towelliee New 9.1.5 feature Cosmetics are used up
[4:54:47] Hypertitan: i am actually old...but that's fine haha
[4:54:48] Soraoblivian: so like WOD
[4:54:51] KRAVIN0FF: i unsubbed, to boring
[4:54:53] Ribastur0075: agree korthia is horrible
[4:55:03] RobinDePoppin: probably wouldve been good if they launched 9.1 sooner and ended earlier.
[4:55:06] zanis_: @PrimalRain I think I would fall into the same bucket.  Thanks for taking the time to explain that.
[4:55:09] raptorstrick: raptorstrick extended their Tier 1 subscription through January! 
[4:55:17] PrimalRain: zanis_ no problem SeemsGood
[4:55:18] Gotxiko: korthia felt like 9.0 endgame instead of a new 9.1 content
[4:55:22] Fight_Monkey: Legion pvp... i miss u <3
[4:55:23] Pathoren: Pathoren subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[4:55:24] Dein95: Anima is just not fun to farm really.
[4:55:24] tonyr23: tonyr23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[4:55:24] Sollice: Problem I have with borrowed power is it only lasts one expansion. And it normally takes it until .2 or .3 patches for it to be good lol
[4:55:33] amartian52: the feels
[4:55:35] Molvonos: If they introduce Stardew Valley into FFXIV, i'm done with anything else.  Viva la Farming
[4:55:42] atamala: titanforging, reforging, and gem sockets need to come back - and more enchants
[4:55:45] Pjh81216: thats because you play games for an income
[4:55:45] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Collecting stuff is true endgame than.
[4:55:46] zanis_: @a23pk1  thanks bud!!!
[4:55:46] Ribastur0075: but that what ppl asked for tho
[4:55:49] Kelticlore: there has to be an end to grinds
[4:55:52] d1stract10n: no
[4:55:53] dmv_luke: they really need to try and do garrisons right
[4:55:56] zandiklili: love seeing you in wow again
[4:55:56] Grinds: Yeah fuck grinds
[4:55:57] Aidler: dead as a theme is not exciting
[4:55:57] kyshen3: I think that may have something to do with also making money while doing it lol
[4:55:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: i like to be done so i have time to play other games between raids
[4:56:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked Titanforging, but yeah trying to min-max that wrecked some people
[4:56:02] LekeroleN: WoW isn't even AS grindy as other MMOs though..
[4:56:10] a23pk: @zanis_ no worries!!!!!!
[4:56:24] cRUSSIANthegame: did you get to 10/10 M before quitting @Towelliee ?
[4:56:33] lithium364: allied race is printing money
[4:56:37] arthurthas: its because of "player meaningful choice" --Ion
[4:56:57] lithium364: i hope for kyrian myself, the whole "but Lore" is out of the window anyway this expension
[4:57:07] BJofBorg: I think an issue that was beyond their control was a depressing, almost colorless expansion during a depressing time in the world.
[4:57:21] Fight_Monkey: are the allied races still content locked? Thats surprising
[4:57:25] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee aint a myffic raider anymore :'( sadge
[4:57:36] kyshen3: It's not..
[4:57:37] cRUSSIANthegame: This tier isn't super satisfying to prog tbh.
[4:57:42] kyshen3: Just doesn't feel good to do it
[4:57:44] LekeroleN: Raid with subs towWipe Kappa
[4:57:47] lithium364: @BJofBorg very true
[4:57:54] Buckwink: bfa raids were better
[4:58:01] D3m0nHunt3r666: Feels great to have time without raiding
[4:58:03] abra_dh: @towelliee have you seen the fractal post on mmochamp? Hint for 9.2
[4:58:05] sinlesssinner: i think the last good raid was the Jaina one
[4:58:09] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee I liked the fights though, maybe not the theme.
[4:58:09] MexicanMisker: amen, super boying
[4:58:10] D3m0nHunt3r666: Sanctum was trash
[4:58:13] MexicanMisker: boring*
[4:58:16] valianya: Since Legion they've been repeating the same basic formula to try to repeat the success of Legion.  AP borrowed power you chargge up all expansion and then discard, Legendary items that grant new abilities, time gated questlines that drip feed lore, instanced solo repeatable challenge, new zones with new factions rep grind currency rares, WQs that are time sinks that lose fun value the more you do them, side story raid tier, etc
[4:58:22] Buckwink: I quit during mythic sylv prog, not having fun with the state of the game
[4:58:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they say layer 9 for renown
[4:58:29] dmv_luke: mythic raiding is more stressful than rewarding
[4:58:30] LekeroleN: NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN Kappa
[4:58:30] Choderz: Choderz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months, currently on a 54 month streak! ayyyyy
[4:58:32] nitrix01: how much longer for 9.2 info?
[4:58:33] zanis_: Max was saying this teir was meh
[4:58:36] Ribastur0075: bfa raids were awesome ye,
[4:58:41] kindofwackyy: I kinda Miss Eternal palace
[4:58:43] magemaster225: layer 9 is the easiest, but with your renown, youll have better chances if you do 11
[4:58:47] Buckwink: painsmith was hard but not fun
[4:58:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1 hour 20 minutes until announcement
[4:58:49] Bissenz: I just want to go back and relive MoP and legion
[4:58:51] dmv_luke: Mythic NYA was awesome
[4:58:54] Rowini30: @nitrix01 1hr 20 min
[4:58:59] Firelordxsrx: Guess whos back!
[4:59:00] Velkhan: PLus the gearing is weird with M+ being WAAAY BETTER
[4:59:01] Buckwink: painsmith was literally waiting around for the same two people to survive long enough to kill
[4:59:03] Firelordxsrx: Back again
[4:59:07] Fight_Monkey: Legion was great, even the mount grinds were good
[4:59:08] woodnf: painsmith ez.  fatescribe yuck
[4:59:11] amartian52: They’re making content for kids that didn’t experience the epic content now rip
[4:59:17] teodor4o: nooo we wana see 9
[4:59:17] dmv_luke: WoD raids were great too
[4:59:23] Buckwink: mythic fatescribe is the best fight in the raid dont at me
[4:59:23] kindofwackyy: how much renown do you get per run?
[5:00:07] magemaster225: since everyone was taking a break, bellular finally had time to announce his game
[5:00:09] d1stract10n: M+ needs a revamp imo
[5:00:13] kindofwackyy: YESSSSS
[5:00:16] magakigr: are you planning on returning to wow if 9.2 is good?
[5:00:22] Buckwink: I liked Uldir
[5:00:29] MeisterPetze: remove it
[5:00:33] Shrenko: like GW2 Fractals
[5:00:34] Veyronn_00: I loved Uldir
[5:00:34] Velkhan: Gearing in raiding should be the best way for PVE. Love M+ but the  gear is waaay better than the raid one (outside the shit shards)
[5:00:35] Eraste: ya, remove it, lol
[5:00:37] Buckwink: bfa dungeons were more fun too
[5:00:37] ZavrocKk: lets play another game!
[5:00:38] lithium364: uldir was fun zuul cleaving in like maniacs sadge
[5:00:41] Sovanos: was there an annoucment allready or ?
[5:00:41] Gotxiko: taking out timers and putting in torghast ranking system
[5:00:42] Valvax: rermove time lol
[5:00:45] GhostShaman: remove it and go back to MOP challenge modes...
[5:00:47] Masqerader: Tyrannical is piss easy now
[5:00:49] zanis_: Is the mmo-population considered accurate ?
[5:00:49] valianya: They need far more casual content that is fun without being a chore and isn't mandatory for power
[5:00:49] Zettabyte: Affixes PepeHands
[5:00:50] SilkeySmooth: i cant progress in m+ because i dont have a phone
[5:00:54] jeffnsteff2019: LFR was biggiest mistake wow did
[5:00:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: doing the same mythic + again each raid tier to get the same gear again is just annoying to me and I rather not do it
[5:00:56] Mattsta: I would like if m+ was stock based instead of time based
[5:00:57] PrimalRain: make it not based on time maybe
[5:00:57] RobinDePoppin: Mythic plus ranked with Gold, Platinum & Diamond. And you have auto queue for people that want it KEKW @Towelliee
[5:01:00] Havykk: M+ ResidentSleeper
[5:01:00] Gruffian: Tyrannical is good now!
[5:01:01] RobinDePoppin: Yea
[5:01:03] BaxGamin: i miss wow, but i feel like i never get anywhere with the game
[5:01:06] Gotxiko: yep, points for time, for clear %...etc
[5:01:10] Eraste: M+ needs positive affixes, choose your own key level/dungeon, etc
[5:01:10] UltimaWeap: hear me out solo dungeons
[5:01:12] kindofwackyy: tyrannical and bolstering from fortified
[5:01:13] Gotxiko: dmg received...
[5:01:16] lithium364: i kinda dont want them to double on torghast again, its gonna get removed next expansion anyway
[5:01:21] Gotxiko: and put a leaderboard
[5:01:25] RobinDePoppin: make mythic + a shooter

[5:01:38] Sovanos: was there an annoucment?
[5:01:43] LordxSaura: how is pvp in wow now?
[5:01:44] Eraste: incentivize lesser player dungeons somehow
[5:01:50] Gotxiko: 2 leggos for sure
[5:01:50] luckfore: Blizz closing the 9.1.5 PTR forums Hmmmm
[5:01:51] Eraste: played*
[5:01:58] noisebringer: hoow long till annoucment ?
[5:01:59] albertocofi: So basically QoL changes to mythic+ and we gucci
[5:02:04] Rytten: Remove renown
[5:02:08] albertocofi: and removal of tyranical
[5:02:13] gillgamesh_gaming: hmmm WoW you done with NW then?
[5:02:26] Mattsta: 1hr15mins
[5:02:29] Gotxiko: m+ just needs the enough changes so that its not frustrating if someone leaves or you wipe once
[5:03:22] Gotxiko: but it does in people's minds
[5:03:37] Mustage: Mustage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! Hammers UP
[5:03:42] Crystalyzee: idk what groups you guys get into but its very easy to time keys with ppl dieing 15 times as long as you are all pumping
[5:03:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they need to fix M+ so that it doesn't creat toxicity...don't let people ruin keys
[5:04:23] Corgi_Bark: Does anyone know when the announcement takes place? So I can tactically schedule a work break
[5:04:33] Crystalyzee: i can't remember the last time i actually failed a key since they nerfed literally every dungeon in SL
[5:04:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1 hour 15 minutes until announcement

[5:04:48] Velkhan: @Corgi_Bark Not sure man i wanna know aswell
[5:04:54] Molvonos: I loathed the fact they separated Fortified and Tyrannical for KSM.  For just a reskinned mount.
[5:04:57] Velkhan: @weirdo_dude Thanks!
[5:05:00] BreadDorito: might be an unpopular opinion but I feel like m+ could really be popular if the dungeons were just smaller.  Every DOS m+ run feels like a chore to play, and also it sucks when you RIP a key like 30 seconds after timer expires
[5:05:20] Molvonos: What they should have done was swap the PvE and PvP mounts with the recolors.  It'd have been far more incentive for both sides.
[5:05:23] lithium364: i hope they add the maldraxxus hydra mounts for us to use finally
[5:05:36] Epidoral: Is there a new video already ?
[5:05:38] Streamcrush: I'm not a fan of timed dungeons. I just want challenging dungeons that I can queue for.

[5:06:20] Odinslayer: dont want to be a doom sayer here but tbh 9.2 wont be that amazing
[5:06:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: The one WoW dev talked about how time can be a measure of skill, but I don't like being rushed
[5:06:45] flebbooo: Damn u already played it Odin?
[5:06:46] Maxoru0: I don't think failing a key is an issue, I meant it's no different then wiping a 1,000 times to the same boss.
[5:06:49] cryft: if they nerf venthyr mistweaver into the ground i might resub
[5:06:51] Velkhan: Its probably going to be somethign pretty meh as always. Shards 2.0 with more NRG

[5:07:22] Masqerader: Tyrannical feels really good atm @Towelliee  for mythic + new rotations some of the fort ones are pure aids, like bolstering on a fort week
[5:07:23] luckfore: Blizz closing the 9.1.5 PTR forums now bluepost on it @Towelliee
[5:07:25] spiked16: how long till announcment ?
[5:07:29] Ballsonfire_: our expectations of 9.2 are so low at this point we can only go up , right ? cope
[5:07:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: Jack and Copium Kappa
[5:07:35] donol: The frustration with Mythic + is that the only way to get anything that is valuable is doing 15's for the week and then you are getting a chance at an upgrade as long as you don't get something you already have. It's stupid that you don't get rewards from directly running the dungeon. Just the weekly chest. Also the super power of Raid gems means that last week I didn't upgrade a 226 helm for a 252 because I would loose the socket and do less damage.

[5:07:56] soysos91: I remember this game
[5:07:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: The huge Lich King statue is truly epic
[5:08:00] mavericks312: the LK statue was massive
[5:08:04] Odinslayer: no i didn't play it, but been playing shadowlands so far and i didn't quit.. and if there still be renown farm/new zone like korthia to farm shit in/rep gated behind sockets and conduit upgrades then 9.2 will be same as 9.1 and it will suck
[5:08:06] Maxoru0: @donol right!
[5:08:06] snowmang94: this guy getting smashed at 8:00am i respect the fuck out of that

[5:17:49] strungoutlv: remove normal raids
[5:17:54] baaronthemonk: with the possible ability to raid together between factions, wouldn't that open the possibility of making another faction?
[5:17:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe it
[5:17:58] valianya: Dragon Isles with Ysera and Wrathion and Kalecgos and Alexstrasza and Nozdormu and more about Infinite flight

[5:18:26] gfvaris: WHY not let us do molten core lvl 20 40 ppl that would be fun
[5:18:26] 3663Sharad: towTinfoil towTinfoil
[5:18:28] Pjh81216: playerbase always loved the challenge modes/mage tower, dont know why they never kept doing it
[5:18:30] BLARGO_: Like 14?
[5:18:30] fletch8: HE KNOWS
[5:18:32] murphyb913: can you explain it
[5:18:33] Throdio: Old school Blizzard was great at taking other games ideas and putting a Blizzard spin on them
[5:18:40] kindofwackyy: I wish they looked at swtor's version of that too.. they have been able to get gear in old raids for several xpacks
[5:18:42] SanusSangria: I've been asking for something like that for a long time now.
[5:18:42] Custodiss: how fare are we from the 9.2 thing?
[5:18:45] Jalham: Its easy content forever if they did that
[5:18:48] Rexialiton: The prophet knows!
[5:18:49] DuhCasual: Huh?
[5:18:50] zandiklili: I loved throne of thunder
[5:18:50] pavepawns: i wouldnt wanna do dorumu again tho
[5:18:51] mcgrady240: old content is just a waste, it would be so cool to do it again
[5:18:52] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee DOnt make me cry
[5:18:53] fletch8: 1 hr
[5:18:54] VrtniPatuljak: make 10 buttons like GW
[5:18:56] Choderz: when is the announcement?
[5:18:59] L4dy_Renegade: Probable actual 9.2 announcement: The cover up of women paintings in the game to not show cleavage or anything "suggestive" is actually finished. KEKW
[5:18:59] jamarky23: I disagree... Why not put more emphasis on new and fresh content?
[5:19:01] mavericks312: nobody steals and uses others ideas better then blizzard
[5:19:06] BLARGO_: Do timewalking but actually good
[5:19:07] Odinslayer: wrath
[5:19:08] Rexialiton: @Choderz in 1h
[5:19:09] BLARGO_: so*
[5:19:10] Gathilo: So like FFXIV
[5:19:11] Ballsonfire_: mop Kreygasm
[5:19:12] Perseus_IRL: 1 hour from now... HYPE!
[5:19:13] smashwow: thought they did some of that in TW before?
[5:19:14] Gotxiko: mount droprates form that content to be bit higher than legacy
[5:19:17] UltimaWeap: its sort of Timewalking but not
[5:19:17] albertocofi: @Towelliee Old content with old abilities, like bring back mind spike?
[5:19:18] Ballsonfire_: i miss mop so much
[5:19:22] xhaven: thats one thing i hope they do not copy over I prefer dungeons how they are
[5:19:23] Nurd6: Competition always brought out the best in wow
[5:19:24] Soraoblivian: i actrully liked mop
[5:19:25] fletch8: NAXX OUT
[5:19:25] Kelticlore: IMO Timewalking should last a month
[5:19:25] Choderz: @Rexialiton ty!
[5:19:25] rymerre: yeah thats just a band-aid...its basically retail-classic
[5:19:28] Mitune: or maybe poll the community on what raids to focus on if they do prior to MoP
[5:19:28] cryft: im getting sick of "doesnt matter just cosmetic" content
[5:19:29] RobinDePoppin: I would be addicted
[5:19:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: It does sound good
[5:19:29] Kinghorn: players cant handle timewalking raids
[5:19:32] mavericks312: he knows
[5:19:36] SanusSangria: Updated weapon and armor models for old things would be really cool and getting them through that system would be a good way to implement it
[5:19:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: Death knight zones into molten core and they just become a warrior LUL
[5:19:37] Rexialiton: @Choderz np :)
[5:19:38] valianya: No start with BfA then go Backwards
[5:19:38] Collected1: MrGM says new covenant
[5:19:39] Valvax: and ad xmog to it
[5:19:40] wizlordherbie: @jamarky23 because new and fresh content becomes old and dead content quick.
[5:19:41] Gotxiko: i hope
[5:19:42] BreadDorito: In prepatch- watching sodapoppin's team trying to clear WOTLK raids at lvl 30 was really cool and fun to watch
[5:19:43] TheGaoSora: Oh I thought it was in this hour man i hate timezones :(
[5:19:46] kindofwackyy: I hope they keep M+ and add more contnet

[5:19:58] PrimalRain: that would be great
[5:19:58] Mitune: Gotta update the casual saide of things for sure
[5:19:59] Pjh81216: WoW needs to get rid of dungeon guide book and 90% of addons
[5:20:03] Rulem: keep m+ but maybe scrap the affixes
[5:20:05] xhaven: I love M+ do not want it to go away
[5:20:05] FranciscoTheMage: to be FAIR they have a SHITLOAD of content to give us to do again
[5:20:05] nitrix01: when is 9.2 news dropping?

[5:20:18] Rexialiton: it was
[5:20:18] kaeildk: @Towelliee yeah FFXVI reusability of old content is what WoW is missing, the old content is getting obsolete to fast in WoW
[5:20:18] Odinslayer: what do you mean no echo?
[5:20:19] HaloS23: @Towelliee you think they are looking at New Worlds prof system?
[5:20:21] xhaven: watch maybe but to play no thanks
[5:20:21] BLARGO_: this is why timewalking should always be on, and timewalking events should award better rewards
[5:20:22] Gildvor: a wise man said once: you shouldn't ride a dead horse (like old contant in wow)
[5:20:26] godpwer: hour
[5:20:26] Wcvechten: It also allows people that never got to experience it properly to do so, to some degree
[5:20:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1 hour until announcement
[5:20:31] KingSlayerYotam: farming old raids in wow sucks after new scaling, hope they address that somehow
[5:20:34] Maxoru0: yeah, that would a great improvement for long term play, during droughts of new content.
[5:20:36] Mitune: I mean they need more in general @VelzenTV not just those things
[5:20:41] alamonav: WOOO i thought i missed it
[5:20:44] RobinDePoppin: @Mitune ya
[5:20:48] Rytten: omgomg im so hyped
[5:20:54] Rytten: :D
[5:20:55] kaeildk: @Towelliee yeah FFXVI reusability of old content is what WoW is missing, the old content is getting obsolete to fast in WoW
[5:20:57] BLARGO_: Did the Brawler's Guild open back up yet?
[5:20:58] f1qck: pepeD
[5:20:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it needs to be a choice and not forced
[5:21:00] evercl3armkii: no echo??
[5:21:03] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee would this be for chromie.. some kind of chromie time
[5:21:04] 3663Sharad: What does "noe echo" mean?
[5:21:08] Odinslayer: what do you mean with no echo?
[5:21:08] flebbooo: i would love to necomers to wow come and try doing things like icc or throne of thunder or something on a proper diffuctulity for a first time
[5:21:09] bowefasa: agreed fersure @kaeildk
[5:21:09] gfvaris: wow doesnt have echo :D

[5:21:20] Eraste: Determination
[5:21:22] Mattsta: the echo in ffxiv is like the lfr buff you get after wiping a few times
[5:21:23] leronTTT: no systems for wow Pog

[5:21:27] baaronthemonk: NO MO FOMO!
[5:21:28] VrtniPatuljak: 10.0 sounds like the jesus patch
[5:21:28] denflup: Pog
[5:21:30] wickedmgg: dont like FF though
[5:21:33] Mitune: The biggest issue is the barrowed power which heavily influenced balancing and design for alot of those. They can make it work, but it is a barrier @Towelliee
[5:21:39] 3663Sharad: @Mattsta ty
[5:21:45] bansalt: borrowed power is ruining this game
[5:21:46] HaloS23: what does "no echo" mean?
[5:21:47] KPable: I think with the new leadership and stuff wow is going to make a huge turn for the better.
[5:21:48] L4dy_Renegade: Sylvanas gets cancelled. Kappa
[5:21:48] turboloveman: Wow is dead i am so sorry about this.İ was playing only wow and i am so boring these days
[5:21:50] Rytten: I dont like borrowed powers replacing talents
[5:21:53] Toskens: Titanforging kinda gave you a little extra to play for imo.
[5:21:55] darkh79: they also need currencies like ff14 has with duties - that also makes end game players queue up for older stuff
[5:21:57] gfvaris: been playing for a long time first time hearing about determination
[5:21:59] BLARGO_: So Brawler's Guild coming in 9.2 or 9.2.5?
[5:22:04] shinta__: you can only use normal shit
[5:22:07] 3663Sharad: correct
[5:22:10] Rulem: I would love to see Mythic raids become a min ilvl system; standardize gear and balance around that
[5:22:10] luckfore: yep everything is disabled
[5:22:10] shinta__: all legendaries are dsiabled
[5:22:13] Rexialiton: I dont necessarily want it. But Character Boost is 60 now in 9.2
[5:22:14] Odinslayer: @Mattsta LFR has a buff? O_O
[5:22:34] rymerre: im not a fan of rereleasing old content simply because they cant think of anything else
[5:22:34] Rexialiton: KEKW
[5:22:36] emilools: i think its a totally waste of content how all dung / raid content prior to current exp is basically just running through an instance
[5:22:37] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[5:22:37] RunningOutOfRAM: LMFAO NEWWORLD KEKW
[5:22:38] KingSlayerYotam: it will sucks for most, cov ability is so far in the rotation some classes will fill empty
[5:22:39] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee but wait. mage tower won't be the mage tower we know with the use of the legion artifact?
[5:22:52] fletch8: LUL
[5:22:57] Valvax: i beblieve i can fly!
[5:23:00] Vch001: "Hold on now"
[5:23:01] GhostShaman: How bad is the catch up for flying now?
[5:23:01] The_Loony_Bin: Even since flying, Revendreth is my favorite zone
[5:23:02] FranciscoTheMage: but thats how we did it

[5:23:17] The_Loony_Bin: I heard eonar is stil hard too
[5:23:17] death_cam_: bfa has legacy loot aswell
[5:23:18] Moonphire: No
[5:23:19] emilools: not KJ
[5:23:22] fletch8: yes
[5:23:23] BLARGO_: KJ is fine yeah
[5:23:24] luckfore: they just tweaked some abillities, no damage tuning or so
[5:23:27] emilools: or yea u can if u are a god
[5:23:30] Odinslayer: you can solo eonar and aggramar
[5:23:30] ElphyrTomei: Eonar is piss easy
[5:23:30] magemaster225: KJ sucks, eonr still sucks, you cant solo anything from before that was hard
[5:23:31] Riproarin999: kj is easy now yes
[5:23:31] SSD511_: Yes all good
[5:23:32] fletch8: you can slol it now

[5:23:40] HaloS23: did heroic they other day, havent tried mythic
[5:23:40] TyrantExile: always wanted to get into wow but feel like i missed too much in the beginning
[5:23:44] magemaster225: eonar is still busted on mythic
[5:23:44] luckfore: tweaked
[5:23:50] Masqerader: ya they tweaked shit, but didn't add legacy damage to legion content
[5:23:54] BLARGO_: KJ is fine to solo now, these people haven't played since the update KEKW
[5:23:54] MeisterPetze: yes
[5:23:55] Moonphire: You have to have a very high Ilvl for mythic Tomb and up
[5:23:56] Hitokiri83: guldan is easy

[5:23:59] wizlordherbie: I'd been clearing ToS every week before patch, didn't notice a differnce
[5:23:59] The_Tacozilla: yea he is much easier
[5:23:59] rohdey: doable
[5:24:01] Masqerader: Gul'dan has always been easy
[5:24:01] Odinslayer: yea guldan is easy
[5:24:06] IronPhalanX: the orb that knock u drop slower
[5:24:10] Masqerader: 220 + was soloable
[5:24:16] HAMMERRAZOR: @towelliee the balls drop slower on kj, guldans been soloable for a while
[5:24:29] ArthurianNZ: yeah, but it's still not 2 shots and they're dead, you just don't take damage really. Eonar is still tight though.
[5:24:30] MessyZerg: no stuns on guldan
[5:24:31] pavepawns: guldan they fixed a while ago
[5:24:33] Mattsta: i think they just changed all of the hard no-solo abilities...like that trio boss near the end of antorus where you have to keep them seperated
[5:24:44] TyrantExile: what are bad reasons @6L4CK1C3
[5:24:51] Moonphire: My 210 mage gets wrecked first boss in Tomb on mythic, they didn't nerf any HP , it's just a matter of ilvl
[5:24:53] BLARGO_: yeah Armageddon doesn't destroy you anymore, and the darkness phase is piss easy now
[5:24:58] HAMMERRAZOR: eonar is still a pain in the ass
[5:25:05] Shrenko: its not a Stream @Towelliee its a video
[5:25:11] Odinslayer: they say its not a stream but a video they will drop

[5:25:21] fistofnature: im glad they stopped scaling the world up to our new itlvl every patch
[5:25:22] luckfore: they have done that for past patches too
[5:25:22] Creakydoors: LUL blizz
[5:25:22] netc0dex: they do all their events on youtube
[5:25:24] Jarlan23: Blizzard still has a deal with twitch. they signed it for owl and it applies to their other shit
[5:25:24] Viysol: I thought that Youtube was where they did all their broadcasting now.

[5:25:43] bowefasa: Started on twitch but then bounced out
[5:25:46] Daggerstry: Probably because all big WoW twitch streamers quit for 6 months lol
[5:25:50] godpwer: it was the valorant beta key

[5:26:21] darqsat: Why did you leave New World? Can you give a short answer?! Does it has a chance to restore interest of gamers?
[5:26:23] Jalham: youtube content creators quit too tho
[5:26:23] luck64_: yeah its weird seeing you on WoW again lol =D

[5:26:47] UltimaWeap: hot take: they want to keep the general audience away from the streamers for any negativity
[5:26:48] Kavieonn: Give WIldstar Its Flowers
[5:26:53] Subtlety_FL: Wildstar had so much potential, such a fun game

[5:52:22] Shrenko: @tebi1997 Im done with it.. maybe next expansion but for now Im playing other games. currently really addicted to gw2, playing like 16 hours a day when Im not at work xD
[5:53:04] Collected1: it needs a year or two and then a re-launch
[5:53:13] Jarlan23: @Towelliee did you watch nagurras wishlist for WoW? couple interesting things she listed on there
[5:53:15] fatNround: Elyon was the best
[5:53:22] Nebulizer87: GW2 is a damn gem
[5:53:24] blazyturtle: Elyon is fun as hell
[5:53:32] Shrenko: GW2 is my fav mmo right now
[5:53:33] mandilozano: gw2 is dope
[5:53:34] Miklagard: @Towelliee  will you play lost ark when it releases?
[5:53:36] Rulem: raids are fun in gw2 as well
[5:53:39] awkswow: gw also been out the longest
[5:53:40] MisterBongwater: big fan of gw2
[5:53:40] kingpoker: FF
[5:53:42] Rowini30: yeah gw2 is actually cool
[5:53:49] wigglinjigglin: lost ark is a banger
[5:53:51] djayfeel: been playing gw2 and elyon recently
[5:53:54] Genilort: dont understand why they dont update gw2
[5:53:55] Riproarin999: ive always kept up with gw2, imo its a great secondary mmo since you never fall behind gear wise
[5:54:01] tebbix: @Shrenko Same dude I've been playing FF for 3 months and it's refreshing, but I have that I still want WoW to be good and comeback
[5:54:02] blazyturtle: lost ark reminds me of an ARPG like diablo too much and it turns me off bigtime
[5:54:03] logic_fl: I want to see you try gw2 endgame some day. Think you will love raids
[5:54:07] Reckless_Monk: End of Dragons though
[5:54:08] mavericks312: ncsoft will never promote properly
[5:54:17] emznev: tbh i am more hyped for battlefield 2042 than anything else right now!
[5:54:20] Jarlan23: im trying to like FF but i just dislike the combat a lot. its boring
[5:54:22] xEskii: thats what happens when your eastern mobile shit makes 10x as much money
[5:54:24] maaswgrswerg: what mmo you think has the highest potential
[5:54:35] Disgruntledd: Was there a reason for the severe new world drop off from everyone?
[5:54:42] Sielu11628: I love watching LIVE streamer reactions to new content (any game). Have multiple tabs open
[5:54:43] Skrynor: I miss wildstar
[5:54:44] Rulem: I think, in the long run, Lost Ark will do the best
[5:54:46] eyemyor: What is this 9.2 announcement?
[5:54:48] Miklagard: guild wars 2 always runs like absolute dog poop on my pcs I had since it releases so that it wouldn't be fun to play it.
[5:54:49] KatieGaming: @Disgruntledd too many bugs for me
[5:54:49] Shrenko: @Towelliee they have been stepping up after you played GW2 with communication and advertisement for EoD.. they are getting alot of praise on reddit for it
[5:54:53] belfastcl: boring grindy core systems @Disgruntledd
[5:54:56] thMaxxx: @eyemyor when they announce it
[5:54:59] godpwer: @Disgruntledd  mage nerf haha
[5:55:01] Toojicle: As a new GW2 player, how easy is it to get into it? @Towelliee

[5:55:23] trinita299: L ARK L
[5:55:24] luckfore: meh i dont like click games
[5:55:28] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee i was shocked how smooth that click to move combat was. i was expecting the worst

[5:55:36] eldercandle: lost ark got the steeze
[5:55:37] BoiAtomico: lost ark's amazing
[5:55:43] ChidaRL: lost ark seems cool but i hated the controls
[5:55:47] eyemyor: Lost Ark looks good, will wait for launch to see.
[5:55:48] PastelByeol: Wish Ark had WASD keys for moving but I got used to the mouse use XD sorta haha
[5:55:49] DallTV_: sadly diddnet had the chance to play that much but that i tryed i liked
[5:55:54] wigglinjigglin: 100% YES
[5:55:56] bansalt: but didnt like it, I know people are sponsoring it, but It needs more to it. the diablo-like is questing is great but something is missing
[5:55:57] PastelByeol: LOL yep XD
[5:55:58] prewnas: true 100%
[5:55:59] Harshblue: I agree

[5:56:04] blazyturtle: yea i hate click to move
[5:56:05] trinita299: LO ARK L
[5:56:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe it, the controls matter
[5:56:12] xEskii: when you look at the numbers on Twitch for all of Riot's games, you must be excited for their upcoming MMO?
[5:56:18] Nevermolly: I mean 2ß22 may be Ahes of Creation but i guess there are far away from a beta testing xD
[5:56:21] Ezekyler: weeby AYAYABASS
[5:56:26] Bogzeh: crazy indeed, ppl never played arpgs i guess
[5:56:27] FranciscoTheMage: Riot has an MMO?
[5:56:27] Rulem: I am in that camp but I will still play it
[5:56:29] Kinghorn: feenAnime
[5:56:32] o__mj__o: its not that  hard to implement it based on how it plays
[5:56:32] PastelByeol: Cannot TELL you how many time I accidently button mash attacked tryin to move with WASD XD
[5:56:33] akia03: does it have a gacha system?
[5:56:34] Harshblue: just having the option to switch to WASD would be gold
[5:56:36] luckfore: 20min bois
[5:56:39] LekeroleN: Ye Riot is developing it, so it's a while
[5:56:42] Genius_Kappa: what is wasd?
[5:56:43] bansalt: Lost Ark is diablo with quests...
[5:56:46] TwoCenk: lost ark mostly feels like moba games like lol and dota.
[5:56:47] MysticRaven_: thats the one reason i dont play diablo or LoL cuz i cant use wasd
[5:56:48] byrdeen45: i use arrow keys never use aswd
[5:56:51] kashmara: I'm just glad we're being gifted with mmos. For a while it was just 987 looter shooters
[5:56:51] HaloS23: move keys on keyboard
[5:56:52] Ack___: @Towelliee morning Mr. Towel!
[5:56:53] Kedemel: But... that's not the control scheme it was designed for. So why would they implement that?
[5:56:55] PastelByeol: SAME
[5:57:06] o__mj__o: WASD and unlock camera
[5:57:09] Aegeanm: How does it feel going back to wow after trying other mmorpgs?
[5:57:09] LekeroleN: I think they'll base the graphics of the Arcane series to the MMO
[5:57:11] Reckless_Monk: lol Max was like 2026 for Riot. I bet his gf tells him little things here and there, seeing as she works at Riot
[5:57:13] xEskii: riot mmo is gunna pump the fanbase is so huge
[5:57:15] maaswgrswerg: legion classic is out by then
[5:57:16] SSD511_: Dreamhaven Kappa
[5:57:17] PastelByeol: Maybe just having an option to customize it to wasd? Idk like keys settingsa
[5:57:24] Genius_Kappa: @HaloS23 aaaah ty xD
[5:57:33] DustyWafflesOG: they made a post in their discord recently saying that a lot of elements are pretty far away from being ready for the Riot MMO so i expect were still a ways off
[5:57:33] Wotopi: i was surprised how challenging the abyssal dungeons were
[5:57:35] FranciscoTheMage: new Riot Concept .. an MMO without npc or quests .. just battling with cutscense
[5:57:40] futomara01: and also ZQSD
[5:57:42] soshiecho: soshiecho subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 22 month streak! 
[5:57:50] Rulem: I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a 3rd party system for WASD in that game

[5:58:16] Kisswani: I love the change in Torghast where sabing sould in here counts towards the 20 souls weekly
[5:58:17] xEskii: you know it will succeed because the new content is already out in other regions and doing well.
[5:58:18] axellent_x: as someone who hasn't looked much into lost ark what kind of "mmo content" does it have
[5:58:20] xaezoria: anyone know when 9.2 announcment is?
[5:58:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked the voice acting they did for NA, too
[5:58:29] tebbix: @Miklagard wait really ?
[5:58:29] Shrenko: @xaezoria_r in 20min
[5:58:36] PastelByeol: Second that question I left WoW a couple months ago and have since played alot of Betas and Games like NW, Lost Ark, Elyon ect and curious if it would be fun to go back or lacking? idk The monthly sub is what kills me for it rn

[6:36:56] serenabrooke: True, True
[6:36:57] GamerKillance: By the time 9.2 comes out FF14 will have their .1 patch AND expansion launch in that time. Thats just pitiful
[6:36:57] Malitor: ni hao ma?
[6:36:57] Daggerstry: Anyone else thinking they would use this with the whole "Eternity's End" as the end of WoW? After all, WoW has been the Eternal MMO
[6:37:00] verdant85: thats just a way to time gate
[6:37:01] TheGaoSora: The cypher thing better not be timegated...
[6:37:03] largefromage: stolen from NMS btw LUL
[6:37:06] Vch001: No Slyvannas
[6:37:07] cappei: Ask yourself this: can you tell which ''class'' set belongs to which class instantly? No, they look fucking generic and you can hardly tell. Those aren't class sets
[6:37:07] MortiousPrime: But in theory, we're just translating a language, which our characters ALREADY DO WHEN WE TALK TO NPCs

[6:37:14] abracka_: looks like i'm waiting until 10.0 to come back
[6:37:14] Dagomarus: I think the brightness, and lightness of the new zone is refreshing compared to the maw
[6:37:14] ReinholdtRanger: It has no cool new content? not even a brand new dungeon
[6:37:15] RandomSound: You can only decipher one Glyph a week
[6:37:15] Vch001: No Arthas

[6:37:19] ReinholdtRanger: So boring

[6:38:25] Dagomarus: Im betting we will have a item piece that we need to level up to resist domination like nzoths corruption legendary back piece
[6:38:30] Maxoru0: The raid and zone is what I like the most just from the video alone, but everything else is more of the same.
[6:38:31] Kedemel: If they are closing "Chapter 1" of World of Warcraft, does that mean 10.0 might be something of a revamp?
[6:38:31] Ballsonfire_: that looks nothing mystical
[6:38:34] Ballsonfire_: fucking trash

[6:43:20] cappei: I can't get over how awful these look. Pretty much zero class identity for 'class'' sets
[6:43:21] manmower: they said this is the last of the three parts of Shadowlands, and Shadowlands is the last chapter of the current WoW story
[6:43:21] MexicanMisker: good, get us out of SL and get us into 10.0.... lets move on boys
[6:43:23] serenabrooke: we trust and love and appreciation your knowledge

[6:43:59] Eran_21: now the question is do we have enough content on 9.2 until the next year
[6:43:59] RobinDePoppin: 10.0 looks not promising after this @Towelliee
[6:44:00] Royin2k3: this was a carrot on a stick video with no real definate information.
[6:44:01] RyoxTheRogue: maybe blizzcon 2021 annoucent for next expan?

[6:46:46] CorenDirebrew: Yes, It is the Argus sets with some orobos stuff on top of it
[6:46:48] Duekov: I think we can all agree 9.2 is looking not fun lol

[6:47:20] The_Fat_Jedi_: the asthetic is headache inducing
[6:47:21] Sollice: You maybe @KragnosWoW
[6:47:23] SlowMoJoe_TV: Shaman is the only cool one
[6:47:23] CorenDirebrew: @Towelliee It is the Argus levelling set + orobos levelling gear merged into one

[6:48:22] Herzenliegen: Another expansion they started good but crashed at the end
[6:48:23] Cooky_28: @Towelliee CONFRONT ANDUIN AND THE JAILER IN THE SEPULCHER OF THE FIRST ONES - Breach the vault containing the Progenitors’ most ancient and powerful creations. Face off against Anduin in a desperate attempt to free him from Domination, and put a definitive end to the Jailer’s plan in the expansion’s climactic 11-boss raid.
[6:48:23] Collected1: the only way this is good is if this indicates all of their resource is on 10.0 already because otherwise i'm worried
[6:48:23] SmygandeFizen: To be fair, i think after this tier we will get 1 more patch with void lords before next expantion
[6:48:24] Tilly: it's so samey and.... idk, to me at least not at all compelling

[6:49:07] CorenDirebrew: Compare THES sets with the ones from Tomb of Sargeras. And the difference is like night and day. One has unique designs, looks and colors for each class, and this one looks all samey

[7:06:57] Sollice: @Nebulizer87 Why. Who is to say the Jailer dies at the end of the expansion. I hope he doesnt
[7:07:00] tnhorrorfan: the prices for legggos will go up again
[7:07:01] Kisswani: seems like Bozja Kappa
[7:07:01] kokochris: ya
[7:07:04] elwingk: another heavy grinding systemn
[7:07:05] Riggoz1: its like torgast unlocks 2.0
[7:07:09] Armdel: probably just an overcomplicated reputation system
[7:07:13] Collected1: Sollice : if "we" lose then that might set up a reset of sorts in 10.0
[7:07:13] j_bar111: @Towelliee do you think the anduin preview platform looks like the lich king platform??
[7:07:14] Roaringkittylol: Another grind that we dont care about lets go!

[7:07:43] elwingk: someone please enlighten me what means copium? xD pretty please
[7:07:43] tdpark_: @Towelliee one of the raid boss is a female twin dreadlord boss
[7:07:44] Sollice: @Collected1 Exactly. And thats what I hope. I hope the jailer wins and our story as the way its been ends and 10.0 is the oh shit battle for World of Warcraft expansion
[7:07:47] PvtHudson093: how do you unlock double leggos?
[7:07:53] Kisswani: I'm kinda intrigued by the new zone the most tbh
[7:07:53] Collected1: Towelliee : surprised to see no cross faction or do you think that's coming later?
[7:07:54] mozavich: you decipher all the runes, you get a squid game invitation
[7:07:55] Boccardo316: I thought the game was dead Kappa
[7:07:56] rhodeos_: rep gribd
[7:07:59] Aravarth: 80 renown on one of your toons I think
[7:08:00] valianya: Idk about 'end of Book 1' of WoW so much as 'end of one book of WoW '  as in closing book on Shadowlands to start another storyline of WoW in 10.0

[7:08:29] Tastus: what was the site he was just on?
[7:08:36] oticai: @Collected1 have they ever done a "we lose" ending in any expansion ever
[7:08:37] Recknry: @elwingk taking the information like a drug and keeping hope - coping mechanism
[7:08:48] elwingk: thanks
[7:08:50] Odinslayer: can you zoom in?
[7:08:52] Mitune: and threw them out the window?
[7:08:57] bluehawkie: the best wow killer seems to be wow itself

[7:11:12] eaglerydr: yep Gatekeeping
[7:11:18] Ezekyler: one word per week, time gating content
[7:11:21] Obsolete2885: We have to grind to open up the grind.
[7:11:25] TheUnknowing: atleast its an interesting concept for gating lol
[7:11:27] The_Fat_Jedi_: but whats so important to find out? what if we unlock it and its bunch of flying spiders having small talk
[7:11:39] notguiilty: @Obsolete2885 XD yep

[7:12:45] notguiilty: well only 2 lol
[7:12:53] o__mj__o: @mozavich its not the grind .. its the meaningless grind.. every patch wipes what u did last patch..
[7:13:00] my_feethurt: the problem is these grinds feel meaningless and they only provide you with the game..a real grind is winterspring rep, or classic professions
[7:13:00] Ezekyler: @Towelliee remember thay said Nyalotha was a "big city" and we get a few tentacles on the background
[7:13:02] CorenDirebrew: Grinds CAN be okay, if 1.) They are completable within a reasonable time and 2.) They give you enough access regularly to make it enjoyable. Neither of these points were fulfilled in BFA or Shadowlands so far, unfortunately
[7:13:03] Odinslayer: wtf is this?
[7:13:10] Jysy: ?
[7:13:11] Slayd11: im so lost
[7:13:19] ChidaRL: where is this article at?
[7:13:24] mavericks312: what if the dreadlord they are talking about is denathrius and not malganis like we think

[7:13:52] Arbszy: What if the boss order changes each week.
[7:13:52] N3llee: Jailor is Mythic ONLY?
[7:13:53] MOLAR305: milking world first pop
[7:13:54] mozavich: @o__mj__o that's the nature of mmo to keep you playing and to bring in new players. if casual players had to go through the same grind you did (so it matters), it would detract new players from playing.
[7:13:58] vforveloso: time gated raid KEKW

[7:14:14] EclipserEU: tbh even they are confused lol
[7:14:19] magemaster225: they dont want the ending being spoiled before world first
[7:14:19] Sluggs_: what if theres no mythic
[7:14:19] Aquadriel: they removing mythic difficulty
[7:14:20] Odinslayer: normal/hc anduin will be last boss mythic will be zooval

[7:14:24] Glarblar: is there no mythic?
[7:14:25] Sollice: On raid release we dont get the full raid. When Mythic releases it will be FULL raid
[7:14:25] azzurrin: wrath style
[7:14:25] Redshaman999: Heroic timegate only
[7:14:27] EclipserEU: ICC again lol
[7:14:28] abilitytogoeven: 2 weeks of heroic and then mythic
[7:14:31] Skorb: so mythic not coming out when it normally does then.
[7:14:32] manmower: that's like 1% of the game, they're doing this for the other 99%
[7:14:32] Clawanorder: Its a Winged Raid like ICC
[7:14:32] zorish: @Towelliee  ICC
[7:14:32] magakigr: only normal / heroic timegate
[7:14:32] WreckedSmok: if somone like you is confused imagine newbies
[7:14:32] Velkhan: Nobody cares about world first race
[7:14:32] Sluggs_: removing mythic
[7:14:34] marshall_madness666: this happend too icc as well
[7:14:38] Imperius_Aeon: mythic is removed
[7:14:40] Odinslayer: first week
[7:14:43] MOLAR305: They are forcing world first to 2 weeks
[7:14:44] o__mj__o: @mozavich not true.. only in wow .. all other mmos grind build up ur progression .. what u did before stay relevant. In wow its wiped
[7:14:46] Kisswani: I think the first week with Normal heroic is not gonna feature the Jailer @Towelliee
[7:14:49] Odinslayer: first week thats hc/normal
[7:14:51] Slayd11: wait they removed mythic?
[7:14:51] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee 2 week HC then mythic 3rd week
[7:14:52] valianya: WF first half then WF second half?
[7:14:53] Velkhan: Thats the problem, that why the game sucks
[7:14:54] manmower: first week is heroic anyhow, next week will be mythic

[7:15:07] Cooboomy: it literally says when mythic is released the whole raid is unlocked, jesus people

[7:15:22] crashoverride_gaming: Did the announcement happen already?
[7:15:22] cineris_3: wowhead has an article on it
[7:15:24] magemaster225: its implied in the answer, when mythic comes out the whole raid is open
[7:15:32] sol_lok: if the world first raid was the first time we see the last boss that would be pretty hype
[7:15:33] magakigr: yes
[7:15:33] Slayd11: people are implying lol
[7:15:34] itjrey: yah
[7:15:36] Manabucho: 😃

[7:15:38] Redshaman999: yes

[7:15:41] Odinslayer: KEKW
[7:15:41] mozavich: @o__mj__o not really. even in ffxiv, what you did previously doesn't matter gear-wise. so that's not true.
[7:15:42] Maroleb: I MEAN LUL
[7:15:46] lithium364: what if 1 month for mythic LUL

[7:41:07] Kisswani: @Towelliee It would be great if they allow us to skip to the last 3 bosses after the first week . would be great for prog I think

[7:41:11] Slayd11: correct the last 3 bosses will be week 2

[7:41:22] Odinslayer: yea
[7:41:24] EvoThis: sounds like a handful of nerd probs
[7:41:26] Jombinoo: yea
[7:41:27] Slayd11: thats so fucking dumb
[7:41:29] Venkxx: you dont need to clear heroic to start mythic though?
[7:41:33] shinta__: you need to clear heroic to do mythic?
[7:41:35] Katosama: world first guilds need to extend the raid, so heroic gear boosts become harder ?
[7:41:38] Rudric_Ice: Weird
[7:41:39] SabakuBlood: So... dont ever play wow again? hell yeah
[7:41:40] largefromage: yeah makes sense I'm not confused at all Kappa
[7:41:42] mavericks312: you dont have to do heroic though
[7:41:43] zgag: Wondering how the double legendary and tier sets will work for each class.
[7:41:47] smashwow: that's so awful
[7:41:48] SilkeySmooth: thats the idea
[7:41:50] Centigrade: 14 boss world first
[7:41:50] mozavich: makes it more exciting imo
[7:41:54] KaisenSiru: This is  good.
[7:41:54] smashwow: like awful awful
[7:41:54] Rottencoarse: @Venkxx  you need to see the tactics for other bosses first before mythic
[7:41:57] SabakuBlood: broken boring game LuL
[7:41:59] mavericks312: makes it more exciting
[7:41:59] Odinslayer: @Venkxx no but they will add tier shit to the last 3 bosses ofc and they will gonna need to get them for mythic
[7:42:00] BubbaChubbs420: screw world first anyways
[7:42:01] Jombinoo: is better like that
[7:42:02] imdabestmane: good
[7:42:10] valianya: The idea is get last three heroic gear to raise ilvl for mythic
[7:42:11] Jalham: All this doesn't matter for the average player tbh
[7:42:14] Kisswani: @smashwow why tho ? to me it means they can tune the last three bosses better
[7:42:14] Vyntage1: cant satrt mythic until heroic last boss is dead?
[7:42:15] N3llee: @Bubbachubbs420 its literally the best thing about wow
[7:42:22] BubbaChubbs420: no
[7:42:22] bazziiiTV: but maybe you dont have to beat hc to unlock mythic in that tier. maybe you can just start mythic right away?
[7:42:23] KaisenSiru: He doesn't mind it
[7:42:26] Baldarsar: world first  lul its shit anyway
[7:42:30] Slayd11: so they are changing the game to account for literally only the world first people
[7:42:31] Alepouditsa: @Bubbachubbs420 yep i never care for it
[7:42:32] EvoThis: ^^
[7:42:38] Todmeister9000: that should make it more interesting then
[7:42:39] Stangin2122: power boost with another full clear of Heroic
[7:42:40] Venkxx: @Odinslayer pretty sure they wont, not before they hit a brick wall, they will start mythic first
[7:42:46] Stangin2122: just 3 bosses
[7:42:51] SabakuBlood: @Slayd11 no LUL
[7:42:51] BlewGamingGroup: people still do world first  runs ... nerd problems
[7:42:57] moa285: AngelThump
[7:42:59] EvoThis: @baldarsar blizzard is shit now. just a landslide now
[7:43:03] Sly_404: @Vyntage1 no, they just only get loot from them once before they start mythic progress
[7:43:04] TwoCenk: They will go re-clear for tier sets too
[7:43:05] Odinslayer: @Venkxx it all depends on the loot table...
[7:43:13] magakigr: the race will definitely last longer this time around
[7:43:14] Slayd11: @SabakuBlood why would they do this then
[7:43:14] camslam: as a casual player I dont think Ive ever full cleared nomral the first week anyway
[7:43:15] Wcvechten: imagine if only the last 3 dropped weapons lmao
[7:43:19] zgag: Max is still not 100% if it's also including mythic
[7:43:22] Vyntage1: @TheSlickRic Ok, thanks!
[7:43:23] feherlofia123: you dont have to clear heroic to unlock mythic tho do u
[7:43:24] mavericks312: i think the dreadlord is denathrius not mal ganis
[7:43:24] mozavich: lol a lot of haters in this chat
[7:43:24] Odinslayer: STORY!
[7:43:29] Kisswani: Give us a way to skip to the last 3 bosses and it would be great
[7:43:29] jrobdad: force a longer race?
[7:43:31] valianya: They change game for top 1% hardcore players all the time
[7:43:35] RobinDePoppin: They skipped 9.3 so they put all in one raid and one patch. @Towelliee
[7:43:36] sol_lok: probably need to defeat Anduin > next week we'll have gated story stuff that helps us progressive further and it involves anduins help
[7:43:41] BoiAtomico: viewership on twitch and relevancy for the game KEKW
[7:43:44] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  maybe they wanted to make the world first race longer??
[7:43:46] BlewGamingGroup: @Wcvechten thats probably why they are locking them
[7:43:48] cappei: Yeah, Anduin seemed really good at resisting that, huh? KEKW
[7:43:51] BigBusiness: CORRUPTION
[7:43:53] Trekxx: domination class next xpac PogChamp
[7:43:57] Garrujak: They did it for a really simple reason: there's a lot more chance of a big upset if every team doesn't get unequal amounts of practice.
[7:43:58] Tigris002: D:
[7:43:58] RobinDePoppin: 9.2 was supposed to be only anduin seems to me
[7:44:02] Soulofdragon01: @Cappaie had the same thought lol
[7:44:02] Sharkeys: its definitely a story built around delaying world first race lnoger
[7:44:06] smashwow: @Kisswani it artificially slows content down yet again. time gating is good for no one. they won't tune any better than they have historically because they won't have any more data than they normally do.
[7:44:10] Mesejas: to extend the word first kill they dont want to be cleared in a week or 2
[7:44:11] Slayd11: ya its fucking weird
[7:44:13] idenkaz_: thats a system not lore KEKW
[7:44:15] zgag: Max mentioned that he likes it, but not with mythic
[7:44:15] Maxoru0: I mean there could be a good reason why they are doing it that way. That's a good example
[7:44:17] Slayd11: it wasnt fun in ICC either
[7:44:23] Venkxx: @Odinslayer it doesnt, if the loot is shit, they dont want it, if its OP, they want to gear the players they have on the final boss, they wont know the final comp until they are there, so they will only get it once they know they need it
[7:44:25] eaglerydr: so we learn to resist from Anduin who couldnt resist ok
[7:44:33] RobinDePoppin: Anduin is going to help us defeat the Jailer @Towelliee
[7:44:33] SilkeySmooth: it wil lchange their stragities and mix things up
[7:44:41] r0b928: Defeating anduwin gives you the opportunity to upgrade your current gear to have resistance
[7:44:47] RobinDePoppin: Yea
[7:44:50] Imperius_Aeon: youve never had to do that?
[7:44:53] DishChi: Manduin :(
[7:44:53] RobinDePoppin: Anduin is going to help u kill the Jailer
[7:44:54] oTusch: @Towelliee crafting gear recipe from Anduin
[7:44:56] TwoCenk: Who will be last 3 bosses? jailer-arthas-uther?
[7:45:04] Slayd11: uther is fighting with you
[7:45:08] Kisswani: @smashwow it's one week .... I think you're overreacting tbh . , Mythic wont be gated , heroic and normal , you just do 8 bosses onstead of 11 for the first week
[7:45:09] moa285: Any dates?
[7:45:25] moa285: Thanks SeemsGood
[7:45:29] DeanoTV: probs march release
[7:45:29] BlewGamingGroup: @Imperius_Aeon no ... normally when a raid comes out , it comes out with all bosses available . its been like that for years
[7:45:31] Slayd11: this wont be until mid 2022 prob
[7:45:32] RobinDePoppin: August.
[7:45:33] king_julian_96: iam pissed
[7:45:38] Ortinoth: probally 6-10 months away
[7:45:40] king_julian_96: why timegate the raid
[7:45:41] kevo_k: late feb/march for sure
[7:45:43] khrownoes: 2-15-22
[7:45:46] moa285: f***
[7:45:46] king_julian_96: it pisses me off
[7:45:47] TwoCenk: @Slayd11 he might lose against jailer domination
[7:45:49] yhormgiantt: hey @Towelliee did you see the new boost to 60 ???
[7:45:51] UlsterFarl: April i think
[7:45:55] idenkaz_: locking it behind aotc? you already know the answer to that i mean cmon
[7:45:55] Layliah79: Raid is prob timegated for Story
[7:45:57] SilkeySmooth: summer alpha/beta as usual
[7:46:00] RobinDePoppin: July @Towelliee
[7:46:00] DaVeGaLiSoT: YIKES
[7:46:03] RobinDePoppin: 100% KEKW
[7:46:03] valianya: We should talk to Wrathion for advice on resisting corrupting domination, not Anduin
[7:46:04] Bogzeh: KEKW
[7:46:04] iseenoobpeoplee: april WutFace
[7:46:06] Odinslayer: Why does Blizzard reveal everything systems related in a bunch of different interviews rather than announcing it themselves? like wtf
[7:46:11] azzurrin: 10.0 in december
[7:46:11] Wunani: April is honestly a good take
[7:46:13] Slayd11: @TwoCenk maybe who knows at this point
[7:46:14] Wunani: that seems right
[7:46:14] Stangin2122: Jan 1,
[7:46:14] RobinDePoppin: nope
[7:46:15] king_julian_96: imagine timegating a raid
[7:46:16] RunningOutOfRAM: KEKW
[7:46:17] RobinDePoppin: No haha
[7:46:19] JaseLeland: nah
[7:46:19] Rudric_Ice: nope
[7:46:24] Maroleb: I doubt it

[7:46:30] magemaster225: game awards, maybe
[7:46:31] Wcvechten: They said Februari they'd announce stuff still despite no blizzcon right
[7:46:31] RobinDePoppin: Expansion announcement next November KEKW
[7:46:34] mavericks312: i think we we get an announcement with a title
[7:46:34] azzurrin: april or may 10.0 announcement
[7:46:35] mozavich: @Stangin2122 this.
[7:46:35] Ezekyler: don't think so, it will be a huge spoiler
[7:46:36] Solaris_Chi: Bro how do you go to all these places that blizz is just manifesting and killing all of these baddies to eventually go back to Durotaur and open up a farm with boars after all of this is said and done? Talk about Heroic PTSD
[7:46:38] Zerost0rm: oof
[7:46:38] Bogzeh: new expac 2023 KEKW
[7:46:40] Bixster: shadowlands was announced before 8.3 release
[7:46:41] d1stract10n: 10.0 2023
[7:46:47] smashwow: @Kisswani it's artificially extending the life for no reason. they said they learned their lessons. yet here we are looking at time gated content yet again.
[7:46:47] moonscryer: can this shitshow get anyworse...
[7:46:48] constipated_overlord: I love you but I am done with wow and this is not good for me I gtg LUL
[7:46:51] Maxoru0: @king_julian_96 if you looking at lore reason or sometime of learning an resistence. there could be a good reason they are doing a slight time gate on them.
[7:46:52] RunningOutOfRAM: 10.0 2050~
[7:46:54] khrownoes: patch or xpac?
[7:47:03] anamroth: 2023 :D

[7:47:38] Sharkeys: no way its releases in 2022
[7:47:39] king_julian_96: makes no sense
[7:47:42] RunningOutOfRAM: What do you mean you need a rfauth
[7:47:42] Odinslayer: no way 6 months only for a last patch? lol
[7:47:43] lowlifepuppet1: 9.2 drops then they reveal 10.0
[7:47:43] Rudric_Ice: pre-patch
[7:47:44] Kisswani: @smashwow honestly I think that's a ridiculous thing to say . it's one damn week . that's like saying not getting every single loot drop in the first week is " artificially extending the life for no reason "
[7:47:44] mavericks312: not if the draught is currently happening lol
[7:47:45] RobinDePoppin: 10.0 is 100% in 2023.
[7:47:45] 0AZD0: shadowlands is a drought
[7:47:46] cineris_3: November then
[7:47:46] TwoCenk: they will be push as much as they can

[7:47:51] Bogzeh: we draught at start of expac this time LUL
[7:47:51] Solaris_Chi: @king_julian_96 player retention
[7:47:51] Chuckforfun: Never EVER!
[7:47:52] nathrizen: they are not operating as normal now; there's more bureacracy and committees internally in the dev process probably
[7:47:53] notColt45: Drought is when everyone drops off
[7:47:54] Maroleb: no way
[7:47:55] Rudric_Ice: oh gawd
[7:47:55] Wcvechten: people forgetting ICC got timegated too
[7:47:57] kokochris: On the anniversary

[7:48:07] Slayd11: 2023 early
[7:48:07] N3llee: @Wcvechten no one is forgetting
[7:48:09] bob_the_demon: But if you read in one of the interviews there are saying that there will be an "epilogue" so 9.2.5??
[7:48:10] zgag: Blizzard might be looking to create a big splash for the new xpac.  It could come sooner than later with a better direction
[7:48:10] Stangin2122: I think the 10.0 Expac is going to come for the next Annivesary
[7:48:11] Odinslayer: december release like cata
