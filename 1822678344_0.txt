[1:50:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I expect changes for next season but yeah they'll probably let this ride
[1:50:41] pavepawns: it reminds me abit of the warlords box reward when u killed a certain amount of bosses u got a mission table quest that reward loot from that difficulty
[1:50:50] mavericks312: 10.1 may go down as a top 5 patch
[1:51:16] pex413: they want people to get gear and play before they release Diablo 4
