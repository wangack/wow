[1:21:25] majjkdee: played aloooot tho
[1:21:29] Enmael00: so what if renown is fast which is a garbage system to begin with
[1:21:32] brainy95: Choir of Thorghast u need for the legendary aswell
[1:21:33] tainas101: If you have a rift key or find someone with collapsing rift key(group rift portal) you can get about 6k rep in 15min
[1:21:34] Lokifurian: aaa if you do those dailies for your covenant, and some dungeons, you can get 80 in a week
[1:21:42] Polerize: two or three days with a concerted effort
[1:21:45] oliverheat95: few daily quests and world bosses
[1:21:47] tainas101: And once u get tier 4 u can farm rep omegafast
[1:21:52] trSwacky: u could get 80 within a few hours if u did torghast and the assault

[1:22:09] tainas101: Bgs also give renown
[1:22:42] lunatik710: i dont think he understands how to farm renown, you dont need torghast... you can get like 4-5 renown easy right now prolly 1 hour max
[1:22:46] awhdee: Swifty hasn't aged in 10+ years

[1:27:29] Surpr1seMF: 3 for world boss till 50, 1 after 50 till 80. Bosses like Oranomonis or Morgeth
[1:27:39] Slayer_Eagleone: Swfty also if you want to wear a second legendary you need to farm exalted with new faction.
[1:27:49] Slayer_Eagleone: thats the worse one lol
[1:27:50] majjkdee: what means with t4, t6? ^^
[1:28:00] DieselDemon300: i got 8 to 10 k research each time i went in

[1:35:39] jfunique1: Quarantine is if you were in contact with someone that might be positive -  when YOU are positive it’s isolation.  5 days from first symptoms OR 5 days after testing positive if you don’t have symptoms anymore you can get out 🤙🏼. I don’t know where you live but US and Canada it works like that.

[2:23:00] dslims: I had my wisdom teeth out, i didnt have any pain at all.
[2:23:10] bitlexx: @poope05 Looked it up real quick. Meds say there is no clear time range when some1 can infect others after being hit by covid. It only say after 10 days is the risk low, when the person itself had mild symptoms. Stay safe y'all!
[2:23:31] GreenSween: @dslims its not so much the pain as much as the dealing with it after :P
[2:23:36] Seanio7: @GreenSween I'd say focus on a good graphics card and processor for gaming, also an SSD harddrive.  16g ram is good

[2:28:19] dslims: @CodenameSwitch we was streaming the whole time, just on a different channel
[2:28:20] Geartrix: tier sets
[2:28:22] CodenameSwitch: solo queue can be fun
[2:28:51] Geartrix: some new arenas, wearing 2 legendaries and new tier sets are what im hyped for

[2:29:55] CodenameSwitch: "Shadowlands is our most alt friendly expansion yet" yeaaah right Blizz LUL
[2:30:04] Pantteranova: I got my alt to 80 reknown in less than a week.
[2:30:11] lunatik710: He acts like this 80 renown is a grind, when he grinder rank 14 is 1000% more a grind
[2:30:15] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:30:19] Geartrix: when i leveled a new alt renown 80 took 2 days through comp stomp spam
[2:30:38] Enmael00: LUL at this shadowlands shilling its a dead expansion get over it
[2:30:54] Dientemo: all grinds are not the same
[2:30:56] Pantteranova: Okay we get that, but getting 80 reknown is not a grind at all now Swifty.
[2:31:20] poturito: what about if you do a renown grinding like the r14 grinding. LUL
[2:31:37] Geartrix: dude you could be done in 3 hours

[2:32:18] Enmael00: "fun" ouch to shadowlands systems and gameplay that makes WOD a better expansion that SL
[2:32:20] Fwamin_Dwagon: not a truer thing was said
[2:32:25] CodenameSwitch: might not be that long anymore to hit 80 renown, but doesn't mean it doesn't FEEL shorter lol
[2:32:41] poturito: yeah thats the problem, retail isnt fun right now, i just wanted you to tell us that true
[2:32:41] Flopilop: honestly ive been enjoying shadowlands as a part of a guild, raiding, doing mythics torghast with a group can be quite good
