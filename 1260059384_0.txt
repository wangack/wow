[2:08:24] AmericanFat: Dude cant believe towelliee still streams WoW, he has been streaming even before LIRIK existed

[2:09:00] jamarky23: i mean dident he also get like... born n shit?

[2:09:06] LToblivious13: class campaign
[2:09:10] MrGattz: half yall dont even know towelliee is liriks dad
[2:09:23] stallowned: LUL
[2:09:25] jerexify: @Towelliee Right. Finish the class hall campaign, then do the Breaching the Tomb achievement, which will require stuff on The Broken Shore.
[2:09:27] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  warlock has 3
[2:09:28] Ch0p_Su3y: warlock has 3.. purple, red and green

[2:25:58] jerexify: Yeah, I definitely didn't do that. lol That's cool.
[2:26:07] Colt_Engineer: that's because blizzard didn't do anything for the old content for the longest time
[2:26:07] jerexify: That's a good change, IMO.

[2:36:22] Yosbo: he isnt strong enough tbh , he is like nessingway a cool chac but nothing mayor
[2:36:26] Kman3107: @TheAtomicRam so Rexxar is a furry? :o
[2:36:32] BoiAtomico: He'd sooner go to Un'goro live with the gorillas than deal with the horde's bullshit KEKW
[2:36:43] SirVoro: He's never not doing something too technically he has the same title as us he's in lore as "Champion of the Horde"
[2:36:45] AlphasaurusRexx: he has a full time job. doesnt have time for a main story arc
[2:36:48] xXSiebzehnXx: He has a story about why he doesn’t conform to the horde norm right?
[2:37:12] R2RHIN0: Just like a good book cover
[2:37:14] BoiAtomico: @Kman3107 Not on a furry level, mostly on a "Fuck these dudes bullshit" level

[2:48:19] Dinosew: That’s what she said
[2:48:40] captivate7: I loved the launch of legion
[2:48:42] dracullus: every release after Legion was really clean, I guess it's because sharding
[2:48:47] NickLeonhearth: legion is the last expansion i really enjoyed, before that mop
[2:48:48] Broomba: @MrGattz i ordered my pc via origin - i have the spec and want to see u think its good
[2:49:46] CrowCommando: WoD Launch. I was there LUL
[2:49:57] cabalish: where is the lamb sauce ???
[2:49:57] NA_Mus: Maybe if they scrapped SL like they scrapped wod. then maybe next expac will be good like legion Kappa
[2:50:13] SmokedHog: new mount farming alt, or new meta dps toon?
[2:50:36] xXSiebzehnXx: Tito is not new, but mount farm
[2:50:37] lalelusa: SL was bad because there was no Hemet Nesingwary
[2:51:01] xXSiebzehnXx: @lalelusa shoulda been a sign LUL
[2:51:02] Dayszen: what is kaddy doing
[2:51:02] CrowCommando: Dadgar
[2:51:09] Dayszen: in retail
[2:51:50] CrowCommando: @dayszen Lore wise, I'm pretty sure he's in Kara just studying or something
[2:52:20] NA_Mus: I was hoping for a maldraxxi raid at some point this expac
[2:52:25] lalelusa: that 9.2 teaser had me in tears over their magic mystical water XD

[2:52:35] xXSiebzehnXx: Kadghar realized jaina got captured by the dreadlords 2 or 3 expansions ago, but he knew calling her out would only cause more bloodshed between horde and alliance and he knows what’s coming and we need the whole OG team including the Dragons, where we will be starting in 10.0
[2:52:35] MaxGrandpre: Most people forgot but for the first month everyone was really pleased with SL, patched came way too slow, small problems became really big and Blizzard as a company is shit right now.
[2:52:46] CrowCommando: @lalelusa Water is pretty great
[2:52:59] xXSiebzehnXx: towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil
[2:53:40] Layercake: Unless this is the new norm going forward...8/9 months between patches and only 3 raid tiers HahaThink
[2:53:53] Broomba: imagine doing these quests now with no flying unlock
[2:54:29] SmokedHog: 1 or 2 days of walkouts probably didn't do much in the grand scheme of things
[2:54:57] JackHealMe: What is it your farming?
[2:55:00] NA_Mus: its repeatable
[2:55:02] NA_Mus: lol
[2:55:05] crotastar: you have to give until you get 100 supplies
[2:55:11] xXSiebzehnXx: Legion class mounts
[2:55:20] NA_Mus: its pretty much a daily
[2:55:32] crotastar: The fastest to gather is the meat
[2:55:55] crotastar: 5 per 5
[2:55:58] xXSiebzehnXx: Big meaty claws
[2:56:00] Ez_a_szomoru: 70
[2:56:03] NA_Mus: 70
[2:56:12] dengueuk: 70
[2:56:13] lalelusa: "play them game the way it was intended to"
[2:56:16] Prisana: Tow with the hunter whaaaat

[2:56:34] crazy1god: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:56:39] jerexify: 50
[2:56:40] crotastar: 50
[2:56:43] NA_Mus: 50 now
[2:56:50] Broomba: welp this character is going to go broke
[2:57:06] Panasonic82: 50
[2:57:37] mrrazputin: Towelliee if you could do visual uppgrade of 1 classic raid per expension to current standards which one would you pick ?
[2:57:37] jerexify: @Towelliee Have you done the assassinations on the Rogue questline yet? That part was fun, and still a tiny bit challenging, even this far removed from Legion.
[2:57:44] xXSiebzehnXx: You ever seen the back of a 20 dollar bill, ON AETHERAL WEED
[2:57:54] NA_Mus: they took it out and readded it
[2:57:58] Naturalbeef: T
[2:58:02] jaina8675309: you even can do wod to
[2:58:04] magemaster225: it got fixed this patch
[2:58:04] Nowack_hs: You need be offline on the PC before you can login on the phone to do it.
[2:58:14] crazy1god: @Towelliee Thank you for advice yesterday. She tested, and like the regular Wow over the classic ! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHi
[2:58:21] luckfore: wow companion
[2:58:30] NA_Mus: ^
[2:58:32] Naturalbeef: You can do all missions from all Xpacs now
[2:58:51] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah, but I thought you couldn’t access companion app while online
[2:59:24] reiversa: How many chars have you level to max prox.? 30-40? 100?
[2:59:24] KaisenSiru: monkaHmm
[2:59:26] xXSiebzehnXx: It says you are already logged into that account or some shit
[2:59:31] Broomba: wow companion is no longer available -- they morphed the wow and wow companion into 1
[2:59:39] LourageTV: dream scenario for me is after WOTLK classic it spits, and we get "old school wow" with new expansions and content but with a focus on keeping that spirit of classic wow... maybe no LFR for example and LFG is per realm
[3:00:08] Broomba: @contentstarvedgamer u can still do wod gold missions via garrisons
[3:00:08] Masqerader: You can't use it while in game
[3:00:16] xXSiebzehnXx: Told you LUL
[3:00:25] Naturalbeef: You'll have to log off but it can save you travel time and logging into multiple characters
[3:00:25] SunwavesOnMars: no flying mounts ! bring back world pvp and spawn farm kids
[3:00:27] AlphasaurusRexx: nothing more boring than re-releasing the same game over and over...just a different version of it..
[3:00:27] xXSiebzehnXx: I’ve tried it multiple times
[3:00:34] Broomba: yes
[3:00:55] xXSiebzehnXx: I use it when I’m taking a dump or something
[3:01:02] its_andyd: will tito ever hit 60??
[3:01:24] Broomba: god i remember these quests

[3:02:45] Shrenko: tell us why catJAM
[3:02:50] magemaster225: you think it has LFG at the start instead of at ICC
[3:02:51] dracullus: Jesus it's been 12 years and people still think LFR is killing WoW
[3:03:01] SunwavesOnMars: it is
[3:03:02] LourageTV: damm I hear you read my comment then get hit with 5 ads LUL
[3:03:04] Masqerader: People actually think that making this game worse would be an improvement lol
[3:03:08] smashwow: wotlk + premier MAX Kappa
[3:03:09] reiversa: Well, problem is, wow get's boring nowadays after a while. Nothing they can give us to stay in the game. Professions, destroyed. PVP destroyd. Content, nothing.
[3:03:22] AlphasaurusRexx: its been almost 20 years and ppeople still think classic is good
[3:03:25] drewetling: morning how meany mounts we got today
[3:03:30] gold9871: the 2 hr thing
[3:03:31] reggiepowa: yeah
[3:03:35] AmericanFat: Wrath is the last classic expansion, because in cataclysm, the mount collection appears. Which would ruin the concept of mount collecting in retail, since there would be two different collections, which is stupid.
[3:03:36] Screamnsteam: tormentors spawn every2 hours in the maw and theyre random
[3:03:39] reggiepowa: they are on a set schedule
[3:03:44] magemaster225: yeah theres a google doc schedule
[3:03:48] magemaster225: on wowhead
[3:04:26] Screamnsteam: I looked up alot of schedules and none of them were 100% accurate lol
[3:04:31] gold9871: you do them passively
[3:04:34] Odinslayer: these based on the assaults
[3:04:39] reggiepowa: they are all easy but you need the right quest up during assault
[3:04:41] gold9871: rng is youre ....
[3:04:48] NA_Mus: fox
[3:04:54] NA_Mus: the sly fox achievement is one
[3:05:00] Odinslayer: that needs 3 kyrian assaults lol
[3:05:00] reggiepowa: need 3 kyrian assaults for that
[3:05:02] gold9871: thats 3 kyrian assaults
[3:05:23] magemaster225: you have to look them up on wowhead, theyre achievements for the off covenant quests in the assaults
[3:05:28] gold9871: talk to the girl
[3:05:32] Odinslayer: you still can do it, the npc is there
[3:05:32] pronkk_: you cna still see him
[3:05:37] NA_Mus: you can still  do it
[3:05:50] NA_Mus: then the flame dance is the other one for kryian
[3:06:30] pronkk_: have to be int he rfit yeah
[3:06:45] facerolljack: thats venthyr assault
[3:06:45] M_iras: Venthyr assault
[3:06:50] pronkk_: yeah but has to be in venthyr assaulkt

[4:03:53] xXSiebzehnXx: That shit is low hanging fruit
[4:04:00] Kinghorn: I will do it for you, they are super fucking lazy
[4:04:03] xXSiebzehnXx: it's all react bullshit
[4:04:07] thatguylavii: Did they already do maintenance ?
[4:04:11] Thoreya: ptr pog
[4:04:12] PadidinJones: Just because you are the president of the US does not mean you get a free pass
[4:04:12] Mecabeast: 8.3 was rough if you skipped 8.2 so sounds close to the mark
[4:04:18] Colt_Engineer: one problem is all these top streamers think they're Gods when the average person does not care for them at all lol
[4:04:29] Mozillarum: NINJA is the perfect example of that "stars align" moment.
[4:04:31] MaxGrandpre: They are kids in the 20's still, let's say they definitely doesn't have the wisdom of somebody older.
[4:04:34] Kisswani: winners of the Noble Prize for Streaming POGGERS
[4:04:53] Kinghorn: coxNod MaxGrandpre
[4:05:05] Colt_Engineer: streaming is a skill, because nobody watches a boring person
[4:05:12] Brodih_: yep Ninja played the right game at the right time @Mozillarum
[4:05:16] itsapaul: EZ
[4:05:19] xXSiebzehnXx: I think the react content is the worst, most misinforming, horseshit I've ever seen
[4:05:45] MightyWombat: @Colt_Engineer its down to personality...if you have none doesnt matter if you have skill people will not watch :p
[4:05:49] Mazeltough: currently in line for the new Air Jordan 1, never done this before hope i get them\
[4:05:55] Colt_Engineer: @Colt_Engineer true
[4:05:58] adxx: if i want to watch a tv show ill go watch the tv show. lol.
[4:06:00] Mozillarum: @Qhaz_ he embraced that "drake featuring" so bad, It was cringy AF.
[4:06:09] Kisswani: I dont mind react content if it supplement original , personal content
[4:06:28] Mecabeast: i like when masters of a trade react to content around their profession
[4:06:45] MaxGrandpre: True that
[4:06:49] Templexx: and its not going anywhere. just chatting is here to stay with the current meta
[4:07:02] MrGattz: you can always improve for sure. but at some point you have everything so why do you care enough to improve? you would rather just fuck around and break the systems cause its something to do.
[4:07:07] MaxGrandpre: I kinda miss the twitch "meta" where we just meet around common interests.
[4:07:34] Kisswani: what does twitch think internally of what's happening btw ? are they freaking out or just waiting for the storm to pass ?
[4:07:44] xXSiebzehnXx: @MrGattz Self improvement is infinite. I think they just find a pooint where theyre comfortable and dont care aymore
[4:07:50] boxxxxxxxxxxx: Swollie
[4:07:56] MrGattz: @xXSiebzehnXx yeah exactly
[4:07:57] xXSiebzehnXx: essentially mirroring what Tow just said LUL
[4:08:25] magemaster225: venthyr op
[4:08:27] Colt_Engineer: just get up on your golden weings and fly man
[4:08:32] Heero_Effect: True…I mean asmons said the other day  him reacting to a video then him reacting to himself reacting to a video
[4:08:33] Rexy95: wait for your engibelt to fail and glide LUL
[4:08:44] Kinghorn: has wings but cant fly towCry
[4:08:54] Colt_Engineer: @Kinghorn the life of a penguin
[4:09:04] Schloshed: Can you Venthyr mirror up to places?
[4:09:04] boxxxxxxxxxxx: @Kinghorn Da life of a cow
[4:09:10] vercetti101: what about that toy that launches you in the air or is it WoD only
[4:09:17] Templexx: yea 100%
[4:09:17] Mozillarum: have a nice day everyone :) cya
[4:09:24] Colt_Engineer: @vercetti101 I think they restricted it
[4:09:26] Kisswani: mad about what they are reacting to , not the react meta itself
[4:09:27] Colt_Engineer: DE BEARS!!
[4:09:34] Kinghorn: PridePenguin PrideFlower
[4:09:49] vercetti101: gotcha
[4:09:54] bumpstock75: does the Venthys door of shadows still work ?
[4:10:03] Kisswani: wait ? who the fuck reacted to Lord of the Rings ? danHuh
[4:10:04] NVbrutal: bans need to be longer than 48 hours, start banning them for 6 months and they will respect the rules a bit more lol.
[4:10:07] adxx: people dont have to pay when a streamer watches a show...that's typically paid for. Thats the problem.
[4:10:44] Coppermedusa357: how tf did pokimane only get banned for 2 days?? hello?? ppl like her are so pathetic sometimes.
[4:11:25] adxx: @Towelliee yeah its a stupid argument, because people still have to PAY to play the game, lol. its not the same with shows and movies.
[4:11:43] rampgee_: Coppermedusa357 what ?
[4:11:49] vignola99: Technically they're right as in most EULA's dont give permission to stream games, but in practice there has been no video game company ever taking action in like a decade, I think nintendo tried it once and received HUGE backlash from it
[4:11:54] i4mcont3mpt: when you purchase the rights by purchasing the game it is like getting permission already
[4:12:02] luckfore: just let them stream it, if they get banned, fuck em
[4:12:31] longhauler4ever: when is reset?
[4:12:36] CardinalTX: I see that type of attitude more and more in the work place. People dont want to take ownership.    Well look what johnny did over there!
[4:12:41] Kinghorn: speaking of bored
[4:12:45] iblighters: Some of the raid trinkets are looking pretty good
[4:12:54] Gingerprimer: @i4mcont3mpt in practice yes in legal terms now
[4:13:02] LokktarrOgarr: I am impressed that you never get burnout playing WoW. I always stop playing a couple months each year.
[4:13:06] Colt_Engineer: no way
[4:13:13] not_pr0: wonder if they could have lawsuits wrt effectively providing streamed content under pjracy claims
[4:13:16] Colt_Engineer: Blizzard would never let us have that
[4:13:47] i4mcont3mpt: @gingerprimer the whole purpose of the licensing agreement when you log into a game is that you will not pirate, but they give you permission to likenesses. when you start playing the game it is considered art and not the original work
[4:14:12] vignola99: @Gingerprimer Yep in legal terms any video game company can strike you for playing their games minus a few exceptions that state in their EULA that its permitted, but we all know they'll never do it, its way too profitable for gaming, but knowing your rights never hurt
[4:14:19] LokktarrOgarr: Good to hear, I am back playing too.

[4:15:14] adxx: i miss Warcraft. I love shadowlands but man the lore has really nosedive into wtf-ness for me lol.

[4:17:57] vignola99: @i4mcont3mpt He's not, Nintendo literally striked multiple streamers before for playing their games, if its not stated in the EULA (which is very rare ),  then you dont have the right to stream a game, its fine if it hurts your feelings but its the law LUL

[4:20:30] vignola99: @i4mcont3mpt I'm sorry dude this just hurts my brain now, you're free to believe wathever you want to believe LUL
[4:20:34] Bayne77: if i click, theres not going to be some virus downloaded off the interwebs or nothing is there?
[4:20:38] gamerrick0: how much bigger is this place than korthia
[4:20:38] Kisswani: @Shrenko what in gods name is that emote ? WutFace
[4:20:49] i4mcont3mpt: hate to be the only one in the room who understands legalese
[4:20:51] Broomba: @MrGattz i picked the 11th gen over the 12th is that a good choice?
[4:20:52] Gingerprimer: @i4mcont3mpt yes you have rights to do stuff with the prodcut you do not get digital streaming rights for it
[4:21:06] Shrenko: a cute lalafell AYAYA @Kisswani
[4:21:13] Skullgrinx: they been sucky for quite some time now
[4:21:18] i4mcont3mpt: @gingerprimer you do not need Express intent to stream a game that you own, the only limitation resides within companies who provide a stipulation that you have a secondary license
[4:21:22] Kisswani: @Shrenko viera for life danSgame
[4:21:33] sl1nky1981: @gamerricko Much bigger
[4:21:41] i4mcont3mpt: that would be a violation of ownership in law
[4:21:41] RagingPunk: is that F_ site good?
[4:21:43] MrGattz: @Broomba its certainly not a bad choice for sure

[4:23:24] sifer007: do they ship to EU?
[4:23:26] Gingerprimer: @i4mcont3mpt uou have zero legal rights to broadcast games. The only reason game companies are not enforicing it is due to free advertsing for the game. In practicaltiy yes you do not need permission to stream a game but if a publisher dmca your channel for streaming a game you have no legal rights
[4:23:27] vignola99: @i4mcont3mpt You should read up on section 107 and 102 of the copyright act, it'll take you less than 10 min, i'm not trying to "argue", its just facts, and i'm not emotionally attached enough to continue the conversation, its fine if you believe what you believe :P
[4:23:32] RagingPunk: looks cool for sure
[4:23:35] r0b928: My factor meals are being delivered on the 18th. Idk why it takes so long to get them

[4:26:02] sifer007: lol vis there another system?
[4:26:51] i4mcont3mpt: @gingerprimer for as many times as I've had this engaged argument I can't tell you how stupid everybody seems to sound when they think that when you own an object you cannot use it in public with other people viewing it
[4:26:56] Eithos87: taco pok
[4:26:58] ninedraft317: You can open more then one at a time
[4:27:05] Kisswani: and I think you can research stuff from different trees simultaneously @Towelliee
[4:27:14] BlueBlurPrime: gromit
[4:27:39] Kisswani: I think from diferent trees you can , same tree , not
[4:27:43] propoopimus: you guys trying to prove each other wrong in twitch chat ResidentSleeper

[4:28:16] Allexi88: You have to unlock everything to get flying
[4:28:20] relios898: @Towelliee its an achievement
[4:28:25] lauvlywow: You need to unlock all of them for an achievement that unlocks flying
[4:28:28] Allexi88: It will be weeks before you get it
[4:28:29] ilavayoutv: in development
[4:28:31] ilavayoutv: lol
[4:28:34] Shrenko: @Allexi88 nope
[4:28:52] Allexi88: @Shrenko Achievement has been changed unless they changed it again
[4:28:54] jambii03: need all research completed to get flying
[4:29:07] Piyth: Its achievement
[4:29:24] BlueBlurPrime: all of it ..... ALL
[4:29:25] jambii03: no lol all
[4:29:28] lauvlywow: "All"
[4:29:34] gold9871: 22 - 26 days
[4:29:34] draconisraccoonis: 6 dasys 18 hours
[4:29:35] Thoreya: mr gm said 1 tier
[4:29:37] Kisswani: no not all of it
[4:29:38] magemaster225: read the achievemnt again
[4:29:38] relios898: need to complete the full console
[4:29:41] Kisswani: NO
[4:29:42] Stall1: 6 days 18 hrs right?
[4:29:43] Thoreya: nmo
[4:29:45] Kisswani: that was misinformation
[4:29:46] Thoreya: nono
[4:29:51] KingSlayerYotam: @Towelliee https://ptr.wowhead.com/news/zereth-mortis-flying-requirements-unlock-flying-by-researching-cypher-of-the-325235
[4:29:52] Thoreya: that was fake news
[4:29:53] gold9871: all rows
[4:30:07] Kisswani: @Towelliee no only the first ones
[4:30:10] Skullgrinx: So in 72 days we'll get next expansion announcment.
[4:30:16] draconisraccoonis: top one says 6 days and 18 hours not just 18 hours
[4:30:45] Kisswani: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1478772019902701573
[4:30:57] Shongoshi: is tier set only crafted or also drops somewhere?
[4:30:59] Naturalbeef: I can't believe we have to play the game to unlock flying /s
[4:31:13] Allexi88: @Kisswani And it was just changed again. That tweet is old
[4:31:15] magemaster225: the tier set catchup and the double leggos arent on ptr yet
[4:31:33] Kisswani: @Allexi88 if that's the case then my bad
[4:31:40] motorboatingpro: it looks like unlock one a week to me
[4:31:44] PyroGambler: ptr?
[4:31:49] Zaanthrax: imo flying will be a 2.5-3week'ish

[4:32:05] Kisswani: and I apologize
[4:32:07] Broomba: dat time gate KEKW
[4:32:31] Kisswani: @Allexi88 from what I understood it's a visual bug . I am still gonna hold the hope KEKW
[4:32:42] draconisraccoonis: @Broomba still better than pathfinder
[4:32:43] Allexi88: @Kisswani We can only hope lol
[4:32:44] galifax2: welp, its official, covid pretty much infected my whole household, stepdad's test came back positive, mom is in rather bad shape unfortunately
[4:32:45] bumpstock75: farming is fine... but is it 4 week or 12 weeks of farming
[4:32:50] brewss: patch today Pog
[4:32:52] Broomba: i have no problem with time gate -- it makes me come back and work for progress @towelliee
[4:32:55] Ozolz: actually play the game LUL
[4:32:55] tenassity69: id be happy with that lmao
[4:32:55] Arvidian: server's up
[4:32:55] AtomJar: flying breaks the zone, can get them wanting you not to fly right away
[4:32:56] lauvlywow: raid log for 1 year haha
[4:32:59] sticksaredrifting: pog 2
[4:33:02] KingSlayerYotam: do people bitch about flying in FFXIV?
[4:33:05] Eithos87: woot I can move on to another game then

[4:33:32] Kisswani: only I speak for Luckfore Kappa
[4:33:37] Twizted23faith: rofl
[4:33:37] MetalManGG: this guy KEKW
[4:33:41] Allexi88: Lots of people like the daily content
[4:33:53] luckfore: @Kisswani sure dude 4Head
[4:33:58] Broomba: time gate in legion and bfa made me play more and more and made me enjoy the game and story
[4:34:01] Alienfromger: different optinions? D:
[4:34:02] kraiyx: timegating flying is perfectly fine; god forbid you have to play the game to get stuff
[4:34:03] DrWraithjr: I love having flying as a reward. It make me actually want to achieve something. It is important even after the expansion is done.
[4:34:05] KaisenSiru: Definitely doesn't speak for me. I enjoy everything
[4:34:06] uxibixu: i agree timegating is needed in some ways, but sometimes it feels like they are going overboard with it
[4:34:08] Thoreya: @contentstarvedgamer who are u tho lol
[4:34:09] Vivelli: put the gold saucer into WoW :P
[4:34:14] Atherions: the only way to avoid timegating is to have artificial scarcity, which is also toxic
[4:34:18] Allexi88: I think its a bit excessive how long it might take to fly, but hopefully it will be a bit faster than we think.
[4:34:21] Templexx: maybe call it community council for feedback...lmao
[4:34:22] Ozolz: but do they even listen tho
[4:34:24] Kisswani: just make it better 4Head
[4:34:27] thiskidmage: i think its more to level the playing field between people who have infinite hours to play and people who have 2 or 3 per day
[4:34:28] Heero_Effect: I popped a pimple and it exploded epically
[4:34:30] smashwow: so waiting 18hrs for a perk that you farmed up is good content? that's not how gear works. you get it you use it. @Towelliee
[4:34:47] Eithos87: have weekly stuff that can be done in 1-3 days so we can play other games
[4:34:51] kokochris: just do better towTinfoil
[4:34:58] Endin: no player power in the zone gonna hit casuals hard :/
[4:35:01] sticksaredrifting: gyros pog
[4:35:08] Kisswani: Gyros is great POGGERS
[4:35:10] PyroGambler: from each zone?
[4:35:13] macanudo17: @towelliee it’s called being “constructive” … concept is lost on most
[4:35:15] elbinn: i think its like little treasures
[4:35:17] smashwow: there's player power in the zone. that's what pocpoc is
[4:35:22] Broomba: gyros are good

[4:35:42] brazkat: servers up
[4:35:53] BoiAtomico: can we agree that having some research taking almost 7 days is excessive tho?
[4:35:57] MetalManGG: @contentstarvedgamer gtfo
[4:36:01] duman_2020: I havent played retail in such a long time. So, what is this? :P
[4:36:03] DrWraithjr: Warframe does that and it is fine
[4:36:03] Ceolas: @Towelliee Do you think 10.0 will be a better expansion than the last 2?
[4:36:04] im_n0t_jezus: payoGtfo payoGtfo
[4:36:07] Sielu11628: @contentstarvedgamer Troll
[4:36:17] im_n0t_jezus: @contentstarvedgamer payoGtfo
[4:36:17] draconisraccoonis: god people just cry so much, why dont all of you geniuses make your own game then
[4:36:27] Ozolz: if it takes 7 days to farm wouldn't that be enough, why do you need to wait one more day
[4:36:27] Suplazin: While you're waiting those 18 hours you're probably going to be playing the game...where if you finished all the content instantly you're going to cancel sub
[4:36:28] Kisswani: @TheAtomicRam that I agree with , 24 hours should be the max imo
[4:36:29] elbinn: I guess my question would be what is the point of even having us wait the 18 hours? Is there a point to it?
[4:36:54] Carahail: @contentstarvedgamer you mean he's making a living being a streamer...oh say it ain't so
[4:37:07] smashwow: @elbinn extra login metrics
[4:37:07] Zaanthrax: games fun if u want to have fun really, i do however wish they had dungeon specific sets via badges/valor just so everyone doing m+ could get it - 5man buff sets basically
[4:37:10] Broomba: @Towelliee i have no problem with time gating and i enjoy it cause it adds a layer of working and unlocking content that benefits my character, lore and overall progress of game :)
[4:37:12] draconisraccoonis: @contentstarvedgamer wow youre so cool and informative
[4:37:24] BoiAtomico: I'm willing to wait the 24 hours, but since there's a sub to pay the game, I'd say 12 was the max I would implement @Kisswani
[4:37:27] Templexx: GOT EMM
[4:37:31] Naturalbeef: This guy sure is angry at Towelliee
[4:37:38] Sielu11628: Towellie spilling facts. Haha GOT EMM
[4:37:42] Zorikune: The servers are up
[4:37:46] sticksaredrifting: anyone get anything good out of their chest?

[4:37:56] DrWraithjr: LUL
[4:38:01] Arvidian: lol
[4:38:02] Ceolas: @Towelliee Do you think 10.0 will be better than the last 2 expacs?
[4:38:03] Vivelli: thats a hell of delayed reaction
[4:38:04] TSquadSully: KEKW
[4:38:05] Layercake: HahaThink
[4:38:13] Arvidian: towPog
[4:38:14] tenassity69: $80 lesson. damn, id have given it to him for $40
[4:38:14] MetalManGG: hate watching is a hell of a drug
[4:38:14] luckfore: "i hate towelliee the blizz shill, HERE TAKE MY MONEY"
[4:38:22] Masqerader: @Towelliee Reg servers are back up if your still waiting for them
[4:38:24] Broomba: new emote -- popoc
[4:38:48] Templexx: typical golf with friends shill
[4:38:48] DrWraithjr: 😡 Stop having fun playing MMOs
[4:38:49] kokochris: fucking Golf...
[4:38:53] drewetling: you keep being you cum bag schill  love yeah!
[4:38:55] Masqerader: I would call that sound business
[4:38:59] Carahail: @Towelliee  so what your saying is Streamer= shill?
[4:39:03] smashwow: i don't mind grinding but grinding to wait. that's double dipping. i already invested time into the mechanic grinding the resources.
[4:39:04] KingSlayerYotam: Look at towlliee, never mind don't look
[4:39:12] Mysticflyy: you can put that in your action bar. It is to summon Poc if you lose him.
[4:39:29] smashwow: the hurry up and wait isn't engaging content.
[4:39:30] Havenmess: Havenmess subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:39:30] grey_rafa: Any predicts for 9.2 date?
[4:39:35] smashwow: the grinding of the resources is
[4:39:52] Templexx: congrats then
[4:39:57] ace0gg: there are ways of slowing players down without using systems that are just "wait x days" like not allowing flying, increase respawn times? lower drop rates, increase currency costs etc, rep grinds (with rewards that aren't completely useless...)?
[4:39:58] Vivelli: "times change" - garrosh
[4:39:59] Eithos87: he is just jellous you are making money playing games
[4:40:00] Bayne77: "he doesnt care about any of you".  why should he?  i mean, other in passing at twitchcon 2016, the man has never met me.  why should he "care" about me.  he entertains me, i toss him some cash each month. its been a pretty good relationship.
[4:40:10] grey_rafa: Thanks @hindenbergg
[4:40:11] JonnyFivesAlive: have you decided on a class for lost ark?
[4:40:18] Mysticflyy: right click him. talk to activate the scanning.
[4:40:42] Havenmess: I would lvoe to make money playing games =(
[4:40:51] Vivelli: i cant get used to the back hop from gunlancer, paladin is super fun tho
[4:41:00] Gingerprimer: Also I the Zerath Mortis system is not even important due to basically now power being locked behind it from what I know
[4:41:04] Zaanthrax: i thought pally was more support/heals than tanky in that game
[4:41:19] Mysticflyy: You will get sounds and pings on your mini map.
[4:41:19] BoiAtomico: @bayne77 kinda paying for sex and expecting the prostitute to fall in love or something lol
[4:41:25] Gingerprimer: *not having
[4:41:30] shimwood: He does more damage than me darkoHands
[4:41:42] Broomba: poc poc is poggers
[4:41:54] Ldysansa: Ignore hates. I decided to follow your lead and go mount farming. I actually got Onyxian Drake yesterday. I am so happy about that.
[4:42:09] smashwow: @Gingerprimer tier sets will probably be locked behind it. we've yet to hear about tier set crafting unlocks and how we unlock the double leggo other than it happens in this zone. which is a little scary.
[4:42:12] ace0gg: do you think blizzcon will ever return
[4:42:26] Bayne77: @bayne77 pretty much.  i dont expect him to be my best friend just because i watch him play games
[4:42:26] Mysticflyy: When the buff runs out. just refresh the scanning.
[4:42:33] hestar: So Popoc = BB8 from Star Wars?

[4:44:53] Gingerprimer: @smashwow TBF tier sets will be available from the raid. I guess we will just have wait and see
[4:44:54] BoiAtomico: the fucking water meme got me installing the PTR and the PTR got me subbed again. They know the memes are the best bait for subs

[4:46:34] Thoreya: towelliee was just havin such a blast in ptr
[4:46:47] smashwow: @Gingerprimer true. it's a new feature. but it was just nice to hear. for once they recognized M+ and PVP as "legit" endgame with that avenue of getting gear.
[4:46:52] Rudric_Ice: how many overall chars u have ?
[4:46:56] YungshrimpXD: wtf is som
[4:47:02] valkari317: I am not asking this to troll, at all, in anyway. Are a lot of people still playing wow? I know they haven't released sub numbers in years. @Towelliee

[4:48:36] dr_dimentia: you really think wow is still more played right now than ffxiv overall or just cause of the xpac
[4:48:42] Ceolas: @Towelliee Do you think the next xpac will be better than the last 2?
[4:49:38] Broomba: cant wait to play wow and new world on new pc with much improvements in cpu and gpu :)
[4:50:07] inctor: u farming for all mounts, or just nalak specifilcally you want?
[4:50:08] smashwow: it probably is. but the margin isn't as large as it use to be
[4:50:09] KingSlayerYotam: @Ceolas it will be pepeMeltdown
[4:50:29] Bayne77: @Broomba did you opt for the SSD?  im telling you, far and away a better experience with the computer
[4:50:37] YungshrimpXD: Luck Feveling
[4:50:54] FutileDiploma: @towelliee you enjoying WoW again. I came back and i am enjoying it a lot
[4:51:13] FutileDiploma: I think a break is all I needed
[4:51:19] Garthd: 18k I think?
[4:51:26] Templexx: yea gotta  look at server size too
[4:51:29] Naturalbeef: FF doesn't help their numbers by literally not letting new people play
[4:51:51] Bayne77: 3?
[4:51:57] DrWraithjr: FF stopping new accounts is the weirdest thing I have ever seen an MMO do
[4:52:00] Garthd: "the game supports up to 18,000 simultaneous logins in that region — up to 750 players per world server."
[4:52:06] Mysticflyy: they need to revamp and add clusters
[4:52:06] Broomba: @Broomba @bayne77 the nvme 1 tb for os and 2 tb for games
[4:52:09] Heero_Effect: Belluar sure pushes final fantasy and then shits on every other game mmo or not haha
[4:52:11] dr_dimentia: there are uhh, 6data centers with 5-6 worlds on each
[4:52:12] Vestrai: there are I think 8 data centers each holding up to 120 servers
[4:52:15] longhauler4ever: @towelliee how long have you been farming this mount?
[4:52:18] smashwow: FF can't get more servers. weird times.
[4:52:20] DrWraithjr: 24 servers?
[4:52:21] Vestrai: 12 servers*
[4:52:37] wizjay1990: how many lvl 50
[4:52:38] Bayne77: @Broomba duckTU
[4:52:43] Kinghorn: chat throwing out 50 different numbers
[4:52:48] Kinghorn: eweaseDerp
[4:52:55] Blah206: An expansion during a drought, a lawsuit, and twitch momentum. FF still never caught up to WoW numbers.
[4:52:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: execute order 66 more servers
[4:52:59] DrWraithjr: Nice
[4:53:00] CrowCommando: Nice
[4:53:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: Nice
[4:53:02] Clay2K_: much better nuber Kappa

[4:53:07] sethg_: Nice
[4:53:09] theaccountant219: nice
[4:53:11] Warland3r: Calculated
[4:53:15] devoted_bee: mwk69 mwk69 mwk69
[4:53:21] hestar: Well now thats not a terrible number.
[4:53:21] dr_dimentia: definitely more than 750 people
[4:53:29] BoiAtomico: @Blah206 in all fairness, they didn't catch up due to a physical lack of components for new servers
[4:53:33] Mecabeast: nice
[4:53:41] dr_dimentia: safe to assume 17-18k probably
[4:53:53] Blah206: @TheAtomicRam New World has more players
[4:54:21] at1c: @Blah206 "easier" to scale when your back end is AWS
[4:54:25] BoiAtomico: @Blah206 It does not, New World servers have a way lower cap for players lol
[4:54:31] Garthd: You can check steamcharts :)
[4:54:47] Kinghorn: not everyone plays ffxiv through steam
[4:54:52] Kinghorn: in fact most dont
[4:54:54] Blah206: FF has included free trials in all of its numbers.
[4:55:04] hestar: what about WoW currently?
[4:55:12] Poriand: @Garthd most dont play on steam
[4:55:19] pronkk_: what color is the oondasta mount? cobalt?
[4:55:22] Garthd: gotcha
[4:55:28] BoiAtomico: It's ok to dislike the game @Blah206 just don't go making shit up as it goes lol
[4:55:43] luckfore: wow prob has double that
[4:55:44] Gingerprimer: You can not even que as a Trial

[4:55:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: paying customers have prio yeah
[4:55:45] BoiAtomico: free trials are disabled atm
[4:56:02] Mecabeast: subscribers should get prio
[4:56:07] BoiAtomico: can't buy the expac/game and trials are temp. disabled
[4:56:40] BoiAtomico: servers are full with people waiting to login, might as well stop it from getting worse
[4:56:46] Garthd: A lot of people are playing MMO's rn, good times :)
[4:56:48] Thoreya: the top US horde realms have to have like 15k people each
[4:57:06] Blah206: @TheAtomicRam How am I making shit up? I said FF population never caught up or surpassed WoW subs.
[4:57:29] dr_dimentia: Yoshi P definitely made a great game, gotta give him credit there and how well the game runs
[4:57:30] xsp00n: illidan and A-52 have around 25k ewa
[4:57:33] xsp00n: ea*
[4:58:00] boxxxxxxxxxxx: I did lol
[4:58:04] Poriand: i unsubbed. waiting till 9.2
[4:58:07] Jarless: i did
[4:58:07] boxxxxxxxxxxx: Unsubbed after mage tower >:)
[4:58:11] Thoreya: they SHUD ADD ON TO IT IN 10.0
[4:58:20] Thoreya: enough with the forgotten content
[4:58:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they still sold the game the que would still be bad for everyone and they would end up giving more gametime. either lose money by giving time away or by not making sells. 1 option some actually play
[4:58:39] Immxrtal: torghast
[4:58:42] Kinghorn: with hookers and blow
[4:58:42] Jarless: that will cost a raid tier
[4:58:44] shimwood: I hope they change the bear skin too
[4:58:46] BoiAtomico: You just said yourself they're counting free trials when the trial accounts are unable to even join the game atm lol. The servers are filled to the brim and overflowing, and they don't have more subs because of a physical impossibility, not lack of interest. You can dislike the game, as do I, but making stuff up is not cool @Blah206
[4:58:49] ace0gg: make it like the brawlers guild, new bosses that refresh over diff patches
[4:58:53] Blah206: This is as close to FF will ever get to "mainstream" imo. The set of circumstances were extraordinary.
[4:58:57] chavodk: we did get new tower, thorgast !! LUL
[4:58:59] death_cam_: i hope they bring back CMs from mop and wod aswell those were fun back then.
[4:58:59] sticksaredrifting: D:
[4:59:04] Ceolas: @Towelliee do you think the next xpac will be better than the last 2?
[4:59:14] Alastree: Hey Towelliee
[4:59:36] Autoexeq: HE KNOWS
[4:59:41] Gillrad: remember how much people complained about the difficulty of torghast? And it wasn't even a fraction of how hard the mage tower stuff was
[4:59:52] Yadani97: YEEEES
[4:59:52] Blah206: @TheAtomicRam When I said they include free trials. I was speaking of the older numbers claiming FF was the most played MMO in the world. Multiple articles claimed that truth including free trials. Look it up.
[4:59:53] Biddlebit: when you thinking 9.2 o
[4:59:56] powerlifting_nerd: HE KNOWS Pog also Kappa
[4:59:58] Biddlebit: is out
[5:00:01] luckfore: 7.2 start was bad too
[5:00:09] Aedarax: ToS was also a lot of fun tbh
[5:00:13] iblighters: yeah up until NH it was not good
[5:00:16] Skullgrinx: bs! your opinion.
[5:00:23] rabbitse_88: I loved legion :*(
[5:00:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: emerald nightmare was so terrible though I ended up skipping till the end of the expansion
[5:00:49] Bayne77: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:00:56] Blah206: And a lot of the interest surrounding the game really wasn't organic.
[5:01:06] smashwow: 7.1.5 had a lot of good. then 7.2.5 fixed a majority of everything. but then the curible of light fuckery was awful.
[5:01:09] LawrenceDreamer: Do you think there are more people playing ff14 than wow now?
[5:01:10] BoiAtomico: @Blah206 On that I agree with you
[5:01:16] devoted_bee: hear, hear
[5:01:18] Mecabeast: id rather go back to bfa then anymore shadowlands
[5:01:20] Wcvechten: Time to get some of that Hopium

[5:04:02] BoiAtomico: They've been at war so far and so long, it's a wonder people haven't starved to lack of food KEKW
[5:04:38] Autoexeq: I remember there was a lot of bad talk about Shadowlands early. It felt both rushed and not. How many times did the Torghast change only during Alpha and Beta
[5:04:39] BoogieDuck: hearing not listening
[5:04:49] Bayne77: Origin is worth it though
[5:05:10] Ceolas: @Towelliee Hopefully the next xpac takes player feedback into account. Community Council feels dead in the water given the lack of responses to any retail posts

[5:33:54] Jonrain: Kyrian covenant storyline showed you that Scourge was free
[5:34:03] Vicarious1: but they are controlled by zooval right ?
[5:34:04] Niksen_99: Is the mount inside the boxes you open from the boss ? @Towelliee
[5:34:05] Jonrain: and just murdering people
[5:34:15] Vicarious1: Zooval only dies in end of 9.2
[5:34:19] Masqerader: scourge are a meaningless threat
[5:34:20] theDirtyon3: @Vicarious1 no
[5:34:31] Vicarious1: no ?

[5:36:00] Templexx: haha
[5:36:05] boxxxxxxxxxxx: Shadow Lands would quite literally be a shadow memory
[5:36:05] supertaffer: @Voldreka u cant let the scourge run free forever no matter what the threat is
[5:36:07] Maydie6066: what if there is no 10.0, and the hamsters running the servers passed away a long time ago, and we replaced them with fake ones who are not running Energizer, so they are dying
[5:36:11] nomad_91: but.... but N'zoth is ded towD
[5:36:12] Hellokittyisland007: LOL
[5:36:14] dan_monk: Maybe Blizzard just wanted us to be occupied for a certain amount of time while they try and work out a 9.2 time pepehands

[5:36:34] Snabido: Plot twist: fish n'zoth had made a deal with zovaal Kappa
[5:36:40] pacificmc1: Bruh Towelliee knows what 10.0 is, so we can rule this theory out for sure now KEKW
[5:36:45] Archiee: then the John Cena music kicks in
[5:36:45] Squeak_Official: Imagine it just unsubscribes you and says “there is no more content to compete”
[5:36:50] Masqerader: fish comes out to Undertaker music
[5:36:52] at1c: It was just a dream
[5:36:56] iblighters: no
[5:37:03] Aquadriel: More like Nzoth was controlling Zoval cause Nzot is fucking 500Head
[5:37:17] ninedraft317: It was all a dream
[5:37:22] grapyz: He might win and destroy everything and we'll have to go back in time in 10.0 to stop him fro good Kappa
[5:37:25] obbi87: @Towelliee if tyhey do Nzoth good again. then i would be so happy. Black empire exp :O I would cry of happiness.  They did nzoth so bad.

[5:38:10] Aquadriel: let shadowlands be a dream, a bad nightmare lmao
[5:38:14] Templexx: dream within a dream
[5:38:27] LourageTV: the story nose dived from BFA onwards lets be honest though
[5:38:31] pavepawns: we are gonna kill turalyon
[5:38:32] Kriach: wish
[5:38:37] MFKnightS: do you know if there is a website that goes zonee by zone on what you can complete there?
[5:38:39] lalelusa: we return to  Azeroth. IT's been taken over by the Scarlett Crusade wagig a holy war. The world soul will by stabbed by the light as the final power to injure her
[5:38:43] Snabido: Cinematic: zovaal defeated, victory dance. Cut to black, you wake up in a bed magni screaming "champions the woons are not healed, we lost"
[5:38:44] Felforit: Purple rain Kreygasm
[5:38:49] GoobleGamingTV: What if we come back before Cataclysm and realize Cataclysm never happened!
[5:38:52] Plague_GG: Hentai expansion Pog
[5:38:54] pacificmc1: I want an expansion where the Scarlet Crusade is one of the center villains, perhaps the first raid
[5:38:56] Blackminuz: where is khadgar? :p
[5:38:59] at1c: Take help from the Titans again if that happens?
[5:39:01] Maydie6066: what if Sargeras was trying to save us from the pantheon? what if all of them are bad and been trying to matrix control us???

[5:39:43] Samurai3434: Shhhhhh. I'm reacting to Avatar.
[5:39:43] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee any idea of what the Heroic and Mythic mount from Zoval will be?
[5:39:45] Vicarious1: for all this 10900 years

[5:40:03] queeflabs: i think itll end.. the camera will pan up and shoot up the sky and there'll be a truman show style door with all the original devs just looking down laughing caling us all cucks
[5:40:05] Maydie6066: not Zoval
[5:40:06] Aquadriel: @Towelliee nzoth sent us to zoval cause we are still carrying his "gift". When zovaal weakens Azeroth, our gift manifests and Nzoth takes advantage, killing zovie and corrupting Azeroth.
[5:40:14] jerexify: @Towelliee Wait, when did we learn that? Did I miss part of the story?
[5:40:16] Felforit: "Hallowed are the Ori" - Pelagos
[5:40:23] Kriach: this pelagos as arbiter is so stupid
[5:40:30] Gingerprimer: @jerexify PTR content
[5:40:34] Kriach: why not bolvar? he is doing literally nothing this exp
[5:40:37] Heero_Effect: Pelagos best soulbind
[5:40:49] Gingerprimer: Pelagos as the arbiter makes sense
[5:40:51] Masqerader: Illidan/Sargeras are broing out right now
[5:40:54] BoiAtomico: wait wat now? Pelagos new arbiter?
[5:40:55] Squeak_Official: Who is new war chief
[5:40:57] jerexify: @Gingerprimer Oh, ok. I had been avoiding that, but I have to expect at least a few spoilers watching a WoW channel. lol
[5:41:02] Samurai3434: Bolvar can't be the arbiter. He's busy doing react streams
[5:41:07] pavepawns: bolvar already doesnt wanna be lich king. why would he wanna be the arbiter next @Kriach
[5:41:15] Blackminuz: Zovaal is Loki! xD
[5:41:26] cipusanx: its blizzard tho
[5:41:29] Autoexeq: But we are champions BabyRage
[5:41:34] lalelusa: I still think he corrupted Wrathion to some degree
[5:41:34] Maydie6066: anything is possible with the power of friendship!
[5:41:36] Armdel: thats just blizzard writing for you atamShrug
[5:41:38] Gingerprimer: @jerexify understanable at this point blizzard shoudl not have story stuff on the PTR IMO

[5:42:29] Vicarious1: @Wheeellz HOLYY
[5:42:33] iRegretn0thing: Also, he kept saying that hes the only one that can save us from the jailer
[5:42:34] MaxicalB: he is a fish he knows
[5:42:39] Rippan: Zovaal is a fish NotLikeThis
[5:42:41] iseenoobpeoplee: dont forget sire denathrius
[5:42:49] Armdel: nzoth is a mecha and zovaal drives it
[5:42:49] Skullgrinx: I actually thought The Void was behind all of it
[5:42:50] Felforit: How far ahead have Blizz registered their trademarks before?
[5:42:50] Blackminuz: maybe he will reset it all, so we start from the begining again when we were a nobody? :p
[5:42:51] iRegretn0thing: during his fight
[5:42:54] minael1: zovaal is my favorite villain so far (excluding Arthas)
[5:43:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: sargeras is going to be like you should have let me just end this already
[5:43:01] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee since the color in Zoval room looks like Azerite blue Magni will be in the fight
[5:43:13] Samurai3434: What class you playing in Wrath Classic?

[5:43:48] Rippan: jerexify oh god no
[5:43:58] Gingerprimer: Heal da woons
[5:44:00] jerexify: @r0b928 No no, see, MAGNI is N'Zoth. lol
[5:44:07] Kriach: jaina is nzoth

[6:28:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: 1001 after farming up all the bonus rolls
[6:28:31] xrandomdoodx: even scarier if they don't test the last 3 bosses at all like they stated they might lol
[6:28:37] r0b928: I’m guessing 1000 attempts
[6:28:59] smashwow: yeah, venth pally lego sucks balls
[6:29:18] sticksaredrifting: rwf will test the last 3 bosses Kappa
[6:29:29] pacificmc1: I have no confidence in blizzard testing it enough internally, just look at mage tower
[6:29:32] smashwow: KJ showed us the second scenario is more likely @Towelliee
[6:29:34] AlphasaurusRexx: do we know how much trash is in the raid this next tier?
[6:29:40] luckfore: they never test last boss on mythic or do they?
[6:29:42] Kisswani: yes
[6:29:44] xrandomdoodx: ya it would be great if it all works out for sure
[6:29:45] Alegnowar: yes
[6:29:51] Kisswani: yep
[6:29:59] smashwow: we hope

[6:31:12] Sin_GamingTV: @Crypticedge If you're a charger fan, you're used to it by now
[6:31:23] Eraste: @Sin_GamingTV truuuu lol
[6:31:26] Kisswani: @Sin_GamingTV towOof
[6:31:51] Crypticedge: @Eraste Season ticket holder for years, so i feel you, its tough out there man, but it least we have our guy at QB @Sin_GamingTV Sadge i know lol
[6:31:59] Alegnowar: how many char for love rocket?
[6:32:44] Eraste: will they be able to see the journal beforehand?
[6:32:48] Sin_GamingTV: @Eraste Until the Spanos family stops giving away talent for dogshit trades the Chargers won't win a SB
[6:32:55] Kisswani: @Eraste Journal already in PTR
[6:32:58] Rudric_Ice: u can't save love rocket anymore

[6:33:56] Eraste: sorry, not following 9.2 - wasnt sure if they were hiding the last 3 journal. cool, tho
[6:34:02] Kisswani: the new name is fine , still prefer the love rocket tho
[6:34:03] Nerdmeat_: I mean honestly Heartbreaker is a pretty good name for it for you
[6:34:07] PvtHudson093: penis rocket
[6:34:48] Hayon5: yo guys , is Zerith Mortis is optional , or you have to do it for sockets + 2 legendaries ?

[6:34:56] Ninjatun4: that would be awesome
[6:35:01] mayonaes: So basically a pokedex
[6:35:05] Aedarax: hide it behind rep POGGERS
[6:35:05] Kisswani: great idea tbh
[6:35:27] Ninjatun4: world first race would be alot interesting aswell
[6:35:29] Kisswani: they'll probably just time gate , each boss's journal will need 2 weeks Kappa
[6:35:45] Eraste: @Aedarax KEKW 5k anima to unlock a mechanic
[6:35:58] Aedarax: @Eraste KEKW
[6:36:08] lalelusa: first day of LFR in 9.1 and I got the mount first try. best day ever!
[6:36:20] ProClicker: Imagine if they hiding the final cut scene because it's the end of Azeroth and all the player characters. The new WoW game after Shadowlands is a fresh start
[6:36:21] jaydavidsen: People are still going to just screenshot and give everyone access to the journals tho right, I think maybe tie it to RWF like unlock it after first kills
[6:37:12] reggiepowa: even for savage you had guides

[6:37:23] boxxxxxxxxxxx: The point of the internet is to share info :D
[6:37:31] Romnus: Sharing information is literally the reason the internet was made lol
[6:37:31] Ilibrit: If I redeem emote-only chat how long is it for?
[6:37:39] Vahs_Redclaw: guides for stuff as it comes out is fine, FF is nice cause it's easy to go fully blind
[6:37:45] BoiAtomico: @Romnus PORN
[6:37:52] Vahs_Redclaw: giving people the ability to do that is a nice option
[6:37:59] reggiepowa: you can go blind in wow as well if you want to play like that
[6:38:01] Kisswani: AngelThump
[6:38:07] jaydavidsen: Yeah I think journals don't really matter for much outside of RWF was just more what I was getting at, like I don't think they're important either way if you wanna go blind you just can
[6:38:17] Ilibrit: man I miss MoP such a good expac
[6:38:39] AlphasaurusRexx: they should also change AOTC achieve to killing all bosses on heroic
[6:38:48] Rudric_Ice: predict one of 10.0's new systems
[6:39:11] Airitreya: did the add on drop percentage go up? wasn’t it at 24 last time
[6:39:25] BoiAtomico: @Rudi_Ice Professions revamp
[6:39:39] Eraste: KEKW
[6:40:00] mayonaes: I think we will be pleasantly surprised by 10.0's features. But perhaps I am just very optimistic
[6:40:06] Ilibrit: @Rudi_Ice Talent trees going back to more options
[6:40:10] Rudric_Ice: dude i miss archaeology
[6:40:24] Airitreya: oh that’s cool, i didn’t realize it tracked that for you
[6:40:39] Airitreya: the variance factor i mean
[6:40:48] pavepawns: im 100% calling a new class for next expac
[6:40:50] r0b928: That is mathematically not correct
[6:40:53] lalelusa: the dance party was a really cool gimmick
[6:40:53] Kisswani: I think because Blizz is not that concerned with absolute balance between specs , they have more freedom in fight design
[6:41:50] Chrisd1991: what addons?
[6:41:56] Kisswani: even visually it was impressive
[6:41:59] D4rkBelphegor: No more New World streams ?
[6:42:01] pavepawns: my favorite fight will probably still be imperator margok from highmaul
[6:42:04] Eraste: sylvanas fight Kappa
[6:42:07] Hayon5: KEKW
[6:42:08] pavepawns: dunno why but that fight was so enjoyable
[6:42:08] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:42:10] SicDogg: lol
[6:42:37] Jonrain: lmao
[6:42:43] SpoofAvatar: I miss Gladiator stance, can't wait for WoD classic, LUL
[6:42:44] Shugnight: blackhand was epic
[6:43:04] Eraste: my favorite fight ever was XT-002 hard mode but thats cause I was a feral at the time and just dumpstered the boss
[6:43:31] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee An easy mount to farm is buying the egg from the murlocs for the green proto drake
[6:43:47] Jherny: heroic vizier zor'lok pre nerf
[6:43:48] Rudric_Ice: member when we got zin'rokh  one of the coolest swords in the game from archaeology they need to bring back the damn profession
[6:43:49] mayonaes: Uu'Nat was fun Kappa
[6:43:51] at1c: Stack, dont stack, DPS, dont DPS, spread, dont spread,
[6:44:05] lithium364: you think they will ever use the Island KI on raid bosses or adds?
[6:44:53] Kisswani: yep
[6:45:10] rensdeamo: Been playing for 12+ years - PTR is same same - Run from A-Z, Kill 20 something - Boring !!! The need to be more inventive
[6:45:22] Kinghorn: they also all have pretty tight enrage timers
[6:45:23] Eraste: ff14 is super choreography (which ive been enjoying a lot as a new player)
[6:45:28] rensdeamo: WOW
[6:45:38] rensdeamo: Monnsters
[6:45:43] mayonaes: quest?
[6:45:46] Kisswani: not in raids he means
[6:45:50] theDirtyon3: What would you like to do for a quest exactry?
[6:45:51] mayonaes: All mmo's have kill quest
[6:45:59] draconisraccoonis: people acting like ffxiv bosses are more interesting or innovative than wow are high on that copium
[6:46:00] BoiAtomico: Go X kill amount of Y is pretty much every RPG in history KEKW
[6:46:00] LourageTV: he means how every quest is go kill X 20 times and repeat
[6:46:04] Eraste: 20 minutes of cut scenes and story NODDERS

[6:46:07] LourageTV: runescape questing gets it right
[6:46:08] rensdeamo: More puzzles , more fun
[6:46:11] woodchuck91: @ainvest thats every mmo created dude xD
[6:46:19] theDirtyon3: puzzle quests KEKW
[6:46:19] Archiee: Puzzles aren't fun bro
[6:46:19] Hesh3: assign a style point to each gear and debuff those with trash transmogs.
[6:46:21] Hugest: Sit on this spot for 30 seconds while dancing, turn left and jump 4x
[6:46:23] Inthezonewow: There is more puzzles in 9.2 LUL
[6:46:23] reaprwolf: Legend of Dragoon, that is all
[6:46:24] pavepawns: fun is subjective
[6:46:26] Rudric_Ice: Kill quests are like bread n butter of mmos
[6:46:30] Niksen_99: Is there any major difference playing horde or alliance? @Towelliee
[6:46:36] Exodeo_: Remembering old nagrand quests..
[6:46:37] Alegnowar: puzzles are so boring tho, rather kill 8 pigs
[6:46:38] TSquadSully: i don't want puzzles in my quests bro lmao
[6:46:41] pavepawns: i like mass murdering
[6:46:41] pacificmc1: Kill quests are fine... The real issue is getting class design to be fun
[6:46:42] brewgamingtv: oh god no i hate puzzles lol
[6:46:43] BoiAtomico: when Kojima innovates, they called it Amazon delivery simmulator LUL
[6:46:43] Hesh3: the eyeball maze! NO
[6:46:45] Sin_GamingTV: Having to repeat the same puzzle over and over is just annoying
[6:46:51] lithium364: maybe not puzzles but more mini game quests that are good and not tedious
[6:46:52] rensdeamo: Right variety
[6:46:53] Kisswani: bitch we are dumb as shit , leave puzzles out of the game
[6:46:55] amricatt: Yuck no puzzles.
[6:46:56] draconisraccoonis: Kill this boss by playing bejeweled? really, come the fuck on
[6:47:00] gwar234: lol go run mists if you want puzzles
[6:47:01] Planet_of_the_Apez: I ageee with puzzles... like skyrim
[6:47:04] Eraste: escort quests, obviously. everything is an escort quest
[6:47:04] frenzoll: Puzzlecraft
[6:47:05] FrozenItaliano: I liked the datacrons in SWTOR...was puzzling/platforming along side the standard questing
[6:47:05] Aedarax: daily puzzle POGGERS
[6:47:07] pronkk_: i LOVED blingtrons circuit toy, that was a puzzle
[6:47:07] w2cher: Hi, i wanted to ask you if wow is worth playing right now, i have been playing it on and off since tbc  last time played half  a year ago and I dont know if it is worth time now. Great content
[6:47:08] thesunisagiantlazer: I feel like GW2 got questing the most right so far that I've seen, with they way you can share events with other players etc and the quests give you multiple options for what to grind not just grab one thing
[6:47:09] draconisraccoonis: go play sudoku
[6:47:09] Angryfist40: kill quest are mmos to be honest lol
[6:47:16] LadyJasmin: i hate puzzle
[6:47:17] instant_savage: wr goinf nack to nazatar

[6:47:18] SpeedyKe_Stefan: ESO has many quests which make you think a bit (take moral decisions, etc...)
[6:47:20] pacificmc1: Puzzles would just be annoying
[6:47:21] Archiee: World of War-Puzzles
[6:47:24] rensdeamo: Better than boring kill 20
[6:47:25] Archiee: LUL
[6:47:27] theDirtyon3: you would end up just repeating thjose puzzles after a while....
[6:47:28] lithium364: to be fair holocrons from swtor would be cool if they can somehow block datamining where they are on ptr
[6:47:32] Parsa_KHF: more optional hunt quest(big rares with lot of health) that have mechanics
[6:47:33] AlphasaurusRexx: I wouldnt mind puzzle world quests coming back. those were fun in BFA
[6:47:36] Kisswani: in world quests
[6:47:38] bukka_hot: bejewled \
[6:47:40] SpoofAvatar: Shadowlands tried to change up World quests with different stages.
[6:47:43] ShadyWizard: me too
[6:47:45] Kisswani: @AlphasaurusRexx they are coming back
[6:47:48] brewgamingtv: kill move on kill move on lol
[6:47:50] AinaTan3: I'd take some inspiration from Assassins creed quests
[6:47:51] w2cher: Hi, i wanted to ask you if wow is worth playing right now, i have been playing it on and off since tbc last time played half a year ago and I dont know if it is worth time now. Great content
[6:47:52] Nerendis: We have this convo on this stream every month for the past 10 years

[6:47:56] jerseyfive: hell no legion puzzle quests were cancer
[6:47:56] Rudric_Ice: legion had some nice puzzle quests
[6:47:58] TheUnknowing: If you want puzzles, go play sudoku bro
[6:48:00] draconisraccoonis: i think this guy was dropped on his head
[6:48:01] SmuttBudgie: More escort quests Kappa
[6:48:01] AlphasaurusRexx: @kisswani hell yea
[6:48:02] clambynature: For me, every quest is a puzzle
[6:48:05] at1c: secret world a game designed out of puzzel quest
[6:48:06] Okri24: From what im hearing is that guy just wants to play Runescape
[6:48:09] StreamElements: Use code POG-TOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorBot #ad
[6:48:16] DrWraithjr: Buggy quests are nice to break things up. The biggest thing is that quests need to contribute to the story of the zone. Wow does a decent job of that.
[6:48:16] Hesh3: facts
[6:48:18] Okri24: Has all the things they want
[6:48:20] Kisswani: @AlphasaurusRexx I think there are 3 types of puzzles in ZM WQs
[6:48:23] draconisraccoonis: @ainvest when you develop a game let me know, so ic an stay the fuck away form it
[6:48:25] MexicanMisker: @Towelliee i LOVE the "kill 1 mob" quests, i cant stand the white knights that defend long/unfun/complicated quests FailFish
[6:48:26] Kisswani: LUL
[6:48:27] Pharaoh_326: EQ required a group.  was a different time too
[6:48:30] Kisswani: towOof
[6:48:30] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @w2cher (warning)
[6:48:39] Sin_GamingTV: You end up killing faster as you progress through a patch, odds are you won't be able to finish the puzzle any faster than the 1st time
[6:48:40] thesunisagiantlazer: GW2 makes it just feel like there's an objective to contribute to and you can do it however you like but is still basically kill x monsters grab x things
[6:48:41] shimwood: I wanna Make Lo Go in 9.2!
[6:48:41] Pubstar_LTD: Everyone always talks about runescape in these conversations then you go to the runescape community and they all hate questing LUL
[6:48:43] lithium364: i think the lorewalker cho stuff was cool in mists
[6:48:47] MexicanMisker: i just wanna kill 1 mob and then move on with my day
[6:48:55] Rudric_Ice: Would you rather do legion puzzle quests or Nazjatar puzzle quests
[6:48:59] Okri24: @Pubstar_LTD Not true but ok
[6:48:59] BoiAtomico: FFXIV is worse in that regard, they go to the point of "Go to that map, kill 5, come back. Great, now go back again, and kill the same shit, but 15 now! and come back again!"
[6:49:02] Kisswani: @w2cher it's not bad , pretty good now . 9.2 is where the new content is gonna be
[6:49:05] rensdeamo: Other fames were "inventive" - rifts eg - WOW copied
[6:49:08] Pubstar_LTD: @Pubstar_LTD 100% true
[6:49:11] rensdeamo: *games
[6:49:14] ProClicker: No leveling would be cool. Have the quest be for gaining knowledge for spells and attacks. Eventually unlocking more powerful versions of yourself like mage to wizard.
[6:49:16] Planet_of_the_Apez: maybe its time for wow to end...
[6:49:22] Kisswani: there is no kill 5
[6:49:24] draconisraccoonis: imagine thinking you can come up with a new and innovative thing that the company who has been doing this for over 17 years has not thought of
[6:49:28] Xindii: puzzle quests LULW
[6:49:34] Snabido: Those WQs with multiple steps are not it
[6:49:36] Broomba: wrong
[6:49:37] duhworks: all there really needs to be is a good mix of everything
[6:49:37] woodchuck91: @Towelliee The mobs are tired to be killed! Its time for revive quests Kappa
[6:49:39] Kisswani: it's usually just go there , go there next , ok now go there
[6:49:42] BoiAtomico: They literally take the piss on you
[6:49:46] AlphasaurusRexx: i would like to use a pool net to clean the magic water. where is that quest.
[6:49:54] Buckwink: I just want blizzard to go back to simpler times in terms of the story. Bring back things like the Defias brotherhood or the scarlet monastery

[6:50:03] Alepouditsa: ff is just a vitrual novel
[6:50:05] DrWraithjr: Exactly, you quest for the sake of questing in FF. In wow you feel like you are moving the narrative forward.
[6:50:07] thelazywarrior: ff side quests are just if you need exp lol
[6:50:09] Broomba: main quest in ff14 is story and progress
[6:50:23] Buckwink: things like that instead of space villians
[6:50:28] Nerendis: Defias and Scarlet? PLay classic 4Head
[6:50:43] lithium364: where is the quest to steal milk tho
[6:50:45] draconisraccoonis: the game is over 17 years old, people dont want to go and kill more scarlet montesary guys

[6:51:44] Hesh3: what have they been doing this entire time? maybe they've grown.
[6:51:44] LourageTV: there is nothing exciting about mega boss destroying the world
[6:51:45] DrBubz: What was your favorite quest line to go through?
[6:51:46] Kisswani: Vancleef's grandson next
[6:51:48] gyllygan: If I wanted aliens I would play StarCraft or SWTOR.
[6:51:50] Nerendis: @mattoxi no changes killed classic
[6:51:50] pavepawns: id personally want whatever happens next to be on azeroth. after that it can be whatever. giant space demon goats with tentacles and talking space dogs invade us
[6:51:54] Roaringkittylol: The problem is Blizz doesn't have competent story writers to flesh out a story to the level that FF does.
[6:51:58] Niksen_99: True its just because its nostalgic but who cares at this point
[6:52:00] draconisraccoonis: i wanna kill some galactus space asshole that wants to eat everything in its path
[6:52:03] DrWraithjr: Legion was an AMAZING story
[6:52:12] Xindii: Dance
[6:52:17] LourageTV: is this starcraft or warcraft
[6:52:17] draconisraccoonis: @LourageTV you sound like an idiot
[6:52:20] ProClicker: We need an enemy that will destroy Azeroth which will force everyone to escape on the repaired Exodar
[6:52:21] cahoots82: Pirate dudes that steal your shit and you have to go get it back - WILDSTAR?!?!
[6:52:21] Roaringkittylol: We have a copy cat of Thanos...

[6:52:25] Shugnight: LUL
[6:52:29] Kisswani: Space aliens stealing our shit , that's a happy medium

[6:53:01] gyllygan: Yeah you're in Draenor and we're in Azeroth LUL
[6:53:03] b4roud: tell us about 10.0.0
[6:53:04] BoiAtomico: how about universe destroyer space pirate thugs out of stormwind? KEKW
[6:53:04] Nerendis: There was no story in vanilla
[6:53:04] draconisraccoonis: go play starcraft then if you dont like wow, i heard that game is doing really well
[6:53:11] LourageTV: I much prefer personal stories, like witcher 3, thats just me
[6:53:16] Roaringkittylol: ^
[6:53:19] LourageTV: world ending scenarios, boring shit that is repetitive
[6:53:22] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:53:25] draconisraccoonis: then play the witcher
[6:53:28] Rudric_Ice: he did
[6:53:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: there was a story? Kappa
[6:53:43] duhworks: you just did lol
[6:53:44] Airitreya: what do you think about adding more content similar to the klaxxi and the civil war within factions?
[6:53:45] b4roud: btw have you been vaping for a long time?
[6:53:47] Roaringkittylol: Why cant Blizzard do that for WoW @Towelliee
[6:53:49] Rudric_Ice: this music BibleThump
[6:53:55] DrWraithjr: R) why not
[6:53:59] gyllygan: WoW has tons of books and I wish they had a TV series....
[6:54:05] Parsa_KHF: how about demons start coming out of sargarases sword and fucking up the azeroth and we will have dungeons and raids all over the place
[6:54:07] BrutalHermit: GW2 has a pretty good story
[6:54:10] Frank4LuLz: small gang
[6:54:11] TheUnknowing: defias is 2 bit bandits, doesnt matter
[6:54:12] Shugnight: little thief's
[6:54:20] MexicanMisker: @Towelliee do you think forum casuals will like Zereth Mortis? or will they still complain?
[6:54:20] pavepawns: the only thing i personally liked in regards to vanilla was probably the zul gurub lore about summoning a blood god even if it kills them just to take revenge over losing their lands to elves. rest of vanilla was kinda eh. i guess ahn qiraj was okay. but so many goddamn bugs
[6:54:26] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: i would really like to be simpler again with my character and not be the hero all the time,cause its been getting annoying imom
[6:54:26] Geldchef: a knife in the back in nothing to you ?
[6:54:27] DrWraithjr: You can argue they aren't even villans
[6:54:30] Kisswani: it's difference between fighting the Pantheon of Death , and just fighting Jeff
[6:54:31] Douchecakes: they are the tracksuit gang in Marvel
[6:54:32] draconisraccoonis: thank god everyone at home is a game dev and story writer
[6:54:35] lithium364: not true they could steal our credit card information
[6:54:38] Snabido: Tbf they had a juggernaught in their mines, whatever came of that
[6:54:41] sticksaredrifting: turn up music Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:54:42] nokstah10: @Towelliee and the main story of the witcher was a world ending story with the wild hunt
[6:54:44] BoiAtomico: that Vanessa Van Cleef is exotic enough rooBlush
[6:54:45] Snabido: afterwards
[6:54:47] nightwombat: I have always felt an MMO should be more about exploration and lore over story. I play single player games for story. Plus stories in most MMOs revolve around the player being "the one" which never made sense.
[6:54:47] TheCyberKnight: Hello can I chat now
[6:54:53] Alegnowar: i want more allied races
[6:54:56] Rudric_Ice: I hope WE CAN go the the other side of Azeroth in 10.0 NEW TITAN SHIT
[6:54:58] cipusanx: I think people just want multiple down to earth
[6:55:00] tomcruise210: @TheCyberKnight looks like it
[6:55:11] Roaringkittylol: I think the problem is that we are killing Gods at this point and anything less than that will seem underwhelming in comparison. The only way to go is up (kill the creators)?
[6:55:12] ANDYisMAD: I want the Jailer to win and just reset the whole WoW universe LUL
[6:55:18] SicDogg: how did the colts do ??
[6:55:19] AinaTan3: Is hogger a dreadlord?
[6:55:20] Parsa_KHF: @Towelliee  how about demons start coming out of sargarases sword and fucking up the azeroth and we will have dungeons and raids all over the place
[6:55:32] DrWraithjr: It is called fantasy for a reason!!
[6:55:36] woodchuck91: Hoggers Vengence
[6:55:38] belfastcl: @nightwombat different mmos emphasize different things, I think ESO does what you describe (exploration, lore)
[6:55:39] gali5656: big titty titans
[6:55:49] pavepawns: i want a giant celestial dragon trying to consume our entire universe
[6:55:49] Rudric_Ice: GIVE ME TITANS WE NEED MORE
[6:55:58] Alegnowar: down to hearth will be the most boring thing ever, i imagine the complains all over the internet if that happens
[6:56:06] Kisswani: it's why Algalon was great
[6:56:10] instant_savage: superbowl champion titans?
[6:56:12] animulmother: bro i wish it was alittle more simple
[6:56:12] gyllygan: I would like back to down to earth times but like, big villain being a dragon. I'm not a big fan of space demons. The Michael Bay big boobie titans is just so over the top it's ridiculous
[6:56:12] Mazeltough: @Towelliee we are going to have to deal with the scourge at some point now
[6:56:13] cipusanx: one thing is for sure. we aint against body sliders!
[6:56:13] tomcruise210: a bigger deathwing
[6:56:20] Birder_L: You want fruit bowls in space? thats how we get fruit bowls in space
[6:56:24] Roaringkittylol: puzzles suck
[6:56:25] tumb_tack: They certainly could have a system in place called the adventurers of azeroth, where once a patch you explore some aspect of azeroth like defias brother hood etc and introduce a new dungeon or something with it.
[6:56:26] nightwombat: @belfastcl thats why I play classic Wow :)
[6:56:27] AlphasaurusRexx: @belfastcl ESO does that so well. exploration and lore are great in that game.
[6:56:27] Okri24: @Birder_L Lifewing
[6:56:28] Rudric_Ice: KEKW
[6:56:30] duhworks: are we done with the infinity drakes? in wow
[6:56:30] LadyJasmin: there will never be big titties in wow again
[6:56:33] draconisraccoonis: i want spring catalog Eonar getting corrupted and beating azeroth with her void titties
[6:56:36] at1c: talk about side tracked
[6:56:36] tomcruise210: some puzzles are fine
[6:56:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want waffle fries
[6:56:55] tomcruise210: wow jumping puzzles lol
[6:56:58] BoiAtomico: Are you telling me I have to play the game??? LUL
[6:56:59] at1c: imagine diablo without killing
[6:56:59] ANDYisMAD: OSRS has the best Quest's in any MMO
[6:57:00] AinaTan3: Weren't there puzzles quests in Legion, the one with the boxes?
[6:57:00] tomcruise210: like GW2
[6:57:01] FistoTheFistybot: OSRS LUL
[6:57:12] MexicanMisker: i really believe most casuals actually dislike the complicated "puzzle" quests, notice how no one complains about the simple kill X mobs world quests

[6:57:15] DrWraithjr: Legion had those
[6:57:15] draconisraccoonis: we already had bejeweled in Nazjatar, enough with the puzzles
[6:57:16] Rudric_Ice: how about kill 5 something and do a puzzle
[6:57:20] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:57:20] SpoofAvatar: checkers and scrabble
[6:57:24] Parsa_KHF: wow questing is good
[6:57:25] Kisswani: disable DH LUL
[6:57:29] Pubstar_LTD: @ANDYisMAD Yeah but theyre not your main leveling route, theyre more to unluck stuff
[6:57:37] pronkk_: legion puzzle WQ were neat
[6:57:47] tomcruise210: @Kisswani lol yea no dh at all
[6:57:48] Rudric_Ice: Killing while jumping sounds fun
[6:57:56] Sin_GamingTV: lol error 404 quest not found playing DH
[6:58:06] theDirtyon3: LUL
[6:58:13] TheUnknowing: I don't even know why we are acting like story telling is blizz's strong suit any ways lol
[6:58:24] Broomba: pepeMeltdown
[6:58:35] ANDYisMAD: @TheAtomicRam it was tho
[6:58:51] tomcruise210: we need another opening of the gates event
[6:58:51] belfastcl: it's a little on the human starting zone questing style, wow vanilla 2004
[6:58:56] lew_121: New World is a very boring game….
[6:59:10] lgu4na: most mmos have a boring story
[6:59:10] ProClicker: I think SWTOR is still the best MMO for questing
[6:59:11] BoiAtomico: @ANDYisMAD You tagged the wrong person, but I considered replying the same thing LUL
[6:59:16] lgu4na: swtor is good
[6:59:24] DrBubz: swtor is very good
[6:59:25] lgu4na: Wows lore is cool
[6:59:33] lithium364: swtor good example, why not give us atleast something like the class storys from swtor
[6:59:34] ANDYisMAD: @TheAtomicRam hahaha shit my bad
[6:59:40] lgu4na: modern wow
[6:59:45] lgu4na: old wow is incredible
[6:59:48] Rudric_Ice: WoW lore is trash
[6:59:52] AlphasaurusRexx: old wow is dog
[7:00:00] Rudric_Ice: classic had no story whatsoever
[7:00:04] Roaringkittylol: WoW lore needs some help big time.
[7:00:07] lgu4na: warcraft
[7:00:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Star Wars you can make the evil choices sometimes, which is definitely fun
[7:00:21] Kisswani: oh I even prefer SWTOR to FFXIV even , that's how much I enjoy SWOTR story telling
[7:00:22] Nilllan: i think legion lore was cool mop as well
[7:00:22] DrWraithjr: Star wars is better because it is good right away. You don't need to  get 80 hours to get to the good stuff.
[7:00:27] ANDYisMAD: I hate the being the chosen one thing on any mmo
[7:00:33] lgu4na: ^^
[7:00:35] Luckyminten: Shadowlands Story LUL
[7:00:39] Sephirothxz: People dont like wow lore cause it didnt end like they wanted.
[7:00:44] lgu4na: I dont like the "champion" thing wow does
[7:00:44] BrutalHermit: SWTOR is FULLY VOICED. Even your character. Which makes it better than 99% of other MMOs imo @Towelliee
[7:00:53] Sin_GamingTV: Star Wars pissed me off with how the spoken dialog for your choice was NEVER what the actual choice was @Towelliee
[7:00:57] tomcruise210: swtor is literally kotor mmo
[7:01:06] Thoreya: dude i remember people bitching during BC and wrath in terms of how bad the story was. the story was always meh at best
[7:01:26] DrWraithjr: Wrath had an amazing story
[7:01:27] at1c: SWTOR is really good story
[7:01:32] tomcruise210: i cant wait for the kotor remake
[7:01:39] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[7:02:03] Gingerprimer: Wrath Story was good just not amazing IMO
[7:02:17] Rudric_Ice: how many years sylvanas has been the face of WoW now ?
[7:02:22] at1c: Kotor combat is teribole
[7:02:42] tomcruise210: @At1c in the remake they are going away from the turnbased combat
[7:02:49] BoiAtomico: My dudes, the thing about choices in videogames is that you only have the illusion of choice. It's never your decision really, and it always pans out how they want it to go. They elude you that you chose it, but you didn't
[7:03:02] Feldrance: is it better to wait for 9.2 to start wow atm?
[7:03:17] tomcruise210: @eddietcloud now is a good time honestly
[7:03:21] Sephirothxz: @thoreya last expansion is always the worst expansion ever standing on what everyone says no matter how good an xpac is it will always be the worst. Remember Legion? It was considered the worst xpac ever made “Legiondaries rngs on top of rngs””mage tower its impossibile””Argus should have been an expansion”” Tomb or Sargeras its so bad” and so on and now its considered one of the best xpac ever.
[7:03:25] Rudric_Ice: warriors lookin good in 9.2 or nah ?
[7:03:27] 1socket_eth_thresher: need a new fresh!
[7:03:38] tomcruise210: tbh i miss bfa zones
[7:03:40] tomcruise210: and music
[7:03:42] at1c: @At1c I hope so
[7:03:46] lithium364: bring back gladiator spec
[7:03:46] lgu4na: no tom
[7:03:48] lithium364: sadge
[7:03:49] tomcruise210: and reaping flames
[7:03:58] Feldrance: thought class balance was being shaken up with 9.2 coming @tomcruise210
[7:03:59] Alegnowar: nobody said that
[7:04:00] BoiAtomico: @Rudi_Ice Warriors are always good, you just have to bring the big dick attitude to roll with it KEKW
[7:04:09] NinjaGlovz: The end of legion
[7:04:23] ANDYisMAD: The only way I'm coming back to WoW is if they make like a big world reset or something of the sorts of what FF14 did
[7:04:25] Archiee: well I got my bis leggo in week 1 so I had no complaints LUL
[7:04:28] posttheshark: BIG TRUE
[7:04:30] Nilllan: I absolutly loved legion, never had so much fun in wow.
[7:04:31] Kisswani: KEKW
[7:04:32] Brewtality55: revisionist history @Towelliee
[7:04:33] Nilllan: Mop as well
[7:04:37] Nerendis: No one in the history of man has ever said, I wish this was like WoD
[7:04:49] tomcruise210: boralus theme song Kreygasm
[7:04:52] Sephirothxz: @towelliee ahahahah <3
[7:04:54] dreadprince95: I wish this like wod man..

[7:05:00] luckfore: i hope were not gonna say the same about SL when 10.0 is live
[7:05:01] animulmother: haha but no one says that about bfa
[7:05:02] lgu4na: What can they even do with the next expansion?
[7:05:03] Gruffian: Lots of content creators drive views by saying every new expansion sucks. So the hivemind also hates it, and then later realizes hey that was pretty good.
[7:05:08] Kisswani: LMAO
[7:05:12] FistoTheFistybot: I played WoD more than I did SL LUL
[7:05:15] rensdeamo: I agree about 10.0
[7:05:15] posttheshark: star wars prequels seen in much better light now
[7:05:20] Broomba: 10 needs to better and different
[7:05:21] Kisswani: the good old days of spine progression Kappa
[7:05:22] Rudric_Ice: he knows 2020Shhh
[7:05:23] Eraste: danCopium
[7:05:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol Dragon Soul
[7:05:30] Gitmm: bring back dom sockets
[7:05:34] Pubstar_LTD: Its going to be atleast a year before 10.0 right?
[7:05:35] luckfore: maan i wish we could go back to the Maw - us in 2 years
[7:05:45] Jarless: WOD>SL
[7:05:50] tomcruise210: im sad i didnt play wod or legion
[7:05:51] griffdog125: I got them taco bell wings yesturday  not worth the hipe.  was one good one in there the rest had 0 meat and just over fried
[7:05:54] lalelusa: It doesn't even matter to me, how long development & release of 10.0 take. Once it's out, I'll play for a month just to give it a try
[7:05:59] minael1: i still love WoD, but so much wasted potential
[7:06:06] Gruffian: Shadowlands isn't bad, it's just way too slow. Not perfect, but not bad.
[7:06:09] mizerboy: I definitely played WOD more than SL
[7:06:10] rensdeamo: And Blizz have really picked up - they are working on 10.0 as we speak
[7:06:11] Eraste: i definitely played more WoD than SL and i didnt play half of WoD
[7:06:12] Kisswani: @tomcruise210 dont be sad you didn't play WoD , Legion tho
[7:06:12] Sephirothxz: @towelliee when do you think next xpac gonna be announced?
[7:06:21] Loadsofjuice: Do we think 9.2 is soon?
[7:06:26] BoiAtomico: I still love WoD, the expac was bad because it was left mid development, not because of itself. It had great raids and some really neat features! It was also my 1st retail WoW experience, so I may have a bit of bias LUL and a old school love for Orcs from Warcraft 3
[7:06:30] lithium364: the WoD intro quests were really cool ,not includig the garrison bug
[7:06:31] tomcruise210: @Kisswani mostly legion and all the mage tower appearances Sadge
[7:06:40] xrandomdoodx: 10.0 needs to START with all previous lessons learned in the past, and not just rehash the same mistakes until the end of expac hopium
[7:06:45] Archimed87: !armory
[7:06:45] Moobot: @Archimed87 Towelliee's Paladin | worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/illidan/towelliee | Monk | https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/illidan/towellieesan
[7:06:54] board4life65: which features did you enjoy the most wod or SL?
[7:06:55] tomcruise210: @Kisswani wod simply for raiding
[7:07:01] nightwombat: WoD had some major issues, the whole Karabor thing, selfie patch flight, the pvp island, and they pruned classes to death. But everything else was brilliant.
[7:07:08] Rudric_Ice: man i really wish they made a WoD classic but actually finishing the expansion
[7:07:09] Gingerprimer: Legion also had the only cross expansion system we have gotten in a long time in M+
[7:07:09] dreadprince95: I think we would still be complaining.. thats all we do @towelliee
[7:07:12] Sephirothxz: Shadowlands its ok what broke everything was 9.1 people was so eager for content and 9.1 had low content for them even if it was just .1 patch that usually doesnt bring so much content people needed it so bad.
[7:07:14] Luckyminten: There are ppl that like shards of dom LUL
[7:07:14] Shrenko: havent played retail for 10 months feels good man
[7:07:14] AmericanFat: mister towelliee, do you really still dont have this world boss mount ?
[7:07:16] Kinghorn: I quit korthia months ago
[7:07:26] Eraste: i really really hope 10.0 gives me a reason to even consider playing WoW again
[7:07:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Korthia is painful for a lot of us, we are hungry
[7:07:41] tomcruise210: what is the drop chance for nalak?
[7:07:46] Dinosew: If I’m honest as of right now my exp with shadowlands has been way less fun than WOD was, but I still find things I like here and there and that goes for every expansion
[7:07:50] tomcruise210: me too
[7:07:51] Snabido: Sha is the reason he hasnt farmed nalak yet
[7:07:54] tomcruise210: lol im havin a blast
[7:08:00] dreadprince95: just started farming 8 months ago
[7:08:02] Gruffian: Korthia doesnt feel bad NOW, if it was like this the whole time we wouldnt be so burned out on it
[7:08:02] Rudric_Ice: Korthia  is one of laziest and worst zones ever created
[7:08:08] Pippinn: i got it. wod/legion raids. cata/legion reps/"dailies" and shadowlands legos. print ship
[7:08:17] tomcruise210: @Rudi_Ice see the maw LUL
[7:08:32] Kisswani: LUL
[7:08:33] Nerendis: Yeah I love that shit
[7:08:37] englishmdm: hahahah
[7:08:41] Eraste: ya, for me, korthia was their worst content ever made (just imo)
[7:08:43] englishmdm: so true though
[7:08:45] lithium364: the maw killed my friend list
[7:08:55] lalelusa: @lithium364 same
[7:08:59] Kinghorn: LUL
[7:09:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol yeah, it's fun for a few weeks.....if people haven't done it, it's alright
[7:09:02] Niksen_99: I dont know if i should start play Shadowlands again i feel so overwhelmed. dunno where to start
[7:09:03] Kisswani: The only thing I absolutely despise in SL is the Maw , fuck that damn zone
[7:09:06] Luckyminten: @lithium364 same
[7:09:14] Sephirothxz: Shadowlands its an ok xpac but i think people expected it to be more “undead lich king northrend like” xpac the maw and korthia are pretty boring as endgame zone.
[7:09:18] Snabido: On the offensive
[7:09:30] Rudric_Ice: fuck da maw
[7:09:40] Sin_GamingTV: @lithium364 Pretty sure everyone lost a lot of friends to the Maw
[7:09:43] BoiAtomico: it's actually quite fresh to play WoW on a new char with a completely pleb outlook rofl
[7:09:47] posttheshark: I agree with @rektariz
[7:09:49] RaegonGaming: + thorgast
[7:09:56] lithium364: my casual guild ive been playing since cataclysm in got destroyed by 9.0
[7:10:02] GiiGa07: 8.2 was so good
[7:10:03] Gingerprimer: Sanctum is Torghast as a raid
[7:10:22] Gruffian: @rektariz Yeah i did expect more tie in to wotlk like they have done with tbc content. Def.
[7:10:30] Gingerprimer: Castle Was super nice ngl
[7:10:35] lalelusa: the leveling experience and storytelling throughout was wonderful. Then, there was the maw...
[7:10:44] duncon: i was really hoping for a raid that reflected each zone.
[7:10:44] Eraste: 9.2 oribos raid Kappa
[7:10:49] tomcruise210: i loved that raid
[7:11:04] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  that was a great raid imo Castle Nathria
[7:11:06] tomcruise210: denathrius is more badass then the jailer
[7:11:09] Gruffian: @duncon This would have been so cool. And then the final raid is Maw themed or something
[7:11:10] Romnus: To me, the maw aesthetic is now synomonys with covid lmao. SO when I see the maw I think of covid and then I get sad
[7:11:11] Frostfury: Castle Nathria <3
[7:11:15] BattleKnoedel: nathria was great
[7:11:16] Sephirothxz: Korthia and the maw are just boring i mean they are ok but not amazing.
[7:11:16] Jherny: agree
[7:11:21] Jherny: sire was amazing
[7:11:22] dutchie76: 9.2 Date Waiting Room, any guesses Rob? still March?
[7:11:27] Rudric_Ice: Denathrius carried this expansion
[7:11:28] namiswwan_: yea sire was pretty cool
[7:11:36] Gruffian: Denathrius all along
[7:11:41] Ziddrax: not gonna happen
[7:11:45] tomcruise210: the voice actor killed it too
[7:11:50] Luckyminten: It was all a dream, like biggie said LUL
[7:11:50] hnti86: both wanted good for us Kappa

[7:21:32] Bashar_Strygar: @Towelliee  Taliesin has a whole video on this.   Chronicles isn't negated, it is just told from one perspective w/ the info those characters in the lore had.   Shadowlands is told from the Brokers' point of view.   Same base lore still holds true.
[7:21:33] luckfore: might aswell bring afrasiabi back too then

[8:22:35] Kelticlore: what if Azeroth is a First one and reason it couldnt be currpted is cause its a First one
[8:22:38] minho49: waytoodank
[8:22:53] Sprucewayne1: I do think Nzoth used the jailer as a distraction for us.
[8:22:56] CrusaderNero: hah thats just fan speculation. never gonna happen
[8:22:56] Kelticlore: what if Na'Zoth and Jailor are working Together

[8:24:37] OathXP: We stop the Jailer but during the fight it sets reverberations that somehow unlock the void shit or something but the void and light aren't good or bad and we pick a side for borrowed power to seal something new away. Screenshot it
[8:24:45] seqsualurihigiena: maybe sl is an illusion
[8:24:47] luckfore: did nzoth get send to the Shadowlands too after we defeat him
[8:24:55] Froudini: N'zoth bought a 6 month sub and it was part of the deal, including a mount?
[8:24:59] OhNoNotAgain: The void invaded the shadowlands before, so they have the ability to get there.
[8:25:02] snorpytv: why would the void lords/old gods care about what happens in the after life? don't they just want to corrupt "life" aka real time stuff?
