[0:14:21] MediumRareOG: The PC is one step closer to being stolen by a baggage handler

[0:21:50] stephanie23: Good Morning!! It's HUMP DAY!! =)
[0:21:57] TwoAngryFrogs: Morning everyone :S
[0:22:59] TwoAngryFrogs: Saw the post on the Archives and have to agree. But I do wonder if this is a test of some type of new archaeology system in the future
[0:23:00] Lausten: What do you mean? Its the start of the week, wednday is the first day of the week aint it? Have been for half my life now! :O
[0:23:15] Harai_Ulfsark: it also had a rep buff, for BfA at least
[0:23:29] Tidesages: hey mrGM, 10.2.6 are now on the vendor servers, what does that mean "Vendor servers"  I dont get it
[0:23:36] Lausten: But thats when reset is, its clearly the start of the week ;)
[0:23:42] MediumRareOG: there will absolutely be another rep/xp event before pre-patch
[0:23:51] michaelmm: Ohhh controversial!
[0:24:01] michaelmm: I liked it too!
[0:24:02] TwoAngryFrogs: LOL
[0:24:09] Tashasha: So what mounts do have dragon riding now?
[0:24:14] TwipzEU: !drops

[0:24:22] Erinalle: to be fair, I LOVED bfa, I loved farming Island Expeditions for mounts. My guildmates said I'm insane KEKW
[0:24:45] Pumba2988: @TwoAngryFrogs I reckon your right, best way to half test a new ever green system that they can work on in the background and drop it on the 11.0.1 and surprise everyone, i did im an optimist also
[0:24:53] michaelmm: One of the server engineers said in a GDC talk that they are to share the game with Graphics card vendors so they can check their drivers.
[0:25:03] TwoAngryFrogs: Did you see they stealthed in a change to get Mythic level gear boxes in Valdrakken
[0:25:05] MediumRareOG: the vendor servers are so the bot writers can get a head start on their gold farming bots
[0:25:09] Tashasha: But none of the standard ones yet, correct?
[0:25:40] TwoAngryFrogs: At the panda that gives you your key when you don't have one
[0:26:07] 324bee21: You lose it if you die too
[0:26:13] michaelmm: I still have the buff from the spell on my main and it still doesn't expire!
[0:26:32] Lausten: Why is it they keep having time on toy effects like this and the cooldown be the same? NotLikeThis
[0:26:41] Tidesages: there was an articles that WoW gets more dynamice riding,  your opinion on how they will do it on Ground en Water riding ?
[0:26:53] NeeK_23: I was gonna say it wasnt that bad imo for 1h on a 1h CD, but removing on death is silly
[0:27:07] Minobard: the should add dragonriding to my seahorse
[0:27:12] MediumRareOG: why does that toy have a 1 hour cooldown?
[0:27:13] Hotstitute: Ground will probably just have a speed boost
[0:27:30] Hotstitute: maybe a mega leap
[0:27:32] michaelmm: I'm hoping the expiry is just they used a standard toy template and they will hotfix it to persist longer.
[0:27:39] Lausten: Toys honestly need their CDs lowered to 1 minute all over the board, its so dumb
[0:27:43] NeeK_23: wow my shard has 2 people at the dig wtf
[0:27:54] Tidesages: so...whips for ground mounts
[0:27:56] jaggler: indiana bones

[0:28:10] Minobard: Orcealogist
[0:28:21] Fallhayv: I mean, sure, speedboosts, but also jumps, dashes, and stuff like that. They pretty much took dragonriding from Guildwars, could do the same with Guildwars ground mounts like Raptors and shit
[0:28:22] Harai_Ulfsark: excuse me, paleontologist
[0:28:26] ImperfectDark: that shoulder BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
[0:28:39] NeeK_23: can you invite me? its empty here
[0:28:43] Turet78: Turet78 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Hi Dan can't wait for #definitelynopirates patch announcement next week
[0:29:08] BBMezzy: If you're solo in the event you can pretty much guarantee 5 tomes
[0:29:10] lunamists: afternoon :D
[0:29:16] Tidesages: next patch we sail in to the west
[0:29:34] lunamists: not too bad thank you how are you? :D
[0:29:57] Hotstitute: 10.2.6, who cares.. 10.2.7 TIMERUNNING PANDAMONIUMMMMM, SIEGE OF ORGRIMMARRRR
[0:30:29] Hotstitute: ironforges are a thing from teh past.. its not a copyright
[0:30:33] Pumba2988: anyone else here "rewatched" the Blizzcon MEtzen sppech yet, just for a hit of hype?
[0:30:40] jaggler: 10.2.6: Return of the Nightsquall
[0:30:45] Hotstitute: iron smiths use iron forges
[0:30:52] michaelmm: Copyright only covers intellectual property - it doesn't apply if you use it IRL.
[0:30:54] Turet78: I really wonder what that patch could it be especially because it overlaps with season 4.
[0:30:54] ImperfectDark: feel like it has to be a trademark already
[0:30:55] MediumRareOG: WoW didn't invent Ironforge
[0:30:56] headlocks000: "Ironforge" is only copyrighted for the video game, for a gym is a different category
[0:31:20] MediumRareOG: @michaelmm that's nonsense
[0:31:32] Hotstitute: copyright sure covers IRL.... If you make a pokemon doll, that is clearly a pokemon, and sell it, pokemon will be down your throat
[0:31:35] NeeK_23: I bet I cant call my Gym Google
[0:31:44] MediumRareOG: it's not even a little bit true
[0:32:00] TwoAngryFrogs: google is a trademark though
[0:32:10] Hotstitute: i can tell you, dont worry, palworld isnt copyright.

[0:32:25] michaelmm: A doll design is intellectual property tho - a gym is not.!  I think some folks care conflating copyright and trademarks.
[0:32:30] MediumRareOG: there are 2 things: copyright and trademarks. they work differently
[0:32:35] h00rayforstuff: "Iron Forge" is too short to be considered for copyright, it would be trademark.
[0:32:37] Hotstitute: pokemon didnt invent cows... thats the only argument you need to provide
[0:32:43] Harai_Ulfsark: i mean monster energy drinks did try to sue nintendo due to the word monster
[0:32:50] Turet78: fun fact if you reload while digging it resets the animation for everyone so everyone digs in sync
[0:32:52] Tauren0309: Yo Dan our flight tickets are booked for Europe end March...   Overshare I know but exciting times
[0:33:04] Hotstitute: @h00rayforstuff goofy would like a word
[0:33:22] Lausten: They are going to your con Kappa
[0:33:26] michaelmm: Trademark infrigment only applies if you reuse a name in the same kind of business. Using it in another  videogame would be an issue, using it to name a gym would not.
[0:33:37] Tauren0309: France, Switzerland, Belgium and Netherlands
[0:33:42] MediumRareOG: Trademarks generally mean you can't use a name for a competing thing. So Ironforge is a city in a video game. Creating a gym with that name won't confuse anybody that they're the same thing so it's not a trademark infringement, unless they use WoW imagery, fonts, style
[0:33:45] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:33:48] Minobard: Next he opens up a hang gliding company - Stormwind Gliding
[0:33:55] h00rayforstuff: well you left europe remember lol
[0:34:26] Tidesages: @Tauren0309 what are you gonna visit in  the Netherlands
[0:34:33] Tauren0309: Paris, Interlaken, Brussel and Amsterdam
[0:35:24] Tauren0309: @Tidesages Friends moved there from South Africa
[0:35:25] COOP3R: pop down to lauterbrunnen and grindlewald for a visit @Tauren0309
[0:35:46] duckbreadeu: as a belgian, I can confirm belgium does not exist so I don't blame her
[0:35:53] Tauren0309: @COOP3R We actually staying in Lauterbrunned
[0:36:06] COOP3R: very cool, beautiful place
[0:36:17] Tidesages: This Summer Ireland!
[0:37:06] Tidesages: went 2 times for city trip to dublin now withj GF roadtrip through Ireland
[0:37:34] Tauren0309: UK is next year to come long holiday to visit friends
[0:37:38] NeeK_23: not going to UK, they said going to europe xP
[0:37:40] jaggler: why would you visit the UK when you can go to civilized places Kappa
[0:37:52] Turet78: You could come to Hungary just avoid the summer it's like a cauldron on max heat
[0:37:57] NeeK_23: nah its common
[0:38:22] JakeSezz: Doing alright! just about to start work. Hope stream has been well so far saltyb27Cheers
[0:38:25] DevoidX: no thats bulgaria
[0:38:32] dagoxd1986: hungary is landlocked
[0:38:34] MediumRareOG: I'll tell you what's not in Hungary. Food. That's why they're hungry
[0:38:43] NeeK_23: 3 tomes, what slackers
[0:39:03] skewlbeta: what's the river that's running through? the danube?
[0:39:08] TwoAngryFrogs: wow the lag in world events
[0:39:17] Shocklate_: EZ
[0:39:20] ImperfectDark: nice
[0:39:21] Tauren0309: GGGGZZZZ
[0:39:21] NeeK_23: you lucky sob
[0:39:23] Shocklate_: Good morning gamers
[0:39:27] Tidesages: Now go buy a lottery ticket
[0:39:33] NeeK_23: pgeYou pgeNeed ?
[0:39:33] Turet78: @MediumRareOG if I had a euro every time I heard that joke I had 0 because we don't use euro blaming my government
[0:39:49] Harai_Ulfsark: yesterday i got one of the engineer mounts from a blingtron box KEKWAIT
[0:39:53] Frostration_bby: mount is not rare at all, i got it first kill
[0:40:04] unfinanciallystable: Is this BFA or?
[0:40:04] skewlbeta: ;9
[0:40:09] skewlbeta: :( *
[0:40:13] Minobard: bragger
[0:40:14] Shocklate_: Yes it is I, the famous Mizkif video contestant
[0:40:25] MediumRareOG: I got the Silent Glider mount from Soundless yesterday Pog
[0:40:27] NeeK_23: you get.....2nd Rank
[0:40:34] unfinanciallystable: or new DF content?
[0:40:38] dracoress1: Hi, can you pick up the weekly quest for the big dig at the dig, or do you need to pick that up at the archives?
[0:41:04] Harai_Ulfsark: @dracoress1 you can also pick from the adventure guide
[0:41:09] Shocklate_: Guess the Virgin KEKW
[0:41:22] dracoress1: Thanks!
[0:41:41] Verisimi: Hbomberguy video?
[0:41:44] Shocklate_: I made a reaction to it :) I'm going to milk this video for so many views and follows :)
[0:41:53] s7wede: A new week, rank 3 Archives and no new quests and all the relevant transmog bought. By far the worst addition to this game for a while.
[0:42:35] OrangeDan76: Hey.  Thanks for doing drops.  Just to let you know, I started on Twitch because of your YouTube videos.  I've met a bunch of makers on that side of Twitch.  Thanks for bringing me over.
[0:42:40] Verisimi: Thanks!
[0:44:28] TwoAngryFrogs: why not use the selling tab? a lot quicker to post
[0:44:43] TwoAngryFrogs: haha

[0:45:39] Pumba2988: woof
[0:45:39] Harai_Ulfsark: the smoldering one was kinda cool
[0:45:47] unfinanciallystable: how you get currency for that mount?
[0:45:56] s7wede: yeah that fresh PC experience cannot be beat
[0:46:00] MediumRareOG: trust me, it'll still lag
[0:46:02] demiralos: Speccs are you getting?
[0:46:19] Harai_Ulfsark: are you sure? we need to make 2 40 man raids in valdrakken to kill a world boss, just to be sure
[0:46:40] 324bee21: real question, since you ahve to swap everything over can you show us on stream or YouTube how you copy your addons and settings?
[0:47:01] MediumRareOG: @demiralos Look up a Starforge Voyager II Plus. I'm not saying it's that but the specs will be... similar :)
[0:47:04] s7wede: Are you going to keep your old PC as the stream PC and use the new one for gaming?
[0:47:39] 324bee21: dang thanks
[0:48:33] Harai_Ulfsark: i backup my WTF folders into onedrive/google drive once in a while, you never know when you would need that
[0:49:04] TwoAngryFrogs: Is the Zygor achieve guide good? I used their stuff when i was first power leveling when it took forever to level a char back in the day
[0:49:08] s7wede: yeah I have the entire retail folder backed up to a onedrive folder that syncs at 3am every night
[0:49:15] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:49:19] TheRealDjinni: symlinking to your cloud drive is a great idea, just remember to make sure its "available offline" :D otherwise you will run into issues.
[0:49:38] s7wede: it's just a copy
[0:49:46] Harai_Ulfsark: with one drive you can add a folder to automatically sync, but then i prefer to manually back up bc sometimes i will change addons and dont like it anymore and want to go back KEKW
[0:50:08] Harai_Ulfsark: why no dragonrding
[0:50:13] TheRealDjinni: personally, I stopped using a symlink, I just run a batch script every day to copy it to my cloud drive... fewer issues with duplicates/files in use issues
[0:50:46] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:19] TheRealDjinni: but yeah, having your wow folder (even if just interface and wtf folders) on cloud is SUPER helpful for us multi machine users :D
[0:51:29] TheRealDjinni: and good practice anyway for backups :D
[0:51:49] watchmeloze: Hello there, what is your progress looking like? And are you going expac by expac?
[0:51:59] Annathebanana1986: hiii
[0:52:00] Pumba2988: looking at this you only use 2 addons
[0:52:15] TheRealDjinni: always fun when you teach people how to backup their wow folder, and they realise that they can apply those same techniques to other folders they care about :D
[0:52:36] albuquerquez_joze: Hey do u need to do quests in chromie time?
[0:52:58] albuquerquez_joze: to do all the achievments

[0:53:47] Harai_Ulfsark: @TheRealDjinni except when you have 50+ GBs of pictures or videos and then you need to spend money on cloud storage you dont want to :(
[0:54:47] TheRealDjinni: @Harai_Ulfsark 50gb is still in the realm of "I can do that for free" imo.... but yeah I know what you mean.
[0:55:00] watchmeloze: What is your favorite mount ingame?
[0:55:30] JakeSezz: I’ve noticed dragon riding gets a little janky in some old world areas, especially if it’s the first time flying through there
[0:55:31] watchmeloze: They should buff regular mount speed, but keep dragonriding faster
[0:55:33] Lausten: Nah cause its buiild for the speed
[0:55:47] Pumba2988: Will you get access to the alpha this year?
[0:55:48] Harai_Ulfsark: i hope not, they're designing it with dyamic flight in mind since the start right
[0:55:54] BBMezzy: If they do it'll have been a cost saving measure
[0:55:55] TheRealDjinni: @JakeSezz is that when you crossing phasing lines?
[0:56:07] JakeSezz: Like, if I hit Skyward Ascent, it’s delayed by 10-15 seconds
[0:56:15] BBMezzy: Lower max speed means smaller zone needs to be built
[0:56:21] JakeSezz: @therealdjinni Yeah, probably. that would make more sense 😂
[0:56:56] SlithTheSivak: alpha in a monthish?
[0:57:05] Pumba2988: any conjecture on the pirate flag patch>?
[0:57:17] HaloS23: i hope the Earthen are decent size. Not a fan of how small normal Dwarf feel
[0:57:42] TheRealDjinni: @JakeSezz crossing a phasing line at 900% move speed, that was originally designed with max 400% movespeed in mind? :D bound to cause some issues :D
[0:58:02] TwoAngryFrogs: Have to say just not a fan of bejeweled dwarfs
[0:58:10] TheRealDjinni: (my numbers might be a little off, but you get the idea)
[0:58:21] LuiBMHunter: cata removes arrows right? *drool*
[0:58:40] JakeSezz: Yeah I just saw Chunkey’s retweet of that too
[0:58:45] GinkoTheSilverfox: Crazy to me that the game is old enough for Cata to have made it to classic
[0:58:52] SlithTheSivak: por que no los dos?
[0:58:57] TwoAngryFrogs: But would play Nerubian ina  heartbeat
[0:59:36] Lausten: But I dont know if the "artists" who create our games consider it art or just work, so I dont know how to consume it..
[1:00:14] demiralos: Thing is AI Art wouldnt even exist if it wasnt trained on already existing art.
[1:00:32] amricatt: Wow. I dunno what I logged into but wow.
[1:00:40] Harai_Ulfsark: brainrot take
[1:00:40] databob1: Morning who pissed him off
[1:00:41] SlithTheSivak: if that were true AI art wouldnt be a thing...
[1:00:48] skewlbeta: I'm having a great time on palworld
[1:01:14] Lansstuss: ayo GM
[1:01:16] michaelmm: I think there's a difference between a product created for the art and a commercial product. For the former the artists opinions do  matter for the latter it's the consumer's opinions that matter.
[1:01:17] s7wede: It matters to them, but as a individual it should only matter if you support that specfic artist. I don't watch Chick Flicks, why should their opinion on actions movies matter to me.
[1:01:18] Lansstuss: howdy do
[1:01:26] TwoAngryFrogs: It's like when music went all electronic and maintained a prefect 4/4 beat starting in the 2000s. It had no soul. Same with AI art.
[1:01:28] SlithTheSivak: btw, in the discord i linked the mmochamp AI art thread of people characters...i think they're cool, my artist friend is just upset i made them
[1:02:34] SlithTheSivak: it democratizes art in a way that has never existed before...its a revolution
[1:02:47] databob1: @mrgm look out someone's building campfires on your screen
[1:02:58] s7wede: It's a personal or moralistic debate. Nobody has the correct opinion because it's preference. Unless actual legislation is created to deal with AI art, then it's going to ever increasing
[1:03:03] databob1: Very
[1:03:18] MediumRareOG: I'm afraid to listen to Asmon's takes on games lately. 50/50 shot he says something transphobic
[1:03:31] BusterDonuts: @MrGM What do you think about a glyph or some kind of randomization for warlock demons with all the unlocks? What do you think a shop item for a portable barber?
[1:03:48] TheRealDjinni: at some point, AI art is only going to be as good as the prompt engineer and its training data. as art styles change, real artists will be needed again.  Also Artists bring much more to the table than just "producing art" they also bring the creative mindset that allows them to create the art and identify it as being worth using. the AI doesnt do that
[1:03:49] Lansstuss: never heard asmon say anything of sort lol
[1:03:58] BusterDonuts: write it down and tweet about it
[1:04:03] 324bee21: Never heard him say anything unless he was reading a comment from chat to make fun of the chatter
[1:04:03] BusterDonuts: and see if it gets implemented
[1:04:09] Steebadin: He's never said anything transphobic.
[1:04:14] michaelmm: Artists are already using AI (eg Adobe's product) I don't think they are anti AI - they are anti it being used to completely replace human created art.
[1:04:17] s7wede: @MediumRareOG You are confusing his remarks about mentally ill people on twitter / tiktok for his opinion of trans men and women.
[1:04:17] MediumRareOG: Asmon loves to complain about body type 1/2 stuff, saying it injects "politics" into games and nobody wants that
[1:04:26] 324bee21: Real people vs AI I will play the game that is better, or the music that sounds better, etc
[1:04:36] Clodagh_Lunaria: Afternoon!
[1:04:45] Steebadin: @MediumRareOG That's not transphobic
[1:04:50] SkelebobTV: Good afternoon mrgmHey
[1:04:50] 324bee21: @MediumRareOG that's quite the leap to turn that into transphobia
[1:04:59] databob1: What's wrong with furries?
[1:05:00] Lausten: @324bee21 Subjective
[1:05:23] mrsrockguru: afternon @MrGM and chat
[1:05:24] mvpetersen: Morning, just woke up after a night shift HeyGuys
[1:05:58] JakeSezz: Frankly, the more someone rails against something, it def becomes a “doth protest too much” type of situation imo
[1:06:09] 324bee21: @Lausten absolutely, just saying if I find a good fun game but it's 100% ai created I am still playing it
[1:06:45] RAF_Sean: Good morning Dan!
[1:06:54] Lausten: @324bee21 Oh yeah definetly
[1:06:59] RAF_Sean: Just got the best news ever. So can't stop smiling
[1:07:05] s7wede: The only way to win the game is to not play.
[1:07:13] RAF_Sean: VAC sent me the numbers I'll be getting for that rehabilitation program I'm in
[1:07:15] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[1:07:19] RAF_Sean: It's more than I expected
[1:07:43] Lansstuss: people that back up AI art imo are people that want art done for them / their character etc. without having to commission an actual artist with talent
[1:07:49] RAF_Sean: Veterans Affairs Canada
[1:07:50] SlithTheSivak: veterans affairs?
[1:07:54] databob1: As long as it's consenting adults I couldn't  care what they're doing as long as they aren't doing it somewhere that is appropriate
[1:07:54] RAF_Sean: Need to celebrate
[1:07:58] Tidesages: How can we Alliances fly so easy through Dazaralor ?!
[1:08:02] SkelebobTV: @MrGM not played the new patch yet, is dragon riding better for getting around old content now?
[1:08:03] Lausten: Valve Anti Cheat Kappa
[1:08:06] JakeSezz: @raf_sean Is it like the Veteran’s Admin and disability ratings here I. the IS?
[1:08:06] RAF_Sean: LOL
[1:08:08] RAF_Sean: RAF_Sean is gifting 10 Tier 1 Subs to MrGM's community! They've gifted a total of 11 in the channel! 
[1:08:09] RAF_Sean: RAF_Sean gifted a Tier 1 sub to Shocklate_! 
[1:08:09] RAF_Sean: RAF_Sean gifted a Tier 1 sub to NippersWoW!

[1:08:25] SlithTheSivak: thank canada apparently
[1:08:31] Thoreya: @RAF_Sean thanks for the gift sub man!
[1:08:32] Pumba2988: @RAF_Sean Baller <3
[1:08:35] RAF_Sean: Not til February
[1:08:46] RAF_Sean: Yeah backorder
[1:08:46] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:08:55] Lansstuss: @databob1 funny how that's a stand of majority of people, but sometimes ppl of such communities shove it in your face just to get a reaction and attention
[1:09:03] RAF_Sean: It won't be of much use for me on stream but for the podcast it'll be mint
[1:09:24] RAF_Sean: I THINK that a lot of content creators buy new  stuff because they like new stuff
[1:09:35] databob1: Unfortunately AI  is one of those things that shows a weakness on capitalism as a system
[1:09:36] RAF_Sean: Yeah notes and when I'm talking to the guest I'll be actually looking at the guest
[1:09:38] skewlbeta: maintain intense eye contact for the whole stream
[1:09:42] demiralos: AI art is controversial because it is know that people have gotten their art stolen and used for training models to create AI art. Thats why people are skeptic and negative about it. Artists have to make different alpha layers to scrape the image so that it cant be used for AI training.
[1:10:24] TwoAngryFrogs: Well the dogs are staring me down so it must be food time. Have a great day everyone.
[1:10:38] JakeSezz: If the market determines AI art is preferable or allowable, then the natural tenets of capitalism will lead AI art to be less regulated and become a “norm”
[1:10:46] SlithTheSivak: theres apparently a cadre of artists who are attempting to sabotage prompts in AI art
[1:10:52] s7wede: @databob1 Do you honestly think that AI would not exist under socialism or any other market? Things would be exactly the same IMHO
[1:10:55] michaelmm: There's a new product been produced that you can use with your art to "poison" it for AI models.
[1:11:09] FrostBeered: @MrGM Any suggestions for a pandaren warrior name?
[1:11:12] NeeK_23: finding all these dinos can take a few days as not all are always up
[1:11:27] demiralos: Exactly, AI art doesnt create itself out of nothing. It has to be trained to know how to draw things. Thats why you see AI art with 7 fingers. Half of a body vanishes into thin air etc.
[1:11:32] Lansstuss: AngryFluff
[1:11:33] funviking99: Dumpling
[1:11:40] NeeK_23: Padarmswarrior
[1:11:41] Promilie: Generating a single AI image uses as much electricity as fully charging a smartphone
[1:11:42] funviking99: LUL
[1:11:54] JakeSezz: It’s weird cuz it’s kinda crazy that we have tech that can do AI art, but I’m also not necessarily pro-AI art, either
[1:12:02] funviking99: AngryBelly
[1:12:02] NeeK_23: Pandarmswarrior* rather
[1:12:08] SlithTheSivak: @Promilie i make 4 at a time pretty much constantly, all day long
[1:12:19] LuiBMHunter: Could MrGM be replaced by an AI?
[1:12:43] skewlbeta: I think that philosophically if humans aren't working they are making art/being creative. So if we are automating making art what do we do?
[1:12:44] RetroHACK: They have tesla robots folding shirts now, very slow but all jobs are up for grabs in the new tech revolution.
[1:12:49] TheRealDjinni: @Promilie this is the BIG thing that is largely going unnoticed with AI in general! how much power each thing actually consumes. we cosnumers just load it in a webbrowser and it happens in a few seconds, maybe a minute, we dont consider the huge server farm being used to make it happen
[1:12:50] Harai_Ulfsark: i think not, the computer doesnt work alone, someone was using it. but with AI art you literally use other people's work to feed it
[1:12:55] marjonetten: Ragefu might be a fun lil spin on bloodfu :D
[1:12:58] Lansstuss: MrGM can be replaced by an AI, but Dan can't LuvSign
[1:13:03] michaelmm: I think AI will eventually massively change some jobs. But I also think that the current AI is far from ready to do that and the tech bros are overstating how quickly things will change.
[1:13:08] BusterDonuts: ask ai to make a name
[1:13:33] SlithTheSivak: im also earning xbox gift cards generating ai images so...
[1:13:40] JakeSezz: handmade art on a canvas or piece of paper or any other physical medium will always be BiS and evoke emotion. AI art, and frankly photoshop art, elicits less emotion.
[1:13:56] 324bee21: unpopular opinion maybe but if your job can be replaced by AI or machines perhaps you should do your job better
[1:13:56] Harai_Ulfsark: chatgpt comes up with the worst character names
[1:13:57] michaelmm: It's like the "paperless office" of the 1980s - today it's a thing but in the 90's computers were producing more paper than ever before.
[1:14:09] SlithTheSivak: if u use bing, any unique image prompt will generate points, once u get 1000 you earn enough to redeem in the microsoft store
[1:14:27] 324bee21: oh yeah we could go on for hours I wonder if the US election will use it as a talking point this year
[1:14:45] SlithTheSivak: Dall-E 3 is bing, its amazing
[1:14:45] JakeSezz: Soooo many layers. It’s too nuanced for the internet, where civilized conversation goes to die mrgmO
[1:15:18] michaelmm: I predict AI will be blamed for "interfering" in the US elections at some point.
[1:15:18] Crovax45: I think there similiar thing with Ai genrated music, I thought i heard too
[1:15:20] TheRealDjinni: @324bee21 I cant see a scenario where you can sit on any of the fences and come out ontop in terms of votes due to ANY policy on AI....
[1:15:24] SlithTheSivak: ive made 13gigs of ai images of just dracthyr, i have a problem
[1:15:25] Maurdeth: With how AI is able to replicate voices, I wouldn't be surprised to see it become a major political thing.
[1:15:26] Harai_Ulfsark: oh no people will definitely be using deepfake in the next elections, in all countries
[1:15:27] RetroHACK: @324bee21 How do you pack goods better than a robot, can coffee help me pack 20 hours a day?
[1:15:30] TheRealDjinni: doesnt matter if you are for or against it...
[1:15:30] ImperfectDark: i mean, AI scares people who don't understand it so yeah, it'll probably be used during elections to win over simple votes
[1:15:38] CerebrillUK: already dreading watching the election from here in the UK, its nuts at home.  itll probably be focused a lot on the border and ukraine/israel
[1:15:42] MediumRareOG: 2024 election: The Corpse vs the Felon
[1:15:46] demiralos: People have used the gatekeeping-card when people are complaining about them using AI to create art. It's not that anyone wants to stop you from creating art. But you are literally using a model that most likely has been trained on stolen art.  But its also been proven that if you feed AI created materials back into an AI to re-train it gets worse. So you are dependent on having traditional art available to keep training them.
[1:15:47] JakeSezz: And it’s even worse when you’re an American weighing the options of re-enlisting and have little faith in the voting public tneTaliCry
[1:15:53] 324bee21: I mean Trump and Biden are a combined almost 200 years old so hearing them talk AI would be hilarious
[1:16:14] CerebrillUK: @MediumRareOG Trump is only 3 years younger so corpse jr/felon works lol
[1:16:17] 324bee21: @RetroHACK okay in that case then I have to admit those are the types of jobs people should start moving away from in anticipation
[1:16:24] demiralos: 100%
[1:16:32] michaelmm: yes AI will always need humans to create new stuff- they are not capable of doing that!
[1:16:39] SlithTheSivak: if traditional art didnt exist prompts wouldnt work, its all about prose, keywords
[1:16:53] Promilie: What a wonderful future where human beings perform backbreaking manual labour to survive while machines and robots make art and music
[1:16:56] BusterDonuts: before i go down and google fu some stuff; what's the best way to get legion order hall resources? trying to get my class mount
[1:17:08] michaelmm: If you ask Chat GPT it it can replace humans it emphatically says no - and gives a very articulate explanation of why it cannot.
[1:17:08] OnceAMoose: So we need to invoke Fahrenheit 451 to kill all AI?
[1:17:16] RetroHACK: @324bee21 So what jobs do you recommend they move into?
[1:17:20] Harai_Ulfsark: @BusterDonuts do all legion WQs
[1:17:36] s7wede: That is a book, The name is the burning point of paper
[1:17:37] JakeSezz: @onceamoose one of my favorite books of all time
[1:17:42] 324bee21: @RetroHACK something that involves thinking on the fly, dealing with people, something that can't be replicated by a cheap AI
[1:17:44] phopheter: good book that
[1:17:53] OnceAMoose: It's a book/movie where they destroy all books
[1:17:55] Maurdeth: Fahrenheit 451 is a book, and it's not the temperature at which paper burns.
[1:17:58] databob1: @mrgm it's the same as automation taking jobs. While automation is a good thing the fact that people lose their livelihood is also a failure of capitalism its an occurrence that shows flaws in the system no saying that we need to stop using capitalism it's just that it is a faulty system on its own and leaves more and more people behind
[1:18:02] MediumRareOG: Fahrenheit 451 is a famous book about censorship. Book bans are very in rn in the US
[1:18:06] JakeSezz: Fucking amazing book
[1:18:11] Big_Rum: Hello There! I just got the best news! My boss has the flu and I dont have to go meet with him today!!!! now i can watch my dude all morning!!!
[1:18:26] Harai_Ulfsark: @324bee21 oh so uneducated/young workers should just starve, noted
[1:18:47] Big_Rum: Super busy loately at work. a good problem to have i guess
[1:18:47] 324bee21: Your boss probably doesn't think that is the best news
[1:18:48] SlithTheSivak: unfortunately in the US it is
[1:19:02] Lausten: Book bans? So Facism? 🤔
[1:19:02] FrostBeered: @MrGM I went with Bellfield which is a brewery in Scotland
[1:19:02] RAF_Sean: Mr Galiesin
[1:19:09] gypsysupertramp: Go full Tali! tneComradeTal
[1:19:30] JakeSezz: tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal
[1:19:31] ImperfectDark: To be a proper Taliesin chat you need to tell people you effed their moms
[1:19:32] 324bee21: @Harai_Ulfsark I see you're baiting but I'll take it, those people should look to get an education or find a different role yes.  It isn't going to be an overnight thing so people have time now to start preparing for later
[1:19:48] Pumba2988: i never did BFA looks cool
[1:19:55] RetroHACK: @324bee21 Can you think of one? Fast food is becoming automated, retailers are going online as it is cheaper than retail stores, so smaller pool of jobs and more people to fill them.
[1:19:59] Lausten: When did this stream get stormed by policital talk?
[1:20:05] FrostBeered: @MrGM My Pandaren's name
[1:20:12] OnceAMoose: You never go full Bellfield
[1:20:23] Paranigmayt: Hiiiii
[1:20:26] Harai_Ulfsark: @324bee21 nah people will not have time to "educate" themselves fast enough to catch up with AI
[1:20:31] 324bee21: @RetroHACK the person who wired my house and my wife
[1:20:33] mvpetersen: how you get that tomtom to show how to complete achivments? what did i miss? what are the names of addons:D
[1:20:34] RAF_Sean: Automation means more better paying jobs. Instead of hiring a manual laborer to do the task you hire technicians to repair and maintain the systems that do the job. Easier on the body, more pay and more transferable
[1:20:38] JakeSezz: @pumba2988 BFA was good! Especially now that we don’t have to worry about Azerite Armor
[1:21:07] Broximar: 3 raiders from Broximar have joined! 
[1:21:11] 324bee21: @Harai_Ulfsark Jobs are all not going to be replaced in the next 4 years
[1:21:23] WholesomeGames99: hello!
[1:21:30] ShineyFighter: wonder if i can make spooky bread with this grim campfire?
[1:21:33] Harai_Ulfsark: @RAF_Sean you need less technicians to fix a machine than you need manual labors doing all the job
[1:21:33] RetroHACK: @324bee21 Well wifes are becoming automated now as well.
[1:21:34] RAF_Sean: No more jobs, more better paying jobs
[1:21:36] Broximar: Going well. Gotta make sure people get their drops
[1:21:38] ShineyFighter: also Hi dan. sporkySalute
[1:21:47] TheRealDjinni: @RAF_Sean yes... but it also raises the barrier to entry... you have to KNOW a lot more before you can be useful in the workplace...
[1:22:09] Harai_Ulfsark: addon is cooking
[1:22:10] ShineyFighter: not much just doing fishing dailys.
[1:22:19] Lausten: M+0 gear
[1:22:22] ShineyFighter: sporkyWut oh noz
[1:22:28] Clodagh_Lunaria: @Broximar  clodagMewave clodagMewave
[1:22:31] MediumRareOG: 441 is heroic
[1:22:33] xwowkillax: power button monkaS
[1:22:43] ShineyFighter: you need a mouse mat on top of that button.
[1:22:54] Erinalle: threatening you LUL
[1:22:56] Big_Rum: Have you ever heard of the band Nerd Out? Their music is great
[1:23:04] ShineyFighter: sporkyLOL
[1:23:30] Tidesages: its a nice day to get archievments
[1:23:38] Tidesages: 24/1/24 hahah
[1:23:38] Big_Rum: I believe its all DMCA free too. They make songs about animae and video games Punk and Rap Vibes
[1:23:38] JakeSezz: I found some banger synthwave tunes on YouTube while streaming last night
[1:24:16] phopheter: what are your streaming friends streaming ?
[1:24:52] 324bee21: so bitter about the Drake toy, but the Twitch Campfire has ZERO cooldown lol
[1:24:56] databob1: @mrgm we need a more mixed system that focuses more on caring for people that would normally fall through the cracks but nether party in the US will ever do that
[1:25:03] Reminii91: new patch and stuff
[1:25:03] NeeK_23: it had a minor patch last week too
[1:25:09] albuquerquez_joze: New story coming
[1:25:09] 324bee21: there is a new patch coming out I think
[1:25:18] FrostBeered: There's a new expansion for skyrim online or whatever its called

[1:26:49] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:26:52] Pumba2988: one game*
[1:26:53] GinkoTheSilverfox: Nothing wrong with focusing on your favorite game
[1:26:54] Lausten: I watch wow I dont follow trends, couldnt care about pokemon copy or what ever that game is
[1:26:57] Steebadin: I'm a 1 game person as well
[1:26:58] ShineyFighter: i heard Nintendo will sue the guy who did that mod for adding pokemon into Palworld unless he takes it down. sporkyOwO ~
[1:27:18] JakeSezz: I, too, appreciate that I can hop into stream and you’re playing WoW.
[1:27:18] spencer_zero_: Still looks so wild seeing you dragonflying through BFA zones.
[1:27:19] Saiyarina: lol, here the same. sometimes a facebook game, but 90% of the time, only wow
[1:27:22] Arlaeya: It depends on goals... do the thing you love. The people who appreciate it will find you
[1:27:27] spencer_zero_: WoW is your comfort game.
[1:27:31] ShineyFighter: everyone always comes back to wow.
[1:27:49] MediumRareOG: WoW is like a warm blanket... witha montly subscription... and micro-transactions
[1:27:59] Lausten: WoW is love WoW is life. <3
[1:28:01] NeeK_23: if War Within and Dawn Trail launch in the same month it's gonna be rough for alot of streamers and players. I wonder if either Blizz or Squenix will blink and move dates
[1:28:03] FrostBeered: Wow is just fun, there's always content to do
[1:28:11] MachoCham: Lurking. Gimme dat drop
[1:28:15] Arlaeya: WoW is my favorite hoodie
[1:28:22] xwowkillax: other games DansGame
[1:28:38] lilkenzies: wow is also the only game i play :p
[1:28:51] JakeSezz: meeting time so I’ll be lurking as well saltyb27Cheers
[1:28:57] JakeSezz: !lurk
[1:29:03] RAF_Sean: FWIW I typically don’t tune in to streamers I follow/enjoy if they shift off Warcraft (I’ll make some exceptions for other Blizzard games)
[1:29:03] MachoCham: Where you stuck?
[1:29:11] MachoCham: @RAF_Sean Ditto!
[1:29:16] RAF_Sean: So for this viewer I’m glad you’re a one trick 😉
[1:29:19] Pumba2988: WoW is safe, spaghetti code is better than ai optimized new games like Palworld. could be mining crypto on your GPU and you wouldnt have a clue
[1:29:20] Lausten: Big Dig starting now
[1:29:21] NeeK_23: If Im not in wow, then I play MTGA or BG3, Dont have time for more than those
[1:29:24] xwowkillax: i have tried other games for years and always passed on wow but wow is my main game nowadays FeelsGoodMan
[1:29:56] spencer_zero_: I like it when it rains in WoW. Very cosy.
[1:29:57] ImperfectDark: i've so many games to play but all i wanna do is farm WoW mounts and stuff
[1:30:09] MachoCham: It's fun, have some crypto on me
[1:30:35] RAF_Sean: lol @machocham
[1:30:41] NeeK_23: most BFA can be done with level 1 pets so you should be fine
[1:30:48] spencer_zero_: We're British so we have to appreciate the shit weather.
[1:30:54] hyondhu: youre porbably the coolest looking dwarf ive ever seen TwitchConHYPE
[1:30:57] NeeK_23: if not use ikky

[1:32:23] NeeK_23: ikky and iron starlette
[1:32:37] ShineyFighter: you need level 25 pets...
[1:32:56] bwoods79: With twitch do you get a breakdown of how much you make from people with twitch turbo vs from subs?
[1:32:57] FrostBeered: mrgmToast
[1:32:58] Lausten: We are
[1:33:00] ShineyFighter: sporkyIsFine this is fine.
[1:33:30] FrostBeered: Does blizzard get you to make videos?
[1:33:47] bwoods79: just wondering how good the income was from turbo vs individual subs
[1:33:52] Big_Rum: That would be awesome though
[1:33:57] demiralos: Not yet is the correct answer
[1:34:04] FrostBeered: they should, you're way more pleasant than the people they use
[1:34:21] bwoods79: you just need a catch phrase like kelani
[1:34:26] ShineyFighter: Kalani use to do videos for GW2.
[1:34:32] FrostBeered: I miss Lore
[1:34:35] Big_Rum: Did you see our boy Shocklate showing up in a Mizkif video?
[1:34:40] ShineyFighter: was a good time.
[1:34:53] NeeK_23: Lore is making videos again on SoD
[1:35:11] ShineyFighter: that was fast. O.o
[1:35:17] bwoods79: I was never really that much into lore but i like how bellular does lore
[1:36:10] ShineyFighter: sporkyPop om nom nom
[1:36:24] hyondhu: is it fun to get wow to 100%, cause ive seen someone yesterday in star wars the old republic doing chievos like: kill 5k mobs on a planet InuyoFace
[1:36:28] HaloS23: Nobbel87 is my lore goto
[1:36:47] RAF_Sean: Can you kick me a link Neek?
[1:37:07] amricatt: I go to Nobbel myself.  There's something about Bellular that makes my eyeballs itchy.
[1:37:24] HaloS23: @amricatt same!
[1:37:41] bwoods79: I love viva la dirt leagues latest video... they start out talking how they have a normal day to day grind at work and they hate it..then in game they have to go mine 1000 ores for some npc
[1:37:53] xwowkillax: DansGame
[1:38:01] lilkenzies: i just dont like the new dragon mounts i prefer oldies but goodies
[1:38:01] amricatt: He just makes me cringe a lot
[1:38:06] demiralos: Means his eyeballs itch
[1:38:31] mrRobocto: Zygor?  Is that an addon?  I've never seen that before

[1:44:14] Erinalle: Give it time, my, back then, 2 yo nephew was playing POE for me... cyclone build so only one key required LUL
[1:44:19] amricatt: Ah, Dan solved it.
[1:44:25] Pumba2988: knowledge is power thanks Dan
[1:44:47] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:44:58] FrostBeered: I wish Twitch ads were for games not tampons
[1:45:28] Erinalle: then we he was 3/4 we started playing Spyro, i rebinded fire key so he could just spam it, then he learnt how to run etc. by 5 he was able to play spyro all alone LUL
[1:45:29] FrostBeered: yup
[1:45:36] FrostBeered: that and doordash
[1:45:36] amricatt: I use it and love it.
[1:45:37] RAF_Sean: Love Twitch turbo
[1:45:38] Erinalle: when*
[1:45:38] GinkoTheSilverfox: I have it
[1:45:40] Lausten: #TurboRepresent
[1:45:44] stellabellas: love twitch turbo... it's nice
[1:45:48] RAF_Sean: Huge fan and been a user for a long while
[1:45:50] adampanerabread: just responding to the whole lore/patch thing, if you want to go over it you can! i'd probably want to include the context of the map stuff i sent you before
[1:45:57] RAF_Sean: No ads on any stream
[1:45:59] amricatt: I like to jump around and see different creators in the afternoon.
[1:45:59] xendros78: I've been using twitch turbo for several months, highly recommend
[1:46:08] xendros78: no ads anywhere, so you can surf all you want
[1:46:11] RAF_Sean: Any time a stream runs ads you count as a viewer still for the streamer
[1:46:12] stellabellas: no ads, plus streamer does get payout for it as well
[1:46:13] amricatt: No ads at all
[1:46:15] adampanerabread: I can find it rq
[1:46:16] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:46:23] RAF_Sean: and iirc you count for more value than a non-turbo viewer
[1:46:23] GinkoTheSilverfox: I can still support people without subbing, no ads, and longer storage on VODS, perfect for me
[1:46:31] Pumba2988: Twitch Turbo is cost effective for no ads over all streamers. But you don't contribute as much as a prime sub for example
[1:46:36] NeeK_23: downside no emotes
[1:46:44] xwowkillax: im sick of ads on the internet period they are so annoying cant even browse youtube without ads in the search results
[1:47:11] Xspectia: isn't it under silithus?
[1:47:22] D4v1d7w17ch: oh, instead of from the capital cities !!
[1:47:59] NeeK_23: 10.0.7
[1:48:00] adampanerabread: forbidden reach
[1:48:06] Maurdeth: Forbidden Reach, yeah.
[1:48:06] mrsrockguru: squall forbidden reach
[1:48:12] MachoCham: Ulda revamp mentioned it as well too
[1:48:19] MysticalOS: i like red shirt guys theory. noting how many docks they added, that are currently unused. no boats, no activity. yet they specifically added one to gilneas and bel. where do these docks travel to.
[1:48:30] Thoreya: thatd be cool
[1:49:18] Lausten: Thats been my theory for 10.2.6 all the time ever since I saw the pirate flag
[1:49:28] NeeK_23: they always said no pirates in 11.0. They never said no pirates in DF
[1:49:30] Fibnkak: wow  lets trust a adventuring pirate to lead us to a safe place LOL
[1:49:31] Paranigmayt: 10.2.7 will come after S4, 10.2.6  will come when? :D
[1:49:50] Thoreya: @Paranigmayt prob in like a month
[1:49:51] Tidesages: sorry night school?
[1:49:57] adampanerabread: also the point about the map
[1:50:06] FrostBeered: Do you think its about time they just made it an option to choose horde or alliance but you can pick whatever race you want for either
[1:50:12] adampanerabread: that it's located randomly on the dragonisles instead of where the docks are
[1:50:18] adampanerabread: because we didnt have bel'ameth yet
[1:50:20] Paranigmayt: @Tidesages Would be cool. The content vom 10.2.5 was not that worth the waiting
[1:50:46] Sukodin: @MrGM Think maybe 10.2.6 will have something to do with the earthen?  Since they are a new race, any chance we get the intro prior to the launch so people can level them up?
[1:50:59] phopheter: what a distance to travel, just sail from townlong KEKW
[1:51:11] databob1: Picking any race for ether faction would be great
[1:51:12] amricatt: So we're thinking 10.2.6 is part of the pre-WWI story?
[1:51:18] Tidesages: So if i understand it correct, we gonna get some World Events that learn us to ride the seas ?
[1:51:20] Arlaeya: slow burn is what I'm hoping for too.
[1:51:35] FrostBeered: I think they should rebuff the raids in this expansion, get people running the old raids
[1:51:36] SlithTheSivak: itd make more sense to launch from belameth but that looks like the dock we take the zep to get to the dragonisles
[1:51:49] FrostBeered: for people who want to get the drakthyr legendary
[1:52:04] Tidesages: I gonna grab my Jar of Dirt
[1:52:14] MachoCham: It does feel like that we need to fix whatever is causing the storms
[1:52:19] Lausten: What if the journey is actually up north and coming up from down below instead of sailing all through the map?
[1:52:24] str4ysheep: with boat riding instead of dragon riding, sure
[1:52:25] NeeK_23: usinging Islands are scenario questing as we search for Khaz Algar
[1:52:40] KerrorIND: Hi/any info from ptr?
[1:52:43] Maurdeth: Given what we got with Gilneas, Bel'ameth and the epilogue, I dare not hope.
[1:52:49] MachoCham: And now we have a Storm Aspect...
[1:53:04] Tidesages: Tel'Abim!
[1:53:10] WSilverHawkW: @FrostBeered Isn't S04 gonna be old raids going in rotation? so every 3 weeks you can play current gear raid and a chance to get it
[1:53:17] StreamElements: Reclaiming GILNEAS in 10.2.5! Complete Story Playthrough & Rewards - https://youtu.be/C-QpageNFY0
[1:53:32] Fibnkak: @Tidesages 11.2 better be there
[1:53:42] Lausten: I got a feeling we will be seeing Tel'Abim soon due to how we saw them teased in the Emerald Dream as far as I remember
[1:54:32] adampanerabread: i think it was in the what's next
[1:55:03] Fiamma: 166 raiders from Fiamma have joined! 
[1:55:07] Fiamma: fiammaHype fiammaHype YOU'RE BEING RAIDED BY THE FIAMILY!!! fiammaHype fiammaHype
[1:55:12] Darabelia: good day MrGM
[1:55:19] Fiamma: hehe
[1:55:28] druidhex: Anyone know how twitch drops work if there is no active sub?
[1:55:37] SlithTheSivak: mrgmZ mrgmKEKW mrgmZ mrgmKEKW mrgmZ mrgmKEKW mrgmZ mrgmKEKW mrgmZ mrgmKEKW mrgmZ mrgmKEKW
[1:55:38] Darabelia: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[1:55:39] Fiamma: Thank you fiammaHug It's so terrible and I love it
[1:56:11] MithRevan: @druidhex I can confirm that
[1:56:21] karklop: @druidhex yes! and I always log in with a level 20 character to see it in game
[1:56:26] Matrixovershock: very wierd way to get there haha
[1:56:39] KerrorIND: so Atherot is flat?
[1:56:41] Fibnkak: the radiant song.  Why can't the horde have a launch point from gadgetzan?
[1:56:41] SlithTheSivak: should launch from Gadgetzan...also missed opportunity they didnt update Gadgetzan to be like the Hearthstone version...
[1:56:46] Fiamma: Fee-ah-ma, close :D It's Italian for flame, I am not Italian
[1:57:20] Xspectia: flat azeroth deniers don
[1:57:28] Xspectia: don't @ me
[1:58:04] Matrixovershock: If I log in Patch day and Wyrmbane is all like "Yo, we got pirates. Grab yer ship, we sailing" my day will be made haha
[1:58:26] MithRevan: Before Malfurion returned this patch, I had a small hope that we'd return to the SL (Skull means death) and do quests that bring Malfurion and Vol'jin back; but I was hoping that cause I didnt want Vol'jin's return to be the Darkspear Heritage (it needs to be available to everyone)
[1:58:30] S3N71: Good afternoon MrGM.  Fiamma  streamed longer than usual, sorry I'm late ;-)
[1:58:46] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[1:59:01] skewlbeta: I really need to re-watch black sails. I've had pirates on the brain....
[1:59:17] Matrixovershock: very odd
[1:59:31] phopheter: unless it's lumped in with "world events"
[1:59:39] Fibnkak: @skewlbeta give me that shimsraw opening for the pirate expansion
[1:59:43] adampanerabread: dragonflight had a little bit with uldaman and what not
[1:59:44] Matrixovershock: i thought normally a event happens?
[1:59:46] blazhevski: do you think theyre cooking up something "big"?
[1:59:48] S3N71: I think a couple have
[1:59:49] BusterDonuts: @MrGM alright boss, is there an addon you use for legion class hall mission tables?
[2:00:01] jaggler: i would guess pre-patch-event would be a "world event"
[2:00:16] SlapControl: Pre patches have some story quests, BFA had a bunch
[2:00:16] skewlbeta: @Fibnkak I re-watched the opening scene just a few weeks ago and having watched the whole thing was just re-blown away.
[2:00:24] amricatt: There's typically some story cross over, right?
[2:00:44] S3N71: S3N71 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Fiamma! They have given 218 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:00:45] skewlbeta: @Fibnkak "Don't you think we've done enough?" Is such a good opening line for that character
[2:00:46] adampanerabread: shadowlands had the whole ICC thing
[2:00:56] shimwood: DF pre-patch was killing the elemental storms
[2:01:03] Fiamma: Awww, thank you @S3N71!!
[2:01:11] JakeSezz: I believe so…
[2:01:18] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[2:01:24] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah we had 2 weekly quests progressing a story of sorts in ICC for SL prepatch
[2:01:40] phopheter: bfa pre patch was around azerite and the sword
[2:01:51] phopheter: legion pre patch involved the DHs being released
[2:01:52] michaelmm: BfA had the whole war of thorns questline spread over 3 weeks.
[2:01:52] Fiamma: Haha, yup! Or Fia if that's easier :)
[2:01:56] Lausten: What sword?
[2:01:58] hi_im_kage: cant wait for lvling all my alts in war within prepatch
[2:02:02] jaggler: BfA pre-patch was the big campfire of happiness
[2:02:14] Fiamma: I am yeah :D Thank you!
[2:02:18] Matrixovershock: the giant toothpick sticking out of azeroth
[2:02:18] Fiamma: I am Aussie yeah
[2:02:29] S3N71: She's an absolute legend :)
[2:02:40] Fiamma: I wanted that shirt so bad.
[2:02:48] Fiamma: fiammaHug
[2:02:49] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:03:05] Pumba2988: im going full alt army next expac, gotta take advantage of the warband system.
[2:03:23] JakeSezz: I mean, ya boi will be in England in March and I could order it and bring it with me saltyb27Cheers saltyb27Cheers
[2:03:25] Zuldak: might be cheaper to fly to the US and pick up the shirt rather than paying freight
[2:03:33] S3N71: I need a warband system that can handle three EU accounts
[2:03:33] Fiamma: It's gross. BlizzANZ had a giveaway package that included the shirt, but we don't get local stores >.<
[2:03:40] Mrs_Muffyn: I wanted it SO bad aswell
[2:04:02] Fiamma: That's such a great idea with the PC haha
[2:04:21] S3N71: Dan, I'm gonna AFK, need a hot bath, I'll be back
[2:04:22] FrostBeered: does uk amazon have the shirt?
[2:04:31] Fiamma: I think we used to have a store but I don't think we get one at all any more
[2:04:47] handovdoom666: there's lots of places that in the US, you order a bunch of different things and ship them all to one location, they bundle them together and ship it freight to save you $$$ if you are international.
[2:04:59] Fiamma: He does, bucketloads at once to justify the shipping I think lol
[2:05:13] Shocklate_: That jersey being $90 is a crime man KEKW I just cant bring myself to spend that much
[2:05:17] ShineyFighter: quick everyone order pizza to dans place.
[2:05:23] Fiamma: @handovdoom666 They still charge a fortune, just slightly less of a fortune
[2:05:24] FrostBeered: they have it on the canadian one
[2:05:28] ccatalysttt: Hellooo mrgm
[2:05:34] FrostBeered: but that dosen't help you

[2:06:18] FrostBeered: maybe I could have it shipped to you?
[2:06:18] Zuldak: random question: is Charles' face on the pound yet?
[2:06:37] NeeK_23: do Aussies like the king? I think theyre kinda meh on him
[2:07:01] skewlbeta: Do brits? Lol
[2:07:02] Elrathir: do anyone?
[2:07:02] michaelmm: They've printed coins and notes with his face but there's very few in circulation yet.
[2:07:03] jaggler: who likes the king?
[2:07:05] Fiamma: I mean there are millions of us, I think we all have different opinions heh
[2:07:06] ccatalysttt: Feels like the english populace would throw a fit if they tried to take the queen off bills
[2:07:06] NeeK_23: Bermuda left
[2:07:11] Na_kaH: C'MON QUEENSLANDER !
[2:07:14] skewlbeta: Americans do lol
[2:07:17] Lausten: Brits likes no one Kappa
[2:07:19] FrostBeered: the store that sells it is in china
[2:07:34] Grzmocillla: @MrGM how do you use this new script from outland racing ?
[2:07:47] NeeK_23: Spokesperson of Canada, new title @RAF_Sean
[2:08:53] MediumRareOG: just the most average inbred billionaire 21st century monarch
[2:08:53] FrostBeered: lol I'm going to get one
[2:08:59] Matrixovershock: ughh i need that button up
[2:09:10] Zuldak: there was  a thing that said men think about the roman empire daily
[2:09:12] RAF_Sean: Holy shit
[2:09:15] Lausten: Change the size
[2:09:18] ccatalysttt: Feels like the monarchy is just there for publicity because they own most of the land in the country lol
[2:09:37] Mrs_Muffyn: O.o
[2:09:40] Matrixovershock: .....what the heck
[2:09:47] michaelmm: US prices don't include sales tax (their VAT)
[2:09:49] Lausten: The EU store chaged the price depending on size last I checked felt ripped off for being a grown up
[2:09:54] Zuldak: always buy clothes in 3XL to get the most fabric for your money
[2:09:58] Matrixovershock: and its only like a 25$ shirt too
[2:09:59] handovdoom666: FIRST WE DUMP YOUR TEA, NOW WE CHARGE YOU EXTRA FOR BUTTON UP SHIRTS #revolution
[2:10:00] MediumRareOG: FWIW the $70 doesn't include sales tax, which can be another 10%
[2:10:06] michaelmm: it's £60 excluding VAT.
[2:10:10] skewlbeta: yeah sales tax isn't quite $20
[2:10:17] Lausten: It changed price from S to 2XL
[2:10:35] FrostBeered: Its $23 here
[2:10:40] Lausten: A hoodie did
[2:10:48] ccatalysttt: It's the "accent" tax. If you get a cooler voice, you have to pay extra for it
[2:10:48] Lausten: I felt discriminated
[2:10:59] skewlbeta: @MediumRareOG not quite that bad. Usually only about 6% on average
[2:11:04] KrathiumWoW: still no War Within collectors edition on gear store :(
[2:11:06] Lausten: Yeah I was surprised as well
[2:11:10] Alerothan: Well the bigger ones DO take more material lmao
[2:11:39] Lausten: It 100% happened for what ever I was looking at last time
[2:11:47] amricatt: The US will make the bigger ones more expensive in some stores.
[2:12:05] Alerothan: Yea
[2:12:06] phopheter: yes
[2:12:06] Matrixovershock: that is

[2:45:07] bobbybird92: now that a bunch of classic dungeons are replayable the way they were back then, do you think we might get timewalking classic? maybe with naxx as a tw raid?
[2:45:10] Fibnkak: Trolll beards are Amish beards right?
[2:45:14] Lausten: They only upped it from 50 to 60 when we got Dracthyr, I feel like its so dumb, why not just make it 100..
[2:45:16] Pandachoww: i could not help it XD
[2:45:40] treman1990: what is that tracker on your screen?
[2:45:47] Fibnkak: and he died for it
[2:45:50] Harai_Ulfsark: voljin and a bunch of troll bosses
[2:45:57] MaharatD7: probably add more slots in pre patch with warbands added
[2:46:08] FrostBeered: dwarf females need beards
[2:46:26] Lausten: Not true Dan!
[2:46:31] Zuldak: I hope we are going to be able to custimize the camp
[2:46:33] Lausten: Warbands cant show across servers
[2:46:34] funviking99: so if you have like 20 alts they will show there?
[2:46:38] Matrixovershock: going to be nice, but hell for those of us with like 50 chars on so many servers haha
[2:46:42] amricatt: @FrostBeered The Earthen having beards make me hopeful that they will add it to the rest of the dwarves.
[2:46:44] Eggz1004: @treman1990 if you're talking about the thing in the bottom right near his bags, its called ALL THE THINGS
[2:46:50] Sujis: They do show across servers
[2:46:51] Pandachoww: i actually miss kings rest
[2:46:55] Pandachoww: such a good m+
[2:46:59] havoom01: so did we found out if there is any purpose of azerothian archives rep?or just for achievment and thats it?
[2:47:00] Sujis: I remember that as well
[2:47:00] treman1990: ty
[2:47:06] ShineyFighter: sporkyHeart so good <3
[2:47:07] Matrixovershock: how many can they fit on a screen then? and is it only max level toons?
[2:47:08] Zuldak: yeah they do, you no longer have to deal with jumping to log into realms
[2:47:30] Lausten: They already said so, it works cross servers, but it wont show on the login screen cause what happens if Tarren Mill is down for maintenance but Draenor is not?
[2:47:33] Pandachoww: if only i could have my na and eu character in one place! :'(
[2:47:44] Lausten: Warbands are server specific
[2:47:44] Pandachoww: *characters even
[2:48:01] S3N71: @Pandachoww I pray for that day
[2:48:06] Lausten: They are all on the same server
[2:48:09] IAmScarlett__: its cross-server lmao
[2:48:12] amricatt: @Lausten They are not server specific.  They are account specific.
[2:48:14] Kindosar: he did say that you don't have to change between servers to select characters, they're all in one place
[2:48:19] IAmScarlett__: @Lausten no they arent
[2:48:22] Harai_Ulfsark: its very unusual that one realm is down while other is up in the same region
[2:48:25] Fiamma: No reason they can't just grey out a character name if that server is down
[2:48:26] S3N71: cross-region, that's what we all want
[2:48:41] Fiamma: See how there's no server select button? :D
[2:48:57] Matrixovershock: ohhh so the rest are off screen in a list. you choose a select few to show on login
[2:49:09] MediumRareOG: I wonder how warbands will work with RP and non-RP realms
[2:49:19] Pandachoww: @S3N71 would be so nice!
[2:49:20] Zuldak: I hope someday we can play with multiple characters at once kinda like tag in systems in fighting games
[2:49:29] NIICKLAS_TV: POGGERS
[2:49:36] NIICKLAS_TV: KEKW
[2:49:40] xwowkillax: KEKW
[2:49:41] IAmScarlett__: thats super embarassing-
[2:49:41] Kubwa7: ooooo...that's awesome
[2:49:46] Matrixovershock: how long is that scroll bar going to be for some of us though hahaha
[2:49:50] Harai_Ulfsark: me as i spread misinformation in chat CrabPls
[2:49:51] amricatt: mrgmHehe mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[2:49:51] NIICKLAS_TV: he was so sure of it too
[2:49:52] GewruTV: Why do servers even exist in 2024
[2:49:53] ijuki: Rekt?
[2:49:55] funviking99: so how will they show all my 40 alts on the screen?
[2:49:58] ShineyFighter: sporkyLOL
[2:50:03] Pandachoww: absolutely....told
[2:50:08] Fiamma: @funviking99 Biiiiiig scroll bar
[2:50:08] Rarazaran: it show chat but it gonna be gray on unavailable
[2:50:11] Zuldak: @GewruTV there are sharding implications
[2:50:15] Lausten: @GewruTV Duplicate names
[2:50:17] S3N71: @funviking99 Top 4 I think
[2:50:23] Eggz1004: @Matrixovershock i could probably watch a full length movie before getting to the end of mine
[2:50:24] Zuldak: also AH for non commodities is still server based
[2:50:25] mysterymato: auction house lol
[2:50:25] bettys_dungeon_adventures: @GewruTV ian did say they were open to getting rid of servers down the line
[2:50:26] MediumRareOG: Good to know evokers will start at 10. I need to create a bunch at 58 before then
[2:50:38] funviking99: I see
[2:50:38] Lausten: They said different in other interivews, I'll find it
[2:50:48] Matrixovershock: @Eggz1004 Same! maybe the whole LOTR trilogy, extended. haha
[2:50:51] IAmScarlett__: @Lausten no they didnt
[2:50:52] Lausten: That is a concept art
[2:50:55] GewruTV: you can shard across multiple realms they already do it with cross realm gameplay. so that is for sure not the holdup
[2:50:57] fooxytv: how will that work?
[2:50:58] Lausten: Not a working product
[2:50:59] IAmScarlett__: you got told and cant handle that youre wrong
[2:51:04] Matrixovershock: to be fair, on stage, he said Concept. and Concept means it can change.
[2:51:04] fooxytv: so server specific is gone?
[2:51:14] Zuldak: uhh it was the deep dive at blizzcon and seemed to be a pretty major point of the warband
[2:51:33] dright424: guilds are going to be cross realm too, so no need to keep realm specific list
[2:51:33] Lausten: But you gotta select a realm to make your character on, thuis realms still exist
[2:51:42] Harai_Ulfsark: @fooxytv the barriers between realms are being teared apart, they'll remain just to avoid duplicate names.. probably
[2:51:52] ijuki: The servers will be there, but you do not have to jump between the servers to find your characters
[2:51:54] IAmScarlett__: @Lausten that wasnt what you said
[2:52:05] Eggz1004: gotta hit the gong
[2:52:16] Zuldak: Realms will still exist but you wont have to server hop over to log over between characters
[2:52:26] fooxytv: @Harai_Ulfsark ah okay that makes sense
[2:52:32] mmac27: I wonder if they have to be the same faction I hope not
[2:52:33] SiRacer420: hey I’m running my alt army through kings rest right now too. just got the underrot one and the freehold one yesterday.
[2:52:47] Matrixovershock: oh man i have too many characters on to many servers haha. my list gunna be long.
[2:52:53] Harai_Ulfsark: @mmac27 nah it will also be cross-faction
[2:53:04] Zuldak: they said the screen is limited to 5
[2:53:06] Zuldak: in the camp
[2:53:13] Kindosar: it'll prob just be the top 4
[2:53:17] fooxytv: did Ion mention the limit around the camp fire?
[2:53:18] Pandachoww: ive actually finally limited myself to 1 server on each now...finally
[2:53:20] Tashasha: Does anybody from the EU play on US servers? We are moving to the EU and I would like to keep my current characters, just wondering how bad the lag would be to play on US servers.
[2:53:21] RetroHACK: It is very lost ark style
[2:53:22] amricatt: I think they said you can select the ones hanging out.
[2:53:25] Zuldak: you choose which ones are in the camp
[2:53:25] Matrixovershock: yeah, it showed you can select a few to show on the screen. the rest just off in grocery list mode
[2:53:32] Fiamma: Oh they said 5? Cool, I thought I read 4
[2:53:38] NIICKLAS_TV: its pretty okl
[2:53:45] NIICKLAS_TV: ping isnt too bad
[2:53:52] funviking99: would be cool if the theme changes as expansions come along
[2:53:52] S3N71: I play NA as well, have ran dungeons, timewalking, no issues
[2:53:54] lilkenzies: why are they wanting ally and horde as one so badly? why are we not keeping to wow lore and keeping them enemys?
[2:53:54] Hayely: I play on NA and EU, i never notice lag issues unless there is actual server issues
[2:53:55] Pandachoww: dont worry bout lag! its not unmanageable at all
[2:53:56] Zuldak: maybe it is 4 but i thought i heard 5 at some point
[2:53:58] Harai_Ulfsark: i hope they can increase it to 6 or 7
[2:54:01] funviking99: not the same thing forever
[2:54:05] Fiamma: Absolutely, it's like a... favourites list haha
[2:54:08] MediumRareOG: Thank God I don't have to farm Soundless any more
[2:54:21] Tashasha: Good to know! Thanks!!
[2:54:28] Matrixovershock: truce was made
[2:54:33] Pandachoww: i usually sit at around 105ish but sometimes it goes up to 200 or so....a little higher when i play with oce people but its absolutely workable with
[2:54:35] IAmScarlett__: @lilkenzies be so fr, the current lore is that theres no conflicts
[2:54:38] ShineyFighter: i like the happy hugs time.
[2:54:45] Zuldak: part of the reason why they want to make horde and alliance closer is because they had issues in BFA telling the story to one side and not the other which led players to be confused since not everyone plays both
[2:54:46] lilkenzies: lol no truce for me :P
[2:54:50] mmac27: alliance and horde fighting a common enemy
[2:54:52] ShineyFighter: im an alliance in a hord guild.
[2:54:55] amricatt: I'm gonna have all my different warlocks at camp arguing which one is best.
[2:55:02] Matrixovershock: the war is still there in pvp and war mode.
[2:55:03] kaijoe_: Feels much better heading into the endgame of the next 3 expansions
[2:55:08] MediumRareOG: It's more practical. Alliance was dying. Players had chosen to end factions by going Horde. That's really the only reason
[2:55:12] databob1: They can still be seperate groups but it would be cool if it wasn't race locked
[2:55:17] Tidesages: I hope we get one day in the future that the updates World wide are anbnd not with a day difference
[2:55:18] Getcha_Pulll: the trick you used yesterday to escape from the dungeon using followr dungeon is super cool. I started using it, lol

[2:55:18] xwowkillax: SMOrc ALLIANCE SCUM
[2:55:25] Tidesages: and*
[2:55:27] Pandachoww: @Tashasha no problem at all <3
[2:55:40] funviking99: mrgmHelloThere
[2:55:55] lilkenzies: ally scum!
[2:56:06] NIICKLAS_TV: the fact that greymane let the undead help for the gilneas questline was wild (considering how much he hates them)
[2:56:11] Harai_Ulfsark: 110 is better than latam players that doesnt have any other choice but to play on NA KEKW
[2:56:16] Harai_Ulfsark: yes just nuke it
[2:56:22] Pandachoww: the only time i really lag is when i play with OCE and even then its fine 98% of the time
[2:56:29] Kindosar: you can solo
[2:56:43] ShineyFighter: majestic.
[2:56:47] Zuldak: it was cool if you played both sides of the story. Heck, if you didnt have a priest you had no idea Calia was in the game and Xalatath would be some random shadow elf from nowhere
[2:56:48] IAmScarlett__: i hope that mount never drops dan
[2:56:49] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:56:50] ShineyFighter: sporkyGib
[2:57:06] Pandachoww: mate OCE players get lag with OCE players XD
[2:57:41] Necoc: such fun
[2:57:42] MediumRareOG: I did every class hall quest line and didn't read any of them
[2:57:46] Zuldak: Kings rest? No. It was very linear and this long hall was hell on wheels
[2:58:00] lilkenzies: i like that you can make the dino wrapped in bandages hunter pets from kings
[2:58:14] Pandachoww: THIS boss on a 20....on tyran
[2:58:20] xeruin: i got lost in nonlinear dungeons (waycrest manor)
[2:58:28] Pandachoww: horriffic, but i miss it
[2:58:37] Pandachoww: easily
[2:58:45] michaelmm: I think it's the best M+ season yes.
[2:58:45] Rarazaran: dead dino is mid quest pet
[2:58:54] Zuldak: I liked season 3 of SL a lot. Encrypted was fun
[2:58:55] xeruin: i love it for reins of the quantum charger
[2:58:58] Kindosar: timers are hella forgiving
[2:58:58] CapitaineMarcellus: best season was season 4 of shadowland
[2:59:02] ccatalysttt: it's easy
[2:59:06] michaelmm: The dungeon pool is good and the difficutly curve is well tuned. Ultra PUG firendly.
[2:59:08] Pandachoww: dungeon pools awesome, classes feel great, nothings TOO overtuned
[2:59:11] NeeK_23: I preferred last season, non of the dungeons are ones I like. S2 was better imo. but it does seem easier
[2:59:20] ccatalysttt: Not a lot of coordination for pulls and stuff like SL had honestly
[2:59:32] MediumRareOG: Wasn't S4 of SL the first to add old dungeons to the M+ rotation?
[2:59:34] Zuldak: yeah 1000% DF is much more pug friendly.
[2:59:43] Pandachoww: On TwItTeR
[2:59:44] GinkoTheSilverfox: GG!
[2:59:47] michaelmm: Shhhh - if we say a class is "good" nerfs quickly follow!
[2:59:48] ImperfectDark: at the entrance
[2:59:49] Pandachoww: wowtwt can do one for opinions
[2:59:49] Zuldak: SL was awful for requiring people to know specific mechanics beforehand
[3:00:04] NeeK_23: nice mount
[3:00:13] Necoc: wasn't there a pet in here as well?
[3:00:18] IAmScarlett__: nice mount homie
[3:00:22] GinkoTheSilverfox: This is why I just came on my hunter and tamed the raptor that looks like a mount :)
[3:00:40] Xspectia: a tip for my fellow mount collectors, if you've done kings rest once on mythic. next reset extend the lockout and enter and u will spawn at third boss and u will get loot
[3:00:45] funviking99: mrgmHehe
[3:01:10] Zuldak: hmm the best M+ season... Season 1 of BFA was ghuunies and awful. Season 2 was reaping whch was cool but tol dagor exists... beguiling in S3 BFA was bad...
[3:01:15] xeruin: i used that lockout trick a lot. it works for kings rest
[3:01:18] heggest: no it wont
[3:01:30] Pandachoww: yo reaping was dope asf
[3:01:34] Kindosar: KR is bugged, it works
[3:01:44] MediumRareOG: @Xspectia Do you need to not kill the last boss? I'm totally trying this
[3:01:54] xeruin: sadly it doesn't work for Underrot, but it works for King's Rest
[3:02:00] Elrathir: one dungeon pool for the entire expansion? sounds made up, fake news
[3:02:09] Pandachoww: the absolute stampede of everything youd killed....so good
[3:02:17] Xspectia: @Xspectia no u can kill the last boss
[3:02:31] NeeK_23: yeah all Legion/BFA was the same and 3 seasons of SL
[3:02:32] Xspectia: @Xspectia its a bug that they havent fixed basically
[3:02:33] Eggz1004: sounds like an exploit... might want to be careful with that, dont want to get banned for something trivial
[3:02:34] handovdoom666: how are you going to solo the three totems?
[3:02:49] Mystic_Bard: in DF ? or in SL too ?
[3:02:53] MediumRareOG: I always thought it was a great idea
[3:02:55] IAmScarlett__: they were pissing and shitting about it
[3:03:16] xwowkillax: EZ
[3:03:34] Harai_Ulfsark: my nightmare was soloing that on my warrior
[3:04:02] NeeK_23: afflock, just put corruption on each and afk LUL
[3:04:19] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah i ended up charging + heroic leap, just thought it would be easier LUL
[3:05:10] MediumRareOG: Don't most raids use different appearnces per tier? So 4 different gear sets for Hellfire Citadel?
[3:05:29] Matrixovershock: I just flew through shadowlands in about 3 days haha.
[3:05:35] xeruin: shadowlands dungeons are easy but you still have to do mechanics on certain bosses
[3:05:39] Matrixovershock: but not with ATT haha
[3:05:39] mmac27: when u say 100% are I going for all mounts? how many do u have now?
[3:05:42] michaelmm: Shadowlands dungeons are easily soloable just a little slower.
[3:05:48] xeruin: shoutout to the SL boss that knocks you off the platform if you fail the mechanic
[3:05:50] NeeK_23: BFA having no class sets was sad, glad we have tier back
[3:05:58] MediumRareOG: Throne of Thunder normal/heroic are different
[3:06:13] michaelmm: Soleah takes 20 mins to solo tho due to the mechanics.
[3:06:27] MediumRareOG: oh sorry, i get ya
[3:06:39] BBMezzy: replacement for azerite armor
[3:06:46] Eggz1004: bfa didnt have regular helms, so they added that as M+ loot
[3:07:01] xeruin: yeah the last boss of the SL megadungeon (who drops a mount) takes so long to solo that imo it's not worth it at this time
[3:07:03] mr_kinky: For old dungeons they add extra armor for BFA and new weps for Legion
[3:07:18] Zuldak: Dirt chicken
[3:07:28] Harai_Ulfsark: is that a unique recolor/mog?
[3:07:51] ollie_oilspanner: Can't wait to appearance farm with Warbands
[3:07:55] MediumRareOG: why do people create world boss groups when the boss isn't up? God this is annoying
[3:07:56] Harai_Ulfsark: damn ill need to spam +2 on my plates
[3:08:13] mmac27: I got that Clayscale Hornstrider on my first dig bmkBmk
[3:08:31] Zuldak: theyve been adding some season exclusive mogs. There is a 1h mace from darkheart thicket called the corrupted knot and i think there is a polearm from Blackrook that is unique to this season only
[3:08:35] Nilzours: !lurk thank you for drops later MrGm
[3:08:41] Harai_Ulfsark: VIBE
[3:08:43] mr_kinky: Quest Mog Farm > D&R Mog Farm atm x)
[3:08:44] Zucchey: I am losing something, my sanity
[3:08:48] ollie_oilspanner: Have they said if warbands will work retroactively for appearances?
[3:08:56] Tidesages: why do you do this one again?
[3:09:20] Harai_Ulfsark: hoard all the things
[3:09:26] ollie_oilspanner: got it, thanks
[3:09:41] NeeK_23: imagine how busy item restoration is going to be once launched
[3:09:42] Zuldak: everyone starts rolling need on gear now
[3:09:43] Harai_Ulfsark: if you got that mannoroth tusks on your mage, keep it yeah
[3:09:55] Fiamma: I'd imagine people would get pretty upset if they said it would, then it didn't quite work on release too
[3:10:07] zanriah: so if i get tusks ona cloth wearer should keep that around gotcha
[3:10:37] xHukk: Why you moving so fast?  It seems passive?
[3:10:39] funviking99: I have a feeling it won’t and ppl will be mad LUL
[3:10:41] Eggz1004: like Tusks of Mannoroth
[3:10:49] Pandachoww: oh mate ive had so much takeout this month its absurd, i need to cut down XD

[3:12:11] Gimchy: any prime gaming drop incoming??
[3:12:27] TheHunter90: do you also farm one hand sowrds,axe and daggers?
[3:12:35] Sukodin: Do you have to equip an item to get the tmog for it?  or can you just sell it?
[3:12:43] ren_tex: when does the next prime coming tho ?
[3:13:00] Kindosar: bad @Lausten

[3:14:20] indecisivewisp: Everybody would rec their local chipper KEKW
[3:14:26] TheHunter90: do you also farm one hand swords, exes and daggers?
[3:14:35] JakeSezz: On the coast, aye 🫡 Makes sense cuz the best seafood in the U.S. is on the coast

[3:14:51] JakeSezz: And local spots work! I’d actually prefer a local spot
[3:15:11] NeeK_23: but everywhere in the UK is no more than 70miles from the coast
[3:15:16] GinkoTheSilverfox: If I ever get to the UK I just want to try some bean on a toast
[3:15:18] handovdoom666: poke your head in, if it looks like all locals, you went to the right place
[3:15:19] ollie_oilspanner: ollie_oilspanner subscribed with Prime.

[3:16:00] KrathiumWoW: why would you eat food at spoons??
[3:16:03] MediumRareOG: I don't think we have baked beans in the US supermarkets
[3:16:13] Pandachoww: please tell me you mix cheese in with the beans
[3:16:23] NeeK_23: spoons does anything. I've seen drunk people order each other a shot of peas and Spoons served it

[3:18:34] Erinalle: I love it becasue I do not have to talk anyone to order things that I cannot pronounce LUL
[3:18:38] NeeK_23: baked beans are haricot beans in tomato sauce

[3:24:39] BBMezzy: Maybe if you add a pirate flag to the archives they'll get a response :p
[3:24:47] Zuldak: Ybarra said no pirates. What he meant was 'No, Pirates!'
[3:25:09] MachoCham: People forget the context of "No Pirates" was in context of the next expansion
[3:25:10] JakeSezz: @fathomlordcrunch hahahahaha that would be the best WoW troll-job ever mrgmHehe mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[3:25:25] NeeK_23: they always said no pirates in 11.0. They never said no pirates in DF
[3:25:29] funviking99: dragonriding in old world is so good
[3:25:36] MachoCham: Like they said no 3rd spec in 10.0
[3:25:40] Tashasha: weeeeee
[3:25:54] runetotemgabs: yes there is a mount
[3:26:08] Pandachoww: i still dont know what augvokers even do
[3:26:09] NeeK_23: @Elkhuntsman yeah low drop but you can farm it
[3:26:17] Zuldak: i so hope dracthyr can be other classes. Such a shame to keep them locked as lizard wizards
[3:26:43] NeeK_23: @Pandachoww make you and party better.
[3:26:43] runetotemgabs: its wizard time
[3:26:56] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah bc their transmog sucks
[3:26:59] funviking99: yeah , too late
[3:27:04] KrathiumWoW: Dracthyr other classes wont happen.
[3:27:09] damien_: Earthen Dwarves ResidentSleeper
[3:27:16] MediumRareOG: I don't think anyone really likes dracthyr, that's why
[3:27:19] funviking99: they said it would
[3:27:19] Zuldak: I mean, I play druid so mog being hidden is normal
[3:27:25] yakisy: I wonder when dk gets new pet costumzation
[3:27:28] magemaster225: the rigging team probably too busy fixing mount rigs than dracthyr rigs for class animations
[3:27:30] Harai_Ulfsark: its more likely than evokers for other races
[3:27:36] NeeK_23: @MediumRareOG I mean I main evoker sooooo
[3:27:39] KrathiumWoW: They have racials tied into talents.
[3:27:49] funviking99: in the last titan , we go back to northrend
[3:27:59] funviking99: dk will get more stuff then
[3:28:05] D4v1d7w17ch: I think it will happen eventually, they could tie it into the lore nicely by maybe sending Dracthyr to the order halls to train.
[3:28:06] Niixten: war within alpha in 2 months
[3:28:08] Oswaldovzki: Hello MrGM! How you doing?
[3:28:09] Medjuza: @Harai_Ulfsark so u want humans to make an empoered deep breath
[3:28:11] Harai_Ulfsark: @KrathiumWoW yeah the other dracthyr classes wont talent into them, they'll get the basic racials
[3:28:13] Medjuza: empowered
[3:28:30] KrathiumWoW: And I doubt they would rework the entire class just for that
[3:28:39] thefeldrake: Evoker tank when?
[3:28:46] MachoCham: They'll just make the racial Evoker only
[3:28:46] Harai_Ulfsark: @Medjuza no i dont, but there are more reasons evokers wont be expanded to other races
[3:28:56] Oswaldovzki: Evoker warrior is my dream
[3:29:18] str4ysheep: the racial argument only is relevant for evokers on other races
[3:29:19] Eggz1004: need a ranged spec for DH using bows
[3:29:24] Harai_Ulfsark: @Oswaldovzki druid paladin when
[3:29:24] JakeSezz: I think that people kinda just over Dracthyr, for whatever reason, and can’t be arsed to talk about it anymore
[3:29:25] Zeigler_: Never seen that Zygor addon looks awesome!
[3:29:26] runetotemgabs: undead druid and pala when ? hehe my utopic wish...
[3:29:27] MachoCham: Or just make them generic racial and rework the talent tress
[3:29:49] michaelmm: They are taunting you now!
[3:29:50] MachoCham: !zygor

[3:29:52] KrathiumWoW: Highly likely we are going to get a new class in Midnight anyway
[3:29:54] funviking99: demon hunters will never get a 3rd spec
[3:30:03] Khinjars: They're teasing us so bad
[3:30:22] chelfx: Hottake i dont think we need another class, i rather have more specs
[3:30:25] MachoCham: All of these devs teasing + holly's post about what's in store....
[3:30:28] Harper_n7: What's going on? What am I missing?
[3:30:32] MachoCham: Doesn't help with hopium
[3:30:40] shaypressplay: with all this teasing I hope it is something spectacular and not a let down
[3:30:42] cyniczny_michal: I rather got that cliffhanger with 10.2.6 and skull than whole SL cliffhangers
[3:30:46] JakeSezz: I have the Menari customizations and now need only Battle Mages and my WoW wishlist is complete
[3:30:49] NeeK_23: kinda annoying to hear people complain about evoker, when they havent played it. Its a fun class that alot of people dismissed since they didnt want to be a dragon.
[3:31:09] MachoCham: For what it's worth Neek I enjoyed my Devoker

[3:32:56] sinlesssinner: well gl to you bud
[3:33:29] NeeK_23: we should form a crack team of achievement hunters for anything that needs 2+ people
[3:33:33] chelfx: The good company also helps

[3:34:48] ollie_oilspanner: Zygor is a paid service though
[3:35:14] ollie_oilspanner: Totally worth the price, but just mentioning it in case others didn't know
[3:35:35] ruffian0305: @ollie_oilspanner Absolutely worth every penny
[3:36:00] fennecx25: how many achivement points you have?

[3:36:17] ollie_oilspanner: is free
[3:36:36] fennecx25: sheesh
[3:36:37] Zuldak: over 30k is good
[3:37:11] Zuldak: honestly i do highly recommend the pet battle ones for the dungeon ports in legion dalaran
[3:37:14] NeeK_23: PvP is my weak area, so many points I wont get
[3:37:20] Zeigler_: I have 32k but missing so many pet battles and PVP since never touch them
[3:37:30] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: GM, have you had any weird issues with the trading post as of late? I’ve got an issue with my trader’s tender. At the beginning of the month, it showed that I had -600 trader’s tender. I’m at the point where I’m supposed to have 700 trader’s tender but it only shows that I’ve got 100 left. Is there a way to fix this?
[3:37:39] Zuldak: some of the pvp achieves are super nuts
[3:37:59] NeeK_23: pet battle dungeons are great purely for the free portals all around the old world
[3:38:26] Zeigler_: @NeeK_23 do you know which ones they are?
[3:38:50] Isariby: I was tracking a fishing achievement involving legion quests and it disappeared. I heard it happened with many
[3:39:25] michaelmm: Some achievements have been bugged since the patch dropped.
[3:39:25] NeeK_23: Deadmines, Wailing caverns, strathholme, gnomergan are the ones I can remember, think there's one more
[3:39:29] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: I sent a bug report to Blizzard about the trader’s tender issue but I haven’t heard anything from them.
[3:40:01] NeeK_23: easy/hard depends on your pets. but you can have people loan you pets
[3:40:11] MediumRareOG: legendary fishing pole seems to be a huge time sink
[3:40:25] Fede_Lorca: is there a drop reward active? i didnt knew
[3:40:39] ollie_oilspanner: it's a fun questline for the leggy pole though
[3:40:43] MediumRareOG: like just getting conjuror margross rep is like 8+ hours of fishing
[3:40:55] havoom01: yea already got my toy,thanks Dan
[3:40:56] ollie_oilspanner: yes, but there is an scenario too
[3:40:59] ollie_oilspanner: at least one

[3:41:49] lilkenzies: glad i found you :)
[3:41:52] shaypressplay: I got my drop ok
[3:42:00] NeeK_23: I could loan you the right pets for the pet dungeons sometime and coach you though but it might take a few hours as they can be quite long to complete
[3:42:10] Getcha_Pulll: ATT content is the best!
[3:42:12] padmans_uk: Hey hey :D
[3:42:21] Tashasha: Never got the toy for the Manuscript of Endless Possibility that I purchased on several characters. Guess I have to buy the toy again

[3:54:10] GrizzledGrim: I actually liked most zones in bfa. Fun times
[3:54:12] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: This is kinda weird. Blizzard denied the rumors about pirates. Now there’s pirates to deal with.
[3:54:15] MrsWeedo: You can use a boat in 1000needles
[3:54:15] Harai_Ulfsark: i think not, they learned a lot from vashjir
[3:54:16] Zuldak: Vash'jir has entered the chat
[3:54:17] AndAsh05: 100% they thought iof that
[3:54:19] amricatt: Definitely.
[3:54:21] Kubwa7: vash'jir 2.0
[3:54:30] nyrhalahotep: both cities were gorgeous
[3:54:32] xeruin: i think the negative reaction to vash'jr ruled out any chance of underwater nazjatar
[3:54:52] Necoc: Vash'jir had a great story though
[3:54:53] nyrhalahotep: @xeruin  oh yeah 100%
[3:54:57] taker_1986: id have thought id would have been discussed then people remembered vaj'shir [which i quite liked]
[3:54:59] xeruin: they deliberately tried to make vash'jr player friendly with the sprint underwater quest and the super fast seahorse mount, it wasn't enough
[3:55:08] Kubwa7: i'm sure i'm the extreme minority...but i loved vash'jir...very very unique
[3:55:09] Zuldak: it didnt make any sense why Azshara kept the sea open like that for us... but i did like the zone
[3:55:11] adampanerabread: why is your vigor showing like that at the top of your screen
[3:55:18] chelfx: I liked it but im werid
[3:55:28] Harai_Ulfsark: its bc combat with height added sucks
[3:55:38] Oswaldovzki: cute
[3:55:52] amricatt: I liked Vash'jir too.  The Horde storyline was fantastic.
[3:56:07] xeruin: the lingering vigor thing is an annoying bug, i don't use many addons and it happens to me too
[3:56:09] JakeSezz: all-flying zone? you mean storm peaks? mrgmHehe
[3:56:16] xeruin: it goes away if i mount a dynamic flying mount
[3:56:40] chelfx: 10.2.5 really stating to look like it was made with a Skelton crew
[3:56:53] JakeSezz: Storm Peaks is a Top 3 zone for me
[3:56:58] xeruin: a lot of BfA chests are 1 time only including the one with very unlucky rock
[3:57:16] xeruin: i think there is a type of repeatable BfA chest but most treasures are one shot
[3:57:34] Harai_Ulfsark: you need that rock to buy the shadowlands worm pet
[3:57:38] xeruin: "very unlucky rock" is a grey item that is part of the currency for a shadowlands pet
[3:57:56] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: If you’re at max level and can fly everywhere, how come flying doesn’t work in Shadowlands?
[3:58:49] xeruin: you have to unlock flying for shadowlands and you have to unlock flying again for zerith mortis specifically
[3:59:16] indecisivewisp: Damn that's gross
[3:59:29] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: I’m surprised they haven’t changed it yet
[3:59:45] xeruin: i see a lot of people in SL farming mounts and stuff
[4:00:10] Zuldak: mount wise SL is overwhelming
[4:00:13] Zuldak: like there are a LOT
[4:00:36] xeruin: you have to farm a LOT of anima to buy all the mounts
[4:00:37] indecisivewisp: The amount of tmog shit as well
[4:00:44] taker_1986: never did it
[4:00:54] Zuldak: Temple was great until the final part. Would have been a banger if it ended with the 3rd boss
[4:00:56] indecisivewisp: I like the tmogs from it!
[4:00:59] MediumRareOG: one day i'll go back to do the ember court and the necro crafting but... not today
[4:01:03] chelfx: eyeball boss sucks
[4:01:05] taker_1986: ive got dungeon anxiety and i dont want to mess it up
[4:01:06] NeeK_23: the mob room was annoying
[4:01:08] Zuldak: I hated the eye room and the final boss
[4:01:11] Kubwa7: pull out the ol' spirit beast :P
[4:01:13] nisho1003: Temple was fun when everyone got stuck in the orbs
[4:01:13] NeeK_23: endless spawns
[4:01:15] nisho1003: :)
[4:01:28] Eggz1004: how was embver court changed?
[4:01:30] Eggz1004: ember
[4:01:33] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:01:39] Zuldak: ember court is daily now not weekly
[4:01:44] Harai_Ulfsark: i remember when i was like "cool ember court will become a daily lockout" and then i never did it again
[4:01:46] D4v1d7w17ch: it's daily now yeah
[4:01:48] Kubwa7: yes, ember court is now daily instead o weekly
[4:01:51] KrolexsixTV: Ember court was duuuumb
[4:01:54] MediumRareOG: it might be daily but it's still the ember court so....
[4:02:00] Zuldak: i liked the court. I have everyone at max
[4:02:12] Zuldak: it was a fun thing to do on mondays before reset
[4:02:20] GinkoTheSilverfox: I had my fun with Ember court, probably the most enjoyable covenant weekly for me
[4:02:22] Harai_Ulfsark: i did most things from all covenants to get the veilstrider
[4:02:24] MediumRareOG: i only did the night fae seeds. none of the other covenant busywork
[4:02:25] NeeK_23: it was the most fun of the 4
[4:02:25] amricatt: I never did any of those 'end convenant' thingies
[4:02:30] Kubwa7: yeah, i did everything will all covenants but Bastion one :P  too bright...i need to go finish that one :P
[4:02:31] Zuldak: yes you will have reputations with the guests

[4:02:34] KrolexsixTV: Missing 3 things from ember court
[4:02:46] D4v1d7w17ch: you can actually get the ember court mount from the necrolords abomination factory.
[4:02:56] MediumRareOG: i only ever heard people bitching about the ember court
[4:03:19] D4v1d7w17ch: yeah, only thing to do court for really is for the party herald title.
[4:03:28] MrsWeedo: I loved EC, tea with Theotar
[4:03:34] NeeK_23: Nightfae was boring, Bastion was annoyingly tough, Necro was ok but just a ton of weeklies unlocking more weeklies
[4:03:43] MachoCham: All I remember about Ember court was having to log in pissed after Preachcon to make sure I was working on the expansion meta
[4:03:53] Kubwa7: @MrsWeedo i miss theotar...
[4:04:05] NeeK_23: you can do last boss, it just takes a while
[4:04:21] chelfx: yeah

[4:09:48] Harai_Ulfsark: yo how come they didnt gave us "of Gilneas" title for worgen players doing the questline, and the missing weapon/shield recolor 😡
[4:10:40] ratgefingah: hi mrgm so you think there will be a feat of strength achievement for df like veilstrider? ^^
[4:11:22] KrolexsixTV: if that new rep in recent patch is part of new veilstrider thing imma flip
[4:11:51] Harai_Ulfsark: wowhead /news/class-specific-weapons-shields-and-offhands-on-the-patch-10-1-ptr-331787
[4:12:25] Harai_Ulfsark: most of those ended up in the trading post
[4:12:48] angeloa95: hey hope your having a good day :D
[4:12:51] Harai_Ulfsark: we got the white/blue one, but the white/dark/yellow is still missing
[4:13:21] braxo140: Hello, I found your guide yesterday and it really helped, so I wanted to come say hi, and thanks braxo1HI
[4:13:33] ratgefingah: i know some ppl r gonna go for it too late and miss he Ohn'ahran Trail Achievement
[4:14:23] NeeK_23: is that the moving camp one?
[4:14:33] padmans_uk: You can miss that?
[4:14:43] ratgefingah: I had to put my alarm to 5 am for one of them
[4:14:46] NeeK_23: phew, I got that. The storms one almost killed me though
[4:15:33] ratgefingah: weeklies Pog
[4:15:53] ratgefingah: I think I overslept
[4:15:58] ratgefingah: and hae to still do it

[4:18:02] chelfx: I still think its in march
[4:18:32] chelfx: Jul 14, 2022
[4:18:36] Harai_Ulfsark: im not buying any frogs for 333333 gold
[4:18:36] Khinjars: @Katariatv March probably
[4:18:40] ratgefingah: felt like df came out super quick
[4:19:10] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: That’s a lot of 3’s
[4:19:32] chelfx: If they have similar testing period if it comes out in march the aug/sept release date can make sense
[4:19:56] Harai_Ulfsark: its because people level there by default

[4:20:29] ratgefingah: bfa feels like the odd 1 out when it comes to legacy content
[4:20:30] Harai_Ulfsark: so the dungeons are really weird, where BfA mythics and heroic are lvl 50, and normals are lvl 60 KEKWAIT
[4:20:46] MediumRareOG: BFA scaling changed in pre-patch. BFA became the levelling expansion so some (but not all) of the content scaled to 60
[4:21:10] MediumRareOG: for example, normal dungeons to 60, heroic/mythic to 50, nazjatar/mechagon to 50 not 60
[4:21:19] Chesscape: I agree
[4:21:36] MediumRareOG: I agree. I don't know how well DF will work as a levelling expansion. BFA is fine
[4:21:38] chelfx: i think it has too with giving you dragon flying
[4:21:40] NeeK_23: not for Horde I dont think
[4:21:42] ratgefingah: I started playing in sl and lvld my first toon through alliance bfa , it was so good
[4:21:46] Harai_Ulfsark: i just thought BfA sucked as the default leveling area before they unlocked pathfinder for everyone
[4:21:51] ghuuny: df only works with dragonriding, do you get it with lvl 10?
[4:22:33] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[4:22:39] ratgefingah: exiles reach npc's going with you to the dragon isles and follower dungeons feels like a nice touch
[4:22:46] lilkenzies: i avoid those dragons at all costs
[4:22:46] Harai_Ulfsark: probably why they're also working on the dynamic ground mounts?
[4:23:03] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: I think things are gonna change for Anduin in War Within. He claims to have lost his connection to the Light. There’s a chance he will reconnect after he meets those people who have a very strong bond with the Light underground. They’ll probably show him the way.
[4:23:05] lilkenzies: hate them
[4:23:26] lilkenzies: almost quit dragonflight casue of em
[4:23:41] lilkenzies: ya
[4:23:44] ratgefingah: propably a dk main Kappa
[4:23:46] Scudbomb: Dragon riding feels great
[4:23:49] AndAsh05: Does Anduin change from being a priest to being a warrior, like his father?
[4:23:50] lilkenzies: first day still hate them
[4:24:04] lilkenzies: lol ive finished everythign ever
[4:24:18] phyra: the story is extremely confusing for new players but does DF story make more sense as an intro for new players
[4:24:24] justcl0udd: Is it worth starting to play wow in 2024?
[4:24:36] phyra: I def saw a video where a guy was like??? the launch screen says Dragonflight and i cant figure out how to get into dragonflight??? its BFA?
[4:25:05] amricatt: I'm not a big fan of dragonriding honestly.  I'm sure it's based on my level of suck.  I'm just not good at it.
[4:25:06] chelfx: Does BFA still make sense for starting story if you go right in to TWW
[4:25:10] Saiyarina: lvling up tp lvl 60 first...
[4:25:17] phyra: ya silly new guy
[4:25:19] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[4:25:58] NeeK_23: it 100% does. its the setup for Iridikron
[4:26:08] NateOliveiras: Id say BFA's story connects almost seamlessly with TWW
[4:26:11] Harai_Ulfsark: dragonflight is a pretty expansion-agnostic story, specially in leveling content
[4:26:15] NeeK_23: DF is like the prologue
[4:26:16] michaelmm: The only issue with BfA is the faction conflict which is out of step with the Alliance+Horde currently being at peace. Dragonflight reflects that better.,
[4:26:21] alextheblight: I don't like the fact that there isn't a Dragonrider title
[4:26:50] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:26:51] NeeK_23: I mean thats a system failure. and does need fixing so that those key points are covered in leveling
[4:26:51] alextheblight: thought there was going to be one for the Challenge race gold achievement, but apparently not
[4:27:01] Arlaeya: The Aspects just got a powerboost to defend Azeroth BY Azeroth... and I'm guessing the Black Flight should be picking up weird voidy goings on below...any day now.
[4:27:12] phyra: maybe they can have a prepatch bridge the story for new players too
[4:27:30] MediumRareOG: People said the same thing when BFA started at level 10 about the stakes btw
[4:27:55] michaelmm: With the datamined signs they may be trying open world timewalking for Pandria to retall it's story. Maybe that's something they will try for Dragonflight levelling?
[4:28:04] lilkenzies: it was difficult when it launched as the trash piles were glitched but jana trash achievement isnt really difficult now i dotn think
[4:28:44] alextheblight: sus
[4:28:54] Erinalle: "artist"
[4:28:55] michaelmm: They we we just drop a expansion story midway through because we reached a certain level's always made the levelling stories hard to follow.
[4:28:56] BBMezzy: Those get blocked immediately
[4:29:02] Nativ_TV: Indeed, everytime, I just joined the stream, no idea what you are talking about tho
[4:29:20] alextheblight: gotten a few follows from 'artists' on twitter. They're bots?
[4:29:57] Nativ_TV: Nice new twitch drop, now we can all be gothic edgelords
[4:30:25] Shocklate_: MrGM Starforge sponsor when? Pog
[4:30:41] ratgefingah: ur going so fast
[4:31:15] Arlaeya: Yeah, the story has to be optional with points to bail and return if they want
[4:31:16] chelfx: or just make a curated story patch that will get you 10-60
[4:31:20] alextheblight: that'd be bad
[4:31:21] chelfx: path**
[4:31:33] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:31:34] NeeK_23: dynamic leveling exp so that you hit 70 at the end of the story
[4:31:55] PiTylol: solo leveling should be just as fast as dungeon spamming
[4:32:01] michaelmm: Rested XP also makes it really hard to manage levelling speed for the devs.
[4:32:05] PiTylol: and the issue is the latter is so much faster
[4:32:13] nisho1003: disable dungeon spamming
[4:32:15] nisho1003: ez fix
[4:32:16] Nativ_TV: I dont think its that bad, other games make you do all the story of all the expansions just to get to the end, like FFXIV, and you dont see people complain
[4:32:16] NeeK_23: for alts then you can do whatever, this is just new players
[4:32:26] PiTylol: @nisho1003 wrong direction. go back
[4:32:32] havoom01: i want pps to be forced to do maw without mounting before going into war within
[4:32:58] NeeK_23: wow players hate all change, even ones which benefit them
[4:33:25] Nativ_TV: I just joined and you leave already? :(
[4:33:26] chelfx: what we having for dinner
[4:33:28] Bambiprsi: theyre rare and linked into some horde side wq
