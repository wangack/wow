[3:31:23] Lulaboo: The author of the harry potter series doesnt think trans ladies are real ladies and alot of people hate her for it. Streamers who support trans people have been saying that they will not play, be friends with, or associate with anyone playing the game
[3:31:36] KitamaruTV: @Towelliee the drama stems from JK Rowlings anti-trans beliefs. There's a big fight over people wanting to play the game versus people boycotting it over those beliefs.
