[5:06:07] gimmers18: best way to be
[5:07:02] gimmers18: i find myself going between the two games. when i clear HC raid (and burn out on keys) i opt for GW2
[5:09:05] Tritophs: can you already pull the 2 mobs after Tyr on to the boss? And skip the 3 mobs down the stairs just before the boss?

[5:14:34] zooloxthephoenix: tho i think its fun that echo is running with a healer and is still topping the time ^^
[5:15:08] hereforpet: I think part of the disparity between your GW2 and WoW streams is the content. While you did tackle all the endgame content in GW2, there was also content for horizontal/casual players as well. The times I've tuned in for WoW content, it's primarily been high level Instanced content pushes.
[5:15:29] MightyTeaBot: Subscribe to the stream to become an epic gamer! PogChamp bit.ly/tpotSub
[5:15:31] zooloxthephoenix: yh and it replaces the evoker, so the dmg differential isnt that big

[5:22:20] reconquerr: maybe anet is afraid of the possible toxicity it would bring to the game?
[5:22:47] MissKisyana: the content in gw2 kinda degraded to gold per hour to buy shit on gemstore
[5:23:39] neuronutz: competition is linked with evolution
[5:23:43] natesumo: As the face of the game, Do you feel forced into continuing on with gw2 to make a living?
[5:24:20] reconquerr: people thought you quit for a while lol
[5:24:25] reconquerr: on gw2 content
[5:24:51] reconquerr: some were saying it was a perma quit
[5:24:56] hereforpet: Not enough self motivation, and wow is better at providing a carrot on the stick. You were talking to Roy about how high level GW2 pvp'ers wouldn't come up with crazy builds if there wasn't a reward in it for them apart from the pure desire to create those builds. That's why I personally believe that while vertical progression isn't ideal- but it does provide an environment that breeds competition and creativity.
[5:25:55] limeoflight: Yeah gw2 is a good game to log in every couple of months and run a few raids, but it sucks as a progression and streaming game
[5:26:18] MissKisyana: dungeons? abandon! drm? abandon! raids? no new wing for years, effectively abandon! The content is all over the place, mostly ditched after some time by devs.
[5:26:38] limeoflight: @MissKisyana but you get a challenge mode strike once every year if you're lucky
[5:26:48] limeoflight: dont you wanna run the same strike 300 times? FeelsOkayMan

[5:27:57] MissKisyana: @limeoflight on a class that can get overnerfed for few patches with no fix, looking at you deadeye KEKW
[5:28:00] giantblobber: True end game of gw2 is pvp yep
[5:28:13] reconquerr: true end game  of gw2 is jumping puzzles
[5:28:17] hereforpet: I'd say MOBA's version of vertical progression would be the ranking system. You're avatar isn't getting stronger but your status is. Maybe it's not the same but I find similarities.
[5:29:02] wulfgang71: 1.5k rifts
[5:29:10] Tritophs: I've been really interested in getting into wow, but I have to admit that it's quite scary to move into and start over in another game after having 4k hrs in gw2. Basically having to start over and learn everything from scratch
[5:29:41] Glebk0: it’s not that bad tbh
[5:29:43] W34f: @Tritophs wow is very simple at the base level but has a high ceiling
[5:29:46] niko_is_bad: Learning the game is the fun part
[5:30:00] maplelost: @Tritophs pansy. Experiencing and exploring a new game is the most enjoyable part of the game
[5:30:06] Glebk0: yea i like learning the game
[5:30:11] limeoflight: @Tritophs mmo skills transfer over, just gotta adapt to new system/currencies etc
[5:30:42] belfastcl: a lot of people go from wow to other mmorpgs, no reason you can go to wow in the same way
[5:30:51] Rawdec: SOD or retail @teapot?
[5:31:28] neuronutz: let's go team!
[5:31:51] hereforpet: That's why HoT was the most impressionable expansion I've experienced in any MMO. It went from super casual open world to mobs can now one shot you, it forced you to learn how to dodge and avoid mechanics.
[5:32:18] maplelost: it also killed the casual playerbase
[5:32:30] Tritophs: it's not even the game itself, but more so having a community that I play with in gw2 every week and needing to find that again in another game seems difficult
[5:33:28] hereforpet: I don't think so, it leveled up the casual base. I'd venture to say HoT meta's are still the most populated to this day.
