[7:52:29] aekovfromwarcraft: @vendralos ya we always had hopes but Activision bought them

[7:53:15] aekovfromwarcraft: they fired him
[7:53:21] aekovfromwarcraft: worst decision ever
[7:53:25] SSD511_: Smoked
[7:53:28] KodiakJedi: Cause you can try other specs without worrying about losing rating
[7:53:33] Vendralos: @KodiakJedi I think Dragonflight looks great. I'm talking about people saying that the game will just die if they don't put out another good expansion by their standards
[7:53:47] itswilly_g: litte retail whaaat
[7:54:12] aekovfromwarcraft: I think DF is ok and hope it succeeds but I still think the meta of Warcraft is 30 year old plus dudes
[7:54:14] KodiakJedi: @Vendralos Yeah...people been saying WoW is dead because of X game for 10 years now. Still the most popular MMO.
[7:54:17] aekovfromwarcraft: not new players
[7:54:59] aekovfromwarcraft: yeah it's a refreshed old mmo no one has been able to conquer it

[7:57:03] itswilly_g: doesnt make much sense to me
[7:57:03] Nuvak1711: Wrath is never going to die what are you talking about? It's the best xpac out there
[7:57:10] KodiakJedi: While I think DF is going to be good...I think it's the next expansion that has the chance to be that much better...cause DF is putting all the systems in place...going forward they can just focus on adding content.
[7:57:24] aekovfromwarcraft: StarCraft might be the greatest game ever made but no one makes RTS anymore
[7:57:31] KodiakJedi: That's a super early divine shield
[7:57:32] Vendralos: @frowilson Nah, I think there's a good number of people playing Wrath right now that wouldn't even play Retail. Some of them are also just playing Wrath while they wait for DF
[7:57:39] aekovfromwarcraft: I'd play RTS completive over mmorlg
