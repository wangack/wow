[2:35:28] Titannborn: I’m not gonna lie Wildstar was innovative. It was cool it just fell off because the combat was just a little too hard.
[2:35:40] Titannborn: but the boss raids were awesome. The rooms were next level generation
[2:35:41] falldrgn: wild star was amazing @smokingcactus  great MMO,  just bad managment
[2:35:41] Sollice: @Towelliee Checki Discord when you have a quick second

[5:12:08] Lostdogal: Didn't people say Wildstar failed because of the difficulty in raids etc? Would that still hold true today or was it just difficult for the time do you think?
[5:13:13] Sollice: @Lostdogal I dont know if it was the difficult of raids per se. It was the difficult of GETTING in to raids. They hard gated raid keys etc
[5:13:38] Sollice: Attunements were kind of dumb when they did them and had already been removed from WoW. Carbine should have known better

[5:14:28] warriorzen: @Lostdogal I think it was how they marketed the game as hardcore for hardcore players and not enough end game. Just didn't have enough time to be live for further development. Corporate greed is what it comes down to in my opinion.
