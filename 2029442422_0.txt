[1:56:39] slavjuan: @moeron60 I can imagine, however this just looks really chill
[1:56:45] SumiNoob: It's because our computers are very strong, we don't freak out over the big things. Plus classic is a nice slower placed gameplay I think
[1:56:51] JohnTheTurtleMa: I wish i could
[1:56:53] SumiNoob: PVP is heart rushing KEKHeim
[1:57:18] IGotCarried: is tommy staying healer or going shadow eventually ?
