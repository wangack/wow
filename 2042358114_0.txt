[2:04:36] Kruber_twitch: No
[2:04:39] Kruber_twitch: You have to make the group
[2:04:47] Kruber_twitch: Because it's ID based
[2:04:57] aaronblack21: 2 mages can stack Scorch Living flame and before P2 just evasion
[2:05:02] aaronblack21: damage should be good
[2:05:35] Kruber_twitch: around 100-150

[2:14:35] aaronblack21: It takes me 3 days of 5hr average to get exalted. Good thing i did Ashenvale events for 1k rep, and i dont need 21k, but around 15k for each
[2:14:50] dinoramke: lol actually playing against you :D
[2:15:18] zapadaap: \

[2:15:40] SebSea: Do you have buttons on the side of ur mouse?
[2:16:00] deathvolt96: you can be a sexy undead
[2:16:06] atsusaki: Anyone remember those old razer mouses with like 15 buttons for wow?
[2:17:15] johnsnus00: @atsusaki haha yes!!
[2:17:39] StraightTuna: yes tommykSAD
[2:19:12] deathvolt96: FOR THE HORDE
[2:19:37] vacerss: isnt it 24k?
[2:19:45] MaxiigOne: You get 38 for each flag as well, so 38x3 for each win
[2:19:50] Kruber_twitch: Nah 21k
[2:20:00] MaxiigOne: 38 only as human
[2:20:03] vacerss: oh yeah its 21k

[2:20:32] Bence9811: yes
[2:20:37] Bence9811: racial
[2:20:37] atsusaki: Oldschool
[2:20:39] Bence9811: even in retail
[2:21:25] aaronblack21: U can just have around 5-6 wins a day and u will get exalted before raid 100%
[2:22:20] deathvolt96: those items might not b viable thought gnomeregan raid might have better items than those, or atleast similar power
[2:22:24] Bence9811: next season is stv no?
[2:22:24] vacerss: but everyone will be doing stv
[2:22:30] vacerss: no one will be in ashen
[2:22:51] aaronblack21: @deathvolt96 No, i dont think so as theres no reason for devs to downgrade rep grind in PvP
[2:22:53] mrfgbla: @TommyKayLIVE will u play manor lords? Its coming out in april
[2:23:09] aaronblack21: @vacerss alts will do for easy rep
[2:23:52] vacerss: 52/43
[2:24:06] deathvolt96: 52%
[2:24:23] aaronblack21: U can use NWB addon to show % right on your screen
[2:25:13] siewcasmiercii: PauseChamp
[2:25:46] aaronblack21: its sad
[2:25:50] siewcasmiercii: another day, another win for boomers EZ
[2:26:49] vacerss: living flame was my first server
[2:27:00] SebSea: having alts would ruin the immersion
[2:27:03] SebSea: for me at least
[2:27:13] SebSea: not that mmos have much immersion LUL
[2:27:32] aaronblack21: I never played WoW, SoD for me gives chance to play and try other characters which i wouldnt try on standtart server
[2:27:39] vacerss: this server is kinda my alt
[2:27:44] aaronblack21: So thats why i have alts
[2:27:50] allyofjustice: sod is perfect for alts tho
[2:28:38] allyofjustice: let's change that John
[2:28:59] SebSea: did magic streams perform better than wow?
[2:29:55] Tomek8K: i have my main char but i sometimes like to test out few other roles just for fun, but still full focus on the main char
[2:30:04] hcmraven: WoW is more enjoyable
[2:30:06] aaronblack21: u got 39 per flag
[2:30:10] allyofjustice: healing in pvp is so fun. I want to make a priest now
[2:30:20] vacerss: ashenvale only gives rep till revered
[2:30:24] vacerss: and you are 1k away
[2:30:39] vacerss: honor doesnt matter now
[2:33:33] vacerss: i dont think theyll change old raidds
[2:33:49] deathvolt96: in phase 1 i discovered stuff i never knew before after lvling 10+ characters
[2:35:07] aaronblack21: U dont need FP if u will grind level in dungeons(in the beginning)
[2:35:17] vacerss: you can get a addon "ranker" that tells how many honor you need for next rank @TommyKayLIVE
[2:35:28] aaronblack21: Only one u'll need is probably Western Plaguelands to go to SM
[2:36:14] didgeridoo_____: didgeridoo_____ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! just subbing by, have a great night btw when mega campaign?
[2:38:10] deathvolt96: i dont understand why everyone is pre-planing so much for phase 2. chances are that week 1 raid will be closed
[2:38:51] vacerss: @deathvolt96 yeah but faster you get lvl 40 so you bis faster
[2:39:26] shaurma_man_3d: Hello, anybody here?
[2:39:51] vacerss: you should just focus on getting lvl 26 for next spell ranks
[2:40:00] vacerss: so lvling is better
[2:40:01] deathvolt96: i mean the 20q and 20 tokens is  easyish to do
[2:40:13] deagle535: damn promoting selfhurting by that sub goal KEKW
[2:40:28] gabbarmato: can we watch oversimplified?
[2:40:32] deathvolt96: there are people that are already making premade graveyard dungion groups  for day 1 XD
[2:40:40] kepcast: what are you feeling for the next ck2 game?
[2:40:43] slpjustin: Kappa
[2:40:46] Gammeldamm: what about the flypath stream?
[2:40:48] vacerss: yes
[2:41:11] aaronblack21: SM dungeon grind for Alliance gonna be horrible
[2:41:24] aaronblack21: We have no vendors close to us(
[2:41:36] vacerss: i plan to potentially do all nighter even
[2:41:46] deathvolt96: 29 lvl playes with bfd gear can do graveyard easy
[2:41:48] vacerss: @aaronblack21 south shore
[2:41:52] The_Yazoo: Tommy what was the name of your chapter again?

[2:42:07] The_Yazoo: ok
[2:42:14] deathvolt96: people are already running graveyard at lvl 25
[2:42:32] vacerss: there was 10man raid that cleared library
[2:42:41] atsusaki: Tbh I don't remember anything from today's Italy game KEKW
[2:42:43] aaronblack21: @vacerss Too far, theres Argent down vendor between Tirisfal and WPL
[2:42:47] The_Yazoo: I'm looking forward to Season 2
[2:43:16] vacerss: @aaronblack21 i mean you hs to south shore , then can fly to argent dawn
[2:43:16] The_Yazoo: Just not enough content yet, I'm not a fan of the WSG farming
[2:43:28] aaronblack21: @vacerss Fly? Theres FP there?
[2:43:30] The_Yazoo: 100%, I love classic raids
[2:43:41] vacerss: @aaronblack21 ally argent dawn has yes
[2:43:56] deathvolt96: all depends on new runes
[2:44:07] deathvolt96: for talent picks
[2:44:10] vacerss: they said gnomer will be easy
[2:44:19] The_Yazoo: Yup, thats what I'm waiting for, SoD just needs more content before I dive in
[2:44:24] vacerss: lead dev
[2:44:31] aaronblack21: @vacerss Not one inside WPL, one in Border with Tirisfal and WPL)
[2:45:04] vacerss: @vacerss south entrance on wpl
[2:45:13] atsusaki: So this is PvP? Or PvE
[2:45:31] viktor_mehl: what does the 1 monster subgoal mean?
[2:45:52] deathvolt96: @atsusaki pvp
[2:45:57] aaronblack21: @vacerss Yes,theres one too. I hope they at least add graveyard close to SM for Ally
[2:45:58] Gammeldamm: there will be a Level-40-Raid - Gnomeregan in phase 2
[2:46:08] viktor_mehl: dont subject yourself to that shit
[2:46:16] deathvolt96: i think the plan pre 60 is for raids to be gear farms
[2:46:41] vacerss: they said well coordinated group will clear it easy, bad people will struggle
[2:46:57] aaronblack21: @vacerss well, same as bfd)
[2:47:04] vacerss: yeah same as bfd

[3:05:40] sahwest: what about mana and intellect enchants?
[3:05:46] deathvolt96: wildgrowth is mostly aliance populated, a bit empty on horde side
[3:05:51] vacerss: cuz living flame is locked, so people now are only running alts or waiting for next pahse
[3:05:56] antonio1284_: ah its World of Warcraft
[3:06:01] makarowka322: @vacerss Yeah, that's true

[3:10:45] Kruber_twitch: Yea, more mana cost to push the cast time.
[3:10:47] The_Yazoo: and use derank spells to save more mana
[3:10:58] scottish1900: I don't, I wanted revered for the easy 30 dps sword levelling, but exalted is a hard pass
[3:11:09] vacerss: also derank spells
[3:11:14] The_Yazoo: ^
[3:11:21] lacatoni1234: tommy are you good today my king tommy

[3:11:56] lacatoni1234: tommy are you good today my king tommy
[3:11:58] The_Yazoo: its not 100% needed, but its meta
[3:12:00] vacerss: derank also means more keybinds
[3:12:06] scottish1900: You que slow efficient heals that are downranked, and cancel them if no healing is needed
[3:12:40] scottish1900: vacerss You can bind the same button using shift mods for macros, as in you can hold shift to cast rank 1 heal, and not hold shift to cast a rank 5 heal
[3:13:31] Kruber_twitch: remember cloak
[3:13:31] scottish1900: Shammy healing was very easy, you just shot out banana beams and it did the healing for you LUL
[3:13:43] lacatoni1234: how is your day today my king tommy
[3:13:44] scottish1900: That's pretty much my only experience with healing as well, I healed AQ40 with shammy which was hell

[3:17:15] scottish1900: They are designed to be too complex for a person not trained to read them
[3:17:19] terrantank: @TommyKayLIVE did they pay intererst on the 80k?
[3:17:42] monki_420: getting interest is normal

[3:18:45] terrantank: i member
[3:18:46] scottish1900: 107$, they almost forced us out of our home for 107$. Like they sent us mail saying "Hey we are going to put your house up for auction in two weeks"
[3:18:58] scottish1900: And that's the only warning we got, the other mail that was warning us about it was sent to our previous fucking house
[3:19:31] hcmraven: Yeah, i studied those kind forms and still have no clue, what half of them mean, its bunch of loops and holes for USA
[3:19:51] lacatoni1234: vote tommy for president
[3:20:18] nest0rr_: deserve might be a stron word
[3:20:21] terrantank: @scottish1900 jesus f christ I saw the last week tonight episode where HoA could evict people because of shenanigans but I thought at least banks would be regulated enough in the us
[3:20:32] MaxWeeman: I also do everything in shitty clothing, so when i wanted to deposide 20k cash at the bank they got super suppicion KEKL
[3:20:39] scottish1900: KEKW Banks are the least regulated part, but that was the IRS not the banks
[3:21:10] The_Yazoo: It asked me things about my life I didn't even know, I had to google so much to find out
[3:21:15] lacatoni1234: AMERICA FUCK YHEEE

[3:28:14] 90Veks: wait, so you earn 20k euros per month and you canceled netflix sub so you can save?
[3:28:20] terrantank: @atsusaki depends if you file taxes yourself or leave it to a tax attroney and on your employment status

[3:34:09] nicholas997: I keep track of how much tax I expect to owe, and just keep that in a high-interest bank account
[3:34:43] ShogunStreams: tommy is an alliance andy? i am surprised
[3:34:48] SumiNoob: Depends on how confident you feel with investing, and how much anxiety eats you up with having debt. Even though the reality is debt is manageable if you have a brain.
[3:34:54] nestor2710: Say something in german lol
[3:34:55] Gaxx94: but in that case financially speaking you should get the longest loan and invest the rest in the market
[3:34:56] mojodaddy1: if your mortgage interest rate is lower than current ETF interest rates, then always invest it
[3:34:58] Shekel____: sounds like explaining EU4 loaning meta @TommyKayLIVE
[3:35:05] terrantank: 1.6k isnt even that bad, you'd pay that in rent for an apartment like that anyway right? @TommyKayLIVE
[3:35:05] The_Yazoo: 10% on the remaining amount once pre year interest free, me and my GF are doing that, rushing to get it down

[3:37:29] atsusaki: Nah people in Tokyo are miserable. Osaka is where it's at
[3:37:29] kepcast: isnâ€™t that worth protesting for?
[3:37:31] jakeyytv: did commies fuck up east germany by any chance
[3:37:36] hcmraven: I could have only bought my apartmen due to inheritance from my grandpa
[3:37:41] terrantank: and then people wonder why young couple dont have kids
[3:37:42] hcmraven: apartment*
[3:37:42] NefariousRoach: Is that in whole germany or only in big cities. It sucks but decentralization is good tho.
[3:37:56] Shekel____: The only reason buying an apartment in my city is realistic is that's it's 10km from Gaza KEKW
