[0:32:46] BlewGamingGroup: anyone on the new season of D3 that can give a boost before i have to head into work in 45 minutes ?
[0:33:02] sacrilege_69: : but what about if you do LFR first for the chance drop and orb increase then Normal and then Heroic?
[0:34:48] sacrilege_69: my point is this...is there x3 legit chance of dropping the legendary if...we go LFR first and then Normal and then HC? cause we do get the orbs i am doing it every week
[0:35:00] edgewalkerbmf: datmodz is
[0:35:03] nytebayne: rhykker was last night

[0:37:45] sacrilege_69: @Aquatic_Sloth ok so its very debatable situation when they say legendary can drop on all difficulties...so what i do is this...i go LFR first and if legendary dont drop i go higher difficulty Normal and then Heroic...each kill on Fyrakk i get greater essence even though it counts as just killing only hc same % i still get the x3 chances of flat drop from the boss right?
[0:37:49] Davinah_00: agree

[1:37:02] nephandis: I think for most fights the uptime is better than the immunity
[1:37:09] nephandis: *dps uptime
[1:37:42] nephandis: immunity might be better while you're figuring out defensives though.

[1:43:18] strike879: that gives 447 gear
[1:44:34] SeanTKE: frost mage is so easy on paper but the freeze mechanics and needing to always use defensives in a smart way makes the skill ceiling pretty high
[1:47:12] 5erif: you were happy playingt  he shadow priest
[1:47:40] SeanTKE: its why you start to see more arcane and fire mages around +18

[3:12:50] deadhead922: Make DB a mouse over and thank me later
[3:12:51] Keiishi: i like tank DH, but i cant do dps
[3:13:16] frobikenobi: Heya lux! Got a question for your weak auras. Tried adding a sound to a cooldown when it's ready (Prim Wave for example) but when I add the trigger, it doesn't do anything. Am I missing something?
[3:13:35] MamzellJ: @Keiishi ahah yeah , very mobile its difficult sometimes!
[3:14:26] biirrd: love play warlock, just feels abit bad to wait for Grimore: felguard before use Tyrant
[3:14:29] frobikenobi: Sorry the condition, not the trigger
[3:14:36] Daemoos6: @frobikenobi You're better off creating a separate WA for that, otherwise you'll just lose it every time Lux updates them
[3:15:04] StreamElements:  Want to buy or fund anything for us to open, craft or build on stream? https://throne.com/luxthos

[3:17:08] frobikenobi: I like having sounds with my big cds. Audio queues help a lot.
[3:17:10] Keiishi: @MamzellJ its not even that its difficult, it feels bad to me having to use a mobility thing to do dps, like a lot of your fury generation comes from using vengerful retreat (the backstep), which would i want to backstep D:
[3:17:14] Keiishi: why*
[3:17:33] smashwow: nah you just crank with 4p and cds
[3:17:36] MamzellJ: @Keiishi yeah, theres a build that you need less movement, I might try it

[3:18:24] smashwow: getting to old for DH spurge
[3:18:42] DBtheAlien: literally no talent that you have to stand still for

[3:21:21] neverbornlucky: lux my hip/back doctor wants me to wear padding around my hip /back at night when I sleep cause of the pain. Be so much easier if they just figured out surgery
[3:21:43] sacrilege_69: i wonder where this love for BM came from in Lizzard team whut happened?
[3:21:49] Eitherbore3: to be fair i'm too lazy to lvl another toon and gear it.
[3:22:03] Eitherbore3: and i don't like how dh plays right now

[3:24:11] deadxarrival: marksman is fun in my opinion
[3:24:28] gnomestomper69: hello luxthos
[3:24:28] Eitherbore3: bm is literally press what flashes.
[3:24:28] Keiishi: we have classes like DH jumping around, we had the Sylvanas fight where she jumps up to shoot, why cant MM hunter be cool like that?
[3:24:31] Aquatic_Sloth: mm tier is so amazing, the damage tho is overshadowed by BM
[3:24:33] sacrilege_69: hahahahaa
