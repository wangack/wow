[0:38:50] dimi9231: ghibli music
[0:38:54] silviel: @ZeplaHQ Howdy? By the way Have you tried Palworld? There are so many bunnies in palworld!

[0:44:04] KirinAsya: so you're okay
[0:44:04] reusalfonso: For free
[0:44:07] kuro_mai: no, it's not a gacha xD
[0:44:07] dimi9231: gamba
[0:44:08] 0xMonad: 20 characters+
[0:44:09] lonewolfelite: It's not gacha though

[0:44:35] KnackAndThoughts: the characters are obtained via gameplay, you can customize your team only outside of a mission, but you can switch freely out of combat in the menu
[0:44:37] kuro_mai: 100% zep will take Ferry first
[0:44:44] KirinAsya: it's a 10-15hr story game
