[4:53:00] FourJhinCookies: His E is amazing for just staying alive and repositioning while doing a little damage. Buys you time between Q's in my experience. Sheen items fucking slap too
[4:53:01] avalon0zero: FirstTimeChatter
[4:53:05] Radingod: Smolder looks like his abilities should really do ap
[4:53:06] ShaiMin_: riot was right, this is a good champ for learning adc because it teaches you that you are gonna get your shit stomped 24/7

[5:58:34] big_yapper: fleet>>pta
[5:58:35] senzubeen: running double mana runes is grief, you only need 1
[5:58:36] jivon98: have you tried grasp yet ?
[5:58:37] ilsugna: try dark harvest
[5:58:40] Shmagoigle: Don't go pta then
[5:58:41] Alucard_KOD: time for tank smolder

[5:59:14] Antidomeitic: I watched someone get a total of like 100 healing from conq in a full game
[5:59:15] Thaydz: go poky caster to compensate for early, arcane comet mb, mana flow and scorch, essence on the other tree
[5:59:16] S3xyNugget_69: Streaming waffling
[5:59:16] BanjoCash: Fleet is just good for safe lane
[5:59:19] foochs: Doran Ring Start** is very important. W is an AP coefficient skill. As I keep emphasizing, w is the key skill in line warfare. Shoot w one shot very carefully. You must purchase the seal after the first return to increase the adaptive ability in the rune to AP. Since it is applied, please make sure to go to the existing AD template after purchasing.
[5:59:22] SubmittedDenied: comet or first strike?

[6:00:26] firefish64: dark harvest sudden impact
[6:00:29] TheSoupKitchenX: Auto attacking on him feels like shit.
[6:00:32] Antidomeitic: i dont think you had 1 fight last game where you woulda hit 6 stacks
[6:00:37] Imagineddy: Lethal would only work if E applied on hits to stack faster right?
[6:00:40] Otsuas: PopNemo

[6:01:29] S3xyNugget_69: @yuor_papa it will always hit bro wuh . DH is at 50% the execute is at like 7%
[6:01:29] Imagineddy: Just run comet for extra poke is probably what it'll come down to
[6:01:32] TheSoupKitchenX: Smolder ult isn't as good as I thought. It's like Nami tidal wave and the center slow is super narrow.
[6:01:34] MeFray: @sneakylol what about w start?
[6:01:37] Dirius: Would first strike so you can take biscuits be troll? @sneakylol

[6:02:01] S3xyNugget_69: does smolder r heal nearby allies
[6:02:02] blazeviii: y havent u tot of dark harvest? it’ll help with dmg
