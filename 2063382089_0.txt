[2:45:24] DjUrsu: hunter was OP in P1 with the wind serpent, now is OP with melee. What next ?
[2:45:28] Greghar1: Only "bad" part about gearing melee hunter is the fact you need 2 of similar type weapons
[2:45:39] Greghar1: If he wants to give lions you cant have lone wolf
[2:46:25] fossland: mhm
[2:46:36] Greghar1: double swords, double axes etc

[2:48:10] athania01: DW spec: Increases the damage done by your offhand weapon by 50%, causes your Raptor Strike to strike with both weapons when you are dual-wielding, and Raptor Strike deals 30% increased damage when you are wielding two weapons of the same type.
[2:48:11] Greghar1: Im using wsg sword and rfd sword
[2:48:12] Seemetankin: if melee hunter is good at 60, then literally every single melee will want the same weapons, rogues, enhance, warriors. it's such a stupid design
[2:48:13] DjUrsu: Increases the damage done by your offhand weapon by 50%, causes your Raptor Strike to strike with both weapons when you are dual-wielding, and Raptor Strike deals 30% increased damage when you are wielding two weapons of the same type.

[7:36:27] quellaxx: Hey @Prefoxfox I see you're having issues with Lady Deathwhisper (heroic). Even though it's not the hardest boss in ICC (especially with the 30% buff) it can still be a tough encounter. My guild managed to kill this boss after 18 weeks of progression (with 30% buff though), so if you need any tips don't hesitate to ask mate :)

Respect the goat Prefox and his undeniable MVP like, killer instincts and speed to overcome whatever obstacles are in his way. Nothing stops the Prefox train, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. He will always be one step ahead and faster than whoever challenges him

[9:58:48] Alkisfadern: So, why is Jonn_nner evil? Blame it on the cursed Twitch emote, blame it on the Deadmines, or blame it on his twisted gnome mind. But one thing's for sure – Jonn_nner is the embodiment of chaos, and his reign of mischief will go down in Twitch history. 🌪️😈🔥 #Jonn_nnerTheEvilGnome

[10:00:00] Alkisfadern: You see, Jonn_nner wasn't always evil. Legend has it that he was once a simple gnome, just like any other. But one fateful day, he stumbled upon a cursed treasure chest deep in the heart of the Deadmines. When he opened it, instead of gold and jewels, he found a cursed Twitch emote – the dreaded "KappaCursed."
