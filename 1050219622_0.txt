[6:07:31] T0xicYandere: @MisterMonstarr Basically your energy reset when you switch between Cat form and Bear form, which alow you to constantly cycle your energy as long as you have mana, Druid PVP plays a lot on that stuff. But right now it doesn't reset, energy stay the same, so you can't do this.

When they see the bald head of an intellectually skilled individual, the average can not hold back. Having hair on your head shall prevent us from encounters with a fair share of blood thirsty vampires.

[8:38:39] TheMalicePhallus: @xinitoro ahh that's cool, I had a friend grind a 99 hp purely from soul wars
[8:38:45] SonsoftheSun: hey guys how do you use drums of war while tanking as a druid? /am I gonna be expected to do this

[8:39:15] Hasie: Paladins want 495 :(
[8:39:19] ruben_ssbm: @apmfiftyyy  i'd gues most people are playing wow while watching
[8:39:19] Snoogansx: 490 for raids
[8:39:19] pioff: 490 or 470 with talents
[8:39:21] Kyraig: is defense cap important or can you tank without defnese cap
[8:39:21] gaminglazytitan: 490
[8:39:24] gaminglazytitan: @Hasie oof
[8:39:29] nightfiree: how much is it for druids?
[8:39:36] Ed_Gope: POGGERS
[8:39:37] nightfiree: i missed him say it
[8:39:39] Its_huntelaar: 495 for raids
[8:39:40] N00FTV: sodaDrunk
[8:39:49] Its_huntelaar: But they get 20 from talents
[8:39:49] BxrChampion: = one shot
[8:39:52] jonny94f: resilience helps too
[8:39:53] NorthernerUwU: which is mandatory
[8:39:54] pioff: Defense cap effectively reduces your damage taken by 25%
[8:39:54] Kyraig: ooo
[8:39:54] not_drew: crush not crit
[8:39:54] pyttoon: U need more agi for bether threat and dodge
[8:39:56] jonny94f: u are def capped with like 30 resi
[8:39:56] SonsoftheSun: @sodapoppin are you using Drums of War?
[8:40:03] Tameimpala2: just dont get crit POGGERS
[8:40:05] Whiskra: it's 540 in wrath, so minus 50 for for the TBC defcap
[8:40:06] Xinitoro: TheMalicePhallus dangg i remember similarly from ppl back in the day doing pest control only for 99 hp etc, that cool tho!
[8:40:07] tramzh: bosses if tey crit is like 15k hits
[8:40:07] 3DSwayze: you can go without defense but you run the chance of getting deleted
[8:40:08] Kingunreal_Thiccthighs: Thought druids can't be crush immune
[8:40:10] tjzlock: no its crit
[8:40:11] TheKyleface: wrong, def is for crit
[8:40:13] DstandsforDracula: crush depends on avoidance
[8:40:15] Phuuje: @sodapoppin you don't even need that because you have resil you can factor in

[8:40:23] Thenitram: @sodapoppin is the set bonus for clefthoof set worth it?
[8:40:24] Theaided: Morning man, did any raids happen??

[8:40:26] xwestonxx: Is askmrrobot still a thing?
[8:40:26] Pulleft: KILL ALLIANCE FOR THE HORDE
[8:40:29] sorenmills: resil anti crits work in pve tho
[8:40:32] pioff: Def = crit, 102.4% avoidance = crush
[8:40:32] jonny94f: SpellLanaBackward pls dont talk when u dont know
[8:40:44] Phuuje: @sodapoppin resil is an INCREDIBLY cheap stat for druid tank - pvp tanking gear for druid in this patch was stupid good.
[8:40:44] TheKyleface: crush getting 102.4 avoidance

[8:42:21] jonny94f: SpellLanaBackward ahh double down change subject to lesser without admitting you're wrong, resilience gives more crit immune, druid already has other ways to get dodge easier and cant parry so defense is actually worse :-)
