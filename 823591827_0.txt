[8:35:54] kittymeowmeoww: yea but it keeps the game fresh
[8:36:00] VonicVS: wtf
[8:36:02] MrCow: damn thats a really good pvp trinket
[8:36:03] VonicVS: yo that's insane
[8:36:27] ItsHevx: wtf thats insane
[8:36:44] SVPV: someone else with the trinket
[8:36:44] silverxbaird: other ppl with trinket
[8:36:45] MrCow: id assume other people with that trinket
[8:37:06] dankNstein_: whats ur question
[8:37:21] supamonkeyball: you know everything is personal loot right
[8:37:37] Xcelerates: dont pve trinkets do reduced damage in pvp? might be wrong though
[8:37:49] lurmurt: personal loot is no /rolling
[8:37:51] BossSkillzz: scope how jake looks
[8:38:10] VonicVS: When another trinket gives you secondaries you are stacking
[8:38:10] sifupls: u keep using it cuz it upgrades more in the future
[8:38:10] SVPV: hopefully never, and they keep pve trinkets out of arena for once
[8:38:13] SVPV: but who knows
[8:38:18] MrCow: uhh if you have your stat weights i could probably do it
[8:38:22] silverxbaird: when the trinket does more than 4% vers dmg increase?
[8:38:23] dankNstein_: ur probably going to always want to use it now since dmg is so high
[8:38:23] BossSkillzz: i mean they have other sets
[8:38:25] supamonkeyball: like the loot just drops to each player, no rolling or DKP, you can only trade loot if its not your best piece
[8:38:31] BossSkillzz: but nice set
[8:38:32] BloodMoni: everyone gets their own individual loot
[8:38:36] Aelanian: just got my BIS legendary on my first ever run of the dungeon LOL
[8:38:50] ItsHevx: i think trinkets do reduced damage in pvp right?
[8:38:53] sifupls: renown 7
[8:38:55] dium: yeah
[8:38:56] VonicVS: yeah next week will be 184 i think
[8:38:56] kohwai: next week
[8:38:57] dankNstein_: there is going to be a conquest version of it
[8:38:57] UHmkk: I thought they said pve gear and pvp gear will be a dif thing this expansion. Pvpers wont have to pve to be top tier.. is this false?
[8:39:00] silverxbaird: based on renown
[8:39:01] dankNstein_: its right next to the honor vendor
[8:39:07] benny_ccp: Next week
[8:39:15] JayCx: u have to get ur renown up
[8:39:17] eltororambo: yo! jnbSubs wusshannin bois
[8:39:19] Chillabreh: @brando0722 i heard that too
[8:39:37] eltororambo: jnbSubs lookin good today bois jnbSubs
[8:39:42] sifupls: renown goes up to 5 rn i think
[8:39:43] tadros_cosmic_cactus: your renown carries over
[8:39:44] whompr1: PepeLaugh oh no no no
[8:39:47] dankNstein_: you will catch up
[8:39:56] dankNstein_: trust
[8:40:01] silverxbaird: i don't know how the catchup works but i saw someone get a renown level from a dungeon boss
[8:40:08] watsupyouguys: 777 viewers, we hit the jackpot then just went up when im typing DansGame
[8:40:08] dankNstein_: dungeons, callings, wq have a chance i think

[8:40:14] silverxbaird: im at renown 6 atm
[8:40:18] BossSkillzz: so whats up next jake?

[8:41:49] dankNstein_: @jakenbakeLIVE basically youre going to use the conquest versions (epic) of the trinkets you have right now in pvp, and the only time youll use something else is if you get a busted burst dps trinket from pve
[8:41:53] rumhyy: w OMEGALUL w
