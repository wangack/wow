[0:49:44] lord_death211: Shroud, each ammo piece is a whole mag, you were seriously weighting yourself down, you will not go through more than 1-2 mags in a fight before you have to retreat. You were also carrying a uniform in your backpack but not actually wearing it, which also weighted you down for no gain.

[1:17:33] okmangeez01: @danielnwosu04 You can play for like an hour or two per day and play solo. It's not too hard to get into it. Make sure to ask for help from people if you don't know/don't understand something.
[1:17:36] xMadJester: @danielnwosu04 not really, you have no individual progress, 'you' never get behind, it's always a team effort

[1:17:58] Retro_Johnny: i love the concept of the map like Planetside 2 .. just shows u the scale of it and its not just a run gun shooter
[1:17:58] BuckyWest: @ymemoo this game is significantly better designed and managed than planetside 2 and still has the large war feel so yes
[1:17:58] okmangeez01: @sownys The achievement is winning the war. To win the war, a faction needs to capture 32 Victory Points. Each hex has one VP and there are dozens of hexes.
[1:17:59] zzSyk: @shroud is there a reason for your cam being there?

[1:38:44] broseidonx_: SHRED and SOM are big time Collie clans
[1:38:46] Sifercifer: summit would say he played this off stream a lot @shroud
[1:39:00] CadeAlexander: Just left him KEKW
[1:39:02] raidraidmon: basically destroying hours of work in some cases
[1:39:05] doofizzz: not anymore
[1:39:11] Sont: flatbeds are expensive before sledges
[1:39:14] crimsx0n: foxhole is a great game, but idk why they did all these sponsored streams so early on in the war when we have like 1/100th of the items and vehicles in the game lol
[1:39:16] mikeduder: Or its fuel for vehicles to bring to front
[1:39:16] Eyeofthehawks: tanks are a long ways off lol
[1:39:18] monstertanks36: Flatbeds are difficult to come by this early in the war
[1:39:19] ludwigdieter21: shroud4Head_SG
[1:39:21] RukuTV: Gotta wait till later for tanks to be fully techd
[1:39:21] ItsMeDurandy: Its kinda early for the real Tanks
[1:39:22] davelit: shroudY
[1:39:27] RukuTV: its still reaally early
[1:39:27] DonMerkuzio: summit played it off stream recorded and replayed the video on stream atleast i got told so
[1:39:29] Fluffyfluffybunbun: long way till you get that researched
[1:39:32] chuckthedrunksailor: Tanks will be on the front literally any time now.
[1:39:35] RockOCE: @shroud Tanks will be about 1 week away until we have the technology
[1:39:36] oleoay: @crimsx0n because they just came out of early access, thats probably why they're doing sponsored streams
[1:39:40] Sont: yep this is early war
[1:39:43] zimbovsky: he also needs a crane to load it back onto his truck
[1:39:44] Eyeofthehawks: Persistent war, they can last up to like 40 days @shroud
[1:39:44] f4ntaonline: HI MIchael.
[1:39:45] Wontato: how long does the game lasts?
[1:39:48] theskyjacker92: how long is a game?
[1:39:50] kalash7it: war could be over 40 days like
[1:39:51] millerzz__TTV: ye
[1:39:52] RukuTV: You tech tree the stuff you want to be able to produce
[1:39:53] bloootwo: only the baby tanks are unlocked
[1:39:55] Stetoskop: 1 month
[1:39:56] thirteenn: @Wontato wars last weeks to months

[1:40:00] wTylur: wTylur subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! i heard shroud merch is in stock, made me hard as a rock, but word on the street is that you’ve got a fat cock
[1:40:02] RockOCE: @shroud you could try the armoured car or tankette which has a machine gun though
[1:40:02] oleoay: wars last two to three weeks normally, sometimes longer
[1:40:03] HOPPLA_Zangya: there are also nukes @shroud
[1:40:03] Jumper3917: A game could be from 3 weeks to a month or two
[1:40:06] ChubbyMikey: which is odd, cause in a real battle, the longer it goes the fewer tanks you have
[1:40:07] belth1of1: the game goes on till they wipe
[1:40:09] DonMerkuzio: you kinda start in ww1 and progress to ww2
[1:40:09] BiGGHydro: wars can last months
[1:40:11] asayuhhh: yeah last war lasted 42 IRL days @shroud
[1:40:12] Depiff: ceezLUL
[1:40:13] ze_baus: @Wontato game lasts till the other faction is able to get enough victory points over the other faction

[1:40:13] crustfhuck: mismatch error
[1:40:14] creativityx: battlebit > this game
[1:40:16] BattlingBean: 5Head
[1:40:19] Coolyou7: it's a big learning curve
[1:40:21] Eyeofthehawks: @ChubbyMikey its "WW1" so tanks dont exist until theyre researched
[1:40:22] Chungazoid: its like getting into tarkov for the first time
[1:40:26] wishmeluckeh: @Wontato It depends the last war lasted about a month in real time
[1:40:30] Chungazoid: having people explain things and play with you helps alot
[1:40:31] Sammycosa: its a war attrition simulator
[1:40:31] JerryB0mb: @creativityx not comparable games
[1:40:31] Jumper3917: eta nukes?
[1:40:31] malaciousmutant: Battle bit and this game are two different genre games
[1:40:36] ChubbyMikey: @Eyeofthehawks neither did that jeep
[1:40:38] RAMBOO1121: what is this game
[1:40:39] okmangeez01: @Wontato 43 days actually.
[1:40:41] agenttwitchtvlive: just assign shroud to point and shoot honestly, let the man do what he does best
[1:40:47] broseidonx_: The forever war
[1:40:48] Wontato: thats crazyy
[1:40:49] Goski11: @crimsx0n its more satisfying when you're in the early war and actually see your faction progress to get that stuff
[1:40:51] RukuTV: KILL ITTTT
[1:40:53] NorthAspect: MonkaW forever war
[1:40:54] Pridit: KEKW
[1:40:55] Eyeofthehawks: @ChubbyMikey right but they had to research it

[1:42:27] StreamElements: Foxhole has officially launched with its 1.0 update! Click the link to learn more: https://load.gg/FoxholeShroud #Ad
[1:42:30] okmangeez01: There are three servers.
[1:42:32] mvrcusenvy: yeh the normal trains are massive
[1:42:32] Eyeofthehawks: You really have to find a group, this game is hard to play solo
[1:42:34] thepunisher7899: GiannisLaugh GiannisLaugh GiannisLaugh GiannisLaugh
[1:42:35] oleoay: @LagIs5exy a few thousand, with about 200 or so in each subserver/hex. each server has dozens of hexes
[1:42:40] crimsx0n: normal train would kill that jeep by ramming it, but the small trains are slower and much smaller
[1:42:42] morphpogo: @LagIs5exy per sever/war about 3-4k people, the map is divided into hexed/regions with 120v120 players each
[1:42:42] asayuhhh: yeah real trains can carry up to 900 crates of supplies
[1:42:44] broseidonx_: It’s just the tiny train. The full locomotive doesn’t get teched for a while
[1:42:54] Eyeofthehawks: You can but you miss so much with the organization of it
[1:42:54] okmangeez01: Shard Baker and Charlie are more noob friendly, but Shard Able is viable for new players as well.
[1:42:55] LagIs5exy: @okmangeez01 that is sick
[1:42:55] tech_six: na i play solo all the time and do logi
[1:42:56] greyanthem: t-talk to people..?
[1:42:57] chuckthedrunksailor: I play solo. I love it. (:
[1:42:58] Fearrrrr1: what in the world is elevate your message
[1:43:02] Eyeofthehawks: So much of the game happens in discords
[1:43:02] valmaininfinte: It is easy with voice chat to find a few people to fight with
[1:43:04] mikeduder: also the biggest tank there is is absolutely massive, its like a house. added this last update
[1:43:06] RockOCE: the community is amazing. you just need a mic and you can get so much done
[1:43:07] monstertanks36: Can play solo if you want. Still plenty fun
[1:43:07] gamingbroTV123: giggity
[1:43:14] oleoay: its easy to find a group if you want to, its easy to play solo if you want to
[1:43:15] brolvl_gaming: @Fearrrrr1 basically pay tons of money so your message stays up for a while
[1:43:15] SavatarVuz: hello sir
[1:43:16] vinushka_dk: the train driver wasnt probably expecting that OMEGALUL
[1:43:17] NorthXNorthWest: Looks like much map reading and only the round whole on the screen is the actual action !!
[1:43:18] synzzo: Every hex/region can consists of 240 people 120 per faction
[1:43:20] broseidonx_: After a war you will pretty much fully understand the game basics.
[1:43:21] K3v1337: there are people who just train new people LUL
[1:43:21] okmangeez01: @LagIs5exy You should know about the time when a Warden (blue team) clan decided to nuke their own teammates in a contested zone instead of firing it at another target.
[1:43:24] G0DSEND357: this game compatible with steam deck?
[1:43:24] WillyLongbeard: lol
[1:43:25] sownys: @tech_six is that still rewarding?
[1:43:25] LubedKitty: I play solo backline shit so fun
[1:43:27] DetusX: Solo at the frontlines is fine just follow the croud YEP
[1:43:29] okmangeez01: It was one of the most epic collapse in all of Foxhole history.
[1:43:33] wishmeluckeh: @Fearrrrr1 Like super chats for YouTube
[1:43:34] tech_six: i pour me a drink and put on Vietnam music from the 60s and run guns all over th emap. its a blast
[1:43:35] KillaKiiKwa: Yooo!
[1:43:36] brolvl_gaming: @G0DSEND357 thats a great questiona ctually

[1:43:56] Fearrrrr1: @brolvl_gaming Yeah okay so its what i thought. Spending $5 to have a massive message of yours on screen for 30s thats wild

[1:44:37] asayuhhh: all of the hexes are different servers
[1:44:41] broseidonx_: @r1ghtv There’s 37 hexes
[1:44:51] tech_six: @sownys very rewarding. Thats how i got my rank up
[1:44:58] asayuhhh: @Girth__Brookz sup girth
[1:45:00] Nishclansniper17: what the bonfires for
[1:45:04] Last_shoT13: why did they chose a hexagon tho
[1:45:05] okmangeez01: War 19 (current war is 96): Wardens nuked Jade Cove, a contested frontline logistics town, because a Warden clan thought it was completely lost. At that point, the Wardens were pushing the Collies (green team) hard and gaining momentum. By nuking Jade Cove, it completely collapsed morale and it would result in one of the fastest collapse in Foxhole history,.
[1:45:10] HooktAwnFonix: just lets you look farther
[1:45:12] Girth__Brookz: @bread_0899  Shroud in the Foxhole hansDERP
[1:45:13] raidraidmon: makes you look over head further
[1:45:14] sownys: @tech_six how do people know to commend you? do you get stats for what you've done and they see it or?
[1:45:14] Vvalsy: @shroud just like aiming but 5x farther
[1:45:15] llama1lad: is this all people driving around or are there front lines/big gun battles? this games seems crazy
[1:45:15] oleoay: binoculars look the same you can just move your camera farther away
[1:45:15] Tankki3: You can just see way farther
[1:45:16] parrytheair: First person POV?

[1:45:30] I_Saw_A_Bear: Not first person but there is a cinematic 3rd person
[1:45:30] oleoay: @llama1lad yeah there's a front line but they're specifically doing backline partisan runs
[1:45:33] ChubbyMikey: @lucasgreey yes
[1:45:34] Brennanx: You can take out their sewage system.

[1:45:41] parrytheair: Bruh what if they nuked Germany back in the day
[1:45:43] HOTDAM: starcraft ghost nuke
[1:45:43] okmangeez01: @llama1lad There are a LOT of crazy front line battles with shells and gunfire everywhere. Summit and Shroud are cutting off logistics right now, which is more like guerilla warfare.

[1:46:08] okmangeez01: I just got off, but I was at a place called Fisherman's Row. Thousands of people were dying by the hour and the entire front was getting pummeled by a combination of armored cars, light tanks, and mortar shells.

[2:06:58] HoGuEE__: is this a game that can be fun playing by yourself or you need friends to play with ???
[2:07:03] pler: Do u hide map
[2:07:05] Donqueror: pocket watching
[2:07:12] oleoay: @HoGuEE__ you can play solo but finding groups is very easy too
[2:07:13] Eyeofthehawks: Top Down Planetside with 2 teams and a game that actually ends

[2:07:34] Citadel1: you can play by yourself and people are happy to group up
[2:07:35] abdastartos: It's a game that plays a lot better with a mic, you can find players in game to team up with
[2:07:36] HoGuEE__: ok thank you all
[2:07:37] Lazioxi: @HoGuEE__ can be both. i did solo for a year and i had fun (but you need to cooperate with others depending on the situation)
[2:07:39] RefiixGaming: friends are included with this game
[2:07:43] tatertot33: What’s the goal
[2:07:44] okmangeez01: @HoGuEE__ You can play solo. I was solo fighting on the front for two hours. But if you want to get into the big stuff (like bigger tanks, base building, etc.), you probably need a group to play with. There are plenty of clans in game that you can join though, and they will help you with resources, manpower, teachers, etc.

[2:29:59] bulldog21kush: Corporal is an E4 which is less than a Sergeant which is E5… Major is an Officer

[2:35:21] calmcontrol: Is it fun? Looks like a very slow game. Like you’d need to spend the whole day playing to start to get into the match.
[2:35:22] papaPathos: @El_R3DBULLQCTTV its one of these games that started ambitious, got humbled by issues but always had a strong following and is now about to shine once more.

[2:36:49] theciscokid2: how does respawning work?
[2:36:54] thecorgies: @calmcontrol a single match can last days. so at the beginning it kinda slow, you need to build up logistics and productions or guns and ammo etc. the frontline will be so chaotic.
[2:37:04] Fandross_: so slow
[2:37:12] Donqueror: shroom
[2:37:14] kynto_vuohi: this looks like a tiktok ad
[2:37:20] Girth__Brookz: @theciscokid2  You just respawn at the base you have your spawn set to, as long as they have "Shirts"

[2:37:25] theciscokid2: ty
[2:37:25] djShineboxx: no tracks in the snow is driving me crazy
[2:37:27] morphpogo: @theciscokid2 you respawn at respawn points your faction holds, each respawn uses up 1 shirt, shirts are produced by logistic players in the backlines and must be distributed to the spawnpoints
[2:37:28] oleoay: @theciscokid2 logistics make things called shirts, each shirt is a respawn. shirts get put at bases that players built and allow players to respawn there
[2:37:29] britcanting: pretty boring

[2:40:28] psyd4mage: what engine was this made on
[2:40:34] ma1kawa11: Unreal 4
[2:40:35] okmangeez01: It’s a war simulator with a player made economy. Everything you see rn, from the RPGs they’re using to the vehicles to the weapons are all player made.
[2:40:45] kkinty: game looks like overwatch
[2:40:47] lootedget: @augustovillela thats because they're playing partisan, on a frontline or in an operation the game is much more fun
[2:40:54] m4ttztv: game looks good, if u had a calculator as a pc
[2:41:01] SoloKx: @kkinty Massive Online war with one huge group vs another
[2:41:01] hops_gnommen: is the hermann miller worth the money? is it comfortable also after sitting hours on it?
[2:41:15] kkinty: @88solok lit
[2:41:29] okmangeez01: The front line is much more intense and extremely chaotic with shells and bullets flying everywhere. Right now, Summit and Shroud are wrecking enemy logistics and blowing stuff up behind enemy lines. Hence the slower game play.

[2:42:27] ZiggoPolska: bridge battles are not really fun, but at some moment one team breaks out and this is where the fun begins
[2:42:28] ChestRockweIl: what

[3:06:42] MRIrrelevant420: @Worldwide_____ actually not.  Base building, farming materials, crafting items, logistics, building bases, train tracks, supply runs, are all non pvp activities

[3:07:06] leckerer_keks: @KingRaden they are in their back lines sabotaging. not the frontlines where most players are.
[3:07:08] SAKEWITZ: any game where you can drive and only see 20 feet in front of yourself is stupid
[3:07:10] racecarstuntman: mist solos the war
[3:07:10] JayKmm: ohh no, the armored car is causing damage
[3:07:11] ZiggoPolska: it's a persistent world war game. With players all around the globe in different timezones. AI is needed to not let other team get upperhand while half of opposing team is asleep

[3:08:28] MRIrrelevant420: @Worldwide_____ since when does the enviroment have to be an enemy you can kill
[3:08:32] kittenkatten: @ExtraMildSauce you just respawn at the base you spawned in
[3:08:33] SWE_Major: If you die you respawn back at the base you set your spawn at
[3:08:44] ma1kawa11: You can kill structures which are a part of the environment, that's why this game has a PvE aspect

[3:08:55] MRIrrelevant420: @Worldwide_____ you don't know what pve means. Pve means player versus enviroment. Not enemy
[3:08:56] JakkoTiVi: @ExtraMildSauce 30 sec respawn timer basically. the problem is that by going behind enemy lines, getting there again might take half an hour
[3:08:57] MorgothSTW: you spend a thing called soldier supplies everytime you respawn btw those are player made aswell
[3:08:57] ElectricaJJ: @ennytm yeah ur oldschool and i love it!
[3:09:03] Girth__Brookz: @shroud That bloodless body means he can be turned into shirts at a hospital, its a low % drop when you die basically.

[3:26:30] Talon244092: U been to the front shroud?
[3:26:32] SWE_Major: There are a lot of different ways to play the game ...it's just that Summit loves partisan gameplay and he dragged Shroud with him
[3:26:34] Shakarak: front line is fun when using armor or mortars
[3:26:39] Dema7: Pog are you being partisans
[3:26:42] spiritofthebong: guerrilla tactics
[3:26:46] HayatoF89: deep behind enemylines doing sabotage =D
[3:26:48] raiden_jd: @shroud you planning on playing the new dayz namalsk update with smoke anytime soon?
[3:26:57] ma1kawa11: By the way shroud just want to say foxhole vets are excited to see you play the game :)
[3:27:00] Cannibowl: This game is popping off lately. I never watch Twitch and see Shroud streaming it... makes sense! New update and big names.
[3:27:03] olde_stoney1: How come you don't like Front Lining?
[3:27:03] Girth__Brookz: @zeelandfeyenoorder  Collies cant partisan the water very well
[3:27:04] CapEvasion: should have seen the slaughter I saw on the front earlier
[3:27:04] Archerian: @shroud you like the game?
[3:27:05] 8sgiandubh: lol trains aren’t even going to be a thing for a few more days
[3:27:05] SWE_Major: In tanks front is fun
[3:27:07] artvios: frontline is jus tossing bodies at the wall
[3:27:09] VafaFon: no rostermania news on ya?
[3:27:10] Vaebae_1: Frontline is good with a good leader, or if you’re winning LUL
[3:27:13] An_Artistic_Crab: whats the setting of the game? ww1 or ww2?
[3:27:17] leckerer_keks: @Cannibowl and #ad
[3:27:19] franto84: this is about war, right?
[3:27:19] CIAmindcontrol: frontline on Able is a blood bath, I already have over 300 revives as a medic and over 100,000 healing
[3:27:19] 8sgiandubh: gotta tech up to trains
[3:27:22] Vaebae_1: @an_artistic_crab yes
[3:27:22] techies_9001: if you need perma action, frontline looks to be it
[3:27:24] Girth__Brookz: WW1/WW2 mix
[3:27:25] MorpheusWar: they're paying out a lot of money getting these streamers to play it
[3:27:26] Jumper3917: tank frontline is fun or morty frontline, you become a one man army LUL
[3:27:26] monstertanks36: You gotta get in on actual organized operations like naval landings! Those are EPIC
[3:27:27] stretchingowl: @raiden892 we can only dream
[3:27:27] oleoay: @8sgiandubh there have been some small trains running around
[3:27:30] morphpogo: @olde_stoney1 he spent like 5 minutes at the frontline, wasn't even a very active one
[3:27:30] HayatoF89: mortars are fun too but you need spotter with binocs to range for you
[3:27:32] Cannibowl: frontline is fucking hectic and soooo fun. it's a vibe.
[3:27:32] groots_twig: Slow and steady, Not a die and regen feel to this
[3:27:33] Sammycosa: it was a minecart
[3:27:33] SWE_Major: There are big trains also
[3:27:35] BoogzTIA: a mall train
[3:27:36] ma1kawa11: @An_Artistic_Crab Early game is around WWII and as the game goes on it goes slightly past WWII in terms of technological development
[3:27:38] MorgothSTW: @An_Artistic_Crab you advance through tech so like ww1 ----> ww2 over time
[3:27:39] 8sgiandubh: @franto84 it’s hard yo explain
[3:27:41] Cannibowl: @leckerer_keks ahhh yeah
[3:27:43] 187StonedMason: @An_Artistic_Crab neither, its like WW1.5. It has its own lore and backstory
[3:27:46] Aceofspodes: @nice__killer o7
[3:27:46] OetziOfficial: hi what is this game about?
[3:27:46] Sammycosa: there are locomotives
[3:27:49] ma1kawa11: sorry, WWI* early game, WWII late game
[3:27:51] Girth__Brookz: Only thing WW1 about this game are the trenches
[3:27:54] raiden_jd: @stretchingowl love when they play together. the best dayz duo
[3:28:00] VafaFon: is that a LTT water bottle? XD
[3:28:02] CIAmindcontrol: @Aceofspodes o7
[3:28:03] ShroomyD: the front line experience can change drastically depending on location/tech etc
[3:28:13] ma1kawa11: @OetziOfficial MMO where everything is player driven, all the weapons are made by players, a complete sandbox war game
[3:28:19] franto84: @8sgiandubh okay than LUL NotLikeThis
[3:28:20] WTFATANK: go front line
[3:28:20] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[3:28:21] botpewpeww: @ShroomyD true, one time i went from the most peaceful frontline to hell on earth lol
[3:28:30] monstertanks36: Urban combat is insane! Or trench warfare with bayonets is crazy fun!!
[3:28:32] ZiggoPolska: the very early war is kinda fun, then it turns to be mostly meat grinder for some days, then tanks start to come in in scarce and you either cover it or run the hell out screaming :D and finally half of ppl can hop onto tanks and thats kinda fun
[3:28:32] VexLFO: I wanna play this game but can’t convince any of my friends to try it 😢
[3:28:32] 8sgiandubh: @franto84 essentially foxhole is about constant competition and the frontlines and special ops rely upon player based logistics
[3:28:34] reddevil_am: are aircrafts a thing in this game?
[3:28:35] arronmcfc: I love you Mikey
[3:28:39] Exia423: Even the buildings are made by players for the most part
[3:28:41] mrdabbalot: I be frontlining flanking going Rambo on the enemy team bakerxCheah bakerxJam bakerxRaylol bakerxShortyLol
[3:28:47] olde_stoney1: @reddevil_am No not yet they might put them in
[3:28:48] LoserGeekNerd: :)
[3:28:48] closuree_: The hell is this lol
[3:28:53] Talon244092: It has a ww2 plane at spawn (or one representing it) at least it ain’t a bi plane like ww1
[3:28:55] OetziOfficial: @OetziOfficial cool! thanks for the answer, player made weapns sounds fun!!
[3:28:58] leckerer_keks: @Cannibowl to be fair he was paid for 1 hour and is not playing for like 3 so he seems to like it
[3:29:00] oddmusic69: !setu
[3:29:00] closuree_: Is it pvp?
[3:29:06] oddmusic69: !setup
[3:29:08] SWE_Major: yes PVP
[3:29:10] abdastartos: no aircraft yet, big naval update is upcoming
[3:29:10] Girth__Brookz: Literally everything is player made in this game
[3:29:11] ma1kawa11: @reddevil_am No, unfortunately the top down perspective really limits it
[3:29:14] SWE_Major: with some AI defences
[3:29:16] Zoun19: like starcraft
[3:29:16] reddevil_am: @olde_stoney1 would be pretty good if the could implement it
[3:29:16] botpewpeww: @closuree_ yes, it is a ongoing war
[3:29:19] Aceofspodes: they have nukes @shroud
[3:29:20] LubedKitty: Add zombies turn it chaotic
[3:29:20] leckerer_keks: @Cannibowl "now" not "not"
[3:29:20] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[3:29:24] Talon244092: But the games tactics and some guns are very reminiscent of ww1
[3:29:25] jedimasteryu: this is like WW2 EVE type game
[3:29:28] BoogzTIA: It kinda has a Navy
[3:29:29] botpewpeww: @closuree_ depends on which teams put in the most effort
[3:29:30] ltduke_: the way sc2 does air combat would likely work
[3:29:32] olde_stoney1: Make your plane seethrough to drop bombs and to have a line like when your aiming your gun and have machine guns
[3:29:34] HayatoF89: @closuree_ yesit is pvp game on massive scale
[3:29:35] ZiggoPolska: every player has got their favourite phase of the war
[3:29:37] Jumper3917: It would be cool if they added parachute's and then you could drop behind enemy lines
[3:29:39] arronmcfc: your mods are actually goated KEKW they have to deal with so much when you play sponsored games that arent exactly the best hahaha
[3:29:39] ma1kawa11: @BoogzTIA we're expecting next big update to be a navy update btw
[3:29:45] ma1kawa11: although it's speculation
[3:29:46] Girth__Brookz: Navy is the next big update, Battleships n shit coming soon
[3:29:47] tokenstreamz: entire foxhole playerbase in this chat right now
[3:29:50] llama1lad: maybe being able to call in air support? but i think controlling a plane with this view would be awkward
[3:29:50] VafaFon: Wait is that a LTT water bottle????
[3:29:52] aldeeb94tv: !monitor
[3:29:53] StreamElements: @aldeeb94tv, He uses the Dell Alienware AW2721D 240Hz ips, https://amzn.com/dp/B08LR145ZY
[3:29:55] BoogzTIA: @ma1kawa11 would be nice
[3:29:56] franto84: @8sgiandubh i realy went to google translator to understand u NotLikeThis LUL
[3:29:57] reddevil_am: @ma1kawa11 true I understand.. would be cool if they figured something out tho
[3:29:58] squid_boi: hey big guy. when are you gonna show us YOUR foxhole? gachiBASS
[3:30:00] Niths: naval invasions are fun
[3:30:02] MorgothSTW: @arronmcfc its not about game being good or not they just require action every milisecond like fortnite or somethin
[3:30:03] lynax_: @ma1kawa11 would be cool if you could co-ordinate an attack and planes could just be AI controlled
[3:30:14] A1thur_: F1
[3:30:16] LogicalSolutions: Oh we still foxholin I love it
[3:30:18] lootedget: in the same region
[3:30:20] StreamElements: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[3:30:21] leckerer_keks: anywhere in the hexagon @shroud
[3:30:22] drneoprime: You have to be in same region or hex
[3:30:25] Girth__Brookz: Guys Foxhole is on sale right meow, GET IT! HELP THE WAR EFFORT!
[3:30:33] LubedKitty: Foxholio
[3:30:34] Hoaggy: he is saying he does
[3:30:42] squid_boi: I wanna see shroud's foxhole.
[3:30:46] helixxo: he loves it
[3:30:46] Paradoxsie: The same way you actualy like it?
[3:30:48] DMJaxun: @arronmcfc foxhole is amazing blasphemy sir
[3:30:48] aditya2140: reload gun
[3:30:54] ma1kawa11: @reddevil_am It would be nice, but my main concern is the balancing would be difficult and the devs are not the best at balancing pve.
[3:30:58] arronmcfc: @zeelandfeyenoorder Its a very aqcuired taste tho and not the FPS shroud viewers are used to so I can see the mods dealing with a lot of "this trash" ect KEKW
[3:31:02] bigwalby: its the top down, twin stick shooter ye
[3:31:05] space_turtle: isn't sacriel here? just ask him
[3:31:08] RepoManOG: I'm more of a 5th person kinda guy
[3:31:11] Paradoxsie: @arronmcfc Its so bad
[3:31:13] goredoh_: even 3rd person...
[3:31:15] Retro_Johnny: 64km (2) so that means its 8km x 8km?
[3:31:21] serthero1: hey isnt that summit you admired him to being a streaming?
[3:31:25] The_Holas: Sacriel sounded really excited to learn all what is happening in game
[3:31:25] HawkMan4k: Awww man. I had a blast in Foxhole. Comms and going through the frontline trenches. you get invested in the effort
[3:31:26] JaxPC: fps /3rd even probably just wouldn't work with the amount of players
[3:31:30] synzzo: hold down ctrl and scroll away 8)
[3:31:32] oleoay: people criticized lost ark for being isometric too
[3:31:32] johnburkisjunior: Yeah tbh one of the best things about planetside is its spectacle, Foxhole really misses out on that aspect due to its POV
[3:31:33] FatDabs_PLZ: Why is shrouds nose so shiny
[3:31:34] regie9000: HUH
[3:31:35] hate_xyz: HUH
[3:31:37] Talon244092: It wouldn’t run first person tho :(
[3:31:39] iponnen: gachiBASS
[3:31:39] CapEvasion: they have another game in development like this but medieval tech
[3:31:39] zerosand1z: This would be good on Steam Deck
[3:31:45] leckerer_keks: @arronmcfc foxhole is good tho
[3:31:48] reddevil_am: @ma1kawa11 yeah true..
[3:31:53] botpewpeww: when i played this game i was always doing Logi runs
[3:31:56] Girth__Brookz: Its a unique game
[3:31:56] fuutonstream: running simulator?
[3:31:59] closuree_: Feel like a mini map would make it way better
[3:32:02] tokenstreamz: foxhole players in chat desperate to revive the game
[3:32:03] DMJaxun: @zerosand1z its semi compatible
[3:32:06] FatDabs_PLZ: Why is shrouds nose so shiny?
[3:32:08] closuree_: But that’s just me
[3:32:11] arronmcfc: @tokenstreamz KEKW
[3:32:14] HayatoF89: lol mud people
[3:32:14] zeelandfeyenoorder: @arronmcfc Dno why I got timed out (prolly a keyword) but I got untimed out. Click my last message.
[3:32:22] MadaFasakra: what is this walking simulator?
[3:32:23] headfirstdroptx: @fatdabsplz3 cocaine
[3:32:24] Paradoxsie: When i played this game it was Death after death, it was so boaring
[3:32:24] Jumper3917: It may not be 1st person, but being able to mine resources, refine it, build bases/supplies and then supplying it to the front lines I think makes it better
[3:32:26] DarunDemo: is this a sell out
[3:32:30] TheRagingUnicorn: @zeelandfeyenoorder the bot got you and i took the timeout off of oyu
[3:32:32] TheRagingUnicorn: you
[3:32:34] A1thur_: @tokenstreamz Not even dead game.
[3:32:35] leckerer_keks: @johnburkisjunior i like the teamplay and thats even more important here. but its personal preference
[3:32:38] zeelandfeyenoorder: @TheRagingUnicorn <3 ty
[3:32:38] MorgothSTW: @Paradoxsie what did u expect from a war game
[3:32:40] ZiggoPolska: @closuree_ they have minimap, but Shroud is not using it, so he doesnt leak intelligence
[3:32:46] thatboybryan07: cuz shroud showers like a normal person
[3:32:49] bengalbroys: @TheRagingUnicorn shroudWave
[3:32:51] zeelandfeyenoorder: Oooooh flatbed, nicee
[3:32:53] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: oh shit fuel truck
[3:32:54] BoogzTIA: diesel?
[3:32:54] ma1kawa11: poor dude was delivering fuel :(
[3:32:55] 10jiin: gameplay reminds of Project Zomboid
[3:32:56] goredoh_: lol this combat
[3:32:57] SWE_Major: Yes there is weather in the game Rain and snow and it impacts the gameplay in those regions
[3:32:59] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: poor guy
[3:33:00] CodemanLUL: @TheRagingUnicorn, shroudWave
[3:33:01] ShiruShirudo: does anyone know who the idiot shouting on the Xbox add is ? he looks rabid lol

[3:33:14] olde_stoney1: Poor guy :c
[3:33:15] botpewpeww: hes just trying to do some logi runs man
[3:33:19] RepoManOG: We got oil bois
[3:33:21] closuree_: Broooooo imagine if there was proximity chat
[3:33:22] olde_stoney1: Need the QRF to help
[3:33:23] slowtempos: you know these guys are like fuck this
[3:33:25] leckerer_keks: @ZiggoPolska they hit like 10 ppl already
[3:33:27] zeelandfeyenoorder: @closuree_ There is.
[3:33:29] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: he just trying to do logi runs man poor guy

[3:33:42] Jumper3917: RIP hard working logi guys
[3:33:43] leckerer_keks: @g0dfreefps yes
[3:33:43] closuree_: @zeelandfeyenoorder Okay that’s kinda cool
[3:33:43] arronmcfc: I genuinely dont get it but not against it. Not my style of game but I can see the appeal
[3:33:45] zeelandfeyenoorder: @g0dfreefps It's the best war sim in my opinion, it's hugeeee. But it needs time to get used to.
[3:33:46] Girth__Brookz: @g0dfreefps  No game is like Foxhole
[3:33:49] FatDabs_PLZ: @headfirstdroptx I like coco
[3:33:52] Rachehamut: Get out and be executed, or wait inside and hope for help
[3:33:54] Exusprime: BibleThump  stop hes alredy dead
[3:33:57] Mikoloro_: Does the game have proximity chat? If so is it required?
[3:33:58] ImortlTecniques: hows this game solo?
[3:34:02] Arccali: poor guy

[3:34:10] hate_xyz: NotLikeThis
[3:34:13] ma1kawa11: @ImortlTecniques This is not a game to play solo, the point of it is to cooperate with others
[3:34:13] RepoManOG: Behind Enemy Lines
[3:34:15] Girth__Brookz: Used to have enemy VOIP but not anymore
[3:34:18] olde_stoney1: Yeah this game has voip and is really good
[3:34:19] Shakarak: switch to pistol?
[3:34:21] absynth123: @Mikoloro_ It does have it, not required but helps a lot to coordinate or organize
[3:34:21] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: behind enemy lines with no ammo
[3:34:22] Paradoxsie: @ImortlTecniques Do not buy if u want to play solo
[3:34:23] g0dfreefps: Thanks for letting me know
[3:34:25] abdastartos: text and voice proximity
[3:34:26] asayuhhh: you can do a lot solo
[3:34:26] Shakarak: logistics
[3:34:27] botpewpeww: I did logi runs as solo

[3:34:28] RukuTV: I like to solo logi
[3:34:28] JaxPC: solo partisan GIGACHAD
[3:34:29] Jumper3917: I am surprised they were left to their own devices for so long, usually partisans would be dealth with swiftly
[3:34:29] oleoay: ive been a solo medic on the front line, and you can solo logi
[3:34:29] GlovesPoker: you can do solo logi

[3:35:15] katsarulis: i am playing the game solo now. found a squad and playing frontline with them. they are like 30ppl or smth
[3:35:15] Jumper3917: You could also build a tank/gunboat, find other people to join you in it and then go front lines
[3:35:17] ZiggoPolska: you will get yelled at by clanmen when building solo clueless tho
[3:35:18] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: yo ammo resupply
[3:35:18] Girth__Brookz: You can do anything solo
[3:35:25] Girth__Brookz: The best players are SOLO
[3:35:26] Mikoloro_: @absynth123 Thanks!
[3:35:28] abdastartos: There are public squads you can join and team up with people
[3:35:32] StonedCapone: people will get mad at you if you solo xqcOmega
[3:35:36] ma1kawa11: @ZiggoPolska poor ssgt just wanted to build a trench :(
[3:35:39] LubedKitty: Dig foxholes on foxhole
[3:35:40] zeelandfeyenoorder: It's also fun to just fill up a fueltruck as solo and push frontlines with tanks, keep 'em refueled
[3:35:45] Paradoxsie: @sirsmokesome Is that a new thing?
[3:35:54] MorgothSTW: @sirsmokesome bru no
[3:35:56] oleoay: bullets are the new meta ;)
[3:35:59] Jumper3917: One war with one boat and a other randoms we managed to destroy atleast 3-4 enemy boats and destroyed a lot of enemy bases it was lots of fun
[3:36:00] Girth__Brookz: Only thing you need a squad for is building a base
[3:36:01] botpewpeww: @sirsmokesome no you could always do it
[3:36:05] olde_stoney1: NOT MY LOGI BOYS D:
[3:36:05] Sycuown: is there micro skill in this game, seems like everything is macro

[3:36:44] morphpogo: it's baker server, no QRF there
[3:36:45] Girth__Brookz: its called "Shadowdancing"

[3:36:58] SWE_Major: so what they are doing does a big impact on the frontlines
[3:36:59] RepoManOG: wrench OP
[3:36:59] StonedCapone: yes i was warden and build my own tank and some people got mad xqcOmega
[3:37:03] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: disrupting the frontlien supplies
[3:37:03] botpewpeww: they are actually doing something, they are disrupting logistics lmao
[3:37:05] JaxPC: it'd be great if yall belw an ammo truck KEKW
[3:37:05] BoogzTIA: death before dismount
[3:37:06] Rachehamut: Kinda sad how small arms take a truck out that fast
[3:37:07] ChaoticErebus: @shroud You should try building vehicles, weapons and buildings

[3:37:24] RepoManOG: SUMMIT DOWN
[3:37:25] Merpy_Meep: I love playing as a medic in the frontlines
[3:37:26] Herthan: Why would you get out though? Just to get shot? May as well make the vehicle unusable and get them to waste some more ammo?
[3:37:31] RepoManOG: I repeat Tango Dow
[3:37:32] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: o7
[3:37:34] olde_stoney1: @StonedCapone Then they stupid if they get mad at you for building your own tank, cause if you farmed the mats then its your tank. They salty butthurt beverly
[3:37:35] zeelandfeyenoorder: @thekaiido It's a war sim. Thousands of players in one world.

[3:37:52] The_Holas: Press 8 for Salute @shroud
[3:37:52] lootedget: yes
[3:37:53] Talon244092: For those who dont know stopping supply lines gives wardens a massive disadvantage at the frontline
[3:37:53] zeelandfeyenoorder: @thekaiido Every weapon, vehicle, bullet, defense, base, etc, is made by actual players.
[3:37:54] ElectricaJJ: @pablo1682 yes pablo he cares whats ur writing man
[3:37:54] thekaiido: @zeelandfeyenoorder aight bet. thanks!
[3:37:56] thatboybryan07: whats the loot like.?

[3:38:08] GoodCharles: Hey, why is there a banner of the game on bottom left? Is this sponsored? PogChamp
[3:38:15] BILLYDARKO: No, he's depressed and gaming isnt giving him the fulfillment he needs to have the best life

[3:39:07] MelyTheNeko: huzza
[3:39:10] Beastin420: Is there a high skill threshold in this game?

[3:39:18] olde_stoney1: @SWE_Major Surprisingly there's not many kids playing it thank god LUL
[3:39:20] SWE_Major: The game is super deep
[3:39:23] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: @Beastin420 very high
[3:39:27] Convard: Can summit load up a vehicle with a load of ammo and take it back to them?
[3:39:30] zeelandfeyenoorder: @Beastin420 Fully depends on what you do. Frontline combat, kinda, but logi is a bit more accessible imo.
[3:39:32] SWE_Major: I know lol thank god one of the best things about the game
[3:39:35] Arccali: @olde_stoney1 kids doesnt play this shit because its too hard for them
[3:39:36] A1thur_: If you get a kill you get a commend. I think the max you can have at one time is 5. you can commend one person 3 times a day.
[3:39:36] Paradoxsie: @zeelandfeyenoorder solo = drive back and forth over and over for nothing but commends. Or die over and over on front line, That is litraly all there is to this game as solo

[3:39:47] botpewpeww: @Convard he can or lose a ton of ammo lmao
[3:39:52] ZiggoPolska: You just should be willing to learn
[3:39:54] Captainclappy: How does the Game have such a huge Map ?
[3:39:58] laggistv: !subs
[3:39:58] StreamElements: @laggistv, his sub count is at least 1 shroudKEK
[3:40:04] zeelandfeyenoorder: @Paradoxsie Let's agree to disagree LULW
[3:40:13] olde_stoney1: @Tpro4 Agreed Partisaning is hard and needs skill. Frontline is a real good ole meatgrinder
[3:40:15] ma1kawa11: @A1thur_ It is 3 kills per commend but you can do logi to get them a lot faster. Max you can store is 100, you can onl;y commend 1 person 3 times, with a total daily limit of 60 commends that you can give out to multiple people
[3:40:18] Convard: @botpewpeww worth the risk 😂
[3:40:21] SWE_Major: Because the World is divided into 37 big hexagon maps
[3:40:31] morphpogo: @Captainclappy the world map is split up into 37 hexes/regions, each holding up to like 120v120 players.
[3:40:32] Barisonn: Is shroud playing WOW rn? LUL
[3:40:41] StonedCapone: xqcS

[3:41:27] 187StonedMason: xqcS xqcSword
[3:41:33] SWE_Major: They are not at the frontline they are behind enmy lines
[3:41:38] zeelandfeyenoorder: @Captainclappy Yea but you can obviously just travel the whole world. Every separate hex is just a separate instance.
[3:41:45] Convard: @botpewpeww he’s a gamer, I reckon he’ll manage 😂
[3:41:48] morphpogo: @crazyspecz he is in the middle of nowhere behind enemy lines, not anywhere near the big frontlines that have dozens of players on each side
[3:41:52] MorgothSTW: @Captainclappy each hexagon is a server but you travel between them and that creates a huge map takes like 5 sec to travel between them so its a huge world
[3:41:53] ma1kawa11: @crazyspecz They are in the enemy backlines. You can do whatever you want in this game. The frontline is crazy combat
[3:41:54] Mikoloro_: Ok I surrendered. Purchased and downloading now. :\
[3:41:56] 187StonedMason: @crazyspecz They are hitting the supply lines

[4:57:55] nukiyu__: I mlove the fact that everyone think that retail is "Dead" ´- Wrath literally just came out, ofcourse people are trying it. Retail will always end out being superior.
[4:58:08] fen_: it's a classic stream, so ofc classic fanboys feel the need to invent doomsday stories whole-cloth to justify not playing retail

[5:41:22] Karsa06: you'd rather get stam and sbv on other pieces over the dodge on badge shield
[5:41:30] Exigaet: @Exigaet The literal first mention I've seen of it since WotLK launched was right now lol

[5:42:15] Karsa06: they're selling for like 2500 on grob
[5:42:20] Aperture6: 4k on AH
[5:42:26] officialtansei: @Exigaet thats cuz u never played wotlk servers, ive played wotlk private servers for over 7 years, everyone uses gearscore as a whole, you use ilvl for item specific talk.

[5:43:20] mhz1d: yah sunwell has like 4 or 5 warlock pre - bis
[5:43:28] Exigaet: @officialtansei I played in original WotLK, so I know about gearscore, just seems like something that private server players are trying to bring back
[5:43:29] gojheera: thats a level 60 enchant lol

[5:44:50] drpraecox: feed me thijsSanic_TK
[5:44:57] officialtansei: @Exigaet no lol, overall ilvl didnt exist back in wotlk lol, you had item level for items but not a general ilvl, this shit came literally in cata/mop, you have a general gearscore, like retri bis is 6.9k , war 6.7k and every other class 6.5k, its always been like that in every single wotlk server even retail lol.
[5:45:00] gojheera: adds gem slot to belt

[5:46:20] Zakuras: LULW
[5:46:20] Exigaet: @officialtansei I know itemlevel wasn't a thing in original WotLK and everyone had the addon to see how geared people were. Again, you're trying to bring back something from private servers that has no place in retail. Gear doesn't matter when people can literally swipe to get it

[6:32:10] Kenobirino: that way you never gona miss a Taunt, cuz if you do it could provoque a wipe
[6:32:16] Zakuras: people say you should replace glyphs constantly, in reality you stick with 3. holy wrath is useless, divine plea is ok only if youre actually worried about migitation
