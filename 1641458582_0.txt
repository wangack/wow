Found you through yt the other day and just wanted to say you bring such a fun, positive energy to the WOW community! I've been a casual player for about 5 years now and am hoping to get into the more competive sides of WOW with the upcoming Dragonflight expan and you've helped motivate me so thank you. P.S. sorry for the rambling, Crinkle is the most ferociously adorable warrior who has inspired me to explore more roles <3
[0:10:40] oscarmikel: Been away from WoW for around a year. I'm a casual solo player that loves levelling characters from zero with heirlooms and moving on to another class.  How is the latest xpac looking for solo alt characters - is it friendly?
[0:10:46] Killdozer77: Are they going to fix TSM?  I know you arent the dev but I'm having a lot of problems with the app.
[0:10:54] CanadianHeavy: yes
[0:11:05] badak531: have you noticed tsm randomly blocking the use if consumables like augment runes or learning a pet/mount? it happens evey so often and I need to reload ui to clear
[0:11:09] exalted1715: the naulis shirt is a great
[0:11:14] oscarmikel: Acronym?
[0:11:22] Daemavand: I sent a selfie in a sweater to friends in Calgary and they were not impressed lol

[0:13:18] Octopixy1971: I love the big Murloc mount from the 12 month subscription did you get it to Hazel?
[0:13:19] superchief86: worth starting it, selecting threads, just in case you ever want to go to the shadowlands in the future

[0:16:01] brianmixwell: kitty!!!
[0:16:01] FuzzyGrendel: It would be cool if it flies using its ears as wings.
[0:16:02] Zuldak: She's probably confused that there is no sun spot to lay in
[0:16:07] srs_business: Imagine the drama if it was the Rooster or Spectral Tiger instead of just the Feldrake
[0:16:12] derrickbehunter: Do you regret buying the fel drake now?
[0:16:21] Leuko_cyte: As a streamer you enable them in your  creator dashboard under "Viewer Rewards"
[0:16:23] ISwearIShotYou: It does fly

[0:18:12] m4keyourself: one more thing people find a reason to complain about but I love them
[0:18:14] Saldar4170: the harvest golem for gifting twitch subs
[0:18:20] Zuldak: it would go well with ardenweld armor
[0:18:27] soundzGOOD: it has the same colours as the astral transmog from the shop
[0:18:28] Gynebra: It´s really pretty!
[0:18:29] armadilloaaron: Aaaaaa I want that beetle but the commitment of a 12 month subscription is scary
[0:18:31] Karlpybara: nov 28 to dec 12 is the period for the scarecrow pet from 2 gifted subs
[0:18:34] kimbjohn: when my cat is cold, she will follow me around until I sit down and she can sit in my lap. ❤️
[0:18:40] derrickbehunter: Will all WoW creators be eligible to watch for the twitch drops?
[0:18:42] tyluh_ok: Hi hazel. What mount is that and how’d you get it?
[0:18:45] Pewling: Wait you have to gift subs to get an item in the MMO that we already pay a sub for? mopO
[0:18:46] m4keyourself: really gotta lock you in lol
[0:18:50] Zuldak: they used to have 12 month subs a long time ago
[0:19:00] superchief86: I do wish the 12 months gave you slightly more discount
[0:19:05] corient7: Hi Hazel!
[0:19:11] Leuko_cyte: @Pewling You don'
[0:19:17] zeprot: Morning Hazel :)
[0:19:23] Kurama__95: To me even 6 months is too long of a comitment
[0:19:26] onybear: I do skill share for a year…why not wow?
[0:19:33] derrickbehunter: They should add a one time wow sub purchase for the rest of wows run time
[0:19:36] BigLousClubhouse: Apple+ Disney+ and PlayStation are all 12 month subs for me
[0:19:39] Leuko_cyte: You dont nneed to have the mount really
[0:19:46] BigLousClubhouse: This will be just one more
[0:19:50] m4keyourself: you don't "have" to do anything
[0:19:51] Rigelhoof: 10$ for a pet is normal.
[0:19:54] Saldar4170: the costmetic/collector game has always been a different game tho

[0:20:34] lorewell: it really boggles my mind to see people getting mad about cosmetics, noones forces u to buy stuff
[0:20:36] derrickbehunter: Is there a reason you’re not leveling to 60?
[0:20:46] Antguy2001: I want to level an alt but can’t make up my mind on the class 😔
[0:20:48] JinnaiLaf: Hellooo
[0:20:52] andre3v89: zele means cabbage in Bulgarian ;p
[0:21:04] Nick_Dainuhsor: Hey Hazel! Hope you're well! Can you main Holy while solo leveling?
[0:21:04] Kurama__95: My endgoal is 2 alts of every class... On each faction LUL
[0:21:11] austons: I thought one character is going to be able to collect all armor types in a few patches?
[0:21:18] yurpally: I just started a shaman, it's such a fun class.
[0:21:20] jaymjs: highmountain tauren bis movement
[0:21:28] Zuldak: @andre3v89 how do you pronounce it? Zee lee or zel e?

[0:22:41] Daemavand: I love trolls so so much <3
[0:22:45] JinnaiLaf: Chat, help me pick a main for DF. Any range will do o:
[0:22:51] yurpally: oh wow, Crinkle is 50 already! nice
[0:22:59] shadowheals31: Lock
[0:23:00] Daemavand: I love how alts are a form of creative expression. So many things to imagine
[0:23:12] sence_00: there's a console command on the forums to force your UI editor to show!
[0:23:17] superchief86: yeah no edit mode in exiles reach is silly sauce
[0:23:24] yurpally: I second Lock for @JinnaiLaf
[0:23:25] derrickbehunter: I leveled my Tauren rogue through the mulgore starting zone and it felt like it took around the same time as exiles reach

[0:24:13] airdewyn_sky: im committing to my druid- i will learn a dps off spec- not just heals
[0:24:19] JinnaiLaf: @yurpally How are locks for M+? Not to push keys, just to do weekly stuff. Always felt like they take forever to deal dmg compared to other classes
[0:24:24] LKatey75: BM is awesome but my main still does MM
[0:24:31] derrickbehunter: Can’t you send alliance gold to horde now?
[0:24:37] srs_business: Warlocks and mages are always nice to main if you want to play ranged dps, since there's 3 specs are most of the time one of them will be above average
[0:24:38] Perkolate: any new mog you get for mail will work for a future evoker
[0:24:40] Rigelhoof: Blood elf questing zone is pretty fun.
[0:24:43] m4keyourself: This is my expansion. Dragons. Can be a dragon. Released on my birthday. It's my time to shine!
[0:24:46] hemsath1: Stonetalon? I never go there personally
[0:25:00] armadilloaaron: I have no clue what I want to main in dragonflight, been thinking about either my vulpera warlock or my worgen warrior and play my evoker some too
[0:25:03] JinnaiLaf: Tried leveling BM but I somehow their gameplay doesn't click with me at all
[0:25:06] brianmixwell: ele sham is good. enhance just got 25% all dmg nerfs and nerfs to toolkit this week (sadface) looks like im staying ele for DF
[0:25:13] Shadewolfe117: Hi Hazel! Finally caught a livestream!
[0:25:14] Fellbundle: haha this is exactly how i chose my leveling zones now. Doing all the worst quest for that sweet sweet mog :D
[0:25:15] sence_00: belf zones are pretty efficient
[0:25:16] Hyple: starting at the orc level 1-5 area is giving good xp and it is fast, you don't need the gear since you have heirlooms. At least that's what i did
[0:25:16] Daemavand: Aye now is THE time to experiment with alts and/or specs
[0:25:18] darthduk: Check Silverpine into Hillsbrad. I've found that was the fastest to level 1-30 as Horde
[0:25:22] Shadewolfe117: Ooohh All The Things. Dangerous addon ther lmao
[0:25:41] lorewell: I thing u can when u choose cataclysm from chromie no?
[0:25:49] derrickbehunter: Silver pine is a great horde zone
[0:25:58] yurpally: @JinnaiLaf Locks are usually always decent dps. I love a frost mage too.
[0:26:01] JinnaiLaf: Are Mages still so proc heavy? I feel like you hardly hardcast anything as fire or frostz
[0:26:06] Shadewolfe117: @lorewell Catacylsm counts all the 'vanilla' zones too.
[0:26:18] Henshini: FYI, i just finished the main quests in bfa on my first horde alt and I was still gaining full quest xp after 50. Plus you can do BFA endgame quests after 50.
[0:26:19] jeffdmk: if you right click on the quest it will show you the entire quest chain
[0:26:22] jaymjs: Desolace ResidentSleeper
[0:26:25] Kurama__95: Get into Chromie time first, so you don't get hard stopped at 30
[0:26:34] zanderjayc: a good place is eastern kingdom silver pine is the best
[0:26:35] sence_00: desolace!
[0:26:38] beaconhills07: silverpine forest 10/10
[0:26:44] superchief86: @jinnailaf frost is amazing right now. but yeah, lots of procs
[0:26:51] Rigelhoof: Portal to UC.
[0:26:52] chivmuffin: Can't wait for the 15th when you can do Chromie Time all the way to 60 and skip Shadowlands
[0:26:54] McScooterson: !addcommand !DropInfo Here's what we know so far about Twitch Drops for WoW https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23873861/updated-nov-1-dragonflight-twitch-drops-earn-rewards-watching-and-supporting-creators
[0:26:54] Streamlabs: McScooterson -> Succesfully added !dropinfo.
[0:26:58] derrickbehunter: Something I did different with this current alt I’m leveling is enchanting my heirlooms and getting a rare addon that puts all them on my map, they give a lot of xp at lower levels!
[0:26:58] Brewmaster_Holsten: that voice became so distracting when I got hooked on Hearthstone and learned who Ben Brode was
[0:26:59] Burritosalad: wow is awesome pog
[0:27:04] Octopixy1971: cant you use the portal when you use the scouting maps?

[0:27:39] Octopixy1971: Up the tower
[0:27:40] m4keyourself: Well my dogs stick their face in mine to say hi and tend to burp. Not sure which is better haha
[0:27:41] Sacrenos: For Horde I do Legion chromie with the skip, so you won't get locked at 30 in hillsbrad, go silverpine and hillsbrad, then do WoD till 50
[0:27:58] Gynebra: <3
[0:28:00] Octopixy1971: On the Zeppelin tower
[0:28:18] zanderjayc: kill the rares in the immediate area  along with herbing and mining for extra xp
[0:28:24] derrickbehunter: Silverpine and duskwood for alliance are the first zones I always to to wuen I get to lvl 10, I find them so efficient and fun
[0:28:25] sence_00: it was a zep until UC got destroyed
[0:28:26] Sacrenos: it was a zeppelin, and then undercity got.... messed up a bit
[0:28:29] beaconhills07: fire mage!!!
[0:28:46] headlocks000: Dark Iron Engineer Mage for mount farming :)
[0:28:47] derrickbehunter: Pretty sure it’s been a portal since bfa
[0:28:52] Sunabubus: I've been leveling a bunch of alts too, and I still have no idea about how Chromie time works or how to "abuse it". I don't even know why I start WoD with chromie but I just do. lol
[0:29:02] korialstraz90: @sacrenos just a bit
[0:29:04] enokifungus: I leveled a tauran mage to 60. It wasn't too bad.

[0:29:37] McScooterson: Haven't kept up... or forever scene cutter?
[0:29:41] goldendanny17: What about pirates? Pew pew
[0:29:43] BigLousClubhouse: The fact Mage is the ONLY class with no self heal is a huge deterrence for me
[0:29:47] forebringer: Stops you at 30 if you don't
[0:29:48] Sunabubus: nice I'm not the only one with chromie :D
[0:29:50] m4keyourself: As a leveling DPS, LFG has been popping off. Not much time for groups because I think so many people leveling
[0:29:55] TheGaymerBear: I know you get this question every day multiple times, but have you set your mind on a main for DF yet? :x
[0:29:56] Zuldak: i dont know what the point is in throwing stink bombs in under city. Like... could it already smell worse?
[0:30:00] srs_business: WoD feels super overrated for leveling. I like parts of it as Alliance (intro, early SMV up to Embaari Village, early Gorgrond) but that's about it
[0:30:00] m4keyourself: usually bout 5 mins as a dps in lfg
[0:30:07] korialstraz90: Then to find elevator outside
[0:30:09] m4keyourself: yum
[0:30:12] jaymjs: do i have to have one character at lvl 60 for the pre-patch chromie time thingy to apply?

[0:43:42] McScooterson: @eiaed Only way around this for me is grating nutmeg any time i need it
[0:43:51] ezshopper31: Irish Spring soap chopped into pieces on your fence keeps deer away
[0:43:53] HappyFOV: You now suffer from feline paralysis
[0:43:57] GHOST97915: @Parazetamol91 copying a great idea is just being inspired :)

[0:51:16] Ryok: i have the 6 month sub and man there's months i can't even afford that and gotta hope that's not the month it's due D:
[0:51:20] McScooterson: Nutmeg is a seed

[0:51:48] hemsath1: Milk, chives, butter, garlic, salt, paprika
[0:51:49] Riku1839: your stomach thinks all potatoes are mashed potatoes

[0:52:04] Gidget2324: @macydoes_  I did that a few weeks ago and it took me 3 days worth of trying (only a couple hours at a time)
[0:52:19] Ryok: mashed potatos for me are potatos, milk, bit of butter salt and nutmeg
[0:52:28] pseudobudo: Did you get the alpha version without overwolf?
[0:52:33] IanSabrewolfe: Also, ironically enough, nutmeg is poisonous.  Fortunately it take a massive amount to be dangerous to humans.

[0:53:18] Gidget2324: @macydoes_ You as well! It was not a fun achievement lol the unicorn is awesom ethough!
[0:53:20] IanSabrewolfe: @Parazetamol91 The red stuff that surrounds the seed is good, too.

[0:53:39] JohntheBarbarian: the murrl is JUICED

[0:54:25] TotallyNotRaien: 48hr stream on df launch
[0:54:28] Librarian21London: Wasn't there a really long magetower stream?
[0:54:39] Alannalouwho: up to you but streaming on launch day would be awesome to watch :D
[0:54:40] deadschemes: Does anyone else get like a latency bug or something where abilities and spells stop working and you cant log out?
[0:54:42] McScooterson: Mace! That's it. Couldn't remember the outside bit
[0:54:46] AxelyuS7: uu big murloc
[0:54:49] janahita: seems like for the drops it's 4 hours of content
[0:54:56] Dave_Growl: They updated the twitch drop info page today.  Its on the bnet launcher
[0:55:02] IanSabrewolfe: Yup, mace.  Great stuff!
[0:55:22] onybear: A lot of my favorite streamers are going to be on, I will have to split my time between all of you guys lol
[0:55:32] erinnightz: maby do it on hazleafterdrak for the  launch  day
[0:55:33] Ryok: level 2 sounds like way too much work for me D:
[0:55:44] cashthb: write your own addons, lua doesn't look so bad
[0:55:45] AxelyuS7: the raid frames are so bugged cant use the ready button sometimes
[0:55:46] IanSabrewolfe: @onybear Tabs FtW.
[0:55:49] m4keyourself: That's super smart - so much garbage runs in the background..
[0:55:52] Ujai321: max paranoia is not playing wow. you get monitored all the time. don't run windows, either.
[0:55:57] Sovcat: 100% agree. So much bloat.
[0:55:58] Streaming_Things: I do them all manually. Some fishy things were happening with my system last year.
[0:56:08] Sovcat: Adobe is a huge culprit as well.
[0:56:15] elsiefleur: yeah i always install custom rather than let everything install itself
[0:56:20] solkana: Windows constantly resetting my audio settings with updates. :|
[0:56:22] Cainnar: tik tok is a utility for basic people
[0:56:23] windswhisperuk: Hi there
[0:56:25] cuppawithcat: WOAH, your windows installs apps without permission?
[0:56:29] CoffeeASAP: tiktok is an essential worker these days :(
[0:56:33] KnaughTKnuckles: KnaughTKnuckles subscribed at Tier 1.

[0:56:35] Alannalouwho: eesh i would hate tiktok being automatically installed lol
[0:56:47] BigLousClubhouse: 80% of the time the "optional" software has checkboxes to UN-check while installing other stuff
[0:57:15] Shadewolfe117: We gotta see how launch is anyways. It might be a bit messy so streaming could end up being a lot of "Queue gaming"
[0:57:22] m4keyourself: Asmon has mods insta-ban people like that lol
[0:57:25] MagicManatea: kitty so cute, burrowing in
[0:57:28] Alannalouwho: awww yeah i totally get that! i hate when people compare all the time too XD
[0:57:34] voropeza2: :)
[0:57:48] Sunabubus: tiktok is very worrying because it's from a country where these laws are handled very loosely
[0:58:00] bodhirana: Never thought watching a kitty sleep would be so amusing. More people need kittycams.
[0:58:07] CoffeeASAP: yeah launch days are days I make a todo list and get errands done, I dont even bother trying anymore lol
[0:58:12] m4keyourself: @HazelNuttyGames Asmon said you're a great content creator and people should support your stream recently in a video
[0:58:13] Ujai321: if you were more sensitive to peer pressure, you would go 24 hours on launch, so there is that
[0:58:16] macydoes_: Have you tried the new raid in beta? How did it go?
[0:58:16] superchief86: hey they've extended the twitch drop event periods for the mount and the kite pet by one day each
[0:58:19] Sunabubus: if tiktok was a french company's app, or a german then it would be fine.
[0:58:40] m4keyourself: while he was reading the rage forum posts about the feldrake lol
[0:59:19] windswhisperuk: Since the patch I have trouble swapping from my speakers to headphones it just wont switch
[0:59:21] TheWeepingBadger: owah where you get the mount?
[0:59:40] Alannalouwho: yikes
[0:59:50] sundayz58: i keep activating my office 2013 license, just to make them mad. barley use it :D
[0:59:55] Ryok: @WeepingxxBadger it's part of the 12 month sub deal right now D:
[1:00:01] IanSabrewolfe: LibreOffice is The Way.
[1:00:03] ultigadium: man, I have to use Microsoft
[1:00:08] cuppawithcat: right! you used to be able to buy an affordable word licensed, it is disgraceful
[1:00:12] Abysse: Windows is really starting to get on my nerve, yea and now getting ads in start menu and random stuff about thing I do not care about
[1:00:16] Librarian21London: Well Microsoft will be the owner of Activision and so WoW soon
[1:00:17] TheWeepingBadger: @Ryok Oooo
[1:00:20] quickdrypaint: goodbye computer hello root vegetable
[1:00:24] McScooterson: Maybe if it was Winamp sure
[1:00:28] jeffdmk: you should switch to linux
[1:00:36] yarema_on: Microsoft buying blizzard just to mess with Hazel
[1:00:48] cuppawithcat: @abysse ads in the start menu??? is this the new windows?
[1:00:50] matthiaskaese: office 1yr costs 36€, it's not that bad right
[1:00:51] Ryok: @Librarian21London if the deal goes through next summer D: still quite a bit away imo
[1:01:14] TheWeepingBadger: If I could run Wow well on linux...
[1:01:15] invisiblematter: good to know
[1:01:23] TotallyNotRaien: my brain still reads sepulcher as spelucher
[1:01:26] heyhannah: troll time arexPog
[1:01:37] Alannalouwho: awww yeah he did talk really highly of you! it was sweet! i did watch that too
[1:01:46] necroticlolxd: blackrock foundry was the goat
[1:01:47] m4keyourself: he was making fun of them and it was hilarious
[1:01:48] Ujai321: bye Kira
[1:01:51] CoffeeASAP: if I wanted to read that I'd turn map chat back on lol
[1:02:14] Delarac: Haven been very up to date with the dragonflight content but I've seen that some of the mogs have a "renown" version, do we have some sort of covenant sistem again? haven't seen the rage of the communitty so no power related to them for sure
[1:02:19] Librarian21London: Sorry if I missed this. Has Hazel already solved the migraine mystery?
[1:02:33] Sunabubus: I have like a 5 year old windows but I remember I had to dig into regedit and stop services and look for special uninstallers to get rid of some of the bloatware. I don't dar to upgrade to win11 for this reason
[1:02:40] Ryok: as someone who'd never get the feldrake i'm lookin forward to it a lot because it's my favorite dragon mount and i wanted it for a long time
[1:02:40] Alannalouwho: oh nice! she can grab her headphone thing now XD
[1:02:54] Vazeelthun: I asume we can just gift subs on your channel for the pet right? @HazelNuttyGames
[1:03:03] JinnaiLaf: Do you know if we'll have something similar to Withered Training from Legion in DF? Really liked that system
[1:03:04] DarkEnforcer: DarkEnforcer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hazel will your channel be eligeble for the twitch and blizz drops ??

[1:07:09] MAXXtheFiXer: is that the default nameplates or some addons?
[1:07:27] jellyjim_: What do you think about chaning career in my 30s? like going back to college in my 30s

[1:10:09] TotallyNotRaien: you can turn the wow tokens into wow balance
[1:10:09] IanSabrewolfe: @McScooterson Same, mate, same.
[1:10:15] McScooterson: @Perkolate If you turn it into blizz bucks can you?
[1:10:20] tyrygosa13: I went back to college in my 30s
[1:10:28] Librarian21London: So, no lion taming then?
[1:10:31] jmalmin: this mount... dosnt it use the same animation as the mage tower druid bear form?
[1:10:33] Perkolate: I dont think so. I was looking at it when i bought mine @McScooterson
[1:10:35] invisiblematter: instructions unclear, joined a monkhood
[1:10:36] macydoes_: @perkolate  I think you can if you change it to Blizzard balance
[1:10:42] Aumora: I turn 31 next week and I'm going back to school for programming in January! :)
[1:10:50] velocibadger: @exalted1715 two
[1:10:51] McScooterson: @Aumora grats!
[1:10:58] Burritosalad: that murloc bodybuilder mount is great
[1:11:06] Librarian21London: (Lion taming is a Monty Python sketch. I am old.)
[1:11:09] Ujai321: you can't buy 6 month subs with balance, at least that was the case until recently
[1:11:23] Ujai321: and I would be shocked of they changed that
[1:11:32] Doomhauer: If I switch to the 12-month sub for the mount can I just switch back immediately?
[1:11:37] Sacrenos: @Aumora I'm almost 33 and about to leave programming myself behind to coach teams Good luck!
[1:11:39] Aumora: @McScooterson thank you! I'm nervous because it's been so long but excited as well
[1:11:51] nulian: Getting talents while leveling is best thing of that system makes leveling feel so much better
[1:12:00] Sunabubus: second pet is so annoying, you can't click on anything because you keep clicking on damn pets
[1:12:01] m4keyourself: Twitch drops for viewers are automatic as long as your bnet account is linked, right? Or is there a setting you actually need to click?
[1:12:14] tyrygosa13: $155
[1:12:16] macydoes_: Do you have a mount farm you’re currently interested in?
[1:12:19] Hitmonjeff: I know you played a little bit of the dark souls series, have you played elden ring at all?
[1:12:25] m4keyourself: I have drops for LoL and New World, but I don't remember actually clicking enable after linking accounts
[1:12:27] IanSabrewolfe: They changed it a while back.  You have to SUBSCRIBE to the 6/12 month to get the mounts.  Just buying it with Blizz balance to get them.
[1:12:27] Otterly_Bored: @Burritosalad "Murloc bodybuilder mount"? Love your description xD
[1:12:30] Ujai321: it should be automatic if accounts are linked
[1:12:31] barli13: Just curious bc I'd must rather spend 2m gold than like $200
[1:12:40] Aumora: @Sacrenos thank you!
[1:12:41] exalted1715: yay you ahve unlocked a kick
[1:12:48] m4keyourself: ty :)
[1:12:51] Sunabubus: I had 2 elegons on my main hunter prepatch day, literally couldn't click on anything (herb, mining nodes, clickable object), one of my pets was always sideways in the way
[1:12:51] IanSabrewolfe: Just using Blizz balance does not work.
[1:12:57] kicksagain: watched you on fishing with crendor last night, lots of fun to listen to!
[1:13:08] m4keyourself: gotcha okay cool
[1:13:11] DylanFalleMusic: did you level a DK in classic wotlk for the mount?
[1:13:13] Burritosalad: @otterly_bored feenEHEHEH
[1:13:24] KushDaddy03: are u part of the drops? kinda confused on who I watch lmao
[1:13:31] cardfrek: hazelWave hazelWave
[1:13:32] McScooterson: PSA re linking as well: If you've changed a password recently it can take a week for things to connect properly again
[1:13:32] Sacrenos: IT teams ;) COVID destroyed my brain to the point that I know technically how to program, but I am completely unable to keep complex systems in my head anymore.
[1:13:34] jamie_lee: What if you just recently paid the 6 month sub <cry face>
[1:13:55] Hoddgins: sweet ride
[1:13:58] Ujai321: this murloc is absolutely ridiculous btw
[1:14:05] Ujai321: does it fly?
[1:14:15] rohdey: Isn’t there a vehicle for this quest?
[1:14:39] ElroenFlyrow: @HazelNuttyGames So after the alts purge, how much total do you plan to have at the end? :P
[1:14:42] cardfrek: i'm subbed up to Feb 2024 now hazelTen hazelTen
[1:14:42] macydoes_: IT FLOATS IN WATER? Mom im scared
[1:14:54] Raaeni: i was 9 days away from renewable when i did the 12 month
[1:14:55] Burritosalad: PogChamp
[1:14:55] Ujai321: I remember there being a thing to get to the island, and doing it wrong
[1:14:57] emilysbuffs: yeahh i just paid my 6 months bruhhh
[1:15:03] pseudobudo: that looks so much better when you're standing on water
[1:15:06] thepikkle: I switched to the 1 year and had banked time until Feb. Didn't get charged - it just says I'll be charged a year in Feb
[1:15:11] Sunabubus: its just this walkable water they kept talking about
[1:15:16] etherealbeluga: I love that mount so much. Thinking about getting it for Christmas!
[1:15:45] Doomhauer: Everyone likes the giant murloc, but I like the scarab
[1:15:48] KushDaddy03: can I watch you for wow drops?
[1:15:55] IanSabrewolfe: The 12 month sub promotion lasts until Jan 15, so you have time.
[1:15:57] TotallyNotRaien: it would be so much better if it was a dozen murlocs carrying you around
[1:15:58] Ryok: i wish they would've kept it 6 months yagaSad 132€ is just WAY too much for me
[1:16:07] Ysarahhh: @KushDaddy03 theyre not til the 15th
[1:16:13] TheWeepingBadger: I just got back into WoW, trying to unlock zandalari trolls :D might do a 1 year sub after this sub from teh preorder is done
[1:16:14] Cyberwolffe: My 6 month sub renewed back in September and I bought the 12 month sub yesterday so now I don't have to pay my WoW sub again until march of 2024
[1:16:20] Teikure: i love the beetle mount, got the deal today
[1:16:21] azalgames: I've leveled through here several times recently. there's no vehicle. you water walk across, and get flown back
[1:16:22] Phyreflys: i already have a ticket open for not getting game time from preorder. im too nervous to pay for a yearly sub even though i want to
[1:16:22] superchief86: hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[1:16:23] DeWumpus: @thepikkle You should prob check again. My 6 month was supposed to renew in Jan 2023. Once I changed it to 12 month, I got charged the full amount and my next renewal is in Jan 2024 now
[1:16:24] Baphomet3: what do you think about the year incitive BEFORE the major content release?
[1:16:25] beaconhills07: sweet catto
[1:16:25] Ujai321: fun? on my twitch stream?
[1:16:29] m4keyourself: pretend not to look!
[1:16:36] sirjus: The one thing I don't like is that they're giving us 2 mounts we probably wont use 90% of the time in dragonflight because of dragonriding. Knowing myself, I'll probably buy it by christmas :D
[1:16:43] TheNoidd: I thought that was a litter box and was slightly alarmed about what we were zooming in on lol
[1:16:44] emilysbuffs: CAT CAM
[1:16:45] vikutoru11: I have the 6mo subscription active, am I gonna the mounts next 6mo?
[1:16:52] Ujai321: maybe a !drops command explaining how that is going to work could be a thing
[1:17:06] Cainnar: distracted by cat
[1:17:06] onegunpete: onegunpete subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey! My DF collector's edition arrived today, it's shiny!
[1:17:06] Streamlabs: onegunpete just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:17:06] macydoes_: Off topic but have you listened to Midnights already 🤣
[1:17:32] Parazetamol91: to be fair: those people will probably mute and go to another tab
[1:17:32] slumberdore: well there's lots of other streams to choose from. they don't have to watch you
[1:17:34] Ujai321: you mean to tell me I have 500k points worth nothing??? I'm leaving
[1:17:35] beaconhills07: fair to say those of us here truly want to be
[1:17:36] Burritosalad: its fine they will just mute u
[1:17:36] badak531: I know the year sub is cheaper than monthly but the sticker shoxk is hitting hard  :/
[1:17:39] DaDamzz: What addon for nameplates do you have for the enemies? OWL2019Tracer
[1:17:43] matchstickandlilly: They can just mute and afk out for 4 hours, don't worry about it Hazel
[1:17:45] cashthb: then they just watch some1 else
[1:17:47] KushDaddy03: I want to watch but I want the mount too 🤣
[1:17:51] McScooterson: !addons
[1:17:51] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:17:58] MishaVozduh: well if someone only wants the mount they can still pick a streamer they prefer
[1:18:01] lawzeck: thats one problem with the drops ppl dont watch you they just want the stuff its quite sad
[1:18:08] m4keyourself: I mean, AnnieFuchsia has put !drops in her stream title ever since the announcement which is a little... ehhh
[1:18:16] IanSabrewolfe: But I DO need to be here!  I need my Hazel fix to get though the day!
[1:18:18] tyrygosa13: I'm still waiting for  mine
[1:18:21] pseudobudo: hazelLurk_SQ what? channel points are 100% worth it
[1:18:27] Ujai321: you don't know your numbers anyway
[1:18:27] azalgames: omg I didn't know you could run passed them...
[1:18:35] Swordman117: What do you mean inflated numbers? Theres like 12 people here :)
[1:18:38] m4keyourself: publicity
[1:18:48] m4keyourself: advertisement - pretty smart, actually
[1:18:48] Doomhauer: I want people to like me for me BibleThump
[1:18:48] fugwenna: I wish they would bring back the old aspect of the cheetah from classic, especially now that I don't have soulshape anymore to cruise around where I can't mount
[1:18:55] MishaVozduh: glass half full. A bunch of people will find a streamer they like
[1:18:55] Cainnar: half of us are here for Kira anyway DxCat
[1:19:01] superchief86: just remember it's going to go towards your dream home
[1:19:03] gopher_1999: What about those of us here mainly for the kitty? :)
[1:19:06] Tokkoujo: Coming back to WoW after some years away but struggling on class selection
[1:19:19] macydoes_: I did that for heroes of the storm haha
[1:19:25] Varezhka8: they won't be in the chat anyway, just don't look at your view count :0
[1:19:34] yarema_on: The real question is do you have to watch other streams as a streamer to get the rewards?
[1:19:34] Jollywhompus: Not many is going to sit on yours honestly for just a mount, feel like they will just go to the pg 1 asmongold or whoever
[1:19:35] janahita: also the mods here are amazing, we should be in good hands
[1:19:35] Yinello: @Tokkoujo Druid and Monk are both very fun
[1:19:37] ctsuraun: if you play a gnome they grab you by your noggin in this scene
[1:19:47] kahuna1212: WOW hot tub stream lololol
[1:19:52] fiftymcnasty: The conversion rates are probably low, but not 0.
[1:19:56] DeWumpus: @Tokkoujo wait till Drakthyr realeases and try it out?
[1:20:01] badak531: I don't watch streams, I listen to them at work :P
[1:20:03] KuromiBlackheart: kitty <3
[1:20:04] xRedd7: Cub in the cubby hole
[1:20:06] Sacrenos: @Tokkoujo I always mained Tankadin and shadow priest. I started playing again to prepare for DF maining a destro lock and I have been loving it.
[1:20:08] invisiblematter: marketing surprises me, I expect it's a good deal for everyone involved, except people who bought the feldrake already
[1:20:20] macydoes_: Mom privacy please hazelLurk hazelLurk
[1:20:49] Tokkoujo: @Yinello Thanks, I was leaning towards Outlaw Rogue since I've never played but wanting a class that is solid in solo and old world farm
[1:20:53] TotallyNotRaien: do pets from promotions like blizzcon appear on the bmah?
[1:21:13] Ujai321: I haven't linked my twitch and bnet yet. I just don't care about collecting in wow that much
[1:21:19] m4keyourself: YES
[1:21:26] Ujai321: but I might now, who is to say
[1:21:32] Ryok: people will always complain sadly D:
[1:21:32] shjfty: wow players are the most difficult people to please
[1:21:36] Yinello: @Tokkoujo Personally I'd go for warrior or hunter then, because they can use  the most weapons which helps transmog collections
[1:21:36] azalgames: the rarity vs pixel hogging arguments are 🔥
[1:21:39] DaDamzz: What mouse do you use for WoW? :) wanting to buy a new mouse for ages but not sure which to pick for MMOs BloodTrail
[1:21:41] Tokkoujo: @DeWumpus Playing one for sure, but itching to play now so hoping to take advantage of the 50% while leveling
[1:21:45] zygav99: what chromie time hazel is this guys ?
[1:22:00] suddenlymoo: As someone who didnt have it.. Im still annoyed that nothing can be longterm valuable and feel "worth", that should be the cosmetic area no?
[1:22:01] JasperCalico: she's not in chromie time
[1:22:02] AngryTastyPastry: What kind of fishies did you have hazel? :D
[1:22:14] Streaming_Things: I feel like this is different because its a giveaway and not ppl just being able to do the content to get it.
[1:22:23] macydoes_: Do you have an addon to track rares in the area?
[1:22:36] Rigelhoof: Meeses.
[1:22:37] TotallyNotRaien: @suddenlymoo why does your enjoyment of something reliant on what other people do or have
[1:22:41] slumberdore: i tried that mouse but my hands are too small :(
[1:22:44] Sacrenos: The G600 is so unavailable in europe :( Mine came from the states via someone's suitcase...
[1:22:45] Ujai321: tiny micy?
[1:22:45] Aumora: Love my logitech g600! 2nd fave would be the naga. I liked the corsair scimitar BUT mine kept breaking.
[1:22:47] Tokkoujo: @Sacrenos I was Shadow as well, saw they've changed SO MUCH since years past
[1:22:57] TheWeepingBadger: Omg same, I need one now. I have giant hands and my razer is so smalll
[1:23:00] Aumora: I've had my g600 for a while now and no issues
[1:23:06] kimbjohn: hear hear. i went to the G600 and haven't looked back.
[1:23:28] Phyreflys: theres a LOT of mounts you have to put work into, not just the ones you pay massive amounts of real money for
[1:23:30] janahita: didn't they do a TCG pet last anniversary?
[1:23:40] azalgames: recently discovered ExtraQuestButton addon. makes these quest buttons like an extra action button
[1:23:49] Sacrenos: @Tokkoujo shadow isn't my shadow anymore, I loved it in wotlk and cata, loved the mobility, raided with it a lot. The current state of shadow priest is just an overly complex affliction lock
[1:23:49] suddenlymoo: @TotallyNotRaien Check ebay in a month and see if people still pay $3500 for it.. Dont have to go to myself :)
[1:23:55] JasperCalico: You should get cosmetics bc you like the cosmetic qtsShrug
[1:24:05] Tokkoujo: @Yinello I do love the Warrior play style, Fury seems fun right now. Charge and Heroic Leap are a blast
[1:24:08] Aumora: @WeepingxxBadger as someone who has used the 3 big ones, I'd say the corsair scimitar is the biggest. not sure if they've improved the build quality though, that was my issue with them
[1:24:14] IanSabrewolfe: There is a big difference between stuff like the TCG mounts and stuff that is still in-game, though.
[1:24:17] TheGaymerBear: I would have loved the chicken if id had to have been a TCG mount xD
[1:24:33] Ujai321: did you go over your free days already?
[1:24:33] TheNoidd: I think TCG mounts being a thing was a mistake in general, so I think anything obtainable for the game should be obtainable IN the game. Make it rare...do something but don't tie it to physical supply and demand
[1:24:36] TotallyNotRaien: @suddenlymoo not sure what point youre trying to make
[1:25:07] janahita: at this point though it's been many many years of prestige for the TCG stuff
[1:25:07] jeffdmk: You dont think a multi billion dollar cooperation would put invincible on the store to boost 4th quarter profits? I hope you are right
[1:25:15] Ujai321: learning from last week, I see
[1:25:15] suddenlymoo: I dont care about cosmetics to begin with, so I cant answer your question. But I know what I said is true for some people
[1:25:27] DaDamzz: For everyone that has g600 does it have a wireless version?
[1:25:37] badak531: well if blizzard wanted they could give out some tcg mounts as a prime gaming thing although i can see that angering some people
[1:25:47] m4keyourself: hows the wormies
[1:25:47] Sacrenos: @DaDamzz nope
[1:25:49] Raogrimm: got to level up
[1:25:51] PoodleMuffins: Hey chat & hazel! I plan on coming back for dragonflight and am unsure if I should resub now to prepare or just wait til like a day or two before release? Will I be missing anything if I dont sub now?
[1:25:52] Marmoh: Fishing feels like being alone with my thoughts for a prolonged period of time and that's a no no lol
[1:26:03] Ujai321: rather stay extra dry than not dry enough
[1:26:12] GrumpyTV: Stormwind and its raining, nothing better
[1:26:14] Sacrenos: @Marmoh mood
[1:26:17] yarema_on: Have you ever cooked a fish soup from the fish you caught?
[1:26:18] TotallyNotRaien: hope they put that spectral tiger mount on the 3 months sub just to rub salt on the wound
[1:26:19] JasperCalico: @PoodleMuffins pre order DF so you can play envoker on the 15th
[1:26:23] Ujai321: anything for Halloween, except fishing?
[1:26:25] TheWeepingBadger: Love fishing, I hunt predators mostly
[1:26:33] vadermug: good excuse to enjoy nature
[1:26:42] DaDamzz: @sacrenos thanks. Wanted to have a wireless mouse, sometimes i get annoyed with the wire and sometimes the cat trips on it LOL
[1:26:58] suddenlymoo: @TotallyNotRaien from what I understand, that one was already screwed due to duping
[1:27:04] mothwhowearslippers: What was that mount? Is that murloc?
[1:27:08] Phyreflys: @PoodleMuffins id wait until the 15th. there is almost nothing to do right now
[1:27:10] barli13: 175 attempts on Gieger and he is being extremely rude...he knows that's the last covenant mount I need >.<
[1:27:14] Sacrenos: @DaDamzz maybe the razer naga pro?
[1:27:28] mackerel01_: i would buy the 12 month sub but i cant afford it
[1:27:33] Ryok: @cuculliachamomillae yes it's brand new, you get it from a 12 month sub bundle
[1:27:46] Ryok: @mackerel01_ same yagaSad
[1:27:46] GrumpyTV: 20 vs 20 Evoker pvp
[1:28:00] Ujai321: but if
[1:28:02] suddenlymoo: You can already make your Sneaky Stabby Tauren though :)
[1:28:10] honeybun_games: i'm determined to get the 500 otter mount.... currently 256...
[1:28:10] mothwhowearslippers: @Ryok Only murloc mount ant it's 12 months sub :(
[1:28:12] TheWeepingBadger: I need a max zandalari druid... just started horde yesterday
[1:28:19] Otterly_Bored: Aww, the mass-worgen-killing breaks my heart D: Hazel! Why?
[1:28:34] DaDamzz: @sacrenos was thinking about that but isnt it a bit smaller? My hands are quite big as well. Saw th g604 too. But its not rechargable and needs replacement batteries. Any thoughts?
[1:28:38] mackerel01_: @WeepingxxBadger screw the horde up the alliance
[1:28:44] Ujai321: bit if a theoretical question, but would you do an ad for the cash shop if blizzard wanted you to? paid, of course
[1:28:45] Ryok: @cuculliachamomillae yeah i'm sad about it as well since i can't afford it yagaSad murlocs are my favorite race
[1:28:50] NRQ_x: when i chose enha shaman as a main they nerfed it lol
[1:28:58] superchief86: @honeybun_tv it's a great mount
[1:29:07] helgsixtyninemeowbutt: Is that a murloc mount?
[1:29:11] moa285: It's nostalgic to see you questing in Silverpine Forest. The first stream I watched was when you were there with your vulpera hunter. <3
[1:29:17] Riku1839: did you see the 2nd chapter of the DF legacies?
[1:29:28] IanSabrewolfe: Why Worgen massacre?  Because MMO murderhobos will do anything for XP and gold!
[1:29:35] GrumpyTV: Are you waiting until they are all out?
[1:29:43] mackerel01_: are you enabling drops for the twitch drop things in wow hazel?
[1:29:51] pand4craft: I enjoyed it, looked nice
[1:29:51] Sacrenos: @DaDamzz I personally only ever used 1 razer mouse, and they are rather slim in my opinion. I have no experience with the G604, I did see it, and in my experience, mice with replacable batteries EAT them.
[1:29:53] superchief86: sell out. it's cool
[1:29:57] yarema_on: Just Finished a set at the gym and though “oh, I should return the gym quest” 🥲😅
[1:29:59] mothwhowearslippers: @Ryok I feel you hahaha
[1:30:29] GrumpyTV: The 2nd ep was REALLY good
[1:30:35] GrumpyTV: You may dig the 2nd one
[1:30:46] mackerel01_: WAIT
[1:30:47] mackerel01_: CAT CAM
[1:30:50] Ujai321: fair enough. it is an analogue question about something happening in another hobby
[1:30:53] mackerel01_: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:30:58] IanSabrewolfe: @Sacrenos You should look at the Corsair Ironclaw.  Fantastic mouse for larger hands.
[1:31:09] DaDamzz: My thoughts exactly and they arent “environmentally friendly” as well. Thanks! Will be looking out for the Naga Pro and see if i can adjust to it :)
[1:31:38] DeveKr: Hazel: Open your bag please so we can see where it is placed. I cant figure out why mine is sucked up to the far right of the screen and how others are doing it.
[1:31:38] gorkamorka41782: Cheer100 Oh hey look. It's the streamer we're all going to be donating subs to for the Icabod pet when drops start! Also, saw you mentioned a lot in the Blue post about drops as a lot of people's favorite WoW Twitch streamer.
[1:31:39] Streamlabs: gorkamorka41782 has cheered 100 bits!
[1:32:03] mage_belldan: How about the next new Hobby for Hazel goes crazy for to be Skeet and Trap Shooting?
[1:32:18] mackerel01_: its the best goddarn thing ive seen all day
[1:32:20] Sacrenos: @IanSabrewolfe ow looks nice. I currently use a G600 for wow and an MX Master 3 for productivity, but the corsair looks like a comfy mouse
[1:32:20] Ujai321: did you take a break today already btw?
[1:32:54] cashthb: it's not.. and bas overlap with the right action bars
[1:32:56] SlaneQue: Shotting clay pigeons on the range
[1:32:59] DeveKr: Im seeing other streamers showing it to the left of the side bar (left) and I cant figure it out. THANK YOU! :)
[1:33:03] cashthb: *bags
[1:33:14] mothwhowearslippers: Even mount has special summon
[1:33:15] mackerel01_: gun stream????????
[1:33:18] superchief86: ooh, what about archery?
[1:33:22] dammittdannyy: Hi Hazel! No Crinkle today?
[1:33:32] dpb67: they don't resemble the animal in any way LUL not sure where the name comes from
[1:33:36] cypher128: My first job was to load clay pigeons... it was dangerous.
[1:33:41] SerabeanOfficial: The ad break over Hazel talking about content creators deciding how to make money is perfect timing >(
[1:33:46] white_catz: i thought ur streams used to start at 10, am i wrong? but now its 9?
[1:33:47] mage_belldan: They are like little round discs
[1:33:47] r3parker: it's just a clay disc that is shot out from a device so it's moving
[1:33:49] handsomeboat: its where you just go shooting dishes in a field
[1:33:49] kimbjohn: They're just discs.
[1:33:53] yarema_on: “I don’t plan on shooting something” while literally shooting a worgen
[1:33:54] dreadd39: someone say guns?! KKona Yee Yee
[1:34:02] IanSabrewolfe: Clay pidgeons are the tiny clay frisbees they shoot with shotguns for target practice.
[1:34:03] Parazetamol91: exactly but made of clay instead of wool LUL
[1:34:18] Ujai321: winter time @white_catz
[1:34:29] yurpally: I was wondering if we can put our 50s back in Chromie time.
[1:34:36] Robin_src: why do you level to 50 and not 60
[1:34:37] exalted1715: snippy needs a knoife
[1:34:42] exalted1715: toy
[1:34:42] Ujai321: your time changes this weekend, right?
[1:34:49] yurpally: I hope so, I have 3 just hanging out to be leveled
[1:34:56] AnabolaSWE: @HazelNuttyGames  What do you pick on chromie time to go through thouse old zoned that you are leveling in right now?
[1:35:01] mackerel01_: its already changed here in ireland
[1:35:02] Ujai321: everyone is annoyed by it
[1:35:05] HOLDINtheACES: saaaaaame
[1:35:11] HOLDINtheACES: DLS is the worst
[1:35:13] handsomeboat: can someone please explain how the twitch drops are gonna work?
[1:35:13] bitepop: im lvling a bunch to 50 too! can't wait to chromie time 50-60
[1:35:16] mage_belldan: This is why I said Skeet and Trap shooting so no animals are harmed
[1:35:18] Nymus89: Darkness at 4:30 :(
[1:35:19] NRQ_x: what class do you recommend to boost with my dragonflight lvl boost ?
[1:35:19] pseudobudo: morning people are the worst, stealing daylight from us night owls
[1:35:25] bitepop: also Drustvar is such a fun lvling zone
[1:35:27] kimbjohn: same. by the time I get home at the end of the day, it's dark. I hate that.
[1:35:28] Nymus89: Yeah everyone needs to agree
[1:35:28] Ryok: germany has been talking about getting rid of the timechange for like 20 years D:
[1:35:30] superchief86: wait, so will stream be later or earlier?
[1:35:31] Hitmonjeff: think this is the last year we are doing the time change
[1:35:31] HOLDINtheACES: i think AZ already doesn't do it
[1:35:38] Ujai321: it already changed in eu, hence the question. na is always a week later
[1:35:44] Nymus89: Same with here in Ontario, we need New York to go with it apparently
[1:35:47] exsalsiorr: @HOLDINtheACES can confirm, i live there
[1:35:57] Ujai321: so most people missed an hour today^^
[1:35:57] TheWeepingBadger: I am sad berta didnt vote to get rid of Daylight savings time
[1:36:02] honeybun_games: it was so dark last night i was ready for bed at 6:15 pm lmao
[1:36:05] AreYou5erious: more sun hours with "winter time" than the summer time
[1:36:08] nabilstendardo: I levelled a rogue through Terokkar Forest for getting loremaster for that zone... wow that zone sucks
[1:36:10] r3parker: winter time is the actual time though, summer time is the wrong time
[1:36:18] azalgames: what will be the best 50-60 paths post xp nerf?
[1:36:32] HOLDINtheACES: @AreYou5erious it's the same number of sun hours....
[1:36:37] handsomeboat: The wrong time for everything
[1:36:39] mackerel01_: winter for weather summer for getting off school
[1:36:49] Ryok: @nabilstendardo as much as i love TBC zones the leveling experience is horrible xD
[1:37:00] Perkolate: LUL
[1:37:06] Ujai321: lunar eclipse is just very dark
[1:37:12] mackerel01_: ok guys

[1:37:37] calllmewilliam: poggers
[1:37:39] vadermug: witch confirmed
[1:37:41] honeybun_games: hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[1:37:48] Octopixy1971: @eiaed hazelWave
[1:38:33] IanSabrewolfe: Convex, not concave.
[1:38:37] Ujai321: stab someone with the moon?
[1:38:38] mackerel01_: hazel why are you thinking about stabbing people with the moon?
[1:38:39] handsomeboat: "Like you could stab someone with it"
[1:38:44] Vaynor22: @raggiemeh Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:38:46] exalted1715: math is hard
[1:38:54] Parazetamol91: concave is like a cave
[1:39:02] rikytikytavy02: could you by chance point me to how to disable blizzard art bar for new UI?
[1:39:02] IanSabrewolfe: Yup.  Vex is out, cave is in.
[1:39:07] lazytitanex: hey @HazelNuttyGames , greetings, have u choose ur main?
[1:39:08] hemsath1: Remember that gibbous is bulging like it’s 2 b’s. Round shape b
[1:39:10] Ujai321: math is hard, surprises are fun
[1:39:19] handsomeboat: As an astronomer, I can confirm all of what has been said
[1:39:25] Ujai321: it makes me happy you still have that in your mind
[1:39:28] superchief86: 2/6 on wordle!
[1:39:45] SerabeanOfficial: A crescent moon would be both concave and convex depending on which side you’re referring to
[1:39:48] DaDamzz: Been watching your Youtube vids everytime I come back to WOW first time seeing you on twitch! :) sending chill vibes all the way from the Philippines!! 🇵🇭
[1:39:57] hemsath1: It’s kind of reddish too, from the earth’s atmosphere bending light. It is the same red and same effect as late sunset
[1:39:58] yarema_on: “Surprises are fun” - a major throwback to pet charm farm/battlegrounds era 😭❤️
[1:39:58] rikytikytavy02: thank you!!!!
[1:40:21] TheWeepingBadger: The UI system is in beta basically haha hope they update it
[1:40:27] mackerel01_: i live on the east coast if ireland
[1:40:29] mackerel01_: gotta SAY
[1:40:31] mackerel01_: oops caps
[1:40:36] TotallyNotRaien: conditionally smart
[1:40:41] ctsuraun: Oh yeah, tides are wild
[1:40:46] bitepop: I have a new appreciation for BoA, forgot how fun lvling here is!
[1:40:46] Ztratoz: do you know how to get that Raid worldmarkers window aktive in a m+ example? or have they removed it?
[1:40:47] mackerel01_: but i notice no differance
[1:40:54] superchief86: time for sleep. bye everyone! 👋
[1:40:57] janahita: I wish the moon was regenerative cheese stock
[1:41:00] TotallyNotRaien: the moon controls the water levels, high tide and low tide
[1:41:02] hemsath1: Tides are just sloshing and they’re very odd
[1:41:07] bitepop: Chromie time is literally the best new feature in the game fight me
[1:41:10] Potoo_of_Paradise: moon make sea lumpy
[1:41:15] jeffdmk: how does the person that made the bar art feel that the first question everyone asks whenever the ui changes is how do i get rid of this art
[1:41:17] Doomhauer: I play Warcraft, I only understand the Tides of Darkness
[1:41:21] vadermug: gravity op
[1:41:40] xRedd7: i can never get good sleep on Full moons, family makes fun of me and calls me a werewolf
[1:41:45] TheWeepingBadger: Smarts is 100% effort driven
[1:41:49] Exedol_85: lol pay 1 yeas for this xD
[1:41:50] TotallyNotRaien: @jeffdmk probably the same as the person who writes the quest text
[1:41:59] WoubbieTheBlankie: I watch a lot of politics; there are PLENTY of dumb people out there.
[1:42:12] Nymus89: lol
[1:42:21] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: Surprised you dont have all alts already level 60
[1:42:27] suddenlymoo: Mistaking dumb for uninformed, and I guess the opposite is probably common :)
[1:43:04] ctsuraun: Yep but like why there are two tide cycles per day and that they are different heights, and that when the tide 1 cycle is rising the tide 2 cycle is falling it's super weird
[1:43:07] Ujai321: I had a teacher once that said: "I used to think no person is stupid, they just need another way to learn. after 20 years, I know I was wrong." harrowing to hear that
[1:43:16] TotallyNotRaien: yeah chromie time is hands down the #1 feature ever added
[1:43:17] IanSabrewolfe: Tides are weird because the moon's orbit isn't perfectly round and because the sun gets involved, too.
[1:43:33] mackerel01_: trying to download a game and i have 73 gigs left at 30kb a second
[1:44:11] IanSabrewolfe: @mackerel01_ Ouch.
[1:44:21] white_catz: where r u leveling?
[1:44:26] nabilstendardo: presumably the variability in distance of the moon to the earth, which is not constant, can give different strength of tides
[1:44:28] HUHchill: true true
[1:44:31] lazytitanex: have u ever suffer from anxiety? if so any recomendation?
[1:44:31] WoubbieTheBlankie: Dunning Kruger is a real thing.
[1:44:38] mackerel01_: @mackerel01_ even worse is i have gigabit internet
[1:44:44] handsomeboat: The tides are (at least partially) dependent on the distance between us and the moon. Due to Newton's third law, just as the earth pulls on the moon, the moon also pulls on the earth. As such, tidal forces aren't something exclusive to the water, it's just that we see it easier with the water of earth
[1:44:55] jellyjim_: I have a short attention span, because of this I had difficult learning at school
[1:44:56] mackerel01_: @lazytitanex every second of every day
[1:44:57] invisiblematter: therapy helped me
[1:44:57] TotallyNotRaien: get a psychiatrist and get on meds
[1:45:01] suddenlymoo: If more people could get that far down that train of thought.. We'd have bettered society alot >.< Good take
[1:45:05] cashthb: alcolhol is great
[1:45:10] exalted1715: whiskey works pretty good
[1:45:19] jellyjim_: but when I first focus I understand what I am learning when I focus enough and use much time on it
[1:45:21] Karilypipers: re: anxiety...found out "safe socks" here the other day...gonna steal that
[1:45:22] mackerel01_: @cashthb alcoolhol?
[1:45:29] DMac9_: is the new mount available on retail?
[1:46:03] AJ_Zen: In Europe and some European countries they call depression and anxiety American or western disease
[1:46:04] mackerel01_: @DMac9_ shes playing on retail
[1:46:07] jeffdmk: My advice is there may be better places to get advice then some person on twitch
[1:46:33] DMac9_: @DMac9_ ty
[1:46:33] Varaey: what do you think of the new ui and talents? How do they go with leveling?
[1:46:34] raggiemeh: when I feel anxious, literally saying f
[1:46:55] fuzzyio: This applies for shortterm stress
[1:47:05] TheDuelLogs: relatable
[1:47:07] raggiemeh: "future raggiemeh's problem" helps
[1:47:13] mackerel01_: hazel im asthmatic CURE IT
[1:47:35] Guardian_Actual: @HazelNuttyGames can you show how to bring up the xp bar can't seem to find it
[1:47:39] hemsath1: Hey Hazel, I have this odd rash…
[1:47:42] TotallyNotRaien: @mackerel01_ just breathe damn
[1:47:47] Ujai321: is that a full speed murloc already?
[1:47:48] MintChocolateThins: do you have to be 12 month subbed in classic to get the mount? or can you get it from 12 month sub on retail
[1:47:50] janahita: people deal with anxiety in various different ways, but talking about it helps de-stigmatise it
[1:47:51] Robin_src: un ilife
[1:47:51] exalted1715: @hemsath1  lol
[1:47:53] Robin_src: uni life
[1:48:09] Varaey: yeah, it feel weird where some of my abilites are now gone and I cannot obtain them all again
[1:48:14] SlurpeeBurglar: @MintChocolateThins your subscriptions goes towards both
[1:48:15] nabilstendardo: is the 12-month sub significatly cheaper than the 6-month one (regardless of the mounts)?
[1:48:22] pand4craft: we should go get 100% speed hazel
[1:48:35] AJ_Zen: How do people have time to be depressed and stressed out XD XD
[1:48:43] Oopswait: Cat loaf peepoLove
[1:48:48] mackerel01_: @mackerel01_ god da,m why didnt i think of that?
[1:48:54] hemsath1: Professional mental health folks, with it but also remember that if your therapist isn’t a good fit, isn’t working for you, you can change no harm no foul
[1:48:56] Doomhauer: If you're max level, the XP bar goes away
[1:49:01] suddenlymoo: That will still ruin you in a few years, but yeah.. I dont think you get around that if someone with power over you is actively trying
[1:49:01] jellyjim_: do you miss having a regular jobb? :D
[1:49:08] IanSabrewolfe: Really wish the base UI would let me move the XP bar.  So annoying it's locked.
[1:49:31] Marmoh: Classic is fun but it feels too temporary and futile
[1:49:45] mackerel01_: everythings free if you arent scared of prison
[1:50:23] m4keyourself: You're the most self-aware person I know of, I believe
[1:50:46] timekiller80: hey Hazel, got both mounts from the death advance paragon box :)
[1:51:07] McScooterson: @timekiller80 graaaats
[1:51:10] Ryok: i sinned and bought the 12 month sub even though i'll have trouble affording groceries towards the end of the month D:
[1:51:10] nabilstendardo: btw I just got Jaithys on my fury warrior, how many weapons should I feed it?
[1:51:13] white_catz: i prefer to escape my thoughts by making myself busy with gaming or social media lol
[1:51:19] anko_48: Hi everyone :D
[1:51:21] Yinello: I want to make a Horde priest, which race should I pick :D
[1:51:48] mackerel01_: @Yinello gnome
[1:51:52] Robin_src: The new click casting is pretty neat. Going to try and drop vuhdo this expasion
[1:51:56] honeybun_games: what's your favourite fishing story?
[1:51:58] WoubbieTheBlankie: I like this type of discussion!
[1:51:58] SimpinOnGinAndJuice: How do I cope with a 21% parse?
[1:51:59] janahita: any cool one pot recipe trials?
[1:51:59] Perkolate: Best fish you caught or almost caught?
[1:52:04] Ujai321: anything for Halloween, other than fishing?
[1:52:04] Yinello: horde gnome coming up
[1:52:06] handsomeboat: I've learned that there are three types of tidal patterns. Typically, places will have two high tides and two low tides in a lunar day. Some places only have one. If both high tides reach the same height AND both low tides reach the same 'lows' it's Semidiurnal. If the heights differ, the tides are Mixed-semidiurnal. If there's only one of each tide during the lunar day, then it's a diurnal tide. Sorry for the late addition LUL
[1:52:18] Teikure: my wife sews a lot, its not so cheap at mostly think :D
[1:52:21] ctsuraun: yep! Apparel manufacturing benefits a LOT from economies of scale
[1:52:22] lorewell: @Yinello goblin
[1:52:25] mayer2911: im having a real hard time in wow right now. i wanna level a lock and gather and skin stuff and just play for fun but my guild insist i level a shammy and gear up already for end raiding.... advice?
[1:52:30] WoubbieTheBlankie: Never buy fabric unless it's 50% off.
[1:52:49] djpep6: wrath classic is so boring
[1:52:51] thecasualcanuckgamer: hello, thats a cool mount
[1:52:53] Phyreflys: dont let people tell you what to play?
[1:52:55] djpep6: i am done with it
[1:53:00] djpep6: a waste of time
[1:53:00] suddenlymoo: or all of the above
[1:53:07] Riku1839: @nabilstendardo i think you feed it 4 weps.  i remember reading on wowhead 5 weps is a dps loss
[1:53:11] Ujai321: uh, do you enjoy "big monsters fighting each other" movies?
[1:53:17] Damomentt: @mayer2911 play what you want
[1:53:26] Glamrock_Bun: somehow waiting for the Dracthyr is maahh
[1:53:27] white_catz: yeah hazel ure right but im not there yet 😂
[1:53:29] Varaey: I feel that, I want to get into cosplay, but my only sewing experience is with Ballet shoes
[1:53:36] anko_48: What do you guys think about adding end game leveling zones to chromie time? Like Suramar, timeless isle, nazjatar? I think it would be neat to be able to go back to those zones for people who haven't done them during current content
[1:53:42] Glamrock_Bun: i done everything i want for this expansion
[1:54:01] Damomentt: @mayer2911 im sure if ur guild is chill then they should allow tht <3
[1:54:07] mackerel01_: goshdarnint hazel my mother doesnt like tea
[1:54:11] mackerel01_: i cant do that
[1:54:16] Glamrock_Bun: Godzilla is Better :D
[1:54:19] jellyjim_: do you still enjoy alcohol now and then?
[1:54:29] mayer2911: thanks guys! <3
[1:54:34] cashthb: pacific rim is not even big monsters fighting each other is about big robots fighting big monsters...
[1:54:46] Ujai321: what was it you enjoyed about Pacific Rim, if not the monster fights?
[1:54:50] regansets1: do you think farming iron docks is viable anymore?
[1:55:00] janahita: my new favorite sewing videos are the ones with thrifted fabrics, or thrifted sheets
[1:55:03] Teikure: a work collegue make cloth for her kids, but she buys cloth really cheap
[1:55:04] tim40361: hazelWave
[1:55:07] Glamrock_Bun: @cashthb Godzilla is Proper fighting
[1:55:26] nabilstendardo: @Yinello it depends on what you want from your race choice. If you want to play one of the new races that could only become priests in dragonflight (orc or highmountain tauren), it might be interesting. But regarding racial abilities, they are all pretty tame
[1:55:35] Alastrine: Any advice you wish someone gave you before you started streaming, I want to start streaming but now sure how to get started.
[1:55:37] morbeeus: Ding 23 HypeSwipe
[1:55:43] Ujai321: anyway, I watched Godzilla vs Kong yesterday, and that movie is absolutely fantastic (for what it is)
[1:55:48] Chaosicx: omg I'm catching a hazel stream live??
[1:55:53] timathach: what addon do you use to sell gray items?
[1:56:02] Ujai321: which is giant monster fighting each other
[1:56:03] Glamrock_Bun: @HazelNuttyGames do you think we get anything special for this anniversary
[1:56:03] suddenlymoo: Its possible making a thing that keeps your baby warm releases a good stream of mom hormones :)
[1:56:04] ctsuraun: Nice thing about sewing though, I have a body type that is incompatible with the styles of manufactured clothing I want to wear so I can alter things so they fit
[1:56:04] mackerel01_: HypePopcorn
[1:56:20] hemsath1: @timathach leatrix plus can do that, along with many other helpful things
[1:56:45] Parazetamol91: sowing is really the only cloth related skill that I am really interested in as a male human
[1:57:03] IanSabrewolfe: Godzilla is the One True Kaiju.  ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES!
[1:57:12] timathach: @hemsath1 thanks
[1:57:15] Coughing_Coffin: How did you get that Merloc mount?
[1:57:22] hemsath1: @parazetamol91 I’ve taught several guys to crochet and they loved making their own winter hats
[1:57:25] Glamrock_Bun: @IanSabrewolfe PRAISE THE MESSAGE!!
[1:57:40] Glamrock_Bun: All Hail to King G
[1:58:07] bitepop: agreed, drinking kind of sucks
[1:58:18] Parazetamol91: @hemsath1 I have a friend that needed to practice so I have 3 winter hats already LUL
[1:58:18] lazytitanex: whats ur best tea?  or favorite?
[1:58:27] SlaneQue: I'm a struggling alcoholic. Would love to start feeling that way about it
[1:58:38] cashthb: not drinking water while drinking alcohol is the greatest of mistakes
[1:58:56] lilmaurin: How many alts at 50+ you have, Hazel?
[1:59:04] hemsath1: @slaneque good thoughts your way
[1:59:08] Glamrock_Bun: im a Teaaholic, im addicted to Tea this Season makes it worse
[1:59:15] IanSabrewolfe: Leatrix Plus is an absolute MUST HAVE addon.  It handles so many little QoL things that just make the game better.
[1:59:16] Ujai321: not many
[1:59:17] rankaar: green tea and orange juice after party/drinking is the best :D
[1:59:28] Ujai321: most didn't survive The Incident
[1:59:28] Varaey: Most men are kind of shrugged away from Sewing. I only picked it up to get my ballet shoes done so my arches stopped hurting
[1:59:36] Ryok: @kennai__ not many anymore she deleted most of them recently i think there's like 5 or 6 left? merodyHmm
[1:59:45] Glamrock_Bun: Black Tea with Mil <3
[1:59:49] Glamrock_Bun: Milk
[1:59:56] Ryok: @kennai__ she has a video on youtube if you want to see the altageddon
[1:59:59] galaxymeow88: If you like cinnamon, Harney and Sons Tea makes a really nice hot cinnamon tea
[2:00:12] lazytitanex: trying to main on feral druid, what race u recommend on Alliance?
[2:00:27] Yinello: made a Tauren priest named Ricotta, I'm pleased :3
[2:00:31] SerabeanOfficial: How does one even start to learn to sew
[2:00:33] galaxymeow88: It is very strong
[2:00:33] Glamrock_Bun: Transfer to Horde
[2:00:35] lilmaurin: @Ryok Why she deleted? :c
[2:00:37] Glamrock_Bun: and your good :D
[2:00:41] Ujai321: did you put your nose in the tea
[2:00:42] mackerel01_: nelf
[2:00:45] harry_here: Is crinkle all grown up now? (60)
[2:00:50] Immortalizz02: @HazelNuttyGames Do you Play Wrath Classic at all?
[2:00:51] IanSabrewolfe: @Varaey Yeah, sewing, knitting, and crochet are all sadly lacking in male representation.
[2:00:57] Ujai321: because a nose in hot tea would make your nose burn
[2:00:59] Yinello: Worgen is great, good starting zone
[2:01:04] tim40361: hazelLove
[2:01:11] Glamrock_Bun: emm Hazel you know Crinkle is like let's say it nice
[2:01:13] Ryok: @kennai__ i'd recommend looking at the video for the answer she goes over the reason at the start of the video ^^
[2:01:14] Glamrock_Bun: a Fetish
[2:01:27] TotallyNotRaien: yeah i told her
[2:01:31] lazytitanex: yeah, i havent been wanting to level my druid in Shadowlands, so boring
[2:01:39] WhippWhapp: since the "rare resources" calling is up for a few days, very easy gold by clicking treasures in Mal, Arden and Rev! About 270 gold per click :) , and treasures spawn in every zone for the calling
[2:01:40] lilmaurin: @Ryok Thank you!
[2:01:46] white_catz: man the egg collecting is so nasty
[2:02:09] hectorian01: HI HAZEL I MISSED YOU
[2:02:14] Glamrock_Bun: Crinkle/Crinkeling is like wearing a Diaber as an Adult :I
[2:02:19] McScooterson: !wrath
[2:02:19] Streamlabs: Hazel has no current plans to play a meaningful amount of Wrath Classic.
[2:02:20] Ujai321: you avoided healing for a long time because it was a stereotype
[2:02:58] Ujai321: ok for real tho, do you have not weird dreams?
[2:03:07] IanSabrewolfe: Knitting is SO incredibly cathartic.  And you get useful stuff out of it.  How this isn't flooded with guys I will never understand.
[2:03:11] Immortalizz02: @HazelNuttyGames Why dont you like Classic wow and the classic expansions?
[2:03:17] Ujai321: because I don't
[2:03:22] lazytitanex: have u ever dream u r driving? and wake up feeling ur going to crash cuz u r sleep? lol
[2:03:33] Varaey: Oh, I agree. Ive been a professional Ballet dancer for a couple years now. Bulllying was rough as a kid but completely changed over the last set of years
[2:03:35] cashthb: or just download tinder?
[2:03:40] Glamrock_Bun: Classic is washed Up Content
[2:04:30] TotallyNotRaien: i was in sixth grade knitting pink and purple wool to make a sweater (cape) for my dog
[2:04:32] exalted1715: i think kira is exploring the space, its so cute to watch
[2:04:41] Glamrock_Bun: will there be a Legacies 2 Reaction?
[2:04:42] gammaraegames: having the confidence to put yourself into situations regardless of gender dynamics is very attractive
[2:04:45] Immortalizz02: @Glamrock_Bun Lmfao and retail is baby simualator
[2:04:56] Parazetamol91: Im 31 and have never dreamed about work but I dream about school weekly NotLikeThis
[2:05:00] exalted1715: whenever i dream , its me dying somehow. been like this for years
[2:05:02] Ryok: i have so many wierd dreams that i ended up writing them down and sharing with friends because they were so interesting xD
[2:05:04] galaxymeow88: My partner tells me my cat will meow in my face while I'm sleeping
[2:05:07] thewickedfate: if I dream about driving, my brakes never work
[2:05:13] Glamrock_Bun: sounds like LFR mentality immortal
[2:05:21] Myhtologist: hi
[2:05:24] white_catz: lol i have the same dreams as someone with no driving license
[2:05:33] IanSabrewolfe: @galaxymeow88 Tell them to get video.
[2:05:40] QUIXve: thanks for the vids... would be playing wow without your utube guides xD
[2:05:48] QUIXve: would not be*
[2:05:55] hectorian01: Ever thought about posting your streams on youtube or posting more frequent on youtube? i really love your videos and you personality
[2:06:20] Swazti: So What is Hazel's IRL Mount?
[2:06:23] Lilithesque: I've never had a driving license, but my recurring bad dream is that I'm driving my mum's car around and no one knows I still don't have a license - imposter syndrome dream ftw!
[2:06:32] Ryok: i tried dating apps and the only matches i got were bots PrideShrug i'll just stay single
[2:06:40] QUIXve: try ***
[2:06:44] BoundlessBruce: i met my wife on tinder but those were the early days of the platform years ago lol
[2:06:47] gradyb87: my gf and i have been together almost 3 years and we met on tinder
[2:06:51] nabilstendardo: I have had those dreams as well, and I am a 37-year old guy without a driving license (thankfully for the lives of others)
[2:07:03] Karilypipers: My son met a lady on Tinder, still together 2 years later.
[2:07:11] lazytitanex: do u go on dates with friends? just for fun?
[2:07:13] Its_JAFS: dungeon finder is the new tinder :D
[2:07:20] thewickedfate: if I were to find myself single again, I would just get more cats. I can't even imagine trying to date.
[2:07:22] BertTheFrenchy: I met my wife on WoW, and we've  been going 12 years strong :)
[2:07:24] d30xx: where do we get the TCG twitch drop for wow?
[2:07:26] harry_here: You have to be super deliberate on dating apps imo. People are quick to find someone else if your intentions differ
[2:07:30] im_capy: Met my fiance in wow classic
[2:07:34] lorddralnu: i know that i already asked this question but i didnt hear the answer if you did answer it. are you participating  in the wow twitch drops
[2:07:38] russopotomus: @thewickedfate Oof I have that one too sometimes, hate it

[2:07:49] Ujai321: that is such a good comparison actually
[2:07:52] PlayfulSlay: after your altageddon, I decided to do an addonaggedon after the new UI release. what addons do you still use?
[2:07:59] IanSabrewolfe: Bah, Tinder.  Meet your partner in your hobby space.  MUCH better.  Met my partner in EQ2 15 years ago and we are still madly in love.
[2:08:07] harry_here: The text chat is all about meeting people, you learn nothing
[2:08:11] hectorian01: Ever thought about posting your streams on youtube or posting more frequent on youtube? i really love your videos and you personality
[2:08:17] Ujai321: that is from 2009??!?
[2:08:18] harry_here: You have to meet irl
[2:08:27] Lilithesque: I met my forever person on Tumblr - can recommend over dating apps 😂
[2:08:35] Ujai321: I would have bet it was early 2000s at the latest
[2:08:51] iswordx: @immortalizz02 cause retail is better
[2:08:52] im_capy: wow is a dating app LUL
[2:08:55] Its_JAFS: lmao his name is dumass? xD great npc

[2:09:02] miloandthewhale: That' s not just any npc, that's Dumass.
[2:09:14] Sacrenos: I've been in a steady relationship for 12 years now, so no personal experience, but man, the stories I hear from friends about tinder are wild to me. some have flings, and some find love, both I get. What I dont get are the 'situationships' where basically you date and do couple stuff together, but both parties just.... dont communicate at all about boundaries and wishes? like, everything is a guessing game?
[2:09:23] Glamrock_Bun: is Gray Mog already in or still disabled
[2:09:31] Burritosalad: @HazelNuttyGames Jesus is all the addons i need
[2:09:42] PlayfulSlay: nice, I'll have to go back to this after and check out ones you have that I don't have, thanks girl 😀
[2:09:49] IanSabrewolfe: CROWS!!!!  Sorry, going on lurk.
[2:09:52] Glamrock_Bun: your kinde penetrant about that question
[2:09:53] hectorian01: Ever thought about posting your streams on youtube or posting more frequent on youtube? i really love your videos and you personality
[2:09:55] Sutekiii: oh bm hunter gets two pets baseline now?
[2:09:58] handsomeboat: Dating apps are a hellscape far worse than the american wild west

[2:10:02] Streamlabs: lilboofi just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:10:31] nabilstendardo: she uses whatever addon doesn't stop her from doing UI actions Kappa
[2:10:46] ctsuraun: yeah it's WAY better to be alone than miserable in a relationship
[2:11:03] Alastrine: me and my partner kind of just accidentally bumped into each other, to be honest I prefer that over having to present myself a certain way on a dating app compared to a real social experience in person than texting.
[2:11:08] hectorian01: Ever thought about posting your streams on youtube or posting more frequent on youtube? i really love your videos and you personality
[2:11:14] m4keyourself: I've made the decision to be alone for the past 10 years with my dogs and I'm extremely happy about that. Declined dates just because I'm happy with where I am
[2:11:21] Ujai321: she used to do that
[2:11:23] PlayfulSlay: you are a very strong woman, thanks for sharing these things. I know you don't talk about personal stuff very often.
[2:11:27] Benxsmith: Just got Invincible today after 180 tries, so happy :D
[2:11:29] Lilithesque: I was never afraid to be on my own, and kinda expected that I probably would be; but I think that meant when I did meet the person who's perfect for me, I knew it was right
[2:11:29] Sacrenos: yea, work on yourself on the one side, and be open about wishes and boundaries early and often while you are dating.
[2:11:31] mackerel01_: healing my first raid in LFR tonight
[2:11:32] Glamrock_Bun: im happy they changed Childrens week achievement this year
[2:11:32] Nymus89: It's also one of those things when you're not worried about it or actively seeking it out, things just happen. Go about your life and who knows who you may end up meeting
[2:11:34] mackerel01_: its going well
[2:11:40] Glamrock_Bun: got the mount after what 12 Years
[2:11:48] Excrump: it's hard to convince people about this

[2:11:51] Coughing_Coffin: It took me 192 kills to get it this year, I don’t think it’s increased
[2:12:00] Glamrock_Bun: the Long Journey one
[2:12:08] Alastrine: Finding some one who can accept that u need personal time and your own friends and hobbies is also big importance
[2:12:11] nevarea: dating? GO OUT IN THE WORLD! Iam 70 and its the best way to find  someone, and being alone can be great
[2:12:22] Ujai321: don't tell me your personal experiences alerted your opinions
[2:12:30] Zorevon: Why do all the cool kids play horde? I don’t like that my friends play Ally
[2:12:36] im_capy: there is always 2 sides to a coin
[2:12:44] Glamrock_Bun: @Coughing_Coffin i try since 2008 or 2009 to get the Ravenlord

[2:16:12] Excrump: would you continue doing streams in your retirement?
[2:16:14] Ryok: @BuckyDK as someone who drank a can of monster a day for 7 years and daily drank cheap energy drinks before that for about 9 years... stay away from energy drinks D:
[2:16:14] stephthebee: @hazelnuttygames how did you go about finding your tattoo artist? Following their work on instagram mostly?

[2:17:47] skepfps: wait is this a BM hunter?
[2:17:53] Glamrock_Bun: im curious about the Year of the Rabbit/Bunny Mount
[2:18:00] hectorian01: do you have another job besides streaming?
[2:18:05] SxeSarah: @Glamrock_Bun She's like 6 cats short of crazy.
[2:18:15] Glamrock_Bun: @DustinNKang Looks like it
[2:18:18] SlaneQue: It's very normal to do what you don't want in order to have what you do want.
[2:18:32] handsomeboat: Is the new mount John, Paul, George, or Ringo?
[2:18:35] Ryok: @BuckyDK and what did i get from it? insomnia and i'm losing 15 of my teeth this month at age 33 D:
[2:18:40] skepfps: wait there is a 12 month bundle? how did I miss it

[2:20:34] BuckyDK: Every time I close your streams I immediately forget who you are, weird cat gaming lady.
[2:20:38] TheDuelLogs: yeah that makes sense
[2:20:43] McScooterson: You could vtuber it
[2:21:01] stephthebee: I think it’s low stress but you still have to be ‘on’ for stream so I would say that’s stressful at least with my type of personality
[2:21:04] NotoriousDruid: EVERYBODY needs a day or two to their self, where they don't exist to the rest of the world. It's so energizing.
[2:21:05] mackerel01_: i learn lessons from the people who follow my advise
[2:21:12] SerabeanOfficial: Do you think it was important for you to show your face to gain popularity? If you could go back would you still reveal your face?

[2:23:16] IanSabrewolfe: Never understood why bass are so popular to fish for.  They don't taste all that great.
[2:23:19] McScooterson: @Perkolate Why would you wish one of those on someone?
[2:23:26] Octopixy1971: cutiepie Kira hazelTen
[2:23:41] McScooterson: @iDibby level to 50 and save 60 for when chromie gets extende
[2:23:46] SxeSarah: On Sunday, the anniversary starts and we will have that lvling buff on top of the 50% PLUS Darkmoon Faire is up for another 10% XP increase. I wonder how fast we can lvl with all of those.
[2:24:00] Ryok: @iDibby i'd say 50 now 60 when DF rolls around so you can chromie time the last levels unless you want the char for mission table
[2:24:21] JasperCalico: LOL

[2:24:39] hemsath1: All hail the glow cloud
[2:24:44] TheDuelLogs: I've heard lots of face cam streamers say they wished vtubing was a thing when they started
[2:24:49] McScooterson: @hemsath1 EXACTLY
[2:25:14] Steinhelm: what is v-tubing?
[2:25:20] ManderzBb: You sooo could.
[2:25:23] IanSabrewolfe: I am 100% here for the prime cloud content.
[2:25:26] Ryok: vtubing is the great

[2:25:40] handsomeboat: Hazel has been a deepfake this whole time
[2:25:41] Ryok: @Steinhelm using a virtual avatar instead of facecam/no cam
[2:25:43] TheDuelLogs: @Steinhelm Vtubing is just normal streaming, but with an anime avatar instead of a face cam
[2:25:48] hemsath1: @steinhelm virtual avatar
[2:25:51] ManderzBb: I really like the cloud theme idea
[2:25:55] mackerel01_: shes CGI
[2:26:02] Burritosalad: become a cloud!
[2:26:11] jeffdmk: we love how you dress and look
[2:26:21] TheDuelLogs: lol
[2:26:24] hemsath1: Hazel has her personal ray tracing option enabled
[2:26:26] Burritosalad: feenEHEHEH
[2:26:26] mackerel01_: and then you have lightning?
[2:26:27] McScooterson: I'm liking this idea more and more lol
[2:26:28] m4keyourself: I like it
[2:26:32] iDibby: where is your damage?
[2:26:37] m4keyourself: we're onto something
[2:26:40] IanSabrewolfe: Looking 'ordinary' is what makes it such a convincing deepfake, though!
[2:26:49] handsomeboat: "how are you?" "Wouldn't you like to know weather boy?"
[2:27:01] Starrwolff: Starrwolff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! woot thre months
[2:27:02] Streamlabs: starrwolff just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:27:02] jarkklet: can you fly with murlock mount ?
[2:27:03] Burritosalad: Hazel the angry gamer tornado
[2:27:10] ManderzBb: When AI is making these avatars it’s over 🥴
[2:27:20] exalted1715: maybe a talking Nut vtuber?
[2:27:22] SxeSarah: I didn't send my msg till you came back so you wouldn't miss it, but I think you still missed it.
[2:27:25] gammaraegames: i LOVE the beetle
[2:27:25] exalted1715: i could see it
[2:27:28] Dvlsknight: Tellix
[2:27:30] Ryok: i know a streamer who usually face cams but uses a vtuber when she doesn't feel great or after a hard day at work
[2:27:32] wombologee: I think Telix?
[2:27:33] TheDuelLogs: Vtuber avatars that are non-human looking are rare, I think more of them would be neat
[2:27:39] ShadyWire: i got 6 max level characters but i kinda want another one.. what should i level? spriest, mage or warlock?
[2:27:47] JasperCalico: Warlock
[2:27:50] gammaraegames: the beetle is so cute
[2:27:58] jarkklet: ahh thanks
[2:28:00] IanSabrewolfe: FaceRig is pretty fun to mess around with.
[2:28:23] JasperCalico: What an idea
[2:28:26] TheDuelLogs: yah they can cost thousands for even standard work
[2:28:26] ManderzBb: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2:28:29] Sacrenos: @ShadyWire easiest? Lock, by far. want a challenge? arcane mage
[2:28:32] ManderzBb: That is genius
[2:28:37] Ryok: you can get free avatars to start out but yeah if you want to "keep up" it's gonna get expensive
[2:28:37] nabilstendardo: A streamer I know who has a very interesting VTuber avatar of her wow main (a pandaren monk) is @DrizzlingRose
[2:28:38] ManderzBb: Blender and Unity!!!
[2:28:56] Sacrenos: @ShadyWire *challenge not in difficult skills, but in the fact that you die when someone sneezes at you
[2:29:12] ShadyWire: lol
[2:29:21] ShadyWire: fire mage maybe?
[2:29:23] nevarea: nooooooooooo
[2:29:32] ManderzBb: YouTube has some amazing  tutorials if you ever get the itch!
[2:29:45] Fellbundle: I think you would look great with short hair
[2:29:47] Ryok: if vtubing was a thing like 8 or 9 years ago when i thought about starting to stream i probably would've given it a shot
[2:29:48] gammaraegames: I think you'd look really cute with short hair
[2:29:48] McScooterson: Her hair is the best in that movie
[2:30:00] hemsath1: Go with the hair that makes you happy!
[2:30:10] cashthb: how did you survive 30 years without seeing grease?!
[2:30:14] Sacrenos: @ShadyWire that is a lot of reactionary casting, so if you like a game of whackamole with your skill bar, it is for you
[2:30:22] nabilstendardo: I have used blender since before it became open source (so at the end of the last century) - haven't touched it recently though
[2:30:25] Burritosalad: u need an afro and star sunglasess if u wanna funk it up
[2:30:31] ShadyWire: cool, i like that
[2:30:43] nevarea: lol
[2:30:51] Ryok: omg i just got the xavius leather shoulders PogChamp
[2:30:59] Robin_src: blender is very relaxing
[2:30:59] Ryok: one more farm i can skip from now on

[2:34:20] cashthb: i still can't can't believe you didn't see it. I'm so envious
[2:34:36] SxeSarah: Do murlocs usually run on all 4s?
[2:34:40] vadermug: what do you feed a grumbling belly?

[2:35:03] nabilstendardo: I got a long ad break now, with content in Swiss German... it's unfortunate that my IP address cannot be geo-located to the correct part of Switzerland, so I get stuff in all the languages of my country
[2:35:09] ctsuraun: definitely not rocks
[2:35:12] vadermug: sustenance. got it
[2:35:30] mackerel01_: raw spuds
[2:35:45] senpaibankai: Is the pop up quest thing you just did an addon? (Sorry new to the stream lol)
[2:35:49] meth_aq: @nabilstendardo How different is Swiss German from regular German? I'm learning German on duolingo
[2:35:53] etherealbeluga: That's me with potatoes.
[2:35:58] SxeSarah: I love broccoli... but I like it uncooked.
[2:35:58] xRedd7: baked broccoli with lemon and garlic
[2:35:59] onybear: That is green beans for me
[2:36:41] EnosRey: Air Fried is best
[2:36:54] saevenar: fish and green peas are so good together
[2:37:00] nabilstendardo: @meth_aq pretty far off, Swiss Germans need subtitles in German television
[2:37:18] xRedd7: you bake the broccoli till the "leaves" start to brown. also teriyaki broccoli is surprisingly good. i do the same with brussel sprouts
[2:37:19] onybear: Finding out that you can bake/roast veggies was a game changer for me, so many veggies are good roasted
[2:37:24] janahita: omg the other day I made these "smashed potatoes" they were the baby potatoes, with butter, cheese, chipotle lime sour cream, green onions and bacon
[2:37:25] solauna: baked broccoli is so good, roll it in some olive oil and salt pepper it maybe some garlic and roast it till some of the edges singe a bit. so yummy
[2:37:26] handsomeboat: I got an email from grubhub that said "candy for dinner again?" and felt personally attacked
[2:37:29] Ecamam: Chat , anyone know of an addon that can display class colour on player frames, this is the only thing i want to change on standard ui
[2:37:32] fuzzyshotgun: fuzzyshotgun subscribed with Prime. 
[2:37:32] Streamlabs: fuzzyshotgun just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:37:33] meth_aq: @nabilstendardo Damn, ok.
[2:37:41] mart1n_g: airfryer is just a less fancy oven
[2:37:52] nevarea: agreeed
[2:37:55] Duckie313: air fryers are just small fan ovens, if you have a fan oven, you already own an air fryer. :P
[2:38:06] GreenSween: On the food topic, Have you ever used any of the WoW cookbooks and do you have a favorite dish out of them if so :D ?
[2:38:06] meth_aq: @Ecamam Open options, type in "class" and it will be the first option for you
[2:38:12] stephthebee: I like it but for me air fryer is so bulky in size
[2:38:15] solauna: rather have a toaster oven rather than air fryer
[2:38:54] Ecamam: @meth_aq ty , i missed that completly
[2:39:00] SxeSarah: have you played DH?
[2:39:06] mackerel01_: here in ireland we just gnaw on raw patatos we pick from the fields
[2:39:21] TotallyNotRaien: man some questlines are so funny
[2:39:25] SxeSarah: I've been gearing mine lately. So much fun!
[2:39:27] Doomhauer: It took me forever to figure out how to do class colors on raid frames because I expected them to be in the options for the frames in edit mode.
[2:39:27] JasperCalico: there is an addon called "HealthBarColor" that does that
[2:39:32] TotallyNotRaien: wheres that questline with the 3 "princesses" from?
[2:39:35] nabilstendardo: @meth_aq as Swiss French, I learned regular German in school (since swiss german is a vernacular dialect, all the official stuff is in actual german), and I basically cannot understand any of their dialect
[2:39:43] SxeSarah: Top dmg in BGs and solo shuffle.
[2:39:48] senpaibankai: The new year sub mount @feber91
[2:39:50] ryIexxx: have you tried new shadow priest? very fun builds
[2:40:11] Doomhauer: Is this cataclysm chromie time or just regular old leveling?
[2:40:12] gammaraegames: oh the fish is very cute i hadn't seen the mountspecial
[2:40:13] meth_aq: the flying bug is one of the best flying mounts I've ever seen. but I'm not dropping a ton of cash for it.
[2:40:22] warwiz: might send it get 12 month sub for mounts 😆
[2:40:23] baltasarr80: What mount is that Hazel? It looks cool
[2:40:47] SxeSarah: wait, there's more than just the murloc?
[2:40:47] senpaibankai: What quest addon are you using that had a pop out like that? o.o
[2:40:51] AlexSinclair: that 12 month thing screams we dont think the expansion is good
[2:41:04] baltasarr80: ah menno -.- ok good to know
[2:41:08] jeffdmk: @ryIexxx I am really happy you are independent enough to say good things about shadow
[2:41:09] mackerel01_: il be playing wow until it shuts down but i have £15 to my name and no way my parents would give me enough for it
[2:41:10] deepgaysigh: I hope they put those new mounts on the shop in the future :(
[2:41:23] Dvlsknight: that'll be the Lunar New Year mount
[2:41:24] meth_aq: Damn that beetle looks soooo good ^^
[2:41:27] stephthebee: There’s a mount for classic also? With 12 month thing
[2:41:28] baltasarr80: i just resubbed for 6 months in Oktober ...
[2:41:39] radimier: so wait if we already bought the 6month last month and have the nether gorged wyrm we get less stuff?
[2:41:47] Dr4gonMouse: do you get the current 6-moth sub mount aswell?
[2:42:02] jeik_jkmc: yes
[2:42:05] Zacewing: must be depressing to assume bad faith from other human beings all the time
[2:42:19] Sarlyssia: i tried demon hunter when they came out, they started out in dd spec and i promptly yeeted myself of every cliff that existed. haven't touched anything other than tank spec demon hunter since LUL
[2:42:20] anko_48: My two problems with the 12 month is, for one you don't save any money, secondly its a huge cost up front
[2:42:28] SheWildWolff: any speculation what might be in store for the anniversary gift coming up?
[2:43:09] Sacrenos: I tend to play from like a month before the new expansion, and then like 2 months after release, and then stop for 1 or 2 expansions.... not buying 12 months :P
[2:43:17] Elswyth_62: duck
[2:43:18] Burritosalad: but the happiness the bodybuilder murloc brings to ur life is priceless
[2:43:18] vanafindial: yeah but your not going to stop playing so
[2:43:21] nabilstendardo: 17% XP buff?
[2:43:24] polygoncoke: Yeah the “new” Hillsbrad quests are so fun!
[2:43:32] cashthb: the ugly black dragonhawk was the last
[2:43:35] polygoncoke: Actually some of the most fun in the game
[2:43:43] radimier: i just wish if u already had the nether gorged wyrm from the last 6month u got a substitute of some kind
[2:43:53] Shaasta: I would have got the 12 month if my 6 month one didn't reup the same day lol
[2:44:02] mackerel01_: 2010
[2:44:04] Doomhauer: Where do I link my blizzard account to twitch?
[2:44:05] mackerel01_: so 12 years ago

[2:56:45] nevarea: use ice
[2:56:52] mackerel01_: gotta say im scared of nail polish
[2:57:07] zulsul: I'm morally against moving experience bars :D
[2:57:22] BlazeBrainCapital: When you aren't streaming, what music do you listen to?

[3:01:26] tiyanigean: @ItsGigg oh yeah, saved me the purchase XD sadly d3 sucked at first
[3:01:32] Sacrenos: you have to loot the body of the npc orcus killed

[3:01:42] mackerel01_: how do you even link your bnet and twitch?
