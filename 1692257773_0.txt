[1:29:51] quanion: it doesnt work

[1:29:52] Tropheus8five: turning off auto server worked for me
[1:29:57] Versified: @andyjyyr game is solid but haven‚Äôt touched it in a bit. Hits the Minecraft sandbox itch
[1:29:59] JustTrim: they probably use steam matchmaking and you can read all about how it works
[1:29:59] LemmyLimee: how is everyone getting in raid in EU at 3 mins?! WHILE MY QUEUE IS 15-20 MINS?!!!
[1:30:00] rune2hg: It doesn‚Äôt
[1:30:02] Vylent_: Words on Stream in queue? üò≥ üëâ üëà
[1:30:02] DarthFunkNinja: they only like operating a certain number of servers
[1:30:02] ParalyzedPosty: @shroud i find if you blast NICKELBACK at max volume in your headphones the matchmaking goes by way faster. have a good day brother rock on! maneSAUCED
[1:30:02] doofizzz: it doesnt work
[1:30:03] GrimeMinister: solo in to customs is quick usually
[1:30:05] Knutzi: i get decent queues, i have both NA and EU servers selected tho
[1:30:05] medoen: !drops
[1:30:08] DrippyMp3: and the fact that there‚Äôs not even skill based matchmaking or anything makes it even worse

[1:30:27] LPLEBATOR: its no MM...they just have a fixed amount of servers, greedy a fk KEKW
[1:30:31] ohmyabel: Turn off auto servers and select the closest ones to you. My queue time has been like 3 mins
[1:30:31] numberblue: better than Halo MCC in release T_T
[1:30:32] stagpul: Clueless
[1:30:38] shxaolinn: the need ue5
[1:30:38] NastyNateDoggy: Maybe it uses both the users servers, so if you have different ones selected, it might have a bigger pool to choose from
[1:30:38] AndyJyyR: @Versified ive been playing it so much recently, the new mistland update was really fun
[1:30:43] Knutzi: just give us dark and darker Sadge
[1:30:45] Pax0322: lmao....again
[1:30:48] diggi_420: I have endless queue as Level 1 on Svav, i mean ther emust be many new players queueing atm
[1:30:48] Chicken_Buff: When you are q with someone it tries to match you with other people who are also grouped, since there are less people playing in groups vs solo it's easier to get an available server (my speculation atleast)
[1:30:50] Under_Growth: I wouldn't hold my breath on fixing it, they can't even figure out email domains, and would rather just ban mainstream email domains instead of fix it
[1:30:56] davelit: shroudSip
[1:30:56] immenaj: we will
[1:30:58] cptwhoopass1: no they won't the game is gonna die, you have todo these same quests yet again
[1:31:01] LBPiggy: compared to dark and darker the queues were instant in that game
[1:31:03] chrisbreezy35: let them access stash & give a 5 second countdown then puts them in game
[1:31:03] negativ4_: it's hard to scale the servers, from tons of people in beginning to empty raids in late wipe
[1:31:06] Blakdot: Its only like this during the first couple of weeks, after that its mostly fine.
[1:31:07] Wrecktifier1: Escape from Queueueue
[1:31:10] piture: Well half the users do leave midway into the wipe and more left day after first day so they just never get enough servers

[1:31:13] tippidink: Waiting for players...
[1:31:16] tippidink: :)

[2:30:54] rato_de_esgoto88: @McSabros0n bitrate cap, 1080 60 fps on vegetation/noisy games already caps bitrate that twitch allows at like 8000 kbps, increasing it to 1440p will keep it at the 8000kbps limit and not benefit more

[3:44:52] gnfnrf: @Chatting0nAaYoinkedPhone Because when you are close to a wide monitor (or it is big) the edges are farther away from your eyes than the middle is, and the screen actually starts to turn away from you.  Your brain corrects for this, but it can only do so much, and with a curved monitor, it doesn't have to.

[3:55:19] nonames_87: soon as i turned it off tarkov ran normal again
[3:55:22] DragathorTheStreamer: the binaural audio does actually make the game lose a lot of fps
[3:55:22] bitspirit3: it's extra processing so sure why not
[3:55:24] Its_Pure_: audio caching files can cause memory leak, reducing frames
[3:55:25] LPLEBATOR: yep
[3:55:26] Sherm_Deez: i get 20fps more or better after disabling binaural
[3:55:26] DPedestrian: binaural audio uses cpu and gpu both and can ramp up very high very quick
[3:55:27] at1c: ak5 ohh they added swedish weapons
[3:55:29] Coachaye: it does reduce frames. i had a 30% jump when i turned off binaural

[3:58:23] Its_Pure_: i have a q oled, with hdr  it looks great
[3:58:24] rlmj0b: @shroud OLED means each pizel is individually lit instead of the whole screen being backlit, so you get better blacks

[3:58:25] johnthelongdon: it lets youa actually see differences in blacks which helps alot

You have games like AC: Valhalla, Red Dead Redemption 2 running flawlessly on similar hardware that looks more impressive and have bigger worlds.   The only thing Tarkov has over it is ballistics algorithms that it has to run.

[4:23:08] Rickybender: @Encryptors Yeah sadly thats why tarkov is always full of cheaters. At the begin of wipe not so much because its flooded with new players, but as the pop dies down the cheaters become more frequent in your games
