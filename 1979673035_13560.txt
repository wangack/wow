[6:46:17] HoyHey1: WoW
[6:46:17] Bali_d: no mana either KEK
[6:46:19] Reticent_88: Vanilla WoW is what started that whole thing. It was the game which dumbed and casual'd the whole MMO genre sajj
[6:46:21] kefyrasFTW: i was taking it slow, but when i join dungeons, they all rushing to the end, skipping lore and shit
[6:46:21] Meriveo: KEK

[6:46:30] BitsySweet: mmo journey should start from lvl 1 not 70
[6:46:31] Tooban: Its easy to see the mindset in later wow. They pretty much spoke on how they wanted to speed up the leveling so people could play together. They spend nothing in the leveling experience.
[6:46:36] Nightbot: Also live streaming now on Youtube for those that prefer it! https://www.youtube.com/@WehSing/streams
[6:46:38] akakaweis: carn master of edging

[9:49:20] DrSpookenstein: servers have layers so they dont lag, 12 layers per server iirc
[9:49:27] XcaliburYe: PepoThink but isn't there lots of realms or is this even differnt?
[9:49:29] esparsit: Layering only hapens when a population threshold gets reached i think?
[9:49:39] esparsit: Or did that change
[9:49:42] grimjak_: @XcaliburYe If you get shifted layers after killing mobs all the mobs will be spawned so you aggro everything and die
[9:49:48] yllsey: so layer = channels?
[9:49:49] Sandap: XcaliburYe, only 2 realms for hardcore.
[9:49:49] Verisimilitu: there's i think 12 layers?
[9:49:51] PiuPiuBlyat: @XcaliburYe Layer is like different dimensions, to prevent many players on screen cause it causes lags
[9:49:54] Gon_Dola: @XcaliburYe It's so you don't have 100 people on the screen and lag the fuck out
[9:50:03] Verisimilitu: and ya layer is kinda like channels in like say maplestory or smth
[9:50:04] esparsit: layering used to be unique per zone for example
[9:50:06] Altoid_: Ppl want to switch layer so they dont have to wait for respawn of mobs for grind or quests
[9:50:09] bigdojo: LUL
[9:50:10] kull1313: why dog is a bird?
[9:50:13] hauntinggaze: mmo can't handle 100 people on the screen?
[9:50:15] Lei069_: !roll

[9:50:16] Berksgorh: lvl 30 dude probably cleared ?
[9:50:31] Noscope360Blazeit: switch layer fuck it o7
[9:50:38] XcaliburYe: so is layer a new concept?
[9:50:39] issacar42: KEK could be dangerous since that means everything can respawn all at once
[9:50:39] Zbunka: gl killing 10 mobs with 100 players in a cave
[9:50:41] XcaliburYe: or has it always been there?
[9:50:45] hauntinggaze: kek everything is dead
[9:50:49] H3rja: @XcaliburYe has always been there
[9:50:51] 2BitPlaya: Chat what do you call a chicken that does math? a mathema-chicken
[9:50:53] Berksgorh: yeah quest zones not have enough space for 100 people doing same quest
[9:50:53] ramakrishna_surya: rip all the ursas
[9:50:59] yllsey: it's just channels in generic mmo term
[9:50:59] yusba: it hasnt always been

[9:51:02] DrSpookenstein: @XcaliburYe 5 years old or so
[9:51:04] jovitacky: its also that the servers cant handle 100 people on the screen at the same time

[9:51:10] XcaliburYe: hc is too hardcore for me
[9:51:11] Reticent_88: So what you're saying it, you're basically a drug dealer
[9:51:13] Mellomania: addict about to relapse ono
[9:51:13] hauntinggaze: sing world famous wow strimer soon?

[9:51:16] bunnyberg: @singsing is he avoiding addiction?
[9:51:17] Asphyxi4: idunno some of those big world pvp occurences makes it super laggy

[9:51:19] guardian1102: would he though? its quite the time investment
[9:51:19] l4nc3l077: @XcaliburYe simply, it means a different area, just a fancy name
[9:51:21] silent_7884: xdd do it steve
[9:51:22] landsknecht4: So how does hardcore work? Can some WIDEGIGACHAD come over and just kill you? Or is PVP disabled?
[9:51:29] Gon_Dola: @XcaliburYe one life, fuck it?
[9:51:33] Nightbot: Banned users will not be able to view stream anymore. Which means backseating = ban = no sing. Don't backseat
[9:51:35] heyitsMart: @XcaliburYe, it's for performance and qol purposes so you don't have 100 people competing for the same 5 mobs in the same area. realms is like an entire server while layers or shards are like different "instances" within a particular zone
[9:51:37] sea_fishu: LandanStyle
[9:51:41] dragon870: OI BRUV
[9:51:43] Urager: @XcaliburYe even if u die maybe a few hours to level with friends is worth the fun YEPYEP
[9:51:52] DrSpookenstein: @landsknecht4 pve server so people cant grief you
[9:51:52] fenren1993: how does hc wow work? does your char becomes unplayable if you die?
[9:51:53] yusba: PVP is disabled by default. only if you enable it manually can you pvp
[9:51:55] jovitacky: @landsknecht4 its pve, but you can enable pvp to fight with other pvp players i think
[9:51:56] heyitsMart: @fenren1993, yes
[9:52:00] XcaliburYe: @Urager Thinkge
[9:52:04] fenren1993: @heyitsMart how about raids ?

[11:51:17] byukino: there should be extra tabs hmmm
[11:51:19] chicke___: no, auctinator looks different
[11:51:22] arch1type_: @Kennrouz hardcore or classsic?
[11:51:23] hatduck_: @Kennrouz dont do it
[11:51:24] r0wstream: what you see is the default auction house - the addon is not working
[11:51:24] chicke___: its not enabled or sumtin
[11:51:26] yusba: this looks like normal
[11:51:26] esparsit: No auctioneer should make this easier
[11:51:33] Nightbot: Banned users will not be able to view stream anymore. Which means backseating = ban = no sing. Don't backseat
[11:51:36] icysystem: Auctionator is good addon for classic
[11:51:40] Berksgorh: holyshit you are reach 20 copper each
[11:51:41] Urager: maybe off by default
[11:51:43] Berksgorh: rich*
[11:51:49] byukino: see it in options?
[11:51:52] rip_jimmywopo: reload ui
[11:51:52] Alleleirauh: @pepegateevee theres a couple reddit threads for must have addons, theres a bunch of them
[11:52:05] mealtiime: type /reload maybe
[11:52:05] WitchKing__Malekith: jesus your ui is fucked up KEK
[11:52:08] pokerfaces: requires a restart?
[11:52:12] Kennrouz: @pepegateevee , I am gonna give it a shot at the free trial and then maybe I am going to take a subscribption for 1 month. But I think classic softcore
[11:52:19] ygg_druid: maybe just /reload
[11:52:26] kokoruru: reload maybe ShrugMango
[11:52:50] Philodrone: trading is so cancer
[11:52:50] esparsit: Youre getting the default ui for some reason
[11:52:53] chicke___: wtf why isnt it showing up
[11:52:57] chicke___: ElvUI conflict?
[11:53:09] Pinguinsx: probably conflict with ElvUI
[11:53:09] Gon_Dola: ask guild chat?
[11:53:09] PangurPlays: I think ElvUI is fucking with it.
[11:53:14] rip_jimmywopo: disable all then only activate auctionator
[11:53:15] r0wstream: yea i can imagine it doesnt work with elvui
[11:53:27] mostlylaughing: Try ticking 1st option in basic settings
[11:53:27] Polkio8: yeah check your elvui options
[11:53:28] chicke___: look into ElvUI
[11:53:33] Urager: but u only downloaded the recommended mods right so there shud not be conflicts
[11:53:35] esparsit: Maybe you need to enable an exception in elvui settings

[11:53:52] tabondhimek: I think u have to turn off the Elvui overlay for the Auction House
[11:53:52] WitchKing__Malekith: here
[11:53:58] Mysias: maybe there is an AH option in elvui that needs to be disabled?
[11:54:04] galinhoo: 2nd
[11:54:25] 4lmo: you should get auctionator
[11:54:27] chicke___: nothing

[11:54:40] kokoruru: kinda weird
[11:54:46] hatduck_: @urahara__kissuke why not. people who prefer yt can watch it there
[11:54:47] r0wstream: still default, just without elvui look
[11:54:50] mostlylaughing: you need to scan auctionhouse if i recal correctly
[11:54:51] GZANY: just ui changed
[11:54:53] arch1type_: @Kennrouz for sure do free trials first. For addons I think you better off not starting addons first then add them if you have some things troubles with classic wow.
[11:54:56] Gon_Dola: try disabling, reloading and then enabling?
[11:54:58] chicke___: Id check Auctinator options again
[11:55:12] dolkilu: man this ding ding sound reminds me of kunkka ghostship TheVoices
[11:55:12] tabondhimek: Elvui is purely estetic, but it can bug some addons
