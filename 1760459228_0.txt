[1:11:05] d1stract10n: will be nerfed

[1:11:56] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee well with scaling 50k isnt that much is it? say we are gonna have 400-500k health pools now, so 50k is what 25%?
[1:11:59] odawgxd: I mean Shadow priest peaking 150k HPS in a CD window. Also Shamans AG and NV for Druid does also shit ton of healing
[1:12:16] TJKlaenn: Yeah, but just wondering if it does gives stones.
[1:12:24] TJKlaenn: Because right now I have not been getting any Flightstones.
[1:12:24] odawgxd: @twinkieruler95 Its based of max hp. Calculated from about 300k hp now is 50k heal
[1:12:27] dreamwalker213: @Aendir_irl 4 dps keys are already a thing
[1:12:29] qtla: 50k is huge
[1:12:30] Hizuru1: who cares
[1:12:55] WundertueteGER: literally a better version of after the wildfires from guardians?
[1:12:56] qtla: you almost dont need heal
[1:13:02] oradros: tier set color is there too
[1:13:04] odawgxd: 3% * 5. So 15% max HP heal in one Divine storm
[1:13:16] odawgxd: Also 3% on tank is kinda thicc also, since they have a lot more hp

[1:44:50] sxarthur: @Jaren475 its PTR
[1:44:55] Morhig: Looking at it you wont be able to upgrade your current 415 M+ gear you will be required to get new items to upgrade them with the new system
[1:45:04] father_tito: also if you end up with some random trinket, as your trying for ur bis one, you are now automatically allowed to upgrade ur "bis" trinket to that one, AT 50% of the cost

[1:45:57] richardmu: @Towelliee what  does crest look lile?
[1:45:57] hammack52: the problem that people are not seeing while the crest part is greats and wonderfull and all but the fact that you wil have to collect the same pice of gear multiple time in this shit rng system they have to get it to the max item level instead of just upgrading it as you complete the higher content
[1:45:59] TJKlaenn: YEP
