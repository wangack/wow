[0:32:29] WaDaFruCK: possibly /use instead of /cast; but that usually isn't the case - most craftables accept both
[0:32:37] WaDaFruCK: maybe because love fool wasn't "fixed" at some point
[0:32:54] WaDaFruCK: IMO just type it in chat to see if it works with love fool only
[0:32:57] mettz: take target dummy out of bag and then try it
[0:32:57] maedas: why waste another masterwork and not just make a new macro with Love Fool alone?
[0:33:01] gikei: probably cause it has requirement for target and then just skips the first? maybe you could do [@cursor] so it instantly casts on your cursor
[0:33:14] WaDaFruCK: what does the #showtooltip show? that should show love fool if its going to use that one
[0:33:23] Toxiferous: cast is just Classic

[0:34:06] Toxiferous: swap the order
[0:34:17] maedas: I meant make a testing macro to see if it works independently, then merging it with the current one
[0:34:18] Toxiferous: that should do it
[0:34:32] mettz: try shift clicking love fool instead of typing it in
[0:34:33] Toxiferous: I believe
[0:35:28] WaDaFruCK: take masterwork out of the macro to test
[0:35:29] mettz: just thinking maybe you typed it in wrong somehow. maybe double spaces or something. maybe / cast cast
[0:35:33] WaDaFruCK: and see if it does love fool only
[0:35:53] WaDaFruCK: I think it will still use Masterwork

[0:36:11] WaDaFruCK: OH
[0:36:22] Toxiferous: POGGERS
[0:36:23] mettz: that makes zero sense
[0:36:43] WaDaFruCK: since its reticle targeting, it casts the first one, fails to cast because the reticle is active, then tries to cast the second one, overwriting the reticle from the first one with reticle for the second one.
[0:36:45] mettz: that‚Äôs backwards of every other macro ever
[0:36:55] maedas: Probably since the macro isnt waiting for the cursor input, if you put [@cursor] in it the original order would work
[0:36:58] Azathoth__: FAPs?
[0:37:01] mettz: wada 5Head
[0:37:01] WaDaFruCK: that macro won't work if you don't have love fools in your bags I bet; may not actually use the MW as itll overwrite the reticle with a failed message

[0:37:28] Azathoth__: @SalvDali not sure if i saw any FAPs in your bags
[0:37:31] WaDaFruCK: whats happening is:   since its reticle targeting, it casts the first one, fails to cast because the reticle is active, then tries to cast the second one, overwriting the reticle from the first one with reticle for the second one.
[0:37:37] WaDaFruCK: reticle targetting is odd
[0:37:39] Azathoth__: oh there they are
[0:38:04] Azathoth__: reticle is the aim graphic

[3:10:07] Gatoradeshame: @SalvDali Quick question about that wrath 3 set weak aura you have. Does it swap your wrath gear on, battleshout, and swap back to your normal gear all with 1 button press?
[3:10:45] NostalgicDream: i imagine its a cast sequence so you can mess it up if someone puts you in combat
[3:10:47] HankyPankey: when would u use hoj over earthstrike,badge etc?
[3:11:07] qqquentin23: no LH helm?
[3:11:09] Ranzorx: similar macro for dflask set?
[3:12:07] Demobalderes: People had maths for the HoJ/ES thing, think it was 50 seconds that ES became worse than HoJ iirc but can't remember exactly any more
[3:13:44] br0och: !r10
[3:15:30] sweaty_irl: its funny how endgame vanilla IS warrior but they dont even have naxx pieces for every slot
[3:15:47] qqquentin23: do you need anything from this raid?
[3:18:21] NostalgicDream: going back for osg, dft and goa
[3:18:44] globfather13: farming gruuls all of tbc wasnt fun though :(
[3:18:45] meepo699: yeahhh tbc only big one was dst not like gruul the most fun raid tho lol
[3:19:14] meepo699: tho guess ssc has some decent loot too tho and ssc was nice
[3:19:40] globfather13: Vash belt was massive until sunwell tier
[3:19:51] globfather13: the skips they added when p2 ended was perfect for that though
[3:20:04] meepo699: even bis for few or cmoparible. mage trinket nice. vestaments nice. not bis ofc
[3:21:03] globfather13: yeah 100% wrath made old tiers irrelevent especially with gammas and shit
[3:21:06] Toxiferous: also very few on use trinkets
[3:21:25] meepo699: yeah wrath i don't even know. there was the block set meme but they got rid of that
[3:21:34] meepo699: only thing that comes to mind
[3:21:45] Demobalderes: I kinda miss TBC lowkey, start is boring but once SSC (not so much TK) comes in it's pretty fun, and Sunwell is great
[3:22:08] qqquentin23: man perfect flask timing, ended right as boss died
[3:22:13] globfather13: TBC would be my favorite phase if you didnt need 5 shamans to raid
[3:22:21] meepo699: yeah group comp shit in tbc is rough
[3:22:26] meepo699: and annoying if u get the shaft group
[3:22:28] NostalgicDream: i defininitely regret playing som over tbc unbuffed raids sucked
