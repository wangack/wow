[1:28:52] Shakeboxing: Yeah,  you're in control of each one
[1:28:54] shadowghostytv: You are controlling the character, with your feet. Some people that dont have arms, uses their feet, blizzard cant ban them. So yeah its allowed
[1:29:23] iTzSouth: can anyone tell me if feral druid/ resto druid is good or bad in wrath of lich king? or should i plaay pally
[1:29:25] Yazkir: blizzard actually banned someone who uses a breath tool as a mouse and keyboard

[1:31:04] shadowghostytv: no i dont belive that. you are in control of your character all the time
[1:31:04] aviduser2: pedals are just like playing with a controller
[1:31:06] shadowghostytv: There is no way
[1:31:06] TheStickyIky: i doubt foot peddles would be bannable because what if someone with no arms wanted to play?
[1:31:20] Penden1: U should use a dance mat instead of pedals, so u can exercise and play at the same time xD
[1:31:26] ButterCult: If any company was ever crazy enough to ban foot pedals, it would be time to support a different game company

[2:28:38] Xlkoro: a mobile phone?
[2:28:41] Shouom_: I am mad about the server situation, because my realm got locked and my brother and his friend can't create characters on my realm to play together.
[2:28:55] DankDirk: If they could cloud store the bandwidth with each user it’s doable
[2:29:17] DankDirk: Make a mesh network
[2:29:47] DankDirk: Use the user’s bandwidth
[2:30:21] Shouom_: Planetside 2 works surprisingly well as an mmofps even with hundreds of people at one place

[2:31:37] HitmanGSMike: should i pvp at lvl 69 or 70
[2:31:54] DankDirk: I think we’ve lost the guild mentality and that’s why people aren’t playing as much
[2:32:10] DankDirk: Big guilds big fun
[2:32:20] Shouom_: Vehicles are unplayable without proper upgrades
[2:32:45] Habbe: that describes paladin in wow basically

[2:33:23] DankDirk: Me I’m the best Ret Pally
[2:33:25] DankDirk: Lol
[2:33:28] MonkikoBytes: their mana usage
[2:34:16] DankDirk: So what give them a bubble and stealth?
[2:34:23] bitlexx: the problem they have is a exponential math problem. Even if you scale the network cards to fight the max port number per ip address, you still have the problem of the auction house being fast, when 100k people access it (how is the buy/sell experience?), or world fights to broadcast combat log events
[2:34:52] Shouom_: It's funny how blizzard gave paladins a judgement speed increase in Cata just to not get kited
[2:35:19] DankDirk: @bitlexx can’t you instance the AH? And major bosses?
