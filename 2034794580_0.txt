[1:11:01] terranapart: dewLUL
[1:11:14] bestchaakbestjjang: @cdewx , if you play teleport back talent for deep breath, you can deep breath then verdant embrace then go back to max range kekw
[1:11:31] klocksmith: it would fix your team dieing
[1:11:42] zachgamegodx: so what’s the plan
[1:11:45] admiraltegetthoff: Would it be troll if verdant embrace pulled the target out of the fight?
[1:11:47] voygard: it is
[1:11:49] nikthevoker: FACTS
[1:11:53] voygard: way less stressfull too
[1:11:59] Bombdiggity3315: instead of verdant embrace it would be verdant "awkward hug with family members that you dont know well where you kind of lean in but dont really" embrace
[1:12:02] bestchaakbestjjang: games gonna be even more dead once solo rbgs come out lol.
[1:12:11] nikthevoker: 1 heal?!

[1:12:45] YoMamaSoFine69: qs on pservers for soloq are faster
[1:12:45] dawnovun: They would be trolled, 1 person leaves and fucks everyone, they get replaced by someone who joins a guaranteed loss

[1:35:07] zachgamegodx: honest opinion, you should focus on higher immo uptime on the 2 dps. hard vs this comp with the shaman and I think he’s dispelling them… also you should be going for fears on warrior when you’re health even tho he has zerker rage to get it on cd
[1:35:32] Itankarenas: immo is usually my top dmg by a decent amount
[1:35:33] Cybernytez: i think echo has now lontar on their team i saw them in valdrakken together not streamin, maybe they were doing wargames :o

[2:54:28] ohsomagical_: If your already playing guaranteed crit for builders and cold blood why would you need more crit
[2:54:29] kaoreal: Yeah depends on the comps in my experience

[4:34:31] freelofear: @RealXrave it is a close range healer, thats the point
[4:35:04] InkdAdam: @realxrave yep. shame because it’s so much more fun than the other healers

[5:18:09] Solastro: thought they all got layed off
[5:18:13] Solastro: a few years back
[5:18:17] DizziestShot: PvE players were always going to decide the tier vote
[5:18:30] Solastro: the thing is even m+ and raiders want different tier bonuses
[5:18:39] Solastro: they 100% needed to let us pick the bonus we want
[5:18:42] Cybernytez: ofc bc they are 80% of playerbase thats why this idea was bad
[5:18:43] Solastro: at the catalyst
[5:19:25] Itankarenas: How many times was Sam kicked and what was his precog uptime

[5:19:45] Peterbilted: get some resto brother
[5:19:47] Itankarenas: the one before. seems like ur getting kicked on cd
[5:19:49] Solastro: im fine with the community voting for which appearance, but the set bonus vote is such an awful idea, there was people trolling voting for the worst bonuses on classes they dont like
[5:20:11] Peterbilted: i meant to say rest
[5:20:17] Solastro: @mrcreatine123 since when do they give a shit about balancing though
[5:21:19] Itankarenas: destro must've gotten hate voted. anyone voting s1 is legit as 2Head as it gets
[5:21:22] mrcreatine123: @Solastro i mean... they have to care about balancing in order to keep the game playable lol

[6:13:45] ItsRahain: Evoker just doesn't really have a way to like ground something or death something or shift something etc. Feels like you just end up living in CC on that class unfortunately.
[6:14:11] ianryan306: what about nullifying shroud?

[6:18:35] VitoBambino: This is actually absurd https://clips.twitch.tv/VivaciousFriendlyParrotTheThing-QIqS8a1N0aPRVe3Y
[6:18:35] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[6:18:42] ItsRahain: @ShaHugs True
[6:18:46] mitchell_xd: anything different about classes with this patch?
[6:18:49] VitoBambino: For the last 40 seconds of the game, you were free from CC for 5-6 seconds by my count
[6:18:57] ianryan306: does sub rogue lose to anything currently besides other rogues?
[6:19:02] akafrosty4: I use m
[6:19:28] ItsRahain: Does Trill just think WW is bad rn?
[6:19:42] gibboking: have you tried holy pala much or is it meh
[6:19:47] akafrosty4: mt
[6:19:50] michaelss_: thought you were gonna say “if you lose as sub you’re bad” hahaha
[6:19:55] michaelss_: made me laugh
[6:19:55] jasonkbkt: Ww is bad because sub is Soo good
[6:19:58] mayfire15: @itsrahain sub is just better
[6:20:05] ItsRahain: makes sense.
[6:20:05] wokesmeedg: arent the patch notes wrong wth? it says 15% for grace period na dtimeless magic still has longer lasting reversion
[6:20:16] jasonkbkt: At least on their level
[6:20:23] akafrosty4: @gibboking i played tonight. it was fun. im not great though
[6:20:34] ianryan306: the patch notes seemed pretty underwhelming
[6:20:36] ohsomagical_: you gotta GID GUD to dodge the CC :D
[6:20:44] ianryan306: most of it is spells getting a name change lol like who cares
[6:21:05] ItsRahain: Just play Nelf and shadow meld it. Kappa
[6:21:12] ianryan306: “this ability still sucks… but with a new name!”
[6:21:40] RealXrave: you get to play in 2-3 second segments vs rmd, and sit 5-10 sec of cc
[6:21:49] RealXrave: it's fkn awful
[6:21:55] ItsRahain: so true
[6:22:03] ohsomagical_: its only because of the added clones, so nerf druid
[6:22:04] jasonkbkt: This is going to be a sick awc with na vs eu
[6:22:12] ItsRahain: I love looking back at cc and realizing I'm in it for 60% of the match
[6:22:22] Gr33nleet: Na seems et
[6:22:22] ianryan306: is this their main comp for awc?
[6:22:23] Gr33nleet: ez
[6:22:24] RealXrave: may the best rogue/rdruid/x win
[6:22:55] maybethistimepls: @RealXrave i mean can almost guarantee if u play rmd you wouldnt do nearly as good
[6:23:04] ItsRahain: I hear pika is a FA. Probably still best rogue.
[6:23:17] RealXrave: @maybethistimepls ?
[6:23:55] jasonkbkt: XD
[6:23:55] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[6:24:25] ianryan306: when an enemy’s fram disappears and then they die is that shadowy duel?
[6:24:28] mobilol: hi all, what is the best comp for destro lock atm?
[6:24:31] ianryan306: frame*
[6:24:49] krome2dadome: i've seen a 400k crit

[6:26:36] ianryan306: the best burst in the world is an 1800 ele player
[6:26:45] FlashZappa: I hit a 500k e surge today with blessing of summer
[6:26:47] shugguls: still not as big as trills blackout kick yesterday
[6:26:52] boocraft1992: the name disintegrate is perfect for that spell because letting that full channel on you does disintegrate you
[6:28:22] ianryan306: @comfycash on youtube is the best 1 shotter ive ever seen
[6:28:33] ianryan306: 1m+ damage in 2 globals on ele

[6:30:22] xilyx2: LUL
[6:30:24] ShaHugs: want to see my new enh mog?
[6:30:38] bornbetter: do you think verdant should remove roots too?  it’s so rough getting rooted when your next global is going to be verdant and then you have to waste a global to cleanse the root
[6:30:58] knappster15: Verdant needs to just be instant and not make you fly
[6:31:04] knappster15: need a talent for it or something
[6:31:04] ItsRahain: I think Pres still needs some more love.
[6:31:20] mayfire15: should you not be able to heal because of a root.. lol
[6:31:28] charmsrules: I guess it’s just a resto Druid xpac mhm
[6:31:31] ItsRahain: True, I vote we gut druid. Zzz Games.
[6:31:45] knappster15: was gonna say, at least we're not a priest LUL
[6:31:46] bornbetter: the verdant + rescue interaction with rop makes me cry every time gonestly
[6:32:13] RealXrave: has druid ever been lowest tier?   dont mean the beginning of a new expansion
[6:32:13] Korupcija_: bad food
[6:32:18] knappster15: Healing those cleaves cooked you
[6:32:20] mayfire15: what happen to disc. I feel it was good at start of season
[6:32:29] 69siguy: mw been ass for a minute now right?

[6:32:56] Aro725: need a little dr pep to wake up
[6:33:11] knappster15: its exhausting when your dps die from 60% in 1sec and then look at you like you were supposed to prevent that
