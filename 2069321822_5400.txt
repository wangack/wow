[2:10:03] TopFragDad: I LOVE Last Epoch's Loot Filter that's built in. Biggest selling point.
[2:10:12] Arvanah: its as much challenging as you want, corruption scale up difficulty
[2:10:13] belfastcl: as a casual arpg player, I have no idea what the endgame of any of them looks like
[2:10:16] breadwilton: are there like bosses or something with mechanics?
[2:10:21] s7wede: There is no such thing as a perfect RPG / ARPG. Somebody will dislike something just because
[2:10:23] breadwilton: im curious thinkin about buyin the game
[2:10:33] TheeCableguy: @Stompsville yes
[2:10:34] Pinetoad: Cant really compare anything to PoE, the game been out for a long time with constant content updates
[2:10:43] TopFragDad: Buy it. It's phenoominal.
[2:10:48] RaptureRiot: I think its a perfect middle ground for complexity
[2:10:48] avalanche_zero: def not better than poe , because poe is an older game with much more content
[2:10:54] Arvanah: main story bosses, dungeon bosses and end bosses of monolith have mechanics phasesw
[2:10:59] metavahn231: its gonna be like doing a m+20 solo
[2:11:01] Endofgreen15: yooo yoo
[2:11:01] im_capy: in todays climate, need more dev teams like LE makes games with passion
[2:11:03] thanesdoom1: Ive been playing since closed, big fan of it. Its a great start point for an ARPG miles better then D4, just hoping it catches up to PoE
[2:11:04] Sicknessqt: @Stompsville  its only 35 go for it. alot of cool builds and easily 200 hours of gameplay
[2:11:12] Jack_J0n3s: Im a sucker for all ARPG's lol I still play Lost Ark
[2:11:20] DarkStar0819: IMO - ANY game is worth playing at least for a little. What one person likes or dislikes, is not YOUR likes or dislikes. Just try it, you may like it. Geez.... <3
[2:11:25] H0lyCross_S: has ai keep saying LE is an entry drug for PoE
[2:11:27] TheeCableguy: tabs for free
[2:11:30] im_capy: Mike the dev is cool as shit
[2:11:33] GodKingMuninn: last epoch gives you five grand in free storage
[2:11:37] TopFragDad: Last Epoch is the ARPG game that has been catered and built around an entire ARPG "community" not just the dev team.
[2:11:43] biirrd: for v1.0 it has alot of endgame. And guess more will come, like uber bosses
[2:11:48] Hinzir: only QoL and systems does not make game best alone tho, gameplay is weak coımpared to poe and diablo
[2:11:50] Pinetoad: LE has some of the best systems, crafting, filters, build etc
[2:11:52] LastBoss: I like that maxroll give you filters in each build

[2:12:05] rbailey_2222: watching these videos it looks like its a really fun game
[2:12:09] s7wede: the loot filter is amazing since if you want to follow a guide, they provide one for you and it's a fire and forget solution.
[2:12:19] expbottles: 7 years of development... i have faith
[2:12:20] thanesdoom1: @RagingPunk yeah they reply on forums and ingame
[2:12:27] TopFragDad: Any and Every ARPG player needs to play Last Epoch.
[2:12:28] Pinetoad: You get easily 200-300 hours out of this game
[2:12:29] raldrik: its also cheap. Like goto mcdonalds drive thru rather than doordash twice and you get an amazing game

[2:50:50] im_capy: The Towelliee aerobic hour coming to a stream near you
[2:51:00] 07biby: now u can add another
[2:51:05] Ilibrit: omg wtf
[2:51:21] ambiotic: despair
[2:51:22] Kneckt: despair
[2:51:26] im_capy: This is why POE is taking this idea, its golden
[2:51:38] breadwilton: Is there a marketplace or trading?
[2:51:47] aspiration89: @aspiration89 Oh exactly. I don't mind either. Was just responding about them having overpriced micro :)
[2:51:49] gfield2k: So basically you should use that glyph first if you have something you want to keep. When you have max forge potential
[2:51:57] aspiration89: NotLikeThis
[2:52:06] gfield2k: An you want to get five affixes
[2:52:09] TheeCableguy: you always shatter items you dont need early
[2:52:14] TheeCableguy: instead of selling
[2:52:23] TheeCableguy: if it has ones you need
[2:52:31] 07biby: mats... u wouldnt have mats
[2:52:35] deestreezy: ahh this is that guy that milked out the warlock content
[2:52:36] im_capy: You need the ones that are for you
[2:53:03] TheeCableguy: So when your loot filter was showing 2 handed yesterday it probably had a modifier you wanted and needed to break it.
[2:53:06] gfield2k: You don't have to. But the possibility is there
[2:53:11] bathdraegor: you could, but you need to collet the runes and stuff to be able to.
[2:53:12] TheeCableguy: plus there is the advanced glyphs
[2:53:27] phyriall: I think between filters and a little less sweat and you can get through a lot of LE.
[2:53:35] TheeCableguy: there is also the advanced Monoliths
[2:53:38] Musty34: the leveling crafting will be resist only really

[2:54:03] Arvanah: @Towelliee there are 2 stages of monoliths, basic and empowered
[2:54:16] GodKingMuninn: I got to monoliths without dieing and doing my own build, very custom friendly
[2:54:23] Proto_Paradigm: You can choose whatever you want and still be viable for endgame stuff
[2:54:24] phyriall: What's this YT channel?
[2:54:26] TechGreen: you can do it from lvl 1 as long as it has forging potential for it
[2:54:49] Zenolo89: YT channel is action RPG

[3:19:08] TheeCableguy: I kinda want to watch the advanced crafting now lol
[3:19:30] PwntNub: @dudemisterbuddy No can't transfer at all. There will be no leaders or anything on offline. But I suppose it just depends on the individual if its waste of time etc. The way I see it, is if I am wanting to play while everyone else is locked out of online/lagging/unplayable I can learn the my build offline :p
[3:19:41] Panadol324: javeling starts from level 18 :P
[3:19:44] Uglyfoot: Switching isnt bad, just dont switch your main damage ability until you level it's replacement.
[3:19:58] dokor: you also could spec javelin in a different way that suits you better, the game is flexible enough that you really don't have to follow a guide to the letter

[3:34:24] valianya: @towelliee  What makes me angry about D4 cosmetics isn't the horse bundle or the store.  It's because since launch the only cosmetics added to the actual base game to earn in game have been bad and bland, even the winter holiday cosmetics in game were garbage.  Meanwhile the winter store cosmetics were banging.  Every half decent new appearance is cash only.  Nothing in base game is worth trying to earn because it's all boring.

[5:11:08] Longsokz: invite me Tow, I cant get into camp :)
[5:11:16] Elaurian: "Working on stabilizing matchmaking. The requests volume is... humbling. "
[5:11:18] Zolare: @PokerFaceMoose lol ty for getting it
[5:11:18] Lulaboo: I cant enter game
[5:11:24] Elaurian: "We're also deploying the launch arguments that will allow full offline mode when you boot the game on Steam.  Restarting Steam will allow you to boot in that mode now if you'd like."
[5:11:33] Longsokz: right lmao
[5:11:37] Mushythegoblin: my steam is updating it again

[5:12:23] JasperCalico: Blizzard can't even do it after 20 years OMEGALUL
[5:12:25] im_capy: AAA studios shit the bed on launch days, so was expected imo
[5:12:26] Longsokz: they said they sold a million copies

[5:12:44] 91Niki: You can have the server capacity, but not have the "door" / entry capacity. If that makes sense. Too many people trying to squeeze through a door at the same time
[5:12:53] jonny_uk1133: i work in Networking ... with platforms like Azure with scalabile infrastructure, this shouldnt be a problem anymore

[5:14:13] grimginder: But if you play offline, that charcter cant be played online right? looks like two different character creation types

[5:33:34] 91Niki: Bees are in limbo, standby
[5:33:42] Verdell263: Looks like having to work isn't keeping my from anything with this launch LUL
[5:33:47] TheMysticBean: Can only gift others you've played with. you need resonances, like the currency in lost ark for mail
[5:33:50] rayx52: nooby question chat i can change my passives point and do it again ?
[5:33:50] Ivaed: im stuck at character select still
[5:33:55] madm4rsh: You can;'t farm mobs don't respawn
[5:34:02] madm4rsh: I am stuck in burning forest nothing to farm anymore
[5:34:06] Gorolash: still better experience than playing D4
[5:34:14] keep_dying: @rayx52 yes
[5:34:16] 07biby: NPC?
[5:34:20] TheeCableguy: not in passive
[5:34:26] keep_dying: Just costs gold
[5:34:30] TheMysticBean: @rayx52 You have to visit the vendor in town to change passives
[5:34:37] TheeCableguy: yup
[5:34:42] RoarTV: @Towelliee Do you know of any WoW US guilds on EU servers? I move from the UK to the East coast in a couple of weeks and would prefer not to start a fresh after 15 years :D
[5:34:49] 07biby: i like gooold
[5:35:00] rayx52: oh thats helpfull guys
[5:35:03] rayx52: ty
[5:35:13] TheeCableguy: Judd just logged off the game xD
[5:35:14] RoarTV: Thought as much >:(
[5:35:17] Wulfgrym: us is not sweaty enough for eu
[5:35:18] Slipperysud: Just got my first graded card back from PSA yesterday, super stoked to have it back
[5:35:31] Longsokz: why they didnt have a stress test? smh
[5:35:37] t0csik: u can have 2 pets at once ...
[5:35:41] Kakotan2143: @Slipperysud kool, what one?
[5:35:52] Cmill: @Longsokz no stress tests prevents this
[5:35:56] Ariea_Whisper: @roartv just okay on eu you should be fine Sloot used to do it with out issues
[5:36:01] 91Niki: @Cmill Exactly
[5:36:03] 07biby: uz its better to undershoot than to over
[5:36:06] TheMysticBean: It's already dropped by 10k
[5:36:08] TheeCableguy: On the plus side Helldivers 2 is probably not full right now.
[5:36:15] Slipperysud: @Kakotan2143 Trevor Lawrence Color Blast
[5:36:16] mcvultur: Restart game it will work @Towelliee
[5:36:16] cynical_effect12: @Longsokz they did stress test.
[5:36:17] Dubh13: luckily you can just play offline if you really wanna play
[5:36:20] volkreig: Peak EU time
[5:36:22] TamaskaVT: I'm just playing offline which is fine
[5:36:25] ambiotic: They did stress test a few times
[5:36:36] Longsokz: @Cmill actually thats what its for
[5:37:02] Ivaed: @Cmill no it doesnt. stress tests are only as good as the number of people that participate in them. The current user count is over 5 times the maximum number of players ever playing the game before
[5:37:04] t0csik: this is the stress test :))
[5:37:06] dschmidt: !DROPS
[5:37:16] Longsokz: @cynical_effect12 i missed it
[5:37:25] Cmill: @Longsokz you dont understand.
[5:37:26] Kakotan2143: are the controls pretty much much like Diablo4 ?
[5:37:30] TheeCableguy: I am stressed alright
[5:37:37] Khirae: !drops
[5:37:43] RoarTV: @Ariea_Whisper thanks :D
[5:37:49] ambiotic: It wasn't a stress test more the launch of online play which was a big deal when it happened, last time you to connect from an Irish vpn to get in lol
[5:37:52] 91Niki: click to move
[5:37:53] Prevention6: they should give people a free little cosmetic as incentive for participating in stress test lol
[5:37:56] jiffynuts: you could watch the borderlands movie trailer while you wait? :)
[5:38:05] jiffynuts: I haven't seen it yet, just saw it was releeased
[5:38:08] 91Niki: Oh the trailer is out !
[5:38:09] TamaskaVT: You can change the controls to be more like Diablo if you want
[5:38:21] jiffynuts: oh?
[5:38:22] jiffynuts: whoa
[5:38:29] Deathacon: cant even log on to my legacy people
[5:38:32] 07biby: earth
[5:38:33] mcvultur: @Towelliee  The thing is past 2 weeks iv been playing and there was a 1 min waiting  at some maps ... so if that doesnt work with 1k-3k players how are they expecting to work in release ?
[5:38:34] dschmidt: that dude is everywhere right now
[5:38:34] jiffynuts: I loved that show as a kid
[5:38:35] HebrewPlays: i hit 5, but im stuck on the other side of that door.  send me a rope and pull me through!
[5:38:37] raldrik: By your powers combined
[5:38:37] rbailey_2222: i love that show growing up
[5:38:37] Prevention6: borderlands 2 was amazing , the other ones were decent
[5:38:40] Ivaed: Current Status: 150k CCU and the initial burst of volume has our matchmaking services experiencing some issues that we're quickly working to rectify. We're in the war room with our backend team and service providers turning all the dials and knobs as quickly as we can.  We've just deployed Steam launch arguments that will allow people to boot the game in full offline mode when clicking Play from the Steam library. That will require a Steam client restart to access.  - LE Devs

[5:40:14] Scippa12: I see some streamers are playing past this point? could they just be offline?
[5:40:33] TheeCableguy: @Scippa12 yup like wudi

[5:40:59] Saintdahl: servers boss
[5:41:06] Saintdahl: main event
[5:41:08] DusttBuster: When you spec into a skill, do you level it up just by uising it?
[5:41:10] Liquid_vsop: How easy/hard will Last Epoch be to pick up? compared to like PoE?
[5:41:27] Grayfox3d: I'm excited to try out the rogue class in this, remiinds me of the good ol D3 rogue days lol
[5:41:30] Saintdahl: @DusttBuster ye
[5:41:40] 91Niki: WTF that Borderlands trailer KEKW
[5:41:49] TheeCableguy: Captain Planet got them
[5:41:53] Mesoz: @Liquid_vsop Much less complex than poe
[5:41:54] bozipo: maybe if someone is in fortess all rdy tp to them
[5:41:58] DarkStar0819: Logged out to see if I could get to the next level by chance --- Now when trying to log back into the game, it states that their is no ONLINE available... DO NOT LOG OUT!!!
[5:42:07] Prevention6: @liquid_vsop the skill trees have more depth than Diablo but not as crazy as poe so somewhere in between the two
[5:42:14] Maellin: @liquid_vsop more than d4 less than poe
[5:42:36] Saintdahl: @Liquid_vsop idk about Towelliee rules about talking about other creators. But i will say it is really easy from PoE
[5:42:44] genjosanso: am i the only one who dislikes the fact that to play a sentinel i need to play with a black character!
[5:42:45] rymerre: i just made an online mode so that progress

[5:43:30] Saintdahl: @genjosanso d2 lod paladin was also black
[5:43:33] Kapatha: LE discord new updated message for those who read discord
[5:43:49] DarkStar0819: @Towelliee - That is most likely the reason you can't get to the next level, because there is no ONLINE services available... Just saying... <3

[5:45:57] 1Gmark: all good. just sometimes games feel super sponsored without #ad in the title. but the affiliate thing explains it
[5:45:58] Prevention6: advertisement is still important even for great games
[5:45:59] jasperboy: I got DC'd. now it says Online play unavailable towRee

[5:49:09] Prevention6: yeah that affiliate payment link is a really good streamer incentive
[5:49:10] 91Niki: Oh dang it, you can't move characters in the character list

[5:51:11] cyb0rg_007: @towelliee always goes full out for chance of winning
[5:51:22] brewgamingtv: no point to play offline mode cuz that doesnt go to online mode
[5:51:26] ddsoad: for the offline mode
[5:51:28] ukinii: AlienDance
[5:51:29] Panadol324: Fun fack in Offline the chat still works :D
[5:51:35] warriorzen: @towelliee what game would you say had the best launch that you have experienced?
[5:51:40] karnophagemp: So you can't share items between your offline characters
[5:51:51] cyb0rg_007: I find them hard to find or get to
[5:51:55] Panadol324: Just test alts on offline
[5:51:58] jasperboy: @warriorzen I'd say WOD launch. Kappa
[5:52:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: About 140K in game right now, on Steam
[5:52:15] im_capy: towHAMUP sitting here doing the same
[5:52:18] Saintdahl: @Panadol324 so who would u be chatting with? hmm
[5:52:19] GodKingMuninn: I had no issues on WoD launch
[5:52:20] PoisonMichael: Fck offline :P
[5:52:21] ambiotic: I thought dragonflight is pretty good
[5:52:22] KralYoshii: @Towelliee you COULD level up ur senechel in D4 lol
[5:52:29] Exodeo_: garrison lol
[5:52:31] Gorolash: Legion was best in everything
[5:52:35] im_capy: Classic era launch was crazy
[5:52:37] Raddius: This might be a good time to remind everyone about the benefits of personal grooming and tools they might use for that.
[5:52:37] Voidlash: I was here..
[5:52:40] Amalgamut: Not to throw shade, but the D4 launch was smooth as shit. ABout a minute or two wait in the first day.
[5:52:42] ambiotic: Wolcen was the worst launch, they just took servers down for 3 days and after they brought it back up all your gear was gone
[5:52:47] Voidlash: also had to deal with my Queuefinder lol
[5:52:49] bison_86: LUL
[5:52:54] dinerbr: draenor only had some problems at the start if i recall with the garrison telescope thing
[5:52:57] Panadol324: @Saintdahl Chat is working normaly in offline , people there chating all the time
[5:53:04] DarkStar0819: This is bad... really bad
[5:53:08] Armdel: just hop on for a couple of duriel kills...
[5:53:08] bozipo: try to TP to someone in Gardens
[5:53:29] Prevention6: wolcen was actually kind of fun it's a shame the game was a flop
[5:53:33] SirTiim0thy: Im am trying offline mode to see how gamepad works, i like playing gamepad for when i switch to steam deck
[5:53:42] Mesoz: You can join someone who is in gardens and tp to them
[5:53:44] Cookiedropz: they knew and still didn’t prepare which is what blows my mind 😆
[5:53:46] DarkStar0819: Should have gotten better servers...
[5:53:46] dinerbr: most people will play in the weekend anyway
[5:54:12] youdonodamagemyguy: Offline mode is fine they just need to give us a ONE TIME option to transfer to online mode when servers are stable.
[5:54:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: i remember everyone being stuck on the helicopters in pandaria
[5:54:30] Armdel: i also remember frostfire ridge having some quest that only could be done 1 player at a time
[5:54:49] skaispiritx: Made it past Fortress Garden and walls now they want me to go back to Keeper's Camp :(
[5:54:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: servers would stablize before they could even develop that option
[5:54:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I wasn't able to do anything in Draenor for like a day and a half, while we waited for devs to fix the broken horde questline
[5:55:04] unreachedx: When you can transfer from Offline to Online you can Hack super esay in Offline and then Take it online ^^ so its great its not there :D
[5:55:06] Panadol324: Online is complet off so you wont get to new area since nothing is on
[5:55:13] ambiotic: that is the workaround i guess
[5:55:17] ambiotic: find someone in gardens and tp
[5:55:27] warriorzen: I thought pandas was a good launch. If I remember cata went good as well expect I logged in 2 seconds early to the old servers and then had a 6 hour que to get in lol
[5:55:29] jasperboy: @HaxzorJimDuggan I was lucky enough to scoop through those helis at the start. Same with WOD. I got out real quick from the non-optional garrison stuff. When I was max level, my friends had barely left frostfire ridge
[5:55:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: dreanor was the expansion that got me remote access from my phone to my pc lol
[5:55:50] SirTiim0thy: I keep waiting for XP orbs to show up..to much deep rock for me
[5:55:56] arturiuss44: reason being offline players can mod and use cheats so would not be fair to people who legit leveled online is what I read why no transfer from off to on.
[5:56:12] GGScubaSteve: someone in game said "looking for D4 inv" lol
[5:56:23] Shearkahn: Diablo III Launch was alot of fun
[5:56:42] DarkStar0819: Online Play Unavailable
