[1:49:43] SavedEight_ZGZ: poke hole in bottom of egg, boil for 5 minutes 30 seconds. perfectly runny soft boiled egg for ramen. go 7-9 minutes for a similar consistency as soft boiled but less liquidy yolk. go 11-14 minutes for hard boiled. any egg let it sit for 2 minutes inside ice bath. last step is to make 12 salads and add egg to every single one
