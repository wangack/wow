[8:07:34] HatedHero_Uttress: hi, chat. hope you're all having fun. :)
[8:07:38] cosmin284: fuegoYETH fuegoGaming  in the wrath fuego arena matches
[8:08:12] kenjimotohh: Blizzard should do what OSRS did and release vaulted content from old dev team
[8:08:12] Zefior: Also give us dk ok thanks xffCute
[8:08:20] kenjimotohh: Wrath had peak subs in 2008
[8:08:35] kenjimotohh: Subs fell off more than ever after Cata came out back in the day
[8:08:52] Pyroheet: alter time brings you back to the location you were in and the same health after pressing it the second time,
[8:09:15] NurfMe206: like tracer in overwatch
[8:09:35] kenjimotohh: Wrath is the best xpac in WoW franchise and Cata killed it. So what I am saying is them releasing Cata AGAIN is going to kill what classic means to a lot of us
[8:09:35] cosmin284: will fuego  great fuego tweet Daisy fuegoFeller fuegoL fuegoH fuegoQueen with the sod phase 2
[8:09:37] Pyroheet: its defensive ability
[8:09:37] kenjimotohh: per your title
[8:10:25] kenjimotohh: also you may not remember but you 1v1'd my friends and i in a BG way back LUL
[8:10:42] Arthident: ded
[8:10:54] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[8:11:35] kenjimotohh: Cata sucked ass
[8:11:37] DuoX: catas first raid tier was better than wrath tbh
[8:11:47] Elijahss: see someone always thinks a certain xpack is sooo bad, but they were all fun
[8:11:49] Todd686: Hmmm
[8:12:23] NurfMe206: wrath finished the og warcraft3 story
[8:12:28] Zefior: BFA+Shadowlands killed WoW i would even dare to include legion because the ap grind fest started in legion
[8:12:43] kenjimotohh: copium LUL
[8:13:08] kenjimotohh: unfortunately people will still sub and inject copium so blizzard will keep releasing retail xpacs sadge
[8:13:14] Pyroheet: @Zefior i liked Ny'alotha it was really nice patch tho
[8:14:03] Zefior: @Zefior i agree ... although the ending was a complete joke getting rid of an old god like that fuegoSMH
[8:14:36] Dissuxx: EZ Clap
[8:14:52] cosmin284: fuegoYay fuegoGaming  wrath fuego arena match win
[8:15:04] Kaiivax: nah, MoP was best
[8:15:08] Todd686: DonkCrayon
[8:15:14] Elijahss: Naxx was old content, and ToC was not a good raid
[8:15:16] DuoX: legion was the best wow
[8:15:17] Pyroheet: @Zefior yah they way they did it piss me off, how could you get rid of old god like that it was a joke even the cinematic man docnotL
[8:15:18] cosmin284: DonkCrayon
[8:15:24] Kaiivax: @DuoX legion was amazing
[8:15:32] Zefior: but how can wrath be peak if no one is playing it ? Hmmm
[8:15:33] Elijahss: Wrath had one good raid
[8:15:59] DuoX: the first raid tier of cata was better than any raid in wrath
[8:16:02] HatedHero_Uttress: Cata killed many pvp hybrid specs and added boring talent trees
[8:16:08] claud1928: RESIST RESIST RESIT
[8:16:18] cosmin284: fuegoNotes
[8:16:19] Dissuxx: I liked cata pvp honestly
[8:16:28] cosmin284: kermitNODDERS
[8:16:48] hop__: MoP S tier
[8:16:51] bassey_: MoP was pretty good
[8:16:51] HatedHero_Uttress: I think MOP had the best pvp but lacked in other areas
[8:16:54] emilyo97: Mop was wow peak
[8:16:58] DuoX: cata added goblins making the horde finally worth playing,
[8:16:59] Dissuxx: MoP was one of the best expansions after WotLK
[8:16:59] Drewskee_: MoP lore ruined wow lmao
[8:17:12] Pyroheet: wotlk and cata has the most player count
[8:17:12] Zefior: mop might be the true peak gameplay wise
[8:17:15] Drewskee_: Pandas
[8:17:18] emilyo97: it is
[8:17:23] HatedHero_Uttress: the raids were actually pretty interesting. MoP quests added a lot of new quest types too.
[8:17:33] emilyo97: who gives a fuck about lore
[8:17:42] bassey_: siege of orgrimmar was a great raid
[8:17:46] Dissuxx: Siege of Orgrimmar was one of the best raids, even better than ICC tbh
[8:17:50] platologos: SMOrc
[8:17:56] Like_seriously_dude: i identify as a panda and im sitting at my desk stunned at the panda comments
[8:18:10] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[8:18:17] HatedHero_Uttress: the lore chased people away, even.
[8:18:24] Zefior: mop cant have ruined the lore because it had little impact overall, shadowlands on the  other hand oh my ...
[8:18:27] NurfMe206: fuegoVibe fuegoSpin fuegoRave
[8:18:31] Dissuxx: He was CEO of Activision Blizzard
