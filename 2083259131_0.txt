[0:07:01] spivet: I think I commented something in here the other day about people who are very mad about wow and have strong thoughts about it despite not really playing it in years, and that feels pretty relevant when it comes to asmon and mythic
[0:07:32] progonitelj: bro i have 9/9 and i still think mythic is shit
[0:07:39] progonitelj: you don't need to play to see it's shit or not xD
[0:07:45] spivet: @progonitelj it is possible for mythic to be bad and for asmon to be wrong about why
[0:08:07] Reiven_____: @spivet they just want to feel justified that they left the game, so they keep bashing it
[0:08:21] progonitelj: mythic hard well nope , punishing on other hand yeah

[0:10:56] masterdannix: @progonitelj What else would you like it to be?
[0:10:56] hawk748: wow should have focused more on pet battles. that's where they went wrong

[0:11:02] Fun_Mo: maxJAM
[0:11:03] mjaber20: there are guilds 1000 plus pulls in on tindral and still no kill, mythic is bad right now
[0:11:10] Zorto5: bring xiv nightclubs to wow
[0:11:10] spivet: @progonitelj as opposed to in the past, where you cleared heroic and then there was literally nothing to do because m+ didn't exist yet

[0:11:25] Thdlock: @mjaber20 those guilds shoul disband and get rid of the shit players baseg

[0:12:38] spivet: @Thdlock people might actually enjoy mythic more if they were okay with ending at 7 or 8/9 and not fruitlessly wiping for 2 months on a boss they will never kill
[0:12:52] Adrang: wait if they disbanded, who would be left to get rid of?
[0:12:53] GrimFandango: @Ivaed he's just memeing, don't take it too seriously
[0:13:00] Thdlock: ye but mythic is a challenge mode
[0:13:02] XadanarGaming: @Ivaed That is a heroic raider mindset
[0:13:03] MONNlBLAST: @ivaed you can accomplish in heroics. Why should everyone be able to clear mythi

[0:13:39] mjaber20: how do people keep their sanity 1000 pulls in, couldn’t be me
[0:13:51] ErkyDog: let @thdlock cook
[0:14:05] XadanarGaming: If you raid to have a good time with your friends there is normal/heroic/LFR if you are raiding to challenge yourself you raid mythic
[0:14:08] Fun_Mo: 1 wipe and i gquit
[0:14:12] ectemian: rwf raiders lost their sanity years ago
[0:14:12] codydoubleu: my alts that have never entered mythic feel pretty BiS geared, mythic is nowhere near a requirement anymore
[0:14:13] progonitelj: @mjaber20 they are chinese xD
[0:14:16] XadanarGaming: and hope your friends dont suck
[0:14:18] PvtCheese: @mjaber20 1000 pulls is a bit exaggerated but theres almost always something to improve - you look for that and work on getting better
[0:14:23] Ivaed: @MONNlBLAST not saying everyone but 1000+ pulls on a boss shouldnt be a thing honestly even the most scuffed guilds should be allowed to clear content if they put in that much effort
[0:14:29] Alienjuggernaut: @maximum it’s not Saturday

[0:14:50] leubinator: garf third monday
[0:14:52] Dzor12: Pull count is an awful metric for Tindral since most wipes are <1 minute, you need to look at prog hours, not pull count
[0:14:53] Zorto5: @Ivaed no they shouldnt lmfao
[0:14:54] ushio96: when S4 anyone?
[0:14:54] NotD4k: @Ivaed wrong, I think last mythic bosses should not be cleared by casual aotc players sorry
[0:14:55] rbgdev: one time my gf said its me or that raid tonight, and thats the night we got pregnant and stopped playing wow
[0:15:01] ErkyDog: leave mythic as content that some people can’t clear. that’s fine. heroic is plenty good enough, guys. if you want the challenge of mythic, push for it. but don’t cry thag it’s too hard.
[0:15:10] baddecisiondanx: @Thdlock L
[0:15:13] XadanarGaming: After the most recent nerfs to tindral nobody should be getting close to 1000pulls if you even are getting over 400 pulls post nerf your guild is  fundamentally incapable of mythic raiding
[0:15:14] Regroot_Gaming: @ushio96 they said sometimes in april
[0:15:18] Ivaed: @NotD4k it's my opinion and you dont have to share it. doesnt make it wrong
[0:15:20] chubbytheboi: @PvtCheese Didn't Skyline do more than a 1000 pulls on Tindral in the RWF?
[0:15:21] codydoubleu: @flutterbaby same, almost have fyrakk down and am praying lol
[0:15:29] Starforkx: @leubinator jfc i will do my best to never say wednesday again, only 3rd monday from here on out
[0:15:41] GrimFandango: BDG and Skyline both had 1k pulls on Tindral and close to that on Fyrakk
[0:15:43] FlutterBaby: @codydoubleu i'm 1/9 it ain't gonna happen but hoping you get it!
[0:15:44] Thdlock: @PvtCheese ye skyline is a shit guild so is bdg
[0:15:46] spivet: if mythic had cross realm and got rid of the stupid lockout I would have no notes, I can't commit to the schedule anymore but it being so annoying to pug for so long sucks
[0:15:47] progonitelj: @ErkyDog if mythic didn't get one single nerf like after echo and liquid killed it. How many guilds you think would kill fyrakk on mythic ?
[0:15:53] Thdlock: shouldve never gone for rwf

[0:17:11] Isolol: @vannerosenpai and was carried*
[0:17:14] spivet: there is value in having a top end of difficulty that's actually hard. otherwise you get the speedrun/parse stuff in classic which I find extremely cringe
[0:17:15] Starforkx: @FlutterBaby im sure it's cuz he wants the game to be in a better state, or at least a state he feels is better
[0:17:30] progonitelj: @NotD4k why ? this is just a game after all ?

[0:18:19] mjaber20: I have no issues with the difficulty of mythic right now, atmosphere and the people you are completing it with matter, that’s what keeps the enjoyment of the game going.
[0:18:23] faythes68: also this game is maintained by citizens that mostly do normal/13s/pet battles, and most don't even know there is a difficulty above heroic

[0:23:02] ItsYent: @Starforkx yeah its just like when he says shit like "theres so many chores in retail" that screams you dont play the game currently. also the popular take of "each patch my progress gets invalidated" which technically was always the case even back in classic. the difference is like this season you got catch up gear at 424. S2 bis was 447 so your S2 gear was still better than the catchup S3 gear
[0:23:05] chubbytheboi: @Maximum Get in a call with THD and discuss this. I hear he has some real good takes on the game in general
[0:23:06] jin_spear: @Benjg7 bro the addons ones. coming from someone who hails mods so much

[0:23:27] Ivaed: that's how my oldest dog biscuit is too lol
[0:23:37] m_dep: is it the time of the season when people spend more time talking about WoW than playing it?
[0:23:43] PvtCheese: Asmon hasnt been relevant since classic/tbc, why do people even watch him
[0:23:47] XadanarGaming: THD's take is factual though
[0:23:49] spivet: @eyeztea gotta get those two in call for a cook off

[0:34:58] zamow1994: legion had a lot of new systems
[0:35:01] Thdlock: and they added 1 a patch
[0:35:02] krazeturtle: like the raids came out on the 0.5 patches
[0:35:04] Piki9: Legion had multiple raids and new dungeons @maximum
[0:35:07] Taytor: legion had 10 dungeons at start and 3 more added, and argus was like 4 zones
[0:35:16] JoaEUW: Boy i would love a max with asmon podcast
[0:35:18] wademoney3590: so its ok that FF is predictable?
[0:35:19] CloudyHS: NEW CONTENT = BORING CAUGHT
[0:35:21] Brobi: @Maximum your chat and Asmon's overlap making it hard to read. If ou move your cam to top left it will be great as well as it covers some of the text
[0:35:22] leubinator: 5 zones 9 dungeons!
[0:35:24] bayazijr: Random thought but the wow community cares way way way way way more about game design than any other gaming community i have seen
[0:35:25] BipolarPongal: Suramar Kreygasm
[0:35:27] Aqinog: THD KEKBye
[0:35:29] mjaber20: he also enjoyed taking massive alliance group into Org and killing all the horde
[0:35:32] mjaber20: fun to watch
[0:35:36] thmpr324: remember when we thought they were gonna make new dungeons throughout DF
[0:35:36] rbgdev: @JoaEUW theyve done it like 2 times
[0:35:38] wasGsuz: i would literally rather have fewer dungeons or zones if it lets them be more creative
[0:35:39] Xarconos: @Maximum i dislike the 1 big raid every patch. multiple raids is usually more fun
[0:35:42] Tanonn: he wants mini raids
[0:35:47] Zozohnet: launch with 20 dungeons and no raid yolo
[0:35:48] Volders1993: isn’t it nice to know what you’re going into in a way though?
[0:35:51] guynormally: just switch up the numbers. 8 raids, 4 dungeons, 1 zone xdd
[0:35:51] ChefTinyT: the biggest problem for me is like, you get a legendary one patch and its useless the next that feels real bad
[0:35:55] reggiepowa: its bad in wow but in ff14, the most formulaic game ever, he would love it
[0:35:55] noirlol: spice things up, give us some 2 boss content or something i dunno
[0:35:56] chubbytheboi: I want mini raids too
[0:35:57] JayPuppa: Any healers interested in progging Mythic Tindral tonight? 8p-11p EST - DM me your IGN.
[0:35:58] Pyrrha_GG: that feels like a "you think you do but you dont" with not wanting those things
[0:36:00] fokare: it’s more variation, multiple small raids or 1 boss raids or something new
[0:36:07] Reticen: wow was not seasonal at start,it should trun back to it roots
[0:36:07] XadanarGaming: A "Mini" Raid would be kinda sick i think in a .5 patch with 2-3 bosses that is just something fun to blast with a few of the homies
[0:36:10] BipolarPongal: @JayPuppa OMEGALUL
[0:36:12] faythes68: doesn't this go together with the prt/never not spoiled thing?
[0:36:18] Piki9: Legion had new dungeons, extra small raids, mage tower - more variation is the take @maximum
[0:36:18] Gorakk82: they should have to its an mmo
[0:36:21] AlphasaurusRexx: @reggiepowa he played it for a while and came back to wow
[0:36:23] zukohonor: gear is boring
[0:36:24] Gorakk82: i agree there
[0:36:26] Blazzerx: thats how it was in TBC
[0:36:27] HeffaBear: why not? it extends your content and they get to se the old raids
[0:36:28] JayPuppa: @bipolarpongal :D
[0:36:28] JoaEUW: @rbgdev no i want extreme drama discussion heated drama only drama!!!
[0:36:30] Basic_3: Imagine if Grieftorch was BIS all of DF. Actual despair
[0:36:37] Kebabit0: variation is important imo - like Fated was a nice touch but don't need Fated raids all the times
[0:36:37] antipheonixna: @Maximum what if u only had like 4-6 on release and kept the others hidden to drop during patches
[0:36:42] YayFiber: OSRS gear lasts a long time but also takes 50 times longer to acquire than wow seasonal gear.
[0:36:43] ifuse: all raid during an expansion should be relevant
[0:36:48] spivet: rolling alts would be hell on earth if you had to reclear multiple old raids to be relevant
[0:36:50] HeyImNexxus: how would you feel if they added a custom forge. Where items dropped acts as "molds" or customizable assets that you can farm mats to personally customize them? think that'd be cool
[0:36:50] CaseMoney: sure but the solutions are often worse than the problem
[0:36:51] BipolarPongal: @JayPuppa I'd be happy to join literally any boss apart from that
[0:36:54] escalu: ion hazzikostas needs to go. he makes scummy game design
[0:36:57] CloudyHS: delves @Maximum
[0:36:57] Madcatmk02: @HeffaBear because people only have so many hours in a week and worrying about 3 raids is worse than 1 in a lot of situations
[0:36:57] zelrock__: Covenants Kappa
[0:37:03] heloraeon: a new dungeon
[0:37:03] 1_7_4: gotta have examples man cant be vague
[0:37:04] chubbytheboi: mini raids
[0:37:04] xii_kyle: housing
[0:37:06] Basic_3: Lol, if you can't think of anything just act mad and say "any aspect"
[0:37:06] monkeytimeee: TWO SEASONS
[0:37:07] Blazzerx: HIRE FANS
[0:37:08] Pyrrha_GG: just be CreativeTM
[0:37:09] rzocys0: this guy has not raided in 5 years, why do people give him time on wow opinons KEKW
[0:37:09] monkeytimeee: TWO SEASONZZZ
[0:37:11] CloudyHS: DELVES
[0:37:12] grozzarr: pvpve
[0:37:15] OsBlackfall: Sweet jesus this is a 47 mins video, we're gonna be here for 9 hours.
[0:37:18] vannerosenpai: They already have 2 teams working on this game LUL
[0:37:20] MapleTakes: even updates to those older ones
[0:37:20] vmaster11: brawlers guild was goated
[0:37:20] Tanonn: towers Prayge
[0:37:24] Volders1993: Need more fun fuck around shit
[0:37:26] Piki9: You've mentioned a one giga boss raid before, that would be cool
[0:37:28] jin_spear: lets see if delves closes that need
[0:37:30] noirlol: magetower +  1-2 boss raid content
[0:37:39] Baglio: @rzocys0 yes he has just not hardcore
[0:37:43] austin_545: @OsBlackfall You're free to go at any time.
[0:37:47] antipheonixna: you can technically cut the amount of dungeons and hide them till new seasons on release if we are only gonna have 4 new
[0:37:48] PriestessSio: @Maximum Id love a new dungeon each patch or a one boss raid that has gear slightly better than normal or heroic raid gear (depending on difficulty level) as a way to gain power towards the main raids
[0:37:54] thesunnyside: @Maximum I would like there to be some flexibility. Mega dungeon on release, more zones but smaller, 2 raids with less bosses. That sort of stuff
[0:37:57] CloudyHS: ?
[0:37:59] spivet: keep reading
[0:38:02] Sover31gn: He will get to the point
[0:38:03] OsBlackfall: @austin_545 yeah or don't pause the video every half second xdd
[0:38:03] Piki9: Keep reading, he has an example
[0:38:03] Basic_3: You're not stupid. That sentence is.
[0:38:03] avenira_qt: bro is aristotle
[0:38:05] huntermaster_95: LetHimJoel
[0:38:06] KaisenSiru: anniesGiggle
[0:38:06] Jirofanboy: Taking a while keep reading
[0:38:10] gertsferd: It's cookie cutter repeat of the same shit over and over
[0:38:11] muonz: hes just saying sometimes lore might mean a 1 boss raid is fine to implement, but they dont do that
[0:38:12] BipolarPongal: I have a 200 word essay due tomorrow and I'm here watching this xdd
[0:38:18] PurpleKami: This post has no fucking idea how long a zone takes to mke
[0:38:20] Lrauq: maybe lore enjoyers aren't hot on there being 5 throwaway whomegalul bosses a raid
[0:38:23] txrb: weve procced comprehensive reading skills
[0:38:25] valdekius: What I would really like is a way to gear up to top tier gear that isn't just m+ or raid. I would really love a more traditional dungeon experience where you don't have to rush through and can still gain top tier gear
[0:38:25] vannerosenpai: cata
[0:38:27] e1d0t: very convoluted post lol
[0:38:28] eisen_rs: i liked the little 1-3 boss raids
[0:38:29] The_Boctor: kinda happened in mop too
[0:38:29] Madcatmk02: Cata sucked at the beginning so
[0:38:31] StarShopping95: @BipolarPongal 200 is like two paragraphs? uuh
[0:38:31] Vynarel: Bastion and Blackwing
[0:38:31] Floundur: bastion of twilight
[0:38:31] RigatonyTV: cata raids were dope
[0:38:32] MachaObv: so far saying "less cookie cutter mmo pls" ?
[0:38:32] CloudyHS: the way it is, is fine right now
[0:38:32] Volders1993: Bastion of Twilight
[0:38:33] JackOfAllApocalypses: 200 words is a paragraph, not an essay
[0:38:34] ICitizenErasedI: he's saying maybe your story might be appropriate for a 3 boss arc rather than an entire raid tier etc
[0:38:36] Line_0: I wouldn't mind it changing around
[0:38:36] spivet: mean dragon time
[0:38:37] natureza88: the post is getting to it
[0:38:39] uncred95: bastion of twilight and throne of the 4 winds
[0:38:40] KaisenSiru: MoP too, with Vaults, Heart of Fear, and Terrace
[0:38:40] Basic_3: Twilight, 4 thrones, descent
[0:38:40] huntermaster_95: T11, first tier of Cata was amazing
[0:38:41] targus92dd: zones? like quest zones?
[0:38:42] leubinator: @BipolarPongal perfect just copy the way the guy typed a lot of words without saying much
[0:38:43] MapleTakes: I liked that breakdown honestly
[0:38:45] thesunnyside: first tier of cata was Pog
[0:38:45] guynormally: @BipolarPongal you only need 30 seconds for 200 words
[0:38:46] JayPuppa: They did that in WOTLK too - the sanctums etc.
[0:38:46] Gapplebees1: I'd love to have a few 1-2 boss raids sprinkled in mid season or something
[0:38:50] Robohobbo: They could literally make 1 zone that has a lot of cool quests, gets you to max level and focus on more dungeons or raids and that would be great.
[0:38:51] Piki9: 2/3 raids would be cool every now and again @maximum
[0:38:51] vannerosenpai: so whats different having one huge raid or 3 little raids?
[0:38:53] noirlol: hes right about 1-2boss raids
[0:38:53] Vynarel: it was like 1 raid split 3 times
[0:38:54] YoFrankFrost: @BipolarPongal So you have to send a text as an essay?? 200 words? lol
[0:38:54] Gorakk82: My biggest issue with his whole take is just make it all easier.  There are 4 difficulties (which is an issue, we only need 3) People dont need the highest ilvl loot.  U still get to see the content even if you never step into mythic.  Asmon's argument completely ingnores that because he needs the shiny.
[0:38:54] Emerphish: lowkey throwback to BRD in classic being the biggest and weirdest sprawling dungeon where you didn't even do most of it every time you went there. that was lit
[0:38:55] Floundur: kinda loved those tho tbh
[0:38:56] vmaster11: but thats fine
[0:38:57] Sover31gn: But it felt different ig, it was a long time ago tho
[0:38:58] Morayeden: I'd be fine with it.
[0:38:58] talkley: all same tier
[0:38:59] UltraDankNooner: wasmt sinestra a secret boss?
[0:38:59] faythes68: 1 and a half at most
[0:39:00] uncred95: there was also baradin hold
[0:39:01] Robohobbo: The problem with zones is that 90% of them are irrelevant
[0:39:02] Regroot_Gaming: 3 raids per expansion IS NOT ENOUGH PERIOD , we need 5-6 raids per expansion if the expansion lasts for 2 years.
[0:39:04] wintexx: @Maximum how would you enjoy having two raids open at the same time with two linear 5 boss raids u gotta fight, and like a pointer by blizz for which houses the biggest bad endboss for the patch
[0:39:05] noirlol: keep reading, hes gonna finish his point
[0:39:06] vmaster11: it just feels different
[0:39:07] BipolarPongal: ICANT
[0:39:07] forshard: That's fine. It feels like variety
[0:39:08] whisperwow: next paragraph, max
[0:39:10] corgio1318: Shadowlands had 5 areas at the start
[0:39:11] txrb: same bro, i got a 200 word essay due next week and i havent even started it ICANT
[0:39:12] Kawatteruwow: that would be great to pug too
[0:39:16] Thdlock: make it a grey box like xavius baseg
[0:39:16] soviet_kapitalist: same content, 3 x the running. no thanks
[0:39:17] zannuss: But thats what he is talking about.
[0:39:18] Melithian: People want that, though. Different themes, different areas.
[0:39:19] Zozohnet: that is good, you get variety
[0:39:23] HeffaBear: they could stand on their own as if they were at least 2 raids
[0:39:23] Owlskees: but art is what blizz is good at, use it
[0:39:26] heloraeon: @Maximum  didn't they say they have more people then ever working on the game so they can develop two expansions at the same time?
[0:39:29] xii_kyle: lmfaooo
[0:39:31] willpow2: I really like that
[0:39:32] thegrt13: its easier/more fun to pug one to three boss raids. than pugging a whole 9 boss raid
[0:39:34] Tanonn: @Thdlock baseg
[0:39:36] freehawk1: Maybe we could get more raids faster if they use AI generation for the art
[0:39:37] BipolarPongal: Maybe I just copy paste this thread EZ
[0:39:38] vmaster11: i would love it
[0:39:38] Zynneh: @Thdlock My FPS agrees
[0:39:38] spivet: they definitely reused art assets in amirdassil
[0:39:38] ampliDude7: how are there 3 people getting got by the 200 word essay Jebaited
[0:39:41] PurpleKami: @Owlskees it takes a massive amount of time to make
[0:39:42] whisperwow: i meant next paragraph explains what you're talking about xD, not rushing you
[0:39:42] Osterberg501: The start of Cata was pretty sick. Getting some smaller raids would be cool.
[0:39:46] vannerosenpai: @Regroot_Gaming they released 3 raids in 12 months with df
[0:39:48] XadanarGaming: A "Mini" Raid would be kinda sick i think in a .5 patch with 2-3 bosses that is just something fun to blast with a few of the homies to help bridge season/tiers 10 or 15man
[0:39:50] e1d0t: @Zozohnet yes but it takes like 6 months longer to make 3 zones then 1. do you want each tier to be a year?
[0:39:52] forshard: Imagine Raid 1 is ez, raid 2 is medium and raid 3 is RWF tier hard
[0:39:55] RigatonyTV: didnt mist have 3 raids at the beginning?
[0:39:57] lieutenantdan416: blizz is good at art in comparison to what exactly lol
[0:39:59] Altairian8: coming from wrath classic, the lore themed dungeons kind of fuck everything, having a very short raid sandwiched between 2 long raids made the final raid a total pain to motivate people to do
[0:40:00] targus92dd: 3 raids at once, lol gl finding ppl  that knows all boss dances
[0:40:00] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: then why they dont do ity ?
[0:40:02] zannuss: Why is it that everything can be resolved in one location or why can't we tackle multiple on going issues that end in separate raids
[0:40:05] arzibi: I loved raiding Obsidian Sanctum on a slow day. It also allowed our guild at the time to test alts/new players in a 1-boss raid
[0:40:06] Krontr: mr thd whats the lock m+ spec atm
[0:40:06] Robohobbo: Wait
[0:40:08] sirch1: mini-raids would be fun though, we had those before, i dont know what problem they caused to remove them?
[0:40:09] Line_0: I'd be fine if they reused some more assets to make these things
[0:40:13] CloudyHS: yes
[0:40:14] Blazzerx: they can AI generate that
[0:40:19] noirlol: @sirch1 ye love mini raids
[0:40:22] reggiepowa: they are reusing art though, nokhud, algethar, brackenhide are all part of the open world zones
[0:40:22] uncred95: most of them left
[0:40:23] Trodenskjold: @RigatonyTV No. It was the same tier, but not release tat the same time
[0:40:23] zukohonor: the art could be good, but doesnt mean anything if the content is boring "the new zones"
[0:40:24] PurpleKami: @Blazzerx -1 iq take
[0:40:24] Jirofanboy: @Blazzerx LOL
[0:40:27] gwenmh: pups are still popping off, it’s been 30 mins guys
[0:40:30] silent_tv1: if you have 3 raids released together how do you decide on difficulty and pacing? would there be a correct way of doing them?
[0:40:31] BipolarPongal: Blizzard CAUGHT
[0:40:31] CrimsonSun88: SC beat Cerus
[0:40:32] Bryyo: keep pausing max! Watch at your own pace king!
[0:40:35] Nox1o: proletariat? thats just working class
[0:40:38] vmaster11: Onyxia was goated
[0:40:40] rzocys0: 1 or 2 boss raids are boring af
[0:40:42] noirlol: really?
[0:40:43] galifax2: wasnt the 2 boss raid in bfa bad or something
[0:40:43] Vynarel: its nice to get the variety every now and then, I quite liked the first tier of cata
[0:40:44] Blazzerx: i loved those
[0:40:44] ampliDude7: they are fine but also pretty forgettable
[0:40:44] MeisterChiefX: trial of valor seemed pretty well received
[0:40:45] Robohobbo: Is the art also why new spells don't often come up? Or why some specs dont get new spec effects/art?
[0:40:46] zannuss: crucible
[0:40:48] CaseMoney: mag was a good one
[0:40:48] Jirofanboy: Yeah fck 1 and 2 boss raids
[0:40:48] galifax2: i know tov was pretty damn good
[0:40:49] zelrock__: They are often to hard
[0:40:50] Byggareebob: trial of valor was really good and crucible of storm was just badly timed
[0:40:50] Volders1993: only good one was the Valor one in Legion
[0:40:50] The_Boctor: i dont think we ever thought about it like that back then
[0:40:51] ShabsieAU: Im personally a huge fan
[0:40:51] Thdlock: tov was crucicble released at a bad time
[0:40:52] Lyonidus: crucible wasn't, most other were
[0:40:52] JackOfAllApocalypses: the odyn/helya raid was good
[0:40:52] vannerosenpai: The one in bfa is the least played raid ever
[0:40:52] battlenetq: the Doggoss
[0:40:53] cesartcab: crucible was really good tbh
[0:40:54] Trodenskjold: I loved Crucible
[0:40:55] Sublime: I liked that they were a smaller time commitment
[0:40:56] spivet: those dogs are DOGGIN
[0:40:56] Blazzerx: dog fight monkaS
[0:40:57] yuhkz: ToV was great though
[0:40:57] JackOfAllApocalypses: trial of valor yeah
[0:40:58] chaosreaper0: people didn't like 1 to 2 boss raids
[0:40:59] vmaster11: thats a timing issue
[0:41:02] MeisterChiefX: crucible was set up to fail
[0:41:03] FieldMedic_Feywyn: That sounds hard to tune. You would either need it to be very difficult or super easy.
[0:41:06] Osterberg501: 1 boss raids not great, but small raids like 3 bosses is sick.
[0:41:06] Morayeden: CoS was sick AF
[0:41:07] Jnxz: crucible
[0:41:07] Kawatteruwow: and it was too hard
[0:41:07] whitexscale: Doggos want more raids
[0:41:08] Hej_Benny: Dogs popping off monkaS
[0:41:08] Madcatmk02: Trial was great
[0:41:09] tunaman508: woof
[0:41:11] thesunnyside: Trial of Valor was awesome
[0:41:12] battlenetq: dalmatias is pumping
[0:41:13] battlenetq: top dps
[0:41:14] zamow1994: trial of valor was way too hard
[0:41:15] EmpyreanZenith: Reptar is a menace
[0:41:15] trevor_sub: TOV was amazing
[0:41:15] Volders1993: Trial of Valor was sick
[0:41:16] FieldMedic_Feywyn: I mean 9 boss raids take only a few weeks to push through.
[0:41:16] CloudyHS: TOV was dogshit
[0:41:16] StarShopping95: doggoArrive
[0:41:17] Blazzerx: D:
[0:41:17] Pyrrha_GG: i think people dont realize how many decisions the blizz makes have been driven by engagement numbers that only blizz has
[0:41:17] battlenetq: TOP DPS
[0:41:18] Cjpriest: blizzards timing is shit they could make it work if they paid attention
[0:41:18] Artheeri: repar wants to fight 2 danes KEKW
[0:41:19] spivet: reptar getting evicted
[0:41:20] BipolarPongal: Liquid Helya CAUGHT

[0:41:24] othernewname: dawg
[0:41:26] targus92dd: 1 mini boss for dps check could be fun, like a raid dummy for meter gamers

[0:41:46] Morayeden: Crucible was fun. Def should do more of that
[0:41:47] Blackeye1992: chair stream lets go
[0:41:47] Elseworldz: "cmon dogs" and they all just follow him. Awesome
[0:41:47] thegrt13: @Cjpriest paid attention to what?
[0:41:50] stenpotatis: rip
[0:41:50] battlenetq: can i pet that dawg>
[0:41:51] Draycop: @talkley yea playing 10 shamans sounds enjoyable
[0:41:51] ThisIzD: Fronk leave this shit in.
[0:41:54] Volders1993: They had to nerf ToV quite quickly if I recall.
[0:41:54] Hej_Benny: o7
[0:41:57] RenegadeHeals: smaller raid means way more likely that youre just not gonna progress any of these bosses in favor of another player
[0:41:57] reggiepowa: taking the dogs to the snow and rain outside Sadge
[0:41:59] whisperwow: o7 Doggos
[0:42:00] FieldMedic_Feywyn: 1-2 boss raids sounds hard to tune.
[0:42:03] Shadowst3p9: Reptar got that dawg in him
[0:42:05] cyarinn_: dannnng dawg jail is ruff
[0:42:06] noirlol: normal/heroic/mythic mini-raid, sounds goated
[0:42:10] Piki9: Would maybe introducing a 1-2 boss raid a couple months after a raid release, with new loot, be a way to naturally nerf the end wall bosses of the main raid? @maximum
[0:42:14] MeisterChiefX: ruby sanctum was problematic in multiple ways
[0:42:16] Dzor12: dawg
[0:42:17] Volders1993: RS sucked, only did that for the Arpen trinket
[0:42:17] talkley: @Draycop playing 10 of the best class in the game? hell yeah brother
[0:42:20] zannuss: ruby sanctum was odd
[0:42:21] BipolarPongal: Dorki got that dawg in him too
[0:42:22] spivet: wrath was prime nostalgia time for me when I started playing and I could not name a single thing that happened in ruby snactum
[0:42:22] Rusken_: RS was trash because it was just filler
[0:42:33] Isolol: ruby sanctum didn't really fit either
[0:42:36] slap__nation: slap__nation subscribed with Prime. 
[0:42:38] ampliDude7: RS was oly there to fill time between expansions
[0:42:45] TheSabin: dawg that emote is bis
[0:42:46] ShowDUH: @Piki9 this would become a new wall in the same tier just by itself
[0:42:55] JoaEUW: Isnt it honestly a little crazy thinking that having 8 bosses in one raid and then 1 raid with 1-2 bosses would make the game better
[0:42:58] BipolarPongal: xddShrug
[0:43:04] JoaEUW: sounds uinspiring
[0:43:04] Basic_3: ... but why do that instead of a 10 boss raid?
[0:43:05] forshard: Did he just reference 2007?
[0:43:08] Basic_3: What's the difference?
[0:43:09] alvesol: yes and no
[0:43:09] spivet: you can tell this GM has written some business emails, he's got the lingo down pat
[0:43:10] StarShopping95: It's double the work model wise
[0:43:11] wintexx: giga race
[0:43:12] cookie2505: 1-3 boss raids were fucking awesome
[0:43:17] zannuss: Not from a story point of view
[0:43:17] rzocys0: hes acting like he would start playing if they did that KEKW
[0:43:17] CloudyHS: theres no difference between a 10 boss raid
[0:43:18] ShowDUH: i mean its litterally the same thing you prog the easier one first
[0:43:19] Goodnevi1: I think they went for mega dungeons over two small raids
[0:43:19] Lyonidus: 2 endgame bosses 2 penultimate bosses
[0:43:19] VinsanityGG: more time travelling between raids, less time fighting bosses
[0:43:20] Blazzerx: its a change
[0:43:20] Line_0: You can do two themes I guess
[0:43:22] Dyez: it doesn't mean anything
[0:43:22] Harry_barry_larry: two end bosses vs. 1
[0:43:23] pflipz: it could be cool to do every once in while and might make a fun story
[0:43:25] BipolarPongal: FLASHBANG
[0:43:26] MeisterChiefX: its different thematically at the very least
[0:43:27] bigoldmeatpie: it changes the scenery
[0:43:31] Boreall: The person that posted this wants retail to be Classic, I love both versions of the game but Retail should never be anything like Classic
[0:43:31] othernewname: Then ppl complain, too much content at once to do in a week lol
[0:43:31] Nickystr1x: RWF would be weird if there were 2 short raids at the same time
[0:43:31] faythes68: if its at the same time its the same as current yes
[0:43:32] BullZhot: BullZhot subscribed with Prime. 
[0:43:32] Owlskees: muh ads
[0:43:32] misran: the last time we had a 2 boss raid nobody did it.  obv the timing was bad but that probably influenced their decision
[0:43:32] baraborat: It could tell different stories for those that care instead of just one
[0:43:36] Syghtless: but amirdrassil has liek  3 different vibes and zones? @Maximum
[0:43:37] Sover31gn: Well you have two themes in Amirdrassil
[0:43:39] Line_0: They could also tune for 2 end bosses, instead of 1
[0:43:41] Melithian: Change of scenery is nice
[0:43:43] spinnie: back in tbc, it just fit, so many stories going on, they needed the multiple raids to tell them all iirc
[0:43:44] guynormally: if it's 2 end bosses then I guess that's neat
[0:43:45] grozzarr: add a giant raid boss to the middle of eye of the storm
[0:43:47] ThisIsAsabel: his point is about lore, so having 2 different raid is maybe sometimes interesting for story and atmosphere
[0:43:50] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite devoNOTE
[0:43:50] Ritashi2: It could be cool in a story sense only, doesn't matter otherwise
[0:43:51] spinnie: I loved magtheridon tho
[0:43:52] Piki9: @showduh I guess maybe the 1-2 boss raid would be smolderon difficulty, to help deal with tindal and smolderon in the main raid - just a thought to address balancing the giga bosses
[0:43:53] Gritalian: Would this really matter? The top players are so efficient they'd work out the "proper" path. It being different raid portals is just additional travel time
[0:43:53] heloraeon: watch he's going to draw butts again
[0:43:54] targus92dd: 78 bosses?
[0:43:54] Pyrrha_GG: i think they want a greater variety of themes and lore, where from a game play perspective it doesn't matter
[0:43:57] whisperwow: i think by creative - he means "creative narrative" exploring different storylines at the same time.
[0:44:02] jesuslouise: it adds a lot of work for not as much value to have 2 smaller raids
[0:44:02] Line_0: 2 end bosses though
[0:44:03] Osterberg501: two 5 boss raids would take a lot more work than 1 10 boss raid. That's the big reason why.
[0:44:11] dobi_gg: @spivet :)
[0:44:14] codydoubleu: it would be a novelty at first but at a point i feel like players would not enjoy being suprised/left guessing. not every suprise can be good
[0:44:16] soviet_kapitalist: same number of bosses. more running, no thanks
[0:44:23] Volders1993: I think having two to switch it up a bit is pretty cool. I’m sick of trees now
[0:44:25] swiftiie02: in my opinion is good for guilds,  imagine amirdrasil, u extend thje last 2 bosses for months, imagine the first 7 bosses are 1 raid, the last 2 are 1 raid, u can extend on fyrrak but farm the inicial ones
[0:44:25] Piki9: @showduh but yeah, true, guess all about what difficulty they are aiming for
[0:44:27] Franiio: give us 10 man raid back :D
[0:44:30] sirch1: @Osterberg501 nobody is asking for 2 5 man raids though
[0:44:32] CloudyHS: its the same
[0:44:32] BipolarPongal: @dobi_gg I'm gonna use this for my essay TriHard
[0:44:35] Jazzarus_: if the two raids are the same in terms of difficulty and the theme is cool, then yes, it's vastly different. Plus, clearing is faster, and easier to form groups
[0:44:36] trevor_sub: you would get less burn out imo
[0:44:37] PurpleKami: you need to make a second raid worth of environment art
[0:44:38] Blazzerx: its a nice change of pace atleast
[0:44:40] ShabsieAU: it FEELS different though
[0:44:41] Weebeez: Two raids me you can extend 1 lock out and farm the other.
[0:44:43] Lyonidus: idk i really liked tier 11
[0:44:43] BigCizzle: for story stuff i guess
[0:44:43] spivet: gonna circle back to you after I follow up with my team
[0:44:45] jin_spear: only makes sense if its to curb their situation of dropping stories. otherwise its a waste of resources business side
[0:44:46] umbruh15: @maximum I think it's more to switch raids each patch more than keep it one style.  So patch 1 has 2  raid with 5 bosses, next patch 1 raid with your 7-9 bosses and the final raid of the expac be like ur 10+ bosses, instead of always being the same each exact  @maximum
[0:44:46] Boreall: Not a great question
[0:44:47] just_ie: Its just a lorewalker take. They just want the gnarlroots to be cut from the tier so they can see more smolderon esque lore. For gameplay it doesnt matter, but its just a chore for the art and lore department
[0:44:49] GreenSectorA: i think even with unique boss areas you spend a lot of time killing trash in the same area. its nice to just change to zone you are raiding in sometimes.
[0:44:51] heloraeon: should we get a cats opinion on this?
[0:44:52] Basic_3: They did this in TBC so obviously it's smart Kappa
[0:44:52] ShowDUH: It's purely on the art side lol
[0:44:56] DonDabon: in ssc and tk that they gave example to it was equally hard/almost impossible before nerfs
[0:44:57] Line_0: It's more fun with scenery changing as well tbh
[0:45:01] leubinator: pugging 2 raids sounds worse than pugging 1 raid
[0:45:01] DonDabon: so it could be 2 very hard end bosses
[0:45:02] Blazzerx: asmon is never gonna like WoW again no matter what blizz does
[0:45:03] Robohobbo: But isn't that what happened in Sepulcher? Anduin was supposed to be a last boss.
[0:45:10] swiftiie02: in my opinion is good for guilds, imagine amirdrasil, u extend thje last 2 bosses for months, imagine the first 7 bosses are 1 raid, the last 2 are 1 raid, u can extend on fyrrak but farm the inicial ones
[0:45:14] zannuss: I think he wants it more from a story perspective, like SSC and TK were both tier 5, but resolved 2 different story lines that were ongoing.
[0:45:14] dobi_gg: @BipolarPongal lmk what grade you get
[0:45:15] antipheonixna: would u be upset if one wing release 6 bosses and they are slightly easier than like tindril etc. but then couple weeks second wing comes out 6 bosses but they are harder?
[0:45:16] Piki9: He played all through legion and bfa @maximum
[0:45:16] noirlol: 8y ago, yes
[0:45:21] JoaEUW: This is just some people bored talk, i guess i just dont have the imagination to make 1-2 boss raids awesome
[0:45:22] shinta__: it doesn't do anything
[0:45:22] CloudyHS: it doesnt
[0:45:23] freehawk1: Asmond isn't playing because there isn't enough change it is not exciting anymore
[0:45:25] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[0:45:27] ShowDUH: @Line_0 but that's just more ressources spent for no gain at all
[0:45:28] GameteTV: yes it does
[0:45:30] olihob: he makes everything a big deal
[0:45:31] chubbytheboi: Who told Dobi we are discussing Asmon discussing him??
[0:45:32] Thdlock: TRUE
[0:45:34] Thdlock: AND REAL
[0:45:35] BipolarPongal: @dobi_gg well written, though. thanks, King BASED
[0:45:38] Zozohnet: just dont want the game to be stale
[0:45:39] doncrackle: He played all the way to season 2 of dragonflight @maximum
[0:45:41] Boreall: This post also references Mag, Gruul and Kara and that was widely seen as one of the WORST patches in TBC
[0:45:43] rzocys0: who the fuck cares about LORE KEKW
[0:45:46] Blazzerx: L OMEGALUL RE
[0:45:48] uncred95: D4 BAD
[0:45:51] TheSabin: WideTHD
[0:45:51] dobi_gg: @chubbytheboi everyone
[0:45:54] smashiii123: It would feel soooooo bad to have different raids and the needing to switch raid for the next progress boss. It just doesn't fit anymore into new wow.
[0:45:55] misran: @rzocys0 blizzard does, that's why he's bringing it up
[0:45:55] Lyonidus: i don't think most people would care
[0:45:56] surpriseparty20: Asmons take about content is that it's too formulaic . He doesn't like the seasonal aspect too
[0:45:57] Tedrie: he mythic tanked eternal palace and his guild got famed slayer for azshara and nzoth
[0:45:58] spinnie: that was the biggest drive behind the split in raids in tbc lol, lore
[0:46:00] Draycop: they can make the lore however they want??? that doesnt make any sense
[0:46:08] ThisIsAsabel: It would, for lore, be more interesting to have multiple raids and thematics than just "6 months Sylvanas-is-bad" patch
[0:46:09] vannerosenpai: you can have magtheridon and gruul in one big raid LUL
[0:46:14] CloudyHS: CAUGHT
[0:46:15] Line_0: @showduh I mean if we are talking lore, scenery, theme etc then yeah it's worth. If all you want is to be super efficient then no it will never be worth
[0:46:16] spivet: still mad about when that hat got broken tbh
[0:46:20] chubbytheboi: @dobi_gg damn snitches
[0:46:24] Robohobbo: yeah dragonflight
[0:46:27] AlphasaurusRexx: He's saying the content in the game should not be singularly tied to lore and to allow it branch away from the lore open creativity @Maximum
[0:46:28] Lyonidus: i feel that is something they could only do for a first tier of an expansion
[0:46:28] HeiroGaming: @dobi_gg you gonna react to Max reacting to Asmongold reacting to your post?
[0:46:33] sirch1: The smaller raids are more accessible for the casual player, because you dont have to dedicate as much time to one individual raid
[0:46:34] targus92dd: lore.. who cares. read a book
[0:46:39] Line_0: @showduh personally I'm bored of everything being super efficient
[0:46:41] ICitizenErasedI: one issue i can see right away is that people won't add it up as "equivalent" to a tier - they'll go "that was a nice snack now where's my proper raid"
[0:46:45] jin_spear: they always can cuz side stories usually are a palate cleanse kinda deal
[0:46:46] talkley: only way it would kinda work is release one part and then wait a month than release the second part?
[0:46:51] Halt57: they've been trying to do that with megadungeons lately
[0:46:51] Sover31gn: Well they make the lore like that because they make 1 raid
[0:46:53] Dyez: something it could do is give you access to an end dungeon boss without having to go throught a whole raid
[0:46:53] prestonrayne: 100% should of killed Iridikron this xpac in like a 2 boss raid
[0:46:54] Sover31gn: Not the vice versa
[0:46:54] FieldMedic_Feywyn: They had a 2 boss raid in bfa nad it was nt good.
[0:46:58] Jirofanboy: It is more because of the rise of lich king like casual see the big bad
[0:47:00] d0mezg4mer: I would bet crucible saw low participation so they decided not worth doing anymore
[0:47:00] SamMFJackson: could always have the big bad guy, and then u fight two of his LT's for each raid
[0:47:03] CloudyHS: Dentge
[0:47:10] ThisIsAsabel: it matters imo simply because we get used to the format and progressively bored with it
[0:47:17] penfold01: me: “the retail storyline makes no sense” also me: “they should try to tell two stories at once”
[0:47:17] PurpleKami: vanilla? variety? what
[0:47:23] faythes68: anduin was a decent lore-sparkled fight, all his mechs made sense
[0:47:24] BipolarPongal: true
[0:47:28] Basic_3: Hard world bosses would be *terrible*
[0:47:29] Elswango: isn't Dobi trying to make a point about the lore? to give examples, we never did anything with the decay gnolls in dragonflight or the drustvar from bfa or ardenweald. we could have had small raids to tie up some of those things.
[0:47:29] CloudyHS: who the fuck wants hard world bosses
[0:47:30] Volders1993: But it did tie into the lore, it just wasn’t as accessible
[0:47:30] ShowDUH: nobody care about world boss
[0:47:31] chaosreaper0: fucking vanilla
[0:47:32] give_me_a_1_in_chat: because retail isnt an mmo anymore
[0:47:34] Artheeri: hard world bosses is something you can ask in 2004
[0:47:35] vannerosenpai: hard world bosses LUL
[0:47:39] reggiepowa: fluff
[0:47:40] arzibi: hard world bosses is a bad take
[0:47:40] misran: we got a hard world boss in mop, it didn't work out well xdd
[0:47:41] mekks_: classic andy
[0:47:43] Sothis_best_girl: @Maximum people would 100% complain about there being no lore connection if they did that LUL
[0:47:47] MeisterChiefX: world bosses cant realistically exist
[0:47:48] Thdlock: bozja baseg
[0:47:51] Greannan: Oondata
[0:47:52] Vynarel: yeah world bosses are dead content cause you can just overwhelm them
[0:47:53] BipolarPongal: blud wanted to fill in that word count
[0:47:53] Rafix1301: Hard world bosses would suck hard
[0:47:53] rottisxd: oondasta
[0:47:55] Blazzerx: @misran i enjoyed those
[0:47:57] Jazzarus_: world bosses are stupid in every game
[0:47:57] Line_0: Hard world bosses will never happen I feel like
[0:47:59] reggiepowa: thid GIGACHAD
[0:48:01] KaisenSiru: Oondasta Pog
[0:48:01] Lyonidus: a lot of those mini raids did have massively important pieces of lore
[0:48:02] codydoubleu: hard world bosses would be killed for 2 weeks and abandoned
[0:48:02] Tanonn: WAR
[0:48:04] zannuss: A hard world boss would just be a single boss raid then
[0:48:04] Kebabit0: hard world bosses only to play it at 12FPS
[0:48:05] noirlol: bozja baseg
[0:48:06] JakeParkbench: If its hard you just bring more dudes, and then more geared dudes
[0:48:07] holmat: Then they have to drop good loot
[0:48:07] cabita31: ahah was just thinking about that
[0:48:08] ColdIceCreamMan: either they are just damage sponges that can be zerged down or they are free kills. can't have any complexitry
[0:48:10] JoaEUW: But how would this work for RTWF and for heroic raiders? Do they clear 3/5 of one raid and kill 1/1 and 1/1 of the other raids? or is everything just super hard or
[0:48:11] cabita31: the number of wipes on that
[0:48:12] Gritalian: servers can't even handle world bosses with 1 mechanic
[0:48:12] cabita31: ahaha
[0:48:15] Lrauq: GIGACHAD corpse run raid
[0:48:16] gwenmh: oondasta my beloved
[0:48:17] Greannan: The 5 min respawn timer cause the whole realm was bricked
[0:48:19] Zynneh: 150 players Vs oondasda Pog
[0:48:20] Ardal_Obe: Sha was pretty hard in MoP because of the griefers
[0:48:21] Chrisd1991: nah bro oondasta was hella fun
[0:48:22] Nox1o: hard wordlbosses arent good because the worldboss meta is to just hit it and afk
[0:48:22] Milano___: Agreed. Hard world bosses make no sense
[0:48:22] deadly0peratingsystem: guild wars 2 did it
[0:48:25] eazye812: bozja baseg
[0:48:26] Thdlock: bozja baseg
[0:48:27] Robohobbo: Imagine Fyraak mythic on world boss
[0:48:29] snowfloofy: red chocobo in bozja xdd
[0:48:32] waelrick: loot pinatas
[0:48:32] ParagonFV: separate raids at the same time would be nice because it would function as a separate mythic lockout i guess
[0:48:32] KTher: loot pinaas
[0:48:33] Robohobbo: actual cancer
[0:48:34] Propagationz: bozja baseg
[0:48:34] Isolol: first oondasta kill on proudmoore-us KEKW
[0:48:36] XandeRolampago: That's just Guild Wars 2
[0:48:39] megatin: How do you make a world boss that's hard for mythic raiders but doable on smaller servers?
[0:48:39] ghar__: the servers can barely handle more than 40 players hitting a world boss xd
[0:48:42] baddecisiondanx: the diablo world bosses weren't hard but were fun
[0:48:49] gwenmh: that maldraxxas world boss farmed as well
[0:48:51] BipolarPongal: most council bosses are dogshit
[0:48:56] Jazzarus_: infinite if you have imagination
[0:48:56] StarShopping95: When was the last good council boss? Nathria?
[0:48:57] Boreall: First of all, yes we always need a Patchwerk boss
[0:48:58] Sothis_best_girl: @Maximum GW2 has some decent world boss design tbh, but they're like, entire zones
[0:48:59] Avulsionn: are ff14 bosses more varied? i know its a diff game i guess
[0:49:00] TheItalianStallion321: as many as you want, be creative
[0:49:01] dika93: i hate council type bosses
[0:49:02] filos0phia: Itt leads into the UI discussion. A Better UI would help mitigate the coordination issue
[0:49:02] CloudyHS: what a weird cpmplaint
[0:49:03] dorki: patchwerk is fine council is not
[0:49:03] Niroggo: ultraxion GIGACHAD
[0:49:03] HeiroGaming: Does he want every boss to be Painsmith?
[0:49:03] Faraday5001: every patchwerk boss bangs
[0:49:05] pixhrlol: Id prefer more gimmick bosses from time to time, add in a whacky ass minigame mid fight
[0:49:06] Artheeri: true we need more Eonars if you ask me xdd
[0:49:06] ChefTinyT: patchwork bosses are just fun
[0:49:06] dullermanjaro: not many if ur not creative and good at ur job
[0:49:09] prestonrayne: @BipolarPongal nice opinion :)
[0:49:09] BigCizzle: Madge dont take my pw bosses away
[0:49:10] kiriuped: think every actual raider appreciates the low-brain activity patchwerk boss
[0:49:11] dorki: council and gimmick fights suck
[0:49:15] wademoney3590: Lets see the FF14 being formulaic react video. It wont happen
[0:49:15] PhungusTV: A boss can be good and still be uninteresting. Smolderon is a good example imo
[0:49:16] faythes68: and the answer is to make siege bosses like HFC?
[0:49:17] chubbytheboi: Just make the bosses hard, like Tindral level hard, from the get-go
[0:49:18] Chimix1: patchwoprk is fine but council bosses are more and more cringe every time
[0:49:18] comp1: a Tank and spank
[0:49:18] vindixon: Siege of Org had the best mixture of boss models
[0:49:19] whisperwow: Magmorax Lulw
[0:49:19] Boreall: Hard and fast send it is a feelsgood
[0:49:20] faythes68: kekw

[0:49:36] Cyony: I thought patchwork was just a DPS dummy  boss

[0:49:51] orkarnage: BOOGIE DOWN
[0:49:51] ItchY_val: Council of dreams is actual cancer
[0:49:51] atamdev: man council bosses are more miss than hit
[0:49:51] Volders1993: I don’t like the council bosses this expansion, they’re kind of whatever
[0:49:52] Superhank: CN was goateed
[0:49:54] whisperwow: Boogie Left
[0:49:54] nationas: quack
[0:49:55] guynormally: boogie down peepoPls
[0:49:57] PriestessSio: @CloudyHS Its not a complain, its just a hypothetical question. Just a do we  *need* this certain component everytime (insert any component of raid)
[0:49:57] chubbytheboi: @ruediruempel Yep. He is so symbolic in that way that all similar bosses are called with that name
[0:49:59] syzurup: council bosses just give devs a reason to nerf moonkins
[0:50:01] BobAwesome: i hate council bosses. they always get dots nerfed
[0:50:02] BipolarPongal: sashay left
[0:50:04] apoctheking: sashay left
[0:50:04] ChefTinyT: CN was the best
[0:50:06] Hans_Two: Bug council SOO
[0:50:09] Artheeri: shimmy right
[0:50:09] HoseiYamasaki: No more boogying down please
[0:50:11] Larshouma: There is no more gearcheck bosses, it's a joke, it's a gameplay check in Mythic and Nothing in lower difficulty.
[0:50:12] Thdlock: queens court baseg (besides the fact ranged was op)
[0:50:12] Greannan: Make them build-a-boss and possible to kill one before the others
[0:50:13] thatbassist: prance forward
[0:50:15] spicytomatooo: GW2 had a world boss that had a high fail rate until they nerfed it.
[0:50:15] Weebeez: Make encounters that need more than 2 tanks or s/t. Spice it up.
[0:50:21] jin_spear: nathria was hell and also slapped hard xd
[0:50:26] Rekill167: dawg
[0:50:27] CloudyHS: DuckerZ
[0:50:28] cawnch: quack
[0:50:29] dizzleflex: BoD Council was fine imo
[0:50:33] PurpleKami: @Weebeez woo yeah let's make raid comps even harder to manage woo!
[0:50:34] Zaisx: quack
[0:50:35] kiriuped: Duck gimmick was the biggest shitter part
[0:50:36] Robohobbo: QUACK
[0:50:36] tow996: WB during classic were fun, scouting, wiping other raids, forming alliances with guilds to farm WB
[0:50:36] ifuse: ducky AYAYA
[0:50:37] lastericalive: bug council and twin emps. two good ones in one raid
[0:50:37] Floundur: quack
[0:50:40] faythes68: or make you can still dps while being a duck
[0:50:42] BipolarPongal: classic
[0:50:44] FieldMedic_Feywyn: Council in Citadel was good.
[0:50:50] Thdlock: queens court baseg
[0:50:55] Robohobbo: QUACKJE rukiTrig rukiTrig rukiTrig
[0:50:58] antipheonixna: what if it was a council fight but they were attacking each other 5Head
[0:51:01] kiriuped: brain off go brrr yes
[0:51:04] deditto: i like council fights
[0:51:05] ChefTinyT: council can get chuffed
[0:51:06] ChefTinyT: err
[0:51:08] ChefTinyT: fucked
[0:51:08] Volders1993: I like patchwerk bosses. it’s nice to turn your brain off and go brrrr
[0:51:09] Hiear: council bosses ResidentSleeper
[0:51:09] Spartany25: peaople want to aoe, aoe = fun
[0:51:12] jandemain: what other boss types are there
[0:51:13] amperegames: what are 9/11 bosses
[0:51:14] DasAutoChat: its probarly for balance druids
[0:51:14] Steehll: We'd get more Darkwater Behemoths
[0:51:15] tomegreene: in my raid group, council boss lets different dps be good for 1 fight
[0:51:18] dullermanjaro: council in amirdrisl is the worst boss in the raid
[0:51:18] jesuslouise: yeah, they've just learned what works over the years
[0:51:18] whisperwow: another halondrus LetsGo
[0:51:20] smashiii123: Zskarn is a product of creativity
[0:51:22] JackOfAllApocalypses: yes...patchwerk needs to exist...sometimes you just want to just do your role and not think too hard
[0:51:22] DasAutoChat: so they can be good Keepo
[0:51:25] Sefirosuwar: when specs have niches like being council specs they would have to remove that if no council boses esxists.
[0:51:26] Propagationz: @amperegames monkaHmm
[0:51:26] whitexscale: The first boss, allow it to be a patchwork
[0:51:27] surpriseparty20: I think the world bosses he wants are like the ones in Vanilla that were hard like raid bosses or something idk
[0:51:36] Basic_3: Bets that his take is "I'm mad" ?
[0:51:40] CloudyHS: complaint for complaint sake
[0:51:47] faythes68: painsmith/halondrus seemed pretty creative imo
[0:51:48] PurpleKami: OMEGALUL
[0:51:50] tunaman508: I like that this is "reacting to asmon's take" but he hasnt really said anything so its really just reading along with him
[0:51:51] antipheonixna: i mean u could make 2-3 boss raids that are more casual and more out of the box
[0:52:04] Zzekar: @maximum game needs in between small raids like 2-3 bosses …
[0:52:06] PhungusTV: You have the added enjoyment of "solving" a boss that most people dont have
[0:52:06] kheim: Without seeing asmongolds reaction first, hes gonna agree with every negative point made
[0:52:15] ifuse: big true
[0:52:15] Attorneyatlawl: it’s boring, which is why I didn’t understand blizzcon announcing 3 expacs at once. oh boy, the same 4 zones, dungeons and a raid for 7 more years.
[0:52:20] HotFlatDietPepsi: WoW was kinda built on removing world bosses with them adding instances
[0:52:26] Sothis_best_girl: I mean, Mythic should be 100% cosmetic anyway, tbh
[0:52:26] Thdlock: bring back ap baseg
[0:52:29] ampliDude7: we had kurog this xpac. that boss was pretty creative even though it didnt exactly pan out
[0:52:31] Line_0: Genuinely that's a big issue I have right now
[0:52:34] BipolarPongal: WideTHD
[0:52:34] freehawk1: WideTHD Farming grants power? WideTHD
[0:52:35] daevyfan: because theres no borrowed power anymore
[0:52:35] kiriuped: @Attorneyatlawl you realize its not the same 4 zones right
[0:52:36] Madcatmk02: True @Thdlock i'll die on this hill with you
[0:52:37] Nox1o: 90% at last boss mythic? more like 99%
[0:52:37] Fun_Mo: @Thdlock NOPERS
[0:52:42] Line_0: I hate gearing up immediately and then having nothing to do
[0:52:43] PurpleKami: @Thdlock you're the only one that wants that
[0:52:43] Boreall: 6 weeks out of 36 though right
[0:52:43] weissk1ng: i miss pandaria and the worlds bosses it had in it
[0:52:45] Cakerinotv: in season two it definitely wasnt the case
[0:52:46] jesuslouise: @Thdlock classic
[0:52:48] Gorakk82: it has gotten smaller though
[0:52:48] Propagationz: @Thdlock island time LOGIN
[0:52:49] txrb: were only 3 minutes in blud it is joever
[0:52:50] flow_mein: someone redeem a global mute thd
[0:52:54] Volders1993: Do you think they’ve made gear too accessible with catalyst and vault?
[0:52:55] ItchY_val: Getting sockets the last 10 weeks is pretty ass tho
[0:52:56] trevor_sub: from the weekly box only it feels like
[0:52:58] vindixon: You are getting more powerful because of M+, not the raid
[0:52:58] BipolarPongal: HUH
[0:52:59] Madcatmk02: @Thdlock Take my sword THD
[0:53:00] lastericalive: you can cap your character by week 3 without touching raid
[0:53:03] filos0phia: Farm is the weeks leading up to tthe final boss kill, not the weeks after anymore
[0:53:06] Bollash: But you don't get crests from farm. Those come from keys
[0:53:07] Greannan: What % of CE guilds had Fyrakk killed in the first 6-7 weeks
[0:53:08] deditto: i haven't gained power for 7 weeks now im 487.88 ilvl
[0:53:08] AGGRO___: -50k x2 KEKW
[0:53:08] codydoubleu: even if ur whole guild just adds a socket each week
[0:53:12] Line_0: I haven't had an upgrade in months almost
[0:53:13] Scoop262: compare that to 8.3 power gains though, corruption, weekly cloak, heart of azeroth
[0:53:13] tow996: @Thdlock ok
[0:53:14] Rafix1301: I'd spam some islands rn
[0:53:16] Thdlock: bring back ap baseg
[0:53:19] wowtrucker: Yes but gear didn't passively nerf tindral or fyraak
[0:53:21] daevyfan: no borrowed power + reduced ilvl between patches means less power gains during the patch
[0:53:24] HeiroGaming: How far into the season does the top 100 guilds clear CE? 6 weeks in?
[0:53:24] Bryyo: do wants Titan forging back
[0:53:24] menzlo: @maximum isn't ilvl diff between ce and WF a lot closer now?
[0:53:25] Birdmang07: I <3 crests
[0:53:31] Hiear: AP GIGACHAIR
[0:53:36] Greannan: Reclearing yeah
[0:53:43] Thdlock: u just extend forever now
[0:53:45] Thdlock: its dumb af
[0:53:45] Greannan: Theres no way you dont extendo
[0:53:45] CloudyHS: thats not what farm is tho
[0:53:47] Madcatmk02: Yeah he's talking about weeks 3 - 10 for a lot of guilds
[0:53:48] PriestessSio: Yes
[0:53:50] PhungusTV: The mid-prog reclear is a reality for way more guilds than the post-CE reclear
[0:53:50] deditto: first 7 / 4 reclears
[0:53:51] Cakerinotv: we only recleared like twice this entire tier
[0:53:53] daevyfan: @HeiroGaming depends on the tier
[0:53:54] spivet: lower level CE guilds just never reclear anymore, which is hell on earth for morale. you never kill things you just wipe
[0:53:55] Madcatmk02: extending forever is definitely CHEEKS
[0:53:56] Line_0: Hate it
[0:54:05] mangohotheman: dorki check <3
[0:54:23] BipolarPongal: dorki Bedge
[0:54:25] ifuse: crest is find but let us send stuff to alts already
[0:54:28] PurpleKami: yes it's miserable having to reclear as a 6 hour guild
[0:54:28] BobAwesome: the only reason to reclear Amirdassil was for trinkets
[0:54:30] dorki: Bedge
[0:54:36] eyeztea: extending is not problem but 700 pulls on last 2 bosses is
[0:54:38] fronkacean: @dorki Bedge
[0:54:40] antipheonixna: i feel like what really needs to happen is a smoother curve for raiders content experience over a patch, either thats stagger release, more bosses and less difficulty jumps, ilv jumps as u go through the raid or something
[0:54:40] Jjmn12: you should just have more flexibility between full extend and full reclear
[0:54:41] give_me_a_1_in_chat: when extending become the norm thats when i quit. shit is just a fucking drag
[0:54:47] Line_0: Reclearing amirdrassil sucked balls
[0:54:49] Hiear: garf
[0:54:49] Clush___: @dorki bla do this irl
[0:54:55] Thdlock: AP baseg yet again but htye wont say it
[0:54:58] Cocoabun_: bla
[0:55:02] Madcatmk02: < currently getting farmed by tswift
[0:55:04] koby80: bla
[0:55:09] fronkacean: @Thdlock the children long for the mines
[0:55:12] StarShopping95: bla
[0:55:14] dobi_gg: yea skipping an entire bad seed set in P3 is big
[0:55:15] flem_wow: but then you wall on a boss and have to just bash your heads into it until blizzard decides it's worthy of a nerf
[0:55:17] Thdlock: @Thdlock thats right
[0:55:17] faythes68: if bosses were fun to re-kill, that would help to reclear/farm
[0:55:17] ShowDUH: They could have done that litterally with the Helm Enchant, don't cap it's power
[0:55:20] PPowzer74: bla
[0:55:28] freehawk1: yeah yeah we know WF raiding is hard ;)
[0:55:29] Jjmn12: there's a 4th apoc roar? PepeLaugh
[0:55:33] spivet: but if you're a low level CE guild, your ilevel is probably close to identical on the day you pull it the first time and the day you kill
[0:55:35] Kamehameshaw: let me guess, asmon's takes are all cooked
[0:55:43] deditto: i joined this new guild and we pushing p1 fyrak just after second renc now
[0:55:46] deditto: rend*
[0:55:48] huntermaster_95: Skill difference is also a thing, WF guild's DPS are like 5% ahead of a random mythic guild, that alone shrinks the gap gear has.
[0:55:48] Gabber__: i dont necessarily agree with this. for me at least, we reached our peak gear at around smoldern w 3 nights of raiding, but before we reached that peak, clearing the raid every week got easier because of ilvl upgrades
[0:55:52] kiriuped: asmon isnt a wow player anymore so
[0:55:54] kanndle: asmon is no longer qualified to give takes on wow, since he hasnt played the recent iteration of the game
[0:56:02] XadanarGaming: @Jjmn12 Thats the immune set
[0:56:12] Baglio: @kanndle he quite literally has...lol just isn't going as hard as he used to
[0:56:13] deditto: @kanndle  100 % aggree
[0:56:16] bloodsnaill: making mechanics harder and more of them means gear will be much less valuable that’s unavoidable.
[0:56:18] Ritashi2: I think it's fair for those bosses to just be hard and people have to play well to kill them
[0:56:19] Moaklerqt: Asmon just waits to get carried once the season is on farm
[0:56:26] mrcreatine123: WHAT IF THEY ARENT DOING FATED AND THEY JUST COOKED UP A FULL RAID AND DROP IT ON US WITHOUt WARNING
[0:56:34] kiriuped: @Baglio getting carried through a heroic clear doesnt count
[0:56:42] deditto: last i saw asmon raiding he was strugggglinn in normal annd he didn't manage to finish clearing the raid
[0:56:47] PurpleKami: @mrcreatine123 damn leave some copium for the rest of us
[0:56:49] AgentWhiskeyy: and early catalyst
[0:56:51] HeiroGaming: @mrcreatine123 they'd lose money with RWF raiding
[0:56:52] forphium: also early bad vaults feel extra bad
[0:56:53] uncred95: @Baglio 1 hour at the start of every major patch is not really "playing the game"
[0:56:58] Boreall: I mean isn't this post just a "I don't like Seasonal WoW" thing? Isn't the suggestion here that you should have to play WoW for 3x longer each Season?
[0:57:01] Baglio: @kiriuped that doesn't mean he can't observe what is potentially wrong with the game, which would be the exact reason he isn't still playing though
[0:57:02] AgentWhiskeyy: catalyst is a big help too
[0:57:04] chubbytheboi: I have an idea - just lock the RWF raiders' ilvl to heroic ilvls (even if they get Mythic items) and then we will have some great, long RWFs LUL
[0:57:09] Wikedlyrics: @kanndle most people aren't qualified to give takes on anything they give takes about, grifting is more common than knowledgeable takes it's not just asmon
[0:57:09] thegrt13: I think we get gear too fast
[0:57:14] Cakerinotv: @chubbytheboi honestly based
[0:57:22] thenateo2: molten core
[0:57:26] MeisterChiefX: eternal palace
[0:57:27] Bigace1116: shadowlands?

[0:57:44] MrDread: tier sets in legion
[0:57:45] Sulm: WoD or Legion?
[0:57:45] lastericalive: legion
[0:57:46] biglonelytv: WOTLK?
[0:57:46] antipheonixna: maybe more loot per boss but higher ilv jump between bosses shruge
[0:57:48] Pyrrha_GG: bis gear from Vault?
[0:57:49] vmaster11: WOTLK
[0:57:51] Luckycharms45: BFA? Put ur hands in the air?
[0:57:51] Elswango: there has been a few trinkets from BFA, but not the rest of it
[0:57:51] siremoualbou: Old warrior soul of SL was fkn OP
[0:57:52] deditto: MOP ?
[0:57:52] Floydhawk_: BFA eternal palace with font of power
[0:57:53] JaKeBoTLuL: since before the fire nation attacked
[0:57:54] Line_0: Legion for sure I think
[0:57:54] LogBro: legion
[0:57:54] ThisIsAsabel: basically before M+
[0:57:55] mavrikbtw: cata/wrath
[0:57:55] straifulove: mop
[0:57:55] ThisIsAsabel: and vault
[0:57:56] muonz: trinkets in bfa like font of power
[0:57:57] Madcatmk02: Nighthold into Tomb I think
[0:57:58] caldricus: having full gear helps a bit with splits
[0:57:58] Halt57: Old warriors soul was pretty cracked
[0:57:59] cassd32: EP because of the trinkets
[0:57:59] Elswango: font of power right?
[0:58:00] cobaltheal: eggnog's trinket
[0:58:03] Faraday5001: the ilvl jump this tier was WAY too fuckin high
[0:58:06] Khorvan: What if raid gear had special powerful effects that are only active in raid? Makes raid gear worth it to raiders without forcing M+ers into raid
[0:58:09] kheim: The "small" advantage is true tho
[0:58:11] Bigace1116: I mean shadowlands had alittle bit
[0:58:12] Rusken_: M+ ruined the game
[0:58:17] Zarackaz: Legion with set bonuses
[0:58:18] yuhkz: yeahd 6p sets
[0:58:24] Scriix: 2p/4p
[0:58:24] MrDread: ye
[0:58:27] mavrikbtw: oh right
[0:58:28] Bigace1116: but Legion would be the best before M+
[0:58:29] MrDread: that was bis on a lot of people
[0:58:30] prestonrayne: yeah it was awful
[0:58:30] JackOfAllApocalypses: and some insane trinkets
[0:58:31] JanSladkovsky: legion was flawed with those fucking legendary pieces tho
[0:58:32] BipolarPongal: MM hunter needed
[0:58:33] ifuse: yee I remember doing that on my maeg
[0:58:38] Bollash: It also had titanforging so you could have high ilvl pieces
[0:58:38] Scriix: hunters rocked an old 2piece forr AWHILE
[0:58:39] HarmlessCurse: farming titan forges of old tier
[0:58:39] Line_0: I personally hate that you get everything from m+ so fast
[0:58:39] BenQtee: tomb to antorus
[0:58:39] mavrikbtw: yea. I totally forgot about that wow
[0:58:41] Artenuous: for certain classes, yeah, given the legendary pieces didn't block ur tier set
[0:58:44] SovexFFXIV: @Rusken_ might have ruined it for you my friend but I enjoy m+ grind
[0:58:50] BenQtee: wear 2 piece tomb and rest from antorus @Maximum
[0:58:54] adleydarling: i mean i did use the eggnog ring in aberrus
[0:58:56] chubbytheboi: I still remember MoP RWF where raiders went in with full BiS from previous tier and started smashing
[0:58:59] biglonelytv: yea that shits weird
[0:59:01] Elliham: lets be honest there fanboying over old content that they have rose colored glasses and dont want to change
[0:59:03] menzlo: M+ only gear
[0:59:05] Baglio: @kiriuped When he's played since the games inception, I would disagree. Again, certain aspects are exactly why he is not going hard in WoW anymore, and it clearly isn't just Asmon, since there is a giant post with a lot of support on the forums. It isn't a one-sided "ignorant react streamer" situation
[0:59:11] noirlol: @SovexFFXIV m+ is the most fun in this game bcs the gameplay is goated
[0:59:19] NotD4k: MM hunters are still using Nelth trinkets Pointless
[0:59:21] NotD4k: Sadge
[0:59:23] Scriix: after wrath? i think the ilvl jumps from tier to tier went WAY up
[0:59:25] fatbotmgrrl: Yes.  2 piece and 4 piece was very strong in WoD
[0:59:27] Basic_3: If you change this it fucks over returning players which is rough
[0:59:31] vmaster11: but in turn that would populate the old content
[0:59:32] fokare: it sucks and they’re making it worse making old mythic be LFR level in the new tier
[0:59:35] targus92dd: that is how seasons works tho.
[0:59:35] Line_0: Raid gear is invalidated instantly and it feels bad
[0:59:36] AGGRO___: GGG LOGIN
[0:59:38] Dyez: I don't know thats just a peace i cant upgrade
[0:59:38] boxytt: I mean that gear helps you farm higher dungeons earlier..not the end of the world
[0:59:38] megatin: On the other hand, it sucks starting a new season and NOT getting upgrades because last season is better
[0:59:38] zukohonor: generic tier sets for all specs
[0:59:44] Dicath: they could have tokens drop from new raid that lets you buy old raid stuff
[0:59:44] jace193: jace193 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[0:59:45] guynormally: none of these problems would exist if mythic raid didn't drop gear xdd
[0:59:48] valdekius: it works fine in games like eso, people just keep raiding the old raids and it's fun
[0:59:49] Elliham: he also doesnt remember how hard it was to get enough geared people to do raiding
[0:59:50] filos0phia: the thing is there'd always be people doing the content if the gear was relevantt
[0:59:51] Destrolisher: Destrolisher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! why is the normal raider talking about mythic AINTNOWAY
[0:59:51] GreenSectorA: in theory if you needed to grind it other people would too
[0:59:51] BipolarPongal: LetHimJoel
[0:59:55] spivet: oh we are COOKING
[0:59:55] fokare: cringeeeeee
[0:59:56] Sulm: Honestly, end of dungeon loot from M+ probably shouldn't be as good compared to the equivalent raid difficulty
[0:59:56] wademoney3590: i agree that rEvoker is very good as well, but as the healing officer for 10 years of cutting edge (which isn’t world first i understand) the healing profile -> rsham is the best healer on this fight and disagreeing is fundamentally the wrong opinion. if they do or don’t bring rsham it moreso has to do with their comp and DPS slots, less to do with healers. please understand my take before you address me again. 󠀀
[0:59:56] chaosreaper0: shocker
[0:59:57] dullermanjaro: u had to do azhara raid for trinket in bfa
[0:59:57] CloudyHS: trash take wtf
[0:59:58] GreenSectorA: now if thats fun idk
[0:59:59] PurpleKami: no catchup gear sure is an asmon take
[0:59:59] SovexFFXIV: I like the way it is now ngl... gear should be a means to an end, not a reward.
[0:59:59] Blut103: what a take
[1:00:02] Sothis_best_girl: trash take is trash
[1:00:03] thegrt13: nerfing m+ item level and making keys harder/giving gear for later keys
[1:00:03] BigTrout3: HOLY
[1:00:03] Thdlock: baseg
[1:00:04] Boreall: That's so fucking cringe
[1:00:05] PPowzer74: ew wtf
[1:00:06] tow996: easy, make mythic gear from previous patch as strong as heroic gear of current patch @Maximum
[1:00:06] talkley: HUH
[1:00:07] Jorityxd: fuck no
[1:00:08] moxterity: LMAO
[1:00:09] ThisIsAsabel: lmao
[1:00:09] Zaisx: no
[1:00:09] rpgonlyforme: gear lockouts to m+ was my reaction to that point.  for the first month
[1:00:09] Spartany25: what if the last 2 bosses didnt drop gear and only dropped raid vantus that stacked for the rest of the tier??
[1:00:10] CloudyHS: FUCK NO
[1:00:10] Cakerinotv: catchup gear?
[1:00:10] Wikedlyrics: WhoLetHimJoel
[1:00:11] KaisenSiru: No
[1:00:11] cassd32: hard disagree
[1:00:12] ShowDUH: FUCK NO
[1:00:12] Gabber__: absolute trash take
[1:00:12] GandelionWhite: LMAO
[1:00:13] Zunima: he is classic wow brained
[1:00:13] spivet: the kitchen is burning down guys
[1:00:13] reggiepowa: NOPERS
[1:00:13] Floydhawk_: nope
[1:00:14] uncred95: meds
[1:00:14] Robohobbo: That;s not a bad take
[1:00:14] HeiroGaming: ooooooooooooooof
[1:00:14] prestonrayne: god no
[1:00:14] mezmerized09: huh?????
[1:00:15] Boreall: This is such a Classic take and I'm a Classic player
[1:00:15] TheBoosch: god he’s so wrong
[1:00:16] mekks_: fuuuuck no
[1:00:16] comFox: god no
[1:00:17] atamdev: absolutely not
[1:00:17] vannerosenpai: nah thanks
[1:00:18] yeyanow: really bad take
[1:00:18] Boreall: This is so gross
[1:00:18] Nickystr1x: lets just go ahead and put that take into the trash lmao
[1:00:19] mezmerized09: L take
[1:00:20] YayFiber: you know it's fucked if THD agrees
[1:00:20] KaisenSiru: Very classic take
[1:00:21] MrDread: good luck getting a mythic group for the first raid of dragonflight KEKW
[1:00:21] NotNullifer: yikes
[1:00:21] Robohobbo: That's literally Fated
[1:00:21] Reiven_____: FUCK NO
[1:00:21] ThisIsAsabel: nobody is doing the earlier raid to let you catch up gear
[1:00:23] CloudyHS: L TAKE
[1:00:23] Robohobbo: guys
[1:00:23] Zunima: Classic wow take yep
[1:00:23] PPowzer74: no thanks LUL
[1:00:23] talkley: bro is cooking frozen fish
[1:00:23] Altairian8: this man loves onslaught girdle so much
[1:00:24] Basic_3: People want to play with their friends, not farm 40 hours of old raids.
[1:00:24] Robohobbo: chill
[1:00:25] targus92dd: lol, he said alt catchup was bad before.
[1:00:25] forshard: LMAO Karazgan was catch-up gear. People hated that right? Dumb
[1:00:25] BipolarPongal: xddShrug
[1:00:25] Rafix1301: ????
[1:00:26] Docaan: if there is no catch up gear i would never sub play mid-expansion
[1:00:26] garynrex2: classic asmongold take
[1:00:27] mekks_: makes alts suuuuck
[1:00:29] nathom2008: every raid being relevant has literally never been the case - even in classic.
[1:00:29] Robohobbo: its literally fated
[1:00:31] swo12: BASED
[1:00:31] moxterity: WE LOVE 20 WEEKS OF HARD FARM
[1:00:32] Baglio: 50/50 take
[1:00:33] Starcillo: trash takke
[1:00:33] atamdev: you let him overcook. shit is burned
[1:00:34] freehawk1: Idk why he wants to talk for new players he is an OG
[1:00:34] Line_0: Yeah no LUL
[1:00:34] Bollash: With who?
[1:00:36] Cronuoss: terrible take.
[1:00:36] Robohobbo: jesus the bias is unreal
[1:00:36] chaosreaper0: that only works if you are a streamer or have guilds to carry you
[1:00:37] TheGame402: raider take
[1:00:37] wademoney3590: What the heck did you just say about the Evolution of Combat, you little rookie? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Gielinor's most prestigious guilds, and I've been involved in numerous covert operations in the Wilderness, and I have over 300 confirmed PKs.
[1:00:38] Wikedlyrics: L take
[1:00:38] penfold01: haha this opinion sucks
[1:00:38] layoutes: not wrong
[1:00:39] ShowDUH: bruh nobody wanna go into vault and aberrus right now
[1:00:39] azoozi_ttv: attunement YEP
[1:00:40] CloudyHS: WhoLetHimJoel
[1:00:42] Zunima: I don't want to play WoW 24/7
[1:00:42] Robohobbo: He's literally talking about fated
[1:00:43] spivet: this man wants to take your alts out back and shoot them
[1:00:43] Therealbrokensword: the only person who thinks that is someone who has 50k potential carries watching him him daily
[1:00:44] stonedmonkey: If you had the playbase..... sure.....
[1:00:44] kniftty: Can the average player do old raids in Final Fantasy, or is that a streamer benefit to get groups
[1:00:44] StarShopping95: ???
[1:00:44] arzibi: going through the raids with who, exactly? Who will be doing this?
[1:00:44] Lidorissa: ???
[1:00:45] Madcatmk02: ain't NOBODY got time for that
[1:00:45] minglium: the thing is no one is playing
[1:00:45] vmaster11: TRUE
[1:00:45] nathom2008: Literally wasn't even like that in classic lol
[1:00:45] Robohobbo: this is fated
[1:00:47] Ensanee: didnt cook
[1:00:47] vannerosenpai: you should go through all the expansions
[1:00:48] Jujokka: hes right
[1:00:48] ysilentswordy: wut
[1:00:48] kiriuped: @Baglio Sure, but you cant take the games inception (which he didnt play btw it was late into vanilla), but in any case you cant compare that to the current state of the game because they arent even relatively the same, I understand that someone that has played the game a lot in the past is a valid voice but this xpac alone he hasnt hardly touched the game, and through SL and DF alone theres been major changes
[1:00:49] Boreall: This guy doesn't like MMOs LOL
[1:00:49] Camelbak21: he is right
[1:00:49] Kamehameshaw: I bet he wants attunements back too
[1:00:49] Greannan: It creates really bad guild issues
[1:00:49] Morayeden: Do not let him cook\
[1:00:50] supmeh: I mean I would _like_ to go through old raids, but I don't want to spend a month finding other people to do it with me
[1:00:50] Jjmn12: there's something there
[1:00:50] JanSladkovsky: ALSO Agree,
[1:00:50] looya: he wants it like classic
[1:00:51] Spartany25: no one is doing old content
[1:00:52] LuciFeariUm: yo wheres that guy in chat that said asmon is allowed to have an opinion
[1:00:53] Acario22: he is right what are you talking about
[1:00:54] TheBoosch: finding a group for that “new content” every week would be a nightmare
[1:00:55] SandStorm273: not everyone raids though. catch up gear helps the casuals keep up somewhat.
[1:00:55] ectocantaim: bro hasnt played a game in years and just yapping ICANT
[1:00:55] talkley: his chat loves it KEKW
[1:00:57] ThisIsAsabel: Asmo can just invite 400 smonglers to get raid carried anywhere
[1:00:58] lastericalive: he’s a little bit right
[1:00:58] antipheonixna: if people hate farm isnt the issue people are farming too long a patch or getting to a wall too fast?
[1:00:58] siremoualbou: he's right tbf
[1:00:58] KamkazeV2: Good like finding people to get farm old content
[1:00:59] Gabber__: hellllnoooo, this doesnt even work in classc , you could gear ppl in TG gear and take them to BWL where they got upgrades
[1:00:59] Boreall: Dude just said the way you get gear in MMOs is bad KEKW
[1:01:00] pabu_xd: This is coming from the guy that just gets carried and given shit
[1:01:01] CloudyHS: Acario22 hes spinning on it
[1:01:03] LuciFeariUm: this is why asmon isnt allowed to have an opinion
[1:01:03] willpow2: I agree with this take
[1:01:04] ThisIzD: no, thats one of the major issues with Lost Ark. Having to prog all the old raids before you can make it to end game. its fucking terrible.
[1:01:04] Starcillo: So if you want to come back late in the expansion you need to do all other seasons, that is trash
[1:01:04] Arcth_: he think everyone in the world dont have jobs?
[1:01:05] Osterberg501: "welfare epics" argument, gotta him em with the 15 year old talking point.
[1:01:07] Wikedlyrics: imagine having to drag your alts all the way through every tier to catch them up
[1:01:09] willpow2: More content = Good
[1:01:10] herbishkehd1: item levels are just too fucked theres no way to do it
[1:01:10] Blut103: algethar puzzlebox BASED
[1:01:10] Rafix1301: If they removed catch up gear still nobody would do old raids
[1:01:11] texazbandit: I don’t think it’s extreme tbh
[1:01:12] EppatTV: I mean, people would still sell boost and skip all the gearing lol
[1:01:12] dubbyatt: guzzler Kreygasm
[1:01:13] vannerosenpai: people would just pay more carries for the last raid LUL
[1:01:14] vmaster11: no vaults
[1:01:15] whitexscale: Convergance of Fates from Nighthold
[1:01:16] JayBlaaaze: that would make pugging horrible, spreading the pug players over more content
[1:01:17] layoutes: raids should be relevant at least in same expansion
[1:01:17] tumbro: bloodkeeper diurna ring Aware
[1:01:17] jin_spear: leggos should be bis for expansion tho
[1:01:19] mezmerized09: exactly LUL
[1:01:19] Cakerinotv: spiteful storm DH's KEKW
[1:01:19] grimdark_dork: it's been his complaint since TBC, that all raids reset and you have no reason to go back to the old raids
[1:01:20] mavrikbtw: vault ring was good during Abberus
[1:01:20] Thoreya: chat acting like they dont agree with asmon with every single thing he says lol
[1:01:20] darkgorgon: @LuciFeariUm isnt allowed ... sure karen
[1:01:21] slugg_tk: I think it's true in some situations IF you can consistently find groups for old content
[1:01:21] rzocys0: imagine coming back to the game and being told you have to do a raid that isyears old for a bis piece @Maximum
[1:01:21] 404Moose: Wait, what would you do with dungeons then? Do all the old raids first THEN do the current dungeons?
[1:01:21] Camelbak21: @Boreall That's not what he said lol
[1:01:21] Robohobbo: I agree with his take
[1:01:21] codydoubleu: its too hard to incentivize enough players of every role to have all raids relevant and easy to pug. not to mention having to do 3 raids a week potentially
[1:01:22] vmaster11: get rid of vaults
[1:01:23] misran: sorry but everyone who played in TBC will absolutely disagree with that.  it was fucking miserable when you picked up a new recruit that wasn't caught up
[1:01:23] Cronuoss: he said, its good for new players. but imagine how bad it would feel to go thru multiple raids just get to the last raid after you spent so long leveling your character.
[1:01:24] Robohobbo: its literally fated
[1:01:25] TheCJrose1234: fated is awesome
[1:01:25] Klutch81: Does M+ not gear anyone then?  lol
[1:01:25] Elliham: no hes not
[1:01:27] SlowboLaggins: i wouldnt wanna do every raid each week tbh if everything is relevant
[1:01:27] q_u_v_p: how does his take work with m+?
[1:01:27] Pyrrha_GG: no one going back to play old raid, so new players just stuck in queue for 100 years trying to get up to speed, also alts exist?
[1:01:28] Dyez: I think he is saying you need to farm ilvl in raids
[1:01:28] daskautzman: Blizz could do all of this and then he'd just complain about something new
[1:01:29] fokare: I don’t think so lol
[1:01:29] CloudyHS: he hates fated
[1:01:32] whitexscale: Remember the fire dmg ring from vaults? People got tired of it
[1:01:32] wowtrucker: See azshara trinket @maximum
[1:01:33] valdekius: he's not saying that you don't replace the items, he's saying that the step up is less I think, so that the old gear is still relevant and provides a ladder
[1:01:33] iloveuminkey: asmon liked bfa
[1:01:33] rottisxd: he is fan saying wow is bad
[1:01:34] daskautzman: there is no pleasing these people
[1:01:34] racks22: why someone that doesnt play the game is complaining ?
[1:01:34] Sothis_best_girl: he hates it
[1:01:36] Swayvuh: they should really try shaking up stats
[1:01:37] Kebabit0: we had that, it was called Heart of Azeroth and everyones hated it KEKW
[1:01:38] TheBoosch: get to max level and then just never get to play with your friends what a brilliant take lololol
[1:01:38] chubbytheboi: fated is laaaaaaaazy
[1:01:43] rzocys0: he dislikes fated as well, he dislikes anything retail @Maximum
[1:01:43] Dicath: he basically wants more classic stuff back in retail
[1:01:43] TheSabin: even if you are casual you cant even experience previous raid tiers in LFR from the same xpac, nobody queues for them
[1:01:43] Thdlock: HONING baseg
[1:01:44] Khorvan: I came back to the game in the latest patch and if I had to do all the old content before I could play with my friends I would have just quit again
[1:01:45] gzok__: bold of you to assume he's a fan of anything currently in the game
[1:01:45] HarmlessCurse: imagine trying to recruit players at the end of the tier and having to farm them through ALL of the tiers just to raid the current tier
[1:01:45] TheSHAYdynasty: @q_u_v_p +100 keys
[1:01:46] flow_mein: artifacts Sadge
[1:01:46] Thdlock: baseg
[1:01:46] Elliham: hes a fan of old expacs thats it
[1:01:47] Boreall: @Camelbak21 Yes it is, the ENTIRE point of an MMO RPG is to gain gear, have new content come out and to get new gear again
[1:01:48] iloveuminkey: fated ayaya
[1:01:50] wasGsuz: this doesn't work because of m+
[1:01:51] iciunoy: Do you think it would be a good or a bad thing to have raids from older patches scale up with new seasons?
[1:01:51] Line_0: Hmm yeah maybe like a forge thing that upgrades gear
[1:01:52] M0nkeys: if you would give him anything he's asking for he would still hate WoW, he's just done with the game
[1:01:52] Sulm: Not keep gear, but use it as a stepping stone to the next tier
[1:01:53] ThisIzD: @Thdlock Aware
[1:01:57] Chrisd1991: vanilla
[1:01:59] l1n0x_: the only way that works is with titanforging
[1:01:59] torchedwood: his idea is just no m+ gear, you need old raid gear to prog the new one, he just wants the bc model back
[1:01:59] theweirdsquiggly: this might have worked in classic with a more spread out player base, but not now
[1:02:01] ItzStrictlyFaded: faded?
[1:02:01] bubblebazook: full clearing razageth just to be told you need to do it again next tier would make me want to angel form
[1:02:02] huntermaster_95: More like how WotLK used to be, do each raid for gear before next, no insane catch up mechanics like now with m+ farming
[1:02:02] Tanonn: @Thdlock LMAO
[1:02:02] kniftty: @Cronuoss Yea, have fun farming the 2 old raids before you can do amir'drassil right?
[1:02:04] Boreall: Imagine being forced to farm Vault, Aberrus and Amirdrussy every single week. It's as awful as it sounds
[1:02:05] path19101: It creates a dead zone in between waiting for raids. Like okay you've got the gear, now what? Raid log?
[1:02:05] Gabber__: @racks22 he has to find something to say to get views and make cash. its content. whether its right or not
[1:02:06] Piki9: I think he is saying that gear from the first raid should be worse than the next, but that's how you do gear progression (I.e. no catch up gear) @maximum
[1:02:06] wowtrucker: Azshara trinket
[1:02:08] zukohonor: we too indoctrinated with mediocre gameplay content
[1:02:10] talkley: chat stop saying fated sucks its better than the old style of letting us play the last raid for 9+ months
[1:02:11] willpow2: What if you gated the new raids with ilvl requirements?
[1:02:11] Camelbak21: but moom, if everthing was relevant to a new player fated would be less value Sadge
[1:02:12] surpriseparty20: It's a shame blizzard makes cool raids that become irrelevant after a few months . When I played Shadowlands I didn't do nathria till fated and I missed prob the best raid of the expansion
[1:02:12] targus92dd: they had to tune 1000 trinkets all the time
[1:02:12] xpungax: old raid gear should be relevant somehow. Even if it's to help you getting into the current raid/tear
[1:02:13] HeiroGaming: @Thdlock whats good THD
[1:02:13] chubbytheboi: fated is giga lazy cus they can't progress their story enough and create content for a 3rd major patch
[1:02:14] leubinator: @Maximum he wants it to be like tbc where u had to start with kara to get into t5 into t6 raids
[1:02:15] bigoldmeatpie: that only works for people that have thousands of viewers to carry them through each raid
[1:02:16] CloudyHS: @Maximum people hated the eranog ring
[1:02:16] Ritashi2: It works in single player or small coop/MonHun style games
[1:02:18] dopamine360: old raid meet new ilvl mythic after new raid is cleared on mythic?
[1:02:19] antipheonixna: its not the game anymore, and thats not the solution to farming isn't fun
[1:02:21] Slapsstick: bfa fire mage trinket
[1:02:24] PPowzer74: @Maximum I'm already loggin off alt as soon as I see crests and flightstones again, tell me to raid 1 to 3 again? not happening
[1:02:25] ThisIsAsabel: Item would need to change for that : stats way closer in stats from tier to tier, with effects attached, that would still be relevant and BiS for certain classes
[1:02:27] herbishkehd1: fated than a hoe
[1:02:29] codydoubleu: imagine trying to pug for a beacon or grieftorch right now lmao
[1:02:30] spinnie: I think he references how it was in vanilla and tbc, having to kill ony for your cloak, mc for your tier2 piece, etc when you start
[1:02:31] Kamehameshaw: There was catch up gear in wrath though. The justice token gear bypassed ulduar didnt it so you could do ToGC and ICC faster?
[1:02:33] vmaster11: he doesn't necessarily argue to keep all the gear. But the progression through raids rather than catch up gear is the important point
[1:02:40] wademoney3590: everyone was bad dude lol
[1:02:41] Cronuoss: @kniftty how about, get the gear you want from the latest raid then going back to have fun in the old raids.
[1:02:41] tow996: @Maximum what if we removed ilvls, introduced bunch of stats like in arpgs, and made gear stats like in arpgs Hmm
[1:02:42] Bigace1116: Thats the thing with all MMO right now tho like clear content and then move on to the next
[1:02:43] el_vegee: yes very true
[1:02:44] wademoney3590: now we arent
[1:02:47] jin_spear: aint nobody got time for that + cost of opportunity
[1:02:47] ICitizenErasedI: i think forcing people to go through the entire expansion content is a "noble" thought but as others have said new players will have no shot at getting together enough people to go through these old raids
[1:02:48] penfold01: he means like classic where some of the items are itemized crazy and you’re wearing a purple shirt from 3 raids ago because some dev went nuts with the sliders
[1:02:49] hotmanpop: singleplayer games support your time LUL
[1:02:50] ItsYent: asmon's idea game is classic raiding where you have nothing to do except raid and raids are turbo easy and you get all the loot
[1:02:50] vannerosenpai: in a system like that Asmon would skip all the raids and get boosted by his viewers
[1:02:51] Basic_3: Was anybody happy to wear the 3-stone ring for the rest of the expansion? No way.
[1:02:51] jjwallababy: dude just wants to be 17 again but doesnt know any other way to say it
[1:02:54] mezmerized09: That's very good
[1:03:00] Spartany25: also new raid lasts WAY longer than 3 months, he was hyberbolic on this one
[1:03:00] Line_0: I dont know the solution but it does feel bad to have all gear deleted every season start
[1:03:03] brainstormerinc: we were gaming at such a lower lvl as well as far as what a pc and internet was back then too
[1:03:03] Boreall: There has been catch up gearin WoW Since TBC, literally. Zul'Aman was a catch up raid
[1:03:04] huntermaster_95: Issue is just Blizz creating a game for the ones who stayed
[1:03:05] surpriseparty20: Only Vanilla and BC do that thing tbh . Even in wrath u do TOC prob and then jump into ICC . Old raids really don't matter
[1:03:06] Arm1nn__: sounds like he wants it like classic when you had to go to MC to BWL/AQ then Naxx
[1:03:06] darkgorgon: @kniftty ye thats the thing cause wow is not an mmo anymore. New times = new kind of wow
[1:03:07] MorningTori: seasonal game models are everywhere
[1:03:10] kingcamps_alot: they adapted to the current flow of games imo
[1:03:10] kniftty: @Cronuoss I was agreeing with you
[1:03:11] Konsu3: @Maximum wrath started with catch up gear. i just geared alts with the 3 icc dungeons and some badge gear, then right into icc
[1:03:12] Baglio: @kiriuped Yeah for sure, I'll halfway agree with that. He did play SL though so it isn't as if he's TOTALLY out of touch. When it comes to DF, 100% you're correct. And I'd say a lot of issues he has spoken on prior (like in SL) have been fixed with the way DF plays. It's the best xpac we've had in years. But, I would definitely like to see more variance in our seasons/raids/etc. and be able to use older gear in current content. But, like Max basically said - that is a double-edged sword
[1:03:14] uncred95: ewww ap
[1:03:15] nathom2008: raids have literally NEVER been relevant for an entire expac lol
[1:03:15] EppatTV: he hated AP KEKW
[1:03:16] JakeParkbench: Why grind mobs in classic when you could be shooting bugs in Helldivers
[1:03:17] itsClubby: Chatting
[1:03:18] trevor_sub: bring back AP
[1:03:18] Thdlock: baseg
[1:03:18] ChilledPenguinn: Chatting holy
[1:03:22] biglonelytv: that shit was ass lol
[1:03:23] Wikedlyrics: it was for THD
[1:03:25] zukohonor: your confusing HW, with fun content to do
[1:03:26] malavander: there are games I know I'd love that I'll never have time to play
[1:03:26] iloveuminkey: ligion sux
[1:03:26] Syncronyze: he's not
[1:03:27] itzdelusion: hell no
[1:03:27] ampliDude7: yeah thats why it sucks for everybody else LUL
[1:03:29] OldFlorrysGhost: PepeLaugh
[1:03:29] CloudyHS: he hates AP
[1:03:29] Kamehameshaw: nope hated it
[1:03:29] antipheonixna: your also splitting your playerbase, imagine if m+ season 3 you were on key level 100
[1:03:30] Baahumbug: maximumThd1 maximumThd2
[1:03:32] Zarroe: WideTHD
[1:03:32] Luckycharms45: I think the issue main issue stems from accessibility - Mythic quality gear from past tiers is super inaccessible.
[1:03:33] BipolarPongal: WideTHD The prophet WideTHD
[1:03:34] sTumPy222: With M+ ingame it's irrelavant. Even if you are new and want to play with your friends they just boost you through some keys and then you get gear higher then the previous raids.
[1:03:34] CloudyHS: he literally just hates everything
[1:03:37] PurpleKami: world of chorecraft woo
[1:03:39] looya: @ICitizenErasedI he means that bis should still exist from vault during season 3 for example :)
[1:03:40] Elliham: lets be honest you sat around Ironforge with your raid gear for people to inspect you in vanilla wow
[1:03:40] theweirdsquiggly: if the raids were stupid easy sure then I’ll do multiple raids a patch but with this complexity I couldn’t be assed to do that much raiding
[1:03:42] Konsu3: he just hates retail, doesnt matter what they would do
[1:03:44] apoctheking: nah he hated it KEKW
[1:03:44] Cronuoss: @kniftty the way you worded it was weird lol
[1:03:45] lingling102: the issue described is basically m+ being repeatable with a reward that is a power gain and competetive to hc/early mythic gear from raid
[1:03:45] garynrex2: he did enjoy ap
[1:03:46] Syncronyze: WideTHD thd is right
[1:03:47] Destrolisher: @Baglio he got walled by normal raid in SL ICANT
[1:03:48] Boreall: He says this is for new players but he doesn't care that this would dramatically raise the barrier of entry to new players
[1:03:49] HarmlessCurse: who didn't love Island Expeditions and grinding for AP
[1:03:50] vannerosenpai: Raids are also a niche activity
[1:03:52] Thdlock: cap M+ for 6 months baseg make it give nothing
[1:03:52] Konsu3: he wants piss easy raid and easy gear
[1:03:57] Piki9: He is saying questing gear to world quest gear to vault to aberrus etc @maximum
[1:03:58] Morayeden: 0% chance i am going back to old content
[1:03:59] Slapsstick: If you could finish every raid in an hour itd be doable
[1:03:59] codydoubleu: there are no practical ways, these things wouldnt make him play the game
[1:04:00] jin_spear: very rares items are a opportunity for that
[1:04:04] rzocys0: how boring would it be if grieftorch was just bis for my DH all expansion though @Maximum ?
[1:04:06] iloveuminkey: raz
[1:04:07] vmaster11: yep
[1:04:07] spivet: what if there's an insane trinket in season 1 M+ that stays relevant and you literally can not acquire it in later seasons with the rotating pool?
[1:04:10] Cyony: razzy on HC was fucking sick
[1:04:11] ChilledPenguinn: YEP p2 raz
[1:04:14] nellfin: fated kinda is that tho?
[1:04:14] Rafix1301: remove ilvl
[1:04:15] HarmlessCurse: In Legion the Artifact appearance drops and Balance of Power quest chain kept people going through the raids
[1:04:17] texazbandit: I used to be that 24/7 player now wow is mad boring
[1:04:20] CloudyHS: you guys hated that
[1:04:21] Hymmer: Delete very rares
[1:04:25] noirlol: keeping older raids relevant this way for good gear is sick but i dunno
[1:04:26] jin_spear: maybe get very rare and make new raids drop the catchup of ilvl of it
[1:04:27] Boreall: Can you imagine just how bad the barrier of entry into an Xpac would be?
[1:04:27] gwenmh: these guys hate m+, they are little thds
[1:04:28] Zarroe: people still kinda farm the mounts/bow/lego
[1:04:30] Spartany25: wwhat about the clock questline from MOP, it made u do the old content without needing to farm loot @Maximum
[1:04:31] Camelbak21: they changed very rare to be a bonus now tho
[1:04:32] theweirdsquiggly: making raids relevant the entire expansion requires raids to be piss easy, not a fan
[1:04:33] cobaltheal: I just can't imagine going back to Sactum
[1:04:34] OldFlorrysGhost: very rare upgradable next season
[1:04:35] dejackarse: I cant wait for Fated Raz, it was hard but fun
[1:04:37] iciunoy: What about a difficulty that scales with raid ilvl?
[1:04:40] arzibi: nymue staff Aware
[1:04:41] Pyrrha_GG: blizz has just outright said they dont want people to have play old raids to play new content
[1:04:42] Sulm: The concept is you'd be undergeared doing amirdrassil, so you need gear from aberrus, and gear from vault to do aberrus, etc.
[1:04:43] brainrot_behavior: asking my guild to know 3 raids at a time LUL
[1:04:44] Baglio: @Destrolisher I mean thats just irrelevant to the core content he's speaking about...when it comes to mythic raiding itself, sure. Ofc the takes are gonna be out-of-touch with the current raiding situation.
[1:04:45] ectocantaim: like always ICANT
[1:04:45] path19101: But then you run into trying to find groups that aren't just carries/gdkp
[1:04:47] aFlyingGuru: @Maximum not sure if you care but worlds first finallly happened on the gw2 boss YEP
[1:04:48] nathom2008: ARE YOU TELLING ME people complain then offer no solution? lol
[1:04:49] Altairian8: i've never understood why dungeon/M+ gear goes up in ilvl every patch out of the gate, why doesn't M+1 have the same ilvl all expansion and every patch you just go higher in M+ levels with a higher ilvl cap?
[1:04:51] CloudyHS: complain with no solutions ICANT
[1:04:54] rzocys0: it would be boring if you had the same piece of gear for the whole expansion @Maximum
[1:05:02] Syncronyze: @iciunoy that's boring too imo. feeling like you're getting stronger is really fun
[1:05:02] Zaisx: KEKW
[1:05:02] Gizmo_Johnston: make mythic difficulty scale peoples gear so you can do the old stuff later and its not a joke
[1:05:02] Faraday5001: xdd
[1:05:03] penfold01: there’s no way I could convince anyone in my guild to rerun aberrus because my third alt needs a ring or whatever
[1:05:03] CloudyHS: OMEGALUL
[1:05:03] reggiepowa: oof
[1:05:04] EppatTV: here we go KEKW
[1:05:04] BipolarPongal: Professional CAUGHT
[1:05:05] CloudyHS: xdd
[1:05:05] BicardiTV: what if they make a currency system that gives ilvl relevant items purchased that drop from older roads?
[1:05:06] willpow2: OMEGALUL
[1:05:06] Helios_a: Bad take
[1:05:07] Starcillo: KEKW
[1:05:08] garynrex2: xdd here we go
[1:05:09] nationas: calebG
[1:05:10] Protoman_702: i would think it has to be something like good pieces or pieces added to the old raid later or ability to upgrade + token system to buy them too from all raids
[1:05:11] jjwallababy: xdd
[1:05:13] Rafix1301: kekw
[1:05:15] CloudyHS: CAUGHT PROFESSIONAL WOW GAMER LIQUID MAXIMUM
[1:05:19] Tanonn: Professional EZ
[1:05:23] ectocantaim: hes just yapping idk how someone can watch this guy ICANT
[1:05:23] Manashi_Mg: He doesn't want you to go back to previous raid for current tier. He wants you to progress throughout the full process instead of jumpstarting directly to the last tier
[1:05:24] hotmanpop: true tho
[1:05:25] Camelbak21: I meeeaaan
[1:05:26] Boreall: @Thdlock do you eat pringles with a spoon
[1:05:27] spivet: if I like this system can I call myself a pro gamer now?
[1:05:28] Attorneyatlawl: it’s true though, professional wow is a joke
[1:05:28] lolwhateverdog: i will say throwing away legendaries u just spent 100K gold on and only get to use during farm feels BAD
[1:05:28] Syghtless: i guess im proffessional, with curve and nothing higher
[1:05:29] Niroggo: liquid players RageyBoom
[1:05:29] yuhkz: oh just wait brother
[1:05:30] biglonelytv: I meeeeeeaaann....

[1:05:34] Wikedlyrics: Madge your fault
[1:05:34] Robohobbo: MAX HOW COULD YOU
[1:05:34] Hymmer: Why did you do this to Asman Max Stare
[1:05:34] Slapsstick: I feel like hes just backwards, the professional players are the only ones with enough time to clear all the raids every week KEKW
[1:05:34] Chrisd1991: @Maximum You could have every raid in the expansion drop 1-3 END GAME Item level which will incentivise going back
[1:05:35] itzdelusion: at the end of the day you don't design the game, blizzard does
[1:05:35] Piki9: He gave the lost ark example, of doing valtan @maximum
[1:05:36] Robohobbo: STOP WINNING
[1:05:38] chubbytheboi: Professional players are at fault NOTED
[1:05:40] Thdlock: @Boreall i eat it with a bowl

[1:05:46] Emerphish: we're on track for a 9 hour stream at this pace xdd
[1:05:47] Mordento: nobody forces blizz to be game as it is now
[1:05:49] Camelbak21: Top guilds kinda hold blizz by the balls feels like ngl
[1:05:49] CloudyHS: @ectocantaim bitter ex wow players who need to justify the fact they quit
[1:05:50] texazbandit: it’s a big portion of it though
[1:05:50] Line_0: Yeah it's not your fault if anything did happen
[1:05:50] NotD4k: ngl to u, RWF is the best thing from every season KEKW
[1:05:51] zeroni132: My main problem is that amazing fights people don't play + the fact that gear is immediately pointless after new patch
[1:05:52] mysduck: @Thdlock what kind of bowl
[1:05:52] Churchtrill: He goes into that, basically blames RWF for ruining the progression for everyone else
[1:05:52] headninja1ncharge: BIG WORD
[1:05:53] Oracle_WoW: if it wasnt you it would have been someone else
[1:05:53] bigoldmeatpie: having to go back 2 tiers to farm a single item is absolutely dogshit
[1:05:54] Attorneyatlawl: you’re coping if you don’t think it has some truth
[1:05:55] motinhagmr: no max. the problem is people want the old WoW. The WoW where there wasnt information, guides,addons, parses. people are bitter cauz they suck more than world first raiders. The solution for that intire post is simple. Make a competitive server for WF, make the game for apes in another. All problem solved. people are envious of 2 guilds. its simple. @Maximum
[1:05:55] TL_izPanda: YEP
[1:05:56] ZeronimoPewPew: we all know its THDs fault

[1:06:14] 324bee21: it’s not your fault but you have to admit Blizz does let the RWF impact raids

[1:07:49] payloon: i want to reroll lock but i cant, the bis is a season 1 trinket
[1:07:50] fronkacean: also dont get it twisted asmon was a massive complainer of titanforging
[1:07:51] Faraday5001: TRUE
[1:07:55] rzocys0: this harms the casuals more KEKW the best players have all the gear anyway @Maximum
[1:07:55] ICitizenErasedI: "people that pay the game professionally" is the biggest strawman in wow discourse
[1:07:56] zenkodac: Yea cus removing power grind has historically worked really well for the game
[1:08:01] streatmagic_gaming: Weren't you all the ones that were farming Old Warrior's soul during the last raid of Shadowlands?
[1:08:04] kheim: When asmongold realizes he is by definition a professional, since he gets payed whilst playing the game
[1:08:05] sangvet: YEP
[1:08:05] misran: he's a millionaire from playing wow.  he's more of a "professional" than any WF raider xdd
[1:08:06] Taytor: pYe
[1:08:06] Crystallize007: +39 yea
[1:08:06] Line_0: Yeah it's too much atm
[1:08:07] Jjmn12: yeah
[1:08:10] sarrowzthewarlock: 51
[1:08:10] torchedwood: yeah
[1:08:12] Wikedlyrics: grifters like Asmon are a far bigger cancer for influence on the game than pro players if we're being honest
[1:08:13] cesartcab: yep and its feels good
[1:08:13] Destrolisher: yes and it was good
[1:08:14] matkassee: his whole chat is full of sheeps
[1:08:14] sarrowzthewarlock: yrros 51
[1:08:14] nathom2008: stat squish inc again
[1:08:15] Cjpriest: @fronkacean so were alot of other people too lowkey
[1:08:15] holmat: should be +10 ilvl
[1:08:16] Faraday5001: mythic abberus = normal amirdrassi.... it was FUCKING awful
[1:08:18] zerossussy: its not too much now
[1:08:18] Morayeden: Delete Gear
[1:08:19] kaydenqt: I mean, do you really want to hear the opinion of a 3X yo old man who lives in trash and isn't capable of taking care of himself
[1:08:20] Piki9: Casuals complained more about old trinkets than any @maximum
[1:08:20] flow_mein: get rid of LFR gear
[1:08:21] FuraiEU: @maximum can you move your chat a little higher so we can see asmons pepega chat? Plz
[1:08:23] Rafix1301: ye they're doubling down on seasonal gameplay
[1:08:23] sarrowzthewarlock: 15 sorry
[1:08:25] zerossussy: its good very great now
[1:08:29] fronkacean: @Cjpriest yeah ik, im not saying its wrong just funny to see the full 180
[1:08:30] willpow2: Yeah just crank the ilvls to keep people grinding more and play the game more
[1:08:36] darkgorgon: world first / elite / professional raiders would have any item that is required no problem :D
[1:08:36] grobb12: KEKW
[1:08:37] Konsu3: @misran only professional in reacting and leeching content
[1:08:39] Sir_Kalabad: hes about to swallow a roach
[1:08:42] fojda: fojda subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:08:43] BipolarPongal: LetHimJoel
[1:08:44] Thoreya: theres 4 difficulties of raid
[1:08:44] gwenmh: lock ilvl for mythic so you can’t do it with higher ilvl that the previous mythic tier
[1:08:47] Thoreya: thats impossible
[1:08:48] surpriseparty20: Power creep is gonna go insane halfway next expansion I swear
[1:08:48] Strike9172: ez fix, mythic should only upgrade to the next mythic tier, instead of mythic upgrading to normal of the next tier
[1:08:50] trevor_sub: @Maximum i feel like the professional wow players are the people under RTWF and higher than heroic gamers
[1:08:50] Cjpriest: @fronkacean i think hes realizing that systme slike that werent actually THAT bad
[1:08:52] logain_13: And it reduces the power of splits
[1:08:56] wademoney3590: Speak your Truth Brother
[1:08:56] Boreall: The jump this Xpac was due to changing the entire system of how you get gear
[1:08:58] zenkodac: By his standards it would still be too much
[1:09:00] ItchY_val: yeah slower ilvl creep would be nice
[1:09:00] vannerosenpai: feels boring
[1:09:00] ThisIsAsabel: Maybe a big item reset should happen every season, ARPG seasons like
[1:09:00] jandemain: no i want to progress my character
[1:09:01] syknus_tv: would also make there not be month long RFWF with smaller jumps
[1:09:01] huntermaster_95: Reduce difficulties to 2, normal and heroic
[1:09:01] torchedwood: yeah, but how do you want both, they ask for gear to nerf content but also for there be no Ilvl jump.
[1:09:01] Bryyo: @maximum what would be the problem with allowing you to upgrade old gear with like slightly more crests?
[1:09:04] Zarackaz: Make end tier bosses be equal to tier start bosses maybe
[1:09:05] Scriix: there was a chart awhile back that showed ilvl jumps tier to tier and start to end of expansion, and i think it was after wrath they started goin crazy
[1:09:06] CloudyHS: CAUGHT
[1:09:06] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[1:09:06] megatin: It feels bad to kill a new boss though and have it drop loot that's not better than what you already have
[1:09:07] SovexFFXIV: damn bro, you wow players hate Asmon more than us FF14 players do LUL
[1:09:08] lingling102: the larger ilvl gap is a solution to another problem tho
[1:09:09] Floydhawk_: lol
[1:09:11] JoaEUW: I mean it should still jump so much that HC couldnt be cleared week 1 with full mythic from prev season right?
[1:09:11] roronoariven: do you think that takes away fantasy elements of actually feeling genuinely stronger between patches
[1:09:12] dorki: TRUE
[1:09:13] CloudyHS: DIESOFCRINGE
[1:09:13] MrDread: @Konsu3 lets not attack other streamers, even if their chats can get toxic towards this one :)
[1:09:14] Camelbak21: People will MIN MAX 0.1% of dmg, you don't need every tier to be like 100% dmg increase dawg
[1:09:15] NYKO7_: KEKW
[1:09:17] bubblebazook: imagine still killing eronog every week still trying to get a ring a year and a half into the patch
[1:09:19] R0NGG: but it would be less fun imo.. i like feeling power gains
[1:09:21] Ritashi2: I think it would be fine if old mythic gear was equivalent to next tier heroic
[1:09:23] dullermanjaro: AINTNOWAY these profesionals
[1:09:23] hotmanpop: THE REACTER IS REACTING
[1:09:23] faythes68: to be honest this whole expantion was an experiment session, similar to SL, but this time ppl liked most of it
[1:09:24] thenateo2: to play the game?
[1:09:25] antipheonixna: but then people just complain that now they have to farm, this isnt getting to the issue of people hate farm
[1:09:26] Cakerinotv: the less you jump the more the ilvl of previous tier matters, which honestly is kinda cursed imo. I dont wanna have to do the old content to get my bis gear
[1:09:26] vannerosenpai: so true, dude has not played in 7 years LUL
[1:09:27] grobb12: he has a point here
[1:09:29] Tabun_Time: cuz it is a game
[1:09:30] Ignite_CLO: Bro his fake rage is so cringe.
[1:09:34] Floydhawk_: cos its bis? for 5 months? so do it?
[1:09:34] PuzzleMonkey: But isn't that all mmos?
[1:09:36] reggiepowa: that is fun though
[1:09:36] Elliham: cause its a game and you do it for fun
[1:09:37] iloveuminkey: hahaa
[1:09:37] Larshouma: Mad-imum
[1:09:38] reggiepowa: I like farming gear
[1:09:39] zenkodac: It isnt deleted you start way stronger by farming
[1:09:40] freehawk1: @SovexFFXIV nah they only hate him here in the casual community he is a hero
[1:09:42] chaosreaper0: I mean it's a game?
[1:09:43] Baskkov: @Maximum destiny 2 does it really well
[1:09:43] ampliDude7: was there ever a system asmon even liked?
[1:09:45] PuzzleMonkey: Like you get gear then you get the next gear
[1:09:46] luigikrosss: seeing a poe player say this...
[1:09:48] Thealzki: is he going to make a new point or is he just repeating the same shit as always LUL
[1:09:49] Jirofanboy: He says it like there is no one playing poe or diablo LUL
[1:09:49] jkJustice: i mean i like the gear chase, kinda why i'm playing a game like this
[1:09:50] goop: dorki getting distracted again can u ban him
[1:09:52] motinhagmr: The intire post on "raiding has to change" is just a cringe moment of a salty sucky boy. the game is linear fact. The old feeling when you see some1 with a very hard piece of gear gone? fact. BUT RAIDING IS SO GOOD! People are just envious from people who actually kill stuff. other than raiding wow sucks thanks
[1:09:52] DonDabon: its not only about item lvl, its also how blizard makes items now vs at the begging. before u would get higher lvl gear from end raids, but it has trash stats, so old itemis still better
[1:09:54] YayFiber: If you're thinking about returning to wow as a semi casual player it only makes sense to jump in as a season starts
[1:09:55] atamdev: i like farming gear to be more powerful for the current content
[1:09:56] Majinbrew: same reason you farm a new league in poe
[1:09:59] fleks27: amirdrassil lfr = sark mythic was hella cooked
[1:10:00] BipolarPongal: @dorki o7
[1:10:01] jjwallababy: Am I fucking stupid or isnt this how games work? you do the content, the new content comes out, then you do that content
[1:10:05] sarrowzthewarlock: i was a little salty that i had to delete class trinket for warlock after getting it 3 weeks from next patch we cleared aotc raid and everything lol
[1:10:05] 324bee21: I am going to double down, any problems are caused by Blizz not Echo or Liquid
[1:10:08] vannerosenpai: @freehawk1 the casual community doesnt care about mythic raiding LUL
[1:10:08] payloon: @dorki o7
[1:10:11] yeyanow: Why even play the game? Imagine playing a game where you farmed once 2 years ago
[1:10:15] lolwhateverdog: all things considers it frustrates me so much that the voice of WoW/MMOs is a guy who has a youtube video of him "reviewing" not showering for a month
[1:10:16] fronkacean: amen
[1:10:17] Line_0: That does kill some guilds
[1:10:21] Syncronyze: you can't "take a break" as a guild tbh
[1:10:21] bayazijr: I would hate to be wearing a trinket from old content. They had to nerf Puzzle Box at the end of Season 1 on Unholy DK specifically because they would have worn it for the entirety of season 2
[1:10:22] iloveuminkey: byebye
[1:10:22] moxterity: we have 9 trials rn because of this
[1:10:23] alvesol: yep
[1:10:23] darkgorgon: guild taking break = 50/50
[1:10:24] kniftty: Lot of breaks happening right now lol
[1:10:27] spivet: it is nice to have a couple months to go play persona or something instead
[1:10:27] Swyvle: taking breaks while also playing other games with your guildies is BiS
[1:10:28] ShowDUH: One of the problem is that we jumped double the amount of ilvl this tier, vs i think the normal 13 ilvl gap
[1:10:29] Pyrrha_GG: you losing 25% of the people min
[1:10:32] chaos_terrain: people realize they actually don't miss playing
[1:10:33] riddlerboy: guilds have to take breaks together and play different games together, but yea, half of guilds just die
[1:10:34] texazbandit: if I wanted to take a break I’d just cancel my subscription lol
[1:10:35] leubinator: @dorki i heard u guys have the brh SAUCE
[1:10:37] Baglio: yeah our guild does breaks and we lose a few every time usually...gets kinda hairy...then the comp suffers as well @Maximum
[1:10:37] malavander: seasonal/service games are hamster wheel skinner boxes, this is news?
[1:10:38] JayPain: wo
[1:10:38] MajorFrog225: not sure if asmon is blaming you specifically, but blaming blizzard for designing things around you.
[1:10:38] fokare: my classic guild died from a 1 week break over Christmas lol
[1:10:40] Bryyo: what about crafted items that allow you to boost ilvl of old gear?
[1:10:41] Sulm: Legion and BFA still had things like relics and azerite armor that was raid specific and gave you more of a reason to want to run them instead of gearing from M+
[1:10:41] Larshouma: RWF cost thousands of dollars, like any kind of player can do that lmao, stop being deluded
[1:10:42] faythes68: capitalism
[1:10:48] Kamehameshaw: guild took a break during sylvanas prog, we never raided again.
[1:10:52] uncred95: i don't want to take a break tho
[1:10:56] Altairian8: the amount of wrath classic guilds that died to sod when wrath was running out of content to play was staggering
[1:10:58] darkgorgon: 25 men cause u need subs :D
[1:10:59] antipheonixna: you need a smoother content experience for raiders or more supplementary content
[1:10:59] dobi_gg: i agree!
[1:11:09] JayPain: would a lower ilvl inc inbetween tiers not make it so u take a longer break?
[1:11:13] Therealbrokensword: Wouldnt having gear for the next tier increase the dead time between and not decrease it?
[1:11:13] 324bee21: look at even you, taking a short break for Balatro an entirely different genre
[1:11:18] ampliDude7: they cant possibly create content as fast as people clear it. breaks are healthy imo
[1:11:19] tow996: just overhaul raid buffs/debuffs and make raids 10 man :)
[1:11:21] zeroni132: @Maximum the thing is you can see Thunderfury Blessed blade of the windseeker on Illidan kills in TBC, how do we get that back?
[1:11:22] offcuts: why cant there just be perma fated raids like SWTOR
[1:11:23] Ignite_CLO: Here comes the hottest take PepeLaugh
[1:11:27] SovexFFXIV: instead of waiting resources on  garbage like Season of Discovery or Cataclysm remaster they could just add an extra raid tier in between FeelsWeirdMan
[1:11:30] Latensify: Does this guy even play this game? lol
[1:11:33] Boreall: That entire paragraph reads like someone who wants to sound like they know what they're talking about
[1:11:38] CloudyHS: Latensify literally no'
[1:11:40] thenateo2: its like 99% for most people
[1:11:41] ExoGinos: ad
[1:11:42] Taytor: We went into Fyrakk last month at 100% power.
[1:11:45] Line_0: I think for most others it's pretty true
[1:11:46] dullermanjaro: Adge
[1:11:48] hyeheal: ad
[1:11:48] Syncronyze: yep
[1:11:49] Jjmn12: the only thing you are missing is mythic versions of those 2 boss's items
[1:11:49] Gromasaurus: So then guilds need to have better relationships, they should be trying to have friendships with each member or something close to that. Than just being a bunch of smaller friendships or randoms
[1:11:49] aescend_: Despairge
[1:11:51] TattersAU: 487/488
[1:11:52] Zynneh: Adge
[1:11:52] huntermaster_95: There's no ICC buff to help worse guilds
[1:11:53] fokare: we were world 160 ish we were geared as fuck
[1:11:53] nerefwow: 99%
[1:11:54] Cakerinotv: yep
[1:11:59] relentless5150: Adge
[1:12:01] Madcatmk02: yeah it's impossible for our raid to get stronger and we're on Tswift
[1:12:01] theweirdsquiggly: 7ads woop
[1:12:03] deadie3D: its way above 95%
[1:12:03] eightySix: @altairian8 doesn’t help that the future was cata and a ton of classic players have no interest what so ever in playing cata
[1:12:04] soundzGOOD: Adge 6
[1:12:04] Latensify: @CloudyHS youtube content be so goofy LUL
[1:12:05] mutual: ads, some one gift sub please
[1:12:05] M0nkeys: 2 minutes of ads
[1:12:07] M0nkeys: wtf!?
[1:12:20] Emerphish: but even if players aren't getting stronger the boss will keep getting nerfed (that feels worse to kill after a nerf instead of getting stronger thru farm)
[1:12:22] 1_blase: wtf is this 4 mins of ads
[1:12:22] BipolarPongal: AINTNOWAY it's only 6 minutes in?

[1:12:43] ExCodix: @M0nkeys it's nice having turbo KEKW
[1:12:43] Hehyioss: KJ was insane
[1:12:48] Konsu3: my guild cleared nighthold mythic and we never pulled kJ mythic, 2 kills on avatar
[1:12:48] Kawatteruwow: Same thing with Nzoth isnt it?
[1:12:48] texazbandit: 7 ads sheeeesh
[1:12:50] rottisxd: broken shore patch gave fuck ton of power creep its not the same
[1:12:52] Larocca_88: Naowh?
[1:12:52] docdoge: But in tomb that was a lot of other factors than gear and player power no?
[1:12:54] Cakerinotv: personal mechanics being far more important, gamers getting better at the game etc. is a major thing since then
[1:12:58] Churchtrill: Churchtrill subscribed with Prime. 
[1:13:00] Diazanite: isnt kj one of the least killed end boss or am i Dentge
[1:13:02] JanSladkovsky: Max, what is f.e. doing your raid group at this point? are you running farms? is there any reason apart from remaining in form. Or also breaks for your raiders?
[1:13:03] nadesgg: wasnt fallen avatar unkillable first week/s?
[1:13:07] bubblebazook: thats over 7 years ago
[1:13:10] Halt57: streaming killed raiding?

[1:14:10] PurpleKami: If Liquid / Echo finished the rwf, you know Asmon and his base would be saying this shit's too easy
[1:14:10] Larshouma: 100% true, 0.000001% of people are doing mythic content first weeks, costing thousand of dollars, you deluded kids
[1:14:11] TattersAU: Raiding would be so much more scuffed if RWF didnt make 90% of weakauras
[1:14:12] deadie3D: it's actually true, first set of nerfs dont come until you guys down last boss, unless its actually giga op
[1:14:13] faythes68: imaging saying that volcoros was made taking the top 0.1% inmind
[1:14:14] chadderz7: Bro should just stick to hc xdd
[1:14:15] ampliDude7: cata maybe gave the blueprints
[1:14:16] looya: Legion
[1:14:17] Boreall: Compare the top 100 guilds to the top 1000 even, don't even count the best of the best and the difficulty gap is massive. This "Mythic is too hard" take just comes from people who feel like they deserve to be able to clear every difficulty. What they need to learn is how to be happy with Heroic
[1:14:21] SpaEngi: PepegaPhone Onyxia took 3 months back in the day
[1:14:21] grobb12: we also have way more advance tools like WA packs etc
[1:14:22] jesuslouise: Raid+ would cover everyone
[1:14:24] lordsellia: I mean look... 8/9m right now and the challenge is maintaining a static 20man to bang our heads on the walls
[1:14:24] 1_blase: mythic needs to be difficult, heroic is way to easy
[1:14:25] Starcillo: FLASHBANG
[1:14:25] Lazz5: not only the players, they probably also want to challenge the devs to make better bosses
[1:14:27] timmayb166: weak auras has a lot to do with it too not just you guys but he also gets into that lol
[1:14:28] traisc: i think the argument is that you and echo should not be included in that tuning... you guys are better, so even if the raids are easier, you will naturally still beat the rest of us at clearing it
[1:14:29] straifulove: i didn't get better in 6 years of playing Sadge
[1:14:31] Kamehameshaw: are we getting another butt drawing Pog
[1:14:31] iloveuminkey: paint time
[1:14:38] fleks27: this is a good one
[1:14:40] fleks27: Larshouma: 100% true, 0.000001% of people are doing mythic content first weeks, costing thousand of dollars, you deluded kids
[1:14:44] chadderz7: xdd
[1:14:46] Xarconos: thats me lol
[1:14:49] zerossussy: race to world last xdd
[1:14:50] Galarian_Hp: we started the patch with 448-450? u guys had like 480 in week 2 or not? seems to me that getting this amount of gear this quick leads to overtuned "end"bosses
[1:14:53] motinhagmr: race to world last made my day.
[1:14:53] Slapsstick: @fleks27 glad someone else caught that xdd
[1:14:54] maddi_: I've thought blizzard should keep the difficulty has they have in the first month but after that, implement greater nerfs to allow a much larger % of the playerbase to achieve CE. I think they should aim for at least 5% instead of 1-2% that I've seen
[1:14:54] hotmanpop: xxd
[1:14:54] trevor_sub: @Maximum i feel like the tuning is a result of Emerald nightmare but they took 2 tiers to do something
[1:14:58] siremoualbou: It was true for Halondrus, Anduin, Rygelon, Jailer, Raszageth, Neltharion, Sarkareth, Tindral and Fyrakk mate
[1:15:00] TommySeeker: yo this is bringing some crazy people in chat
[1:15:05] TL_izPanda: I genuinely do not understand the mindset that "everyone should be able to clear mythic". Its OK to not be able to do the pinnacle achievement of a game
[1:15:08] BipolarPongal: @fleks27 calm down, professional
[1:15:08] surpriseparty20: Echo and Liquid suffering from success KEKW
[1:15:09] iloveuminkey: hahaa
[1:15:11] tow996: thats a long one
[1:15:15] rustandsawdust: Why not have a raid level above Mythic, that doesn't have power rewards, but tuned for the .1% competition guilds?
[1:15:17] Christofuhr: Which is stupid
[1:15:17] zeroni132: Am I crazy but how is that a problem? If they tune the raid for professionals that means its good for all the players no?
[1:15:22] chadderz7: @fleks27 professional wow player xdd
[1:15:23] Probab1e: You're Spiders Georg @Maximum outliers that normally should not be counted
[1:15:24] Xarconos: @Maximum my guild was the last guild to get cutting edge on sark in USA
[1:15:30] Lirnril: maximum et al ruining the game by being too smart and hot
[1:15:32] fronkacean: @zeroni132 not exactly...
[1:15:33] divine_killjaeden: Holandres reck everyone
[1:15:37] BipolarPongal: ICANT
[1:15:37] TommySeeker: that's a dick
[1:15:37] Emerphish: @Xarconos o7
[1:15:38] CloudyHS: CAUGHT
[1:15:38] Lyonidus: not everyone needs to clear mythic
[1:15:40] Zartirian: fuck it, make mythic impossible for 99.9999999% of players. git gud or git heroic geared
[1:15:40] iloveuminkey: tindral ResidentSleeper
[1:15:41] TomiMaroni: Looking
[1:15:41] chadderz7: xdd
[1:15:42] kaychixo: professional
[1:15:43] Attorneyatlawl: smold
[1:15:46] fleks27: can you shorten prof player as PP
[1:15:46] LuciFeariUm: volocross
[1:15:47] BlazinHurricane: CAUGHT
[1:15:47] fleks27: thanks
[1:15:48] huntermaster_95: First month of the raid being out the last bosses are made for RWF, then they nerf them by 20%
[1:15:50] BipolarPongal: Can we add an emote for "Professional"
[1:15:51] Tovone: 0,1 % isn't all people and shouldnt be balanced aorund those ppl
[1:15:51] Cobelarus: CAUGHT
[1:15:51] Quiznuhtodd: If you're good enough, you can do Mythic. If you can't just do other difficulty. Like what
[1:15:52] Byggareebob: they need to nerf things like tindral and fyrakk faster thats it
[1:15:54] SovexFFXIV: Madge sorry but I can't afford to pay for a weak aura guy to write code for me 24/7
[1:15:54] monster_mg: its solved if they dont put any bis loot on the last 2 bosses imo
[1:15:54] Missingiscool: so yall just blazing past halondrus then
[1:15:55] Icydeadppl23: i love the cringe everytime he says professionals XD
[1:15:55] tenassity69: who the fuck was sludgefist for
[1:15:56] Therealbrokensword: @zeroni132 there are people who dont put in the hours echo and liquid did in 2 weeks across the entire tier
[1:15:56] Artheeri: did Max just pronounce that boss the right way??
[1:15:59] markeexy: doomerGOLD KEKW
[1:15:59] ikMaxx: Max game is overcomplicated withj tons of buttons and things to improve, so they created the skill disparity issue
[1:16:00] NotD4k: the only thing i dislike is private auras RAGEY
[1:16:05] ampliDude7: classic class war. blame the "professionals" instead of the people who actually make the game ICANT
[1:16:09] ThisIsAsabel: who does mythic raiding to begin with, people take months to clear Heroic
[1:16:11] dwolf010: make mythic cosmetic only? then not everyone needs to clear it who wants the highest gear
[1:16:12] fronkacean: shout out poddy
[1:16:14] CloudyHS: ion monkaHmm
[1:16:17] SamyO93: I feel so bad listening to you buddy
[1:16:18] darkgorgon: @zeroni132 cause last 3 bosses are super hard, and you get less power by re-clearing so for "non elite guilds" would take more time as they are worse and get less power from reclears ( i think)
[1:16:19] hectabit: git gud
[1:16:20] iloveuminkey: ion GoatEmotey
[1:16:21] trevor_sub: the problem is you kill the guilds in the middle
[1:16:26] Baahumbug: its a skill issue maximumDabbing maximumDabbing
[1:16:27] Vis4vengeance: Is there a problem with being 6/9 m?
[1:16:27] MattOogle: @TL_izPanda I don't thhink absolute slobs should be able to clear any content. But content should be clearable at some point by almost everyone. It gives people obtainable goals to work towards.
[1:16:30] Spartany25: Blizz can make the raid for the world first AND for everyone else as well. It's not an either or
[1:16:30] jesuslouise: EZ
[1:16:30] BipolarPongal: OMEGALUL
[1:16:32] Gazmango09: I dont get what asmon is saying though? normal is still really easy its not like people cant do the raid
[1:16:34] Metaphix: hmmm lol
[1:16:38] flow_mein: mathematically impossible
[1:16:41] Missingiscool: cringe take from ion
[1:16:42] swo12: EZ
[1:16:42] azoozi_ttv: guy sounds in love
[1:16:45] neilio77: Make the raid have a M+ and rtwf can rush to 20
[1:16:45] Kryous: @fronkacean Shoutout to the editor of the PoddyC Clap
[1:16:47] alvesol: true
[1:16:49] encharmie: ion glazing pog
[1:16:50] lieutenantdan416: fake email LUL
[1:16:52] p_aradan: Just call them dedicated players, that's closer to the truth in most cases
[1:16:53] prestonrayne: so ion is bad at his job? got it
[1:16:55] Zartirian: LUL
[1:16:55] fronkacean: @Kryous amen dorki is popping off
[1:16:56] Attorneyatlawl: ff14 dev team can do it
[1:17:00] menzlo: They need to crank it down faster
[1:17:01] MajorFrog225: but why does it have to be so hard and then they slowly nerf so other people can clear it
[1:17:08] NotD4k: @ThisIsAsabel a lot of guilds KEKW , heroic is pretty easy nowdays since u can farm all ur gear from m+ technically
[1:17:09] Franiio: Just give us 10 Man raid back :D
[1:17:09] Thasin22: i just dont think they should be tuning like that
[1:17:11] ThisIsAsabel: @Maximum are there ways for your guilds to pass knowledge and help the raiding community to sorta catch up, even a tiny little to your skills?
[1:17:15] Fluffsweater: They balance in health percents too for most mechanics too I believe
[1:17:16] SovexFFXIV: @Attorneyatlawl ff14 mechancis work in a completely different way
[1:17:17] biglonelytv: is that not weird lol
[1:17:18] Guffels: I have been in 3 guilds that disbanded this tier over how little people enjoy tindral prog
[1:17:20] alvesol: @MajorFrog225 this
[1:17:22] stumie: @attorneyatlawl yea every fight is a dance ofc
[1:17:22] Destrolisher: @Attorneyatlawl yeah because it's easier than mythic
[1:17:22] uncred95: @Attorneyatlawl ofc they can. everything is the same in that game
[1:17:23] fokare: classic Naxx is exactly this, which Asmon loooved
[1:17:26] Larshouma: "Mechanics" LMAO, you have people dedicated to create Weakauras in the RWF, WEAKAURAS BRO, an ADDON, that 99% of people don't care about
[1:17:27] xGaryTv: xGaryTv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:17:28] Kryous: @fronkacean KEKW That cat couldn't edit its way out of a paper bag
[1:17:28] sandpigeon: @Attorneyatlawl WoW is way more complicated than FFXIV
[1:17:29] Metaphix: how far would it drop back down without WA @Maximum
[1:17:37] siremoualbou: It feels like sht to kill a boss that has been nerf multiple times.
[1:17:39] hawk748: remove weakauras and addons ppl will be clicking their spells again
[1:17:42] Larshouma: Race to Weakauras First
[1:17:43] malavander: ff14 doesn't have a weak aura arms race to factor in
[1:17:50] synathos: Sire D?
[1:17:51] Trollolololed: Trollolololed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! Pog
[1:17:52] texazbandit: yeah addons need to go tbh
[1:17:54] KaisenSiru: The Jailer Pog
[1:17:55] waelrick: live for an hour and 15 minutes and 6 minutes into the video AINTNOWAY
[1:17:56] Cobelarus: Jailer TrollDespair
[1:17:57] Wikedlyrics: @Attorneyatlawl XIV blind releases raids that are a choreographed dance you have to blind learn are you comparing even remotely?
[1:17:58] diabetesman1: they are challenging the top 1-2% of players making it very bad for the other 99-98% of the players
[1:17:58] Tovone: DBM and weakauras are a huge problem, remove those addons and its way harder for everyone
[1:18:03] Zartirian: blizz should ban weakauras
[1:18:04] scrubbybubbles42: Jailer TrollDespair
[1:18:08] xGamingWithMusic: how is FFXIV raiding for casual compared to professional @maximum ?
[1:18:08] NotD4k: Private auras suck tho
[1:18:09] gzok__: the only part of the raid that people LIKED during the race was the two bosses tuned for the RWF.... remember all the dooming about how EASY the raid was prior to tindral? @Maximum
[1:18:09] nomadicpulsar: @waelrick  ICANT
[1:18:09] Christofuhr: If the raid takes longer than a week it's way too hard. Any raid that takes longer for a guild that can hire someone to make WAs is going to be miserable for normal CE guilds. Period. Full stop.
[1:18:10] traisc: it's easier to tune for 8 players than 20 admittedly
[1:18:18] muffe100: @Zartirian civ take
[1:18:22] SpaEngi: Sadge
[1:18:22] Graviits: This will surely be a youtube video right?
[1:18:23] texazbandit: the 99% is what matters not the 1%
[1:18:25] MajorFrog225: what about halondrus
[1:18:26] pabu_xd: Jailer lore wise = lame - jailer fight though pretty cool ngl
[1:18:26] zeroni132: @Therealbrokensword absolutely I agree with that but if you want the "hardest" content you should put in more time? If  not HC is good enough
[1:18:26] Cobelarus: TLcrabRave I matter
[1:18:29] Line_0: Just tuned out for a bit, what is that drawing LUL
[1:18:33] gwenmh: adding make the game more fun to play ICANT
[1:18:35] biglonelytv: thats 4Weird
[1:18:38] texazbandit: cap
[1:18:39] Byggareebob: thats why they have to be nerfed faster after ur done
[1:18:41] tshell10_: Castle Nathria was such badass raid
[1:18:42] MajorFrog225: Halondrus?
[1:18:42] Emerphish: TLcrabrave
[1:18:43] Metaphix: real time tuning and stuff
[1:18:44] Fluffsweater: I'm excited for the next Expansion since we get to kill our Guildies boss. I will say DEVs do get sad when there bosses fall over due to not being able to test properly
[1:18:46] scrubbybubbles42: i dont like the myhtic igira WA mexhanic
[1:18:50] sadalxx: They tune PvE for the top 0.01%. They tune PvP for the top 0.01%. Combine that with the fact those 99% of those players the game is tuned for, require specific addons, game breaking macros, and weak auras to play the classes for them at this point.
[1:18:50] fokare: @tovone brother DBM was made and allowed because players were using literal stopwatches for bosses. People will use shit to make fights more manageable
[1:18:50] Tabun_Time: I see some saying remove weakauras or remove addons if they did that 35%+ would just quit wow /shrug
[1:18:51] Starforkx: @Graviits nah, you have to stay here for the next 7 hours while he covers this
[1:18:51] Madcatmk02: @MajorFrog225 They admitted in Sepulcher that would be the last time they try and make the raid for RWF. BECAUSE of things like halondrus
[1:18:51] mrmsix6: why dont you just get zack on a call and hash this out?
[1:18:53] ThisIsAsabel: @NotD4k in my xp (but i stopped at mid shadowlands), ppl needs full raid clear HF to get into Pugs, they get rejected, and tbf most M+ full itemized players are clueless in raid mechanics,
[1:18:55] antipheonixna: what if mythic raid came out a bit later but no mythic mechanics were tested on the ptr. Would cut down splits, they'd know how much gear youd have going in, every boss you have something new to experience when it drops
[1:18:57] Cobelarus: TLcrabRave TLcrabRave TLcrabRave
[1:18:58] NotD4k: @scrubbybubbles42 u dont need a WA for igira bud
[1:19:00] Kass_SaiYaJin: they still wouldnt do it
[1:19:00] noirlol: KEKW
[1:19:00] zerossussy: xdd
[1:19:01] knersh_: tindral was fun too watch too
[1:19:02] Larshouma: Remove any data trackers from the game and you will realise that 99% of "professionals" are bots
[1:19:08] BipolarPongal: Yeah, but top 100 is a stretch
[1:19:08] Thasin22: Idk why they just tune raid boss on tourny realm and just give access to echo and liquid and tune live for the majority
[1:19:10] fleks27: would just be a game without challenge
[1:19:13] ArcaneSyntax: You can tell they design the last two for rwf because they nerf the last two bosses like 3-4 weeks into the tier.
[1:19:13] SovexFFXIV: nah fuck that, Tindral is way more fun than Smoldi
[1:19:15] Artheeri: 3 second seeds were diabolical, the rest i can get behind
[1:19:17] noirlol: race = wants me to play the game, everytime
[1:19:17] Rafix1301: the brick die would pass out
[1:19:20] dolgare: dolgare subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[1:19:23] yeyanow: The race would be more of a speedrun then
[1:19:24] PurpleKami: @Larshouma projecting OMEGALUL
[1:19:28] Ignite_CLO: What asmongold wants is a molten core where you kill everything in 1 hours and get the best gear. Period
[1:19:29] knersh_: @noirlol same
[1:19:30] MrDread: @Larshouma what is this civilian take
[1:19:31] diabetesman1: even naow said he hated tindral/fyrakk cause only thing they was doing was waiting on getting yours and echos weakauars
[1:19:32] Konsu3: i think the last rwf gave retail big hype
[1:19:34] vannerosenpai: @Larshouma you're the bot, people can use all the WA and addons in this world and they are never going to compete against a top10 guild LUL
[1:19:39] Spartany25: last 2 bosses should drop no loot. It's all for the achievments
[1:19:39] Probab1e: @noirlol I'm a sucker like that too
[1:19:44] siremoualbou: Being forced to wait for the nerf is bad anyway. It's not natural
[1:19:48] fleks27: @Larshouma you rip some bangers man big props on the bait game
[1:19:48] noirlol: mmo without a challenge is just scuffed
[1:19:50] nomadicpulsar: @MrDread calling this a civilian take is very polite
[1:19:51] doublemeatpalace: They just need to give options to do bosses pre nerfs
[1:19:51] charliezarrdd: @Konsu3 fr i resbbed
[1:19:52] JWallace: the rwf is amazing and I would be so upset if raids became easier and ruined that experience. it’s like watching sports, I don’t really care if I can’t do what the athletes are doing, I enjoy the spectacle
[1:19:54] elirank9: if the boss are alot easier will we see less splits
[1:20:02] valdekius: a massive number of the issues that people take with this would be solved if gear capped out at heroic and mythic was transmog / achievement, because it would just be a fun extra and people wouldn't feel blocked by it as much I reckon
[1:20:06] nathkin: Not everyone has to be able to do the hardest content, thats why there are tiers of difficulty, like in EVERY GAME
[1:20:09] Cakerinotv: @Maximum while that is true there has been far more personal responsibility in fights than ever before which can def be frustrating for some people
[1:20:15] fleks27: as a vip (which you get for being dumb) i shall do my job
[1:20:16] NotD4k: @nathkin amen
[1:20:16] knersh_: @Konsu3 War within announcement tooXD
[1:20:17] fleks27: Remove any data trackers from the game and you will realise that 99% of "professionals" are bots
[1:20:19] zeroni132: @darkgorgon Agree with that but we have to take into consideration that they nerf bosses on a weekly base
[1:20:22] Fluffsweater: What about the people that want to parse?
[1:20:23] CloudyHS: Remove any data trackers from the game and you will realise that 99% of "professionals" are bots
[1:20:28] BipolarPongal: Is that the Burj Al Arab Pog
[1:20:29] freehawk1: Where's my vip?
[1:20:29] DranixOverlord: Remove any data trackers from the game and you will realise that 99% of "professionals" are bots
[1:20:30] fronkacean: @Fluffsweater aug
[1:20:34] MajorFrog225: we killed it because they made the boss easier
[1:20:35] faythes68: what if blizz made normal/heroic for the mayority/citizens and make mythic more homogeneous difficult with a later release to kill splits and not giga nerf the raid.
[1:20:40] Neutronic1: the question is how many people are in those two groups
[1:20:43] GrimFandango: Remove any data trackers from the game and you will realise that 99% of "professionals" are bots
[1:20:44] SovexFFXIV: don't nerf bosses, buff players instead.
[1:20:45] texazbandit: yall got weakuras lmao
[1:20:47] chadderz7: Aware
[1:20:49] Missingiscool: gear is supposed to fix it, but with splits and degen stuff, there is no such ilvl improvment over time
[1:20:50] Onyo1337: we killed "fixed" zskarn the week before you could bait traps, felt so fricking good
[1:20:50] Elswango: how about a stacking dmg buff like icc or the WoD legendary rings?
[1:20:50] misran: @nathkin if they didn't touch tswift or fyrakk there'd be like 15 guilds that have full cleared.  there is a middle ground there
[1:20:50] Fluffsweater: Stop nerfing my pad
[1:20:52] aescend_: i like the race but i also like playing the game, no good solution imo
[1:20:52] Starforkx: @fleks27 they prefer the term "androids"
[1:20:52] Metaphix: not everyone but more ppl
[1:20:53] brosciencegym: toadphKek toadphKek toadphKek
[1:20:57] Larshouma: @vannerosenpai dah dah "you're the bot", top10 guilds ? You mean top10 group of people that can afford to do thousands of pull everyday ? Yep sorry man, I'm playing a game, not giving up my life
[1:20:58] fronkacean: take weak auras from these so called professionals and its all over.
[1:20:58] Mani1301: @Maximum do you put a chromie in to allow you challenge prenerf?
[1:20:59] Gritalian: they have that already, it's called normal raid
[1:20:59] Elliham: lose all your players
[1:21:00] Protoman_702: if it was just a challenge mode with no gear just achievements/prestige would there be a need to nurf it?
[1:21:02] chaos_terrain: there are 3 easier difficulties lol
[1:21:05] camftw: I had so much fun watching GW2 RWF on the most recent boss, and that is a game where RWF doesnt have a large presence. That type of content pulls a lot of interest in everyone imo.
[1:21:05] gwenmh: this reminds me of people complaining in league of legends that there aren’t any point and click cc guys for crayon eaters like there used to be
[1:21:06] wademoney3590: As someone who has CE and all the Legend titles in ff14 Rvoker is definitely the play...dont even @ me no cap - I can't believe Daddy God Ion would even think that Yoshi P would even consider putting an extra class in his game. Your Buttons do Potency ? My buttons smash meters. I can honestly say that I have been raiding for years and the RTWF should come naturally to everyone, even @wowgrandma. Goodnight, love and kisses.
[1:21:06] DamagedWoW: @fronkacean one day we'll get legion and bfa classic and we can parse again
[1:21:08] whitexscale: Give raids the m+ vibe
[1:21:08] husquatch: take away weak aurs. fixed
[1:21:08] texazbandit: take away weakuras
[1:21:09] nathkin: people would quit in weeks rather than months then
[1:21:09] vannerosenpai: @texazbandit evreyone can use weakaura LUL
[1:21:10] brienmusic: the top 1% beating the boss first day means that the rest at least have a chance to beat in the first month
[1:21:12] whitexscale: Harder and Harder
[1:21:17] BipolarPongal: @fronkacean my boomer brain won't be able to handle
[1:21:19] cornygerman: Also the first bosses always get waaay easier with gear , so blizard is making sure people that cant do the later bosses from the start will take some time to get there and then they nerf them, which makes sense
[1:21:19] Christofuhr: You guys cleared Aberus super fast and it was still hard for most CE guilds so that's just factually wrong @Maximum
[1:21:19] foxsunalpha: Dropping by homie @Maximum
[1:21:20] elirank9: why doesnt ff raids dont get nerfed ?
[1:21:23] lordsellia: Thing is, we don't all have that much time per week, 400+ pulls on bosses is extremely difficult to not only do but maintain a static 20 man roster for us nobodies
[1:21:23] knersh_: I will never clear mythic and that is fine I go for curve
[1:21:28] Tovone: raid to worldfirst would be way more enjoyable for me to watch if it took 1 day
[1:21:29] Fridgeycake: If they made mythic easier I think I would stop playing and i'm 3-4 weeks off a race to world last guild
[1:21:30] guynormally: if every boss is RWF level but no gear drops, that would be hype
[1:21:31] Line_0: If it's too easy it's not fun either
[1:21:31] The9thChevron: I think the raid needs to be released with two tunings ready to go. The RWF tuning and a more manageable tuning for post RWF.
[1:21:36] texazbandit: @vannerosenpai they have professionals on the side that do the weakuras for them though lol
[1:21:38] traisc: what takes Echo and Liquid a day will still take the rest of us 2 months
[1:21:39] Luntylol: everyone should stop sucking and being boomers and just get good
[1:21:43] Robohobbo: But Fated solved this with Dinars
[1:21:43] Brewnelle: I think changing mythic to not provide ilvl upgrades and just give epic cosmetics is the the best way to fix most problems with difficulty
[1:21:45] FFR_Secut0r: Is always so weird when it comes to mythic, WoW players really never are happy
[1:21:48] Boreall: WoWs playerbase has a hard time accepting that they don't NEED to clear Mythic
[1:21:50] gwenmh: ff raids do get needed, p8s was nerfed
[1:21:53] noirlol: lockout + 20 man makes it a bit scuffed, its not too hard
[1:21:54] Sothis_best_girl: mythic raid should be like the ultra encounters in FFXIV tbh
[1:21:54] foxsunalpha: I agree mythic raiding in WoW is far to easy to me.
[1:21:54] jjwallababy: people act as if they would get world first if they had the same weakauras liquid/echo do ICANT
[1:21:56] spivet: if its not hard then why even have it? heroic exists
[1:21:56] AlphasaurusRexx: @Larshouma you can raid 6 hours a day and get cutting edge bud. the fuck are you on about.
[1:21:57] bloodsnaill: when I pug in sod I can explain how to move backward and forward 6 yards for 30 minutes and 10 wiped and people still won’t move
[1:21:57] CloudyHS: there are difficulties for a reason
[1:22:01] noirlol: ICANT
[1:22:03] CloudyHS: that would suck
[1:22:04] Welsy_: Yes
[1:22:04] 10fpsr4nn: so much focus on end-game when lvling is in shambles
[1:22:05] NotD4k: boring raid
[1:22:06] Madcatmk02: I would hate that
[1:22:07] ThisIsAsabel: i like that there is a domain in Wow that's REALLY difficult and not accessible so easily to everyone
[1:22:08] noirlol: this would be cringer
[1:22:11] doublemeatpalace: Remove gear from mythic, keep it extremely difficult, and only give cosmetics.
[1:22:13] jjwallababy: firstGarf
[1:22:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @Larshouma 6 hours per week i meanXD
[1:22:14] SideOf6: if people didnt want a challenge, why do keys over +20
[1:22:15] mysduck: that would be so boring
[1:22:15] Konsu3: @Boreall they will ever have. i will never forget ppl wanna have mythic ilvl gear from worldsquests.
[1:22:15] Madcatmk02: I race for world last I would hate it
[1:22:15] thenateo2: nobody wants that
[1:22:16] fdb33: ya but in retail u can get 99% of bis outside of raid whereas inc lassic the only gearing path is through raid
[1:22:18] Protoman_702: its too hard my dad guild got absolutely bodied by kazzara to the point they refused to even set foot in mythic again
[1:22:18] trevor_sub: i dont think that would be that bad
[1:22:18] KamkazeV2: How can it be the case that BiS is really hard to get in current raids, and ALSO that raiders are at "90% of their power" in a week?
[1:22:19] Cobelarus: Kappa
[1:22:19] foxsunalpha: Mythic raiding is super easy.
[1:22:21] Fridgeycake: I think they just wouldn't be able to nerf Smolderon, it'd be boring
[1:22:23] thenateo2: CN maybe>
[1:22:23] darkgorgon: @zeroni132 yeh true, i like the idea of having most of the items from mythic raid being BIS, so that makes re-clears seem more useful at least :D But who wants haste versa gear as a dps :(
[1:22:24] CloudyHS: abberus
[1:22:24] BipolarPongal: @jjwallababy as someone who has CE every tier, I can easily take JPC's place
[1:22:24] Robohobbo: Aberrus
[1:22:24] Madcatmk02: Emerald Nightmare fucking SUCKED and EVERYONE hated it
[1:22:25] biglonelytv: whats the matter with that lol
[1:22:26] JWallace: people would clear the raids really fast and stop playing sooner
[1:22:26] Metaphix: he's say ulduar prolly
[1:22:26] mysduck: ICC Kappa
[1:22:28] Slapsstick: people are just entitled to be able to clear mythic for some reason
[1:22:30] Quiznuhtodd: Probably Onyxia for him
[1:22:31] azoozi_ttv: Sanctum
[1:22:31] Greannan: Sarkareth felt fine
[1:22:31] zenkodac: Probably nighthold i assume
[1:22:32] BobAwesome: Nylotha
[1:22:33] Bryyo: @maximum isn’t that the point of heroic?
[1:22:33] DamagedWoW: smolderon being the last boss would be fine AS LONG as there were way more constant content releases
[1:22:34] Mitune: Betting emerald nightmare
[1:22:34] vannerosenpai: @texazbandit ok and? are you competing in the RWF? It's a non issue for most people
[1:22:34] Neomagam: what if the last 2-3 bosses didnt give gear? so BiS was easier than CE
[1:22:35] Luntylol: normal raiders discussing mythic raiding KEKL i cant
[1:22:37] Therealbrokensword: @Maximum should the last two bosses come with an extra difficulty that only gave an achievement and the "real mythic" is a lot easier than it is now
[1:22:37] nextt03: @maximum Any shot you move the chat up so it doesn't overlay asmonds chat?
[1:22:38] Attorneyatlawl: I’ve had 4 guilds die this expansion in the world 500 range, 3 of them on tindral and one on sark
[1:22:40] Rendlaws: sark was good
[1:22:41] zenkodac: He just mentioned it
[1:22:42] diabetesman1: The game isnt a mmorpg anymore and i think thats the major problem for ppl
[1:22:43] Churchtrill: If the raid released in a nerfed state would it remove heroic splits?
[1:22:43] Destrolisher: true
[1:22:43] noikex: this raid would be better if it ended at smolderon
[1:22:44] JanSladkovsky: Hellfire Citadel was great
[1:22:45] noirlol: doomer takes who dont even play the game
[1:22:49] Xarconos: @Maximum abberus was really well balenced. Rashok is a prime example of a fight you had to learn and was difficult
[1:22:50] thegrt13: I want the hardest boss to be smolderon. but with incredibly tight tuning that its more performance based rather than waiting for the last guy to get it
[1:22:51] TheSHAYdynasty: mythic raiding isnt difficult, its finding 20 ppl who are equally skilled to progress at a reasonable pace
[1:22:53] Manu7: mythic Sludgefist(?)
[1:22:53] noikex: last 2 bosses are cringe
[1:22:54] rios1k: His takes are extremely resident sleeper at this point, can
[1:22:54] huntermaster_95: Uldir felt good
[1:22:54] 1_blase: he could even clear nathria in normal mode KEKW
[1:22:55] Lyonidus: cata raids are too hard for him
[1:22:56] rios1k: cant lie
[1:22:58] grimdark_dork: He does heroic day one with chat, if he can't complete it, it's a shit raid.
[1:22:58] nerefwow: if the hardest boss was smolderon literally 300+ guilds instantly have zero challenge in the whole raid.
[1:22:59] yeyanow: What takes are drama farming too?
[1:23:02] Hop33nder: @Maximum what would you think about capping gear at heroic and make all mythic bosses hard and give a special reward for clearing mythic raids
[1:23:02] grozzarr: take gear out of mythic
[1:23:05] Metaphix: sepulchur too
[1:23:05] inyska: I think asmongold used to have decent takes, but now that he barely plays wow, and he has such a large audience, he just says whatever because he feels like he has to have an opinion instead of just saying "i don't play this game enough to haev an opinion anymore"
[1:23:06] spivet: @Churchtrill if it released nerfed they would walk in and one bang everything
[1:23:06] Xarconos: @Maximum all bosses should strive to be Rashok
[1:23:08] Attorneyatlawl: they still need to nerf it
[1:23:09] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[1:23:11] rhino_u: the hardest part about mythic raiding is getting consistent attendance from 20 people
[1:23:11] Vis4vengeance: So should everyone be able to clear the hardest modes is games depending on differing levels of skill?
[1:23:11] CloudyHS: xdding
[1:23:12] bolibombi: KEKW
[1:23:12] MajorFrog225: raids shouldn't be nerfed routinely,  terrible game design.

[1:23:24] antipheonixna: what if every boss was smolderon level except final but you didnt know the mythic mechanics till you went in?
[1:23:25] Thealzki: the current tuning on the last 2 bosses are pretty good imo, from a world 500 perspective
[1:23:25] Docaan: Max is getting tilted

[1:23:29] Greencaps07: i wonder how wow would look like if they took a page from OSRS, coming out with harder version on the content few months later/ adding cosmetic piece
[1:23:29] timmayb166: it’s gonna continue to get worse lol
[1:23:29] knersh_: fucking professionell ghouls XD

[1:23:31] noirlol: ye, its sad
[1:23:32] DranixOverlord: HAH

[1:23:42] StarShopping95: professional HAH
[1:23:44] nomcarver00: he talks in a very demeaning manner when it comes to things he disagrees with

[1:23:47] darkgorgon: Max gets triggered and rewinds 5 seconds to hear it again :D
[1:23:47] chadderz7: HAH
[1:23:48] lieutenantdan416: samesies LUL
[1:23:48] MxiTTV: Asmon is literally shit at the game though

[1:23:49] deadie3D: he is criticizing blizzard not you guys
[1:23:49] showerbees: I have been waiting for you to react to this all day
[1:23:50] bloodsnaill: we need to address this gamer on gamer violence
[1:23:50] Docaan: He repeats it for Max KEKW
[1:23:52] talkley: ??????
[1:23:52] zerossussy: he talks in a way where his viewers will always agree even if his opinion is bad
[1:23:54] zerossussy: KEKW

[1:23:56] BipolarPongal: ICANT
[1:23:56] breadwilton: lmfao
[1:23:56] CloudyHS: thats such a stupid fucking take
[1:23:57] sarrowzthewarlock: i got called a prefessional gamer cause i clear aotc every tier lmao
[1:23:57] bayazijr: Disagree
[1:23:57] talkley: L take

[1:23:59] 1_blase: KEKW WTF
[1:23:59] chadderz7: OMEGALUL
[1:23:59] sedael: thats insane
[1:23:59] zenkodac: Bad take
[1:24:00] TL_izPanda: that is such a horrible take
[1:24:00] BurntMrWaffles: so wrong
[1:24:00] NotD4k: the yap is insane
[1:24:00] Hehyioss: ????
[1:24:01] pseudo75: Dentge
[1:24:01] noirlol: its so hard for WoW, its not final fantasy
[1:24:01] ampliDude7: this is a safe space max, there are no professionals in here
[1:24:01] gwenmh: mmmm
[1:24:01] Therealbrokensword: NAH
[1:24:02] Zarackaz: biggest L take ever
[1:24:02] Zartirian: ?????????????
[1:24:03] swo12: TRUE
[1:24:04] Emerphish: he's so serious about it too LUL
[1:24:04] Frilner: What a scowly face
[1:24:04] KamkazeV2: He is literally only who he is because of playing/streaming WoW as a profession
[1:24:04] Jnxz: ideally
[1:24:04] Cakerinotv: yeah i dont think he really understands the implications of that
[1:24:05] yeyanow: Lol naive take
[1:24:05] aithran: ICANT literally the most idiotic takes of all time
[1:24:05] Gritalian: He's trying to appeal to people by making it "us" vs "them" while arguing the game is being made for literally 75 people in the world. It's such a bad faith argument.
[1:24:05] gankeds: so icc was shit then lol
[1:24:05] leubinator: just make all bosses piss easy
[1:24:05] mysduck: Dentge
[1:24:05] Kaiist: Dentge
[1:24:05] Wikedlyrics: so BC and Classic where super failures then
[1:24:06] brammertime: let him cook
[1:24:06] warpless: when does he get to the part about professional players in hot tubs
[1:24:06] Greannan: thats overcooked
[1:24:07] alvesol: not a good take
[1:24:08] theweirdsquiggly: bad bad bad take
[1:24:10] Khorvan: truly awful take
[1:24:10] RenegadeHeals: always loved the way people put it before, he talks like dumb people think smart people sound
[1:24:10] Darksynth: just be perfect HAH
[1:24:10] zerossussy: Dentge
[1:24:11] HeffaBear: thats just chat bait
[1:24:11] ysilentswordy: yeah just never fill HoF
[1:24:12] DreadfuryDK: This is rich coming from some assclown who got farmed by Botanist LMAO
[1:24:12] sinrog: very true
[1:24:13] sarrowzthewarlock: sir i am an aotc andy lmao
[1:24:13] chadderz7: Why can't I 1 shot the boss ReallyMad
[1:24:14] naicort: Dentge
[1:24:14] LuciFeariUm: people defending asmons takes looking maximumClown rn
[1:24:14] KaisenSiru: But every raid and every boss has had some sort of tuning
[1:24:17] c10starburst: would a Tourney Realm every solve this? @Maximum
[1:24:19] Arcth_: bosses on vanilla are tunned, wtf he is smoking
[1:24:20] Doimos89: Asmongol has shit takes about wow what else is new?
[1:24:20] poisonleo35: peak game designer right here
[1:24:21] burner503: @Maximum raids should get OUTGEARRED not NERFED
[1:24:21] Slapsstick: @xRby hes talked to him off the record too back at the beginning of DF
[1:24:21] BigTrout3: that'd be nice. just be perfect ya know
[1:24:21] MajorFrog225: lol how is this a bad take?  literally designed to be nerfed
[1:24:22] Cobelarus: the weapon is purely cosmetic
[1:24:22] elysona: When they nerfed the bejesus out of painsmith in SoD it completely ruined killing that boss for me...
[1:24:22] FortuneNA: I feel like even if it was tuned for pros then I would just say too bad you suck at the game go play a single player game
[1:24:22] ThisIsAsabel: half of what asmongold says is for spectacle
[1:24:24] mercs99: i thought ultimates only gave skins
[1:24:25] knersh_: tindral was way too hard and it need to be tuned XD
[1:24:26] KutchWoW: KEKW man asmon is so clueless about wow jesus
[1:24:26] zerossussy: how is his chat typing true tho KEKW thats wild KEKW
[1:24:26] CloudyHS: JUST BE PERFECT HAH
[1:24:30] JanSladkovsky: exactly, the trade off is I think blizzard coping with welll, who the fuck cares if they nerf.
[1:24:30] burner503: @Maximum raids should get OUTGEARRED not NERFED. thats his take
[1:24:32] SirPikajew: Didn't he fail to clear normal nathria early on or something? Of course this is his take lol
[1:24:32] codydoubleu: that just means the boss will be bad 7 out of 10 times if u never re-tune
[1:24:34] alvesol: how can it be balanced and good for every1 if they never nerf
[1:24:36] alvesol: how
[1:24:36] belfastcl: mythic could be that
[1:24:36] Detockz: What about introducing a limited-time extreme mode of say the last 2-3 bosses of a tier for the racers and big time gamers.
[1:24:38] Line_0: I guess they could do that if mythic didn't give gear
[1:24:38] ectocantaim: just let everyone clear it first week ICANT
[1:24:38] Spartany25: I have always thought this to be true ONLY for world first. Having to retune always has an impact on the race
[1:24:41] thenateo2: 30
[1:24:42] knersh_: 20 kills
[1:24:43] DreadfuryDK: About two dozen.
[1:24:43] targus92dd: so his take is "just make a good game"
[1:24:43] noikex: u never even killed the raid with nerfs
[1:24:44] DreadfuryDK: Maybe.
[1:24:45] CloudyHS: @zerossussy lack of braincells, cant form their own opinions
[1:24:47] Therealbrokensword: @burner503 but then every boss is a patchwerk boss
[1:24:47] gwenmh: ff ultimates get nerfed over time by potency and gear creep
[1:24:50] pekad14: but they should do a boss like that no?
[1:24:50] menzlo: The point is not ever making it wf tuning
[1:24:52] Piki9: Wow version would be Tindral and Fyrakk would be ultimates @maximum
[1:24:52] noikex: they had to nerf the bosses for u to kill them
[1:24:53] Jirofanboy: But would it not be better if mythic raid just did not drop gear?
[1:24:53] gzok__: "game devs should NEVER make mistakes or they have failed"
[1:24:53] xxjameskingxx71: FF14 is better at making evergreen content
[1:24:54] Emerphish: not even close to 20 even with the entire xpac to prog it
[1:25:00] Line_0: Remove gear from mythic then?
[1:25:00] Cyony: @Maximum i really despise asmongolds influence mainly because he's someone who will just say what ever comes to his mind without actually having an authority over it, yet his community will eat it up and people will believe it's true.
[1:25:00] Madcatmk02: @targus92dd no his take is magical christmas land.
[1:25:01] NotD4k: they just want a skill ceiling that can be reached by the smallest ones i guess KEKW
[1:25:01] motinhagmr: no. tindral is not too hard. if 60 people killed it or whatever its not hard. it is what it is, mythic raiding. my god. people are so saltyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy nowaydays because they cant do a thing thats supposed to be THE END GAME.
[1:25:04] Divinuss_: every guild doing a skyline to kill pre nerf tindrel xdd
[1:25:04] Syncronyze: i think nerfing a boss is bad, but we need to get more gear or AP to "nerf" the boss
[1:25:05] bayazijr: Aberrus BiS tuning
[1:25:05] struggs91: the dude literally doesnt play the game idk why anyone cares about his takes on a game he doesnt play. It's like Max making a video critiquing my little pony: Island adventures
[1:25:06] nathkin: yea its called classic
[1:25:08] Crystallize007: #nochanges
[1:25:11] noirlol: would be fking sick
[1:25:12] faythes68: the current nerfing is out of hand yes, but never touching the numbers is also a bad extreme
[1:25:13] ArcaneSyntax: @maximum FFXIV also scales player power linearly so it's easier for them do ilvl scaling.
[1:25:14] spinnie: put a switch in mythic mode that disabkes all nerfs? lol
[1:25:14] Baskkov: idk the guy is not a very good player, and bunch of noobs and dads listen to him
[1:25:16] バナン: Asmon is typical classic andy
[1:25:18] DamagedWoW: that just amplifies the rwf gearing problem waaaaay more than it is now
[1:25:20] wademoney3590: so crazy because ff14 is in a content droubt
[1:25:21] TheSkillest: the other way of doing it would be to give a huge ilvl progression in a patch, to ensure that combat is difficult at the start of a patch, then gradually becomes easier for a large proportion of players
[1:25:22] riddlerboy: His take is so bad, "Just never make a mistake ever, always have perfect raids"
[1:25:22] Ameratzu: challenge mode like the ones of ToGC
[1:25:24] Aro725: Do you honestly think its good time spent for Devs to make fights as hard as they are for literally like you and echo ? Even when they think you guys wont be able to do them lol
[1:25:25] warpless: asmo wants old mythic dungeons back. no rewards, cool mount tho.
[1:25:25] lingling102: with 20 ppl and a roster of 25 or so... it would be hard on the guilds and would kill them, if first iteration of tindral was still live
[1:25:26] Welsy_: I would think another difficulty would need to be added to contain just cosmetics. I wouldnt want mythic degraded to cosmetics.
[1:25:26] Missingiscool: as long as 1-2k guilds can obtain CE its fine
[1:25:27] The_Frix: remove addons would a good start
[1:25:27] zeroni132: @darkgorgon 100% that sounds amazing! But how do you solve problem like that :( Haste Vers ewww
[1:25:30] MxiTTV: Asmon's takes are always so shit
[1:25:30] Bryyo: is this guy gonna make any suggestions or just bitch cause his guild is only top 100?
[1:25:31] Theblueninjashen: @Maximum it's what gw2 do now, first vresion won't be nerf and add new difficulty
[1:25:36] c10starburst: lol
[1:25:37] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:25:41] zenkodac: since day 1
[1:25:42] Welsy_: Its just a wrong take
[1:25:43] Boreall: Bosses have needed to be retuned since Vanilla
[1:25:44] Christofuhr: It was never this bad
[1:25:44] Konsu3: they nerfed raids in tbc
[1:25:44] mantooth11: Good or bad, easier mythic would mean a lot more people interacting with mythic just for gear.
[1:25:44] herbishkehd1: 24 hour stream gettin thru this video PepeLaugh
[1:25:46] Squats3: @Maximum the low end mythic raider gets almost no gear from mythic anyway. i think it would be.. okay. might need some huge gear at the end or something
[1:25:46] wonkus1: shit takes by asmon lmao
[1:25:47] LampshadeForever: Could that do a similar structure to mythic raiding as they do for m+  like have it available to be scaled
[1:25:50] inyska: what if they make mythic raiding easier (i don't agree but what if), and they make a legendary raid tier for you RWF guilds that give a special title and cosmetics??
[1:25:53] Lyonidus: i mean, mathematically impossible c'thun
[1:25:54] DranixOverlord: He is obviously making an act here
[1:26:01] Steehll: They also used to nerf bosses and not post the nerfs
[1:26:02] huntermaster_95: Remember the hydra boss in Uldir? KEKW
[1:26:03] poisonleo35: you overtunne fights cause it's easier to nerf than buff fights
[1:26:03] huntercreeper54: wanky bar
[1:26:03] chaosreaper0: yea they've nerfed raids since vanilla
[1:26:07] Xanctius: That looks like a clay vase I once made at school
[1:26:08] c10starburst: one day we will hear his full take
[1:26:09] aescend_: i would love if they had mythic be slightly easier (difficulty caps a bit above smolderon), then 1-2 bosses that have no gear and are just a straight challenge
[1:26:09] gwenmh: also funnily enough farming the previous raid is even more useless than in wow since crafted gear is way bettter than the previous savage tier bis
[1:26:10] Morayeden: He would say even then that was a failure on Blizzard's part
[1:26:17] Isolol: He must think the incremental debuffs/buffs back in MoP weren't 're-tuning' @Maximum  KEKW
[1:26:17] DonDabon: it was worse tbh, a lot of early bosses were impossible to be done
[1:26:20] DCBen: Lich king
[1:26:21] Arcth_: LICH KING was nerfed
[1:26:22] Taytor: imagine never tuning fucking KJ
[1:26:22] wonkus1: gaming is just changing and boomers yell at clouds, this is the same as everything else in life
[1:26:23] DCBen: 5% buff
[1:26:23] Piki9: you'd have the raid up to smolderon, then Tindral and Fyrakk would be ultimates @maximum
[1:26:23] ayokay4200: chat anyone got some popcorn seasoning? i ran out PopCorn
[1:26:25] BipolarPongal: YEP Cock
[1:26:27] xxjameskingxx71: i mean they had to nerf lich king
[1:26:28] peanutz413: Does Baldman even play the game anymore?
[1:26:28] Lirnril: can't they just have a difficulty setting above Mythic that's just like Professional
[1:26:30] foxsunalpha: I just dont think it should ever be made easier. Unless no one can do the content. Then yeah I could see droping some stats. But not to a point to where gamers can fast track through the fights. Maybe WoW tunes to much?
[1:26:30] Christofuhr: The delta between Paragon and a normal guild that full clears wasn't even close to as big as the difference between you guys and WR100
[1:26:30] DreadfuryDK: The versions of WoW this clown idolizes so much saw numerous bosses get nerfed multiple times. I have no idea what bro's smoking here.
[1:26:31] vannerosenpai: I mean even the mage tower was nerfed multiple times
[1:26:31] Ionized4: that brick's about to talk
[1:26:31] picanhatv: cthun "mathematically impossible post"
[1:26:32] Emerphish: they've been nerfing bosses since AQ40 lmao
[1:26:34] ThisIsAsabel: What makes your guilds SO much stronger exactly ?
[1:26:35] fdb33: bro in wotlk they gave a 30% freaking buff so people could kill the content
[1:26:35] karthos: does no one remember the weekly stacking debuffs bosses got starting in Wrath?
[1:26:35] husquatch: how much better did people get when weak auras were introduced
[1:26:36] Jimmo24: he's saying things should be dramatically easier to the point where tuning is never required
[1:26:36] inyska: what if they make mythic raiding easier (i don't agree but what if), and they make a legendary raid tier for you RWF guilds that give a special title and cosmetics??
[1:26:36] brienmusic: intentionally buffing a boss pre release by 50% aint it
[1:26:37] Hillzor: In a perfect world what he says is just true
[1:26:37] PvtCheese: Always make them harder than they need to be and nerf them. Can you imagine if every raid tier they had to buff bosses, lol
[1:26:37] zenkodac: lich king was nerfed with everyone having a damage buff on top
[1:26:38] faythes68: a never tunned boss is either unkillable or dumb easy
[1:26:39] MajorFrog225: lol you have this take but Sepulcher was so hard your guild quit
[1:26:42] monster_mg: just make the loot attainable from both mythic and m+
[1:26:47] Aro725: @MajorFrog225 lmfao
[1:26:49] Piki9: Bad examples, but you'd get my point @maximum
[1:26:51] Welsy_: Tindral and Fyrakk are just guild breakers
[1:26:52] Xarconos: @Maximum they nerfed the hell out of SSC and TK and that is listed as a Golden raid by many. raids have ALWAYS been nerfed
[1:26:52] motinhagmr: bro, i caaaaaaaaaaant deal with this. its like, lets say orgs start to make roosters for WF. and then 400 people start clearing the raid week 2/3. would people say "oh no the game is too hard?" NO! THE GAME IS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DONT WORK FOR IT TO BE EASY.
[1:26:55] riddlerboy: Wasn't the wow "Golden era" WOTLK, and they nerfed every boss in the 1st raid?
[1:26:57] DamagedWoW: @Maximum you said even at their best, what do you think was the best raid?
[1:26:58] Coolbady: @Maximum There is Heroic-Normal difficulty for that people. How can people ask for the best gear but don't wanna face hard bosses?
[1:26:58] sedael: release tindral was beatable by ~8 guilds in the world
[1:27:04] Therealbrokensword: @Maximum you should be able to turn on release Fyrakk for an achievement and be able to try though
[1:27:04] MrAxeffect: So many raids had built in nerfs
[1:27:04] StarShopping95: HAH
[1:27:04] pabu_xd: LUL KJ fight
[1:27:05] Emerphish: @ThisIsAsabel massive skill disparity gets fueled by finanical support from orgs which allows the top raiders to put more time/energy into improving
[1:27:05] Attorneyatlawl: I think what he’s saying is they need to release bosses that don’t require massive overhauls every patch. people are coping hard if they think blizzard balance has been exceptional this expansion
[1:27:06] Squats3: you dont gear up through mythic though. most of your gear comes from M+ unless youre clearing fast.. and even then..
[1:27:08] biglonelytv: HAH Professional 󠀀
[1:27:08] c10starburst: professional HAH
[1:27:09] ikMaxx: @Maximum classes need to be easier to close the gap in skill difference, in that way you dont have the skill disparity issue to begin with and boses don't have do be nerfed that much
[1:27:10] Ionized4: HAH
[1:27:10] Greannan: thats a dogshit take
[1:27:11] CloudyHS: HAH
[1:27:12] swagggle: Max is the problem
[1:27:13] chadderz7: xdd
[1:27:16] mysduck: @Maximum why dont they just make it so you can use vault tokens for gear in mythic if you arent a mythic raider? would that not be the compromise?
[1:27:16] rukt: HAH
[1:27:17] propoopimus: why is he reacting to some mentally ill dude that wont even take a shower
[1:27:18] Docaan: You have to pause after saying Professional raiders
[1:27:19] Larocca_88: you're the problem it's you
[1:27:20] nathkin: whats wrong with a nerf after a few weeks though so you have the spectacle but then you have a killable boss
[1:27:21] DranixOverlord: HAH professional
[1:27:21] Darksynth: this guy makes money playing games HAH
[1:27:23] hotmanpop: HAH
[1:27:23] BipolarPongal: blud making this about him ICANT
[1:27:24] zenkodac: wotlk naxx is what he's talking about and everyone hated it

[1:27:28] guynormally: Max RAGEY
[1:27:28] Onyo1337: sepulcher Aware
[1:27:30] spivet: @ikMaxx or just play classic where classes have 2 buttons. fun rotations are fun
[1:27:31] fabiocoolz: xdd
[1:27:34] ifuse: I mean nerfing the boss so guilds can kill it before the holidays is just dumb
[1:27:37] IamBadSry: @ayokay4200  KEKW
[1:27:37] grozzarr: crab jam
[1:27:38] SovexFFXIV: HAH NEXT EXPANSION VILLAIN
[1:27:41] Clush___: @Maximum asmon doesnt ever fault you for being the professional raider, thats not his point
[1:27:42] The9thChevron: I miss the days were I raided to get gear for raiding not doing M+ to get gear for raiding.
[1:27:43] Piki9: Or like vault upto to echo, then razegeth would he the ultimate - that format with tuning could work @maximum
[1:27:43] Docaan: You should go bald and embrace the Villain Role
[1:27:44] vtech310: didnt there used to be a saying "DONT HATE THE PLAYER HATE THE GAME"
[1:27:45] Wh1zdumb: For me, the average guild should clear the raid in no more than 4 weeks.
[1:27:46] StarShopping95: GIGACHAD
[1:27:46] nerefwow: KEKW
[1:27:47] chadderz7: BasedGod
[1:27:47] DranixOverlord: I didn't play game since corruptions xdd
[1:27:51] Ruinx81: Why does every solution just over complicate things. Asmon already complains shit is too confusing
[1:27:51] spivet: can't believe the EU would do this to us
[1:27:52] CloudyHS: OMEGALUL
[1:27:52] moodsen: @fleks27 statement?
[1:27:52] TauruSkeleton: xdd
[1:27:53] Chrisd1991: Why not have a Normal,heroic and Mythioc mode but then have a seperate OPT IN challenge mode when you enter for RWF
[1:27:57] ThisIsAsabel: @Emerphish got it thanks
[1:27:57] Niroggo: xdd
[1:27:57] BobAwesome: That's because EU people are weird
[1:27:58] waldoishere: "Competitive" I think you mean professional
[1:27:59] manlyhandles: @Maximum remember the JB take about perfectly tuned bosses?
[1:28:01] maddrussian4: hes an idiot
[1:28:02] alex_s93: Could you just make that the last 2 Bosses drop the highest Itemelvel on Heroic so 489 for example in this Raid and in mythic they get you achievements and mounts etc
[1:28:03] StarShopping95: baseg
[1:28:03] BipolarPongal: @fleks27 PP statement?
[1:28:03] foxsunalpha: To me games are way to easy in todays time. In the past it took you way more time to reach the end boss. That was most games.
[1:28:05] Mentomorii14: make them easier but no ptr @Maximum lol
[1:28:05] CloudyHS: baseg
[1:28:08] NotD4k: skill issue imo
[1:28:08] Tanonn: get gud
[1:28:08] Zionwow: baseg
[1:28:10] malavander: you can't hit the balance bullseye without tons of data, and you dont get tons of data until its released into the wild
[1:28:11] noirlol: hard content = fun
[1:28:11] NotD4k: just get better
[1:28:11] Coolbady: Or go Heroic Normal Raid
[1:28:11] looya: isnt that just heroic
[1:28:12] bobtari: GET GOOD
[1:28:13] MeisterChiefX: utterly awful take by him
[1:28:13] MrAxeffect: What is fair, people are proging normal
[1:28:13] tumbro: skill issue LUL
[1:28:14] enigmasvea: how can asmon have a opinion when he havent played since legion? KEKW
[1:28:14] TauruSkeleton: cant wait for the asmon reaction to this video

[1:28:23] chadderz7: PepeLaugh
[1:28:24] disi_tv: I do not get what the down side is about doing it this way? Whats wrong about making it harder for the Top guilds and nerf it after?
[1:28:24] BigTrout3: KEKW
[1:28:24] Slapsstick: this is a MONKA moment
[1:28:24] aescend_: BANGER COMING BANGER ALERT
[1:28:26] Larshouma: "Get better" 600pulls to kill a boss = being better lmao
[1:28:26] Squats3: @Maximum i seriously dont get why he even has a take.. he hasnt played the game in a meaningful way in like 9 years.
[1:28:27] huntercreeper54: look at his eyes he's fuming
[1:28:28] mysduck: 2 weeks long is heat tho
[1:28:29] CloudyHS: MONKASTEER
[1:28:29] Jarlan23: i'd understand his argument if there was only one raid difficultly
[1:28:29] dullermanjaro: thats not the issue u need 19 others to also get better at the game
[1:28:33] jesuslouise: KEKW
[1:28:33] noirlol: CAUGHT
[1:28:33] BipolarPongal: LetHimJoel
[1:28:33] evan_all_mighty: i never thought i'd say this, but the system they tried where you were buffed but could turn off the buff (icc, i think mop raids had it) might be preferable to repeated nerfs. but that also assumes the bosses have mechanics that gear/power actually gets the kill instead of technical play.  could even make ce or the title only come from turning off the buff
[1:28:34] tow996: BASED
[1:28:35] AmenRamen: I like the shorter more intense races
[1:28:36] antipheonixna: i mean you could make a weekly quest that lets you upgrade your gear even higher or something thats not a blue post with nerfs
[1:28:38] uncred95: everyone bitched when the race in s2 ended in 3 days
[1:28:38] wonkus1: if blizzard did this eventually they add another difficulty lmao
[1:28:38] aescend_: baseg
[1:28:39] Tovone: shorter would be way better and better to watch
[1:28:39] comFox: alot of people
[1:28:39] JWallace: raid being easier isn’t a solution, that would make the game even more seasonal because people will run out of things to do even faster
[1:28:39] turtlebakes: look at destiny races for ex.

[1:28:53] zenkodac: nah, the bosses have to be somewhat challenging otherwise watching you 5 shot every boss would suck
[1:29:02] Attorneyatlawl: based unironically
[1:29:06] Konsu3: 900k viewer on the last rwf, it doesnt matter
[1:29:07] yeyanow: It matters for me as someone who likes to watch rwf
[1:29:07] spivet: RWF is fun as hell
[1:29:11] CloudyHS: freppn he doesnt even play the game
[1:29:13] zerossussy: the devs even watch it
[1:29:14] zerossussy: they love it
[1:29:15] JWallace: watching the rwf has brought me back into  playing wow multiple time
[1:29:15] Aro725: They literally do make the raids as hard as they are just for you guys though lol
[1:29:17] noirlol: 900k views, does not matter CAUGHT
[1:29:18] isFeyz: RWF pulls me back in the game constantly KEKW
[1:29:19] Slapsstick: RWF is the best part of the patches
[1:29:20] Larshouma: @freppn Yes sure, being better = be able to do 700pulls per boss, dah dah i'm good
[1:29:21] xRby: its the only time I interact with the game
[1:29:22] NotD4k: RWF was what got me playing the game KEKW thats prob peak time on every tier

[1:29:27] TheSHAYdynasty: @wasGsuz sneakyWave
[1:29:28] noirlol: RWF > ALL
[1:29:29] foxsunalpha: I agree its super imporant
[1:29:31] Attorneyatlawl: yea ruin the raids for advertisement great for a video game
[1:29:31] enigmasvea: Asmon has a bad take? D: its like he hasnt gamed since Legion CAUGHT
[1:29:33] Phyzene: I'm a nobody, but I only started playing because of how hype the RWF was
[1:29:33] gretriku: RWF is the the largest free advertisement Blizz gets, they 100% care
[1:29:33] biglonelytv: race to splits HAH
[1:29:34] DranixOverlord: V
[1:29:34] lack097: the reason i play the game RWF
[1:29:34] GenXGamerDad: I don't understand the problem....there are different levels of content that try to cater to the different populations of players....Is this really an issue?
[1:29:34] PurpleKami: @Aro725 you have no evidence of that to use the word literally
[1:29:34] Wikedlyrics: its marketing they don't even have to spend money on, corpo dream
[1:29:35] Isolol: Watching rwf got me playing again
[1:29:36] Vunoka: I love RWF and I'm a HARDCORE pvper
[1:29:36] chadderz7: RWF gets me to resub everytime Aware
[1:29:36] Vis4vengeance: I love rwf and it's advertising for them
[1:29:38] zerossussy: RWF is just as much fun as a new raid release itself
[1:29:40] rpgonlyforme: it is a ridiculous take
[1:29:40] vondahanner: Watching the race is quite fun
[1:29:42] TL_izPanda: its the largest event on twitch that isn't an developer sponsored esports finals tournament
[1:29:42] baddecisiondanx: The problem is the majority of players are trash and the level of challenge inherently exludes them. Now does that matter? depends who you ask, but i think that's the point of most of the normal -> aotc level raiders which are a majority of players
[1:29:43] fatbotmgrrl: RWF makes me want to be a better player tbh
[1:29:44] Lenzoface: best memory of wow in the recent years was this last RWF, it was great entertainment
[1:29:45] Line_0: Rwf is great
[1:29:45] BobAwesome: RWF is free publicity for WoW
[1:29:45] sendos_gg: RWF is so important that blizzard does not run it officially lmao
[1:29:47] itzdelusion: yall treat asmon likes never played wow in his life either, it's hypocritical from the chat on both sides.
[1:29:48] CloudyHS: ??????????
[1:29:48] Olivens: RWF is sooo HUGE in many ways
[1:29:48] kwizang_: The years race got me to return after 20 years

[1:29:51] dullermanjaro: biased af

[1:29:54] lolwhateverdog: i would not be playing the game rn if it werent for RWF getting me into it
[1:29:54] inyska: honestly asmon's opinion only matters because he has a lot of viewers, but if it were any other heroic raider of his calibre, not a single person would take him seriously.
[1:29:56] SkrrtRussel: ????? cmon lol
[1:29:56] Vis4vengeance: It's the only gaming/sports event I watch

[1:30:01] yeyanow: Rwf makes me want to get so much better at wow
[1:30:01] sabalon_tv: if the race wasnt streamed i wouldve quit for good in 8.3

[1:30:19] Niroggo: D:
[1:30:20] Draknorz: i dont even play retail and i love RWF
[1:30:21] Line_0: Casuals aren't online LUL
[1:30:21] Metaphix: EZ
[1:30:21] mxgxbx: 18s are hard to casuals
[1:30:21] mrmsix6: im so casual i dont even play the game
[1:30:22] howard_iznats: Yeah but its advertisement for the people that don't play it, and that matters more
[1:30:22] Slapsstick: skip the first two days of splits then the RWF hits like nothin else
[1:30:25] vigilantknives: 2 hours a week at most
[1:30:28] MacRant: civilians
[1:30:29] biglonelytv: yea the transmog and mount farmers dont give a shit
[1:30:29] NotD4k: @Draknorz baseg
[1:30:29] aescend_: i wish i could be a casual
[1:30:30] Ruinx81: My friend does LFR and takes it super seriously
[1:30:30] renarton: mount and mog collectors gap raiders
[1:30:32] goodmonsin: THOSE PEOPEL DONT MYTHIC RAID THO WHY WOUDL THEY CARE
[1:30:34] TL_izPanda: its super not true. Every guild I've been in gets really excited to watch the Race and takes all the strats from those guilds
[1:30:34] goodmonsin: caps
[1:30:34] mantooth11: Best way to fix raiding is aspect crests and mythic track vault rewards from heroic raids. Average guilds still get the gear and "professional" guilds still get the challenge.
[1:30:35] seangelma: i log on and play pet battles :D
[1:30:35] cobaltheal: Have a guldie that says they dont watch twitch unless its race. Does 15 tops even this season
[1:30:35] spivet: I don't think casuals who don't care about RWF are wiping on mythic fyrakk lol
[1:30:35] zerossussy: yea most ppl are like that which is odd to me because i play 12 hours a day KEKW
[1:30:38] Nekz3: i have gamer friend and they don't know that twitch is
[1:30:39] elvia_: some people are still level 50 in diablo 4 playing 2 hours a week
[1:30:39] Aro725: @PurpleKami Max has literally read a message from Ion saying they made it so difficult they weren't sure if even Limit/Echo could kill the bosses. How is that not proof?
[1:30:43] Therealbrokensword: I work with a guy like this, he literally just levels characters and stops everynow and then. He has like 40 mid level characters
[1:30:43] knersh_: normal raiders are the average
[1:30:43] biglonelytv: HAH BLIZZARD
[1:30:45] grozzarr: jaina
[1:30:47] fatbotmgrrl: Casual players don't watch Asmongold really either
[1:30:48] ninah_wtf: Haha I understand, I was one of them in legion LUL
[1:30:49] traisc: i love RWF and i still think bosses should be easier. i don't have a problem with the top guilds doing degenerate things to kill it quicker, that has no bearing on the rest of the guilds imo
[1:30:49] ayokay4200: HAH BLIZZARD IS THE VILLIAN NOW
[1:30:49] Larshouma: 10Millions WoW subscribers and 250k people watching RWF but yeah sure everyone knows what RWF is
[1:30:52] RemotheGreat36: I havent played wow in years and I still watch every rwf
[1:30:52] migilicuty: didn't asmon used to say like if you can
[1:30:53] ifuse: yeah my friend doesnt know any of these and he plays the game everyday
[1:30:55] imsorrykk: You guys decided Kappa
[1:30:56] bayazijr: Aberrus was the BiS raid length
[1:30:56] zenkodac: people are aware of raids and the notion that someone in the world did it the fast isnt that far fetched
[1:30:57] Xarconos: @Maximum there are people who havent played wow for YEARs who watch the race. I didnt play Shadow lands at all and still was watching you for the race
[1:31:00] ShowDUH: @Maximum I mean remember that Undercover raid in Castle Nathria where that girl streamer didn't what you guys did ?
[1:31:00] dwolf010: preach said that echo will die if the race is only a few days
[1:31:05] DeathlyRaiser: wasn't there a stat that showed that the majority of retail players only do raid finder for raid content?
[1:31:09] yeyanow: I am sure liquid likes a long race for that advertisement money
[1:31:11] thelzz: For me personally the problem of making the race 3-4 weeks long is that orgs wouldnt be able to bring the players to the venue and thats part of the fun
[1:31:13] bloodsnaill: ahk’madu was the last world first it took 3 weeks
[1:31:14] OldFlorrysGhost: leaked
[1:31:18] megatin: What audience is he imagining that doesn't know what the RWF is but also wants to do mythic raids??
[1:31:23] SaltWoW: @dwolf010 theyll just play na fulltime
[1:31:27] hawk748: casuals get to heroic dungeons then quit. the leveling is the game for them
[1:31:28] Line_0: I feel like a week for the race is also fine
[1:31:30] wasGsuz: @megatin based and true
[1:31:38] phiAnthony91: i think these "super casuals" dont exist. if ur still playing retail wow ur all in
[1:31:41] alarkin: The literally designed the last two bosses of this raid exclusively for the RWF, and for no one else who plays the game - so that rumor is either wrong or they changed course.
[1:31:42] zenkodac: also that consensus also came from the viewership of the raid that how the landed on 2, one reset is too short 3 is too long
[1:31:44] FortuneNA: I wonder what the game would be like if the devs were allowed to make it as hard or easy as they wanted with no backlash from players or supervisors
[1:31:47] lingling102: after sepulchre ion had that arms race statement no?
[1:31:47] nayrcraig: @megatin These are people that exist
[1:31:47] mysduck: @megatin source: i made it the fuck up baseg
[1:31:48] dwolf010: @SaltWoW no its not about the reset its about money
[1:31:58] biglonelytv: thats cringe
[1:31:59] MajorFrog225: lol sepulcher being too long killed your guild
[1:32:01] zerossussy: few days is probably still going to wokr out
[1:32:03] theweirdsquiggly: @hawk748 idk I’ve introduced people to wow and they like endgame
[1:32:06] Nekz3: nah people start doing speedruns then
[1:32:07] huntercreeper54: oh boy he's about to say the p word
[1:32:11] spivet: those sweet sweet ad dollars
[1:32:11] ItchY_val: money is why they care
[1:32:15] dubbyatt: he doesnt care = everyone doesnt care
[1:32:19] nextt03: Yeah I went to blizzcon working on heroic siegecrafter blackfuse. Was in like with people who were progressing on normal garrosh.. It was eye opening to see how casual casual is.
[1:32:21] BobAwesome: @megatin for me personally, I don't watch RWF because my guild does the raids blind and we don't want spoilers.
[1:32:24] zukohonor: the problem isnt even the race lol, all their other content is just boring for casual players
[1:32:27] belfastcl: the rwf can take many forms, nothing dictates it has to be like it is now
[1:32:27] Slapsstick: @MajorFrog225 they still got 4th and definitely arent dead, the baits solid tho
[1:32:28] PvtCheese: RWF just free advertising for WoW, why wouldn't they care?
[1:32:30] NYKO7_: how are we only on 7th minute KEKW
[1:32:32] breadwilton: asmongold is just a rage bait streamer, nothing thats comes out of his mouth matters
[1:32:33] hawk748: @theweirdsquiggly i'm jealous cause what i said is when all my friends quit lol
[1:32:33] MaybeRespect: I'll be honest Max. The race makes me NOT resub. It's interesting to watch but way too hard to entice me back.
[1:32:34] spivet: that is an extraordinarily generous reading on your part
[1:32:35] tesseract26: !liquid
[1:32:40] yeyanow: Man, has asmongold takes always been so bad?
[1:32:48] MajorFrog225: @Slapsstick im sorry, didn't they quit?
[1:32:48] FFR_Secut0r: @yeyanow yes
[1:32:50] Naaven: @PvtCheese wow has been dying for last years, i don't think this "advertising" is paying off lmao

[1:33:03] Docaan: Professional Players *pause*
[1:33:05] foxsunalpha: Why wouldn't you want it to last 2 weeks or longer? I'd like to see it last longer then it is now. Like I said, I think gaming is to easy across all platforms. Games were harder 10-15 yrs ago. @Maximum
[1:33:05] brainrot_behavior: @yeyanow feels like it recently
[1:33:05] CloudyHS: HAH professional
[1:33:06] aithran: classic rose tinted glasses
[1:33:09] Lothland: @FFR_Secut0r yeah the longer he's been removed from actually playing the game at a high level the worse it's gotten.
[1:33:11] andaroo: I mean - I think Asmon is a smart guy, but his chat attracts a certain WOW-hater demo sometimes
[1:33:12] vanicax: rwf comes when the new patch comes out no shit ppl sub
[1:33:15] DranixOverlord: HAH professional
[1:33:16] alarkin: They literally designed the last two bosses of this raid exclusively for the RWF, and for no one else who plays the game - so that rumor is either wrong or they changed course. I don't know how this is not a bad thing.
[1:33:16] BicardiTV: read the bottom line of the chat on his screen lol
[1:33:17] Wikedlyrics: he says this while his own company sponsors echo to have starforge PCs marketing up during the race, hes just grifting he knows what the race matters
[1:33:18] Slapsstick: @MajorFrog225 and then still got 4th and they definitely arent dead, i think you just dont know what dying means LUL
[1:33:18] Isolol: muru 6 nerfs thick still guild killer
[1:33:19] NotD4k: wasnt Ragnaros really hard back then?
[1:33:20] belfastcl: there always was a race to world first, it existed for molten too
[1:33:21] Syncronyze: volcoross
[1:33:22] CloudyHS: volcoross

[1:33:26] Hehyioss: Volcoross

[1:33:27] torchedwood: volcoross
[1:33:27] sarrowzthewarlock: volocross
[1:33:27] 1_blase: volcoross
[1:33:28] grozzarr: hissy boi
[1:33:30] traisc: but no one cares about anything but the last boss
[1:33:31] xspire: arguably the last two bosses are the race though let's be fair
[1:33:32] nairb1: @zerossussy ????????????????????????????
[1:33:32] Cjpriest: but thats the literal best part fo the race is the last 2 bosses so that take is kinda true
[1:33:32] Deece_: volocross gettting 1 banged by everyone
[1:33:35] isFeyz: LK25HC we killed as the 26th guild after 41 days of prog. Its been like this forever @Maximum
[1:33:36] NotD4k: Magmorax or whatever
[1:33:36] Attorneyatlawl: 0 of the bosses should be tuned for .001 of the player base
[1:33:37] NotD4k: KEKW
[1:33:38] Christofuhr: That is so obviously not what he means come on man @Maximum
[1:33:38] Zorto5: volc the loot pinata HAH
[1:33:39] Azkrust: If you think playing a game is a profession, you need to reevaluate your lifestyle choices
[1:33:43] Osterberg501: Snake boss? thought we were fighting a puddle of lava
[1:33:45] renarton: they were jokes even for late CE guilds
[1:33:45] zannuss: I say put raid atunements back in
[1:33:46] traisc: that's why Instant Dollars got world first on like 5 bosses
[1:33:47] trizzy249: Tournament realm for RtWF with set gear/ilvl could fix the "Global Release" issue as well as provide challenging content for the guilds involved. They could, in turn, crank it to 11 without having to tune fights that are too difficult for the average guild after the fact.
[1:33:48] zerossussy: @nairb1 fine after the dot nerf
[1:33:50] Aro725: @Attorneyatlawl true
[1:33:51] not_jhaycen: smoldy private auras though?
[1:33:52] Divine2987: ur slightly out of touch Smolderon was still hard for us
[1:33:52] ThisIsAsabel: so the last 2 boss of mythic raid is tune early patch for pro play. I'm not that mad
[1:33:53] MajorFrog225: @Slapsstick I didn't say they're dead, but it killed them and they basically quit.
[1:33:53] brainrot_behavior: volcoross is my goat
[1:33:56] FFR_Secut0r: I'm starting to believe that he just doesn't believe these takes and is just making them on stream for his audience to farm $$$
[1:33:57] Pyrrha_GG: it’s like saying they should make professional football easier because there’s not that many pros
[1:33:58] CloudyHS: gachiBASS
[1:33:58] Metaphix: 9/11 monkaW
[1:33:59] Monotone_Ryouta: asmon hasnt played wow since legion, being carried = playing the game

[1:34:03] ikMaxx: condom
[1:34:03] sinun57: @Maximum i mean you basically one shot the first 6 so its for sure not balanced around you
[1:34:03] sarrowzthewarlock: that drawing is getting sus
[1:34:03] HumanityDH: smolderon originally def wasnt tuned for the average CE raider.
[1:34:03] Xanctius: the condom is too big!
[1:34:04] deadie3D: tindral is a guild killer, so they are suppouse to end the raid there=?
[1:34:04] nayrcraig: What does the drawing mean?
[1:34:04] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like you could take a random 20 lfr andies into mythic and they'd at least get 3 bosses down. @Maximum
[1:34:05] Attorneyatlawl: LUL
[1:34:05] mysduck: Looking i see it
[1:34:05] traisc: YEP
[1:34:05] huntercreeper54: YEP

[1:34:10] fdb33: @isFeyz And that was after they introduced a flat % buff to everyone
[1:34:10] warpless: condom too big for erection
[1:34:11] tattedn3rdd: PP
[1:34:12] grozzarr: its only natural
[1:34:12] BigCizzle: YEP
[1:34:12] ThisIsAsabel: the two popstickles are melting Pog
[1:34:13] Line_0: Last two bosses being tuned for the race is fine because no one else will reach them in awhile anyway
[1:34:14] megatin: @BobAwesome Ah ok fair enough!
[1:34:15] einself111: so make it like 2 extra bosses like algalon that only rewards cosmetics
[1:34:16] Sch1ey: Its called art chat.
[1:34:17] bloodsnaill: when did blizzard make a penis boss?
[1:34:17] CloudyHS: @Maximum that chart looks like it just killed smolderon and is hyped
[1:34:17] tobbs94: they just failed the nerfing of tindral and fyrakk imo, all the other bosses were perfect, even smolderon. for an average mythic raiding guild.
[1:34:18] sgtshellshocka: you are trying, bless your heart
[1:34:19] TyforKarma: Can you tell me who that group of people is? (the small one)
[1:34:23] Aejique: how did he get in my drawer
[1:34:23] GooseComics: @Maximum I think he is kind of right as you yourself has said the last 2 bosses were your focus, and THOSE bosses were tuned for RWF players, not the entire raid
[1:34:29] Neztea: dawg
[1:34:29] hottfuzz24: its still hell
[1:34:30] malnourish_: the ass drawing yesterday was better imo
[1:34:31] zerossussy: tindral was so bad
[1:34:32] Onyo1337: skyline Aware
[1:34:33] shermoop: Just have an ICC style power boost every week. Won't work for all fights, such as tindral on release, but it deals with a lot of these problems
[1:34:34] bubblebazook: 20 man roster is the true difficulty curve
[1:34:37] Syncronyze: it has to be gear
[1:34:40] Slapsstick: @malnourish_ facts
[1:34:41] gyser13: better gear should nuke every boss period
[1:34:41] faet91: Ghost Gaming was in Tyndral hell for 3 months
[1:34:46] warpless: tell us more about snake shaped bosses that whip themseves at 20 men
[1:34:46] Wikedlyrics: @Naaven dying so hard they already greenlit the next 3 xpansios KEKW
[1:34:47] gyser13: like it wa sback in the day
[1:34:47] Line_0: As long as they nerf them after two weeks or so it's fine
[1:34:48] MrDread: @GooseComics max's argument is that they nerf the bosses before that group gets to it
[1:34:49] Kenigami: make professional mode that doesnt drop gear xD
[1:34:52] Zorto5: the seeds were a good change
[1:34:53] bigsockets: what if last bosses only required insane WA tech the first couple weeks?
[1:34:55] diabetesman1: i think a big reason for this being a problem is that the good players dont understand how bad the bad players are and vice versa
[1:34:56] Vis4vengeance: So bosses should be tuned so everyone can clear it week 1?
[1:35:00] VSpeed: BASED
[1:35:03] theweirdsquiggly: @tyforkarma the small group is the “race to world last” crowd
[1:35:04] AtomJar: @Naaven okay sure my dude. over 4mil char run M+ even lets say everyone is playing 4 alts thats still over 1mil doing M+
[1:35:09] brainrot_behavior: Make a professional difficulty
[1:35:11] zerossussy: @MrDread i couldn't agree more
[1:35:14] zerossussy: with max
[1:35:15] chadderz7: better weakauras xdd
[1:35:18] antipheonixna: if you didnt know any of the mythic mechanics going in that would make it harder for u but not most people @Maximum
[1:35:19] Antkiller: make mechanics that get nerfed through gear
[1:35:20] Superhank: splits
[1:35:21] Janikowski4: liquid echo are pro crankers?
[1:35:24] noirlol: give us 10man mythic + no lockout shit = GG
[1:35:29] huntermaster_95: So you want tighter berserk? @Maximum
[1:35:30] repzu_: repzu_ subscribed with Prime. 
[1:35:33] Therealbrokensword: Any one saying release Fyrakk is hurting the game is a bad take, there were like 100 players in total who got to even see that boss
[1:35:34] nayrcraig: I don't underdtand why people seperate dmg and mechanics as if they are 2 different things that don't interact
[1:35:37] JanSladkovsky: what if there would be an automatic system of some small % nerf by each guild that clears it that also exponentially decreases obv
[1:35:42] Line_0: Good point
[1:35:43] Konsu3: @brainrot_behavior 5 difficulties in the war withing MONKASTEER
[1:35:49] Cobelarus: splits TrollDespair
[1:35:52] rpgonlyforme: i think that is a major issue, yes
[1:35:53] Cakerinotv: @Maximum what if they just set you to like maximum heroic gear so they can tune around a gear deficit
[1:35:53] risettefreya: t
[1:35:55] zerossussy: but its mythic so being geared should be baseline
[1:35:55] rpgonlyforme: gear farming/splits
[1:35:56] lingling102: that is only relevant for the start of the tier tho
[1:35:58] flow_mein: get asmon on PoddyC
[1:35:59] Naaven: @Wikedlyrics they greenlit 3 patches*
[1:35:59] rottisxd: bring back heroic week with uncapped m+ ilvl
[1:35:59] MajorFrog225: isn't that ok that you farm splits?  kinda doesn't affect everyone else
[1:36:01] Zachariash: The amount of guilds who do 1 or 2 split characters these days is.. alarming
[1:36:04] risettefreya: test
[1:36:05] Gritalian: @Maximum it doesn't even take the rest of us much longer at this point.
[1:36:09] PvtCheese: Fuck RWF and boss difficulty, lets talk about how shit raid loot is for PUGs. Ive won a single roll in 5 weeks.
[1:36:09] GameteTV: make tier sets from different difficulties not work with each other and tune based on gear
[1:36:10] punkekw: Is there a boss like Tindrall that bricks guilds every tier?
[1:36:15] Therealbrokensword: I think the RWF should have its own difficulty for the final X bosses and it only gives an achieve
[1:36:17] faythes68: what if they delay mythic release till gearing farm doesn't matter?
[1:36:18] whyt0: yeah that's what he wants
[1:36:21] Crystallize007: @PvtCheese skill issue
[1:36:24] gyser13: Gear should matter more and make fights massively easier over time like it used to be
[1:36:29] zerossussy: anduin was insane
[1:36:30] Wikedlyrics: @Naaven no, they greenlit 3 expansions there is already 3 more patches greenlit in dragonflight you seem confused my dude
[1:36:30] burns____: @flow_mein he was
[1:36:30] foxsunalpha: oh yeah
[1:36:35] zenkodac: unless they made it mathematically impossible to get tier first week you guys would find a way
[1:36:36] PvtCheese: @Crystallize007 true, if only I was a professional
[1:36:36] markeexy: @flow_mein he becomes very diplomatic and passive around sensible human beings
[1:36:40] Letholas: what if they took tier out of the raid and just gave a piece every week (catalyst quest) and it upgrades over time?
[1:36:42] foxsunalpha: same

[1:36:45] minglium: stop stacking so many one-shot mechanics
[1:36:46] TL_izPanda: We also don't want 1 week. 2 weeks is ideal
[1:36:47] chadderz7: 💰
[1:36:47] TyforKarma: @theweirdsquiggly Never understood why they complain about that at all when they are literally 3/8 normal and not even trying to improve
[1:36:48] spivet: @gyser13 the only way to make that happen reliably is to make bosses that aren't actually hard
[1:36:52] nextt03: How about gear that negates a mechanic.. Like the onyxia cloak. So RWF can kill boss without the item.. But slowly it gets easier because more people get the cape
[1:36:55] MrDread: thd would fit in GIGACHAD
[1:36:55] brammertime: anduin was GNARLY

[1:37:08] Xanctius: Echo and Liquid have huuuuuge...bars
[1:37:08] IamBadSry: drawing the bricked up guy in paint KEKW

[1:37:21] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:37:24] Pyrrha_GG: destiny 2 has a contest mode for their race where your gear caps out at a certain point, maybe they could implement something like that for wow but IDK
[1:37:26] daedri: damn he went off the screen for that one
[1:37:29] surpriseparty20: Huge dick Gap
[1:37:30] thenateo2: who struggled on igira KEKW
[1:37:31] zenkodac: him acting like this is some surprising change is such a BS act its been happening for years, it was happening when he was playing the game
[1:37:32] offcuts: the weakaura and addon bloat is part of the problem tbh
[1:37:36] Bryyo: that graph is me vs you in terms of dong
[1:37:38] Dsully08: whomst stuggles on igira
[1:37:40] brammertime: what happened to BDG?
[1:37:44] PurpleKami: Balatro math, if every liquid raider is 50% better than the average world 100 guild player, the gap is gonna get massive at 20 player count
[1:37:46] Therealbrokensword: People either forgot or dont realise that the current lead raid designer got his job because Cthun was literally impossible in classic, nerfs arent new
[1:37:47] KutchWoW: KEKW struggling on igira
[1:37:47] NotD4k: KEKW
[1:37:49] JanSladkovsky: do you think that a small % nerf after each guild clears from the 1st onward could work obv small percentage with exponential decrease when the number of guilds that clear gets higher
[1:37:54] AtomJar: @Naaven you think there wont be an 11.1?
[1:37:56] Niroggo: @thenateo2 "guys im so good at the game look at me"
[1:37:57] bloodsnaill: he’s kinda talking about making sod
[1:38:02] PvtCheese: How can you have a "linear curve" linear means straight. No curves there
[1:38:06] ikMaxx: They need to make classes easier to reduce the skill gap. It shouldnt be acceptable that a guy playing his class badly can do so little in comparison to a good player
[1:38:07] BipolarPongal: That's a fat one YEP
[1:38:09] Syncronyze: @offcuts self-inflicted by blizzard though with private auras
[1:38:14] TyforKarma: I hate casuals that want to get everything handed to them without putting in any work holy shit
[1:38:21] HumanityDH: no
[1:38:21] meozart: emerald nightmare is a raid that was way under tuned and asmongold even said things about that raid
[1:38:27] traisc: there should be, but they don't seem to
[1:38:28] risettefreya: @pvtcheese a line is a curve
[1:38:32] backerxx: what about if they release another difficulty of “rwf” on top of mythic and trying to release mythic at end mythic levels
[1:38:35] zerossussy: yea tindral nerfs aren't that great
[1:38:36] vanicax: yes finally
[1:38:36] GameteTV: what if tier sets only worked in the difficulty you were in. so if you had heroic 4pc you cant use it in mythic. however you could use a heroic non-tier piece
[1:38:39] Wikedlyrics: @Naaven 1/10 troll attempt don't quit your day job
[1:38:39] HumanityDH: @traisc this
[1:38:42] Ivaed: I mean it's not a unique situation. NFL players don't play the same game as Highschool players. The rules of the game might be the same, but it's not the same game at that level.
[1:38:42] peanutz413: @tyforkarma FACTS
[1:38:45] BipolarPongal: Bosses 1-6 was meh, 7 was hard for guilds that walked through the first 6
[1:38:47] Cobelarus: Clipped and shipped NOTED
[1:38:48] noikex: why there should be a need to nerf the boss every tier
[1:38:50] gyser13: MMOs are seasonal not something you always play
[1:38:51] brainrot_behavior: "oh you killed tindral on nerf 8 huh"
[1:38:53] Divine2987: @Maximum  they do it at their own pace to time gate people into playing longer
[1:38:54] mysduck: Looking that brick...
[1:38:57] smoothlol: what shapes are these
[1:38:57] MajorFrog225: terrible game design
[1:38:58] alarkin: But Tindral and Fyrakk are still getting remarkably low kills, in March, after rounds of nerfs - so...no? They can't be trusted?
[1:38:59] nationas: its called heroic :D
[1:38:59] PvtCheese: @risettefreya dont bring your math in here xd
[1:38:59] lingling102: if blizzard could only access some professional source with the knowledge and insights required to make good decisions regarding nerfs
[1:39:00] Therealbrokensword: The reset after world fist is hit they should do DRASTIC nerfs, not gradual. Drastic.
[1:39:06] FeikaNovi: at least they care about raiding
[1:39:13] Artheeri: @Maximum what about treating Tindral also as a final boss and giving ppl the choice to do either Fyrakk or Tindral first
[1:39:14] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: @Maximum idk why we complain about mythic when 10% of wow players dont even beat heroic raids  kekw
[1:39:22] Vis4vengeance: My beer league needs to be in the world series
[1:39:24] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: 90%
[1:39:26] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: sorry
[1:39:28] meozart: I prefer them to nerf a boss instead of it being way to easy @maximum
[1:39:28] Aro725: Back in the day, the raid was clearable in the old tiers gear. Like ppl blasted ICC in TOGC gear. I feel like you guys should be able to kill the new tier in the old tiers bis gear. While getting upgrades while progressing. I feel like thats when wow was at its best @Maximum
[1:39:34] BipolarPongal: Blizzard gonna add Professional mode next xdd
[1:39:34] TyforKarma: @sir_jaaahrl_gaming EXACTLY
[1:39:35] Cakerinotv: make an auto nerf system where the bosses hp goes down by like 5% every week until anyone can kill or something lol
[1:39:37] Lara_TV_: @Maximum While that can work, it really forces people that want to challenge themselves to have to raid more and more hours per week to beat the nerfs.
[1:39:39] alarkin: And that's really really bad lol
[1:39:42] Boreall: Ragebaiter
[1:39:43] Wunshi: would making the raid lockout account wide for like 3 weeks be an option to stop splits making it so blizzard can tune the raid easier?
[1:39:47] mysduck: CAUGHT
[1:39:48] Therealbrokensword: @Maximum Raid+ and its capped at +3 or something

[1:40:30] DeathlyRaiser: its pronounced "surge-ur-as"
[1:40:31] Therealbrokensword: Dude Cthun was in IMPOSSIBLE in classic. literally IMPOSSBILE
[1:40:33] faet91: @aro725 H LK took like 100+ days to kill. Same with Algalon.
[1:40:33] spinnie: "before the race" when was that? there's been a race since tier 2.5 or something
[1:40:34] Spartany25: brainded take
[1:40:35] gronnlir: @Maximum I am a firm believer to have mythic be what it is for us normies and have either a Race level difficulty or even tournament realm where the raid is on the RWF level
[1:40:40] Pyropop13: yea thats the raid that made asmon quit raiding KEKW
[1:40:42] MeisterChiefX: its just more visible now because of streaming
[1:40:44] meozart: asmon wants bosses that he can go in with pugs and clear it day one @maximum   I think
[1:40:45] Elswango: it was mathematically impossible
[1:40:45] Lothland: Flex mythic
[1:40:45] fleks27: twin consort was so overtuned it needed a 20% nerf iirc before it was killable
[1:40:46] codydoubleu: @Maximum VANILLA HAD UNKILLABLE BOSSES ON RELEASE
[1:40:47] azoozi_ttv: 15!

[1:40:52] mrbaylis: It existed in Wrath the golden expansion for these guys.  Everyone just sucked back then
[1:40:52] Kemplore: Mythic raiding should have to play with all broken gear
[1:40:52] Razzin_: he thinks 20 is too low
[1:40:52] theweirdsquiggly: max this is just making you mad
[1:40:53] dom_1849: wtb 10 man again
[1:40:54] shiryun: 20 players is bad, lockout is bad and it being 800+ pulls is fking awfully bad
[1:40:54] nerefwow: PepeLaugh
[1:40:55] Jarlan23: you think 20 is too many? wait till he says he wants 40 man raiding back
[1:40:56] biglonelytv: HAH YOU KILLED WOW
[1:40:56] OptimalNormal0: the only reason I am interested in wow is the rwf
[1:40:56] ysilentswordy: this is surely ragebait, he has to know what he's doing at this point
[1:40:57] timmayb166: 40!
[1:40:58] Xann_: wait till you get to the part where he says he wants 40 man raids
[1:40:58] neohartrix: @Maximum Blizz should make a RWF realm and give open registrations for guild leaders to sign up for it. Fill the realm with enough gold for all the guilds to withdraw. NO funneling gear. Once each guild kills the last boss, transfer the progress to live realm where the guild raids.  Give special achievements, mounts/pets/sellable AH goodies with which guilds can make some bank on.   Its on blizzard to fix it.
[1:40:58] CloudyHS: @fleks27 cthun was also impossible
[1:40:59] maddi_: asmon hasn't enjoyed wow since wrath and it has nothing to do with the game, it has to do with how the internet impacted gaming and we can't get it back. this was obvious when asmon didn't enjoy wow classic very much. he didn't get the same game back
[1:41:01] MajorFrog225: oh yikes if you don't like 20 you're not gonna like his next take
[1:41:01] jin_spear: hes just a old dude out of touch

[1:41:32] sandpigeon: ????
[1:41:33] shunsha: I think mythic lockouts should have a choice. you can do 10, 15, or 20. 20 gives more loot, obviously. But 10 is a good number for some. 15 for others. 20 for others. maybe 25? but if 20 is too much then… yeah.

[1:41:36] Ruinx81: Don’t forget Asmon just sometimes rants for sensationalism and clickbate

[1:41:56] hxzcc: CAUGHT madcat
[1:41:57] cornsbakedgoods: Terrible add time barbGabnon
[1:41:58] struggs91: someone needs to tell asmon that your opinion on a game that you havent played in 6 years is less than irrelevant
[1:41:59] Ravical75: ads ahhhhhhhhh
[1:42:00] Wikedlyrics: can't believe they nerfed uncapped AOE cause of WF raiding
[1:42:00] spivet: @Tedrie people outside of the RWF aren't professionals lol, he said what he said
[1:42:01] Razzin_: they thouht its boring because they dont play the game to know its fun to AOE
[1:42:02] Cjpriest: thats lowkey stupid
[1:42:02] CloudyHS: it’s crazy how clueless asmon is yet he acts like he’s spitting truth
[1:42:03] luigikrosss: Adge
[1:42:03] bosseljon: AD ALERT
[1:42:06] smoothlol: SOD ANDYY
[1:42:06] mantooth11: LOL, M+ already is what he's looking for. Gear for easy content, challenge for those that want it.
[1:42:07] Larshouma: All people focusing on Asmons when it's a 9/9 Mythic Raider that actually wrote the post
[1:42:10] huntermaster_95: The classes that were capped were trash always compared to ones that were uncapped
[1:42:13] shiryun: @bosseljon adblock
[1:42:18] ZeroDMGDealt: fuqin ads
[1:42:19] ErikJugend: He's gotta do this just to farm engagement at this point, he doesn't even play the game
[1:42:21] DasAutoChat: They forgott to make the lower target counts classes to be best in those FeelsBadMan
[1:42:25] Moaklerqt: destro warlock great at 2 targets
[1:42:26] Syghtless: it is so frustrating to watch someone so uneducated with his size of audience spew boogieman propaganda
[1:42:26] Ionized4: uncap outlaw
[1:42:28] GooseComics: Twitch Turbo fellas
[1:42:29] BipolarPongal: @bosseljon Faker Penta kill Pog
[1:42:30] TyforKarma: It's like putting training wheels on 80% specs it was a terrible change
[1:42:31] holee105: warriors aren't even good at 5
[1:42:33] tobbs94: if they cant nerf a rtwf dif lvl boss after the race is done perfectly for other guilds, then they shouldnt tune bosses for the race, but if they can i think tuning the bosses for the race is better, brings more hype to the game during those weeks. Its that simple imo.
[1:42:36] codydoubleu: TrollDespair warriors are the worst at the thing they're supposed to be best at
[1:42:36] db____________: so making specs choose between aoe or st now is better or what? KEKW
[1:42:41] R0NGG: get turbo noobs
[1:42:42] faythes68: enh is the best example, everyone beats them at full aoe and single target
[1:42:42] gyser13: The point is he is making that mythic raiding should be for more people over time.
[1:42:43] ICitizenErasedI: it's a problem that happens to any game that goes on for so long - skill diff between the worst and best players is only going to increase. pretending that there's some "easy" fix is the ultimate lazy take
[1:42:44] Lyonidus: @Larshouma but asmon is the one who said RWF ruined wow
[1:42:48] Robohobbo: Except that you had classes like Arcane Mage who specialize at 5 target cap getting beaten by Destro lock in S3 on 5 target.
[1:42:50] foxsunalpha: It should be competitive. All games are made to be competitive. Hell even Solitaire is a competitive game lol.
[1:42:51] Kryous: They not only failed at this, but also didn't uncap. That's a double fail.
[1:42:52] Richton867: Can you please repeat everything you just said. Ads.
[1:42:52] Zeeky77: MM hunter
[1:42:53] CptPinkeye: Didn't asmons company sponsor a team specifically for RWF?
[1:42:53] Peber555: Enhance is almost there
[1:42:54] Robohobbo: So tuning wasn't always there
[1:42:55] GenXGamerDad: I want the pros because I enjoy watching them play at a high level....but I progress Normal and dabble in Heroic....game seems fine to me
[1:42:57] PvtCheese: @Syghtless to be fair though, he doesnt play wow and most of his viewers dont, they just like hating on something to make them feel cool
[1:43:00] elvia_: ttv lol pro

[1:43:06] Boreall: Asmongold ruined WoW
[1:43:08] Vis4vengeance: Again everyone in the game needs to be able to clear the hardest content???
[1:43:08] baddecisiondanx: @ICitizenErasedI true
[1:43:14] spivet: I am not an asmon watcher and if you told me this was him being a parody of himself on purpose I would believe it. the cooks are nuts lol
[1:43:15] rios1k: @Larshouma kekw
[1:43:17] paraqxtv: all uncapped aoe tho
[1:43:17] bloodsnaill: 500+ mob pull mara
[1:43:21] zerossussy: all uncapped

[1:43:25] Lenzoface: WL is uncapped

[1:43:28] Therealbrokensword: @Vis4vengeance thats the kicker, everyone can
[1:43:32] legitunplayable: please never say priests are OP again
[1:43:34] Doimos89: Ruined Raiding CAUGHT, Ruined Mythic + CAUGHT, Ruined PVP CAUGHT, ruined mount collecting CAUGHT, Ruined Economy CAUGHT, Ruined DNA CAUGHT, Ruined everything CAUGHT
[1:43:38] Ivaed: @Boreall 🍭
[1:43:39] sorliee: CAUGHT
[1:43:47] Vis4vengeance: I'm just saying like all skill levels?
[1:43:49] rustandsawdust: OP only in high M+, in raid they're MEH
[1:43:50] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum also target caps were a thing in classic
[1:43:51] cloudb0ys: asmongold doesn't have enough top end experience to be making the judgement calls he does. He just gets carried through both PvE & PvP for relevant/wanted achievements.
[1:43:51] alarkin: @Vis4vengeance I think every single player willing to spend 6 or 8 or 9 hours a week in that content should have a reasonable shot of clearing it, yes.
[1:43:53] Cakerinotv: i think they did a good job with outlaw
[1:43:55] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[1:43:57] gyser13: Perhaps the challenge should reset every expansion is his solution
[1:43:57] Kryous: Priest is hilarious, the numbers are tuned really high AND they are effective target capped BUT they CHOOSE the targets. That's what makes it so insane.
[1:43:58] foxsunalpha: what
[1:44:00] BigCizzle: HUH
[1:44:03] Atreayu: ???
[1:44:04] NotD4k: what did he just say
[1:44:04] zenkodac: cus people want to be the best
[1:44:10] Jelzo__: did I hear that last sentence right
[1:44:14] Vis4vengeance: I can't clear the hard marios mods for snes emulator
[1:44:17] zerossussy: newer dungeons are super hard
[1:44:19] luixun: im in to remove azmon from each mmo
[1:44:21] TyforKarma: @Lenzoface Yea, and all the mobs in the entire dungeon are dead before you ramp your damage after they added Malefic rapture
[1:44:21] Camelbak21: Some people never get better
[1:44:22] Therealbrokensword: for sure this applies to mplus 100%, having a dispel and 3 stops on EVERY pull is wild
[1:44:22] foxsunalpha: People people MMO because of the competitivness.
[1:44:23] fleks27: dont say complexity mate
[1:44:26] OldFlorrysGhost: too many abilities in dungeon packs
[1:44:27] NotD4k: an MMO not being competitive is prob a dead game
[1:44:27] Aliric23: he is right though
[1:44:29] Slapsstick: competition is necessary for any game, that last sentence is wild
[1:44:32] zenkodac: dude did you not watch pokemon when you were a kid its always the same "to be the very best"
[1:44:33] Line_0: The amount of actions from mobs in dungeons is soo many
[1:44:36] nathkin: if asmon had his way with what he is saying in this video everyone would either quit entirely or within weeks
[1:44:37] Ivaed: i agree with him. why is there a competitive focus in an MMO. The game should be made for everyone, not for just a few people
[1:44:39] gyser13: M+ is better when it is easier
[1:44:41] Spartany25: it's not just at the top though, players got better accross the board
[1:44:41] BobAwesome: And it fucking sucks, specially as casters who don't have instant procs. Constantly having to dance around swirlies and shit
[1:44:41] spivet: I really think anyone who makes a game that isn't for me specifically should stop, and instead make games that only I enjoy. If they make a game for someone other than me they are incorrect

[1:46:46] Solusbringer: What's worse about this take is HE treats the game like that. He literally holds mount competitions, He flexes his kills over old hard bosses and his logs. He was doing this as recently as last year. I know he has issues with the game but this take is bad
[1:46:50] alarkin: Didn't you say yesterday that almost all of your raiders stop playing wow after the race and until the next one? You can love the game and still it like a seasonal game, but it makes no sense that liquid gets to do that and 2500 guilds don't because the last two bosses were designed for them and not those 1000s of others right?

[1:48:37] Sothis_best_girl: Asmon with his typical shit takes
[1:48:38] avarraw: why do people listen to the boomer yelling at the sky
[1:48:39] SkrrtRussel: yeah so people being better is bad?
[1:48:40] Maelnstorm: All the "competitive problems" he is speaking of got into Classic pretty quickly too. It's the players who create these "problems".

[1:48:53] Deathkiller93: @Maximum no wait, atm pvp is garbage, its totally messed up
[1:48:54] Vis4vengeance: Again normal player needs to be the best at everything.....
[1:48:54] mega_togekiss: Good
[1:48:55] CloudyHS: NOT TRUE
[1:48:55] Destrolisher: classic
[1:48:55] guynormally: that's false now
[1:48:55] Syghtless: world pvp was never fun @Maximum
[1:48:56] codydoubleu: @Maximum also coming from the guy who will only take the top item level applicants when a raid launches so he can get funneled all gear
[1:48:57] bladenkurama: it is exceptionally fun, it’s not balanced
[1:48:57] OldFlorrysGhost: dead because of warmode
[1:48:58] Welsy_: World pvp is dead in most games
[1:48:58] brian_777777777: Asmon is a politician he just wants money
[1:48:58] klamonte: world pvp has been dead since vanilla wow
[1:48:58] Jazzarus_: BG Blitz is awesome, it will pop off with rating
[1:48:59] Lyonidus: world pvp has always been dogshit
[1:48:59] spivet: is his argument that people should be bad at PVP on purpose?
[1:48:59] chaos_terrain: wpvp has always been bad

[1:49:00] ifuse: tru Sadge
[1:49:00] BigCizzle: ICANT who cares

[1:49:01] buckfastjon: this guy just wants to play flash games and goon over waifus
[1:49:01] gyser13: the entire skill ceiling should be lowered on every aspect of WoW if it means the season is over faster so be it
[1:49:01] Sch1ey: @maximum you cant solo que rated bgs is why
[1:49:01] Squats3: @Maximum The irony cannot be lost on you that asmon seems to really dislike the effects of competitive raiding, but he sponsors a whole ass team.
[1:49:02] Lothland: World PvP has been dead since BG's existed. Because there is NO point to it lol
[1:49:03] grobb12: that was a huge part of wow tbf
[1:49:03] Elseworldz: wpvp is ass, good it's dead.
[1:49:04] aithran: world pvp is a trash design
[1:49:04] Floydhawk_: asmongold is just a professional yapper at this point and because of his fans and following it enables him, thats all there is to it
[1:49:04] BipolarPongal: warmode
[1:49:05] zerossussy: his pvp is absolutely true tbh
[1:49:05] racks22: world PVP is aids though
[1:49:05] faythes68: maybe because overall ppl dont want to get ganked
[1:49:06] Jorityxd: wpvp was dead in classic also so what ?
[1:49:06] foxsunalpha: Open World PvP would be cool
[1:49:06] MuggyMugus: @Maximum is this on Asmongold or zackarrr channel??? this seems like an Asmongold channel troll take
[1:49:07] Zorto5: when the game was boring and nothing to do ya
[1:49:08] FortuneNA: tbf world pvp is kinda toxic and bg players are mentally ill
[1:49:09] hotmanpop: when there was no flying mount
[1:49:09] dreadlobster: I think he just wants to back to when he was happy
[1:49:09] bigoldmeatpie: world pvp has been dead since BGs were introduced in vanilla
[1:49:09] MrDrexand: world pvp has always been annoying
[1:49:10] Therealbrokensword: eh its still very valid during leveling
[1:49:10] waelrick: go do world quests in the cave, it’s not dead
[1:49:10] Tabun_Time: it was something to do not fun
[1:49:10] DeathlyRaiser: I can't believe Max killed world PvP
[1:49:11] grimzero617: Isn't world pvp competitive? Wtf is his point?
[1:49:11] lolwhateverdog: world PVP is dead on PVP classic servers LMAO
[1:49:12] bladenkurama: I deserve points if I win 5/6
[1:49:13] Relyst: first week of the season it was nuts
[1:49:16] mikkymisuko: world pvp is manufactured nonsense
[1:49:16] Paybacks: yeah its just not that interesting by comparison anymore
[1:49:17] foxsunalpha: EQ?
[1:49:18] warpless: nothing more fair and casual friendly than world pvp
[1:49:19] puddypounce: FeelsStrongMan ganking people on timeless isle
[1:49:19] Tidurion: Thank God that world PvP is dead
[1:49:20] luixun: rgb is active xD
[1:49:20] Boreall: World PvP has ALWAYS been the absolute worst content. It's NEVER been balanced ever it's just "lol 100 people beating up 20", very very rarely was it like 100 v 100
[1:49:21] R0NGG: there actually is world pvp tho he just hasnt played KEKW
[1:49:22] yeyanow: World pvp is a gimmick and it lost its shine.
[1:49:22] ThisIsAsabel: asmon got rank 1 parsed, got every BIS he could, got glad titles, and now that he changed his mind he's shitting on it KEKW
[1:49:23] zerossussy: pvp has a high barrier of entry
[1:49:23] BigTrout3: kinda true cause alliance still gets a 30% but compared to hordes 10
[1:49:25] Firagano: WPVP was great when the game was fucking boring and there was nothing else to do
[1:49:25] Goltez: world pvp just = how to grief = winning
[1:49:26] huntermaster_95: Classic showed world PvP is trash
[1:49:27] Kryous: Didn't Venruki explain that PVP is actually thriving in Season 3 on the PoddyC? HUH
[1:49:27] Pwinzor: world pvp was only good in phase 2 classic LUL
[1:49:27] kheim: Correct, reason world pvp used to be good was cause nothing else was fun
[1:49:28] Slapsstick: world pvp is sick at the beginning of expansions while leveling
[1:49:29] cornsbakedgoods: Has wm off and complains about world pvp
[1:49:29] infraxtion: world type pvp is dead in mmos in general. They never stay populated.
[1:49:30] Jarlan23: WoW is a lobby game now thats why world pvp is dead
[1:49:31] dullermanjaro: still is
[1:49:33] renarton: the only true pvp is me spawn camping some 12 year old on their level 20 warrior
[1:49:33] BipolarPongal: These professionals, man ICANT
[1:49:34] Cheveyooo: @Maximum you just don't get it. PVP and raids shouldn't be competitive, because if you think about all the pieces on the chess board... so like the pawn is like a pistol. And the queen is like a bazooka. So logically it follows that you can't have that be in a competitive setting and still function.
[1:49:34] juvell2: world pvp was always ded
[1:49:36] Aro725: Go to the tier maker thing with warmode on and tell me world PVP is dead lmao. you will get farmed trying to make tier
[1:49:36] looya: cap
[1:49:36] JoaEUW: Mate world pvp is actually really cool if you're doing the wpvp quests OR if you randomly run into a chad in the wild with war mode on. BRO ASMON HAD NOT HAD WARMODE ON AND LOOKED FOR WPVP IN YEARS HOW CAN HE HAVE A FUCKING TAKE IM MAD j
[1:49:37] jin_spear: for pvp theres wayyyyyy better options
[1:49:38] Cjpriest: @grimzero617 if you think WPVP is competitive you are cracked
[1:49:39] bladenkurama: remove MMR and balance Druid with DH EX
[1:49:43] The_Frix: runescape would like to have a word
[1:49:43] looya: runescape > wow
[1:49:44] TyforKarma: WoW world PvP is like playing a literall powerpoint presentation anyways
[1:49:45] spivet: world PVP was good for two weeks in 2004 and no one has actually had fun with it since then
[1:49:49] Therealbrokensword: how do you feel about single handedly destroying world PVP?
[1:49:50] manlyhandles: petbattlers
[1:49:52] Sulm: world pvp was kinda fun in BFA. Died again for shadowlands and beyond though.
[1:49:53] Firagano: @ThisIsAsabel lets be honest, he was rank 1 parsed on the easiest class in the game.
[1:49:53] tagundnacht: This is how he copes with not being good at the game anymore I think
[1:49:54] 發記: cuz the flying mounts makes pvp dead
[1:49:55] weezie_61: What if.. World pvp means you could loot one piece of gear of someone you kill. That would be legit!
[1:49:55] Clindo_: @looya  Chatting
[1:50:00] Lilurrn: remove groups for world pvp and it would be better
[1:50:02] Quaking_Nut: low key farming for ratstallion was really fun which is kinda world pvp but not really
[1:50:02] R0NGG: there is gear for world pvp so pvpers do it.. there are zones/world quests
[1:50:04] menzlo: There was counter strike
[1:50:05] Jarlan23: everyone just goes into queue and hangs out in valdrakken. no one does wpvp unless theres a quest
[1:50:05] ICitizenErasedI: yeah it certainly wasnt the best pvp game in the world from australia with 300+ ping... :p
[1:50:09] yeyanow: Liquid killed pet battles Kappa
[1:50:10] Slapsstick: @JoaEUW just like the rest of the takes so far LUL
[1:50:12] Moaklerqt: yeah hes been mad about this since burning crusade
[1:50:20] foxsunalpha: PvP will make a PvE a better player. PvP is needed.
[1:50:21] Elseworldz: @weezie_61 And basically NOBODY would do it. Because F that noise.
[1:50:22] meozart: if asmon hates rwf so much why does he sponsor it? @maximum
[1:50:26] Cobelarus: WPVP Deadge
[1:50:28] Lothland: World PvP has been dead for 18 years
[1:50:29] filos0phia: and that's holding wow back
[1:50:30] vanicax: sod
[1:50:31] 發記: pvp player grouping is sick
[1:50:31] jimzyz98ttv: Liquid you guys kille mount farming Kappa

[1:50:35] GenXGamerDad: did it die with the removal of PVP servers?
[1:50:36] hotmanpop: PvP is for real mmo players
[1:50:37] BipolarPongal: @dorki CAUGHT
[1:50:40] imsorrykk: world pvp is dead even in SOD
[1:50:41] bladenkurama: still liked this game a lot but I can’t pay monthly
[1:50:42] Camelbak21: true
[1:50:42] StarShopping95: BRO CLASSIC PLAYERS CHECK YOUR LOGS TO DO GNOMER OMEGALUL
[1:50:42] biglonelytv: W
[1:50:44] zenkodac: thats 100% whats mainly changed about wow, people used to use it as a one stop shop for everything
[1:50:44] Onyo1337: not wrong
[1:50:46] sabaron: "world pvp" doesnt exist anywhere, its just ganking
[1:50:48] Zarroe: @Maximum can u pause the vid one more time just for the memes
[1:50:51] baddecisiondanx: if wpvp is dead then get rid of warmode
[1:50:52] TyforKarma: He's right about that
[1:50:53] Line_0: Good take Pog
[1:50:54] mavrikbtw: @yeyanow True tragedy. lol
[1:50:54] Destrolisher: KEKW
[1:50:55] talkley: HAH PROFESSIONAL 󠀀
[1:50:55] zerossussy: @Lothland wpvp was alive in mop and wod and it was great, legion not very much
[1:50:55] Slapsstick: thats fake outside of the 18-22 range LUL
[1:50:55] biglonelytv: YEP
[1:50:56] DranixOverlord: HAH
[1:50:56] hotmanpop: @StarShopping95 OMEGALUL
[1:50:56] spinnie: world pvp was big in vanilla before bg's where in and you got honor from it, iirc
[1:50:59] aithran: HAH
[1:50:59] BipolarPongal: It's the professionals HAH
[1:51:00] filos0phia: PvP is holding WoW back from truly specializing in the PVE it does so much better than many other games
[1:51:01] MeisterChiefX: RWF killed world pvp
[1:51:01] RoloDB: when was the last time asmon experienced the time lost from key depletion. LOL
[1:51:01] MrBosch: lmao
[1:51:02] GrimFandango: kalamaziTrue
[1:51:02] vtech310: this game has been out for 20 years a lot of players just have played for to long and that content is not interesting anymore
[1:51:02] wackpoetic: Solo Shuffle is great. Blizzard needs to push forward the release of Rated BG Blitz to next patch instead of War Within. BG's are the classic MMORPG PvP experience over arena
[1:51:02] Vis4vengeance: No complexity should be in any game obvi
[1:51:03] hxzcc: CAUGHT madcat  󠀀
[1:51:06] spivet: it all started when you got picked up by complexity and they said "now make people be mad if they depelte"
[1:51:07] renarton: world first raiders blew up the USS Maine
[1:51:09] kaydenqt: thanks for ruining pvp max

[1:51:16] codydoubleu: ICANT paint
[1:51:18] BipolarPongal: BOOBA
[1:51:19] frozenheartsqt: Time for your Gnomer Parse Meeting... better not fuck up your level 40 twink
[1:51:20] leubinator: thats cultural apropriation of paint
[1:51:21] BloodSick_PT: so an anus
[1:51:23] Cheveyooo: @Maximum you just don't get it. PVP and raids shouldn't be competitive, because if you think about all the pieces on the chess board... so like the pawn is like a pistol. And the queen is like a bazooka. So logically it follows that you can't have that be in a competitive setting and still function. And world first players are to blame
[1:51:25] parrti_: PoddyC content episode????
[1:51:25] Arcinatos: max parses better on paint

[1:51:29] ShabsieAU: wtf does pvp have to do with mythic raiding???
[1:51:29] foxsunalpha: I think not
[1:51:29] TheSabin: LetHimJoel
[1:51:29] PexaU: no shot that many people PVP LMAO
[1:51:30] enigmasvea: not this again KEKW
[1:51:30] BigTrout3: it's the eye of sauron
[1:51:31] jamiboiy: it says 0 to me
[1:51:31] huntermaster_95: Competitive PvP = Arena
[1:51:31] Cobelarus: BOOBA
[1:51:31] kheim: "Not to scale"
[1:51:32] Rafix1301: not that many people do pvp in general
[1:51:33] DranixOverlord: @Maximum Why did you ruin pvp Max?
[1:51:33] Razdruid: I mean if you compare it to pve yeah but its not compared to PVE
[1:51:34] sgtshellshocka: cant even do a fucking circle graph right
[1:51:36] yeyanow: I think the player base got older and when your older you have less time, and when you have less time you tend to fk around less
[1:51:37] Slapsstick: its just magnified by 100x
[1:51:39] athcoids: I agree... pvp is an anus
[1:51:40] ItchY_val: I assume its arbitrary
[1:51:40] biglonelytv: it looks like a 0
[1:51:41] huntercreeper54: ohh no he don't understand circles
[1:51:41] BipolarPongal: BOOBA that is quite large

[1:51:48] sarrowzthewarlock: BOOBBA
[1:51:49] Lothland: @zerossussy it was only alive in the rewards that were given for a short time, not really alive. It was "alive" in Legion because of world quests. If there isn't a reason to world pvp no one does it. Nothing killed it, it's just NEVER done when there isn't a reward for doing it
[1:51:49] fdb33: bro such tight butthole
[1:51:50] foxsunalpha: I dont PvP much and when I do. I dom in PvP lol

[1:52:36] thegrt13: a jawbreaker
[1:52:36] ThisIsAsabel: dude, it's just what ppl like the most
[1:52:37] BipolarPongal: doesn't he get carried in Arena anyway
[1:52:37] Namutski: its how you gear from PvP?
[1:52:38] traisc: yes
[1:52:38] GooseComics: Because Blizzard has MAINLY focused on Arena only.
[1:52:38] Clush___: @Maximum because arena is the only thing with rewards
[1:52:39] fistphul: Martini
[1:52:40] stuffiexo: does he even know what's saying?
[1:52:41] Dicath: there's no rbg tournaments

[1:52:44] texazbandit: because bg’s suck ass
[1:52:44] grieze: yes 100%
[1:52:45] Sefirosuwar: awc <---its the event they show.
[1:52:45] Aro725: Tuning for Arena, sometime makes other pvp worse
[1:52:45] DonDabon: kinda yes, with gear
[1:52:45] Nightmareo: it does cause Awards
[1:52:45] AceofRaphy: Yes glad mount
[1:52:46] Slapsstick: arena is most fun so people going there is all a conspiracy
[1:52:47] Zarroe: solo shuffle is a meme
[1:52:47] Sch1ey: No solo rated bgs makes rated bgs impossible @maximum
[1:52:48] FluffyBorkenz: that's what you get weekly vault for
[1:52:48] yeyanow: I never played arena, and still play pretty well
[1:52:49] GooseComics: When was the llast time they made a new Battleground?
[1:52:49] trevor_sub: they ligit ever did anything for BGS
[1:52:50] KitkatsTV: arena is the only esport that wow broadcasts
[1:52:52] Superhank: HUH
[1:52:52] sabaron: ?????
[1:52:53] iPsyop: they incentivize arena more for sure
[1:52:53] Cjpriest: 100% true
[1:52:54] Cxistian: yep
[1:52:55] spivet: HUH
[1:52:55] foxsunalpha: BGS see more pople in game
[1:52:55] cloudb0ys: the only PvP asmon has done in recent years is fighting the cockroaches built up in his bedroom
[1:52:55] belfastcl: true
[1:52:55] Kalanil: i mean, gear and mounts
[1:52:56] zenkodac: its because its seens as the more competitive mode
[1:52:56] nokster: thatx completely false with pvp
[1:52:56] AzzaHub: Asmongold just said on his stream that you should make your own content instead of getting views with his vids
[1:52:57] mestarvirus: @Maximum is there mdi for rated battlegrounds that i missed ? hmmmm
[1:52:57] biglonelytv: true
[1:52:57] PvtCheese: Arent balance changes good for everyone?
[1:52:58] prestonrayne: pvp ruins every game
[1:52:58] mxgxbx: @BipolarPongal all content hes done since wod
[1:52:59] KitkatsTV: for pvp
[1:52:59] coolhotjackedguy: nah he is right, BGs dont give shit for rewardes and theyve only ever advertised the AWC
[1:52:59] NotD4k: btw boomy got a talent fucked cuz of pvp RAGEY
[1:52:59] kheim: terrible take
[1:52:59] uncred95: what changes?
[1:53:00] Superhank: no one plays rbg
[1:53:01] fdb33: Bro Mobas do that and people seem to like them
[1:53:02] Floydhawk_: shit asmongold makes up just cos dash number 7
[1:53:02] minatozakixQ: TRUE
[1:53:04] thebasednerd: They balance PVP and PVE separately tho?
[1:53:04] Darkevietv: Arena has a Tournament. RBG doesn't so in that sense Arena is it For PVP
[1:53:05] wackpoetic: he's saying that Blizzard focuses on Arena for competitive PvP and is ignoring other brackets. TBF they are adding Rated BG Blitz, so this is kind of a moot point
[1:53:05] huntermaster_95: Balance changes for unskilled is never good
[1:53:06] targus92dd: yes, they have. no new bgs in years.
[1:53:09] Superhank: but they are the majority?
[1:53:11] itsw0rthit: he literally hosts OTK dueling tournaments lol
[1:53:12] wonkus1: does the balance matter for the big circle?
[1:53:12] Razdruid: they do that in PVE too tho.
[1:53:15] verii: nah pvp changes really only effect arena though
[1:53:15] Cyrant: @cloudb0ys LUL
[1:53:16] lingling102: my limited understanding is, that pvp is balanced around arena
[1:53:16] RenegadeHeals: the "majority" he wants to represent doesnt need any sort of balance
[1:53:19] Clox9: @fdb33 but moba arent a mmorpg
[1:53:19] Xann_: I disagree completely,  if I had to guess there are more people that play arenas than any other form of PvP.
[1:53:20] bladenkurama: I dominated as a noob because of DH
[1:53:20] zugsmcghee: this idiot just wants to collect transmog in runs that take 2 sec or get carried in the harder content lmfao he's so stupid
[1:53:25] lockishy: Let him finish and then we will see what he has to say hahah
[1:53:25] phiAnthony91: but its the minority of the players that find the advantages that need to be balanced
[1:53:26] yeyanow: They tried different things and they failed, like pvp specific builds and roles
[1:53:27] foxsunalpha: yes
[1:53:28] zenkodac: makes no sense they are making content for people in that play the game
[1:53:30] comFox: hes just making up numbers to fit his narrative
[1:53:31] ViiDak: pvp and balance changes LOL. DH has been OP for like 2 months
[1:53:32] TyforKarma: Let him finnish paint presentation HAH
[1:53:33] Floydhawk_: should be in blue then not red wot
[1:53:37] Boreall: Trying to make sense of nonsense
[1:53:40] Kawjiryu: idk what he would expect them to tune pvp for
[1:53:41] lmaoerss: Doubt they do rbg tunins
[1:53:41] Razdruid: yeah RBGs are ignored like M+
[1:53:42] ThisIsAsabel: Arena is like THE thing Pvp players like to do
[1:53:43] Jorityxd: they are also the only ones that care about these changes
[1:53:43] nayrcraig: Also, the only people how care about balance are the competative players
[1:53:44] GooseComics: Yeah. PVP focus changes is mostly from Arena.
[1:53:44] BipolarPongal: @mxgxbx lol I remember him getting carried by this healer, Metaphors or something. Feels like he's stuck in the past
[1:53:45] Genesisis: 3v3 is the minority when compared to wpvp, bgs,rated bgs, and all form of pvp
[1:53:47] verii: turning doesnt really effect rbgs because of the number of classes in an RBG
[1:53:47] HarmlessCurse: rbg's are just sorta yolo
[1:53:48] Floydhawk_: im losing brain cells i gotta turn off
[1:53:48] dawnovun: RBG's is 100% exploiters and boosters, some of the top players are like 200wins 1 loss
[1:53:49] q48live: he thinks its still TBC and ppl like to play BGs still
[1:53:49] fdb33: @Clox9 its a game played by a bunch of people I think the argument hes tryna make applies in the same way
[1:53:50] Omekoba: He can't get glad mounts so he's mad
[1:53:50] Glowerss: They do 0 balancing for RBGs.
[1:53:52] kheim: The "majority" hes talking about has no need for balancing? I dont get his point at all
[1:53:56] nayrcraig: Casuals just wanna game, who cares if it's balanced
[1:53:57] spivet: it would be extremely funny if they tuned PVP on the worst players in the game on purpose
[1:53:59] vanicax: ppl play more regular bgs then arena
[1:53:59] Cjpriest: except for the pve changes it effects pvp as well
[1:54:03] belfastcl: there are more casual pvpers than arena players, but everything on pvp is designed around gearing up for arena
[1:54:04] Spartany25: Someone asmon a take out menu....his food extra crispy burnt
[1:54:04] hullkki: how does this affect negatively casual pvp enjoyers?
[1:54:04] mantooth11: there's 0 tuning for rbgs or arena
[1:54:05] Avarizz: i dont understand at all, so we dont want balance patches?
[1:54:09] lingling102: the argument is "balancing happens around arena" -> world pvp/bg/rbg become sucky and therefore ppl gravitate to arena
[1:54:11] KitkatsTV: they only really care about arena tuning because that's the only esport that they have for pvp. they don't have an esport for rbgs or any other pvp modes.
[1:54:12] bladenkurama: faster queues too
[1:54:17] belvedee: As a pvper, they also need to change the meta to keep it fresh
[1:54:18] foxsunalpha: And that circle is way smaller.
[1:54:23] Namutski: @mantooth11 wrong
[1:54:25] Pwinzor: AWC gets 10k viewers, League WC 10mil viewers, no one cares about wow esports
[1:54:26] BipolarPongal: RBG as boomie Kreygasm
[1:54:29] KaisenSiru: RBGs Pog
[1:54:29] crucial1711: rbg's used to be the only pvp
[1:54:30] Isolol: It's a pain to get the people together for RBG
[1:54:31] huntercreeper54: rbg with friends is awesome
[1:54:31] BigTheTank: rbgs are the only pvp i enjoy
[1:54:32] Cobelarus: you like RBGs cause you're professional Kappa
[1:54:33] zenkodac: you know why no one does rbgs
[1:54:33] Razdruid: because of the coms
[1:54:34] zerossussy: competitive rbg is so much fun
[1:54:34] TheHallMonitor: player amount probably
[1:54:34] HumanityDH: people do what ever gives rewards. when RBGs gave gear pvp did rbgs
[1:54:35] PvtCheese: @kheim i think his point is that if you take something thats OP for a skilled player and nerf it to be balanced it then can become crap for a shit player, which is a bad point lol
[1:54:36] verii: pvp changes are naturally going to effect the modes with the least amount of people in the game at once...
[1:54:36] Old_Tomatoes: Have you tried to make an rbg group?
[1:54:37] Glowerss: RBG community is toxic as balls but the new battleground RSS is kinda lit
[1:54:38] Frollexi: too many slurs
[1:54:38] Raisenette: the players of RBGs killed it LUL
[1:54:38] DasAutoChat: they probarly get ddosed Keepo
[1:54:38] mantooth11: RBGs were amazing SL season 1, then everyone stopped playing them
[1:54:40] yeyanow: People do rbgs just at a very casual level
[1:54:41] Jazzarus_: it will happen with BG Blitz, they are awesome
[1:54:42] dreadlobster: they can be kind of a slog
[1:54:42] CloudyHS: ??
[1:54:42] The_Boctor: u cant broadcast the coms from RBGs
[1:54:42] Sovice: @mantooth11 That's only true for this ssn, every other season this expansion has had a lot of tuning, too much at times
[1:54:43] Cjpriest: because its not balanced. its the same 2 comps for the last like 15 years
[1:54:43] Diazanite: rbgs are fun it is just easier to get 2 other boys together than it is to get 9 other boys together
[1:54:43] noirlol: HUH ???
[1:54:44] Austrian: ok?
[1:54:45] DranixOverlord: ???????????
[1:54:46] spiritcheese: HUH
[1:54:46] backerxx: WOW is just an old, late stage game that everybody has nostalgia for how it used to be
[1:54:46] noirlol: ??????????
[1:54:46] spivet: HUH
[1:54:46] targus92dd: playing rbg is fun, forming a grp for rbg is not fun.
[1:54:46] CloudyHS: what?
[1:54:46] rbgdev: I only watch rbg streams
[1:54:47] Gritalian: People who like that content go to games purposely built around that content
[1:54:48] enigmasvea: huh
[1:54:48] jin_spear: rbgs has a lot of toxicity. 1 loss its disband. so logistics
[1:54:49] Boreall: Guy who doesn't PvP with a PvP take got it
[1:54:49] cookie2505: increased focus on arena from blizz pushes more people away from bgs. it’s a negative feedback loop
[1:54:49] noirlol: WHAT
[1:54:51] Jorityxd: ???
[1:54:51] zenkodac: its because of the people who play rbgs, and no one wants to play with them
[1:54:52] NotD4k: thats a personal take
[1:54:54] milostrif: I mean, arena has always been the most popular PVP for just soooo long
[1:54:54] DranixOverlord: ok dude
[1:54:55] GrimFandango: Just turn it off, this shit is embarraassing
[1:54:55] noirlol: ????????????????????????
[1:54:56] verii: yes
[1:54:56] uncred95: asmongold should suck a dick and shut up sometimes lol
[1:54:58] thenateo2: people like arena
[1:54:58] lmaoerss: thats such a bad take
[1:54:58] iPsyop: RBG's could be as big as league or Dota tbh if the BG's were more complex
[1:54:59] Themselves: @Pwinzor neither of those numbers are correct
[1:54:59] Zorto5: farming these takes
[1:54:59] JackOfAllApocalypses: it's just group size...more people play M+ than raid, more people arena than RBG
[1:54:59] Lothland: Wow was never designed for PvP in general. So it shouldn't exist at all right?
[1:55:00] frozenheartsqt: Didnt he say like a year ago that MMORPGs should stop catering to casuals who only play their game once a month and cater to the dedicated fanbase?? @Maximum
[1:55:00] jamiboiy: but players made arena the preference?
[1:55:00] ApolloRache: Arena are in the game since tbc
[1:55:01] aithran: people who designed the game, designed it wrong ICANT
[1:55:01] SirBlayks: L take
[1:55:01] yeyanow: But they aren't? The people watch arena
[1:55:02] Boreall: He's not actually saying anything
[1:55:03] ApolloRache: lmao
[1:55:03] spiritcheese: because he likes it more? HUH
[1:55:04] verii: arena players obviously disagree
[1:55:05] enigmasvea: ARENA IS WHAT MADE WOW PVP KEKW
[1:55:06] chaos_terrain: rare asmon W
[1:55:06] JWallace: yo as@on did a ton of arena
[1:55:07] Gutshots: It seems like MMO's are not meant for anything according to asmon
[1:55:07] Cobelarus: YEP olive
[1:55:07] BloodSick_PT: based on "old" wow
[1:55:07] klamonte: just cause you suck dick at arena asmon doesnt make arena bad lmao
[1:55:07] iWatchPeoplePlayStuff: Everything is subjective.
[1:55:07] ThisIsAsabel: clueless take
[1:55:09] TheCahoots: I don't understand this at all.
[1:55:09] Protips: It's not subjective, his chat spams "TRUE" so it's correct
[1:55:10] Slapsstick: remember he hosted a duel tournament, even tho he said pvp has always been bad
[1:55:10] spinnie: this is actually true, pvp was the afterthought when wow was literally 1.0
[1:55:12] trickyshot_: HAH pvpers
[1:55:14] Sanctos304: he's not saying anything. that's the problem
[1:55:16] yuhkz: just go next this is a huge L of a take
[1:55:16] Xanctius: PvP = Olives
[1:55:16] zenkodac: "wtf is a mmo even"
[1:55:17] Greencaps07: in the content of mmo
[1:55:18] jamiboiy: yep
[1:55:19] dreadlobster: didn’t arena make PvP more fun/popular ?
[1:55:20] enigmasvea: PPL PLAY WOW PVP BECAUSE OF ARENA HAH
[1:55:20] gshenks: nah,he's just been giving dogshit takes for years now
[1:55:20] Halt57: hes not cooking, hes cooked
[1:55:20] spiritcheese: YEP
[1:55:20] Cjpriest: @aithran because they did LOL
[1:55:20] renarton: ive seen him make the exact opposite take too lmao
[1:55:21] BigTrout3: WHAT THE FUCK IS AN ARENA LETSGO
[1:55:21] bigoldmeatpie: it sounds like he just wants more people so he can be carried
[1:55:21] Xarconos: @Maximum he likes big game modes so he can get carried
[1:55:24] GrimFandango: "If it wasn't in Vanilla, it's a bad system no matter what"
[1:55:25] vigilantknives: blizzard are the ones that made arena?
[1:55:25] Mattd3x: it’s based on his personal experience because he could never enjoy it due to losing
[1:55:26] Therapy2: mmo = many people
[1:55:26] bmarksy: because of rewards
[1:55:27] Jorityxd: its easier to get carried in rbg Kapp
[1:55:27] Razdruid: arena is way harder than RBGs. you can basically stack a bunch of rets and DH's and mop the floor with another team in RBGs
[1:55:27] Groinhammer: I like arenas more
[1:55:28] talkley: hes just sying words max
[1:55:29] Cakerinotv: Why is he trying to disregard the opinion of players who play the game a certain way?
[1:55:29] BipolarPongal: It's the professionals HAH
[1:55:29] jkJustice: didn't this last event pop the fuck off and it was only arena?
[1:55:29] bigsockets: rbgs are toxic and full of cheaters
[1:55:30] darkgigaz: Easier to balance with a team of 10 vs 3?
[1:55:31] HeiroGaming: 45 minute Alterac Valley RBG's are captivating . . . said noone ever
[1:55:32] traisc: the problem is there are no rewards from doing BGs anymore @Maximum
[1:55:33] belfastcl: could it be that they put all the rewards behind arena gameplay when it came out?
[1:55:33] dreadlobster: I legit think he’s coming at this from a “when I was happy” angle
[1:55:34] malvy1: cause of rewards
[1:55:35] Arcth_: its because classic is about battleground and he like classic
[1:55:35] enigmasvea: asmon is hella burnt KEKW
[1:55:35] gzok__: his take is that competition is bad in mmos for some reason but then he said rbgs are good?
[1:55:35] Austrian: rbgs HAH
[1:55:35] targus92dd: nah, he is right here. clear focus on arena over rbg
[1:55:36] DranixOverlord: lmao KEKW
[1:55:36] volkiers: he love rbgs
[1:55:37] Zorto5: true
[1:55:37] vanicax: yeah the 1000 players
[1:55:39] Doomei_TV: Asmongold actually doesn't understand what the word "Designed" means
[1:55:39] Kawatteruwow: arena gives you better rewards
[1:55:40] osatox: because of the rewards tied to it
[1:55:41] volkiers: that is all
[1:55:42] Relyst: it was the only competitive option for years and became the standard
[1:55:44] Ardal_Obe: One reason: Barrier of entry is lower for Arena, you don't need 10-15 people
[1:55:44] sabaron: its so much easier to get a couple people for arena vs rbgs
[1:55:44] q48live: its the classic Team Deathmatch vs CTF. people just want to frag out
[1:55:44] jamiboiy: he's kinda projecting tbh
[1:55:45] TomaHawK_The_One: irs also because of gear @Maximum
[1:55:47] ICitizenErasedI: remember when it was 5s? crazy!
[1:55:47] Slapsstick: thats actually true LUL or it was in SL
[1:55:48] Razdruid: they are
[1:55:49] Cjpriest: becasue they are
[1:55:50] dutchgoesham: 2s 2400 is giga chad now tbh
[1:55:51] Avarizz: Arena is mega fun.. dunno why he is talking shit? - even himself was doing alot of arena
[1:55:52] potatobreadsoup: arenas are just boring
[1:55:55] ninah_wtf: Maybe its like the mmo aspect? Like its supposed to be massive? Not 2v2
[1:55:55] grimzero617: It's harder to get 10 people of comparable skill level together for pvp
[1:55:55] eyelashTV: RBGs are really fun to me
[1:55:57] chicbot2k: asmongold hates arenas cause theres not enough players to carry him
[1:55:57] Centriuzz: There's much more personal skill expression in arena, so that's where the personal challenge lies imo.
[1:55:57] sadalxx: Rewards it what made the community chose between RMGs and Arena
[1:55:58] BipolarPongal: Liquid and Echo ruining PvP too CAUGHT
[1:55:59] BigTrout3: that should be our new rwf rally, "what the fuck is an arena"
[1:56:00] Superhank: the focus on arena is because thats what 95% of the pvp players play
[1:56:01] milostrif: He just says that because he likes rbg, its not the first time he has this take
[1:56:03] darkgigaz: It's the opposite I would think
[1:56:03] NotD4k: CAUGHT boomies
[1:56:05] Diazanite: rbgs got some tuuuurbo racists in em tho LMFAO
[1:56:05] theBuktu: he wants 40v40 cuz roleplay or smth
[1:56:05] Cjpriest: there has never been a balanced season of RBGs
[1:56:06] MangoAndKiwi: yeah man deathmatch is so hard to understand like what?
[1:56:09] jamiboiy: his sheep will LUL
[1:56:09] skytouch1: I think bro should retire from opinion making
[1:56:14] Madcatmk02: DK's giga broken because you can single someone out. Rogues because you can sit a base ETC
[1:56:14] Lirnril: The common thread is that AoE ruins everything and they should never have added AoE abilities to the game
[1:56:15] Doenos: total strawman LuL
[1:56:16] dreadlobster: Arenas are just so much more accessible and feel more fair imo
[1:56:18] verii: no it wasnt
[1:56:19] Austrian: pvp is garabage cause he doesnt like arena i guess
[1:56:19] volkiers: never see a dk took une heal and be oneshot
[1:56:19] talkley: no it wasnt KEKW
[1:56:20] Cobelarus: 5v5 ICANT
[1:56:20] NotD4k: KEKW
[1:56:21] verii: it was a cluster fuck
[1:56:24] 1_blase: since BC KEKW
[1:56:24] Wikedlyrics: the more players the easier it is for him to get carried
[1:56:24] ThisIsAsabel: game is too complex nowadays for rbgs, we're not just auto attacking with a few blizzards anymore
[1:56:25] BipolarPongal: @NotD4k man, that's legit the most fun I had. Just starfall and dot, top damage xdd
[1:56:28] zenkodac: its just buzzwords to rile his chat up
[1:56:30] rottisxd: literally no one has said that since bc
[1:56:30] tobbs94: reading the one guy KEKW
[1:56:33] crucial1711: 5v5 was incredibly hard to balance, comps would just pick a person and global them through any kind of CD's
[1:56:34] nayrcraig: I've been sying this since BC, the last time I played WOW
[1:56:34] Tuulz_: Asmonogold, only enjoys content that lets him be the shit  carried player, and needs 9-29 people to carry him through anything he does.
[1:56:38] NooboniousPrime: this whole thing about what content makes the game good is irrelevant. It's not the content that makes the game good it's who you play with
[1:56:42] BigTrout3: holy brown nose chatter
[1:56:44] Artheeri: bro not realizing that BC and retail are two different games who happen to have the same name
[1:56:45] kheim: RBG meta has been the same for 6 expansions, terrible take. PvP NEEDS to be balanced from arenas, theres no other way around it
[1:56:46] traisc: PVPers are incentivized not to do BGs even though they are a fun game mode
[1:56:49] spivet: look if asmon doesn't like something then no one else can either
[1:56:53] enigmasvea: Asmon spews out anything to make his chat spam true KEKW
[1:56:54] fleks27: become?
[1:56:59] Madcatmk02: nope
[1:57:00] Sanctos304: he's part of the segment of the player base that doesn't like challenge but wants to feel powerful
[1:57:01] Slapsstick: i think he forgot what it said
[1:57:03] huntercreeper54: how does he read wtf
[1:57:09] belfastcl: @NooboniousPrime who is willing to play the game has everything to do with what kind of content the game offers
[1:57:12] yeyanow: This whole take is why isn't wow designed for only me
[1:57:14] Birdmang07: PvP rating stated with arena, we were kind of conditioned to gravitate towards it for top end PvP gear and BGs felt like they got put on the back burner.
[1:57:15] Xathias: 100
[1:57:21] SirPikajew: @huntercreeper54 In whichever way fits the narrative
[1:57:23] BipolarPongal: Liquid and Echo ruining PvP and PVE ICANT
[1:57:25] shortasianman6: why does it seem like asmongolds opinion are the product of incest
[1:57:26] avengeltv: avengeltv subscribed with Prime. 
[1:57:27] HoseiYamasaki: M+ is the issue, case closed
[1:57:29] zenkodac: its not blizz fault people fiend like mad people over gear
[1:57:30] shunsha: you guys get gear?
[1:57:32] Dwysterr: hot take — blizzard doesn't design raids to be cleared in the first 4 weeks
[1:57:32] hawk748: make loot rare and remove soulbound from the game
[1:57:32] menzlo: Get rid of gearing
[1:57:32] bazefacee: @fleks27 Pog
[1:57:33] Themselves: delete m+
[1:57:34] Im_Jom: these bosses die 15 ilvl less then everyone else compared to RWF lol
[1:57:34] bladenkurama: there is so much missed opportunity
[1:57:35] AtomJar: @traisc the problem with BG's is we have all done them 1000's of times, they need to add more maps
[1:57:36] ayokay4200: HAH ITS YOUR GUYS FAULT I KNEW IT HAH
[1:57:42] Aro725: So youre saying its your fault
[1:57:46] belfastcl: @Birdmang07 they turned bgs into a chore you do to gear up for arena
[1:57:46] lathander557: Asmon needs to understand that it's okay to let go and stop having his personal identity tied to a game he doesn't play
[1:57:47] BipolarPongal: These professionals HAH
[1:57:49] yeyanow: Max wants personal loot back keke
[1:57:52] Ruinx81: That’s just you though rest of us don’t do that
[1:57:52] Urdian: you guys are the testers
[1:57:52] Kakan_94: tournament realm with fixed ilvl, easy fix
[1:57:54] ayokay4200: "PROFESSIONAL GAMERS" HAH

[1:58:05] BLACKFOOT_TN: I don't agree with much Asmon is saying here. But the posters points are legit. Raiding has gone down a kinda shitty path.
[1:58:05] Bollash: Even without splits you can just spam m+
[1:58:10] Wunshi: should have account wide raid lockouts for like 3 weeks
[1:58:11] spiritcheese: EZ to ggod for the Game

[1:58:11] biglonelytv: HAH professional HAH professional HAH professional HAH professional HAH professional HAH professional HAH professional

[1:58:19] CloudyHS: HAH professional HAH professional
[1:58:20] menzlo: Normalize gear in instances
[1:58:21] Cxistian: why they tho

[1:58:24] avarraw: yo that was a great cook max
[1:58:26] BipolarPongal: xddShrug
[1:58:27] Xathias: The race would be fun to watch at that level.
[1:58:29] nellfin: @Wunshi no
[1:58:29] The9thChevron: Do you think WoW would benefit from a contest mode similar to Destiny 2?
[1:58:29] Sulm: The gear from M+ just cant be as farmable as it is now, especially at the ilvl it gives
[1:58:35] gwenmh: LOCK ILVLS FOR RFWF!!!
[1:58:35] alarkin: They shouldn't be tuned for you at all though - they shouldn't be tuned with you or echo in mind, period.

[1:58:50] Zorto5: this is great
[1:58:51] lmnop_mnb: elden ring OP
[1:58:51] jimhasnotekkers: the issue right now is that for the race to be fair they have to remove the randomness from drop chance right. The mechanisms that exist right now let you guys go to bosses with the same ilvl as any other serious team.
[1:58:52] luixun: HUH?
[1:58:53] freehawk1: AIIIEEEEE
[1:58:53] verii: @Maximum i would say they scale the raid to the average raid ilvl but then people would just have someone naked right
[1:58:54] zenkodac: is this a action RPG or a mmo?

[1:59:01] joshjarx: very rare asmon L

[2:06:31] Themselves: xdd
[2:06:31] Stephy_Mariee: whats so wrong with nerfs? why is he so mad lol
[2:06:31] zenkodac: cus everyone know every games release all its content super balanced
[2:06:31] acee_______: blizz balance is crap
[2:06:32] みょせつ: xddShrug
[2:06:35] yeyanow: Like elden ring has like 3-6 on development time. Do they want a new raid every 5 years?
[2:06:35] zenkodac: knows*
[2:06:38] brewdweard: actualy, RWF migth find fixes
[2:06:38] Hxwkins: nerfing them so more people can get a kill, but letting it be hard enough to be entertaining is just better for everyone
[2:06:41] ElderSeas: His opinion on wow is entirely irrelevant at this point. He hasnt raided or done anything in wow in expansions at this point
[2:06:42] Lowdahl: There's a reason why he only talks with his own chat and dont have arguements with anyone who he isnt friends with
[2:06:43] Razzin_: he came back excited before patch, even got carried to KSM and then he played new patch for 1 day
[2:06:44] BipolarPongal: xddShrug
[2:06:44] jilech: @cronvix sick burn
[2:06:45] sja4: y?
[2:06:45] waelrick: xddShrug why
[2:06:48] sabaron: games with rpg elements, bosses and classes have no been balanced, literally ever, why is this surprising to him
[2:06:48] Weslicus: 3 expansions isnt that long?
[2:06:50] luixun: before it was server frist per realm :D
[2:06:50] BigTrout3: xddShrug
[2:06:50] Darksynth: xddShrug b-b-but why am i bald
[2:06:50] yeahp0n: it existed but only to the fans.
[2:06:50] munasauna: asmon and contradictions, name a more iconic duo
[2:06:51] ill3stdrew: you've said it before, blizz devs have no way of balancing it becuase they them selves cant down mythic raid
[2:06:52] GandelionWhite: xddShrug
[2:06:53] porteus: xddShrug
[2:06:53] belfastcl: there always was a race to world first, it just wasn't like it is now, that's part of the point
[2:06:53] zenkodac: lies
[2:06:53] kattyls: xiv nerfs bosses because they only have devs test on godmode, so that seems like a weak ass comparison
[2:06:56] Maggaeri: then freaking don't play it again if you don't like it.   cripes how hard is it for him to grasp that concept, lol
[2:06:57] sabaron: never*
[2:06:57] grimzero617: It's like if he keeps talking he'll find a point
[2:06:57] chronohan: xddShrug Why?
[2:06:58] shibbies: "the race to world first is why wow is bad, also wow has always been like this"
[2:06:59] ComicsWoW: I'm sure a lot of things are crazy to this moron
[2:06:59] texazbandit: it’s always existed just not to the point it’s at now
[2:07:01] bladenkurama: battlegrounds looks like a 20 year old game
[2:07:01] sami_war: @Maximum how about you take RWF to a different test realm like MDI and give contesters a max Ilvl ?
[2:07:04] BLACKFOOT_TN: RWF has been around in community for years. Before Mega guilds came along.
[2:07:08] rozlotte: ff14 does nerfs with the echo, but you can disable it
[2:07:09] kheim: Isnt RWF just a community created thing?
[2:07:09] zerossussy: game is way better now
[2:07:10] belfastcl: was more popular
[2:07:11] survhunterdream: ffxiv had an hp nerf for a boss
[2:07:11] stumie: That's still true
[2:07:13] teatox: Asmon doesn't even play wow KEKW
[2:07:14] bayazijr: Power creep buff is actually not a bad idea
[2:07:14] Squats3: because the power creep buff from ICC wouldnt work now. damage isnt the issue most of the time
[2:07:15] vanicax: no one raids mythic look at the % of ppl who finish the raid and play compared to prev raids… gotten lower but think it’s cause of ppl don’t have the time
[2:07:16] stumie: ????????????
[2:07:17] codydoubleu: C'Thuun and Hakkar then?
[2:07:19] stumie: WHAT A TAKE
[2:07:19] Morayeden: That's actually true
[2:07:20] Faraday5001: ?????????????
[2:07:21] yeti_91: Idk man last two bosses were specifically the problem this tier and late nerfs killing communities that I had seen.
[2:07:21] Jjmn12: AINTNOWAY
[2:07:21] CloudyHS: @Maximum this notion that they cant make mistakes is fucking insane
[2:07:21] BabyDunn: i mean thats true though
[2:07:21] meozart: @maximum he wants a boss that he can pug and kill first day
[2:07:23] reggiepowa: Nope
[2:07:25] 94explorer: so hard to listen to asmos wow takes these days yeesh
[2:07:26] eyxx: the game should be perfect for everyone!!!!!!! xdd
[2:07:26] ShowDUH: so they fucked up for 20 years ...
[2:07:26] Kerkem: This is great content!
[2:07:27] zenkodac: ??
[2:07:27] noikex: true
[2:07:27] みょせつ: they're nerfing cuz bad players cant kill it
[2:07:28] Sothis_best_girl: his takes are so fucking bad, holy shit
[2:07:29] Kerkem: Im invested
[2:07:30] Cozo_TV: ye but bosses are not just gear check anymore also - strats are getting increasingly harder
[2:07:31] bladenkurama: maybe speed up redesign BGs and remove MMR from PvP
[2:07:33] jkJustice: he's gonna run out of fingers with how man he's pointing at other people LUL
[2:07:33] ShowDUH: holy shit trash take
[2:07:41] manlyhandles: such a massive BBoomer take
[2:07:42] torchedwood: aka mechanical skill has to be removed from the equation…
[2:07:43] Stephy_Mariee: how dare they not make everything completely perfect the first time around lol
[2:07:43] zenkodac: he wants the whole game to be like torghast
[2:07:44] spiritcheese: HUH i get it. he turns into a Classic Andy
[2:07:44] ThebluesBilly: @Squats3 ICC buff has 30% DR too
[2:07:45] Death_: just release the boss perfectly balanced 4Head
[2:07:45] BipolarPongal: Asmongold gonna make the next MMO xdd
[2:07:46] nayrcraig: How can he say that and also think the difficulties are bad?
[2:07:46] luixun: so he wants to kill each boss with the gear you got in day1 xD
[2:07:48] noikex: aberrus didn't had to be nerf and it was good
[2:07:48] GooseComics: @codydoubleu Lady vashj as well
[2:07:52] SpaEngi: Aware Torghast
[2:07:53] luixun: so ce is nothing anymore
[2:07:53] Maggaeri: back then?   when,  I don't remember any time since vanilla where every guild that raided was able to clear a raid
[2:07:54] zerossussy: i actually loved torghast
[2:07:54] Clox9: Im 100% with him on this make raiding easier I wanna raid with people raiding is dying off
[2:07:56] NotD4k: Hades GIGACHAD
[2:07:57] bigoldmeatpie: i mean...if it's as easy as he says it is why doesn't he apply to be on the encounter design team?
[2:07:59] jace193: but that's been like that since classicwow, like C'thun?
[2:07:59] jesterpots: torghast died when we couldnt continue power floor to floor
[2:08:03] zerossussy: torghast was absolutely fun
[2:08:04] Celestial990: Torghast was also too hard for lot of ppl so they had to nerf it
[2:08:06] Osterberg501: Dude can't keep roaches from walking on him, but he trying to talk about game development like this.
[2:08:06] vmaster11: i mean hes not wrong. It's just not a perfect world where everything is balanced perfectly. thats what makes the take dumb
[2:08:07] codydoubleu: @GooseComics true
[2:08:09] brewdweard: thats why I hated torghast
[2:08:12] Maggaeri: at least not on heroic, hardmode, or mythic (depending on the expac)
[2:08:14] stumie: @BipolarPongal He practically is with how much influence he has with asses of creation xdd
[2:08:18] fleks27: the threads of hey i cant get my mats for my legendary were omsame
[2:08:19] filos0phia: Look at the engagement Mage Tower had. People love that shit
[2:08:19] sanatalive: we all know asmon is just a casual andy nobody really cares what he thinks other than 12 yr olds
[2:08:20] ZACKandATTACK: @Maximum I hated torghast being a running simulator as a healing priest
[2:08:24] Sothis_best_girl: @Clox9 raiding *is* easy though, just not mythic LUL
[2:08:24] MattOogle: I hated Torghast. I suck at the game. Correlation = causation
[2:08:24] TheHallMonitor: getting benched because of RNG my fav
[2:08:25] guynormally: so remove power from mythic raid monkaHmm
[2:08:26] hickey7979: torghast was hard on the runs u didnt get godlike abilities
[2:08:26] freehawk1: Who wins the debate? Out of touch elitist who lives in a different reality or guy who hasn't played for 7 years????
[2:08:26] fleks27: insane
[2:08:28] Ivaed: @みょせつ bro not everyone is a good player. it's a MASS MULTIPLAYER GAME. Why are you designing this game like that? It's messed up.
[2:08:29] fugawe7: Week 1 torghast was lit
[2:08:30] trickyshot_: If you played a tank pre nerf torgast was EZ
[2:08:35] zerossussy: mage tower was purely cosmetic and it was fun because of it
[2:08:38] Konsu3: @stumie aoc comes out when we are all deadge
[2:08:42] BIuffwatcher: you dont need BiS unless you do that content?
[2:08:44] ThisIsAsabel: plus usually you would fail on the last floor on the last boss KEKW
[2:08:44] N3KKC: everybody knows the game gone to shit some of you guys are delusional
[2:08:46] ViiDak: how about people playing alts ? HAVING to do torghast every week on multiple chars was dogshit
[2:08:46] Maggaeri: in Sunwell only 3 guilds on my server even downed any of the bosses, and only one cleared it pre nerf
[2:08:46] nutz_hang_uneven: there should only be 2 raid difficulties mythic and normal
[2:08:48] Ivaed: it should be accessible to the majority
[2:08:51] Spibi_: the delta between how easy it was for some specs and how hard for some specs was massive in thorghast tho
[2:08:55] targus92dd: its was need. not "need". legendary was locked behind it.
[2:08:58] nayrcraig: @nutz_hang_uneven Why?
[2:09:00] traisc: Torghast was cool to do once, it wasn't cool every week
[2:09:01] Isolol: @Maggaeri Muru, slayer of guilds
[2:09:02] bladenkurama: value is all that matters there’s not enough value to me imo long term
[2:09:04] みょせつ: @Ivaed cause worse players can stick with heroic or kill the first 3 on mythic? why does mythic final boss have to be accessible to everyone?
[2:09:06] fokare: @n3kkc nah
[2:09:11] SniggleJake572: @nutz_hang_uneven why mythic? if you are going back to two just go normal and heroic again
[2:09:13] foobis_25: Mage Tower
[2:09:13] みょせつ: just git gud and kill it, it's not unkillable
[2:09:15] BabyDunn: so ffxiv ultimates then
[2:09:16] Tereekel: @freehawk1 Who wins the debate? Out of touch elitist who lives in a different reality or guy who hasn't played for 7 years????
[2:09:18] ill3stdrew: get gud
[2:09:19] ElderSeas: He and his community just hate the game. Because the thing they claim to love old wow exists in classic or SoD and they don't play it cuz they just don't like the game in any form anymore. But asmon has to make content about this because it's what his audience wants. It's exhausting at this point. And sad that he's still big enough that people have to respond
[2:09:25] vexprime: Is the issue that people want to be mythic raiders, when they/their guild aren't mythic guilds. Nerfing it down to the lowest common denominator. They wont be happy being a heroic guild.
[2:09:30] JoeSmoe495: Thats why the hardest raids in FF14 only drop cosmetics
[2:09:32] DasAutoChat: Not everyone need to have the best gear LUL
[2:09:33] backerxx: Torghast vs Mage Tower
[2:09:35] Lowdahl: Retail can become the Ultimate of WoW and classic can be for the normies who want bosses die in hours of release
[2:09:37] DanKnee16: I did torgast when I joined  in 9.2.5 and it was fun. I did it for achievements and not power
[2:09:38] Dintilion: @Maximum hellmodes in lost ark ?
[2:09:40] mathster09: why is the elitism angle bad, in a vacuum
[2:09:43] Zorto5: big shiny weapon
[2:09:50] tobbs94: hope they make another torghast that isent so dark and depressing that is fun to play challenging and you dont have to do it, such potential
[2:09:54] noirlol: ults are about fun + cosmetics + title
[2:09:54] luixun: gw2 the last raid
[2:09:55] frozenheartsqt: Maybe you should learn and play class better if you want to kill M+ bosses... Rather than having it catered to you
[2:09:56] Camelbak21: Nobody would care, and that's what people are asking for
[2:09:58] baddecisiondanx: i mean >95% of the community will never even see 2 last bosses on mythic if even that
[2:10:01] riddlerboy: I remember in the 1st ff14 expac, they nerfed the 1st savage raid im pretty sure
[2:10:06] BurtikShaun: There is also like 2 ultimates per expansion tho
[2:10:06] Sanctos304: why do you need bis if you aren't killing m tindral and fyrakk?
[2:10:06] spivet: the thing is wow doomers would still find a way to complain about it
[2:10:09] BipolarPongal: @stumie oh, boy. Hopefully it isn't all ass
[2:10:11] N3KKC: @fokare cope hard
[2:10:15] andaroo: @tobbs94 yeah the asthetics of it weren't great, but I loved Torgast
[2:10:17] BabyDunn: also sucks for watchers watching splits all week week 1
[2:10:17] Greannan: I think attendance falls off a cliff if you do that though
[2:10:17] Lara_TV_: I think that's the only solution for someone like me that wants to kill the hard versions of fights without raiding 4 days a week
[2:10:19] bladenkurama: it was really fun, the first couple times
[2:10:20] JWallace: but what do you need bis for if you aren’t doing the hardest content
[2:10:20] Ivaed: @みょせつ worse players dont want to stick to heroic they want to beat the whole game.
[2:10:21] guynormally: technically it solves all of these issues discussed
[2:10:24] nayrcraig: If gear is a pain, is Tournament Realm an option?
[2:10:25] CloudyHS: gachiBASS
[2:10:26] Razzin_: asmon is loot whore tho
[2:10:26] BipolarPongal: YEP COCK
[2:10:27] Spibi_: HUGE COCK
[2:10:28] Zlynnt: the gw2 rwf ended today, SC won
[2:10:30] sanatalive: asmon would stream wow every day if blizz sponsored him, otk doesn’t stream wow because blizz doesn’t sponsor them and they snub it
[2:10:30] grobb12: COCKA
[2:10:30] Namutski: so you admit they are making the game for how you guys gear LUL
[2:10:31] Vis4vengeance: @spivet 100%
[2:10:32] Ravaldknight: anyone who tells you ultimates dont get nerfed over time is lying to you lmao
[2:10:32] crud_r: Blend LFR and Norm. Cap Gear at Heroic. Mythic cosmetic only.
[2:10:33] Themselves: N3KKC nah
[2:10:37] bladenkurama: this is my first year like if I quit I probably never come back right
[2:10:39] antipheonixna: i mean thats not true cause u dont need bis to do anything, bis is what u get for doing the hardest, if u made mythic gear a 5% upgrade to the next highest level would it really matter
[2:10:49] zenkodac: the time people most liked in wow was when there was aspirational content but now they are arguing for not having any, cus for it to be accessible to the majority it has to be torghast
[2:10:49] spiritcheese: @N3KKC nah
[2:10:52] zenkodac: lol admit
[2:10:54] みょせつ: @Ivaed then learn to beat the game? it's literally not impossible and it 's rarely ever been.
[2:10:54] bigsemit: look at last guy in asmon chat LUL
[2:11:00] Namutski: ok ok ok i miss heard you earlier
[2:11:00] fokare: @n3kkc the game is fun, dragonflight is great. SOD is great, no cope here brother
[2:11:01] zenkodac: chatter things he did a gotcha
[2:11:03] AvalenaTV: *laughs in halondrus*
[2:11:04] zenkodac: thinks*
[2:11:06] Weslicus: holondrus anduin???
[2:11:07] BabyDunn: didnt Ion even confirm that he made one of the tiers hard as shit to punish yall?
[2:11:08] eyelashTV: it should just never be tuned for rtwf, thats a huge issue that anyone below top 50 world feels.
[2:11:10] donutboyj: they should just make a RWF server, dont make average mythic guilds suffer this hyper tuning
[2:11:10] meozart: asmongold wants content bosses. that way he can pug and beat and move on to another game. he forgets that there are wow players that still play wow almost everyday @maximum
[2:11:10] DranixOverlord: pvp
[2:11:11] Therealbrokensword: which by the way only around 150 people even got to pull
[2:11:12] Cakerinotv: not sepulchur but that was an outlier
[2:11:14] JoaEUW: Something i've never understood is how much casuals / lower rio players NEEDS the best gear and get bis and then doesnt push shit with it, like why do you need the best gear if you're not going to challenge yourself with pushing rio
[2:11:15] spivet: can't believe you ruined battlegrounds
[2:11:20] PinkTaricFTW: @maximum wow playerbase mostly does stuff for power. Cosmetics won't get enough people into mythic for it to be worth blizzard time to make it.
[2:11:20] ectocantaim: last chatter ICANT
[2:11:21] Lif3l3ss: He did not say that
[2:11:21] iciunoy: Bring back the speed raid races like Nyalotha Madge
[2:11:22] lordsellia: So to be fair, for most "regular" CE guilds, CE is aspirational; Farming mythic raid isn't possible for many, the gear is near irrelevant as the boss wont go down until end of season anyway
[2:11:24] Docaan: Professionals *pause*
[2:11:25] rpgonlyforme: i think that they need to slow gearing for the first month of a season, personally
[2:11:25] traisc: the issue with that statement is that only the last boss matters for the Race (and also for people trying to get CE) @Maximum
[2:11:25] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT Liquid/Echo
[2:11:26] Themselves: you ruined my pet battles fuck you max
[2:11:29] Superhank: what about tying accounts to real IDs so you only have 1 account and 1 of each class tops
[2:11:29] alarkin: Venruki had the best TL:DR on your podcast - Mythic is too hard. It sure is, it should not be a complicated debate, just reign it in, make the mode more accessible to more people, win win win. Fights like initial Tindral and Fyrakk need to vanish.
[2:11:29] BigTrout3: and m+
[2:11:29] cobaltheal: race to world first is why i cant have ice cream anymore
[2:11:30] Lif3l3ss: he said the competitive focus has ruined the game
[2:11:31] crucial1711: @Maximum so earlier what you were saying is if they designed it for yall at say a mid-tier ilvl, then there would be more head room for the rest of the players to overgear and overcome the fights.
[2:11:31] Mindtrick714: stop ruining my game mode bro!
[2:11:32] bladenkurama: I even had a very cool guild with awesome people still became a chore
[2:11:33] eyeztea: if they remove gear from mythic raid, nobody will raid anymore
[2:11:36] itsmacx: race to world first is the best content a wow enjoyer can watch
[2:11:36] GearzxGaming: RWF wholely makes this game better
[2:11:38] guyincognito101: guyincognito101 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! You did ruin DK last expansion tho.
[2:11:38] eyxx: he just pretends he hasn't moved on from the game and farms haters
[2:11:39] sanatalive: asmon would stream wow every day if blizz sponsored him, otk doesn’t stream wow because blizz doesn’t sponsor them and they snub it
[2:11:40] hacksel: so blizz tune it based on 2 guilds but they dont care about e sports, makes sense
[2:11:40] AvalenaTV: adge
[2:11:40] brienmusic: The race hasnt, the fixation on it does. Thats what he said
[2:11:40] yrp01: NGL as a heroic pleb , the heroic tier is the most accessible its ever been @Maximum so i dunno what this guy is moaning about
[2:11:42] Ivaed: @みょせつ the game is too hard now for most players to realistically do that. that's the whole arguement
[2:11:43] PeezyOG: there's aspirational content in the game now with cosmetic rewards aka the mage tower and even that's "too hard" and people want that shit to be handed to them
[2:11:43] berchberkins: i shift blame from liquid to echo based on who wins the most recent event
[2:11:47] 225oce: its just a bit for sure right
[2:11:47] yeyanow: The rwf is why I got back into wow lol
[2:11:47] maplelost: TRUU
[2:11:49] kdctheman: Adge
[2:11:53] TheHallMonitor: 2:30 adds wtf
[2:11:56] brienmusic: he didnt say the race ruins it
[2:11:58] Icydeadppl23: resubbed just to skip ads for this XD
[2:11:58] Artheeri: RWF ruined dreamsurges and archeology for me Sadge TrollDespair
[2:11:59] LionButLeon: xdd 󠀀
[2:11:59] EppatTV: Adge
[2:12:00] koutsoubilas: it is kinda true though
[2:12:03] frozenheartsqt: Way to ruin my Profession end game Max... I was really grinding it out :(
[2:12:03] hotmanpop: isnt RWF is a competition
[2:12:05] NickHotS: Competitive Raiding started in EverQuest not WoW
[2:12:08] Destrolisher: @brienmusic he literally did
[2:12:09] EasyBreezier: hadn't noticed it was since covid until you said it but that's 100% right
[2:12:09] FenixRuler: FenixRuler subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:12:10] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: @sanatalive i dont think bliz sponsors streamers ok
[2:12:12] Sothis_best_girl: WAY before covid, covid just accelerated it tbh
[2:12:13] Lara_TV_: Lmao
[2:12:13] crucial1711: @Maximum so earlier what you were saying is if they designed it for yall at say a mid-tier ilvl, then there would be more head room for the rest of the players to overgear and overcome the fights. 󠀀
[2:12:13] FortuneNA: can confirm I watch competitive skyrim videos
[2:12:16] Lara_TV_: what a clown
[2:12:20] malavander: anything that gets popular gets deconstructed by degenerates
[2:12:20] Goodvin: succ?
[2:12:20] lathander557: World first boss kill bragging rights have been around for the ENTIRE GAME
[2:12:21] Peber555: RWF ruined petbattles for me Sadge
[2:12:22] Blackiichan_: RWF ruined my weekly grocery shopping Sadge
[2:12:24] backerxx: I do think he has a point that WoW as an MMO might be more fun if it’s primary focus each content patch wasn’t the raid
[2:12:27] jimhasnotekkers: corruption was a genuinely amazing solution to this
[2:12:31] sanatalive: bro
[2:12:37] zenkodac: yea covid was just gasoline on a already raging fire
[2:12:39] codydoubleu: yeah he only wants loot, that's why he does the raid once and invites the highest Item level players possible
[2:12:43] jace193: even before the RWF people knew/know the best guilds on their server/region/in the game. the only difference is now we can watch it
[2:12:43] BipolarPongal: time for Bedge see you guys in 9 hours when this is still live
[2:12:47] targus92dd: Kungen was known, way before  RWF. race first has always been a thing
[2:12:48] Themselves: @jimhasnotekkers corruption also got them sued by cali gov
[2:12:49] bladenkurama: only takes 400 hours to finish half of leather working
[2:12:49] Lara_TV_: I am not happy even if I haven't gotten to the boss
[2:12:53] sanatalive: 7 ads = unfollow switch channel bye
[2:12:54] brienmusic: or they already stopped playing
[2:12:54] Stephy_Mariee: its just a lot of crying about mythic being "too hard"... most of it isnt too hard youre just bad. Literally get good or be a heroic raider lmfao youre not owed mythic
[2:12:57] Clindo_: RWF spilled my water Sadge
[2:13:00] Dekota3wow: one of the issues I have with BIS (Legendary)gear is, dropping off the last boss and it has no effect on the next season. You work so hard and it finally drops 2weeks before the end of the season.
[2:13:07] BipolarPongal: @sanatalive Messi scored Pog
[2:13:11] fokare: LUL he just genuinely hates raiding, he just wants the shit as quickly as possible. Of course he thinks hard raids suck
[2:13:12] noirlol: @Stephy_Mariee this
[2:13:12] timmayb166: man it’s crazy how higher your viewership goes when watching this troll
[2:13:13] dobi_gg: there is actually a ton of guilds who would like to progress the same boss as the top 20....
[2:13:16] Baglio: @sanatalive buy turbo crybaby
[2:13:27] Dehungerize: @sanatalive felt this to my core lol
[2:13:32] viciousalcoholic: @sanatalive broke boys don't deserve no kitty
[2:13:38] Qubuuuu: KEKW 󠀀
[2:13:39] bigsemit: imagine having ads
[2:13:42] uncred95: didn't they do that in shadowlands in sepulcher? it was a failure
[2:13:43] nayrcraig: @dobi_gg There is not "A Ton"
[2:13:45] Piki9: I'm starting to think the last 2 bosses being challenge/ultimates is the solution @maximum
[2:13:47] holmat: @sanatalive have u tried getting adblocker, it takes under 1 min
[2:13:47] Dcss97: 7 ads = unfollow switch channel bye
[2:13:53] donutboyj: problem is also, blizzard tunes bosses based on guild numbers, not based on actual difficulty of the boss
[2:13:54] BipolarPongal: How do you have ads xddShrug
[2:13:54] EasyBreezier: That and guilds at the lower end of CE are only getting 1 MAYBE 2 kills on last 2 bosses so they aren't getting bis anyway
[2:13:56] Greannan: Give everyone the mount when its killed but no gear.
[2:13:58] Weeniz: Chromaggus and Nefarian were by far the hardest parts of BWL in vanilla
[2:14:01] Themselves: sanatalive quit yappin
[2:14:02] belfastcl: I think he uses rwf and arenas as a concrete example
[2:14:03] caveman2x: my hot take is just making three difficulties ..  Heroic, Mythic, RWF
[2:14:03] Scriix: pre nerf muru, that was a fun one
[2:14:03] lmaoerss: @Dcss97 get an ad blocker lmao
[2:14:05] stumie: guild wars 2 LITERALLY just announced that their most recent boss is not gonna get nerfed and instead they're adding an additionally difficulty just for it. The challenge mode solution is dope.
[2:14:08] lathander557: All the way back to Chromaggus and Nef or Twin Emps and C'Thun buddy
[2:14:08] ThebluesBilly: the difference between LK HC and the rest is insane LUL so it's not new
[2:14:09] Piki9: But maybe would have to trim one of the lower difficulties?
[2:14:09] bladenkurama: RTW1 is one of the best things in the game I know that as a noob
[2:14:13] Dcss97: @lmaoerss i got turbo :D
[2:14:17] koutsoubilas: @Dcss97  plz dont
[2:14:19] goodmonsin: This feels like if you were complaining about follower dungeons ruining the games somehow
[2:14:22] ThisIsAsabel: super idea, because it would have a "sub-race" below pro level to get the challenge bosses HF, transmog, and prestige
[2:14:23] Richton867: He didn't say RWF was ruining the game. He said RWF was ruining chess.
[2:14:26] nanerpus_: And then people complain the gearing is too slow
[2:14:30] monster_mg: i kind of like watching that degen gearing content in the RWF
[2:14:39] Goodvin: cuz fuck keys!
[2:14:41] antipheonixna: more loot drops off mythic bosses but ilvs jump every 3 bosses
[2:14:42] Dcss97: @koutsoubilas sorry i will take my twitch turbo elsewhere TrollDespair
[2:14:44] noirlol: @noirlol (OR) just try to beat it in many many month - some people take 3-6months+ for ultimates to clear in FFXIV but every1 can do it if they keep trying. feels like people are entitled to clear mythic, insane.
[2:14:46] maplelost: we need god to nerf the boss
[2:14:49] crucial1711: Tbh sounds like people just need to get gud
[2:14:52] StarShopping95: KEKW
[2:14:52] nellfin: he said RWF turned chess into an FPS
[2:14:57] BipolarPongal: HAH Professional
[2:14:57] Stephy_Mariee: KEKW
[2:15:00] gronost4j: @Maximum the way player skill is distributed you still would need at least 2 waves of nerfs with gear changes - after top 5-10 guilds and then around hof fill
[2:15:01] zenkodac: they are just playing the game really well
[2:15:01] Larshouma: Saltimum
[2:15:01] hacksel: maximumPep

[2:15:04] stumie: MAX GOT AMZ NERFED DON"T LISTEN TO HIM HAH
[2:15:06] codydoubleu: @Maximum the most overlooked thing is that u can be 485+ without entering mythic raid and your character will basically be BiS

[2:15:17] dundlen: so many problems people have with the game are solved by them realizing they aren't good enough at the game, or aren't actually willing to put in the work to reach "perfection." I know im not good enough to mythic raid, and I don't want to put in the work to raid with a guild or pug, so my BiS is lfr + weekly quest rewards, and i'm happy with that.

[2:15:29] legitunplayable: chat around and find out
[2:15:31] saisu: why not just make all the rewards in mythic be cosmetic.
[2:15:32] Zyld: I know you are putting a lot of weight on the race to world first and "before it was streamed", but the competitive side of WoW has always existed, just more prominent TBC+. The previous form was who did it first and uploaded the video to warcraft movies, youtube, etc.

[2:16:00] zenkodac: there is not amount of "making the raid easier" that would appease these people
[2:16:00] JoaEUW: I honestly love watching content challenging asmongold, cause i know some of his takes are super wrong but im too stupid to find the reasons
[2:16:01] fleks27: crest system should probably ramp, aka get way less power from it week 1, more week 2 etc - serve as passive nerf without giga buffing us early
[2:16:01] eyxx: Pepega
[2:16:01] BigCizzle: what??
[2:16:02] Destrolisher: ???
[2:16:02] Cjpriest: they should totayllt take raids out of PTR 100%
[2:16:02] nanerpus_: Thats called heroic
[2:16:02] Arcinatos: sometimes i feel like he just says words
[2:16:03] Clindo_: ???? what is he even on about
[2:16:03] ren0m: At this point, I just think he's looking for reasons to hate on WoW to cater to his audience.
[2:16:07] aithran: the boss should suck for the people who actually play the game Dentge
[2:16:08] lonelyknight1922: do you guys remember when we thought incandecent essence would be impactful? LMAO good times

[2:16:21] ThisIsAsabel: this is not a way to reward passion of your most invested players
[2:16:22] rozlotte: ?????? that's entirely community perception
[2:16:23] Im_Jom: like how? if rashak just fell over it would suck.......
[2:16:25] Culphizad: they will tune everything the way that causes the most people to view and then play. RtWF is amazing to watch and gets more people to play, but they have to balance that against what those players can actually accomplish casually

[2:16:40] PvtCheese: @Vis4vengeance hes already pretty much said this, he doesnt want hard bosses or a challenge, he just wants to go and get loot
[2:16:41] SneakyWoodPecker: ITS 20X HARDER TO SEE MECHANICS
[2:16:43] MrDread: @Culphizad they do. They always nerf the bosses

[2:16:53] Cjpriest: @Atreayu LFR was a joke of an idea so probably
[2:16:53] Squats3: @Maximum you also have to realize that this is all coming from the guy that stopped streaming because of anxiety issues. he cant be fucked to do anything remotely stressful. cleaning his damn room is stressful to him
[2:16:54] BipolarPongal: YEP COCK
[2:16:56] fronkacean: @tettles
[2:16:56] Sentiaxx: Difficulty = skill level, and they've increased at the same pace
[2:16:56] hacksel: every raid needs at least 12 bosses with a secret fase last boss
[2:16:59] BayanY: same relative difficulty
[2:17:03] iLangston: How do I get your chat off the screen?
[2:17:04] Blazyrr: Weird cock FeelsWeirdMan
[2:17:07] Lothland: He just wants loot, but people play the game and raid for multiple different reasons. Asmon may only want loot but not everyone does. Mythic has issues that no magic bullet will fix for everyone. Too many people? Flex? Difficulty? ect.
[2:17:07] BipolarPongal: @tettles HAH professional
[2:17:08] spiritcheese: @SneakyWoodPecker no its not
[2:17:11] huntercreeper54: horizontal cock Pog
[2:17:11] Superhank: not phallic enough
[2:17:12] HoseiYamasaki: A lot more one shot/raid wipe mechanics nowadays imo
[2:17:14] od3x: Linear skill prog with raid diff
[2:17:14] BigTrout3: @squats3 oof
[2:17:15] SniggleJake572: tomb was insane
[2:17:16] ketamemezxd: @maximum He just hates how people approach games. Company's aren't the key drivers its players
[2:17:16] ktthemage: the entire problem is that Asmongold doesn't like the game anymore, and he can't let go of how it was when he enjoyed it. That's 100% the issue. He hasn't liked WoW in a long time and needs to mvoe on.
[2:17:17] Razdruid: I think some bosses are def way harder than tomb
[2:17:18] garynrex2: its harder for new players right
[2:17:21] MajorFrog225: so since 1% of people are better then we should make the whole game harder?
[2:17:23] Xarconos: @Maximum the longer a game goes on, the better the players get. Pro players from season 1 of league look like Platinum (mid tier) players now
[2:17:25] Schrootpoot: @Maximum might be relevant. GW2 new challenge mode boss finally got beaten today after 9 days. It's so difficult they will nerf it, but as a new difficulty level and leave this version in for those  that want the challenge. Will be interesting if they keep doing this in the future.
[2:17:26] antipheonixna: i mean m+ is also making players better, its way harder than from legion
[2:17:27] Razdruid: except for KJ
[2:17:27] not_jhaycen: kj was literally do you have enough rogues the boss
[2:17:28] gyser13: Tomb was a terrible raid period
[2:17:29] bladenkurama: mostly a PC check lmfao
[2:17:31] danksly: Mythic should be hard like real fun hard and if u can't do it go spend a month or 2 farming the gear somewhere else
[2:17:33] BobAwesome: Mythic KJ is hardest fight for me
[2:17:34] bolibombi: @MajorFrog225 the whole game? xdd

[2:17:46] adobegainz1: Yeah Avatar and KJ was ridiculous to be honest.

[2:17:52] maplelost: Echo said they need the RWF to be longer than Aberrus or its not worth it
[2:17:56] targus92dd: @ktthemage yup, this is true
[2:17:58] crucial1711: @Maximum so earlier what you were saying is if they designed it for yall at say a mid-tier ilvl, then there would be more head room for the rest of the players to overgear and overcome the fights.
[2:17:59] frozenheartsqt: @MajorFrog225 Maybe don't do the hardest end content if you arent ready??
[2:18:02] iLangston: Can you move your chat @Maximum ?
[2:18:02] BLACKFOOT_TN: I think they made fights too highly tuned to the point its not fun anymore. Its just pain. Reclearing its pain.
[2:18:02] hacksel: ofc you were rank 7, i was rank 5 Kappa
[2:18:02] hapjaa: Chatting i was in echo
[2:18:05] BipolarPongal: I was in Rank 6 guild. I think they should make raid for everyone else
[2:18:06] SkrrtRussel: rank 7 in ohio
[2:18:11] hotmanpop: @bolibombi i think he meant getting the best gear, harder to get
[2:18:12] Lothland: @MajorFrog225 It's not just 1%, every player that has played this game for a long time is insanely better than they were years ago, thats just how it works.
[2:18:12] JoaEUW: Bro there was a long ass post on reddit about some guys guild disbanding cause the raid was too easy
[2:18:12] nutz_hang_uneven: @squats3 I can hear the gamer rage in this
[2:18:12] codydoubleu: seems like he will always just hate the hardest content if he doesnt want to get good enough to do it
[2:18:14] Larshouma: Mythic Raiders are mostly not as good as people think, they have freetime to spend on the game that's it. hundreds of pulls per boss is not "being good"
[2:18:14] Tereekel: Ignore the race*
[2:18:15] Malicone: hardest wow boss was gothik the harvester in classic.
[2:18:18] SniggleJake572: @SkrrtRussel lol
[2:18:21] aithran: i was in rank 3 guild, i agree ok
[2:18:27] gyser13: @adobegainz1 Avatar made me quit for the rest of that season on mythic
[2:18:29] Ivaed: yeah but then the raid would die in 3 days and Blizz wouldnt get their 2 weeks of free advertising from content creators
[2:18:29] mynameis_Emil: even if thats what you want they will never do that because the race is too popular for them to ignore
[2:18:30] BipolarPongal: @aithran fuck, beat me to it
[2:18:31] poopstain221: im in liquid i agree ok
[2:18:34] antipheonixna: dont show or test the mythic phases for any boss before they release, reduce the difficulty a bit
[2:18:36] Ravaldknight: classic is always there if you want easy raids guys, its okay to aim low Okayge
[2:18:37] Cakerinotv: ??
[2:18:39] nanerpus_: So he is saying they shouldnt ever nerf?
[2:18:43] CloudyHS: ???
[2:18:45] Slapsstick: @Larshouma COPIUM
[2:18:45] zenkodac: every time there is one of these epic bosses the community mostly rose to the challange and someone in the world cleared it be it KJ or Unaat or Holondrus or Tindral
[2:18:45] crucial1711: @Larshouma based, who knew liquid and echo were actually bad players
[2:18:47] mortenerenroleplayer123: @Maximum no amount of gear would help any guild on fights like tindral and halondrius

[2:19:04] Sothis_best_girl: he started with a cook, but then threw in 5 kilos of salt
[2:19:05] huntercreeper54: i'm in a secret guild better than even liquid and echo and i agree ok
[2:19:06] goodmonsin: and it got nerfed everyt week right?
[2:19:07] Morayeden: He's saying it should be as hard as it was
[2:19:07] drbonesawmd: so just leave the nerfs
[2:19:08] aithran: bro is cooked
[2:19:08] ianek: ????
[2:19:11] daedri: I think he's basically saying it's not really evergreen so it isn't aspirational
[2:19:12] HoseiYamasaki: Its the ff14 take
[2:19:13] antipheonixna: its not aspirational content, mythic raid is for mythic raiders
[2:19:14] infraxtion: hogger should be just as tough at cap as it was in vanilla at level 10
[2:19:16] goodmonsin: you got scaling things to make it easier
[2:19:17] maplelost: WoW be dead
[2:19:18] Peber555: monakS
[2:19:20] Austrian: o7
[2:19:21] Greannan: Naw, thats overcooked. Killing Tindral 2 weeks ago didnt feel bad at all
[2:19:21] Diazanite: so is his take you should only kill every boss a single time otherwise every kill after means literally nothing or?
[2:19:22] Xarconos: o8
[2:19:22] Larshouma: @crucial1711 I said mostly, not 100 of them, learn to read, ty
[2:19:23] fleks27: *dies*
[2:19:23] NotD4k: o7
[2:19:23] Xarconos: o7
[2:19:25] kheim: and Method Kappa
[2:19:26] nayrcraig: Wow is saved o7
[2:19:27] sabaron: comparison is the thief of joy, why compare yourself to rank 1/2 guilds
[2:19:27] zenkodac: and the boss was nerfed in other way, like giving a 20% damage buff
[2:19:28] nairb1: ez method first
[2:19:29] BigTrout3: o7
[2:19:29] joe_g_433: I cant with these takes right now.... He must have been low on views
[2:19:30] straifulove: that's how ff14 works tho
[2:19:30] Imsooriginal_wow: he's right lich king is way too easy, my little brother killed it last night after only 40 tries
[2:19:33] Jjmn12: Fat Shark Yes ruined the game Madge
[2:19:33] dwolf010: yesterday he said it was fucking cool to see your self get more powerfull and one shot stuff. and now he says this. he does not know what he want
[2:19:34] BipolarPongal: o7 WoW is saved
[2:19:34] koutsoubilas: yeah he means the content is not relevant through the game itself
[2:19:34] CloudyHS: o7
[2:19:35] panda_bearx3: panda_bearx3 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:19:36] meozart: what? he didn’t kill lk when he had 0 ice buff. wtf is he talking about
[2:19:37] maplelost: wow is esports heavy how can u remove the top competitors thats crazy
[2:19:38] biffhh: WORLD FIRST LETS GO
[2:19:39] Diazanite: because that take sounds beyond idiotic
[2:19:41] Themselves: @straifulove yea and its a shit weeb game who cares
[2:19:43] Melati: Snap again and save wow
[2:19:44] brammertime: called skill gap
[2:19:48] Tooyoo: Literally happened to Asmongold's guild in nighthold
[2:19:49] Nel_28: But after SOFO didn't blizz kinda admit they didn't need to make bosses for rwf? Like they said something to the affect of we give up. And now one xpac later were right back here
[2:19:49] crud_r: RWF is just buzz for top 1% of 1%
[2:19:49] Cozo_TV: lich king had a 5%/week mechanic anyway
[2:19:50] fronkacean: @biffhh gz on the ring buddy
[2:19:50] Lindorn_: when they make it, they have to over shoot or just get more xavius'
[2:19:50] MajorFrog225: nah bruh you guys raid on a full time schedule
[2:19:53] DasAutoChat: Why does everyone feel like they should have the bis gear LUL
[2:19:55] BathingBear: Sunwell got nerfed
[2:19:55] own3dzz: beating the lich king today is the equivalent of going back to grade 6 and passing a math quiz
[2:19:56] HealsAndThat: The fyrakk version you killed, is not do-able for me and my guild within the first 3 months of the raid releasing LUL
[2:19:56] yeahp0n: basically raiding has never been good. Especially nax, because it took a month right? lol
[2:19:56] Artheeri: @infraxtion yeah hogger should be a worldboss that drops mythic gear (a difficult one) but not too difficult because thar would be elitest and you needed addons to do the fight for oyu
[2:19:57] Greannan: There are still guilds at 700 wipes on Tindral
[2:19:58] omgwatlol: if echo/method dissapear, other guilds will just take their place lol, different names same race as always
[2:19:59] BLACKFOOT_TN: Yeah but. Isn't this a internal testing issue?
[2:19:59] alarkin: I think raids would be easier if the RWF wasn't a thing though - and that isn't assigning responsibility - I think Blizz feels pressured for that product, regardless of why, and it does have an effect
[2:20:00] maplelost: @Themselves yeah fack those xbox weebs
[2:20:01] mortenerenroleplayer123: did they not have to nerf lich king, when the boss is dog shit easy?
[2:20:01] Twyzted_f8: @maximum lol he says it’s not aspirational but then is asking for nerfs that you should aspire beat without.  But because he just wants loot, they want handouts
[2:20:01] hacksel: CThun was impossible until it was not
[2:20:03] Weslicus: it wasnt a 100% confiremd to happen before
[2:20:04] spivet: what a strange perspective to have
[2:20:06] straifulove: @Themselves that's my fav game, i care :3
[2:20:07] minatozakixQ: LUL
[2:20:07] Themselves: maplelost BASED
[2:20:07] noirlol: ICANT 󠀀
[2:20:08] spiritcheese: HUH
[2:20:08] owoWobo: why does mythic need to be beatable for everyone anyway?
[2:20:09] puddypounce: ???
[2:20:10] meozart: he had to have a icc buff to kill lk what is he talking about
[2:20:10] Crystallize007: @biffhh 💀
[2:20:11] m_dep: agreed
[2:20:11] Filipe_idk: monkaHmm what
[2:20:14] Archmage_Michael: I also think mythic bosses should only receive bugfixes and not nerfs. if i can't beat the boss even with full gear, then so be it. I agree that it's just charity if a boss is nerfed so many times
[2:20:14] dundlen: single player games get nerfs
[2:20:15] nanerpus_: Congrats you just created Emerald Nightmare
[2:20:15] aithran: JUST BE PERFECT GG
[2:20:18] dundlen: like wtf
[2:20:18] zenkodac: the take of someone who never made a game
[2:20:18] Themselves: straifulove as long as u own it bla
[2:20:20] PrimeTimeRime: @max when has anything ever been released in a perfectly tuned form. stfu asmon
[2:20:20] biffhh: @Crystallize007  doggoArrive
[2:20:21] BigTrout3: just be perfect
[2:20:22] EasyBreezier: Never have nerfs seems pretty unrealistic
[2:20:24] zubulluu: Most guilds still take 300+ pulls on these nerfed bosses, how is that not aspirational content?
[2:20:26] Deathkiller93: what about banning weakauras?
[2:20:27] Walk_Brass: even elden ring had nerfs, that's wild
[2:20:27] spivet: the actual way to do that would be to make raiding as hard as it was in classic, which is what he actually wants
[2:20:28] eyxx: if your game isn't perfect, it's trash xdd
[2:20:29] klamonte: make every raid as piss easy as molten core -Asmongold
[2:20:31] ill3stdrew: you would have to go back to classic style raids where shit just falls over
[2:20:31] zerossussy: no nerf bosses can be fine
[2:20:31] MattOogle: I think the idea of I beat this boss at a 20% nerf value more than what Max and his guild beat it at so my achievement is less, is stupid.
[2:20:32] Lothland: They have had to nerf fucking SOD bosses lol
[2:20:33] PrimeTimeRime: imagine never needing to tune anything lmao
[2:20:40] danksly: Heroic is actually the issue, it's too easy for a large part of the community to feel  so they can not complain about not doing mythic if its made any harder even more of the community is bumped down to only clearing normal imo
[2:20:40] Quomz: it hurting him personally when something is nerfed?
[2:20:42] monster_mg: what about another dungeon tier higher than mythic, no gear improvements from it
[2:20:43] glorkwimp: @owoWobo I agree totally, mythic isn't supposed to be able to be killed by everyone
[2:20:44] Wildfire_Gaming: my guild just got to Tindral, we realized the rest of the raid was a completely different difficulty level
[2:20:44] Lyonidus: denathrius
[2:20:45] Crystallize007: I remember how ICC was definitely not nerfed every single week by a random aura :)
[2:20:45] juuno106: some bosses being unkillable seems cool
[2:20:45] lathander557: Elden ring gets nerfs, checkmate moron
[2:20:46] yeyanow: Why nerfs are good? It allows you to put our something challenging and then tune it back based on the playerbase.
[2:20:48] danksly: Dam chatting xdd
[2:20:49] CalionHut: you would need good players testing every boss to be able to do that
[2:20:50] SpaEngi: i never seen raid balance in classic
[2:20:50] meozart: he hated emerald nightmare. and that raid was way under tuned
[2:20:51] malavander: It's impossible unless you make the game like chess and homogenize every system in the game
[2:20:52] NotReallyAdrian: but then they need to be very careful with mechanics and how hard they are
[2:20:55] Azikielboi: he doesnt want it to be nerfed by gear either, he gave the lich king example @Maximum
[2:20:55] Ravaldknight: find me a live service game that has no nerfs or buffs lmao acting like this is some original sin that only blizzard performs
[2:20:55] deadie3D: nighthold was gear nerfed 100%
[2:20:56] Xarconos: @Maximum he is someone who only plays for gear, he dislikes challenge. his opinions on challenges mean nothing
[2:20:57] Teddsan: consolidate normal and hc
[2:20:57] holmat: Ap
[2:20:59] traisc: what if they gave Heroic a raid ID like Mythic? would that solve the issue? @Maximum
[2:20:59] misdota: abberus was a semi-anomaly because of how FAST we hit 441. they even increased the gear gap this tier bc of that
[2:20:59] Turkeypitz: has anyone stopped to consider maybe its in Blizzards interest to have 'hard' content which allows attention to be brought to content that would otherwise be trivial. Someone going to be able to do it, and somsones going to be upset beccause they can't
[2:21:00] adobegainz1: Imagine if Tindral wasn't nerfed whatsoever 95% of mythic raiders would be hardstuck on him Lmao
[2:21:00] Greannan: Mechanics are very 1shotty as well
[2:21:02] chaos_terrain: more numerical difficulty, and less mechanical difficulty
[2:21:03] Ivaed: i agree. nerfing a boss says you made the fight too hard and you messed up. It's a failure of game design.
[2:21:03] whitexscale: How big would the power creep be then? Having 20 percent haste vs 35 percent haste and the end of the expansion is pretty real
[2:21:05] Slapsstick: they should just not nerf the next raid and see how many people can clear it
[2:21:08] kappey_: the fast gearing system is the problem
[2:21:11] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT Liquid/Echo ruining WoW
[2:21:11] Tereekel: @larshouma the rwf raiders are absolutely much better than most of the population, especially the top two. The total amount of time on a boss spent by lower tier guilds is always much longer than those two guilds, every tier always. The rwf time is not the only thing that separates them
[2:21:12] ZACKandATTACK: Nerfs are fine, they just need to come way quicker and be more heavy handed.
[2:21:13] BurntMrWaffles: that was the case for nylotha correct? very minimal nerfs
[2:21:15] jimhasnotekkers: I swear the way corruption ramped gear in BFA s4 solved a lot of this.
[2:21:20] KaiaGT: I feel this way, I personally dont enjoy getting CE at the end of the tier after several nerfs, I can't feel the same way as someone who did it without nerfs or after jut a few nerfs. And ive been getting CE this last tiers
[2:21:23] kj01a: Holy sh*t I just agreed with a thing asmongold said. Something bad is going to happen O.O
[2:21:24] yeyanow: I don't understand why nerfing is inherently bad?
[2:21:24] lathander557: Mechanical difficulty curves are crazy because of the defensive problem Max has been talking about lately, it's all entwined
[2:21:24] zenkodac: people were always sweats about gearing i imagine
[2:21:26] hacksel: Guys they need to nerf bosses otherwise Liquid and Echo run out of budget and have to go home and kill it online after 1 month
[2:21:36] aithran: just give players +vers every week ok
[2:21:51] Lenietwitch: SLG got harder because stop dps lol
[2:21:53] Azikielboi: he wants the hardest bosses to be possible by him in the same gear you do it in, he doesnt want there to eb things harder than he (or people around the skill level he thinks the game should be based around) are capable of
[2:21:55] antipheonixna: i mean you could have a quest or weekly clear requirement to unlock more crest tiers, buff players instead of nerf raid
[2:22:02] PinkTaricFTW: @maximum what if they did 1 lockout for all difficulties? So you can kill a boss once per week regardless of difficulty?
[2:22:07] crucial1711: It really feels like asmon doesn't want anything challenging put in the game, mythic was never intended to be cleared by everybody. It was meant to be hard. Heroic was meant to be the challenge cleared by everyone.
[2:22:07] McBayne: @Lenietwitch this! ty
[2:22:07] spivet: the stupid part of this is classic is what he describes, and people are still gear/parse demons who hyper optimize
[2:22:13] Manu7: SLG got easier because of bugfixes lol
[2:22:14] BigTrout3: give players Determination stacks every reset YEP just like LFR
[2:22:16] timmayb166: why can’t people just stick to heroic instead of mythic if they have these opinions
[2:22:22] zenkodac: also are we pretending that even if tindral was released in the form its now that more then 30 guild would get to it first week?
[2:22:23] JanSladkovsky: so for the first month they make it that you can get for only one character items from raid weekly and it would be fine right?
[2:22:23] c10starburst: @Maximum ok so with both of the takes wouldn't it just benefit blizzard to just make an MDI type event for Mythic raiding putting the top guilds against each other on a tourney realm and have the nerfed versions be live? i mean it should be viable seeing how you say that RWF is good for blizzard with viewership attention to game and resubs for new tier?
[2:22:27] seangelma: the helmet enchant was an interesting way to make nerf content that they havnt done before i dont think
[2:22:27] BrandonAUS: am late here, don't watch asmon much, but he isn't much of a wow player anymore right?
[2:22:33] texazbandit: which is wack
[2:22:36] nanerpus_: Sounds like bringing back personal loot
[2:22:38] maplelost: 3 day RWF lets go
[2:22:39] spiritcheese: why is nerving bad? better to Hard and don´t  "one Shot" the boss
[2:22:43] luixun: when you never nerf a boss ppl will not clear it because the skill gap would be to high. or you lose all myth raider because you can push them over
[2:22:44] texazbandit: yall should do it on your own
[2:22:48] Lenietwitch: @timmayb166 agree, but ppl are fucking whiners that wants all the gear just by showing uip and no challenge xD
[2:22:49] JWallace: is there a way blizzard can stop splits
[2:22:49] Dekota3wow: He still mad I (BM Hunter) killed him (Pally) twice in open world PVP back in BfA. so he is lashing out on everyone....
[2:22:50] Arcinatos: @BrandonAUS he's more of a tourist
[2:22:54] Greannan: thats literally mythic
[2:22:56] yeyanow: Community helpers does seem to have some upside of a feeling like helping your favorite guild
[2:22:57] ThebluesBilly: ulduar was nerfed to hell LUL
[2:23:03] BabyDunn: each guild that kill mythic last boss nerfs those bosses by 1% per new kill. ez (/s)
[2:23:03] nanerpus_: Hell yeah every raid is Emerald Nightmare now
[2:23:06] huntercreeper54: including splits or not?
[2:23:07] crud_r: The mechanical requirement of some of these bosses even for mid CE guilds is still insane. in a 2-3 day it's just 2-3 months of lockouts and dodging whammies until your guild dies or not on the last 2.
[2:23:15] dogsenses: everything he says is irrelevant is he a meme streamer not an actual high end player
[2:23:19] sendos_gg: yes
[2:23:21] Wildfire_Gaming: no xdd
[2:23:22] Archmage_Michael: yes
[2:23:24] Teddsan: ofcourse
[2:23:27] zenkodac: the reason why blizzard was even comfortable tuning the last 2 bosses for the raid is because historically just the top 5 reach the last boss first reset
[2:23:27] fokare: 99.9% of people don’t raid mythic
[2:23:27] NotReallyAdrian: xdd hey it's me the fool
[2:23:30] TL_izPanda: you would be someone who's job requires it to not be LOL
[2:23:30] Basic_3: but the race being good is such great advertising for the game.
[2:23:35] backerxx: do you think a magical split ban or some sort of artificial ilvl cap week 1-2 would make the game easier for them to balance?
[2:23:35] thegrt13: @Maximum what about a "contest mode" till the world first kill like destiny has. having a max item level possible
[2:23:42] zerossussy: i'd love to watch a real RWF forever, its just as much entertaining as watching MDI/TGP if not more
[2:23:43] crucial1711: But mythic doesn't apply to 99% of the playerbase, it applies to likely less than 1% of the playerbase.
[2:23:45] zenkodac: and thats not to speak of times wf kills took 40 or more days
[2:23:45] pudkud: Are we going to acknowledge that he was never that great at games and he is advocating for the dumbing down to meet his level?
[2:23:49] TheSHAYdynasty: if they nerf the raids to be 1-2 day raids, echo would just come to NA
[2:23:49] Lyonidus: 3 day race would be boring
[2:23:49] PleaseLessen: our 2 night guild took 200 pulls to kill nerfed M Smolderon, we wouldn't have killed 4 orb, 5 wave version. I am glad they nerfed it so we got a chance to prog it
[2:23:51] JWallace: easy raids makes the game even more seasonal
[2:23:53] ThebluesBilly: they already explain why they stopped hard modes LUL
[2:23:57] Archmage_Michael: tournament realm for RWF with normalized gear. problem solved
[2:23:57] iWatchPeoplePlayStuff: The base point is that you are willing to do these degenerate/cringe things. Sure, if you didn't do it, others will but the point is that it still happens. This singular behavior cascades into design and difficulty.
[2:24:01] BipolarPongal: I dunno why LFR exists
[2:24:03] dwolf010: didnt they do it with fated? he could turn off the affixes no?
[2:24:05] BigTrout3: remove lfr Dentge
[2:24:07] NotReallyAdrian: we had 4 difficulties in MoP as well
[2:24:08] brainrot_behavior: oh snap boys he is almost 20 minutes in
[2:24:11] Old_Tomatoes: Theres 2 too many
[2:24:11] aithran: no it's not worth it, i can't procrastinate for weeks if the race ends in 3 days xdd
[2:24:12] Morayeden: How was it not artificial?  HUH
[2:24:12] Basic_3: @TheSHAYdynasty Viewership would collapse and both guilds would lose all their funding first.
[2:24:14] FrilleJr: lfr doesnt count
[2:24:15] BabyDunn: i think they do it cause the ilvl gap is larger per tier
[2:24:17] antipheonixna: keep mythic phases off testing, send the boys in but slightly easier raid
[2:24:21] Goltez: you have to understand the huge % of people that dont do even normal raid
[2:24:22] ZACKandATTACK: @Maximum The medium ground is making the end bosses hard for the RWF crowd and then actually nerfing them down for the average max ilvl guild to complete
[2:24:23] pudkud: And we are spending a lot of time on the opinion of a mid
[2:24:24] Excogitative: Sire Pog
[2:24:25] Azikielboi: the complaint is that when you know people are beating things harder tahn you can, you feel less cool @Maximum
[2:24:28] yeyanow: What is natural about anything in a video game? What is this distinction?
[2:24:30] dorki: cause mythic gives the best ilvl gear
[2:24:34] yassydk: Because you have to progress the same bosses 2 to 3 times and by the time you get to the level you want to prog half of your raid team is burnt out
[2:24:37] alarkin: @crud_r This, this is the core issue. This needs to be shouted and repeated, over and over and over. Excellent guilds get this wonderful long break, between tiers, to do whatever they want, which makes sense in a seasonal game. It does not make sense that 1000s of guilds do not, if they ever want to scratch at CE. This disparity can and should be fixed.
[2:24:40] cheese_beaver: baseg chads
[2:24:42] zenkodac: heroic first week is super fun challange
[2:24:43] BrandonAUS: lfr is needed for a lot to see the game, go do lfr and see how many people still struggle, it makes sense to keep lfr
[2:24:45] talkley: thats what i DO
[2:24:47] Zlynnt: Sounds like he should play gw2 PepeLaugh
[2:24:48] andaroo: As someone who almost pushes Mythic Raid - Heroic and Normal give us a lot of recruitment options, and LFR is fine - just don't engage with it
[2:24:51] comFox: based take
[2:24:51] shaddaveli: as a classic andy, i dig LFR
[2:24:52] Faraday5001: ilvl bloat is the only bad thing imo
[2:24:52] Arcinatos: boogeyman YEP
[2:24:53] KaisenSiru: LFR doesnt affect me at all
[2:24:54] texazbandit: because the gear is bad lol
[2:24:54] Old_Tomatoes: There is more people who clear heroic then people who only clear normal
[2:24:55] BigDawgDan: defensive?
[2:24:57] cheados: king take
[2:24:58] Maruika: it drops tier
[2:24:58] Chunks_WoW: Based take
[2:24:58] Wolfcamcx: LFR is storymode and thats a goodthing
[2:24:59] SyMmBoLz: @maximum yup just had a baby, normal was good enough for me this time around hahaha
[2:25:00] JERAULT: if you dont want to do lfr, dont do it. there are people who do like it
[2:25:01] m_dep: my wife is an AOTC raider and only got into raiding by trying it on LFR first
[2:25:01] Nenemene: DELETE WEAKAURAS
[2:25:02] lathander557: THE MYTHIC ILVL GAP IS SMALLER WITH UPGRADE TRACKS it's fine to be the way it is now
[2:25:04] GooseComics: Remove LFR. Make NORMALE queable
[2:25:04] brewdweard: i spent all of MOP as an LFR tank.
[2:25:04] texazbandit: everyone wants the good gear
[2:25:05] mantooth11: aspect crests and mythic vault rewards in heroic raids fix so much of this
[2:25:05] backerxx: LFR is harder than RWF
[2:25:05] vidris: i love lfr
[2:25:05] Tereekel: @iwatchpeopleplaystuff which is exactly why he has always said they should ignore what the rwf guilds do and make content for the rest of the players
[2:25:06] McBayne: normal and heroic should be one
[2:25:07] BLACKFOOT_TN: LFR affects pugs not guilds.
[2:25:09] cheese_beaver: without lfr new players would quit so fast @Maximum
[2:25:09] Llarrow: @Maximum I think they only bad thing about lfr was when Titanforging was a thing
[2:25:09] omgwatlol: old man yells at ~cloud~ LFR
[2:25:10] donutboyj: @crud_r pretty much, mid guilds are not set up to succeed, they will only ever be a stepping stone to a real CE guild as things are now
[2:25:12] Squats3: @Maximum because they are good enough to do normal so lfr bad. they are not good enough to do mythic, so mythic bad
[2:25:12] sabaron: its all just about wanting the same gear as the top players really
[2:25:12] MajorFrog225: tier and legendary
[2:25:12] not_jhaycen: the only negative i see of LFR is that i have to do it for certain shades of gear XD
[2:25:14] slappadabas5: Agree...I just mount farm and LFR until I can't get upgrades
[2:25:14] kheim: My biggest pet peeve is that a +16  key gives  the same crests for upgrading as mythic raiding
[2:25:15] DranixOverlord: Perhaps it makes ilvl gap larger @Maximum ?
[2:25:15] Kenigami: because u can get legendary in lfr xD
[2:25:15] talkley: i want to raid but i only have select hours to play and i cant spend my whole time finding a group
[2:25:15] Audurr: Especially for those that can't make scheduled raid times
[2:25:16] streatmagic_gaming: LFR is also a great chance to try new roles that you're not a comfortable on
[2:25:17] hotdogmartyr: i was an LFR andy for my first season. Helped me learn the game.
[2:25:18] Ruinx81: WoW gatekeeping is so weird
[2:25:20] JansonLives: LFR is a great training dummy that moves.
[2:25:20] JonatanXaD: I have 700 wipes on Tindral, min maxing classes, we're from SA so everyone has 200ms, we lost a dk tank due to fucking boredom of a patch, now we were left with war/monk tank and the difference is insane, these things shouldn't be a problem to kill a second to last boss on week 100000 after realease, it feels kinda trash, I know we're not the greatest, but that shouldn't be an issue at this point, I like challenging content, this is ridiculous tho
[2:25:21] RowanWeir: for the most part my goals are to just get 4 piece and any trinkets that look interesting on the characters I want to play.
[2:25:23] lonelyknight1922: what post is he reading? who wrote it?
[2:25:23] texazbandit: no it is true
[2:25:24] Mani1301: Because the loudest voices are the ones not complaining about not experiencing the content but not being able to have the best things
[2:25:25] Cakerinotv: @maximum the only argument is ilvl bloat in lfr
[2:25:28] Basic_3: They choose how much those ilvl gaps are. Not the number of difficulties
[2:25:32] JanSladkovsky: I am just so sad you cant really pug mythic with all these fucking locks for instances etc. Juts make it for pugs same as heroic so we can actually try it out
[2:25:34] PinkTaricFTW: @maximum gear inflation is the problem with 4 difficulties
[2:25:34] rpgonlyforme: i kinda think lfr should just have mogs
[2:25:40] Starcillo: Main issue have always been weakauras and addons
[2:25:40] Johra92: Ive seen a lot of people argue that it takes away from the social aspect of the game. LFR is one of the many big changes that make it so that people do group content without social interaction. And works against joining a guild
[2:25:41] BrandonAUS: Right now gearing system for most is fine with m+ and upgrade paths, it's chill outside first few weeks
[2:25:44] zenkodac: i hate that all of these takes are based on somehow your experience being compromised by how others play the game, like if someone want to go super hard in a mmo why would that even matter to someone doing heroic?
[2:25:46] bayazijr: Nerf M+ gear
[2:25:47] ArcaneSyntax: It's not true because of ilvl overlap of the different difficulties
[2:25:50] Morayeden: 10%
[2:25:51] spiritcheese: @Maruika you get your set tier from the forge so its whatever
[2:25:52] ThisIsAsabel: yeah it's artificial anyway, ilevel impact is designed trough numbers by Blizz
[2:25:54] Lenietwitch: make lfr story mode and not drop same loot, if you wanna experience it with friends you can, but blizz fill it with bots
[2:25:58] GearzxGaming: easily 3 difficulties
[2:26:00] belfastcl: that's the graph you made basically
[2:26:00] Sanctos304: the reason people don't like 4 difficulties is they feel bad not clearing mythic, so having 1 difficulty requires it to be easier and they can feel they are doing the max content
[2:26:00] tarth_100: Doesn't the gap have to be the way it so, so that  you can 'outgear' each individual tiier at some point and over power the bosses?
[2:26:02] Galarian_Hp: bth,  LfR is harder than normal if u look at the players and their gear/skill
[2:26:03] puddypounce: time for epic difficulty
[2:26:05] fuzzli420: Mother
[2:26:07] eyxx: and his conclusion will probably be to remove mythic xdding
[2:26:09] Cakerinotv: Yeah 3 difficulties
[2:26:11] woody1836: gREAT TOILET CONTENT
[2:26:15] kheim: @JonatanXaD That sounds like a skill issue for the new tanks, not a class issue
[2:26:18] alarkin: And that's the only part that matters, at all. Mythic is not in a good place, and something fundamental needs to change.
[2:26:19] brainrot_behavior: professional difficulty incoming
[2:26:23] baddecisiondanx: @Maximum maybe i'm out of pocket but i think the majority of people are getting a great time out of heroic but it sort of sucks for them they will never see mythic gear
[2:26:24] Sch1ey: But why is that bad?
[2:26:27] NotReallyAdrian: remember Argus? small slope into a cliff PepeLaugh
[2:26:27] Sanctos304: some people really don't like that mythic exists if they can't clear
[2:26:31] freehawk1: Wildstar ICANT
[2:26:31] Squats3: really good
[2:26:33] Xathias: miss that game
[2:26:34] yeyanow: Isn't the difficulty based on how many bosses you can do?
[2:26:34] MorandoTv: GA was such a banger of a raid
[2:26:35] dwolf010: how is it progression if bosses dont get harder?
[2:26:35] Avarizz: maybe im stupid, but the guy who wrote this post is argueing for making the content harder or?
[2:26:37] crucial1711: Why is it danced around the fact that mythic has never been meant for everyone, it's meant for the 2% that actually try to prog it. Is the game not allowed to have challenge? The entire foundation of this argument against mythic difficulty feels entirely off.
[2:26:38] crud_r: US 200-400 is straight misery raiding - what number then do you think is high enough to have 'earned' the right to have a raid on farm for 6-8 weeks instead of grinding balls and locking out for the last 10 weeks every tier? These guilds die constantly to people logging in as a chore after 2/3 4 hour shifts a week for 3 months. @Maximum
[2:26:38] studshift: rip wildstar
[2:26:41] sabaron: i mean bosses are supposed to get harder as you progress, the jumps though are massive towards the end
[2:26:43] studshift: was actlly a decent gam
[2:26:45] CloudyHS: halondrus
[2:26:45] Basic_3: Broodkeeper to Rasz?
[2:26:45] fleks27: first mythic boss easier than heroic last boss has happened SO many times
[2:26:46] Dirtyjim: Miss wildstar
[2:26:46] trevor_sub: sep
[2:26:47] ruzzlestwitch: Tomb
[2:26:48] Ristvakbaen1911: Halondrus?
[2:26:48] walmartpjs: painsmith?
[2:26:48] Swordish__: magmorax being piss easy to echo 😭
[2:26:49] Coolbady: NO
[2:26:49] Greannan: Zorlok ?
[2:26:50] Pariousa: halondrus
[2:26:50] vaniteaDH: sludgefist?
[2:26:50] LysFe: halondrus
[2:26:50] lonelyknight1922: anduin?
[2:26:50] sigabr: Halondrus?
[2:26:50] brewdweard: old naxx
[2:26:51] JERAULT: HFC gorefiend
[2:26:51] thenateo2: halondrus
[2:26:52] MeisterChiefX: eternal palace boss 3 to ashvane
[2:26:52] dralnour: antorus
[2:26:53] not_jhaycen: i was gonna say avatar yeah
[2:26:53] swagggle: Staghelm to Rag
[2:26:54] Ardal_Obe: Anduin?
[2:26:54] Themselves: halondrus xdd
[2:26:54] Morayeden: Prototype anduin
[2:26:55] bjarkanthepoet: Council to Zaqul?
[2:26:56] Atomicrx: lihuvin-halondrus
[2:26:56] lonelycloud7: painsmith
[2:26:56] zubulluu: Painsmith or Holondrus
[2:26:56] thesunnyside: Halondrus
[2:26:57] mortenerenroleplayer123: halondrus?????
[2:26:58] GearzxGaming: Halondrus to whatever you did before it lol
[2:26:58] tharieon: Sludge to slg before netfs.
[2:26:58] Tidget: Halondrus
[2:27:00] Pariousa: anduin
[2:27:00] 發記: skyline 1000 pulls on tindrl
[2:27:01] MeisterChiefX: lihuvim to halondrus
[2:27:03] grozzarr: crabJAM
[2:27:04] skytouch1: can someone explain how thats not working tho?
[2:27:05] crucial1711: Considering tindral could be one of the hardest final bosses ever put in the game if he was one, i would say no.
[2:27:06] lukurjd: diurna into raszageth
[2:27:08] brewdweard: 4 horseman to saph
[2:27:09] TheItalianStallion321: @fleks27 very true
[2:27:09] oonanilord: needs GIGA difficulty only for pros
[2:27:10] jace193: Emerald nightmare? first boss to cenarius?
[2:27:12] The_Boctor: rygelon to jailer
[2:27:13] angrycalf87743: cant kill tindral and fyrak rn before 1k pulls get good
[2:27:14] ruzzlestwitch: Nzoth?
[2:27:19] kdctheman: "quickly"
[2:27:19] Themselves: fuck anduin!
[2:27:19] silent_tv1: are you comparing the version you killed  or the current version?
[2:27:20] zerossussy: garrosh in MoP?
[2:27:22] zerossussy: i think
[2:27:23] bjarkanthepoet: I think council to zaqul was bad
[2:27:23] soccerflow11: Heroic LK still farming people in classic
[2:27:23] Cakerinotv: Still, similar.
[2:27:25] BabyDunn: o yueah any boss into cenarius was rough until it was outgeared
[2:27:26] Greannan: Lithium to Halondrus
[2:27:27] stickchip: Cenarius was rough right
[2:27:29] Crystallize007: it was like week 7 or 8 for halondrus nerfs
[2:27:30] thesunnyside: KT - Sylvanus
[2:27:32] Swordish__: magmorax > echo
[2:27:32] huntercreeper54: so how would you like having the raid on smolderon difficulty max and then achievements pushing it to fyrakk difficulty with no additional loot etc? @Maximum
[2:27:33] Themselves: @Maximum post nerf halondrus into anduin was fucking stupid
[2:27:35] Snydezz: Halondrus was an impossible boss at one point with invisible beams KEKW
[2:27:40] Tereekel: If people want to see mythic content and gear, then they need to get better and pursue that content. Just making it easier because people are sad they don't do the content is a bad take lol
[2:27:51] lavrov5: uunnaat?
[2:27:52] Maruika: just make mythic drop heroic gear
[2:27:58] みょせつ: @Tereekel yeah exactly this
[2:27:59] beels189: @Maximum game is too hard stop making it so hard, but also stop making it so easy so babies can get my gear Kappa
[2:28:00] Morayeden: Add an extra difficulty
[2:28:01] Astrofunkk: ra den
[2:28:06] yeyanow: If you run myt
[2:28:07] Cakerinotv: Time to make a new difficulty
[2:28:09] Nombbs: LFR was nice when i started this season
[2:28:14] JWallace: I’m only still playing the patch today because of mythic raiding being hard. if heroic was the hardest it got I would have stopped playing months ago, how would that be better for wow?
[2:28:14] lmaoerss: as a guy who only does pvp, lfr is nice just to check out the raid.
[2:28:14] crud_r: US 200-400 is straight misery raiding - what number then do you think is high enough to have 'earned' the right to have a raid on farm for 6-8 weeks instead of grinding balls and locking out for the last 10 weeks every tier? These guilds die constantly to people logging in as a chore after 2/3 4 hour shifts a week for 3 months. Been in a dozen 2-3 night CE guilds in this range that always stall on the last two, also compounded because you get just as many upgrades from M+vault  @Maximum
[2:28:16] nayrcraig: What do you mean? There are a huge number of people who enjoy Heroic and would be bored by normal
[2:28:19] lavrov5: remember uunat?
[2:28:19] hotmanpop: @Maruika yep, just make it drop different cosmetic, like for pvp high rating
[2:28:20] Coolbady: @Tereekel SeemsGood
[2:28:28] zenkodac: lfr allows a lot of people to interact with raids so it doesn't mess with my own experience
[2:28:28] Zlynnt: I don't know if Asmon actually cares about the content difficulty as much as he cares about his ability to get BiS
[2:28:34] JonatanXaD: @kheim how come a dk can tank it 100% uptime and the moment we not have that class the difficulty steps up 2x ? And we're not wiping to tanks, the whole fight is insanely difficult for a second to last boss, no room to micro manage mistakes is trash
[2:28:37] ungnyaa: The real title of this video should be "I'm washed up and I'm pissed"
[2:28:51] zenkodac: more the first 3 the next 3 and the last 2 are clearly on diffrent levels
[2:28:51] PPowzer74: KEKW
[2:28:52] aithran: Dentge
[2:28:53] ErikJugend: SURELY
[2:28:54] spivet: full on ignored the person who was talking about BT lol
[2:28:55] Peber555: xdd
[2:28:55] yeahp0n: naxx gear was good until kara
[2:28:57] zenkodac: thats super revisionist
[2:28:59] spiritcheese: xdd
[2:28:59] imsorrykk: that;s not true lol we just couldnt
[2:28:59] Spartany25: whats the diffrence?
[2:29:00] Qubuuuu: xdding
[2:29:01] brewdweard: The game was not great back than
[2:29:01] Peber555: ben said bla
[2:29:02] klamonte: hardest cope take ever
[2:29:03] lathander557: No one knew bc was going to eradicate all gear immediately back then
[2:29:04] NotReallyAdrian: xdd invalidate dn
[2:29:04] BigTrout3: xdd
[2:29:04] Badd_Boi: still complaining about tbc in 2024
[2:29:05] sabaron: that is absolutely NOT why wtf
[2:29:06] 94explorer: game was great back then cause everyone was a fuckin moron (me especially)
[2:29:06] Tachygraphy: move those goalposts asmon KEKW
[2:29:08] tobbs94: bro people didnt thinkj that far ahead back then
[2:29:08] PPowzer74: yea because people thought about that back then KEKW
[2:29:08] CloudyHS: thats just revisionist history
[2:29:09] Protoman_702: this is wrong most guilds were stuck aq40 because you still had to farm bwl and mc it was too time consuming to that and prog 2 raids
[2:29:09] Themselves: what does this have to do with BT
[2:29:10] maplelost: it was too hard bro
[2:29:12] brewdweard: it was "great" but not to modern standards
[2:29:12] zenkodac: they didnt play naxx because they didnt even know it existed
[2:29:14] yeahp0n: naxx gear was literally BIS until 70 in the next raid LMAO
[2:29:14] avenira_qt: he said the opposite last week i wouldnt worry about it KEKW
[2:29:19] Jelzo__: stop laying just to make ur ilvl a bigger number?
[2:29:19] Razzin_: thats not the reason
[2:29:20] nanerpus_: can you imagine if they did an expansion and you didnt get better gear? Holy shit
[2:29:21] codydoubleu: xdd playing game invalidates future playing of game
[2:29:22] nayrcraig: How is gear not artifical?
[2:29:25] freehawk1: What is he even saying
[2:29:27] Lothland: that is not why Naxx wasn’t cleared what a stupid revisionist take lol
[2:29:28] aithran: it's a GAME, everything in it is artificial
[2:29:29] SirScizor2020: Thats not true, people didnt do Naxx because it was hard and the bosses had mechanics
[2:29:30] ashla11: classic enjoyers always say they dont like their gear replaced
[2:29:30] yeyanow: If you did mythic abberrus you don't have any reason to do lfr so I don't understand the point
[2:29:30] huntercreeper54: at this rate just stop playing the game cause your gear will be eventually replaced at some point
[2:29:30] nayrcraig: Gear doesn't grow outta the ground bro
[2:29:31] ShowDUH: HUH
[2:29:31] vynistrian: hes just speaking gibberish lmao, absolutely making stuff up
[2:29:33] Cakerinotv: @maximum is getting gear week after week not artificial?
[2:29:33] HeffaBear: huh
[2:29:33] NotD4k: what
[2:29:33] GearzxGaming: HUH
[2:29:34] Spartany25: So designed content should just sit there unplayed??
[2:29:34] andaroo: so should we not change classes during a patch for the same reason? What's he arguing?
[2:29:35] berchberkins: why not though
[2:29:36] Taytor: guy spent the last 20 minutes saying that "shit shouldn't be so hard"
[2:29:36] Arcinatos: what is blud saying
[2:29:37] Morayeden: Yes
[2:29:37] meozart: what?
[2:29:38] ICitizenErasedI: tbf i think naxx gear was relevant a fair way through BC
[2:29:38] belfastcl: naxx was pretty hard for its time
[2:29:40] eyxx: xdd
[2:29:40] NotReallyAdrian: YEP
[2:29:40] DeandreT: isn't that what gear is???
[2:29:41] kilkott: naxx gear was fucking nuts what is he talking about
[2:29:42] enigmasvea: Asmon takes HAH
[2:29:43] Austrian: YEP
[2:29:43] Osterberg501: People didn't raid naxx because you had to progress through all the other raids, and still be good. This is what keeping everything "relevant" does.
[2:29:44] MooHamOinkBeef: What an insane take lol
[2:29:46] ungnyaa: Asmongold was saying hc aberrus was too hard and had too many mechanics
[2:29:46] spiritcheese: YEP
[2:29:47] sabaron: but gearing nerfs bosses
[2:29:48] ErikJugend: I think Blizz want to be perfect too lmao
[2:29:48] BabyDunn: hes the karen of the gaming world
[2:29:49] tobbs94: 4Head
[2:29:51] wellyg: he just wants it to be easy so everyone can do it lmao doesnt want anything hard and complicated
[2:29:53] manlyhandles: this is literally the JB take OMEGALUL
[2:29:55] BathingBear: I hate getting reset every patch, but that's mostly catch up mechanics
[2:29:56] abiduel: bc he's a dumbass
[2:29:56] Lenietwitch: i dont understand the take of "no tunning" WE PLAY LIVE GAMES, is not a solo RPG, asmon is just dumb
[2:29:57] donutboyj: just stop tuning every mythic raid for ONLY 2 guilds,
[2:29:58] huntercreeper54: just get good YEP
[2:29:59] lastericalive: people didn’t do naxx because it was hard. had nothing to do with tbc
[2:30:00] Stephy_Mariee: literally
[2:30:02] kosburger: @Maximum you should get asmon on stream and discuss it
[2:30:02] nellfin: he just want less people to play the game essentially
[2:30:02] BigTrout3: he's bean saying "just be perfect"
[2:30:03] zenkodac: gg take, "you now what this game would be great if everything was perfect about it" genius level take
[2:30:05] oonanilord: should make raids mystic+     like 1 2 3 4 5
[2:30:05] Tooyoo: He's complaining for the sake of complaining
[2:30:05] kheim: Basically just get it right Blizzard, u fucks
[2:30:05] Genkar85: keep in mind he tried to do sire heroic day 1 and quit cause it was too hard
[2:30:06] berchberkins: if you want more people to clear it later they have to nerf it right? or else its just piss easy for half of the game
[2:30:07] vairochad: Asmongold, the man who has never been wrong.....
[2:30:07] Azikielboi: he means tbc/classic style gear prog, rather than modern seasonal catchup @Maximum
[2:30:15] yeyanow: Because nerfing is "unnatural" apparently
[2:30:17] talkley: yeah this is always what an asmon take is KEKW
[2:30:17] crucial1711: Naxx gear was viable all the way through Karazhan what
[2:30:19] Starforkx: wait, so only the top 1% is able to see all content? that's what im getting from that take lmao
[2:30:24] i_cassius: i_cassius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:30:25] dundlen: if they never nerfed bosses, the number of clears of all difficulties would drop a lot
[2:30:30] Themselves: nothing
[2:30:31] Azikielboi: he isnt talking about nerfs there, he is talking about gear catchuo systems
[2:30:37] RestLyss: i thought people didnt do Naxx cause it was hard??
[2:30:40] Badd_Boi: @yeyanow god hates nerfs
[2:30:41] ungnyaa: Does it matter if world 1000 plebs have an easier time
[2:30:42] Coolbady: @Maximum Btw ItemLevel Difference is 6 from Heroic to Mythic when you max upgrade them
[2:30:44] BobAwesome: Asmon knows how to get things perfectly right the first time, just look at his PC company Starforged. They've never had ANY issues at all.
[2:30:45] Quiznuhtodd: @donutboyj It doesn't. If you can't kill mythic bosses, maybe do heroic?
[2:30:47] Clindo_: because wow is the only game that has ever nerfed anything KEKW
[2:30:52] darkgigaz: Sorry got here late, how was Dune 2?
[2:30:53] daevyfan: ketchup system
[2:30:59] bobtari: welfare epics
[2:30:59] Smitez: Do you think there could be a way blizz just gives the top handful of guilds access to the raid with scaled ilvl just for the rwf and not have to do splits or would that just be seen as "unfair" to the rest of top 100 guilds
[2:31:00] Azikielboi: m+ ilvl gets higher each patch yeah
[2:31:00] crud_r: Pretending they don't nerf the last 2-3 bosses like a dozen+ times each tier is disingenuous as hell.
[2:31:00] Gorakk82: all the greens in ED
[2:31:04] aithran: free tier in your mailbox every week Kappa
[2:31:04] Azikielboi: or that yeah
[2:31:05] Gorakk82: its too much
[2:31:06] trickyshot_: like super blooms give catch up
[2:31:06] huntercreeper54: m+ getting upgrade ilvl from patch to patch
[2:31:07] BabyDunn: flightstones/crests having the cap go up weekly
[2:31:07] spivet: @darkgigaz 0/10 no popcorn bucket
[2:31:07] the_great_simonator: yep
[2:31:07] ItchY_val: yeah
[2:31:07] burlin_: catch up system are good though...
[2:31:08] PuzzleMonkey: 424 gear
[2:31:08] Gutshots: timeless isles
[2:31:13] crucial1711: Why is it bad to have a difficulty mode that is meant for the top 1%? 95% of the playerbase never even goes into mythic because they don't care to. Heroic is enough of a challenge. So why does he talk like mythic difficulty applies to everybody and is some huge issue.
[2:31:14] Themselves: yea but u just take ur alts straight into m+ so why does it matter
[2:31:14] BigTrout3: no he said he didn't want any catch-up gear
[2:31:15] Azikielboi: he doesnt like seasonal model yeah
[2:31:17] MattOogle: You get a pack of gear yeah
[2:31:21] daevyfan: ketchup gear
[2:31:21] Kevmoeman: because if youre stuck on  a boss you just wait for it to be nerfed?
[2:31:26] dwolf010: I mean the catch up gear is lfr normal level
[2:31:26] c10starburst: why not make mythic cosmetic and not ilvl rewards.  they can make it hard as they want. kinda like a challenge mode thing. so you can get bis ilvl gear from heroic and do mythic for the status of being a hardcore raider.
[2:31:27] Themselves: like fresh alts go straight into m+ and get gear who gives a fuck about catch up gear?
[2:31:30] zenkodac: but you can totally do that, you can go into normal and do fine with last patches gears
[2:31:35] PleaseLessen: wow is seasonal now, classic exists if people want the old system
[2:31:37] BrandonAUS: Personally current method of gearing as a heroic/first few mythic boss raider, it's fine as is
[2:31:37] Azikielboi: right he is talking about disliking seasonal model, it makes raids easier over time @Maximum
[2:31:38] zannuss: what about mustard gear?
[2:31:40] NotD4k: posture check
[2:31:43] kooshi559: no he meant why raiding during p2 when p2 gears is going to get replace by p3 egars..
[2:31:45] valarbravoosi: remember farming previous raid to get into current raids back in like... MoP?
[2:31:46] EasyBreezier: It also helps alts for people
[2:31:48] Piki9: Yeah, he thinks your gearing should come only from previous raids @maximum so makes new players do those raids
[2:31:49] Coolbady: @Maximum Btw ItemLevel Difference is 6 from Heroic to Mythic when you max upgrade them
[2:31:52] manlyhandles: moon2GUNCH
[2:31:52] spiritcheese: @Kevmoeman thats not how it works
[2:31:52] dundlen: catchup gear makes more people play the game
[2:31:52] Crocos: not eve mentioning working on alts and you have no way to catch up
[2:31:53] lonelycloud7: remove splits and make mythic gear cosmetic
[2:31:54] nayrcraig: @Themselves This is not true, you need the catchup gear for M+
[2:31:55] Wikedlyrics: @PleaseLessen classic is seasonal now
[2:31:56] Slapsstick: as someone who doesnt like raiding I just play M+ and pug normal and heroic YEP
[2:31:59] BabyDunn: i just heard my back crack. shit
[2:32:01] baddecisiondanx: @crucial1711 no one thinks it's bad to have that mode. people think it sucks that 99% of the player base will never be able to have bis gear
[2:32:02] Themselves: nayrcraig that is not true
[2:32:02] Jarlan23: never im gonna stay leaned b ack in my chair
[2:32:04] Diazanite: currently postured like a boiled shrimp next question
[2:32:04] Azikielboi: YEP
[2:32:07] ThebluesBilly: they added catchup gear on wrath classic and everybody loved it @Maximum
[2:32:08] timmayb166: you know how long it’d take to catch up if you have to every raid late in the expansion what about alts lol
[2:32:10] Cakerinotv: thats just not how the game works
[2:32:13] malavander: also less of a hurdle to sync up with your friends who may be ahead
[2:32:13] daoCZ: anyone else pooping?
[2:32:14] Cakerinotv: at this point
[2:32:14] gankeds: yo wait fated just fixes that issue then
[2:32:17] nanerpus_: thats horrible for like 80 % of the audience
[2:32:21] Piki9: KEKW
[2:32:21] TheSHAYdynasty: lost ark does that, and fuck that
[2:32:23] Cakerinotv: @daoCZ just finished pooping
[2:32:23] yeahp0n: classic wow did catchup raids.. they were called 20 mans
[2:32:24] mute_tron: than noone gets a raind spot
[2:32:26] ErikJugend: I did it in classic and it fucking sucked ass
[2:32:26] Lothland: they hated that in BC it’s why it changed
[2:32:26] CloudyHS: OMEGALUL
[2:32:28] Basic_3: We have to farm you up a Grieftorch dawg
[2:32:28] iPsyop: they had catch up gear even in WoTLK @Maximum with badges of valor/honor
[2:32:28] donutboyj: @Quiznuhtodd they are tuning it for 2 guilds, even theose 2 need nerfs to kill them as they are tuned on release. nerfing bosses to let more guilds kill bosses is just shit design
[2:32:29] Azikielboi: KEKW yeah thats the counter argument
[2:32:31] dwolf010: thats fucking awfull lol
[2:32:32] iminshayne: current crests feels that way too tho
[2:32:33] spivet: yeah I would fucking hate that shit lol, would never be able to get friends back in
[2:32:33] Yosty: skipppppp
[2:32:33] みょせつ: those people should go play classic
[2:32:34] BigTrout3: MAJORW take
[2:32:35] timmayb166: that takes wayyyyy too much time
[2:32:35] zenkodac: imagine having to do vault now just to do teldrassil
[2:32:36] omgwatlol: most of these things changed in wow because people love their alts, there's no going back lmao
[2:32:36] Morayeden: 0% I would ever play
[2:32:36] codydoubleu: ICANT "need 4 healers for Raszageth"
[2:32:36] fleks27: people hated going back for mixing sets in legion so they killed 6 piece sets
[2:32:38] HarmlessCurse: TBC
[2:32:38] Ghetolay: I think what he is talking about on tuning is that this tuning is planned. Boos hard planned to be nerfed/tuned down from the start
[2:32:40] Tzames: why cant both catch up systems operate though @Maximum
[2:32:40] JERAULT: i wouldnt have returned to WoW season 3 if that was the case
[2:32:41] Avarizz: i used to hate that lol
[2:32:41] Azikielboi: anyone in this discussion who says the other side is "wrong" is stupid, its just 2 different stlyes
[2:32:41] rottisxd: luckily wotlk is great. just jump in icc gdkp
[2:32:41] Peber555: that's not how gaming works now
[2:32:42] caveman2x: i would unsub
[2:32:42] Azikielboi: pros and cons
[2:32:42] celimas: celimas subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! I've hardly played retail in the last year, but still love the content, keep it up
[2:32:42] fzybny: I would quit instantly like I did back then.
[2:32:44] walmartpjs: more reasons to buy carries in current content so you dont have to do old YEP
[2:32:46] jesuslouise: now that classic is popular, i think it makes even more sense to lean into 'retail' design
[2:32:46] kattyls: yeah that was trash
[2:32:47] warpless: attunement gear lol
[2:32:47] lastericalive: in vanilla you would carry people in higher raids and feed them fear (welfare epics)
[2:32:48] Aro725: I just like being rewarded for playing the whole time. Instead of someone just getting the same ilvl for free. I know its beneficial but the selfish part of me doesnt like it
[2:32:48] Austrian: yeah i wouldnt like that
[2:32:48] Bomaz: That was how classic worked
[2:32:49] dogsenses: what do you mean relevant? to a new guy ANY raid content is relevant
[2:32:50] bilboswaginzz305: It's a thing in destiny and i can tell you it's not well recieved from the fan base
[2:32:50] Archmage_Michael: I would love to play an alt now but the thought of farming all these crest ...
[2:32:51] Oblag: that sounds awful. i just started in DF 10.2. how would i even find groups to get me multiple tiers of gear
[2:32:51] Greannan: Some guilds were stuck with people leaving all the time for the next "tier"of guilds
[2:32:53] crucial1711: @baddecisiondanx why does that matter if you're never doing the content that requires it? You can get equivalent gear within 1-2% from M+
[2:32:54] Lenietwitch: yes, it uise to be like that, if you start WOTRLK in ICC you had to farm eveyrthing xD
[2:32:54] yeyanow: That's a pretty horrible system. Just run regular dungeon and it's a mix of people who know nothing and people speedrunning them. It's awful.
[2:32:54] jesterpots: wow OLD head wanting the game to be what it was
[2:32:55] NoneLikeTrynd: @Maximum just getting back into the game now is impossible takes weeks to get my buddy geared imagine having to progress 3 raids first
[2:32:55] huntercreeper54: nah sorry man you gotta come back in a year when expansion release right now you'd be a pain
[2:32:57] glacialspiker: yes we had to bring new recruits to ssc and tk to get them ready for black temple
[2:32:57] bjarkanthepoet: @Maximum imagine gearing alts like that to play the new raid
[2:32:57] Probab1e: Especially if you have a population problem, further splitting the player base is something blizz hates
[2:32:57] CloudyHS: HAH professional
[2:32:57] AgentAntwan: Imagine trying to keep up with alts
[2:32:58] Alienjuggernaut: it's like BFA having to farm essences and neck level to play ny'alotha
[2:32:59] timmayb166: @walmartpjs facts
[2:32:59] Doenos: if you wanna play with a new guy, you have to carry them through new content.. thats how it used to be. they feel useless for weeks :)
[2:33:00] nayrcraig: @Themselves The gear level for +5 goes up each season, you can go into it with M0 gear
[2:33:00] The_Boctor: i mean tbh at this point you just drag their dead corpse across the finish line until you have gear
[2:33:02] Klacksaft: how does that even work with m+ being a thing?
[2:33:03] zenkodac: i would insta quit if i had to farm 3 raids per reset
[2:33:04] Razzin_: 20 mans in classic were used as catch up mechanisms
[2:33:05] Goodvin: catchup gear should exist only for last patch of addon
[2:33:08] Piki9: As a "dad" gamer, prefer the seasonal model @maximum
[2:33:10] dopamine360: why u cant be a new player in wrath currently. you need to do the old raids to do current stuff but no one is doing the old raids.
[2:33:13] crud_r: @Maximum Mid CE guilds never get the seasonal letdown though- they grind, raid 2-3 a week, lockout for the last 2 months, and rarely even ever rekill a boss. There's so little enjoyment by the end of most tiers, it's more just relief it's over. They never get the BiS gear nut.
[2:33:14] raizoontv: it’s so interesting people including asmon were complaining about how you cannot play alts before DF and now he complains that catchup gear is a thing maximumPre @maximum
[2:33:15] BobAwesome: Catch Up gear has been around since TBC
[2:33:26] meozart: @maximum he wants content raids so he can pug day one and move on
[2:33:28] Ristvakbaen1911: Until 11.0
[2:33:29] Avulsionn: cross realm is next xpac right
[2:33:29] Clevelandmk: still no date for a4?
[2:33:31] Gorakk82: CR changes in WW
[2:33:31] ashelfal: Cross realm is gone next expansion at least
[2:33:32] ungnyaa: Asmongold just has a withered brain and wants to turn retail into classic cause he's gotten too slow to do any difficult content but he still wanna play 18 hours a day
[2:33:33] ThebluesBilly: @Lenietwitch that's why they added catch gear on wrath classic
[2:33:35] Piki9: Mythic Raid ID needs to go @maximum
[2:33:37] Clevelandmk: still no date for s4?*
[2:33:38] traisc: cross realm will be available from the start in TWW
[2:33:38] EasyBreezier: Oh yeah it feels so bad when the one mage/DH/whatever is gone on some random given day and now you suddenly don't have that buff
[2:33:38] BabyDunn: yeah the cross realm thing fucks my dad guild
[2:33:40] Aro725: @dopamine360 Nah not true at all. You can literally do dungeons for all 245 gear from togc. Bought from a vendor
[2:33:40] Silencbank: well cross realm is no more, if next season is fated
[2:33:43] Gorakk82: hopefully helps
[2:33:45] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx bis gear for what though? Why does someone who isn't pushing mythic raids or m+ need the best gear? They want it because it exists and it's cool? Then if they want it they need to do what it takes to get good enough to get it lol
[2:33:49] Sulm: I feel like Mythic should become flex whenever the hall of fame fills up
[2:33:54] zenkodac: fingers crossed
[2:34:04] crud_r: @Tereekel Because it's a RPG and people want cool shit on their character lol
[2:34:08] baddecisiondanx: @crucial1711 because you build a max'd gear set for 1% of players, and btw the average aotc player is complete trash. they are not getting max'd out gear from m+
[2:34:10] ThisIsAsabel: Every game is super restrictive in choices the harder and better you want to be, it's natural. You simply need to pick the best options
[2:34:15] HumanityDH: any system that restricts players from playing the game with their friends when ever they want. is a bad system
[2:34:18] crud_r: Don't talk like that's a foreign ass concept.
[2:34:23] andaroo: @Tereekel agree, they even have taken the Mythic transmogs and made them fairly obtainable oto anybody who can do 16+ M+
[2:34:41] Tereekel: @crud_r  then get better at the game and pursue it lol
[2:34:44] crucial1711: @baddecisiondanx it's literally just numbers, they arent't crafting new custom made item sets, they just tune the numbers up 5% and now you have your BiS gear. Your argument is lost on me.
[2:34:48] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel intentionally ignorant i guess. or you've never played any other mmo in existence
[2:34:56] yeyanow: I mean, anyone aiming for top 100 is generally going optimize the fk out the game
[2:35:01] elblasto: @Aro725 ah yes, the boring ass heroic+ that you need to do like 60 of them to be in equal terms as just raiding, and you gotta do professions too if you want more player power
[2:35:01] ungnyaa: M+ shouldn't give mythic gear in 18s that's the downfall of mythic raiding
[2:35:06] VehxD: ELE SHAMAN BUTTON WHEN?
[2:35:07] crud_r: @Tereekel You asked why, the reason why isn't to run a key 1 level higher, they want the best shit because it's the best.
[2:35:08] Basic_3: and they were all DKs before you killed them
[2:35:12] Lyonidus: raid buffs are bad, change my mind
[2:35:13] ThisIsAsabel: ppl may need to realize the difference between super hard competitive content for tryhards, from regular "i want to play with my firends" shit
[2:35:15] huntercreeper54: yeah the buff era is absurd
[2:35:23] vialttv: @ungnyaa Wiat but it doesnt lol
[2:35:26] Clindo_: @crud_r then get better
[2:35:30] funnybunny_hs: who did you kick for tobo
[2:35:33] baddecisiondanx: @crucial1711 i'm just telling you exactly what it is. whether you agree with it or not is up to you. but that doesn't make it illigitimate. people for the entirety of wow have chased bis gear. and 99% of the community will never see it. i could care less. but it's the truth
[2:35:38] maplelost: i heard liquid stole tobo gg
[2:35:38] caveman2x: no raid buffs
[2:35:39] alarkin: Venruki had the best TL:DR on your podcast - Mythic is too hard. It sure is, it should not be a complicated debate, just reign it in, make the mode more accessible to more people, win win win. Fights like initial Tindral and Fyrakk need to vanish.
[2:35:39] caveman2x: all skill
[2:35:43] Lorrdzik: @ungnyaa Before m+ gave that, mythic raiding was already not popular at all
[2:35:44] Missingiscool: bring the player not the class. nvm need 16 slots for buffs
[2:35:51] spiritcheese: @ungnyaa it gives heroic gear. not myth. just the item in the weeky chest . so whatever
[2:35:53] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx you're asking to change core wow from how it's always been because you don't want to take the time to get the good items
[2:35:56] Kerkem: @Maximum What is your thought on bringing the buff scrolls back?
[2:35:57] raeza444: idk maybe take wotlk approach where many classes and specs share the same buff
[2:35:58] ICitizenErasedI: he got bored reading that :p
[2:35:58] sabaron: he doesnt even know what a raid buff is, jesus
[2:36:02] ComicsWoW: doesnt know anything cause he doesnt play the game KEKW
[2:36:03] crud_r: @Clindo_ I mean sure, I've been bis'd ever y tier for the last 15, I'm just saying why other people want it
[2:36:06] 94explorer: this is supatease's post? lmao
[2:36:07] Tereekel: @crud_r then get better and get the gear lol
[2:36:08] aithran: Dentge
[2:36:10] CloudyHS: ?
[2:36:13] Gutshots: but it was ok then because asmon played then
[2:36:17] VehxD: who cares about nerfs i just like raiding with the buds
[2:36:18] Destrolisher: AINTNOWAY tbc
[2:36:20] Sathenus: bAcK iN mY dAy
[2:36:21] crud_r: @crud_r I also want it because it's the best, I could give a fuck about another key level.
[2:36:21] texazbandit: you got the mythic plus gate keepers too lol
[2:36:23] SniggleJake572: wrong, they nerfed the hell out of BT
[2:36:23] yooz111: Didn't they do a flat 20% or 25%  nerf?
[2:36:26] muffe100: Nerfs in TBC were fine but not in retail?
[2:36:27] huntercreeper54: @Missingiscool bring the player from the class you need, easy fix KEKW
[2:36:29] crucial1711: @baddecisiondanx people who are trying to push hard content have chased gear, people who don't care about it, don't chase gear like that. People saying "game too hard" beyond heroic just need to get better or accept they aren't good enough but let the challenge stay.
[2:36:30] ncorgi: why mofos still bring shit like burning crusade up all the time
[2:36:31] infraredpen: @94explorer nah. supa must be in his chat or something
[2:36:31] vtech310: he bends reality to fit his communication. hes ok sometimes but not the times he cherry picks
[2:36:32] bananafarmer2: @Maximum wasn't everyone complaining about class stacking (because no raid buffs or not bringing enough to a comp) so they gave almost everyone a raid buff and now they complain about that too??
[2:36:33] CloudyHS: @Gutshots OLD WOW GOOD NEW WOW BAD Madge
[2:36:35] Diazanite: @alarkin too hard for who? how are we quantifying hard? pull count? how long it takes the average guild to clear?
[2:36:39] itsjalin: Killer perm max!
[2:36:45] 94explorer: @infraredpen was gonna say, homie doesnt even pve KEKW
[2:36:50] Tachygraphy: dead pov
[2:36:50] andaroo: what does this have to do with anything
[2:36:54] CloudyHS: what is he talking about
[2:36:54] nanerpus_: ???
[2:36:58] sorliee: Asmon is living in the past man
[2:36:59] zenkodac: what is he talking about ? vash was nerfed mid patch as was kael'thas, and those fights were mega broken
[2:37:02] Sathenus: yes powercreep exhists
[2:37:03] nayrcraig: Why is he ignoring the nerfs and talkijng about talents?
[2:37:03] Tereekel: @crud_r the best gear, coolest transmog, whatever Chase content there is will always be unattainable by people who just want it to have it but don't want to work for it
[2:37:04] Tidget: Well yeah.....
[2:37:05] avenira_qt: what
[2:37:08] Lindorn_: it was like 30% nerf on the whole raid
[2:37:10] funnybunny_hs: whom did you kick for tobo
[2:37:11] nanerpus_: So his take is that old expansion raids were easier with new expansion stuff?
[2:37:13] ThebluesBilly: why is he talking about pre-patch wrath LUL
[2:37:14] crucial1711: Max close your mouth, your critical thinking is showing.
[2:37:14] Qubuuuu: xddShrug
[2:37:14] renarton: cope
[2:37:17] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel i'm not asking to change anything. you don't even understand the base argument of this entire topic. this is not the base of how wow has always been. you know many completely  grey parsers were able to get bis classic through following expansions?  i'm not saying it's the right direction to go with the game. but you're completely wrong about how the game was...
[2:37:18] ayoSwis: He keeps comparing a game from 20 years ago. Im confused lol
[2:37:21] huntercreeper54: yapping
[2:37:22] dobi_gg: he skips that whole comp section @Maximum
[2:37:24] CloudyHS: ???????? COPIUM
[2:37:26] Yosty: whats he yapping about
[2:37:26] ungnyaa: guess what after weeks of vaults people have full mythic gear doing 18s and they're not incentived to do mythic at all , plus any shitter getting the same gear as the most difficult content is just a bad concept
[2:37:27] Crystallize007: 1100 -> 3000 = 30% increase NOTED
[2:37:27] talkley: konazbLoading
[2:37:27] stenpotatis: i dont get it
[2:37:28] Austrian: huh

[2:37:35] Piki9: Buff scrolls, Ultimates and no Raid ID lockouts, biggest fixes @maximum
[2:37:36] ectocantaim: what is going on?
[2:37:39] waelrick: 40 man ICANT
[2:37:40] ItsNoyzTv: @Niconatelver BASED
[2:37:40] zenkodac: he's talking about classic tbc or original tbc?
[2:37:41] sabaron: a nerf is a nerf
[2:37:43] iamthegodcomplex: They were explicitly nerfed to make them easier, blizz said it
[2:37:47] acee_______: @Crystallize007 u dont get the point of it or wat

[2:37:48] NotD4k: CAUGHT

[2:37:55] SniggleJake572: there was so much dead weight in 40man raids in OG vanilla WoW
[2:37:56] BigTrout3: because it would kill the game........
[2:37:56] Yosty: Worst take
[2:37:56] fzybny: Killed Wildstar
[2:37:56] traisc: game's too dead for that tbh
[2:37:57] JERAULT: 'my most unpopular wow opinion' yeah maybe cause its dogshit bud
[2:37:57] Line_0: 40 man is impossible to sustain

[2:38:01] ElderSeas: His points don't even hold true. If he liked wrath why doesn't he play it it's out literally right now. He doesn't actually like it
[2:38:01] ErikJugend: People are complaining about 20 man rn lmao
[2:38:01] abiduel: he's just braindead

[2:38:10] Sulm: Everyone's computer would explode from raiding
[2:38:10] ErikJugend: You would still class stack
[2:38:10] Clindo_: and more trouble in forming a raid LUL
[2:38:11] Sathenus: THATS THE ONLY REASON HE HAS FOR 40 MAN!?
[2:38:11] Teeemosh: THANKS THD FOR WORDS OF WISDOM
[2:38:11] Starforkx: @Crystallize007 that's what i got on my quackulator too
[2:38:11] higoo__: nah hes gotta be joking w that take. its 2024 bro, 40 man raids straight up are unviable
[2:38:11] foobis_25: 40 man tindral KEKW
[2:38:11] WolfgangAmpersand: Hes so out of it...
[2:38:12] Yosty: But EVERYTHING else is bad xdd
[2:38:12] Austrian: actually crazy take
[2:38:12] hi_im_sant: wtf
[2:38:13] reggiepowa: I don't think it's the most unpopular, I hate his reset opinion more
[2:38:13] direbeest: that is the take of a man who does not play world of warcraft
[2:38:13] glorkwimp: dogshittiest take
[2:38:14] Wildfire_Gaming: its hard for us to keep a 20 man roster TrollDespair
[2:38:14] waelrick: raid buffs Madge
[2:38:14] Spartany25: theres no synergy in his takes man, so confused
[2:38:14] Qwasty: High copium asmon

[2:38:14] brainrot_behavior: but way more trouble keeping a team LMAO
[2:38:14] Scriix: my man hasnt tried to wrangle 40 people in wow in HOW LONG?
[2:38:15] Azikielboi: ddx HE IS RIGHT
[2:38:15] nayrcraig: You would have 0 trouble cause you would never raid :)
[2:38:15] Diazanite: god what an insanely bad take
[2:38:16] Kemplore: get rid of buffs
[2:38:16] PleaseLessen: mid mythic guilds can't even maintain 20 people KEKW
[2:38:16] talkley: @Azikielboi yes he is
[2:38:16] Diazanite: good lord
[2:38:17] alrightmeow: Asmon has been too high on his own supply for too long, and now he things he is always right
[2:38:18] stenpotatis: bro at this point he must be just farming the old doomers? THERE IS NO WAY HE IS THIS DUMB
[2:38:19] elirank9: Ppl want 8 player raid and he says 40
[2:38:19] Azikielboi: xdd
[2:38:19] renarton: our guilds officer would kill themselves if they had to recruit for 40
[2:38:19] ThoseCrazyGuys: Technically the truth KEKW
[2:38:19] vmaster11: GIVE ME 40 MAN RAIDS BACK
[2:38:20] bananafarmer2: @Maximum wasn't everyone complaining about class stacking (because no raid buffs or not bringing enough to a comp) so they gave almost everyone a raid buff and now they complain about that too?? 󠀀
[2:38:20] Halt57: so no smaller guilds can raid anymore
[2:38:20] BlayzeRM: dumb fucking take
[2:38:20] ShadowBites: He has ZERO IDEA on how hard guild management is. Managing 20+ people is insane much less 40
[2:38:22] nanerpus_: wild take from someone who hasnt meaningfully interacted with the game in multiple expansions
[2:38:22] Faraday5001: YOU HAAVE LIKE 20 WARRIORS IN 40 MAN CLASSIC NAXX WHAT IS THIS COOK
[2:38:22] PrimeTimeRime: overcooked take
[2:38:22] Missingiscool: hunter pets used to fill any raid buff you needed
[2:38:23] noirlol: ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT
[2:38:24] Mtkx11: truueeee
[2:38:24] SpaEngi: 40 man tindral WAYTOODANK
[2:38:24] JakeTehBear: 40 man raiding is 10 man raiding with 30 complete brainless idiots
[2:38:26] pryll_: i'd prefer 45 man
[2:38:26] Scriix: 20 is giga hard now
[2:38:26] Avarizz: but you can do 40 man HC right now??? so what is the problem again??
[2:38:26] infraredpen: who cares about raid composition if you can't get enough people to raid at all. Big brain
[2:38:27] texas_grizzly: 40 man SCATTER
[2:38:27] burlin_: He isn't wrong but instead of a comp problem you would just never get 40
[2:38:27] Niconatelver: give us 10 man mythic raiding
[2:38:28] c10starburst: 5 man raids inc
[2:38:29] eyeztea: remove aug and game is great
[2:38:29] BigTrout3: you can kill the spider in your house by setting your house on fire Clueless
[2:38:30] migilicuty: didn't he just have a take that said its impossible to get a raid together?
[2:38:30] Arcinatos: I wish i could spit as confidently as asmon
[2:38:31] Swordish__: yes double the chance for 1 shot mechanics to kill you for a single person fucking up in a 20 man
[2:38:31] JERAULT: my raid tonight is cancelled because getting 20 people together is hard
[2:38:31] dundlen: @maximum 40 mans would kill the game. not to super doom, but they added the flex raiding thing for a reason...
[2:38:31] Austrian: 20 is alot
[2:38:32] vmaster11: give me 40s
[2:38:32] ungnyaa: You should close the video at this point he's just objectively out of touch
[2:38:32] yeahp0n: I already think SOD is dreading 40 mans coming back. And were classic andys LOL
[2:38:33] andaroo: then they'd design raids for 40 man and still have to nerf it after Echo/Liquid were done with it PepeLaugh
[2:38:33] ItchY_val: getting 40 ppl aint no way
[2:38:35] thenateo2: 40 man tindral with 35 seeds
[2:38:35] cmnights: its 2027 now
[2:38:35] alarkin: @Diazanite Wow is a seasonal game. The season end in the first few months for a few hundred guilds, it doesn't end at all for 1000s of others, whose only shot at clearing is to extend. Wow didn't used to be a seasonal game, so this latter event didn't used to be an issue, it is now. The mode should be clearable, as seasonal content, in a reasonable frame, by more people.
[2:38:36] baddecisiondanx: 40 man is trash
[2:38:37] zenkodac: its hard getting 20 people , whats the fix? asmon: get 40
[2:38:37] noirlol: 40 ICANT
[2:38:37] EasyBreezier: 40 man is just the most cooked take ever
[2:38:38] gouryella1898: 40 man tindral would literally light peoples computers on fire KEKW
[2:38:38] WolfgangAmpersand: Just take classic and even there people have specific setup for 40 man raid.
[2:38:39] BlayzeRM: you should decrease player count not increase kekw
[2:38:39] foobis_25: 40 man tindral TrollDespair
[2:38:39] yeyanow: We can barely get 12 people :/
[2:38:39] mocha447_: Imagine trying to find 40 people for a mythic raid goodluck LOL
[2:38:39] wildsa79: Guilds cant even get 20 ppl together
[2:38:39] Azikielboi: @talkley if you needed 40 it would be far less likely u didnt have 1 of every class, xdd
[2:38:40] Sathenus: WE CANT EVEN GET 15 PEOPLE
[2:38:40] Thdlock: DUDE ASMAN IS SO BASED TRUE AND REAL INV TO ASMAN LAYER
[2:38:41] gzok__: talk about a crazy solution to a simple problem. 40 man raids to solve the problem of limited raid comps lmfao
[2:38:41] elvia_: i want 10 man mythic, this guy want to be back at 40
[2:38:42] ErikJugend: You brought over 20 warriors in the best classic comp
[2:38:42] ImpalerV: i want 100 people raids please
[2:38:43] neugassh: 40 man rwf would be so much better to watch KEKW
[2:38:44] Churchtrill: 40 man and 40fps
[2:38:45] Slayen84: imagine 40m Fyrakk?
[2:38:46] renarton: theyd be world boss level
[2:38:46] pflipz: getting 40 people together consistently multiple nights a week is crazy
[2:38:49] crucial1711: @baddecisiondanx they aren't chasing mythic BiS gear, because they can never do the fights to get it lol. I cleared heroic Sarkereth on day 1 in a pug. I didn't have to chase anything for that either.
[2:38:49] Lorrdzik: he know is hard now because raiding isnt popular anymore
[2:38:50] nellfin: delete raid buffs, they're only harming the game
[2:38:51] PleaseLessen: Streamer guild player take from Asmon lol
[2:38:52] bobtari: 40man raids would fry my computer
[2:38:53] waelrick: at least one person in his chat said hell na LUL
[2:38:54] iloveuminkey: 40 man raid? wtd
[2:38:54] huntercreeper54: imagine 40man denathrius, phase 1 would DESTROY the servers
[2:38:54] Scriix: getting 40 people set up with raid weak auras ahhahahahahaha
[2:38:56] nairb1: 40man is just LFR bud
[2:38:57] ungnyaa: 40 ppl would just lag the fuck out
[2:38:57] Arcinatos: @Thdlock baysed, so fucking sayzed
[2:38:57] Presarius712: leave 40man in the past
[2:38:58] Karaelolz: baseg
[2:38:58] velience: it's turbo cooked ye
[2:38:58] bezastian: that is so completely fucking insane holy shit. how incredibly hard it is for us to fill our 20 man roster week by week late into a tier is already rediculous
[2:38:58] Goodguygregxd: just bring back scrolls man
[2:39:00] FrilleJr: clown take
[2:39:02] VehxD: hes off a bean
[2:39:02] BigTrout3: see Wildstar
[2:39:02] Razzin_: guilds have to merge too
[2:39:02] burlin_: Smolderon with 40 people Despair
[2:39:02] NotD4k: imagine tindral with 40 people
[2:39:03] oonanilord: he's trying to say that they should make boss easier and bring back 40
[2:39:04] CloudyHS: Dentge
[2:39:04] ViiDak: a clown take from a clown person
[2:39:06] Docaan: KEKW
[2:39:06] darkgigaz: People want 10 man back, that would be better
[2:39:06] Razdruid: imagine your average mythic guild trying to wrangle enough people for a soak
[2:39:06] probeu: 4Head
[2:39:07] fronkacean: its cool Pog
[2:39:07] MagmaScythe: monkaS system daemons
[2:39:07] lieutenantdan416: baseg
[2:39:08] Clindo_: @Thdlock so true inv to layer BASED
[2:39:08] iloveuminkey: yeag
[2:39:08] alex_s93: the game can barely manage 30 man raids with the performance
[2:39:08] aithran: Dentge
[2:39:08] stenpotatis: this is just farming viewers
[2:39:08] waelrick: ICANT
[2:39:09] zenkodac: its not unpopular , its just straight bad
[2:39:09] Niconatelver: Cool
[2:39:10] talkley: well classic era is right there asmon :) why arent you playing it bro :)
[2:39:10] Qubuuuu: cool xdding
[2:39:11] yeahp0n: MIC DROP!
[2:39:12] enigmasvea: asmon haaaaaates 40man raiding
[2:39:13] Goodvin: 3head
[2:39:14] iloveuminkey: yeah its cool
[2:39:14] eyxx: it's cool xdd
[2:39:15] JakeTehBear: when was it cool?
[2:39:15] fzybny: Literally have an example of going from 20 -> 40 results and it killed WS
[2:39:16] Mtkx11: i would love 40 man normal diff
[2:39:17] Missingiscool: 10 man raids > 25 or 40 man
[2:39:18] omgwatlol: sounds like the dude who peaked at high school and wants life to change as it was then, instead of adapting
[2:39:18] traisc: it is cool... but it's also outdated
[2:39:19] brainrot_behavior: xdd
[2:39:19] zerossussy: ?
[2:39:19] fuzzli420: how can 40 man be less individual?
[2:39:20] belfastcl: @alarkin I think a lot of the people malding can't understand that things have been (could be) different
[2:39:20] fronkacean: JUST PLAY CLASSIC?
[2:39:20] Nel_28: We already lag like crazy on timdral with 20, let's make it 40 sure....
[2:39:20] JoaEUW: Bro asmongold just wants to play classic and wants retail to go back to classic its so fucking ringe
[2:39:21] Qwasty: To make 40 man viable the max difficulty would have to be normal
[2:39:22] CloudyHS: Kappa
[2:39:22] JakeTehBear: I dont think it was cool in BC
[2:39:23] ICitizenErasedI: it's a "because it was like this when i liked the game" take
[2:39:24] munasauna: yeah no
[2:39:25] warpless: man just wants world bosses
[2:39:25] fronkacean: THIS IS JUST CLASSIC
[2:39:27] zenkodac: he wants to play molten core
[2:39:28] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx sure when games were new and more modern game standards didn't even exist. Chase content is good and if people just want the content given to them because they play the game at all is a super bad take.
[2:39:28] ArcaneSyntax: Literally blinded by nostalgia
[2:39:29] dundlen: slideshows for even people with good pcs is sooooo coool....
[2:39:29] Keldory20: Kappa
[2:39:30] Churchtrill: he also has content brain
[2:39:30] heffdogga: sod players dont want 40 man mc lol
[2:39:30] Morayeden: He just doesn't like playing the game.
[2:39:31] freehawk1: His chat makes him stupid
[2:39:32] iloveuminkey: imagine 40man blaze
[2:39:32] ErikJugend: 40 man would lag so bad, holy lol
[2:39:32] enigmasvea: trueeeeeee
[2:39:33] BrandonAUS: yepp
[2:39:38] Vonkilington: True
[2:39:38] fatbotmgrrl: Is he comparing original Wrath to the new classic Wrath?  The addons and access to fight tactics and availability of videos and how-to articles makes the recent versions of classic an entirely different experience.
[2:39:38] ShadowBites: 100%
[2:39:39] Sathenus: roasted
[2:39:41] kags158: UPHILL IN THE SNOW BOTH WAYS
[2:39:41] TL_izPanda: m
[2:39:42] enigmasvea: Asmon wants classic wow raiding but hates classic wow KEKW
[2:39:42] luixun: he is smart in buisness but not smart in gaming
[2:39:42] klondike_wow: he wants classic, but he doesnt play classic
[2:39:42] noirlol: this guy lives in the past
[2:39:43] JERAULT: oof.
[2:39:43] rpgonlyforme: i've been saying this a lot lately, nostalgia glasses are so strong for people
[2:39:43] CloudyHS: real
[2:39:44] eyxx: old good new bad
[2:39:47] uncred95: ouch
[2:39:48] DasAutoChat: its very cool because my computer sounds alot Pog
[2:39:48] nanerpus_: You know, a lot of the things he is complaining about are solved by Heroic
[2:39:48] brainrot_behavior: Aware
[2:39:50] Austrian: damn Aware
[2:39:50] layoutes: 100 man would be better ngl
[2:39:51] Rafix1301: so true
[2:39:51] nothumbgamer_ttv: ThethumblessguyTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:39:51] munasauna: smart guy but just happens to be wrong about almost everything hmm
[2:39:52] huntercreeper54: he did not changed but have money now
[2:39:52] Faraday5001: 100% hes just projecting
[2:39:53] Protoman_702: at the same time im sure he would tell you karazhan was a sick raid and it was 10man
[2:39:53] SkrrtRussel: no shot lmao he just speaks confidently, he can"t even bathe regularly
[2:39:54] ThebluesBilly: sod players want to stay 10man LUL
[2:39:54] nayrcraig: He literally saying he wants to totally face roll them
[2:39:55] JakeParkbench: He doesnt have to organize it, just show up and use clout for loot thats why he likes it
[2:39:57] trickyshot_: Aware if you know
[2:39:57] sabaron: he doesnt even like classic
[2:39:58] aMoteofCosmicTruth: @Thdlock > YEP. TRUE AND REAL (i quit after WoTLK, better known as the real WoW era)
[2:39:59] gronost4j: but if we have 4 difficulties why does it matter that mythic is hard and they should make it easier wtff
[2:39:59] Wh1zdumb: @Maximum have you seen his debate with destiny back in the day? once challenged on most things he just crumbles lol
[2:39:59] asd123qwerty1: Aware
[2:40:01] PleaseLessen: I like cost of living 10 years a go. I know its not coming back though lol
[2:40:01] DigoCapiroto: gimme a 5 men raid
[2:40:02] iloveuminkey: why not 50man raid?
[2:40:04] zubulluu: 500 person raids, fuck it
[2:40:04] Yosty: Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
[2:40:05] belfastcl: I think he just wants a game where all content is more casual oriented, that's about it
[2:40:06] Trastus94: bring back 10 man
[2:40:07] Missingiscool: @Maximum SoD will die the moment 40 man raids come back over the 10 man raids people are loving
[2:40:07] nellfin: @iloveuminkey gotta keep that seed alive
[2:40:07] JWallace: easy raids sounds so boring
[2:40:08] JERAULT: 40 people all trying to get a word in edgewise. oh god
[2:40:11] vmaster11: PJSalt
[2:40:13] velience: @Maximum he said that wow nowadays reminds him of playing with his mom and friends and stuff so it's definitely nostalgia
[2:40:19] breidl1337: 40 Man Fyrakk :D OMEGALUL
[2:40:20] lukurjd: fuck it 500 man raids esketit
[2:40:24] ElderSeas: His opinion isn't nostalgia either because he doesn't play the thing he's supposedly nostalgic for. It's just content for him where he gives whatever hot take he thinks of in the moment
[2:40:24] Manu7: 30 man heroic are such a mess
[2:40:26] ShadowBites: I think he has said in a previous stream that a lot of his weird takes on the game DO come from when WoW was more centered to his life and he played a lot with his mom
[2:40:27] sigabr: Completely delusional
[2:40:27] Wildfire_Gaming: a 40 man raid would kill my pc :(
[2:40:27] talkley: didnt asmon quit classic cause he was bored of it?
[2:40:28] Thdlock: 40 MAN FYRAKK 25 SEEDS
[2:40:28] Thdlock: YES
[2:40:31] SpaEngi: 40 man tindral WAYTOODANK.
[2:40:32] jamiboiy: if anything bring 10 man mythic LUL
[2:40:33] SpaEngi: 40 man tindral WAYTOODANK
[2:40:34] alarkin: @belfastcl Ya maybe that's it. I've raided mythic progression since mythic came out in MoP, I did heroic before that. There can be a better balance than our current state. Tindral and Fyrakk are emblematic of a very serious problem with how mythic is designed - so now is a chance for them to do better.
[2:40:34] stenpotatis: i wish they did 1 man raid
[2:40:35] gretriku: make 100 man raids. 100 people all storming a raid together would look SICK
[2:40:37] Lindorn_: logistics would be wild
[2:40:39] texazbandit: just come out with a completely new game at this point lol
[2:40:42] Sathenus: it would also mean it would be hella optimal to CRAZY CLASS stack the highest dps class
[2:40:45] yeahp0n: were talking about the opinion of the most famously selfish wow player of all time. fak'em
[2:40:45] Scoops__: you dont even need to have played at a high level to know getting 20 people together is hard
[2:40:45] Demiguise: legion, no raid buffs.
[2:40:46] Riberson1: WideTHD
[2:40:46] JERAULT: imagine a raid group needing like 10 officers
[2:40:47] dobi_gg: @Thdlock yes dude
[2:40:48] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel that has no relevance to what you said at all. you said wow was always like this from the beginning and no it wasn't. it's actually contrary to what you said.
[2:40:49] pjcurtin: bring back scrolls
[2:40:50] Scriix: you dneed a 60 man roster, and youd still be missing people come raid night hahah
[2:40:50] iloveuminkey: 40man blaze PoG
[2:40:51] i_Static: easy for the guy that can insta have thousands of applicants & get carried say it would be cool lol
[2:40:51] Ardal_Obe: Imagine sludgefist with 40 people
[2:40:54] iamthegodcomplex: Make it so classes overlap on buffs
[2:40:56] Jarlan23: if raids were 40 man my server would only be able to field 1 guild in total
[2:40:57] huntercreeper54: ngl 40man tindral when everyone start flying would be really epic
[2:41:00] Wikedlyrics: imagine modern wow mechanics on 40 man raids, shit lags like hell on 30 man heroics
[2:41:02] muffe100: @Thdlock 40 blazes PogChamp
[2:41:03] MagmaScythe: mangoHmm how many warriors for perma rally?
[2:41:04] VehxD: lets have a 50 man LMAO!
[2:41:04] longbonk: need quantum computers to run a 40man raid
[2:41:04] luixun: wow classic was warry stack
[2:41:07] Celestial990: @Thdlock no, just 40 man fyrakk where the only mechanic is the tank frontals
[2:41:09] elvia_: make the boss room two time larger
[2:41:10] elblasto: all buffs + 20 sub rogues
[2:41:11] ZacMehoph: 40 rets LETSGO
[2:41:12] zenkodac: or do scroll buffs that last 2hours, i wouldnt mind those back
[2:41:12] sabaron: i mean classic WoW groups had like 25  warriors
[2:41:13] Tidget: MC was always stacked with certain classes
[2:41:13] SniggleJake572: @Maximum you would stack warriors like classic KEKW
[2:41:14] FeedTheTrees: you bring 2/3 warriors and then buffs, remember that?
[2:41:14] Goltez: or like classic now just stack warriors
[2:41:15] ThisIsAsabel: nah, classic wow is full of neckbeards asking for your entire life credentials to get into a group
[2:41:17] valarbravoosi: Weren't there more raid buffs in MoP? like pally mastery etc, but remember comps don't being as important
[2:41:17] Starforkx: @Thdlock i'll one up you.... 25 man fyrakk, 40 seeds
[2:41:17] Tidget: like mages
[2:41:18] fuzzli420: 30 warri stack in classic. Make it possible in Retail
[2:41:18] crud_r: @Maximum They said they want 1 of every class in every raid and it's absolutely insane they are on record explicitly.
[2:41:22] nathkin: literally classic just stacked warriors
[2:41:22] Monsuno: 14 mages or something
[2:41:23] Basic_3: 8 Rogue Amirdrassial
[2:41:23] Silencbank: why not just make drums and the inscription things like fort full power in raid?
[2:41:24] codydoubleu: imagine the BM hunters Rogues and DHs in amirdrassil if u didn’t need buffs
[2:41:25] Cozo_TV: I'm confused, do they just want normal raiding ? easy, no comps problem, 30 man. Mythic isn't for everyone, I don't mythic raid because I don't have the time
[2:41:25] genjuro: EQ had 72 man raids in 1999
[2:41:28] sigabr: Or u just stack broken classes and gg
[2:41:28] Protoman_702: bfa scrolls were cool
[2:41:29] Karaelolz: the game lags enough in 20 man mythic raiding with a $5k PC when things go hectic, imagine with 40
[2:41:29] the_duper: theres a reason a classic raid was 20+ warriors
[2:41:29] mumboze: 20 demon hunters lets go
[2:41:31] MonarchTeaV: they tried that in bfa with the scrolls
[2:41:33] yeyanow: You just stack the best melee dps and the best ranged dps
[2:41:34] ashla11: it would be like classic where they bring 10 warriors to raids
[2:41:36] Ristvakbaen1911: "Oh your class has a raid buff but does shit damage? You don't have a raid buff? Bye!"
[2:41:36] nayrcraig: Yes, but without buffs the dropoff is less harsh at lower levels
[2:41:37] みょせつ: @Celestial990 and half the classic players would still be dead at the end of the fight KEKW
[2:41:37] rpgonlyforme: oh yeah, let's do that.  30 warriors in a raid, or it is dogshit design
[2:41:38] Scriix: use the talent system to let poeple choose a raid buff maybe
[2:41:39] breidl1337: 40 man fyrakk on mythic :D lets do this, sounds like stupid fun!
[2:41:39] lachi_mondala: 10 man raids were my favorite
[2:41:40] Missingiscool: modern 40 man raid boss design would have too many failure points and not enough space to do anything fun
[2:41:41] glaidsz: There was a time we didn't have raidbuffs right ?
[2:41:42] iloveuminkey: 20 unholy dk
[2:41:42] crucial1711: People will always bring whatever gives that 0.5% edge, rather thats because of buffs,utility, or just raw numbers.
[2:41:42] nothumbgamer_ttv: hunters pets bringing every buff was huge
[2:41:45] talkley: thanks for the ad Prayge
[2:41:46] MonarchTeaV: we even still have drums
[2:41:49] Crazyhealer1: they had scrolls that would give you raid buffs. why did they get rid of that? just bring that back
[2:41:53] NotD4k: imagine no raid buffs on scantum, just do full venth boomy raids KEKW
[2:41:55] ThisIsAsabel: people in classic wow today do not play like back then
[2:41:56] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx sure it wasn't from the very beginning, but it has changed and has been this way for most of its life. Bringing up classic and tbc like they're the gold standard when the game has been like this for longer than it hasn't is irrelevant.
[2:41:56] gronost4j: there would be way more fotm rerolling, guilds would look for like >5 hunters/rogues this tier
[2:41:58] yeyanow: They do serve a role to force some class diversity
[2:42:00] Azikielboi: KEKW
[2:42:02] zenkodac: and everyone knows merges always go great
[2:42:02] beels189: GA was hype
[2:42:03] Shaduoken: Shaduoken subscribed with Prime. 
[2:42:05] MagmaScythe: 20man DS was great. 40 man was.....
[2:42:06] PrimeTimeRime: the people calling for 40 man are the same people who’s computers would explode if they ever pulled a boss
[2:42:07] MangoAndKiwi: they're doing that in sod, its going from 10 man to 20
[2:42:10] nanerpus_: they are about to do the same thing with SOD
[2:42:12] Missingiscool: you can barely merge 2 m+ groups into a 10 man raid
[2:42:12] tubbysux: iamgine echo merge with limit kekw
[2:42:15] panacer: @Maximum they're doing that in SoD right now 10 > 20
[2:42:20] Superhank: smolderon KEKW
[2:42:21] MonarchTeaV: wild star had some damn good raid bosses
[2:42:21] kotabraun: It took 4 guild mergers for us to get a group going for DS40
[2:42:21] JERAULT: and look what happened to wildstar Sadge
[2:42:21] crucial1711: Smolderon
[2:42:22] Clindo_: my guild in wow died because of a merger
[2:42:22] vanicax: y can’t the 40 be a lfr type or normal type just for fun…. not always neeeds to be peak gaming
[2:42:23] wowecho: 40 man Smolderon
[2:42:23] nightst314: when will people finally stop participating in his online therapy session called "I want my teenage years back!"?
[2:42:23] Pandho: like at the end of mop
[2:42:24] Razdruid: imagine tindral seeds with 40 people
[2:42:25] Clindo_: Sadge
[2:42:28] dundlen: @maximum patchwerk
[2:42:29] adobegainz1: Tindral 40 man let's get it
[2:42:30] Moochie: didn’t the community ruin classic raiding with their whole world buffs required shit?
[2:42:30] backerxx: I wish they had more talent point coverages for raid buffs.
[2:42:34] Rinehartgaming: Imagine Halondrus bombs on 40 man......oooof
[2:42:34] jamiboiy: even casual guild merges get pretty wild LUL
[2:42:35] glorkwimp: Ghuun
[2:42:36] Themselves: 40 man tindral HOLY

[2:42:39] EasyBreezier: 40 man sludgefist
[2:42:40] funnybunny_hs: imagine smolderon 40 man
[2:42:42] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel i'm not saying it's the gold standard or the right way at all. but is the current iteration that?  i don't think so. otherwise numbers wouldn't be in a constant decline
[2:42:42] ColdIceCreamMan: imagine echo and method merging
[2:42:43] asd123qwerty1: razageth 40 man 2 fps Aware @maximum
[2:42:47] Razzin_: hes out of touch, he would just invite 39 viewers
[2:42:48] MagmaScythe: it becomes impossible
[2:42:49] Missingiscool: SoD with more than 10 man raids is the beginning of the end of SoD
[2:42:49] zenkodac: if the boss only has one mechanic you dont need to worry about lag
[2:42:50] JERAULT: 40 man mythic gorefiend
[2:42:50] KlKlDlKl: 40 man volcoross. lets go
[2:42:53] carbonstylus: imagine the lag on pull with all the calulations of everyone popping their shit
[2:42:53] Scoops__: imagine all the splits youd have to run
[2:42:55] ectocantaim: computer explodes on first mechanic
[2:42:57] crucial1711: The only fights that would be good 40 man would be fights like Al'Akir from cataclysm, where there's not too much personal responsibility
[2:42:59] nightst314: Molten Core was a fucking meme
[2:43:00] huntercreeper54: 40 man volcoross could be a nice place management @Maximum
[2:43:01] elvia_: powerpoint 40 man raiding FeelsGoodMan
[2:43:01] wonkus1: a 40 man 1-boss raid owuld be cool

[2:43:03] branzdeadtv: branzdeadtv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:43:04] nationas: @Maximum what if 40 min 1 boss raids crazyness
[2:43:04] Dacoolface: So your saying Liquid and Echo merging would go badly? LUL
[2:43:04] blinkawayz: the lag on tindral with 20 people is bad enough.. wtf you mean 30 man.. lol even doing the world bosses with a full raid goup or the super bloom lags most people like crazy
[2:43:08] MonarchTeaV: I’d rather see 10 man come back over 40
[2:43:08] Crystallize007: @KlKlDlKl best boss to do 40 man, since you would just have 2x 20 man raids
[2:43:08] GuapSama: WICKED COOL
[2:43:09] oonanilord: @Scoops__ because most pp don't like to raid now, that's what baldie trying to say is to make it easier and more pp get involved
[2:43:12] NotD4k: KEKW
[2:43:13] Tutpup: Well, also, his entire argument is that raids should be easier no?
[2:43:15] Austrian: ????
[2:43:16] bezastian: yes its not true people are more competitive it doesnt matter if its 40 or 20. i played wow classic and we had a completely restricted roster for speedruns aswell. if you didnt play fury you were fucked. even on pug runs people would go half fury warrior just to make the clear easier
[2:43:17] GearzxGaming: LUL
[2:43:17] lukurjd: ???????????
[2:43:17] Jarlan23: the last time he raided seriously was in classic wow

[2:44:02] i_Static: asmons opinions aren’t even nostalgic, he just thinks of how fun they would be from his perspective not the average player
[2:44:03] zenkodac: lets see how much he talks on that
[2:44:03] Tushytantrum2: i think raid buffs can only be good if there are more raid buffs available than what you can fit into a raid, so it would add a strategic choice to what buffs you bring
[2:44:05] JERAULT: bro, asmon is on the SPITROAST this stream
[2:44:06] lukurjd: blud just found out about pings

[2:44:19] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx I'm not saying it's perfect either, and I agree that it should be improved. It definitely isn't perfect, but having Chase content that requires you to get better at the game is good for the game.

[2:44:28] maydays505: the one thing I hate about current state of wow raid is for smaller guilds l10-12 mans is the raid being tuned MOSTLY for 20 man and making bosses like Fyrakk/Nymue infinitely harder as a an example, forcing you to either have more skill/gear to progress or specific class comps or your boned

[2:44:45] Niroggo: PepeLaugh
[2:44:46] PleaseLessen: lmao that will fix class balancing. UI changes
[2:44:46] Cuensour: there is the ff14 take
[2:44:47] Laxxean: id quit the game SO FAST
[2:44:47] The_Frix: fuck addons
[2:44:47] Missingiscool: delete addons would be fine. raids would compensate in difficulty
[2:44:47] spivet: thats true CSGO is so competitive because of all the weakauars
[2:44:48] khanqor: I would hate that tbh
[2:44:48] Monsuno: infinite smold macros
[2:44:48] PrimeTimeRime: lmaoooooo
[2:44:48] Galarian_Hp: bad take
[2:44:49] Theblueninjashen: He is describing GW2 but he hates it
[2:44:50] JWallace: no dps meter?
[2:44:51] Gutshots: no fun allowed
[2:44:52] Thealzki: yeah thats totally working in ff14 and lost ark lmao
[2:44:52] i_Static: easy -50% subs
[2:44:52] Dagnet: love taking 40mins in a dungeon in ff14 and cant even know who is low dps
[2:44:52] Osterberg501: Asmon can't complete normal with addons, what he gonna do without them
[2:44:52] GoodGuyEli74: would help but ppl would still find whats best regardless
[2:44:54] Ruinx81: I like seeing how I’m doing
[2:44:55] MajorFrog225: lol this chat is cancer
[2:44:55] AJrigor: this guys fuckin cooking
[2:44:56] tutizz_: i hate the ping thing but its sooo easy to get ppls attention
[2:44:56] okidokiboss: right idea but wrong execution
[2:44:57] Welsy_: Noone is touching my ELVUI
[2:44:58] mestarvirus: would make it cool tbh
[2:44:58] Thdlock: FUCK ADDONS baseg
[2:44:58] Welsy_: fuck that
[2:44:59] MonarchTeaV: it’s a good take
[2:45:00] valefollin: they could implement the systems that actually improve qol in game
[2:45:05] SketchyAkechii: FF does this and yet... theres TOOOOONS of 3rd party addons/mods
[2:45:05] Scriix: i despise parse culture
[2:45:07] okidokiboss: the wow API needs to be absolutely gutted
[2:45:08] Crystallize007: ban voice comms also, imagine people that don't have a raid leader
[2:45:08] Clox9: This is out of hands
[2:45:08] vanicax: lost ark
[2:45:10] Cakerinotv: Honestly IMO W take but wow would need to DRASTICALLY change their ui and improve their UI to actually make it remotely even doable
[2:45:11] Balamb: fuck addons BASED
[2:45:12] Starcillo: fun = a third party doing the things for you LUL
[2:45:14] bezastian: THAT DOESNT WORK EITHER. i played LA and the community went HARD on theorycrafting and STILL figured out numbers etc and metas developed
[2:45:17] Diazanite: @alarkin wow has always been a seasonal game wym? every expansion is a season, every raid is a season within a season, arenas have had seasons from its inception. i dont really get the take that some people cant clear the raid so it should be made easier so more people can clear it when there are 4 difficulties for people to experience the raid through
[2:45:18] ThisIsAsabel: add ons got out of control, but they are part of the game and very fun once you get into it
[2:45:18] Arcinatos: HACKERMANS me going on the darkweb looking for black market weakauras after the addon TOS incident
[2:45:19] timmayb166: this would be a complete overhaul to the game you can’t play this game without weak auras
[2:45:20] Archerone: People with this take have no concern for accessibility
[2:45:20] Badd_Rabbit: if they got rid of addons i bet half of players never play again
[2:45:26] TL_izPanda: its so interesting that him and I can just have the exact opposite opinions on everything
[2:45:27] Thdlock: only addon is dmg meter baseg
[2:45:28] Watajoke: WEAK AURAS ARE FAR TOO STONG
[2:45:30] grozzarr: run here
[2:45:31] ThePencilShow: @Starcillo do you think damage meters are playing the game for you? KEKL
[2:45:32] Razdruid: you mean like liquids wa pack? lOL
[2:45:32] Nenemene: WEAK AURAS SLAVES IN SHAMBLES
[2:45:32] maplelost: Its way too late to ever consider that
[2:45:34] SketchyAkechii: It will just be the requirement of people using something that is trusted and official to sketchy ass addons/3rd party programs
[2:45:35] metel7: echo map LUL
[2:45:35] Austrian: @Thdlock holy baseg
[2:45:35] raikino: asmon is such a
[2:45:39] Timothy_Longshorts: nobody taking my luxthos away from me
[2:45:43] Starcillo: @Badd_Rabbit they will realize that they were shit all this time
[2:45:45] Greannan: Give more time for mechanics
[2:45:45] JoaEUW: Imagine the circles on Anduin was way harder to see so a weakaura would just show it, that'd be bad but idk
[2:45:46] Qwasty: Ban weakauras
[2:45:47] Balamb: @Thdlock HOLY
[2:45:50] silver4: my warrior spell reflect weakaura felt like cheating
[2:45:54] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel that's completely disingenuous.  Have you ever raided in a casual aotc guild?  they are absolutely braindead. they are carried by a solid 4-6 people. There is nothing to chase, they are literally incapable.  95% of the community will never in their life regardless of what happens be able to participate in that content.
[2:45:55] Protips: @Diazanite amen
[2:46:00] huntercreeper54: yeah but he's like delete 70% of people interface
[2:46:01] xcesme: if you think this add-on fiesta is healthy you are clueless
[2:46:04] laylaylo0om: I am pretty sure, he and his gang wouldnt play this game he is describing more than a month
[2:46:05] JonatanXaD: @Maximum I still remember Ra-Den M being ABSOLUTELY carried by weakauras
[2:46:08] nightst314: Parrot is the better SCT; keep it
[2:46:13] Starcillo: @ThePencilShow they are talking about the interface dummy
[2:46:13] malavander: Meters are the reason I play WoW.  Not because I care about parsing, just because it's a visual indicator of your power potential.  I miss having that in every other game.
[2:46:13] MajorFrog225: think he’s cool with cosmetic addons and weak aura. he’s said that before
[2:46:15] avenira_qt: agree
[2:46:17] BrandonAUS: @laylaylo0om facts
[2:46:18] raizoontv: Bro watching this together in a poddy c would’ve been a banger maximumSnackies
[2:46:19] pjcurtin: weakauras that play the game for you bad. weakauras in general not bad
[2:46:21] Nenemene: WEAKAURACUCKS MALDING OMEGALUL
[2:46:21] donutboyj: WAs are not really a problem, blizzard relying on them is the problem
[2:46:21] MrColvr: his chat literally thinks weakauras play the game for you
[2:46:22] ThisIsAsabel: the ways you can customize your UI trough add ons IS very fun
[2:46:25] texazbandit: weakuras should definitely go
[2:46:27] sigabr: Blizz still using "red on red" markers on mechanics...
[2:46:28] avenira_qt: the ui customization from addons in wow is one of the best parts of the game imo
[2:46:31] Tortellini13: yeah if they make me get rid of my fire mage anime girl reskin weakauras im throwing hands
[2:46:32] Clox9: Remove weakaura
[2:46:33] Azikielboi: he thinks that becaues you can do that, they make specs/the game more complicated @Maximum and he doesnt like how complicated it is now
[2:46:34] Thdlock: only addon is dmg meter baseg
[2:46:35] the_great_simonator: I would never EVER be able to play my arcane mage without my WA. idc if it's a skill issue, it makes the class so much easier to play
[2:46:35] Morayeden: every game should be like that
[2:46:37] zubulluu: Encounter design is the issue, not weakauras
[2:46:37] Tutpup: The argument for "remove all addons" is that it's an easy, unbiased "fix" for the "addon issue".
[2:46:40] Slapsstick: i play other games and im like, "damn, I wish i had details for the memes"
[2:46:40] cornflakezza: i cant Play with blizzard Standard UI
[2:46:44] huntercreeper54: remember the guy having a dh bike interface @Maximum
[2:46:44] ErikJugend: Some classes in the game would literally be unplayable by not being able to track some buffs in the middle of your screen
[2:46:46] Clush___: @Maximum path of exile also takes an incredibly hard-line stance against modifying their ui and i agree
[2:46:46] walmartpjs: @Thdlock baseg
[2:46:46] NerdRagedOut: i use default, confirmed am gamer
[2:46:46] fuzzli420: Trilllllllllllll

[2:46:57] dinnerh: Sang
[2:46:58] crucial1711: Imexile's UI
[2:47:00] baddecisiondanx: I raided heroic without addons every time. it's not that bad.
[2:47:02] layoutes: bliz should hire addon guys and make them options
[2:47:02] Austrian: how would removing addons make it less competitive tho
[2:47:03] BigTrout3: Nick jpcJuiced
[2:47:03] zenkodac: the only thing that keeps me from playing other mmos is that wow is the only one that you can customize it a shitton and not have to take a master degree in programing
[2:47:05] NDRandell: It's true. James's UI is hideous
[2:47:07] Cakerinotv: I'd like them to get rid of them but I honestly dont think its even remotely possible for blizzard to ever get their default UI to a point where it would be even usable over weak aruas
[2:47:08] hotmanpop: i played without weakauras for years, tried them when DF started, it's braindead
[2:47:08] Line_0: Bag addons are also bis
[2:47:10] AceofRaphy: ^Whens the last time you played with natty UI?
[2:47:10] one2one04: nick UI
[2:47:11] Slapsstick: @baddecisiondanx same for a while
[2:47:11] Razdruid: I hate being forced to use weak auras to play in mythic raids and mythic plus
[2:47:11] Balamb: or its a symptom of an a multi-decade old design.
[2:47:12] Kiqa__: rare scanner GIGACHAD
[2:47:14] Doimos89: Asmon is so far gone with these takes I'm actually surprised
[2:47:16] Kimisitra: addonq are fine as long as they are not "required" to play properly the game
[2:47:16] Rahvin331: Even Quik used Elvui, the pres didnt like default ui
[2:47:20] gretriku: yipz has one of the worst UI's ever and he's fucking amazing lol
[2:47:21] Moaklerqt: bag addons are goated
[2:47:21] Niconatelver: our guild NEEDS the Wa's to kill hard mythic bosses
[2:47:23] CloudyHS: MrDestructoid

[2:47:25] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[2:47:27] ShabsieAU: @Maximum im pretty sure his take is dmg meters because hes talking about meta gaming
[2:47:28] MajorFrog225: asmon doesn’t have a problem with noncombat addons
[2:47:28] NotD4k: fyrakk intermission
[2:47:29] Pariousa: Pariousa subscribed with Prime. 
[2:47:30] NotD4k: Aware
[2:47:31] RoloDB: @NDRandell and the way he does his macros/binds is very unique lol
[2:47:32] CloudyHS: Looking
[2:47:32] renarton: weak aura prog is soul crushing
[2:47:33] DanVicious: i think he is talking about damage meter to supatease comment in his chat about stacking warriors because they did most dmg in vanilla too
[2:47:36] Lindorn_: MrDestructoid Madge
[2:47:39] jamiboiy: I used to use a sunglasses weakaura so I could actually see in Bastion FeelsGoodMan
[2:47:39] Artheeri: rare scanner ruined dreamsurges and pet battle for me Madge it also plays M Tindral for me Madge
[2:47:40] Missingiscool: I think he only means add ons that assist in combat
[2:47:41] duel00: you have to progress the WA before the boss
[2:47:42] Balamb: noncombat addons are fine. the rest is dogshit.
[2:47:49] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx yes I have, and the group I was one of the carriers. If the players want to get the better gear, they need to get better at the game and meet the requirements. Is it too hard now? Maybe, but nothing until the last few bosses in mythic is unkillable by people who actually want to get better lol
[2:47:49] iloveuminkey: 40man weak aura time RageyBoom
[2:47:54] fatbotmgrrl: Maybe that could be the mythic fix.  Mythic raid mode doesn't allow addons.
[2:47:58] cornflakezza: atro UI
[2:48:00] Azikielboi: he thinks that becaues you can make your ui "better" like proc trackers, they make specs/the game more complicated @Maximum and he doesnt like how complicated it is now
[2:48:00] hotmanpop: PROGRAMMING RACE
[2:48:05] Thdlock: only addon is dmg meter baseg
[2:48:14] iamthegodcomplex: he doesn't want damage meters
[2:48:17] JonatanXaD: @donutboyj They don't rely on them, they have to make bosses abilities harder because if not a random dude makes a WA that automatize the fight if it's easy
[2:48:18] Cakerinotv: @Thdlock baseg
[2:48:21] Qubuuuu: KEKW
[2:48:21] hotmanpop: @Thdlock YEP
[2:48:22] zenkodac: private auras was a valiant try now they need to keep improving
[2:48:22] malavander: addons are how they crowdsource UI improvements
[2:48:25] maplelost: YASS QUEEN
[2:48:26] huntercreeper54: YESS YEP
[2:48:27] Kiqa__: KEKW
[2:48:27] CloudyHS: moronic asmon chatters

[2:48:39] jayelayy: I can’t play wow without addons anymore
[2:48:39] deadie3D: YES
[2:48:39] MorandoTv: I think they mean warcraft logs/Details mainly
[2:48:39] Kiqa__: YESSSSSSSSSSS
[2:48:40] ImpalerV: with all due respect, Asmon doesn't play WoW either yet we are here listening to 48 minutes of him talk.
[2:48:40] crucial1711: I mean how do you think he got famous in the first place classic
[2:48:40] darkbringerrgw2: Oh Ui discussions interesting
[2:48:40] Tanonn: @Thdlock baseg
[2:48:41] Clindo_: Because they don't play the game
[2:48:41] Goodvin: oh we just wanna watch some crazy shitshow on RWF

[2:48:42] TheItalianStallion321: i was just gonna say. those people are just Asmongold sheep. they are his groupies
[2:48:45] DanVicious: @Maximum he thinks that if you get rid of damage meter you dont have meta or spec stacking etc
[2:48:45] deadie3D: YES QUEEN
[2:48:45] audrock7: Yep Asmonsheepols
[2:48:46] JoaEUW: Pilav called asmongolds viewers out waaaay back calling them sheep
[2:48:46] みょせつ: YES
[2:48:46] BigTrout3: world quest, crafting, auctioneer, all GOATED addons
[2:48:46] AceofRaphy: ACTUALLY I am

[2:48:47] azm07: if they will say no they gona get banned
[2:48:48] noirlol: asmongold NPCS going hard ICANT
[2:48:48] nellfin: if bartender's gone, i'm gone
[2:48:48] Mitune: mainly they are saying no dps meter to break it down simplest term @Maximum
[2:48:48] Darkenet: garf
[2:48:49] Themselves: DRAMA
[2:48:51] i_Static: just bowing down to daddy asmon tbh
[2:48:51] spivet: whenever I open my bag addon I think "this is obscene"
[2:48:51] Arcinatos: ASMAN TAKE, BETTER SPAM TRUE LULW TRUE
[2:48:52] Hordiix: that's twitch max. streamer says words and chat says "TRUE" @Maximum
[2:48:52] FrilleJr: i fucking hate the peggle addon
[2:48:52] Cakerinotv: true, but wouldn't it be better if it was actually in teh base game
[2:48:52] Naaven: Then implement this addon into the game you moron
[2:48:52] Razzin_: all 14 players
[2:48:53] huntercreeper54: Clap
[2:48:54] angrycalf87743: wow is unplayable without addons
[2:48:55] ShadowBites: His twitch chat is nothing more than an echo chamber with no coherent thought lol
[2:48:55] enigmasvea: Asmon would NEVER play WoW without addons KEKW HAHA
[2:48:55] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx the people you're saying they need to cater to just want to have the stuff given to them without having to improve. You're essentially advocating for the "elo" system which is raid tiers to just be gone and have skill be irrelevant, which is a bad take
[2:48:55] spiritcheese: garf
[2:48:56] Cjpriest: addons are literal trash and should be A PART of the game as it is
[2:48:56] Zorto5: remove details so my teamates cant flame my bad dps

[2:49:04] Entr0pia: Entr0pia subscribed with Prime. 
[2:49:06] TheRealDivert: nah as a non paladin, I want them to remove pally power to annoy my pally friends
[2:49:07] iloveuminkey: go ffiv
[2:49:08] Thasin22: no matter which stream you watched its a echo chamber  lol
[2:49:08] BobAwesome: Asmon isn't even thinking about the players with disabilities that rely on addons to play the game.
[2:49:09] misdota: Addons are the equivalent of having open source code. It's the standard these days. community driven improvements
[2:49:09] crucial1711: TRUE AND REAL YOU KNOW HE KNOWS IT EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
[2:49:09] yeyanow: You can still play without add-ons and do normal or heroic
[2:49:09] ThisIsAsabel: people not knowing addons thinking other people are carried by things they don't know shit baout
[2:49:11] Wikedlyrics: KEKW what

[2:49:15] BigTrout3: cap
[2:49:16] aMoteofCosmicTruth: a bald velen said so tho it must be true
[2:49:16] tutizz_: he is just a mount farmer anyways
[2:49:16] jayelayy: wow definitely trash without addons
[2:49:17] gelloz_: asmon is not a voice of authority
[2:49:19] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel yes it is objectively too hard for them to do it. they are literally incapable. They do not have the capability to do it. They are garbage. Should it be changed. Idk i'm not saying it should be changed. I'm simply communicating their pov
[2:49:21] YugeCrit: I dont agree with it, but long term it might be better if Wow took at stance like FF14
[2:49:21] Missingiscool: he def only talking about combat addons
[2:49:23] ThePencilShow: Imfiredup is only 100% better than me Pepega
[2:49:23] quzulu: imagine having to look at 25 buffs in the top right corner to find out if you have a proc or not
[2:49:25] MrAxeffect: LFG ONLY GANG
[2:49:25] zannuss: Can I just log in and have my full bis please
[2:49:25] Thdlock: ASMON TRUUUU
[2:49:27] aithran: unnatural Dentge
[2:49:29] zenkodac: LUL butthurt because he couldnt clear sutff even with WAs
[2:49:29] spiritcheese: whats bad with raid-loggs?
[2:49:31] SideOf6: "not only are they better than you"
[2:49:32] ElderSeas: Asmongold is bad at games and he wants to take away add-ons because he thinks it will make others bad also
[2:49:32] responselimited: Add-ons are fine. why is this a thing again? Add-ons are fine weakauras are fine
[2:49:33] Razdruid: thats not true. just look at THD. dude has like the most basic UI possible and is absolutely insane.
[2:49:33] Dreiizer: Remove details fuck it
[2:49:35] Cakerinotv: @Maximum its also just a knowledge pain point, it makes it harder for new players to get into the game
[2:49:35] urmadlife: Based
[2:49:37] Cjpriest: its not because it should be QOL updates as it id
[2:49:37] smoothlol: SET TO 1.25X
[2:49:39] kj01a: But everybody has access to the same addons...
[2:49:39] Azikielboi: proc trackers make blizz make specs harder @Maximum and he doesnt like that
[2:49:40] Slapsstick: then just get the addons too? i dont get being mad about things anyone can get LUL
[2:49:42] ThebluesBilly: he wants to remove details

[2:50:04] Arcinatos: those capital G gamers Madge
[2:50:04] Harry_barry_larry: literally his catchphrase is big dick dps on details
[2:50:05] dundlen: @maximum even if blizz makes amazing ingame visuals that are perfect, which i would love, people will STILL make weak auras, and that isn't a bad thing necessarily.
[2:50:05] Darkenet: If I didnt see how much damage Im doing I wouldnt play the fucking game
[2:50:05] Gorakk82: Based
[2:50:05] huntercreeper54: get rid of the dh bike interface it's so broken @Maximum KEKW
[2:50:06] walmartpjs: ok but thd cares
[2:50:08] mikejonesrp: lost ark doesnt have damage meters but people always download the "ToS" one
[2:50:09] Wildfire_Gaming: Madge
[2:50:09] Zorto5: HAH professionals
[2:50:10] VehxD: Xeno a FF player wishes they would add base things to the game like dps meters because it can help players improve
[2:50:13] vanicax: u need help
[2:50:14] Slapsstick: @Darkenet facts
[2:50:14] Thdlock: every mmo has dmg meter
[2:50:14] brainrot_behavior: Parse lords are the problem
[2:50:16] Galarian_Hp: @Thdlock but do u have numbers
[2:50:18] iloveuminkey: NOPERS
[2:50:18] smoothlol: SET TO 1.5X
[2:50:19] andaroo: I use details to challenge myself
[2:50:19] sabaron: good players dont care about dmg meters, they know they are good
[2:50:20] wonkus1: details is how u improve
[2:50:20] RoloDB: this whole react is such a banger lol
[2:50:22] brian_777777777: he still doesnt bring ret paladins to his raids
[2:50:22] donutboyj: TBH 90% of WOW players probably couldnt care less about WAs
[2:50:22] Slayen84: CAUGHT CAUGHT CAUGHT
[2:50:24] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx then that's an irrelevant point. Those players aren't what the content is aimed at lol
[2:50:24] cornflakezza: Maybe we can change mm with disband arkinventory
[2:50:25] Celestial990: A lot of the ppl that dont want dps meter think theyll get invited or wont get kicked for being bad too
[2:50:25] YugeCrit: i think the problem is NON professionals worry about damage meeters
[2:50:27] Clush___: @Thdlock ur raid leader big dumb idiot Sadge'
[2:50:28] ComicsWoW: man pulling %s out of his anus
[2:50:28] Thdlock: los tark has a dmg meter
[2:50:30] sigabr: I play details... wow is just the addon ,=)
[2:50:30] Thdlock: everyone uses it
[2:50:31] Welsy_: but how can I tell how well am I doing?
[2:50:32] ThebluesBilly: i like seeing big dps or big hps :)
[2:50:32] mortenerenroleplayer123: i would quit wow without details @Maximum
[2:50:33] PvtCheese: I like damage meters, but I really only use it to compare how well I am doing pull to pull
[2:50:36] filos0phia: do you use logs to recruit? @Maximum
[2:50:38] Scriix: parse lords!
[2:50:41] Schrootpoot: @Maximum gw2 is super strict with addons, but even they realised their game was better of with dmg meters
[2:50:42] bayazijr: Chasing improved parses is a fun minigame idk why people hate on that shit
[2:50:45] RoloDB: @Maximum Does asmon ever counter react to your points in stuff like this?
[2:50:45] crucial1711: Okay but lost ark has people just use down low damage meters, because its against ToS
[2:50:47] Cjpriest: @Thdlock no they dont lol if you get caught you catch a fat perma
[2:50:48] Clox9: I need that for my ego
[2:50:48] Manaflowx: Asmon was that person. That big dick dps kinda person
[2:50:48] Austrian: i like seeing how good/bad im doing
[2:50:48] maplelost: Lost Ark literally tells u at the end who is MvP WTF
[2:50:50] Tanonn: also asmon loved to pump the meters so idk
[2:50:52] stenpotatis: ahlaundoh
[2:50:52] jtp787: parse culture is 100% a thing and way more common than you think
[2:50:53] Kenigami: but if u look at like gingi vids and stuff doing m+. their baits r like doing XXX dmg?!
[2:50:57] luixun: the most top guilds are the nicest ppl they dont care about dps anyways xD if you make your job and you do what you need to do all is fine
[2:50:58] Ziguidiblopin: u cant run away from statistics, it happened in every sport that exists
[2:51:01] karbuna: I cant enjoy games and not knowing how i am doing. But i dont want to rub it in other people's faces
[2:51:01] Thdlock: @Cjpriest no one has been banned for it on NA for last year
[2:51:01] ThisIsAsabel: logs are fun, it a path of self-improvement and progression for players, if people care, they care, don't take it away from them
[2:51:02] wonkus1: people get a negative feeling from meters, without taking the time to analyze why they feel that way and what their goals actually are
[2:51:02] Razdruid: @Thdlock oh yeah Ive seen your UI when you stream once every 6 months. its super clean but basic elvui with Liquid wa basically and damage meter lol
[2:51:02] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel L take. Making content within their reach is not the same as handing it to them. And i'm not advocating for catering to them.  Your entire argument is literally stating takes no one is talking about as if they are mine. I'm done dude. you are literally unable to have a genuine conversation with.
[2:51:04] rottisxd: yung max is one of those guys
[2:51:04] crucial1711: Lost Ark community requires you to have a damage meter if you want to clear any of the hard content
[2:51:05] franross_: maplelost MVP is not just who did most dmg
[2:51:06] pjcurtin: thats half my guild...its insufferable
[2:51:06] malavander: infographics are fun and meters are great infographics
[2:51:07] fzybny: Dmg meters help makes the player better.
[2:51:09] MattOogle: dmg meter for me gives me an almost tangible way to understand when I am improving on my rotations and movements etc in a fight
[2:51:09] slappadabas5: haha what about that Monk the other night
[2:51:10] burlin_: I just wanna see if im improving between weeks and pulls
[2:51:12] Missingiscool: seems like a more casual design choice
[2:51:13] BrandonAUS: I understand it but would not like it at all
[2:51:14] atomicx1: What about playing aug evoker with out weakauras to see other people cds etc? @Maximum
[2:51:18] Snydezz: Damage meter doesn't even matter now if you have an aug in the group
[2:51:19] Cjpriest: @Thdlock that is not true literally at all
[2:51:21] yeyanow: I like meters because I can track my personal improvements
[2:51:23] Vardred32: i dislike not seeing dmg/not having logs. such a good tool to improve
[2:51:24] mute_tron: people would do more cc and support
[2:51:26] bigmeanbeefy: @jtp787 Yepp, ive had people ask for logs in a normal fyrakk :D
[2:51:28] ajcox11: i only use damage meters to help me get better and only for me not anyonen else
[2:51:30] fzybny: If there aren't dmg meters, someone will still figure it out and make a tier list anyways.
[2:51:31] Lorrdzik: @bayazijr crazy people will wipe ypour raid if they fucked and know they logs will be bad
[2:51:32] TL_izPanda: I would quit immediately if they took out damage meters. Self improvement and doing better than my last attempt is the ONLY thing I care about
[2:51:34] kj01a: You can do that with logs though
[2:51:34] YugeCrit: issue is people use Details to judge other players which i kinda understand the flak
[2:51:35] azm07: we play wow to feed our ego with big numbers on details thats how it is
[2:51:36] Austrian: neuron activation
[2:51:36] BrandonAUS: or use the compare thing to see why someone else did more damage
[2:51:36] Maruika: they should just make an in game personal dps meter only you can see
[2:51:36] thegrt13: @bayazijr theres a difference between measuring yourself against your past performance and getting better... and being a parse demon during an alt run begging for PI and wiping when you don't get procs
[2:51:38] Razdruid: lmao
[2:51:39] lunariszx: i try to beat my friends lol

[2:51:46] Tanonn: auged Aware
[2:51:46] Slapsstick: I was in a +12 AD and had a hunter doing 2k dps and wouldnt soak puddles on priestess, we kicked him after not soaking 4 times in a row and timed it 4 man LUL
[2:51:47] BabyDunn: i like proving BM hunters are still viable COPIUM

[2:51:51] Thdlock: @Cjpriest bro i play lost ark ive used meter for over 6 months ICANT
[2:51:51] Zaisx: I dont even look at details during a fight tbh
[2:51:52] DigoCapiroto: not having data is WAAAAY harder to improve. Best thing I did to learn havoc was getting psycho dungeon damage profile and try to replicate. Not having damage meters is fucking dogshit
[2:51:52] spruudel: aug GRRR
[2:51:53] Line_0: Details is the only way to track how I'm doing over time in game
[2:51:54] Starcillo: No aug Madge
[2:51:55] zenkodac: thats what i use for, i wanna improve so i log myself so i can see how i perform
[2:51:55] crucial1711: destro warlock getting 6 PI's a pull
[2:51:57] TheRealDivert: my only argument against non-combat addons being removed is that having themn not in the base game makes it harder for new players to enter the playground

[2:52:49] Tereekel: @baddecisiondanx I agree your take is bad. There is plenty of content in the reach of all of the garbage players, lfr, normal, heroic dungeons. If they want the best gear and items and coolest transmog, they should have to put effort into getting better to achieve it lol. You are objectively wrong

[2:53:35] Tutpup: @Cjpriest That's probably why you think people in the west gets banned for it. Literally no one has ever had proof for getting banned for Damage meter, it's always a scapegoat for RMT:ers xd
[2:53:35] Zaisx: Addons have existed in WoW literally since 2004
[2:53:35] fzybny: Moronic take
[2:53:35] spiritcheese: ICANT never

[2:53:39] VehxD: my alarm still goes off when i need to wake up but i won't turn it off because ill be late for work
[2:53:39] WolfgangAmpersand: It would kill the game kinda doing that.
[2:53:40] BunnyMountain: its so funny because asmon uses so many addons lol
[2:53:40] brainrot_behavior: I do baseg
[2:53:41] MajorFrog225: shouldnt they improve their game so you dont need addons?
[2:53:42] mikejonesrp: havent damage meters been in the game since vanilla

[2:53:57] ronindex1: id never play wow again if i cant use Elvui, i hate default UI feel
[2:53:59] Cjpriest: @Tutpup wrong. one of my main static tanks in lost ark got banned this year for it
[2:54:00] khanqor: he definitely just said that for interaction no way he really thinks that
[2:54:04] Gorakk82: rehaul the whole ui etc
[2:54:05] zannuss: So addons that track cosmetics like transmog should be banned also? Sounds like he wants to alienate people who just collect stuff from old content
[2:54:06] Darkenet: Where would Blizz get the resources to replace all the addons in default
[2:54:07] aMoteofCosmicTruth: this is the sylvanas BURN IT arc but for addons
[2:54:07] Cjpriest: @Thdlock literally wrong
[2:54:07] malavander: it's a whole cottage industry that supports the game
[2:54:09] NelsinVT: NelsinVT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:54:11] Tutpup: @Cjpriest 100% he was RMTing buddy.
[2:54:12] Fannypackk: my addons are literally details weakauras and dbm
[2:54:13] KlKlDlKl: asmon doesnt even play the game anymore, bro is just nostalgia hungry
[2:54:14] malnourish_: every single person I’ve ever met in wow uses at least 3 addons
[2:54:14] grozzarr: what about sexy map
[2:54:15] fokare: @mikejonesrp I think they started being adopted in tbc moreso than vanilla
[2:54:17] Clox9: Its alot better to play without addons in DF I would say
[2:54:19] StarShopping95: Classic players say "delete all add ons" then wipe the last boss in Gnomer to not kicking a single cast KEKW
[2:54:21] baddecisiondanx: @Tereekel at this point you're just made because at every turn i've made you realize you don't even know what you're arguing. you've made up several things. you got called out, embarrassed, and now you're just whining about it. bye kiddo

[2:54:23] beichunyue: 好兄弟！干死暴雪！
[2:54:24] BLRKnight: Base, delete addons and make normal boses where you not need 200 weak auras to kill
[2:54:26] Cjpriest: @Tutpup bold assumption
[2:54:28] zenkodac: imagine complaining about addons 7 years ago and WAs were much more powerful
[2:54:30] synathos: @Maximum I'm a mythic raider and I would NOT play the game without ElvUI or WA.

[2:54:51] Welsy_: dont take my MRT
[2:54:52] Azikielboi: @Maximum addons allow people with more experience to keep track of more things, its a cognitive load multiplier, so even things like classes blizz makes harder in response @Maximum
[2:54:52] aMoteofCosmicTruth: recount has been deprecated for a decade PepeLaugh

[2:54:59] Timothy_Longshorts: such a boomer take
[2:55:00] streatmagic_gaming: @Maximum Wouldn't removing addons just mean you have to call more things in Raid? I mean the whole point of WAs in raid is to remove the cognitive load for the player right?

[2:55:41] BigTrout3: imagine thinking he meant "only combat addons"
[2:55:43] Zaisx: No monitors either
[2:55:43] StarShopping95: People also made this add ons because blizzard has failed to implement these things
[2:55:43] ThisIsAsabel: Past-ism take, "it was better back in the day, let's go back"
[2:55:43] Cakerinotv: @Maximum idk, I'd prefer everything to be done by blizzard, more immersive and stuff but theres no way in hell thats ever gonna happen, the qol of wa's are just insane, blizzard CANNOT recreate millions of hours of dev time
[2:55:44] ElderSeas: No you heard asmon. As soon as add-ons are deleted wow will get better. Add-ons are actively making blizz make the game worse ???????

[2:55:52] crucial1711: Limiting the depth of addons would be good, but outright getting rid of the sourcing of the community to fill the gaps they wish they already had is a terrrrrrible take.

[2:59:08] trentbail23: Make a serious of legendaries but make it so you can only wear ONE at a time. so its effectively your UNIQUE spec changing item.
[2:59:09] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: @Maximum it took me 16 weeks to collect thos f ing fragments for that axe kekw f this system
[2:59:09] Taytor: Legiondaries

[2:59:19] dundlen: i cant think of any time legendaries have actually felt how people want them to feel
[2:59:19] dirtydeus: legendaries just cost real life money now it’s garbage
[2:59:20] ElderSeas: All versions of legendaries and how you got them was bad. It's never been good and always felt bad
[2:59:20] Helo_KiX: yeah legion legendaries were fun but they sure weren't "legendary"
[2:59:20] Chewbracca: The WoD rings were nice

[2:59:30] SirScizor2020: Quest item drops from a boss that has a short queatline capped with a mage tower style fight that rewards a ledgendary
[2:59:30] Arcth_: legendary now is more a unique effect item, that a rare item
[2:59:31] TheItalianStallion321: no b/c i had my evoker staff for like 6 fuckin weeks wtf
[2:59:34] ErikJugend: Leggo should be from a cool, hard and long questline
[2:59:35] nothumbgamer_ttv: soul capacitator with legendary ring 😍😍
[2:59:36] HeffaBear: balancing around legendaries is what makes it suck
[2:59:37] MacKnDeez: so glaives
[2:59:37] Razdruid: thunderfury?
[2:59:39] spivet: you can make something feel legendary with a time machine but thats about it
[2:59:41] fatbotmgrrl: Until Legion - legendaries were only available to certain classes and if you didn't play that class you were SOL
[2:59:43] xeion_7: 1 drop per server
[2:59:43] ShowDUH: WoD Ring was fucking good
[2:59:44] zenkodac: everyone would hate that i think
[2:59:44] Diazanite: mop cloaks were sick imo
[2:59:45] jesterpots: it would cause so much babyrage
[2:59:46] Maruika: people would mald so hard
[2:59:49] spiritcheese: like a Magetower YEP
[2:59:49] BabyDunn: they kinda do that with very rare loot items right?
[2:59:49] thuntv: 3% drop on mythic only and have it op'ed
[2:59:50] Rafix1301: A triumphant roar echoes from atop the Seat of the Aspects as Nasz’uro, the Unbound Legacy is formed.
[2:59:50] docdoge: amanthul lol
[2:59:50] BlayzeRM: Jailer mace the real legendary

[3:00:00] seangelma: warglaives
[3:00:01] zubulluu: the amount of shit theyd get about not having it would be insane
[3:00:02] TheRealDivert: Rhok'delar felt more like a legendary than any recent legendaries.
[3:00:04] heffdogga: do evokers still use the claw?
[3:00:04] Themselves: jailer weapon EZ
[3:00:05] PvtCheese: @CloudyHS It indeed did. The first person to make Thunderfury on the server, no one knew what to expect. It was epic. You werent going to get it, but seeing the experience was cool
[3:00:07] Lyonidus: @BlayzeRM true
[3:00:08] Metaphix: hot take I liked the cloak
[3:00:09] Theliahh: guaranteed quest legendaries are garbo
[3:00:09] rpgonlyforme: i think they missed an opportunity this expac with the crafting revamp to have everyone be able to make their own "legendary" and upgrade it in a limited fashion throughou the expac
[3:00:10] Chaz1y: Everyone has to be special :)
[3:00:10] trentbail23: make them like a corrupted unique gem from POE that CHANGES your class depending where you put it.
[3:00:10] Missingiscool: legendaries should be at the end of mage towers
[3:00:13] N1xern: Well, it's always a case of "I want it, but I don't want anyone else to have it" @Maximum
[3:00:13] filos0phia: Legendaries should be something casuals can chase for and don't add a significant power increase, requiring secret quests or zones. Those would live on forever
[3:00:15] nisou033: wasn't dragon soul rogue leggo daggers amazing ?
[3:00:16] Niral1241: you should never tune a class around having the legendary like the fyrak axe and some classes
[3:00:17] valarbravoosi: "you have don't have a legendary but you grinded 30 hours of M+? bye"
[3:00:17] Churchtrill: make it only drop on highest difficulty but don't balance around it, let the people that clear mythic be OP
[3:00:18] misran: the most powerful legendary of the last few xpacks was gavel, it just wasn't orange xdd
[3:00:19] trevor_sub: i mean they did this  in Legion @Maximum trink off last boss of the raid
[3:00:20] BabyDunn: wut
[3:00:21] Sulm: The rng on warglaives sucked hard. My guild NEVER saw a drop after months of farming illidan
[3:00:21] Welsy_: what
[3:00:21] Themselves: ????????
[3:00:22] spiritcheese: HUH
[3:00:22] RoyalkubsTV: @Maximum your other alternative method would be make it 5% better with a 1% drop chance
[3:00:23] CloudyHS: ???
[3:00:24] Welsy_: fucking what
[3:00:26] aithran: ?????????????????

[3:00:31] Kipo14: That take is so bad
[3:00:31] GandelionWhite: ???????????????
[3:00:32] lastericalive: rohk’delar was the goat
[3:00:32] Azikielboi: he also wants the highest difficlty brought way down @Maximum
[3:00:33] Morayeden: Buy a boost 100%
[3:00:35] texazbandit: I mean idk are you able to use it in pvp?
[3:00:36] Themselves: asmongold would complain about that LOL
[3:00:37] Napknutt: that aint it
[3:00:38] BrandonAUS: so screw m+ players?
[3:00:38] winterr555: @Maximum Working towards legendaries as a guild is the best way imo, rewards effort and takes time but every guild can get 2-3
[3:00:38] ashla11: wasnt he just talking about removing mythic? or did I miss the point
[3:00:38] biffhh: bro forgot about m+
[3:00:38] Azikielboi: you ahve to take that into account
[3:00:39] spiritcheese: HUH so you force everyone to play mythic

[3:00:41] jamiboiy: nah because he also wants the boss nerfed to fuck
[3:00:41] BigCizzle: except for next tier, since he wants items to stay relevant
[3:00:41] JoaEUW: Only people getting CE gets legendarY WHAT?!?!?!
[3:00:42] Welsy_: He literally did a 180
[3:00:44] kotabraun: But he keeps saying the highest diff should be piss easy anyway?
[3:00:44] ProxySetting: one of my most beloved memories was going against the only rogue on my server with glaives in arena and stomping him into the dirt. Leggos goated
[3:00:45] yeyanow: Yes
[3:00:45] JoaEUW: Does he know how many people get CE
[3:00:45] avenira_qt: BRO RLY SAID JUST DESIGN IT FOR THE RACE TO WORLD FIRST PLAYERS
[3:00:45] nomcarver00: yeah.. he contradicts himself alot
[3:00:46] ImpalerV: bro im so tired of that guy man. literally clueless complainer react andy. that is all he is with a big army of cry babies
[3:00:47] Azikielboi: he wants classic
[3:00:48] SkrrtRussel: yes lol
[3:00:48] Clox9: Its a legendary
[3:00:48] bobtari: whats the point of the legendary if it's not gonna help you complete the hardest content
[3:00:49] fatbotmgrrl: And btw, many guilds and raid groups were destroyed by old legendary farming.  If your legendary holder left your guild you were screwed
[3:00:50] vynistrian: hes contradicted himself like 4 times
[3:00:50] Crystallize007: his chat is so fucking funny
[3:00:51] fokare: true honestly but he would hateeee if Lego only dropped from mythic fyrakk
[3:00:53] malvy1: @BrandonAUS yeah m+ bad BASED
[3:00:53] Aro725: If you made the raid easier though like he wants it wouldnt be hard to get
[3:00:56] Swyvle: is that not designing for the 1%, the exact thing he's arguing against?????
[3:00:57] torchedwood: man just does not recognise m+ in general
[3:00:58] gzok__: ah see you are asking for consistency from him so jthats ur problem max
[3:01:00] freehawk1: Yeah they would lose their mind, but he prob also wants to remove m+
[3:01:01] zenkodac: did shadowmourne really feel epic or was it just OP in the hands of the most OP classes at the end of wotlk?
[3:01:03] BabyDunn: it doesnt help blizz designs specs around the leggo
[3:01:04] kallisz: he doesnt support multiple difficulties either so his takes are weird in current state of the game
[3:01:04] JERAULT: asmongold wants his achievements in the form of gear he wont use instead of just feats of strength
[3:01:05] Missingiscool: that would be funny if they deleted all logs and m+ scores of anyone who has bis gear on the last boss
[3:01:06] dundlen: @maximum being insanely powerful because of a legendary, and being shit because your class is balanced around it and you dont have it, both suck for different reasons.
[3:01:06] MajorFrog225: yea if you're doing +30s lol
[3:01:06] vtech310: he wants to drop the skill cap and then he can do it and then it wouldnt matter
[3:01:08] Osterberg501: He can't even keep his opinions in line with his own opinions. Truly a take.
[3:01:09] ImpalerV: stupid takes BASED
[3:01:09] ItsNoyzTv: @malvy1 baseg
[3:01:09] iamjrs: he thinks up "true farming" takes on the spot regardless of past positions YEP
[3:01:10] Orange_SM: the problem with legos is they toon classes around them
[3:01:11] Cjpriest: but the fact legendaries are dropping from LFR and normal and heroic is stupid
[3:01:12] jtp787: he also wants raids as easy as classic so you have to factor that in
[3:01:15] whodatboizzzz: M+ doesnt exist lol
[3:01:17] Mitune: Yeah but in his world the M+ need for that wouldnt exist
[3:01:18] darkgigaz: He means that's how it will feel legendary
[3:01:21] adobegainz1: Most people do raids for mythic + i would guess
[3:01:23] MaxThaGr8: ye but he said to make raids easier so it would be comparatively easier to obtain
[3:01:24] torchedwood: he just want a time where m+ did not exists back
[3:01:24] Welsy_: he assumes m+ doesnt exist because he hasnt played the game properly since fucking legion
[3:01:27] Azikielboi: he also wants the highest difficlty brought way down @Maximum
[3:01:28] Blut103: yeah its a mega contradiction
[3:01:29] Elomith: Cosmetic legendary basically?
[3:01:31] yeyanow: Unfortunately rwf killed mythic plus Kek
[3:01:32] Turkeypitz: just make leggo's not usable in m+
[3:01:34] Dolas08: @Maximum blizzard tune classes with legendary in mind, your plate guys is crap compare to non-legendary classes
[3:01:36] Azikielboi: yeah exactly
[3:01:38] belfastcl: yep
[3:01:38] alarkin: sYe
[3:01:38] BurtikShaun: Pvp despairge
[3:01:40] Azikielboi: YEP
[3:01:44] Aro725: He would also just buy the boost like hes always done to get it
[3:01:45] StarShopping95: BASED Max bad
[3:01:45] gloomygl: He's just clueless
[3:01:46] Blut103: welfare legendaries ICANT
[3:01:47] mezmerized09: It needs to be easy lol
[3:01:47] fugawe7: once i have CE idgaf about gear
[3:01:49] Lenzoface: like myhtic fabel was such a gap to not have for m+ players not raiding jailer @maximum
[3:01:50] Lachithor: yea M+ has killed the "old" way of having/getting a leggo, and the new ways of getting one just sucks so just scrap them
[3:01:51] Spartany25: has to be combining for it to make sense
[3:01:53] alvesol: peak debate stream
[3:01:54] ImpalerV: hellfire citadel LMFAO
[3:01:55] みょせつ: yeah he has a totally unrelated to the real game visualization of it
[3:01:55] alarkin: Which is good, do that easier pog
[3:01:56] Theliahh: he's right tho
[3:01:56] i_Static: again it’s okay for him bc he would get carried until he got the weapon lol
[3:02:03] JERAULT: absolutely did not happen but go off king
[3:02:04] Welsy_: what
[3:02:06] burlin_: ah yes hellfire citadel
[3:02:09] huntercreeper54: yeah we started dropping legendaries after our 1st kill lol
[3:02:11] Harry_barry_larry: "welfare legendaries"???
[3:02:12] Line_0: You get legendaries so late that it doesn't matter for progress
[3:02:12] Qubuuuu: hfc <3
[3:02:12] zenkodac: dont make content for the 1% on another note make rewards just for the 1% , i just cant my brain is fried after these takes
[3:02:13] madhatterui: ?
[3:02:14] Clox9: this happened to me tbh
[3:02:18] malnourish_: that’s a player problem
[3:02:20] bjarkanthepoet: that would be true but the legendary drop rate wasnt raised until like week 15
[3:02:21] JERAULT: i raided mythic in HFC and nobody gave a shit about rings except tanks
[3:02:22] KyleEverett: I loved the cloak
[3:02:26] Niconatelver: fyrakk wep KEKW
[3:02:26] luixun: i cleared myth mop without having cloak xD
[3:02:26] HeffaBear: that is true, the cloak and the ring made it impossible to come in late
[3:02:27] The_Boctor: definitely was getting invited to heroic raids in mop without cloak
[3:02:28] Lamatastisch: I cleared hfc (on heroic) way before I got the ring and I started like 6 month late
[3:02:30] Metaphix: same
[3:02:35] Theliahh: the legendary cloaks were so lame
[3:02:39] SlowboLaggins: welfare legendary = an embellishment pretty much
[3:02:40] kamalotus: i kinda agree w that
[3:02:40] alvesol: shouldve weared a green shirt today to show ur the green flag in this take
[3:02:42] Camelbak21: People not getting invited to m+ cause no axe :)(
[3:02:42] Cakerinotv: but that also feels bad
[3:02:42] crucial1711: BRING BACK ARTIFACT RARITY
[3:02:43] gloomygl: I want to go back to Cata type legendary
[3:02:43] Aro725: Sure it is, its orange
[3:02:43] mezmerized09: so just make it epic instead KEKW
[3:02:44] RequisiteOfED: true but at that point it's just semantics
[3:02:46] BabyDunn: just make those items like artifacts in legion. not legendary but still bis overall
[3:02:46] RequisiteOfED: call it something else
[3:02:48] bayazijr: everyone who plays enough should absolutely get it
[3:02:48] mezmerized09: who really cares
[3:02:49] Yosty: They need another item type called something else
[3:02:49] Bubblehealftw: should be a few on a server thats it
[3:02:49] NickHotS: call it something else
[3:02:49] Cjpriest: not everyone should have it is his point. the fact i see twitter posts with 15 people getting the new axe from LFR is aids
[3:02:50] thuntv: yes thats why it has to be very rare
[3:02:50] Frilner: Bring back fishing up Ashbringer
[3:02:52] gigaerick: they just need to make a new tier for those types of "legendaries"
[3:02:53] BrandonAUS: people will start inviting based on that more than they already do
[3:02:56] fatbotmgrrl: The WoD ring was literally a quest chain
[3:02:56] Celestial990: Doesnt work in current state of WoW/year
[3:02:57] wonkus1: just make it a rare ass skin in 2024 thats the only actual solution
[3:02:58] YugeCrit: entitled gamers
[3:02:58] MadhatterMB: just make it only mythic drop
[3:02:59] DeeterDo: just make legendaries expansion wide useful, not this per patch bullshit
[3:02:59] vanicax: hunters in season 1 WTH bow u had to have for mythic plus high keys
[3:03:01] docdoge: literally amanthul's where it doesnt matter since it doesnt drop
[3:03:01] zannuss: So then we are back to the original legendary drops from vanilla and tbc
[3:03:01] seangelma: warglaives were so good you used it the next tier
[3:03:02] Welsy_: We cant have exceptionally strong items in the game that take a long time and a lot of effort to get. IT breaks the game.
[3:03:03] tanikins: more rare, but also don't tune a class around that power level
[3:03:03] the_great_simonator: if it was more rare it would be aweful cuz I won't get it
[3:03:04] BobAwesome: The only thing legendary about it, is how much it sucks.
[3:03:04] Line_0: Yeah it's not too interesting anymore
[3:03:05] Metaphix: hot take legion legos were cool
[3:03:05] PvtCheese: I like the Legos that are part of the lore, not tied to getting in Raid/etc. Doing world stuff for it.
[3:03:08] spivet: it would be like d4 uber uniques. more people mad about the drop rate than happy about getting it
[3:03:09] yeyanow: The game has outgrown the legendary gimmick
[3:03:12] Scriix: personally i enjoyed the artifact weapons in legion
[3:03:13] Welsy_: The way to make legendaries impactful is through lore. Nothing else.
[3:03:14] talkley: and then you have to pay like 500k or something for it to be crafted???
[3:03:14] freehawk1: @Maximum But Asmon doesn't want patches anymore he wants the legendary to be useful whole expansion
[3:03:14] ashla11: legendaries that are built by guild are such bullshit, guild makes a legendary -> player immediately leaves for better guild
[3:03:15] filos0phia: make legendaries Aspirational content
[3:03:15] Drows95: glaives was pure rng
[3:03:15] deadie3D: make it a skin only for every class for every tier
[3:03:15] noirlol: insane glaives
[3:03:16] vaironixx: warglaives were awesome
[3:03:18] Shurafna: they were crazy good
[3:03:19] audrock7: I like vegan fried clam sandwiches
[3:03:19] Cjpriest: @Metaphix not even a chance
[3:03:20] AufzumAtem: The problem is if its build enabling
[3:03:22] ErikJugend: Dropped legendaries sucks ass
[3:03:22] DeyrFe_: I’ve already mogged off of Fyr’alath lol
[3:03:23] Bubblehealftw: used to be that 1 guy on a server that had em
[3:03:23] bigsemit: he's going to say the same thing about the warglaives
[3:03:24] Goodnevi1: The problem is tbe classes are tuned around you having them
[3:03:24] mezmerized09: Even Asmon fans wouldn't like that
[3:03:26] zannuss: man, I got my glaives like 5 years apaart
[3:03:26] Chewbracca: Legendaries not lasting for an entire expansion is fucking stupid
[3:03:27] Biscuitpaw: 100% they are. the amount of people crying because they didn't get the fyra leggo week 1 is insane
[3:03:27] Basic_3: Deactivate legendaries in M+ then?
[3:03:29] Turkeypitz: @Maximum Xaryu made a cool comment - back in the day, you didn't care that people did naxx or lich king, when you (as a normie) didn't - it was cool to know people did - one key change - people now expect to be able to do the best or get the best
[3:03:29] grimzero617: It feels weird to hear complaints about people that play all professionally when he also plays games professionally
[3:03:30] gloomygl: Tarecgosa's Rest was a real fucking legendary
[3:03:30] zubulluu: just get rid of legendaries, theyre outdated as fuck
[3:03:31] Tachygraphy: Ashes of a'lar would be cool if there was a differnt method instead of just drops
[3:03:32] MajorFrog225: mythic suncaller is my leggo
[3:03:34] ThebluesBilly: warglaives was like 1% drop right?
[3:03:37] Scriix: in TBC my guild had 7! off hands and never saw a mainhand drop
[3:03:39] crucial1711: I think they should swap to the iconic system from cyberpunk, make it rare, make it not too easy to get, but once you get it you just can maintain it throughout the tier or expansion
[3:03:40] texazbandit: @brandonaus if you don’t have a high rating you ain’t getting an invite so most normal have to make a group themselves or just miss out
[3:03:41] SlowboLaggins: @ashla11 i think the popularity contest portion of that is the problem
[3:03:48] JimmyNashville: why is Max watching Greta Thunberg talk about WoW?
[3:03:53] zenkodac: guilds died for the warglaives , do you really weant that back
[3:03:59] TaschenlurchWoW: got evoker legendary after 34 weeks... I didnt get it in season 2 at all
[3:03:59] zenkodac: want*
[3:04:01] Larshouma: Warglaves were so good that Reckful used to use them on Lichking Expansion even though it was 70s items
[3:04:01] Azikielboi: YEP 󠀀
[3:04:04] noirlol: ye people are fkinng entitled, its crazy
[3:04:04] malvy1: HAH
[3:04:05] vaironixx: @JimmyNashville atpRtsd
[3:04:06] Line_0: All gamers want the best in all games
[3:04:07] yeahp0n: that's player entitlement
[3:04:15] CloudyHS: Kappa
[3:04:15] beichunyue: 干死暴雪！
[3:04:16] Maruika: HUH
[3:04:20] neverfourRS: osrs is the same way with maxing or getting 99s in skills everyone wants it and they want it easier than it used to be
[3:04:21] forphium: i don't remember anyone complaining about raelshalare or w/e hunter bow from sod, but maybe I just don't listen to hunters?
[3:04:22] Jnxz: atiesh  <3
[3:04:23] Maruika: valanyr was probably close to the top
[3:04:25] gigaerick: he's definitely cooking for sure, idk if it's burnt but it's cooking
[3:04:25] mezmerized09: did he just say Atiesh??
[3:04:25] belfastcl: not sure if it's a thing in every mmo
[3:04:27] kotabraun: Warglaives is just a drop tho
[3:04:29] gloomygl: wow, people don't have the same expectations 20 years apart, how surprising !
[3:04:30] adobegainz1: FEEL THE BITE OF FYR'ALATH IS A GOATED LEGGO IDGAF
[3:04:38] zenkodac: his talking about classic tbc not og tbc
[3:04:39] cornflakezza: Paladin get buffed and legendary get also buffed
[3:04:39] valkor_10: Hand of Rag?
[3:04:40] itsnozadru: Thunderfury
[3:04:41] vaironixx: thunderfury come on
[3:04:42] Welsy_: warglaives is literally an RNG drop
[3:04:42] gloomygl: TARECGOSA
[3:04:43] CloudyHS: BBoomer
[3:04:43] Turkeypitz: 100% all these issue are 'Us' - sucks that companies feel they need to cater to everyone - I wonder how many great ideas we miss out on?
[3:04:43] Tarthris: BBoomer
[3:04:44] ImpalerV: Atiesh was only good because of how you would acquire it lmao
[3:04:44] talkley: so two just drops? okay
[3:04:46] ELG_Chief: THE OLD DAYS
[3:04:46] FrilleJr: old = good
[3:04:47] Tereekel: Exactly, entitled players just want anything handed to them because they play the game without having to get good at it lol
[3:04:47] TheItalianStallion321: DID SOMEONE SAY THUNDERFURY?
[3:04:48] LegendofOrin: he completely left os shadowmorne though
[3:04:48] Sulm: wasn't the bow terrible? lol
[3:04:50] Arcinatos: MOP CLOAK WAS AWESOME i will stand by that
[3:04:50] hotmanpop: back when the game was good BBoomer
[3:04:51] SpaEngi: Thunderfury Pog
[3:04:52] Colaja953: BBoomer
[3:04:53] Metaphix: whats the difference between atiesh and valanyr
[3:04:53] muffe100: OLD = GOOD NEW = BAD :(
[3:04:53] yeyanow: Yeah, but looking back at tbc and trying to get started and no one would look at you.
[3:04:53] zannuss: lol everyone had to have glaives, those didnt drop that often
[3:04:54] ErikJugend: Just win the 3% drop rate, so cool
[3:04:54] jamiboiy: he takes every opportunity to seem knowledgeable LUL
[3:04:56] Quiznuhtodd: Bro naming old legendary because he don't know the recent ones
[3:04:57] Ariesui: what about the sylvanas bow
[3:04:58] TheSHAYdynasty: what if its a single player endeavor and its really hard, like a mage tower but way harder, so when you see someone have a lego, you know they deserve / good
[3:04:59] civiinn: bro not having warglaives and watching others do 20% more damage purely because they had them was the worst feeling ever
[3:04:59] dundlen: welfare legendries ruined old legendries, but purely because of people's attitudes changing in response
[3:05:00] od3x: Ö-tier take
[3:05:01] lastericalive: valanyr
[3:05:03] grozzarr: did someone say thundefury?
[3:05:03] BrandonAUS: asmon is living in nostalgia land hard
[3:05:04] Razdruid: wasnt thunderfury cracked?
[3:05:05] ashla11: @SlowboLaggins it is also that but like, talk to a classic player for mor ethen 5 minutes and they will complain about someone getting x item then leaving
[3:05:06] zenkodac: and the warglaives didnt?
[3:05:06] vaironixx: thunderfury was one of THE COOLEST legendaries
[3:05:06] azm07: hes just old man who cannot let go past when he was young and succesfull at the game
[3:05:07] Toketems: Toketems subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! yooo let’s go 1 year
[3:05:08] CapriSunny_D: it'd be like if The Office was released today, it would be cancelled. People ruin everything
[3:05:08] LegendofOrin: Shadowmorne was a perfect legendary
[3:05:08] Missingiscool: super rare and legit legendaries would be restricted from competitive content
[3:05:11] oonanilord: @beichunyue max 在反驳asmongold的观点，你想要干死暴雪的话你得去asmon直播间看
[3:05:14] Protoman_702: tfury is by far the sicket legendary thing give you infinte aoe threat, thunderclap, and was big dam lasted from mc and was still being used in raids in bc until its thunderclap effect was nurfed
[3:05:20] gloomygl: LMAOOOOO
[3:05:21] ruzzlestwitch: so syl bow is one of the best legendaries then ?
[3:05:21] NotD4k: KEKW
[3:05:22] mezmerized09: L Take ROFL
[3:05:23] Arcinatos: LOOOOOL
[3:05:23] Blut103: BANNED lmaooo
[3:05:24] waelrick: LUL
[3:05:25] kreyzy8: PepeLaugh
[3:05:25] Cozo_TV: how is atiesh great but not shadowmourn ?
[3:05:27] CoreytheP: hahahahah
[3:05:28] Swyvle: parsing should be banned LMFAO
[3:05:29] JERAULT: huh
[3:05:29] SlowboLaggins: KEKW
[3:05:29] jesuslouise: wow arena is raid 5Head
[3:05:29] cornflakezza: hahaha
[3:05:32] Morayeden: Classic andies gotta go
[3:05:32] Veszyx_: Does Asmongold have denchers? When he looks to the side he looks like he has like a set of costume teeth in his mouth.
[3:05:34] noirlol: Cheergi Cheergi
[3:05:34] mezmerized09: Hide your logs if you're so scared Asmon KEKW
[3:05:35] Welsy_: just close the video now please KEKW
[3:05:35] madhatterui: when was the last time he played retail?
[3:05:37] ImpalerV: wow arena is raid cant wait
[3:05:40] MajorFrog225: didn't you just agree with not caring about parsing?
[3:05:40] ThebluesBilly: @Maximum valanyr was the worst to farm, you feed 10 weeks someone for him to leave
[3:05:40] darkyzee: KEKW
[3:05:42] Theliahh: fyralath is a best case scenario for a legendary I think except maybe the bad luck protection should ramp up a little sooner
[3:05:43] bayazijr: Parsing is a fun minigame for reclears why does everyone make fun of it
[3:05:44] huntercreeper54: if wow is too much for him why not just stop playing?
[3:05:47] talkley: @Veszyx_ yeah he lost a bunch to tooth rot
[3:05:47] yeyanow: Isn't raiding still really popular? Like way more people raid now?
[3:05:47] zenkodac: shadowmorne is what we have now, random drop with a quest chain to upgrade it
[3:05:48] OspreyRed: oh boy he cookin
[3:05:50] Maruika: didnt he also say he wants old tier gear to carry over, now its a n issue with legos
[3:05:51] kallisz: not if you have a proper guild
[3:05:52] gmike66: 1.5 speed
[3:05:54] N1xern: Again, that's not wows fault
[3:05:55] gloomygl: I'm not gonna lie I didn't make it past 15 minutes in that video
[3:05:58] 1204955507: @Veszyx_ yeah all his teeth are fake
[3:05:58] soccerflow11: he did m+ with the cats last season
[3:05:58] dritotv: so he doesnt want to be excluded but doesnt want welfare legendaries
[3:06:01] vaironixx: @huntercreeper54 guy barely plays now, so yeah
[3:06:01] Taytor: Asmon is right. Literally noone brought a 2h str user to raid untill they had the legendary. That definatley happened
[3:06:04] GenXGamerDad: then maybe he should move on to another game then...but he is getting a lot of content out of this
[3:06:08] Razdruid: SAME
[3:06:11] mezmerized09: I literally cannot imagine trying to pug m+ or a raid without RIO or Logs
[3:06:13] crucial1711: Well you either have exclusivity or you don't. People basically say they want the benefit of luxury without paying for it.
[3:06:18] ThebluesBilly: @zenkodac shadowmourne was not random
[3:06:19] Letholas: they did it with the evoker thing

[3:06:28] zannuss: No one was expected to have sulfuras, thunderfury, or glaives to do raids
[3:06:32] mezmerized09: Absolutely, everyone woudl hate it
[3:06:36] Syghtless: i remember gettign my mop cloak, loved it
[3:06:37] Mealkey: they kind of did that with the evoker thing and it was annoying
[3:06:50] N1xern: Well, it's always going to be a case of "I want it, but I don't want anyone else to have it" @Maximum
[3:06:51] zerossussy: @welsy_ yea

[3:07:01] spivet: which is exactly what happened in classic
[3:07:01] GearzxGaming: absolutely
[3:07:03] gmike66: isnt that how legendarys are now? we have to wait for your guild to kill the boss to unlock it for everyone else lol kinda bad design right there
[3:07:05] Morayeden: I feel like that now wiht the aze
[3:07:05] RurryDiff: Ight magetower legendary
[3:07:09] donpapaa: Yeeeee
[3:07:09] Krunklock: only way they would work is if they were Cosmetic Legendaries
[3:07:09] Tereekel: It's sad that people just want stuff because it exists but they don't want to put effort into attaining them
[3:07:10] Missingiscool: you would need them to do the best possible if they were bis
[3:07:10] RurryDiff: BAM
[3:07:12] phont_: this happens with even just trinkets these days
[3:07:12] The_Boctor: people poached the fuck out of people with glaives lmao
[3:07:15] dakila24: people would be malding that their parse was 2% lower than someone with the legendary lol

[3:07:18] GooseComics: Thats me now as a Ret paladin STILL without the leggo Axe.
[3:07:19] Shredwot: true
[3:07:19] Melati: You don't need the current legendary and people think that
[3:07:24] kallisz: you see this now, palas and warrior without legos are dogshir
[3:07:25] Welsy_: I just rerolled lol
[3:07:26] xHitchcock: that sucked
[3:07:27] spiritcheese: BLUBBERS i don´t get it week´s along
[3:07:27] LightsHamer: there all whole sights now dedicated to telling you the best gear and build in the game. See things like Maxroll.
[3:07:27] Newlander: Make it into a tmog then. Purely cosmetic. Make it bad ass tho
[3:07:27] Metaphix: i didnt get my BIS till TOS KEKW
[3:07:30] nemziac: some of us only did after the bug was fixed
[3:07:30] Tooyoo: Fyra'lath rage
[3:07:32] Razdruid: look at Critcake. he talked like he was dogshit because of no legendary and hes one of the best warriors in the world
[3:07:32] trentbail23: class quest should drop different legendries every season but only let you wear one at a time. they could be transformative and interesting.
[3:07:33] Llarrow: I got sat cause my fist leggo was Saphuzas secrect :)
[3:07:33] Protips: It took our evoker like 22 weeks to get sark leggo. And we all heard about it every week KEKW
[3:07:33] BobAwesome: Legion legendaries sucked balls.
[3:07:33] carbonstylus: i got my fire bracers last back when i was polaying. it was AWFUL
[3:07:34] Streetside0: @Maximum also if people dont expect you to have the legendary even worse classes are tuned around having the lego
[3:07:40] Gorakk82: i hope they do legion classic with better lego acquisition
[3:07:41] yeahp0n: yeah it was rough. making an alt of the same class was smarter
[3:07:43] Squats3: @maximum you can see that RIGHT NOW. this lego sucks and people still are angry they don't have it
[3:07:45] Shredwot: people thing
[3:07:47] cashzilla: getting sephuz first was such a depressing experience lmao
[3:07:49] Thasin22: Prolly should just make them cosmetic now
[3:07:50] crucial1711: @Protips yeah same here, tier was almost over by the time i got it.
[3:07:50] xHitchcock: buddy got bis legendary like right away and i never saw mine before i gave up
[3:07:52] huntercreeper54: got prydaz and sephuz 1st week as a holy priest i was in heaven (no)
[3:07:52] meozart: asmon talk from a pugs point of view because he is a pug he wants content raids and bosses so he can clear in one day and move on @maximum
[3:07:53] zenkodac: ThebluesBilly true but you had to farm shard for weeks and unless your guild prioed you you were taking a while if ever
[3:07:59] Jovent2: @Maximum There's 0.1 as well tho, even if you kill mythic fyrakk you could still use the weapon/still need it
[3:07:59] Missingiscool: this tiers legendary was balanced around before anyone got it tho it is different now
[3:08:03] oonanilord: @beichunyue max是暴雪专业洗白户，我实在想不清这些人在这里还在硬给暴雪解释啥
[3:08:09] Noshpan: I didn't get a Legion legendary for my Druid until 4-6 months into the expansion & it wasn't even bis.
[3:08:11] zubulluu: If legion happened now, even casuals would have multiple of the same class trying to get their best lego
[3:08:12] Madgeneto: @Gorakk82 just play legion private realms
[3:08:15] aithran: 5 years LMAO
[3:08:20] zerossussy: @gorakk82 no meme legion would be boring with a better legion acquisition
[3:08:20] BrandonAUS: 5 years is probably the last time he really played lol
[3:08:20] Spartany25: Poor Dobi, this was suppossed to be about his post, not Asmons takes
[3:08:23] Welsy_: 80% is bloat lol
[3:08:24] grimzero617: true AND real? Wow

[3:08:28] zerossussy: legendary*
[3:08:30] mezmerized09: KEKW
[3:08:31] SniggleJake572: KEKW
[3:08:32] DeathlyRaiser: As someone who pugged as an Evoker a lot in of H Aberrus, nobody cared if you had the leggo or not, just do some good dps and get loot
[3:08:33] Celestial990: Tbf being a quality post on the wow forums is a low bar
[3:08:35] Sathenus: He knows..... nothing
[3:08:35] Stephy_Mariee: a lot of BabyRage
[3:08:36] GearzxGaming: yap
[3:08:37] Razdruid: PLOT TWIST. HE WROTE IT
[3:08:38] Madgeneto: @zerossussy except everyone agrees on last patch being the only good one
[3:08:38] malavander: hyperbolehyperbolehyperbole
[3:08:41] Line_0: It wasn't bad
[3:08:42] aMoteofCosmicTruth: the addon part in the post talks about making the base UI better not removing addons
[3:08:45] Welsy_: The post couldve been 10 bullet points tbh
[3:08:46] richie918: this whole DF patch is stale
[3:08:47] Lif3l3ss: Idk if it feels any worse then being balanced as a 2h str user around a weapon and just barely getting the weapon im balanced around this late into a patch.
[3:08:49] ImpalerV: a truckload of shit takes
[3:08:50] zannuss: I think they should stop making legendaries and just make rare cosmetic only drops like the polearms from argus or the sword from aggramar
[3:08:51] kallisz: asmon has built his hivemind for years and years and he sadly doesnt understand a lot of things anymore
[3:08:53] mezmerized09: @Celestial990 Lmao exactly, extremely low
[3:08:55] noirlol: ICANT
[3:08:55] Destrolisher: just make the boss right 4Head
[3:09:00] ElderSeas: Asmongolds video is entirely performative. He doesn't think about or care about any of this stuff
[3:09:01] ImpalerV: a truckload of shit takes from a react andy that was never good at raiding
[3:09:03] yeyanow: You would never make bosses then
[3:09:03] zenkodac: there is like 2 good paragraphs in that wall of text
[3:09:06] Taytor: Just makei t right KEKW
[3:09:07] CloudyHS: Dentge
[3:09:07] gloomygl: he just wants classic
[3:09:08] oonanilord: no way bruh
[3:09:08] cornflakezza: When I hear Asmon talking and plan to start as a new player, I immediately look for another game
[3:09:09] mezmerized09: What kind of take is that KEKW
[3:09:10] Pyra2366: just design game good lgwSmart
[3:09:11] burlin_: that is literally just buy a house logic
[3:09:11] zerossussy: @madgeneto yea it was the best one i agree, but every expansion’s last patch is always great
[3:09:12] gloomygl: fuck off LMAO
[3:09:12] mezmerized09: bro what
[3:09:13] Gorakk82: bosses would become very stale
[3:09:16] Morayeden: Fuckthat
[3:09:17] Welsy_: He is okay with bosses never being killed?
[3:09:18] Madgeneto: FF14 ASS TAKE KEKW
[3:09:18] stenpotatis: JUST MAKE THE GAME PERFECT - Asmongold
[3:09:18] gzok__: I would not play Asmon's MMO
[3:09:20] 2Bs_tasty_feet: Who let this man cook
[3:09:21] Laluzmia: LOL
[3:09:21] LegendofOrin: asmon reminds meof rick from rick and morty
[3:09:23] Clindo_: Just be perfect at game design
[3:09:23] shawnydoodle: he thinks vanilla takes skill, thats his problem, it just takes time lol
[3:09:24] nellfin: this is how he will delete the playerbase
[3:09:25] rottisxd: so raid leaders
[3:09:26] darkyzee: Bro just broke wow
[3:09:26] vaironixx: asmon out of touch takes, classic
[3:09:27] SlowboLaggins: @Lif3l3ss and having it be a meh weapon on top of it all
[3:09:28] kallisz: its like saying no games should be modded, its insane
[3:09:29] huntercreeper54: wtf automate gameplay?
[3:09:29] sabaron: basically he would go out of business in record time
[3:09:30] Mtkx11: just perfectly balance the bosses. can’t be that hard
[3:09:33] BrandonAUS: Lot of players suck with addons.. can you imagine them without
[3:09:33] gigaerick: he's just so blinded by nostalgia he just wants it to be like classic again
[3:09:33] bayazijr: Asmongold would do a lot of things, and successfully kill WoW as he clearly wants to
[3:09:35] spiritcheese: HUH
[3:09:36] Metaphix: bagnon ruined the game bro
[3:09:37] ayoSwis: WoW would die without addons imo
[3:09:39] GearzxGaming: So he wants to quite literally go back to 2004, not just classic wow
[3:09:39] zenkodac: asmon should make his own mmo and see how popular it is
[3:09:39] yeyanow: Fuck people with accessibility issues I guess
[3:09:44] zannuss: I have to wear glasses to play the game, is that considered an addon?
[3:09:44] Ristvakbaen1911: He was cookin' but he burnt some of it
[3:09:44] gloomygl: agreed, court of stars was so annoying
[3:09:46] glorkwimp: nymue says hello
[3:09:46] adobegainz1: We playing wow back in 2004 it seems
[3:09:47] Elder_Penguin: What perfect game is this mfer playing?
[3:09:49] genjuro: he is doing automated quests in that relink game during this hehe
[3:09:50] Xanctius: Nooo, I like my Ultra wide monitor!
[3:09:52] Basic_3: People complaining about Nymue without fighting it
[3:09:52] quorra112: nymue kekw
[3:09:52] DomiThay: whys he complaining about the game being too "automated" when he plays auto play games..
[3:09:52] Welsy_: fuck bagnon bro
[3:09:53] andaroo: Nymue is pretty hard for me to make out, but it's 1 boss
[3:09:56] ComicsWoW: people are just blind
[3:09:56] Sithandra_Li: That was a big trigger for D4 also
[3:09:56] Fannypackk: fuck bagnon straight up
[3:09:58] Big_Mikk: nymue
[3:09:59] malvy1: yeah way les,, only ever raid
[3:10:03] Rhop: Transparity KEKW
[3:10:04] Thdlock: 💿
[3:10:04] MajorFrog225: that vast majority of good games have 0 addons
[3:10:06] Line_0: Yeah visual clarity over theme for me
[3:10:08] Lightningnic: trans parody
[3:10:09] Sathenus: buttt..... blizzard WILL NEVER do it
[3:10:10] SniggleJake572: @Elder_Penguin he doesnt play games, just talks
[3:10:13] maplelost: green circle is a theme
[3:10:14] winterr555: @Maximum It's because of how bad it is when it does happen, so when it happens again it's extremely tilting and it just gets exponential
[3:10:16] isFeyz: @DomiThay cause wow = bad is something his audience loves
[3:10:17] Lif3l3ss: @SlowboLaggins yep
[3:10:21] zubulluu: That should literally never happen ever though lol, zero excuse for that kind of stuff to exist
[3:10:22] zukohonor: fuck that
[3:10:24] dubbyatt: 💿
[3:10:28] mezmerized09: Uh its so bad KEKW
[3:10:28] KlKlDlKl: removing addons would ruin so many casual raiding guilds. which is a large percentage of the playerbase
[3:10:30] omgwatlol: red = bad, green = good; don't care about roleplay
[3:10:31] Thdlock: HOT FIRE IS BLUE
[3:10:32] malavander: no reason fx can't be more opaque, crisp and vibrant though
[3:10:34] duel00: but blue fire is hotter
[3:10:36] valarbravoosi: just do frost-fire 4Head
[3:10:36] Starforkx: @DomiThay dont tell him that
[3:10:38] Madgeneto: @Thdlock no
[3:10:40] LegendofOrin: a big red fire guy can have a blue floor though
[3:10:42] Silencbank: well, a fire guy MIGHT make blue if the fire is really hot
[3:10:43] zenkodac: i wouldnt mind them compromising a bit more on that for sure, make mechanics more defined and less "immersive"
[3:10:43] calsu62: sarkareth was pretty hard for me to visually navigate
[3:10:50] Mitune: yeah but at a point gameplay needs to be more important that theme
[3:10:51] rami_rng: but that shouldnt be a problem with swirlies , fuck the ability partice dont you think
[3:10:51] mezmerized09: My name is Dylon and I spit hot fiyuh
[3:10:54] spivet: top down design, mtg is the same way
[3:10:55] Basic_3: It's called "top down" design
[3:10:56] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: @Maximum  bro fire can be multiple colours kekw
[3:10:57] Big_Mikk: the floor don't have to be red too
[3:11:01] Robohobbo: TENTACLES??
[3:11:03] Rey40fp: Other games don't need addons. Why does WoW do? Im a casual and every time I wanna go back to WoW the thought of setting up addons scares me
[3:11:04] foobis_25: thundering
[3:11:06] donutboyj: lol, soak tiny red orbs, in huge fire, in huge fire arena and huge fire boss, absolute dog design
[3:11:09] Arcinatos: PogChamp 🤙 PUUUUUURPLE
[3:11:13] crucial1711: WORST AFFIX EVER MADE
[3:11:13] Mewn: what other game comes even close to the amount of third party addons that alter and guide gameplay
[3:11:13] Niconatelver: pepeMeltdown
[3:11:19] CapriSunny_D: prideful
[3:11:19] MajorFrog225: affixes suck cock
[3:11:21] spivet: @Rey40fp you don't need any. come back and play 0 addons you'll have fun
[3:11:22] mezmerized09: @Rey40fp If you're a casual you really dont need to worry about addons
[3:11:23] AgentAntwan: Bring back G'huunies LUL
[3:11:25] zenkodac: Rey40fp you can start playing without them
[3:11:26] Madgeneto: @sir_jaaahrl_gaming no shit, but then it's a firework not a fire lord
[3:11:27] fronkacean: @Rey40fp many other games need addons, the real answer is "because they've had it for 20 years"
[3:11:27] aMoteofCosmicTruth: nor how color cohesion works. his fixis red on green on purple
[3:11:29] fronkacean: u cant take it away now
[3:11:32] Mezzedii: what would the jailer player for mdi mhm
[3:11:32] BabyDunn: it makes sense from an intial design perspective
[3:11:33] Therealbrokensword: @Rey40fp wow doesnt need addons
[3:11:34] ElderSeas: @maximum but why is that. Why not start from great gameplay and then skin it to be thematic? Their approach seems ass backwards
[3:11:34] BlayzeRM: I miss seasonal affixes
[3:11:34] WolfgangAmpersand: @Rey40fp Thats the thing, you dont need the addon too. You can do it perfectly.
[3:11:36] SniggleJake572: @Rey40fp are u also scared to go outside?
[3:11:36] gloomygl: I think Theme should stay the priority.
[3:11:39] valarbravoosi: can you imagine if Azshara's Commands was a M+ affix back in BFA? (stop moving, keep moving stack, spread)
[3:11:39] adobegainz1: BRING BACK S4 SHADOWLANDS AFFIXES
[3:11:39] zukohonor: thats so dogshit it hurts my head
[3:11:41] LoonerFlare: pyrooZod pyrooHyd PURPLE
[3:11:43] 2Bs_tasty_feet: monkaHmm What would the jailer do if he was in my dungeon group
[3:11:44] Teshinator95: you dont have to have that different a colour, just have solid colours, and defined edges...
[3:11:46] nothumbgamer_ttv: Sinful <3
[3:11:46] Cakerinotv: honestly it needs to be
[3:11:57] Line_0: I think they need to go towards that tbh
[3:11:58] LoonerFlare: @valarbravoosi I would absolutely hate my life
[3:12:03] spivet: sometimes it leads to sire and everything looks fuckin sick
[3:12:05] bosseja: 1 out of 7 adds
[3:12:07] neugassh: but it looks like complete dogass you only see addons
[3:12:08] avenira_qt: theres a huge middle ground between making the fire blue tho on the red boss
[3:12:11] kallisz: it can be on theme and change it a little more sometimes
[3:12:16] richie918: PopNemo
[3:12:17] cornflakezza: Blizzard Need only 2 things Bann bots and stop Player selling raids for better rnd inv
[3:12:18] MorandoTv: why not have it be an option then for wildstar like reticles?
[3:12:18] gloomygl: 40 players please no
[3:12:21] Rafix1301: damn that no addon guy got smoked
[3:12:21] spiritcheese: @Rey40fp thats a L take. for 2-3 add ons not playing the game is kind of bad. details and dbm no more needed . so no argument
[3:12:21] Bigace1116: Yup
[3:12:22] fatlittlepaypig: he bitches about everything and doesnt even play the game anymore
[3:12:23] crucial1711: Bosses would require SIGNIFICANTLY more development time to create a challenging boss that isn't reticle based and has good enough tells for its attack patterns.
[3:12:23] kallisz: 40 man raiding is also CRAZY
[3:12:24] valarbravoosi: @LoonerFlare imagine a holy priest and suddenly "keep moving" KEKW
[3:12:24] donpapaa: YYYY
[3:12:24] zenkodac: 100%
[3:12:25] BrandonAUS: 100%
[3:12:26] Mitune: the easier the content the less it matter but the more punishing the content the more its important to see the stuff
[3:12:28] LoonerFlare: oh you fucking know he would
[3:12:28] 0rektquiem: theres a way to keep in with the "theme" but at the same time not have it be visually shit and bad gameplay wise i think
[3:12:29] Docaan: Bet your coffee machine
[3:12:29] MajorFrog225: 100 man raid
[3:12:35] nanerpus_: He would complain about the "pussification" of the game if they made it easier
[3:12:37] gloomygl: 1000 man raid
[3:12:39] LoonerFlare: He would instantly complain how it doesnt look real
[3:12:40] nate54881: yeah his whole business model is complaining about the game
[3:12:40] nanerpus_: thats a word he likes to use
[3:12:42] Xanctius: 40 man raids killed wildstar
[3:12:44] RurryDiff: thats how he makes content
[3:12:45] N1xern: 40 man can f*** right off
[3:12:46] Basic_3: The point isn't having good opinions, it's being a rage merchant.
[3:12:47] Blut103: gatekeeping what an mmo should be is crazy
[3:12:48] freezyxxd: gl finding 40 people to raid 2-3 days a week consistantly
[3:12:48] nyshindysheen: 100man for sure
[3:12:49] PvtCheese: 40 man raids would kill wow. Can barely find 20 decent people.
[3:12:50] Starforkx: 40 man raid in 2024 = literally no one raids
[3:12:50] Cakerinotv: thats such a wild take
[3:12:52] Madgeneto: this is such a petty, trash player catering take KEKW he sounds like he's in an electoral campaign
[3:12:52] mfalc: thats false
[3:12:52] maplelost: Contrarian without a cause
[3:12:52] sabaron: ????????
[3:12:53] RowanWeir: if it's an unpopular opinion than maybe it wouldn't be better for the majority of players lmao
[3:12:53] Welsy_: not true
[3:12:53] GrimFandango: ?????????????????
[3:12:54] Onyd: Onyd subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:12:55] Taytor: ??????????
[3:12:55] BobAwesome: I don't mind a bosses mechanics matching their aesthetic. It's the lake of defined edges and the environment being way too similar in colors.
[3:12:55] spiritcheese: HUH
[3:12:55] kotabraun: HUH
[3:12:55] dundlen: thats not how that works
[3:12:55] gloomygl: HUH

[3:13:00] i_Static: he’s just making shit up now
[3:13:00] Mealkey: what are negative framerates?
[3:13:02] BrandonAUS: sounds like asmon has a skill issue and wants baby mode
[3:13:02] DasAutoChat: easy for him to say when he could fill a 40 man raid LUL
[3:13:02] fatlittlepaypig: it means nothing
[3:13:02] warnopoly: wow
[3:13:02] Sathenus: YET HE WANTS 40 MAN RAIDS
[3:13:03] Razdruid: too flashy?
[3:13:03] KlKlDlKl: MMOs arnt inherently competitive?
[3:13:03] aithran: i'm losing IQ faster than i can count
[3:13:03] MrColvr: and then he says he wants 40 man raids...
[3:13:03] burlin_: game looking good = bad
[3:13:03] goulashnihao: just make the game boring
[3:13:04] Niconatelver: yappin yap yap
[3:13:04] vaironixx: asmon literally just talks to hear himself talk
[3:13:04] talkley: I think if you took every player in retail wow who wanted 40 man raids and put them in one you wouldn’t fill the raid @maximum
[3:13:04] zenkodac: he lives in a magic wonderland of his own imagination
[3:13:05] nightst314: it's a new buzzword he learned
[3:13:05] goekenaitor: that it looks too good?
[3:13:05] gloomygl: He's on that ZAZA
[3:13:05] BigTrout3: I bet he wouldn't say ff14 needs 40 man raids
[3:13:05] Clindo_: ????????
[3:13:05] crucial1711: I like competitive MMO content, like what.
[3:13:05] uncred95: bro the game is 20 years old
[3:13:06] spiritcheese: what is Overdesign?
[3:13:06] Lorrdzik: Peach talk about it one time
[3:13:06] Jarlan23: he thinks theres button and r otational bloat
[3:13:06] Cjpriest: the game is over designed tbf
[3:13:07] spivet: professional gamers are why I dont have a 4090
[3:13:07] BlayzeRM: I think he just means theres more shit going on visually
[3:13:07] andaroo: Look I loved my EverQuest 72 person raids taking on Tunare, but I ain't getting that on a Friday night in 2024
[3:13:07] Badd_Boi: its just word salad, dudes an imbecile
[3:13:08] Sathenus: 40 man RAIDS THO
[3:13:08] Frilner: Boss is only allowed to have 2 spells per encounter
[3:13:08] dundlen: its an online game, 40 people and connections in one spot
[3:13:09] Qwasty: Less buttons
[3:13:09] zubulluu: "over designing" KEKW
[3:13:09] arxi0: classic andy take if ive ever heard one
[3:13:09] Basic_3: He wants bosses to have no mechanics
[3:13:10] Rey40fp: @spiritcheese @mezmerized09 @zenkodac @fronkacean @Therealbrokensword I understand that. But when you see other people using them all the time it makes you think you are not playing the game properly. That's how I feel and I have friends who think that too. Just an opinion.
[3:13:11] Lorrdzik: there was video about it
[3:13:11] noirlol: Deadge
[3:13:11] bigmeanbeefy: Or maybe its because we dont sit around auto attacking half the raid kek
[3:13:11] Azikielboi: more complex mechanics = more cpu load @Maximum
[3:13:11] Jovent2: It means having 10000 mechanics on Tindral at the same time
[3:13:12] grozzarr: less shiny spells
[3:13:12] malnourish_: it means absolutely fuck all
[3:13:12] Bigace1116: I don't have negative frame rates but thats people playing on a 1050ti lol
[3:13:12] Sulm: armchair developer lol
[3:13:12] JWallace: no graphics
[3:13:12] yuhkz: the game engine is like a million years old
[3:13:12] DeathlyRaiser: Just have the same 4 smash animations
[3:13:13] theweirdsquiggly: as someone who watched asmon for 2years and doesn’t anymore, yes all he does is complain
[3:13:13] LoonerFlare: I mean I feel like its more because the game is just bigger. Not that its "over designed"
[3:13:13] kallisz: he has nostalgic memory which makes his takes fucking insane. its like a nostalgic mental issue
[3:13:13] malavander: what potatoes are people playing on where wow is low fps?
[3:13:14] Evan_Ralston: he wants bosses with 2 mechanics like it was in 2010
[3:13:14] Kiqa__: WhoLetHimJoel
[3:13:14] Cakerinotv: how dare he try to say how I am allowed to play the game. If i wanna play the game competitively let me @Maximum
[3:13:15] blinkawayz: i mean tindral is pretty much like that
[3:13:16] Ariesui: bring back fullscreen mode ingame and not just windowed
[3:13:17] NotD4k: its burnt
[3:13:17] Mealkey: :)
[3:13:18] 770Cash: dude wants 40 people auto attacking
[3:13:21] SniggleJake572: its just a catch all phrase that doesnt mean anything that he made up
[3:13:24] SirScizor2020: he wants it to look like classic aka like shit LUL
[3:13:24] Azikielboi: too much math
[3:13:24] Niconatelver: too many mechanics i would guess he means
[3:13:24] goekenaitor: but 40 man raids would make your game run better?
[3:13:25] KaisenSiru: ???????
[3:13:26] BrandonAUS: whaat
[3:13:26] Sathenus: @Maximum he wants 40 man raids BRO, talk about performance loss
[3:13:27] mfalc: its an ancient engine amsongold
[3:13:27] Faraday5001: ?
[3:13:28] yuhkz: ??????
[3:13:28] nate54881: lol GraPHIcs ToO GuD
[3:13:28] Barborsa: "You made too much game for me"
[3:13:29] バナン: 40 Man raid will kill raiding
[3:13:29] Bigace1116: This game is under designed lmoa
[3:13:29] misran: he wants to go back to 2 mechanic molten core bosses
[3:13:30] zubulluu: fight have 1 mechanic = no lag :)
[3:13:31] cravecrate: he means complicated
[3:13:31] LoonerFlare: bruh its definitely not that
[3:13:31] fronkacean: @Rey40fp yeah no i agree that its a massive flaw, but i just dont see a way u can go back without slighting your ENTIRE current audience
[3:13:31] Niral1241: let me have 40 people spamming animations..... thats totally going to lower the fps drops
[3:13:32] fatlittlepaypig: this guy wakes up every day, reacts for 9 hours, and then plays weeb games
[3:13:33] nightst314: COMPLETELY!!!! always 100%
[3:13:35] aMoteofCosmicTruth: AHHAHA
[3:13:35] grimzero617: Keep saying it, it'll make sense at some point
[3:13:35] gloomygl: he just wants 2007 wow lets be real
[3:13:36] kotabraun: What that has to do with FPS
[3:13:37] Austrian: LOL
[3:13:37] ctang0: LUL
[3:13:37] Kiqa__: bro got the whole kitchen burnt
[3:13:37] SlowboLaggins: what does that even mean KEKW
[3:13:39] od3x: Overcooked take
[3:13:39] StarShopping95: YEP
[3:13:40] ruuzee: what does that mean lmfao
[3:13:41] Galarian_Hp: Tindral intermission is also eyecancer without nightpot, u cant see if something is in front or behind, its just a learn ur flying route thing
[3:13:41] gretriku: he just says it so his sheep fans will just clap and agree with him
[3:13:42] Line_0: What does that have to do with framerates
[3:13:43] direbeest: all these ff14 comparisons, asmons played less ff14 than wow
[3:13:44] FloatNg: i started this expansion and im 6/9m
[3:13:45] Tarthris: no examples moves on
[3:13:46] mezmerized09: @Rey40fp and thats okay, but if you are just casually playing you can definitely get by without them, just have fun :)
[3:13:47] klondike_wow: my man is stuck in 2004
[3:13:48] i_Static: 40 man raids would make it run better!! Jfc man
[3:13:49] Ninjian: his brain is so beyond cooked wtf
[3:13:51] Thatorphankid20: This guy has made a whole career bitching about wow. I fucking hate him.
[3:13:51] oonanilord: @Maximum such as 50 different mechanics?
[3:13:51] DunzoCD: does he ever say positive things about wow?
[3:13:51] kajarn: Overdesigned as in there is too much going on
[3:13:53] vaironixx: guy should be a politician with all the nonsense she he spews lol
[3:13:54] Noshpan: That was quite the word salad
[3:13:57] pjcurtin: no one knows what it means but its provocative
[3:13:58] ctang0: YEP
[3:13:59] ret_palitao: I go into retail wow 1 year ago, and now I'm juuuuuuuust about to get CE
[3:14:00] nemziac: too many buttons and too many story quests that dont make sense together
[3:14:00] Avulsionn: they have a new quest log next xpac right?
[3:14:01] mumboze: I kinda get what he's saying, Tindral is so laggy for some of our guild members, we've had to help people tune their graphics
[3:14:02] 324bee21: dang I wanted to watch this later on VOD it’s gonna be last my bedtime
[3:14:02] Avarizz: its not just an issue with wow, its an issue with many games.
[3:14:04] spiritcheese: @Rey40fp bad opinion if you feel bad if you watch other player play the game . thats a you problem and not the game
[3:14:04] Themselves: oonanilord name one boss that has close to 50 different mechanics bojo
[3:14:05] maplelost: just pay for a boost and pay for gear whats so complicated
[3:14:05] ctang0: MY SISTER HAD THAT HAPPEN TO HER
[3:14:06] cornflakezza: we have 2004 wow get released
[3:14:07] kallisz: he also says he can easily clear mythic, which he could, but it isnt THAT crazy to get into wow
[3:14:08] Basic_3: When you hit max level you get the toast for the current patch content, don't you?
[3:14:11] goekenaitor: that's what happened to me when i hit max for the first time in SL
[3:14:13] DesH58: TRUE
[3:14:14] bringback6v6_ow: New player here tanking 20s. Game is not bad I don’t even use many addons 😂
[3:14:14] Balamb: facts.
[3:14:15] Azikielboi: YEP
[3:14:18] Cjpriest: so overdesigned?
[3:14:21] zenkodac: Rey40fp take it from a bunch of people who play this game pretty seriously you arn't playing it wrong, just dive in have fun and learn as you go when you're ready for that step it wont be as scary
[3:14:21] Azikielboi: its true
[3:14:21] Gazmango09: he just wants classic wow but he doesnt even play classic wow. litearlly just pandering for attention
[3:14:23] Rey40fp: @fronkacean I agree. It's hard to get rid of all of it all. I dont know how can this be resolved honestly.
[3:14:23] LoonerFlare: He cant clear mythic
[3:14:25] lieutenantdan416: If i was new and questiong and could right click all the way to max level id quit instantly
[3:14:26] LoonerFlare: He needs to be carried
[3:14:26] MajorFrog225: we don't need more talents everytime we level up lol
[3:14:30] heyitsdeli: very true when i hit max level in BFA i didnt even have a necklace or cloak for a good 3 weeks bc i didnt even know they existed
[3:14:30] azm07: i can put my dog to play with ball on keyboard and she will end up with pink parses as ret pala i think this game is very newby friendly
[3:14:31] RequisiteOfED: MMO's are pretty niche now and the leveling is just filler content now
[3:14:31] Azikielboi: yeah thats what he meant by "overdesigned" @Maximum
[3:14:31] direbeest: the only otk member that can talk about wow is soda and the rest are just clickbaiting
[3:14:32] Tooyoo: WoW is too difficult now
[3:14:35] BigTrout3: YEAR OF THE PRUNE
[3:14:36] Avulsionn: they really should look at button bloat again
[3:14:36] Ravical75: poe pog
[3:14:36] Balamb: same reason I can't play PoE
[3:14:37] fatbotmgrrl: Too much button bloat now
[3:14:37] mezmerized09: It's definitely a learning curve
[3:14:37] jtp787: hero talents will only make that worse
[3:14:38] deadie3D: thats exactly what he is talking aboyut
[3:14:39] spivet: just play BM hunter lol
[3:14:40] Avarizz: its the same for league
[3:14:41] 0rektquiem: It is. I started 2 weeks ago and it was DAMN overwhelming
[3:14:42] garynrex2: LOGIN
[3:14:43] Therapy2: @Maximum sasha grey reached 70 and unistalled
[3:14:43] Jovent2: It means having 10000 mechanics on Tindral at the same time to make it difficult
[3:14:44] Slapsstick: i played for a month in bfa S1, actually started playing in bfa S4, it wasnt that bad
[3:14:45] daoCZ: LOGIN
[3:14:48] iamthegodcomplex: Make the mechanics of encounters more difficult and make rotations easier
[3:14:54] trentbail23: The community is pretty harsh to new players. i know i started in 10.1.5
[3:14:55] aithran: Chatting
[3:14:55] Monsuno: @Maximum I just started playing 6 months ago. It took me 3 months to finally keybind my final ability
[3:14:55] Themselves: @Jovent2 can u name 4 tindral mechanics
[3:14:57] LoonerFlare: @MajorFrog225 Blizzard tried that. People didnt like it.
[3:14:58] Robohobbo: you prune buttons
[3:15:00] kajarn: Good luck trying to explain how each talent swap changes your rotation for a single DPS spec of a single class
[3:15:01] maplelost: WoW 2
[3:15:02] malnourish_: I have said for YEARS that they need more in game announcements and info about the game baked in, so that people don’t HAVE to go to so many 3rd party sites to figure it out
[3:15:03] IamBadSry: wow needs a onramp for people. It just pushes you in the deep end. You don't even get a good luck Sadge
[3:15:05] Robohobbo: Arcane
[3:15:06] Razdruid: monk
[3:15:06] Cjpriest: hes gone on about the overdesigned issue before and this is ALL apart of it lol
[3:15:10] Fannypackk: i got my friend into it at the start of this expansion and he took no time learning but he also played runescape his whole life lol
[3:15:10] 0rektquiem: But yeah, I did buy into it and I'm learning one step at a time. As it should be.
[3:15:10] Avulsionn: i mean ret and dh have way less buttons than other classes
[3:15:10] grimzero617: Please don't take my buttons
[3:15:10] StarShopping95: Unholy
[3:15:11] waelrick: brewmaster
[3:15:11] BlayzeRM: dh would end up with a single button
[3:15:11] WARM_s6: ww mayyybe
[3:15:12] Avulsionn: and are fun
[3:15:12] Azikielboi: i swear the math from talents add cpu load, but maybe not idk im a rat
[3:15:12] ashelfal: Dev evoker wouldnt have any buttons at that point
[3:15:13] Ruinx81: BM is already 2 button
[3:15:13] mavrikbtw: Enh Shaman would be more fun
[3:15:13] seriousalsa: All of their explanation on how to play the game is in the quests that people dont read.
[3:15:13] Rey40fp: @spiritcheese I know other people feel that way so I'm not alone on this but yes, it's a me problem. It just my opinion honestly.
[3:15:14] Razdruid: Monk with 5 less buttons would be better
[3:15:14] Xanctius: Negative 2 buttons for a few spec
[3:15:15] Ravical75: brewmaster monk
[3:15:15] ta_kov: please dont go back legion design
[3:15:16] TheNore: Brewmaster?
[3:15:16] yowler_: the only reason the classes are so complex is bc they dont know what else to do a for a new expansion
[3:15:17] ThisIsAsabel: Nah pruning has been tested, it's SHIT
[3:15:17] kotabraun: Can easily remove 5 from enh/ww
[3:15:18] Basic_3: Mage could lose 5 buttons.
[3:15:19] nanerpus_: He literally just wants classic
[3:15:19] oonanilord: @Themselves yeah sorry but I think that's "over-designed"
[3:15:19] Wunshi: its not the buttons its all the little things you have to up keep the buffs and procs and stuff
[3:15:20] SploogeShot: bm hunter
[3:15:24] malavander: what buttons though?  Unending Breath?
[3:15:24] Gorakk82: some do need like 1 or 2 removed honestly
[3:15:25] yuhkz: best part of the game
[3:15:26] ComicsWoW: they tried button pruning already
[3:15:27] sycho_shotz_: just play ret paladin or bm hunter
[3:15:27] Robohobbo: bro
[3:15:28] Jovent2: @Themselves Can you show me a photo where you see the ground on tindral when he starts rooting, starfiring, and fire beaming at the same time? Also dispels
[3:15:28] ElderSeas: Dh would have no buttons left if you removed 5
[3:15:29] AnarchyMoose: healers need to be mega pruned. most of the dps are ok.
[3:15:30] Lachithor: monk tank for sure needs buttons removed:D
[3:15:30] mavrikbtw: @kotabraun Preach!
[3:15:31] azm07: new players have ret paladin or bm hunter
[3:15:32] vtech310: should create a toddler spec for each class
[3:15:32] gankeds: brewmaster is fun because of the button bloat
[3:15:32] TheNore: WW with stupid statue on main tree?
[3:15:32] Robohobbo: arcane could lose fucking 10 buttons
[3:15:33] Deece_: the gameplay is the sauce
[3:15:33] SideOf6: shadow
[3:15:33] ItchY_val: yeah its a fine line for sure
[3:15:34] gloomygl: @SploogeShot GoodTake
[3:15:35] Wunshi: like you dot something with boomkin and you get like 4 debuffs on a target
[3:15:35] Noirec: @Robohobbo What buttons can arcane lose
[3:15:35] LoonerFlare: @nanerpus_ he doesnt even want classic, because he doesnt play it anymore
[3:15:39] Diazanite: @Razdruid which monk (there is a wrong answer) ((do not say windwalker maximumGlock ))
[3:15:39] hapjaa: AINTNOWAY
[3:15:42] Qwasty: Rogue would be better
[3:15:42] zerojay: arcane rotation KEKBye
[3:15:46] Weslicus: Now give them arcane
[3:15:47] Laxxean: imagine removing 5buttons from Dev evoker. you literally wont have any buttons left lmao
[3:15:47] MajorFrog225: asmon needs to respec to a hunter lol
[3:15:48] kajarn: You have the entire classic WotLK and SoD player base you could get cross over from at minimum
[3:15:48] madhatterui: evoker was pretty easy to learn
[3:15:50] the_great_simonator: but then there's unholy lol
[3:15:50] Avulsionn: enh has so many buttons man
[3:15:51] noirlol: wow gameplay > all
[3:15:52] Kevmoeman: passives and procs cause lag, it was the worst in BFA when you had 40 buffs active on every character
[3:15:52] SlowboLaggins: 5 less buttons on fury wouldnt even have buttons KEKW
[3:15:53] yeyanow: Eye beam and win
[3:15:55] Razdruid: brew 100%
[3:15:56] Galarian_Hp: just press what does the most dmg
[3:15:57] LoonerFlare: arcane rotation needs to be nuked into fucking orbit
[3:15:58] Slapsstick: @Diazanite brewmaster monk keybinds monka
[3:15:59] sabaron: people just typing random specs and classes KEKW
[3:16:01] JWallace: he wants classic but he doesn’t even play classic
[3:16:02] Ravical75: @LoonerFlare he wants classic but it cant be actually classic, like disguised classic
[3:16:03] Diazanite: o ok thats fair
[3:16:05] kajarn: yap
[3:16:05] bladenkurama: DK is easier
[3:16:07] rtcinema: DHs are an example of a class that has several abilities combined... Imagine if pallys lost divine steed and instead bubbling gave them a sprint. It's not a fun button because they have different purposes
[3:16:07] Rey40fp: @zenkodac I try every time, honestly. But there is always people you find along the way that want to put addons on your face and make you feel you are playing the game wrong.
[3:16:07] Diazanite: i havent played brm
[3:16:09] grimzero617: They designed it. But then they designed it more?
[3:16:14] SkrrtRussel: PopNemo
[3:16:19] Robohobbo: nether tempest, combine RS into TotM, remove mirror images, remove mass poly (which you need for Rise on high Tyr for Morchie), remove Ice Nova
[3:16:20] Wildfire_Gaming: Streaming
[3:16:20] RequisiteOfED: That's just how I live my life
[3:16:24] trentbail23: take away buttons from brewmaster, enchance, arcane and remove unholy festering wounds. bam
[3:16:25] mezmerized09: actual worst case scenario KEKW
[3:16:25] bladenkurama: Druid ain’t that hard
[3:16:26] ssj_lenin: thats how you make the big bucks
[3:16:26] ta_kov: the lagg is due to poor graphic design has nothing to do anything else
[3:16:26] LoonerFlare: @Ravical75 I feel like he would just play SoD then, but he hasnt tried
[3:16:26] huntercreeper54: he overdesigned his phrase
[3:16:27] Gorakk82: Asmon needs to tryhard a season to see if he like it all his opinion is hearsay
[3:16:28] Slapsstick: @Diazanite its the most buttons of any class i think, especially if you play dampen and diffuse
[3:16:28] Zarroe: so michael scotting
[3:16:30] Razdruid: MW isn't that much better tho tbh like has a bunch of healing buttons but you only use like half of them
[3:16:36] Qwasty: That's why Ret is the most popular class, people like easy classes.
[3:16:37] bladenkurama: oh wow the dots dot
[3:16:42] Robohobbo: @Noirec nether tempest, combine RS into TotM, remove mirror images, remove mass poly (which you need for Rise on high Tyr for Morchie), remove Ice Nova..
[3:16:42] Gorakk82: im sure he could do it if he put his mind to it
[3:16:43] Cjpriest: it should just be QOL changes IN GAME
[3:16:47] nayrcraig: Meon Tindral :)
[3:16:49] JERAULT: the narcissus addon increased my load times by like 20 seconds each
[3:16:50] TomaHawK_The_One: YEs with no add on i get 50% more fps
[3:16:53] SkrrtRussel: moon2DOIT unlimited frames
[3:16:53] WolfgangAmpersand: They need the Qwazi video
[3:16:53] spiritcheese: @Rey40fp so if its a you problem why you cry in chat .. just fix it
[3:16:54] rymal__: ElvUI was always an issue for me
[3:16:54] Bigace1116: all classes are easy tho lol
[3:16:55] grozzarr: dentist chair
[3:16:58] Timothy_Longshorts: the shear amount of questlines is ridiculous. the direction for a new character is so confusing
[3:16:58] bayazijr: Have to disable details on last two bosses

[3:17:02] mezmerized09: THIS SHOULD BE GOOD
[3:17:02] Piman34: i mean i play wow on a steamdeck...
[3:17:02] NotD4k: KEKW

[3:17:03] MajorFrog225: get the dune bucket
[3:17:03] luixun: dude i have 717k weakauras its my problem if my pc dies because im to lazy to delete old ones

[3:17:08] Morayeden: ??????
[3:17:08] Arwgi: i play raid with 12 addons anything more than that is pointless
[3:17:08] ookazzi: KEKW
[3:17:09] Arcinatos: take so hot fyrakk is jelly
[3:17:09] gigaerick: it's not even 50 addons, it's a select few that use a lot of memory, like weakauras for example
[3:17:12] mezmerized09: ?????
[3:17:14] bladenkurama: more like make it public knowledge
[3:17:14] Therealbrokensword: other than weakauras is there really any addons you truly need?
[3:17:15] maplelost: HE COOKING TOO HARD
[3:17:16] RurryDiff: i still do xD
[3:17:18] huntercreeper54: meterwhore KEKW
[3:17:19] JERAULT: you know, that thing that everybody does in every mmo. get rid of it
[3:17:20] Ravical75: @LoonerFlare ok but i mean like say a brand new mmo comes out and its literally sod but not warcraft he'll probably love it, like he wants classic wow copy and pasted but not from classic wow if that makes sense
[3:17:23] MrIWG: MrIWG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:17:24] Rey40fp: @spiritcheese I'm just asking in chat to see if anyone can give any suggestion which some people did...
[3:17:25] CloudyHS: OMEGALUL
[3:17:26] mezmerized09: He loved it til he was washed KEKW
[3:17:26] Destrolisher: the wipe KEKW
[3:17:27] Spartany25: Asmon loved doing it until he got bad at it LUL
[3:17:27] Slapsstick: @Therealbrokensword details is required
[3:17:28] codydoubleu: KEKW he loved it until he was below the tank in his viewer raids
[3:17:28] CloudyHS: MEH PULL
[3:17:29] StarShopping95: EZ
[3:17:29] JoaEUW: @Maximum its 3 am i really need to go to bed, any chance this will be a youtube vid
[3:17:30] Sithandra_Li: The idea that you wouldn't need so many boss mechanics if people weren't able to trivialize so many of them with addons.
[3:17:31] Phatori: not the meh pull arc
[3:17:32] NotD4k: GIGACHAD
[3:17:34] ookazzi: lmao
[3:17:36] Todo88: 3 of those in every raid KEKW
[3:17:36] Old_Tomatoes: lol
[3:17:40] Azikielboi: @Therealbrokensword enemy target nameplates id argue are pretty neded
[3:17:40] SkrrtRussel: GIGACHAD
[3:17:42] mezmerized09: Oh god he's not
[3:17:44] malnourish_: lmaoooo I forgot about that
[3:17:46] Wildfire_Gaming: PauseChamp
[3:17:46] zenkodac: Rey40fp if they are that insistent and cant be reasoned with it just means their opinions should be disregarded, so dont worry about those people dont give them control of your enjoyment, you do you and enjoy
[3:17:47] LoonerFlare: @Ravical75 Yes that makes total sense. He wants a game to give him the same feeling vanilla did
[3:17:49] StarShopping95: Emerald Nightmare parses KEKW
[3:17:50] mezmerized09: Pulling up old logs oh god dont do it Asmon
[3:17:51] talkley: he’s not
[3:17:51] rottisxd: 95% percentile login
[3:17:52] zenkodac: boomer moment
[3:17:53] fatlittlepaypig: he parsed when every class had 3 buttons
[3:17:54] minatozakixQ: LUL
[3:17:54] Noirec: @Robohobbo Nether tempest I can agree with, the only button that doesnt interact with the kit. Mirror hard disagree, other buttons are optional talents that you can just like, not run?
[3:17:58] greenmachine11235: When my mythic guild needs to bring in a pug to fill if they say ANYTHING about pugs they get kicked. High parse = low mechanic doing
[3:17:59] Celestial990: @Spartany25 no, he didnt want to wipe 5 hrs per night on mistress in ToS
[3:17:59] N1xern: Asmon flexing his legion logs again
[3:17:59] Destrolisher: classic logs OMEGALUL
[3:18:00] ThisIsAsabel: Soooo hypocritical
[3:18:00] Mautdota: Oh this is a guild?
[3:18:01] huntercreeper54: look at my blue parses EZ
[3:18:03] noirlol: DIESOFCRINGE
[3:18:04] SlowboLaggins: big true
[3:18:05] oonanilord: i will kick everyone whos not doing 100k+ dmg noobs
[3:18:05] Cjpriest: parsing is a toxic way of gatekeeping
[3:18:06] mezmerized09: YEP
[3:18:07] ookazzi: yep
[3:18:07] Balamb: true.
[3:18:09] PrimeTimeRime: thsoe people suck  but details is goated
[3:18:09] aMoteofCosmicTruth: look at how good my logs were (ignore the padding) the good ol days are better
[3:18:09] Powzoar: A Parsonlity if you will
[3:18:10] Protoman_702: my entire guild grey parces and we still clear heroic
[3:18:10] Starcillo: HUH
[3:18:10] Line_0: If you aren't being a freak about it parsing is fun though
[3:18:10] Gorakk82: 100%
[3:18:10] PrimeTimeRime: kill them
[3:18:11] Clox9: but my ego tho
[3:18:13] Fannypackk: back in my daay
[3:18:14] PolishBunny: @maplelost 99, classic wrath here + 98/ retail. he isn't cooking. Parsing ruins the integrity of game.
[3:18:15] avenira_qt: bro is dusting off the box from the closet rn
[3:18:15] Monsuno: Parsing as a measurement of progress is fine
[3:18:20] RoloDB: @PrimeTimeRime wild
[3:18:22] talkley: this is only a thing in classic KEKW
[3:18:22] spivet: those people would find a different thing to be demons about
[3:18:22] NotD4k: parsing helps self improvement a lot
[3:18:22] Austrian: i really enjoy improving every week and see my parses go up
[3:18:24] Todo88: People ignoring mechanics during prog for parse are the worst
[3:18:24] yeyanow: They will be insufferable regardless
[3:18:24] Lyonidus: he parsed when he was the raid leader and would avoid doing mechanics for more dps
[3:18:28] zenkodac: you cant make that not a thing, thats on people not the game
[3:18:28] JERAULT: looking at somebody elses parses is a good way to minmax your own performance.
[3:18:28] Hannes_tf: I have one of those friends it's horrible
[3:18:29] Gorakk82: logs are too valuable to remove
[3:18:30] gloop1: Seeing big dps on a meter feels so good tho
[3:18:31] PirateBob_: personal logs
[3:18:31] DecayingPopcorn: E
[3:18:31] Welsy_: these players will not suddenly start doing mechanics and helping the group if they cant see their numbers
[3:18:31] Ardenth: fuck reviewing and improving your gameplay
[3:18:31] ThebluesBilly: from coming from wrath to retail, parsing on classic is way worst than retail
[3:18:33] coolhotjackedguy: @Maximum i think making logs not public would help
[3:18:33] goulashnihao: give everyone participation trophies
[3:18:33] Therapy2: cease and desist warcraftogs
[3:18:35] zubulluu: parsing is a lot of peoples reason to play on farm
[3:18:35] mezmerized09: Logs are helpful for just fixing mistakes
[3:18:36] Old_Tomatoes: Too many idiots misuse logs
[3:18:36] Gorakk82: people just take it too far
[3:18:36] CloudyHS: HAH
[3:18:37] mezmerized09: Not just flexing
[3:18:38] nayrcraig: You can have logs with out parses, parses are generated by WCL
[3:18:38] cornflakezza: why asmon use this page
[3:18:39] grimzero617: How will I know if I'm improving?
[3:18:40] seriousalsa: what if you just remove a ranking system
[3:18:42] nemziac: I dont care about parses but just want to know where I missed a proc
[3:18:42] DecayingPopcorn: Aug is the solution
[3:18:43] quorra112: for self improvement
[3:18:44] Docaan: If there is no dmg meter then there is no longer joy in pumping
[3:18:44] CloudyHS: HAH PROFESSIONAL
[3:18:45] ItchY_val: So good for improvment
[3:18:45] heffdogga: gonna be the moon boss dude in night hold for his parae
[3:18:46] Jimmyturbo: number go up YEP
[3:18:46] PrimeTimeRime: @RoloDB in game. lol
[3:18:46] Rey40fp: @zenkodac will try to improve my mentality going into it esfandL
[3:18:47] Roundhere_: asmon has boomer takes on WoW now
[3:18:47] turtleulty: i use it to see myself improve
[3:18:49] fronkacean: AMEN
[3:18:49] LoonerFlare: Personally. I like seeing how good Im doing relative to other people
[3:18:50] kookluhh: I love seeing my 27 parses
[3:18:50] BrandonAUS: its already hard to tell a good player from a bad WITH RIO, without any score impossible
[3:18:51] Mautdota: I just wanna get better man
[3:18:51] neugassh: just count in your head
[3:18:51] Airitreya: I love seeing myself go from 70-90s in heroic/normal
[3:18:52] fronkacean: FUCK AUGMENTATION
[3:18:53] Themselves: he's gonna pull up the log where his guild simped him so he could get a single good parse in the 15 years he's played this game lmao
[3:18:53] RandaIFire: also like logs are so insane for improvement
[3:18:53] vanchacha: posture check gamer
[3:18:54] lastericalive: it would be very annoying to not know how good you are doing
[3:18:55] MajorFrog225: remove dps
[3:18:55] LoonerFlare: Its the same reason I like scoreboards in like..clone hero
[3:18:55] DrBazingaSC: Learning...
[3:18:56] Cjpriest: design an in game damage meter than you can extract your details
[3:18:56] RurryDiff: i just like seeing myself improve from week to week
[3:18:59] bladenkurama: how am I supposed to be delusional if I know what’s going on
[3:18:59] kallisz: also a great learning tool
[3:19:00] Taytor: THE SOLUTION IS DELET AUG
[3:19:00] x_Baggers: if i couldnt track my personal performance, id never dps
[3:19:02] LoonerFlare: I want to see how good I do in relation to someone else
[3:19:03] dundlen: @maximum I feel like the problem with parsing is with how people approach and use it. if you use it as a way to look at your performance and how to improve, i don't think its a bad thing
[3:19:04] The_Boctor: i like seeing the dumb shit like the shadow priest who had 46 external buffs on a sylvanas kill
[3:19:04] Chamiunt: HAH
[3:19:04] huntercreeper54: tonight i did 15k more dps on my fyrakk kill and i'm happy about myself YEP
[3:19:05] CloudyHS: @Maximum POSTURE CHECK
[3:19:05] Themselves: he's gonna pull up the log where his guild simped him so he could get a single good parse in the 15 years he's played this game and use it to say that parsing should be removed HAH
[3:19:06] Timothy_Longshorts: how do you get better without being able to see how you are currently
[3:19:07] Slapsstick: people just need to play the game more. seems like people complain more than game
[3:19:08] kotabraun: And without logs the balance would be absolutely terrible
[3:19:09] tarth_100: I like details more for the ability to see damage breakdowns and see which abilities I wasn't pressing enough
[3:19:09] Therealbrokensword: ff14 not having damage metres is the reason I stopped playing, how do I know if Im doing well?
[3:19:09] gloomygl: 30 LMAOOOO
[3:19:09] lukurjd: LMAO
[3:19:10] Azikielboi: i mean asmon has the easy solution, ban it xdd
[3:19:10] mezmerized09: oh god LOL
[3:19:10] みょせつ: sit up you croissant
[3:19:12] Crystallize007: 💀
[3:19:12] PirateBob_: blizzard makes personal logs ingame
[3:19:13] Cap1600: i use an abacus
[3:19:16] StarShopping95: KEKW
[3:19:18] fatbotmgrrl: I use the meters for getting better.  I still use the target dummies to get used to a new class
[3:19:23] SkrrtRussel: @みょせつ KEKW
[3:19:23] NBI_s: checking high parses for the classes I play is how I get better
[3:19:24] 2Bs_tasty_feet: He lucked out and got the 2 BIS legos
[3:19:25] panacer: "guys I was good 10 years ago"
[3:19:25] ThisIsAsabel: If you turn off your monitor, you can't be toxic about dps Kappa FACTS

[3:19:32] fronkacean: 59.2 AVG
[3:19:32] Niconatelver: oh yeah purple logs dogJAM
[3:19:33] yeyanow: Also gives a way to focus on self-improving versus focus on guildies messing stuff up
[3:19:34] fronkacean: KEKW
[3:19:34] nanerpus_: MAx go back to his current boss parses
[3:19:35] misran: ignore those green and grey parses that were there before he went back 8 years

[3:19:54] zenkodac: Rey40fp i'm sure you'll have tons of fun wow has a ton to explore when you just let yourself go for the ride, specially with a couple of like minded friends
[3:19:58] burlin_: @Maximum posture check
[3:20:00] Tachygraphy: posture check chief @Maximum
[3:20:01] rottisxd: elisande median looks like he died a lot
[3:20:02] asd123qwerty1: @fronkacean you have to zoom in in the posture check in the yt video this man is almost falling backwards KEKW
[3:20:03] So_0bvious: sepulcher
[3:20:03] lukurjd: 7 kills med 19 is giga sus
[3:20:05] Spartany25: @misran exactly. he got bad at raiding then says get rid of logs lmao
[3:20:07] LoonerFlare: @Ruinx81 his takes have always been "hurr durrr make it easier easier is better"
[3:20:07] MajorFrog225: lol what he do on Elisande
[3:20:16] x_Baggers: 'raided a lot back then' -> 7 kills
[3:20:18] yeahp0n: my guild needed augur to get nerfed
[3:20:19] Galarian_Hp: Max is using his mindpalace
[3:20:19] gloomygl: bruh heroic spine was a bitch
[3:20:20] JERAULT: 7 kills on elisande and best is 37%
[3:20:21] nayrcraig: Love watchin this chats reaction to seeing parses lmao
[3:20:22] LoonerFlare: @asd123qwerty1 fucking zooted
[3:20:22] MajorFrog225: how do you get a 100 parse and a 37
[3:20:23] Turkeypitz: objectively though, I remember playing ffxiv and feeling weird not to have addons - but it was kind of liberating too - just saying there can be a world where we can enjoy stuff
[3:20:26] cornflakezza: when addons and Pages remove from wow asmon cant Show us the Insane dps
[3:20:27] Cjpriest: @nanerpus_ whats the pooint? lol he doesnt play the game currently so thats a dumb thing to point out lol
[3:20:30] aMoteofCosmicTruth: don't look anywhere beyond surface level of these logs because it surely doesnt matter if its all padding or towards the end of the season
[3:20:36] 1_blase: KEKW
[3:20:36] mezmerized09: ???
[3:20:36] kajarn: The patch after Nighthold was ToS which had Avatar and KJ lmfao

[3:20:49] Arcinatos: LULW TRUUE
[3:20:51] vancrusher: talking about parsing and flexing with logs and the avg is like 60 KEKW
[3:20:52] ThoseCrazyGuys: TRUE
[3:20:52] Robohobbo: @Noirec mirrors is one of the examples of the 8 defensives in our kit that people hate. Radiant spark and Totm are both mandatory, Ice Nova is meta for DPS optimization and Mass Poly + RoF is mandatory in Rise on high ttyrannical w/o druid for the adds (will kiill you on 27-28+ d/t dot)
[3:20:54] huntercreeper54: TRUUE
[3:20:54] bayazijr: Parsing is a fun little minigame I don't see the problem.
[3:20:54] GearzxGaming: logs are something a lot of ppl find fun
[3:20:54] pvalue01: True
[3:20:55] Ruinx81: Classic community in shambles with no Parsing
[3:20:55] PrimeTimeRime: yeh maybe if i killed a boss 32 times id get a 99
[3:20:56] fatbotmgrrl: Umm, we had logs back in wrath lol
[3:20:59] darkovian: its the chat on top of the chat for me
[3:21:01] Resci: I only play raid to parse
[3:21:02] huntercreeper54: BASED
[3:21:09] aMoteofCosmicTruth: the pinnacle of trues is the yep emote
[3:21:11] od3x: He really should give some reasons to back that up
[3:21:11] zenkodac: thats impossiable
[3:21:14] Luthaer: isn't this kind of his thing at this point in an expansion?  Things slowing down...you can see the next exp in the future...here comes Asmon hot take
[3:21:14] zannuss: yeah chats are overlapped
[3:21:16] LightsHamer: his takes are never that nuanced
[3:21:19] malnourish_: once again, players have changed
[3:21:20] zerojay: mf can parse with a melee class, im astonished LUL
[3:21:22] PolishBunny: There are some psychos for sure that live for io and parse. Fuck them
[3:21:22] Cjpriest: @Maximum you design an IN GAME details that you can only extract your own stuff wether its healing or dmg
[3:21:23] iamgabe69: @Ruinx81 true, its boring outside of parsing or speedrunning
[3:21:25] misran: @PrimeTimeRime none of his viewers know what that column is so it's fine xdd
[3:21:26] Doomei_TV: So what Asmon is saying is "I've had my time enjoying this, you can remove it from EVERYONE ELSE now"
[3:21:27] iamthegodcomplex: Eh, let people enjoy the game the way they want
[3:21:28] darkovian: Thankyou!
[3:21:29] LoonerFlare: @Luthaer yes
[3:21:29] spiritcheese: xdd
[3:21:30] lieutenantdan416: currently Wow is too boring of a game to not have parses as a way to give it longevity imo
[3:21:31] StarShopping95: only took an hour KEKW
[3:21:32] Azikielboi: xdd
[3:21:32] Welsy_: He would tell you "you dont need to improve, no to competitive"
[3:21:33] zannuss: yay
[3:21:34] Razdruid: you cannot get into most guilds above 100 rank without "good" logs that includes what your parse color is
[3:21:35] nemziac: i think people who dont play the game complain about parsing more than people who actually play
[3:21:36] conebreadIH: I think the sentiment he is trying to convey is that wow is being balanced for the wrong audience for it to be healthy for everyone.
[3:21:37] harps71: just get rid of any way to check how bad people in your group are
[3:21:39] Turkeypitz: @Maximum what about in game threshhold that provided a 'rating'?
[3:21:39] dundlen: you'd have know way to know if you did good
[3:21:40] vynistrian: vids almost done and moves the chat HAHA
[3:21:44] PleaseLessen: That's a social problem not a game problem blizz needs to fix
[3:21:45] bayazijr: Max who are these people even I've never met one of these "parsing is entire personality" people
[3:21:45] yeyanow: They will be around just being insufferable about some other minor thing
[3:21:49] Mitune: an in game personal leader board that cant be shared? throwing ideas
[3:21:50] Razdruid: above 100 I mean like 101 and above
[3:21:50] zenkodac: you were once in that community before you became who you are now Maximum
[3:21:55] Arcinatos: if im not cranking my fun isnt had EZ
[3:21:55] Weebeez: It is also everything for applying to guilds.
[3:21:57] Silencbank: thats not a WoW thing, thats a gamer thing.
[3:21:58] TheZoningBro: As someone who hit top 20 world as an Ele Shaman during SoD, I used logs and parsing to test myself constantly to improve. But I never lorded it over anyone else in my guilds.
[3:22:06] zannuss: I dont care about dps meters cause I suck so they are bad anyway
[3:22:07] the__Benji: You overestimate the amount of people that use WCL to improve and not just to parse
[3:22:08] grozzarr: it all started with gearscore
[3:22:08] みょせつ: i just check damage done to specific enemies in details tbh
[3:22:08] Roundhere_: anytime asmon plays WoW he either gets carried by viewers in keys or in raids or in pvp by r1s.. he doesnt even really play how majority of ppl do
[3:22:09] zenkodac: almost all of your friends in wow were once parse lords
[3:22:11] Teshinator95: literally ever looks at dps xD
[3:22:13] SpleenlessTV: damage meters literally dont even matter at all anymore with pi and aug
[3:22:14] Teshinator95: everyone&*
[3:22:14] jables90: whats the point of farm if no parsing and no gear upgrades
[3:22:15] darkgigaz: Is there a way to block that and blizzard add their own that only the player can see?
[3:22:16] cravecrate: send all the parse looneys to SOD
[3:22:18] PolishBunny: @Razdruid and thats ok, because its a hardcore type of sweaty guild, they should play with like-minded people
[3:22:18] lowincomehooker: Is his Displate still on the floor?
[3:22:19] LoonerFlare: @bayazijr I had three of them in the guild I was in during the beginning of DF and end of SL
[3:22:19] Merex760: I just don't like it when people use meters to talk shit and dunk on other people. It makes the game so shit
[3:22:21] kallisz: timing keys and killing bosses are it for me in wow, relclear sure i try to do more dam and parse higher, but i brag about achievementss not logs
[3:22:21] sabaron: parse culture is in every mmo
[3:22:21] Drazerk: Do people even give a shit in most guilds these days? I feel progress / RIo carries way more weight
[3:22:22] Sathenus: HUH
[3:22:23] Subis050: I think you would have to remove enrage timers and simply be able to kill a boss by doing its dance.
[3:22:26] aithran: No, it's the children that are wrong
[3:22:27] gretriku: BRUH
[3:22:28] mezmerized09: ROFL
[3:22:28] lawldozer: @Maximum i find it ironic that you say that he will get a bunch of trues for a take but the same thing happens for you. you have outliers in chat but most of the people in your chat like watching you for your takes. same goes for him.....
[3:22:28] azm07: competing is fun whats wrong with competing?

[3:22:41] Clox9: No way
[3:22:41] Ruinx81: I think raids are fun lol
[3:22:41] Greannan: No, youd have more guilds lol
[3:22:42] emkatalks: bruh
[3:22:43] Blut103: xdd
[3:22:43] lastericalive: that’s kind of right

[3:22:45] Thdlock: baseg
[3:22:45] munasauna: "Just make if more fun dude"
[3:22:46] spivet: yep thats true, people will stop having birthdays and anniversaries if raids are fun
[3:22:46] cinnamints: @Luthaer yep. that cycle is why we can't have nice things like cheerful gap months between xpacs.
[3:22:46] Mautdota: ????
[3:22:46] gloomygl: THis one is facts
[3:22:47] ZeroDMGDealt: fair

[3:22:48] Line_0: True
[3:22:48] BrandonAUS: second good take!
[3:22:48] qwaade: idk I love to raid
[3:22:49] Noirec: @Robohobbo do you genuinely feel like that removing those buttons would make the spec more fun/better? Optional talents like mass poly/rof allow for actual skill expression for the player and you can choose them only when you need them
[3:22:50] Tanonn: yeah and life doesnt exist baseg
[3:22:50] Merex760: That owns in FF14
[3:22:51] TheRealCunix: The problem with 40 man is go on classic era and get a spot :P u rarely will
[3:22:52] RoloDB: omg this is great LOL
[3:22:52] LifeofSlayer77: baseg true
[3:22:54] bladenkurama: it feels out dated indeed
[3:22:54] direbeest: without covid wow vanilla classic 40 man would have never happened
[3:22:54] zenkodac: dude this is first grade level reasoning
[3:22:55] Strewgle: baseg no walkbacks
[3:22:55] Robohobbo: Elden Ring vs Dark Souls 1
[3:22:55] hxllxwgrave: ???????????? HUH?
[3:22:56] codydoubleu: KEKW "If u make MY changes, the game will have 3 times the playerbase"
[3:22:56] BigTrout3: MAJORW no run backs
[3:22:57] zannuss: I agree, run back is dumb
[3:22:57] donutboyj: problem is for most players, killing 1-5 bosses in mythic doenst feel like an achievement
[3:22:57] Spartany25: 2k CE guilds but no one wants to raid?
[3:22:58] LOLdotCOM: THATS the reason people dont like raiding, sure lol
[3:23:00] lieutenantdan416: YEP
[3:23:02] spiritcheese: i like Raiding
[3:23:03] dundlen: i dont like agreeing with him but yeah, run backs suck
[3:23:04] Oracle_WoW: the bosses people spend the most time on have in room respawns
[3:23:04] PrimeTimeRime: i mean...  its qol
[3:23:05] Roundhere_: ya that isnt a real factor
[3:23:05] DrBazingaSC: Yeah... who cares >.<
[3:23:06] Crystallize007: he has yapped about this for 5 yearas
[3:23:06] Mautdota: Running back after deaths is the LITTLEST issue
[3:23:06] gretriku: that option exists. its called ff14. its a cool game
[3:23:07] Yoitsnova: it does when you play with terrible players
[3:23:07] gwus: it does add up tbf annoying
[3:23:07] Docaan: KEKW
[3:23:07] Gorakk82: he is fishing
[3:23:07] nemziac: gonna have a warlock anyways
[3:23:08] GrimFandango: Streaming was a mistake, take the entire Twitch site down, it's joever
[3:23:10] Welsy_: last time he raided was fucking sunwell
[3:23:10] bglpuppy2: Bro sounds like a boomer saying "these millennial and Gen z don't wanna work"
[3:23:10] mezmerized09: WHO SAYS THATS GOOD FOR THE GAME
[3:23:10] KyleEverett: I hate raid trash and run backs
[3:23:11] Strewgle: YEP
[3:23:11] bladenkurama: that’s a small piece for sure
[3:23:11] Austrian: LOL
[3:23:12] ocicatthedruid: it all adds up though, it's not just one thing
[3:23:12] Gloriance: These takes dewLUL
[3:23:12] Thdlock: some ppl do funnily enough
[3:23:12] Starforkx: i dont raid cuz i dont like walking back to a boss after wipe
[3:23:12] mezmerized09: ROFL
[3:23:14] Thdlock: KEKW
[3:23:14] matteian: its not tho its every night
[3:23:14] StarShopping95: YEP zero to do with raid popularity
[3:23:15] ta_kov: Respawning at boss will make it easy KEKBye
[3:23:15] MajorFrog225: gee i love rebuffing
[3:23:16] conebreadIH: @spiritcheese Naw, I mean that everyone has to be top tier and balanced to do any content.
[3:23:16] 2Bs_tasty_feet: I like running back to the boss :)
[3:23:17] zenkodac: literally no one makes that argument
[3:23:19] DubakuMatumbo: @Maximum They do LUL
[3:23:20] drewsky96: rather straw man
[3:23:20] br3z: cept for  the idiots that afk every wipe
[3:23:20] SlowboLaggins: especially with amirdrassil checkpoints
[3:23:20] LOLdotCOM: Mans out there shadowboxing
[3:23:23] Robohobbo: @Noirec Skill expression makes a spec not playable. see Venruki's video on arcane rotation
[3:23:23] yeyanow: Is tindral and fyrrak that much better than the rest of the bosses?
[3:23:23] mezmerized09: omfg
[3:23:24] Jimmyturbo: bring it up with ION then?
[3:23:25] aMoteofCosmicTruth: its one of the pinnacle "how to fix wow" in his opinion
[3:23:26] mezmerized09: this man KEKW
[3:23:27] Clush___: @Maximum its not this exact single thing, its the collection of stupid fucking things like this though together that makes raid ass
[3:23:28] neugassh: running back is the best part of raiding
[3:23:28] winterr555: @Maximum I've literally argued with people that think running back is good for the game
[3:23:28] fatbotmgrrl: So, he wants the old guild reward of mass res for everyone
[3:23:30] Gorakk82: he just doesnt want to play top end content but wants the shiny
[3:23:35] noirlol: how can 1 person so Delusional, what a NPC
[3:23:35] Drazerk: Food buffs to persist through death lmfao
[3:23:36] Jovent2: @Maximum Everyone without a warlock in a guild knows it's a fucking nightmare
[3:23:37] Ruinx81: All minor issues he has?
[3:23:38] barelyanonymous: except wow devs i guess?
[3:23:40] rustycans: raiding became harder
[3:23:40] Frilner: Environment artists demand that you see their hard work
[3:23:40] Gorakk82: typical of most casuals
[3:23:41] zenkodac: make up a bogeyman then complain about it non stop
[3:23:41] Welsy_: Man shouts at cloud
[3:23:42] mezmerized09: He woke up feelin' zesty
[3:23:42] rtcinema: Classic raid designers would argue the run back makes you think about what you did wrong and encourages you to do better next time
[3:23:43] cravecrate: the run back itself gives people time to contemplate whether they want to stay in the raid over leave vs jumping back into a fight immediately and pushing through
[3:23:43] DeathlyRaiser: That doesn't fit his narrative that's why
[3:23:45] Cjpriest: its not the point that raiding has changed its the fact the game changed for the worse since then
[3:23:48] ZeroDMGDealt: NH banger
[3:23:50] mfalc: you can get food to stay on after death tho
[3:23:52] DeeterDo: CLASSES have changed though
[3:23:53] Piman34: blizzard seems to want the boss run back somehow so there's someone who cares lol
[3:23:54] Kevmoeman: you gota pay a token to get the food buff
[3:23:54] mezmerized09: Legion was actually goated
[3:23:56] Drazerk: Man clearly hasnt played if he thinks food buffs expire on death lol
[3:23:56] dertrapov: what are the other top 2
[3:23:57] 2Bs_tasty_feet: Nighthold killed his guild xdd
[3:23:59] SlowboLaggins: @Drazerk they already do if you run flavor packet
[3:23:59] kallisz: @yeyanow better? very few thinks they are better? theyre harder
[3:24:00] maplelost: hes changed not the game
[3:24:02] Llarrow: prolly why he quit
[3:24:02] dankNstein_: I've actually seen people defend the run back, they claim it's one of the only times in raids where people communicate these days
[3:24:02] Ravical75: i got burnt out and stopped enjoying it and moved on from it and you guys arent allowed to still like it and enjoy it like i once did
[3:24:04] lordsellia: Static 20 raid team is hard to maintain no matter how fun the raid is - keeping a bench is the toughest thing to do as a regular guild
[3:24:04] brokik1: if you quit in legion and come back it feels pretty similar
[3:24:04] ta_kov: agreed
[3:24:04] Sathenus: @mfalc it costs like 100k+ gold to do that, I think his point is the gold cost of raiding
[3:24:06] Jovent2: @Maximum Everyone without a warlock in a guild knows it's a nightmare
[3:24:06] ocicatthedruid: There is a BIG difference. He tried other games finally that do it better
[3:24:06] KlKlDlKl: Im loving wow atm, but I have become more casual
[3:24:07] Drazerk: @SlowboLaggins yeah exactly my point
[3:24:08] gloomygl: his guid died in nighthold
[3:24:10] noirlol: factd
[3:24:12] Tooyoo: @maplelost amen
[3:24:13] BabyDunn: i miss my legion guild :(
[3:24:13] aithran: star augur killing guilds ok

[3:24:17] Gloriance: dewLUL dewLUL
[3:24:17] NotD4k: oh hell nah KEKW
[3:24:18] fatbotmgrrl: Being able to have all the buffs from hunters was pretty awesome in Legion
[3:24:19] Docaan: Let him cook
[3:24:19] alarkin: Raiding has absolutely changed lol. Been raiding this entire time, all of Legion, and BfA, and SL, and now, and before this. Yes, it has changed, including since legion
[3:24:20] rpgonlyforme: it is called flavor pocket
[3:24:20] spiritcheese: @conebreadIH what do you mean? this is BS
[3:24:20] BrandonAUS: food buff dif KEKW
[3:24:21] DrBazingaSC: Clown
[3:24:21] Austrian: what a wild statement KEKW
[3:24:22] rpgonlyforme: and it is wonderful
[3:24:22] huntercreeper54: food buff ruined wow classic
[3:24:22] LifeofSlayer77: baseg
[3:24:23] BigTrout3: there it is!
[3:24:23] fuzzli420: He on the Zaza or?
[3:24:26] Kaiist: Raid saved
[3:24:26] mezmerized09: KEKW
[3:24:28] bezastian: really noticable how he hasnt played the game. you wipe on fyrakk u are instantly infront of the boss again. food buff lasts with alchemist flavor pocket you have to do nothing besides release and do pulltimer
[3:24:28] Lamatastisch: he didnt even do endgame in FF Despairge
[3:24:31] zenkodac: consumables are a essential pillar of the economy and gold making in wow for people who just dont bot or use the token
[3:24:31] lmaoerss: it takes 10 fucking seconds to get food buff back
[3:24:31] Drazerk: food buff persists through death right now
[3:24:32] pvalue01: he just says shit...
[3:24:32] LoonerFlare: @rtcinema aint nothing to think about with little timmy standing in fire for 15 minutes each pull, translate that to now and the same fucking people die to a one shot like smolderons ball debuff stacking
[3:24:32] noirlol: HAHAHAHH ICANT
[3:24:33] codydoubleu: baseg flavor pocket
[3:24:34] headninja1ncharge: You heard it here first *Hip-hop Horns*
[3:24:34] zannuss: So the flasks persisting is from original wow when you could run flasks or elixirs.
[3:24:36] yeyanow: Ff14 had run back :/
[3:24:37] adobegainz1: FOOD BUFFS PERSIST THROUGH DEATH BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY AROUND 60K FOR IT
[3:24:39] GrimFandango: "wow bad, FFX good, updoots to the left"
[3:24:41] Welsy_: can pull again faster, can reach 2000 pulls faster
[3:24:42] BigTrout3: does he want 40 man ff14 raids?
[3:24:43] Clush___: @Maximum its not this exact single thing, its the collection of stupid fucking things like this though together that makes raid ass 󠀀
[3:24:44] kino_xo: People who don't play the game complaining about the game they dont play is always crazy
[3:24:45] rustycans: Yeah because you arent biased at all
[3:24:47] kallisz: tbh consumables and buffs are not great
[3:24:50] Gorakk82: i quit raiding.  why?  the run back is killin me.  kek
[3:24:50] Mezmorised: I feel like he grew out of modern wow and feels a sense of loss from what he felt when he was younger
[3:24:50] aMoteofCosmicTruth: how else will one whip out the notepad and fix an entire game in 2 minutes without being this way tho
[3:24:53] spiritcheese: HUH
[3:24:53] zenkodac: LUL
[3:24:53] ComicsWoW: HOT TAKES
[3:24:54] Cozo_TV: paid comment :)
[3:24:55] StarShopping95: No one wants 40 man raids in retail

[3:24:55] ComicsWoW: KEKW
[3:24:55] LOLdotCOM: Curious Kappa
[3:24:57] ThebluesBilly: raid = bad because i have to run back on death and rebuff
[3:24:57] zenkodac: shit take
[3:24:57] Drows95: did he even raid in FF?
[3:24:58] BabyDunn: we need catgirls in wow

[3:25:42] Crystallize007: ?
[3:25:43] direbeest: the way the raid difficulty and looting works in ff14 is so wildly different than wows raiding and difficulty scaling that comparing the way it works is insane
[3:25:44] zenkodac: is it?
[3:25:45] cheetoenail: ???????
[3:25:45] Qwasty: It changed, I raided mythic in legion and it was very different

[3:25:54] conebreadIH: @spiritcheese That's the perception though, right? It's nuts how "simple" people want raiding these days, so they only take meta shit because it's balanced that way.
[3:25:55] huntercreeper54: he gained 0.1s yeah
[3:25:56] vigilantknives: nothing wrong here

[3:26:07] LOLdotCOM: Streamception
[3:26:09] iamgabe69: @Thatsafy lmao
[3:26:14] Shredmuffn: Rank 1 PVP really affects asmongold and his chat LUL

[3:26:16] omgwatlol: inb4: "BAN KEYBINDINGS TOO!!"
[3:26:16] Thatsafy: @iamgabe69 get asmon to react to max react and then max can react again
[3:26:20] GearzxGaming: step kidney focus target, then he just presses hook to go back without changing a target?  this is like pisslow stuff
[3:26:23] Yoitsnova: @Lorrdzik yes the point is that it doesn't gain you anything
[3:26:24] fugawe7: 4 streamers on the screen is peak 2024 content
[3:26:27] malavander: how many layers of react-ception are we at?

[3:26:49] PastMyLife357: "I can't do this" so it's OP LOL
[3:26:50] Drizzt7: Raid is full of addons - it's hard to watch. Blizzard should do something in this direction. The game shouldn't require a hundred external "cheats" from you.
[3:26:50] fatlittlepaypig: chat doesnt understand because they never killed a non-script in their lives
[3:26:52] Richton867: Reacting to a reacting to a reacting

[3:27:15] sabaron: cant you hook arena target
[3:27:17] gloomygl: That doesn't affect 99.9% of the population

[3:27:38] vigilantknives: its the speed though
[3:27:40] Slapsstick: at player doesnt work, its at cursor the grapple first, then the step kick after because the grapple has travel time @Maximum
[3:27:40] j_hooligan: mouse over for sure
[3:27:42] Camelbak21: It's a cursor kekw

[3:30:08] sabaron: the only thing broken here is the abilities are off gcd, only reason this works KEKW
[3:30:08] huntercreeper54: and that's what happens when you have 3 different spells out of gcd
[3:30:09] PastMyLife357: pretty sure it's because it's off GCD for abilities
[3:30:09] Jazzarus_: making shadowstep GCD solves it
[3:30:09] booznoon: that macro has been available in the game literally FOREVER
[3:30:09] TheItalianStallion321: i mean hes not using a 3rd party program so who gives a shit
[3:30:11] Falzyker: Blizz should put more spells on global
[3:30:13] Melati: GCD
[3:30:13] PrimeTimeRime: GCD
[3:30:13] nemziac: this is old rogue tech tho
[3:30:14] isFeyz: It's GCD
[3:30:14] JERAULT: gcd
[3:30:15] veiloflonelystars: @GearzxGaming ye but the point is how broken it changes gameplay
[3:30:15] Sulm: GCD
[3:30:15] kotabraun: step or kick on the gcd
[3:30:16] 0rektquiem: GCD
[3:30:16] Lindyn773: it is cool but super simple macro. Can easily nerf it by having a small CD for step and hook
[3:30:16] Liquidor: Add global
[3:30:17] Cjpriest: you put it on GCD
[3:30:17] ThisIsAsabel: It's not really good because  it uses all your movement at the same time, which rogus don't want 90% of the time
[3:30:17] nightst314: GCD
[3:30:17] smoothlol: SET TO 1.5X
[3:30:17] Kasperjhn: @Maximum Thats not a macro issue. Its a Rogue issue with 2 mobility abilities off gcd
[3:30:17] ShowDUH: put shit on gcd
[3:30:18] Old_Tomatoes: Put a half second gcd?
[3:30:18] GooseComics: GCD
[3:30:19] Avarizz: but how is that
[3:30:19] Welsy_: GCD
[3:30:19] zenkodac: how is this new thou? these macros exist since forever
[3:30:20] Raer66: you don't.
[3:30:20] LuciFeariUm: GCD adjustments
[3:30:21] azumai_xyz: gcd
[3:30:21] CloudyHS: dont, its not even a problem
[3:30:22] karkarnarnar: add hook to GCD
[3:30:22] Cakerinotv: its a gcd issue
[3:30:22] spiritcheese: hoock on gcd
[3:30:22] Kiqa__: gcd inside arena
[3:30:22] walmartpjs: shadowstep and hook share gcd
[3:30:22] VehxD: if he's talking up final fantasy, the crafters of ff should have to press the individual buttons rather than a macro to use like 10 buttons to make a pot
[3:30:23] the_great_simonator: I just don't get what's wrong with this, isn't it just a cool macro?
[3:30:23] thograll: @Maximum Make hook on the GCD
[3:30:24] Therealbrokensword: youd have to put step on the GCD which bricks the class
[3:30:26] emkatalks: that would be so ass
[3:30:26] cravecrate: gcd kick kek
[3:30:27] SkrrtRussel: yeah gcd is simple but also awful
[3:30:27] nemziac: its been there literally forever
[3:30:27] kjlor: get rid of focus
[3:30:28] Line_0: Guess they need short gcd
[3:30:28] Relyst: @Maximum put Shadowstep and Hook on a shared GCD
[3:30:28] mezmerized09: This guy surely just made the macro for the video KEKW
[3:30:29] Scriix: im addicted to @cursor macros for ground target shit
[3:30:29] Mealkey: @Falzyker that was bfa and players hated it
[3:30:30] gwus: 0.5sec gcd on grapling
[3:30:31] i_Static: gcd or make it go in order
[3:30:31] Slapsstick: make shadowstep and grapple share a GCD style CD
[3:30:31] m33shochque: change hook behavior
[3:30:32] pvalue01: rogues have so much shit off GCD it's cracked
[3:30:35] Dherjee: Different movement ability GCD
[3:30:35] Welsy_: just change grappling
[3:30:37] c10starburst: REMOVE ALL MACROS KEKW
[3:30:37] baddecisiondanx: @PvtCheese you are 1500, why are you even talking about it?
[3:30:40] LoonerFlare: they legit only need to put one of the two movement abilities on the GCD
[3:30:40] kiriuped: make hook tied to shadowstep like vengeful retreat & fel dash
[3:30:41] squarepusher_: The syntax has existed forever.
[3:30:42] LoonerFlare: And that shit is broken
[3:30:43] burlin_: just delete the game 4Head
[3:30:43] zubulluu: nah just put grapple on a global when you step
[3:30:45] yeyanow: Delete rogue
[3:30:45] Cakerinotv: macros also have a gcd for separate spells when used as a macro
[3:30:48] BabyDunn: is it cause shadowstep is an instant teleport?
[3:30:49] St0rmwhisper: GCD specifically for movement abilities
[3:30:50] Oshy__: Shadowstep/Hook need low GCDs like Felblade
[3:30:51] Azikielboi: a shared .5 sec cd between shadowstep adn hook @Maximum
[3:30:53] ThisIsAsabel: I'm sure asmon is gonna say something like "remove all macros"
[3:30:53] Sulm: shadowstep and grappling should probably just share a small CD, but not necessarily GCD
[3:30:56] Thatsafy: just delete rogue, problem solved Kappa
[3:30:56] LoonerFlare: They shouldnt.
[3:30:57] dundlen: @maximum shadowstep and hook trigger a gcd for eachother?
[3:30:58] Madog93: SOD has Shadowstep on GCD and it feels horrible.
[3:30:58] slugg_tk: "I dont think this is super good" after all that lol
[3:30:59] odificiency: it's okay, vengeful glad chat was doing this since BC.
[3:31:00] Azikielboi: a shared .5 sec cd between shadowstep adn hook @Maximum would solve it
[3:31:01] DamagedWoW: wonder how hard it would be for blizzard to implement an even smaller gcd like a 1/4 or 1/8th of a normal gcd
[3:31:02] BrandonAUS: it has 0 real world impact on players
[3:31:04] SkrrtRussel: FeelsDankMan no no no its broken
[3:31:05] LoonerFlare: All they have to do is add a GCD
[3:31:06] LoonerFlare: Thats it
[3:31:06] Kawjiryu: It doesnt need to be fixed lol. Its just a cool niche macro
[3:31:09] Therealbrokensword: it also puts both of your movement abilities on CD
[3:31:10] spiritcheese: its 1 spec .. let them fun YEP
[3:31:11] LoonerFlare: And the macro no longer works
[3:31:12] 2Bs_tasty_feet: Remove all rogues RAGEY
[3:31:14] i_Static: this is a nothing burger
[3:31:17] huntercreeper54: macro is WICKED for me just keep it cause it's cool
[3:31:19] CalionHut: the cursor input should apply after the shadowstep
[3:31:19] Melati: Just delete player cursor from screen
[3:31:20] TheZoningBro: Cast sequence macros are FAR worse and ruin the game.
[3:31:21] sashinh0: gabling on gcd, cause the travel time is close to an gdc in 80% of his usage anyways
[3:31:24] Somizzle: yes that be insane.
[3:31:24] LuciFeariUm: IGCD not putting step on the gcd
[3:31:25] belvedee: yes
[3:31:25] aithran: just kill the class ok
[3:31:25] pvalue01: rogues have too much shit off GCD
[3:31:25] nemziac: its not even a problem
[3:31:26] walmartpjs: no just make shadowstep and grapple share a gcd
[3:31:26] madhatterui: yes that would be terrible
[3:31:27] JERAULT: oh rogues would riot
[3:31:27] rami_rng: bro that would be awful
[3:31:27] tarth_100: he has a full stun rotation / damage kill window spell sequence macro too
[3:31:27] Roundhere_: i dont even see it as a problem
[3:31:28] nightst314: Shadowstep should put Hook on a at least 5 sec CD
[3:31:28] jamiboiy: you could just do it in reverse anyway right?
[3:31:28] kallisz: not warranted
[3:31:29] Darkestpenguin1: that would feel so bad
[3:31:29] Azikielboi: not a gcd, a shared cd between it and hook @Maximum
[3:31:30] Teshinator95: gcd on ss is stupid XD
[3:31:30] SketchyAkechii: Just a shared cd between hook and step 0.5sec @Maximum
[3:31:30] BigTrout3: the only kick when they're casting macro was actually broken. this is normal
[3:31:30] SkrrtRussel: a bit much
[3:31:30] LoonerFlare: yes
[3:31:31] zymmac: i dont think that macro needs fixing or is a problem
[3:31:33] Dherjee: There could be a separate GCD for movement skills
[3:31:34] VehxD: thatd be the MOST cooked way to solve it
[3:31:35] Azikielboi: a shared 1 sec cd betwen them
[3:31:35] isFeyz: it's not even an issue like he says, scuffs all your mobility.
[3:31:35] gwus: u wouldnt put it on step ud put 0.5sec gcd on grappling only after shadowstep or something
[3:31:36] NoneLikeTrynd: shadowstep gcd will remove the point of shadowstep kick
[3:31:36] valarbravoosi: that actually would feel horrible
[3:31:37] i_Static: not warranted
[3:31:37] ThisIsAsabel: Totally agree with you
[3:31:38] oonanilord: Imagine a player without this macro, I swear to god he will be kicked out of the group.
[3:31:38] zenkodac: ikr this is so inoffensive when there are insane macros out there
[3:31:38] kjlor: get rid of focus target
[3:31:39] kiriuped: They're saying put Shadowstep & Hook on GCD when one is used
[3:31:39] nayrcraig: Not a GCD, a CD between the mobility spells
[3:31:40] zubulluu: Add a gcd to hook only if you step
[3:31:40] Cjpriest: not on shadowstep you make shadowstep and grapple share it
[3:31:41] Aquadriel: shadowstep is on gcd in SoD and feels like shit @Maximum
[3:31:41] Mitune: nah a gcd shared between shadow and hook only
[3:31:42] Eraiiko: Did you watch pikaboo react on macros ? @maximum
[3:31:43] MajorFrog225: remove rogues
[3:31:43] Big_Mikk: it should not be possible to cast 2 spell with one click
[3:31:43] ShowDUH: @Maximum not put a gcd on SS, just a shared one so SS and hook can't be used at the same time
[3:31:44] Jovent2: @Maximum SS and grappling hook share GCD only with themselves...
[3:31:45] yeahp0n: well adding a GCD will never feel good
[3:31:45] LoonerFlare: Breaking cursor macros wouldnt be too good either
[3:31:46] khebul: The obvious solution is to remove PvP
[3:31:46] Diazanite: any of those 3 spells on the gcd would feel like turbo dogshit
[3:31:48] Sulm: not a blanket GCD, but a shared one between step and grappling @Maximum
[3:31:48] grozzarr: I got macros thats like a bunch of lines
[3:31:48] TheZoningBro: @Maximum Cast sequence macros are way crazier.
[3:31:49] faythes68: worst would be put kick or cc in the gcd
[3:31:50] karkarnarnar: chat: you can have 1 spell not on GCD with any number of spells that are off.
[3:31:50] andaroo: Rogue macro broken? Should probably delete Augmentation Evoker
[3:31:50] headgrumble: maybe share gcd with only hook
[3:31:50] sabaron: dude doesnt even think its a good macro KEKW
[3:31:52] grimzero617: No they haven't gone too far
[3:31:54] LOLdotCOM: INSANE macro LUL
[3:31:54] Helo_KiX: "not gonna drag the video" too late
[3:31:54] ThebluesBilly: @Maximum wait until is response LUL
[3:31:54] Nekz3: It's on GCD in SoD and people hate it
[3:31:55] Lindyn773: @Maximum just have a GCD between mobility. like a .5 delay between being able to step and being able to hook
[3:31:56] LoonerFlare: just make hook and shadow share
[3:31:56] Cakerinotv: @Maximum they already have some spells that can be used in tandem that arent on the gcd specific spells have a buffer cast time anyway
[3:31:57] Ariesui: Swifty had a one shot macro and to correct that one they put everything on a GCD in BfA
[3:31:58] SideOf6: there are macros that you can spam and only kick if there is a cast
[3:31:59] Old_Tomatoes: There are more ridiculous macros
[3:31:59] GearzxGaming: That is complete insanity?
[3:32:00] cheese_beaver: xdd
[3:32:01] bladenkurama: it just feels like cheating
[3:32:01] nate54881: imagine being mad about and at curser
[3:32:01] Falzyker: Shaman 1 button kill
[3:32:03] JERAULT: "i dont want to draw out the video. here it is one more time"
[3:32:05] ta_kov: Remove player cursor. Its too much design xdd
[3:32:09] squarepusher_: People complaining about addons losing their shit over two decade old macro syntax.
[3:32:10] aMoteofCosmicTruth: remove outlaw rogue or delete macros entirely is probably the only fix xdd
[3:32:10] gloomygl: INSAAAAANE MACRO ( its an @cursor macro )
[3:32:17] LuciFeariUm: @Maximum you wouldnt put step on GCD youd put a .5 second internal gcd on step&hook combo
[3:32:19] Blookie69: he hasnt said anything except "yeah" lmao
[3:32:19] CloudyHS: NOWAY
[3:32:20] texas_grizzly: My evoker soar/mount macro is more complicated than that lol
[3:32:24] yeyanow: I mean, you could do that and it would like a half second more?
[3:32:26] SkrrtRussel: LetHimJoel
[3:32:28] nemziac: @TheZoningBro not new tech tho, used some in wrath even

[3:34:22] barelyanonymous: the internet and guides are a huge part of that IMO
[3:34:23] dirtydeus: it is slightly catered to the 1%
[3:34:28] Cjpriest: nope
[3:34:28] zenkodac: how is someone want to be good make you feel bad, why do people care?!?
[3:34:29] LoonerFlare: sounds like this whole thing is just a boomer take from him to be honest
[3:34:29] Vigi9413: he's just not a wow player anymore nothing wrong with that just move on
[3:34:31] hxllxwgrave: @Starforkx so he can be 'good' again lol
[3:34:31] CloudyHS: yes
[3:34:31] 324bee21: people don't play games for FUN anymore they play to win.  It doesnt matter what it is or who its with
[3:34:31] lukurjd: hell yeah it is

[3:34:34] xpak___: thats just a getting old take lol
[3:34:35] papajigsaw: we've seen what happens in wow classic too, havent killed 7/7 of the sod raid 25 lvl? oh no you can not join sorry
[3:34:35] yeyanow: He wants to go back when he could fuck around and still be a top player
[3:34:36] Jorityxd: and thats ok
[3:34:36] Big_Mikk: player have change but the game didn't adapt

[3:34:43] spivet: m+ fucking BANGS. best wow has ever been by far
[3:34:43] odificiency: i mean, is he wrong tho? it's the same idea as pve. You need to freakin google, download addons, make up macros, do statistics etc before getting to playing the game. It's not fun getting good at the game right now. Compare to Lost Ark pvp, no gear, pick your points, get in, play, get good.
[3:34:44] Protoman_702: he does know single player games exist yeah

[3:34:48] Ravical75: he also was an extreme tryhard at one point though, no? i mean at one point he was what he considers the problem now

[3:34:49] noirlol: ICANT ICANT ICANT
[3:34:49] omgwatlol: classic is not built competitive and look how sweaty it is, it's not a wow problem
[3:34:49] harps71: people better than me at a game = sweaty

[3:35:14] BunnyMountain: i play SoD and i'm enjoying life :)
[3:35:14] i_Static: make everyone auto attack in a 40 man raid then asmon will come back!
[3:35:15] evolve124: +1

[3:35:23] PastMyLife357: I'm in a disc that is a group that's like that...just now started mythic but literally the approach of we give a shot cuz there's nothing left to do

[3:35:49] VRVento: is asmon just completely oblivious to how the world works in 2024. everything is about getting the most of something with the least investment @maximum
[3:35:49] noirlol: CAUGHT
[3:35:50] Merex760: I just wish they could figure out a mythic+ that didn't have a timer. I love hard content but I also wanna chill and not feel rushed
[3:35:50] fatlittlepaypig: i stopped watching him this year he's insufferable and has no life
[3:35:51] booznoon: 15 man raid would slap

[3:35:57] spiritcheese: huh
[3:35:59] gloomygl: I don't raid but just push M+ by myself without a guild and I'm having a blast, he's just a wow boomer trying to deflect why he doesn't enjoy wow anymore

[3:36:07] Protoman_702: its such a hard point to make go play wotlk and try and lvled then join icc its much harder than lvling and joining lfr/normal so you can experience a raid
[3:36:09] Drivesty: Clearing heroic once a week with a bunch of other dads is the most fun I have in this game
[3:36:09] Moochie: that’s dumb.
[3:36:11] zenkodac: such a delusional take of people who clearly havent touched wow in so long
[3:36:12] LoonerFlare: hes a boomer
[3:36:14] Todo88: @Merex760 Actually 100% agree with that, it's why I hated M+

[3:37:01] holdenwook: Really glad you're saying all this. Asmon is soooo mad at WoW and it makes no sense. He speaks of it like an abusive ex or something.

[3:37:38] maplelost: that 5% hardcore twitter poll killed hardcore
[3:37:40] BigTrout3: like the Conan mmo
[3:37:41] Arrown4: I only play Classic/SoD but Retail is ahead of both for sure in total playerbase. Classic is just loud minority.
[3:37:42] Falzyker: People who play retail don't give a shit about polls or anything they just do their thing and are done with it

[3:38:02] vaironixx: @zubulluu true d4bad
[3:38:05] SkrrtRussel: most of them dont realize it
[3:38:07] ArcaneSyntax: Retail had more parses than Sod during phase 1 of SoD and the raid in SoD had half the reset time.

[3:38:35] LilSmashi: if only he doesnt talk about it lol
[3:38:39] gloomygl: no shit
[3:38:45] Cjpriest: retail is just a market that will always be way different than classic and will always have haters and vice versa
[3:38:45] Todo88: KEKW
[3:38:47] BigTrout3: if only .. jpcDespair

[3:39:03] DrBazingaSC: Then maybe he can just go talk about another game >.<
[3:39:03] Relyst: listen Max Im pissed Madge
[3:39:05] aMoteofCosmicTruth: thats very true, but he feels entitled to shit on the game every other day religiously
[3:39:05] Lyonidus: his editors love baiting with titles tho
[3:39:05] oonanilord: hi youtube
[3:39:05] Storken97: Max Madge
[3:39:06] BigTrout3: max killed AMZ. max killed retail wow Madge

[3:39:08] c10starburst: Aware
[3:39:09] Sathenus: and doesn't play the game
[3:39:10] Tomq0: thats so true
[3:39:11] Weslicus: cry about it
[3:39:12] cheados: true, they did the poll on all social media, it was the same result.  Also, he said that nothing has changed in wow in this video.  Asmond changed more than wow
[3:39:14] Gamerhcp: max why did you kill AMZ Madge
[3:39:17] vyrdianaa: he  was  against  the  game in  hfc  with his arms warrior guide
[3:39:23] Fannypackk: asmond is smart enough to clarify that its his opinion
[3:39:23] Storken97: max being mean to bald boomer Madge
[3:39:23] TheRealDivert: wait, he's jaded about wow?...I couldnt tell
[3:39:23] Kiqa__: damn first AMZ now Retail...
[3:39:25] 324bee21: Everyone wants to be back in 2006 or 2008 or whenever
[3:39:27] rottisxd: you both lost mmo streamer award so you are as popular as he is Kappa
[3:39:34] yeyanow: No one is making asmon react to this
[3:39:34] Peber555: THD Susge
[3:39:35] CloudyHS: bellular OMEGALUL
[3:39:36] Falzyker: He's a sad old man wanting to go back to the old days
[3:39:37] Riberson1: nothing
[3:39:38] Aegrial: max killed amz.  Madge
[3:39:39] barelyanonymous: he even says "the game isn't for me anymore" Sadge
[3:39:40] noirlol: ye he is Delusional
[3:39:40] Turkeypitz: 100% he's catering to a group that feel the same way though
[3:39:41] fuchai: if the changes the game has made were good for the game wouldnt that mean the player base would stop leaving though?
[3:39:48] i_Static: jadedgold is just a react Andy now
[3:39:52] dreadwolf_irl: Tomorrow on the news, Asmons reaction video , to Max's reaction video, of his video.
[3:39:55] kallisz: among the retail players you would win the popularity contest, but nostalgic is a powerful thing, majority of all players stop playing a game after a while
[3:39:57] sabaron: hey man rage bait videos are big business
[3:39:59] gwenmh: max ur gonna get thumbnailed so hard buddy
[3:40:00] mana123: pre damage control xdd
[3:40:05] Roundhere_: get him on the poddyc
[3:40:11] fatlittlepaypig: it takes a lot of self development and growing up to realize watching him is a waste of time
[3:40:12] greenmachine11235: I mean I'm no doctor if I go spew BS about medicine everyone would agree that's fundamentally wrong. Same thing here, he doesn't play, doesn't interact with the game, so he shouldn't be talking about it
[3:40:13] tykus21: Nah, i agree with asmon a decent bit, but THIS video , hardly at all
[3:40:13] Gamerhcp: hardcore OMEGALUL
[3:40:15] Weslicus: i wonder why people relate with him over you strange
[3:40:17] Iconic_k: retail kinda mid right now, it's way too easy to gear.
[3:40:17] noirlol: hardcore??? ICANT
[3:40:20] biglonelytv: YEP
[3:40:21] maplelost: only clowns listen to Asmongold for WoW; I listen to bellular like a real wow player

[3:40:29] Gamerhcp: gacha game
[3:40:30] pvalue01: he says the game isnt made for him, but said he enjoyed legion, which really was only more hardcore than current?
[3:40:30] ookazzi: AYAYA
[3:40:30] vaironixx: literally autobattler
[3:40:31] neugassh: mobile game

[3:40:31] yeyanow: I heard it was good
[3:40:32] Roundhere_: he said M+ was bad cause it can scale to infinity
[3:40:32] gigaerick: @Maximum nah i think it's become more casual now that you don't need to grind artifact power anymore
[3:40:33] kallisz: asmon is not a hardcore gamer, he plays the most nonchalant games and i respect it
[3:40:34] DetoreMore: go take talk with asmon 😂
[3:40:35] noirlol: you dont have to engage in "hardcore" tho
[3:40:35] i_Static: so has every game ever
[3:40:35] burlin_: AYAYA
[3:40:37] PastMyLife357: you can have fun in the game IF you want to have fun; otherwise you'll hate it regardless of what they do
[3:40:37] veiloflonelystars: it is but in a bad way system wise and that community post shows how
[3:40:37] brokik1: dad guilds exist. you can just play in a dad guild
[3:40:38] 324bee21: He is right about that, my sister and brother in law don't play anymore because they got sick of not being "good enough," in dungeons
[3:40:38] PvtCheese: There are way more systems than there used to be. I know coming back mid Season 3 trying to figure out what I needed to craft alone was crazy
[3:40:39] Razdruid: FOUR HUNDRED AND THREE HOURS THO?
[3:40:41] bilboswaginzz305: Some goddamn weeb shit if you ask me
[3:40:41] booznoon: he definitely does have a problem being hardcore nowadays, all he does is react
[3:40:42] cylindere: actually a pretty good rpg
[3:40:42] JWallace: tons people play the game super casually and are happy
[3:40:43] DubakuMatumbo: Good game

[3:41:13] HeffaBear: i am in misery
[3:41:13] kallisz: calling blizzard a pop artist is crazy
[3:41:14] Powzoar: So WoW joined The Voice? Explains it, my mom know what it is
[3:41:15] Watajoke: INTRESTING COOK
[3:41:17] grozzarr: my hearts a stereo
[3:41:18] i_Static: good analogy tbh
[3:41:21] kaydenqt: Ion is Adam levine revealed
[3:41:25] quorra112: songs about jane is still a top album
[3:41:27] quorra112: holy fuck
[3:41:29] quorra112: bangers only
[3:41:31] mfalc: his hours are inflated cause he leaves the game on
[3:41:31] fuchai: So why are they bringing back systems that were in the game awhile ago?
[3:41:33] McGovy: WoW = Maroon 5
[3:41:34] Tidget: Look at the battlepass standard now
[3:41:37] kallisz: but people love palworld
[3:41:39] Todo88: Just gotta find a guild that caters to your needs
[3:41:39] Gamerhcp: WhoLetHimJoel
[3:41:40] JustRewind: Nah it hit
[3:41:46] scrubbybubbles42: CAUGHT
[3:41:48] Gloriance: This Love
[3:41:49] Bigwes46: Theres also 100s of content creators making videos on how to play before it releases
[3:41:50] DecayedmiNt: That would have to exist, we cant turn back time to go back to that gaming era
[3:41:52] ToiGosu: mmo need time to cook to get good these days hard to beat the old ones and the attention span is too short for players to wait
[3:41:54] ThePencilShow: Payphone being wrath
[3:41:54] Runningshuh: I think it comes with an aging player base. Im in my early 20's and i love all the new features/systems retail has compared to classic
[3:41:57] Sanctos304: i understood that reference
[3:42:00] yeyanow: Can't wait for wow to do a terrible superbowl halftime show
[3:42:01] gloomygl: self glaze classic
[3:42:04] rhyzandz: please title the yt clip WoW is like Maroon 5

[3:42:08] Fannypackk: Fannypackk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! delete bagnon shit addon
[3:42:09] Diazanite: did maroon 5 come out with another banger album
[3:42:09] fatlittlepaypig: because they cant work at walmart
[3:42:13] Themselves: true it all comes back to ur tierlists max. fuck u
[3:42:14] NotD4k: NAHH
[3:42:15] cravecrate: they added too many catch up mechanics and made the game like you said a seasonal "reset" like game
[3:42:16] maplelost: PTR gang
[3:42:17] NotD4k: add NAHH mods
[3:42:17] kallisz: actually the new games now that pops off are indy games that are just fun, they die fast af though
[3:42:19] Cjpriest: they should definitely get rid of super in depth PTRs
[3:42:20] zenkodac: the time sink that is classic is much hardcore imo then the challenge in wow, to play classic you literally have to no life it
[3:42:22] misran: wow is in a unique position because it's 20 yrs old, most games simply don't exist long enough to go through that kind of evolution
[3:42:23] Powzoar: I love guides lol
[3:42:24] veiloflonelystars: i think the endgame would be better if blizz took some advice from the community post
[3:42:25] jjwallababy: @Runningshuh also at 23, same
[3:42:25] Themselves: true it all comes back to ur tierlists max. fuck u, u ruined my gaming experience RageyBoom

[3:42:40] Diazanite: @NotD4k link it
[3:42:43] biglonelytv: retail sure is somethin
[3:42:44] c10starburst: Professional Content Creator HAHA
[3:42:49] orestes____: people want to play efficiently and not waste time.  People don't have time to fuck around learning a game anymore

[3:42:51] DeeterDo: bro whats your take on "fated" seasons being labeled an content @Maximum
[3:42:52] Powzoar: @Maximum have you ever thought of doing a dog tierlist?
[3:42:53] Diazanite: the council will decide if it gets added
[3:42:55] NotD4k: @Diazanite looking for it
[3:42:58] DeeterDo: as*

[3:43:21] Arcinatos: we need more tier lists
[3:43:23] zubulluu: We still do that on d3
[3:43:23] Slapsstick: I just ignore all the creators and game anyway Shruge
[3:43:24] Todo88: I imagine that's how most people engage with games tbh
[3:43:25] darkgigaz: I do that still
[3:43:26] spivet: @itsBdaws I literally don't know, I just game and number go up
[3:43:26] Gamerhcp: check discord
[3:43:27] Monsuno: Playing Last Epoch blind is so fun
[3:43:27] Razdruid: that is only you chosing to do that tho
[3:43:29] zubulluu: d4bad though
[3:43:30] kallisz: big company games are mostly hardcore, but i think that generally people look for fun games, indy games are popping off
[3:43:31] Postone_: I heard somewhere that content creation is the hardest job
[3:43:31] fuchai: the moment blizz started taking the RPG out of wow the game started dying, numbers dont lie
[3:43:33] richie918: some specs play the same way for the entire DF expansion when Shadow priests got 8 reworks
[3:43:34] dirtydeus: sounds like last epoch
[3:43:35] cornflakezza: kingdom Heart 4
[3:43:35] kravmagaga: playing both retail and classic i wish i could get the raiding with the homies vibe for decent gear without the content being so challenging for the boomer friends
[3:43:38] Madgeneto: if you want to do that you can still do that tho...
[3:43:38] Roen: why did you say discord like that
[3:43:39] Gamerhcp: i wasnt telling you
[3:43:39] Roen: take it back

[3:43:40] Jombinoo: Meta gaming everything
[3:43:42] Gamerhcp: i was telling diaz
[3:43:42] Welsy_: check deez nuts
[3:43:43] NotD4k: @Diazanite ***
[3:43:44] PastMyLife357: the thing is; you CAN still play like that...if you aren't having fun playing a game; that's def on you.
[3:43:46] Arcinatos: THIS KÅRD
[3:43:47] SniggleJake572: @fuchai dumbest take ever

[3:44:10] slugg_tk: joel skype
[3:44:16] Themselves: garf
[3:44:17] Keglett: joel get on skype
[3:44:17] BigTrout3: just play shit that's fun
[3:44:19] JustRewind: Content creation isnt the problem, but it has changed the landscape and feel. You can't capture the old nostalgic feel because of like you said the presence of social media and min/max efficiency. When content creation and social media make the game easier, the developer has to make it harder for people hwo like a challenge.
[3:44:20] gloomygl: frag
[3:44:21] fatlittlepaypig: maybe ventrilo

[3:45:50] MaybeRespect: A bit unfair. I love WoW, because iv'e played it since 2008, and I want it to be great. Criticizing it's current meta chasing status does not mean mentally ill.
[3:45:51] misran: bla
[3:45:52] fatlittlepaypig: hes not passionate about a game he doesnt play
[3:45:53] gloomygl: AINTNOWAY NAHH

[3:46:25] huntercreeper54: passion mean you like it but it could be better, when you don't like anything it's not passion
[3:46:29] deadie3D: asmon is just describing vanilla wow, not retail
[3:46:33] luzcius: garf garf garf
[3:46:36] SniggleJake572: so def talking about asmon KEKW
[3:46:36] riels__: @Themselves kinda true ngl
[3:46:36] sabaron: so much of it really is about the people you played with
[3:46:37] LoonerFlare: thats obsession
[3:46:38] Azikielboi: if you say "ill never play wow again" but keep on complaining about wow constantly thats werid
[3:46:38] uncred95: lack of meds
[3:46:38] dumplings88: thats literally asmon LUL
[3:46:39] Llarrow: I honestly feel like Asmon wouldnt even talk about wow if he wasnt a react streamer/ his chat always encouraging it
[3:46:40] Zanpander00: fixation
[3:46:41] shawkeem: did you like dune? i thought it was a literal 10
[3:46:43] MaybeRespect: That's a lot less people than you think. Loud minority.
[3:46:44] Themselves: asmon described vanilla wow but he won't play SOD or vanilla wow garf
[3:46:45] LoonerFlare: 100% obsession
[3:46:45] mestarvirus: i think u reading into too much, he is a streamer and just milks wow andys
[3:46:48] oonanilord: @MaybeRespect everybody wants the good old days that's not wrong
[3:46:48] charliezarrdd: ppl dont know how to handle loss
[3:46:50] eyeztea: i miss the days when asmongold and belurar didnt make videos
[3:46:50] yeahp0n: its like star wars and marvel haters

[3:47:08] aMoteofCosmicTruth: especially if you are considered to have a voice big enough to influence the uninformed
[3:47:09] P3ntaskill: his chat brings it up yea, you are right
[3:47:12] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: frag
[3:47:13] prochewie: Passion vs. obsession. Some don't see a difference
[3:47:14] MaybeRespect: @oonanilord Well Maxx being a bit bias towards coitizing the game...
[3:47:17] hapjaa: tell me what to think BatChest
[3:47:17] Switchblade142: I’ve been complaining about my ex I haven’t seen in once the past 3 years, I’m not insane I’m just passionate about her and want her to be better
[3:47:17] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: firstgarf
[3:47:18] fronkacean: it is funny to rebrand from the "elitist" to the "wow is too elitst"
[3:47:22] Elseworldz: @eyeztea TBC then?
[3:47:25] valarbravoosi: some weird form of validation?
[3:47:26] PleaseLessen: It also gets mega views so he is going to keep doing it
[3:47:30] Azikielboi: its like fox news viewers, the viewers FEED on the anger and hatred
[3:47:30] Negativityxd: parrot my opinion streamer AYAYA
[3:47:30] Destrolisher: @MaybeRespect coitizing
[3:47:32] Azikielboi: they NEEEEED it
[3:47:36] AtCollins: Asmon is based asf tbh
[3:47:40] Madgeneto: it's still what he does do
[3:47:40] Saintlel: Asmon is a grifter, he flip flops and changes constantly to cater to his volatile fanbase, I don't think he's constantly invested in the game, but having "hot takes" gets clicks
[3:47:44] Todo88: xdd
[3:47:45] Tomq0: You think they will bring something new in fated or we will have SL 2.0
[3:47:46] spivet: @fronkacean everyone is washed eventually, some respond to it better than others
[3:47:47] BrandonAUS: KEKW
[3:47:47] fatlittlepaypig: OMEGALUL
[3:47:47] Arcinatos: farming the anti wow andys AND the ff14 andys just makes his YT vids pop off hard
[3:47:47] brainrot_behavior: xdd
[3:47:48] pvalue01: the fact that he said WoW isn't for him anymore, yet enjoyed Legion seems like a turbo contradiction

[3:48:03] hxllxwgrave: LUL
[3:48:04] aMoteofCosmicTruth: i swear i said this in his chat previously xdd
[3:48:09] GnarstyTV: Asmon needs to have Goggins live with him for a week. I’d pay 3 months salary for that content easy.
[3:48:09] Aegrial: fuckin true
[3:48:14] dirtydeus: he does mold the opinions of many for wow @maximum
[3:48:21] kallisz: he played uldir
[3:48:22] HarmlessCurse: he played BfA and Shadowlands
[3:48:23] sabaron: legion is when his guild fell apart
[3:48:24] Arrown4: @Saintlel He had problems with his teeth and wiped the blood from them on his wall instead of dealing with it. Nobody should take any takes seriously from him
[3:48:24] Starforkx: i'd argue there is a big difference between saying "wow is bad" and "i dont like wow right now" sure it's more to throw out, but dayum
[3:48:25] maplelost: didnt he stop in Shadowlands
[3:48:28] tutizz_: all for content, would have done the same as him tbh
[3:48:29] fuchai: last time he played was legion?
[3:48:32] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: is wow ok to start now for a month ?\
[3:48:33] huntercreeper54: but it also mean legion made him quit the game @Maximum
[3:48:33] Todo88: Uldir was my first raid and I loved it
[3:48:34] Themselves: 9.1 xdd
[3:48:35] riels__: he played a lot of shadowlands wym
[3:48:37] Weslicus: legion did not start bad
[3:48:37] CloudyHS: BASED
[3:48:38] kallisz: @HarmlessCurse not rly
[3:48:39] fuchai: he played in DF
[3:48:39] codydoubleu: yeah he still mained the game until shadowlands
[3:48:40] brentosxd: u forget about shadowlans my man
[3:48:40] Llarrow: Legion was the last time he went hard. after that hes just been casual
[3:48:41] ocicatthedruid: Shadowlands is when he really stopped, not Legion
[3:48:47] P3ntaskill: its like when ppl ask jordan what he thinks about the current state of basketball, his opinion is out dated but has some bases so ppl cling to it
[3:48:47] Ivaed: WoW isn't for anyone anymore except for sweaty try hards who want to epeen all over themselves IMO
[3:48:48] St0rmwhisper: Also people remember fondly Legion and forget the whole f artifact power issue
[3:48:52] MangoAndKiwi: not for me, i liked legion way more than bfa and sl but i did mostly pvp
[3:48:55] kiriuped: @fuchai DEF not.
[3:48:55] grimzero617: BFA had one hell of a glow up after 8.2
[3:49:02] みょせつ: DF was giga fun to me
[3:49:02] darkgigaz: He played in DF, did keys with Dorki
[3:49:04] j_bar111: Solo Queue
[3:49:05] foobis_25: same
[3:49:05] fatlittlepaypig: yea it's easy to queue up but solo shuffle queues take forever
[3:49:06] uncred95: @Ivaed take your meds
[3:49:07] Gorakk82: we need legion lego fixed, bfa ap fixed, SL covenants fixed
[3:49:09] MaybeRespect: @Starforkx yeah I guess problem people have is it keeps going down the same road
[3:49:09] shinta__: pvp gearing is so eaasy now, I love it
[3:49:13] CloudyHS: @darkgigaz you mean he got carried by dorki?
[3:49:16] みょせつ: s1 was the best time ever
[3:49:22] berchberkins: this season has been pain to play an alt so i havnt enjoyed it as much
[3:49:22] PirateBob_: i liked shadowlands, shoot me
[3:49:23] maplelost: we hyped for season 4 or what
[3:49:23] Gorakk82: people will play then

[3:49:31] CloudyHS: CAUGHT
[3:49:32] Dicath: Sure
[3:49:33] Hannes_tf: DF was okay, the problem with wow imo is the world feels dead and it's just sit in hub and wait for queue pop
[3:49:34] richie918: why would you like season 3
[3:49:35] P3ntaskill: Kappa
[3:49:35] HatterzHC: @maplelost not really

[3:49:38] trentbail23: @CloudyHS a bit but asmon did tank 25s
[3:49:38] rukt: he knows ruktAmogus
[3:49:39] Phil4242: I've never had a better time in M+ then in Dragonflight
[3:49:40] dirtydeus: I’m not a fan of fated seems like a cop out
[3:49:41] GooseComics: @Maximum After having Venruki on PoddyC talking about PVP, ever thought about bringing non combat streamers to talk about the game, like AH only players, Collectors, altoholics etc? Would be interesting to hear what others think of the state of the game.
[3:49:41] Diazanite: @kiriuped he did one aberrus raid at the very least
[3:49:41] Oracle_WoW: seems like a terrible way to end a great expansion
[3:49:41] Razdruid: okay mr get classes nerfed

[3:49:41] Slapsstick: CAUGHT
[3:49:42] Christofuhr: I don't think Blizzard are capable of balancing for you guys and literally everyone else.  They have literally never been able to do it and not a single person in any guild I've ever been in enjoys wiping for 7+ weeks on an end boss @Maximum
[3:49:43] huntercreeper54: i find most of the raid boss this expansion to be mid
[3:49:43] lastericalive: leak
[3:49:43] AtCollins: Does your chat always lean towards dunking on Asmon? Like, I significantly enjoy both of your guys content. Seems super black and white in here
[3:49:44] ectocantaim: CAUGHT we eating good boys confirmed
[3:49:44] Osterberg501: You know DF is good, when people think it's good during the expansion. Usually takes a few years for expansions to be seen as good.

[3:49:48] AnarchyMoose: it cant be exactly like it was last time
[3:49:48] Sothis_best_girl: hopefully
[3:49:48] spivet: @PirateBob_ shadowlands was hype once covenant switching wasn't annoying
[3:49:49] PvtCheese: Feel like Season 1 is always kinda shit then over time they start implementing what the community wants and by end of 2/start of 3 it gets good
[3:49:49] JustRewind: DF was my first expansion, and I loved it.
[3:49:51] Sancrosanct: I think its crazy that pikaboo did every spec in pvp last season.
[3:49:54] TSmarine: esfandYou esfandAre esfandDead
[3:49:54] JWallace: what’s 10.2.6 max, you can spill the beans, I won’t tell anyone

[3:49:56] richie918: they are not cooking at all ever since season 1
[3:49:57] R35pecto: imo thats the problem, its the same as legion, it was fun back then cuz it was new and inovative, but theres nothing new
[3:49:57] Niral1241: dragonflight has been really fun when there wasnt a perfect meta comp that only allowed them into keys
[3:49:58] s_thetic_steve: i was hopeful for a d4 gauntlet cook and it was undercooked for sure
[3:49:58] Runningshuh: he knows
[3:50:01] seen7037: surely they will I will suck that copium
[3:50:01] Rattboy22: He normally plays at start of xpacs and then will try again in later seasons but he will not really play much and makes up his opinion and dips out
[3:50:02] Aegrial: I can’t see how s4 can be more engaging but I have some hope

[3:50:41] Runningshuh: just lie to us then
[3:50:42] Monsuno: That's how Flat Earth theory works
[3:50:42] PirateBob_: that is what you would say
[3:50:42] kravmagaga: okay but whats the pirate tea
[3:50:42] Gamerhcp: CAUGHT
[3:50:43] ta_kov: @Maximum as a player who plays it on and off im hyped for simple fated
[3:50:43] greenmachine11235: Sounds like max got in trouble for hinting that awesome things were coming
[3:50:43] mcphatty: fated has a new hero class for DH
[3:50:43] Valkrien09876: idk what the general consensus is about the content of wow but i am pretty new, started playing like early January and i've done like most of everything that i can really do for the season while being full time student. like i feel like there is just nothing left to really do
[3:50:45] MaybeRespect: @Starforkx Yeah I mean, nothing we say in twitch chat will reach the devs tbh :P
[3:50:45] porteus: SUSSY
[3:50:45] spivet: someone who knows something would say they cant say anything
[3:50:45] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Is it true we are getting a new class in 10.2.6?
[3:50:45] GameteTV: its a mini raid only reason he would know
[3:50:46] Docaan: that is exactly what someone who knows would say
[3:50:46] Sothis_best_girl: wait
[3:50:47] MangoAndKiwi: Susge he knows
[3:50:47] Therealbrokensword: Exactly
[3:50:47] zenkodac: no Kappa

[3:50:51] vaironixx: its gonna be vampire survivors in 10.2.6
[3:50:53] grimzero617: Hey @maximum , you're such a handsome guy. Now give me the info
[3:50:53] bezelgames: @Maximum dude u literally have to dedicate a full-time job worth of hours to get to an elite level in wow. thats why i stopped playing.
[3:50:54] Sithandra_Li: sokkzvYEP sokkzvYEP sokkzvYEP
[3:50:55] daevyfan: gn
[3:50:56] riels__: personally, i think asmon's take on WoW is really reasonable. retail is not enjoyable in most aspects. end game is about the only thing it has going for it. and even that is just a grind gear fest
[3:50:57] Sothis_best_girl: doesn't this mean we're not getting S4 alongside 10.2.6? @Maximum
[3:50:57] AtCollins: @maximum Does your chat always lean towards dunking on Asmon? Like, I significantly enjoy both of your guys content. Seems super black and white in here
