[0:17:25] Lausten: Live maintenance is not wow related, its battle dot net related @yuldovah42
[0:17:32] physalis4: Are they trying to get all the other events out of the way before they give us 10.2.6?
[0:17:50] MediumRareOG: all i know is i have 88 toons ready to do the comp stomp weekly
[0:18:34] ratgefingah: technically the hs event is still under 10.2.5 on the roadmap
[0:18:40] bomayaa: hey dan, do you know why blizz  ports your alt out of chromie time at level 61? I can understand they want you to play through current content but when you have laods of alts, it's tiring

[0:22:26] bojackhorseman2004: i expect S4 to come in a month
[0:22:32] bojackhorseman2004: and alpha should be before
[0:22:32] NeeK_23: @MrGM thanks for the nudge to try kyrian event again. I ent and smashed out all the achievements in one night, got 2 more mounts and loads of tmog. wouldnt have bothered if you hadnt reminded me
[0:22:41] fetza108: shadowlands content PogO

[0:22:56] MachoCham: I need to lurk as I'm transcribing a video and I really don't want to put shadowlands in the instructions KEKW
[0:23:06] michaelmm: I'm expecting S4  towards the end of April maybe start of May
[0:23:33] michaelmm: It's the same length window as Season 1 and 2 were (20-24 weeks)
[0:23:47] michaelmm: More likely S4 will be shorter than S3 will be IMO.
[0:24:13] yuldovah42: it was 12 weeks
[0:24:21] michaelmm: SL S4 was 4 .5 months. I'm kinda expecting this S4 to be even shorter..
[0:24:22] Shrandamar: S4 length depends how quickly we're getting 11.0 I guess
[0:24:25] Layliah79: mrgmHelloThere Happy Monday all!
[0:24:33] bojackhorseman2004: what is that event?
[0:24:47] nash25pl: uft ! what a day the company meeting was wild this month !!!  Hows your day @MrGM
[0:24:57] fetza108: chat, when they release 10.2.6.?
[0:25:02] michaelmm: I have a feeling they will just give us a date an no more info about it.
[0:25:05] Layliah79: there are already achievements for it in retail if it gives any  hints
[0:25:10] nash25pl: we been told that company is taking workers to alton tower in june !
[0:25:26] michaelmm: I'm expecting either a pirate survivors thing, or some kind of pirate based invasion world event.
[0:25:30] Pumba2988: Hearthstone i thought you only play WoW?
[0:26:21] NeeK_23: I know youre doing SL 100%, but is it worth doing Darkmoon Faire ATT whilst its up?
[0:26:21] Pumba2988: They finally merging hearthstone into the taverns in game that would be cool
[0:26:32] Lausten: Lets go to the Maw! Today! KEKW
[0:26:39] MediumRareOG: dmf is up, yes
[0:26:52] nash25pl: @MrGM priorties anima conductor for faster anima gain as it increases amount of anima you gain from WQ and rares around SL zones
[0:27:04] MediumRareOG: you do a million dmf quests
[0:27:07] NeeK_23: do lots of games
[0:27:14] Layliah79: doing the profession quests, the turn in items..
[0:27:22] Lausten: Before you had quests for professions you were to hand in decks back in the day, it was expensive as fuck
[0:27:30] nash25pl: no matter what you do u have to grind the maw
[0:27:34] MediumRareOG: if you do all the dmf dailies every day, it takes 3-4 dmfs to get exalted
[0:27:40] Layliah79: think there is 9 turn-in items. you can buy from AH if you don't have any.
[0:27:53] NeeK_23: venari daily with DMF buff too remember
[0:28:23] nash25pl: venari :puke:
[0:28:43] MediumRareOG: does tormentors of torghast give venari rep? i forget

[0:29:02] NeeK_23: so when i was doing the achievements, there is one for killing 20 spiders. a tip, you have to kill with abilities not walking over them. took me a few attempts to realise
[0:29:28] NeeK_23: yeah Ectetha boss
[0:30:34] invictus_DK: how do i get all r3 recipe for all BFA blacksmith stuff? how to get marks of honor?

[0:37:14] Elrathir: A secret admirer
[0:37:15] Ckraigfriend: did you buy the hats for the buff

[0:39:11] michaelmm: I vaguely recall it gives rep for the covenant.
[0:39:12] bojackhorseman2004: its so intresting seeing you enjoy SL and the maw so much while everyone hated on it so much
[0:39:29] michaelmm: Forget it there's venari rep too.
[0:39:33] MediumRareOG: remember when you could only do souls collection once a week?
[0:39:48] NeeK_23: does zygor have venari rep guide?
[0:39:55] Bware2: once you could mount in the maw, the zone wasnt that bad
[0:40:10] Zenison: It's  a lot better when you can mount, and don't have a kill limit per day lol
[0:40:14] coowen: i dont mine beeing in maw now either, just block the out the old ptsd from that place :D
[0:40:16] bojackhorseman2004: Well, i keep hearing people complain about every expansion and patch. Not sure if i can take things serious anymore
[0:40:20] Odinslayer: the maw? is it 2020 again O_O why you torturing yourself on purpose my man
[0:40:23] bojackhorseman2004: the devs must be crying xD
[0:40:35] illidarii_: FREE PALESTINE
[0:40:51] MachoCham: I love all the hot takes on Shadowlands = bad
[0:40:53] NeeK_23: current thing is always worst thing in wow to some players LuL
[0:40:55] bojackhorseman2004: How awsome wouldnt it be that when you 100% the maw you get a secret questline to visit sylvanas
[0:40:58] invictus_DK: what do you get from that rep?
[0:41:05] MachoCham: What next edge lords will be saying that they enjoyed Wrath?
[0:41:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:41:15] Odinslayer: jeez @MachoCham remember when we had to RUN through the zone for over a year? that was great right?
[0:41:47] Lausten: I imagine that shes walking arround with a broom sweeping up all the mess she made..
[0:41:47] NeeK_23: thats a pet
[0:41:49] Bware2: maybe you already answered this many times, but did you play shadowlands on another char or? or you didnt do this during shadowlands?
[0:42:02] MachoCham: @Odinslayer It was what it was, overall it wasn't a bad expansion. Just more at the repeated rhetoric of it's bad gets a bit old tbf

[0:42:18] octnoir: At this time Anduin's out of the maw
[0:42:20] NeeK_23: Andy is wandering all over
[0:42:33] octnoir: cause there is this 'would you like to listen' dialogue in this current patch between genn and master shaw
[0:42:54] octnoir: *mathias shaw, why did i say master? jeez
[0:42:58] physalis4: Torghast is low key really fun just to go back to and blast everything
[0:43:03] Lausten: Theres a voice line between Genn and Shaw in Valdrakken talking about what Anduin is doing
[0:43:09] Zenison: @bojackhorseman2004 I think it was more to expand the story of the lich king rather than create a new one
[0:43:09] mrsrockguru: afternon @MrGM and chat

[0:44:43] Lausten: I honestly think you can do it in less than an hour now
[0:44:57] Lausten: I think I spend like 2-2.5 hours in SL
[0:45:24] mrsrockguru: Yes I think there are
[0:45:35] Odinslayer: @MachoCham even blizzard said its a bad expansion and they fucked up xD, i give you first season of the expansion was really great the m+ and pvp grind was great it was all new torghast etc but after that when 9.1 took over a year to come and season 2 was korthia the game was dead lets be real
[0:45:38] MuuskeWoW: there are souls yeah
[0:45:40] NeeK_23: i did it went restoshaman was bugged and acid rain killed the boss but didnt aggro them
[0:46:07] MediumRareOG: i did twisted corridors exactly once each to do level 8
[0:46:27] MachoCham: @Odinslayer As a collectionist and raiding I didn't find it that bad but I understand why people didn't enjoy it tbh
[0:46:30] BBMezzy: I get that too
[0:46:32] nash25pl: @MrGM get some magnesium tablet

[0:46:54] physalis4: potassium
[0:47:08] mrsrockguru: Bananas are high in potassium
[0:47:10] bojackhorseman2004: ye does sound like a vitamina mineral deficiency
[0:47:11] nash25pl: twiching in eye means u lack potasium or magnesium or too much caffine not enough sleep
[0:47:25] bojackhorseman2004: but what allot of gamers need is just to touch grass and get some sun
[0:47:28] AdamShwaginz: so british
[0:47:36] MachoCham: I bought some hot cross buns <3
[0:47:41] xmalthael02: I get an anxious twitch in my eye. Quite embarrassing people think im winking at them XD

[0:48:58] mrsrockguru: The Day the world breaks down by Aryeon is also excellent but 13mins long
[0:49:22] alicemch: love free bird
[0:49:24] Lausten: Did I hear you say you wanted to listen to oldies instead of this du dung dung music? LUL
[0:49:28] bojackhorseman2004: please dont sing >_<
[0:49:41] MediumRareOG: stairway to heaven is reasonably long
[0:50:17] MachoCham: As long as it's not the chav national anthem in Sweet Caroline. Makes my cringe cringe
[0:50:20] Lausten: @MediumRareOG You'd fall a sleep halfway through the shower if thats the shower song LUL
[0:50:21] invictus_DK: background noise could be nicer tho... no hate
[0:50:27] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:50:42] Layliah79: some of the best songs are super long - like Michael Jackson's Thriller
[0:50:52] Thoreya: music is always great, dont change it
[0:50:54] NeeK_23: the only nation anthem is Mr Brightside
[0:51:05] Ellizza: I've missed the maw, it brings back memories :)
[0:51:11] invictus_DK: i'm not a fan of du dung dung dung as well like @Lausten
[0:51:15] MediumRareOG: "no hate but i hate what you're doing" LUL
[0:51:19] Lausten: Its fine, it just gets a bit too repetitive for my brain sometimes..
[0:51:56] invictus_DK: MAW music ??
[0:52:02] MediumRareOG: @Ellizza who hurt you?
[0:52:03] MachoCham: Du dung dung dung? Is that the best of the Dung Beetles?
[0:52:04] Lausten: You're right about the lyrics though..
[0:52:04] phopheter: paid chatter
[0:52:17] invictus_DK: this music is the maw lol just Du Dung Dung Dung
[0:52:21] bojackhorseman2004: wait, you guys are getting paid to chatt?
[0:52:38] UK_Nathan: this music is great, nice and chill
[0:52:47] Layliah79: I'm here to listen to you and not the background noise EZ
[0:53:08] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming to the Trading Post in March 2024 | World of Warcraft - https://youtu.be/P5ptnvI6-t0
[0:53:19] coowen: how many mounts do u have?
[0:53:21] MediumRareOG: is it OTT that i'm levelling toons to 50 so i can create more evokers?
[0:53:35] Ellizza: @MediumRareOG my guildmaster :(
[0:53:44] NeeK_23: @MachoCham Du Du Du Hast, Du Hast Mich
[0:53:44] invictus_DK: wow music is pog not saying you need to change it but for chill content wow music is pretty pog
[0:54:08] Layliah79: worth it if it's brand new. won't have to replace things for a long time
[0:54:23] phopheter: that's good. how many bedrooms?
[0:54:56] Layliah79: 3 bedroom = 2 kids :D
[0:55:33] MediumRareOG: put in another 100k, get 5 extra bedrooms 5Head
[0:55:33] Layliah79: get the 4 bedroom. you could have an amazing stream room then
[0:55:36] MachoCham: But is it practical size for the increase in the bedroom?
[0:55:46] Lausten: 4 bedroom 2 kids + office?
[0:55:55] MachoCham: monkaS
[0:55:57] bojackhorseman2004: the only forever home is a coffin :(
[0:55:59] invictus_DK: Small army is the way to go
[0:56:00] MachoCham: I feel attacked
[0:56:06] Layliah79: @bojackhorseman2004 that's dark :(
[0:56:15] nash25pl: extra council tax for spare bed KEKW
[0:56:28] lyreilla: I would. You guys are young yet. IT's not a huge difference, so I would take the hit, but that is me.
[0:56:30] invictus_DK: Jeez that took a turn
[0:56:30] MachoCham: Ha SWERVE BRO i'm getting burnt
[0:56:34] MediumRareOG: I saw one of those Jamie Oliver shows up north where a family with 7 kids were packed into a 3 bedroom. 3 and 4 kids in each bedroom
[0:56:36] Lausten: @bojackhorseman2004 I prefer my bed a bit softer
[0:57:14] nash25pl: @MrGM extra tax only apply for council houses tho and people with benefits
[0:57:15] Layliah79: she could have a "girl room"
[0:57:16] nash25pl: so u gucci
[0:57:36] MediumRareOG: you need 5 kids so you have enough to do your warfronts
[0:57:38] Lausten: Might as well go for the extra bedroom now instead of having to move once more..
[0:57:40] Layliah79: idk if she does crafting and such
[0:57:43] MachoCham: As long as you're not sacrificing space on the other 3
[0:57:49] MachoCham: As you'll need a staircase
[0:58:14] MachoCham: Attic would be the perfect stream space
[0:59:00] Lausten: Sounds like when I wanted RGB lights, cant remember when I last changed the colors.. LUL
[0:59:07] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[0:59:53] Layliah79: extra bedroom could even be a storage room. seems like it's not much more $$ so the value might be worth it.
[1:00:27] MachoCham: Advertise on the wall for 1p per pixel!
[1:00:35] Lausten: Just need one of those Philips Hue Play boxes and it should be relatively easy to integrate
[1:00:53] bojackhorseman2004: yeah, or sleep in it if you got food posining and farting through the night. Which your parnter might not appriciate
[1:00:55] physalis4: Hue bulbs are awesome
[1:01:52] Lausten: I bought Hue for the entire apartment, and as I said, havent  changed the colors since maybe a month or 3 after getting them.. BUT I can make it all red in here to mimic a brothel Kappa
[1:02:19] ImperfectDark: hue is great. i used to change all the colours to red or green when i was watching a horror movie
[1:02:31] nash25pl: that 3 resets worth of rep
[1:02:46] coowen: how long will it take to get 100 souls?
[1:02:53] Layliah79: Luxthos was able to go all out with his stream setup once he moved. I can't wait to see what you come up with in your new house! :D
[1:02:56] Lausten: Yeah thats what the Hue Play Box is for, it can react to whats on the screen
[1:03:24] Layliah79: LED lights and all would be fun
[1:03:37] Layliah79: agreed!
[1:03:49] MachoCham: I'm a boomer, I don't get the LED obsession
[1:04:07] bojackhorseman2004: Tbh, i like the ones where they have plants or some natural stuff in the background than just a bunch of lights
[1:04:20] invictus_DK: I'm a boomer confirmed... just like @MachoCham
[1:04:23] Lausten: @MachoCham Since you're a boomer! Savings! LED > old light bulbs! ;)
[1:04:24] Layliah79: Bunten has lots of plants in her background
[1:04:25] fooxytv: Tali
[1:04:30] MachoCham: I don't want my room to look like the red light district
[1:04:34] BisonD: LEDs are the essential oils for gamers. Constantly being bombarded by stimuli
[1:04:36] databob1: Homely??
[1:04:39] MachoCham: Sorry not LED, RGB lighting
[1:05:09] databob1: Homey...Homely is ugly
[1:05:15] KaisenSiru: Pog
[1:05:27] invictus_DK: There is a youtuber Mathew Encina or something i love his setup with plants and shit
[1:05:37] Layliah79: Towelliee's setup isn't bad either.
[1:05:38] bojackhorseman2004: man, wouldnt it be awsoume to just replicate like a wow inn background
[1:05:40] bojackhorseman2004: as your background
[1:05:55] BBMezzy: If we're lucky we'll get a release date. They've been using the this week in WoW posts to announce dates
[1:06:17] bojackhorseman2004: wow dates?
[1:06:25] bojackhorseman2004: we have dates for comming patches?
[1:07:02] bojackhorseman2004: oh okey
[1:07:02] Layliah79: Week in Wow today!
[1:07:09] invictus_DK: There is bunch of people like that... I'm interior designer and used to do my setups like that
[1:07:16] bojackhorseman2004: gz'

[1:07:55] WochiTV: u making me want to do all the torghast achieve i am missing
[1:08:01] nash25pl: @MrGM just speed run it run to boss without killing shit or collecting anything out of a way
[1:08:01] invictus_DK: If you wanna see mine type Hitesh Dewasi DJTJ on youtube and click on 1st video
[1:08:04] nash25pl: that what i did
[1:08:24] Kimdah_: I did Twisting Corridors the other day, and just one floor took so long üò≠üò≠
[1:08:53] Kimdah_: Why did I choose to torture myself with Twisting Corridors? üò≠
[1:08:57] Layliah79: YES lol
[1:09:02] nash25pl: you dont have a perk sad
[1:09:04] Layliah79: so kit for a big then kill in pile
[1:09:06] KaisenSiru: Phantasma Pog
[1:09:06] physalis4: You can spec into the box to autoloot
[1:09:22] WochiTV: should be
[1:09:25] physalis4: Oh yeah. rip
[1:09:26] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:09:36] KaisenSiru: Thats correct, the box doesn't effect Twisting Corridor
[1:09:38] Layliah79: i'm still missing a few transmogs off the vendors in there.. one day i'll go back
[1:09:38] nash25pl: 5
[1:09:39] WochiTV: i think u had to loot cause there was a quest?
[1:09:41] Kimdah_: TC is a whole different kind of evil..
[1:09:46] WochiTV: ahhhh ok
[1:09:57] nash25pl: fuck TC that just shit part of SL KEKW
[1:10:22] Kimdah_: Peeling potatoes while watching you torture yourself willingly ü§£
[1:10:32] nash25pl: weekly callings = graceful offering so yes u want to do them
[1:10:41] KaisenSiru: devoTATODANCE
[1:10:44] Layliah79: i didn't mind Torghast. but i did it a lot with friends so made it more fun.
[1:11:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:11:09] databob1: delicious souls
[1:11:14] Layliah79: wonder if we can kill him yet? LOL
[1:11:25] michaelmm: I personally enjoyed the gameplay of torghast - it was the feeling of being forced to always do it for leggos that killed it for me.
[1:11:52] nash25pl: no
[1:11:52] MachoCham: yEP
[1:11:55] BisonD: 100%
[1:12:03] michaelmm: The gloomy aesthetic of the maw and torghast was a factor.
[1:12:05] MachoCham: If it had more variety and had less obligation
[1:12:07] handovdoom666: no, i didn't enjoy it because i was forced to do it
[1:12:12] dicemeister23: I loved torghast, I beat it as holy priest when it was current content
[1:12:16] MediumRareOG: as a hunter, torghast sucked because we had hardly any cool powers like other classes
[1:12:42] michaelmm: To a degree Torghast interiours felt a bit cut and paste visually.
[1:12:47] MediumRareOG: the doubling in pet size was nice. the only cool power was the fleshcraft bomb powers but they were super rare
[1:12:51] databob1: yes fill it with rainbows and puppies trying to murder you
[1:12:54] michaelmm: Imagine if we got 8 dungeons that all looks the same inside.
[1:12:56] KaisenSiru: Torghast, Islands, Delves Pog
[1:12:59] physalis4: @dicemeister23 you did what!? üòÆ
[1:13:25] KaisenSiru: Little mix of Pandaria 3 man scenarios too
[1:13:29] NIICKLAS_TV: NIICKLAS_TV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! yo yo yo
[1:13:42] MachoCham: That's what Blizzard has always traditionally done. Introduce a system in a patch and then iterate on it down the line
[1:13:46] MediumRareOG: in most of SL you could only do that souls quest once a week. more arbitrary time gating
[1:13:51] michaelmm: I hope they do apply the lessons learned from islands and Torghast - their record in extra game modes is..... not great.
[1:14:22] NIICKLAS_TV: im good! got a pay raise today so its a good day EZ
[1:14:30] MachoCham: I hope the one delve that is secret isn't tested
[1:14:44] MachoCham: And there are a few little bits that are hidden away
[1:14:52] physalis4: congrats @niicklas_tv
[1:15:17] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog
[1:15:25] NIICKLAS_TV: cata ResidentSleeper
[1:15:27] Ithylz: WoW already has issues WITH testing so imagine without it. Also having Story hidden is cool but gameplay, I'd rather have them test is as much as possible
[1:15:37] MachoCham: Imagine if they kept the Evoker starting zone hidden and it got released like it was originally
[1:15:47] MachoCham: Cata > Wrath. But I won't play it
[1:15:53] NIICKLAS_TV: ill play launch but thats about it
[1:16:58] fetza108: Wake me up when mop classic is out
[1:17:01] death_cam_: i would be more hyped for classic mop over classic cata tbh
[1:17:10] MediumRareOG: the tmog vendor is only in the normal torghast iirc
[1:17:13] NIICKLAS_TV: yes
[1:17:26] MachoCham: I will die on the hill that Cata is a great expansion tainted by Dragon Soul patch length
[1:17:36] NeeK_23: imagine if 10.2.6 is a new pirate evoker tank spec. its not like theyve no had a surprise spec for evoker or had pirate dragons before
[1:17:46] RAF_Sean: Morning legend
[1:18:01] Lausten: By the way if you're gathering souls.. Watch out by gathering souls, if you reach max number of souls you cant do the quest until next week, so spend the souls on buildings so you dont cap souls, learned that the hard way..
[1:18:03] MachoCham: People shit on it as well because it was a massive ramp in difficulty from what came before at launch
[1:18:12] Kimdah_: Cata brought alot of QoL
[1:18:22] MachoCham: Yep
[1:18:40] Kimdah_: Yeah, Heroics were crazy in Cata
[1:18:56] NeeK_23: didnt they remove ammo too?
[1:18:58] TruVillainManny: Cata had the spirit degeneracy for healers.
[1:19:03] fetza108: Heroic Deadmines
[1:19:07] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:19:09] Kimdah_: No more having to pay for spells, flying everywhere, transmog
[1:19:11] RAF_Sean: This is Torghast. Stream should have a trigger warning in the title
[1:19:18] the_pyke: first ever Hardmode 5man
[1:19:19] Kimdah_: And no more ammo for hunters too
[1:19:20] RAF_Sean: *cries in multi tank alts*
[1:19:31] michaelmm: Yes the quest has been repeatable since 9.1.5.
[1:19:52] Kimdah_: AoE loot came in MoP btw
[1:19:52] TruVillainManny: That was one you solo healed heroic bosses because mana bars got so deep at the end of an expansion
[1:19:53] MachoCham: It's not QOL but it's a feature that a lot of people wanted
[1:20:00] RAF_Sean: Sure it is, I am very visually driven so if I don't look good I want to play my character less
[1:20:02] Kimdah_: Now it‚Äôs just normal for us lol
[1:20:10] NeeK_23: @RAF_Sean SL is peak wow content. Nothing unites wow players like hating on wow and SL is the most hated LuL
[1:20:25] Lausten: @michaelmm Yeah, but if you cap souls it becomes non repeatable for some reason
[1:20:30] MachoCham: Firelands
[1:20:44] KaisenSiru: Throne of the Four Winds, Blackwing Descent
[1:20:48] the_pyke: if i could gather Tmog from Classic Cata for Retail i would play it :)
[1:20:48] Kimdah_: The one in Blackrock, oh god, that one will be fun to see
[1:20:51] MachoCham: BwD was great
[1:20:56] TruVillainManny: Firelands, DS, BoT, BWD
[1:21:02] death_cam_: im looking forward to seeing that warlock who won corrupted ashbringer from staysafes stream to tmog his felguards weapon into it xd
[1:21:24] MachoCham: I think it's more the unobtainable vanilla stuff
[1:21:40] MachoCham: I am expecting some form of classic chromie time eventually
[1:21:50] the_pyke: oh shit ... i thought on MoP
[1:21:56] Lausten: I'd be more hyped if you could collect retail stuff from classic from vanilla to wrath..
[1:21:57] the_pyke: cata is just m√§h
[1:22:07] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies üß° https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[1:22:18] MediumRareOG: keep classic and retail separate
[1:22:50] NeeK_23: having to play wrath to get the DK mount in retail wasnt fun imo
[1:23:09] Lausten: @MediumRareOG Agreed, but add removed stuff back to retail like they have done with old scholo, scarlet etc, its such a great fun way to go back and gather stuff imo..
[1:23:18] death_cam_: wonder if they will continue to readd lost / removed items from old dungeons in 10.2.6 such as old sunken temple
[1:23:24] the_pyke: i would love to take a portal in valdrakken and play in wotlk classicwith my char
[1:23:44] Kimdah_: I just remembered that they also finally added a vendor that sells the Silvermoon tabard to Silvermoon in Cata instead of it being locked behind Argent Tourney stuff
[1:24:27] fetza108: I say inwont play cata but maybe i will. Who knows
[1:24:36] TVNems: Have you seen the dreadlord set is now available

[1:24:59] Lausten: @death_cam_ We can only hope.. ü§û
[1:25:02] NeeK_23: the answer is lots
[1:25:06] WochiTV: YES there are soooooo many people still thinking that
[1:25:13] MachoCham: "Are only killing Al'ar"
[1:25:26] the_pyke: get back than never thought about it :D who drops it?
[1:25:38] Kimdah_: Ashes of Al‚Äôar
[1:25:50] MachoCham: Look in your mount journal
[1:25:51] MachoCham: Kappa
[1:25:55] NeeK_23: same with Mimi's head, how many arent doing hardmode
[1:26:06] death_cam_: it will drop on your next run 100% Kappa
[1:26:10] WochiTV: nope
[1:26:13] WochiTV: hard mode only
[1:26:27] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:26:30] NeeK_23: dropped in a TW chest for me LuL
[1:26:30] Kimdah_: I got it a few years ago after a 3 month break.. First run.. Boom, it dropped. I literally screamed
[1:26:33] TruVillainManny: I am not going to lie, I did that a number of times and other similar ones as well.
[1:26:37] Lausten: Hahah, reminds me of a certain streamer who did that, and did the same with Mimiron instead of Yogg, and same with the Scorpion from SoO.. LUL
[1:26:42] MachoCham: Same as Dragon Soul etc has different levels
[1:26:46] Kimdah_: Then over the course of a few weeks I also got Fiery Warhorse and Onyxian Drake
[1:26:52] Paranigmayt: It's like invincible... never seen it drop on my raid - friend of mine got it twice in one week
[1:26:55] TruVillainManny: Killing 2nd boss in Necrotic Wake and then heathing out
[1:27:09] Kimdah_: @paranigmayt WHAT???
[1:27:16] handovdoom666: Bliz needs to add TW raids for all the other expansions. that should def happen in TWW.
[1:27:34] Paranigmayt: without TW - blocked him for a few days :D
[1:27:43] WochiTV: should be 18s
[1:27:45] Paranigmayt: @Kimdah_ Yes, on main and twink.
[1:27:50] NeeK_23: endless .........
[1:27:55] TruVillainManny: Twice in one week?!? That's no friend!
[1:28:03] WochiTV: the alpha was endless and i love it
[1:28:06] Kimdah_: @paranigmayt The pain
[1:28:11] Lausten: rofl
[1:28:32] Paranigmayt: Never raid with him again. Stupid dude. Have to go, good day you all! <3
[1:28:43] KaisenSiru: I got Invincible when it was a 100% drop rate on the 7th farm kill. Then when I was doing ICC for the pets when they were added, an alt got it that I still have stored in my bank
[1:28:50] MediumRareOG: crowd please is a giant PITA to get AFAIK
[1:28:50] Kimdah_: I wonder what Blizz meant with early spring. Bc meteorological Spring just started, but Astrological Spring starts the 21st
[1:29:34] NeeK_23: time for your 2nd can
[1:29:42] MachoCham: My sisters friends dog had that and had to have his chest amputated
[1:29:44] Kimdah_: Dan.. How much have you had? ü§£
[1:29:47] Kubwa7: no pain, no gain, amirite? Kappa
[1:30:05] LuiBMHunter: oh dear - shadowlands has made you turn to the hard stuff
[1:30:11] TruVillainManny: I have not experienced post energy drink chest pain. That worries me.
[1:30:17] Kimdah_: I already guzzled two redbulls in the span of half an hour. üëÄ
[1:30:28] NeeK_23: if you cant feel your heart pounding, how do you know its beating?
[1:30:40] Kimdah_: It‚Äôs a gray day today.
[1:30:44] MachoCham: I've yet to experience a business who uses the Astrological definition for a season
[1:30:46] TruVillainManny: Worries me that it's a thing
[1:30:55] Kimdah_: Yesterday was such a nice day, and today started foggy
[1:31:05] Kimdah_: Yesterday I actually sat outside
[1:31:07] MachoCham: Was pretty nice, fresh spring day
[1:31:13] Kimdah_: The sun was pleasant
[1:31:22] CrowMomocle: It was such a treat to have sun yesterday
[1:31:26] wastedxtime93: Here in Ohio it was gorgeous, went from like low 30s one day to almost 70 the next.
[1:31:27] ellenara35: yeah was nice
[1:31:29] handovdoom666: it was like 65 in Minnesota. in march. global warming doesn't exist.
[1:31:31] MachoCham: Where we going?
[1:31:31] Kimdah_: Haven‚Äôt seen that big ball of fire in a while
[1:31:44] Kimdah_: @wastedxtime93 Celsius please üòÇ
[1:32:02] wastedxtime93: @Kimdah_ that isn't real
[1:32:21] WochiTV: tww
[1:32:21] LuiBMHunter: TWW
[1:32:21] MachoCham: Launch baybay
[1:32:45] Lausten: @Kimdah_ Which ever they use for their earnigs I guess they will use..
[1:32:47] Kimdah_: Hahaha
[1:32:50] wastedxtime93: @Kimdah_ Google says -1.1 to 21
[1:32:50] ImperfectDark: damn, i'm going to Florida in Sept
[1:32:54] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[1:32:54] Layliah79: haha!
[1:32:55] NeeK_23: in that case can you buy the ticket so we can know the date?
[1:33:05] CrowMomocle: Very good forethought
[1:33:05] MachoCham: Just pretend to buy the ticket?
[1:33:09] TruVillainManny: Let's go beginning of Nov!
[1:33:09] Kimdah_: You do seem to have that bad luck ü§£
[1:33:13] MachoCham: Launch in June? Pog
[1:33:16] LuiBMHunter: June is Beta!
[1:33:17] Bware2: in other words - expansion in june then
[1:33:23] databob1: relaxation is for chumps
[1:33:48] TruVillainManny: Woot early June super early launch!
[1:33:56] NeeK_23: just take the laptop, Beta by the Pool
[1:34:47] LuiBMHunter: Cyprus strream?
[1:34:48] Kimdah_: Also, can I get a compliment? I finally replaced my stained and ruined cutting boards..
[1:35:05] WochiTV: big grats lol @Kimdah_
[1:35:38] physalis4: @kimdah_ killing it! great job
[1:35:41] Kimdah_: It‚Äôs a thing that you just keep postponing üò≠
[1:35:44] Lausten: @Kimdah_ Wood or plastic?
[1:36:12] databob1: @Kimdah_ what did you get for the new ones?? I like the bamboo ones
[1:36:14] Kimdah_: @lausten The plastic ones, I use the wood ones for bread and veg
[1:36:19] Layliah79: We need a covenant hearthstone (that changes depending on your covenant). just like we have a garrison hearthstone
[1:36:23] Katariatv: do you think we will get a release date on 10.2.6 soon
[1:36:25] NIICKLAS_TV: truee
[1:36:41] ImperfectDark: whoosh
[1:36:53] Kimdah_: @databob1 I have wood ones and obv plastic ones too
[1:37:00] Kimdah_: Never use wood to cut meats on
[1:37:05] Lausten: @Kimdah_ Good good, dont want microplastic in the food..
[1:37:19] databob1: !emote kraken194CanaryPanic1
[1:37:40] Kimdah_: @lausten I don‚Äôt have dull knives that ruin a cutting board, so dw
[1:37:44] databob1: @kim right on better for meats

[1:38:48] Kimdah_: I still live w my parents as I try to get a house, but the market‚Äôs so crazy
[1:38:53] databob1: I only have two really good knives I wanna get a good set with a knife block

[1:39:16] Kimdah_: @databob1 Don‚Äôt get a set, get them separately
[1:39:42] Kimdah_: Sets are most often p low quality, whereas if you buy a knife every time, you build your own beautiful set
[1:39:49] databob1: better quality or better price?
[1:40:01] Kimdah_: Both
[1:40:12] databob1: ah ok
[1:40:20] nash25pl: !emote widepeepoHappy
[1:40:26] Kimdah_: You can buy one beautiful knife for ‚Ç¨20 for example yet it won‚Äôt ruin your whole monthly budget
[1:40:59] Kimdah_: Just buy a knife every month and after a year you have a beautiful set

[1:41:46] KaisenSiru: anniesCozy

[1:42:58] BBMezzy: Very busy weekend but also productive
[1:43:01] wastedxtime93: Ohh, gotta love the Pokemon stuff. I went and dropped some money on some Pokemon stuff at the 151 shop at the mall the other day.
[1:43:36] physalis4: Busy‚Ä¶my daughter, me and the dog are sick.
[1:44:07] wastedxtime93: Yee, just everything Pokemon, plushes, Funkos, nanolego things, cards, etc and then they have a second shop thats everything else anime.
[1:44:27] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:44:29] wastedxtime93: And they sell invididual cards and have one of the 5k Charizards for sale.
[1:44:51] physalis4: lol yup AND the dog
[1:45:14] wastedxtime93: Gonna post one of those nano lego things in the Disc just in case you haven't seen them.
[1:45:41] wastedxtime93: Yeah that's it, my girl got me an Espeon and she did the Magicarp.
[1:45:55] physalis4: Unrelated. She‚Äôs just old and having gastro problems. Daughter has an ear infection and I have a cold
[1:46:22] databob1: they had a lego set for classic lion vultron that I really wanted to get
[1:46:32] KaisenSiru: devoNOTE
[1:47:43] CrowMomocle: Sounds cool
[1:47:54] CrowMomocle: very creative
[1:48:06] databob1: Dynamic ground mounts would be fun
[1:48:31] wastedxtime93: More Hero talents pls, I'm dying to know what Pack Leader is now.
[1:48:41] Ithylz: Family types of mounts iirc
[1:49:01] Yooosh_: Yeah they have a unique mechanic also with each mount in gw2
[1:49:17] Zuldak: the people on twitter seem upset at the names of the talents interfering with RP fantasy
[1:49:20] wastedxtime93: Whaaa, I'm hyped for Ret, the sunspot and mass haste buffs are gonna be so much fun.
[1:49:23] michaelmm: The Hero Talents are mixed - some great some need more work.
[1:49:24] Kyriac: if they dont make major revamps to windwalker i dont think ill be coming back :/
[1:49:32] ghuuny: if you dont care about professions, you should get engineering wormhole for SL content
[1:49:32] NeeK_23: the last group of talents released (apart from Rogue) were positively recieved from what I saw
[1:49:44] Elrathir: it all worked out in the end
[1:49:56] Zuldak: I feel like the hero talents kinda pigeonhole the normal talents because you're forced to talent build in a way to synergize with the heroic ones
[1:50:08] physalis4: You can never make people happy with talents.
[1:50:23] MediumRareOG: i don't understand why people would quit because of their class. level another one. it takes like a day
[1:50:54] SskygamesS: HeyGuys any NA players on chat? i need help for one achievement takes couple seconds
[1:50:59] BBMezzy: I'm unconvinced of hero talents as an evergreen system
[1:51:13] Iwony: Hi Dan and Chat!
[1:51:13] physalis4: Talent trees are inherently flawed anyway bc there will always be an optimal selection that ppl are forced to choose
[1:51:14] FlutterBaby: @SskygamesS i can help
[1:51:15] nash25pl: can you not use a wissle from korthia to get temporary mount for 45s ?
[1:51:18] Layliah79: NA here. what achievement
[1:51:19] death_cam_: i think if ppl really want "class skins" just add in more warlock green fire type questlines (fire dks for example) etc
[1:51:21] FlutterBaby: i'll log in now
[1:51:24] michaelmm: I think the naming scheme they used form the Talents has awakened a latent desire for more class ability customization in a lot of players.
[1:51:36] Kyriac: @MediumRareOG what is hard to understand? i want to play a windwalker and it feels terrible. theres a reason why its one of the most least represented specs
[1:52:01] Ithylz: Some say they could allocate more dev time to current talents, polish them, fix bugs, etc. BEFORE focusing on something new which will make this work even harder. I agree with this statement tbh
[1:52:03] SskygamesS: FlutterBaby - i need to dance with someone in tirargarde sound - check custom groups  or whisper me lamariana zuljin
[1:52:11] nash25pl: can you not use a wissle from korthia to get temporary mount for 45s ?  Û†ÄÄ
[1:52:40] NeeK_23: its only some lore names, tbh its 90% Dark Ranger. no one is caring about the monk or mage names for example
[1:52:44] Yooosh_: tbf i care about gameplay but i like having some gigachad title for my class still.
[1:52:52] MediumRareOG: you need a speed set
[1:53:01] databob1: they should just name the hero talents after the skill they are based on
[1:53:05] nash25pl: The Silver Shardhide Whistle Toy
[1:53:09] BBMezzy: The Silver Shardhide Whistle is the one from Korthia
[1:53:21] wastedxtime93: @Kyriac it's more hard to believe that of all the different classes and specs you can't find at least one other you vibe with but you like what you like I suppose.
[1:53:41] Ithylz: Sure, the general idea is fine IMO. Yet I think some classes deserve current talents rework (monk for instance)
[1:53:48] nash25pl: F
[1:54:12] SskygamesS: FlutterBaby let me know when you are avaivable
[1:54:19] NeeK_23: nothing official
[1:54:24] Ithylz: They want them before so that players can give feedback ASAP if memory serves
[1:54:36] MediumRareOG: my run speed is 2x normal run speed
[1:54:53] nash25pl: care the stun can soft lock you
[1:55:10] MediumRareOG: most of the speed set is buying ilevel 418-424 gear from the AH
[1:56:37] nash25pl: whats the drama ?
[1:56:41] nash25pl: i am confused
[1:56:56] physalis4: LUL you are ruining lives right now
[1:56:56] michaelmm: I've seen a bunch of folks say they thought it dropped from Alar. Also ppl think Mimiron's head drops from Mimiron.
[1:57:01] thomssone: dumbasses realizing they are dumbasses
[1:57:02] Iwony: I never thought that but I guess I always had too many sources / wowhead to find out where something drops :D
[1:57:14] nash25pl: cause reading the raid journal and drop tables is hard
[1:57:19] nash25pl: NODDERS
[1:57:32] Ithylz: These poor souls
[1:57:37] Iwony: I did it when there was no Dungeon Journal ;D
[1:57:42] michaelmm: It's kinda logical that the mount would drop from a boss that looks just like it!
[1:57:44] BBMezzy: That death counter you have there is interesting
[1:58:05] ctang0: You shouldn't die so many times man,
[1:58:09] Yooosh_: when was dungeon journal added to wow?
[1:58:34] NeeK_23: correct
[1:58:36] ctang0: #ad
[1:58:38] nash25pl: i feel old
[1:58:46] NeeK_23: I actually googled it this weekend
[1:58:47] Valestrus: i did the same for 3 resets... then realized via the dungeon journal... got it after 12 tries :D
[1:58:59] ctang0: Yes.
[1:59:07] Lausten: Use it as an intro and then make a new one

[1:59:57] ctang0: @AlfredK real
[2:00:00] nash25pl: what you mean 12 years ago  cata classic is not out yet Kappa
[2:00:56] Lausten: That also aged me way too much.. Turning 35 next week.. NotLikeThis

[2:01:50] Layliah79: young at heart still <3
[2:01:52] Iwony: 47 here :O
[2:02:02] MediumRareOG: reminder: you need to buy the ravenous anima cell LUL

[2:02:10] Yooosh_: i'm 25
[2:02:12] alicemch: started when i was 29
[2:02:22] ArthurD25: Im 21
[2:02:23] Layliah79: kids of parents who've played wow
[2:02:26] pvalue01: my niece is 12 and plays!
[2:02:26] elysssi: im 21
[2:02:27] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:02:29] physalis4: Twitter poll it
[2:02:35] databob1: The people that are worried about Hero talents are right. the meta is going to dictate what most people take preventing some people from using the class lore they want to. character lore should be cosmetic like the green fire or the fire cat not part of power progression.
[2:02:40] TruVillainManny: Torghast has existed longer than MrGM has been a dad.
[2:02:42] the_pyke: 16yo ... now 20 y later :D
[2:02:46] havoom01: haha
[2:02:48] brian_777777777: my parents
[2:02:50] Hexshurik: heya mate,I have ran thorgast for a week and got a lot of shoulders transmog, but I didn't get any weapon. any clue why?
[2:02:53] Layliah79: we have a 22 year old in the guild who's mom got her playing KEKW
[2:02:58] LuiBMHunter: grandparents?
[2:02:59] ArthurD25: My uncle showed it to me the first time it went free to play until lvl 20
[2:03:00] physalis4: My grandparents
[2:03:26] Layliah79: Wow makes us continue to feel young since we were when we started playing.
[2:03:30] nash25pl: played on classic and cata when i was a kid stopped at cata  came back end of BFA
[2:03:32] virro0: Would be nice if this genre appealed to a zoomer generation. Imagine the innovation in the MMO space instead of the 3 largest senior citizen MMOs fighting it out FeelsBadMan
[2:03:40] TruVillainManny: My cohost got into WoW because of her parents. I am reminded to plan for retirement so very often...
[2:03:49] Zuldak: weapons being usable but on different loot tables is the bane of collectors. Agi rogue only daggers are awful
[2:03:50] Hexshurik: oh I see, thank you.
[2:03:55] Lausten: @Hexshurik Shoulder mogs are for every class as they are cosmetics, but the weapons still kinda have that class restriction to them, so bring a class that can use the mog you're after
[2:04:12] nash25pl: only came back to game case a) finished my degree b) other mmorpg i played killed off my account for thinking minecraft is a bot and ban me for life lul
[2:04:37] wastedxtime93: My age really hit me when I saw a girl I went to HS with make a post congratulating her daughter for her sweet 16. We're only 30 and have been out of school for 13 years...
[2:05:01] Hexshurik: @lausten got it, thanks mate  =)
[2:05:07] Zuldak: the hardest one to find for the ravenous were the sea cursed prisoners iirc
[2:05:09] physalis4: You can accidentally F yourself out of xmog if you turn the broker into an orb
[2:05:12] wastedxtime93: Keep in mind this is America
[2:05:31] paladinfaraam: Woah Torghast
[2:05:40] virro0: Why not just press the "reset" button on Era and letts go back to the good times again. Just let me give up my adult life and let me play brown class again in Vanilla FeelsGoodMan
[2:05:44] paladinfaraam: Just tuned in, been a minute since Ive seen this
[2:06:03] Zuldak: im in the extreme minority but i... liked torghast and island expeditions in SL >.>
[2:06:07] TruVillainManny: That blade might have sliced off your back pockets.
[2:06:11] virro0: DO IT AGAIN!
[2:06:27] NeeK_23: there's more classic modes than retail modes
[2:06:30] wastedxtime93: This man is a true villian, wants like 10 different WoWs D:
[2:06:46] havoom01: im farming razorfen kraul, i need rich purple silk shirt recipe 0,03% drop chance
[2:06:54] virro0: I dont want SoD, or wrath or Cata. I want F R E S H FeelsGoodMan
[2:07:00] Ithylz: I'm SO glad I did everything Shadowlands-related during the expansion itself so I don't have to go back
[2:07:06] nash25pl: only came back to game case a) finished my degree b) other mmorpg i played killed off my account for thinking minecraft is a bot and ban me for life KEKWAIT
[2:07:09] virro0: Me and the boys
[2:07:37] Zuldak: omg for 10.2.6 what if we could get the captain hooktail mount? The infinite pirate dragon from taxavesh
[2:07:38] Iwony: I just want warbands and Alpha to start for War within
[2:07:44] physalis4: What does fresh entail? Just a server that hasn‚Äôt had its economy ruined yet?
[2:07:49] NeeK_23: I logged onto classic era, all servers were low pop and the starting zones are dead. saw 1 other person in Elswyn
[2:08:45] virro0: Any news on making the game less bloated in next expansion? Or are we just moving on and getting deeper into the convoluted Raiding and m+ for example FeelsBadMan ?
[2:08:51] virro0: Seems like thats what people are talking about these days
[2:08:57] Ithylz: @Zuldak I hope there'll be actual new mounts, not recolours
[2:09:21] Zuldak: hey MRGM question. We know with TWW that gold will be cross realm sharable with alts. Do we know if the AH in regards to weapons and armor will be region wide?
[2:09:39] wastedxtime93: Better the way it is than the Destiny approach and vaulting content people paid for just for the sake of space.
[2:10:10] Zuldak: you cant send gold through mail tho :/
[2:10:22] michaelmm: They mentioned there would be a warband bank. I'd assume that could be used to move gold to any character.
[2:10:25] virro0: I just kinda miss the days where maybe an NPC was about to cast a spell on your healer and you would see the rogue gouge the mob. Now its all just a big blur of weak auras and air horns blaring. It just seems a little much these days
[2:10:29] havoom01: well i cannot send gold from ravencrest to tarren mill,i need somebody to help me with
[2:11:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:11:11] Lausten: @Zuldak Would be nice to not being in need of a second account for proper deals on mogs, like TM is the worst to buy mogs on, always someone think that just cause its TM things are worth 10 times region sale average..
[2:11:13] NeeK_23: @virro0 thats all optional though
[2:11:13] Zuldak: yeah mog collecting would be great. lot of mid or small server sellers cant find buyers
[2:11:30] KashminkEEC: KashminkEEC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 35 months. THIS is commitment chat. We could've had almost 4 babies by now.
[2:11:33] Hexshurik: this past weekend we had cross region pvp tournament. do you think one day will have a NA and EU regions merged as one?
[2:11:47] virro0: Its not reeeaaally optional if you want to be just kinda serious about endgame though
[2:11:49] MediumRareOG: i just installed my first weak aura, to tell me to use barbed shot
[2:11:56] michaelmm: Weakaura's and the like are only really required for Mythic raid end bosses.
[2:12:22] michaelmm: The high end players don't use airhorns. Most use BigWigs instead of DBM which is a lot less noisy.
[2:12:25] Zuldak: i have a WA that shows me my health, shields and what abilities i have available
[2:12:32] virro0: I dunno maybe im just cringe. I just want to see things on my screen again :(
[2:12:40] MediumRareOG: 10.2 BM is all about barbed shot
[2:12:40] virro0: Now i just see numbers. LIke the matrix
[2:12:45] Zuldak: EU/NA i think have deep technical issues that prevent that
[2:12:46] NeeK_23: if you dont enjoy retail, theres several other wow modes to play. if you dont like any of those, then maybe wow isnt for you wanymore
[2:12:47] virro0: Game is behind there somewhere
[2:13:16] Lausten: @Hexshurik Tournament wise, who should have the disadvantage of having 150ms vs below 30ms for the other team?
[2:13:24] virro0: I wanna play fresh woyer :(
[2:13:32] mikael_jansson90: @virro0 u my guy are in a minority and thank good.
[2:13:42] Erielle04: @Zuldak Same reason why reset days will never be combined
[2:13:57] virro0: @mikael_jansson90 r/WoW enjoyer?
[2:14:04] Hexshurik: me too, I am Brazilian, nut in live in UK for about 16 years now, all my friends play on NA while I play on EU, that sucks =/
[2:14:08] michaelmm: Some of the players blamed ping times on the results.
[2:14:08] wastedxtime93: The Lock 2 v 3 comeback?
[2:14:12] LuiBMHunter: you don't watch mdi? or tgp?
[2:14:14] pvalue01: liquid beat echo in a 2v3 to win the match
[2:14:17] NeeK_23: i think a team was down 3v2 and came back
[2:14:31] dright424: a 2v3 comeback in the elimination round of the best of 5
[2:14:39] databob1: my arthritis is  kicking my ass today
[2:14:42] Ithylz: If someone can't see anything because of WAs, they're using too many of them, especially since DF where things are pretty well telegraphed
[2:14:50] Hexshurik: you should, that was an amazing match
[2:14:52] LuiBMHunter: mdi is awesome for the strats teams come out with
[2:14:56] MediumRareOG: i would rather eat my own face than watch MDI ngl
[2:15:05] pvalue01: you should watch the vid on the official Warcraft youtube showing the insane strat Echo did in Dawn of the infinites
[2:15:08] michaelmm: Some players blamed ping times for their results and then rowed back on that when it was pointed out that was unsporting behaviour.
[2:15:08] NeeK_23: if you dont do M+, MDI can be confusing since you arent aware of what exactly youre seeing
[2:15:47] Hexshurik: pvp is a completely different game =)
[2:15:49] Lausten: Yeah I can never follow whats going on, feel like its gotta be pre recorded and then ocmmentary added after LUL
[2:16:07] LuiBMHunter: but but I'm certainly I only lose when I pvp because of lag *honest*
[2:16:18] Layliah79: Clap
[2:16:25] Hexshurik: gz
[2:17:21] BBMezzy: With the invasion this is the perfect moment to grind out all the souls you need
[2:17:23] Hexshurik: thanks for the stream, mate. got to go back to work =D
[2:18:16] virro0: Bruh is Faction/Realm change really 55 Euros? Blizz are hardcore with their prices ngl
[2:18:17] NeeK_23: until you realise you need more souls for the other covenants...
[2:18:55] MediumRareOG: blizzard needs to fix dungeon queueing while levelling. it's a really sucky system
[2:18:56] Lausten: @NeeK_23 I was about to say that, but decided I wouldnt be the one to put some salt into his already bleeding wound of playing SL Kappa

[2:19:02] Iwony: The problem is the amount of anima you need now not the souls ^^

[2:19:25] Iwony: :D
[2:19:58] Lausten: It was meant to last an entire expansion, not be grinded out in a day, but yeah need an easier way of grinding anima
[2:20:28] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:20:39] Iwony: you need a certain point count to advance to the next level
[2:20:53] NeeK_23: why do you think Sylvanas is still in the Maw? Anima farm takes time
[2:20:55] fooxytv: do you have the hand mount from shadowlands?
[2:21:10] Lausten: Check wowhead comment for which mobs gives which skills
[2:21:19] MediumRareOG: re: ravenous cells. some of the mobs only spawn in particular wings, just FYI
[2:21:26] Lausten: That is how it works yeah
[2:21:27] NeeK_23: yeah its not random
[2:21:57] Iwony: also don't forget to use the currency to get your advances on this cube thingy
[2:22:05] NeeK_23: some mobs only appear on certain wings too
[2:22:08] Lausten: There was also some Torghast Achievement addon back in SL that I used for it
[2:22:08] Iwony: like auto loot phantasma
[2:22:13] Lausten: Maybe that still works
[2:22:27] Iwony: ah I c
[2:23:08] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming to the Trading Post in March 2024 | World of Warcraft - https://youtu.be/P5ptnvI6-t0
[2:23:41] Lausten: Torghast Tourguide gives tooltip for which mobs gives which ravenous anima cells
[2:24:53] MediumRareOG: the loot is complete RNG
[2:24:53] death_cam_: farm highest diff for higher drops
[2:24:58] death_cam_: and always check vendors
[2:25:00] Lausten: I did it over and over fully
[2:25:04] Iwony: you need best points to get the vault... some transmog only dropps there
[2:25:17] Lausten: I sometimes bought 2-3 shoulders in one run
[2:25:29] MediumRareOG: iirc you need to get to floor 6 (adamant vaults) to get a chance at some of the loot
[2:25:30] Iwony: Still missing stuff from there -_-
[2:25:51] Iwony: ands missing the 200k anima achive
[2:26:28] BBMezzy: The 200k anima achievement can be done fairly easily with the correct torghast affix
[2:26:47] metavfx: hello @MrGM why are you runing Thorgast ? :) for achievement ?
[2:26:54] Lausten: Theres also a leggo power for phantasma I learned last stream
[2:26:58] Iwony: I think my shaman still needs 80 k or so but I cannot be bothered atm ^^
[2:27:00] metavfx: ok nice ! :)
[2:27:07] BBMezzy: There's the one that turns some of your phantasma into a slime, that you can then kill to reloot. Over and over. Add the phantasma increase powers to it and it's just a matter of time
[2:27:43] funviking99: do we know anything about the hearthstone event?
[2:27:52] Lausten: Yeah it steals a percentage of your phantasma and gives it back at larger quantity, so it stacks pretty quickly with that mob
[2:27:58] funviking99: hmm
[2:28:09] Iwony: you think it will be same time as the Pirate thingy
[2:28:10] Iwony: ?
[2:28:29] Iwony: MArch they said sigh
[2:28:44] funviking99: true
[2:29:27] Lausten: I bet the Pirate event will come 19th and 20th which is the start of spring on the northern hemosphere
[2:30:01] Rugmanimus: Do we have a new Veilstrider achievement yet?
[2:30:02] death_cam_: HS is shown before the patch on the roadmap so
[2:30:05] Iwony: there is also Noble Garden soon ish
[2:30:22] funviking99: they really don‚Äôt want anything datamined from now on
[2:30:34] MediumRareOG: nobelgarden has a new mount?
[2:30:47] Layliah79: could be there but named something else
[2:31:04] bomayaa: maybe they've fogotten to put them in
[2:31:05] Layliah79: i like more hidden stuff
[2:31:21] funviking99: so when would season 4 start ?
[2:31:21] databob1: northrend cup is next month too
[2:31:31] Layliah79: oh wow!! YAY
[2:31:44] Layliah79: wonder what the new rewards will be - a 3rd recolor of the set?
[2:31:54] Duffman1001: season 4 news or 10.2.6?
[2:31:58] death_cam_: oh yeah its monday news day:D
[2:32:12] Layliah79: except that one week they didn't anything FeelsWeirdMan
[2:32:18] death_cam_: patch reveal date announcement i hope
[2:32:22] serious2: It is a mystery how Blizzard works. Like the mystery of the hunter who got suspended for having a pet with a default name (Carrion Bird)
[2:32:26] mrsrockguru: season 4 starts after 10.2.6, will be getting a ptr for season 4 after the start of 10.2.6

[2:33:00] Duffman1001: Aw man I dont miss grinding this place lmao
[2:33:12] wastedxtime93: Casimir Pulaski Day
[2:33:22] Lausten: @Getcha_Pulll That was only relevant for the old creeps at Blizzard.. Kappa
[2:33:54] databob1: spring break varies from school to school
[2:33:58] neverbornlucky: today is national be a   karen  day
[2:34:07] Getcha_Pulll: @Lausten true KEKW
[2:34:38] neverbornlucky: still alive they haven't taken me yet
[2:34:39] databob1: I demand to see the manager
[2:35:03] LuiBMHunter: fairly sure your partner is the manager ...
[2:35:06] atroyabelladonna: depends on region, kids had a week break mid-March (mid-winter break) here and will get spring break in April
[2:35:27] neverbornlucky: MrGm the newest outrage in America is they are mad at Peppa Pig
[2:35:32] serious2: Did you loot the boss?
[2:35:54] Lausten: @neverbornlucky Not John Dillermand anymore? LUL

[2:37:02] chelfx: i just googled John Dillermand and its something
[2:37:06] serious2: @Lausten John who?
[2:37:08] emarol_dk: ofc he has not, he is not Danish :D
[2:37:19] chelfx: "John Dillermand is a Danish stop motion animated children's television series about a man and his very long penis"
[2:37:24] Lausten: DR the Danish equivilant of BBC is, imagine them being on drugs when they made a kids show..
[2:37:32] Iwony: it is better for mental health not to
[2:37:46] neverbornlucky: only reason I know this is because my mom said it came up on her google about peppa pig lol
[2:37:49] emarol_dk: And that is true, and very weird
[2:37:51] mrsrockguru: Give me Mr Ben any day to that
[2:38:06] Elrathir: wanna guess what diller means in Danish?
[2:38:12] JzeaDecimate: Size matters
[2:38:22] MachoCham: I'm back - Peppa Pig is a cunt

[2:43:29] atroyabelladonna: I too am an altoholic
[2:43:39] Lausten: @MediumRareOG Okay, you do have a problem. LUL

[2:45:41] mikalelele13: ain‚Äôt got time for alts
[2:45:50] Layliah79: wait, you play retail?! KEKW
[2:46:30] chelfx: than i haven't played the game since 2007
[2:46:35] Layliah79: they prob don't even do achievements and collections... so who's really playing the game.
[2:46:56] Slins2195: how many mount you have ?
[2:46:56] MediumRareOG: "I have a few alts for holiday events." gets translated like the game Telephone a bunch of times and comes out as "I want to blow up school children with land mines"
[2:47:08] atroyabelladonna: If you find a character you love, that's amazing!  I just like different things at different times for certain groups.  My mage can get everyone places. I dig that.
[2:47:18] neverbornlucky: btw MrGm I did a search on youtube first thing came up is American parents mad at Peppa Pig that  it makes your child bratty lol
[2:47:19] metavfx: I just change pc what is your addon for achievement ? I completely forget @MrGM
[2:47:38] MediumRareOG: (in the minds of random twitter users i mean)
[2:48:07] MachoCham: Yes
[2:48:08] Layliah79: he's using Zygor to help with achievements.
[2:48:10] Rugmanimus: All The Things
[2:48:10] MachoCham: They're on the map still
[2:48:18] metavfx: thx
[2:48:24] chelfx: You should do a video or have a tweet with the list of addons you use for collections
[2:48:25] MachoCham: Down south mainly
[2:48:52] MachoCham: Yes, we can then have a command
[2:48:55] mikalelele13: I‚Äôm almost at 26k ach points!
[2:48:58] mikalelele13: Lol
[2:49:14] Layliah79: 38,970
[2:49:18] Rugmanimus: over 43k here
[2:49:25] michaelmm: I'd list it - I like seeing what other folks use - have found a few good addons that way.
[2:49:32] dright424: addon spotlights might make good youtube shorts
[2:49:36] MediumRareOG: we will make pet battler out of you yet, Dan
[2:49:39] MachoCham: Pet Battles and M+
[2:49:40] MachoCham: Same thing
[2:49:41] neverbornlucky: touchpad is also fueled by the power of can cream corn

[2:49:52] death_cam_: 43890 here
[2:50:24] Layliah79: i'm missing A LOT of PVP achievements
[2:50:26] BBMezzy: Makes sense
[2:50:29] alicemch: KEKW
[2:50:35] Ithylz: You should make an effort tbh Madge
[2:50:40] MediumRareOG: There is a learning curve with pet battles. Definitely watch some videos offline to get set up with the right addons and to know how they work
[2:50:43] thomssone: maybe start playing the game then? ;)
[2:50:45] Elrathir: you should think about playing the game sometime
[2:50:53] atroyabelladonna: Maximum Effort
[2:51:20] michaelmm: Just create another 47 alts and you will be a proper wow player!
[2:51:22] neverbornlucky: We try to distract Taliesin to make sure he doesn't play the game on stream
[2:51:25] MediumRareOG: rematch and pet battle scripts,, primarily, yes
[2:52:06] mikalelele13: I just got into the pet battle thing, actually enjoy it bit diff content than doing the usual stuff
[2:52:19] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: Do you think we will get an extra character slot in WoW since we‚Äôre getting the Earthen allied race?
[2:52:25] MediumRareOG: doing political commentary either means turning into a trump fanatic OR getting constantly death threats and doxing. there is no in between
[2:52:29] MachoCham: Doubtful, as it's not a class
[2:52:33] RosieSeren: I love Tali, but sometimes I feel streams get spoiled by peoplle purposefully winding him up
[2:52:34] mikalelele13: but I‚Äôve got fk all achieves done lol
[2:52:43] MachoCham: Also you can have 50 chars on a realm now right?
[2:53:01] mikalelele13: what‚Äôs the max ach points now you can get 40 something thousand?
[2:53:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin  loves drama basically
[2:53:15] Gapplebees1: do you mythic raid?
[2:53:26] MachoCham: It's better to admit that than just blindly parrot
[2:53:52] MediumRareOG: @MachoCham No limit per realm. 60 per account
[2:54:06] databob1: Taliesin isn't as knowledgeable about alot of the hills he chooses to die on as he thinks
[2:54:17] Lausten: @MachoCham 50, and 60 account, theres a weird "bug" where they didnt increase the number to 60 for servers, It may have been fixed.. But I know people were able to transfer on to the realm but not create new ones
[2:54:18] MachoCham: See: Wow reset
[2:54:34] neverbornlucky: Taliesin is apparently over Asmongold now lol
[2:54:35] MachoCham: Wow 2
[2:54:50] fooxytv: WoW 2 pisses me off lol
[2:54:55] Bware2: wow is dead - buzzword since TBC
[2:54:57] Lausten: We are on wow engine 10, soon 11.. LUL

[2:55:18] Elrathir: the war within is dead btw
[2:55:31] MediumRareOG: i gave up doing DF achivements while the expansion was current in 10.0.5
[2:56:07] neverbornlucky: MrGm do you fear that blizzard will bring the diablo4 65 dollar horse currency to a wow store model with tendies trading shop currency and a mount bundle ?
[2:56:30] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:57:14] MachoCham: Anyone who is losing sleep about that, can we swap lives for a hot minute?
[2:57:14] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: I kinda wish we had the option to enjoy dungeons and raids without the need of a very high ilevel gearscore. Otherwise, it‚Äôs difficult to join pugs in general when you‚Äôre trying to do what everyone else is doing.
[2:57:16] neverbornlucky: MrGm it was the plat coins their store currency
[2:57:36] MediumRareOG: @Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast one word: timewalking
[2:57:45] physalis4: There should be follower raids so ppl can experience the full story
[2:58:11] CpnRad: 100% on follower raids, 10 man and make the loot cosmetic
[2:58:18] RosieSeren: I feel that's what LFR is for tbh
[2:58:20] MachoCham: It becomes a single player game at that point
[2:58:26] Lausten: @Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast Make your own groups, its only natural that people who want to suceed want to bring the best players, same goes for any sport out there, and video games these days are played like sports..
[2:58:38] CpnRad: @RosieSeren LFR is limited by its wings though
[2:58:43] dright424: no loot, no problem with follower raids
[2:58:44] MediumRareOG: If you want to raid with 19 bots, do LFR
[2:59:03] MachoCham: The whole Gearscore thing can be negated by stuff like the Dojo where the ethos is different
[2:59:04] MachoCham: !dojo
[2:59:04] Brandishblade: should just have Norm/Heroic with Normal having the que/group finder. too many difficulties spreading ppl out

[2:59:10] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: People are trying to get head of the curve achievement and unlock rare mounts. Kinda hard to do that when you get kicked for having a low ilevel gearscore
[2:59:12] MediumRareOG: nobody is doing raids for the fun of it
[2:59:28] neverbornlucky: follow raids would be great for old wow stuff and quest to do transmog and  achviements
[2:59:40] MachoCham: @MediumRareOG Well that's a sweeping statement
[2:59:46] databob1: his currated chromie time idea. it was one of his better concepts
[3:00:12] Ithylz: @MediumRareOG What?
[3:00:14] HuntingElk: Good Morning, Hows it going?
[3:00:15] Jack_the_Dipper: Sure it is, look at the Twitch WoW streamers and the data @MrGM
[3:00:20] Jack_the_Dipper: Just look at the data
[3:00:34] neverbornlucky: followers are smarter then human players sometime long live AI
[3:00:36] GarbageM4n: Dan hope you are good man, I cannot WAIT for the hidden March patch
[3:00:52] CpnRad: terrible WoW takes will cheer anyone up
[3:00:56] HuntingElk: doing well....glad you're doing better
[3:00:57] MediumRareOG: easy test: if there was no loot, nobody would do raids
[3:00:59] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[3:01:13] Jack_the_Dipper: No they dont
[3:01:23] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: So far I‚Äôm 25 mounts away from having 250 mounts achievement.
[3:01:23] Jack_the_Dipper: They dont count only the reall hard players
[3:01:27] Brandishblade: I want my warband to be my dungeon followers. make it happen

[3:46:53] Sparklefartz: theres too many hero talents for them to balance before WW release of even within the first patch
[3:46:55] Sparklefartz: imo
[3:47:18] mrsrockguru: Yeah anytime between the 11th - 18th march for the moun

[3:47:28] Shrandamar: they are evergreen so they will be balanced eventually :P
[3:47:41] CianoHD3: 1 ability but some affect different talents aswell
[3:47:42] Lausten: Yeah thats what I meant, the passive notes are pointless
[3:48:06] CianoHD3: its to emulate the WOD talent updates
[3:48:33] CianoHD3: it was at the announcement that just shows the choice nodes
[3:48:40] Lausten: Like who cares if I get a talent to give me 3 more rage from swipe or what ever, just give me 3 more rage build into swipe, no need to make it come from a talent, its so bullshit waste of dev time
[3:48:56] Sparklefartz: ^^^^
[3:48:59] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:49:31] Sparklefartz: the devs dont play the game so therefore they cant understand the changes they make, theres 0 PvP balance in DF and the PvP spell balance is always 5-10% instead of 1-2-3% like they used to do
[3:49:50] Lausten: And on top of that, imagine if it bugs, no one can figure out whre the bug is coming from cause the math now got x y z variables on top of all already existing ones, its a way to complicate the math behind the scene unnessesary
[3:49:52] Jack_the_Dipper: For me they can lower the amount of abilities for some classes. My main is ret pala and I have 26 abilities that I need to use in M+. Or mages have also a lot
[3:49:57] funviking99: class skins would have been cooler
[3:50:06] Layliah79: i bet the mount comes back again in the trading post for tenders.
[3:50:30] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:50:54] Jack_the_Dipper: I dont know the devs, but they dont play the game
[3:51:05] Jack_the_Dipper: Kappa
[3:51:10] Jack_the_Dipper: of course they do
[3:51:24] atroyabelladonna: Devs do play the game
[3:51:42] CianoHD3: i know Ion does because every time his guild gets stuck in raid they nerf the raid Kappa
[3:51:46] Ithylz: Only casually
[3:51:52] chelfx: Doesnt Holly play a lot and she is very casual player and John Heights is mythic raider
[3:52:09] HuntingElk: there's no way for them to make acceptable repairs
[3:52:14] Jack_the_Dipper: How do everyone know these devs? What are their names?
[3:52:17] Lausten: The devs play the game, and they also play loads of other games in the genre, that is clear from interviews by how they talk about the game
[3:52:26] Elrathir: influential content creators like yourself definitely don't play the game with their one char Kappa
[3:52:53] atroyabelladonna: Don't you want people who do every kind of content?  Not everyone raids, or plays casually.  I would want input from devs who play all kinds of content.
[3:53:08] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming to the Trading Post in March 2024 | World of Warcraft - https://youtu.be/P5ptnvI6-t0
[3:53:16] Jack_the_Dipper: I thin we need to look at some other Twitch streamers.... but not the big ones and get the data
[3:53:22] chelfx: @Lausten and lot times playing other games can help wow, so they can steal ideas from them lol
[3:53:26] CianoHD3: Ion used to upload guides in TBC
[3:53:31] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[3:53:41] CianoHD3: he released a Zul Aman bear run guide
[3:53:51] death_cam_: i miss the dev Q&A streams with ion
[3:53:53] chelfx: he was the one who figured out Cthun was impossilbe wasnt it
[3:54:05] Jack_the_Dipper: me2
[3:54:12] CianoHD3: @chelfx yeah he did the math
[3:54:23] RosieSeren: yeah most people who work at blizzard are big fans of the game, isn't it well known that their underpay massively
[3:54:31] Lausten: @chelfx Of course, why invent the wheel over again? Imagine tech companies didnt get inspired by other companies, damn tech development would be slow LUL
[3:54:34] BBMezzy: I miss just communication from the dev team in general
[3:54:35] bojackhorseman2004: Ion made some kick ass raids
[3:55:01] Adrenaline_Gaming_Beast: We need a poll. Do you guys/gals think Blizzard devs act like they‚Äôre slightly out of touch with the player base when things don‚Äôt go well in WoW?
[3:55:02] bojackhorseman2004: maybe they dont have anything to communicate?
[3:55:10] Shrandamar: it's because one of the wowhead people complained about the teasing lol
[3:55:15] CpnRad: maybe they realised people got too hyped for a .6 and reigned it back a bit
[3:55:22] lyreilla: Alright, I'm going to hop off of here, I hope you guys have a great rest of the day :)
[3:55:25] BBMezzy: I'd hardly call posting pirate emoticons communicating either :p
[3:55:28] chelfx: i think when alpha get annouced we will getl oads of intervirwes
[3:55:30] bojackhorseman2004: yes but what do the retail dev communicate if they are not releasing anything new?
[3:55:34] Jack_the_Dipper: End of MArch Alpha release
[3:55:41] Lausten: I feel like the Pirate Flag memes and the layoffs and merger into Microsoft sure put a stopper for the communication, from the outside it seems like they got toild to quiet it down from upstairs
[3:55:52] bojackhorseman2004: "hey community, coffee machin at the office broke, hope everyone is enjoying S3"
[3:55:54] Ithylz: They'll prob communicate more once 10.2.7 is out
[3:56:13] Sparklefartz: @Ithylz doubtful
[3:56:42] atroyabelladonna: Maybe they just don't want to accidentally drop any content secrets.
[3:56:45] BBMezzy: Remember Dev Watercoolers in the MoP & WoD era? I miss them
[3:56:46] bojackhorseman2004: Like, i feel like blizzard gets allot of unfair critisism. its just a downtime in the wow patch cycles. Which is fine
[3:56:51] bojackhorseman2004: dosnt mean the devs are doing somthing wrong
[3:57:06] MajorFrog225: do you think getting to play 3 days early will be necessary to remain competitive?  regarding the epic edition for tww
[3:57:06] Ithylz: What I mean is that they usually talk about what's coming next but since 10.2.6 is mostly secret well... nothing to say
[3:57:10] bojackhorseman2004: Exactly
[3:57:22] bojackhorseman2004: and they released the hero talents early! and! made changes to them based on feedback
[3:57:33] Jack_the_Dipper: End of March Alpha gets released and If im right you make me mod and let me time out Manthieus for 10 minutes Kappa
[3:57:34] bojackhorseman2004: so how are they not communicating? xD
[3:57:45] Jack_the_Dipper: Afther that you can unmod me
[3:57:49] the_rethan_family: Since learning about the next WoW-book, I've become really interested in Arator the Redeemer. In Midnight, he will represent a group of Elves who have no connection to Quel'Thalas. He will be a true foreigner to his mother's people.
[3:58:10] Sparklefartz: i dont expect much to change for WoW in the future tbh
[3:58:27] CianoHD3: for EU its actually longer for leveling then NA because of the reset we get an extra day
[3:58:31] alextheblight: yes
[3:58:36] the_rethan_family: yes
[3:58:38] Lausten: Hes the son of light and shadow ;)
[3:58:39] Jack_the_Dipper: @the_rethan_family You have the book?
[3:58:45] Sparklefartz: i dont foresee the devs just gaining and understanding of the changes they make out of nowhere
[3:58:48] bomayaa: the child of light and dark
[3:58:49] alextheblight: half-elf, yes
[3:58:50] Sparklefartz: an*
[3:58:55] Iwony: Still will not buy the legendary edition, I see no advantage to pay 20 euros for early access to an expansion...
[3:58:55] Jack_the_Dipper: IS the new book good?
[3:59:04] CianoHD3: he is also in the paladin Class Hall and a follower in it
[3:59:08] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[3:59:21] alextheblight: yup
[3:59:22] bojackhorseman2004: wow book being good just makes everyone who want stuff in the game more resentfull :(
[3:59:33] alextheblight: was also a paladin companion
[3:59:45] CpnRad: there's some great ones
[3:59:47] CianoHD3: i think there is a stay awhile and listen in Argus
[3:59:49] the_rethan_family: He was born in Stormwind and then spent some time with his Aunt Vereesa in Dalaran (which meant he was displaced again once Arthas happened).
[3:59:54] bojackhorseman2004: hey, how did garrosh go back in time? "read the book"
[4:00:03] Jack_the_Dipper: I have the Ashbringer and the first Chronical and yes I think they are good and very interesting
[4:00:14] CpnRad: dragons
[4:00:15] bojackhorseman2004: the bronze dragon dude freed him
[4:00:18] bojackhorseman2004: there wasa trial
[4:00:19] ratgefingah: read the book
[4:00:21] Iwony: with the brnze dragon
[4:00:21] bojackhorseman2004: you need to read the book
[4:00:29] Sparklefartz: @bojackhorseman2004 people dont care about the store, they want good game balance so they can play what class they want
[4:00:30] Lausten: I've long been thinking about reading the books, but that requires buying the books, but damn im not made of money..
[4:00:30] CianoHD3: Bronze Dragonflight
[4:00:30] HuntingElk: Cromie
[4:00:31] Iwony: the one from timeless isle
[4:00:35] atroyabelladonna: haha
[4:00:35] bojackhorseman2004: its so stupid xD
[4:00:37] chelfx: i think it depends on the book and what they tell in it, like Syvnaus book should have been in wow, or like Before the storm i think was fine in a book
[4:00:41] Sparklefartz: bronze dragonflight
[4:00:56] alextheblight: the whole timetravel thing was a mess
[4:00:57] Sparklefartz: yea its part of the WoD story, you find the agent of the BD dead
[4:00:59] CianoHD3: its a quest in Nagrand
[4:01:00] the_rethan_family: The bronze dragon from the timeless isle used the hourglass we players collected sand for. Once Garrosh was freed, he strangled his liberator.
[4:01:05] bojackhorseman2004: like make a 30 sec ingame cutscene about hes trial, him being freed and sent to wod
[4:01:06] bojackhorseman2004: thats it
[4:01:15] notjackblackk: platinumwow has a good video about wrathion that explains it all
[4:01:21] Sparklefartz: they tell alot of major plot points in books
[4:01:42] chelfx: that is in stormwind isnt it
[4:01:47] alextheblight: he strangled him in-game. In the short story he stabbed Kairoz in the neck with the glass shard from the hourglass
[4:01:51] CianoHD3: the port is an easter egg
[4:01:56] MediumRareOG: there's a teleport to gorgrond in timeless isle? TIL

[4:02:14] Sparklefartz: they make the books because after Wotlk people didnt care about the store, only game balance and gameplay
[4:02:25] bojackhorseman2004: its in an underwater cave, idk if it is lore related
[4:02:30] Lausten: @MediumRareOG Yeah it was a way to skip the intro back in the day
[4:02:37] chelfx: @Sparklefartz they made books before wrath lol
[4:02:48] mewchow: wasnt it the black prince took garrosh back to pandaria
[4:02:55] bojackhorseman2004: the books before wrath werent mandetory
[4:03:00] bojackhorseman2004: and just lore expanding
[4:03:12] Sparklefartz: ^^
[4:03:16] Sparklefartz: what i should have said
[4:03:23] Sparklefartz: now they carry major plot points for story
[4:03:26] chelfx: i would say only a few have been since wrath
[4:03:28] CianoHD3: @mewchow he planned it but couldn't take him back
[4:03:42] Lausten: I really wish I could play throuh Pandaria and WoD again, like with the removed quests, I feel like I have a huge lore gap cause of the removed quests..
[4:03:42] chelfx: With the Garrosh book and Syvanas book are two examples
[4:03:48] CpnRad: cant believe 10.6 is only 30 mins away
[4:03:52] bojackhorseman2004: what happend?
[4:03:57] ratgefingah: what news u think we getting
[4:04:13] bojackhorseman2004: sounded like u stepped on a cat or somthing, really beating urself down xD
[4:04:17] Shrandamar: would be funny tho if they just ninja dropped the patch when nobody expected it lol
[4:04:28] ratgefingah: im thinking more Hero talents
[4:04:29] chelfx: i think it will
[4:04:35] chelfx: will you play some cata beta?
[4:04:35] CianoHD3: start this week yes, announced no
[4:04:40] Sparklefartz: im expecting to be dissapointed like always KEKW
[4:04:46] atroyabelladonna: They did do quite a bit of maintenance last week
[4:05:10] Sparklefartz: @atroyabelladonna the SoD servers are literally melting
[4:05:19] xmalthael02: Promotions?
[4:05:23] Sparklefartz: t
[4:06:06] CianoHD3: @xmalthael02 they just did 3 so i dont see them doing any more just yet

[4:08:05] Jack_the_Dipper: You ever heard of Marc Rebillet? @MrGM
[4:08:30] Lausten: Told ya

[4:09:59] chelfx: i cannot wait for cata classic ngl
[4:09:59] bojackhorseman2004: I hope we get another metzon tween where he tries to search for hes own name xD
[4:10:03] Layliah79: ü§ûüèΩ
[4:10:16] bojackhorseman2004: tweet*
[4:10:28] mikael_jansson90: u want to hear something sad....i saw the void talon portal and was like 20 steps away and it despawned
[4:10:31] Harper_n7: I don't know if I could care less about Cata Classic...
[4:10:43] MediumRareOG: i didn't get excited about classic TBC, wrath and definitely not Cata YMMV
[4:10:47] MajorFrog225: shadowlands classic
[4:10:59] chelfx: cata was the xpack i started in
[4:11:00] CpnRad: if they rework all of Dragon Soul I may care about Cata classi
[4:11:03] chelfx: its 14 years old
[4:11:04] alextheblight: I miss tbc classic
[4:11:08] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:11:17] alextheblight: sweet
[4:11:30] Harper_n7: Wasn't the whole point of classic to go back to the old world and play the old way?
[4:11:37] bojackhorseman2004: Classic wrath had less players than tbc, which had less players that classic, same with phase 2 of sod. Not suprised if cata isnt popular
[4:11:42] ratgefingah: u deserve them Dan
[4:11:42] bojackhorseman2004: but its low effort content so
[4:11:52] ascendence94: @MrGM also arnt we already doing cata by making a new character in retail and leveling in the current world LUL
[4:12:06] Thoreya: not if theyre bringing back mop
[4:12:16] chelfx: it doesnt seem like blizzard wants todo What If stuff
[4:12:19] Thoreya: LUL
[4:12:21] alextheblight: true
[4:12:24] chelfx: @ascendence94 same with wrath and tbc
[4:12:31] funviking99: people voted for cata
[4:12:42] funviking99: yes
[4:12:44] MajorFrog225: bfa classic?
[4:12:44] chelfx: they did a survay
[4:12:46] funviking99: in that survery thing
[4:12:49] Thoreya: i did, at least in the survey they sent us
[4:12:50] chelfx: and asked if peoplew anted it
[4:13:05] CianoHD3: did they not send out a survey that asked if they wanted new wrath content or cata with some changes
[4:13:16] Thoreya: its prob the best way to do it
[4:13:17] funviking99: I wanted mop tbh
[4:13:18] bojackhorseman2004: random survay? you mean the offical survey by the devs?
[4:13:22] chelfx: they did it for wrath calssic
[4:13:29] Shrandamar: there are people who never played cata and probably wants to see it
[4:13:31] Lausten: I didnt get the survey, but I guess im not the target audience for classic anyways
[4:13:38] mrsrockguru: I have just got out of the pandarian starting zone, at lvl 17.
[4:13:41] ratgefingah: maybe cata classic will expand on sod and b4 the cataclysm some time god appears and stops deathwing, which starts the classic plus cycle
[4:13:42] bojackhorseman2004: why are people trying to undermine them asking the community just becuse the results dont line up to personal opinions
[4:13:50] FinestGoldy: heyy!
[4:13:55] MediumRareOG: Cata didn't feel like an expansion to me. it was just an odd collection of randomly changed zones (for the worse)
[4:14:21] Thoreya: its like jak saying no one wants hero talents LUL
[4:14:24] bojackhorseman2004: and what surveys have you done? asking your chat?
[4:14:36] Layliah79: OMG i want 10.2.6 so bad!!! peepoPls
[4:14:44] Sparklefartz: first patch of cata was amazing but when they couldnt do FIRE AND ICE it fell flat and became a PvP expansion
[4:14:48] bojackhorseman2004: I am just being real, dont wanna  come across as agressive
[4:15:10] MediumRareOG: @Layliah79 Do you KNOW you want 10.2.6? Have you run surveys? LULW
[4:15:12] neverbornlucky: MrGm I'm excited for shadowlands classics
[4:15:14] ratgefingah: I wanna play mists , cuz I never played it and I like pandas
[4:15:21] chelfx: @Sparklefartz Firelands has become one of the goat raids
[4:15:29] MajorFrog225: this is the only time ive heard someone mention classic cata
[4:15:30] Harper_n7: I've been to a ton of different streamers' chats and a couple guilds and like maybe a handful of people are excited... it's so weird that Blizzard went this route
[4:15:38] CianoHD3: i just hope they don't get rid of WOTLK servers when Cata comes out
[4:15:45] Layliah79: @MediumRareOG OMG mrgmZ
[4:15:50] chelfx: @CianoHD3 they are
[4:15:55] Shrandamar: @CianoHD3 they will :\
[4:15:59] Lausten: Vanilla, TBC and Wrath was for sure the "old" era of WoW, with the changes to the world in Cata the game changed in a way that many people didnt like..
[4:16:07] alextheblight: it's so dumb
[4:16:08] Layliah79: I wish i had time for Classic. Retail keeps me busy outside of work/life.
[4:16:17] bojackhorseman2004: I agree, not sure why they are removing the wrath servers
[4:16:17] Harper_n7: they're gonna get rid of the wrath servers?? LUL
[4:16:26] Layliah79: Wrath was the peak
[4:16:43] MediumRareOG: how popular were cata private servers?
[4:16:47] Thoreya: wrath is hella dead rn tho
[4:16:48] kpatt17: Dumb question, but do they have servers available for vanilla and BC?
[4:16:50] Thoreya: as someone whos been playing
[4:16:53] ascendence94: @MrGM lets be honest were all waiting for shadowlands or wod classic Kappa
[4:16:55] CpnRad: i think finally killing the Lich King who carried WC3 made people check out of WoW
[4:17:00] chelfx: Cata was also the era of other AAA mmos popping up like star wars, Rift, Guild wars 2, ESO
[4:17:08] Layliah79: Think it's because down the road we'll be seeing Season of Discovery in BC and Wrath?
[4:17:25] Lausten: @kpatt17 Only vanilla, not BC
[4:17:33] ratgefingah: I feel like they just wanna give ppl who didn‚Äôt get to play those expansions/capitalize on those ppl the possibility to play them at launch
[4:17:38] alextheblight: could be cool
[4:18:05] Layliah79: i don't play it all anyways but maybe that's why they moved onto Cata.
[4:18:08] bojackhorseman2004: I think its fine them re releasing all the expansions so people can play whichever expansion they prefer. I wish they would keep them up
[4:18:23] bojackhorseman2004: Then do a "cycle" and keep releasing them after a couple of years
[4:18:31] Shrandamar: It probably doesnt cost them much at this point to restore the later expansions, the process is figured out now
[4:19:03] Layliah79: These "classic" releases give newer players a chance to see the older content live vs what you would get of it in retail leveling.

[4:19:13] Getcha_Pulll: if I get nostalgic I just level a new toon by selecting that expansion timeline with Chromie, works for me every time lol
[4:19:20] Greyborn1: Yo just getting back into WoW just hit 60 onward to DF
[4:19:41] bojackhorseman2004: The only thing i can think of is that they want to keep "re releasing" wrath to get that "release" hype
[4:19:48] mrsrockguru: congrats @Greyborn1
[4:19:57] chelfx: Hot take i wish Reforging was still in the game, aslo i miss Gems with Red blue green and meta
[4:19:57] MediumRareOG: I'm fine with them doing Cata. I don't think it'll be popular but we will see. They'll keep doing it until it's not popular
[4:19:58] kpatt17: I think it becomes challenging because the more expansions you offer, the more you separate out the community playing a largely multiple player game. The way they are doing it now just seems to be grabbing our attention and moving us around from classic and retail.
[4:20:07] HuntingElk: wonder what the figures are for new player to wow, this might be why there are doing what they are doing...??
[4:20:18] chelfx: @kpatt17 yeah but having one wrath server
[4:20:22] chelfx: would fix that
[4:20:25] Lausten: I had always wished for them to keep any version arround, and make you copy your character over to the new servers without a cost, so you could play all versions when ever you felt like it, shrink servers, make character names have a sirname of your battle tag if needed to shrink servers and avoid duplicate names, or even just add the old server names as character when shrunk down..
[4:20:26] Greyborn1: enjoying it as zandalari fury warrior. played in SL but back now
[4:20:55] Greyborn1: I think its about the same but I am just questing
[4:20:59] Sparklefartz: they wil lstop classic after MoP
[4:21:01] Sparklefartz: id assume
[4:21:10] Greyborn1: endgame sounds the same M+/Raid weekly/Weekly big quests
[4:21:13] Sparklefartz: im excited to see what happens after MoP classic, if we get cata we get MoP
[4:21:22] Shrandamar: I want Legion Classic :P
[4:21:22] Sparklefartz: WoD raiding wasnt good enough for classic
[4:21:23] alextheblight: 100% gonna happen
[4:21:28] Layliah79: i just want BFA timewalking mrgmTea
[4:21:31] bojackhorseman2004: classic wod be fine if they speed run through the patches
[4:21:31] Sparklefartz: and its too hard for most players today
[4:21:34] CpnRad: I can't wait for Classic Classic
[4:21:41] chelfx: Hoter take Wod wasnt bad just we only got 2/3 of a xpack
[4:21:43] ascendence94: @MrGM dont u want classic wod #NO CHANGES  Kappa
[4:21:44] alextheblight: classic cata was a surprise, for sure
[4:21:48] ascendence94: LUL
[4:21:50] Sparklefartz: 99% of players today could NOT kill Blast Furance bossfight on heroic lol
[4:21:58] CianoHD3: honestly i loved WoD the only problem with it was the time between patches
[4:22:01] Sparklefartz: ybe not 99, 95ma
[4:22:02] RosieSeren: I don't even play classic but I felt they should of stopped at Wrath
[4:22:09] kpatt17: @chelfx and @Lausten valid that would make a lot of sense.
[4:22:10] Lausten: Everyone thought wrath was the end, so yeah I dont see them stopping at this point, and at this rate, classic will be out before retail versions of the new expansions... Kappa
[4:22:11] Layliah79: think people were shocked cause Cata changed the literally landscape of the game
[4:22:14] alextheblight: yep. Going beyond wotlk just seems backwards (ironically enough)
[4:22:19] Goblocker: but I don't want classic wod
[4:22:30] bojackhorseman2004: dont forget, cata had the highest playr nr in all of wow history
[4:22:36] neverbornlucky: mrgm give me classic shadowlands
[4:22:36] Shrandamar: oh yeah, Bajheera started in cata, he was really excited about playing it :P
[4:22:44] bojackhorseman2004: yes
[4:22:47] chelfx: Cata did
[4:22:50] Sparklefartz: first patch of cata was awesome
[4:22:56] ascendence94: no that was icc wraith i thought
[4:22:57] Goblocker: wod has some great zones and the tier sets are real nice but....not sure about classic wod
[4:23:00] Greyborn1: riding wotlk hype
[4:23:11] RosieSeren: should of just expanded beyond wrath, maybe SoD style or just do unfinished things
[4:23:12] v3sur: computer enhance
[4:23:13] ascendence94: o lol
[4:23:23] CianoHD3: not wrong but not right either
[4:23:23] Greyborn1: I mean wotlk into a dragon destroying the planet? How could its opening not been popular!
[4:23:25] bojackhorseman2004: failing from success
[4:23:30] Layliah79: is there a chart from Vanilla to now?
[4:23:31] Sparklefartz: DS is legit the worst raid ever made, 2nd is Heart Of Fear
[4:23:33] Shrandamar: wod technically did better than MoP lol
[4:23:37] MediumRareOG: People logged onto Cata once and we like "F this" and unsubscribed LUL
[4:23:38] Sparklefartz: patches 1 and 2 of MoP SUCKED
[4:23:41] kpatt17: Is this looking into the future of classic? They trying to kill it? LUL
[4:23:42] Sparklefartz: someof the worst patches in WoW
[4:23:46] chelfx: they stopped in wod
[4:23:51] CianoHD3: @Layliah79 after WoD they stopped reporting it
[4:23:57] Sparklefartz: yea people forget MOST of MoP actually sucked
[4:24:03] Lausten: Best indication on how retail is doing is number of M+ runs imo
[4:24:05] Sparklefartz: like really badly
[4:24:17] bomayaa: @Sparklefartz it really didn't
[4:24:19] Layliah79: When did Mythic raiding come out?
[4:24:31] chelfx: wod
[4:24:34] CianoHD3: @Layliah79 WOD
[4:24:35] ratgefingah: oh
[4:24:35] adampanerabread: SoO
[4:24:35] Sparklefartz: retail PvP gets 0 balance
[4:24:36] Lausten: SoO MoP

[4:25:54] chelfx: to prep people for mythic
[4:25:57] bojackhorseman2004: I started in wod and actually really liked the leveling experience and raids where fun on a casual level. I stopped playing pretty early thou
[4:25:59] chelfx: in wod
[4:26:03] CianoHD3: yeah in MoP it was LFR flex Normal Heroic and in pre patch it was LFR Normal heroic Mythic
[4:26:09] MediumRareOG: tusks dropped from mythic and heroic
[4:26:15] Iwony: we had flex back then
[4:26:28] Sparklefartz: WoD is when they really started with the dumb hard mechanics in mythic most players cant do until its nerfed into the ground
[4:26:29] Lausten: @MediumRareOG They still do, and they have different IDs LUL
[4:26:31] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[4:27:04] CpnRad: the skip to Garrosh is so nice
[4:27:20] MediumRareOG: tusks are a 0.5% drop allegedly
[4:27:23] Greyborn1: warrior friend of mine found the mount for the 3rd time yesterday still no tusks lol
[4:27:25] funviking99: got them in 60 tries LUL
[4:27:29] RosieSeren: how much are you going bet on wow news lol
