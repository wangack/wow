[2:24:39] doxxee: blizzard would get the feedback and then do something silly like YouTube drops.
[2:24:41] Aervyper: I guess they do do drops semi yearly in the form of store drops..... too bad i deleted blizzard login
[2:25:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol subreddits
[2:25:23] pooohf: yessir im here getting the drops lmao
[2:26:05] Jorzah: B)
[2:26:07] Aervyper: @Towelliee wow is a more refined  community it just complains about cosmetic store
[2:26:10] wayneclarkedev: HotS drops! :D
[2:26:16] manmower: drop legendary recipes or soul ash
[2:26:38] hurnen: I think I am going to re-purchase New World... I bought it and played a few levels and was on the fence but seeing you play it, along with some other streamers makes it seem like it will be popular.
[2:26:39] NIGHT_SHADE1x: work smarter not harder keep them tabd and muted LUL
[2:26:59] Aervyper: ohhhhhh different drops that is just stupid it's not even bad it's moronic
[2:27:01] SpoofAvatar: overthinking the drops system it seems

[2:28:33] Aervyper: OMG 1 month of game time....... wow would be top 3  on twitch til it ended
[2:28:36] miku1: if its free game time people are gonna complain about bots claiming the game time
[2:28:41] MrGattz: even if the drop was just a 2 week game time token. make it a random drop from nearly every mob in the game and they are non tradable.
[2:28:43] Scoodles91: but but i payed for mine, why would someone get one for free. first comment below thge news :D
[2:29:41] awkswow: Ah! Figured it out.. Syed [9:18:03 AM] : In order to receive free server transfer token, players had to log into the game between OCT-20 and NOV-22 As the player was not active at all at this time, they are not eligible to receive server transfer token.

[2:30:24] Aervyper: @Towelliee one good thing is if you did it they could make the token trackable and see what the money it generates after it cause you could understand and cost it out
[2:30:38] Sollice: Katie has a friend who use to work at Blizzard and he gave us game time for like 5 years. We would ask and he would say one second and blam codes
[2:30:40] MrGattz: oh are we talking twitch drops? i mean thats also a great idea. idk why they dont do twitch drops from random streams. can be any time from anyone and its like a 0.2% drop rate.
[2:30:40] Aervyper: yea  but isn't overwatch a Youtube thing now
[2:31:11] Boats_NW: pretty sure all blizz esports moved to youtube not just overwatch
[2:31:36] itsapaul: The dungeon esports are on here
[2:31:52] Aervyper: i forgot that overwatch was still a thing until i seen overwatch league on youtube by chance one day
[2:31:52] mikelalmeida: is this ice gear part of the event or was it available already?
[2:32:10] Aervyper: literally forgot
[2:32:18] lucidityd: event

[2:33:33] awkswow: @Rudi_Ice Not dead, but development on OW has pretty much stopped since OW2 got announced
[2:33:47] awkswow: and subsequently delayed...
[2:34:13] doxxee: they looked at those League of Legends numbers and wanted that pie... but completely different audience.
[2:34:15] Nokterian: Youtube still hasn't options unlike twitch from what i have seen
[2:34:42] avocadorable2022: Im still waiting for the Towelliee nft collection.

[2:35:20] Nokterian: the story i think is be more a bot match with a story
[2:35:22] Aervyper: @Nokterian pat mcafee show is good
[2:35:35] nikodemuscrowley: towellie's peach ring - gfuel

[2:37:14] ILikeKillTheZombies: What will be after onlyfans? There's always something new
[2:37:29] Rudric_Ice: thing is we already  have Onlyfans on twitch  just go to just chatting
[2:37:30] cataJJ: cataJJ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! good to hear homie

[2:41:39] Kajkage: Yeah Saw that. yikes me
[2:41:47] ditaern: @redcapcombo For some 'couch co-op'?
[2:41:59] Darkwield: i think its even harder than that
[2:42:27] de_Zizzo: when Google tried to make their own Facebook
[2:42:32] Sollice: The problem with Youtube streaming is youtubes website
[2:42:34] ILikeKillTheZombies: Some sheik needs to make a streaming service
[2:42:51] balancedlight: Will you be playing wow today?
[2:43:10] Nerdmeat_: I keep tweeting at youtube that they could have me for less than $100k a year
[2:43:10] Moobot: Yes Towelliee has rerolled a new character on Eden with the Towelliee name!
[2:43:40] Meepzter: imagine being on a platform without Kappa or 4Head . Sounds pretty boring! LUL
[2:43:47] ILikeKillTheZombies: Im from poland so i also watch some polish streamers that have like 50 viewers and they can go by without IRL job easily, so i think twitch is pretty good for many
[2:44:02] Nokterian: seeing the difference of youtube and twitch in options is staggering.
[2:44:09] miku1: anyone know where i find goats?
[2:44:40] Arkynine: Daaang towelliee looking festive and breedable lul
[2:44:40] Nerdmeat_: LOL like they give a shit about me. lol I have like 70 subs on youtube
[2:44:53] Alobar42069: getting rid of dislikes on YT is such a horrible decision
[2:44:56] rfnatboy: tornisWeird
[2:44:58] Arkynine: <3 u buddy
[2:45:02] Nokterian: towCringe
[2:45:20] manmower: too negative
[2:45:24] E_Z24: dislikes are too toxic LUL
[2:45:30] Zenghorn: lol
[2:45:35] ILikeKillTheZombies: It's bad and good decision, because sometimes you get all this dislike bombing
[2:45:36] TheUnknowing: you can dislike them, just you cant see the dislike numbers only creators can see dislikes on their videos
[2:45:36] Nokterian: nope
[2:45:37] wwwyzzerd: you can if you want
[2:45:39] manmower: too many people brigading the downvote
[2:45:41] ILikeKillTheZombies: like on steam, bad review bombs
[2:45:41] Aervyper: because disliking somone is BADDDDDDDDDDDDDD u know it means you don't agree and hurt feelings
[2:45:43] DeanoTV: theres a chrome extension to add it back
[2:45:46] Nokterian: only you can see the dislikes
[2:45:57] lestat692k7: bad content should be able to be pointed out
[2:45:58] SupAngrytroll: public can't see it
[2:46:02] Alobar42069: Imagine trying to watch a video about fixing ur computer but the guy making the video is doing it wrong but no one knows they are from looking at dislikes
[2:46:16] Nokterian: but still it gives you bad videos and you dont know if it is good or bad
[2:46:19] E_Z24: remember the diablo immortal dislike ratio LUL
[2:46:19] Heisenberst: You can dislike, the count is not public though, I believe the creator can still see the count.
[2:46:22] vermei11: thats rare
[2:46:36] Aervyper: @E_Z24 where is diablo immortal anyways
[2:46:37] wwwyzzerd: infinite warfare dislikes were jusitifed
[2:46:40] LiveJuniorr: Are World of Warcraft servers down?
[2:46:50] E_Z24: @Aervyper oh a phone far far away
[2:46:50] s7wede: The problem with saying it's just dislike bombs is that the opposite also exists.
[2:46:56] Alobar42069: it‚Äôs censorship
[2:46:58] Calphurnious: They should remove the like buttons too if people can't voice their opinion with a dislike
[2:47:07] Namtarts_TV: what i have found is that it has nothing to do with individuals like asmon
[2:47:09] Oneeye2cu: Morning Towelliee Morning stream
[2:47:09] Nokterian: you dislike because it is your opinion but youtube thought well we get rid of it and all is good in that regard
[2:47:24] itscityboy: Is this game still improving?
[2:47:34] Namtarts_TV: it has to do with individuals down voting corporate videos
[2:47:36] TheUnknowing: I mean as I said you can still dislike videos, the dislikes just aren't publicly viewable
[2:47:38] Namtarts_TV: that everyone knows is fake bs
[2:47:42] mayonaes: You can still comment on it
[2:47:45] mayonaes: yeah
[2:47:49] mayonaes: facts
[2:47:52] itscityboy: Some people say "like for dislike" KEKW
[2:47:53] lestat692k7: truth
[2:47:54] Nokterian: depends if the channel let comment it
[2:47:58] Jokervenom1978: @Towelliee Did you see that John madden passed?
[2:47:59] Alienfromger: not always
[2:48:00] vermei11: for now
[2:48:01] Aervyper: @itscityboy you can dress like wheel of time does that improve anything?
[2:48:02] Namtarts_TV: you cant read comments as fast as a downvote
[2:48:07] Namtarts_TV: one is easier
[2:48:11] definitely_not_steelmage: you can delete comments though as a creater
[2:48:13] LurkerJone: You can dislike though, it's just the count isn't public to discourage people from jumping on the bandwagon or sometthing *shrugs*
[2:48:16] beckett3a: yeah but doesnt commenting feed the video to the gorithm? dunno
[2:48:16] Calphurnious: They can remove comments
[2:48:22] Alobar42069: comment section is also tailored
[2:48:23] itscityboy: @Aervyper I'll take what we can get lol
[2:48:24] kashmara: if the comments are even on
[2:48:25] lestat692k7: yeah truth some people turn comments off for videos
[2:48:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: first person on a video should just make a comment that says like this to dislike so it its at the top
[2:48:33] Dumbsized: been struggling to keep coin in NW anyone think an alt would help?
[2:48:42] SupAngrytroll: if you want to see the dislikes you can get stupid add-on
[2:48:53] Aervyper: @Towelliee i watched a youtube video and a guy said even the dislikes count in the metric so i don't know why they took it out
[2:49:09] rfnatboy: nice burger king helm
[2:49:20] E_Z24: pretty sure they said they will be bricking any addons for dislikes
[2:49:31] mayonaes: Leaving a comment on why you dislike a video is more constructive than just hitting a thumbs down button.
[2:49:32] ILikeKillTheZombies: imagine the amount if dislikes on next WoW expansion reveal video
[2:49:36] ILikeKillTheZombies: of*
[2:49:40] N3llee: it only used the dislikes if you have the plugin. it doesn't retroactive.
[2:49:48] s7wede: The addon won't be able to see the dislike in the next API update. At the moment the UI just hides them in the metadata, but that is soon going to be a fixed
[2:49:52] mayonaes: Big dingaling

[2:50:15] thecleaner4k: How's New World? Was out of country for 5 weeks and came back to alot of people server transferring from YS. Haven't been on myself since then really. Was in The Order/Blacklisted in Syndicate on YS.
[2:50:15] E_Z24: yea thats what i thought was stated as well @s7wede
[2:51:31] lestat692k7: it is what it is
[2:51:40] thecleaner4k: Oh snap haha
[2:51:53] E_Z24: oh is PAX still a thing on Eden or did they get run off lol?

[2:52:50] Molvonos: Glob got run off for being hot shit.
[2:53:03] E_Z24: i just remember them saying they were gonna go run eden when they left LUL
[2:53:05] thecleaner4k: Hahaha Glob shot himself in the foot. Got caught ion a call saying he would faction swap and take the treasury with him
[2:53:24] thecleaner4k: Alot of people turned on Glob
[2:53:56] thecleaner4k: Sadly I missed most of the war conflicts. Came back from vacation and everyone had dipped
[2:54:18] thecleaner4k: Oh 100%
[2:54:26] abiduel: thts me
[2:54:35] abiduel: pvp brings toxicity naturally
[2:54:50] thecleaner4k: He was/is incredibly toxic in game. In my opinion. Seems like a decent guy but a handful in game
[2:54:52] FeliciaHarty: same as people you can hang out with but not work with. also, morning! dataWave
[2:54:58] manmower: @abiduel yea that hardcore pvp crowd have issues
[2:55:19] thecleaner4k: Nerve left to?
[2:55:20] Sollice: That STIFF shit was dumb too
[2:55:23] thecleaner4k: *too?
[2:55:24] Sollice: I will remember for the next time
[2:55:37] TheUnknowing: stiff was toxic
[2:55:46] abiduel: !server
[2:55:46] Moobot: @abiduel Towelliee is playing on the FF14 server Gilgamesh
[2:55:48] Sollice: I am when they formed
[2:56:16] Sollice: I dont think we are going to go hard core on a company on Lost Ark like we did for NW, I could be wrong
[2:56:29] Sollice: But there are some definite black lists that happened
[2:56:35] E_Z24: well dont forget Lost Ark guilds are capped at 30 until you level them
[2:56:40] Scoodles91: the dominating yellow company on my server "mysteriously" got bored of the game same day as the wave of bans for the dupes :D
[2:56:53] Molvonos: I can only hardcore one or  two games, until I blow up as furry Vtuber onlyfans streamer.
[2:56:56] Alobar42069: what‚Äôs it like mining orichalcum
[2:57:06] thecleaner4k: Yea our server in the beginning was fun. Used to run into you all the time,  was one of The Order's more powerful healers at the time
[2:57:32] thecleaner4k: Good times.
[2:57:41] manmower: this trend of making games into second jobs is lame
[2:57:42] E_Z24: the big problem i have with lost ark guilds... is the cap of 30 people until you level the guild
[2:58:01] SupAngrytroll: block+jump
[2:58:13] thecleaner4k: More chests around the corner by the way. 2-3 that are hidden

[2:59:36] Sollice: @E_Z24 I am sure it will
[2:59:52] Sollice: I thought they had DX11 in beta
[2:59:59] E_Z24: no DX9 LUL
[3:00:57] E_Z24: thats why the fuckin cities were terrible to load in and stand in... the amount of fps lag in those big cities while runnin dx9 was horrible
[3:00:57] thecleaner4k: Thanks for the info, may get back into the game if thats the case
