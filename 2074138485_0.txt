[2:45:47] Devcomz: From what I gathered from this patch comes out then they PTR the next season and release next season after
[2:46:04] ImHomegr0wn: yeah, the souls from consume magic also did not get the same treatment that fodder did right before they removed fodder
[2:46:29] ImHomegr0wn: right before they removed fodder, they made it so the souls spawn near you but the blood moon souls just spawn near the pet you purged
[2:46:42] honsou2: @Devcomz isnt there always a weeks delay between patch and season
[2:46:48] honsou2: or is that only s1
[2:47:28] ImHomegr0wn: I have a WA go off when I rng the double buff for 40%

[2:49:20] Devcomz: Its hard to say this specific wording says that they are doing something different. How I perceived this sentence is they are releasing the new patch cause they wanted to surprise people with stuff. Then they will put a PTR up with the new Season in the blue post I linked @honsou2. Which means we might not see new Season until probably April but no later than Early May I guess. DF seasons have been 6 months though so April will be month 6 of this season
[2:49:55] ImHomegr0wn: omnibar's update earlier might have finally fixed the action bar block that's been plagued for most people since dragon flight pre patch
[2:50:49] honsou2: @Devcomz But a new patch ends the last season. So there isnt gonna be a big gap. The PTR they mention will just be a week, 2 at the most
[2:51:33] Devcomz: According to what I heard PTR have like a month life cycle for small content like this
[2:51:45] TheEyeVII: ya war within "hype" is none existent but sod's one died really quickly
[2:51:47] Notreallygood: Mes do you only play destiny on your dh?
[2:51:49] Devcomz: So April fits the season cycle for seasons in DF so far
[2:52:46] honsou2: @Devcomz they have never done a PTR this small

[2:52:59] StreamElements: Download Sea of Conquest for free now! Complete Chapters 4 and 7, and recruit Cordelia to support the stream! https://strms.net/sea_of_conquest_notmes
[2:53:49] honsou2: @Devcomz its gonna be patch last week of march and then 1 week or 2 weeks before season starts (2 weeks with no season would be awful and drain subs tho) so likely just 1 week
[2:53:53] Devcomz: @honsou2 Yeah but they probably want people to do the different affixes and what not with Mythic plus.
[2:54:56] Devcomz: In another stream I was talking to someone named Drathimos and I agree with what he said with it being April. Its enough time after MDI and AWC and fits the 6 month cycle for seasons that DF has had
[2:55:09] Devcomz: We are almost in March so April is not far away
[2:55:13] Devcomz: Wont be too long
[2:55:44] Devcomz: I also cant believe we are almost in March already too lol

[3:35:01] Mazerrise: Mines so messy by comparison
[3:35:38] TheEyeVII: I like threat plates better
[3:36:17] Mazerrise: I've tried that as well, why do you prefer that?
[3:37:53] jessiemayy12: I guess what's diff about mop was it felt like you had more skill of gameplay mechanic. Retail seems like specifically trading cd? I could be wrong. I've been glad each time I've played. But you are the best I would like to hear your thought on the difference? Sorry for the LONG ass reply
[3:38:36] TheEyeVII: I like their hp bars layouts better & the customization is nice

[3:40:49] TheEyeVII: if cata dies as quickly as everyone thinks it will, I doubt they do mop classic, aside for a pure "epic edition" cash grab
[3:41:05] jessiemayy12: SL*
[3:42:04] jessiemayy12: theyll def do mop classic
[3:44:06] honsou2: yeah if theyre doing cata i think theyre doing mop

[3:44:19] TheEyeVII: they'll do anything that gives them easy money & least amount of dev time, it'll die fast af tho, cuz people wanted classic releases for the 1st trilogy not basically retail world revamp & on
[3:45:06] honsou2: as long as there is no wod classic

[3:46:12] TheEyeVII: they found their classic-only player cashcow I think with sod, just do spins like that witha gimmick like runes every few years & those players will stay subbed
[3:46:26] honsou2: damn lol
[3:46:35] honsou2: i insta quit wod because every class was so extremely boring compared to mop
[3:47:47] TheEyeVII: there's noway they invest dev time into some "wod+" rerelease, just make player housing while you're at it & waste dev time on that for retail or guild housing w/e
