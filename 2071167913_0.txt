[1:29:25] biddlybee: good is an overstatement, he just plays mage
[1:32:33] biddlybee: defo the hunter for the 10% stats
[1:33:36] TadpoleBill: They cost 2g at Ally xD
[1:34:55] EtienneTV: Depends on the spells, for example your fire blast is base damage +70% of spell power. Just pulling numbers out of my ass, it's on wowhead
[1:40:01] LoupyEU: bandages on the hotbars and healer sitting down to drink between pulls - dem classic vibes lol.  When levelling was tough!
[1:46:37] eatsleeprepeatx: would you setup your ui different if you decided to main sod?

[1:46:40] eatsleeprepeatx: like elv etc
[1:48:35] ayahirano: @scripe good morning sir are you gonna play retail today?
[1:48:36] eatsleeprepeatx: what changes would you do?
[1:49:17] Cyberz_: wow retail is looking sick
[1:52:02] LoupyEU: the amount of blocking that shaman tank doing is so high.  He seems to literally block everything
[1:52:38] Yngvezs: you need to be 36/37 to be effective in cath man
[1:59:06] qabraa: u need t o go gym
[2:00:26] Tjaker: What class/spec do you think is the hardest these days in retai?
[2:01:53] Hammel_TV: combat
[2:03:05] denny2808: @Tjaker mage
[2:03:20] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[2:04:04] Tjaker: Nice thx for the help :D
[2:04:33] denny2808: in general i think healer is the hardest to play and it's probably one of these classes
[2:05:02] razzktv: isnt a tank spec the hardest to play due to role impact etc.?
[2:06:10] razzktv: if personally feel a bit bored as healer in m+
[2:07:22] EtienneTV: healing in keys is so weird. Everything hits the fan while pugging, but in a premade either nothing does damage or it's one shots which isn't your problem most of the time anyways
[2:07:33] razzktv: what would you say might be the "biggest skills" for a good raid healer?
[2:08:32] Eliannoula: its daunting thinking about what i need to set up and learn if i wanna play wow ngl
[2:09:17] 0rektquiem: It is *very* daunting. I just started recently and I'm kinda overwhelmed. But I'm trying to take it one step at a time
[2:10:03] EtienneTV: @0rektquiem I'd say get a good grasp of the game before throwing in a top notch UI you barely know what to do with :)
[2:10:22] Eliannoula: ya from rotation to addons to routes to then learn the actual game and what it provides etc
[2:10:35] 0rektquiem: Yeah, that's exactly what I did lol. Took a bit of adjusting to get used to the new ui lol
[2:10:50] araldor123: When I come back to wow after a long time i get a basic UI then add a few new bits every now and then until its good again
[2:10:51] tickdickla: best thing to do is go arm>cath for each reset so you dont hit lockout
[2:11:06] 0rektquiem: I'm currently at finding out and learning how to gear and where to start and all the systems etc etc
[2:16:37] Scripe: !title

[2:26:52] Molkohr: watching you casually kill packs of mobs as mage makes me Sadge as warrior
[2:26:53] stillsuitstk: healers are good
[2:26:54] Cyberz_: priest is meta i think
[2:27:01] Wraiyth_: It makes arcane blast give 40% chance to proc 2.5s casr zero mana arcane missiles, it makes arcane super fun
[2:27:04] stillsuitstk: priest is meta but mages op damage healers
[2:27:11] Cyberz_: mage b tier according to archon

[4:22:49] Kemskemss: tbh kinda, yeah :D in all seriousness it is a bit odd to me why ppl play two versions of the same game
[4:23:00] Eliannoula: @Whitewolf1441 ya SOD is not hardcore :D
[4:23:17] Kemskemss: @Whitewolf1441 u did -) I don't think SoD hc even exists now

[4:23:55] Eliannoula: well 20 min till meeting anyways
[4:24:30] freakngjustin: friendslist
[4:24:32] Kemskemss: @sdjfn maybe. I guess it depends on how far (?) your point of view is. in its core they're the same. in details probably are very diff
[4:25:31] sdjfn: Retail is more gameplay focused, classic is a more classical mmo
[4:26:42] stillsuitstk: yes living flame does benefit
