[1:23:57] Drostep: Lol
[1:24:14] swordart_19: @Synthetiktek you could raid log since release of game , you know what is wrong cutting things from these who play more .
[1:24:15] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[1:25:39] Drostep: I hope they stop at Wrath classic
[1:25:40] DecayedmiNt: @swordart_19 They didn't tho, outside of grinds that people constantly bitch about. You still have the core that was there from the start. Dungeons, raids, PvP, and since BC, dailies. State of those vary, but it's all there.
[1:25:45] tedol: that CPU worse than 10900k
[1:25:49] RageDriven: 3090?? sweet Jesus
[1:26:00] Almostwes: sorry im not informed but when does 9.1 drop?
[1:26:11] mrelgaato: 30
[1:26:16] Nate_h: i get my 3060 on friday
[1:26:34] Almostwes: thanks for the info!
[1:26:47] tedol: congrats on getting GPU at all
[1:26:57] dewking93: Isn’t that overkill to just play wow ?
[1:27:15] Morpserie: its never overkill are you kidding me
[1:27:17] RageDriven: "I just smile and nod" :)
[1:27:31] DecayedmiNt: Overkill doesn't exist.
[1:27:36] swordart_19: @Synthetiktek false all pve proggression is nerfed to be for raid loggers.
[1:27:43] Almostwes: origin has great builds
[1:27:46] CritcobainTV: "Hey towelliee u want this brand new 1080ti pc?" KEKW
[1:27:57] swordart_19: OMEGALUL
[1:27:59] swordart_19: who would say no LUL
[1:28:02] h_u_r_k_: WeSmart
[1:28:03] cuddlytoxic: id take that in a heart beat
[1:28:04] Morpserie: someones jealous "just to play WoW" motherfucker my 3090 screams at 3440x1440 max everything
[1:28:05] tedol: origin is on expansive side, but they very good builders
[1:28:13] filipebar: what ability absorbs those circles?
[1:28:15] venom366: if you aint first your last Kappa
[1:28:18] galgarak: still use my origin crate as a shelf :D
[1:28:32] Mecabeast: strategic marketing
[1:28:33] dewking93: I didn’t know you were just given to you if I was buying it my self would be different
[1:28:33] mmrghost7: i would say no , give me the money equivalent of it
[1:28:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: give me the worst piece of shit you have, they send you their fax machine
[1:28:39] Morpserie: @galgarak it's a good piece of furniture LUL
[1:28:47] yogapriest: how many gb is 9.1 going to be to DL?
[1:28:56] CritcobainTV: Then u take the PC and sell it
[1:29:02] CritcobainTV: EZ Clap
[1:29:02] neverbornlucky: loki episode 3 was real good be sure to catch it later
[1:29:04] mmrghost7: selling is hard
[1:29:06] tedol: Is Nvidia RT shadows patch in Wow?
[1:29:06] Charbeans: I regret not getting an Origin PC when I got mine.
[1:29:19] DelcoAF: Towel driving in a ferrari in the cul de sac
[1:29:24] Doog45: is there an unboxing video?
[1:29:29] DecayedmiNt: @swordart_19 ???? if that was true more than 2% of the playerbase would raid end game. Look at the difference even at world first level. Limit and Echo got Sire almost a week before everyone else. That's not nerfed.
[1:29:29] tedol: 3090 still going for 2,5k$ minimum
[1:29:31] devildriver1919: possibly something in contract that you cant resell it?
[1:29:33] swordart_19: @tedol since release if you got card supporting it .
[1:29:35] Sollice: Morning
[1:29:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: Best i can do is 5 bucks Kappa
[1:29:44] bob2305: it's free stuff! I mean how hard is it to accept free stuff. Jesus man
[1:29:58] tedol: @swordart_19 Wow is AMD supported game, but maybe they made it open source version
[1:30:04] swordart_19: @Synthetiktek WHen i was in school when we did projects and to back up our own claims you posted sources so do that .
[1:30:26] swordart_19: @Synthetiktek I DID NOT MEANT FIGHTS
[1:30:42] swordart_19: @Synthetiktek you cant GRIND MORE GEAR/POWER IN PVE game power grind is nerfed for raid loggers.

[1:34:21] skysinge: YEP
[1:34:24] NoorMee: just dont raid, easy solution
[1:34:26] CritcobainTV: They need to make it so that you can salvage a leggo and get the ash back to use for another slot @Towelliee
[1:34:29] CritcobainTV: so u can just make it instantly
[1:34:30] Bernardo994: man i just want the next expansion already
[1:34:30] Caibo1: "meaningful choices"
[1:34:30] tedol: yea, people said that a lot about update
[1:34:32] mewkittymon: Yes
[1:34:37] Armdel: just sounds like 2021 blizzard to me
[1:34:37] skysinge: @Caibo1 LUL
[1:34:41] spainard15: Awesome PATCH
[1:34:47] Llamatude: THD was pissed
[1:35:05] yogibearz: @Towelliee recreat leggo would be fine if you could refund your old

[1:35:09] Mecabeast: imagine the casuals who don't have gold to buy another lego piece
[1:35:19] devildriver1919: soul ash is a repeatable farm now though, and incrased
[1:35:29] Lothawia: And you can send it to alts/main
[1:35:30] Aro725: Its only 200 soul ash per run
[1:35:35] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: next reset u get 20% more soul ash , since ppll need to recraft more or less
[1:35:35] Spellko: they dont hide anymore how much youre on a hamster wheel of artificial timesinks and gatekeeping
[1:35:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah think im just gonna watch this patch play out
[1:35:37] CritcobainTV: 200 per run KEKW
[1:35:37] addictedtogaming: Oh, well that doesn't make it SO bad, but still dumb
[1:35:37] Aro725: so its alot of torg
[1:35:39] Llamatude: its the cost of the white item that blows
[1:35:45] Spellko: it became obvious at the start of bfa
[1:35:57] solotkkills: 9.1 out?
[1:36:02] tedol: are wow devs back in office?
[1:36:03] magemaster225: they want people to buy tokens to buy leggos
[1:36:15] cazhually: that's just like some lack of QA there
[1:36:16] Zonoxx_tv: Yeah, thats just turning people off, not some 200 IQ strategy
[1:36:20] addictedtogaming: 9.1 next tuesday @imbetterk1d
[1:36:23] Llamatude: nope
[1:36:24] Broomba: @towelliee frankly I am getting flying and quitting SL til next expansion
[1:36:24] TheCheeseWheel87: Blizzard made the domination gear that way to make people still have to do torghast as more "content"
[1:36:26] Lothawia: nope
[1:36:31] belaham: You also don't need to craft it day one. You can wait till you get the piece with the domination socket to recraft it.
[1:36:33] magemaster225: torghast buffs?
[1:36:38] dindu1: @imbetterk1d 29th
[1:36:46] Aro725: Yeah for leather wearers its a lot of money as well for ppl to buy new armor. And all the armor in the domination slots will never be used. So stupid
[1:36:47] Bernardo994: y do they keep doing things we dont underrstand or do 1 things we like but the slightly alter it to the point of unlessness
[1:36:47] Mecabeast: I bet they didn't allow Dom sockets on legos cause they don't know if they will keep sockets for 9.2
[1:36:48] skysinge: Ven'ari is last patch's content. Blizzard isn't worried about it
[1:36:48] Llamatude: yea
[1:36:52] Bernardo994: frustrrating
[1:36:56] mewkittymon: No
[1:37:08] filipebar: in fact if anything it will be easier in 9.1 im guessing when the eye stops being an issue
[1:37:16] Llamatude: i thought the torghast are..
[1:37:16] kabam11: Im so deeply dissapointed with shadowlands
[1:37:25] Quimby54: Torghast buffs are account wide
[1:37:35] Armdel: first day even
[1:37:36] swordart_19: ANDUIN DIES towQueen
[1:37:37] Bernardo994: that all i wanna see
[1:37:43] swordart_19: i hope he dies or he will go badass
[1:37:53] Bernardo994: ill get flying watch the lore and callll it a day
[1:37:54] Salkin15: I belive, you unlock the buffs on the main udn need to buy it on the twink
[1:37:54] adrian_fell: i genuinely have no idea where the story is going after 9.1
[1:37:54] Broomba: SL and WoD might be tied with being the most weakest expansion
[1:38:08] Samonasuke: Im excited for shamans to be useless again cause Blizzard neglects them

[1:38:36] vernare1982: back to Bearsic 👍🏻
[1:38:48] Kinghorn: no way
[1:38:49] troile87: @Towelliee I can buy anythin from venari with a character with low rep
[1:38:55] filipebar: im not thrilled with 9.1 but it will give me something to do while dealing with health stuff next month
[1:39:01] Kinghorn: they can shoot for whatever they want
[1:39:04] zarod89: grand theft necropolis
[1:39:06] Spellko: potential of any delays during this winter because of corona and people having to work at home?
[1:39:07] Kinghorn: they aint hitting november
[1:39:11] Bernardo994: too bad ill be playing FFxiv
[1:39:12] ceranac23: 9.2 january
[1:39:22] adrian_fell: its kinda weird it feels like 9.1 release took so long that people sorta moved on from shadowlands already..
[1:39:26] thenateo2: will this be a 2 patch expansion? @Towelliee
[1:39:37] Broomba: I will be playing ff14 new expansion over SL
[1:39:45] Mecabeast: no paycheck this week
[1:39:46] Llamatude: they want 9.x to be gone already. i feel this is another WOD
[1:39:56] cinnamints: Oh nice, I'll finally get a bunch of Maw stuff done without the eye. I hate only being able to be there for a bit until the penalties get irritating.
[1:40:01] Bernardo994: most ppl seem to be doing the same
[1:40:07] mewkittymon: Do you no if there is new food and pots ?
[1:40:10] hookkz: i wont
[1:40:18] Bernardo994: lol
[1:40:28] Broomba: I will get flying in SL@and quit @towelliee
[1:40:28] xiamrs: yes you will
[1:40:31] Spellko: personally the only thing i think wow does better than ffxiv is the depth of gearing and gear effects. If they had that level of gearing/grind it would be superior in practically everyway
[1:40:34] Armdel: the difference is people don't play full patches anymore. they play the first like 2 months then disappear again
[1:40:39] crestleton: I just want to play the new story missions and then dip again
[1:40:51] chappers04: most peeps will stay on tbc i reckon
[1:40:53] CardinalTX: On my DK right now and my ghouls name is Hammergobbler lets go!
[1:41:04] ninetynil: casual looking to catch up in 9.1. lets go boys!
[1:41:48] Charbeans: I think the issue is retention during a patch. Or Blizzard creating content for just patches not necessary the entire expansion. I could be wrong in my take.
[1:41:49] Llamatude: my BC is already on auto mode
[1:42:04] Kinghorn: or helping the guild
[1:42:04] magemaster225: IMO its 9.2 in February and they'll try to release Black Temple for FFXIV
[1:42:08] adrian_fell: ye BC is already raid log for me
[1:42:12] Armdel: most semi decent guild will have cleared the tbc raid content already. so alot of them could be raid logging already
[1:42:16] PotentialRage: PotentialRage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:42:21] Broomba: Wow new expansion needs to be thought out well and really taken seriously
[1:42:35] SoxenJP: Right click
[1:42:44] Firedexx: right click
[1:42:59] Firedexx: assign party button
[1:43:03] Youredoneson666: Button on top that says sent tentative party
[1:43:04] thecynicalshuffler: onbce you assign there is a send party option at the top of the window
[1:43:07] SoxenJP: Right click on the assign parry
[1:43:19] SoxenJP: Party*
[1:43:23] Moesukra: pog
[1:43:25] JansonLives: there's a "send all" button on the main menu
[1:43:28] magemaster225: thats how the updated version works
[1:43:31] magemaster225: click top left
[1:43:31] Firedexx: yeah it changed
[1:43:34] adrian_fell: ye the tier after Sanctum could very likely be 2022 i mean didnt Ny alotha come out like 7 months after Eternal palace?
[1:43:42] sonicserpent09: Is it bad if I have played off and on for years and never done a raid?
[1:43:46] VegRS: What addon do you use for mission table?
[1:43:46] xXSiebzehnXx: They changed it @towelliee
[1:43:52] Youredoneson666: you assigned groups to each mission, then on the main screen theres a button to send them all. not hard
[1:44:03] adrian_fell: yes
[1:44:03] Llamatude: yes
[1:44:05] hrdstylem: yes
[1:44:06] Blah206: Not BC or FF. Is this a new game?
[1:44:22] Sneakzx: Yes
[1:44:26] kabam11: Do u think its possible that SL will be the last expansion?
[1:44:26] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:44:37] Blah206: @kabam11 nope

[1:44:54] DecayedmiNt: @kabam11 "Lets just stop making this game that makes millions a year" YEAH
[1:44:56] Salkin15: COPIUM ah yes the scard, the scard is a dream
[1:45:24] kabam11: Last last xp
[1:45:27] ElPolloBatman: the next expansion after shadowlands is called ion storm Kappa
[1:45:42] Mecabeast: I'd like gear to be less about ilvl and more about individual pieces like having a piece from 9.0 in 9.3 would be cool.

[1:46:29] iseenoobpeoplee: nobody is going to buy it KEKW
[1:46:58] adrian_fell: 90k for a 226 cloak one week before 9.1? KEKWlaugh
[1:47:12] Mecabeast: there will probably be new darkmoon cards
[1:47:14] DecayedmiNt: Useful for alts
[1:47:16] WeaponofinfinitePleasure: next week it will be 10k gold
[1:47:50] DragonofWolves: You know, I'll never understand this about Twitch. The "live channels we think you'll like section" of the homepage... always shows me streams I'm already following... like why
[1:48:02] dreamwalker213: People will easily buy boe’s to get alts high enough ilvl for the next raid
[1:48:04] WeaponofinfinitePleasure: next week you can get 226ivl for a +6 key
[1:48:09] campingking615: Good morning everybody I hope everybody’s having a great day so far

[1:48:36] adrian_fell: draenor was the expansion that my gold issues stopped because of garrison missions
[1:48:39] DragonofWolves: OOF
[1:48:39] Poriand: or have 2 gathering profs lol
[1:48:39] DecayedmiNt: 90k gold is easier than doing a +6 in a pug.
[1:48:41] CritcobainTV: I'd assume the majority of your gold is from sale runs
[1:48:42] Blah206: 300? god damn
[1:48:50] Jokervenom1978: I regret not taking advantage of gold making in WoD. :(

[2:20:11] Somakutala: Prot always heals
[2:20:39] Mecabeast: but what if hammer of the naaruu drops again
[2:20:40] peinen: when is the gbank being introduced?
[2:20:58] Somakutala: No I mean instead of off tanking, prot paladins are the best main tanks I think
[2:22:26] teqnikirl: @Towelliee if you flip the boss so its further away from the ranged but you're in range of the healer/dps they only get 1 stack of the debuff

[2:39:20] DragonofWolves: Towelliee, and you wonder why people want Blizz to wrench themselves from activision, its like the devs dont care anymore

[2:39:49] Shallo1988: full time classic andy now lol
[2:39:56] ArcaneSyntax: They should just limit the domination sockets to 3.
[2:40:04] DragonofWolves: I just might do the story and get flying and thats it. I'm not exciting for this patch besides the story
[2:40:21] Couldbet: TRu
[2:40:24] Jarlan23: nah corruption was worse than all the systems in sl put together
[2:40:25] memnon94: actually its like 40-60 now
[2:40:27] eaglerydr: And they wonder why WoW players are leaving for other mmos
[2:40:31] micha3lsc0tt: yea im just doin new raid and stickin to tbc
[2:40:52] belfastcl: I remember early on there was a lot of hype
[2:41:07] DragonofWolves: Its like they want people to flock to TBC
[2:41:24] idenkaz_: my guild is sadly done, alot of people wont be coming back for 9.1 BibleThump
[2:41:38] MistaHat: I really think they could learn from TBC gearing process. I have an idea that would be cool to help mythic plus, why not change gear in each season. Like reuase old gear sets from dungeons. Why are we in a world where we dont really have dungeon sets with mythic plus?
[2:41:42] Couldbet: thank you
[2:41:44] Roaringkittylol: I wonder if they ever thought of just making WoW just WoW... there is a reason why TBC is growing.
[2:41:46] theeimantaz: guys is TBC actually fun? am tired of retail:>
[2:42:03] eaglerydr: We should have systems that upgrade not add on more systems
[2:42:05] BlueBeast33: Sure as hell didn't keep me playing...
[2:42:07] PapaSix: @theeimantaz Ihave more fun playing TBC than I do retail
[2:42:18] pakapasiti: what addon do you use for nameplates?
[2:42:18] kokochris: @HaxzorJimDuggan damn man you made me go watch that skit again
[2:42:24] MickyFresc: TBC doesn't have longevity though. games, especially mmos, have to innovate in the long term
[2:42:30] Triknives: Any advice for new tank Jitters?
[2:42:38] MistaHat: @theeimantaz just have fun with TBC if you play. play what you want and enjoy the pace you want.
[2:42:47] memnon94: also farming anima is much worse than ap, imo
[2:42:47] DragonofWolves: As someone who played Retail over Vanilla classic till TBC came out, i am enjoying TBC way more over classic right now
[2:43:10] noxiiiouse: @Towelliee maybe they wanna do the same thing as osrs / runescape waht you think ?
[2:43:16] Aliciaey: Aliciaey subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:43:28] Beonit: new mounts look cool
[2:43:30] desmo7: wtf

[2:43:45] desmo7: where you gunna fly to tho?
[2:43:45] Wcvechten: Flying just makes it easier
[2:43:46] meta_mind2: you get a new GPU or something?
[2:43:46] Daggerstry: I get flying just so I can see the beautiful zones from the air
[2:43:46] Roaringkittylol: Thats sad
[2:43:49] abbotatoes: Revendreth needs flying
[2:43:50] galgarak: is there the usual rep grind for flying?
[2:43:56] MickyFresc: @progettazione_inferni you can say that about basically anything when regular content is expected lol
[2:44:14] meta_mind2: @Towelliee what new specs did you get for you comp?
[2:44:15] idenkaz_: im scared that this is it.
[2:44:20] geokouts: EU token 273k gold...
[2:44:24] Bewildfire: Can honestly say I like watching you tank then another prot pally — the other prot pally I know would have ran on that last pull.
[2:44:31] Daggerstry: It is funny how terrible the content is coming from Blizzard-Activision, yet the CEO is still ranking in over 100 million
[2:44:46] MickyFresc: @Daggerstry wow isn't their only product
[2:44:56] jatral: no more alt unless they get rid of the maw intro
[2:44:56] Jarlan23: its just korthia and a new raid theres nothing else really

[2:45:18] Daggerstry: @themcfresh Ah. You right. They have teh same CoD game refreshed HUNDREDS of times
[2:45:21] Couldbet: yea that was good
[2:45:23] Blah206: I agree
[2:45:26] memnon94: also think about Argus, those zones were great imo
[2:45:26] meta_mind2: @Towelliee what new specs did you get for your comp?
[2:45:29] belaham: @Towelliee Don't forget the new mega dungeon has a hard mode
[2:45:32] MickyFresc: @Daggerstry and evidently it's doing well, so how can you fault that
[2:45:32] Amnesiac2170: new raid / dungeon will last 30 days max
[2:45:33] mikejames01: maw is so bad
[2:45:37] MrKhanes: Im actually trying out GW2 right now instead of playing WoW. Quite fun so far :)
[2:45:47] Blah206: loool
[2:45:50] pakapasiti: good ole playoff p
[2:45:58] Thdlock: the only thing i liked about the maw was breaking it
[2:46:01] Shallo1988: @pakapasiti pg 13%
[2:46:06] Thdlock: that zone is LUL
[2:46:22] kokochris: For sure, I will. Probably headback to slow gearing in TBC

[2:46:48] MickyFresc: another aspect is people crave new and interesting content and when they've played wow for years it can feel like all the same, but new games give you that feeling you want which is why people switch to those. but how long they can last who knows
[2:47:12] Couldbet: yea 3
[2:47:14] Thdlock: 7.2 is coming out right around im psure or tomb cant remember
[2:47:27] Bakuryuha96: Bakuryuha96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! 68 months towHAMUP
[2:47:30] sigilla_: Will there be a 9.3?
[2:47:37] submotion: torghast was literally the only new thing they announced this expansions, how were people ever hyped for it? it was obv it would be the new visions
[2:47:37] kokochris: @themcfresh its honestly due to the long patch cycle this time. I hope they can learn from this.
[2:48:01] PidiaP: All of WoD came out in just 3 more days then this patch KEK
[2:48:12] DecayedmiNt: @kokochris Learn from what?
[2:48:27] MickyFresc: @kokochris exactly, the content that's there is really good (imo, as a newer player returning since cata) but it's just taken so long that people have lost interest
[2:48:28] Mecabeast: I'm swapping from dk to warrior for 9.1
[2:48:34] Si1entEch0: Si1entEch0 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:48:34] Blah206: When you say 7 month content drought it negates that the expansion itself has a month or two of content. And why doesn't Blizzard get a covid pass? It seems everyone else does
[2:48:43] desmo7: like swtor?
[2:49:01] meta_mind2: @Towelliee what new specs did you get for your PC?
[2:49:10] MickyFresc: @Blah206 people claim other companies have been pushing out content regardless of covid, but i don't know to what extent that's true
[2:49:15] DecayedmiNt: @ptz117 Not as efficiently, no.
[2:49:18] IndistusX: Cdew mainly excited for the new honor talents
[2:49:31] MickyFresc: @ptz117 they are, how do you think we have 9.1? it just means it's vastly slower
[2:49:31] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:49:39] Si1entEch0: what's the add on in the top left that shows buffs with timers?
[2:49:57] Schnubbers: it is not
[2:50:11] Kinghorn: pally power Si1entEch0
[2:50:18] DecayedmiNt: Ion flat out admitted that Covid affected them development wise
[2:50:29] mavericks312: e3 alone showed us how much covid hurt gaming this last year
[2:50:31] zebajin: IF poE can launch a "patch" every 3 months wow should be able to do it every 6
[2:50:41] MickyFresc: @Synthetiktek of course it did lmao. it's affected everyone
[2:50:43] Si1entEch0: @kinghorn thanks
[2:50:46] desmo7: e3 has been shit for years tho no?
[2:50:59] CardinalTX: ESO got content out. But it has a snit load of bugs and the game gets laggy as hell
[2:51:00] Amnesiac2170: poe is often buggy
[2:51:21] belaham: POE launch of the latest patch was a shit show
[2:51:21] gravlaxxx: @zebajin POE dont work from home. NZ is mainly covid free
[2:51:34] MickyFresc: yeah it's like my company we never worked from home and had to learn it entirely from scratch, maybe a similar thing there
[2:51:47] belfastcl: @SixFourBoom eso is kinda like that though, regardless of covid
[2:51:49] Thdlock: unless tehy delay it and make it a 3 year xpac its very much only 9.2
[2:51:51] motorboatingpro: didn't california send everyone non- esseitial home for like 4 months, before they even got to work from home though?
[2:51:59] Pig1et: @Towelliee Heya Towelliee - I'm a returning player to TBC/WoW. I stopped playing shortly after TBC at release so basically the entire game is new to me. I started a BElf Ret pally to level and then plan on switching to holy for raiding, though I dont have a whole lot of free time being a new dad. Is this viable? How much time would I need to "casually" raid on classic? Do you have any general advice? Thanks in advance.
[2:52:02] Demygoon: how do you think ele shammy will be in 9.1 necro ??
[2:52:02] CMack_72: Patch 9.2: Player housing in the Maw
[2:52:07] Blah206: I'm okay with 2 patches and letting SL share a WoD fate if it means a better 10.0
[2:52:07] CheezusMang: @Towelliee My wife works for Bungie, they've had similar challenges with content updates
[2:52:10] CardinalTX: @belfastcl Big true
[2:52:20] MickyFresc: i really wouldn't mind them delaying the next expansion and staying longer in SL. totally fine with me
[2:52:39] idenkaz_: filler exp
[2:52:46] dracullus: @Towelliee what window? WoW sells great no matter if it's August or November
[2:52:56] Colt_Engineer: I just want my Legion classic now
[2:52:58] HandoEZ: fired too many devs trying to save costs, didnt they announce they were hiring 2000 more
[2:52:59] desmo7: you know what that means then, the next xpac will be sick
[2:53:07] MickyFresc: @dracullus he means investors are expecting a certain schedule
[2:53:11] magemaster225: you think next xpac is gonna be a new class xpac
[2:53:14] mantistabogg1n: Are you playing in 9.1 or mainly sticking to TBC
[2:53:20] Amnesiac2170: 110MM to CEO can't produce content kek
[2:53:22] venom366: time to hit em with the flex Kappa
[2:53:24] Kinghorn: towRF
[2:53:32] MickyFresc: @HandoEZ did they actually fire devs or was that just what people assumed?
[2:53:38] Pig1et: if anyone else has advice im all ears and appreciate it
[2:53:43] Blah206: I just want 10.0 to not be rushed. We've anticipated it for so long. Shadowlands wasn't quite the Legion exp we were hoping for.
[2:54:40] Masqerader: ugh, these run backs lol
[2:54:43] Pig1et: @Towelliee Heya Towelliee - I'm a returning player to TBC/WoW. I stopped playing shortly after TBC at release so basically the entire game is new to me. I started a BElf Ret pally to level and then plan on switching to holy for raiding, though I dont have a whole lot of free time being a new dad. Is this viable? How much time would I need to "casually" raid on classic? Do you have any general advice? Thanks in advance.
[2:54:45] Pig1et: sorry to spam
[2:54:46] DecayedmiNt: Best thing for Shadowlands so far for me has been that Nvidia finally patched the damn flickering
[2:54:51] evad1971: hate this corpse run
[2:55:04] Blah206: @Synthetiktek hell yeah
[2:55:12] Blah206: loool big true
[2:55:13] MickyFresc: 100% correct. people can't be happy with anything no matter what
[2:55:16] Blah206: ahahaha

[2:55:17] dracullus: @themcfresh well if SL will be exactly as long as BfA, next expac would come spring '23, I don't buy that inverstors force devs to release before end of 22 if they already "allowed" longer expacs
[2:55:18] MickyFresc: it's insane
[2:55:19] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[2:55:33] MistaHat: i just care about the content that is in it lol \
[2:55:34] doublemeatpalace: its because when they take forever the patch is still shit
[2:55:41] GrizlyInsertion: I am happy, but thats me, lol.
[2:55:44] dracullus: @Towelliee even skybox will be black just for doomsayers
[2:55:55] venom366: stop rushing things DansGame
[2:55:56] daegoh: i think its bellular that made every so salty
[2:56:04] S1appadabass: its the least rushed patch in wow's existence
[2:56:07] kingmo2249: Haha so true
[2:56:12] Marywanna: You can never really judge a patch until you've spent a few weeks in it.
[2:56:13] mantistabogg1n: Shoot me for any more time in Nathria
[2:56:13] Diabeates: this is the quickest soon we've had
[2:56:14] Masqerader: 3 schools of thought for patches now. It's actually rushed/taking to long and WOW is dead
[2:56:14] doublemeatpalace: I don't think they're saying its rushed. its that its taken this long and still looks unfinished
[2:56:20] DecayedmiNt: He wants it to be Ashes of Creation cycle Kappa
[2:56:27] evad1971: too many ppl listening to Asmon
[2:56:30] idenkaz_: @daegoh he doesn't have the range in he big picture of things he is irrelevant
[2:56:34] MickyFresc: @dracullus idk about forcing, but there's def pressure on blizzard from their investors i would imagine. but then again im just being cynical, maybe they're all fine with whatever schedule blizzard creates for themselves
[2:56:40] Blah206: I don't mind longer waits if the patches are worth it. I want timeless isle/throne of thunder style patches
[2:56:48] Sonatta: are there any examples from the PTR showing the patch isn't ready?
[2:57:00] dracullus: @daegoh imo salty ex WoW players that can't go on just stack up and we have more of them every year
[2:57:02] Masqerader: Towelliee gonna get another weapon token off, just to stick it to his guild once again
[2:57:12] Blah206: ego andy
[2:57:34] fearlessfungi: bad systems =/= unfinished
[2:57:36] MistaHat: their opinion. Their opinion is unfinished
[2:57:39] MickyFresc: "everything" - the pepega wow community
[2:57:43] Fugazi811: conduit energy system has to be one of the dumbest things implemented
[2:57:51] Yagr6: does the ilvl go up next week or raid week?
[2:57:57] BlueBeast33: Class tuning is the only thing I can think of...but that never ends anyway
[2:58:00] mantistabogg1n: Their spec isn’t meta yet so it’s unfinished
[2:58:04] MickyFresc: @Fugazi811 it is dumb but to think it's this major gamebreaking issue is insane
[2:58:15] DecayedmiNt: @Fugazi811 6.1 patch wants a word. But yeah, it's dumb.
[2:58:29] cabalish: is ur new pc running well ?
[2:58:30] Ballavar: Ballavar is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Towelliee! 
[2:58:40] MickyFresc: @BlueBeast33 explain how you can balance classes for all of time? that's entirely impossible for them to do
[2:58:42] dryco000: which Scrolling Combat do u use?
[2:58:50] dracullus: class tuning is finished when my spec is OP
[2:59:01] Schnubbers: so oyu dont think that there was supposed to be more content
[2:59:08] Schnubbers: because that seems very barebone
[2:59:12] DecayedmiNt: In 9.1? No
[2:59:13] hrdstylem: fire mage still nerfed patch is unfinished xd
[2:59:20] Blah206: My height is unfinished
[2:59:23] Schnubbers: yes
[2:59:25] CrowCommando: nope
[2:59:26] CardinalTX: Everyone cant be #1 on the meters
[2:59:26] Amnesiac2170: nope
[2:59:27] memnon94: people say its unfinished cuz they dont like whats in the patch, like oh my class didnt get a buff, its unfinished
[2:59:27] mikejames01: This game going down the tube worse thand wod
[2:59:34] Masqerader: the people who think patch 9.1 is unfinished, are the same dumb fucks who keep saying "content is forced, and not a choice" when everything you do in a game is a choice lol
[2:59:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:59:43] Bakuryuha96: No one would have said anything if everything was normal
[2:59:45] mikejames01: NOT true
[2:59:50] doublemeatpalace: because we would be near ready for a 2nd patch pretty soon
[2:59:52] Ballavar: na, but now im set into classic like i never had been before. i am kinda havin a hard time to tink about playin retail
[2:59:52] Fugazi811: torghast the major let down so far of SL, hope it improves
[2:59:54] Yordie_Sanders: 10000%
[2:59:54] Blah206: tell them the truth Towel
[3:00:02] doublemeatpalace: we're getting like almost half the content imo
[3:00:04] Blah206: mhm
[3:00:05] GTmask: LUL
[3:00:09] mavericks312: speaking nothing but facts
[3:00:10] mikejames01: not true i think we would of cried more
[3:00:11] Kinghorn: LUL
[3:00:13] Schnubbers: so you telling me in comparison to legion or bfa we would be fine if there was no delay
[3:00:16] Schnubbers: cause i sure dont think so
[3:00:17] Ballavar: would have been the same content - just quicker
[3:00:22] mikejames01: this is worse than wod
[3:00:28] Kinghorn: any greeders
[3:00:36] Mecabeast: woo woo chuga chuga chuga
[3:00:38] BlueBeast33: @themcfresh Not sure what you mean. I was just trying to think of a reason for people's excuses as to why they think the patch is somehow being "rushed." Class balance is always an ongoing process, it's never gonna be perfect.
[3:00:39] Masqerader: Only person who would have been mad if 9.1 was on a regular schedule and still complaining is that dunce belluar
[3:00:39] magemaster225: do an AH scan for your tooltips sake
[3:00:40] jasperboy: 9.1 is being rushed reeeeeee
[3:00:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: if we would have been flying 4 months after expansion launch it would be pretty hard to complain about that
[3:00:50] CrowCommando: LUL
[3:01:32] mikejames01: I see why everyone is going to FF online

[3:03:33] Ballavar: same for legion and suramar/nighthold
[3:03:38] Bakuryuha96: Without covid. 9.1 would have been fine most likely
[3:03:39] dracullus: people really need explaining we never got new zone in X.1 patch?
[3:03:48] doublemeatpalace: It is one thing to say balance is never totally complete. But if you release a system or abilities and within a week or two have to nerf stuff by like 50-100%. It was no ready.
[3:03:57] Colt_Engineer: @Ballavar an illussion...what're you hiding?
[3:04:15] MickyFresc: @dracullus we have korthia FeelsGoodMan

[3:05:00] ArcaneSyntax: I seriously think some wow players should probably consider the pandemic more seriously than they have been.
[3:05:10] Ballavar: man i miss suramar, i wanna buy a house there @Colt_Engineer
[3:05:20] Ballavar: but i got to many illusions to hide

[3:06:02] doublemeatpalace: I don't think its just people not considering pandemic enough but blizz has ruined a lot of their good faith anymore
[3:06:20] Blah206: Diablo 4 will save us

[3:06:30] bantuatha: Druid leveling?
[3:06:49] ArcaneSyntax: I think the community has ruined their good faith in Blizzard, they've been pretty open about a bunch of stuff, it's content creators stirring the pot and getting people mad.
[3:07:01] Blah206: Bellular ^^
[3:07:11] bantuatha: Bellular?
[3:07:21] bantuatha: Wait that WoW news guy?
[3:07:24] doublemeatpalace: You thik blizz has been pretty open? They're horrendous at communicating anything, lol.
[3:07:35] MickyFresc: yeah bellular's youtube has been a shitshow lol
[3:07:43] MickyFresc: the clips channel that is
[3:07:56] Tomolitic: I like Bellular
[3:08:00] Yordie_Sanders: I think the communities Expectations ruined their good faith. so many years of wanting more and being upset blizz didnt give them stuff they didnt even say they would.
[3:08:04] Blah206: LOOOL
[3:08:06] Mecabeast: I can't be mad at content creators that do that. everyone needs money and they were smart and charismatic enough to get paid for it.
[3:08:13] Blah206: LUL LUL
[3:08:13] mavericks312: I think it's the other way around the community has ruined the good faith in blizzard especially ppl like bellular
[3:08:15] Blah206: SAY IT HOW IT IS
[3:08:17] bantuatha: He is starting shitting on WoW and praise more on FF Online stuff?

[3:08:26] Colt_Engineer: bro I used to love watching his legion videos now I can't stand his shittting on wow
[3:08:27] MickyFresc: @bantuatha in a nutshell yes
[3:08:29] Amnesiac2170: his channel is lore
[3:08:30] Ballavar: bellular atleast is forward with his obvious shill ness
[3:08:41] Sonatta: Spicy pull
[3:08:51] MickyFresc: @Ballavar shilling for whom? he's super critical of blizzard right now what do you mean
[3:09:10] bantuatha: At the very least 9.1 is coming out
[3:09:12] doublemeatpalace: I mean, he still has to make wow content, kind of what his channels is around.
[3:09:18] othii: Have you got a warrior tank too?
[3:09:28] bantuatha: Hopefully he will change his mind
[3:09:40] Ballavar: @themcfresh himself - just clickbait is what i mean
[3:10:06] submotion: isnt most wow streamers their content to shit on wow?
[3:10:07] Amnesiac2170: he shits on gameplay not the lore
[3:10:10] MickyFresc: yeah seems very doubletongued
[3:10:12] Blah206: He wants to honey-dick both audiences
[3:10:12] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:10:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: drama = money
[3:10:20] PP_W_22Cm: Those people watch Asmon as he calls the game dog shit
[3:10:22] boguspoopis: Are you saying that people aren't allowed to be critical of the games they love?
[3:10:27] dracullus: @Towelliee I saw content creators shiting on BC mount and then buying or using code for deluxe edition
[3:10:27] bantuatha: Well after what we will find out on the next major update of Shadowlands and phase 2 of TBC
[3:10:28] TheUnknowing: I will never take belullar seriously
[3:10:30] conath2: i tryed wow trial til lvl 20 to see if i like it but glad i didn't resubb the game is boring and looks empty
[3:10:33] mavericks312: at this point he is sitting on it just to shit on it cause it's the popular thing to do
[3:10:40] Naturalbeef: Maybe he should go work on his game that's never coming out
[3:10:59] LordMorrowbringer: @Towelliee Okay but from the other hand, playing something for sentiment alone and coping with increasing abuse of player base with systems that were disliked in beta isnt a solution either.
[3:11:03] Blah206: lol
[3:11:03] Sonatta: LUL
[3:11:07] MickyFresc: @conath40 to be fair you barely played it at all but if you hated every second of that, maybe it isn't for you yeah. but thinking the game is empty at level 20 is insane
[3:11:16] epiczplz: I love dropping into the stream and hear towelliee spit the truth
[3:11:23] belfastcl: I think if one thinks the game is shit, the reasonable thing to do is quit, but content creators have additional incentives to stay
[3:11:25] doublemeatpalace: I mean, some of it is prolly just an addiction thing to thie point too.
[3:11:31] TomSkerritt: TomSkerritt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[3:11:31] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Supercool cutscene happens and then it goes this game is dogshit Kappa
[3:11:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: drink pepsi max Kappa
[3:11:38] conath2: i played wow for 15 years im playing other games now @themcfresh but i do watch wow streams
[3:11:38] Ramzilla92: WoW cant be bad in your opinion...
[3:11:45] Blah206: @conath40 You use trial and level 20 but you also use "re-sub" lol
[3:11:46] dracullus: "IS THIS END OF WOW??" i'M cRiTiCaL aNd ResPonSiBlE CuStoMeR
[3:11:54] doublemeatpalace: I mean, he's been pretty detailed on his criticisms
[3:11:56] conath2: nope i didnt resubbed
[3:11:59] Blah206: oh you went back and tried it out gotcha
[3:12:00] TomSkerritt: towHAMUP
[3:12:01] kokochris: cant stop wont stop...
[3:12:01] Mecabeast: plays for 1000hrs reports game is dog shit, continues to 0lay game for another 3k hrs.
[3:12:03] conath2: i know what i do and i wont resubb ever
[3:12:12] conath2: the game is boring but i like to watch wow streamsa
[3:12:14] MickyFresc: @conath40 i'm just saying you can't say there isn't content when you haven't done it
[3:12:28] conath2: maybe there is but its just boring the game it self
[3:12:36] belfastcl: he won't
[3:12:44] doublemeatpalace: @Mecabeast that would be why its an addiction and its baked into habit. Its not always easy to break.
[3:12:54] Sonatta: AoC being successful LUL
[3:13:00] TomSkerritt: !video
[3:13:05] MickyFresc: well he was saying good mmos as a genre are very rare so he's feeling forced to move on
[3:13:08] conath2: im playing atm singleplayer games somemario kart 8 on switch retro games like that more then wow
[3:13:19] boguspoopis: If the only people who made content for a game were ones who were positive of it then the game would never progress for the better, you need voices in communities that voice multiple perspectives and veiws
[3:13:24] CardinalTX: Dude im quitting mmos tomorrow, ya, tomorrow
[3:13:30] MickyFresc: @conath40 happy for you, i think people should always play what they enjoy so there you go
[3:13:32] Mister_Ript: My problem with MMO's in the last 5-10 years is that they literally all look the exact fucking same. Black Desert, AoC, and FFXIV all look the same. Their trailers are the same. Everything is so similar, what differentiates??
[3:13:40] Mecabeast: @doublemeatpalace agree not everyone can find a suitable hobby as a replacement.
[3:13:44] conath2: i watch streamers playing this boring game instead of me resubbing to it each time lol
[3:13:50] Blah206: Former WoW players are the worst lol. But I don't blame them, they usually feel pressured or forced to play or hear about the game. And the biggest haters are perturbed by WoW's resilient relevance
[3:14:03] TheTieThatBinds: to be honest, blizzard is a shadow of its former self. Activision is actively running wow into the ground.
[3:14:17] conath2: ye that is true and i try wow evryonce in a while @themcfresh but when ever im in wow i lose intrested in the game that is why i dont enable the sub
[3:14:17] Moobot: Don't forget that every month you get a free Twitch Sub with Amazon Prime! towSellout Step 1 - twitch.amazon.com/prime Step 2 - Hit Subscribe on my channel page and HIT THIS BUTTON BABY i.imgur.com/XCoETwY.png towPog
[3:14:20] MickyFresc: @conath40 so you feel compelled to watch streamers play this 'boring' content but somehow still claim it's boring.. interesting
[3:14:23] Blah206: That's true, but who is doing it better? y'kno
[3:14:30] bantuatha: WoW series will end when the entire world is destoryed
[3:14:32] conath2: so i dont have to play this garbage game ye
[3:14:33] Yordie_Sanders: calling a game dogshit and bad isnt critcism thoough, its just being salty. there is a huge difference between a "tis game is dogshit" video and "this is whats wrong with the patch" video
[3:14:38] conath2: i watch streamers play it instead
[3:14:40] MickyFresc: @TheTieThatBinds activision has almost no affect on blizzard's content
[3:14:53] mikejames01: @conath40 it is not garbage then why in the hell watch it lol makes no sense
[3:14:54] TheTieThatBinds: @themcfresh if you believe that, then I have a few bridges to sell you...
[3:14:55] conath2: i could sub now but its a waste of money if i dont play the game
[3:14:56] Murry07: Murry07 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:14:57] Blah206: @themcfresh well I think that is a little naive lol
[3:15:07] Schnubbers: I mean what could be the reason that wow isnt praised as the god game anymore? Even before the draught people werent as happy
[3:15:09] conath2: i like wathching wow streams but i dont like wow self it anymore
[3:15:16] MickyFresc: blizzard has said on numerous occasions they have a ton of freedom over what they do
[3:15:18] conath2: to play it my self

[3:15:52] TheTieThatBinds: @themcfresh its why they lost almost 100% of all the original wow devs, because they have complete freedom lol. right...
[3:15:53] Blah206: mmo wars are as toxic and draining as console wars or Steam vs Epic
[3:15:53] inteus82: who r we flaming?
[3:15:58] zodd_amhai: he is very toxic
[3:15:58] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[3:16:01] MrGattz: do you though?
[3:16:03] Blah206: @inteus82 flaming? no one
[3:16:05] Frank4LuLz: RIP HEELs
[3:16:18] Sonatta: Final Fantasy 14 players don't watch FF14 content, they're in game playing
[3:16:18] BRUTALIT0PS: Do we have to?
[3:16:20] dracullus: @Towelliee I don't mind how The Sun makes money, doesn't mean I respect them
[3:16:24] bantuatha: He's been stuck with WoW for YEARS
[3:16:27] inteus82: @Blah206 ok then who are we talking about ?
[3:16:31] doublemeatpalace: If you think Bellular has only called the game dogshit without giving legit criticism you're not being geniune.

[3:16:43] Mister_Ript: My problem with MMO's in the last 5-10 years is that they literally all look the exact fucking same. Black Desert, AoC, and FFXIV all look the same. Their trailers are the same. Everything is so similar, what differentiates?? :/
[3:16:44] MickyFresc: @TheTieThatBinds ??? lots of devs are still there, ion has been there since like what, tbc i think? activision doesn't tell blizzard to fire older devs lmao
[3:16:46] Blah206: FF doesn't get any views on Twitch
[3:16:55] Amnesiac2170: double is correct
[3:17:00] Blah206: @rip_ript why you keep copy pasta
[3:17:03] bantuatha: I mean the COVID happened, that effects on Blizzard doing slow work at home back then
[3:17:18] TheTieThatBinds: @themcfresh again, if you believe that, I have a few bridges to sell you...
[3:17:20] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace it's very obvious most of his clips channel content is for clickbait
[3:17:33] ch0ller: distract?
[3:17:42] Samthius: What about Asmon? he's about to jump over to FF too^^
[3:17:45] bantuatha: With makes Bellular gone full red of steaming anger and start reeeeingg at Blizzard for doing slow work
[3:17:46] MickyFresc: @TheTieThatBinds by all means. i would rather believe the direct word of the game developer than some rando on twitch :)
[3:17:59] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh that' doesn't mean he doesn't have good points lol
[3:18:02] Mister_Ript: Asmon agreed to play FFXIV for like... a week lol
[3:18:07] xxxpleblordxxx: I'm still waiting for dance studio, boob slider, and Farahlon in WoD
[3:18:14] bantuatha: HOWEVER Blizzard always listen to WoW community
[3:18:21] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i think some of his points are valid, and some are not and he doesn't engage with the full picture
[3:18:48] abbotatoes: I miss wildstar
[3:18:56] mikejames01: @bantuatha lololol
[3:18:56] Blah206: @abbotatoes damn the one that got away
[3:18:57] Drostep: As a warlock I love pally tanks and with a mage it’s wonderful
[3:18:58] bantuatha: @xxxpleblordxxx Farahlon is never going to reveal unless we go back that alt world with Yerel going full light purge
[3:19:12] josh8555: I've been playing FF till 9.1 release

[3:19:18] abbotatoes: @Blah206 Indeed
[3:19:25] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh I think he doesn't a pretty good job of it. But trying to say he's only clickbait calls game dogshit without giving reason is just wrong.
[3:19:49] shpintle: what game are you guys talking about ?
[3:19:51] doublemeatpalace: does*
[3:19:54] Ballavar: ive been enjoying flying combat for some time
[3:19:58] Blah206: What about New World and Ashes
[3:20:00] Yordie_Sanders: FK farahlon we got twitter instead Kappa
[3:20:01] Drostep: Lmfao NotLikeThis
[3:20:03] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i'm saying the reasons he has are not entirely accurate
[3:20:15] Drostep: On the wrath box it said dance studio
[3:20:15] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:20:21] Mister_Ript: Asmon is the best chance FFXIV has lol
[3:20:25] TheTieThatBinds: @themcfresh "direct word of the game developer" you mean the dozens that left blizzard? I think you're just drinking the blizz koolaid. you can like something, and still call out their bullshit, but when they actively get rid of devs for fighting for the supposed freedom they supposed to have...yeah...
[3:20:26] Blah206: all sponsored streams xD
[3:20:30] sinlesssinner: well a lot of ppl are playing all of a sudden now for some extra moneys :)
[3:20:54] CADZtv: yh shroud said he didnt enjoy it
[3:20:55] Drostep: Annie Fusch has been playing before the wow patch
[3:20:57] Yordie_Sanders: WoW just needs a Yoshi P to come save us all
[3:20:59] ShinoaKurisu: shroud said he wont play it, its not graphically appealing to him
[3:21:04] sinlesssinner: oh yea @Towelliee for sure
[3:21:06] SSD511_: So much trolls and talk shit about FF in asmon chat LUL
[3:21:08] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh like what? Most of it is just opinion based
[3:21:08] bantuatha: Is weird that training dummy are still attackable
[3:21:09] Drostep: Looks ok Not my cup of tea
[3:21:20] Technogre: doesn't like ninja play final fantasy?
[3:21:22] Drostep: Remember Tera back in the day
[3:21:23] DocsMistake: I mean fuck the haters, ill keep playing it because i like it
[3:21:26] Roaringkittylol: Asmon
[3:21:29] Yagr6: asmon
[3:21:33] doublemeatpalace: People are playing it cause they're being paid to play it atm
[3:21:33] Watts__: I just leveled a rogue to 36 in FF14 and doood it’s slow. So much dialogue. I just want to kill mobs
[3:21:35] bantuatha: Asmon?
[3:21:35] sinlesssinner: to be frank, NO ONE can i think. If it was going to be a top streaming game it would have done that on its own merrits i think
[3:21:36] dracullus: @Towelliee many forget that starting mmo and playing mmo long term are two separate things, it's easy to like fresh mmo
[3:21:36] BRUTALIT0PS: I would try it, if I had time to even play it. I haven't even had time to hit 70 in bc yet, let alone play another game LUL
[3:21:39] Frank4LuLz: July 3rd
[3:21:39] Mister_Ript: Ninja is a joke. I donno how he still has a following. Spastic, toxic child.
[3:21:46] Drostep: Off Asmon just watches YouTube’s he won’t play lol
[3:21:50] zaduzodamazu: asmon gona paly on 3rd
[3:21:50] CADZtv: i dont think ninja likes ffxiv he plays the old final fantasy
[3:21:51] bue8: Asmon will play 1 day and leave lol
[3:21:52] Roaringkittylol: No, its too weeb for him lol
[3:21:55] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS u have time u just succ
[3:21:58] bantuatha: he is going to play FF online on July 3rd for charity
[3:21:58] Yagr6: did some one say asmongold?
[3:22:00] Mister_Ript: Asmon agreed to start playing FFXIV on July 3rd as a part of his Charity Stream, yesterday.
[3:22:04] Blah206: yup
[3:22:07] Yordie_Sanders: @rip_ript pretty easy to keep a following when youve been streaming since justin.tv
[3:22:09] SSD511_: True
[3:22:12] MickyFresc: @TheTieThatBinds no i'm talking about Ion/Steve/etc that we've had interviews with, they all say they have the freedom they would want to develop the game as they see fit. what makes you think they're actively getting rid of good devs?
[3:22:13] sinlesssinner: it ll be a flavor of the day/week thing, as usual
[3:22:17] NinjaGlovz: Asmon will give up after 6hours when he plays it on July 3rd
[3:22:17] BRUTALIT0PS: No I don't. I am about to take Gavin to yet another doctor appointment here in a few minutes
[3:22:21] koko316: He set a date July 3rd
[3:22:23] Nyrocxx: July 3rd
[3:22:28] bantuatha: @Towelliee the raid won't open until July 6th
[3:22:28] sinlesssinner: FF cant beat WoWs combat system, its just too slow for kids these days
[3:22:28] Blah206: but they want to keep sending us those google trends and ff sub numbers
[3:22:28] Lifestream7: Think he said july 3rd, it was part of hsi charity stream to set a date at 300k dollars
[3:22:35] ElDrakenMan: asmon doesnt even play retail, he just mount farms
[3:22:35] inteus82: FF just got alot of hype. bellu is just a drama sucker
[3:22:37] bue8: FF is a casual game
[3:22:38] TheTieThatBinds: @themcfresh mike morheim
[3:22:38] SlowMoJoe_TV: I love ffxiv. It’s just not a great game to watch.
[3:22:42] MrGattz: hey july 3rd is my birthday
[3:22:42] koko316: Saturday
[3:22:44] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace and i think everyone should/can have their opinions, i just disagree with many of his.
[3:22:45] Drostep: Asmon loves wow to much he will never
[3:22:47] Mister_Ript: Reason for the 3rd is he wanted to do the 10th but that's when other content comes out. So he gave it a week lmao
[3:22:53] BRUTALIT0PS: Nice Gattz, mine is July 5th
[3:22:59] BRUTALIT0PS: My daughters is July 6th
[3:23:01] Mister_Ript: He's got a week to fall in love. If it doesn't happen July 3-10, its over.
[3:23:05] MrGattz: @BRUTALIT0PS oh damn cohhPog
[3:23:08] MickyFresc: @TheTieThatBinds you actually think activision wanted him to leave? bruh
[3:23:08] TheTieThatBinds: morhaime*
[3:23:11] SSD511_: I believe he will log off after 30 minutes or so like he did with eso
[3:23:19] NinjaGlovz: NinjaGlovz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[3:23:21] bue8: do ppl realy thinks asmon will play more than 2/3 days ?
[3:23:29] Archiee: he can read?
[3:23:33] CADZtv: yh he said he wants to its gnna be hilarious
[3:23:38] Watts__: LUL
[3:23:39] laughing_octopus: ffxiv is lame as shit
[3:23:40] MickyFresc: yeah and people are gonna swarm him in game, it's gonna be mayhem
[3:23:42] Sonatta: the first bunny girl is going to trigger him and he'll be out
[3:23:56] MrGattz: @BRUTALIT0PS we just need someone whos july 4th and we can have like a week long birthday party lol
[3:23:58] Armdel: He'll have a crowd of catgirls chasing him around everywhere driving him mad
[3:24:12] TheTieThatBinds: @themcfresh you think they didn't force him out? lol why do you think he created Dreamhaven? It was specifically to counter the way activision is ruining blizzard. Its also why A LOT of the game devs leaving Acti-blizz go there
[3:24:14] xxxpleblordxxx: Let's be real, he's not gonna play it ... just gonna be him in town clicking accept on trades and surrounded by 100 cat bunny girls
[3:24:27] sinlesssinner: he wont like it, for sure, but he has to give in to the hype for now
[3:24:27] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i think he also blows problems WAY out of proportion
[3:24:33] Gozzy: its a damn better chacne than doing ARR tho
[3:24:34] CADZtv: but he made a good point that people would say that he cant give an opinion about the game cause he boosted @Towelliee
[3:24:45] Blah206: Coming from WoW I felt ARR MQ was long, and sloggy. I bought all the expansions but was burned out by Heavensward. That GCD being a second or two longer is tough. No pvp. You can buy emotes. UI is ugly. <3
[3:24:49] bue8: Bellulargaming : 10 hours in FF14 , FF14 do better than WOW in every way LOL
[3:24:51] sinlesssinner: i am bored of wow rightnow, but i cant do FF, that combat system is garbage
[3:24:59] BubbaChubbs420: some of those 200+ quests in between the expansions are so stupid. I hate it.
[3:24:59] ArcaneSyntax: he's gonna play it, see his viewer count drop like a brick and then stop streaming because of "anxiety".
[3:25:05] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee there is boost for MSQ
[3:25:19] Bakuryuha96: @themcfresh He was at blizzard since it was founded maybe he got bored and wanted to move on. Not everyone wants to spend their whole lives on one thing
[3:25:19] Sonatta: 200 hours of story content to get caught up for the new expansion if you start at level 1
[3:25:31] NinjaGlovz: Between the gating and his chat he'll Gquit in less than 6 hours
[3:25:34] SSD511_: Anniefuchsia will quit FF when wow patch come out because she has 34+ achievements she will hunt all the new mount etc
[3:25:35] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh I'm sure he's being overdramatic on some stuff. But I'm in the same boat thinking wow has done a lot of shit things and makeing the game worse. So maybe he's just frustrated.
[3:25:44] Drostep: That sound boring asf LUL
[3:25:47] Blah206: I will bet he will never get to Shadowbringers. He said he wasn't going to boost. Because he wouldn't hear the end of it if he did.
[3:25:53] MickyFresc: @TheTieThatBinds what's a "lot"? i don't think there's even five that are on his new team. And no I don't buy that they pushed him out at all. I think that was his decision entirely. Mike still being at blizzard would only be good for the company, which makes activision happier
[3:25:53] bue8: dungeons looks so easy , no difficulty
[3:25:58] mikejames01: @themcfresh where do u come up with this lol JUST STOP!!
[3:26:11] Watts__: Yeah why is there so little combat in ff14? I’m at lvl 36 and rarely fighting
[3:26:21] Mockle: sounds horrible
[3:26:23] vimie: basically a tv show?
[3:26:24] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[3:26:27] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee I agree but 9.1 isnt sustainable content past maybe a month? 2?
[3:26:28] CADZtv: yh final community are anal
[3:26:33] Gizimoo86: people want content, when game has content people still complain LUL
[3:26:33] CardinalTX: I liked FF, very good game. All the reading and cut scenes became to much for me. If it was 100% voice acted I could take it
[3:26:37] Drostep: Lol
[3:26:39] CADZtv: kinda annoying
[3:26:47] Drostep: Elitist Kreygasm
[3:26:50] zodd_amhai: the nodding killed me
[3:26:50] cashaga: the fact that wow is 15 years old and still cant be beat as a mmo is sad in way
[3:26:53] DocsMistake: I mean the WoW community is not any better, and in most ways they are worse
[3:26:55] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i mean sure wow has done some bad things, that's gonna happen, i'm not saying the game is perfect lol
[3:26:56] CADZtv: final fault for having a bad pacing on the story
[3:26:57] Archiee: and wow is different how?
[3:26:58] RiptideRush740: i skip all the story stuff in ffxiv. just so much of it
[3:27:04] bue8: On bellular channel , if you critizise FF , They jump at you LUL
[3:27:08] BubbaChubbs420: some of those cut scene are completely unnecessary
[3:27:12] ElDrakenMan: is the rep grind in wow still a slog? I havent played since BFA
[3:27:12] Kauko13: I cant stand FF community, they are full of... act like evryone that plays something else is wrong
[3:27:13] Blah206: the ff community are getting louder as the wow community becomes divided and jaded ex players hate from the outside
[3:27:17] Blah206: a storm is brewing
[3:27:31] mikejames01: and he thinks wow cash shop is bad lol
[3:27:34] laughing_octopus: they call them gcbtw xD
[3:27:40] MickyFresc: @bue8 isn't that true if you criticize FF14 anywhere at any time about anything? like how you can't call out someone's bad dps
[3:27:51] sinlesssinner: @Kauko13 its human nature, everyone acts the same when an outsider comes over to play their game
[3:27:51] thrasnerv: @Towelliee Professions worth leveling in tbc in your oppinion?
[3:27:53] MickyFresc: @drakenPWN not really no
[3:27:54] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh its all opinion. Just a bunch of people think its in a bad state and they keep trying to milk players.
[3:27:56] TriumphantToad: having to recraft my leggo for 9.1 makes me sad :(
[3:27:57] bue8: they want content creator LUL
[3:27:58] Mockle: nah wow players dont love their game, its actually the opposite. It's like a toxis relationship, you just can't leave
[3:28:09] bue8: they don't have interesting content creators OMEGALUL
[3:28:09] sigilla_: I do think wow would benefit in being better with their story . . . They burned all the nazjatar lore for not that much and same with nzoth
[3:28:09] mpmhall: @Towelliee Is it easy to finish heroic Shattered in 45 mins?
[3:28:11] CADZtv: FINAL DAWHSHIT
[3:28:15] Archiee: isn't that more telling of the state of WoW?
[3:28:17] CADZtv: lol
[3:28:18] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace yeah i disagree with the take that they are only trying to milk players. i just don't buy it
[3:28:23] Frank4LuLz: "remember to bring a towel"
[3:28:24] Mikroice: I would rather play TBC then ff14. Cant stand that graphic
[3:28:26] Sonatta: Towelliee plays all the MMOs
[3:28:26] Kulture1: when are you play ff14?
[3:28:35] Tequilawyrm: WoW cash mounts bad? $42 mounts in FF14 btw Kappa
[3:28:38] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[3:28:39] SSD511_: UwU VoHiYo
[3:28:43] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee meh its just because wow is doing bad rn and 9.1 isnt going to help that...
[3:28:55] MickyFresc: yeah that's another thing, FF cash shop is way worse isn't it?
[3:29:01] bue8: @themcfresh i don't know man , FF14 is on LFR difficulty i think if dps dont matter
[3:29:05] Foxdoabarrelrofl: yea the cash shop is real bad
[3:29:05] Blah206: The best was quoting that article that ARR overtook sub numbers when they included trials and divided classic+retail.
[3:29:14] kilowx: final fantasy players have enough delusional to say their game is killing wow,
[3:29:17] Blah206: LOL
[3:29:20] Tequilawyrm: @themcfresh Descsribed "worse". It caters to a different audience
[3:29:22] mabrno: dcarter
[3:29:22] sinlesssinner: again, if it were to ever become more popular than WoW, then it would have already lol again, on its own merrits.
[3:29:23] ch0ller: hey Towelliee you tried FFXIV yet?
[3:29:24] mr3machine: But on reddit there are MILLIONS D:
[3:29:32] MickyFresc: ZeplaHQ i think is the main one who switched right? idk when that happened though
[3:29:33] ElDrakenMan: you guys are locked in and way to invested to leave even if you wanted to
[3:29:33] trickyshot_: Know any world first raiders who switched over? nope
[3:29:35] sinlesssinner: so no FF wont ever be top mmo stream on twitch
[3:29:36] bue8: final fantasy streamers 5k overral LUL
[3:29:43] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @kilowx lol we all know that Blizzard is killing WoW not FF14 lmao
[3:29:58] nheonkitty: yes
[3:30:05] MickyFresc: @Tequilawyrm worse from the perspective of MTX/store mounts/cosmetics/etc being bad
[3:30:09] mr3machine: @Volly true, and people who want more story driven wont switch the other way
[3:30:10] Mecabeast: still haven't done normal shattered halls lol
[3:30:12] Mister_Ript: Hunter makes it easy. Warlock can Rain of Fire to find the assassins too
[3:30:14] temp3st98: I remeber when i bought the ffxiv in 2013 and havent played it since then :P
[3:30:16] sinlesssinner: @drakenPWN thats not it, WoW combat system is just way too good lol FF is slowww af

[3:30:28] Tequilawyrm: @themcfresh There's a lot of stuff on their cash shop and there is little to no pushback from the community yes
[3:30:30] cabalish: towOny itmejpDOGSLIDE towOny
[3:30:32] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh I dunno. They repeatedly put time gates into content that people don't seem to like that is needed for your character. Then finally loosen it up in one of the last patches to try and get people to stay.
[3:30:33] MickyFresc: @bue8 there's like a toxic positivity thing with FF14
[3:30:33] icemanj99: This is just me, but I play FFXIV as well as WoW and I wouldn't want most of the WoW players in FFXIV. They're 2 entirely different types of MMO's.
[3:30:37] SinicalDev: It's funny that FF14 gets a free pass for so many MTX, WoW has like 18 mounts and the stores been around for 11 years
[3:30:39] Tequilawyrm: @themcfresh It's like, $15 for an outfit
[3:31:05] mr3machine: @Volly Exactly! As a Wow fan i welcome competition as well, it can only make Blizzard try harder
[3:31:08] MickyFresc: @Tequilawyrm see so I feel like that wouldn't work with WoW players because many people dislike that sort of thing and believe cool stuff should only come from in-game effort
[3:31:11] mikejames01: FF14 cash will make asmon go crazy lol
[3:31:17] bue8: FF14 has been around for years and suddently became the perfect MMO OMEGALUL
[3:31:27] kilowx: You gonna play the next wave of New world beta? @Towelliee
[3:31:30] TriumphantToad: i love ff14 but how fucking THIRSTY some of the streamers are about it is offputting
[3:31:39] Drostep: Those rogues suck lol
[3:31:40] mpmhall: Is it easy to do the 45 minute time Towelliee?
[3:31:40] SinicalDev: @mikejames01 He doesn't criticise it at all, he was watching a mount video yesterday and didnt criticise $30 mounts once
[3:31:41] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace time gates like what? after a few weeks you can progress as fast as you want
[3:31:57] mikejames01: @SinicalDev wow but yet he trash on wow stor what a ass

[3:31:57] mr3machine: @Towelliee have we discussed the 9.1 legendary stuff yet? Some people are super unhappy
[3:32:02] Ballavar: @themcfresh "after a few weeks"
[3:32:05] ZeusDNA: july 20th
[3:32:19] Yagr6: @Towelliee ilvl goes up next week or raid week?
[3:32:21] Blah206: At the end of the day. We all just want WoW to be better. So I can appreciate the competition. A little pressure is good. They just aren't giving Blizz any good ideas to rip off anymore. No one is really doing anything.
[3:32:27] Sonatta: @bue8 it's not a perfect mmo, it's a final fantasy games with MMO bits... so if you're looking for a game that focuses on the MMO side of the game first it's far from perfect
[3:32:35] Drostep: Until reset
[3:32:36] Tequilawyrm: @mr3machine I have no idea why it bothers people so much. Base soul ash is infinitely available in 9.1. If you need to recraft one it literally takes like 2 runs of torg
[3:32:55] mikejames01: @Tequilawyrm cause torg sucks
[3:33:07] MickyFresc: @Ballavar that's very short in the grand scheme of things... and the purpose is so that people can't just steam ahead of others. for the vast majority of players it's not an issue
[3:33:09] TriumphantToad: @Tequilawyrm you get 5k soul ash in 2 runs???
[3:33:11] mr3machine: @Tequilawyrm I dont get it either, genuinely waiting for someone to explain why fans are having heart attacks and cancelling subs
[3:33:28] LtDanko: If only 4 ppl go in he doesn’t charge.
[3:33:37] mikejames01: cause recraft legos is a dumb thing and TORG sucks bad
[3:33:39] aiinz_93: why is leveling so tedious in tbc classic
[3:33:57] Tequilawyrm: @mikejames01 So do it in a group and just afk if you cant do a 15 minute side activity
[3:33:59] MickyFresc: i think it's because of the mentality that torghast sucks and that's all people can think about. personally i really enjoy it in a group and just treat it like a dungeon
[3:34:02] bue8: People are malding about 9.1 legendaries but i'm pretty sure they don't even have enchants on ring , chest + 15 primary stats OMEGALUL
[3:34:04] TriumphantToad: @Tequilawyrm you get 5k soul ash in 2 runs of torg?
[3:34:17] Kinghorn: it just seems tedious because each level takes so long Ainz_TV
[3:34:18] Tequilawyrm: @TriumphantToad DOn't know the exact amounts but you get more and there's only like 4 floors now
[3:34:22] mikejames01: @Tequilawyrm I am not doing something I HATE and think is lame for the game was abad idea like the maw
[3:34:37] MickyFresc: @TriumphantToad not sure about the exact numbers but you get heavily increased soul ash in 9.1, and can also repeatedly farm for infinite soul ash if you REALLY want to
[3:34:40] mikejames01: nothing you can makes torg good its a bad idea
[3:34:42] Tequilawyrm: @mikejames01 So do you have a real criticism or is it Just "i dont like it"?
[3:34:46] MickyFresc: @TriumphantToad and can also transfer to alts
[3:34:58] mr3machine: @themcfresh me too, I can see people getting bored of course but one char grinding out best leggies was a blast for me and friends

[3:35:09] Recaud: ...Nice.
[3:35:10] MickyFresc: if you understand what they're meant to be
[3:35:17] NiteshadezTV: nice
[3:35:17] TriumphantToad: imo torg is one of the most boring things i've ever done in WoW
[3:35:19] daegoh: if you made torghast 4 floors it would be so much better

[3:35:25] ch0ller: faster because of addons
[3:35:31] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh torghast. Having to farm content twice a week that no one seems to like to get legendaries. Then having to do all the same shit over again on alts. Conduit energy is a time gate for higher level play. Reknown. Making people have to do tyrannical keys in m+ when people have said for years its bad. Like so much is time gated to try and make people sub and play longer instead of making the content better.
[3:35:32] grillinchillin: you went from 1-70 in 69 hours?
[3:35:33] Tequilawyrm: @daegoh That's literally what they're doing
[3:35:37] MickyFresc: @daegoh they are actually making floor 5 the boss so it'll be faster
[3:35:38] TheUnknowing: it definitely felt longer than i thought it would
[3:35:40] bue8: Blizzard should have keep visions instead of torghast
[3:35:47] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, 69 hours is better than the 300 hours it took my shaman in vanilla.
[3:35:58] TriumphantToad: i hope so man, it's just wasted potential, people prolly worked super hard on it too
[3:36:15] LeGoogs: @Towelliee Hair Looking clean, sick new set up too

[3:36:33] noxiiiouse: @Towelliee is retail worth playing i only here it shit right now wich turns me off ?
[3:36:36] Nokterian: twisted corridors also know as most boring corridors i only went to layer 3 and just stopped
[3:36:37] Archiee: Torghast was a failure and now they're just trying to salvage what they can with it
[3:36:42] ForgottnHero21: heroic mech is fastest and easiest
[3:36:44] Kinghorn: underbog
[3:36:45] kryzanowski11: Mech is easy
[3:36:52] Cyntech89: turn around and do Shattered Halls again
[3:36:55] Mecabeast: shadowlabs?
[3:37:07] bue8: they need to adds thing like mail muncher in Torghast
[3:37:39] bue8: torghast is just bland , and you roll everything with no mecanics
[3:37:39] TriumphantToad: i just really hope it's fun, yeah
[3:37:41] Schnubbers: they should have launched torghast with the insane powers like it was in beta? still dont know why it was changed
[3:37:42] Archiee: they forced us to run torghast more than we wanted to in order to get leggos.... that was bullshit
[3:38:09] liiljxxy: i played shadowlands for like 3 weeks then just ended up raid logging because there was nothing to do
[3:38:18] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace you don't have to farm torghast that often if you don't want to, first of all (once you get the legendary you want). I agree on the alt thing but they're fixing that in 9.1. conduit energy is only an issue for like 0.1% of the playerbase, if that. renown limits everyone so that's not an issue. it would suck if people were renown 40 in week 1 because they farmed a lot and other people were renown 2. tyrannical is not an issue for KSM, only for higher keys.

[3:39:37] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh limiting everyone doesn't mean its not a time gate or not an issue. Its throttling content consumption to keep people playing longer instead of people playing longer caus the content is good.
[3:39:39] Hexof: lots of people didnt do torghast in the alpha/beta and are sick of it also
[3:39:51] NinjaGlovz: PepeHands Torghast PepeHands Torghast
[3:39:54] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace I just fundamentally disagree with that opinion
[3:40:12] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Tyrannical is an issue for a lot of people. ONly a small % do higher than 15's
[3:40:13] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i truly don't believe they gated it to "keep people playing"
[3:40:14] Kinghorn: sloot might have closed in on 4 digits in alpha/beta
[3:40:18] Archiee: Sloot was smart though and did 3 chars at once in there lol

[3:40:32] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace no no no im saying tyrannical ONLY matters for higher keys. not for 15s.
[3:40:38] memnon94: I'm ok with Torghast, it just needs more reward
[3:40:48] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace The time gate critique is a double edged sword? People do it too fast and shoot ahead? games shit and there's nothing to do. Time gate it? Boo you're forcing people to sub longer
[3:40:58] ArcaneSyntax: they nerfed the 5 star thing like 3 builds ago
[3:41:02] mr3machine: @memnon94 exactly, torghast isnt perfect, a few tweaks and better rewards and im happy
[3:41:05] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh It still matters for people doing those keys. A lot of people struggle on 15 tyran keys.
[3:41:06] Kinghorn: PogChamp
[3:41:06] Ballavar: Ballavar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months!

[3:41:20] BubbaChubbs420: not playing that LuL
[3:41:20] Nyrocxx: You get 4 stars by just clearing it now, tho ez for everybody to get into the vault
[3:41:27] Renzay83: LUL
[3:41:30] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace if you can't do tyrannical 15 keys why do you deserve KSM though?
[3:41:31] idenkaz_: they dont give a cookie LULW
[3:41:32] mr3machine: @themcfresh hopefully!
[3:41:55] xluckydawgx: Lmao if they delay it again everyone is going to scream
[3:42:05] MickyFresc: @mr3machine just saying based on the changes in 9.1 that they've made. new rewards and the reworks to make it less punishing, and also shorter (floor 5 boss instead of 6), etc
[3:42:17] mavericks312: everyone trying to block ashes
[3:42:24] Yankozoid: Outland dungeon?
[3:42:30] Yankozoid: Shatt
[3:42:32] CADZtv: people might scream but they want as much publicity as possiblt
[3:42:45] Yankozoid: aaah Vanilla - nice
[3:42:55] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh WHo said anything about deserving anything? They made it take almost twice the dungeons to get ksm to get a reskinned mount and nothing extra. People have complained about tyrannical for years and they just doubled down to force people to play it instead of making it better.
[3:43:09] xluckydawgx: No i get it! Im not saying that, but there is defintely people who dont play WoW who are waiting and are going to SCREECH if it delays again
[3:43:09] Drostep: When’s the world first race ?
[3:43:22] dracullus: perfect windows was like last 4 months
[3:43:25] dracullus: window*
[3:43:38] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace That's a really bad faith argument to say "double" the dungeons to get KSM because that's flat out untrue
[3:43:39] Drostep: Limit going to win again sodaC
[3:43:41] Daggerstry: It includes Sylvanas AND Manduin
[3:43:50] xluckydawgx: Im just excited for New Wrold testing and release
[3:44:11] Miguel85NYC: nah im rooting for Blood Legion
[3:44:13] Drostep: Yeah
[3:44:20] Colt_Engineer: until someone has a another sex scandal
[3:44:23] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace now you're the one drinking the kool aid lol. 15 tyrannical is not the issue, 20+ tyrannical is the issue. plus there's all the other m+ changes to make dungeons far easier in 9.1. I do agree the recolor is a bit lazy but then again that's what people get for pvp seasons so idk really
[3:44:27] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm what, its literally almost double. Like 80% more or something. YOu hav eto do 8 fort 15's, then like 8 12/13 tyrannicals. However it works out. Thats pretty close to double lol
[3:45:08] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace You can do 8 20s, or 16 15s
[3:45:11] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace if you're getting KSM you're gonna be doing those dungeons regardless, it being "double" or not doesn't matter
[3:45:22] stallowned: i had a corsair 650d case back in the day and it was prob my fav case. corsair makes quality stuff
[3:45:26] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh 20's are like what 1% of people that do m+? Your using the same argument that you scolded me on about conduit energy.
[3:46:06] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace you're right, I believe tyrannical affix and conduit energy both do not matter much to the majority of the playerbase
[3:46:07] Miguel85NYC: got something to keep the dust off the fans?
[3:46:09] cabalish: pwm controlled , only on high demand
[3:46:35] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Again just because it doesn't matter to the majority doesn't mean it should be there lol
[3:46:38] Mister_Ript: Blood Legion hasn't been relevant since like '08 lol

[3:47:33] Mister_Ript: I mean, they nerfed the shit out of Sire Denathrius because people couldn't figure out how to avoid the red lines on the floor
[3:47:36] beardedbro84: salad tossed
[3:47:38] Daggerstry: Would you not expect a major lore character throughout the history of the game be a major pain in the ass?
[3:47:40] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace You're missing what I'm saying. I'm saying tyrannical does not affect most people, so why are you trying to say it shouldn't be there
[3:47:42] noxiiiouse: is retail worth playing? i only here it shit right now wich turns me off
[3:47:52] Archiee: she can't die if she's already dead.... think 'bout it
[3:48:03] MickyFresc: @noxiiiouse overall yeah I like it a lot
[3:48:05] rusherrusher: @noxiiiouse prob somewhat fun to play at start of content releases
[3:48:10] danimoto10: how so?
[3:48:19] 2MakeMe: oh u played the test realm for 9.1?
[3:48:50] LeGoogs: @Towelliee There going to wait until limit reaches them to fix them so they can give Echo time to catch up.
[3:48:56] Zoludar: Any clue as of yet what dps are looking like?
[3:49:15] Colt_Engineer: @Zoludar they look like dps
[3:49:17] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace I will say I kind of agree that it doesn't make the dungeon much more interesting, I would rather it be something additional to gameplay during bosses, instead of just making the encounter longer
[3:49:27] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh like come one. It was part of the argument on them trying to force people to do content they don't like. And throttling content consumption to try to get people to sub longer. You said blizz doesn't time gate to keep people playing longer. I gave a lot examples not even including maw time gating. I'm not doing this anymore lol.
[3:49:28] cabalish: weekend was lfr
[3:50:00] amasis: im scared for the patch to be broken as hell

[3:50:42] doublemeatpalace: I think sylvannas world first will be fun to watch but you know mythic sylvannas is gonna be bugged to shit.
[3:50:56] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace I don't think any of those systems are meant to keep people playing when they wouldn't otherwise we've had 40 renown for ages and ages, renown is not a gate that keeps people playing. neither is conduit energy, if anything it makes you play less because it restricts you.
[3:51:50] Colt_Engineer: facts
[3:51:55] 2MakeMe: i like how i was waiting for 9.1 to come out, and now it is coming out but right when im on oversea vacation
[3:51:56] Caibo1: if the patch was perfect then lots of people won't have content lol
[3:52:05] denflup: yeah same as tbc

[3:53:27] grizzlyhorn: 900+ ilvl loot first reset
[3:53:50] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Yes you're almost there. You play less in the moment but play longer over time cause its time gated. Instead of getting people to play more because the content is engaging. Throttling content consumption to such a degree is bad design imo. And its meant to get people to stay subbed longer. Its the same thing with 6 month sub packages. Its not meant to get you to play a lot in that time period, they don't care. Its to bait people into subbing for longer than they might normally sub.
[3:53:54] Colt_Engineer: not a patch but probably the funniest shit show was dalaran server people characters deleted or reverting back to wrath of the litch king characters
[3:53:57] 2MakeMe: oh i remember i had a 15 shrine with m+ started
[3:54:11] Masqerader: You know what I wish they would do with keys in mythic + for SL, instead of having it say PF or TOP it just says the zone. Like the key says bastion on it and u can do either NW or Spires
[3:54:15] 2MakeMe: took 4 hrs
[3:54:33] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace alright man. I clearly can't convince you otherwise. We just disagree on this and that's OK.
[3:54:48] 2MakeMe: no i meant that shrine 15
[3:55:00] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace You've failed to prove why that's actually a bad thing

[3:56:20] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm I wasn't trying to prove anything. This was an opinion argument. If anything the huge sub drop offs prove that their current designs for the game have been bad.
[3:56:23] Gizimoo86: yah my guild barely has 70 x 25 for gruul still many leveling

[3:57:02] Caibo1: netherstorm and Nagrand was great for leveling
[3:57:03] MickyFresc: "huge sub dropoffs" is also attributed to the patch duration, not the "time-gatedness"
[3:57:14] Drostep: The one with the tower
[3:57:24] Mecabeast: I dinged 70 working on the arc attunement
[3:57:28] Renzay83: terrokar forest is great too, especially with the 5% exp buff
[3:57:30] ThaOriginalGamester: i got there at the last quarter of 69. it's a lot of gold too ;)
[3:57:40] Drostep: I always finish with Netherstorm and SMV
[3:57:53] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm I mean they had huge drop offs in bfa too. New content always brings more people back. Then they leave cause they start to dislike the game or get bored. lol
[3:57:55] Drostep: Still have a couple group quests in SMV
[3:58:24] Drostep: SMV has Tk and BT attunes
[3:58:33] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace so you just admitted it isn't because of time-gating? lol
[3:59:16] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh What? lmao. Disliking the game can include stuff like not liking time gating etc. I don't understand what you're tyring to do.
[3:59:49] 2MakeMe: tbh i cant wait for blizz to allow more boosts... i have blizz cash to spend for classic
[4:00:09] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace ah so you're including "time gates" in not liking the content, gotcha.
[4:00:14] 2MakeMe: ive lvled up so many alts that i honestly cant lvl anymore
[4:00:43] 2MakeMe: it was fun lvling in bc again, but it was rough

[4:01:38] 2MakeMe: oh yea ive done that too
[4:01:48] Drostep: My loc was 49 got it to 60 in prepatch
[4:02:08] vimie: Yea it's been fun. The zones are just crowded enough too.
[4:02:10] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Yes. I never said it was the sole reason. Being alt unfriendly is another big one. There are several reasons.

[4:02:35] PawgersHC: Hate this boss
[4:02:35] Kinghorn: the curse is from the trash

[4:03:11] JerBoody: Yea I kinda wish they hadn’t offered the free boost, I was all set to go ham leveling my warrior, got to 29 but as soon as the boost was announced I lost motivation to keep level grinding
[4:03:28] 2MakeMe: damn brb 1 of 9 ad
[4:03:42] 2MakeMe: when did they add 4 more ads...
[4:03:42] Drostep: Was so funny no one would invite boosties to dungeon groups lol
[4:03:47] doublemeatpalace: I kind of wish they just started fresh tbc servers where everyone starts at 58 with like 100g or something.
[4:04:01] Drostep: Communal gear LUL
[4:04:14] doctachur: 9 ads , damn
[4:04:32] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace dude SL is extremely alt-friendly, and it's getting even better in 9.1. what are you smoking man? You can literally gear up an alt to like heroic level in like a week or two if you want to
[4:04:38] Drostep: The gear they gave the boosted toons was trash
[4:05:10] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Its more alt friendly than bfa. But its not really alt friendly.
[4:05:13] PvtHudson093: or classic wow tokens
[4:05:18] kokochris: What was their reason not to boost the professions as well with the boosted character in TBC ?
[4:05:21] roflpotamus: imagine being them oof
[4:05:21] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace it's insanely easy to get a solid baseline of gear and then you can do higher level content, and then you have valor from M+ which has the SEASONAL cap which means you can farm a shit ton of it
[4:05:49] Kinghorn: dont know dont care
[4:05:55] PadidinJones: because they loco @Towelliee
[4:06:03] JerBoody: Kinda hard to justify the time sink when I work 48-60 hours a week and have kids I enjoy spending time with though, especially when I was able to pay for deluxe edition boost with millions of gold from mission sitting on characters still sitting in their garrison lol
[4:06:03] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace have you even tried to gear up alts? i feel like you haven't actually experienced this
[4:06:17] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh you realize how much time investment that is? I have like 7 max level toons lol
[4:06:51] jerexify: @JerBoody Are garrison missions still a good source of gold?
[4:06:51] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace my point is the game allows you to do it very easily, the question isn't whether you have time for it
[4:07:01] roflpotamus: idk if I can do 1-60 again lmao
[4:07:16] JerBoody: No that got taken away as soon as legion prepatch hit
[4:07:25] kokochris: @roflpotamus I boosted for tbc; I couldn't do it
[4:07:34] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[4:07:34] Darzetti_: LUL
[4:07:40] roeddogg: LOL
[4:07:40] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Your can get to like 200 ilvl easy/quick. But you're not getting above like 215 ilvl in a week unless you're playing 5+ hours a day.
[4:07:41] Colt_Engineer: panaick
[4:07:43] 2MakeMe: could have boped him lol

[4:08:20] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace that's exactly my point man. 200 is a good baseline for most people

[4:10:37] Ballavar: @noxiiiouse depends on if you have to go get your wallet or not
[4:10:49] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh if your definition of alt friendly is that you can get max level have almost normal raid gear quick. Not including other aspect of the game for why people might want alts. Then we have different definitions of alt friendly.
[4:11:02] JerBoody: @noxiiiouse About 160 hours of /played unless you get aoe carried by soy
[4:11:02] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:11:08] JerBoody: Someone *
[4:11:19] Mister_Ript: AoE Capping is depressing. Pull 15 mobs and only do 104 damage per second to each lol
[4:11:45] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh If you want to raid heroic, do m+, or pvp without friends hard carrying I don't believe the game is alt friendly.
[4:11:47] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace my definition is getting an alt to a somewhat reasonable level of progression quickly, so they can then participate in the end-game systems like raiding/m+/pvp. and for those things, SL is very good for alts
[4:11:52] noxiiiouse: @JerBoody 160 hours wow thats crazy
[4:12:24] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace what are you expecting? to be able to maintain every character you have at the same level for only 10 hours a week? then no, that's not possible. it's also unreasonable, though.
[4:12:40] GTocha20: what are you looking to buy with Lower City exalted?
[4:12:43] JerBoody: Probably significantly longer if you’re not familiar with questing routes and such, also depends a lot on the class you play
[4:12:55] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh I think you should be able to get into the content without months and months of grinding.
[4:13:16] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i'm telling you that you can. i just explained how much catchup there is. it's actually insane man
[4:13:25] HerculesPerkules: People don't really treat Alts as "alts" anymore. They want all characters to somehow have your mains powerlevel with no effort.
[4:13:31] ch0ller: Are you going to do the Rep > Exp method on your next toon in TBC?
[4:13:32] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace The fact that you felt compelled to include the "without friends" part is incredibly telling. I have 4 220+ alts, but you know, I use the "massively multiplayer" part of the MMO
[4:13:38] MickyFresc: @HerculesPerkules i think that's this guy's issue exactly

[4:15:54] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm You're being such a troll. Playing with friends is fun. But it shouldn't be required to get carried. I think there should be better catch ups for alts.
[4:16:22] doublemeatpalace: @JerBoody and the leveling content in SL is pretty bad imo.
[4:16:47] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace I didn't know it was trolling to suggest a player actually use the social part of an mmo to progress their character? doodLUL leefBlank
[4:16:51] D3m0nHunt3r666: you can farm them in the lakes at nagrand
[4:17:05] JerBoody: @ch0ller True but it probably takes longer to do that than to level efficiently and then grind level 70 dungeons
[4:17:32] ch0ller: not as a tank
[4:17:40] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm Using the social aspect of the game is great. That still doesn't mean that there aren't systems in the game that are incredibly unfriendly to alts.

[4:17:41] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace you don't like going through the covenant/zone storylines? i think they're pretty good tbh. and I don't think it requires having lots of high level friends to carry you. it's nice, sure, but not really necessary
[4:17:46] JerBoody: @doublemeatpalace I agree, I haven’t really enjoyed or cared for leveling since wod
[4:18:16] JerBoody: As bad as wod was it did have an awesome leveling experience
[4:18:34] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace we've explained several times how the game actually is very friendly for gearing up alts. some things maybe aren't, but overall it's very easy if you want to commit to a new character
[4:18:58] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh No I don't want to go through the same covenant two or three times. I don't think the story is that good.
[4:19:38] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh And I disagree. I think if you want to do m+ or pvp I think the game is not alt friendly at all.

[4:20:09] JerBoody: Legion and bfa kinda fucked alts imo, they created an expectation of doing things on your main giving power gains to alts which I think is bad for the game
[4:20:48] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace You still never present any real arguments. When you make a point, it helps to provide some kind of evidence. Just saying "i disagree" isn't productive discourse
[4:21:14] Tequilawyrm: @JerBoody the fact i don't have to grind AP for a weapon/necklace instantly makes SL leagues ahead of legion/bfa
[4:21:37] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm These are opinion arguments my dude. How do you not understand that? We both give examples to support our OPINIONS then we decide if we agree or disagree.
[4:22:06] Tequilawyrm: And one side is presenting tangible facts, and the other is saying "i disagree"

[4:22:13] JerBoody: I don’t see how anyone thought they had to grind so in bfa
[4:22:20] doublemeatpalace: Legion fucked alts cause of legos otherwise it wasn't too bad
[4:22:31] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace What is artifact knowledge?
[4:22:35] Garrujak: Imagine how great the game would currently be if all they did was fix Legion systems and add new levels/add back weapon drops
[4:22:37] Aidler: legion amnesia etc. aka nostalgia
[4:22:59] Daddyknut: i remember getting my first legendary from a HC dungeon and my reaction was "wtf?"
[4:23:07] maccaruso: Legion was great from the start. It only stunk if you were trying to level three toons for riading.
[4:23:23] deadman385: Any 9.1 prep @towelliee
[4:23:25] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i mean i agree you should be able to skip the covenant storyline when joining a new covenant IF you've already done it on an alt but I don't think that's a big deal that makes the game super unfriendly for alts. it's a minor thing imo. I don't pvp a whole lot but as I understand it you can set goals and consistently work towards them, and honor is insanely fast to farm. and M+ holy shit you get gear so fast. 2 drops per dungeon, can upgrade with valor, great vault bonus
[4:23:45] Tequilawyrm: @Maccaruso Yeah dude, it was great getting 2 bad legendaries and being forced to level a new character to try at getting bis leggos to be competitive Kappa
[4:23:46] JerBoody: Ap grind In legion was bad until catch up, but it was fine cause everyone was in the same boat. Bfa ap was so passive I never felt like I had to do anything I wasn’t already doing just to get ap
[4:23:48] Kinghorn: discovery
[4:23:48] daniel85mg: grats lol
[4:23:59] DecayedmiNt: Obviously missed all the legendary complaints then. People were livid they were getting bad leggos/wrong specs
[4:24:22] travrevyendk: In legion we had 7.2 by now LUL
[4:24:27] travrevyendk: not even on 9.1 yet
[4:24:34] Desucakes: legion start was horrible for me yeah
[4:24:34] Darzetti_: yea
[4:24:40] Tequilawyrm: What about getting a BiS leggo for a spec you don't play because oyu forgot to change look specs doodLUL
[4:24:40] JerBoody: Other than ap in legion being spec specific that is, that shit sucked so bad the first few months
[4:24:41] Aidler: @themcfresh you should be able to skip that stuff once you have... say the loremaster achivement for the expansion
[4:24:52] helperuwu3: ur title is druid leveling btw
[4:24:53] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh You do realize even with valor and starting with a bigger pool you can farm for you can still only upgrade like 1 or two items ffrom like 200 to 210.
[4:24:57] Knocx: Knocx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months, currently on a 9 month streak! dam yo

[4:25:15] MickyFresc: @Aidler i think having done it once should be enough
[4:25:16] memnon94: voice of an angel
[4:25:27] BlueBeast33: Wish they'd bring back sockets the way they used to be
[4:25:28] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh You'd have to farm so many dungeons to just to minorly upgrade one item, especially a weapon.
[4:25:29] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace that is insanely wrong lmao
[4:25:33] papaherc: damn dat singinig makin me moist
[4:25:58] DecayedmiNt: @travrevyendk Legion also didn't have a pandemic bringing halts world wide. Like the Nano ram shortage, that affected literally everything with a motherboard on it.
[4:26:20] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace the later it goes, the more valor you can farm. and the intent wasn't to upgrade your entire gear from 200 to 220 with valor, it's to fill in missing pieces that are lower, and get higher ilvl gear as drops
[4:26:20] JerBoody: I almost quit in legion cause I got he 2 worst possible leggos on my main but then I leveled a lock and got bis and 3rd bis like a week and a half apart so that was my mainfor the rest of the expansion
[4:26:33] mmzy_: @baleroc1 no. Bfa had too many systems to get gear
[4:26:53] travrevyendk: @Synthetiktek the nano thing sure, but it started 15 months ago. cant use it as an excuse anymore
[4:27:17] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh It was an attempt at a band aide fix cause people complained at the pvp gearing system being better.
[4:27:49] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace it's a very good system imo, that is reminiscent of pvp's conquest which is a good system

[4:28:54] Aidler: @Towelliee agree
[4:28:55] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh Its better than not having it. BUt its stil a bad system that could be far better.
[4:29:00] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace i don't think "band aid fix" is really accurate either though
[4:29:15] ElDrakenMan: "fun"
[4:29:26] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace Do you really believe it would be better for the game if you could guarantee your bis drops?
[4:30:19] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm I think it would be better for the game if you could more easily target the gear you wanted instead of running the same dungeon 50x hopeing for a slight chance of getting the item you want.
[4:30:26] Asonderr: @doublemeatpalace it seems like you just want every grind done in a week and don't want to actual work for any of the gear/content
[4:30:36] MickyFresc: also the great vault is a really good system because you can literally choose exactly what you want
[4:30:37] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee get the mages one its better it gives more SP

[4:31:31] cordawg: I dont think everybody getting a legendary is healthy for a MMO.
[4:31:34] Mecabeast: the amount of people that left groups cause it didn't drop was toxic
[4:31:38] doublemeatpalace: @Asonderr I don't mind an original grind. But I think subsequent ones should be easier. I think it would make the game healthier.

[4:32:43] normysan: When the game is designed around everyone having a legendary then it kind has to be 100%. I think the only good alternative would be some kind of currency. Having low drop chance just makes things even worse.

[4:32:46] Blah206: why does pali need agi
[4:32:47] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm Sure it is. They could let you grind valor in a dungeon to buy a piece of gear from a dungeon vendor. Then use valor to upgrade that piece as you go.
[4:33:04] totallypayingattention: agi gives dodge
[4:33:06] LogiBare: Towe you want Spellpower to legs as prot pall
[4:33:14] Bearded_Entity: whats best professions for a hunter? first time playing a dps class in wow
[4:33:35] rorlore: @normysan no duh
[4:33:39] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace so would dungeons not drop any gear at all then or what?
[4:33:40] LogiBare: Get spellpower my friend
[4:33:54] LogiBare: Ahhh thats fair.. but its added
[4:33:56] LogiBare: threat
[4:33:59] LogiBare: conc damge
[4:34:08] LogiBare: fair enough
[4:34:09] Sp00kyWag0ns: The nether is worrth more than the enchant
[4:34:14] LogiBare: I gotcha
[4:34:16] CritcobainTV: but your paladin numbers with BRRRRRRRR harder with your animated emote Sadge
[4:34:25] CritcobainTV: will brrr*
[4:34:30] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh They could still drop some gear. Maybe you could sell that gear for resource to buy specific gear from a vendor. So unwanted drops aren't wasted.
[4:34:36] kokochris: towSO
[4:34:57] MickyFresc: @doublemeatpalace maybe that would be a good system, maybe not. I don't know

[4:35:31] flowerpower423: towBleedpurple
[4:35:49] jasperboy: 70 gold for leg armor, how nice it is to be a tank
[4:35:54] Asonderr: @doublemeatpalace just being able to buy gear from a vendor takes away the whole excitement of getting a gear drop. idk that sounds super boring

[4:36:22] doublemeatpalace: @themcfresh You can keep some rng but I think you should be able to target gear more. I have a guardian druid and I've ran DoS like 60x and haven't seen the tank trinket. Kind of sucks lol.
[4:36:33] roeddogg: someone was being nice
[4:36:56] doublemeatpalace: @Asonderr I don't think there is much excitement for gear to drop anyway. I think it ends up being more of a relief you don't have to do it anymore when you finally do get it.
[4:37:16] Bearded_Entity: thoughts on best professions for a hunter? first time as a dps in wow
[4:37:25] Asonderr: @doublemeatpalace maybe that's true for you, but not for a lot of people
[4:37:49] LogiBare: Yo Towelliee So I have Adamantine figurine, Figureine of colossus and Moroes lucky pocket watch. What combo would u use?
[4:37:50] MickyFresc: so maybe some kind of system where you indicate with an interface the drop you're "going" for in that dungeon and you have that drop more weighted than other drops for your spec?
[4:37:56] Darzetti_: Engineering
[4:37:58] Kinghorn: engineering maybe
[4:38:03] Mister_Ript: LW or BS. Engineering doesn't make enough with Zapthrottle Mote Extractor to really make it worthwhile for income purpose.
[4:38:04] Blah206: eventually skinning gives you crit
[4:38:10] nimrhen: doesn't engineering have epic guns?
[4:38:17] Yagr6: @Towelliee joined a guild for tbc classic... now i have to tell them i got to focus on 9.1 LUL
[4:38:18] doublemeatpalace: @Asonderr I'd disagree. I think a lot of people end up doing content they don't want to do over long periods instead of being able to target an item then do other content you enjoy more.
[4:38:32] D3m0nHunt3r666: Engi prio then LW
[4:38:32] Darzetti_: @nimrhen guns,ammo and helmet

[4:38:52] jasperboy: @Bearded_Bad_Gamer For personal gains and if u got the time to farm, skinning and LW. if not. just do herb & mining or herb/mining & enchanting
[4:39:13] MickyFresc: @Tequilawyrm yeah i could see that too. it's a hard issue to get right i guess
[4:39:16] laughing_octopus: yes
[4:39:25] laughing_octopus: its the one time keepers
[4:39:26] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm I'd again disagree. A lot of people want to raid or m+ or pvp but they get burned out doing one of the others to get needed gear from gameplay they don't want to do.
[4:39:27] Mister_Ript: Enchanting is for sure the best way to make easy gold.

[4:40:04] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm I don't think the design should be an endless rng carrot on a stick to keep people playing but let people target some gear then do what they want.
[4:40:28] laughing_octopus: yes thats an awesome one

[4:40:42] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace I think you're extremely underestimating the amount of disconnect people have once they have their bis, especially with it being as easy as a system like that would enable
[4:41:10] grillinchillin: @Towelliee what are good professions for pally?
[4:41:42] Asonderr: @Tequilawyrm problem is people don't want to work for anything and just want their bis in a week
[4:41:47] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm It would be easier to target gear it doesn't mean it has to be super fast. I'm not saying people should be able to get their bis in two weeks. Maybe it takes a few months to target all your bis. I dunno. But I think thats better than just a n rng system
[4:41:48] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee what did enchant ur shield with?
[4:41:52] daniel85mg: Thats good cuz my guild hasnt even start raiding
[4:41:57] LogiBare: you think 3 months for p2
[4:42:01] LogiBare: jesus

[4:42:53] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace I mean everythings better than a pure rng system but that type is system is just begging to promote more raid logging via being perfectly geared too quickly
[4:43:03] MrSnekyDino: What's up with 9.1?
[4:43:19] Tequilawyrm: @doublemeatpalace It's akin to the reforging issue. It just makes gear homogenized
[4:43:32] theDirtyon3: imagine living under a rock lol
[4:43:33] LogiBare: 9.1 gunna be so dissapointing
[4:43:58] Tequilawyrm: @ExcellsTv how so
[4:44:16] jasperboy: well, ima go watch some Euro Championship. So, chat! Behave
[4:44:27] doublemeatpalace: @Tequilawyrm I don't think it would be any different then people wanting certain specs or item levels now. People already farm the same certain pieces. It wouldn't be anymore homogenized than what it already is.

[4:58:07] ogipk: 5 months then remake your lego again LUL
[4:58:09] ZabberzTV: so i had an idea to fix legendary problems so what if u get a rune bring it to the runecarver and he's like og you wanna put that on your armor okay "whoosh" and now it has the same amount of slots as normall raid armor (boom fixed)
[4:58:30] manmower: 9.2 on PTR the week after 9.1 released?
[4:58:38] Tequilawyrm: @GeoSourge It's absolutely true. Entitled children complaining they are minorly inconvenienced
[4:58:47] travrevyendk: more like 2 months @manmower
[4:58:48] suppstantial: I haven't played in about 6 months, I can't decide if I want to come back to retail or play TBC and I can't decide what class to play haha
[4:58:51] bantuatha: @manmower I refuse to believe that
[4:58:58] rosstherosstrich: There is only a lego problem for the players. Blizz just wants you to keep playing
[4:59:07] Ralykx: Whats you herbalism up to now?
[4:59:11] manmower: probably need time to get through the raid at least
[4:59:19] Jarlan23: i doubt theyve even started development on 9.2 yet tbh
[4:59:21] manmower: hopefully they don't want until the end of the covenant stories to do PTR
[4:59:26] Jarlan23: probably not that far into makin git
[4:59:27] bantuatha: give it about month or two
[4:59:35] Tequilawyrm: @rosstherosstrich Yeah you're right dude when leggos were in legion blizzard really cared about legendaries for the players Kappa
[4:59:47] Renzay83: what level is your herb?
[4:59:50] akia03: @Jarlan23 they are working on 10.0 already
[4:59:52] chrslp: They prolly started initial work on Wrath Classic

[5:03:20] GrimlicTV: they make promises they dont deliver on anyways LUL
[5:03:20] Wildside1177: For Blizzard a road map would be like pouring gasoline on every fire.
[5:03:22] Ohdies: people are already losing their minds and misinformation is high. I would rather be disappointed by items falling behind but at least we would have visibility
[5:03:22] flebbooo: Farahlon and Thal'dranath LUL

[5:03:43] NyseTanking: on the BOX THO
[5:03:43] Armdel: if there was continous communication along the develop they atleast ease some of the outrage
[5:04:04] Ezekyler: i have a full folder of Blizzard broken promises, i have more screenshots than photos of my family KEKW
[5:04:09] anticensor_: they cant have roadmap because they cant keep the promise or roadmap would be underwhelming with this new blizzard
[5:04:34] anticensor_: thats why tehy stopped blozzcons
[5:04:46] MickyFresc: @anticensor_ ?? covid
[5:04:54] Tequilawyrm: @dulslo imagine being mad over a corporation LUL
[5:05:04] kilowx: blizz suddenly goes "FREE HONGKONG"
[5:05:20] Wildside1177: Too many entitled raging children in the wow community to have any open dialogue like that.
[5:05:42] TriumphantToad: seems partially the fault of streamers and whatever but imo they do some dumb shit that deserves it
[5:05:42] zekobunny: Do you really blizzard cares about dialogue LUL
[5:05:43] MickyFresc: @Wildside1177 you mean fully grown adults ACTING like children
[5:05:53] akia03: wow also has way to many different type of players for that anyway
[5:05:57] Redpandalol: @towelliee it feels like we are shouting into the void
[5:06:03] Wildside1177: @themcfresh Yes I stand corrected. You got it exactly right.
[5:06:10] kilowx: blizz type of company to find a dead guy and take his wallet anyway
[5:06:12] francescothepainter: yo there was this game that was crazy hyped and had a roadmap and big names every where can't remember the name though ..... Cyber smthing
[5:06:35] nimrhen: @PhilleWille you mean star citizen? :D
[5:06:42] Ohdies: that moment when you enjoy the conversation than get smacked with 9 back to back adds lol
[5:06:49] MickyFresc: Cyberpunk i think he meant lol
[5:06:54] PhillyDilly18: Star Trek online does a weekly livestream that sometimes answer questions from fans. I feel so bad for the community manager having to deal with the STO andys. They are rough.
[5:06:57] nimrhen: duh
[5:06:58] MrSlugSnail: gather mate?
[5:07:22] flebbooo: Disaster LUL
[5:07:25] Wildside1177: Star Trek Andies make WoW andies look like reasonable people.

[5:08:20] TheUnknowing: There are still areas mentioned in lore that we havent seen yet @bantuatha
[5:08:22] nimrhen: they'll need someting in november to face ffxiv endwalker
[5:08:25] theDirtyon3: yeah not looking forward to 9.2 drought thats is gonna be rough
[5:08:33] Kneckt: 9.2.5 is the selfie camera v2
[5:08:33] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:08:35] Wildside1177: @theDirtyon3 TBCC!
[5:08:40] bantuatha: @themcfresh If you mean beyond space and dimension sure
[5:08:42] Aquadriel: @Towelliee As long as 9.1 entertains me till diablo2R launch i am good
[5:08:45] Murlocz: @Towelliee You will be playing New World?
[5:09:01] theDirtyon3: @Wildside1177 nah
[5:09:02] Armdel: one patch every 6 months. the new norm for wow
[5:09:03] MickyFresc: @bantuatha i mean many expansions have built on the current world in azeroth so?
[5:09:08] Aquadriel: dulslo they have warmode too
[5:09:09] Kittastrophe: blizzard plans releases out to mess with other games big releases and patches
[5:09:13] Wildside1177: @theDirtyon3 Oh un4ch.
[5:09:34] bantuatha: @themcfresh There are very few unexplore area in Azeroth.
[5:09:41] feherlofia123: @bluebeast33 lool
[5:09:46] bantuatha: What do you need Herbs for?
[5:09:54] nimrhen: @dulslo you should try xiv if you don't mind the story driven aspect
[5:09:57] FireEmblemLord: i play both wow and ff14 (i slept on vanilla)
[5:10:03] Murlocz: @Towelliee You will be playing New World?
[5:10:05] bantuatha: are there at burning steppes too?
[5:10:08] Mister_Ript: At least you can buy flying at 68 and navigate Netherstorm easily, as a Druid
[5:10:13] MickyFresc: @bantuatha people would've said that in vanilla? then wotlk added northrend, then cata added more stuff, then mop added stuff, etc etc etc
[5:10:23] Aquadriel: @Towelliee can we expect a 9.1.5 to match new world launch?
[5:10:55] bantuatha: @themcfresh Let's see what blizzard has stores for us in the future.
[5:11:00] Ohdies: how's the combat?
[5:11:17] BlueBeast33: Blizz is gonna need to bring Arthas out for 9.2
[5:11:22] MickyFresc: @bantuatha like what's stopping them from adding something else in azeroth? literally nothing, they do it all the time with newly discovered areas
[5:11:29] chrslp: 60% flying isnt for getting around. Its for getting to places you couldnt before
[5:11:36] feherlofia123: when is ashes alpha
[5:11:51] Aquadriel: I made it to 62 on classic. Thank GOD 9.1 is around the corner so i dont have to keep lvling at that soul draining pace.
[5:12:11] bantuatha: @themcfresh based on chronicle series I bet it will explore cosmic zone (Light and Void)
[5:12:25] Revanskal: i wonder why they havent implemented quick travel to major outposts.....without having to use a hearthstone
[5:12:26] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:12:45] MickyFresc: @bantuatha sure i'd be down for that! sounds pretty sick actually. I'd be team void because i currently main shadow priest :)
[5:13:28] akia03: is new world a pve or pvp kinda game?
[5:13:29] CritcobainTV: Fuckin stress -_- Mother's having some trouble breathing so i had to call an ambulance for her
[5:13:36] MickyFresc: @Dark_revan84 you mean like portals/ships/zeppelins ? oh wait
[5:13:42] feherlofia123: wasnt ashes alpha supposed to be out 2 months ago
[5:14:00] AzraelOfTheStorm: i loved warhammer
[5:14:05] Mister_Ript: That's how ARK: Survival Evolved is/was. Had to have people online at all times to protect your base from pvp raids
[5:14:18] MickyFresc: pay to win LUL
[5:14:24] MickyFresc: not at all
[5:14:34] MickyFresc: people are freaking out WAY too much over that stuff
[5:14:37] Moobot: Don't forget that every month you get a free Twitch Sub with Amazon Prime! towSellout Step 1 - twitch.amazon.com/prime Step 2 - Hit Subscribe on my channel page and HIT THIS BUTTON BABY i.imgur.com/XCoETwY.png towPog
[5:14:40] anticensor_: It has same amount of content as WOW but people are stuck to WOW unlike new world
[5:14:46] BJofBorg: @Critcobain Sorry to hear that. Hope she feels better soon
[5:14:50] kilowx: game will die super fast if they implement p2w tho, (it isnt)
[5:14:53] Tekromancy: lmao
[5:15:15] kilowx: bdo murdered its playerbase chasing whales
[5:15:25] MickyFresc: yeah i think people are somehow stuck in the mentality of wow vanilla where people bought the game and just played it with no mtx, but that isn't realistic in today's world
[5:15:26] plate_of_food: @rip_ript Man I remember 7 or 8 years ago sweating it out with a group of Belgian guys farming/raiding 14 hours a day on that game
[5:16:01] MickyFresc: because they don't want to, they're choosing another business model @dulslo
[5:16:03] TriumphantToad: sub seems like the best model but it seems like only certain games can pull it off
[5:16:04] Gizimoo86: BDO kinda p2w

[5:16:05] Pragma8123: @dulslo I agree with these, would prefer this way
[5:16:20] chrslp: When's your Mach-E come in Towelliee?
[5:16:22] MickyFresc: @TriumphantToad exactly. many people aren't willing to pay a sub
[5:16:25] zekobunny: The store is not the problem, the problem is what's on that store. If that stores interacts with the base game way too much it's flawed.
[5:16:31] belfastcl: people rarely think about the costs of having servers and systems running for a huge mmo
[5:16:41] Kaykerrs: Good morning towelliee!
[5:16:45] MrGattz: @dulslo because if you charge 15 a month for a game sub, people expect the game to have the amount of content that wow does for the same price. and no other mmo comes close to the amount of content so people see that as not worth it to them.
[5:16:49] kilowx: league of legends still has the all time best mtxs, no p2w
[5:16:55] kilowx: just cosmetic
[5:17:05] Pragma8123: Monthly subscriptions
[5:17:09] Ronsanicon: Same with POE
[5:17:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: magic Kappa
[5:17:10] Crush123: Thought you needed a sub for ESO
[5:17:11] TriumphantToad: even in 2009 my friends who would go to 3-4 movies a week and buy popcorn and shit would bitch about a sub, unfortunately. ppl are crazy
[5:17:19] kilowx: id argue stash tabs in poe are p2w
[5:17:22] MrGattz: @Crush123 long time ago you did, not anymore
[5:17:45] Crush123: @MrGattz oh didnt know that, might try it out now then
[5:17:50] Art_Bender: Ark has done it without a legit shop
[5:17:51] Darzetti_: there is an optional sub for ESO
[5:17:52] Aidler: but you have a choise - lol. no games or games with a store.
[5:17:54] Lantern214: I can see many here failed or never took economics XD
[5:17:58] Darzetti_: but not needed
[5:18:19] MrGattz: @kilowx i wouldnt. its a super handy feature, but id never say you need them. by the time you actually NEED them, you already probly have 20 hours in the game and paying 5 bucks or whatever isnt that bad for the RoI

[5:18:24] Gizimoo86: Make good game and sell crazy amount, then use profits to make more content and game keeps selling

[5:18:35] Kneckt: even WoW has a store KEK
[5:18:35] plate_of_food: ESO without a sub becomes an inventory management game though
[5:18:37] anticensor_: 50 YEARS KEKW
[5:18:54] flebbooo: KEKW
[5:18:59] Kaykerrs: Whatcha eating towelliee
[5:19:00] kilowx: @MrGattz Still is a slight advantage over another play, Its a very very small amount of p2w, but the advantage on other players is there, especially the public tab
[5:19:01] MickyFresc: @ZekoBunny this is the real world not fantasy
[5:19:02] MrGattz: @Crush123 oh i would for sure! its a fantastic exploratory mmo. best one i can think of.
[5:19:11] VirtualReign: i think a shop is perfectly fine as long as it doesn't offer in--game advantages, GW2 kind of hit the mark there, their shop is mostly cosmetics with some convenience thrown in there, and the items arepurchaseable through in-game currency as well as money
[5:19:12] Kaykerrs: Yummy
[5:19:15] Redpandalol: @towelliee I think it’s more so people just don’t want the store to be overbearing and don’t want to be nickel and dimed.
[5:19:17] chrslp: I dont remember hearing anyone complaining about MapleStory cosmetic store LUL
[5:19:20] chappers04: ohhh best combo
[5:19:33] dracullus: @Towelliee I'm 99% sure new store mount is coming with 9.1, wait for that shitstorm
[5:19:35] MickyFresc: @Redpandalol you mean nickel and dimed for totally optional content? LUL
[5:19:37] khybergoth: star citizen isn't even a MMO, is in eternal alpha, and they have a store
[5:19:41] Anjiera: don't forget Star Citizen in mmos that haven't launched and selling the hell outta stuff
[5:19:41] Moobot: towRF TBC CLASSIC Limited Edition TOWELLIEE shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towRF
[5:19:53] ogipk: Thats how most stores start
[5:19:55] Kneckt: WutFace
[5:19:55] akia03: why do people hate stores in games so much
[5:19:58] TowersOverYou: I think stores are ok, but random loot boxes suck
[5:20:05] mytherel: Age of Conan did not have a store :)
[5:20:07] TriumphantToad: ppl are fucking crazy man
[5:20:17] Sonatta: every game has a store now
[5:20:18] Pragma8123: I definitely understand having a store, and no MMO will not having a store going forward, but that's why I dont play MMOs anymore until classic came out
[5:20:20] TriumphantToad: amazon makes it more likely there'd be a store lmao
[5:20:21] chrslp: @mytherel Age of Conan also lasted like 6 months
[5:20:22] kilowx: I want a buy to play game with no store, and consist ant content and patches, I want that koolaid
[5:20:22] chrslp: LUL
[5:20:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: when the company making the game is literally a store what a shock LUL
[5:20:25] Sonatta: even single player games have stores now
[5:20:28] Aidler: new worlds store is, what I heared of it, reasonable.
[5:20:30] Sonatta: time to get over stores
[5:20:31] khybergoth: lmao AoC is not a good example
[5:20:38] theDirtyon3: LUL
[5:20:42] chrslp: AoC was the original MMO flop
[5:20:42] BlueBeast33: It's Amazon...how could you NOT think there would be a store
[5:20:48] Redpandalol: Store itself if okay but opening with omg look at our store sours it imo
[5:20:50] Deathkanigit101: I am waiting for a game to have something like door dash integrated into it.
[5:20:52] Wildside1177: Do people really think that the purchase price of a game can finance development of an MMO? Thats crazy. Have to have a store or subscription.
[5:20:52] Darzetti_: they def gonna have a store LUL
[5:20:53] bakurathewolf: LUL
[5:21:02] Kneckt: Kneckt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[5:21:02] Hanndul: riot LUL
[5:21:15] toesondanosehb: !ui
[5:21:16] Sonatta: league was built on the back of a store

[5:21:16] Cramer: they probably created the store first and designed the mmo around it
[5:21:29] Vivelli: riot is 100% going to have a shop lol
[5:21:41] Aidler: AoC store will be crazy.... but they need one too
[5:21:47] idenkaz_: we have been past this entire convo the moment people stopped giving a shit about fifa. just live with it and move on. dont spend money if you dont want to. its that simple. its so old by now jesus
[5:21:47] Pragma8123: @Wildside1177 For some people, a subscription and paying for content is preferable. But a store is always going to make more money
[5:21:50] kilowx: @Towelliee at least riot stores are cosmetic only :S
[5:21:54] plate_of_food: @Cramerr Honestly you're probably not wrong LUL
[5:22:24] dagala123: correct
[5:22:50] Mister_Ript: LOTRO -- Nuff Said
[5:22:53] Aidler: yeah the hardcore fan favorite AoC has a store as well - lol
[5:22:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:23:03] 1law_chroniclaw357: wow that cap is nasty, where you gotten it?
[5:23:03] RumMonster: AoC gonna be doa
[5:23:06] MrGattz: or you could buy a $10k space ship in star scam every citizen and they dont even have an alpha yet LUL
[5:23:26] chrslp: Everyone seems to forget AoC released and flopped once already LUL
[5:23:38] rsimpson105: @chrslp oooh it did?
[5:23:46] Sonatta: LOTRO and SWTOR keep their lights on with stores
[5:23:46] Pragma8123: The trick for the developers is to make enough of a store to appease the share-holders without making the game a money-sinkhole
[5:23:59] chrslp: @rsimpson105 Yeah it came out during TBC times and had crazy high system requirements for the time
[5:24:03] DecayedmiNt: @MrGattz Eh, to be fair. Their market is the Sim crowd. They have the money to do that.
[5:24:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: if wildstar ever comes back it will launch with a store day one
[5:24:52] DecayedmiNt: Wildstar can't come back
[5:24:55] Anjiera: and they're pretty much the only two(WoW/FFXIV) getting away with that model too box price sub and store
[5:24:56] DecayedmiNt: Carbine doesn't exist
[5:25:03] rsimpson105: @chrslp wait do you mean ashes or warhammer Age of Chaos?
[5:25:10] Renzay83: bro whats your herb level at?
[5:25:11] MrGattz: @Synthetiktek i mean your not wrong in the sense that they have the money but is that actually their market? isnt it more along the line of like elite dangerous and eve and that stuff? at least from the little iv seen from it
[5:25:12] Aidler: @HaxzorJimDuggan if Wildstar ever comes back it will mainly relaunch as a store.... swiftyHappy
[5:25:19] jason_tacey: what level you at?
[5:25:21] chrslp: @rsimpson105 Age of Conan KEKW
[5:25:22] MickyFresc: @Pragma8123 i dont think shareholders care whether or not there's a store really
[5:25:32] rsimpson105: @chrslp lmao oh yeah
[5:25:53] saltybcn: I think I went to SoS
[5:26:00] MrGattz: thats all they care about
[5:26:04] MrGattz: they dont care about the game lol
[5:26:07] idenkaz_: KEKW
[5:26:10] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[5:26:13] Heero_Effect: I have never seen your stream before. Im enjoying ;)
[5:26:14] Daggerdi3: Shareholders like money, news at 11
[5:26:17] CodyKane: just go to the hinterlands, you can pick the last 4 points there
[5:26:18] MickyFresc: no no i mean if a game is performing well enough on it's own it wouldn't matter, right?
[5:26:21] nimrhen: @themcfresh of course they do because it changes the revenue profile of the game
[5:26:22] chrslp: Shareholders dont care if we enjoy the game or not. They just want their return on their investment
[5:26:23] Aidler: shareholders care about money so they care about a ingame store
[5:26:28] Sonatta: how are we making money after launch? store. ok cool.
[5:26:32] buckshot_feast: no, they care about the integrity of the game first Kappa
[5:26:36] MrGattz: shareholders of WoW dont actually play wow, they just care if the game has subs or not LUL
[5:26:43] chrslp: ^
[5:26:49] Malarick: gotta maintain the revenue stream
[5:26:56] TuhrbanNovice: hol up, the like money? Kappa
[5:26:56] DecayedmiNt: @MrGattz Bit of both, meant to have elements that pull both crowds in. The ship aspect is 100% Sim. Considering you can also get the ships in game, but you lose them if they blow up.
[5:27:10] MrGattz: and its disgusting that they think that way. but thats the world we live in
[5:27:25] CritcobainTV: Wait a minute, so you're telling me that the first question shareholders ask isn't "Is the game gonna be fun though?"
[5:27:26] ByteSizedBits: shareholders always want more money
[5:27:27] CritcobainTV: WutFace
[5:27:27] Qualtar: Think about ticket prices at theaters or amusement parks. They don’t make revenue off the tickets, they make it off the food and shops.
[5:27:52] hrdstylem: ya it doesnt matter how well a business is doing they always want more
[5:27:53] Rudric_Ice: humans r greedy bastards
[5:27:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: correct answer is all
[5:27:57] chrslp: Look at people holding GameStop stock still LUL

IF WE DON'T BOOK AN ACT FOR YOU, OUR SERVICE IS FREE. Why would they say that if they KNEW they could book him
[5:42:36] Six9A: Also, MJ is also only being paid a million for the appearance because there is probably some royalty clause in the contract
