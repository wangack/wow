[3:18:49] Sniper_Penguin: pvp in SOD is a meme..

[3:18:49] Thoreya: @OGaxelaw that doesnt exist in retail anymore
[3:18:53] jarilrpg: classic was always like that, you got the best gear in raids, then PVP
[3:19:43] OGaxelaw: thats all they do is hold back players who have the time to play the game in favor of players who cant because "RL" thats not excuse

[3:49:47] Vigi9413: it’s just leveling in vanilla AGAIN.. I can’t do it lol
[3:49:48] im_n0t_jezus: yeah beginning is fun.. later from 55-60 is like the worset part
[3:50:04] Phatori: only reason I stoped lvling in classic was the classes felt incomplete. now they feel better. lvl 25 atm. farthest I did before was 10 lol
[3:50:20] Molvonos: 40-50 is World of Sunken Temple
[3:50:26] im_n0t_jezus: true 40-50 is like nowhere land
[3:50:28] Sniper_Penguin: 40-50 is the worst.. theres no questing really and you have to run everywhere

[3:50:47] Brodih_: 40 to 50, theres ZF and ST only right?
[3:50:49] Wcvechten: watch them turn ZF into a raid
[3:50:51] 91Niki: Sup Towelliee and chat towHi
[3:51:04] Molvonos: Eyy Niki
[3:51:07] Mattucho: this isn't Classic
[3:51:11] im_n0t_jezus: yeah its sick ZF
[3:51:14] maventar: ZF, ST and some of BRD
[3:51:20] Brodih_: Sunken temple would be better
[3:51:25] Wcvechten: And people love Troll raids still apparantly, so might aswell
[3:51:29] im_capy: "If you dont know how to wall skip, your kicked"
[3:51:37] im_n0t_jezus: Maura too no?
[3:51:46] 91Niki: I guess they postponed the D4 gauntlet again again lol
[3:51:48] Alcaeus_: if they release some more of that student fodder its gonna make 40-50 a little more palatable
[3:51:51] TheeCableguy: they fixed it a bit with the hot fix
[3:51:54] TheeCableguy: not nearly as bad rn
[3:52:04] lostrealist: slow spawns and no one wants to group for kill quests which is frustrating
[3:52:08] im_capy: @91Niki towCry
[3:52:09] Ghostzapp3r: There was like 10 layers last night
[3:52:09] TheeCableguy: they added more realms and made questing decent

[3:52:26] KaisenSiru: D4 Pog
[3:52:39] Wulfgrym: Rods hiding from the MS HR people
[3:52:40] KroniclyLazy: "We have it on our radar..." KEKW
[3:52:45] Elderpug27: the SM grind is insufferable
[3:53:09] jarilrpg: i havent been able to play D4 since the 1.3.1 update, there is a NVME harddrive problem. mine crashes on startup
[3:53:16] wisperuna: @Towelliee Man they will launch it with Last Epoch to be competative
[3:53:19] Fazzar7: @maventar ST?

[3:54:26] devilhawk83: chrysLUL Last Epoch is going to get a lot of Diablo 4 players and watch Blizzard do a June release for Vessel of Hatred thinking the PoE2 beta be around that time
[3:54:35] TheeCableguy: was same team as seasonal team
[3:54:39] 91Niki: Right, but the devs in charge of it, might not call the shots of when it is released.
[3:55:02] Wulfgrym: d4 blew that currency
[3:55:07] wisperuna: Well they have tired it with other games so
[3:55:13] wisperuna: It's just the blizzard brand
[3:55:19] maventar: @Fazzar7 Sunken Temple
[3:55:28] lostrealist: no advantage when their running on pure nostalgia and sunk cost LUL
[3:55:33] Titannborn: y dude
[3:55:41] 91Niki: The sweaty D4 fans basically
[3:55:59] Syllvn: You also are not moving huge dev projects literal months to try to upset POE or any game.
[3:55:59] Firedexx: Firedexx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 127 months! 
[3:55:59] KaisenSiru: HahaSweat HahaSweat
[3:56:00] whiskytrix: d4 is wholely disappointing
[3:56:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: best chance to get a top leaderboard position lol everyone will be in last epoch
[3:56:03] DirtyBeef2134: scheduled maintenance in 7 minutes?
[3:56:04] AlotaSpinz: 8 raiders from AlotaSpinz have joined! 
[3:56:07] 91Niki: I basically finished my Druid in D4, got it to 100 and finished the season chapters and called it a day
[3:56:13] im_capy: I just couldnt get into LE, something with the soundFX and floaty feel of my character. Not sure if 1.0 addresses that though. I really want to like LE
[3:56:31] devilhawk83: @91niki I feel the D4 team is so reactively feeling that they need to do it in reaction to what others are doing instead of just being quiet and release it when it is ready
[3:56:41] Syllvn: @91Niki This is basically how I play, finish the season and come back next season. Am fine with it
[3:56:50] expbottles: I got laid off today plenty of time to level now LOL
[3:57:15] devilhawk83: oof
[3:57:17] wisperuna: @im_capy I think you need to try it  now as they addressed a lot of things during the years of development still the game is far from perfect but good.
[3:57:19] im_capy: ah ok, ill give it a fair go
[3:57:23] Alcaeus_: might take a break from SoD and play LE my guild is gonna take awhile to get ten people to 40. Ill atleast be watching it
[3:57:24] nuuenergy: make sure to get the FP on the island for the next part of the quest
[3:57:24] TheeCableguy: I like d4's combat feel more but LE is my level of complexity that I like
[3:57:39] raldrik: if you play the newer classes that isnt the case. That is said to be fixed for the 1.0 release. Lots of people have lots of expectations on what is coming out in 1.0 that is for sure
[3:57:41] zerochill89: good morning everyone
[3:57:53] 91Niki: @devilhawk83 I think the issue is more the fact that there are game devs, those who build, who have ZERO say in when and what. And then there is the people in charge, who does have a say in what and when, and THOSE people don't know what they fuck they are doing
[3:58:32] 91Niki: @Syllvn If a season is really good, I will play it more than just that. Once D4 has the end game content like D3, I will stick around much longer
[3:58:35] wisperuna: Well keep in mid they are not a large company
[3:58:38] devilhawk83: Soon be vault time in retail as I finally got Rezan’s Gleaming Eye after 60 AD runs last night chrysLUL
[3:59:16] DecayedmiNt: I stopped buying new games outside of WoW releases
[3:59:20] expbottles: I’m running the Druid for sure
[3:59:49] wisperuna: They have had a strong presence  the game was in early access so people had played it trought the course of develompment.
[4:00:04] TheeCableguy: just dinged 40 x.x
[4:00:08] expbottles: paladin true
[4:00:09] im_capy: @wisperuna Ya, me and the wife gonna give it another go for sure
[4:00:11] devilhawk83: I am hoping to get the Rageheart or the neck from Volcoross from my vault today though I know I am likely getting trolled hard for my vault
[4:00:12] jarilrpg: @DecayedmiNt i normally wait till they go on sale before picking them up (and any launch bugs are fixed)
[4:00:13] Herzenliegen: Esfand only has time to rp cornwood on gta LUL

[4:27:06] Wulfgrym: Thats how you shit on D4, without saying it
[4:27:07] Sollice: I am sorry I am pretty sure I have asked this before but Last Epoch is multiplayer right? Is it match making like D3 or whow does that work?
[4:27:32] Nazkol: can anyone link the video?
[4:27:39] Wulfgrym: @Sollice yeah its multiplayer, no guilds but you can group
[4:27:55] Sollice: So is it more single player focused?
[4:28:14] Wulfgrym: KEKW
[4:28:33] devilhawk83: chrysLUL chrysLUL
[4:28:33] lel3owski: just get 5 uber uniques lol
[4:28:42] metavahn231: d4 just looks so slow in comparison to poe and last epoch
[4:28:49] Wulfgrym: crafting overpowered weapons for new toons!!!! the outrage, ded game
[4:28:55] 91Niki: @Sollice I believe it is like POE on that aspect. You see people in town, but that is it
[4:29:01] 91Niki: correct me if I am wrong chat
[4:29:16] gfield2k: when does this come out ?
[4:29:23] Wulfgrym: @91Niki maybe, i could be wrong
[4:29:25] metavahn231: PVP DansGame
[4:29:35] DJDitra: that's correct @91Niki
[4:29:44] 91Niki: You can't definitely play with people, but you aren't forced, like D4
[4:29:47] Wulfgrym: KEKW
[4:29:55] metavahn231: a ladder system without pay for power? sooo dumb
[4:30:00] 91Niki: @DJDitra Ty! I wasn't 100% sure
[4:30:01] Sollice: So to match with match making in dungeons or like friends only list?

[4:30:13] DunzoCD: it actually does solo self found right too, so you get more drops if you arent trading
[4:30:13] metavahn231: they should take notes from diablo immortal
[4:30:16] Calibur84: It's funny and accurate lol
[4:30:27] Wulfgrym: LOL what a horrible game! back to d4 LUL
[4:30:32] Vladeimir: so stupid, I love it
[4:30:36] 91Niki: @Sollice I think it's like POE, where you play alone until you chose to play with friends, like D3. But see people in town
[4:30:40] raldrik: that was a great video
[4:30:49] TheeCableguy: Here is a random pally tank build: https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/bleed-hammerdin-guide

[4:30:57] 91Niki: KEKW
[4:31:07] Wulfgrym: blizzard multi-dollar company
[4:31:09] gfield2k: what's the name of his Youtube channel ?
[4:31:12] 91Niki: Oh it is 100% leadership issue
[4:31:12] littl3mike: that was a great video!
[4:31:16] DunzoCD: they prolly just laid off the ladder guy Kappa
[4:31:16] im_n0t_jezus: why couldnt they copy pasta the l;adder from D3 to D4
[4:31:18] zhr0: Blizz can't have that many stash tabs, because your games loads everyone's inventory stash when you zone
[4:31:18] TheeCableguy: Here is a random pally tank build for LE: https://youtu.be/hv3B34qc0Kk
[4:31:20] Hebrewish012: well I mean they laid off a bunch of people
[4:31:24] Wulfgrym: Rod, its all about Rod
[4:31:26] PokerFaceMoose: what was that video link or name of video?
[4:31:27] im_capy: We just have too much copium for Blizz
[4:31:28] Colt_Engineer: yes there's a disconnect, the servers are down Kappa
[4:31:37] invisibleboomer: Sir Last Epoch is just POE2
[4:31:38] metavahn231: it dont even have $20 legendary crests to activate a dungeon wtf....
[4:31:44] 91Niki: It's all about the leadership calling the shots. The leadership we don't see the faces off

[4:31:56] shellfishguy: well I finally broke down and bought last epoch lol
[4:31:56] tlsmith3638: they let the ladder guy go by accident some paper got mixed up
[4:31:58] TamaskaVT: Here's a fact from someone who still plays D4: Rob sucks and has no clue what he is doing. Furthermore the devs themselves have no clue either. Ok rant over.
[4:31:59] gfield2k: @PokerFaceMoose That's what I want as well
[4:32:04] Wulfgrym: i swear, Rod hides under his desk when MS HR is in the room and doesn't check his email
[4:32:06] Colt_Engineer: How long was D3 in development compared to D4 though? D3 was in developmental hell for over a decade

[4:32:25] Hebrewish012: and they do practice the AAA dev habits, which is only let people code tiny parts never see the full pictures
[4:32:32] im_capy: Maybe they just see how little D4 is being played, so they cut back on dev time and just took the L
[4:32:34] Wulfgrym: maybe they got kneecapped somehow but still, its pretty sad
[4:32:42] Hebrewish012: then they combine together a frankensteind game
[4:32:45] raldrik: LE has been in early access since April 2019
[4:32:45] Wcvechten: Feels like that stubborn OG blizzard mindset, they decide the fun, not us
[4:32:46] Colt_Engineer: neither did D3 though, D3 took like 3 years until it was good
[4:32:48] 91Niki: @Towelliee My guess is the leadership calling the shots are all "making money" focused. So all the shots being called is being made with a money making standpoint in mind
[4:32:51] Kalec_Stromhir: D4 still no community like D3 had, so much missed out
[4:32:56] AzedaNA: @Towelliee Corporate software dev is a clusterfuck and it's very much not ran by devs.
[4:32:56] PokerFaceMoose: what is the link or name of that last video, id like to share it?
[4:32:58] TheeCableguy: Okay Shia
[4:33:01] TheeCableguy: we get it
[4:33:01] sircheex: tbh Diablo4 is one of the only groups with big hiring going on still with blizzard
[4:33:02] DunzoCD: D3 didnt get good til Reaper of Souls too
[4:33:03] Badd_Boi: D4 game directors are clueless
[4:33:05] metavahn231: d4 seems to just be a mmo lite, and half arpg
[4:33:10] DecayedmiNt: They could've been under contract work to and fullfilled said contract, especially if it was artist related
[4:33:13] Colt_Engineer: once RoS came out for D3 that was the saving point for the game
[4:33:16] Wulfgrym: D4 meme. Just Don't DO IT.
[4:33:17] motorboatingpro: sounds like a red tape thing, where 15 people got to approve something
[4:33:24] gfield2k: @Towelliee what was the guys channel you just watched ?
[4:33:25] invisibleboomer: Sir we do not make fun of diablo4 just because it has a ED and news a blue chewy
[4:33:26] 91Niki: Slow the process of how everything is put into the game, keep people coming back, and when they come back you hope they buy stuff in the store

[4:33:34] PotbellyGoat: @91Niki that and they talked about having a team for the season, another team for a different season, a team working on the main game- no way all those groups are going to gel
[4:33:37] Colt_Engineer: It will, D3 too a long time for D3 to get good
[4:33:47] im_capy: The store tmog sure looks good in D4 though LUL
[4:33:48] metavahn231: diablo didnt need to be rebooted but d4 feels like a soft reboot that isent diablo
[4:33:51] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee Long story short, D4 was built for the D2 crowd that would never accept it, Forgot the lessons learned from a decade+ of D3 development, course correcting from the single player esque game they made to an actual ARPG while clawing its way up to modern genre standards.
[4:33:54] fizzywinks: D4 devs prob think they are too good to learn from other ARPGs, too arrogant and proud. Old school blizzard games were good because they took shit form other games and made it their own
[4:33:54] Bulgogiprince: D4 is that game that added thing on the fly that was popular at the point in development
[4:33:56] TheeCableguy: well next season will be a major overhaul to itemization
[4:33:56] 91Niki: @PotbellyGoat Yeah then the whole issue of communication comes into play
[4:33:58] Calibur84: Blizzard is too big of company that's it. All they care about is money now. Release the game and make as much as possible
[4:34:01] DunzoCD: they should have put the alter from that last D3 season into D4 imo
[4:34:06] instant_savage: maybe adding crusader would help just a lil bit...
[4:34:09] Dakaa: poe and last epoch are games made by gamers for gamers
[4:34:16] kalithian2: i think its because the shareholders are like release the new stuff, and the devs are like, but sir its not finished yet and they go i dont care release it
[4:34:17] Dakaa: d4 is all predatory bs
[4:34:18] tlsmith3638: on a seroius note just like all other  diablo games  when the xpac hits and everything is "fixed" it will be fine
[4:34:27] 91Niki: People forget that the actual GAME DEVS on D4 have ZERO to say in terms of what gets released and how. They are just told what to create
[4:34:32] im_capy: They put more time into letting us pick our eye color in D4......and we cant even see them in game. Their focus is waaaay off
[4:34:32] Wulfgrym: no
[4:34:34] snake_like: catJAM darkest dungeon
[4:34:34] Arashikaiju: Hell no.
[4:34:35] Wulfgrym: hell no
[4:34:37] invisibleboomer: Towelliee sir just give Diablo4 a blue chewy it will be fine
[4:34:38] fizzywinks: there is nothing D2 about D4 lmao
[4:34:39] Dred_Scythe: D2 people only accept D2
[4:34:40] Wulfgrym: 100% no
[4:34:41] Colt_Engineer: D2 crowd would never be happy with D4
[4:34:43] JuiceBoxDrizzle: D4 is literally a reskin of D3
[4:34:44] heinekings: not even close
[4:34:49] DunzoCD: no its like the hardcore classic wow players they will always just play D2
[4:34:50] Kalec_Stromhir: maybe now allen adham gone from d4, may see something
[4:34:54] metavahn231: the gear is just too cookie cutter
[4:35:03] dokor: @Towelliee it's probably gonna be the same ting as D3, it's gonna take a long time for them to build the game to a point where we gonna be able to enjoy it
[4:35:04] hammack52: i think it has to do with there are too many hands in the cookie jar with D4
[4:35:04] Wulfgrym: @JuiceBoxDrizzle thats a slap to d3 LUL
[4:35:07] devilhawk83: Diablo 2 fans will say D4 is a massive disappointment
[4:35:13] PokerFaceMoose: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFY3gblZ28 was the video towelliee just watched
[4:35:22] hammack52: too many bosses wanting different things to come out of the game
[4:35:26] JuiceBoxDrizzle: @Wulfgrym No not one bit D3 was god awful
[4:35:26] PotbellyGoat: I saved monoliths for launch so I have something new to do
[4:35:27] Wulfgrym: at least they waited to release till they had a fully functioning game
[4:35:30] im_capy: You get to be a paladin, already on the up and up
[4:35:40] mrsig27: mrsig27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 65 months! 
[4:35:42] xvstormvx: @Towelliee my only problem with epoch is they dont have a anti-cheat
[4:35:45] 91Niki: Oh for sure
[4:35:45] Calibur84: I like the lore of Diablo that's the only reason I still fuck with D4
[4:35:50] kalithian2: the play style of D4 is more similar to D2 than it is to D3 isnt it????
[4:36:03] im_capy: tossing his team under the bus
[4:36:09] Wulfgrym: @JuiceBoxDrizzle it was but i loved GR's i would take that over this shit d4 gave us
[4:36:11] Pearsi: Pearsi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 125 months, currently on a 125 month streak! 
[4:36:19] devilhawk83: I will say D4 even though it was better than D3 at launch, the developers are just completely disconnected about the state of the game FailFish
[4:36:22] 91Niki: And whoever calls the shots are incredibly bad at telling people what to prioritize on in terms of development
[4:36:39] Wulfgrym: Rod can't look more stupid, hes maxed out his stupid rep
[4:36:43] DunzoCD: its totally mismanaged for sure on the Diablo team
[4:36:46] JuiceBoxDrizzle: @Wulfgrym I can agree with you on that GR"s were pretty fun
[4:36:58] TamaskaVT: Yeah Rod ought to be replaced and I have to say a lot of the devs too
[4:37:01] im_capy: D4 took the welcome to hell to literally
[4:37:07] Demygoon: Demygoon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! 61!
[4:37:07] Wulfgrym: @JuiceBoxDrizzle and i agree iwth you on the rest =D
[4:37:26] Wulfgrym: MS needs to do an intervention
[4:37:30] instant_savage: well last epoch looks amazing  for 30$ and d4 was a waste of 70$ at the current moment,  atleast imo
[4:37:30] 91Niki: @Towelliee and the actual people calling the last shots, we don't see their faces
[4:37:32] im_capy: feature creep
[4:37:36] Tinit5190: The sad part is each season end does get better. But man the releases of the seasons are so shit.
[4:37:50] kalithian2: sounds like time gating in order to stretch content
[4:37:56] im_capy: it ruins products every single time
[4:37:57] JQ47: I do think Diablo was pushed out the door early but they need to do something because this is a mess
[4:37:58] DunzoCD: papa phil about to slam the hammer on the Diablo team if they dont get it figured out
[4:38:06] Wulfgrym: well let them nickle and dime, the player base will go play poe and last epoch
[4:38:20] 91Niki: Feature creeping is definitely what is happening in D4, and it is ALL done cuz of the in game store @Towelliee . Keep people coming back and buy the new shit in the store as features come out
[4:38:20] Raddius: Agreed, I don't feel confident when I see/hear Rod.
[4:38:24] Tinit5190: I've already given up and moved on. That pet release was crap. He felt literally useless
[4:38:38] raldrik: It kills it. Want to play the ladder but then the hype of the season is gone so dont bother even going back to try the new stuff
[4:38:46] invisibleboomer: Towelliee sir you sound  like you need a hug
[4:38:59] instant_savage: the d4 cosmetics are amazing tho, blizzard enver fails with art in there games
[4:39:10] Tinit5190: And then there is no point to try the ladder because the degens are now SO FAR AHEAD because they powered through the shitty part.

[4:39:38] im_capy: facts
[4:39:54] 91Niki: I feel so fucking bad for all the actual game devs on D4. Especially those whos faces are being put on display
[4:39:56] TamaskaVT: Rod from the first fireside chat lost tons of confidence from me. Then he just keeps doing stupid stupid crap and I now just want him gone.
[4:40:13] 91Niki: and we don't see who the top is

[4:40:53] Wcvechten: ''but which tuesday, haha!''

[4:41:27] Wulfgrym: someones getting fired his keeps happening
[4:41:47] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Oh i wouldn't be surprised if he got a warning already from the top to stfu

[4:42:07] instant_savage: @Towelliee any retail vaults today?
[4:42:17] kalithian2: yeah they're like its ready tuesday, and the devs are like um sir, no its not, well uh, is it ready enough to release it anyways?  um yeah but.......no buts, release it and we'll fix it later
[4:42:29] SpoofAvatar: invest in some knee pads
[4:42:34] 91Niki: @TamaskaVT Nah, don't. I got the 100 dollar version. And I know D4 will be good with time, just like D3 is. I have patience
[4:42:39] Wulfgrym: @91Niki yep
[4:42:43] Noshpan: Yeah, pitbull & labrador tails are deadly weapons
[4:42:48] Wcvechten: I bet that 10.2.6 thing is that datamined hearthstone stuff
[4:42:49] 1llum1n471: What did you say, @Towelliee? I was looking at my bag full of yellows...
[4:42:52] instant_savage: did they annouce a token vendor like we have in shadowlands season 4?
[4:43:18] felinesanonymous: I’ve stepped away from retail until WWI. I hope the game really changes in WWI.
[4:43:27] devilhawk83: chrysLUL One thing I got a lot of appreciation for a lot of developers is that they don’t say when something is coming till they say that they feel comfortable releasing it. Something that the head of the Diablo 4 development team should take note and say it is coming, be patient and we will take feedback on what we can implement
[4:43:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: im a kickstarter backer and i only got base

[4:48:53] reggiepowa: man I wish d4 had better endgame because all these other games graphically look like crap
[4:49:08] COMMEdesRATS: Is that a golden knights jersey you're rocking?
[4:49:09] PotbellyGoat: this build seems like something I would play
[4:49:25] vaironixx: @COMMEdesRATS last epoch 1.0 gets a graphical update
[4:49:35] PokerFaceMoose: Buy Last Epoch - Standard Edition Pre-Order Includes 2 Items: Last Epoch and "Golden Guppy" the Baby Chronowyrm.  looks like pre-order gets the guppy
[4:50:07] fizzywinks: prob will do a hammeradin
[4:50:12] Spyflry: There is a hammer build somewhere, this guy just isnt using it
[4:50:52] Sicknessqt: Nice boss Kappa
[4:50:52] Wulfgrym: that shit is bonkers
[4:51:17] snake_like: that's some d3 vanilla leech on hit levels of drain
[4:51:51] kalithian2: damn, he's like a blood dk or a bear druid in pvp, just like good luck killing me, not gonna happen
[4:52:27] metavahn231: oh this is the "alright?" guy
[4:52:32] TamaskaVT: I want Last Epoch to be super amazing, and I think it will be. The reason I want it to do so well is to hopefully put enough pressure on Blizzard and the D4 team to actually make D4 much better. Competition helps do great things.
[4:52:53] im_capy: "2h tanking"
[4:52:54] Wulfgrym: cant play a paladin without a shield, 2hand tanks in SOD KEKW
[4:52:58] TheRonWeedsley: mmm ret pally build  i like it

[4:53:26] Chester994: I am not gonna lie, my wife loves physical penetration, she might like this game.
[4:53:28] t_train_va: Because LE is middle ground
[4:53:34] Sicknessqt: Diablo 5 will
[4:53:36] Colt_Engineer: where's judjment at? Kappa
[4:53:41] Wulfgrym: last epoch is just showing how inept blizzard is with d4
[4:53:41] t_train_va: PoE too complex, D4 too simple, LE is middle ground
[4:53:43] Colt_Engineer: what about seal of command
[4:53:54] Colt_Engineer: or ardent defender?
[4:54:30] devilhawk83: konazbSnacc I like PoE complexity as it makes me want to try some wacky builds
[4:54:34] vaironixx: busted is fun though

[5:00:49] Dred_Scythe: Aaron is Icey veins...
[5:00:49] kalithian2: yeah he's balancing his damage with life steal, i think the build is designed to be the harder he hits the more he health steals and heals himself

[5:18:46] fizzywinks: most ridiculous is melee hunters topping gnomeragan DPS tier lists
[5:19:07] lostrealist: starsurge nerf is so lazy. could have just added a reduction to players :(
[5:19:22] metavahn231: its like being able to get hydra from just doin a pvp event for a few days
[5:19:31] TheRonWeedsley: bis axe from end gnomer boss i think
[5:19:43] GodTheMechanic: Tbf, most of the Gnomer bosses are made of metal
[5:20:15] Pups_Gersky: I have been melee hunter since lvl 1
[5:21:06] GodKingMuninn: Rogues need fleet fotted so bad
[5:21:06] Wulfgrym: yes that happened to me
[5:21:07] Alaquane: starsurge gank squads
[5:21:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like a wookie! LUL
[5:21:33] Wulfgrym: army of bush wookies
[5:21:34] GodKingMuninn: Rogues feel like warriors in MoP with all our main targets now having some form of mobility/immunity.
[5:21:36] Alaquane: FortBush
[5:21:40] GodKingMuninn: just waddle 24/7
[5:21:44] LuminolRS: Thoughts on feral viability for M+?
[5:21:50] Gungre: I loved just shitting on boomkins in stv as a rogue. They'd come out, my priest would survive their starsurge, and then I'd just cc them to death
[5:22:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those hunter pets are no joke
[5:22:11] Troggie: accurate
[5:22:17] DunzoCD: KEKW pvpers complaining about balance classic
[5:22:20] 91Niki: That's a "i ain't reading all that. i'm happy for you tho, or sorry that happened" situation
[5:22:43] metavahn231: boomer gamer dads malding
[5:22:51] rude_bastardo: he's Mrbucket
[5:22:52] Gungre: Well, too be fair, they did come out and say that starsurge's damage was bugged and had 100% scaling instead of it's original intended scaling
[5:22:56] Vondrex: ya pvp is boring to me on mmos, or maybe I am just an old man
[5:22:59] Wcvechten: But  then they must touch icky retail
[5:23:11] GodKingMuninn: Starsurge feels a whole let bullshit, still fucking hurts though.
[5:23:13] im_capy: PvP in retail I think has looooong wait times
[5:23:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Retail PvP is pretty good, the devs keep working on balance
[5:23:18] Lilbru: the TLDR person gets it. this is supposed to be an extension of classic, which had tons of bullshit pvp. this is just a continuation of that. if people want pvp balance, they should go to retail
[5:23:21] lostrealist: they did the same thing to hunters p1, lazy nerfs to both instead of pvp only
[5:23:28] Jackietothemoon: is game coming up soon?
[5:23:31] rude_bastardo: time to sub.been following a while
[5:23:40] zelours: Goldtooth EU in shambles

[5:24:09] HoboFighter2: Did wowhead decide not to post any BIS/example builds for Phase 2?
[5:24:11] Lilbru: yeeepp
[5:24:11] Troggie: Why is it never lets buff something...
[5:24:16] TheRonWeedsley: yea kinda dont want to level my boomy now because of this nerf, solo druid leveling during p1 was very fun
[5:24:21] GodKingMuninn: They can't even fix tooltips in classic. I won't hold my breath on seperate pvp and pve tuning LUL

[5:24:58] merzicdh: huh? someone saaaaay fresh?
[5:24:59] Bowwjack: @Towelliee they cry about class balance in classic pvp because they are/will never be good enough to be decent enough for those nerfs to ever actually be effective.

[5:25:39] delaine: @HoboFighter2 they've been busy posting the 40 different "a look back" articles
[5:25:41] Lilbru: imo SoD team shouldnt focus so much on pvp balance, it takes away from classic feel
[5:25:42] ZombieBrigade: login servers up  waiting on them to hit the GO button
[5:25:42] Remmah_D: 3 resto druids w/ 2 enh shammies in g2 for inf mana inf starsurge
[5:26:07] HoboFighter2: @delaine lol true
[5:26:30] metavahn231: yea thats the bad pvp
[5:26:31] 6all: 6 seconds
[5:26:31] Wcvechten: Healing nature with stars
[5:26:33] Alaquane: 6?
[5:26:34] Maydie6066: Sounds like a skill issue IMO Kappa
[5:26:35] Lilbru: 6s
[5:26:35] nuuenergy: 5 seconds or something but 8 mana
[5:26:37] Dakix: 6 sceconds like 4 mana
[5:26:37] zhr0: They roll 3 Druids, spriest and maybe a pally
[5:26:38] Velarn435: They're gangbangin in pvp now?
[5:26:41] Alaquane: something low
[5:26:48] penandsword49: 6 seconds and 4 mana at level 30
[5:26:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember multiboxers with like 4 shamans or 4 boomkins and yeah if they all do it together it nukes someone
[5:26:52] Dakix: broken
[5:26:57] Shock0neThree: realm list is up
[5:26:58] nyypsycho: i am level 38 i need to get back into SM so i can raid tonight with my guild

[5:27:49] GodKingMuninn: End of the day though, boomies are a scape goat for the real enemy. Warlocks
[5:28:03] Masqerader: I hated 2s in tbc,  rogue druid, warrior shaman.... if u fought one of them combos.... lol was a long day
[5:28:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Trying to balance out things for PvP in SOD is one hell of a challenge
[5:28:15] Troggie: are tank warlocks in pvp unkillable too?
[5:28:33] bullorbear420: warlocks will be in the conversation for #1 this whole entire SOD. blizz made their bed with the meta rune
[5:29:16] Remmah_D: that can easily be fixed with a player aura invisible buff
[5:29:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Warlock tanks should be killing everyone, they can reduce damage and get their health back, constantly
[5:30:29] DunzoCD: give me back meta as a lock in retail please, i miss old demo
[5:30:59] snake_like: I'm sorry. What warlock is surviving a few mutilates, mangles, or a priest pressing 3 buttons. am I missing something
[5:31:04] snake_like: even with meta
[5:31:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know if the rogues can stunlock murder the warlocks, maybe
[5:32:51] snake_like: the answer is yes: warlock is annihilated by even unskilled druids, rogues, or priests. pretty much any class is

[5:53:01] Masqerader: i guess if they wanted they could just make it impossible to trade items inside dungeon while putting gold in the trade window, and once the item is traded it can't be traded again?  one way to shut it down
[5:53:02] im_capy: Not now, but it was a big thing on Twitch. They could just watch them and note all the accounts easy to send out a warning
[5:53:59] im_capy: When Soda openly admitted to buying gold on his stream and he barely got a slap on the wrist, we knew it was bad

[8:23:48] Keanuu: button to button  works. you really dont wanna hit your range with the fire, if they have a button to press while you're passing itll go sideways
[8:24:55] justpeacealways: Are casters better than melee in phase 2?
[8:25:22] justpeacealways: Phase 1 seemed to favor melee, that sounds nice
[8:25:46] jarilrpg: @justpeacealways melee is bad because some of these bosses have more armor than level 60 bosses

[8:59:35] TheGamerME: whats so fun in just buying what ya need? eq2 is doing that now
[9:00:00] Alaquane: I thought they said they were going to investigate making it easier to acquire. then suggested something "maybe like a vendor, we don't know"
[9:00:10] Wulfgrym: @TheGamerME its not about fun, its super hard to get people to do those quests where you need groups
[9:00:30] 91Niki: Yeah so the CHILL flavor is not on the regular ADV website
[9:00:59] Alaquane: maybe it's a legal protection thing to keep chill separate?
[9:01:25] 91Niki: @Alaquane Possibly
[9:01:47] rakimm: they dont ship to europe?
[9:02:03] 91Niki: Yeah it is probably because they ship to EU, and EU's CBD laws are different that US
[9:03:25] TheGamerME: even in the us law is different. I live in Maine  and people can't sell CBd that wasen't made in maine .

[9:04:40] Kaykerrs: best water is 1992
[9:04:40] 91Niki: @TheGamerME Honestly it has more to do with paperwork than law. Plenty of countries in EU allow CBD to be sold as long as the THC is 0 or below 0.02%. However, the amount of paperwork you have to go through to sell it, just isn't worth it
[9:05:05] zerochill89: Is it just sold online?
[9:05:14] Alaquane: need an innervate after forting everyone HypeLol
[9:05:38] TheGamerME: i hea rya niki . paper work  does suck . I bet theres alot of fees as well
[9:05:54] 91Niki: @TheGamerME Also not exactly true. I spend time in Maine, and have no issues ordering CBD products to the house. It might be different if you are to sell CBD products in a physical store. But online not so much
[9:06:21] 91Niki: @TheGamerME Fees as well yep!
