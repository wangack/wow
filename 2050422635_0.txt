[0:26:57] Mind_G0bl1n: @Eternal_Toaster gnomechomsky
[0:27:05] maverrick15: they made a big deal about it so i would imagine they may include a rune in bfd
[0:27:07] rsSilence: I really think the move is to send a BFD immediately and then dungeon grind
[0:27:17] Sastan: But mobs of BFD dont  have Lvl? they dont become gray?
[0:27:18] Pulleft: pvp Pog

[0:28:57] grylz89: Correct
[0:28:57] shiggydoo43: yes they said ESPECIALLY the new boxes will give xp
[0:29:14] uniquename4: Is there anything new at honored/revered?
[0:29:28] littlehak: It's a nightmare
[0:29:29] Baxst: i have 40 lol
[0:29:38] hennessy147: oh god
[0:29:44] hennessy147: worst
[0:29:45] littlehak: @Baxst Wait how do you stack the boxes?
[0:29:45] KaiBudde: what they really need is to put npcs to turn those boxes at one quest hub in each zone. running to major cities is just stupid.
[0:29:56] Eternal_Toaster: Staysafe I must know what I should name my Gnome lock, it must come from you.
[0:29:57] raspyoftow: farming boxes is more stressful then working at walmart
[0:30:03] Baxst: once they filled up they stack
[0:30:15] DankWizard420: the 4 or 5 I did for friendly I just logged out for hearthstone KEKW
[0:30:20] bots_bots: its likely the tier 2 boxes wont give rep after honored...
[0:30:21] littlehak: @Baxst well F me, I didn't know that, thanks
[0:30:22] loudriantv: with the same way of xp they might not even give rep
[0:30:27] ATcaribou: I did 12 boxes in 2 hours earlier to make sure I get honored on launch. then I moved on to questing for gold on an alt
[0:30:39] DankWizard420: just carry every resource on you pepeD
[0:30:44] ClinxyWow: jorme has 36 lol
[0:30:51] Mind_G0bl1n: @Eternal_Toaster knobgoblin
[0:30:51] legend3binderino: @ATcaribou are they not anymore unique?
[0:30:56] Bloodraven2488: 14 slot
[0:30:59] brenndannn: i got 16 on my druid in my bags, but this is sad news lol

[0:31:03] lequani: use your bank ??
[0:31:04] bots_bots: over 100
[0:31:07] bots_bots: total slots
[0:31:08] BadGerbilLion: If you dont have 100 boxes in your bank you are not taking it seriously
[0:31:16] bergy101: speaking of boxes, is power gum in stock?
[0:31:20] ATcaribou: @legend3binderino they made filled boxes not unique on week 2
[0:31:21] loudriantv: bank also have q items
[0:31:23] littlehak: Same
[0:31:26] littlehak: Yeah it's brutal
[0:31:29] limburgse: same
[0:31:30] fivenu: I think it's worth doing now just for teh rep alone, considering you are not up to revered yet
[0:31:31] Valencia_Pete: 10g is oof
[0:31:31] shiggydoo43: how do you feel about being the most handsome wow streamer?
[0:31:31] Eternal_Toaster: @Mind_G0bl1n Taken

[0:31:40] Noilane: i dont buy the 10G i just make another alt
[0:31:42] fivenu: Especially if you have nothing else to prep
[0:31:44] Mind_G0bl1n: @Eternal_Toaster KEKL
[0:31:44] Valencia_Pete: id rather just make a new char to hold shit
[0:31:44] legend3binderino: @ATcaribou ohh ok filled boxes i see, i didnt know that :(
[0:31:46] tyrone710: hard to justify rn
[0:31:48] dtl78: i made 4 bank alts
[0:31:48] littlehak: I'm up to 150g and it's beena  lot of work
[0:31:56] LionetusWoW: are we talking about waylaid
[0:32:06] oasis604: have any investments?

[0:32:47] rubaz1: Like gold confirmed
[0:32:54] limburgse: Questie
[0:32:54] TheEndIsNear777: Staybling confirmed
[0:32:57] dirbagdan: @oasis604 LUL was typing the same thing
[0:33:06] limburgse: idd, Leatrix plus is EPIC
[0:33:12] shiggydoo43: leatrix plus best option is that it disables the blinding glow in barrens and other areas
[0:33:15] authoraborealis: the amount of time you spent farming gold at 25 is way more time lost than what youre going to gain by stacking quests

[0:34:56] NutterCircus: All you need is a screen name.
[0:34:59] ATcaribou: @authoraborealis yep. I’d rather take another day or 2 to hit 40, but have a couple hundred gold from questing.

[0:37:55] dirbagdan: People have become way too comfortable in this day and age with doxxing people and then trying to assert what they think is "justice" for whatever you may have said that bothered their tiny brains
[0:38:01] iknowido: if you can pull 3 you can do it

[0:45:17] divadnothsa: you can pre combine them to save space too
[0:45:31] ATcaribou: everyone had an opinion about what will be good and bad, and it’s a tiny tiny portion of the community who actually understand the game at a deep enough level to actually know. the rest will just wait til those guys figure it out.
[0:45:41] malefic918: Ez clap

[0:48:59] NutterCircus: Depends on who is smoking the cigar.
[0:48:59] bboofit: look more classy
[0:49:05] elrafaelo: Prime Arnold with a cigar = cool af
[0:49:10] evazer0x: cigars have the chode factor
[0:49:14] kasualkaliber: The Godfather > Spike Spiegel
[0:49:25] limburgse: that doesnt sound good :O

[0:51:04] delirious555: BrainSlug
[0:51:06] NutterCircus: Whats everyones fav addon for bags???
[0:51:17] dirbagdan: Cigars are definitely cooler and exude a sense of class. Example: You may be approached by a dude on the street hacking a butt and coughing in your face with every word, but you wont see him with a cigar...
[0:51:48] 125christian125: @dirbagdan just smoke cigarettes be a man
[0:52:06] BadGerbilLion: with prequest/boxes, I highly recommend you store the silk/bolts in mail

[0:53:19] Utmost777: Watermelon for Murlis?
[0:54:04] dirbagdan: @125christian125 I don't really smoke. Just like a cigar every now and then. Sometimes on nice days in the summer I'll whip one out in the truck on the way home like Tony Soprano LUL

[1:05:36] Mawshaw: 10% of a level Peggers
[1:05:43] numblezzz: im waiting for p1 boxes to not give any xp or rep on p2
[1:05:47] biki2112: are we sure its 200?
[1:05:50] Brenno_Mc: are you going to collect 18 WSG tokens to hand in?
[1:05:56] lightkekerino: p2 prep/rush to 40 is too sweaty, wish they raid locked a week Sadge
[1:05:57] sunguyyy: I think jerome has 250 boxes haha
[1:06:02] feistygoat37: At honored with the Supply rep you get a 12 slot bag. What do you get at Revered? No one knows.
[1:06:03] doxthefox89: @StaysafeTV and have you liked Horde more or less than Ally?
[1:06:14] wookinit: its probably way less than 200 thats my guess tho
[1:06:19] RustedSkin: the boxes prep just reminds me of fishing prep in tbc that got hotfixed. big waste of time. But at least something to do if bored i guess?!?
[1:06:20] drvichyssoise: theyre purging your mailbox

[1:08:40] sycaway: so complicated kek Peggers
[1:09:30] limburgse: you really gonna hit 40 in 1 sitting?
[1:09:39] numblezzz: i feel like its more likely the blue post misspoke than them allowing resetting p1 stuff a day late
[1:09:46] abdarahyin: Phase 2 hype is real
[1:10:02] punkypex: and why they purged mailbox? if we can still farm
[1:10:02] Dmaceee: how much does mark quest give?
[1:10:12] gambleragain: how much xp is one mark turn in?
[1:10:13] NutterCircus: That basically means, dont have anything in your mailbox because their code isnt ironclad.
[1:10:19] googz_ow: @staysafetv can’t you farm enough marks to sit in your backpack before that on the 6th. then farm what you are talking about to go in the mailbox
[1:10:30] limburgse: that will take 30ish hours isnt it?

[1:15:37] numblezzz: staysafe gym will implement a fatty arena, where all the fatties will be locked into an arena to brawl until they either die or lose 50 lb
[1:15:43] g0dzilla: i think there will be new boxes wich give more xp... but the old ones dont
[1:15:54] Effen13: It's a damn shame!
[1:16:23] Brenno_Mc: I wonder if there will be more rep rewards for the boxes
[1:16:29] moobiez: Jerome has 250 boxes racked up
[1:16:33] grylz89: How do you feel about warlocks heading Into p2? Specifically dps wise in gnomer. Think fire will still dominate?

[1:17:33] wookinit: yea hes wasted a bunch of gold imo
[1:17:39] numblezzz: im a noob, i thought u could only restore 1 iterm like every 30 days?
[1:17:40] yaybump: cannot item restore any quest items
[1:17:43] handpickedbytim: PepeLaugh oh no no no
[1:17:44] sk3pnad: They fixed that months ago, you can't restore them
[1:17:44] whitenoise407: Putitng in a 'suggestion' now kekw
[1:17:46] yaybump: So rip his idea lmao
[1:17:47] aBradAbroad: @moobiez no he doesnt, he has like 40
[1:17:51] aBradAbroad: his goal with 250
[1:17:52] wookinit: greys is on the way to spend 700g on filling his boxes KEKW
[1:17:58] ATcaribou: @yaybump yeah you can, for now. it worked last week when he tried
[1:17:59] aerodynam1c: any boxers
[1:17:59] dtl78: he said "high risk high reward"
[1:18:05] dispensaryttv: @sk3pnad you can restore filled boxes
[1:18:17] Mahca_: i just got enough to get honored instantly plus the small amount of xp
[1:18:23] wookinit: thats jsut what he said in his stream
[1:18:45] numblezzz: ninja it peepoRun
[1:18:46] ATcaribou: he said that becuase he pays for 2 75s summons every time he needs to go back to town

[1:19:06] sk3pnad: @dispensaryttv Oh ok, never tried that.

[1:19:38] DrazonTV: how was phase 1? better or worse than expected?
[1:19:42] sk3pnad: Would it not be safe to assume that at level 26 the old boxes give no exp anymore tho?
[1:19:45] aBradAbroad: did you see the updated loot tables for SM?
[1:19:49] NutterCircus: You know why they are getting rid of Master Loot, they cant call it anything else. KEKL
[1:19:52] Mahca_: thoughts on the new dungeon gear?
[1:19:54] berhananapina: abrad where
[1:19:56] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV hey bro
[1:20:04] numblezzz: crusader lore is honestly based af. combination of medieval crusaders + zombie apocalypse, trying to reclaim the post apocalypse human lands
[1:20:12] ATcaribou: i have never had this much fun in WoW. ive raided every lockout since week 2. its bveen a blast
[1:20:17] limburgse: alot of peeps took a break a month aho
[1:20:18] cyonara74: phase 1 is for making alts
[1:20:19] littlehak: YEP
[1:20:21] TheEndIsNear777: servers went from Full to high
[1:20:23] shadypanda007: The pvp sucks cause you cant solo que WSG
[1:20:36] photicz_: @StaysafeTV Homie of mine thinks SM won't be available as a dungeon because they "teased it at blizzcon" so he thinks it'll be reserved as a raid until 50. Is he a regard?
[1:20:46] johnnypoison69: 25 cap was great for alts and trying new classes
[1:20:51] SuperLost89: ive been raid logging for about 3 weeks now
[1:20:53] gressil1234: no point leveling alts since GDKP banned
[1:21:06] bongwaterfacewash: I started dragonflight
[1:21:07] Mahca_: @photicz_ there was new gear datamined for sm so dungeons are probably available
[1:21:13] numblezzz: i hit 25 and quit instantly. but i basically only like arena in end game
[1:21:16] msfugsly: i have 3 bis characters and ive never done a gdkp
[1:21:18] cyonara74: i raid on 4 alts each reset
[1:21:18] aBradAbroad: @gressil1234 KEKW what?
[1:21:19] CommanderDog: Gee Day Kay Pay
[1:21:25] ATcaribou: i saw alot of people on reddit say "i cleared the raid a couple of times and ran out of stuff to do"... thats just now how i view the game at all
[1:21:33] SuperLost89: @gressil1234 sucks to be you
[1:21:40] grumpybearsx: Yo Stay what addon is it that extends your quest log ?
[1:21:46] sircrumpler: Do you miss alliance at all?
[1:21:46] bottlekiddz: im so pumped for phase 2, cant wait to play a two handed shaman and not be a gimp
[1:21:47] PazokiTV: if you rely on your mom's credit card to get loot in a 20 year old game then you're a loser LUL
[1:22:02] g0dzilla: @StaysafeTV what do you think how much time it needs to lvl from 25 to 40 in 1 sitting and dungeon spamming? 30hr?
[1:22:02] Nickrondis: I agree, GDKP was the main reason i had alts. I dont take them on guild runs, and i hate not getting gear due to RNG. At least with GDKP, i get gold for my trouble.
[1:22:04] SuperLost89: i wonder how much money people make by selling their gold doing gdkps
[1:22:07] glestytv: We miss you

[1:22:20] numblezzz: me and my bois decided to try horde for sod. god damn, the smell alone makes me wanna switch back
[1:22:31] NutterCircus: I miss killing my gnome mage in fun and creative ways.
[1:22:43] Slaabbb: do you miss people wearing shoes
[1:22:47] sircrumpler: It's classical fantasy elements
[1:22:47] cyonara74: what are you doing in wc?
[1:22:48] iknowido: way more white
[1:22:49] h2h_nillz: I went alliance this time but i miss horde
[1:22:53] numblezzz: castles and not poop huts YEP
[1:22:55] DrazonTV: what do you like and dislike with the horde so far?
[1:22:56] gryphsx: you dont like living in a mud hut ? Kappa
[1:22:56] apoc712: Horde: OOGA BOOGA DINGA DONGA
[1:23:00] msfugsly: the smells of orgrimmar
[1:23:00] 4wardsjack: the horde is more like 3rd world
[1:23:09] punkypex: horde like afrika
[1:23:15] 4wardsjack: but someone has to play horde so normies can play alliance
[1:23:19] elrafaelo: What do you think about Hordes Zepps vs. Alliance boats / trains ? :D
[1:23:27] berhananapina: @aBradAbroad where is the loot tables?
[1:23:29] kalex214: horde have tent cities like Portland
[1:23:30] father_ruckus_: Alliance is like the suburbs,  horde is that wafflehouse on the other side of the tracks
[1:23:48] sircrumpler: Thunder bluff and UC are def cooler, sucks org will be the main city
[1:23:51] msfugsly: horde poop in the streets
[1:23:53] g0dzilla: @4wardsjack i wouldnt call myself a normie... but ill take that as a compliment, so thx ^^
[1:23:58] Slaabbb: just say orcs smell bad
[1:24:07] old_old_old_doug: alliance are weenies
[1:24:18] g0dzilla: @father_ruckus_ why is that?
[1:24:18] numblezzz: orcs are only 13% of the population but commit 50% of lowbie ganking
[1:24:20] elrafaelo: I've played Horde as 60 and Alliance as 60,  I got triggerd about how much longer it takes for Alliance to travel the world
[1:24:26] Loufalah: Loufalah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:24:34] g0dzilla: @old_old_old_doug why is that??
[1:24:37] elrafaelo: Alliance player to travel to Silithus, takes like 30 mins
[1:24:43] AngusOfCapeBreton: Imagine the smell
[1:24:46] Slaabbb: drugs probably
[1:25:08] 4wardsjack: probably because there was too much time between expansions
[1:25:21] DrazonTV: what is your expectations for p2?
[1:25:44] aerodynam1c: arathi basin PepeWhite
[1:25:44] g0dzilla: @DrazonTV fun should be everything...
[1:25:44] 4wardsjack: can i join your group just for glowing shard?
[1:25:58] NutterCircus: AB Premades EleGiggle
[1:26:00] AaahhRealAliens: just watched smells of org that shit was hilarious lmaooo
[1:26:04] windatar: Arathi Basin is my fav Battle ground.
[1:26:09] aerodynam1c: you get the actual cool tabard with ab exalted now that youre horde too
[1:26:37] lizcat_: gnomer sucks
[1:26:39] numblezzz: 10 man was a lame choice
[1:26:41] Lionkingler1: big true
[1:26:43] Slaabbb: why
[1:26:43] NutterCircus: Same
[1:26:46] 4wardsjack: my expectations for gnomer and the loot is pretty low
[1:26:52] sweatlordkush: gnomer should be 40 man
[1:26:55] g0dzilla: gnomer is going to be fun the first 5 lockouts... after that, same then bfd
[1:27:00] reefo: it'll be 10 all the way up
[1:27:01] bots_bots: would impact most casual players and guilds having to combien and shit tho for 20 mans
[1:27:03] Slaabbb: imagine having friends
[1:27:04] sircrumpler: I don't understand why they can't adjust the size of the raid in the next phase down to 10 when they even glotted about having the technology to adjust things
[1:27:07] BobLongMVP: agreed
[1:27:07] reefo: 20 at 60
[1:27:13] numblezzz: im assuming they kept it at 10 man so its actually still possible to due in future phases
[1:27:13] bots_bots: they probably holding off on 20 mans till 60
[1:27:16] NutterCircus: 20 People means higher probability of FUN. EleGiggle
[1:27:20] numblezzz: to do*
[1:27:27] Alastree: I agree
[1:27:30] aerodynam1c: i havent talked to half the officers in my guild because of 10 man
[1:27:39] Germond: That's how it's always gonna be in this meta gamed version of what used to be
[1:27:43] DrazonTV: we need 80 man raid grp lets go
[1:27:48] Dorias1: meet up with 9 ppl and wipe 4 hours
[1:27:51] elrafaelo: @StaysafeTV Will you play Hardcore Solo self-found / try it out ?
[1:27:54] SuperLost89: like what? HUH
[1:27:57] sircrumpler: They even said in the blizzcon interview they have the tech to easily adjust size
[1:28:00] Slaabbb: heard that before
[1:28:12] elrafaelo: fair
[1:28:52] handpickedbytim: what about dragonflight season 3 though????
[1:28:52] googz_ow: will you ever apply zoneman to SOD?
[1:28:58] Wingsofjanitor: raid-log in SoD, level in self-found when you have rested XP NODDERS
[1:28:59] NutterCircus: Ill never forget running heroics on my gnome mage naked because I needed gold to buy back my gear. FeelsStrongMan
[1:29:11] windatar: They should have attempted Gnomer with their flex system, if you wanted 20 mans you can but if you want only 10 mans you can. Keep the same loot for both but give a rep payout or gold payout at the end of 20 man if you finish it so you don't create two tiers of loot.
[1:29:15] ClinxyWow: wc trash is harder than bfd trash
[1:29:58] numblezzz: the QoL items dropping from 5 mans NODDERS
[1:30:05] ClinxyWow: THE WORLDBOSS IN STV
[1:30:11] m0ggi: What do you think about flex raids in classic
[1:30:14] windatar: I can see Aggrends reason for not making it ten man though, they want people running these dungeons to level up and finding 20 random pugs while leveling would probably be a huge bitch.
[1:30:22] g0dzilla: @windatar i think its pretty hard to balance a raid for 10 and/or 20 man raids...
[1:30:26] cloudstrife543: ya its gonna get freaky at 60
[1:30:28] Lionkingler1: engi belt is naxx bis
[1:30:32] ATcaribou: thats fine. i think they fully redesign the 60 raids
[1:30:33] wookinit: i hope they make lvl 60 dung super hard
[1:30:38] spleen_eater: yes
[1:30:42] reefo: it'll be scaled up i think
[1:30:44] 4wardsjack: hopefully
[1:30:45] gryphsx: basically
[1:30:45] cloudstrife543: its gonna be so messy
[1:30:47] 4wardsjack: thats more fun
[1:30:49] old_old_old_doug: POWER CREEP!
[1:30:51] windatar: I mean, they're already doing mass changes to current loot.
[1:30:51] neosenpai69: do u think people getting upset about getting wrath talents instead of new ones is fair? saw a bunch of people bitching about feral getting berserk
[1:30:52] fuzeb0x_: naxx gear is going to be fuckin insane
[1:30:52] ATcaribou: i dont think they just buff. full redesign i thnik like we had with bfd
[1:30:57] bottlekiddz: buff sulfurs thats all i want in life
[1:30:57] ClinxyWow: buff hand of rag! it gets replaced by BWL

[1:31:03] Lionkingler1: running into hard caps Peggers
[1:31:06] Vivwpf: Has anyone told you that you sort of sound like seth rogan?
[1:31:08] numblezzz: i think its fine. let the itemization go crazy along with increased difficulty
[1:31:08] madgarlicjr: i don't think the old lvl 60 raids are going to be a big part of sod, just side content
[1:31:12] Chaboi_Twill: they already changed caster gear in SM to have SP, i guess they will do the same for later dungeons
[1:31:15] numblezzz: better than stagnating on the same classic shit
[1:31:16] reefo: maybe they continue this trend of augmenting the raids
[1:31:17] g0dzilla: @wookinit they wont... its classic... if you want to get hard raids, you need to play retail... thats what ive heared alot
[1:31:18] cloudstrife543: ive accepted that its just going to be wildly different, and im along for the ride to see how it plays out
[1:31:22] DrazonTV: I doubt any loot table at 60 will stay the same
[1:31:23] sircrumpler: I do feel like they sent a bit too crazy on the numbers personally but we'll see

[1:33:41] carlos_the_7th: Isn't there like signs with "no soliciting" all around the USA?
[1:33:45] g0dzilla: @wookinit ofc they will adjust the difficulty compared to gear and player number... but they wont add to much mechanics i guess...
[1:33:51] NutterCircus: Gota love when they says they are'nt selling anything EleGiggle
[1:33:56] numblezzz: in highschool football, they made us sell shit door to door to pay for our jerseys and shit. absolutely terrible

[1:37:37] MarcoFlee: maybe don't break into homes and you won't be shot
[1:37:39] BladeTV: Dont forget that the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the pathsays up to your front door, while private, are able to be used by public and police if they come to knock on your door. Now you have the right to tell them to leave, and then they must do so, but they can initially come up to knock
[1:37:43] carlos_the_7th: @divadnothsa fuck them, their problem not yours
[1:37:43] wookinit: @divadnothsa then they chose the wrong fucking house
[1:37:48] Highkriger: ''chill'' he says KEKL

[1:40:43] g0dzilla: couldnt think about anything worse then that
[1:40:48] cleannjerkk: onlyt box from lvl 25-40

[1:42:18] Paddyearl42: I will use that on my lib friends
[1:42:18] reavethederp: the best arguement i've heard for owning a gun is if you live on a farm or in the midle of nowhere, where police cant respond
[1:42:22] hart_mk1: and hopefully you never have to use your firearm for self-defence
[1:42:23] Etny2k: how many times have you licked to the center of a lollipop

[1:42:38] neosenpai69: i will never understand europeans willingly letting themselves be unable to defend themselves maybe im ignorant but its just so strange that u cant defend ur home
[1:42:41] numblezzz: @reavethederp a man has a right to defend himself against potential threats. all the logic that is needed
[1:43:02] unscconnor2: People act like buying guns means you intend to actually use them, you hope to never want to be in a situation where you have to use your firearm unless you are at a range or hunting

[1:43:29] Slaabbb: @Smokjoker depends on what kind but not deadly ones
[1:43:30] erawin1990: if it cant severly injure then no
[1:43:33] Paddyearl42: what about how deadly guns have gotten compared to when the founding fathers created the 2A
[1:43:38] carlos_the_7th: @englishurza bait

[1:43:42] cainelol: Do you think the founding fathers would have written that if they new assault rifles woulkd exist
[1:43:45] g0dzilla: @dave3ooo, at first, im preventing getting robbed... by locking my doors, my windows etc... second, it doesnt happen alot in germany... didnt happen in the last 28 years and i bet it will never happen... if it happens, he can take everything besides my life... i dont care about my tv or my pc... my life is more worth...

[1:44:20] Lionkingler1: what about civil war?
[1:44:27] persistentplatypus: the vast majority of home robberies in the us happen during the daytime hours (10am-3pm) when no one is home with a gun, in england the stat is reversed
[1:44:33] rinderwahn63: yep ar-15 vs fighter jets will work :DDD

[1:45:00] chinchopaaaaaaaa: hey buddy , hope u are having a great time
[1:45:05] Phalloides60: fighter jets have pilots who have families that live in homes off base
[1:45:05] numblezzz: @persistentplatypus hence being an armed home owner is a good repellant
[1:45:06] FatMcafee: guerilla warfare is a real thing
[1:45:07] bone555: The USSR too
[1:45:08] cloudstrife543: they arent fighter jetting the entire country

[1:45:42] flaruen: yes , missle strike on your own land usually goes over well with the population
[1:45:45] bboofit: to be fair they just needed to outlast us not take ground

[1:46:36] g0dzilla: @msfugsly history sucks... there were alot of issues in the past we could do better... care more about the future... cause thats the stuff we need to take care of... cant change the past
[1:46:38] fake_based: @StaysafeTV do you understand the kill ratio of our military vs. the taliban?

[1:46:52] Youtube_Historian: Mountains > Bombs
[1:46:54] unscconnor2: Using force on your own citizens isnt a very popular thing here in the US, look at why Biden hasnt done anything with Texas so far. To think the US military will obey to attack their own lands is insance to me
[1:46:58] bboofit: alternatively one very determined' man with a 308
[1:46:58] ClinxyWow: @sound_wayv lmao. okay so youre clueless

[1:47:52] NutterCircus: When they carpet Bombed Germany, they did it because they knew most of the population would be a problem.
[1:47:53] numblezzz: there should be a tier of guilt above "reasonable without reasonable doubt" such as confession, video proof, etc

[1:49:02] bone555: Murlis did that???
[1:49:06] MarcoFlee: it was fucked
[1:49:08] dreadd39: imo i think death penalty is deserving for peds and mass murderers. sure letting them rot in solitary seems just but id rather erase them and their memory of existing from history

[1:49:33] Highkriger: no way a fed would be done like that KEKL
[1:49:37] numblezzz: most of what he was claiming was typical right wing shit "fuck the woke, blm, feds, etc" but ofc he was insane and chopped off a head

[1:50:14] g0dzilla: i dont understand the deathsentence... do you rly think its a punishment for such a guy? i think he actually would love to get that... so he doesnt have to suffer from beeing locked in etc
[1:50:27] ongtehjem: wanted to try power gum but doesnt ship to asia sadly
[1:50:31] divadnothsa: i found a place with good drop rates on the high box, was the wyverns on high peak i got a few drops and all were the  25 lvl ones

[1:50:38] Mind_G0bl1n: @g0dzilla they should confine him to playing retail wow BGs

[1:51:00] Probulator: dont want to pay taxes to keep them alive
[1:51:04] Mind_G0bl1n: not reflect, to punish him more than death
[1:51:06] windatar: @StaysafeTV If they were going to die anyway, what are your thoughts on organ harvesting before their death to save other people needing them?
[1:51:06] englishurza: but wrongly accused tho
[1:51:07] numblezzz: torture people like that to warn others YEP

[1:51:27] englishurza: like some people racist and send people to death
[1:51:31] Mind_G0bl1n: punishment worse than death to discourage others from doing similar
[1:51:32] persistentplatypus: 40-50k is on the low end
[1:51:32] Taicho116: As long as it doesn't end up like the guy in idaho this summer 73 years old 50 years in prison + millions in court fees.
[1:51:35] Varren__: make them do labor to re-coop cost lol

[2:00:11] littlehak: People are gonna upcharge the mats for boxes above 25 like crazy
[2:00:20] ATcaribou: for any alliance who want to do boxes, rethban cavern in redridge and the gnoll camps around there are fantastic. had 12 boxes in 2 hours
[2:00:25] Slapppped: okay
[2:00:29] cleannjerkk: Bael modan drop rate is insane
[2:00:31] neosenpai69: what is the purpose of a box? just rep and xp?

[2:01:24] elvenrage: what if there was a rune, say for your legs, that gave you an chance to learn a 3rd profession, would you use it?
[2:01:24] Brenno_Mc: the gold farmed here just pays for the boxes to be filled
[2:01:27] ATcaribou: @g0dzilla and there are so many tin nodes in there. made decent gold while farming boxes
[2:01:28] englishurza: do you want new raid a little harder?

[2:02:02] Tobsadud5: The dungeon gear getting buffed? Nice!
[2:02:09] Steamro11r: looks like just caster gear getting the buffs
[2:02:11] VideoRunner: Been away from the wow scene in a bit. What's fresh?
[2:02:13] windatar: Caster loot is getting massive changes, nearly everything is getting spell power or element damage.
[2:02:22] msfugsly: my guild is gonna do a test run of bfd the second we log in
[2:02:23] N_Tys: hearing a rumour that CDL will be coming back at lvl 40 👀
[2:02:29] AxelFromAustralia: is 25-40 longer than 1-25 leveling staysafe?
[2:02:39] Vazini: evening chat evening dude! Saw your clip on swatter. Glad he got caught. hope all goes the best for you and other victims and justice for him
[2:02:40] Brenno_Mc: they've tuned the old gear to use more spell/heal power rather than stats for casters
[2:02:40] windatar: CDL?
[2:02:41] englishurza: CDL?
[2:02:41] g0dzilla: @TheEyeVII oh alot of player will come back i bet... even new player starting aswell since 1-25 is getting a 50%xp boost
[2:02:41] jindobd: I wish Gnomer were a bigger raid. Something about 10 mans isn't as exciting as even 25 mans not to mention 40
[2:02:43] dj_clerik: @StaysafeTV what if they stealth buff dungeon difficulty like they did with the outside world in P1? Does that change your lvling plans?
[2:02:44] relyt1981: what is cdl?
[2:02:55] windatar: Ah, gotcha
[2:02:55] NateTheGreatish: NateTheGreatish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Holy hell. 1 year of being based.
[2:03:04] ClinxyWow: hey guys tipsout here
[2:03:06] catbalou2: Do you think the warning about raid groups in the PVP event will be a nasty debuff
[2:03:15] carlos_the_7th: Reddit has highlighted the arrest of Alan Winston Filion KEKW
[2:03:16] Tobsadud5: Yeah true LVL 40 a lot of classes get their main spells
[2:03:26] windatar: Weren't there also living flame healing nerfs planned so that mages can't do WC boosts as easy as before?
[2:03:37] englishurza: in stv we can till 5 man? like can you heal a party member?
[2:03:43] cloudstrife543: new zone? i didnt hear about that
[2:03:49] TheEyeVII: @g0dzilla highly doubt "new players" will but ya returning players for sure, but for sure fewer than p1 imo
[2:03:50] ClinxyWow: searing basin grasp
[2:03:52] QuestFor420: they said they were putting troll shit in the mix too
[2:03:56] fake_based: Sounds like tank lock will be all of the top 128 of CDL
[2:04:01] yuckil: so is this classic 2.0 or
[2:04:04] yuckil: not rly
[2:04:04] g0dzilla: @dj_clerik doubt it... p1 and p2 are 2 diffrent things... p2 has to be easy cause we had 2 month to farm bfd gear...
[2:04:05] sircrumpler: Maybe for leveling content?
[2:04:09] QuestFor420: probably a troll imo
[2:04:16] sircrumpler: 40-60 gets so dry with quests
[2:04:19] windatar: Searing basin? Is there any land around blackrock area not used?
[2:04:22] Eepingmoo: it’s season of data mining
[2:04:24] dj_clerik: @StaysafeTV any chance they're going to make the 25-40 dungeons harder along with the loot changes?
[2:04:25] Tobsadud5: I see SOD as the beta test for classic+
[2:04:27] Steamro11r: dont know why they only make pally buffs 10 min and making all other buffs 45min
[2:04:33] h2h_nillz: Where would it be?
[2:04:47] Smokjoker: do you think there will be new raids that were removed from orignal classic? @StaysafeTV
[2:04:50] g0dzilla: @Steamro11r where did you get this info?
[2:04:53] TheEyeVII: @g0dzilla oh ya it's gonna be a joke to level 25 to 40 with epic broken gear and runes, dung spam is gonna be bis
[2:04:56] msfugsly: i feel like they ninja nerfed redridge ive gotten 0 boxes from 5 chests so far
[2:05:10] QuestFor420: would be nice tho
[2:05:12] iMadBandit: iMadBandit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[2:05:13] ATcaribou: @msfugsly nah its still great. did it earlier 12 boxes in less than 2 hours
[2:05:18] windatar: @Steamro11r They're making pally buffs last 100% longer and 50% less, not just making pally buffs 10 minutes, but when they get greater blessings that 15 will turn into 30. Keep in mind.
[2:05:44] tampaESPORTS: Michael Knowles on the whatever podcast rn lol not who i expected to see as a guest
[2:05:50] g0dzilla: @TheEyeVII best you could do, start a new char from lvl1 so you get some difficulty
[2:05:56] Steamro11r: wowhead datamine books increase blessing duratrion by 100% books for other classes extend by 50%
[2:05:58] Roccobro: @StaysafeTV are you moving soon?
[2:06:07] scoobusdoobus: don't we all just want a box
[2:06:10] Steamro11r: but 100% of 5 min only 10 min
[2:06:11] bboofit: Layer for chests?

[2:37:53] Plathyy: @chinchopaaaaaaaa its technically chicken period
[2:37:58] manaisbetter: oh oh sorry
[2:37:58] Utmost777: did you hear about the conspiracy about the chicken feed a few years ago? People thought the feed from stores was preventing them from laying
[2:38:02] sircrumpler: People all over the west coast have chickens in cities, I've seen it all over
[2:38:05] EarSlug: jersey giants are great
[2:38:06] running_backing: what if you give your chicken a PCR test then you have to kill like 200 million of them
[2:38:06] Raewhen: Hens
[2:38:11] candll: its all fun and games until you actually have to chop a head of your chicken for meat
[2:38:13] manaisbetter: makes sense
[2:38:17] dmcveigh1: How do you inseminate your chickens to replnish your stock?
[2:38:22] LoRswat: most city ordinances allow up to 3 chickens....some allow a few more
[2:38:27] yaybump: I live in portland, yopu must be in like vancouver/longview area
[2:38:31] savagelo256: my neighbor has a roster and it’s kinda cool hearing that during the morning coffee
[2:38:32] gororororoo: raccoons will kill your chickens too and wont even eat them. nasty fckers
[2:38:36] numblezzz: @candll gordon ramsay did a pretty based thing with his family. had his kids raised turkeys but come to terms with killing them for food
[2:38:42] Rosindogg: bill gates is a large owner of a lot of chicle farms now isn’t he
[2:38:42] dirbagdan: I ate this thing in the Philippines called Balut. lol that was wild
[2:38:44] yuckil: so hens wont get weird if thers no rooster
[2:38:50] gororororoo: gotta make sure their coop is locked down tight
[2:38:54] sothis666: you can have a rooster, but you gotta put a silencer on them pepeSmoke
[2:38:57] sirdreadeye: at least 3 days
[2:38:59] Juubbz: If you get bees it can reduce your property tax to almost nothing each year. Not sure if its that way in the US tho
[2:39:02] iBanEvader: @savagelo256 waking up to a rooster is the best feeling
[2:39:05] xxbuzx: I live in Puyallup Washington and I know tons of people with chickens lol
[2:39:08] manaisbetter: till you eat it
[2:39:10] russkeiii: until i say so
[2:39:14] divadnothsa: but you eat them when they stop makign eggs
[2:39:17] holdenwook: 12 years if you feed them weed
[2:39:20] Dewzi: Sooo relax buddy with ur axe :D  :D :D
[2:39:28] fart_boiii: in chicken coupes they live for 6 months
[2:39:32] numblezzz: my family has been in PNW for generations. always had chickens in the backyard, i hope to bring back the tradition soon
[2:39:40] EarSlug: just have to keep other things from eating them lol, hawks minks and snakes love em
[2:39:41] Raewhen: But their productivity drops significantly after about 3 years. Most egg producers will harvest them at their first mold when they stop producing for a while.
[2:39:46] Raewhen: molt*
[2:39:54] xxbuzx: oh nice, I own some property in Morton my family and I camp at!
[2:40:04] lightkekerino: do eggs come from asshole?

[2:40:31] fitzpajo: the cost of raising chickens is more expensive then eggs tho..
[2:40:31] Mawshaw: Okay they actually do though KEKL
[2:40:34] iBanEvader: also there's a lot of difference in eggs
[2:40:36] yuckil: make an egg side hustle Pog

[2:40:48] Torio150: aneen indigenecauz, goween neen buckaday, miigwiitch niij

[2:40:55] mazian4: Eggs are good for your prostate
[2:40:56] bigdubsss: i thought chickens dont poop cause they're female @StaysafeTV
[2:41:02] IR_ish: that is pretty good though
[2:41:05] IR_ish: more eggs better
[2:41:08] BigChonq: THE CHICKEN BUTTHOLE IS CALLED A CLOACA
[2:41:08] CrixVibez: Fcuking love eggs
[2:41:08] Maxifrog: That's okay
[2:41:13] ClinxyWow: but would you consider yourself an egger?
[2:41:13] Rosindogg: you could also raise ducks instead  if the noise is a problem

[2:41:39] Torio150: How many chickens would i take to sustain your lifestyle?
[2:41:41] Brightleaf: eggs and beef tallow so good
[2:41:43] re5onxnce: have you ever tried Balut
[2:41:59] Mawshaw: pepeP
[2:42:00] Metaphix: that shit looks gross
[2:42:06] numblezzz: im willing to try most things, i will never try balut
[2:42:21] Torio150: viet akshually

[2:42:52] go00se: evening
[2:42:58] Raewhen: @Torio150 supprisingly not that many for most people. Commercial breeds lay 300 eggs per year, almost one per day. Heritage breeds of chicken tend to lay closer to 250 eggs per year. Its still a lot.
[2:42:58] Krabue: 1,5 g
[2:43:04] Metaphix: saw jellied camel hooves on a weird foods show it's chinese apprently

[2:43:39] RanciusAdventures: @staysafetv posted a few pics of the chicken starting process. it’s an easy 6 month process
[2:43:45] dmcveigh1: Have you thought about backyard Tilapia farming since you are into homesteading?
[2:43:48] Raewhen: @numblezzz Hooves are made of the same protein your fingernails are made of
[2:43:55] iBanEvader: @numblezzz hooves are keratine probably
[2:44:04] numblezzz: i mean like the inside, not the nail part

[2:45:25] frognite: what about easter rabbits?
[2:45:26] fake_based: They do breed fast tho
[2:45:26] wookinit: fur and meat
[2:45:26] yuckil: rabbit eggs

[2:45:29] Slaanesh74: rabbits breed pretty fast
[2:45:33] Mungtime: rabbit milk
[2:45:33] go00se: rabbit foot
[2:45:36] plddn: lol i thought about we need rabbit breeding just to feed cyotee
[2:45:37] dispensaryttv: not as fast as chickens tho
[2:45:39] zealofsteel: just eat the rabbit eggs
[2:45:40] wookinit: yea 3 months max
[2:45:42] RanciusAdventures: wife wanted to try goats 🐐 but fuck that
[2:45:45] exnihilo777: never ate rabbit
[2:45:49] Valencia_Pete: i raised rabbits for a couple years
[2:45:51] Raewhen: that is how any meat animal is. Beef cattle are the same way. you arent extracting any dollar value until you harvest.
[2:45:52] LemoNToweL: fuck goat?
[2:45:52] dumani542: chicken are a life hack...they lay eggs just by getting fed, they dont need a rooster do  they ?

[2:46:15] LemoNToweL: he said it not me
[2:46:22] kaiju_kin: so lean
[2:46:23] dispensaryttv: @dumani542 only to fertalize them, hens lay an egg per day
[2:46:23] fake_based: too expensive to scale
[2:46:24] TurboBased: Rabbit is good
[2:46:25] IR_ish: you can't get it everywhere easily

[2:46:32] IR_ish: at least not here
[2:46:32] Valencia_Pete: or anyone with high cholesterol
[2:46:43] sothis666: bunnies being cute doesn't absolve them of being delicious
[2:46:47] Slaanesh74: if it's not slaughtered and drained quickly it has a gamey taste
[2:46:50] Milanesa_De_Pollo: What about having a cricket farm?
[2:46:51] Raewhen: Fun figure. For rabbits. One buck and three doe rabbits can produce as many pounds of meat in one year as raising one beef steer in the same time frame.
[2:46:57] IR_ish: you can find duck, and chicken, but you would be hard pressed to find anything else
[2:47:05] jindobd: LMFAO
[2:47:06] ryufromstreets6: had a rabbit when growing up, makes me a bitch and not really want to eat rabbit meat

[2:48:39] windatar: Bear meat and Wolf meat are worm/parasite infested.
[2:48:39] Tomoglaziat: Bear meat tastes like what its eating at the time
[2:48:41] AxelFromAustralia: walk outside and shoot a bear. when it’s eating your trash
[2:48:42] gororororoo: any carnivore is full of parasites since they scavenge a bunch of dead shit
[2:48:44] Raewhen: I have never had bear, but I have read accounts of people that did and general concensus is that bear meat tastes terrible
[2:48:47] itzblomster: if you saw worms in meat would you cook it and eat it?
[2:48:48] Metaphix: gross
[2:48:51] wookinit: i was raised on wild hog and deer
[2:48:53] go00se: blueberry bear
[2:48:57] AaahhRealAliens: you cant do that
[2:49:01] lagginginironforge: If its cooked it has no danger no?
[2:49:02] h2h_nillz: theres different types of bear meat. it taste differnt depending on what they eat. if its main diet is Berries, Fish, Other mammals etc
[2:49:08] Metaphix: any kind of raw meat is nasty except maybe sushi/sashimi

[3:30:05] Sheldorisafk: lol
[3:30:06] Holsch3r: O.O
[3:30:08] bigwank69: I appreciate how based to the absolute max you are
[3:30:08] R3ga1: I dont get it, it looks childish and put together so loosely
[3:30:12] Mauraderss: misogynists play palworld
[3:30:13] revora_: Racist for sure yeah graycenStare
[3:30:17] numblezzz: @OhMyMookie 100%, wasting hundreds of hours on basic assets is just a waste of time if AI can do it for you
[3:30:18] VegaCP: They estimate they've surpassed 500m in sales
[3:30:18] Haziosaka: AI arts are still created by artists
[3:30:19] plddn: is palworld running on fortnite engine
[3:30:23] Raewhen: hasnt palworld sold like... millions of copies now?
[3:30:23] Mimentu: @StaysafeTV i already bought it. you don't have to sell it to me anymore.
[3:30:31] sircrumpler: You support slavery
[3:30:31] closetothebeach: or just a follow the crowd..
[3:30:34] jonv0: prob pro biden
[3:30:39] thebedshow: It's weird that people care so much about AI but don't complain about code compilers or software that massively speeds up the design process. Why not just cry until everyone has to write in binary and has to hand draw every frame? Luddite to the max
[3:30:39] sircrumpler: Cuz pals have no rights
[3:30:39] hvaqice2200: even weebs would not toutch that game
[3:30:40] xxlegitghostxx: tell ‘em staysafe 😂😂
[3:30:43] Robbtuck: probably gay
[3:30:50] trebolz: you should play league on stream KEKW
[3:30:55] stevodruid: have you tried the cave at the top of barrens?
[3:30:56] numblezzz: @thebedshow yup exactly
[3:30:57] scelero: If humans made AI, why not credit the humans who made it for the artwork.
[3:30:59] Sheldorisafk: or SoD is simply your game rn
[3:31:28] ironbull007: any reason your banking them and not turning them in now?
[3:31:29] MrPink604: what made you change your mind on farming boxes when i asked you yesterday you said it didn't seem worth
[3:31:38] Tayroar_: Can you explain quickly what you're doing right now? just farming chests?
[3:31:42] VegaCP: @trebolz didn't he do that a long time ago
[3:31:44] mangotrance: how many you have
[3:31:48] thebedshow: With your plan do you think you will hit 26+?
[3:31:50] unscconnor2: this spot is closer to a fp than the cave up north
[3:31:53] trebolz: @VegaCP YEP
[3:31:53] Plokoon100: yo

[3:33:21] vk_jp: are we certain these boxes are going to reward exp?
[3:33:26] blowoutsale: world first lv 28 @StaysafeTV
[3:33:41] Sebbeehr: they remove wsg marks on launch right?
[3:33:43] Plokoon100: didn’t they say there were gonna delete wsg tokens when phase 2 comes up in a blue post?
[3:33:53] windatar: Hit revered and that will be one of the new runes as well probably.
[3:33:55] WHOisROXIS: i think the boxes are capped at honored
[3:33:59] thebedshow: might only give rep on new boxes though like how lower boxes stop after friendly
[3:34:08] numblezzz: @beblar ive been asking the same
[3:34:20] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[3:34:24] Plokoon100: Susge hmm
[3:34:27] windatar: Capped at honored for phase 1, they're going to open it to revered phase 2
[3:34:42] r_kramerz: probably been asked 20k + times, thoughts on Phase 2 lock and the runes? Will they be viable, S tier? Or just straight garbage.
[3:35:18] windatar: Almost no point on thinking about Runes when we don't know which ones were real and which ones were fake besides the ones they teased.
[3:35:44] aionos: 5Head
[3:36:22] sircrumpler: Fuck org
[3:36:23] boxhead66: Will you level off those quests?
[3:36:24] keelew: Im such a casual compared to this LUL
[3:36:33] thebedshow: what about a bfd run?
[3:36:33] boxhead66: if so you might want to train lvl 26
[3:36:42] xrazzaks: good game plan
[3:36:45] r_kramerz: i think i might hit level 26 2 or 3 days after phase 2 release.
[3:36:45] vk_jp: are you sure those boxes youre saving will grant exp? i thought only higher tiers would
[3:36:52] xrazzaks: im planning on grinding the fuck outta stocks LUL
[3:36:57] thebedshow: not gonna start with a bfd run?
[3:37:03] electric_f33l: the cloth your turning is Wool Cloth only or Silk also @StaysafeTV
[3:37:13] JustaJhin1: they are getting rid of WSG marks no
[3:37:21] itsae__: thought the boxes didnt give worthwhile xp
[3:37:34] numblezzz: is there any reason you are racing to 40? just a personal goal to rush? @StaysafeTV
[3:37:46] mangotrance: how much exp give 3x wsg marks
[3:37:51] biki2112: @JustaJhin1 yes but on feb 6\
[3:37:57] sgtrainbow1: does BFD stay a Raid or change to dungeon?
[3:38:11] numblezzz: gotcha
[3:38:21] Sheldorisafk: Very well planned!
[3:38:28] holdenwook: elite gameplay
[3:38:33] xrazzaks: gonna be a dopppe stream, cant wait!
[3:38:34] windatar: BFD is staying a raid
[3:38:35] holdenwook: full power, 24 hour, no toilet, no shower
[3:38:45] Juubbz: Imagine if BFD just lvls you up once fully :O
[3:38:47] scoobusdoobus: when you were in Slave Pens when TBC dropped man that was hype. you finding the weird bug with the corpse exp boost in the party. classic staysafe
[3:38:51] Furydeath9: Do you have the weekly turn in for Ashenvale counted too
[3:39:09] Valencia_Pete: my question is with all the streamers doing this, will the people on my server start doing it? should i make a bunch of grey woolen shirts and put them on AH or is it only streamer servers that are actually doing this?
[3:39:14] Ritoko: solo RFK or what we talkin
[3:39:49] scoobusdoobus: that was legit af
[3:39:51] Plokoon100: what was it?
[3:40:06] impervious15: props to you. p1 has been stale and here you are still doing it.
[3:40:11] Valencia_Pete: @STREAMSNIPELUL they fill the boxes that are currently being farmed..
[3:40:23] scoobusdoobus: and Blizz okayed it too
[3:40:39] Sheldorisafk: Is the time investment worth the xp?
[3:40:51] boostedeg93: me either
[3:41:04] elrafaelo: Also rep, no?
[3:41:24] LoneStar_LXXV: @StaysafeTV Right? Folks that complain of nothing to do....
[3:41:25] Jekks_: how much level is it from 25-26
[3:41:54] Jekks_: exp is it* not level
[3:41:56] moffz0r: fair enough
[3:42:02] feistygoat37: feistygoat37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:42:04] kasualkaliber: initially its really fun then after hour 6 its grueling
[3:42:09] kingdulli: @staysafetv do you think china will make a move on Thailand before the election because of bidens weak foreign policy
[3:42:09] Jekks_: copyy thankyou
[3:42:10] jaeger4kd: How many times can u do donation of wool?
[3:42:13] jaeger4kd: and doantion of silk?
[3:42:15] heyitsdom_: we aso dont know how much exp you get from the raid
[3:42:17] heyitsdom_: so
[3:42:18] sargent_baddy: around 20 hours in it starts to hit that youre 10 hours away from goal
[3:42:29] Furydeath9: looks like they nerf mage healing again
[3:42:36] boxhead66: saving all those quests for gold
[3:42:43] elrafaelo: @kingdulli thailand? not taiwan?
[3:42:57] originmorii: whats the dungeon route
[3:43:17] OrganikCum: if immolation aura is easy to get and found in the first few hours it will be really fast for you
[3:43:18] jaeger4kd: rfk into sm
[3:43:18] numblezzz: is "weak foreign policy" implying that america is supposed to protect a 1000 year old chinese territory? monkaHmm
[3:43:20] Plokoon100: I prolly missed it. but what are the runes you lock forward to on your lock
[3:43:21] Valencia_Pete: its on yesterday's vod LUL

[3:43:57] Snaketrap: KEKL HORDE
[3:44:10] OrganikCum: quest turnin in ashenvale is the only time
[3:44:15] Natureswisp: Smart
[3:44:19] sk3pnad: GL turning in quest in 1K Needles :)
[3:44:22] cloudstrife543: thats good xp?
[3:44:39] elrafaelo: no? cuz horde get a TP from Booty bay into Gnome
[3:45:16] windatar: Hopefully they do the same thing for alliance for SM
[3:45:17] elrafaelo: I see
[3:45:19] asap_andy_nzl: I’m not in the loop… what are you farming the boxes for?
[3:45:36] Karlton93: air drop from blimp
[3:45:42] Raewhen: Like how the horde camp the entrance of BFD? lol
[3:45:46] maximo469: hmm.. alliance should also get a safe SM entry
[3:45:56] PewPewLOL: do all  the chests give the same exp ?
[3:46:09] windatar: They def are.
[3:46:12] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[3:46:24] hvaqice2200: are you not gonna do bfd when phase 2 comes out?. the xp might be good
[3:46:25] numblezzz: based alliance will cut their way through the masses of greenskins
[3:46:32] windatar: It helps against inflation
[3:46:34] smander: I heard the cave near sludge fen is good box farming
[3:46:37] heylowdub: tigers eye emerald cave is way better for boxes
[3:46:39] windatar: By creating a consumable gold sink
[3:46:54] Valencia_Pete: yeah its lame
[3:46:54] Tinman_VF: WHY DONT COMPLETED BOXES STACK
[3:46:56] Snaketrap: YEP
[3:47:07] Mawshaw: @Tinman_VF They aren't the same item
[3:47:13] puntingyograndma: Ye the 1 box shit is dumb af
[3:47:16] Tinman_VF: they should be
[3:47:19] OrganikCum: the 1 carry limit is why even my main hasnt done it yet, not doing it unless i NEED a rune from it
[3:47:21] Tinman_VF: each tier should be 1 item
[3:47:23] Angeroth: @Tinman_VF blizzard doesn't like logic 4Head
[3:47:26] windatar: It should be at least unique 3-5
[3:47:27] numblezzz: sod has been pretty on point, but the unique boxes has me scratching my head. do devs really think its good design? or just lazy
[3:47:29] boxhead66: ya i never picked them up
[3:47:29] Natureswisp: True
[3:47:31] mangotrance: duo dungeon with 2 accounts one healer one dps worth or not?
[3:47:38] Ruinx81: Runes gonna be locked behind Revered
[3:47:39] sighwarlock: how do you feel about summoning closet coming
[3:47:43] Karlton93: add more vendor to towns in each zone for turn ins maybe
[3:47:45] Snaketrap: YEP retail design. doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff
[3:47:52] stailord: they said it will change in p2
[3:47:59] werebearsuh: can you put your alt on follow for when you get a second and grab two so the trips worth at least 2?
[3:48:12] windatar: Can't wait for mage table they should put in mage table.
[3:48:13] thebedshow: They should just let them be unlimited but only give rep/xp if you actually complete the box and not for turning in an empty box. That solves every issue with them.
[3:48:26] Ruinx81: Classic Andy’s can’t be happy with this box system how it is atm tho
[3:48:38] reavethederp: i think so too
[3:48:44] reavethederp: but in 10 years there could be
[3:48:47] iBanEvader: YEP
[3:48:51] numblezzz: eh, i think its both
[3:48:51] MrPink604: I want it to just keep going
[3:48:55] stankypanky22: II remember you saying sod would be bad
[3:48:59] totezmcgoatz_: but its a season, so it dies eventually
[3:49:01] numblezzz: they are laying the foundation but its also a testing phase
[3:49:08] sighwarlock: @STREAMSNIPELUL SoM BWL was good
[3:49:10] TumadreMG: I HOPE SO
[3:49:14] TumadreMG: but give us achievement if thats true
[3:49:16] CatformTV: but its advertised as season
[3:49:18] windatar: SoD is the beta test for "Seasons" I think they'll keep everything they made in Season of Discovery and that the next season they make will use Season of Discovery as the baseline to create new content on. @StaysafeTV
[3:49:19] reavethederp: huh
[3:49:28] iBanEvader: the runes are phenomenal
[3:49:32] Snaketrap: YEP until the "Fresh" crowd cries
[3:49:32] HoochieBaba: but they called it a seasonal server
[3:49:37] cloudstrife543: still doing era raids from 2019 starting
[3:49:43] NaManDatAintMe: so is there an herb enchant that stacks with the herb gloves for tauren to pick goldthorn?
[3:49:48] iBanEvader: bfd raid was solid
[3:49:51] iBanEvader: ashenvale sucked
[3:50:06] CatformTV: Season of GDKPs is the next season
[3:50:12] sighwarlock: Chromag fight was rlly fun in som
[3:50:14] Ruinx81: Maybe we won’t even be doing MC etc
[3:50:21] cloudstrife543: cant wait for the dad raiders to do upgraded chromaggus KEKW
[3:50:24] numblezzz: @NaManDatAintMe tauren have a racial to boost herbalism
[3:50:27] stailord: hope they get rid of 40man raid tbh
[3:50:28] sargent_baddy: still dont think itll be enough
[3:50:32] heylowdub: they should add raid finder and wow token
[3:50:32] thisisgoodcontent: theyre gonna have to make MC way way harder
[3:50:32] evazer0x: kill wbs in raid EZ
[3:50:36] h2h_nillz: What happened to season of mastery i was off the grid during that
[3:50:37] windatar: Regular MC and Season of master MC can be heroic MC
[3:50:39] HoochieBaba: SM raid at 50 confirmed?
[3:50:44] xxLucas: Lvl 25 mages solo content better than most 60 classes lol
[3:50:47] Ruinx81: MC as 10 man
[3:50:51] baade123: @h2h_nillz youre looking at it
[3:50:55] CatformTV: what about sunken temple
[3:51:00] windatar: LOL
[3:51:03] Morgrainne_Nost: KEKW
[3:51:04] reavethederp: yessss
[3:51:04] h2h_nillz: oooo
[3:51:05] reefo: it'll be sunken temple, SM makes no sense at 50
[3:51:08] reavethederp: 10 man mc pog
[3:51:09] skoop7: 25
[3:51:12] Morgrainne_Nost: 80 man raids
[3:51:12] lonzo_22: they should molten core bwl etc 25m raids since we will be doing so much damage
[3:51:13] toeshred: We need a savannah themed raid at 60, with elite giraffe, and even a giraffe boss.
[3:51:15] bboofit: 25 man with worse loot
[3:51:16] xxLucas: With power scaling, youll be ableto clear with 10
[3:51:17] reavethederp: no more 40 mans
[3:51:18] climbingviking: changing MC is a waste of dev time
[3:51:23] CatformTV: why not flex raiding?
[3:51:23] reavethederp: 40 man is bad
[3:51:23] trebolz: they should all be 40 man
[3:51:26] thaplayboy69: only people who never had to organize a 40 man say 40 mans are the best lmao
[3:51:29] ProfessionalBirdLawyer: 100 Pog
[3:51:29] bennihanah: @toeshred bruh
[3:51:31] windatar: @reefo They've already teased it SM at 50 is already set in stone. with Kara at 60.
[3:51:35] loginlava: they should add a boss with huge tits
[3:51:36] 冂凵乃口: 120 BRD raid Pog
[3:51:42] stailord: nah 40man are painfull
[3:51:55] iBanEvader: @CatformTV that would be nice but then they have to hp balance the bosses
[3:51:57] thaplayboy69: almost anyone ive spoken to who ran a guild in classic says 40 mans were a horrific thing to manage, coming from someone who had to aswelll. its true
[3:52:03] m4honen: heard that size doesnt matter
[3:52:07] windatar: I could see SM at 50 being a 20 man BWL style.
[3:52:07] chinchopaaaaaaaa: let us raid with other faction
[3:52:11] numblezzz: they will add a 20 man furbolg raid and 40 man scarlet raid
[3:52:13] revolt4200: saying based is crindge
[3:52:21] Snaketrap: monkaHmm
