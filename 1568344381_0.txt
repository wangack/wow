[0:58:09] LearnedSomething: sure
[0:58:10] ThePawPaw: plus our tier peaces
[0:58:10] kay0234: @zenFX_ idk what world you live in but most kids don't move out at 18.
[0:58:23] mrelgaato: @ThePawPaw usually till 61 lvl
[0:58:28] Sollice: @ThePawPaw Like Shadowlands one? No they are turned off

[1:00:22] TacDuc: @shytam I moved out last week, and I'm 19, but that's just because I went to university, otherwise I would have done earlier if I was done with my prerequisites earlier
[1:00:24] Noshpan: smh
[1:00:30] strike879: i love the new auction house no need to wait anymore just dump it on and its sold
[1:00:40] WhiteKnight74648: I was able to buy my first condo and put a down payment on it 12-13 years ago. cant say I could do that now. lol
[1:00:40] suhfur: Ret pali good for pvp?
[1:00:43] LearnedSomething: TacDuc again, the exception, not the rule
[1:00:50] Ispintowin: im 22 and i moved out last year because i found a place i liked and top of that there was nowhere to rent where i wanted to live
[1:01:01] QuigsTV: @towelliee I haven’t been in the stream in a min. How’s it going. How’s prot pala feeling atm?

[1:02:10] Shubwub: me? :)
[1:02:27] Noshpan: The town I used to live in, the landlords liked to rip off Navy families who couldn't afford to live on base. So rent there is as much as it is in San Fransisco.

[1:29:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rescue tuskarrs!
[1:29:31] Squirrel_nutty: hes a pro at healing woonds
[1:29:32] Gunman1g: he heal a lot of woons, champion
[1:29:38] pyrphorosgr: we sure do know about WOONSS
[1:30:04] Orion280: you have to get blue speed then look up while pressing 2 is how i understand it
[1:30:13] newkingcody: heal da woons
[1:30:41] jordanshy: whats going on
[1:30:44] Woodland_Critter: What's your ilevel now at 68 @Towelliee ?

[1:32:21] Orion280: @towelliee how i understand the momentum upwards works is you get blue speed and look up while you also press 2 at the same time i could be wrong though but that's how i understood it from watching yumy do it
[1:32:27] nayden69: If i haven't bought SL expansion but i preorder dragonflight can i immidietly jump and play? @Towelliee
[1:32:35] Woodland_Critter: Yea, I don't think that will be final. Weird to be 70 and not replace a single piece for a lot of characters.
[1:32:38] smashwow: thinking 14hrs for first time levelers?
[1:32:54] jmalmin: That sounds like a bug. world quests should give EXP.
[1:33:28] Orion280: it doesn't slow you down immediately
[1:33:37] LearnedSomething: fun not intended
[1:34:14] jetributions: he wonders
[1:34:16] mentulgg: hey there hows it going
[1:34:23] smashwow: target acquired. nerf the fun.
[1:34:37] Shiekrunner: @smashwow it took me 8hours on alpha and the scaling was bugged
[1:34:48] TheItalianStallion321: its probably going to take me like 24 hours just b/c of work and play time
[1:34:56] smashwow: that's fair.
[1:35:12] Woodland_Critter: 300 ilevel with a strong solo DPS spec will shave off some hours.
[1:35:23] strike879: gear , rested spec/class , solo/group all makes a diffrence
[1:35:38] PvtHudson093: roughly about 65 i think
[1:35:48] xanarel22: will there be valor and creation catalyst equivalent in DF?
[1:35:54] Scoodles91: probebly 65 last past expacs
[1:35:57] Galadeon: what about lego powers that turned into talents?
[1:36:01] zgag: Wasn't corruption gear disabled during the pre-patch
[1:36:11] smashwow: which is typically how they did it except in SL where the gear was DOA except for the massive primary stat
[1:36:12] jmalmin: I have a feeling legos will be disabled in prepatch because some legos has turned into talents. Double dipping probably wont be a thing.
[1:36:20] Woodland_Critter: what gear level does heroics currently drop in DF @Towelliee ?
[1:36:30] Brodih_: will pre-patch include the new talents?
[1:36:31] smashwow: 291-ish
[1:36:35] Brodih_: wrath*
[1:36:36] zgag: @jmalmin Good point
[1:36:42] strike879: so if ppl get a 304 for a leggo spot save it so you can equip once the power stops working
[1:36:52] Haxintar: @Qazh_ Yes, and it always does :)
[1:36:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Dragonflight's New Faction Renown System is a GAME CHANGER!! youtu.be/Bp5hXzpLb-w
[1:36:55] Woodland_Critter: @Qazh_ I believe so, yes.
[1:37:09] PvtHudson093: might be worth covering yourself and having back up 304 pieces for your legendary slots
[1:37:20] Brodih_: good thanks @Haxintar @Woodland_Critter
[1:37:24] Gunman1g: you will start DF talents in prepatch? @jmalmin
[1:37:37] xanarel22: @towelliee will there be valor and creation catalyst equivalent in DF?
[1:37:37] smashwow: yeah basically don't throw away gear
[1:38:08] strike879: max leggo is 291 so the backup will be 13 ilvl upgrade
[1:38:09] smashwow: but scaling is probably different based on lvling and some of that cata green action will happen
[1:38:13] luckfore: are we expecting a build tuesday?
[1:38:15] codefiveone: the stats will  still be on the lego gear
[1:38:22] deedeemegadoodooo: loving the zone design in DF
[1:38:55] PvtHudson093: yeah but the leggos are stuck at 291 when you could have 304 pieces in that slot
[1:39:05] Snabido: Gotta give hints at future allied race Kappa
[1:39:16] luckfore: the campaigns in all zones could have been a bit longer
[1:39:29] jmalmin: I would save gear that is 304 and has the lego spot. Didnt we lose the powers of the amulet and BFA gear in the prepatch to Shadowlands?
[1:39:30] zgag: If the Nov 28th leak is correct Beta needs to be very very soon
[1:39:43] illanxiety: yea 2 weeks
[1:39:46] Orion280: will they keep doing builds every week? or they chilling next week?
[1:39:53] maxkule: I hope they just open beta to everyone. Get as much feedback as possible.
[1:39:53] lynxess92: out of 10 what do u rate it so far
[1:40:00] Retpally9329: always do sidequests gotta keep that loremaster up
[1:40:10] Shrenko: you arent supposed to get momentum going up though, right?
[1:40:11] ergolucky: mat3br0n7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:40:25] humanzd: Hopefully DH talents this week
[1:40:38] Orion280: it's button number 2 you have to press not 1
[1:40:45] Funderik: alot of the stuff we getting on release is already on alpha, other then the raid, don't think they need a large beta period, the remaining time will be spent on the talents.
[1:41:40] Seras_Irmadoun: I think you need to get the momentum before going up.
[1:42:24] maxkule: I hope pre-patch introduces the new xp leveling squish. I have 50's that I would love to get to 60 but dread doing SL stuff.
[1:42:25] bharjes1: good morning everyone
[1:43:29] codefiveone: is regular flying allowed in DL?
[1:43:42] luckfore: xp needed from 50-60 is the same @maxkule
[1:44:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mega leaker
[1:44:08] maxkule: @luckfore No its not. It was massively nerfed.
[1:44:09] jarilrpg: @maxkule prepatch always adds system changes, so the new xp scale would be in then
[1:44:11] Shrenko: inside spy monkaS
[1:44:17] lithium364: im totally fine with pre patch starting sooner UI rework and talent rework are big deals for casual players aswell
[1:44:20] felinesanonymous: heard something like that Dragonflight was 40 years after the Dark Portal Opening
[1:44:22] jarilrpg: @codefiveone not at the moment
[1:44:38] Aervyper: @Towelliee need ghostcrawler to leak LOL MMO \
[1:44:46] MarquisLek: the leaker is ybarra
[1:44:52] puddypounce: saved

[1:45:14] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @maxkule (warning)
[1:45:20] humanzd: If they leave covenants/legendaries/sets working during the prepatch, we are going to be insanely broken for a few weeks
[1:45:31] luckfore: @maxkule it was nerfed and then reverted, those are old numbers
[1:45:31] NestLucky: for playing the pre-patch i need dragonfilght expansion pre-purchase? sorry for the ignorance
[1:45:40] strike879: anyone know if the dragonriding tallent tree is locked behind anything if not it might even be a good idea to just get the glyphs before really leveling
[1:46:02] Gunman1g: @NestLucky no need. that is like a trailer for you to push to buy
[1:46:09] remixonfire91: @NestLucky no
[1:46:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: 8 weeks!
[1:46:27] NestLucky: ok thanks guys
[1:46:30] lithium364: Also: First dragonflight short cinematic this week possibly
[1:46:39] winraider: So according to this in 4 months will have release?

[1:46:50] Snabido: Towelstradamus in action, you heard it here guys 😏
[1:47:00] anygrinders: the internal build always is ahead, art stuff is easy to change
[1:47:16] agnarz: blizz knows itll be a banger
[1:47:48] Orion280: do you know if there will still be weekly builds?
[1:47:49] swervity82: is there an alt slot i can run bulwark on.. the leggo ring is so damn expensive
[1:47:52] jmalmin: The talents looks to be changing every other day for some classes... Except for mages... Blizzard dosnt like Mages anymore says some on the forums...
[1:48:21] augiecrockett: I wish they would hurry up and announce that shit so I can get my vacation time put in lol
[1:48:31] Xanaxtasy: They should push PTR as fast as possible for more talent testing
[1:48:41] humanzd: rogue talents looking pretty good, they just need some minor tweaks
[1:48:43] anygrinders: @augiecrockett, i hope they take their time and dont rush anything
[1:48:57] Kratosjr1: Kratosjr1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 69 months! Oops I did it again
[1:49:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's a bug
[1:49:02] RandomXY: Is only prepatch chill. They will fix it on launch.
[1:49:02] lithium364: @Towelliee if you have another dev interview, can you ask how big the back of the hunter dev is ? hes carrying all feedback kekw
[1:49:14] mrelgaato: @humanzd my thoughts exactly)
[1:49:20] luckfore: @Kratosjr1 nice Kappa

[1:49:45] weekend_warrior_dave: with druid dev leaving even cant see how they will make the deadline possible
[1:49:49] tamwyn217: "ripcord"
[1:49:55] TheItalianStallion321: bro, its only 10.1 relax, they will fix things in 10.2

[1:51:57] LearnedSomething: we'll see
[1:51:58] humanzd: I'm just hoping for an expansion where you can just log in and play the game, nothing mandatory to do every day for 10-20 mins...
[1:52:03] moxing_hei: rip feral
[1:52:04] weekend_warrior_dave: server issues :P
[1:52:08] SpoofAvatar: DF needs a system
[1:52:09] zgag: The huge problem is that the problems you mentioned the issues were brought up during testing. Blizzard just didn't listen to the feedback
[1:52:10] Noshpan: In Legion, I didn't get my legendary until near the end of the expansion, & it wasn't even a good legendary.
[1:52:12] anygrinders: no system within a system RN, but wait till the last week of beta, and they will implement some stupid stuff just like they did in bfa beta with th azerit system and releasing it without testing LUL
[1:52:17] PvtHudson093: just dont release the game at the wrong time

[1:52:51] TLew02: @Towelliee I didn't get a chance to watch you play BrM, how did it feel on the Alpha?
[1:52:59] luckfore: ion said it would be
[1:53:04] luckfore: did he LIE ?? :O
[1:53:07] lithium364: does the new renown give you meaningful gear or just cosmetics?
[1:53:12] HairyAreolaus: Guaranteed there’s a system already on the back burner.
[1:53:20] jmalmin: That is blizzard going back on what they said. Blizzard did say it would be account wide.
[1:53:34] humanzd: Is there player power tied to the renown rewards?
[1:53:36] procyon_mfc: They will likely increase it from 30 each per renown
[1:53:39] jarilrpg: @Towelliee you think they will cap renown in those factions per week?
[1:53:54] Boosti661: If they make it account wide they’ll have to lock the rep earned per day.
[1:53:58] PvtHudson093: i just hope blizz are not being to ambitious about releasing it nefore the end of 22
[1:54:03] DevilSpire: the fact that rep isn't account wide now is annoying
[1:54:30] Noshpan: I suspect it won't be account bound at launch, but will be eventually. But I'm just basing this on past experience
[1:54:34] anygrinders: all i hope for is no renown cap or anything, just let the people grind for it if they want to and have the time, stop putting a weekly cap on everything
[1:54:38] luckfore: will be account wide on launch towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium

[1:56:24] zenkodac: i cant handle that much at max 2 or 3 at the start the rest of my alts i normaly do half way thru the first tier
[1:56:30] jarilrpg: @Towelliee you think they will cap renown in those factions per week?
[1:56:32] sabernn: with no systems to grind, do you think once people get to max level, they will be bored until season starts, with all there is to do for pre season gear, from an outside looking in perspective
[1:56:32] Omegacloud: the first thing i usually do is log on every char and farm rested exp
[1:56:37] luckfore: oh cool
[1:56:40] lithium364: do wrathion and sabellian have different rewards?
[1:56:41] Snabido: Sounds good, make sense

[1:56:57] weedyy22: i level all healers to max but its more of i have to do it... first time is ok rest is work
[1:56:58] procyon_mfc: So maybe they'll allow your main to buy tokens for your alts like 10 renown per token for 10,000 gold

[1:59:22] procyon_mfc: monkaS floating sharks
[1:59:35] lithium364: lmao
[1:59:52] Blazedx: corruption Pog
[2:00:01] Gravelode: 100% toweeliiee right
[2:00:02] abracka_: maybe they'll drop earthwarden tanks for evoker in 10.2.5 towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:00:03] dracullus: 10.1: Return of AP
[2:00:09] luckfore: 10.1 AP
[2:00:10] SpoofAvatar: gimmie a system
[2:00:15] Todmeister9000: I loved the Heart of azeroth
[2:00:18] strike879: i think the only way to make account wide renown work in dragonflight is only put rep on the calling or however its called and then put a flag so any alts that also do the calling dont get the rep part of the reward
[2:00:20] SunnyAutumns: Essences? Netherlight Crucible? Shards of Domination?
[2:00:39] kodder12: I shark?
[2:00:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the raid buffs will be a big catchup
[2:00:46] kodder12: ? shark above water?
[2:00:54] luckfore: ppl are alot more skeptical now so i wouldnt be surprised if it started off slower than SL
[2:01:02] captiv8: Maybe making a tier set or a piece of gear give you an extra talent point or two?  That could be a legendary item or something.
[2:01:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know why the shark is not in the water LUL
[2:01:12] zgag: Powers can be fine.  They could also mimic the corrupted gear with introducing it at end of the xpac.  ( having 2-3 borrowed powers at the start of xpac is a bad idea)
[2:01:23] zgag: the *
[2:01:24] Snabido: @wEiRdO_dUdE Welcome to WoW physics
[2:01:35] anygrinders: i thinka good middle ground would be to not make the factions acc wide on launch, BUT give twinks som head start so they dont have to start from scratch
[2:01:40] HairyAreolaus: Guaranteed they already have a system on the back burner.
[2:01:50] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[2:01:52] anygrinders: @HairyAreolaus, yep
[2:02:34] procyon_mfc: What do you think Blizz can do to refresh WQs
[2:02:40] procyon_mfc: or what has DF done
[2:02:48] Aidler: that’s not a good solution
[2:02:52] procyon_mfc: I guess to entice more ppl to do them
[2:03:05] procyon_mfc: k
[2:03:07] futomara01: good f the long WQS
[2:03:15] Todmeister9000: are there callings?
[2:03:26] agnarz: BFA wq werent bad at all
[2:03:29] dracullus: and how emissaries look like? we still have more variety like with SL?
[2:03:32] TacDuc: Another Turtle has made it to the water
[2:03:35] Snabido: Are warden quests back? :eyes.
[2:03:37] procyon_mfc: find a happy medium
[2:03:47] Funderik: innovation could lead to just over deving, making them long, annoying and unfun. best to just keep WQs simple and optional
[2:03:52] Gooseberries: They were simple in SL too just too many steps so it was like 4WQ in 1
[2:04:29] humanzd: Are world quests like in shadowlands? Legion/Bfa had so much better world quests
[2:04:44] procyon_mfc: I guess thats the main thing: variety
[2:04:52] anygrinders: @Funderik, exactly, since they are all the time up (not like daylies for example) they should be easy repeatable, simple and quick
[2:05:06] strike879: long WQ are not bad but they do need a good time / reward its bad if a 5 min quest gives the same as a 30 min quest
[2:05:16] Jiraiya110: what are the rewards for WQ ?
[2:05:24] smashiii123: they can always make epic WQ like the world bosses which are more complex, but the basic WQ should just be easy and dumb @Towelliee
[2:05:53] captiv8: Do you think they will ever add a new profession to the game in a future expansion?
[2:05:53] xluckydawgx: Renown
[2:05:56] Funderik: i'm not sure what people expect from quests and world quests honestly, i have no idea how they can get improved. every mmo has the problem. it's how the genre is.
[2:05:57] Zeppyy: just events
[2:05:58] Venasmat: Events
[2:05:59] Belveen: @Towelliee are you going witha marathon on release?
[2:06:02] Mr_Dusty: 'Rifts' well, from, Rift
[2:06:27] Keyastaron_: waht up @Towelliee  hows the alpha?
[2:06:32] Zeppyy: but GW2, in those "Events" you can get end game gear
[2:06:37] QuesoFM: fates in ff14
[2:06:41] Arkangel_I: in an event everyone contribute but in wow it is personal
[2:06:42] Venasmat: GW2 just has tons more because it's a main feature :D
[2:06:50] zgag: Rift has some pretty cool events when it was first released
[2:06:52] DiiscoViking: yup
[2:06:58] mrelgaato: Will he have some bigger rewards for completing lets say 4 quests for 1 faction like in Legion or BFA? @Towelliee
[2:06:58] Moobot: Read all about the new Auction House changes at https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23833174/shadowlands-927-update-notes
[2:06:59] MOLAR305: i wish legion invasions came back in some form, i had fun doing those
[2:07:01] Promilie: Difference is the events in GW2 are chained together to form narratives and coalesce into "meta events"
[2:07:17] Blah206: @MOLAR305 Agreed
[2:07:24] procyon_mfc: Toejam LUL
[2:07:24] humanzd: We had those portals in Legion 7.3
[2:07:34] procyon_mfc: BibleThump
[2:07:34] PvtHudson093: where's Earl?

[2:09:05] procyon_mfc: pls
[2:09:24] smashiii123: my mother died, better kill someone innocent
[2:09:34] TheCliffyShow: Apparently, Toejam got big and hairy since the last game. And, lost his third leg.
[2:09:36] mozavich: @procyon_mfc yes please!
[2:10:25] PadidinJones: Hey @Towelliee hows the lvling exp going?

[2:11:09] NuriCraft: Hoggers son?
[2:11:09] TheCliffyShow: I want a baby tuskarr as a pet. Like Tottle, the baby tortollian.
[2:11:13] PvtHudson093: Baby Gnoll could have been the new charity pet
[2:11:16] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee It looks like Tuskar did something with a Vulpera LOL
[2:11:59] DiiscoViking: the other guy
[2:12:23] Mitune: They really should add a fishing boss that you beat with fishing sorta like Tempoross in OSRS
[2:12:52] captiv8: I would like to see them expand on ideas like the artifact fishing pole. Maybe do a legendary pick axe unlocking or something.
[2:12:58] procyon_mfc: fwends
[2:13:12] felinesanonymous: uwu fwends
[2:13:19] humanzd: @Towelliee Are you tied to a certain faction like covenants, or can you do all of them at the same time?
[2:13:20] TheCliffyShow: So many baby versions of races that could be good battle pets.
[2:14:00] Rottencoarse: u skipped a quest there btw @Towelliee
[2:14:08] Rottencoarse: was that the elite quest?
[2:14:17] Keyastaron_: just zone specific ?
[2:14:20] wisplingz: will there any time gap between alpha and beta next week ?
[2:14:29] PadidinJones: #NORIPCORD
[2:14:34] Mitune: They didnt install the rip cord this time, so hope the first chute works Kappa
[2:14:39] luckfore: no emissaries/calling?

[2:16:15] OJWestTV: what you enjoying the most?
[2:16:18] TheGiant99: Good Morning Hammer Squad
[2:16:40] Reavios: gray on the map usually means underground?
[2:16:43] TheCliffyShow: I liked mission tables.
[2:16:47] TheGiant99: Because Stone Cold Said so
[2:16:52] strike879: so sad no table made milions in WoD
[2:16:59] epockite: are they going to make the buffs/debuffs moveable?
[2:17:06] Noshpan: @Towelliee So what flavor do you plan for Boomer Blast to be?
[2:17:11] Chrizedits: Why would people play the beta this much ?
[2:17:11] TheGiant99: You almsot every version I think of stone cold
[2:17:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomer Blast needs mango in it
[2:17:46] WolfofWarSong: my starter kit shipped should be here friday im super excited
[2:17:49] Shubwub: Do I have to drink watermelon to raid mythic?
[2:18:03] WolfofWarSong: tang is very boomer
[2:18:04] Blah206: yes
[2:18:06] justagamingfiend: Boomer blast is going to be either New Coke or Tabb from the 80's
[2:18:10] Mitune: Old country pink lemonade is true boomer
[2:18:21] Noshpan: I think something similar to Tang or orange cicle would be nice. Nostalgic for Tang & Orange Julius
[2:18:26] PvtHudson093: was going to say that it needs to be a flavour from the past
[2:19:56] Blah206: haha

[2:20:13] Frank4LuLz: orange julius @Towelliee
[2:20:14] abracka_: certified boomer status
[2:20:15] smashwow: it was the space age drink
[2:20:15] codefiveone: tang was developed by NASA
[2:20:18] PvtHudson093: its what the astronauts drank
[2:20:29] Featherbow: the soundtrack makes this a very serious conversation lol
[2:20:31] Mibd2010: drink for astronauts
[2:21:04] Kriven: Towelliee you ready for the NASA launch later this month?
[2:21:23] Kriven: Launching the moon rocket baby
[2:21:23] Athaeln: Did you see that Lirik is a dad now?Time sure flies , I remember your arenas back in the day
[2:21:43] procyon_mfc: "healthier"
[2:21:45] ArcaneMaki: Sales of Tang were poor until NASA used it on John Glenn's Mercury flight in February 1962,[5] and on subsequent Gemini missions.[6] Since then it has been closely associated with the U.S. human spaceflight program, which created the misconception that Tang was invented for the space program.
[2:21:45] MarquisLek: 2 months to pre-patch
[2:21:49] procyon_mfc: basically pure sugar lol
[2:21:50] TheCliffyShow: NASA is actually doing a launch? I guess they got tired of the billionaires taking all the attention.

[2:23:50] Shubwub: 25 lol in the UK though
[2:23:54] ArcaneMaki: Yeah K&D powder packet is actually Tang powder!
[2:23:57] PvtHudson093: I know of Tang but nver tried it because its an american thing
[2:24:01] Kriven: The SLS rocket is targeted to launch during a two-hour window that opens at 8:33 a.m. EDT Monday, Aug. 29, from Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy.
[2:24:02] Mitune: I have known about tang since I was kid in the 90s but never had it to my knowledge
[2:24:03] 91Niki: TANG aren't an EU thing Towelliee :p
[2:24:04] procyon_mfc: Artemis I planning to launch Aug 29, it will be unmanned 6-week moon orbiting mission to test systems.  Artemis II (manned) will launch sometime next year.

[2:29:09] Urebaldd: Does it mix better than gfuel? The only thing I didn't like about gfuel was the chalkyness
[2:29:18] LaConoPerro: !timer
[2:29:20] abracka_: lmao
[2:29:59] xThebubbler: @Urebaldd Yep. There isn't really a chalkyness to them compared to gfuel.

[2:32:40] 91Niki: I personally like the Gfuel effect, cuz it isn't like energy drink like energy. Regular energy drinks will keep me up for more than 24 hours. Like I legit run on walls. Gfuel just gives me a small boost. I wanna try Advanced at some point. I hope it isn't too much of an energy boost
[2:33:05] TheGiant99: @Towelliee you think beta will be soon
[2:33:21] LethalSquirrel: Nah i get that, but Gfuel was an energy blend that just never seemed to do much for me. Liked the flavors tho. I got good energy from Amino energy and was expecting Gfuel to be like that

[3:02:09] Clicklesly: Sounds like the drake part comes later?
[3:02:10] Akuka_: I would assume you collect like this and then mount in the other area to drop

[3:03:51] WhaleTusks: do you lose all momentum when you dismount midair? that feels kinda jank compared to normal mounts
[3:03:55] Shiekrunner: like those 5 people LuL
[3:03:56] MrGharr: feedback: I can see 5 fish under your net, but quest still counts it as 1
[3:03:58] LegoCoin: Cool they are doing some more RL like activities

[3:05:37] Artiiz: You can often buy most things off of AH
[3:05:46] Artiiz: Some are quite expensive though
[3:05:49] LegoCoin: It was lots of Sunday's turnaments were only on day you had to catch the fish and beat other players to turning.
[3:05:53] MrGharr: but the artifact gives water walking, and some other perks
[3:05:56] LegoCoin: @mrelgaato forgot to @ you
[3:06:07] procyon_mfc: The legion one's powers are disabled so I use Arcanite pole I won off the STV fishing contest.
[3:06:21] procyon_mfc: I have boots of Booty Bay too that'll port me to Booty Bay
[3:06:25] mrelgaato: Ty @LegoCoin

[3:07:22] ottavianni: thats my fishing experince :P

[3:09:23] Artiiz: is it hard to win?
[3:09:56] procyon_mfc: depends on how many are competing.  I'd recommend setting your hearth to booty bay tavern for quick port back once you collect all the req fish
[3:10:17] procyon_mfc: There are 1-3rd prizes
[3:10:26] LegoCoin: Are we unpausing now?

[3:45:22] PidiaP: Demon hunter mains would be very angry if they could read towCry
[3:45:31] Nokterian: with 5 buttons it becomes to much thinking for DH Kappa
[3:45:55] Razmasbear: protodrake customisation is the REAL reward ^^

[3:47:34] notColt45: LUL
[3:47:34] Sollice: They are making movement skills generate more fury and uptime on buff, so you will see momentmum on steroid builds in DF. DHs will have ants in their pants
[3:47:40] Nokterian: VDH gonna have 2 extra buttons Kappa

[4:15:36] Reckless_Monk: fr
[4:15:38] buffaatrox: only thing that would make me drop elvui is performance, raiding on lowest settings on a good pc and sometimes goign 30fps
[4:15:41] TrixStar36: @pacific3210 ElvUI is far too advanced for 90% of WOW players lol
[4:15:42] SauceFu: I can't stand ElvUI
[4:15:44] wxlfvoid: blizzard suck at making UI
[4:15:54] Reckless_Monk: ElvUI would just be Sadge

[4:39:49] Exxcar: So geared out characters aren't gonna get anything from leveling?
[4:40:02] Exxcar: Well taking all those dragonriding transmog will be easy then
[4:40:11] eFoKuZ: @Exxcar they usually never do for the first like 5 levels of a new xpac
[4:40:19] Artenuous: new expac SHOULD be like 15 hrs imo
[4:40:19] theDirtyon3: Geared players never use leveling gear
[4:40:32] Exxcar: @eFoKuZ But this is looking like they aren't going to get anything
[4:40:38] Exxcar: except maybe the last 2 hours
[4:40:43] Exxcar: levels*
[4:40:59] eFoKuZ: @Exxcar true i misinterpreted what you were saying my bad
[4:41:04] theDirtyon3: @Exxcar mythic level people dont replace gear til like the last level while they level
[4:41:19] theDirtyon3: this is not uncommon
[4:41:26] dreamwalker213: @dynomite826 they are very different so it depends on what you enjoy
[4:41:37] TheCliffyShow: Transmogs!
[4:41:38] CritcobainTV: This is the standings btw for great push https://raider.io/mythic-dungeon-international/the-great-push-shadowlands-season-4/tournament-teams/amer
[4:41:40] Broomba: leveling in DF to max level is going to be different for people, assuming that towelliee does main quests in X time doesnt mean you will do it better and faster
[4:41:42] Cranxjs: and vor enchan.
[4:41:45] Mattsta: you'll get the leveling transmog :O

[4:42:18] Sarocus: And even in Lich King, people did Naxx in Sunwell gear
[4:42:22] Gunlove: thats what I do
[4:42:31] acehornet2: I like to complete everything once
[4:42:41] Armdel: im guessing exp will be adjusted anyway so you don't need as many side quests
[4:42:48] dreamwalker213: Even people in classic  right now with full sunwell gear isn’t replacing stuff until like late 70s
[4:42:51] Broomba: my answer to those talking about speed leveling and how fast it would take -- just play the game
[4:42:55] Broomba: and enjoy ti
[4:42:57] Broomba: it
[4:42:57] Sarocus: Could be. Dont remember
[4:43:07] propwash80: @towelliee what would you say the average player would have to do to make a decent amount of golf in game? seems like the only way to make any good is either farming items and selling or crafting
[4:43:24] theDirtyon3: @Broomba speed leveling is they way some people enjoy the game though
[4:43:27] NeoVLace: NeoVLace subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 51 months!

[4:44:43] Broomba: @theDirtyon3 no its facts, it happens all the time when a new game or expansion comes out
[4:44:45] theNebuchadnezzar: WHATS THE EMERSERRY?'
[4:45:16] theDirtyon3: @Broomba opinions are not facts my friend. Have a good day.

[4:45:33] rohdey: i've even sold LFR boe's for 75k
[4:45:40] Jarlan23: or shadowlands rather
[4:45:48] Broomba: @theDirtyon3 ok you believe that point of view, but its in every game and expansion, sorry if you fall into that category, just dont whine
[4:46:01] Meatshyld: No shame in it
[4:46:06] Snowiton: it is 330k now for eu
[4:46:14] strike879: skip mcdonalds and buy a token
[4:46:23] Rudric_Ice: 15 bucks and 20 bucks
[4:46:28] tastytictacs: lol ya, you can't make gold in game if you don't have the time... unless ur lucky. nothing wrong with buying gold, i wouldve bought tokens for the brutosaur if i had a stable job then, lol
[4:46:44] Meatshyld: @strike879 fast food is like 2 tokens if you are getting meals for 3-4 people
[4:46:49] TheCliffyShow: @strike879 Both likely to make you fat.
[4:46:52] xRaZoNx: german server its 300k

[4:47:29] Overhaul_1229: farming gold not worth the time imo
[4:47:29] snorpytv: NotLikeThis  action bars still not lined up with exp bar  NotLikeThis
[4:47:30] tastytictacs: token = bis
[4:47:34] School_Toilets: I see world quests in DF but no emissary or calling, maybe I missed it
[4:47:41] Jarlan23: i like farming materials instead its relaxing and i can do it whenever i want
[4:47:43] TheCliffyShow: I was hoping to reach a million gold for the first time before DF.
[4:47:52] Exxcar: @Towelliee how long does it usually take to sell all those tokens?
[4:47:59] abracka_: @SpyCrabbo wow token wasn't introduced until WoD, found the susanexpress buyer
[4:48:18] Funderik: you would :P
[4:48:18] Jarlan23: @TheCliffyShow check the auction house prices are all over the place rn you can make gold off it
[4:48:21] Exxcar: I mean they will be able to with work orders right?
[4:48:24] s2Sammy369: world first players
[4:48:43] Jarlan23: like yesterday shadowlands ore was 6g and now its up to 13g
[4:48:45] SpyCrabbo: @abracka_ really? damn i must have had no gold at all then
[4:48:54] Jarlan23: and stuff sells instantly
[4:49:01] TheCliffyShow: @Jarlan23 Oh, I've been keeping an eye on it.
[4:49:21] Mattsta: @Exxcar for the high level stuff...the person on the receiving end of the work order needs to supply soulbound mats
[4:49:32] Rudric_Ice: my old server died Dalaran PepeHands
[4:50:04] propwash80: @towelliee do you think there will be an open beta for DF?
[4:50:04] Exxcar: @Exxcar And people with multi-max gold cap will buy the mythic run, and then use the workorders
[4:50:43] Jarlan23: thats all i will be doing pretty much
[4:50:51] Jarlan23: not the boosting part my guild does mythic

[5:18:18] XiMoee: but we will be able to save many templates, so we can save interrupt and non interrupt talent trees.
[5:18:21] starknadooo: I hope they change the priest tree... At this moment disc and holy are the only healers with no interrupt.
[5:18:31] sitmeee: True if you dont know what youre doing then yeah
[5:18:33] siickz0hniin3: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:18:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: can't someone else do it Kappa
[5:18:35] flebbooo: now dps gonna argue interupting is a healer job now that more healers have access to it LUL
[5:18:35] gritbarontv: that is why, i keep saying there is going to be cookie cutter builds
[5:19:41] brewgamingtv: oh god lol
[5:19:44] zgag: Towelliee.  If you were to rank the dungeons you have done so far in Dragon Flight what would be your top 3
[5:19:46] brewgamingtv: that will be aid's lol
[5:19:47] SpyCrabbo: m+? people are gonna be ass in regular lfg dungeons
[5:20:00] s2Sammy369: blizzard needs to ban all addons
[5:20:20] sitmeee: LUL ban all addons
[5:20:25] Beli_Mar: they would just look you up on armory...banning addons wont do anything
[5:20:25] y0rtek: @s2Sammy369 thats a terrible take
[5:20:30] dreamwalker213: Anyone trying to join a m+ without an interrupt should be kicked lol
[5:20:33] Snabido: Then dungeons get tuned around that issue by either removing casting abilities from mobs, or make them uninterruptable Keepo
[5:20:41] Rudric_Ice: ban all "combat addons''
[5:20:56] Aidler: more reasons to not do m+…..to keep my sanity
[5:21:02] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @s2sammy369 dont give them any ideas u was probably one of the people bitching about multiboxing too huh

[5:22:21] 91Niki: People already suck at interrupting in this game. So yeah, it def should be baseline
[5:22:24] s2Sammy369: i should have been more specific, ban raid addons, for pussys who dont think and need to be told what to do
[5:22:26] SpyCrabbo: i already know exactly who in my raid won't take interrupts
[5:23:12] sitmeee: If you want to coplete high keys your gonna have to spec interrupt low keys are a free for all I believe.
[5:23:15] dreamwalker213: I like the choice personally, you don’t always need a kick for raiding. Problem is players are monkeys and will not take it when they should
[5:23:16] swampt1l: I can’t wait for a boss that’s gotta be interrupted every time and there’s only 1 person with it like the one In Kara
[5:23:31] sitmeee: leaving to take spelling lessons
[5:23:47] Rudric_Ice: as a mage i aint taking interrupt dps loss :)
[5:24:13] starknadooo: you kinda have to take it in order to have enough points to move down the tree for most specs
[5:24:22] infinityarty: As a shaman im not taking it because dps loss
[5:24:43] SpyCrabbo: also tbf warlocks already do this in retail, i see to many sticking with the imp in m+ and not ever interrupting
[5:24:58] Beli_Mar: how much dps loss though...i highly doubt it's a deal breaking amount
[5:25:16] y0rtek: jesus christ this chat is something else sometimes...
[5:25:23] wxlfvoid: wtf is that damg dude like jesus
[5:25:23] the_bad_goat: Prot pally OP
[5:25:28] wxlfvoid: someone give the man a heal
[5:25:31] zgag: What would be a better idea with interrupts in the tree is to add some flavor to them ( if needing to talent)  IE successful interrupt gives X and X amount of extra damage.  Something along those lines
[5:25:34] s2Sammy369: as an arcane mage everything is a dps loss so im just gonna get voted out
[5:26:04] dreamwalker213: @zgag a lot of specs have that

[5:26:14] Exxcar: I think it would be cool if they wsere the "gate" talent
[5:26:18] sitmeee: make interrupts make you do more damage problem slaved
[5:26:26] Exxcar: its on the "8 required" line and is free
[5:26:27] sitmeee: solved
[5:26:31] BetsyAndCo: wait on your hunter?
[5:26:48] w0rezzz: So in 69 lvl y alredy can farm gear in heroic mod to lvl 60 , or it`s scale to yr lvl ?
[5:27:13] SpyCrabbo: if interrupts give you more dmg everyone will just always try to interrupt the first spell
[5:27:15] w0rezzz: 69*
[5:27:26] SpyCrabbo: and when the second one comes everyone has a cd
[5:27:28] Exxcar: Its a testing thing @w0rezzz . heroic won't be avaiable till max level
[5:27:35] Phalian01: hi chief  what level are you now
[5:27:45] w0rezzz: @Exxcar Sage
[5:27:48] Wheatmist: Wheatmist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[5:27:54] zgag: @dreamwalker213 Add extra amount of time with the interrupt.  Maybe the CD is 5-10 seconds less than the normal baseline cd
[5:28:04] y0rtek: you guys are actually weird. how about interrupting lets you finish the encounter? mechanics are always more important than DPS? who caresd about a single GCD (pr oGCD) being used to stop a wipe?
[5:28:13] rokss: make it like a fiery brand type deal
[5:28:22] zgag: IE if the baseline is right now at 24 secon cd it would be an interrupt with 14 sec cd
[5:28:29] zgag: second *
[5:28:41] griezel_82: Like then rogues used to tricks, the recipient got a dmg increase or reduction in wrath?
[5:28:41] Exxcar: interrupts just need to be baseline
[5:28:47] w0rezzz: True
[5:28:48] Sarocus: Interrupt? Nah, im tunnel specced
[5:28:51] Derion91: new charframe and target frame not in yet?
[5:28:51] BetsyAndCo: ^
[5:28:53] abracka_: interrupts? stuns? that's a chance i don't parse well, not on my watch
[5:28:55] s2Sammy369: which they should
[5:28:57] flebbooo: healer job now apperently KEKW
[5:28:58] y0rtek: this shit is actually crazy, that people are actually complaining about interrupts.
[5:28:59] Rudric_Ice: @RoyDuran chill out people are just discussing
[5:29:00] Exxcar: I really don't understand Blizzard's gameplan around making them optiuonal talents
[5:29:02] starknadooo: Except priests since they dont have the option too LUL
[5:29:04] chickdrummer88: DPS being selfish? *gasp*
[5:29:06] dreamwalker213: @zgag sure, I guess that can be an option. I’m just saying a lot of classes already have that kind of node you’re talking about. Whether it’s giving you more dmg for X seconds, give you focus/fury/etc
[5:29:15] griezel_82: I always spec into interrupts.
[5:29:20] Berexios123: I wouldn't mind giving holy pally an interrupt again
[5:29:21] Jarlan23: not for warriors youre basically required to get a CC to get into the 20pt tier of the tree
[5:29:27] mendlefs: going dps now
[5:29:42] swampt1l: Yep since blizzard isn’t gonna make it baseline,I’m damn well taking more damage
[5:29:56] Jarlan23: yeah it is
[5:29:59] rokss: what do you mean there are twelve separate things that need to be kicked? only tanks and some healers have those
[5:29:59] Jarlan23: on the bottom right

[5:30:13] dreamwalker213: @exxcar because a kick isn’t required for every single content in the game. Being a choice is good, players are the ones who will fuck it up
[5:30:16] starknadooo: @berexios123 According to the current tree h pally does have the option

[5:31:10] zgag: @dreamwalker213 It's an example of maybe adding something new that isn't already included with the baseline interrupt that is currently in game.  I prefer baseline, but if we are going to spec into interrupt think there needs to be something more to make it more desirable
[5:31:32] Henke1983: teleport out and in?
[5:31:35] zgag: I (
[5:31:56] dreamwalker213: @zgag like I said…those already exist lol. You need to go look at the trees again
[5:31:58] Bayne77: ooo that hammer animation is cool
[5:32:04] griezel_82: @Towelliee How are Dragon healers looking atm?
[5:32:06] LunaKura: TP out, then in?

[5:32:52] Exxcar: Not every choice is a good choice to have. If letting interrupt being a chioce is going to cause more harm than good for the general population, then it is not a good choice to provide to players. Especially when they could make the base interrupt baseline, and have the talent be some kind of added benefit

[5:34:24] abracka_: YEAH!
[5:34:28] abracka_: i just found that out the other day too
[5:34:29] zgag: @dreamwalker213 IE lets take a BM hunter's baseline interrupt.  There's no extra damage , just the interrupt.  If the BM hunter must spec into the interrupt and not the dps side of the tree it could be good to add something more to the interrupt to make it more desirable. ( Each class would be different of course)
[5:34:30] abracka_: she's amazing

[5:34:46] dreamwalker213: @exxcar why shit on blizzard for making what is a good option and not the players who are the ones who ruin it. Being a choice is a good thing, imagine having 20 raiders being able to have an extra point on a raid boss with no kicks

[5:35:23] d_elven_lord: Smokin Hawt in Ted Lasso
[5:35:33] Exxcar: @dreamwalker213 Imagine STILL having that extra point because its baseline and NO ONE has to sped a point to get it
[5:35:34] abracka_: hannah waddingham, she plays septa unella in GoT
[5:35:37] griezel_82: these bosses look undertuned...
[5:35:45] Exxcar: And it eliminates the problem of people not taking interrupt
[5:35:49] Rudric_Ice: doesn't the house of dragons show start today ?
[5:35:57] kranztheman: retail wow is losing their mind in trade chat about the AH...lol.
[5:36:21] griezel_82: I read they House of dragons is full of hardcore nudity
[5:36:21] y0rtek: @zgag thats what i was saying, but these weird takes are something else. not wanting to pick up an interrupt because they dont benefit from it is the most insane take ive seen yet. why even play an MMO if you're unwilling to participate in group content
[5:36:24] terpzz07: 14:44?

[5:37:54] godamomg: DF is kinda 3d i like it
[5:37:57] abracka_: if i don't see someone's anus tonight on house of dragon i'll stop watching
[5:37:59] SpyCrabbo: @zgag i'm serious, why do you need any other justification for it?
[5:38:02] rokss: is there any word on the new affixes for df?

[5:38:25] CodyKane: yah its out tonight
[5:38:25] Rudric_Ice: yes
[5:38:26] y0rtek: @zgag baseline is fine, but you have half the ppl in here saying they wont bother pressing it if they dont benefit from pressing the button
[5:38:30] kranztheman: 9pm east i think
[5:38:37] Aidler: sounds interesting
[5:38:50] rockhell12: westworld ended last week

[5:40:10] procyon_mfc: oh nice
[5:40:15] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the quest seems didnt count
[5:40:16] Rudric_Ice: thats cool
[5:40:22] Exxcar: This is one the coolest looking dungeons
[5:40:26] Rudric_Ice: hope they make a raid too
[5:40:27] Rottencoarse: for the brackhenhide
[5:40:32] Rudric_Ice: like asmon said
[5:40:59] dreamwalker213: @stopnsmellmynutz you’re joking right? LUL
[5:41:06] y0rtek: @zgag of course, but to hear some ppl say that blizz needs to change it because they absolutely refuse to do it is insane. dont complain about not being taken into m+ or raids if you are unwilling to be a team player, ya know?
[5:41:06] Moobot: Read all about the new Auction House changes at https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23833174/shadowlands-927-update-notes
[5:41:07] infinityarty: i wonder how % is gonna work in this dung
[5:41:35] Wcvechten: A raid that spans the entire continent and you dragonride all over it as a final raid or smth
[5:41:37] thagalvir: that would be cool, like assault on valdrakken raid
[5:42:08] kraydom: You think you do but you dont
[5:42:13] Rudric_Ice: YESSSSSSSSS
[5:42:17] xanarel22: nothing good EVER comes out of silithus SMORC
[5:42:19] kraydom: Do you not have mounts?
[5:42:26] Rudric_Ice: GIGA RAID  WITH 100 people
[5:42:49] zgag: @RoyDuran Guess we will see what happens once the talents go live during the pre-patch
[5:42:52] SpyCrabbo: meanwhile people are complaining about raid fights that last longer than 10 minutes
[5:43:23] swampt1l: 100 people in a raid and severs would die KEKW
[5:43:34] RandomXY: its balista
[5:43:36] Noshpan: If I want to spend 14+ hours in a raid, I'd go play EverQuest
[5:43:37] Rudric_Ice: honestly warfronts could have been that but they killed it
[5:43:56] wxlfvoid: Raids don't need to be longer than 10 minutes like who has time to raid for that long honestly
[5:44:13] Exxcar: This poor shaman @Towelliee slootKEKW
[5:45:00] Sarocus: If i were to start tanking.. which class would you recommend (not DH)

[5:45:20] abracka_: @Sarocus brewmaster prob
[5:45:32] y0rtek: no trash is nice, but those alliance raids in FF are boring as hell
[5:45:33] salak_daddy: l0l the AH is so messed up on retail
[5:46:32] swampt1l: but but my BOE’s :(
[5:46:37] Noshpan: I don't think that there's been a raid with trash mobs between bosses since Heavensward. And, even then, it was the Coils of Bahamut that are more like WoW raids when it comes to layout design
[5:46:39] melutz77: He's a big boy
[5:46:41] strike879: there is an easy solution just make an mechanic that kills trash for you so for sofo you could have a servitor that you repair and it kills trash for you
[5:47:06] Rudric_Ice: this guy was supposed to be a mount
[5:47:30] strike879: so there is still a feel of it being a big place but no need of actual trash being cleared
[5:47:45] Stampsha: that dungeon is almost like a mini raid :o
[5:47:48] abracka_: mf in front of you going tom cruise in top gun mode
[5:48:00] FragmentalTV: they have to be bugged tho, they should really keep the momentum, not just stop you in the tracks and propell you upward
[5:48:22] swampt1l: Yesterday I got the KSM S4 mount and Infinite Timereaver KEKE
[5:48:44] Rudric_Ice: are those new kodos ?

[5:59:11] OfficerOstrich: @Towelliee what bremaster build did you say?
[5:59:31] Crisis88: I wouldnt say getting the shaft, just more balanced. If you too strong or above average and get moved in line you always say they getting the shaft.

[6:17:37] TheCliffyShow: Right now, Blizzard are thinking, "Why did we think region-wide AH was a good idea?"
[6:17:47] ElDrakenMan: all this for a dumb app
[6:18:00] sorrel_n: Good thing they're dealing with regionwide AH bugs now and not with DF release
[6:18:10] manmower: they probably doing it to setup DF
[6:18:14] procyon_mfc: its not  the app, it's the realm link

[6:27:19] Yewturn: How does this feel in comparison to Shadowlands leveling at launch as far as time and fun?
[6:27:23] luckfore: 11 is terrible
[6:27:29] Rudric_Ice: windows 11 sucks ass
[6:27:32] luckfore: 10 is way more noob friendly
[6:27:38] Sollice: I actually just went back to 10 because I had issues with BF2042 on 11
[6:27:49] Layinthawood: 11 is literally the same as 10
[6:27:51] Timothious: Didn't they say there would be anymore versions after 10?
[6:27:51] Drizz_36: i have a little midrange PC i put together and put windows 11 on it. i haven't had any issues but i don't game on it
[6:27:56] Overhaul_1229: every time a new windows comes out its always "terrible"
[6:28:00] Timothious: wouldn't
[6:28:11] JackHealMe: I've been on 11 as an everyday user and honestly don't know what to complain about
[6:28:42] RiptoreCA: You get sent a new PC with every GPU?
[6:28:49] Rudric_Ice: thing is when u get used to one OS u are reluctant to change
[6:28:53] Berexios123: I think 11 is more optimized for gaming but I don't think it matters if you have a high end system.
[6:28:54] RiptoreCA: POGCHAMP
[6:28:58] Sollice: @Towelliee The last PC Origin gave you got rid of AMD right? So many issues you had on stream with Threadripper
[6:29:01] Rudric_Ice: thats how i am
[6:29:15] sptheory: have had w11 since it was possible to upgrade, no issues at all, playing wow gta,dota cs 1.6 / source and other random stuff

[6:30:14] RiptoreCA: @SpyCrabbo
[6:30:22] TheGiant99: @Towelliee if i dont have the Old Warriors soul on my warrior would you take it first with your coin
[6:30:34] Riggoz1: I hope that Palia MMO comes out this year, looks cool
[6:30:34] Sollice: @aumixp Look at the white numbers and guess
[6:30:43] ArcaneMaki: shot fired
[6:30:48] szble: tof blue screened me
[6:30:53] manmower: do you use raytracing?
[6:31:06] Sollice: Raytracing in WoW is terrible
[6:31:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: the processor cooler on my origin got damaged in shipping somehow, but origin got it replaced and hasnt had a problem since
[6:31:13] Sollice: half your fps for nothing
[6:31:28] HereeKittyKitty: Hey, Towlie!! Long time no talk! Figured I'd stop in and say hi.
[6:31:32] Buckwink: WoW is so intense on my PC
[6:31:37] manmower: was wondering if they set DF to make better use of it
[6:31:57] Rudric_Ice: WoW is CPU heavy not GPU
[6:32:09] luckfore: they just copy pasted the campfire LUL
[6:32:12] manmower: he's lazy, it's in his lore
[6:32:13] luckfore: and made it a dog
[6:32:13] Sollice: WoW always makes some graphics tweaks, but I would imagine DF hasnt done much for ray tracing. The big change is draw distance in DF
[6:32:15] ArcaneMaki: maybe a bug
[6:32:21] Broomba: @HaxzorJimDuggan origin pc is the best
[6:32:22] Lloydbanksz: U Watching house of dragons tonight

[6:33:07] abracka_: rings of power sept 2nd as well

[6:33:24] strike879: why do queues that takes hours pop when you go afk 1 min in
[6:33:24] SpyCrabbo: @Timothious it's different for each zone
[6:33:25] miztertea1: I saw a pre release.  It was awesome
[6:33:37] SpoofAvatar: Andor, rings of power, game of thrones, and shehulk - TV is good this fall
[6:33:38] Rudric_Ice: @berexios123 GOT is half porn so
[6:33:54] Berexios123: hell yeah that's the way I like it.
[6:33:56] Sollice: We havent watch She Hulk yet. No spoilers. I dunno if we are going to or not
[6:34:11] Sollice: @Towelliee Not based on any books. Prequels using source materia;l
[6:34:18] SpoofAvatar: shehulk episode 1 was funny
[6:34:19] Rudric_Ice: its based off of the books
[6:34:34] Sollice: There are no GoT prequel books
[6:34:36] StrawHatLuffy7: i believe grr martin he mention that the series was amazing
[6:34:53] Jarlan23: imagine if he said it was shit
[6:34:55] Buckwink: HoTD is going to be good
[6:34:59] Sollice: So its using lore he has put in his books but not actual season books like they had with regular GoT
[6:35:00] luckfore: ofcourse he says that lol
[6:35:01] Buckwink: the story is already finished so they cant fuck it up
[6:35:03] Sollice: 100 years before GoT
[6:35:07] Cortneysabeast3: 183 years

[6:36:07] ElDrakenMan: im sure george rr martin is going to trash talk his IP that makes him millions of dollars. Of course hes going to say its amazing

[6:36:17] RunningOutOfRAM: @Sollice not yet /ban sollice
[6:36:17] jkitchin75: @Sollice well played sir or madam
[6:36:21] Buckwink: Martin said around seaon 5 of GoT is when he stopped helping and if you read the series you can see that in the show
[6:36:28] Sollice: @RunningOutOfRAM Good luck!
[6:36:54] Sollice: @Buckwink He didnt have the books written for them to pull from. They had to make up their own ending
[6:37:01] TheGiant99: A RARE
[6:37:05] RunningOutOfRAM: @Sollice bezzy is my pal we will see if something can be aranged
[6:37:06] Buckwink: @Sollice exactly
[6:37:09] zgag: @DrakeDuude RR martin didn't have much to do with GOT.  Most of it wasn't his vision.  House of the dragons is closer to his vision by a long shot
[6:37:12] koorisin: @Buckwink it was more like seasons 7 and 8. around 5 they started pressuring him to creat content faster

[6:40:14] thagalvir: enough to not write anymore books

[6:40:25] BoezIRL: more than 5
[6:40:26] Nox_swe: not the right fantasy
[6:40:52] Rudric_Ice: honestly i cant wait to see the dragons in the show

[6:43:01] Yagr6: yea and eles earthquake should do the same lmao
[6:43:02] Rudric_Ice: Smaug the best dragon no shot bucko

[6:43:20] ArcaneSyntax: they should add a talent that lets it move with you
[6:43:24] A49ER08: the ice dragon in game of thrones not good enough?
[6:43:46] siickz0hniin3: !points

[6:44:15] BetsyAndCo: water looks so good
[6:44:31] Rudric_Ice: ye dr strange guy
[6:44:51] Timothious: They could just make it into a bubble instead of a ground effect

[6:46:32] codefiveone: that's about 8 hours too long for even the casual gamer imo
[6:46:40] manmower: so maybe some upgrades near the end of leveling
[6:46:50] Galadeon: 12-14 hours seems right
[6:46:51] emznev: @manmower stopp lol
