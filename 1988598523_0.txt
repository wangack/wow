[0:08:52] Bulgogiprince: Problem with League for me is if I lose I have to play until I win
[0:09:04] rucus29: @tr4ncetv not me, havent even spent any money on the game yet
[0:09:45] Bulgogiprince: @rucus29 same
[0:12:46] rucus29: has blizzard official said sod is coming out on the 30th? since last i knew they just said it was coming out the week of the 30th
[0:13:23] Calphurnious: @Bulgogiprince You ever play URF?
[0:14:15] Bulgogiprince: @Calphurnious I haven't tried it yet. I am too used to just playing ranked and being terrible
[0:15:09] Calphurnious: I personally think URF is the most fun mode. Super chaotic but can be a little woozy if you're not initially use to the speed everything is going at
[0:15:25] Cabbageman007: Did Silver Medal ever kill it yesterday?
[0:16:03] Calphurnious: There's this gentlemans agreement where everyone jumps in the cannon to the top lane and 5v5s at level 1 until the minions spawn
[0:17:27] Bulgogiprince: @Calphurnious That sounds like a wild game. I wouldn't mind trying that one.

[0:49:06] Scarhearth: @Molvonos why awakened frost of all things lol
[0:49:20] Molvonos: @Scarhearth You need a lot.
[0:49:55] Armdel: i was there!!!
[0:50:02] Scarhearth: oh right cosmic ink takes awakened frost
[0:50:09] SumZeroGG: 46 or so
[0:50:16] king_julian_96: well i have to sat iam shocked that echo won i genuinelly thought liquid had it in the bag so i was shocked when i heared the news echo got the world first kill
[0:50:31] Molvonos: Lemme break it down for you, lol.  So for Cosmic Ink, you need 1 Awakened Frost per Ink, 1 Serene Ink, and 2 Burnished Ink, and 1 Runed Writhebark.
[0:50:53] Molvonos: Each Runed Writhebark also requires a Chilled Rune, which requires 5 Rousing Frost each.
[0:50:57] Scarhearth: I bought all the mats last night ran me 1.04mil the obsidian cobraskin was 100k each
[0:51:19] BoezIRL: @Scarhearth on na?
[0:51:32] Scarhearth: @BoezIRL yep
[0:51:46] BoezIRL: @BoezIRL dam, it's 33k on eu

[0:51:57] mavericks312: this was easily the best race
[0:52:05] TweektheProphet: @Molvonos so what your saying in should be out farming mats
[0:52:06] Scarhearth: Bought em as soon as i saw the wowhead post
[0:52:22] king_julian_96: yeah but i generally thought liquid was goign to win and had it in the bag that's why i was shccked when i heard echo won
[0:52:25] Scarhearth: @mavericks312 agreed this was the best race
[0:52:37] nizzie44: nizzie44 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:52:44] DeanoTV: EU win lets gooo Clap
[0:52:48] Scarhearth: actually tbh this is the best race since Nathria
[0:52:54] Niksen_99: I feel like some nerfs this race was dumb towards echo too
[0:52:57] peinen: Didn't Echo kill Raz the very next pull after the nerf?
[0:53:03] HealsAndThat: Blizzard detecting fun and putting a stop to it, since 2004 Kappa
[0:53:09] Scarhearth: @peinen yes
[0:53:13] Molvonos: @TweektheProphet Yep.  We already have Eli loaded up with most of the farmable mats.
[0:53:26] mavericks312: the good thing about echo winning the race is they most likely come back for TWW
[0:53:28] king_julian_96: ohwell no race now untill first raid of the war within
[0:53:41] REALPolarbeezy: Not to be all tin foil... but echo killed it on the 27th and liquid killed it on the 26th.

[0:54:42] HealsAndThat: Does anybody know that, now the race is over will the hunter logs be purged? Considering the bug they had the first couple of days
[0:54:52] Niksen_99: They had 200k views last night i think they will throw in a raid or 2 for TWW KEKW @mavericks312
[0:55:01] FromageBZN: Cześć jak się masz
[0:55:03] Molvonos: @Nebulizer87 Its not a gold dump if you have a proper guild/community.
[0:55:04] jarilrpg: I love max's bait tweet saying that echo killed the boss on the 27th (local time) and liquid killed it on the 26th (local time)
[0:55:05] mavericks312: how much gold is the axe?
[0:55:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: legendary axe drops... i'm never gonna financially recover from this

[0:55:57] Nebulizer87: ~1 mill atm will prob spike next week
[0:56:00] superpudd: @mavericks312 someone priced it out earlier and its all around 1mil current market
[0:56:01] jarilrpg: @mavericks312 500k-700k
[0:56:17] HealsAndThat: Didn't they have the last big AOE at 17% instead of the desired 15?
[0:56:20] HealsAndThat: Or am I high
[0:56:22] king_julian_96: it's aroudn 500k for the axe
[0:56:26] Dudutoolbox: is enhance sham better than ele in raid?
[0:56:35] juga27: is there a time for when SOD comes out?
[0:56:36] Nebulizer87: last night u could sell shadowflames for 20k lol
[0:56:42] Scarhearth: I bought all the mats last night ran me exactly 1,023,559g
[0:57:19] king_julian_96: iam sure the gold price will go down
[0:57:28] Niksen_99: There is a clip of 1 of echos demon hunters who avoided a wipe
[0:57:34] mavericks312: for most casuals it wont be available till like the 2nd week of dec
[0:57:36] EscapePlan01: i just sold one of the scales for 32k, its being farmed to oblivioin
[0:57:41] Scarhearth: yeah lower on normal/heroic
[0:57:41] Nebulizer87: Plate armies
[0:57:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: people gonna farm the fuck out of these mounts and the prices will drop
[0:57:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: these mats
[0:57:52] peinen: Didn't Blizzard acknowledge how bad the RNG was for the evoker legendary and said they were looking to change that for this one?
[0:57:58] Nebulizer87: yup
[0:58:02] Molvonos: If it still follows the Evoker leggo, yea
[0:58:05] fizzleblast127: I thought they said they were doing this one differently than the evoker legendary?
[0:58:08] Niksen_99: Enhance top dps EZ
[0:58:08] firehawk73: is the drop personal loot?
[0:58:15] Molvonos: The drop is not personal.
[0:58:23] HealsAndThat: Yea this thing, the apocalypse, they had it at 17%, which is quite high no?
[0:58:34] DallTV_: whats a good hearler in this season ? =)
[0:58:36] BoezIRL: you should wait to buy, cobraskin jumped from 23k to 64k, there were 736 availabe the dropped to 158, so some whales are waiting
[0:58:41] EscapePlan01: nah it didnt
[0:58:41] king_julian_96: i don't know if raid finder drops the axe or not
[0:58:52] gravlaxxx: Max said on his stream it didn't hit
[0:58:58] WoW_StandalonE: it didn't hit, Max reviewed it also

[0:59:03] king_julian_96: but  i positive normal and heroci drop it aswell as mythic
[0:59:05] gravlaxxx: the effect is much skinner when you drop it
[0:59:08] mavericks312: didnt the evoker leggo drop from lfr?
[0:59:12] Niksen_99: Did you see that Liquid player who didnt keybind his seed KEKW
[0:59:16] Molvonos: @mavericks312 Yep
[0:59:17] Nebulizer87: yeah imo that looks like it shoulda been a hit
[0:59:24] Thoreya: thought scripe was gonna break his desk after the win
[0:59:31] BoezIRL: that is millimetric placement
[0:59:43] Scarhearth: if bad luck protection exists for the legendary i imagine itll be personal loot like the evoker
[0:59:44] EscapePlan01: hit seed hitbox on blaze is tiny apparently according to max

[1:00:37] gho5tfinger: gg for them tho
[1:00:42] Ilibrit: its what he said last night

[1:01:22] BoezIRL: scripe destroyed half of equipment lol
[1:01:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Incredibly tough fight with all those damned seeds
[1:01:36] BoezIRL: there's the video
[1:01:36] HealsAndThat: That headset was lost for about an hour
[1:01:37] DallTV_: and meeres got the axe hehe
[1:01:45] FleuryGG: he spiked his headset like Gronk would LUL
[1:01:46] Buttscratchrr: 24hr long days are over for them their probably happy as hell!
[1:01:52] dwolters_the_zombieman: so echo is first and liquid is second
[1:01:52] LoremasterMarthan: There's a vid, that bish went to the floor at 60mph lol
[1:01:53] ashwing_: Kinda ridiculous to have to pay 2 mil gold just to get a legendary and also have a miniscule chance to even have the item for it drop
[1:02:04] Aquadriel: driney
[1:02:08] Scarhearth: riku i think?
[1:02:08] Ticent: Scott

[1:02:12] robbo1010: Scott
[1:02:16] Nibbel__: scot
[1:02:20] Effin_Steffin: Riku won, but Scott got it
[1:02:24] DallTV_: hehe
[1:02:27] Calphurnious: @ashwing_ It's not 100% on mythic?
[1:02:29] EscapePlan01: riku won it but scott took it
[1:02:32] eakiller: not biased at al
[1:02:40] Dudutoolbox: is it 100% in mythic?
[1:02:47] Molvonos: @ashwing_ Or just farm the mats.
[1:02:48] Day_Walker78: first Mhytic kill on NA and EU it was 100% drop rate
[1:02:50] lortwulf: blood dk all day
[1:02:53] SumZeroGG: its personal loot like evoker now
[1:03:11] ashwing_: @Calphurnious sure bro you definitely get my point :)
[1:03:23] Niksen_99: Wasnt the legendary icon scuffed?
[1:03:25] Scarhearth: i imagine it wont drop for us plebs until tuesday though
[1:03:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Did you see the cost of the mats to craft it
[1:03:48] mavericks312: methods would be a chance would it not?
[1:03:51] Scarhearth: methods would be RNG i imagine?
[1:03:53] Day_Walker78: pro not
[1:03:55] Nebulizer87: curious if blizz balanlced the plate dps around that axe looking at the logs
[1:04:02] dwolters_the_zombieman: i dont know
[1:04:06] TweektheProphet: last tier it was not if i remeber right
[1:04:21] George2001k: what do we imagine the % of us lowly lfr and normal players will be to get the lego item?
[1:04:46] Molvonos: @George2001k 1% on LFR, 2% on Normal, if you didnt previously do LFR.
[1:04:58] Molvonos: If it follows the same logic as the Evoker Leggo
[1:05:04] Nebulizer87: someone mathed out the evoker blp so just look at that
[1:05:06] Mallaes: !thoon

[1:43:35] Masqerader: @Cabbageman007 what totems? from the boss with an evoker?
[1:43:39] Scarhearth: pretty much enhance rotation is PWave - Doggos - Crash Lightning - Lava lash to spread your flame shock in aoe - Lightning bolt for giga haste - Ice strike - Frost shock - then weave in lava lash and stormstrikes and repeat while spending maelstrom weapon stacks on chain lightning in AoE and Lightning bolt/Lava burst(Ele blast if talented) in ST @Sollice
[1:44:25] Scarhearth: enhance is just pretty much not overcapping your maelstrom weapon stacks and not letting hailstorm go to waste
[1:44:55] Masqerader: at least tomorrow won't be so bad for pushing, volcanic and spiteful

[1:48:22] pk99: did liquid kill?
[1:48:28] Niksen_99: They are probably just in the mood to go home
[1:48:30] melvinfart: how much time between the kills?
[1:48:43] Masqerader: Method should kill it in like 2-3 days
[1:49:00] Marcinek_xP: That race was so fun to watch.
[1:49:00] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:49:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Liquid killed it on the 26th and Echo killed it on the 27th
[1:49:10] EscapePlan01: think max just admitted they got outplayed in p3
[1:49:11] TweektheProphet: I think Max said he was going to do a final stream with the team to give there thoughts on the raid itself
[1:49:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Hmmm
[1:49:28] Thralazaar: it’ll be hard to top this rwf
[1:49:40] SamuraiWillZ916: So I found the difference between the elite and the regular heroic. So previously you could only upgrade the pvp gear with honor NOW it uses flightstones and crests like the normal so that’s great but it starts at a lower level 1/6 but heroic you get at 3/6 So in the end color and what level it starts at
[1:49:43] Sollice: I think it was too long
[1:49:44] lortwulf: so with echos win do you think that RWF is safe for now?
[1:50:04] Marcinek_xP: The ONLY thing I can see getting better would be for a global release.
[1:50:04] Niksen_99: Max said he was so happy they killed the boss because otherwise they would have to rebook flight tickets and it would cost 30k
[1:50:06] Sollice: @lortwulf You mean as an event?
[1:50:19] Scarhearth: @EscapePlan01 he did
[1:50:29] lortwulf: @Sollice yes
[1:50:38] PigPenLen: Morning T and chat! Mondays after holidays can fuck off towHi towHAMUP towLfg
[1:51:00] deckardblade: you gusy see nnoggie quit echo
[1:51:07] ArcaneSyntax: Echo won so now we're saved from echo players whining, it's just echo fans whining that we all have to deal with.
[1:51:09] Sollice: I don't think it would die as an event. If Echo turns down I think you will see people go back to Method
[1:51:17] REALPolarbeezy: Can stay home in your underwear and play too
[1:51:53] Masqerader: it's okay the shield will be in your vault tomorrow
[1:52:11] beerking2323: damn that is trinket i have been farming
[1:52:31] atsq1: I think I need to wait to pug heroic raid later in the season
[1:52:46] theonethatwas69: man holy shit... towellie always be streaming.,.. like legit ALWAYS
[1:52:46] NobodybetterPat: echo won and there fans still complaining about the delay lol
[1:52:48] Marcinek_xP: not the brick dick
[1:52:51] Niksen_99: Stop it lol. There is so many passive aggressive Liquid fans out there KEKW
[1:52:56] NickLeonhearth: We just have to endure the liquid salt now Kappa
[1:52:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Liquid got sark
[1:52:59] theonethatwas69: love it
[1:53:02] Fionas35: VoHiYo
[1:53:15] Sollice: @Niksen_99 Yes but passive aggressive is not as loud as aggressive aggressive
[1:53:18] akia03: liquid fan boys are the same aint they
[1:53:22] theonethatwas69: i hadnt played since legion
[1:53:23] NobodybetterPat: LUL
[1:53:26] mavericks312: win or lose EU just cries lol
[1:53:30] Scarhearth: my issue with EU winning is the fact that any liquid members that stream end up getting super toxic EU fans crawling in constantly
[1:53:35] Blubbernator94: it was to close cause blizzard did 2 nerfs after echo tried for 12+h and liquid just go online :o
[1:53:38] Niksen_99: Its the same if u got a brain lol @Sollice KEKW
[1:53:44] amwbadman: global release is the answer though imo
[1:53:46] ArcaneSyntax: I don't really see liquid fans complaining
[1:53:46] Sollice: @Niksen_99 It's really not
[1:54:08] RageerPLZ: I think EU should always win, gaming just more accepted in that region, breeds better players
[1:54:13] foghagymatyi: @Scarhearth cuzz it wouldn't have the exact same the othewr way around :D
[1:54:14] theonethatwas69: after Legion its always just felt so repetitive and nothing was new.. so i stopped playing
[1:54:22] Masqerader: what happens people live vicariously through things that have 0 impact on their lives... like overbearing sports parents
[1:54:22] Sollice: @RageerPLZ That's a hot take if I have seen one lol
[1:54:22] ZeusDNA: I mean, Gingi said himself that the win came down to just RNG of who got the lucky blazes/firestorms first
[1:54:24] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee did you see nick throw on seed cuz he didnt have his special action button bound?
[1:54:24] F1SH405: you should have miliseconds on the countdown Kappa
[1:54:26] medanmarko: Whoever wins and whatever happens, people will complain. But the race was fantastic, there were many great plays, good teams and exciting things to see! Gz to all who put in the effort!
[1:54:29] Thunderbrew: Is 3rd place done yet?
[1:54:41] ArcaneSyntax: @rageerplz BRUH
[1:54:44] NickLeonhearth: Well....time to buy a mythic carry for the druid form Kappa good job to the top guilds, now take my money

[1:54:47] mavericks312: idk i still feel method was a couple hrs behind
[1:54:50] Niksen_99: Echo fans had to deal with people saying all they did was yoinking strats KEKW what happened last boss
[1:54:58] ragingmel: thats not what caused that wipe LOL
[1:55:02] ShrenTheOrc: I heard Meeres didnt know what a superbloom was lol
[1:55:07] Nebulizer87: lol
[1:55:07] nevercluckyy: liquid suffered alot because they kept having a ton of death early phases that were completely avoidable for a couple of days you could noticably see max tilt and he doesnt tilt very often
[1:55:08] Blubbernator94: @NickLeonhearth true "shut up and take my money" :D
[1:55:10] akia03: you did what?
[1:55:14] ZeusDNA: @Niksen_99 I mean, that's what they did lol they just adjusted/changed the p3 strat
[1:55:20] NobodybetterPat: is there a clip of that? lol
[1:55:26] ragingmel: max said he would tweet to clarify because people were dogging on Nick and flaming him
[1:55:28] Alsparq: the second guild to see a boss will ALWAYS have less pulls
[1:55:38] Masqerader: @Thunderbrew no, method will have it in couple days
[1:55:57] REALPolarbeezy: @twinkieruler95 not what happened but ok lol
[1:56:03] George2001k: I kinda wish there was a secret phase
[1:56:11] George2001k: but it was a good raid tier either way
[1:56:12] Niksen_99: ;) @ZeusDNA
[1:56:13] SamuraiWillZ916: Echo seemed cleaner than liquid every pull
[1:56:15] Marcinek_xP: literally all teams yoink strats. I hate that this is something that has to be said every single race
[1:56:19] wowking35: BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump towLfg towLfg towLfg towLfg towLfg towLfg towNut3 towNut3 towNut3 towNut3 towNut3 towNut3 towNut3 towChad
[1:56:23] snake_like: to those people: the rest of the world yoinks liquid/echos strats and wipes 500 times for months
[1:56:25] Sollice: Thats correct. EU gets to see what NA does until NA gets stuck and they equalize. Then it's whoever is better. This is not abnormal on anything
[1:56:29] aesirsghost: Looked like Liquid got through P2 too early and never solidified it. Had a lot of trouble getting back to it each pull.
[1:56:30] ZealotryTV: idk how anyone but world first raiders find bosses like tindral or fyrakk enjoyable
[1:56:35] EscapePlan01: he didnt have it bound but it wasnt him that killed them anyway
[1:56:36] ragingmel: that isnt what caused the wipe. funny enough he would have caused a wipe if his click would ahve worked. it was true he didnt have it bound but that didnt cause the wipe
[1:56:37] duffluv22: duffluv22 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[1:56:38] snuffles_80: I hate people saying they yoink strats.. as if these guilds cant come up with the same stuff
[1:56:40] TheUnknowing: the wipe wasnt even nicks seed, that swhat max was tweeting about
[1:56:42] REALPolarbeezy: was already a wipe from something else
[1:56:49] Laelas_sm: now that the race is over retail might get some pve balancing lol
[1:56:55] Dkgungo: i think liquid tends to panic more on good attempts
[1:57:13] Masqerader: seemed like it was mostly bad storm placements a lot of the time
[1:57:13] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:57:16] nevercluckyy: wasnt the .66 wipe thd/imfireup miscommunication?
[1:57:20] Sollice: @Dkgungo I didn't watch the Echo streams but Liquid has a lot of cross talk going on their streams.
[1:57:30] Mozzeyy_: so Echo won the expansion then
[1:57:38] NobodybetterPat: gratz
[1:57:42] Dkgungo: max had to tell the boys to calm down quite a bit
[1:57:43] hoyhoy007: Nice
[1:57:49] Sollice: @Mozzeyy_  Liquid had the first 2 didn't they? If your talking about "winning" expansion
[1:57:51] ArcaneSyntax: It was literally any pull for like 6 hours for both guilds.
[1:57:52] Niksen_99: Echo didnt get to yoink any meaningful strats this race tho. Liquid turned off their stream @Sollice
[1:58:02] poorhooligans: Echo just played better on the final boss - Liquid played better on Tindral. That's pretty much it imo.
[1:58:03] fistofnature: gz
[1:58:06] Marcinek_xP: they got sloppy near the end of p3 due to nerves. You can hear max spam calling "calm down" when they were sub 15%
[1:58:09] ZeusDNA: @Sollice Echo won vault and this one so they won 2/3 raids
[1:58:18] Sollice: Liquid turned off their stream at the end for like half a day...Echo did the same.
[1:58:29] Eshel: the only way Echo could’ve killed it sooner - if their silly asses went to bed yesterday when they should have lol
[1:58:46] Sollice: @ZeusDNA Ahh ok I thought Liquid got the first 2. Again I haven't paid as much attention as years past

[1:59:27] Niksen_99: Yeah the hate towards echo is crazy lol
[1:59:42] ZeusDNA: @DrBeer134 How would you know that? Echo was muted for like 3 days KEKW
[1:59:48] NickLeonhearth: Players didn't want to get to bed, it wasn't a 1 person decision
[2:00:03] byrdeen45: now blizzard can nerf the fuck out of the last boss
[2:00:04] ArcaneSyntax: Echo spends half their stream with no comms at all LUL
[2:00:10] Sollice: @Towelliee Sleeping out of cycle even if your exhausted is hard.
[2:00:14] DrBeer134: because we’ve heard them in comms before kekw?
[2:00:20] Marcinek_xP: I think they went to bed thinking that liquid for sure was going to kill it that night.
[2:00:21] Masqerader: @Sollice nah, Blizzard giga nerfed Rasz hours before or something
[2:00:29] Eshel: it’s like any sport imo - it’s ok to have your fave but you also need to respect the winner for a job well done
[2:00:58] ronny_84: nerfed? you almost breat on them and they fall over haha
[2:00:58] mavericks312: personally bosses below smoldy dont need to be nerfed
[2:01:05] Eshel: there’s such a thing as winning and losing with grace - for fans too
[2:01:06] Masqerader: I miss when the nerfs use to happened after Ion's guild killed it
[2:01:13] ZeusDNA: @Masqerader They killed it the next pull after the nerf lol
[2:01:14] Niksen_99: I wonder how these raiders can sleep when they are like 10% hp away from the kill. I would never be able to relax lol
[2:01:21] Marcinek_xP: The real MVP is Blizz not giga nerfing the last boss mid race
[2:01:27] AlphasaurusRexx: @Masqerader they nerfed rasz hours before liquid was going to get up, and while echo was pulling. 2 pulls after nerf echo kills
[2:01:29] mavericks312: shade about to beat skyline and instant dollars to 9/9 lol
[2:01:30] Valdur359: Is the legendary obtainable only through mythic?
[2:01:37] Eggspoached: Eggspoached subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:01:39] jarilrpg: we also have that helm enchant coming in a few weeks @Towelliee
[2:01:40] ArcaneSyntax: @eshel there's also winning with grace too.
[2:01:40] snake_like: the head enchant in a few weeks will act like a soft nerf too
[2:01:52] ZeusDNA: I think the legendary won't drop until after reset
[2:01:53] Nebulizer87: im pretty sure when i watched Instant Dollars they thought the early bosses would get hotixed cuz their HP was too low
[2:01:53] AlphasaurusRexx: lfr stonks are about to go hard
[2:02:02] Sollice: is the helm enchant the visual thing your talking about?
[2:02:14] fistofnature: i just want the fyrakk mount skin
[2:02:17] fistofnature: looks dope
[2:02:17] Eshel: @arcanesyntax  - that’s what I said “winning and losing with grace”
[2:02:20] Virgilx801: Is the leggo class specific or spec specific?
[2:02:20] Mr_Pennywise_: How are well all this COLD day (in the uk anyway)
[2:02:21] ragingmel: is there a blue post confirming all that about the legendary?
[2:02:41] Mr_Pennywise_: @Mr_Pennywise_ i can not type today lol
[2:02:53] ArcaneSyntax: It'll be on the reset, not now
[2:02:56] Masqerader: guesstimation
[2:03:06] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee the guy that know everything, any tips on the neew wow prime gaming monthly thingy? :D
[2:03:07] mavericks312: ppl gearing up plate weares getting ready for the lfr
[2:03:29] ragingmel: yeah we did a normal fyrakk last night with 8 warriors in it lol

[2:05:37] Masqerader: everyone gonna be setting their loot to ret, fury, and shit no matter what they play
[2:05:39] nevercluckyy: it is kind of sad though that they made an awesome legendary axe for 2h str dps but gave all of the 2h dps the shaft
[2:05:45] nevercluckyy: takes away from the immersion
[2:05:48] ArcaneSyntax: Ret paladin stonks with legendary 📈
[2:05:50] akia03: scarlet crusade back again

[2:06:35] Mozzeyy_: EU numba one
[2:06:38] Marcinek_xP: We diodnt win VOTI so still not winning the whole thing
[2:06:38] Eshel: don’t be silly guys - Towelliie knows every minor plot point all the way up to 19.2.5 - 😝
[2:06:39] DeanoTV: EU EZ
[2:06:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: EU doesn't need to work
[2:06:58] Pharaoh_326: I wanted Liquid to win but the fact that Echo won is good for the RWF.  Maybe more will return next time
[2:07:01] Uther_The_Lightbringer: eu is just more hardcore
[2:07:02] Trestle: but na has the major advantage…..lol
[2:07:07] Thunderbrew: Why is EU better then NA?
[2:07:13] Sollice: @Marcinek_xP He is saying it would have been a 2/3 which would have been a "winning expansion"
[2:07:22] c0mmander_starscream: Go Yankees
[2:07:26] Eshel: no plot confirmed lol
[2:07:28] ArcaneSyntax: @trestle not really.
[2:07:34] Wulfgrym: suprise pictures coming to youtube soon from towelliee LUL
[2:07:35] Thoreya: mini dungeon for end of DF would be cool
[2:07:39] Marcinek_xP: @Marcinek_xP ah
[2:07:57] Sollice: I don't know how Cashman has a job after all of these years
[2:08:04] Sollice: Is he the longest running GM of all time?
[2:08:05] Wulfgrym: LUL
[2:08:06] futomara01: they better not do a watered down version of the fated coin
[2:08:22] ArcaneSyntax: Toweliee fueling another 75 bellular videos

[2:08:36] c0mmander_starscream: Fire Cashman, resurrect George Steinbrenner
[2:08:44] AlphasaurusRexx: even Gingi said Fryakk was stressful because everything and everyone had to play perfectly
[2:08:50] Kratosjr1: @Towelliee your looking good bro Lost a lot of weight and makes someone like me over 40 think he can do it as well.   Keep up the good work.
[2:08:50] duffluv22: But the Bellular content. He needs your pics...lol
[2:08:54] Thoreya: this was the highest viewed RWF yet, crazy
[2:08:54] ElmSpace: need more rock and bug pictures though
[2:09:03] ZeusDNA: Plus it's gotta be so hard to kill an insanely hard boss after the boss is killed by another guild
[2:09:13] Nebulizer87: Echo made bank on that stream ads we’re going hard
[2:09:17] Thoreya: 470k peak viewership last night for wow, insane
[2:09:20] Marcinek_xP: I will say, the best thing about Echo winning is Preach casting it
[2:09:21] Sollice: @Thoreya I think some of that also has to do with DF being a better expansion than SL also
[2:09:27] ThorH13: Hi
[2:09:29] TheUnknowing: Liquid in my opinion just tend to be more fun to watch, echo isn't nearly as fun to watch for me.
[2:09:34] letrickyxd: Liquid didn't mind losing this time, cause the race was really close and was a great race
[2:09:41] DrBeer134: yeah preach casting is awesome
[2:10:03] Thoreya: max was saying last night winning doesnt affect the org, but the viewership he said was very very good for their org

[2:10:21] Breaker_Asylum: Good morning!
[2:10:23] letrickyxd: minded a little yeah, but the vibes were all great, sorry but sentence LUL
[2:10:26] AlphasaurusRexx: did you see the toredo family meme of the last cinematic after kill?
[2:10:26] WoW_StandalonE: Max was devastated
[2:10:28] letrickyxd: *bad lmfao
[2:10:35] Thoreya: it peaked at 470k lol
[2:10:37] Thoreya: it was not low
[2:10:44] devilhawk83: Preach is a very good caster and even Naguura complimented Preach well in Exho’s casting
[2:10:49] Sollice: @Thoreya He means in Liquids streams
[2:11:04] StoneFaceWoW: No comms on stream though, who wants to watch that
[2:11:06] Thoreya: @Sollice meh, max was peaked at 110k, liquid was at 65k
[2:11:07] Choppsuuey: But their broadcast team sucked. I prefer Method/Liquid Casters over Echo
[2:11:08] Nebulizer87: they invested in casters and the show
[2:11:10] Thoreya: numbers were pretty even
[2:11:11] Breaker_Asylum: man, i have so many bad memories of this dungeon from bfa.
[2:11:15] Alienfromger: echo had preach
[2:11:18] Alsparq: liquid loses 2/3 of its viewers to Max
[2:11:26] Dragunstorm15: Ya I feel like liquids “main channel” is max
[2:11:32] Eshel: what was odd to me - Maximum had more viewers than the Liquid page
[2:11:33] Laelas_sm: liquids loses a lot to maxs stream
[2:11:37] Dkgungo: i never watch the liquid channel only max's stream
[2:11:47] ZeusDNA: I think more people watch Max's stream because they wanna hear the funny ass shit they say KEKW
[2:11:54] Lausten: Yeah man! Think of my feelings! SMOrc
[2:12:15] Thoreya: i disagree. max having 110k and liquid having 65k last night. compared to echos 150k and gingis 15k
[2:12:19] Thoreya: pretty similar
[2:12:25] nevercluckyy: liquids main channel's issue is people want to watch the race and 95% of what is on liquids channel during the race isnt even pulls

[2:12:45] Sollice: @Towelliee I wonder if Max had something in his contract to keep his stream
[2:12:47] DrBeer134: echo def had better casters
[2:12:51] HaloS23: I enjoyed watching Liquid on Max's stream. I especially like listening to Max and the team talk and banter. Ill pass on lstening to Preach and Fatboss
[2:12:52] Masqerader: shield
[2:12:56] PigPenLen: it wasn'
[2:13:03] DrBeer134: max was more entertaining than liquids casters
[2:13:03] Mozzeyy_: the production on Echo channel is just so much better
[2:13:07] PigPenLen: it wasnt good casting either
[2:13:13] Mozzeyy_: casters are way better etc

[2:13:52] Masqerader: we get to watch max, watch firedup
[2:14:04] jarilrpg: jak and sloot was peak MDI
[2:14:09] Lulaboo: some people dont like to see caster and just want to see a non poduction pov
[2:14:11] Sollice: Personally, I more enjoy watching it through Max because that is more of what we come to expect from Twitch. We watch individuals on their channels.
[2:14:11] clambynature: very self centered for a leader of a raid organization that’s trying to complete for stuff..
[2:14:13] Holysal: Yeah Jak got screwed over
[2:14:14] biirrd: he will be, that is solved now
[2:14:24] Sollice: I am not really a caster viewer on Twitch
[2:14:25] ArcaneSyntax: Firedup makes me feel insecure as a wow player
[2:14:31] foghagymatyi: Jeath is the goat tought, so much inside and such a good voice
[2:14:36] Holysal: @biirrd they arent hiring him back though
[2:14:43] DrkPhoenix6913: doesnt hurt im already subbed to max, so i can avoid all the ads :P  rather than sub to another channel :P
[2:14:45] Sollice: @clambynature Whats self centered?
[2:14:55] Kisswani: @ArcaneSyntax LUL yeah it seems he has some extra secret buttons not available to the rest of us
[2:15:01] Breaker_Asylum: I thought i saw the last of this dungeon  at the end of bfa... and it's still mythic + :'(  so many bad memories of thgis dungeon and bfa
[2:15:07] jarilrpg: @Lulaboo thats me, i dont care about the banter and stuff of the casters, in fact its annoying to me, would rather just hear the strats and calls from the guild's comms
[2:15:09] raldrik: Echo's layout was also better. The clear view of boss %, lust and Brez made the picture in picture bearable. On liquid it was hard to see
[2:15:16] Sollice: @jarilrpg Same
[2:15:18] Niksen_99: Yesterday Liquid was having like 2-3 breaks while Echo was ahead and chain pulling. Thats prob the difference too
[2:15:34] Sollice: @Niksen_99 I said that last night. Liquid was slow pulling
[2:15:34] Moobot: towLoot Every month you get a free Twitch Sub with Prime Gaming and now available with Prime Gaming, WoW: Armored Bloodwing Mount Get it at https://gaming.amazon.com/wow and throw your SUB at https://www.twitch.tv/subs/towelliee towLoot
[2:15:38] ragingmel: are you hunting Rezan's?
[2:16:00] ZeusDNA: Yeah definitely sad we won't see another RWF until after 11.0 launch
[2:16:33] AlphasaurusRexx: @Niksen_99 they had over 100 more pulls than echo, it didnt matter
[2:16:37] jdgdragoon: Morning
[2:16:42] Sollice: @Osilon33 You didn't do anything wrong. We just had that conversation earlier and dont want to restart it
[2:16:44] Thoreya: seeing qwik posting a screenshot last night of thr 470k viewers was cool too
[2:16:47] Eshel: ow let’s get a reality show race - where we get to see mid level guilds just lose their shit at each other during pulls lmao
[2:17:02] Dropzone34: this race was beast mode
[2:17:05] Dropzone34: and it was close
[2:17:30] Masqerader: most people probably didn't watch until they started seeing sub 10% on raider.io and shit, I know I didn't
[2:17:31] Osilon33: @Sollice i missed it.. i got berated yesterday saying this same thing asking another streamer their thoughts lol
[2:17:47] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, a close race is more interesting than a blowout
[2:17:47] Merkuriuz: @Dropzone34 it was basicly down to not having a keybind for seed KEKW atleast thats what ive seen
[2:17:47] Sollice: @Osilon33 Yeah it just doesn't lead to anything productive at this point. Just argueing
[2:18:00] sdpercussion: This race was hugely entertaining. People should have nothing but good vibes about it.
[2:18:16] Zeakon92: EU > NA :)  Gj to Echo of being underdog and win
[2:18:19] Dropzone34: @Merkuriuz yeah I noticed that as well when I was watching it last night
[2:18:25] Breaker_Asylum: Atal is a dungon thwat always piunished mistakes hard as heck, especially mythic atal
[2:18:35] Thoreya: echo underdog? lol
[2:18:44] jarilrpg: @Merkuriuz max showed that on stream, it wasn't the lack of keybind that wiped them, another seed got hit right before that
[2:18:45] ArcaneSyntax: @zeakon92 echo is not an underdog KEKW
[2:18:50] Molvonos: Man, I sure do love teleporting into the bosses mouth.

[2:18:58] mikejensenn24: @Zeakon92 Underdog?? What u on?
[2:19:15] Molvonos: @Zeakon92 Uh.  Can I have what you're smoking please.
[2:19:27] Dropzone34: have they come out and said when the lego quest or when or how the lego will be aobtained
[2:19:32] letrickyxd: underdogs? LUL
[2:19:35] TheUnknowing: echo is far from an underdog
[2:19:41] GameWithDerp: yea, thats not how underdogs work lol
[2:19:45] Sharkeys: KEKW what was mainly old method being called underdogs
[2:19:45] Nebulizer87: method is the underdog
[2:19:45] ragingmel: @Dropzone34 nothing yet
[2:19:46] TweektheProphet: method is and will probably always be the underdog
[2:19:49] Sollice: @Dropzone34 Meers started lego quest last night
[2:19:52] TheUnknowing: method or one of the others would be considered underdogs, not liquid or echo lol
[2:19:56] NobodybetterPat: lol delusional
[2:20:03] GameWithDerp: instant dollars would be an underdog
[2:20:07] Dropzone34: @Sollice oh ok
[2:20:07] REALPolarbeezy: Instant Dollars would be an underdog
[2:20:09] dimofodi: I would consider them both the top dogs. The only issues is what happens when Liquid kills it first but Echo does it in less time/pulls than Liquid.
[2:20:10] Niksen_99: From the start they are def underdog
[2:20:10] Eshel: that was a seriously even matched race - the closeness proves it
[2:20:15] jarilrpg: @Dropzone34 there is a post about it on wowhead
[2:20:17] Nebulizer87: I hope for a Method upset next year to shake things up a little bit
[2:20:17] Masqerader: bdg is an underdog, Method is an underdog
[2:20:22] NobodybetterPat: liquid and echo is the main event. everyone else is the underdogs
[2:20:27] Dropzone34: @jarilrpg right on
[2:20:28] Vohodian: method is the underdog.
[2:20:43] mavericks312: in no world is liquid or echo underdogs lol
[2:20:49] MrTrevinoo: i want to see echo on NA reset and see how much quicker they clear it than Liquid. they would seem miles ahead of everyone else
[2:20:55] GuRu_gg: NA got patch early to didnt they haha
[2:20:56] mavericks312: method,bdg,instant dollars are underdogs
[2:21:03] Eviltuna13: not really underdogs because the first 4 days is splits
[2:21:06] Niksen_99: Imagine a race where both teams are in the same building on the same server
[2:21:06] Darwoo: splits ruin any competition
[2:21:07] Sollice: @MrTrevinoo This is not true
[2:21:08] dimofodi: The whole can't pull a boss is nonsense though, they go right into M+ and keep gearing. Echo starts like 16 hours behind and can't do anything during that time to work on it.
[2:21:09] Eshel: was like watching Ali vs Fraser - no matter who your favorite is you’re going to see a good fight :)
[2:21:32] sdpercussion: @GuRu_gg That slight advantage is negated by having to wait on bug fixes
[2:21:32] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:21:32] Holysal: global release
[2:21:34] OnePlayerPete: 'simple'
[2:21:35] Molvonos: More Cowbell?
[2:21:35] Sollice: Liquid and Echo, if the way Blizzard releases the raids, are NEVER going to be first on the first...what 5 bosses...they play the long game and do splits
[2:21:45] ambiotic: Frank Reich got fired
[2:21:47] letrickyxd: @dimofodi and yet they seem to always be within 0.2 avg ilvl of each other, that's a cap
[2:21:50] GuRu_gg: this time
[2:21:55] Sollice: The other guilds are going in with what gear they have right away to knock out some early bosses and get firsts
[2:22:05] REALPolarbeezy: merge them and it would be better health for the game and community
[2:22:09] MrTrevinoo: @Sollice I only make this statement because they always manage to come out ahead. its hard to guage a real result but Echo prove what they can do with 1 day delay
[2:22:12] DRS8Sonic: yep, just happened
[2:22:12] ambiotic: didnt even finish the first year
[2:22:20] Holysal: @ambiotic so dumb. the coaching staff wanted Stroud and the owner wanted Young and he pays the price lol
[2:22:37] mavericks312: reichs career went downhill after leaving philly
[2:22:47] dimofodi: @letrickyxd It's still not time where they can make literally zero progress like Echo has with the server maintenance time.
[2:22:49] Sollice: @MrTrevinoo Yeah but thats just not the way the raids are setup right now. I wish they would do Normal, LFR and Heroic week 1 and Mythic week 2
[2:22:53] Eviltuna13: best solution is to have normal and heroic release on the same day and mythic the next week on Wednesday
[2:22:58] Sollice: Watching splits so boring
[2:23:05] Sollice: @Eviltuna13 this
[2:23:14] mavericks312: yea reich was setup to be fired when the whole staff wanted stroud but they went young instead
[2:23:33] AlphasaurusRexx: i always have to tod one of these totems as a tank because people blast 2 of them down while the weakest dps struggles to ST the third
[2:24:05] ArcaneSyntax: I think we get global release next expansion
[2:24:09] Molvonos: @AlphasaurusRexx That's why I always communicate.  As an Aug, I struggle with the totems, so if I say something, I get help.
[2:24:18] Keyastaron_: Patch you mean
[2:24:25] Masqerader: week 2 of the patch you mean, not expansion
[2:24:26] PvtHudson093: I was saying last pull before I go to bed and Echo did it
[2:24:29] Dropzone34: smolderon is a cuck
[2:24:31] Recording_on_the_grass: will be nothing to do in a few weeks
[2:24:38] Molvonos: Bootleg Ragnaros
[2:24:40] AlphasaurusRexx: @Molvonos i always try to help the aug but then im left with nobody interrupting the boss XD
[2:24:49] Bulgogiprince: Do you think then that it's so easy now to get to 6/9 that they won't bother nerfing the others as it's good enough to have other guilds take their time to clear the raid
[2:24:52] Nebulizer87: Painsmith PTSD
[2:25:02] snake_like: you underestimate my cutting edge guild that takes until the last few weeks to get it
[2:25:14] nevercluckyy: the fights are fun just piss easy up until smoldy
[2:25:17] TheUnknowing: I think the raid is pretty fun as a whole
[2:25:19] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[2:25:22] Keyastaron_: oh yea i got normal first week of the patch on 2 toons
[2:25:23] dimofodi: I think they more so want the bossses to scale in difficulty in a linear pattern instead of having a 4th boss take 400 pulls then get the next 2 in likeless than 50 pulls each.
[2:25:26] mavericks312: honestly just let the painsmith and halondrus guy design the next raid on his own
[2:25:32] Nebulizer87: painsmith disbanded my long time guild lol

[2:26:12] EndureZg: GG ECHO
[2:26:19] darkrowse21: that was a really close race gg both teams
[2:26:39] Nebulizer87: Fryakk p3 gonna kill some guilds pass fail mechanics always cause friction
[2:26:48] snake_like: oh yeah we did extendo after zskarn for a lonnggg time
[2:27:08] Masqerader: @Nebulizer87 p3 will be nerf into oblivion soon
[2:27:30] JoshuaTree6969: Panthers are a poverty franchise
[2:27:38] JoshuaTree6969: Ownership is a clown show
[2:27:39] beerking2323: man Nymue is a pug killer for some reason
[2:27:51] kimmo_gaming: RDPS on council is like chilling LOL
[2:28:02] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Bring back sofo
[2:28:04] shale93: yeah nymue sucks with pugs on HC
[2:28:32] Breaker_Asylum: I had to teach a guildie atal'dazar mechanics... it was... rough

[2:30:13] Reckless_Monk: did he talk about Nnoggie quitting Echo and WF raiding?
[2:30:13] Nebulizer87: hard agree the worst visual room clarity
[2:30:14] OhNoNotAgain: Blizz loves similar colors on top of each other
[2:30:14] Sollice: They have to fix all of the shit going on the ground
[2:30:17] Nevindaz: that fight lags my pc sometime very weird
[2:30:22] Sollice: Its not clever game mechanics....its sloppy design
[2:30:26] AlphasaurusRexx: between that fight, volocross, smolderon, and a few dungeons this season
[2:30:30] Nevindaz: didnt happ on any raid
[2:30:31] ragingmel: heard you like red on orange on burnt orange on darker red on lighter red
[2:30:35] Scarhearth: nymue is awful. bright green on green. great...
[2:30:38] Eshel: as melee - I LOATHE the beams
[2:30:40] Dropzone34: I turned my particle density down to deal with the cluter
[2:30:41] Nebulizer87: I mean Noggie needed to quit years ago for his mental that man tilts
[2:30:58] nevercluckyy: the fact that on tindral 90% of people use inky black potion is ridiculous
[2:32:07] Nebulizer87: we are now sick of green and red thanks legion and Dragonflight
[2:32:39] Nebulizer87: I’m not looking forward to healing smolderon
[2:32:42] PvtHudson093: Scripe spiking the headset made my night

[2:42:25] Attackroot: yup, alot of stores the tv they sell at black friday price will be that price in a few months anyway
[2:42:28] Scarhearth: @Bowwjack i imagine it might end up being personal loot after tuesday
[2:42:28] Nebulizer87: yeah Target one went viral
[2:42:35] PvtHudson093: First drop is tradable
[2:42:39] ZeusDNA: I think the world first was tradable
[2:42:40] Frenaris: @tonyr23 been like that since forever
[2:42:41] Plague_Wall: The evoker weapon was the same way when it dropped first
[2:42:45] loragheta: scot yoinked it
[2:42:45] Attackroot: @Towelliee the first one is a drop just like evoker lego. but they may make it personal loot soon.
[2:42:46] ZeusDNA: Then for others it will be personal
[2:42:47] Plague_Wall: Just the first drop
[2:42:54] ZeusDNA: That's how the Evoker one went I believe
[2:42:55] foghagymatyi: its not liek normal is tough? like you cant need on it
[2:43:02] Nebulizer87: shoulda let Driney go Ret everyone is miserable playing Hpal in raid atm
[2:43:06] loragheta: probably personal loot on reset

[2:43:20] Mecabeast: I have 6 people to roll against in my guild if that's the case

[3:31:36] opalwinfrey: For upper deck, do you have a referral link?  Going to purchase some packs!
[3:31:38] 3663Sharad: Meeres does that already on farm
[3:31:38] populuxxe: Especially since Cro retired from raiding.
[3:31:42] WoWDooley: Meres is moving to healing call out
[3:31:45] ArcaneSyntax: I really hope Liquid invests into a dungeon team for TGP and MDI
[3:31:46] Getitonthelow: I thought Max guild was limit or something
[3:31:46] Towelliee: !blizzard

[3:31:47] GingerPurple: He does when scripe/roger are in meetings and they are still pulling
[3:31:51] snake_like: what kind of copium is "they came in 2nd but they didn't lose" lmao. cmon I want NA to win, but that's cope man
[3:32:10] WoWDooley: Method used to be Echo till... politics
[3:32:26] ArcaneSyntax: @WoWDooley that's an interesting framing...
[3:32:31] populuxxe: @WoWDooley Not really.
[3:32:53] MaleFrom73: selling these boxes is like printing money
[3:33:00] sigilla_: isn’t the average age older on echo side vs liquid? they could have more retirerees
[3:33:03] WoWDooley: @populuxxe go on then why do you think everyone left method to form echo?

[3:33:49] SpudPT: Scribes??
[3:33:49] WoWDooley: @populuxxe cos people always leave guilds when they are having fun right?
[3:33:50] Niksen_99: Pretty sure scripe is like 25
[3:33:51] ArcaneSyntax: max is older than everybody who raids in the guild
[3:34:05] jshukster: second place is the first loser
[3:34:07] Mostdangspy: If you aint first your last!
[3:34:09] Attackroot: isnt  second just first loser?
[3:34:12] ShrenTheOrc: if your not first your last
[3:34:13] Rudric_Ice: As Ricky Bobby said
[3:34:15] kaeleirra: If you're not first you're last
[3:34:16] th3janitor: 1st loser
[3:34:17] JohnShenlon: if you’re not first you’re last
[3:34:21] the_general01: at least they finished, unlike jailor
[3:34:23] force_FMD: We are all winners
[3:34:24] populuxxe: Correct way to say that would be the members of Echo are mostly former Method members that left on good reason. Leaving a guild because they turned a blind eye to a member doing some absolutely awful shit isn
[3:34:25] Rudric_Ice: IF YOU AINT FIRST YER LAST
[3:34:29] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: But Liquid killed it on the 26th
[3:34:30] populuxxe: 't "leaving because politics."
[3:34:36] thebeanspace: "if you ain't first you're last" shake n bake baby
[3:34:39] Buttscratchrr: it's okay to lose! nothing wrong with that just try again!
[3:35:02] kaeleirra: I'm all hyped up on mtn dew
[3:35:02] xALcaPWNedx: I love playing wow on an ultra wide monitor - so freaking cool!!
[3:35:02] Keyastaron_: time to relcear Kapap
[3:35:03] WoWDooley: @populuxxe yep i was being sensitive to the triggers
[3:35:05] Keyastaron_: Kappa
[3:35:08] snake_like: guy claiming politics probably thinks josh being a piece of shit is "cancel culture". get outta here
[3:35:22] populuxxe: @WoWDooley So... "Because politics?"
[3:35:25] PvtHudson093: " Ask any racer, any real racer. It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning.""
[3:35:28] Folgrum: echo got less pulls too i think. very close race
[3:35:30] the_general01: i havent watched that much wow in years
[3:35:35] Buttscratchrr: other then raiding 20plus hrs aday LUL LUL  nothing to crazy
[3:35:39] Snabido: Drama is in the aftermath, any moment someone leaks Kappa
[3:35:42] Niksen_99: Yeah only the usual viewer drama NA VS EU LUL
[3:35:46] WoWDooley: @populuxxe is better that saying the real reason
[3:36:04] KiLLMasTer20: There's no participation trophy for RWF
[3:36:12] ArcaneSyntax: hitting the divine shield button too hard for us rets sometimes
[3:36:21] populuxxe: @WoWDooley But it's also not even saying anything related to the real reason. A better way to frame that would have been something like "because of drama."
[3:36:33] Masqerader: cardio day, what better way to get motivated to run, have a big ass dinosaur chase you
[3:36:52] populuxxe: Saying "because politics" means you're saying because of disagreement basically. LOL.
[3:37:05] populuxxe: Just a tad more than that is all.
[3:37:11] WoWDooley: @populuxxe fair
[3:37:15] nevercluckyy: fyrrak was the real makgora echo said fyrrak dies or we die whichever is first LUL very entertaining race though
[3:37:34] 91Niki: Almost got nommed
[3:37:45] populuxxe: Love devour power. Idk hose those two are still fit.
[3:37:56] Folgrum: close race so no drama i guess
[3:37:57] 91Niki: I was just about to say LUL
[3:38:04] Niksen_99: There is drama
[3:38:04] Samaellus: well, there was drama
[3:38:14] Keyastaron_: they played better if liqwuid got that 0.6 % they would have won
[3:38:14] ArcaneSyntax: echo fans still bitching, but there's not really drama
[3:38:15] 91Niki: If NA had won EU would have been crying a river about NA getting 1 day early access to the raid KEKW
[3:38:19] WoWDooley: no drama cos both guilds on the same point on the final boss for a similar number of runs
[3:38:27] ParfumAmerican: true
[3:38:32] WoW_StandalonE: half of liquid is EU soon
[3:38:35] Outerlaw: plumprMurica plumprMurica plumprMurica plumprMurica plumprMurica plumprMurica plumprMurica
[3:38:37] jaykodiak: jaykodiak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[3:38:38] 91Niki: EU fanboys are just some drama cry babies if they don't win
[3:38:38] sigilla_: do you think we will ever see global release?
[3:38:39] populuxxe: There was drama, but like... Almost really big drama. That nerf at the end of Echo raid day when Liquid was just starting was sketch.
[3:38:59] REALPolarbeezy: Someone asked Max earlier if they would raid on EU like echo did and he laughed and said no why would i want to do that
[3:39:01] raltpeter: blasted red coats..
[3:39:03] Folgrum: just open mythic raid at same hour by blizzard, no more drama. simple
[3:39:03] davysaurus: how much more time did Liquid end up taking - granted they probably didn't grind as hard
[3:39:07] OhNoNotAgain: @populuxxe and what would you call what happened in vault?
[3:39:07] TurtleThumbWar: Nice jersey - D.Strawberry? lol
[3:39:09] snake_like: how it works with most EU versus NA stuff. you can joke about NA, but the moment you joke about EU they go ballistic lmao
[3:39:12] YoFrankFrost: Liquid needs to just do races off stream.
[3:39:13] Niksen_99: Feel like thats some NA copium to make it feel less bad to lose KEKW
[3:39:29] TurtleThumbWar: ALL RISE

[3:39:30] WoWDooley: @populuxxe echo did themselves in almost on that one boss on the reclear
[3:39:31] FrankTizzle: @YoFrankFrost Then they won't make money
[3:39:40] populuxxe: @REALPolarbeezy Why would they do that though? What a silly thing to ask him.
[3:39:48] Mikromanagement: echo had their buttons bound thats why they won EZ
[3:39:51] ArcaneSyntax: @snake_like and for some reason always devolves into them yelling about dead children
[3:40:03] REALPolarbeezy: @populuxxe because it was hinted at they would alternate for races.
[3:40:09] Se7enthSinn: NY Mets Ohtani Jersey coming soon
[3:40:27] 3663Sharad: Echo had some serious issues on reclear  T.Swift, could have go doownhill pretty early
[3:40:28] Niksen_99: wtf ? weird @ArcaneSyntax
[3:40:29] YoFrankFrost: @FrankTizzle They make plenty of money still.

[3:40:56] jesse_fantasy: Rezzan is one blind mf
[3:40:56] populuxxe: @REALPolarbeezy .... But the only reason Echo did it was to just try the bosses on heroic earlier than they could in EU... How could Liquid even do that when it unlocks a day later?
[3:41:10] ullerickdj: ullerickdj subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[3:41:14] REALPolarbeezy: @populuxxe youre missing the point
[3:41:16] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Ohtani wants to stay in California
[3:41:22] Se7enthSinn: The Mets are spenders now. The Wilpons are out
[3:41:36] populuxxe: @REALPolarbeezy I think you are actually... They didn't race on NA.
[3:41:37] ArcaneSyntax: @Niksen_99 see this shit all the time, nice banter on something benign like food, and then the EUer comes in with a "well EU doesn't have school shootings or some shit.
[3:41:38] Niksen_99: Look at your chat and tell me there isnt drama KEKW so many salty liquid fans aswell as echo
[3:41:41] TurtleThumbWar: CLEAN totem clear
[3:42:56] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also Zaelia was sick during Tindral and Fyrakk

[3:43:22] snake_like: there'd be less salt if winners would just not be sore winners if that makes sense. happens with NA and EU
[3:43:29] YoFrankFrost: @Niksen_99 If you saw Maximums tweet, you'd know that he felt their strats were being yoinked. Part of the races I guess. The only thing to do is not stream it. But this isn't the first time Liquid lost due to strats being copied.
[3:43:30] Outerlaw: be real, liquid played better
[3:43:31] Masqerader: @Niksen_99 who cares? People like to live through other peoples achievements and failures cause they have nothing else to look forward to.
[3:43:41] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee I don't think thats true.  I think yesterdays win came down to who could win the RNG seed race
[3:44:12] jmalmin: Atleast Echo and Liquid both made the end of this race interesting.
[3:44:14] sigilla_: Max said in his stream after their kill he thought echo’s strat for P3 was better than theirs
[3:44:19] Dark_Kornax: both EU/NA were in the kill range for many hours.  it was 100% luck/chance
[3:44:20] superpudd: Is that healers name Murderpuss?? lol
[3:44:35] 91Niki: @superpudd Yep KEKW
[3:44:50] Mikromanagement: @Niksen_99 strats being "yoinked" is such a funny coping mechanism to me, its almost like people forget who has dominated the RWF space for the last 10 years, they dont need to yoink anything
[3:45:05] Niksen_99: Truuuuuuuue @Mikromanagement

[3:46:32] reedthesham: Retail pvp
[3:46:36] Niksen_99: Echo obv played better overall tho
[3:46:51] snake_like: claiming RNG in an mmorpg that has plenty of DPS variance because of crit/proc RNG is just dumb. I wanted Liquid to win, but it's cope. Echo was the better build
[3:46:59] falldrgn: Both teams played Extremely well.
[3:47:08] Wulfgrym: i don't care who won, that last boss was nuts and both of them did amazing
[3:47:18] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Amen

[3:53:23] Fromanwild: Would just be tanking mythic+ and maybe heroic raids on bear
[3:53:28] sinlesssinner: @Breakadinn is that what that is?!! wow didnt know
[3:53:37] akia03: or the hunter rocket thing?
[3:54:20] Breakadinn: @sinlesssinner If  I'm understanding correctly that's what it is.  Were they using it on the adds during intermissions?
[3:54:31] mavericks312: interesting he says quit and not retire
[3:54:36] jeffnsteff2019: Think limit ran out of energy and were little shook up when echo got him at 1 percent
[3:54:54] akia03: could also be the hunter weapon chant thing the safe rockets
[3:55:17] mavericks312: @jeffnsteff2019 theyw erent shook that had a 1% pull as well echo just played better
[3:55:33] akia03: does the knock fire rockets?
[3:55:39] sinlesssinner: @Breakadinn oh no, i saw it as a proc thing, a rocket shoots to the target, Xerwo was using it, gingi also
[3:55:50] sinlesssinner: so not sure wtf it is lol
[3:55:53] 91Niki: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/nnoggie/status/1729136977239576723

[3:56:37] Mostdangspy: So did liquid get the 0.66% before echo killed it?
[3:56:39] mavericks312: the 9% on sark totally rattled echo
[3:56:41] OlleverTV: What class are going to play in SoD?
[3:56:45] idenkaz_: i think Echo didnt expect that 6 & from liquid so suddenly
[3:56:51] WoW_StandalonE: @Mostdangspy no
[3:56:56] falldrgn: Well Liquid has a tendancy to go dark then  have crazy pulls
[3:57:22] sinlesssinner: @chat thx for the help :)
[3:57:29] mavericks312: an he says quit so i expect him to go somewhere else
[3:57:33] so_much_this: at one point yesterday echo and liquid were like .07 percent away from world first … my heart was like whut
[3:57:42] sakura_2020: noggie had 8 dk's geared lol
[3:57:49] dexxzor: justwait does or not?
[3:57:49] mavericks312: noggie going back to method
[3:57:52] falldrgn: I remeber him getting benched in EP or was it CN? cause he said something stupid
[3:57:56] Rottencoarse: yup
[3:57:58] populuxxe: Noggie doesn't do their WA anymore. He focus on MDT.
[3:58:06] Rottencoarse: he didnt get to play this tier
[3:58:08] Tsrif: Noggie didn't do their WA's

[4:00:39] dimofodi: Isn't Instant Dollars where they all basically go to retire from RWF where they want to still do CE on a high level but not push it like RWF?
[4:00:48] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  appereantly Nnoggie doesnt do their weakaura anymore
[4:00:49] ambiotic: Well that is pretty much market standard for engineers, so prob going to get that bag coding

[4:01:07] sinlesssinner: if it was 100k @Towelliee would be on that like white on rice :p
[4:01:07] Crafty_plays: There were at least 5 pulls yesterday for Liquid where it was just 1 mistake that had it not happened they would have killed the boss. Same thing happened to echo multiple times as well. Aside from 1 pull I don't think you can say one team played "better" than the other. All around it was a damn good race though
[4:01:08] falldrgn: wasn't it $$$ and travel was  better
[4:01:12] fetza108: naguura spies here KEKW
[4:01:15] populuxxe: Kids don't know how money works RL.
[4:01:19] Hippwn: Echo didn't give her more money though it was just convenience
[4:01:27] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  she also left TL this  year
[4:01:32] Nuvene: hell one night after another streamer raided her nagura went on a 20 minute rant about how she hates people from NA
[4:01:35] 91Niki: Made money off that video too LUL
[4:01:37] xRykku: lol also pretty sure nobody gave a fuck lol
[4:01:38] ercki89: For sure :D
[4:01:39] ambiotic: and didnt have to travel to the US
[4:01:40] PigPenLen: says more about her community tbh
[4:01:43] shale93: unethical how could she Kappa
[4:01:48] Fugazi811: who asked?
[4:01:49] joeeb58: like a job :D
[4:02:03] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  2 years with TL
[4:02:11] so_much_this: damn man can I be a caster I’ll do it for free just room and board a week away from kids that sounds great
[4:02:13] Fugazi811: simps
[4:02:14] Milkman3447: Jobs a job. Money is better go that route!
[4:02:19] Rhoncer: some people are wild about this race
[4:02:20] mavericks312: she probably had NA peeps trolling
[4:02:22] azzurrin: fired Frank Recht already
[4:02:23] REALPolarbeezy: side switcher
[4:02:24] Wulfgrym: traitor KEKW
[4:02:32] Jetdrata: !ebay
[4:02:32] Moobot: @Jetdrata Interested in Towelliee's cards for sale on Ebay from his sports card rip streams? Check out his ebay store to see available cards and bid today! https://www.ebay.com/usr/tankbreak
[4:02:40] Nehcrom: Gotta respect the hustle.
[4:02:41] Dred_Scythe: Really paying attention to Echo/Liquid this race, the pull logs really reflect how "bursty" Liquid can be at pulling a Boss kill "out of no where" with Echo being more consistent in getting to and staying within a phase once they get there. Cool to see, enjoyed this race a lot.
[4:02:43] fetza108: maybe she is more comfortable to cast for an eu guild and maybe she feels better with those casters and team
[4:02:49] Outerlaw: true
[4:02:53] so_much_this: money talks
[4:02:58] 91Niki: Throwing the word traitor around tells me that you've never worked a real job before or have no clue how they work. People go where it pays better
[4:03:02] akia03: wasnt she at blizcon anyway
[4:03:06] Rhoncer: probably exposure too since echo stream has more viewers than liquid official one
[4:03:06] Sollice: @fetza_twitch No she is a professional. Money talks as it should
[4:03:09] grubzy_1: nothing wrong with that
[4:03:09] fetza108: just money? i dont know
[4:03:12] Fugazi811: Preach made a lot of race videos
[4:03:14] grubzy_1: gotta pay the bills
[4:03:15] Wulfgrym: she did say she preferred staying in eu to cast instaead of travelling to LA and screwing up her sleep schedule
[4:03:16] sigilla_: she said she would have had to stay in the us after Blizzcon and she did not want to stay that long
[4:03:20] jeffnsteff2019: Tis time for toxicity after RWf
[4:03:23] Ranthyr_: People fail to realize that feelings dont make you money to live, Gotta follow the bread
[4:03:26] shale93: they like them more obviously Kappa
[4:03:36] Sollice: @Fugazi811 What do you mean you dont know. She doesn't live off retiurement
[4:03:38] fetza108: @fetza_twitch i see i tried to think some more importint things :D
[4:03:38] mavericks312: ppl talk about loyalty like they wouldnt do the same thing
[4:03:39] Molvonos: @Ranthyr_ Unless you're a psychatrist
[4:03:44] falldrgn: shes got bills to pay.. its that or only fans  (kidding)
[4:03:55] invisibleboomer: Towelliee what do you think about some guy that clicked not using macros but made it in time yet the UI either lagged or did wrong on blizzard part and wiped the whole party
[4:04:02] azzurrin: It's just Business
[4:04:05] Fugazi811: @Fugazi811 ?
[4:04:07] Sollice: The problem is a lot of people still look at WoW as a game. Which it is...Unless your making money off it then its a job
[4:04:07] Ranthyr_: @Molvonos tru tru
[4:04:10] azzurrin: I don't think people get that.
[4:04:30] azzurrin: I'd cast for North Korea if they paid me millions

[4:04:35] Molvonos: @Towelliee Details Name Redemption - Les has an idea for you.
[4:04:36] idenkaz_: i mean sure we can say that but im sure the atmosphere at Echo is much much better for casters. that played a role you cant convince me other wise.
[4:04:36] XugieXugo: Money talks, bottom line!
[4:04:40] oxie73: yep it happens all the time in everything, now in college now.
[4:04:45] falldrgn: Thats why you see raiders swap orgs.. IE Lorgok to Method. its all money
[4:04:53] fetza108: thats true she has to survive and she needs money. she couldnt do this just for fun
[4:04:55] mavericks312: i think the only caster signed to a certain team is eiya and kalamazi
[4:05:01] Silverwards: my consipracy theory on Naguura is she wanted to cast for Echo this tier :) the reasons don't matter to us lol
[4:05:03] populuxxe: More money and you're traveling from Italy to Sweden vs Italy to LA?
[4:05:14] akia03: would love to see kalamazi cast in the eu he'll be so confussed there
[4:05:15] MortalLesuj: @Molvonos donowalled
[4:05:20] Molvonos: lolol
[4:05:23] 91Niki: Can't miss out on those FF fan fests :p
[4:05:29] Sollice: @populuxxe Travel wont matter honestly. Echo or Liquid pays for all of that
[4:05:36] Thralazaar: man who wouldn't
[4:05:44] Thralazaar: it's their job after all
[4:05:50] shabobado: I know at least in dratnos’ case, casting with echo affords him to raid with his guild still and not compromise his schedule as much
[4:05:51] Wulfgrym: FF doesn't have fans, they have cultists
[4:05:55] Ranthyr_: If not the A. your finacially set already or B. you dont like money
[4:06:02] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee I got tired of hearing preach and alex.  they just sound like a bunch of pompous asses.  :D
[4:06:07] populuxxe: @Sollice Umm.. If I said "Would you rather fly from Italy to Sweden or Italy to LA?" you're telling me you wouldn't have a preference? LOL.
[4:06:14] flexgaming82: If I could get played to play video games I'd be in heaven
[4:06:19] wildragehs44: money is important but its not everything
[4:06:30] 91Niki: @populuxxe Not if you get paid more to fly to LA LUL
[4:06:32] MortalLesuj: scammazed
[4:06:32] ambiotic: Who was that hunter that got all butt hurt and tried to flame max? hed prob leak that shit
[4:06:42] Sollice: @populuxxe If things were equal...sure. It's not lol. She got paid more to cast for Echo. Travel goes out of the window then because its all taken care of
[4:06:48] populuxxe: @91Niki Reread my sentence I guess.
[4:06:59] Molvonos: hahaha
[4:07:13] Arocian: lol
[4:07:18] populuxxe: @Sollice I think you're focused on cost of travel not the traveling itself.
[4:07:18] Strifelol: Aww poor Nick
[4:07:25] snake_like: nick didn't wipe the raid :tf:
[4:07:26] Sollice: THERE IS NO COST FOR HER
[4:07:32] 91Niki: but not really LUL
[4:07:34] pbnj_kills: if the colors matched
[4:07:37] ParfumAmerican: what?! he did not bind the seed button?
[4:07:38] scramperlive: nah nah nah, cant have a good one
[4:07:39] populuxxe: @Sollice I NEVER SAID THERE WAS
[4:07:39] bubbles1489: thats neat
[4:07:42] idenkaz_: its, something KEKW
[4:07:42] fetza108: POGGERS
[4:07:44] Sollice: 10k or travel to Sweden. Tell me what you want
[4:07:50] 91Niki: @zyzary Something is a good word for it
[4:07:56] sartara: What are you planning to play in the seasons of Discovery?
[4:07:56] Sollice: Which would you prefer
[4:08:07] populuxxe: I think you are confused AF lol.
[4:08:17] falldrgn: im curiosu on how much the raiders make. its gotta be bank
[4:08:22] Sollice: @populuxxe Yes I am confused because you can't answer the question.
[4:08:44] Rudric_Ice: thr get paid in wow tokens
[4:08:49] Silverwards: imagine getting mad over why someone you don't know chose one work gig over another. Y'all need to chill :D
[4:09:24] populuxxe: @Sollice Let me restate my exact sentence for you. "You getting paid more money AND you only gotta travel from Italy to Sweden, as opposed to traveling from Italy to LA."
[4:09:28] j_bar111: @Towelliee what kind of giga nerfs you think we will see for mythic fyrakk?
[4:10:01] 91Niki: @populuxxe Right, then you go where the most money is. Then it no longer has anything to do with traveling lol
[4:10:04] Snabido: @j_bar111 Adding a lot of fire extinguishers coz hot damn what a fight
[4:10:29] mavericks312: has instant dollars killed tindral yet lol
[4:10:32] j_bar111: Think it will be HP or mechanic nerfs?
[4:10:44] j_bar111: @j_bar111 TRUE

[4:11:50] ambiotic: just need to slow down the mechanics a bit and its prob g2g

[4:15:02] Rudric_Ice: aint no way u guys killing tindral

[4:17:51] PoachedBananas: I was on Wegovy for a few weeks but it made me unbelievably sick
[4:18:08] Tripl3dot: the seed timings on tindrall are crazy
[4:18:19] Sollice: @PoachedBananas Ask your doctor for Ondasteron
[4:18:27] Sollice: Take that and ibuprophen when you take it

[4:23:19] marineboi1288: What server you playing on?
[4:23:22] Troniin: Doesn't SoD already belong to sanctum of domination? Season of discovery needs a different abbreviation

[4:30:41] adxx: this week stinks for Rise. Have timed 18-19's with Atal and WM no prob, but rise and fall cannot get a group to time with
[4:30:53] Murlocz: @mecabeast the murloc spam feels so nice lmao

[4:32:52] Mecabeast: I think cut-off is q4 start
[4:32:55] the_general01: i cant beat the heroic missions, but its stil fun, i wait for the arclight surges
[4:32:59] mavericks312: marvel snap wins mobile goty
[4:33:00] Murlocz: @towelliee You going to try to complete all heroic bosses with all families?
[4:33:45] Mewgun: ive never got into wow, should i do classic, retail or wait for sod?
[4:34:10] the_general01: @Mewgun both are good for different reasons, i can recommend both.
[4:35:15] Mewgun: @the_general01 retail looks alot more overwhelming lol
[4:35:25] dimofodi: i unlocked heroic and my teams are WEAK, going F2P feels rough
[4:35:45] CH4UNCY: @Towelliee Hey Rob, how you been? Looking forward to SoD? Been off WoW for too long but I can't miss this.
[4:35:56] Masqerader: ugh 4 hr downtime tomorrow
[4:36:04] the_general01: @Mewgun it can be, but once you get rolling its pretty easy to figure out. just dive in, do some quests, its pretty linear these days. classic is a bit tougher in that respect
[4:36:40] jones1608: jones1608 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:36:47] Mecabeast: I think the way to go as f2p is work on maxing one leader at a time
[4:36:48] Mewgun: @the_general01 thanks for the info
[4:36:55] ambiotic: wish they waited a few more weeks cause season 3 is so good
[4:37:07] the_general01: @Mewgun anytime fren
[4:37:10] invisibleboomer: the key to  warcraft rumble seems to be save arc light gold and upgrade leaders as free to play for stars

[4:54:08] mavericks312: aug evokers are having a blast right now
[4:54:16] pryse__: going for title is not fun, unless you have a preset group
[4:54:31] Silverwards: augvokers are living their bets lives. I am so happy for them
[4:54:31] pryse__: Even then its still not fun
[4:54:32] drunkieduckie: min/max can be fun, as can FOMO, but I like playing,my warrior best, as I have for many years.  if I get bored, I swap specs and have fun again (or maybe play an alt)
[4:54:39] j_bar111: reload ui
[4:54:50] zantos2020: @Masqerader 433 from heroics and raid finder

[4:55:53] j_hooligan: it will prob be council nymue and tendril
[4:56:15] akia03: smolderon an t swift next week prob after
[4:56:15] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:56:36] Daffen_Prime: smold is in 1st wing
[4:56:51] akia03: ah ya wierd order
[4:56:53] j_bar111: council and nymue 󠀀
[4:56:54] Niceloaf: council too
[4:56:55] Daffen_Prime: its pip and nyume only
[4:56:56] cyrex172: ive been having a blast with dragonriding....dragonflight is such an amazing expansion. yes im very late to the party
[4:56:57] honkblarg: council and nymue
[4:56:59] Bowwjack: @Towelliee Council and Nymue is next week
[4:57:00] j_bar111: then it will be tswift and fyrakk
[4:57:01] j_hooligan: con ny and tswift
[4:57:02] mavericks312: nymue,council, and t-swift
[4:57:06] Thralazaar: yeah it is fun for them to min max and meta ride but it just sucks how much it negatively influences the pug community (specifically in keys)
[4:57:16] Daffen_Prime: t-swif is last wing
[4:57:28] j_hooligan: last boss has been its own wing this expac
[4:57:30] Scarhearth: council and nymue likely
[4:57:53] slicc_vicc: @towelliee hey just started my tabling journey for the first time went guardian Druid any tips for beginning tanks for m+
[4:57:55] Daffen_Prime: t-swif and fyalk is last wing
[4:58:18] maane97: yep
[4:58:19] mavericks312: 100%
[4:58:20] Cashx: Big facts
[4:58:21] Thralazaar: it's actually near impossible for me to get into a 15 or above as an overqualified WW (463 ilvl, 2.3k score now and 2.6 last season) i can't do m+ without my own key anymore
[4:58:23] cyrex172: yeah 100 %. u dont want to waste your keys
[4:58:26] Molvonos: I just did a 17 DHT with a feral druid in it.  Was kind of amazed.
[4:58:28] cyrex172: thats just wasting precious time
[4:58:31] Nerendis: Oh I'm toxic as fuck with my own key
[4:58:33] Molvonos: First one i've seen all season in M+
[4:59:06] raldrik: I think they need to do a thing where a returning player can get their own key without having to do one. I cannot even get a +0 going to break back into keys.
[4:59:06] Velarn435: As a tank as long as I have Lust and no one from Ragnaros I'm fine.
[4:59:07] Se7enthSinn: how do you fix that?
[4:59:09] cyrex172: Im going to work hard at learning and b ecomming good at the game so that im worthy and can actually hold my own in a high key raid
[4:59:13] cyrex172: itll be awhile
[4:59:18] zantos2020: My M+ rating is 0 right now lol, I'm afraid of sucking and the toxic responses

[4:59:26] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee D:
[4:59:30] superpudd: I took a Ret to my 20 Fall, smashed it still
[4:59:32] Niksen_99: Just inv 3 BM hunters EZ
[4:59:37] akia03: surv is kinda op in m+ :)
[4:59:38] Thralazaar: i legitimately pick the most qualified not the meta pick
[4:59:47] N7Spectr3: I wish they would fix brewmaster, I really miss tanking as brewmaster.
[4:59:48] Thralazaar: and the keys go better because of it when the key actually picks up
[4:59:51] poubellegames: You're also way more likely to see meta classes applying. A lot of times I don't even see off meta classes in my list of applicants
[5:00:01] goldvapors09: ret bm outlaw
[5:00:04] mrjinkzyz: i only Pull  300k in ret
[5:00:07] Mecabeast: Non-meta dps have to pay start your own group tax
[5:00:08] ThePawPaw: they NEVER know if you are survival unless they invate you alrdy but they never mind when i join.....and see me pumping KEKW
[5:00:08] j_bar111: Do they pull through walls?
[5:00:09] OhNoNotAgain: Just have a ret that knows about the bug in WM
[5:00:10] cyrex172: LOl
[5:00:10] Nerendis: "I took an S+ dps to my key - I was shocked we smashed it" ??
[5:00:13] Thralazaar: @mavericks312 yeah i don't disagree, but it doesn't mean i should be okay with it
[5:00:14] cyrex172: LEROY JENKINS
[5:00:15] Daffen_Prime: i play both evoker specs but i aint getting inv when im doing Dev
[5:00:31] treeshark: Your also more likely to see the meta classes more because everyone chooses those specs/classes in my experience
[5:00:34] theberserkviking: hey im a ret an i can say i have never pulled every thing while running that dungeon lol
[5:00:36] Lorzoran: Yeah. being a ret pala myself, judgement and wake of ashes pulls africa. So tilting
[5:00:39] pryse__: I still kinda play shadow priest :)

[5:01:10] Spoonzzy: Ret is so annoying in there
[5:01:13] 3dRes: Magic walls LUL
[5:01:19] j_hooligan: my homie is a sur hunter and he pumps but always gets kicked for not being BM
[5:01:23] Scarhearth: Spriest is pretty crap now. Survival and marksman suck compared to BM
[5:01:29] Silverwards: take a BDK tank and it's fine
[5:01:32] Spoonzzy: They literally pull everything lol
[5:01:34] the_general01: its not just ret i guess. i dropped a d&d in there and got the same mobs
[5:01:43] Lorzoran: also near the sisters. ret palas pull upstairs
[5:01:51] akia03: @ThePawPaw ya same here with like only 1400 others
[5:01:53] notdxsty: uncap shadow crash
[5:02:04] Nerendis: The walls aren't walls for some reason in that dungeon

[5:20:45] treyjd15: big agree
[5:20:46] MysticRaven_: depend how much hes having to vivify
[5:21:08] Nokterian: MW has a new mana tea that should solve some of the mana issues but they run out of mana if they have to do ranged

[5:21:34] Mostdangspy: @Towelliee do we get another catalyst after reset?
[5:21:48] geokouts: wait! it is NOT a Hunter weapon too???
[5:21:54] j_bar111: @Mostdangspy yes should be another charge after reset

[5:22:52] j_bar111: I would sure hope so
[5:22:54] Complete_Phased: you should
[5:22:55] magemaster225: dont think you ened to spec ret
[5:22:56] Samaellus: guess yes??
[5:23:01] maccaruso: I don't see why you wouldn't
[5:23:01] AnimalCrackers_19: I don't see why not
[5:23:02] homewrecker101: yes
[5:23:03] 3663Sharad: you should yeah
[5:23:03] mythic_tavern: Doesn't the Lego only drop on Mythic?
[5:23:06] the_general01: thats the same question i have as a blood dk
[5:23:08] Atolanos: probably not because its strength
[5:23:18] Arocian: yep
[5:23:19] Jattell: what i want to know, does that axe give int as a holy pala, just asking :p
[5:23:23] Atolanos: oh you said poally
[5:23:29] Shuttlelol: yep, im gonna be switching from holy to ret for fryakk everytime lol
[5:23:35] Bowwjack: @Towelliee yeah it would be more for heroic last boss than anything
[5:23:36] XugieXugo: Doesnt it have bad luck protection?
[5:23:37] PvtHudson093: still get bad luck protection
[5:23:41] MeisterPetze: i just want it for the collection. who cares about itemlevel
[5:23:53] biirrd: if its the same as evoker lego, you only have one chance per week to get it.. so do the highest you can
[5:23:57] Atolanos: Is it personal loot ?
[5:23:58] maccaruso: LFR can get it? This seems like some teasing the peasants bullshit.
[5:24:05] beerking2323: think that is why they added the staff in Nyume for ranged classes to try and equal the playing table compared to the 2H axe
[5:24:43] doogs44: The axe wont drop for everyone else until after reset this week right?
[5:24:44] j_bar111: I think only Heroic and higher had bad luck protection for the evoker one
[5:24:55] mythic_tavern: Yazma sux on tyrannical
[5:24:59] Bowwjack: @Towelliee i wonder if there will be people buying CE just to get it.
[5:25:05] ohnot___her: @doogs44 Correct
[5:25:05] Velarn435: Wonder if the legndary axe can be bought with Dinars next season.
[5:25:14] marineboi1288: I think blizzard said there is bad luck protection
[5:25:34] the_general01: @Bowwjack buying cutting edge just to get it will be in the tens of millions because those guilds will still need it more than likely
[5:26:45] NicStone8: the on use ability of that lego axe is insane!
[5:26:51] Shuttlelol: @Bowwjack isnt the axe personal loot
[5:27:02] Bowwjack: @the_general01 yeah buying ce would be like gold cap on 13 characters and a guild probably lol, but yes it would probably still happen. and if it's personal loot after this week then yeah there we go. but Most of the guilds probably won't start selling until about a month or 2 into the raid.
