[2:00:28] Wrizzik: so it's more than just hte keynote? Wasn't the keynote always streamed free?
[2:00:34] ashwing_: were they 800 Dollars previously though
[2:00:38] FlameStryke: it could also be that once they killed it during covid, people just can't be bothered now because of the shit bliz pulled like layoffs with bringing metzen back and such
[2:00:49] mavericks312: also some ppl can now save thousands by not traveling
[2:00:56] Amazanmartyn: you going?

[2:01:51] Sollice: More than it ever has been
[2:02:03] FlameStryke: ya thats the ultimate thing for me to go to bliz con its crossing thw whole country from TO to cali, then paying like 1k for a hotel for a couple days, the flight will be like 1500 - 2k for me to go and its just not worth it now
[2:02:24] QMGSaint: I'm stuck in bum ass Florida.
[2:03:05] Sollice: @qmgsaint sucks to be you. I got out!
[2:03:08] Stixxerz: confirmed @Towelliee works lowkey for blizzard
[2:03:20] FlameStryke: ya i normally do book it right after blizcon, but man the desire is not there this time
[2:03:21] GamingInstinctsTV: I am from Florida, booked tickets 3 days ago, they were cheap. Hotel is what sucks.
[2:03:28] AnimalCrackers_19: what if they cancel again
[2:03:58] QMGSaint: @Sollice I wish, wifey job is based here. If it wasn't for that, i def be in Cali right now
[2:04:06] RafaCM_94: is it always in the US?
[2:04:21] Wrizzik: and if you find out late, you can always move the hotel stay dates further away, then call back and cancel
[2:04:29] Eviltuna13: no blizzcon next year its a Covid 2.0 year crreamClown
[2:04:33] theDirtyon3: that name KEKW

[2:04:48] theDirtyon3: Vahgina KEKW
[2:05:12] FlameStryke: ya i would love to see bliz do one in canada, i know a lot of people would come from all over the world to canada as its much easier to get to then the south US for most people, it would be epic
[2:05:26] FlameStryke: plus its much cheaper than the US
[2:05:36] Wrizzik: @GamingInstinctsTV I don't know how you guys deal with the humidity. And CA has way too high COL
[2:05:51] theDirtyon3: Laughs in Texas humidity

[2:07:33] abracka_: nobody logs into my guild, game is dead
[2:07:36] xziyn: That Chinese guy did leak it would be an Elemental expansion
[2:07:39] GamingInstinctsTV: Yes because the mount is called Algarian Stormrider. Stormrider is pretty elemental to me.
[2:07:53] QMGSaint: I've been dying to see the void just take over all of azeroth.
[2:07:53] FlameStryke: ugh cata classic lol
[2:07:59] luckfore: testing the waters 1 month before announcement lol
[2:08:03] michaszl89: hi

[2:09:34] mavericks312: @Sicknessqt idk why ppl thought there was gonna be a revamp what in the story told y ou there would be
[2:09:57] theDirtyon3: New side of azeroth is better than a revamp
[2:10:02] velissaro: i'd laugh if the datamined stuff was just for 10.2.5
[2:10:04] mavericks312: im hype as hell for 11.0 just cause of where the story is going

[2:19:52] GamingInstinctsTV: 3 raids is enough
[2:19:57] ILikeKillTheZombies: @Syllvn ? Legion had a lot of content
[2:19:58] xziyn: I'd be surprised if we at least don't get a mini raid in 10.3, otherwise that'd be almost a year without a new raid, assuming 11.0 is fall 2024
[2:20:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: 3 big raids seems good
[2:20:07] FlameStryke: I don't think DF was better than legion, there is a lot i likke with the flying and such and no areas like in legion where you had to travel a mile to get to, but ya legion could have been much better if they had options for like quick jumps to bypass some of the hard to access areas but otherwise I loved legion
[2:20:11] reggiepowa: fyrakk just doesn't feel like the last boss of the expansion though
[2:20:21] zysmos: don't really care about the mini patches i would advocate for 4 raids
[2:20:24] Sathfire: yeah 3 major patches on top of Fated is more than enough
[2:20:28] GamingInstinctsTV: @xziyn it will most likely be fated raid, like how it was in Shadowlands.
[2:20:42] ThickCityBish: legion felt smoother to be honest
[2:20:45] mavericks312: sure for casuals DF maybe a top 2 xpac for me DF is easily 3 or 4
[2:20:48] Wrizzik: OMG the Legion class weapons/fights
[2:20:51] xziyn: Legion had much higher highs than DF, but much lower lows
[2:20:51] mox2g: its 2 casual aint nothing to do
[2:20:52] FlameStryke: ya I didn't like Gated shit either, and yes i agree with you there @Towelliee
[2:21:08] Syllvn: I'm a casual player tbf
[2:21:15] mox2g: BRING BACK THE GRIND
[2:21:15] ILikeKillTheZombies: For me mage tower in legion > df open world content
[2:21:16] xziyn: @GamingInstinctsTV Yeah, but not enough, fated would be fine for 6-8 weeks, not 6+ months
[2:21:17] Theduskflyer: you think we gonna get a grind back in 11.0?
[2:21:35] mavericks312: @mox2g right cause it was aimed at casual players to play a couple times a week while still being able to play other games
[2:21:44] Syllvn: Hardcore in sense I'm buried in here 24/7 but I don't play hardcore, more driven by mogs than ilvl xD
[2:21:56] mavericks312: @mox2g yea thats just not where the climate of the playerbase is
[2:22:00] dv_domino: wooooooooooo, a gnome died
[2:22:15] Contendedlemon: would love to see you do more Mythic+ content like pushing for higher io
[2:22:25] GamingInstinctsTV: @xziyn still calling it that 11.0 is Elemental expansion. 12.0 is prolly faction war and 13 is void lord
[2:22:52] Broomba: july 2019
[2:22:55] byrdeen45: Hmm cant buy the dlc for new world
[2:23:05] Yagr6: elemental theme xpansion for 11.0 would be nice

[2:23:23] Ponas91: faction war is dead. alliance and horde are bffs now
[2:23:25] TheRiwen: sell it
[2:23:26] Brodih_: need that mount gold, sell it
[2:23:26] xziyn: @GamingInstinctsTV That's what the Chinese leaks says yeah
[2:23:26] Oryihn: that ring is $$$$$
[2:23:27] FlameStryke: i would sell it if you don't plan to tank
[2:23:35] Effin_Steffin: sell it since you're gonna outlevel it anyway
[2:23:41] FlameStryke: then keep iot
[2:23:49] mavericks312: yea that naruu guy is old news im pretty sure
[2:23:49] FlameStryke: ya thats true
[2:23:58] FlameStryke: sell it because you will outlevel it soon
[2:24:00] Sathfire: use it!
[2:24:04] theviperleet: go check the price of it on an alt  @Towelliee
[2:24:19] mavericks312: they could be prepatch thing
[2:24:26] FlameStryke: Ya if it sells for 100G i would sell it
[2:24:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was just thinking prepatch
[2:24:41] GamingInstinctsTV: @xziyn that Chinese guy got every expansions correct. The real question is what happens after the void? 14.0 makes me think it's the end of current wow and we get everything remade for WoW 2 or something of that's sorts. Void lords are the ultimate bad.
[2:24:47] FlameStryke: gold is king there in HC
[2:24:50] ILikeKillTheZombies: maybe it's for anniversary to get the anniversary mount
[2:25:18] Noshpan: Well, I just used the last of my Tiger's Blood. All that's left is the Boomer Blast.
[2:25:35] GamingInstinctsTV: I looked at that link, it's a big nothing burger, looks like just mobs/bosses for the public surge events.
[2:25:39] FlameStryke: you would be suprised and it depends on the drop rates
[2:25:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10g or 20g sounds good, that's money for mounts
[2:25:48] FlameStryke: if its 50G then i would keep it

[2:26:34] riskybiznes: boomer blast is so good~!
[2:27:09] FlameStryke: omg also watching zack and he is looking at the AOC latest video, is it me or does that game still feel clunky af ><
[2:27:13] mavericks312: players loved the fated season
[2:27:21] Yagr6: fated raids more than likely after 10.2
[2:27:39] ILikeKillTheZombies: they also have trading post now for new monthly cosmetics
[2:27:45] EKS90_: @FlameStryke its still in heavy development and not even a beta. ofc it will be clunky
[2:27:58] reggiepowa: it would be in like may and last until november?
[2:28:06] xziyn: Could still have 10.3 in april/may and 11.0 in like october/mov
[2:28:15] FlameStryke: I know i have a founders pack @eks90_ but 3 years into it you think they would smooth it out
[2:28:36] Sollice: Ugh I didn't realize you cant even buy Angry Earth yet
[2:28:46] Sollice: Your going to have to buy the day of? That shit never works out great
[2:28:53] EKS90_: @FlameStryke i dont think so,  3 year devtime for a massive mmo is still short imo
[2:28:57] xziyn: 10.2.5 early Jan, 10.2.7 march, 10.3 early may, would be more than fine, time-wise
[2:29:19] Nokterian: i think 10.2.5 will come and be just like how SL went
[2:29:21] PigPenLen: @Sollice yeah day of is what i saw last night as well smh
[2:29:23] DyeAgonal: is 10.2.5 going to be Season 2 for pvp?
[2:29:49] Sollice: Hope it doesnt cause any issues
[2:29:52] cabalish: beta in may yeah
[2:29:59] Spinecloud: For an adult in my 30s, CE raiding, 3 raid tiers feels plenty enough for me lol
[2:30:15] Spinecloud: Excluding fated is a fun bonus
[2:30:31] xziyn: Wait, 10.2.7 would be in March, not May @Towelliee ?
[2:30:34] mavericks312: fated season 100%
[2:30:40] GamingInstinctsTV: Fated 100%
[2:30:42] reggiepowa: 3 months I think
[2:31:15] Artiiz: @xziyn He means it'll end in may
[2:31:15] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:31:19] mavericks312: cause if you do a another raid you take players away from testing alpha and beta
[2:31:54] xziyn: @Artiiz Right, so a 10.3 at the end of May with an expansion early november would be more than fine time-wise

[2:32:41] Nokterian: I just tested Cyberpunk 2077 on my new 4080 with the new DLSS 3.5 and ray tracing it looks amazing just mind blowing
[2:33:02] mavericks312: @xziyn wrong a season usually lasts like 5 or 6 months alone
[2:33:33] mavericks312: everyone loved the fated season now everyone doesnt wanna believe it can happen again
[2:33:39] Sollice: If anyone wants in Hammer Squad on Maramma I am online now message Sollise
[2:33:50] mavericks312: i blame max for getting ppls hopes up lol
[2:33:51] luckfore: wow: heroes of the storm
[2:34:04] Artiiz: I don't know why people want there to be another raid tier, aren't people usually quite tired of DF by now?
[2:34:08] KrimsonElite: mornin
[2:34:13] reggiepowa: I mean new raid is definitely better than fated season but fated season is better than nothing
[2:34:14] Artiiz: Or will be at least
[2:34:15] xziyn: @mavericks312 I think a full-on raid is unlikely, but no raids at all would seem worse, like one year without a new raid at all seems rough
[2:34:21] Sicknessqt: What did max even say?
[2:34:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like the idea of a one boss raid (Chromatus)
[2:34:51] reaperblade93: I’m really curious what is the next expansion? Elemental stuff? Scarlet crusade? Void and light?
[2:34:56] Sollice: That's what I said. 2 boss mini raid with something void to introduce it
[2:35:01] mavericks312: uldir?
[2:35:21] xziyn: Might finally fdinish the gnoll storyline
[2:35:26] Gungre: Wasn't that crucible?

[2:36:20] FlameStryke: also phasing at the same time
[2:36:45] cabalish: Crucible of Storms
[2:36:55] Cictani: Everything for the upper 0.1%
[2:37:07] mavericks312: @xziyn i mean ppl loved it when shadowlands did it
[2:37:11] Oryihn: MOP was great to me.. I loved the huge amount of conent
[2:37:11] xziyn: MoP was still a lot better than Cata mate lol

[2:37:42] lordwolf2004: lordwolf2004 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 102 months! 
[2:38:34] xziyn: @mavericks312 Because it was only 3 months and people wanted to back to CN, but SoFo still came out only a few months earlier. Here you'd have no new raids for a year
[2:38:38] Brodih_: lol yes
[2:38:44] mavericks312: yea even thought legion and mop are both in my top 3 neither was very casual friendly
[2:38:49] FlameStryke: you picked up a disease there too
[2:38:58] bekindtoeachothr: I think wows problem has been how gear works. Its an old model of progression. Seems like there is a more modern way to keep all the content relevant to everyone
[2:38:59] ILikeKillTheZombies: blizzard should release one big raid with 30 bosses
[2:39:01] FlameStryke: those suck
[2:39:12] FlameStryke: get some purification pots
[2:39:32] Anacydae: @bekindtoeachothr syncing?
[2:39:41] FlameStryke: complete redesign of BRD/LBRS/UBRS/BWL as 1 big raid LOL
[2:39:50] FlameStryke: like it shouuld have been originally
[2:40:05] mavericks312: there is still gonna be a 10.3 plus a 3.5 and 3.7 with content

[2:40:38] FlameStryke: oh shit the rest didn't pull lucky
[2:40:40] reggiepowa: @mavericks312 think we just discussed how 10.3 won't happen, only a fated season
[2:41:14] xziyn: My bet is mini-raid+fated season in 10.3

[2:42:03] mavericks312: @reggiepowa thats still 10.3 what are you talking about
[2:42:21] DrSoosh: Calculated
[2:42:37] bekindtoeachothr: For me what kept the game more engaging at that time was the guild. LIke working on guild levels and I thhink ithe wow community was just more fun then
[2:42:38] reggiepowa: @mavericks312 no it's not, don't confuse people. major patches mean a raid tier. fated season will be like 10.2.7 like in SL
[2:42:52] Aro725: too long
[2:43:00] xziyn: March or smth
[2:43:01] zysmos: like 8 months
[2:43:31] Noshpan: That really isn't that long ago

[2:44:51] Sicknessqt: Legion came after HFC so its all good
[2:45:54] theviperleet: @Towelliee didnt they aquire 150 ppl a few months ago?
[2:45:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Raids are a ton of work, no doubt
[2:46:03] xziyn: For a full fledged 10.3, 10.2.5 and 10.2.7 would have to be only 6 weeks, which whil possible, seems unlikely

[2:54:35] OrangeAsp: From what I understand, they didn't pay them enough for living nearby to be a realistic option.  So it was remote or not at all for money reasons
[2:54:36] mavis316: what mouse?  i'm sorry i was half ass paying attention

[3:01:20] Sollice: Open back does have a "wider" soundstage because it lets in air and its a more filling sound
[3:01:42] Sollice: Closed back headphones will give you more bass, but its usally at the cost of mid and high clarity
[3:02:10] Sollice: and yea most decent motherboards have decent soundcards so you can adjust full eq or if you have a DAC you can adjust treble and bass on there also
[3:02:20] alamonav: open back squad
[3:02:21] mavericks312: open back is cool but i like feeling immersed in the game for some reason
[3:03:01] alamonav: im paranoid af with sound canceling headsets etc
[3:03:11] Sollice: @mavericks312 I like the open back because Katie and I game in the same room and I can hear her now and I can pay attention to the dogs and cat
[3:03:12] Archangelicx: Archangelicx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months!

[3:04:32] Sarocus: Couple of years ago, there was a fire in my building and my headphones filtered out the alarm
[3:04:52] Sollice: Yeah I would never wear sound cancelling headphones unless its a gym or plane to be honest
[3:04:57] Bonussize: Wealthy house have guns and security systems
[3:04:59] Sollice: or when I had a yard to mow
[3:05:09] AlphasaurusRexx: @mavericks312 mine went from player zero video games to beating Elden Ring. she got addicted to it.

[3:07:38] AlphasaurusRexx: @mavericks312 yeah i cant get her to play anything else lol. she wants to try the new Zelda but if she cant run around and do nothing for hours she isnt interested

[3:09:23] Sollice: This is Joes last week for starter chance and if Dak does shit I am dropping him for sure
[3:09:29] UtherBrexton: i think if you just run along the shore of the channels down the road they will aggro to you
[3:10:06] TheItalianStallion321: isnt Burrow hurt?

[3:17:33] mavericks312: @Sollice would take a shot in the dark on fields over jones lol
[3:18:10] Poriand: I bet they add a battle pass to rumble at some point
[3:18:25] Sollice: Yeah I think Mac Jones is on borrowed time to be honest. He is going to do something to get a suspension

[3:44:28] Sollice: I may go back to GS and Blunderbuss
[3:44:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Musket is not that good in PvE
[3:45:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blunderbuss is pretty strong. They nerfed greatsword a bit but it's still viable
[3:45:15] con_einstein: whys everyone talking about new world again?
[3:45:21] DunzoCD: musket isnt gonna be hitscan anymor either
[3:45:23] Sollice: I have NEVER played ice or void guantlet
[3:45:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hammer is a bit more about CC than it is damage but it still hits hard. Sword and shield is still a lot of damage
[3:45:41] Sollice: @DunzoCD So is that better or worse for PVE I dunno lol
[3:45:41] redcapcombo: Hey Towelliee! Its been a long time I hope you are doing well.
[3:46:03] redcapcombo: @Sollice it doesnt really matter for pve
[3:46:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still run greatsword and hammer a lot, but bleed rapier does way more damage
[3:46:26] DunzoCD: @DunzoCD still not good in PvE lol, the melee weapons can just hit more mobs. but it makes it worse for PvP for the aimbotters
[3:47:02] Sollice: Yeah musket and bow since you have to aim and try to get headshots are hard, for at least for me, because such close quarters in dungeons
[3:47:03] abracka_: super hype to get it next week
[3:47:14] abracka_: gonna be refreshing the shipping page every 5 minutes KEKW
