[2:14:50] Bulletpunchs: does cross faction raiding open today?
[2:14:54] EarlofCockwood: @Critcobain who cares leveling? its 1% of the game. arcane is not just 1 button. maybe in classic it was

[2:25:13] archbishup: Battlefield seems like it took the path a lot of games did.  The publisher let marketing take the lead and tell the developers what they thing gamers want, destroying the identity of the game they were making and trashing their own base.  Battlefield was not meant to be Call of Dutys direct "flavor" competitor, they were different types of military shooters.  Nor was it Fortnite

[2:27:13] 91Niki: Slinky health bar
[2:27:13] Trixstah187: seagull is the real end game boss
[2:27:38] archbishup: @91Niki In the same boat.  WoW will only use about 40% load on my graphics card while cycling 100% load across 4 threads of the 24 it has available on CPU.
[2:27:41] Skkold: @archbishup the thing is, what people want is usually what the publisher tells them. They don't create feedback out of nothing, they get feedback from players.
[2:28:10] 91Niki: @archbishup We're talking about Battlefield 2042.
[2:28:11] Squirrel_nutty: seagulls mmmm stop it now

[2:29:02] faulen: Gambit Sanguine is gonna be fun
[2:29:36] 91Niki: @Trippitich72 Who are we talking about ?
[2:30:04] archbishup: @Skkold Yeah but if you hope to get more players by taking from CoD, so you listen to input from CoD players about why they play that instead of BF, while ignoring BF.  You are saying to you BF players, we don't want you anyway, while hoping to out CoD CoD enough to flip their entire base.  Its a shortsighted growth model and destroys your own brands base of why they play it and what made BF BF.

[2:41:31] 91Niki: @stallowned Yes
[2:41:32] CptTeempo: Fyi the 3 pm Pdt Lost Ark twitch drop is today Towelliee
[2:41:37] FranciscoTheMage: on what planet would it make sense revenue wise to make a sub free with amazon prime
[2:41:41] chrslp: LUL
[2:41:47] Korupcija_: how long does it say maintenance is
[2:41:49] CptTeempo: cohhPog
[2:41:53] 91Niki: @stallowned Idk if you saw the latest system, giving you transmog, mounts and pets
[2:41:58] stallowned: ah ok, i thought they removed it for some reason

[2:42:18] 91Niki: They removed it for a bit t o revamp it @stallowned
[2:42:27] OGk3rm1t: @FranciscoTheMage When you are a company as large as amazon its small change compared to the tax breaks and ad revenue that is associated with it.
[2:42:30] stallowned: ahh nice
[2:42:31] Niksen_99: Did you have a good time in vegas? Nice food ?

[2:42:43] FranciscoTheMage: maybe im confused.
[2:42:50] fistofnature: blight bags dont
[2:43:01] baron_savage: Blight bags don't bolster, but they can be bolstered by other mobs.
[2:43:03] FranciscoTheMage: @k3rm1t_d_fr4g what is @Towelliee talking about
[2:44:01] Davcus09: i haven't played since Legion is there a lot of change since then to the game?
[2:44:19] The_Metal_Man: do your rogue a favour and grab the blight bags too :)
[2:45:03] Coriollis: bolstered, sanguine, necrotic monkaS remember the horror
[2:45:03] lumaday: legion timewalking is this week?? nice
[2:45:05] flebbooo: Same
[2:45:11] CritcobainTV: facts
[2:45:15] QuigsTV: Same id assume
[2:45:32] OGk3rm1t: @FranciscoTheMage Not sure, but I understand the business model from Amazon's stand point. The prime sub guarentee's that ppl will watch a streamer because they are commited to it at a certain level. It allows for ad time to be sold to third parties whihch in turn makes that money plus back so Amazon doesnt really see a loss.
[2:46:01] swordart2022: Should have always up legion dungeons
[2:46:17] lumaday: Do you have it macro'd ?
[2:46:21] lumaday: in other abilities?
[2:46:27] handlebarswow: do you have a /use 13 or 14 macro? it will drop if you use it while targeting an enemy

[2:46:54] astreinoid: dont have it in a macro as other on use with another spell.
[2:47:03] FranciscoTheMage: i thought i heard him say tying prime sub to wow sub or something. i was half playing my game and half listening
[2:47:10] FranciscoTheMage: i must have misunderstood
[2:47:34] vulkankragon: have you guys noticed how ff14 hype has completely vanished?
[2:47:50] nodramajustpizzass: how much longer till reset ?
[2:48:09] swordart2022: 37 minutes says in game
[2:48:16] nodramajustpizzass: ty @fairplay2021
[2:48:35] FranciscoTheMage: FF14 is like the worst... its not surprising
[2:48:48] OGk3rm1t: Not sure, i'd be interested to see how that works between Microsoft and Amazon tho. The IP cantracts would be crazy and I'm not really sure what benefit WoW would gain from it. Unless it was a speculative gain from mincro transaction potential.

[2:53:39] OGk3rm1t: @Towelliee I can see it, but I think the back lash is not worth it. It would create animosity from ppl.
[2:53:40] shimwood: I'd cry if collectibles/mog where in prime loot
[2:53:47] szble: hope it happens for sure now

[2:56:33] OGk3rm1t: @mavericks312 It could be something as simple as making it "Prime Loot" that doesn't require viewership but does require that you are a  prime member. Which then would allow Amazon to make Prime "Tiers" for membership that have different values in the future if they wanted to.

[3:13:06] driscoll94: but at that time, it was a great set lookwise. everything else was so over the top/zandalari looking
[3:13:08] kroknows101: the warrior tier mog is just soo sooo bad. It's insulting
[3:13:18] BrotherBeezy: But since the team only had to focus on 4 mogs for that tier they were able to make them extra special ;)

[3:14:11] Grady2385: cant wait till they took the vault out of the game and gear only drop from instances
[3:14:42] devilhawk83: Probably my favourite set for looks was the Conquerers Deathbringer's set for Warlocks
[3:14:44] dracullus: BoD and Arathi warfront were best sets from BfA
[3:15:23] tsktsk: the creation catalyst can be used once per week per character or per account? I quickly skimmed through wowhead and didn't see anything.
[3:15:33] QuigsTV: @dracullus I agree
[3:15:39] swordart2022: @tsktsk per character

[3:19:32] tsktsk: I love the mount creation system in this patch.
[3:19:37] Tokies: same it drives me a little nuts that I don't know what any of it does. I wish they made it more plain

[3:20:45] Starryskys: @towelliee do you have a contract to use to help get a little more rep
[3:20:46] fistofnature: why would you spend almost 2 mill on a boe if you are not world first raiding? LUL
[3:20:48] fistofnature: waste of money
[3:21:09] Thusj: how long till vault?

[3:23:21] FranciscoTheMage: people need to go put some quarters in ms pac man if thats the kind of games they want to play

[3:24:15] daddyslugnasty: wheres the catalyst going to be located?

[3:24:34] Qargory: oh sick, so we can easily make all difficulty mogs, thats so good
[3:24:36] swordart2022: Transmog from it is big W
[3:24:39] mavericks312: makes sense
[3:24:47] Jeanssi: that's neat, if you get 262 m+ gear and convert it, you get normal and hc appearance very easily

[3:25:08] robertjordan83: @Towelliee whats teh point of putting non-tier in the catalyst?
[3:25:09] faulen: Here is the list:  Gear from Sepulcher of the First Ones, Gear from Mythic and Mythic+ Dungeon Obtained during Season 3, Cosmic Gladiator Gear, Gear Purchasable with Sandworn Relics, sold by Rafiq, Gear from the World Boss Antros

[3:28:29] swordart2022: KEKW
[3:28:32] aistahh: Seeing warrior being so low on dps for Sofo, feels like I wasted my time gearing & playing my warrior.
[3:28:36] Renzay83: or lihuvum

[3:29:40] Newlander: no need to increase. you can craft 4 piece in 4 weeks
[3:29:40] handlebarswow: you don't need a lot of people for statistically significant data
[3:29:41] Renzay83: well now that people can craft tier who cares about tier from vault :/
[3:29:48] mavericks312: with the catalyst now they dont have to increase

[5:05:51] naughtynurse123: Imagine how dog shit this game has been over the course of shadowlands and yet ppl are still hyped about 10.0 and upcoming shit . Wow is a corruption its like meth regardless of how bad it gets ppl wont leave it
[5:06:04] Demanisraar: oh it wil probably
[5:06:09] michaelmm: They said there would be a gearing bump in S4
[5:06:23] TheCliffyShow: Didn't they say Season 4 gear would be higher iten level>
[5:06:28] Eregbueye: He has an OP neck
[5:06:31] AlphasaurusRexx: @naughtynurse123 just because you dont like WoW anymore does not mean many others feel the same way
[5:06:55] Motraxtv: There is no other game thats good  thats why people will not leave wow :D
[5:06:56] MILESkg21: what is dead may never die
[5:06:58] temp3st98: i left in june now im back :)

[5:07:25] michaelmm: Hopefully they give as a time for next tuesday's annoucement soon!
[5:07:26] CritcobainTV: doing lfr on my pally real quick to try to get a 3rd tier piece before i do the catalyst LUL
[5:07:33] naughtynurse123: @alphasaurusrexx no i mean its shit there is no doubt about that maybe some day 3 player likes it but every elder knows how bad the game is and yet they wont let go thats my point
[5:07:35] Everbliss: its the sunk-cost fallacy. people have spent so much time in WoW collecting shit, they cant leave
[5:07:35] MILESkg21: Demanisraar good KEKW
[5:08:06] TheCliffyShow: I prefer Mr. Sweepy
[5:08:12] Demanisraar: @MilesKG21 LUL

[5:08:27] Zantex0: I agree, it is still the most put together game
[5:08:35] Gurtogg: graphics have gotten better every expac
[5:08:42] handlebarswow: smooth gameplay of WoW is still UNMATCHED
[5:08:44] MILESkg21: just a time taker til Ashes comes out
[5:08:50] swordart2022: Doomers in chat again Sadge
[5:08:53] michaelmm: There isn't much like Wow raiding wise. hell even the open world is still better realized than most of the competition!
[5:09:01] fistofnature: its all buzzwords LUL
[5:09:04] Demanisraar: Been playing since '09.. had some breaks in bad expacs... but yeah always come back
[5:09:17] therodd: Personally, nothing tops the gameplay, especially the group content. The story presentation shit is awful though and I hope they do something with that in the new expansion.
[5:09:17] flebbooo: WoW feels so familair and its combat still is just really fluent imo
[5:09:18] Qargory: my parents have played since day 1 and still play today, took a break here n there but theyre still pushing keys today
[5:09:19] Bernardo994: i just cant wait until the nest expansion so we can move on

[5:10:05] j_bar111: So what did we find you needed to open the catalyst?
[5:10:09] Demanisraar: FF14 seems ton of fun, IF you have the right community
[5:10:11] Reckless_Monk: after 4 years of EQ.. I switched to WoW and ive been here for 17 years
[5:10:17] naughtynurse123: The problem with wow these days is that they are leading towards a direction that they never should have and the leading arrow of that disaster started with rwf
[5:10:32] naughtynurse123: There is no casual anymore either tryhard or wq gaming

[7:10:13] ijuki: @Shuttlelol It did
[7:10:21] Amarlian: MoP had an excellent cinematic with the reveal
[7:10:41] Shuttlelol: MOP is so foggy
[7:10:48] Gurtogg: Shadowlands alpha started 6 months after announcement
[7:10:50] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @amarlian but I live for the brain dead chat takes
[7:11:07] boopbopbamski: big yikes if we dont get one that would be very weird
[7:11:09] im_capy: Im kinda curious if the blizz team actively wants to move on from SL sooner rather than later Vs past expansions
[7:11:10] 91Niki: @Mr__AV Does it not say prismatic socket on the item?
[7:11:12] Zansteh: please have a CGI
[7:11:20] ijuki: No 9.3 ... we did instead get cinematic instead POGGERS

[7:11:49] StoicTaurus: Entire Saurafg arc was cinematic heavy
[7:11:49] im_capy: the BFA launch cinematic was insane
[7:11:53] Amarlian: if they were legit complaints, sure but it's just going to be crap and scrolling way to fast. @Heyhowsitgoingtonight . Plus half asking for beta access plz...
[7:12:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe not that last bfa cinematic Kappa
[7:12:47] 91Niki: @Mr__AV You also gotta make sure you match item and gem. You can't add new gems to old sockets from different exps

[7:34:01] 91Niki: People are special, what can I say
[7:34:04] lovemymage: it's not average gamer. it's reddit gamers
[7:34:06] assman_ny: Always want a little more than free
[7:34:18] N3llee: Well the battle pass in KR has like 3 different versions.  One is free, and then the paid version has tier pricing. The free version gives 0 honing mats while the paid version has free honing mats.
[7:34:30] abracka_: pretty hype to play immortal on my tablet tbh
[7:34:34] ClayMatioNation: Imagine getting guinely mad over a game that you enjoy just because there's microtransactions.
[7:34:34] 91Niki: When is diablo immportal even coming out ?

[7:36:47] ClayMatioNation: If WoW had a Battle Pass, what should it include?
[7:37:06] xziyn: I'm not sure, but contrary to popular beliefs, Koreans don't like the paying models they have lol
[7:37:20] osatox: battle pass in games should never be tied to power/advantages, just cosmetics
[7:37:36] dimofodi: Yea I don't think a paid battlepass in a game I pay monthly for is a good one. If it's free, yea
[7:37:37] theDirtyon3: Renown was a BP
[7:37:59] ClayMatioNation: They could theoretically retain more players with a BP if it was optimized well enough
[7:38:03] dyslexican1: it would be more profitable then subs
[7:38:04] Shadraak: Shadraak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months! 
[7:38:06] dutchie76: got 278 tier chest out of my vault!
[7:38:26] akia03: isnt a battlepass a 30 day thing so would be instead of sub?
[7:38:31] Rudric_Ice: any idea when 9.2.5 will drop ?
[7:38:32] dutchie76: finally 2 piece
[7:38:37] Snabido: I'll just stick to these pet/mount bundles blizz sell time to time
[7:38:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: wasn't the renown system basically a battle pass
[7:38:56] dyslexican1: Imagine, making "fun" things instead of grindy af things.
[7:38:58] ClayMatioNation: What if they did a Battle Pass themed around part of an expansion like if Wrath had a Nerubian BP?
[7:39:18] Mikayyy: nah put BiS gear in them so people will pay to unlock the full BP Kappa
[7:39:27] Shadraak: Finally got a computer again. Don’t think I’ll play wow for a while. But started lost ark the other day. Is fun
[7:39:44] yba_cribaby9000: doesnt keep me playing
[7:39:54] Mikayyy: well obviously lol
[7:40:03] xziyn: Sad part about Lost Ark being so good is that it kinda killed WoW here in KR lol
[7:40:05] JustAwaay: bonus roll on battle pass Kapp
[7:40:15] ClayMatioNation: If there's a mission table, the first BP reward would be a follower
[7:40:30] dyslexican1: Im more then down for a BP system over sub system.
[7:40:44] xziyn: I mean, I play on KR server, it's half dead currently
[7:40:48] theDirtyon3: to the right
[7:40:49] osatox: to the right
[7:40:51] Rudric_Ice: New Classes exclusively from the  Battle Pass LUL
[7:40:54] Jardon00: you can only see ones you haven't collected the first time around
[7:41:04] Aidler: BP could give perks to revigorate old content
[7:41:07] theDirtyon3: whelp we tried
[7:41:13] Reckless_Monk: Keep seeing KR WoW streamers late night when its haunting hours
[7:41:21] RaginCajun05: Look to your right
[7:41:23] onybear: To your right, by the pillar
[7:41:27] xziyn: China is huge, but KR is really tiny currently
[7:41:32] ClayMatioNation: I got tons of battle pass ideas for WoW. Should I make a video or is there a dev I can tweet? LUL
[7:41:35] theDirtyon3: left
[7:41:37] theDirtyon3: LUL
[7:41:54] Havoc_S1: Master chiefs armor after the deal@goes through lol
[7:42:08] Brodih_: warhammer online.... towCry
[7:42:08] Reckless_Monk: and all because KR had it for 3 years and then amassed so much content
[7:42:11] Reckless_Monk: for NA/EU
[7:42:17] theDirtyon3: ESO is still pretty healthy from what I can tell
[7:42:28] dyslexican1: Honestly, changing to a BP system would even be wrapped into them going away from a expansion based system, and instead just do content and story updates a few times a year.
[7:42:41] xziyn: No KR guild in the top 20 for this tier either, which is sad
[7:42:41] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583

[7:42:49] abracka_: i wish they would release a solid warhammer mmo. AoR was okay but def had a lot of faults
[7:42:57] ClayMatioNation: Yo I'd be down for some ESO with that new expansion. It looks excellent!
[7:43:02] Havoc_S1: I was kinda triggered with episode 3
[7:43:06] Reckless_Monk: When is End of Dragons coming out for GuildWars 2?
[7:43:18] xziyn: Already out no?

[7:44:05] stratiss: they are fixing it before steam release
[7:44:20] CYNIC308: GW2 badly underrated

[7:44:55] ClayMatioNation: I think it was Game Rant
[7:45:08] MisterBongwater: yeah GW2 marketing is ass, it's quietly awesome

[7:46:37] N3llee: sorry my man
[7:46:44] stratiss: tbf they had a lot more advertisements this xpac, but it was overshadowed by elden ring and LA
[7:47:08] xziyn: @Megatronxz He scares me constantly talking about no cinematic, feels like he's preparing us lol
[7:47:19] MisterBongwater: yeah I would say coming into GW2 new, the trek to your first 80 is a little rough, but once you get there, it explodes into massive content
[7:47:28] stratiss: oh for sure
[7:47:31] N3llee: thats actually good point
[7:47:49] N3llee: all the other things going on mmos, eith Eldren Ring, RWF and Lost Ark
[7:47:55] KOSTA_XB: Faultyfarm!
[7:48:29] Stronghammer38: SWTOR's newest "expansion" barely felt like an update. Really should have been delayed more.
[7:48:34] akia03: how long does the buff last?
[7:48:36] Rudric_Ice: time for blizz to nerf it
