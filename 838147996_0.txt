[0:29:48] rocthenite: i did not enjoy legion at all, i felt it sucked until 7.2.5
[0:29:51] syril: @rocthenite I started in MoP and I think this is the best xpac since then, legion was pretty fun but these new systems actually feel good to me
[0:30:10] syril: I agree it took a patch or two before I appreciated legion
[0:30:15] Its_Me_MG: ^ ^ Started in Classic, and the last time I was this invested in an expansion was Wrath

[0:30:31] ThatTwistedMetalGuy: Lot to do but not super grindy. Im sure some of it will wear off but systems are 10x better than BFA.
[0:30:51] MOLAR305: I'm with @mg__styles same feeling. and I dont feel like I have to grind. feels organic
[0:30:54] ThatTwistedMetalGuy: Question is how wack is it gonna get in 6 months.
[0:31:01] Mecabeast: i started in bfa >.>
[0:31:05] syril: I thought the BFA visions was the worst patch ever
[0:31:05] Its_Me_MG: @ThatTwistedMetalGuy i just took a massive shit, it too was better than BFA
[0:31:26] rocthenite: legion by the end was amazing but the first half of legion with leggos, and the raid difacultely going from you can bug mythic EN to YOU NEED TO CAP THE ENDLESS GRIND TO BE STAR ARUGER

[0:32:33] MOLAR305: depends on maintenance window
[0:32:55] potatolisk: oh ok so it could be longer
[0:33:06] ThatTwistedMetalGuy: Legion legos were a joke. I re rolled the same character 4 times trying to get what I needed and still didnt get it until nighthold.
[0:33:12] rocthenite: i gived up on bfa at the first chest since how bad getting azarite gear was for mythic +

[0:35:24] idenkaz_: towCry
[0:35:30] rocthenite: SL also helped out by actilely being in a good strong guild, where in legion i was adrift and in BFA the guild of legion buddies we form implouded since our main recruiter and the glue of most of the friendships have passed away a week before the expansion was released
[0:35:36] syril: I just like the choice of the systems this xpac, I can choose my soulbinds, covenant, legendary, ilevel of my leggo etc. its just a lot of fun
[0:36:54] swordart_19: Kyrian sub nerfed Ha Ha rogues KEKW
[0:37:05] Pojotmc: the only big problems the game has atm are how terrible the maw is and how now its much easier to run alts than it is to run multiple specs on the same character because of soul ash
[0:37:05] rocthenite: my only gripe with SL right now is conduits, it should be spec base or not have that 1 coin a day currentsy
[0:37:43] Ramgoth: I get darkest dungeon wibes from this screen. cool as hell

[0:38:33] Xon890: hey all, just ding 60 yesterday, Dest warlock here, which Covenant should I pick, asking for opions here..
[0:38:38] swordart_19: @pojotmc makes 0 sense you can get multiple legos on main just not all at once.
[0:38:48] Its_Me_MG: I get the 'Cuban pissed off vibes, due to not having a proper ride in the Maw'
[0:38:49] rocthenite: so maybe for necroload dks it hell
[0:39:14] swordart_19: @xon890 which you would join in real life 4Head for look feel theme and story
[0:39:28] rocthenite: i just love the fact the maw is chalanging
[0:39:47] rocthenite: after warfrounts where you have to try to lose
[0:39:54] Xon890: ah man, did not even think along that line.. Thanks..
[0:39:58] swordart_19: And has 0 reason to go there KEKW
[0:40:08] ThatTwistedMetalGuy: After a week and some gear maw loses that feeling. You just walk over it until your jailer capped.
[0:40:18] MOLAR305: it's only challenging in that you tend to just ignore most mobs so you don't incur more eye of the jailer
[0:40:21] swordart_19: @xon890 if you are meta slave your answer is on wowhead.
[0:40:22] Pojotmc: @swordart_19 you have to gate yourself on how strong you get those legendaries because you are time gated on soul ash. if you get two, they are both staying at 190 for awhile, if you try and run 3 specs they are staying 190 for a long time.

[0:41:43] Its_Me_MG: as for the Maw, i dont have much gripe, i just do the dailies, and kill rares til I get tier 4 eye and then i leave. Then go to Tor'Ghast and then log off to alts and repeat.
[0:41:53] Needdaann: ran it on a warlock last night and had like 7 infernals up at once LUL
[0:41:53] Pojotmc: @swordart_19 the point was that its easier to maintain alts with catchup mechanics than it is to maintain separate specs on a single character. you are better off just running a character for tanking, a character for healing, and a character for dps. what in the fuck are you even going on about dude.

[0:46:15] Staksor: why would veng get changes? they're fine
[0:46:21] Drakenking: @syril because they were busted and it was only something like a 3% overall nerf

[1:11:12] Ezekyler: yeah a lot of quality and get scrap is bullshit
[1:11:13] ThatTuesdayGuy: 100%
[1:11:13] sklingel: callings are dumb
[1:11:13] Bruizedfish: yup
[1:11:14] Tru1485: @Towelliee Ion did say there was a bug were legacy dmg wasn't working in Legion content that has been fixed
[1:11:15] MrGattz: and the stupid seed things
[1:11:16] Betrys: i hated it
[1:11:18] Azphelle: Honestly, mood
[1:11:21] SeaJ4Y: i see my gold noticeably go up at vendoring

[1:11:33] LoremasterMarthan: I have got 3 conduits since the expansion launched from those dumb bogs
[1:11:36] raldrik: It was like that in BFA but you knew it before you did your emmisary and could choose not to take your time
[1:11:36] Affiiance: I just want the conduits from the World Boss to be 100% drop rate
[1:11:40] Lueko_: i like the gold :)
[1:11:41] Brogdan: I think they need some vanity chase items in the calling bags
[1:11:42] Ezekyler: Reven
[1:11:43] Betrys: if they wanna give me gold give me gold...getting trash feels awful
[1:11:49] Staksor: epic ones have a chance for a mount

[1:12:15] Megadisaster24: Epic Callings should have like 100 Soul Ash
[1:12:20] Broomba: Multiple dollar company
[1:12:22] Katabolic: They should really fill some these gaps like calling chests with cosmetics. Answer to everything when people think they do too much for little reward.

[2:28:33] Redacted_: its very hard to beat my veng dps as havoc but i can

[2:28:37] silitung: I thought Brewmaster was gonna be 'THE TANK' for this Xpac

[2:29:15] Aptness: vengance DH huge. mega tank and brings the magic buff on target
[2:29:24] I_DoctorSatan_I: @janaparks That's mainly for PvP
[2:29:30] chillmodez: is he playing on EU or something?
[2:29:35] GoGetItKo: Towelliee you can only loot one item at a time. Gotta go back to drop it at the pool then come back for more

[2:31:38] I_DoctorSatan_I: @janaparks Blizzard tied our "AoE" to a legendary "Soulforge Embers" where our Tar Trap + Flare ignited enemies in the Tar Trap to burn "xxx fire damage for 10 seconds"
[2:31:39] steelreign0080: easier than perdition hold tho
[2:31:40] jordzkie05: i only do that wq to spawn the plagueroc mount

[2:33:09] I_DoctorSatan_I: @janaparks It's cool and all, but the CD's just sucks een though our AoE DPS is improved. I use Fang's though to give my pets a extra 20% to crit damage. It's not bad, but it's "passive" which i like.
[2:33:15] Nosdunk24: How is he playing? I thought servers were down for maintenance ?
[2:33:17] Nimzo1337: It’s also on your back

[2:33:42] jordzkie05: @Towelliee it's the world boss that drop's the plagueroc mount
[2:33:43] janaparks: @I_DoctorSatan_I yeah i leveled BM i really like it better but MM just does more damage
[2:33:54] D3V1L_MAN: If you don't do world quests, how else do you get anima?
[2:33:56] Mecabeast: 15 red and 15 blue in the big pool
[2:34:01] Deathkanigit101: @Towelliee looks like limit is doing DK, brewmaster for tanks to start. this raid./
[2:34:04] coachingpotatoes: i've been shit annoyed with the lack of explanations/ MAP MARKS with daily qs
[2:34:04] Fireahwk: Fireahwk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:34:09] Clay2K_: @Towelliee oh weird. I never did that quest.....maybe not a required one
[2:34:10] Clicklesly: Storyline feels better anyway tbh ^^
[2:34:23] solsaver12: I agree coachingpotatoes
[2:34:31] xerouztv: How is towelliee playing when the servers are offline for maintenance
[2:34:32] Floordood: it's not 100% drop rate
[2:34:38] Holysal: this takes 2 mins lol
[2:34:41] Broomba: DC EU for me
[2:34:43] OldGrumpyJon: Anyone else have problem getting back into playing after a break? I started the new shadowlands quests, but just not had any passion to play again
[2:34:43] JeffreyVegas: yeah thata not required quest T
[2:34:46] aumixp: Who cares about wq reward.. just doing the damm callings etc for rep
[2:34:47] Rottencoarse: yeah lag
[2:34:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: @janaparks very true. I used to be MM years ago, but when BM becasme a "good" spec, i never went back to MM. I really like BM spec especially having 2 pets at my side.
[2:34:50] daniel85mg: rip WOW
[2:34:53] Zechnubis: Ha! Not lvl60 yet??? Noob, expansion has been out for ages now! ;) (Yes i know youre an NA player, just kidding)

[2:35:12] marshmallow110: ypou het nothing
[2:35:15] jordzkie05: it's not that bad to do as WQ because people are aiming for a chance to spawn the "violet mistake" world boss that drops the plagueroc mount @Towelliee
[2:35:18] marshmallow110: get*
[2:35:24] pinjones: chat, what is rwf?
[2:35:24] solsaver12: I gotten a 207 ring yesterday of world boss

[2:35:54] amricatt: @pinjones Race World First
[2:35:54] mvxzero: OTK having a fuck show again lol
[2:35:55] sagethemage40: i feel like the Race to WF coverage is a bit saturated
[2:36:02] sagethemage40: OTK is a joke honextly
[2:36:06] frallo010: @pinjones Really wet farts
[2:36:07] therotkiw: cant wait for the next renown chunk
[2:36:08] janaparks: @I_DoctorSatan_I i know all i can have now are dumb normal pets nothing cool for MM
[2:36:18] CardinalTX: OTK is very much cringe
[2:36:18] linus95b: What world boss is it?
[2:36:22] pinjones: @jordzkie05 @amricatt ah i see. thanks
[2:36:23] bdibz: how can you be on if the game is down for update??
[2:36:23] mvxzero: @sagethemonk it's more thant a comedy show then a ORG lol
[2:36:24] jordzkie05: wow's popular again
[2:36:29] maccaruso: Going to miss Preach casting though. He really has a natural talent for it.
[2:36:48] Maydie6066: Maydie6066 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 1/2 a year? what a waste lol. Hammers up for the Kyrian and Towel y'all!!
[2:36:49] SinicalDev: Need a Redzone type broadcast
[2:36:50] sagethemage40: yeah agreed
[2:36:51] liviu_81: a calzone will do also
[2:36:52] paulson14: @Towelliee I can't watch hermanmiller because he has a dallas cowboys cup on his desk hahahaaha
[2:36:53] big_daddy_glady: wait how is he playing with servers down?
[2:36:55] jordzkie05: @Towelliee are you getting WOTLK vibes with this surging popularity with shadowlands?
[2:36:55] L0mashu: Can someone explain what how i know what guilds i can join? realm wise
[2:37:00] Affiiance: During Christmas with kids its understandable
[2:37:02] Wcvechten: Believe he wants to chill with his family during christmas
[2:37:05] Clicklesly: It's kinda sad there wasn't a proper central thing for this year, would've been easier with all the online coverage too ^^
[2:37:06] bdibz: how you playing if servers are down bro???
[2:37:07] PvtHudson093: he wants to raid too
[2:37:15] Deflexure: When does the race begin?
[2:37:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: @janaparks having a pet as a MM reduces your damage. Being a "Lone Wolf" gives your spec more danage output.
[2:37:22] mvxzero: @bdibz EU
[2:37:26] the_chungis: When the servers go up
[2:37:30] Floordood: All the people asking how he is playing. it's EU
[2:37:35] bdibz: so EU is done before NA??

[2:39:00] Wcvechten: LFR, the real race
[2:39:06] jordzkie05: @Towelliee it's part of the story helping the ooze people iirc
[2:39:10] the_chungis: First wing of LFR opens

[2:39:43] SlaySmile: what the addon for ur profile health/class
[2:40:13] CardinalTX: LFR champions rise up!
[2:40:21] Romnus: Remove LFR? Why? What's wrong with having a way for casuals to experience the content?
[2:40:21] Kromede: mojo
[2:40:22] Dazart99: lfr should never wipe. it should just be for casuals to see the fights
[2:40:24] SlaySmile: !addon
[2:40:24] GiraffeHydra_: @feherlofia123 assuming its because they don't want to give an additional gear route for normal/heroic right away
[2:40:25] burfurlur: coxManleee LFR time
[2:40:25] Doog45: yes rank 3
[2:40:34] aliceuwu_x: lfr is harder than heroic LUL
[2:40:44] coachingpotatoes: i wish they intruduced these shits one at a time. i really can't follow what i need to what the fucking what now
[2:40:44] Doog45: yea have to finish one wing I think
[2:40:48] Clicklesly: I mean, we're getting over 1k per wing now (assuming layer 8 really is doable)
[2:40:49] dchantrell: !ui

[2:41:01] tocu: without adventures you would have 740 ash going into the week
[2:41:05] eurasianstation: isnt the servers down?
[2:41:07] tocu: you need 1200 for rank 3
[2:41:08] tacsquatch: layer 6 sucked
[2:41:08] FradeFIN: whats RWF?
[2:41:21] CozzyFlannel: Does EU and NA start WF at the same time?

[2:41:21] nodramajustpizzaa: can you earn ash for levels you already did on torghast?
[2:41:22] tacsquatch: yeah tanks are op imo in torghast
[2:41:22] mrkenndy: @FradeFIN raiding world first
[2:41:26] Epicsapphire1988: @Mayonaise87 EU
[2:41:26] gorilla_quantistico: on a tank is a joke
[2:41:27] nodramajustpizzaa: anyone know?
[2:41:29] SunTzu514: unless you're a rogue
[2:41:31] FradeFIN: ty
[2:41:36] DarthWrex: Dont we get maw mount at floor 8?
[2:41:43] CardinalTX: LFR! This is the way!
[2:41:48] 8bitbarbarian: @TwoHeartedFish that's the schedule at least
[2:41:48] talic420: ya but you not an average player
[2:41:50] maccaruso: I kept getting wrecked in Layer 6 as a Fury warrior. I switched to tank spec and lol'ed my way through it.
[2:41:50] gooberrelic: how do you change to EU?
[2:42:19] Vanhoek: so swapped covs took me less than a few hours to catch back up with renown
[2:42:23] shamsael: all of my characters are tanks. torghast usually easy, but some runs i've got super tanky builds, but not enough damage buffs and the boss gets his enrage buff eventually if you can't burn him
[2:42:29] Collected1: PhilZ_z : it's just an EU account
[2:42:31] nodramajustpizzaa: can you farm Ash from older layers in torghast? anyone know?
[2:42:38] TheVanquished_: gotta pay for an EU account @PhilZ_z
[2:42:40] AnubiS1690: @Towelliee Man, did you get a chance you play Cyberpunk 2077 yet?? This game is so sick on my rig
[2:42:44] SvanDark: Servers comes up in 3 hours and 34 minutes

[2:42:49] Toddclemm1: 11 Pacific i believe
[2:42:51] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee if i switch from dps to tank spec, do the rewards in the vault change?
[2:42:53] talic420: that is y people are making others for different fights you got it
[2:43:04] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ can't farm old levels. once you clear a level/wing, you can't get ash from that level/wing again
[2:43:16] Sh4nti: Cyberbugs cohhLUL
[2:43:23] AnubiS1690: @Towelliee yeah dont overhype it and youll have fun. Its pretty sick
[2:43:24] NickTheFridge: Wait we can craft our level 3 legendary this week?
[2:43:28] brodacious43: What’s up man! How are ya today?
[2:43:28] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ maybe when we rotate through everything, and get the week 1 wings again,, we'll get to re-run the level 1s there. not sure
[2:43:28] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael i see , i read somewhere online layer 8 will be replayable and get ash from it
[2:43:30] CardinalTX: @nodramajustpizza_ I thought so....ask from every layer each week.....or am i wrong?
[2:43:30] deedeemegadoodooo: its a fun game
[2:43:30] at1c: Its very buggy at the moment from personal experience I would wait to play Cyberpunk 2077
[2:43:33] pabskis: what name plates is he using?
[2:43:36] deedeemegadoodooo: nothing could have lived up to the hype
[2:43:42] sendboom: how are you playing rn
[2:43:46] JiberishUI: @stiltoe plater
[2:43:55] Vanhoek: What world boss is up today?
[2:43:55] Sielu11628: @toastfarmer4 He's the boss
[2:43:55] 2chest_1head: Thats BiS ret, gonna make today
[2:43:56] Epicsapphire1988: @toastfarmer4 EU
[2:43:57] nodramajustpizzaa: @Teflontex i read online that once you get to layer 8 you can redo 8 and like a weekly quest so you dont have to redo old layers
[2:44:03] therotkiw: mad para is the vanilla of live
[2:44:06] Toddclemm1: it looks like elvui but idk
[2:44:07] pabskis: @Jiberishxd ty
[2:44:08] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ that would be weird if so. the time gating on legendaries seems important. farmable torghast would screw things up
[2:44:10] wanderlust81: @towelliee classes that still struggle in Torghast won't be happy floor's 2, 3 and 5 difficulty increased
[2:44:11] TompsonX: And buy the game
[2:44:14] TompsonX: again
[2:44:15] woohdakidd: you are playing in China Kappa
[2:44:16] DrWraithjr: :) Mr. Worldwide!
[2:44:17] TompsonX: LUL
[2:44:17] pokechakra: MP for Ret as well
[2:44:21] mandarinetip: ouch that hunter nerf
[2:44:21] liviu_81: PogChamp
[2:44:27] Clicklesly: Yeah, the NA beta server is still down Kappa
[2:44:37] woohdakidd: does clay still play on your EU acc @Towelliee
[2:44:37] modonaut: play classic on downtime :)
[2:44:42] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael farmable layers but i dont think wings. but again i dont know how torghast really works tbh all i know is i need 2 more layers to get my legendary ash required
[2:44:44] Adiuva: @Towelliee What is your thought on rogues currently? Was between that and feral, but upkeep on bleeds for feral seems annoying
[2:44:45] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee if i switch from dps to tank, do some gear pieces like trinkets change in the vault when i check? Or will it stay dps which i check on first?
[2:44:47] NickTheFridge: Yo chat can we make our 225 level 3 legendary this week?
[2:44:51] kreff_: does WFR start today?
[2:44:53] MrKray2: this the 1st i have heard about paragon what i sit?
[2:44:58] Vanhoek: The hunter nerf isnt terrible. Kinda sucks for pvp tho.
[2:44:59] pokechakra: If u make a EU account do u have to buy the game and all packs all over again ?
[2:45:02] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael do you mean wings? im talking redoable layers from a wing that given week
[2:45:07] pokechakra: Xpacks
[2:45:11] Vanhoek: The rogue nerfs on the other hand alittle overboard
[2:45:17] Professor_Oddy: how is he playing rn?
[2:45:24] Densetsu_: Getting The Mad Paragon tomorrow on my Ret Kreygasm lets go
[2:45:25] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee u still maining the pally right now? They seem kinda squish compared to vDH, Druid and monk tanks :(
[2:45:25] woohdakidd: clay your long lost cusion Kappa
[2:45:29] iKorpen: hOw ArE YOu PlaYiNg RIgHt NOw
[2:45:33] 101deathbringer: you playing beta
[2:45:39] Xehanort1986: EU
[2:45:40] Professor_Oddy: okay buddy
[2:45:41] TrashWizardd: EU
[2:45:42] Floordood: @ikorpen lmao
[2:45:43] Clay2K_: Different Clay chat, dont get excited
[2:45:45] nodramajustpizzaa: @iKorpen hes EU
[2:45:53] MrGattz: id watch

[2:46:03] Dephix: Why wouldn’t you level as ret?
[2:46:07] Sollice: IM ON EU TARDS STOP ASKING something like that
[2:46:07] Panadol324: No just put a INFO on the screen :D it will by the best way :D
[2:46:09] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ if they made a layher farmable, it would mean there's no soul ash cap. i don't think they'd do that.
[2:46:10] FatChase: There's another country other than NA? GET OUTTA HERE
[2:46:11] Sh4nti: React to youtube videos on tuesdays POGGERS
[2:46:13] Technogre: hes a streamer hes allowed on during maintenance

[2:46:23] KeleStraza: lol

[2:46:33] MikeGus: BabyRage
[2:46:34] Densetsu_: Fucking streamers BabyRage
[2:46:35] liviu_81: Outrageous!!!
[2:46:37] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael but i mean wouldnt there be a cap but you can farm layers and itll stop on a specific number? that would make more sense to me.
[2:46:37] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee is on his private Shadowlands Server :)
[2:46:38] kirkules78: Sad part is some people actually believe that
[2:46:42] Kinghorn: god dang streamer privilege
[2:46:44] Professor_Oddy: The Mad Paragon. Pog
[2:46:47] Sh4nti: cohhLUL
[2:46:53] Nuhaso: So with World boss will be up now?
[2:46:56] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael im only saying this because im scared i wont be able to do layer 7 or 8 then what do i do to get my legendary? feeldBADman
[2:47:02] Kromede: secret streamer server obviously
[2:47:08] coolstorynoob: towelliee when i see you at blizzcon you are getting punched in the forehead
[2:47:09] TheLucifer0g: playing wow in the single player mode
[2:47:09] dreadpiraterobeebop: How're you playing right now?
[2:47:17] dreadpiraterobeebop: Am I taking crazy pills?
[2:47:23] Kromede: secret streamer server obviously
[2:47:24] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ so far, each layer has given less than the previous layer, so you shouldn't fall too far behind
[2:47:26] Kinghorn: yes dreadpiraterobeebop
[2:47:29] woohdakidd: hows your ping on EU
[2:47:31] Sh4nti: EU
[2:47:35] Xehanort1986: I hope the World Boss that drops my BiS Unholy DK legendary ;o
[2:47:36] Bigbharash: just rename you EU toon to Naresettowel
[2:47:37] dreadpiraterobeebop: Ohhhh
[2:47:46] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ remember, if it's new wings rotating in, then you haven't done layer 1 of that wing yet, which is where like half the ash comes from anyway
[2:48:12] woohdakidd: ez
[2:48:20] sendboom: u could probably do it at lvl 49 as a prot pally
[2:48:21] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael that sounds good. i only need 2 more runs before i can make my legendary i have all the mats already lol im so bored of Torghast at this point
[2:48:23] snowmang94: @Towelliee is this a new Prot Pally? Why?
[2:48:24] nodramajustpizzaa: @shamsael good point
[2:48:28] therotkiw: paly main on a paly alt is almost cheating!
[2:48:29] AudioJaq: Mad Paragon is "bis" for raid rets too isnt it?
[2:49:01] northcub: classic is up
[2:49:16] Alliewh33lz: Alliewh33lz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:49:29] Yoistt: Are servers not down?
[2:49:30] shamsael: @nodramajustpizza_ the first two weeks, they unlocked layers 1 through 3, just changed up the wings. Layer 6 was available for week 3. I'm going to assume this reset will still be capped at Layer 6, but we'll get different wings.
[2:49:30] ZabberzTV: what does mad paragon do again?
[2:49:31] wagutoxd: wtf you playing? beta?
[2:49:34] Kromede: classic KEKW
[2:49:40] thegummibearmassacre: LULW

[2:49:59] sendboom: cant wait for BFA classic
[2:50:07] kunjutsu_: what is that XP addon on the top of his screen called? anyone know
[2:50:11] pigbenls: NAXX out....and its down. Classic over in one day.
[2:50:13] shamsael: Shadowlands Classic will be pog
[2:50:17] snowmang94: @Towelliee what is the point of them re-releasing the expansions for WoW classic? Doesn't that defeat the purpose? LOLOLOL
[2:50:27] fistofnature: classic LUL
[2:50:27] CallThatReal: can't wait for BFA classic tbh
[2:50:31] CallThatReal: islands all over again

[2:51:10] shamsael: I think "Classic" is everything before the Cata map redesign. Cata Classic is an oxymoron, IMO
[2:51:11] solsaver12: I think Classic will stop at TBC or WOTLK

[2:51:41] schizowillie: Good Morning
[2:52:00] solsaver12: ya its sad
[2:52:02] shamsael: I'm not that interested in TBC classic, since I lived it. I just wanted to see what Prot Paladin felt like to play in Vanilla, since I came to the class in TBC and didn't know the struggle.
[2:52:02] GoGetItKo: I, for one, am excited for Classic ShadowLands coming out in 2045
[2:52:05] fewyn: classic is dead
[2:52:17] Floordood: poor dh

[2:53:24] nickyptheg: thought servers were down

[2:53:53] solsaver12: lol
[2:54:07] schizowillie: Hammer of Justice during rain from above it is funny
[2:54:16] coffeecreeamer: KEKW
[2:54:17] MOLAR305: havok is sucking
[2:54:18] CADZtv: you do more damage
[2:54:20] Kinghorn: havoc is just a flaming pile
[2:54:23] CADZtv: tuning fucked
[2:54:23] redbulladin: on my lvl 52 hunter i was killing 60
[2:54:26] GoGetItKo: BabyRage get rid of streamer buffs BabyRage
[2:54:27] Saiteck: I bet they are bad
[2:54:27] shamsael: the level based mechanics seem to have been toned down
[2:54:27] redbulladin: aim shot one tap kills
[2:54:28] dowjy: how is towelliee playing right now?
[2:54:29] vic_ave: the suck that bad
[2:54:33] therotkiw: bad guy is bad
[2:54:35] Kromede: beta
[2:54:38] vic_ave: he is playing on EU
[2:54:41] OhNoNotAgain: @dowjy Its a magical land called EU
[2:54:41] nickyptheg: is this eu server
[2:54:42] JiMBOJiM69: EU servers
[2:54:43] aliceuwu_x: FeelsBadMan
[2:54:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: class tunning for you right there LUL
[2:54:47] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee You do more damange because of the scaling, i mean try Legion raids at 50 and at 60, you will see the difference Kappa
[2:54:53] GorSTL: maybe he shouldn't pick a fight then
[2:54:53] bhoove40: i had a hpal in 2s yesterday heal for 700k hitting 29k world of glorys at 2100 rating lol
[2:54:53] extremevf: im pretty sure the 5% buff is not enough ,, havoc is so weak
[2:54:54] CADZtv: well the scalling fucked
[2:54:57] shamsael: for pvp, level just tells you what gear you have. doesn't seem to be a major impact on hit chance or crushing blows and stuff like that
[2:55:00] dawnovun: How tf is this dude playing? Servers are down for me?
[2:55:08] JiMBOJiM69: eu
[2:55:15] shamsael: @dawnovun EU server
[2:55:17] bcp1028: nice glowing weiner on your wall back there
[2:55:20] coachingpotatoes: the good servers are still up
[2:55:21] saltinecrcker: i think it depends on gear dependency
[2:55:22] CADZtv: did bfa just have to much power or something? lol
[2:55:25] TheRealOsse: is this character mythic geared from BFA?
[2:55:43] CozzyFlannel: Isn't it unfair that NA gets a head start?
[2:55:51] MOLAR305: NA is the beta test
[2:55:56] coachingpotatoes: damn still trusting on method on this run
[2:56:08] Deathraid82: They don't though. THey count the time it takes to kill
[2:56:09] dawnovun: Blizzard is really disrespectful and stupid for not just opening mythic for EU and US at the exact same time when both sides have servers online.
[2:56:11] Kromede: some bullshit with level squish, my garrison toons 45-49 can one shot the garrison rare spider, with 50-60 its a boss
[2:56:14] ObsidianHealer: @CozzyFlannel not really cause EU has beaten NA a bunch in the pasted
[2:56:20] bsraider: a fresh 60 havoc is dog shit
[2:56:27] shamsael: if NA clears first, but the EU guild clears in less time because of the different reset time, does EU win?
[2:56:27] BCrums: Did the reset happen yet?
[2:56:32] BCrums: Are US servers up?
[2:56:36] Deathraid82: psh i'm 184 and its still poopoo
[2:56:37] shamsael: Is it on time-from-reset, or literal first?
[2:56:40] nickyptheg: Complexity hates having the head start, they wish blizz could find a time that would work for everyone
[2:56:54] dhonpaul: did you finish heroic ?
[2:56:59] Deathraid82: time in raid. First pull to kill. I'm psure
[2:57:07] Cerbrus0: @Towelliee did you saw the last minute mythic tunning in wowhead?
[2:57:08] dawnovun: Blizzard is really disrespectful and stupid for not just opening mythic for EU and US at the exact same time when both sides have servers online. It shows how disconnected they are.
[2:57:26] tootlepoof: They could just wait you know lol LUL
[2:57:29] TexasPower: LUL
[2:57:30] axxowow: a good player make havoc usefull :D, prob most of you are shit :P
[2:57:36] Kinghorn: LUL
[2:57:39] Syllvn: @dawnovun Dude this is a crazy huge game they can't just change it for some mythic race.
[2:57:43] TexasPower: true
[2:57:47] aikopooh: LUL
[2:57:48] smashwow: 3 days later
[2:57:59] shamsael: @dawnovun race to worldfirst isn't a game mechanic. They can't base their business decision around some artificial competition the community made up.
[2:58:00] Phalian01: i dont get it NA and EU have the same chances. there when NA is going to sleep EU is starting so
[2:58:01] IzacCS: i think it would be more fun to watch if they started at the same time
[2:58:04] Berexios123: does china still get 2 resets a week?
[2:58:10] Cerbrus0: @Towelliee did you saw the last minute mythic tunning in wowhead?
[2:58:13] xLink_tv: @dawnovun obviously hasnt managed any servers and it shows LUL
[2:58:16] Kroovius: How are you playing if servers are down?
[2:58:24] pk99: the realm status website is a huge Jebaited right now
[2:58:29] Deathraid82: hes on eu
[2:58:33] shamsael: @xLink_tv lolinorite?
[2:58:36] Holysal: @Kroovius theres more than one region in the world lol
[2:58:39] dawnovun: I predict that it will take a solid week for these guys to clear mythic.
[2:58:42] axxowow: china ftw
[2:58:44] br0fest0r: I think if they see guilds progressing too fast in mythic they will just stealth buff the last bosses
[2:58:47] CADZtv: asians dont fuck around

[2:59:22] MetallicusGaming: Boblackson34 ALOT lol
[2:59:26] ramee_is_randys_dodo: I thought the Asiatic release of Mythic was supposed to drop this expansion same as EU
[2:59:27] ViinaPlz: Never made a pala.. still fairly new to the game. Might try it out.
[2:59:29] manmower: only way to prevent them from winning would be to fill the raid with skeletons
[2:59:45] nickyptheg: maybe that is why they never win though, being well rested is underrrated
[2:59:58] Kinghorn: the shield the shade gets is fucking massive

[3:00:35] CoyoteKai: if limit loses you gotta drink gamer girl bath water
[3:00:47] ramee_is_randys_dodo: @kylern58 no way
[3:00:50] andre1023: I think method has a chance
[3:01:08] borathius: method is a bunch of bench warmers and newcomers. they don't have a chance
[3:01:29] smashwow: method has a chance at top 20-ish
[3:01:29] Metternic: Its a great race already
[3:01:31] Doog45: method wont be competitive this first tier imo
[3:01:34] mmrghost7: w8ing room HYYYYYPE towRee towRee towRee

[3:01:54] Clay2K_: there were 2 under the last architect dude you killed
[3:01:55] cruzeal: @Doog45 sco already said they wouldn't be
[3:02:05] EvoCyberNation: The bad thing is, these are pro teams trying to do it. Perhaps they can still progress without major changes but! If they expose the bosses they can be held responsible for their actions?
[3:02:07] DudeInARobe: That moment when you get hit with 8 ads
[3:02:07] Devurf: got 2 ads
[3:02:10] DudeInARobe: Fuckkkk
[3:02:17] borathius: that's not twitch ads that's towilee adds and he's very transparent about it
[3:02:18] aleagues: 9 ads wtd
[3:02:18] ObsidianHealer: 8 here
[3:02:19] coachingpotatoes: i mean, they need the exposure to get rid of the past events as fast as possible
[3:02:19] CADZtv: lol
[3:02:20] The_Katana_Spamer: hey when the 7 ads are done, care to repeat the last 4 mins ?
[3:02:20] verdant85: verdant85 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[3:02:22] ramee_is_randys_dodo: @cruzeal thats a lie, cause he has mentiond numerous times they will be competeing as if they were before... lol
[3:02:22] bakurathewolf: bakurathewolf subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! OWO

[3:03:20] CADZtv: getting
[3:03:22] Plommy: the gods will provide
[3:03:28] CrossThread: i see no ads
[3:03:41] ramee_is_randys_dodo: @MetallicusGaming thing is Sco has gone back and forth on his word like 9000 times since he first announced "It wouldnt be competitive"
[3:03:43] Its22Forever: Hey Towelliee
[3:03:43] borathius: @crossthread subs don't get ads

[3:04:15] 91Niki: What's an ad? Kappa
[3:04:17] Cello_73: I'm hoping Complexity can get another W1st
[3:04:18] NeoJon82: No Adds for Turbo too.
[3:04:19] borathius: @the_katana_spamer lmao
[3:04:27] andre1023: gone back and forth because he probably is surprised by the guild itself
[3:04:29] WoW_StandalonE: no subs don't get either lol
[3:04:37] DudeInARobe: @mrkenndy I have no idea lol 8 ads at 30 sec a piece is a first for me on this platform.

[3:04:42] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Vivelli (warning)
[3:04:42] grumpyybear420: no servers currently available..... How are you on??
[3:04:52] ry_wardenn: how is he playing when servers are down?
[3:04:56] redbulladin: would love if echo wins
[3:04:58] nickyptheg: eu server
[3:04:58] cabalish: do u raid after reset ?
[3:04:59] Cello_73: agreed, hope not too cocky and just confident lol
[3:04:59] 91Niki: He's on EU
[3:05:00] Its22Forever: he's on eu
[3:05:00] redbulladin: get a real race going
[3:05:03] Twigz_KC: Can't imagine to see what M Sledgefist will be like
[3:05:04] ry_wardenn: ah okay
[3:05:05] borathius: @warden0614 test servers
[3:05:06] DarkAnub1s: @Towelliee do you know if there is an add on for companions
[3:05:11] redbulladin: for the thrill of it
[3:05:18] Its22Forever: eu doesnt have a server down today
[3:05:20] ventu105: OTK wins
[3:05:22] CADZtv: echo has a high chance honestly since they practically only miss sco
[3:05:22] LSBreed: damn need to break out my limit shirt today

[3:05:29] Cello_73: agreed

[3:05:45] Tipsybasil: hows it going @Towelliee. waiting to get my that PS5 from bestbuy restoock day! lol
[3:05:46] ramee_is_randys_dodo: Im waiting for that Underdog win
[3:05:47] Phalian01: Apes or someone
[3:05:48] mrbzombie: towelliee if you gift everyone in chat a sub we can all confirm that subs don't get ads
[3:05:50] dawnovun: Method has no chance on winning, they booted half there guildies who were perverts. You can't take a new raid in and expect to win World First.
[3:05:51] bootymessiah101: @Towelliee King Towelliee how are you this morning sir?
[3:05:53] andre1023: I want a newcomer as well

[3:05:59] andre1023: would be nice to see
[3:05:59] MetallicusGaming: Unwealthy*
[3:06:00] xFinerx: Who would your underdog win prediction be?
[3:06:05] Du4lgame: would love to see aversion win!
[3:06:09] CADZtv: but isnt fatshark semi hardcore not hardcore
[3:06:10] nickyptheg: I hope a no name guild from Zimbabwe wins
[3:06:17] dawnovun: Method stands literally no chance on winning this time, they booted half there guildies who were perverts. You can't take a new raid in and expect to win World First.
[3:06:19] Frustrated_Nerd: Shadehounds in the Beastwarrens today
[3:06:19] antori_92: is this eu?
[3:06:26] Cello_73: I'd love to see Future win honestly lol slootFistLove

[3:06:34] Its22Forever: @antori1992 yes
[3:06:39] andre1023: Method still has a chance lol, people are so ridicolous.
[3:06:44] antori_92: yey <3
[3:06:56] TheRomkey: are you on EU?
[3:07:04] Artivicii: Fatshark make some good games
[3:07:07] Gerr_x: time is what most people cant commit to top guilds
[3:07:08] Its22Forever: @KorinTV yea
[3:07:10] andre1023: this is literally what they do
[3:07:16] LSBreed: future lost a couple people right before mythic that definitely hurts them
[3:07:16] steelreign0080: and some people have jobs lol
[3:07:16] ms_enyo: Yeah Method will put up a fight still
[3:07:17] CADZtv: @andre1023 method is a brand new roster my man
[3:07:18] Brodih_: yep, quality over quantity
[3:07:18] Cello_73: @andre1023 maybe but no one cares for them due to what happen. They were not innocent so hope they dont have any chance
[3:07:19] thegummibearmassacre: LULW
[3:07:28] D3m0nHunt3r666: Method KEKW
[3:07:34] fistofnature: yeah i dont play for echo Kappa

[3:07:56] Drogdorf: apart from Sco, I dont even know who are in Method atm lol
[3:07:57] nickyptheg: I wouldn't be surprised if a Russian guild wins this time
[3:07:57] Kalitvenec: 2020Suspicious
[3:07:58] spatuladogg: Hey towel and chat!
[3:07:58] jessielight: covid kinda evens the score. so many out of work so more time to raid.
[3:07:59] Vivelli: if they do well right off the bat, in a brand new team, ill be utterly shocked
[3:08:00] smashwow: when SCO says himself. we're not competing this tier. it's not happening folks
[3:08:01] dozilla: So what are the odds of first and second place ? Limit the fav then who, Echo?
[3:08:02] Gallowez: When does the race start?
[3:08:04] TheRomkey: who do you think wins the race, Limit? @Towelliee
[3:08:07] andre1023: @JAYMURCS true, however the mission doesnt change. Im saying they have a chance not a shoe in winner. Big difference
[3:08:08] Billo0w: whens reset?
[3:08:12] PlexRP: this is the most excited I've been for a RWF
[3:08:16] confewsed: Obviously Nihilum will win boys

[3:15:27] aesirsghost: @ramee_is_randys_dodo
[3:15:36] sevens777s: @Towelliee so your guild is semi-hardcore then ?
[3:15:37] MOLAR305: the complexity channel overlay has a top 10 list tracker
[3:15:43] coachingpotatoes: @Manacaym, yeah whole new roster because of that and shit. which is why no one should believe in them right now
[3:15:46] Nubshi54: Method is pretty much completely new people now. Nobody really knows how theyre gonna do
[3:15:53] pereadin: Method even stated they wouldn’t be competitive in the RWF scene for 3 more tiers.

[3:16:17] ramee_is_randys_dodo: @pereadin then why has his stream titles been RWF Prepping
[3:16:28] Syllvn: Sloot called Future Hardcore. 1 step below World First.
[3:16:30] ramee_is_randys_dodo: and "Preparing for WFR "
[3:16:31] steelreign0080: It'd be interesting to see progression broken down by time in the raid versus just boss kills.
[3:16:34] Utmost777: cool, i dig that
[3:16:36] Kelloggs9: What covenant did you choose for Prot Pal @Towelliee
[3:16:42] TheFuriyon: !btag

[3:16:47] TheFuriyon: No EU btag?
[3:16:55] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)

[3:17:28] zabrav: Why does it matter?
[3:17:28] Nerdmeat_: why do you think there is such a disparity between alliance and horde when it comes to raiding?
[3:17:31] TheFuriyon: I could swear your EU btag was #1488 or something along those lines
[3:17:34] ventu105: how about survival hunter they are good?
[3:17:35] kipling_tr: I’d love an alliance guild to give it a real go
[3:17:46] ramee_is_randys_dodo: Alliance LUL
[3:17:57] ThatGuyFayde: @Jagarot alliance is for cucks, we dont take seriously at all
[3:17:58] fistofnature: for every good alliance guild there are 5 good horde ones
[3:18:01] steelreign0080: you guys clear it yet?
[3:18:05] BopThat: Rip rogues holy cow
[3:18:11] BopThat: dog shitted on
[3:18:25] TheFuriyon: I feel like WM benefits was a bandaid fix, but it didn't help the case
[3:18:25] LandyYo: They nerf rogues?
[3:18:26] thiccsushi: ion saying that pretty much means if you want to raid competitively swap or stop complaining

[3:18:32] coachingpotatoes: they're putting a big round of nerfs though. rogues are not the first nor the last
[3:18:33] mobbo: It is what it is....
[3:18:33] aikopooh: so deal with it
[3:18:35] dmaa17: how many days you guess before denathrius is down?
[3:18:38] ventu105: is survival hunter good?
[3:18:39] c0ldbloodead: god forbid they give an exp buff for new players to migrate over to alliance or something smart like that.
[3:18:43] Powerofwar_1: why are so many people playing horde?
[3:18:44] Gragnar: obligatory "what? the servers are up?" :P jk
[3:18:45] xideontv: allied races were his chance to fix it, and he fucked up big
[3:18:49] idenkaz_: alliance is pretty dead ngl.
[3:18:50] axxowow: Alliance is for real man who like a challenge :S
[3:18:54] chuckj831: id play horde but charicters r ugly
[3:18:56] sevens777s: @Towelliee is just racials thats made the majority go horde?
[3:18:57] Utmost777: @ventu105 they are near the bottom of sims
[3:19:01] CoyoteKai: SERVERS UP
[3:19:04] EvoCyberNation: It doesn't matter, the player is dead :)
[3:19:07] Not_Serious: I often think about ramping back up to Mythic raiding level, but then I remember those long hours on fights from back in the day, and I think i'm ok with just doing Raid finder, then running M+ dungeons with friends.
[3:19:08] c0ldbloodead: People go horde because it's a meme at this point.
[3:19:09] EvoCyberNation: that's all that matters lol
[3:19:10] Molvonos: @CoyoteKai No. And shush
[3:19:11] Deathraid82: Troll racial
[3:19:14] Deathraid82: It was too strong
[3:19:16] steelreign0080: They can make ALL racials a choose/earnable through a chain so you can mix and match
[3:19:20] smashwow: horde = more players = more groups = more to do with groups because MMO
[3:19:20] Molvonos: Troll racial, orc racials
[3:19:28] DokSarbok: ofc it does lol
[3:19:29] Ballswagger: just play on a high pop ally server 4Head
[3:19:31] steelreign0080: alliance racials are terrible man
[3:19:32] Molvonos: tauren racials.
[3:19:33] DokSarbok: nerf horde buff ally
[3:19:43] bootybuttss: That was the entire reason people switched lol, horde racials were just better
[3:19:45] Molvonos: All the horde racials are vastly superior than Alliance.
[3:19:50] paulson14: hordes just straight up better then ally since the beginning
[3:19:54] IzacCS: they could make so Horde and alliance can raid together
[3:19:55] thiccsushi: if they offered free faction changes alliance would be dead 100%
[3:19:56] paulson14: all the best guilds played horde
[3:19:56] mobbo: A lot of people had gone horde because of racials
[3:19:59] Deathraid82: rocket boots giving the edge in actual raids
[3:20:00] xhaven: horde Racials was the problem tho, they need to rebalance the racials to make a first step
[3:20:00] Enzio_G: just buff ally and nerf horde 4Head
[3:20:00] coachingpotatoes: @Not_Serious, yeah i've thought about that with fps games, but the amount i would need to play to keep good level... no way
[3:20:01] nellko69: what are those red wings on his character?
[3:20:05] manmower: allies are the best pvp racials
[3:20:05] Ardailec: Only real solution is to just remove the problem entirely. End the segregation for PvE and PvP content.
[3:20:15] RyzuxTV: !ui
[3:20:15] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Check !Discord's pinned messages in the #cesspool channel for further installation details. Dont forget to make backups!
[3:20:15] EvoCyberNation: It's all horde
[3:20:28] xideontv: arenas is alliance dominated
[3:20:33] nimphtv: whole guilds would have to mass xfer over for it to change. individuals would never switch alone to mythic raid ally
[3:20:38] EvoCyberNation: well, not all but obvious 6/10 or 7/10 are horde
[3:20:39] coachingpotatoes: quin is all around the factions just getting all the benefits
[3:20:41] Kit300: horde just had more interesting factions on horde for to long.
[3:20:45] Clay2K_: @Towelliee do we know what the split is? is it only 55% vs 45%
[3:20:49] Ballswagger: as long as you dont play on a dead server it really doesnt matter for the player
[3:20:52] steelreign0080: He was also horde from the get go so not a dog in that fight
[3:20:52] smashwow: op racials back when WFR became popular did the damage. even if they're even now. population changed long ago. it'd take a massive inbalance to make people change
[3:21:04] manmower: if they put more content surrounding pvp, the faction balance might shift
[3:21:06] icedragonsapphire: hi chat, is there a chance the server will restart earlier?
[3:21:07] thiccsushi: @Clay2K_ for raiding population its like 70% horde 30% ally might be worse now
[3:21:11] OopsRyBad: top wow streamer is alliance, that's enough of a balance
[3:21:14] idenkaz_: you can not tell me that its balanced. cmon
[3:21:15] EvoCyberNation: They can't use dead people as a counter of horde vs alliance. lol
[3:21:16] IchabodCrain: and yet the alliance has a 30% wm buff?
[3:21:25] steelreign0080: according to sharding on my alli toon they are imbalanced lol
[3:21:29] MabusGaming: 11 pst
[3:21:30] nimphtv: 11
[3:21:32] thiccsushi: 11 pst
[3:21:33] Onearmyof2: 11
[3:21:36] Daggerstry: Do a Jebait racial increase and once the factions are matched, nerfbat it down
[3:21:36] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Trafikk_ (warning)
[3:21:37] Umoran: I started as alliance when i was a kid. when i grew up i went horde :P

[3:21:45] Deathraid82: what they are saying is they've for the most part fixed it but now the disparity between horde an alliance is already there. only way to change it is to offer free faction changes
[3:21:51] critin87: 11pst
[3:21:52] mobbo: 11 Pacific
[3:21:53] Eclyptz: What time does the one on EU start?
[3:21:58] Molvonos: @Daggerstry That won't help anyone, since hardcore raiders will just switch back.
[3:21:59] MabusGaming: lol
[3:22:11] Deathraid82: not all
[3:22:15] xluckydawgx: I just want my vault loot
[3:22:16] Romnus: I have been Alliance for life and just live with the fact that the horde is better at everything
[3:22:16] idenkaz_: what i think is that they are afraid of admitting what we all can see. dead faction.
[3:22:18] Trafikk_: the average WoW player gives absolutely no fuckers about raider io or Twitch :p
[3:22:22] smashwow: @Deathraid82 it would take more than that. why move for free when the population just isn't on the other side?
[3:22:36] ezainal: What’s your ping on EU?
[3:22:41] ramee_is_randys_dodo: Horde storyline is great... Alliance has a bitch ass uselss crybaby leader
[3:22:44] Deathraid82: if you are top end raiding guild. you don't have to worry about population
[3:22:45] saltpastillen: that would just result in more people going horde LUL
[3:22:46] Daggerstry: Can I survive another 3-4 hrs of maintenance?
[3:22:53] critin87: just let me login
[3:22:56] Frustrated_Nerd: HoJ
[3:22:58] fistofnature: just make night elves hotter and horde will lose all their blood elves LUL
[3:23:06] ExigentMidnight: That seems consistent with Blizzard's message from the last 5 years which is that the imbalance at the top end is because Alliance needs to try harder
[3:23:07] xhaven: @smashwow thats just it however the populations are mostly balanced except for a few servers
[3:23:12] Molvonos: My thing is, I like the aestetic of the horde, i like the storylines, I like the community more after 8+ years of Alliance.

[3:54:26] infinityinc: they ever nerfed assassination in pvp in anticipation of mass spec switches, lol
[3:54:31] vic_ave: there is a mount from the maw and one from torghast
[3:54:33] Staksor: nope, The Beastwarrens
[3:54:35] Onearmyof2: its a wild hunt
[3:54:35] suggartown: Celestial Guidance is the only one that is a consistent profit I've found.
[3:54:37] Staksor: not the Hold
[3:54:38] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Towelliee We gunna have the "Miracle" song for the FIRST Weekly Chest opening??? towJesus towJesus

[3:54:46] Onearmyof2: you need beast wardens
[3:54:53] excessior: its not the weekly chest anymore
[3:54:53] lilkenboneious: Gorged Shadehound chat is the maw mount. Have to have the beastwarrens unlocked at ambivilent
[3:54:54] mrniceguy817: Beastwardens
[3:54:56] Onearmyof2: warrens*
[3:55:04] Romnus: Dang I already have enough trouble on the disc priest on layer 6... now the mobs will take longer to kill :(
[3:55:07] Staksor: probably 1% as always
[3:55:08] The_Yonaz: JOR...no
[3:55:09] lufty89: @infinityinc lol never. assas so bad. 800 dps vs 2k
[3:55:10] Kinghorn: probably low
[3:55:11] BlueBlurPrime: beastwarrens
[3:55:19] Holysal: same as rustfeather
[3:55:25] filos0phia: can't you just get the mount by doing layer 8?
[3:55:27] drewthedude8: what how are you playing right now lol
[3:55:29] Stafunoob: gotta have the right hunt to pop up first
[3:55:30] greemteam: @romnus blizz is trying to force you to group
[3:55:36] lilkenboneious: Once a week from my understanding
[3:55:37] andrewbergeron: server list is back
[3:55:38] Gerr_x: the events are once per time you get rep
[3:55:40] duffluv22: Better than Sha, I hope
[3:55:44] idenkaz_: its on a rotation
[3:55:44] quakegoogl: catleeKOT
[3:55:49] shamsael: realmlist is up but servers down
[3:55:50] Onearmyof2: probably every day since its like the nzoth invasions
[3:55:50] spatuladogg: Didn't touch BfA due to life stuff. How does the new leveling system feel in terms of enjoyment doing quests?
[3:55:51] Seerated: If it's a Wild Hunt, I'd presume every time that specific hunt pops ?
[3:55:59] Gragnar: last time I did an event, it wasn't available the next day
[3:56:01] sinlesssinner: wait i saw vanguards with a shadowy dragon like mount? is there a boss that drops that? @Towelliee
[3:56:02] MOLAR305: 8 layers * 18 floors
[3:56:02] smilylol_: @Towelliee do you know what levels of tor is out this week
[3:56:06] Summage: The other event is weekly so i assume this one is also
[3:56:13] BlueBlurPrime: heard a 2 week rotation
[3:56:14] Romnus: @greemteam Yeah that makes sense. Right now I HATE going in with friends cause its easier by myself
[3:56:17] DaddyDrogonScaly: what wings are out this week
[3:56:17] Gragnar: wowhead does have a timer
[3:56:17] metavahn231: weapon enchants are already going for like 40 gold, that profession blows LUL
[3:56:21] Mafinky: !gfuel
[3:56:21] Moobot: Towelliee is sponsored by G FUEL! The official energy drink of ESPORTS and THE HAMMER SQUAD! towHAMUP Use code ➡ TOWEL ⬅ at checkout! gfuel.ly/3kf8stb
[3:56:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: "not easy". Laughs in Hunter Kappa 4Head
[3:56:23] basedpyramids: Should be easy with my guardian druid. Might take about 6 hours tho lol
[3:56:24] Ballavar: but if i group for torghast. its really fuckin hard. why would i do that as a tank
[3:56:28] kfm_badmagic: shouldi i wait to do world boss and some raids before opening my great vault?
[3:56:30] lilkenboneious: once a week every 2 weeks since its on rotation
[3:56:34] bakurathewolf: show mount?
[3:56:35] captain69: mythic raid will be open in na?
[3:56:36] Tiltedfeller: The game is up??
[3:56:37] wowmogo: Twisted Corridors is very class dependant (like most of torghast) - was able to do it all on Beta as prot paladin. But my DPS guildies struggle big time
[3:56:37] Staksor: @Seerated probably not. Wrath of the Jailer for example has a weekly loot lockout
[3:56:39] Clay2K_: @Towelliee is there a max layer lvl for torghast (non corridors)?
[3:56:41] mcqueenfiend: is sub rogue still good
[3:56:47] destiny25: wait are servers up??
[3:56:52] SabakuBlood: @Veramer depends on cserver, on my shit server they are going for 200-500g
[3:56:53] Kinghorn: or playing with friends towRage
[3:56:54] sinlesssinner: yes dont open the vault, til u do the weekly, world boss.
[3:56:55] Ballavar: makes sense
[3:56:57] Clay2K_: @destiny25 EU
[3:56:57] metavahn231: i switched from nightfae to kyrian and the anima power is WAY more overpowred, like wtf
[3:56:58] Staksor: @Seerated so I could imagine it's the same with the hunt
[3:56:58] BlueBlurPrime: just realm list
[3:57:03] Shiekrunner: yo towelliee from where is the exp weakaura
[3:57:04] shamsael: damn, how much should I charge for torghast carries?
[3:57:13] hughmongouspc: torghast is not hard if you pick the right buffs for any class which is the way it should be... I would agree they could buff for classes that heal a lot but for classes like warrior or rogue it would be tough if they buffed
[3:57:14] quakegoogl: towBook catleeCORN
[3:57:16] Amarlian: So you are saying I should run guardian vs feral in torghast
[3:57:17] jmr2015: yea thats what im saying lol
[3:57:17] Twigz_KC: !wa
[3:57:18] mmm_i_love_tamales: head shave? How much you got under that hat?

[3:57:19] FatChase: Imagine buying a carry for Torghast KEKW
[3:57:21] jmr2015: how much should i be making here
[3:57:21] Ballswagger: what classes are best to boost torghast?
[3:57:25] Boomgone: cant believe people are buying torgast carries....
[3:57:29] Kinghorn: 100000000% Amarlian
[3:57:31] Seerated: Alright @Staksor, probably like those then, haven't done many of those Jailer events
[3:57:35] zigzugg: servers list is up towPog
[3:57:40] infinityinc: have you seen the shaman anima powers and you wonder why?
[3:57:51] YoloSmokinDoloSolo: @spatuladogg easy to get into , and few catch up systems you can catch up within hours at max lvl if not the next day if u take your time
[3:57:54] Ballavar: antena is god
[3:57:55] thewillem: lightning dust OP
[3:57:56] Wcvechten: Corruption antenna is so broken lmao
[3:57:58] squirtncider: Torghast is easy but boring as fuck
[3:58:02] figurines: at the end of a torghast i was doing 20kdps on my MW
[3:58:03] steelreign0080: I always go non class buffs
[3:58:05] shamsael: the ones that proc bonus magic damage are good
[3:58:05] Amarlian: Might try it out @Kinghorn
[3:58:08] filos0phia: demonoly warlock in torghast is amazing lol
[3:58:12] IxProNoobxI: just level a Vengence DH and Torghast ez mode
[3:58:13] Utmost777: DPS that don't have pets are rough
[3:58:14] Dexter0908: rogues
[3:58:17] Summage: Fire Juggler
[3:58:18] Ballavar: 30% less magic dmg fora bear? ok
[3:58:18] infinityinc: I like the stealth one
[3:58:23] shamsael: if you just nuke the mobs, a lot of their attacks don't matter anymore
[3:58:24] Austei: i had my shammy at 55k hp and about 7k auto heal a sec was pretty funny
[3:58:26] Kinghorn: never do torghast on a dps solo unless you need to
[3:58:26] Vatali_Tia: how are mages in torghast
[3:58:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: 193 BM Hunter, 50k gold Torghast carry, Floors 1-6 Kappa Jebaited
[3:58:27] Gragnar: playing as Enhance, the totem builds are crazy good
[3:58:28] whitericedylan: demon hunter pretty easy
[3:58:28] Jarless: laughs in BM
[3:58:29] basedpyramids: being able to use the new mount in the Maw is game changing
[3:58:32] Boomgone: torgast is ez as mage
[3:58:34] lilkenboneious: Bonedust brew powerups on necro monk is OP.
[3:58:34] atlietv: u mean to tell me my whirlwind hitting 800 instead of 500 isnt good??
[3:58:34] smilylol_: Do we know which wings of torghast are up this week?
[3:58:35] CrimznR6: Was there in there as Blood and got the instant sac pact buff, and 25 sec cooldown minion.
[3:58:42] lufty89: literally impossible to solo on rogue
[3:58:44] CrimznR6: like 600 percent damage
[3:58:45] NVbrutal: yea some of those buffs are op lol got a 250k crit other day
[3:58:46] Steveennnnn: some class abalities are really crazzy, the vivify for monk is just stupid xD
[3:58:48] spatuladogg: @YoloSmokinDoloSolo Sweet. I'm thinking about binge playing in the coming weeks. Gotta that itch and the new XP looks fun.
[3:58:49] Yetik: Fury warrior = no way to finish a layer
[3:58:49] AxlTheBard: What do you mean non-class buffs?
[3:58:56] TheLucifer0g: on my prot warrior a got a buff that let me my shattering throw do 100000% damage on its first hit and with a bunch of damage buffs i one shotted the floor 6 boss
[3:58:57] Staksor: the one that gives you 30% main stat and you can't jump is the best Kreygasm
[3:58:58] mr_mistrix: At what lvl prot paladin gets Hammer of the Righteous ?
[3:58:58] Boomgone: @lufty89 plenty of rogues solo it lol
[3:58:59] infinityinc: CANNOT STACK 4 OF ANYTHING ANYMORE, LOLOLOL
[3:59:03] Chiphazzord: my demo lock crushes. I haven't even died yet. maybe 8's will hurt
[3:59:05] hughmongouspc: well for rogue there is one that increases combo generator dmg by 150% after a finisher which is insane especially with kyrian ability but it is glitched and goes away after a while :(
[3:59:08] kngkoopa: i got three shadow dmg antenea on my resto shaman, killed everything in seconds
[3:59:09] sinlesssinner: pet classes are best in torghast
[3:59:17] Ezekyler: fuck Entangling Roots anima powers for druids KEKW
[3:59:27] steelreign0080: esp the non class healing bufffs are crazy
[3:59:28] aeroplax: what if i struggle with both? LUL
[3:59:29] Yetik: Anima powers are really important true
[3:59:33] Ogerly: the real question is do you get to pick them or do you just crap class abillities the whole time?
[3:59:36] ArchetypeK6: on EU servers?
[3:59:37] CoyoteKai: "look for the powers" its RNG lmfao
[3:59:38] Raugdel: WeSmart
[3:59:39] metavahn231: monk corrosive mist is OP, always take that one, the heal that damages
[3:59:45] Faithinlight: FEk POlymorph powers for mage Sadge
[3:59:45] draculantula: i pick every power with boss in mind
[3:59:47] Staksor: but they also buffed those powers
[3:59:47] raldrik: they just need a save point. I cannot play it because I dont have that much time to sit and play all the floors. Not going to play an hour just to have it wiped out because the dog has to go out or something
[3:59:56] quakegoogl: towBeer ruyuF
[3:59:56] AxlTheBard: I just swapped to Warlock and can solo up to lvl 4 solo but, my gear is still pretty dogshit
[3:59:56] maxitophresh: honestly very good advice ty <3
[3:59:58] CardinalTX: with the right buffs I couldnt die on my Affliction lock
[3:59:58] chaoticaptain: nerfed Runecloth wrappings etc
[4:00:00] merzicdh: yes but they changed the percent they give you to be higher.
[4:00:01] quakegoogl: ruyu1
[4:00:01] ninjitsu124: this eu?
[4:00:03] Sultair: Always analyze your setup at floor 3 since you know what the boss is at that point. If its a tough boss you cant beat go boss build floor 4/5
[4:00:03] infinityinc: yes, they limited pretty much everything to 3
[4:00:06] steelreign0080: certain things stack limit changed.
[4:00:06] Ezekyler: yeah a lot of things are now max 3 stacks
[4:00:07] Utmost777: @Towelliee do you know if the holy poser in combat power is worth getting more than one of?
[4:00:07] lumaday: @ninjitsu124 yea
[4:00:07] Snatchinupyokids: they did a lot of changes where the initial value is much higher but you can stack it much less
[4:00:08] brotherzttv: arent servers down
[4:00:08] iamgraymane: Read the hotfixes from yesterday
[4:00:09] thegummibearmassacre: LULW
[4:00:11] wowmogo: @raldrik You can afk for 30 minutes
[4:00:12] Crazdmadman: yeah they nerfed the heck out of paladin anima powers
[4:00:17] Daggerstry: What's interesting is that even if you hit your cap of times you can get an anima power, it is still offered. And if you select it, you just lose a power
[4:00:17] irlock143: realm list are up
[4:00:18] jennagraces: @Veramer I had like 3-4 stacks last night as MW and holy crap it was ridiculous
[4:00:23] steelreign0080: I dont think all stack limits changed
[4:00:27] lumaday: 10min roughly a floor
[4:00:28] shamsael: 30 minutes per run for me
[4:00:30] Doug_Douglass: 40 minutes
[4:00:30] wwwyzzerd: 300% on my turtle shield is still good tho
[4:00:30] aliceuwu_x: Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[4:00:31] jason_tacey: not if your a healer
[4:00:33] Ballavar: its shorter than a raid night
[4:00:34] AjjtheDK: I can 1 shot a 5 pack of mobs with Blood Boil using the Mawrat kills increse damage anima power. @Towelliee so I agree
[4:00:38] Kiddeath77: yeah the pally one with 3 charges of lay on hands op as hell
[4:00:38] steelreign0080: 10 minutes a floor my ass
[4:00:39] shockvalew: spoken like a tank player
[4:00:40] jason_tacey: 1 hour sometimes longer
[4:00:42] sevens777s: @Towelliee more than an hour unless your one of the lucky ones that can solo
[4:00:43] kodtheog: Why did someone say we shouldn’t open our vaults til world boss drop? @towelliee
[4:00:44] Narcona: Depends on the anima power luck
[4:00:48] MikeyGy: why would anyone do all 6 flors if you can get all souls ash only from last one LuL
[4:00:49] lumaday: @chop0080 tank life bro
[4:00:50] raldrik: yeah takes me an hour
[4:00:52] whitericedylan: if i do it solo id rather not get attacked taking a break
[4:00:54] Nihilist_Verum: I think that was the previous week
[4:00:56] Daggerstry: Obtainable x times
[4:00:57] IxProNoobxI: IMO it should be account unlocked, if you have cleared 6 floors on 1 character you shouldn't have to go 1 by 1 on all your other characters
[4:00:59] smashwow: a layer takes roughly an hour on avg
[4:00:59] infinityinc: so I should do it as resto on my shaman? (just dinged, did level 3 last night as ele, doable but slow)
[4:00:59] vic_ave: depends on what powers you get
[4:01:03] ninjitsu124: i hope they decided to add a +10% to dhg instead of the 5 :)
[4:01:03] MMokuin: 10 min floor?.. are you speedruner? LUL
[4:01:07] wvivar: How is he playing? Aren’t servers down?
[4:01:08] twistedstick1: Some of us have small bladders and need a save point.
[4:01:08] duffluv22: Go to the last floor and get credit for all the floors underneath.
[4:01:12] ScrubMesz: So this might come as a weird question but from a raiders point of view is it worth to returning to shadowlands (stopped in leagion) ?
[4:01:15] KristineTheUnicorn: @wvivar EU
[4:01:16] CrownKloun: @wvivar my question exactly xD
[4:01:25] kodtheog: @scrubmesz yes its amazing
[4:01:26] vic_ave: he is on EQ
[4:01:26] Romnus: When I watch this stream I feel like i am trash at the game lol. It takes me at least an hour to clear layer 6 on a disc priest
[4:01:29] vic_ave: EU even
[4:01:29] Doctah_Jones: @CrownKloun Same question
[4:01:34] atlietv: 8 ads reeeeeee
[4:01:35] wvivar: Ohhh Lolol vpn at its finest.
[4:01:38] SuperHaxx: warriors can get endless phantasma with a common anima power
[4:01:41] Panadol324: All you need is the power : 1,5 min GOD mode nothing more need :D
[4:01:41] thewillem: That's because nobody at blizzard plays or understands monk
[4:01:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: They buffed HP and Damage of enemies on Floor 2,4 and 5 on "all" Floors. Have fun! LUL
[4:01:48] merzicdh: these ads come at the worst time
[4:01:50] JGussey: 7 ads its like twitch is counting down
[4:01:50] Steveennnnn: dont tell them dude
[4:01:57] ScrubMesz: @kaeod can you mby ellerborate why is it amazing is it beacuse of the system or ? :)
[4:01:58] smashwow: ssssssshhhhh
[4:02:01] Ballswagger: does torghast scale with ilvl?
[4:02:01] jennagraces: Excellent devoSIP
[4:02:04] Cidarr: Ssshhh you're not suppose to tell anyone about corrosive Towelliee
[4:02:06] infinityinc: @Romnus don't believe everything you read, most outside of the 1% will take 40mins+ to do layer 6
[4:02:09] wvivar: Roll out the ads get payed!!
[4:02:09] knicknack92: RWF?

[4:02:53] I_DoctorSatan_I: Be a sub, you wont have 7 ads LUL 4Head
[4:02:58] thewillem: when the brewmaster spamming heals on himself and doing nothing else is doing more dmg than the marksman, boomie, and shaman combined...that's hilarious
[4:03:03] hughmongouspc: 4 rogues in top 100 and they nerf TF out of them
[4:03:09] Gekiretsu: add 4 of 9, doesn't matter to me. sub to avoid them
[4:03:13] Elwhitemonkey: Elwhitemonkey subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[4:03:18] basedpyramids: server list is up so servers should be back soon
[4:03:19] NexLap: us server list is up
[4:03:20] MOLAR305: new tmog set?
[4:03:23] A_P_P_L_E_S: should be "up" in 13 minutes
[4:03:35] majorizc: the servers are up?
[4:03:44] sinlesssinner: thats what she sadi
[4:03:45] AHeroicPanda: The realm status page only reflects if they actual servers are up - that doesn't necessarily mean they can be logged into.
[4:03:46] sinlesssinner: said
[4:03:49] ch0ller: Kreygasm
[4:03:52] hiimbryanp: Does threads of fate work across factions?
[4:03:55] mo197: giggity

[4:04:32] Hugveldt: Method HeyGuys
[4:04:38] Staksor: you think Echo players will have the same amount of breaks as they had with Method? 🤔
[4:04:55] Mockle: what time is the race?
[4:04:57] robbed247: What map addon are you using to see all that stuff?
[4:05:03] jak_gaming: that is a gangster shield
[4:05:04] zgag: Bnet now showing servers. Just not up yet
[4:05:12] borgking82: @Towelliee how long for 1st mythic boss kill do you think ?
[4:05:13] smashwow: @Staksor probably because the strat dudes are the same. the problem was the length though.

[5:01:22] Rastaballin: its funny how we all give blizzard so much time every reset to implement a change for a game that we pay monthly for like its normal. If your internet went out every Tuesday i bet you would be pissed.

[5:02:52] Its_Immanis: They'll tell you the maintenance times are factored into the subscription fee and tell you to pound sand.
[5:02:54] Masqerader: give them a week of game time then ban them for a week
[5:02:55] irakem: its easier and cheaper to give a free week gametime than handle customercomplaints
[5:03:03] Amarlian: This game is 16 years old, downtime is not new. Hell, it's not new for any MMO since some of the first ones.
[5:03:06] MetallicusGaming: Pandemic going on and ppl complaining about they can't play WoW for a few hours, go read a book or something LUL

[5:04:05] himynameisalex5: It's actually pretty impressive how stable their servers are (aside from release day madness)
[5:04:05] jason_tacey: Ask Ion for that refund on downtime, I wanna hear him laugh...
[5:04:06] mewsicall: you basically only rent your account
[5:04:14] towellieeesboy: Blizzard can't even pay for customer service reps, you think they have server engineers??
[5:04:15] mewsicall: lol yeah
[5:04:15] critin87: stop crying plz
[5:04:20] critin87: BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[5:04:22] Amarlian: I remember Asheron's Call they had to take down the servers so the Devs could run through the zones and loot corpses to clear up ground space @Towelliee
[5:04:23] Panadol324: watch South Park episode with apple , you will know what is there :D :D
[5:04:45] Masqerader: the eula probably has some agreement where u sell your soul and sign over your first born to blizzard, who got time to read through all that

[5:05:06] aikopooh: so we renting pixels for 15$ for a month ouch lol
[5:05:21] Deyo0: just that you can't kill world boss alone lol
[5:05:22] waterboy821: What world boss is it going to be?
[5:05:23] Blvdman: True story, I complained in BFA about finishing an M+ just before reset and getting a ring, and then getting the same ring in my weekly chest. Asked customer support for a conch. Got the hookup the following week :)
[5:05:23] Siddie: So you gonna solo that world boss then? 🤣
[5:05:30] smoke1x2knight: we get the covenant hearthstone this week?
[5:05:30] Clicklesly: Doin WB first also means you can choose Vault better (if you don't have all 220 items that is ^^)
[5:05:30] towellieeesboy: Servers down all day Tuesday is inexcusable bc they already require us to do 10+ hours of Torghast on alts
[5:05:35] SpyCrabbo: also you might get an upgrade from the world boss, which might affect your pick from the vault
[5:05:40] Kinghorn: prot paladins can solo anything
[5:05:54] Sincline387: I DESERVE A DISCOUNT FOR DOWN TIME!!!!....if you think that you may want to rethink playing as your worrying way to much for nickles and dimes.

[6:56:11] josh8555: I just got my rogue to 49 last night and it let me start Shadowlands

[6:57:33] thebakeriscomingforu: kyrian ability is so good.
[6:57:39] Wulfgrym: it says to do mythic 0s
[6:57:53] whitechalklate: @redtemplar88 if that's the case then they worded that blue text post very weirdly in explaining it
[6:57:59] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[6:58:00] brucezhu: @Towelliee I decided to switch my main from BDK to bear tank. BDK is not too bad for raid but overwhelmingly tiring when playing m+'s. Have to time cooldowns on every pull so that I'm not oneshoted. Plus my healer in guild does not like healing a BDK lol.

[7:14:05] RiptoreCA: or 10%
[7:14:07] filos0phia: Scarra is a good example of someone who was extremely successful, let himself decline, then decided to be successful again and pulls 10k avg viewers within a year
[7:14:10] drunkermonk: Blizzard somehow knew my work connection would be down today and i'd have free time to play...FML

[7:14:16] Gnral: classic*
[7:14:18] FunkySkunkyTV: the problem nowadays is you got streamers that bitch and whine about not getting views when theyve been streaming for like 6 months..... you still got 2 more years of hard work minimum kid. minimum. Suck it up
[7:14:21] filos0phia: if you know how to do it, you can do it whenever you need to

[7:15:31] Slitze: was that zap?
[7:15:41] filos0phia: @brickskwuadd Scarra says he doesn't make good money cause he's comparing himself to Tim or Poki. Not because he's unsuccessful

[7:24:52] jonboigg: Private sessions
[7:24:57] Phoxzy: Yeah, but you might want to look in to nano-cbd, it bypasses the liver. So much better. I was diagnosed with liver disease so Ive done my homework.
[7:24:59] MouthyNinja: big true
[7:25:01] crashoverride_gaming: Yeah when you get older, water is crucial before you go to bed and the day after after hard drinking
[7:25:02] Dionaut: Want a good work out, get high then go work out. Legit some of the best workouts ive ever had.
[7:25:04] gfield2k: Yeah same here with our Crunch. They were even fined 5k. @Towelliee
[7:25:05] nihav: I think Comp/Limit GM not actually playing the game but still giving them instructions is equivalent to cheating. He doesnt have to worry about things like game mechanics and situational awareness like an actual raider has to. So even if they do win this race, it will be with a 21 man roster.

[7:25:56] KillaPr0: i see a lot of people not wearing a mask
[7:26:04] terryble_gaming: did you say VEGAS!?!?
[7:26:06] MouthyNinja: @nihav it doesn't matter. They can have 20 people telling them what to do. they have to actually do it
[7:26:07] raldrik: lock up that twitch exclusive money :)
[7:26:08] Vigi9413: did they extend maint? I thought it was 6-11

[7:26:43] brucezhu: I just hope people can take vaccine when it's available. Vaccine will be much less effective if many people just don't take it.

[7:26:49] twistedstick1: sock on head black out.
