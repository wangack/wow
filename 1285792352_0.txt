[0:50:13] shaddyz: Someone made the math, 40% increased quest XP only turns out to be 16% faster than in classic, because you spend so much time killing mobs and traveling between mobs. So 100% quest XP might not be as much as we think.
[0:50:20] purpledrank210: Did Blizz announce server transfers for SoM?
[0:50:48] SidecarShrimp: @shaddyz Yeah i saw Staysafe do that math

[0:51:05] Gonamek: is blizzard planning to implement xp boost?
[0:51:15] TheEndIsNear777: if 40% is 16% faster, then 100% is 40% faster
[0:51:31] shaddyz: Yea something like that @TheEndIsNear777
[0:51:35] ForsakenTV3: he did and bang hasn't been seen all week lol

[1:20:00] NOHITJEROME: That's 100% true, the content being more difficult doesn't make people want to play more LUL
[1:20:02] Enmael00: sure... first boss is easy i  just 1 shotted the boss and turn water to wine
[1:20:02] RealRobD: I'm out of the loop, WTH is SOM? For what game?

[1:21:44] Bewildfire: Dead server = no flasks for MC
[1:21:45] Exnihilo77: People probably had lack of add ones too like dispelling
[1:21:48] shaddyz: @JayVeenn You havent done it thats for sure. Its not just a numbersgame, its mechanics now that you gotta watch out for. Thats why melee is so "bad" now, you gotta keep moving all the time.
[1:21:55] NOHITJEROME: I was trying to set up the IRL phone cam you have, it's not easy :)
[1:22:01] pwnstarqt: That's like one of my favorite mage pvp moves. Full sheep into cya enjoy
[1:22:03] oldcauliflower: I remember the name Swifty back then also. So Swifty and I have been around for awhile.

[1:23:11] Exnihilo77: That first boss requires a ton of dispelling so if they don’t have decursive add on it could be rough
[1:23:20] Enmael00: i doubt it... you have "streamer privelleges
[1:23:24] oldcauliflower: Swifty was here for like WoW player 1 long long time ago.

[3:29:49] Turkikaboha: How come my 49 ele twink does 1400 chain lighting
[3:29:49] davy121111: @Turkikaboha because spell power affects spells based on the cast speed of the spell, because chain lightning has a high cast speed, it doesnt benefit much from spell power at all, so your chain lightning is only slightly weaker than swifts one
