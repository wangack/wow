[5:20:01] ghostfables: when you have a Link macc its not hard to hit it that fast (roughly) when you're a pro because you're expecting it to come out depending on defensives/trinkets remaining . they just read the play. predicted it

[5:20:27] Poplockz101: the mana difference tho D:
[5:20:30] grethedren: We don't like totem stomping macros. Destroying a totem should be a choice and require at least a modicum of player attention. That is one of the main differences between totems and other types of spells and we don't want everyone to just opt out of that difference.

[5:21:45] baldeyx: @Niski441 i am r1 and pride myself on being pretty good at killing links within a global. It should never be possible to kill a link before it lands. Like it's inhuman reaction time
[5:21:45] DoYouSeeOk: this chat is something
[5:21:46] jenny_yellow: @cheevzzz insane
[5:21:52] dmgcurry: killing link before it ticks happens alot in high rated shuffs or 3s...
[5:21:57] cogswolds: LUL Chat the faster way to counter link totem is to kill all of the players on the enemy team. Not that hard
[5:22:00] Ultramagnus85: I guess Wizk is just really really good guys wow the way he instantly gets it everytime
[5:22:00] TheMysticBean: @maxx_wow It wasnt on purpose lol, he meant to death sami, liquid actually got lucky if that death landed on sam he's probs dead

[5:22:11] Lixoga: @baldeyx yeah it's not possible, something's up but nothing will happen
[5:22:11] milcah_us_illidan: I didn't say he was cheating I said cheating poisons the well
[5:22:13] dankers7: @Lixoga you know he can just make a macro and spam it because he saw sam at 5% hp and he was clearly gonna get linked right?
[5:22:17] Yonyret: Give ret MS + Heroic Leap

[5:22:33] zinisterzz: @domoifyy if you watch the replay you can see that it did link to sam it just never linked to anyone else cause cdedw was late getting in.  Stop drawing conclusions from your flawed info.  Watch behind the bear before the camera turns when you can see the death
