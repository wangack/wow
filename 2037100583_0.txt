[1:05:34] bielich132: @MoonBlastx prio dmg specs always say others are padding. but somehow small adds still gotta die :D
[1:05:45] jonathanlii: mm is the lowest simming single target dps in the game lol
[1:06:01] Fuzziew: BM actually has pretty good prio damage. Why are people sleeping on BM's dam?
[1:06:14] kobe53: BM is just too squish
[1:06:15] ToastyMufn: Gingi how old are you, dont go non verbal on me
[1:06:25] gAbbAsHoW: @kobe53 proof
[1:06:38] blizzardpolice69: fortnite battle royale….
[1:06:40] MoonBlastx: @bielich132 It's because prio dps makes the key made in time not overall damage
[1:06:41] Fuzziew: Yeah BM survivability is lackluster for sure
[1:06:46] daevyfan: @kobe53 thats fine for low keys
[1:06:51] gAbbAsHoW: @Fuzziew proof pls

[1:09:26] Kedor2k: @sumoelfe an exception does not disprove the rule
[1:09:26] kobe53: cant compare hunter with mage on survivability
[1:09:30] nerefwow: I remember hopeful running shimmer on this fight classic
[1:09:41] gAbbAsHoW: @Kedor2k what rule? lmao
[1:09:46] Voxdom: Yup and I play hunter too so... thorns hurt a lot!
[1:09:50] johnswordttv: @shatter1234 , I believe 23s then they’ll go as high as they can for points
[1:09:57] lilchan921: @shatter1234 would assume 24-26 highes keys are around the 30 mark atm
[1:10:03] Kedor2k: The rule concerning hunters being awful compared to other classes
[1:10:10] beamishhhhh: @johnswordttv bro it’s time trials not tgp
[1:10:16] grimleeeper: is leech on hunter useful or better for avoidance?
[1:10:18] Fuzziew: @gAbbAsHoW There ya go lol. 2 in a row

[1:10:56] abusted: ya who doesnt run a mage here... lol :P
[1:11:02] blizzardpolice69: dh can rotate the tank spanks with fel dev and use soul cleave spam to spam spikes when capped on fury
[1:11:06] kobe53: @Purrfektly as i wrote, from +26 they start to struggle.  and on tyra u will notice it. can argue with that
[1:11:06] Shreddermus: You can feign so it doens't go on you
[1:11:08] MoonBlastx: @grimleeeper if you don't take 1 shot for the mechanics, leech is better
[1:11:11] blizzardpolice69: but if you mess that up you’re dead
[1:12:21] batu_x96: which build u play gingi
[1:12:29] kwlski01: doing afflicted at the wrong time people Deadge
[1:12:48] Kedor2k: @gAbbAsHoW Look at the statistics. Why do you care so much? Its not like you will be completing 30's anyway - play what you want
[1:13:09] gAbbAsHoW: looks like you are caring so much for the opposite to be true
[1:13:39] miiloswow: @Shreddermus  it still goes on you if you feign, its happened a few times to me :(

[3:25:18] blizzardpolice69: eating that ignite
[3:25:57] princeofcake: after these last couple of years do legion instances feel easier than df instances in m+ mechanics wise
[3:26:02] PromiscuousToilet: they should do MDI but only non-meta specs.
[3:26:20] psn_ikingoflag: might as well have 3 tanks
[3:26:28] psn_ikingoflag: wheres the dps lmao
[3:26:32] DemonTatjik: @PromiscuousToilet how would you define who is meta and who is not]
[3:26:34] GorieI: @princeofcake I'd say it kinda depends on the dungeon but trash mechanics I think are overall easier
[3:26:34] chasen218: clickz trolling
[3:26:55] PromiscuousToilet: @DemonTatjik raider io stats track it. every season theres some sort of off meta push thing. I forgot the name of it
[3:27:00] DemonTatjik: noone wants demo locks in high keys, but best m+ lock Rasl says demo is meta
[3:27:09] DemonTatjik: for example
[3:27:13] DemonTatjik: so is it meta or not?
[3:27:17] princeofcake: @GorieI gotcha
[3:27:17] chasen218: was he really 600k ?

[3:27:18] Lee_mes: "single target" :D
[3:27:36] PromiscuousToilet: meta is mostly based on popularity. not what the top end teams ruin
[3:28:04] PromiscuousToilet: run*
[3:28:17] Niv1era: @PromiscuousToilet You are wrong as fck
[3:28:19] Exorcist_PG: KEKW everyone is joking while mike is serious
[3:29:32] PromiscuousToilet: @Niv1era tf you talking about? how do you think a "meta" is set lmao
[3:29:44] BakedAlmonds: is monk zaelia?
[3:29:52] Exorcist_PG: yep
[3:30:14] PromiscuousToilet: @Niv1era meta= most popular. most effective. what the top teams run and what is realistic for the other 99.5% of the playerbase arent always the same
[3:30:28] SwifterSands: In essence, a "meta" in gaming terminology is a generally agreed upon strategy by the community. Said strategy is considered to be the most optimal way to win/ has the best performance at a specific task. Some people have defined meta as an acronym meaning “most effective tactics available”.
[3:30:36] mieko29: KEKW this group
[3:30:48] musfar2: @PromiscuousToilet exactly what he said?
[3:30:56] Niv1era: @PromiscuousToilet People run classes they see in TOp teams, not exact comp, but classes
[3:30:59] PromiscuousToilet: @Niv1era ill give you an example. s1 feral was used by top teams but it wasnt "meta"
[3:31:03] psn_ikingoflag: is MDI subs a thing, like 63rd minute they sub in kush?
[3:31:04] Radsol54: @PromiscuousToilet the 99.5% of the player base arent trendsetters bro, most of us are monkey see monkey do. therefore we follow what works for the meta setters (the best players)
[3:31:24] chasen218: hey question , who is this streamer 1st time here , is he kush that every 1 talks about ?
[3:31:43] ScapeeJ: @promiscuoustoilet MDI is different then highest keys. Feral was only an mdi choice not highest key push choice
[3:32:13] PromiscuousToilet: @ScapeeJ exactly. regardless your argument, it wasnt "meta' but mdi used it
[3:32:13] ScapeeJ: Feral was mdi meta. Not highest key push meta
[3:32:14] mr__pear: @chasen218 yep, gingi aka kush
[3:32:22] bubble938: !wa
[3:32:42] Niv1era: @PromiscuousToilet MDI and High keys have nothing in common)
[3:33:13] PromiscuousToilet: @Niv1era mdi is more realistic for meta than high keys. how many random pugs are doing high 20+ keys?
[3:33:32] minat0cs: PogChamp
[3:33:34] Niv1era: @PromiscuousToilet 20 arent even close to high keys mate)
[3:33:40] ScapeeJ: @promiscuoustoilet How many random pugs are pulling the same size as mdi teams?
[3:33:42] musfar2: @PromiscuousToilet 20+ is not high
[3:34:10] Radsol54: 20 is the new 15
[3:34:15] Radsol54: straight up
[3:34:17] jonasnielsen20: true
[3:34:33] PromiscuousToilet: i didnt say 20+ i said high 20+. i should have added an "s". how many random pugs are doing high +20s+ keys
[3:34:34] Moobot: A few spots have opened up for my Winter Fitness Program. Read more here https://bit.ly/4aVJKsn if you'd like to get in shape before summer! 😎
[3:34:45] miiloswow: i think he meant like high 20 keys, not 20 keys are high lol
[3:34:55] PromiscuousToilet: @miiloswow thank you lmao
[3:35:22] PromiscuousToilet: like how can you mistake "high +20" for me saying 20 is high? 20 is a singular level
[3:35:23] Radsol54: 5+ keys are hard bro

[3:35:24] miiloswow: @PromiscuousToilet  yup, common sense aint too common these days
[3:35:26] Radsol54: by 5+ i mean 28s
[3:35:28] Radsol54: lmfao
[3:35:37] Exorcist_PG: +5s are insanely hard wdym chat
[3:35:52] Radsol54: nah its not common sense, he just made an confusing statement
[3:35:58] weezull: it is common sense
[3:36:09] PromiscuousToilet: Either way. I started by responding to @Niv1era saying i was wrong when i said meta is the most popular played specs and they disagreed
[3:36:27] hi_itsdave: chat is rattled rn
[3:36:30] miiloswow: @Radsol54 ok maybe youre right, but i understood what he meant and im not the brightest
[3:36:41] gdtomii: wasnt a confusing statement
[3:36:57] madstepz: isnt 26 low key ?
[3:37:21] princeofcake: @PromiscuousToilet didnt he correct you because you said top players dont dictate the meta
[3:37:33] hi_itsdave: “high key” is subjective but it’s probably like 28 or 29+
[3:37:33] Moobot: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[3:37:43] Niv1era: @princeofcake i did
[3:37:50] asso4: Why no agumention? for dps?
[3:37:56] chasen218: is gingi getting old ?
[3:37:56] hi_itsdave: for most of the community that is
[3:38:00] PromiscuousToilet: @princeofcake i dont think they outright do dictate the meta on their own.
[3:38:02] Radsol54: keys have difficulty around 23-24, before that, its monkey easy
[3:38:03] GorieI: @hi_itsdave bro 28 29 are way higher than just "high"
[3:38:13] lyndira: @asso4 Meeres not playing Aug afaik
[3:38:18] ScapeeJ: @promiscuoustoilet What dictates the meta?
[3:38:29] lyndira: @Radsol54 24 is ez af
[3:38:30] Radsol54: 25+ is where i would say it gets 'hard' i.e needing real coordination and potentially voice
[3:38:35] PromiscuousToilet: @ScapeeJ i literally just said "on their own" as in its more than just high rated players dictating meta
[3:38:43] Radsol54: depending on which key
[3:39:01] peajay81: the talk about death in key and sad music :D
[3:39:04] princeofcake: @PromiscuousToilet okay why not? what other source dictates the meta
[3:39:09] ScapeeJ: @promiscuoustoilet So what is taken into the meta composition?
[3:39:12] GooberNE: @Radsol54 "how many random pugs are doing high 20+ keys?" is not a confusing statement xdd
[3:39:32] Radsol54: @Radsol54 it is when he didn't even mean 20-24 keys
[3:39:32] gdtomii: Chatting
[3:39:46] gdtomii: "high"
[3:39:53] Radsol54: saying 20+ indicates +20-30, and there is a grand canyon of difference between 20, 25, and 29-30
[3:40:04] Radsol54: its misleading if he means 25+ when he said 20+
[3:40:08] Efflosh: You playing ignite or flamestrike?
[3:40:18] GooberNE: He'd say mid +20 if he meant +25
[3:40:23] Radsol54: ^
[3:40:26] PromiscuousToilet: @SCAFatPanda popularity
[3:40:36] jaco163: one frost key?
[3:40:39] GooberNE: you're just dumb bro haha
[3:40:41] weezull: 20s are a range, from 20-29, high 20 means the upper end of the range, this is standard in english
[3:40:44] PromiscuousToilet: last season, ret pally was NOT part of break the meta. when did anyone see ret being consistently played by the top teams?

[3:42:06] tntqt96: Competition getting harder bro!
[3:42:08] Thoreya: 180k for u in 6 tourneys
[3:42:09] jonasnielsen20: @kawideter MDI is about being fast, and u lose damage with aug, hence u will be slower, so aug probably not the move for mdi
[3:42:10] Thoreya: must be nice

[4:38:08] gambleragain: @dalqie you're missing the part of getting better comes at the cost of deaths
[4:38:16] R3Fl3xIllI: @gergrunt not true
[4:38:16] gdtomii: the game has 1000's of ways to get gold
[4:38:17] rathox97: @phantom0803 also it already costs real money to play monthly LuL
[4:38:18] SCxFaytal: it is solid regen though i make almost 20k each world quest reset takes like 20 minutes
[4:38:37] Hurbob14: this guy really tries to argue that you can’t become better because you’re gold gated
[4:38:38] drumminbacon: @phantom0803 there's plenty of game currency generation.

[4:39:34] Thoreya: ppl still shocked that mmos have shops in them

[4:40:39] dalqie: imagine being so bad at the game that you still need to pay for the sub instead of doing it with tokens lmao
[4:40:41] TimeamM: I am not playing MD on my hunter =)
[4:40:42] Hurbob14: just commit one day a month to making gold and you can die as much as you want

[4:42:22] SCxFaytal: and it takes 30s to do
[4:42:25] SCxFaytal: lol
[4:42:32] Dreamz66: @kerdnej imagine paying subscription to the game and then buying ingame resources KEKW
[4:42:34] phantom0803: @gdtomii could you imagine paying for a game that you have to farm like a job to play its end game content.....
[4:42:34] R3Fl3xIllI: @SCxFaytal 5 deaths then
[4:42:55] Thoreya: 2 hours of doing stuff to make gold = farm like a job
[4:42:59] gdtomii: @phantom0803 "farm like a job" KEKL
[4:43:01] Thoreya: ppl just like to put blame on others
[4:43:12] SCxFaytal: ppl lazy
[4:43:24] gergrunt: playing the game organically gets you more than enough gold to do end game.

[4:47:23] MercurysNor: Last day TGP > MDI > TGP
[4:47:32] SethSteckler: TGP
[4:47:32] gergrunt: TGP
[4:47:48] gambleragain: @MercurysNor quite accurate
[4:48:06] Jerassus: @DadBodGeoff it's kind of a bad question, people like different things, all could like TGP but you like MDI more, so the question is quite invalid :)
[4:48:07] SethSteckler: i preferred MDI Last Stand format instead of the h2h format
[4:48:12] gambleragain: tgp lacks on the first 2 days

[4:59:27] WillWonkaa: @thekawaiiestbaka The blast midfight

[5:16:53] AbieCherry: double shadowflame
[5:16:55] EmilBaand: shadowflame Good for prio
[5:17:01] ItzSpudicuzz: patch with toxic boots
[5:17:12] Asgaard89: Probably bloodelf in order to have 1% more crit?
[5:17:15] AbieCherry: kush plays double BSL as sub @GingiTV
[5:17:16] titoiii84: OhMyDog
[5:17:27] JanDeGrote1: no shot shadowflame does more then toxic boots?
[5:17:29] monkeylol__: BSL in bis in m+
[5:17:31] treesdesu: !song
[5:17:32] EmilBaand: double shadow worse overall but prio + st i Think
[5:17:36] nastye: nope, shadowflame so you can have more vers (toxic boots have no vers)
[5:17:39] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi

[5:17:45] fitzysfps: on outlaw
[5:17:45] happirogue0: no double shadowflame is good because prio st in m+
[5:17:45] boiben_: Yep, because of the stats on the boots sucks. They play shadowflame for crit vers, is 0.5 behind toxic boots
[5:17:51] xoliathe: no way outlaw keys?!
[5:17:57] iamzdar: it should be between toxified + boots (either toxic or slimy, for me slimy sims better)
[5:17:58] OnlyDk: toxic boost got haste
[5:18:11] fitzysfps: yes
[5:18:18] happirogue0: you can do double bsl but its barely a 0.5% increase on double shadowflame. for keys
[5:18:29] dinnerfirst: @quzulu thorn is less stam, and single target
[5:18:36] witty95: can u explain how to tank yazma correctly

[5:19:04] monkeylol__: @GingiTV full minmax 2x BSL is bis in m+ its 0,5% better than 2x shadowflame which is the second best
[5:19:17] ExCodix: jpc doesnt use thorns... not sure why
[5:19:17] mogg_chill: 1.3 m for socket that you can get from  vault too :P

[6:24:01] buffmeister69: What addon shows the enchants and ilvl on each piece of gear like that in the character screen ?
[6:24:01] zerossussy: cloak is only catalyst or crafted otherwise its troll
[6:24:11] chaosfangx: @MeeresTV 484 ilvl this insane farm
[6:24:33] dom_1849: i say cloak due to stat weight
[6:24:38] itsnucho: How does shadowflame crafted differ from the normal crafted gear?
[6:24:42] zerossussy: craft belt+boots and engi wrist, BoE helm is the endgame bis if u want that
[6:24:45] dom_1849: and you can't socket cloak

[6:30:24] Ciqq: But set your spellqueuewindow short enough, otherwise you sometimes cast bte when your character is out of stealth on the server, but was still in stealth on your client
[6:30:30] deftmetal: is there away to see what wa he uses?
[6:30:42] jonathanhades: @Ciqq ty mate
[6:30:48] Ciqq: alternatively, put bte on the same button in your stealth bar as you have dispatch on your non-stealth bar
[6:31:31] Ciqq: Can do the same with sinister strike and ambush btw

[6:32:16] Dexyan: @ciqq how do you change the spellqueuewindow ? always happen to me I press on bte when I am on stealth but counts when I am not !
[6:32:17] N00B_L0RD: mods?
[6:32:21] polylino: the macro is badge. stance swap delay is a thing
[6:32:27] Luumpi: hate when that happen you enter wrong hole KEKW
[6:32:30] nimraizor: any keypushing tonight?

[6:33:01] Reiven_____: he has but if you distract you can pass with stealth
[6:33:17] LaxxasGG: this is the MDI squad?
[6:33:20] Dexyan: @ciqq do you have a number I should put plz ? thanks !
[6:33:31] LaxxasGG: @chat
[6:33:51] polylino: the only reason ss/ambush macro is fine is because you don't cast it immediately after vanish. if you use it for dispatch/bte you'll cast dispatch instead of bte after vanish if you're pressing it fast enough.
[6:33:52] Ciqq: @Dexyan Default is 400, lower it by 50 until it stops happening. Too low and your game feels clunky.
[6:33:59] polylino: stance swap delay is a real thing
[6:34:03] Dexyan: okay thanks !!
[6:34:47] stefkour: when is the mdi?
[6:34:55] Ciqq: @polylino i'm slower than a dead camel, haven't had it happen yet
[6:35:12] ipvpinside: is party fames part of the sub UI?
[6:35:21] polylino: @Ciqq lol that's fair. but should let people know the drawbacks before recommending imo o7

[6:37:39] Pjablo2904: Thx :)
[6:37:42] vmewo: or vice versa itll make you cast dispatch as your first global in stealth instead of bte
[6:38:29] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Gingi and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[6:38:45] Ciqq: @vmewo yea but that's better than pressing BtE when you're not in stealth yet and putting it on CD right as you start your crackshot window
[6:38:45] Moobot: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[6:39:35] vmewo: @Ciqq well yeah but youll never be able to do your stealth windows properly with the macro. You will waste first and last gcd
[6:39:55] peaceonearthx: mdi squad over?
[6:40:09] Ciqq: @vmewo Well you just wait for the stance delay when pushing the macro as you would wait with pusing BtE no?
[6:40:37] Ciqq: Or do you mean that without the macro stance delay you can hit BtE natty right as you stealth?
[6:40:46] vmewo: @Ciqq No, without the macro you can get potentially one more bte inside of the stealth window than without the macro
[6:40:53] vmewo: the macro takes some time to swap over when you enter stealth
[6:40:58] vmewo: so your first button press will be a dispatch instead of a bte
[6:40:59] Ciqq: I see I see, good info

[6:44:52] vmewo: @mavelolx in dps or rotationally?
[6:45:02] Dexyan: it’s good
[6:45:13] castlecastles: @vmewo i kinda just gave up and use mythic dream carver and the claw
[6:45:19] mavelolx: @vmewo dps

[6:47:25] vmewo: Dont use that macro @GingiTV the stance delay will make your BtE go on cd at the end of the window and it will make you use dispatch instead of bte at the start of the window
[6:47:50] behesse94: @vmewo Yes be careful with macros with bte
[6:47:56] yuunntw: Gingirogue POGGERS

[6:48:19] shibulinchen: oh oh i see a lot of bte cooldowns incoming
[6:48:20] vmewo: @Nationh1 it attempts to detect stealth stance but theres a delay in stance detection
[6:48:35] vmewo: @shibulinchen LUL yeah my bet is he takes this macro off mid key next run lol
[6:48:43] tankeern: is bte ever supposed to go on cd?
[6:48:44] miraagex: between the YEP
[6:48:51] shibulinchen: @vmewo hahaha yeah LUL
[6:49:07] vmewo: @tankeern only if your vanish is >45s cd and dance is >12s cd then you use it outside of crackshot window
[6:49:09] vmewo: otherwise no
[6:49:10] behesse94: Also I heard that if you macro BtE with GS it can sometimes cancel your subterfuge
[6:49:13] Nationh1: what the macro doing?
[6:49:20] BarubladeDE: i have 19 Fall and can trade dagger
[6:49:32] vmewo: @blackshad0w2wouish that wont cause it but macroing trinkets will yes

[6:50:29] miraagex: shaman solo carry afflicted EZ
[6:50:32] vmewo: @shibulinchen nope cuz theyre affected the same technically. Only change would be to dance and thats just a rule of thumb its hard to predict when is the 'safe" time to do it before dance cd
[6:50:36] Xenttras: 470 ?
[6:50:38] curative_wig: The daggers should drop now xD
[6:50:40] vmewo: but vanish and bte are equally affected by cdr

[7:13:48] injos: So 1 for BTE and a macro for BTE/Distpatch
[7:13:56] bardabrax: @gingitv don't forget to get dps pots you have none left in bags
[7:14:06] gonzobone: according to someone in chat your first global in stealth is dispatch and not BTE
