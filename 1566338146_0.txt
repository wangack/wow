[1:37:01] Sielu11628: It's basically just teleport to Waking Shores for now.
[1:37:08] Sielu11628: I'm excited to see what the intro experience is.
[1:37:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: During the reveal, they said people can PvP on the boats to the Dragon Isles, but I'm not sure that is a good idea LUL
[1:37:54] warmicecreamz: yo
[1:37:56] Zuralani: i think they said right off the boat since they land next to each other, but yeah it will be a blood bath with WM on
[1:38:25] Molvonos: Ah, my favorite store: Blood Bath & Beyond
[1:38:27] newkingcody: that just means alliance will be outnumbered 10 to 1 and slaughtered

[2:18:06] andrewmb01: @zenFX_ if that's true which I dont' believe it is your saying the expansion with the highest population was a failure.. nice logic lol
[2:18:09] Lostdogal: 20 hours would be fine if I could just click my alts and make them max lvl instantly. otherwise shorter is better

[3:02:17] BuzzCutBronson: Wait have they already got the whole 60-70 story complete
[3:02:33] TheCliffyShow: Wrathion can't really use the heir reason, anyway. Deathwing isn't actually his father. He is the father of Sabellion, and maybe Ebyssian.

[3:12:43] Rowini30: it's all about streamer-chat interaction
[3:12:43] SlickRick2013: if i have a TBC character, does it transfer over to Wrath, or when wrath hits you start all over

[3:13:01] Brodih_: i wish the platform could go back to being a gaming meta
[3:13:07] noneevo: MindManners
[3:13:14] zgag: The react meta allows for prolonged streams. Streamer watches a 20 min video that can be dragged out for 2-3 hrs.  Pausing the video every 20 seconds then talking for 5 mins
[3:13:18] Jollywhompus: I think JP is one of the best marketing minds on twitch, his marvel podcast and podcast with Cohh is absolutely brilliant
[3:13:21] TheCliffyShow: The react meta. I wanna watch someone react to someone else's content. Why the fuck is that popular?
[3:13:26] SSD511_: I only watch wow stream not a fan for shooting games or irl
[3:13:44] Rowini30: @TheCliffyShow because it's easy on your brain

[3:48:16] Knocx: whats the diffrence between regular shaker and ice shaker?
[3:48:25] AvrithSATX: My vote is for Ebonhorn.
[3:48:35] im_n0t_jezus: Choices
[3:48:37] TheCliffyShow: Fuck both of them. Ebyssian for leader.
[3:48:49] Aidler: I got myself a starbucks tumbler from Japan and paid over around 100 $ for it‚Ä¶. so no problemo
[3:48:52] Tiamarilien: @NewWorldReign Sybellian has come back from outland to dispute it. I haven't heard if Ebonhorn is chiming in though.
[3:49:17] Knocx: got cha

[3:49:48] WymGaming: the ice shaker is metal and has a cool agitator that you can remove and such
[3:49:56] im_n0t_jezus: 1 to use 1 to collect
[3:49:56] Zuhbuumafu: I waited almost 3 weeks for a lux shaker before I cancelled the order.
[3:50:00] Bartillo: @towelliee are you going to hop into FF14 6.2 when it comes out Tuesday? Tons of new content being added.
[3:50:01] Tiamarilien: Pretty sure Wrathion is full of it. I think Sybellian and Ebonhorn are also Deathwing's kids too. Didn't he sire pretty much the entire flight?
[3:50:03] akia03: now i get the price of them
[3:50:09] GamingDad77: @Zuhbuumafu hope so. The sales of his stater kit should have been an example
[3:50:41] Zuhbuumafu: @GamingDad77 thats my point lol.  If I'm going to buy one, I want a hammer squad one.
[3:50:48] TheCliffyShow: @Tiamarilien Wrathion I think its more his grandson or something.
[3:50:53] Alaquane: In a surprise turn of events, it looks like Metzen the reindeer wins the vote despite not being a dragon.
[3:51:10] spookychefkarolina: @gamingdad77 hmm, I shall try them. I haven‚Äôt yet. Cotton candy is always a fave no matter which company makes it.
[3:51:16] Aidler: the lux shaker‚Ä¶ that sounds very expensive‚Ä¶ naguuraGiggle
[3:51:51] GamingDad77: @spookychefkarolina as for the smaple pack...it's my fav so far....Sherbert 2nd...Dream team punch 3rd

[3:53:08] Zuhbuumafu: @Towelliee interestingly enough, it's not on their site anymore
[3:53:12] abracka_: yeah you're better off waiting. you'll need to do the hildebrand questline that starts all the way back in ARR to start relic progression in 6.2

[3:53:35] BoezIRL: what is that wrathion voice?

[3:53:49] Alaquane: That's the stream timer Teldrin. he's been streaming for 2 hours
[3:53:50] Bartillo: They are also adding mythic + basically with criterion dungeons
[3:53:54] Vanguardigan: @Teldrin89 its the timer for how long hes been leveling so far
[3:53:56] TheCliffyShow: Isn't Dinkum like that to.
[3:53:56] HighThereBud: @Teldrin89 It's the 60-70 timer.
[3:54:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Teldrin89 The timer is going to up to track leveling speed
[3:54:06] Teldrin89: @Dragonspirit99 oh!, thx
[3:54:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://twitter.com/luxthos/status/1428406557918834691 its not on the website anymore but here is luxthos tweet about it
[3:54:37] Aidler: we like to do arbitrarily timers here Kappa
[3:54:38] spookychefkarolina: I‚Äôm just waiting for Boomer Blast to taste like Tang Towel towCopium towCopium
[3:54:45] Teldrin89: I thought adjusting the leveling speed was one of last steps in beta
[3:55:19] sinlesssinner: the RIOT MMO tho, when they release the first trailer ppl will go nuts. I bet Blizzard are monitoring that shit to get their releases away from that day

[3:58:48] MercurialPTDR: or bfa for sure

[3:59:17] sipilde: "a little"
[3:59:18] buffalo_blaz: Why do they put shit like this in the game?
[3:59:25] TheCliffyShow: When was the last time they put in a poop quest? That used to be a big thing.
[3:59:28] GamingDad77: That's what is taking so long. Developing a poop quest
[3:59:47] SauceFu: new dungeons in FFXIV will get harder the longer you take. It's explained as a dungeon wide enrage. Also no battle res so if you die you start over, everything respawns
[4:00:18] juga27: is jewel crafting going to be good in df?
[4:00:18] mrpresbaby: @SauceFu that doesn't sound fun at all

[4:08:10] spookychefkarolina: LUL LUL
[4:08:20] EKS90_: Renown in itself is not bad, it was just badly implimented into covenents, doing it correct like this? is a really good idea.
[4:08:32] EKS90_: especially with account wide progress.
[4:08:43] SlimalinTV: is there archeology on still or it was taken out>?

[4:09:23] SlimalinTV: but iguess u can still do it on the old realms right?
[4:09:26] EKS90_: @Ambevsulfr Basically yes,
[4:09:29] Thoreya: they prob just dont know what to do with it
[4:09:45] Utmost777: So we are down to just cooking and fishing?
[4:10:17] Ambersulfr: yea I like to get some value out of my play, more frequently than you know... 6-8 weeks and 21k in.
[4:10:19] NordicWolfie: is it shared?
[4:10:32] DiiscoViking: where does the rep come from, I did a few dailys and didnt get a thing
[4:10:35] AvrithSATX: I think I read somewhere that Bliz said they were working on Archy, but the revamp/update might not be with launch.
[4:10:39] EKS90_: @NordicWolfie Ion mentioned in interviews that it would be account wide.
[4:10:49] Alaquane: Makes it more digestable for sure
[4:10:52] r0b928: Is there a limit to how much renown? Can I just keep getting rep and getting rewards?
[4:11:01] Ambersulfr: Ambevsulfr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[4:11:40] EKS90_: @UtmostOwnage DF is basically a kind of a "restart" new rep stuff, new proffs, more grounded story, overhaul to UI, talent revamp.
[4:12:12] JHeartTtv: can u change talents on the fly?
[4:12:22] HighThereBud: Music making me wanna LARP
[4:12:22] gold9871: its polished now, ui is almost 20 years old
[4:12:24] Mitune: they do need to diversify the wq. the majority seems like fill bar or kill x
[4:12:25] TheUnknowing: I think it makes farming rep more interesting where as farming it before has been kind of boring
[4:12:32] house573: does anything feel like a choreff
[4:12:51] FutileDiploma: @towelliee you been following new world at all? Saw some new stuff came out maybe
[4:13:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is awesome, how you can change talents anywhere, without any reagents, as long as you aren't in combat. That's how I would have done it
[4:13:07] visaeris412: you didnt change from the build you had before
[4:13:23] visaeris412: so there were no changes to apply?
[4:13:32] troeffle: Yeah
[4:13:56] EKS90_: @wEiRdO_dUdE its a very good nice QoL, like i forgot tomes yesterday so had to HS and get summoend back cause i had to change some talents while raiding. and it just feels annoying LUL
[4:14:08] Aidler: 2 hours waiting time in the lfr queue NotLikeThis
[4:14:31] Shrenko: everyone is doing normal @Aidler
[4:14:32] SpoofAvatar: roll healer or tank and lfr queues are minutes
[4:14:35] gritbarontv: but the belluar will come and link everything together
[4:14:35] SLoPPYALieN: @wEiRdO_dUdE for sure... had to do the same in a raid yesterday too.
[4:14:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is going to be some pressure on people to change their talents for each boss in raids, but it's easy to do with loadouts
[4:15:00] daththo_: any feedback for monk talent tree?
[4:15:16] esduewow: hammers up on outside looks so sick
[4:15:19] Zuhbuumafu: #2 for sure
[4:15:19] NordicWolfie: 2nd
[4:15:20] Squirrel_nutty: yeah right one
[4:15:20] Theliahh: second one
[4:15:21] vic_ave: 2nd is better
[4:15:27] moose_noodlez: 2nd pic is AWESOME
[4:15:27] MutedBrian: the  2nd one for sure
[4:15:27] kyr_slowbro: Can you have somethinig in the hammer?
[4:15:28] BJofBorg: 2nd for sure
[4:15:31] GamingDad77: I vote 2nd
[4:15:32] Raey83: 2nd
[4:15:34] Brickneim: 2nd is better
[4:15:35] matugm: I like 2nd :)
[4:15:35] EthicalHermit: Right side, but half the words taken out IMO
[4:15:40] Knocx: the text migh be hard to read at such a small size
[4:15:46] SLoPPYALieN: 2nd.. right one. THE ONLY ONE
[4:15:47] killik1023: Agreed!
[4:15:48] rnielsen297: very small hammer
[4:15:53] LearnedSomething: it's a very celtic vibe
[4:15:53] MercurialPTDR: 2nd one
[4:15:54] spookychefkarolina: Ohhh that‚Äôs pretty cool
[4:15:55] LearnedSomething: I like it
[4:15:56] manmower: right
[4:15:56] EKS90_: @wEiRdO_dUdE already got a lock in my team that changes talents on almost every boss and stuff, but the pressure is gonna be different from guild to guild for sure. in mythic raiding im guessing its gonna be more ofa  thing, but we can also have 10 loadouts of talents. so that is also good.
[4:15:57] lalelusa: hammers up? Mir like shakers up! *dadjoke*
[4:16:00] patte2503: 2nd, no questions asked
[4:16:05] Knocx: i feel both are too busy
[4:16:09] manmower: fix the hammer though
[4:16:18] TheUnknowing: look 3 inches is a size any one can love ok? @Knocx dont be a hater Kappa
[4:16:20] TyulSK: I like the right one but the hammer part looks a little emptying

[4:16:46] samsherril: seems to be pretty fast
[4:17:05] Broomba: @towelliee - i would buy both versions of the hammer squad shaker
[4:17:14] TheUnknowing: the first few levels are always fast, it will def slow down a bit
[4:17:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's always an exp curve
[4:17:17] lalelusa: a black cup with silver/metallic engraving?
[4:17:30] spookychefkarolina: I didn‚Äôt want an ice shaker cup but now ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ towCopium towCopium towPog towPog
[4:17:32] EthicalHermit: Best way to do an actual timer, IMO
[4:17:32] MutedBrian: plus that design could be used for a Towelliee Collector Coin
[4:17:42] barktwo: What is the itemlevel of the questrewards at level 60? @Towelliee
[4:17:49] spookychefkarolina: @mutedbrian oh that‚Äôs good

[4:40:20] StarbuckTech: i used to eat taco bell all the time when I worked retail. I have not had it since 2014 tho lol
[4:40:30] Aidler: yeah, time and a tank spec is your friend. then you can solo any quest
[4:40:40] Iamteafuse: @Towelliee Have you had a beard growth journey?
[4:41:05] Abigorath: lets just hope there is enough content, without having to grind
[4:41:06] Dkgungo: Dkgungo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 119 months! 
[4:41:11] Kneckt: dont stop belivin
[4:41:12] StealthyNakroth: reaveyBM
[4:41:15] SLoPPYALieN: Did you have a Journey listening journey?! LUL
[4:41:29] theoriginalzinng: have you had a journey of journeys while listening to journey
[4:41:31] Randomizer_: journey
[4:41:35] Artenuous: do you think we'll get the animated shorts during prepatch?
[4:41:38] spookychefkarolina: I feel like Taco Bell makes me gain a disproportionate level of weight compare to all other fast food places
[4:41:38] esduewow: most casual statement ive ever heard
[4:41:38] warbringer159: isnt content a grind? sorry wat
[4:41:38] Kelsillium: i think he means without having to repeat activities
[4:41:43] choco_wow: i do love a good ole grind
[4:41:43] Iamteafuse: The journey is good
[4:41:54] ImStormin: yeah grinding is a part of the game and always has been lmfao its good
[4:41:56] Rinizon: an mmo without a grind?
[4:41:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm also a fan of a lot of content, even if they are dorky little questlines....I spent too much time playing grinder games
[4:42:03] ItsGlime: probably shouldnt play an MMO if you dont wan't a 'grind'
[4:42:12] Bayne77: Grinding IS content
[4:42:14] Theliahh: I like repeated activities
[4:42:20] esduewow: "I hope I get all my gear in content without having to do any work for it"
[4:42:31] Aidler: is this the new ring of blood?
[4:42:31] Theliahh: MMOs with the RIGHT amount of grind are the best
[4:42:35] 91Niki: Do people not know what MMOs are? Like... grinding and content on rotation IS MMOs lol
[4:42:35] ImStormin: @esduewow this what they meant lmfao
[4:42:36] gruntpunch: I hope they bring Horrific Visions back in some way

[4:43:25] caspre01: I want something to do every day but never the same thing xd
[4:43:31] Kelsillium: ok another way lol, i think he is saying he hopes you can get to level 70 after having gone through each zone. So even though you essentially do the same "kind"of activies you are still experiencing different content through different zones. i dunno man i'm trying to help here lol xD
[4:43:35] DragonofWolves: Eh you're doing a pretty good job I think towelliee
[4:43:38] DragonofWolves: you dont need help
[4:43:43] Theliahh: we recommend 5 players so you dont get bored KEKW
[4:43:44] 91Niki: @caspre01 Well then don't play MMOs
[4:43:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the extra players would be dps
[4:43:45] StarbuckTech: so there is actual dps they want 5 people lol
[4:43:49] dimentox69: is this dragonflight alpha ?
[4:44:11] StarbuckTech: it is
[4:44:12] vic_ave: it says Alpha in the title so ya
[4:44:12] Megadisaster24: I hope they bring back "A turtle Made it to the water!"
[4:44:24] SLoPPYALieN: maybe you get real mechanics if there is 5 players in the group... otherwise these mobs really just stand there and swing
[4:44:27] caspre01: @caspre01 my bad, tried to be sarcastic. I love grinds ^^
[4:44:27] Brodih_: gotta love those italian goblins
[4:44:31] GingerPurple: @Megadisaster24 no.
[4:44:37] Aidler: glad I never got into this tiktok shit. Twitter, Twitch and YT is enough for me‚Ä¶.
[4:44:40] dimentox69: how is it so far ? Did a huge break from WoW and wanna give it a try
[4:44:54] RobNXS: Was there another stat squish for lvl 60 in the expansion?
[4:44:57] abracka_: @Towelliee is that currency you get to buy gear from the renown people account bound? sorry i don't know what it's called
[4:45:16] Jarlan23: duck wq where you help them avoid tuskar hunters
[4:45:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ducks, and Tuskarrrrrrr
[4:45:18] SLoPPYALieN: BIG RED DUCK hunter pet would be great!
[4:45:20] Kelsillium: "another duck made it to the pond"
[4:45:21] 91Niki: @caspre01 All good, it can be hard to read between the serious people and sarcasm in chat :p Some people genuinely don't understand what MMOs are and complain about what they literally always have been LUL
[4:45:26] Jarlan23: and another where you shoot them down
[4:45:26] Sevcikova: I only do a few twitch streamers and youtube.. forget that other mess
[4:45:41] SLoPPYALieN: @Kelsillium LUL
[4:45:42] StarbuckTech: another duck became soup
[4:45:52] chulklol: any grind system ?
[4:46:04] Broomba: duckCreep duckArm1 duckKek duckArm2 duckRare did someone say Ducks?
[4:46:06] 91Niki: Yeah makes sense that you can't just funnel gear from main to alts. It would destroy the purpose of playing alts completely
[4:46:17] caspre01: @caspre01 <3
[4:46:18] abracka_: watch them not implement it until 10.2.5
[4:46:49] dimentox69: i would love to see a wpvp revive
[4:47:09] chulklol: is it intended to fly with dragonriding   in starter zone ?
[4:47:10] 91Niki: They always bring up some sort of gear catch up later on. But making it a day one thing, that you can just send any gear account wide is silly. Destroys the purpose of actually playing your alts
[4:47:14] dimentox69: yeah sadly
[4:47:17] StarbuckTech: how many do you have to fight?
[4:47:20] cptrogers123: Dragonriding is literally the only world content they have announced so far
[4:47:23] TheCliffyShow: PvP can be done in the world? :)
[4:47:25] TheCliffyShow: :0
[4:47:32] abracka_: how about wotlk wintergrasp being 120v120 tho
[4:47:33] CVB111: LUL
[4:47:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: If enough people raise hell about it in the forums and on social media, they will do more for world PvP
[4:47:41] ImStormin: nowadays theyd have to offer big incentives for wpvp to be a thing again lol
[4:47:42] ItsGigg: KEKW
[4:47:43] Perihelion_Olenard: Jebaited
[4:47:49] im_capy: died before classic was even over
[4:48:02] abruptdecayO_O: dude people dont want to world pvp
[4:48:05] abruptdecayO_O: classic is proof of that
[4:48:09] abruptdecayO_O: its the minority
[4:48:11] abracka_: they tried it in legion with the pvp world quests
[4:48:11] Jarlan23: just bring back the supply drop stuff from bfa
[4:48:13] abracka_: didn't work
[4:48:15] Jarlan23: it was good enough
[4:48:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: They do things with listening to PvP players, like they nerfed Vesper totem
[4:48:17] Thasin22: unless you're a druid
[4:48:17] ItsGigg: world pvp is stupid and I don't respect it
[4:48:18] lithium364: reacting to feral feedback Kappa
[4:48:19] TheCliffyShow: PvP was always a side thing.
[4:48:21] HallowSL: >Caring about a mini-game LULW
[4:48:42] warbringer159: pvp died when they added 50 different layers
[4:48:45] HonestPhilosophy: Xaryu made a pvp mage post in the forums the first day after mage trees came out, it got locked and no one could comment on it all day lol
[4:48:50] PatchesMcPatch: PVP is not part of the main design philosophy of wow
[4:48:52] RobNXS: Yeah at the moment it seems like any world pvp is just max levels trying to target people leveling alts with warmode on
[4:48:53] tebbix: PvP is good in theory, but in the practice is bad
[4:49:00] dimentox69: i mean Cobrak will come back i heard so i thought its gonna be a huge exp
[4:49:00] TheUnknowing: i dont feel like a whole lot of people care about world pvp in general any ways, I mean its basically been dead since vanilla.
[4:49:05] Theliahh: @warbringer159 war mode doesnt have 50 different layers
[4:49:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sure, it's a minority of players that do PvP in WoW, but 20% of millions of players is a lot of people
[4:49:16] HonestPhilosophy: Got locked after one comment, no ideas
[4:49:17] Aidler: I never understood PvP
[4:49:22] spookychefkarolina: @tebbix accurate
[4:49:23] StarbuckTech: this fight is gonna take a bit lol
[4:49:26] StarbuckTech: that tank dps
[4:49:26] icerasta: They have the numbers on accounts that activate War Mode. I doubt that number is number is high at all at this point. They know that it is a very small population that actually does/cares about world pvp
[4:49:29] ItsGlime: millions PepeLaugh
[4:49:41] OmgItsEdizzle: PVP is a vestige of WoW's prior life... clinging for relevance in a game that has moved on from it
[4:49:42] delaine: Have they said anything about the feedback on making all gathering professions secondary
[4:49:44] Hyelander_: Legions invasion system for pvp was pretty fun
[4:49:59] AvrithSATX: "Toxic PVPer" is a redudant label.
[4:50:04] Maydie6066: Blizzard stopped caring about PvP when they knew they couldnt offer strong PvE abilities and balance it in PvP
[4:50:06] Aidler: naguuraThinking
[4:50:15] tebbix: NODDERS
[4:50:16] Kale_Nd: There is no point in wpvp, you only waste time. there is no reward for it.
[4:50:18] Broomba: if i had DF Alpha i would help EZ
[4:50:29] gruntpunch: weekly raid controlled world pvp
[4:50:32] dimentox69: but it is fun if you wpvp and fight 1vX and do huge plays and defeat like 3-5 open world
[4:50:38] gruntpunch: or vise versa
[4:50:44] Naturalbeef: Most people with WM on never PvP. It's just for the buff
[4:50:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: At the start of Shadowlands, it was likely more than 30% of players were doing PvP because it was worth it in terms of gear rewards
[4:50:50] NytenPvP: I have fun killing people
[4:50:50] MaxTheBandit: dopamine @Towelliee
[4:50:50] RobNXS: Only use warmode for leveling alts
[4:50:50] spookychefkarolina: Learning a lot about PvP in this chat rn towSip
[4:50:51] MWilco77: didnt they post something yesterday about world pvp token from killing players for gear?
[4:50:53] dimentox69: @Towelliee yeah true it should be more rewarded
[4:50:55] onybear: I for one love having the option in whether I get my butt handed to me while I quest or not‚Ä¶I chose not to, and it is lovely lol
[4:51:02] Bayne77: Another notch on my gankmeter
[4:51:06] NytenPvP: the joy of fighting and the possibility of losing
[4:51:09] spookychefkarolina: Cumulative ganks?
[4:51:20] savagecabbage30: do pvp servers where you always tagged not exist anymore?
[4:51:21] gruntpunch: World PVP in the beginning of BFA was fun.
[4:51:24] Maydie6066: if your ally you get the Against Overwhelming Odds and it gives gear, Horde get a "well you have the numbers"
[4:51:46] dracullus: doing alliance and horde slayer was my best experience with war mode
[4:51:58] EnterSandman328: do they still mark people on the map that have a bunch of kills? think that was in legion
[4:52:00] SpoofAvatar: do want a White Dragon flight
[4:52:04] rodimusprime085: What server do you play on?
[4:52:04] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[4:52:05] Aidler: I also use warmode for leveling and hope the pvp guys don‚Äôt find me‚Ä¶.
[4:52:11] lithium364: i loved the supply drops and heroic item rewards
[4:52:22] popestar_: I liked legion pvp with the world pvp dailies too
[4:52:23] dimentox69: @Towelliee the Dagger that made you against both factions was fun aswell
[4:52:24] RobNXS: I think world PvP was in it's prime when people were still making montage videos for warcraft movies
[4:52:25] gruntpunch: The Alliance formed an entire raid group to hunt me down after being marked on the map. Good times
[4:52:25] Jarlan23: the nazjatar stuff was fun even i did it. the problem was the lag
[4:52:28] spookychefkarolina: @aidler they always find you LUL
[4:52:33] TheCliffyShow: I remember using war mode all the time in BFA. Hardly ever got attacked. Most of the time people left each other alone.
[4:52:33] Angsterz: corruption pvp was funny- one shots everywehre out of nowhere
[4:52:41] Shredx: pvp is the best content for wow
[4:52:42] DragonofWolves: The satisfaction of having chat laugh at them when you beat them towelliee. But chat isn't that mean right chat? riiiight?
[4:53:07] Venasmat: @shredx LUL
[4:53:11] StarbuckTech: the cherry limeade focus was pretty good
[4:53:16] spookychefkarolina: @thecliffyshow dead ass turned it on once and died repetitively until I turned it off. No one left me alone.
[4:53:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, they shouldn't force people to PvP...but it needs to stay a viable option that has real content and rewards, in my opinion
[4:53:41] Kneckt: kiwi lime is good too, strawberry lemonade also
[4:53:42] Shredx: @Pouilla it is, but buttons arejust too hard to press for some players
[4:53:43] im_capy: max levels ganking lowbies and killing quest givers isnt helping. Maybe if you cant pvp unless you are within level range of the zone, or max lvl can only fight max lvl in the same zone.
[4:53:47] spookychefkarolina: @starbucktech ooo but describe it. Is it limecentric or cherrycentric
[4:53:49] RobNXS: also for casual pvp it takes a LONG time to gain any reqards from your honor level, even being account wide
[4:54:07] CrossedUpTV: sipping on the Mango Splash focus ATM
[4:54:08] MrHI6HWAY: corruption was so much fun
[4:54:12] storm99413: twilight devastation KEKW
[4:54:14] StarbuckTech: that kiwi lime was very good... strong lime taste @Kneckt
[4:54:15] Angsterz: mindflays xD
[4:54:17] Kneckt: NODDERS
[4:54:25] azuriens: I had full gushing on assa rogue and it PLOWED
[4:54:31] Felldoh_: Blizz should just bring back PvP servers. Keep War Mode for folks who want to dip their toe in... but dedicated PvP servers could help out
[4:54:38] StealthyNakroth: Show us what they look like! lol
[4:54:42] dimentox69: there was some broken sht in corruptions i guess
[4:54:44] Kuzzo99: I went full tentacle build on my ret pally my tentacles would do like 30% of peoples health in one tick lol
[4:55:03] StarbuckTech: quiet day at work thus far... no tickets to work or sql server updates to do
[4:55:08] Kneckt: CiGrip
[4:55:18] Venasmat: @shredx PVP is just an optional content for WOW and everyone knows it, even the devs themselves
[4:55:19] raldrik: @StarbuckTech  wanna do mine for me then?
[4:55:26] Mitune: they just need to add the mechanics
[4:55:29] StarbuckTech: haha nope
[4:55:36] Pty_Navaja: is this the actual zone music?
[4:55:58] Ryot101: i feel like the issues is, "war mode" has just been banished to the realm of nonexistentance or, a PVE oriented tool. leading to its being a relatively "dead" system. so like, why have a dead system or a system not working as intended. my POV solely.  @towelliee
[4:56:00] raldrik: I have a nice juicy mariadb version upgrade in my queue
[4:56:11] reeaperz1: Do you feel different drinking the focus vs energy?
[4:56:15] spookychefkarolina: @starbucktech ew don‚Äôt drop the T word like that. Like it‚Äôs nothing.
[4:56:37] Kale_Nd: @StarbuckTech don't jinx it
[4:56:43] pringlez91: DF alpha will definitely bring ppl back to WoW and unsub to the other MMO
[4:57:06] Intikamcy: YES
[4:57:08] Felldoh_: Yup
[4:57:19] Snirs: Just only PvP servers
[4:57:23] abracka_: never forget the 40 man alliance raids in BFA with warmode to get their max ilvl gear for the week because of the bonus
[4:57:23] ItsGlime: wish it was still seperate =/
[4:57:27] PatchesMcPatch: Server at all is a defunct system.  look at the imbalances/dead servers that happen
[4:57:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like PvE servers, no hassle unless  I feel like it, but some people love that danger of always having enemies out there
[4:57:31] dracullus: no, sometimes I want world PVP, sometimes I don't, now I have choice
[4:57:34] Promilie: Feral is completely unsalvagable
[4:57:53] Intikamcy: 10% exp boost on pvp servers
[4:57:55] dracullus: it just needs separate rewards, it's that simple
[4:58:03] PatchesMcPatch: @dracullus this
[4:58:09] Hyelander_: Blizzards already making factions play together. no way theyre going back to separating them and making separate servers
[4:58:12] gruntpunch: They have arenas and even that's not pvp friendly for most players.

[4:58:47] tahmuu: pvp-only cosmetics would get people starting pvp
[4:58:57] RobNXS: I think a lot of  people see world  pvp as an inconvenience when it happens
[4:59:05] Felldoh_: People talk about world pvp like its something that Blizzard designed... world pvp happened because players on pvp servers got bored when there wasn't enough content and we started fighting against each other in areas where there were close alliance/horde nodes. thats it
[4:59:05] nightkok: the hardest blizzard ever pushed pvp was the pvp essence for the heart of azeroth that was mandatory for some specs and people hated it
[4:59:13] Shrenko: says you

[5:05:59] ItsGigg: Lets go do +25 ifirit for my BIS ear
[5:06:00] Alaquane: I think the FF14 x Monster Hunter World events were pretty good
[5:06:35] abracka_: @HaxzorJimDuggan classic players would be in shambles
[5:06:57] ItsGigg: Maybe Eorzea x Azeroth is what the jailer was protecting us from

[5:12:53] thefraanzz: I wish they made it harder to lvl honestly.. pulling entire camps just doesnt feel good
[5:13:01] catalyticflow: that's why they're called the "not good"
[5:13:13] SLoPPYALieN: @catalyticflow precisely
[5:13:21] nightkok: so like the highmountain tauren again
[5:13:27] cannibalcanyon: sup brotha, happy Friday! @towelliee
[5:13:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[5:13:46] thefraanzz: true
[5:13:57] Hyelander_: I mean, you can level without a gear, if you want a challenge
[5:14:03] catalyticflow: If they scale the game with you overall it doesn't matter how fast you level
[5:14:11] PatchesMcPatch: whats wrong with leveling pepehands
[5:14:14] catalyticflow: i.e. scale low stauff to max
[5:14:14] 91Niki: If you want leveling to be harder, just don't put on gear upgrades. Easy done. It's now harder for you while the rest of us can enjoy it being easy LUL
[5:14:23] Killuf: @Towelliee protesting in the WoW community is normal. people cry for everything
[5:14:24] iM1KE_: please let ret pally dual wield
[5:14:25] ArcaneSyntax: leveling right now is fastest it's ever been and it's great
[5:14:25] Verdell263: I feel like that's the way with the current S4 dungeons. They polled and everyone not playing picked the choices
[5:14:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: The concept of the journey being important is outdated in gaming....it's about just a little trip through it and then starting endgame
[5:14:53] ThrasiusGG: i think leveling should just be there as an introduction to systems, zones and storylines. it shouldn't be hard
[5:15:10] TheBoogs: Holy crap he‚Äôs already almost 64? Dude is leveling so fast
[5:15:16] Hyelander_: @iM1KE_ Yes! also, make it shapeshift to bear, cat and be a ranged caster
[5:15:41] SLoPPYALieN: a whole neeeeeeeeeeeeeeew wooooorld!!!
[5:15:43] Kelsillium: Can you dragon ride across an entire zone without landing?
[5:15:54] abracka_: holy shit i never noticed the skybox in DF, that looks amazing
[5:16:03] codefiveone: the game begins at max level, the game is NOT leveling and is a distraction
[5:16:11] iM1KE_: @Hyeland3r im serious all other plate classes can why not pally
[5:16:25] Broomba: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny

[5:16:54] Hyelander_: @iM1KE_ Im serious too. Why cant pallies have heroic leap and death grip. other plates classes can
[5:17:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like leveling and feeling my character get stronger with new abilities, but people don't have the patience we used to
[5:17:09] spookychefkarolina: Would please like an Oni sticker to be dropped Towel, I‚Äôll buy like 10 of them
[5:17:32] 91Niki: @iM1KE_ We know you're being serious, but then where is the limit? Someone wants their monk to be able to use a shield cuz other classes can. Or have shamans be able to shape shift into a bear, or this or that. Gotta put a limit somewhere. Can't please every wish
[5:18:08] PatchesMcPatch: @iM1KE_ im serious, too. why cant pallies have hybernate and sap and abttle res other classes can
[5:18:13] GiraffeHydra_: I want flying form for paladins, we've had wings longer than druids dammit
[5:18:14] iM1KE_: @91Niki  i suppose your right
[5:18:39] Sollice: Play a game that only uses armor types as the limiting factor and not class fantasy
[5:18:44] Sollice: Cause WoW aint that lol
[5:18:51] 91Niki: @GiraffeHydra sacLUL
[5:18:54] DpDiablo: hey people
[5:18:54] Sh0cko: @91Niki shaman ghost bird when?
[5:19:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I could be alright with a paladin flight form as long as it's one of those big winged people picking them up and carrying them around like a rag doll LUL

[5:20:00] spookychefkarolina: @sollice yes it is
[5:20:14] Sollice: @MrBlue_Skyy Maybe?
[5:20:16] GiraffeHydra_: I think he means our favorite boys in blue
[5:20:31] Hyelander_: Paladin flight form: You bubble and fly away like a balloon
[5:20:44] Sollice: @GiraffeHydra Oh the kyrian? BUdget Valks lol
[5:20:44] GiraffeHydra_: even better lol
[5:20:46] ShintzTTV: the holy wingzzzzzzzzzzz
[5:21:15] GiraffeHydra_: @Sollice I prefer the term "mass production" vs "limited series" Kappa
[5:21:28] DragonofWolves: Why does this music sound like its from Diablo 3?
[5:21:44] Sollice: Because it is
[5:21:49] spookychefkarolina: @dragonofwolves because it is
[5:21:51] Sollice: Alpha doesnt have music in it
[5:21:58] spookychefkarolina: @sollice no get outta here
[5:22:38] GiraffeHydra_: @spookychefkarolina sorry, he gets full marks and you scored a 0

[5:22:42] Mr_Pennywise_: pepeMeltdown dracJAM
[5:23:04] spookychefkarolina: @giraffehydra towRee towRee
[5:23:06] Gezber: dracJAM
[5:23:21] GiraffeHydra_: @Sollice would make sense, the music for when Shalamourne came out was titled "Anduin's balls finally drop" Kappa
[5:23:26] wastecasetv: Towel playing on 4k game looks much more crisp
[5:23:55] Sollice: @wastecasetv I dont think he plays on 4k unless I missed something
[5:24:03] Sollice: unless he upscales it
[5:24:22] wastecasetv: okay ty maybe they just better rendering in the new zones
[5:24:34] wastecasetv: just have **
[5:24:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: He's got a 3090, he could play on 4K easily
[5:24:40] Sollice: Oh yea in DF they pushed out the view distance purposefully
[5:24:54] wastecasetv: that's what it is looks soo open
[5:25:00] Sollice: Yea
[5:25:34] wastecasetv: dope can't wait. hope they don't push back the release date
[5:25:46] wastecasetv: like legion or was it bfa

[5:26:39] spookychefkarolina: I‚Äôm rooting for a January release tbh it‚Äôs a good post holiday decompressor
[5:26:50] Evi_lynn: "timed leveling experience" ?
[5:27:13] Sollice: I think he is timing how long it takes him to get from 60-70 in Alpha
[5:27:21] wardom313: Has there been talk about pushing it back?
[5:27:27] Evi_lynn: o
[5:27:31] Sollice: Clock above his webcam indicates time elapsed. Paused now because he isnt activley playing
[5:27:36] Sollice: @Caliban207 No
[5:27:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: A January release would give them more time and make it easier for the race to world first, but on the business side they gotta get back to Q4 releases for the best sales
[5:27:48] Jarlan23: theres nothing to push back theres no official release date
[5:27:51] newkingcody: they already said it was releasing before the end of the year when they allowed pre orders
[5:27:54] Sollice: Ehh. January doesnt make much sense
[5:27:57] Jarlan23: just in 2022
[5:28:03] Sollice: Basically companies dont get much done in December
[5:28:20] Sollice: So if your not going to go in Nov or Dec- Jan doesnt make much sense. Would be Feb or March
[5:28:25] socialfreakout: my money is on a Christmas release
[5:28:35] HeatherJC83: is towellee poopin lol
[5:28:49] spookychefkarolina: Yes however wouldn‚Äôt a December release encourage spending more than a January release? Consumerism dies down once January rolls in.
[5:29:24] spookychefkarolina: I can‚Äôt see December sales for any company matching January sales.
[5:29:34] socialfreakout: they're releasing wrath classic next month I can only imagine dragonflight isn't far behind
[5:29:37] wastecasetv: pretty sure they already said it would be in December
[5:30:02] wastecasetv: think it was on the website or battlenet
[5:30:04] cptlusciousbeard: november 26th is the ''leaked date''
[5:30:07] Sollice: @spookychefkarolina Thats why it will be Nov or Dec- Otherwise no sense until March
[5:30:07] Shattermare: I miss towel
[5:30:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Black Friday is the biggest day in sales for the US.... you want to be able to really push the game for that
[5:30:47] Thoreya: thinkin DF isnt coming in november towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:30:50] ZenLiving: Prost!
[5:30:51] Shattermare: @weirdo_dude Becomes less true and more of a coincidence when it‚Äôs a global/international release
[5:30:52] ArcaneMaki: Sant√©!
[5:30:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: It doesn't have to release on Black Friday, but it needs to be close enough that people really want to spend some of their Christmas money on it....to make the most money
[5:30:56] TSquadSully: towBeer
[5:30:56] tebbix: Salud!!
[5:30:57] Thoreya: cheers

[5:31:18] Zayvion: its friday!
[5:31:20] cyxanacma1023: good morning  :D
[5:31:23] Sollice: @Towelliee I cant make any old fashions. Waiting for my black cherry cocktails cherries to be delievered today
[5:31:28] Broomba: its 5 o clock somewhere
[5:31:29] Shattermare: Not an alcoholic
[5:31:30] socialfreakout: it's 5 o'clock somewhere amiright
[5:31:31] Sathalan: its time to enjoy life momomiSip
[5:31:32] Sollice: Plus I drank all of my bourbon last night...
[5:31:33] StarbuckTech: i am thinking about grabbing a beer lol
[5:31:43] cptlusciousbeard: they'll release it before December ready or not, its blizzard.. they need that quarter revenue boost
[5:31:45] Aidler: time is irrelevant
[5:31:45] Sh0cko: sipping cold brew at work a little hungover, does that count?
[5:31:47] Mecabeast: so just finished ep1 of she hulk it might end up better than loki
[5:31:53] jkitchin75: its 5 o clock somewhere
[5:32:03] socialfreakout: crown mixed with sweet tea is the tits
[5:32:05] Jarlan23: i heard really mixed reviews about she hulk
[5:32:08] StarbuckTech: I am at work but the WFH life allows for beers lol
[5:32:22] Shattermare: Does Rule 34 apply to She Hulk?
[5:32:23] Quojin: its funny as hell
[5:32:24] Sollice: @Towelliee I bought a bottle of this the other day... Was actually pretty good shorturl.at/sBDMO
[5:32:25] EKS90_: she-hulk is fine.
[5:32:33] smashwow: wasn't advertised well
[5:32:34] ArcaneSyntax: it's got good reviews
[5:32:37] spookychefkarolina: Aren‚Äôt old fashioned made with angostura bitters classically?
[5:32:40] Parudin: Ya just turn your brain off and enjoy the show for what it is. It's funny
[5:32:40] Jarlan23: yeah some were good some were bad. but some people think it leans too far into comedy
[5:32:45] smashwow: seems like it'll be ok
[5:33:01] smashwow: but bobby wants it. Kappa
[5:33:03] cptlusciousbeard: ''need'' from investors pushing
[5:33:11] Zayvion: they got that review from Diablo Immortal XD
[5:33:11] Sollice: They don't need revenue...They have already been purchased. This year could be a complete wash
[5:33:12] Molvonos: towSweat
[5:33:13] socialfreakout: they're taking a huge hit with Diablo immortal. huge flop
[5:33:17] smashwow: bobby needs the final yacht
[5:33:19] SincerelyNikola: They made 100 million dollars off of Diablo immortal haha
[5:33:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Blizzard is going to be fine regardless, especially with Wrath, but yeah in going forward
[5:33:23] Sollice: Now 2023 is when they need revenue to show Microsoft what they can do
[5:33:25] Jarlan23: did any of you watch all of ms mavel? i never started it and was wondering if it was good
[5:33:30] WhoIsAndrewJ: imagine the hate they'll get if they dont release it before 12/31 though
[5:33:33] Shattermare: Yeah too bad they‚Äôre not smart
[5:33:35] catalyticflow: 10.0 prepatch is technically the xpac so that'd work
[5:33:38] WhoIsAndrewJ: since that's the "date" on the store page or w/e
[5:33:47] Thoreya: for real lol
[5:33:51] spookychefkarolina: @jarlan23 it‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs a lot ‚Äúyounger‚Äù than the rest of them.
[5:33:59] Jarlan23: they got overwatch 2 pve in 2023
[5:34:06] Thoreya: they already purchased the company LUL
[5:34:15] Jarlan23: and diablo 4 probably
[5:34:15] Sollice: @Towelliee Yeah...too bad the past 3 or so years has almost completely wiped out Blizzards name
[5:34:16] Sh0cko: @Towelliee  what do you think the chances of MS pushing for a wow 2 in the next decade?
[5:34:20] CrunkyBrewster: Oh hell no LULW
[5:34:22] Shattermare: Do you think Blizzard loves gamin and shit?
[5:34:23] catalyticflow: that' why they bought em
[5:34:24] spookychefkarolina: @jarlan23 haven‚Äôt seen the finale yet but I‚Äôve been pleased with the series thus far.
[5:34:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: more
[5:34:31] CrunkyBrewster: M$ loves it
[5:34:36] TialePetit: Clearly MS knows EXACTLY what they can do and have done
[5:34:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Our savior, Phil Spencer!
[5:34:41] encrypt2: Microsoft doesn't care, they are just buying the IP's. they don't care about 2022's sales
[5:34:41] edohran: Microsoft is looking at how they did it to do the same to the next Halo project.
[5:34:43] cabalish: i like money
[5:34:49] socialfreakout: microactiblizzard
[5:34:58] Sollice: @cabalish We doing the Idiocracy thing again!
[5:34:58] jkitchin75: when did making 100m turn into being a flop?
[5:35:05] Sollice: OH MY BALLS
[5:35:09] catalyticflow: i thought overwatch 2 was free thoguh
[5:35:12] Shattermare: @jkitchin75 TRUE
[5:35:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: i could go for a latte
[5:35:16] Molvonos: @Sollice Welcome to Costco, I love you.
[5:35:16] Sufix: CoD
[5:35:22] Thoreya: if its ready then yes they shoul;d
[5:35:24] Shrenko: December is the best time to play WOW imo its so cozy
[5:35:26] Sollice: @Sollice Go away! Batn
[5:35:28] Jarlan23: overwatch 2 pvp is free the pve comes out next year and will be paid
[5:35:28] Thoreya: prolonging the inevitable is dumb
[5:35:31] Pilha390: @catalyticflow yes the pvp part not the pve
[5:35:41] cptlusciousbeard: they dont need it but investor prolly pushing for that quarter boost so they can dip with a gain

[5:36:20] JEM_GG: fall months with a window open
[5:36:21] Felldoh_: Brrewwwwfeesssttttttt
[5:36:26] Thoreya: @gronnlir no
[5:36:42] Molvonos: I need Microsoftserve Blizzard to make a new, better version of Rock and Roll Racing.
[5:36:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want to see WoW on console, there are so many console gamers....they should have access to WoW. Other MMOs do it
[5:36:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: when the grass stops growing and i dont have to cut that shit are the best months
[5:36:51] ArcaneMaki: Fall months with a window open is spot on!

[5:44:02] Nehcrom: There are downtime counters.. and there are just counters right?
[5:44:08] love_eggplant: is it long for 4 levels to take almost 4 hrs?
[5:44:10] Aidler: probably the China MDI
[5:44:19] smashwow: season 2 this year i think
[5:44:30] Nehcrom: Could be a timer for how long time towel can take questions that are dumb.
[5:44:54] 91Niki: @Nehcrom That timer would go wayyyyy too high to fit on the screen Kappa
[5:44:54] smashwow: ASTRA was china

[5:46:04] smashwow: they didnt' win the grands
[5:46:08] Sollice: Yeah well...lol
[5:46:14] smashwow: but regardless beating echo is huge
[5:46:48] smashwow: i thought they did the back to back. had to go and look
[5:47:10] FeralLikeMe: the only way you beat echo is if they make a big mistake
[5:47:21] Molvonos: @Sollice Sol, do they use authentic, free roaming babies to make baby powder?
[5:47:25] Shrenko: catJAM
[5:47:44] HeatherJC83: is that in game music?

[5:49:23] smashwow: @Alaquane it's at least a 2 year contract
[5:49:25] Thoreya: or arena
[5:49:28] catalyticflow: They oly think about demon hunters when they're putting in invisible walls
[5:49:35] smashwow: GP just isn't a wow esport
[5:50:06] Thoreya: ill say tho the great push rewards are certainly catching up to MDI LUL
[5:50:21] Kasvot_Vaxt: dont get me wrong love wow but idk dont feel like its a very good spectator sport
[5:50:22] FeralLikeMe: yeah demon hunters are getting deleted because there can't be 2 races with wings
[5:50:26] Alaquane: All the same casters just has my brain in copium mode I guess

[5:55:30] abracka_: never forget the early days of 4 loko doing that
[5:55:33] Molvonos: Making bad decisions faster
[5:55:34] Molvonos: lol

[5:56:34] Quakezilla69: the dispel affix on jailer is so annoying
[5:56:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I used to love vodka and lemonade, and I bet it would go good with kiwi lime, but gotta be careful
[5:56:53] xxCameleon77xx: Just got the starter. Going to try strawberry lemonade?
[5:56:54] spookychefkarolina: @molvonos if you want to risk your life
[5:57:05] 91Niki: Gattz and I made popsicles with gfuel. Those turned out great. I am sure you can use any energy powder like that to make popsicles :D
[5:57:37] Molvonos: @91Niki Adv Slushies actually sounds really good.
[5:58:03] 91Niki: Yeah I wish slush ice machines wasn't so darn expensive. I'd def get one and make slush ice all day haha
[5:58:08] Mecabeast: the chaotic motes on  rygelon  are troll af
[5:58:22] Molvonos: Yooo, hold on Niki, I'll send you two things I used.
[5:58:23] ProfessorChaoos: Will you be leveling pally first, or monk ?
[5:58:32] 91Niki: Gonna try and use vanilla ice cream with one of the cakey flavors next for popsicles

[5:59:57] 91Niki: @spookychefkarolina I am sure you can use a blender if you really want. Mix the powder with just enough water to mix it. Then ice cubes for the rest and throw it in the blender. Assuming you have a blender that can crush ice
[6:00:07] Murlock07: KEKWlaugh
[6:00:15] ArcaneMaki: What would you say feel are the main differences with the new bear in Dragonflight? @Towelliee
[6:00:44] smashwow: they didn't want him wearing the tutu again Kappa
[6:00:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I thought it was just a joke, with the dragon cosplay

[6:00:51] spookychefkarolina: @91niki towSweat my blender is from the 90s I don‚Äôt think it could handle it. It would probably be it‚Äôs last hurrah if I tried to blend ice LUL

[6:04:08] Frank4LuLz: bobby's drones
[6:04:10] BlackCl0ud: imagine blaming community managers for game problems
[6:04:22] xmedpakx: blame the server for your food being overcooked
[6:04:28] xmedpakx: same mentality
[6:05:04] Exxcar: Sloot apparently wants to not remember this bruv night @Towelliee slootKEK
[6:05:08] 91Niki: Sup @Dcarter sacWAVE
[6:05:25] Sollice: @xmedpakx If the server sucks and it sits at the hot window too long they could be blamed for it. .....I am not paying attention to the conversation just wanted to add
[6:05:26] nightkok: emerald dream, been there done that
[6:05:35] codefiveone: responsibility

[6:05:53] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee hi and hi chat
[6:06:08] Exxcar: I mean home ownership is probably something I'll never get to do at this rate peepoSad
[6:06:29] 91Niki: If you send death threats to anyone, idc who, you seriously deserves to be slapped in the face. It's a shitty thing to do no matter the circumstances
[6:06:34] Exxcar: Can I have a drink for that? slootKEK
[6:06:45] Sollice: @Exxcar I wouldn't get too gloom and doom yet. Housing already slid 3% this month. Intrest rates going up means less people buying house, means more inventory, means lower prices
[6:06:46] 91Niki: KEKW
[6:07:06] NetherRegion: or an asset, but sure
[6:07:22] Kalculated88: im going to look at a place here in 3 hrs
[6:07:33] Sollice: @Towelliee That's because they want to change their life style constantly
[6:07:37] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Exxcar don't feel bad i probably won't  own a house either
[6:07:43] 91Niki: They move around too much to bother buying
[6:07:58] EyecuGaming: they "own" them but through there corporation and then rent from their own corporation

[6:07:59] jaalexba: They'd have to cut the grass
[6:08:04] 91Niki: What Sollice said. And also people like actors who work all over the place. Renting makes more sense
[6:08:16] Deekan33: Deekan33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 64 months! 
[6:08:16] Aidler: most of them have agents and do very little themselves
[6:08:17] 91Niki: @jaalexba HA, they hire people for that shit LUL
[6:08:18] Sollice: I better buy a house next year though. Intel is opening a factory in my city and the average starting poay is $130,000. Housing is going to shoot through the roof
[6:08:31] Sollice: New Albany Ohio Silicon Valley of the mid west
[6:08:32] xmedpakx: they own a yacht and travel then rent out their homes to us scrubs
[6:08:32] wetttnine: The money they‚Äôre getting from their properties is funding their nomadic lifestyle
[6:08:34] jaalexba: @jaalexba LUL
[6:08:41] danofpv: @Sollice  I see you live in Columbus....
[6:08:42] spookychefkarolina: @sollice not raining on what you said, but it‚Äôs hard to be gloom and doom when you‚Äôve been looking for almost five years and nothing has gone through. In the time my fianc√© and I started looking pricing went up substantially and now we‚Äôre stuck where we are because we can‚Äôt find lower rent or a home.
[6:08:47] Molvonos: @Sollice Buy only so you can sell it at a much higher price down the line.  Make sure you rennovate bathroom/kitchen tho
[6:08:51] NetherRegion: living the dream
[6:09:09] OmgItsEdizzle: grant cardone
[6:09:09] tmiguel27: They problably do rent to escape property taxes
[6:09:09] SLoPPYALieN: @Sollice so damn true... I'm a bit north in Michigan, but y'all's housing market going to go cray cray
[6:09:18] 91Niki: @Sollice Gattz parents are still looking. Was hoping to find something before the end of the year. But the good houses go so fast, and those left need wayy too much work on them
[6:09:24] Sollice: @Sollice Just figuring our budget now. Doing it after the first of the year I think
[6:09:28] OmgItsEdizzle: billionaire real-estate tycoon
[6:09:33] Sollice: @kahrgan00 I do :P
[6:09:44] wetttnine: Whoaaa
[6:09:47] Durithane: @towelliee we bought ours a year before and it went up 100k
[6:09:52] danofpv: @Sollice We bought a house  10 minutes from new albany, last year. Our estimate on our has has already increased by 40k
[6:09:56] Sollice: Mother in law is a real estate closing agent so we are well informed on things
[6:10:02] spookychefkarolina: Living in SFL housing has been rough to come by.
[6:10:11] spookychefkarolina: That‚Äôs lucky
[6:10:14] Sollice: @kahrgan00 Yeah I was looking in Westerville or Upper Arlington. I like Westerville
[6:10:14] r0b928: Microsoft is building a data center in my town, and the bears are moving to the neighboring town. House prices are going to sky rocket
[6:10:39] Sollice: jesus
[6:10:41] TheDabbai: yall probably saved her more headache trying to sift through buyers and paper work, etc
[6:10:44] NetherRegion: thats a bomb landlord
[6:10:46] Frank4LuLz: you stole it
[6:10:46] Sollice: 2.6 is crazy. It's double in 3 years
[6:10:55] danofpv: @Sollice  Westerville is okay, but it suffered from the before the big boom, where everything is SORT of nice, but not as nice as say... dublin
[6:10:58] CCG_337: lol same happend to me, we bought our house because the landlord needed money
[6:11:12] r0b928: I‚Äôm at 3.2% on mine
[6:11:12] codefiveone: i got mine at below 2%
[6:11:13] Frank4LuLz: for were you live, you fucking stole it, i know the area
[6:11:13] spookychefkarolina: I wish rent to buy was still a thing
[6:11:23] Sollice: @Towelliee 30 year fixed right now is 5.15%
[6:11:48] Manferno: I work as a mortgage underwriter, rates are still ridiculous
[6:11:54] bablii18: @Towelliee Think about it in the opposite way...It is just the market. it goes up and down..some make money..some loose money...in 2008 crisis..
[6:11:56] ZeusDNA: I bought my house last October and got a 2.25% rate
[6:11:56] NetherRegion: 800 sq ft?
[6:11:58] Einherjarthule: 38k for a house?
[6:11:59] Rulem: damn
[6:12:02] danofpv: I have a 4 bedroom, 2 full bath, with unfinished full basement

[6:19:41] Onearmyof2: 1 bedroom 650sqft for $2400 a month in Vancouver its fun out here
[6:19:53] spookychefkarolina: @1337raids incorrect. Even places around homestead are going up astronomically for what you get versus the work it takes to maintain. Not to mention commuting.
[6:19:54] EKS90_: Even as a maaajor ysera fan, I know its 100% popular voted haha

[6:20:23] Durithane: also Malfurion is a wuss
[6:20:26] Archiee: He's just been a waste of a main character his whole life
[6:20:30] CCG_337: He is a simp....

[6:20:34] Vile_: Like, the people who say "he's a whiny, crying bitch because 'tyrande my love.'" That was Xavius.
[6:20:35] naznarens: He cucked Illidan
[6:20:40] Vile_: That was NOT Malfurion lmao
[6:20:42] tornbraclet: i am waiting for this new appartment complex to get build near where i live so i can move in there and get out of this $1200 rent
[6:20:44] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: thats the point, malf too goody two shoe
[6:20:45] BlueBlurPrime: book malf > game malf
[6:20:47] Xailen: I hate Ysera for Malfurions sake, dumb story point
[6:20:50] Onearmyof2: hasnt he just been sleeping the last few years?
[6:20:59] Archiee: yeah
[6:21:00] SoulToned: people forget that the whiny tyrande line couldve just as well been xavius mimicking him
[6:21:00] xhaven: it was
[6:21:01] Archiee: lol
[6:21:02] Onearmyof2: yeah it was
[6:21:05] Vile_: Yes, Towelliee, I'm addressing someone else.
[6:21:05] naznarens: It was yes
[6:21:06] Mr_Pennywise_: it was
[6:21:06] tebbix: Yeah that was cool
[6:21:11] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: aint like a bad ass like his brother
[6:21:12] Rottencoarse: it was malfurion lol
[6:21:22] 91Niki: @Sollice They knew they would move again and some point, when they were at the campground. Said fuck it and only unpacked what they needed, left the rest in boxes.
[6:21:26] Vile_: It wasn't Malfurion who was saying "tyrande help me ooooh" and crying in Legion. People often think it is.
[6:21:28] dreamwalker213: @spookychefkarolina yep, because we get the rich retired people from up north jacking up all the prices
[6:21:29] Dogjah: I have a buddy in London Onatrio paying 2200.00 month plus utilties for a three bedroom home
[6:21:35] newkingcody: imagine blizz letting an alliance chcracter have a cool moment
[6:21:36] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: do all the wrg things and at the end to be proven be right
[6:21:41] Vile_: But in the Darkshore scene? Yeah, totally him. Totally such a cool cutscene.
[6:21:49] Rabiahtaro132: I don't think they knew what to do with him
[6:21:49] brabblesauce: what lvl?
[6:21:54] Bsirk: He did more in Warcraft 3 than he has in the mmo.
[6:21:58] Molvonos: @THEBUSHTHUG Who wants to give Alliance anything?  Gosh.   They should know their place.  towSip
[6:22:12] Rulem: didn't Illidan leave the planet to build an army to face off against the legion?  And then we came and fucked it all up in BC?
[6:22:21] Onearmyof2: hes the one narrating that too
[6:22:25] Vile_: Someone said it earlier, but IIRC book Malfurion > game Malfurion in cool factor.
[6:22:46] spookychefkarolina: @dreamwalker213 I work in association management in the accounting dep. It‚Äôs not only the rich individuals, it‚Äôs also all the migration going on. But most states are experiencing that issue in some capacity or another.

[6:23:40] MOLAR305: retail reboots?
[6:23:40] dreamwalker213: @spookychefkarolina for sure, at the end of the day florida definitely is on the cheaper side compared to other states. The BIG problem is wages arent going up with it like other areas
[6:23:47] xmedpakx: bronze dragonflight can erase that "forever" mentality

[6:29:20] theDirtyon3: Yeah he DE's Guldan's Skull twice actually EKKW
[6:29:28] Sollice: I mean, nothing really is settled from the SL expansion....The dreadlords are all still out there and they have Denathrius
[6:29:32] gusterugamer: @gusterugamer Yeah, but i was saying that is was saying that is was not in full power at that time because just got ressurected idk why i remember this part
[6:29:36] Aidler: Illidan the white
[6:29:42] Sollice: So.....another way SL was so pointless
[6:29:45] 91Niki: @dreamwalker213 Best of luck with that ! Hope you manage to get in. Only hear good things about it from Gattz. Sadly a lot of work up north is solar work. Which is the worst you can get into. But the pay makes up for it
[6:29:45] Vile_: @Sollice Big true.
[6:29:55] 91Niki: @spookychefkarolina Oh I am hahaha
[6:29:59] Artenuous: he is probably as strong as a weaker titan, not as strong as eonar/amanthul/sarg
[6:30:06] theDirtyon3: they already said denathrius is coming back at some point too
[6:30:12] 1337RAIDS: blizzard is running out of ideas and content, RIP.
[6:30:25] ZeusDNA: "Illidan the Betrayer.. Yes, that was my name. I am Illidan the white, and I come back to you now - at the turn of the tide"

[6:30:43] theDirtyon3: Sargeras and Denathrius expac ...boom
[6:30:43] Vile_: I mean, I'm sure Denny and the Nathrezim were gonna be the OG S4 stuff.
[6:30:51] Frank4LuLz: what sword

[6:30:58] jkitchin75: @1337raids towStop towIt

[6:31:21] Vile_: Oh, also -- Kintessa has her new cooking show to film.
[6:31:21] abracka_: i mean, s4 we have the brokers just straight up imprisoning the nathrezim and taking them
[6:31:24] Vile_: Barefoot Kintessa

[6:31:29] omnireapergaming: no mal is alive
[6:31:30] deliora7: MALGA NIS IS NOT DEAD AGAIN ?
[6:31:34] Molvonos: Demons are Legion, Dreadlords died in Shadowlands homie
[6:31:38] firehawk73: he died, but didn't die die
[6:31:45] brabblesauce: what lvl currently?
[6:31:46] Frank4LuLz: just bring in chromie, time fuck it all again

[6:31:53] Rastailian: like the princess bride: he's only mostly dead
[6:31:54] BlackCl0ud: bro mal'ganis is like kel'thuzad, the game dies before they die
[6:31:55] cptrogers123: Man why is it US TGP this weekend ResidentSleeper
[6:31:58] Molvonos: @omnibloodgaming That's not correct.
[6:31:59] gusterugamer: I know that to kill a demon you ahve to kill it in TN
[6:32:00] mak7: jailer really dead? I think not
[6:32:07] mak7: kappa
[6:32:10] MOLAR305: cant nathrazine only die in the void?
[6:32:12] 91Niki: @dreamwalker213 Oh nice! Best of luck. They just got the deal for a GIANT solar panel project in Maine where he lives. I think it said over 1 million panels. It's basically gonna take the entire union to build it LUL
[6:32:14] vic_ave: dreadlords prolly have to die in Nether
[6:32:16] 1337RAIDS: bring back the OLD HEROES OF AZEROTH.
[6:32:19] EKS90_: @Towelliee this is on the wiki " Unknown (lore)" for Mal'ganis
[6:32:24] theDirtyon3: KEKW

[6:32:57] 91Niki: @dreamwalker213 Yeah it's gonna spread across multiple towns. It's nuts
[6:32:59] 1337RAIDS: they bring the chaos into the world, like YING / YANG, you need good + evil to be balanced.
[6:33:00] gusterugamer: and we don't know
[6:33:04] Inthezonewow: Primus dominated Jailer to be bad guy :)
[6:33:05] Sollice: Primus created Domination magic, but Jailer stole it and used it for bad
[6:33:06] Aidler: my money is on Danny to be the prime evil
[6:33:17] Serase: But The jailers Defeat was the Jailers Plan to Activate the Dragon Isle to get back is power KappaPride

[6:34:10] CCG_337: they should give me alpha/beta lol, just saying lol
[6:34:11] Sollice: It would not surprise me in the least bit if Denathrius comes back and says " What, you thought Zoval was the true evil? All part of my plan"
[6:34:17] Exxcar: @Towelliee makes me feel like our geared characters won't get ANYTHING from leveling
