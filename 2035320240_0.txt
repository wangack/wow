[1:46:03] Aevalous: 10 is best

[1:46:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @bloodstuck2000 he just stopped streaming or something?
[1:46:57] Knocktoff: 10 mans are good in scarcity or for small raids like bfd, bigger groups for bigger raids is fun
[1:47:03] Indomitablez: Indomitablez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! When do you think Mitch will pay me the 160g he still owes me? Maybe I should have been  a penny-stock and he would.

[6:41:21] vemodfu: @raylawn with mana regen there is a 5 second rule. every 5 second you get a little mana back if youre not at 100%. every spell you cast reset that 5 second time window down to zero. so at best you wait until the 5 second mana regen happens before you cast anything
