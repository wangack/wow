[2:59:45] NYCFinest718: Swifty you can also buy a used high-top amulette. It has the electric ramp in the back
[3:00:02] NYCFinest718: Lift not ramp

[3:00:22] Trollsaft: yeah but not the liftgate? :)
[3:00:23] Skkold: cybertruck?
[3:00:24] PeelsNFeels: Get EV truck
[3:00:29] drazener: instead of that tail loader, a trailer would be handier. Those loaders on pickup cant lift 2 much of weight, and those good ones are pretty expensive. Id choose a trailer ngl

[3:01:03] ZenoahTV: you should deffo incorperate your Swifty brand. That way your channel can push the branding. Pretty sure Staysafe and DrDisrispect do this type of sale. A dispender would look cool with your logo instead of Pepsi! lol
[3:01:05] unorth0dox: you need a truck with power
[3:01:06] russman989: and dully
[3:01:25] Cerberean_: Do NOT get an electric truck. They drain fast under heavy load
