[0:06:00] Istarimar: cool hair
[0:06:04] saga_no: Ooh - dig the hair! Very cool ombré
[0:06:10] kiuayoukai: Your sweater looks so comfty! <3
[0:06:12] Ujai321: Ah, so a carrot cake like an ogre
[0:06:14] jimmymidjinnilsson: im taking a beer and waiting for hockey
[0:06:41] kiuayoukai: Oh no! Hope the puppy feels better!
[0:06:59] anker_jym: Poor pup!
[0:07:00] wolfcloudchaser80: Aww, Moose is just having a run of bad luck these days.
[0:07:02] damnwalter: Any plans on playing HC Self-found?
[0:07:07] Octopixy1971: ahwww poor Mr Moosey <3
[0:07:31] McScooterson: oh dang, is it a leap year?
[0:08:08] GreenArrowed: makes gold making more interesting too since you're not making extra from AH
[0:08:09] Ujai321: Finally, a way to play wow without everybody CHEATING (ie trading and stuff)
[0:08:15] cashthb: henlo
[0:08:35] McScooterson: the most ujai of takes
[0:08:40] ibubblebear: got the mount yesterday and manuscript today officially done with it lol
[0:09:15] kiuayoukai: I bought my heartseeker mana ray today too! :D
[0:09:16] ibubblebear: 32 chars a day was getting tiring fast
[0:09:27] witchhobbit: hi!!!! i was so surprised i got the love rocket yesterday. the manuscript seems like a worst drop??!
[0:09:33] Ujai321: I couldn't tell you tbh. That chat had more layers than your carrot cake
[0:09:45] Krekk01: I wish holiday items like the manuscripts could either be bought for 50k gold, or dropped by the boss if you feel lucky
[0:09:53] Krekk01: it shouldn't one or the other
[0:09:55] darthduk: i got the armor this year but still no mount :(
[0:09:57] WhippWhapp: o/ Happy Valentines! @HazelNuttyGames  doing her part looking super cute! <3
[0:10:01] saga_no: The good news regarding Moose is that *most* dogs will have a brief period of upset tummy / adjusting around the age he is now - so he'll most likely be fine in not too long :)
[0:10:02] Zuldak: it must be nice getting the love rocket
[0:10:02] Krekk01: especially if you're super unlucky
[0:10:08] bethcryhiro: WoWhead says its 0.01% for the manuscript...Oof
[0:10:21] Ujai321: So, a business expense
[0:10:22] cashthb: I did notice it in the video!
[0:10:22] ibubblebear: love the hearthstone the most
[0:10:22] semideykevin: hi
[0:10:30] witchhobbit: yeah totally both options should be available
[0:10:35] saga_no: Most of the time it's to do with transitioning from "puppy" kibble to "adult" kibble
[0:10:46] delulu_4_u_boo: get that rockettt
[0:11:14] Daemavand: Its true, it is a lovely day
[0:11:19] Daemavand: Also greetings all
[0:11:20] kiuayoukai: The y grow so fast!
[0:11:29] nabilstendardo: I presume the manuscript is the same droprate than the heartbreaker. I got the former, still farming for the latter
[0:11:30] Zuldak: o____o
[0:11:34] Daemavand: Oh my!
[0:11:35] witchhobbit: how is the pup doing? we think it was just the growing pain bothering him?

[0:11:45] Ujai321: He's gonna stop at 100 at the earliest
[0:11:54] kryptogirrl: hello
[0:11:55] saga_no: My parents were told their dog(s) were preparing physically even before they were supposed to switch to adult food
[0:11:55] McScooterson: the question is, will he ever catch up to his paws
[0:11:57] Swordman117: Its hard to believe that your puppy isn't even a year old yet. So adorable
[0:12:02] Krekk01: I finally got my big rocket mount on the first day of the event this year, after so. Many. YEARS
[0:12:03] kryptogirrl: good afternoon / good morning
[0:12:07] kryptogirrl: good night
[0:12:30] Zuldak: dont forget boy's quest for his class order hall
[0:12:43] saga_no: So they had upset tummies when they were like 9-10 months old even if they hadn't swapped the food over yet
[0:12:58] saga_no: All dogs are different - but the vet said it was a common thing for most breeds
[0:13:10] kryptogirrl: how are you farming gold?
[0:13:24] Ujai321: Gorge, babes
[0:13:24] Krekk01: even the belt?
[0:13:28] Daemavand: That is a statement lol
[0:13:34] bethcryhiro: How does that work sorry putting gold into the shop?
[0:13:38] Daemavand: (I mean that in the best way possible)
[0:13:41] kryptogirrl: wheres the wings from? wow
[0:13:46] witchhobbit: love the wings and magical girl skirt combo
[0:13:52] Mortiie_: Boiled rice/chicken is always good for sick pups.

[0:14:30] ivashkov92: 💕
[0:14:30] witchhobbit: i would love to get more into gold making too
[0:14:51] cashthb: it still encourages them to make nasty things to sell tokens
[0:15:02] witchhobbit: @kryptogirrl the kyrian covenant!!!
[0:15:11] kiuayoukai: Rice helps for the upset tummy for dogs too I have learned
[0:15:11] jimmymidjinnilsson: rise are good for dogs stomic
[0:15:12] Daemavand: Aww thats sweet :D
[0:15:34] saga_no: Award for Best Dog Mom (and Dad) goes to Hazel and Mystery Partner.
[0:15:50] furiforever: 18 characters per day for love rocket, no luck...i did get the mount armor tho
[0:16:17] Zuldak: there was a post saying season 3 M+ is STILL going strong.
[0:16:30] kynlaeh: i did that for my pup and i wasn’t used to cooking chicken lol. but she had a tummy problem and turns out chicken was the problem so the chicken rice diet exacerbated it
[0:16:35] Zuldak: people gearing alts is the theory
[0:16:40] kynlaeh: now she’s a lamb girly
[0:16:42] furiforever: Cross realm Mythic raid probably helping with Alch being profitable still
[0:17:01] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm hoping that this is a sign that this expansion had good player retention numbers. I want them rewarded for making a good expansion.
[0:17:02] witchhobbit: i'm still doing mythics, did my first 18 the other day lol. so doing them very slowly
[0:17:03] delulu_4_u_boo: sweet catto themus62LoveHugHeart
[0:17:06] Zuldak: any thoughts to the class for SSF?
[0:17:07] Daemavand: Oh thats true thats soon!
[0:17:12] Ujai321: So what happened on Sunday?
[0:17:22] Ryok: on the 29th the 2nd part of the final fantasy 7 remake trilogy releases and i will just VANISH xD
[0:17:31] Daemavand: Ah fair, poor sleep is no bueno D:
[0:17:33] goplacidly56: hazelWave hazelWave
[0:18:08] cuddlehunter: Is it to late to start playing dragon flight or wait for the new expansion?
[0:18:12] cashthb: hunter is kinda cheating tho,
[0:18:18] McScooterson: oh yeah, that'll put you down for the count
[0:18:27] Ujai321: The double dip, very brave
[0:18:34] cashthb: you should play something cool like feral

[0:18:39] witchhobbit: i also get really exhausted and weird after the booster shots
[0:18:41] Daemavand: LOL
[0:18:55] kiuayoukai: Oh same! Covid and flu shots knock me down too. Feels like you got hit by a truck
[0:18:56] MackPlays: U know how to party
[0:19:02] russtrotter: i did the same combo a few months back and walked around like silverback all day with 2 sore arms
[0:19:09] goplacidly56: I'd never get two vaccines at once
[0:19:16] Daemavand: Sounds like a good day to cozy TF up with snacks and multiple documentaries :D
[0:19:24] delulu_4_u_boo: happy valentines Hazel themus62LoveHugHeart
[0:19:31] witchhobbit: that is a good reminder to get another booster for me haha
[0:19:46] Daemavand: Immunity is utterly fascinating. I think its interesting how some people get decked and others its no issue
[0:19:47] goplacidly56: Yes Happy Valentines Day!
[0:19:55] Ujai321: In the same arm? My god
[0:20:06] Daemavand: Aww yay!! That's awesome!
[0:20:09] delulu_4_u_boo: smart
[0:20:15] witchhobbit: yeah good idea
[0:20:23] Istarimar: big brain strat
[0:20:27] saga_no: Hubby woke me up today with the usual coffee and a box of chocolate hearts <3
[0:20:50] russtrotter: exactly date nights are best done in the most unconventional nights...
[0:20:58] delulu_4_u_boo: aww lol
[0:21:02] Ujai321: "I think it was a young man. Could have been an elderly woman or a bear, I wasn't looking"
[0:21:20] cashthb: i mean... that's why you give chocolate instead
[0:21:22] jack_fraust: Good Morning Hazel, love the hair today!!!!
[0:21:52] delulu_4_u_boo: window cats are the best thing to see when you're stressed and runing errands
[0:22:04] wolfcloudchaser80: Eye contact might lead to a conversation.
[0:22:05] Ujai321: Imagine they look back! How stressful
[0:22:08] delulu_4_u_boo: LOL i love that
[0:22:12] sinn141: if ur nosy and socially awkard get some sunglasses :D
[0:22:16] 7thSaga: 7thSaga watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 5 times in a row hype!
[0:22:21] jack_fraust: that logic checks out lol!
[0:22:22] cashthb: maybe it's judging you tho
[0:22:32] Ujai321: Or a Vision Pro
[0:22:35] Ujai321: Imagine
[0:22:38] kynlaeh: i woke up sick today so partner just door dashed me indian food for my lunch while he’s at work. it was so cute
[0:22:53] witchhobbit: omg yeah i started wearing sunglasses more and it does help the social anxiety
[0:22:53] jack_fraust: your cat is an exact copy of my Mr. Memows
[0:23:09] Ujai321: I was worried you would say "we have leftover sushi"
[0:23:32] Daemavand: omg lol
[0:23:40] Daemavand: what a time to be alive
[0:23:53] tempestmellinger1901: hiya
[0:24:09] tempestmellinger1901: tempestmellinger1901 watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! how r u
[0:24:27] jack_fraust: no way you ever ate leftover sushi!!!! lol
[0:24:29] cashthb: i never did anything dumb
[0:24:45] jack_fraust: cap
[0:24:49] Daemavand: I've eaten leftover sushi many times before, never had an issue, but I get how it can be somewhat risky
[0:25:05] Daemavand: uh oh
[0:25:06] RTSLightning: The Emerald Dream portal in Valdrakken isn't appearing for me ahhhh
[0:25:07] GreenArrowed: they're never cold enogh
[0:25:07] delulu_4_u_boo: never mess with hotel fridges yea
[0:25:12] jack_fraust: lol somewhat!!!!
[0:25:22] Ujai321: Heartbreaking
[0:25:34] TotallyNotRaien: id eat left over sushi, my laziness knows no bounds
[0:25:37] cashthb: as long as I don't see the worms the food is fine
[0:25:50] Ujai321: But you also didn't get to eat sushi, so that's a bummer
[0:25:54] jack_fraust: the preservative they use tht makes it able to eat sushi has a time limit as well lol
[0:26:00] jack_fraust: you are brave souls
[0:26:07] delulu_4_u_boo: i cant handle it if it has a weird texture or smell
[0:26:08] saga_no: That was what we were told in Japan too - ...don't even bother trying to save sushi. It's fresh food. To be eaten there and then. Anything left over is tossed.
[0:26:09] wolfcloudchaser80: The parasites might give you superpowers, like in that episode of Futurama!
[0:26:23] bethcryhiro: Educate a non-sushi eater, what is wrong with leftover sushi, it is rice and fish right?
[0:26:26] Ujai321: You know what I want to watch today, speaking of worms in food? Ratatouille
[0:26:27] delulu_4_u_boo: LUL
[0:26:31] jack_fraust: your gonna super powers alright lol
[0:26:33] Daemavand: Speaking of sushi, this is a good time to plug Jiro Dreams of Sushi
[0:26:39] jack_fraust: straight to the toilet
[0:26:51] saga_no: Granted - the portion size in Japan at a restaurant is *very* small so the chance of you ordering too much is slim to none
[0:26:53] bethcryhiro: Ah, I getcha!
[0:26:54] fallingupwards: I gave myself pretty severe food poisoning from an undercooked burger last summer and ever since I make sure they're very well done 💀💀
[0:26:56] Daemavand: You would really enjoy it
[0:26:58] aerissune: aerissune subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! In the chaos of life, it is always nice to have a cozy Hazel stream to look forward to.  Thank you for being so lovely and creating a great environment!
[0:26:58] Streamlabs: aerissune just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:27:05] cashthb: i'm sure there's a guy that likes warm sushi
[0:27:18] Daemavand: Yeah undercooked burgers are so not worth the roulette imo lol
[0:27:26] VoidAbyssTV: Is this how you make your gold in WoW?
[0:27:26] saga_no: Sushi is one of the few things I miss being able to eat
[0:27:39] Cloud1k: ice cold beer period
[0:27:42] Daemavand: Interestingly, when I was in Japan, I was served raw chicken at a special izakaya
[0:27:46] 7thSaga: jimblesDance BEER lol
[0:27:46] Daemavand: it was not great
[0:27:54] jack_fraust: beer is for women and kids hiding the fact they arnt 21 yet lol
[0:27:57] Ujai321: Wait, UK? Really?
[0:28:07] jamie_lee: I know you don’t eat beef, but I bought stew beef (raw) on Sunday and I looked at the package today and it says freeze or use by Feb 29. That seems like a really long time to keep uncooked/unfrozen beef in your fridge. Will cook immediately.
[0:28:31] jack_fraust: top shelf bourbon is were its at
[0:28:40] wolfcloudchaser80: I kinda miss fish, too. I can eat it... but my partner isn't a fan.
[0:28:42] delulu_4_u_boo: mmm
[0:28:47] cashthb: well 'm hungarian, that's not even close; btw I'm not a huge fan of beer... well I no longer drink, when I did I prefered it cold I guess
[0:28:51] kynlaeh: i once got food poisoning from shrimp at home and now i’m scared to cook it
[0:28:58] sinn141: does that mean u dont eat chicken ?
[0:29:09] cashthb: no idea
[0:29:13] delulu_4_u_boo: i dont like anything carbonated
[0:29:22] Daemavand: ...and I thought cash was American
[0:29:23] Daemavand: and IDK why
[0:29:35] jack_fraust: exactly
[0:29:38] Zilah_: I love beer but I’m celiac now so I can’t have it.
[0:29:44] Ujai321: It's an acquired taste
[0:29:47] Daemavand: ahahah I agree!!
[0:29:50] saga_no: Being allergic to fish (and nuts) is so sad... like I'll never be able to taste authentic South-East Asian dishes.
[0:29:50] kynlaeh: i don’t enjoy beer i’ve tried so hard but i can’t do it
[0:29:50] Ujai321: Like all alcohol
[0:29:56] Ryok: german here and i can't stand beer... also i heard NA people think we drink our beer warm because we don't drown it in ice cubes or ice cold fridges D:
[0:30:01] wolfcloudchaser80: I wasn't super into beer, but I've discovered that I like dark beers, oddly.
[0:30:03] witchhobbit: i prefer most alcohol over beer
[0:30:14] saga_no: I can get the allergy-friendly versions but those aren't *authentic* when the fish sauce, oyster sauce and peanuts are taken out
[0:30:17] kynlaeh: i like bleu cheese it’s delicious in a mac and cheese or a rustic grilled cheese
[0:30:24] ibubblebear: use to dislike sourcream as a kid
[0:30:27] witchhobbit: BUT i will take beer battered fried food any day
[0:30:42] Parazetamol91: nah just fridge is perfect
[0:30:43] Daemavand: I absolutely love how UK beer is just slightly below room temp, if not room temp - its different though since their stuff all comes from a cask
[0:30:45] Daemavand: most of the time
[0:30:47] fallingupwards: I can't stand warm beer. Ice cold
[0:30:49] cashthb: I don't mind the top half of the bottle, the bottom is really bitter tho
[0:30:49] jack_fraust: the reason they drink beer warmer is because the alcohol is absorbed faster
[0:30:49] Ujai321: *our presumed British friends
[0:30:50] Swordman117: I've never understood why beer needs to be an acquired taste.
[0:30:50] Ryok: our beer is still cold... it's just that NA fridges are colder than german ones
[0:31:01] kiuayoukai: I think that's the helm that drops off the metal knight in DMF
[0:31:05] delulu_4_u_boo: aoili is just flavored mayo
[0:31:10] saga_no: @HazelNuttyGames I never had an issue with mayo until I lived in the US... heh
[0:31:11] GreenArrowed: i only trust myself with mayo
[0:31:11] wolfcloudchaser80: @haleych My partner and I are going out today to a place that serves beer-battered french fries. Mmmmmmm
[0:31:13] sinn141: im the same but with ketchup
[0:31:14] aerissune: Hated mayo until I got pregnant with my first kid. Now obsessed with it.
[0:31:19] saga_no: Hellman's mayo is *WEIRD* compared to what I'm used to
[0:31:22] legendarism: happy v day sweet hazel :) <3
[0:31:24] jack_fraust: when we were teens we would slam or shotgun warm beer to get a buzz quicker
[0:31:26] averageteacup: streamers talking about food, makes me hungry everyday :D
[0:31:27] archermoo: Cellar temp is the UK standard. Colder than room temp, but not actually cold. I'm in Ireland, and it is pretty much the same here.
[0:31:36] cashthb: scarlet is british I think
[0:31:50] bethcryhiro: From England here, everyone I know who likes beer have it from the fridge not room temp but I dont drink so idk haha
[0:31:52] Ujai321: It's about as late as it is for Germans. Or Hungarians.
[0:31:54] jack_fraust: the warmer the beer the faster you get drunk
[0:32:02] silverstitcher: I'm british but I don't drink beer
[0:32:16] delulu_4_u_boo: that cat loves you so much ddameCry
[0:32:22] wolfcloudchaser80: There's more than one Scarlet-named person here, though... I think one of them is Canadian.
[0:32:23] Daemavand: Will be heading to the EU in a couple of weeks for a short trip and I'm way to excited about having their beer again lol
[0:32:29] TotallyNotRaien: i finally got blackfuse bombling to drop from SoO
[0:32:30] 7thSaga: got my coffee and i added sugar and French Vanilla Cream   :)
[0:32:47] Timetaco: whoah. did they recently increase the amount of characters you can have on a realm?
[0:32:54] saga_no: I suppose I'm the odd one out; the only beer I'll drink once in a blue moon is Guinness LUL
[0:33:04] saga_no: and I'll have it cold
[0:33:04] GreenArrowed: they are much cleaner than mine
[0:33:32] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no lol, and there's an American beer brand called "Blue Moon"
[0:33:37] Timetaco: sweeet
[0:33:44] archermoo: Mostly I drink whiskey, and usually room temp. 🙂
[0:33:45] TotallyNotRaien: just 50? feels so low
[0:33:47] cashthb: not that I think about it, I might have told some questionable story from London
[0:34:00] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Is it... the LaCroix of beer like most American beers? LUL
[0:34:05] vampire_enthusiast: I think it was Shadowlands Pre-patch or around there when they made it so you could have all your toons on one server
[0:34:06] Ristvakbaen1911: Phial market seems way too screwy atm x.x Feels hard to turn a profit
[0:34:26] Ryok: the only times i drank beer (and wanted to puke every sip) was when i was at family parties while i was 16/17... so old enough for beer but too young for stuff i actually kinda liked xD
[0:34:31] saga_no: Drinking culture here in Norway is absolutely insane and you get weird looks or asked if you're pregnant (if you're packin' a uterus) if you decline alcohol in ANY circumstance
[0:34:33] 6thbiscuit: I'm in UK - sorry this is a bit late! NA beer = UK lager (deffo cold); UK beer = NA ?? ale, I guess?
[0:34:36] saga_no: So here I am very much the odd one out LUL
[0:34:36] ibubblebear: i feel like it is just people not caring so much like it isnt a huge deal
[0:34:47] Timetaco: in my previous industry not drinking is still looked at as weird, which is partially why i left
[0:34:51] fallingupwards: I keep forgetting to do the weekly dig stuff lol no one ever does it on my server so it's like a ghost town event
[0:34:57] Terra___l: blizzard changed the archive world quest they can be done with alts without doin the pre quests
[0:35:21] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Hm, I think it's one of the wheat beers. Fairly approachable to a wide audience. I like Guiness too, though. And a local dark beer called Ellie's Brown.
[0:35:25] saga_no: The stereotype / meme is that Norwegians are extreme introverts and super shy ...until you get them drunk. Like they won't dance at the club unless drunk.
[0:35:31] 7thSaga: i drink Taanka Vodka like twice a month :)
[0:35:32] witchhobbit: i feel like i have to avoid parties and hang outs where people drink because i feel the social pressure to drink as well. not that people actually pressure me to drink
[0:35:35] anker_jym: Hazel, are you telling me you're NOT an alcoholic??
[0:35:44] Ristvakbaen1911: Are there any good rewards from the Archive events?
[0:35:56] Terra___l: last two times all 3 were with the tokens
[0:35:57] TotallyNotRaien: her addictions lie elsewhere
[0:36:00] jack_fraust: in a 12 year military career i made it to 27 different countries and had beer from all over the world and it all ended up tasting pretty much the same after a while
[0:36:05] kynlaeh: as a young 20’s male, i find that people think it weird when i decide i don’t wanna drink on a particular evening. i find it strange cuz  just don’t wanna drink lol
[0:36:26] Daemavand: @saga_no An old friend of mine is NOrwegian and the craziest nights out I've had in my life were all with her lol
[0:36:38] furiforever: Oh i forgot to tell you, I got Midnight from RISE quantum thingy
[0:36:41] cashthb: scotch is literally the worst tasting booze besides weird stuff
[0:36:42] justmyers: good morning Hazel!
[0:36:43] Ujai321: Do you like, drink wine at home?
[0:36:45] saga_no: @Daemavand Yup. We go from 0 to 100 real fast...
[0:37:16] Ujai321: I found that I cannot absorb the bad decisions as well
[0:37:25] delulu_4_u_boo: yeah your body doesnt tolerate what it used to
[0:37:27] Ujai321: So I have to be increasingly vigilant
[0:37:29] delulu_4_u_boo: same w/drinking
[0:37:34] goplacidly56: i have trouble with this relics task
[0:37:40] 7thSaga: not if you keep drinking Kappa Lol
[0:37:44] Timetaco: same. in the first year or so of the pandemic i was very unhealthy and my body hated me for it. last two years have been much better
[0:37:57] kynlaeh: i think i remember you mentioning this several new years agos but you said you would drink and then get sick ish the next day and i feel that same way i always get a cold
[0:37:57] fallingupwards: I hate having to pee every 30m when I drink 😂
[0:38:07] delulu_4_u_boo: LUL
[0:38:08] jack_fraust: @7thSaga lololololllololo
[0:38:11] saga_no: @Daemavand People 'round here find me terrifying because I'll dance (literally) on the table or whatever if mood strikes - while only having drunk water the entire night... I do what they "need" a few beers to do while sober, and people don't like that.
[0:38:15] Daemavand: I'm nearly 38 years old with an advanced degree and a good job and still drink boxed wine lol :D
[0:38:20] wolfcloudchaser80: I don't know if it's an urban  legend or not, but I've heard red wine in particular causes headaches.
[0:38:23] delulu_4_u_boo: takes me like 3 months for my metabolism to recover now
[0:38:26] Ryok: i have that with staying up past 4 am... the whole next day just doesn't exist because i sleep like 12 hours, am awake for 3-4 and then sleep another 8 xD
[0:38:27] Lumimyrsky: @fallingupwards Ah yes, the notorious "party-bladder" LUL
[0:38:30] delulu_4_u_boo: from 1 night of drinking LOL
[0:38:37] Daemavand: @saga_no Thats too bad you sound fun lol
[0:38:49] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Depends on the wine; wine with lots of tannins will give more headaches
[0:38:56] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Woot! Have a very wonderful day Miss Hazel!
[0:38:56] Streamlabs: beorn_of_the_northernsea just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:39:15] necroticlolxd: I want legion classic (on 7.3 patch)
[0:39:15] Rudric_Ice: as a 28yr old i hate drinking alcohol im okay with cocktails here n there but like wine,beer and hardcore alcohol drinks i just hate it im okay with my soda
[0:39:28] witchhobbit: yeah that's why i prefer my occassional gummy or chocolate LUL
[0:39:44] cashthb: people usually drink for a reason tho, sometimes you prefer the sickness over the thoughts
[0:39:47] saga_no: To be clear, though, ....the grand total of alcohol units of any kind I've consumed the past 10 years is ... 0.5.
[0:39:58] delulu_4_u_boo: life is fun in your own little world cartoo57Toonheart
[0:40:03] Lumimyrsky: I quit drinking a lot when I was 22 already (almost 37 now). I can still go and get tipsy/drunk but it's like once every 3 months or so.
[0:40:04] Daemavand: Amen to that. "Things are funny" I agree <32
[0:40:14] jack_fraust: Hazel always a pleasure dear, have to get to class and spend my hard earned VA benefits have a blessed day as always till tommorow
[0:40:26] kynlaeh: as i’ve gotten older i find it more fun to people watch than to do the activity, example: drinking lol
[0:40:26] Lumimyrsky: So alcohol isn't an issue, but if I eat deepfried food.. Oh my god LUL
[0:40:30] delulu_4_u_boo: bye jack
[0:40:33] jgbrit: Hi Hazel! HeyGuys
[0:40:36] saga_no: These days I just blame my diagnoses or meds when I decline alcohol and if people pry (and they do) - I tell them "Well........ alcohol doesn't mix well with *antipsychotics* ..." which is technically true, and hilarious to watch the person get horrified.
[0:40:36] Zuldak: just replace sweet coco with baking coco Kappa
[0:40:41] Daemavand: The world is amazing and full of wonder
[0:40:43] Daemavand: is my saying
[0:41:02] fallingupwards: I love watching the squirrels in our neighborhood. They're very cute
[0:41:12] white_catz: pink hair for valentines day? ^^
[0:41:40] Zuldak: i have a bone to pick with a local squirrel. They like to sit on a branch over my car and eat nuts and it covers my car in shells
[0:41:44] Ristvakbaen1911: Don't let him know that lol
[0:41:58] jgbrit: Great thanks, I'm off this week. Just been for dinner at a pub in Manchester that backs onto the runway so you can watch the planes take off right next to you while you have dinner! So much fun
[0:42:08] Terra___l: sorry i meant archive fragments  my english is so bad today
[0:42:28] Terra___l: all 3 stay on fragments
[0:42:50] TotallyNotRaien: shells are better than bird poop honestly
[0:42:59] Rudric_Ice: so hazel dragonflight is officially over what are your thoughts on the expansion as a whole
[0:43:37] Daemavand: @jgbrit Where is this if I may ask? I may be in Manchester later this year
[0:43:40] Zuldak: pollen season is also coming... gives my car a yellow tint
[0:44:23] Zuldak: TWW was supposed to be out this year? Season 4 is gonna be pretty small?
[0:44:24] cashthb: I dislike the hat, they aren't australian, why are they wearing it, wtf?!
[0:44:43] jgbrit: @daemavand it's called 'The Airport'. If you search Airport pub manchester you'll see it
[0:44:52] jgbrit: It's by Terminal 3
[0:44:56] Ristvakbaen1911: I"m a little disappointed there wasn't a 4th raid
[0:45:27] eielwind: hello! missed streams for awhile, what are we working on
[0:45:31] Hippwn: Yesterday I got on the hunter and started working on the tomes that teach you other pet families  you can tame didn't realize there were so many of those I did not have
[0:45:39] Terra___l: dragonflight feels like an filler expansion
[0:45:40] jgbrit: @daemavand you can see it on Google Maps
[0:45:40] erinnightz: hazelWave hazelLurk
[0:45:49] fallingupwards: The fated raids are ok but I would have liked a new zone/raid
[0:45:50] Zuldak: there is speculation that plans changed mid DF because
[0:45:57] Zuldak: Iridicron was set up to be the big bad
[0:46:12] 7thSaga: Hazel where do you get the Archieves dailies?
[0:46:18] jgbrit: Did you just say Archivist Codex? NotLikeThis
[0:47:03] Ristvakbaen1911: Not an unfair opinion tbh
[0:47:12] Rudric_Ice: when do we expect the expansion to release august ?
[0:47:17] Terra___l: it is the right cave
[0:47:34] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:47:48] witchhobbit: it's the opposite for me with content, feels like there's so much to do and making it go by faster is a lil scary LUL
[0:48:27] vampire_enthusiast: people are guessing Late August, early September
[0:48:42] Ristvakbaen1911: I'm really really hoping that they re-work Archeology in the coming expac.
[0:48:45] Fausstty: Hello. Have a lovely day miss
[0:48:59] Timetaco: quick question, are you using default plater or do you use a specific profile?
[0:49:11] kynlaeh: i’m sad to have to sit out war within since my accelerated masters will run the duration of it but i’m stoked to be done in time for midnight
[0:49:33] jgbrit: I've just started levelling a BM Hutner in Shadowlands, it's my first time on this account so I need to do eye of the jailer 😂
[0:50:14] white_catz: my plater profile is ur profilet oo haha just a bit tweaked
[0:50:22] GreenArrowed: @jgbrit nooooo
[0:50:28] jamie_lee: what is plater?
[0:50:39] eielwind: do you know if the only way to get love tokens is to do 2 dailies and the SFK boss?
[0:50:40] wolfcloudchaser80: I don't know why Foreground Kitty is just so entertaining for me.
[0:50:45] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatCat
[0:50:47] witchhobbit: LUL
[0:50:48] Daemavand: hahahahahahaha
[0:50:53] GreenArrowed: i love when she just pops up
[0:51:00] Daemavand: I love cat chaos
[0:51:05] Saiyori: all is cat
[0:51:09] jamie_lee: ahhhhh ok
[0:51:43] delulu_4_u_boo: themus62CatHeartLove
[0:52:14] Terra___l: hard work  doin the archive WQ`S  10 times...
[0:52:46] anker_jym: Maybe she wants a turn playing WoW lol
[0:52:51] witchhobbit: hazelLurk
[0:53:53] Zuldak: i vaguely remember a study saying petting a cat stresses them out... and people ridiculed it
[0:54:15] Zuldak: cause cats can demand pets and attention
[0:54:25] MrIlluminOttey: mrillu1Aryalove  Kitty
[0:54:34] NordicSorcerer: Seems I came by at the right moment. KITTEH! <3 <3 <3
[0:54:45] Zuldak: like excessively
[0:54:52] wolfcloudchaser80: Maybe scientific studies stress out cats.
[0:54:55] witchhobbit: overstimulate?
[0:54:56] Zuldak: overstimulated yeah
[0:55:11] anker_jym: Eustress is a thing. Positive stress
[0:56:12] Lluksobad: Lluksobad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! \o/
[0:56:12] Streamlabs: lluksobad just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:56:15] saga_no: Ohai @NordicSorcerer
[0:56:38] NordicSorcerer: Hi, @saga_no. Popped by just as the kitteh visited. :)
[0:56:42] jgbrit: Oh no is he still poorly
[0:56:46] saga_no: Hehe
[0:57:06] anker_jym: I might've missed it earlier, but I think I got enough context clues from chat. Did you take Sunday off because you got shots?
[0:57:09] darthduk: there's a script you can run that i found in the wowhead comments that shows you how close you are to it.
[0:57:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Sounds like a Victorian era name. Eustress Richmond-Talrond. Of the Coventry Richmond-Talronds.
[0:57:43] Timetaco: If you had to pick only one of your characters to play for the rest of the xpac, which would you pick?
[0:57:47] Timetaco: @wolfcloudchaser80 lol
[0:58:08] saga_no: Has the vet suggested having Moose tested for allergies?
[0:58:21] saga_no: or intolerances, rather - given upset tummy
[0:58:24] Rudric_Ice: btw hazel whats your thought on priest's oracle hero spec ?
[0:58:49] heldtheline: I have no life; I do all the world quests. I have an obsession for clearing the map.
[0:59:01] kynlaeh: do you still give moose bully sticks? my husky mix puppy decided a more effective way to consume it was to swallow it whole rather than chew on it lol
[0:59:16] zannuss: I used to do all the wq back in season 1 for rep
[0:59:19] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Oh hey, Saga has mentioned you play MS Flight Sim.... tried the new Dune Ornithopter yet?
[0:59:47] Ristvakbaen1911: They're making the buff go on a random person for it, no?
[0:59:50] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Not yet, has the dune pack been released?
[0:59:57] GreenArrowed: i hope the other option is much better and they take the feedback into consideration for oracle
[1:00:13] kynlaeh: yeah i saw that at the store the next trip and i was like wow i wish i woulda known lol
[1:00:42] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Just yesterday! If you like aerobatic or odd aircraft, the new toy is an absolute blast.
[1:01:03] kynlaeh: luckily she threw it up like10 min later on the way to the ER vet
[1:01:08] saga_no: Heh. I remember the first time my parents' first dog got his first moose femur... it's a *HUGE* bone. Dog held the bone between his paws and just clipped the ball-joint clean off the top of it... one chomp.
[1:01:15] jgbrit: I tried follower dungeons for the first time today. They're SO slow. The tank pulls literally every mob and the followers take ages to kill anything
[1:01:16] Curufin_: maybe it will be like the seasons buff that holy palas get
[1:01:17] Ristvakbaen1911: Ahh makes sense
[1:01:19] TotallyNotRaien: its dumb that it gives a damage buff when you have to wait for to pick the right one, peoples cd rotation would be over by then
[1:01:34] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 My fav for "just relaxing" is actually the TL Ultralight Sting S4 (Nimble, yet stable)
[1:01:35] Kaseyfullofjoy: Kaseyfullofjoy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Happy vday<3
[1:01:35] Streamlabs: kaseyfullofjoy just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:01:46] Daemavand: I feel like the followers dungeon is still very much in beta test mode and subject to tweaking
[1:01:48] kynlaeh: i think it requires too much for me personally
[1:02:01] kynlaeh: it’s the cycle every 1 second for me that i am not happy with
[1:02:07] TotallyNotRaien: it should just give basic CDR like blessing of autumn, that way it doesnt go to waste and it helps dps out
[1:02:08] sence_00: I heard they had a "less ambitious" version theyd consider based on feedback
[1:02:13] watchCrimson: you are my go to raid guide person, but I was wondering, ever gonna make Fyrak guide?
[1:02:16] sence_00: cuz ya the gameplay of it sounds insane
[1:02:50] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Ah, sounds like my take on the Vans RV-10 or 14, simple, easy to fly, and good in small airports.
[1:03:49] TotallyNotRaien: the concept of it would be cool as a self buff for something like monk with all the different celestials themes
[1:04:01] watchCrimson: good people, can somebody PM me link to the list of dragonflying mounts comming with prepatch?
[1:04:15] Rudric_Ice: TWW is gonna be such a QOL expansion can finally access the whole bank across all your characters :)
[1:04:33] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:04:34] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames I know you mentioned not typically watching other streamers content but Talisen and some of the Disc Priest Discord had an interview recently T&E posted on their  channel all about it.
[1:04:44] eielwind: is it worth doing love is in the air dungeon after first one of the day? not really right?
[1:04:44] TotallyNotRaien: its yanking on your pony tail
[1:05:03] TotallyNotRaien: if youre desperate yes
[1:05:21] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Starting the lengthy update download now. ;)
[1:05:28] jgbrit: The only solution is obviously delete gnomes from the game entirely LUL
[1:05:37] 7thSaga: i havnt gotton the Love Rocket in decades and i have my doubts this year :(
[1:05:38] jeffdmk: never tell me the odds
[1:05:47] witchhobbit: i'm needing my main to be a human, just less mog issues all around lol
[1:06:00] Gurottesquex: It kinda looks like a bird house
[1:06:02] witchhobbit: all the gnome alts tho
[1:06:09] MurdokkAF: Kul Tirans don’t have that issue. those ladies are thick.
[1:06:22] kynlaeh: thats why i am a human priest too the mog is important to me
[1:06:26] TotallyNotRaien: theres kultiran females?
[1:06:37] watchCrimson: knowing my self, my odds are worse then what they programed in
[1:06:38] peepofade: have you ever wanted to try or have tried other mmos? :3
[1:06:57] saga_no: This is why I main a Nelf... ;P But I rarely if ever use off-hands though
[1:07:07] kynlaeh: i like my gnome mage tho i think mage mog looks great on gnomes
[1:07:16] anker_jym: Cries in Shadow Priest
[1:07:18] alex_klutch: Priest and mage have some of the best mogs
[1:07:31] kynlaeh: i love the new glyph of shadow
[1:07:34] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Ah, yeah... that can take a while. And the aircraft might be a separate download from the marketplace (still free, though)
[1:07:38] saga_no: New Glyph is definitely a huge improvement
[1:07:40] witchhobbit: both my main mage and priest are gnomes atm
[1:08:11] witchhobbit: my mage went from a night elf to a human to a gnome LUL
[1:08:14] anker_jym: The new glyph does help, true. Priests definitely have some of the best sets in Dragonflight
[1:08:15] saga_no: I'm basic, though, and 99% of the time my mog is "leggings + UGGs" with a top and staff to match
[1:08:19] witchhobbit: she decreased in size
[1:08:25] kynlaeh: i still would love the idea of like shadow ravens tho as an alternate to shadow form but i still am grateful for the new glyph
[1:08:26] GreenArrowed: i've never had the urge to switch
[1:08:33] GreenArrowed: i remember when rift came out i just wanted to play both
[1:08:46] peepofade: did you make a lalafell when you played final fantasy 14?:D
[1:08:50] saga_no: I for whatever reason prefer my priest in pants rather than dresses or skirts so "leggings + UGGs" it is LUL
[1:08:52] eielwind: last epoch here soon looks good
[1:08:53] MurdokkAF: what do you think is the most unused Gender/race/class combo?
[1:08:57] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Yeah. 1.86GB "main" update, before I even get to the marketplace stuff (And I have the "premium", which means I get packages double the size or something... :P )
[1:08:58] kiuayoukai: I have never had the urge to switch or to even take a break from WoW because I always find something to do in WoW
[1:09:03] sence_00: omg, I finally hit the 1600 pets achieve...time to find something new for my life to be about haha
[1:09:05] GreenArrowed: it was supposed to be huge
[1:09:11] GreenArrowed: yea it was supposed to be the wow killer
[1:09:13] kynlaeh: i likes rift but was still happy with wow
[1:09:13] GreenArrowed: and it absolutely wasn't
[1:09:25] Rudric_Ice: i loved GW2 i still play it sometimes
[1:09:25] Perkolate: I had high hopes for wildstar, was even the first mmo where i planned to main a healer
[1:09:37] NordicSorcerer: @saga_no, will my smoking hot waifu join me for a smoke? <3
[1:09:41] Vakko_J: I liked new world, the crafting and gathering was fun.
[1:09:45] saga_no: lmao - sure ;P
[1:09:47] kynlaeh: i think so? or at least i haven’t heard anything about it in a while
[1:09:59] likertwo: The mmo i remember enjoying the early days of was the Conan MMO, the intro was like an old Bioware style choose your adventure quests and then after 20, all the voice acting was gone, the quests were all just kill X thing.
[1:10:06] Saiyori: riot is still working on their mmo
[1:10:08] GreenArrowed: i also played star wars the old republic for a while bc i'll do star wars anything, but it just couldn't compare to WoW
[1:10:10] eielwind: I loved FF14 but to do everything I wanted I couldn’t do both that and wow at all
[1:10:15] NotOut: I like the wig ^_^
[1:10:16] Kaseyfullofjoy: Temperamental to keep lol <3
[1:10:23] heldtheline: RPGs for a while were on the downtrend, I'm hoping BG3's success sees a resurgence.
[1:10:26] anker_jym: I wish they would revitalize SWTOR
[1:10:27] Starryskys: Rift is still active it seems
[1:10:30] witchhobbit: i'm really looking forward to the league mmo tbh! i'm just so curious how they'll do it and if it will be a success
[1:10:50] mcxoney: im really excited for the riot mmo!
[1:10:59] vampire_enthusiast: I like FFXIV, but there's nothing to do after the story except for Raid.
[1:11:01] likertwo: Did you ever play City of Heroes ?
[1:11:05] peepofade: did you make a lalafell (the small people race) when you played final fantasy 14?:D
[1:11:06] GreenArrowed: rift and swtor are free to play
[1:11:06] Rudric_Ice: you played GW2 ?
[1:11:11] kynlaeh: i tried eso but it was very story focused and i’m one to follow story
[1:11:12] GreenArrowed: city of heroes!
[1:11:12] TotallyNotRaien: excited for the riot mmo in 2032!
[1:11:17] rubibeya: My husband and mother in law still play everquest
[1:11:17] ravenstarr: i liked star wars the old republic, played rift initially. eve online?
[1:11:19] GreenArrowed: i played for a week
[1:11:26] fallingupwards: I've never had a mmo capture my attention like wow has but ffvix is really fun lol played for a month
[1:11:27] witchhobbit: i called it league mmo sairaLUL  riot* lol
[1:11:36] Chalis21: ashs of creation seems like it could be interesting
[1:11:45] anker_jym: But Hazel, did you ever play the king of MMO's, Raid: Shadow Legends???
[1:11:47] jeffdmk: I wonder if the wow audience does not take the bait on micro transactions as much as other gaming audiences
[1:11:58] Xannah08: yup Pantheon
[1:12:00] witchhobbit: is 2032 the actual release date lol
[1:12:11] TotallyNotRaien: lol no
[1:12:12] saga_no: brb
[1:12:16] TotallyNotRaien: no release date afaik
[1:12:30] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:12:59] sence_00: I have vague concerns about what happens to wow AFTER the world soul saga
[1:13:02] lumaday: is there anything special for maxing out rep with Soridormi?
[1:13:28] likertwo: Talking to my friends, yeah they take the bait lol dangle a new mount and they will buy it
[1:13:48] Kurama__95: The older the audience, the easier it is to take the bait, cuz why not?
[1:13:48] TotallyNotRaien: are wow tokens not micro transactions? and people buy tons of those
[1:14:13] heldtheline: And I think the fact that the sub price is relatively low, given the value, so spending a bit more on cosmetics isn't breaking the bank.
[1:14:17] retromantra: time poor ._.
[1:14:21] Nimiar: "Time is money, friend!"
[1:14:27] jgbrit: The only newish game that's got me excited is Elden Ring. My PC couldn't handle it though so I'll get it when I get a PS5

[1:16:08] TotallyNotRaien: freehold freehold!
[1:16:18] Kurama__95: The TWW pre-patch purgatory is really cutting into my WoW time. When I think "what do I wanna do?" Transmog farming is not on the table anymore hazelCry
[1:16:29] anker_jym: I'm surprised they haven't introduced "the Timeless" or "the Timeless One" as a title this expansion. It would be a cool one.
[1:16:39] jgbrit: And what do you think?

[1:19:24] vampire_enthusiast: They did say that, but it was only the IP itself being shelved
[1:19:27] jgbrit: I LOVE the 'transmog' in Elden Ring

[1:25:14] Perkolate: hey whats up, new here. is this the hearthstone mmo? how is it.
[1:25:15] Zuldak: @anker_jym the mage tower streams, especially the twins challenge, was a lot of silence and very close to outbursts of colorful language
[1:25:33] anker_jym: Ugh, I still don't have a new phone yet, so I can't download HS to do the anniversary stuff
[1:25:38] cashthb: or you could play the og warcraft 3 auto chess instead and poop talk bg casuals
[1:25:42] jgbrit: If I don't get Porcupette this reset I'm submitting a ticket. I've been doing the damn pet dailies 12 times daily on almost every continent of Azeroth for a month now.
[1:25:42] Xietra: what happened to palworld Hazel?

[1:28:49] jgbrit: 10.2.6 is the return of the Jailer, I told you this LUL
[1:29:04] Zuldak: my question: is the pirate thing going to be in booty bay, boralas or azshara? Someone suggested maybe that big cannon is finally being fired?
[1:29:09] jeffdmk: you are?
[1:29:11] saga_no: I refuse to be a grownup LUL
[1:29:18] Rudric_Ice: did u try phase 2 ?
[1:29:40] sence_00: I was wondering if 10.6 would be Brawlers Guild, or some oddball new faction
[1:29:45] sence_00: the speculation is killing me
[1:29:59] 7thSaga: LUL
[1:30:34] TotallyNotRaien: i hope its something with fun replayability
[1:30:37] cashthb: I hope it's a cash shop pirate set with no free stuff
[1:30:41] sence_00: I support the weird
[1:31:00] fallingupwards: I hope it's something that keeps people interested for more than 1 week lol
[1:31:01] sence_00: they said "community musings" were the inspo and I have no idea what that means
[1:31:10] Hulkhokie: i don't want any new currencies
[1:31:15] saga_no: Pirate Faction led  by ...that drunk dude we had to escort around this area in BfA
[1:31:22] heldtheline: it's supposed to be for both classic and retail so that limits things a bit, I think
[1:31:33] Seviander: Hazel perhaps a fan of the Vancouver Canucks? :D
[1:31:38] Rudric_Ice: new zone where u explore the other side of azeroth :O
[1:31:50] mordiell: i feel like its going to be that but with pirates LUL
[1:31:56] MikalasRaynor: The archives stuff reminds me wayyyy to much of the hated archeology.
[1:32:02] cashthb: Flynn, I don't think Mathias is cool enough to drink
[1:32:03] saga_no: I don't remember - whomstever gets snagged by the siren and then we have to escort him around the little hilly area next to this dungeon
[1:32:09] Seviander: HERESY!
[1:32:10] jeffdmk: but it is your heritage
[1:32:22] anker_jym: New Garrisons that you can build...in the Shadowlands. But you can only build one building a week, for the next 12 weeks
[1:32:24] TotallyNotRaien: it better be cannon
[1:32:25] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:32:26] witchhobbit: i thought we liked the oilers
[1:32:27] saga_no: Yeh Flynn - I think it was Flynn
[1:32:28] cashthb: yeah, they did, or do I guess
[1:32:28] heldtheline: they're living together in Stormwind now <3
[1:32:38] anker_jym: Yes, Flynn and Mathias are a couple
[1:32:43] TotallyNotRaien: cute

[1:33:30] cashthb: Mathias is the like the head of the cia, he prolly has more gold than you can imagine
[1:33:45] WhippWhapp: Steve Yzerman
[1:33:47] sence_00: as a Torontonian, I root for Canuks for that reason...plus the whale logo is awesome
[1:33:50] Seviander: Grew up playing against the Honey Badger himself, Jannik Hansen >.<, just a pestilence to play against, but just a joy to see play with the Canucks
[1:33:53] Kaseyfullofjoy: sounds like my demand avoidance lol
[1:34:06] WhippWhapp: Red wings have an awesome logo
[1:34:13] Seviander: It is
[1:34:24] eielwind: i never thought hazel would be discussing sports lol
[1:34:33] anker_jym: I never thought I would hear sports talk on a Hazel stream lol
[1:34:35] jgbrit: The horde Quest text for Love is in air Getaway Portal is quite cute. I think the quest giver by the portal fancies the undead you get the flowers for
[1:34:43] witchhobbit: as an american, i'd take almost any other sport over american football
[1:34:45] sence_00: oh ya that riot was outrageous
[1:34:51] saga_no: Meanwhile, I'm over here rootin' for the Pittsburgh teams for no other reason than having lived in Pittsburgh - no earthly idea how they're doing in their respective sports whatsoever LUL
[1:34:57] Seviander: He was named Honey Badger because it was such a tenacious forward for would dog down and work the dirty areas of the ice
[1:34:59] Hulkhokie: I live in Los Angeles and basically no one is from here, so there are a TON of "out of town" fans who grew up elsewhere (including me)
[1:35:26] Daemavand: Aye, sports bring out a lot of emotions in people
[1:35:29] witchhobbit: we could call american football "new football" just like new england
[1:35:31] fabianovassao: cheers from france
[1:35:40] supashanka: Pittsburgh teams are just pure suffering
[1:35:49] saga_no: Winter Olympics as a Norwegian is just ...boring.
[1:35:49] Daemavand: Its often very closely tied to peoples identities which is why there can be such strong bonds formed
[1:35:58] saga_no: "OH look ..another Gold... woohoo........"
[1:36:11] cashthb: is canada any good in sports in general?
[1:36:19] Seviander: Toronto core 4 = apocalyptical tier suffering
[1:36:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Ice hockey.
[1:36:33] Hulkhokie: @saga_no I grew up in DC, Pittsburgh hockey made me suffer for almost 3 decades
[1:36:37] fabianovassao: hockey
[1:36:38] eielwind: oh right olympics are this year
[1:36:42] saga_no: @supashanka All the more reason for me to root for them, honestly...

[1:37:44] Seviander: oh, summer olympics.......don't watch :P
[1:37:57] saga_no: @Hulkhokie I honestly have zero clue how they're doing... I'm not much of a sports person, but because I lived in Pittsburgh for a year as a kid - I root for PGH teams :)
[1:38:18] jeffdmk: I wish rarity would count the number of times I have checked this vendor for rare mog
[1:38:20] GreenArrowed: expensive and annoying for locals
[1:38:26] supashanka: @fabianovassao thats fair enough haha
[1:38:32] CanadianHeavy: 2010??? dang I am old lol
[1:38:33] Daemavand: Yep and there was no snow and they had to helicopter in snow from the BC interior lol

[1:38:48] cashthb: I'm sure that will go well, I didn't hear about any problem with Paris recently :)
[1:38:58] Hulkhokie: @saga_no yea that was a reply fail :/
[1:38:59] anker_jym: Okay, so this always confuses me. Vancouver is NOT on Vancouver island right?
[1:39:17] Rudric_Ice: paris is hell right now

[1:40:11] supashanka: @Hulkhokie the good ol white russian with no cup jokes?
[1:40:13] Leterius: the eagle?
[1:40:25] Seviander: Snowboarding down hill rush probably close to being hte most entertaining during winter olympics
[1:40:34] Hulkhokie: @supashanka WAY before that, starting in the 90s
[1:40:36] wolfcloudchaser80: Amateur ski jumper sounds like another term for "ER patient."
[1:40:39] Seviander: Swim?
[1:40:41] jgbrit: Rowing?
[1:40:41] kynlaeh: swim
[1:40:43] saga_no: Last time I heard anything about skijumping it was a bit of a whoopla in media regarding women wanting to compete

[1:42:25] KingfisherGames: got the love is in the air rocket mount this year
[1:42:43] Hulkhokie: @KingfisherGames congrats!
[1:43:04] heldtheline: someday Hazel is going to get so distracted by Moose snuggles that she'll forget she's streaming and Kira is going to take over hazelLurk
[1:43:07] saga_no: Not big on sports so I don't watch it ...if anything I'll look up stats later for the select few things I'm curious about
[1:43:45] saga_no: @GreenArrowed IIRC you're a fellow DnD nerd, yeah?
[1:43:46] kiuayoukai: I'm not a big sports fan myself
[1:43:49] jgbrit: I'm going to save up for the gold sink scarab. I must have it

[1:45:33] Ryok: that's i think... my 5th kill on hc merodyHmm but i think that'll be my last unless there's another slime cat thing in S4 because holy hell that fight is stressful xD
[1:45:41] witchhobbit: kira's grwm
[1:45:49] GreenArrowed: @saga_no yes!
[1:46:19] IAmScarlett__: hi hello bonjour hola ciao namaste
[1:46:37] saga_no: @GreenArrowed OK, so I'm going to play a Warlock with Chtulhu as their patron. Do you know if any/all Chtulhu lore is OK or should I try to find DnD specific lore?
[1:46:40] 7thSaga: lul hAZEL
[1:46:40] sence_00: How is Moose? Is his tummy ache totally gone (or whatever that was)

[1:48:27] wolfcloudchaser80: Foreground cat!
[1:48:30] GreenArrowed: @saga_no ooo, that's up to your dm. there are lovecraftian like creatures in dnd that could be your patron if you're not specifically playing a lovecraftian setting.
[1:48:41] heldtheline: that was a trip and a half last time
[1:48:54] forebringer: wonderful @anker_jym
[1:48:59] jgbrit: BFA had a nice soundtrack but Shadowlands was spine tinglingly epic
[1:49:05] Ryok: it's weird with that guy on the bridge... sometimes i can run STRAIGHT through him and not aggro him... and sometimes i aggro them 5 steps away D:
[1:49:17] saga_no: @GreenArrowed It's not a Lovecraftian setting - but Chtulhu was listed as one of the patrons you could have if you did Great Old One (which I did)
[1:49:53] GreenArrowed: @saga_no ah! i was about to say i'm almost certain star pact (which is great old ones) is cthulu-ish
[1:50:22] Ryok: DK can be a lot of fun but man i tried getting into unholy... WAY too many cds xD
[1:50:32] saga_no: @GreenArrowed Cool - thanks :) I'll see if I can dig up some DnD specific lore, then - just to be safe :)

[1:50:43] Daemavand: but you could get more neat pots for them!
[1:50:48] jeffdmk: Calling this spring appears to be trying to jinx things
[1:51:01] Zuldak: I think the beaver should be the official animal of valentines day. they always Chews you

[1:52:07] elliongrey: Doesn't it feel so good to dragon fly in other zones like BFA/ SL
[1:52:20] Rudric_Ice: frost DK is in a very bad place actually DK's in a whole are they need a rework badly
[1:52:21] jeffdmk: hazel after dark appears to be back
[1:52:31] eielwind: You have unspent dragonriding glyphs
[1:52:32] eielwind: :D
[1:52:41] KingfisherGames: @elliongrey the basic courses in the Outland Cup were extremely satisfying
[1:53:10] saga_no: Doesn't speak *much* anyway :)
[1:53:10] Blaizeria: He was also blackadder
[1:53:13] BoogiePonderosa: blackadder ftw
[1:53:14] Zuldak: If you like Rowan Atkinson his best work is Blackadder
[1:53:15] anker_jym: Imagine a Dragon Racing World Cup type deal, where the course was from the top of EK or Kalimdor, to the bottom.
[1:53:19] elliongrey: Oooo Are those still going on? I forgot to look int othose
[1:53:23] KingfisherGames: Rowan Atkinson's non-Bean work is incredible, if you haven't seen the WW1 series of Blackadder, you owe it to yourself
[1:53:24] zerbe: Glad to see you are still making boss guides. Got me up to speed after coming back recently.
[1:53:26] Ryok: weirdly enough since i unlocked normal flying in DF zones i've mostly done normal flying ^^' only if i have to get somewhere fast for like a key or something
[1:53:43] Zuldak: Blackadder is the last name of a family. It's a tv series about a family in various historical periods.
[1:53:50] Blaizeria: And of course Johnny English
[1:53:54] cashthb: you watched kungfury yet?
[1:53:55] GreenArrowed: if i'm going to watch a 3+ hr movie i'll watch lotr
[1:54:02] BoogiePonderosa: what's the portal add on again?
[1:54:10] KingfisherGames: oh, I got my red rose bouquet after only the second attempt on a boss that could drop it
[1:54:12] eielwind: Rat Race is a good time
[1:54:14] saga_no: Kung Fury is *hilarious*
[1:54:23] saga_no: only like 30 minutes long or whatever too
[1:54:25] cashthb: you could watch it on stream next time you get an early drop
[1:54:30] Zuldak: Bollywood movies?
[1:54:34] KingfisherGames: Thank you Queen Azshara, even if I had to relearn what my interrupt was on my Druid
[1:54:37] eielwind: RRR is *bonkers*
[1:54:38] jeffdmk: I found a use for old flying, dragon riding from darkshore to mount hyjal does not work well
[1:54:39] wolfcloudchaser80: Atkinson't stand-up bit where he's the devil was a good one, too
[1:54:51] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Toby is best boi.
[1:55:09] anker_jym: It's really interesting to watch interviews with Rowan Atkinson, because he's kind of actual genius, and he doesn't particularly like that Mr. Bean is his most well-known role.
[1:55:15] Ryok: @eielwind i love rat race... weirdly enough THAT is what i think of when i hear smash mouths all star xD
[1:55:38] Blaizeria: Best boi is reserved for fuecoco and Graha Tia :P
[1:55:40] eielwind: SAME @Ryok
[1:55:49] Rudric_Ice: RRR is ''kollywood'' bcuz it was made in south india
[1:55:54] 7thSaga: LUL i love Mr Bean
[1:55:55] BoogiePonderosa: 4 wedding and a funeral?
[1:56:00] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Yes! And the schoolmaster taking attendance bit, too.
[1:56:08] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Yup :D
[1:56:14] Zuldak: hugh laurie?
[1:56:19] Zuldak: aka dr house?
[1:56:23] Ysarahhh: love actually?
[1:56:29] Zuldak: oh O.o
[1:56:31] Ysarahhh: ahahaha
[1:57:00] stinkysteps: Does anybody need some luck? I just got Heartbreaker and the Heavenly onyx cloud serpent right after the other....LET'S GO SHARKBAIT!
[1:57:02] Zuldak: hes actually quite proud of mr bean
[1:57:19] cashthb: guess who I wanted to say?
[1:57:19] Kaseyfullofjoy: LOVE hugh
[1:57:19] Daemavand: Bob! It was bob!
[1:57:23] Blaizeria: Rat race?
[1:57:24] Ryok: @anker_jym i recently watched a video on him breaking down his "most famous" roles and it was really cool, it was johnny english, blackadder, mr bean and man vs bee (which i never even heard of before the movie but i'd love to see because it seems hilarious)
[1:57:38] KingfisherGames: There was also that hilarious bit during the Olympics in London where Rowan Atkinson, in character as Mister Bean, just pressed a single key on a keyboard over and over to participate in the rendition of Chariots of Fire
[1:57:47] Elrathir: but not that bob, the other bob, on the left
[1:57:50] anker_jym: Hazel, do you have a favorite comedian?
[1:57:53] saga_no: He actually appreciates how Mr Bean "works" everywhere in the world, despite being *SUPER* British - because it's so non-verbal as it is
[1:57:56] Hippwn: He also had a small part in the new willy wonka movie
[1:57:58] hannahgrams: rose matefeo
[1:58:00] saga_no: It also works for younger children for the same reason
[1:58:00] cashthb: we could also watch kung fury just saying
[1:58:02] elliongrey: Task master? That's Greg Davies. I love him so much
[1:58:03] Phenroi: bob's your uncle?
[1:58:10] KingfisherGames: wait, someone said Bob, are we talking about Dark Confidant from MtG?
[1:58:21] Elrathir: LUL that can be the problem with comedians
[1:58:28] Ryok: @saga_no yeah i saw a lot of people from like asia saying they grew up absolutely LOVING mr bean xD
[1:58:42] wolfcloudchaser80: Man, now I've got to go watch some old Mr. Bean.
[1:58:46] KingfisherGames: my favorite comedian is dead
[1:58:47] Blaizeria: Oh he was in four weddings and a funeral too
[1:58:47] Daemavand: Ellen Degeneres' stand-up I think is amongst my favorites
[1:58:49] 7thSaga: im hugnry but dont know what to eat and i went grocery shopping yesterday and bought a bunch of junk food LUL
[1:58:50] cashthb: just wanted to say that
[1:58:52] saga_no: @Ryok I did too :) Before I could speak or understand much English I watched Mr Bean on TV and loved it
[1:58:56] Daemavand: especially her oldschool stuff from the 80's
[1:59:36] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:59:39] Ryok: my favorite comedian is a german one probably barely anyone knows ^^' i don't think i have a favorite english speaking one
[1:59:49] Rudric_Ice: did you watch the mr bean animated series ?
[1:59:53] witchhobbit: i love ali wong a lot and i binged watched BEEF
[2:00:08] GreenArrowed: ali wong is great
[2:00:11] KingfisherGames: actually you know who's brilliant? Russel Howard is really funny and seems like a genuinely nice guy
[2:00:13] anker_jym: Ooh, never heard of them!
[2:00:35] cashthb: is it lost?
[2:00:44] Perkolate: Joe thomas was hilarious on task master
[2:01:08] Andersonmps: It is "Dope" the show?
[2:01:13] Rudric_Ice: you ever watched Russel peters hes pretty funny
[2:01:14] witchhobbit: phoebe waller-bridge, yes. she's everything
[2:01:20] saga_no: I'm old... my favorite comedians are Denis Leary and Bill Hicks
[2:01:25] IndigoCat: Taskmaster is awesome. My husband just sent me a Valentine Taskmaster clip LUL
[2:01:28] KingfisherGames: oh wow, i didn't realise Mock the Week had come to an end
[2:01:36] goplacidly56: Did you say you can mail the dig fragments to your other toons?
[2:01:42] fallingupwards: I have a hard time finding comedians I like lol
[2:01:47] Zuldak: the old Sean Connery from Celebrity Jeopardy was my favorite skit on SNL
[2:02:02] anker_jym: I'm American, and all my favorite comedians are non-American lol
[2:02:11] witchhobbit: fleabag is one of the best shows i've ever seen. possibly my favorite
[2:02:17] heldtheline: if you haven't seen the clips of Greg Davies on Graham Norton, you should, they're golden
[2:02:23] elliongrey: Yeah, british tv/comedians know how to comedy. Americans/Canadians just don't have the same level of humor.
[2:02:33] elliongrey: Graham Norton is fantastic
[2:02:42] Blaizeria: Sometimes comedians do that for added comedy
[2:02:43] Andersonmps: I like Chris Rock a lot. His specials on netflix are pretty good
[2:02:44] GreenArrowed: @Zuldak i think darrell hammond did that impersonation
[2:02:49] IndigoCat: @heldtheline The teacher stories are killer
[2:02:49] witchhobbit: @elliongrey don't say that about schitt's creek!!!!
[2:02:58] elliongrey: I'm also a big fan of the the great big quiz/big fat quiz of the year
[2:03:00] witchhobbit: schitt's creek was so good
[2:03:15] goplacidly56: Ahh thank you
[2:03:19] 7thSaga: i dont think i have a fav comedian actor but maybe Jim Carry in his earlie years LUL
[2:03:20] Blaizeria: I couldn't watch that
[2:03:20] elliongrey: @haleych oooh you're right. Schitts Creek is a bit of an anomaly for me haha
[2:03:24] saga_no: The comedians they have on QI: Quite Interesting tend to be good
[2:03:28] heldtheline: @IndigoCat yep, especially the, um, one with the hoh student
[2:03:36] KingfisherGames: @elliongrey i would pose george carlin as a counterargument
[2:03:43] witchhobbit: to be fair i think schitt's creek is the only comedian canadian show i now haha
[2:03:43] Blaizeria: Vapid teenagers are my kryptonite
[2:03:45] edohran: Love the hair color!
[2:03:49] witchhobbit: know*
[2:03:51] saga_no: QI is also just a fantastic show if you're into random fun facts about stuff....
[2:04:14] KingfisherGames: @saga_no yeah, btw has stephen fry guested on any episodes now that Sandy Totsvig is the host?
[2:04:14] IndigoCat: @heldtheline Yep. that one especially LOL
[2:04:31] KingfisherGames: @saga_no if you like QI, I need to also recommend Tom Scott's podcast Lateral
[2:04:34] witchhobbit: @elliongrey LUL
[2:04:37] saga_no: @KingfisherGames I don't know - I think he may have been a tad too busy with other stuff (like his books)
[2:04:39] Blaizeria: How I met your mother was my binge show
[2:04:39] Daemavand: There are way too many shows out there
[2:04:45] Daemavand: I'm still working through the Crown, slowly
[2:05:03] n0haxi: hey hazel have you maybe perhaps heard of a game called world of warcraft?
[2:05:09] Blaizeria: Oh the crown was another show I binged
[2:05:18] eielwind: I'm on a true crime binge
[2:05:22] saga_no: @KingfisherGames Big Fan of Tom Scott already - I can only watch him in small doses, though; He's a BIT hyper at times for me when speaking (it's just the way he speaks, but it sometimes overwhelms me)
[2:05:23] anker_jym: Are we entering Hazel's sportsball phase?
[2:05:30] witchhobbit: i think parks and rec is the best american one
[2:05:33] Rudric_Ice: did you watch the Vatican girl documentary ? its SO good
[2:05:39] itsparvati: the crown was good
[2:05:48] KingfisherGames: @saga_no that just reminded me that he used to do the harry potter audiobooks, and then i felt like i had to share that the full Inkheart trilogy is available on audible as read by Brendan Fraser
[2:06:01] anker_jym: That's what I meant don't worry lol
[2:06:20] Blaizeria: I appear to have retained my acorns balance
[2:06:27] saga_no: @KingfisherGames ...and this reminds me to inform people that Andy Serkis did a full audiobook series of The Hobbit, LotR and The Silmarillion - and it's SO GOOD
[2:06:29] jeffdmk: play things for fun who are you? if you dont 100% sportsball who are you?
[2:06:31] KingfisherGames: @saga_no each episode of Lateral has 3 guests in addition to him as the host, its a great format
[2:07:02] cashthb: I watched some zoomer youtuber "spar" with Sean Strickland, it made me want to try mma even more
[2:07:15] IndigoCat: @saga_no I've never been much of an audio book fan but that's almost tempting
[2:07:16] saga_no: @KingfisherGames Stephen Fry's own books are also really good, imo - he's lived an interesting life
[2:07:17] cashthb: can't really afford the brain damage in tech :(
[2:07:20] Blaizeria: There appears to be a mini yeti on screen
[2:07:28] witchhobbit: well here is my issue with parks and rec and community both great but have questionable people in it now lol
[2:07:41] daftect: what kind of transmog is that on your gnome?
[2:07:50] KingfisherGames: @saga_no you know what i need to get around to actually listening to? Brian Blessed did the audiobook for his autobiography
[2:07:51] Daemavand: and each martial art is different :D
[2:07:54] Daemavand: Oh definitely
[2:07:59] jeffdmk: if you learn a martial art please stream that
[2:08:09] KingfisherGames: and everything is made better with his booming voice
[2:08:10] Blaizeria: It's the yeti costume from Christmas a few years back
[2:08:20] saga_no: Martial arts is great for everything; exercise, mindfulness, general self-improvement
[2:08:36] KingfisherGames: Iskaaran
[2:08:42] 7thSaga: i wonder if someday that mog will be a Twitch drop lol
[2:08:46] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup, in my younger days I learned/helped teach Wado Ryu karate. Plenty of beginners, both children and adults.
[2:08:46] saga_no: @KingfisherGames Afaik, Stephen Fry reads his own books too; his autobiographies and his series on myths and gods and such
[2:08:49] witchhobbit: i love the silly costume mog, we need more, wow is silly
[2:09:01] Blaizeria: Slim to none
[2:09:01] saga_no: Hazel's GymTikTok era?
[2:09:02] cashthb: 0/10
[2:09:03] TotallyNotRaien: less than 2%
[2:09:03] edohran: BJJ best martial arts hands down
[2:09:10] anker_jym: A higher chance than the Love Rocket dropping for me today
[2:09:11] fallingupwards: I kinda cringe at the gym recording that goes on at gyms lol
[2:09:15] sence_00: I can tell you if you did that I would probably go to the gym more
[2:09:22] wolfcloudchaser80: But you're also an contrarian, so you'd do it just to show us up!
[2:09:24] jeffdmk: i am allowed to be an optimist some times
[2:09:25] Blaizeria: We sometimes get into the kitchen
[2:09:34] fallingupwards: People get so upset if you get in their camera pov and it's like ??? Public space
[2:09:40] KingfisherGames: @IndigoCat this is a new change btw, my understanding is it was only recently that one of the 3 got added, but the other 2 had been available for a while
[2:09:40] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I did Shotokan for a hot second in High School
[2:09:54] KingfisherGames: I read the first book for school over a decade ago, i need to give it another listen
[2:10:04] TotallyNotRaien: god recording in public is getting wild
[2:10:05] BoogiePonderosa: i recently noticed the item description on Tuskarr Jerky: "Is that...?" hazelYikes
[2:10:08] witchhobbit: yeah i have always been disgusted by that
[2:10:29] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Wado-ryu was derived from Shotokan! Blended with jiu-jitsu. I miss those days.
[2:10:36] itsparvati: i dont understand the trend to record yourself working out
[2:10:44] witchhobbit: i would never want anyone to come up to me in public with a mic lol
[2:10:44] cashthb: listen, if you get big enough getting doxxed will be free practice
[2:11:04] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 So Kata from Shotokan and more grappling stuff from Jiu-jitsu?
[2:11:07] Daemavand: Those people have SPACE for home gyms
[2:11:11] witchhobbit: "what are you listening to?" you don't need to know!!!
[2:11:24] jeffdmk: do you have rank 3 mining on all the legion ore types?
[2:11:25] Daemavand: and also a workout that lasts more than 1-1.5 hours is a really intense one, generally
[2:11:26] cashthb: also I think those people have a different audience than what you're aiming for
[2:11:30] Ryok: man two weeks of no flavor pocket D: with 14 alts each
[2:11:36] edohran: I just believe cameras do not belong in a public gym... Period.
[2:11:40] kynlaeh: yeah i recorded and worked with my trainer to help me correct form
[2:11:43] itsparvati: i was going to say, isnt that why the gym has mirrors
[2:11:44] kynlaeh: it was helpful
[2:11:48] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Yes, exactly. And it made the style "softer" than Shotokan, with less force used against force -- blending instead.
[2:11:50] saga_no: My pole studio would allocate like 10 minutes at the end of class for people to record their new tricks they'd just learned
[2:11:53] TotallyNotRaien: this week i got no flavor pocket too feels bad
[2:12:06] anker_jym: I was gonna say, imagine a streamer that works out AND plays WoW...then I remembered that Bajheera exists lol
[2:12:36] TotallyNotRaien: doesnt automaticjak work out too?
[2:12:38] morgothsheir: morgothsheir subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Meow!
[2:12:38] Streamlabs: morgothsheir just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:12:39] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Cool, cool - I only did Shotokan long enough to graduate to yellow stripe on my belt; but I really enjoyed it
[2:12:46] itsparvati: @TotallyNotRaien jak does too yes
[2:12:56] Blaizeria: Space? What's that?
[2:13:04] saga_no: Jak is ... jacked. (Badum-tss)
[2:13:15] sence_00: have you ever used one of those fur-scraper tools that looks like a mini coat hanger?
[2:13:25] sence_00: They're so satisfying
[2:13:25] itsparvati: i wouldnt call jak jacked
[2:13:34] elliongrey: So, my last horde character to level is a monk. I kind of want to panda, but I also want my race + armor to look cool. Not sure if I can make a panda look cool
[2:13:41] elliongrey: What do!?
[2:13:42] heldtheline: we're all feeling very punny today apparently hazelShiny
[2:13:43] sence_00: oh they are for getting fur off furniture
[2:13:45] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no This was in the early 2000's, but I was a 2nd degree black belt. Haven't practiced in nearly 20 years, though.
[2:13:56] witchhobbit: i have been looking for the past year, all 2 bedroom and even 1 bedroom places are all around 2k a month around here....its abysmal
[2:14:05] itsparvati: are hazel baking streams still a thing?
[2:14:12] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Yeah - I was training back in like 2002 or whatever in my hometown
[2:14:17] kynlaeh: oh i heard you saying you brush him whole peeing and i was like strange concept but could work
[2:14:24] sence_00: @itsparvati fit tho
[2:14:26] cashthb: i wouldn't mess with a dog while it's eating, I wouldn't like it either
[2:14:29] IndigoCat: I just bought an EquiGroomer brush for my cats and the amount of fur I hhave removed from them is disturbing
[2:14:58] BoogiePonderosa: "breaking?"
[2:15:04] itsparvati: @itsparvati for sure, i would call gingi jacked
[2:15:24] jeffdmk: It makes me so glad you have managed that
[2:15:27] wolfcloudchaser80: The Zoom Groom is a nice tool for toning down the fur flying, too.
[2:15:31] sence_00: honestly renting is cheaper in so many ways
[2:15:35] Daemavand: I've made my peace with it too. I'm content with having a smaller domicile to live in a neighborhood/city I cherish
[2:15:46] alex_klutch: And you check the prices, and bam 1.2 mil
[2:15:54] Zuldak: do you still document the local cat demographics?
[2:16:05] fallingupwards: I try not to look at real estate listings lol a single family home that's 1300sqft where I live start around 550k USD$
[2:16:15] sence_00: @alex_klutch where she is, more like 2.1
[2:16:16] anker_jym: That's a great mindset, good for you!
[2:16:17] Daemavand: Seriously, good for you
[2:16:19] heldtheline: self-care is important hazelFlex
[2:16:23] Daemavand: That sounds like massive personal progress <3
[2:16:29] witchhobbit: that's good
[2:16:33] Chronollo: Hi, your hair is rlly similar to an anime character in One Piece series, I forget her name though
[2:16:43] Chronollo: Do you watch the series any chance?
[2:16:44] itsparvati: up to 101 attempts for rocket so far this year
[2:16:53] cashthb: what if that will grow up to be Treebeard? I'd be so salty if I'd miss out on an ent friend
[2:16:54] itsparvati: got the dragon skin, no rocket
[2:17:08] saga_no: I'm just glad my Dad was able to sell the house he had and buy a new one, and not end up in the red
[2:17:38] itsparvati: so sad uninstalled made me lose my rarity counts
[2:18:01] saga_no: Yeah - he decided to move back to the area he's from after Mom died
[2:18:12] witchhobbit: i wish i could mentally handle living with a family member, it would totally help a lot with money
[2:18:15] Gih_87: hello hazel and squad hazelWave  what are we doing today, in the best zones of the game btw?
[2:18:15] saga_no: WHich is good - since he has all his siblings around him there
[2:18:39] Saheilah: Just jumped in, I didn't realize you were a fellow British Columbian! DinoDance
[2:18:41] heldtheline: there's something nice about renting: most everything is somebody else's responsibility
[2:18:42] TotallyNotRaien: learning lesson to always back up your wtf and addon folder if you wanna uninstall wow
[2:18:56] Gih_87: ohhh I gotta finish those too stergeLove
[2:19:34] saga_no: Yeh, my uncle lives like 10 minutes away from Dad now, and makes sure Dad isn't alone for the holidays and whatnot
[2:19:36] Daemavand: I think dreams are important for the long term
[2:19:43] wolfcloudchaser80: The Hazelnut Orchard Family Compound?
[2:19:48] witchhobbit: yeah that is the best situation, to have seperate houses or spaces like that. i wouldn't mind a finished basement with kitchen/bathroom situation with family
[2:19:55] Daemavand: and the value of family being so precious to you will ultimately guide y'all :D
[2:20:00] anker_jym: I played my Trading Post cards right. I had enough to buy a frozen mount, the discounted Rocket, and the Furendship Fox!
[2:20:00] itsparvati: i like the idea of buying land with another single friend and each building our own tiny homes on it
[2:20:20] elliongrey: So, I just learned about the "press and tap" setting for evokers "fire breathe"- --- game changer
[2:20:46] itsparvati: my mom has reached the age of scaling down her gardens
[2:21:00] itsparvati: its scale down or spend lots to hire someone for help
[2:21:05] saga_no: I'm hoping Hubby and I can visit Dad this summer ...even if that means Hubby will be "on show" for that whole side of my family LUL
[2:21:22] imKrox_: I wish I could get that mog
[2:21:30] witchhobbit: well it is an issue that people around our age are not owning houses and having kids etc like the older generations did. not a failing on our dreams or anything
[2:21:36] tehl00py: my momma is renovating her house all by herself. in her 50s!
[2:22:20] heldtheline: be realistic about your dreams
[2:22:29] Daemavand: I completely agree
[2:22:43] witchhobbit: i always enjoy the reminder that some artists didn't create their best work (or any work) until their 40s, 50s, 60s, etc
[2:23:11] GreenArrowed: they're dreams for a reason
[2:23:15] Daemavand: (and yes I agree with that too)
[2:23:19] heldtheline: fair enough hazelLove
[2:23:28] Daemavand: (I clearly am not grat for insightful thoughts today)
[2:23:47] itsparvati: KITTY!
[2:24:31] itsparvati: they are people too! with their own little minds
[2:24:36] heldtheline: how's the sourdough doing?
[2:24:36] Elrathir: wait... you have pets???
[2:24:37] forebringer: its always worth it
[2:24:40] witchhobbit: whenever i see kira, it makes me want to go see/pet my cat real quick lol
[2:25:03] Daemavand: and a caring family, a wonderful piece of the world to live in, a solid community that supports your professionally
[2:25:07] jeffdmk: wow your pvp is only 32% and you do a fair amount of it
[2:25:09] Daemavand: amongst other things :D
[2:25:11] Daemavand: and a bread maker!
[2:25:17] itsparvati: kira knows she is the star of this show
[2:25:21] itsparvati: look at her!
[2:25:37] random_redshirt: Kira is posing for her adoring fans
[2:25:47] saga_no: brb
[2:26:17] GreenArrowed: i'm v behind on leather pvp mog
[2:26:35] GreenArrowed: i guess i'm behind on leather mog in general
[2:26:49] itsparvati: im so behind on tmog farms, still hitting the mounts and pets hard
[2:27:01] heldtheline: I wish there were more transmog achievements
[2:27:16] Kurama__95: I bought the 2 mil Legion spider yesterday and I feel hurt savixDespair
[2:27:35] sence_00: are you buying those 375 conq boxes at all? I thought those would give mog but so far its all rings and such
[2:28:03] jeffdmk: oh i buy the arsenals first for the most part but I also farm 1k+ marks every comp stomp
[2:28:36] jeffdmk: My therapist earns his money that week
[2:28:47] Elrathir: @jeffdmk LUL
[2:29:43] Kurama__95: De Other Side LUL
[2:29:49] GreenArrowed: very DoS
[2:29:50] cashthb: da other site
[2:29:52] Zuldak: throne of tides and de other side must be your most hated
[2:30:07] jgbrit: That's why I hate running ICC
[2:30:12] Ryok: i don't like the 2nd and last boss in this place... because they keep going immune D:
[2:30:20] GreenArrowed: i felt that way about the other one too, in maldraxxus
[2:30:22] Kurama__95: That's why S3 of SL was so goated, the movespeed from Wo made it all so much better
[2:30:31] Zuldak: the opposite of no runnig but still terrible are the wave dungeons like violet hold and black morass
[2:30:35] GreenArrowed: yeaaa
[2:30:41] cashthb: the corridors on f1 are pretty short and the 2nd one has the eals, so it's not breainded
[2:30:43] GreenArrowed: that was my least favorite dungeon in SL
[2:30:52] Kurama__95: @Zuldak Worst dungeons in the game by FAR
[2:31:01] Ryok: i LOVED ToP i absolutely hated plaguefall and mists (at least on tyran weeks)
[2:31:10] GreenArrowed: i'd rather do the gauntlet in sanguine depths than do theater at all
[2:31:29] Zuldak: plaguefall and motherlode are my personal most hated. I really dislike tightly packed trash
[2:31:36] TotallyNotRaien: i liked siege
[2:31:40] itsparvati: NO
[2:31:43] itsparvati: GOD NO
[2:31:47] wolfcloudchaser80: Heading out -- happy Valentine's Day, everyone!
[2:31:48] GreenArrowed: lol tol dagor
[2:31:49] Zuldak: that was a trolling 'leak'
[2:31:53] sence_00: I would cry
[2:31:53] Ryok: plaguefall was my favorite dungeon at the start of SL.... and by the end of S1 i hated it because i had to run it like 70 times or so to get all the loot i needed... and then repeat in S2 and 3 merodySad
[2:31:57] Zuldak: along with seat of the triumverate
[2:32:01] itsparvati: i would do TD again
[2:32:11] itsparvati: i liked that place.... but they need to fix the floor bugs
[2:32:24] heldtheline: you could get Kira her own little desk, maybe she's trying to mirror you
[2:32:34] Kurama__95: @Ryok Farming Phial of Putrefaction for 3 seasons in a row was not fun LUL
[2:32:54] Hippwn: are her and moose getting closer to interacting
[2:33:01] heldtheline: I've been videos of people getting toy laptops for their cats and it's adorable
[2:33:06] GreenArrowed: @Ryok i have to farm my leggo in there, i didn't mind it afterwhile just bc it was the dungeon i knew the beszt
[2:33:11] Xerseiwow: what do u think is worse: shrine of the storm or siege of boralus? D:
[2:33:40] Ryok: @Kurama__95 phial... ooze... sword twice... cloak D: it was a pain
[2:33:47] sence_00: shrine is so bad levelling in lfg
[2:33:59] Ryok: @GreenArrowed oh i could do it blindfolded... the problem is i had to pug D:
[2:34:05] kynlaeh: we have the same thing, dog wants to play cats don’t so we actually regressed the other day back to having the gait up
[2:34:44] kynlaeh: it’s hard cuz i know she just wants to be buds
[2:34:45] Ryok: @GreenArrowed the healer i befriended eventually made a guild with a friend of his and me... he called it plaguefall raiders because of how often we had to run that crap D:
[2:34:48] kynlaeh: but she can’t do that
[2:35:19] Kurama__95: Shrine was long, but I really liked the dungeon
[2:35:28] Xerseiwow: another random question for hazel: who would win in a fight, jaina vs sylvanas?
[2:35:34] comemorning: awww
[2:36:01] cashthb: our current dog is a lazy fat nasty word that only wants belly rubs (and to murder the cat but that's a no go), I kinda miss my previous dogs trying to do mortal combat with me
[2:36:19] saga_no: ....aaand back
[2:36:34] Ryok: @Xerseiwow neither they both have too much plot armor and blizz will never kill either xD
[2:36:40] tehl00py: @cashthb kinda sounds like me
[2:36:56] saga_no: Pff.. I never bother with the who would win thing either
[2:37:04] Xerseiwow: @Ryok but when people duel they only go to 1 hp. so blizz would just let the loser g et to 1 hp
[2:37:05] itsparvati: iron man would kick batman's butt, prove me wrong
[2:37:10] saga_no: "Best I can do is stalemate." - that's it ;P
[2:37:23] cashthb: what if they are real? like the age old grizzly vs tiger conversation
[2:37:25] jeffdmk: The winner would be whoever the author wrote as the winner of the fight
[2:37:31] the_vegemike: use dalaran hearth ha
[2:37:48] heldtheline: I'm on tumblr; there's a significant number of people who want an enemies-to-lovers Sylv/Jaina arc
[2:37:51] Xerseiwow: i think jaina would win cus she would snipe sylvanas out of the air with massive iceberg spikes and send her all the way back to the maw
[2:37:52] anker_jym: Steve Danuser is gone now, so Jaina actually stands a chance lol
[2:37:58] Ryok: at least jaina and sylvanas are in the same universe... people who ask "who would win goku or superman?" are very stupid imo D: the answer is... exactly what jeffdmk said xD
[2:37:59] tehl00py: @itsparvati this is hard. both billionaires with endless arsenal of special gadgets..
[2:38:04] Xerseiwow: @anker_jym ROFL
[2:38:11] Numb2Every1: Happy Valentine's Day all! Enjoy the small things in life!
[2:38:17] itsparvati: @tehl00py batman won't kill, iron man will
[2:38:34] Ryok: @Xerseiwow well if you go by that logic... jaina went to lower hp than sylvanas when we fought both of them.... which is absolute BS imo
[2:38:43] tehl00py: @itsparvati ok tru
[2:39:05] SaraDivine: i never got the rank 3 mining drops in legion. drove me insane.
[2:39:23] Xerseiwow: @Ryok when *WE* fought them, not when they fought each other. jaina would turn into an iceberg the size of the one that sunk the titanic, and then heal to full hp
[2:40:03] Perkolate: tartare
[2:40:07] Ryok: @Xerseiwow and exactly this is why this is BS... the winner is the one the author of the fight wants to win
[2:40:10] cashthb: bear tartare
[2:40:11] icet0r: bear tartare, right?
[2:40:12] Zuldak: bear tartar
[2:40:16] GreenArrowed: hi kira
[2:40:20] sence_00: hi def kitty ears
[2:40:21] Sjoll77: the hazel bear tartare arc, i remember it well
[2:40:22] icet0r: the falcosaur omelet also did a similar thing
[2:40:27] icet0r: but only outside in broken isles
[2:40:28] anker_jym: I only got Rank 3 Foxflower last year, and I had been farming it since Legion. I got so tired of Highmountain
[2:40:31] Xerseiwow: @Ryok but sylvanas could snipe the iceberg with a massive shadow arrow that shatters it
[2:40:36] GreenArrowed: just being majestic
[2:40:42] random_redshirt: hazelLurk
[2:40:47] sence_00: the legion gathering achieves they added are maddening
[2:41:04] itsparvati: another alt half way done leveling with just pet battle WQ LOL
[2:41:32] Blaizeria: You still rocking the same keyboard and mouse combo?
[2:41:56] lilhunbun: hi hazel!
[2:42:11] Ryok: @Xerseiwow you're just proving my point
[2:42:12] itsparvati: how did you manage the convert back to keyboard after using orbweaver.. i just cant
[2:42:21] Blaizeria: Yep you still are I got the same mouse
[2:44:05] itsparvati: i have razer naga and orbweaver and its a forever thing now i think
[2:44:13] heldtheline: hacking muscle memory like that is rather brilliant
[2:44:16] saga_no: I don't think I could swap to keyboard at this point - but that is because I get hand-cramps when using a keyboard like that
[2:44:39] saga_no: I use a keyboard in BG3 - but it's far less key-pressing than it would be in WoW
[2:45:13] GreenArrowed: yes i think so
[2:45:18] itsparvati: i can only use keyboard for games with low amount of skills. wow has too many
[2:45:27] GreenArrowed: for me it's like switching between a keyboard and a controller
[2:45:38] 7thSaga: Pokemon?
[2:45:42] cashthb: oh yeah, @saga_no I'm kinda curious: you're rocking a razer blade right? if you're not connected to the internet you have no fan controll & such due to synapse not launching offline?
[2:46:12] Ryok: tbf all 3 consoles have X on a different position xD
[2:46:25] saga_no: @cashthb I have a Razer Blade yeah. Never had a problem with the fan not working, though - not sure what you're asking?
[2:47:12] jeffdmk: screw the law be nice to hazel thats a hot take
[2:48:49] GreenArrowed: oh nooo
[2:49:05] Catebot: once you unlock them, you will be inundated LUL
[2:50:01] sence_00: your mount is quite mad
[2:50:06] Catebot: I got myself a movie ticket weeks ago and now the day of, I dont feel like going, but I will force myself to go outside
[2:50:16] Hippwn: I recently unlocked world quests on all my class mains recently because it was confusing when some had them and some didn't
[2:50:20] sence_00: seems like they broke the dragonriding special actions or something
[2:50:24] 7thSaga: i just ate a DeliExpress Double Char-Broil and some Sun Chips Garden Salsa Kreygasm
[2:50:24] jeffdmk: world quest list is an amazing addon that might be useful here
[2:50:32] cashthb: @saga_no I assume you have to use synapse open to switch between like performance mode, or silent, or whatever else there is; synapse won't launch without internet - normally.
[2:50:35] Catebot: exactly, I hope so too
[2:50:48] saga_no: @cashthb ...no...?
[2:51:06] Daemavand: I've had a lot of days like that recently, I hope its energizing for you Catebot!
[2:51:16] alex_klutch: arcanocrystal
[2:51:19] Ryok: trinket with all secondary stats yeah
[2:51:45] Zuldak: i happened to have an arcano crystal on my warrior and used it in the mage tower. Put me over the top for arms challenge
[2:52:21] SaraDivine: i'm still very confused why the elite world quest in emerald dream gives 28 gold
[2:52:51] 7thSaga: x3 team of Ikky's PogChamp
[2:53:46] heldtheline: we needed the clarification :D
[2:53:54] Daemavand: I know I did!
[2:54:18] GreenArrowed: loool
[2:54:22] saga_no: Sounds like an Animal Crossing villager punchline ;P
[2:54:28] heldtheline: I mean, hen parties are a thing
[2:54:37] GreenArrowed: 100% a line from chicken police
[2:54:38] Daemavand: Oh i am so gonna start calling friends that
[2:54:40] Daemavand: Hey cool Hen
[2:54:45] Daemavand: just to see the look they give me
[2:55:18] saga_no: LUL
[2:55:20] Daemavand: No! I said Ben!
[2:55:37] anker_jym: That is a very close cat lol
[2:55:42] Daemavand: Henzel?
[2:55:45] heldtheline: Kira's listening to us
[2:55:45] GreenArrowed: kira what's back there
[2:55:56] GreenArrowed: she's investigating
[2:55:59] Daemavand: lol kira is great
[2:56:14] TotallyNotRaien: girlie doesnt know her angles
[2:56:15] cashthb: her cam now
[2:56:25] anker_jym: She's judging your rotation
[2:56:49] murloc_kingkiller: can you do a quick breakdown on your keybinds? trying to find an optimal set up currently :)
[2:57:47] jeffdmk: esdf is superior for movement because it is more centered
[2:57:49] itsparvati: z x and c feel weird to me
[2:57:52] sence_00: idk why but shift feels terrible to me
[2:57:52] anker_jym: I definitely don't still use A and D to keyboard turn after 16 years of playing WoW....nope, definitely not
[2:58:28] murloc_kingkiller: ah so an mmo mouse helps? can you hold down shift and modify mouse buttons too?
[2:58:54] saluda777: hello
[2:59:16] sence_00: *agrees
[2:59:34] Rigelhoof: Any luck on the holiday drake appearance?
[2:59:55] saga_no: My tiny hands struggles with reaching all the rotational buttons I'd need on the keyboard, lol - hence the Tartarus (which also lets me rest my palm on it more comfortably, so I don't cramp up as easily)
[3:00:49] sence_00: also JPC has some unhinged takes on keys
[3:00:52] TotallyNotRaien: i also have the logitechg600 but my tiny hands only let me use the bottom 2 rows of buttons sadness
[3:00:52] Ryok: the best keybinds is what works for you
[3:01:04] murloc_kingkiller: just recently found out about mouse-over healing. idk why that's not on by default
[3:01:05] cashthb: yeah, but the difference is that my key binds are correct and you are all wrong
[3:01:26] itsparvati: playing druid healer makes playing any other healer so hard, you mean my dps keys need to share space with healing keys!!! what is this madness
[3:01:27] chickgottrickss: Just got a 12 button mouse but it isn't assigned as seperate mouse buttons, its assigned as 1-9 keypad, but i'd like to use both keypad and mouse as seperate buttons entirely. I've checked everywhere but can't seem to figure it out. Have you ever had this problem?
[3:01:53] jgbrit: Somethings just occurred to me. With follower dungeons being insta queue, we essentially have 20 portals to all the dungeons because you can just run out after
[3:03:06] cashthb: or you can just do that 24h stream you're always promising
[3:03:28] murloc_kingkiller: @itsparvati no idea how druid healing works
[3:03:31] Ryok: @jgbrit oh that would be pretty nice
[3:03:35] cashthb: great idea
[3:03:52] cashthb: wait, 24h work out stream? that's metal af
[3:03:55] murloc_kingkiller: not a huge fan of ramping with healing, feels like im micro managing too many things
[3:04:14] itsparvati: @itsparvati druid form bars, they auto change when you shift, so i don't need to have a different key for rejuv and swipe, they are the same
[3:04:49] TotallyNotRaien: why have rejuv on your bars when you can install clique and having on button clicks
[3:05:13] Blaizeria: Personal preference
[3:05:15] itsparvati: @TotallyNotRaien that was example, i use vuhdo, rejuv is left click
[3:05:51] GreenArrowed: kira is ready to go
[3:06:00] Blaizeria: Kitty booty cam shot
[3:06:06] Daemavand: lol
[3:06:12] IndigoCat: hazelLove
[3:06:17] itsparvati: bye kira!
[3:06:24] Daemavand: Take care all!!
[3:06:26] random_redshirt: hazelLove hazelLove hazelLove
[3:06:26] heldtheline: bye! hazelVoid
[3:06:33] kiuayoukai: Bye Hazel! Bye Kira!
