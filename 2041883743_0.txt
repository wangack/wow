[0:18:03] anmusallam: can i see your talents sir

[0:18:22] anmusallam: thanks
[0:18:37] darrenchen2000: dk dmg feels kinda limp
[0:18:43] darrenchen2000: compared to yesterday
[0:19:01] anmusallam: my claw build feels horrible
[0:19:06] anmusallam: apoc and doomburst...
[0:19:18] anmusallam: i didnt use dot yet
[0:19:43] sacothedk: bursting sores kinda feels like a must for the burst no?
[0:19:43] darrenchen2000: both builds feel weaker
[0:19:55] darrenchen2000: doomburst doesn’t chunk like it used to
[0:20:14] anmusallam: blizz hates us
[0:20:17] anmusallam: lol
[0:20:39] MaybeRespect: Sadly, so far i feel alot worse into casters and melee.
[0:20:39] anmusallam: i got globalled by a hunter and he didnt even use cds.
[0:21:13] anmusallam: the death coil and wound nerf was so uncalled for

[0:23:50] logan9802: this song SMACKS
[0:23:58] petkicklol: haste/mast ring prob
[0:24:26] Diviniumz: ye the game feels completely different somehow with 34-35% vers
[0:24:27] petkicklol: game is slower anyways burst doesnt matter as much
[0:24:35] Diviniumz: vs 29-30
[0:26:02] rengokusan726: they are gonna get smoked here
[0:31:25] logan9802: you guys got out pve'ed
[0:31:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I figured Vanguards would be beast with the buff

[0:36:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think observer does damage based on health % yeah
[0:36:33] nerdyorc_: hey mes how is DK feeling
[0:37:20] xiliketurtlex: have you try using bargain instead of doomburst?
[0:40:53] erethrussa: Hello @notmes . Maybe 3 min darkness will perfectly fit against every call of the wild . Gl guys
[0:41:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: That was close, I think Vanguards was below 5% at one point
[0:41:39] c0jaK: gm
[0:42:07] sacothedk: could bargain be better than doomburst now?
[0:43:14] petkicklol: more vers gonna buff death strike even more
[0:43:15] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:43:46] sacothedk: so you think ds is the move now?
[0:44:16] Diviniumz: the haste that you have now is basically just being used to spam more death strikes
[0:44:21] Diviniumz: :D
[0:44:49] AxiomDK: Tough situation we are in right now
[0:45:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it takes some time to figure it all out
[0:46:40] Butthurtx: Hey Chat, does pandarens receive more versatility in pvp??
[0:47:09] Rustyz0r: My prediction is doom burst is still going to be the better option and it's just weaker now. Popping two wounds is surely better than not and fits the rotation better.
[0:47:29] Rustyz0r: I also don't know shit so take that with a grain of salt.
[0:47:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pandarens basically just get a 4 second CC to use on people
[0:48:44] Butthurtx: @wEiRdO_dUdE yeah but back to the SL they do have 1% more versa as a passive
[0:49:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kul Tirans and Highmountain Tauren have the versatility racials
[0:49:58] Rustyz0r: Yeah that's my concern. That the nerfed doom burst will still be Better than other options and it's just weaker now. Hopefully that's not the case... But devs thought dk too strong so if something else ends up being better it might get nerfed as well
[0:50:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Highmountain also gets a kind of knockdown ability racial, and Kul Tiran gets a fun haymaker knockback
[0:51:41] Butthurtx: @wEiRdO_dUdE thanks mate
[0:52:18] Pwnyo808: @notmes do you recommend getting 4 piece or the weapon first as ret?
[0:52:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: The racial stuff is a small difference, but for these high end matches it can help, depending on the situation. Always a lot of night elves and dwarves, and sometimes gnomes and vulpera
[0:54:44] aquamanwt: forgive me notmes
[0:54:50] aquamanwt: my brother
[0:54:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Often times class guides will include some suggested racial picks for each spec, and there are still limits on what races each class can use
[0:55:01] aquamanwt: whew had a doozie
[0:55:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard is working on opening up more choices in racials, but clasases like druid and demon hunter are still very limited
[0:58:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: 36% vers sounds beefy
[0:58:26] skidetko: !drops

[1:53:45] badpsy2: monk is god duo dps dk
[1:54:43] krome2dadome: @trollmasta66 both were kind of irrelevant. just counteracting the armor loss/increase for those classes

[2:13:09] ImHomegr0wn: it's sooooo much better for reviewing death logs but it has the random problem with freezing your game sometimes in the past

[3:37:45] AkioneDK: So you get instead 30% less dmg only 20% less physical dmg
[3:38:39] AkioneDK: But gues bigger Problem is the ret buff and dmg reduce from dk

[4:58:09] MedtnerFangirl: probably want to Blade first global because of tier?
[4:58:37] happyheals: you are doing the lawbringer judging
[4:58:49] ScumbagMusc: @saren8 truestatvalue i think
[4:59:07] MedtnerFangirl: need more PvE brain really
[5:00:07] officalsovereign: yo mes how do you have 1,2,3 above targets head?
[5:00:11] officalsovereign: is that an addon?
[5:01:36] Zerukx: its from Plater Profile

[5:02:21] stockbridge10: gl
[5:02:44] Rustyz0r: @notmes sorry man sure uve answered this 100 times. How did unboly feel today post needs?
[5:02:45] officalsovereign: !addon
[5:02:54] Rustyz0r: Nerfs
[5:02:57] stockbridge10: gg
[5:03:03] saren8: hunter just winning every round lol
[5:03:22] michaelss_: funny cause mm would normally hate this shuffle
[5:03:36] MedtnerFangirl: beef
[5:03:42] shugguls: war not playing disarm?
[5:03:54] Sokkee: is SP still Nr.1 target in SoloQ?
[5:03:59] spacemanwx: what comp did you play in Wrahful  season for r1 on pala, Mes?
[5:04:23] MedtnerFangirl: is there a world now for 4-holy-power spenders
[5:04:49] MedtnerFangirl: oh RIP
[5:05:01] saren8: I saw pikaboo struggling against rets in 3s earlier, something about perma wings
[5:06:03] MedtnerFangirl: you’re naturally building there anyway
[5:06:17] MedtnerFangirl: could be a duzh angle
[5:06:22] MedtnerFangirl: no
[5:06:25] avenueone: no
[5:06:26] mikepoggerz: is there an addon to decrease the size of the talent book? I feel like it’s HUGE. anyone know?
[5:06:36] Wogrim: I do /shrug
[5:06:57] MedtnerFangirl: it would interfere with prio because builder CDs are so short
[5:08:42] MedtnerFangirl: the inadvertent duzh
[5:08:42] CasualNicholas: so... wtf do DK even do now... reroll ret?
[5:08:57] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[5:09:03] saren8: almost nobody is running highlord's judgement rank 2 though
[5:09:13] nuggetzwarr123: so ret isn’t one shorting people? /sadge
[5:09:54] avenueone: needa make a 7 ret 3 heal rbg
[5:10:01] avenueone: just send wake and watch whole time die
[5:10:06] Drake377: @notmes after playing today, how do you feel about the armor changes? sorry i know this has been asked. just got here
[5:10:20] Pwnyo808: How much should i care about not having a "one set" transmog...i like one i ahve but shoulders, chest, legs are from the same set
[5:10:32] ionlyplaymetas: are you playing clawing or still plaguebringer/defile build?
[5:10:52] Drake377: really? im glad to hear its not a big deal
[5:11:44] WagwanBombaClatBomba: that mog is insane mes
[5:11:49] WagwanBombaClatBomba: LUL
[5:12:05] eMBeaR64oz: earthen has a cap tho and does a bunch of tiny DRs right? so big hits kinda bypass it a bit?
[5:12:48] Drake377: so the cloth classes dont feel like tanks then?
[5:13:32] MedtnerFangirl: WCL is tinkering with calculating mitigation as HPS in logs at least
[5:13:40] marcoolsw: ret good?
[5:14:14] Sokkee: same with lifeswap it shows up on damage done for the priest
[5:15:04] saren8: There's a whole seperate tab for DK for healing absorbed
[5:15:09] saren8: But you can't add it to damage done
[5:15:22] saren8: yet in the after-game damage done thing it shows your total of the two
[5:15:23] saren8: yeah
[5:15:49] dawsonator171: My brother got leggo tonight on hpal. They raining down.
[5:15:59] Drake377: thanks for the thoughts! appreciate it <3
[5:16:21] saren8: Yeah any melee cleave without a mortal strike is ROUGH
[5:16:25] michaelss_: the big problem is average playerbase looks at details and complains based off this
[5:16:30] michaelss_: so blizzard nerfs off this
[5:17:36] Wogrim: spirit link 4Head
[5:17:46] redlinerookie: It may sound dumb, but I enjoy games that apply nerfs buffs based on pro play stats, like dota 2, instead of the casual player
[5:17:57] saren8: I'd say purges are hard to model on details and they're effective damage depending on what they remove
[5:18:12] Called_a_Savage: How is the dk feeling?
[5:18:14] saren8: like purging a power word shield can be upwards of 100k damage on a global
[5:18:16] Called_a_Savage: after nerfs
[5:18:23] Sokkee: i remeber some nerfs because speccs where doing too much aoe damage on pets on details, getting nerfed and where unplayable (Feral)
[5:18:34] miraclethree: i think it reverses the amount of tick damage as you heal into it maybe
[5:18:51] miraclethree: seems wierd
[5:19:45] michaelss_: I had time dilate ticking for 190k on me yesterday and I died in .8 sec from 80% because TD was ticking whilst being burst haha
[5:19:46] saren8: Yeah but if they're stripping a druid's hots it has value that's not seen
[5:20:16] shugguls: i miss casters casting
[5:20:23] saren8: I think the hardest thing about shaman is everyone just stomps healing tides and healing streams
[5:20:30] saren8: so their cds can be killed too easily
[5:20:52] guitguit34: is dk unplayable ? I saw partywaffles lost 200points yersterday in 3s
[5:20:56] happyheals: early slands
[5:21:07] happyheals: their healing cds
[5:21:44] dawsonator171: 5% could be live or die though technically
[5:21:44] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:22:01] saren8: I think if they got more healing on their healing wave / chain heal it would be a good change
[5:22:09] happyheals: what makes sense is giving rogues a larger toolkit
[5:22:11] saren8: buffing their CDs too much leads to cd rotations and purge spamming gameplay
[5:22:36] dawsonator171: Because the 5% doesn't calculate into modifiers like mastery vers crit etc. It's just base kit.
[5:23:09] eMBeaR64oz: you shufflin on that pink?
[5:23:14] happyheals: just need to make the ability that affects the vanish and cloak cds longer
[5:23:32] shugguls: @happyheals foeberance on it
[5:25:11] happyheals: prob easier if it just makes the rogue die instantly if they vanish more than 2 times in 3 minutes
[5:25:24] DizziestShot: those bags fuck me
[5:26:11] Samurayny: is legendary good in pvp ?
[5:26:36] dawsonator171: Is this TR?
[5:26:46] DizziestShot: yea it's stats
[5:26:59] happyheals: yeah he is trying out the new legendary Dawson
[5:27:35] amnetv: this is TR ?
[5:27:48] MaybeRespect: Oh shit you got it?
[5:27:55] amnetv: I think the legendary is kinda trash
[5:27:59] MaybeRespect: Wait nvm
[5:28:06] happyheals: tournament realm
[5:28:34] DizziestShot: @amnetv probably still the best weapon but it's very toned down in PvP
[5:29:02] amnetv: IDK is max 2% diff between that and pvp wep
[5:29:05] dannosaurus: HOW MANY ATTEMPTS did it take tog et
[5:29:13] amnetv: taking into account pvp wep has vers/mast
[5:29:31] happyheals: the overall weapon damage alone makes it the strongest
[5:29:35] ionlyplaymetas: i got the drop on my dk today on our hero reclear before mythic raid, spending all tomorrow grinding the mats and events 😂
[5:29:59] gremell: ur him
[5:30:00] zachgamegodx: it’s insane for Ret I think bc of the auto attack talent but others it’s meh
[5:30:42] MaybeRespect: Crusading strikes @zachgamegodx ?
[5:30:55] zachgamegodx: ye
[5:31:01] happyheals: warrior weapon dmg scales the most so it is gigantic
[5:31:46] ionlyplaymetas: what was the question?
[5:32:01] zachgamegodx: do warriors autos hit in aoe ? @happyheals nooo
[5:32:06] saren8: h fyrakk lockout @ionlyplaymetas
[5:32:16] happyheals: he is looking for a heroic raid lockout for last boss
[5:33:14] saren8: Quick question Mes, why are Monks such great pub stompers but rarely seen in AWC?
[5:33:41] eMBeaR64oz: gonna be all rogues
[5:33:47] ogDoDy: u got r1 on pally first ?? or do
[5:33:49] ogDoDy: dk*
[5:33:51] eMBeaR64oz: meanwhile nahj was complaining about rogue today XD
[5:34:02] saren8: Does that change after the health buffs today?
[5:34:10] ogDoDy: no way lol
[5:34:10] ionlyplaymetas: damn i would have parked an alt on it had i known you would be looking. next week ill get a lockout saved with the guild and ill get you on it 👌
[5:34:11] eMBeaR64oz: he always does though i swear
[5:34:12] saren8: I saw other streams complaining about Sub not one shotting monks anymore
[5:34:15] ogDoDy: that is crazy bro
[5:34:23] amnetv: do we change anything in terms of stats on DK ? we go more vers now ?
[5:34:55] ogDoDy: is ret viable at very high rating ? or no
[5:35:22] Vaale17: IT depends on the meta i guess
[5:35:27] Pwnyo808: hunter feels stronger today too
[5:35:27] amnetv: also, do you ever thought of going stam gems on DK ? or I`m trolling with it?
[5:35:29] Pwnyo808: but idk if that's just me
[5:35:32] ogDoDy: what about dh, how do u think they are doing
[5:35:32] zachgamegodx: you should see from chucks pov, it doesn’t look healable on dragon either, he’s just using every ounce of energy he has to make it happen
[5:35:37] amnetv: I`m thinking this because we`re already on vers mast stat dr
[5:35:40] saren8: May I see your ret talents?
[5:35:41] Vaale17: If godcomb is Meta or Lock/SP ret will still be Not that good
[5:35:55] atoker: when are the rune weapon changes coming? next expac?
[5:36:07] zachgamegodx: even the demo splay was brutal
[5:36:27] dawsonator171: with spectrum you always have issues connecting. KEKW
[5:36:35] ogDoDy: is dh doing good in ur opinion ?
[5:36:56] saren8: Wouldn't bigger max health benefit the classes with % health healing more, like warrior, DK, frenzied regen
[5:37:10] zachgamegodx: yeah I just meant the cleave comps you guys play  seemed to be tough for Chuck to heal on  dragon and shaman
[5:37:17] itsChefOfficial: just made my weapon swap macro for shield of the righteous, will be super helpful now with the armor nerfs
[5:37:18] zachgamegodx: rough meta
[5:38:53] amnetv: at this point I`d like to have dots buffed even more
[5:38:57] itsChefOfficial: Will you use a weapon swap macro for shield of the righteous at all now you think?
[5:40:05] happyheals: dh boomy
[5:40:09] RealXrave: what do you think of dk dev
[5:40:52] Coppermedusa357: Prob gonna suck now with the hp changes
[5:41:00] Coppermedusa357: seems like were going back to bfa
[5:41:50] Cybernytez: but end of bfa s4 was faster than now sometimes when the stars aligned Keepo
[5:41:51] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:42:57] happyheals: I stacked haste on druid. Was at 93% unbuffed
[5:43:00] saren8: I mean people were stacking that corrupting blood x9 or whatever it was called on DHs and such
[5:43:00] eMBeaR64oz: the twilight dev one shots early corruption was so funny
[5:43:04] eMBeaR64oz: or the stars one
[5:43:25] Glowerss: The CDR corruption was pretty toxic too when mega stacked
[5:43:39] eMBeaR64oz: cdr on hpal was wild
[5:43:43] happyheals: also healing m+ for key sales or something. I would run 8 twilight devs
[5:44:02] Cybernytez: didnt someone got oneshotted in a tourney by corruptioN? like i remember a game where the gates opened and someone died
[5:44:02] saiyan333: ole haste Gpies
[5:44:22] Glowerss: There was a prot pally team that stacked a billion infinite stars yeah
[5:44:23] happyheals: yeah that was a last ditch effort game
[5:44:28] saren8: Oh Gushing Wound was what I was thinking, just run 9 gushing wound
[5:44:28] Glowerss: They just mega immuned and 1shot
[5:44:34] Glowerss: Or they died
[5:45:04] miraclethree: was bfa also the xpac with tank trinkets?
[5:45:13] Glowerss: Yeah no they did immune. It was a prot pally he had so much corruption he'd insta die if he got touched. So he'd bubble and then like queens or some shit and if he didn't win in 15s then theey instadied
[5:45:28] happyheals: I had an extremely fun time in bfa
[5:45:36] happyheals: using pve trinkets in pvp
[5:46:15] happyheals: Doing arena as bear or blood dk and one shotting people before they changed it
[5:46:33] Aakraa: How does ret feel after changes?
[5:46:38] Glowerss: I liked BFA a lot too but I'll be the first to admit iwas mega hit or miss. Like the BoD patch with all the absorb PVE items and double tank trinkets and shit
[5:46:44] Glowerss: barf
[5:46:51] happyheals: 10-28% better
[5:47:22] soley_96: reckon ret demo could return @notmes ?
[5:47:28] happyheals: it was a scuffed expac, but I had fun in m+ and pvp
[5:48:09] happyheals: resto druid dps was relevant
[5:48:10] Glowerss: It was fun once they fixed stuff. Like essences got great at the end
[5:48:26] saren8: DH just melted, what is that
[5:49:14] Cybernytez: i think they will never do something like s4 bfa again ^^ maybe they will but
[5:49:21] Cybernytez: i doubt it
[5:49:25] happyheals: I would play so hard
[5:49:34] avenueone: cirros online mes
[5:49:36] saren8: People hitting 91% haste is why they invented stat DRs now
[5:49:49] RealXrave: NODDERS bop karma
[5:49:54] Glowerss: Lowkey now that it's been awhile I kinda liked the horrific visions as well
[5:49:57] shugguls: just had a axe drop in LFR for some one, it dosnt show on loot drop
[5:50:03] happyheals: I had 93% haste and a mastery one too
[5:50:05] saren8: warrior also 3-0
[5:50:09] saren8: now we find out who the real carry is
[5:50:59] Omnixiaa: !wa
[5:50:59] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[5:51:56] happyheals: it was fun. I hit like 3.2k IO in m+ and actually got mythic raid mounts and stuff. Who knows, maybe BFA classic in like 10 years
[5:52:40] saren8: DHs in BFA were so broken, you could dodge for a second on a 4s CD, worked on M+ mechanics, and you didn't need a heal because you had perma 30% leech
[5:52:52] sunileif: ret/mm 2s?
[5:53:57] happyheals: yep, I would do that boss mechanic in the prison dungeon with the cannons
[5:54:11] happyheals: also fun originally but got nerfed
[5:54:26] RealXrave: What is that warriors name
[5:54:47] happyheals: I can't put a finger on the name
[5:55:44] happyheals: you can give the little frames at ther bottom right colors and stuff
[5:55:54] saren8: priest 5 wins
[5:56:01] saren8: Might not be a damage issue
[5:56:13] shugguls: had a axe drop in LFR mes
[5:56:33] happyheals: just look at purges after
[5:56:37] saren8: I don't know how its legal for DH to do as much damage as they do
[5:57:07] saren8: gg lol
[5:57:08] soley_96: Druid looks more rough
[5:57:32] Glowerss: That round the druid got ruined for sure
[5:57:41] happyheals: all it takes is a few last second purges
[5:57:42] Glowerss: He feels real bad about that one
[5:57:49] RealXrave: i had this convo with my ret friend where he wasnt convinced to bop karma, i said if it can win you the game it is worth
[5:57:50] happyheals: need heals?
[5:59:14] happyheals: deviled eggs
[5:59:16] avenueone: just cirro
[5:59:19] avenueone: i just reserved it

[6:04:40] sunileif: but i read of people with 12 and no leggo ;(
[6:05:03] Glowerss: I'm 488 equipped. That ilvl doesn't necessarily mean you've got leggo
[6:05:48] crusadein: @sunileif what macro?
[6:05:53] dawsonator171: I mean. my dk is 471 equipped and has one. So I get it.
[6:06:15] Bersolgens: i can also pump dps if u need me to flex
[6:06:25] DizziestShot: I can take a seed Mes -Ashkick
[6:07:23] dawsonator171: if only pally buffs still existed.

[6:26:12] Bersolgens: OMG
[6:26:15] Bersolgens: MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[6:26:22] dawsonator171: show who?
[6:26:25] the_audacity_x: hectic!
[6:26:41] SirChrisike: double wl lobby felt awful as dk. they are even harder to kill....
[6:26:48] the_audacity_x: hey Mes just curious how much the mats cost for the Lego quest?
[6:27:11] the_audacity_x: ok that’s a lot better than last time I checked
[6:27:14] dawsonator171: did ave get?
[6:27:40] middlebeach: Why you raiding?
[6:28:14] shugguls: why u not play war, there the best class
[6:28:21] Glowerss: That was the first time doing a pug fyrakk, the tank positions are super weird that was an experience
[6:29:11] avenueone: getting id 1 sec
[6:29:38] dawsonator171: @Bersolgens do the disenchant one first. it's got the most time consuming finish. even worse than superblooms. ANY EPIC will work for it.
[6:29:40] middlebeach: How does pally feel after Buffs
[6:29:44] RealXrave: this ret is insane?
[6:30:06] RealXrave: can u use the verdant mount on this one too I like the way it looks
[6:30:19] dawsonator171: plus you can literally do the disenchant stuff while doing superblooms.
[6:30:28] DizziestShot: 200 ping that was a little rough, what ping do you play on with TL
[6:30:31] Bersolgens: @dawsonator171 bet, ty for the advice, i have all the mats already too, ive been waiting haha
[6:30:44] atoker: people are asking for shaman now in lfg, has druid fallen out of favor?
[6:31:10] sunileif: it be chugging
[6:31:12] happyheals: that healing trinket ios nice
[6:31:23] dawsonator171: also. hopefully you have friends that will do superblooms, if you get an item called tattered dreamleaf do the quest yourself first then friends.
[6:31:45] dawsonator171: when you complete a full superbloom gives an item that you cast a buff with that lowers overall superblooms that need completed.
[6:32:26] happyheals: my hearth is still in the middle of no where druid leveling zone from faction change
[6:32:37] happyheals: only hearthed there like 6 times
[6:32:47] dawsonator171: took me 2 days to complete with full sleeps in.
[6:33:21] the_audacity_x: how do you guys feel about the quest to get it?
[6:33:54] dawsonator171: realistically not that bad, just a few spots where you're really lime locked based on CDs put in by blizz.
[6:34:22] dawsonator171: like the last bit of the enchanting stuff takes 100 minutes minimum.
[6:34:30] the_audacity_x: yea ok, when i read through it i was little like ugh about it but it is what it is
[6:34:47] the_audacity_x: yea ok that stuff bores the shit out of me haha
[6:35:28] dawsonator171: having something else you can do on the side while you use/use elemental stuff and wait for cd helps.

[9:10:59] oldmatevis: game feels like its more stable with the hp buffs
[9:11:00] waitimdesyncd: @honsou2  a overall 11 ilvl increase on all pieces is quite noticeable tho
[9:11:31] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd yeah but its nothing compared to how its usually been
[9:12:14] waitimdesyncd: @honsou2  true, but it should still be like 10-15% more dam going 11ilvls up. I dont remember what each overall Ilvl translates to for sure anymore, but it was usually around 1-2% per overall ilvl
[9:12:21] happyheals: of course that turned into a 22 everbloom
[9:13:14] Pwnyo808: i just need to cheese every cast at the start

[10:08:42] Solushun: oh thats epic shouldn't take that long at all @waitimdesyncd
[10:09:14] Solushun: time to make another druid for boomkin kek
[10:10:04] alltimer1986: you still taking necro wounds
[10:15:09] alltimer1986: no ebon fever ?
[10:15:11] Rustyz0r: So doom burst feeling too weak now?

[10:18:28] OjBarnes: What were you saying about when to go aggressive with a melee on you? I got an ad but it was super interesting to me
[10:18:47] zzxzzyx: How are the changes for dk
[10:19:36] MaybeRespect: You still rocking 36 vers?
[10:22:16] primejusticegaming: yoooo mes
[10:22:16] Szain3: DinoDance
[10:22:21] primejusticegaming: you planning on trying that pal world game?
[10:22:59] honsou2: anyone remember what the macro command to drop spells like DND on your feet rather than mouse?
[10:23:14] alltimer1986: @notmes do you feel like ret is just a better dk now ?
[10:23:49] honsou2: bm has ms tho
[10:24:02] OjBarnes: Could be that he's not playing 3x lifebloom or isn't utilising it properly
[10:24:09] meepoenjoyer: doesn't likebloom stack with pvp talent? not too familiar with rdruid
[10:24:12] OjBarnes: Would explain the smaller lifebloom tick
[10:24:16] honsou2: the heals will still show at more power in logs with dk absorb wont it?
[10:24:30] Rustyz0r: Might be letting bloom fall. If playing budding leaves and focused growth that's bad
[10:24:45] SebboTheFro: @honsou2 ye
[10:24:52] OjBarnes: 3x lifebloom is a pvp talent tbf
[10:24:58] Rustyz0r: Needs to maintain bloom on self too so all hots on both u and he tick faster
[10:26:47] Szain3: DinoDance
[10:28:05] honsou2: tried clawing against things like this yet? I was watching partywaffles and he was winning more with clawing in shuffle than with disease

[10:29:03] Rustyz0r: How many dispels did shammy use?
[10:30:36] Rustyz0r: Might be refreshing hots too much. My mate was doing thst for a while. Not waiting for that mechanic where refresh later and it extends duration.
[10:31:41] zzxzzyx: What about bargain
[10:32:10] MaybeRespect: Doomburst is nerfed but still best offensive option
[10:32:15] Rustyz0r: Pandemic effect is what I was thinking of.
[10:32:41] josephzein: hows the nerf?
[10:33:17] AndrewDrizzle: Guys and Mes, is it possible to make a WA that only shows the cast bar of an enemy mage poly?
[10:33:59] fatherdougz: Whats APM?
[10:34:17] fatherdougz: actions per minute?
[10:34:19] waitimdesyncd: @huvudkontorett  alchohol per month
[10:34:28] always_sad: can you show dmg recap please? @notmes
[10:34:38] MaybeRespect: In terms of kill pressure I feel like DK lacks. I enjoy DB for that if not claw build
[10:34:41] josephzein: do u feel like our damage took a hit?
[10:34:46] josephzein: is it noticeable
[10:34:56] fatherdougz: @waitimdesyncd Hmm LUL
[10:35:17] waitimdesyncd: @huvudkontorett  LUL
[10:35:18] josephzein: could frost be better now??
[10:35:43] honsou2: @josephzein why
[10:36:36] josephzein: @honsou2 if dks have low kill pressure now
[10:36:46] josephzein: frost have decent kill pressure
[10:37:34] honsou2: @josephzein theres probably no specs i want to play less in 2s than frost dk
[10:37:46] SebboTheFro: @josephzein Yeah but then you have to cut yourself in the wrists every second for having to play frost
[10:37:56] happyheals: I'm 8 days old on this druid in pvp
[10:38:03] happyheals: well this season
[10:38:11] happyheals: So Im doing a lot of bad
[10:38:59] plebcake_: chat i'm coming back to WoW since S1 dragonflight -- is precog now baseline for all casters?
[10:39:26] saiyan333: nope, have to get it on crafted piece
[10:39:28] SebboTheFro: @plebcake_ Pretty much, you put it on crafted gear
[10:39:28] happyheals: it is an embellishment for gear
[10:40:16] plebcake_: ahh i have a lot to catch up on then lol, wasn't aware of embellishments
[10:42:02] Sleezyfbaybee: i played a lil dk last night and it still seems god.
[10:42:03] Sleezyfbaybee: good
[10:42:14] Sleezyfbaybee: Also with the plate nerd, do we need more resil?
[10:42:18] Sleezyfbaybee: vers
[10:43:33] SebboTheFro: @Sleezyfbaybee Mes went 36% vers earlier today, not sure if he changed back
[10:44:42] Szain3: DinoDance
[10:44:47] happyheals: Sol you there?
[10:45:02] happyheals: wondering who runs germination for 2s on rdruid
[10:46:53] zzxzzyx: What about bargain
[10:47:08] Sleezyfbaybee: I was at 27% vers on dk, is that way to low lol?
[10:47:38] Sleezyfbaybee: Dk still pumps
[10:47:41] honsou2: is that 27% with pvp stats active
[10:48:04] Sleezyfbaybee: hes probably at 30% now right in pvp com,bat?
[10:48:24] Sleezyfbaybee: go war pop all cds on druid
[10:52:30] happyheals: My lifebloom went to self target again

[10:52:39] Blaze150000: Hey mes what u think of this specc? BwPA/gf1fDREKLfAcG9Z2HkF/BASSEiItIRikIRIikIJAAAAAAAAAgCJRSCJpBARSIlEJJJIA
[10:52:57] stockbridge10: gl
[10:54:20] Bersolgens: farming this lego is annoying
[10:54:27] Bersolgens: 50 rares? like give me a break
[10:54:30] SebboTheFro: @Blaze150000 I swear blood scent feels crazy low value
[10:54:43] Bersolgens: yea i got it in ur raid tanking <3
[10:55:08] Bersolgens: no defile?
[10:56:06] aant02: chat did mes get legendary today :O
[10:56:37] MaybeRespect: :O
[10:56:45] Bersolgens: so just fat 35% death coils?
[10:56:46] Blaze150000: its also rot and burst from doomburst
[10:57:58] happyheals: twice now I have had a ui error with Mes and when it reloaded it used a self target lifebloom from bfa
[10:58:18] happyheals: that I havent used since season 2 bfa
[10:58:36] thunderstud25: that sounds annoying, i keep being unable to bubble because of UI errors
[10:58:53] happyheals: I refresh lifeblooms and it just applies to myself
[10:59:00] happyheals: makes me look really bad
[10:59:34] thunderstud25: i actually think its something wrong with the key-bind and how it impacts the UI error, because when i move that spell to another bind the action works fine, even if i don't reset any addons
[11:01:12] waitimdesyncd: Individual buttons and sometimes whole bars break without other bars not beaking for me today.  Maybe I needa update addons
[11:01:48] JustTaki: hey buddy! How are you doing today?
[11:01:59] Szain3: DinoDance
[11:05:06] FaznikDKtnEU: Hi ppl!

[11:10:49] DvDavi: hey mes, how u doing today? man do u think its worth to back right now or just wait for the next expansion, i stopped  to play 1 year ago
[11:10:58] Blaze150000: try this with doomburst pvp talent
[11:11:06] Blaze150000: instead of bargain
[11:11:24] Blaze150000: just try 1
[11:11:32] Blaze150000: kk
[11:11:38] Blaze150000: but with ebon fever

[11:13:01] Blaze150000: i switch dk talents depending what im facing
[11:13:05] yourKnightmaare: pk doesn't play rotten. and plays defile
[11:13:38] Fugeki22: OH shit, I was the Devo just now..! what an honor to play you <3 love you! good luck in AWC
[11:14:04] Blaze150000: hmm then instead just play the standart clawing

[11:16:27] alltimer1986: time to bring out commander
[11:17:14] Aryawow: No armor dk sadge
[11:17:19] honsou2: @alltimer1986 no thx
[11:18:01] Blaze150000: but still cool that u even look it up man
[11:18:20] SebboTheFro: @happyheals if you figure it out let me know cause this is exactly what it looks like for me in my 2s when I queue my DK with my rdru friend
[11:18:28] alltimer1986: @notmes how about a commander build :) let those pets do the work they have more HP now and they shred through armor now
[11:18:34] SebboTheFro: into warriors etc
[11:19:29] Aryawow: @alltimer1986 Better to play frost/blood dk than that build
[11:19:30] Blaze150000: i tried a pet build... it wasnt even that bad i had a 5/1 lobby xD
[11:19:53] alltimer1986: pet build is good
[11:19:59] honsou2: playing around gargoyle is awful
[11:20:06] xiliketurtlex: @Blaze150000 what mmr?
[11:20:15] alltimer1986: garg is not the point
[11:20:38] Aryawow: @alltimer1986 Yes at 1400 it's pretty good
[11:20:40] Blaze150000: @xiliketurtlex 2k
[11:21:01] SebboTheFro: @Blaze150000 I mean 2k shuffle you can play anything
[11:21:08] alltimer1986: I play it at around 2.2 doing fine winning lobbies
[11:21:19] krome2dadome: u guys ever just?
[11:21:39] Blaze150000: @SebboTheFro it was when i got the for set wanna test a bit around with 20% pet aura and the maguses
[11:21:47] Blaze150000: four
[11:22:43] SebboTheFro: @Blaze150000 I get it, for me its more the satisfaction of how DK actually does not feel clunky right now, and going to a pet build destroys that entirely
[11:23:18] alltimer1986: I play zombies too LOL it’s hitting harder than coil now since the HP buffs
[11:23:29] Synpheous: no defile?
[11:23:35] krome2dadome: yo mes
[11:23:40] krome2dadome: u ever just?
[11:23:56] alltimer1986: zombies hitting for 120k
[11:24:46] josephzein: are u testing different builds?
[11:25:17] honsou2: zombies back?

[11:33:24] krome2dadome: oh also a really important thing for 2s is that you also want to keep bloom on yourself even if they aren’t going you
[11:33:27] krome2dadome: in 2s
[11:33:29] alltimer1986: 120k
[11:33:41] waitimdesyncd: double zombie into asphyx to lock down target and hitting woth apoc + doom burst as the zombies explode, is that what people are testing now
[11:33:43] garythos: how do you feel about uh after nerfs ?
[11:33:50] Synpheous: defile/grip of the dead not worth in 2s vs melee?
[11:33:57] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!

[11:34:45] alltimer1986: @notmes look at the one I linked
[11:34:45] waitimdesyncd: I love execute because im not awc player and I need to close games as soon as it is humanly possible to punish the enemies
[11:34:46] garythos: isnt better to have defile ?
[11:35:35] waitimdesyncd: U think the 20% more dam on sudden doom procs from the talent would be worth taking over 1 point in morb?
[11:36:06] SebboTheFro: @waitimdesyncd Lol, can relate
[11:36:38] nikthevoker: hopefully today doesnt suck as much as yesterday
[11:38:51] xiliketurtlex: is soul reaper still not worth using in arena??
[11:38:59] Blaze150000: Sometimes the dot build feel like its lacks finishing power
[11:39:51] NASAdesigner: this song is a banger

[11:56:21] Blaze150000: rotten touch instead of defile ?
[11:56:35] Synpheous: reason you aren't running defile is to test other stuff out?
[11:58:45] warwiz: Dk is in the bin
[12:03:29] Letudra: do you think claw build completely dead?
