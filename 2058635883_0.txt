[2:17:52] tvilk: why is it better for you to do orbs
[2:18:04] Ren26: i like to do orbs as healer so i can control when the damage happens
[2:18:04] tvilk: whats the benefit
[2:18:40] tvilk: yeah healer does orbs because healer knows about their own heal cds
[2:20:19] sulozor: so focused
[2:21:31] tvilk: maiden is 100% not prio
[2:21:32] IAmSolari: fire does mega prio
[2:22:20] mohaso21: You know what that means scripe

[2:23:01] mohaso21: iam 3.6
[2:23:30] mohaso21: iam 3601 you are still the same 3 points ahead of me
[2:24:04] IAmSolari: @Scripe have you thought of going back to playing in the RWF team? with the shortage of mages
[2:24:16] tvilk: scripe genuine question no troll why do you think its better for you to do orbs on deios rather than the healer?
[2:24:54] mohaso21: so healer can focus on healing everyone
[2:25:18] mohaso21: naah shut up now KEKW
[2:25:36] tvilk: wut
[2:26:06] tvilk: thats fair
[2:26:11] mohaso21: ye i agree
[2:26:20] tvilk: but i will say when healer does orbs he is so much more prepared for the dmg that comes out
[2:26:48] imwowplayerxd: resto druid has also a treant they can bait with i think
[2:27:37] azm07: sp

[2:29:49] tvilk: Lack of knowledge is definitely something we can blame on you
[2:30:06] tvilk: but then again, can we really blame you when you've been carried by mohaso for so long
[2:30:09] tvilk: Sure
[2:30:32] mohaso21: and then he says i can't see you up there when he is 3 points ahead of me

[2:52:53] zerossussy: no mage
[2:52:56] zerossussy: it was rly hard
[2:53:01] zerossussy: we had to all go pvp trinket
[2:53:15] zerossussy: yeah stun is overtuned on +30 and 31
[2:53:18] zerossussy: need a mage or 2
[2:53:18] tvilk: ohhh
[2:53:24] tvilk: omg you're going into WM i thought it was AD
[2:53:28] tvilk: i was so confused
[2:53:43] tvilk: yeah tree boss is a bitch
[2:54:04] zerossussy: dragonriding is the best thing that happened this expansion
[2:54:07] tvilk: I did a 26 where the lightning struck 3 times in a row right on top of boss and he just did infinite aoe dmg to the group

[2:55:11] KiwiGuy17: You need them 3.9k IO healers
[2:56:06] tvilk: !dw There's 9 total witches that can spawn. But they are RNG for each run you do and not decided on a weekly basis. There's 4 Witches that can spawn on your normal route, rest is upstairs and not impacting your % at all
[2:56:25] tvilk: https://imgur.com/a/cCh670d
[2:56:25] tvilk: Here
[2:56:39] manalul: Healer guild name KEKW
[2:56:56] tvilk: The ones you need to worry about is #1, #2 and #3
[2:57:02] tvilk: The rest don't matter for routing and %
[2:57:17] tvilk: 5 and 6 are always there
[2:57:26] tvilk: not all are
[2:57:54] tvilk: There's like a Seed that can spawn.. 1 2 and 3 have the RNG and 2 witches upstairs outside of your route
[2:58:01] tvilk: 4 5 and 6 will always be there
[2:58:30] tvilk: the reason the others don't matter is because you don't go upstairs in normal routing, but the other RNG ones are up there
