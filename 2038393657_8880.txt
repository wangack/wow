[7:19:00] Norn91: perhaps even 30
[7:19:17] emecci: galakronds cum
[7:19:22] ViviLouF: galakronds cum
[7:19:43] niko_is_bad: 28rise wasnt done for a long time
[7:19:51] niko_is_bad: and the first ones that were done were exploits effectively
[7:19:54] ciraxa: rise is just fucked in general, that timer is stupid

[7:20:32] Norn91: there is literallly on 1 +30 rise timed its andys group
[7:20:38] Norn91: if u ignore that highest rise is 29
[7:22:23] magisterofquelthalas: I was so confused, i followed u to ask werent a gw2 youtuber xd but then i remembered that u were and u ve simply ventured into wow to try it or maybe have been playing wow alongside gw2 for years now

[7:22:59] Norn91: nothing wrong with playing multiple mmos
[7:23:13] aFlyingGuru: firstGarf
[7:24:50] plebmeister99: does gw2 have anything comparable to a mythic 30+ key when it comes to difficulty?
[7:25:04] ciraxa: KEKW
[7:25:05] aFlyingGuru: @plebmeister99 nothing remotely close at all
[7:25:31] Triplespeak: lol, it'd be cool
[7:25:34] Norn91: would be cool if fractals were a bit more like mplus tbh
[7:25:55] magisterofquelthalas: Hmm interesting, it has such potential imo.

[7:26:42] plebmeister99: @aFlyingGuru what would you rank some of the gw2s CM content compared to mythic keys?
[7:26:47] ciraxa: Anet would get canceled by the community
[7:26:58] Angeels: not sure fractals even work well as m+ dungeons either
[7:27:14] magisterofquelthalas: I dunno, timing aspect of it causes too many issues in pugs
[7:27:27] Angeels: the original dungeons if reworked could
[7:28:13] ciraxa: think most fractals could work, potentially add a 2nd path or something to make em less linear. also trash needs to be reworked completelly
[7:28:19] plebmeister99: @Angeels why not? the hardcore ppl do speedruns of them anyway
[7:28:25] aFlyingGuru: @plebmeister99 compared to keys is a bit hard to say, but raid/strike CMs are... ROUGHLY equivalent to heroic raid in wow. it's not easy to compare directly because difficulty varies within the category (in both games) but as a general statement
[7:28:40] Eternal_s2: !gw2
[7:28:40] MightyTeaBot: Get Guild Wars 2 and all three expansions in one go here : bit.ly/TpotGW2 or try the game for free at bit.ly/TeapotGW2ForFree
[7:28:53] Angeels: @plebmeister99 m+ isnt necessasrily about speedrunning
[7:28:58] Norn91: fractals are just too slow and too rp heavy with few mobs, kinda not like how m+ works
[7:29:20] tomdotdll: @aFlyingGuru without exaggerating, low (0-11 level) m+ keys are genuinely more difficult than any gw2 fractal cm, it's hard to compare m+ to gw2 raid cm fights though
[7:29:22] Angeels: its about mitigating all teh damage and pulling as big as you can to complete the kill
[7:29:32] Angeels: and gw2 doesnt have real trash packs
[7:29:38] ciraxa: ngl even if Anet doesnt steal the full m+ system, adding a timer would go a long way
[7:29:40] Angeels: and the bosses dont work well for big hits
[7:29:45] bad_aarchitect: @aFlyingGuru  doggoArrive
[7:30:05] aFlyingGuru: @bad_aarchitect Binoculars
[7:30:08] Angeels: the original dungeons would work better for that purpose though
[7:30:19] Angeels: theres trash packs, theres stuff that you can skip which makes trash count relevant
[7:30:44] Angeels: and the bosses aren't like mini raid bosses
[7:30:58] Airu91: @ciraxa just infinite scaling would be better, might even prefer that over timer
[7:31:07] niko_is_bad: mood
[7:31:13] aFlyingGuru: @tomdotdll not sure i agree, 0-11s are like doing fractal 1
[7:31:14] Dandaros: the timer isnt really about being speedy, it should be treated as an enrage
[7:31:16] magisterofquelthalas: They dont have to turn it into a speedrunning challange, they can just make hard content however they see fit for the combat systems in GW2. Harder content is always appreciated.
[7:31:16] Airu91: fractal leaderboard coming soon Clueless
[7:31:34] tomdotdll: @aFlyingGuru for us, definitely, for the average peepo definitely not
[7:31:37] film11: vivi OMEGALUL
[7:31:48] Bovinity: Dunno why people get so fussed over timers, you can still do things even without meeting the timer anyway.
[7:31:52] Norn91: i understand that they might be worried that competitive stuff might bring toxicity but i hate it when games makes everything easy just to ignore that
[7:32:00] MightyTeaBot: doot doot
[7:32:07] Plenyx: doot doot
[7:32:07] MightyTeaBot: PLENYX IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
[7:32:22] niko_is_bad: If it isn't competitive there's no incentive either
[7:32:27] Bovinity: ^
[7:32:42] tomdotdll: @ciraxa disagree. having infinite scaling basically pushes every group into a god comp which could maintain all defensive boons as much as possible
[7:32:49] ciraxa: @ciraxa for sure, just thinking Anet probably wouldnt want to put resources into a fully scalable system but they seem to be willing to add timers like in convergences
[7:32:56] Airu91: saying 0-11 m+ being harder than fractal cms is kinda cope the other way around
[7:33:06] aFlyingGuru: holy obindo still alive GIGACHAD
[7:33:09] Norn91: cant u double jump over the ring without taking damage?
[7:33:48] tomdotdll: @Airu91 how is it cope? a bunch of m+ bosses are straight up harder than raid bosses on tyrannical
[7:34:00] eaSyRoca: i'd recommend trying it, i think i know what WA you are using and this one is way better imo
[7:34:05] niko_is_bad: ye but in a +11 you can solo the boss
[7:34:09] niko_is_bad: very easily
[7:34:42] tomdotdll: yeah but like im talking about players who are at around that level of knowledge and skill so not really
[7:34:43] Norn91: i vaguely remember doing it but not so sure either
[7:34:47] tomdotdll: though tanks are fucking busted so maybe
[7:34:50] Airu91: @Airu91 it's cope because they are 0-11, I did those after playing wow for like 4 days
[7:34:55] ciraxa: @ciraxa what is bad about a god comp for the highest difficulty content? there´s always a "best" solution
[7:34:59] heito: !gw2
[7:35:00] MightyTeaBot: Get Guild Wars 2 and all three expansions in one go here : bit.ly/TpotGW2 or try the game for free at bit.ly/TeapotGW2ForFree
[7:35:00] tomdotdll: thats kinda a balance issue side conversation
[7:35:00] aFlyingGuru: fractal cms are like a 16 maybe
[7:35:30] magisterofquelthalas: @bovinity if only, but it is tied to ur loot progression so u would get into situation where ppl would decline u with enough gear because they want to be carried :( it is not ss bad as it sounds it is still annoying. The trick is to have a guild/group of reliably ppl ofc as always
[7:35:31] Angeels: god comp sucks and it was pretty much a problem unique to last tier
[7:35:52] aFlyingGuru: aug GodEmperor
[7:36:09] plebmeister99: @ciraxa god comp is good
[7:36:21] tomdotdll: @ciraxa it's not inherently bad i suppose but it just straight up sucks in gw2 where classes and specs have so much variety and adaptability
[7:36:34] Norn91: @tomdotdll isnt that already the case in fractals? there is a reason discretize.eu exists
[7:36:41] Norn91: its just not as visible as m+ meta
[7:36:44] tomdotdll: don't you think it's very telling that the wow god comp occured after the gw2 class entered wow
[7:36:44] niko_is_bad: What is "so much variety"
[7:36:55] niko_is_bad: Almost every spec has done a +29
[7:36:57] aFlyingGuru: @tomdotdll gw2 only has class variety because the content is so easy, if the game had actually hard content people would godcomp there as well
[7:37:05] aFlyingGuru: ONLY qherald + hscg/druid
[7:37:09] tomdotdll: @niko_is_bad i'm talking about gw2 classes
[7:37:09] niko_is_bad: Most have done +30
[7:37:10] aFlyingGuru: like only virt dps
[7:37:21] niko_is_bad: in gw2 yeh but that game doesnt balance
[7:37:33] Angeels: in what reality is limiting the pool of classes that are considered viable (as people will see it as viability and for most people it is the case for high keys) a good thing
[7:37:44] tomdotdll: @aFlyingGuru yeah fair point
[7:37:56] niko_is_bad: If gw2 had hard content you would only play cvirt heralds druids and scourges
[7:38:00] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[7:38:13] Norn91: biggest problem in m+ meta is how it affects the queue, not really the key itself, every spec can do 29, gl getting invites as feral or affli tho
[7:38:23] Angeels: ye exactly
[7:38:56] Norn91: i really enjoy playing enhance, but pushing the 3.4k was one of the most boring experiences ive had in the game simply becuz its not a meta spec
[7:38:57] aFlyingGuru: well i mean people can choose who they play with
[7:39:00] Norn91: even tho its in a really good state
[7:39:09] ciraxa: @ciraxa would require balance taking utility/defensives into account if they want fractals+ to be a respectable game mode, the way specs and boons are set up now we´d see a similar situation to Dragonflight season 2 god comp
[7:39:13] tomdotdll: bottom line is all of this is a pointless cope conversation about things that will never happen Gladge
[7:39:31] magisterofquelthalas: That creates a toxic environment that ultimately tskes the fun out of gaming.
[7:39:55] magisterofquelthalas: There must be a meeting point between these extremes
[7:39:59] Norn91: necrofrost might be a problem with a single dps alive
[7:40:17] niko_is_bad: cant teapot fear or cc it everytime
[7:40:19] niko_is_bad: should be free
[7:40:19] tomdotdll: @Norn91 yeah im currently doing the same with windwalker. I reached 3,2k with like 80% pugging and it's draining waiting 1 hour in the lfg to get into a good group
[7:40:45] Bovinity: At some point if you're trying to do the top 1% of stuff you can't keep complaining about pugging it being weird. :D
[7:41:06] Norn91: im not doing the top 1% stuff just wanna play the game
[7:41:16] Norn91: im not really pushing for title either i just want invites thats it
[7:41:25] tomdotdll: point being that pugging with an off-meta spec, no matter the role, is so much worse
[7:41:39] aFlyingGuru: @Norn91 if you are 3.4k rating you are definitely 1% haha
[7:41:44] plebmeister99: gw2 is better anyway cuz u dont have to worry about FOTOM or stressing about every patch nerfing ur class
[7:41:56] tomdotdll: though playing an off-meta dps is far worse than tank or heal i guess
[7:42:40] Bovinity: @plebmeister99 Well sure, because there's nothing at all to do that you worry about. :D
[7:42:46] magisterofquelthalas: As long as they keep stay true to the soul of the game any improvement will only enhance ur gameplay. GW2 has been so much fun so far, i liked it. Only played the vanilla yet excited to try out the next expansion
[7:42:52] niko_is_bad: 3400 is very much top 1% gameplay tbf
[7:42:55] Norn91: @aFlyingGuru yeah i know its actually even higher than that but like i said, thats not why im playing
[7:43:03] plebmeister99: @Bovinity what
[7:43:20] Norn91: i just wanna see how high i can go IFFF i get invites
[7:44:00] MightyTeaBot: Subscribe to the stream to become an epic gamer! PogChamp bit.ly/tpotSub
[7:44:06] Bovinity: @Norn91 Well sure, but that was my point. You're trying to pug at that level, of course people are getting pickier and pickier as you go.
[7:44:28] Bovinity: Like if you told me, "I got kicked for not being meta in a +8" I'd be right there with you.
[7:44:59] cronic: doot doot
[7:45:55] Hundred123: noww
[7:46:22] Norn91: @Bovinity i dunno about 8s but it deffo happens in 18s which is vault level, people just copy whatever they see at top

[7:46:43] Bovinity: @Norn91 Oh yeah, people are dumb for sure.
[7:46:59] plebmeister99: @Norn91 lol 18!
[7:47:04] Markizah: watch out for knockback when ressing
[7:47:24] Norn91: you couldn't even do alt keys with an undergeared aug lol
[7:47:38] Norn91: without*
[7:48:16] plebmeister99: what key was this
[7:48:18] XarGM: hard boss for healer on tyra

[7:51:55] Norn91: if u ignore between 8.1 and 10.0
[7:51:59] Norn91: its actually somewhat decent
[7:54:03] niko_is_bad: my pug 25 today was 5mins almost exactly so yours should be around that or slightly slower

[8:13:17] Norn91: crazy utility, 24 cd rotation, pumping every pack
[8:13:35] Byrchi: There aren't really any bosses this tier where ret isn't viable ?

[8:14:28] eaSyRoca: just everybody play nightelf and ez fix
[8:14:30] Angeels: honestly fyrakk is kinda ideal for ret too since you dont have to do cleave damage when the bosses are there
[8:14:38] eaSyRoca: the solution to like 60% of mechanics
[8:16:04] niko_is_bad: Angeels you still wanna go for title this season
[8:16:11] Byrchi: Double freedom is great on tindral
[8:16:12] niko_is_bad: I need to swap to nelf for it
[8:16:19] Angeels: I do yeah niko
[8:16:26] Byrchi: 1min cds are great on smolderon damage amps
[8:16:32] niko_is_bad: youll always have double freedom cus you want both auras
[8:16:33] Norn91: incoming 27 rise
[8:16:59] Byrchi: @niko_is_bad Double freedom as in the talent that gives you freedom when you freedom someone
[8:17:06] niko_is_bad: ah
[8:17:18] niko_is_bad: idk do you want to do that though?
[8:17:32] Angeels: I just dont wanna be the one organising a group as im kinda maxed out with the guild and real life
