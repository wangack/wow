[3:46:09] Stabed: its whatever you can do to permanently maintain the lifestyle change
[3:46:11] moohuu: if you go "full on the protein" as an adult you have to mix in some fiber and lots of fresh fruit to help digest.

[3:46:15] xdslurpii: here for my daily pika spit in my mouth

[3:46:41] dogobreath: If you are under 200 lbs you are at victim weight for sure
[3:46:47] xdslurpii: have a protein shake can get 1000 calories and over 50gs protein if you’re bulking
[3:46:51] moistydank: what makes me feel better is I eat like a lot of smaller meals throughout the day so I don’t just inhale a bunch of food and feel horrible lol
[3:46:55] moistydank: I’ll munch all day
[3:46:55] moohuu: protein is slow to digest - that why you feel full. but you actually tend to lack calories that way

[3:47:28] oOThugnastyOo: Big protein shakes in the mornings help, add oats, peanut butter etc. can easily get 800+ calories
[3:47:28] cozyweeeb: increase your greeens intake
[3:47:31] babynatee: how much protein do u get in a day
