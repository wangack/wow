[0:50:02] ZackSmitty: Finally hit 99 parse on Mek for lock tank, but really gotta clean up the other boss fights.  Would love to full commit to DPS though, pumping is so much fun lmao
[0:50:56] ZackSmitty: Ye, we need the tank, so it's fine.
[0:55:00] Szain3: @Mendo Can you help me who can I contact about the Liquid spin wheel question?
[0:55:21] ZackSmitty: "we're gonna check logs" *mfw when they check logs*
[0:55:34] jmiles338: Mendo I am scared
[0:56:18] RangeRns: scared of what
[0:56:23] Szain3: i mean amongst your mods, Liquid staff needs a screenshot from my chat log that i redeemed spin wheel 2 times
[0:56:25] Thebatman305: ok capcom cup is over i am locked in

[1:12:59] StreamElements: DehBassman just subscribed for 50 months in a row PogChamp
[1:13:21] bgibson3393: I should be on later today but not sure exactly when
[1:13:33] Thebatman305: oof
[1:14:12] bgibson3393: What  did you ask
[1:14:28] bgibson3393: Mendos jamming right now
[1:14:36] JDXL: whats /playe
[1:15:22] kallysen: my bank has 12 days i think its time to uninstall
[1:15:39] JDXL: kalle has more time played on his bank than my 3 characters combined
[1:16:01] bgibson3393: What do you mean by /playe
[1:16:07] JDXL: what is your /played
[1:16:16] bgibson3393: Like hours
[1:16:18] JDXL: yes
[1:16:28] bgibson3393: No clue honestly
[1:16:37] JDXL: DO /played
[1:16:43] kallysen: bro JD instead of asking him the same thing 10 times tell him what to do LMAO
[1:16:44] RangeRns: mine is 6 days
[1:17:01] RangeRns: but im pretty sure thats inflated
[1:17:03] RangeRns: by my leaving the game open

[1:17:30] bgibson3393: I'm at work right now but I'll check when I get home
[1:18:09] JDXL: okay
[1:18:18] bgibson3393: I'm a little against GDKPs honestly
[1:18:37] bgibson3393: I think it promotes a pay to win mentality
[1:19:15] bgibson3393: Don't get me wrong, it's good gold making for groups that are good at the game
[1:19:56] bgibson3393: My /played is probably a little up there
[1:20:00] FatedBTW: Aloo
[1:20:53] bgibson3393: Yeah agreed on thatb
[1:21:03] bgibson3393: That but they can't fix it
[1:21:06] Ayjayyy: its unfixable, but banning gdkp isnt the way to bandaid it
[1:21:11] ZackSmitty: GDKP without gold buying are 100% a non-issue imo, but like you said, it's a very big bot farm/gold buying incentive in it's current form.
[1:22:11] bgibson3393: Yeah but they've ignored gp buying for so long its gotten out of control and will take them forever to fix it
[1:22:21] Dahun: just raid for the love of the game
[1:22:21] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:22:25] Dahun: whys it gotta be about loot
[1:22:37] Dahun: its fun :)
[1:22:51] Ayjayyy: eh sod was never meant to be a "main" game tho
[1:22:52] ZackSmitty: I do raid because I love to "do good" and get upgrades
[1:22:55] Ayjayyy: not as such
[1:22:58] ZackSmitty: But that lasts 3 weeks
[1:23:12] imvizoxin: im alr raidlogging 3 weeks into p2 nothing to do lol
[1:23:16] bgibson3393: And theirs so many accounts that get banned in the crossfire
[1:23:20] Ayjayyy: who said it was, at that point
[1:23:32] ZackSmitty: If they want people to get real addicted
[1:23:36] ZackSmitty: They give us arena
[1:23:43] imvizoxin: ^
[1:24:05] imvizoxin: stv event shoulda been way cooler people did it 3 times for bis epic wep
[1:24:28] bgibson3393: I just want a 20-30 man raid group
[1:24:59] simszszy: PogChamp
[1:25:09] Ayjayyy: the hard part is making enough content for a game as hyperoptimized as wow classic is
[1:25:22] Ayjayyy: without breaking everything
[1:25:33] bgibson3393: Yeah some classes get fucked
[1:25:37] madabber_: PREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:25:44] madabber_: ive been saying this
[1:25:50] Ayjayyy: i also think wow is testing out ability comibnations for future retail use with SOD

[1:27:29] bgibson3393: They need to do more than 1 raid per phase too
[1:27:54] Ayjayyy: oh yeah now I remember, they said at blizzcon that these characters might not even be permanent. they said that they might make a permanent server for these characters one day but thats about it
[1:28:01] Ayjayyy: thats why i said it wasnt meant to be a main game
[1:28:32] bgibson3393: I hope they migrate these servers and keep characters
[1:28:35] kcufthis: @bgibson3393 you’re smoking dick if you expect multiple new raids every few months
[1:28:49] Ayjayyy: me too, and i hope the end point servers allow extra broken stuff
[1:28:49] bgibson3393: Yeah I know it won't happen
[1:28:56] bgibson3393: But would be nice
[1:29:38] Ayjayyy: they can do both at once though, long term. they're testing what works now so that they can make something to exist alongside wow retail long term
[1:29:49] ZackSmitty: I thought Gnomer would be a 20 man
[1:29:54] ZackSmitty: Which would have been way better
[1:29:54] Ayjayyy: without putting ALL resources in one spot
[1:30:08] disquared: !gamble 444
[1:30:08] StreamElements: disquared lost 444 points in roulette and now has 123576 points! FeelsBadMan
[1:30:10] Ayjayyy: thats fine but thats twice as much work
[1:30:34] madabber_: so what
[1:31:01] kallysen: is it really that crazy when theyre already reusing old raids and bosses
[1:31:04] Ayjayyy: im 99% sure that this season isnt simply going to be played out and then thrown away. they're going to see what works and what the community was receptive to
[1:31:06] kallysen: only the mechanics are changed
[1:31:24] Ayjayyy: from their perspective, you have gnomeregan AND retail tho

[1:32:22] Ayjayyy: they are also attempting to work on 3 retail expansions at once, that might be overstating it cuz its like... one big expansion but still
[1:32:26] Fossabot: How do you earn points on Liquid+? Check here >> https://tl.gg/points
[1:32:45] bgibson3393: Retail is dying and the entry into the game is small and also gatekept
[1:32:45] Ayjayyy: if people love sod, which they do, they'll make more
[1:33:02] Ayjayyy: retail isnt dying as much as its story is
[1:33:07] Ayjayyy: the buttons are still fun to push
[1:33:11] bgibson3393: SOD has such an easy entry and learning curve
[1:33:19] boollsheet: W
[1:33:43] Ayjayyy: sod has an easier curve yeah
[1:33:50] bgibson3393: Yeah but for entry some of the mechanics are to much for people
[1:34:01] bgibson3393: For retaill
[1:34:03] Ayjayyy: theres more depth to retail in terms of second to second gameplay tho
[1:34:06] bgibson3393: Retail
[1:34:23] Ayjayyy: like, a lot more. but they're fixing that with runes quite a bit tbh
[1:34:54] Ayjayyy: well its not like EITHER version does a good job of explaining ur class to you
[1:35:08] Ayjayyy: thats the real problem. its just that like u said there is less to understand with classic
[1:35:18] bgibson3393: Yeah SOD is suppose to be the middle ground between classic and retail
[1:35:38] Ayjayyy: its like the last epoch of retail wow BatChest
[1:36:10] bgibson3393: I personally enjoy SOD way more than retail
[1:36:21] Ayjayyy: i love this song
[1:36:32] Ayjayyy: they're both reeeeeeallly fun to me for their own reasons
[1:36:55] Ayjayyy: the aoe in classic is just so satisfying and i cant exactly put my finger on why
[1:37:11] bgibson3393: I like the verity of classes from retail
[1:37:29] bgibson3393: But SOD has even kind of done that with the runes
[1:38:12] Ayjayyy: OH dude what do you think about this, what if they made all talent tree node requirements accessible if you had points in any of the trees
[1:38:19] bgibson3393: The story sucks major ass in retail as well
[1:38:27] Ayjayyy: like if u had 30 points in frost u could put ur last point in combust
[1:38:32] bgibson3393: The lore just got completely shit on
[1:39:16] Ayjayyy: ye the lore is a lot of peoples problems with retail these days
[1:39:21] Ayjayyy: its understandable
[1:39:46] bgibson3393: I think runes should just straight up change to abilities and the runes become enhancements to abilities
[1:40:12] bgibson3393: The amount of customization you'd be able to do with that would be insane
[1:40:13] Ayjayyy: wtf is this mix lol it sounds like a mix of two mixes ive heard before
[1:40:38] Ayjayyy: netsky is so good
[1:41:01] Thebatman305: lmao

[2:13:13] bgibson3393: Does that shield always drop from the first boss mendo in the raids you've done
[2:13:17] Venomous: @kallysen i have been practicing my rotations so i am no noob anymore for u guys
[2:13:27] PandaPew: You can cast regen/mass regen directly after an arcane blast and the dmg will count as if you already had the budf up due to spellbatching btw
[2:13:54] Ayjayyy: ehh?
[2:14:08] Ayjayyy: how strange
[2:14:14] bgibson3393: I want that shield
