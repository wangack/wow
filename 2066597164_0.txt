[0:01:49] StreamElements: Once again, STAAHLE_ZGZ WAS FIRST
[0:02:37] Spyke_ZGZ: So, there's a League streamer that tried casting last year and he was REALLY GOOD. BUT, it was too stressful to juggle and streaming makes way more money.
[0:02:50] Spyke_ZGZ: So Riot gave him a fucking set up IN THEIR STUDIO for him to streamcast the playoffs KEKW
[0:03:06] Zeegers: lmao damn
[0:03:19] Spyke_ZGZ: Best of both worlds
[0:03:21] Zeegers: professional play / casting is definitely more stress / travel than streaming i'd imagine
[0:03:22] Spyke_ZGZ: Gotta hand it to them tbh
[0:03:54] Spyke_ZGZ: Yup. He's only doing it for playoffs. He said he had to quit because last year there were like WEEKS of zero free time. Like a constant Subathon.
[0:04:46] Spyke_ZGZ: Plus it's still his stream so he can say grown up words. :^)

[3:23:19] yoplayyoggie: See, I watched your VODs. lets not get into this
[3:23:24] Broseph33: stocks pull is hard man, not anyone can strafe left and right
[3:24:46] Topher_IRL: Fuck that IMO I'd have died of boredom tapping A and D for 8 levels

[4:33:14] DrunkenHorror: all the classes and a trading/SSF "guild"
[4:33:44] DrunkenHorror: its ssf ish
[4:33:51] DrunkenHorror: you can still trade with friends u play with alot
[4:33:54] aginsb: so you dont even pick the guild until chapter 9
[4:33:55] aginsb: and yes
[4:33:58] aginsb: you still play together
[4:34:00] Rmont: no, solo
[4:34:24] Rmont: no trade, ah, mailbox, etc.
[4:34:28] DrunkenHorror: kinda if u play with them
[4:34:32] aginsb: in fact, if you're in the non-trade guild and you play a lot with someone you can drop items that will let you trade with them

[4:35:12] StreamElements: Have some constructive ideas for my stream? Send me a message, or checkout https://discord.gg/Zeegers - I'd love to hear it!
[4:35:18] Rmont: you're talking WoW SSF?
[4:35:20] aginsb: theres 2 different things
[4:35:25] DrunkenHorror: but theres also resonance.  if we play togeather alot we can drop mega rare items that allow you to trade an item with THAT player reguardless of  if u were playing with them when it droped
[4:35:40] aginsb: 1) if an item drops while you are in a party with someone you can gift it to them no matter what
[4:35:59] DrunkenHorror: you can also play the trading guild which lets you use an aucton house type thing (think traderiery)
[4:36:03] aginsb: 2) there is a rare drop that will drop more often as you play with someone specifically that will drop and let you gift items that drop when you weren;t in party
[4:36:10] aginsb: the self found thing is separate
[4:36:18] aginsb: instead of trading, it lets you target farm better
[4:36:41] DrunkenHorror: you can still full SSF or you can do the "solo but i like playing with friends"  or the full trade empire  type play styles
[4:36:59] aginsb: Do you want to see the blog post?
[4:37:09] DrunkenHorror: zizaran had a good video explaining it
[4:37:52] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers 10 ish?
[4:37:55] DrunkenHorror: or less

[4:55:09] xecksi: you need gear though and runes
[4:55:35] robbytears: Geared war and druid will hard out scale
[4:55:49] xecksi: heh
[4:56:11] LumberChopMan: I went back and watched the old ZG 1pull guide, its really good, excellent delivery the way you broke it down and had your reference "variable" sections to save depth for the end and get straight through the core guide then fill in details at the end.
[4:56:48] xecksi: warrior outscale them with gear true but a warrior will almost never out threat a shaman
[4:57:11] LumberChopMan: like following you through giving notes as to what you were doing then give all the info they MAY need depending on what they ran into. Solid
[4:59:23] Topher_IRL: I heard a USB disconnect from the kitchen, was that me
[4:59:50] LumberChopMan: Exactly, it was quality for sure. Delivering a comprehensive explanation like that is not easy and a lot of people do it very poorly lol

[6:46:27] perezito910: “Pop” is used predominantly in the Northwest, the Great Plains and the Midwest. The word was originated by a British poet in 1812, who wrote, “A new manufacture of a nectar, between soda water and ginger beer, and called 'pop,' because 'pop goes the cork' when it is drawn.”

[10:07:47] DJPernicus: scorch spam is the play?
[10:09:47] DJPernicus: Nice, haven't played my mage much this phase. Still AOE leveling.
[10:09:53] DJPernicus: The horde spots in arathi are amazing
[10:11:00] FaeyeLinn: Even a moonfire from a healer kills them after one tick.
[10:14:58] lordalleman: are level 40 toons no longer able to get bfd boon?
[10:15:32] Spyke_ZGZ: @lordalleman nope
[10:15:57] Spyke_ZGZ: You get Gnomer and you like it
[10:15:58] lordalleman: @Spyke_ZGZ whats the reasoning on that?
[10:16:06] lordalleman: oof
[10:16:22] DrunkenHorror: @lordalleman immagine phase 4 with 3 new raid buffs +old buffs
[10:16:27] Spyke_ZGZ: ^^^

[10:17:07] DrunkenHorror: @lordalleman its to avoid power creep,  if the buffs are impactfull they would either have to make them required  or not usable in raid,  this way only current buff has a place in raid
[10:19:07] lordalleman: i guess

[10:19:43] lordalleman: i'm gonna try it though. i have bfd, gnomer, and dark faire boon protected on
[10:19:46] lordalleman: displacer
[10:19:57] Rmont: got therma down... that fights a cluster
[10:20:11] FaeyeLinn: @lordalleman I think gnomer strips you of your BFD buff.
[10:20:25] lordalleman: @FaeyeLinn ahhh...interesting
[10:20:39] kidscientis: gonna close tab good night brotha
[10:21:10] Convoak: @kidscientis I'll be thinking of you
[10:22:35] Topher_IRL: Night dood!
[10:23:07] Altariaz: Hey, sup? Not raided gnomes yet, what is it like
[10:23:52] shlappyz: ya gnomer very mechanic oriented, definitely doable tho
[10:24:13] Rmont: went in blind tonight, was a doozy
[10:24:57] DrunkenHorror: @Altariaz fun,  bit too long for a 3 day reset IMO but im enjoying it
[10:24:59] Topher_IRL: topher20Gogogo topher20Gogogo topher20Gogogo topher20Gogogo
[10:28:41] FaeyeLinn: Not rank 1. Rank 7.
[10:28:42] FaeyeLinn: LUL
[10:29:51] Rmont: I ran with my buddies guild in his place cause hes banned for gold buying, and they were in all comms but me haha
[10:29:54] Rmont: was a cluster for me
[10:32:12] Rmont: yeah 6/6, was fun for sure
[10:32:28] Rmont: you def want some mages for trash in here damn
[10:32:30] Rmont: trash city...
[10:33:38] DrunkenHorror: nah warlock tank
[10:33:52] DrunkenHorror: just hellfire spam and make it the healers problem
[10:34:35] lordalleman: 3 mages...i bet getting through the mobs was a breeze

[10:37:37] FaeyeLinn: Who are the healers?
[10:37:43] StreamElements: Zeegers Stream !wishlist found @ https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/1DQO27SB3Y8OP?ref_=wl_share
[10:38:20] graphix10: would you like a suggestion ?
[10:38:29] graphix10: alternating button pushes is ok between 2 players mages with blink is best option max bombs is 2 if you sit in the middle of the room thats how we did this boss.
[10:38:43] graphix10: that seems to be your big issue
[10:38:59] graphix10: yeh the p1 death was rough
[10:39:37] graphix10: also hunters are very good at killing bombs over any other class i noticed to stop them spreading out all over the place xD
[10:39:44] FaeyeLinn: It seems like the healers should be doing a lot more clicking. There are pauses between spikes, and getting 15% of your mana bar back as a healer is a HUGE deal.
[10:40:11] graphix10: healers have it rough if they click though
[10:40:15] graphix10: i mean if they run low on amna they should
[10:40:37] Rmont: mana is a bitch on this fight
[10:40:47] graphix10: are you guys using faps as nobody is calling faps either i notice
[10:41:06] graphix10: you should wait 5 seconds
[10:41:18] graphix10: 3 cant remember what we did if it was 3 /5
[10:41:19] graphix10: then fap
[10:41:20] DrunkenHorror: im back,  how did the last attempt go
[10:41:32] graphix10: take control my man show them who da don is :D
[10:41:37] Rmont: dont even know if we fapped tbh, I didnt
[10:42:29] graphix10: another thing i noticed as well is nobody is communicating button pushes
[10:42:38] graphix10: which allows more bombs to come out and disrupt positioning
[10:43:01] Rmont: would probably help to mark the button pushers too, helps with spacing
[10:44:19] graphix10: button pushers should be centre room / with 3 mages this shouldnt be and issue with blink
[10:44:30] graphix10: but look at that 3 bombs on the floor
[10:44:34] graphix10: costing healing from healers
[10:44:46] Rmont: how come when I hit the button it knocked me down, but not your gnome ass
[10:44:58] graphix10: you might have got hit with bomb ?
[10:45:17] Rmont: eh maybe idk

[10:46:48] graphix10: someone was frozen
[10:46:52] DrunkenHorror: total # of stacks = raid dmg amount
[10:47:55] FaeyeLinn: I'm fapping the whole time. KappaHD
[10:48:09] DrunkenHorror: @graphix10 does someone being frozen affect it?
[10:48:36] FaeyeLinn: @DrunkenHorror Well, if they're frozen then they have a bunch of stacks.
[10:48:55] graphix10: yes
[10:48:59] graphix10: if you get frozen its raid wipe
[10:49:06] graphix10: you need to dispell it
[10:50:08] graphix10: its ok im here all week :D
