[1:31:45] MuttonChopins: he is literally saying he doesnt have many cases in his town @h03m03
[1:32:02] Cadstars: I think also in BC a lot of the mobs in those areas have much more hard hitting attacks and dots than classic

[1:34:20] kargdahm: A quiver gives you increased attackspeed thoug
[1:34:23] Slumbering_Bear: Yeah Hunter's always seemed like too much work to play in classic, with having to actually buy arrows too... XD
[1:34:49] hutzika: It is 200 per slot

[2:15:38] Layercake: gsxrKEKW free 58? cmon ..uncle Bobby needs another yacht
[2:15:45] Xockel: @Thunderbrew If you start from lvl 1, no

[2:16:24] crrdsh: blah blah blah then a choice your mom joke at the end
[2:16:30] VBTIGER89: Morer like 80 in aus\
[2:16:42] Thunderbrew: When BC originally came out could you make a new 58?
[2:16:42] TweakT: Bobby could play a gnome in wow
[2:16:45] NovaSun84: he wanted to TL:DR the book for you
[2:16:47] TweakT: or a goblin
[2:16:51] Xockel: @Thunderbrew No
[2:17:28] Thunderbrew: Ok. I ddn't play back then. I do have a 52 Classic Shaman.

[2:18:48] Veegore: Have people started with the whole "i can't wait to level my dh in tbc classic" yet?
[2:18:55] JakobEll: Leveling a new character at a launch expansion is ridiculous with classic exp. They'll be halfway into second raid tier before you're 80
[2:18:56] Thunderbrew: Thanks for all the answers. Appreciate it.

[2:20:53] Artivicii: rough times KEKW
[2:20:54] TheMounTing: just the sheer time you need to put in classic can put people off, so its nothing but positives to allow for a boost
[2:21:04] Thunderbrew: @Artivicii Had to cut back on some expenses.
[2:21:09] TweakT: If Blizzard weren't greedy, they'd just offer Recruit a friend, but instead they milk money
[2:21:09] MuttonChopins: classic leveling can be rough for some people
[2:21:15] Grizzly_Knight: is the one time boost free
[2:21:16] TheMounTing: true that man
[2:21:17] Artivicii: @Thunderbrew happens to me too
[2:21:22] Thunderbrew: I'm 52 in Classic. Is questing best way to get to 58?
[2:21:39] JakobEll: They know the pandemic is about to be over, so they have to get people hooked asap
[2:21:53] Artivicii: @Thunderbrew at those levels, yes waaaay faster
[2:22:03] Thunderbrew: If that was how BC was back then, I'm good with it.
[2:22:05] TweakT: they should sell TCG shit for money, that'd be better than this 58 boost
[2:22:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just want dual spec
[2:22:09] indiana__cones: It's no secret vanilla and classic and complete different experiences, so what makes people think TBC will be any different? I'll pass on the recycled content again
[2:22:10] MrGattz: this pandemic isnt over for another year+. just btw lol
[2:22:18] Herzenliegen: @jakobell the pademic is going to over?
[2:22:34] Bombayshow: Cant wait for covid 2
[2:22:36] Bombayshow: LUL
[2:22:41] Herzenliegen: @mrgattz thank you
[2:22:49] JakobEll: Arent vaccines coming out this summer?
[2:22:52] Broomba: @jakobell knows something we don‚Äôt
[2:22:54] MrGattz: people are to stupid for it to be almost over unfortunately
[2:22:58] Lockrocker: I dont get why people are against it... like a level 58 boost is going to affect their gameplay
[2:23:20] MuttonChopins: it will take awhile to go back to normal
[2:23:21] Ghoost172: How does the 58 boost work? every1 just get one or?
[2:23:23] Artivicii: id rather do a 15 sanguine than this WutFace
[2:23:27] TheItalianStallion321: vaccines are out of already
[2:23:29] johnsmith_cb: Lockrocker it makes your own leveling feel worthless
[2:23:43] LordKain73: with the new variants being discovered, yea, good luck this being over soon.
[2:23:54] MrGattz: @whiteblondeboi why? whats more fun in retail atm?
[2:24:03] MuttonChopins: yeah but from I read last time less than 1% of people have taken the vaccine @TheItalianStallion321
[2:24:15] Lockrocker: isnt that up to the player on the end of the boost. to deal with their own feeling? @johnsmith_cb  not yours?
[2:24:36] TheItalianStallion321: b/c not a lot of people want to take it. but the vaccines are out. plus its mostly healthcare people 1st, i believe @TacoVendor93
[2:24:37] I_DoctorSatan_I: Imagine knowing there's a WoW channel that has "other" streamers playing retail LUL LUL
[2:24:37] Thunderbrew: They aren't doing any thing, or are unable to, fix the botting in Retail.
[2:24:44] JakobEll: TacoVendor93 oh 1/3rd of the elderly and vulnerable population in my country is already vaccinated
[2:24:46] althoris: Im worried there will be a ton of 58s at the beginning flooding the quest zones and 1 month later noone to be seen as people losing interest in a boosted char
[2:24:52] Broomba: @whiteblondeboi since we did this channel become Asmongolds stream?
[2:25:07] MrGattz: retail is dying in general. blizzard decided to wait 2 months to fix issues that we know wont fix issues.
[2:25:08] johnsmith_cb: Lockrocker if someone paid to boost their gear its the same shit. they didnt put in the work
[2:25:25] TheItalianStallion321: @MrGattz agreed man...agreed.....and still havent fixed everything
[2:25:31] TweakT: I've never actually played any of my boosted characters, lost interest immediately cause of 0 time investment
[2:25:33] Lockrocker: they arent seeling a gear boost @johnsmith_cb ... thats a mute point
[2:25:39] rollypolly89: TBC was amazing. loved getting my Suneater sword from heroic Mech
[2:25:42] Thunderbrew: Will you be able to Queue for dungeons in BC Classic?
[2:25:46] johnsmith_cb: Lockrocker its an analogy, are you dense?
[2:25:46] Layercake: The world has changed, games/expasions and patches and getting delayed left and right. Companies already adjusted to that and we need to do the same. Still its going to take awhile things normalize
[2:25:47] rollypolly89: with mongoose enghant
[2:25:53] Cadstars: The thing is most people will be boosting into a class they have NO idea about and get overwhelmed fast.
[2:25:57] Xockel: zones will be layered, lets see how good it works out this time.
[2:26:04] Lockrocker: its a mute analogy @johnsmith_cb
[2:26:14] sphynx_rayne: just getting lucky and low servers
[2:26:18] Lockrocker: its a level boost.. not a gear boost
[2:26:36] big_giganti: Preach!
[2:26:37] Bombayshow: yeah let activison make money !
[2:26:38] TweakT: when other people affect what I can do it bothers me
[2:26:38] DrNikoss: facts
[2:26:39] Herzenliegen: exactly
[2:26:40] Lockrocker: the boost still means you have to grind low level professions
[2:26:43] johnsmith_cb: its a character progression, same thing Lockrocker
[2:26:45] I_DoctorSatan_I: And Blizzard is adding 40 more renown ranks. Gee...another gate for another 4 weeks to unlock flying since there's going to be 4 more campaign quests which is locked behind renown
[2:26:46] petroglyphs: LUL
[2:26:46] Xockel: ye who cares, i agree
[2:26:47] oTOKEo: FACTS

[2:35:54] TheItalianStallion321: talent trees were the same from classic to TBC, werent they?
[2:35:59] kargdahm: Some classes, like Druid tank becomes much harder to play in the Prepatch though, since Maul doesn't get a threat modifier, and we still have the Classic gear
