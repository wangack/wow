[3:02:24] koheed13: tires are wear and tear
[3:02:26] cpots: i'd charge you more if I saw your face
[3:02:28] koheed13: not covered
[3:02:33] Meeloh: wait you have to look like that for Valentine's Day date?
[3:02:35] shivwren: depends on where it is punctured and the size
[3:02:38] unknownnme_: how bad the hole is @cdewx
[3:02:39] magnaeus: cant be a hole in the sidewall
[3:02:39] Coachperkins: how close to the sidewall it is
[3:02:40] moldybread00: it depends on if its in sidewall or midd treat, mid treat can be patched
[3:02:40] huargothedream: how far into the side of the tread
[3:02:40] knappster15: Depends on deez nuts
[3:02:43] shamebadge: if it's on the edge sidewall they won't patch it
[3:02:43] mahz: Depends on the dmg
[3:02:45] koheed13: if it through the side wall
[3:02:48] xPraddaG: If it's in the sidewall you generally have to replace it
[3:02:49] kondal13: if the issue is on the side then you need to replace it
[3:02:49] koonakeenay: no if they cant fix it they replace it usually
[3:02:50] donoan: they can patch it in like minutes
[3:02:50] koheed13: then you;re god
[3:02:50] thinkablelol: depends on how big, if its on the side of the tire, automatic replacement
[3:02:51] moldybread00: obvious road dmg should be covered @cdewx
[3:02:53] Qmen000: tire tread. if low replace if not patch
[3:02:53] hvk_rhapsody: Depends on where, how large, and how clean the puncture
[3:02:56] shamebadge: is it in the center of the tire of the side of the treat?
[3:02:57] koheed13: I sell that stuff
[3:02:57] koonakeenay: like if you get a 60k mile warranty on tires from discount tire
[3:02:59] pharmztko: tire expert chat
[3:03:00] yukiaze: sidewall and tread
[3:03:02] koonakeenay: if they cant fix it they replace it
[3:03:03] shamebadge: tread
[3:03:06] koheed13: I'm and finance manager
[3:03:07] tesicxx: it depends where the hole is.  if its too close to the outside , sometimes they cant be plugged
[3:03:15] moldybread00: it depends on ur wheel offset replacing one tire if need be may incur a 4 tire replacement if you're awd
[3:03:22] kondal13: the plan is always a scam
[3:03:28] kondal13: for anything
[3:03:34] unknownnme_: atleast you dont have a street race car sitting on 305 Radials that cost 400$ a tire its insane @cdewx
[3:03:34] hvk_rhapsody: I grew up in Edison.  NJ is ass.
[3:03:35] koheed13: not ture
[3:03:46] moldybread00: they sell those plans everywhere
[3:03:59] MaroXZX: If it was a slow leak they may be able to patch it (if it is a nail or something) but if you hit a curb probably have to get a new tire
[3:04:08] moldybread00: u shouold be good
[3:04:22] xPraddaG: Did you bend the rim?
[3:04:25] ncro1337: what would u have done different in the finals in hindsight? @cdewx sry mby u answered this alrdy
[3:04:30] jasuvex: @kondal13 u just described insurance...its not a scam, its just how it works...majority pays for minority
[3:04:31] ncro1337: wp anyways
[3:04:33] moldybread00: if tire was obv dmged by road ur good- if whole tire needs replaced ur good if ur RWD, AWD needs all 4 @cdewx
[3:04:34] Ey_an: suing ur council?
[3:04:51] koheed13: tire and wheel coverage covers rim too
[3:04:55] kondal13: it is. if you think they are doing you a favor your wrong. theyt always make money off it. they woudnt do it if they lost money off of it
[3:04:57] koheed13: even for cosmetic
[3:05:07] knappster15: @ncro1337 won
[3:05:12] moldybread00: customer service for audi should be rly good
[3:05:18] moldybread00: luxury brands should be good
[3:05:29] iggy_pls: first thing to do when you buy a new car is change the tires cause they literally put the worse quality in them to get that warranty used up as fast as possible, I worked at a dealership for Volkswagen for 3 years can confirm
