[0:20:24] Artful_Dodger: Expecting a full on charm offensive  :P

[0:22:02] Kisswani: I will probably miss the announcement live because I will be eating FeelsBadMan
[0:22:53] DallTV_: towLets towGo
[0:22:55] KragnosWoW: guys the reveal is we wake up from a simulation and we have to do shadowlands alll over again because it was just a dream of the future so now we know not to kill the jailer and hear what he said the bigger threat was Kappa
[0:23:19] HazyThunder: I'll definitely miss it live because I have an interview, but that's what youtube is for.  I'll check it out after work.
[0:23:20] SpenceSir: not sure we'll get any info today but I care more about the systems than the story/lore.  Obviously hyped to hear what they have planned but look forward to hearing more about what game system they are going to introduce
[0:23:37] Jokervenom1978: The Bronze Dragonflight sends us back in time to do SL over again.
[0:23:42] Jewishraver: id also be okay with the exp being a year out if we get wrath today
[0:23:56] chaotikz7: @KragnosWoW Hey you, you're finnaly awake
[0:24:03] Kisswani: today ? now that's a full load of Hopium
[0:24:08] KragnosWoW: @chaotikz7 exactly! KEKW
[0:24:11] mmrghost7: all i care is we dont get another stat squish again
[0:24:29] S3N71: Morning all.  If pre-order is available straight after the reveal, who will be getting it?  I certainly will
[0:24:39] limitedbrains: Stat reforger? COPIUM
[0:24:39] Jewishraver: i got loads of hopium for this small indie company
[0:24:50] simonbgg: So how long do you guys recon the presentation/ announcement event will be? We usally get a whole blizzcon with panels and stuff so I would honestly be really disapointed if we just got a Youtube upload/vod.
[0:24:52] KragnosWoW: we wont get wrath today since it hasnt been beta tested yet
[0:24:59] Kisswani: I bought some bnet balance with tokens to at least buy the baisc version today @S3N71
[0:25:17] Typical_Cats: 10.0 presented by Microsoft Pog
[0:25:17] SpenceSir: @s3n71 not sure if I will preorder. depends if there's any perks attached.
[0:25:21] Vaedrun: @KragnosWoW It has been beta tested decades ago :D
[0:25:22] chaotikz7: @Jewishraver We need to preorder to help them grow Kappa
[0:25:45] Lokrosa: !music
[0:25:49] KragnosWoW: @Vaedrun yeah but its going to be wrath with changes not old school wrath
[0:25:53] Eradal: Does anyone have a link to the artist who did this art of Towelliee? It's incredible.
[0:25:57] simonbgg: @simonbgg Isn't that like less than the announcement of Blizzcon? (without panels etc)
[0:26:44] Typical_Cats: Is he going to watch the Asmon vs Ion debate? Kappa
[0:26:46] Kisswani: Nazjatar patch had a pre-recorded video of like 25 minutes . I would expect an expansion reveal to be longer than that
[0:27:01] mmrghost7: new spec for everyone hype
[0:27:02] gooni_coyg: HYPE!
[0:27:18] SpenceSir: is it possible Microsoft could sanction the hiring of more people to work on the expansion/give the team more resources? or will they not be involved at all?
[0:27:21] Artful_Dodger: I already have 50 alts.  :(
[0:27:29] Crowargus: hell yes
[0:27:30] simonbgg: @Kisswani Fair point, they should know where the expectations lay.
[0:27:40] ElicitYhoshii: does the event announcement come out at midnight or is it already out?
[0:28:07] chaotikz7: @ElicitYhoshii tommorow at 9 AM pst
[0:28:14] Artful_Dodger: In 9 hours 40ish minutes
[0:28:52] Eradal: Does anyone have a link to the artist who did this art of Towelliee?

[1:12:43] BlackCl0ud: so can you make like a combo of specs?
[1:12:47] Eregbueye: 10.2.5 with rip cord pulled already liked
[1:12:49] Orirholim: supposedly there's a press kit otu there, this could be from it I suppose
[1:12:50] WayneG947: so specs are being amalgamated
[1:12:51] Naethix: so a feral has to go all over to the right to get cyclone for pvp? @Towelliee
[1:12:58] stratiss: Looks like they’ve made it so you just pick what abilities u want
[1:12:59] dragonsmercy88: completely checked out the last 2 expansions but thinking about getting back into it.
[1:12:59] lukeymoo: the paw looks like ursine adept passive
[1:13:00] Xugodx2012: could be improved bear form
[1:13:02] CrimsonChaord: No matter how useful the choices are with a classic style tree, there will always be the meta. I guess I'm ok with it if you dont need a tome or to be rested anymore to reset, but still, I want choices to be impactful
[1:13:03] HazyThunder: Shockadins return?!
[1:13:06] giggz91: @Towelliee i think is like gaurdian ifinity
[1:13:07] c3llout7: are these leaked?
[1:13:10] danimoto10: new leak?
[1:13:11] BlackCl0ud: demo-affli warlocks where you at bros
[1:13:14] hk47_meatbag: looks like left side is general overall druid skills, and right side is specific to spec.
[1:13:19] restlesstornado_1: whats the timer for?
[1:13:24] Brandishblade: i cant tremember when did the talents change from tree to what we have now? was is MoP?
[1:13:26] liviu_81: skill  tree back? Pog
[1:13:28] Rudric_Ice: @c3llout7 yes
[1:13:29] CYNIC308: then go right and up into starsurge and moonkin
[1:13:30] king_waltzy: wildseed from night fae?
[1:13:30] MrKhanes: Looks like a modern version of the old talent trees
[1:13:34] itsapaul: Yeah left is overall, right is spec choice?
[1:13:35] Bokyko: hybrid build inc
[1:13:36] Dirtnose: @Brandishblade MoP yeah
[1:13:36] Lazugo: Look for the "talents" that have little arrows. they are the choosable ones
[1:13:49] Naethix: ferals have to go all over to the right to get cyclone for pvp? @Towelliee
[1:13:50] Sayryn: POE
[1:13:51] c3llout7: POG WRATH TALENTS
[1:13:56] Thoreya: Feel like that’s way too detailed to be fake
[1:13:58] bakurathewolf: can some one link me this plz?
[1:14:02] Orirholim: what if we get all the base abilities and the tree itself it just to enhance them all so we don't have to choose between abilities in talent trees anymore
[1:14:09] slaytanik1: yo
[1:14:15] slaytanik1: thatd be cool asf
[1:14:21] mrsuflakis: give us m+ talents
[1:14:26] dutchie76: it does
[1:14:26] xgombie: is this a leak?
[1:14:32] yuvalal: this is too complex ,
[1:14:33] hk47_meatbag: looks like a cross between the affinity stuff, and how they had the artifact abilites scaled.
[1:14:34] bakurathewolf: ya
[1:14:36] midagro: really hope this is real
[1:14:36] slaytanik1: i think its fabricated
[1:14:37] dracullatv: u will just put it to simcraft anyways KEKW
[1:14:38] king_waltzy: there is 3 even
[1:14:38] Brandishblade: one is for us the otehr for pocapo
[1:14:38] lukeymoo: im cool with watever they do; just less hard time gates
[1:14:40] simonbgg: I would be down for this. Looks really nice! :D
[1:14:40] slaytanik1: imo
[1:14:43] Xugodx2012: @Towelliee Gives Alternate Advancement Vibes from Everquest
[1:14:47] Reign_69: I’m hoping it’s real
[1:14:49] Sivedwar: maybe cause druid aswell .. only one with 4 speccs. interested to see another class
[1:14:49] posthumanxy: there is pvp/ratedbgs/pve/pve(raid/m+) so they give more option to see what u prefer and how u see combos
[1:14:51] Thoreya: Looks cool af
[1:14:52] Reign_69: I miss old talents
[1:14:53] KaisenSiru: Looks complicated. And people complained how Shadowlands was 'complicated"
[1:14:57] Dirtnose: Very interesting
[1:14:59] Thoreya: The dragon race leaked on the other hand…
[1:15:00] Orgabism: What is this???
[1:15:00] CYNIC308: the left trees are different???
[1:15:04] dutchie76: enhanced talent trees?
[1:15:04] Gurtogg: @brandishblade LUL
[1:15:06] Zettabyte: What we lookin' at? Just got out of the shower xD
[1:15:07] WayneG947: looks like u pick a primary spec and an offspec, ur primary has its own tree in the right? Kinda like multiclassing in DnD @towelliee
[1:15:08] Dirtnose: but yeah seems a tad complicated, especially by blizzard standards
[1:15:10] Sazzlles: One the other image it looks like a space filler for the convenant ability, because of the first screenshot thats convoke the spirits
[1:15:14] dracullatv: Aspect Power
[1:15:19] BlackCl0ud: the points come from the grind Kappa
[1:15:19] dutchie76: New Grind
[1:15:19] YungDizzY: AP

[1:15:29] Gustafvo: how long left until reveal?!
[1:15:29] Naethix: Asepct Power
[1:15:29] smiley7878: like in gw 2
[1:15:29] Texas_Mizfit: looks like covenant abilities stay in game
[1:15:31] luke238: aspect powerr
[1:15:32] dwarfmagee: you get them from farming neatherdrake eggs Kappa
[1:15:32] hk47_meatbag: I really want to know, if all those skills are acutally useful
[1:15:33] ZhortWoW: its lke the ESO / Diablo 3 leveling system i suppose
[1:15:33] mrsuflakis: pre cata talents
[1:15:34] Shaele: Skill Point Potions!
[1:15:34] Hastif: oh no
[1:15:37] king_waltzy: do your aspect quest every week for talent points DansGame
[1:15:37] shrektard69: What is the timer bottom left?
[1:15:38] Orirholim: @WayneG947 yeah that's what I'm thinking, base tree for class and the other tree is based on the spec
[1:15:38] itsapaul: Story points? :P
[1:15:38] yuvalal: achivmnts?
[1:15:40] grim777777: azerite power = points
[1:15:47] Thoreya: Maybe u do level but this is coming from something different
[1:15:50] jaysteea: it is Dick Power i mean Dragon Power Keepo
[1:15:52] typecero: Do you think they are plucking from talents to make this tree?
[1:15:53] Jarwerewolf: look like  end game
[1:15:54] dutchie76: inb4 timegated
[1:15:55] skoxxinator: i would love this system
[1:16:00] Reign_69: Call me crazy, but I miss an AP grind, just make it faster on alts
[1:16:05] BlackCl0ud: i don't really care where they come from as long as it's manageable
[1:16:09] CrimsonChaord: modern talents are not bad, but both can exist imo. I wouldn't wanna lose our current talents
[1:16:15] king_waltzy: this has the capability to let you change the appearance of spells if they added that since every spell is in the talent page
[1:16:17] dutchie76: wow
[1:16:17] lukeymoo: prob 60 points
[1:16:18] ceeotter: i wonder if the 1 is 1 ontop of already selecting it
[1:16:18] ambiganti: starting from the middle very unusual
[1:16:24] lukeymoo: id guess level cap = max points
[1:16:26] Blazer_6_6: every 2 levels a tp
[1:16:29] Blazer_6_6: ?
[1:16:29] gooni_coyg: no more borrow power.. only power from tier gear plz Blizzard!
[1:16:30] dragonsmercy88: kinda like ESOs CP system
[1:16:30] Orirholim: @chaos69697 AP grind just gives people something to grind in between content droughts and a powerful fantasy, i'm all for it
[1:16:32] Brandishblade: the more i think about it i do miss talent tree im kinda for it. wanna see a class that doesnt have 4 specs tho
[1:16:33] Texas_Mizfit: 1 point every 2 levels to 60
[1:16:33] Sazzlles: I imagine we'll start with some being level 60, likely not starting from 0
[1:16:42] Thoreya: I fuck with it!!!!
[1:16:43] Orirholim: power fantasy*
[1:16:49] Apokolipz: sad thing is if this is real  then alot of casual players will quit
[1:16:53] MVRD: 60
[1:16:55] simonbgg: So 1 point per level if we're level 60?
[1:16:58] BlackCl0ud: i just clicked, imagine you get restoration points based on how much you play the spec
[1:16:58] dutchie76: so you can be a tank and resto druid at the same time it looks like?
[1:17:08] posthumanxy: insta cast

[1:17:21] PanduhsTV: I just want the old talent tree
[1:17:24] Brandishblade: @Apokolipz idk theyd prob just google the cookie cutter like normal.

[1:17:40] dutchie76: i doubt we level to 70
[1:17:41] surpriseparty20: lvl 70 and it's after lvl 10 ?
[1:17:41] MVRD: this would be fucking amazing
[1:17:41] Elenagjika: if u unlock at lvl 10 u get to 70
[1:17:42] KingSlayerYotam: no rush to max lvl anymore
[1:17:44] Epixil: dont you get first pont level 10? so level 70 cap maybe?
[1:17:45] hk47_meatbag: time to grind Aspect power ... I could be wrong, but wouldn't be a poor bet.

[1:33:22] TooLock: @Towelliee those 5 fields that were encrypted in 9.2.5 appear to be pointing to a new race and more customization options (just generally) [6:08 AM] so its very likely pre-order bonus will be early race access

[1:41:40] NBK_Sethus: they need to find a way to merge old talent trees with Legion artifact trees
[1:41:44] CYNIC308: Path of Exile can do it other game can do it as well
[1:41:47] KingSlayerYotam: sometimes diablo like tree is confusing

[1:42:00] dutchie76: true
[1:42:02] KaisenSiru: Exactly. No substance to it like people think
[1:42:03] BlueBeast33: Where is this talent tree leak
[1:42:06] Whiskey_Corin: Yup, what im saying.
[1:42:08] dutchie76: vanilla had cookie cutter specs
[1:42:13] kingkind: @towelliee im just sick of the borrowed power shenanigans at this point, i wish they ditch that strat all over
[1:42:13] Electafuzz: people like the illusion of choice
[1:42:15] typecero: POE is "possiblities are endless". This don't look like that to me.
[1:42:15] dutchie76: yep
[1:42:21] dutchie76: shockadins
[1:42:25] A_Klimas: i just like options, when they had the old trees there were fringe builds that cropped up
[1:42:26] veeta1: it would be cool to have different content to do / different builds for that content
[1:42:35] KaisenSiru: Send those people to space
[1:42:36] Zettabyte: #NoChanges Kappa
[1:42:37] iTzChamb0: @Towelliee do you think its worth coming back to the game ?

[1:42:53] rymerre: its the illusion of choice...having the option to have options is what people want
[1:43:03] dutchie76: cataylst

[1:47:14] Blvdman: sounds overly complicated for that power
[1:47:45] yuvalal: where is the countdown to the reveal?
[1:47:51] Gurtogg: yes wotlk classic will be last but they make new content for it
[1:47:57] typecero: yeah the last one sounds complicated unnecessarily
[1:48:26] xxsargexx: ehhh i dunno about new content for it
[1:48:36] Sprowa: Do you think they will add this for next expansion or it's just a end of seasons thing?

[1:51:04] Jarwerewolf: haha
[1:51:07] simonbgg: Do you think we will only get a shorter vid/vod today or will there be a longer announcement event where they go more in depth? Would be disapointed if we only got vid/vod. @Towelliee
[1:51:12] kingkind: Revamp all the classes, change rotations, add new spells, remove some boring ones or change them up and u’ve already got an expac worth playing. Then come the rest

[1:51:43] stykri1: @kingkind no class design in 9.2 is so good
[1:51:54] trivotix: I think that this means the xpac won't be released for a long time
[1:52:11] dutchie76: 2023

[1:53:37] BlackCl0ud: wrath later this year, next expansion next year
[1:53:38] simonbgg: Thats a long content draught where they just put affixes on raids & call it a new season.
[1:53:39] Cristiex2012: Didnt one of the more believeable leakers say release will be Late November/Early December?
[1:53:46] SunjammerIV: the fucked production pipeline that created 9 month shadowlands patches has not been fixed yet
[1:53:48] zevisx: Do you think we will get classic expansion announcement today as well?
[1:53:48] rymerre: will there be a pvp season 4 then?
[1:53:51] king_waltzy: wrath is q4 so not happenin
[1:53:52] Blvdman: if they really wanted to make it up to us they'd get it done
[1:53:52] KragnosWoW: people confuse copoum with hopium KEKW
[1:53:55] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee i noticed that last 5 expansions every one of them had 3 big raids and 1 small exept WOD and SL monkaS
[1:54:02] MrKhanes: I can see a Wrath classic this year and the expansion next year
[1:54:04] Kaype92: Look I literally couldn’t care less what theme the expansion is, it could be vulpera and furries for all I care just for the love of everything make a good expansion again
[1:54:08] Anddroiden_: so what are the chances that the moon will be a zone?

[1:54:30] Rudric_Ice: @Cristiex2012 thats the guy who leaked the legion dh class and also the cinematic pic
[1:54:31] Blvdman: I lowkey hope its not dragon isle so the shock on everyones face is even better for the reveal
[1:54:37] agev2019: @Towelliee i wonder how soon the expan will be since we pretty much did everything in Shadowlands
[1:54:38] Knaxxis: why woudlnt there be a pvp season 4? talk about a clueless individual in chat
[1:54:40] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think we get s4 and also a November release
[1:54:49] TooLock: got 29 genesis yesterday
[1:54:55] worldfamousfart: Holy shit this game has been out forever. I didn’t realize it’s gonna be twenty years soon
[1:54:55] Lexi__Marie: Olea Caches now drop Genesis Motes in addition to (was instead of) another Protoform Synthesis component.
[1:55:01] efthimi0s: wrath classic is november

[1:55:07] rbayduden: HE KNOWS

[1:55:13] dracullus: obviously first they have to release 9.2.5
[1:55:16] fowlentv: you got your 9 leggos on towelie
[1:55:22] BlackCl0ud: wrath classic in nov i think
[1:55:32] ZhortWoW: But hopefully we'll get a longer alpha/beta cycle compared to previous expanions, to allow the devs time to actually react to feedback. @Towelliee
[1:55:38] SisterblissUK: @rbayduden dosnt take much brain power to work out beta and alpha times :)
[1:55:39] dutchie76: 9.2.5 in June imo
[1:55:48] denflup: they are rushing last phase of TBC classic, so they can get WOTLK classic before the end of the year
[1:55:48] Zettabyte: @Towelliee We ned a Lego Warcraft game Kappa
[1:55:54] Zettabyte: need*
[1:55:58] TooLock: @Towelliee 29 yesterday
[1:56:01] the_general01: i got like 60
[1:56:05] Patadot: I think from the announcement we will understand how far they are in the developement and make a guess, for SL for example thay ha very little to show if nothing
[1:56:08] skoxxinator: it contained before the prepatch around 30
[1:56:09] PharoGames: you think we get a release date? or just a year?
[1:56:10] agev2019: @Towelliee so, do you think they will expect us to just sit around pretty much til like almost next year doing nothing til pre-path?
[1:56:12] skoxxinator: hotfix*
[1:56:15] agev2019: @Towelliee pre-patch*
[1:56:30] szble: need them to read feedback first
[1:56:30] ThePawPaw: anyone said BETA keys AYAYABASS
[1:56:34] Orirholim: @PharoGames we'll see a release date tomorrow, pretty sure
[1:56:36] dutchie76: Wrath Classic will be Nov/Dec imo
[1:56:37] LeBigNose: 👀
[1:56:38] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee do you think they hit us with any curve balls lol
[1:56:42] Praetour: Whether tehy take feedback in the alpha/beta as well, can take longer if they decide to act on feedback this time
[1:56:51] chrslp: Better stock up on your juices Towelliee. Some new law just passed
[1:56:52] SisterblissUK: I honestly think blizz will go all out with the reveal,its going to be hit after hit
[1:57:02] typecero: Everyone thought we were gonna have a 9.3 as well... how did that go.
[1:57:05] ZhortWoW: well. 9.2.5 is the time for them to test systems
[1:57:13] dutchie76: no way
[1:57:17] swoopdawooshh: im ok with them taking their time

[1:57:49] ZhortWoW: They likely have to be fair.. Shadowlands was scrapped for the most part before it even launched.. - yet even with that, i dont see it launching this year.
[1:57:50] reformedalex12345: im happy it comes sooner because classic wrath sooner Pog
[1:57:51] Erielle04: They have just had 2 bad expansions in a row, it will be a longer cycle

[1:58:40] szble: yeah tbcc is dead bro 󠀀 󠀀
[1:58:41] dutchie76: true
[1:58:47] romann921: we got a lot of wrath babies
[1:58:51] TheodredCaelzara: i dont think they will bring 10.0 this year. but i can imagine 11.0 to be forced for Nov 24 becoz  of 20 Years and 10th Expansion. @Towelliee

[1:59:30] dutchie76: lol
[1:59:36] Motivess: wrath is more casual than retail and I like that
[1:59:36] coldhandsbeatz: I think no release will ever top 2019 Classic. That was too much it was everywhere. Classic is no longer a novelty so its hard to have that hype again
[1:59:39] dutchie76: halls of lightning too
[1:59:40] Cafe0le: more stills from the cinematic keep leaking i should stay away from mmo-c but dont have the strenght

[2:00:44] dutchie76: ruby sanctum was in Wrath LUL
[2:00:47] ZhortWoW: We all knew Wrath would be announced today aswell though.. as its the future of warcraft, and not just Retail
[2:00:54] itsapaul: Ruby sanctum was before cata right
[2:01:03] Rudric_Ice: they wont announce wrath today
[2:01:08] dutchie76: plus you have Trial of Valor
[2:01:09] Niksen_99: Look at SOM... Classic dont need changes
[2:01:10] tennerys: yo Towelliee what are your plans for the next 8 hours?

[2:01:31] xxsargexx: @king_waltzy disgusting
[2:01:36] efthimi0s: its being rushed because bill gates wants that boost money baby
[2:01:40] ciwaciwah: @Towelliee if you could wish for 1 thing in wow to be changed, what would you want changed?

[2:01:52] EASanDiego: you already know what's gonna be announced
[2:01:52] ILikeKillTheZombies: i will probably not be happy with these dragons :D
[2:01:54] coldhandsbeatz: After Wrath is done I hope they just keep 1-2 classic versions up like vanilla+ and wrath or something like that. They cant keep splitting the playerbase more and more
[2:01:55] ILikeKillTheZombies: race
[2:01:57] KragnosWoW: i just want to make 1 friend in wow FeelsBadMan

[2:03:18] Doomsaga: im expecting early 2023 at the earliest
[2:03:40] xxsargexx: always a good time leveling in the early days of an expansion
[2:03:42] vexxalex121: amazing WQ mechanics am i rite
[2:03:47] dracullus: how it's being lucky, Christmas expac release would mean unfinished buggy mess for sure
[2:03:52] Praetour: @Doomsaga I'm expecting early April 2022 at the earliest
[2:03:52] coldhandsbeatz: Stop it with the rational thoughts and facts pls

[2:04:38] swoopdawooshh: let them take longer, make it amazing
[2:04:41] TooLock: @Towelliee maybe it will be shorted cause we had no blizzcon
[2:04:42] Pilha390: @Towelliee would you play a shammy tank?
[2:04:43] xxsargexx: @xotankkk shes a bowl of fruit sorry Kappa
[2:04:44] YungDizzY: its gonna be longer because of covid
[2:04:51] Doomsaga: march/april sounds about right

[2:04:52] Praetour: First ultra 4k resolution cinematic of Alexstrasza pog
[2:04:53] Yagr6: that would be a streamer only thing
[2:04:54] king_waltzy: rip blizzcon :(
[2:04:54] MetalManGG: I personally dont really care about the setting or the lore, I just want the gameplay to be tight, account wide everything like Lost Ark and Class Skins would be cool but not 100% needed
[2:05:01] Erielle04: If blizzard were to bring out the best expansion ever, some people would still shit on it no matter what
[2:05:03] Rudric_Ice: which aspect you going with towellie if there's no power attached to it.
[2:05:04] denflup: remember when there was a classic demo in 2018? that was awesone
[2:05:05] KragnosWoW: @dracullus careful, if those wow haters could read theyd be upset
[2:05:07] denflup: awesome*
[2:05:12] Richton867: I heard Bill Gates is personally working on 10.0 and will be ready next week.
[2:05:13] EASanDiego: demo confirmed
[2:05:13] ZhortWoW: Imagine the un-announced twitch prime loot for WoW actually being a beta key. IonJam @Towelliee
[2:05:14] Grunton: i cant see shadowlands lasting another year
[2:05:17] Andorthas: It seems like they abandoned Shadowlands very early though and started to focus on next expansion, so even though November seems early I think it is very possible.
[2:05:21] Noshpan: I would like grinding for alts to be fast
[2:05:25] king_waltzy: youd never go back
[2:05:26] FengornTwitch: @Towelliee Blizzcon could come to UK we dont have restrictions anymore
[2:05:26] coldhandsbeatz: Do you think Dragonflight will be Legion level good? It came after WoD and what it meant for WoW.. not the same but kind of similar situation to now
[2:05:31] Rudric_Ice: oh yea Black dragons FTW
[2:05:32] Eregbueye: Id go red for booba
[2:05:34] i_cassius: and not go back
[2:05:35] Blvdman: Bronze rise up
[2:05:35] tennerys: yeah shadowlands feels very half baked... i mean 9.1 was pretty bad
[2:05:38] deadman385: Damn @towelliee I can’t sleep
[2:05:40] Demanisraar: I go bronze
[2:05:51] king_waltzy: i go pink
[2:05:56] Noshpan: I'd go blue because blue is my favorite color
[2:06:00] swoopdawooshh: blue cuz my cat's name is Kalecgos
[2:06:01] KragnosWoW: i go whichever has the coolest mog
[2:06:05] ZhortWoW: @FengornTwitch They're never holding blizzcon anywhere but Anaheim. its too big of an event for them to not do it near headquarters
[2:06:05] Naethix: I bet they nerfed booba tho
[2:06:07] Djfarmville: Blue Malygos gang
[2:06:12] Xugodx2012: @Towelliee I wonder if Rogues that did the Cata Dagger Quest Would get Extra Dialog with Wrathion in the black dragon faction
[2:06:14] legobind: the one and only thing i want them so say is they are going to build this like bc and wrath was
[2:06:23] Eithos87: I slept from noon till 3am
[2:06:23] Sniper_Penguin: Green cuz i really like all the emerald dream lore
[2:06:29] Zzorski: Zzorski subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! murloc expack hyppers in the chat
[2:06:32] Rudric_Ice: sock on head incoming
[2:06:33] tennerys: those gamer glasses putting in work absolutely
[2:06:36] Tambandia: and then we fade into the void
[2:06:41] efthimi0s: so they really are following the formula aye, bfa = vanilla, legion = tbc, shadowlands = wrath, dragonflight = cata.......cant wait for pandas 2.0 :)
[2:06:44] Vizzkara: @Towelliee  can you recommend any tequilas
[2:06:46] Niksen_99: I bought Bulletit bourbon the other day pretty good
[2:06:47] Dax0n3: @Towelliee i might try to schedule my rotator cuff surgery with the launch of WOTLK so im off work to play XD
[2:06:52] vexxalex121: do you think there is a higher chance for new class or 4th spec?
[2:06:59] Fubarlogixx: what time does it actually start
[2:07:07] KragnosWoW: my prescription glasses help with blue light protection im good
[2:07:12] TooLock: @Towelliee how long is the blizzard event?
[2:07:16] FengornTwitch: @Towelliee Bellular war machine firing up!
[2:07:21] Fubarlogixx: oh shit due lmao im a dubass
[2:07:26] ZhortWoW: @Towelliee If we actually get Dragonflight with the talent system and such thats been leaked, im gonna treat Dragonflight as the spiritual successor to Wrath/Cata
[2:07:26] Fubarlogixx: duh*
[2:07:33] tennerys: is Ion Hazzikostas gonna show up? what happened to him?
[2:07:38] swoopdawooshh: prolly at least 45 mins

[2:09:35] ZhortWoW: @tennerys He's likely too busy.. I'd imagine he's pretty much working around the clock to make sure dragonflight isnt going to be a shitshow.. Gotta remember he's still doing alot of developement himself too
[2:09:39] mogil_22: Cant wait for Dragonflight to turn out to be the mobile game name

[2:12:57] cappei: Happy about a new talent system; been asking for this since the last few expansions. Core design needs a shake-up in my opinion, gotten really stale as of recent years
[2:12:58] Lazugo: todya is gonna be huge
[2:12:59] dracullus: *live audience
[2:13:14] xxsargexx: @mrrazputin how long hes been live

[2:13:19] m0rtumk: please blizzard give some love for UH DKs prayge

[2:13:58] Bazsidiver: what if dragon leaks are fake?
[2:14:09] tennerys: is it true that the development team dropped work on Shadowlands to go all in on Dragonflight?
[2:14:11] swoopdawooshh: im really trying to be positive
[2:14:13] littleofc1: @Towelliee what do u hope expansion will be?
[2:14:14] Noshpan: Livestream event *NOT* filmed in front of a live audience.
[2:14:15] Talason: Talason subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! im subbing for the towelliee hype
[2:14:17] Phobion: @towelliee Hot damn the Drac'thyr could be so awesome but I fear it could be worgen 2.0 Sadge
[2:14:19] Erielle04: @Bazsidiver the blizzard website one isn't
[2:14:20] ZhortWoW: @Collected1 Cant blame you.. WoD was just a filler expansion that has had no effect on the rest of the game so far.
[2:14:24] Dax0n3: @Towelliee how much insider information you got?
[2:14:47] tennerys: HOLY SH*T
[2:14:49] swoopdawooshh: i really do think they can do it
[2:14:50] MMokuin: better then legion?
[2:14:53] tennerys: better than Legion?? tall order man

[2:14:57] MarquisLek: DRAGON HYPE !
[2:14:57] ILikeKillTheZombies: i feel like we will get no class or new race
[2:14:58] skymercii: @Bazsidiver rule of thumb when it comes to leaks: take it with a grain of salt
[2:15:00] XshadowturkeyX: thats a tall order
[2:15:02] Collected1: clip it chat
[2:15:04] Sprowa: I don't know legion had new class and mythic plus on top of that

[2:15:11] coldhandsbeatz: Thats rough. Legion was amazing
[2:15:12] NBK_Sethus: huh LUL
[2:15:14] Fubarlogixx: did that twitch chick invest in blizzard to or am i buggin?
[2:15:15] Deadly26: nothings ever gonna beat Legion. all those people who made pugs fun are gone.
[2:15:17] TwitchGurls: how long to REVEAL???
[2:15:18] RagingPunk: Hype starting Pog
[2:15:20] littleofc1: clip it and ship it
[2:15:21] swoopdawooshh: i think they have a better team and leadership, and better changes will happen
[2:15:21] tennerys: i mean after seeing back to back BFA and Shadowlands I've kinda lost hope
[2:15:22] simonbgg: Imagine if Mike Ybarra announced 10.0, would be nice! :D
[2:15:23] deadman385: Than legion? Watch your mouth sir
[2:15:23] Talason: towHAMUP hammer time
[2:15:26] Brandishblade: i hope ur right i really do
[2:15:28] cappei: Sorry, Ion still there LuL Yeah yeah, not all his fault, blah blah, heard it before
[2:15:28] MarquisLek: NEW LEADERSHIP HYPE !
[2:15:30] Typical_Cats: grade A Hopium
[2:15:38] simonbgg: I would be down for that!
[2:15:42] dracullus: it's not that hard, Legion had a lot of mistakes and don't even get me started on alts
[2:15:45] tennerys: KEKW TRUE
[2:15:49] ZhortWoW: i'd be hype for mike ybarra, not gonna lie.
[2:15:51] Zettabyte: Garbage like Bobby Cuntick
[2:15:51] Knaxxis: big true
[2:15:51] bawheid: what makes you say that? blizz have been a dumpster fire for too long, 10 could go either way
[2:15:51] Rudric_Ice: mine is 0
[2:15:52] swoopdawooshh: what if they have orderhalls (like for classes) but for the different dragons. it would be amazing
[2:15:52] littleofc1: how dare you
[2:15:57] Knaxxis: chat is full of talkers not doers
[2:15:58] rybreadgg: @Towelliee I have the same mindset as you, it really won't take much to excite me. I'm not asking for a lot just make me excited to play the game without havign to jump through hoops
[2:16:03] KragnosWoW: m+ isnt pugable so he prob runs with friends
[2:16:04] Rasghoul: S class baby
[2:16:07] Ghamera: what dragon mount is that, the pink one with horns?
[2:16:07] deadman385: Excuse ME
[2:16:15] Brandishblade: I just hope the story is good tbh. im too invested to say id quick from bad gameplay
[2:16:21] tennerys: if Dragonflight can surpass Legion I'm all in
[2:16:24] coldhandsbeatz: Im hoping for no leveling. Make every zone Suramar level good. At this point those levels are for nothing.
[2:16:31] Djfarmville: Blue magic copium
[2:16:31] sunmx: hey! im 2.7k  LUL
[2:16:37] ZhortWoW: @Ghamera Life-binders Maiden i believe

[2:16:45] tennerys: John is really good for announcing WoW Classic
[2:16:46] Rudric_Ice: what about Danuser Kappa
[2:16:49] FOQUZ_TV: "m+ isn't puggable" I've been pugging 25s with ease
[2:16:51] xxsargexx: i just want to level in a new expansion, always a good time
[2:16:54] Praetour: Metzen will do it
[2:16:57] Ghamera: thanks chat!
[2:17:01] littleofc1: u think we will get tbc fresh ?
[2:17:02] Chuckforfun: I think mike
[2:17:04] cappei: @Towelliee Did you see the new cinematic leaks on Mmo-champion? Otherwise I can link them
[2:17:04] swoopdawooshh: they have to know that Legion was their best expansion, and to not go back to that would be a huge mistake for them. i believe they'll give us something good
[2:17:05] xotankkk: Steve denuser
[2:17:06] DrNox__: Mike or riot
[2:17:08] ILikeKillTheZombies: Sylvanas VO will do it

[2:17:13] Chuckforfun: AFter a long time Metzen is coming back LUL
[2:17:18] Talason: towKawaii
[2:17:20] Brandishblade: Get Mr T to annouce it. would be epic and nostalgic
[2:17:21] coldhandsbeatz: Ion isnt the best hypeman either lol
[2:17:26] Rudric_Ice: Metzen Back Pog
[2:17:27] Noshpan: @Rudric_Ice A chakram-using class like XIV's Dancer. That would be interesting.
[2:17:33] skymercii: what is season of mastery?
[2:17:35] Niksen_99: SOM TBC?? That sounds horrible
[2:17:42] reformedalex12345: SOM LUL
[2:17:43] ciwaciwah: @Noshpan necrolord hunter kekw

[2:17:59] tennerys: i actually playing SOM because 9.1 was that bad LUL
[2:18:02] Talason: i wanna buy a wrath boost

[2:18:03] Rudric_Ice: wrath battle pass
[2:18:07] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee can we just get Ion an actual microphone, dude's been using the same headset since Wrath for his annoucements
[2:18:12] sunmx: is season of mastery doing good?
[2:18:14] Orirholim: @RatonulMahmur the UI Developer said he'd be excited to see our reactions today, so there's that

[2:19:10] VSlayerMc: what are your predictions?
[2:19:14] Talason: maybe holinka
[2:19:16] coldhandsbeatz: Make some classic versions free to play. Having 5 versions of classic and 3-4 of them being mostly dead isnt sustainable for the future
[2:19:22] N3llee: has Lore announced his new gig yet?
[2:19:23] ZhortWoW: it might be a livestream, but its definately filmed already..
[2:19:23] skymercii: @ciwaciwah i miss my SV hunter but i dont like the state of the game atm so thats a big reason im not playing

[2:20:01] Colt_Engineer: do we not have phones?
[2:20:05] TwitchGurls: do u think your SV hunter misses you??
[2:20:06] tennerys: they shouldve predicted COVID and announced Diablo Immortal at virtual Blizzcon
[2:20:07] nvnto: hello prerecorded towelliee BBYodaS
[2:20:12] ZhortWoW: @coldhandsbeatz Livestreams usually say "planned" so yeah
[2:20:13] Orirholim: @fidele2022 ? cringe
[2:20:15] bawheid: can we expect a drunk cubicle crawl mini game in 10.0?
[2:20:19] VSlayerMc: do you think it will be only the cinematic and gameplay trailer or are they also gonna do a bit of a deep dive?

[2:36:45] ciwaciwah: i hope we get a beta date if anything today
[2:36:46] Qargory: later this yr
[2:36:47] stjon13: but we had more content patches

[2:39:20] MVRD: December LULW 󠀀 󠀀
[2:39:21] TwitchGurls: when is wrath coming out
[2:39:21] zodd_amhai: not gona happen KEKW
[2:39:24] Murlock07: doubt it tho
[2:39:27] madhatterui: there is a first for everything
[2:39:28] MikeyGy: ye thisyear release is hopium
[2:39:29] larrylegend36: fire it up baby!!!!
[2:39:30] luckfore: put the copium down chat
[2:39:30] Krait06: yeah no shot
[2:39:33] Electafuzz: no way it's gonna happen
[2:39:34] Murlock07: 2023
[2:39:37] Mortal_Wombat_: personally, i dont care how long it takes.. just make a good expansion. i want to love it again
[2:39:37] SamboneTV: Hopium
[2:39:37] Shrandamar: You dont want it to be early, it'll make the game worse
[2:39:38] silverplay1304: They released dragon xpac in 3 years
[2:39:39] skittleguzzler: Poopium
[2:39:41] littleofc1: THink positive!!!
[2:39:43] Electafuzz: omega level hopium
[2:39:44] YungDizzY: with covid still a thing? hell naw
[2:39:45] Ghamera: I want quality over speed
[2:39:47] lithium364: i kinda dig the new race
[2:39:48] ZakuzaGB: if it does come out this year it will be december 31st haha
[2:39:48] Teddsan: there is no way the WoW team can handle a shorter expansion release after covid / lay offs
[2:39:50] OsyrissTV: Yo Towelliee, do you think certain covenant abilties should end up replacing a dead talent for certain specs? Or maybe a spell that works in a similar fashion for some classes?
[2:39:52] szble: i guess we'll see 󠀀 󠀀
[2:39:52] Sniper_Penguin: kind of depends on how much they've worked on it.. they seemed to have ditched shadowlands early imo
[2:39:52] murazzond: @NVNTO so it will take 10 years for 10.0, you fine?
[2:39:53] HosseinReGoX: I'm happy with waiting if we get a good xpac
[2:39:56] silverplay1304: @ShrandaTV it was late and still its bad
[2:40:01] Ghamera: get it properly alpha/beta tested
[2:40:02] Fubarlogixx: if they are gonna fuck it up uts dioens tmater when lol \
[2:40:02] Lazugo: https://pasteboard.co/sv0kWAp1kIEH.jpg @Towelliee one more for you t man
[2:40:04] coldhandsbeatz: What I want the most out of Dragonflight is consistency. Legion gave us a patch every 77 days or even less. They have to go back to that kind of schedule. That contributed so much to Legion being amazing
[2:40:08] jrooke1992: Are Legion Raids easily soloable yet?
[2:40:09] Talason: towCry
[2:40:14] dwolters_the_zombieman: yep
[2:40:16] Knaxxis: if u thikn the expanison is coming out lakter this year, I got some swamp land to sell u sight unseen in Arizona
[2:40:23] ciwaciwah: the wow community is one of the most toxic and loving communities at the same time
[2:40:28] Finsby_: @Towelliee There might be a slight chance - just because Shadowlands was so poorly recieved and they might've moved on to Dragonflight earlier
[2:40:29] MikeyGy: yea wait for anbother water you can walk on Kappa
[2:40:32] Jarwerewolf: 500 day +
[2:40:32] Finsby_: Just a reach
[2:40:34] SamboneTV: gor Kek
[2:40:36] TwitchGurls: as long as wrath comes out this year iam happy
[2:40:49] Talason: bashing wow = more views
[2:40:53] Ghaark: when is the announcement gonna be?
[2:40:56] Chuckforfun: Wrath in q3
[2:40:58] jimmy_from_the_ghetto: more likely to come out in 2023
[2:40:58] OsyrissTV: Cheer100 Yo Towelliee, do you think certain covenant abilties should end up replacing a dead talent for certain specs? Or maybe a spell that works in a similar fashion for some classes??
[2:41:02] szble: pasteboard link is good
[2:41:22] Eregbueye: Ion BibleThump
[2:41:25] cappei: More Scarizard-level communication
[2:41:26] Erielle04: Give the man a break
[2:41:35] DwarfWarrior25: what we need and wont is more content in a patch and expansion
[2:41:35] geokouts: i HOPE they dont say the new power system DP :P
[2:41:55] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:41:58] Teddsan: or maybe listen to the feedback beta testers gave on systems
[2:41:59] idenkaz_: yeah that guy was a thing. he existed :D
[2:42:06] Mortal_Wombat_: more directing, less talking NODDERS
[2:42:15] Erielle04: @Teddsan They will
[2:42:18] Talason: towelliee should be the community manager for wow
[2:42:18] dutchie76: hope i get a good Vault this week
[2:42:25] Cafe0le: blizzard had good comms during sl beta but they stopped after launch tho
[2:42:28] geokouts: or worse Dragon Aspect Power aka DAP :P
[2:42:34] scratches16: if only they could bring back Jeff From The Overwatch Team
[2:42:34] Talason: lol
[2:42:40] idenkaz_: KEKW pls god no
[2:42:43] Electafuzz: nobody gets paid enough to take that job
[2:42:53] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i'll miss Lore alot tho :(
[2:42:58] ZakuzaGB: rest in josheronis
[2:43:28] Krait06: classic blizz
[2:43:31] luckfore: they listened to the wrong ppl with 9.2 feedback
[2:43:36] Xugodx2012: "Meaningful" Choices
[2:43:38] murazzond: "meaninful choices" LUL
[2:43:53] Electafuzz: people were excited for meaningful choices?
[2:43:57] PomegranateOfPain: @Teddsan it always hurts to see beta bugs make it to release, on top of genreal bugs... but dev releases aint easy
[2:44:03] s_t_o_r_m__: yeah
[2:44:06] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  YUP LMAO
[2:44:06] MikeyGy: yall just wait for 10.0 meaningful choces with that laugh Kappa
[2:44:07] s_t_o_r_m__: that was sad
[2:44:10] scratches16: "wowhead told me to choose this -- it's super meaningful" LUL
[2:44:28] Traexler: I must have been the only person who just picked a covenant and was happy with it, not giving a shit about not being able to swap :P
[2:44:31] syberiian: !uc
[2:44:35] syberiian: !ui
[2:44:35] Moobot: @Touchofice TBC UI: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25206-TowellieesTBCClassicElvUICompilation169.html |SL UI: wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[2:44:44] sprert: people were excited for the "ripcord"
[2:44:53] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  Preach was disheartened after the interviews XD
[2:44:55] SamboneTV: people dont actually know how its going to be until they play it
[2:45:03] MarquisLek: if the covenants didn't have the time gating on the renown and the lack of flexibility it would have been fine
[2:45:07] ztnook95: mornin Tow! You think they gonna merge a torghast system with caverns of time or similar? if drake exman
[2:45:08] Arthur_eld: it was a mixed reaction. There was a lot of arguing about it
[2:45:08] Teddsan: i still remember sloot and preach begging blizz to change covenant choices in interviewrs lol
[2:45:16] liviu_81: up is down and so on
[2:45:17] ciwaciwah: @scratches16 a lot of classes have multiple viable covenants within very few % of each others. It's just the mindset of minmaxing that's causing people to pick the best one over a 0,01% worse one they like more
[2:45:20] Erielle04: Hopefully 10.0 will break the cycle
[2:45:22] Blvdman: people thought it was going to be purely cosmetic
[2:45:23] Jacorvin: Blizzard needs to adhere to the old saying, "Keep it simple." Tired off these complicated systems that just end up failing.
[2:45:36] Finsby_: @Towelliee I think ¨meaningful choices' can be cool if it's cosmetic or maybe utility based, but not like covenants
[2:45:37] Saltytyphoon: dis diss disc 0
[2:45:49] nvnto: I loved the phrase "we're just gonna balance it" when it came to issues brought up with covenants
[2:45:55] ZakuzaGB: it will never pan out well if dps metres are a thing haha
[2:46:02] Electafuzz: but there is no ripcord LUL
[2:46:07] cappei: @Towelliee Can I link you the newest race leak?
[2:46:12] liviu_81: monkaHmm
[2:46:14] Talason: towelliee are you going black dragonflight?

[2:46:39] Teddsan: this is like the 3rd expansion where the system becomes playable and fun at the end of it which sucks ass
[2:46:39] Mortal_Wombat_: sadly, i really can't anymore. but i want to
[2:46:40] MarquisLek: the dragon hype is getting to you

[2:46:54] nephttv_: @Towelliee Im on the hopium train than prot warr will be good again
[2:46:59] Sereannon: won't happen if they keep using these borrowed power systems
[2:47:00] garkhyt: BOA system from start will be a real change at start of xpac
[2:47:01] mikejames01: @Cappaie he saw it
[2:47:03] curlytopcoffee: What now?

[2:48:18] Teddsan: blizz barely recognizes their own streams u want them to sponsor streamers LUL
[2:48:23] Saltytyphoon: no
[2:48:24] scratches16: blizz has trouble paying their own employees and they think streamers are sponsored LUL

[2:49:24] KingSlayerYotam: Like what will you even do as a paid wow job? mythic +? farming renown?
[2:49:31] coldhandsbeatz: @poltergeist1995 that would be so cool. Expand caverns of time into a torghast like place where you revive old story moments and get cool (cosmetic) rewards
[2:49:34] Dirtnose: @Zzorski Mixer died like 3 years ago didnt it?
[2:49:52] Hesuy: Chat, I havn’t played in like 3 years, did they bring back PVP gear that actually is better for pvp than pve gear?

[2:51:10] Stevenseagullol: love that ducksauce is back to streaming again even tho it isnt wow

[2:52:05] Saltytyphoon: hydra pet pls
[2:52:12] KragnosWoW: no i just dont buy wow tokens @Demanisraar
[2:52:20] MrGattz: yeah runescape tokens for gametime are 14 day
[2:52:28] Blvdman: its understandable why they  wont sponsor streamers, the pay vs the streamer to sub conversion probably would never be profitable

[2:56:25] Teddsan: if its dragons there will be a fuckton of old gods shit
[2:56:27] Naethix: Void and Light against us
[2:56:30] Stonefather: Well technically it's Arcane but you could argue Arcane is more alligned with light.
[2:56:31] MrGattz: np!
[2:56:40] EASanDiego: since vanilla
[2:56:40] Mozzeyy_: Voideez nuts

[2:57:16] ztnook95: in Zeret Mortis, the oracle mentions "dragonic" as a language which we havent seen in game for a long time
[2:57:19] coldhandsbeatz: I wouldnt mind Void vs Light things but instead of Shadowlands cosmic shit, we would have it via Lordaeron, Turalyon, Alleria, the Scarletts, etc. That would be so cool
[2:57:19] Vezri96: wouldn't mind n'zoth coming back tbh :D

[2:57:30] DwarfWarrior25: I really hope if we get a new zone its a nice sized one
[2:57:31] EASanDiego: what if the dragon isles is on galakronds back
[2:57:33] luckfore: theres alot of space there
[2:57:34] Crazdmadman: after shadowlands...does "old blizzard" lore actually mean anything?
[2:57:43] dankmeliodas: In Warcraft rts the maps showed them north of Quel’thalas
[2:57:44] Blvdman: dragon isles expac gunna have the easist raid bosses ever 100%. Dodge tail swipe, dodge breath, watch for wing slam
[2:57:53] Akermay: Busy half of the map. No one want to float by Kalimdor? :D

[3:11:25] Synckery: cata worse than SL!?
[3:11:25] Anbean: @Towelliee you thing they will allow pre-order after the announcment?
[3:11:26] MrGharr: has the casual challenge started?

[3:11:32] Sicknessqt: KEKW
[3:11:35] Finsby_: Oh, Cata was way better than Shadowlands IMO
[3:11:38] SamboneTV: for me shadowlands was the worst
[3:11:39] holychief26: Have you raided much in shadowlands towellie? I think the raid was kinda good. Just nothing to do outside of it.
[3:11:41] Finsby_: not even clise
[3:11:42] Finsby_: close*
[3:11:46] Pallananana: pitchfork down boys, false alarm

[3:12:37] Praetour: Towelliee's favourite was WoD for sure
[3:12:40] holychief26: @Twitchgurls debatable - it only rates so highly because of it ties to lore
[3:12:41] Sniper_Penguin: Panda, Legion, Wrath top 3 for me
[3:12:45] vaironixx: I think exploring the new azeroth in cata was one of the coolest things to come from an expac
[3:12:51] SamboneTV: @bloodyreapr wod is underrated, didnt have a lot of content but i thought it was good
[3:13:06] booniesandbag: Can you say your list?
[3:13:07] Nelyu: top 3 expansions are? :)
[3:13:10] geokouts: btw i dont think there will ever be a player housing. Garissons in future maybe but not player housing like all want
[3:13:23] fowlentv: I thought bfa was pretty good tbh once 8.2 hit
[3:13:27] ryanwcar: cataclysm is my favorite.  probably the most balanced pvp ever in WoW
[3:13:28] Akermay: Not enough people asking when underwater zones are making a comback
[3:13:31] SamboneTV: for me its wrath>tbc>legion>mop
[3:13:34] skymercii: @SamboneTV WoD was my pvp expac

[3:13:46] TwitchGurls: u will see when wrath comes out...the numbers will be insane
[3:13:49] ArcaneSyntax: serenade has music notes that come off it
[3:13:53] YungDizzY: legion, wrath, BC
[3:13:55] holychief26: @Sniper_Penguin Panda only made good by timeless isle
[3:14:01] nitemare34godd: What is everyone fav wow exp music.  I love bfa sound track best

[3:15:19] TwitchGurls: will the real test TOS?
[3:15:21] holychief26: @Sniper_Penguin Legion only made good by fixing a broken leggo/borrowed power system. I think legion was the start of a heavy reliance on borrowed power and then that led to Azerite necks LUL
[3:15:22] Dackor: you can get most of the mount recipes in a quick swoop of ZM

[3:27:00] fistofnature: @nvnto they were pushed out of ardenweald
[3:27:01] Jokervenom1978: Galywix sucks and im a goblin main.
[3:27:18] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I dont think so, Galyvix is one of the characters where his story is ended, like Gazlove, or Durotan in Draenor
[3:27:24] zodd_amhai: Legion is my first for sure
[3:27:33] manmower: best initial xpac experience was WoD
[3:27:34] Stevenseagullol: MoP was golden for pvp imo
[3:27:37] ZakuzaGB: legion slapped
[3:27:45] MMokuin: As a Goblin only player i wanna see Galiwix dead!
[3:27:47] avinater: MOP is criminally underrated
[3:27:51] SonJacob: mop and legion did
[3:27:51] KragnosWoW: MoP and Legion are tied for first for me i cant just narrow an expansion to being the best
[3:28:01] Saltytyphoon: died in mop
[3:28:01] net_mi: Played any BC classic?
[3:28:05] zodd_amhai: BFA???
[3:28:05] UltraKSlaya: Mop>Legion>cata>wotlk for me
[3:28:15] ILikeKillTheZombies: Legion was my most played expansion since wotlk
[3:28:16] Cryzizt: What is your favorite expansion?
[3:28:18] manmower: BFA had a confusing story, but it made more sense than SL story
[3:28:20] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: yea let's not be like BFA
[3:28:20] Maytan26: alt friendly expansion pls
[3:28:21] ipwnabs: ive a clip of u saying 10.0 its gonna be hmm. good

[3:28:34] ZakuzaGB: i think BFA is the only xpac i didnt take a break from
[3:28:35] PvtHudson093: EU wow token was up to 300k
[3:28:48] Devcomz: My top 3 worst have to be Shadowlands BFA and WoD but thats me
[3:28:49] Saltytyphoon: alot knew were done after dragons
[3:29:01] ipwnabs: so u must know something right :D
[3:29:03] vandjiii: If they keep power systems people will crap all over it lol
[3:29:22] Saltytyphoon: RL doesn't know
[3:29:24] jumpycraft: What the top runner for
[3:29:25] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @nelorixx (warning)
[3:29:48] ArcaneSyntax: lusting like all the lusty argonian maids in 10.0
[3:29:58] Grizly922: same
[3:30:05] Saltytyphoon: to do that commitment and know and trust
[3:30:06] UltraKSlaya: same, shadowlands was my only real break
[3:30:10] vandjiii: shadowlands made me quit retail
[3:30:10] ZakuzaGB: well when i say break i mean a few weeks to a month or 2 haha - but there was always something to do  it felt like
[3:30:25] zodd_amhai: the amount of systems really fucked SL
[3:30:27] darkdestroz: And then the blizz shit happend
[3:30:34] Jarlan23: i remember you saying in beta that sl could be like 50/50 on if its good or not
[3:30:35] EllisTheMenace1: shadowlands is shocking
[3:30:41] ArcaneSyntax: I think of the last 5 expansions I've played Shadowlands the most.
[3:30:46] Pallananana: IT WAS YOU ... IN THE MOUNTAINS
[3:30:48] Saltytyphoon: ya watts watts what
[3:30:54] EscapePlan01: yeh there were mitigating circumstances to SL with the blizz shit as well
[3:31:04] Saltytyphoon: rude
[3:31:06] manmower: at least SL is doing some experimentation finally
[3:31:12] Shapelessdnb: I like the bleeding powers on Fury warrior. Good flavour tbh
[3:31:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: wod was the game I raid logged the most for
[3:31:19] Shapelessdnb: in bfa
[3:31:19] ZakuzaGB: Do we have any idea what todays announcements format is going to be like?
[3:31:28] Ghamera: i like the covenants now
[3:31:29] YungDizzY: Its because its over basically
[3:31:52] LspN: i had my bets times in BC and WotLK
[3:31:57] Maytan26: expansion release is next year april or jan
[3:31:58] LspN: best*
[3:32:00] MetalManGG: Sylvanas was the first last boss I didn't get AotC on Sadge
[3:32:02] UltraKSlaya: should have pulled the ripchord, like everyone was sayin
[3:32:04] Devcomz: When do you think next expansion will release since they announced a SL Season 4 for M+ and pvp?
[3:32:05] wall_facer: every streamer was going crazy over Torghast in the beta... it was said to be the best thing since sliced bread.
[3:32:07] punkybrewstr: Do you think Blizzzard will listen to what the player base wants given this next xpac may be the straw that breaks the camels back?
[3:32:18] manmower: @ZakuzaGB hopefully a sing-a-long with all of the Blizzard staff, "We are the world"
[3:32:21] vandjiii: Wrath will be fun, just level alts, raidlog

[3:33:29] Gaddreal: We learnt from our mistakes in BFA
[3:33:30] dannelc: what up
[3:33:31] manmower: they better start off by a video of the ripcord being pulled
[3:33:31] Damingo54: You think there is going to be that much stuff to cover? Let’s hope it’s not just one short video
[3:33:33] Swillpot: do you have a prediction when it will be released?
[3:33:34] Gaddreal: oops i mean Shadowlands kek
[3:33:52] luckfore: ppl gonna be throwing their money at the screen when blizz shows mommy alexstraza
[3:34:00] 3663Sharad: 5Head
[3:34:03] KingofMeccano: is anyone else experiencing issues  on EU side? or is it just me
[3:34:10] Saltytyphoon: oh only cool clubs? um

[3:34:20] SixthZeak: 1 year? Sadge
[3:34:22] DannyPear97: "Prediction" Kappa
[3:34:35] Saltytyphoon: ya tech
[3:34:36] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: BOOBA
[3:34:39] cabalish: lets shake it baby
[3:34:46] MarquisLek: alexstraza gonna voice the expansion cinematic
[3:34:46] cappei: I've already cleared some space in my spank bank for high-res Alexstrasza pics
[3:34:55] Thoreya: we goin back to bfa pog
[3:34:59] EllisTheMenace1: a year of this shit ? fuck that noise
[3:35:00] vandjiii: Wrath end of Sept, Retail end of march would make sense
[3:35:02] mmrghost7: 14 months of 9.2 oh babe
[3:35:10] Tokies: I want to make sure they don't cover her up. I think they should bring back slut mog. I'm a woman. I don't like wearing bulky crap. I wanna look the way I wanna look in game.
[3:35:11] Saltytyphoon: ya no massives only a speaker
[3:35:13] manmower: 9.2.5 is bringing 2 new raids still
[3:35:14] ambiganti: I feel like they'd want to fast track that release
[3:35:18] SixthZeak: Go to the big rocket
[3:35:21] thorined: they did nathanos dirty in shadowlands i hope he returns LUL
[3:35:22] SonJacob: alexandra i would smash no cap
[3:35:24] Thoreya: i think jan 10.0
[3:35:28] cdk058: flight point in back
[3:35:59] luckfore: are they all back in office?
[3:36:02] SixthZeak: Flight point was where the rocket landed, right in front of you KEKW
[3:36:08] Kamenwati: announcement probably has been postponed several times now internally though
[3:36:10] 3663Sharad: True 9to5 casual move KEKW
[3:36:13] Mistery836: lol this mount fits the music so well KEKW
[3:36:15] cappei: I mean, it was supposed to be announced 2 months ago, yeah? Don't think it's crazy to cut 60 days off from the general amount of time it takes from announcement > release
[3:36:17] Maytan26: they should take as much time as they want, cant afford to mess this expansion
[3:36:22] Stevenseagullol: would also make sense to hold it for the people both playing TBC and retail, to do sunwell etc first and then go retail
[3:36:44] FoXGuian: It will launch this Fall. They need the good publicity.
[3:36:52] king_julian_96: 6hrs
[3:36:54] vandjiii: If ever, if they can work for home it might stay hybrid

[3:37:22] cappei: Or am I misremembering
[3:37:36] manmower: maybe a series of videos again like leading into BFA
[3:37:37] NimbusTV: @Maytan26 Yes they can, because we'll all keep coming back regardless
[3:37:46] MetalJoshP: Actually had trouble sleeping last night lol I love new expansion reveal day let’s go boys hammers up big day!
[3:37:46] luckfore: 9.2.5 and alpha/beta will keep us occupied
[3:37:52] vandjiii: Rather have them take 6 months extra instead of a shitfest
[3:37:52] Saltytyphoon: only a jupiter
[3:37:55] ZakuzaGB: i mean we have season 4 - and season 4 has a lot in it as well remember guys haha
[3:37:56] Mortal_Wombat_: doesnt mean its a good thing just because we are used to it

[3:43:11] manmower: Horde needs a new warchief for 10.0
[3:43:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @tokies connect your phone then

[3:44:57] LspN: deathwing yes
[3:45:01] Tokies: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight I have vision and earing issues so a phone is a waste of money for me. If you look at my screen to play wow the text is larger then most phone screens horizontal. I play on a huge screen. I do have a text phone but blizzard doesn't except those types of phones because VOIP base. Through disbality services.

[3:47:32] yanansmootlol: God remember when people were playing ff14, where are they now
[3:47:40] UndeaDKilleRcRo: @Towelliee can you please remove that kill shot speel info thanks :D
[3:47:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: OMEGALUL
[3:47:53] FreeMont: ff14 omg srsly boring as fuck

[3:48:17] yanansmootlol: ff14 is boring
[3:48:23] FreeMont: Wildstar was really good :D
[3:48:28] Fatcat_jack: @swapt1__ Ty! Also a good ranged dps not too complex?
[3:48:29] Saltytyphoon: find?
[3:48:32] ACrankyGooose: @punkybrewstr corect
[3:48:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: New World goes offline in 2023 for sure
[3:48:39] Reckless_Monk: wildstar was freaking awesome
[3:48:42] tydrennistv: How likely do you think we get a new class?
[3:48:44] Reckless_Monk: miss wildstar

[3:48:46] SixthZeak: They have none in Lost Ark KEKW
[3:48:50] swampt1l: uhhh probably BM Hunter LOL @Fatcat_jack
[3:48:52] LightBladeStream: Being able to bounce between wow retail/classic, new world, lost ark etc is nice in 2022
[3:48:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[3:48:54] Tokies: true

[3:48:59] Hiimraving: I heard oceanic new world is thriving
[3:49:08] FreeMont: ok but i want know where 10m of WoW subscribers go :D
[3:49:08] Dirtnose: People always praise Wildstar but didnt that game struggle majorly to retain any sort of playerbase? hence why its dead now
[3:49:17] yanansmootlol: @Hiimraving Can agree was on there last night
[3:49:27] rhopland: when is the reveql again?

[3:49:49] Saltytyphoon: maybe a remix
[3:50:05] Thoreya: i need some wine for the announcement today..
[3:50:06] Tokies: I wouldn't be shocked. It's got a decent cash shop that doesn't go overboard. There's no cheat ups in the cash shop.  Unlike a lot of overseas games. for that market it's probably refreshing.
[3:50:08] BrutalHermit: The only thing keeping me from playing WoW is the fact I can't play the race I want to right from the start lol
[3:50:10] FreeMont: @Towelliee u played GW2? what do you think
[3:50:18] yanansmootlol: It will come back they are making alot of Quality of life changes

[3:50:52] doomester: @Towelliee its really stuiped why blizzard restrict new ppl from getting flying mount immdiatly
[3:50:54] luckfore: KEKW
[3:50:56] Reckless_Monk: @dirtnose kinda hard to fill a 40man raid when half the population quit in the first few months. but it doesnt take away from it being a fun game. just too hardcore lol
[3:51:00] Im_a_sad_man: tmog from islands is pretty good way to get gold.
[3:51:07] FreeMont: with new xpac WoW can be played on xbox one Kappa
[3:51:08] Maytan26: what is the goal of this account
[3:51:13] RuggedRender: My main issue with Wildstar was the lack of "seriousness" in the lore tbh, wasnt realy immersive. Other then that, was a good game
[3:51:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Last time I was in Island Expeditions, leveling people rocked hard with their scaling
[3:51:26] skittleguzzler: he's pretending to be somebody's dad
[3:51:27] MrGattz: sure sure but like eventually you can like when the challenge is done
[3:51:28] Mistery836: I get you. what you could do is play something else till you unlock it and race change. But I can understand not willing to plan to spend money just to have a character look like what you want LUL
[3:51:32] cerealkillas22: WORK WORK
[3:51:33] Maytan26: what is a 9 to 5 challenge

[3:54:27] MarquisLek: DRAGON ARTIFACT HYPE !
[3:54:28] Velzenx: @yanansmootlol its not. A new player needs to download addons to be competitive. Hows that good
[3:54:28] FreeMont: Artifact weapon was really good, Legion was the last good expansion
[3:54:32] LightBladeStream: Not being able to plan my cooldowns around boss timers sounds like a bad change. IF they nuke addons
[3:54:35] ILikeKillTheZombies: what about your own crafter artifact weapon, named after your choosing
[3:54:37] fowlentv: bring heart of azeroth back It was great in 8.2
[3:54:40] Reckless_Monk: give us ASPECT weapons :)
[3:54:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was nice never having to worry about replacing your weapon, I liked that
[3:54:49] LesterLinton: is there still a chance we could all have been fooled by the dragonflight leaks and blizz drop something else today?
[3:54:54] Sphinx2k: how do I find the bingo card?

[3:59:16] Misk1976: @Towelliee Ive been playing since Vanilla WoW. I was one of their original testers here in Oz. I have never said that about any expansion. I don't understand how people keep saying that its the last they will play. They will only miss out on the fun of the game.
[3:59:16] i_cassius: WoW DF was a deflection
[3:59:18] avinater: if its not dragons i will stand and applaud blizzard for the greatest troll job in history

[3:59:29] Effin_Steffin: WoW 2: Electric Boogaloo? I'm sold.
[3:59:30] Orirholim: @KragnosWoW huh? this season is the best shadowlands has been

[4:02:18] Ghamera: damn im gonna have to sub, these 7 and 8 add things are nuts

[4:02:34] Praetour: @Sphinx2k I've grinded too many mounts to want them to remove those Kappa
[4:02:35] RageerPLZ: I find Asmongold and Bellular channels are all about the bad stuff, I mean I get it negativity and controversy sells, but it's getting very tiresome

[4:03:20] Orirholim: @Ghamera use your prime sub ontowelliee and get twitch turbo for everyone else if you watch a lot of twitch
[4:03:22] Aaradin: legendary currency isnt account bound
[4:03:29] Saltytyphoon: is that dnd?

[4:03:47] kenth0z: kenth0z subscribed with Prime. 
[4:03:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Twitch Turbo is a good deal if you watch a bunch of streamers, I love it
[4:03:53] Ghamera: Had to get rid of those 8 ad chains
[4:03:55] Aaradin: lol
[4:04:01] Sphinx2k: Retail currently is the most casual friendly ever...
[4:04:08] Misk1976: @RageerPLZ I stopped watching Asmon due to his temper tantrums and negativity. I don't understand why he is so negative about WoW.
[4:04:35] Saltytyphoon: watched ads I kickin
[4:04:40] schnfsh: trueeee LUL
[4:04:42] SphinxyOCE: hahaha
[4:04:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lost Ark was over 400,000 on Steam yesterday, it's going strong still
[4:04:44] MrGM: he's not wrong
[4:04:45] Mistery836: Think it's more because the magic for him is gone. if you get what I mean.
[4:04:48] Dirtnose: So true
[4:04:50] Modaggio: LUL
[4:04:50] TacDuc: At the end of the expansion, it's almost always casual friendly
[4:04:58] Praetour: Shadowlands was EXACTLY the same
[4:05:01] Mistery836: why is twitch responds not working for me...
[4:05:07] Dirtnose: Dude this game has 20 less people than less week, DEAD GAME
[4:05:09] KragnosWoW: well steamcharts also says lost ark stonks are dropping
[4:05:10] Aaradin: asmon is a persona its like wrestling lol, if you watch him on his other channel hes a copletely different, cant believe people havent figured that out by now
[4:05:11] Dirtnose: last*
[4:05:17] Blackminuz: you got a rocket for a quest that can make you jump out of water
[4:05:18] Aaradin: person*
[4:05:18] nvnto: I mean, you can't know about the flaws when you've never played the game until then
[4:05:23] Saltytyphoon: um have 8 fus yes
[4:05:31] Layercake: That's the model ...that's playing the tubes algorithim HahaThink
[4:05:35] balooky_: Asmon doens't even do his own YT
[4:05:36] obbi87: @Sepron14 "Gear" is not the thing, there is not enough content for casuals.  HC and Mythic raid, a casual can never go in there.
[4:05:37] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  what are you watching?
[4:05:41] Dirtnose: There's people that unironically say WoW is dead. People like that are just clowns
[4:05:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's true about negativity getting views
[4:05:53] digitoxity: this bahjeera?
[4:05:53] KragnosWoW: lost ark isnt dead but the number of players have significantly dropped
[4:05:53] Orirholim: I mean, that's clickbait 101. Eeveryone does it.
[4:05:58] sleepy_anko: Its the same every time, so annoying
[4:06:00] NimbusTV: @Towelliee
[4:06:01] cabalish: real talk while workout
[4:06:03] king_julian_96: i swear if blizz announces 10.0 and there is another shitty grind jsut to do raiding and mythic plus  iam done with retail ill just play classiv or ffxiv
[4:06:04] Malarick: he's 1000% right
[4:06:04] DovahChicken: soundsl ike Baj LUL
[4:06:07] Dirtnose: Negativity sells
[4:06:08] annokev: His is 100% right
[4:06:09] Xugodx2012: Hate the Game not the Player basically
[4:06:09] irrefutable_ire: Asmon's editors are out of control - clickbaiting like crazy the past month or two
[4:06:11] Qargory: people listen to views asmon WAYYY too much
[4:06:13] NimbusTV: @Towelliee It's their youtube guys.. all about clickbait. I hate it
[4:06:15] Two_Headed_Raven: negativity sells more than possitivity, sadly
[4:06:17] DovahChicken: @zerotize  sure sunds like him lol
[4:06:21] Saltytyphoon: only playa wtf u know purple orb
[4:06:21] booniesandbag: Asmons youtube thumbnails and titles are so bad
[4:06:25] nvnto: You play a new game, you start learning about the flaws, you talk about the flaws. Doesnt seem wrong to me.
[4:06:31] sleepy_anko: Asmons editors have been really annoying lately with their clickbait
[4:06:33] king_julian_96: not ff you don't hear ffxiv getting this heat
[4:06:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember that, yeah
[4:06:34] digitoxity: @DovahChicken lol yea
[4:06:36] pixxelina: he actually changed the title the following days
[4:06:36] Jarlan23: they got stuck on xymox
[4:06:37] Sepron14: @obbi87 LFR and Normal are casual friendly its so easy to learn the tactics and get in to groups. PVP is also casual friednly with random BGS and now soloq queue
[4:06:39] Dirtnose: Should have been titled worst raid group ever LUL
[4:06:39] luckfore: he had to change the title of that vid
[4:06:41] thorined: Asmons editor really likes clickbait titles
[4:06:42] dracullus: and then they pretend they critic WoW because they love this game so much when clearly clickbait is more important for them
[4:06:48] Tokies: couldnt kill it on normal with random pugs
[4:06:49] Mistery836: it's how youtube works LUL
[4:06:53] Polarized5: he doubled down on that when he was reacting to a bellular video about raid clearing LUL
[4:06:56] mrrazputin: Change your title to WORST wow expansion reveal :D
[4:06:58] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  What addon does you use that shows the % xp on the quests?
[4:07:02] TheodredCaelzara: @sleepy_anko Thats a bad excuse. he is the owner, he should check before.
[4:07:02] RuggedRender: so whats the second timer about?
[4:07:02] KragnosWoW: @king_julian_96 thats because FF has a niche community of die hard fans
[4:07:06] madmike_99: BFA was the worst expansion ever
[4:07:07] nz_jade: Happened big time with Torghast
[4:07:37] Ghamera: In capitalism, your first job is to make money, 2nd job is to do job
[4:07:38] stykri1: bfa was good especially 8.2 8.3
[4:07:40] Saltytyphoon: microsoft simulator moo
[4:07:41] sleepy_anko: @TheodredCaelzara yes i know, ultimately he is in control. He is letting them just operate with no oversight i think..
[4:07:51] obbi87: @Sepron14 Most people in an mmorpg is the casuals and the fact is, that wow dont have enough content for them. ALso why the sub numbers are lower
[4:07:54] Stonefather: WOW DRAGONS D:
[4:08:00] madmike_99: warfronts and islands were literally false advertising
[4:08:02] Fearmyrage_: BFA was only bad first patch
[4:08:02] Zendero89: @RuggedRender the top one is the amount streamed today
[4:08:02] luckfore: "asmongold quit lost ark" have seen this title 100x now
[4:08:04] stykri1: @madmike_99 you dont have a clue casual
[4:08:07] dreadvaine: can I get that
[4:08:07] rohdey: Kappa you did say it would be 'different' if i'm not mistaken
[4:08:10] KragnosWoW: "Not dragons? then what is it?!?"
[4:08:11] dracullus: WORST REVEAL EVER NO AUDIENCE EVEN SHOW UP
[4:08:11] digitoxity: batchest
[4:08:11] Valzark: here be dragons
[4:08:17] MMokuin: Dragons POGGERS
[4:08:17] Hesuy: “And here is why”
[4:08:18] RuggedRender: @Zendero89 ah makes sense, cheers
[4:08:22] Praetour: World of Warcraft: Pog Champ Dragons :O
[4:08:22] MrGM: "WOW SAVED"
[4:08:25] madmike_99: @Notorik123 stfu monkey
[4:08:28] Misk1976: Asmon doesn't like it when he get's caught out in live stream on some things he has used as his twitch stream heading. plus if someone gets something in a raid that he wants he claims that it was ninjad from him. I hate his negativity and tantrums!
[4:08:37] Saltytyphoon: search ty
[4:08:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Torghast had a lot of hype, I saw its potential....but then they forced us to spend hours every week in there and we didn't get much out of it

[4:08:48] hotchrisbfries: @Towelliee adding new features like islands or torghast is fine, its when they tie power gains to it that make it mandatory that ruin the fun
[4:08:53] Dirtnose: Less people are playing this game since it launched, CONFIRMED DEAD
[4:08:54] Sepron14: @obbi87 You must only do current seasonal content to believe there isnt content for eveyone.
[4:08:55] Erielle04: @MrGM Oh hi Dan
[4:08:56] TheodredCaelzara: Its the last chance for WOW...since 2004 TM

[4:09:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: With Torghast they eventually made it optional and now most of us don't bother with it, and it's not a problem anymore
[4:09:51] Scoodles91: addons are messing this up
[4:09:52] Saltytyphoon: wish
[4:09:55] Layercake: If you don't play the algorithim game..you don't grow, i don't blame the content creators that do that...the fault are the sheeples that follow them blindly

[4:13:32] Talason: aspect power
[4:13:35] king_julian_96: cause you know iam right
[4:13:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Cheerios_Esc FFXIV sold so many copies of their game that they had to stop selling it
[4:13:36] DovahChicken: i Enjoyed Legion alot.. even with the AP because literly evrrtying gave it.. so was not forced to do one thing to get it
[4:13:37] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Do you think that a mod like Heroes of the Storm can be added in the game, like Warfront, but make it as a BG maybe?
[4:13:38] madmike_99: @netariwow Hahaha you're funny
[4:13:43] LightBladeStream: @weirdo_dude Yeah, we need good content to have good rewards in an mmo

[4:14:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's hard to match player numbers but I think it's still clear that a lot of players left WoW for FFXIV and they're not really back
[4:14:57] Saltytyphoon: ty wow
[4:14:59] madmike_99: What is the point of AP though? Why is gear ilvl not enough for power? @Towelliee
[4:15:05] Armdel: and then peopel would find the fastest way to grind it and do that
[4:15:06] ZakuzaGB: AND its account wide @Towelliee  PogChamp
[4:15:09] MrGM: I guess it depends how much you get
[4:15:09] Radiag: i just really really hope they dont split the zones again, splitting 6 zones into pairs of 3 was already a bit meh imo in bfa, but then having all seperate in SL just sucks
[4:15:12] Talason: towelliee are you gunna make a house next expansion?
[4:15:13] Domini1001: @Towelliee  yea but raids are limited pr week and m+ isnt
[4:15:14] ArcaneSyntax: what if aspect power is just like cosmic flux
[4:15:15] MrGharr: AP is good as long as we don't need bag space, and infinite farm like in legion.

[4:16:22] king_julian_96: people liek you are why we can't have nice things
[4:16:27] Ilibrit: You have to use the flying mount
[4:16:28] Face_32: would you like them to bring back titanfordging? @Towelliee

[4:18:26] Saltytyphoon: ya peppermint died
[4:18:26] bazziiiTV: yeah because the whinders where loud enough to get it removed
[4:18:33] Xugodx2012: Return of Reforging inc kappa
[4:18:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reforging was great for changing stats, I liked that concept too
[4:18:36] bchris13: reforging would be great honestly, helps pad out bad gear rng
[4:18:37] UnholyLP: nah they said its just stupid to just go back reforge everytime you get a new piece and a addon is doing it for you anyway
[4:18:38] samaxis: It was more they thought it diminished loot more than they wanted
[4:18:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: cata reforging was the way

[4:28:43] Colt_Engineer: omg if they launch with lfg the asmongold bois will be pissed lol
[4:28:59] Stonefather: Launch version of DK obviously, I need to be the most OP Keepo
[4:29:00] Maytan26: ret paladin was so good in wrath
[4:29:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think how broken Death Knights were at the start kind of forces them into a later patch
[4:29:01] SpoofAvatar: nerfed 3.35 DK LUL
[4:29:09] LightBladeStream: I'm fine with turbo busted hero class DK for a month
[4:29:10] reformedalex12345: you wont level through zones
[4:29:11] Hawlk: they are gonna launch with 3.3 and id be disappointed
[4:29:11] larrylegend36: no point to be mad thi

[4:29:23] Madfwaz: lfr in classic wrath
[4:29:25] ArcaneSyntax: fuck the asmongold people give me lfg.
[4:29:27] mavericks312: I will say it now Wrath launches with LFG and LFR
[4:29:29] ILikeKillTheZombies: asmongold will get all his gear from viewers anyway
[4:29:31] larrylegend36: yes idk the arguement for no
[4:29:33] Tokies: lfg new style instead
[4:29:34] Gaxx94: the silent majority
[4:29:41] Stonefather: Dying and coming back as a ghoul was the funniest shit ever as a DK.
[4:29:42] anacronz: i cant w8 for lvl 68 boost and new mount

[4:30:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: #NOCHANGES
[4:30:14] Xugodx2012: Asmon would prob be fine with it since it was in wrath if it was on the other hand he would prob be upset
[4:30:23] SinicalDev: Obsessively bringing up other streamers in someones chat is so whack lmao grow up
[4:30:23] mavericks312: #allthechanges to wrath++
[4:30:25] unowncreature: @Towelliee If they don't have OG DK it won't be worth playing to me
[4:30:26] Maytan26: just go for alternative timeline
[4:30:27] coldhandsbeatz: 99% of the people who dont want LFG dont play classic.
[4:30:27] Dashuria: i want MoP classic
[4:30:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: It does make me hyped up to know that it doesn't have to suck
[4:30:28] aumixp: @ilikekillthezombies as it has allways been with asmon
[4:30:31] madmike_99: They'll just release Cataclysm Classic after Lich King LUL
[4:30:31] Malarick: they need to relax ot
[4:30:34] Xugodx2012: if it was in tbc*
[4:30:34] Praetour: Wrath classic will be their "lets make Wrath how we envision it these days" for sure
[4:30:36] NBK_Sethus: tbh wrath classic will be very short lived
[4:30:36] Zephyr_FH: @Towelliee Do you think it will stop at wotlk ?
[4:30:37] Typh166: Wonder if we will get wow token for wraith.  I thought for sure we would see it by now in TBC.
[4:30:41] ancksuamoon: @Towelliee what is your fav. Gfuel flavour?
[4:30:42] KontrolStyle: @GhettoKoolAid, yeah OG dk was so good
[4:30:42] PatchesMcPatch: I certainly hope blizzard make their own judgement call because the classic cry babies have nfi whats good
[4:30:45] Hawlk: wod classic Kappa
[4:30:45] Truthseeker96: @ILikeKillTheZombies dude wants pvp gear to scale to the highest ilvl for pve when all he had to do was farm bgs or arenas for easy honor to upgrade OMEGALUL
[4:30:51] Dirty_Undies: I came back to classic only for Wotlk

[4:31:38] Thoreya: i actually really enjoyed these bfa questlines
[4:31:40] josephrt10: imagine cata classic
[4:31:44] Shaele: I still laugh about the #nochanges tags that sometimes come back on my twitter feed. Ppl cried about it for so long but when the players from the pirate servers came and shat on their beloved vanilla content and did everything with like lvl50's they suddenly chanted #changes KEKW
[4:31:45] ancksuamoon: i love elv ui best ui i think
[4:31:46] Thoreya: i think i have stockholm syndrome with bfa

[4:32:24] Erielle04: @anacronz Not likely
[4:32:27] CGd0c: Soon your 2 timers will show the same

[4:32:45] madmike_99: I just want to be an adventurer again. And have new content every 3 months. Then I'm happy
[4:33:11] Colt_Engineer: they use them for the mage tower and legion timewalking
[4:33:19] Tokies: heirloom chants
[4:33:19] Maytan26: do you think wow develeopment team leak expansion stuff on purpose
[4:33:21] LightBladeStream: Yeah, I'm able to sell classic mats aswell while lvling
[4:33:33] Velirith: Legion 77 day patch cycle was amazing
[4:33:33] SlideCancelXDD: TooQuick
[4:33:43] Colt_Engineer: @madmike_99 bro if that happen with my current job I would never be able to catch up
[4:33:44] purrfecto: probably bfa enchants for mage tower
[4:33:47] Erielle04: @Velirith I agree
[4:33:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: New content, that feeling of exploration, is awesome.....that's why I like the idea of Classic+
[4:33:55] Eregbueye: every week a new location
[4:34:00] Rebemma: Think they buy these old mats because of mage tower
[4:34:00] jamarky23: I mean if its casual non raid content then 3 months is fine imo
[4:34:02] mavericks312: you will get new content every 5 months and like it lol
[4:34:10] R3CON1: better to have old content that doesnt become obsolete
[4:34:12] Velirith: why is it hard to replicate? What changed?
[4:34:13] xaeblue: im hoping WoW rips a couple pages from FF's casual content availability, like FF did with some of their classic system 󠀀
[4:34:13] Kotoma: Path of Exile tho?
[4:34:20] Tokies: i felt blizz love during legion
[4:34:22] Val3rion: so many aspects of the xpac already got leaked? poor blizzard
[4:34:27] Thoreya: we gotta wait for that microsoft acquistion to take place for faster content updates
[4:34:34] XshadowturkeyX: legion just did so many things right
[4:34:40] ArcaneSyntax: to be fair legion patch cadence may have been because of crunch
[4:34:41] madmike_99: 9.0 launch was really fun! But then there was just no content for too long ... That's my problem
[4:34:41] EmperorFredd: SMOrc Clap
[4:34:47] medanmarko: Man, imagine if they could acomplish what GGG did with PoE... new content every 4 months. Imagine a new 5 man every 3-4 months, it would be amazing.
[4:34:49] Saltytyphoon: poe stiLL///
[4:34:51] sLogOG: the worst part for legion was the AP farm which I loved doing at that moment.
[4:35:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dropping a new zone every 6 months would be an epic undertaking, a ton of work, needing a lot of people
[4:35:05] lithium364: the logo looks nice for sure
[4:35:06] Tokies: do you think they should bring back wod proving grounds?
[4:35:15] Thoreya: the dragonflight logo looks CLEAN af
[4:35:17] Thoreya: its fire
[4:35:20] Colt_Engineer: I miss 1 boss raids

[4:35:41] blascotwitch: @Colt_Engineer me too
[4:35:44] Erielle04: Logo?
[4:35:49] ILikeKillTheZombies: i just hope the dragon race leaked is not real
[4:35:50] Rygothx: I'm going to bed soon. How many hours before the announcement again?
[4:35:53] ILikeKillTheZombies: :D
[4:35:58] Colt_Engineer: @MrGM how much do YOU know? lol
[4:35:59] unowncreature: yea
[4:36:00] Saltytyphoon: only tshirts
[4:36:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: 50 sounds right for the BFA campaign, yeah
[4:36:13] thunder993: if you unlocked all kul tiran bases, thats it
[4:36:18] anacronz: damn i will work the anouncemet time ffs
[4:36:30] invisiblematter: I wonder if the mobile game will have some synergy with the main wow client
[4:36:32] Jigawatts42: @ArcaneSyntax are you saying they are going to undo everything after the defeat of Arthas in Icecrown?
[4:36:34] Antdavs24: Do you think we get 10.0 this fall
[4:36:36] Thoreya: thats so clean
[4:36:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looks cool
[4:36:43] Khooya_: i think it was 45 for the quests that take you to the other bfa continent
[4:36:43] Mandrakey: If its not Dragonflight at this point, then its the greatest bait of alltime
[4:36:48] vaironixx: I think its gonna be more green
[4:36:49] samaxis: the color pallate looks wrong
[4:36:50] xaeblue: Just tell me the dragon character design is fake and we're all good
[4:36:50] SinicalDev: Towelliee pretending he doesnt know Kappa
[4:36:52] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee remember when pandas were predicted on reddit and everyong laughed lol
[4:36:57] Akermay: Breaks away from typical design having title without background underneath
[4:36:59] AveragePvp: Very clean
[4:37:07] KragnosWoW: Its not ugly but i wouldnt go as far to say its clean
[4:37:08] Thoreya: its like the same
[4:37:10] Velirith: oh shit
[4:37:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: its real
[4:37:16] Orion280: oh what
[4:37:17] thunder993: I swear if blizz Jebaited entire community for this long with fake leaks it would be greatest prank of all time LUL
[4:37:21] 3663Sharad: The stars allign NODDERS
[4:37:26] Snirs: rigged
[4:37:30] Velirith: whats interesting is the azeroth has no islands
[4:37:37] xaeblue: oh shit thats exact 󠀀
[4:37:37] KragnosWoW: its like a tribal tattoo lmao
[4:37:40] benkynoo: @Antdavs24 I highly doubt that, because there is going to be season 4 shadowlands, so id say new exp coming around february/march probably
[4:37:42] Val3rion: do you think the staff is sad/mad about the leaks?
[4:37:43] xaeblue: oh wait, almost
[4:37:43] Saltytyphoon: were asiam
[4:37:57] coldhandsbeatz: I mean was there any reason at this point to no think that Dragonflight was the expansion? It was a given
[4:37:59] Velirith: azeroth empty in the logo
[4:38:00] xaeblue: no thats exact 100% 󠀀
[4:38:01] MrGM: you see the Wrath logo?
[4:38:03] Thoreya: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...
[4:38:05] jure__: bare in mind, these logos can go through versions, just like when shadowlands leaked, it looked different to release
[4:38:05] the_general01: flatsBelieve
[4:38:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towelliee knows
[4:38:13] Youredoneson666: wouldn't the abbreviation be WoD again?
[4:38:17] fbirobertmueller805: All I see are boobies
[4:38:17] LAUCHS_mit_BAUCHS: @Towelliee ur timer not right ? it is 5 hours 30 is it not ?
[4:38:26] madmike_99: I wonder who these people are that leak stuff on mmochampion
[4:38:27] AveragePvp: @val3rion honestly I think they like it as long as too much isn’t leaked, look how hype everyone is and how much were talking period
[4:38:28] Antdavs24: @benkynoo makes sense
[4:38:31] skeletorsyourdad: it would be hilarious if everyone was wrong about the expansion
[4:38:32] Saltytyphoon: damn u cheers
[4:38:42] lithium364: reminds me of some primal viking land with the logo
[4:38:46] invisiblematter: Do you think dragonflight has a double meaning?

[4:38:51] EllisTheMenace1: towel already knows must be so hard not saying haha
[4:38:57] Lupusdeus: i'm happy with the visuals i've seen other than that abomination of a playable green drakonid somebody shared like that, eff that shit. @Towelliee
[4:38:58] Velirith: maybe the other side of azeroth
[4:38:58] Stonefather: Icecrown melted, it's an underwater expansion now

[4:39:11] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: just spill the beans towelliee
[4:39:11] Shaele: tbh, this whole hd logo could just be made from that image as a reference. Everything could be just a great hoax
[4:39:11] skittleguzzler: blue = water. Underwater expansion confirmed EZ
[4:39:11] Tausgi: that is so fake. Real expansion is World Of Warcraft: Revenge of Murlocs
[4:39:19] Velirith: funny enough the leak hype for this expansion is the highest its ever been in my opinion
[4:39:21] Nowaayjose: dragon race looks ugly af

[4:39:43] Poppsalt: we go back in time, there is only dragon isles. storyline is about creating kalimdor and eastern kingdoms
[4:39:44] bazziiiTV: imagine the announcement won't have a single dragon in it. the disappointment :D
[4:39:45] Finsby_: I love shit like this FeelsGoodMan
[4:39:46] AveragePvp: So if there is a dragon race, the new pandas?
[4:39:46] ole_veteran_grit: ole_veteran_grit subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:39:49] Stonefather: It's pretty crappy looking, thus it's probably real.
[4:39:53] deadalon: Players beeing able to take on dragon from would be awsome
[4:39:53] lithium364: the male ones might look badass with the male dreadlord rig
[4:39:53] Velirith: this leak season has been very spicy
[4:40:00] Finsby_: I am living my best life today FeelsGoodMan

[4:40:41] Velirith: @Towelliee do you think the talent tree leaks are real?
[4:40:41] Stonefather: I'm tell you Towelliee, it's actually a Scourge expansion.
[4:40:43] Face_32: blizz needs to start doing false leaks
[4:40:44] Ziddrax: just to crate hype
[4:40:47] LAUCHS_mit_BAUCHS: ah
[4:40:49] LAUCHS_mit_BAUCHS: ty
[4:40:50] pacificmc1: the new dragon race looks weird, have you seen it towellie
[4:40:50] skittleguzzler: leaks build hype
[4:40:51] Clicklesly: People have also been posting 'totally legit' Dragon Isles leaks for the past year though :-I

[4:40:59] xaeblue: i would honestly welcome a complete 180 from the leaks 󠀀
[4:41:02] Thoreya: i think dragonflight is a fire name too
[4:41:03] madmike_99: Time skip 1000 years please :D
[4:41:04] Thoreya: nice nd simple
[4:41:06] Sprowa: I think it's dragon this exp and Elemental lords next one

[4:42:55] Draziel88: the think is when they gonna release the game
[4:42:55] GlasvollDreck: well they sure like to disappoint
[4:43:02] balooky_: I heard someone say somehting about a crossover with starcraft that would be amazing imo
[4:43:03] Stonefather: To be fair, the dragons have a pretty serious problem that needs to be solved sooner rather than later.
[4:43:05] Tokies: we talk about classic andy but retail ken just as bad
[4:43:07] GrailNite: I wonder what sculpture they will use for this expansion? Like Jaina Proudmoore and Illadin
[4:43:07] Saltytyphoon: ya the human fav
[4:43:09] Pallananana: Maybe it was a silly joke that got out of hand ... and now they're like 'fuck' KEKW
[4:43:11] KragnosWoW: what would the abbreviation be? DF or D?
[4:43:17] SocioPET: Mists of Hogwarts
[4:43:18] unowncreature: Yea but people wanting it to be Dragonflight doesn't make it blizzards fault
[4:43:21] jamarky23: Wouldnt it just show that they are in control and know what they are doing as developers. and their vision is clear?
[4:43:23] Ghamera: Misleading your customer base is a bad thing
[4:43:23] xxlegitghostxx: thts blizz for you

[4:44:09] Finsby_: DF for sure
[4:44:13] rohdey: wait, is cmon bruh disabled? :(
[4:44:18] Stonefather: What's going to be funny Dragonisles will just be a small zone in 10.3 Keepo
[4:44:20] jak_gaming: with how WoW evolved vanilla was ally vs horde like BFA/ TBC demons and Illidan like Legion/ Wrath was undead and Lich King like Shadowlands/ Cata dragons new expac might be dragon based
[4:44:24] Velirith: do you think the talent tree leaks are real?
[4:44:28] thunder993: legion was a short word though
[4:44:35] xaeblue: @coldhandsbeatz WoW L doesn't sound too good LUL 󠀀

[4:45:22] Saltytyphoon: oh won war moon kiss human as
[4:45:27] Poiuykk66: I also feel these new raid affix coming is going to be a real game changer. Finally it will be like older times going back to get a certain trinket or armour piece that’s still good!
[4:45:29] bazziiiTV: yeah imagine dragonflight being the mobile game xD
[4:45:29] SocioPET: I predict Master Chief will becoma a playable race and beyonce will be singing Halo at the release show
[4:45:29] Poiuykk66: Okay y
[4:45:30] romoleus: What's your mythic progression?

[4:45:58] Razzin_: it would be funny tho
[4:45:58] larrylegend36: it should be wow: dragon tales
[4:46:00] EllisTheMenace1: ofc he knows
[4:46:03] AveragePvp: And I know he knows
[4:46:05] tragx: The code leak with the different editions rules out WoW Mobile being called Dragonflight
[4:46:06] Finsby_: Guild halls would actually be sick. Making guilds super relevant and social again @Val3rion
[4:46:10] LightBladeStream: I have a phone :)
[4:46:10] xaeblue: true 󠀀
[4:46:11] enigmasvea: the logo needs more color
[4:46:12] Juniorc954: World first Lich King kill?

[4:46:23] Velirith: if the wow mobile game is good, ill buy a tablet just for that lol
[4:46:25] Colt_Engineer: OUR LORD AND SAVIOR PHIL SPENCER

[4:46:31] swordart2022: I got thank you from blizz ffor reporting Pog
[4:46:32] Saltytyphoon: teach your mom boarding passes
[4:46:33] NiteLancer: maybe Hello Kitties Island Adventures so we can get more cat mounts
[4:46:44] Ijee: I just want them to actually try to change the game instead of doing the same thing with a different skin
[4:46:48] byrdeen45: all i care about is a reason to come back shadowlands was just so bad
[4:46:48] Molehj: Play WoW Mobile on Bluestacks KEKW
[4:46:50] Val3rion: @Finsby_ Oh yeah! With factions restriction loosening this would be a huge win
[4:46:58] pacificmc1: @Towelliee So you said 10.0 would be very different and huge I think? Will you tell us what you knew, after the show is over :D
[4:47:05] xaeblue: @Molehj This is the way 󠀀
[4:47:06] Razzin_: @Velirith if wow mobile game is good, I will emulate it on my PC
[4:47:07] Velirith: intentional 100%
[4:47:10] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[4:47:15] MarquisLek: sometimes we dumb
[4:47:18] Saltytyphoon: fuck your connect......
[4:47:21] Velirith: @Velirith good point actually haha
[4:47:23] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee Starcraft Code was lost on a CD
[4:47:24] viz_wiz: Imagine it doesn't have anything to do with dragons
[4:47:28] skymercii: THIS WAS NOT MY INTENTION Kappa
[4:47:30] SocioPET: Remember how Hagrid had a dragon egg? Its no coincidence
[4:47:31] Stonefather: Well when you have an intern do it Towelliee Keepo
[4:47:37] thunder993: oops Kappa
[4:47:41] SocioPET: Harry Potter comes to WoW
[4:47:43] Saltytyphoon: gold atom cpu
[4:47:44] MrKryto: @Velirith if its good ill play it on my ps vita
[4:47:55] invisiblematter: It’s so odd because web dev deployment usually removes comments
[4:47:56] Ghamera: Leaks generate hype
[4:47:58] Ghamera: free PR
[4:47:58] Saltytyphoon: shielded
[4:47:59] Velirith: doesnt make sense, minifying code is automated, you dont miss a single file like that
[4:48:01] Radiag: its free advertising
[4:48:02] MrGM: guerilla marketing 101
[4:48:03] MarquisLek: somebody was like "damn thats good"
[4:48:04] Zathras11: rise of the tauren it will be i hope
[4:48:06] tetrahydridodinitrogen: Do you think a lot of problems Azeroth faces could be solved if we just decided to kill the world soul?
[4:48:15] net_mi: TBH, it's would be pretty easy for Blizz to faKe a leak, would only take a technical guy 2 days to code
[4:48:30] tragx: These comments are usually removed by an automated tool in a build chain. I can see the configuration being screwed up.
[4:48:33] Stonefather: Well that's because we just want to go home at this point.
[4:48:33] SocioPET: Alliance and Horde will become one faction and rebuild Hogwarts and after they're done the dragon from Hagrids egg will attack
[4:48:33] Velirith: @Velirith ill play it on DS
[4:48:41] falldrgn: Imean.. thers no way that was not intentional, imean there is only so much they can do "hide it"  they know we are going to look at this  stuff
[4:48:44] RuggedRender: theres certainly a trend going with dragons
[4:48:46] Molehj: World of Warcraft : Bad Dragons
[4:48:54] invisiblematter: If they use web pack I understand it that thing is horrible
[4:48:54] SinicalDev: the leaks like last october mentioned there was two options, dragons or more cosmic shit
[4:48:59] Pr1m0x21: dont youu like phones?
[4:49:00] Saltytyphoon: blizzard been umbrella'd
[4:49:01] Ijee: when in doubt get the dragons out
[4:49:07] Orgabism: "Don't you guys like dragons?"
[4:49:09] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @sociopet towStop towIt
[4:49:11] KragnosWoW: oh look a piece of candy
[4:49:13] Tryhardion: if its really dragons, I hope we get a new dragon skeleton, not just new model on the old rig
[4:49:15] thunder993: would you hypothetically enjoy an expansion called Dragonblight Kappa
[4:49:17] Armdel: i mean, by the time that leaked its about 8 months too late to make changes to the game anyway
[4:49:18] t_train_va: t_train_va subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Don't get to tune in as much as I'd like, but appreciate you and chat. Keep doing you man
[4:49:26] Gaxx94: every fake expansion leak is done by a warcraft dev as market research
[4:49:28] EmperorFredd: Dragons anyone? modCheck dragons
[4:49:32] Saltytyphoon: so still independendent?
[4:49:35] Poiuykk66: It’s gonna be a really good expansion. They’re moving in the right direction with the changes they’ve made recently so here’s hoping
[4:49:42] Jokervenom1978: Do you like movies about gladiators?
[4:49:45] Cacos: 100% intentional, there's no way they don't have code review setups and that went through unphased
[4:49:53] Ijee: @Poiuykk66 that's a lot of hopium though
[4:49:55] Velirith: what do you think about the talent trees that have been leaked?
[4:49:59] LightBladeStream: Can't wait to kill Onyxia for the 10th time on my phone POGGERS
[4:50:06] Phae__: As long as the inevitable fighting against other dragons is more exciting than the DW fights in Dragon Soul... God those were bad
[4:50:08] Stonefather: So after Dragonflight we're getting a Panda expansion right? Keepo
[4:50:14] YungDizzY: where u at blizzcon during the whoel diablo immortal thing?
[4:50:15] Zettabyte: We need more furry playable races in WoW UwU
[4:50:17] Molehj: @LightBladeStream While sat on the toilet
[4:50:17] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Gladiator the movie FeelsStrongMan
[4:50:19] MrKryto: WoW: the revival of GoT
[4:50:22] skymercii: can u link said talent tree?
[4:50:23] invisiblematter: I hope they add more dragon skeletons for models and drakes and not just reuse old ones
[4:50:26] thunder993: Onyxia 4.0 incoming
[4:50:28] KragnosWoW: @Zettabyte stop it
[4:50:29] Saltytyphoon: expensive servife atm
[4:50:29] swampt1l: Nah Jailer 2 bro Kappa @stonefather
[4:50:30] EpicJune: You can now defeat the threats of Azertoth while on the go
[4:50:32] akia03: where are the talent tree leak?
[4:50:34] Meliea_EU: big tree!
[4:50:34] Ramdorpser: talent trees are just combining all those systems they've made. Consolidate em all into 1.
[4:50:38] xaeblue: terrible and hot take: I miss the generalist classic trees 󠀀 󠀀
[4:50:42] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee can you show the talent tree on stream?
[4:50:44] swordart2022: NOt really not eveyrone is meta slave :P
[4:50:44] Stonefather: @SwapT1__ burkePain
[4:50:47] Ijee: poe likes to disagree
[4:50:48] Orgabism: They want to compete with PoE, with that talent tree? :)
[4:50:52] LightBladeStream: It's just a different version of soulbinds right?
[4:50:54] YungDizzY: OH SHIT I JUST GOT 12-B!!!
[4:50:54] Baylix: There will always be a meta
[4:50:55] Akermay: Will it just be a short cinematic and trailer stream, or longer panel explaining stuff?
[4:51:00] MetaalMeneer: can you show it?
[4:51:01] Saltytyphoon: love your taxes
[4:51:01] Phae__: The ILLLLLUSION of choice
[4:51:02] jamarky23: Yeah but we dont know the full extend of those talent trees yet
[4:51:03] Orion280: i hope they do it well and you have to change stuff for situations aoe/singletarget/cleave etc
[4:51:05] Velirith: well depends because some of the icons are past artifact weapon / covenant abilities
[4:51:08] Madfrak: Madfrak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:51:08] Lazyvigs: lazyvigs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:51:10] swampt1l: @stonefather it be like that sometimes

[4:51:10] Kisswani: @YungDizzY POGGERS
[4:51:11] xaeblue: i love illusions POOGERS
[4:51:16] Reckless_Monk: more windows to go through
[4:51:16] gvandaly: do you think it wold be fun to add cosmetic talent tree?
[4:51:20] Kotoma: I'm fine with the illusion of choice. If I feel like trying something else I will.
[4:51:24] Ijee: I swear people don't want to have any change in this game
[4:51:27] GothmaN: an illusion ?
[4:51:28] tino49: thats not true actually, in TBC talent tree are so interesting, you can adapt your build based on your gear, roster, gameplay preferences
[4:51:29] Saltytyphoon: alive typing dnb
[4:51:31] akia03: @Towelliee  where can we see this talent tree leak?
[4:51:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: An illusion? What are you hiding
[4:51:42] Dirtnose: @akia03 wow subreddit
[4:51:46] Phae__: Im actually all for old style talent trees.
[4:51:48] PixelSalad_99: my first time seeing any wow content, where’s the health bar?
[4:51:48] invisiblematter: I will sim everything as usual I can’t stand the idea of a suboptimal choice
[4:51:50] YungDizzY: @Kisswani its a sign!!
[4:51:51] Tryhardion: even with current talent tree has some choices that depend on what you would like. Perhaps if it had more of those choices.
[4:51:54] Xanogames: Xanogames subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 78 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:51:54] Frantixx: Im kinda more curious about what Mike tweeted about "the future of WoW" and more about that in may.
[4:51:55] tino49: the talent trees only problem is you cant switch them easily
[4:52:03] Stonefather: Don't ruin my dreams Towelliee.
[4:52:05] Phae__: Tired of having to manage personal tree, pvp tree, soulbind tree, etc.
[4:52:09] Velirith: A lot of the abilties in there were old borrowed power stuff. There is a reset talents button on the UI, if the trees are decently balanced the idea should be that you can switch between fights for some abilities
[4:52:11] Maawulo: did u see the talent system leak?
[4:52:14] FranciscoTheMage: i took a nap.. announcement out yt? what is it? dragons?
[4:52:16] Saltytyphoon: well big saw
[4:52:19] SinicalDev: might as well have it all in one place rather than across 2-3 systems though
[4:52:20] Kisswani: @PixelSalad_99 middle screen , green bar . it's customizedf to look that way
[4:52:21] swampt1l: Everyone is gonna run the same talents KEKW
[4:52:21] thunder993: new talent tree is basically soulbind+talent tree+conduits

[4:52:31] viz_wiz: Imagine the new xpac isn't dragonflight
[4:52:34] Ijee: if there is onyl one choice that is optimal it's just bad design with the abilities offered not with the way you choose it
[4:52:38] mavericks312: cookie cutter builds are still gonna happen, bringing back the old tree isn't gonna change that
[4:52:39] Ryukotsu: I mean I wouldnt be apposed to going into more caverns of time dungeons to collect "Aspects Power" from the past to re-power the aspects lost power Kappa
[4:52:41] Cafe0le: disagree at least in pvp there are different builds for many classes
[4:52:43] SpoofAvatar: it looks like choice
[4:52:45] BlueBeast33: There was some differentiation at least between pve and pvp with the old tree
[4:52:57] GlasvollDreck: all i want is it to be in 1 place. So annoying to change stuff in 3 places and 2 forges just to respecc
[4:52:58] Akermay: People get hung up on new and old. What does it matter if it makes ya feel good
[4:53:09] Poiuykk66: Gotta say it was between this mount and the fur line and damn right I chose the fur line to buy LUL
[4:53:09] Velirith: so what do you think will be the new level cap?
[4:53:10] aribellae: Would be nice if they brought back reforging
[4:53:19] AveragePvp: @viz_wiz my guy that’s  the 6th time you’ve said that haha
[4:53:20] LightBladeStream: As a fire mage I can only really change 1 talent anyways, so why not old talents
[4:53:22] SuperLost89: i think casual players will like the leaked talent tree. gives them more freedom if they aren't hardcore
[4:53:24] invisiblematter: I hope the reveal goes well Blizzard are long due a W
[4:53:32] Moskeebee: ha there ever been a WoW expac that wasn't leaked?
[4:53:36] scrotan: scrotan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[4:53:43] stabzmcgeee: i really dont care what the talent tree looks like,, im still gonna go on wowhead and look up the build for whatever im playing at the time
[4:53:51] Maytan26: they should just release the new talents earlier so people can test it  before the expansion
[4:53:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY

[4:53:57] Rethen2301: how long till reveal?
[4:54:06] Phae__: I mean, soulbind trees already take up a ton of screen real estate
[4:54:11] Ghamera: prepatch
[4:54:11] Velirith: so what do you think they will do with the new level cap?
[4:54:14] LightBladeStream: beta KEKW
[4:54:14] skeletorsyourdad: i hope the talent tree goes back to what it used be like
[4:54:22] Cafe0le: i rather have a huge talent tree like poe than 5 different mini systems that make it look like a mobile game ui
[4:54:23] Byytet: Give me that twilights hammer raid with cho'gall again
[4:54:26] AveragePvp: @rohdey GL
[4:54:26] maalow: alpha/beta are there for it
[4:54:26] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: yes
[4:54:28] Colt_Engineer: copium
[4:54:31] KragnosWoW: they had it done last year Kappa
[4:54:32] thunder993: @towelliee how much do you think they will reveal? just 2 trailers or?
[4:54:36] mavericks312: let's be honest as a mage I'm still gonna look up firedups build and copy that shit, now new tree is gonna change that
[4:54:37] king_waltzy: they do thats why there is a new season
[4:54:38] Phae__: Just like fortnite, SHADOWLANDS IS FOREVVVER
[4:54:38] Velirith: so what do you think they will do with the new level cap??
[4:54:42] blascotwitch: @Byytet best raid lol
[4:54:43] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: alpha today
[4:54:43] Senthius09: nah even better, new talent trees go live today, lets go
[4:54:45] xaeblue: "We heard the players, and we think we've done a fantastic job in bringing back the exact same talents we had before cata" Kappa
[4:54:47] ergolucky: towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype towHype
[4:54:49] SinicalDev: Show your F&F launcher Kappa
[4:55:00] ksnESPY: thoughts on release date?
[4:55:05] SinicalDev: might as well have it all in one place rather than across 2-3 systems though
[4:55:07] 91Niki: Good morning Towelliee and chat towHi
[4:55:16] skeletorsyourdad: @xaeblue lets hope so
[4:55:24] swordart2022: Dragon girls CONFIRMED Kreygasm

[4:55:36] Velirith: noooo :( 2022 release please
[4:55:36] Jokervenom1978: Enhance your calm, Sir.
[4:55:37] invisiblematter: I REALLY hope I get to keep abomination limb
[4:55:40] mavericks312: new talent tree would be a prepatch thing not a right now thing lol
[4:55:40] jure__: @91Niki o/
[4:55:41] ksnESPY: makes sense
[4:55:45] skeletorsyourdad: im guessing its a 2023 release
[4:55:45] Silverwards: i was hoping for the next new class to be Tinker. Goblin/Gnome mech suits and stuff? I'd reroll even if it's bad
[4:55:45] Maytan26: will they announce the release today or just give an estimate
[4:55:46] Tchadnis: i say somewhere in nov or dec
[4:55:52] Phae__: Today's announcement: Daddy Gates sold WoW, and it's being dissolved. SL is the end of the world, of warcraft
[4:55:54] Ramdorpser: That is a lot of shadowlands to deal with then :/
[4:55:54] Orirholim: @Velirith if i had to guess, shadowlands replaces bfa for the leveling up to level 50 and 50-60 is new expansion
[4:55:58] bierarnoo: 1 more year in ZM 4Head
[4:56:06] Tomlunner: hope that convoke will be a talent/baseline for druids, would be super nice
[4:56:07] Eithos87: I so want to keep grabby hands
[4:56:10] Stonefather: I like abom limb but I'm grown attached to Fleshcraft shield too
[4:56:12] AveragePvp: Wow could easily introduce a bard into the game too
[4:56:12] tetrahydridodinitrogen: Divine tolls just feels so good as a prot its insane 󠀀
[4:56:14] Poiuykk66: What content are they going to give retail until then? God it always seems so long
[4:56:15] its_andyd: Another year of shadowlands? copium
[4:56:16] krayaal: something like 4/23/23
[4:56:17] Velirith: @Orirholim yeah i think the same, makes sense for the long term
[4:56:19] Ijee: @Phae__ finally people can stop complaining about game changes
[4:56:20] raye_gaming22: if the one leaker is right (the one who leaked alot of shitand was right ) it its november 2022
[4:56:22] Orirholim: @Velirith or they revert the whole newbies having to do BFA thing and let them do what they want to 50
[4:56:25] stabzmcgeee: lore wise its a bit dumb if we just forget how to use these abilties
[4:56:26] KragnosWoW: did everyone have access to TBC alpha and beta?
[4:56:26] Praetour: 9.2.5 raid changes look good so I wouldn't mind another year
[4:56:29] Stonefather: I've*
[4:56:31] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[4:56:31] Kisswani: EU token price up to 286k , wonder what it'll be by the end of the day
[4:56:33] swampt1l: Just ask panda for keys
[4:56:35] YungDizzY: LOL
[4:56:37] swampt1l: BFA keys too
[4:56:39] sm0keo: on that "new talent tree" leak you can see convoke , so maybe all classes can spec into it
[4:56:42] xHILDAx: ahaha yeah he'll love that :p
[4:56:45] Nowaayjose: leave ryan alone
[4:56:45] Clicklesly: I mean, there's no real reason to do ZM anymore after you hit exalted?
[4:56:45] LorienV: @towelliee you going back Dwarf is 9.2.5?
[4:56:46] Jokervenom1978: LOL He HATES that
[4:56:47] lithium364: lmao
[4:56:51] Phae__: @Phae__ It would never stop. Then they'd just complain that it hasn't changed.
[4:56:52] SocioPET: @Phae__ That would actually be nice also
[4:56:54] Saltytyphoon: flavor note cook oh warning do not press play after
[4:56:56] tommypistoll: sup
[4:57:02] YungDizzY: I think Chinglish gave them to Panda.
[4:57:03] Velirith: @Orirholim hmm yeah if the chromie UI is easier to find.
[4:57:07] Colt_Engineer: November KEKW
[4:57:10] KragnosWoW: season 4 will be like july
[4:57:11] enigmasvea: wotlk is november/december
[4:57:12] CurlyFriass: OMEGALUL
[4:57:12] swampt1l: 2023
[4:57:13] Nejba: i'd say april/may 2023
[4:57:14] Cafe0le: 📸
[4:57:15] rohdey: who said January? Kappa
[4:57:15] bchris13: november 2023
[4:57:17] XshadowturkeyX: nov 2022 is prob wotlk
[4:57:17] blascotwitch: probalby may 2022
[4:57:18] Ijee: is there going to be any playerbase left if they release it sometime in 2023?
[4:57:18] Stonefather: Keep telling yourself that Towelliee, we're getting the fuck out of Shadowlands ASAP
[4:57:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: With an announced season 4, it pushes it way back
[4:57:21] mavericks312: January at the earliest and even that is unlikely
[4:57:21] Silverwards: November release means alpha is like tomorrow
[4:57:23] Phae__: There's 0 chance it's November. S3 would be incredibly short, and S4 would be like 3 months
[4:57:24] Maytan26: neversay never
[4:57:24] Ijee: I doubt it
[4:57:26] xaeblue: I wouldn't be surprised if they want this one over ASAP OMEGALUL 󠀀 󠀀
[4:57:26] Silverwards: wtf bro
[4:57:27] jamarky23: Make sense tbh, they cut this expansions short by 1-2 raids
[4:57:27] samaxis: Im fine with it Kappa
[4:57:29] Velirith: Dec 2022
[4:57:34] Stonefather: danCopium
[4:57:35] Ryukotsu: What do you think about blizzard trying to do something like Mythic+ WoTLK dungeons @Towelliee id be 100% game for that
[4:57:36] Dongtanian: feb would be ideal. just after football season when i need something to do
[4:57:38] Kakotan2143: I say that the Expack will be out 02-23-2023 @Towelliee
[4:57:38] Sicknessqt: He said wotlk classic is september KEKW
[4:57:38] raye_gaming22: like i said that wsas the guy who leaked legion not me
[4:57:41] XshadowturkeyX: he prob ment wotlk in nov  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:57:45] Eithos87: I dont see wrath classic till fall 2023
[4:57:45] Baylix: Why not though, one of them was the shortest. WotLK Sep, DF Nov
[4:57:45] Armdel: if its november we better get season 4 in the next few weeks, and you know that aint happening
[4:57:46] Stonefather: Season 4 can suck it
[4:57:49] Phae__: I would love for them to take as much time as they need. Do this shit RIGHT.
[4:57:50] swordart2022: Weirdos there is no expansion this year no idea why you even think that.
[4:57:54] FallenxGabe: he said wrath september
[4:57:54] Saltytyphoon: lol
[4:57:57] swordart2022: @Stonefather then dont play 4Head
[4:57:58] KragnosWoW: May 16th, 2023
[4:58:01] jamarky23: But they cut this expansion short by 1-2 raids and maybe a zone
[4:58:03] mmrghost7: i want it in summer
[4:58:05] Fundy31: Wrath will be November
[4:58:09] Saltytyphoon: no paladins...
[4:58:10] Stonefather: I'm thinking Late August mid Sept for Wrath Classic.
[4:58:11] Phae__: Shit I'd play LK Classic waiting for 10.0
[4:58:11] xaeblue: yeah wrath is gonna take up the time until then. Perfect segue to the new xpac
[4:58:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath in October would be sweet
[4:58:21] Pikealot: Hope Pathfinder is trashed forever just buy flying max level
[4:58:22] paravak: They skipped a whole tier in shadowlands to work on 10.0
[4:58:26] Ijee: yeah well, they could release season 4 in like 3 months. patches shouldn't be a year inbetween
[4:58:29] Velirith: do you think they will do Cata classic?
[4:58:30] Baylix: I thin they been working on 10.0 way longer than we think
[4:58:39] madmike_99: But why would I play a worse version of Retail
[4:58:40] mavericks312: wrath is the goat for a reason
[4:58:46] AureliusXV: still wont play that classic bullshit
[4:58:55] Maytan26: wrath had the most subscribers so it will be the most popular
[4:58:57] bchris13: curious if wrath will be more popular than tbc
[4:58:57] Armdel: wrath was when i got really into the game, before that i was pretty much just someone who spammed battlegrounds all day
[4:58:58] Roccocco: Nah. Lk gonna die sam as tbc
[4:59:00] skymercii: @Towelliee IF MoP classic became a thing, would you play it?
[4:59:01] swordart2022: @AureliusXV then dont EZ
[4:59:10] AureliusXV: i wont
[4:59:12] fkinthiccbro: is wow fixed? :O
[4:59:13] paravak: They cut shadowlands short to focus on getting 10.0 out at the time it normally would be (end of this year) I think
[4:59:15] Senthius09: just give me my wrath  prot warrior that can kill rogues by literally just letting them hit me
[4:59:16] Sikkbass: Thought you were gonna say you can spam HEROIC STRIKE
[4:59:16] TigeradamV: When does the cinematic come out?
[4:59:17] AureliusXV: and you canty make me
[4:59:20] Saltytyphoon: holywood tech
[4:59:22] Velirith: do you think they will do Cata classic?
[4:59:26] Stonefather: It would be a blessing if we skipped Cata.
[4:59:27] Armdel: i wonder why Kappa
[4:59:29] tino49: but they are still gonna complaint about everything being too easy et quests taking too much time ResidentSleeper
[4:59:29] gooni_coyg: if all start from lvl 1 sure
[4:59:32] TheodredCaelzara: @Towelliee i think 10.0 Q1 2023....but i would be not surprised if they force 11.0 (10th XP) for Nov 24...20 years WOW
[4:59:33] Mazkon: Cata never happened 󠀀
[4:59:34] XshadowturkeyX: yes forget cata
[4:59:35] AureliusXV: alralready played them
[4:59:36] mavericks312: cata > mop
[4:59:37] KragnosWoW: i only want cata classic since i never played it
[4:59:38] thunder993: no interest in playing any old expansions at all, already played so 0 interest
[4:59:40] Poiuykk66: Cataclysm was awesome
[4:59:43] xaeblue: I'll finally be able to kill LK without my dad carrying me like when I was a kid lol 󠀀 󠀀
[4:59:46] Rooseweld: Catra ruined everything
[4:59:46] Lazugo: I want a legion classic
[4:59:46] unowncreature: I liked cata :(
[4:59:47] fkinthiccbro: nooo, wotlk then just go a different path
[4:59:48] primej_24: How do you update your plater profiles i went into wa companion and it says i have 2
[4:59:48] mmrghost7: and then legion classic
[4:59:49] gooni_coyg: legion classic
[4:59:49] slamueljaksn: @Towelliee heya, u think they will ever allow cross faction guilds? coz i wana play horde but all my friends are alliance :)
[4:59:50] centralqt: Wotlk classic is gonna be huge for the social community rather than tbc raid logging.
[4:59:50] Stonefather: Because DKs are cool.
[4:59:51] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @pacificmc1 (warning)
[4:59:53] marinkonk: I wish we have mop classic
[4:59:53] xxlegitghostxx: wrath is the last classic
[4:59:54] raye_gaming22: catac was bad just raids were good until DS
[4:59:54] Saltytyphoon: um were standing on why and how
[4:59:54] Ramdorpser: wrath is the last, it completes the triology.
[4:59:56] Orgabism: BFA Classic? :P
[4:59:57] Armdel: i would have loved to try the cata raids aside from dragon soul
[4:59:58] LightBladeStream: Wrath Season of Mastery will be the last one
[4:59:58] billzulgurub: ripge bfa classic
[4:59:58] Velirith: so whats next after Wotlk then?
[4:59:59] GrailNite: Cata who?
[4:59:59] Maytan26: alternative timeline let go
[5:00:00] AureliusXV: it will be big for a day or two then drop off like all the others
[5:00:01] skymercii: WoD Classic INC Kappa
[5:00:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could make money doing all the expansions in Classic, though
[5:00:04] Nazkol: cant wait for SoM TBC Kappa
[5:00:05] XshadowturkeyX: wrath was the end of the rts games ofc its gonna be the last classic 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[5:00:06] tino49: what
[5:00:06] tetrahydridodinitrogen: cant wait for BFA Classic :) 󠀀
[5:00:08] thungdil: legion classic please!
[5:00:09] GlasvollDreck: and here i am loving cata. rip
[5:00:09] Dirty_Undies: Wrath to Cata was just a huge jump. How can you go from 34k to 500k+ LUL
[5:00:14] Velirith: Classic+ after?
[5:00:15] Bacanu34: give me legion classic i will play the fuck out of it
[5:00:16] thegillthrill: WoD classic would be great, go back to making fat bank and kill the economy again
[5:00:17] h_u_r_k_: wrath will have mini expansions inside it? adding to the lore? 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[5:00:17] TwitchGurls: u cant dispute that player numbers determine the best expansion
[5:00:17] tino49: dont tell me they are gonna add new content to wrath ?
[5:00:20] Finsby_: Will we be able to tank as Frost DKs in Wrath Classic? POGGERS
[5:00:20] FallenxGabe: is there alternate story after wrath classic?
[5:00:22] MarquisLek: wrath season of mastery
[5:00:22] Ryukotsu: Cant wait for Shadowlands classic Kappa
[5:00:24] Jigawatts42: because it finishes the story started in WC3, its the end of traditional WoW
[5:00:24] Stonefather: The amoutn of money from Cata Classic would be negative because the server costs Keepo
[5:00:27] cdk058: i mean some people liked cata but it will never be popular imo
[5:00:29] xaeblue: Hell naw
[5:00:30] TigeradamV: Hey boys, when does the cinematic happen today? In how many hours?
[5:00:30] AureliusXV: alll classic have flopped
[5:00:32] mavericks312: cata was better then pandaland
[5:00:32] Velirith: Cata is just the current game
[5:00:32] Fubarlogixx: honeslty forgot cata even existed
[5:00:32] Slaanesh74: I think Wrath will kind of suck with today's player mentality.
[5:00:33] Fluisterwoud: The impact wont be as huge as it was way back then.
[5:00:33] samaxis: I actually think Cata with some changes could be dope
[5:00:35] xantizz1: Shadowlands classic Pog!
[5:00:36] rohdey: you think you don't Kappa but you do
[5:00:36] mugwurt: Nobody wants Cata
[5:00:36] Saltytyphoon: oh natural oil
[5:00:38] swampt1l: Give me WoD Classic or death Kappa
[5:00:38] Luxembourger: what if they dont announce an expac but a WoW 2??
[5:00:39] Maytan26: Cata was the expansion that lost subscribers lol
[5:00:40] Tokies: mop and wod classic with an extra raid
[5:00:41] Dagomarus: Id play wrath classic just for DK Frost Tanking
[5:00:41] Kakotan2143: Cata isnt Classic
[5:00:41] yajje: Im waiting BFA classic bro
[5:00:42] SlideCancelXDD: A lot of classic streamers want it - they talk about it like it will happen 100% @Towelliee
[5:00:42] SkypexOnline: Wait.. whats the reason why Wotlk might be lsat classic?
[5:00:42] Praetour: WoW Classic Classic when??
[5:00:43] LightBladeStream: Cata wasn't really bad, but there is ZERO hype for it
[5:00:44] lord_windir: WoD classic
[5:00:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cataclysm doesn't have the nostalgia, but it's more content for that Classic crowd
[5:00:48] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: after wrath classic they will retcon cata
[5:00:49] pacificmc1: @Towelliee Keep in mind 8.3 had no new zone, 9.1 Korthia was barely a zone and no 9.3 at all... I don't think November is too unlikely tbh, they have cut a lot of corners the last 2 years
[5:00:49] blascotwitch: raids
[5:00:51] rohdey: but you can't DUAL SPEC
[5:00:51] madmike_99: wat
[5:00:54] alextheblight: @nilone4 sure is
[5:00:57] Klatrymadon: After Wrath classic it's WoW Classic Classic augNoted  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[5:00:57] Kakotan2143: Cata changed everything
[5:00:59] xaeblue: Cata ruined WoW for me, even though I kept trucking through 󠀀 󠀀
[5:00:59] Velirith: you can chromie time to wotlk too :P
[5:00:59] madmike_99: You can Chromie Time to Wrath too
[5:01:00] Stonefather: Well class changes, for example I'd say MoP was peak class design IMO.
[5:01:01] alextheblight: @nilhe gets around
[5:01:01] Forlagon: i feel like a lot of people lost interest in old expansions after classic didn't play out the way they expected.
[5:01:03] Tomlunner: Can't wait to farm torghast in shadowlands Classic YEP
[5:01:03] doubleOdan: people would probably prefer to just do vanilla - wotlk classic over again forever lol
[5:01:11] TwitchGurls: wrath in a league of its own
[5:01:11] Svendv: @pacificmc1 Never, we have another season left
[5:01:14] alextheblight: sorry, wrong guy
[5:01:15] avinater: gather all that ressiliance gear and prot pvp
[5:01:16] Maytan26: i hope they release fresh servers for wrath
[5:01:18] aladinsane909: Cata added the best race - goblins
[5:01:22] slamueljaksn: @Towelliee heya, u think they will ever allow cross faction guilds? i wana play horde but all my friends are alliance  :)
[5:01:27] pereadin: Goood morning all on this beautiful announcement day
[5:01:27] madmike_99: ahh I see
[5:01:35] arturiuss44: The only people who want Cata are the pvper's imho They claim most balanced pvp expansion.
[5:01:38] SlideCancelXDD: You dont like Wrath !? why? @Towelliee
[5:01:39] Velirith: after wotlk classic we get wotlk+
[5:01:41] pacificmc1: @Svendv Yeah true but it's not impossible they'll have 2 seasonns that are  the usual 4 month length as pre-shadowlands

[5:01:50] YungDizzY: You thing if u had played warcraft 3 u would have liked wrath better?
[5:01:53] LightBladeStream: This is a nice view
[5:02:07] Spec69: classic should end at WOTLK
[5:02:07] RPClipsGTA: shadowlands classic
[5:02:09] BoezIRL: only 5 hours towLets towGo towHAMUP
[5:02:09] h_u_r_k_: if wrath is the last xpac, then are they adding to the story within wrath, like mini episodes?
[5:02:12] invisiblematter: Red gmod pog
[5:02:13] Velirith: they are also spreading the playerbase too much
[5:02:16] Grandmarshal: Yeah agreed. Wrath is the last classic. But I think people are a little worried blizzard is gonna change wrath too much from its OG state.
[5:02:17] tetrahydridodinitrogen: If there is a new race think it will be locked behind a rep grind?
[5:02:20] Stonefather: After MoP there would be no need for classic, but I'm 100% fine stopping at Wrath
[5:02:20] Shredmuffn: cata is when ret pally finally got a kick
[5:02:21] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @RaysFTW (warning)
[5:02:21] 無職提督: till MoP?
[5:02:22] bchris13: wotlk classic plus is the way
[5:02:22] tino49: come on, Cataclysm has nothing to do with Shadowlands @Towelliee
[5:02:24] Compl1cated576: that's cataclysm
[5:02:26] xaeblue: I remember when people were trying to get murlocks and Naga as playable races lol back in tbc
[5:02:29] Svendv: @pacificmc1 yeah but they still need a few months to alpha + beta test the season (dungeons) and the new xpac. I hope it comes out fast but i just doubt it
[5:02:29] Ryukotsu: Classic classic but with M+ and mythic 10 man modes Keepo
[5:02:29] TheZander: I´d love a MOP classic, never played the expansion and I heard great things
[5:02:33] aladinsane909: Just jump to shadowlands Classic
[5:02:36] Orgabism: Eventually, the Classic game will catch up to retail, that's the plan :D
[5:02:41] Tomlunner: Probably most appealing thing would be the class differences i guess
[5:02:41] MadCowScurge: Yah Catta changed alot of zone stories.
[5:02:43] Velirith: they are also spreading the playerbase too much
[5:02:52] pacificmc1: @Svendv Yeah I doubt it too realistically, but lets say beta begins next month, then it could happen. Guess we'll know tonight anyway :D
[5:02:53] Stonefather: He knows monkaS
[5:02:54] TwitchGurls: wrath classic will dwarf all numbers

[5:03:24] reformedalex12345: id actually play legion cata classic never played it back in the day  󠀀
[5:03:25] Compl1cated576: In my opinion the main reason why cataclysm can't be classic is because it already has the current capital citys
[5:03:26] KragnosWoW: wow it felt like moments ago there was still 10 hours to go
[5:03:29] Ijee: they're just gonna make old content playable again so there's no need for cata classic I suppose

[5:04:26] Luxembourger: I just dont want 1) a mobile game or 2) wow becoming free to play
[5:04:28] jatsote: I would play cata classic over the new expansions

[5:37:04] Saltytyphoon: justin controller on
[5:37:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: There has so be some good ways that Microsoft can help with lag and connection issues that keep happening
[5:37:06] Phae__: WoW would be atrocious on console. Imagine PvPing? The macros...
[5:37:15] Rytten: Do you think the expansion will NOT be named dragonblight?

[5:37:51] biglos67: soldier healed
[5:37:55] Youredoneson666: there's also HELLA loot lag in dungeons sometimes
[5:38:00] herpderpdoublederp: I think the announcement will be POG
[5:38:02] Armdel: probably the type of lag you get when 100's of people fight the world bosses and similar stuff
[5:38:03] PvtHudson093: Put the World Bosses back in instances to reduce lag
[5:38:05] ence_nel_blu: maybe the "new expansion" lag
[5:38:15] Eikus11: oh I get to see some 9-5 live 2020Celebrate

[5:38:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the world boss loot can be turned into tier set
[5:38:47] SpratsTV: do you think they will officially announced wotlk classic as well or just retial expansion?
[5:38:49] Spathotan: Ive got chest and helm from the ZM world boss
[5:38:51] PToastman: Plate wearers are so lucky
[5:38:57] DwarfWarrior25: they were amazing

[5:39:09] madmike_99: SAME
[5:39:09] holychief26: Unpopular opinion - Nazjatar was awesome
[5:39:12] Aquadriel: world pvp in bfa was fucking banger
[5:39:13] madmike_99: World PvP is so dead
[5:39:13] DiiscoViking: that was a fun mech
[5:39:13] Phae__: Supply drops made world PvP legit
[5:39:14] DragonofWolves: I remember that. those were chaos
[5:39:17] Ijee: @SpratsTV probably both to please the investors
[5:39:22] Phae__: Nazjatar was amazing once you could fly
[5:39:28] Saltytyphoon: aisame
[5:39:33] Aquadriel: if not the best
[5:39:34] Yooosh_: naz pvp was sick when it was playable
[5:39:34] flebbooo: 8.2 EZ
[5:39:34] KragnosWoW: i missed 8.2 lol
[5:39:35] cdk058: it was awesome with flying
[5:39:35] Ghamera: before flying it was miserable
[5:39:36] The_Farting_Spaniard: @Phae__ True
[5:39:42] dillapuss: People fail to realize that Microsoft will be handling more the administrative side of the company, they will not directly affect in game issues.
[5:39:44] PToastman: It was great once you coiled fly
[5:39:46] coldhandsbeatz: They need to remove world bosses and turn them into 1 boss mini raids or something. Its a loot piñata thats lagged as fuck to get free chance of loot. It really serves no gameplay reason to be there
[5:39:46] Spathotan: Nazjatar was ass before you could fly though
[5:39:48] Tjc222: IMO Mechagon > Nazjatar
[5:39:50] DwarfWarrior25: i fucking loved Nazatar
[5:39:52] DragonofWolves: supply drops made pvp chaotic
[5:39:55] puntos97: @Towelliee Is it worth to come back now after 7 months break? or should i wait until next expansion release? :)
[5:40:00] SpratsTV: @SpratsTV thats what i was thinking but prolonged hype for different things is also good for the investors
[5:40:03] Xiephr_tactiX: WOTLK .... Wintergrasp ...super LAG
[5:40:05] Nightshaft25: 8 2 was good
[5:40:09] The_Farting_Spaniard: Just was annoying
[5:40:16] Ijee: @coldhandsbeatz exactly
[5:40:19] Phae__: Yeah, it wasn't bad. It was just instantly better when you could fly because of all the terrain
[5:40:24] bahartin: are we speedrunning 1-60?
[5:40:28] Thoreya: i played 8.2 an unhealthy amount of hours
[5:40:30] bahartin: or whats going on, i just joined :D
[5:40:34] Saltytyphoon: oh that sub under talent describes never
[5:40:36] FannyPackGirl: Korthia wasnt bad after you got flyi- oh wait
[5:40:45] Nightshaft25: 8.3 tho  SUCKSSSS
[5:40:48] bahartin: hell yea, just like i do <3
[5:40:49] holychief26: I would have loved to have seen them do Ny'alotha as a ZONE, and not a raid. But I understand we had to fight N'zoth in their
[5:40:53] The_Farting_Spaniard: A casual 17.5hrs lmfao I love it
[5:40:55] Thoreya: 9.1 was so trash
[5:40:55] Ijee: @FannyPackGirl they could remove all those catch up zones for all I care
[5:40:56] Dashuria: how much play time do we have left for the char?
[5:41:11] Ghamera: heroic leap and korthia do not mix
[5:41:13] Layercake: The Maw was amazing after all Kappa
[5:41:14] Ghamera: i hate it
[5:41:17] dwebster7689: How are you enjoying the melee hunter so far ?
[5:41:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Korthia was eh....I thought it was alright, but that Consumption boss was awful
[5:41:22] FannyPackGirl: @FannyPackGirl I still need some mounts from there unfortunately
[5:41:24] Nightshaft25: LUL
[5:41:25] Im_a_sad_man: korthia isnt even a zone its purgatory LUL
[5:41:29] Thoreya: do we like bfa zones more than SL zones?
[5:41:33] Rytten: i never understood the purpose of the art of learning flying twice in the same expansion
[5:41:35] Saltytyphoon: miss her
[5:41:37] Stonefather: Lord Mazdamundi PogChamp Clap
[5:41:39] Phae__: If they just allowed movement skills to work in Korthia like they do in ZM, it would've been that much better
[5:41:44] Only1Ammo: GitrogMonster?
[5:41:48] Ijee: @Rytten it's content KEKW
[5:41:49] pacificmc1: Kapp
[5:41:50] pacificmc1: Kappa
[5:41:53] madmike_99: True
[5:41:54] leinadnoss: that is one strong bridge for it to be able to support that fucking frog
[5:41:55] pacificmc1: Bastion only good zone
[5:41:55] DiiscoViking: very well drawn
[5:41:57] scaleses1: Kappa
[5:41:57] Ghamera: I love volduun more than most
[5:41:58] cdk058: i only liked bastion
[5:41:59] ILikeKillTheZombies: maldraxxus is my least liked zone
[5:42:00] Just_Jaybles: BFA was better than shadowlands
[5:42:01] Cafe0le: nah them being disconnected sucks big time
[5:42:01] madmike_99: Bastion is one of my favourite zones in the entire game now
[5:42:02] holychief26: Bastion art was amazing. Ardenweld was fucking beautiful. Maldrex was ..... eh
[5:42:03] ILikeKillTheZombies: in the game
[5:42:04] Thoreya: revendreth and ardenweald were cool
[5:42:05] KragnosWoW: bastion bis
[5:42:08] pacificmc1: BFA zones were so much better
[5:42:09] Yooosh_: i much prefer bfa over slands dungeons imo 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[5:42:11] Orirholim: I liked Shadowlands as well. Everything had it's own theme.
[5:42:11] Endogenous_: I definitely preferred BFA zones.  I enjoyed revendreth in SL tho
[5:42:12] vadder_fister: bastion eye cancer dont @ me
[5:42:13] Spathotan: Anybody saying the zones were bad are just clowning because the story is bad
[5:42:15] Phae__: Revendreth was super cool for the theme
[5:42:15] MarquisLek: ardenweald was dope
[5:42:17] Saltytyphoon: is that for justin us
[5:42:17] Rexialiton: purgatory?
[5:42:17] Layercake: The base SL zones were great...the add ones not really
[5:42:21] Aquadriel: Zones were great, the questing experience was meh @Towelliee
[5:42:21] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:42:22] Tjc222: Drustvar was probably one of the best zones in the last 2 xpacs.
[5:42:24] madmike_99: TRRUEEE
[5:42:24] Dashuria: covenant zones are pretty
[5:42:25] Kisswani: Ardenweald is one of the best zones they've ever made imo . Revendreth was cool as well
[5:42:26] Phae__: Exactly
[5:42:28] jamarky23: They are just copy paste tho of environmental design no destinct landmarks
[5:42:30] Samurai3434: A buffer class would be cool. You could spec into one that does more dmg mitigation, or dmg buffs, or utility including cc and rez etc. Bit of everything
[5:42:30] Mistery836: zones weren't all that big either
[5:42:30] ILikeKillTheZombies: i personally prefer bfa zones because they were more "open" like stormsong valley
[5:42:31] Phae__: Zones need to mean something again
[5:42:31] bahartin: the zones initially are really good but i think you grow distain for it after doing world quests for 2 months straight lol
[5:42:32] Inthezonewow: Bastion was so bright it ruined my eye sight LUL
[5:42:35] Saltytyphoon: oh a book
[5:42:35] TheZander: BIG trueeee
[5:42:35] holychief26: @Towelliee 100% agree. It was all about the rush to end game.
[5:42:36] madmike_99: There should be more open world endgame content
[5:42:38] skymercii: unpoplaur opinion: maldraxxus is the best zone
[5:42:44] flebbooo: Overall SL had better zones, Ardenweald alone is just amazing looking.  For bfa i personally really liked Zuldazar and the Kul trias zones
[5:42:48] buddybeerbruh: I miss the Rusty, slimy, decaying corpses look that Naxx had
[5:42:54] Phae__: Using zones for 2 levels then having no good reason to revisit them during the rest of the expansion is pretty bleh
[5:42:56] arturiuss44: Revendreth reminded me of some dystopian movie set it was pretty great.
[5:42:57] Maytan26: i wish shadowlands zones were connected
[5:43:16] SensationalBanana: !uptime
[5:43:17] Saltytyphoon: um fu
[5:43:20] coldhandsbeatz: No leveling next expansion. Its pointless nowadays.
[5:43:23] Aquadriel: @Towelliee SL zones were better looking than BfA's but the lvling experience/quests in BfA was much better i'd say
[5:43:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Turtles!
[5:43:26] cappei: Meh, leveling has always been shit to me. Just a time waster to get to the real content. I know other people feel otherwise, but that's just me
[5:43:27] holychief26: And now we are at the end game - ppl have nothing to do. They need to get back to making lvling enjoyable and make catch up in raid easier somehow.
[5:43:52] Kneckt: @Towelliee that logo is 100% real, the R in World is exactly the same as their new logo as seen in the expansion reveal youtube screen
[5:44:04] trashedskeletor: as long as leveling alts is a lot quicker im good with longer leveling on mains only once though
[5:44:06] nvnto: same
[5:44:06] Rytten: make levelling accountwide when u lvl to max lvl u lvl all character to max lvl
[5:44:11] Ghamera: on 15 alts?
[5:44:11] Svendv: i dont mind it BUT i do on my alts
[5:44:16] thorined: Leveling in Drustvar was litty on a stack
[5:44:18] Aquadriel: @Towelliee it didnt help that SL wqs were tedious as fuck and people didnt wanna do them
[5:44:18] Saltytyphoon: shura sure sue so sue shit should swatches!?
[5:44:19] Renzay83: cant the half the exp needed when you get a main to max lvl?
[5:44:29] DiiscoViking: should have been 8hrs per zone
[5:44:38] Awesm_mossm: I still have a hard time seeing a hunter full on melee dps...just weird to see
[5:44:38] madmike_99: I don't mind fast levelling, I want more stuff to do at max level inside these zones. Not make them obsolete after just 1 patch or something
[5:44:43] holychief26: I think the zone being fun heavily depends on the story. No one reads quests text anymore - maybe more cutscenes and cinematics and dialogue instead of quest text. Aint no one reading that
[5:44:45] TheZander: one is fun, twice is a chore, everything after that is a slap in the face
[5:44:46] SensationalBanana: SensationalBanana subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 67 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I really hope they make heirlooms available as soon as you reach max level on 1 character, if we will level in 10.0.
[5:44:47] nvnto: wait, the chest isnt azerite anymore?
[5:44:47] Mistery836: if you would level an alt you would fly through it anyway KEKW
[5:44:47] stabzmcgeee: @Saltytyphoon sir are you ok?
[5:44:51] Phae__: Decrease lvling time for alts and make rep account wide. Huge QoL upgrades
[5:44:53] Cafe0le: dont make us level ever again LUL
[5:45:00] ItsBorland: Theres about to be a fuckload of people coming to see this reveal lmfao
[5:45:01] EXPchadr: EXPchadr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 101 months, currently on a 101 month streak! 
[5:45:03] ILikeKillTheZombies: it was more annoying
[5:45:04] madmike_99: Yeah wtf was that World Quest 2.0
[5:45:06] Armdel: world quests, but worse
[5:45:06] Saltytyphoon: not stabbed
[5:45:07] holychief26: I loved the Nazjatar world quests.
[5:45:08] flebbooo: More like Wquest 0.5 KEKW
[5:45:08] ILikeKillTheZombies: 3 phased world quests
[5:45:09] WhiteKnight74648: 2.0 means twice as long
[5:45:09] LevelSixNidoran: 4 hours pog
[5:45:09] yuvalal: do you prefer mroe 10 level or down 10 level?
[5:45:11] Phae__: WQs got way worse. Do a lot more for no better rewards
[5:45:12] mavericks312: but wait till 3.0 WQs
[5:45:14] holychief26: I wished the did more puzzle ones.
[5:45:20] Yooosh_: i prefer emissaries to callings too 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[5:45:27] cappei: but but... now you have to pick up your emissary quests yourself. Truly revolutionary
[5:45:27] dracullus: @Towelliee emissaries are way better now (except the part you have to pick up the quest)
[5:45:28] jtobiaz: they shouldve just let the OG group finder. those were good times with WQ
[5:45:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: The only change I noticed is that the loot stopped being relevant quicker....I vendored 95% of the rewards
[5:45:29] Saltytyphoon: ty
[5:45:32] KragnosWoW: i would rather have 8 hours of quality leveling content then 40 hours of stretched out content that has only 8 hours of quality within the 40 hours
[5:45:33] burgerkingyo: im so glad zereth'mortis wqs went back to the good old familiar bfa/legion style
[5:45:37] Gingerprimer: Yeah like the fact that you have to pick up callings each day
[5:45:37] Tiger2hunt: WQ 3.0 is gonna be a scenario mode
[5:45:45] Aquadriel: WQs >>>> Daylies
[5:45:45] cjsgambe: i hope so im tired of chores
[5:45:47] Fluisterwoud: Ì dont mind wq's, just make them fun?
[5:45:48] yuvalal: i hope not.
[5:45:49] luckfore: Ive barely done any wqs in SL
[5:45:49] xziyn: HE KNNOWS
[5:45:51] Thoreya: i liked bfa wqs and emissaries
[5:45:52] gooni_coyg: I am so hyped for new expansion that my random mount buttom only summons all my different dragon mounts :D
[5:45:52] Phae__: Just give us back emissary quests and give me WQs where I can go kill one guy.
[5:45:53] Thoreya: that was fine
[5:45:54] risetta: I like WQs they are dailies but without having to run back and forth to quest givers
[5:45:54] holychief26: Puzzle world quests or riot
[5:45:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no shot
[5:45:57] Stonefather: He knows burkeSus
[5:46:03] mavericks312: can we bring back scenario's that take us through book lore
[5:46:05] flebbooo: @burgerkingyo True actually, they feel a lot more like them
[5:46:06] madmike_99: tbh I enjoy world quests. I want more varied ones, and more ones that require organic grouping (no group finder). More GW2 event vibes. Make the open world more alive.
[5:46:11] Ansirox: Hope we get Suramar 2.0 on Dragon Isles!
[5:46:11] Phae__: Literally 0 motivation to do WQs because they take so long. Pass on the 20 WQ weekly every time.
[5:46:18] superio29: Yeah contanent quests lol xd
[5:46:21] Just_Jaybles: Need account wide endgame and skips for ALTs,i would play more but i really cba with the 20+ hours of repeating the same shit i have done on my main but getting into the end game
[5:46:25] Gingerprimer: Emissareis got auto picked up callings you have to pick up in your base for some reason
[5:46:35] Svendv: the mastery bell
[5:46:35] Fluisterwoud: that bell thing
[5:46:37] pavepawns: the bell?
[5:46:38] MundiPlays: still op
[5:46:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: We used to have to do WQ's for conduits.....and that was annoying
[5:46:47] pavepawns: the wakeners fond
[5:46:49] pavepawns: the leaf
[5:46:50] Svendv: the haste thingy?
[5:46:50] luckfore: hymnal
[5:46:51] wildheittv: Frond?
[5:46:51] morb1um: the crystal
[5:46:52] Tirantus17: how much longer till announcement? I'm bored and stuck in dead traffic for a hour now lol
[5:46:55] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @Renzay83 (warning)
[5:46:55] reggiepowa: @Phae__ there is a bunch of short wqs but you gotta know which ones they are
[5:46:57] gooni_coyg: I am so hyped for new expansion that my random mount buttom only summons all my different dragon mounts :D
[5:47:00] eldacal: frond, the leaf thing
[5:47:02] BestGrizzlyEU: hymnal of the path
[5:47:03] Thoreya: @Stopnsmellmynutz LUL
[5:47:06] eldacal: gave haste
[5:47:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: the leaf
[5:47:27] Phae__: @Phae__ I mean, sure, but not as short as killing 1 guy like you could in legion in BFA. Those don't exist anymore
[5:47:32] coldhandsbeatz: Imagine playing for fun instead of for rewards. What they need to do with world content is make it super fun some way without attaching player power to it. Also some cool cosmetic rewards that you can earn over time or something to progress
[5:47:36] MarquisLek: did the world quests to get rep and paragon chest rewards and stopped doing them after that
[5:47:44] holychief26: @coldhandsbeatz this
[5:47:49] Tirantus17: how much longer till announcement?
[5:47:50] reggiepowa: AngelThump
[5:47:58] shaaadeey: Dragon time soon
[5:48:00] KragnosWoW: im using the infinite timereaver
[5:48:05] EscapePlan01: why do they restrict playtime on this char??
[5:48:07] mavericks312: @coldhandsbeatz no one is touching abything that doesnt give player power
[5:48:08] trashedskeletor: ill never have that mount :) 400+ pulls heheh
[5:48:22] Saltytyphoon: do it bow/
[5:48:23] Orirholim: @coldhandsbeatz mmos are about progess and grinding at a base level
[5:48:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like the concept of always increasing power, no matter what content
[5:48:33] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: boomer
[5:48:42] coldhandsbeatz: @mavericks312 have you ever heard of the mage tower? Might be something that people never touch
[5:48:55] mmrghost7: EXACTLY
[5:48:57] Layercake: Fun is subjective...getting better gear is not HahaThink
[5:48:59] Jokervenom1978: I have fun by getting loot.
[5:49:03] Zettabyte: Numbrrrrr
[5:49:05] Orirholim: HUGE dps
[5:49:08] Ziddrax: then why are we stuck with low numbers for dmg ?
[5:49:08] alive_by_day: whats the best class to level atm?
[5:49:12] mmrghost7: who the fk wants to shrink down
[5:49:13] holychief26: Why do players story mode games then? For the story. Bring the story to the groups and allow ppl to enjoy it together.
[5:49:14] Aquadriel: problem is if oyu give power on world quests, raiders cry
[5:49:15] TheRukis: you t5alking about better scaling world quest items?
[5:49:18] PipTown: rewards need to be good, look at GW2 some of the most fun metas are dead because they arent rewarding but the boring crappy ones are always filled as they have high gold per hour
[5:49:19] fletch8: i want an under the sea EXP
[5:49:26] coldhandsbeatz: Rewarded but in a way that its not a chore is what I wanted to say. Mage tower rewarding but not torghast chore level
[5:49:30] NiteLancer: I wish casual bgs were more fun. Seems more of a slog of getting dunked on
[5:49:33] 210Crawler: Good morning Towelliee and Hammer Squad towHAMUP
[5:49:38] Carahail: Morning all
[5:49:39] Mistery836: a problem with wow is that half the lore is in seperate books too LUL
[5:49:50] Ijee: @fletch8 you think you do but you don't
[5:49:52] Murdock26: I’d love to try out WOW but only getting to play 1-2hrs a day kinda handcuffs me
[5:49:56] yba_cribaby9000: Just don’t make questing mandatory like it is now
[5:49:58] Yooosh_: no one wants to replay the same story quest over and over
[5:50:09] Phae__: @NiteLancer The power creep in BGs is real. It's probably the only place I'm fine with scaling. Scale PvP in unrated content. Make it real ilvl in rated.
[5:50:14] mavericks312: @Mistery836 bringback scenariosthat are just book lore
[5:50:23] Carahail: Party100 Party100 Party100 Party100 Party100
[5:50:24] DeanoTV: true, they used to enjoy doing dailies now call it a chore LUL
[5:50:26] Stonefather: It is a chore, just logging in is a chore nowadays Keepo
[5:50:27] holychief26: Torghast WAS fun. For the first month, but they needed to update powers regularly
[5:50:28] tronbadgames: @Towelliee dailies are a chore - just because its an easy one doesnt make it different
[5:50:31] havenbirch: I'd not mind a Torghast 2.0, but in Karazhan
[5:50:32] alive_by_day: HSWP HSWP HSWP HSWP
[5:50:34] larrylegend36: @Yooosh_ u literally dont have to anymore
[5:50:35] ndilicious: I enjoyed the MoP dailies
[5:50:35] Zettabyte: Dailies? pepeMeltdown
[5:50:37] Valandryl_: @towelliee do you have any insights if Blizzards planning on tuning Wrath difficulty a bit? Otherwise gonna be kinda pepega
[5:50:39] Xiephr_tactiX: Dailies = natural part of the game?
[5:50:40] EscapePlan01: @murdock26 not true man, you can achieve a lot with 2 hours a day. OK you might not be mythic raiding or whatever but can still have fun
[5:50:41] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i mean people even consider the vault a chore so blizz can never win
[5:50:47] DeanoTV: true, they used to enjoy doing dailies now call it a chore. LUL
[5:50:51] FallenxGabe: time-gating sucks
[5:50:53] KragnosWoW: they also should have their goal have you log in for 40 hours a week though
[5:50:56] DavidBrutal123: or maybe, not every day, just the goal to be min 5-6 hours a week
[5:50:57] byrdeen45: they really need to put something like chaos dungeon in wow love it from lost ark
[5:50:58] KragnosWoW: shouldnt
[5:51:02] Armdel: problem is blizzard answer to that is bad grinds and time gating
[5:51:03] holychief26: Vault is a chore - NGL
[5:51:05] x_WARR1OR_x: biggwar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[5:51:07] tronbadgames: thats what a chore is.. stuff to do lol
[5:51:08] Zandilar: I tend to stop playing when the story stops.
[5:51:11] Reckless_Monk: blizz devs are probably taking YoshiPs stand
[5:51:12] Valandryl_: towelliee do you have any insights if Blizzards planning on tuning Wrath difficulty a bit? Otherwise gonna be kinda pepega :)
[5:51:12] Mistery836: @mavericks312 as in they should add that, or that's already in the game and I just don't know about it? but ye. they should add that.
[5:51:15] tronbadgames: so many people using that term like its cancer
[5:51:17] Thoreya: so what in the game is not a chore?
[5:51:18] Buckwink: vault is not a fucking chore
[5:51:18] Thoreya: lol
[5:51:24] buddybeerbruh: Instead of more loot they should focus on making stuff feel rewarding and special like in earlier expansions
[5:51:27] Buckwink: dont want more options? dont fucking do it
[5:51:27] mavericks312: @Mistery836 as in they should add that
[5:51:28] Velirith: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[5:51:32] holychief26: you have to do it - to get the max gear the fastest - BUT thats also because the personal loot system is Garbage
[5:51:33] Phae__: But the Vault can feel like the only reward you get some weeks because loot drops are so scare in M+ and raiding.
[5:51:34] Aquadriel: only time you had to be logged in so much was legion, bfa reduced that by more than half
[5:51:35] Tjc222: WOTLK music is the best
[5:51:35] Orirholim: @Stopnsmellmynutz BFA and Shadowlands pretty much do, you follow a storyline
[5:51:35] PToastman: Vault isn’t alt friendly
[5:51:42] Stonefather: It really do be.
[5:51:44] Zandilar: on the other hand, I stopped playing Shadowlands because of the scandal.
[5:51:45] BionicMagician: R4venScythe is gifting 3 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 80 in the channel! 
[5:51:46] Harok9: AngelThump
[5:51:46] BionicMagician: R4venScythe gifted a Tier 1 sub to KennyLems! 
[5:51:46] BionicMagician: R4venScythe gifted a Tier 1 sub to NiteLancer! 
[5:51:46] BionicMagician: R4venScythe gifted a Tier 1 sub to The_Boctor! 
[5:51:50] Velirith: TBAngel TBAngel TBAngel
[5:51:50] tronbadgames: @Towelliee what in RL isn't a chore? this logic is bonkers
[5:51:51] assman_ny: Character selection
[5:51:51] WhiteKnight74648: AngelThump
[5:51:51] Todmeister9000: This world is a chore!
[5:51:52] Rytten: Why dont they let the cinematic team make decisions for wow they nail it every time
[5:51:52] xSoldierhardx: Accessibility is #1 priority from Blizz
[5:51:52] KragnosWoW: lost ark feels like a chore thats why im taking a break from it temporarily
[5:51:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: logging out
[5:51:54] Velirith: AngelThumpAngelThumpAngelThump
[5:51:55] xxlegitghostxx: it should atleast have you long in a couple hours a day
[5:51:55] mavericks312: the new age gamer attention span is so short these days
[5:51:56] Velirith: AngelThump
[5:52:00] Aldasaris: man they did arthas so dirty in shadowlands
[5:52:02] Stonefather: Arthas, my son AngelThump
[5:52:02] DavidBrutal123: its the same since vanilla, you can consider everything a chore
[5:52:04] The_Farting_Spaniard: Imagine playing a game thats supposed to be fun and viewing it as just another chore
[5:52:04] Buckwink: its typically the players who dont actually do any chores that complain about chores
[5:52:06] Roffejow: Still, feels like there are too many chores in modern wow (I quit retail in legion). You had to go do a bunch of shit every single day to keep up. I personally would prefer if I was able to do it all once a week, rather than having to do it every day.
[5:52:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeehah!!!
[5:52:09] Naturalbeef: My house becomes more powerful  every time I do yard work
[5:52:09] holychief26: @Phae__ Vault wouldnt be required if they fixed the loot system though. The only reason you do it is so you dont fall behind on gear,
[5:52:10] Orirholim: 4 20!
[5:52:10] templarofboingo: Should be able to bank a “daily” for a few days just for the people who can’t get on every single day like clock work
[5:52:12] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @deifypog (warning)
[5:52:17] Dongtanian: yeah logging in do be a chore. gotta click that icon, remember my password, wait for load
[5:52:18] S3N71: Which WA is that?  I like the experience bar at the top
[5:52:21] Phae__: @Phae__ Exactly.
[5:52:23] CptKekkin: give me the new runeterra mmo
[5:52:30] NiteLancer: @R4venScythe thanks!
[5:52:40] Cafe0le: thats not true what
[5:52:51] Otton_03: The Lost Ark rest bonus would be nice for WoW
[5:52:52] Bigmann109: What do you about day login rewards?
[5:52:52] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[5:52:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think this time balancing is where a rested bonus comes in
[5:52:57] TheAtomHour: I just want to feel like the game design respects my time
[5:53:09] Roffejow: @templarofboingo This!
[5:53:12] Reckless_Monk: @towelliee did Twitch take your Subtrain celebrstion and make it a feature?
[5:53:15] gooni_coyg: tbh shadowlands vault is a big win. Hope they keep it or make it even better if u can do that
[5:53:16] Ziddrax: you wont be able to do a +15 because you wouldnt have the score
[5:53:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: For the first couple of hours, players get a boost, but they can still keep working after that
[5:53:37] Carahail: you were in his poison
[5:53:39] sin338: surely its around choice a minimum amount of hours needed each week to maintain but then those of use that want to push harder and longer can if they choose too
[5:53:43] Phae__: If you're playing once a week or with that once a week mindset, youre not going to be geared enough for 15s. That's why M+ or other sources of loot need to be more rewarding to non-casual players.
[5:53:46] atowellthatiallreadyused: i bought apple wine and strawberry wine 15% for expansion reveal lets ZUG ZUG Together towelliee lok tar ogar
[5:54:00] atowellthatiallreadyused: you also having some good drinks ?
[5:54:04] Hawkseye: Missing a day of dailies/other gains in Lost Ark didnt feel as bad since it accumulated over to other days. I really liked that system tbh
[5:54:08] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[5:54:08] mavericks312: you should have to grind on atleast 1 toon
[5:54:09] nvnto: They can bump up my main progress, if I dont have to do it again on an alt
[5:54:11] sumppitupa: remember the time when you used to get loot from a dungeon. oh man.
[5:54:11] Dongtanian: things only feel like a chore when i have to do them again on alts
[5:54:13] Tjc222: Agreed
[5:54:15] Saltytyphoon: ya magic ark alone never
[5:54:18] midagro: 100% agree
[5:54:19] DeanoTV: true
[5:54:22] Orirholim: @Phae__ if you can only play a mmo once a week, are mmos really for you?
[5:54:23] Spathotan: Imagine having to play the game
[5:54:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, some work makes sense
[5:54:24] rymerre: hold up...work?
[5:54:25] MannLikeNick: Why does everyone expect it to be easy
[5:54:25] lithium364: heresy
[5:54:26] MortiousPrime: I think you need to be able to switch which one is your main, but I agree - you should have to do the work ONCE
[5:54:27] Bigmann109: @towelliee what do you think about daily login rewards?
[5:54:29] Zettabyte: Logging in is an effort, Towel Kappa
[5:54:32] Mistery836: go the ff14 route and allow all classes on one character. :P
[5:54:45] rymerre: if your brand new your not flying at all
[5:54:46] Antdavs24: Let me work on my main but give me freedom for alts
[5:54:48] DeanoTV: @Mistery836 no. keep that shit in FF, this is WoW
[5:54:49] Saltytyphoon: filed depth
[5:55:00] burgerkingyo: of course you gotta get work done on ur main just not on ur alts, i wanna go get my skull bashed in arenas when i play an alt not refarm the same bullshit
[5:55:01] Just_Jaybles: agree, but do the work once though
[5:55:01] Armdel: i would be fine if gear grinding was the only thing i had to do on alts
[5:55:04] precision79: im good with the game as it is pretty much but i cant stand the mandatory mechanics like covenants and so on that make you fall behind if you dont do them every single day. Reps and daily quests in wotlk for example were so much better
[5:55:06] Buckwink: work your way up in M+ like we all did
[5:55:06] Mistery836: and your reason is...
[5:55:06] mavericks312: @Mistery836 nobody wants that shit in wow lol
[5:55:10] coldhandsbeatz: 100%. Account wide stuff should be things like currencies (timewalking badges, for instace), reps, and story skips
[5:55:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I want my satisfaction NOW
[5:55:11] Phae__: @Orirholim Probably not. That wasn't the argument, though. Towelie said that if you do a +15 you still get a 278 piece in the vault. That's true, but if that is someone's approach to the game, they're not going to be geared for 15s in the first place.
[5:55:12] JareBear813: systems should be account wide, not gear. Gear you need to work for, and its rewarding.
[5:55:14] maalow: i like the lost ark way of making alts relevant for your main progression
[5:55:16] Rytten: The problem is not the gear it is the entry to get gear
[5:55:26] Just_Jaybles: even if its like 50 -100 hours on you main, then all your alts should have easu skips and catch ups, including rep grinds
[5:55:27] Velirith: Just bring back currency to buy tier sets and im happy like ICC
[5:55:34] Lazugo: https://twitter.com/Stiven_SRB/status/1516380708599701507 Stiven has spoken @Towelliee
[5:55:37] atowellthatiallreadyused: Towellie are you having any good drinks for reveal im having apple wine for example LOK TAR OGAR
[5:55:40] Aquadriel: @Towelliee people want to treat wow like a moba, just log in day 1 and be able to do harder lvl content, no progress or shit.
[5:55:44] gooni_coyg: posthaste talent
[5:55:50] eexplo: i want it hard af with rewarding gear and big damage. Scaling progression to be able to feel the improvements piece by piece
[5:55:50] Crocfacex: if your running pot haste yep
[5:55:59] dranet11: gender... wtf
[5:55:59] DeanoTV: ooo sheeeet
[5:56:00] Thoreya: PH BOY
[5:56:01] szble: gender? 󠀀
[5:56:02] Svendv: new gender LUL
[5:56:02] Awesm_mossm: @towelliee I just feel that WoW can't afford to do that anymore...MMO's have to evolve now as MMO's as re not the same as they used to be....basically more people want accessibility and less of a grind to get the best stuff now days. I like the old school feeling of grinding it out but I'm in the minority now days I feel
[5:56:03] vadder_fister: KEKW
[5:56:04] cappei: Gender OMEGALUL No way
[5:56:04] raye_gaming22: wait waht ?

[5:56:07] Fluisterwoud: Gender..good god
[5:56:08] MMokuin: gender wtf?
[5:56:09] gosimius: @towelliee  do you want new class or not needed?
[5:56:09] NoSelfJustice: problem is, blizzard never find the balance between someone who can sit there 8-12 hours a day. to the people who can play 3-6 hours a day.  they tip the scales one way or the other.
[5:56:10] mavericks312: new race confirmed boys
[5:56:12] Saltytyphoon: lotus intertwine
[5:56:12] pixxelina: gender? lol
[5:56:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tinker! Tinkerrrrrrrr!!
[5:56:12] shaaadeey: 4 new classes
[5:56:14] Deminnika: why even play the game, Just put up a long term test center where you never have to work for anything.
[5:56:15] pavepawns: how would they give you a new gender?
[5:56:16] Waiden01: oh god :D
[5:56:16] yuvalal: gender?
[5:56:17] DeanoTV: pls no new gender wtf KEKW
[5:56:17] shaaadeey: rumors
[5:56:18] dranet11: im out
[5:56:20] TheRukis: how the fuck do you get a new gender?
[5:56:20] Spathotan: Oh no lol
[5:56:20] FranciscoTheMage: get a new gender?
[5:56:21] PToastman: Stop it
[5:56:22] kaya4tw: it's not about doing the campaing once, it's about doing it on every alt. If there is timegate on everything, cap on every currency, I really don't want to do campaings on my alts to be able to play the game more
[5:56:25] bukka_hot: oh no no no
[5:56:25] 91Niki: Gender neutral maybe? 🤷
[5:56:25] ticma94: more nice and easy PC SJW points lets goo
[5:56:26] Layercake: new gender...oh boy duckCringe
[5:56:27] ThePawPaw: pepeMeltdown ITS HAPPENING everybody calm DOWN

[5:56:28] Svendv: new gender: apache helicopter
[5:56:28] ticma94: lmao
[5:56:30] aribellae: @Towelliee Doesn't this just feel like the classic gen x vs millennial clash?
[5:56:31] Stonefather: Going down the rabbit how I see.
[5:56:31] Jokervenom1978: towStop towIt
[5:56:33] Waiden01: in that case we need 100 more genders :D
[5:56:33] FranciscoTheMage: theres no other gender... it would be gender neut
[5:56:34] Tjc222: Non binary here I come Kappa
[5:56:35] Toradin: yep dicks
[5:56:37] burgerkingyo: who cares about a new gender
[5:56:39] Stonefather: rabbit hole*
[5:56:39] Meliea_EU: what time is that reveal, how many hours
[5:56:39] cappei: If you've seen WoW devs on Twitter you'd realise adding new gender would be the exact thing they'd do LUL
[5:56:40] Nelyu: oh god please no
[5:56:41] Fluisterwoud: still male or female dragons
[5:56:41] DragonofWolves: gender meaning new race probably..
[5:56:42] Thoreya: towStop towIt towStop towIt towStop towIt towStop towIt
[5:56:42] MortiousPrime: I mean, dragons are reptilian, which have two genders
[5:56:43] Xiephr_tactiX: right, imagine next race is gender neutral
[5:56:45] coldhandsbeatz: I cant wait to see people get mad at it too
[5:56:46] Erielle04: @Svendv Didn't you know there 200 differant genders LUL
[5:56:46] giggachadwar: Genderless
[5:56:47] Kneckt: ok guys lets not get too toxic
[5:56:48] Waiden01: new gender each monthly patch
[5:56:49] Jokervenom1978: There are male and female dragons.
[5:56:51] mavericks312: probably an inclusivity thing @Towelliee
[5:56:51] raye_gaming22: if this shit is woke murica gender then i quit for good
[5:56:54] iVukan: probably a race that you cannot tell male or female so no gender aka "new gender" aka "3rd gender"
[5:56:56] assman_ny: Lol
[5:56:57] CosmicPooky: LUL chat is something today
[5:56:58] Saltytyphoon: linear bass build won
[5:57:00] Thoreya: im fucking cracking up
[5:57:01] MortiousPrime: I mean, if there are genderless races like Ethereals, that makes sense
[5:57:02] PToastman: Pump the breaks
[5:57:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: toxic EU chat KEKW
[5:57:04] geokouts: there are 3 genders : male, female and Apache Attack Hellicopter!
[5:57:06] DeanoTV: @Towelliee if they make EVERYTHING account wide, people will be so happy guaranteed
[5:57:07] Meliea_EU: i rpefer not to read about sexuality or genders in my mmo
[5:57:09] FranciscoTheMage: ?
[5:57:12] oscowski: this chat OMEGALUL
[5:57:13] lithium364: 3 gender race=banned in china
[5:57:14] UnholyLP: so mechagnome? Kappa
[5:57:20] coldhandsbeatz: People will complain more about a non binary or gender neutral gender than any system you can possibly imagine lol lame
[5:57:21] ItsEddieAU: some dude threatening to quit in chat if they add a new gender OMEGALUL who gives a fuck
[5:57:22] FranciscoTheMage: its gender neut
[5:57:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear tank can do it!
[5:57:23] KragnosWoW: are you sure they werent drunk trying to say agenda?
[5:57:28] 3663Sharad: Dont open that box of pandora with the genders monkaS
[5:57:28] Rexialiton: EU chat never toxic OMEGALUL
[5:57:29] buddybeerbruh: Id be ok with generds if they add some sort of wierd alien race
[5:57:30] szeeman62: Nope futas for everyone!
[5:57:31] Saltytyphoon: good
[5:57:33] FranciscoTheMage: LOL
[5:57:34] FranciscoTheMage: agenda
[5:57:35] Thoreya: how to trigger chat with 1 word: gender
[5:57:38] Lupusdeus: Wouldn't affect me in the slightest, genuinely don't care, but ppl already "OMG I QUIT" - absolute clowns LUL
[5:57:40] Scoodles91: can we keep the rainbow stuff out of wow pls
[5:57:40] atowellthatiallreadyused: Towellie are you having any good drinks for reveal im having apple wine for example LOK TAR OGAR ??
[5:57:42] TheRukis: didn't they say race in the same sentence?
[5:57:43] Tjc222: @Meliea_EU but you already pick between male and female......
[5:57:46] Kisswani: some of you mfers choose the weirdest hills to die one . even if it's a new gender , are you really gonna quit over it ?
[5:57:48] PToastman: My mechagnome is named hitachi
[5:57:51] Waiden01: Instead of new races wow will get new genders each expansion :D
[5:57:57] mmrghost7: i miss this crazy chick in 20+ when ppl didnt interrupt the casts
[5:57:58] InceptionGod: @Towelliee ready for that Wrath?
[5:57:58] maalow: i'm ready for a dragon-like race
[5:58:03] Saltytyphoon: not gene lights
[5:58:04] FranciscoTheMage: this is like people on twitter being triggered by a female thor @Towelliee
[5:58:05] bukka_hot: @Waiden90  KEKW
[5:58:08] gooni_coyg: kill shot u mean :D
[5:58:10] Orirholim: @Kisswani chat has been hilarious since the stream started tbh
[5:58:16] Honvar: Hello there!
[5:58:25] Saltytyphoon: yours forever
[5:58:29] Thoreya: sounds fucking lit to me
[5:58:35] Saltytyphoon: we got raves
[5:58:35] pacificmc1: Sounds barebones
[5:58:36] lithium364: its like legion, all out
[5:58:37] rymerre: no way
[5:58:38] TheRukis: @Towelliee where did you see this?
[5:58:38] Naamverloren: Gender?? like wtf what will we get then?
[5:58:38] Kisswani: @Orirholim I guess goes with the expansion day LUL
[5:58:40] Aquadriel: Tinkers of Tinkeria confirmed @Towelliee
[5:58:40] rymerre: thats a bit much
[5:58:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pleeease don't be 1-spec classes lol
[5:58:43] byrdeen45: come on enganeer
[5:58:43] xFevers: New Gender? I see they are focusing on the right stuff....
[5:58:44] mavericks312: gender and race for sure
[5:58:48] Zandilar: new gender, maybe non binary?
[5:58:51] Rexialiton: I'm so freaking hyped for the reveal.. can't wait
[5:58:54] pacificmc1: I wonder what you meant @Towelliee when you said 10.0 would be different. So far it seems like an ordinary exp from the leaks
[5:58:58] Saltytyphoon: oh what wall stollen
[5:59:02] Thoreya: why do so many people not think we can get a class...its been like 3 expansions lol
[5:59:04] Thoreya: and its 10.0
[5:59:06] mavericks312: oh its for sure non binary
[5:59:08] DeanoTV: @Towelliee if they make EVERYTHING account wide, people will be so happy guaranteed.
[5:59:09] Kisswani: @xfevers yes , because even if that's true , this is literally the only thing in the game
[5:59:11] Thoreya: its gotta be big
[5:59:11] burgerkingyo: let's hope we get more customization options D:
[5:59:13] lithium364: wups didnt know that doesnt show
[5:59:14] Orirholim: @weirdo_dude even if they were, they can always add in the other specs over 10.0 patch releases, it'd be fine
[5:59:22] invisiblematter: the gender thing is a troll surely
[5:59:26] RaysFTW: Magic, Dragons, time travel, civilized pandas, but a third gender is where chat starts questioning things?
[5:59:26] Dongtanian: maybe the new gender allows you choose between alpha and beta
[5:59:27] MaxedLuck_: so it's gender tinkerers? Pog
[5:59:29] Saltytyphoon: why I play dis
[5:59:31] 210Crawler: towHesaidit
[5:59:32] DragonofWolves: I mean if it's a new race then sure, genders for that race. nothing to lose your shit over lmao
[5:59:32] raye_gaming22: the new class better be that envoker and not a meele cant fitt that shit in a raid
[5:59:34] Yooosh_: @Towelliee do you prefer slands or bfa dungeons? 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[5:59:35] DeanoTV: think thats the biggest wish
[5:59:48] TheRukis: dude please make everything account wide..
[5:59:50] Nelyu: the shitstorm in the forum would be funny LUL
[5:59:55] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towStop towIt chat
[5:59:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, they could add more specs over time, but I think having only one spec is just a bad idea
[5:59:56] PipTown: currency/rep etc being account wide would be the ultimate alt firendlty move
[5:59:57] buddybeerbruh: Remember the days MMO's were not Political
[5:59:58] Rexialiton: bfa 100%
[5:59:59] KragnosWoW: atleast test it on the alpha
[6:00:01] Tjc222: BFA dungeons are waaaaaay better
[6:00:02] Saltytyphoon: its a combo
[6:00:02] nvnto: SL for me
[6:00:02] xFevers: @Kisswani Just shows they have no plan other then getting some virtue points
[6:00:04] fcwar_: Called out sick from work, I'm ready to go!
[6:00:05] mavericks312: S-lands 100%
[6:00:08] CowCook: i liked bfa dungeons more
[6:00:08] reggiepowa: there are good and bad in both but overall probably bfa
[6:00:09] Tharia: SL for sure
[6:00:10] ItsBorland: Mix of both for me
[6:00:11] mrz_as: @Tjc222 Kappa
[6:00:13] sragon13: you looking forward to season 4
[6:00:15] bukka_hot: yea ill take 2x legion dungeons thanks
[6:00:16] Kisswani: @xfevers no , just shows your iq tbh
[6:00:19] mavericks312: bfa dungeons were garbage
[6:00:20] iVukan: right now i do not play the game because many stuff i need to re-do on alts. if they were acc wide i would play WAY TOO MUCH wow cuz id play every single class/spec possible they just need to realise that they only benefit from making us play more and acc wide stuff will for sure make us play more
[6:00:23] Jokervenom1978: Tol dagor was broken.
[6:00:24] Saltytyphoon: lol
[6:00:28] reggiepowa: KEKW
[6:00:29] BoosGB: mmos arent political, people are
[6:00:30] cdk058: skip i think
[6:00:34] 無職提督: MDI pro
[6:00:36] nvnto: m+ route KEKW
[6:00:36] Adamantyum: @Towelliee if valor points are account bound should they be uncapped?
[6:00:43] 91Niki:  Just letting you guys know, this place is a safe place for anyone, no matter what you identify as. So if I see any toxic shit going on. I will ban you on the spot
[6:00:50] nvnto: ask him if he can share the route Kappa
[6:00:53] Saltytyphoon: midi tb-303 um sync
[6:00:53] Tharia: legion dungeons were def better. some raids too. though HFC wod was pretty great as well
[6:00:59] Kisswani: Niki monkaS 👍
[6:01:02] xFevers: @Kisswani LMAO ok buddy. I hope XIR have a great day Pepega
[6:01:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: If 75% of players only play DPS, then a single spec class is fine...but that doesn't help the game or dungeon queues, it makes them worse
[6:01:09] Tjc222: Thank you @91Niki
[6:01:10] mrz_as: monkaS
[6:01:12] Dongtanian: he got that dratnos route
[6:01:20] Collected1: 91Niki towHAMUP
[6:01:30] reggiepowa: uncapped would kill heroic raid loot too fast
[6:01:31] PurplePyrex: @91Niki purple189Love purple189Love purple189Love towLets towGo towRekt towByah
[6:01:34] PipTown: account bound or server bound currency hmm

[6:01:58] krealdawwg: cant imagine an expansion where we dont lvl up tbh xD
[6:02:10] lithium364: towLove
[6:02:12] lukeymoo: they seem to fill out the crap parts of a kit
[6:02:13] Orirholim: @precision79 sounds like a boring mmo
[6:02:14] mrz_as: KEWK
[6:02:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: A single-spec tank or healer class sounds okay to me, but few people would play it much
[6:02:51] shaaadeey: single specc  classes sounds good to me
[6:02:51] Banjo586: hunter pet pulled, kick him 󠀀 󠀀
[6:02:53] mrlunaplay: Feight death god tier spell
[6:02:56] Banjo586: and they kick someone else
[6:02:58] Meliea_EU: finally figured the reveal is 12pm EST 6pm CET
[6:02:59] geokouts: simple missdirect to healer and pull everything!
[6:03:13] Saltytyphoon: rane
[6:03:14] Donswag3: surprised you guys arent using invis pots
[6:03:17] burgerkingyo: u should try leveling in EU, this is how you're expected to play in normal
[6:03:21] lukeymoo: thats every normal dungeon for you; inevitably people wipe like 10 times trying to skip
[6:03:29] Im_a_sad_man: The skip fails 90% of the time and in the end up taking even more time LUL

[6:05:09] Lazugo: pre patch stuff
[6:05:09] Theduskflyer: where is this class leak?!?!?
[6:05:09] Banjo586: lets hope for 9.2.5
[6:05:10] Saltytyphoon: not legal timing
[6:05:12] raye_gaming22: preoder like DH
[6:05:13] Kisswani: @KragnosWoW Stiven is the datamining dude for wowhead
[6:05:16] Stonefather: That would be impressive.
[6:05:17] mmrghost7: god no
[6:05:22] mavericks312: that would be amazing
[6:05:22] reggiepowa: only 4 hours until we find out
[6:05:24] Clicklesly: 9.2.5 seems way too soon?
[6:05:26] graphicsfrog: @Towelliee thoughts on a murloc expansion?
[6:05:28] KragnosWoW: if dragons lay eggs does that make them birds or reptiles?
[6:05:29] LastYouSaw: Seems like its in 9.2.5 yeah
[6:05:30] Theduskflyer: WHY didnt we get allied races, thats a cool thing i wish they would keep up
[6:05:32] pavepawns: what we talking about now?

[6:05:38] Stonefather: @KragnosWoW Both
[6:05:40] Lazugo: pre patch stuff @Towelliee
[6:05:50] Saltytyphoon: wow
[6:05:54] coldhandsbeatz: Probably like DH. A couple of weeks before prepatch
[6:05:56] MortiousPrime: @KragnosWoW Reptiles because of everything involved with dragons, but they would likely fall into their own classification
[6:05:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: A new class in 9.2.5 would help keep the wait for 10.0 less boring
[6:05:57] heyldini: I have a concept, we have the dragonkids in The Nexus dungeon that are keeper/evoker abilities, the specs would be life keeper and time keeper, obviously switching the arcane abilities from mage to this new class and reworking arcane mage to arch-mage
[6:05:57] Kneckt: what if they make 9.2.5 pre pre patch
[6:06:02] Saltytyphoon: judge allowed
[6:06:04] Velirith: we will just get some backpack transmog and a mount for pre-order probably
[6:06:05] KragnosWoW: or are they dinosaurs?
[6:06:10] 210Crawler: We get to preorder today after the announcement?!
[6:06:11] dommgames98: 4 HOURS Pog
[6:06:12] burgerkingyo: imagine getting an ability that transforms u into a dragon, that'd be sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
[6:06:14] Kisswani: @Theduskflyer probably Shadowlands races didn't really allow for that
[6:06:21] precision79: @Orirholim i mean compared to options on retail even tbc sounds boring but that is not the case in my opinion :D
[6:06:30] coldhandsbeatz: DH was 10 days before prepatch I think
[6:06:30] pavepawns: did we get the bingo card rdy?
[6:06:34] Saltytyphoon: no the state voted
[6:06:44] Banjo586: class sounds pog, but the race looked goofy KEKW 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[6:06:49] mavericks312: whats better then dragons...dragon ppl
[6:06:51] Stonefather: I couldn't see getting a new class in 9.2.5 but that would indeed make the pain of waiting for 10.0 easier.
[6:06:55] BakedBeenz_: battle net shop goes down with weekly maitence, so maybe pre-order after reveal
[6:06:55] DragonofWolves: wait how is stiven already datamining shit wtf?
[6:06:58] jerseyfive: that goofy dragon race pictures are fake, no way blizzard made those LUL

[6:09:01] giggachadwar: Thats a cooldown like DH

[6:22:15] Jerry48038: Garrisons 2.0
[6:22:17] lithium364: Today my Brothers we walk into an Future thats free of Player retention metrics and coefficients of Fun.
[6:22:18] temp3st98: People wanted housing so much because so many players went to ffxiv
[6:22:20] Zandilar: housing? this late into the game, I doubt it.
[6:22:20] ILikeKillTheZombies: what will you do in that house
[6:22:20] tubbipack: @Towelliee do you feel like it'll have as much content as legion at launch?
[6:22:22] warrenny: And thats how players get disappointed
[6:22:23] Velirith: player housing is hard with the wow engine
[6:22:24] nvnto: I'd rather have hubs where you see everybody, instead of having your private housing
[6:22:26] kyoone07: yo @Towelliee ! when will the crossfaction stuff come out?
[6:22:26] Kisswani: He Knows POGGERS
[6:22:26] ttmaker: I don't want player hosuing
[6:22:28] FranciscoTheMage: I FEEL like Blizzard is SO TRAUMATIZED by Garrisons they will never do Housing for REAL.. @Towelliee
[6:22:29] Fensmarken: Also Ion said they wanted to make player housing didnt he?
[6:22:30] defuzz42: I dont really understand player housing
[6:22:30] Alaquane: Did dance studio ever happen?
[6:22:30] Collected1: housing as a mini phased area of dalaran would work
[6:22:31] elfihdy: what is player housing @Towelliee
[6:22:32] Zandilar: housing in ffxiv is savage.
[6:22:33] krealdawwg: please no housing :D dont make wow into runescape
[6:22:37] Ldysansa: God I hope not
[6:22:39] h_u_r_k_: why play wow, when you can play house.  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[6:22:43] rathmanis: Housing for 10.0, now more housing in 11.0
[6:22:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Guild housing, guild ships....something like that would be better, imo
[6:22:43] Moonori: don't care much for housing
[6:22:44] Aquadriel: fuck your dragons, give me Tinkers of Tinkeria exp
[6:22:46] dreamwalker213: What would player housing include in it in a WoW setting?
[6:22:49] undisputedmoe: plater ui!
[6:22:51] Taz_85: Wildstar housing was neat
[6:22:54] Saltytyphoon: tiny homes you build, fucked
[6:22:54] DwarfWarrior25: Guild Garrisons in a major city would be awsome to have
[6:22:57] Hexadecimal88: Ultima Online housing was the best
[6:23:01] skymercii: *cough FFXIV cough*
[6:23:03] Kisswani: @undisputedmoe !plater
[6:23:05] luravi: Ultima ONline still laffs at every other MMO for housing
[6:23:06] temp3st98: Kappa
[6:23:10] stokes_t: it was cool how other players could go in ur house in new world
[6:23:10] szble: dead world 󠀀
[6:23:13] MetalManGG: imagine house rent in WoW KEKW
[6:23:18] trashedskeletor: i dont want that new world rent on housing though lmfao
[6:23:26] undisputedmoe: !plater
[6:23:26] Moobot: @undisputedmoe Towelliee's Plater Addon Profile - https://wago.io/1ZozQnKxj
[6:23:29] Kisswani: whatever version of housing we get at least make it available to every one . no lottery bullshit
[6:23:30] ILikeKillTheZombies: affection system from lost ark Kappa
[6:23:34] Marc_ggnn: yeah
[6:23:39] gidgeet: Or even Lost Ark your stonghold has things for you to craft
[6:23:41] ItsEddieAU: give me housing in WoW, its the only house i'll ever be able to own PepeHands
[6:23:42] Decree34: wildstar housing was pretty crazy with what people came up with
[6:23:43] MarquisLek: its gonna be like secret bases in pokemon
[6:23:43] mulkon: Yeah for me Housing has to be a side effort. If I was to lose some big quest or some other cool activity just because of housing, I don't think its worth it particularly
[6:23:45] warrenny: @kisswani It
[6:23:48] cdk058: i would like it only if it doesnt mean a cash shop full of furniture
[6:23:48] cMakkaa: Anything that can hold it's own community is a good idea imo, that's why ff14 works so well to me
[6:23:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah we don't need taxes! lol
[6:23:50] Banjo586: put TAXES into the game 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[6:23:52] Epiclurker27893: Looking at what FFXIV is going through right now, housing needs to be unlimited if it's added.
[6:23:53] nickie6x: i would think guild housing would be kinda be cool, especially as a player housing compromise
[6:23:54] KragnosWoW: if they bring back housing i want it to persist through every expansion coming after, i dont like the idea of garrisons not being relevant anymore
[6:23:55] Aravarth: If they make personal housing such that you still have to go out into the world (not like Garrisons, where you could do all the professions and never leave), it would be great
[6:23:56] warrenny: @kisswani itll be bought with gold
[6:23:59] Zandilar: the lottery business with FFXIV is die to hardware limitations.
[6:23:59] kyoone07: yo @Towelliee ! when will the crossfaction stuff come out?
[6:23:59] Jokervenom1978: lol wow taxes
[6:24:01] h_u_r_k_: kill a boss get a desk lamp Pog
[6:24:03] ItsEddieAU: wildstar F
[6:24:04] Saltytyphoon: usa tills a volcano

[6:24:05] vanillahobbit: @mulkon true
[6:24:08] Collected1: i'm excited for Lore. he gets to share this moment on the other side.
[6:24:08] vadder_fister: w*ldstar
[6:24:09] arturiuss44: BDO has good housing, it is almost a mini-game for some and you can cook and do certain professions and also get buffs from it as well.
[6:24:11] deadlypinata: some type of longterm progression system would be nice instead of all borrowed power.
[6:24:19] Banjo586: no taxation without housination
[6:24:20] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[6:24:20] drunch85: saved the world several times over and still homeless Kappa
[6:24:21] Zandilar: crossfaction is going to be ace.
[6:24:23] lithium364: the fake ion twitter is going crazy aswell
[6:24:26] burgerkingyo: housing sounds cool in theory but in practice people would get bored of it in 2 days
[6:24:31] Technogre: why would people hype housing? we pretty much already had housing with garrisons and everyone hated it
[6:24:34] Kisswani: @warrenny yeah , to me like 50-500k gold for an instanced plot I'm fine with . gold cost linked to size
[6:24:36] EmperorFredd: And SWTOR has the guild flagship and player Strongholds as well
[6:24:37] ditaern: increased exp
[6:24:38] SinicalDev: I saw one leak saying theyre going to update the assets in EK/Kalimdor to be hi-res - which goes with those Stormwind assets that are in the game but not used
[6:24:39] Phae__: Give me a house that I can unlock portals to major cities in.
[6:24:42] shanerdog: WE LOVE YOU TOWELLIE|
[6:24:42] Aravarth: So like the zone improvements in WoD?
[6:24:44] flebbooo: ooh this cinematic Pog
[6:24:46] Zandilar: after Shadowlands, I just don't see how the faction conflict can be justified.
[6:24:50] buddybeerbruh: These leaks are intentional, I can tell just from the Javascript files that had the Dragonflight comments, as a developer who worked 10 years in the industry no company puts unminified JS files in their production servers @Towelliee
[6:24:51] laito_: just add housing but actually good 4Head
[6:24:58] iVukan: bring glyphs back and yeet conduit essence systems
[6:25:00] mrz_as: monkaS
[6:25:01] Collected1: Technogre : yeah but garrisons were done badly imho. housing should be one house in dalaran that you can customise
[6:25:02] ThePointGaming: yeah should just be worldwide/zone buffs
[6:25:02] MarquisLek: there will always be borrowed power nothing is permanent now
[6:25:02] Stonefather: Bwomsamdi PogChamp
[6:25:06] ThePawPaw: BOWSAMDI my mann
[6:25:08] Ziddrax: emmallamaPogShake
[6:25:09] Saltytyphoon: community, hate to say abuse of
[6:25:11] snaz94: bobsalami Pog
[6:25:12] gidgeet: I loved him
[6:25:12] cMakkaa: I'm curious what could be changed about endgame that would keep casual player retention but keep hardcore players interested as well
[6:25:16] Kisswani: POGGERS
[6:25:18] Nelyu: BOBSALAMI POGGERS
[6:25:18] jamechro: Just make this guy the new Khadgar
[6:25:25] Luxembourger: @laito_ we had housing? you mean Garisson?

[6:51:29] swordart2022: WH OMEGALUL
[6:51:30] Phae__: I miss Hemo rogues, but I doubt they're coming back

[6:52:16] Llamatude: Srv hunter is just called Forest Rogue..
[6:52:16] Schult2y: Player power needs to not be tied to player economy. Wasn’t biggest fan of that this expansion

[6:52:37] TeejayOCE: a good ask!
[6:52:39] Odinslayer: accout wide everything like lost ark
[6:52:39] xomegaprime: that would be cool but I'm just going to play one
[6:52:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Undead paladins would rock! lol
[6:52:41] Rookzs: It's truly annonying when games arent account wide
[6:52:42] xhale2nhale: bloodelf druids Inc today
[6:52:42] Velzenx: All addons if possible!
[6:52:47] NickLeonhearth: Account wide?! This guy is talking nonsense, quick dispatch the ninjas and take care of it
[6:52:47] martianxl: Do you think they will also add in more race class combos?  (Sorry if  I missed that comment.)
[6:52:47] blazeofhell: are they predictions though? you can't predict anything when you know devs and speak to them Kappa
[6:52:49] DiiscoViking: the gypsi wagon
[6:52:49] Thagrius: @Towelliee but the dev's had said they dont want that because some people love the alt grind
[6:52:50] Aquadriel: access deez
[6:52:50] lithium364: the forbidden word
[6:52:50] maxkule: SHARED REP PLEASE

[6:53:03] warrenny: Everything like ilvl? Bah
[6:53:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: dolly and dot are my best friends
[6:53:05] Norian45: Why are all the alied races still locked behind rep? Do you guys think thats good?
[6:53:05] warrenny: Nah
[6:53:08] RuggedRender: Im all for account stuff but I realy dont like how LA does it. Forcing alts is the other end of the shitty spectrum imo
[6:53:09] sarbapowa: aksesebiliti
[6:53:09] Coriollis: who do you think it will be the presenting face from Blizzard? Ion? Morgan? or someone neutral like a caster ?
[6:53:09] at1c: I just hope that there wont be any "rip cord" moment needed
[6:53:15] Velzenx: @Lintgamer Very serious. I loved the raiding in FF14. And hate the addons u need in WoW
[6:53:21] Ramdorpser: Dunno if we'll get all the details today - that would cover that.
[6:53:23] gfvaris: @Norian45 they arent just the achi
[6:53:27] borgking82: @Towelliee love a new tank class
[6:53:27] maxkule: @Norian45 They arent homie.
[6:53:28] xomegaprime: welcome to the land of degenerate
[6:53:28] visaeris412: remember wotlk survival with chimera shot and explosive shot, stacked armor pen until they took it out
[6:53:28] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee what about cross playing between servers like NA and EU?
[6:53:29] Capatchi: towVACBOSS
[6:53:31] Ldysansa: Everything yes everything
[6:53:34] hikaritd: I'd be ok if they remove this shitty lego upgrade systems and go back to Legion style: you just farm to upgrade
[6:53:34] ItsEddieAU: oo a fancy bird mount
[6:53:35] Lintgamer: You dont need them lol. Just dont install them
[6:53:38] xhale2nhale: @norian45 they're not
[6:53:42] MoChuLu: towLets towGo towHype towHype

[6:53:53] Findlyn: WTB 3rd DH spec
[6:53:54] MundiPlays: new healer maybe?
[6:53:54] ZakuzaGB: chronomancer healer/dps class
[6:53:54] Naturalbeef: @hikaritd Account wide means trying more classes and more time played
[6:53:55] Yagr6: shaman tank is the only one that makes sense
[6:53:58] s1lv102: the more we level up. the more weak we feel LMAO
[6:53:59] Alaquane: you'll never feel as strong as level 10 with heirlooms
[6:53:59] kets70: shit i forgot prot wars existed
[6:54:01] cappei: There's enough tanks. Time for a new healer and ranged/caster DPS class
[6:54:01] ickymonk: Needs a new Range class
[6:54:02] TwitchGurls: skirts r so much better than pants....accessibility
[6:54:02] JustAnAngryGamer: Do you have, or can you link your mod list plz, I see some i'd love to add to my own ui
[6:54:10] SocioPET: Do you think 3hrs from now the tension will become almost unbarable or still somewhat ok?
[6:54:10] 91Niki: !ui

[6:54:26] MrGharr: same
[6:54:26] gfvaris: a caster tank :
[6:54:27] Kisswani: that will be the biggest change to the game maybe ever
[6:54:27] Whiskey_Corin: Associated rumours with those dragon leaks were they they have 'push-and-hold' style abilities. Do you think that sounds fun?
[6:54:29] Rudric_Ice: so how many leaks have been out yet ?
[6:54:30] Rookzs: @Towelliee I'd probably try the game out again if it was account wide
[6:54:31] MortiousPrime: @NalinA Shaman tank would be dope
[6:54:31] NalinA: 4TH SPECS FOR NON DRUID CLASSES
[6:54:32] Kaype92: WITCH DOCTOR PLEASE
[6:54:33] LesterLinton: yes pls, everything i collect/gain on all my toons would be so nice
[6:54:33] MiddlePhaze: @Towelliee imagine if they take us to Azeroth but we have to re-unlock flying
[6:54:36] Phae__: @Findlyn Me too. That would be dope
[6:54:38] Jibbs280: bow using healer
[6:54:39] Khandak: @VELZENs tbf on ff14 you have giant colourfull arrows and markers for mechanics, wow is quite sublte
[6:54:40] ItsEddieAU: roster system in lost ark is great
[6:54:41] SocioPET: dual bow wielding class
[6:54:45] Kazgrax: Astromancer healer of the stars lol
[6:54:46] Yagr6: rogue that uses bow
[6:54:47] gergtrongaming: I have the same ask.
[6:54:48] Saltytyphoon: shamen tank points
[6:54:49] Collected1: my big ask is all classes for all races
[6:54:54] gergtrongaming: Total account wide wverything
[6:54:55] swordart2022: TIme to hdie chat again full on Pepega chat
[6:54:58] maxkule: @Towelliee Are we getting Aspect Power?
[6:55:00] avinater: an account wide bank would be nice
[6:55:00] Jibbs280: triple bow weilding class
[6:55:02] TheAngryGamerJoe: Mr Blizzard!!! Tear down this wall!
[6:55:03] MrGharr: next expac can contain anything, i don't care as long as everything is account wide.
[6:55:05] Angryfist40: convert a hunter class to Healer or tank?  lol

[6:55:12] nothumbgamer_ttv: @warrenny we even had a glyph to make us a semi tank was awesome
[6:55:14] Ldysansa: Be free and prosper
[6:55:18] Mitune: Shaman tank needs to happen in either retail or as a classic + thing for sure
[6:55:21] KragnosWoW: are there any shaman characters in lore that would seem like a tank?
[6:55:21] Deathc0re: what time are they announcing it, anyone know?
[6:55:21] Velzenx: @khandakk Exactly. So when they remove addons they can make fights better ingame. Instead of having to download addons. Imagine a new player coming to WoW. Wouldnt that be mucht better :)
[6:55:23] Llamatude: no more alts...
[6:55:24] Phae__: Give me more bank SPACE
[6:55:24] xhale2nhale: arrow in the heart to heal.ya
[6:55:26] cappei: Imagine introducing a dragon expansion and you won't be able to fly for an entire year for no reason while all the main characters fly around you. Yep, it's gonna happen OMEGALUL

[6:55:36] MrGharr: account wide rep
[6:55:37] Collected1: how about account wide guild

[6:55:42] Saltytyphoon: kinda agree with all abilty, classy
[6:55:43] Coriollis: acc wide tier sets Kappa
[6:55:43] JustAnAngryGamer: Have you watched the guy who is doing an Unreal Engine 5 version of different areas of WoW including Org?
[6:55:43] ThePawPaw: quest completed to skipp everything
[6:55:44] duffluv22: Cross faction guilds
[6:55:45] board4life65: account wide raid lockout?
[6:55:46] Malfleur: Accountwide bank ONLY if it is a 2nd bank... one charbound bank is nice I need this space
[6:55:47] Zavier420: I want to keep Pocopoc as at least a toy
[6:55:47] amricatt: Yes, please more account wide stuff.
[6:55:48] SinicalDev: account wide rep pls
[6:55:50] Rudric_Ice: account wide GOLD
[6:55:51] AinaTan3: what do you think about the Legacy system from SWTOR?
[6:55:51] MuttonChopins: I just want gear currency at least
[6:55:53] xhale2nhale: @deathc0re  prob around 11
[6:55:55] Jibbs280: 7 bow weilding class
[6:55:58] MrGharr: account level, account story progresss
[6:55:58] burgerkingyo: u make my pants tight every time u say account wide
[6:56:01] swordart2022: Never happening.
[6:56:01] 1337RAIDS: i hope they increase the level cap to 70. and provide us with Legendary weapons for this new exp.
[6:56:02] sarbapowa: acc wide gear
[6:56:02] xomegaprime: okay I think they know what the formula is don't worry
[6:56:07] kets70: they already announced communities
[6:56:10] kets70: being cross faction
[6:56:11] szble: sure they can 󠀀
[6:56:12] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee have you done a wishlist for 10.0?
[6:56:13] buddybeerbruh: You mean account wide even soulbound items ? @Towelliee
[6:56:13] classicfluffy: hey @Towelliee have you played elden ring? or plan to do so? :)
[6:56:16] Zandilar: acc wide crafting mats?
[6:56:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Outlaw guilds
[6:56:17] Saltytyphoon: lol we'll be here um
[6:56:18] mulkon: @Towelliee Do you think we will get a new class? We need a new Ranged dps ASAP, My raid right now is 80% melee :(
[6:56:18] Ldysansa: Tes
[6:56:25] TheCheeseWheel87: Account wide gold wouldnt work with different servers. that would ruin AH markets
[6:56:27] warrenny: What about gear? That would kill the need for alts @towelliee
[6:56:28] Aravarth: I def think that's the right idea. Before when you had like ONE main character (because of the time it took to level a 60 and get good, i.e., in Vanilla), your identity was tied to THAT CHARACTER. But it's not that anymore.
[6:56:31] Youredoneson666: Make it happen? its like 3 lines of code
[6:56:35] Thirrio: they cant story is different for each faction
[6:56:35] Aravarth: So let all the shit be account-wide.
[6:56:38] Frank4LuLz: world mercinary mode... all out pvp no factions
[6:56:40] Reckless_Monk: its just a string of commands.. its just code
[6:56:45] Odinslayer: !time
[6:56:45] Moobot: @Odinslayer Towelliee's time is currently 05:44:09 PST

[6:56:52] Saltytyphoon: took over stormwind love
[6:56:52] MrGharr: crossrealm AH
[6:56:53] Kisswani: LUL
[6:56:56] DrWatt: guilds will just become like communities really
[6:56:57] JustAnAngryGamer: His newest one iss an orc with duel wield Gorehowl and the sword in silithus, it looks amazing wish WoW was on Unreal5
[6:56:59] JackedDown: KEKW 󠀀 󠀀
[6:57:01] atamala: just code it bro
[6:57:03] flebbooo: 4Head just add it lol
[6:57:03] atamala: it's not hard
[6:57:04] Velzenx: Everything account wide.
[6:57:04] AinaTan3: 4Head Just type it down
[6:57:05] IianaDRK: armchair dev lol
[6:57:07] Reckless_Monk: It is
[6:57:08] Phae__: Tell me you don't code without telling me...
[6:57:09] cappei: I mean, the leaks did say a big UI rework was planned, so if that happens, it might be possible
[6:57:10] Soproatlol: but it is
[6:57:11] FannyPackGirl: just type it in blizz how hard can it be Kappa
[6:57:12] Reckless_Monk: the fuck?
[6:57:12] OceanManCarter: whats the point of being able to raid together if you can't then hang out together before/after
[6:57:12] TwitchGurls: imagine if account sharing became allowed OMG
[6:57:12] blazeofhell: 4Head
[6:57:13] 91Niki: @Reckless_Monk @Reckless_Monk Spotted the guy that knows ZERO about coding LUL
[6:57:13] luckfore: whats ur /played
[6:57:14] SinicalDev: it's not - a simple change and cause unforseen issues
[6:57:14] burgerkingyo: some private servers have crossfaction guilds
[6:57:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Killing the NPC's in peoples garrisons LUL
[6:57:20] Roccocco: I WANT CROSSFACTION GUILDSSSS
[6:57:22] JanCameraman: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:57:22] magemaster225: just dump it in UE5 ez
[6:57:25] aleksmetha: I leveld all classes before SL and after it never touched. So sad i would maybe still play and pay a sub if i could enjoy other classes
[6:57:25] UnholyLP: just do it 󠀀 󠀀
[6:57:26] Collected1: how difficult can it be
[6:57:26] ItsEddieAU: code deez...
[6:57:27] literally_human_garbage: Just code it, football head!
[6:57:27] crixx123: any big predictions for the expansion reveal bro?
[6:57:27] Collected1: multi dollar company
[6:57:28] Reckless_Monk: "Classic cant be done"
[6:57:28] Saltytyphoon: like century
[6:57:31] trikah: They addressed all that on wow head about the cross faction thing
[6:57:31] mulkon: @Towelliee Do you think we will get a new class?
[6:57:31] HaloS23: @Towelliee I seem to remeber some rumor about time flow is different in Shadowlands vs. Azeroth. Think there will be something about that or am I off?
[6:57:33] Nenio_420: lol @LilAlakazam
[6:57:33] Phae__: Guys just pull it off Git
[6:57:34] aribellae: Increase the reagent bank size 10x and make it account wide, please
[6:57:35] Reckless_Monk: omg look it was done
[6:57:35] Akuka_: Cross faction is apparently a single line of code but adding guilds in really fucks with it
[6:57:37] Myplague__: is private server can do it blizz can
[6:57:44] pavepawns: just codedededed it 5head
[6:57:44] Theduskflyer: I hope they get rid of Weakauras kappa
[6:57:46] Rookzs: I feel like wow  has ability bloat too
[6:57:47] Youredoneson666: Almost every private server has cross faction everything. if they can figure it out i'm sure blizz can
[6:57:47] gfvaris: if a russian in his basement can do cross faction guild blizz surely can do it
[6:57:48] QuigsTV: just git gud Blizz LUL @Towelliee
[6:57:49] Kambien: Factions sit behind legacy code. But, they could do it like Everquest. Where everyone can join a guild but you can’t enter certain cities. That works amazing.
[6:57:53] Mistery836: what's wrong with that? I do it all the time Kappa
[6:57:54] Zephic: Zephic subscribed with Prime. 
[6:57:59] Saltytyphoon: lol private, never

[6:58:10] flebbooo: nooo LUL
[6:58:10] Yagr6: with covenants they do
[6:58:11] crixx123: Game going community based rather than guild maybe?
[6:58:12] Dirtnose: Just cause private servers have done it doesnt mean its just as easy. They're different code bases entirely lol
[6:58:15] bazziiiTV: haha ability bloat. go play ff14 dude
[6:58:15] xomegaprime: I agree EverQuest did a lot of things right
[6:58:15] cappei: Look at fucking Fury Warriors and say that again
[6:58:15] MetalexZero: less bloat than it used to have
[6:58:16] Mitune: Clearly not a MoP player for sure
[6:58:17] Vexxsis: triggered chat inc
[6:58:18] Mistery836: nah. WoW used to have ability bloat though.
[6:58:21] Mistery836: but not anymore
[6:58:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: We've been pruned and then they de-pruned
[6:58:29] Waiden01: After playing Lost Ark for quite some time now I can not enjoy WoW combat anymore :/
[6:58:29] TAYLOR_HAM: DH main trust me not a ability bloat lol
[6:58:34] s1lv102: i would say, i want fly just for gold. no achievement or whatever.
[6:58:34] Roccocco: TRUE
[6:58:34] Rooseweld: I want atleast 7 more abilities per class
[6:58:42] DovahChicken: @Cappaie  whats with fury warrior?   there is like 3 buttons to press
[6:58:45] jax_hammer_: can we please just get OGRES 🙏
[6:58:47] Frank4LuLz: 4 to many
[6:58:49] ThatsProto: There is ability bloat
[6:58:49] Saltytyphoon: grid healing
[6:58:49] Rookzs: Thats ability bloat
[6:58:49] Mitune: DH is the opposite KEKW
[6:58:50] Coriollis: well everyone has cc , escape, idk the only 2 things that separate is on single target and aoe
[6:58:51] MortiousPrime: FFXIV has that problem with way too many buttons
[6:58:51] Rookzs: lol
[6:58:52] cappei: @DovahChicken Yeah, exactly
[6:58:55] ar_melol: there are too many utility abilities. not enough fun abilities to make classes unique and so called "fun buttons" anymore
[6:58:56] kamikazis: more class trial options, would be nice... if I wanna try a tank or a healee...
[6:58:56] zerkx1: I acutally want more buttons to hit. i legit believe and think that WoW has too little buttons
[6:58:59] ThatsProto: A bunch of abilities are useless though
[6:59:00] Reckless_Monk: people seriously think its impossoble. like there isnt code and options in that code they put just in case they want to open up factions.. lol
[6:59:03] JoeCocomo: I think utility is becoming bloat... more action spells and less utility
[6:59:04] crixx123: simplified classes on harder raid content
[6:59:08] TheAngryGamerJoe: DH healing spec when
[6:59:09] MortiousPrime: Oh gods, yeah, SWTOR is bad with it
[6:59:10] amricatt: Definitely utility bloat.  Some of them I don't even pull out of the spell book.
[6:59:14] Spathotan: FF14 is ability bloat too
[6:59:18] Dirtnose: 7.0 gutted SWTORs abilitys
[6:59:21] MrGharr: I also hope for a good talent rework, where every talent is viable.
[6:59:22] Spathotan: My samurai has like 4 full bars
[6:59:23] Odinslayer: so the pruning was justified
[6:59:24] Saltytyphoon: new how far, debuffs, and hots
[6:59:24] ThatsProto: 8 action spells is a sweet spot
[6:59:25] ILikeKillTheZombies: utility bloat i agree
[6:59:25] krealdawwg: WoW Classic using dif ranks xD
[6:59:29] luckfore: has a official presentation slide ever leaked before? i think all we saw was fake
[6:59:30] UnholyLP: and ffxiv is on console aswell 󠀀 󠀀
[6:59:31] lithium364: that new race looks like that rat from the movie braindead
[6:59:31] SocioPET: Is it possible to become the best healer on the server fast in the new xpac if you haven't played the last few xpacs alot?
[6:59:32] IianaDRK: some classes in 14 have barely any abilities. my dancer doesnt even fill 2 bars
[6:59:33] the_keldor: Damn, you had to mention SWTOR...time to reinstall it
[6:59:36] xomegaprime: a force choke would be cool
[6:59:38] 91Niki: @Reckless_Monk Nobody ever said it was impossible. But it isn't as simple as JUST doing it.
[6:59:38] Dracarys_021: I was using keybinds i never used before in FF compared to WoW @Towelliee
[6:59:42] jerseyfive: thats why hunter does the extra mechanics in raids :)
[6:59:45] MortiousPrime: @the_keldor I wouldn't
[6:59:48] Saltytyphoon: k god sorry
[6:59:51] havenbirch: Think 10.0 will include Quel'thalas and Lordaeron?
[6:59:59] temp3st98: wow is childs play compared to ffxiv
[6:59:59] Mitune: I think in ff14 they might make combos like they have them in the new pvp mode
[7:00:01] flebbooo: Idk, i prefer it like it is right now. We already have lots to focus on in raids/mechanics overall, would just be stressful
[7:00:02] Mistery836: weird. I don't feel that problem with ff14. but maybe it's because I play controller and it feels more smooth that way?
[7:00:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, DK has a kind of force choke with strangulate
[7:00:06] xhale2nhale: they decreased it remember so specs have less buttons. wow did have alot of buttons b4
[7:00:08] aleksmetha: I hope they scrap the talent system complete and redo it so its fresh :)
[7:00:09] Odinslayer: that cause of pruning 100% @Towelliee
[7:00:12] Serjj991: @Towelliee  do you think we will ever get housing?
[7:00:15] LBCBOMBERMAN: eta to announcement?
[7:00:22] Saltytyphoon: line of sight
[7:00:22] IianaDRK: the retaking of deatholme points towards eversong not being an instance anymore
[7:00:24] Thirrio: what time is the announcement?
[7:00:28] xomegaprime: I think simple is good to get the messages to come
[7:00:33] MrGharr: I think they should give us more choice of abilities, but limit us on the number we can have at the same time.
[7:00:35] MortiousPrime: @LBCBOMBERMAN See the bigass timer above Towelliee?
[7:00:38] SocioPET: @LBCBOMBERMAN read screen
[7:00:39] Odinslayer: @Thirrio in 3 hours
[7:00:39] cerealkillas22: I bet they give demonology warlock a rework this expansion
[7:00:40] falldrgn: where was tha talent tree linked?
[7:00:44] Maawulo: @Thirrio 3h 12min left
[7:00:44] zerkx1: if you want to see real ability bloat go play ff11. there is a reason why it's a menu based combat game
[7:00:46] MrGharr: kind of like pvp talents.
[7:00:46] PurplePyrex: @Thirrio little over 3 hours
[7:00:47] Dongtanian: one of my boys plays sam on a controller. absolute mad one. tbf he pumps hard
[7:00:49] PurplePyrex: its on screen
[7:00:50] Thirrio: ty
[7:00:54] LBCBOMBERMAN: LOL im blind ty
[7:00:58] IianaDRK: just give me dark ranger as a class pls
[7:00:58] Rudric_Ice: i don't want to hit 100 buttons to play my class i hate that shit
[7:01:02] Youredoneson666: can someone whisp me or post w\e talent leak hes talking about
[7:01:05] Thirrio: haha yea me too blind
[7:01:12] Saltytyphoon: sucked at pvp not that
[7:01:26] 91Niki: @Youredoneson666 https://imgur.com/a/zGx83Td
[7:01:26] SocioPET: It would be cool if someone gifted 100 subs
[7:01:27] Kirrimir: One of my real hopes for this next expansion is to make leveling alts optional, i know blizzard wont go for it as they sell character boosts but i can dream
[7:01:30] thezhulfaqar: can anyone confirm that we will get a second catalyst stack if we didnt craft a tier item this week?
[7:01:32] IianaDRK: dude if that talent tree is true im going to be super excited
[7:01:37] luckfore: dead game btw
[7:01:38] MidnightSo: With all these things, it's all about achieving a healthy balance
[7:01:41] literally_human_garbage: what if they gave us something like that leaked screenshot and then we had the ability to save builds? like i could have a world content build, raid build, pvp build, but all talent set ups
[7:01:42] Aidler: I mean, if there is a expansion to rework everything or a lot 10.0 would be it…

[7:01:50] AudioTronic: i play wow since legon and i have no clue what 90% of the classes do in wow. I think for new player its hard to understand whats happening
[7:01:53] xhale2nhale: gonna miss Wild Spirit next xpac,  wish it was a nice volley replacement

[7:02:55] cappei: At all
[7:02:57] cdk058: looks good af
[7:03:00] IianaDRK: the concept of a separate class talent tree is really cool
[7:03:01] deckardblade: no way its fake
[7:03:01] Odinslayer: @jure__ as in class points and spec points
[7:03:02] thezhulfaqar: i made it :)
[7:03:04] laito_: OH NO CONVOKE Sadge
[7:03:04] Saltytyphoon: yum
[7:03:04] 91Niki: @Towelliee It looks like a mix between talents, abilities and covenant perks
[7:03:06] Youredoneson666: It looks legit
[7:03:08] dillapuss: Could be a private server thing
[7:03:08] blazeofhell: 5Head
[7:03:10] jax_hammer_: I'm still waiting on ogres since the April fools in 2004
[7:03:12] luckfore: looks like something BLizz would make
[7:03:12] 91Niki: I see covenant perks in there
[7:03:12] davrosdk: I somehow doubt they will go back to talent trees
[7:03:15] bazziiiTV: looks like a early version of the talent tree is it could be, if they didnt revamp it into talent rows

[7:03:18] Norian45: If this is true then  thats fucking big for me
[7:03:21] Todmeister9000: what's even the point of this when everyone will just follow what wowhead says to pick
[7:03:26] Theduskflyer: 6795% fake. No way they go to that crazy shit, after saying why they got away from the big talent trees
[7:03:28] Saltytyphoon: why limited
[7:03:29] Naturalbeef: Why would it be confirmed?
[7:03:30] UnholyLP: convoke is in there 󠀀 󠀀
[7:03:31] xhale2nhale: we'll find out today
[7:03:35] mavericks312: if they do talent trees i fully expected cov perks to be added
[7:03:35] jure__: @Odinslayer hm, that is actually a good idea
[7:03:36] IianaDRK: theres no way r druid isnt getting convoke baseline
[7:03:36] Odinslayer: i think these will be conduits and soulbinds combined stuff
[7:03:37] duffluv22: Hey...Still l9oks good
[7:03:40] FannyPackGirl: would love to keep some cov abilities
[7:03:41] gfvaris: there are shadowlands and bfa private servers :D
[7:03:41] Thoreya: ion like confirmed convoke is gonna be for druids after SL
[7:03:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think that does look too complex to be real
[7:03:47] cerealkillas22: this talent thing is soooo fake
[7:03:48] Toradin: i love old talents backgrounds
[7:03:50] Norian45: aslong as u dont have to pay 50g each time u want to respec!

[7:04:01] Saltytyphoon: tried mac for sec
[7:04:06] yajje: Do you think Blizz will shutdown Warmane private server when they release / announce WOTLK Classic? @Towelliee
[7:04:08] Mike__Ro: this looks like poe lul
[7:04:12] xFevers: I love convoke
[7:04:16] Rataplany: abomination limbs are really cool also
[7:04:18] jerseyfive: paladin without the kyrian ability just feels wrong now
[7:04:18] amricatt: I really like this idea.
[7:04:21] AWreal: I'm a little dissapointed. I expected to see towelliee in an Alexstrazsa cosplay

[7:04:40] Kaydwen: link?
[7:04:40] Mitune: This looks cool I hope that it has more potential for builds and less cookie cutter but that is OMEGA Copium
[7:04:42] Korupcija_: this would only be fun if we level 1-60 again, unless it's AP again
[7:04:44] Kneckt: @Towelliee https://imgur.com/WQMEAGG another version
[7:04:44] NiteLancer: hopefully it's not a nightmare to balance
[7:04:45] JackedDown: The numbers mason 󠀀 󠀀

[7:04:55] imAskja: Wait I just joined. What is this?
[7:04:58] Ansirox: Everyone squished to level 30
[7:05:00] Templexx: dont think ive seen this pic yet
[7:05:01] Mistery836: or you won't get points the first 10 levels
[7:05:02] vanillahobbit: 10 none 60 points level 70
[7:05:05] MuttonChopins: I hoope they dont increase the level cap to 70 and just do the story for questing
[7:05:05] Youredoneson666: @laito_ you think its not cool? KEKW
[7:05:06] Mistery836: so 10-70
[7:05:06] xhale2nhale: It reminds me of Horizon Forbidden West talent Tree system
[7:05:08] s1lv102: lvl 10 + 60 points. lvl 70
[7:05:09] trikah: What is this?
[7:05:11] xomegaprime: Tomatoes looks good the more it looks like Path of Exile the better
[7:05:13] Theduskflyer: So we aren’t leveling up? Just staying 60?
[7:05:13] cerealkillas22: this be so fake
[7:05:18] amricatt: It would allow us to customize our character more.  I don't think that's a bad idea.
[7:05:18] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @tomaskan01 (warning)

[7:05:31] Ortinoth: these new updated trees?
[7:05:32] fewyn: points 10-70?
[7:05:34] Saltytyphoon: ya love makeup
[7:05:39] ArcaneSyntax: 60 points makes sense if it's 10-70 now
[7:05:40] pavepawns: unless this isnt a talent tree but its our covenant tree?
[7:05:42] t0pgun_: balancing this would be a nightmare
[7:05:43] Mistery836: idk. that is a lot of systems to throw to a new player.
[7:05:49] xomegaprime: sorry I said Tomatoes I meant to me it's text-to-speech
[7:05:52] Silverwards: why does it take up the whole screen? this isn't meant to be from in game right? or just for demo/presentation purposes?
[7:05:52] Lothawia: just bring back wotlk talent trees ez
[7:05:53] Rataplany: are there any images of the evoker class?
[7:05:53] luckfore: "leakers" really have improved their photoshopping skills since SL leak season
[7:05:56] aleksmetha: How long will the presentation last in ur opinion?
[7:05:57] Norian45: How about the two abilities on the left side of the trees? @Towelliee aka nature swiftness and tranquility
[7:05:57] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @Mazkon
[7:05:58] Kisswani: I understand leveling isn't what it sued to be , but I still would like to have a level increase none the less tbh
[7:05:59] steldam: I wish this true!!!
[7:06:03] SuperN1: in vanilla you didnt get talent points until lvl 10. So do you think next expack will be lvl 70 or still 60 @Towelliee
[7:06:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Maybe it was something worked on, but I can't see this being in the game
[7:06:06] luckfore: LUL
[7:06:06] Stonefather: Discord leaks PogChamp
[7:06:07] mavericks312: a disgruntled dev on disc
[7:06:08] jerseyfive: ofc is fake
[7:06:08] atowellthatiallreadyused: found on reddit too
[7:06:09] luckfore: that says enough
[7:06:12] hestar: Graphic designers with too much time on their hands... Kappa
[7:06:12] IianaDRK: @Towelliee thoughts on the weird dragon people "leaked" race?
[7:06:13] einself111: Source "Trust me Bro" LUL
[7:06:14] Mazkon: wtf is with moobot
[7:06:16] Ortinoth: i wouldn't mind seeing talent trees again tbh @Towelliee
[7:06:17] Odinslayer: @Towelliee you think we will have a preorder today?
[7:06:19] zarod89: all your spells in the talent tree
[7:06:19] cerealkillas22: this looks like the fan made talent stuff from wowhead a few months ago
[7:06:20] literally_human_garbage: fake or not, it's an idea i could get behind. if it is fake, i'm not upset that isn't not real, though
[7:06:21] avinater: my pproblem is the background makes no sense
[7:06:22] stratiss: so it seems like they moved every core ability to a talent choice, i wonder what the base class gets ability wise
[7:06:32] venom366: he knows Kappa
[7:06:34] fewyn: i'm 100% of this revamped talent system
[7:06:35] xhale2nhale: gotta admit it looks good either  way
[7:06:35] MuttonChopins: have you seen the crappy dragon race KEKW
[7:06:36] pavepawns: it looks like conduit+artifact
[7:06:38] FranciscoTheMage: disgruntled dev?
[7:06:40] Saltytyphoon: ty burning
[7:06:42] TheCheeseWheel87: New World Tree
[7:06:44] Antdavs24: Source: yes SeemsGood
[7:06:45] vanillahobbit: true
[7:06:45] KaisenSiru: YEP
[7:06:47] Chiraakitteh: But man, changing your points within your spec will be a pita, compared the few simple clicks now
[7:06:49] zarod89: looks like a slide
[7:06:49] cappei: So many people saying this is fake. Bet ya'll were the same people saying Bolvar was fucking fake because of his eye glow KEKW
[7:06:49] MMokuin: yep
[7:06:49] flebbooo: YEP
[7:06:51] mrz_as: YES
[7:06:51] s1lv102: i have a theory on blizzard's games. if it looks good, it probably fake
[7:06:55] ZakuzaGB: my problem is why is convoke the spirits in it? @Towelliee
[7:06:55] fewyn: true but having options
[7:06:55] FranciscoTheMage: it does look like conduits
[7:06:56] Stonefather: It's an illusion of choice but it looks cool.
[7:06:57] Ortinoth: there will always be a meta
[7:07:01] AinaTan3: But it's fun
[7:07:04] fewyn: you don't have to be optimal
[7:07:05] Kisswani: Shouldn't stop you from changing it tho .
[7:07:08] Saltytyphoon: ?
[7:07:08] xomegaprime: new builds is very fun
[7:07:09] IianaDRK: theres no way to make a "choice" with any form of talents
[7:07:09] bd09live: Its the same in PoE to
[7:07:11] fooxytv: holy shit what's this?
[7:07:12] laito_: @Youredoneson666 I mean, I can see why ppl like it but its just a rng fiesta ability it cant be unique imo
[7:07:16] fooxytv: leak images?
[7:07:16] tino49: nope, talent trees are su much better than what we have now
[7:07:19] atamala: I think if there are so many, it creates a lot of off meta builds that could be competitive
[7:07:20] Fazion: Not everyone is interested in 'being the best' though
[7:07:22] feherlofia123: theyve had years now of taking what works with classic and to imolement it into retail, so talent trees ? why not
[7:07:23] Bulgogiprince: Bulgogiprince subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Lets hope for some good info today. This will be a great day.
[7:07:24] xomegaprime: it lets you touch them
[7:07:25] maalow: but whatever the talent system you have you can't evade the cookie-cutter builds
[7:07:25] MetaKuron: Make talent trees private?
[7:07:26] IianaDRK: this is far far better than the existing system imo
[7:07:27] Lothawia: Source: my friends dad works at blizzard LUL
[7:07:27] Phae__: Yeah, but who cares about that, honestly? You'll want your character to be the most powerful. The issue is with how many different UIs there are now to change conduits, soulbinds, talents, pvp talents, etc., etc...
[7:07:29] RuggedRender: no way around it considering the game doesnt have action combat imo
[7:07:34] aleksmetha: How long will the presentation last in ur opinion?
[7:07:35] ground4isu: There currently is a bunch of us used talents.
[7:07:36] trikah: What is this thing?
[7:07:38] JackedDown: We're predictable Sadge 󠀀 󠀀
[7:07:38] xhale2nhale: Every hunter going Azorthorian way
[7:07:42] AltChillUP_: Fukk yea
[7:07:42] Lystme: could league system work ?
[7:07:42] Kisswani: even if you have to change depending on content , that's still an extra level of customization
[7:07:47] Relic7: The existing talent system is bad. Not enough choice.
[7:07:48] jerseyfive: everything you see 1 day berofe the announcement is 100% fake
[7:07:51] Araphas: It's satisfying to get points to spend when leveling
[7:07:51] fkinthiccbro: YES FUCKING THANK YOU BLIZZARD
[7:07:53] Gravelode: IS THIS THE NEW TREE POG :o
[7:07:54] DovahChicken: still looks cool  i mean arifact weapons have all same but it was stil a fun progress tree
[7:07:55] Saltytyphoon: always not yours
[7:07:55] Yagr6: thats blizzards fault for not shaking up the meta
[7:07:56] zerkx1: that doesn't matter Toweliee. just because there is 1 optimal route it doesn't mean you should remove players the option to get creative
[7:07:56] 91Niki: Calm the caps guys
[7:07:58] akaasti: If they did a  talent system they need to remove the power gain from it and just make it change how the abilities look
[7:07:58] zarod89: bissss
[7:07:59] cappei: The current talent tree is the most boring shit ever. Will this give any more variety? Probably not, but I'd rather see than doing something than staying with the same boring stuff after 10 years
[7:07:59] Keirmot: we already all spec the same way, this will give it a new look
[7:07:59] Norian45: It gives more depth. and that is good
[7:08:00] doomester: @Towelliee what do you suggest for talents?
[7:08:00] AWreal: The ideal tree has a cookie cutter option that is best in most situations but has options for specific situations that allow players to use their brains
[7:08:00] Aquadriel: shit still cookie clutter
[7:08:02] ILikeKillTheZombies: theres new leak
[7:08:03] gooni_coyg: @Relic7 all take the same build.. what choice u want
[7:08:04] bob2305: there's always gonna be a meta
[7:08:05] xFevers: The current talent system is the same thong though
[7:08:05] brewgamingtv: yeah still going to be a cookie cutter for max dps
[7:08:06] Akermay: Feeling called out right now :D
[7:08:07] Blvdman: lol
[7:08:08] simon8x: I m still happy to see this
[7:08:09] Odinslayer: like we do now, i didn't touch too many talents like crusade on my ret paladin since the launch of shadowlands LUL
[7:08:09] JackHealMe: I think it will give more options for different raid bosses etc
[7:08:10] Erielle04: Can I post the updated one?
[7:08:11] mavericks312: always been like that
[7:08:12] Tausgi: but thats every game. Theres always the best build
[7:08:12] Pippinn: if they have actual choice in a thing like this. it'll be sick
[7:08:14] lastdeo: I won't, because I will suck anyways
[7:08:15] ZeusDNA: Santa?!
[7:08:15] akaasti: They really need to go back to basics
[7:08:15] ZakuzaGB: christmas PogChamp

[7:08:24] Lystme: what if we have a talent system common to ALL classes ?
[7:08:28] 91Niki: Christmas expansion confirmed POGGERS
[7:08:29] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @fallenxgabe (warning)
[7:08:29] einself111: There were some fun non meta builds back then
[7:08:29] Sielu11628: New leak image

[7:08:58] literally_human_garbage: artifact weapons were something new that felt a bit old school
[7:09:01] coffeelover29: woah thats a cool xp bar what addon is that?
[7:09:01] xFevers: itll aalways be that way no matter what though
[7:09:04] Mistery836: if only builds didn't matter and it would just add some wacky fun stuff outside of mythic dungeons/raids. like for open world stuff LUL
[7:09:05] Norian45: It would be so cool if you can have like 5 pages of talent trees so u can swap between the 5 of them
[7:09:06] DiiscoViking: i would like disc priest to smack again
[7:09:08] Sielu11628: New image on MMOc

[7:13:22] Saltytyphoon: only farm lik
[7:13:22] Stonefather: I'm pretty sure we aren't going to like the chicken dragon.
[7:13:23] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee i hope they change the sandworn relics soon i have like 2000 in my mains bag
[7:13:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The raids will be good, the dungeons probably good, too, I agree

[7:13:41] bchris13: they'd build a lot of good will with account wide everything
[7:13:44] aleksmetha: Acc wide would be so good. Wheres no reason to dont do it
[7:13:46] Bulgogiprince: account wide everything would perfect
[7:13:48] xomegaprime: I will make the chicken Dragon my first made
[7:13:50] Manyfist: Maybe they could start collapsing servers.
[7:13:50] Bulgogiprince: Resub automatic
[7:13:53] Llamatude: make them account bound..
[7:13:56] Mightyfx: Mightyfx subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:13:58] sarbapowa: what are those relics used for?
[7:13:58] FannyPackGirl: they should let us buy sockets with sandworn relics and call it a day
[7:13:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Swagasarus rep, currency, zone progression is not
[7:14:01] ZealotryTV: that and the conduit upgrade things
[7:14:08] sarbapowa: I have plenty
[7:14:09] FranciscoTheMage: ZM is done.
[7:14:09] yanansmootlol: Wait how do i get to vol'dun
[7:14:11] Diofael: @Bulgogiprince TRUEEEE
[7:14:12] Samurai3434: can you use any of the Zerith gear to craft a tier piece?
[7:14:13] Novirtue_: sanworm relics can at least be converted into tier gear if you're that desperate for one piece SeemsGood
[7:14:14] FranciscoTheMage: they aint looking back
[7:14:16] Nejba: Imagine the reveal not being dragonflight lol people would be so pissed
[7:14:16] kiwifruit56: can you tell them in the super duper secret discord that outlaw needs some love, pretty please <3
[7:14:22] Phae__: Just a little bit of code, man
[7:14:24] Ortinoth: @Samurai3434 no

[7:14:30] Kinghorn: I have not touched ZM since I hit exalted 󠀀 󠀀
[7:14:33] Lothawia: Chat do you think they will talk about Wotlk also today or hard pass?
[7:14:33] MrGharr: I think they have still time to do "account wide everything" even if they haven't started working on it.
[7:14:35] markymarkz1: it would be nice to unlock transmog on my priest for my warrior etc
[7:14:35] bobmcfob: @towelliee I found your older doppelgänger on Netflix. Unless your secretly on a cooking show we dont know about lol
[7:14:35] tsktsk: It’s such an easy change too. Just change it to account bind and boom, everyone happy
[7:14:41] IianaDRK: another player pog
[7:14:41] Ziddrax: dont even need new code for all account wide just copy from other :D

[7:15:14] Korupcija_: a real player wtf D:
[7:15:15] yanansmootlol: I think they might increase the level cap to 70
[7:15:20] Saltytyphoon: spriest main, newb now
[7:15:24] pseudomenudo: haven't played since 9.0 and can't find a mega list of changes since
[7:15:25] Naturalbeef: They should be able to make Sandworn Relics BoA fairly easy
[7:15:34] Tiikiibob: Whats up @Towelliee you smexy stud you!
[7:15:36] Kinghorn: jesse we have to cook! 󠀀 󠀀
[7:15:38] Ashbuu: yoooo a surv hunter, my favorite! how are you liking it?
[7:15:41] Malfleur: I hope they RESET us to Level ^^
[7:15:42] phiil__: That big of an eater though
[7:15:44] XanaGear: Yo towelliee it's Nekrosiss from S e v e n and FTR back in the day...excited to watch the expansion reveal with you  xanaPog
[7:15:45] mmrghost7: nooo i want 70
[7:15:46] Mistery836: I want a sword and shield DPS class. I know it sounds weird. I just want a sword and shield without responsibility KEKW
[7:15:48] ThePointGaming: even 65 would be okay
[7:15:49] Malfleur: level 1
[7:15:50] mmrghost7: i hate stayong at same level
[7:15:51] ArcaneSyntax: that's giga copium
[7:15:51] LordOverflow_II: LordOverflow_II subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 116 months! 3 more freaking hours to go... HAMMERS UP!!! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:15:52] Kisswani: I dont know man . I kinda like having a higher level
[7:15:53] Verdigo__: I'd love to stay at 60
[7:15:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would be fine with 70, but the leveling isn't really needed for progression
[7:15:54] AltChillUP_: TRUE
[7:15:54] senseofpurpose90: i want 70
[7:15:55] jure__: imagine if there was no leveling for the first time ever in a new expansion
[7:15:55] brewgamingtv: let's be honest u haven't really gain power from leveling
[7:15:56] mavericks312: i think there is a level increase cause to many players would bitch otherwise
[7:15:57] Rev_Furyas: i wanna stay 60, i'm tired of the " lvl squishes "
[7:15:57] zerkx1: Toweliee is secret chef ramnsey jr? pepeD
[7:15:58] Diofael: Roster XP instead KEKW ?
[7:15:58] bazziiiTV: will never happen. what ppl do the first 1-2 days
[7:15:59] Wasabix1: nope we're going to 80 to keep it even with wrath classic lol
[7:15:59] Ortinoth: i really hope no more leveling - cuz if they make us level again I want all my 120s bac
[7:16:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: dragon levels
[7:16:02] AltChillUP_: FUCK LVLING
[7:16:05] Saltytyphoon: yup one at a time
[7:16:06] Collected1: the cap has to stay at 60 to make chromie time still viable
[7:16:11] aminus: theres not much point in adding levels. The game is locked behind the story anyway that gets you to max level. So, you can just do the exact same thing but not tie level to it
[7:16:12] mmrghost7: staying at same level is so frustrating
[7:16:12] JamesBtw: Will a new class be revealed today maybe?
[7:16:13] stoke: gw2 Kappa
[7:16:13] senseofpurpose90: i love leveling
[7:16:14] Finsby_: I don't mind getting level 70
[7:16:20] Mostdangspy: I am playing one now. Guild Wars 2 does a good job of that
[7:16:21] Alaquane: slootI slootCopium
[7:16:23] CritcobainTV: Riiich
[7:16:23] MrGharr: add paragon levels
[7:16:24] Griffo525: i want 70, i love the fresh expansion leveling
[7:16:25] brewgamingtv: in like 3 xpac we'd be right back to a level squish if they did leveling
[7:16:28] MrGharr: or add account level
[7:16:29] Bayless_TV: @towelliee Have you stayed mostly leak free or have you been looking at them??
[7:16:34] Tiikiibob: You still playing lost ark much?
[7:16:35] aleksmetha: The level number ist kinda useless if ur under max level
[7:16:38] ChrisarN: why bother balancing classes in 9.2.5 if 10.0 is going to shake up everything?  @towelliee
[7:16:40] senseofpurpose90: @brewgamingtv and thats fine
[7:16:41] Saltytyphoon: when plasma tvs oh sony
[7:16:44] RealWhiski: Maybe lower everyone to 50 and then go 60 again?
[7:16:46] blazeofhell: go f2p and introduce softcap system so that 60 is softcap that gets pushed by patches
[7:16:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: lost ark is putting a trailer out today for the thursday update
[7:16:55] ContraRob: IS this 9 -5 challenge toon?
[7:16:59] TheTokyoDevil: 5
[7:17:02] handlebarswow: Gm Hammer Squad
[7:17:03] Just_Jack13: 100% rather stay 60
[7:17:03] SiXKiNG_: cant wait to see LFR jailer lol
[7:17:06] supermintyfresh: Dragon iexpansion is bait the old gods actually took over everything
[7:17:07] noLaG_: Leveling wouldnt be so bad if they didnt make you do 4 storyline's by the time the last patch comes out..
[7:17:07] BTiZZY_: @realwhiski not a bad idea
[7:17:09] stoke: imagine what a fresh breeze it would be to not need to level up
[7:17:12] Saltytyphoon: yup gf this this
[7:17:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Being level 120 might feel cooler, but what is the point
[7:17:15] tebbix: No changes Madge
[7:17:16] handlebarswow: I like leveling tbh
[7:17:16] yanansmootlol: I think we would be at level 140 if they didnt lower the cap in shadowlands
[7:17:18] Rizdk: Page is on top of the broken bridge
[7:17:22] coffeelover29: they are tiny
[7:17:22] Lothawia: I want to level it wouldnt be the same without it
[7:17:23] mavericks312: you take away leveling from a new xpac and the community will riot
[7:17:25] PapaPing1: @Towelliee  Spread out laying around
[7:17:28] Alaquane: just squish us back to 50
[7:17:29] faulen: getting levels or not, we will still have to go though a campaign
[7:17:30] Ispintowin: Good morning @towelliee and chat
[7:17:31] Mistery836: I want a way to scale down when I'm max level to go through the zone's story :P
[7:17:31] Odinslayer: zoom out the mini map @Towelliee
[7:17:33] Kisswani: whatever system they come up with other than leveling will be contained within the expansion . That would be the ultimate borrowed power system
[7:17:35] supermintyfresh: expac without leveling would be weird
[7:17:43] Saltytyphoon: I wan't to dance, what?
[7:17:47] fooxytv: World of Warcraft: Battle for Shadowlands on Draenor
[7:17:47] yanansmootlol: Yeah they need leveling and new zones
[7:17:49] LordOverflow_II: When do you think the expac will release?
[7:17:53] Nejba: @ChrisarN cos 9.2.5 will last a long while
[7:17:54] supermintyfresh: @fooxytv stop it
[7:17:57] Qargory: only mentioning because you seemed concerned a couple hours ago, are you not doing way over hours today?
[7:18:00] Korupcija_: the msq + threads of fate was amazing, just need to improve threads of fate
[7:18:04] Antdavs24: Revert back to 50 and scale down SL like other old content maybe
[7:18:07] Saltytyphoon: ty for stealing
[7:18:07] blazeofhell: tbf, they already did level/stat squish previously so the tech for squishing is in place so they can harmlessly use it in future expansions
[7:18:08] Velashen: Leveling and gaining experience toward an alternate system would be cool. I like seeing a bar move.
[7:18:09] oSirKnight: something like what destiny 2 did with power increase instead of level grind? make a hard cap on ilvl before dungeons?
[7:18:16] ChrisarN: I want Tinker
[7:18:18] de_boinked: @towelliee do you think we will be able to pre purchase it today?
[7:18:23] supermintyfresh: @oSirKnight oo thats not a terrible ideaaa
[7:18:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dragon Aspect Power!
[7:18:30] Odinslayer: some kind of a roster level would be cool like lost ark
[7:18:42] BirdieXL: Youre right, leveling is so irrelevant now, they should make it like a campaign quest line
[7:18:48] Vexxsis: just code it
[7:18:56] RealWhiski: Where can we watch the reveal? Is it live?
[7:18:56] Verdigo__: WoW tokens went up like 40k overnight lol
[7:18:58] Gruffian: No way they announce and dont let you buy today
[7:19:00] TwitchGurls: once u level 1 toon to 60...it should then unlock every other class at 60...no more leveling required ....hooray!!!
[7:19:02] Erielle04: The preorder links are there just not visible to us
[7:19:05] TheTokyoDevil: what code
[7:19:07] handlebarswow: oh hell yeah, the amount of ppl that will pre order just from the announcement hype.. absolutely you will be able today
[7:19:08] MizixTV: They are just gonna drop us to 50, Add Shadowlands to Chromie, and we level to 60 in new xpack….
[7:19:10] HaloS23: @Towelliee just give me the physicall collectors edition!!!
[7:19:18] ChrisarN: did they scrap 8.3? @towelliee
[7:19:18] atamala: like guild wars 2
[7:19:18] Rataplany: gw2 mastery system?
[7:19:19] Kisswani: @BirdieXL Honestly to me it's more psychological . just used to a new expansion with a higher level
[7:19:22] LordOverflow_II: What is Blizzard Twitch for WoW? playwarcraft?
[7:19:24] eplix59: @Towelliee why are you lvling in bfa content if you cant fly ? wouldnt it be faster to lvl in a chromie time zone where you can fly ? knowing that this is a brand new account
[7:19:26] fcwar_: @Towelliee New possible in-game leaked SS, this one is HD. Same guy who leaked early this morning
[7:19:28] a23pk: a23pk1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 50 Months BABBYYYYY
[7:19:33] Rev_Furyas: leveling is irrelevant now, they literally squish lvls every few expansions it makes no difference
[7:19:36] FranciscoTheMage: so if theres no raising of the level cap is it really an expansion @Towelliee ?
[7:19:36] miriones: just make WoW 2 on UE5
[7:19:37] KonaWolfeee: yooo kragnos still here?
[7:19:38] Angryfist40: Tree of Asses?
[7:19:39] Bernardo994: tree of asss
[7:19:39] ZeusDNA: I'd love to just do story quests over random go gather this or kill that with no association to the actual story of the game
[7:19:41] WestonTeli: I really hope the expansion looks good. if I see any systems like bfa or legion I'm out for good
[7:19:41] IianaDRK: tree. night elves. ysera. dragons. half life 3 confirmed

[7:19:47] Moobot: @Towelliee @fcwar_ will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[7:19:50] Novirtue_: It would be absolutely hilarious if the expansion ended up not having anything about dragons LUL
[7:19:51] Nebulizer87: gw2 is ahead of its time in terms of systems and such just not as big of an audience
[7:19:54] WestonTeli: shadowlands*
[7:19:58] Saltytyphoon: oh            shit
[7:19:59] Endogenous_: Would be cool if they did some sort of AI (similar to scenarios) for old raids.  Shorten campaign stories and make it linear across expansions for levelling.  Each campaign ends with the AI raid, and moves into next expansion.
[7:19:59] lithium364: must be lore Kappa

[7:21:15] Khaghar: With threads of fate added I don't see a reason why they won't just allow to level to max in old content. Why am I being forced to spam dungeons/world quests from current expansion when not doing campaing?
[7:21:16] curv6: same
[7:21:18] batu_0596: i quit lost ark because its boring content but good gameplay
[7:21:18] Saltytyphoon: funk?

[7:24:30] Odinslayer: @Vexxsis yea i know, i doubt we will get a 2022 release, but having 9.2/9.2.5 for 12months+ gonna hurt af

[7:24:49] tebbix: Too early KEKW
[7:24:50] bypized: 16k its not even BF2042 peak
[7:24:51] SkariksGaming: true wow fans died 2012
[7:24:53] Vexxsis: @Odinslayer better find another game
[7:24:53] tocu: people need to remember we dont have a date for the 2nd season of 9.2 that feels like July or Augost for the start of that
[7:24:57] LordOverflow: Is there any new class speculations?
[7:25:00] coffeelover29: waiting for asmon
[7:25:04] fabrix_1993: @Towelliee I'm really hoping for a new class & or race. What you think?

[7:25:26] Janigiv: least tested monkaS

[7:25:27] Odinslayer: @Vexxsis yea idd, combination of lost ark and other games will do it
[7:25:27] yanansmootlol: Im predicting december
[7:25:28] Kneckt: Kappa
[7:25:28] Novirtue_: From previous expansions it's 319 days from announcement isn't it? so it might be by March :D
[7:25:30] toocheap2rhyme: youre scaring us bro
[7:25:32] Cerein: I dont see them doing another year without content
[7:25:35] stresstest: Testing clearly proves it changes nothing, might as well just release it Kappa
[7:25:37] adxx: i wish wildstar was still around
[7:25:39] iisobase: They test stuff? KappaHD
[7:25:39] handlebarswow: depends on if you believe how early into SL they began working on it
[7:25:40] Tauren0309: You have two clocks on the screen
[7:25:43] mavericks312: im gonna say mid February for the release
[7:25:45] fooxytv: could it be any different now with the take over? bigger team etc?
[7:25:45] kappaday23: Kappa
[7:25:47] pacificmc1: It's gonna be 12th November :)
[7:25:50] ZeusDNA: I'm praying for at least a year to launch so I can save up my PTO after using it all for the honeymoon later this year haha
[7:25:50] fkinthiccbro: nah bro, let them take their time, i dont want a half finished product
[7:25:51] Saltytyphoon: justin a bow/
[7:25:53] xhale2nhale: @1337raids do tell how most of us are still here just old
[7:25:54] DethShrimp: To be fair, WoW kind of has a TON to make up for with this xpac. It needs to be balls-to-the-wall incredible. A lot of us want to come back but this needs to be great.
[7:25:56] bypized: @Towelliee so youre telling me they are announcing Wildstar?
[7:25:56] Janigiv: BABY I LIKE IT RAAAAAWWW catJAM
[7:26:02] Norrdinger: didnt you tell a year ago that the new expansion will be something complet new? @Towelliee
[7:26:03] kniftty: I wonder if Blizzard is able to be back in their normal working situation/hours yet. It seems clear development was hampered quite a bit by covid protocols they had to follow
[7:26:05] MrGharr: u don't have to test a perfect product
[7:26:09] Saltytyphoon: ty hunters
[7:26:12] bypized: Start the countdown
[7:26:13] Hawkseye: Remember BfA releasing a month early because it was so far ahead of it's schedule? KEKW
[7:26:18] Reonan33: 284 ??!?! so xmas 2024?
[7:26:19] bypized: Countdown on screen
[7:26:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: People said BFA had a bunch of bugs
[7:26:22] Ortinoth: they will never do enough testing
[7:26:24] brewgamingtv: rather them take their time for 10.0
[7:26:24] Odinslayer: but you dunno how far they are in develepoment, maybe they are in good position @Towelliee
[7:26:25] pacificmc1: No It will be November 12th :)
[7:26:32] Kezeth: Prayge
[7:26:33] amricatt: I would rather take longer
[7:26:34] FresheFefe: launch tomorow FeelsGoodMan
[7:26:35] mrz_as: Kappa
[7:26:37] Saltytyphoon: lovr that
[7:26:42] kniftty: If we are lucky, we get beta starting in Nov/Dec right?
[7:26:43] blazeofhell: Feedback LULW
[7:26:44] Undeadfish12: Please no
[7:26:46] yanansmootlol: They probably are ahead of schedule
[7:26:47] mmrghost7: who is that who is leaking everything fire that guy LUL
[7:26:47] mackieeswe: spring 2023
[7:26:50] ShaggyRain: then they going to be competiting with the riot mmo monkaS
[7:26:52] Mitune: maybe we are lucky and they have a shit ton of resources this time Copium
[7:26:52] xhale2nhale: say what you will about BFA it had alot of content, but I still think that xpac wouldve been great if they made it so the Alliance was the attackers
[7:26:52] bypized: @Towelliee are you including COVID-42?
[7:26:54] Vexxsis: all good , will be pooring hours into gotham knights and harry potter before expansion
[7:26:55] Verdigo__: It would make sense for 2023 considering how much this feels like it needs to be a home run. Also WOTLK classic and WoW mobile to fill in the rest of this year to build hype.
[7:26:55] Janigiv: next year? time to play some SWTOR @Towelliee PogChamp or im gonna lose my mind
[7:26:57] TombStoneMercenary: But would blizz be willing to pass on that holiday cash @Towelliee ??
[7:26:58] tragx: Hot take: They would've announced the expansion last November during Blizzcon. We have to count from there.
[7:27:00] Svendv: @SivvSins just delete alliance Kappa
[7:27:00] Cerein: from normal schedule of blizzcon this would have probably been announced 5 months ago
[7:27:01] vaironixx: maybe its possible they put more resources into the expac earlier since we didnt get as many patches in SL
[7:27:01] EvilStreak: monkaS whats the worst that can happen
[7:27:01] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee whats the timeframe from announcement to alpha \ beta?
[7:27:01] pacificmc1: A disgruntled senior level janitor told me it's coming November 12th.
[7:27:03] handlebarswow: Valentines Day is a Tuesday next year.. 2/14/2023.. because Blizz is gonna prove they REALLY DO LOVE US... lol.. COPIUM
[7:27:04] Maellin: way ahead of schedule? after the drama and changes internally? no.
[7:27:05] paulwow777: KEKW
[7:27:07] gurkhan7: dude how the fuck you set your camera that far of the toon?
[7:27:08] obscurrium: @Towelliee do you think they will announce an Alpha or Beta soon ?
[7:27:08] MrGharr: launch just before Microsoft deal ends.
[7:27:09] fooxytv: another year! :(
[7:27:11] Reonan33: @Towelliee but why then they announce it today? and why no 9.3?
[7:27:11] Alaquane: Launching later today slootClown
[7:27:15] Ispintowin: Still gotta go through 9.2.5 so it’s gonna have to be next year
[7:27:16] cahoots82: different team works on SL and 10.0 though, right?
[7:27:17] Antdavs24: I’m anticipating Q1 23
[7:27:20] bypized: @Towelliee are you including COVID-42??
[7:27:22] Layercake: They are at least 6 months behind
[7:27:24] Novirtue_: I appreciate blizzard for hiring a lore expert for next expansion :D
[7:27:26] Ortinoth: we still have season 4 and 9 25 to get
[7:27:27] hagmania: what about the time between alpha release? maybe they are just announcing later Kappa
[7:27:27] raye_gaming22: they dropped SL like 1 year ago
[7:27:29] Fubarlogixx: @Towelliee maybe this is what they were working on whenb they didnt put a patch out for over a year
[7:27:29] thasch: fo sho next year - there is no way they release it this year. Unless they have worked their ass off (lol) - but with covid and the lawsuits and the walkouts for sho next year
[7:27:29] Korupcija_: xd
[7:27:30] Keirmot: I tmakes no sense to have a quick test period if we're not even half way through Season 3 and we WILL have a Season 4.
[7:27:30] Dirtnose: @cahoots82 no, the a and b team thing is a myth
[7:27:31] duffluv22: New COD will be out in Nov...Ill be fine
[7:27:32] mavericks312: unless by 9.1 they said screw it start 10.0 i think there right on schedule
[7:27:33] Fubarlogixx: lol
[7:27:37] Endogenous_: I'm hopeful for December
[7:27:43] mmrghost7: we need 11.0 classic
[7:27:49] Praetour: If they do January they'd do December just before Christmas for sales
[7:27:49] Phae__: Please don't release before next year.
[7:27:54] yanansmootlol: Atleast wrath will come out faster
[7:27:56] FearedtheLegend: do you think alot of people will resub to wow today?
[7:27:57] Odinslayer: you clicking the D/E button
[7:27:57] fabrix_1993: @Towelliee I'm really hoping for a new class & or race. What you think?
[7:27:57] Phae__: Take your time, and give us mega content from the beginning
[7:28:01] toocheap2rhyme: rather hear news on D4 over new WoW. want that shit to be nice polished this time around. let them take their time and do it right
[7:28:02] tocu: I feel like any game being ahead of schedule at blizzard at this point would be a miracle with the termoil of leadership in the last year
[7:28:03] bypized: @Towelliee are they announcing HOTS revival?
[7:28:03] Dongtanian: feb release would be best for me. hit that lull after football season
[7:28:09] ResidentMadman: you need to go to fountain first
[7:28:10] Svendv: @mavericks312 i mean it wouldnt surprise me if you saw how bad 9.1 was
[7:28:12] mavericks312: @Endogenous_ no one wants a december release especially with a 2week vacation
[7:28:16] Rooseweld: It will release November this year and Wrath in September
[7:28:20] Neckro89: Maybe Daddy Microsoft will give them plenty of time to get it out in good condition
[7:28:20] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u need to go to fountaqin first sir
[7:28:21] Vexxsis: if they release this year...i think thats a big oof
[7:28:21] Mitune: id love a longer pre-patch with the new season 4 ideas
[7:28:22] miriones: wait isnt this expansion already over? what are they gonna do for 1 year
[7:28:23] Keirmot: @Towelliee It makes no sense to have a quick test period if we're not even half way through Season 3 and we WILL have a Season 4.
[7:28:23] WoWRoach: Have to water those things with item
[7:28:28] Janigiv: what if the norm changes @Towelliee ?
[7:28:29] yanansmootlol: When microsoft take over subs will be a thing of the past
[7:28:36] bypized: @Towelliee are they announcing HOTS revival?!
[7:28:40] Blazer_6_6: @miriones season 4
[7:28:47] mavericks312: @yanansmootlol wrong
[7:28:52] Amarlian: I would rather it come out 2023 and a better patch release schedule @Towelliee
[7:28:53] Rottencoarse: not that one @Towelliee  other one
[7:28:57] KragnosWoW: People still play HOTS? KEKW
[7:28:59] Blazer_6_6: @GrandmaTroyb no
[7:29:00] Endogenous_: @mavericks312 A 2 week vacation is what you want for a release lol
[7:29:01] Odinslayer: @Towelliee you clicking the d/e button
[7:29:04] Cerein: if it is a full year that would put classic and retail off 6 months which makes some sense
[7:29:05] Novirtue_: 164 minutes to go or 9840 seconds to go, but who's counting novirtPog
[7:29:07] laito_: @Towelliee Did u say this new xpac was gonna be DIFFERENT because they cant mess it up this time or  ?
[7:29:07] bob2305: I mean theyre on microsoft schedule now. So it can change who knows
[7:29:09] Vexxsis: blizz gonna anounce a season pass with sub fee

[7:29:12] hnti86: soon(TM) Kappa
[7:29:14] aribellae: @Towelliee They've also already stated that they'd like seasons to be 6-8 months long. So even on the short end of that we're still 10 months out from pre-patch. No way is it this year.
[7:29:18] Manyfist: StarCraft 3 when?
[7:29:23] Scoodles91: if they have preorders they have to say by when it will be released
[7:29:24] PToastman: Sooooon
[7:29:25] TomReforged: Have hey ever not said when it will launch during an event?
[7:29:25] miriones: @Blazer_6_6 isnt the story of this expansion over? so that means no raids?
[7:29:25] gfvaris: I want new on riot MMO they have been too quite
[7:29:26] fabrix_1993: When i pre order today will i get my boost along with the mount/pet/Tmog?
[7:29:27] raye_gaming22: there has to be a date for the EU preoder laws
[7:29:28] DethShrimp: What's the point of spending 2K channel points for a highlighted message if you don't respond lmao
[7:29:28] Ortinoth: @Towelliee  well if pre orders go up we will know the drop dead month
[7:29:28] JQ47: why would they plan for s4 unless they were expecting at least a  year from 9.2
[7:29:32] Verdigo__: @Toweliee what are your thoughts on new race/class combos? Night Elf pallys perhaps?
[7:29:35] yanansmootlol: @mavericks312 Nope WoW classic will become a free game retail will remain the same imo
[7:29:35] Odinslayer: you were but you were clicking the d/e button xD
[7:29:38] Antdavs24: It’s definitely early next year at the earliest
[7:29:40] thasch: which expansion will be the last classic? Wrath?
[7:29:42] mavericks312: @Endogenous_ no but in december blizz takes 2 weeks of for the holidays no one wants a release full of bugs with no one around
[7:29:44] Blazer_6_6: @miriones look up shadlowlands season 4
[7:29:44] KragnosWoW: Launch day is may 16th, 2023
[7:29:49] Ispintowin: I feel like alpha is February and beta in march and pre patch next April LUL
[7:29:52] visaeris412: they have already said they are doing season 4 for SL, only a month or so into season 3? very small chance that its this year
[7:30:02] yanansmootlol: @thasch Everything up until WoD
[7:30:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: so much HOPEIUM
[7:30:07] duffluv22: Feb, 2023!!!!
[7:30:08] feherlofia123: @thasch they wont do cata

[7:30:09] xhale2nhale: @yanansmootlol you know get both game for the price of one right?
[7:30:10] im__herb: 9.2 is the best modern wow patch
[7:30:10] Layercake: HahaThink Release is next year ...with gamepass
[7:30:16] Phae__: 9.2.5 was mid. 9.3.5 even better, I'm guessing
[7:30:22] SkariksGaming: except these days blizzard fired litteraly everyone
[7:30:23] bypized: @Towelliee There's a new in-game cutscene added in 9.2.5 called; "9.2.5_[LCF]_Shot_1110_IGC"
[7:30:23] Phae__: @ImBatguy 9.2.5*
[7:30:24] handlebarswow: towHype
[7:30:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: A lot of changes during the beta are likely, yeah
[7:30:25] Gruffian: 9.2 would have been a wreck if they didnt listen to all the feedback
[7:30:28] Mitune: lets hope
[7:30:28] Blazer_6_6: @Layercake to early for gamepass stuff
[7:30:31] Odinslayer: how long you think season 3 and 4 will last?
[7:30:31] Ortinoth: we don't even have 9.2.5
[7:30:32] obscurrium: @Towelliee do you think they will announce an Alpha or Beta soon ?
[7:30:33] Reonan33: @Towelliee 10.0 when microsoft is taking over
[7:30:41] AngelsMatt: @ImBatguy funny they say the same thing about 8.2
[7:30:45] Shaele: they do need a miracle to pull back their reputation, but I doubt they could put out the next xpac this year
[7:30:52] Poppsalt: announcing next enxpansion on xbox game pass
[7:30:54] onybear: I don’t want them to rush things…I am so tired of half-assed thing in the game and then having a whole content patch used for fixing things….
[7:30:55] Akoudadis: @Towelliee was mythic Raid too difficult for RWF?
[7:30:57] Ortinoth: season 4 will last till the new xpac
[7:31:01] board4life65: 11.0 = window 11
[7:31:09] im__herb: @phae__ in terms of quality yes
[7:31:11] Svendv: @Shaele a new xpac usually attracs also the gone playebase. Look at SL after BFA
[7:31:12] WestonTeli: guess I'll wait for 11.0 then
[7:31:13] mavericks312: you guys do realize MS isnt gonna change up anything with WoW right?
[7:31:13] cabalish: the microsoft deal is not even 100% , so lets see
[7:31:17] xomegaprime: they are probably working on the development though overall
[7:31:17] Vexxsis: @board4life65 windows 11 has been out dafuq
[7:31:19] ShrenTheOrc: i want horde sails in sot lol
[7:31:21] Odinslayer: how long season 3 will last? @Towelliee
[7:31:21] N3llee: good morning.. just getting going any leaks?
[7:31:25] N3llee: early media slips?
[7:31:30] tocu: This is assumeing MS is alloud to purchase it
[7:31:36] Cerein: Do you think they pull the no cost expansion rip cord now if they expect this to be going to gamepass anyways
[7:31:38] fabrix_1993: Can someone here help me get my AOTC
[7:31:41] kekwnano: @Towelliee maybe they announce cross faction raiding?
[7:31:44] Krunklock: difficulty was perfect...length was just too long
[7:31:44] gurkhan7: do you think they are bringing back ML for guild groups?
[7:31:48] Manyfist: Apparently in Slyvanas novel the Jailer predicted the Legion expansion back in Wrath.
[7:31:50] Mitune: the Degeneracy was TOO DAMN HIGH this time
[7:31:50] SkariksGaming: 12.0 questing with master chief
[7:31:54] Endogenous_: Wouldn't be surprised if the acquisition is cancelled.
[7:31:56] fabrix_1993: I have gotten all other ones since Mists but hard to do with no guild..
[7:32:02] luckfore: could 9.2.5 be today? or next week?
[7:32:03] AngelsMatt: @ImBatguy a "better" patch for modern wow  is still a bad bad patch in term of quality,BFA=SL anything better than that is still bad,legion was the lwast good expansion of wow
[7:32:05] Erielle04: @nvn0 they did like 3 months ago
[7:32:15] KragnosWoW: What would prevent them?
[7:32:19] mavericks312: the way the government hates MS i wouldnt be suprised if the sale fell thru
[7:32:21] gurkhan7: wow has a lot of troubles, anyone give a shit about lore.. lol
[7:32:21] Saltytyphoon: if you knew
[7:32:23] Llamatude: @luckfore nope probably 3 months or so
[7:32:24] MortiousPrime: @Manyfist I mean, you can say that if you write the book after all of those things happen. That was a pointless statement
[7:32:29] Mistery836: nooo :(
[7:32:33] CritcobainTV: Time for 20s POGGERS

[7:33:11] Kolepto: So either we get dragons and Galakrond or that multi-headed multi-aspect dragon, or we get light vs void with scarlet crusade and more scourge?
[7:33:12] Mistery836: w8. why is the server going down? maintenance?

[7:34:22] xomegaprime: oh that sounds good
[7:34:25] KragnosWoW: Alt f4 because you’re gonna be late for class
[7:34:26] sirbillyy: what are the chances the new expansion actually makes retail playable?

[7:34:43] Smart_Parrot: I really like to see a new faction, especially with undead under the control of Calia Menethil (There was an encripyed model for her...)
[7:34:49] MrClaudeSeaburn: @Towelliee Do you like survival hunter so far?

[7:35:12] Saltytyphoon: yours is mine and
[7:35:14] QuigsTV: aqui
[7:35:15] Mecabeast: split 4 days instead of 7days cause responsibilities
[7:35:21] Praetour: World of Warcraft: Prime expansion??
[7:35:24] necromahr: do u see the Talenttree leak?
[7:35:26] RontheProton: It's about time for WoW to go F2P

[7:35:32] Divine_Miscreant: Divine_Miscreant subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[7:35:33] Theduskflyer: Hot take: remove splits by locking you to one raid difficultly. Either you do just heroic that week, or just mythic. Not all three. LFR is the exception
[7:35:33] PToastman: What’s a prime sub
[7:35:33] KragnosWoW: @blazeofhell that’s alt + tab lmao

[7:35:41] Phae__: Warcraft Prime. Blizzard Prime. Microsoft Prime.
[7:35:42] LordKain73: I'm primed up baby
[7:35:50] DeanoTV: WoW will never go f2p chat KEKW
[7:35:50] Svendv: @Theduskflyer the worst  thing i heard
[7:35:50] Kisswani: fuck no
[7:35:53] tikiret: tikihr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! hyped for expansion announcement!
[7:35:54] CritcobainTV: no shot
[7:35:58] Odinslayer: lol hell no
[7:35:59] shiingocrates: also 16 years with 15 bucks per month, i dunno if that gonna change
[7:36:00] fooxytv: wow battle pass
[7:36:00] Caloz7: that sounds awful
[7:36:00] DwarfWarrior25: your movement speed is the magic number
[7:36:02] sirbillyy: @Korupcija_ i know
[7:36:05] mavericks312: so you want a riot from mythic raiders huh
[7:36:07] Phae__: That would slow down the game HORRIBLY
[7:36:07] Mitune: also splits are a 1% issue anyway
[7:36:11] Vexxsis: you even awake writing that in chat lmfao
[7:36:12] Eziak: That would be trash.
[7:36:13] Blazer_6_6: any1 else having discord issues ? @chat
[7:36:14] Bulgogiprince: They want people to play their game man
[7:36:15] lukeymoo: i want less lockouts
[7:36:15] Phae__: you think shit's timegated now? Omegalul
[7:36:15] woltret: WoW battlepass when?
[7:36:22] lukeymoo: no lockout for mythic and up
[7:36:23] dongremlin: Has the expansion already been announced?
[7:36:24] Ashkenazii: I just want master loot back
[7:36:28] MrGharr: give mythic bosses limited attempts
[7:36:29] Eziak: They need to make it easier to pug, not harder. Who cares about RWF
[7:36:33] Naturalbeef: Who cares about splits
[7:36:34] JayoRed: ok ez add bank robberies instead of raids XD
[7:36:37] Jarlan23: why do they even need to fix something for 40 people anyway. let them do splits if theyre gonna do degen shit
[7:36:37] jure__: cant splits be solved by not allowing gear trade to someone that killed this boss already?
[7:36:40] Phae__: Mythic and UP? What UP?
[7:36:41] raye_gaming22: thats the catac lockout systems no bruh not gonna happen
[7:36:45] Saltytyphoon: this is not the start of ai!!!
[7:36:45] KragnosWoW: Sounds like lost ark Argos
[7:36:46] Nerdy1: I like the 9-5 challange idea. However, my thought on it is that a person that works 9-5 that plays 17ish hours a weeek isn't going to knock those hours out in one or two sittngs. It's going to be 3-4 hour play sessions. I wish it more played out like that througout the week.
[7:36:47] lukeymoo: mythic+
[7:36:51] Kisswani: I hope they kinda make normal raids in wings , basically divide the raid into sections and make you able to zone into the different zones after you clear the whole raid
[7:36:54] jax_hammer_: jax_hammer_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hoping we get ogres 🙃 been waiting since April fools 2004. LUL

[7:36:58] amricatt: @NoImDuck No.  The 2 hr 35 mins is the countdown to announcement
[7:37:00] shiingocrates: they need to make everything account wide at this point
[7:37:01] Verdigo__: @Towelliee  man im just wanting master loot back
[7:37:04] lukeymoo: let me be a degen and spam mythic all day
[7:37:04] zigzugg: zigzugg subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[7:37:09] LordKain73: when you arrive it time to see the boss die.  hate that shit!
[7:37:10] megamanx9999: I still say get rid of loot out of methick and make the highest item a little drop from heroic
[7:37:19] sirbillyy: retail wow sucks so hard. too much mindless grinding systems
[7:37:20] xomegaprime: ABI Mastermind
[7:37:21] JayoRed: did they say what time the stuff is today
[7:37:22] FranciscoTheMage: what degen behavior. im lost
[7:37:23] KragnosWoW: @taikoe then play classic
[7:37:25] xomegaprime: spookyunagCatnip spookyunagCatnip
[7:37:26] xNotorietyx: I hope account wide changes come this expansion
[7:37:29] megamanx9999: That way mythic can be there just for transmog in the top 1%
[7:37:30] Phae__: Mythic+ already doesn't have lockouts. So you're asking for regular mythic dungeons to not have a lockout or to make M+ raid a thing?
[7:37:33] sotsil_: @Towelliee imagine guilds not going into mythic first lockout just to farm tier or whatever the handicap is that tier xD
[7:37:33] RontheProton: can we see the bingo card?
[7:37:37] sotsil_: ow the madge
[7:37:40] DeanoTV: @sirbillyy go back to classic and wait 20 seconds to press 1 button KEKW
[7:37:43] coffeelover29: LUL
[7:37:44] MarquisLek: in 2 hours
[7:37:45] Stonefather: I mean you have two timers
[7:37:47] raye_gaming22: we need the BFA loot system back minus WF and with the valut thats it
[7:37:48] N3llee: nah people are just stupied
[7:37:48] lukeymoo: u cant run the same key level for a dungeon
[7:37:48] Odinslayer: its a bit small
[7:37:49] Ziddrax: put them in red
[7:37:49] Kinghorn: twitch chat is blind and illiterate  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[7:37:50] ashwing_: FailFish
[7:37:50] Phae__: You already can spam +2s all day. They're virtually no harder than m0s

[7:37:57] Fubarlogixx: no theres just alot going on on your svreen
[7:37:57] lukeymoo: there is a lockout for each key per dungeon
[7:37:59] JayoRed: I'm blind af
[7:37:59] SaltyFelon: the blue is a little hard to read
[7:38:00] PurplePyrex: @Towelliee make it bigger for the towBlind
[7:38:01] N3llee: nah straight up dumbass
[7:38:02] CritcobainTV: That's what she said
[7:38:03] HardBenis: HardBenis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[7:38:04] smashwow: @Towelliee weird language, numbers rough Kappa
[7:38:04] itsDaegaron: ITS AVERAGE
[7:38:04] tebbix: It's fine people doesn't even read the titles
[7:38:04] DingDongDean: That's what she said Kappa
[7:38:05] Novirtue_: I love when people ask what time zone FailFish
[7:38:05] Mitune: ngl Blue actually hides it

[7:38:11] Sylphy_TV: its not smal xD
[7:38:11] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: the 2 clocks may confuse some people
[7:38:11] RavenHS: people probably think it is an addon Keepo
[7:38:11] FranciscoTheMage: i think its the blue or white
[7:38:12] sevens777s: I CANT READ
[7:38:12] tocu: @Towelliee The issue could be the 2 timers on screen throughing people off
[7:38:13] outbreak2005: Make it fill up the whole screen @Towelliee Kappa

[7:54:38] G1bz: wow 10 is actually actually cataclysm remastered
[7:54:38] Ralandis: Player housing would be nice change of pace for something Blizz promises... however seeing how housing is handled in FFXIV, I really do not think Blizz will put in the amount of effort needed to make it happen.
[7:54:39] DeanoTV: eww
[7:54:39] Merqury3: i prefer default over elvui now
[7:54:41] FlameStryke: they need to just pay the addon devs to join their company and scrap the default ui
[7:54:41] OlympicPNW: its for new players
[7:54:42] MILESkg21: LMAO KEKW
[7:54:42] gnaronius: default ui users are grey parsers
[7:54:42] donin: lot of people use default still
[7:54:44] ArericCirera: back in the day some of the best features were just things stolen from good addons
[7:54:45] Jokervenom1978: lol i always use the default ui
[7:54:47] Korupcija_: the UI dev on twitter was excited about something, maybe he revamped UI
[7:54:48] Rankle19: I don’t use add ons only for pvp
[7:54:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like the basic UI but even I have to use bartender to make it work efficiently
[7:54:48] luckfore: Razer Naga UI ftw
[7:54:50] blazeofhell: maybe they are planning to limit addons scope so they need a more robust UI
[7:54:51] Youredoneson666: pvp players mostly use default ui's because its better
[7:54:54] Tausgi: ADDONS REMOVED by blizzard!
[7:54:57] generaljosh721: New default UI could be a hint to disabling add ons?
[7:54:59] Tausgi: :)
[7:55:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: somehow Deathwing has returned...
[7:55:00] sulfater: I think you’d be shocked. I’d guess more than half of wow players don’t use a single add on
[7:55:04] syla90: can wow engine handle player housing? it seems unrealistic but who am i to know
[7:55:05] MILESkg21: no more addons allowed D:

[7:55:38] xomegaprime: spookyunagYe spookyunagYe spookyunagYe spookyunagYe
[7:55:38] LightBladeStream: If they remove addons, they need to make something amazing to replace them 󠀀 󠀀
[7:55:42] Metraphim: It would be cool if the begining of the expansion is you have nothing to do because everyone is at peace then it all kicks off.
[7:55:43] MR_WYTE: Weren’t all the leaks leading up to BFA totally wrong?
[7:55:46] swervo61: Do you think we will see the new zones or just the cinematic and name
[7:55:51] stabzmcgeee: after everything if they removed add ons that would be me done
[7:55:52] duffluv22: To the Vendicar!!!!!
[7:55:52] Tausgi: make me :) timeout and bannong not allowed :)
[7:55:53] seanb4games: The real twist is that Blizzard themselves are the Void Lords and have succeeded in destroying WoW already.
[7:55:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: More Dalaran is fine with me
[7:55:53] WhiteKnight74648: @FlameStryke mass exodus already happened lol
[7:55:58] graphicsfrog: we should get a mount like sandstone drake but better

[7:57:08] Ralandis: I mean, there is the capability for them to integrate a lot of what addons do into the game system, but again. That means a *massive* overhaul of the game that I highly doubt they will do. Speculation is fun though.

[9:28:44] Colt_Engineer: Hot Take, WoD was better than Shadowlands
[9:28:45] Tokies: The raiding and questing in WOD was good. It was just really slow patches
[9:28:49] paulson14: I feel like SL was worse then WOD.
[9:28:51] firekingkyle: Shadowland was the, "Last chance for Blizzard", proclaimed by most. Whats different with this upcomming xpac is it the Microsoft affect? Are we still holding our breath that they make the game fun again? Thanks.
[9:28:51] silverfang28: Am I the only one that liked WoD?

[9:29:25] akaari5486: i wanted WOD to be so good because i really like Orcs and their lore,like the aesthetics of wod,too bad
[9:29:25] Zephic: favourite expansion?
[9:29:29] sinlesssinner: the leveling and story and raids were amazing
[9:29:32] DeanoTV: WoD had actual 0 content
[9:29:33] Shammo: Yeah WoD was the worst ever
[9:29:33] Jango_: the raiding was good
[9:29:34] MILESkg21: only thing that saved it was Garrison streams
[9:29:37] Alegnowar: wod is a slightly worse sl
[9:29:37] DallTV_: @Fatpally haii champ =)
[9:29:37] darkdestroz: hot take, any1 that liked WoD is Bricked,

[9:29:39] xhaven: I likled the dreanor questing but after that nah
[9:29:40] sinlesssinner: content draught was terrible
[9:29:41] kzang_: in my opinion WOD was good it was just the lack of content that ruined it for me
[9:29:41] jaacobjames: honestly my favourite zones though i wont lie
[9:29:43] peinen: outside of raiding, nothing to do
[9:29:44] Hafcool: So, for example you are not allowed to stream servers like Warmane @Towelliee
[9:29:44] blascotwitch: WoD > Shadowlands
[9:29:45] Lexi__Marie: i dont raid, i thought draenor was fine
[9:29:46] ArchMystery: Hey @Towelliee You have a list of weakaurus that you use somewhere? i like the clean look.
[9:29:46] Robodope: depends how much you loved mission tables
[9:29:49] DeanoTV: SELFIE CAM PATCH btw KEKW
[9:29:49] falldrgn: I enjoyed the Questing in WOD.
[9:29:49] agev2019: i think Draenor and Mists probably had the worst balancing for PvP lol
[9:29:51] ramiehunter: @Towelliee  you Think WoD or BFA was worse?`i kinda liked it as a raider
[9:29:52] Quakezilla69: dungeons always top tier too
[9:29:54] KyzenHD: Wod was more casual friendly tbh
[9:29:56] WayneG947: thats the best part of WoW every expansion
[9:29:58] Kinghorn: TTours
[9:30:01] motorboatingpro: draenor raids were decent, but you had nothing else to do
[9:30:01] MILESkg21: SELFIE CAM with TWITTER LuL
[9:30:02] Decree34: when you put it that way I agree
[9:30:03] Its_Immanis: two expansions from now people will be talking about how "Shadowlands wasn't that bad" too
[9:30:03] skymercii: WoD PVP was the best
[9:30:04] lawles_walrus: Towliee bringing things back, i have thought more about earlier. We are the bad guys, Visions of nazoth was showing how evil azeroth would get. Illidan was right Kappa
[9:30:05] Gruffian: People complain about lack of content in Shadowlands while defending WoD omegalul
[9:30:10] duhworks: wow or SLs
[9:30:10] ramiehunter: what?
[9:30:12] KragnosWoW: wod lacked content
[9:30:13] duhworks: wod*
[9:30:15] mavericks312: WoD is the worst xpac ever
[9:30:16] fragadintv: i have gotten the same gloves for the past 5 weeks
[9:30:17] BoezIRL: gold farming was good in wod
[9:30:19] Ghhost117: Cataclysm was my favorite xpac tbh, then wotlk.
[9:30:20] OlStubbs: The raiding and dungeons were amazing in WOD but the majority of the game was sitting in garrisons
[9:30:21] reinhardtdog: I don't understand the hatred for BFA
[9:30:21] George2001k: @towelliee I loved WoD! I made 5mil gold
[9:30:23] coffeelover29: i wish wod wasnt the fastest leveling timewalking
[9:30:23] kashmara: I had fun in bfa *shrug*

[9:30:32] fletch8: tbc
[9:30:34] Lexi__Marie: people who liked story wont say draenor was bad the amount of characters they introduced was good
[9:30:34] ramiehunter: Bfa was shite tho
[9:30:34] yshtola1337: i enjoyed bfa thats the one we got mommy waifu jaina in hernew model
[9:30:36] Miertez: feels like ashran was the divider in wod if you liked it you liked the expansion as well
[9:30:40] Anyerfillag: Anyerfillag subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[9:30:42] MetalHeadTwo: WoD over SL anytime for me.
[9:30:43] xhale2nhale: only thing ppl hated about BFA is story tbh
[9:30:44] Greybeard_ttv: if wod had world quests it would have been a lot better
[9:30:44] blascotwitch: Shadowlands worst exp ever by a mile
[9:30:45] anticensor_: WoD was better than SL and BFA but I am pvper
[9:30:45] TSquadSully: BFA was great fun
[9:30:50] TacDuc: I really liked a lot of the BfA things, and the cinematics were just *Chef's kiss*
[9:30:53] Dongtanian: bfa catches too much heat
[9:30:55] xhale2nhale: Azerite shit aswell
[9:30:56] skymercii: bfa ResidentSleeper

[9:31:03] LadyKawa: im the only perosn that loved island expedition @Towelliee
[9:31:07] Meeckah: Anyone know what the affixes are this week
[9:31:13] akaari5486: I really wish they update old world to SL ,BFA graphics and make all expansions relevant,i miss old zone feeling and music..so much nostalgia
[9:31:14] KragnosWoW: i think there should be bad luck protection for mounts, i dont see why we should kill a boss 2k times to get their mount
[9:31:15] skymercii: yes
[9:31:15] Teldrin89: tbh just bc it's more content in bfa doesn't mean it was good
[9:31:20] akuma_46: hey
[9:31:21] KyzenHD: 8.3 was bad though
[9:31:25] Voidemirl: i just hope for nw borrowed power

[9:31:27] Shadoww_Fox: as a casual player Shadowlands are far worser than anything else in WOW... i played since Pandaria
[9:31:27] Short_Film: BfA had the tough task of coming after Legion
[9:31:29] Electafuzz: LUL
[9:31:30] Crocfacex: i actually liked BFA
[9:31:32] DallTV_: hahha
[9:31:37] JeusesRengo: I remember in Legion I used to solo 1 billion HP elites with my fury warrior . It was so fun back then . Probably my favourite expansion
[9:31:41] Umbrella_corp_soldier: incoming that we have SL for another year. Goes down as 2nd worst xpac of all time
[9:31:42] Lexi__Marie: @LadyKawa i did islands for fun
[9:31:43] Gruffian: Greatest tier of all time
[9:31:43] jazzl3: 8.3 was fun
[9:31:43] xhale2nhale: yea BFA wasnt as bad as ppl made it out to be and I literally played every xpac to the end
[9:31:44] TSquadSully: 8.3 was good lol
[9:31:44] peinen: @KyzenHD nah it was great
[9:31:45] mercethecurse: BFA was fine, there was just a lot of negativity surrounding it with the twitch crowd
[9:31:46] vDrYuukey: 8.3 was the best patch in bfa
[9:31:46] SphinxyOCE: 8.3 was good

[11:53:16] Nayfal: I’m kind of curious about the evokers class color LUL
[11:53:17] CrunkyBrewster: Quality is a FF14 thing actually. It seems like they are borrowing a lot from FF, which I am fine with
[11:53:18] Nerendis: "WHo asked"
[11:53:20] ghostblade_888: NotLikeThis

[11:53:48] Short_Film: Cinematic looked cool but it really didnt set up the story well
[11:53:49] jeffnsteff2019: thats called a build up
[11:53:49] thee_country_boy_gangsta: neithe did Blizz
[11:53:50] CrunkyBrewster: i knew it was based in War of the Ancients
[11:53:52] Miertez: there were clues about the dragons but it was so slow
[11:53:54] 91Niki: @Towelliee I was like "old god????" the old time during the beginning
[11:53:55] jeffnsteff2019: or anticipation
[11:53:55] ReinholdtRanger: Im so glad that we dont have a brand new system with borrowed power
[11:53:55] pereadin: I literally cried when stone boy fell
[11:53:57] Glynn11: glynn11 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[11:54:03] zigzugg: @Towelliee  you saw dragon shadows fly over at the beginning when the stone guy looks up

[11:54:27] CrunkyBrewster: yeah im down witht he Ancients
[11:54:27] Artemisthemp: Plot twist: Sylvans and Nethanos daughter gonna show in the middle of the expansion and be the choosen one

[11:54:40] dwolters_the_zombieman: so eversong woods, ghostlands, azure mist isle and blood mist isle still no fly zones then
[11:54:40] FergusCreative: I feel like they may retcon a lot of stuff for the new generation of player
[11:54:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY

[11:54:44] Molvonos: Prolly one storyline's gonna be getting Wraithion up to snuff as an aspect, taking the position from Thrall.
[11:54:47] KragnosWoW: Im a black dragon evoker main now POGGERS
[11:54:49] FlameStryke: this is their chance to retcon the entire lore
[11:54:56] IianaDRK: he said as azeroth is awakening it woke the watchers up @Towelliee
[11:54:57] DeanoTV: @KragnosWoW no ME
[11:54:57] mmrghost7: better call saul
[11:54:58] Tokies: more like captain planet
[11:54:58] Incredible_Sausage: think we're gonna have any corrupted watcher bosses?  󠀀
[11:54:59] gidgeet: I am cool with that
[11:55:02] Llamatude: I think that Elune called them
[11:55:02] DeathLV: yea
[11:55:05] Kneckt: rewtach the cinematic
[11:55:05] sRampage: @towelliee how do feel about the Wrath with “changes” announcement?
[11:55:05] Nerendis: Yes
[11:55:07] Kneckt: it says in beginning
[11:55:08] Todmeister9000: until Azeroth wakes up
[11:55:08] Ezekyler: yes
[11:55:09] Krelivane_: Yeah, they didn't want the Legion ti find the isles
[11:55:09] darssia_: they said azeroth has been healing though? like since we've been gone.
[11:55:09] CrunkyBrewster: ok?
[11:55:10] greenmanalpha: yep
[11:55:10] DarkFlameRaven: Yea
[11:55:11] Nayfal: @jekky34 Black LUL
[11:55:11] Zzorski: until azeroth could be healed
[11:55:12] vic_ave: @Towelliee aren't the aspect's chilling in wyrmrest temple in wrath this whole time?
[11:55:13] reallyhiddendragon: from everyone including themselves for protection yeah
[11:55:14] Tzarrus: and to hide the Titan facilities ...yeah
[11:55:14] duffluv22: no
[11:55:15] HaloS23: @Towelliee calling it now. Wrathion make Thrall an honorary Black Dragon!!!!
[11:55:16] OGXanos: did they show where it was on the map?
[11:55:18] 91Niki: blobDance Who we gonna call?! THE DRAGON ASPECTS blobDance
[11:55:19] Snabido: They put it far down on the To-Do list
[11:55:21] TacDuc: They had to heal the world before they could activate the tower again
[11:55:23] TigasLIVE: No pre order weird
[11:55:24] CrunkyBrewster: like hiding Vegas
[11:55:24] vakaarian: So there is no pre-order?
[11:55:24] Kisswani: When they showed 10000 years ago I almost lost my shit
[11:55:26] zerkx1: the players will have to join the aspects. that means you'll have to pick which aspect to join aka new covenants
[11:55:27] Nerendis: The land was kinda dying, they left until it started coming alive again @Towelliee sundering damaged it badly
[11:55:27] FranciscoTheMage: we just fought alongside the ASPECTS in CATA
[11:55:30] edeasknight: the land was dead. i guess they hid it so that it could heal.
[11:55:32] Todmeister9000: @Towelliee will you watch the cinematic again?
[11:55:32] FranciscoTheMage: they havent been gone long
[11:55:35] amricatt: I'm going to need Nobbel to explain the cinematic lore.
[11:55:40] fruchtfliegenkalle: I'm actually so hyped. And so my Wait begins..
[11:55:40] Artemisthemp: Sylvanas is the next Black Dragon queen :P
[11:55:40] DragonofWolves: I still can't believe every damn leak was right
[11:55:42] YungDizzY: So they re-wrote they ending of Dragon Soul?????????
[11:55:44] Tzarrus: nah, I'm betting Ebonhorn runs the Black Dragonflight
[11:55:46] propwash80: @Towelliee is WoW keeping the subscription model or are they changing?
[11:55:47] xomegaprime: I like hiding things
[11:55:47] jekky34: @nayfal kinda weird I was thinking the same thing LUL it’s the only “color” they haven’t used
[11:55:48] andricus_74: EXACTLY, he cant relay anything in a story,  basically he is trash!!!!  Has to explain whats in the fooker trailer because Desnoozer cant write to save his life.
[11:55:52] LspN: @Towelliee at the start of the cinematic you could see dragons above the clouds, at that moment i knew
[11:55:53] Dqob_: Nah man leave them be their own class and race
[11:55:54] KragnosWoW: ITS A HERO CLASS
[11:55:55] merzicdh: does this mean since wrathion being part of this i get to have another back piece?
[11:55:56] Bernardo994: not gonna haoen
[11:55:59] akaasti: I like that the Dragon race is limited
[11:56:00] UmmNoU: ya Im surprised dracthyr cant be other classes
[11:56:00] Alaquane: vulpera demonhunters when?
[11:56:02] Mitune: MINDBLOWING
[11:56:03] CrunkyBrewster: thats a big bonus!
[11:56:04] DeanoTV: yep hugeee
[11:56:05] Weegleman: dragon isles were drawing to much primal energy and were sealed it would seem
[11:56:06] ArcaneSyntax: LOADOUTS
[11:56:08] thekrispwns: the new class is a hero class soo there will not change it like demonhunters :D
[11:56:08] TheWarbringer: Zone had lost its magic, so they prob sealed it away so other species couldn’t use the knowledge left there
[11:56:09] Ortinoth: saving builds and changing at will will be awesome
[11:56:12] CrunkyBrewster: no addon needs is a win
[11:56:12] Atolanos: The evokers were creted by neltharion they couldnt be the other classes
[11:56:14] YungDizzY: Swtor already did that
[11:56:17] E_mark: the talent tree builds was cool. They ahd like 6 saved 󠀀
[11:56:17] Khlaro: Quailty of Life right there
[11:56:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Saving and loading talents is a big win, yeah
[11:56:21] HaloS23: Im stoked!!! Going to go farm all the drake mounts now!!!!
[11:56:22] Kisswani: @andricus_74 you ok buddy ? lots of anger right there
[11:56:23] Mortal_Wombat_: yea why not let the gnomes fly across battlefield
[11:56:23] R2RHIN0: RIP the tinker class again
[11:56:24] AdmiralZackbar: My question is: during Legion Senegos for example talked about how the flights were slowly dying. Dragons were no longer able to lay eggs. Are they going to address that? Are the dragon isles re-opening representative of the dragons being revitalized?
[11:56:26] Atolanos: Load out addons have been around forever though. SwitchSwitch for the win
[11:56:27] FranciscoTheMage: Loadouts
[11:56:28] Velashen: Yeah I wonder if you will be able to make blood DPS for instance..
[11:56:28] Snabido: Just dont add a cost to it monkaS
[11:56:28] Voramir: The website say you can fight in either dragon or human, but it'll likely be just dragon
[11:56:29] WoW_StandalonE: it will be a coocie cutter anyway
[11:56:34] Cal_Kat: Just sounds like a balance nightmare though specially come pvp
[11:56:34] zigzugg: its just gonna cost 10k gold per tree spec like before :)
[11:56:36] Jarwerewolf: pvp next level
[11:56:36] ArcaneSyntax: FROSTFIRE MAGE?
[11:56:37] abracka_: @YungDizzY so have a lot of games, horrible take
[11:56:38] okEllen: @HaloS23 Same :3
[11:56:39] Hakazo: @Towelliee No pre-purchase, pvp changes, missiontable, class/race combinations, raid showcase/dungeon showcase -  alot is missing imo but very excited yet
[11:56:39] 91Niki: Now can they PLEASE do similar for when swapping professions. Save your progress
[11:56:39] FergusCreative: FROSTFIRE MAGE
[11:56:42] IianaDRK: RETURN OF SHOCKADIN META
[11:56:43] ChieveMoe: Thats so cool dude
[11:56:47] Stormfyst: weredragons LUL
[11:56:47] Nerfbringer: Shockadins
[11:56:47] xomegaprime: SWTOR is broken
[11:56:47] MILESkg21: how much for RESPEC KEKW
[11:56:49] ArcaneSyntax: SHOCKADIN
[11:56:49] Tokies: what is prot holy like?
[11:56:50] dramaNOdrama: @Towelliee How do you feel about the new expansion?
[11:56:50] literally_human_garbage: YES FROSTFIRE BOLT PLEASE
[11:56:51] Byytet: Dragon ride encounter
[11:56:51] Konraddo: build/loadout should differ in play style, not power; hope that acheive that
[11:56:52] pacificmc1: @Towelliee So uh, the videos of you talking about 10.0 was  just bs KEKW
[11:56:53] fredforceride: that's too positive... if talent builds are back COOKIE CUTTER specs are back
[11:56:54] Tzarrus: I miss Frostfire tbh
[11:56:54] Phoxzy: You don't see Prot and Holy, you see Paladin and Holy. right?
[11:56:54] FergusCreative: ARCANE MAGE GLASS CANON PLEASE
[11:56:55] Bloodhaven08: looks like there is a class tree and your spec tree
[11:56:55] pereadin: Legion shockadin back ?!
[11:56:57] FranciscoTheMage: LOL RESPEC cost
[11:56:58] CrunkyBrewster: Oooh I can play Survival Hunter with a bow maybe???
[11:57:01] Robodope: if theyre gonna do this kind of class/race locking, they'll have to be a lot better with account-wide grinds
[11:57:02] FireEmblemLord: dps prot warrior
[11:57:02] Xsidious: does that mean towelliee new world order coming back?!!
[11:57:03] Zzorski: @Towelliee its class and spec trees... class for utility and spec for specific abilities i bet
[11:57:03] raldrik: I dont think those will exist. There is base and spec, not spec/spec.
[11:57:04] pacificmc1: Where is the Classic Plus Plus at @Towelliee
[11:57:07] foxies_havocing: I am so gonna hybrid my dh to be tanky dpser
[11:57:08] DragonofWolves: They defintely took all the best things from FF14, SWTOR and GW2 and just weaved it ito Dragonllight. Honestly it's good though. Games need to be inspired by others
[11:57:09] MILESkg21: Falll 2023
[11:57:16] szble: time to make threads to get dragon form some help
[11:57:17] Barret: did they say anything about pre purchase?
[11:57:17] mavericks312: there is gonna be more videos with systems later on im calling it
[11:57:18] Weegleman: gatta save the good stuff for blizzcon
[11:57:18] ashwing_: nah bro 2022 for sure bro Kappa
[11:57:18] DeathLV: isnt it now that the specs are still separate, just the core tree is one tree and specs have each their own? (meaning you cant have prot and holy trree at the same time?)
[11:57:19] cappei: @Towelliee The leaker who was 100% right about everything in this reveal said Autumn 2022
[11:57:23] Velashen: Really all tank classes as DPS options would open up a lot for me.
[11:57:24] Kisswani: KEKW
[11:57:24] lilwaldo: LUL
[11:57:24] pacificmc1: Where is the Classic Plus Plus at @Towelliee 🤔
[11:57:24] 91Niki: KEKW
[11:57:25] MILESkg21: Jebaited
[11:57:25] Cboz78: Red Green Blue Bronze
[11:57:26] Mitune: oof cries in Shaman tank
[11:57:26] alex12645: LUL
[11:57:26] fewyn: KEKW
[11:57:27] extrnl2: dont need to give another class all 3 specs though
[11:57:30] abracka_: blizzard do it
[11:57:31] Nildaem: healers are both green and bronze dragonflight
[11:57:34] TSquadSully: that would actually be kinda cool lol
[11:57:34] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee THEY STILL HAVE time to incorporate PLAYER HOUSING.. let's see if they are really listening
[11:57:37] Molvonos: I mean, technically you'd go Black/Bronze for a tank spec.
[11:57:37] lilwaldo: No shot
[11:57:37] Atolanos: @Mitune  RIGHT!? Its all i WANT
[11:57:37] DeanoTV: nahhh
[11:57:37] Mortal_Wombat_: @DragonofWolves thats what blizzard always does best. take from others and imprve. and thats completely fine
[11:57:38] MILESkg21: NO FUCKIN CHANCE
[11:57:39] LoSuns: Lol
[11:57:40] Reznr: That gives them til Dec 21
[11:57:41] DeanoTV: they would have said a date
[11:57:41] kokochris: No way 2022
[11:57:42] Alaquane: they have to save the tank evoker for 11.0
[11:57:42] Ensanee: there is no shot
[11:57:43] Robodope: no shot
[11:57:45] cdk058: the model of the dragon class could be better imo
[11:57:45] nephttv_: He aint wrong tho, I was really wanting a new tank
[11:57:45] Collected1: the expansion is so lacking i can believe it
[11:57:46] Frozen_DK: maybe prepatch in holidays ?
[11:57:47] dutchie76: no way 2022
[11:57:47] ZeusDNA: If it was this fall, they'd have opened pre-orders for sure lol
[11:57:47] CrunkyBrewster: Im mildly disappointed with the look of the dragon race. I want a beefy looking dude
[11:57:48] raye_gaming22: @Towelliee  thats the guy i was talking about
[11:57:51] Krelivane_: The new UI is everything for me
[11:57:52] FostBros: i think they could by end of year
[11:57:52] Sereannon: beta by autumn but no way this releases before 2023
[11:57:53] dwolters_the_zombieman: wow that is big contant drought
[11:57:53] Robodope: wotlk classic in 2022 to buy dragonflight more time
[11:57:54] MILESkg21: 4 months NO WAY
[11:57:54] abracka_: the leaker also said it would be announced back in feb/march, so
[11:57:55] cappei: He was legit CORRECT about everything. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
[11:57:56] RSLucas: No way, they aren't even in alpha yet
[11:57:59] NILLme: wotlk will be autmn 2022
[11:58:00] Nerendis: Honestly right now testing is mostly just Drak
[11:58:00] dutchie76: thats why they announced Wrath Classic
[11:58:00] BoezIRL: I think beta in autumn
[11:58:02] duhworks: if the game is super light than maybe
[11:58:02] Sambhur: I am very surprised that there is no pre order yet
[11:58:02] CrunkyBrewster: oh yeah im hyped for the new UI
[11:58:03] Robodope: aug 2022 for beta maybe
[11:58:06] stasisvoid: autumn for beta maybe, i doubt release tho
[11:58:08] MeisterPetze: maybe reroll my warrio after 17 years?
[11:58:11] 24sevn: feb 2023 is my guess
[11:58:11] raye_gaming22: he said november
[11:58:11] zerkx1: they want to release it sooner because the sub numbers have tanked. that's why it'll release soon
[11:58:12] Soddah: @Towelliee I cant help to feel.. disapointed. Like, at this point, it will be 3 years between Shadowlands and Dragonflight. What is actually new here.. 3 years for ... this? I keep comparing over and over to games like Lost Ark where they pump out in 6 months the amout Blizzard does in 3-4 years. So wierd..
[11:58:12] krayaal: but the leaker was from a year ago right?
[11:58:12] Squintymonk31: maybe, but we are getting wolk classic first this year and there will be time between
[11:58:13] ObamaEnvy: It'll be released in 2022 for sure. No way they wait all the way till 2023.
[11:58:14] pacificmc1: @MilesKG21 Autumn is until Dec 21 but ok
[11:58:15] Atokiri: i like it simple, so they can use timewalking more for raids and dungeons atokir2Hyper
[11:58:15] fewyn: yeah if there isn't a major borred power system
[11:58:16] Xsidious: Does that mean Towelliee New World Order coming back?!!!
[11:58:17] fewyn: maybe
[11:58:21] cappei: @MilesKG21 He specified November 2022
[11:58:22] Atolanos: We have a season 4 coming though .... and 9.2.5 that seems tooooo fast
[11:58:23] Mitune: Beta might come out in Autumn
[11:58:24] literally_human_garbage: That's actually a good point - it may come sooner because there aren't things like Torghast and Covenant abilities and conduits and soulbinds and legendaries to test
[11:58:24] Ravesher: january 2023 at the latest
[11:58:27] Winnie_theBro: New UI is actually hyyypppeee. Almost 20 years without the UI changing is crazy
[11:58:31] CrunkyBrewster: mmhmm
[11:58:32] Reznr: Autumn goes to Dec 21st
[11:58:34] azzurrin: 1st quarter of 2023
[11:58:36] Weegleman: maybe preorder autumn
[11:58:37] TacDuc: I thought they would do a 3 spec, with all 3 different kinds of roles, as dragons especially black dragons seem very tanky(Considering the things we had to do to kill Deathwing)
[11:58:38] azzurrin: maybe second
[11:58:39] zigzugg: @Towelliee i thought the trees were based on spec and class like 1 for class utility and 1 for your current spec. HahaShrugLeft HahaShrugRight
[11:58:40] IianaDRK: im expecting wrath in november, dragonflight early next year
[11:58:40] DeanoTV: feb/march yeah
[11:58:41] Soddah: @Towelliee I cant help to feel.. disapointed. Like, at this point, it will be 3 years between Shadowlands and Dragonflight. What is actually new here.. 3 years for ... this? I keep comparing over and over to games like Lost Ark where they pump out in 6 months the amout Blizzard does in 3-4 years. So wierd...
[11:58:42] Ortinoth: Feb 2023 launch / pre event
[11:58:42] usse00: @Towelliee When do you think we will have pre orders?

[11:58:53] Sereannon: I trust your gut. Wrath Classic in end of 2022 will keep the subs active.
[11:58:54] cranemasterr: I'm cautiously optimistic at this point. i didn't think I'd come back but they reeled me in with a new healer
[11:58:54] Ravesher: another year on 9.2.5 cannot see it

[11:59:23] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Soddah (warning)
[11:59:23] kyshen3: I need to see more information though. seemed like they glazed on everything's
[11:59:24] fakevaltteri: @ArcaneSyntax oh lord
[11:59:25] captivate7: Shadowlands alpha came out in April 2020, Shadowlands came out in November 2020. That was 7 months of testing? So January seems very accurate

[11:59:35] FranciscoTheMage: it wasnt a GIFT? you paid for it?
[11:59:37] CullenPrime: How can they be furry haters? Dragons don't have fur

[12:00:05] Bloodhaven08: Convoke!
[12:00:07] DeanoTV: i cant believe they added new race class AND talent, profession revamps @Towelliee
[12:00:07] IianaDRK: we're basically having 2 talent trees per spec. we have a class one and a spec one
[12:00:08] dreamwalker213: the new talent trees has old systems revamped within differenty builds
[12:00:08] raye_gaming22: vom SL the druid one
[12:00:09] KragnosWoW: @Towelliee taking a break soon? i dont want to miss anything and need to grab food and hit the bathroom LUL
[12:00:09] pacificmc1: Towelliee more like Towelliar KEKW
[12:00:13] azurrei: dragonriding looks cool, I want to know more about talent trees and alt friendly  gearing though - oh, and non-useless crafted gear
[12:00:13] Ortinoth: talent trees was an awesome feature of olden days
[12:00:14] FergusCreative: no more borrowed power?
[12:00:15] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee did they say we going from 60 to 70? or staying 60..
[12:00:15] Kisswani: it's too static in the end tho . what's endgame progression gonna be like ? @Towelliee
[12:00:16] Robodope: well except you get all your "power" when you finish leveling
[12:00:16] Venkxx: I mean, he said so didnt he? THATs the system
[12:00:16] BlockishTiger: exactly. that IS the new system
[12:00:17] Fugazi811: another doom and gloomer post 󠀀
[12:00:18] NILLme: thank god
[12:00:22] cappei: This is the system of the expac. I don't know how people say we aren't getting a new system, it's essentially a new system
[12:00:29] the_general01: most of these people commenting on reddit are people who should have walked away years ago
[12:00:29] TacDuc: @FranciscoTheMage 70
[12:00:31] Molvonos: @Towelliee You think that the talent system will be also an AA system?  Where you can earn more xp beyond max level to fill out more of the tree?
[12:00:33] IianaDRK: new spells
[12:00:34] dutchie76: level 70 is cap
[12:00:35] Mitune: Leveling will feel better as well with being able to place a point each level. Small but nice @Towelliee
[12:00:36] Tzarrus: But that's what we have been asking for for YEARS ...forget the systems and bake it all in to the Talent Tree and let us choose
[12:00:39] Drizz_36: that's huge. i love the idea of being able to have hybrids and more creative builds again
[12:00:41] Kronvig78: The lack of hype, makes me think it might be a good expansion
[12:00:44] BoezIRL: you have the base class and then the specialization. lot's of combination you can do
[12:00:44] Zivs: I saw convoke for druids
[12:00:46] DramaticTv: i just wanna see pre order stuff :P
[12:00:46] Velashen: Yeah I'm down. No more borrowed power will be ideal for sure.
[12:00:48] OGXanos: probably new dragon/elemental shit
[12:00:52] literally_human_garbage: I'm sure we'll have some new things - but maybe we'll know more closer to alpha/beta
[12:00:53] viraloverload: Anything on Season of Mastery??
[12:00:53] DragonofWolves: I honestly think 70 should be the last level cap though
[12:00:59] DeanoTV: we got convoke still HYPERS
[12:01:00] unowncreature: @Towelliee I still want to know how we go from scourge attacking Silvermoon in 9.2.5 to...Dragon Flight expansion...
[12:01:00] FranciscoTheMage: how do we earn progress in talents..  by just levelling ?? @Towelliee
[12:01:02] zerkx1: there is going to be new talents. you can even spot a few in the reveal
[12:01:03] Ravesher: player housing 10.1 or 10.2 100% calling it now
[12:01:05] Grizly922: this could be a raid logging expansion then , idk but i liked the ap grind in legion,/bfa
[12:01:06] DeanoTV: so some covenant spells will be back
[12:01:07] FergusCreative: It looks like a lot of the art team came from WildStar lol
[12:01:13] jekky34: @deanotv really?
[12:01:16] swordart2022: I am telling you no one on reddit plays the game just bunch of haters in echo chamber hating.
[12:01:18] Kisswani: @Towelliee is their anything we saw that looked like an endgame grind ?

[12:01:35] 91Niki: THE CINEMATIC WAS BORING?! I'm sorry wtf...
[12:01:35] KVANNORWICK: The new talent system is closer to what it used to be, and it is very similar to how Guild Wars 2 approaches its abilities.

[12:42:37] LeideGaming: you get to choose your dragon/proto
[12:42:38] gingerbasterd: @towelliee have you seen or heard anything about Drakthyr getting a flight form
[12:42:39] Dyasis: How to train your dragon
[12:42:39] E_mark: It sounded like that 󠀀
[12:42:42] mugwurt: @Towelliee just tuning in, what was your take on the announcements?
[12:42:42] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[12:42:43] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee you can mix colors with different models
[12:42:45] pereadin: The green one is a undercity mount
[12:42:45] fred_birkhoff: that guy said it wrong ... it's snouts not snoots xd @Towelliee
[12:42:45] 91Niki: @Towelliee It's just shapes, you get different colors to the shapes
[12:42:47] yokai_5: they can fix m+ by making a limit of entering weekly , but makes it give more mats / items .
[12:42:51] TheCliffyShow: I like the word snoot.
[12:42:54] Zifahx: where is blue?
[12:42:55] Robodope: probably like platforming-related
[12:42:56] Ortinoth: open world travel
[12:42:59] Brimstar: So, literally gw2 mounts
[12:43:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that would be more about travel, and they said access to some places
[12:43:03] Lifted_ADub: Hey @Towelliee how do you feel about the "item Quality" announcement? sounds like titanforging 2.0 to me unless its just crafting i guess?
[12:43:04] OGXanos: I mean more like a side seat vendor, multi person etc
[12:43:05] scratches16: anyone else notice that all 4 "dragon" models already exist in-game? Vrykul, Dinosaur, Wyvern, classic Drake
[12:43:06] SerJohnPope: Now all we need is How to train your dragon colab and go full Pixar SeemsGood
[12:43:07] Relic7: @yokai_5 That is an awful idea
[12:43:09] Robodope: gw2 mounts good though
[12:43:10] duffluv22: Flying World Boss!!!
[12:43:17] stresstest: Flying Thru LOOPS Dailies
[12:43:20] brilargaming: Pimp my dragon
[12:43:24] chukudu: Avatar taming dragons towPog
[12:43:24] ContraRob: So we got GW2 mounts, FFXIV UI, and WoW/PoE Talent trees. I like it!

[12:43:29] Sadisticmedic: cohhBoop cohhBoop Snoot
[12:43:33] matx83: but do they fly or are they just glorified gliders?
[12:43:34] fred_birkhoff: i might be wrong
[12:43:36] yokai_5: @Relic7 if you prefer to farm all day for your BIS trinkets be my guest
[12:43:38] Alegnowar: calling item upgrades titanforging LUL
[12:43:47] TheWarbringer: I wonder if you can still doing flying whilst also having dragon riding, as they mentioned exhaustion - be annoying if your mount suddenly slows down cause its tired
[12:43:49] moppernyc: There is 100% chance some raid fight incorporates your drake companion. They always do that, like vehicles and flame leviathan.
[12:43:51] PawgersHC: New World mechanics
[12:43:52] Linasha: It’s like the ffxiv system
[12:43:53] pereadin: It’s very LA-esque in a broad sense.
[12:44:01] Pr1m0x21: hyped for the expension?
[12:44:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: These things are not gliders, they really fly and do things
[12:44:14] Lifted_ADub: i mean, if item quality is in raids is what im talking about  like isnt that textbook titanforging lol

[12:45:30] Yagr6: ion did say hybrid
[12:45:33] literally_human_garbage: i think it's smart to have a basic class tree and then a secondary spec tree
[12:45:38] kekwnano: 2H WINDFURY MIGHT BE BACK !!!
[12:45:38] Incredible_Sausage: people are still gonna just copy/paste the "best" builds 󠀀
[12:45:39] Mitune: God I hope so
[12:45:41] Z3ROR: I really hope i can choose the spec i want with the new talent tree, not the spec which gives the most damage. I hope it's balanced more.

[12:49:18] OGXanos: I think the game just can't handle housing at this point
[12:49:20] Mitune: So sorta like what spells make you think paladin they are gonna be in the generic tree but what makes you think holy will be in holy at least it seems @Banka1TV
[12:49:23] kekwnano: @Snabido could make a return with the new talents we can dream

[12:59:05] SeckSymbols: 9.2 was a good start for blizz, Dragonflight seems to be a good stepping stone, what matters now is consistency going forward
[12:59:14] chrslp: Otter gonna be a 0.0001% drop chance mount KEKW
[12:59:21] weaponx69: weaponx69 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[12:59:23] Odinslayer: the fact that there is no pre-order option right now (which is the first time ever there's no pre-order on a reveal day), it means they are way behind and we can see a spring/summer 2023 release
[12:59:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: As long as they do it right, this is putting WoW back in the #1 spot, imo
[12:59:35] lordmyer: It looks it! I will be honest I was tearing up a bit watching cause I was excited
[12:59:36] Rudric_Ice: man that leaker was right again

[13:00:17] lordmyer: Oh can I not reply to threads ?
[13:00:18] chrslp: Average time for announcement to release is 391 days. We're looking at a mid to late 2023
[13:00:26] Noobicron: maybe q3 2023
[13:00:33] MILESkg21: you dont think they will stretch 9.2.5 for 4 months LuL
[13:00:38] sunmech: is the world server down for everyone else?
[13:00:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: @fred_birkhoff The talent trees and how complex they are is a little scary, but I think during beta it can be ironed out
[13:00:45] SeckSymbols: A full year and a half of no major patches? You all are fucking high
[13:00:47] gingerbasterd: I say q2. They said in the announcement “the next year”

[13:04:28] AudioJaq: Keep it out

[13:04:47] KragnosWoW: the 1% should go back to private servers
[13:04:58] SeckSymbols: Classic players gonna bitch when they have to run to Halls of Reflection again
[13:05:00] kickbutt716: @Towelliee when can we preorder it?
[13:05:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath needs LFD, imo
[13:05:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: hopefully you dont need anything from occulus because good luck finding a group LUL
[13:05:11] AudioJaq: If they put it in- and just keep it server Id be ok- but that would make ques crazy long
[13:05:14] KaisenSiru: Classic PepeLaugh
[13:05:19] GameingAspect: were i get my valor points?

[13:05:40] KaisenSiru: TRUE
[13:05:47] Snabido: @MilesKG21 Recipe of how to deplete your keys in 5 minutes
[13:05:48] ijuki: So, in order to play in WOTLK, tank or healer for me then

[13:05:56] MILESkg21: Snabido 4Head
[13:05:59] danimoto10: so towellie do you think we will have more new features reaveled during the wait time? like M+ to old duncgeons?

[13:06:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: An in-game survey when it launches would be ideal, imo
[13:06:29] Hexof: whats wrong with a server only LFG tool
[13:06:38] Cody_Cayde: They going to add more race/class combos in wrath? Like in the original
[13:06:43] Ragevamp666: these people didnt try lfg i wotlk how people just upped and left groups in dungeons
[13:06:48] CardinalTX: Tell Holly this isnt Everquest....add lfg
[13:06:56] xomegaprime: without that it forces you into chat again
[13:07:02] kickbutt716: When can we pre-order it?
[13:07:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, they have time
[13:07:07] kokochris: yup; in Wrath beta they will put it back in
[13:07:14] darssia_: at launch ok sure dont have it but a month or two in? no way.
[13:07:28] ijuki: Holinka and Dan iirc
[13:07:40] BENJII_TK: i think wrath lfg didn't come till later patch didn't it?
[13:07:52] Dinosew: can't believe there wont be a tank spec
[13:07:54] Daveybutter: blizz will cave to the no lfd quick
[13:07:54] KragnosWoW: feel like weve seen everything that was supposed to be seen today, now we wait for interviews to slowly come out
[13:08:03] lithium364: so it will be broken kekw
[13:08:06] xomegaprime: the movie it was always a chat add-on
[13:08:09] bob_the_demon: I would assume pre-order will be around the time 9.2.5 comes out
[13:08:23] MILESkg21: Charge like LA
[13:08:28] KragnosWoW: LFG will help people meet new people they wouldnt have normally found, idk why theyd remove it
[13:08:31] Siven80: i dont think empowered spells will make it live tbh
[13:08:48] xomegaprime: I mean lfg is a chat add-on
[13:09:01] Nokterian: @Towelliee the dragonflight is totally from GW2 and that is good
[13:09:02] bob_the_demon: The fact that there isn't a pre-order is telling that the timeline for release is ~a year away
[13:09:03] Kinghorn: they just dont want to get it working LUL 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[13:09:08] malthus1: is additional appearance options on the table?

[13:09:17] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[13:09:18] Amarlian: I think, they should split servers. some with it off and some with it on
[13:09:24] Shearkahn: My opinion as long as you dont make it ross server then your fine. s
[13:09:26] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Radiag (warning)
[13:09:29] Coldfire989: You forgot a classic
[13:09:34] TheCliffyShow: I'm doing LFR Jailer, and oh my god. It's a train wreck if the train was full of puppies.
[13:09:36] MILESkg21: do a dungeon and not say one thing grps KEKW
[13:09:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: True

[13:10:37] Splitloop: i like how all wow has to do to get everyone to come back and give them attention is release more garbage.

[13:37:02] Voramir: is there a way to do targeted loot? like increasing odds that personal loot gives what you're looking for
[13:37:15] Nibbel__: Wowhead have a preview on new race animations
[13:37:16] cruzeal: druid PogChamp
[13:37:23] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u are still at presentaion mode
[13:37:24] Voramir: like bonus tokens-ish
[13:37:30] Squirrel_nutty: swap scenes Towelliee your on the wrong mode
[13:37:43] CYNIC308: NOHITJEROME had a really good point that acheevs in classic should be counting and forwarding into retail but they're not and its wrong!
[13:37:46] MILESkg21: !SCENE
[13:37:49] PvtHudson093: Swap scens dude
[13:37:54] Rudric_Ice: man i was hoping for a pre-order today
[13:38:04] pereadin: Tokens are bottom left
[13:38:14] Sadisticmedic: @91Niki I just signed up for Beta
[13:38:16] pereadin: Next to the ZM epic gear resource
[13:38:17] FergusCreative: I dont appreciate there being no full skip for ZM though
[13:38:26] Theduskflyer: Sure, you just invite players to you me guild, but then it’s sever based. No off server people can join guilds. It mitigates it a little bit.
[13:38:37] mitchumtx: Just wanna see what the pre-order bonus will be this xpac Last pre-order we got what....A Mount, 30 Days Gametime, Transmog, 50 Boost, Pet and a weapon cosmetic?
[13:38:41] 91Niki: @Sadisticmedic Same :D
[13:38:46] samanthacake26: whats up
[13:39:06] mitchumtx: nah thats what we got last xpac
[13:39:12] tommysavagex: New class for preoder maybe? they did that with dh
[13:39:12] xxsargexx: @Sadisticmedic the only beta ive ever gotten into was vanilla ive never gotten into any beta since then so i wont even try LUL
[13:39:18] MILESkg21: NEW CAP IS 70 so why not
[13:39:31] dalvynthedrunk: I am excited for Dragonflight! Tho Ill be honest the straight up yoink of gw2s mount is pretty funny
[13:39:49] tommysavagex: @dalvynthedrunk gw has the best mount system tho
[13:39:56] mitchumtx: you didnt read what i wrote...Thats what we got for Shadowlands
[13:40:05] Velashen: Its just going to leave regular flying feeling like poop.
[13:40:06] Rexialiton: and completely allowed
[13:40:06] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[13:40:08] Sadisticmedic: @xxsargexx I was in the BFA beta and the End of Shawdowlands Beta
[13:40:14] tydrennistv: Demon Hunter mains feel threatened now
[13:40:15] maybe_torq: I mean, wow was just a better EQ at one  point
[13:40:20] FergusCreative: Maybe preorder in may with mobile game announcement
[13:40:26] fred_birkhoff: yeah, that's not new, they've been yoinking stuff since TBC. zangarmarsh is a whole area stolen from the elder scrolls morrowind
[13:40:32] dalvynthedrunk: I mean I don't care if it feels half as good as Gw2s griffon it wikll be an awesome feature
[13:40:45] zeiours: @towelliee I really hope they don’t end up going back up to level 120 in so could of years time. We need some type of ESO end levelling system..
[13:40:55] KizaruGR: I am extremely hyped for the expansion BUT that dragon race looks cheesy
[13:41:03] ScottyNoNose: server thing was more about getting hardware i hope, I saw somehwere that blizzard doesnt even own the majorty of the hardware
[13:41:09] Kinghorn: we do but people still gonna bitch 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[13:41:10] Taz_85: It' s funny cuz the dragon mounts in GW2 are the ''helicopter'' of the mounts. It's the gryphon that does the kind of flying the WoW dragons will do
[13:41:13] dalvynthedrunk: Guessing no influencer interviews or anything,w as hoping for some nitty gritty questions like how many dungeons, etrc
[13:41:17] infinityarty: cant wait to come home every day and looking for my beta invite but never getting one FeelsBadMan
[13:41:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: have to take the new class to BWL to see the nefarian class call LUL

[13:42:04] tydrennistv: Do you think envoker are going to be easy like dh?
[13:42:07] Theduskflyer: Hopefully alpha isn’t just big streamers. Hopefully some of the smaller ones get in too, abs get keys to hand out.
[13:42:09] JarJar_Brinkz: Comes out next week
[13:42:20] TSquadSully: big year for wow
[13:42:24] Teknofear64: I wonder if any more toon spots with a new class?
[13:42:28] PawgersHC: Wrath in December?
[13:42:29] AlexxCri: I honestly think it will be second half of 2023
[13:42:33] Theduskflyer: Plus, we get to watch Asmon climb mountains.
[13:42:34] KizaruGR: @velashen First thing I did after I finished work was check the reveal and when I saw the new race I was like "What the hell is this" xD Not negative about it though. It's not wow visually
[13:42:38] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee Ok So the Dragons Isle is happening. The Dragons protect Azeroth. I have a feelijng a battle against the Old Gods will gappen
[13:42:42] Rudric_Ice: i kinda hate that dracthyr males had to be elves again like why
[13:42:42] reinhardtdog: Not even a preorder yet
[13:42:45] dirtylurker69: We didnt even get preorders so far LUL

[13:42:47] tydrennistv: I’m hoping feb or 2023
[13:42:49] RageQTT: I wonder if they are gonna make crafted gear actually on the same level as PvE/PvP gear. Dont think I would mind that tbh
[13:42:53] mitchumtx: Pre-Order in May when they announce Mobile Game?
[13:42:56] tydrennistv: Maybe week of Valentine’s Day
[13:42:56] MILESkg21: Wrath in OCT NOV ish

[13:43:44] kokochris: towBlind
[13:43:47] mitchumtx: Whatcha think it'll be Towelliee? Something like Warcraft Strategy? or you think they will copy Raid Shadow Legends?
[13:43:56] MrPodio: They are just mad they arent the ones getting ivited lmao
[13:43:58] JarJar_Brinkz: Dont notice cuz they dont watch small streamers, which is why its strange to bring up the point LUL
[13:44:02] infinityarty: well there goes the super duper secret
[13:44:05] fred_birkhoff: your bear guy looks like a tauren demon hunter

[13:45:22] gregl__: @GhettoKoolAid if you owned a business you wouldnt be saying the same thing
[13:45:25] germanos1x: is there gonna be a new ''covenant system?''
[13:45:26] JarJar_Brinkz: Everyone has an equal chance after first alpha

[13:51:59] pereadin: They’re just doing negative healing
[13:52:06] darthvapor420: I loved seeing blizz get knocked TF out in the past year or two. But I'm also just as excited to see them build themselves back up
[13:52:16] FergusCreative: The people still butt hurt that wildstart is dead
[13:52:18] JarJar_Brinkz: Definitely that

[13:53:47] Ortinoth: only thing from the announcement that i didn't like was have to level again -
[13:53:47] Vch001: So how many determination stacks?
[13:53:49] Durk101: its not bad they are trying to fix their image, just something to be mindful of, if they end up coming through on all of their changes in culture and design philosophy the industry as a whole will be better for it
[13:53:51] Tobeskee: cant believe i let my sub lapse BibleThump  my bad @Towelliee
[13:53:51] tommysavagex: the profession rehaul is hype

[13:54:04] Ahlstr0m_: Do you think they'll add faction change in wotlk classic?
[13:54:06] jsyk9201: is november release for dragonflight true?
[13:54:06] mavericks312: instead of 12 this time it will be 200
[13:54:07] Wcvechten: They could just resquish it later again
[13:54:08] darthvapor420: i really would have loved all end game zones as opposed to leveling
[13:54:11] Swocky: HJope is the last thing that leaves humans but cmon how many chanses have Blizzard gotten?

[13:54:20] Rudric_Ice: only thing i didn't like was dragon race males had to elves like why why can't i be a human or a tauren
[13:54:21] edingt0n: Can maybe solo BFA raids pretty easy also at 70
[13:54:31] duffluv22: Those dragon legs got me not hyped though...lmao!!!!

[13:54:45] WundertueteGER: yes 󠀀 󠀀
[13:54:45] MILESkg21: it made me cry when the guy fell though BibleThump
[13:54:45] robertjordan83: cinematic was pretty weak

[13:54:52] Puppette: I really like the cinematic
[13:54:52] Velashen: @duffluv22 Scaly chicken legs?

[13:54:56] Rudric_Ice: i liked it
[13:54:57] SoloImperius: idk i really liked it
[13:55:00] FergusCreative: its a metaphor for blizzard being asleep at the wheel and slow to change lol
[13:55:00] WundertueteGER: weakest cinematic of all expansion so far
[13:55:04] jsyk9201: @jsyk9201 max said that towelliee said november release date
[13:55:08] MetalManGG: I think they tried to go for the MoP vibe, but at least on the MoP cinematic there was some action
[13:55:08] HaloS23: @Towelliee It was really refreshing to hear that "we made a mistake going away from original talent trees, and that created a large whole we had to fill". So really to me this almost seems like a Homecoming!!!! Im Hyped!!!!
[13:55:08] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[13:55:10] ContraRob: It was a good cinematic, not great for an announcement cinematic. Was in the vein of the Old Soldier ones, because it told a cool story
[13:55:17] duffluv22: @velashen exactly!!!! lol
[13:55:18] Theduskflyer: You mean Stoney Tony!?!?
[13:55:19] TSquadSully: i actually clapped when the dragons flew in lol

[13:55:23] Mahal_11532: Mahal_11532 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[13:55:32] Kisswani: Watching the cinematic a second time felt better than the first time . coz now you can focus on the details
[13:55:32] Ealdfox: Stoney Tony is awesome
[13:55:34] Rakim88: more content for xvideos u mean Hmm rock dude slamming alex
[13:55:34] byrdeen45: but can dracthyr only play a evoker or can it play otehr classes?
[13:55:41] PawgersHC: Did they explain going from Shadowlands to Dragonworld?
[13:55:46] Drizz_36: better late than never
[13:55:50] HaloS23: better late than never!
[13:55:55] darthvapor420: I'd rather the cinimatic be the low point of an expac than the high one *cough* shadowlands* *cough*
[13:55:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: @byrdeen45 only evoker
[13:55:59] BIGxTPx23: @byrdeen45 only each other

[13:56:16] TigasLIVE: Its true tho
[13:56:27] valianya: I liked that watcher, he's got character.  I was so upset when he started breaking as he pulled the beacon together cuz I thought they were gonna kill him off after introducing him.
[13:56:29] Velashen: He is right though.
[13:56:58] michaelmm: Once the prued the basline bloat in after Wod - it left classes feeling hollowed out without the addon systems. We just nevr noticed till they took the legion weapons away.
[13:56:59] darthvapor420: Stoney Danza is the Manza of the whole cinematic
[13:56:59] cruzeal: that's cool double bear
[13:57:01] Rudric_Ice: dracathyr can only be elves ? cuz im not a big elf guy
[13:57:05] SilkeySmooth: blizzard keeped the same talent system for years because they were to lazy.
[13:57:23] MILESkg21: Evoker Healer MAINS RISE UP
[13:57:25] Zerfell: That watcher got more plot development then zovaal for all of SL
[13:57:38] ijuki: @mileskg21 towHAMUP
[13:58:13] fred_birkhoff: truth
[13:58:20] MILESkg21: Complacency
[13:58:23] enux337: activision locking him down?
[13:58:34] Velashen: He totally pooped on the old talent system. He was right, but you do make a good point. Could have been fixed long ago.
[13:58:36] michaelmm: Maybe it just took so long for them to figure a betetr way out of the hole they dug?
[13:58:48] urextinct: Because of  Microsoft 😂
[13:59:14] Bulgogiprince: Didn't Ion say that one of the reasons that he started looking back at the Talent systems was the response that people were giving to the classic versions
[13:59:20] FergusCreative: @urextinct yup I can see it now this releases after Microsoft acquisition and they get all the credit
[13:59:25] duffluv22: chicken legged dragons...omg
[13:59:25] michaelmm: As the lead Ion can only work with what his team comes up with at the end of the day. He's not able to design the whole game himself solo.
[13:59:27] bob_the_demon: Haven't they said something similar about systems "filling the gasp" before though?
[13:59:27] cranjismcbasketball069: not everything its Activisions fault
[13:59:59] BlueBlurPrime: I was out at work do you have a reveal video with your reaction I can watch?
[14:00:10] enux337: maybe pressure for going beyond wotlk
[14:00:18] akia03: its funny people want the new race but not play as dragons
[14:00:25] Rudric_Ice: dracathyr's needs to be more beefier need more muscles they are lacking in that part
[14:00:28] valianya: watcher's got real grit.  all his friends dead and he was ok with dying to call the dragons home, he accepted he was about to die, but was at peace cuz he accomplished his goal
[14:00:30] nightmayor12: interesting that flying is one of their huge features this expac
[14:00:35] Velashen: Now that they won't be reinventing the wheel every expansion maybe patches and new content will come faster w/ better quality.
[14:00:48] MILESkg21: im more shocked they did Class and Spec trees
[14:01:00] TheCliffyShow: I hope rogues get flaggellation in their tree.
[14:01:12] cranjismcbasketball069: I do think it's true that the game had a power creep issue from expansions compounding new spells onto each other from classic to cata.
[14:01:12] pereadin: You think talent system will be a 35/35 split?
[14:01:13] Voramir: the real question...am I gonna be a dragon riding a dragon?
[14:01:24] valianya: they can just add more talents to the trees with new expacs in future
[14:01:51] pereadin: Oh yeah that makes more sense. Big true.
[14:01:53] Ortinoth: should be 60 points
[14:01:56] UltraKSlaya: does the new flying system work with other mounts??

[14:09:07] Venasmat: Don't forget the need for a BL class in M+

[14:09:42] RaysFTW: I like them :)
[14:09:51] abracka_: 100% meme
[14:09:57] CYNIC308: their wings are to small and their feet are to big and they probably walk super dumb like the old wogen walk! LUL
[14:10:00] SilkeySmooth: im so glad thee was no tinker
[14:10:00] mavericks312: tinkerer is a meme thats never happening
[14:10:03] UltraKSlaya: they should make reputation account wide, if they want more class representation
[14:10:03] Boltbert: summoning Teriz
[14:10:04] mizerboy: @Towelliee  - so now that the reveeal is out....how much of that did you know ahead of time?

[14:10:22] abracka_: honestly wondering though if they'll add a tank spec to that new class over alpha/beta
[14:10:24] pereadin: Tinkerers = bombs = survival. We already have a tinker class KEKW
[14:10:28] bob_the_demon: Tinkers in 20.0 confirmed
[14:10:30] Rudric_Ice: they need to work on the dracathyr models a bit tbh needs to be beefier

[14:10:41] SilkeySmooth: if you want an tinker play gw2
[14:10:47] DuransHybrid: I wonder if you can use other mounts in dragon isles or if the flying mechanics will be universal reguardless of location/mount
[14:10:47] CYNIC308: PANDAS were a meme LUL
[14:10:51] Theduskflyer: Tinker is a new profession

[14:11:56] BlueBeast33: Professions too I hope
[14:11:58] darthvapor420: im down like brown for that baby
[14:11:58] abracka_: wonder what the monk/demon hunter talent tree will look like since they never have the traditional talent trees
[14:12:11] jskillz777: bringing player power back
[14:12:11] akia03: so in 10.3 it will be good :)
[14:12:13] fewyn: since it's not some kind of complicated system it might mean a shorter beta cycle maybe?
[14:12:14] SingaHulk: Worth playing before the expansion drops?
[14:12:15] TiredCarcass: tinkers pfft
[14:12:29] merzicdh: make sure to stretch before all that reaching
[14:12:40] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee I just hope, hope, hope they stick to talent trees so they can focus on other stuff for the next expansions.

[14:14:47] TiredCarcass: i wont miss the maw
[14:14:48] Roadhouse5: pvp with revamped talents trees?
[14:14:50] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee revamped talent trees means pruning?
[14:14:52] Hjolt: just imagine all the balancing that has to be done for encounters
[14:14:53] filipebar: its official, Dragonflight will be the greatest expansion ever for one reason and one reason only..... DUCKS! Wow will FINALLY have DUCKS!
[14:15:05] MeisterPetze: rextroy already broke anyhting

[14:15:10] ItsBorland: :)
[14:15:12] banditrox12: is evoker only going to be on the new race?
[14:15:17] odysseus1: maybe easier to maintain once balance is found though
[14:15:20] JoeyBagadonuts: yup, Rextroy sees those huge talent trees and starts salivating
[14:15:20] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee Pally in WOW can have a Lost ark Spec. Damgage / Support

[14:15:29] raldrik: It looked like their was class+spec tree. Nothing that shows spec+spec so no holy + prot
[14:15:33] Rudric_Ice: did you know about the new race tow ?
[14:15:34] 3dRes: DUCKS?!?! duckD
[14:15:38] Hjolt: its monumental, honestly. it's like doing it all from almost scratch. making sure each spec has equal to 1 of power diverted into different paths
[14:15:41] Bacanu34: Marksman hunt with pets KEKW

[14:16:25] filipebar: @3dRes yes there will FINALLY be ducks greatest expansion ever
[14:16:27] Theduskflyer: How broken will the new hero class be?? Lol
[14:16:30] Hellizzy: They’re doing exactly what most of the community wanted: a simple expansion
[14:16:40] Rudric_Ice: new race with one class is a big BALLSY move
[14:16:48] Hjolt: im however afraid of how far into the furry territory wow has gone. first worgens, now this Kappa
[14:16:58] smashwow: @Theduskflyer it does a fly by shooting Kappa
[14:17:02] Ortinoth: it wasn't to bad
[14:17:04] MILESkg21: they always make the new thing OP AF
[14:17:12] vadder_fister: monk and dk were worse
[14:17:12] Kooznik: they werent OP, they were good tho
[14:17:14] smashwow: idk DH was pretty broken in pvp
[14:17:14] cranjismcbasketball069: Demon Hunter was fine iirc
[14:17:18] lekkahdh: Tanks were a bit broken right, but the dps wasn't all that bad ?
[14:17:20] fistofnature: dps dh was like a blood dk
[14:17:21] XugieXugo: I doubt it will be broken like DK was in wrath prior to ulduar release
[14:17:23] MetalManGG: DH was great during NH and ToS but not OP
[14:17:26] mavericks312: death knights on the other hand
[14:17:28] lekkahdh: DK dps was NUTS
[14:17:29] smashwow: like not DK broken but yeah
[14:17:38] st3ts0n98: if there isnt a Duck mount imma riot
[14:17:40] Pink_Cassie: DK's were super OP at the beginning
[14:17:41] viraloverload: what about season of mastery?
[14:17:46] XugieXugo: frost/unholy builds were the best
[14:17:46] Hjolt: i still miss icy touch :/
[14:17:58] Ortinoth: @viraloverload don't care about classic
[14:18:15] Demontemplar: I don't know how they will balance talent trees when they can't balance 15 talents
[14:18:23] Ortinoth: just woltk classic is coming this year
[14:18:34] TheCliffyShow: I wish they gave the dragons other classes. A black dragon warrior would be awesome. Or black dragon warlock.
[14:18:35] Demontemplar: i feel like this will be just cookie templates but at least you can toggle between them
[14:18:42] RageQTT: Still kinda hoping for class skins in the future
[14:18:55] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee Destroyer is in May
[14:19:00] Ortinoth: @Demontemplar you will always have a cookie cutter meta build with any talent system
[14:19:16] MILESkg21: DESTROYER MAY POGGERS

[14:21:55] Rudric_Ice: they might later
[14:22:02] Bacanu34: any news on pre order ?
[14:22:06] Theduskflyer: Hopefully we get some new proto-drakes
[14:22:07] cranjismcbasketball069: it's an experiment
[14:22:16] Taz_85: Kinda seems like they didn't even need to add the ''Evoker''. Just make it so the race and class are one in the same.
[14:22:19] felinesanonymous: So when is prepatch coming to tbc for wotlk do we have a date
[14:22:26] tomcruise210: man i cant wait to play wrath and retail
[14:23:00] Ceriwyn: New hero class has 3 specs, still stuck DH with only 2. :(
[14:23:13] felinesanonymous: Neither can I. I’ll be going for realm first 80..

[14:23:36] Ceriwyn: 2 dps 1 heal was what I heard
[14:23:39] pavepawns: evoker is 2 specs
[14:23:41] Taz_85: Kite tank! Let's make that meta happen
[14:23:41] MrTerkyMan: DH = MDPS and Tank Evoker = RDPS and Healer They balance each other
[14:23:43] Merex760: It is 2. Ranged dps and healer
[14:23:46] darssia_: 2 dps what
[14:23:47] shenoz: official website mentions only 2 specs
[14:23:48] Voramir: tank inc by popular demand, likely later
[14:23:50] jkitchin75: what the hell is an evoker
[14:23:51] Tyrou: 2 dps specs and 1 healer spec
[14:23:56] Syrreall_: only 2 - people got confused by some phrasing
[14:24:01] Taz_85: There's only one dps spec.
[14:24:02] Frostyjoneslol: It has 2 anybody saying 3 got confused fro mthe guy in the deep dive wording a sentance funny
[14:24:04] pavepawns: tyrou stop lying
[14:24:06] Molvonos: Uh, where are you getting two dps specs from, Tyrou?
[14:24:08] ZeusDNA: Preservation and Devastation spec for Evoker
[14:24:17] Rulem: check the Dragonflight main page; its 2 specs.  The dude just explained it really weird
[14:24:27] ViP3R1988: its healer or dps ranged
[14:24:28] PawgersHC: 1 dps spec using 2 dragonflights (red and blue) and 1 healer using 2 dragonflights ( green and bronze)
[14:24:30] saltyohm: Nah it has 6 specs duh
[14:24:32] ViP3R1988: thats it
[14:24:35] felinesanonymous: @towelliee excited for wotlk or nah
[14:24:41] Snabido: Prolly thinking red and blue power as 2 different specs got em confused
[14:24:45] siimon322: call +45 52 42 82 10
[14:24:45] MILESkg21: https://dragonflight.blizzard.com/en-us/ RIGHT HERE
[14:24:48] ZStryker: 3 red is aoe blue was st and green was heals
[14:24:58] Ooshraxa: First ranged dps spec since 2004! Yay!
[14:25:10] Molvonos: Ya'll trollin' bad now.  goodness.
[14:25:11] Taz_85: Also cool that some of the dps spec's attacks are gonna involve its claws for mid-range shit, apparently. I always wish the worgen had that.
[14:25:12] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[14:25:12] Rulem: yep
[14:25:16] Merex760: sadly, yes
[14:25:18] Taz_85: Like a worgen racial claw attack or something.
[14:25:33] Buckwink: yeah they seem badass
[14:25:36] Rulem: first ranged since classic; we are back to a net 0 for ranged, though!
[14:25:36] Merex760: There have been 3 tanks, 3 mdps, 1 healer, no rdps added since WoW release
[14:25:48] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee yep! they removed a ranged spec, so we're actually at net 0 ranged specs.
[14:25:48] Buckwink: so they will use only claw weapons?
[14:25:48] j_hooligan: It’s enrage is azeroths health it slowly goes down
[14:25:53] dyslexican1: I was hyped for Dragon race, but i wont lie, i HATE classes tied to races. I wanted a dragon warrior so bad.
[14:25:54] TurtleThePunnyRabbit: I'm still a little confused as to why the Red Dragon Magic is tied to destruction instead of Preservation.
[14:25:57] cranjismcbasketball069: I hate the models but the playstyle looks cool
[14:25:58] RageQTT: If the charge skills turn out good and feel nice they might carry over to other specs
[14:26:00] TheCheeseWheel87: It's like Ele Blast but cooler
[14:26:05] MILESkg21: nope
[14:26:07] madmannyyz: kinda wanted a dragon knight but whateves lol
[14:26:10] SirSquaggles: nope 󠀀 󠀀
[14:26:13] fewyn: i didn't see them with any weapons
[14:26:18] mavericks312: id guess maybe polearms
[14:26:19] BoezIRL: staff?
[14:26:20] gooni_coyg: staff i guess :D
[14:26:20] dutchie76: probably staffs
[14:26:21] Fawcheddar: they're casters so
[14:26:22] pereadin: InB4 someone says that’s lazy graphical design so they didn’t have to create new animations per cast.
[14:26:23] haderdaraide: claws
[14:26:23] dyslexican1: it was the only let down of any of it for me..
[14:26:26] haderdaraide: i bet claws
[14:26:29] SirSquaggles: that'd make sense yeah
[14:26:35] Taz_85: Yeah, they're using their claws
[14:26:36] XugieXugo: I would imagine staffs M/O and maybe polearms would be a nice touch
[14:26:41] DarkPsyanide: i just resubbed to WoW
[14:26:41] Sluggin1: Dragonshite
[14:26:48] Snabido: Any evoker mains here that knows Kappa
[14:26:59] Throkkz: claws are melee though?

[14:27:44] MetalJoshP: New talent system is big W of the expansion I think
[14:27:44] c0mmander_starscream: No enough for me to resub
[14:27:45] SilkeySmooth: you still got like 8 more month of shadowlands..lol
[14:27:47] TheCliffyShow: Anyone else think, some of the Dragon Isles buildings have a strong anicent Greek feel?
[14:28:07] jkitchin75: @TheCliffyShow it all did
[14:28:17] Taz_85: Yeah, those watchers are definitely greek god-style
[14:28:26] Ooshraxa: if they use claws, they... theoretically could use the same weapon for both specs? Or do INT-based claw weapons work differently?
[14:28:27] c0mmander_starscream: Did Blizz give a release date?
[14:28:41] Rudric_Ice: wait the new race males are ELVES !!!!! again
[14:29:08] fred_birkhoff: no dude, they're dragons @Rudric_Ice
[14:29:11] Theduskflyer: Change to Ret spec for the mace!
[14:29:17] TheCliffyShow: @Rudric_Ice We don't know how extensive the character creation is for them.
[14:29:26] st3ts0n98: @Rudric_Ice pretty sure you get to choose your humanoid race
[14:29:43] fred_birkhoff: the humanoid race is probably gonna be like worgen
[14:29:52] enux337: mom i beat the game
[14:29:54] Rudric_Ice: @st3ts0n98 i hope so
[14:30:13] jkitchin75: i got a 254 mace for doing 5 tw dungs
[14:30:21] QQuuaarrzz: yep titan wathers it was said
[14:30:23] HaloS23: @Towelliee the broken one on the throne was Tyr!
[14:30:25] Taz_85: Yeah I was wondering if that's how all watchers in WoW are. Slow moving and stuff, but maybe those are just some old school, neglected ones
[14:30:33] Snabido: Getting all kinds of titan keepers from various real world inspirations
[14:30:34] Arocian: Will Magni be back?
[14:30:40] Taz_85: Like I didn't think Thorim and those guys were all like that
[14:30:52] Arocian: haha
[14:30:53] Kavieonn: Who is the boss of the new expansion?
[14:30:56] Rudric_Ice: he might be lol
[14:30:58] SirSquaggles: If I had to take a guess, the island is probably NE of Kul Tiras? 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[14:30:59] MILESkg21: not MAGNI but BRANN Kappa
[14:31:01] ilikeblonde5: Champion! a dragon outpost need Yer help LUL
[14:31:02] SilkeySmooth: i like the prehistoric land before time feel dragon isles gives off
[14:31:04] Voramir: bran
[14:31:10] TheCliffyShow: With the Explorer's League in the game we might see the best Bronzebeard, Brann.
[14:31:15] jkitchin75: were is the shit wizard
[14:31:17] Uputz: BUT WE NEED TO HEAL HER WOUNDS!!!
[14:31:19] Cal_Kat: but champion, the WOOONS!
[14:31:20] ilikeblonde5: NotLikeThis i'll be like nope im out
[14:31:25] fred_birkhoff: mankirk's wife @Kavieonn
[14:31:29] MILESkg21: FUCK THEM WOUNDS KEKW
[14:31:34] pavepawns: Dragon isles... a northern isle on Azeroth... *Banging on the door* DID SOMEBODY MENTION AZEROTH? I NEED TO HEAL HER WOUNDS
[14:31:37] Snabido: Nesingwary hunting dragons monkaS
[14:31:39] ilikeblonde5: bahha the woons LUL
[14:31:40] SirSquaggles: "Use your Aspect Power to heal her WOONS!"
[14:31:47] astreinoid: maybe even haris pilton
[14:31:47] PawgersHC: Make arecheology great again
[14:31:49] Ortinoth: if they keep the system simple and back to the roots of the game i could see alot of players pplaying again
[14:31:50] Molehj: "Lets hunt some dragons!" - Nesingwary
[14:31:52] Kavieonn: Shadowlands was one of the best expansions
[14:31:55] Rudric_Ice: which zone was your fav tow ?
[14:32:14] TheCliffyShow: Hemet Nesingwary? Oh, balls. Anicent land not seen for thousands of years, and that asshole is gonna shoot everything on it.
[14:32:18] jkitchin75: @Kavieonn are you on crack
[14:32:20] StraightErro: @Towelliee they did say all the stone dudes were titan watchers, the one on the throne was called Tyr, which is on similar rank with Loki, Thorim, Freya, and all the Ulduar folk like
[14:32:23] Rudric_Ice: i loved the snowy area
[14:32:25] Taz_85: And it's funny, they retconned it again. You thought that centaurs came from Maraudon first? WRONG AGAIN!
[14:32:25] Short_Film: I thought the dragons gave up their powers and became mortal?
[14:32:28] tstormdk: towNecro
[14:32:35] Ispintowin: i cant wait for dragonflight now
[14:32:38] Uputz: Are we done with the AP system?
[14:32:41] astreinoid: kill 30 of each dragon flight
[14:32:44] toyturtlesruwu: question for you and chat? I need a new gaming computer..is OMEN a good gamer computer or avoid them for a new computer?
[14:32:45] Kavieonn: @Kavieonn Why do you say that?
[14:32:46] xReadyAimMissx: @Kavieonn are people not allowed to like what they want? I loved MoP, but tons didn't. burkeShrug
[14:32:53] MILESkg21: this is 10k years BEFORE DEATHWING
[14:33:00] Rulem: yep! back to cata and before
[14:33:02] cosmothug: @Towelliee dont look at the wow subreddit unless you want to lose faith in humanity
[14:33:02] Snabido: @Short_Film Guess they thought "fuck all that, mortals are trash at it, lets do it again"
[14:33:05] SilkeySmooth: why no pre order yet?
[14:33:13] lekkahdh: YES, simplicity SeemsGood
[14:33:21] gooni_coyg: Devastation Evoker ftw :D
[14:33:22] chubahi: TRUE
[14:33:29] MILESkg21: true sadge
[14:33:29] fred_birkhoff: ugh
[14:33:30] NullWolf: I'm a bit hype for the crafting orders. pokketMmmYea
[14:33:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it's a win and it's going to sell well and it's going to bring people back and keep them
[14:33:40] toyturtlesruwu: original talent tree is nice, you actually had individual builds
[14:33:43] SirSquaggles: Like me peepoHappy I started in MoP 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[14:33:45] Molehj: fuck dem kids

[14:33:49] Rulem: I am definitely excited for no major system; I bet they make zone systems similar to zereth mortis, though
[14:33:59] kurlook: The talent tree announcement actually made me the most excited.  I miss the old way of mixing and matching to min/max specs
[14:34:08] MILESkg21: KEKW
[14:34:10] miguelapple: final what?
[14:34:11] Papsvol07: what's your opinion for the new race/class?
[14:34:13] vadder_fister: KEKW
[14:34:13] Buckwink: asmongolds chat is full of nonwow andys
[14:34:15] fred_birkhoff: same here @kurlook
[14:34:16] Rexialiton: KEKW
[14:34:16] TurtleThePunnyRabbit: My only complaint so far is that I feel like they should have given us back all three of the specialization trees instead of choose one.
[14:34:22] nightmayor12: I wonder if he liked the reveal
[14:34:22] Taz_85: I'm actually a little excited to see how I can make my bear druid a little more dangerous and less thrash-spam, if possible
[14:34:24] MILESkg21: no more CHOCOBO RACES KEKW
[14:34:26] paindodo: Lallafun
[14:34:29] Dogjah: They said the talent tree was in Pandaria but I  swear it switched half way through CAT?
[14:34:30] MeisterPetze: haters can suck on those chickens
[14:34:39] Rulem: they totally ripped GW2 mounts, though!  I'm good with it, since its really fun
[14:34:45] wowplaya4ever: lol poor asmondgold fans
[14:34:46] Kindosar: they mean no innovation, just classic trees
[14:34:46] fred_birkhoff: it switched at the end of cata @cmonseriously
[14:34:47] Merex760: There are specialization trees lol. It says it
[14:34:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looked like there will be a tree for each spec and a general tree
[14:34:48] mulaaa_2x: when is the 9 to five challenge start
[14:34:48] NullWolf: I like that I'll be able to order soulbound gear that I can't craft, for my transmogs. :D
[14:34:49] mavericks312: the one you choose is the spec your playing
[14:34:51] atamala: in BC you could put points in all 3 trees I think
[14:35:02] chalichok: Man i really hope that this expansion will succeed but because we r talking for BLIZZARD they will find a WAY to ruin themselves
[14:35:04] swordart2022: Yes you do.
[14:35:04] raldrik: you choose spec, but the talent tree doesnt cross specs. Cannot have a marksman + BM hunter hybrid
[14:35:05] Merex760: You have a general class tree that's shared, then a specialization tree. Two trees
[14:35:07] garkhyt: You can choose hybrid, that's what Ion said
[14:35:08] raye_gaming22: your spec and one "druid" tree for all 3 specs
[14:35:09] TurtleThePunnyRabbit: I meant letting you fan points out into the trees instead of hard locking you into the spec tree.
[14:35:10] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee I wonder if they'll nerf the Necrolord Hearth Kidneystone soulbind trait to only work in Shadowlands. Otherwise it'd be natural to stick to Necrolord for the extra HS in Dragonflight...
[14:35:14] SilkeySmooth: they did you get 3 spec trees and one general tree,
[14:35:18] Velashen: Asmon will find things to hate on. He and bellular make a cute couple.
[14:35:18] raye_gaming22: he wants old 3 trees to pick from
[14:35:20] Snabido: @cmonseriously Cata still had classic trees, but 3/3 instead of 5/5 points. And you had to pick a tree, fill it up to a certain amount and then fill other trees if wanted
[14:35:20] garkhyt: i.e. frost fire for mages, etc
[14:35:22] YNR_Chewmiester: I haven't touched Retail since Classic dropped few years ago so not sure how I feel about new expansion. I started playing Feb 2008. Wrath & MoP were last expansions I really played a lot of.
[14:35:31] Darthyrevan: More cookie cutter stuff :/
[14:35:33] cranjismcbasketball069: he's asking about hybrid specs
[14:35:33] MrTerkyMan: I think the base class trees will give you that
[14:35:40] s4boi: yes. you get to choose your spec. Left side is Class wide tree, right side is spec specific
[14:35:43] chubahi: only bad thing is that u cant tank whit the new class :(
[14:35:45] garkhyt: Ion said it the interview you can have hybrid
[14:35:46] Ortinoth: left is class points and right is spec tree
[14:35:51] Kooznik: Balance druids able to get solar beam and skull bash now is actually awesome! Love it
[14:35:57] garkhyt: retri holy, etc
[14:36:03] rjselzler: Left tree: class identity. Right tree: spec identity.
[14:36:06] Phantom_wulfstan: @Velashen  he makes valid complants better then pretending to be ok with everything so what is your point?
[14:36:06] Ortinoth: so it seems to `be 30 for class and 30 points for spec builds
[14:36:39] chubahi: wotlk pally was great !
[14:36:41] Ortinoth: shockadins are back
[14:36:43] toyturtlesruwu: maybe you missed my question. I need to get a new gaming computer any suggested brand to get? I keep coming across a brand OMEN but have no idea if they are good maker? any input suggestion for getting a new gamer computer?
[14:36:46] Wrath_Twitch: so points are shared between left and right trees? if someone doesnt hybrid, left side may be unused (or dump leftover points)? maybe too early to tell
[14:36:46] chubahi: cant wait to play it again SOON
[14:36:46] kurlook: oh man
[14:36:49] Velashen: @Phantom_wulfstan Some valid complaints. Most are just for attention/clicks.
[14:36:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: I really have to spend some time messing with them before I can say I love it or hate the skill trees
[14:36:56] xEredohx: xEredohx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! <3
[14:36:57] Ispintowin: kinda want to level a charcter and try otu wrathh classic
[14:37:06] usse00: "WoW Lead Game Designer Jeremy Feasel revealed that Renown is coming back for WoW: Dragonflight"
[14:37:06] Phantom_wulfstan: lolsure
[14:37:07] Rulem: and tier
[14:37:19] s4boi: I mean, it looks like we will have more room to build our hybrids, yes. The question is what existing stuff will be moved to "hybrid" part, and what will be goone completely.
[14:37:28] sulfater: will you still need your role to match your spec in LFG/LFR?
[14:37:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: The beta is very important to get it balanced and working right
[14:37:32] lithium364: frostfire mage Pog
[14:37:37] Kooznik: @Towelliee any guess when Alpha starts?
[14:37:41] NorthernWildlight: towHesaidit_TK
[14:37:43] YNR_Chewmiester: Currently leveling a Pally in TBC Classic. Might entertain WotLK tanking. Played just about every class a little bit in ICC back in the day
[14:37:45] garkhyt: That will be the main reason why there will be no system on top of the talent change :D
[14:38:04] rjselzler: It looks more interesting than what we have now but less convoluted that PoE, where you need a guide to even have a viable build IMO
[14:38:13] Rulem: they managed it in the first 8 years of WoW just fine
[14:38:13] s4boi: @YNR_Chewmiester DW unholy or Blood DPS poggers :D
[14:38:13] RagingPunk: wotlk alpha?
[14:38:27] duhegan: I get the vibe that throughput talents are spec specific, while class trees will support offspeccing, QoL, defensive, etc
[14:38:29] lithium364: if we get blood dps back im gonna freak out
[14:38:31] abruptdecayO_O: yeah whats the speculation for wrath beta/release times?
[14:38:31] mAiKa_______: I am just sad the new race is class locked but it makes sense in the story side but why :(
[14:38:42] cranjismcbasketball069: renown is back per a new interview
[14:38:46] Ispintowin: i opted-in for 10.0 earlier LUL
[14:38:52] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: one thing i would like to change for the new race is they can change to dragon form to  fly not flap the wings
[14:38:52] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee I wonder if they'll nerf the Necrolord Hearth Kidneystone soulbind trait to only work in Shadowlands. Otherwise it'd be natural to stick to Necrolord for the extra HS in Dragonflight...
[14:38:54] volkreig: @Towelliee renown is back for Dragonflight check wowhead
[14:38:55] Igen375: Do you think it will come out next year maybe Q1?  Sorry just got here im sure its been asked since the cinematic
[14:38:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah and people would take unkillable builds into PvP and really fuck shit up lol
[14:39:08] raldrik: I dont think you can do prot + holy. It showed class & spec as the 2 trees you can go into
[14:39:10] TheRavenGrave: Could the Xpac Be Getting Players Ready For The Rise Of The Undead???
[14:39:13] s4boi: @cranjismcbasketball069 and its character wide for all dragon aspects, ye
[14:39:14] chubahi: thats what i was thinknig also while was watching the video :D
[14:39:15] Voramir: that's fun though
[14:39:17] YNR_Chewmiester: @s4boi Blood DKs were insane at wrath launch! Literally all we used were 5 man dungeons with all blood DKs. #AllTheSelfHeals!
[14:39:30] MeisterPetze: dragnown
[14:40:00] s4boi: @YNR_Chewmiester it was solid ST DPS in 3.3.5 too, while unholy was AoE go to
[14:40:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: "activity centric"
[14:40:09] FilozofWoW: Alexensual says hi! :D lolz

[14:40:42] LeBigNose: sounds good
[14:40:49] raldrik: isnt that just rep
[14:40:51] Ortinoth: they just need to stop beating the bush and just give the community account wide progress for reps and other things
[14:40:57] MILESkg21: Tomato Tomatoe KEKW
[14:41:04] MrTerkyMan: incoming doomsayers over content they haven't seen or played with yet
[14:41:12] cranjismcbasketball069: is there player power tied to the renown?
[14:41:16] MVRD: <3 󠀀

[14:41:36] Ortinoth: account level banks as well
[14:41:37] abruptdecayO_O: no more seven alt campaign grinds
[14:41:41] c0mmander_starscream: I think WOW spegetti code is preventing BLizz from doing account wide
[14:41:42] xequinox98: agreed
[14:41:42] MVRD: <3 <3
[14:41:49] jure__: it has to happen, but it wont, because it cuts playtime too much
[14:41:50] Merex760: Like this renown thing, it needs to be account-wide
[14:41:52] Merex760: yup
[14:42:04] Mockle: 100% agree
[14:42:05] YNR_Chewmiester: fuck azurite system type shit
[14:42:06] Rudric_Ice: pls tell ION
[14:42:14] TigasLIVE: Cant wait to be evoker main KEKW
[14:42:20] ilikeblonde5: people will play for longer on alts instead of just not grinding it on every char
[14:42:20] Majorblindside: lost ark has us spiled lol
[14:42:20] Dark_lite7: no timegating, straight away
[14:42:23] TheCliffyShow: I'd be happy with just an account-wide bank and giving alts soulbound gear.
[14:42:24] Majorblindside: spoiled
[14:42:24] wowplaya4ever: !addons

[14:42:30] Krait06: hopefully you get to do more dev interviews like last time
[14:42:34] bangorangg: I have never been this excited for a wow xpac….. wow. I absolutely love the theme and idea of exploring a more grounded fantasy world.. and those talent trees!!!
[14:42:47] goofshot: did they mention something about other flying mount?
[14:42:49] RageQTT: and you can progress it regardless which character you're playing on
[14:42:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: MoP had those big boosts for alts, yeah
[14:42:52] c0mmander_starscream: Yea i hate azerite, it needs to die in a fire of napalm with Draenor
[14:43:01] Jamertamer: YEP
[14:43:03] kurlook: If they want peopel to explore alts then they need to explore more account wide avenues
[14:43:05] Snabido: Like MoP had LUL
[14:43:08] bangorangg: Never been so hyped. Such a breather have no big baddie in the cinematic, and more of a grounded xpac
[14:43:11] danskenntv: still waiting for them to remove all kinds of AP and stygia...then I might even come back to wow...but this 1-3 hours farm each day, no thanks
[14:43:11] junkrat_sky: new expansion means better stock up on GFUEL....lol
[14:43:11] Rexialiton: yeah true
[14:43:17] bangorangg: And dragonssssss
[14:43:18] Darthyrevan: i miss mists
[14:43:19] MrTerkyMan: Since its not related to player power you could argue it already is account wide since toys, mogs, mounts that youll get will be unlocked. But the gameplay aspect of it would still be there
[14:43:19] chubahi: that would be good !
[14:43:20] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee I think you have too much hope and optimism :D
[14:43:24] garkhyt: Agree account wide should be part of the next expansion

[14:43:40] Rudric_Ice: what is the system with dragon flying ? i didn't really get it are those just mounts
[14:43:40] Ortinoth: push to remove character cap per account too
[14:43:42] wowplaya4ever: but blizzard does not always listen
[14:43:42] bob2305: Its the grind that just drains and makes you take a month break from wow
[14:43:44] garkhyt: You can see the quality of life even from what they introduce in Mortis
[14:43:48] Ortinoth: 50 is out dated
[14:43:55] MrPantySniffer: whats nemn of namnplats?
[14:44:14] bangorangg: Im getting HEAVY similar vibes to MoP direction / design direction. More grounded, exploring, no immediate big baddie
[14:44:22] bangorangg: Could not be more excited
[14:44:30] Ortinoth: @Towelliee  currencies should be shared on account as well
[14:44:31] bangorangg: Get us to the dragon isles!!
[14:44:40] gfvaris: rep only on main, cyphers share
[14:44:43] bangorangg: Who is ready to make their own dragon
[14:44:45] balancedlight: what mount are you riding?
[14:44:52] Rulem: its GW2 mounts!
[14:44:55] Theduskflyer: And for fucks sake, make the reputation gear, mean something. This, here’s a mid ilvl belt at exhalted that lower inlvl than a heroic dungeon. What’s the point
[14:45:01] fred_birkhoff: they're mounts with skills and you can reach different places depending on skills
[14:45:02] SirSquaggles: GW2 Mounts :D 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[14:45:07] MrFEGISEN: The Dragon Riding works like Griffon in Guild Wars 2
[14:45:12] Ortinoth: its from deathwing
[14:45:14] cruzeal: ah like cloud serpents
[14:45:20] garkhyt: its another content

[14:45:23] darkrowse21: where is chest drops extra motes
[14:45:25] EmpathyLiveChat: Do we know if we'll be able to travel between zones on ground mounts?
[14:45:34] bangorangg: Theyre gonna be cosmetic and mount type shit. Can make them look how you want
[14:45:36] Honeycrispie: renown coming back monkaS  󠀀
[14:45:36] fred_birkhoff: they're like your pal, exactly like how to train your dragon
[14:45:37] just_laxus: i love that they include some sort of flying from the beginning
[14:45:38] AtsiGames: @balancedlight it's one of the mounts from hc Madness of Deathwing in Dragon Soul
[14:45:43] enux337: bear bombing
[14:45:43] Theduskflyer: No shit @mileskg21
[14:45:44] Rexialiton: thats gotta be awesome
[14:45:50] bangorangg: Ohh shit
[14:45:52] Mockle: I hope the gear for your dragons has meaning to it, for example more bag space
[14:45:53] MVRD: @Towelliee Renown Returning for WoW: Dragonflight - Advance All Reputations Simultaneously 󠀀
[14:45:54] bangorangg: Thats sick idea
[14:45:58] wowplaya4ever: what var?
[14:46:04] Ortinoth: wowhead says you work on all reps at once
[14:46:14] Ortinoth: it seems but this still should be account wide progress
[14:46:17] TigasLIVE: When pre order? They said something?
[14:46:21] gooni_coyg: Alot of cosmetic.. I like it
[14:46:25] SilkeySmooth: will normal flying mounts be unable to be used?
[14:46:34] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Maybe we are starting with just an egg and then when it hatches then we get flying and teaching our dragon that random stuff\
[14:46:37] y0rtek: for sure. they said flying with the dragon shit at the start.
[14:46:38] c0mmander_starscream: So no pathfinder bullshit?
[14:46:38] Kneckt: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1516514498311385088 the cinematic narrarated
[14:46:42] s4boi: @TigasLIVE nothing about preorders
[14:46:42] bangorangg: I just cant wait to explore the more grounded theme of dragon isles. Zones look beautiful. Fuckkk i feel like a little kid. Most excited ive been for an xpac in so many years
[14:47:03] Eonait: i know right!
[14:47:09] AtsiGames: @SilkeySmooth they'll prolly clear this up later, but I doubt this is an issue that should worry you
[14:47:14] Meliea_EU: hate aggro mechanics in wow, other mmo done better
[14:47:20] SilkeySmooth: @bangorangg same here i love the land before time look and how massive the zones look
[14:47:27] s4boi: @bangorangg yea, one of them has that Grizzly hills vibe <3
[14:47:29] bangorangg: Yesss
[14:47:30] TheCliffyShow: The birds in ZM are homoicidal.
[14:47:30] wowplaya4ever: what do you think about Elon Musk taking over Twitter?

[14:47:41] N3llee: thank you modz. appreicate the extra effort.
[14:47:43] Ortinoth: most likely the 'train your dragon will be time gated'
[14:47:49] AtsiGames: @wowplaya4ever or trying LMAO

[14:48:07] danskenntv: @Towelliee The new class, did I get it right, they cant be tanks? =/
[14:48:08] SilkeySmooth: @AtsiGames with their investment in to the dragon flying tree they mote not let you use normal mounts.
[14:48:24] Thoreya: im gonna be the best envoker out there :)
[14:48:25] bangorangg: Cannot wait for launch. Sooooo excited hahah. Lil kid all over again. Wasnt wxcited for Sl/ bfa after announcements but this looks incredible. More like og wow vibes
[14:48:33] 91Niki: @N3llee No problem! Apologize for the collaterally damage there <3 Chat was a bit out of control, and we tried fix it

[14:49:02] Pink_Cassie: Man i got so tired of doing the maw at the beginning lol
[14:49:03] Xsilentghost: renown being added back idk how I feel about that
[14:49:04] Mockle: @Towelliee I really like they stepped away from that space robot theme with the new expansion and went back to warcraft fantasy
[14:49:06] Taco117: people going crazy saying they are going hard on the new expansion but didnt touch shadowlands
[14:49:18] Ortinoth: yeah alt skip as long as you finished it on one character on your account  - this should be for both factions on your account
[14:49:21] dracullus: maybe there is no intro, just hop on the ship/zeppelin and you're on isles
[14:49:28] cinamonjackz: Im curious to what their plan is with legendaries!
[14:49:32] 91Niki: @Merex760 Long time no see POGGERS
[14:49:38] YeahImJordan: didnt seem like that at all
[14:49:38] Krait06: only time will tell
[14:49:50] daegoh: who is the different leadership? It looked like the same people sitting there.
[14:49:51] c0mmander_starscream: So pretty much stuff we asked Blizz for 10 yrs ago

[14:50:13] TheCliffyShow: Alex Douchbagrabi
[14:50:14] Orion280: this expac looks really promising i want to know more

[14:50:28] c0mmander_starscream: Has Ion gotten shitcanned yet
[14:50:29] Theduskflyer: Towelliee, would you rather RNG legendaries, or the crafted kind? Also how about raid leggos like daggers, staff  etc
[14:50:29] rjselzler: Holly's from EQ back in the day
[14:50:34] s4boi: @Zorebots Not even close, but good to see that more people lay on it :D
[14:50:34] just_laxus: i feel like blizzard is trying very hard to show us that they do care about wow and that the bad people are all gone and things will be different
[14:50:42] darkrowse21: one guy was ripped 💪
[14:50:43] Thoreya: @daegoh did u watch more than 5 minutes?"
[14:50:47] rjselzler: She was Holly Windstalker in game
[14:50:48] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee why no pre order there is usually a pre order after the announcement?
[14:50:52] donkunn: it feels like it is very far away from release
[14:50:59] AtsiGames: @cinamonjackz I'd love a super long questline for each class to get their own leggos, kinda like how they last did it with the cloak in MoP or the ring in WoD
[14:51:00] Snabido: WoD ring
[14:51:01] Pink_Cassie: I am honestly excited. I am looking forward to something different than shadowlands. I have had my fill of it lol >_<
[14:51:05] Zorebots: TALENT TREE SYSTEM HAS ALOT OF PROMISE, ITS GETTING CLOSER TO WHAT PROJECT ASSECION IS
[14:51:13] Snabido: MoP was slightly different
[14:51:18] Icemanbaird: Getting rid of our legion weapons seemed so wrong imo lol
[14:51:20] Kujo_XX: @donkunn I think the leaker that's been mostly right predicted Nov.
[14:51:22] daegoh: I know there were others. I mean the leadership. @thoreya He said there were different leadership.

[14:52:09] captiv8: I loved the rng of legion legendaries. I’m the minority though I know.
[14:52:13] akaari5486: I like everthing about Dragonflight so far,but im afraid of having lack of content.In Legion we had artifact weapons,In SL cloaks,what we gonna do in dragonflight
[14:52:13] jure__: @SpidercowSD bro you got like a year before the exp pack is out
[14:52:19] arrk___: i was expecting disapointment but was actually very happy with the xpack

[14:52:41] just_laxus: maybe legendarys will be their borrowed power like system
[14:52:43] XugieXugo: The wow team seems to be listening more to the community then they used too. I am seeing changes as small as they are they still are changes, and they seem to be going in a good direction.
[14:52:48] spyderman62: But don't forget the bow wasn't legendary at first

[14:53:05] Snabido: Needed rep with Wrathion 😏
[14:53:17] AtsiGames: I barely missed the cloak, but I did get the ring day 1 of the patch the ring came out as a reward
[14:53:21] Mockle: so is there a new big bad guy in the new expansion?
[14:53:21] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee i made 7 cloaks in pandaria. And loved them. Such a massive upgrade.
[14:53:29] TigasLIVE: @Towelliee Pre-patch prediction?

[14:56:34] Darkgx5: @towelliee I noticed the drakthyr were the female models do you think those models are for both or will there be different male models?
[14:56:36] pereadin: Tier is about as bae as Sylvanas
[14:56:39] FranciscoTheMage: BACK.. why on earth was the reason they decided NO tier sets
[14:56:44] genesis063: So think there is still some stuff to come out about wrath?  Seeing some of that experiment gameplay in wrath later down the line?
[14:56:45] FranciscoTheMage: what was that? why?
[14:56:55] AtsiGames: @Emirbt these could as well be placeholder dates, but early 2023 is a safe bet for a launch date
[14:57:01] Theduskflyer: Think we do something in the caverns of time? Dungeon or raid
[14:57:02] Ortinoth: everyone loves tier always have i was one of them
[14:57:07] Ortinoth: hated to see them removed
[14:57:07] bigpppower527: i think there will be new galakrond dragoon as a 10.x boss

[14:57:51] garkhyt: Scam LOL
[14:57:52] Orcan3: @Towelliee What are you thinking about renown returning? Theres a thing on wowhead about it now.
[14:57:54] itsTwigs_: will you post a youtube video on your expac thoughs? Pretty sure I missed it at work
[14:57:56] xiistormy: Yeah i bought one earlier it gave me 18 motes -.-
[14:58:01] cinamonjackz: Did they even say anything about Nozdormu @Towelliee? I only remember them saying something about Alex, Wration, Kalec, and Ysera's daughter
[14:58:10] XugieXugo: Blizz should just have art contest every season on class sets and weapon concept art
[14:58:14] dracullus: @Towelliee this isn't legit way of farming them, just cypher dump
[14:58:20] Rustofer: what add-ons you using @towelliee ??
[14:58:31] Orcan3: Yeah and all are progressing at the same time apparently
[14:58:41] AtsiGames: @cinamonjackz they intentionally didn't. he's prolly gonna be plenty important to the story
[14:58:44] s4boi: @cinamonjackz No mention of Nozdormu, tho they did just mention Infinite dragons.
[14:58:50] HaloS23: @Towelliee have to figure out new channel points now bud!
[14:58:50] Snabido: @cinamonjackz They mentioned bronze and infinite flights, bet your ass Nozzy is included
[14:58:55] XugieXugo: its not a pet you can lvl
[14:58:57] FranciscoTheMage: another Quote to die by... "Unlocked Unleashed"

[14:59:26] s4boi: @TMMOOF Yes please! :D
[14:59:33] AtsiGames: @cinamonjackz we could experience in real time Nozdormu's descent to madness, which we technically prevented, but didn't rly
[14:59:41] Theduskflyer: They need to buff all the drops in ZM
[15:00:10] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what was that quote that ion wll never live down.. bring the player not he class or something?
[15:00:10] pereadin: And the Lattice drop rate
[15:00:16] Snabido: Trade relics for motes, lets gooo

[15:00:34] AtsiGames: @bagrain nope, not a word
[15:00:37] mavericks312: my lock would be 246 if they were accountwide
[15:00:37] MetalManGG: this guy KEKW
[15:00:42] DrkPhoenix6913: at the VERY least they should make those sand relics stack to 2k not 250
[15:00:53] TacDuc: @ArmanBomaye Paladin hammer

[15:01:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those DK's love slappy hands
[15:01:19] abracka_: it looked like the convoke icon was in that talent tree for druids
[15:01:21] Ortinoth: we just have to see what stays what goes
[15:01:25] pereadin: Ashen wouldn’t make it lore wise for any spec
[15:01:29] Splashdownn: @Towelliee you think they'd pick one and not give you all of the options?
[15:01:31] garkhyt: Same as they did when the artifact weapon right, some of those power from the weapon was incorporated in the talent
[15:01:56] Hypn0tical: @Towelliee the slot with convoke is a choose, you select which cov ability to take
[15:01:58] Rabbi19: As a boomy I hate convoke.
[15:02:00] pereadin: It’s gonna be the tolls, convoke, finality (rogue), brand (DH), deaths due even.

[15:04:34] AtsiGames: @ttvimwindow Life-Binder's Handmaiden from HC Dragon Soul
[15:04:35] nightmayor12: papa johns is the best of the fast food pizza chains for sure
[15:04:42] Dark_lite7: @Dark_lite7 Wild Spirits just doesn't fit with the hunter theme imo
[15:04:45] Armdel: Is this a preorder mount? Kappa

[15:06:59] garkhyt: You think talent revamp would come early?
[15:07:01] swordart2022: Do you think they will announce soemthing /pre orders on Summer game fest ??? @Towelliee
[15:07:01] TigasLIVE: @Towelliee https://imgur.com/a/en1ZdXx did you saw this?
[15:07:04] Ortinoth: August -october for closed beta
[15:07:10] boopbopbamski: Q1 would be really good
[15:07:10] s4boi: @blackandgoldsteelers it does, i play and raid on controller
[15:07:19] RealInsanoid: will the new race ride a mount for the dragon riding system or they will just fly in their normal form, i wonder!
[15:07:21] MVRD: thats by far too early 󠀀 󠀀
[15:07:49] blackandgoldsteelers: @blackandgoldsteelers Oh nice. Is it worth getting Shadowlands? im thinking of getting it

[15:15:02] Drizz_36: nah, we won't have a release date for a while
[15:15:04] howlingstorms: did i miss anything in the last hour was awawy
[15:15:21] Drizz_36: blizzard probably don't even know yet
[15:15:21] TwitchGurls: wrath will be this year
[15:15:42] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[15:15:45] zgag: @Towelliee When do you expect beta
[15:15:48] grisvalds: im guessing november
[15:15:54] grisvalds: for wotlk realse
[15:16:14] MysticalOS: people getting mad before reading it
[15:16:18] blood_blayde: pernicus1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[15:16:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: salty comments LUL
[15:16:23] Drizz_36: renown wasn't even close to the worst thing, wtf
[15:16:27] s4boi: @RealInsanoid imagine new dragon race in dragon form mounting a dragon. Could that be considered as... p0rn? xD
[15:16:29] enux337: it was locking covenants
[15:16:31] irlock143: @Towelliee  sorry for this dumb question but just getting back to the game from a 7 month break why did they drop us back to green gear just to farm more purples ?
[15:16:31] YNR_Chewmiester: Is Factor worth the cost? I'm too lazy to cook after work & gym. I used to do HomeChef, but cooking takes a bit.
[15:16:38] MyNameIsVortex: I personally thought the entire reveal was a bit underwhelming
[15:16:43] Wavekingg: I am interested to see the DH talent trees, since the new talent tree is pretty much insipred by classic, which DH was not apart of, Thoughts?   @Towelliee
[15:16:51] aribellae: I missed it, why are we talking about renown?
[15:17:01] Rexialiton: players are just commenting on what they hear and not what they understand imo
[15:17:15] Snabido: Good ol' headline reading 😏
[15:17:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm fine with changes
[15:17:42] chickdrummer88: towKawaii Sup guys
[15:17:43] zgag: Going to be vital for Bliizzard to make sure that beta isn't purely about marketing, but more about testing/feed-back
[15:17:43] TwitchGurls: iam watching the deep dive into the expasion now
[15:17:50] abracka_: one of the reasons i quit TBC was because my guild expected raids every single night besides thursdays
[15:17:52] Chuckforfun: We need more GDKP runs Kappa
[15:17:56] enux337: LUL if they do flex
[15:18:01] Remiix_o: you could only do that in one tier in wrath anyways I'm fairly certain and that was TotC
[15:18:05] jkitchin75: why are thay taking dung finnder out?
[15:18:13] Klipan89: So this x-pac looks like it wont have tons of shit to farm if u want to raid or do M+
[15:18:24] mugwurt: EXACTLY
[15:18:32] bubonicblade: THE RETURN OF TALENT TREEEEEES WOOOOO!!
[15:18:34] mugwurt: they just want that server xfer money
[15:18:43] grisvalds: indeed.. runing 4 raids in one week, + all the daileys and what not to follow. Gone take alot of time. But hyped for wotlk no mater what!
[15:18:45] itsapaul: Dungeon finder wasnt in for most of it anyway
[15:18:46] Yosbo: there were threats to azaroth for 10k years and we saved it multiple times from dying but now all of a sudden the dragons are gonna protect it? what are they the eternals? xD also who is the villian?
[15:18:49] MysticalOS: Dungeon finder should be out, at start. add it later when it came
[15:18:54] Spanksalot_4DWIN: dunno if i can be bothered without LFD
[15:18:55] chickdrummer88: I'm loving the little things making their way over from FF14 to WoW
[15:18:57] MysticalOS: not out forever but def at start
[15:19:15] YungDizzY: I want to play wrath but that damn shadowmore grind...sheeeee
[15:19:17] Grunton: the no changes people are bad for the game
[15:19:21] enux337: people still flew to icc dungeons
[15:19:21] mavericks312: should be in at launch
[15:19:24] TwitchGurls: cross faction
[15:19:40] enux337: id start with the dungeon finder
[15:19:44] MysticalOS: wrath is doomed without changes. they are gonna have to buff the raids, even in pre nerf
[15:19:44] Jokervenom1978: I'll admit im dissapointed. Im casual and i was looking forward to the group finder in wroth.
[15:19:51] mavericks312: classic andies crying there hearts out
[15:19:52] onous_: Only Alliance players want cross faction..
[15:19:53] Two_Headed_Raven: i dont get why ppl are against dung finder. for what reason do you not want it?
[15:19:53] MysticalOS: especially naxx, people JUST DID naxx in classic
[15:19:55] jaina8675309: just have servers with it and not
[15:19:56] Its_big_t: Hi towelie - any thoughts on the UI changes I might have missed?
[15:19:57] mugwurt: BUT MUH SOCIAL FABRIC
[15:20:00] abracka_: @chickdrummer88 those crafting/profession update nods to XIV got me giddy
[15:20:03] flo_406: yall getting bent over a version of the game you wont even play
[15:20:04] YungDizzY: I still have my laptop i played wrath on
[15:20:06] Fujin321: The irony is that Dungeon Finder fits better in these classic era releases than it did when it originally released. Population sky rockets at the start of these classic releases and nose dive on servers.
[15:20:07] denflup: man i love wow
[15:20:17] chickdrummer88: @chickdrummer88 Yeah, I'm so excited.
[15:20:22] Dirtnose: @Biby07 wouldnt no changes include the finder though? it was in wotlk
[15:20:24] N3llee: i thought the UI was a rip from old xperl from back in the day
[15:20:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are not breaking the add-ons, so I think it's win-win with the UI
[15:20:32] itsapaul: @Jinxterz Cuts down on assholes. People are toxic with randoms with no consequences, not so much when you have to be nice to get into groups
[15:20:52] timmythegamertv: IMO they should hide the group finder option behind a setting that you have to enable, so people don't have immediate access to it
[15:20:53] MysticalOS: the UI overhall on retail is more likley to hurt classic than anything. the more classic and retail diverge from one another, the more annoyed addon authors will be on bothering to maintain compat with both
[15:20:58] thugenz: does this patch look like it will be better than SL was? SL made me quit
[15:21:00] MysticalOS: some authros are gonna diverge and be classic only or retail only
[15:21:07] chickdrummer88: I mean, they could bring some of those add on devs into Blizzard and pay them to make add-ons for default UI
[15:21:07] Two_Headed_Raven: fair enough
[15:21:10] Grunton: more streamlined fetures would be good
[15:21:29] Kneckt: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1516524054764834823
[15:21:34] cazhually: whens alpha?
[15:21:42] TwitchGurls: will there be a B slider
[15:21:43] enux337: what?
[15:21:45] Unstoppable1222: Who is against addons like that lmao
[15:21:46] enux337: LUL
[15:21:51] Skylin3r: @chickdrummer88 why would they pay for something they get for free
[15:21:52] Nimz83: FF14 players? lol
[15:21:54] mavericks312: asmons cult lol
[15:22:05] Skylin3r: addons been here since vanilla beta
[15:22:06] Vadoloco: When is the official announcement?? do we learn more today, or is all info out?
[15:22:17] chickdrummer88: @chickdrummer88 Yeah...
[15:22:27] Unstoppable1222: Only place addons SHOULDNT be a part of is Arena tournaments
[15:22:33] Rexialiton: what does that mean?
[15:22:43] Todmeister9000: DansGame
[15:22:47] chickdrummer88: Addons should not be allowed in any tournament play.
[15:22:54] MysticalOS: there has been a strong movement to have addons removed surprisingly. they think addons are reason for game being easier and completely ignore youtube, twitch, wowhead guides, and just general player knowledge being the reasons...it's all the addons fault
[15:22:55] Feeos: I'm excited we have a new ranged dps
[15:23:01] Sadisticmedic: @Vadoloco The announce was 5 hours ago it all on Twitter
[15:23:04] Rexialiton: KEKW
[15:23:04] swordart2022: KEKW
[15:23:11] denflup: KEKW
[15:23:13] hellsinge: hey towelliee
[15:23:14] Sadisticmedic: KEKW
[15:23:14] Phantom_wulfstan: @Nimz83 lol you just wanted to blame us for something huh lol
[15:23:16] Aidler: it’s mainly the crazy ideas of asmon and his followers mirror them
[15:23:21] nightmayor12: Im not expecting this expac to ship till after august 2023 if im being completely realistic
[15:23:24] UltraKSlaya: demon hunters and dracthyr should have flight form like druids Kappa
[15:23:25] SeroVinoGG: That no LFG in wrath is a terrible idea
[15:23:33] Nimz83: @Biby07 As do I, but I can see someone who doesn't play WoW thinking that removing addons isn't such a bad idea.
[15:23:37] Kiddeath77: Hope they let us go wild on these talent trees
[15:23:45] Nimz83: @Phantom_wulfstan I play FF14 also, lol
[15:23:47] Yosbo: Im suprised Blizzard hasnt jumped on the whole addon system like bethesda did with mods for skyrim aka payed where creators get a cut
[15:23:53] Vadoloco: @Sadisticmedic Tyvm mate <3 im late to the party, ill go on twitter and see
[15:23:53] Daggerstry: Did Wrath have LFG on release?
[15:23:54] Shallo1988: i played wrath the most out of any expansion and i am not excited at all lol
[15:23:55] s4boi: @SeroVinoGG Its blizzard, they will probably revisit that one.
[15:23:56] MxViolet: @SeroVinoGG why, there's no LFG now
[15:24:01] RoubeyY: RoubeyY subscribed with Prime. 
[15:24:02] SeroVinoGG: those classic andys RUINED it lol
[15:24:02] uglla3np: Isnt holinka one of the last old school guys at blizzard? all others got fired for molesting? damn son
[15:24:02] Drizz_36: @Daggerstry, no it was added in 3.3 i believe
[15:24:05] chickdrummer88: @Nimz83 FF14 doesn't NEED addons because their boss mechanics are clearly visable
[15:24:13] derekrh: LFG is fine, LFR is not
[15:24:21] Austei: i liked lfg for wrath personlly
[15:24:25] mugwurt: it's like Blizz doesn't even play their own game, so out of touch
[15:24:26] TwitchGurls: Asmon is the Blizz silent partner..but not silent :P
[15:24:26] Ragevamp666: lfg in wotlk was shit
[15:24:26] Stealinheals: they should have lfg, will only make it better imo
[15:24:29] denflup: they listen to the esfand's and the staysafe's, thinking they represent the average classic player
[15:24:29] Eviltuna13: No LFG in Wrath. players but what about dead servers WoW devs well i guess it will be easier for you to find a group then huh
[15:24:31] Dravek63: Dravek63 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 125 months! 
[15:24:34] Lex_Payne: gold buying and inflation is my big pet peeve in classic
[15:24:36] Raxus: no pre orders,  thats suprising
[15:24:38] MysticalOS: almost all the changes they announced for classic, were ones brought up by esfand and others in the private classic discord channel to devs, but that discord is an echo chamber of private server/classic players
[15:24:39] Aidler: without LFG I at least have to do no dungeons naguuraSip
[15:24:44] Drizz_36: i quit WoW back in 3.2 so I never even played with the LFG tool back then
[15:24:53] MxViolet: I like that classic is not going to follow the modernization and stay old school. form groups yourself
[15:24:56] Alaquane: merge LFR/normal/Heroic into one difficulty
[15:24:58] Dirtnose: yeah dragon soul was lfr
[15:24:59] s4boi: @Daggerstry No, it came with ICC. Mains and main alts were already outgearing out of it. It was there for daily justice and gearing alts/catchup.
[15:25:02] Shallo1988: Cross faction in WOTLK confirmed!
[15:25:02] Feeos: what percent of players is gonna ne dracthyr. half or more of a raid being evoker
[15:25:04] Daggerstry: LFR is needed now a days for campaign quests and getting to see content
[15:25:05] Kinghorn: thought it was pandaland 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[15:25:08] Kinghorn: huh
[15:25:09] MysticalOS: i saw the raid lockout rquest, arena teams request, and LFG request all in that channel
[15:25:12] MxViolet: LFR wasnt until Dragon Soul
[15:25:16] swordart2022: People dont play Classic for QoL :P
[15:25:18] MxViolet: LFG was in Wrath
[15:25:18] SalinityErq: LFR was dragon soul
[15:25:22] s4boi: Yea, DS was first LFR
[15:25:22] Remiix_o: yes, Dragon Soul was the first
[15:25:36] Fujin321: Yeah the dungeon finder tool is a good fit for Classic Releases. The funny thing is it's actually a bigger improvement for Classic era servers than it was for it's original release.
[15:25:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[15:25:40] Syrreall_: there are players who would be interested in wotlk that are not interested in vanilla classic. but they are listening to vanilla classic players
[15:25:47] YNR_Chewmiester: yeah, it was Dragon Soul. I remember running the shit out of DS LFR as a Holy Priest
[15:25:53] Shallo1988: Kappa
[15:25:59] YNR_Chewmiester: #LFRHero
[15:26:08] MysticalOS: just let me know when we get to classic MoP
[15:26:08] Daggerstry: Wrath should definitely NOT have cross faction, it was all about faction wars
[15:26:09] kroode7: @Towelliee What happed to wotlk plus you were talking about?
[15:26:13] feherlofia123: talent trees look dope
[15:26:14] Aidler: I‘m a big fan of LFR but only because that’s the only way to raid for me.
[15:26:37] drunch85: crossfaction in ICC... shooting your own faction ship down
[15:26:43] daegoh: In FF14 you literally queue for everything. But for some reason in wow it ruins the game.
[15:26:53] Daggerstry: Now they should bring back Titanforging >:D
[15:26:54] Rudric_Ice: man all the new zones looked really good
[15:26:59] s4boi: Well i can get behind crossfraction in modern, with all tensions toning down a bit as we are focused on saving the world.  Crossfraction in LK - simply no. Thats when fraction was escalated due to ICC gates incident.
[15:27:00] Ragevamp666: lets just see if you get lfg in wotlk how happy you will be its gonna suck
[15:27:04] MxViolet: I like the Dragon Isles will have pvp on the ship to the Dragon Isles lmao
[15:27:09] Zaberoth: Zaberoth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 91 months, currently on a 91 month streak! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[15:27:16] abracka_: there's a reason why wrath was the most popular xpac
[15:27:25] Cilir: I'm so glad that my job has vacation time. I'll have enough to take a whole month off just to play dragonflight when it comes out.
[15:27:32] diivil92: i am a late wrath baby as so i was called if no LFG then fuck that
[15:27:34] TwitchGurls: vanilla players wont play wrath
[15:27:35] ManneehFresh: @Towelliee how many classics expansions do they have left?
[15:27:39] MxViolet: Wrath had a LOT of complaints at the time.. its only regarded with rose goggles now
[15:27:50] MxViolet: Wrath babies, welfare epics etc etc
[15:27:53] YNR_Chewmiester: @aidler same. The last time I had time to be on a dedicated Raid team was Wrath. Raided the entire expansion start to finish. As soon as Cata droppedmy real life got in the way. I don't have time to dedicate to raiding unfortunately
[15:27:59] Gealls: Where are all super hype changes to wrath you hinted?
[15:28:06] mugwurt: I mean, the Dungeon Finder decision was so obvious, how could they fuck that one up?
[15:28:20] Myndjestyr: im surprised the night elves are cool w that
[15:28:25] YungDizzY: fuck that we need WAR!!!!!
[15:28:45] xxsargexx: we got war in BFA and look how that turned out LUL
[15:28:47] Phantom_wulfstan: @daegoh people complain about it in 14 aswell its just the devs know to ignore 1.0 fanboys
[15:28:52] ManneehFresh: I feel likes its going to be a good thing. would bring the community closer together
[15:28:53] Skylin3r: world of peacecraft
[15:29:00] MysticalOS: guilds were migrated to communiiies backend in 7.3.5
[15:29:01] TwitchGurls: best if vanilla stick with their flavor...and leave the other alone
[15:29:07] Atokiri: @mugwurt i can think on many big stremers/tubers that think LFG killed wow so... yeah blizz its literally doing that to show people why LFG its good in retail
[15:29:09] chinfu303: WAR WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR
[15:29:13] MysticalOS: and communities are already cross faction in 9.2.5
[15:29:17] ManneehFresh: yea i never understood that part lol
[15:29:18] chilliooo: war of worldcraft
[15:29:18] Its_big_t: Can dracthyr go to the SL?
[15:29:22] Kindosar: with the way they're doing it, you can still play the way you want, go kill people lol
[15:29:25] MysticalOS: guild is just a few more steps but the technical work is there
[15:29:26] YungDizzY: i mean it called WARcraft
[15:29:28] arturiuss44: Be interesting what Ruin thinks of cross faction?
[15:29:30] Austei: now its hug time!
[15:29:30] T0MMYT: He knows Kappa
[15:29:31] blanchard62: @Towelliee what were you saying about wotlk the other day? That blizzard was working on something new for it??
[15:29:32] enux337: we want world pvp thats one sideed 24/7
[15:29:35] EmperorFredd: Lok'tar brothers SMOrc Clap
[15:29:44] Dravek63: @Towelliee car! Car!! War on pause
[15:29:51] michaelmm: I think we'll get cross faction guilds in 10.0 - they just won't want to promise/commit to it till they see how 9.2.5 plays out.
[15:29:52] jmalmin: Or a Panda monk kicking both the horde and the alliance rear end using a stick.
[15:29:54] daveyo889: sounds good to me
[15:29:54] crittinkitten: Horde and Alliance shouldn't war anymore, but there are cool stories to explore as exreme factions from each side create problems for players to solve
[15:29:59] Darkalex175: Personally interested in seeing where the "no changes" vocals are in this whole LFG mess. im sure it would boggle the mind
[15:30:00] TacDuc: I will kill gnomes whenever I see them
[15:30:02] MasterNeff: Just tuned in, How'd you feel about what they announced @Towelliee
[15:30:03] blanchard62: @Towelliee what were you saying about wotlk the other day? That blizzard was working on something new for it?
[15:30:10] Sadisticmedic: Alliance and Horde vs Old Gods
[15:30:11] Glowstik925: Would've been awesome if Brann Bronzebeard may a return for the Dragon Isles... hopefully he'll be on that expedition they said you embark on to arrive at the isles
[15:30:14] Rudric_Ice: night elves should divert from alliance tho like horde did Dem dirty
[15:30:16] Daggerstry: @arturiuss44 No one cares about Ruin. They are a bunch of no lifers who shittalk people who aren't grouped like they are, and they kill the BG if they don't have one group by leaving
[15:30:19] Remiix_o: so the only thing that I think there needs to be a discussion about with LFG is the leveling process. Because it did bring about bonus xp for completion then
[15:30:20] Skylin3r: what they really need is a 3rd faction, for 3 way wars
[15:30:21] Aidler: so the classic scene from the mop intro
[15:30:27] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @blanchard62 (warning)
[15:30:28] audrock7: truth
[15:30:33] MasterNeff: @Towelliee nah i get that, ill check out the vod thanks
[15:30:41] LeideGaming: hey so what about that reaction Kappa
[15:30:50] TwitchGurls: oh good i forgot about the vod...will check it out
[15:30:51] Durk101: last time i enjoyed horde v alliance  story was MoP when they invaded krasarang
[15:31:09] s4boi: @Aidler loved that one, that MoP trailer is as much funny as is epic
[15:31:09] LeideGaming: i look forward to these events
[15:31:30] Yosbo: just because there isnt a war doesnt mean they should like each other or work together.
[15:31:30] Sielu11628: https://twitter.com/keyboardturn/status/1516526100507111426?s=20&t=9jKXLVry-tjF8taXk3MBPg full 5 pages interview

[15:31:33] Drizz_36: bajheera 💪
[15:31:35] LeideGaming: alpha in 2 months probable?
[15:31:38] Dirtnose: @Durk101 The Horde Jade Forest levelling story is still one of my favourites.
[15:31:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: And there are quite a few PvP people, good to get their questions answered
[15:31:43] s4boi: Pilav ultimate warrior xD
[15:31:53] Austei: as Baj talks about lost ark pvp hehe
[15:32:04] TwitchGurls: Baj is a rock solid wow pvp guy ....never drops the ball
[15:32:41] Dongtanian: live from the gym
[15:32:49] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah Baj's interview is going to be live according to his twitter
[15:32:49] Eviltuna13: Wait so there is a Covent like system in DF?
[15:33:15] jason_tacey: Another Magniexpansion? LULW
[15:33:16] s4boi: @Eviltuna13 dragon aspect wide renoven, looks like it, ye.
[15:33:25] Trif0ld: has anyone gotten their hands on a talent calculator or DF?
[15:33:29] Mockle: @Eviltuna13 kinda but better and with less restrictions
[15:33:35] EllisTheMenace1: no way he out lifts baj though
[15:33:36] arturiuss44: @Daggerstry Tell me how you really feel lol Just asked cause Towell and Baj are friends with them and they are big on world PVP curious is all.  All opinions are interesting to me.
[15:34:26] Eviltuna13: thats good to know.

[15:34:37] Lemon_King: Blizzard's CDN is a little underload today.
[15:34:45] s4boi: Well, think of DF renown as old school reputation grind just incorporated into the story.
[15:34:46] Lemon_King: Not getting full dl rate.
[15:34:58] s4boi: @gedehams_goathams new race/class too
[15:35:02] Roaringkittylol: I seriously hope they make the renown system account wide... rather than locked to 1 character.
[15:35:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: The loadouts are great
[15:35:19] Jakesrevenge16: agreed
[15:35:20] Mattven: we need a grind
[15:35:21] swordart2022: Loadout is HUGE QOL
[15:35:28] Toon_irl: being able to import talents is pretty sweet
[15:35:29] Rudric_Ice: We COD now
[15:35:38] Austei: rift had loadout hehe
[15:35:40] Eviltuna13: Just give me LightWell and Light of the Naru and ill be happy
[15:35:42] daegoh: And the UI changing per spec
[15:35:42] s4boi: Yea, GW2 got loadouts like.. a year a go or so
[15:35:47] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Why no new tank spec for new class?
[15:35:56] Snabido: Why not?
[15:36:02] N3llee: @Milanesa_De_Pollo they answered that
[15:36:07] Rorill: What is Towellie nameplate addon ? looks dope
[15:36:20] Dongtanian: hoping you can import and export loadouts easy. so i can just rip some liquid or echo raiders build
[15:36:25] Emirbt: i think this expansion's main hero is gonna be Tyr
[15:36:26] blanchard62: and tier sets
[15:36:27] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @N3llee in an interview?
[15:36:30] Eraste: i really like the evoker but that race is ewww
[15:36:31] Drizz_36: i think that's great
[15:36:37] manthyx: i didnt liked the cinematic but i hope the espac in gonna b good
[15:36:42] Moh_Toh: MoeToee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[15:36:44] Mockle: @Milanesa_De_Pollo yeah kinda felt off because dh is similar and has a tank spec
[15:36:44] N3llee: @Milanesa_De_Pollo did you watch the announcement?
[15:36:46] Atokiri: Exorcism PepeHands
[15:36:47] swordart2022: GIGACHAD FULL DPS
[15:36:48] s4boi: @Milanesa_De_Pollo No Deathwind to learn them how to facetank xD
[15:36:51] gimmlay: i wonder how many dungeons/raids were getting at launch
[15:36:54] cinamonjackz: Tyr is dead @Emirbt
[15:36:59] Yosbo: 2 months in there will be cookie cutter builds for max dps etc
[15:37:00] raye_gaming22: incarn is a given unless they  change how convoke works
[15:37:07] NispyCriblet: also who cares
[15:37:08] yunitoYuniro: Have they said anything about the new wow mobile games?
[15:37:09] vadder_fister: they copied furries
[15:37:14] blanchard62: who cares if they copied it... thats a good thing
[15:37:15] OlStubbs: The main thing I could tell is the professions thing
[15:37:15] Celestia6: Do you think we will get animated shorts about each of the dragonflights? like the animated things they did for BFA and shadowlands?
[15:37:18] Dirtnose: Always good to take good things from other MMOs imo
[15:37:21] CritcobainTV: WoW to train your dragon FeelsGoodMan
[15:37:22] cdk058: custom ui maybe
[15:37:24] rblood80: Hi @towelliee
[15:37:24] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @N3llee yes, but they didn't explain why they didn't add a tank spec.
[15:37:25] Grunton: everythings from every game cant really say copied
[15:37:25] swordart2022: I am hyped for dragon control
[15:37:26] Atokiri: Blizzard copied SUper Mario
[15:37:28] Skylin3r: i don't see how the profs are like ffxiv
[15:37:33] Drizz_36: blizzard has always taken ideas from other MMOs, this is nothing new or bad
[15:37:33] Nebulizer87: I would say more inspiration from GW2 with mounts and loadouts
[15:37:35] Mockle: so what....take whats good and make it better
[15:37:38] s4boi: Loadouts are also GW2 stuff, but not specific to GW2
[15:37:40] Ghostzapp3r: Any idea what the filler content will be? Such as the AP grind in the past etc
[15:37:43] wpee86: It looks more like Rift talentsystem inspired.. Which is great.. That system is really amazing for diversity and class uniqueness
[15:37:43] Murrd0c: true
[15:37:45] N3llee: @Milanesa_De_Pollo they literally said why the chose the route they did
[15:37:45] Crypticedge: they havent revamped professions in years
[15:37:49] Shallo1988: lol facts
[15:37:57] dexfm: lol
[15:37:58] swordart2022: @wpee86 same as now do you play game right now ?
[15:37:59] Xsilentghost: where's the big expansion systems
[15:38:02] lithium364: professions could be huge for casual progression
[15:38:10] BfAleTitan: loadouts are just a game thing in general lol
[15:38:13] Crypticedge: cod has loadouts lol
[15:38:15] rblood80: What do you think about the new World of Warcraft Dragon Flight @towelliee
[15:38:16] uglla3np: we already have gear loadouts
[15:38:22] wpee86: @fairplay2021 Havent played for some months, played in the fall
[15:38:26] swordart2022: TSM should be banned
[15:38:30] Zephriel57: its not new for wow, we had loadout addons years ago.
[15:38:32] dreadvaine: Dragon flying looks fun tbh
[15:38:35] nhuh: taking something good from another MMO is a good thing imo
[15:38:36] Merex760: Ugh I hope now
[15:38:38] Merex760: not*
[15:38:46] daegoh: Oh for sure the work order system will be a dumpster fire
[15:38:47] Syrreall_: @Milanesa_De_Pollo the last 3 new classes all had tank specs. not every new class needs a tank spec
[15:38:48] Trif0ld: agreed
[15:38:49] Mastinoo: Man we really should get 10 man mythic raids. As many guilds just can’t keep up with a 20 man roster.
[15:38:50] Buckwink: just ban them
[15:38:52] s4boi: totally agree
[15:38:53] Eraste: wow tokens gonna dominate professions
[15:38:54] blanchard62: @Towelliee they can just not open the
[15:38:54] CritcobainTV: They just need to limit the amount of work orders you can have at a time @Towelliee
[15:38:55] Drizz_36: that's something blizzard will hopefully address in beta
[15:38:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: For profession orders, they will just have to make it where people are required to click something every time
[15:38:58] Aegrial: @Towelliee they are gonna need to break/disable AH API's so they cant be automated
[15:39:01] Sollice: @Towelliee I would think if you thought of it already they have hopefully already thought about it
[15:39:03] TwitchGurls: account sharing should be allowed
[15:39:03] XshadowturkeyX: wow had loadouts b4 allready, dual talent specs  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[15:39:04] rbolude: i hope if it happens they break it
[15:39:05] raye_gaming22: it will for sure have a CD no way you can spam orders
[15:39:06] blanchard62: @Towelliee teh can just not open the API to addons
[15:39:07] Skylin3r: i wonder how would work orders work with the quality system
[15:39:08] Grunton: they will have to remove ah api or it will be
[15:39:10] ezprit07: When new Xpac will be released?
[15:39:11] Kindosar: the "profession economy based people" use addons lol
[15:39:28] s4boi: one of solutions would be to limit WO per hour or add CD between them.
[15:39:30] Kneckt: yeah
[15:39:33] swordart2022: yes he said taht
[15:39:33] Sollice: You can specalize
[15:39:35] swordart2022: you can specialize
[15:39:39] N3llee: Given the TSm teams history and rep. They will take whatever blizz comes up with and make it 10 time sbetter
[15:39:42] Clicklesly: I don't think you can even take work orders, you just click to complete it?
[15:39:44] Trif0ld: thatll be so sick
[15:39:46] Buckwink: badass
[15:39:47] Darthyrevan: like new world
[15:39:52] EllisTheMenace1: so like new world
[15:39:52] yunitoYuniro: I wonder if archaeologist coming back to wow @towelliee
[15:40:02] Scoodles91: they'll have something like new world profession armor
[15:40:02] Shallo1988: i miss good crafting
[15:40:04] tragx: They're going with full profession gear, right? Like FFXIV
[15:40:06] LeGoogs: @Towelliee How much of what came out today did you already know?
[15:40:06] gimmlay: i wonder if the orders will take time to craft
[15:40:13] bagrain: seems similar to gw2 crafting
[15:40:16] gimmlay: kind of like lost ark crafting
[15:40:17] Calcium2662: the new dragon race is very ugly tho
[15:40:18] Drizz_36: i'd like to see them do more with archaeology for sure, this new system seems primed for that
[15:40:22] abracka_: seems like a good xpac to reintroduce it tbh
[15:40:24] XshadowturkeyX: so they are reverting stuff to the classic versions
[15:40:30] Atokiri: well it will make sense, since the 2 archaelogy factions are on the islands in the expedition
[15:40:34] CritcobainTV: you excited for wotlk? I'm just stoked to get another boost finally LUL
[15:40:34] Merex760: It should, and it's a good fit for Dragon Isles
[15:40:36] YNR_Chewmiester: people enjoyed archeology? LUL
[15:40:39] Croxssis: I hope that professions get a call back to classic professions where you can fill in gaps for your gear with crafting and they be competitive. Crafted gear doesn't seem as epic as it used to
[15:40:39] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[15:40:45] s4boi: @N3llee It wont be "better" if its automating new and interesting mechanic. Then it will force Blizzard to find solution to the problem and we all know how Blizzards "fixes" problems.
[15:40:45] N3llee: @Biby07 no
[15:40:54] Drizz_36: @YNR_Chewmiester, it wasn't perfect but now is the time to make improvements
[15:40:58] Kindosar: @yunitoYuniro funny meme on twitter showing crying meme "when archaeologist find out they can't dig up 10,000 year old relics in Dragonflight"
[15:41:11] Toon_irl: idk how I feel about renown returning, always felt very artificial in SL. But I'm also addicted to grinding shit lol
[15:41:11] enux337: its like a NEW MOP
[15:41:11] N3llee: @N3llee sounds like thats your opinion and not a fact
[15:41:18] ManneehFresh: they are trying to bring wow up to date with other games @Towelliee
[15:41:19] Austei: seems good to chnage things up
[15:41:27] Trif0ld: i'm shocked there wasnt some sort of time skip with the theme
[15:41:30] AstridLory: @towellie I love playing some music and clicking dirt around
[15:41:30] Eraste: stone bro from the trailer already is more interesting than any character in shadowlands
[15:41:31] XshadowturkeyX: wow 2.0 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[15:41:39] Buckwink: the future looks flight Smile
[15:41:44] malthus1: do you think they will add more faces/hairstyles/appearance options? seems like it was a huge win in shadowlands theb abandoned... id love achievement linked hairstyles!
[15:41:52] daegoh: Denathrius was cool
[15:42:03] tedol: is it Cataclysm2.0 or not that ridiculus
[15:42:03] swervity82: I just wasn't blown away... i Just didn't feel like it was enough information to make a good opinion yet
[15:42:04] ezprit07: When it will be released?
[15:42:06] Eraste: ah, tru, denathrius was a good one
[15:42:06] jmalmin: We do not know anything abut the story or what is going to happen yet. We got a interesting cinematic that did not explain much other then the lifebinder got superspeed.
[15:42:13] Adamantyum: @Towelliee How good do you think the crafting gears going to be?
[15:42:15] Drizz_36: I'm pretty sure 2.0 came out in 2006 🤔
[15:42:15] ManneehFresh: I came back during Shadowlands and quit because of it lol
[15:42:22] Toon_irl: @swervity82 agreed
[15:42:26] Skylin3r: this is wow 10.0
[15:42:34] jason_tacey: World of Warcraft:  Magni-flight
[15:42:47] Skorb: I dunno why, I was really hoping for a persistant housing system of some kind. FeelsBadMan
[15:42:51] aleksmetha: How u line the estatic of the new race?
[15:42:55] TheItalianStallion321: i was at work i missed the whole thing.....
[15:43:04] rickjacey: To be honest i dislike the dragonkin character how it looks like
[15:43:07] cazhually: hahahah
[15:43:07] Austei: LOL
[15:43:08] cazhually: yep
[15:43:12] CrunkyBrewster: YUP
[15:43:13] Eraste: im done with raiding and dungeons but i hope theres interesting stuff to do in 10.0
[15:43:15] luckfore: thats sad
[15:43:21] Austei: plz no 18months
[15:43:25] Drizz_36: hopefully 10.0 prepatch will be sooner than that
[15:43:29] cazhually: ugh gotta do this raid again tonight lol
[15:43:33] Puffzul: Havinge these talent trees is also much easier for Blizz to add new talents in future patches/xpax as well adjust and balance existing @Towelliee
[15:43:38] cazhually: what can they launch early?
[15:43:49] Skylin3r: pre-patch probebly
[15:43:49] zechetto: @towelliee The pre patch will probably be a big mess
[15:43:50] Shallo1988: lots of time to level alts lol
[15:43:50] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[15:43:50] leanborre: they will on prepatch i presume
[15:43:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: The talent stuff could be in the pre-patch, they did that with Legion I think
[15:43:54] yunitoYuniro: Pre patch Xmas I say lol.
[15:43:54] jason_tacey: I was rolling blunts at work so I am trying to catch up on the news.
[15:43:54] CrunkyBrewster: it doesnt look much of anything
[15:43:58] gimmlay: im sure blizzard has to be ahead of schedule with how much they cut from shadowlands
[15:44:02] nelorixx: the race/class
[15:44:06] Orion280: just realised they can't give the class early cause of that reason either
[15:44:11] Leapswitch: i already wanna paly dracthyr man
[15:44:16] Scoodles91: best case scenario, the new talent system is in pre patch
[15:44:19] Puffzul: Havinge these talent trees is also much easier for Blizz to add new talents in future patches/xpax as well adjust and balance existing
[15:44:20] Coriollis: @yunitoYuniro late nov, so they can proly have a feb release
[15:44:21] Darkalex175: given that they have another season planned, we are in shadowlands for the long haul
[15:44:21] swervity82: @Towelliee so i missed it what about Wrath classic other than Grp finder being removed was going to make it so much better?
[15:44:28] aleksmetha: How u like the estatic of the new race?
[15:44:33] Remiix_o: fuck it. just overhaul it all in 9.2.5 and drop covenant power. and give us talent trees to go ahead and start testing the foundation
[15:44:34] luckfore: It looks like the zones are pretty far in development already and systems are still very early
[15:44:37] CycnusJones: I honestly never understood why they went away from the "talent tree" system in the first place.
[15:44:37] pereadin: It’s the first healer hero class
[15:44:41] pereadin: I’m so excited
[15:44:47] snipsfan: left out
[15:44:52] abracka_: they have the easy opportunity to add a tank to it w earthwarder or something
[15:44:52] Alyad: I wonder if torgast will be available in next expansion(for leveling ? or just fun)
[15:44:54] Toon_irl: @gimmlay one thing I've learned in 15+ years of WoW is that blizz is never ahead of schedule lol
[15:44:54] snipsfan: :(
[15:44:55] Shifty_CZ: elloStop
[15:44:55] pereadin: MW doesn’t count KEKW
[15:44:56] Coriollis: idk they need to Sonic the dragon forms till release xD
[15:44:57] cdk058: there should be a black dragon tank spec
[15:44:59] Kalym117: same @pereadin !
[15:45:00] Chelidda: CycnusJones chelid1Wave bamHeart
[15:45:01] Sollice: Nah a mail healer/ranged DPS is a good combo
[15:45:01] Puffzul: Having these talent trees is also much easier for Blizz to add new talents in future patches/xpax as well adjust and balance existing
[15:45:04] Bloodseeker1604: its first ranged hero class ever
[15:45:05] Blindsir: well its also the first time a new class came with a range dps, so lets rejoice for them
[15:45:07] Lif3l3ss: definately needed a range spec
[15:45:10] malthus1: can we tell if the drakthyr will show armor wheb shifted?
[15:45:10] Daggerstry: Not every class/race needs to have a tank
[15:45:11] Layercake: HahaThink
[15:45:13] CycnusJones: Chelidda <3
[15:45:13] enux337: you never know they might make a old class have a tank spec
[15:45:14] Scoodles91: towelliee reroloing to dps, confirmed :D
[15:45:22] OnePlayerPete: Evokers can fly without a mount apparently.
[15:45:24] lithium364: the describtion also says medium range
[15:45:25] swervity82: I want to see how it differs from a resto Druid
[15:45:28] Remiix_o: monks are angry right now
[15:45:37] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Puffzul (warning)
[15:45:38] rickjacey: Well i dont really know why they dont make dragonkin tank spec - they are so mascular totally fine to being a tank character - a tank dragon - kinda from Dota 2 dragonknight
[15:45:41] luckfore: any info on pre order yet?
[15:45:41] gimmlay: maybe with the new talent tree we might get evasion tanking back pog lol
[15:45:46] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee Ele shamans going *chuckle* "My gear is in danger!"
[15:45:49] Sollice: Chat- why don't I know this. Will Dragon race ONLY be able to be Evoker? Or can you play them with different classes
[15:45:51] TacDuc: It's wrong not to give it a tank spec, as it would fit with black dragons, and dragon scales are usually pretty tough to break through
[15:45:51] rickjacey: I really disapointed that they forgot that possibility
[15:45:54] Dongtanian: towelliee + 4 dragons every dungeon week 1
[15:45:56] cazhually: man im surprised no preorder
[15:45:59] cazhually: thats a feels bad
[15:46:03] xxsargexx: kinda weird the healing spec for the evoker doesnt have red magic you know since Alexstraza is the lifebinder and all
[15:46:07] Darthyrevan: patternception
[15:46:11] zein49: @Towelliee How did you get that mount?
[15:46:13] Daggerstry: Shamans and Hunters are both mad
[15:46:13] lithium364: @Sollice only this class
[15:46:14] jaina8675309: if you do the pvp quest you get 35 to it
[15:46:14] cdk058: @Sollice as for now only evoker
[15:46:18] Sollice: Ok ty
[15:46:19] TheItalianStallion321: @Sollice yes from what i believe
[15:46:28] enux337: fire mage tank spec
[15:46:30] cazhually: should've just done tank/heal/ranged
[15:46:30] Daggerstry: Have we seen if we get to play Black Dragons? I didn't see them in the cinematic
[15:46:34] tedol: @luckfore  achievement already there, so soon
[15:46:36] abracka_: we gotta pressure them for it
[15:46:39] kumarjenkins: @Towelliee  You think Wotlk classic will have more changes and come out Sept/Oct?
[15:46:41] swordart2022: COPIUM OD
[15:46:43] TacDuc: I want to cry, as I play all tanks
[15:46:52] HaloS23: @Towelliee maybe a later patch or expansion feature?
[15:46:55] dracullus: they just picked ranged/heal because dh was melee/tank
[15:46:55] Trif0ld: I mean they added guardian druid so many years after feral druid was established so its always possible
[15:47:00] Remiix_o: there does need to be a mail tank. but then you'd be the only mail tank
[15:47:04] Daggerstry: So does Wrathion comes back in Dragonflight?
[15:47:10] xxsargexx: yes
[15:47:15] rickjacey: Beacuse they could add 2 spec - evoker + dragonkight
[15:47:15] xReadyAimMissx: danCopium
[15:47:16] lithium364: one of the interviews said they started on the new class before they started with the actual expansion
[15:47:19] Rexialiton: What color is it going to be?
[15:47:23] Croxssis: could always do a seperate glass called earthwarder or something too
[15:47:27] Eraste: but who knows what they can do now if they arent wasting their time on stuff like conduits or azerite gear
[15:47:33] TheGiant99: Why would they when they diodnt add to Demon Hunter or Death Knight
[15:47:34] Sari_lel: It's good that we got a range + healer
[15:47:35] tydrennistv: i wish they would of done instant cast class like hunters
[15:47:35] rickjacey: Totally fine i guess  - evoker ranged dd + healer - Dragonkinght  - tank
[15:47:37] WayneG947: i dont understand their thinking behind the specs. one is a fire mage with some frost spells, the other is a druid? I havent really seen much about them though tbf
[15:47:41] Sari_lel: We got meele + tank last time
[15:47:44] aleksmetha: Only thing i missed a bit is dungeons and raid. And kinda the enemy we sre fighting
[15:47:45] Puffzul: Funny how people already complain about evoker on forums not even seen gameplay lol
[15:47:47] unowncreature: Doesn't make sense imo to be a dragon and can't tank?
[15:47:51] Chiraakitteh: @trif0ld Except feral could always tank just better after vanilla ended
[15:47:52] Trif0ld: when did they do it for guardian druid @Towelliee
[15:47:55] Balkep: it's interesting that they called the new class a hybrid class - makes me wonder if there's indeed a tank spec possibility but they haven't revealed it yet
[15:47:55] Daggerstry: @Towelliee Didn't they change around DK talent trees from frost being tank to blood being tank mid ICC?
[15:48:00] tydrennistv: do you think they will do what they did in legion pre patch give us them early
[15:48:07] swordart2022: interview in hour ?
[15:48:09] Trif0ld: @Chiraakitteh true true
[15:48:16] enux337: black dragon tank spec
[15:48:30] BfAleTitan: there are 6 healers too
[15:48:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: wonder what the racials are gonna be
[15:48:31] ewoksmoonwalks: tank with black dragon magic wouldve been perfect for the 5 dragon magics concept they were talking about with the spells
[15:48:33] Myndjestyr: last 2 hero classes were both tanks, neither healer
[15:48:34] lithium364: i feel like this was the last class were getting in the next 10 years monkaS
[15:48:34] tragx: But we also have 6 healers already
[15:48:34] gimmlay: i wonder who is going to be the big baddie...  probly nzoth
[15:48:36] neverluckyhehexd: hasnt every new class had a tank spec
[15:48:36] TacDuc: He was a tank, we had to sacrifice the dragon aspects to an artifact to make a weapon that could pierce his scales
[15:48:36] MxViolet: balancing tanks is tough enough lol
[15:48:37] cdk058: no more so i dont have to wait half hour on a tank all the time
[15:48:38] Phoxzy: How many people instantly started reserving their dragon names from Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones
[15:48:39] Snabido: They leaving the next tank to be Earth Shaman spec CoolCat
[15:48:41] Tyrou: @Towelliee they mentioned every dragonflight in the description of the evoker except the black dragonflight
[15:48:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe cook food without a fire using your breath LUL
[15:48:45] yunitoYuniro: The tank spec would be a extra dlc
[15:48:47] rickjacey: But the dragonknight so badass :)
[15:48:51] pereadin: Yeah but he wanted to be the only tank so he made the drakthyr casters and didn’t teach them the ways of dragon tanking KEKW
[15:48:51] MxViolet: making sure they all are viabl
[15:48:56] Sandillian: Hasnt every new spec added a tank?
[15:49:00] anowscaliss: at least it's a mail wear and not leather
[15:49:04] tedol: DLC for wow, haha
[15:49:05] Trif0ld: also this class looks quite mobile so having another mobile tank hurts viability of less mobile tanks
[15:49:12] Puffzul: So little content revealed, definitely 2023 release
[15:49:15] aleksmetha: Only thing i missed a bit is dungeons and raid. And kinda the enemy we sre fighting
[15:49:20] Remiix_o: well. every hero class has added a tank and a melee spec. so it's def time to skip both
[15:49:27] tydrennistv: do you think it will be dh easy?
[15:49:30] TacDuc: It looked like an HoT and AoE healer
[15:49:35] Shallo1988: any word on 9.2.5 launch?
[15:49:38] BoiAtomico: you don't have to have access to the new everything on everything fam, most of ya'll being pricks with the "WY NO TANK", the why is because they didnt want another tank, easy enough
[15:49:39] rickjacey: Wonder if the healing spec will be similar to the Alextrasa from HoTS
[15:49:46] swordart2022: you wil know by playing EZ
[15:49:46] Drizz_36: @Shallo1988, no news
[15:49:55] BfAleTitan: concepts, so grain of salt
[15:49:59] Shallo1988: @Drizz_36 kk ty
[15:49:59] Voramir: incoming black dragon and bronze dragon magic tank spec as a second spec
[15:50:00] cdk058: isnt that concept?
[15:50:01] luckfore: concept art looks awesome, but so did the progenitor concept art..
[15:50:14] wpee86: Isnt they missing a class set+
[15:50:15] assman_ny: I like that DH look too
[15:50:15] pereadin: Race change to what?
[15:50:16] Balkep: which race then?
[15:50:20] luckfore: the flame tauren looked cool
[15:50:21] BfAleTitan: yea after the concepts for the current tier it doesn't really mean anything
[15:50:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: It probably looks good on Tauren
[15:50:24] HaloS23: @Towelliee maybe just add them as a allied race. keep the racials but loose the evoker part. Could make sense story wise. like they discover what mortals are about and renounce their creation intents and become other classes.... it could happen
[15:50:30] Krait06: gonna look sweet on a zandalri troll
[15:50:37] Coriollis: yeah the concept is awesome but idk how will translate in game
[15:50:37] Snabido: Different case for you too tho - you're on a tauren, mog will be different 😏
[15:50:41] Armdel: the thing is almost no helmets look good on Tauren
[15:50:41] funKShun: tauren has the worst models
[15:50:55] danielthegathering: what is cosmic dmg
[15:50:59] KyleEverett: I'm praying the reason they don't have an black earth tank is to keep Earthwarden for Shaman tank spec later.
[15:51:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: The special Zereth Mortis gear only works in the zone, but yeah I think it procs a fair amount
[15:51:39] swordart2022: COPIUM inhale
[15:51:39] Daggerstry: @Towelliee Do you think Archaeology will play a BIG role as a tertiary profession since we are visiting an isle isolated for 10k years?
[15:51:40] gimmlay: he KNOWS
[15:51:43] CrunkyBrewster: Dude I would be down for Shaman Tanking
[15:51:46] CrunkyBrewster: oh
[15:51:50] tragx: Oh damn
[15:51:50] CrunkyBrewster: well then no LULW
[15:51:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, shaman would need a taunt
[15:51:58] Snabido: Someone gotten a more indept sneak peek at them trees huh 👀
[15:51:58] CrunkyBrewster: they wont
[15:52:03] abracka_: i would main shaman in a fucking heartbeat if they did that
[15:52:11] pereadin: Nope
[15:52:11] Daggerstry: Shamans were tnks in Classic with Rockbiter weapon
[15:52:14] cdk058: proly not
[15:52:15] Remiix_o: stoneclaw totem was a taunt. just needs to actually work
[15:52:25] swordart2022: you can play
[15:52:25] Aceman120: Did they give a release date
[15:52:27] pereadin: The trifecta is too important to them imo
[15:52:28] jak_gaming: LAWL NA token went from 190K back down to 150
[15:52:28] CrunkyBrewster: that was the fun part for me in early Classic. I got to Shaman tank dungeons
[15:52:29] Coldfire989: They are not going to give shaman a dragon tank spec that would make no sense LUL
[15:52:33] swordart2022: zmok does it already your choice limit yourself.
[15:52:34] BfAleTitan: they can't stop that from happening right now lol
[15:52:35] luckfore: are more WOTLK changes coming or just the lfg removed?
[15:52:38] Trif0ld: hybrid tank healer and one dps hybrids healer as well
[15:52:42] XshadowturkeyX: didnt 1 mdi team in legion do 1 tank 4 dps? 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[15:52:48] Vampthor: buy weps sell for 100 g a pop for 500 anima
[15:52:52] Skylin3r: they'd probebly wouldn't and have the key holy stuff in the spec tree, not the class tree
[15:52:52] KyleEverett: @Coldfire989 Thrall was Earthwarder at one point haha
[15:52:54] Kindosar: healers might be able to spec more aggressive, shockadins, etc
[15:52:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Back in the day the shaman had earthbiter weapon ability to taunt, but I think they would really need an AOE taunt these days
[15:53:01] abracka_: depends on if you're gonna actually do the ember court
[15:53:02] ShadyBotanist66: Imo the idea should be completing dungeons how you want but top level should be assertive when it comes to Tank heal 3 dps
[15:53:05] swordart2022: Buy all cosmetics EZ
[15:53:10] ShadyBotanist66: and ofc you can mix match 20m mythic
[15:53:25] rizw0w: Do you have all the grateful offerings?
[15:53:43] wpee86: U probly run out of OFferings first
[15:53:55] Shallo1988: so which 10.0 tier sets look good towel? how did you find them?
[15:54:02] rizw0w: it will be a good chunk, but probably not all :'(
[15:54:08] Scorpionlaw: no need aloy more
[15:54:18] cranjismcbasketball069: No player power on renown or the dragon thing makes me more interested than I would be.  If I'm raiding I'd like to not have to worry about logging in outside of raid after the first  few weeks of progression
[15:54:30] Shallo1988: wowww
[15:54:34] Darkalex175: that set reminds me of t11 pally

[15:54:39] Vampthor: whats dks look like
[15:54:39] DramaticTv: @Towelliee any idea when preorders will be out?
[15:54:41] dracullus: anima is now completely account wide, so if you have lot of 60 alts you can just do 500 anima world quests once a week
[15:54:41] Buckwink: which is which I cant tell lol
[15:54:44] KyleEverett: If all healers can talent into kicks for dungeons that'll be amazing
[15:54:47] Skylin3r: is that the warrior to the right of it?
[15:54:48] arturiuss44: ther one on the right reminds me of the armor in outsiders
[15:54:49] ItsEddieAU: tiny head looks like hasan
[15:54:54] impuls3fiv3: Better than current tier set
[15:54:55] swordart2022: IT reminds me that dude from Starcraft with Space HELM
[15:54:56] KyleEverett: Mage

[15:54:59] Casiope7: mage?
[15:55:01] Gwendabella: mage
[15:55:01] wpee86: mage
[15:55:02] abracka_: demon hunter?
[15:55:05] CrunkyBrewster: Yeah I like the Hunter one. Finally we get a decent looking set
[15:55:05] Daggerstry: That one is hunter
[15:55:11] dyslexican1: He looks dope AF! He looks like a glowy Juggernaut!
[15:55:13] pereadin: I mean what’s your top #1 favorite set of all time lol
[15:55:15] Vampthor: all em looks pretty good
[15:55:22] arturiuss44: sorry outriders armor
[15:55:25] Moonphire: Thanks so much for doing this hypu stream today towel, lovin' it
[15:55:27] TacDuc: The first could be evoker
[15:55:30] Skylin3r: warrior kinda looks like TBC set
[15:55:32] Shallo1988: monk looks dope
[15:55:33] uglla3np: kinda looks like owerwatch art
[15:55:38] FrostyySnapps: DH?
[15:55:52] pereadin: What time we starting bro?
[15:55:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY

[15:56:24] Aidric23: Aidric23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[15:56:30] danielthegathering: why is the rio towards 3k now?
[15:56:31] cranjismcbasketball069: Do we know the new dungeons?
[15:56:34] pereadin: Oh yeah EZ 3K we’ll need a few 21s or 22s but should be good.
[15:56:44] danielthegathering: why does it increase with every season?
[15:56:54] TheGiant99: What does beiong 3000 get you 󠀀
[15:56:54] Skylin3r: what do you get for hitting 3k?
[15:57:08] Plague_GG: 278 conduits
[15:57:10] KyleEverett: 3000 is 278 conduits
[15:57:11] pereadin: Easiest of the weeks.
[15:57:14] danielthegathering: @Stopnsmellmynutz get out
[15:57:15] crypticnightwing21: @Towelliee do you plan on checking out the new ESO expanision when it drops?
[15:57:33] Balkep: @Stopnsmellmynutz why?
[15:57:33] pereadin: The next 3 weeks are also easy for pushing according to JPC
[15:57:58] darkeagle7561: is alpha usually streamable, I dont remember?
[15:58:07] Unstoppable1222: I hope they reinstate Challenge mode for cosmetic ONLY and regular mythic dungeons all drop slightly inferior gear to whatever the current raid is except for the final boss of each mythic
[15:58:37] danielthegathering: without m+ i wouldnt even touch wow
[15:58:37] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee wonder if Hearth Kidneystone will work in Dragonflight
[15:58:40] CrunkyBrewster: yup you get lost from not playing
[15:58:56] Maytan26: so is lich king + not a thing?
[15:58:57] Skylin3r: lookup a god build for it, and face roll shit
[15:59:08] KyleEverett: I'm hoping the new crafting system raises the ilvl floor each season
[15:59:17] Kapatha: @Towelliee you mentionned 6 months pre-purchase for new expansion ..given we are in April and USA has thanksgiving nov and xmas dec ..would that be a good estimate for release ?
[15:59:21] oldaccount_oldaccount: how's wild star doing
[15:59:24] Maytan26: i remember i got into rift because of you
[15:59:25] tragx: I love ESO, but the combat system always makes me quit after a while
[15:59:25] MxViolet: Wow Ryft, havent heard that name in forever
[15:59:50] TacDuc: That would be a bit stupid
[15:59:51] Sollice: It should not be better but on par
[15:59:54] ColdIceCreamMan: maybe one pieve
[16:00:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess that profession gear would top out at heroic raid level
[16:00:05] Maytan26: wildstar and rift should have not died
[16:00:05] Skylin3r: buck in the day raids would drop recipes
[16:00:09] cranjismcbasketball069: Making profession gear just for transmog would be a good call
[16:00:12] Croxssis: i think it should at least be able to fill the gap between aquiring that gear. would ease bad luck a bit
[16:00:18] Taantrum1: make professions to add +5 to raid gear
[16:00:23] Phantom_wulfstan: @Stopnsmellmynutz good luck with that i guess lol
[16:00:46] Remiix_o: the quality of gear is my large concern for Dragonflight. I really don't wanna another big RNG system back into gear. feels like we just got rid of titanforging still
[16:00:54] Chiraakitteh: The only hard thing with getting back into eso is them constantly changing the CP systems and refunding all the points... at least there is a way to save those builds now. Still some weird design choices with it tho.
[16:00:56] Sollice: Crafting is never going to feel good if its only viable for a few weeks
[16:00:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Profession quests and items are cool
[16:01:11] Sollice: Alchemy is really the only one that stays in demand forever at higher costs isnt it?
[16:02:13] darkeagle7561: Are legendaries back for the expac?
[16:02:16] yuvalal: what weapon do you think the new class/race will use ?
[16:02:25] Sollice: @darkeagle7561 No news on them being in expansion
[16:02:40] lithium364: they said the good crafting materials will be bound so you cant just wow token them
[16:02:41] darkeagle7561: @Sollice gotcha, thanks
[16:03:03] Weegleman: you have to forget it the the flames of actual dragons breath!
[16:03:06] MxViolet: I think crafting tables would be cool
[16:03:09] Weegleman: forge*
[16:03:23] denflup: LUL
[16:03:27] Alaquane: you have to mind control the goblin to teach you how to make ingots
[16:03:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: True!
[16:03:34] Skylin3r: ppl will sell lockouts for it
[16:03:47] Sollice: Make the same gear craftable. You use a raid bench its a higher ilvl than a free work bench
[16:03:48] FrostyySnapps: so dumb
[16:03:53] denflup: bfa have those quests as well
[16:03:55] denflup: for alchemy
[16:04:01] TacDuc: WHAT?!?!?! Farming in an MMORPG
[16:04:09] common_taco: damn they're making me play the game. how could they
[16:04:15] daegoh: it goes both ways raiders complained about world quests in BFA
[16:04:16] dyslexican1: I think that falls under, listening to the wrong people who complain alot.
[16:04:23] denflup: yes, you needed items from dungeons
[16:04:23] Aidler: don’t raid besides lfr so I don’t craft
[16:04:36] Eraste: ya had to do waycrest to unlock anchor weed upgrade
[16:04:41] Maytan26: honestly i don't think this expansion will release before august next year
[16:04:42] arturiuss44: Like going to thunder isle to craft armor for blacksmithing for thunderforge that was good too.
[16:04:50] MxViolet: when is the interivew??
[16:04:52] the_hessman: If people wanna complain about grinding they should never try diablo
[16:04:57] HaloS23: @Towelliee give me alot of hope. ditched all profs to just do mine/herb.... just to make some sort of money...
[16:04:59] Atokiri: i still remember the islands, the only problems, they were timed and used for faction war PepeHands
[16:05:03] Sollice: @Maytan26 There is no way its going to take until 8/23
[16:05:05] lithium364: i dont think the profession rework will cater to raiders, its probably an way to aquire good gear long term for casuals
[16:05:06] MxViolet: kk ty
[16:05:57] zechetto: professions have been useless the last couple expansions
[16:06:08] Snabido: We already have feast spams everywhere, im sure we'll survive
[16:06:14] Alaquane: can test it right now with vulpera putting down their camps
[16:06:20] N3llee: @zechetto clearly didnt play shadowlands
[16:06:21] Funderik: i don't that's what they meant by crafting tables, they said around the city, meaning they are perm fixtures
[16:06:22] lithium364: if they make BiS weapons craftable like in bc im sold
[16:06:26] Skylin3r: add transmog skins to crafts, that require special matirials not easily obtained
[16:06:31] TheGiant99: I cant wait to see the wow haters like stoopz reract to wow being good again 󠀀
[16:06:32] Fleymour: just add that into the AH as service tab ^^ 󠀀
[16:06:35] ShadyBotanist66: They have it on PSes
[16:06:36] EFFSIN: look at minecraft
[16:06:38] EFFSIN: it dont lag
[16:06:41] ShadyBotanist66: It wont be too much imo
[16:06:50] Snabido: Valdraka? Idk

[16:07:18] Sollice: Yes AH in new hub city
[16:07:18] TobeyT85: Val Kilmer
[16:07:22] Gamepoint95: Whats your favourite tank in 9.2?

[16:08:12] Ziephier: have to wonder BDO just came with a new class - Drakania - maybe decedent of a dragon and a new region
[16:08:44] lilwird_o7: lag in the crafting area will be laggy af
[16:08:54] Weegleman: I'm stoked for dos blood tank from WLK Kreygasm miss healing myself and having to worry about healer less.

[16:11:31] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will there be more humanoid options for the dragon race? seems weird how it's male Blood Elf and female human?
[16:11:36] Rorill: No
[16:11:46] emilools: yea, it would be cool, but it would invaldiate all other mounts @Towelliee
[16:11:48] Rorill: they said no in french interview with judgehype @Towelliee
[16:11:52] bigoldmeatpie: interview said dragonflight zones only

[16:13:40] darkeagle7561: Who is Sylvannas? Kappa
[16:13:40] zechetto: The dragon flight really reminded me of the Batman Arkham games...
[16:13:41] tino49: so the removal of LFD is what you called "big changes" in wrath classic ?  @Towelliee
[16:13:41] danielthegathering: 11.0 Sylvanas Return

[16:16:03] Naturalbeef: I think I’m most excited to get an alt to 70 and just be able to jump in to content. No farming additional power
[16:16:04] sainstrife: So many plp are pissed that RDF is not in wrath classc it so funny

[16:33:54] FunkyTurtlle: M+ keys may have dungeons from past xpacs like they will in the next patch. thus giving you a larger rooster to chose from and not needing to double down on more dungeons up front
[16:33:56] Reed5o: hello sir
[16:34:00] Grunton: and if they are revamped
[16:34:00] Moonori: maybe those old ones are revamps?
[16:34:01] warlockyone: M+ is stupid... it's welfare gear
[16:34:03] uglla3np: full maraudon +15
[16:34:04] saltyohm: some stuff on mmochamp
[16:34:04] madmike_99: Honestly, just open M+ to literally all dungeons in the game LUL Like FFXIV
[16:34:04] swordart2022: Gonna complain about it in Alpha/Beta
[16:34:04] Kneckt: ASAP? o.o
[16:34:06] KingSpud91: thats still kinda shit though? what if you have a bis m+ item thats not currently in the seasonal rotation?
[16:34:07] deathanubis923: great vault 2.0 renown 2.0 and the new talent tree looks like conduit 2.0
[16:34:08] Moonphire: Grim Batrol cause...dragons
[16:34:08] Snabido: Maw of Souls farm Kappa
[16:34:09] Xsidious: so does this mean 4 old dungeons are getting a revamp??
[16:34:11] Maex: @Towelliee  link plz ?
[16:34:11] KPable: wrath dungs i am sure
[16:34:11] E_mark: the return of the seagulls from legion 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[16:34:14] thomaspxo: or it is just shrinking loot table. so we have no gear choice
[16:34:18] Ceekayn_: 2023
[16:34:19] Jolymph: maybe the old azeroth dungeon featured in M+ will be revamped ?
[16:34:19] FantumWitch: lol watch one of the old ones be stonecore
[16:34:25] DramaticTv: pre orders wwwwhhhhheeeeeennnn
[16:34:28] SonofHorus82: did I miss them talking about the glorious return of Archaeology and how it's going to be better than ever?
[16:34:33] BullDevil: Mythic+ BRD, 2 hour timer
[16:34:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the mobs would need to scale with mythic keys

[16:34:43] thecynicalshuffler: M+ BRD... lololololol
[16:34:45] guesswhofoo: 2024 confirmed
[16:34:49] MrKray2: I like the idea of having different dungeons on different seasons
[16:34:55] Alaquane: @SonofHorus82 they said they aren't touching archaeology
[16:34:55] mitchumtx: Towelliee, there is also a new WOWHEAD
[16:34:55] Shrenko: soon ™️
[16:34:56] xsp00n: shac20 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[16:34:59] Moonphire: What's that WOTLK dungeon everyone hated so much that had you fly on dragons ?
[16:35:00] Xsidious: wouldnt mind revamping classic dungeons
[16:35:01] danimoto10: whyyyy do they always need to fuck it up
[16:35:04] miguelapple: mythic+ stockades 50M hp hogger
[16:35:08] Ponzie: Anyone have a link to this article?
[16:35:14] RuebeHD: @Moonphire the eye?
[16:35:16] drunch85: Towelliee a mythic +20 RFC Kappa
[16:35:17] SonofHorus82: @SonofHorus82 towCry
[16:35:20] HalrykOfStormrage: @Moonphire Oculus
[16:35:20] propwash80: YO mithic scholo
[16:35:21] Remiix_o: I don't want to have any old, loved dungeons ruined for me because of them failing to revamp it in a good way for m+
[16:35:24] raye_gaming22: mop dungeons allready have the design from CMs
[16:35:24] warlockyone: M+ Elfare Gear needs to be nerfed
[16:35:25] Alaquane: it's the judgehype interview
[16:35:28] toobaked1987: Towelliee on a scale for 1 to 420 blaze it. What is your level of excitement? What are some concerns?
[16:35:30] Moonphire: Oculus!
[16:35:31] guesswhofoo: Yo mr T. WhT you meant by this xpac 10.0 different ?
[16:35:36] swordart2022: I think taht is some bullshit not having at least 8 new dungeons
[16:35:38] Moonphire: Thanks @HalrykOfStormrage
[16:35:38] sainstrife: M+ Scholamacer
[16:35:40] KushDaddy03: I think having a rotation every week of different dungeons is gonna be nice
[16:35:40] SonofHorus82: Need tank for M20 Classic ST
[16:35:42] JayBoost: @danimoto10 cant make everyone happy
[16:35:43] Phantom_wulfstan: @miguelapple what cursed shit did you just bring into this chat?
[16:35:59] lumaday: 4 dungeons is wild
[16:35:59] Jolymph: I hope they bring more heritage armor
[16:35:59] TobeyT85: mythic oculus MingLee
[16:36:02] Jakesrevenge16: i think it makes more sense for that to be a season 2 thing. let season 1 be all the new dungeons
[16:36:02] KushDaddy03: its so they can introduce new dungeons each patch likely
[16:36:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: mythic+ Wailing caverns
[16:36:05] uglla3np: to revamp all old dungeons for future plans
[16:36:06] snipsfan: I love the idea of having some old dungeons in rotation or whatever but I was hoping for more than 4 NEW dungeons
[16:36:07] D0cBrown: well, crunch, covid, people leaving etc. .. I think it acutally is time
[16:36:07] faulen: I think it is good. People tend to get sick of the dungeons by the end of the xpac
[16:36:08] spainard15: So they can focus on other things maybe?
[16:36:09] Alaquane: if only 4 dungeons, pump it out faster
[16:36:09] Dongtanian: imagine depleting a stockades key
[16:36:10] mitchumtx: not 4 dungeons at launch! just during the mythic+ season
[16:36:12] Snabido: Prolly the feedback of repeating same dungeons over the exp? idk
[16:36:13] tydrennistv: how much gold do you think you will need goinginto this expac?
[16:36:14] zynki: they work less
[16:36:17] Hitokiri83: less burnout possibly
[16:36:17] swordart2022: fuck that
[16:36:18] Radiag: this could mean that a bunch of release dungeons dont get m+
[16:36:19] danimoto10: @danimoto10 but this is pretty dumb
[16:36:20] Maytan26: i think old dungeons will be redone or something?
[16:36:22] unowncreature: probably to shake things up so it doesn't feel stale?
[16:36:23] KisShadi: people get bored to grind the same 8 dungeons for the entire expac
[16:36:23] D3m0nHunt3r666: Spending resources in other stuff, and they seeing how it pans out
[16:36:25] PineKnot85: what site this on?
[16:36:25] luckfore: it sounds like there are 8 dungeons no?
[16:36:27] Skorb: setting the bar low 󠀀
[16:36:29] D3m0nHunt3r666: then*
[16:36:29] Spibi_: to keep it fresh always not same 8 dg's for 2 years straight
[16:36:29] MerffTV: Probably eight dungoens at launch for leveling, but only half of them in Season 1 for keys. Then switch. Makes sense.
[16:36:31] Sertrunku: so that you have different dungoens in seasons, so it doesnt get repetetive
[16:36:32] HalrykOfStormrage: HalrykOfStormrage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[16:36:34] 24sevn: should've been 8 new and 4 remakes
[16:36:34] E_mark: Im thinking by old they mean the dungs that allready M+ designs. I dono what 'old' would entail 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[16:36:34] Merex760: maybe they want to space out dungeon content to last longer. Not give most of it at the start
[16:36:36] Brenndon: Probably because there are a milliion dungeons in the game that nobody uses.
[16:36:37] Utmost777: @Towelliee maybe something to do with the Bronze Dragons?
[16:36:38] FatalSmite: @towelliee m+ community been asking to not farm same gear multiple seasons in a row
[16:36:42] Urebaldd: I'm waiting for more info but at least I won't have to do a 20 streets again
[16:36:44] Herzenliegen: I'm thinking it's going to be old dragon dungeons but even so not a fan of old
[16:36:50] UltraContent: the flight speed improvement looks very good
[16:36:50] avinater: could be to release the game faster
[16:36:50] OnePlayerPete: More time to develop new dungeons, smart.
[16:36:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Maybe they don't want to force people to run 10 dungeons a week? I think it depends on how the vault works
[16:36:53] warlockyone: Blizzard realized that M+ was a welfare gear system
[16:36:57] Wellfleet: Where is @Towelliee reading that?  Can we get a URL?
[16:36:57] miguelapple: keep things fresh
[16:36:58] zenkaigo_: would be nice if they made some outlanding dungeons not aimed at being m+
[16:37:01] victoryz22: keep season 1 all new blizz
[16:37:01] Aidler: @towelliee naguura wanted that so that new dungeons can be added along the way
[16:37:03] Grunton: have old comtent be relavant and not a push over would be fun
[16:37:07] MrKray2: I think it would reduce burnout, giving the seasons more variety
[16:37:09] Ghettoskippy: I would def say its for the nostalgia chasers who want older content to be relevant
[16:37:10] faulen: I think it is good. People tend to get sick of the dungeons by the end of the xpac 󠀀
[16:37:13] MerffTV: I can also see them revamping more classic-era dungeons into keys.
[16:37:14] abracka_: anyone got a link
[16:37:14] Xsidious: revamp classic dungeons would be nice
[16:37:17] bowsers1: can i have the link off this ?
[16:37:31] danimoto10: yep
[16:37:34] MattJ063: MattJ063 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[16:37:36] OnePlayerPete: Also 10.X patches will be better with new dungeons
[16:37:38] RealSolaroid: What'd I miss?
[16:37:38] toobaked1987: Towelliee on a scale for 1 to 420 blaze it. What is your level of excitement? What are some concerns?
[16:37:40] hypno7iq: Wrath > Dragonflight
[16:37:41] DuransHybrid: where was that written?
[16:37:42] Armdel: back to lost ark i guess
[16:37:43] faulen: that's only for m+
[16:37:43] mitchumtx: It's just 4 dungeons for the mythic+ season my guy not at launch
[16:37:43] MerffTV: He never said that.
[16:37:45] denflup: they will revert  it
[16:37:45] swordart2022: THAT IS SCAM
[16:37:48] Radiag: there could very well be 8 dungeons on release, just 4 of them only during leveling and farming hc at the beginning
[16:37:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: Nope
[16:37:52] zynki: 4 zones?
[16:37:52] Maex: IS ONLY FOR MYTHIC PLUS
[16:37:52] D3m0nHunt3r666: total scam
[16:37:53] uglla3np: to be fair the old ones are revamped so kinda new
[16:37:54] papascruge: I'm pretty sure it's saying 8 total only 4 will be in rotation
[16:37:55] xaeblue: @Towelliee Do you think they're going for quality>quantity?
[16:37:56] swordart2022: ALl guys whine on beta/alpha with that crap so they revert it back
[16:37:56] MerffTV: Could be eight for leveling at launch
[16:37:57] danimoto10: they have like a year+ to work on it. dont fuck it up
[16:37:57] Maytan26: 4 redone dungeons will be okay
[16:37:59] TheLoho: @Towelliee it has to be 8 dungeons on release, only 4 are eligible for M+ Season 1.
[16:37:59] Xsilentghost: are tou watching bajeraas interview in 5 min
[16:37:59] Ichiban__GG: Maybe we have 8 but only 4 for Mythic so we dont get bored of the new ones in season2?
[16:38:03] TheGiant99: @Towelliee that was only mythic plus
[16:38:06] MerffTV: and using on some for keys initially
[16:38:06] zulway_: honestly i am fine with this
[16:38:09] KingSpud91: probably 8 dungeons on launch but theyll have some sort of m+ rotation?
[16:38:11] mitchumtx: It's ONLY for MYTHIC+ Y'all not at launch
[16:38:11] OctopusBailey: Surely it's 8 new dungeons, but 4 for S1 M+, then the other 4 for S2 M+
[16:38:12] denery_zk: you need to read correctly
[16:38:14] Durk101: mmo-champion has new stuff
[16:38:16] XshadowturkeyX: 4 new dungoens, what if they all are mega dungeons? 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[16:38:19] D3m0nHunt3r666: 2 dungeons rework is okay, 4 is a little too much.
[16:38:19] Herzenliegen: I hoping you get the 8 but only 4 for mythic
[16:38:20] Splashdownn: @Towelliee thats why we'll get beta to provide feedback
[16:38:20] MerffTV: right
[16:38:20] zulway_: guess it depends on what the 4 old dungeons are?
[16:38:23] danimoto10: if they cant lunch with all 8 then DONT lunch
[16:38:23] Merex760: That is true
[16:38:26] Maex: IS IN THE CATERGORY OF MYTHIC PLUSSSSSSSSSSS  IS NOT FOR LEVELING  ES FOR MYTHIC PLUS
[16:38:26] denflup: if they are set to launch in normal and heroic, they can revert it, unless they are not in development yet, then we are fucked
[16:38:31] Merex760: That's probably what it is
[16:38:31] warlockyone: M+ gear is degenerate
[16:38:44] zeiours: @towelliee are you watching bajerra interview?
[16:38:49] Dreken0: Probably a way to keep the new dungeons relevant for suture expansions
[16:38:49] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: can anyone get into the shop
[16:38:52] Lundrai: Maybe the'll do something like make UBRS and LBRS actually interesting
[16:38:53] bowsers1: maybe the 4 old dungeons are from Classic , that would be Pog
[16:38:56] Reiumi_: PauseChamp
[16:38:56] Jakesrevenge16: that would make more sense for a Season 2 thing. let season 1 be all new dungeons
[16:39:00] xsp00n: They should just let season 1 be season 1, then do this funky shit in season2 onwards
[16:39:01] zgag: Got to say this isn't the time for Blizzard to hold anything back for when the Xpac first comes out.  They want to hit the ground running fast
[16:39:03] Rexialiton: if this makes the game better im fine with it
[16:39:03] Towelliee: https://www.twitch.tv/bajheera
[16:39:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want to hear what they plan for PvP gearing changes
[16:39:12] Remiix_o: I really don't like the concept of splitting up the new m+ dungeons. if anything do all 8 dungeons, and then 8 old dungeons
[16:39:13] Durk101: check mmo-champion
[16:39:13] Maytan26: ask baj to ask this
[16:39:14] Snabido: Maybe not seasonal rotation, perhaps shorter
[16:39:16] the_hessman: I mean didnt we get 4 leveling duns and then 4 more once we hit 60
[16:39:16] sainstrife: M+ is for people who don't want to deal with raid drama stop hateing
[16:39:17] Sarocus: Help him making some gains
[16:39:19] Cidal_: Maybe the other four dungeons come at another patch due to 'story' reasons?
[16:39:20] propwash80: @Towelliee are they making classic dungeons into M+?
[16:39:21] Remiix_o: and then could go back to the new ones again the next season
[16:39:26] toobaked1987: Towelliee on a scale of 1 to 420 blaze it. What is your level of excitement? What are some concerns?
[16:39:30] swordart2022: HOPE we get ION interview to aks him about these dungeons
[16:39:33] Alaquane: Holinka more like Swoleinka
[16:39:40] warlockyone: M+ Gear is welfare gear
[16:39:47] Herzenliegen: They revamped dungeons in the past as well so this i sno new thing. They did it with deadmines
[16:39:48] Aidler: naguura said a mixture of old and new dungeons for the start and then new dungeons with each update. no longer the same 10 dungeons for 2 years
[16:40:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, things are looking bright for 10.0
[16:40:03] Kavieonn: Norton was the most difficult piece of software ive ever tried removing from my PC
[16:40:05] DragonofWolves: It's their gaming anti-virus i think
[16:40:06] Dathas487: This expansion is going to slap no copium
[16:40:07] kumah_1: if blizz has learned their lesson same
[16:40:13] sainstrife: @warlockyone Stop hating
[16:40:19] Urebaldd: @warlockyone Enough, we get it
[16:40:24] SureSquire: What the fuck am I looking at?
[16:40:34] SureSquire: Missed most of the reveal stuff
[16:40:46] Malitor: Total: Talent trees
[16:40:47] swordart2022: that is shit there you go
[16:40:47] Herzenliegen: Jen!
[16:40:50] Aegrial: so the rotation doesnt get old
[16:40:54] xReadyAimMissx: @Total193000 getting ready for Bajheera's interview with a WoW dev

[16:40:58] chickdrummer88: @warlockyone DansGame
[16:40:59] SonofHorus82: Hi Jen!
[16:41:06] SureSquire: This looks like it will be interesting
[16:41:10] lithium364: i wonder what new zones were getting in 10.1 10.2 etc already, seems dragon isles as a kontinetn is quite fleshed out
[16:41:13] SureSquire: Pog
[16:41:14] Zivs: hope so :D
[16:41:16] propwash80: SCHOLO
[16:41:17] Cidal_: Occulus M+
[16:41:18] dinomiyte: dead mines
[16:41:18] Shocklate_: Maybe a mix of BfA/Legion
[16:41:18] daegoh: Tol Dagor
[16:41:18] Aegrial: BFA, LEGION, etc.
[16:41:19] abruptdecayO_O: DEADMINES
[16:41:19] Cidal_: lets go fellas
[16:41:19] RealSolaroid: give us mechagon M+ pls
[16:41:20] Dathas487: MoP dungeons as M+ ez
[16:41:20] toobaked1987: BFA dungs were so damn good!
[16:41:21] egraves7: BRD m+ let's gooooo
[16:41:23] emznev: freehold was soooo good
[16:41:23] Aquadriel: bfa legion and wod has to be @Towelliee
[16:41:24] TheLoho: @Towelliee if I have to go into Deadmines in M+ I'm gonna lose my mind
[16:41:28] zgag: They shouldn't hold back. Blizard shouldn't hold off like they always do.  That has been thier main problem
[16:41:29] TheEmperor30k: +20 Escape from Durnholde but Thrall dies and you have to start over
[16:41:30] Xsidious: Towelliee so are you bringing back Towelliee New World Order?!
[16:41:30] lrddoom: kinda feels lazy of blizzard adding old dungs
[16:41:31] zechetto: That talent tree looks so juicy
[16:41:33] sainstrife: Scarlet Mon
[16:41:35] propwash80: 10 man BRD lol
[16:41:36] Tyrsfal: UBRS M+??
[16:41:38] D3m0nHunt3r666: Its got to be classic before WoD @Towelliee
[16:41:43] Dongtanian: freehold was goated
[16:41:46] Aquadriel: cause older dungeons have to be redesigned for m+
[16:41:53] Herzenliegen: I'd prefer all new but w/e
[16:41:54] Snabido: Shrine of the Storm coming back? 😏
[16:41:59] chickdrummer88: @lrddoom I'd like them to utilize their older content to make it fresh again. A lot of good stuff is just sitting there not being used
[16:41:59] Utmost777: I would be surprised if they did anything older than Legion
[16:42:03] sainstrife: I just want M+ SM
[16:42:07] Kavieonn: NWO was the best
[16:42:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: mythic plus 20 BRD full clear lets go
[16:42:12] Bernardo994: love u baj!!!!
[16:42:20] Herzenliegen: They are coming in low
[16:42:28] SureSquire: Fuck me that would be WILD
[16:42:40] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee are we gonna try to get the Hammer Squad back together or are we letting that go by the wayside because of the douchery?
[16:42:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mythic Razorfen Kraul would be freaking awesome
[16:42:54] Lundrai: Talent trees coming back is the most hype imo
[16:42:58] Rexialiton: Bingo Bango
[16:43:00] Snabido: Do you have pvp stuff on that card
[16:43:04] toobaked1987: I think I am most excited about the talent tree. Of course there will be a meta, but  the style should have never left
[16:43:05] Maytan26: ask baj to ask that mythic + question
[16:43:18] Sellzu: cat ears no man
[16:43:18] Kavieonn: Who is Holinka?
[16:43:25] lrddoom: @chickdrummer88 if they revamp it then id agree
[16:43:30] RealSolaroid: Holinka, my beloved <3
[16:43:30] EFFSIN: so loud
[16:43:30] D3m0nHunt3r666: putuHutao putuHutao putuHutao putuHutao
[16:43:31] MxViolet: Did it just start?
[16:43:35] Balkep: Holynxka
[16:43:35] EFFSIN: good
[16:43:41] DragonofWolves: Shes a CM?
[16:43:42] Warpiercer: >talent trees used to mean something whe leveling was important and every level meant something. Now you can speed run to max level in a day and then icy veins / rio your way out.
