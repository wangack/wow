[1:11:58] ProverbX: @Toiks its 250 something i think, but im just saying, with the most minimal effort you shouldnt have less than 233
[1:11:58] dwolters_the_zombieman: not sure if 239

[1:13:08] Kinghorn: anduin had to be nerfed 100 times
[1:13:10] ashnmsr: like hundred new people joined maybe that helped?
[1:13:17] Kinghorn: literally 100 times
[1:13:27] abracka_: even on heroic anduin killed guilds lol
[1:13:43] ashnmsr: hmm
[1:13:45] Korupcija_: I mean it was meant for echo and liquid so it was a success
[1:13:50] ProverbX: i feel like the first teir will be emerald nightmare level difficulty exept with an actual good end boss
[1:13:54] GoKu1g: I'm one of these weird people that actually liked the Anduin fight
[1:14:00] Kinghorn: heroic anduin was meant for liquid and echo?
[1:14:03] st0nedturk3y: @Towelliee whats the xp bar addon called?

[1:14:39] robbo1010: will you still use ELVUI in expansion / prepatch?
[1:14:41] MindhackerTV: im hoping is a 2 hours race....
[1:14:41] looney199725: @b1z49 dont be upset im just telling you the fact that fragnance cannot carry method to #1
[1:15:05] Kelticlore: i feel the lvl squish we had at start of shadowlands wasnt needed due to chromie time
[1:15:14] b1z49: i didnt say it could i said it helps. if upgrade better raiders in team you got more of a chance no?
[1:15:23] Toiks: mythic start might be slower since they dont have free week in heroic
[1:15:33] N4hr3g: There was a race in S4?
[1:15:38] looney199725: but 1 person cannot make u jump from 2 to 1st its a team thing
[1:15:41] Stefan_x64: have they changed their philosophy on raid completion relying on DBM or do we still have that as a requirement for heroic or higher?
[1:15:47] looney199725: frag cannot carry 19 other ppl
[1:15:47] Meliea_EU: new bag is pretty too, bye bagnon

[1:15:57] iblighters: oh it's going to be
[1:16:15] Toiks: sofo?
[1:16:32] Korupcija_: sad, I want my guildmate to wipe entire raid :(
[1:16:33] majinavocado: @Toiks sepulcher of the first ones
[1:16:36] MindhackerTV: i hope they stop doing the raid and balancing it for the race.....
[1:16:37] Aquadriel: as a healer, i hate that. I like afking in raid sadge

[1:17:35] looney199725: broodmother is what people asked blizz to stop making
[1:17:59] Korupcija_: I prefer healers having to heal rather than to dps
[1:18:00] Stefan_x64: I just want normal pugs to be a viable option on EU alliance.. Here's hoping raid changes give us that
[1:18:01] Morfoick: @luq__e if it doesn't become part of subscription today, up to you if you want to buy it or wait 3 weeks for it to be free

[1:19:18] Stefan_x64: meanwhile Overwatch: No changes till December
[1:19:32] DarkRattz: should the raids wait and come out then in January?
[1:19:33] looney199725: people think its not gonna be a split run for few weeks
[1:19:36] DovahChicken: @ProverbX  i think blizz diabled the button for "mount drop chanse" LUL

[1:20:41] Korupcija_: that's good
[1:20:42] looney199725: that alone is gonna drag the race out
[1:20:42] Maego1: i would say they will go for like 3 per armor type and the rest is split bois

[1:21:55] Buckshater: What mount that you don't have is the one you want the most?  @Towelliee

[1:22:35] Stefan_x64: @Jynt334 damn, that's gotta be rough for people without guilds.. I'm gonna have to start looking for one again lol
[1:22:45] fubarMDK: @Towelliee "I am living in a world of darkness! Day man!"
[1:22:46] Kelticlore: ninja looters

[1:22:52] looney199725: oh 100% ppl gonna be toxic with it
[1:22:57] MXicanTroll: Were back to ninja group looters
[1:22:59] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  But did not he say you can only need on items that your class and spec can use?
[1:23:08] srze94: that sounds terrible
[1:23:13] Jynt334: @Stefan_x64 Guilds are gonna be a lot more important now unless you want to pug raids
[1:23:15] Toiks: oh boy Gold DKP runs will come back to retail :sadge
[1:23:16] looney199725: yano whats worse those 430 rings are only good for classes with fire spells but i bet everyone will need just for ilvl
[1:23:17] Yomoko: the loot systeme to come will be a nightmare for pu
[1:23:18] ProverbX: still cant need on stuff your spec can't use so im not sure about that
[1:23:19] pickle_niik: i thoguht if uve already looted the item you cant roll need

[1:23:20] Meliea_EU: i became so casual i dotn even raid anymore enough raiding done the first 10 years in wow
[1:23:23] ZangetsuVMG: no master looter?
[1:23:29] AlmullaTV: I dont sense any hype around this expansion, is it just me @Towelliee
[1:23:34] Skizzurp: i dont think it does for LFR
[1:23:35] Toiks: @Towelliee lfr has group loot they said so
[1:23:36] ilskarius: if they made it so that you cant need on items your class cant use i could be cool with it
[1:23:37] TweektheProphet: only premade groups
[1:23:42] Discodoktorn: is this 10.0? and does Elvui work?
[1:23:43] visaeris412: kinda surprised they didnt use personal loot for non guild raids
[1:23:45] ChrisarN: when are servers going down?
[1:23:48] ProverbX: @ilskarius it does work that way
[1:23:48] Kelticlore: omg dragonsoul lfr was a pain
[1:23:49] Jabbiz: yes it does, it was group loot on lfr beta test
[1:23:49] captain_khyzan: if i can use it or transmog it im needing it lol, this is what they wanted
[1:23:51] Megadisaster24: bro I never got my T10 4piece rogue set during ICC because it never freaking drop, not even the Champion Emblems, it sucked so bad
[1:23:51] fubarMDK: @Towelliee having to do Database patches at work I can tell you to solidly take the over on the server down time today if you are a betting man.
[1:23:53] cleanstrikes: Is Master Looter an option though or is Need/Greed forced on us? @Towelliee

[1:23:58] veetz21: Can only need on gear you can use
[1:23:58] looney199725: bro those very rare rings will change so much haha
[1:24:00] kryd3r: is it not for dungeons aswell?
[1:24:01] ZangetsuVMG: maybe they put a filter that if your class can't use it you can't roll on it then
[1:24:02] Deathraid82: Which is better for guilds
[1:24:03] tijaymn: The servers down already ?
[1:24:03] NonOffensive_: I am a new player , do I have to buy shadowlands and dragons flight? Or what?
[1:24:08] DreadgrimDK: as it should be

[1:24:15] Klarynse: Klarynse subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[1:24:21] jmalmin: That wouldnt work I think since you can not need or greed on armor that do not belong to your class.
[1:24:25] looney199725: if my vdh gets both those rare rings its GG
[1:24:26] Morfoick: @fubarMDK Shadowlands pre-patch got extended for an hour. I'm betting it'll be 2 hours for today.
[1:24:31] Deathraid82: lol!

[1:24:55] NonOffensive_: Hey I am a new player , do I have to buy shadowlands and dragons flight? Or what? anyone knows
[1:24:58] Stefan_x64: but if we roll need on a drop, we can't trade it with others in the group right? Only on greed rolls? Right? D:
[1:24:59] Meliea_EU: so why are you here if its "dead"
[1:25:00] Deathraid82: "And clarence parents have real nice marriage"
[1:25:00] fubarMDK: @Morfoick so 5pm PST? I'll still take the over probably
[1:25:12] ArcaneMaki: That 8 miles ref
[1:25:35] AlmullaTV: yeah i wondering why everyone has been so quiet
[1:25:36] ProverbX: Yea you can't need on items your spec isn't on the loot table for, they basically just changed the backend of personal loot rolling to a button you press
[1:25:37] Toiks: personally i m really hyped for expansion
[1:25:42] cappei: Hard to get hyped when the past 2 expansions have sucked massive dicks
[1:25:45] Megadisaster24: There have been more games, with FF, New World, Lost Ark, and other games, people just don't care about a Beta anymore
[1:25:48] chillmodez: I think that Blizz has been doing more internal testing instead of beta testing, at least i hope
[1:25:49] Kelticlore: i know blizz probably wont but i feel all the low pop and new player servers need to fully merge with the medium pop servers
[1:25:50] ProverbX: @Stefan_x64 they removed ALL trade restrictions
[1:25:55] Its_Ponti: Is pre-patch out yet for US?
[1:25:58] Meliea_EU: maybe after 18 yrs im conditioned but i still prefer wow over any other, LA is now dead too
[1:26:05] Ryntree: @towelliee  what's turned off with pre patch leeggos, cov abilities teir sets??
[1:26:05] Shrenko: @its_lorne no

[1:26:14] Featherbow: @its_lorne all day maintenance
[1:26:18] Its_Ponti: @Shrenko Thank you
[1:26:23] Its_Ponti: I see
[1:26:54] reggiepowa: I feel like there wasn't that much too stream. whenever raid testing or m+ weekends were a thing people were streaming

[1:46:22] WoW_StandalonE: people saying that new professions will be either the greatest thing ever or the downfall of the expansion
[1:46:23] The_Dane_Train: Im excited for DF, but also a little worried. First expansion with no end game grind AND no time commitment to level. I like WotLK leveling and retail end game. Wish that existed in a single version.
[1:46:23] jmalmin: Actually I am really good at leveling characters. I also now most classes in and out because of that. mobile gamer... A insult :D
[1:46:25] abracka_: you can still create the item, the other person provides the mats
[1:46:26] CraftyClaw: when do servers go down in us?
[1:46:39] zeeAbe: @Skizzurp The drops are BoP anyway, so they will craft the gear for OTHERS through work orders
[1:46:48] tyrantiron: the pre patch already came out?

[1:48:27] ashnmsr: @Towelliee wouldn't it be fun to add another layer of difficulty to the raid for high-end raiders that only rewards cosmetic-achievement?
[1:48:27] Dawnyan: very true @mavericks312
[1:48:31] 1SparrowTV: @Endofdreams agreeeeeeeeeeee
[1:48:33] jamarky23: @mavericks312  The ones that complain dont
[1:48:35] dwolters_the_zombieman: @91Niki are you going to make a drakthyr it's probably a silly question to ask
[1:48:36] belfastcl: people having time to take breaks and play other games might make the whole environment less toxic overall
[1:48:38] PvtHudson093: Would be nice for something to work towards like MoP's cloaks or WoD's rings
[1:48:39] Deathraid82: @stiffy84 morning!
[1:48:40] zgag: Thd is part of the 1 % of players.  If 99% of the players prefer the opposite of Thd DF will be a huge success

[1:49:34] N3llee: 100%
[1:49:35] BlinkHeals: mage tower begs to differ no? @Towelliee
[1:49:35] KillchainGames: as an absolute hardcore gw2 player from launch til path of fire. I completely end up falling out of gw2 because cosmetics dont do shit for you long term.
[1:49:36] DoughBoi_Trev: FF14 imo is a trash ass boring game. don't @ me
[1:49:39] Dawnyan: Glamour is the endgame for ffxiv
[1:49:39] DovahChicken: we aint weebs that like sparkels and unicorns
[1:49:40] Morfoick: Yet there's no borrowed power or systems in Dragonflight. RIP.
[1:49:43] Robodope: counter-argument: mage tower
[1:49:43] common_taco: Transmogs are the desert, I wany my main course gear

[1:50:04] DovahChicken: Me orc me want big Club me Smash with club
[1:50:05] Stinnkey: Ya just look at the RWF, no one cares about gettting the mount first, they care about what loot they got off the boss
[1:50:08] neverbornlucky: Give me my wow loot now or I will make you play ASHES of creation
[1:50:13] N3llee: must be one of them solo guys
[1:50:13] LolitaAldea: for that glam in wow must be better than it is right now
[1:50:17] jmalmin: Oh dont trash FF14 to much, I do not play the game, never could get into it. They got a big player base and their story is fantastic from what I understand.

[1:50:32] kappaday23: Kappa
[1:50:33] Bioxy12: Transmog is indeed a HUGE part of WoW but if raid dont drop loot but only transmog then F the raid
[1:50:36] LolitaAldea: sets are not very good imo
[1:50:37] SmygandeFizen: @Stinnkey Well they care about the loot cause they need it to progress for ranking xD
[1:50:41] KillchainGames: biggest side horizontal progression sure but it cant be the ONLY progression you need both horizontal and vertical prog
[1:50:43] ashnmsr: I mean wouldn't you want it though towel? as a bonus thing you could do or just not do
[1:50:45] ZakuzaGB: i would say transmog alone is a big part of wow rather that collections are
[1:50:49] Morfoick: @jmalmin yeah if you like the old FF JRPGs and the story, xiv is has huge amounts of story lik ethat
[1:50:55] Reap14: @AnotherCheche You are the one talking shit about an entire community of players so you may want to look into the mirror.
[1:50:57] firehawk73: Archeology is the biggest part of WoW
[1:50:57] DovahChicken: @Endofdreams  the game is optimized to hell.. and i aint downloading mods and filters to make it better
[1:51:01] ashnmsr: No no not mythic!
[1:51:03] SmygandeFizen: Omegalul xD
[1:51:04] sliproach: @zgag pet battles> all
[1:51:05] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: To play devil's advocate, if transmog/cosmetics weren't that important to high end players, people wouldn't have been upset at the SoM Naxx Undying achievement being just a TGC tabard
[1:51:06] looney199725: id quit
[1:51:07] Stinnkey: @SmygandeFizen I literally just said RWF lmao, they already achieved the ranking at that point xD
[1:51:07] Stiffy84: Are we getting anything to do in pre-patch today?
[1:51:08] ashnmsr: i mean another difficulty
[1:51:08] Dreamerstream: What time is the prepatch release?
[1:51:08] Skizzurp: game would be dead
[1:51:09] jamarky23: why not get both?
[1:51:09] N3llee: raiding scene would die
[1:51:12] mavericks312: if you told liquid and echo all there getting is T-mog RwF is dead lol
[1:51:14] Snabido: Everyone gets scaled to an ilvl in instances and pvp KEKW

[1:51:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: heroics back on the menu
[1:51:17] reggiepowa: I am definitely loot driven, if the best loot wasn't behind hardest content I would have no desire of doing it
[1:51:18] AnotherCheche: @Reap14 i have over a thousand hours in ffxiv and yes the community in that game is horrendous
[1:51:19] Kurco_: WoW is collectionism nowdays
[1:51:20] WoW_StandalonE: not mythic, above mythic difficulty
[1:51:20] Todmeister9000: unsub
[1:51:20] Dudutoolbox: progression is the main wow drive lol
[1:51:23] wernerdhs: write that down, write that down
[1:51:27] raye_gaming22: this would save us split runs im all for it not gonna lie lol
[1:51:27] Technogre: why can't the gear be powerful and look good
[1:51:30] Kakotan2143: Dude Transmog is a BIG part of WOW but not enough to get people hyped for it as the only reward, anyone who says it is, is delusional
[1:51:32] Reap14: @AnotherCheche You are stunningly full of shit.
[1:51:33] JFeezy__: I'm 100% gear driven that's half the fun of all the shitter games lol.... I am 1 billion percent against garbage borrowed powers lol
[1:51:34] PastelByeol: Exactly XD
[1:51:35] reggiepowa: exactly
[1:51:35] ZakuzaGB: that sounds like the PoV of someone that doesnt raid mythic lol
[1:51:36] Ariea_Whisper: Game would die if raids were like that imo
[1:51:36] szble: yeah thats mythic when they arent lazy with tier sets
[1:51:37] Shrandamar: I would quit if it didnt drop loot
[1:51:40] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:51:40] Windjam72: I want TMOGS!!!
[1:51:41] 91Niki: "BUT I WANT MORE TRANSMOG DAMNIT BabyRage "

[1:51:56] adamh_1987: well....
[1:51:57] DoughBoi_Trev: gotta love clearing a Savage raid in 6 hours vs Mythic raiding taking 1 to 2 weeks to clear... WoW = Superior
[1:51:58] Greneer: mythic tmog
[1:51:58] BROKENARROVV: the system yes, the transmog itself sadly no
[1:52:04] Kinghorn: LFR LFR+ normal abnormal heroic mythic extreme mythic extreme
[1:52:04] brozzy: Was there a full moon last night? Who are these weirdos that don’t want loot for doing hard content
[1:52:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: I want pictures of SPIDERMAN
[1:52:10] Reap14: @AnotherCheche You didn't do anything. You are just talking trash.
[1:52:11] Stinnkey: And ontop of that youre asking blizzard to balance all classes and specs around ANOTHER level of content....thats insanity
[1:52:13] TheCheeseWheel87: Dyes would be nice to have thought
[1:52:15] jamarky23: thats subjective
[1:52:18] Windjam72: what are we talking about??  oh yeah, TRANSMOGS!
[1:52:18] BlinkHeals: I mean you can always compare them
[1:52:19] szble: man yeah that was a cope
[1:52:19] ancester: I like to collect mounts and I'm pissed of the huge amount of mounts that was baked into SL... gonna suck to go back to farm those on those zones
[1:52:19] AnotherCheche: @Reap14 okay LOL
[1:52:21] mavericks312: FF is also a console game so its kinda unfair
[1:52:23] belfastcl: people keep saying ff14 looks better than other mmos, I just don't see it
[1:52:26] firehawk73: But, i'm entitled...i deserve MORE @Towelliee
[1:52:28] DoughBoi_Trev: FINAL FANTASY ALSO NOT A TRUE OPEN WORLD MMORPG
[1:52:30] Hexadecimal88: Nah, Dyes ruined Ultima Online....

[1:52:36] JFeezy__: mythic lfr when? Kappa
[1:52:37] Dudutoolbox: if they remove gear progression from wow 90% of players would quit
[1:52:37] neverbornlucky: you just mad bro that WOW doesn't have Bunny girls in it
[1:52:41] CraftyClaw: @PvtHudson093 It will not age as well as the stylised art style of wow
[1:52:42] dyslexican1: That we should all be scaled and just get cosmetics. like wtf.
[1:52:42] looney199725: to me ff14 looks like shit im not into that anime weeb shit
[1:52:43] DoughBoi_Trev: load screens in-between zones, and zone barriers
[1:52:43] Herzenliegen: The current gear in wow is ugly. They don't put in as much thought to as FF
[1:52:50] Morfoick: The only complaint I have with FFXIV is the awful 2.5s GCD. If they went to 1.5s like WoW, the combat would be much better in XIV.
[1:52:52] ProverbX: wow looks better than ff imo
[1:52:58] Kakotan2143: Yeah the WoW Transmog system is way better then FF14 and ESO and I played all 3 games

[1:53:09] Windjam72: got what?!?  I was AFKK!!!

[1:53:25] odizs_: odizs_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[1:53:26] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I personally prefer WoW's graphics when you turn everything to max/rtx on. It's far more atmospheric for my tastes
[1:53:30] jamarky23: Why are we arguing about a subjective thing in chat LUL
[1:53:32] duffluv22: WoW caters to a broader base because not everyone has 3090 graphic cards.
[1:53:35] Mecabeast: legion tier was peak design for looks imo
[1:53:38] szble: please no LUL
[1:53:41] AnotherCheche: female gnolls Kreygasm

[1:55:02] Kakotan2143: @Kakotan2143 yeah we do lol
[1:55:03] TheCakeBadger: ogres are the cutest
[1:55:15] Juanzary: brew nerfed
[1:55:17] zeeAbe: @Korupcija_ You cannot turn fated off. So for the next 3 weeks every raid is fated
[1:55:20] Narktali: xD
[1:55:31] Windjam72: is WOW down??  well crap I'm uninstalling!!!
[1:55:32] jmalmin: 8 hours+ downtime...
[1:55:33] PrimalRain: I'd imagine late this evening
[1:55:33] Herzenliegen: There's really nothing to do in Wow until November 15, even then there isn't much.
[1:55:36] agnarz: cant be worse than original wotlk prepatch D:
[1:55:39] Morfoick: Shadowlands was only extended by an hour, so fingers crossed.
[1:55:40] Honvar: The only thing I need is archeology and I will be happy @Towelliee
[1:55:40] dwolters_the_zombieman: ogres are funny when they dance
[1:55:44] ShadoodHD: i bet prepatch will get delayed just like how we were suppose to test it in PTR Kappa
[1:55:45] Korupcija_: @zeeAbe I know, but maybe he knows if they are willing to change that
[1:55:52] headshot_hunter6: everyones getting excited for pre-patch today.... but i heard that pre patch was the 26th
[1:55:58] GiveLoveLive: What gaming mouses are good right now?

[1:55:59] Windjam72: owait I'm playing Lich King classic...I'm installing again
[1:56:01] Buckshater: @Towelliee do you think the pre-patch talents will wipe my entire action bars like most pre-expansion stuff?
[1:56:07] N3llee: Interesting video Preach posted lastnight on twitter eh?
[1:56:11] Morfoick: @headshot_hunter6 in EU it is
[1:56:12] duffluv22: Damn....Thanksgiving is next month!!!!
[1:56:19] ashnmsr: @Towelliee now i know why blizzard made pre-patch 2 parts because you said you gonna be away for the first 2-3 weeks! you did this :D
[1:56:22] PadidinJones: @Buckshater Not entirely!
[1:56:29] TheCakeBadger: @windjam72 the suspense. You really gad me worried there!
[1:56:32] zeeAbe: @Korupcija_ there is absolutely zero reason to put in the work to change that when it will be irrelevant in 5 weeks
[1:56:35] TheCakeBadger: had*
[1:56:38] ZakuzaGB: i would reccommend corsair scimitar its a good one for mmo gaming
[1:56:43] Dudutoolbox: they never ever released a race in prepatch always in xpac release so theres no reason to complain they arent releasing dracthir on the 25th
[1:56:44] PastelByeol: Razer Viper ult is pretty good ^^
[1:56:45] dwolters_the_zombieman: not too long when this year is over

[1:57:18] szble: just get the logitech one
[1:57:21] PrimalRain: shit will probably break in a year

[1:57:22] sircheex: i found a knock off naga for 30 bucks that's wireless and is fantastic
[1:57:23] agnarz: how many slams can that mouse take
[1:57:29] Windjam72: Hunter Shaman mouse for sure
[1:57:31] TheCakeBadger: Razer mice break too easy. They are not as durable as they once was a decade ago.
[1:57:31] N3llee: Interesting video Preach posted lastnight on twitter eh? @Towelliee

[1:57:55] Uifi: omh I got my naga since 2013
[1:58:04] The_Dane_Train: I like the Logitech G502. It’s got more buttons than a normal mouse, but not quite as many as mmo mouse.
[1:58:05] EclipserEU: have redragon M901 and its great
[1:58:08] theDirtyon3: @TheCakeBadger i have had a trinity for 4 years already im not quite sure what you are talking about
[1:58:09] s7wede: that would fuck up my muscle memory so bad
[1:58:10] Honvar: @rippazz I think I have the same
[1:58:12] WoW_StandalonE: that's a keyboard already lol
[1:58:14] Noshpan: I actually have that Redragon mouse LUL
[1:58:20] Lupusdeus: Scimitar is the one
[1:58:22] dwolters_the_zombieman: my razer is cheaply made
[1:58:28] Karbonn: This entire Holiday Season is going to be MMO's and CoD. Oh man what a time.
[1:58:34] Stefan_x64: i will say that my main issue with mouses (mice?) is that they start registering double clicks after a year or two... This is mainly due to the fact that they overvolt the board on purpose during design/R&D
[1:58:37] ZeusDNA: I'm waiting until they release the mouse expansion and it's foot pedal with buttons for each toe
[1:58:40] Noshpan: Yeah, it's been a nice budget mouse

[1:58:52] dirtydeus: Are you playing prot pally still even with all its issues?
[1:58:52] dwolters_the_zombieman: yes
[1:58:56] crumbler81: I used to have a cheap wireless mmo mouse but got tired of the wrong buttons triggering LUL - switched to corsair and logitech
[1:58:58] Sollice: I didn't buy any but Red Dragon has a great budget line of custom keyboards, switches etc all that kind of stuff for beginning keyboard builders
[1:59:04] AnotherCheche: bro my scimitar breaks once a year so i have to buy a new one
[1:59:14] Uifi: have you try the corsair one?
[1:59:16] ZakuzaGB: i dont dislike razor, but i gone through a ton of those its always the side buttons that fail
[1:59:18] Sollice: god damn lint
[1:59:18] ShadoodHD: i fucked up my mouse wheel and i dont have a 3d printer to replace it (corsair) FeelsBadMan
[1:59:20] MR_WYTE: Anyone try the new Steelseries MMO mouse? It looks pretty slick. I may give it a try once current mouse dies./
[1:59:26] s7wede: The hardest part about opening the naga pro is finding the damn screwdriver to fit the bit
[1:59:30] enux337: logitech g600 is good
[1:59:34] N3llee: same xp with razor
[1:59:34] Lupusdeus: I went through the same with Nagas
[1:59:34] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i just bought myself a logitech g600 plugged it in now i'm trying to muscle memory the keybinds now lol
[1:59:36] TheCakeBadger: @thedirtyon3 you are lucky then. There quality control has gone way downhill as I am sure you can find plenty of feedback on the interwebs. I had 2 successive Nagas fail on me. Did some reading and noticed I am far from the only one.
[1:59:37] Khartax: my naga broke a lot then got a g600 also have a problem with number 3 usually
[1:59:37] Deathraid82: @Towelliee I had three naga's i had to trash because the right click stopped working. I've had the scimitar longer than my last naga
[1:59:38] AnotherCheche: its just the naga looks so ugly tho LOL
[1:59:40] MR_WYTE: AEROX 9 WIRELESS

[1:59:49] Stefan_x64: mine lasted 2 years LUL thinking about getting an mmo naga next.. Currently have the new logitech G502 X
[1:59:53] Verdell263: I have the Logitech MMP mouse, it's decent enough, but their software leaves a lot to be desired
[1:59:55] budding121: See for me its the otherway around, Razer mouses always break on me while crossair always done me right
[1:59:56] Verdell263: *MMO
[1:59:58] HoboFighter2: Should try the SteelSeries Aerox 9
[1:59:58] crumbler81: dang I have refurbished corsair, been good for 3 or 4 years so far
[2:00:01] TheCakeBadger: @deathraid82 same
[2:00:02] dwolters_the_zombieman: it can't charge right or the Bluetooth is crappy
[2:00:03] ArcaneMaki: lg 600 ftw

[2:00:31] abracka_: the logitech mmo mouse is pretty sturdy, i've had mine for close to two years without any issues
[2:00:33] MindhackerTV: my naga last  4 years and i play everyday... just replace the microswitch for a decent one and GG

[2:01:11] szble: huntsman is p good

[2:02:13] ZakuzaGB: the best patch i ever had was the mechagon and nazjatar patch by far
[2:02:16] Nethil: @HaxzorJimDuggan Ye I hope so
[2:02:17] odawgxd: They replace systems with Mythic + and PVP. Dont need anything else.

[2:02:32] Funderik: its either systems of no system there is not middle ground
[2:02:37] TheCakeBadger: @honvar Its not easy. Good for you. :)
[2:02:40] MindhackerTV: or... you can just remove all the systems and raidlog like it was xD love those days
[2:02:42] veetz21: And they are never account wide
[2:02:42] Morfoick: Yup. If 9.2.5 was base expansion, Shadowlands would've bene perfect
[2:02:44] ShadoodHD: either that or we suck at asking what we want for christmas
[2:02:45] kalamari__: they simply went to to hard on systems. they just should keep one system in with a grind. not having 3-4 systems
[2:02:49] FreeguyDH: They may be better with new talent system as a base.
[2:02:50] dwolters_the_zombieman: my mouse isn't a year old and the charging is awful and bluetooth connection is awful
[2:03:05] ZakuzaGB: the thing is we must go round in circles with this stuff and they still dont get it so the game might be fun for a while with no systems haha
[2:03:06] The_Dane_Train: Systems replaced long leveling process. Now short leveling and no end game grind.
[2:03:08] moa285: I heard the word success and Shadowlands in the same sentence... what did you say? Kappa
[2:03:16] coldhandsbeatz: Mythic+ is a system. It was a success. So was Mage Tower. Those are the kind of systems that they need to develop

[2:03:42] Todmeister9000: so what do we grind in DF?
[2:03:42] Cosmolus: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:03:52] ZakuzaGB: as someone who enjoys playing alts DF is looking fckin awesome
[2:03:52] frostzebra: what made me quit retail is the soft-requirement to do M+ if you wanna raid
[2:03:53] dwolters_the_zombieman: coming soon DF classic
[2:03:58] coldhandsbeatz: I think they will add on top of base DF during the expac. Cool patch things like Mage Tower I would say
[2:03:58] looney199725: @JarrJarrBB gear
[2:04:00] DigitalChill: towSip
[2:04:01] Honvar: @TheCakeBadger It sure is not. But I'm feeling so much better now. The only thing that suck is that I had a cortisone injection in my knee due overpressure (or how do you say that in English)
[2:04:09] goosejamss: @coldhandsbeatz M+ is not a system.  it is a difficulty modifier
[2:04:11] Morfoick: @Towelliee If they release systems/borrowed power in later Dragonflight x.1, x.2, etc. What do you think it would be?
[2:04:16] Lupusdeus: the new professions are a system no?
[2:04:16] Zapetoni: I miss artefact weapons PepeHands

[2:13:45] Jessarin: ok, you got a point. that does seem less obtrusive
[2:13:45] smokingcactus: imagine doing a raid boss and all your viewers see is ads all over the raid
[2:13:46] Velashen: it would be both
[2:13:46] dranet11: rather just turn the stream off
[2:13:47] MR_WYTE: But it's going to be 3-10 mins of commercials AND this in-game garbage and we all know it.
[2:13:49] Kon_Soul: i pay for turbo so i don't care about ads on twitch but keep them OUT of my damn gamed

[2:13:58] raldrik: Wait until you are watching RWF and the ground swirls are all Pepsi logos.
[2:14:01] EpicJune: but we know it won't stop at just a wall KEKW
[2:14:04] Clicklesly: Anarchy Online did have literal billboards in the game iirc

[2:14:06] Trasheye: Soon we will have ads printed into our brains
[2:14:06] s7wede: I don't know why adverts don't display the stream as PiP so that you don't miss important content.
[2:14:06] Panadol324: i have add block to block this shiet comercials
[2:14:07] Vecin: you say that like they won't still do the regular ads as well

[2:14:08] enux337: anyone remember free games with in game ads?

[2:14:47] abracka_: KONY 2012
[2:14:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: the doc should buy adspace for his streams with his face plastered over the walls of eternum LUL
[2:14:48] AvrithSATX: Yeah, no doubt. This won't stop streaming ads by any stretch of the imagination.
[2:14:51] dwolters_the_zombieman: lol

[2:16:40] EpicJune: if kept subtle, then i'm fine, but i can see them going over the top with it
[2:16:43] dyslexican1: @fractaleyes bro, you are not supporting the streamer you are watching, there is also a way to avoid adds on the whole site. if you want to cry because adds support the streamer who is ENTERTAINING you and you want to cry cus you have to watch adds then you are entitled af.
[2:16:46] gfield2k: Good morning @towelliee jusrelSalute

[2:42:36] zgag: For those w/o beta it will probably be something to do. Those with beta will probably find it boring
[2:42:39] s7wede: I reckon the first drop is going to be a transmog set similar to the primalist invasion gear and the 2nd is going to be a mount.

[2:52:33] Roobi_doobi: hey towellie! been awhile, what are your thoughts on evoker?

[2:52:36] MarquisLek: press the plus icon
[2:52:38] Ertra: you've gotta log into the other characters
[2:52:39] conquestandvictory: As a person who plays WoW at a high level i can say both BFA and SL were not bad as people say. Actually appreciating the game for being strategic on high keys and CE and high end PVP is a different point of view which most people dont have.
[2:52:40] peinen: @BoatLoadsofDope Good. How'd that hype work out for BfA & SL?
[2:52:41] bankier9999: @Towelliee saved instances has it too
