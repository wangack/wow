[2:09:29] EfnetLemons: anyone have video link for the liquid tindral kill
[2:09:46] AlphasaurusRexx: @yodacarter getting rid of consecrate would be sick on prot
[2:10:48] ArcaneSyntax: Yeah I think tying defensiveness to consecrate is just bad design
[2:11:01] cyrex172: i remember holy pallys a few months ago being top tier healing
[2:11:36] AlphasaurusRexx: with how much movement is in all boss fights and trash fights, having a put-in-place ability is bad design nowadays
[2:11:44] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think you could ever get rid of consecrate, but making it a passive effect not tied to a DR would make the spec play better.
[2:12:30] AlphasaurusRexx: consecrate, DnD, monk totem all feel like shit to play

[2:35:22] mavericks312: there gonna stream the first couple phases atleast
[2:35:30] denith969: but its also thanksgiving tomorrow if fryakk isn't dead >.<
[2:35:38] AlphasaurusRexx: @Towelliee real talk. would you rather they nerf the top performing 2-3 specs or bring everyone else up to their level? is shit too easy if everything gets buffed?
[2:35:47] ArcaneSyntax: I'm not sure Liquid streams if echo doesn't beat Tindral.
[2:35:49] HaggardxGaming: Hey Towelliee, long time lurker here. As someone who has very little exp doing Mythic runs, is it normal for people to get easily pissed off and leave groups if multiple wipes happen? Is no one like ok with helping people learn these dungeons? This is coming from a player who started in Shadowlands and has no exp with older dungeons.
[2:36:04] Niksen_99: 80% of Liquid is EU players they dont care
[2:36:09] mavericks312: personally if im liquid im not streaming any fyrakk attempts today
[2:36:10] ZeusDNA: I mean, I'll be watching tomorrow for sure lmao
[2:36:21] smashwow: what's kinda fucked up is that the devs said we don't want to do that anymore but yet here we are again...
[2:36:27] KingPeakin: i was away for a question i asked early about playing with high ping which class u recommend @Towelliee
[2:36:29] PhantomYona93: ive been watching this race since day 1 and i dont care its turkey day tomorrow. just feels like another day to me
[2:36:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: im sure someone is making a turkey for them tomorrow anyway
[2:36:48] yadungoofed101: NA players only one that Thanksgiving affects anyway

[2:37:23] ZeusDNA: I could be mistaken though. I think they got their Thursday night.
[2:37:24] breadwilton: @mavericks312 ill have the stream up XD
[2:37:24] the_spectrax: @HaggardxGaming unfortunately it is normal. ppl in mmos are toxic. but the least you can do before going m+ is to watch yt guide and tell ppl its your first run. also try every dung on some lower keys +5 max for instance
[2:37:25] grimdark_dork: something with a pet for high ping
[2:37:28] breadwilton: I dont give a fuck what my family thinks
[2:37:34] AlphasaurusRexx: inky black potion makes this fight look so damn good
[2:37:42] mavericks312: aint no one watching RWF with family and football
[2:37:47] JoshuaTree6969: not if you work in a field that doesn’t stop bc it’s a holiday…
[2:37:52] Clicklesly: @KingPeakin Try BM Hunter ^^
[2:37:56] ArcaneSyntax: People watch football on Thanksgiving, I'm watching esports
[2:38:25] AlphasaurusRexx: @JoshuaTree6969 just dont go to work
[2:38:25] breadwilton: @KingPeakin Any class that doesnt use cast times is good
[2:38:53] Thoreya: wonder when the liquid boys start
[2:38:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: bring on the delves
[2:39:06] runningbulls: Only tier I care about is my 4 set
[2:39:13] ArcaneSyntax: Fuckin tanks doing mdi pulls in a 12, like bro I'm 450 ilvl
[2:39:15] breadwilton: hunters have enough of a bad reputation
[2:39:19] breadwilton: ppl like that need to stop lol
[2:39:26] Dopplebok: I saw ppl in chat discouraging somebody from playing prot war bc "it's F tier"
[2:39:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: good enough for me because i refuse to pug m+ at all
[2:39:53] breadwilton: @Dopplebok Unfortunately meta is what determines if you get into a group or not
[2:40:01] grimdark_dork: I'm fine with that difficulty at this point in my life
[2:40:01] KingPeakin: @Stompsville leanding towards hutner
[2:40:10] Nerzalus: only play S tier
[2:40:18] papaherc: this raid is firelands 2.0
[2:40:26] breadwilton: Ppl meme about meta, but it 100% determines if you get into a group or not. Streamers dont understand because they have a flock of a thousand ppl willing to do w/e they want

[2:40:55] Dopplebok: @Stompsville For sure. I don't M+ but thought the convo was absurd.
[2:40:55] the_spectrax: @Stompsville ye i remmber last season. so much ppl decline me on my hunter. but when i get in i was first in dps, fucking prejudices
[2:41:03] TweektheProphet: Oh Max
[2:41:27] tylerwithghosts: Topping the charts as Ret currently, 2k IO, 460 ilvl, can't get into 11s with randoms lmao meta gaming is super lame
[2:41:29] breadwilton: @Stompsville yep i quit playing hunter because i could only do 1 or 2 dungeons a day because i would spend my whole play time trying to find a group
[2:41:32] KingPeakin: i played Survival hunter back in AU everyone telling me its C class and i was 98 parsing pulling 30 k more DPS then other people in M+ and Raiding
[2:41:34] AlphasaurusRexx: ill play WW till the day the spec gets yeeted from the game
[2:41:34] JoshuaTree6969: meta is garbage
[2:41:48] Molvonos: The only time the meta doesnt function is if you have a full, stable group.
[2:41:58] KingPeakin: i did get kicked out M+ groups as survival
[2:42:04] breadwilton: @KingPeakin parsing is only against others of your same spec
[2:42:08] the_spectrax: @Towelliee ye fucking meta sheeps..
[2:42:10] bekindtoeachothr: WoW doesnt really have much room to not be meta
[2:42:11] kiroslays: not me man people have to deal with my garbage …. learn as I go no add one
[2:42:12] ArcaneSyntax: People bitched about ret paladin at the start of the season and it's probably the most played melee DPS right now
[2:42:13] drunkieduckie: that's why i've been casual and don't care about top tier/meta crap.
[2:42:16] runningbulls: I was thinking of leveling my warrior tank for the set

[2:45:18] smashwow: how as a tank can you do too much threat?
[2:45:22] AlphasaurusRexx: liquid had like 3 double soak wipes at 4% before they killed it. its easily dead with echo if they can clean up the last few mechanics

[2:52:13] smashwow: @ArcaneSyntax not really they got like 5 to 7 hrs left. not really the end of their day. it's the last half of their day for sure. they should kill sageswift about the same way limit did. just before they go to bed. but sageswift could die any pull that is clean.

[3:18:59] mavericks312: @rosina_scarlett right but if echo keeps struggling and liquid pulls fyrakk an see it more it heavily favors liquid
[3:19:08] mavericks312: pull counts dont matter
[3:19:19] rosina_scarlett: @mavericks312 Yeah it 100% will
[3:20:13] rosina_scarlett: i know Echo switched up their comp they had 2x Fury now they have an enhance
[3:20:13] mavericks312: do you thnk echo is trying to hard right now and thats casuings mishaps?
[3:20:40] Arbszy: Fyrakk could be Xavius
[3:20:54] loragheta: @Arbszy ain't no way
[3:20:59] mavericks312: if fyrakk is xavius that would be wild
[3:21:05] Cojoha: all about that execution
[3:21:23] rosina_scarlett: Echo is at where Liquid was. in any pull is a kill territory
[3:21:39] mavericks312: tbh echo on tindral looks like echo on sark last tier atm
[3:21:46] mythic_tavern: What mic is that @towelliee
[3:21:52] Niksen_99: Echo def look strongest this raid
[3:22:12] mythic_tavern: Is it sn XLR or USB?

[3:47:12] TurtleThumbWar: Does it opened atomatically if someone makes it or do they have to actually open it for you?
[3:47:24] Bowwjack: @Towelliee a fucking nightmare

[3:48:38] TurtleThumbWar: nice, that means the turds I was playing with just started fighting instead of channeling it open lmao
[3:49:20] nohablo: Just did this on 15 and it was a nightmare LMAO

[4:02:18] Onearmyof2: you guys want to keep the boss from cleaving the adds or he gets stacks

[4:56:56] cazhually: liquid already crushed it 75%
[4:57:03] cazhually: echo taking a long time?
[4:58:32] nevercluckyy: i think liquid reacted more to killing t swift then they did with sarkareth
[4:58:38] mavericks312: echo has to kill tindral first
[4:58:59] cazhually: are echo really not going to kill it
[4:59:13] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Plot twist; BDG is going to come in hot and take the whole thing Kappa
[4:59:15] Shagathal: Echo is up for dinner not bed yet ;)
[4:59:23] castlecastles: echo = mid now
[4:59:28] mavericks312: its going on what 8pm for echo now
[4:59:39] LeXieSterling: Do these teams rotate team members. So they can go 24/7 till they are done?
[4:59:45] cazhually: if liquid kills fryakk before echo. probably top world first moment
[4:59:55] Niksen_99: They are just on EU servers lol
[5:00:10] Shagathal: Goal was to have him down before dinner so that might throw a wrench in their plans

[5:02:02] vaironixx: liquid less so as an org though, they are in multiple games
[5:02:06] nevercluckyy: i really thought scripe and meeres were done last tier
[5:02:07] LegoCoin: cjayLift
[5:02:51] Lintgamer: But scripe and roger are CEO of echo
[5:02:53] Paponoh: Its gonna be echos war within KEKW
[5:02:57] cazhually: if meeree leaves they’re done for
[5:02:59] mavericks312: if scripes and roger were to leave echo would have to do some soul searching
[5:03:04] Lintgamer: so they just find someone to replace raidcalling no?

[5:04:44] QueenAwakened: i have a question, what ilvl do i need to be to do premade normal raids
[5:04:46] 3663Sharad: It would be Method all over again
[5:04:55] nevercluckyy: i feel like if scripe/meeres were to quit alot of echo would go back to method and juice them back up
[5:04:56] 3663Sharad: jsut with Liquid
[5:04:58] mannymays: winning doesn't matter if you go broke
[5:05:01] Zettabyte: It's like RTWF done quick if that happens KEKW
[5:05:05] Phoxzy: If echo disbands and Liquid runs away with it every time, the hype and viewership would die for the RWF and then noone would watch.
[5:05:23] Breeklichtje: @Towelliee may i ask what kinda gamechair you have. i need a new one

[5:07:29] Sollice: @ArcaneSyntax Yes I am sure they want to "lose"
[5:07:34] Phil87z: would losing two races in a row really cause then tk disband? liquid lost two in a row
[5:07:36] MackPlays: Hammer Squad will win on year
[5:07:45] ArcaneSyntax: @ArcaneSyntax exactly
[5:07:47] designthisx: was that a Dave chappel reference
[5:08:01] cazhually: but the sweet sweet eu tears for a whole year if liquid win is always worth
[5:08:03] designthisx: darkness?
[5:08:10] cazhually: am I right or am I right!
[5:08:15] mavericks312: idk disbanning after losing 2 races is kinda weak though
