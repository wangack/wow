His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[4:53:49] ditchdigger456: Cdank is an actual agent, I swear to God. I've seen him not only get himself killed but also many others in groups and raids. His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[7:24:22] Carthredge: ABOBA The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.
