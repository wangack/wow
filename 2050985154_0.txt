[1:33:58] TyndiVelspaz: Imagine Legion Classic! and then Shadowlands Classic!!!
[1:34:03] oradros: if they fix Mop daily quest issues it will be good
[1:34:08] Aggy: I was so burnt out, I was in a hardcode guild and prog was soul sucking
[1:34:19] Daemoos6: ^

[1:40:10] GrimGoreRMW: i like right one
[1:40:13] Fafnyir: the border on the right is what throws me off.
[1:40:16] Voidthos: Make the bottom transparent with the current color temp and it'll look better
[1:40:17] DrBrumm: keft one is burning :D right one is nice
[1:40:18] nephandis: I prefer the green text on black over black text on green

[1:40:39] Daemoos6: Bottom border is fine, but not at the top
[1:41:00] Daemoos6: kinda use the left border, but not the full green background at the bottot
[1:41:52] Daemoos6: border is fine on that scene
