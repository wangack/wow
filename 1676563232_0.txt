[3:46:49] jaybandz303: Developers’ notes: With the new talent trees, Demon Hunter Sigils have become stronger than we’d like in PvP, specifically the duration Sigil of Misery, so we are targeting talents that were contributing to that. Additionally, Demon Hunters’ damage in PvP is higher than we have been comfortable with so we are reducing the damage from Essence Break, in addition to last week’s reduction for The Hunt.  Sigil of Misery PvP duration reduced to 4 seconds (was 5 seconds). Concentrated Sigils duratio
[3:47:04] jaybandz303: The Hunt now heals for 10%/20% (as Havoc/Vengeance) of damage dealt to the marked target for 20 sec (was 25%/50% for 30 seconds). Charred Warblades now heals for 3% of Fire damage dealt (was 5%). Fixed an issue that unintentionally permitted Fodder to the Flame’s heal effect to crit. Havoc Essence Break damage reduced by 8%.
