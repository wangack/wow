[1:26:50] KCYON: there are a couple streamers that seem to have other endeavours built by the popularity of their stream
[1:26:50] zichclassic: @coolcrazyguy72 It will never stop, if blizz doesnt provide wow to the people private servers will just get big again
[1:26:51] IR_ish: teachers are always needed, in anything
[1:26:53] bone555: Have you seen the new RTS from Frost Giant studios

[1:28:30] clozer_kek: SStv = Salty Cracker 2.0

[1:28:40] Doribob1: ssttvPls
[1:28:41] Titty_Boyz: how much to buy his patent?
[1:28:42] Rosindogg: can I apply to be the one to put the cum in the gum
[1:28:46] IR_ish: what's that about did they stop producing all together now?
[1:28:47] troutmaster23: personally chewed by Mr safe
[1:28:47] erawin1990: what are you up to staysafe?
[1:28:53] KCYON: logistics blows my mind
[1:29:02] heylowdub: every business depends on other businesses and demand from customers. I am a home inspector and having to depend on the real estate market doing well is nerve racking at times
[1:29:10] KCYON: like who organizes aliexpress' shipments
[1:29:30] Moadeeb: is this the test realm?
[1:29:42] IR_ish: aliexpress is like ebay, the seller organizes the shipment @KCYON
[1:29:45] CollinPCO: if you build they will come
[1:29:46] Moadeeb: can you get all those waylaid right now?
[1:29:47] Doribob1: what did i miss about the gum?

[1:29:58] MrWafer29: @Moadeeb yes hes farming experience items on a test realm
[1:30:09] KCYON: @IR_ish i'm moreso talking about the person who organizes the ship that moves country to country, then to a delivery service, etc
[1:30:10] IR_ish: aliexpress is an intermediary
[1:30:12] Moadeeb: so you just fill them?
[1:30:17] Moadeeb: and u can have unlimited?
[1:30:24] KCYON: or rather makes the design schema for that
[1:30:28] larnsmarf: i watched gerber run into this with glass jars
[1:31:01] Titty_Boyz: so is there a monopoly on gum production? or just naturally not that many people willling?
[1:31:09] jonv0: maybe thats okay? for a more stable manufactuerer?
[1:31:19] ThoR294: Like a tire manufacturer changing their rubber supplier
[1:31:21] heylowdub: i see
[1:31:26] KCYON: the next step then would be to fund a testing phase if you cant work with the same manufacturer
[1:31:26] ThoR294: Changes the core of the product
[1:31:27] Plathyy: hopefully itll be better
[1:31:29] IR_ish: how would it taste different, if they are the same ingredients?
[1:31:30] Doribob1: what did i miss about the gum? 󠀀

[1:31:40] tampaESPORTS: sstvKING
[1:31:43] Dreadnought628: what is the problem with this supplier? just not operating? supply chain issues?
[1:31:52] ThoR294: Wait you don't make powergum in your garage with beakers and a pot? Unbelievable!
[1:31:53] chattybadger: it sounds like your manufacturer offers a very specific product. what if you looked into several companies that offer the same high quality product that you could depend on. kind of like how most pizza chains use bonta pizza sauce, and are not beholden to one manufacterer to supply it
[1:32:12] erawin1990: babysitting?
[1:32:13] KCYON: physical products are tough dude, gg's for getting to this point
[1:32:47] BigChoobs: whats your thoughts on usury, based or cringe?
[1:32:48] Doribob1: what did i miss about the gum?
[1:32:55] KCYON: there are also companies that make it their business to be replacements
[1:32:58] tampaESPORTS: it's like when i used to drink Monster Rehab and they changed the formula and i never drank it again
[1:33:01] KCYON: lool
[1:33:28] hxyfever: @tampaESPORTS did they call it monster relapse
[1:33:41] troutmaster23: any chance someone else can do it better?
[1:33:49] soupxhot: did you see the video of UFC fighter Renato Moicano? he's pretty based

I have the freedom to have my animals eat grass wherever if, say, one particular land owner I lease from upsets me in some way or dies or sells the land or w/e.

[1:38:19] Greedygoose: America IS at war with russia. we've been at war with them since the korean war
[1:38:21] NooleanB: Well, they did put a Russian asset in the presidency, then use him to extract national secrets

[2:04:44] LockheartEXE: if russia could take alaska back with no consequences do you think they would?
[2:04:46] LukeStonks: The superior historical take is we should've combined forces with what remained of Germany's forces in 1945 and invaded Russia under Patton's command
[2:04:52] numblezzz: ukraine is filled with historical russian infrastructure. such as crimean port
[2:05:00] clozer_kek: If you don't know history, u r bound to repeat it
[2:05:03] Shuttlelol: Russia had already invaded Ukraine prior to 2021
[2:05:07] Greedygoose: @larnsmarf weird, cuz im not 58. youre off by a generation
[2:05:11] asdft90: @Doribob1 No such promise was ever made. Even Gorbachev said there never any agreement on NATO expansion.
[2:05:11] KCYON: NATO started this indirectly
[2:05:13] Fee1ing: almost  2 years

[2:05:33] shaotek: they shouldve invaded as soon as McCain led a revolution in ukr
[2:05:41] grizz430: so what would explain all the denazification and other bullshit reasons he gave?
[2:05:45] Shuttlelol: @KCYON NATO is a defensive pact, how can a defensive PACT trigger a invasion of a non-NATO country? LUL
[2:05:51] clozer_kek: America was at it's best pre 1913. tbh
[2:06:01] BigChoobs: @numblezzz holodomor was not perpetrated by ethnic Russians
[2:06:03] zkovgaard1: Civilians lots and lots of civilians too  then there also the american coup in 2014
[2:06:08] zkovgaard1: and it goes even further back
[2:06:09] marceltheold: They litterally voted to succed from Ukraine and got shelled for it
[2:06:11] asdft90: Putin will play victim as usual
[2:06:14] numblezzz: @grizz430 a lot of forces fighting in east ukraine are associated with nationalist, anti russian groups that use nazi symbology
[2:06:19] LockheartEXE: how would you feel about a chinese invasion of taiwan?
[2:06:22] Greedygoose: of course there are ethnic russians in eastern ukraine. thats by design. russia decided that border.
[2:06:25] KCYON: @Shuttlelol because the pact is full of countries that were on the other side of the cold war. because money. because US. its unfortunate

[2:06:42] concernedviewer4: Why claim that NATO agreed with Russia to not expand eastward? This agreement never happened formally.
[2:06:58] jonisyntinen: @Shuttlelol "nAtO iS a DeFeNsIvE pAcT" NotLikeThis
[2:06:59] LukeStonks: Do you think Putin poots?
[2:07:11] zkovgaard1: @hadrianbased he's been wanting to interview him for a long t ime, was supposed to be with fox even but they backed out
[2:07:14] skiills: the problem is the average person is so brainwashed and propagandized and sooooo bloody stupid this is all just a wash... chaos bolt rune or haunt for lvling a lock?
[2:07:14] clozer_kek: if you rub ur hands & look like a snake, u might want to change ur thinking
[2:07:17] grizz430: @grizz430 that may be true, but russian soldiers are literally wearing nazi patches on their uniforms, so doesn't seem like thwy have a problem with nazis

[2:08:22] TurboBased: fight every war and do everything or you lose chud
[2:08:27] zkovgaard1: Ukraine wont even exist as Ukraine even if it "wins". They are selling all their land to foreign (mostly U.S) companies. There's no sovereignty anymore if there ever was considering it is litterally one of the most corrupt countries in the world

[2:08:51] LukeStonks: America's media, products, entertainment, and cultural hegemony is so dominant over every country in the world. Every country is America's economic bitch. Other countries live to serve America and our dollar.
[2:08:55] KCYON: Would China take the #1 spot if they could? Russia? I would say its human nature. out of Patriotism

[2:09:53] KCYON: canada is falling down now

[2:12:26] 3kmmr7kskill: 70% of the chinese economy is investment spending whereas the US is 70% consumer.  investment in china has plummeted so yes it is not well currently
[2:12:27] devvastate: They have an economy? China is a paper dragon man. Smoke and mirrors all funded by the ccp being sarcastic to some degree.
[2:12:32] KCYON: @numblezzz huh. even then, in the large scale theres so much GDP that i dont imagine that would crumble their economy. but thats a big factor tbh
[2:12:32] zkovgaard1: @omarali118 doesn't matter , the crazy neocons in the u.s wants a war with them
[2:12:33] Humansoup: Yep

[2:12:54] Jibulol: all fake just like western "studies"
[2:12:55] CladeusXE: they have media black out
[2:12:56] KCYON: They will not reveal the full truth. maybe some truths, but never the full truth
[2:12:59] numblezzz: @KCYON yeah it wont "crumble" but its under a lot of pressure
[2:12:59] chattybadger: everyone wants to think we can just pretend like we havent had significant involvement in the politics of every country/region on the planet for many decades. in the words of louis CK, it's not as if we can just erase the past like a clean shit where we don't even have to wipe.
[2:13:00] fuguelah: their IQ data is bullshit, too
[2:13:01] omarali118: @zkovgaard1 Yeah but the other guy was right, the small hat dudes do control the USA
[2:13:05] Genghish: Everything under 2.2 is bad right?
[2:13:07] CptRagnvald: 1,4B
[2:13:09] clozer_kek: they don't respect women, never have. rip their pop
[2:13:10] Shuttlelol: CPP is reporting their own economy is falling, theyre reporting like -4% GDP

[2:13:16] larnsmarf: goose knws
[2:13:16] KCYON: @numblezzz gotcha makes sense

[2:13:34] jonisyntinen: Chinas economy is crumbeling but i could not say its collapsing
[2:13:35] concernedviewer4: I always imagined 50% of china living in rural straw huts anyway
[2:13:35] Genghish: Real
[2:13:36] LukeStonks: what is scroll wubba wubba
[2:13:37] Shuttlelol: China's replacement rate is horrid and they have zero immigration
[2:13:40] Shuttlelol: theyre fucked
[2:13:46] Shuttlelol: USA has immigration
[2:13:49] Shuttlelol: EZ Clap
[2:13:49] zkovgaard1: @omarali118 they really really don't, and it's ridiculous to say so, their interests may align now, but they do not run anything, it's crazy talk
[2:13:49] Humansoup: DinoDance
[2:13:50] KCYON: their surveillance is genuinely scary
[2:13:52] Greedygoose: china sent 18 divisions of barely clothed infantry in the winter in the korea war to fight the americans just because they could.
[2:13:52] omarali118: @Shuttlelol Zero immigration is good
[2:13:55] jexxy_ggs: and we have morons like Nick Cannon having 12 babies
[2:13:56] trebolz: CCP is totally washing it with propaganda and everything we hear from whistleblowers is usually Susge because we don't know if they are really a whistleblower
[2:14:06] soupxhot: doesn't S Korea have the lowest rate?
[2:14:06] Raewhen: thats why I wanna have 3-4 kids.

[2:14:25] marceltheold: When is the last time any of you actually read or watched the information coming out of the WEF or UN? If you dont know any of that your opinion is worthless tbh
[2:14:26] Shuttlelol: @omarali118 USA wouldnt exist without immigration, what are you talking about?
[2:14:27] arsenalenjoyer: genuine question
[2:14:34] basua2: @arsenalenjoyer kick the cast
[2:14:36] numblezzz: the biggest problem is not lack of women, but a larger population of elderly compared to population of young working force
[2:14:37] clozer_kek: they "dropped" their little girls. sad
[2:14:38] trebolz: 1.1 To every 1 woman
[2:14:45] hadrianbased: If in 100 years you replaced all of Han Chinese with Somalians, would it still be China?
[2:14:48] numblezzz: elderly rely on young workers
[2:14:50] KCYON: You run a character creation tool in the womans womb
[2:14:53] NaManDatAintMe: you throw them in the sparta pit
[2:14:58] arsenalenjoyer: I didnt know they were doing that, thats fucked
[2:15:01] Greedygoose: just like they select chicks at the chicken farms
[2:15:03] omarali118: @Shuttlelol I'm from the UAE for one, but second, the USA accepting immigration from anywhere and everywhere is bad because the culture becomes confused
[2:15:14] kaiju_kin: that was a thing for many decades too
[2:15:15] jexxy_ggs: I think the Single China males should just understand half of them will Die ALone and be ok with it... Sucks but thats what your country did.
[2:15:20] Genghish: Or hide them
[2:15:23] KCYON: there are chinese women here in canada (now grandma's) that highly encourage their kids to have as many kids as possible. 10-12 at times
[2:15:26] XarcTV: there are ways to have a better chance at boys or girls, to do with ovulation time
[2:15:28] trebolz: You wanna have more women than men in a society
[2:15:32] WiseguyGG: ya they ended it in 2016 now it’s 3 right

[2:15:41] Genghish: Not in chinese society i bet
[2:15:41] marceltheold: Americans have no understanding of how evil the rest of the world really is and form all these opinions from a sheltered and uneducated position
[2:15:46] TheEndIsNear777: china owns land in US = China Uprising and takeover YEP
[2:15:50] omarali118: @Shuttlelol UAE is where Dubai is, we're fine

[2:16:53] KCYON: LUL
[2:16:53] TheEndIsNear777: @Greedygoose :O
[2:16:54] Raewhen: Keep all those bad people out of the country. Fantastic plan.
[2:16:54] 125christian125: CIA intelligence agent
[2:16:57] 13deadace1: Shouldn't play with babies, you might not get to make more everytime as you keep choosing babies dudes
[2:16:57] KCYON: i would believe it
[2:16:58] Ruinx81: America, fuck yeah!
[2:17:08] Doribob1: @Shuttlelol shes here legally, bozo
[2:17:11] CptRagnvald: Sorry for putting out my personal view here, but as I see the few Chinese people I knew through my girlfriend, Chinese people do not care much about the outside world.
[2:17:12] coolcrazyguy72: Americans have the potential to be very smart. a lot of people struggle though
[2:17:13] marceltheold: Dont think you took it that way but I agree with you
[2:17:17] bone555: Why are americans so fat tho
[2:17:18] zkovgaard1: @omarali118 no man, what you're saying is ridiculous. do you even know how the political system and parties in israel looks like? it's a very thin and spread coalition that's about to crumble any day cause they CANT agree on anything. you sound like a tiktoker reading news for the first time
[2:17:20] Titty_Boyz: @staysafetv advertise power gum at the border?
[2:17:22] basua2: too bad you wont find some entity to pay you to shill these points lmao

[2:17:43] Genghish: Imagine the wall...
[2:17:49] numblezzz: correct
[2:17:52] KCYON: this is true, china is very focused on china
[2:17:53] coolcrazyguy72: you have an environment that lets you read any book, learn from any teacher, money is everywhere
[2:17:57] numblezzz: chinese culture is inherently inward looking
[2:18:04] imradioaktive: they think they are the center of the world
[2:18:05] 3kmmr7kskill: CHYNA
[2:18:15] marceltheold: China doesnt want to run the world. They just want to profit from it
[2:18:18] iMattbat: chyeena
[2:18:20] darkstarklife: all those completed boxes is about 1 quest
[2:18:25] clay024: Yeah, to their detriment at one point.
[2:18:26] c0gnusTV: they are not allowed to focus on the outside
[2:18:30] jexxy_ggs: 100% china only cares about china
[2:18:31] KCYON: @marceltheold huh. maybe you're right
[2:18:37] numblezzz: @imradioaktive to be fair, ancient sources in china refer to rome as "the other china"
[2:18:38] clozer_kek: I want to go on "holiday" outside of NA (outside of Canada or Mexico) at least a day on a plane :(
[2:18:39] Plokoon100: Kinda like Slovaks
[2:18:40] MechanizedTV: Unlike the US lol
[2:18:41] Zetherior: Other lands may as well be other planets
[2:18:41] 13deadace1: VoHiYo
[2:18:48] KCYON: 100 years of failure i think
[2:18:54] Shuttlelol: Chinese are racists against other Chinese, they view Hans as superior to other types of chinese
[2:18:59] KCYON: or something
[2:19:03] clay024: The Great Agreement was formed after it?
[2:19:10] send_it5010: 1000 years of shame
[2:19:16] KCYON: yes the shame
[2:19:18] afr0thundah: doesnt every country think they are better? like in US we do
[2:19:19] numblezzz: @Shuttlelol this is a western projection on chinese views of race
[2:19:19] Truckwood: @StaysafeTV because their government limits the info that makes it to their citizens, making them self-focused
[2:19:42] KCYON: just goes to show what ego and ideology can do to you
[2:19:44] ScarfaceCEO: Mandate of Heaven believers.
[2:19:48] bone555: Cccp vs nationalists vs japan
[2:19:53] trebolz: The great leap forward KEKW
[2:19:54] GahvMan: horde = china confirmed
[2:19:55] MasonismLive: They had to move whole cities to consolidate defenses against the Japanese
[2:19:56] yeti_noise: chinese horde
[2:19:59] marceltheold: If you read the UN plans for dividing the world China wants to become the hub of industry and technology and have their corner of dominance.
[2:20:01] skynnyrd: horde chinese
[2:20:02] asdft90: Staysafe you're so wrong. These small eastern europe nations literally BEGGED to join nato for protection. Also Poland literally blackmailed its way into NATO. They didn't just want to join, they were desperate to join
[2:20:04] Freenix: “century of humiliation” is most common term.
[2:20:07] clozer_kek: Japan very shogunistis during ww2
[2:20:13] sudd7: is that when they said dont attack us we have billions of people? lol
[2:20:14] Freenix: but it started before ww2
[2:20:18] KCYON: scarily fast
[2:20:19] Shuttlelol: they caught up by stealing technology
[2:20:19] 13deadace1: Probably nice before they did
[2:20:22] imradioaktive: stealing all our tech

[2:20:37] Eat_a_Cow: China make Wow, I love CHina
[2:20:45] numblezzz: the century of humiliation is the major cause of modern han self superiority. its just out of insecurity, they want to be respected like other super powers
[2:20:45] Thurman__1: whats crazy is China was way ahead like 2000+ years ago
[2:20:49] trebolz: KEKW

[2:20:58] Humansoup: LOL
[2:20:59] marceltheold: China has no problem letting the "West" run things so long as they have their corner and get wealthy. Thats why we sank billions into China 20 years ago
[2:21:02] Jibulol: africa is full of future doctors

[2:21:24] TheEndIsNear777: @Eat_a_Cow D:
[2:21:26] KCYON: Africa was ransacked by Europe in the 1800's mercilessly, and shut down whenever strong leaders came to power in the 20th century
[2:21:27] clozer_kek: so do all colors unfort
[2:21:36] omarali118: @Shuttlelol yikes

[2:22:18] cyonara74: so you guys ready for phase 2?
[2:22:20] hadrianbased: Africa copers always use European colonization for the 5,000 years of failures, but refuse to mention that Sub-Saharan Africans hadn't even invented the wheel before Europeans arrived
[2:22:21] marceltheold: What people dont understand is that the UN push for globalism is based in the religious beliefs of our ruling class. BTW its NOT Christianity or Judaism

[2:24:04] Sawfthandz: Four horsemen is here guy

[2:25:00] omarali118: @StaysafeTV That's been disproven. The Egyptians tried to give them everything via Nile trade and they just didn't get it. That's how it's taught to us anyways.
[2:25:00] Pimplejewce: ive also heard due to plateaus and no long slow rivers trade was kinda hard
[2:25:01] Eat_a_Cow: you also need intellect to have intellectual wealth.

[2:41:36] KCYON: lmfao
[2:41:38] ChillyHTX: BASEDRETARD
[2:41:41] Thurman__1: a lot of 14 year olds
[2:41:42] Utmost777: a lot of idiots
[2:41:45] handlights: holy fuck that's sad
[2:41:47] Voidbonx: BASEDHALT
[2:41:48] KCYON: if only channel 5 could cover Ukraine and Gaza
[2:41:48] Jibulol: Destiny debate when?
[2:41:51] numblezzz: i used to get all my news and politics from trade chat
[2:41:54] steevwtf: im surprised people like hasan, i was a lefty way back in the day and he was genuinely the dumbest mfer on TYT
[2:41:58] cyonara74: hassan is a capitalist
[2:42:07] Titty_Boyz: do you think most of those viewers take him seriously?
[2:42:08] hadrianbased: My favorite Ben Shapiro moment was when he was giving a speech in Israel, and he said he was only loyal to America so long as Israel exists
[2:42:11] Gamy1lol: Hasan content is like brain rot, that shit is weird
[2:42:12] neosenpai69: hasan support “hamas and houthis” piker
[2:42:13] scrubknightx: you ever consider getting another dog @StaysafeTV especially with new house
[2:42:19] 125christian125: hassan piker needs to fight sam hyde
[2:42:21] 13deadace1: What is age that twitch bans
[2:42:27] numblezzz: trade chat turned my from an unironic marxist into a demographic statistic linker
[2:42:28] KCYON: a lot of reading yeah
[2:42:33] arsenalenjoyer: Just call him ugly
[2:42:37] dave3ooo: no
[2:42:40] Utmost777: that is all he does on his stream, prep for debates
[2:42:40] arsenalenjoyer: and win the debate
[2:42:47] NutterCircus: That is what politicians are supposed to do. Sadge
[2:42:50] wtfbbqsauce: it was cool seeing you on the whatever podcast
[2:42:55] KCYON: what is the impact on your discourse? before even investing. sometimes it can be huge, sometimes.. you know.
[2:43:03] KCYON: but yeah true
[2:43:03] steevwtf: hasan just seems like a miserable human being when i see him on irl streams
[2:43:04] WarmWetTight: You don't need to debate, Rush never had anyone on
[2:43:04] ATcaribou: and around here, we spend out time farming boxes, not master debating
[2:43:11] Dovashh: Ive seen Trump debate he always wins
[2:43:16] NutterCircus: They get payed 170k+ Benefits
[2:43:16] KCYON: @ATcaribou master debating ;)
[2:43:19] 125christian125: you can be researched and still lose, debates appeal to emotion not logic
[2:43:33] Thurman__1: being a slippery debater
[2:43:36] dave3ooo: not to mention people who like that whole political debate culture, are some of the most toxic on the internet
[2:43:39] zkovgaard1: pierre bourdieu said you can't have a proper discussion if both  parties don't share the same information
[2:43:42] kaiju_kin: talking about rather than trying to solve anything or finding truth
[2:43:43] KCYON: true. you can "wind" things to your own way. there's also introspection on your intentions
[2:43:45] hadrianbased: Destiny is a perfect example of that
[2:43:45] Thurman__1: like David Pakman
[2:43:59] numblezzz: being a devil's advocate for ideologies you disagree with can make you very strong in debate
[2:44:12] BigChoobs: optics wins public opinion
[2:44:13] fuguelah: fuck dealing with Destiny like semantic tricks, verbal diarrhea, and sophistry
[2:44:15] Gamy1lol: Moulding facts to protect what you WANT to be the truth is something that will never make any sense to me
[2:44:16] NutterCircus: But the manipulative debater is pretty obvious to people who kknow.
[2:44:28] Jibulol: How you sell your point matters yeah
[2:44:30] KCYON: It would be a good exercise to "test" debaters and ask them "what are your intentions on this topic?" they often give themselves away with that type of question (you can feel out a lie)
[2:44:33] iMattbat: is there a good recent debate
[2:44:35] Thurman__1: depends on how good you are at displaying the truth.
[2:44:37] wtfbbqsauce: im a master bater
[2:44:39] LocoPollo1: dewD
[2:44:46] Dovashh: The secret to debating in politics is calling your opponents wife ugly
[2:44:48] NutterCircus: Policy of Truth is the best policy.
[2:44:56] KCYON: @Dovashh ^

[2:47:55] Smokjoker: sstvWAVE
[2:47:58] 13deadace1: Payo is a child in heart let him alone
[2:48:00] neosenpai69: What do you think about people getting mad about the use of retard? I’m 25 and atleast in my experience retard is just a casual thing you call people never have anyone I’ve known ever called actually retarded people a retard. kinda seems like weird behavior to get upset about it
[2:48:07] arsenalenjoyer: How do the boxes work?
[2:48:08] KCYON: box box box box box
[2:48:14] ChillyHTX: lmaoi

[2:48:44] WarmWetTight: Would you report a covert gdkp?
[2:48:45] wolfystyleftw: makes sense
[2:48:45] yellow657: how do you know its 160-200? the turn in isnt on ptr right now
[2:48:48] KCYON: If you call an actual retard a retard that's the real problem. unacceptable in that case.
[2:48:49] moffz0r: I've watched him, he's super weird
[2:48:53] windatar: @StaysafeTV What if you start in Orgimar? on phase 2 launch?
[2:48:59] linkitcraig: im saving that for 59 since it scales to your level
[2:49:02] Thurman__1: I think millennials grew up with that word
[2:49:07] ATcaribou: @yellow657 bc thats the exp they gave at lvl 24
[2:49:10] snoopychair: BASEDRETARD  󠀀
[2:49:16] KCYON: we did grow up with retard then it suddenly became offensive
[2:49:16] ceesaydsdbcn: yes
[2:49:25] KCYON: overly offensive*
[2:49:26] yellow657: @ATcaribou but didnt they say theyre substantially increasing it?
[2:49:30] ceesaydsdbcn: ok
[2:49:32] pioff: YOU THANK
[2:49:34] ceesaydsdbcn: thanks bro
[2:49:42] handovdoom666: he did, but he put it in a box
[2:49:48] itsnotkt: are u going to do the tourney ?
[2:49:53] ATcaribou: @yellow657 we dont think so. they said the new boxes will be substantially increased. if they increase these, its just a bonus
[2:49:55] kief770: where are you starting?
[2:49:56] linkitcraig: id save the cloth turn in for 50-60, get more xp for it
[2:49:56] KCYON: oh yeah the tourney
[2:49:58] neosenpai69: so are there going to lvl 25+ boxes? or just same boxes
[2:50:00] WarmWetTight: Imagine how quick Eminem would have been cancelled nowadays
[2:50:03] Gamy1lol: People mad about the retard word is exclusively an American thing
[2:50:03] TuggerTV: tach
[2:50:06] numblezzz: @KCYON even in younger generations, they started using the word "special" as an insult
[2:50:14] Thurman__1: March 15 I think
[2:50:16] numblezzz: no way to prevent kids being assholes lol
[2:50:20] yellow657: @ATcaribou intersting. thanks for the reply!
[2:50:31] neosenpai69: @gamy1lol that’s what I was thinking lol truly an American issue lmao
[2:50:38] KCYON: @numblezzz for sure, usually the boys would make fun of each other in that way, which imo is fine in that context
[2:50:40] ThrallsBigBalls: do you watch the Rogue Shobek?
[2:50:49] KCYON: its not preferred, but fine

[2:52:42] neosenpai69: Since we have MC lvl gear in phase 2. I would imagine that actual MC gear will be giga buffed along with actual raid difficulty? @staysafetv

[2:57:09] linkitcraig: i think the AR stuff is cooler, but costs way too much
[2:57:10] windatar: The world will be very different 20 years from now. 20 years ago, we barely had WoW, Pentium 3's were the most common computer and majority of the world didn't have internet.
[2:57:10] pinky93159: i get hella motion sickness from it i cant do VR

[3:26:05] originmorii: @steevwtf ok but if the gdkp community flooding into regular raids is going to make raids fail bc "theres no incentive to finish" then maybe its bc gdkp'ers have shit mentality towards the game and deserve to have gdkps banned FeelsWeirdMan

[3:32:27] hauserdot: there’s like 250 million Christians trapped in China
[3:32:37] Adrenacide: I thought CCP made it nearly impossible for them to leave the country? how are they leaving?
[3:32:39] BadGerbilLion: 20760 xp
[3:32:46] wuanluciano4: what if they lowered the xp for crates in phase 2

[3:34:42] kheap_: how do you like horde over alliance @StaysafeTV
[3:34:44] 4wardsjack: farming boxes sucks... until you hit like 50 and then its addicting
[3:34:47] Wingsofjanitor: send wow twitter a message asking for two week delay for P2 so you can farm more boxes NODDERS
[3:34:47] tepsx: i play alot and i feel like ive never not had anything to do

[3:34:58] yolomaster420blaze: is classic more popular then retail?

[3:38:07] Yeahmate: tier set take boot slot
[3:38:58] Vangomery: i think they might add some gear just like in p1
[3:39:05] steevwtf: this is the same company that produced OW2 and D4, i have absolute 0 faith in their decision making
[3:39:19] larnsmarf: i didnt know you got gear from doin the pvp.....
[3:39:28] larnsmarf: new world player new to wow
[3:39:32] timmeh_timbo: timmeh_timbo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! <3
[3:39:32] NutterCircus: We should just get by boxes and check them to pump the box. EleGiggle
[3:39:36] Voidbonx: LUL
[3:39:52] deathnntaxes: hi staysafe, hows your night going
[3:40:04] steevwtf: @larnsmarf nice i played a fuck ton of new world too, just quit a week ago, that game does combat 100% better than WoW
[3:40:31] deathnntaxes: your dedication to the grind is admirable
[3:40:32] steevwtf: @larnsmarf this shit is just tab 2222 tab 22223222
[3:40:38] JSHonigmann: I believe that is classic loot and not sod, it could be different. If you look at wsg loot they are different as well
[3:40:42] larnsmarf: if new world adds any thing like wsg or arathi basin im goin right back @steevwtf
[3:40:44] NutterCircus: I think they will...
[3:40:50] Salemanders: I feel like its pretty reasonable that they will
[3:40:53] scrubknightx: @steevwtf bro u just stopp playing new world?
[3:40:53] larnsmarf: im so ass at the pvp cuz i cant dodge or auto cancel :D
[3:40:57] originmorii: do we know if the game is going down at all right before phase 2?
[3:40:57] BigChoobs: every box giving 2k exp confirmed
[3:40:58] Salemanders: Didnt they say they were doing something with them>
[3:41:10] mattbarz989: id be afraid of not getting xp once you make it to the next rep threshhold
[3:41:14] NutterCircus: The catchup mechanics.
[3:41:14] steevwtf: @larnsmarf AGS is pure special ed, they fail at everything and are trying to cater to PvE players in a PvP game
[3:41:18] CrippinLimpin: be crazy if they did and you could get almost 29 off it all
[3:41:20] Etsku: didnt they say they will buff the boxes and bfd exp
[3:41:24] hauserdot: @nearoz123 I think your source is incorrect. for example you can look at the newborn death rates/mutations/ still borns across the world and places like Canada and in New Zealand where they had practically forced the jabs, the rates went from about 6% average to like 90% and 99% for Australia which is just one metric you can look at for some information. but I believe European countries suffered as well. It’s a global agenda involving the nwo.
[3:41:26] CrippinLimpin: that’d be poggers
[3:41:46] Frank4LuLz: PREGNANT?
[3:41:46] steevwtf: @scrubknightx ya i cant do it anymore, the combat in that game is next level but the company making it sucks so bad at everything

[6:58:27] Nisseffs: why wont they let 15-25 players hand in low level boxes for leveling?
[6:58:27] r0xorzb0xorz: how do you expect your lock to keep up with being able to solo SM? won't your gear be less effective for higher lvls? or is BFD gear that good?
