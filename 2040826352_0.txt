[2:40:04] lawnbird: strength and conditioning gyms are nice, like CrossFit without the creepy alt right vibe
[2:40:13] SetDog1: uh oh
[2:40:16] EzLawLz: I put my hood on and earphones on… trying to get to 405 bench

[2:41:10] heylowdub: nah crossfitters are usually conservative
[2:41:13] Mccdowwell: Some hardcore military dudes doing crossfit maybe
[2:41:14] SetDog1: what is crossfit?  different exercises?
[2:41:18] justeaton: peloton is far left EleGiggle
[2:41:22] sal_rl: Fitness in general in considered right wing
[2:41:26] ScarfaceCEO: Crossfit bros always hogging the equipment with their superset bullshit.  Annoying LUL
[2:41:27] sal_rl: is*
[2:41:30] FrandRandy: i saw some fat journo write an article about how being fit was right wing once lol

[2:41:59] jexxy_ggs: I live in Los Angeles.. Everyone is a Lib here though.
[2:42:00] bikersrocha: because it came from military training
[2:42:03] Vunoka: Is it more normal to talk to people in USA compared to EU? (im EU btw) @StaysafeTV
[2:42:06] EmanuShow: All gyms ive been to been very encouraging
[2:42:09] loops96: CrossFit is pretty cool but I also think it’s horribly homosexual. And everyone I’ve met that does CrossFit are usually arrogant cunts. My best gym experiences has always been traditional smaller body building gyms.
[2:42:11] bikersrocha: us bases
[2:42:12] sal_rl: I shoot up in the planet fitness shower area
[2:42:14] jexxy_ggs: @lampin_ its probably because im in Los angeles
[2:42:16] Vehicle_King: @sal_rl The American mind is so broken when it comes to "normal" weight and size. I too am 6'2" and found 195-200 to be optimal for me.
[2:42:18] Shepp22: you would only bring them with you to sell/buy

[2:43:00] jexxy_ggs: Find a cool HIIT gym thats not crossfit affiliated... Better community without the Kool-aid drinking
[2:43:00] latetoothegame: creatine is just necessary once ya hit 30
[2:43:02] Imdrasil89: I mean insulin is still a controlled substance and on the WADA list of prohibited substances
[2:43:07] seymourmoney: My gym buddy has type 1 and he's taking insulin constantly while at the gym. Does it out in the open as well as a joke
[2:43:11] zhuki: I'm leveling a female gnome right now and my son just ran by and saw your orc. He said it's way cooler and why can't I be that Sadge
[2:43:12] agentlank: SARMS are the new thing

[2:44:55] sighwarlock: NODDERS

[2:45:01] sighwarlock: 0-3 our Staymade
[2:45:05] Lunights: im just gonna wait and see what their queue changes are going to be
[2:45:05] srirachuhh_sauce: if i miss phase 1 is it that big of a deal ?
[2:45:06] handovdoom666: maybe it'll go better than your BFD run?
[2:45:11] seymourmoney: lets get a married couple WSG night
[2:45:18] EmanuShow: All i know that go to the gym go there to improve their physics and maybe some their mental health
[2:45:19] Mertauh: @vunoka It's a little less common in big cities like New York, but in smaller places everywhere, and even cities in the mid west and west coast its a part of the culture
[2:45:28] SetDog1: why wsg?  epics!
[2:45:30] skynnyrd: the grind is worth it but so miserable
[2:45:31] tecncaldificltes: 363 more losses to go YEP
[2:45:34] lampin_: also tabard is bis
[2:45:34] Joewrx: but we got until august until 60 so whats the rush
[2:45:37] Lionkingler1: super worth it
[2:45:53] lawnbird: even in NYC people talk to each other on the street, just maybe not when they’re trying to get to work

[2:46:35] SetDog1: hot yoga pilates
[2:46:39] daughtylock: 100% any kind of motion is good. Even if that "motion" is gardening.
[2:46:48] purpledrank210: weight lifting helps maintain / increase testosterone
[2:46:53] Vunoka: @Mertauh I despise citylife so thats not even on the radar. I was also way more drawn to the midwest/western parts of US
[2:47:17] SetDog1: after my shift at the oil change place, im heading over to the hot yoga pilates studio for a destressing session
[2:47:22] Vehicle_King: @LunaMoonCakey People are focused on their own workout/goals, they aren't paying attention to you. Staff can also help you figure out some workouts if you need guidance once you get inside the gym :)
[2:47:25] lawnbird: free warlock mount!
[2:47:36] Spudea: @LunaMoonCakey you don't need a gym, you can start in your home, do some home exercises for a few weeks, you'll start feeling better and then you can think about gym
[2:47:39] heylowdub: pre quest

[3:59:06] derbukki: They are basically telling Normies via our state financed media that the AfD is planning to deport migrants and build concentration camps again, its completely retarded. They are basically saying AfD is planning a coup. Utter insanity.

[4:04:56] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory that has no basis monkaHmm
[4:05:10] Mohrton: reminds me of the dwarf from the movie In Bruges explaining the race war
[4:05:15] sgmr: @StaysafeTV why was there basically nothing in his about his jolly ol time in Munich of 1919? pepeLaugh
[4:05:19] lagginginironforge: Why does western education fail so bad for WWII history? All we learned was, hitler one day woke up and decided to do mass genocide of the jews..
[4:05:21] hadeskrieg: every european are white
[4:05:46] Mohrton: @lagginginironforge are you looking for a motive ? lmao

[4:07:06] hadeskrieg: that's gonna be rough
[4:07:11] Mohrton: @StaysafeTV whats more dangerous biden or haley?
[4:07:14] NutterCircus: US will just turn in to a slave camp.
[4:07:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: And here's why that's a good thing.
[4:07:19] Lionkingler1: YEP
[4:07:21] megahebes: monkaS

[4:07:22] malvy1: ww3
[4:07:22] Derezzed01: if trump loses the election, we go into an economic depression
[4:07:26] Slitze: u mean future democratic voters
[4:07:27] regalbeast: mexico-lite
[4:07:32] sgmr: yeah we have pics of him attending the funeral of kurt eisner, the leader of that communist bavarian state... well guess thats what you gotta do being a twice elected battalion representative to the soviets of that "country"
[4:07:33] tsetse2fly: Will Biden even live 5 years more?
[4:07:35] baptyzmbyf1re: bring them here legally and make them citizens. they will freaking work.  just need them paying taxes and being part of the system.  why is this so freaking hard?
[4:07:36] snoopychair: also trump probably wont run after that
[4:07:39] TheEndIsNear777: 4 more years of boe jiden = emboldened countries ready to war because who's afraid of boe jiden :p
[4:07:43] cafrozed: 4 more years of biden would ensure the invasion of taiwan and WW3
[4:07:47] lagginginironforge: Biden wont make 5 years
[4:07:52] Mohrton: @baptyzmbyf1re LOL
[4:07:53] Lionkingler1: DONOTCUM
[4:07:58] KCYON: taiwan is inevitable imo sadly
[4:07:59] EmanuShow: If trump looses the election there will be things that cant be reversed
[4:08:06] wookieenthal: Cumala
[4:08:10] marceltheold: Not to sound to crazy but I dont think we are going to make it to the election without something insane happening. To the point that they will force mail only ballots because of Marshal Law of some kind
[4:08:11] zhuki: will trump be alive in 5 years? he aint lookin super healthy these days
[4:08:12] BigQonU: World War 3 has already started
[4:08:12] iBanEvader: ww3 not

[4:08:14] wookieenthal: DONOTCUM
[4:08:15] iBanEvader: taiwan is possible
[4:08:17] re5onxnce: biden looks like he was actually soul drained
[4:08:39] cafrozed: biden is weaker then jimmy carter and that's why the chinese will invade is my point
[4:08:39] Lionkingler1: put one carrier strike group next to the island and china cant do shit
[4:08:42] cafrozed: they wouldn't try it under trump
[4:08:43] ANGEL_7_17_1972: No, we are giving them America
[4:08:46] pottatowtv: Yeah but all the wacko progressives will be out in force supporting China
[4:08:46] NutterCircus: See, all that mage had to do was sheep over and over.
[4:08:53] Derezzed01: also North korea attempts on S. Korea
[4:08:58] EmanuShow: It would be another ukraine
[4:09:10] GunTheRedneck: IDK with the focus biden has started putting on manufacturing chips here in the US, i wouldnt be surprised if this admin didnt get involved with taiwan if china did do something
[4:09:14] KCYON: biden has mentioned he doesnt find taiwan as a legitimate "trade partner", or something of considerable importance, forgot
[4:09:18] TheEndIsNear777: i don't mind the majority vote but when the majority is against god = bad
[4:09:26] Lionkingler1: YEP easy fix

[5:11:51] Adrenacide: no, he hasn't changed, he's an idiot
[5:11:52] iBanEvader: he will always take the side of muslims that's why he's also pro-houthi
[5:11:54] peepopeaches: @Mohrton a champagne socialist
[5:11:55] cristianovic27: his reason is because he is muslim not communist, muslims hate jews

[5:12:25] MC_WhiteNoiz: In regards to Antifa at least

[5:12:29] iBanEvader: I can empathise a little bit with Houthis but the way they are disrupting world economy is scandalous
[5:12:32] Mipolarization: Frequent Hasan watcher..... Oof. That's a rough one.

[5:20:47] tacklenfuel: thats right staysafe is a diamond in the rough
[5:20:48] MC_WhiteNoiz: I don't think labels are useful in meaningful discussion. I think we assume too much when discussing topics.

[6:34:30] MC_WhiteNoiz: I think we are in the infancy of the universe, and we are just the beginning of something much much larger in the future
[6:34:34] iBanEvader: I think it is possible
[6:34:36] LafielAbriel: battlestar galactia ?
[6:34:37] tacklenfuel: @Bronsonchef i dont i was bored
[6:34:41] blakeshow: Hello friend
[6:34:43] Bronsonchef: I was happier
[6:34:44] VrtniPatuljak: the great filter. we always get to nukes then restart
[6:34:49] iBanEvader: Atlantis
[6:34:51] Gealls: no
[6:34:52] literalmountgod: its possible
[6:34:53] Mickrispy: Like the Persian Empire
[6:34:58] Ropy123: Ming dinasty
[6:34:58] Humansoup: @StaysafeTV Antikythera mechanism
[6:35:00] EmanuShow: You talking about UR now, a civilization wiped out by famine overgrowing itself?
[6:35:02] Zolshy89: Fuck no
[6:35:15] gigera6653: uhh source, chudd
[6:35:18] VrtniPatuljak: Roman aquaducts still work
[6:35:21] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV there's so many greek philosophers and intellectuals who talked about an ancient ruin city
[6:35:21] seksmuhchine: geophysicist uhh rocks say huh?
[6:35:28] Link9286: marble and granite would preserve well
[6:35:30] iBanEvader: like atalantis
[6:35:30] Mickrispy: Real question, when does the world become one nation?
[6:35:32] uppdrag_frihet: BroScience Archeology Class 101
[6:35:36] Bronsonchef: Look it up The Antikythera mechanism is basically a wonder of the world
[6:35:41] MC_WhiteNoiz: Yeah, there are some full on buildings that existed here in the states that you can't even tell anything existed on that land.
[6:35:47] letsgetgoingyo: @Mickrispy never, it is biologically impossible
[6:35:47] VrtniPatuljak: Roman concrete was stronger than ours and still stands
[6:35:50] PrunJuice: it's possible some civilizations could have existed, but we still have fossils from 3.5 billion years ago. a civilization from 200k years in the past would leave some traces.
[6:35:52] Humansoup: Loss tech
[6:35:57] PrunJuice: if it was in any way large
[6:35:59] Mickrispy: @letsgetgoingyo Sadge
[6:36:02] iBanEvader: also there's a lot of technology forgotten over time
[6:36:03] Seoken1: thats actually true roman concrete was a different mix than ours, much stronger
[6:36:29] MC_WhiteNoiz: I think we would have seen more evidence of thath.
[6:36:39] Mickrispy: I wouldn't say "ages", maybe a few people accidently discovered it but it didn't spread into an "age"
[6:36:39] MC_WhiteNoiz: I think it's because you don't really go back from that.
[6:36:41] letsgetgoingyo: @Mickrispy why is that sad? having thousands of different cultures and peoples is what makes humanity amazing
[6:36:43] uppdrag_frihet: yeah Maybe
[6:36:44] wookieenthal: Saturn's moon Iapetus was a secret alien vacation spot
[6:36:53] Seoken1: Right there were between 8-10 different subhuman species on the Earth that we KNOW about, Neanderthals ruled longer than humans have
[6:36:54] gigera6653: they rewrite history all the time, just recently they found advanced metal working in northern sweden at the same time the romans were discovering it
[6:36:57] VrtniPatuljak: tower of Babel is in the Bible as a great civ that failed
[6:36:58] doloriferous: Agriculture of the Sumerians began agriculture around 10000 years ago
[6:37:04] AceOfFlame: only way we are leaving planet earth is if humanity becomes one society
[6:37:21] Mickrispy: @letsgetgoingyo I suppose
[6:37:30] Seoken1: collapse is a natural part of history
[6:37:32] Seoken1: it repeats
[6:37:33] iBanEvader: those roman cities are complete gone in even 500 years
[6:37:40] Humansoup: The Antikythera mechanism is a mechanical calculator. It was an Ancient Greek analogue computer and orrery. It was discovered in 1902 in a shipwreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece.
[6:37:45] seksmuhchine: possible
[6:37:45] iBanEvader: completely*
[6:37:50] Barewood: you leveling the warlock first phase 2??
[6:37:53] Mickrispy: NOPERS
[6:37:56] MC_WhiteNoiz: Yeah, I think I agree with what you're saying. In enough time the earth eats it all.
[6:37:56] Marwinzz: Bro people barely lived to their 40s, half their time is spent growing up and other half providing. Now consider how few people existed back then. Of course they didnt just bang sticks on rocks but I think you're overestimating how much they could truly achieve.
[6:37:57] S_Aljallaf: i remember back in 8th grade when i first read about the annunaki and the nephilim LMAO
[6:38:00] seksmuhchine: any evidence
[6:38:03] Humansoup: Yeah
[6:38:09] wookieenthal: any primers?
[6:38:22] Dmaceee: Hello @StaysafeTV
[6:38:28] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV to this day we still find new archeological things from ancient civilisations and it's only been 10k years
[6:38:29] uppdrag_frihet: @letsgetgoingyo as long as it doesn't get in the way of the realization of our mutual humanity
[6:38:41] Link9286: Link9286 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! check out "Life after People" series to see how long evidence  of civiliations would last
[6:38:43] Bronsonchef: Yeah it wasn't possible to be around at that time due to how limited current advancements were @StaysafeTV
[6:38:47] Mickrispy: Will humans create their own downfall, like in Robots or subspecies of humans?
[6:39:07] iBanEvader: @MC_WhiteNoiz to this day we still find new archeological things from ancient civilisations and it's only been 10k years
[6:39:13] Humansoup: Yep
[6:39:19] AceOfFlame: @Marwinzz people living in their 40s nearly never existed and died as early in 20s because of constant war, disease and famine
[6:39:20] iBanEvader: @MC_WhiteNoiz stuff goes away super fast over time
[6:39:29] iBanEvader: and that's only 10k years
[6:39:31] Barewood: @staysafetv you leveling the  lock first phase 2?
[6:39:31] letsgetgoingyo: @tekeneken different people will never want to live the same way, so trying to put people together in a homogenized fashion will create endless conflict
[6:39:35] Humansoup: Sounds like a really BIG FLOOD
[6:39:37] ohioliving: ancient city outlines in amazon forest
[6:39:41] Titus7: If we were sent back to the stone age now, we'd never recover again as there's no readily available coal deposits near the surface anymore
[6:39:47] AcumenIRL: There are tunnels under the Sphinx. Access blocked to most
[6:39:47] flob888: can you show talents please my friend?
[6:39:48] PaaLenTier: let’s go dig in Antarctica
[6:39:50] Bronsonchef: I bet Atlantis is out there
[6:39:55] Mickrispy: Just time till we find Hollow Earth peepoNerd
[6:40:06] NermChermsker: Angkor Wat in Cambodia too. The locals knew of its existence, but that’s another lord civilization.
[6:40:11] seksmuhchine: how many photos from before film
[6:40:16] NermChermsker: *lost
[6:40:19] Zarlus: @Bronsonchef Atlantis is in the NW part of Africa covered by sand.
[6:40:24] VrtniPatuljak: @Titus7 you can make coal from wood, humans are resourseful
[6:40:26] iknowido: easter island statues are crazy
[6:40:27] LiquidOctopus: most of the mayan's ruins in chiapas are still covered in jungle
[6:40:38] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV we moved from our old house in a rural area and went back after 6 months and nature had totally taken over everything
[6:40:40] uppdrag_frihet: @letsgetgoingyo yea but I think some people simply like different cultures better than others and if we are not able to "switch" because of ego etc then we are doomed aswell
[6:40:41] iBanEvader: it goes fast as fuck
[6:41:00] MC_WhiteNoiz: That Tartoast character was very handsome.
[6:41:03] tacklenfuel: i dont even want to imagine the horror of disease killing off tribes
[6:41:08] gigera6653: sea level has changed hundreds of meters
[6:41:11] Zarlus: @tekeneken Yes, everyone just abandon their peoples culture... so we all have a hodge podge of nonsense as a culture.
[6:41:13] Mickrispy: None of this will matter once we start living on the Moon :)
[6:41:19] letsgetgoingyo: @tekeneken thats why nations are important. Different people can cultuvate their own socities how they see fit, and you can move where you prefer.
[6:41:26] PaaLenTier: it’s rebuilding itself with its own eco
[6:41:29] AceOfFlame: well yeah, we cant stop mother nature, mother nature has always been a major cause of war being turned
[6:41:32] LiquidOctopus: the government wont invest in exploring mayan ruins covered in jungñe
[6:41:34] NermChermsker: Except for the Russians who dug new trenches there a while ago lol
[6:41:35] uppdrag_frihet: @letsgetgoingyo I like that idea.
[6:41:39] MC_WhiteNoiz: @Zarlus You realize culture is forever changing right?
[6:41:45] zaria_dh: i find it wild they used the other reactors for about 15 years before shutting it down
[6:41:50] Zarlus: @MC_WhiteNoiz No its not..
[6:41:53] fitrick: holy shit justy got a 35 blue boe
[6:42:03] uppdrag_frihet: @Zarlus not what I'm saying.
[6:42:06] fitrick: robes of the magi
[6:42:08] MC_WhiteNoiz: @Zarlus Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize we all behave the same way we did 5000 years ago.
[6:42:11] fitrick: probs dogshit now lol
[6:42:16] Zarlus: @MC_WhiteNoiz African culture has not changed since the begining of time before the flood
[6:42:18] seksmuhchine: i can sell chat an image of sasquatch
[6:42:26] letsgetgoingyo: @tekeneken thats how humanity has worked forever. The big problem happens when people start ramming everyone together that do not fit. Its called globalism and its cancer
[6:42:34] MC_WhiteNoiz: @Zarlus oh boy, not even going to engage with you. Incredibly low IQ. Have fun in life.
[6:42:54] Zarlus: @MC_WhiteNoiz we d o, certain people are certain ways.  Thats why whites are taken advantage of while blacks get affirmative action everywhere in  america
[6:43:01] iBanEvader: @Zarlus that's very wrong lol
[6:43:08] Zarlus: @MC_WhiteNoiz I actually scored a high percentile of IQ, but okay.
[6:43:15] MC_WhiteNoiz: "blacks" lol there it is
[6:43:22] Zarlus: @iBanEvader So africa doesnt still murder, steal, rape, and destroy?
[6:43:23] PaaLenTier: we found our resident rasist
[6:43:27] tacklenfuel: ive been to the ruins in cancun thats pretty cool
[6:43:30] uppdrag_frihet: @letsgetgoingyo I agree. It has to happen in a more natural way - not a forced way and not through consumerist globalism. Well functioning societies/nations can move towards having less stricter barriers for inviting others in a functional way.
[6:43:45] doloriferous: making a premade DansGame
[6:43:55] iBanEvader: @Zarlus what has to that to do with cultural changes
[6:43:58] voreal22: hunters are the best healers
[6:44:10] tacklenfuel: how did you replay your old messages
[6:44:13] iBanEvader: @Zarlus murder, stealing, raping and destroying things happen all over the world
[6:44:14] tacklenfuel: i forgot
[6:44:14] MC_WhiteNoiz: @voreal22 I love when they heal me with arrows
[6:44:26] Zarlus: @iBanEvader They havent changed, they still do the same thing in america... billions of dollars and what has africa to show for it?
[6:44:30] tacklenfuel: tyty
[6:44:31] doloriferous: What are your thoughts on the younger dryas impact theory
[6:44:34] MC_WhiteNoiz: Woah... actually a healing arrow rune would be cool
[6:44:36] Humansoup: I'm only lvl 22 lol
[6:44:40] voreal22: @MC_WhiteNoiz yes untill they forget to buy arrows
[6:44:46] MC_WhiteNoiz: @voreal22 LMAO
[6:44:59] iBanEvader: @Zarlus how old are you?
[6:45:09] Zarlus: @iBanEvader 32
[6:45:12] letsgetgoingyo: @tekeneken you still have the wrong idea. You dont want people to meld together, that is what erodes peoples cultures and creates so much conflict. The barriers are exactly what preserves a diversity of cultures.
[6:45:17] tacklenfuel: im not queueing with yet
[6:45:20] tacklenfuel: >< ><
[6:45:27] MC_WhiteNoiz: @Zarlus What part of the US?
[6:45:32] flob888: hey my friend, can you show your talents pls?
[6:45:34] iBanEvader: @Zarlus even kids nowadays are very different than when you were a kid
[6:45:43] Ropy123: hi
[6:45:44] doloriferous: hi :)
[6:45:47] iBanEvader: @Zarlus they talk diffreent, they act different, they think different
[6:45:47] tacklenfuel: hi
[6:45:48] OptimusBanana420: hi :)
[6:45:51] Humansoup: Hi sstvLOVE
[6:45:51] Wrettchh: hi :)
[6:46:01] Buttsworth: hi
[6:46:02] Ropy123: I'm not new
[6:46:04] Xammy0: hi :)
[6:46:05] nach7vos: howdy
[6:46:06] flob888: thank you
[6:46:06] tacklenfuel: welcome welcome
[6:46:09] uppdrag_frihet: @letsgetgoingyo That's why I said "in a functional way" because that means to me that the culture/society still recognizes the importance of keeping the culture going and functional.
[6:46:12] iBanEvader: @Zarlus same thing happens in Africa
[6:46:17] letsgetgoingyo: @tekeneken if you have 10 cups of different colors, the barriers are what keeps them seperate. If you pour them all in the same bowl, you get one color - grey/brown and all the diversity is gone.
[6:46:20] Zarlus: @iBanEvader Not so different than you think, nothing new has happened since the dawn of time... just different names, circumstances etc.
[6:46:22] gigera6653: we're rapidly entering a new phase of humanity... we shall call it...
[6:46:36] iBanEvader: @Zarlus dude we are all using the internet over the globe now
[6:46:42] iBanEvader: @Zarlus smartphones
[6:46:46] iBanEvader: @Zarlus television
[6:46:49] Goldbowser: without bots and without RMT i believe GDKP could be the best loot system.
[6:46:52] iBanEvader: @Zarlus so much has changed
[6:46:54] literalmountgod: true
[6:47:01] Xammy0: absolutely
[6:47:07] tacklenfuel: they cant stop the truth anymore, the internet is the goat
[6:47:07] MC_WhiteNoiz: It's the most substantial, we are a hivemind now. It's kinda scary. I'm ready to go nomad.
[6:47:12] Zarlus: @iBanEvader Yes, africans even hate black americans. Yet they are the same outside of traditionalism.   Blacks in america dont do nuclear family, sit on welfare while in africa they having 10 kids just to eat 1 or sell them to someone.
[6:47:35] NermChermsker: @zarlus you need to travel
[6:47:41] MC_WhiteNoiz: We decide the truth collectively now. Regardless of reality.
[6:47:47] VinoHuncho: what rank are you boss?
[6:47:54] Zarlus: @NermChermsker I literally have, I have done more than enought to know better via wisdom
[6:47:56] Humansoup: True
[6:48:02] Xammy0: the internet has destroyed trust in many long existing institutions
[6:48:07] easyafff: batgasm started stream. see you later
[6:48:09] TurboBased: i think thats why things seem to be hastening
[6:48:11] uppdrag_frihet: AI will come with its challenges lol
[6:48:24] ryufromstreets6: dead internet theory is wild
[6:48:24] MC_WhiteNoiz: We have gotten this far in the universe with controlled media... just saying
[6:48:27] Humansoup: Yep .. We want you to look at THIS ...
[6:48:34] Wrettchh: bots arguing with bots
[6:48:50] NermChermsker: @zarlus oh cool. I grew up in Africa. But you know the most im sure
[6:48:53] iBanEvader: @TurboBased agree, things only change faster
[6:48:57] Ropy123: @Wrettchh bots will join forces and take over humanity
[6:49:16] gigera6653: a lot of it is controlled, globally
[6:49:17] Zarlus: @NermChermsker Yes all of africa is not worthy of being in america... 13% doing 60% of all violence... they didnt assimulate...
[6:49:23] MC_WhiteNoiz: media is crucial in creating a cohesive narrative for people to exist in. Ironically the traditionalists are pro freedom of speech online when the control of speech is how we moved as one.
[6:49:26] Xammy0: sounds like The Patriots at the end of MGS2
[6:49:42] HARLS25: put in my two weeks at my job and am ready to start a new chapter wish me luck
[6:49:53] artilectXLII: ...are you talking about POG - Psychological Operations Group?
[6:49:54] NermChermsker: @zarlus my dude, if you could spell, I’d maybe actually pay attention
[6:50:06] NutterCircus: Media Matters PauseChamp
[6:50:08] Vehicle_King: C OMEGALUL WB OMEGALUL YS
[6:50:09] iBanEvader: @Zarlus you're a clown, you can't be high iq with all the shit you regurgitate
[6:50:18] gigera6653: someone can make a new internet network only via satellite, a stronger starlink
[6:50:23] Zarlus: @NermChermsker Ah yes, because my grammer isnt perfect my arguement is null and void... lol you are the reason why the world is ran by evil men.  Grow a spine
[6:50:32] TurboBased: holy shit
[6:50:37] Zarlus: @iBanEvader Sure, Gues you think bobby fischer is retarded too huh
[6:50:39] Vehicle_King: How bout them cowboys!
[6:50:45] jiggsawpuzzlemanes: What should we prep for P2?
[6:50:45] literalmountgod: packers smoked them
[6:50:58] VinoHuncho: 🤠 = 💩
[6:51:00] tacklenfuel: i hear china has internet 2.0
[6:51:01] dave3ooo: imagine caring what any random entity has to say on the internet LUL
[6:51:04] MC_WhiteNoiz: Wait, so you are NOT an AI?
[6:51:06] Fluff_McGruff_: do you think people will wise up to how fucked the internet is for us and step away from it?
[6:51:19] NermChermsker: @zarlus Yes. You sound stupid.
[6:51:20] Humansoup: True and true
[6:51:26] NutterCircus: How bout them Indians vs buffalos?
[6:51:36] ryufromstreets6: the internet will more or less become unusable at a certain point in terms of general "browsing" for things
[6:51:36] Vehicle_King: welp good thing all these for-profit companies are developing AI KEKL
[6:51:42] iBanEvader: @Fluff_McGruff_ only people in power (politicians) can make laws/rules around it but they are veeeeryyy slow
[6:51:46] Zarlus: @NermChermsker Ah yes I sound stupid to a arrogant person who doesnt know any better... Not a suprise there
[6:51:49] MC_WhiteNoiz: I actually read a few books on that this year
[6:52:01] duncandangerous: yep
[6:52:01] MC_WhiteNoiz: Look to the Amish, they pick and choose their tech.
[6:52:03] gigera6653: totalitarian regimes have never had it better
[6:52:19] tacklenfuel: amish were ahead of the curve
[6:52:38] Vehicle_King: My neighbor just got his 9 year old daughter a phone. RIP to that bozo
[6:52:39] Zarlus: Yeah, your birth certificate is your parents signing away your rights as a human to the state/gov
[6:52:43] MrBulkzilla: Morning Staysafe (soon 09:00 AM here)
[6:52:55] artilectXLII: with internet we have global-panopticon... social-media fits the definition of panopticon; everyone see everyone else, everyone feels like they are watched, and from guard-towers someone gets sniped, and everyone sees, and everyone is worried about themselves...
[6:52:55] Humansoup: AI Fake BS incoming
[6:53:11] tacklenfuel: @Vehicle_King would be better if it was his phone she was using
[6:53:12] NutterCircus: If the powers that be dont like it, it will have counter bots going against it.
[6:53:24] MC_WhiteNoiz: I personally don't believe the internet should be anonymous. We do not exist in an anonymous reality. And that is a lot of the issue with the internet. People don't behave the same as they would IRL
[6:53:50] Vehicle_King: @Vehicle_King perhaps, but nope. new iphone.
[6:53:51] iBanEvader: that would be a good thing
[6:53:52] MC_WhiteNoiz: The internet is also a tool. Not a birth right. It's a megaphone, not your voice.
[6:53:59] Humansoup: Thats why I like going to Chuch.. like minded people in the Fleash
[6:54:10] Moodzilla: encryption helps
[6:54:23] Vehicle_King: 99% of people just simply dont care. bread and circuses works on them too well
[6:54:28] gigera6653: analog guerrillas
[6:54:28] Humansoup: Flesh *
[6:54:28] chatgpttwitchbot: gg

[6:54:43] Tobssessxic: PogU
[6:54:55] KrotonGG: Ill send you me key bro
[6:55:18] PrunJuice: it's not so difficult to tie an identity to online accounts. korea already does it with many games etc. the bot thing is not an unsolvable problem.
[6:55:18] Humansoup: @zarlus tThats why i said i like to go with like minded people :)
[6:55:37] NutterCircus: AI would be able to use PKI LUL
[6:55:39] seksmuhchine: if the key doesn't involve palworld

[6:55:45] fitrick: jerk off
[6:55:46] craboskai: give streamers my money :)
[6:55:47] ryufromstreets6: online "communities" like discord servers will just be infested with bots talking to eachother with AI voice capabilities that are indistinguishable from a real human
[6:55:48] Xammy0: JERK OFF
[6:55:48] Vehicle_King: photoshop an image of a hand with only 5 fingers KEKL
[6:55:49] Koshintu: type completely random retarded nonsense when drunk

[6:55:58] chatgpttwitchbot: @PrunJuice  u dont understand how bots work
[6:55:59] DshaunMusterd: lmao
[6:56:00] tacklenfuel: at what point does the computer have to prove to me its not a bot and me not doing all this dumb authent
[6:56:05] iBanEvader: a lot of people didn't believe bots could make it to 60 LUL
[6:56:07] Ropy123: LUL
[6:56:26] PrunJuice: @c0keg4ming are you perhaps a bot? Pepega
[6:56:29] MC_WhiteNoiz: Yeah at a certain point if anything can be anything, then everything is nothing. We will reject all tech like they did in Final Fantasy
[6:56:29] Humansoup: lil p ?
[6:56:36] MC_WhiteNoiz: MY EMAIL STOP LEAKING
[6:56:38] tacklenfuel: greasy
[6:56:43] chatgpttwitchbot: @PrunJuice  blizzard can instantly ban all bots they choose not too

[7:05:36] Fladius: Regarding the pyramids, the most obvious explanation tends most of the time to be the correct one. Just like a person who used steroids and claimed to be 100% natty probably has the character to viewbot. So most likely the Egyptians did build the pyramids.
[7:05:40] EmanuShow: Ye MC
[7:05:43] Ropy123: is Staysafe gona buy his own private island ?

[7:10:17] Pooping_Sunflower_Seeds: that is what a lot of middle east says, its powerful for sure
[7:10:23] MC_WhiteNoiz: @c0keg4ming I don't think that's a question. Drugs are the fastest way to funnel money. It's how we built up individuals world wide that worked with the US
[7:10:35] tacklenfuel: that doesnt mean there isnt people who believe their pushing gods agenda. you have to protect yourself still
[7:10:40] Vicente_Prime: SENBD IT

[7:13:15] drunk_hunk: us is the biggest drug market in the world

[7:25:29] EmanuShow: I dont care if they atheist, to me atheism is belief of non believing so ye
[7:25:31] Humansoup: In Luke 7:37-50, an immoral woman of the streets, known to all to be a prostitute, knelts at the feet of Jesus in front of all the guests.0 There is no place in the Bible where it says that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute
[7:25:31] seksmuhchine: i'm a catholic so ateism is implied

[7:27:42] chambliiddoo: and I know quite a few Muslim people who are some of the most fun people to hangout with, party wild! and they are all ethnicities
[7:27:44] Comadrinn: The Atheist movement slowed/died down precisely because of the huge rise of Islam - the power dynamic was painfully obvious
[7:27:50] S_Aljallaf: @JohnWick_QQ we are jesus fanboys already...
[7:27:54] zodd_amhai: fuck zionism
[7:27:58] Avenia: because fuck sionism
[7:28:01] SupreemLeeder11: NODDERS justified
[7:28:01] Avenia: zionism*
[7:28:04] MC_WhiteNoiz: It's because we've been scared to say anything. We can finally speak

[7:28:53] tacklenfuel: we are but a vessel
[7:28:54] Arcsilin: plenty of anti zionist jews out there
[7:28:58] letsgetgoingyo: zionism is just jewish nationalism. Its natural for jews to be zionist
[7:29:06] EmanuShow: I think we should seperate jew by default to be zionist
[7:29:10] Dracksar: kinda of racist to say all jews are zionists
[7:29:15] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo not at all
[7:29:18] Buttsworth: weren't the jews a nomadic people for like ever?
[7:29:18] MC_WhiteNoiz: It's their shield unfortunately
[7:29:28] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo Zionism is the extremeist take of it.

[7:29:40] EmanuShow: Zionism with z what the heck is that anyway
[7:29:50] Sal_con: Bro I saw tiktok of a American israel dual citizenship dude going to israel fighting in gaza and coming back to america and hugging  his kids..... most of the palestinians that have been killed are kids
[7:29:51] crawley151: zion williamson is crushing it for the pelicans this year
[7:30:05] Buttsworth: @EmanuShow i think its belief israel should exist could be wrong
[7:30:06] Arcsilin: remember when kanye went on his rant LOL
[7:30:09] JohnWick_QQ: @S_Aljallaf so your not muslim, then it wasnt for you :)
[7:30:09] letsgetgoingyo: @Avenia no, zionism is the belief that jews belong in their ancestral homeland where they can govern their own affairs. Having a state. like other peoples. Its literally just jewish nationalism
[7:30:18] tacklenfuel: @Arcsilin which one
[7:30:18] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo thats extremism
[7:30:20] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo zionism is imperialism
[7:30:26] Arcsilin: @Arcsilin the info wars shit
[7:30:31] EmanuShow: Ye but isnt it really spelled sion instead of zion
[7:30:32] S_Aljallaf: @JohnWick_QQ oh nooo
[7:30:35] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo beleiving you 'Belong" anywhere is a true extremism
[7:30:37] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader how so? Palestine is the jewish homeland lol
[7:30:42] Nek0r: wtf are you talking about, Israel has been criticized since its creation

[7:32:18] Zahnstocherzimtstern: since Israel bombed the shit out of Palestin, my "guild" as Austrian is kinda evaporated
[7:32:22] XarcTV: TRUE
[7:32:30] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo history doesn't mean a fucking thing
[7:32:33] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader romans were invaders
[7:32:35] MC_WhiteNoiz: If Jesus came back he would be crucified again. He'd be "Woke"
[7:32:41] tacklenfuel: Eeeeeek
[7:32:44] EmanuShow: Im more of native belief, who really owns the land :P
[7:32:44] Londowa: true
[7:32:44] SameOldVagga: How was it guesting the Whatever podcast? @StaysafeTV
[7:32:49] JohnWick_QQ: jesus is rapturing his church before the temple gets rebuild
[7:32:52] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo all land is invaded at some time in history
[7:32:59] Humansoup: I agree it's rough when my 18yr son just join the army
[7:33:00] Nek0r: @iBanEvader oh really ? so what does mean a thing ?
[7:33:02] XarcTV: i mean its prophecy right so its gonna happen either way with support or not
[7:33:10] fitrick: anti-christ behaviour
[7:33:23] tacklenfuel: youve gotten stream sniped this time imo
[7:33:29] iBanEvader: @Nek0r it means Israel shouldn't just try to invade other territories with violence
[7:33:31] tacklenfuel: blown up
[7:33:40] iBanEvader: @Nek0r they should be better than the terrorists that attacked them
[7:33:45] NutterCircus: Some Rabbis believe Israel should not exist till the Messiah arrives.
[7:33:46] iBanEvader: @Nek0r they should know better after WW2
[7:33:49] nemcoy: will soloing stockades as meta lock be a good way to level 25+? @StaysafeTV  󠀀
[7:33:50] Nek0r: @iBanEvader yet it's been happening for decades
[7:33:57] iBanEvader: @Nek0r be an example, be something better
[7:34:01] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader sure and whats your point? you are just making the argument that land belongs to whoever can take it
[7:34:02] Humansoup: I agree
[7:34:08] Nek0r: @iBanEvader say that do them, not me
[7:34:09] Sal_con: How you gonna cage people and block them from the world then blame them for retaliating .....

[7:34:32] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo there should be friendly negotiations and respect
[7:34:49] Nek0r: @iBanEvader you probably don't know their end goal, you probably never read the Talmud
[7:35:16] NutterCircus: It would be cool if they made heroic modes for the previous dungeons.
[7:35:16] Avenia: why cant you just quest to start leveling?
[7:35:19] tacklenfuel: whatever guildie wants to carry my priest to max level lol
[7:35:37] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader I still dont understand your point. Israel became a nation after the ottoman empire feel and the british got administration rights. They gave the jews their ancestral homeland, legally and peacefully. Arabs couldnt accept it so they went to war

[7:43:46] letsgetgoingyo: @SsxD_ yea maybe palestine shouldve thought about that before starting a war. They did it in 1948, 1967, 1973 and 2023. Every war started by palestine. Know history

[7:45:47] Nek0r: @SsxD_ huh ? bro this thing goes back millenia
[7:45:48] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader no, children are dying because Hamas is using them as shields. Its literally their warfare tactics to maximize civilian casualties. Thats a warcrime, you know that.

[7:48:27] aidsmeister1: What's going on right now can easily exacerbate and turn into something massive. Already seen it extend out of Israel and Palestine and into Yemen

[7:50:07] aidsmeister1: I PLEDGE MEIN ALLEIGANCE TO THE JEWISH STATE
[7:50:12] aidsmeister1: I KNEW IT
[7:50:12] MC_WhiteNoiz: Trump actually helped move the lever on this event. Trump finally forced the move of the embassy from the West Bank to Jerusalem. It was avoided to keep from raising tensions.
[7:50:13] Humansoup: It's all about what the bible says Faith, Faith anf Faith
[7:50:16] aidsmeister1: I KNEW WHERE YOU WERE GOING WITH THAT
[7:50:17] Boska04: what
[7:50:20] S_Aljallaf: hahahahaha
[7:50:22] sandcakes: what
[7:50:23] S_Aljallaf: thats hillarious
[7:50:25] spookshow6: LOL
[7:50:25] causemosmvp: yes that is smart
[7:50:26] letsgetgoingyo: @Avenia this is false, this war was declared on october 7. There was previous wars in 1973, 1967, 1948 and they were all started by the Arab league.
[7:50:26] Sal_con: fuk that
[7:50:27] SupreemLeeder11: D: WTF
[7:50:32] Towenaar2: just lie EZ
[7:50:46] NeeksyGG: staysafe’s based and I’m here for it
[7:50:48] SupreemLeeder11: Madge I'd rather die in a fucking fire! 🔥
[7:50:50] MC_WhiteNoiz: @letsgetgoingyo Sounds to me like you just see all of Gaza as subhuman enemies deserving death.
[7:50:51] spookshow6: pretty cucked
[7:50:53] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo not wrong, literally go to anywehere and they will say they have been at war for 20 yeras in isreal
[7:50:53] seksmuhchine: says the japanese man
[7:50:56] Boska04: im german but i aint gonna do that
[7:50:56] letsgetgoingyo: @Avenia look in the mirror, you have zero understanding of facts and then you call me a troll. Its hilarious
[7:51:00] SsxD_: @StaysafeTV america will never leave sira3l tho because we are mostly a war country they buy from us to bomb places like palestine, its buisness
[7:51:05] causemosmvp: They can kick you out of country if you hate jews. Its safe lock
[7:51:06] Marnikx: in that context yea BUT its predates the gaza war
[7:51:09] SsxD_: isra3l*
[7:51:17] Arcsilin: i mean when these law were passed no on ehad any idea the state the world would be in currently
[7:51:22] guztawo: payo?
[7:51:25] S_Aljallaf: i follow staysafe and watch him for 1 reason only....
[7:51:32] NutterCircus: Most of it is common sense, most people are stuck in a matrix of bullshit.
[7:51:32] tacklenfuel: shame on you matt, your opinions and such
[7:51:39] Sal_con: @letsgetgoingyo thousands of israeli children havent been bombed.... most of israels casualities are warriors while palestines are little kids.... youre a monster
[7:51:50] MC_WhiteNoiz: @S_Aljallaf sstvLaika
[7:51:59] Nek0r: @SsxD_ not even mentioning the real stuff
[7:52:00] causemosmvp: The germany thing you dont understand it
[7:52:00] aidsmeister1: He's being sarcastic
[7:52:08] letsgetgoingyo: @Avenia "they will say" is not an argument. A state of war is something that is declared and draft can take place
[7:52:13] iBanEvader: @tacklenfuel he has just been playing WSG, barely in the discussion
[7:52:21] aidsmeister1: who do you think lil p supports in the Palestine Israel conflict
[7:52:28] seksmuhchine: using your name is sus
[7:52:28] glydelol: Crusader strike?
[7:52:29] tacklenfuel: very sarcastic
[7:52:29] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo you just said draft, israelis dont ahve a draft
[7:52:34] NutterCircus: I hope this shitmade thing catches on.
[7:52:38] EmanuShow: Ye lets not get uncomfortable here :D
[7:52:40] lickmypetals: @aidsmeister1 i dont think lil p even knows theres a conflict
[7:52:40] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo we have mandatory terms where we have to be in the military
[7:52:49] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo there hasnt been a single fucking draft
[7:53:21] letsgetgoingyo: @Avenia yea theres mandatory military service, that doesnt mean you are at war at all times lmao
[7:53:23] causemosmvp: The thing with allegaince to Isral is to combat muslim immigrant and nazis. You will get locked up and germany doesnt want people who hate jews in their country just because nazis ruled there.
[7:53:27] C0ld0nes: C0ld0nes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months, currently on a 68 month streak! sstvLOVE
[7:53:29] EmanuShow: We all know humans greatest achievement is to agree :P
[7:53:40] jamesQodex: Isn't it understandable that we don't want antisemits in Germany ? Almost ruined the whole continent
[7:53:48] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo israel shouldnt even exist, leage of nations fucked up :)
[7:53:48] Avenia: @letsgetgoingyo No we have that because we are in a state where we kniow we can be attacked at any point, we dont need a draft because we have people actively ready.
[7:53:49] TrueSmugg: ICANT
[7:53:53] AntarcticTreaty: @causemosmvp read what you just wrote
[7:53:56] I_eat_fried_chicken: yeah, the influx of muslims in germany clearly disproves that little theory
[7:53:56] SsxD_: sit this one out
[7:53:57] SsxD_: lmao
[7:53:58] Arcsilin: brain dead take
[7:54:00] Mr_Moffert: @causemosmvp monkaLaugh
[7:54:03] Sal_con: To pay for the sins of its past germany must be israels b!tch i guess
[7:54:14] causemosmvp: I am not native english maybe I wrote it wrong
[7:54:16] MC_WhiteNoiz: Really what we should be discussing is Netanyahu's shortcomings in letting Oct 7th happen. It actually was very much their 9/11 in which he was warned and allowed it in order to justify an all out attack. Also currently avoiding trial btw
[7:54:17] Vicente_Prime: EU waking up i see
[7:54:21] pytrsn113: where is the best spot to kill horde players? ashenvale somewhere?
[7:54:22] NutterCircus: That is like saying Americans need to swear allegiance to black people because of slavery.
[7:54:23] jamesQodex: An American brain can't really understand what is going down in Europe its not all logic
[7:54:28] Marnikx: the most american thing about u is that u have to give ur 2 cents on everything no matter what
[7:54:36] S_Aljallaf: lmao, the whole of europe will become majority muslim in like 10 years at this rate
[7:54:36] letsgetgoingyo: @Sal_con say that to the hostages still kept in hamas tunnels in gaza. Women, children and civilians. You know taking hostages is a warcrime right?
[7:54:50] MC_WhiteNoiz: @harvenius *whispers* based....
[7:54:53] Arcsilin: thats like saying all white ppl should feel back because of slavery
[7:55:01] Arcsilin: feel bad*
[7:55:04] Mr_Moffert: monkaLaugh you MUST swear allegience to the middle eastern state or you WILL be imprisoned
[7:55:04] causemosmvp: Its a safety
[7:55:07] Dracksar: @Marnikx thats liek me saying its very european to talk about americans all the time
[7:55:09] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius "israel shouldnt exist" according to who?? Allah?
[7:55:24] causemosmvp: THEY CAN
[7:55:25] QuestFor420: correct
[7:55:26] Sal_con: @letsgetgoingyo maybe if u didnt take their land and imprisoned them they wouldnt have taken hostages... and ontop of that ITS HOSTAGES they ahvent blown up little kids unlike israel they value human life unlike israel
[7:55:27] Boska04: YEP
[7:55:31] I_eat_fried_chicken: it makes no sense, thats the point KEKW
[7:55:38] fishcakexl: Nazis dont lie YEP
[7:55:40] jamesQodex: Nobody needs to swear loyalty dude why are u phrasing it like  this ?
[7:55:40] NutterCircus: If they Lie then they are spies EleGiggle
[7:55:40] Marnikx: @Dracksar americans do suck
[7:55:44] causemosmvp: It makes sense let me tell you
[7:55:48] Dracksar: @Marnikx rent free bro
[7:56:00] butterzugzug: @StaysafeTV this topic was brought up by the politician "Friedrich Merz" and has been denied by almost every politician in the government. so it's a bait to think that it's mandatory to get german citizenship
[7:56:02] I_eat_fried_chicken: xdd
[7:56:02] Koshintu: CoolStoryBob
[7:56:02] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo no, the division of palestine by the allies post ww2, they fucked up
[7:56:02] causemosmvp: The legal procedure takes 100x less time if they swore
[7:56:03] tacklenfuel: rent free is a new thing right
[7:56:10] Nek0r: @StaysafeTV you're not understanding, this is a STATE thing. Germans were taught that they were the bad guys and they have to pay. Who gets to benefit ?
[7:56:13] vejitas4: yes germany recuires that loyalty to israel because germany has a stained past, it doesnt matter
[7:56:17] letsgetgoingyo: @Sal_con they have killed little kids, in fact I have a video of it where they throw grenades into shelters and blow up several kids. You can find the video you want
[7:56:25] bboofit: is dungeon grinding or questing faster in SoiD
[7:56:27] causemosmvp: If they lied they will get kicked out of country if legal process needs to take place.
[7:56:28] vejitas4: is that simple
[7:56:30] Marnikx: @Dracksar ok, glad u on welfare i guess? cheers laddie
[7:56:34] Humansoup: sstvLOVE  I love you Homie
[7:56:35] EmanuShow: Lemmings are clever creatures i tell you :D
[7:56:50] S_Aljallaf: you cant beat them guys, face it. they own us all
[7:56:50] MC_WhiteNoiz: @letsgetgoingyo Ok good, so you're justifying Oct 7th. Glad we're on the same page.
[7:57:00] vejitas4: you dont have to beleivie it but germany
[7:57:01] Milopilo89: @ the guy in chat... iam a foreigner and i was born and life in germany. We have more foreigner then germans in our country xD so which nazis do you mean?
[7:57:06] Humansoup: But he learns from him
[7:57:07] I_eat_fried_chicken: no
[7:57:10] causemosmvp: and you people from US just parroting streamer is sad. I am living in Germany I know better.
[7:57:11] S_Aljallaf: NO
[7:57:13] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius that was done in accordance with international law. So how is that not legit? According to who?
[7:57:14] tacklenfuel: you are not responsible for it no
[7:57:16] spookshow6: literal brainrot from chat
[7:57:18] MC_WhiteNoiz: England should be responsible for America, we took the reigns.
[7:57:20] vejitas4: obviluosly not but poeple dont care about that
[7:57:32] Dracksar: @Marnikx what does well fare have to do with anything nice deflect
[7:57:33] Vicente_Prime: "YOU PEOPLE"
[7:57:36] I_eat_fried_chicken: yes, it is ridiculous
[7:57:42] vejitas4: i think like you staysafe but
[7:57:48] jamesQodex: We owe it to the great ppl that rebuild our country that we never let this happen again Germany had some dark times dude
[7:57:48] Marnikx: @Dracksar u said something about rent free
[7:57:49] vejitas4: most dont care about that
[7:57:54] drunk_hunk: good take
[7:57:55] Roninpainbringer: reparations for all the roman slaves
[7:57:55] Seoken1: we should pay reparations to people that are literally freed from modern day slavery every day. More slaves alive today than any time in history
[7:57:57] seksmuhchine: chat is always brainrot
[7:58:00] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo it's fine by international law to divide a sovereign state, or rather a colony? dunno man, sounds like cope x1000 on your part. Maybe you're too involved in this shit, you're just a debate lord online with zero impact
[7:58:03] Dracksar: @Marnikx it means you think about it all the time
[7:58:06] seksmuhchine: welcome
[7:58:07] Arcsilin: good argument TRUST ME BRO
[7:58:09] Humansoup: My great great grandfather did some shady shit I MUST pay for his SINS
[7:58:09] Boska04: @Milopilo89 this is not true
[7:58:14] aidsmeister1: sounds like he believes in german exceptionalism
[7:58:16] Marnikx: @Dracksar think about what fam?
[7:58:16] MC_WhiteNoiz: It's not guilt, we live in a class system with generational wealth. And it's something we need to recognize. If that makes you feel guilty thats on you. It's just facts not an attack on an individual.
[7:58:18] aidsmeister1: pretty dangerous stuff
[7:58:19] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius wait what sovereign state? Please clarify.
[7:58:23] Dracksar: @Marnikx americans
[7:58:24] causemosmvp: Yes but chat knwos shit and if you tell me my opinion doesnt make sense even though I work in law.. just KEKW
[7:58:29] NutterCircus: BECAUSE DansGame ROFL
[7:58:36] Boska04: 15% of germans are foreigners -  not even close to over half
[7:58:47] Humansoup: Yep
[7:58:48] Marnikx: @Dracksar sure fam
[7:59:01] cin0tv: LOL
[7:59:01] Humansoup: What is he/she doing to make it better
[7:59:03] MC_WhiteNoiz: Oh we're having 2 different conversations lol
[7:59:05] Roninpainbringer: slaves built the roman empire... all must get reparations
[7:59:12] seksmuhchine: twitch chat is not place for intellect
[7:59:15] jamesQodex: Its true that I am not guilty for what may Great Grandfather die BUT I owe to them because the rebuild this country from the dirt that we don't let this happen again its simple
[7:59:20] MC_WhiteNoiz: Nah that's my b it's your stream.
[7:59:25] MC_WhiteNoiz: <3
[7:59:38] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius what soverign state are you talking about? I think you have a very big misunderstanding here.
[7:59:41] Milopilo89: @boska04 yeah, i know... i meant ironically
[7:59:43] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo "The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, during World War I, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under the Balfour Declaration."
[7:59:48] hadeskrieg: what a bitch
[7:59:57] Koshintu: the fuck is he talkin bout
[7:59:59] Humansoup: Nope You be a good person thats all you do
[8:00:00] Arcsilin: why do YOU owe them... What?!?!
[8:00:02] aidsmeister1: just don't commit genocide
[8:00:03] aidsmeister1: not that hard
[8:00:13] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius yes you can copy paste irrelevant paragraph. I ask again, what sovereign state are you talking about?
[8:00:15] Dracksar: lol
[8:00:16] Marnikx: @Dracksar if u were triggered about what i said earlier then im sry.
[8:00:17] SsxD_: @StaysafeTV i mean its the nazi bar analogy
[8:00:17] seksmuhchine: no nope
[8:00:21] tacklenfuel: this is way to complicated for my tiny smooth neckbeard brain
[8:00:22] SsxD_: it makes a bit of sense that way
[8:00:25] NutterCircus: So have pride in your ancestors but only pride in avoiding something that happened 80 years ago...
[8:00:27] I_eat_fried_chicken: cooked logic KEKW
[8:00:28] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo Palestine
[8:00:28] Boska04: @Milopilo89 oh sry then xD i can see where ur coming from. in big citys it really does seem that way
[8:00:32] Dracksar: @Marnikx im loling cause europeans always talk about americans
[8:00:33] causemosmvp: If he has issues with it he can go somewhere else
[8:00:34] causemosmvp: it works
[8:00:36] Humansoup: SeemsGood
[8:00:38] vejitas4: is all about the image and the stained past germany has
[8:00:39] Dracksar: @Marnikx funny to me
[8:00:42] Lirrok: how is the actual question phrased though? because swearing that the Jews have a right to their own state is different than swearing to the allegiance with Israel specifically. Just saying there may be more context to it
[8:00:43] jamesQodex: Yes because a lot of Middle East ppl come to Germany and they have very bad antiseptic thinking
[8:00:44] vejitas4: is simple
[8:00:44] Marnikx: @Dracksar its just this stream mate
[8:00:46] seksmuhchine: too many tics in twitch
[8:00:49] Marnikx: @Dracksar for me atleast
[8:00:50] wes2k3: Free my boy gaza
[8:00:51] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius Palestine is a REGION, it has never been a sovereign state, ever. Or even a country.
[8:00:58] causemosmvp: @jamesQodex Antisemitic
[8:01:01] NutterCircus: Thats some twisted logic.
[8:01:04] jonisyntinen: This new generation is DOOMED ASF
[8:01:09] AntarcticTreaty: @jamesQodex antiseptic KEKW
[8:01:15] jamesQodex: @causemosmvp thank you
[8:01:16] hadeskrieg: @wes2k3 go to the front then
[8:01:20] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo why does it not read like that from a lot of resources online?
[8:01:20] MC_WhiteNoiz: I will say one thing, if another Hitler came into power, we wouldn't stop him until it was too late. There aren't really many mechanisms in place because we believe in ultimate freedom.
[8:01:23] SsxD_: @StaysafeTV have you heard of the nazi bar analogy? i think it makes a bit of logic imo
[8:01:23] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo are you a jew?
[8:01:26] aidsmeister1: based
[8:01:27] TrueSmugg: BASEDCIGAR
[8:01:29] I_eat_fried_chicken: dont try, it makes no sense and everyone who says that shit makes sense is brain dead KEKW
[8:01:30] fitrick: KEKW
[8:01:31] Mipolarization: Based
[8:01:32] Humansoup: USA USA sstvPlathy USA USA
[8:01:33] SsxD_: either way its a weird law
[8:01:38] Boska04: nah bro fk afd
[8:01:41] EmanuShow: Isnt big issue with hate in germany at the moment not hate against jews but hate against muslims?
[8:01:41] sunguyyy: member when twitch was fun and we werent all forced to be both genders
[8:01:42] AceOfFlame: Us millennials are going to fuck this world up KEKW
[8:01:47] Nek0r: yes @StaysafeTV it's pretty hard for you to understand, naturally unless you have the whole context
[8:01:55] aidsmeister1: the three germans giving you shit in chat are going to sperg now that they know that
[8:02:11] jamesQodex: BTW Germany owes al lot to the USA as well and you should be loyal to the USA as well
[8:02:13] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius because it helps the palestinian propaganda to make you believe it was a country that was taken over by jews. The reality is palestine is a region where jews built a state, from scratch, under the british mandate.
[8:02:13] causemosmvp: @StaysafeTV It would makes sense to you if you saw all the anti semitic people coming to germany just because Hitler happened
[8:02:14] jonisyntinen: LUL LUL LUL
[8:02:15] Humansoup: Nope not you
[8:02:16] nastiku: claiming right to a region of geography has only ever existed as a pretense to war
[8:02:16] MC_WhiteNoiz: World war what?
[8:02:22] NutterCircus: I dont know if Japan still blames me for WW2.
[8:02:29] pytrsn113: they dont have responsibility but i think the state germany has to pay something for that crime to keep remember what they fathers, grandfathers etc. did
[8:02:30] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo so what was before that mandate lol
[8:02:30] spookshow6: what's with this self imposed guilt trip some germans have?
[8:02:32] SsxD_: tldr: you let one nazi in, then you let two, then eventually youre in a bar full of nazis when the bar wasnt one to begin with. so letting in people who dont immediately say they respect israel is their thought process idk just the logic i see in it i think its also a bit weird of a thing to do @StaysafeTV
[8:02:33] Humansoup: Clueless
[8:02:33] I_eat_fried_chicken: wait, there was a world war? monkaHmm
[8:02:37] zoulour21: Germany gives weapons to Turkey (a Muslim country) and Turkey threaten south-east Europe with war and invades. How ironic
[8:02:43] MC_WhiteNoiz: @letsgetgoingyo People are just using Palestine and Gaza interchangeably
[8:02:45] Nek0r: Americans in general, don't know much about european history to be fair, but that's another problem
[8:02:47] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius before that was the Ottoman Empire which collapsed after WW1
[8:02:53] causemosmvp: @Nek0r this
[8:03:13] AceOfFlame: @Nek0r americans now days or really north american (including canada) dont even know their own history
[8:03:14] hadeskrieg: its naturel to fight for territory
[8:03:26] MC_WhiteNoiz: @AceOfFlame And that's by design.
[8:03:28] EmanuShow: Nah it will never end
[8:03:32] Roninpainbringer: unl;ess there are NO countires
[8:03:32] NutterCircus: We dont have to swear Allegience to Japan for nuking them.
[8:03:35] aidsmeister1: as a filthy angloid, i'm still awaiting my reparations from claudius'
[8:03:39] Milopilo89: @Boska04 Everywhere you look you only see foreigners or foreign restaurants. you can hardly understand people... the German language changes day to day. It's ok, but these Nazi stories ended long ago
[8:03:40] Roninpainbringer: NWO
[8:03:44] Nek0r: you americans have to fight this, this is important
[8:03:52] Nek0r: reform your education
[8:03:52] Dracksar: completely dishonest comment
[8:04:00] I_eat_fried_chicken: what an incredibly stupid statement KEKW
[8:04:03] SsxD_: well no one is making that noticion
[8:04:06] Nek0r: bro who said that
[8:04:06] SsxD_: notion*
[8:04:12] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo even the basic wiki article destroys your argument. guess the entire internet history is just anti jew? lol. Are you jewish?
[8:04:12] ohnoMateo: Hamas #1
[8:04:17] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius So when the Ottoman empire collapsed, the region was under British administation. This is when Jews built a state there. This became Israel. But there was no palestinian state before that. No king, no president, no soverignty. It was mostly inhospitable desert and swamp area.
[8:04:20] SsxD_: the lazi bar analogy has nothing to your conversation its just the logic process
[8:04:20] Boska04: @Milopilo89 yeah ik i live and berlin and i dont like it either
[8:04:23] causemosmvp: Thats the point though, People who are okay just dont care they will swore and not hear about israel again in their life and live happy life in Germany
[8:04:26] MC_WhiteNoiz: The same argument could be said about immigrants coming from the south border. Many of them just normal people wanting to live, not drug mules or rapist gangsters
[8:04:29] Boska04: in*
[8:04:32] Zahnstocherzimtstern: in futur Europ i see a Holocaust 2.0 just wiht muslims this time
[8:04:43] tacklenfuel: he said ingame chat >< ><
[8:04:48] I_eat_fried_chicken: dont love isreal --> nazi KEKW
[8:04:53] seksmuhchine: chat u are crazy
[8:04:57] Arcsilin: people feel bad for isreal bcause of the holocaust. and that breeds this typ of thinking
[8:05:01] causemosmvp: If he lies he will get kicked
[8:05:02] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius so what palestinian state are you talking about? Who was their president? Please, you dont understand facts you just try to read wikipedia and try to learn stuff on the fly you have no idea about.
[8:05:03] causemosmvp: EASY
[8:05:06] Quabbe: @Zahnstocherzimtstern get off the internet dude
[8:05:07] MC_WhiteNoiz: Also why would they wanna do that in Germany again? Wouldn't that be too obvious?
[8:05:10] OrganikCum: bend the knee to prove you aren't hiding nazis in your attic
[8:05:11] I_eat_fried_chicken: 100%
[8:05:14] TrueSmugg: @causemosmvp how do you know they're lying?
[8:05:15] Arcsilin: ^
[8:05:17] Boska04: true

[8:05:49] causemosmvp: @TrueSmugg ITS LEGAL TRICK. IF YOU LIE, YOU GET INTO legal process and they will kick you, they have legal grounds
[8:05:55] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo you understand territory was allocated to "jews" that were displaced, pushing out arabs. Israel is a state made up of nomads, the brits fucked everything (as usual)
[8:05:57] wes2k3: Having German citizens support a different genocide is ironic
[8:05:59] causemosmvp: bcs you swore to israel

[8:07:28] TrueSmugg: there it is
[8:07:28] Sal_con: bro hes a sperg
[8:07:29] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius Bro, stop. The British got the territory called palestine after WW1 and it was divided into two - Palestine for the jews and Transjordan for the arabs. Arabs wanted it all and so they rejected it and declared war on israel trying to wipe out the jews.
[8:07:33] VinoHuncho: what are you prepping for p2?

[8:08:06] EmanuShow: Communism is making a comeback :p
[8:08:09] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo based on the original demographic, it wasnt the brits land to divide to the displaced jews. That's the issue we have. Colonialism is shit
[8:08:09] Milopilo89: @Boska04 Dann weißt du ja was ich meine... ich komme aus Hannover und du weißt wie es in Berlin ^^ und Frankfurt ist noch schlimmer. Gefühlt sieht man keine detuschen mehr auf der straße zumindest in den groß städten und wie sehr sehne ich mich nach einem guten deutschem restaurant. DE ist halt der mittlepunkt europas wo alle aufeinander treffen.
[8:08:17] jonisyntinen: @causemosmvp LUL
[8:08:25] causemosmvp: Then open internet and learn about it xd
[8:08:36] SsxD_: @letsgetgoingyo so you support imperialism and think just because the brits gave some land to isra3l its theirs? like the people living their dont have a right to it as well lmao
[8:08:39] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius if colonialism is shit, then why is your beef not with the Ottoman empire who colonized the area first?? LUL
[8:08:43] NutterCircus: The massive guilt trip they gave those kids... NotLikeThis
[8:08:44] jonisyntinen: Interney what is that
[8:08:49] Boska04: @Milopilo89 ja echt traurig falls ich irgendwann kinder hab zieh ich aufs land xD
[8:08:55] fitrick: @causemosmvp i dont care about what youre saying, tell me how youd feel if you didnt eat breakfast
[8:08:56] MC_WhiteNoiz: @letsgetgoingyo So you admit the Jews came onto the land not vice versa. Yet it was the original settlers responding that are the aggressors?
[8:09:01] letsgetgoingyo: @SsxD_ The ottomans colonized the area but lost control after WW1
[8:09:07] tacklenfuel: i thought it was we beat up on zionism what happened
[8:09:22] Vicente_Prime: I'll never be enough @StaysafeTV

[8:09:35] letsgetgoingyo: @MC_WhiteNoiz Nope, there were jews there and arabs there since forever. They were all called Palestinians, because they inhabited the region called palestine. There was no country there
[8:09:40] Vicente_Prime: DUOLINGO?
[8:09:40] Qworalmarker: Damn chat, y'all still giving this fool the attention they're looking for? Stop letting them live in yo head rent free

[8:10:56] Nek0r: @StaysafeTV but USA has been funding it since its creation
[8:10:57] Roninpainbringer: THE ONLY GRP THAT HASNT BEEN COLONIZE IS THE GRP OF STONE AGE PEOPLE LIVING ON THAT ISLAND OF INDIAN COAST LOL
[8:11:04] jamesQodex: America needs friends to
[8:11:09] letsgetgoingyo: @SsxD_ but its not the arabs land. Arabs are colonizers in the levant, you know this right? arabs come from the arab peninsula and they COLONIZED the entire middle east. Jews are NATIVE to the levant.
[8:11:17] bennybe: you dont care kids getting bombed to pieces?
[8:11:17] Nek0r: you should @StaysafeTV

[8:12:45] AceOfFlame: @AceOfFlame there could very well be oil on moons
[8:12:50] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius what I dont understand is that you hate colonialism, but arabs are only there because they were the most aggressive colonizers in the middle east. They literally came there through IMPERIALISM (ottoman EMPIRE). So your argument makes no sense.
[8:12:51] Roninpainbringer: but when the jews do... OHHH LAWD
[8:12:51] SsxD_: well you can say stop sticking ur hand in the cookie jar but the politicians are fat and want cookies @StaysafeTV
[8:13:04] Arcsilin: but lets spend billions on war YES
[8:13:12] harvenius: @letsgetgoingyo thats fair

[8:14:53] tacklenfuel: alot of usa hate, rent free :D
[8:14:58] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius and Romans colonized before them, so did the byzantines and so on. The region has changed hands under different empires for millenia. But Jews are actually native there. Kingdom of Israel 3000 years ago. They are native, and dig anywhere in the ground in palestine and you find jewish artifacts, coins, temples, mosaics, etc. So you could say that Israel is actually a de-colonization movement.
[8:14:59] Vicente_Prime: @MC_WhiteNoiz bruh hahaha KEKW
[8:15:09] Sal_con: Apprently myanmar is in a big war right now.. im surprised america isnt involved

[8:15:24] SsxD_: @StaysafeTV if you want america to focus on america you should advocate for less military funding and we should redistribute that to the people and social programs to better our country and fix infastructures. schooling, etc
[8:15:29] MC_WhiteNoiz: You were saying that you care more about americans than israelies, but americans are israelies and palestinians, america is everyone. But it didn't really work because you're referring to people living in that country

[8:17:04] schyrro: good morning from eu, do you take hot or cold showers?
[8:17:06] letsgetgoingyo: @harvenius in a way yes. The jews were also unhappy with the way that the British administered the territory. So it was a Jew vs Arab land dispute that the British had to solve. It ended with them making a deal that jews accepted and arabs rejected, even though it was really bad deal for the jews. Thats the day israel became sovereign.
[8:17:06] MC_WhiteNoiz: Back then everyone had a boner for it. We are still recovering from the anti middle eastern sentiment

[8:35:19] enok92: chat be debating in chat, take it in dm's, this not the place
[8:35:19] letsgetgoingyo: @SsxD_ America won independence by winning a war. Israel also won independence by winnig a war. Thats what happens when you win a war.
[8:35:20] Crunchynuts: Would banning circumcision in the US be unconstitutional?

[8:36:30] harvenius: its genital mutilation of children, we need to say it how it is
[8:36:40] doloriferous: ?????
[8:36:42] letsgetgoingyo: @SsxD_ Jews are also palestinians. Before 1948 there were arab palestinians and jewish palestinians. So if you think the land belongs to palestinians, that includes jews.
[8:36:45] Tobssessxic: D:

[8:37:20] aidsmeister1: still insane to me that somehow circumcision became popular in the US
[8:37:20] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo oh so you want to talk about Israel's class system now ?
[8:37:20] Pinguin012: Moin

[8:39:24] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r considering you don't know the facts of Israels founding, I dont think it makes sense to discuss other aspects of israel with you. Read up on facts, then im happy to discuss, instead of lecture on the stuff you dont know.
[8:39:26] Humansoup: True *

[8:41:04] bryggx: Getting the black beetle mount must have felt pretty good too?

[8:56:54] akswow: @Adubington  monkaLaugh
[8:56:54] Sheldorisafk: my aunt and uncle had 11 kids.
[8:56:54] EmanuShow: My father and mother come from two different etnicities originated in sweden if i ever marry again and get children i would probably want a wife besides "White" etnicity
[8:57:09] Manxkaffee: My gf cant imagine liking the process

[8:57:23] Lirrok: KEKW
[8:57:33] theboosh7: They had a good run
[8:57:39] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r so answer the question my dude. Does USA have a right to exist? If no, then why. If yes, then why. Your answer will explain a lot about your political beliefs
[8:57:41] Arcsilin: u dont until it happens
[8:57:43] Cuddiloo: I have 3 daugthers and we want them to have own rooms, and had to build a new room for me and wifey in the basement. So my setup is beneath the stairs in the basement. Kids is everything
[8:57:49] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo I'm gonna play the same game for you, do you think Mauritania has a right to exist ?
[8:57:53] Arcsilin: how can you know whitout doing
[8:58:08] seksmuhchine: maybe they just want 1 million at 3percent
[8:58:23] bryggx: Childbirth scares the shit out of me. It's so brutal
[8:58:27] Manxkaffee: I can imagine it is wild, though obviously no idea how it feels in the moment
[8:58:35] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r This is non-answer. I dont know anything about mauritania, so I couldnt tell you. However still waiting for your response. Does USA have a right to exist yes or no?
[8:58:38] Synmachus: Learned the mechanics EZ
[8:58:39] TobbishG: waiting for my fist kid that will be born i juli! Cant wait! :D

[8:58:53] Humansoup: The WORLD doesnt need Everyones DNA thats for sure
[8:59:14] seksmuhchine: no
[8:59:18] saund: thats why i let my wife and 5 kids live in the house and i live in the shed with the dog

[8:59:45] saund: @PanTomto9 specsavers angle my friend
[8:59:50] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r You want to say no, but that would reveal you are a leftist. If you say yes, then your argument against israel crumbles. This is why you do not want to answer KEKW
[9:00:04] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo oh so you don't know anything about Mauritania that's cute... and what makes you believe that by answering that question will tell you all of my "core" beliefs, in which you just changed it to "political" beliefs ?
[9:00:21] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo you're digging yourself man
[9:00:30] don_ben_yo: True

[9:00:56] JermOW: what do u sacrafice?
[9:01:03] isaacsFPS: just being a real human, in super terms
[9:01:03] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r youre dodging the question. Does USA have a right to exist?? Just say what you believe. Im not saying your answer is right or wrong, but it tells me your philosophical lens.
[9:01:11] saund: sacrifice is the biggest action of love, Jesus taught us that
[9:01:23] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo we need to learn from history and be better
[9:01:23] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo you're so into propaganda that you think it's just one side vs another, total polarization ?
[9:01:25] plsnojebait: >sod phase 2 prep >wsg solo queue hell
[9:01:31] seksmuhchine: horizontal is easier
[9:01:34] akswow: the 2 guys spam tagging each other, couldn't you just DM each other?
[9:01:43] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader do you think USA has a right to exist then?
[9:01:49] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo dude you're fucking dumb I already gave you the answer
[9:02:00] SimonHalfSoul: You don't live hedonistically right?? Don't you dare @StaysafeTV
[9:02:07] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r You did not. What is your answer?
[9:02:08] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo you're talking about native americans right?
[9:02:17] AmarokUnchained: holy shit, the repgrind is real but is it worth
[9:02:20] Nek0r: @letsgetgoingyo but since you can't use your brains because you don't know any better, I feel sorry for you
[9:02:20] JermOW: maybe sacrafice some classic WoW....for the kids.
[9:02:23] AmarokUnchained: agree
[9:02:26] ChillyHTX: shouldnt that be the norm
[9:02:36] Ropy123: @JermOW or teach them WoW to farm gold for you Kappa
[9:02:48] boyhasheart: I dedicated my life to raising good chickens
[9:03:05] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader not specifically. I am talking about supposed land ownership. Does USA as a country have a right to exist?
[9:03:06] Barewood: do u think u could farm for humberts helm solo as a metamorphis lock? @staysafetv
[9:03:12] Koshintu: btw whoever told me to watch that christian preacher atheist shit

[9:03:24] JermOW: nothing says sacraficing for the family like 2 months of 10 hour WoW streams
[9:03:29] seksmuhchine: welp
[9:03:32] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo your argument is horrible because as human species we need to try to learn out of our past mistakes and be better. The native american genocide, the jews from WW2 are all bad. So is the war in Palestine now.
[9:03:40] Manxkaffee: I think you can have a great influence in the world by dedicating yourself to any person or community (conditions apply)
[9:03:45] basone: @JermOW job?
[9:03:49] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo we can't change what happened in the past but we can change our trajectory now
[9:03:50] AmarokUnchained: oh, a sillybilly

[9:04:08] AceOfFlame: by playing wow and defeating the opposing faction!
[9:04:09] plsnojebait: that is a nice thought. but i grew up with plenty of people whose parents gave them the world and they ended up dying on opiates
[9:04:10] wookieenthal: LUL
[9:04:15] Nek0r: remember guys, your political and "core" beliefs all comes down to "do you think the USA has the right to exist?" holy shit
[9:04:21] plsnojebait: other than some fringe cases, the more of a safety net someone had the worse they turned out

[9:05:14] Piorum_: @Nek0r if you say no you are just a leftist sorry
[9:05:23] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo yes the USA has a right to exist, wtf is your point
[9:05:25] Denz0TV: Solution: don't have kids

[9:09:11] pgm128: Can we all agree "read the room" is already reached the point of over used?
[9:09:15] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo what the USA did to the native americans is horrible and we should learn from those mistakes
[9:09:20] tacklenfuel: respect the stream bitches

[9:09:50] Piorum_: @basedschizo44 It's been an honor o7 goodbye
[9:09:52] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader sure, but that happened 400 years ago. But the USA still has a right to exist as a function of their conquest. Correct?
[9:09:58] vejitas4: what time is it over there wher you live @StaysafeTV
[9:10:03] Adubington: maximum nuts

[9:10:19] akswow: Hi, I've been a garbage collector for about 20 years of my life until I finally got retired. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I'd get to watch so much trash ever again until I started watching your warlock wsg gameplay. Thanks dude. This is pure nostalgia.
[9:10:30] tacklenfuel: her tummy might hurt
[9:10:33] bazzzzzzz: i mean you need to be in deep waters to be pro palestine
[9:10:38] wookieenthal: holy shit

[9:10:46] harvenius: @akswow lmao
[9:10:48] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo dude Europe has been having wars for millenia and we live in peace now, grow the fuck up. Israel is commiting war crimes and a genocide.
[9:11:03] letsgetgoingyo: @Nek0r im examining your philophical framework as it pertains to land ownership. So if USA has a right to exist, according to the same principles, Israel does as well
[9:11:06] Humansoup: Thank you
[9:11:14] Lirrok: thats the most fair stance
[9:11:14] tacklenfuel: anti hate
[9:11:14] Synmachus: @akswow Cringe
[9:11:15] Koshintu: BUT MR STREAMER YOU MUST CHOOSE A SIDE Madge
[9:11:20] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo what happened in the past is the past. We need to see at what is happening now and build a better future
[9:11:24] AceOfFlame: I dont even get why US is even wanting to help israel
[9:11:25] JermOW: yeah they should
[9:11:28] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo Israel is demolishing the future
[9:11:30] Humansoup: God will take care of them
[9:11:32] Nek0r: @iBanEvader he thinks he's talking to some random dudes who don't know anything at all
[9:11:38] EmanuShow: God bless the world the americans are going home^^
[9:11:39] stankypanky22: what if israel starts to take over the entire middle east?
[9:11:41] davemkii: Yeah, the US have been the world police for too long. It's not America's responsibility to keep everyone in line. But saying that, I'd trust Israel more than I'd trust Palestine
[9:11:44] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader Yes exactly. Israels founding is in the past. Happened almost a century ago now.
[9:11:58] Humansoup: Good
[9:11:59] iBanEvader: @Nek0r yea he's so stupid
[9:12:00] freelootenthousiast: good
[9:12:01] bazzzzzzz: @stankypanky22 lol come on :D
[9:12:05] EmanuShow: All complaints will go from f u usa to why arent you doing anything :P
[9:12:11] Humansoup: nope
[9:12:25] Arcsilin: that would just be the usa taking over the middle east so
[9:12:30] BeerBeefandFries: people are so paranoid about isreal being this crazy super entity behind the scenes

[9:14:21] letsgetgoingyo: @iBanEvader this is not a correct categorization of events. Palestine invaded Israel on october 7 and committed a massacre. So there is a war now where Palestinians are the aggressors.

[9:15:27] iBanEvader: @letsgetgoingyo Hamas, a terrorist organisation which was created by israel in the first place did this. It was up to Israel to control Palestine. Israel has secret agencies and is basically a world power. They could've prevented this attack but they didn't to provoke a war.

[9:21:03] Nek0r: Europe cares about the world yes, and so does the USA as in the governments. The reason why I think the people doesn't care is because they don't really care and don't view the world as a whole, as Europeans generally do

[9:27:01] bazzzzzzz: @letsgetgoingyo imo. a lot of people can't comprehend that one side is a straight out terror organisation, supporting palestine and being anti-israel is straight out pro-terror. You don't have to agree with Israel, but understanding that Hamas is a REAL-threat that doesn't just cease to exist. I mean come on, for them real-life is just like wow, they can't wait to level up and join after life.

I've been to the US for months and they're more european that they like to admit. Most of the immigrants that formed the country are all from Euro heritage. Now tell me why there's media saying this is a bad thing ? That's where the real problem lies, fucking stupid agendas to divide us all even more
[9:31:02] plebTV: bro ur trippin @StaysafeTV they are preparing for ww3
[9:31:07] plebTV: and need bodies
[9:31:12] I_eat_fried_chicken: but they're not working and paying taxes KEKW
[9:31:16] bikersrocha: So you abstain your responsible society to have kids by importing from irresponsible and violent societies who have without limits
[9:31:29] EmanuShow: Swedish politicians kinda was hoping immigrants would work in eldercare and so on but that kinda didnt happen much
[9:31:31] Koshintu: theres some country that did that
[9:31:36] plebTV: bro
[9:31:39] Humansoup: Drink Less and Don't look so blonde and hot
[9:31:43] Manxkaffee: EU countries already do that, not enough.
[9:31:44] Humansoup: Idk
[9:31:46] h2h_nillz: they do that already with getting your taxes back every year
[9:31:53] plebTV: read what i said and stop autistically talking @StaysafeTV KEKW
[9:32:14] MrMyller: yeah!
[9:32:17] Nek0r: yes

[9:32:30] basic94: depends how many intergrate i'd say
[9:32:31] ScarfaceCEO: I would also add this is an intended goal.
[9:32:32] pappej: Shrinking population is fine. The imported "workers" is a net cost for the state so that doesn't actually makes as much sense as one might think
[9:32:35] freelootenthousiast: 100 fucking percent agree, im living it right now, small western european country that feels like a different world compared to 20 yrs ago
[9:32:37] letsgetgoingyo: yes and people have to assimilate to the national culture or leave.
[9:32:38] Nero_RME: I've watched it happen with no brakes on for 20 years
[9:32:41] MrMyller: then you have Sweden today ;)
[9:32:45] bikersrocha: and the only way to keep the power, is to establish a dictatorship of the old native people
[9:32:49] Humansoup: 100%
[9:32:58] Arawnik: welcome to sweden today :) exactly that
[9:33:01] bazzzzzzz: Yes it's gonna be controlled by sharia :D

[9:33:06] Humansoup: But at waht cost yep
[9:33:12] Nek0r: @StaysafeTV even Angel Merkel said "multiculturalism" has failed in Europe
[9:33:14] Humansoup: what *
[9:33:15] freelootenthousiast: @Arawnik france, belgium , germany, netherlands etc etc, its gone too far
[9:33:25] bots_bots: whats the bad part that immigrants bring with them?
[9:33:27] Humansoup: Nope
[9:33:34] Manxkaffee: 1,5 minute ad in the middle of an interesting argument, thanks twitch

[9:33:44] letsgetgoingyo: the globalists treat nations like an economic zone. But a nation is so much more. its culture, history, customs, traditions and heritage, language, social bonds and so on
[9:33:45] EmanuShow: Nah they told they needed that to keep population situation stable but immigrants kinda dont contribute much
[9:33:50] VolfuryRex: And thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

[9:34:36] bikersrocha: @bots_bots violence and wrong doing. I'm from a 3rd world countries, not everyone understands respect their hosts
[9:34:39] letsgetgoingyo: @crazychiuaua a fish that cant detect water its living in
[9:34:40] RumpleForeskinMD: Lol America runs culture

[9:52:29] Denz0TV: I'm half japanese half german living in America. Love all cultures but probably German the most
[9:52:38] Mipolarization: @RudyRube Nah. Japan is pretty based.

[9:55:20] carlos_the_7th: Unrelated to the topic -- did you enjoy warlock tanking at all?
[9:55:21] RudyRube: @basedschizo44 diversity can yield value, diversity itself is not a value though, and does not always yield value.
[9:55:25] arcturion_kthx: Tyrant wasn’t necessarily a bad word in ancient Greece
[9:55:25] Manxkaffee: True, but totalitarian governments rise and fall with their leader.

[9:55:42] Crunchynuts: Doesn't totalitarianism eliminate any form of a fail safe or chance for change in the future?
[9:55:47] RudyRube: @basedschizo44 german/british white american
[9:56:00] Mipolarization: @RudyRube The problem is, those few percent doesn't stay a few percent. And we see that in a whole lot of other countries these days. So no, I disagree with you wholeheartedly.
[9:56:10] badassboots76: @Manxkaffee with the help of an outside force, such is the case with Iraq and Saddam
[9:56:30] pappej: Rome lasted pretty long
[9:56:35] smabert19: How many honorable kills do you need to get a pvp rank?
[9:56:49] Boska04: they just groom their new leader
[9:56:59] bikersrocha: @Crunchynuts Totalitarian States are regimes that suppress individuals
[9:57:01] Nek0r: all hail the great roman empire
[9:57:13] tommynt111: How was Rome a good country for majority of people?
[9:57:23] Manxkaffee: Yeah, but when Rome had a bad leader, they tended to have a bad time. If they had good leaders (5 good emperors) they were blasting
