[8:52:13] ManBats: WotLK poppin for a couple months and at patch/content releases
[8:52:34] LegoCoin: yeah classic releases will remain niche with similar spiked interest for content launches. lots of games having similar hype spikes and pull backs
[8:52:36] Treesy__: No LFD in wrath means it will eventually die like other Classic realms
[8:53:07] ManBats: LFD?
[8:53:19] unebeast: it's funny because people have been doing original naxx a little under a year ago. now doing it again  lol
