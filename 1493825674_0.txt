[2:12:51] TTVDocSnipe: @eskimoalex It takes thousands of dollars to get 5* gems
[2:12:53] roninjake: @bjop is it just to be useable via mobile?
[2:12:53] akashij_: Is this game 4 life free ?

[2:14:08] machriphi: @MastaDebator Probably a limitation of being a mobile game, can't have too much rendered on screen.
[2:14:10] ControlWarrior: buying battle pass and 3-4$ things is the way to go . behind it just grind u dont even need max gems to be fine
[2:14:10] imMartinho: you can just do 100 elder rifts between the 2 and that should be about 10k mobs
[2:14:11] lateknighthero: dollars only
[2:14:15] zamburg: can you give honest opinion despite #ad?

[2:15:25] supurnovaa: the UI scale and everything is very much a mobile game from seeing this stream :\
[2:15:31] inquisitorgm: Corpse lance was op in D3
[2:15:39] nick_um_yeah: game is so fun just wish the pc port was a bit better
[2:15:39] Nymuelovan: @shroud thought the same you are thinking but corpse explosion is better @shroud
[2:15:47] DarkColossus51: Cool
[2:15:47] machriphi: @supurnovaa Well, that's because this is a mobile game.

[2:16:23] Heiizzenn: true
[2:16:25] ToastarN: I had way lower expectations tbh
[2:16:26] edrafael: @shroud give us a short resume of this game in 15 words or less!
[2:16:26] Draekeun: Most of the hate is "bad because on phone" it's not bad it's fine
[2:16:28] anjyel: SeemsGood
[2:16:28] clicknoize: true
[2:16:29] Draccon77: less monetization would've been nice tho @shroud
[2:16:29] pperik: best phone game maybe
[2:16:32] Palantarian: It's the pay to win that kills it for people @shroud
[2:16:36] yajiko07: genshin impact tho
[2:16:37] microbio16: how do i upgrade my combat rating in this game, im new to diablo?
[2:16:42] ChanceDanZ: This is p2w ??? shit
[2:16:45] marshallxdx7: This is amazing for a phone game, 10 years ago I would’ve never expected mobile gaming to be like this
[2:16:48] tidykangaroo: its just about the p2w yeah everything else besides that is pretty good imo
[2:16:52] alexdahitman: @shroud can you zoom out at all?

[2:17:08] Midblade: Ive yet to have to pay anything
[2:17:10] ToastarN: It's actually pretty fun, but PC needs a lot of improvements. And there is no doubt it's super p2w but still fun
[2:17:10] Nymuelovan: @yajiko07 best game. shame the p2w aspect
[2:17:13] justifymyluck: I played D1 not playing D2 or D3 would I enjoy this ?
[2:17:14] squidgamepog: @x_mistik_x yup
[2:17:14] Thirty7Cannons: @chancedanz yeah, admin covered that this game requires $50k for full top notch gear
[2:17:14] Zentauror: Chat is always talking about p2w, is the lategame p2w? I'm level 46 and havent seen any p2w yet
[2:17:15] HappyCycling_: DESPAIR
[2:17:17] pooge32: !Rustsens
[2:17:17] kixxxx999: BibleThump
[2:17:20] flashnickgg: genshin monkaHmm
[2:17:24] Heiizzenn: if they were a little easy on p2w mechanics, i think most people would be fine. It's a great game if you want to be casual and not spend anything
[2:17:27] Palantarian: @Palantarian Yes, but the advantage paying makes a big difference in the end
[2:17:28] Midblade: for real
[2:17:31] clicknoize: @Zentauror same lvl 3 here

[2:18:09] srjian: Jesus Crist this guy Voice is deep AF
[2:18:09] ToastarN: @Zentauror to lvl up your gems etc you have to or spend years playing to get the same
[2:18:16] Voljere: its the model that makes the most. Companies not going public can fix that.
[2:18:17] Lee859: has shroud spent any money yet?
[2:18:19] IHBCI: just dont be poor 4Head
[2:18:20] HeimgangTR: Asmongold payed 350 dollars in the first 4 hours of this game
[2:18:20] rmsprowler: does shroud play games on computer or pc?
[2:18:21] HIGHTV: Eve's pay structuring made me realize how gaming is going
[2:18:27] tarduq: does shroud play rust... youd probably be good at it if you were good at csgo
[2:18:27] illastration1: I'll never play a pay to win game
[2:18:28] Pekter: here it comes!!
[2:18:30] Pengy_Plays_: @pautrij delLol
[2:18:30] kyrenee666: Lost ark isnt even ts just pay 2 process faster. you arent winning anything
[2:18:34] machriphi: @rmsprowler Yes
[2:18:41] BambiOnCrackk: Pretty much All Asian games, that doesnt happen that much in USA / EU games. NODDERS
[2:18:42] kromkrush: it wouldnt be p2w at all if gear didnt impact pvp but thats half the game
[2:18:50] KinkyMarieGIFs: "ew p2w"  *goes and pays for D3*
[2:18:51] RerQ: @illastration1 why not?
[2:19:01] Ronin33: the balance is not in this game, they knew the game would be good, and then went nuts with pay2 win, you need to spend thousands endgame for the upgraded upgraded gems, its been mathed out
[2:19:01] FR4NCO: @nick_um_yeah  pretty sure its been broken down and it would take like 200+ years of game time if u play for free.
[2:19:01] ChubbyMikey: the thing about the p2w aspects is that people don't like itdon't pay for any of it, and people that irrationaly hate don't even get the game. so who cares?
[2:19:03] xYarndyy: is this another copy and paste game with just some more added unlocks?
[2:19:03] kupothemoog: I absolutely hate the auto navigation in mobile rpgs, but I understand its purpose
[2:19:09] Dawtx: Lost Ark is just an asian grindfest. I dunno why all those games are just unfun
[2:19:10] xinroc: pvp in this game is payer vs payer
[2:19:11] illastration1: @RerQ competitive integrity matters
[2:19:14] tryingtolearnthis: I got some enchanted dust you can buy
[2:19:17] RerQ: @illastration1 doesn't though
[2:19:29] xeref666: its 425
[2:19:30] ControlWarrior: @FR4NCO  totally fair 200 years is ok with future tech people will be alive Kappa
[2:19:31] Pengy_Plays_: @chubbymikey yeah well said pretty much sums it up delLol
[2:19:33] Gradyolson1: !server

[2:19:48] klutsiii: is this game actually decent? or just worthless phone junk
[2:19:51] kupothemoog: @Dawtx Thats what rpgs are, a grindfest asian or not
[2:19:55] thesmugller: #DiabloPartner
[2:19:56] zamburg: @Dawtx bruh you have never played lost ark if you think its a grindfest
[2:19:57] Pekter: FR4NCO we cant judge if they have the time to not work and F2P the game tho
[2:20:01] anjyel: lilnoodzAHH
[2:20:02] EnderKilgannon: @ChubbyMikey IMO if there is no, actual PVP and you don't care about ladders, then p2w is fine, its a good mobile game, haven't played on pc yet

[2:20:09] TRIHARD_FROM_CHINA_: chat remember, there is a limit between microtransaction and greedy p2w. I think genshin gave a great exmaple of a mild microtranscation.

[2:20:14] Heiizzenn: @ChubbyMikey i think it's the frustration that people won't be getting it at the end. Most people wouldn't even reach that point but it still pisses them off
[2:20:14] shubhmax23: for some reason i now have 109.7k channel points XD
[2:20:21] ControlWarrior: PogChamp did they sent you level 5 gem ?

[2:20:23] Pengy_Plays_: @zamburg I just stopped playing lost ark because it was boring

[2:40:50] Pengy_Plays_: @henr1p cutthroat.... delLol delLol delLol
[2:40:56] Keloku: Some people in chat are so clueless and bias. At this point in the game there is not really any P2W, the gems are a stat multiplier and you don't get a lot of stats until end game. Like you could spend $100k at lvl 30 but your only going to do like 5% more damage than other lvl 30's. End game PvP might be p2w, but not this lol
[2:41:00] TheDudeARides: This is awesome!
[2:41:05] darkterror996: @ictionfps the story and dungeons don't take that much of a hit from p2w but PvP does so it depends on you

[2:52:18] YoteWorld: Wtf is this
[2:52:23] masakari333: this game has some interesting cash shop options Kappa

[2:52:49] iwanttostudy: is this game free
[2:52:50] ChubbyMikey: @PsyNytes I've been maining my 8008 button
[2:52:50] pokadot45: you should host @lunatical_king
[2:52:55] Fulosophy: @iwanttostudy Yes
[2:52:56] Pekter: m0dsarebugs thats why its like it is, so everyone see
[2:52:58] PsyNytes: @ChubbyMikey And 10m. Up that to 1h
[2:53:00] hey_im_robby: A 5 star is a .02% chance.
[2:53:01] lain_jpeg: what do you think about it so far
[2:53:10] littlesack: who is rich and how come everyone keeps talking about how much money he spends on this game?
[2:53:11] SeffaHD: how much dollars have we spend so far?
[2:53:13] StaticZapper: surely there are no seasonal wipes right since it's so p2w right?
[2:53:15] troywidna: p2w suxks
[2:53:18] Spens_: what the fah
[2:53:23] sirpoopalot420: @chompas11 might as well play hearthstone
[2:53:24] Avarit: Hey Kate shroudHi
[2:53:24] ValzFromCanada: so its D3 mobile gacha edition?
[2:53:27] Pekter: littlesack number 1 in his server
[2:53:27] masakari333: this game made me reinstall d2r
[2:53:29] Brandon_Trolik: @littlesack he gets his community to send him money to upgrade his characters, he does it on all games
[2:53:34] StraightOuttaLisbon: Game is free COPIUM
[2:53:34] PsyNytes: Heya @Avarit shroudLove
[2:53:34] RRRegi: @ValzFromCanada, no gacha.
[2:53:35] ChubbyMikey: one hour minimum for all infractions. Got it
[2:53:38] LaparaJoe: money should be for just skins and exp boosts
[2:53:40] masakari333: it's a massive grand for gems even with paying
[2:53:40] jaydydisturbed: bp xp
[2:53:42] daklost: You can get the currency to buy those buy doing empty elder rifts.
[2:53:42] din_812: Kappa you can just buy them from AH
[2:53:43] not_tiramisu: hi Shroud
[2:53:44] kingmoul: yo chat will there be a reset after open beta?
[2:53:46] PsyNytes: @ChubbyMikey NODDERS
[2:53:48] chompas11: @chubbymikey yikes
[2:53:51] marinesniper412: marinesniper412 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:53:51] supchc: is that chad?
[2:53:53] Keloku: @sirpoopalot420 Legit for PvE $0 is fine to do everything in the game. You will hardly notice a difference until Hell 2 (goes up to hell 4?) Then paying is helpful, but still not needed. If you want to rank 1 leaderboard pvp, its $100k to max a character on average. But like $50k of that gives you 1% damage reduction, no one would do that.
[2:53:55] iwanttostudy: can we play it on pc ?
[2:53:57] Pekter: kingmoul no
[2:53:57] redcloud772: @Spens_ fa is a rune i think
[2:53:57] Deathsshadow254: lol no
[2:53:58] ChubbyMikey: @chompas11 :)

[2:54:04] Deathsshadow254: not even close
[2:54:05] yuen_sama: is this a mobile game?
[2:54:05] PsyNytes: Yup @iwanttostudy
[2:54:05] Civtac: @kingmoul its full release. only pc client is beta'
[2:54:07] m0dsarebugs: they did the math, to max out legendary armor to max without paying takes like 12 years or daily play or something lol
[2:54:07] kingmoul: @Pekter thanks fam
[2:54:09] FR4NCO: way worse
[2:54:10] miriones: game will die in a month
[2:54:11] PsyNytes: @yuen_sama It's both mobile and pc
[2:54:12] masakari333: to get past the wall
[2:54:14] supchc: whered chad go

[2:54:16] unique_protege: how do you have 20 bounties? I only get 8 per day, wtf
[2:54:20] supchc: wheres j9
[2:54:20] iwanttostudy: @PsyNytes thank you
[2:54:20] hey_im_robby: Yeah, is similar in business model, but the depth is much worse.
[2:54:21] yuen_sama: @PsyNytes Oh thanjk you.
[2:54:25] Aymen_bdj: Kappa

[2:54:33] marinesniper412: love you shroud
[2:54:34] Ishrn: "luck" = money
[2:54:35] masakari333: all mobile games pretty much follow this model
[2:54:38] din_812: I think this game is way worse
[2:54:42] jae_yugen: poe is pretty good with that tho
[2:54:48] Brandon_Trolik: @littlesack yeah just search rich
[2:54:50] Mr_anabol: pengar
[2:54:50] lain_jpeg: there will never be a good mmo ever again
[2:54:51] RRRegi: @Ishrn, you really closed your ears when he said that sentence KEKW
[2:54:52] vettie69: But you dont need to spend money to enjoy the game
[2:54:53] Desano1: there are lots of free games with far less predatory systems
[2:54:54] yozTHECAT: ??
[2:54:54] Atrophex: because they will make wayyyy less
[2:54:56] supchc: ???
[2:54:59] chompas11: seems like this is much more harsh than lost ark with the power difficulty spike
[2:55:02] Pengy_Plays_: @szexall rip mate
[2:55:05] snowdropxo: mobile gamers have no standards
[2:55:06] backdoorbufet: people need to be able to get into it to know its addictive
[2:55:06] Pekter: because F2P are the product for the whales
[2:55:06] yuen_sama: in purchase >>>>> subscription/one time payment of game
[2:55:06] hunchovsky: nobody buys mobile games
[2:55:08] HorseBanker: nobody buys non-free mobile games
[2:55:09] iwanttostudy: NO i am poor let them be free :(
[2:55:10] blackjay111: making way to much off microtransactions vs the base price
[2:55:14] Spectorsj: they make this p2w because they know we will accept it and its proven to make them more money
[2:55:14] ChoseSimba: 1% of players pay for 99% of the game thats why
[2:55:18] Heiizzenn: mobile players are insane money spenders
[2:55:21] AntoineLeftFoot: subscription model ftw please
[2:55:22] RRRegi: @Desano1, nothing as polished as this
[2:55:24] Avarit: I mean the revenue for games like genshin impact shows people are willing to spend
[2:55:26] Mvdin: Cause they need many players for ppl to spend
[2:55:27] yuen_sama: @heizzzzen true

[2:55:40] Aymen_bdj: i never thaught gamers think like this its a Sadge world we live in
[2:55:45] ShamanasS: this is tablet game ?
[2:55:46] marinesniper412: interesting
[2:55:54] Desano1: LoL has a great bussiness model imo and is also free
[2:55:54] chompas11: @aymen_bdj agreed
[2:55:57] Keloku: @StonedDruids android, IOS and PC, so yes.
[2:55:57] FR4NCO: F2P is like a slot machine that a one free spin. KEKW
[2:55:58] WindTotem: What will make more money; Diablo Immortal or Diablo 4?
[2:55:59] AlienFlames: a person will end up spending more on microtransactions in long run
[2:56:00] TxHoneybadger: They allow you to get addicted with free to play then once’s your addicted to the game you more tempted to spend on it that’s how they get you in mobile games
[2:56:03] StreamElements: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[2:56:04] GaryVisionary: garyviRock
[2:56:06] hey_im_robby: @chompas11 Much bigger spike.  But the question at the end of the day is, does the game require you to have a full set of 5 star gear to do it's end game content?
[2:56:08] FR4NCO: has one free*
[2:56:10] EarlySummerRain_: @shroud have you seen the new tarkov arena trailer?
[2:56:14] Herturn: Honestly the P2W thing is overblown. People think that if you can buy anything to make your character more powerful for money then it is pay to win.
[2:56:15] Brandon_Trolik: @partak01 wayy lol
[2:56:18] masakari333: it's a different playerbase on mobile

[2:56:35] RRRegi: @Herturn, that is the definition, but it's not necessarily a problem.
[2:56:39] xshinytv: @StonedDruids so true LULW
[2:56:39] datbuddha: is that new skill better than corpse explosion??
[2:56:41] Cbizcbiz: Would much rather an upfront price
[2:56:44] Euforya: Idk if it's just habit from me being a kid but seeing a mobile game cost money is an instant turn off
[2:56:48] datbuddha: @shroud
[2:56:49] TheCamoGirmir: Its only P2W if you do PVP other than that its just extremely Grindy
[2:56:51] m0dsarebugs: @HardcoreCetra the game is fun

[2:56:57] Pengy_Plays_: @hardcorecetra ez L
[2:57:03] smcoffey: @shroud Square tried to sell games on mobile and people lost their minds at $5-$15 games.  F2P is really ingrained in the mobile space
[2:57:08] tvdinnerfromspace: omg shroud your level 38?!?!
[2:57:11] pad1195: how much money does shroud spent boys

[2:58:38] Heiizzenn: do a p2w run with a money counter, it would be great
[2:58:40] トリーー: corpse explosion is good for rifts otherwise the fling is better imo
[2:58:41] miriones: @superneon no he is evil
[2:58:43] datbuddha: ahh okok I'm also doing a necro build but haven't gotten that skill yet

[3:11:54] pad1195: @Glorygeist its all fun and games until you hit paywall man sadge

[3:13:29] Scientia_: the design of this game is garbage for PC
[3:13:29] beefmansteak: there is actual literal paywalls in this game, you can't awaken gems without spending real money and f2p players can't get access to higher tier gems past 2 star that gives up to 300% more life and damage that f2p players can't access
[3:13:38] ItsLG3: What’s the verdict chat, is this worth playing?
[3:13:47] vaughnd5: What the fuck did they do to Diablo

[4:30:53] Grawbad: You only have to spend money if you want to rank on anything.  Like the challenge rifts and character power and all that.  However, for a long time fan, all the things I want to do in a Diablo game are behind the CC coming out.  Min maxing items and gems and such.

[4:38:27] PsyNytes: !spent
[4:38:27] Grawbad: @saVorT7L Gems will be the real money spent.  When you do rifts here you only get the best ones if you buy the items that unlocks a chance.  You might get a lv3 which needs to be upgraded to 5 or a 5 if your lucky.  Then they have resonance and you need to feed gems for other classes to yours to level them.  I read calculations it being 110k to truly max out.
[4:38:27] StreamElements: @PsyNytes, he has bought the battle pass and cosmetics, he's spent around $200 total (as of 6/3)
[4:38:28] MrHans07: @shroud you can extract the essence and put it on any legendary after that

[4:39:36] Radiationnz: Necromancer has the strongest ulti atm as well, but almost any of the shield legendaries are very nice to use, the Grim Reaper is good for a summoning build

[4:44:59] tex_is_subscribed: they aren't made for rich people. they're made for everyone and the common person spends money in the same way "rich" people do.
[4:45:02] Grawbad: IMO the problem with this game is, if you aren't spending a lot, its not worth it to spend anything.  Once you have a whale, or Kraken as they call them now on your server, you will never compete on any boards.  Challenge rifts, character power, anything.
[4:45:23] forchristmas: its straight up same as hearthstone model

[4:46:57] Grawbad: @dgtlshark Well, you don't HAVE to though.  But just crunching numbers and you can find the data everywhere.  To get all gems at 5 and full 50 resonance it will take an avg of 110k to do that.  Some people a little less, some a little more.  Mind you, not everyone is going to do that.  But you will find servers with a whale like that I am sure.

[5:31:23] Blueshark49: can you do like really twist your swing ?
[5:31:23] katzenaktivitaeten: @Protomateria not suprising to me - i dont know how to put this really but i feel like their other games are the same in their category shameless is a theme that goes through their games
[5:31:26] bennycharles: @bennycharles i thought they meant private server when they said not retail, i guess i clumped classic with retail whoops
[5:31:30] Fennyyy: was unplayable for a long time lol
[5:31:32] EFFSIN: Didnt launch with ladder
[5:31:33] xawri: People also have to understand it prob isnt the devs who made it that way, it's up to marketing and analytics
[5:31:39] Hardstylebabe20: its my birthday today SeemsGood
[5:31:41] lastdovahkiiin: @shroud do you play or like yugioh? ty :)
[5:31:47] espi: Twitch chat thinks that not being top 20 on twitch is "a flop"
[5:31:49] ChubbyMikey: and D2 was a bit lacking in QoL advancements
[5:31:50] prnctnplays: did you play WoW in your CS days? @shroud
[5:31:55] Flqnny: @Hardstylebabe20 happy bday!
[5:31:58] KiddouJanse: it was so tedious to play i refunded
[5:31:59] ChubbyMikey: @SnowyEleveN he did
[5:32:01] Vizumn: the ladder launch was bad timing imo, but its cool theyre adding new content
[5:32:11] alienembryo: D2R was very good, but console multiplayer was trash and theres no crossplay
[5:32:12] MastaKlutch: this is not classic?
[5:32:19] Draecco: what is this Atari game you're playing? Kappa
[5:32:19] Protomateria: @katzenaktivitaeten yep, most NetEase games are essentially the same game re-skinned. super shameless
[5:32:20] prnctnplays: @ChubbyMikey oo ok thanks
[5:32:22] Meanseason: Maybe instead of 1 free lego crest per day bump it to 3…  and also make it so rare crests have a better chance to drop lego gems than currently from current drop chance upto 4-6%
[5:32:23] ChubbyMikey: This is classic TBC
[5:32:27] Nexxies: hey guys
[5:32:28] MastaKlutch: oh kk
[5:32:31] chinchin23: like i played diablo 2 backj in the day but its literally 2 button mash boring asf
[5:32:35] mucho___mango: main swap?
[5:32:38] happyphyzik: yes
[5:32:50] JammyJaaam: why buy 450% bundles when you can get 800% bundles?????
[5:32:53] JamesT_III: wait has shroud been playing tbc consistently?
[5:32:54] mucho___mango: mucho___mango subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! main swap?
[5:32:54] phzOG: how is this better than D
[5:32:56] espi: that ret pally rotation
[5:32:56] varg107: what server is this ?
[5:33:04] ChubbyMikey: @JamesT_III Raids every weeks
[5:33:07] ChubbyMikey: *week
[5:33:09] ImBaelfire: wow is dead since 2015. get over it you wow andys

[5:33:16] d_aventry: @espi its riveting
[5:33:16] flashnickgg: MonkaW
[5:33:26] katzenaktivitaeten: @Protomateria ye nothing you can do about it - they are gonna get rich off it because ppl are dumb xD
[5:33:26] JamesT_III: @chubbymikey I had no idea.  that’s awesome
[5:33:32] Ohmnomnomnom: 1337
[5:33:33] psircyen: Yeah guys wow is dead with 30K pop servers. Get over it.
[5:33:34] junix1995: If this works for Diablo Immortal, then this is worrying for Diablo 4. This could probably domino effect into this aggressive pay to win system.
[5:33:37] alienembryo: You've gotta think.  Console is half the playerbase & people want to play with their friend & family
[5:33:38] abSo1ace: this game looks so ugly lmao
[5:33:38] capsulefan81141: I think it was very rushed. it could've looked much better, game play more smoother. i understand with covid it really threw time schedules out of wack. but they also could of just used it as an excuse to put more time into it.
[5:33:39] Protomateria: @katzenaktivitaeten yeppp lol
[5:33:46] BobbanJJ: you still play lost ark?
[5:33:58] Radiationnz: Is there a dropping / trading system in Diablo?
[5:34:00] Muncher406: What did you think of Diablo?
[5:34:03] ChubbyMikey: just to remind chat, shroud has more hours in WoW than any other game he's played
[5:34:07] 0ctxber: the amount of different currencies immortal has is ungodly and its obviously on purpose, they wont nerf the economy LOL people hoping they will are braindead
[5:34:15] ChinzGaming: D2R is fantastic. I got 12th overall (front page) on this first ladder season and #1 Assassin :)
[5:34:18] prnctnplays: LUL
[5:34:20] Fennyyy: not enough healers LUL
[5:34:21] Blueshark49: when you do mele hit in the back shroud
[5:34:30] happyphyzik: @chubbymikey really?
[5:34:31] Raxxlian: Resto shammies are great here
[5:34:35] japa_tiro: your group didnt have fort buff also
[5:34:41] Lembo95: 2 hit dead = not enough healers KEKW
[5:34:41] shim3d: classic servers are literally 5x bigger than vanilla servers. its very much poppin
[5:34:45] ChubbyMikey: yes, really. shroud is an MMO lover at heart
[5:34:48] certifiedgeeky: @Raxxlian Restro shammies are great everywhere
[5:34:49] zaddy1_: !chair
[5:34:49] StreamElements: @zxunavailablexz, he is using the Embody Gaming Chair from Herman Miller x Logitech https://bit.ly/HMxLogitech (With a Herman Miller Eames in the background)
[5:34:55] Protomateria: chat remember that diablo immortal is literally a mobile game lol. D4 will be a normal diablo game
[5:34:56] LOFI_DRUID: already so much better than my life with @moistcr1tikal
[5:34:57] TaySwiftie: @shroud DIABLO 4 OR POE 2 ?
[5:35:00] UnrealNames: @shroud we can see 1 row of the chat, not sure if it matters though ^^
[5:35:08] NIKOLARIUS: shroud1 shroud2
[5:35:09] NIKOLARIUS: shroud3 shroud4
[5:35:15] espi: Clap
[5:35:16] flashnickgg: Pog
[5:35:17] capsulefan81141: diablo 4 will be nothing like diablo immortal.
[5:35:20] NIKOLARIUS: shroud4Head Clap
[5:35:22] violenthugger: NomNom
[5:35:24] SticksonTV: Probably stepped on a bee ? LUL
[5:35:34] kjezR: diablo immortal is such a bad a game
[5:35:39] 1angst: @NIKOLARIUS you did it FeelsStrongMan Clap
[5:35:40] Xeynium: @capsulefan81141 hope this ages well
[5:35:46] Shootermuchacho: played immortal for 10 min and uninstalled
[5:35:49] KiddouJanse: @Protomateria so? pc game has microtransactions lol we had a LITERAL AUCTION HOUSE IN D3 , if immortal succeeds they are gonna make d4 pay to win.
[5:35:52] Texacoco: monka
[5:35:55] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[5:35:57] flashnickgg: @Shootermuchacho LULW
[5:36:00] Fennyyy: phllip inting monkaS
[5:36:01] capsulefan81141: diablo 4 is purely a mobile mmo setup style. literally whole reason it even got pc port was just because people complained.
[5:36:02] Lawless_21: What Diablo server are you on ?
[5:36:04] Lembo95: trust in Phillip
[5:36:06] blackmamba1891: are you going to play diablo?
[5:36:11] Shottylean: @shroud I sat for Phillip
[5:36:12] shim3d: if this was retail no chance xd
[5:36:14] lceWoIf: thats a MASIVE yikes haha
[5:36:16] FrostBeardd: bn.
[5:36:19] XHighHammerX: @shroud have you seen the Tarkov “Arena Mode” !? SeemsGood
[5:36:20] deeray_: whats so different in immortal than diablo 3
[5:36:23] capsulefan81141: immortal not 4 lol im tired
[5:36:23] blackmamba1891: @Lawless_21 yes please
[5:36:24] MiLordSemi: what is it all priest heals?
[5:36:27] Protomateria: @KiddouJanse and how did the community react the AH in D3? they were furious, so furious that blizz was forced to remove it. i think theyve learned from their mistakes when it comes to PC games
[5:36:30] striderik: THATS A BIG OFF
[5:36:30] marcalo1989: @shroud did you get the boon of plenty as well?
[5:36:30] kjezR: immortal is game-changing
[5:36:34] Nycro01: ayo Shroud have u ever thought of doing an ASMR stream?
[5:36:50] m1gzm: did you master seal twisting yet? :o
[5:36:53] kjezR: I am hoping similiar to d2, also if you like the diablo series you should check out project diablo 2 they are about to start a new season
[5:36:56] psircyen: @protomateria blizzard learn from mistakes? You must now play wow.. blizzard doesn’t learn LUL
[5:37:00] MonsterDunkDnT: Protomateria they removed it due to legal issues not the community
[5:37:02] psircyen: Not*
[5:37:07] junix1995: I really hope so
[5:37:08] Protomateria: its gonna be like lost ark, but not p2w (hopefully)
[5:37:12] KiddouJanse: @KiddouJanse yeah that was 10 years ago , now micro is everywhere more then ever and this time they wont stop, look at immortal lol
[5:37:15] shim3d: immortal is a mobile game is the thing to realise
[5:37:19] happyphyzik: I like cosmetic shit but p2w is awful imo
[5:37:22] Preudy: Diablo Immortal is D4's Go Fund Me
[5:37:25] alienembryo: d4 gonna be fire
[5:37:25] flashnickgg: PepegaCredit yeah more skin
[5:37:28] striderik: @KiddouJanse @Protomateria blizz learning? LUL only thing they care about is how much they can squeeze out of you
[5:37:29] junix1995: BP is fine
[5:37:31] ThiefXLFT: battle pass and cosmetics for sure
[5:37:36] Shootermuchacho: @preudy Lol
[5:37:43] KiddouJanse: copium lol
[5:37:43] II_PHO3NIX_II: No
[5:37:56] ThiefXLFT: p2w power wouldnt work in d4 because its not a mobile game
[5:37:57] Protomateria: @MonsterDunkDnT i dont think thats true, but even if it is, there was an enormous backlash from the community over the AH that definitely impacted the removal of it
[5:37:59] KELLYFAST: whats your pc setup now a days
[5:38:00] shim3d: you cant have p2w in an arpg
[5:38:01] blackmamba1891: what is RMT?
[5:38:05] luciusccc: @KiddouJanse its a phone game, its expected to be p2w lol
[5:38:05] 7ingon: is it confirmed that RMT will be in D4?
[5:38:12] El_Tygr: wtf are you talking about
[5:38:18] shizangle: it needs to be banned federally
[5:38:19] BigDab_: @blackmamba1891 real money trading, like buying gold
[5:38:20] El_Tygr: im legit leaving
[5:38:21] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: real money transactions
[5:38:22] capsulefan81141: diablo 4 needs to put more effort into seasonal.
[5:38:22] limerencemusic: thats a bad take
[5:38:24] tupacx92: @blackmamba1891 ral money trade
[5:38:24] Buhhbye: o god no plz mike
[5:38:28] blackmamba1891: @blackmamba1891 thanks!
[5:38:31] tupacx92: real*
[5:38:32] Buhhbye: just pay for cosmetics only
[5:38:34] R1ptz: 0.0
[5:38:35] victorvanhugo: is this diablo immortal ?
[5:38:36] ThiefXLFT: rmt will be in game if blizz does it or not, but its not gonna be scam city if blizz has it
[5:38:37] BigDab_: np :)
[5:38:38] mohdo605: anything like LA im out
[5:38:41] shim3d: have it like d2 where theres no real currency
[5:38:44] MrSkeezyMak: or they could police their game FeelsBadMan
[5:38:44] KenDuckk: Happy B'day shroud!!
[5:38:49] MonsterDunkDnT: Protomateria nah the actual diablo community didnt care theres an established president of paying for items in d2, you couldnt touch the ladder unless you used jsp
[5:38:51] Buhhbye: literally just do what PoE does
[5:38:51] alienembryo: Blizzard announced Diablo IV release date.  2032
[5:38:53] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: the future of gaming is rmt, ppl need to accept it
[5:38:54] blackmamba1891: disable trading in game
[5:38:56] capsulefan81141: i like diablo 3 seasonal themes and i feel they could've done more money wise for seasonal.
[5:38:56] TorchOSRS: the rmt is always cheaper though, like lost ark
[5:38:58] ThiefXLFT: truth
[5:38:58] Buhhbye: skins for days
[5:39:00] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: its like taxes
[5:39:02] StevenLittleBear: Happy Birthday Mikey!
[5:39:06] lBrief: you can't fight rmt no game done it until now
[5:39:07] luciusccc: @shim3d and people are going to use something else as a currency, same thing
[5:39:08] anythiNG: just dont make shit tradeable excpet for account
[5:39:08] Coff11nxD: Happy birthday Shrood
[5:39:10] capsulefan81141: which in turn would of allowed them make more content for the season themes
[5:39:11] happyphyzik: sad times then
[5:39:12] striderik: blizzard games on 2022 OMEGALUL
[5:39:12] anythiNG: and sell cosmetics by the assload
[5:39:13] BigDab_: Bring back AH and let players sell gold
[5:39:13] xawri: Do what CSGO does
[5:39:14] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: you dont have to like it just live with it
[5:39:17] Buhhbye: yeah fuck it
[5:39:20] lBrief: poe has A TON of rmt
[5:39:22] justGonzi: yeah but cosmetics only
[5:39:29] tearsofayoungprincess: ЫП
[5:39:29] imshouston: theres a reason mtmmo and the like exist
[5:39:30] justGonzi: and stash tabs
[5:39:31] cleangreaves: PoE does hella skins for crazy cash tho @shroud
[5:39:32] ChubbyMikey: In Tiny Tinas Wonderlands people sell game save files through EBAY. for $15
[5:39:36] Warrstein: Not just cosmetics function too
[5:39:36] MrSkeezyMak: PoE also sucks
[5:39:36] happyphyzik: what about fortnite?
[5:39:39] Kahricus: ???
[5:39:39] Buhhbye: i meant how they monetized their game aka paying for skins
[5:39:43] anythiNG: make items and gold and everythign account bound ez fix
[5:39:45] MastaDebator: just buy wow token and p2w everything
[5:39:49] Abohnher: Most people who buy gold and shit want the easy way to do it, in game
[5:39:53] tunelinkmain: @ChubbyMikey WHAT
[5:39:53] Avarit: That's crazy, game save files LUL
[5:39:56] 1zewski: no that just shifts where the money goes. it still devalues the product itself.
[5:39:58] BigDab_: @anythiNG tru
[5:40:01] ThiefXLFT: @anythiNG people would riot over that as well, esp the diablo crowd
[5:40:02] xawri: I think CSGO and Valorant are great examples of games that make tons of $$$ without being P2W
[5:40:02] Protomateria: @MonsterDunkDnT some people in the community didnt care, but most people did. and most people dont care about competitive ladder, most are just casual players
[5:40:13] dwexed: has Crusader Strike always been in TBC? I thought it was added in WoTLK
[5:40:18] 1zewski: @anythiNG then it just turns into account selling so timmacSHRUG
[5:40:22] junix1995: Diablo 4 would gain a lot of popularity if they reward players more for grinding the game. I hope they take focus on that. more cash on that then asking for it ingame imo
[5:40:22] II_PHO3NIX_II: No chance theres less rmt with it in the game rather than out. I get what you're saying but its far, far more if theres no ban risk.
[5:40:27] Bishox: @dwexed yep
[5:40:27] PatchMyEye: @ChubbyMikey this sounds very weird
[5:40:28] chalupa_batmang: CSGO and Valorant are competitive tho, the main thing u want arent drops its the wins
[5:40:38] ChubbyMikey: @tunelinkmain not a joke. A treamer puts his save faile sin his discord for his fans to play with, and some dude was selling the download for $15 on ebay
[5:40:38] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: the bigger problem is thinking u can compete for free in any soirt or e sport
[5:40:38] ThiefXLFT: lots of diablo players find their pleasure mainly in trading stuff
[5:40:39] Dawgpants: mmo/rpg gamers love their rmt LULW
[5:40:43] anythiNG: @1zewski i mean.....thats really not the point tho so it doesnt matter
[5:40:45] MonsterDunkDnT: Protomateria i dunno about most caring, but sure most are casuals and they dont matter because they dont pay the bills
[5:40:50] ChubbyMikey: *a streamer
[5:40:51] dwexed: @Bishox ok cool
[5:40:55] StreamElements: Subscribe to my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/shroud
[5:40:59] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: its free to play not free to compete
[5:41:02] GrooveGrindGore: ghazzy in raid Pog
[5:41:04] mememasterbob: I didnt know anyone still played wow
[5:41:06] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: same as athletics
[5:41:09] Babylungs420: back to diablo lol
[5:41:10] Bishox: ye
[5:41:11] GrooveGrindGore: faerlina?
[5:41:12] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: shit costs money
[5:41:13] RyanRigormortis: wait HUH shroud playing WOW?!
[5:41:19] capsulefan81141: If Diablo immortal really wanted to make more money. They should of had an actual proper auction house.
[5:41:23] Warrstein: Kill the community and fix the game!
[5:41:34] smashkan: thats how BDO is
[5:41:36] imshouston: if diablo 2 was that way no one would play it
[5:41:41] YoLaph: literally ironman runescape
[5:41:42] chalupa_batmang: @capsulefan81141 d3 early AH was a golden era
[5:41:44] anythiNG: make it like d3 where you can trade the items to only the ppl that were there when it dropped
[5:41:45] Protomateria: @MonsterDunkDnT casuals are the most important player base in almost all games lol, thats why most blizz games try to appeal to them
[5:41:46] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: its already in 1000s of titles, its not going anywhere
[5:41:46] ThiefXLFT: thats basically what diablo 3 is right now
[5:41:47] marcalo1989: individual loot pools like eso would be good
[5:41:48] imshouston: the economy is the game in a loot driven game
[5:41:51] vexnetrekk: there would be botting services for real world $ to grind gear @shroud
[5:41:56] dwexed: I'd play the game if it costs $5/month or less
[5:41:57] baymeister: @smashkan thats not how bdo is what
[5:41:57] shim3d: kind of but trading in d2 is a very big and cool part of the game
[5:41:58] solojuggernaut: diablo was before POE, I hate hearing this argument for POE.
[5:42:02] prnctnplays: thats how botting comes in
[5:42:06] Warrstein: Then people will just buy accounts
[5:42:11] II_PHO3NIX_II: Killing trading will kill the longevity. D3 is exactly that right now and doesnt last a week past season.
[5:42:16] MonsterDunkDnT: Protomateria try looking at their financial reports and see where their money comes from :)
[5:42:18] ItsJustLooney: i think lupo said he did the math and without spending a dime, it would take a decade to get to max level gems on diablo immortal
[5:42:19] smashkan: @baymeister you literally cant trade with people, you have to use an in-game price min and max auction house.
[5:42:19] alienembryo: I'd give Diablo Immortal an 8.5 soo far,  i'm lvl 45 right now, played every diablo game.  We'll see where it goes
[5:42:22] anythiNG: yes but buying accounts and botting is a whole other conversation besides pay2win
[5:42:25] capsulefan81141: @chalupa_batmang i've read so much on it. i unfortunely didn't get into it that early.
[5:42:26] ThiefXLFT: @anythiNG if you go to the forums youll see lots and lots of people crying about that tho, even tho i think its better for the game ppl will go nuts over it, but i guess they go nuts over anything
[5:42:31] ThatsProto: Is this diablo immortal?
[5:42:32] General_HAM: Now do Tarkov lol
[5:42:34] Warrstein: They will make the accounts they are buying with bots
[5:42:34] ashfire55: for every solo self found elitist, theres 10 other dad gamers with 9-5 jobs that wants to game. hence p2w
[5:42:40] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: the shortcut is buy an account of someone who quitting, get it for 10% of rtm value and move on
[5:42:43] Protomateria: @MonsterDunkDnT yeah, most of it is from casual mobile game players, like cod mobile
[5:42:45] Texacoco: monkaSTEER
[5:42:54] Bishox: @anything is conversation currently about retail,classic or diablo , im confused LUL
[5:42:54] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: its not that hard to solve
[5:42:55] chalupa_batmang: Tarkov arena got announced!!!!! now THAT is something worth hyping over Kappa LUL
[5:43:01] YyTonyMa: seal twisting genius of a generation
[5:43:05] cleangreaves: @ashfire55 Thats broke nlogic... dad gamer doesnt equal P2W at all...
[5:43:06] 1zewski: @anythiNG i agree with you but that still doesn't get rid of the RMT degrading the value of progress made in a game
[5:43:08] Buhhbye: idk i feel like u just let the battle of RMT go and just sell cosmetics
[5:43:23] jonr_yt_aka_crookguts: acc trading is big business in rmt
[5:43:27] Mevar_R: BabyRage I play mobile games
[5:43:28] Warrstein: RMT is the way of the future its good for the industry
[5:43:32] 1zewski: @anythiNG however, i don't really have a solution other than ban trading which is dumb.
[5:43:32] shadelvl100: Yo where did ron jeremy go
[5:43:39] dwexed: what's RMT?
[5:43:48] prnctnplays: @dwexed real money trading
[5:43:50] Bishox: @warrstein its litteraly  killing games
[5:43:51] Dawgpants: let mmos kill their own genre with rmt idc LULW
[5:43:53] dwexed: Oh ok
[5:43:55] chalupa_batmang: real money transaction @dwexed
[5:43:56] Protomateria: @Warrstein it might be the way of the future, but its definitely not good for the industry LULW
[5:43:56] z3rodown: No, needs to be like PoE, full trade
[5:44:01] stealthx23: then there will be paid runs thats not good
