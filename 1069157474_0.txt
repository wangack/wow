[0:56:06] sinlesssinner: flying willl make all of those easier to get
[0:56:13] Piebringer619: those simplier times when you was able get mounts from vendors
[0:56:15] Sephirothxz: I think flying needs to be up as soon as u reach max level. That worked so well in the past gave people reasons to ho farm shit cause wasnt super hard to even reach the zone. Im ok with farming shit but struggling to even reach the zone makes it super bad.

[1:00:30] Clicklesly: Those sockets not working with one of the main systems of the expansion is really weird ^^
[1:00:33] aminus: Also the fact that you have to have the domination socket gear and so if the pieces have terrible stats you’re stuck with terrible stats on your gear
[1:00:39] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I'm sad, that u cant upgrade ur existing legendary with a socket.

[1:06:54] Sandmaker: Its not in the game anymore to get sadly.
[1:07:00] oreo_mintx: @rickeynl its from magetower in legion. unavailable right now though
[1:07:12] RickeyNL: cheers guys :)
[1:07:18] paraxyz: i won the item with a roll and the player who lost the roll reported me for ninja, the item got removed and i got punished as a ninjalooter. but i won the roll LOL
[1:07:53] oreo_mintx: @xpara97 tough luck. make a ticket. its not like if you're reddit post blows up that it will change anything
[1:08:05] Doog45: were you supposed to roll on it?
[1:08:14] Shrenko: @xpara97 just move on... you have many weeks to get the item again :P
[1:08:15] Sephirothxz: Removing mage tower was the biggest mistake blizzard did was really really fun and some classes without that mage tower appearance feels so bad to play.
[1:08:23] paraxyz: @otp_ekko66 I opened a ticket
[1:08:48] paraxyz: its just if thats the case now I can whisper my buddy that 1 item is locked ... and dont have to tell the raid. thats the case in my ticket and reddit post. this would anmate ppl to ninjaloot

[1:08:57] Sandmaker: @rektariz not really a mistake, it was apart of legion expansion. Like many things in this game, once the expansion is done so are the "special Things"
[1:09:28] MrGattz: what they should have did with the mage tower was make it a "battle pass" system. where the rewards were unique every 6 months or something for doing the tower challenges

[1:11:09] Shrenko: @MrGattz they would have to add new bosses though, right? it would be boring to fight the same bosses over and over
[1:11:40] zeiours: @towelliee Do you think there will be a new hero class in 10.0?

[1:12:31] MrGattz: @Shrenko well yeah but its not hard to add new bosses. its a mage tower. they can just add mobs like idk 15 hoggers with an increased level. or idk they could do literally anything.
[1:12:40] Ezekyler: no one likes the shitshow story they create for this expansion KEKW
[1:12:45] lithium364: of youre casual and liked mechagon and nazjatar dont come back kekw

[1:12:51] Sincline387: people who are asking if you should come back, don't, but uhhh give me your stuff!
[1:12:59] Xsilentghost: Do you still think there's no 9.3 and that 9.2 will be some 14 boss raid ready to prepare for the maybe the longest content drought in wow history
[1:12:59] Sephirothxz: I cant stand playing tbc classic it doesnt feel like a real game feels like some sort of side mini games where people will quit as soon as retail has new content
[1:13:00] Relic7: @captain69 second week of patch
[1:13:00] yeahright_95: hello
[1:13:14] Shrenko: Im just gonna clear HC raid with my guild and dip again, not really anything else to do in 9.1
[1:13:35] feherlofia123: @rektariz ???? imo tbc and wrath will have more players than retail eventually
[1:13:46] zaney87: what do you think the meta tank, dps and heals will be for 9.1?
[1:13:49] akaari5486: also, whats the point of playing classic servers where they scrap everything whwn wotlk comes out
[1:14:05] feherlofia123: @rektariz retail is literally a hack n slash game now
[1:14:14] Swiftytrigger: is ptr regional or nah?
[1:14:23] Shrenko: @popikaify ??? you can say the same with retail. whats the point on getting raid loot now when it comes irrelevant next tier?
[1:14:34] Sephirothxz: @feherlofia123 doesnt matter its still and will always be the real main game.
[1:14:53] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @feherlofia123 a classic version of an expansion wont chage the community anyway, so it doesnt matter what u play imo
[1:14:55] dr__mantis_toboggan_md: so people think venthyr bear will be the play in M+ next patch or is that just boomie?
[1:15:08] zeiours: Do you think there will be a new hero class in 10.0? @towelliee

[1:16:38] Sephirothxz: @feherlofia123 because u are forced to do so u dont meet people cause u want or they want to but cause otherwise u would be alone. So its artificial like retail lfg
[1:16:53] Shrenko: @popikaify well yeah thats what Blizzard wanted, to get everyone over to TBC. They were kind enough to give people a choice and everyone went over to BC. People will go back to Classic vanilla when they add fresh servers
[1:17:02] Nokterian: WEW

[1:17:47] feherlofia123: @rektariz if you dont want to play an mmo u could always play a single player game... oh wait, youre already playing retail, i forgot
[1:18:13] akaari5486: @shrenko still feels like an temporary aid... like private servers.its not a real game.. all my progress has been saved since tbc on retail ifu get what i mean
[1:18:29] Nokterian: LUL
[1:18:37] pyromancer001: so im pretty new to wow, only got the game 2 days ago, how do I change my UL to be similar to what I see many streamers using ?
[1:18:42] pyromancer001: *UI
[1:19:04] XarkoLP: dratnos is the brain
[1:19:20] Relic7: @pyromancer001 If you go on YouTube you will find some good guides. But a website is Curseforge or WoW interface. I'd suggest watching a video though :)
[1:19:29] Shrenko: @popikaify people who play BC play for the experience which is way superior to the experience you get from playing retail. people doesnt care if their character and progress gets wiped, they will allways have a good time because it is a real MMO

[1:19:34] Sephirothxz: @feherlofia123 u can be social as u want in retail aswell the problem is not the games the problem are the people. A game needs to force u to interact with people? U can meet as many people as u want in retail aswell the difference between retail and classic is that u have the choice to do so.

[1:20:43] Shrenko: @rektariz you're not really right there. retail is made so like you dont really have to interact with anyone else. its not just the peoples fault
[1:21:14] feherlofia123: @rektariz sooo... whats bad about having to team up with people to play the game?
[1:21:25] PHYYY: RWF is probs going to have a bear tank and a prot warrior. Or might even be 2 warriors, prot warrs just too strong in Sancy.
[1:21:27] akaari5486: @shrenko its all subjective, more ppl play retail for sure, and im not simping. Classic servers are there just to milk their playerbase even more, in a long term thats bad cuz of split in the playerbase even more, if retail. becomes better some day
[1:21:33] Nokterian: Bears always been hp chonks
[1:21:44] Nokterian: excuse while i pull the whole room
[1:21:58] EFFSIN: Where’s the seed of corruption
[1:22:05] Sephirothxz: @shrenko if u wanna do easy content yes but if u wanna push high key mythic raiding or high end pvp u have to interact with people.
[1:22:10] AJPro: I thought, DHs are the hp chonks
[1:22:12] akaari5486: i personally couldnt care less about making 20 friends a day,personal preference

[1:22:36] Nokterian: no bears always been the sturdy one
[1:22:41] Nokterian: Legion bear was the best
[1:22:42] Buckwink: legion bear was legit
[1:22:54] Sephirothxz: People in classic interact with u because they needs u otherwise they wouldnt give an f about u
[1:22:54] Nokterian: the artifact weapon was so damn good
[1:23:19] Ezekyler: that was one of the problems on BFA, they took almost everything from Bear and left an empty shell
[1:23:22] ThatGuyFayde: would be way too OP
[1:23:22] pyromancer001: just confirming the bear hes mentioning is a druid form right?

[1:23:34] feherlofia123: i quit in cara, came back for shadowlands.... i felt so lonely in retail. classic was more enjoyable.... only thing i liked better in retail was leveling and dungeon pace
[1:23:38] feherlofia123: cata
[1:23:52] Whoracle1337: i hope they give us 2 leggos at some point
[1:24:10] aikopooh: 2 leggos maybe 9.2 or 9.25
[1:24:12] AJPro: They have to, at least in 9.3 or something
[1:24:15] pink_ninja_turtle: good morning @towelliee 💪 greetings from Denmark 😊
[1:24:18] Relic7: Why is it a Retail v Classic / TBC debate? The fact is that both games are made by the same developer and you hope they take the best bits from both as well as new stuff to continue to improve the game
[1:24:32] Nokterian: look at the trash trigger
[1:24:39] Nokterian: when it goes it goes
[1:24:41] qtla: I hope they give a good and completed game at some point
[1:24:59] Nokterian: from the leggo
[1:25:15] Sephirothxz: Im just saying u can make friends in retail aswel if u want. The only different between classic wow and retail wow its that u choose to make friends and are not forced by the game.
[1:25:23] Kheonik: @Relic7 because people are horny for one or the other and not both and they have to apparently hate whichever they don't like
[1:25:30] Nokterian: LUL
[1:25:41] theasherbringer: Do you play SWTOR ever?
[1:25:41] Relic7: @Kheonik That's society in general isn't at the moment? LUL
[1:25:43] aikopooh: unless u doing damping arena
[1:25:48] sinlesssinner: with prideful there is no issue with mana lol wait til next season
[1:25:50] Relic7: @theasherbringer That is a great game
[1:25:52] akaari5486: ye try doing hc or especially mythic raid by not interacting wiht others
[1:26:00] Kheonik: @Relic7 yep pretty much, so same situation here. It's stupid
[1:26:15] Shrenko: SWTOR is very much alive, its doing very well
[1:26:22] feherlofia123: @rektariz how is queing for dungeon finder and never seeing the people again after dungeon is done good
[1:26:22] jimmwayne: the star wars game so awsome
[1:26:25] Relic7: @Kheonik It's just weird because it's not even MMO v MMO - it's literally patch v patch, expansion v expansion - bonkers
[1:26:28] ThatGuyFayde: TBC threat makes me appreciate retail more lol
[1:26:30] Relic7: RIFT is really dead now isn't it?
[1:26:32] SirTedric: lol wow 15 swtor 10 lol
[1:26:33] SirTedric: old
[1:26:34] SirTedric: lol

[1:26:35] Kinghorn: good morning towHAMUP
[1:26:42] theasherbringer: @Relic7 I love the game and story I love it but had no one to play with to do end game content.
[1:26:44] Shrenko: @Relic7 yes
[1:26:46] EFFSIN: Played swtor when I was 10
[1:26:46] musicbyaustin_: wow is 13
[1:26:55] UchihaJesus: And how old is WOW again? LUL
[1:27:01] Nokterian: WoW is 17 years old this november
[1:27:03] SirTedric: 13 lol
[1:27:07] jimmwayne: 25
[1:27:11] theasherbringer: Remember warcraft is 25 or something? lol
[1:27:14] akaari5486: wow is 17,looks nice still
[1:27:27] akaari5486: unlike ffx14
[1:27:27] Relic7: @theasherbringer Yeah the end game in SWTOR was a problem on release, and it took them too long to fix. I just played for the story arcs.
[1:27:27] Sephirothxz: @feherlofia123 srsly do you think the game is raid finder and heroic dungeon? Try do some hc-mythic raiding and high end pvp or mplus there you go finding and talking to people. Find a guild so u can talk with people.
[1:27:38] Nokterian: WoW still looks amazing
[1:27:39] Relic7: !00%
[1:27:40] aikopooh: there is ppl who looks better when ages wow is like that
[1:27:41] blade_killa: true
[1:27:43] solsaver12: agree
[1:27:45] sinlesssinner: because of the artstyle
[1:27:47] Hexof: wow has also updated its looks multiple times
[1:27:49] theasherbringer: The thing is wow updates the graphics, also the art style is ageless.
[1:27:52] Nokterian: You see it in everything
[1:28:07] Nokterian: character models being updated, new rig animations
[1:28:08] Pufendorf99: Well, Wow could afford the plastic surgeon, the others not
[1:28:11] indiegarona: lol
[1:28:12] Relic7: That's what happens when you have a defined art style and theme - and don't go for the photo realism type of stuff
[1:28:24] akaari5486: i downloaded ffx14 and aion during wod, uninstalled 2 mins later, looks so bad tbh. cant stand that tyoe of graphics

[1:29:51] Clicklesly: It does make it faster than people waiting for someone to start claiming spots Kappa
[1:30:38] theasherbringer: I think is SWTOR did some graphics updates which they have done a few but did a major overhaul It kinda made other mmos boring since the story in star wars is soooo good.
[1:31:06] sinlesssinner: @Clicklesly yea exactly, not sure why ppl are calling it an addon for bad ppl only
[1:31:09] theasherbringer: that character connection is so much fun.
[1:31:24] Relic7: I actually really liked RIFT when it came out

[4:31:40] Vile_: @Towelliee A lot of people take these tier lists as they're not meant to be, yeah. These tier lists are definitely for high-end shit -- and a lot of the playerbase think that "viable" and "optimal" mean the same thing.

[5:48:52] Shadowlemur01: @Shadowlemur01 figured, the raids are 9/10 times good. I just dont think Korthia and new torghast stuff is gonna keep me entertained until 9.2 comes out, I have a gut feeling that we wont see an announcement for 9.2 until that blizzconline global thing in february
[5:49:00] Easymode: Easymode subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[5:49:21] Triknives: Damn 9.2 in feb would be brutal

[5:50:02] jaalexba: 9.2 on 09/02/21 Kappa

[5:50:09] Shadowlemur01: Idk man... i just feel like theyre so far behind right now and they cant keep up
[5:50:10] Triknives: They should take us back to the outlands for the 3rd time
[5:50:17] Q_TheDreamer: Maybe they'll make the infinite pirate dragon a store mount Kappa
[5:50:46] gfield2k: From what you seeing from this expansion, what do you think the next one might be about @Towelliee
[5:50:56] Spykex02: @Towelliee i'm having trouble understanding gear with my prot pally. I got 3 pieces from kara last night, and they are more armor and more defense, but i'm losing spellpower. Is everything from kara just bis, or are some heroic pieces still better
[5:50:58] shuffy19: Whats your spellpower like?
[5:51:00] Padarius: I hope they get it figured out padari1Love
[5:51:14] niceteis: but they need to fire more people for bobbys bonuses

[5:55:51] souleymaster: is Sylvana going to die on this patch
[5:55:59] Rictamar: oh it will, almost certainly
[5:56:07] Rictamar: I think this is a two patch xpac
[5:56:20] robertjordan83: @Towelliee still think 9.2 is last patch/tier?
[5:56:25] yunitoYuniro: Feel like this patch won’t have much for casual after the first 2 months
[5:56:26] Q_TheDreamer: @souleymaster We're gonna fight her, definitely. But whether she dies for good is still anyone's guess
[5:56:42] nightmayor12: how come they never made mythic warfronts?

[5:58:46] theDirtyon3: i think we get 9.3 just because they do not want another WoD style xpac where they can half thier content
[5:58:50] Q_TheDreamer: Maaaaan, I just wanna know what's going on on Azeroth while we've been in the Shadowlands. Ol' Azzy's been getting the shit kicked out of her soul left and right. That's gonna come to a head sooner or later
[5:58:52] Buckwink: look on the bright side, if SL is WoD 2.0 then 10.0 will be Legion 2.0 :)
[5:58:54] KineasRM: idk, except the long wait for 9,1, i'm really enjoying SL
[5:59:00] Shadowlemur01: Isn't true that they shift resources for developing the next expac around 9.2 though? Won't that affect release cadence
[5:59:13] KineasRM: it gave me some time to play PoE and LoL
[5:59:21] 3663Sharad: Maybe a Brawlers Guild update with a .5 update to stretch?
[5:59:22] goblinknows: @KineasRM me too

[5:59:50] senjidot: 9.3? you're taliking about 2023? @Towelliee
[5:59:59] fistofnature: 9.2 introduces maw corruption with 2 old zones being revamped KEKW
[6:00:11] KineasRM: @goblinknows if they just balance the classes a bit more, prime time balance was cata for me
[6:00:13] Q_TheDreamer: It feels greedy to ask at this point, but hopefully we spend some time in the in-between in Shadowlands
[6:00:19] Yagr6: i dont wanna see the jailer next xpansion
[6:00:26] CADZtv: isnt the light also considered evil tho?
[6:00:28] theDirtyon3: nah they gonna take us to azeroth in 9.3 for sure
[6:00:30] aeyt: 9.2 just adds another extra island to the maw KEKW
[6:00:35] guppgup: how would you suggest keeping up on threat as a prot pally on gruul?
[6:00:37] pakapasiti: they did say there are untold numbers of worlds in the shadowlands though right
[6:00:40] theDirtyon3: maybe dragon isles?
[6:00:43] Coors1962: ether invading azeroth or an Elune showdown lol
[6:01:06] goblinknows: @KineasRM i didnt play cata but ive heard it was best as far as class balance
[6:01:07] seanb4games: I feel like the Jailer isn't a very compelling villian and he needs to die quickly.

[6:10:43] pakapasiti: or one sylvanas cut scene
[6:10:51] Donnicton: I suspect in reality he'll disappear just as suddenly as he was written in.
[6:10:58] Aedarax: or they do it in a 0.5 patch KEKW
[6:11:02] Wrizzik: Jailer is Marcellus Wallace. Got it.
[6:11:12] Shadowlemur01: @Aedarax KEKW
[6:11:35] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee Jailer killled in .5 patch raid, calling it Kappa
[6:11:35] vibratinglemur: I think they'll pull something similar to what they did with WoD Gul'dan. They'll throw him into the next expac and we'll either deal with him halfway, or at the end
[6:11:40] zoovthepally: It would be neat if we lost this expansion
[6:11:48] Elzz: denathus so aint dead either hes in his sword no?

[6:13:29] NA_Mus: so azhara 2.0?
[6:13:29] CritcobainTV: D:
[6:13:34] swordwindgaming: Jailer has to die because Blizzard probably didn't write out an end game for what if Jailer wins. Everyone just knows that Jailer wins = bad.
[6:13:37] assman_ny: He should not die
[6:13:47] CritcobainTV: at least the sword isn't in him
[6:13:49] CritcobainTV: monkaS
[6:14:04] Villie: Hasn’t we seen this before, beat the female last boss and the chains brake and the big bad guy is free?
[6:14:18] Episodical: if the jailer gets free, for how big of a threat he is, they will need to make a drastic change to the world or the characters (ie character deaths)
[6:14:19] Elzz: what about anduin being a lich king
[6:14:53] almostnate_: Same same, but different

[6:16:18] Wulfgrym: i think sylvanus is being manipulated because she too was killed by frostmourn
[6:16:30] Wrizzik: Sylvanus was the friend we made along the way?
[6:16:34] assman_ny: IF she ever did, she would be back at some point

[6:18:28] TriumphantToad: sylvanas just needs to go away for a while
[6:18:30] 3663Sharad: Did you heared about the folklore stuff?
[6:18:35] generaljosh721: she's gonna go reeeee to a farm somewhere

[6:26:57] BamfHoss: biggy biggy cant you see
[6:27:00] ElPolloBatman: nzoth comes back, nyalotha was merely a setback Kappa
[6:27:03] Mathhbm: yeah true
[6:27:04] TommyVercetii: anything that is "just a dream" i feel like is a copmpout

[6:34:30] Foogalicious: was there ever wildstar private servers?
[6:34:33] Buckwink: wildstar was fun and I miss it sometimes
[6:34:35] Vigi9413: didn't we kill wildstar?
[6:34:40] MuttonChopins: didnt someone already made a video about it and a dev replied to that video?
[6:34:48] swordwindgaming: wildstar killed wildstar

[6:36:05] y0rtek: time to start a gofundme
[6:36:08] assman_ny: Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free
[6:36:14] CADZtv: bns lasted longer then wildstar did
[6:36:19] avat707: leveling druid?
[6:36:21] Scoopachip: mhow much is basic flying
[6:36:27] vibratinglemur: I enjoyed BnS until I got to the end game and realized just how big of a paywall it was to progress
[6:36:43] Vigi9413: all those sponsored streams
[6:37:14] CADZtv: the thing that killed bns was optimisation and p2w elements and they promoted it as a pvp game for us in the western side
[6:37:16] chickenbeefnoodle: What tank you playing in 9.1? @towelliee
[6:37:18] Wildside1177: I don't even remember Blade and Soul but I love Wildstar.
[6:37:48] Vigi9413: Will Amazon's game flop? @towelliee
[6:37:51] CADZtv: bns was leaps above wildstar personally

[6:38:18] Buckwink: was prot pally not raid meta in bfa either? I cant remember
[6:38:19] swordwindgaming: BnS is still around. Mobile sequel launched this year. Actual sequel was supposed to beta launch this year but got held back.
[6:38:19] AceOfTheNorth: I mean, you can make a game cater to the super hardcore, you just have to budget and plan appropriately that you'll have a small userbase
[6:38:20] MuttonChopins: I do hope Riot's MMO will be good
[6:38:40] Vigi9413: riot makes good games
[6:38:48] iparanoo: AOC art style look boring
[6:38:57] Algfader: has any game ever come close to world of warcrafts fluid moments? i know that's basicly the only thing i was dissapointed at in wildstar. It had the cartoonish style and stuff like that. But not the movement fluidness
[6:39:02] fluffy_fingerz: mmo devs should learn how to create depth to their games, for casual and hardcore players depending on the person time available and playstyle.
[6:39:04] NovaSun84: BDO... essentially LUL
[6:39:05] scartotem: I had you on in the background and I heard AOC and I thought you were about to start talking politics @Towelliee
[6:39:12] Buckwink: I would just want to be a mayor and not even fight lol

[6:41:13] Archiee: yeah, that's a failure waiting to happen
[6:41:28] Vit_Mann: people want a game to waste their time on
[6:41:41] NotEnoughMana: WutFace
[6:41:44] Archiee: that's a game company who doesn't respect the time and money of it's potential player base. Guaranteed to fail

[6:42:59] CCG_337: yeah, alot of Wow players will try AoC, because they re still think theumy are hardcores, but at the end will come back to wow, because wow systems are more bearable and that is ironic.
[6:43:10] Aidler: and they will gladly delay their preview again
[6:43:28] CADZtv: im in
[6:43:30] Vondrex: @Towelliee do you have and elvui export file? Trying to get my unitframes setup

[6:44:27] Vit_Mann: @M3rkyyy Alexandria Ocacia-Cortez
[6:44:28] NotEnoughMana: the thing about subs is why would you pay sub for that when you can pay sub for WoW Kappa
[6:44:29] M3rkyyy: its still in development and will be for a long time i think
[6:44:40] letsrock_pt: swtor was an example
[6:44:47] Vigi9413: is that better than a sub + buying xpacs?
[6:44:51] Aidler: is Lost Ark ever coming to the rest of the world?
[6:44:53] iparanoo: WOW combat, fluidity is to good
[6:44:54] CCG_337: I like swtor lol
[6:44:58] Jeffro199o: Swtor has survived very well using only subs lol
[6:45:00] nymrinikus: Its an interesting idea to me to go sub instead of any type of box price.

[6:45:41] M3rkyyy: SC coming out in 2030 probably, my best guess
[6:45:43] memnon94: I tried the Lost Ark alpha, it was crazy good
[6:45:44] anacronz: i think aoc is gonna be wierd. i have more faith in new world now cause of the effort they putiing in the game

[6:46:40] Aidler: @towelliee is Ark casual friendly?
[6:46:42] shortyforthewin: isent ark a pvp game?

[6:46:50] M3rkyyy: im looking forward to lost ark, but i hate it when i see those fckin skins, bunnies and other cartoon stuff ... what the hell
[6:47:09] pk99: game feels old i've heard about it for so long

[6:47:29] catlinv: Damn I feel old
[6:47:44] CADZtv: so 3 years to launch to western side
[6:47:45] Kyrrua: diablo 4 looks old next to lost ark despite LA being old itself
[6:47:50] shortyforthewin: any news about diablo 4 guys anyone know
[6:47:51] Vigi9413: wow keeps releasing things and pushing other games back lol
[6:48:07] Quikbeard: North American trailer of Lost Ark does the game zero justice.
[6:48:19] Vit_Mann: i would be

[6:48:26] oneshot2real: Nope
[6:48:30] iparanoo: i would not make à mmo

[6:49:01] iparanoo: mmo are dring, ppl want fast compétitive game
[6:49:04] Iver_monk: The beast is wounded
[6:49:07] CADZtv: lost ark actually has alot of traction for it timthetatman, shroud, cloakzy, sypher all wanna play it among us
[6:49:16] oneshot2real: FF14 only benefited because of the content drought
[6:49:17] Buckwink: im too invested in wow
[6:49:21] CADZtv: among otherts
[6:49:25] gfield2k: People be shitting on WoW. But it has always stud the test of time. An everyone is always trying to compete with WoW. An WoW just keeping doing it's thing.
[6:49:25] Vit_Mann: @iparanoo they aren't dying, look at how popular TBC is and its a grindfest

[6:49:35] Reckless_Monk: @oneshot2real for real
[6:49:42] WarhoundUK: the only thing keeping wow alive since WoD is the amount of years we'd all sunk into the game and our hopes that one day they'll actually make a good game again
[6:49:47] CADZtv: ff14 still dawgshit
[6:49:49] Shadowlemur01: I have played this game for 13 fucking years, I will probably play this game until it dies
[6:49:53] Tzarvahl: its not really competing with wow, its the investment everyone has made. its hard to get ppl to stop playing a game, that they've been playing for over half their life

[6:51:05] Quikbeard: if you guys want legitimate genuine Lost Ark info when it launches then you need to keep up with datmodz imo
[6:51:06] happybooger: do you think Lost Ark is going to be more popular than New World?
[6:51:08] nymrinikus: Let's be honest WoW will probably kill itself before another game "takes it down". It's just too much in our system as far as the mmo community is concerned
[6:51:11] Idlehandsmc: Idlehandsmc subscribed with Prime. 
[6:51:12] CCG_337: ffxiv is a good game, wow put itself in this position, actually squareenix never promotion the game as a wow killer actually YoshiP always speaks good about wow

[6:51:24] CADZtv: @gfield2k lost ark has had interest for it along time
[6:51:25] danimoto10: nicee
[6:51:28] memnon94: f2p with founder packs yep
[6:51:31] backpackax: Does New World have any shot at rivaling WoW?
[6:51:31] oneshot2real: I have to recraft a total of 9 legendary among 5 toons . Fuck I’m not looking forward to that
[6:51:42] AstaganDave: I bought the top pack the other day
[6:51:43] Kyrrua: that first trailer really was the starting point of the global hype
[6:51:46] JeffsStolenBike: Felwood is just the edges of the mountains, literally just finised it
[6:51:47] Aidler: is Amazon is behind Ark and New World they will make sure those games will not compete against each other

[6:52:17] Nottinghams: Nah modz doesn't do YT
[6:52:17] Reckless_Monk: he does
[6:52:24] gfield2k: @CadzFPS You are correct. But that still doesn't negate the fact, they are going to be paying top viewing streamer to play it
[6:52:25] Holysal: he dont do youtube
[6:52:43] gfield2k: @Towelliee I have a map for your herbing paths can i link it
[6:52:51] CADZtv: @gfield2k well obv but doesnt mean they arent interested in it all either right
[6:53:02] TanaseOS: WoW has been clinically dead for a while now, the only thing keeping it "alive" is peoples' sunk cost fallacy, don't fool yourselves

[6:53:29] Shadowlemur01: that looks like PoE
[6:53:34] Armdel: looks like class trailers
[6:53:42] Aidler: has the video many views? if not it might have flown below the radar so far…..
[6:53:45] Holysal: @Shadowlemur01 its a mmo
[6:53:47] CADZtv: @gfield2k i mean your statement was a reach to just cause they big

[6:54:53] AceOfTheNorth: I mean the gameplay looks interesting, but really the huge thing about these games is all the non-combat stuff.
[6:55:06] ihatevnecks: Combat is closer to isometric BDO
[6:55:07] AceOfTheNorth: Diablo looks great, but wears out really fast.
[6:55:11] CADZtv: @gfield2k same thing could be said about towe being paid for it iswell
[6:55:20] WarhoundUK: why do none of these companies release anything remotely similar to wow tho? i still wanna play the orcs and shit im just sick of blizzards lack of fucks to give
[6:55:23] Aidler: @llexpert Ark
[6:55:24] mikejames01: @CadzFPS Just cause he does not have a sub doe not mean he can make apoint grow up
[6:55:26] Vigi9413: What caused the PoE hype to die off?
[6:55:27] InsomniousGames: they just announced a raid that will take 3 days or more to complete
