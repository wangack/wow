[1:39:40] DeanoTV: @Zeakon92 ok ty
[1:39:44] wowaddonsez: if talents and spells are working, and they are testing outlands, how long until prepatch? prepatch doesnt need outland testing
[1:39:50] Eternaalll: u got stung by a scorpion? :D
[1:39:57] Zeakon92: @DeanoTV  oh, feral druid btw, not as much auto attacks either as the other melee
[1:39:59] Gizimoo86: yeah those bc servers are dusty overheating and crashing a lot
[1:40:02] mogrann66: So jealous you got the invite.  It seems like I never get into the betas:( guess that is because I am just an average player
[1:40:05] tbbex_: guess who's in the hospital after having some even worse symptoms after the 2nd dose. ME
[1:40:07] PadidinJones: That fire glow is waaay too intense
[1:40:08] Mitune: hearth otherwise it is a wasted bubble.
[1:40:20] Vexxsis: @deanotv all melee classes will auto attack , but your also weaving class abilities
[1:41:00] MrGM: addons when?
[1:41:00] igor93: Will JC be available in pre patch to @Towelliee ?
[1:41:01] LSBreed: no add on to load

[1:41:48] Secondbreakfasttt: towRee Kappa
[1:41:49] Mavrek93: can you lvl to 70 in beta or is it capped?
[1:41:49] wowaddonsez: if outlands is being tested, doesnt that mean prepatch could be soon?
[1:41:57] PadidinJones: "I know a guy!"
[1:42:07] igor93: @Mavrek93 64 i think
[1:42:09] Blistz1: wait, so it confirms you know Ion then
[1:42:11] tbbex_: @Mavrek93 Temp. capped at 64 but they'll be slowly raising it
[1:42:13] PrOFuSiioN: I'm not even lvl 60 yet lol so doesn't bother me that I don't have access to beta
[1:42:14] ShadoodHD: ohhhh i seeee
[1:42:18] theszoti: what do you think will come first TBC or 9.1?
[1:42:24] ShadoodHD: okay so who'd be the best -- j/k
[1:42:40] Attackroot: i lost my friends and family when my uncle passed. he was on the team when they were working on vanilla back in the day

[1:43:28] MOLAR305: you can buy a tesla with bitcoin now lol
[1:43:30] Kinghorn: good morning towHi
[1:43:33] PadidinJones: The drop rate is annoying AF for this quest
[1:43:36] Vexxsis: @falldrgn most likely dual spec will come
[1:43:43] Mitune: These first slew of quest always felt so much harder than anything after them
[1:43:47] tbbex_: @Zeakon92 It'll probably come in prepatch so people can lvl to 60 before tbc launches
[1:43:50] iamjo3l: @theszoti tbc... 9.1 rumored august
[1:44:00] trickywalrus__: 4 per portal
[1:44:04] tbbex_: @In1gomontoya I hurt Mid-July
[1:44:05] CritcobainTV: POGGERS

[1:45:27] iunbearable: This year seems its flying
[1:45:28] SmokedHog: how much did that USB mic cost? that USB mic actually sounded decent / almost better
[1:45:32] LSBreed: haha @primeeqt
[1:45:34] Truckergut: Buff Wisdom instead of sanc, most the damage you're taking is fire anyways. Also look into specing into Sancity Aura for 10% more holy damage. Holy shield is weak until you have more block anyways.
[1:45:35] WhiteKnight74648: So you are saying you are not prepared?

[1:46:37] Wulfgrym: laminate
[1:46:42] Ribbwich: @Towelliee rent an air bnb
[1:46:45] neverbornlucky: towelliee is putting a mac donalds in his room

[1:47:53] elchaposkjelbo: belf male got hella attitude when they runnin/attackin in BC KEKW
[1:48:03] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee I assume you approve of the possible store mount for tbc?
[1:48:03] CritcobainTV: Correct
[1:48:22] eziz86: i think bliz need do more exp or nerf exp level
[1:48:22] CritcobainTV: You put it in front of you so the sound waves don't bounce all around
[1:48:23] d3admangaming: @Towelliee yup I have an 80lbs American Bulldog I had real wood in the house it is now in the trash after 7 years it was toast and yeas I had it re-surfaces but it just gets torn up just as quick

[1:48:42] Aaradin: I think his gf plays video games in the next room over when he streams
[1:48:43] CritcobainTV: Speaking of sponsors
[1:48:43] andre_j2: you put sound proofing on all walls
[1:48:50] its_andyd: most people who get sound proof panels have no idea how they work
[1:48:53] Shamwise: You should have Origin build out your command center
[1:48:56] Chasery: that's pretty standard for sound dampening to reduce reverb, yeah?
[1:49:01] SmokedHog: if you have hard floors, sound echoes. when you swtich from carpet to hard you will need sound dampeners probably in front of you, in the corners, and behind you
[1:49:49] CritcobainTV: Do you guys need to get hyped up? Get ready for those all nighters when Classic TBC launches by using code "Towel" at the check out when you order Gfuel. it's basically the equivalent of going into TBC with full T3. POGGERS

[1:51:47] FatChase: catJAM
[1:51:50] zSKIz1: Is paladin leveling having a hunter do everything?
[1:51:53] Mecabeast: i think you soundproof towards where you speak to lessen echos back to the mic. but im just guessing
[1:51:56] Eternaalll: @Towelliee does your mic have a built in popfilter?
[1:51:57] LSBreed: I'm out of mana

[1:52:43] raldrik: I feel like these Pally animations are better than retail
[1:52:48] BeastaH: avenger shield is booboo
[1:53:09] tbbex_: the wave 3 also has a built in pop filter
[1:53:27] TheUnknowing: carpet sucks and is annoying to deal with

[1:53:36] agderrico: Carpet sucks
[1:53:42] ChrisStoll: carpet gets gross. With hardwood, you can atleast sweep up the crumbs
[1:53:43] agderrico: Does not look as clean

[1:53:49] agderrico: Are you going hardwood?
[1:53:55] Boomcity_: @Towelliee i'm current leveling a pally in classic for the first time... this is rough solo

[2:23:28] Kinghorn: if they want to make a good first impression for people, giving them that shit gear and sending them to outland is going to get people to quit real quick

[2:24:31] kpt58: @Kinghorn its a weird balance though.  A lot of people quit classic because it was too easy compared to modern games.
[2:24:33] lieutenantdan416: correct you get 1 fee boost
[2:24:44] Primeqty: @Towelliee isnt it gona be scuffed with everyone trying to do the same quests at the same time ?

[2:25:18] SonofHorus82: @obelisk1151 yeah it's a paid boost. Technically there has never been a free boost, since they were all locked behind buying an xpac or the actual boost itself in the shop.
[2:25:29] lieutenantdan416: @Holysal ya they charge fee my english sucks

[2:46:52] Boab: Are you playing blood elf paladin cause they are better or are you just wanting to play horde?
[2:46:53] pokerigo: they fell lol
[2:47:10] Duecifer: @towelliee the earliest good sword is the spell fire Longsword in slave pens from the totem dropping boss. also at the last half of hellfire there's a quest with a green if I remember correctly.
[2:47:11] themaliciousrabbit: @Boab he's horde

[2:50:06] ATV93: i feel like there are no tanks and pally tanking is just so satisying
[2:50:17] kaladincho: PVE in tbc maybe is one of the greatest :D
[2:50:19] albertocofi: when does paly get the refilling of mana from healing? TBC or LK?
[2:50:20] drRoswell: hellfire is easy af seen soda do it all boses gets melted

[3:02:00] Whitemamba236: The argument against it tho is that they will add many more microtransactions which will hurt the game
[3:02:08] zenFX_: People were begging for blizzard to add stuff to classic that was going to be implemented but never was originally, now they added the phase mount which was going to be originally implemented into TBC and everyone is up in arms. Make your minds up people LUL
[3:02:11] Mazemouse: I don't even care about the store bought mounts. Don't like em? Don't buy em! Just stick with the normal ingame available mounts. Nobody is forcing you :)

[3:04:43] warrenny: @simplysylvan Exactly get your priorities in order
[3:04:50] Moxgoat: If they are including a mount (and other things) in a deluxe version of a game that is supposed to come free with your sub, isn't that a microtransaction?

[3:04:55] Eternaalll: @Towelliee yes the one portal with some kinda eye.
