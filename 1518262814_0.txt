[1:38:51] klonken123: no im p sure they already have an idea @tedol
[1:39:06] tedol: maybe
[1:39:26] silodin: no transmog = ancient
[1:39:35] CritcobainTV: I made a warlock for wotlk, FelGibson @Towelliee  KEKW
[1:39:36] king_julian_96: i thought claasic does'nt become retail till cata
[1:39:47] tedol: transmog is cata or mop?
[1:39:51] king_julian_96: and that beign the reason they will never have a cata classic
[1:40:16] Klutar: people forget that lots of the things people say they hate about current wow came in wotlk
[1:40:23] CritcobainTV: my goal for first 2 weeks is to have rogue and paladin at 80
[1:40:32] CritcobainTV: @Klutar like what?
[1:40:34] NieIas: @tedol cata

[1:40:45] tedol: if they will rework Deathwing , yea, cata classic will be good
[1:40:56] masenka_: this is the best levelling experience they evert did imo. Best balance of story, atmosphere and enough freedom of exploration.
[1:41:09] klonken123: @Towelliee  Northrend best looking zones /vibes overall imo. THoughts ?
[1:41:11] Bayne77: thow the bag on it
[1:41:25] Alepouditsa: HeyGuys
[1:42:31] raukase: grizzly hills, sholazar best ones in wotlk
[1:42:31] CritcobainTV: Grizzy Hills BiS
[1:42:33] silodin: yeah well.. that's like, your opinion dude
[1:42:34] CritcobainTV: best music
[1:42:34] Nico_vdM: People love(d) Grizzly Hills
[1:42:36] xmedpakx: big fan of howling fjord and stormpeaks
[1:42:40] Ahtilah: Grizzly Hills, one of my favorites still
[1:42:40] klonken123: i mean as a package. What exspansion had the best overall zones in your opinion ?
[1:42:54] antori_92: what zone has the best music?
[1:42:56] silodin: i'd say cata tbh
[1:43:01] Klutar: @Klutar lfd, easier raids, nearly everything soloable, easy rep grinds, basic rotations, easier to gear etc
[1:43:04] Menion01: Why did people complain about LFD?
[1:43:14] tedol: what was the most right one zone called, with mountain giants, that one is very cute zone

[1:44:47] tedol: just more people has memories about it
[1:44:54] Dystilled: Eh, I played since Vanilla, WOTLK was just a damn good expansion, the raiding was fresh and fun, but always a challenge
[1:44:58] king_julian_96: since this is probably where classic end what do you think they goign to do after wrath finally do a classic plus or do a cata classic
[1:44:59] klonken123: i didnt even play in wrath , i just love the vibe in Northrend. Lore was cool. Really good soundtrack.
[1:45:04] Cafe0le: i prefer the feel of the zones in wrath tbh, zones in recent expansions feel like a theme park made with worldquests in mind
[1:45:43] Naethix: I cant wait for Wrath
[1:46:06] klonken123: i feel that. Content in the new zones feel empty
[1:46:27] klonken123: you only go there because shiny map tells u , not because its organic
[1:47:07] Dystilled: Venomspite is that gothic village in the SW isnt it?
[1:47:38] Nico_vdM: Wasnt venomspite the are below the alliance area (next to naxxramas)

[1:47:45] Nico_vdM: the horde area*
[1:47:54] NieIas: i hope that mindset has changed now..
[1:47:56] tedol: Isn't LFG last patch for Wrath?
[1:47:58] klonken123: kinda insane how htey doubled down on covenants
[1:48:04] paperzino: Is it copium to think WoW is starting to turn around for the better? I think Blizzard is actually starting to listen
[1:48:10] tedol: oh
[1:48:29] Toasti0: I liked covenants. the balancing was horrendous
[1:48:34] zenFX_: ulduar hard mode progression made obsolete by a pointless raid
[1:48:34] lucidakamaze: i like that tho, RDF feel bad @ launch. If its added in ulduar or in ToC it will be more of a carchup system.
[1:48:38] OnlyJonz: do u have to level a new character in wrath or can u play ur tbc character ?
[1:48:44] king_julian_96: and then they can do cata classic
[1:48:47] Bayne77: southeast
[1:48:48] Cafe0le: @klonken123 it is a very cohesive continent (besides cystalsong), zones trransition very well into each other
[1:48:52] Turet78: more down
[1:48:56] klonken123: @paperzino  i feel like theyve kinda done this before lmao. BFA azerite stuff , they did end up going back on that kinda.
[1:48:58] Nico_vdM: That is the green area on the coast not fully discovered
[1:49:06] Bayne77: southish from the undead camp
[1:49:18] tedol: haha, nope
[1:49:22] klonken123: @Cafe0le  also very unique from wows other zones imo.
[1:49:49] tedol: there are a lot dragons in this area, most likely
[1:50:47] Just_Jaybles: isnt the big bones in the middle galagrond?
[1:50:52] Nico_vdM: Towelliee, Venomspike is east of Wyrmrest Temple below Wintergarde Keep and on the way to Naxx
[1:50:53] Deex93: galakrond died here right? he is probably the bad guy of dragonflight
[1:51:14] Turet78: What you think how advanced will be the alpha when we can play with it? Full Dragon Isles, Evoker, professions in or just maybe the new talents in the first build nothing more?
[1:51:19] tedol: oh,my
[1:51:20] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[2:04:51] paperzino: @Auirex depends man do you want a fast character or a slower playstyle
[2:05:07] paperzino: probably just make a trial of each one and see which is better
[2:05:27] Auirex: @Auirex Fast character tbh. Fury warrior was really fun
[2:05:41] paperzino: then monk
[2:06:08] Sleyla: be aware that energy based class (like monk) won't feel as viceral as warr
[2:06:12] Dystilled: I would have stopped pulling 3 pulls in if that guy was in my party

[2:12:46] nooh55: pref classic never ends with wrath zones as all 60 zones

[2:23:26] NewWorldReign: Yeah, then the Ebon Hold broke free of the Lich Kings command just the same as Sylvanas and the Undead. I guess Sylvans was already working for the Jailer when Arthas turned her into a banshee.

[2:24:41] Rudric_Ice: more HP and it hits harder.......
[2:24:49] emilools: they basically have to add more mechanics and increase tuning
[2:24:56] Fappy23: mythic dungeons coming for wrath too? Pog
[2:25:31] PadidinJones: I dont think there is any difference in Heroic as far as mechanics go besides mobs having more health and hit harder
[2:25:45] Rudric_Ice: do Oculus Kappa

[2:27:40] mwchaos: wrath as it was, was just fine no changes needed
[2:27:57] PadidinJones: back then the devs were the filthy casuals @Towelliee
[2:28:06] FrozenShades: @mwchaos Probably gonna be the last one, maybe a Cata one ?
[2:28:10] Rudric_Ice: they want to make wrath SOM from the get go Kappa
[2:28:26] iceproxx: yeah make game more like retail so it dies within first month
[2:28:29] emilools: im actually totally fine with them making changes. classic would have done so much better with changes as well, there wasnt a meta back in vanilla, as there is now. this needs to be accounted for
[2:28:31] Dystilled: From what I've seen of you playing this so far, this 'classic' seems WAY easier than the original Wrath. To the point it doesn't look any challenge at all
[2:28:45] flamekaster: inside
[2:28:50] flamekaster: and down
[2:29:06] Thoreya: @Dystilled regular wrath was easy af also
[2:29:16] Chrizzor13: its inside :D
[2:29:26] Sh4nti: The dungeon is inside
[2:29:32] emilools: ulduar hardmodes and icc hc were challenging @Thoreya
[2:29:46] Thoreya: im saying this stuff
[2:29:58] Bayne77: huge pulls.  i remember
[2:29:59] Dystilled: Yeah, but early levels arent really made to be hard for full sunwell etc
[2:30:05] FrozenShades: wasnt wrath a cake walk until Ulduar?
[2:30:49] Dystilled: the first 50% of an expansions levels SHOULD really be easy enough that you can do it levelling 1-that level without raiding.
[2:31:00] Sh4nti: Even when we were in LK quest greens/blues, it was still no-CC mega pulls from what I remember
[2:31:05] Dystilled: Otherwise new players would be screwed

[2:32:54] Sh4nti: I think Ulduar was the perfect balance, normal for casuals and HM for sweaty peeps

[2:33:24] FrozenShades: Heroic, yes.

[2:37:35] Rudric_Ice: what if they implemented that system now in retail with RWF guilds KEKW
[2:37:51] gitcrit: sounds sick!
[2:38:41] asmodai4823: limited attempts wont matter this time around ppl will storm the raids day 1
[2:38:52] Dystilled: I think a lot of WoWs player base are probably people that played in their early 20s 10 yrs ago, who now have life commitments, I doubt that system would go down well today
[2:39:00] Armdel: wouldn't work nowadays i think, they would have to make the bosses too easy and guilds would clear it in probably less than 50 attempts anyway
[2:39:32] PadidinJones: @Towelliee at the end of the day, someone is always gunna be pissed about the changes made/not made here
[2:39:53] gitcrit: Didn't people also like cheat the fight with LK
[2:40:22] Dystilled: Big guilds cheated the LK and got bans yes
[2:41:28] Sh4nti: @Towelliee real question is will they let saronite bomb be used or nah :D
[2:41:42] almostdps: i feel like the fresh servers will be dead before the 90 day min transfer thing even hits
[2:41:55] Rudric_Ice: the guilds were using an addon which made the fight really easy and then it got banned

[3:05:20] LesterLinton: will towelliee be able to show us the invoker class in alpha tho?
[3:05:23] Kakotan2143: I think they need to make the base game to be free but you can only level up to a certain level now that it is lvl cap of 70 with dragon flight, maybe make it lvl 35 , cant trade gold, can only use up to 12 slot bags and can only have half the bank space and other limits like that @Towelliee

[5:20:53] BrothaLatinoHeat76: So any idea when WotLK Classic will be going live?
[5:20:59] Timothious: does fresh server mean everyone starting out at level 1?
[5:21:29] Kisswani: hasn't been there a lot of builds being deployed internally ?
[5:21:34] Kisswani: recently
[5:21:36] Destroyer1v1: Yes @timothious
[5:22:46] Kisswani: right
[5:23:11] ehugo90: woltk:pala
[5:23:22] mmrghost7: old gods summon the alpha  :/
[5:23:32] Kisswani: I saw a data miner today say that the dragon Isles are the same size as Northrend . for 5 zones to be as big as Northrend the zones have to be massive
[5:23:39] unstoppablelv: SirPrise SirSword SirShield
[5:24:34] jarilrpg: @Kisswani i believe that was said in an interview, T&E mentioned it on stream the other day also
[5:25:13] Kisswani: @jarilrpg I must have missed that , thx for pointing it out
[5:25:25] Mecabeast: 15 minute flight paths from one 3nd of the c9ntinent to the other kekw
[5:26:10] Korupcija_: hopefully it wont be tedious like not having whistle in SL
[5:26:20] PToastman: will druids get a dragon rider form?
[5:26:27] DrkPhoenix6913: I wanna see how the dragon riding ends up annoying people in the long run - because flying game...
[5:26:32] Allemongo: I think dragon training will look similar to ZM upgrades
[5:26:55] DirtyBeef2134: DirtyBeef2134 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hoping for WOTLK prepatch or preorders soon. Then DF Alpha.
[5:27:26] jarilrpg: @DrkPhoenix6913 look and see how its received in GW2, that is a very similar system to dragon riding in DF

[5:27:51] raldrik: I just worry that open world gamers are not going to have any way to grind any power increases
[5:27:52] DrkPhoenix6913: @jarilrpg admittedly, i know nothing about GW2
[5:28:05] luravi: you ran passed one
[5:28:18] jarilrpg: @DrkPhoenix6913 same, just heard people mention that it is a very similar system
[5:28:27] mavericks312: the later S4 is the more we know DF gets delayed
[5:28:31] BoezIRL: wrath or beta?
[5:28:34] DirtyBeef2134: wrath prepatch will come before season 4. Fresh servers. Going to have to give a solid month I feel for the fresh to level up before WOTLK drops
[5:29:01] mayonaes: i am pretty excited we get the transmog helms from amazon prime
[5:29:16] mayonaes: I always wanted the red one

[5:30:34] Kisswani: yeah , great Lore in this area
[5:30:47] YomiShious: Is it just me who feels its a bad idea to release wrath and DF during the same year? I thought when classic originally came out they were gonna release old expacs on the off years
[5:31:26] The_Dane_Train: True but people don‚Äôt want content droughts in classic.
[5:31:27] mavericks312: @yoby the time DF releases wrath will probably be in the ulduar waiting room
[5:31:31] careyeve36: nobody remembers the peasants :(
[5:32:16] mavericks312: 90% of players believe DF gets delayed
[5:32:20] mayonaes: DF will release this year
[5:32:22] mayonaes: fo sho
[5:32:38] AwesomesauceAsh: 22  Nov when 1st exp was released
[5:32:40] AwesomesauceAsh: :P
[5:32:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: With 100 more devs, Dragonflight could really be this year
[5:32:46] mayonaes: I am getting that 100% uncut hopium
[5:33:08] mayonaes: more devs does not equal faster development
[5:33:08] Poriand: Let‚Äôs not forget about Arclight Rumble lol
[5:33:19] taintalizerx: thats alot of training in a short time
[5:33:19] mavericks312: @wEiRdO_dUdE those devs arent touching DF till atleast .2 patch
[5:33:22] Stonefather: Those 100 people aren't touching prelaunch dragonflight they would have to be onboarded and that takes time
[5:33:38] The_Dane_Train: It takes 3 months before a new employee is up to speed.
[5:33:38] szble: funny didnt they just hire more staff
[5:33:38] stabzmcgeee: @mayonaes who's your hopium dealer,,, i need a new one :)
[5:33:45] Eithos87: @Towelliee we both know df wont be this year. what do I say to my friends that believe it will be this year?
[5:33:53] mayonaes: @stabzmcgeee i got you
[5:33:54] Mecabeast: let's just hope they don't draenor this expansion with the new hires
[5:33:58] andrewmb01: dranor was good
[5:33:59] Kriven: plus you go through onboarding and all that stuff with how blizzard handles policy and you gotta get up to speed
[5:34:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: @mavericks312 The WoWhead article said the extra people have been helping since May and they are working on Dragonflight
[5:34:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: get to work, you have 6 months
[5:34:17] atrexy_: does pala have so much mana problems in LK ?
[5:34:20] mavericks312: mike doesnt seem like the type of guy to throw ppl in the fire day 1
[5:34:26] the_hoff_man: and 2more classes
[5:34:28] the_hoff_man: Kappa
[5:34:29] ronny_84: they will be working on the basic stuff
[5:34:30] Bayne77: 13 new classes
[5:34:31] PToastman: Towelliee confirmed

[5:34:41] Blah206: Don't forget the Battle Royale shuffle

[5:34:48] planelman: productive*
[5:34:54] The_Dane_Train: New people slows the existing people down for a bit while train them.
[5:34:55] XarkoLP: DF will have 10 more Raids cuz of the peeps Kappa
[5:34:56] LAXNESS: danCopium surely its gonna be great danCopium
[5:34:57] stabzmcgeee: new devs need atleast 6 months to get thier head around wow spaghetti code

[5:35:23] Mecabeast: ion going to be white haired and bloodshot eyes by the time the 100 people get through training
[5:35:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Put the new people on the centaurs! Let's roll
[5:35:31] tee_rekts: 100 Staff Hired -- 96 project managers -- 3 Devs - 1 QA
[5:35:32] a23pk: Shadow life

[5:36:41] Stonefather: That would be pretty cool if we didn't know what was happening Keepo
[5:36:42] HowFastSonicFast: good
[5:36:48] Mecabeast: dey took our jobs
[5:36:52] mavericks312: you think they test half the raid again and test the other half themselves
[5:36:56] Kisswani: fuck that , keep the cinematics encrypted , give me everything else
[5:36:56] Korupcija_: fuck that, I want to beat the game before it comes out
[5:37:01] PToastman: endwalker would have been so much worse if we all knew before it launched how it was gonna go
[5:37:12] stabzmcgeee: im down for no alpha/beta testing and just send it when its ready
[5:37:17] Turet78: I personally don't care if it's encrypted let me play with it explore and do fun stuff with the talents and the Evoker
[5:38:00] Thoreya: they gotta test out solo qqqqqq
[5:38:02] Thoreya: hype

[5:38:25] Forestrunner201: < Senior Software Engineer and ex-Dev Team Manager (Not for Blizzard though) Can answer some industry questions
[5:38:36] Mecabeast: so i know they said beyond wrath it's up to the community what if we had m+ in classic?
[5:39:10] IVJamieIV: @stabzmcgeee How will they know when it's ready? the beta is part of that process for them as they don't have the resources to fully test internally. It's all about saving money.

[5:41:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Crit sounds good
[5:41:11] IVJamieIV: @stabzmcgeee That's a very surface level view of what the beta test is about.

[5:42:51] emznev: world quests in shadowlands was so bad , Done bfa world quests every day for 2 years
[5:42:58] stabzmcgeee: @IVJamieIV im guessing at some point i should have put /sarcasm
[5:43:09] mavericks312: if that world content team hits a home run give them a raise
[5:43:24] Angxlic: dragonflight needs content other than raiding and m+. Lost ark does it best
[5:43:25] Kisswani: yeah , no more WQ 2.0 please
[5:43:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: World content should be better this time, yeah
[5:43:54] lithium364: please dont be korthia or the maw LUL
[5:43:56] mavericks312: i still expect WQ's to be a thing but give us new shit on top of it
[5:43:58] Furinax: what did you just say? I just came in?
[5:44:11] YomiShious: they need to be looking at eso and gw2 for how they approach world content. Imo they handle it extremely well
[5:44:14] paravak: Also go back to emissary quests instead of callings, that was such a backward step in design and player convenience
[5:44:19] darthturtle1031: do you think they will do a battle royal style thing?
[5:44:20] ydokthegreat: Borrowed power sucks imo
[5:44:21] aladinsane444: New World in wow ? Pog
[5:44:42] mavericks312: @paravak idk man callings made you hella gold though
[5:44:46] Kisswani: give us a scenario like withered training but for a whelpling army

[5:45:15] Kriven: really hoping the professions system is good tailoring has felt useless forever
[5:45:25] paravak: @mavericks312 True they do, but you can still give those gold rewards without having to go to your sanctum to pick up the quest for it first
[5:45:26] Turet78: Maybe Dragonflight will be the purest WoW experience in a long time can't wait to see it.
[5:45:28] Chaosruler: I actually liked Legion tbh, the whole artifact weapon concept was cool and the upgrades.
[5:45:35] neugassh: nw servers will be shut down in 2-3 months
[5:45:50] emznev: @neugassh no they wont tf lol

[5:46:36] Kisswani: make it useful for us casuals , I doubt it'll ever be fully useful for mythic raiding end game
[5:46:40] mavericks312: they need to make sure higher end players arent the only ones running the market for professions

[5:46:50] Mecabeast: it only lasts like the first week
[5:46:50] andrewmb01: I just think they need to make gear accessable that actually is usefull
[5:46:50] Kriven: @vulkankragon no wildstar had endgame lol it was just to insane
[5:46:54] theviperleet: so you want a sword made for a goldcap now if only one prson can make it andd its good?
[5:47:03] Eithos87: by the end of the first month everyone will be crafting everything
[5:47:03] Timothious: then by the time it drops it isnt worth it

[5:47:22] Blah206: Kreygasm
[5:47:22] Allemongo: then those people quit and those items are gone forever KEKW
[5:47:28] mavericks312: hell ill be just happy if the gear is viable in raids alone
[5:47:28] Kisswani: yeah and you have to buy 15 tokens to afford , coz that Blacksmith is an a-hole
[5:47:42] ydokthegreat: Not crazy. That's a good thing.
[5:47:45] andrewmb01: they need to do better then classic
[5:47:47] Korupcija_: gear is boring imo, need some cool stats/effects
[5:47:48] lithium364: the blacksmith bc weaons were an good example
[5:47:51] Chrizzor13: look at newwolrd, profs  were a giga grind, and the whole server just did it,
[5:47:53] mavericks312: i havent used tailoring gear in a raid since BC
[5:47:53] andrewmb01: or BFA type crafting
[5:47:54] emznev: @Kisswani 15? you mean about 30 kekw
[5:47:57] ydokthegreat: You shouldn't have to get an entire set of gear ever patch.
[5:47:59] MrFuzzynuts420: i just don't want pvp gear being 10 ilvl higher than mythic gear like it is now

[5:48:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like 5 points in each tree is just buying back baseline abilities > <
[5:48:36] andrewmb01: they might as well just take crafting out of the game b
[5:48:39] paravak: @mavericks312 I liked going to the sanctum when I wanted to go to the sanctum, but if I spawn at oribos and see there's a calling for WQ in Maldraxxus I just want to go there and do the WQs instead of having to go to Bastion only to pick up the quest first
[5:48:41] Piztol_Whip: Do you think Blizzard understands the stakes of this expansion this time around ? @towelliee
[5:48:46] Eithos87: they would need to make outside guides illegal
[5:48:52] emznev: BFA was better than shadowlands :)

[5:49:37] neugassh: nothing wrong with borrowed power but the acquisition of it
[5:49:41] instant_savage: i would love borrowed power back, but it has to bw good and worth the grind like legion ap, not like renowm or azerite power

[5:50:28] sh4d0wsky: good ol' days of wotlk and wow in general
[5:50:43] Blah206: @mavericks312 true
[5:50:46] andrewmb01: azerite and the powers on gear was garbage @mavericks312
[5:50:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked infinite grind systems, but I can't see them doing azerite power again anytime soon
[5:51:10] Kisswani: stalker alert monkaS
[5:51:22] mavericks312: @PumpItPal i disagree in bfa i actually played more then 45 minutes a day
[5:51:37] andrewmb01: that doesn't mean it was good @mavericks312
[5:51:43] Zippaya: more than legion?
[5:51:46] Mecabeast: bfa and shadoelands are about even for me
[5:51:47] andrewmb01: time played doesn't = good
[5:51:51] caboose1029: BFA is my 2nd favorite xpac
[5:51:52] kokochris: I liked BFA. not my fav of all time, but fun.  Legion was my fav
[5:51:55] mrniceguy817: Bfa for me was bottom tier
[5:51:57] andrewmb01: something blizzard should figure out :D
[5:51:58] jskillz777: hi towel
[5:52:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: azerite gear was interesting but wasnt worth losing tier sets
[5:52:14] mavericks312: bfa is a top 4 xpac
[5:52:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Things like a "roster system" with account-wide "paragon" levels could maybe happen, I would like it
[5:52:16] Rudric_Ice: most played doesn't mean it's good but I will say it was fun when they introduced corruptions
[5:52:17] paravak: @mavericks312 Yeah that could work, but emissary quests just skipped there being a quest in the log entirely and had it just be a turn in which is just more convenient.
[5:52:23] Zippaya: I like that borough power grind
[5:52:31] Kisswani: here we go POGGERS

[5:53:14] Xvizan: im excited
[5:53:21] andrewmb01: @Rudric_Ice massively changing the game in the middle of the game doesn't make me interested

[6:30:57] Borzlox: i was younger and worse at the game back during wrath, but i do remember it being pretty slow
[6:30:59] lomja1: warmane is x7 xp
[6:31:05] zeitgeiz: They should lower time it takes to level by a lot. Nobody cares about it now. Would have so many players if they did that.
[6:31:06] TmT_eh: warmane is 7x on the seasonal sever by default. You can turn it down though but no point

[6:35:00] Baladore: @Xvizan with the hate they are getting, they should.
[6:35:17] N3llee: Sorry first level 80 hunter on the server*
[6:35:21] Orion280: they full on developed a new LFG tool no way they are budging for a while

[6:39:06] acebrown24: I hate tetail
[6:39:11] acebrown24: retail
[6:39:16] Anoia22: what they could do is a LFG but not porting to the entrance of the dungeon. This will help get comunication from the people for summon whatever they need.
[6:39:37] lecrabTV: i think they could meet in the middle on lfg at least. make it form your group automatically but not tele you to the dungeon or something
[6:40:28] Mecabeast: it's better than the joke of a group finder in tbc classic
[6:40:30] szble: people want to use summoning stones that bad?
[6:40:39] lecrabTV: i don't see that group finder being any better than it is now in tbcc, no one uses it they just install lfg bulletin board to parse lfg chat
[6:40:39] Orion280: LFG isnt a bad tool people are just bad
[6:40:43] lobstertechgaming: what on the menu big hauss
[6:40:47] N3llee: yea gearscore got real bad in wrath
[6:40:47] vic_ave: you can already use summoning stones
[6:40:51] ZiggyJZ_: I could be wrong but didn't they make it LFG but you couldn't tele to the dungeon? You still have to run?

[6:41:28] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[6:41:37] Katalystgb: u cant talk in LFG unless you're in the new group finder tho
[6:41:44] DeleldurTV: Thats the thing you CAN NOT post in lfg chatt UNLESS you are signed up witth this tool
[6:41:46] readyvic: Why cant we have both for choice
[6:41:53] neugassh: well you have to list yourself in lfg to be able to write in lfg channel
[6:42:16] xqus: wouldn't people just use /world still?
[6:42:28] metavahn231: bulletin board worked so well, i hope people just keep it simple
[6:42:47] Borzlox: wouldn't the "ideal" compromise be to have the new group finder but add an opt-in feature for group assignment if you're not picky/just want a group
[6:42:51] lobstertechgaming: doesnt this version have a alt spec switch or something ?
[6:42:55] lecrabTV: @xqus that's not a default channel and people can hijack it and password protect it lol

[6:45:39] MR_WYTE: lul like getting denied for a +15 key at 3k io. smh
[6:45:44] Katalystgb: Theres potential to lose more players from exclusion with the new tool, than just using random dungeon finder
[6:45:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: people will spend 30 minutes finding the perfect group to complete the 15 minute dungeon

[6:56:26] Borzlox: @Blvdman WoD but with the content they originally cut
[6:56:32] Baladore: @Baladore Cause they ruined the game, which they are doing now with wotlk.

[7:02:09] king_julian_96: and iam sure if asmon gets the invite to dragonflight alpha he will play that aswell
[7:02:17] tronbadgames: sonny played lenny the pimp in SOA
[7:02:32] tronbadgames: Hells Angels OG
[7:02:54] Xvizan: @Baladore sounds right. they should just stop classic creation at WOTLK fix their mistake they made this time around by just killing all the other xpacs
[7:02:54] Cafe0le: @Baladore classes, pvp and raids only get better after wrath
[7:03:19] Baladore: @Baladore Tell that to the player base that left after wrath.
[7:03:19] Frank4LuLz: Hells Angel founding fathe, on SOA too
[7:03:22] Scoodles91: well you kinda have to download it, so you can finish it :D
[7:03:30] Velashen: Let‚Äôs not get too crazy here. I think there are a lot of us that will not play a cata classic including myself.
[7:03:47] cahoots82: None of ya'll gonna change Baladore's opinion. Just let him have it and be sad their ruining the game again.
[7:03:55] baloo_the_bear_: I'd love a Classic+ experience after Wrath, but I dont think Blizzard has the appetite for it. Maybe Mircrosoft will.
[7:03:56] emznev: asmons chat are a bunch of 8 year old children
[7:04:13] Sielu11628: Gratz, MrGM!
[7:04:52] Baladore: @cahoots82 Yes, I'm agreeing with those saying blizzard makes their games how they want and F' everyone else. Feelsbadman.
[7:05:24] cahoots82: @Baladore Don't assume because you don't enjoy the current iteration or plans that everyone else feels the same as you though.
[7:05:31] emznev: he put a ring on his girlfriends finger !
[7:06:02] Baladore: @cahoots82 just using the numbers like others referred too.
[7:06:24] NieIas: hopefully ^^
[7:06:53] neugassh: DF will be alpha for 2 years anyway so you have time
[7:07:13] Lasidor: 2 years of Alpha? Oh man i feel this one is super true...
[7:07:17] rensdeamo: Time between expansions and 0.5 .10, .15 will go down - Ion has said that many times
[7:07:32] cahoots82: He means it'll be in Alpha for 2 years cause it'll be a dumpster fire
[7:07:33] Frank4LuLz: July 4th weekend
[7:07:41] mavericks312: @neugassh you mistale df alpha with AoC alpha lol
[7:07:59] rensdeamo: Thats why they bought the other studio
[7:08:00] Frank4LuLz: yup surprise drop\
[7:08:13] emznev: alpha is today and you heard it here first!
[7:08:31] holyce_gaming: Im wondering how much a s4 will affect Ilvl inflation for DF
[7:08:39] neugassh: @mavericks312 nah thats min 5 years
[7:08:40] Shaele: alpha at 10, lets mark our bingo

[7:09:54] Bayne77: 10:55 all talent available 11:00 alpha drops
[7:09:54] tronbadgames: @Towelliee totally a PR move, they're not trying to have everyone nitpick all at once before they're released
[7:09:59] Frank4LuLz: they are behind bad, a slow down in the work force, thats why they bought out that new studio, for help to get back on track...we in trouble
[7:09:59] Blah206: You get a talent! And YOU get a talent!

[7:14:13] officialviz: I could have swore you and Panda did that
[7:14:41] memnon94: I bet there will be dragon riding race
[7:14:45] officialviz: Ahh okay, got it.
[7:14:47] Sielu11628: You ‚Äúthink‚Äù Dragon-riding is going to be a cool little side gig. I hope it‚Äôs weaved through the entire expansion and a huge part of it.
[7:15:29] belaham: Its going to be the only way to fly in the Dragon Isle's so it should be a huge part of it
[7:15:29] Moobot: üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[7:16:44] EitheraTV: i think it will be cool to do but nothing groundbreaking for the exp
[7:16:49] Kisswani: probably unlocking more dailies and shit as you progress through it
[7:16:56] jglymcnuts4c: As long as it‚Äôs nothing like those damn flying missions in Spyro games I‚Äôm good with it haha
[7:17:37] Velashen: If they can do dragon flying like GW2 handles mounts and the world I‚Äôm down.
[7:18:10] Diamondead1: playing DotA with this music FeelsStrongMan

[7:18:51] Sielu11628: I want the expansion to be locked behind dragon-riding. Can only access this raid or dungeon or quest area with it.  Imagine leveling through like the 3rd zone where you need it to access a campaign quest area. Pog!
[7:19:32] OG_Carroll_4L: yea alliance
[7:20:03] mavericks312: @sielu11628 you sir need to go back to classic with that atunement bullahit lol
[7:20:16] Sielu11628: KekW
[7:20:17] Armdel: i mean, as long as it is accesible by the base level dragon riding its fine i guess
[7:20:40] Kisswani: I mean , it kinda has to be a bit mandatory right ? maybe not locking serious content behind it
[7:21:00] abracka_: i hope we get some mini game with dragon riding
[7:21:09] abracka_: kinda like the MoP cloud serp
[7:21:11] Ghostpuddlez: The only dragon riding i want to do is with alexs... nvm
[7:21:16] Thoreya: i cant wait for the community to flip out about dragon riding

[7:21:18] Thoreya: gon be funnny af
[7:21:20] Velashen: Yeah it will be that way to an extent I would imagine.
[7:21:24] Armdel: well i am assuming the zones are designed so that you need to use dragon riding early on
[7:21:45] mavericks312: ngl dragon riding looks super cool

[7:24:06] Kriven: people love their mount collections so yeah
[7:24:42] Cafe0le: they said it is account wide so it doesnt matter really if some zones are gated by flying
[7:24:49] Armdel: would be cool if you got your dragon as a normal mount if you max it out, after normal flying is out that is
