[1:00:28] daconcion: idk, damage seems odd this xpac, my DK somehow takes more damage than my Hunter, despite living twice as long w/ over 60k more HP, both are DPS and within 3 ilvls of eachother, but DKs actually get Stam talents

[1:02:52] daconcion: Hunter talents are just really boring, most opf your damage and useful abilities are baseline and over the hunter tree talents are utility and the only damage talents are bottom loaded keytstones

[2:19:09] ImRayFinkle: I just dont have the talent for 10+
[2:19:10] inj0shwetrust: Infusion
[2:19:13] Crizzle777: that's where I am, stuck in the 90s
[2:19:18] Crizzle777: I am close to quitting
[2:19:28] faulen: yes
[2:19:32] TheItalianStallion321: yes
[2:19:32] faulen: you do
[2:19:33] TheItalianStallion321: in heroic
[2:19:34] kaappx: yes
[2:19:34] propoopimus: the one for 405 ya
[2:19:34] inj0shwetrust: yes
[2:19:34] PapaBerg: yes
[2:19:42] TheItalianStallion321: concentrated is mythic and 16s
[2:19:43] kappaday23: shitty ones Kappa
[2:19:45] Aquadriel: problem is primal focus, cause you cant even craft a 386 item if you dont have at least 40 focus. @Towelliee
[2:20:13] strike879: you get 4 405 upgrade items from capping renown
[2:20:14] D3m0nHunt3r666: F
[2:20:25] lawles_walrus: here's my thoughts. If they are not going to make chaos account wide and increase the amount we get per character in a week they need to nerf the amount it costs for things
[2:20:27] propoopimus: do a 20 rlp pug this week, harder than mythic bosses

[2:21:08] srze94: @propoopimus 20 rlp on fort is chill man wdym
[2:21:10] TheItalianStallion321: my problem with RLP is last boss. i still see people in 13s+ not attacking the dragon 1st which boggles my mind
[2:21:19] faulen: people think that doing 20s with no coms should be easy. That is content that need coordination and coms.
[2:21:49] evillocks: i dont understand how people on the second boss dont know how to bait the boulder away then attack the boss
[2:21:50] Crizzle777: I quit wow for a few years. My main issue with this game are the mechanics that make me keep playing. All the timegating kills me. I don't have much time to play each week
[2:21:59] dutchie76: theres a cheese for this boss to make it easier

[2:22:35] kappaday23: anyone gotten another spark for the week, if so where at after your 5th one
[2:23:19] Omni35: I don't know how keys work, do the players reach a gear item level cap or a reward plateau?
[2:23:29] propoopimus: ive run like 40 keys between my main and alts, havent seen one drop for anyone
[2:23:44] inj0shwetrust: I got one from a waking shores rare
[2:23:48] adon1sv2: its gotta be pretty rare i guess
[2:23:49] faulen: a buddy dug 100s of dirt piles and finally got onw
[2:24:06] beeannpa: Would you say prot paladin is in a good spot right now?
[2:24:09] kappaday23: alright time to dig lol
[2:24:11] Omni35: do you have to push for highest key possible, or do you stop at some point?
[2:24:43] Aquadriel: wish  got some
[2:24:55] jarilrpg: @Omni35 20 is the cap for rewards
[2:26:13] SpoofAvatar: da bears
[2:26:15] Omni35: people go a lot higher than that?
[2:26:56] ClassicMalcontent: @jarilrpg 20 is the cap for failing at or above +20 but succeeding above +20 still offers higher rewards

[2:27:27] Icyroark: they give 1.5%
[2:27:31] ninedraft317: 1.5% per bear
[2:27:42] LoseAlotLuke: you pull all 6 bears at once with the move speed buff
[2:27:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: The old bubble-taunt trick
[2:28:13] looney199725: wolfs nerfed
[2:28:15] looney199725: they do nothing now
[2:28:15] manmower: wolves easy now
[2:28:26] Omni35: asking about key rewards/loot @towelliee
[2:28:40] sipilde: These wolves man
[2:29:09] Omni35: if rewards stop at 20 keys is there any point in going higher?
[2:29:25] manmower: no
[2:29:32] looney199725: they nerfed this whole key tbh
[2:30:01] srze94: what is going on :D
[2:30:45] looney199725: its a route thing prob
[2:30:53] looney199725: u have to pull pretty big this key
[2:30:59] Aquadriel: i just did a 15 hov and as much better as it is, timer still sucky
[2:31:04] Holysal: @Omni35 unless you want a challenge
[2:31:04] CaffinatedCoffee: @Towelliee RP in a timed dungeon is BS
[2:31:25] manmower: too much running in HoV which they didn't nerf
[2:31:34] doomester: @looney199725 wht nerf they did except the RP being shorten?
[2:31:37] looney199725: u dont need clear any of this
[2:31:40] looney199725: u can skip all
[2:31:45] looney199725: @doomester nerfed all hp
[2:32:21] gassygatinho: is it bad if you are overcaping charges on blood boil as a blood dk... I find it hard to do a perfect rotation without absolutely getting smacked by mobs in m+ @towelliee
[2:32:27] doomester: @looney199725 nice, didnt know that cuz i ran it yesterday and didnt see much difference tbh :)
[2:33:21] Aquadriel: use bloodboil just a filler imo
[2:33:25] c3llout7: you only use it mostly during dance tbh
[2:33:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Generally with blood DK you keep blood boil charges rolling....to spread diseases
[2:33:41] hammack52: @Towelliee you are faster off your mount after you kill the second boss in ther
[2:33:41] gassygatinho: so it's just an aggro thing and to keep up plague on mobs
[2:34:03] Mr_O: Mr_O subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[2:34:21] papaherc: morning @Towelliee
[2:34:22] Omni35: the easiest way to figure out if an ability is good single target is going in to logs and seeing what deals the most damage on averages
[2:34:27] STEELSOUL69GAMING: also running wo mount there is faster then mounting

[2:36:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is a challenge to play Blood DK optimally, takes a lot of practice
[2:36:41] gassygatinho: would be better if they remove marrowrend and make bone shield an on use active mitigation
[2:37:03] Omni35: it gets annoying when they constantly patch stuff though
[2:37:05] gassygatinho: then you could actually use those blood boil in a rotation
[2:37:58] xXBuck: @Omni35 That is wow all the time. They have to do it from time to time

[2:38:32] Retpally9329: ret finally gets looked at and everyone has a breakdown
[2:38:33] Molvonos: You can't keep ret paladins from not attacking before the tank gets aggro.  It's just the kind of player the class/spec draws in.
[2:38:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: For Blood, Death's Caress adding 2 bone shield charges is nice; it can help you to get it up fast
[2:38:38] Molvonos: Busting that nut too early
[2:38:40] Ezekyler: i can't goito bathroom with Skovald speech now, thanks Blizzard towRage
[2:38:44] manmower: i think they need to give ret some sustained dps, lower their burst and self-healing, up their mobility a little
[2:39:06] jasonbriggs: can never keep people happy
[2:39:22] Syllvn: @manmower that's literally what they put in the blue post towComfy
[2:40:14] Omni35: I've definitely seen that on buffs and nerfs, flavor of the month guys mad they gotta reroll. I'm speaking more to big class changes multiple times in an expac

[2:40:51] jasonbriggs: awesome congrats
[2:41:11] TheCliffyShow: Odin is to much of a blowhard to have his RP skipped. He won't allow it.
[2:41:19] Raskal_Tv: Morning Everyone
[2:41:24] Molvonos: We saw a pretty massive shift in the curve going from the rest of the heroic raid to Raza.
[2:41:27] Omni35: if they keep the changes light or if you need a big change/rework I hope it's only 1 time and potentially an adjustment
[2:42:15] Elewrath: @Towelliee hey is the mouse tracker youa use a Weak aura or somthing else?
[2:42:49] gassygatinho: I just started raiding mythic with a guild that usually clears about 75% of the raid... how big of a switch would be to actually get accepted to guild that clear all every tier

[2:43:07] N3llee: feels bad having a sub and getting ads
[2:43:52] TheItalianStallion321: did you refresh after you subbed?
[2:43:57] 91Niki: @N3llee Make sure you don't have adblock enabled. That can screw with twitch even if you're subbed
[2:43:58] Molvonos: @samozadar If the guild in question is progressing and you want to jump ship to a guild that's full clear mythic, you're in for a surprise.
[2:43:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: The hardcore mythic raiding guilds are a serious investment, you gotta do all the stuff to prepare
[2:44:00] Coleyne: if you are subbed but running an ad blocker.. it interferes with the sub tag

[2:44:42] TheItalianStallion321: i have an adblocker, thats NOT the issue

[2:45:02] Teknofear64: weird, I just had "travelers log" open up. Now it's gone. I was clicking on adventure guide.
[2:45:08] Coleyne: its depends on the ad block, etc
[2:45:13] N3llee: I have an ad block but i missed that entire convo in ad hell with like 8 ads
[2:45:21] ClassicMalcontent: My ad block has rules to enable some sites such as Twitch since I'm subbed to a couple.
[2:45:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think there is an option for streamers to run ads for subs, but they usually have that turned off
[2:45:34] 91Niki: It also depends on what country you're in. I use adblock. When I am in the US, the adblock doesn't work for shit. Here in Denmark it works perfectly ijpSHRUG
[2:45:54] ArcaneMaki: I have turbo, problems solved
[2:45:56] xXBuck: That would defeat the purpose lol
[2:46:02] TheItalianStallion321: imagine forcing subs to still watch ads....no one would sub ever again

[3:08:37] ScalarGaming: big guy got pulled by a lighting bolt
[3:08:38] Drakenking: ive had multiple groups fall apart here as well, or overpulling floor 2 and the casts going crazy
[3:08:39] largefromage: ever?
[3:08:43] brettbeb2421: What is the reason for +16’s in particular? Not say 15’s or 20’s, etc.?
[3:08:50] largefromage: FeelsBadMan
[3:08:58] Shaman_Blasts: because the tank didnt put the pack wehre it belonged, he had it to close to the other packs
[3:09:01] neverbornlucky: slappy hands aren't part of the the pants ?
[3:09:01] zilzihan: yeah
[3:09:01] Bernardo994: i think chain goes everywhere
[3:09:03] LeXieSterling: Why would you even ask... You have to know you a guy that knows a guy. To be able to get a normal rub.. pull lol
[3:09:05] Shaman_Blasts: so chain lightning hopped
[3:09:08] Shaman_Blasts: very straight forward
[3:09:09] N3llee: its like hunter multi shot.. it hits what it hits
[3:09:10] Drakenking: @brettbeb2421 the overwhelming primal essences
[3:09:10] xALcaPWNedx: Well well...how the turn tables...
[3:09:16] Molvonos: Same reason Avenger's shield does occasionally
[3:09:23] Molvonos: Too close despite being not aggro
[3:09:24] Drakenking: err concentrated
[3:09:26] Drakenking: brain fart
[3:09:29] Uutef: dh glaive or avenger shield bounce as well
[3:09:29] fistofnature: @brettbeb2421 you can collect an item and when you get 10 of them you can craft 418 item
[3:09:30] RiskySaber: @brettbeb2421 You get the item to make 418 gear

[3:10:22] brettbeb2421: Has to be 16’s? That’s shitty

[3:11:20] Snabido: Class is good, but not that good KEKW
[3:11:34] RoyalFrag: okay cool cool appreciate  the info @fistofnature
[3:11:48] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they're talking about the catalyst
[3:11:51] Uutef: yoinked
[3:11:56] ArcaneMaki: Since you can only have 6 max
[3:11:57] ThePawPaw: char limit is 6

[3:14:29] Rottencoarse: *absurd
[3:14:36] 3V3R357: no, people were getting 10s of sparks on the 1st day, now you can't even loot 1
[3:14:54] TheItalianStallion321: so can someone explain this? there was a WQ for a 382 weapon on my DH. i start doing the WQ, its  epic where i have to kill mobs for % and mid WQ it changes to 300 rep. why? how? and when i finished the WQ i got no weapon. is that a fuckin bug?
[3:15:01] infektyd: brewmaster feels and is honestly very fun...
[3:15:21] cprGhost: yea a Drakonid Tank
[3:15:28] abracka_: earthwarden lets goooo
[3:15:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Might as well have a shaman tank, enhancement is kind of dorked
[3:15:43] DiranJei: aren't you a male tank rn?
[3:15:47] NierrEdits: I'd fucking love a dracthyr tank
[3:15:49] ArcaneMaki: Such a missed opportunity with Dracthyr
[3:15:52] Kanrad: With 10.0.7 going back to their home I bet we see new classes they can play
[3:15:58] NierrEdits: let me be a literal juggernaut dragon
[3:16:03] ClassicMalcontent: Druid shapeshift though otherwise plate
[3:16:05] shayneeking: They can’t balance the tanks they already have
[3:16:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tinker is more likely to have spec, I think, though
[3:16:06] ClassicMalcontent: doubt others
[3:16:10] ArcaneMaki: Valdrakken has massive dragonkind tank all over the place.
[3:16:32] TheSweetTatertot: tank Dracthyr turns into a dragon :O
[3:16:33] hammack52: you have 3 leather tanks
[3:16:34] TheVaracob: demo warlock tanks lets go
[3:16:35] Raxxiety: already have the name "Survival"
[3:16:40] zeiours: @towelliee Are you signing up to m+ dungeon event
[3:16:41] thebakeriscomingforu: hmm, a tank spec with a pet would be neat
[3:16:43] Bernardo994: i still want my 2h enhance shammy
[3:16:44] Knocx: like the warden in ESO
[3:16:50] Kanrad: Wouldn't it be flippin sweet if they let Drac be a DH!?
[3:16:58] darexyy: @Towelliee but how would that work in pvp
[3:17:00] TheVaracob: thats the class fantasy of demo lock
[3:17:05] peinen: They’ve butchered survival since legion, little to no faith they’d pull that off properly
[3:17:24] ClassicMalcontent: I highly doubt others. Druids being the lore for shapeshifting. Could they? Yeah. All classes 'could' tank if they used their 'metamorphisis' or some transformation to 'make other tanks'. Will they? Not sure.
[3:17:29] Raynesis: imagine pet path bugged when trying to shield wall LuL
[3:17:30] infektyd: RIP explosive shot MoP survival..
[3:17:36] infektyd: black arrow and all
[3:18:16] ClassicMalcontent: Personally. I want a Demon Hunter 'healer' TAKE THIS FEL ENERGY TO HEAL Kappa

[3:18:28] crimsonchins121: Act as my tank
[3:18:36] Raynesis: PETA is calling
[3:18:43] hammack52: yeah the coding for that to work for one spec and not for another would be insane
[3:18:44] akia03: with wow pet ai that would suck
[3:18:46] Aquadriel: so a sac?
[3:18:49] TheOldSchoolRyan: Bring back Spirit Bond
[3:18:52] TheVaracob: demo lock could tank in mists  (and BBC) and ive wanted demo tank sense
[3:18:59] Bernardo994: peta bread
[3:19:02] GrandGuy95: or pet takes the whole thing and its like a cd
[3:19:11] Bernardo994: master

[3:24:10] Nathanonfire: It shouldn’t be because you should be refreshing your bone shield on the last GCD of the previous pack and rolling a defensive going into a new pack
[3:24:44] Dragon3283: good evening
[3:24:53] 1wex_1: Guardian and DK are the most sus at the start of a pull veng a little too
[3:24:53] cyb0rg_007: evoker still a scary class. might need to level mine
[3:25:03] Nathanonfire: With proper play you should never run into a new pull with zero bone stacks and zero defensives….. and death striking back to back is not advise d

[3:52:31] SSD511_: Hmmm not for me
[3:52:32] ThePawPaw: @mat3br0n7 ahead of curve
[3:52:33] zodd_amhai: the running is sooo bad
[3:52:34] ClassicMalcontent: So many dev and animation teams need to learn proper half-step animations
[3:52:36] looney199725: i dunno im still not buyin into this game hype
[3:52:37] Goldeneye298: yea noticed that too, hopefully they fix that come launch which they probably will haha
[3:52:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: Ashes of Star Citizen
[3:52:41] Nokterian: the running animation so clunky LUL
[3:52:43] TopLegend123: is it wow in 8k? psgDAGBA psgDAGBA
[3:52:46] neverbornlucky: its eso right ?
[3:52:49] theDirtyon3: what in the fuck LUL

[3:53:00] ThePawPaw: @mat3br0n7 oh ashesh of creaton my bad
[3:53:03] mavericks312: alpha better look good after 6 yrs lol
[3:53:12] ClassicMalcontent: Slow step. Half step. And mid-step stop and stand and the walk again. Fluid animation and proper handling takes work.
[3:53:16] looney199725: cuz game seems to undertuned
[3:53:18] looney199725: to need it
[3:53:30] looney199725: looks like hes just W whole thing
[3:53:31] ergolucky: @thepawpaw thanks towHi
[3:53:44] Molvonos: "I like their size" no context
[3:53:48] TialePetit: the party names being in red like the mob is confusing
[3:53:51] Pharaoh_326: they need better nameplates @Towelliee
[3:53:55] manmower: it's all about the artists
[3:53:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: well that matrix unreal tech demo set the bar high
[3:54:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: The terrain looks nice
[3:54:03] ClassicMalcontent: UE5 has options and they are likely using it for a mid-range system sweet spot
[3:54:11] WoW_StandalonE: better then new world
[3:54:17] ClassicMalcontent: And yeah art assets and artwork and textures matter
[3:54:18] Holysal: @Wvznt_Me thats like one of the last things
[3:54:38] Nuttballl: combat means more than anything else, graphics dont rly matter passed a certain point
[3:54:47] looney199725: i dunno i feel this is one of those games thats all hype and flops sadly
[3:54:55] jarilrpg: looks to me (graphically) like a slightly better New World
[3:54:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: dead LUL
[3:55:10] manmower: looks like you have a lot less abilities in ashes
[3:55:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: better salesman then a tank LUL
[3:55:21] Holysal: well he just stood in the lighting KEKW
[3:55:22] WoW_StandalonE: noob
[3:55:26] WoW_StandalonE: 4Head
[3:55:27] Zzephferus: can tell Steven wasn't really a tank player in any other MMO's
[3:55:31] shimwood: Maybe he needs WAs to track it Kappa
[3:55:37] SSD511_: GM down LUL
[3:55:42] dracullus: when this game was revealed, back in WoD? xD
[3:56:02] looney199725: games been worked on for 6+ years so far
[3:56:12] manmower: gotta keep the graphics low to keep the framerates up
[3:56:13] xhaven: nah new world looks way better than this as of now, hopefully AOC looks better when it actually comes out
[3:56:25] PidiaP: AoC marathon 2030 PogChamp
[3:56:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: The weapon and spell effects are not as good looking as the lighting and terrain and characters
[3:56:34] ArcaneMaki: Dr. Doom, is that you?
[3:56:41] mavericks312: why does this look like the wish version of new world
[3:56:44] SSD511_: It’s should be way better
[3:56:48] neverbornlucky: don't worry towelliee his tanking is not as bad as Elon Musk's tiny house
[3:56:53] WoW_StandalonE: @xhaven new world combat is way worse the this tho

[3:57:26] looney199725: for 6 years work im not rly impressed ngl
[3:57:26] manmower: look at the grass
[3:57:48] TheSweetTatertot: Can confirm. I play wow on a 480Ti
[3:57:52] mavericks312: this shit dont look close to coming at all
[3:57:52] Ghostpuddlez: i think he needs to pass the torch to someone else for the showcases and just narrate, hes great at explaining and talking.
[3:57:59] xhaven: @WoW_StandalonE not way worse but definitely not as good true, however NEW WOrld isnt tab target combat
[3:57:59] noketchupjust_sauce: 980ti? you can even play it with a gt610m
[3:58:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: i was on a 980 ti up until i got my origin last year LUL
[3:58:04] homewrecker101: i play wow on a 750ti lol
[3:58:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: UE5 is going to need graphics power for that lighting and such, yeah
[3:58:05] Holysal: Yep in WoW you lag no matter the PC KEKW
[3:58:21] Synaerio: @homewrecker101 o.o
[3:58:26] Molvonos: @Holysal You need a new hamster homie, lol
[3:58:41] zodd_amhai: WoW still looks better than this unreal engine 5
[3:58:49] ArcaneMaki: Unreal Engine 5 is not super well optimized. You need to dev your additional tools on top of it to optimize your game properly (game dev for 15 years_
[3:58:50] mavericks312: new worlds combat looks better then this shit l;ol
[3:58:59] Holysal: @Holysal i have a 2080ti
[3:59:08] manmower: big backpacks
[3:59:09] warn1ng: ninja looting incoming
[3:59:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: master loot? asmon gonna be all in for sure now Kappa
[3:59:24] Molvonos: Keep in mind @Towelliee They just came up with the tech to JUMP and SHOOT at the same time.  They're excited about everything.
[3:59:26] Synaerio: @zodd_amhai if Blizzard updated WoW to UR5, it would break the MMO scene
[3:59:43] mavericks312: @HaxzorJimDuggan so he can ninja everything
[3:59:49] manmower: neverwinter animations yea
[3:59:50] Holysal: you want to see a bad mmo look at Embersadrift LUL
[3:59:51] Forlagon: @Synaerio and my computer
[3:59:53] biirrd: yes
[4:00:04] biirrd: so much NV
[4:00:05] mavericks312: @Synaerio its doesnt need ue 5 though
[4:00:06] manmower: has that same flashiness
[4:00:08] biirrd: NW
[4:00:09] Synaerio: @Forlagon update
[4:00:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: The ways the weapon and shield move seem good
[4:00:18] soysos91: looks like DragonAge
[4:00:26] Zernmox: I am getting LOTRO vibes looking at this game
[4:00:48] warn1ng: i wonder if alpha2 will come out this year
[4:01:12] Gezber: 8
[4:01:15] Zzephferus: 64
[4:01:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: 7 buttons is not bad, I think

[4:02:23] akia03: this open world or a instance?
[4:02:39] Immortalityx: @akia03 Open world
[4:02:40] Holysal: open world i believe
[4:02:59] xhaven: ...where are the animals/ambient cretures? World looks kinda dead without them
[4:03:04] manmower: how many years has this been in development?
[4:03:17] Immortalityx: @manmower Since early 2017
[4:03:24] Holysal: if its open world I wonder how many ppl will grief
[4:03:30] Immortalityx: Had 1 year deducted for a big rework
[4:03:43] Molvonos: The Warhammer MMO had fucking AWESOME tank mechanics.
[4:03:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: SWTOR's tank makes an impact in PvP, yes
[4:03:46] Immortalityx: @Holysal Can't imagine it's many thanks to the corruption system
[4:03:47] Molvonos: Directional blocking, etc
[4:03:59] BobLongMVP: were wildstar tanks op? in pvp dont remember
[4:04:21] Holysal: @Holysal yeah i would like to see how that will work in practice
[4:04:22] CYNIC308: Warhammer Online let tanks Taunt other players and they did less dmg to everyone but the tank until the it wore off and player collision helps tanks in pvp a ton!
[4:04:25] Skizzurp: idk swtor early on had the guaranteed crit tank build that was OP asf
[4:04:26] manmower: @Molvonos yea that warhammer g ame had a lot of good stuff, needed more dev time though
[4:04:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would assume yes, right click to block
[4:04:46] Immortalityx: It should in action combat mode
[4:05:23] CYNIC308: wind in the grass
[4:05:31] manmower: why does the grass move as big clumps instead of individual blades?
[4:05:32] Immortalityx: Wind actors, basically he means the grass reacting to their attacks
[4:05:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: The sounds seem alright
[4:05:46] Bernardo994: this whole thing look like poo
[4:05:48] zodd_amhai: dude im telling u the graphics is soo suss
[4:05:51] manmower: swaying back and forth, it must be alive

[4:05:55] Bernardo994: nothing new or popping
[4:05:57] Aidler: grass is alive
[4:06:07] ashwing_: This looks so underwhelming tbh
[4:06:15] fatal_flaww: its too wavy
[4:06:23] xhaven: it doesnt look like its wind moving it
[4:06:29] Skizzurp: yea just cuz on object is there doesnt mean it has to move kekw
[4:06:31] manmower: grass has wind but not the vines on the walls
[4:06:32] Immortalityx: I mean, looks just fine in the seasons showcase. It changes depending on the weather
[4:06:33] Mecabeast: the grass makes me uncomfortable compared to the rest of the enviornment
[4:06:35] Bernardo994: but yea its alhpa to be fare
[4:06:45] akia03: they still have 20 years to fine tune it
[4:06:53] PaperRouteDolph: What game is this?
[4:06:57] zodd_amhai: it just loooks so fake
[4:07:02] manmower: i've seen a lot of grass in my life, this ain't it

[4:07:14] Aidler: oh yeah we can interact with the grass… lol
[4:07:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: The grass getting knocked down by abilities is good

[4:07:38] Runmal: Adds to the immersion a wee bit
[4:07:40] manmower: i wonder if they did all this grass just to have that effect
[4:07:41] Gezber: Visual fidelity is great, but the gameplay monkaS
[4:07:49] SilkeySmooth: ashes of creation is the next star vcitizen forever alpha 2.0..lol
[4:08:14] manmower: that 2handed warrior should be the focus of this video
[4:08:20] Immortalityx: @SilkeySmooth Pretty L take, A2 isn't even out. Just like Star Citizen
[4:08:21] Tooyoo: all the grass moving at same rate is very weird. Looks like the whole screen is shimmering
[4:08:35] wastecasetv: it looks so clunky
[4:08:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: The effects are cartoony
[4:08:47] ArcaneMaki: Not sure I like the fact that friendly name and enemy names are the same colors.
[4:08:50] CYNIC308: wasnt Neverwinter click to move?
[4:08:56] Morduukk: towellie backseating
[4:08:59] WSquiggle12: Man I haven't thought about neverwinter in years
[4:09:15] SilkeySmooth: @Immortalityx ashes has been in alpha for 6+ years...lmao
[4:09:23] Decree22: damn I haven't thought about Neverwinter in a long time. I loved that game.
[4:09:24] Immortalityx: Everything is customizable
[4:09:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: It needs a real threat indicator, true
[4:09:38] Broomba: @towelliee -- you have access to early alpha for AoC?
[4:09:44] Immortalityx: @SilkeySmooth No it hasn't? Atleast get your facts straight before you say something
[4:09:53] Molvonos: Man, these guys playing like they've never MMO'd before.
[4:09:58] Autoexeq: How do new games end up not even being as smooth looking as classic wow
[4:10:49] cinnamonamon: @Towelliee "i hope it's more than 5 or 6 buttons."  ALSO @Towelliee "I love how simple it is"
[4:10:51] Molvonos: Classic Wow, Smooth?  lol.
[4:10:52] manmower: they want more moves than WoW
[4:10:53] CYNIC308: "Button Bloat"
[4:11:06] Autoexeq: Towelliee been blessed by the warriors this patch. I can hear him converting
[4:11:07] roflpotamus: WoW has a lot, but I feel like ffxiv is a bit over the top forsurre love it still though
[4:11:10] Skizzurp: well if its too simple a lot of people jsut wont play it kekw
[4:11:13] yahnoz: how long is the tutorial for the 3090 is it just the beginning or do you have to finish the campaign map?

[4:13:05] manmower: futuristic, is there going to be space stuff?
[4:13:06] Immortalityx: It's a showcase xD
[4:13:20] Immortalityx: Alpha 0 -> Alpha 1 -> Alpha 2 -> Beta

[4:13:32] Immortalityx: 2
[4:13:36] Immortalityx: Beta 1 and Beta 2
[4:13:40] manmower: another 4 years or so
[4:13:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not getting hyped until I am in an open beta
[4:13:47] scema12: 3-4 years
[4:13:52] Broomba: https://ashesofcreation.wiki/Release_schedule here u go @towelliee

[4:16:55] Immortalityx: @jjw_aus Server cap is 10,000 so i doubt it

[4:18:43] xhaven: I think people are overestimating how many mmo players will want to have hard mobs while questing, so far none of the mmo that have tried to implement that for modern gamers have succeeded
[4:18:59] Immortalityx: Dw @Towelliee He will look better in 5-10 minutes
[4:19:03] UncleBliz: Group of 8 is a large group compared to other mmo
[4:19:09] manmower: they show high level armor normally
[4:19:15] Immortalityx: Can't have asmongold ninja looting without everyone else knowing
[4:19:28] Immortalityx: True, but this is level 15 after all
[4:19:33] ColdChillXI: sign of gear diversity?

[4:20:43] CYNIC308: ok i dont agree with that at all LUL

[4:21:08] scema12: Pantheon looks good? never heard that
[4:21:14] CYNIC308: im def playing Pantheon but it looks like garbo next to AoC
[4:21:23] Aidler: so no solo leveling and gameplay in AoC?
[4:21:27] wicket9: i feel like the shadows on the grass is all messed up, looks kinda bad
[4:21:28] Immortalityx: @CYNIC308 Same tbh
[4:21:30] mavericks312: gonna be atleast 20 yrs lol
[4:21:33] coffeetimeeeee: almost 6 years since kickstarter
[4:21:45] Immortalityx: @Aidler You can solo level. But an MMO is about playing together
[4:21:50] inxszane: did they turn down the graphics a little bit here?
[4:22:07] TheGamerME: @mavericks312 you saying star citizen will come out before this ?
[4:22:24] Immortalityx: @mavericks312 Kek, nah
[4:22:25] ColdChillXI: Yeah
[4:22:27] TheCliffyShow: Graphics don't appeal to me. Looks to generic. I like stylized graphics like WoW and SWTOR.
[4:22:30] Aidler: @immortalityx not for me. did that in the past. nowadays I have too much to do in RL
[4:22:31] Holysal: @Aidler alot of ppl now play mmos solo now
[4:22:33] SSD511_: So it’s not for anti social people LUL
[4:22:33] firekingkyle: Its made to encourage people to play together, this is a community driven game. Makes sense.
[4:22:34] xhaven: @Immortalityx maybe years ago but there is a reason that solo leveling mmos have become so popular

[4:23:15] Immortalityx: @xhaven I'm not saying you can't level solo.  But there's benefits to grouping, so that's up to the player ofc
[4:23:17] theSalute: hahahaha
[4:23:19] Molvonos: 'BOOM!' -2 hp.
[4:23:23] Gezber: KEKW boom

[4:24:32] Holysal: @TheCliffyShow no
[4:24:40] Sayryn: AOC now with more BOOM!
[4:25:06] wicket9: steven is the kinda player out there bricking my keys
[4:25:06] TheCliffyShow: AOC? Age of Conan? Then where's the boobs?
[4:25:08] labryntha: I think he blocked too late because sometimes he mitigate 50% of the hit
[4:25:15] theDirtyon3: "if" the game comes out
[4:25:18] Immortalityx: The area is meant for 8 people, but yeah, open world means competition
[4:25:22] TheGamerME: just like launch day for new world LOl
[4:25:45] Molvonos: +10% more BOOM!

[4:26:06] Immortalityx: @Aidler It's not
[4:26:17] Gezber: @Aidler open world
[4:26:20] Gunther_TheGoat: is this a low level dungeon? seems like there are no mechanics
[4:26:27] Immortalityx: Practically nothing in this game is instanced
[4:26:28] Gezber: There's very little instances
[4:26:29] Aidler: ah ok
[4:26:34] Gunther_TheGoat: oh that explains it
[4:26:39] Holysal: @harmon1c they are 15
[4:26:41] CYNIC308: nothing is instanced in this game no?
[4:26:41] Immortalityx: @harmon1c Open world elite area, so yeah, not many mechanics
[4:26:43] pavepawns: will you be doing raid streams every day until the 3090 or only yesterday and upcoming friday?
[4:26:44] Gezber: @harmon1c level 15 or so
[4:26:48] Gezber: 50 is max
[4:26:51] ClassicMalcontent: They definitely need to work on the half-step stutter-step animations.
[4:27:14] pavepawns: aight
[4:27:46] warn1ng: steven said in a past video that he has never played wow, thats a little concerning to he hasn't played the best mmorpg  and he's trying to develop the next best mmorpg. does he even know what good combat feels like?

[4:30:10] Sir_Cranium: Got it got it, I have heard of that. I was confused like how have I not heard of this
[4:30:18] Zurn77: AoC?

[4:32:00] c0mmander_starscream: Is Trion Worlds the maker of this game?
[4:32:01] Immortalityx: @danimoto10 Top tier wow VS level 15 gameplay?
[4:32:02] Gunther_TheGoat: it hurts!
[4:32:09] Calphurnious: @Autoexeq why play eso in general?
[4:32:11] ClassicMalcontent: experience the PvPvE and whatnot. The cries of 'toxic' from Day 0 in this. Kappa
[4:32:22] Knocx: wonder what year they hire UX designers
[4:32:32] SSD511_: Do the BOOOM!
[4:32:33] Molvonos: If he gets over excited for mitigating an additional 2 damage, taking 5 extra damage is 'IM HURTIN' definitely

[4:32:40] Immortalityx: @Knocx Bad joke
[4:32:45] Autoexeq: I swear, he the type of guy to shout "Bazingah"
[4:32:49] Gunther_TheGoat: @danimoto10 Have they shown "top tier" AOC?

[4:35:07] Calphurnious: See you in unreal engine 6
[4:35:09] Gunther_TheGoat: yeah def needs work. Hopefully it ends up being good
[4:35:09] DoubleNova: this game comin out in 2030?
[4:35:12] ClassicMalcontent: @c0mmander_starscream because they 'member' (or need to remember) to work on their art assets in UE5? Kappa
[4:35:26] mavericks312: @DoubleNova nah 2085
[4:35:29] stratiss: wow is also easier on the bitrate
[4:35:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Riot's MMO is probably going to look like Dragonflight, I think
[4:35:42] kaoticbacon: art over realism

[5:53:28] darkgaurdian07: always something lol
[5:54:04] Noctiluca91: you guys planning on doing razs?

[5:56:21] Peqdevil: I used on Whetstone
[5:56:37] zeiours: @towelliee Do you think they should remove the Valor cap, I do
[5:56:59] duhworks: 2-3 weeks
[5:57:54] manmower: way old school mentality
[5:58:03] Mecabeast: im ok with a cap on how much you can hold so that way it encourages spending but when you cant get something to drop higher level it feels bad staring at a 376 pieces and knowing youll spend all the valor for a season to max it
[5:58:12] NattyPally: valor based on key level?
[5:58:27] cynical_j0k3r: Yea. They don’t want people to just upgrade their gear to skip mythic plus prog.
[5:59:39] nickydre: lol
[5:59:48] dreamwalker213: cap is fine, should just be higher imo
[5:59:52] cynical_j0k3r: They want you to do 5’a then 6’s and so on. They want some natural prog. It’s also how you get better at dungeons. Not by just jumping into the deep end.
[6:00:24] cynical_j0k3r: Amount of valor you get is based on if anyone in the groups io has increased.
[6:00:27] zhc_: u gotta get certain rating to upgrade after a certain ammount
[6:00:31] darkgaurdian07: if they didn't want people to skip mythic prog why they allowing you to get any item from mythic raid as long as you've cleared normal. people getting raz trinkets in vault but only done 2 bosses
[6:01:29] Dcarter: that doesnt equate to gettin 415 in a week though
[6:01:33] cynical_j0k3r: Yeah. That’s the counter. @darkgaurdian07
[6:02:03] cynical_j0k3r: All these “bad” players are getting gear they don’t deserve

[6:02:31] dreamwalker213: yeah you still have to get 2400 to get it to 415 so you still need to actually do high content
[6:02:53] mulletrocker11358: its just the bonus valor u dont get if theres no key upgrade
[6:02:53] saebus: i think dathea resets agro when the knock back happens
[6:02:55] zhc_: yeha u still gotta do highest keys to be able to upgrade
[6:02:59] purplejesusss: even level 10 is capped at 1400 rating
[6:03:01] Dcarter: but the fact is people will get it and they dont want that
[6:03:05] TheGiant99: @cynical_j0k3r who are to choose what people deserve and not deserve
[6:03:17] hammack52: i mean you have to do the hard levels to even have the ability to upgrade them so i dont see the problem with the uncapped valor and leaving everything els alone
[6:03:34] Dcarter: bc getting 2400 isnt necessarily hard
[6:03:40] pharmaticus: pharmaticus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months!

[6:04:07] Peqdevil: ^
[6:04:14] dreamwalker213: @Dcarter i mean for the "casual" players who dont do higher then 10s it is
[6:04:21] Exxcar: My big concern is more I want something to counteract bad RNG drops
[6:04:27] Synaerio: @TheGiant99 there ability or lack of to play the content they want to. If they want to they need to simply get better before they deserve the gear, its simple.
[6:04:42] Exxcar: If you run NO 40+ times, I feel you should just get to pick one item from the dungeon
[6:04:53] Dcarter: BOY DO I KNOW THAT FEELING
[6:04:59] duhworks: just cap it so you have to be at a certain IO level to upgrade like pvp with rating
[6:05:11] Exxcar: Hell have it be a +2 of the item so you still have to work it up
[6:05:31] Exxcar: But going literally an entire season without seeing a key piece that you need even drop is just not good
[6:05:32] TheGiant99: @Synaerio what does it matter to you and how does it effect you what opthers have......its a video game my god

[6:08:10] Exxcar: @TheGiant99 wut? Towelliee making a living with gaming has nothing to do with what gear he gets
[6:08:34] TheGiant99: Wasnt refering to @Towelliee
[6:09:08] cynical_j0k3r: He was talking to me. My explanation was to long
[6:09:30] cynical_j0k3r: There is Tyne and reason to what I am saying
[6:09:46] TheGiant99: @Exxcar was refering to the people in chat you feel they get to choose what people deserve and not deserve in a video game
[6:09:57] Synaerio: @TheGiant99 Look at the bigger picture, the point was, there are.
[6:10:08] GodKingMuninn: Badge systems are great
[6:10:08] Molvonos: 3 Dinar per season
[6:10:12] manmower: halfway point
[6:10:21] dreamwalker213: yeah im not sure how other people getting gear/upgrading it has any effect on the people who make a living playing wow
[6:10:43] cynical_j0k3r: Yea. Need an pemdas.
[6:10:46] TheGiant99: @Synaerio i do look at the biug picture and I could care less what others have that I may or may not have in a video game
[6:11:30] Synaerio: @dreamwalker213 Then spend more time, more effort and more resources, why should someone who performs subpar in comparison deserve the gear when they're gonna dip in 3 months because they dont have what it takes to play on the level they want.
[6:12:07] Synaerio: In the end this whole "convo" is perception based
[6:12:11] TheGiant99: I love all these try hards in chat....it cracks me up
[6:13:48] dreamwalker213: @dreamwalker213 my point is, towellie for example is gonna get his gear, upgrade his gear regardless. Why would he give a shit about other people
[6:14:04] Synaerio: @TheGiant99 Then you playing doesn't pay your bills, so that mentality would make sense.
