[1:16:51] WolfyRofl: Loss for Arms
[1:16:51] OhShetWaddup: team player
[1:16:53] Sly_404: being a warrior is a dmg loss to begin with KEKW
[1:16:59] uniqueusername7: its a tiny dps loss to help the group a bit
[1:17:00] Silverwards: @Nopsuliini don't you mean larboard and starboard?
[1:17:01] Boossterr: you lose 1% crit

[1:17:08] kitty0chi: @Nopsuliini ok, i trust
[1:17:15] Grillyo: I just call for star of david formation and people seem to get in position
[1:17:19] Rick_Haus: inviting a warrior definitely damage loss
[1:17:33] Nopsuliini: @Tai_Silverward i prefer lardboard
[1:17:35] uniqueusername7: @Sly_404 if you give warrior 5% of the other melees damage hes actually top :)   warrior is an augment spec

[1:20:46] spicymisoovo: U get to share a hivemind brain with other warrior players
[1:20:46] Icedale1092: Class fantasy kappa

[1:20:57] endakenny: Some people like the zug zug
[1:21:01] BLACKFOOT_TN: I love Fury play. But the damage is lacking as fuck this expansion
[1:21:07] dango0n: their character color is doodoo brown ffs lol
[1:21:11] zeDancer: is it not cool that in a world where everyone is "Super", you as a Warrior, can compete on an equal level with just armor and weapons
[1:21:16] Magruun: early S1 Prot Warrior was meta Shruge
[1:21:18] captkapusta: its supposed to be the "simple" class
[1:21:28] Sly_404: Arms seems such a strange spec to me, like i dont roll the buffed dude with the big 2hander to do bleed dmg
[1:21:33] n0s0upbr0: s1 prot war was good for like 2 months then the game decided to shaft them
[1:21:34] Rick_Haus: @Magruun for 3 weeks
[1:21:36] n0s0upbr0: it was disgusting
[1:21:39] spicymisoovo: when are they chaging this dumb defile visual effect, its just annoying
[1:21:41] Inenta: @Magruun because all the other tanks sucked ass until tuning haha that's it
[1:21:50] CSmith170: i wanna like unholydk but im trash at it
[1:21:56] othernewname: what can i do as a tank in the archer room? every time ppl chain  die and they leave like mad kids
[1:22:05] dango0n: I feel like the players who play warrior are the same players who would play Farmer if it were a class
[1:22:05] flebbooo: yea its a cock
[1:22:08] Cellule00: Hey dorki im starting to play VDH what craft would you go for in order?

[1:24:03] Sly_404: playing enhancer i would probably die every single pull you do
[1:24:04] AthoosHS: @dorki do you think there should be another round of nerfs to dungs? if yes, do u htink it will happen?
[1:24:06] Clevelandmk: dk is so good defensivly
[1:24:08] Clevelandmk: just need more dam
[1:24:08] dango0n: I wish DK was better for pugging
[1:24:11] manlyhandles: dk is the true PAYPHONE
[1:24:14] Celestial990: unholy is surprisingly tackier than blood
[1:24:15] NattyPally: what prcos first, trinket cheat or talent cheat?
[1:24:17] uniqueusername7: just become a bear :)
[1:24:18] BingoTingler: does dk dps stackvers?
[1:24:22] Celestial990: goddamn auto correct
[1:24:23] Railey_1990: @Creativezjpeg i have looked at those was but its not in there, or i s it?
[1:24:25] TheGame402: @NattyPally talent
[1:24:32] GreenConure: give rise some extra timer
[1:24:35] VelocityVolt: they need to add time to rise lmao
[1:24:36] spicymisoovo: Buff DK plzzzz
[1:24:37] Lynvand: adjustments to nasty 1shots
[1:24:37] kaysiix: NERF EB BOSS ON TYRA
[1:24:42] Ckraigfriend: how is season 4 looking for unholy dk
[1:24:45] kitty0chi: but the amount of one-hit shots is just insane
[1:24:50] uniqueusername7: healer dispeled a dk ICANT
[1:24:51] Clevelandmk: they need to rework dk so bad
[1:24:52] beemer92bw: last boss in rise, the frontal debuff as a tank can ligma
[1:24:56] Clevelandmk: especially this fcking dnd
[1:24:56] Varthar: they’re just waiting for 10.2.5 Copium
[1:24:59] magnusz: surely warrior gets buffed right ? COPIUM
[1:25:03] FareweII_: 8-9 months yeah
[1:25:10] downbeatx: Like i know your right, but i really hope your not. i feel like they havent done any where near enough to dungeons.
[1:25:10] nalegi07: I will die on the hill they should have done some shadowlands dungeons this expac
[1:25:15] uniqueusername7: warrior got a flameshock reflect
[1:25:18] uniqueusername7: hes gonna top dmg
[1:25:22] mk__9: i mean if .5 patch doesnt bring balance patches then its over
[1:25:25] spicymisoovo: seriously they gotta reduce the chances of being 1 shot in S3 M+
[1:25:39] codethename: This do be the season of one shots
[1:25:41] epikouros_kathigitis: Do you baer sometimes?
[1:26:17] spicymisoovo: what happened to bear dudes after season 2
[1:26:25] WolfyRofl: at around 50% crit u get 35% parry + 23%, with DS + sigil does it reach 100% parry or huge DR happens?
[1:26:25] zeph_6: check spell reflect dmg?
[1:26:26] mk__9: @spicymisoovo tierset diff
[1:26:32] spicymisoovo: u have lichbane u dont need to los
[1:26:38] uniqueusername7: well the set bonus was carrying the spec and they nerfed the spec not the set, then they lost the set bonus
[1:26:39] WolfyRofl: Cause I tried tanking this boss with VDH in Tyra and no totem break and it was fine
[1:26:40] Sly_404: "feral key" and "for fun" don't compute KEKW
[1:26:40] zeph_6: HOLY
[1:26:41] spicymisoovo: there wont be any dmg
[1:26:41] BLACKFOOT_TN: What kills me is Blizzard can't be bothered to have a dedicated team to just watch over M+ and PvP and just tweek the numbers. Like 3 people each would be all they would need. And they can't even be bothered to do that and still make shit loads of money.
[1:26:43] uniqueusername7: so it was 100% predictable
[1:26:44] jerkmcgee: and 5 talent points to make a 3 minute cooldown good
[1:26:44] TheGame402: @spicymisoovo problem is bosses are either target dummies and you deplete by timer or they are a challange and 1 shot you before you run out of dps
[1:26:45] epikouros_kathigitis: S4 bear promising?
[1:26:47] CSmith170: CSmith170 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:27:06] WolfyRofl: at around 50% crit u get 35% parry + 23%, with DS + sigil does it reach 100% parry or huge DR happens?
[1:27:06] uniqueusername7: season 4 bear gets s2 set again
[1:27:08] uniqueusername7: so its gonna be lit
[1:27:10] mk__9: we gonna have boon again
[1:27:10] abucken: Is tankyness a must in keys above +25? Is that why Windwalkers for example isn't meta?
[1:27:13] mk__9: ofc its gonna be good
[1:27:23] zeph_6: grieftorch my beloved
[1:27:25] zeph_6: come back
[1:27:26] Sly_404: i just want grief torch back
[1:27:29] WolfyRofl: Cause I tried tanking this boss with VDH in Tyra and no totem break and it was fine
[1:27:30] Clevelandmk: i wish they would remove the dnd
[1:27:38] Clevelandmk: but it's in the next expansion heroic talent tree
[1:27:44] icebreakerssss: @dorki you should mute your mic its good for pushing i heard
[1:27:54] spicymisoovo: Boomkin would be a good example for not tanky lmao
[1:28:03] abucken: What is it that makes or brakes then?
[1:28:08] TBouse: dorki boomkin is squishy because bear form isnt keybound
[1:28:08] uniqueusername7: except moonkin can become a bear
[1:28:10] downbeatx: Have anythoughts on hunter?
[1:28:14] uniqueusername7: other classes just flop
[1:28:17] reichfeld: windwalker are slept on tbh
[1:28:18] cheataki: bear form 1.4mil hp lul
[1:28:22] TotallyNotRaien: they lose all their damage in bear form
[1:28:25] Sly_404: idk as enhancer i feel like I am one def cd away from being solid
[1:28:33] uniqueusername7: @TotallyNotRaien you lose even more damage if you die
[1:28:41] uniqueusername7: and if its a 1 shot mechanic then you dont have a choice
[1:28:44] ooSidaoo: yea and you have 2 ppl moving you around, u dont move xD
[1:29:00] thetorque162: KEKW

[1:29:25] uniqueusername7: @CubeX_LIVE blood dk is the easiest tank to learn no meme
[1:29:30] CSmith170: i swaped away from boomy because its just tooo squish. its the most unfun defensive to just have to jump into bear form to live
[1:29:31] Chompsy: PEPW
[1:29:33] CubeX_LIVE: @uwusheepuwu why is that?
[1:29:35] manlyhandles: xdd

[1:29:37] TheGame402: rogue should have just bearformd
[1:29:37] kaysiix: seems depleto
[1:29:40] wrecluse1: bear might be the worst feeling defensive in the game lol
[1:29:41] kaysiix: timer is fucked
[1:29:53] CubeX_LIVE: @uniqueusername7 i boosted a pally since i liked the way i could swap to dps and healer if i had to but feel like pally isnt so easy
[1:29:59] thetorque162: no hammer HUH

[1:30:49] kitty0chi: drums and youre fine
[1:30:59] uniqueusername7: @CubeX_LIVE in low keys blood being a bit squishy doesnt matter, you are encouraged to use your defensives and their cds are super low.  and you dont need to think to maintain their armor buff like paly or druid do.  people worry that blood strike is somehow hard to use but its literally all you need to worry about in low keys

[2:05:34] oevrit: 27 is bis

[2:07:26] Celestial990: HOLY what cpu gives you these smooth frames?

[4:50:00] luxationwow: @n0s0upbr0 depends on the social standard you hold yourself to I guess, my guy isn’t winning anything or making money from this game at the moment. So a lil apology & move on would’ve been the smart play imo. He’s a lil younger than me & has kids, I’d hate making myself a meme when I could’ve just got it swept under the carpet

[4:53:44] luxationwow: that comment is pretty wide of the mark for a lot of industries, surprising it isn’t for yours
[4:53:46] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: this drama is lame af
