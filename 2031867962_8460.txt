[4:48:26] dnbandanxiety: im making a bootleg
[4:50:22] Grubfist: oh man, that's that turtle I tamed once without the rest of my random LFG group knowing
[4:50:34] Grubfist: they reported him missing as a bug
[4:50:53] dnbandanxiety: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4 elite 11/10 wood fuq this beat
[4:51:07] Grubfist: I named him Contraband because of how I got him
[4:51:26] Grubfist: oh no wait
[4:51:41] Grubfist: I tamed the 5man one
[4:51:48] Grubfist: but he was on a lil island like this
[4:54:26] Grubfist: yeah it was definitely that turtle in the 5-man version of that instance during cata
[4:54:30] Grubfist: I had to google to make sure
[4:54:50] Grubfist: apparently they just made it a raid for this season thingy you doin
[4:55:35] Grubfist: it was when they made his model super cool and spiky with lots of moss and stuff on him in cata
[4:55:43] Grubfist: I was leveling a goblin hunter and I tamed him
[4:55:56] Grubfist: never said a word but they determined I didn't do that
[4:56:17] Nightbot: Drop a follow if you are new to the stream and want to support <3
[4:56:41] Grubfist: just pulled some crabs, got healed, the healer drew aggro on the crabs and yelled at the tank, who was confused at the crabs being there and in the confusion I ran ahead and tamed the turtle, then came back and helped them finish killing the crabs
[4:57:40] Grubfist: then they ran up to the boss island and got confused at the lack of a turtle
[4:58:12] Grubfist: then the tank asked me if I tamed it and the healer suddenly insisted I couldn't have, so they all decided to report it as a bug
[4:58:14] Grubfist: I said nothing
[4:59:49] Grubfist: then after the dungeon, I summoned him back out and named him Contraband cuz i smuggled him through that sungeon
[4:59:53] Grubfist: *dungeon
