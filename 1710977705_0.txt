[1:20:27] darkdestroz: right now in pvp if u do World pvp then tier sets are good, but for arena and battlegrounds, the pvp gear u buy and get from vault is better, cuz they have higher ilvl in pvp, so the basic ass honor gear u can get get to 411 in battlegrounds, so even if some1 is low geard if they are geared in full honor blues or conquest gear they are Geard from a pvp standpoint

[2:42:24] Ardailec: NOTED Ruby Life Pools...still hurts like hell.
[2:42:25] Dagomarus: If its physical it should be blockable
[2:42:28] thebakeriscomingforu: can you spell reflect that?
[2:43:26] gzus81: lol
[2:43:30] Djfarmville: 4 stacks even with SB up

[2:44:04] OmgItsEdizzle: it's all physical you need to cycle cd's.
[2:44:11] Oegn_: how long the dot lasting?
[2:44:32] OmgItsEdizzle: nope not how that works
[2:44:34] NBK_Sethus: eventually you run out of cd's and need an external, tank cant solo it
[2:44:48] Ryvden: he still should heal you lol

[2:47:37] citrinesoan: im back for 10 min
[2:47:50] NBK_Sethus: its 4 hits of physical + bleed
[2:48:19] GingerGambit: Healer trying to put all blame on the tank
[2:48:24] dutchie76: hey Rob
[2:48:42] gzus81: i dont think it was a tanking issue
[2:48:57] Solarwings: positioning issue

[2:50:02] 91Niki: Sounds like a positioning issue form the healer. They moved during moments when heavy healing was needed rather than moving before it was needed

[2:51:27] gzus81: yeah, unless youre an evoker or druid, you have to position correctly
[2:51:55] pokoisto: first RLP of the day ?
[2:51:58] Solarwings: ive seen 3 rets since M+ came out LUL
[2:52:21] gzus81: ret is pumping though
[2:52:40] 91Niki: Yeah, healer needs to anticipate where the circle is gonna be, and be standing outside of that at all times, without being in line with the group, risking boulder spawning on the group
[2:52:49] Solarwings: no one plays it though lol
[2:52:56] LoseAlotLuke: every ret i see slaps

[2:56:05] gzus81: idk, pre-nerf streets was pretty terrible too
[2:56:06] dutchie76: brackenhide in season 2 is going to be like plaguefall LUL
[2:56:10] JBarlak: Well yes you should be pulling that trash into that room. That’s what we see everyone do

[3:11:54] LoseAlotLuke: why is hunter not just arcane shotting
[3:11:54] KaisenSiru: You cannot escape the heat!

[3:12:19] dutchie76: rogue in group lol
[3:12:22] KaisenSiru: Exorcism
[3:12:23] ninetynil: i do not like this dungeon
[3:12:29] MedicineMan: To be fair, this is a hard key to heal, so give healer a break
[3:12:29] gzus81: you can literally just moonfire
[3:12:31] dutchie76: @xghostyyx yea stupid
[3:12:43] Crowargus: aa next

[3:13:04] WoW_StandalonE: @MedicineMan I'm a healer and this is our job usually

[3:13:48] dutchie76: wow
[3:13:51] MedicineMan: @MedicineMan Same. But this key has so much AOE. its hard keeping everyone topped and still doing orbs. DPS should help out
[3:13:54] the_bad_goat: Yup. Another explosion went off
[3:14:01] holst23: In Pugs everyone should deal with explosives
[3:14:02] gwar234: this boss is cancer
[3:14:05] Mecabeast: people aren't baiting properly it looks
[3:14:08] Whitemamba236: yea the paladin was right next to that explosive and just didnt tur naround to attack it

[3:15:07] dutchie76: well you did until someone missed orbs
[3:15:13] Strxin: Gotta make sure those explosives are dead. The DPS is focusing on the boss to much
[3:15:18] gzus81: well, atleast we know it wasnt a shield block issue

[3:17:04] Rudric_Ice: @Dyasis if u expect healers to dps expect the dps to do the mechanic too
[3:17:04] hwired: range needs to bait add spawn ahead of boss
[3:17:07] Dyasis: @Sollice yes it is, granted we can't get everyone but the majority it is our job
[3:17:13] DhioGaming: how did the tourny go yesterday
[3:17:15] DogShep: Explosives is everyone's job. Some healers will tell you that they will take care of all of them
[3:17:19] hwired: then run back behind boss
[3:17:27] AlphasaurusRexx: @Sollice link him the explosives counter wa
[3:17:27] Sollice: Why would you want just one person to heal and do explosives in a pug.
[3:17:42] dutchie76: ruh roh

[3:40:41] CeruleanStar: yeah you pull everythign to first boss
[3:40:54] Adventw0lf: I feel like the tank has the run of the route, no one else should dictate.  If you wanna steer the boat, go be a captain.  If you don't wanna be a captain, don't try to steer the boat.
[3:40:59] CeruleanStar: welle verything to 2nd boss really -- skip all that annoying frog bullshit
[3:41:11] AlphasaurusRexx: I understand people have optimized routes, but even if the tank does not do the route I think is normal, I still dont tell it how to pull or where to go.
[3:41:12] faulen: is there a date for the next MDI?

[3:42:15] thickcurves: instructions unclear, disconnectedthe rudder from boat
[3:42:32] OG_Fear: @Towelliee It requires a warlock
[3:42:36] Bowwjack: @Towelliee yeah
[3:42:36] OG_Fear: No u snap the dragon
[3:42:41] brewgamingtv: would need a hunter or rogue i believe
[3:42:41] snowdude1026: @Bowjack31 this was fixed, there was a video floating around.  not as intended
[3:42:45] OG_Fear: up to the 3rd boss ring
[3:42:46] sinlesssinner: razageth is a shit show on LFR
[3:42:52] OG_Fear: but yea it was fixed.
[3:42:53] pavepawns: dragon goes up a platform

[3:43:13] AlphasaurusRexx: they fixed it because you did zero mechanics
[3:43:14] OG_Fear: but it still does the breath
[3:43:19] sinlesssinner: @dutchie76 gz bro :)
[3:43:29] OG_Fear: and also the crystals don't spawn only like one of them gets up there
[3:43:30] dutchie76: no bow though

[3:44:20] dutchie76: or near
[3:44:28] OG_Fear: U kill 3rd boss first then u have someone pull the 4th boss and have them break combat via vanish/invis then accept their summon up to the 3rd platform lolll
[3:44:30] OG_Fear: it was pretty funny.

[3:51:57] beatdooown: Also this is a horrible comp for m+
[3:53:34] Strik3r019: they should change all these affix to give a positive along with what they r doing now. like for example when explosive gets killed u gain a 1% dps/heal buf for 10sec and stacks
[3:54:21] Nokterian: the renewed proto drake skin from razageth drops in LFR as well that is nice.
[3:54:32] AlphasaurusRexx: @Strik3r019 dps still wouldnt kill it =P

[4:13:53] FergusCreative: Whats wrong with dragon riding?
[4:13:53] tawney_owl_: but dragonriding is so much faster
[4:14:00] Teecay: I like to just autopilot to destinations
[4:14:01] Rudric_Ice: forums really hate dragonriding

[4:15:26] Rudric_Ice: get a glad boost man
[4:15:41] Nerdmeat_: @Rudric_Ice Forums hate everything
[4:15:45] wulfzor: they should have put more skins for sure. like KSM being a non flying mount in first flying expansion
[4:15:48] KingSlayerYotam: DR would be 100% better if it wouldnt take so long to recharge
[4:15:53] wulfzor: would have been much better if KSM was skin
[4:15:58] BravocadoBrad: sucks seeing everyone on the same 3 mounts
[4:16:03] AlphasaurusRexx: they need to open up the color palette a lot more and not restrict to 6 colors imo.
[4:16:06] Doohzyy: why would you hate dragonriding? have you ever went back to old zones and done 310%? feels like molasses
[4:16:07] GingerGambit: The only thing I don’t like about dragon riding, is that it makes other form of movement slow
[4:16:12] Strik3r019: nah i want to hover
[4:16:16] GeeEyeJoe: As a shaman, mouseover macro + frost shock, it's now a game of how fast and how many orbs can I break
[4:16:18] largefromage: aint got time fo dat
[4:16:20] all_the_tanks: Yea. I prefer dragon riding to the old style…but the old style is nice for “auto pilot”

[4:16:53] SugarSamoyed: farming mats with dragonriding is super fast too
[4:16:54] Doohzyy: yeah that would be nice
[4:17:00] Rudric_Ice: just like evokers ez
[4:17:21] faulen: I'd like the abitlity to train your old mounts to be dragon riders.
[4:17:22] largefromage: dron riding challenges worldwide for skins and goodies Pog
[4:17:23] olyv12: I enjoy using my other mounts. More options
[4:17:24] Mecabeast: I do miss afking in the air
[4:17:25] faulen: like a mini game
[4:17:28] jacnut: dragon riding is only good for flying to the flight point
[4:17:39] hammack52: if they increase the speed of reg flying to the same speed as dragon riding than dragon riding will be for nothing

[4:20:48] AlphasaurusRexx: @SollowJP the nerfs to the mobs yes, but they shadow nerfed dps brains so its about the same difficulty as last week

[4:55:08] Masqerader: lol
[4:55:11] hammack52: im a hunter and i dont need that bow so i would stay the whole time
[4:55:13] xxCameleon77xx: Why would they leave?
[4:55:14] RaginCajun05: that weapon is shit
[4:55:22] RaginCajun05: compared to the last boss
[4:55:28] beatdooown: i got bow fuck crossbow from eranog
[4:55:35] dreamwalker213: Eranog weapon is garbo especially on heroic
[4:55:38] Heero_Effect: Pugging is horrid
[4:55:48] Molvonos: Raid's in Normal btw
[4:55:51] wumba_the_chumba: true
[4:55:51] zysmos: The most annoying are people who leave after one wipe saying "i dont want to prog this"
[4:55:57] faulen: and the dps ring
[4:55:57] beatdooown: literally a bow from normal is better then heroic eranog weapon
[4:56:03] inj0shwetrust: For what the trinket?
[4:56:05] Sollice: Why would hnters want the first boss so bad?
[4:56:08] GingerGambit: The ring also for eranog could be a leaver
[4:56:12] watchthemgrow: My hunter got the heroic weapon off the weekly so - :D
[4:56:23] Sollice: For the crossbow? Go craft the bow
[4:56:28] watchthemgrow: *heroic raz weapon
[4:56:28] Sylphy_TV: LUL
[4:56:32] ArcaneMaki: I like this plan
[4:56:34] Masqerader: that fp should be account wide when u kill rasz on any char
[4:56:44] Scarhearth: Im just here to pump lol I had to swap to tanking for my guild so now my shaman is practically retired

[4:56:46] Nehcrom: towBook towBook towBook towBook
[4:56:46] beatdooown: Literally no hunter cares about heroic eranog crossbow
[4:56:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: arcane mage is pumping
[4:56:51] beatdooown: razz normal is a higher item level
[4:57:21] 3663Sharad: Because hunters are everywhere!
[4:57:22] 3663Sharad: KEKW
[4:57:23] beatdooown: HUNTER IS THE MOST COMMON SPEC IN THE GAME
[4:57:24] RaginCajun05: because they just have that many hunters out there
[4:57:24] inj0shwetrust: I got a 390  shadow priest with 4set
[4:57:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the hunters want some bow of Raz, yeah
[4:57:28] barrowzz: They want raz bow not egnong
[4:57:29] inj0shwetrust: not saved
[4:57:30] GingerGambit: aren't hunters one of the more popular classes?
[4:57:31] Plague_GG: I’m a hunter. I won’t leave. I promise.
[4:57:37] wulfzor: you want 402 lock? i can come
[4:57:57] inj0shwetrust: I got an eye exam in 30 mins though otherwise id join the cause

[4:58:36] holst23: Dh and lock
[4:58:37] Masqerader: DH and lick
[5:00:10] GingerGambit: left side all day
[5:00:17] hammack52: the only problem with hunter is that it is probably the most over played class
[5:00:51] GingerGambit: There should be an achievement for killing Eranog with the dragons in 2 minutes
[5:00:52] daconcion: Idk why they haven't introduced a skip for this yet
[5:00:57] Plague_GG: Prot warr ans rogues
[5:01:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: More shield slam procs does sound badass
[5:03:09] Tooyoo: prot warrior gets more out of windfury than fury warriors
[5:03:13] REDSUNDERGROUND: shield slam go brrrrr

[5:03:58] rampage1526: nope
