[3:02:06] Demanisraar: I also hear from some youtubers I follow that youtobe gaming is on it's ass. It's all shorts and low retention content
[3:02:09] abusted: Or it just means they made enough money to "retire"
[3:02:16] Tenivir: yeah more and more getting older and done it for long and i assume might want change

[3:02:45] Demanisraar: @Sebleh 6 months KEKW
[3:02:49] Sarcissa: mass dispel is a giga long CD now, so it's no longer the 'requirement'
[3:02:55] abusted: ^
[3:02:56] Sarcissa: I hope anyway
[3:03:02] Spiraljunky: In Osaka, Japan, if you finger gun people, the locals will pretend to be hit by it. It's just part of their comedy culture
[3:03:03] Sarcissa: Makes tanks/dps think more
[3:03:05] kittynyahn: but yeah, cd needs a nerf
[3:03:12] badactionhiro: The game theorist guy? I think he wants to do something else.
[3:03:16] kittynyahn: idek why its 2min long
[3:03:25] Demanisraar: @Spiraljunky That is so funny, I want to do that once in my life now LUL
[3:03:36] Sebleh: i wouldn’t mind if he’s gone naguuraSip
[3:03:44] Sebleh: i wouldn’t mind if several content creators retired tbh
[3:03:48] Sebleh: PepeLaugh
[3:03:58] kittynyahn: @Sebleh oh do spill :3c
[3:04:11] marcosvr: Well, being a streamer must be stressfull as fuck, so I kinda understand an early retirement
[3:04:13] Tenivir: yeah its just natural but its been around long enough now that retiring is gonna get more normal i guess
[3:04:22] kittynyahn: yay <3
[3:04:29] Tenivir: thats nice to hear LULW
[3:04:30] Kuroz: Aware
[3:04:30] Faramonde: naguuraCope naguuraCope

[3:08:00] gambleragain: my mom
[3:08:03] Sebleh: if he retires he’s just gonna work on the hours forever
[3:08:04] muchtar92: classic german
[3:08:08] Tenivir: yeah i know some old people that are similar, they wouldnt really know what else to do so might as well keep doing it
[3:08:13] Sanaubia: Teach her how to play wow
[3:08:22] gyrocentric: Damn
[3:08:24] kittynyahn: omg
[3:08:33] gyrocentric: She's keeping busy
[3:08:34] Sebleh: idk why I thought your dad worked at your mom’s place. what does your dad do?
[3:08:36] gambleragain: my mom works 7 to 23:00 as doctor
[3:08:43] kittynyahn: thats pretty good time-wise
[3:09:04] Tenivir: i mean that is nice if she enjoys it though
[3:09:07] Tenivir: having something to do
[3:09:07] kittynyahn: i think some people are workaholics but if it makes 'em happy, good for them x3
[3:09:15] hznter_: Urusaaa subscribed at Tier 1.

[3:09:26] Sebleh: Baguura
[3:09:31] Sebleh: Barguura*
[3:10:07] gambleragain: It's a bit sadistic isnt it?
[3:10:10] muchtar92: true
[3:10:11] kittynyahn: yeah...i just dont wanna offend anyone so i kinda of just say that, ah
[3:10:19] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[3:10:19] gyrocentric: Agreed Nsguura
[3:10:23] kittynyahn: japan and america work culture is really really sad
[3:10:24] Arthident: @Naguura it depends.. there is a generation of people who "life to work" while the generation after "works to life"
[3:10:27] Tenivir: Yeah it can def be seen both ways, you are so used to a hamster wheel that being outside it feels too strange
[3:10:28] gyrocentric: Naguura*

[3:10:51] Sebleh: do your mom’s friends have the same kind of free time you’re saying you wish she had?
[3:10:58] kittynyahn: mhms
[3:11:10] Sebleh: does your mom have enough money to sit down and hang out or travel actually retire peacefully and enjoy herself?
[3:11:17] gyrocentric: She invested too little time in friends
[3:11:29] Sebleh: maybe it’s a thing to keep herself in a habit
[3:11:33] gambleragain: work is where you find friends
[3:11:36] badactionhiro: Free time like soldering? naguuraBless
[3:11:44] Sarixz99: but thats what people have to do to surv
[3:11:48] y0rge: but in 2nd hand you need to provide cash to your family
[3:11:52] gyrocentric: Wish her well VoHiYo
[3:12:06] EvilBlunt420: AlienDance
[3:12:11] kittynyahn: not for me, i dont find friends in work
[3:12:13] kittynyahn: xdd
[3:12:24] gambleragain: I'm european, i've made plenty of friendships at my work place.
[3:12:28] Miromaaldis: 3 raiders from Miromaaldis have joined! 
[3:12:28] muchtar92: bro you dont find friends at work wtf xD
[3:12:32] kittynyahn: i call them "acquaintances" but thats me lmao
[3:12:47] volesus: Imagine spending more time per week with your colleagues than you already do
[3:12:57] violetsumire: I think it's the life of Asians.
[3:13:01] kittynyahn: @volesus NotLikeThis hellll no
[3:13:01] gambleragain: Well, your everyday activities decide where you find friends.
[3:13:12] gambleragain: And if you work for 8 hours its bound to happen there.
[3:13:13] muchtar92: would be the same sad story as before ;O
[3:13:23] Miromaaldis: 1 raiders from Miromaaldis have joined! 
[3:13:27] Execrable1: in the US, management tries to gaslight us into thinking work is our family so we will do things like work extra for free
[3:13:37] kittynyahn: ive met most of mine online oddly, but i kind of like it that way though i do miss hanging out in person with a best friend
[3:13:46] Tenivir: usually the best friends are found through hobbies and whatnot done in free time, atleast imo
[3:13:59] ninah_wtf: I think your mom could absolutely adapt a new hobby even at like 60 years old if she wanted to just not work anymore, my friends dad was like that, working all day everyday and now he spends his hard earned money on a rock band he joined LUL
[3:14:26] gambleragain: what does SM do there?
[3:14:28] gambleragain: new to M+
[3:14:45] kittynyahn: me when i get crushed by boulder in brh when it clips me x_x
[3:15:03] Sebleh: we are your work friends nagoogoo
[3:15:09] Sebleh: that’s why you hate all your work friends YEP
[3:15:09] itsClubby: I mean you do have work friends its just not as frequent as office workers
[3:15:14] gyrocentric: Ummm hello? Us? We're your friends naguuraHypers
[3:15:14] gambleragain: Don't get me wrong. I have made enemies at my work place.
[3:15:29] kittynyahn: O_O
[3:15:31] bummmr: yea enemies are easier, lets stick to that
[3:15:36] NipeArcade: You just said you missed Alex. Isn't he technically your work friend?
[3:15:43] gambleragain: and plenty of friends at the age of 30 for me is like 3 people max.
[3:15:48] itsClubby: honestly who hurt Lewis Capaldi, this guy makes me cry with every song of his
[3:15:49] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and 10.2 guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:16:29] violentmeme: sometimes co-workers just don't make good friends. Not every place I worked at had people I connected with -- but I worked well with them.
[3:16:31] kittynyahn: i always thought a goal in high keys was like 0 deaths but having a few like this makes me feel better about my own mistakes a bit
[3:17:03] Tenivir: it can be more about minimizing the time impact of any deaths
[3:17:09] Tenivir: time wise
[3:17:28] kittynyahn: nodnod
[3:17:31] gambleragain: the downfall of workplace friendships is finding new jobs and firing people
[3:17:36] gambleragain: and you lose touch
[3:17:55] Sebleh: nah that’s legot
[3:17:58] Sebleh: legit*
[3:18:16] LFECO: Hey
[3:18:27] kittynyahn: *gibs chat blueberry smoothie* c:
[3:18:30] Sebleh: I got my oldest friend a job where I worked and he was awful at it. caused a huge rift in our friendship because I was in charge of him and he was really bad at the job but I also couldn’t find anyone to replace him.
[3:18:58] gambleragain: @Trixee89 you're right, but it seems you havent foudn true friends
[3:19:17] llennybot: that kind of person is not your friend tbh
[3:19:28] llennybot: if they cant be happy for you dont be with them
[3:19:30] Lenietwitch: you have real life friends ? , must be nice naguuraFBM
[3:19:35] badactionhiro: Going to happy hour with coworkers after work not a thing in Europe?
[3:19:43] Tenivir: yeah true
[3:19:56] gambleragain: you have to be pragmatic and separate work from friends
[3:20:06] violentmeme: I have a handful of RL friends outside of work and I've known them forever... at work when you leave a job it's hard to keep those "friends" because they didn't come to you with the same energy as your outside work friends
[3:20:07] Tenivir: got friends that would do nothing but frustrate me if i tried doing actual work with them
[3:20:13] itsClubby: they wont last long as friends I think

[3:27:34] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[3:27:44] gambleragain: well you can say, i will pay you, then dont pay them if they dont do it
[3:27:44] kittynyahn: yeah its so unorganised and untruthful
[3:27:49] kittynyahn: NotLikeThis
[3:27:49] Sebleh: scripe is out of touch with the average wow player. his take only works for world first raiders
[3:27:50] bummmr: welcome to construction industry

[6:30:16] colingoodwin: oh nooo da cameraaa
[6:30:19] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[6:30:26] colingoodwin: get Razer to sponsor you and send you their new one haha
[6:30:28] Sebleh: seblehPhone good bye camera
[6:30:36] colingoodwin: do you have mods?? get at them!!

[6:30:51] colingoodwin: send them this clip LOLOL
[6:31:08] xArcesius: take it apart and see
[6:31:17] Alarius_: technical difficulties lol
[6:31:19] Sebleh: maybe your camera hates you so much it’s killing your pc naguuraSip
[6:31:29] Spartany25: one day we'll do keys again LUL
[6:31:31] Kuroz: it was battery related before
[6:31:38] Kuroz: at least the first time around
[6:31:39] SirDSD: who nthe critique we watching?
[6:31:54] Kuroz: ye
[6:31:59] OviTheGray: camera fixing stream soon?
[6:32:12] Vendrek: Personally prefer everything to be hardwired over battery powered. Hate wireless mice.
[6:32:29] Alarius_: isnt the dummy just to fool the camera into thinking a battery is present even tho its on a dedicated power source?
[6:32:38] Sebleh: did you get a new dummy battery when you got this camera back?
[6:32:38] LesterOfSmeg2: if your battery is running out . you should put it on a leash.
[6:32:51] Sebleh: because it could just be the battery is old and dying randomly or overheating
[6:33:21] Sebleh: seblehHmm
[6:33:21] Kuroz: time to go back to blame the capture card once again Kappa
[6:33:23] Alarius_: maybe overheating
[6:33:52] Alarius_: capture card is working cause it shows that error message on the stream, right?
[6:33:53] amorandra: Is it a new camera
[6:34:03] Alarius_: yea i think its camera related
[6:34:04] Sebleh: maybe check and make sure there’s no option enabled that it turns off after so much time
[6:34:39] Sebleh: well maybe it’s when you sit still
[6:34:51] Sebleh: but idk I haven’t really paid attention to what you’re doing when it shuts off
[6:34:52] NkKouros: Power supply issue (?)
[6:34:56] amorandra: Can you tell us the camera model?
[6:34:57] Alarius_: overheating is my guess
[6:35:03] Kuroz: !cam
[6:35:03] StreamElements: Sony Alpha 7 mark III with a Tamron 17-28 mm lens .    2nd cam : Elgato Facecam full HD - Sony Alpha 6300 until I fix the main cam
[6:35:03] Sebleh: but it could be it decides it doesn’t sense any movement and it shuts off
[6:35:46] Sebleh: well you said dummy battery cable? is that new too or just the battery? also new doesn’t mean free from fault naguuraSip
[6:35:49] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and 10.2 guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:36:01] Kuroz: it did
[6:36:10] Sebleh: true
[6:36:13] Sebleh: wait
[6:36:15] Guilleeee: time to solder another cam?
[6:36:26] Alarius_: blow a fan on it lol
[6:36:29] Sebleh: what if you accidentally melted some kind of temperature regulator when you hit it with the hot air gun
[6:36:34] amorandra: The mark iii has been known to do that as it wasn't really built for streaming.
[6:36:35] Jarlan23: i think asmongold has a cooling pad or something for his camera. his camera used to die like that
[6:36:38] shoddybuzz: put a fan on the camera
[6:36:44] Sebleh: and now the new camera is fucked too PepeLaugh
[6:36:45] amorandra: the mark iv has better heat sink
[6:36:56] JohnAllenCasts: cameras do just be getting hot tho
[6:37:03] amorandra: put a little usb fan on it
[6:37:06] Alarius_: if the room is warm then the camera will be even hotter
[6:37:15] Kuroz: it's the sony 6300 now, the mark 3 is getting repaired
[6:37:17] Kuroz: post soldering
[6:37:41] JohnAllenCasts: I think the temerature radiation between two mediums is proportional to the square of their temperature difference so a few degrees warmer room will mess with it quite a lot I guess
[6:37:50] Alarius_: well it uses what it has for cooling, cameras dont have fans in them for cooling, so heatsinks use ambient air for dissipation
[6:37:51] LesterOfSmeg2: getting hotter because you are looking extra amazing today
[6:38:00] Guilleeee: naguuraNotes
[6:38:39] Alarius_: yea circulation lol
[6:38:40] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:38:57] JohnAllenCasts: just custom build a liquid cooling loop for your camera
[6:39:06] Sebleh: @johnallencasts you are not accounting for draft from air circulation in the room and how open or closed the camera is to its surroundings and the temperature delta between the inside of the room and the outside temperature and neighboring room temperatures.
[6:39:07] Kuroz: dyson fan just for the cam
[6:39:13] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:39:28] Alarius_: prayge the camera gets repaired fast lol
[6:39:36] sim967: get Linus tech tips to custom made liquid cooling for your camera

[6:40:21] amorandra: There should be an Auto Power Off setting - check if that's High
[6:40:29] mika01: who dis lady ?
[6:40:31] amorandra: Toolbox menu
[6:40:37] Kuroz: !bernadette
[6:40:37] StreamElements: https://www.youtube.com/@bernadettebanner
[6:40:40] JohnAllenCasts: @Sebleh the only delta that matters is the cam to ambient temp. Those other things just affect the ambient. The only metric that matters is the heat leaving the camera

[6:41:11] pottm: when hades stream
[6:41:20] Kuroz: soon tm
[6:41:23] Kuroz: variety streamer arc
[6:41:25] sim967: how did we come to be watching a video about corsets?
[6:41:26] JohnAllenCasts: triangle aesthetic
[6:41:31] Sebleh: nah because the room temp will also depend on her activity, the pc/component heat radiation, and the neighboring rooms.
[6:41:32] Kuroz: and you changed idea 20 minutes later
[6:41:33] Sebleh: wait hades
[6:41:34] pottm: entschuldigom
[6:41:36] Sebleh: ?
[6:41:41] Kuroz: you said 1 hour bg3 then just keys
[6:41:50] Sebleh: bro Naguura you should 100% play hades. it’s Greek gods but hot
[6:41:58] Kuroz: and then you said keys until 5
[6:42:01] pottm: hades hades hades
[6:42:07] Kuroz: that's why I didn't remind you
[6:42:09] Kuroz: can clip
[6:42:14] Kuroz: naguuraCope
[6:42:15] Sebleh: you definitely said it
[6:42:18] Sebleh: I was here for it

[6:42:29] JohnAllenCasts: NO

[6:44:38] Burnprof: hmm, photoshop, have you thought about editing the videos, so that you actually fixed the camera?
[6:44:39] mika01: a chemise is a shirt
[6:44:39] Sebleh: chemise like a shirt I guess?
[6:44:41] JohnAllenCasts: its like a slip/blouse
[6:44:53] Sebleh: camisa is Spanish for shirt and it sounds similar.
[6:45:04] Sebleh: so I have to assume it’s related naguuraSip
[6:45:07] Alarius_: sewing stream
