[3:19:41] Coldstyle: they really should get rid of lockout ID's
[3:19:45] wizzo4: idk if i have a choice to do a 30 min gnomer vs a 2 hour...
[3:19:46] Tetrabud: takes less effort to raid lead if people know what theyre doing
[3:19:47] simzz9999: If you havent clear there is huge chance you are bad player
[3:19:48] doofeeneed: @Graycen like needing a 2 year clerical job for a typing job despite me being on wow 13 hours a day

[3:20:15] vgameplayer: what did you see
[3:20:17] doofeeneed: i wish there were saved lock outs
[3:20:19] HappysFunPalace: dungeons should be 1 boss each and have multiple dungeons NODDERS
[3:20:21] doofeeneed: so you can prog on bosses

[3:20:52] HappysFunPalace: make multiple raids with 1 boss so its more accesibble
[3:20:53] Coldstyle: agreed, thats what asmon suggested too
[3:20:56] evanskies: is it true that in retail you can run raids again but you just won’t get loot drops?
[3:21:02] vgameplayer: come out
