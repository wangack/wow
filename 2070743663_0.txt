[2:53:47] StreamElements: @saund In World of Warcraft Tidal Charm is a rare trinket that stuns an enemy for 3 seconds It drops from Prince Nazjak in the Arathi Highlands It's a popular item for PvP players

[2:55:00] StreamElements: @nezqwiK Tidal Charm in WoW Classic can be situationally useful in certain PvP scenarios but it has limited effectiveness overall and may not be the best trinket choice for every situation

[2:55:21] StreamElements: @NotASkiller Generalizing all EU gamers as cheaters is unfair and untrue Every region has its share of cheaters It might seem like it's always them due to a few high-profile cases getting more attention
