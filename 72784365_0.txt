[0:00:50] Syrekroth: @Zulkuss I understand that, the thing is they didn't only want to use big known weapons. The Truncheon was a pretty big lore weapon tied to Gorefiend. Blizzard brought a different weapon to light with this because this Artifact System is a way to get more weapons known like Frostmourne, Ashbringer, Aetish, Tfury, and Gorefiend's Truncheon.

[0:44:15] Revenar: @warcraft With the changes to class/specilizations in Legion, many people have felt like their characters they've played for years are suddenly underpowered and/or incomplete. Are there any plans to look at and adjust these changes and possibly restore some of the skills you have taken away?
[0:44:17] Hamarah: a question i have for the devs is if wow tokens will ever be given to the player base ot control the price rather than the system estimating the price based on supply and demand algorithms

[0:50:12] ZohAn77: What is Titanforged ?
[0:50:12] capitalmayhem: @Warcraft - You created a 2nd Talent Tree, to add abilities for PVP. Now, the main Talent Tree is still being effected by PVP. Question is: Why not split the first Talent Tree COMPLETELY? You have Talents that are directed towards PVP, and same with PVE. When changes are needed for the PVP talent side, it will not effect the PVE side. Vise Versa

[1:13:41] SaphyrieL: @Warcraft - Will you make tank dps less of a thing? I think is kinda ridiculous that a tank outdps or outheals most of the other classes in most scenarios.
[1:13:42] Santeka: no one did it bc it required to run 0 melee dps

[1:13:53] gerrardbuttler: i dont know if you talked about it already, but, what are you going do with the Hellfire tier set bonus for legion? as some spells are removed like Chimera Shot for MM hunter.
[1:13:53] BG3K: Blizzard only hires white people
[1:13:55] toocagow: Oh thank god atleast 1 mod is here @Elbareth
[1:13:55] TheFabilolz: Meatloaph, why do u go play Wakfu or LoL instead of being negative and PJSalt ?
