[0:52:06] alexbilbaoo: we need rbgs at 60
[0:52:13] hobbehesu: The best memories from raiding in WoW are from wiping and failing, untill you eventually get it as a group. It's team based, people treat it like Skyrim
[0:52:13] Xolido: @wmac8 ok awesome thanks man - SP still op in pvp ?

[1:02:07] Rejuvenate: for another server.
[1:02:51] prodigy_wow: Scroll of cryoblast + max int spell power gear = one shot outside of bg
[1:03:03] falconsfan777: ion cannon build and snipe top KBs on other team
[1:03:14] prodigy_wow: With arcane power it's extra I think
[1:03:15] StingoX: yo ziqo. what couch you picked in the end? :)

[1:06:21] shaggy462: @Rejuvenate Only issue with that is those servers might go they way of chaos bolt. CS has the benefit of streamer pop i guess
[1:06:25] skarniks: old video
[1:06:36] aultymalganis: hi gm Z
[1:06:42] HexedPk: ziqo any new alts you will play with lvling xp buff inc
[1:06:46] deadly22: ziq what times do you do gnomer
[1:06:47] Rejuvenate: @shaggy462 oh nah, I don't think 60k players are randomly going to vanish. Chaos Bolt has maybe 10k. Big, big difference.
[1:07:29] deadly22: is it your guild?
[1:07:33] waskaie: what times/days is the tournament
[1:07:34] dicapriyo: ur full bis gnomer anyway

[1:07:52] shaggy462: @Rejuvenate Yeah you could be right, but historically most move to the bigger pop server as time goes on (so many dead servers in classic 4 years ago come to mind)
[1:08:03] 0wins: How do you remember all the retail abilities when casting?
[1:08:06] moistspeedo: mage doesnt looks very fun
[1:08:09] Rejuvenate: @shaggy462 just need it to last for 1 year.
[1:08:11] Speyto: oof

[1:11:01] zzzzzzerozzzzzz: and recently again 10%
[1:11:02] shaggy462: when they nerfed SWD they buffed void plague by like 10% or so
[1:11:07] daLuhz: there was no reason to buff void plague by another 10% when they nerfed swd
[1:11:11] juchaz: priest is like a mop class, heals dots, burst, defensive, 2 cc
[1:11:13] waskaie: lol

[1:45:26] iinthebushes: everyone is too caught up on the meta
[1:45:26] davepoon2: Talking about classic or retail?
[1:45:38] nosefinger: I never wipe, i just shake it extra good before flushing
[1:45:39] okkuzenman: yeah the gatekeeping is insane. My melee hunter is bricked cus bad logs since I was forced to range and bombs etc.. leveling my third healer now instead
[1:45:44] iinthebushes: ill see groups spend hours looking for a feral
[1:45:45] bobgrey69: its not at all
[1:45:52] crainiam: gnomer is a joke
[1:45:53] awkwor_d: anyone with Wbuffs wouldnt wanna wipe, your point makes no sense
[1:46:02] USION_BOLT: World Buffs makes people anxious af
[1:46:04] jallaballan: Its also a beta male mentality
[1:46:05] mr_az3k: ya do the basic mechanics its ez clear with 200 dps lol
[1:46:06] OptimusPrimePleb: the best raids are with a bunch of ppl in their 30's who are drunk and/or stoned in a discord call, change my mind
[1:46:06] bobgrey69: neckbeards treating it like sunwell
[1:46:10] davepoon2: Not a classic andy, but there is noway "raids" in SoD are being gatekept? its legit for every1 and their grandmother
[1:46:11] bobgrey69: id rathher just lvl
[1:46:25] karlthepimp: its been like this for years lol
[1:46:46] bobgrey69: gnomer its been at an all time high tho
[1:46:49] privategravy: who is playing today in awc, NA?
[1:46:49] houstontx281: Haven't been able to join one gnomer bc I don't have "logs"

[1:46:56] Alientwitch: feels like noone is here to enjoy the game, just to sweat
[1:46:57] bobgrey69: its season of logs
[1:46:59] bobbybigbuxx: BUT YOU HAD HEART
[1:47:03] bobgrey69: dont do a raid if theyre logging
[1:47:05] paco__gutierrez: Just have good logs and it wouldn't even be a problem Kappa
[1:47:09] eaksyn: week 1 only good people were ready to raid tho
[1:47:10] bobgrey69: they need to delete the log site
[1:47:10] steinis2k: i kinnda agree, but i also disagree, like i want to be careful who i bring cus i don't wanna get hardstuck on a boss for hours because someone just plain decliunes to learn the game
[1:47:11] kiddevill: The raids are so easy that parses are the only thing that most players aim for i think
[1:47:21] bobgrey69: srry im venting
[1:47:22] S0ulbind: no one is pugging hype classes their friends/guildies are playing
[1:47:22] unsccessful: @Ziqoftw are the competitors allowed to stream today without delay, or no since Warcraft will be streaming it
[1:47:27] Weddzz: think its more about wanting ppl to put in the same amount of effort, preperatione etc, but yes - not that it's needed
[1:47:42] OptimusPrimePleb: I for one have never died in a video game, dunno why people get so mad about it Shrugeg
[1:47:52] unsccessful: king ty
[1:47:52] Coalmanite_: just play a healer. everyone wants a healer.
[1:47:56] grubols: bro every group I have that falls apart is t bc we can’t clear but cuz one mf can’t stfu and stop being a dick
[1:48:20] shaggy462: @Coalmanite_ also spellcasters, seen a lot of mage/spriest being wanted too
[1:48:31] Dancheek: they're LEVELING RAIDS
[1:48:34] Dancheek: jfc
[1:48:35] Coalmanite_: true I feel bad for melee
[1:48:38] Dancheek: people need to touch grass
[1:48:39] eaksyn: gnomer is too hard for random pugs tho
[1:48:46] bobgrey69: if u are melee u have already rerolled
[1:48:47] convrge: they're easy honestly..just have to have somewhat of a brain
[1:48:53] steinis2k: that last boss isn't easy at all if you pug tbh xD
[1:48:54] Yokedo: I have 3
[1:48:58] shaggy462: ive not seen a group ask for melee in a while, its all ranged dps lol
[1:49:05] Ballprint: what is AWC
[1:49:07] Ira_Oak: KEKW 0 heals
[1:49:07] luzid7: the Probleme are not bad player the Probleme are the player that leav after 1 wipe and only cry the whole time …
[1:49:07] Ballprint: All we clothes?
[1:49:09] Ballprint: send pics
[1:49:10] jallaballan: They need to start banning these toxic sweaters
[1:49:28] hulkdieselx: as easy as it is, the classic community has really terrible players. i dont blame anyone who has repect for their own time and would rather not wipe with shitters for 2 hours
[1:49:30] x_jdot: cant you spam wing clip for windfury procs as melee hunter
[1:49:33] steinis2k: yeah im not saying it isn't possible but SOME people in this game just plain declines to learn
[1:49:34] oakleafresin: i hate or on Wolf mount  : / get Kodo bro
[1:49:37] eaksyn: ziqo hasn't met the bad pugs yet
[1:49:42] rankjuann: You have the FaP mechanic phase 2 aswell
[1:49:48] rankjuann: to avoid freeze
[1:49:50] shaggy462: do you think its raid design? gnomer is a little melee unfriendly, so therefore players will bring less melee
[1:49:54] Kahrn_27: preach brother
[1:49:58] grubols: ppl think it’s hard cuz everyone in their group stops trying once they get called a r*** every other second
[1:50:01] steinis2k: like last raid i had, people just didn't kick and this one guy summoned 15 lava elementals
[1:50:02] pralwir: You get good shi from pvp?
[1:50:06] bobgrey69: no ur right ziqo
[1:50:08] bobgrey69: its bad man
[1:50:08] Grimstr1ke: amazing playlist bro, where i can find it?
[1:50:09] unsccessful: Frequent Fapper here Kappa
[1:50:13] dicapriyo: if u have decent dmg frost debuff dont matter lol it stacks to 1 andb oss phases
[1:50:14] oakleafresin: i never fap as healer in gnomer. World #37
[1:50:27] MezeiPoloska: as a rogue i still couldnt get into gnomer, not once :D
[1:50:27] griffski_: people demanding FAPs are the groups hes talking about gating btw
[1:50:32] rankjuann: I am a rogue so my PoV is different
[1:50:41] steinis2k: yeah no fap isn't a must at all
