[0:08:59] danger_daft: hey whats up Ven, playing that vers frost mage build and it feels great tbh
[0:09:04] Trickymaster: Guess it is
[0:09:35] heymomimonttv: i tried frost bolt build yesterday and idk if i'm dumb but it seems weak af compared to glacial build
[0:09:36] Wrathbb1: the worst is when you make a new password and didnt realize you had caps on
[0:09:52] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy TheSlipperySailor WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:09:55] Meadamemnon: I use Bitwarden though for a secure password vault. So I really only need to remember one password
[0:10:10] NovaSun84: lizzWhat this sounds crazy
[0:10:16] Trickymaster: gg
[0:10:23] Meadamemnon: This isn't going to end well
[0:10:24] bollskis: whats your pw ill try for you

[0:11:51] Trickymaster: so iHateDH?
[0:11:58] danger_daft: @Trickymaster isnt that all of our passwords
[0:12:03] Wrathbb1: what I think is really dumb is that companies dont just use the GW2 password method: no symbols or numbers required. You just pick 4 words that are not related and it is guraunteed more secure than any password under 10 digits
[0:12:05] Trickymaster: haha
[0:12:26] danger_daft: lul thanks for the account

[0:13:08] Wrathbb1: @heymomimonttv its easy its crazy
[0:13:16] Wrathbb1: only password i have ever remembered
[0:13:49] fireruler96: @venruki , with your years of expedience in pvp, what are your thoughts on the current season? good ,bad, or in between?
[0:14:09] Wrathbb1: i can go for YEARS without logging intro GW2 (cause it sucks) but cannot forget my password lol
[0:14:23] danger_daft: gw2 is pretty bad
[0:14:35] heymomimonttv: on full vers frost mage, you play frost bolt instead of glacial right? how do you make it pump?
[0:14:45] likeewlock: played a toon after 2 weeks shuffle had 7 mmr more
[0:14:55] skarny1: they desperately need to fix inflation the game feels dead if you're using LFG
[0:15:03] heymomimonttv: nah i have the buld but the dmg seems lackluster af
[0:15:30] revvilan: is there a way or tool to contextualize arena performance in percentiles? to help figure out where you are performing independent of season inflation?
[0:16:05] heymomimonttv: frostbolt never seems to hit as hard as a lance tho?
[0:16:26] heymomimonttv: ah, i havent seen frostbolt hit for more than 90k yet with that build lol
[0:16:31] danger_daft: Shatter frost bomb, full cryopathy ray itself is like 1m damage lol
[0:16:41] Wrathbb1: @skarny1 it was fixed. PvP was amazing. Then they reworked ret and absolutely killed the reblooming community lol
[0:16:51] Wrathbb1: S1 last two weeks never forget
[0:17:24] bruce_t_wayne: yo ven, have you fullfilled your valentine duties for today already?
[0:17:28] mvpala_tv: yo ill run it
[0:17:46] danger_daft: I like glacial with the build, Frost bomb, Glacial Full cryo ray  = death
[0:17:55] heymomimonttv: bring jackie in, let
[0:18:03] heymomimonttv: lets ask her if you fulfilled ur duties

[0:36:45] bruce_t_wayne: @heymomimonttv ok thanks for the reply then theres def something wrong haha
[0:36:52] sllvrbck: I’d leave too if I felt like I was sucking lol (not saying he does though)
[0:36:56] Ditysalad: I feel like a lot of streamers are only playing classic for the views
[0:37:06] bigslawomir1: yes
[0:37:17] wowsuomi: Icc in wrath
[0:37:26] HexedPk: premades are gone now
[0:37:30] HexedPk: thats why
[0:37:31] bigslawomir1: its too simple and "easy"
[0:37:35] heymomimonttv: classic pvp is so ass compared to retail
[0:37:38] gelatokush: im glad u dont play curling, its so bad Kappa
[0:37:46] jporter_: I had fun oneshotting people with lavaburst, that was it
[0:37:49] NovaSun84: was the healing too OP as mage?  lizzCool
[0:37:50] Axtin: we should find the vod of you in that wsg

[0:38:39] Axtin: its like feral destro, kick 1 guy other guy 1v3s
[0:39:19] Kujo_XX: Can anyone help me process the logic that is leaving DH an outrageous outlier for the entire expansion?
[0:39:26] NovaSun84: wotlk will always be my xpac.  I'm hoping that they splinter on cata release to separate, but I'm thinking it won't happen.
[0:39:31] addyz0r: aoe deepfreeze Pog
[0:39:57] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: You and Pikaboo last two retail loyalists left standing lol!
[0:39:59] gelatokush: 400k glacials, 350k frost bombs, 150k ice lance be tckling
[0:40:02] heymomimonttv: @NovaSun84 they are absolutely not splintering cata from wotlk, sorry to break it to you. the game is fragmented enough as is
[0:40:18] Nateypww: I love venruki!
[0:40:41] heymomimonttv: i hit a 360k glacial yesterday
[0:41:10] Axtin: lol if theres one thing thatll never change its people exaggerating how hard abilities hit in wow
[0:41:38] gelatokush: ok exagerating but saying frost is small numbers is false tho i like the size of numbers on frost mage not talking about overall dmg tho
[0:41:39] heymomimonttv: i will say my glacials are usually 280k ish, everything must've lined up perfectly for that 360k
[0:41:41] flyingorangee: idk why but i like frostbolt build lot more than glacial one with all other dmg buttons
[0:41:48] thisisthotcaller: yeah a sniper shot hit me for 3 billion damage the other day. Not even a lie
[0:42:02] heymomimonttv: @thisisthotcaller i was there, i was the sniper shot
[0:42:13] gelatokush: flurry is underwhelming your so right
[0:42:16] nikthevoker: buff evoker, 430k eternity surge not enough!
[0:42:34] nuggetzwarr123: im going to gear one of my alts as a healer now, i guess shaman is more rewarding than druid?
[0:42:37] Merkflare: gimmicks are hard against good players
[0:42:44] gdodmebxu: @nuggetzwarr123 both are best healers by a mile
[0:42:47] tangdill: This could dbe you and xaryu
[0:42:48] Merkflare: and really fun against noobs
[0:42:52] tangdill: But mount didnt drop
[0:43:44] gelatokush: frost is def more fun at low elo
[0:44:08] imkizzo: is there any way to get rid of the 40 pets nameplates I get in every solo shuffle game?
[0:44:26] tangdill: Thats ghoodd?
[0:44:38] tangdill: I dont play retail
[0:44:44] tangdill: I askedd thats good?
[0:44:49] gelatokush: u would compare lance to what ability fro ma lock or boomy for example
[0:44:54] heymomimonttv: thats similar to lava burst, the difference is you dont have 100% uptime for that
[0:44:54] danger_daft: 25 minutes for a double prot pally ss game wow
[0:44:58] tangdill: How is disc priest atm
[0:45:10] NovaSun84: max health is only 50k for players in retail right?  carmelaKappa
[0:45:13] eceria: Frost needs flat damage buff for 15%
[0:45:41] tangdill: Crazy how they reset the health, and now we back at 1mill health again
[0:45:54] tangdill: Blizzard keeps on repeating the bad dhabbits
[0:46:02] danger_daft: Ice lance can hit hard though, 150k sometimes
[0:46:04] gdodmebxu: hp doesn't matter
[0:46:08] danger_daft: shatter/crit
[0:46:11] NovaSun84: oh EZ just 10 magic crits in a row.  Sounds like a good hit on the slot machine infinitely to win.
[0:46:18] gelatokush: too much ilvl scaling between patchs
[0:46:39] tangdill: @gdodmebxu Its ugly, to so high numbers. there is litterly no point to it
[0:46:50] gdodmebxu: no point either way KEKW
[0:46:54] FelQueen: Actually you have 100k lance every gcd is op
[0:47:09] gdodmebxu: hp values have no bearing on how hard the game is to balance
[0:47:19] gelatokush: lance hits almost as hard as starsurge on average
[0:47:44] Shakeboxing: gm ven
[0:47:45] tangdill: H ow is disc priest atm
[0:47:47] addyz0r: COPIUM
[0:47:55] walokki: ice lance is not strong
[0:47:56] satirically1: problem is it feels too much like pad vs actually killing someone, i feel the same with ele and lava burst
[0:48:06] gelatokush: chaos bolts hits on average 100-130k
[0:48:11] jporter_: do you think there will be patch notes before the EUvsNA
[0:48:14] gdodmebxu: @gelatokush no it doesn't
[0:48:17] Reiumi_: D:
[0:48:19] swervelolxx: I feel like frostmage isnt it for 2s anymore always arcane and firemage was the move from hansols perspective
[0:48:23] gelatokush: its does
[0:48:24] Reiumi_: quitter Madge
[0:48:28] heymomimonttv: @satirically1 this is a big reason i stopped playing ele recently after 3 seasons
[0:48:44] gdodmebxu: @gelatokush you're never chaos bolting before applying the debuff with instant cast
[0:48:46] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[0:48:55] heymomimonttv: @gelatokush only if you're casting chaos bolts when you shouldnt be lol
[0:49:01] gdodmebxu: ^
[0:49:11] heymomimonttv: ask xaryu to play 2s
[0:49:13] swolecolemole: feel like you only q into arcane feral or arcane outlaw at high mmr, frost and fire basically no representation
[0:49:17] heymomimonttv: reel him back into retail
[0:49:34] driftwood_tc: My mom stopped by today with a homemade lasagna widepeepoHappy
[0:49:54] Nateypww: everyone is just playing full haste trying to min max global doing no damage try to play mastery and actually kill things with your icicles and comet storm
[0:49:56] NovaSun84: zoewreRiot Axtin not queuing atm
[0:50:15] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[0:50:25] gelatokush: u really need hate o ncaster
[0:50:31] gdodmebxu: casting kicked casting stunned casting
[0:50:34] gelatokush: now more then ever feel like
[0:50:39] NovaSun84: how good are those sheeps though.
[0:50:43] gelatokush: everyone has 40% haste lol
[0:50:48] ferahgok: @Nateypww I tried the same on my boomy. Big starsurges but you can get 0 clones and as a result just die over time. Had to go back haste
[0:50:52] Insertname4321: Honestly bro just take casters out of the game why are they here EZ
[0:51:05] Nateypww: I haven’t played since season 2 of DF
[0:51:07] gdodmebxu: only class should be dh Kappa
[0:51:07] heymomimonttv: bad romance is lowkey a banger
[0:51:08] varok87: This is Suppa Hunter lol
[0:51:21] Nateypww: I am Ktp I got 3300 In solo shuffle mastery
[0:51:25] Insertname4321: The only class that matters is DK
[0:51:25] Nateypww: like Mitch jones style
[0:52:23] Nateypww: so awkward playing low haste but idk why people keep trying to be a ele sham no one is actually doing damage as mage just dampening it feels like (as frost)
[0:52:38] gdodmebxu: because you can't play the game with 0 haste
[0:52:47] Nateypww: frost is just a worse ele, destro nowadays
[0:52:54] gdodmebxu: need at least enough to db ring/sheep
[0:52:58] BMaStream: BMaStream subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Happy V-Day
[0:52:59] gdodmebxu: otherwise why even play mage
[0:53:13] jporter_: Ven, where do you track your skyreach?
[0:53:30] Shakeboxing: LoS his healer, buff dh brain
[0:53:48] Nateypww: I’m not the best player in the world but I have a decent idea of what’s going on lol
[0:54:00] heymomimonttv: @Nateypww ele is not even comparable to frost or destro. very different playstyles
[0:55:31] Nateypww: https://check-pvp.fr/us/Tichondrius/Ktp like I said I’m not the best player ever and haven’t played since season 2 of DF
[0:55:56] logikol: is arcane good enough atm?
[0:56:04] Nateypww: I’m a lfg Andy :)
[0:56:11] amtrash112: bro why did you link my armory?
[0:56:39] soddi: the hunter just took the L like a man
[0:56:48] varok87: @soddi Yeah xD
[0:56:49] heymomimonttv: is there any way to see previous season rating distributions in solos?
[0:56:49] BMaStream: I just woke up Ven how are you man
[0:56:53] ferahgok: @Nateypww The game is more damp and slower now than previous seasons, can't get away with the one shots as easy
[0:56:57] heymomimonttv: to see how 1800 compares to previous seasons
[0:57:16] gdodmebxu: different meta now
[0:57:21] Symo85: Symo85 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:57:26] chancywilson: are you healing or dps'ing?
[0:57:28] Divinized: whats up ruki!
[0:57:35] DouzySham: but also 99% of high rated SPs were not doing whatever Wiz was doing, apparently they were wrong
[0:57:41] gelatokush: mastery scaling is pretty bad on frost mage also
[0:57:57] gdodmebxu: @DouzySham actually he switched to 4 set after refusing to play it
[0:58:04] chancywilson: @DouzySham was wiz haste or mastery
[0:58:05] gdodmebxu: not really true
[0:58:19] jackobson917: sid say he want to uninstall the game XD
[0:58:24] Divinized: i just started playing destro warlock this class is fucking nutty lol
[0:58:33] babilho: supacheese with the MM hunter
[0:58:36] DouzySham: @chancywilson I think he went all in mastery for a bit and did crazy well, then switched back to haste for AWC or something?
[0:58:40] raspador: that hunter will say healer foul
[0:58:44] heymomimonttv: @chancywilson wiz is full haste with mind spike. alot of sp seem to use flay
[0:58:51] chancywilson: ty
[0:59:00] Nateypww: that is fair
[0:59:11] danger_daft: Mind spike is nice for more than 1 spell school
[0:59:18] chancywilson: I just wish it was as easy to get rating on healer as it is DPS
[0:59:19] gdodmebxu: most sp play mindspike
[0:59:20] chancywilson: its backwards
[0:59:21] gdodmebxu: unless demo splay
[0:59:36] gelatokush: nah all good pvp sp use mindspiek because mindspike is shadowforst and mind flay is shadow so having spike is a clear advantage of gaining one school of magic
[0:59:42] crawnpocktail: @chancywilson ngl as a healer main i farm rating so much faster in SS on healer
[0:59:43] NightMunchies: good morning ven? Did u watch the Game last night?
[0:59:49] heymomimonttv: @gdodmebxu alot of the builds i was looking at had flay. i have 3 copied builds with flay and only 1 with spike
[1:00:03] gdodmebxu: yeah but what you see their talents as is not necessarily what they're playing in pvp
[1:00:07] chancywilson: @crawnpocktail IDK how you heal these 2.2 dps that dont press buttons
[1:00:11] gdodmebxu: and they change builds in game
[1:00:12] heymomimonttv: @gdodmebxu good point
[1:00:36] gdodmebxu: i don't really ever see mindflay insanity outside of demo splay
[1:00:36] crawnpocktail: @chancywilson i  just play like theyll never press a defensive
[1:00:45] StromicusRex: supa understands the concept of quiet movement
[1:00:52] Wargamingxs: Bot Supa

[2:25:19] ooPickleRicKoo: @NightMunchies true
[2:25:20] jondoe2239: he usually mains mage, thats like saying mes doesnt even play DK when he was playing warr for a season
[2:25:23] NightMunchies: Period!
[2:25:23] attomicpoon: Jahmilli is best mage just ask him
[2:25:29] 3mirrors: are you familiar with "vibes"? its the best metric we have for a ton of different subjects
[2:25:35] zachgamegodx: were using the longest time in shuffle q as the metric
[2:25:40] soddi: of my last 8 shuffles, 4 opposing healers ragequitted :/
[2:25:53] drfeltgood: Just opened 6 Conq chests on my sub rogue... literally zero sub gear attained.
[2:26:00] zachgamegodx: ladies and gents
[2:26:02] Skulligan79: I am the best mage... and I haven't even created one yet.  Think about that.
[2:26:09] ooPickleRicKoo: @soddi you don't lose mmr when you quit.. so, it makes sense
[2:26:10] NightMunchies: omg tough break
[2:26:23] ramenxo: been in shuffle q for over an hour as survival hunter guess they are trying to find 2 dhs to put me in a lobby with to make sure I dont get my 2400
[2:26:25] zachgamegodx: 9/20 for the daily sub goal lets blast that open before this lobby is over
[2:26:35] soddi: @ooPickleRicKoo oh
[2:27:03] ooPickleRicKoo: @soddi yup thats why thy are quitting.. you can get the ratings back fast
[2:27:03] NightMunchies: 6 chests not 1 good thing? So luck  maybe next drop bud
[2:27:26] drfeltgood: @NightMunchies  rukiHmm
[2:27:28] invincibledalyeth: @ramenxo don’t feel bad h hit 2300 and dropped back to 2k lol I’ve been stuck in the 2100 bracket for a bit now
[2:27:37] soddi: @ooPickleRicKoo well, not if you only get 10 rating per shuffle because the enemy left Kappa
[2:27:37] ramenxo: id love to just get a q pop
[2:27:49] chaps_86: Better question, who is better at their "main" spec than anyone else? i.e. bicmex as survival > raiku on mage
[2:27:56] zachgamegodx: play a low represented spec you’ll get a pop
[2:28:05] ooPickleRicKoo: @soddi for healers it makes sense fast queues
[2:28:09] NightMunchies: i hate that u no gear Empty hands
[2:28:09] ramenxo: p sure survival is about as low rep as it gets
[2:28:22] Morodox: seems like a very convoluted question @chaps_86
[2:28:24] zachgamegodx: but it’s a hunter, there’s rules in the algy
[2:28:33] xDroozyy: good song
[2:28:33] chaps_86: @Morodox very true
[2:28:43] zachgamegodx: it doesn’t like heavy spec stack then class stack is considered
[2:28:56] Sheepyou: ven i need this playlist
[2:29:12] NightMunchies: gonna start pickin up for  this seasons rating
[2:29:27] NightMunchies: might do good

[2:32:14] Jayzyzz_: could be about 5% louder
[2:32:16] cadillacseville: the music is too canadian
[2:32:16] StromicusRex: it might just be work comp vs home comp

[2:34:23] NightMunchies: u win sum u lose sum
[2:34:27] Jayzyzz_: @StromicusRex i have a pretty nice speaker setup too but it's still pretty soft compared to with headphones cause I always have speaker volume at like 30% otherwise the arena sounds are just way too loud
[2:34:34] ramenxo: i didnt win or lose i won 1 and lost 1 and then druid left in lobby
[2:34:40] NightMunchies: wait 2 hours id quit to
[2:35:00] StromicusRex: yeah, that's my problem. ven is perfect volume, turning him up makes him too loud, but the music is like a soft whisper @Jayzyzz_

[2:38:57] heymomimonttv: @FreddoB if you a play a hybrid class and it gets to the point where you need to heal teammates, you've already lost. ww heals are super weak anyways
[2:39:14] heymomimonttv: @shikari01 the player's parents tbh
[2:39:15] Sheepyou: anyone know where to watch dbz ?
[2:39:15] NightMunchies: healing people on a Drae dk gift of guru  only race that can selfheal and others

[2:43:54] heymomimonttv: @lordelenath thats exactly the conclusion me and my healer came to when we were figuring out what i could do better. i can get 500k+ leech healing in arenas now
[2:43:57] Dabufy: broooo this weapons

[3:17:51] ellisrainy: lots of ppl can't grasp the concept that part of the reason it's so expensive is because it's a desirable place to live lol
[3:17:52] Hizuru1: @ralotheret there are youtube vidoes about it KEKW
[3:17:55] Aroty: Liking the state and liking "the state" are two very different things

[3:26:11] ghostware9000: timeout'ing someone for saying they dont like the president. that is literally anti- free speech @heymomimonttv
[3:26:11] Wombatt_ZGZ: The population is generally moderate, but the parties cater to the lunatic fringe, which is how we get Trump in the first place
[3:26:13] heymomimonttv: freedom of speech also doesn]'t mean you can speak on private platforms about topics that people have turned off

[3:26:49] Aroty: @stromicusrex that's not entirely true. If saying my opinion puts me in a gulag, is it free speech?
[3:26:59] heymomimonttv: @ghostware9000 he didn't say he didnt like the president, he said he blames the president and then didn't back it up. that's a statement designed to rile people up.

[4:25:22] zachgamegodx: it wasnt a hook it was a step
[4:25:29] Reiumi_: crazy
[4:25:39] ThePdfreak: he did it twice aswell
[4:25:45] zachgamegodx: it shows shadowstep going on cd
[4:25:45] nameyourform: step kick?
[4:25:49] legiontheworgen: wait that was step kick + hook at the same time what the heck
[4:25:55] ryanblue98: i mean it was half way through the long cast
[4:25:56] waelrick: sus
[4:25:59] bigcityrat: Scripts are getting better and better it seems
[4:26:07] StromicusRex: has the botting issue ever been this bad before?
[4:26:11] heymomimonttv: 3 globals in 1 second? man has a happy gf at home thats for damn sure with fingers like that
[4:26:37] StromicusRex: i feel like i remember kickbotting being bad in wod was it?
[4:26:47] nikthevoker: that rogue has 4 ele shaman on his account.hmmmmmm LUL
[4:26:48] Kymagez: yes
[4:26:56] FateIRL: isnt step and kick off gcd
[4:26:58] wowsuomi: @StromicusRex Mop bg honor farmers
[4:26:59] Sheepyou: im just wondering if u could ask CHATGPT to make u a kick bot for WoW LUL
[4:27:05] thendj: call me crazy but was he not just expecting you to cast as soon as strang falls?
[4:27:11] Kymagez: wod everyone was using the honorbuddy bot
[4:27:22] Reiumi_: omg I remember that
[4:27:24] zachgamegodx: sod players in here think step kick in teh middle of a searing glare is botting
[4:27:25] tinkbelledhtv: U can set a timer in clock
[4:27:30] tinkbelledhtv: When u wanna kick
[4:27:31] Bigmoran: https://clips.twitch.tv/DignifiedHedonisticMarrowNerfBlueBlaster-WXDKVlCZbat8qfTG  The speed of the kick isn't sus but the hook back is omega sus because its a targetted ground spell
[4:27:50] thendj: ahhhh
[4:27:52] thendj: yea thats not real
[4:27:58] FateIRL: hes pikaboo jr
[4:28:03] zachgamegodx: its very easy to do that
[4:28:06] zachgamegodx: im not even trolling
[4:28:07] legiontheworgen: even with an @ cursor macro there's no way you'd get it that precise
[4:28:08] Kujo_XX: I swear I'm seeing so many bots the last few days
[4:28:15] ALLtheEXP: "very ez"
[4:28:22] Kujo_XX: Even in Blitz
[4:28:24] kazz_ret: i can do that EZ
[4:28:25] IIyena: 2 seasons played on new acc and glad and elite. seems sus lol
[4:28:27] zachgamegodx: u put ur cursor there before the step kick
[4:28:28] heymomimonttv: he's living up to his game god name for sure
[4:28:30] Telarius1: its sus especially since they're on an alt acc wit 3k achive points and are stuck 2k on like 10 toons
[4:28:39] Telarius1: not a 2k play, but who knows maybe theyre just playing out of their mind
[4:28:40] ferahgok: Can you macro hook @cursor into shadow step kick? I'll test. Could be only explanation outside of sus stuff
[4:28:49] Bigmoran: shadowstep moves your camera @zachgamegodx i dont think it works like that
[4:29:02] Nerfmetodeath: i wonder if he's hooking before the shadow step, and it jsut takes him back
[4:29:13] FateIRL: maybe he was using a step kick grapple castsequence macro
[4:29:17] Nerfmetodeath: i just tried and u can pre hook  a shadow step just doesn't seem realistic
[4:29:18] wackpoetic: Simpler explanation: He's fucking Spiderman
[4:29:19] ALLtheEXP: maybe he plays mega zoomed out and plays top down so he can still have his mouse pointed back there
[4:29:27] wackpoetic: he just did it again with Kidney it's giga sus
[4:29:30] Reiumi_: I like the spiderman theory
[4:29:40] wackpoetic: again
[4:29:41] ThePdfreak: it looks pretty cool
[4:29:42] ALLtheEXP: lol
[4:29:43] Bigmoran: ROFL
[4:29:44] ALLtheEXP: look at him go
[4:29:45] Reiumi_: lets go spiderman
[4:29:52] ThePdfreak: if you can do it legit it would be insane
[4:30:05] jazzypringle: damn everytime  is step kidney insta grapple
[4:30:13] WardenDOTA: this guys name sounds familiar i think pika said he was suss
[4:30:41] spacemanwx: HAHAHA
[4:30:46] Sheepyou: dont worry i closed my eyes
[4:30:48] clicket: not embarrassed confirmed
[4:30:54] clicket: EZ Clap
[4:31:00] wackpoetic: he did it 2 - 3 times that round as well
[4:31:03] FateIRL: nope
[4:31:05] wackpoetic: step kidney grapple instantly
[4:31:05] FateIRL: diff
[4:31:08] ferahgok: @venruki I just made a macro that can replicate what he just did btw
[4:31:19] nikthevoker: always sus when they have 4 ele shams LUL
[4:31:19] Bigmoran: The guy pikaboo thought was sus is a Rogue named Sosenka on Stormrage
[4:31:22] ALLtheEXP: share it Fera
[4:31:25] kazz_ret: give bliz a few months too investigate
[4:31:28] Telarius1: outlaw is 1 of most botted specs
[4:31:31] Telarius1: btw
[4:31:31] ryanblue98: I mean he kicked a full rep cast half way through
[4:31:36] ferahgok: #showtooltip Kick /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook
[4:31:38] nickc2122: the tunes
[4:31:43] Bigmoran: @Telarius1 confirmed?
[4:31:46] WardenDOTA: there was more than 1 guy it was a couple months ago pika fought this guy in 2s i think
[4:31:52] ferahgok: just make sure cursor is where you want to hook to as you press it
[4:32:00] Reiumi_: pepoG
[4:32:31] ryanblue98: I like when they kyte into the other spwan across the map
[4:32:35] zachgamegodx: @Bigmoran my bad i looked at the clip you're right
[4:32:39] zachgamegodx: that's cheating for sure
[4:32:42] heymomimonttv: @ferahgok i like macros, but making a macro to do something you're not humanly able to do isn't right i dont htink
[4:32:49] FateIRL: look at his armory fresh dragonflight acct has s2 glad prob a botter
[4:33:01] wackpoetic: Rewatch round 5
[4:33:06] ALLtheEXP: I just sent your macro to my main team rogue loll
[4:33:08] Nerfmetodeath: so i just made a macro that does /cast [@player] grappling hook /cast [@focus] shadow step
[4:33:12] ryanblue98: the rogue didnt even gain rating
[4:33:14] wackpoetic: he did it 2 times in the beginning of the match
[4:33:14] Nerfmetodeath: it insta took me back to my location
[4:33:17] Nerfmetodeath: idk if u have time to kick tho
[4:33:18] ThePdfreak: @heymomimonttv what about macros that use like 5 offensive cds in 1
[4:33:27] Telarius1: did u report him just incase?
[4:33:40] heymomimonttv: @ThePdfreak idk, if you wanna blow all your cds at once then thats not on you. thats not quite game breaking
[4:33:42] FateIRL: hes cheating its a fresh acct
[4:33:55] IIyena: lmfao
[4:33:57] Badasti: i just tuned in, what are we watching?
[4:33:58] StromicusRex: wtf
[4:34:00] wackpoetic: watch round 5
[4:34:10] Reiumi_: KEKW
[4:34:10] zachgamegodx: i looked at his alts and i saw his DH was the same one i saw in a clip recently where he's in brh running into a wall until people come out otherwise staying afk
[4:34:10] Telarius1: ya
[4:34:11] ALLtheEXP: lmao
[4:34:13] zachgamegodx: definitely bottign
[4:34:13] Telarius1: thats prob a bot
[4:34:15] SwiisH_Tv: His check-pvp says he just started playing S2 DF
[4:34:15] pr1me1989: BOT BRO
[4:34:15] ferahgok: Ha, like i said my macro does that
[4:34:16] Badasti: oh that rogue
[4:34:17] spacemanwx: suspicious as fuck
[4:34:17] ThePdfreak: it just uses a bunch of abilities at the same time its the same thing @heymomimonttv
[4:34:19] TacobellWOW: this game is so cringe now
[4:34:19] IIyena: def botting
[4:34:20] nickc2122: sus
[4:34:21] Telarius1: He's prob toggling a bot lol
[4:34:23] jxygodx: sus
[4:34:24] liquidburst: no way u do that with a macro
[4:34:26] FateIRL: look him up
[4:34:28] Nerfmetodeath: I wish u had hook tracked because he might be hooking first
[4:34:32] dmgcurry: interesting
[4:34:32] McLarge: Probably a bot, but is that Grapple? That might be another button he pressed there
[4:34:33] WardenDOTA: well someone says he has a macro that does it
[4:34:35] ferahgok: @liquidburst You can
[4:34:37] ferahgok: I just made it
[4:34:37] wackpoetic: It's the power of one for all
[4:34:39] Telarius1: u cannot @-target with grapple
[4:34:42] Telarius1: so u cannot macro that
[4:34:43] McLarge: They have a damage dealing ability that charges them to their target?
[4:34:43] heymomimonttv: @ThePdfreak someone blowing all their offensive cds isnt the same as someone using a macro to control a healer at range
[4:34:46] Palumor: SUS
[4:34:49] wackpoetic: watch the beginning of round 5
[4:34:49] Sheepyou: check the macro on ur rogue @venruki
[4:34:52] heymomimonttv: palumor has spoken
[4:34:53] FateIRL: this is the most amount of cheaters ive ever seen, wtf they dont ban
[4:34:53] nickc2122: nah thats sys
[4:34:55] nickc2122: sus
[4:34:56] SwiisH_Tv: But also on check-pvp he has a ton of toons over 2100 since S2 DF
[4:34:57] wackpoetic: he does it twice to kidney you
[4:34:57] Hobblefoot: Oh shit! Pika played a rogue awhile back that did something crazy like that and was convinced it was a bot.
[4:35:11] liquidburst: @ferahgok thats way to fast for a macro
[4:35:12] Telarius1: 2k exp player btw
[4:35:16] FateIRL: show in real time
[4:35:18] FateIRL: stop freezing it
[4:35:19] Telarius1: on alt acc lol
[4:35:22] ryanblue98: @Telarius1 thought he had glad?
[4:35:24] krisdahaka: lol
[4:35:25] Badasti: this rogue is a fucking dragonball z character
[4:35:25] McLarge: You can see the chain, that is confirmed to be grapple
[4:35:27] Palumor: ive never seen that in my life
[4:35:30] irelqueen_1: thats exactly why i left the game im too old for that shiet
[4:35:31] zachgamegodx: its cheating
[4:35:35] ATHLTE: maybe its trills ghost account rogue
[4:35:37] ATHLTE: lmaoo
[4:35:37] ferahgok: @liquidburst I can link it again if yall want. it's possible
[4:35:38] krisdahaka: can you do it in slow motion?
[4:35:39] Palumor: Even with an @cursor hook that is sketchy LOL
[4:35:48] ThePdfreak: someone wrote a macro for it though maybe it works
[4:35:49] wackpoetic: i swear watch round 5 after you pointed it out i saw him do it twice in a row with kidney
[4:35:49] Badasti: did he grapple or get lifeggripped?
[4:35:50] IIyena: looks like a bot lmfao
[4:35:53] pridez49: that is insane rofl
[4:35:53] WardenDOTA: sounds like people just need to get the new macro
[4:35:54] Hizuru1: he jus that good dude
[4:35:54] Reiumi_: he's just built different
[4:35:54] dmgcurry: yea safe to just report
[4:35:54] FateIRL: hes a ferrario
[4:35:57] waelrick: LUL
[4:35:57] FateIRL: ferrari
[4:35:57] ALLtheEXP: Test IT @Palumor  #showtooltip Kick /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook
[4:35:57] ATHLTE: ye hella sketchy
[4:35:58] krisdahaka: hahahaha
[4:35:58] ryanblue98: he has a racing gamming chair i bet
[4:35:59] krisdahaka: that's omegasus
[4:36:04] Kujo_XX: @ferahgok I don't think the macro itself is in question, it's who/what is executing it
[4:36:05] Hobblefoot: That was the most amazing thing ever. It was like he was playing at 2x speed.
[4:36:07] Badasti: maybe the priest lifegripped him as he stepped?
[4:36:08] Hizuru1: Chat defending wizk now attacking random good guy
[4:36:09] dmgcurry: that movement didnt even seem human
[4:36:10] Hizuru1: You are bunch of clowns
[4:36:16] ultra_content: @venruki  thaat looks a speed hack only on grapple
[4:36:16] spacemanwx: Just report him lol
[4:36:17] WardenDOTA: if palumor had this macro he wouldnt have let the miestro down
[4:36:21] yuiop_rob: thats reckful lowkey
[4:36:21] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:36:21] Sheepyou: @venruki test the macro on ur Rogue what @ALLtheEXP said
[4:36:24] Reiumi_: HUH
[4:36:27] vald1122: That's some crazy macro..too fast
[4:36:29] liquidburst: @ferahgok clip it that u kicked some1 and are already midair in the same global
[4:36:30] Bigmoran: people saying you can do it with a  cursor macro are missing the point since shadowstep literally moves your camera, so your cursor would change
[4:36:35] Hizuru1: Facts truth hurts
[4:36:39] Kenotonic: the only possible scenario thats possible is the outlaw gap closer pressed instantly but that was hook you can see it
[4:36:39] Badasti: or no grip would have shown wings right
[4:36:42] ALLtheEXP: @Hizuru1 lolge
[4:36:43] ultra_content: speed hack
[4:36:51] TacobellWOW: @hizuru1 wrekt
[4:36:54] ooPickleRicKoo: @Hizuru1 bro this guy again.. just ban this dude
[4:36:55] ATHLTE: doubles down on it too sheeeeesh
[4:36:56] ThePdfreak: @Bigmoran try the macro people are spamming and tell us what happened
[4:36:58] FateIRL: hes 100% botting first season playing is df s2 glad
[4:37:01] WardenDOTA: @bigmoran the point is you press the macro with your cursor nnext to you i assume, so the macro step kicks far away and then grapples back to next to where you were
[4:37:01] FateIRL: fresh account
[4:37:02] ferahgok: @liquidburst I'm not quite sure how to clip and record but i'm testing it live in valdrakken atm
[4:37:03] wackpoetic: Ladies and Gentlemen, we're here at today's Mental Gymnastics competition and early favorite Hizuru1 is off to a tremendous head start!
[4:37:12] heymomimonttv: @wackpoetic LMAOOOOOOO
[4:37:14] zachgamegodx: ive seen the lad cheat before on the alts listed on his acct so i know already 100% cheating
[4:37:20] wowsuomi: Still waiting to hear if same rogue as the one pika vsed
[4:37:21] heymomimonttv: tears in my eyes @wackpoetic
[4:37:37] Telarius1: hes on his like 15th botted char making alt accs
[4:37:46] Telarius1: getting to 3k achive points then he gets banned lol
[4:37:48] TacobellWOW: he also immune kidneyed you that lobby which makes it even more sus
[4:37:51] Telarius1: makes a new acc
[4:37:52] liquidburst: @ferahgok even a pro awc rogue thinks a sus and doesnt do it?
[4:37:54] Sheepyou: @venruki test macro with ur rogue and repair gear
[4:37:59] Hobblefoot: @Hizuru1 No one is using facts here. It is all subjective and people are simply analyzing an abnormally quick movement.  On either side of the debate.
[4:38:06] spacemanwx: ISnutz
[4:38:08] WardenDOTA: @TacobellWOW how's that suss lol any decent bot would track DRs
[4:38:12] FreddoB: where's the enjoyment in that?
[4:38:14] dryangore: thought conditional macros were removed but do macros that allow you to spam sap (for instance) but hold the global for you unless they trinket to insta resap the trinket still exist?
[4:38:14] jxygodx: fresh account, multiple ele alts that are 3k in shuff, definitely a bot abuser
[4:38:19] Telarius1: ^^^
[4:38:20] Palumor: Maybe hes the new Kalvish and hes drinking his first energy drink making big plays
[4:38:24] Palumor: Im too old for that
[4:38:30] Hobblefoot: @Palumor Truth!
[4:38:32] Celestiahz: GG ven, that lobby was heavy priest favored.  Game before that I went 0-6 to double ele dh and joxi rsham lol
[4:38:36] Schwenkyytv: that macro does work
[4:38:43] ryanblue98: hes the next better pika
[4:38:45] jxygodx: fresh account, multiple ele alts that are 3k in shuff, definitely a bot abuser 100%
[4:38:47] heymomimonttv: @jxygodx yea thats damning
[4:38:48] WardenDOTA: yea hes just drinking prime
[4:38:53] Hizuru1: yee and in 10 years no noe killed totam like that but keep on LEL
[4:38:57] Badasti: @Palumor you just need the same flavour gfuel
[4:38:58] FateIRL: nobody starts playing wow in df s2 gets glad and has 20 alts
[4:38:59] McLarge: @Palumor The new Kalvish LUL
[4:39:05] ryanblue98: adderal just going to leave that here
[4:39:08] FateIRL: its sketchy
[4:39:15] thendj: tbh its kind of like league where average players can have flashy mechs, but they have terrible game knowledge/decision making
[4:39:16] ferahgok: @liquidburst Sure I'm not saying whether or not the rogue is cheating, i'm just saying that movement is possible with a simple @cursor macro
[4:39:17] kand1nsky: Can they not make healer bots ffs so I can have faster lobbies
[4:39:20] SwiisH_Tv: its sad every game has cheaters anymore its wild
[4:39:22] wowsuomi: Should put that guy in the awc
[4:39:25] WardenDOTA: that ret is r1 ret pally ya
[4:39:26] Schwenkyytv: @venruki that shadowstep kick hook macro works
[4:39:30] Cocoapuffs1: imagine being so persistent to defend some random guy @Hizuru1
[4:39:33] ALLtheEXP: Chat, I think @Hizuru1 is mad
[4:39:36] FateIRL: there was never this many cheaters in bfa/SL wtf happened
[4:39:38] bdobbi: let's be real..there is a lot of sketchy stuff going on in the current meta
[4:39:42] Hobblefoot: @Hizuru1 Your argument is just as 'absolute' as the people you are countering.  Which to be fair makes for a fun debate.
[4:39:54] Neero_90: can you please change stream title to Retail Randy Stare
[4:39:55] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot yup
[4:39:58] Telarius1: ive met alot of botting outlaws in shuf
[4:40:00] Neero_90: ty
[4:40:03] Telarius1: with 600 achive points
[4:40:06] ooPickleRicKoo: @kand1nsky healers need to make a lot of judgment decisions not based on data.. I doubt you can make a bot healer
[4:40:07] Telarius1: doing that exact samething
[4:40:07] PinotGrigio90: it was just an animation bug
[4:40:09] Palumor: @venruki the thing that is sus is what Bigmoran said, when you do @cursor hook it goes from your camera angle/positon, and that changes when you step, so if its a spammable macro it wouldnt be smooth like that
[4:40:13] Palumor: Super sus fr
[4:40:14] endiscope: playing ret is RSS with hpal feels like i just get scammed by a forbearance i didn't see 20% of the time
[4:40:15] Badasti: @Hizuru1 my friend sniped a totem just like wizk did tonight, he was actually trying to click another totem and 1shot it before a single tick of spirit link...
[4:40:22] WardenDOTA: i mean we literally have people saying there's a macro that does it, can we not just test it
[4:40:32] PinotGrigio90: you guys see him grapple before he shadowstep kicked :D
[4:40:41] Cocoapuffs1: It's like when you get poly'd and camera angle gets all messed up when you try to trinket quickly
[4:40:42] Schwenkyytv: @palu the macro works , you just keep your cursor at where you wanna hook back
[4:40:51] Schwenkyytv: @Palumor
[4:40:54] ooPickleRicKoo: @ooPickleRicKoo I mean you can but wouldn't be good
[4:40:55] ferahgok: @Schwenkyytv exactly
[4:40:58] Cocoapuffs1: @Schwenkyytv the game doesnt let you
[4:41:01] clicket: @Schwenkyytv yeah but that position moves when you step lol
[4:41:03] Palumor: @schwenkyytv maybe I get on the PC and debunk this...
[4:41:03] ALLtheEXP: @Badasti is ur teammate wizk
[4:41:05] Hizuru1: + you get banned in wow for chat so having new account is nothing special nowdays.
[4:41:09] ferahgok: #showtooltip Kick /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook
[4:41:10] Schwenkyytv: @clicket i just did it 5 time :)
[4:41:13] kata_gamez: hop on your rogue and test it
[4:41:14] WardenDOTA: palumor is getting some free rogue tips from chat rn
[4:41:15] ALLtheEXP: @Palumor pleasge
[4:41:16] ALLtheEXP: Palumor: @venruki the thing that is sus is what Bigmoran said, when you do @cursor hook it goes from your camera angle/positon, and that changes when you step, so if its a spammable macro it wouldnt be smooth like that
[4:41:20] bdobbi: now we are talking
[4:41:21] twinbladeuk: EZ Content
[4:41:24] jxygodx: theres no defending it after looking him up, literal fresh account with multiple 3k shuff ele's
[4:41:27] legiontheworgen: the only way that'd work is if you kept your camera in topdown or angled for that to work O_o
[4:41:29] zachgamegodx: Ven aalso
[4:41:33] zachgamegodx: tier list update
[4:41:35] Badasti: @ALLtheEXP no lol, he was just trying to click another totem and the shaman dropped link where he clicked and it insta died
[4:41:39] Schwenkyytv: @venruki #showtooltip Kick  /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep  /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick  /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook
[4:41:43] SwiisH_Tv: lol
[4:41:52] Schwenkyytv: make sure you make a new line after "/cast"
[4:41:52] shameshady: The top five plays from cup 1, was those picked by Ziqo or was it a group thing ? @venruki
[4:41:56] waelrick: LUL
[4:41:57] ALLtheEXP: @Badasti tell him he's the new wizk and stroke his ego lol that's amazing
[4:41:58] WardenDOTA: this guy may be cheating and suss but we are beyond that now, he might have accidentally taught us some sweet rogue macro tech now we have to see if it works
[4:42:16] wowsuomi: Ven gonna show u how he did it
[4:42:22] slyphex: what if the hook comes first in the macro, because there's travel time but no  travel time on step, so you get hooked back instantly
[4:42:23] Hobblefoot: I have played Outlaw poorly since Wrath and I think that play is actually doable. BUT it would have to be part fluke when it comes to the part after the kick.  The grapple back was uncanny and placed quite insane.
[4:42:31] Schwenkyytv: @venruki new line starts with /cast
[4:42:34] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Palumor WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[4:42:55] Palumor: Palumor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! nice
[4:43:00] Hobblefoot: I have tried a grapple macro and I hated it because I never could get my cursor in the right spot. LOL
[4:43:01] Badasti: @ALLtheEXP i did, we were in voice... it was hilarious. We were playing dampener wiz cleave all night, then logged over to warrior dk to switch our brains off. I didnt even know link was droppped until he called out that he'd killed it
[4:43:13] notoriousztv: what about a target grapple macro
[4:43:14] Baconeggcheese: Ven don't do it, don't go to the rogue side
[4:43:22] notoriousztv: same way priests can feather with @player
[4:43:22] Schwenkyytv: @venruki your macro isnt right
[4:43:35] Schwenkyytv: you have to start a new line when /cast is
[4:43:55] thendj: @notoriousztv cant do that anymore
[4:43:55] Schwenkyytv: theres more than one
[4:43:56] ALLtheEXP: @Badasti That's amazing haha. My team does the same thing, we've been practicing a lot of RPS and after a long session we swap to something like DH/Dev or DH/Outlaw to just run people down
[4:44:00] Telarius1: ya cant be clumped together
[4:44:13] Palumor: Can someone report the macro
[4:44:16] Palumor: on PC now
[4:44:21] deathb0b: ^
[4:44:24] FateIRL: why report it?
[4:44:30] deathb0b: hey @Palumor
[4:44:32] deathb0b: <3
[4:44:36] Schwenkyytv: ya then ut your cursor add where you wanna grapple back to and just hit the macro

[4:44:39] Palumor: not report

[4:44:58] thendj: LMAO
[4:44:59] Reiumi_: EZ
[4:45:00] ferahgok: :)
[4:45:01] Dracwow: lmaooo
[4:45:01] Palumor: ur kick didnt go off
[4:45:04] Palumor: u need to spam it prob
[4:45:06] Telarius1: no kick tho
[4:45:18] Badasti: put it on mouse wheel keybind, best spam
[4:45:18] Schwenkyytv: spam it for kick
[4:45:25] Schwenkyytv: or kidney or whaterver
[4:45:25] scubaclay: wait what is this>
[4:45:26] ALLtheEXP: yes, they are
[4:45:27] twinbladeuk: leveling my rogue brb PepeLaugh
[4:45:28] heymomimonttv: macros like that are dumb af
[4:45:29] Ey_an: a macro like this is crazy yeah
[4:45:31] Kymagez: agreed
[4:45:36] Hobblefoot: @Palumor Change of subject. Really poorly done the way you treated that Crusader guy. He simply wanted to have a few rousing games with like minded players and you were so abusive!
[4:45:37] Axtin: are macros stupid or is outlaw just stupid
[4:45:37] heymomimonttv: macro like that is game breaking
[4:45:39] wowsuomi: Tell him to cast shomething
[4:45:50] WardenDOTA: does training dummy count as harm
[4:45:50] Telarius1: his grapple in the clip went off before his step
[4:46:10] WardenDOTA: maybe you have to face the target
[4:46:10] kata_gamez: does the target have to be casting for it to kick?
[4:46:11] Jeff8711: is it cuz the dummy isn't casting?
[4:46:12] imKrox_: i dont think target dummies can be kicked, can they?
[4:46:19] WardenDOTA: the macro doens't check for casting lol
[4:46:21] Cocoapuffs1: yes you can kick them
[4:46:22] Hark0n: cuz its casting the hook at the same time as the kick ur prob out of range
[4:46:23] Cocoapuffs1: lol
[4:46:25] Badasti: maybe try put it on scroll wheel as the keybind, thats the quickest way to spam
[4:46:26] deathb0b: u can kick the air
[4:46:31] VetisBR: i kick dummies in arena all the time
[4:46:33] WardenDOTA: use it a bit farther from your position
[4:46:33] Schwenkyytv: idk mine is working
[4:46:34] deathb0b: u dont need a target
[4:46:37] smergeI: ur spamming the macro right?
[4:46:39] Schwenkyytv: mu kick goes on d
[4:46:40] Schwenkyytv: cd
[4:46:41] FreddoB: So it's pretty much a ranged kick
[4:46:42] smergeI: i know its a dumb question
[4:46:45] JmanOwnz: do you get caught on a global for being too close?
[4:46:46] Hobblefoot: I often kick air.  I am the king of granting Precog in games.
[4:46:52] Palumor: Jesus man
[4:46:52] Reiumi_: Pog
[4:46:56] scubaclay: can you share it?
[4:46:57] deathb0b: it just needs to be in range
[4:46:57] Hizuru1: dam guess not cheater anymore
[4:46:58] ATHLTE: nerf outlaw

[4:47:04] Badasti: thats so stupid XD
[4:47:04] Hark0n: THE MACRO GODS
[4:47:09] thendj: CANT WAIT FOR AWC
[4:47:12] heymomimonttv: that should be a shitty macro just like the kick macro from last season
[4:47:14] Reiumi_: we'll keep is safe...shhhh :)
[4:47:14] ALLtheEXP: NOW SEND GAMES ON TOES AND DICK
[4:47:15] hilariousharald: that’s so dump
[4:47:17] WardenDOTA: can we get some warlock bots to teach me OP macros please
[4:47:17] baxter5569: rogues are "fine" btw
[4:47:19] imKrox_: Incoming ban of macros? Kappa
[4:47:20] heymomimonttv: disqualifiable macro
[4:47:23] faizwolf: ciao
[4:47:25] bloodgut96: what does it do?
[4:47:25] Reiumi_: new macro dropped boys
[4:47:35] Hizuru1: they will cause devs are stupid
[4:47:38] clicket: download the r1 weakaura POGGIES
[4:47:38] ferahgok: Apologies for making outlaw even more broken lmao
[4:47:39] Ronsimus: its about fcking time they remove addons from arena
[4:47:40] Venallafat: welp time to play some outlaw
[4:47:41] Telarius1: removes mechanical skill required
[4:47:42] poroyou: working on automate game for me WA
[4:47:42] Hizuru1: have 0 spine to block cheats like this
[4:47:43] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Jrockill WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[4:47:53] kazz_ret: damn
[4:47:58] Badasti: dude Ven, have you seen the latest skillcapped video? they give a macro to show when your healer is cc'd. It's so stupid
[4:47:59] Palumor: free youtube content.. rukiGrin
[4:48:13] Palumor: LOL
[4:48:13] Badasti: you dont even need to look at arena frames anymore
[4:48:14] ThePdfreak: you can do it with any ability aswell
[4:48:16] hilariousharald: how are casual players supposed to have fun while shit like this exists
[4:48:19] zachgamegodx: he was
[4:48:26] Hobblefoot: Are all of you guys using shit like this?  Is this why I sit at 1800 and all of you are 2400 and up.  I don't use any of that crazy stuff.  Hell I hardly notice the addons I have and don't even really know how to set up macros!
[4:48:27] poroyou: you're not suppose to have fun
[4:48:32] Denohar: "venruki hates rogues" posts incoming
[4:48:33] Badasti: not a macro, a weakaura... my brain
[4:48:34] Hobblefoot: You are all cheaters compared to my dumb ass
[4:48:35] b_lappy: @badasti that weak aura has been out for the entirety of dragonflight
[4:48:40] WardenDOTA: new account r1 ele shuff = instant ban please
[4:48:41] sbrees: No wonder pvp is dying in this game
[4:48:50] Schwenkyytv: you prob have to have like sperate binds for normal focus kick with and without hook
[4:48:57] heymomimonttv: we cant hear supa
[4:48:59] Badasti: @b_lappy i dint know about it... its the dumbest shit ive ever seen
[4:48:59] heymomimonttv: music too loud
[4:49:01] Hobblefoot: @sbrees You may be on to something.
[4:49:10] zachgamegodx: https://check-pvp.fr/us/Tichondrius/Xen%C3%BC i saw this DH running into the middle gate on blackrock and he wouldnt leave the room until someone came in his line of sight, we avoided his los and his priest gripped him out of the room, and he immediately started doing 10 mill dps
[4:49:16] zachgamegodx: same acct as the rogue
[4:49:17] Sendran96: What's the best way to climb as a new player? Can barely get into a 3s group with fresh CR
[4:49:27] bruce_t_wayne: i like makros that use 2 abilities off of gcd simultaneously tho
[4:49:40] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot yes same with cheating wall hacking addons
[4:49:42] WardenDOTA: @Sendran96 play some solo to learn the game, get good rating, then you can find group with solo shuf exp
[4:49:52] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot main reason why pvp sucks and gets scripted
[4:49:56] ALLtheEXP: @zachgamegodx Damn, that dude is a GAMER looka t all his high rated toons
[4:50:01] Hobblefoot: @Hizuru1 I don't even know what that is.
[4:50:07] Sendran96: @WardenDOTA 1833 solo currently. What should I aim for?
[4:50:08] bigdam2024: destro fire
[4:50:14] bigdam2024: for the meme
[4:50:24] Reiumi_: KEKW
[4:50:28] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot playing game whle watching diminishgin returns trackers, cooldown tackers and running around this.
[4:50:32] Badasti: roxxy supposed to be playing dh to pair with ww
[4:50:34] grimmjowhd: ww/uh dk isnt good?
[4:50:44] heymomimonttv: uh dk kinda gimped rn
[4:50:45] flyingorangee: mage Pog
[4:50:52] baxter5569: whats easier to learn, hpal or either priest spec. i need a break from rsham
[4:50:53] Palumor: @venruki I'm down to hoolibang some people with Venfuki some time
[4:50:58] Palumor: we need a goated hpriest though\
[4:50:59] WardenDOTA: that should be good enough but idk 3s is completely dead right now, it's gonna be really hard to find a group
[4:51:28] Badasti: mage lock, the dampening
[4:51:29] Muskybiggie: @venruki how come nobody plays mage/lock in AWC?
[4:52:01] Sendran96: @WardenDOTA Gotcha. So basically just no one plays haha
[4:52:27] Hobblefoot: @Hizuru1 Oh! Yeah I tried to use OmniBar but it kept giving me error messages so I gave up.  90% of my game is watching the movements of players on the screen and reacting to familiar spell effects.  I did try that GladiatorLOSA where someone tells you stuff but it was worse and I could not concentrate because so much happens at once. So I got rid of that too.
[4:52:35] SwiisH_Tv: Supa always sounds like hes in a bad mood lol
[4:52:39] WardenDOTA: you can make your own group and just say "fresh cr 1800 solo exp lf chill games" or something but expect to sit around a while if you aren't a healer
[4:52:40] guesswhofoo: supashear
[4:52:47] smergeI: whats the hooligans comp?
[4:52:59] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot smart
[4:53:07] chizzad52: ww sub hpriest
[4:53:07] lilknarcyon: The hoolibang comp is hpriest+sub+ww
[4:53:42] Hark0n: ultrazug inc
[4:54:04] Badasti: people that reflect glacial are toxic, esp if its followed with a ray
[4:54:14] ALLtheEXP: CLIP IT
[4:54:19] Badasti: should be reportable tbh
[4:54:33] ryanblue98: all 3 afk sus
[4:54:47] ALLtheEXP: LOOOOL
[4:54:50] slyphex: LUL
[4:54:51] Badasti: this was an awful idea XD
[4:54:52] IIyena: lmfao
[4:55:01] poroyou: imagine that worked lmao
[4:55:02] guesswhofoo: being a name makes this 1000% funnier
[4:55:03] Badasti: the mistake was thinking DH's can die
[4:55:11] guesswhofoo: bros running for his life screaming HEEELPP
[4:55:17] IIyena: grounding stopped it lol
[4:55:19] guesswhofoo: BEING A GNOME *
[4:55:57] Hark0n: big dam - DH doubling every1s dps
[4:56:05] MartianPig: MartianPig subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[4:56:18] Hobblefoot: @Hizuru1 That is not what they call me in lobbies!  LOL
[4:58:39] SwiisH_Tv: lol doesnt matter dhs dont die
[4:59:15] heymomimonttv: the irony of being named 'pvpnofun' while running double dh kekw
[4:59:20] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot xD
[4:59:22] Sheepyou: imagine Healers with Energy/Focus instead of Mana , would this work ?
[4:59:35] slyphex: @heymomimonttv it's not just his name, it's a promise
[4:59:36] ramenxo: actual state of the game right here what a fucking shitshow
[4:59:37] RedeemedbyJesus: lol the game has devolved into this
[4:59:42] Hizuru1: @Sheepyou would make he alers more fun
[4:59:54] Hizuru1: @Sheepyou like Overwatch healers are Pog
[4:59:54] ATHLTE: how many dispels did the dhs do
[4:59:59] Badasti: sums up my entire night of arena today
[4:59:59] ramenxo: that made me leave my solo shuffle q and log off
[5:00:02] SwiisH_Tv: its super sick
[5:00:02] sourbutts: actually easier to kill a healer than a DH
[5:00:08] bruce_t_wayne: dh is so stupid
[5:00:08] Ultramagnus85: they were just eating rays of frost
[5:00:11] Badasti: dh after dh just doing wtf he likes and nobody can do anything about it
[5:00:25] zachgamegodx: but they die ins tuns
[5:00:29] Sheepyou: @venruki what do you say .. if they made Healers with Energy/Focus instead of mana ?
[5:00:30] dakila24: honestly after watching that game, i don't feel so bad about going 1-5 in a 3dh lobby
[5:00:34] Hobblefoot: Couldn't you have won if you played double Sub?  I mean don't be so dramatic.
[5:00:38] SwiisH_Tv: the funny part is the only class that destroyed dhs were sub rogues
[5:00:40] stealthwalker99: I would still take fighting a dh over a ww any day
[5:00:47] heymomimonttv: most comps with twin dps don't work. dh is so broken that you can run 2 dh and be even more of a nuisance
[5:00:49] Nickystr1x: call an ambulance....but not the for the dhs
[5:01:04] FreddoB: that wall was epic
[5:01:24] ramenxo: i do not understand how blizzard hasnt addressed dh in almost 2 months of them being half of ladder
[5:01:25] chaps_86: Have a good resto of your stream Ven, leavin work
[5:01:40] SwiisH_Tv: Why not run Arcane?
[5:01:49] StromicusRex: i'm also leaving work! bye
[5:01:51] heymomimonttv: off to fulfill my vday duties, see ya tomorrow ven + chat
[5:02:17] FreddoB: I'm gonna sleep soon

[5:02:33] bruce_t_wayne: bye lads and ladies
[5:02:57] Badasti: valentines nothing, I'm so sick and I can't even fall asleep NotLikeThis
[5:03:14] Badasti: no mercy

[5:03:19] Badasti: he deserves it for playing melee
[5:03:20] FreddoB: @Badasti sux!
[5:03:41] sourbutts: i always thought this comp was better with hpala/rdudu
[5:03:41] dakila24: EZ
[5:05:08] boolshow: always op mage lock
[5:08:05] Sheepyou: just bought conquest boxes for my alt 6 boxes and 4 wrists and 2 rings .. fuck me what a waste
[5:08:06] Moobot: Latest video "I 1v1'd Pikaboo In Arena As A Healer" view it here: youtu.be/GVBOfGril9w
[5:09:57] ramenxo: his veng retreat got bugged out bc of the static field totem so he was just divine shield for 5 seconds during that whole ray lmao
[5:10:05] sourbutts: mage freecasting most thte game and its bottom damage, its time mage got a buff
[5:10:46] Sheepyou: @sourbutts if u let a Destru WL do this ur whole team is dead in seconds .. lol
[5:11:20] ramenxo: Divine blur up
[5:11:33] waelrick: LUL

[5:11:48] kyaii: haha mage lock looks so weak
[5:11:48] Ultramagnus85: dh just takes no dmg some reason
[5:11:57] zombieDolfin: Are we still using Glacial Spike on Frost? I just resubbed and my build seems out of date LUL
[5:12:06] FreddoB: All that kiting?
[5:12:09] Ultramagnus85: less than 50% hp ray of frost walks away
[5:12:15] ellisrainy: check discy when u get a free min brotha <3 not urgent tho no rush
[5:12:21] ellisrainy: just yapping
[5:12:23] ramenxo: whats stronger
[5:12:35] ramenxo: the full power of a train frost mage with maximum stacks blasting a ray of frost
[5:12:38] ramenxo: or a backflip

[5:13:27] aceofspades_80: arcane?
[5:13:29] ramenxo: you hit a max stack ray of frost into that dh and did about 20k dam total i think its time for ww
[5:13:33] sourbutts: as frost mage main forver, its sadge too frost mage be so weak
[5:13:43] sourbutts: to see*
[5:13:43] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: frost mage is soooooooo boring also two bad lobbies against them today so I’m a hater
[5:14:10] bruce_t_wayne: i also would love to see some arcane action
[5:14:44] Feracks: DOWN GOES VENRUKI
[5:15:13] Kymagez: SO YOU BROKE BLIZZCON
[5:15:14] jukeandnuke: just found my work computer has a better system then my old gaming computer - looks like I'll be playing wow during the work day soon :)
[5:15:18] Kymagez: oops caps
[5:15:45] novaspectv: go fire mage full mastery again
[5:15:47] kyaii: Honestly it feels like without ring of fire mages would just tickle poeple
[5:15:50] Schwenkyytv: i miss the old combustion
[5:15:52] sparqTTV: theres a lot of aoe on classes that ruin CC
[5:15:54] sparqTTV: :(
[5:15:58] sourbutts: frost mage damage outside of the healer being CC and doing ray of frost on target is laughable
[5:16:08] zombieDolfin: 100%, it sucks when you accidentally break CC because of that talent
[5:16:23] b_lappy: a talent for nether tempest to be single target would be great too
[5:16:27] lucaskerkoff: can you play arena crossfaction now ?
[5:16:40] seyvyur: yes
[5:16:55] lucaskerkoff: lol FR thats huge
[5:17:02] ZealotryTV: member the good ol days of double DH mana burn games?
[5:17:27] sourbutts: give frost mage deep freeze please
[5:19:15] Xeliumimar: state of game with DH makes me sad, its like the devs really dont care about pvp
[5:19:39] Hizuru1: Overwatch 2 new ranking system is Pog
[5:19:40] ZealotryTV: @Xeliumimar they never have
[5:20:04] Hizuru1: Dh name KEKW
[5:21:03] Hark0n: ZUGA ZUGA
[5:21:07] St0nedCan00k: KEKW
[5:21:07] kreyzy8: DH GIGACHAD
[5:21:08] Hizuru1: Watch Ven play 2x dh soon
[5:21:11] Hizuru1: DH GIGACHAD
[5:21:16] novaspectv: they have unlimited defense
[5:21:18] cruelhabbitts: how boring , 2 dhs
[5:21:31] Hizuru1: @cruelhabbitts play it giga fun
[5:21:33] sbrees: At least you got two nether and link, that's a win
[5:21:50] nightmxz: backflip when ww gets close -> blur -> backflip again -> meta leap -> backflip -> blur
[5:21:53] Xeliumimar: I don't blame them for playing that comp, if games dev cared, they'd tune DH
[5:21:57] nightmxz: nice try going the DH kid KEKW
[5:21:59] cruelhabbitts: @hizuru1 what’s the new ow ranking system? haven’t played in about
[5:22:02] cruelhabbitts: a bit *
[5:22:27] TheMaaanShow: in eu 80% of games dh skilled just broken class
[5:22:29] sourbutts: beyond stupid how strong dh is
[5:22:30] Kikrino: Dubble outlaw rogue would be fun also
[5:22:34] NerdEngineering: what! WW gameplay... woot
[5:22:39] ImTheLuckyWinner: missed the end, who won?
[5:22:53] Cerion17: @ImTheLuckyWinner enemy
[5:22:58] ImTheLuckyWinner: ah
[5:23:04] ImTheLuckyWinner: Ty @cerion17
[5:23:10] Hobblefoot: Yeah but DH is not half so bad as those dastardly Outlaws. They do y'all like that but faster, better and with way more damage.   ... ...
[5:23:25] TheMaaanShow: maybe devs tune them if they get a new venruki video:D
[5:23:41] furesway: Casually sipping from a 5 gallon jug. Nice.
[5:23:53] NerdEngineering: @venruki would you say this has been one of the most exciting AWCs we've had in awhile...? I'm loving the comp diversity.
[5:23:55] Badasti: by a hair
[5:23:56] ATHLTE: ven did you do the tier list?
[5:24:00] Hark0n: ofc you lost there's no 1v1ing a rogue lol
[5:24:13] Hobblefoot: @venruki You did not lose. It was masterful.  I mean technically you lost but literally no one could have done better under those conditions.
[5:24:13] ATHLTE: oh aight cool thought i missed it
[5:24:28] ImTheLuckyWinner: same rogue spec?
[5:24:42] Hobblefoot: @ImTheLuckyWinner Sub
[5:26:20] iamceasur: i just found out amazon is a public company, therefore twitch is public, therfore twitch MUST respect freedom of  speech LUL
[5:26:28] Volgi95: clean
[5:26:34] Cerion17: @iamceasur 5Head
[5:27:11] ramenxo: just reroll dh and press blur easiest solution
[5:27:41] crawnpocktail: dev evoker is my vote
[5:27:47] crawnpocktail: 0 IQ proof
[5:27:48] Cerion17: I'm doing so poorly in 3s but in soloque im pretty decent, i don't get it q_q
[5:27:54] Kymagez: bs i die in stuns a lot
[5:27:55] flyingorangee: Madge they need to nerf them a little bit
[5:28:02] flames222: i prefer outlaw, actually feels like you are playing the game instead of a world of tanks ipad spec lol
[5:28:17] ramenxo: i lost my mmr train on hunter going 1-5 in a double dh lobby so now im getting 5-20 rating a game
[5:28:22] ramenxo: lame as fuck
[5:28:38] Hobblefoot: I like Survival Hunter over both. I will take fun. And that shit is fun.
[5:28:40] blueblrrrd: does dinoe ever stream? im always trying to find vods
[5:28:47] kata_gamez: play the green lizard
[5:28:50] flyingorangee: mage Prayge
[5:29:06] crawnpocktail: ele most fun spec, devastation easiest
[5:29:20] notoriousztv: same, literaly 2 dhs per shuff
[5:29:41] baxter5569: @ramenxo try going 4-2 5-1 3-3 for 2 hours then run into 3 blenderballs with fistweaver and lose all that rating gain + and extra 100 rating because you got 0-6 cuz there is nothign to stop them just blendering on top of you
[5:30:22] ramenxo: im just trying to get 2400 on survival hunter and i think bc my mmr got fried by 2 bad lobbies itll be faster to q my alt
[5:30:45] ramenxo: u get a lucky 5-1 or 6-0 at 1600 you just blast up to 2100 instantly, happened to my rogue
[5:30:55] baxter5569: lol i feel that :) i do it on my evokers. when my main stalls out i run low queues on my alt till the bad queues go away
[5:31:38] ALLtheEXP: I spent the last week gearing my SP and finally wanted to step into the shuffle last night and immediately went 0-6 into 1-5 LOL
[5:31:57] baxter5569: just so stupid lobby dependent 2100+. anything with a warrior and i can go 4-2 or 5-1 on evo, but anything with a rogue or DK and its a 0 or 1-5 lobby :(
[5:32:01] ALLtheEXP: all triple melee lobbies
[5:32:44] baxter5569: so many blenderballs since AWC because of Le Pomp
[5:32:59] baxter5569: and solo shuffle is dumb enough that it works
[5:33:00] ALLtheEXP: fkn Le Pomp
[5:33:14] Borngood: Rsham is nuts, looks fun to play
[5:33:28] baxter5569: train fistweaver or you lose. its the only strategy lol against a fister
[5:33:41] ZealotryTV: @Borngood no way rsham is bad Kappa
[5:33:56] zachgamegodx: man saul on rsham
[5:34:11] baxter5569: @Borngood its insanely fun when things are going your way. you have so many ways to make a play
[5:34:13] ramenxo: its wild dh can just cross entire map to kick healer and then instantly recross map to do infinite dam to lock
[5:34:26] zachgamegodx: ye hes offline mode
[5:34:31] ramenxo: dhs can literally just be anywhere they want anytime
[5:34:31] Hobblefoot: 1800 2s player perspective:  DHs can die to Outlaw/MW at this MMR but not until deep dampening and you tend to have to kill the healer in the end.  Thank you that is all.
[5:34:38] Borngood: Saul knows what’s good 😌
[5:34:38] stealthwalker99: Saul is online mode, now that's a troll I don't troll
[5:34:47] Borngood: Happy v day to you my guy
[5:34:59] baxter5569: @Hobblefoot most just hit W, take em behind a pillar and they willl die. then rage that they didnt get heals
[5:35:15] StromicusRex: i have returned
[5:35:20] zachgamegodx: @stealthwalker99 ur saying its not saul?
[5:35:33] Kymagez: hides
[5:35:35] MrKitty92: Oh it's Roxxy! Love that dude
[5:35:41] crosska1: @Hobblefoot 1900 rshaman here with bm hunter we eat dhs everyday
[5:35:43] ALLtheEXP: @StromicusRex wb bb
[5:36:13] chizzad52: Just wait until its triple melee on you as a caster rofl

[5:41:53] bruce_t_wayne: is there a possibility of showing a little arcane action?
[5:42:13] IIyena: @ZealotryTV biggest problem is how tanky they are for how much damage they can constantly do.
[5:42:16] stealthwalker99: @zachgamegodx He is online on bnet just not in game he only has 1 bnet account so it's not him I am pretty sure
[5:42:29] zachgamegodx: 100% him
[5:42:33] whitewallss: they both aflk

[5:45:26] socbrotes: did you end up catching some games with foxy last night?
[5:45:50] IIyena: def
[5:46:00] bruce_t_wayne: weird how leather wearing elfs are more tanky than plate and have magic resistance because of lore reasons
[5:46:47] Yanari_x: Frost mage is so cool
[5:47:01] ramenxo: im literally a survival hunter and i think im the easiest spec to kill in the game
[5:47:25] ramenxo: 1 little piss wall

[5:48:08] bruce_t_wayne: lol
[5:48:10] Badasti: subbing to supa from now on
[5:48:16] Badasti: those jokes are awful

[5:49:18] ramenxo: my sub runs out in 2 days i think thats all she wrote this season for me boys. last double dh lobby just took it all out of me

[5:52:56] ALLtheEXP: @lilknarcyon SQUIGGLY
[5:53:14] stealthwalker99: I find it's most annoying when it's double dh or dh/outlaw, they're immortal so it's always a kill healer angle or a very long game
[5:53:24] lilknarcyon: you didn't do it right
[5:55:40] Tyferious: Whatif you dont want too?

[6:44:56] Hobblefoot: So far an excellent tier list
[6:44:59] Dawudz: FUry s tier
[6:45:00] figurines: put aug down there with the tanks.
[6:45:03] Dawudz: kewwwk
[6:45:14] Hobblefoot: @Dawudz I love optimists.
[6:45:19] BetterknownasJohn: blood dk goes to b tier
[6:45:20] FateIRL: healers first
[6:45:23] CabinetMistake: dooey decimal
[6:45:26] Badasti: id just follow the order of the icons
[6:45:37] figurines: what MMR/Cr is this tier list? I feel like that matters these days
[6:45:45] Garthd: Pain
[6:46:15] FateIRL: fire is D
[6:46:16] Hobblefoot: So far so good
[6:46:20] CabinetMistake: going through this fast lol
[6:46:22] figurines: Frost DK def. above fire mage. cmon son
[6:46:30] Venallafat: the truth is out :(
[6:46:30] figurines: frost DK actually got wins in AWC
[6:46:35] Badasti: kind but i think fire is pretty dogshit
[6:46:35] e10100111001: FDK has setup and burst
[6:46:42] Hobblefoot: WAIT ..... @venruki Is this overall, Solo, 3s or 2s?
[6:46:54] Garthd: we have enough 45 min tierlist videos out there, a fast one is good :D
[6:47:00] FateIRL: unholy is A
[6:47:00] ryanblue98: @Hobblefoot he said considering everything
[6:47:01] petkicklol: i'd say its b+
[6:47:08] notoriousztv: it was S tier 2 patches ago :( :( :(
[6:47:10] Hobblefoot: @ryanblue98 Thank You
[6:47:11] kingceejay90: UH is low A
[6:47:13] BetterknownasJohn: @petkicklol for you
[6:47:14] atoker: uhdk got nerfed a bunch
[6:47:18] Rakitotv: unh in the right hands is A tier but for comps its a B
[6:47:21] Badasti: poor Mes in AWC
[6:47:29] Badasti: sitting middle of the arena with nobody to deathstrike
[6:47:33] Rakitotv: B+
[6:47:49] ZahirySvantovit: UH DK is trash and has no defensives
[6:47:50] CabinetMistake: c- like worse than frost and fire?
[6:47:51] Hobblefoot: @venruki I think Frost is D but I won't argue because of the grips, slows and small burst windows that you can normally counter pretty easily.
[6:48:07] Dawudz: fury warrior is atm at least a tier
[6:48:22] ryanblue98: @Dawudz no way its so bad
[6:48:31] ryanblue98: not one glad plays furry
[6:48:50] CabinetMistake: one of the coolest icons too
[6:48:55] iiiidan1994: what is this for when change will happen
[6:48:56] Hobblefoot: Yeah if there was a B+ I would put Devo there.
[6:49:04] Badasti: I think balance is better than arcane personally
[6:49:11] wtfidkx: feral should be B
[6:49:31] Hobblefoot: We prefer not to even think about that Evoker spec. Don't bother with it.
[6:49:33] Badasti: clone and root beam + insta unkickable dam... Also with everyone playing shamans mages get dispelled
[6:49:33] Yaycarrots: HmmMeeting
[6:49:34] Garthd: SP feels like B
[6:49:39] Rakitotv: ele B tier
[6:49:43] CabinetMistake: aff? PauseChamp
[6:49:46] Kymagez: lol ok bs
[6:49:51] Zlipps: Spriest is not A
[6:49:55] astrry: ele feels like S
[6:49:56] Dairuid: ya
[6:49:59] Hobblefoot: Yeah I agree. Shadow B
[6:50:03] kingceejay90: as long as ret daddy is S :D
[6:50:03] Kymagez: frost fkin pumps
[6:50:05] BetterknownasJohn: disagree sp is A
[6:50:08] CabinetMistake: B+ at least like above unholy no?
[6:50:18] Hobblefoot: So far this list is almost perfect. Agree on Destro as well.
[6:50:18] e10100111001: destro is gud
[6:50:21] Badasti: i dunno, do we think a frost mage could have won cup 1 like shadow did? I doubt it
[6:50:24] Rakitotv: nope
[6:50:28] Diabolicalz: Compared to other casters yeah I'd say destro is S tier, but compared to any melee for SS nah
[6:50:28] zachgamegodx: sitl disagree on SP being B!!!
[6:50:31] astrry: ele is a strong contender
[6:50:35] petkicklol: sp is defo A
[6:50:41] Hobblefoot: 100% ... With the portals and the consistent instant cast damage for sure.
[6:50:41] bruce_t_wayne: fair
[6:50:45] x9nwc: the right SP can be really strong
[6:50:46] serumtwitch: just explain why is destro better then Demo
[6:50:46] CabinetMistake: what do you think it has that other casters don't that brings it up to S?
[6:50:48] zachgamegodx: yes petkick
[6:50:50] zachgamegodx: yesss
[6:50:51] Merkflare: shadow is A
[6:50:52] e10100111001: low a for sp, agree

[6:51:23] NPBeharry: arms is b
[6:51:27] potkopvp: ele is b, very little control over games in shuffle, all it has is dmg and stops
[6:51:29] Hobblefoot: I find Aff really hard to kill. You sure about C Tier.  Anyone think Aff is a pain to kill?
[6:51:36] Lugges48: b

[6:53:47] CabinetMistake: you guys are making him pull up the facts and logic
[6:53:53] flowz96: ret and ww is better than unh
[6:53:56] Hobblefoot: @quzan92i Because it is. I keep trying to fight it but it is all the pain in the ass utility, mobility and defensives they can rotate through so fast.
[6:54:00] quzan92i: @clicket yes im fine ty man how are u
[6:54:02] wtfidkx: DH def isn't S tier - not a single DH team made it far in AWC - why would it be S tier?
[6:54:10] healmeshammy: what
[6:54:19] zachgamegodx: @wtfidkx xD
[6:54:23] quzan92i: @hobblefoot okay good to know ty
[6:54:33] galadice: lmaooo
[6:54:37] flowz96: hahaha
[6:54:38] kingceejay90: yeah he had his screen off
[6:54:44] galadice: bro had something else on his screen
[6:54:46] strafekey: that’s gotta be troll
[6:54:47] Flokko: WW IS B but outlaw is low on that list so its not a good arugment
[6:54:55] quzan92i: dk much about Outlaw in arena just play wpvp
[6:54:55] Shashka76: Where's aug?
[6:54:58] Shashka76: I don't see it
[6:54:59] Hobblefoot: LOL that is a bad take @wtfidkx ... With all due respect they are really good and well rounded right now in every bracket.
[6:55:08] Lugges48: hes trolling...
[6:55:21] Hobblefoot: @venruki FINALLY.... HOBBLE WINS
[6:55:22] e10100111001: yeah... dh is cray cray
[6:55:23] pipefull: dh is so oppressive
[6:55:32] Badasti: I think it is as well. imo only reason there are more rogues is because top players have mained rogue forever
[6:55:36] SpeedyMcD: dh damage is absurdly overtuned. its so obvious
[6:55:40] steebet: isn't outlaw only good at emphasizing the OPness of actual S-tier dps specs
[6:55:41] flowz96: that looks better
[6:55:41] atoker: that's actually better now
[6:55:44] galadice: dh can do crazy dmg, high mobility, decent CC and good defensives
[6:55:44] astrry: is this shuffle specific? I think ele deserves being reconsidered
[6:55:44] Hobblefoot: @pipefull That is the perfect word.
[6:55:56] whitecrox: Nah arms is def a solid B
[6:55:57] clicket: Enhance if played by Bigdam is A tier
[6:55:59] GalachadQT: ret is B tier
[6:56:00] Badasti: I think both boomie and sp are better than arcane mage tbh.
[6:56:00] Hobblefoot: BM B for sure
[6:56:03] Lugges48: bm a
[6:56:06] Hobblefoot: Marks is not B ....
[6:56:09] quzan92i: DH is a Arms/Fury/Outlaw mix Up like Mobility,DMG,Defensive and self heal insane
[6:56:09] mackypawp: think bm is a
[6:56:09] LiLb444: The sheer amount of everything that DH has is insane
[6:56:10] judyahn: surv and MM C
[6:56:13] nameyourform: just bm
[6:56:13] galadice: MM C
[6:56:13] GalachadQT: assa is B tier
[6:56:13] Hobblefoot: If you sit Marks they are useless.
[6:56:14] Cerialz2200: bm a
[6:56:15] zachgamegodx: sv is hard to place i have no idea where id put it
[6:56:15] Jamzy: bm is above marks and surv

[6:56:25] Aaleea: f
[6:56:25] galadice: B
[6:56:25] Hobblefoot: OMG you Survival Hunter haters.
[6:56:26] Smexxin: i think fury is better than ppl give it credit for, personally
[6:56:27] Dawudz: WHO PLAY dh in this chat?
[6:56:28] petkicklol: assas is b prob
[6:56:29] GalachadQT: assa B
[6:56:29] petkicklol: sub a
[6:56:31] Badasti: probably both b
[6:56:34] quzan92i: @joey10100111001 and gets hit hard
[6:56:37] fovven: sub b, ass c
[6:56:39] zachgamegodx: sub A
[6:56:41] fovven: ass dies to easy
[6:56:41] LiLb444: BM maybe B+
[6:56:42] e10100111001: @quzan92i true
[6:56:43] honsou2: sub A tier or S
[6:56:48] Synthetic29: ass feels closer to c tier
[6:56:49] ryanblue98: @Smexxin Kappa
[6:56:50] Yanari_x: Sub A
[6:56:50] Hobblefoot: Surv better than Assa.  Okay I am done about Surv. LOL
[6:56:53] zachgamegodx: do an A+
[6:56:53] quzan92i: @joey10100111001 sadly brother
[6:56:54] nameyourform: @Smexxin werent u queing it last night vs liquid and owning?
[6:56:55] galadice: sub is not A
[6:57:00] Locturnal_TV: low a
[6:57:02] McLarge: Sub enables the best casters too well to be below A
[6:57:02] zachgamegodx: A+ and A
[6:57:02] Synthetic29: sub b
[6:57:03] Smexxin: yup @nameyourform
[6:57:05] Synthetic29: ass c
[6:57:09] Babsx0: if sub is B assa has to be c
[6:57:10] honsou2: @galadice sub just won EU AWC "Not A tier " LUL
[6:57:10] Hobblefoot: Still S in my humble opinion.
[6:57:13] baxter5569: A at high elo, C/D for low elo
[6:57:14] B_Kal: sub = B, look at stats
[6:57:17] noctisxnoire: any addons recs? @venruki
[6:57:20] nameyourform: yeah @Smexxin was doing some insane dmg as fury last night
[6:57:22] Yanari_x: Sub is lower A tier for sure
[6:57:24] StarShopping95: Frost D, Unholy C. Every spec in B is better than Unholy
[6:57:30] steebet: @Smexxin i wish you would stream your fury games
[6:57:31] galadice: @honsou2 doesnt mean it's a tier
[6:57:31] zachgamegodx: u can add a teir above A tier by pressing the cog whgeel on the right of the row
[6:57:31] Zlipps: What is your baseline to determine all this though? arena ladder, solo ladder, AWC representation, 1v1's?
[6:57:34] Cudsfab4: considering sub can do half the dps of all those classes and still win just based of cc and its still low a is funny
[6:57:41] Hobblefoot: Oh good counter point "The Exception is not the Rule"
[6:57:44] Badasti: im happy to put Fire mage in D tier so that Fury isn't alone LUL
[6:57:45] Smexxin: so fury is the hardest spec to play in the game? :O got it
[6:57:56] steebet: fury is definitely better than D tier
[6:57:56] quzan92i: @smexxin yessssss
[6:57:58] Nateypww: remember when kalvish went sub into that awc team and reversed swept them
[6:57:58] nameyourform: @Smexxin what does fury need in your opinion?
[6:58:01] CabinetMistake: in my low cr experience warriors get trained a lot in RSS
[6:58:05] Telarius1: is this shuffle or 3s tier list?
[6:58:05] Ultramagnus85: its not hard to play its just not good
[6:58:07] Dawudz: WHO play fury here?
[6:58:11] whitecrox: Arms
[6:58:11] Hobblefoot: S Tier is perfect so far.
[6:58:11] astrry: also isn't boomkin a bit too high? it's giga squishy, this has to counteract clone being obnoxious
[6:58:11] Badasti: sub and arcane mage
[6:58:11] Incin_gaming: pretty sure arcane is or fire is
[6:58:13] x9nwc: RET
[6:58:13] GalachadQT: ret ret ret ret
[6:58:14] honsou2: ret can go B tier
[6:58:14] fovven: sub
[6:58:15] TheBiggestManOnCampus: shadow priest
[6:58:16] loopermann: sub is crap if not carried
[6:58:17] quzan92i: Wars needs more Mobility ssheeeeesh
[6:58:18] aaggros: demo is prob b
[6:58:19] Flokko: arms
[6:58:19] Venallafat: rogue

[6:58:21] Telarius1: no shot
[6:58:21] NPBeharry: arms is b I think
[6:58:21] Shashka76: Shadow priest
[6:58:21] bruce_t_wayne: ww
[6:58:23] Telarius1: ret is storng a.f rn
[6:58:24] Ultramagnus85: ret and shadow
[6:58:28] Synthetic29: Sub b tier
[6:58:29] Sosatko: If som1 actually thinks ret is B their just bad at it lol
[6:58:30] StarShopping95: no shot ret's are trying to say they're not A KEKW
[6:58:33] Incin_gaming: ret may be s tier honestly
[6:58:33] astrry: boomkin
[6:58:33] Shashka76: Shadow priest is B
[6:58:34] honsou2: then none of the specs can go down
[6:58:34] Synthetic29: assassination c tier
[6:58:35] Teatti: SP
[6:58:37] Telarius1: there are alot of noob ret players tho
[6:58:38] Yanari_x: Ret is not B
[6:58:40] TheBiggestManOnCampus: shadow
[6:58:41] nameyourform: BOOMKIN B TIER
[6:58:42] GalachadQT: ww bias
[6:58:44] Nateypww: sub is low s tier
[6:58:46] cloorogue: thoughts on assas?
[6:58:47] Shashka76: SP
[6:58:47] pipefull: ww shits on ret in shuffle
[6:58:48] Zlipps: spriest by itself is b
[6:58:48] stankbigly: Demo/Bal B tier imo
[6:58:50] Blastmindx: i think spriest is only A tier if you are absolutely insane at it
[6:58:50] Swingingwilly: I’m a 1600 player and I got fury to 1850 it can’t be that bad
[6:58:53] nameyourform: BOOMKIN DEFF B TIER
[6:58:54] flyingorangee: sub KEKW
[6:58:54] steebet: should bump boomkin to S tier but i am a biased boomie hater
[6:58:55] Ceelottv: U can put balance and sp in B
[6:58:59] archtme: demo to b?
[6:59:02] wtfidkx: i'd say feral is B /shrug
[6:59:02] Yanari_x: Feral is D tier imo
[6:59:08] Hobblefoot: Except for Survival it is a very good list.
[6:59:10] whitecrox: I think arms is not A
[6:59:11] Dopaminex: disc
[6:59:12] Lugges48: disc mw evoker
[6:59:12] NPBeharry: hpal
[6:59:12] junkyarddog4: holy
[6:59:13] BetterknownasJohn: ret is A on their own, WW is A because of the comps they work in
[6:59:13] nameyourform: H PRIEST
[6:59:14] Noscoc: hpriest
[6:59:14] CabinetMistake: don't say it
[6:59:14] Synthetic29: holy
[6:59:14] Badasti: disc
[6:59:14] gdodmebxu: dissc
[6:59:15] cloorogue: holy
[6:59:15] CabinetMistake: D:
[6:59:15] FlyingPuncake: evoker Pog
[6:59:16] Ultramagnus85: Preservation
[6:59:17] G00DGooglyMoogly: h priest
[6:59:20] TCVisMMN: hpal
[6:59:20] reaperz14: mistweaver
[6:59:22] zachgamegodx: Caster MW
[6:59:28] Yanari_x: Disc
[6:59:28] IrishEthics: @venruki what are these lists with respect to? like solo, team 3s?
[6:59:29] Hobblefoot: Oh how the mighty have fallen.
[6:59:30] Dopaminex: disc is so garbonzo
[6:59:37] LiLb444: Pres
[6:59:45] stankbigly: why is disc D??
[6:59:47] ButtaTWD: fw s+ god tier
[6:59:53] Swingingwilly: resto shaman d tier vs Druid heal
[6:59:59] stankbigly: that needs explanation
[7:00:00] VetisBR: strong disagree.
[7:00:11] Dopaminex: rsham over rdruid tho
[7:00:23] Lugges48: only shuffle druid is better
[7:00:26] that_man_ski: An official "Support" role needs to be added and given to Aug Evoker/Disc Priest/FW Monk.... and monks need a 4th tree like druids.... IMO :-D
[7:00:27] Hobblefoot: @stankbigly Because they nerfed the damage they do so much that they playstyle that they rely on is really not nearly effective.
[7:00:28] Badasti: imo Resto shamans are why arcane cant be high A
[7:00:30] Dopaminex: i'm surprised you think ret is so high
[7:00:32] reDonkeyless: DH needs to transcend S tier IMO
[7:00:33] Badasti: holy priest imo
[7:00:34] McLarge: I think HPala is actually pretty good too. Idk if it's necessarily S tier, but I don't think it should go below A tier
[7:00:36] VetisBR: fw and caster monk are 2 diff healers
[7:00:36] Badasti: and pala
[7:00:39] Lugges48: none of them tbh
[7:00:41] unsteddy: holy p[
[7:00:41] reaperz14: pala a tier
[7:00:43] Lugges48: they are all b
[7:00:43] e10100111001: hpal low a
[7:00:44] lolcraftv: Ret War is B wtf
[7:00:46] Yanari_x: H priest A
[7:00:52] StarShopping95: @lolcraftv LOL
[7:00:52] Dopaminex: i feel like ret and dk suffer from the same thing - limited comps but in those comps they shine really hard
[7:00:55] CabinetMistake: i want pres to be A because it's so fun PepeHands
[7:00:55] wicked_wizurd: pala a the rest b
[7:00:55] Dopaminex: ret and unholy
[7:01:02] petkicklol: ret has utility
[7:01:03] petkicklol: dk doesnt
[7:01:08] Swingingwilly: better be anyything other than Druid then it’s d
[7:01:09] StarShopping95: Ret has way more utility for the team
[7:01:11] honsou2: @Dopaminex ret is way stronger than unholy
[7:01:13] whitecrox: Arms is B
[7:01:13] zachgamegodx: paladin if shuffle is in the equation i suppose, pres and holy priest are about equal, idk where to put mw bc ur not separating caster and crane monk
[7:01:13] astrry: ret = swiss army knife of utilities
[7:01:16] Lugges48: hpriest is ass jsut because the sub/ww did good with the incap fear^^
[7:01:16] NPBeharry: I don’t think frost dk is c tier
[7:01:16] Cudsfab4: ret and ww shouldnt be in a
[7:01:20] Hobblefoot: Holy Priest A; Holy Pally A; Resto A / S  .... Evoker B, Monk B
[7:01:22] totopunchertv: are u voting on how good they are or how good people use them in comps?
[7:01:22] NPBeharry: frost dk is d tier
[7:01:28] Dopaminex: yea fair enough
[7:01:30] ButtaTWD: rets insane wat
[7:01:33] Dopaminex: ig i think more highly of unholy
[7:01:38] Cvarks: good list
[7:01:51] lolcraftv: @StarShopping95 If you don't see a ret war with monk fw those two melees are nothing, they are the worst melees compared to the rogue, monk ww and DH
[7:01:59] honsou2: @Dopaminex well stop that
[7:02:02] ButtaTWD: do you think arcane isn’t low S?
[7:02:10] Dopaminex: nah ww is not S tier
[7:02:15] StarShopping95: @StarShopping95 that's cope
[7:02:16] pipefull: ww in 2v2 is S tier
[7:02:20] Lugges48: has ret or ww more good comps?
[7:02:26] horiqt: Disc Sees a Lot of Play as well ans u say ist shit
[7:02:27] Dopaminex: but i think ww has a higher comp selection than dk maybe
[7:02:32] lolcraftv: @petkicklol Ret only has the useful dispel, his immune and bop dispel them and the lay on of hands does not heal anything. Besides, it is weak with the nerf to the plates
[7:02:34] Telarius1: ELE is S 100%
[7:02:37] Dopaminex: bc it can pair better with casters and sub rogue
[7:02:46] Doxsis: which class should i play in destiny 2?
[7:02:53] Hobblefoot: Those people are playing with old tech, Ven.  WW was S tier before the masses knew how to deal with it.  The problem with WW is that it is countered pretty effectively  by really good players.
[7:02:54] Incin_gaming: the rest are bs
[7:02:54] Dopaminex: whereas dk and ret are only with melee/hunter
[7:02:55] Letudra: holy priest a tier i think
[7:02:58] loopermann: why is frost b tier?
[7:02:59] sorzhx: hpriest feels B
[7:02:59] Telarius1: Ele is S, anyone else think so? Swear its busted
[7:03:04] Dopaminex: tier list overall is incredibly accurate tho - S tier :)
[7:03:06] Wrathbb1: pres is F tier
[7:03:07] StarShopping95: catJAM
[7:03:07] Zlipps: what are you comparing all this against? because it would be a completely different list if you just did it against solo shuffle
[7:03:07] Lugges48: fw
[7:03:09] OjBarnes: Hpriest A tier
[7:03:12] Badasti: I'd put hpala and hpriest in A personally
[7:03:12] notoriousztv: pres
[7:03:13] bruce_t_wayne: b
[7:03:13] ihavesmokedcrack: How is shadow A? its terrible in shuffle and has 2 good comps in 3v3
[7:03:16] Hobblefoot: Holy Pally.  Holy Priest did very well in the AWC didn't it.
[7:03:20] kusoneko: Pres can be A
[7:03:20] ButtaTWD: destro is def better but arcane is prettty good
[7:03:21] wackpoetic: MW and Hpal A
[7:03:27] e10100111001: hpal dies way too easy to be s
[7:03:33] Incin_gaming: i think rest are B maybe holy priest is A'
[7:03:34] Telarius1: Ele did very well too overall, palyed alot
[7:03:36] petkicklol: fw is stier
[7:03:39] wackpoetic: both A
[7:03:39] Dopaminex: i think holy somewhat similar to sub - needs to be in very competent hands to shine
[7:03:41] Telarius1: A
[7:03:43] Flokko: A
[7:03:45] astrry: fw is obnoxious tier
[7:03:47] Yanari_x: Hpriest is underdog
[7:03:47] Hobblefoot: Punch is funny.  Either S tier in some comps and D in others.
[7:03:48] nameyourform: s tier for stupid
[7:03:49] Badasti: punchmonk isa gimmick, its either really good or really shit
[7:03:50] itstherealloki: b easily cc able
[7:03:52] Wrathbb1: holy priest is like feral: if you are a god its good, if not its worse than playing naked druid with no gear
[7:03:54] Yanari_x: fistweaver is B tier
[7:03:56] Reiumi_: KEKW
[7:04:13] Ultramagnus85: D
[7:04:14] neoxue: I think hpal is B
[7:04:17] e10100111001: 1 shadowcleave team
[7:04:18] nameyourform: CRUSADER BABY
[7:04:19] wackpoetic: feel like Hpriest is probably B tier but I didn't watch much of AWC
[7:04:19] Fukndibs: Hpal a tier? no chance
[7:04:19] loopermann: frost is a and ele si s
[7:04:21] Ultramagnus85: Pres D
[7:04:22] Badasti: crusader played pala
[7:04:22] Wrathbb1: crusader lol
[7:04:22] Fukndibs: more like a c
[7:04:23] Badasti: i mean
[7:04:26] Dopaminex: i know teams that practiced holy paladin but didn't touch them in tourney
[7:04:27] figurines: *crying in disc*
[7:04:28] Badasti: the Meistro is def A
[7:04:29] Dopaminex: like toonah for ex
[7:04:31] Wrathbb1: that yee
[7:04:32] Badasti: at least LUL
[7:04:34] bruce_t_wayne: i hate that theres so much specs in a tier
[7:04:35] Yanari_x: FW monk is not suitable for many comps
[7:04:36] stankbigly: hpriest better than disc?? idk man
[7:04:42] Lugges48: evoker is better than holy in real 3s
[7:05:10] stankbigly: explain the D rating...
[7:05:10] Badasti: did any mw monk do better than Crusader in AWC?
[7:05:14] Flokko: rmp
[7:05:17] stankbigly: cupid?
[7:05:17] nameyourform: jungle
[7:05:18] e10100111001: enh + sub + disc
[7:05:18] kgdutchy: cupid
[7:05:18] Cudsfab4: rmp?
[7:05:18] Dopaminex: i tried some outlaw and sub rmp with disc
[7:05:20] rizdane: rmp is bad
[7:05:20] neoxue: rmp but is outdone by rmd
[7:05:21] Dopaminex: both versions felt horrible
[7:05:25] McLarge: Disc is traditionally good with Jungle
[7:05:26] Cvarks: rmp is terrible
[7:05:26] Dopaminex: needed holy to win
[7:05:28] aaggros: What spec was bicmex healer?
[7:05:29] atoker: I like cleaves on disc
[7:05:30] ZahirySvantovit: lol Biased anti DK player, the entire class is worst than fury
[7:05:31] Badasti: i think people will play rmd rather
[7:05:32] Flokko: its good enough to do better than a fury warrior
[7:05:33] loopermann: disc assa sp/lock
[7:05:34] Hobblefoot: Jungle? Is that a thing?
[7:05:37] zombieDolfin: maaaybe jungle?
[7:05:46] zombieDolfin: Feral is so bad too though
[7:05:48] Yanari_x: Disc is bottomlicker
[7:05:52] Dopaminex: disc is bad except when it's in the hands of gorecki
[7:05:55] Dopaminex: swear he makes it work like no other
[7:06:00] Ultramagnus85: can you filter for after patch though?
[7:06:05] Hobblefoot: The only time I fear DK in arena is when I am on my Destro Lock.
[7:06:13] honsou2: how many of the 6 unholy dks are the same player
[7:06:13] Ultramagnus85: how many people have just stopped queing after farming there rating?
[7:06:15] Roidb0y: unholy dk havent been playing last 2 weeks
[7:06:22] petkicklol: to be fair theres 0 unholy dks qn besides yours truly
[7:06:23] WAXMURDERER: Unholy dk without rdruid maybe
[7:06:24] gdodmebxu: @Roidb0y not true
[7:06:25] akaCoast: Disc as D tier???
[7:06:28] TheNutcracka: well thats representation. so assuming everyone plays only what is fotm
[7:06:29] baxter5569: aug?
[7:06:30] Kaizensu: fotm tier list
[7:06:31] Dopaminex: im gonna be biased - i think frost should be a tier
[7:06:34] Hobblefoot: @venruki It pains me to agree but this is very accurate.
[7:06:34] Roidb0y: it is true
[7:06:35] mayfire15: well fury going to be lower just because arms is just better. but i still think unholy might be better than fury
[7:06:35] squarepusher_: tbf, spriest is awfully slim on the ladder.
[7:06:38] Dopaminex: frost is so good in 3v3 with the right comps
[7:06:38] stankbigly: lol there's no way you can say disc is D tier...i'm so shook
[7:06:45] Roidb0y: im the next highest dk behind petkick
[7:06:47] Dopaminex: frost mage *
[7:06:52] Wrathbb1: DH is hilarious right now
[7:06:52] ryanblue98: mistweaver isnt a
[7:07:03] Wrathbb1: makes me laugh whenever I have to heal against them
[7:07:03] SharWW: what is the best 3's comp atm
[7:07:08] rizdane: ehh dk doubling everyones dmg is kinda whack
[7:07:13] rizdane: dh*
[7:07:14] Hobblefoot: I love DH right now. I don't want it to change.  It is a fun alt to pop on from time to time.
[7:07:22] MachoGG: rsham better than rdru? actually not sure havent played in a min
[7:07:23] honsou2: @Hobblefoot ew
[7:07:23] daodjinn: @venruki how dare you if DH mains could read they would be mad at you !!
[7:07:25] myodoctor: ret is S+
[7:07:33] ryanblue98: @myodoctor you wish
[7:07:38] Yanari_x: MW/FW is probably B tier but everything else looks fine
[7:07:41] Dopaminex: great list 10/10 ven, i think very well reasoned and organized !
[7:07:46] akaCoast: Disc as D and Boomy being the same as arms is interesting
[7:07:51] Hobblefoot: @honsou2 I get it.  A lot of people feel that way.
[7:07:55] atoker: unholy dk was s tier last season
[7:07:55] ryanblue98: mw is b
[7:07:57] Flokko: YES
[7:07:59] Flokko: thank y
[7:08:02] myodoctor: fist weaver and ret are B individually
[7:08:04] noskinblondeguy: is thius shuffle
[7:08:04] SharWW: VDH is B tier
[7:08:05] noskinblondeguy: or 3s
[7:08:06] Ultramagnus85: boomy is really good ya'll crazy
[7:08:06] Flokko: disc is NOT worse than furyu
[7:08:09] boomkin_exploit: frost dk
[7:08:10] Telarius1: fury isnt rlly that bad
[7:08:11] ihavesmokedcrack: S priest
[7:08:12] flyingorangee: @daodjinn OMEGALUL
[7:08:12] NPBeharry: frost dk
[7:08:13] Dopaminex: fire mage is that bad man LMAO
[7:08:13] Badasti: I'd say fire is pretty close
[7:08:13] Falcanus: shaman in S tier is cracked, its literally only because of mana vs other healers
[7:08:20] flyingorangee: let fury be bad KEKW
[7:08:22] Yanari_x: feral si bad too
[7:08:23] jaydenn88: We need fury rework...
[7:08:25] aaggros: Honestly, MM has to be worse than fury
[7:08:30] Ultramagnus85: fury is def d
[7:08:30] noskinblondeguy: @venruki mm is close
[7:08:33] dailyshuffle: bm hunter b tier? maybe a?
[7:08:33] fovven: fire kinda sucks
[7:08:34] BoldrinXX: bajh plays fury sometimes
[7:08:34] petkicklol: @aaggros caster mw yes fw no
[7:08:37] atoker: fury has a one shot combo
[7:08:38] McLarge: I don't know why you think Fury is so terrible. I swear the only reason you don't see it is because Arms is better
[7:08:41] Hark0n: aug D tier tbh
[7:08:41] ooPickleRicKoo: @aaggros MM burst is pretty insane
[7:08:47] flyingorangee: feral d maybe or
[7:08:48] sp9o: where is ag
[7:08:50] Dopaminex: feel like fire and fury are similar levels of bad
[7:08:51] Yanari_x: Let's give furry a feral pet
[7:08:53] sp9o: aug?
[7:08:57] Dopaminex: both C tho maybe
[7:08:58] What_ln_Tarnation: fury better than fdk imo
[7:09:01] Hobblefoot: The problem is that Fury is not D Tier in lower MMRs but gets worse the higher you get.
[7:09:03] biofreaks: buff feral armor in cat form and allow cyclone to be casted in cat form.
[7:09:03] ooPickleRicKoo: aug is D tier
[7:09:05] Yanari_x: Aug sucks too
[7:09:05] noskinblondeguy: @venruki we need fire rmp back
[7:09:07] ihavesmokedcrack: Dont post this! its embarrassing
[7:09:09] atoker: the tier list is pretty good
[7:09:09] Badasti: glass cannon
[7:09:29] Dopaminex: REAL
[7:09:43] Ultramagnus85: damn now mages only have 2 good specs
[7:09:44] Moobot: Latest video "I 1v1'd Pikaboo In Arena As A Healer" view it here: youtu.be/GVBOfGril9w
[7:09:47] Dopaminex: fire blast, pyro, and phoenix flame actually hit SO bad without the talent
[7:09:48] Falcanus: if shaman is S tier ahead of resto druid, explain shuffle representation of rsham
[7:09:49] Badasti: yup
[7:09:51] Hobblefoot: Sounds D Tier to me when you describe it.
[7:10:01] draishu: fire is D tier
[7:10:02] boomkin_exploit: yaaas flame them
[7:10:03] itsrikodeine: @Falcanus zugzug outa my totems -cr
[7:10:07] Badasti: i mean frost isnt necessarily good, its ok
[7:10:11] akaCoast: Is holy really that much better than disc? im almost 2200 as disc never even touched holy
[7:10:15] Dopaminex: dude i feel like frost is slept on what do you think ? @venruki
[7:10:19] akaCoast: gonna have to try
[7:10:20] What_ln_Tarnation: yes
[7:10:22] Ultramagnus85: true
[7:10:22] Cvarks: arcane should never be the best
[7:10:22] noskinblondeguy: @venruki mm and surv have fallen off a cliff, bm is somewhat decent but fk the class does not hit hard anymore
[7:10:25] LokixSun: frost makes some specs look plain silly
[7:10:26] Brotali1ty: wow survival c tier?
[7:10:29] Ultramagnus85: arcane toxic af
[7:10:36] LiLb444: They have a pvp talent that focuses on flamestrike that's completely useless and its been in the game way to long
[7:10:40] What_ln_Tarnation: same applies to sub, its the most toxic of the rog specs
[7:10:41] Dopaminex: the more i play frost the more nuts i feel like it is
[7:10:43] nightmxz: fire is toxic too, you can't interrupt it and it just 1-shots you
[7:10:51] Dopaminex: like if you play with sub or outlaw with a druid
[7:10:55] nightmxz: when it's good*
[7:10:55] DrunkJoe14: Arcane is hella fun don't you take this away from me
[7:10:59] OpportunistHS: Is spammable spell steal the problem or can all mages do that?
[7:10:59] Badasti: anyone who claims frost is op is probably playing a warrior at 1500 mmr LUL
[7:11:00] ooPickleRicKoo: just made a mage named mahomes.. gonna play mage in new expansion
[7:11:09] Dopaminex: you can play around the win cons super hard with pre-cast glacials, frost bombs that can't be dispelled, and ray of frosts that can't be stopped
[7:11:11] danielbanks: I'm amazed at the amount of demon hunters saying they aren't op
[7:11:15] Dopaminex: speaks more to the comp than the spec tho i suppose !
[7:11:21] Volgi95: LUL
[7:11:21] wicked_wizurd: how could u ven!
[7:11:22] ThePdfreak: ITS YOUR FAULT
[7:11:32] potkopvp: frost should be the only pvp viable spec outside of gimmicks, too bad its design has been dog since legion
[7:11:32] Ultramagnus85: I think fewer buttons would I got like 40 keybinds
[7:11:33] Wrathbb1: wait it was YOUR FAULT THE WHOLE TIME?
[7:11:34] Dopaminex: feral frost randomly OP too
[7:11:34] What_ln_Tarnation: HOW COULD YOU VENRUKI
[7:11:36] Ultramagnus85: and I should have more
[7:11:38] Volgi95: I think the winey fanbase has more control than streamers
[7:11:38] Wrathbb1: Jesus ven how could you
[7:11:38] galifax2: there can be too many buttons which is a problem in classic
[7:11:40] ihavesmokedcrack: Few buttons doesnt but more impactful cc and less micro cc would
[7:11:41] Hobblefoot: NO ... He said fewer Addons would improve the game.
[7:11:44] squarepusher_: Queue the arcane mage dps video from ven
[7:11:45] McLarge: I think Sub/Fire/Hpriest is slept on. Fire might not do good sustained damage, but that comp allows it to burst in specific windows, and Fire definitely does enough burst damage to threaten a kill with Combustion
[7:11:58] Dopaminex: with a rogue i think you can blast that comp
[7:12:00] Falcanus: is this a 3v3 tierlist or overall
[7:12:03] Dopaminex: where things get sketchy as mage i swear is always into ele
[7:12:06] walokki: Frost way too many spells to use
[7:12:11] nightmxz: no point in playing anything other than arcane into rshams, just purge earth shied and dampen to win free
[7:12:16] Dopaminex: heard raiku saying something similar, ele actually just infinity counters all versions of mage
[7:12:16] danielbanks: Haha what he just said about frost vs that comp is so true
[7:12:19] Ultramagnus85: idk how people function without 40 damn keybinds too many damn buttons
[7:12:20] mayfire15: feral frost does seem really good. cdew was queing into it last night. they were beating it mostly but still
[7:12:20] DrunkJoe14: I just got into arcane mage and I stink at it but its so fun'
[7:12:24] Falcanus: cause rsham is one of the worst healers in shuffle
[7:12:30] Brotali1ty: is survival that bad in shuffle?
[7:12:31] Hobblefoot: Ah you are being trolled. Yeah fake rant.
[7:12:32] boomkin_exploit: i actually have video evidence of u saying exactly that
[7:12:37] aaggros: Well you should have lol
[7:12:37] Wrathbb1: excuse me im the psychotic ranter here
[7:12:43] sppttv: GIGACHAD Venruki is talking to me.
[7:12:45] Reiumi_: HUH
[7:12:45] Wrathbb1: please leave
[7:12:46] akaCoast: link it
[7:12:49] reavethederp: link the clip pog
[7:12:51] akaCoast: and  the check pvp
[7:12:53] kusoneko: schizo mode activated
[7:12:54] Volgi95: I have documents that will lead to the arrest of hiliary clinton
[7:12:57] Badasti: @naxiuuz you need to crack a window, I think you've been hotboxing your farts too long
[7:12:58] raspador: send the link
[7:12:58] ihavesmokedcrack: lol prob outta context
[7:12:59] Kaizensu: its a phub link tho
[7:13:04] reavethederp: 4Head
[7:13:05] boomkin_exploit: one sec let me get my deep fake going
[7:13:06] xkayne: you have to remember some of us are piss drunk when watching your stream.
[7:13:07] Dopaminex: great tier list btw, are you gonna post that on youtube soon you think ? @venruki
[7:13:07] slimthicknasty9999: I have proof of aliens
[7:13:25] Dopaminex: i missed the first like 80% of that, i hope to catch up on a random lunch break when it's on youtube
[7:13:35] ihavesmokedcrack: Ven your hair looks beautiful today!
[7:13:36] reavethederp: ever make 20k on pennystocks
[7:13:41] Hobblefoot: I have proof I made it to 1600 once. Can I borrow that deep fake?
[7:13:46] Zlipps: dabble in the crypto at all?
[7:13:47] HerbalAsp: i think people heard you say "i like simpler rotations with other buttons that are actually impactful" and decided to hear you wanted no buttons lol
[7:13:58] Dopaminex: i still do think that ret and unholy are super comparable in levels of power
[7:14:01] What_ln_Tarnation: i invest in fast cars and rolex watches
[7:14:04] Dopaminex: but i may be thinking more towards the beginning of the season than now
[7:14:10] potkopvp: what did you do as a job before/during wow?
[7:14:28] Flokko: (mortal strike)
[7:14:30] honsou2: @Dopaminex the beginning of the season isnt relevant dk has been nerfed 3 times
[7:14:33] akaCoast: and thats true
[7:14:33] Badasti: I think arcane is also prone to death when Resto shamans are meta and they can get purged. Grounding also sends all of your dam into the void
[7:14:36] BetterknownasJohn: Welcome to UHDK
[7:14:40] slimthicknasty9999: yea what was your previous job
[7:14:47] Myth_The_Wolf: Just played a shuffle lobby that every single paralysis I cast was broken by my team :)
[7:14:47] slimthicknasty9999: I’m guessing accountant
[7:14:50] DrunkJoe14: Thats kinda true but its fun havint to try and get off your arcane combo
[7:15:10] McLarge: @Dopaminex They've buffed Ret and nerfed UH a bunch since the start of the season
[7:15:19] What_ln_Tarnation: so like fdk
[7:15:19] bruce_t_wayne: whats your favorite class/spec to play rn?
[7:15:28] slimthicknasty9999: weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM weedtyFIARM
[7:15:34] Babsx0: do you think bringing back rune so you had a go outside of combust could help with fire mage?
[7:15:34] potkopvp: exactly what i thought when i came back to wow 8 months ago, from 4 year break
[7:15:37] CabinetMistake: o7
[7:15:41] Luigicamp: have fun
[7:15:42] Badasti: cya Ven, have a good evening
[7:15:43] pharmztko: rukiLove
[7:15:43] Saiyori: bye, have a good time
[7:15:45] Myth_The_Wolf: Goodbye forever
[7:15:46] junkyarddog4: ggs
[7:15:47] tinkbelledhtv: Mage frost
[7:15:48] What_ln_Tarnation: they celebrate vday in canada too?
[7:15:52] bruce_t_wayne: bye sir
[7:15:53] tinkbelledhtv: And warlock demo
[7:15:58] Badasti: the Meistro LUL
[7:16:03] nightmxz: have a good dinner :)
[7:16:06] Hobblefoot: Hook up young Kalvish
[7:16:12] Badasti: maybe you wil get him mid rant
[7:16:20] guccikikuchi: kalvish
[7:16:27] Yanari_x: vrusader raid
