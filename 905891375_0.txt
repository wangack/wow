[1:17:44] Zivs: Sloot comes back today HYPERS
[1:17:48] epiczplz: choreghast lul
[1:17:53] Sollice: I dont think its either. I think it is missing a ton of content
[1:17:58] idenkaz_: well KEKW
[1:18:03] Stoops21: islands for sure
[1:18:04] Todmeister9000: do you like torghast more than visions?
[1:18:07] subversv: it was supposed to be random, but its always the same layout
[1:18:08] MOLAR305: if you could solo islands, id be doing that for all that stuff
[1:18:09] Scarhearth: torghast more than islands
[1:18:10] Sollice: I dont think it will ever be great, but it good be good
[1:18:11] reinhardtdog: Sadly.. I... kinda liked... islands more..
[1:18:12] shimwood: I like Torghast more than islands, but I still have to drag myself to do it
[1:18:12] fewyn: i like torghast because of the difficulty and replayability... but i loved islands for rewards
[1:18:16] PoppaShot: islands way better than tourghast
[1:18:17] Jarlan23: islands were shorter chores so id rather have them than torghast
[1:18:20] Mallaes: Islindz! coxDerp
[1:18:22] Alaquane: I didn't like the time pressure of islands, but I liked their variety and scene changes more
[1:18:32] subversv: the end of wing bosses dropped loot token items didnt they during alpha and beta>
[1:18:33] peinen: I knew it was going to become a chore. The community was so high on it during the beta/release and now look at it, no one wants to run it and we will be forced to the the entirety of SL
[1:18:44] adambraz123: @Towelliee whats bst way to farm renown? ive only recently switched covenants asewll
[1:18:46] griffdog125: you atleast were able to make gold off islands
[1:18:52] Kromede: mushrooooms
[1:19:00] Karbonn: Torghast could be REALLY rewarding but they made it meh. Like... soul ash... that's it?
[1:19:24] Sollice: I think it was a mistake to not make torghast have some sort of competitive element. They didn't give us any of what they told us in terms of transmog
[1:19:30] Affiiance: One day they are gonna learn stick to whats worked forever, throw away shit like Torghast and give us more Raid/Dungeons
[1:19:36] dv_domino: dv_domino subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months, currently on a 45 month streak! you are the best, thanks for the job you do towelliee towHAMUP
[1:19:42] subversv: i think they assumed people would make lots of legendaries? but people make one or two
[1:20:06] Affiiance: Leggos are too fucking expensive to make them all
[1:20:29] peinen: Blizzard's legendary design is laughably bad.
[1:20:38] raldrik: it let you keep your back mog on?
[1:20:52] Sollice: @raldrik It will until he has to upgrade his clock
[1:20:56] yonkaaaa: I for one appreciate this way of making legendaries
[1:20:57] Jarlan23: dps warrior only has 2 as well
[1:20:59] miroc228: mm hunter
[1:21:03] miroc228: 1 lego
[1:21:09] trollkuehn: yeah and sometimes you have just lackluster legos
[1:21:11] Affiiance: Fuck the Soul Ash I dont wanna spend the Gold
[1:21:18] Sollice: The Rapid Fire one people are using but i dunno about how good it is
[1:21:19] GamesWithJT: I litterally only use one for defensive progression on Veng DH
[1:21:24] Bacanu34: Bm legos KEKW
[1:21:42] Bacon_21: @miroc228 craven is nice for pvp :P
[1:21:53] othraerir: tar trap is so shit
[1:21:55] Skaboy_TV: Wait. WHUT!? 5 Legos?!
[1:21:57] trollkuehn: tar trap is the biggest bullshit lego imo
[1:22:05] thebakeriscomingforu: holy sigil is so fun as a kyrian prot pally. all the avenger shields
[1:22:06] othraerir: good for m+ clunky for raiding
[1:22:06] Jarlan23: they should legit just get rid of surv and roll its abilities into bm and mm
[1:22:20] LycanKain: It's usable, if the tank sits still long enough for you to make it work
[1:22:21] Antdavs24: yea the tar trap is a gimmick lol its cool but you lose so much down time with it
[1:22:23] hildobagins: some of the raid fights it sucks
[1:22:33] Sollice: Tar Trap is good especially on high keys when tanks have to kite shit around
[1:22:34] hectabit: the tar trap lego sucks without a macro for it
[1:22:40] Sollice: But I dont know if the lego is any good
[1:22:43] othraerir: it's fine for m+ just raiding with bosses moving all the time
[1:23:02] hildobagins: i have a problem with sludgefist, the trap does not go off. buggy
[1:23:15] Sollice: @hildobagins Its very buggy
[1:23:31] Dragunstorm15: yes mm is better
[1:23:33] Sollice: I would love to try Survival for PVE. I am bored of MM
[1:23:34] Syllvn: I like survival tbh
[1:23:51] Affiiance: Lets be real, Surv Hunter and Demo Lock are dead to Blizz
[1:23:57] CholThemAll: swifty is playing survival, he's enjoying it

[1:24:16] drmabusee: swifty plays one
[1:24:21] mab_music_ttrpg: omg a mail tank !
[1:24:27] wezz_10: That would be dope
[1:24:27] Antdavs24: honestly i loved ranged SV but if they made it a tank spec id actually play it lol
[1:24:28] hoyhoy007: but if survival can be tank..then everything will be hunter weapon :(
[1:24:29] kalypselv: That rub fade tank
[1:24:40] raldrik: also having a mail tank would be nice
[1:24:44] MrGattz: it really is
[1:24:47] othraerir: parry rating ;)
[1:24:47] jimmytingus: enhancement shaman could hvae been a good tank class again. I'd play that
[1:24:50] dokor: a tank similar to the bounty hunter in star wars would have been great
[1:24:51] MrGattz: they could have did so much with it and they just didnt
[1:24:55] PvtHudson093: true true
[1:24:59] MrGattz: even if it was wrong they could have still did it
[1:25:01] Sollice: I think the first mail tank is going to end up being some sort of mage
[1:25:26] thebakeriscomingforu: tank with a pet out all the time. that would have been cool
[1:25:42] Jarlan23: pet tank swap in raids KEKW
[1:25:46] hildobagins: like boomkin trees
[1:25:51] ventu105: Morning yall
[1:25:51] LSBreed: lol, in bc rogues, and shamans could "tank" 🤣
[1:25:56] Sollice: Well look at Rexar in HoTS
[1:26:10] Sollice: Misha is tanky as fuck. And he is a ranged character
[1:26:21] PoppaShot: yall kiled terry KEKW
[1:26:26] AgentWhiskeyy: It would be cool like some pets are exotic, for there to be a tank only pets
[1:26:29] Wedgeh: He tweeted like half an hour ago
[1:26:29] PadidinJones: he did tweet 25 min ago
[1:26:31] Jarlan23: how is he ranged doesnt he use 2 axes
[1:26:38] Sollice: No
[1:26:40] Sollice: He throws them
[1:26:43] metavahn231: alright aint no pet tanking M+ thats going a little far
[1:26:58] Wedgeh: https://twitter.com/TerrybleGAMING/status/1358772952162963463
[1:27:33] Jarlan23: survival tank should be a mix of melee and ranged attacks with traps and cc

[1:41:17] borisdic: bro its close
[1:41:24] Affiiance: Perplexed is fucking good
[1:41:27] Jarlan23: yeah they lost to one team that starts with a P i think
[1:41:33] soysos91: yeah, first map on finals was super close
[1:41:34] borisdic: the finals is always good
[1:41:35] falldrgn: I think last time was a fluke.. bad game kinda thing. they won't look back
[1:41:37] Jarlan23: ya perplexed

[1:41:40] soysos91: Perplexed

[1:42:13] Affiiance: I feel like Golden Guardians are cursed
[1:42:14] borisdic: 2 more ithink
[1:42:26] Rottencoarse: it was really bad idd
[1:42:29] fewyn: if MDI was on twitch i'd watch it
[1:42:31] NILLme: it will get lower
[1:42:36] GermanBacon: i realy love seeing the same 6 classes everytime :)
[1:42:51] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee probs it's because they lost Lightee
[1:43:00] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee yoda as a tank is kind of worst
[1:43:02] jure__: de other side echo v perplexed was insane tho, loved it
[1:43:03] Mecabeast: its boring to see the same comps doing the same pulls imo
[1:43:05] Rottencoarse: *worse than lightee
[1:43:11] Thoreya: MDi is in a rough spot i really dont know what they shud do lol
[1:43:24] falldrgn: like class bans? That would not be a good idea
[1:43:29] luckfore: its boring to watch
[1:43:32] Affiiance: I say throw both teams in a dungeon with WM On and tell them go at it
[1:43:35] Thoreya: if they ban classes teams arent gonna have enough practice in to know how to play all classes
[1:43:35] Korupcija_: LULW
[1:43:36] Jarlan23: overwatch league viewership last year was dogshit as well
[1:43:39] Jarlan23: like 40k
[1:43:41] GermanBacon: @falldrgn why?
[1:43:48] borisdic: do it like they do it in lol they ban a class or something idk make it interesting
[1:43:52] Venkxx: they should dictate the classes they have to use, that would make me watch it
[1:43:54] fluh_: and the money rewards aint shit unless you're like first or second
[1:43:56] Trokuti: your ilvl?
[1:43:59] raldrik: I hate that all that stuff is one the weekend. I think they should look at worktime viewership vs weekend. I think they get more during the work day
[1:44:02] Skaboy_TV: Now that you're on Team Bluther, do yoiu retain your Venthyr xmogs?
[1:44:06] cevyr1: its like not having your esports on the worlds largest streaming site is a bad thing
[1:44:08] Mecabeast: do a roulette for race class spec cove
[1:44:14] SlayerLightStorm: @Trokuti 223.
[1:44:15] Korupcija_: official transmog comps would probably get more viewers
[1:44:15] NILLme: bet youtube is mad at blizz, OWL is canceled too LUL
[1:44:20] Affiiance: Was MDI even part of the deal? I know Youtube didnt even give a fuck about the Hearthstone shit, Blizz just threw it in for free
[1:44:28] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee blizz needs to do smth about the rewards tbh. Fem's team quit because of that
[1:44:33] Thoreya: seems like AWC is the only blizz esport doing kinda well lol
[1:44:34] PidiaP: Activision trying to stop paying for Blizzard esports by killing viewership with Youtube deal towTinfoil
[1:44:39] biihalia: I haven't watched any Blizz event since they stopped showing on Twitch.
[1:44:46] Williamgrs: just randomly pick 5 classes, which ofc are the exact same for both teams, where any player can claim one of those classes to compete
[1:45:04] zx10rx: @towelliee that’s why darkie said fuck it and went to play PoE. Blizzard pays shit for these tournaments
[1:45:06] northcub: Blizzard will announce the release of thier new game "Titan"
[1:45:09] falldrgn: @GermanBacon because they all basically run the same comps anyway. they would all just pick the second best class. We would be in the same boat
[1:45:18] Alaquane: throw money at it and I still wouldn't watch with the same classes
[1:45:21] Hybridwarhawk: How much is it now?
[1:45:29] Rottencoarse: 8k for winners @Hybridwarhawk
[1:45:30] jure__: like 200K or something :D
[1:45:30] borisdic: @Alaquane true

[1:45:33] Thoreya: if its still boring its still gonna be boring tho
[1:45:36] Thoreya: regardless of $$$
[1:45:36] peinen: LUL Bobby K giving away 10 mill LUL LUL
[1:45:39] Hybridwarhawk: 8k? Ouch
[1:45:41] deedeemegadoodooo: would definitely get better matches that way
[1:45:44] Holysal: @Alaquane there will always be a best class though
[1:45:45] falldrgn: They should do it like League or Dota.. and have some of it user funded prize pool
[1:45:50] wisperuna: @Towelliee they kill all competative games they have and you want a 5 mill prize pool
[1:45:51] bertooso: It’s not worthy of that amount it’s just a key not pvp
[1:45:54] wezz_10: OTK
[1:45:59] Affiiance: Thats people going for KSM
[1:46:02] borisdic: it would be cool if they previed stuff in the MDI like new affixes or dungeons
[1:46:19] L4dy_Renegade: @peinen He wouldn't give away $10. LUL
[1:46:20] Affiiance: You get an extra chance if you fail
[1:46:24] GermanBacon: @falldrgn its not about same comps on both teams. its that its always the same tank/heal and 3 out of 4 dds. not about the same comps on both teams.
[1:46:29] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @Towelliee well this year ff14 may have some people playing when they have the new expac this year
[1:46:33] bertooso: Love this music BibleThump
[1:46:35] Kinghorn: then blizzard kept the money LUL
[1:46:36] CADZtv: they took the money KEKW
[1:46:37] Holysal: yeah blizzard took that profits lol
[1:46:41] wisperuna: @Towelliee they took the money and made up an excuse
[1:46:43] jure__: it wasnt some shit, blizzard kept most of the money LUL
[1:46:46] smashwow: that money found it's way in blizz's pocket
[1:46:55] GermanBacon: blizzard went full Venezuela and pocketet the money those fuckers
[1:46:58] Korupcija_: do you enjoy pala or brewmaster more gameplay wise
[1:47:00] Kinghorn: never buying a funding toy again
[1:47:02] Holysal: we will never trust blizzard again with that
[1:47:08] CADZtv: but does bliizard have to do a crowd fund tho
[1:47:11] Alaquane: I've been enjoying ff14 after I got through that ARR storyline. revisiting HW was cool
[1:47:13] Kinghorn: if I could refund the beacon I would
[1:47:14] fistofnature: so is it lvl 50 or 60 for love rocket?
[1:47:16] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee they can put up the money the get from the toys etc for the prize pool?
[1:47:23] jure__: @fistofnature 50
[1:47:24] Gorestack: from all the crap things Blizz have done to WoW over the years, trying to rape the game into an e-sport is probably the most disgusting
[1:47:29] fistofnature: @jure__ thank god
[1:47:31] alextheory_: their just greedu
[1:47:33] WhiteKnight74648: Blizzard didnt contribute at all to the prize pool when crowd funded. Everyone was under the impression blizzard would still put their fair share in and blizzard said no and told us to read the fine print.
[1:47:35] Wintersteel: Someone start a gofundme for the prize pool...
[1:47:35] Kinghorn: they did and they pocked the money! @Rottencoarse
[1:47:36] SlayerLightStorm: @fistofnature 50.
[1:47:38] L4dy_Renegade: They want ALLLL that money.
[1:47:40] NILLme: pride LUL
[1:47:41] Kinghorn: pocketed*
[1:47:41] Venkxx: I wouldnt trust them with that, didnt they do that already, promised to match the amount but dropped out at the end? :D
[1:47:43] northcub: Blizzard didn't ruin WoW, the players did
[1:47:44] MrGattz: why are we funding it? blizzard has billions of dollars. if they want a tournament and they want it to succeed then they can fucking fund it.
[1:47:48] wisperuna: @Towelliee have you seen dota and redbull ?
[1:47:54] Rottencoarse: @Kinghorn oh ok
[1:47:57] zx10rx: Because they are greedy
[1:48:02] mo197: $2 mil from Epic
[1:48:08] othraerir: agree mrgattz
[1:48:22] 無職提督: they feared to lose control? i real dont know, man
[1:48:32] Gorestack: it's a combination of both. toxic elitist player mentality and Blizzard creating systems and content that enable and encourage that mentality. @northcub
[1:48:32] zx10rx: They want that cash shop money for impressing investors

[1:48:34] jure__: @MrGattz Because the only reason for MDI and AWCs existence is that Blizzard makes money off of it. They wouldnt make shit if they put millions into the prize pool.

[1:49:08] Erielle04: do you need a level 60 for love rocket
[1:49:09] MrGattz: yeah. the same can be said about valve. exactly. im not sure what the difference is
[1:49:29] Hitmanblood: @jure__ tournaments shouldn't be for profit. they should be costs for advertising and hyping your game.
[1:49:53] bertooso: To many boomers work at blizz i suspect, no offense to my boomers however
[1:50:07] smashwow: boomer has nothing to do with it
[1:50:14] L4dy_Renegade: We need that gif of Gaben super-imposed on the plate passer in church poking mr. burns in church. Kappa
[1:50:15] jure__: @Hitmanblood I agree, but this is Blizzard, they only do shit for a payout now. Its abundantly clear.
[1:50:18] smashwow: boomers know you should pay people
[1:50:23] MrGattz: @Hitmanblood im not sure if this is what you meant but you said advertising and i think tournaments prizes should be build into marketing budgets. because thats what it is. marketing.
[1:50:47] Alaquane: huge get
[1:50:53] Mallaes: 👀
[1:51:02] Epixil: did they fix love rocket to 50?

[1:51:33] Hazcore: theres an addon to optimize that
[1:51:45] Hitmanblood: @mrgattz that's what I mean. the prize pools should be apart of there marketing budgets. Blizz goal shouldn't be to make money off the tournament itself. but to get new subs and hype their games. All of blizz games fail because they have these small ass tournaments. they don't want to front the loss to make hype ass events.
[1:51:48] cowee12356995: LUL

[1:53:36] Solid0Liquid: I just got a mount off the theater of pain wq

[2:16:47] Kriven: dude layed out it and threw it side arm 40 yards and hit his wide out in the helmet in the end zone... he was not bad
[2:16:48] YardRage: Chiefs' receivers let half the passes hit them in the facemask too
[2:16:48] hulklock: he was pressured the most ever
[2:16:48] skruffie_: he would make some insane throw and receivers would just drop it
[2:16:49] Allvarez: dude was running all night
[2:16:50] CajunCrusader: That and the Chiefs D gave up too many penalty yards and big plays.
[2:16:56] magemaster225: Suh treated Mahomes like a ragdoll

[3:59:15] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: ignore my spelling
[3:59:33] bosseja: i think is too unrealistic
[3:59:35] jerseyfive: maybe make people play more m+... with giving them loot..
[3:59:36] Todmeister9000: have randomly assigned classes
[3:59:37] Sincline387: Random mob placement
[3:59:38] Armdel: tell blizzard to get better at balancing Kappa
[3:59:42] akia03: place both teams in same dungeon and enable pvp inside it
[3:59:43] Lemonmunch3r: MDI with shitty comps
[3:59:50] Clay2K_: that'd be awesome
[3:59:52] shimwood: Have opponents pick specs?
[3:59:55] Lemonmunch3r: Fastest 1 class clear
[3:59:59] Masqerader: map bans
[3:59:59] Hybridwarhawk: map/affix bans
[4:00:03] willy2777: i mean you can, just have it so 1st dungeon if you pick vengence dh then 2nd dungeon you cant have the vengence dh
[4:00:06] goblinknows: OMEGALUL
[4:00:09] Clay2K_: LUL
[4:00:12] Roffasauras: change affix every min Kappa
[4:00:14] kodtheog: that would be cool
[4:00:17] othraerir: make them think on the go, instead of having everything planned
[4:00:24] Armdel: didn't they have some run on the MDI where they dungeon had both fort and tyra
[4:00:27] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee That SB game was rough, not even the streaker for KC could make it into the end zone KEKW
[4:00:37] Sincline387: Random mob placement
[4:00:41] Vigi9413: spec bans
[4:00:44] bosseja: and they get godlike gear
[4:00:51] eximisprime: make the terregrue just roam around the dungeons, just like torghast.
[4:01:02] Sincline387: ohh that's a point item level variances would be cool
[4:01:04] Naganick: The only way you're going to not have meta picking, is to force teams to play a specific comp / specs
[4:01:06] ZabberzTV: chat votes doing match to chance things
[4:01:08] Mecabeast: start them a +2 and they race to get it to a +20
[4:01:24] Glando7: Have preset classes and specs
[4:01:26] TheHobbyLodge: could you put a drafting mechanic in like dota/league
[4:01:38] Foglatch: yeah, with picks and bans
[4:01:39] Minemanjoker: ban system like LoL, ban class and specs before the dungeon start?
[4:01:41] shimwood: Sadly can't do Twitch integration on YouTube :(
[4:01:47] Valient491: there's a rare mob there
[4:01:51] Vigi9413: each team alternates banning a specs, two each
[4:02:13] Foglatch: that would actually be neat, make teams think on their feet

[4:02:39] Dolfo3: WAIT
[4:02:41] ZabberzTV: ye
[4:02:42] Reklusion: Just have randomly spawned maps... xD
[4:02:44] othraerir: everyone has to play BM
[4:02:49] ZabberzTV: would be fun
[4:02:54] Clay2K_: @Towelliee do like a league of legends or Dota style intro where you can ban classes or keys
[4:02:55] Mecabeast: ban night elf
[4:03:01] Todmeister9000: then they would just ban the meta specs, and they will play the 2nd best specs, still boring
[4:03:01] Dolfo3: why dont they have a picks/bans for the MDI like league
[4:03:01] Phae__: Banning outlaw on Necrotic Wake LUL
[4:03:04] KingsandClubs: Yeah they should do a league system banning 1 class per team
[4:03:06] Maydie6066: Force them to play with a Prot War and MW monk
[4:03:11] Masqerader: it just feels like nothing they can do will fix it
[4:03:28] willy2777: i dont think banning would be good... then you just never see certain specs..just have it so if you use a spec once then you cant use it till you advance brackets
[4:03:40] Clay2K_: @Towelliee only Feral DPS towW towW
[4:03:42] Gorestack: infinitely scaling pve content is boring by default, meta specs or not
[4:03:48] ChangoRican: Mystery Hero like in OW
[4:04:00] traynor56: snake draft, each spec can only be picked once
[4:04:05] Thoreya: AWC doesn’t get stale bc it’s dynamic it always changes and that interests viewers
[4:04:08] Thoreya: Mdi doesn’t do that
[4:04:13] Minemanjoker: Make every boss Hogger?
[4:04:24] Vigi9413: Just quit MDI and join OWL and make real money
[4:04:28] Masqerader: Also its weird when you have a video game tourney with 0 sponsors
[4:04:28] Phillychick: @Towelliee Where the heck is the Love is in the Air event? I dont see anything but the Lunar event in Orgrimmar
[4:04:30] SilverMyr13: MDI>AWC
[4:04:32] ZabberzTV: yeah can only play spec once
[4:04:43] willy2777: ^
[4:05:01] Lemonmunch3r: No addons affix
[4:05:03] willy2777: would force specs per dungeon not just best overall
[4:05:16] Colt_Engineer: oh that part is awful

[4:06:03] zyrokor: easy clap

[4:06:52] Clay2K_: how much ash does a 190 lego cost to make?
[4:06:53] Sollice: @CaptainClench Weird?
[4:07:01] Phae__: @Clay2K_ 1250
[4:07:04] Roffasauras: every 20th tick
[4:07:05] duhworks: feel like pick and bans would help mix up the MDI and no doubles so both teams shouldn't have the same healers, DPS, tanks
[4:07:10] najra1989: overall
[4:07:11] Clay2K_: ty phae
[4:07:20] Phae__: np
[4:07:22] RunningOutOfRAM: I just tune in did tow did his run for love rocket ?
[4:07:24] Roffasauras: more moonfire = more moons
[4:07:27] Karbonn: every moonfire overall
[4:07:27] ThatW0lF: baer
[4:07:28] Clay2K_: @Phae__ so a 210 costs 2k ash if I make a 190?
[4:07:29] ThatW0lF: ;3
[4:07:32] Kallat11: Honestly just group them and put moonfire on everything
[4:07:47] WhatYeti: I thought love rocket was for level 60 only now
[4:07:50] Clay2K_: @Phae__ in total*
[4:07:54] WhatYeti: or is that just in Asia
[4:08:04] Sollice: @duhworks You really cant do no doubles. These people typically play 1 or two classes and tune it to perfection. It shouldn't be whoever picks it first wins. The quality of play wouldnt be good
[4:08:05] akia03: @Mipu 50 in eu
[4:08:12] Maydie6066: but i love that Torg has "broken" abilities, its supposed to be a "go ham, be silly OP". hell in a twisting corridors i got my ele sham to 210k HP, with a 60% additional Lust that popped when i dropped a totem, and lust gave me acendence, i was chunking Lava Bursts like a taco bell aftershit

[6:31:14] nocturnal_2195: I watched the final episode of supernatural and thought it sucked. I was pretty disappointed. with how many seasons they had you'd think the finale would at least be 2 hours long

[6:33:35] dragothicx: Prison Break, so good indeed POGGERS
[6:33:54] 91Niki: @Kromede Agreed. The ending caused a ton of people to hate it. But i think it's cuz they don't truly understand it

[7:33:15] Shrenko: fresh start + servers that can transfer their 60 toons
[7:33:15] CADZtv: if they get rid of classic then private servers will pop up again
[7:33:21] Roffasauras: giving people a 1 month "start" period on fresh servers before tbc releases it'll be optimal imo
[7:33:25] Lightemp: @Towelliee also with all the gold there is in classic
[7:33:28] ghostofnappa_doom: swapping to an ally toon sorry be liek 10 secs
[7:33:35] Noshpan: I remember one time when MANvsGame played a bit of WoW on his stream. He was on a pvp server & the stream sniping was so bad that they were harrassing him on Alliance alts. So he had to report them.
[7:33:46] Shrenko: I hope not
[7:34:11] silverknight16: Anyone know if low level toons doing Love Rocket runs can actually get the love Rocket?
[7:34:16] Affiiance: Character copying seems the most likely
[7:34:25] azuriens: What about the whole transitioning classic to TBC but then also giving the option of a permanent 60 server/client
[7:34:28] dracullus: or move game to TBC and start Classic again in few months
[7:34:44] Alaquane: @SilverKnight16 You must be level 50 to get a purple heart box, only the purple box has a chance to get mount

[7:35:15] RocketMan23: Classic Andy
[7:35:41] dracullus: and they will do what exactly?
[7:36:13] Gladiator816: BC was incredible. I really enjoyed vanilla-cata. I kinda quit playing after
[7:36:21] Gladiator816: Just came back
[7:36:24] Repsifu: hey Towel, what do you think on Sloot's move, BDGG main tank / moving to US after 5 years in Future - EU ?
[7:36:33] Noshpan: I think adding progression servers would be a good idea.
[7:36:44] Shrenko: if the classic players are not able to transfer their lvl 60's over to a TBC server they will flip their shit @Towelliee
[7:36:44] OneTrickSETT: how much you go to the Gym a week ? @Towelliee i think im going to start
[7:36:50] azuriens: I'd be interested in fresh but I think people will be unhappy with having to go through name reserve again.
[7:37:16] Repsifu: oh, sorry, was busy with the kid, oke brother, will check em out :P guess i'm late for the show
[7:37:21] H0L3S: Wait, so did they decide that TBC will be fresh servers??
[7:37:31] Le_Masque: MoP servers when ? HYPERS
[7:37:37] jdickson93: starting with fresh toons in TBC might kill it for people that dont want to lvl to 60 again tho?
[7:37:48] Alienfromger: who dont want to level again? cmon
[7:37:54] jdickson93: also people might want items they have in classic for TBC
[7:38:12] KingSlayerYotam: @Repsifu he thinks ted's move was a good one for him and bdgg
[7:38:15] Gladiator816: 20ms what a dream I have 80 & 30 FPS lol
[7:38:15] Strik3r019: my realm couldn't get pass the 2nd raid the whole time bc was up but ti was fun
[7:38:18] dcmaniac11: Towelliee I’m late to the party have you said if u think TBC will ever release?
[7:38:22] CADZtv: @Alienfromger nobody it just something has to be done cause it the same anymore
[7:38:32] CADZtv: that has*
[7:38:37] jdickson93: like a PTR type thing?
[7:38:38] Gladiator816: @strik3r019 Same, our guild got hard stuck in ZA
[7:38:41] CritcobainTV: i REALLY hope i don't have to level from 1 on a blood elf FeelsBadMan
[7:38:44] CADZtv: not the same*
[7:38:46] j_bar111: @Towelliee so just copy them not move them
[7:38:52] CADZtv: holy fook i cant type
[7:38:58] ghostofnappa_doom: you think they should do some sort of cap on gold you can bring over to BC? like a cap of 1k gold or soemthing so the economy isn't immediately destroyed on launch
[7:38:59] Masqerader: basically the ptr copy character
[7:39:22] dragothicx: Starting at lvl 58 gotta be one time option though? in Classic TBC
[7:39:45] Masqerader: but at the same time, what else is left to do in classic?
[7:39:52] luckfore: do ppl still play classic?
[7:39:57] jdickson93: @dragothicx either that or maybe you get a "level 58 character boost" for each 60 you have in classic?
[7:40:03] dracullus: @Towelliee Blizzcon panels will be live or pre-recorded?
[7:40:16] Kyrrua: no one would not want to go through lvl 60 again if they do fresh, cuz everyone is gonna follow the hype and streamers anyway. Leveling is THE moment of connection with streamers/hype/rush challenge

[7:40:35] Alienfromger: WutFace
[7:40:35] CADZtv: what if they limit it to mounts and legendary items when copying
[7:40:38] dragothicx: @jdickson93 yea it's complicated, you could have multiple 60's in Classic but don't want to allow "free 60's" either in TBC
[7:40:40] idenkaz_: this is just wrong man
[7:40:40] luckfore: pre recorded, they already recorded it

[7:48:47] ghostofnappa_doom: i think brewmaster feels amazing, i mean i got KSM a month and ahalf ago on my tank. it's a fine tank
[7:48:50] waterboy821: I feel like my bear is better for the same ilvl right now. Both are 190ish

[8:25:17] kharnij83: @Towelliee did u see EA is going to give another crack at a Star Wars shooting game
[8:25:18] Todmeister9000: let's hope battle pets are coming to a phone game
[8:26:00] shimwood: @Jar_jar_b WoW Go LuL
[8:26:07] Bayne77: battlepets GO?
[8:26:11] CDubTheRIPper: that would be sick, using reindhardt as a tank
[8:26:21] Masqerader: battlefront 2 was blah
[8:26:22] Venkxx: I dont really like doing pet battles ingame, but I would definitely like doing them on mobile, if it advances my wow pets, and isnt just standalone
[8:26:23] Noshpan: @Jaina1337 Naw, there's a bunch of melee jobs that don't have representation in FFXIV yet. But I'm hoping for a Beast Master/Tamer, but that's most likely not going to happen if they don't want to deal with another pet job.
[8:26:26] L4dy_Renegade: I'd play the f out of battle pets on my phone while i'mwaiting for my sleeping pill to kick in. LUL

[8:28:07] Moronil: I love raiding in ffxiv
[8:28:14] Alaquane: another new job. melee dps. no details released
[8:28:20] L4dy_Renegade: Hydaelyn and Zodiark.
[8:28:22] yshtola1337: im glad they had yshtola super godly we needed that after the loss of so many lore characters
[8:28:26] Roffasauras: I'm kind of hoping for rune knight honestly
[8:28:38] Alaquane: Hydaelyn is that crystal that talks to you
[8:28:55] yshtola1337: i have her in my trust party all the time when doing/farming instances
[8:28:56] Noshpan: Hydaelyn is hte Mother Crystal.
[8:28:59] Alaquane: Every time you beat up a ifrit or titan of garuda, you got one of those little tiny colored crystals
[8:29:03] yshtola1337: thancred is such a good tank too
[8:29:09] dragothicx: Last character for today?
[8:29:22] Alaquane: Start of Heavensward taht dumb dragon cut off your connection to Hydaelyn
[8:29:33] Alaquane: Your special "Echo" power is tied to Hydaelyn
[8:29:37] Noshpan: Rune Knight would be awesome, but I see them more as a tank.
[8:29:39] dragothicx: Oh yeah, different server category I see
[8:29:46] yshtola1337: hopefully when all this covid thing is gone i can get to go to my first blizzcon
[8:29:47] Alaquane: It's the thing that gives everyone flashbacks
[8:29:51] MOLAR305: what about topgun

[8:30:41] Shrenko: towUnforte
[8:30:54] magnumcuda: 17 attempts and nothing here yet
[8:30:55] Noshpan: I think all the necromancer stuff Yoshida was teasing about during the showcase is just a red herring
[8:31:40] Shrenko: @Lifesource oh no only 17 :D
[8:31:40] RuineMi: midgardsomr
[8:31:51] CDubTheRIPper: holy crap

[8:32:08] Maroleb: they said spring; but not sure which month
[8:32:11] MOLAR305: they might be delaying with the shit going down over there
[8:32:17] Shrenko: probably gonna get delayed again
[8:32:21] magnumcuda: 17 today
[8:32:33] raldrik: they are like redoing crafting last I saw on newworld. Still closed alpha. My guess is that wont be out until fall
[8:32:40] magnumcuda: no idea how many in past years a lot
[8:32:46] branninjackson: so to get the mount you just gotta hope it drops from the Heart Shape Box?
[8:32:46] Noshpan: It was Midgardsormr that cut off the WoL's connection to Hydaelyn. But that was eventually restored in Heavensward. It's Nidhogg that you end up fighting twice in Heavensward. You do fight Midgardsormr in the Omega raids
[8:32:46] Masqerader: Resident Evil 8 is also in May so...no new world for me
[8:32:48] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm

[8:33:38] Alaquane: if you play it now, the next time they patch they'll delete your save
[8:33:50] Ishva: yeah BG3 in about a year
[8:34:37] MOLAR305: dps queues up to 15 mins now
[8:34:41] dragothicx: Age old argument but they should have made Divinity Original Sin 3 and not BG3 NotLikeThis
[8:34:44] Shrenko: I dont think you would like BG3
[8:34:47] Eithos87: I need one of those water juggs

[8:38:55] Roffasauras: gotta prolong that power
[8:38:55] Alaquane: prolonged power was super easy to craft
