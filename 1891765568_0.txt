[1:04:47] DosageGG: boring game when every group runs the same classes
[1:04:51] Tarosath: maybe warlock instead of mage
[1:04:51] sterlandd: Why is not Andy switching to Prot warr in that dungeon!?
[1:04:54] Fluffin04: @DosageGG ok
[1:04:57] bloddbear: Echo its time, kill the boss, no more deaths
[1:05:01] mcg55ss: @noble_ls imagine being such a blizz shill and fanboi you think a comp that had almost 90% of the keys past 25+ is balanced and good for the game
[1:05:08] blindsaplolz: @Rogastik Yeah for sure, this season if you dont play the Exodia comp, you probably dont get R1. But its not because you play fire mage you will time +29.  Most people dont do +25 ever
[1:05:08] lovelywaz: Imagine release a new Spec without testing that does blanket % buffs to every spec equally when stats and burst is hugely diff. What can go wrong? ... Just look at last three weeks!
[1:05:08] HeySpacecamp: Holy paladins are melee!
[1:05:09] brandonsleg: so for the finals after "god comp" nerf, we wont see any 30s being timed lmao
[1:05:12] HEADSHOZ_CS: why echos healer does so low damage??

[1:06:11] dembro: Well, BM is only good if mobs live for 2 mins which might happen in TGP PogChamp
[1:06:15] bloddbear: @HEADSHOZ_TV They are using deffensive trinkets instead of Offensive, which means lesser dmg compared to other groups
[1:06:20] GoGoGarrett: uh
[1:06:21] Chillcitysnipz: Fire still will be 200k more then the group for sure
[1:06:37] Vorqia: @dembro Bm is only good if it doesnt get one shoted with first mechanic XD
[1:06:39] Zirkx94: LOL
[1:06:41] sterlandd: Can someone more knowledgable than me explain why Andy keep playing Druid in that key, after two fails on last boss. Why not play prot warr that seemed to be the best spec for that specific boss?

[1:25:46] Entelligenz: @Sebleh Hey guys just wondering why I'm only seeing 5 of the possible 39 specs across all 4 teams. Are they required to play the specs? Or is it that the other 34 specs aren't competitive enough for these key levels? Thanks in advance.
[1:25:54] HeySpacecamp: Can the bear actually handle final NL boss?

[1:31:05] Yager05: @proteinloadedfart Technically not true
[1:31:08] blackmaija: is it possible that Echo does not make it to top2? it looked quite bad yesterday
[1:31:21] moderatygos: no team is out of it yet
[1:31:25] hokagejones: @proteinloadedfart last minute ran neltharus with a prot warrior for spell reflect but other than that yeah ;(
[1:31:27] WorgenDeath: @proteinloadedfart Wait untill you find out what the comps were in the previous 2 weekends
[1:31:36] Dreskor: @blackmaija they are literally on par with last minute bro
[1:31:37] Dassine: @blackmaija They'll make it, but more because Y and Sheesh have had some issues, not because they've been excelling
[1:31:44] Bloodbottler_88: @moderatygos Lies: All good and Sloth are out :-p
[1:31:45] Entelligenz: @blackmaija echo caught up today since other teams struggled aswell. they are even with last minute whenever their run is done
[1:31:51] kimohunt: @proteinloadedfart there was a Shaman XD
[1:31:54] hendryxe: I hope they nerf mage spriest and augmentation even more. this is ridiculous
[1:31:55] moderatygos: @Bloodbottler_88 true
[1:31:55] bloddbear: @blackmaija Naaaaah lol, Y still needs to time that 30 Underrot and 30 RLP for that to happen LUL
[1:32:01] Dassine: @Dreskor They're not. All their times are noticably worse. Last minute is playing much better
[1:32:15] VanishSHRoguE: @Entelligenz they caught up on time but not on tie breakers, they are losing atm
[1:32:24] Zel_Storm: why is it now showing Last minute underrot as World record
[1:32:29] VanishSHRoguE: @Entelligenz on points not time
[1:32:33] Entelligenz: @hendryxe this is not the nerfed version tho, since the patch is not live yet as you don't know
[1:32:38] cjayen: @hendryxe the nerfs are not even live
[1:32:54] Sarinilol: Y is looking good in that +29 brackenhide
[1:32:54] Entelligenz: @VanishSHRoguE the question was whether they can make top 3
[1:32:54] kimohunt: @blackmaija now Echo and Last Minute are top 2 (regardless of the scare since echo gonna pick up +24 after they finish this on) but everything is possible till midnight EU time
[1:32:55] hendryxe: I mean after the nerfs, on reset. nerf them again next week
[1:32:57] Dreskor: @Dassine their hoi is a lot better, their rlp is 7s worse, their ur is worse and the rest of the dungeons will be timed +1
[1:33:01] chamiero: rework elem
[1:33:09] Saiman48: dead game lul
[1:33:10] Sebleh: Y wasn't Y-ping NOTED

[1:33:22] Zenstudent: chat why are all teams running dps invoker?
[1:33:36] kimohunt: Andy dedge
[1:33:37] bloddbear: @proteinloadedfart Wait till you see the other 700000 TGP's and MDI's that have been, always the same comps, cause blizzard are not able to balance every spec and comp
[1:33:38] Sebleh: @Zenstudent It's a second healer actually
[1:33:44] Yager05: @Zenstudent Currently way too OP

[1:34:25] djthednadan: whn is MDI?
[1:34:29] Zel_Storm: +30 Underrot Last minute is world record - show that on leaderboard
[1:34:32] Thoticusses: Echo almost 30 points below 2nd place washed

[1:35:11] Bennodkk: yea 30 is doable for brechen hide
[1:35:22] SirStrikeofficial: Wait sanguine is slower than bolstering?
[1:35:24] moth43: @nufardetvaranog it is a dps! nothing targets it differently than a Dev Evoker, no dungeon interacts with it differently from the dungeon mechanics
[1:35:27] hendryxe: @IKoopz mind soothe, an OP utility spell that should be removed
[1:35:29] Dassine: @IKoopz Mind soothe + fade lets a priest open 5 without aggroing.

[1:36:13] qtsage: is there a casting schedule?
[1:36:20] nufardetvaranog: @moth43 its main function is to uphold ebon might as much as possible, which is only a buff not dps. it doesnt do much dps itself.
[1:36:25] bloddbear: Do we believe in 31 underrot?
[1:36:26] moderatygos: @qtsage not public, we rotate about every 45 minutes

[1:37:01] kimohunt: plink time?
[1:37:04] CritcakeEU: plonk
[1:37:06] quillshot2: I wonder if theres any merit to going ele shaman/disc priest for better totem killing on the 30 brackenhide
[1:37:08] QueentasticTDP: @hendryxe All shown specs rn gets nerf next reset
[1:37:11] jhonnyseismuertos: 1 raiders from jhonnyseismuertos have joined! 
[1:37:14] moltencrucible: @Xyronic we are voices too...
[1:37:17] Dassine: @Christgirl The issue isn't priest utility, most of which isn't new. The issue is the current dungeon design being perfect for that utility.
[1:37:24] hendryxe: @hendryxe not enough plink
[1:37:26] Zel_Storm: @Meeix why Last minute didn't get world record showed on leaderboard for underrot
[1:37:28] cvkarrosh: @quillshot2 are you trolling
[1:37:34] Matadoresbr: GO ECHO chevyi1LOVE chevyi1LOVE
[1:37:37] Dassine: @Dassine Mind soothe is super old, what's making it shine is the number of places you can suddenly use it, and can't use other options
[1:37:37] Sinaa: It's crazy how Echo's 30 RLP is only 7 seconds longer while having 5 deaths.
[1:37:43] QueentasticTDP: @moltencrucible Ghosts
[1:37:44] Mac_Twistnether: toadphMonkey  󠀀
[1:37:58] MierkaBlue: Let's Go Echo!
[1:38:09] Chr0nicConsumer: @Sinaa and being way, way slower at killing boss #2. They're wizards
[1:38:10] QueentasticTDP: @Meeix How is kittens?
[1:38:21] deathray5538: how much dps is 5 beacons?
[1:38:21] Meeix: @Yashkay we dont count time WR
[1:38:28] Bennodkk: lets face it Y or Sheesh wont complete a 30 ruby so last minute comes out as 1st seed and echo as 2nd 100% that's the case
[1:38:35] megadragon101: OWL2019DVa OWL2019Tracer
[1:38:37] lovelywaz: @Dassine But Mind Soothe was redesigned and now comes with AoE and that's a huge diff maker now
[1:38:49] CritcakeEU: @Dassine lots of mobs got truesight so invis/shroud is useless, but mind soothe still works
[1:38:54] QueentasticTDP: @Bennodkk Also think Echo holding back tacts n ect unless NEEDED
[1:39:04] hendryxe: they need to change mind soothe back to only one target instead of AOE. and make the CD longer
[1:39:06] Raikaria: I don't think anyone mentioned the RLP was a WR...
[1:39:09] Dassine: @lovelywaz It used to not have a CD, so not a huge different, really. Would be just as effective in HoI, Bracken, etc. Just a little bit more annoying to use
[1:39:10] jblinkx: fire too strong
[1:39:21] hendryxe: @jblinkx way too strong
[1:39:22] street_online: if blizz wasnt so *** on nerfs maybe the teams would have some variety
[1:39:27] Bennodkk: if Echo is holding anything back there's no need to show heree just take 2nd seed and save
[1:39:37] KissyChelle: @QueentasticTDP I agree.
[1:39:39] kimohunt: @Bennodkk pretty sure Echo lack of training cause Naowh's electric issue XD

[1:40:18] Ruzashu: Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[1:40:19] Christgirl: @aarseths They’re bad.
[1:40:19] xGriefxGodx: Hey guys back from my time out for a legitimate question, why are all of these teams playing the same composition?
[1:40:23] deathray5538: TL;DR fade = OP
[1:40:23] moltencrucible: @kimohunt as you could see in MDI finals against mandatory in Halls of valor, they are just not tryharding until very last moment when they need to push to win
[1:40:26] emilbilen: JUST DID BRACKEN 20 2 CHESTED AMA
[1:40:26] bloddbear: @street_online Never lol, they will never be able to make it so that there is not a perfect comp, that beats another comp, not until they make every class and spec the exact same lol
[1:40:29] ArnesMeyer: DinoDance DinoDance !!! SHEEESH !!! DinoDance DinoDance
[1:40:31] asayman: does Kirabear in Last Minute has Twitch streams?
[1:40:32] lovelywaz: @Dassine Having AoE Soothe a whole group, that would otherwise req  Shroud or Invis pots is much bigger diff than CD 🙄🙄
[1:40:33] xGriefxGodx: When can I expect to see a mistweaver on one of these teams?
[1:40:38] Emiliability: @clapityclapt i asked them to
[1:40:38] Bloodbottler_88: @aarseths Because they are still learning how to play the game?
[1:40:39] QueentasticTDP: @clapityclapt Bc best comp atm

[1:40:54] Mac_Twistnether: @clapityclapt toadphSmile
[1:40:56] QueentasticTDP: @clapityclapt Never
[1:40:57] Ruzashu: @clapityclapt It's the tournament rule to play the same comp so it is fair.
[1:41:03] street_online: @bloddbear like your part of the problem. to dumb to figure out balance. it is actually possible
[1:41:08] frriiedd: @bloddbear wrong go look at season 1
[1:41:09] LuciusLancer: Priest utility op, John Blizzard decided to nerf their damage instead. A+ balancing.
[1:41:17] Finaren_: @clapityclapt mby mby next xpac?
[1:41:22] blackmaija: shouldnt like class knowledge matter something? or are these classes so op that one can just jump to a new spec and still be better than on their "comfort" class?
[1:41:29] Vaiilz: @Meeix Priest too strong cuz of that ? LUL  lets have a look at what auvoker can do shall we Kappa
[1:41:30] Entelligenz: @clapityclapt you will see the best classes for timing the highest keys. because they are trying to time the highest keys.. get it?
[1:41:38] Meeix: @asayman @koloankira
[1:41:56] Ruzashu: @blackmaija No, Blizzard has made sure that these five specs are so op that it has become the tournament rule to play them plink
[1:42:15] Mac_Twistnether: @blackmaija second option toadphSmile

[1:42:56] QueentasticTDP: Lets face facts. If you ARENT pushing +25 keys on live this comp is as good as any other comp. Up to 25's its mostly how the player plays the spec.

[1:45:05] nimeon01: wait didnt the casters spent all of yesterday telling us y had no chance?  4Head
[1:45:05] El_Mandos: Tettles should be voice chat restricted because fake tuskarr news
[1:45:18] Zare_The_Sergal: Im surprised Rescue hasn't been nerfed to prevent mounts from being grabbed
[1:45:19] xGriefxGodx: @Entelligenz why can't the spec I enjoy (mistweaver) just be good enough to be seen on a competitive stage?
[1:45:33] Bennodkk: i think we should be nice to this grp and just send all 4 to global finals what do you guys say
[1:45:36] Kornukopian: @Zare_The_Sergal Or, to even dismount the rider, tbh.
[1:45:44] Bloodbottler_88: When will Dratnos be casting?

[1:46:05] Zare_The_Sergal: @Kornukopian This is definitely more reasonable
[1:46:07] ModeraYsera: timmy tuskar

[1:46:22] Entelligenz: @clapityclapt the important difference to understand here is that your spec (mistweaver) is competetive enough to time any of these keys on 1-2 levels lower. but that is not the highest possible key so thats why its not getting played.
[1:46:26] xGriefxGodx: @QueentasticTDP I didn't ask about live, I asked about the competitive stage.
[1:46:26] HeySpacecamp: Tim Tusk to his friends
[1:46:28] cornbreadcm: @clapityclapt it was in bfa i think
[1:46:49] QueentasticTDP: @clapityclapt Bc there are specs thats better.
[1:46:49] Vaiilz: Tuskarr Timmy
[1:46:52] LuciusLancer: @GamerDragonWoW twitch chat was wrong, and we don't remember the options anyway
[1:46:53] KissyChelle: @HeySpacecamp Tim THE Tusk to his enemies.
[1:46:54] whiskeyhide: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.
[1:46:58] frriiedd: mistweaver aint out here doing 28s dont lie to this man
[1:47:03] Finaren_: Meta is in every game ever in league you have 130+ champs and in competitive you see like 15 that Constantly rotate it is not wow thing when there is even 1% advantage in competitive you pick that
[1:47:08] Entelligenz: @clapityclapt and if you truly aspire to time the highest keys possible, then it kinda implies that you will be good enough to play any spec so it doesnt matter anymore
[1:47:14] mksmoke55: @GamerDragonWoW huipitat or whatever
[1:47:23] nimeon01: LuciusLancer twitch chat is always wrong and right there's always someone saying the right and wrong thing 4Head
[1:47:35] ToxicKnief: Why are the dungeons the same for each group? Wouldn't it be more fun if they were randomized? Just a thought
[1:47:42] Rogastik: @Entelligenz mistweaver is the worst example to use, MW is not doing 1 key level lower, there is only 1 MW in all of NA in title cut off range and rest of their comp is the god comp, if you pair mistweaver with off meta tank its doomed
[1:47:45] Meeix: @ToxicKnief they are randomized
[1:47:50] nimeon01: ToxicKnief nope not at all LUL
[1:47:55] El_Mandos: @tettles but What About The famous female tuskar singer?
[1:48:00] fearcxnt: HUH
[1:48:02] moderatygos: @ToxicKnief each group gets a different set of dungeons
[1:48:02] Entelligenz: @Rogastik that is a different problem
[1:48:04] nimeon01: Meeix hes asking different dungeons for each group
[1:48:06] Shearin77: yay dratnos <3
[1:48:13] R0NGG: are the nerfs on tourney realm??
[1:48:15] ChronycPain: Dr. Atnos!
[1:48:15] QueentasticTDP: There is one way to solve balance. Every spec will output SAME dps in AOE and ST and all specs have same HEALING and UTILITY. But then its gonna be boring to play.. No?
[1:48:16] Bloodbottler_88: DRATNOS has returned.
[1:48:17] Shearin77: HeyGuys
[1:48:17] Bennodkk: WHEN XYRONIC
[1:48:18] flywinget: DRATTY DADDY
[1:48:21] Meeix: @nimeon01 each group is having different dungeons. you mean every team?
[1:48:23] Parzha: ResidentSleeper this comb
[1:48:24] Xyronic: @Bennodkk :)
[1:48:26] moderatygos: if you're meaning each team competing this weekend, it needs to be fair across the board so they'd have to be the same keys
[1:48:31] street_online: if you play mistweave you might as well delete your character because its straight up dookie. just quit playing it
[1:48:34] lovelywaz: Mathnos! 👋👋
[1:48:35] Sebleh: seblehDinkdonk AWERT CHAT seblehDinkdonk MEEIX IS JOINING CHAT seblehDinkdonk BEHAVE OR SHE'LL GIVE YOU A MEAN LOOK AND DO really nothing probably tbh seblehNotes
[1:48:38] ToxicKnief: Oh I thought these were the same dungeons as group b?
[1:48:38] Entelligenz: @Rogastik or rather a different part of the big picture problem that is balancing in mmorpg's
[1:48:43] Meeix: @Sebleh truth
[1:48:44] Rogastik: @Entelligenz I will agree that usually meta comp is only 1-2 key levels above other comps, but not this season. God comp is just way too far ahead
[1:48:49] Knoxsteady: who allows dratnos to get on the desk and say 'welcome me'. is dratnos just built different
[1:48:50] nimeon01: Meeix like some people get infused other people get brackenhide thats what he is asking

[1:49:12] Zare_The_Sergal: @ToxicKnief Each group gets a different set each week, but some overlap since it still pulls from a pool of maps
[1:49:12] nimeon01: Meeix and not the other
[1:49:16] Entelligenz: @Rogastik yes, that is true.. but that doesnt change the fact that in tgp you will probably only see about 1-2 comps anyways
[1:49:22] Shearin77: @ToxicKnief they had freehols and didn't have neltharus
[1:49:28] QueentasticTDP: @Xyronic Fail LMAO
[1:49:34] Ascape: when will they switch out tettles?
[1:49:35] Meeix: @nimeon01 sorry im not sure i understand what youre saying. all teams in this weekends group have the same dungeons. Group A and B had different dungeons and different affixes
[1:49:38] djthednadan: how many teams left today?
[1:49:47] DaBo00: meow LM is doing so well this weekend
[1:49:51] KissyChelle: @djthednadan 4

[1:49:58] kimohunt: @djthednadan 4 left, and 2 will qualify for TGP global final
[1:50:02] mksmoke55: @Ascape why should they? tettles is great
[1:50:03] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[1:50:04] ToxicKnief: @Shearin77 Aahh thanks!
[1:50:05] Rogastik: @Entelligenz yeah TGP has always been same comp, I have 0 issues with that, my issue is with how big the gap between best comp and off meta comp is
[1:50:05] Entelligenz: @Rogastik afterall that is what people don't like about this... not that it impacts their gameplay in any way since they arent playing 29's anyways
[1:50:08] Meeix: @Nidalee55 its a trinket that does dam
[1:50:08] quarkoffel: Why is sheesh pulling more?
[1:50:13] SlayinSilver: @Nidalee55 its a trinket
[1:50:15] rathril: @Meeix think they're confused the other groups have different dungeons :)
[1:50:18] Finaren_: @nidalee55 trinket from last boss
[1:50:24] HeySpacecamp: Bacon from Beyond - trinket that does burst damage
[1:50:26] BobDaUnicorn: @mksmoke55 tettles and dratnos combo is goated
[1:50:30] KapWaller: anyone know standings for grp A and B?
[1:50:30] nimeon01: Meeix so, each team here has the same dungeons. Imagine if echo had different dungeons than sheesh. And they had to compete.
[1:50:34] kimohunt: @quarkoffel more rage for the bear,
[1:50:34] HeySpacecamp: And bacon is fun to say!
[1:50:41] Meeix: "Beacon To The Beyond" is the trinket name
[1:50:44] Xyronic: @nimeon01 that would be so unfair to the teams lol
[1:50:49] quarkoffel: @kimohunt i see
[1:50:52] QueentasticTDP: @nimeon01 That would make it unfair cause some dungs are easier than others
[1:50:52] bloddbear: @Nidalee55 Its a trinket from the new Raid, think its called Beacon of the Beyond, if you wanna look it up - Super trinket trinket
[1:50:53] Meeix: @nimeon01 that would be really not competitive lmao
[1:50:53] Nidalee55: ty
[1:51:02] ValdorWold: akshually im pretty sure its called bacon
[1:51:03] nimeon01: Xyronic exactly but that is what he asked
[1:51:05] ToxicKnief: @Meeix Yeah my bad! Thought they had the same, but i misremembered
[1:51:12] Chillcitysnipz: Yeah its from the last boss
[1:51:24] hendryxe: bear doing 300k, I see nothing absolutely wrong here - Blizzard
[1:51:24] kimohunt: @quarkoffel basically if there is adds that are not really dangerous, you should pull as a bear. give you more rage from trash XD
[1:51:27] Meeix: @Meeix ah there we go :) some dungeons of course are repeated eventually but usually with changing affixes
[1:51:46] ArnesMeyer: DinoDance DinoDance !!! SHEEESH !!! DinoDance DinoDance
[1:52:00] SakhetEU: Sheeesh is in such big trouble, they've spent so much time in NL only to do "just" a 29
[1:52:04] bloddbear: Would be funnier to see if you could "ban" some specs and see how that would go then - Like you can in WoW
[1:52:08] Premyer93: @Meeix Tyrannical Brackenhide when?
[1:52:10] Sebleh: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.
[1:52:14] kimohunt: Y in Hall of Infusion. lets go
[1:52:15] Meeix: @Premyer93 ill take it back to the council
[1:52:18] Vylens: @hendryxe threat is dmg based btw
[1:52:22] MercerTM: Do they have to supply their own keys or wow give them the key, just asking about the affixes
[1:52:22] Mac_Twistnether: @SakhetEU fix bugs
[1:52:23] bloddbear: If its six bans, you could ban all the tanks and see what would happen LUL
[1:52:27] Premyer93: @Premyer93 ty <3
[1:52:29] lowsry: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.
[1:52:38] Finaren_: Ye ban system for spec would be bis almost every game has that
[1:52:41] nimeon01: bloddbear LUL
[1:52:46] Rogastik: @hendryxe prot war can do that much dps too on big pull, Brew can do even more, Bear problem is they are super tanky and heal the group while doing good dmg
[1:52:50] Chillcitysnipz: @bloddbear doesn’t that take away from trying to push the highest keys?
[1:53:01] jirayia399: so all their evokers tend to run  inferno blessing over reactive hide for BH fortified.. Dont you guys think reactive hide outdamages Infernos Blessing? it does like 55m on Pug 24 keys for me
[1:53:10] Mac_Twistnether: thanerSH thanerEE thanerEE thanerSH anaisa1Love
[1:53:14] Meeix: Hey chat, for people who want NON-META competition, did you know theres a raider io event called break the meta thats doing these things? I didnt see you in their chat last time sooooo
[1:53:28] Mac_Twistnether: lmao
[1:53:31] bloddbear: @Chillcitysnipz I meeeeeeeeeeeeean true, but i just said "funnier", but i get you
[1:53:35] Chillcitysnipz: @meeix true that was fun
[1:53:37] Sebleh: @Meeix Are melee allowed?
[1:53:38] QueentasticTDP: @Meeix Take back to Counsil that for the Finals, every key should have the worst affix comp for each specific key. That be challenging and competetive
[1:53:49] SakhetEU: If you ban the 6 best specs you just get the 7-11 best specs for everyone. In a competition for the best of the best, you'll always get the best of the best comps. Whether they're 10% ahead or 1% ahead
[1:53:54] Bloodbottler_88: I'm breaking the meta every time I run live keys.
[1:54:00] frriiedd: @Meeix o.0 break the meta comps dont get title what are you on about
[1:54:10] Chillcitysnipz: @bloddbear that would be funny. Have blizz prank them by assigning them classes they nerf to the ground
[1:54:17] Meeix: @Meeix they even allow moonkins @Sebleh
[1:54:24] Finaren_: @sakheteu not true if you ban aug noone would play mage or priest
[1:54:28] moderatygos: nobody allows moonkins don't lie @Meeix
[1:54:30] straighttokes420: they ran last season live aswel
[1:54:31] YourWoWMoM: @Meeix totally did not know this but will def check it out!
[1:54:33] Meeix: @moderatygos lmao
[1:54:37] Sebleh: @Meeix Gross, moonkins, even worse than melee 🍃
[1:54:48] nimeon01: moderatygos ban Meeix for implying that NotLikeThis
[1:54:50] xGriefxGodx: Isn't it a problem that the "best" comps make it to broadcast and players in game mirror this demand even at keys 16-25 level? Since optimal at the top is optimal across the board?
[1:54:50] bloddbear: @SakhetEU We get 7/11? For free? PogBones
[1:54:50] ModeraYsera: bechkins are allowed, yes ...yesss baseg
[1:54:55] Meeix: @Meeix awesome!
[1:54:56] Rogastik: The worst part with nerfs coming, is that season is basically over. THe keys that have been timed on live cannot be beaten anymore
[1:54:56] Moobot: AWC schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/arena#schedule | MDI schedule: https://blizz.ly/MDISchedule
[1:55:20] Knoxsteady: is moonkin so cool to hate just because @tettles is really fun about it and a cool sport?
[1:55:20] QueentasticTDP: @bloddbear Idlike a coffee pls
[1:55:25] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: I have returned
[1:55:25] Zorkwins: @clapityclapt The information is still out there even if TGP doesn't happen
[1:55:26] jirayia399: @Meeix  so all their evokers tend to run  inferno blessing over reactive hide for BH fortified.. Dont you think reactive hide outdamages Infernos Blessing? it does like 55m on Pug 24 keys for me wich is wayyy more than infernos blessing
[1:55:28] KweenJubby: *doesnt notice Last Minute death*
[1:55:37] CritcakeEU: @bloddbear get me a coffee too, please
[1:55:41] 4301gway: how is this allowed?!?!?!? same comps
[1:55:46] xtimo_tv: @Rogastik do you know what comes with 10.7?

[1:56:04] ArrgTV: If they don't plan on running a BH+30, they should maybe rerun the key
[1:56:11] Cuddlymanbear93: KALI
[1:56:13] Bloodbottler_88: They should do a caster reference run on the first day. Like they should run a key before the event starts and then see how the competetion does it.

[1:58:28] jirayia399: @Meeix agreed and thanks for the answer was just wondering if i am missing anything about that talent.. maybe the whole challenge in this dungeon is totemdps and reactive hide does nothing to support this over the other talent.
[1:58:28] Tobo: plink
[1:58:28] Feinton: 30 BH seems way easier than 31 nelth
[1:58:28] kampfdodo: DinoDance
[1:58:32] Raikaria: LM might have a shot at 31 Underrot based on their performance yesterday
[1:58:34] nimeon01: Chillcitysnipz No pref just not mage/rogue/warrior being so far ahead of competition
[1:58:35] GamerDragonWoW: @HEADSHOZ_TV plonk
[1:58:36] Sebleh: Chat did you know that gutshot is most paaaainful way to die?
[1:58:36] Bloodbottler_88: @Axestro Yeah you are :-p
[1:58:39] WCPEllipsis: Psychic Link @HEADSHOZ_TV
[1:58:42] FoxxGhostboi: plink
[1:58:46] Crisette_: plink
[1:58:55] Dassine: @Feinton Problem is solely the totems on the last boss, imo
[1:58:59] ModeraYsera: @HEADSHOZ_TV its a blinking cat emote, you need the 7tv extension to see it
[1:59:05] Axestro: @bloodbottler_88 ty. <3
[1:59:07] TahviTV: @clapityclapt Broadcast is irrelevant. Going to *** causes it before TGP even starts.
[1:59:10] kibe_horde: Y had 2 minute split faster, because they did one big bark pull lessin that section, then add one pull in the last boss cave
[1:59:16] Meeix: @Meeix with bolstering in particular you definitely want more prio damage to make sure you dont bolster the high health targets up all the way
[1:59:19] Feinton: @Raikaria it is probably 4th on the prio list sadly, it would be possible with another 10 hours tho
[1:59:23] Premyer93: wideVIBE
[1:59:24] Chillcitysnipz: @nimeon01 very true. Priest being used in competition and being in main push groups is definitely nice to see for once
[1:59:25] WCPEllipsis: @jirayia399 Given how lenient the timer is even on a 29 as we've just seen that is my assumption as well.
[1:59:26] Ruzashu: I think windwalker should get a massdispel as melee class. Make it a windy-roundhousekick that dissipates all magic auras and melee comps will be viable again. (I am totally not a windwalker main btw)
[1:59:27] wesudesuu: I dont know why people use competitive scene to determine class balance. You guys arent doing 29-30 keys anyways.
[1:59:33] HEADSHOZ_CS: ok thanks
[1:59:40] Feinton: @Dassine yeah fair point, seems like as long as they can live it they got plenty of time
[1:59:47] moderatygos: the players are min maxxing because this is a competition and they want to win
[1:59:53] nimeon01: how many of the deaths of echo was gingi Kappa
[1:59:59] Entelligenz: @tsunariez this
[2:00:00] Moobot: Learn more about the new Augmentation Evoker spec: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23952478/specialize-with-the-new-augmentation-evoker

[2:00:24] itsmeerebuss: hey now u have to minus some from team sheeesh sinche there healer fell threw the map !!!!!!!!
[2:00:40] Sonyxpd: Echo had less time to practice since Naowh forgot to pay his bills
[2:00:49] nimeon01: @tsunariez I mean I understand your point but you can definitely feel the difference between bringing  a great class and a subpar class in m+
[2:01:09] Knoxsteady: @DrSonyx and 10 years of experience in the competitive scene
[2:01:20] bloddbear: @DrSonyx ICANT
[2:01:27] wesudesuu: @nimeon01 Which generally doesnt matter in average keys players are doing.
[2:01:30] Zare_The_Sergal: Has someone run the numbers on how much extra Aug Evoker is giving over a third dps?
[2:01:42] Chr0nicConsumer: enough to make these keys timeable
[2:01:46] HeySpacecamp: You notice the difference between players more than the differences between classes in pugs
[2:01:47] kampfdodo: @Zare_The_Sergal a lot
[2:01:50] WCPEllipsis: Statistically there is 3 times less representation for non top 5 specs above title range this season compared to last.
[2:01:58] Taylor131313: @Zare_The_Sergal it's not only dps, but also survivability and healing, which is why it's so good here
[2:02:03] DrWatt: @Zare_The_Sergal can look at logs.. its shows
[2:02:07] Chillcitysnipz: @luciuslancer you would have to take into account more classes just have defensives/dps/tankablity base on their toolkit. Would definitely need to add more defensives to other classes.
[2:02:17] casu_07: @Zare_The_Sergal if you go to a dmg meter website, aug is always at the top
[2:02:37] Axestro: @zare_the_sergal it's a combination of dps and defensive value combined with some tech enabling abilities.
[2:02:46] pantss1337: yo @vengence DH anyone of you have a good weakaura for tracking 4 pce?
[2:02:51] Literae: PogChamp Wonder what comp they will play in the finals......oh.... Kappa
[2:03:12] Zare_The_Sergal: Hmm that excites me more to get my hands on it when I eventually get the expansion and sub time
[2:03:26] buseereal: will changes affect tournament realm aswell?
[2:03:33] Korami__: @Literae since all the "meta" classes getting medium to big nerfs, I expect variety again
[2:03:38] Chillcitysnipz: @buseereal yes
[2:03:40] orcahontas: guardians are so far ahead its crazy , i cant even imagine doing those pulls as monk
[2:03:40] sanigawd: Is this nagura i hear as caster?
[2:03:41] Axestro: @literae it could change with the nerfs coming this reset
[2:03:49] nimeon01: tsunariez that's a bad faith argument. at a certain m+ everyone hits their limit, even bad players can raise that limit by playing stronger classes
[2:04:03] kampfdodo: @sanigawd yeah right now, for sure
[2:04:16] wesudesuu: @nimeon01 Disagree entirely.
[2:04:24] FoxxGhostboi: @sanigawd yea she just has a cold so her voice is a bit deeper
[2:04:27] Axestro: @sanigawd dratnuura actually.
[2:04:31] zi0heal: @nimeon01 a bad player is gonna be bad no matter what class they play
[2:04:35] moderatygos: its meeix, naguura is on vacation this weekend
[2:04:36] casu_07: on tourney realm can you pick ur gear layout or is it copy psated from live chaaracters?
[2:04:41] GrassAdmirer: Does anyone know how their gear selection worked? I notice Y's druid has a 441 trinket..
[2:04:43] Chr0nicConsumer: they can pick their gear
[2:04:53] seiyaastar: LM needs counts?
[2:04:55] nimeon01: Ardenwm but a bad player with a good class is better than a bad player with a bad class.
[2:04:56] Entelligenz: @nimeon01 maybe you can watch a guide then
[2:05:02] Chillcitysnipz: @casu_07 you can choose. There is vendors there that have all the gear
[2:05:02] Moobot: The Great Push Format Explainer: https://youtu.be/iSB2Oo5VIHE
[2:05:11] ModeraYsera: @casu_07 on TR you can pick what you want from a vendor
[2:05:17] nimeon01: Entelligenz 2/10
[2:05:27] officialbuddskii: @GrassAdmirer because the trinket dont go past 441 i think
[2:05:28] wesudesuu: @nimeon01 Youre coping alittle too hard here.
[2:05:33] Meeix: probably too long @LuciusLancer
[2:05:34] Entelligenz: @nimeon01 nice
[2:05:46] CritcakeEU: plink
[2:05:47] zi0heal: @nimeon01 i would still take a good player with a subpar class than a bad player on a good class
[2:05:55] casu_07: Can they practice on tourney realms or do they have to practice on live?
[2:06:06] Evohunt_tv: @casu_07 tourney
[2:06:12] Chillcitysnipz: @casu_07 they practice on tr realm
[2:06:14] cvkarrosh: @nimeon01 Sounds like you've never run pugs before then
[2:06:20] moderatygos: @casu_07 dungeons are locked for tgp so no
[2:06:24] Knoxsteady: @casu_07 they cant practice on TR during the TR, its locked during the weekend
[2:06:27] orcahontas: @CritcakeEU i was someone the other day ask if u were at cake what it would taste like, that made me laugh so hard irl xd
[2:06:28] lovelywaz: Echo gonna +2 this and then go for +31 BH 💪💪
[2:06:30] nimeon01: tsunariez you gave up arguing for your cause and started person attacks. EleGiggle
[2:06:32] FoxxGhostboi: Kappa dratnos
[2:06:35] Axestro: @moderaysera can they "myth" track upgrade gear? Or are all items 447 and up?
[2:06:35] Zare_The_Sergal: @Ardenwm I'm with Ard here, a good player can make a subpar class look really good but a bad player on a good class can show just how much of a skill gap there really is
[2:06:36] ModeraYsera: @casu_07 the dungeons are only open for the alotted time, so even if they practiced somewhere else it wouldnt be the same affixes, etc
[2:06:40] dzona9: Dratnos Jokes ICANT
[2:06:43] TheBagelsMan: <3 dratnos
[2:06:48] just_ok_viewer: last minute is struggling a bit

[2:07:24] plsdontbanmemen: did echo get ruby 30?
[2:07:27] GrassAdmirer: @officialbuddskii Y's spriest has a 447 spoils of neltharus which is m+ trinket as well tho?
[2:07:35] FoxxGhostboi: sheeeeeeesh
[2:07:37] Chillcitysnipz: @plsdontbanmemen yes
[2:07:37] nimeon01: cvkarrosh if you give a guy a car that has automatic gear and 1-100 in 4 seconds and the same guy a car without automatic and 1-100 in 10 seconds which car reaches the goal fastest?
[2:07:37] Oriforestx: One could say Last Minute killed the totem last minute. Get it? haHAA
[2:07:40] thanercountingmoney: Sheesh is fantastic, just needs to work on communication, routes, awareness, kicks, dispells, rotation, cd usage, defensives, tanking, prot warrior, hpal, clicking barrels in NL, safe spots, positioning
[2:07:40] Arsyle: What are these mod names? :D I love it!
[2:07:41] Xyronic: wtf
[2:07:42] moderatygos: @TwixxHD they can only practice on live if it matches, otherwise they are not allowed to practice. they don't know what dungeons they get until the first day of the tournament
[2:07:44] Xyronic: not old yeller

[2:07:59] sparklifegaming: old yellah! :o
[2:08:00] ifrel: why there is no replay?
[2:08:02] Axestro: So 447 unless it's from a late mythic raid boss?
[2:08:04] Acanologia: @GrassAdmirer the tank trinket is not from m+, its the new mega dungeon so only up to 441
[2:08:10] Sebleh: Sheesh is fantastic, just needs to work on communication, routes, awareness, kicks, dispells, rotation, cd usage, defensives, tanking, prot warrior, hpal, clicking barrels in NL, safe spots, positioning
[2:08:11] ToxicKnief: Sheeesh isn't looking great right now. Hopefully they'll have a comeback!
[2:08:13] Lonely_TTV: @GrassAdmirer the tanks trinket is from the new mega dungeon so it cant be in vault therefore no 447
[2:08:15] fivaldrood: @Sebleh  naguuraJAM
[2:08:25] Sebleh: Today my father asked me to clean his car for him and so I spent the whole morning doing it. After sometimes, I went back inside and my father asked me how was the car looking. “Wildi” I just replied. He just smiled and nodded. He knew that it was washed
[2:08:30] FICTIONEER58: so when is someone gonna disconnect on a boss fight? This isnt mythic game play with out disconnects cmon now
[2:08:37] Sebleh: @fivaldrood naguuraFeelsGood
[2:08:38] cvkarrosh: @nimeon01 You messaged the wrong person
[2:09:04] rollinnol: what addon do they use to show their key times/affixes on the left side ?
[2:09:12] GrassAdmirer: @Lonely_TTV Ohhhhh I didn't know that! I thought doti could appear in vault 447, but now that you mention it doti doesn't count towards great vault progress so that makes sense. Thank you
[2:09:24] nimeon01: @cvkarrosh Nah you made a comment that I never ran a pug and implied that the same pug person wouldn't be worse with a worse class hence my car point

[2:17:38] DaBo00: @MrRox1337 boo RPGGhosto
[2:17:38] Christgirl: @zugarstwitch Oh, yeah. Let’s just gut priest even more by giving the only utility they have to other classes.
[2:17:46] Randizz: @Faxii they buff all others dmg so some of the other dps's dps is there in some sence
[2:17:58] MrRox1337: @DaBo00 hehe xd :3
[2:18:00] Emiliability: kungen already timed 31 RLP, the only reason LM's run is marked as world record is because he skipped 30
[2:18:02] ZugarsTwitch: @Christgirl The only class that can do MD + soothe must be broken apart lol
[2:18:05] Zare_The_Sergal: I haven't played M+ in 5 years how much time does a death steal from the timer these days?
[2:18:14] thunderioum: @Zare_The_Sergal 5 sec
[2:18:23] moderatygos: @Zare_The_Sergal 5 seconds
[2:18:26] Chillcitysnipz: @emiliability facts lmao
[2:18:37] Chillcitysnipz: @zare_the_sergal 5 seconds
[2:18:56] Faxii: @Randizz Thank you! I havent played for a few years but do follow the m+ sometimes, it just looked strange to be that a dps was doing healer dps :)
[2:19:02] DaBo00: one 60th of a set of 5min
[2:19:13] Zorgggg: its a buff it couldn't be easier to track
[2:19:22] textio545: @Faxii  he is more op than details show
[2:19:25] deathray5538: i never go get that thing when i run HOI due to the short cut
[2:19:25] Zare_The_Sergal: @Faxii Healer numbers get inflated just slightly as well
[2:19:32] ChronycPain: Remove PI or make it purely personal. Stop putting mobs/ abilites in dungeons that require mass dispell and mind soothe. Nerfing Priest and mage damage isnt gonna nerf this comp in any way
[2:19:36] zerocoolx: ***
[2:19:47] fraser_g: @ChronycPain BabyRage
[2:19:52] rollinnol: wait say that again about last boss of HOI? had adds the other day didnt know where they came from
[2:19:57] zerocoolx: @Meeix ***
[2:19:59] deathray5538: and its a dont die thing, and its like, well, why would you die to begin with ugh lol

[2:20:12] lovelicious1: Congrats last minute Win TGP Season 2
[2:20:13] Randizz: @Faxii yeah it was strange in the start then we saw how much they did for the team without that evo they would not be able to do this high key's
[2:20:26] zerocoolx: @ModeraYsera ETA GG

[2:20:42] Christgirl: All these people complaining about priest don’t remember that priest got gutted and has been terrible for several xpacs now.
[2:20:47] rathril: good luck last minute
[2:20:56] Thomas_Huayra: monkaS
[2:20:57] kimohunt: lets gooo LM
[2:20:59] TrainedTiger: Last Minute is going to win the whole TGP
[2:21:04] Klaasieman: LETSS GOOOO Pog
[2:21:08] Chillcitysnipz: @christgirl literally never seen them in competition
[2:21:09] Redf0xx: jeez 31....
[2:21:12] krya4ka: so big LM =)
[2:21:20] ZugarsTwitch: @Christgirl If you leave priest the only class with EITHER soothe OR MD it's still OP
[2:21:33] sm1rks: shoutout to the top dps of the dungeon, neltharus weapons
[2:21:33] mika01: naguuraJAM
[2:21:35] DaBo00: meow let's go LM
[2:21:36] cvkarrosh: Chains did 3 fire mages worth of dps wow
[2:21:44] moltencrucible: @TrainedTiger we are overreacting a bit here
[2:21:47] khalid_ce92: this is pog
[2:21:50] textio545: @zugarstwitch  no, in wow utility is no matter count only dps
[2:22:03] TrainedTiger: LFM +4 Underrot, 445+ Link me Cutting Edge for invite
[2:22:09] Zizida: shannox too in firelands
[2:22:12] ZugarsTwitch: @textio545 Jebaited
[2:22:12] anmaal: also one for shannox in firelands for dragging them around
[2:22:17] DaBo00: @TrainedTiger to my eyes, LM has been the cleanest team we've seen yet. But anything can happen in the finals
[2:22:20] Christgirl: @zugarstwitch They have no knock back or interrupt. Every other spec in the game has one or the other. Priest utility was gutted for Dragonlands and still, has the least amount of defensives of any other class.
[2:22:22] melkisel: Mythic+ are hard
[2:22:22] Zare_The_Sergal: Neltharus Weapons too OP Blizzard pls nerf KappaPride
[2:22:25] shmmeker: last minute dominating
[2:22:26] 1tast: why do you drag lohar
[2:22:35] thunderioum: @TrainedTiger Aug / druid prio inv !
[2:22:41] ChronycPain: @textio545 you're just wrong
[2:22:46] sm1rks: watch the mage
[2:22:58] khalid_ce92: lets see 31+ come on
[2:23:00] Cendei: @Christgirl u calling sp a bad spec rn? lmao
[2:23:11] Thomas_Huayra: WoW is the most utility emphasized mmo I've played, so...
[2:23:14] brotan123: that lust just magically came back
[2:23:29] textio545: @ChronycPain  no if i be. comp not be the same in every group
[2:23:33] ZugarsTwitch: He/she is just baiting
[2:23:37] VenoTV1: Echo +2?
[2:23:46] Dorky1495: @Christgirl I guess Mass Dispel, PI aint enough for priests?
[2:23:48] Christgirl: @cendei No. I’m saying it’d really good right now and it deserves it because every priest spec has been bad for years. 3 expansions at least.
[2:23:57] Dassine: @Christgirl The thing is that the utility Priest has is unique. You can replace a lack of interrupts/etc with other specs. Same for defensives. Same for raw dps/hps. You can't replace Mass Dispell, Mind Soothe, or Dominate Mind. Not really.
[2:24:16] MindhackerTV: 20%
[2:24:19] shmmeker: 31 Neltharus damn son
[2:24:20] kazbegaming: @Christgirl someoine forgot shadowlands holy meta
[2:24:21] apbrinks: @Christgirl WHAT? holy priest was triple s tier in shadowlands s3 and s4
[2:24:26] potatoehead929292: why almost no NA teams? NA peeps bad at PVE?
[2:24:27] TrainedTiger: They should give Shadow Priest a Taunt and an immunity too
[2:24:30] Delliewelli: dominate mind needs a nerf, need a hpriest main to dominate me asap
[2:24:34] Arauthor: i haven't been able to watch much this weekend, is Last Minute just playing better than Echo?
[2:24:34] Entelligenz: @Christgirl except for all the times when holy or disc was extremely good in raid
[2:24:34] ZugarsTwitch: And there are people that think that MD+soothe+MC belonging to one class is fine lol
[2:24:41] sleepy_wookiee: How long does tgp go today?
[2:24:50] Entelligenz: @Christgirl or when holy way extremely good in SL keys
[2:24:50] Dassine: @Arauthor Yes
[2:25:02] MrRox1337: Guys did Last Minute set a World Record in RLP? That's so insane!
[2:25:05] Milano___: @sleepy_wookiee About 3 more hours, I think
[2:25:06] whathappensbilly: @potatoehead929292 Isnt like 70% of wow players based in EU or smt
[2:25:06] Chillcitysnipz: @apbrinks they never were used at worlds first keys. Tgp didn’t use them either. Did see them at 28-29 though
[2:25:07] TrainedTiger: They should give SP a spammable groupwide run speed boost too
[2:25:08] DaBo00: @sleepy_wookiee 3 more hours until they lock the current runs they'll be in
[2:25:11] Zorgggg: buff blood dk
[2:25:12] ChronycPain: @textio545 you are wrong. You are assuming they are running this comp for pure dps which they are not. SP is brought for utility. PI, Mass Dispell, Mind Soothe
[2:25:14] Noflameofc1: what is going on here why is there 3 different dungeons?
[2:25:16] Thomas_Huayra: Holy was good for a specific portion at the end of SL, Holy was nowhere in the 1st two seasons
[2:25:18] Arauthor: damn that's insanely impressive @Dassine
[2:25:24] sm1rks: This trash doesn't do much so big pulls make sense
[2:25:29] MindhackerTV: nailed it 20% xD
[2:25:29] Moobot: AWC schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/arena#schedule | MDI schedule: https://blizz.ly/MDISchedule
[2:25:31] CherylK1972: No B Rez option for Last Minute in here? It looks greyed out. =O
[2:25:41] Chillcitysnipz: Shadow holy did have finally something
[2:25:44] deathray5538: @Noflameofc1 cuz there is 4 seperate teams running a key each
[2:25:46] zardra90: maybe skip the problematic mini bosss later
[2:25:54] Dassine: @Arauthor Yeah, Echo had a really week day 2 setting them behind. And LM have just been killing it, in general
[2:25:55] TrainedTiger: Engineering rez
[2:26:00] baalzemon: Is Y going to fail the key?
[2:26:01] cvkarrosh: Jeus
[2:26:10] DaBo00: @baalzemon they should be fine
[2:26:16] Thomas_Huayra: pls give us Mistweaver meta, Blizz.
[2:26:17] xGriefxGodx: Hey guys I've watched the last two broadcasts and haven't seen a mistweaver. Why is the spec that I play not competitive on a world stage?
[2:26:18] Bennodkk: Why is Kira using that bad bear skin werebear ftw
[2:26:24] CherylK1972: That was strange looking lol
[2:26:33] Vorqia: @clapityclapt its bad in keys
[2:26:34] DaBo00: l hope gc7Bless !
[2:26:35] HeySpacecamp: Elephant takes time to warm up to full power though
[2:26:43] Chillcitysnipz: @trainedtiger they need to add those again. I hate the tinker item one
[2:26:44] Vorqia: on highest lvl
[2:26:51] Ezimoooo: nice
[2:26:52] Ashine: nice
[2:26:58] TheBiggestManOnCampus: nice
[2:27:05] hightestjesus: Is it top 2 that ualify?
[2:27:06] Gelatimentah: lack of utility / lower hps and dps than the Hpal
[2:27:56] khalid_ce92: are u jking lets see 31+ then talk about the route man
[2:27:56] PaulxD: is this a dratnos route
[2:28:21] Zare_The_Sergal: These pull maps make zero sense...
[2:28:27] MrRox1337: @PaulxD any route is a Dr. Atnos route if you believe in it!
[2:28:28] rollinnol: where do adds come from on last boss of Halls of Infusion?
[2:28:34] TrainedTiger: All the groups have monks in them, thay are just out of range all the time
[2:28:38] cvkarrosh: @Zare_The_Sergal Are you just unable to read them?
[2:29:02] Dorky1495: 31 neltharus would be a WR right?
[2:29:04] moderatygos: you guys need to be nice to each other
[2:29:07] shmmeker: if they get the 31 its gg wp
[2:29:08] Altug_II: crazy pull from last minute
[2:29:10] cvkarrosh: Nobody wants a pug MW in a 25, it doesn't even make sense to take one
[2:29:18] khalid_ce92: @Dorky1495 ya
[2:29:21] Schnudelie: it doesnt look like that echo is safe safe this time. thats quite nice
[2:29:21] voyage_icarus: Woah 31. Insane
[2:29:23] Lepan: id jpcs team already out?
[2:29:35] Zare_The_Sergal: @cvkarrosh Havent played in five years, this wasn't an analytic back when I pushed keys. and I dont know any SL/DF dungeons so the map in general doesn't make sense either
[2:29:38] Rogastik: @proteinloadedfart its not cause Echo looking fast enough to do 30 HoI and 30 Brackenhide
[2:29:44] voyage_icarus: Is WR = world record?
[2:29:49] moderatygos: @voyage_icarus yes
[2:29:52] Chillcitysnipz: Pretty sure jpc team was first place last week
[2:30:03] voyage_icarus: 👍

[3:57:36] TrainedTiger: Gutshot melted
[3:57:51] shmmeker: LM might try 31 BH
[3:57:59] headlocks000: @Zazamat both of those are just fine for your weekly keys, dont be fooled by the meta
[3:58:00] sweetpros: is prot pally good in dragonflight?
[3:58:03] GnoxEU: bro :D too easy :D wtf
[3:58:07] Hregoth: they need 2mins to bring boss hp to 50%
[3:58:20] MrRox1337: @proteinloadedfart I think 31 BH is not possible. Totem on last boss in near unkillable already on 30
[3:58:26] ModeraYsera: @HooliganJack Если вам нужны русские субтитры, они доступны на нашем YouTube-канале.
[3:58:26] Chillcitysnipz: @sweetpros yeah all tanks are pretty good rn
[3:58:27] Raikaria: a +30 is multiple times harder than +20 ect. Each key level multiplies o the prior
[3:58:36] FarvaWW: Why isn't Echo playing anymore?
[3:58:42] MrRox1337: echo 10 min break

[3:58:58] TrainedTiger: LM is going to be like 31:30...
[3:59:03] shmmeker: @MrRox1337 yea only problem is the totem indeed beacons would solve that problem maybe

[4:01:34] rafael_mullerr: Have you guys talking about thaner already made RUbi 30? kisses of light

[4:01:38] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/TGPS2_GroupC
[4:01:39] Raikaria: @NashMarco when the patch happens. But even then, you'll still have them playing a "the same comp". They're pushing WR level; if there is a best comp they will play it
[4:01:40] Dendii7: blazing Pog
[4:01:46] oldchickenqq: щищ

[4:02:48] Thomas_Huayra: Is Echo saving strats or just... vulnerable?
[4:02:52] Mirculix: @wexixd everyone saw what echo did so they learned from it
[4:02:53] elidaise: WR?
[4:02:53] kimohunt: Just imagine Echo out in group stage. This TGP is FIRE
[4:02:57] MrRox1337: sheeesh with the 0 death run in a 30 RLP. That's in itself insane!!!
[4:02:57] LGhost: sheesh have a good chance of timing BH too, I think echo needs to get out of Neltharus if this run fails
[4:02:58] tondk123: echo choking
[4:03:02] onemanaleft: echo no WRs
[4:03:04] apbrinks: SHEEEEEEEESH LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:03:13] dzona9: Sheesh played Season 1 and were rank 1 so expected
[4:03:14] OzTnj: why this grp is stacked
[4:03:14] Hermganksyou: @Thomas_Huayra vulnerable. why would they save stats in a tourny lol
[4:03:15] kimohunt: Excavate Tettles KEKW
[4:03:16] tinywulf: LUL tettles
[4:03:21] TrainedTiger: Echo is too proud to protect their 2nd place spot, they will live or die trying to win
[4:03:21] Hastif: all of them
[4:03:22] Altug_II: echo may have to improve their time in a 30/29 if they struggle on the nelth
[4:03:28] greenmachine11235: Echo really hasn't gotten better while everyone else has
[4:03:38] MrRox1337: Guys I'm being honest, LM looks kinda stressful rn. Thoughts?
[4:03:41] Schnudelie: Sheeesh could do the 30 BH in a better time
[4:03:44] Raikaria: Move the WR off LM
[4:03:45] nerthock: th chicken man is back
[4:03:47] Hastif: speed hates it
[4:03:51] Sathyron: @LGhost why would echo get out of Nelth? Thats the only dungeon that makes sense for them
[4:03:57] ZugarsTwitch: Only really high rio players, like above 2200 rio, should comment on TGP strategies
[4:03:57] Chillcitysnipz: Echo did miss almost a week of practice due to naowh power going out
[4:04:01] MrRox1337: how long is last boss on 30 BH?
[4:04:02] moderatygos: i think echo knows exactly what they need to do, all of these teams have a good understanding of what they need to focus on in this last hour 15
[4:04:02] Max_Hollow: pretty sure they go BH
[4:04:11] DeadlyFog_tv: wow is dead boys
[4:04:13] kimohunt: @MrRox1337 they are pretty chilling with the +31 done. so they have 1hour + to do this BH. i dont think they are stressful XD
[4:04:13] rasolTTV: sheesh has WF Fix it pls
[4:04:30] ZackLimp: Give the SHEEESH boys their WR
[4:04:30] MrRox1337: @kimohunt oh I mean this specific key. I hope htey time it!!!
[4:04:31] Fajalah: Echo will still win this year after the nerf to this god comp is applied
[4:04:33] FarvaWW: @DeadlyFog_tv 15k is actually pretty high for tgp idk what u are talking about
[4:04:34] Schnudelie: rasolTTV you mean WR
[4:04:36] james26m: i think echo is actually gonna be out
[4:04:41] LGhost: @Sathyron because sheesh can steal 2nd based on timers, it's easier to get better times than progressing a dungeon from scratch
[4:04:43] DingoWango: soo much class variety
[4:04:51] PengoOoO: when is kungens team playing with athene and swifty?
[4:04:52] rasolTTV: @Schnudelie ++ sry
[4:04:53] kimohunt: @rasolTTV which WF? WF is dungeon done, not about how fast they do it.
[4:05:02] rasolTTV: @rasolTTV I meant WR chill xD
[4:05:03] daasdingo: admins, pls fix WR on RLP, sheesh is first!
[4:05:06] shmmeker: @golbeza yea wow has been dead for the last 15 years dude LUL
[4:05:10] Raikaria: if Eccho can't do 31 Nel and Sheesh get a good 30 Braken they can take 2nd
[4:05:10] DaBo00: meow Let's go Last Minute
[4:05:12] Hermganksyou: @DingoWango going for world records, why would there be variety?
[4:05:14] elidaise: goLM
[4:05:15] rasolTTV: I'm tanking a dung at the same time 󠀀
[4:05:26] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: Come on Last Minute vibee
[4:05:27] Symadh: ay did the rogue thing
[4:05:31] kimohunt: @rasolTTV even WR XD LM did +30 first so they got the WR. its not about time. just who did that dungeon first
[4:05:34] yozys: How Long time do they have left?
[4:05:34] Raikaria: @rasolTTV it's World Record not World First
[4:05:34] moohuu: that was a close call :D
[4:05:36] Tmyws: Sy
[4:05:40] Melgorm: He was not in the arena. Not meleed :)
[4:05:41] Fajalah: @Raikaria Time has nothing to do with TGP score
[4:05:41] Nnoggie: its probably for ret aura
[4:05:43] Chillcitysnipz: Echo brekenhide was insanely good with barely any deaths will be hard to beat
[4:05:49] rasolTTV: @rasolTTV it was a typo :(
[4:05:50] TrainedTiger: Echo could lock their 2nd place with faster timers, but they are going to try for the +31 to win and it might cost them the spot in the finals
[4:05:51] Tmyws: @Symadh SYMADH-DRAENOR? THE GUY
[4:05:52] cvkarrosh: @rasolTTV World first and world record aren't the same thing
[4:05:59] Reydien: if SHEESH matches ECHO's time in BH they'll be 1:31 behind on time tiebreaker. they either need to do Nelth 31 or find a minute and a half of time savings
[4:06:00] MrRox1337: @Nnoggie oh that is such an INSANE tech!!!
[4:06:03] Symadh: @Tmyws real Tmy?
[4:06:13] rasolTTV: @rasolTTV I meant WR MB ^^
[4:06:18] Raikaria: @Raikaria If Echo can't do their 31 and Sheesh takes 30 Braken Echo she Sheesh are tied on all keys; so it goes to time
[4:06:19] insaner_g: why is the reason of nerf exodia comp at this point? no one wants a markmanship hunter even with buffs u just complicated the push for those who wanna get title of season
[4:06:25] Aneas: @TrainedTiger you think?
[4:06:46] cvkarrosh: @insaner_g Title is completely irrelevant this season anyways

[4:07:33] 123Sepi123: is hpalas the m+ spec on wowhead? or more advanced stuff
[4:07:37] Reydien: oh my bad, sheesh would only be 29 seconds behind if they match echo's BH-30 time.  that's more doable, but still an advantage for Echo atm

[4:08:21] TrainedTiger: I dont think so Tettles, if they knew they could live it they would just kill it with cleave by the second cast and focus boss, they were trying to beat it

[4:10:10] SebastianMelmoth1854: @avraan93 augmentation evoker is insanely good in terms of utility and amps the damage of your big damage dealers anyway; it's equal in dps output to other classes while bringing significantly more utility than anyone else can
[4:10:12] james26m: @PengoOoO if sheesh times brackenhide with 2 seconds faster then echo they are 2nd

[4:47:04] SebastianMelmoth1854: it's a pretty substantial difference, it's over 3 minutes for Lm

[4:53:19] Nytrand: Man I miss Legion  Sacro legedary, just pull all and kite
[4:53:21] Meeix: @Rangerbob1921 its very unlikely for echo to finish in 2nd place, hence the foxus on it
[4:53:22] LeYogi91: so funny to watch that variaton of classes
[4:53:32] Goliathse: @DoctorDel1cious Indeed, i think lots of people dont think about that at all.. The amount of focus required are insane
[4:53:32] XicoreWoW: why is echo doing that 29 didnt they already time it?
[4:53:32] ChronycPain: @Altug_II yes but they missed count and had to spend 50 seconds killing one more add
[4:53:35] MrRox1337: Chat how does one qualify for "Global Finals"?
[4:53:39] Altug_II: Echo are not NL30 believers
[4:53:40] kimohunt: @inknik not really, if LM didnt time and Echo do it fast enough, they might get 1st. its not hardlock yet but really hard to do XD
[4:53:51] cvkarrosh: @XicoreWoW Don't think they can 30, so they're trying to win tie breaker for 29 by timing it faster
[4:53:53] Acrono187: echo might be saving alot of skips for globals
[4:53:56] Nytrand: @XicoreWoW for better timing i guess
[4:54:00] SpookyScarySkellie: @Meeix What kind of pizza are we talking GivePLZ
[4:54:00] ironmade: eu cant win all the time... NA shall win some times
[4:54:03] LGhost: Echo doing the 29 is honestly the smartest play if going for first too. 30 NL is really really hard
[4:54:03] Altug_II: ChronycPain oh so time not that great I guess

[4:55:33] SpookyScarySkellie: @Meeix Looks delicious, missing some pineapple on there though
[4:55:34] odawgxd: @Goliathse I think they have to call the last run before 00:00 to be able to start it
[4:55:36] Meeix: as good as frozen pizza can be yea
[4:55:37] XicoreWoW: @marqsph World Record

[4:56:01] EzzLyfe: @Meeix when was the last time you ate pizza tho, be honest
[4:56:08] kimohunt: @bingwl 29, to improve time
[4:56:11] Meeix: @Meeix last weekend i think..
[4:56:11] moderatygos: echo i think is looking to improve the 29 time
[4:56:15] Fluffin04: @bingwl prolly to do 2 dungeons instead of 1
[4:56:24] Meeix: i often eat like frozen food when im working cause i dont have much time lol
[4:56:27] Dysloks: Why echo is on 29 lair again ? They want to improve time ? Instead of running 30
[4:56:28] james26m: echo had the 1% ularogg go down in there 29

[4:58:48] toshimoto90: wait why is echo playing NL 29 again?
[4:58:58] LGhost: If LM get this 30 NL then they're just beyond dominant and would be my favorite to win the finals
[4:59:00] bebincalicious: LuL
[4:59:00] shmmeker: @Meeix are you believe in voodooism
[4:59:00] TrainedTiger: That is probably a decision for an extra Defensive on the first pull
[4:59:02] EzzLyfe: ye Naraxas eating is only a tank problem

[5:01:39] SuveraLive: plink
[5:01:58] Meeix: @sulozor i think so, it always moves them even safer into second spot against sheesh
[5:02:03] rowleyjohnuk: U can tank boss from behind on the worm and not get the pull strings!
[5:02:08] user_42107: @Meeix can we add for future TGP events, an actual timer on screen, for time left

[5:30:44] hands0mme: Why Echo and Last MInute have the same score if Encho get 30 Neltharion L?
[5:30:45] LGhost: Is 28% enough to finish ularogg in the next phase, they did 39% with lust
