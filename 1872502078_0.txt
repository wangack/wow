[1:06:40] Brovakiin710: There is a metric butt ton of stuff in PoE at end game
[1:06:43] Techziqoo: i'm sorry i have never even played PoE but that is just wrong brother
[1:06:43] Brovakiin710: outside of maps
[1:06:44] Necrom93: That was a... take
[1:06:53] SpilledMelk: Open world felt like running from maps to maps.
[1:06:53] Alepouditsa: yea nothing to do in poe end game danKappa
[1:06:59] xchaoskingsx: new character?

[1:07:19] Gingerprimer: @xchaoskingsx yeah that you have to make a new character for the season
[1:07:23] Brodih_: youre gonna get it on poe reddit soon
[1:07:26] zeiours: Exile con is soon too, hopefully a poe 2 date
[1:07:38] Techziqoo: diablo 4 got more potential for sure but it's gonna take A LOT of seasons
[1:07:48] Colt_Engineer: man, so many players for a dead game LUL
[1:07:54] xchaoskingsx: @Gingerprimer Oh, thought he meant they announced a new character
[1:07:55] DunzoCD: PoE and Diable fans are so tribal LUL
[1:08:10] Molvonos: @Towelliee https://i.imgur.com/vLtmBDx.jpg
[1:08:12] Gingerprimer: POE might have the worst desingned Learning curve about what to do/how to do it I have ever seen in game
[1:08:38] Techziqoo: people are also comparing PoE to Diablo 4 when PoE has existed for 10+ years and Diablo 4 is brand new
[1:08:38] zeiours: I feel like Diablo and PoE is like dots and league players
[1:08:47] Nokterian: KEKW
[1:08:48] snuffles_80: and D4 just came out
[1:08:53] shale93: they expected content of new expansion or some shit KEKW
[1:08:55] Colt_Engineer: Diablo 4 had the best launch for a blizzard game that I've scene in years
[1:08:56] TheItalianStallion321: yes PoE is a real bad learning curve. they set you up for failure if you are new
[1:09:03] Sarocus: People who didnt know decided to speak instead of listen.
[1:09:12] Colt_Engineer: seen
[1:09:23] Techziqoo: ???
[1:09:30] Nokterian: PoE is like Eve Online
[1:09:34] Brovakiin710: Its quite the opposite PoE devs are d2 players
[1:09:37] Nokterian: a steep learning curve
[1:09:38] ArkusTV: What are you drinking @Towelliee
[1:09:44] Techziqoo: can u explain what i said was a troll?

[1:10:11] Techziqoo: i never said diablo franchise i said Diablo 4
[1:10:19] Brodih_: hes talking about the content at release in D4
[1:10:25] Techziqoo: Diablo 4 is wayyy older than PoE ofcourse
[1:10:26] Nokterian: Around the same time
[1:10:31] xchaoskingsx: PoE is fun but its a lot for some people, if you aren't a hardcore gaming, PoE isnt really for you. The skill tree scares a lot of people off.
[1:10:42] Techziqoo: You got it wrong xd
[1:10:57] Techziqoo: PoE has added content to the game for 10+ years. where would D4 be if they added content for 10+ years?

[2:10:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I think WoD is when its not like classic
[2:10:49] Syllvn: We will not get a world revamp, they might touch the odd zone slowly but they want to give us new stuff
[2:11:07] PvtHudson093: Was it Knaifu or Ashara?

[5:24:47] Hammerify: really?
[5:25:07] Phantomstrk: that's what their customer service said when i asked on the website
[5:25:45] karaste: Typically, the power load of the motor that moves the desk is too much of a potential draw to safely plug the desk into a UPS
[5:25:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: check if it wobbles
[5:25:58] TheItalianStallion321: probably make your own presets

[6:30:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: test your pc so i dont break mine LUL
[6:30:08] ShadowPoet: That would scare me, my PC hanging there

[6:30:33] kostchie: Annie has one on both sides

[6:31:26] ShadowPoet: I guess that's not so bad with the bar under it

[6:32:34] DrKaren8: I like that it's out of the way. Pretty nifty system.
[6:32:49] Aidler: it naturally would have to hold some of the weight that is trying to move to the side but that shouldn‚Äôt be enough to endanger the case
[6:32:55] EKS90_: standing is nice if you use controller for some game or just for browsing, good for your legs and bloodflow
[6:32:59] zoovthepally: i use this like $14 dollar little stand off of amazon that has wheels and keeps my pc like 4 inches off the ground
