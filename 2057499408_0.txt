[1:57:15] FateIRL: im the same way about maplesotry. was my first mmo tons of nostalgia
[1:57:21] Lansstuss: true
[1:57:21] blizeontv: Right you started in cata
[1:57:26] Mr_Recons: id say the dungeons are a hell of alot better in retail
[1:57:42] Lansstuss: my Wrath gaming is purely carried by nostalgia, I love it and I play it coz it reminds me of my teen years and raiding icc
[1:57:52] Lansstuss: but I'm not delulu to not know that retail is better game
[1:58:00] blizeontv: People shouldnt get mad about baby-wow it literally is
[1:58:07] Coolburnn: i think in addiiton to nostiglia classic for sure has its own feel but its very different from retail
[1:58:12] Coolburnn: yeah exactly they dont care about end game
[1:58:26] blizeontv: wow was an experiment by Blizzard to make an mmo
[1:58:28] Mr_Recons: excited about cata?
[1:58:33] Coolburnn: or care less rather i mean
[1:58:52] bigboyblix: retail wow has progressed graphics and gameplay wise and completely digressed social/rpg/soul wise
[1:59:01] Lansstuss: I'd sooner compare Heroic+ to Nightmare dungeons since you get affixes that buff you
[1:59:07] Quaylin: Hit you up in discord
[1:59:07] Lansstuss: unlike M+ where they're all against you
[1:59:16] Lansstuss: but same gist in the end
