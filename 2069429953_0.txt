[1:47:24] Matzefyr: Echo is a solid team, but they will never be the best in the world. Reason being is Cdew is on NA and so much better than any other healer in teh world. Likewise, they will never be better than The Move because Pikaboo plays here. Sorry, but this guys just plays way higher level than anyone EU
[1:47:25] cy4nerd: Truth is, PvP community on US is way bigger so that means more average players more inflation, so up until some level US Feels way easier than EU and then once it comes to top 2-3% its pretty much same
[1:47:41] Dreamy2k3: @whazz can u please tell me what you do with tinker helmet innstead of the other helmet that equips the 564 primary stat
[1:47:47] Sitikini: Truth is, PvP community on US is way bigger so that means more average players more inflation, so up until some level US Feels way easier than EU and then once it comes to top 2-3% its pretty much same

[2:27:38] iamreallyafan: @strengthofathousndmen yes but then its fair for both teams on eu matchups
[2:27:47] sistahfistah1: now people are coming to remind u of 6 years ago 2018 ziqoHmm

[2:28:32] Stigez: NA East ping is fine, tournement server is NA West. Playing on NA East you have good enough ping to both West and EU
[2:28:34] DCBen: to fly you out
[2:28:35] Stigez: that is how it is
[2:28:41] iamreallyafan: how can it be the same problem if u guys fly to na? u both play on na servers with same ping and then on eu with same ping
[2:28:41] Stigez: playing from EU to NA West is awful
[2:28:45] terranapart: Cdew lives on the East Coast so makes sense to play on an east coast server

[2:44:28] EmpStyle: Just curious, all you streamers always complain about the insane barrier to entry in wow, but you also lock all your addons behind pay walls, why is that? Feel like it's so counterintuitive and bad for the community? No bad vibes btw, just wondering :)
[2:44:32] SaltyBites: remember the image with the diggers
[2:45:01] muneplays: @EmpStyle i mean you could just learn how to make a WA yourself or download all the free auras
[2:45:06] bigclub666: no addon is behind a paywall you can go and invest your own time fidgeting with the options to adjust the specs
[2:45:12] DCBen: @sarug atleast on mage was it a must to get enough haste and vers

[2:46:27] assrug: EmpStyle there is shittons of really guid free uis availabile and by the time you are invested enough in the game to downlad a streamers ui i doubt that 4.99 is what is holding you back from getting into the game LUL
