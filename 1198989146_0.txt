[2:43:32] WPGDiaz: 500+ hours, 600 GS watermark. Literally done everything you can do. The last patch yes, it fixed a bunch of issues. But with typical server having only 500 players they need to merge. Game will 100% fix just right now its in limbo
[2:43:36] Lechop: If new world is on life support then so is every other mmo outside the big 3....
[2:43:41] modlost: @riperano what mmo is not repetitive?
[2:43:50] BitcoinBlake: New patch removed all the funny jokes! MUH JOKES!
[2:43:56] Lechop: @WPGDiaz they already said merges were inc
[2:44:28] WPGDiaz: @Lechop - They're def needed. It's why it's just on limbo/life support. Until then it's just a crafting sim

[6:01:14] Turbosoldier: @Keykeykadee I got r14 on my gnome, i kept telling myself next time around I would roll an orc...when you gank an undead rogue you can always win, when you gank an orc rogue its like rolling a dice
[6:01:33] aleron_wow: All states follow it. All states in a time zone have the same time in that zone.
[6:01:36] CrashYo: Had a few atempts... but wasn't welcome there :P

[6:03:33] Keykeykadee: @turbosoldier did u run into a lot of rogues?
[6:04:14] CrashYo: Doesn't Retail just reflect the state of the company ?
[6:04:15] xzeeb1: I am with you Tigen
[6:04:33] Malinkadink: WOTLK is where the game got really good imo, good quality of life, old talent system, all classes and specs were generally viable
[6:04:41] shawnquesty: I find Shadowlands to be bland
[6:04:43] Cybernytez: i play retail and im having fun ^^ but im mostly pvp so
[6:05:09] JohnWar70: can you speak german pls :D
[6:05:18] Turbosoldier: @Keykeykadee  Its all I would do is camp orgrimmar and pvp, and every class easy easy to kill for me, except orc rogues...ganking an undead rogue I knew he was dead before I even opened.. because I knew he wouldnt resist
[6:05:24] gHOsTa81: KaRappa
[6:05:33] spellingbxd: will you go horde for season of mastery, or stick to the NE?

[6:07:51] Kingkc26: is this just the old classic servers ?
[6:07:59] aleron_wow: Sorry, you guys are right about AZ not observing daylight savings; however, this is only possible because they are in their own time zone. AZ is mountain standard time, so they are not in the same time zone as the rest of the U.S. states. Obviously this is the same with Hawaii
[6:08:43] chimerablaque: I would love if they made new classic content at this point
[6:09:06] NlPSEYx: what class you think you are gonna main on retail?

[8:02:35] veiloflonelystars: @Kgizzi agreed, p1 is top notch, everyone lvling, random world pvp, professions etc
[8:02:47] Halflings: @Kgizzi expand on that, why the first 2 months?
[8:03:08] Kgizzi: @veiloflonelystars yea, I said they should have made a "World pvp server" with no BGs
[8:03:23] ItzN4tti: I'm hopeful that with mage boosting meta being broken and the quest XP increased that the world will survive late into the game. It was sad to see by P3 everyone just buying boosts
