[3:12:55] wookiefister: Fairbanks is the best PST PvP Server. They sent 3 WSG teams to the Summer Bowl Finals and supposedly one of their best teams didn’t even play in the tournament (Inertia). I just want to post this to dispell the mythos that Faerlina is “the” pvp server because a lot of streamers there, clearly Fairbanks which had 2 talented Alliance teams and 1 top horde team (Protect the Lumber) has the talent to compete. I hope to be transferring my team / friends to Fairbanks Alliance in the future.

[4:09:25] Officialfoxeh: Fairbanks is the best PST PvP Server. They sent 3 WSG teams to the Summer Bowl Finals and supposedly one of their best teams didn’t even play in the tournament (Inertia). I just want to post this to dispell the mythos that Faerlina is “the” pvp server because a lot of streamers there, clearly Fairbanks which had 2 talented Alliance teams and 1 top horde team (Protect the Lumber) has the talent to compete. I hope to be transferring my team / friends to Fairbanks Alliance in the future.

[4:25:11] Zhall0: Fairbanks is the best PST PvP Server. They sent 3 WSG teams to the Summer Bowl Finals and supposedly one of their best teams didn’t even play in the tournament (Inertia). I just want to post this to dispell the mythos that Faerlina is “the” pvp server because a lot of streamers there, clearly Fairbanks which had 2 talented Alliance teams and 1 top horde team (Protect the Lumber) has the talent to compete. I hope to be transferring my team / friends to Fairbanks Alliance in the future.

[5:05:53] hawkizor: serious.. you call this a pvp game? slowest most booring wow-game ever.. what a joke.. unfollowing
[5:05:53] toxokin: some nice Mario jumps
[5:05:56] hommesoja_no_jutsu: why would it be banned
[5:05:56] Wegstein: yeah gotta watch the French stream since it's not delayed
[5:05:58] spencerny13: ban spacebars
[5:06:02] acaran_: There are no banned jumps.
[5:06:04] Desikz: not a banned jump
[5:06:08] tokyosneed: will VC call for the DQ because he made the jump LUL
[5:06:09] bigmonka_: cancel culture here for the banned jumps
[5:06:14] acaran_: What are people on about, there are no banned jumps.
[5:06:24] lexzerr: no vc is going to win meanwhile
[5:06:25] NiecheTrips: hes used a special item called a 'jump-band' which is not banned for doing a jump that could be banned
[5:06:26] Synnester1251: DONT YOU KNOW! PUMP IT UP YOU GOT TO PUMP IT UP
[5:06:27] Desikz: banned jumps just insta kill you now
[5:06:27] bigmonka_: ^
[5:06:33] tmpvlnmx: Its called Safe-spots
[5:06:36] reggieledeux: That wasn’t even really a jump lmao
[5:06:37] AlphaGM: the only banned jumps are safespots / glitchy jumps
[5:06:42] Fate_HX: it is all about those jumps
[5:06:47] hommesoja_no_jutsu: @Desikz or make you dc ^^
[5:06:54] aceriabella: Are Battlegrounds the only place Bears are good in pvp?
[5:06:58] PembrokeWoW: every jump is a banned jump because i cant do it BabyRage
[5:07:05] tatterval: beeeeezy why did TY skeram not play?
[5:07:10] bigmonka_: ^^
[5:07:16] prong_: @aceriabella only wsg
[5:07:16] papabullyx: @aceriabella wsg to be precise
[5:07:20] hommesoja_no_jutsu: But he is on an invisible WALL BabyRage
[5:07:25] acaran_: Once again. THere are no banned jumps. If blizzard didn't like a jump, they either blocked it or added a death zone onto it.
[5:07:28] bigmonka_: lmaooo
[5:07:45] AlphaGM: ty skeram is still upset about the qualifiers bs so they didn't even bother trying in the finals
[5:07:49] mokrish_gehennas: @aceriabella these druids are deeper in resto than feral, but no, it's not the only use for druids
[5:07:50] gankaliciousherod: only other place bears would be "okay" is for spinning nodes in ab
[5:07:54] Metarra: This is a nobrainer, vc will win because Faerlina is the superior server
[5:08:08] Nize2: they took a top 6 spot for no reason, unfortunate for other teams
[5:08:22] spencerny13: i can’t press my spacebar! ban jump!
[5:08:23] suddenarthritis4: a really cool ctf map would have lanes, verticality in mid and a jungle imo
