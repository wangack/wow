[0:52:26] Kaype92: @towelliee are you ready for Sam Ehlinger season??
[0:52:30] Slitze: warriors the shit when it comes to tank in dragonflight?
[0:52:39] s1c58: nope, it's not on bar, TC does it for me
[0:52:42] ZeroNpcTV: you have to use 1 rend on 1 char and just thunderclap
[0:53:01] Mattsacre: Just got home from a halloween party its 4am. Whats good chat?
[0:53:18] pereadin: Good morning T

[0:53:42] heeyalex: @kalamari__ so its nott 09:07 right now or my phone dident change ?
[0:53:46] s1c58: yep just thunder clap and it will spread rend
[0:53:47] TheGiant99: sup guys
[0:53:53] Kaype92: He played with possibly the worst offensive line ever at Texas and he was a battering ram. He helped us win most of our games just by brute force lol
[0:54:10] ZeroNpcTV: i wasted my time applying rend before tc ;-;
[0:54:16] Slitze: thunderclap should auto rend or else i see why warriors are ass tanks
[0:54:17] kalamari__: @heeyalex no, you are good :D sry for the confusion
[0:55:06] heeyalex: @kalamari__ its all good but i wanted to dobbel cheek Poooound

[0:57:40] ZeroNpcTV: in raid i would've put the stamina and armor
[0:58:04] Kaype92: I’m wanting to tank in dragonflight in mostly mythic plus content but I’m deciding between monk and DH, what do you recommend @towelliee ?
[0:58:40] TheGiant99: Im enjoying FURY warrior alot
[0:58:58] deadman385: you see warriors getting nerfs
[0:59:19] xotankkk: most of the rage regeneration was nerfed
[0:59:37] pereadin: Yeah they were nuts
[0:59:38] TheGiant99: Yea prot warriors where meter toppers for sure at the start
[0:59:41] KhronikRage: Adjust the dk unholy dmg?
[0:59:46] pulnar: Warrior is tuned pretty good atm.. other tanks will follow
[1:00:01] nymike69: OK, so in your opinion, since Blizz went back to WOTLK, is the game fixable moving forward? Or is the game pretty fucked?
[1:00:04] xotankkk: shield slam was generating 20 rage it was ridiculous
[1:00:11] Kaype92: Isn’t prot paladin the worst tank atm? At least in terms of talents
[1:00:13] Kaype92: ?
[1:00:26] momzzze: o/
[1:00:33] pulnar: Bear is 100% the worst talent wise

[1:45:45] ChrisarN: Will DF be a success?
[1:45:52] Prestwood24: then 10% from new talents
[1:45:53] Unitos_: No, there's a void pat

[1:46:09] Wiba: its definitely a good thing

[3:13:39] epicpockettroll: im rerolling to ww cuz sp feels dead af on prepatch
[3:14:12] TheeCableguy: I think Pally's have a very big difference in skill. Most are not top tier so its the average person complaining and not seeing top tier people play it.
[3:14:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Consecrate is AOE damage on a short cooldown, it's not bad

[4:00:49] Vorrain: @Towelliee - end of xpac seems a good time to try on tanking for the first time. Keen on trying paladin - any tips before jumping in?
[4:00:55] kowaikokoro: ravenous frenzy was the only saving grace for bear, it got removed without any addition to the class, ursof fury nerf was the nail in the coffin
[4:00:56] Kineticbomb: Might aswell go healer tank

[4:03:39] kw3nk: also why do i have to decide between incap roar and stun
[4:03:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: At level 60, bear might be better off in forgetting Ursoc's and going as much disco bear as possible
[4:04:16] Artemisthemp: They should have delayed the expansion to next year and gotten stuff right
[4:04:25] kowaikokoro: compare the bear to the prot warrior tree LUL

[4:33:42] altair19992: first expac i am leveling on a dead realm and xfering to my guild after KEKW
[4:33:49] Dudutoolbox: who are you rooting for in the world series? @Towelliee
[4:33:51] Ekazz: @Towelliee Legit question; To you and chat. I played WoW, just as much as you, for around 18 years now. I might want to play a Warlock for DF; is it worth to boost it to 60 or should I just level it manually ?
[4:33:59] ThePawPaw: am I blind or i see only Blue and Green classes and thats not monks/hunters D:
[4:34:34] Vakje: @Ekazz until release is super quick to level, save your cash
[4:34:51] tanek1966: My personal preference when it comes to a class I'm not that familiar with is to level it myself, that way I learn it.
[4:35:03] szble: yeah lock/mage
[4:35:07] Architank: warlock always has a good spec
[4:35:11] Vorrain: @Towelliee - just saw your Rick Bobby and Cal Naughton Jr card on the gram.....that is amazing!! Gotta be the pinnacle of the collection
[4:35:17] SpoofAvatar: 1 of the specs will do well
[4:35:20] altair19992: warlock is in a class their own even among the favorites KEKW
[4:35:21] Kinghorn: any pure dps spec will have 1 OP spec
[4:35:25] Othala254: basically, if it only has DPS specs, expect one of them to be good
[4:35:35] DM_Hakai: Season 2 of SL was trash don't say that
[4:35:39] zeeAbe: Warlock, hunter and mage are always safe picks because you have three specs to choose from and more than likely one of those specs will be at least playable
[4:35:51] zeeAbe: Warlocks especially because the utility is just too good
[4:36:01] zeeAbe: You can make locks deal 80% of the damage others do and you still bring one LUL
[4:36:11] TheeCableguy: this the first expac in a long time where the "play what you enjoy" might be the right answer lol
[4:36:16] TheeCableguy: Unless you pushing CE
