[0:08:12] Ecsol: We live in a society
[0:08:23] legoagent2: tempted to mass dono subs to hijack the stream with the pony mod on the board
[0:08:34] CallMiiChad: chad why does his charactor look kinda rizzy
[0:08:38] CallMiiChad: *chat
[0:08:39] capitano49: creating your first character and leveling it was great in wow
[0:08:42] geokouts: when i was 25-30 Duskwood was PACKED! now other zones have people
[0:09:11] daciderearl: Get Bulletin Addon, makes finding groups way easier
[0:09:26] JohnTheTurtleMa: Just finished the Plague wars audio books loved it cant belive i didnt know about 40k before 2023
[0:09:31] geokouts: SM transport sure got cheaper, it was 3g 2 days ago
[0:09:54] Shinchandan: This phase leveling is kinda easy, can do stockades then SM to 40
[0:09:57] sadsaratabad: man early day in the office tommy?
[0:10:13] capitano49: drinked Any Coffe yet?
[0:10:27] geokouts: did 5 Gy runs and got 2/3 druid runes :)
[0:10:38] capitano49: feels great to being able to handle an addiction
[0:10:52] scottish1900: Man, I did the 25-40 grind in dungeons, never again lmao
[0:11:04] legoagent2: I would feel bad for interrupting your WoW though.... hypothetically, if it (pony mod) did rise to 6 hours, when would it even occur. Hypotheticcaly of course
[0:11:22] geokouts: i believe now is the perfect time to start leveling 25-40. last week was soooo packed
[0:11:25] scottish1900: It was really rough, caused a lot of burn out doing nothing but tanking scarlet monestary and SFK, big despair
[0:11:26] T1_Draven: @legoagent2 pureley hypothetically right Kappa
[0:11:43] mousalil: Hello
[0:11:47] legoagent2: @T1_Draven Purely hypothetically Kappa
[0:11:57] Jonor: thats why i could never really get into retail
[0:12:06] JohnTheTurtleMa: Sounds depressing
[0:12:10] scottish1900: Retail is really rough for "I am behind, I can't do content anymore"
[0:12:22] minmiminmi: Our retirement homes are gonna have the best LAN servers
[0:12:37] defensiveMAN: what is the plan today?
[0:12:47] luckyshot6767: I feel like this SoD thing is like an extended playtest.. should I just wait until they get 60 or is the low level meta worth
[0:12:49] Jonor: they really need to make a WoW2
[0:13:07] scottish1900: Extended playtest? It's new content entirely all the way to 60
[0:13:14] scottish1900: and potentially at 60, not a playtest, new raids
[0:13:47] minmiminmi: very true, gotta channel that talent into something actually useful
[0:13:55] scottish1900: I enjoy parsing, and trying to parse, but I am not into it now that I am tanking
[0:13:59] legoagent2: so in short words, channel the competitive drive into stream content?
[0:14:26] Jonor: I mean your france rp game last week (i think) was pretty awesome because you were giga competetive
[0:14:28] scottish1900: DPS is hard to see logs and see bad parses, just because I feel like i am being a shitter and not putting forth 100%, tank tho, as long as I don't die and everyone else lives and does damage
[0:14:31] scottish1900: I don't feel bad at all
[0:14:35] luckyshot6767: @scottish1900 people spent like how many months at lvl 25? that's not a whole game
[0:14:43] minmiminmi: Wisdom gained
[0:14:44] defensiveMAN: what is the stream plan today?
[0:14:47] scottish1900: It isn't a whole game, it's part of the game
[0:15:11] luckyshot6767: @scottish1900 so you think it's worth to spend the time at the endgame at these lower levels?
[0:15:11] capitano49: it feels like uni exams is not much worth nowadays
[0:15:17] scottish1900: Yes, it's fun
[0:15:37] justinian4105: 1 year of amazing content
[0:15:43] CircleSocialClub: ewWow
[0:15:47] scottish1900: Classes play very differently than they did in original classic, new specs as well. Close to a new game as we are gonna get for this
[0:16:01] luckyshot6767: cool I might try it again then at least 40 is more interesting than 25 to me. I played classic vanilla too much
[0:16:20] raffitrick: Hi cutie
[0:16:22] AylaThatsMe: mornig cutie
[0:16:29] AylaThatsMe: hey don tcopy me!
[0:16:34] scottish1900: 25-40 is a rough levelling area, it was the worst for me
[0:16:34] Shinchandan: @luckyshot6767 40 definitely add a bit more to alot of specs, more talents makes things easier
[0:16:47] vacerss: Got quite a lot of loot yesterday KEKW
[0:16:49] AylaThatsMe: PopNemo DinoDance aylath1Bonk aylath1Bonk aylath1Bonk
[0:16:57] capitano49: do you put much time into the ”business” aspect of the stream
[0:17:01] scottish1900: Horde size I always run out of quests around 30-31, and have to dungeon grind to get to 35 to catch back up
[0:17:03] Jonor: i dont have friends ;(
[0:17:08] AylaThatsMe: what are u drinking?

[0:18:41] raffitrick: Yo
[0:18:47] vacerss: We teach eachother when doing gnomer and stuff
[0:18:47] scottish1900: Classic is really odd for an MMO, it feels like the community as a whole is more chill and vibes
[0:19:04] scottish1900: A few rampant assholes, but a lot of people just vibe and play the game
[0:19:14] geokouts: lib gives good cloth and stave

[0:21:07] capitano49: we love watching you play got CarlSmile
[0:21:09] scottish1900: The last two bosses in BFD were rough at first, but I think the last two in gnomer are gonna be a lot harder for longer
[0:21:30] CircleSocialClub: How may hrs of wow today? Asking for a friend
[0:21:43] ChadMcThunderShlong: Got Mod for which game got updated ?
[0:21:50] Jonor: ck2 agot still goated

[0:24:06] scottish1900: It's a version of classic, with new abilities and content
[0:24:07] luckyshot6767: wow vanilla was based on older games who themsevles were based on boardgames like D&D its super long
[0:24:09] capitano49: theras is looking for friends

[0:25:22] iteryn: KEKW I'm in the office and have you for background noise
[0:25:28] scottish1900: I think he is saying if it wasn't a grind what would keep you playing? Which is weird
[0:25:31] capitano49: last time was 5 months ago probably @tommykaylive
[0:25:34] randomguy15091: brb

[0:26:34] legoagent2: I probs should have used more clear explanation and not try to be funny
[0:27:05] capitano49: tommykUseYourHead
[0:27:12] chickenlittlettv: the 1v1 grind is more important then school Kappa
[0:27:26] scottish1900: Paladins man, they are glad it was 10 man raids let me tell you
[0:27:41] scottish1900: Refreshing a full raid group before every boss was rough
[0:27:49] capitano49: long time to go soldier
[0:28:49] vacerss: For me it was like 1.5h per level
[0:28:55] legoagent2: I meant that if WoW wasn't a grind, then how would Blizzard keep you playing and keep paying the monthly subscription TO play. it's only a small indie company you know smh, you they can run weekly events LUL
[0:29:03] capitano49: yeyeye

[0:32:05] Cadurana: Badlands? maybe
[0:32:10] Werxteam98: its way to early, i think
[0:32:16] scottish1900: I think 40 is weird for alliance, it's a lot of zones, not just the one like it was for Duskwood
[0:32:18] capitano49: I mean no real breakfast
[0:32:26] vacerss: You farm thousands of tribal troll necklaces and turn in the repeatable quest
[0:32:30] scottish1900: Quests in southern STV, Badlands... Desolace too I think?
[0:32:47] vacerss: It is fucked up KEKW

[0:35:10] mironp: Btw tommy do you know how long will you be on wow? 2 hours or something?
[0:35:17] 782ju: I hate chocolate
[0:35:25] scottish1900: Mage and Priest have a relatively good amount of overlap I guess
[0:35:40] scottish1900: Our mage knows priest stuff like the back of his hand, and our shadowpriest knows mage very well
[0:35:49] imBlaxican: This SoD?
[0:36:01] raffitrick: @tommykaylive if you are planning on returning to Total war Warhammer theres gonna be a patch on the latest DLC on the 22nd

[0:39:11] 782ju: HAng
[0:39:13] scottish1900: Chaos Dwarfs, warriors of chaos, greenskins, and beastmen all feel so good in Warhammer
[0:39:26] Werxteam98: your group is slow as fuck tho, no aoe besides lock
[0:39:29] CircleSocialClub: Looks pretty boring tbh
[0:39:34] mironp: Ok thanks, have fun in wow
[0:39:46] eazzyd: Can you more or less explain the problem you have with your level in WoW? Why is it suddenly demotivating even though you were doing the same month ago or so?
[0:40:13] legoagent2: States group is all right, starts flaming the warlock player
[0:40:18] legoagent2: The duality of man
[0:40:54] Nonameqt: just do the weekly in ashenvale and you get excalted overtime if you dont want to grind

[0:42:04] mironp: you grinded like madman and now its worthless, gg KEKW
[0:42:24] mironp: the grind kinda was, not the items..
[0:43:07] The_Yazoo: Is the guild doing BFD again today?
[0:43:11] legoagent2: like am I the only who thinks making comments about a player's ability/skill, but then not directly telling them how to play better, is an L take?
[0:43:12] mironp: Yeah ok true, missed that argument

[0:48:41] CircleSocialClub: would imagine in most placews you need to be the voting age to run
[0:48:42] scottish1900: Which is absolutely wild, the youngest people should be the ones trying to do things, 35 is ancient when it comes to modern politics
[0:48:44] FeldyTV: random fact: burkina faso has the youngest leader with 34 years
[0:48:50] Jonor: the east is constantly on fire lol
[0:49:02] KingGeraint: Chat, would you suck yourself off if you could?
[0:49:02] 782ju: The whole world is
[0:49:08] aegontragaryen: hey tommy do you have any movie or film recommenditons
[0:49:11] kefyrasFTW: they don't let to be president younger than 40, so there is ageism already
[0:49:16] aegontragaryen: series
[0:49:16] FeldyTV: yea, still kinda a teenager LULW
[0:49:17] JohnTheTurtleMa: No san marino has the youngest at the age of 29
[0:49:19] The_Bear_U: @KingGeraint  SUSSY ?
[0:49:31] mironp: I just dont like the argument against Biden that he is too old.. Trump is 4years younger, and his physical health is probably worse, biden exercises and stuff.. Both are too old....
[0:49:34] capitano49: well if you can’t take care of your chat you can probably lead a country

[0:50:03] oldghostfgh: why would i watch one of my films?
[0:50:11] CircleSocialClub: So you would be a live streamer?
[0:50:17] Ecsol: Joe Biden unironically has the best chance of beating Trump compared to any other politician. Newsom, Kamala, Joe Biden beats em all
[0:50:23] fxbeee_: @mironp but isnt he like demented or is that just republican propaganda
[0:50:28] FeldyTV: @JohnTheTurtleMa Google says 37 Nerdge

[0:51:01] dyldthedane: Kinda like xi? Tommy?  With going to the ricefields and "blessing them" / touching the grain, blessing a workers toilet etc? Except you'd actually be fixing the field and toilet?
[0:51:05] aegontragaryen: LUL he is kinda right tho
[0:51:09] legoagent2: I think the issue with country and it's 2 canditates, is that both parties are trying to run on nostalgia boots for who should run for president, with their party philosophy beliving it is a fool's errand to run younger, less heard of candidates
[0:51:14] qwertyccxz: have you finished Ready player One tommy?
[0:51:15] Ecsol: If the priority is beating Trump, Joe Biden is the best chance of doing it

[0:52:28] dyldthedane: @legoagent2 Yeah 2 parties ain't doing you guys a favor. Also no limits on how much you can raise for running etc, is also mad in 2024 and no transparency just makes it even worse
[0:52:32] fxbeee_: @fxbeee_ i think there was a court hearing because of documents and the jury decided he is too old to have done it intentionally but yeah not really proof
[0:52:40] qwertyccxz: what would you do to fix that movie?
[0:52:50] kebe16: Have you heard about the hungarian demonstration???
[0:52:51] JohnTheTurtleMa: nvm he was youngest no anymore in office the actual youngest is the French pm who is 34 years old but after him like actual leader is the bucino faso guy but he couped and wasnt elected

[0:55:21] FeldyTV: YEP
[0:55:26] Slippy313: doesn't she single handely boost the GDP of any city she goes to on tour lol
[0:55:28] scottish1900: People are very judgemental, just the way they are
[0:55:32] dyldthedane: Kanye sucks LUL and it legit hurts my brain that he ever was a person people look towards for political advice
[0:55:36] dyldthedane: its soo mindboggling
[0:55:37] taiscronqvist: what is that ?
[0:55:56] capitano49: I mean dune looks cool but just not my thing
[0:55:58] legoagent2: Personally, my favourite actor is  Matthew Broderick, especially since my favourite movie is WarGames (1983)

[1:02:57] RutgerVerhox: Good day boys
[1:03:17] Bence9811: hello
[1:03:31] Yinyatto: thats the main skill about playing a healer in pvp is being able to do whatever it takes to survive vs people trying to nuke you down, the dps job of course to help peel them off you

[1:10:06] n1kkix3: @KingGeraint we should tax the 99.9% and redistribute all their money to me

[1:17:01] gonkler: LUL
[1:17:10] lijokaa: atm a union in Sweden fucks Tesla a bit lmao
[1:17:15] alex_mvg: we should empower unions the problem is sometimes they get politicised. E.g., when we had a far laeft government the unions kept quiet even tho the country was going to shit
[1:17:20] zeffff2: @fouad_ok_ didn't Hasan try something like that lol
[1:17:29] geokouts: yeap got in

[1:17:35] fouad_ok_: bruh
[1:17:40] CircleSocialClub: In a capitalist system the wealth accumulates in the top, so we need regulations to redistribute it, normally called tax... but everyone complains when they get taxed
[1:17:40] bogi944: @alex_mvg sounds like this south park episode with "a little change please??"
[1:17:46] capitano49: @lijokaa LUL
[1:17:50] driftphysic: that's why even tho biden is very old he's the only president to stand with a union
[1:17:54] gonkler: TRUE

[1:18:16] gonkler: "communism" is a carte blanche to deny something you dont like
[1:18:17] wolfpoops: Tommy right now > BASED
[1:18:19] H4Hollow: as a european i dont really have that since we have so much workers rights and welfare
[1:18:25] legoagent2: but the issue is, the less money I have, the more I sympathise with the left, but the more money I have, the More I sympathise with healthy business
[1:18:43] legoagent2: big... Healthy.... business
[1:18:45] gonkler: @legoagent2 which is fair enough if you're out for yourself, but don't disguise it as trying to help the country
[1:18:45] marvin1995xo: sod is dead allready no point of leveleling

[1:18:58] gonkler: @dyldthedane RIP free thought LUL
[1:18:59] lijokaa: the reason is that Tesla refuses to sign a collective agreement for the employees/union members.
[1:19:04] Cadurana: @TommyKayLIVE  can't you go under indipendant or something like that ?
[1:19:05] croat1: arent unions only in public sector?
[1:19:07] Feedbackgaming: the 1% don't need to unionise. they're already rich enough
[1:19:09] VELIKOLEPNYJMAESTRO: Twitch has a right to ban everyone he wants

[1:19:50] lijokaa: ngl somtimes i feel the opposite. I work at a bank.

[1:20:20] bogi944: LUL
[1:20:20] beircheart: I helped my workplace unionize and got bullied out of my job. Currently in the process of trying to sue them for hostile workplace shit.
[1:20:23] zeffff2: @Oni_Crumper only in Ohio! DIESOFCRINGE
[1:20:31] gonkler: what needs to happen is that every viewer here gets a teachers education and starts doing the good work
[1:20:35] capitano49: I would get bullied if I put on this on a party
[1:20:39] gonkler: spread the good work

[1:21:34] fmmtoatesluate: union rep
[1:21:35] Zanpander00: steward
[1:21:37] CircleSocialClub: IMO we need to stop taxing labour so hard, and start taxing wealth, stocks, land ect... Labour tax is a very ineffective way of redistibruting from the rich since they do very little labour, and most income is from investments ect.
[1:21:39] mischamoo94: workers council
[1:21:39] gonkler: @n1kkix3 turn that andrew tate fan into a tommykay fan LUL
[1:21:41] RutgerVerhox: Like a worker's council
[1:21:41] johnsnus00: works Council

[1:21:51] dyldthedane: ye
[1:21:53] fmmtoatesluate: it's called union rep in the UK as far as I know

[1:22:02] capitano49: does the company pay for them? and why  @tommykaylive

[1:22:09] jerrymore: german boss LUL
[1:22:09] johnsnus00: but that for example those not exist in switzerland we dont have that.
[1:22:12] dyldthedane: a workers council ye
[1:22:22] Yinyatto: you know what, this is how it should work. you have to beat your boss in a wrestling match to get your above inflation pay rise every april  kekw
[1:22:22] bogi944: SoUnDs lIkE cOmMuNiSm fOr Me
[1:22:45] gonkler: LUL
[1:22:57] FeldyTV: betriebsrat is the biggest scam in capitalism
[1:23:12] Yinyatto: imagin how fit people would get under that scheme
[1:23:15] capitano49: where is the union for 1 euro job @tommykaylive
[1:23:56] legoagent2: That sounds nice, it sounds like a good way for those who are homeless/hit rock bottom to climb back up into the echelons of society
[1:24:06] taiscronqvist: why would there
[1:24:13] gonkler: but then again it's also sounds like a good way to make €450 continously
[1:24:22] capitano49: how stupid are people if they don’t figure that out them selves @tommykaylive
[1:24:24] RutgerVerhox: Too many

[1:24:31] lijokaa: sue them LUL
[1:24:32] Yinyatto: thats wild but yeh alot
[1:24:35] dyldthedane: was just about to say Rutger
[1:24:38] dyldthedane: too many probs
[1:24:42] lijokaa: thats why you got unions
[1:24:57] FeldyTV: I kinda feel the point why ppl dont ask their boss, its hard
[1:25:05] gonkler: north of you in denmark there's unions for everything
[1:25:06] Nightbot: Command only authorised for Kaas
[1:25:18] zilek1444: lol Verdi IG Metall etc biggest shit
[1:25:28] shadowmakess: I am a MFA in germany there are unions
[1:25:36] shadowmakess: but you have to sign up for them
[1:25:40] ChaoticFlorius: @TommyKayLIVE Ollo peepoClap
[1:25:45] dyldthedane: Just to expand on that Tommy, since Denmark is very close to you guys. We by law, have to have it declared by our bosses or they can risk heavy fines. So luckily or positively, i've never had that experience, cause my Bosses always informed me
[1:25:45] Cadurana: I think we have a uninon for everything really.. its soo odd for me to hear others dont have it
[1:25:49] shadowmakess: like 15 euros a year
[1:25:54] zilek1444: do you even know what verdi represents? lol
[1:26:04] lijokaa: my brothers wife got yeeted while she was about to give birth. With some shit excuse, she brought the union in and got to keep her job during the whole leave. Then she quit mid pregnancy and got a better job.
[1:26:05] jerrymore: twitch union
[1:26:05] Jonor: when we had water damage in our apartment our landlord didnt tell us about rent reduction. I paid full rent for 5 months..
[1:26:17] imBlaxican: Yah that's nice, not draining all your mana
[1:26:20] gonkler: @lijokaa W
[1:26:24] JohnTheTurtleMa: Tommy needs to creat the Streamer Union of Germany
[1:26:37] Yinyatto: this is a problem in UK where if you join a union in an area of work that is poorly represented by unions like shop workers, if you join a union they will look for any excuse to get rid of you or make it uncomfortable to work in order to replace you with a non-union worker
[1:27:01] CircleSocialClub: I think unions should be a universal thing done by the state, cause every worker need that kind of protection. But historically they are not....
[1:27:01] defensiveMAN: chat when is wow over?
[1:27:05] shadowmakess: there is also a uinon for Altersbetreugung
[1:27:05] gonkler: no matter what verdi represents even if you're right it's 1 "union" compared to 1 union for everything in denmark
[1:27:08] gonkler: LUL
[1:27:37] dyldthedane: @gonkler I mean we got more than 1 union here? Not sure what you mean?
[1:27:38] zilek1444: u just talk shit the unionization percentage in germany is crazy high
[1:27:44] capitano49: where is markoni union @tommykaylive
[1:28:00] gonkler: @dyldthedane what I mean is even if Verdi is a decent union, it's the 1 union they could find where as we in Denmark have a union for everything
[1:28:04] CircleSocialClub: Art of the deal
[1:28:13] Ecsol: Gamers need to unionize and stop the industry from being so stupid. GAMERS RISE UP
[1:28:18] driftphysic: 16% are in unions in Germany but its declining @TommyKayLIVE
[1:28:19] shadowmakess: 2 min ad in the middel of discusion :(
[1:28:26] gonkler: the argument is just kinda off "we dont have shitty unions in germany, look at verdi"
[1:28:26] Yinyatto: some unions are fake thats another problem where the top brass of the union sold out
[1:28:30] wolfamongsheep1776: LOL you preach worker rights but pay markoni minimum wage yikes my man
[1:28:41] dyldthedane: @gonkler ohh that's true and also a bit stricter laws. As I wrote, here they bosses have a legal obligation to inform you of your rights
[1:28:43] CircleSocialClub: @wolfamongsheep1776 Markonni gets like 50%
[1:28:45] dyldthedane: @gonkler or risk hard fines

[1:31:11] Ecsol: My dick is big, my dick is wide, my dick is like a pizza pie
[1:31:16] dyldthedane: @gonkler but tbf easy for us to say with our "biased" lenses. Im sure we as nordic countries do the same in some aspects
[1:31:19] Jarl_Thoman: odd question, but thoughts on people doing the lottery every week?
[1:31:20] Yinyatto: hahahaha

[1:32:08] Ecsol: Balls-kans

[1:32:14] gonkler: @dyldthedane so maybe we blame "capitalist america" instead of communism LUL
[1:32:23] mironp: @Feedbackgaming But did you consider lower taxes?
[1:32:24] dyldthedane: @gonkler yep LUL i'm of that view aswell, so it's fair to argue that we're biased and have the same behavior at times, instead of looking more nuanced at things
[1:32:27] CircleSocialClub: 0Head The lottery is like our system, it works on the illusion that you can become rich
[1:32:28] JohnTheTurtleMa: Aliens take the form of money when they come to earth
[1:33:04] gonkler: @dyldthedane i do think that the financially weakest person in denmark has a significantly higher standard of living than the poorest american
[1:33:06] dyldthedane: @gonkler btw hygge from århus innit <3
[1:33:06] RutgerVerhox: @CircleSocialClub KEKW Lottery = Capitalism in a nutshell

[1:33:09] Jarl_Thoman: yeah i get that, my dad keeps doing the lottery lol

[1:38:29] gonkler: @dyldthedane apparently when they made the city wall in 1650 they had farmers from the entire country bring dirt for the construction so it's actually possible to look at the state of the earth different places in denmark in 1650

[1:40:50] dyldthedane: @gonkler They recently found a ring from 400, making for growing speculations that a sealandish noble family, ruled parts of denmark at that time. They've tied the ring to the a line of french kings, speculating that the ring could have been a gift, to tie the two realms & families
[1:40:51] wolfpoops: i will become one dont worry, i'll buy you a mansion

[1:41:55] dyldthedane: @gonkler yeah pretty darn cool! It was found under 10 kms from the site where they found guldhornene
[1:42:00] gonkler: @dyldthedane that is so early, year 400, for them to be married to the french nobility
[1:42:10] wolfpoops: @TommyKayLIVE the UK and Japan are in a recession right now sooo

[1:42:48] dyldthedane: @gonkler yeah it's much earlier than previously speculated, that the two realms had contact or than previously thought. Really interesting if it is indeed the case, that we had something to do with france at that time
[1:42:49] gonkler: @dyldthedane didn't they find guldhornene on a field? wasn't it some farmer? LUL
[1:42:58] dyldthedane: @gonkler yep :D it was
[1:43:05] CircleSocialClub: Bricks are good
[1:43:17] dyldthedane: @gonkler random farmer that was just like.. hey these look kinda neat and maybe old? LUL turns out they were from year 500 something
[1:43:19] eurokosmos: is the leipzig housing market good?
[1:43:21] mironp: Yeah but hindsight is 20/20 Tommy. Not every farma company was the winner... it is easy to say now you could have made money. And other part is you have to have big balls to hold on and not sell at like 50% profit...... @TommyKayLIVE
[1:43:33] JohnTheTurtleMa: But i think you should also invest into metal like gold and silver have that safe purse wich will never loose its price
[1:43:34] gonkler: @dyldthedane yeah I always felt danish history was too focused on denmark and barely mentions relations with european powers
[1:43:36] dyldthedane: @gonkler the ring now found is dated to 400 something, making it around 100 years earlier than guldhornene
[1:43:36] SirMaddin1: immo are always a nice invest we build a house in 2001 for 150k now its 450k minimum

[1:44:42] Feedbackgaming: @wolfpoops i hear the ukraine real estate market is about to boom
[1:44:46] eurokosmos: 500k was cheap
[1:44:51] mironp: Yeah but the stock will not rise infinite. You need to know when to sell not just when to buy... especially if you want to make it your income, not just hoarding money
[1:45:03] wolfpoops: @wolfpoops the rebuilding funds yep
[1:45:06] mironp: Construction companies that go to ukraine yeah....
[1:45:07] Bence9811: true
[1:45:07] wolfpoops: thats what im doing too
[1:45:12] bogi944: @viktor_mehl It's not as bad as you think or the media says. The worst polution is created by planes and cars and coal-fired power station. If you mine bitcoin with nuclear power planets or solar energy it's not bad as everybody says.
[1:45:27] dyldthedane: Ohh they will 100%
[1:45:31] dyldthedane: I predict it already

[1:48:34] FrostBitey10: putin is scary because he's not a complete idiot and he usually knows what he's doing (although he is a psycho)
[1:48:36] JohnTheTurtleMa: Putin ist a master of propoganda not that many people support him he makes it look like a lot support him. In reality he rules with fear. He dosnt need love he is content with quite hate
[1:48:38] SumiNoob: It's very telling of many things lol.
[1:48:48] mironp: I really think we should not pat each other backs and say Putin already failed... We will see how US election goes and everything else... The war is not won, the support is going down......
[1:48:49] wolfpoops: Putin was in power since 2000, putin was in power when i was born and he still is, image how that influences the russian populice
[1:48:55] viktor_mehl: im just most afraid that the support for ukraine will start decreasing
[1:48:55] Kryos_Pizza: putin using the tyranny build

[1:48:56] Slippy313: Apparrently he is also the richest guy on earth but he just doesn't advertise it lol
[1:49:06] bogi944: @viktor_mehl The German goverment is buying Russian Oil from India and they pay more for that the hypocrisy is real. They can keep talking but i will never listen to this dumb people and than with the same mouth they say "BiTcOiN iS bAd fOr tHe EnViRoNmeNt"
[1:49:08] Slippy313: like he has mansions in the names of other people
[1:49:39] viktor_mehl: @bogi944 putin is bad and bitcoin is bad and useless. Cope.
[1:49:40] dyldthedane: @mironp very true and sadly even if support is not going down here in EU, us EU guys close to russias doorstep needs the bigger dog like the US or we've lost.
[1:49:41] eurokosmos: you know who is more scary? Xi jinping. he has complete and utter dictatorial control. Opposition is squashed.
[1:49:43] wolfpoops: nah one of our royal families here in the gulf are def the richest
[1:49:43] zeffff2: Putin basically owns the entire country so yeah I'd say he's one of the richest men alive
[1:49:52] dyldthedane: @mironp so alot could be lost on elections in the US, if they withdraw support
[1:49:55] fouad_ok_: Nan give it 80-100 year he'll be forgetten

[1:50:29] pavliknx: There is no energy diversification, you can't just buy Oil from someone else, because it's all the same commodity in a large market. The real solution to NOT buying russian oil is to not use oil. That is to use different energy technology. Acoiding, sactioning russian Oil is just a game for PR. THe real thing is to stop using it.

[2:19:27] dyldthedane: @The_Yazoo no like.. in the tv series "vikings". a viking is close to being beheaded and he asks one guy to hold his hair, so that it doesn't get bloddied. So they hold his hair infront of him and just before he's beheaded, he pulls back, so that the guy that holds his hair gets his hands cut off
[2:19:27] gonkler: @quirin0 as fearless in death as he was in life
