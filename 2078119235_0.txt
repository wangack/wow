[0:01:19] Zuldak: I know road construction is necessary but the traffic is so awful D:
[0:01:28] whatsupwithnick: lemme turn on my PC lol
[0:01:37] whatsupwithnick: time to get out of bed
[0:01:40] sammmy__: burkeRave

[0:05:01] Streamlabs: khaliaas just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:05:05] whatsupwithnick: good morning afternoon everything
[0:05:12] Octopixy1971: Hello Hazel and Miss Kira hope you are feeling better today
[0:05:15] Zuldak: Feeling any better? Or medicated?
[0:05:21] Octopixy1971: hazelShiny hazelLove
[0:05:44] whatsupwithnick: OH YEAHHHH ITS MARCH
[0:06:04] kryptogirrl: hellooo
[0:06:07] mererndl: hi hazel! you inspired me to try hc sf. made an undead warlock and everything is scary, but fun!
[0:06:22] wolfcloudchaser80: Can confirm, I have forgotten once.
[0:07:42] saga_no: I... need to find a way to farm flightstones :/
[0:07:52] saga_no: I'm like 5 ilvls away from being able to queue Solo Shuffle
[0:08:01] whatsupwithnick: feb was very good
[0:09:00] Zuldak: Honestly smashing out 5 m plus dungeons isn't the worst this month
[0:09:07] saga_no: I've done the whole LFR raid already, I'm hoping to avoid keys; WQs is next on my list
[0:09:17] Perkolate: for sub goals... how many subs for spriest magetower round 2?
[0:09:36] cashthb: @saga_no why you need flight stones for shuffle?
[0:09:42] saga_no: I suppose I'd get some from the sidequests in the Emerald Dream too
[0:09:53] saga_no: @cashthb To upgrade gear for ilvl so I can queue
[0:10:10] jeffdmk: also remind yourself that you have great wildlife clothes
[0:10:17] Zuldak: One of the best pet collections in the world. If blizz made a trading post to do that your pets had issues with... yeah they should look at it
[0:10:18] cashthb: you don't need to upgrade it, bg gear is ready to go
[0:10:27] GreenArrowed: oooh trading post
[0:10:48] saga_no: @cashthb Apparently not? I equipped it all and Im still a few ilvls short
[0:11:09] saga_no: And upgrading the Honor Greens would give more ilvl... sooo.... I need flightstones
[0:11:31] cashthb: @saga_no not to be pushy, but are you sure?
[0:11:51] cashthb: It shouldn't increase the pvp ilvl afaik
[0:11:52] saga_no: I check it every time - so fairly certain - but I'll still check every time I look into it
[0:12:00] anker_jym: Started my SSF journey last night. Trying for Warrior again, because apparently I enjoy pain
[0:12:19] GreenArrowed: oh man gl
[0:12:35] saga_no: I've also been working on getting a complete armor set + weapon(s) ...so like - I'll equip everything I have and check and then go back and see if there's things I can upgrade to get more pvp-ilvl
[0:12:37] jeffdmk: blizz should make a trading post thing that requires the 400 honor level pet
[0:12:39] anker_jym: I am a Night Elf, so the blessing from Elune was appropriate lol
[0:12:49] anker_jym: @greenarrowed thanks!!
[0:13:13] saga_no: I did make sure to craft myself a chest piece with 480-something pvp-ilvl so that helped
[0:13:34] Terra___l: never thought i need 2  helmet transmog slots but after todays traders post items i need it
[0:13:40] saga_no: I'm at pvp-ilvl 470 or something - need to be 473 for the shuffle queue
[0:13:51] jeffdmk: That thing called sleeping?
[0:13:55] GreenArrowed: 7% left to my vicious mount. friday seems to be the day all of the DH and DKs play
[0:14:05] GreenArrowed: @saga_no can you grab some pvp trinkets?
[0:14:19] saga_no: @GreenArrowed Already did - and I prioritise upgrading those
[0:14:42] saga_no: I think I'm only missing the PvP weapon to have the complete set
[0:14:49] GreenArrowed: @saga_no what slots are you missing? for pvp it should be counting your pvp ilvl, not your pve ilvl
[0:15:06] gordastico: do you sleep with your cat? I remember waking in the middle of the night, short of breath, because my kitty was crushing my windpipe LUL
[0:15:12] saga_no: I have two rings, both trinkets, a full (I think) set of armor - with a crafted chest piece
[0:15:26] Zuldak: IMHO the most important pillow goes between the knees to help the hips stay in position. At least for side sleepers
[0:15:32] cashthb: @saga_no well that's it, you need the full set
[0:15:38] aerissune: My spouse got a shoulder replacement, and now we are pillow tower experts!
[0:15:49] Ujai321: morning. how are you feeling today?
[0:15:58] GreenArrowed: i have one of those super long tube/bolster shaped pillows. it's amazing.
[0:16:01] cashthb: @saga_no does it have a current season mark thigny on it?
[0:16:05] Speedruz: hey hazel, how would your approach to life be, if wow was to shut down tomorrow @HazelNuttyGames
[0:16:06] kynlaeh: my cat sleeps on my pillow with me curled up like a ball
[0:16:20] Zuldak: You can do Kara chess event for 75 points
[0:16:21] witchhobbit: hello hazelShiny
[0:16:26] saga_no: @cashthb The crafted piece? Yeah - I made sure to use only current season stuff on it
[0:16:40] saga_no: and that piece did bump my pvp ilvl a lot - so it must be working
[0:16:56] jeffdmk: 6 quest seems to be a reason to work on quest completion on att
[0:16:56] Ujai321: professional Subnautica streamer
[0:16:58] heldtheline: pro hearthstone bg streamer?
[0:17:06] Zuldak: You could always become a video editor
[0:17:08] saga_no: (The tooltip on it says it'll be X ilvl in PvP - blabla)
[0:17:15] emerald27x: wow is shutting down?
[0:17:23] cashthb: you could become a professional call of duty player
[0:17:27] wolfcloudchaser80: Fortunately it's HazelNuttyGames and not HazelNuttyWarcraft
[0:17:34] Ujai321: @emerald27x no, it's a hypothetical
[0:17:35] kynlaeh: i mean you have at least 3 expacs unless a meteor hits cali lol
[0:18:10] jeffdmk: Kripp is even good at bgs and he gets the view so i assume you could do that same
[0:18:20] Zuldak: Yeah but you fiddle around with things well and make it work. You'd be fine
[0:18:34] Ujai321: learning in a vacuum must be tough
[0:19:00] heldtheline: i mean, i think most of us are here for you, and not the game(s)
[0:19:07] Ujai321: you have to wear a suit
[0:19:12] Ujai321: cant be good for concentration
[0:19:16] cashthb: is fighter pilot a consideration? I heard it's really though
[0:19:19] jeffdmk: The important part of learning in a vacuum is learning to hold your breath
[0:19:51] Zuldak: i think the military cuts off at 30
[0:19:52] witchhobbit: why do we think wow is going to die? I feel like itâ€™s just been going on for so long, itâ€™s going to live foreva
[0:19:59] Zuldak: unless you have a specialization they need
[0:20:06] witchhobbit: forevaaaa
[0:20:13] Ujai321: so how are you feeling today? except for your sinuses
[0:20:19] saga_no: People think WoW is dying every pre-expac prepatch... LUL
[0:20:32] Zuldak: if runescape is still kicking, wow is going to be here forever
[0:20:35] cashthb: but what if you lose your stripper shirt?
[0:20:37] anker_jym: No offense, but "Hazel joining the military" is not on my bingo card
[0:20:49] gordastico: would you quit your job if you won the lottery?
[0:20:55] Zuldak: ...stripper shirt? did i miss something O.o
[0:20:57] witchhobbit: yeah I think Iâ€™ve just seen the hypothetical discussion a lot recently
[0:21:08] aerissune: You will have to do all cooking streams
[0:21:16] saga_no: I honestly think Hazel would make a good officer in the military
[0:21:20] Zuldak: I think people are talking about it because of the whole transition to microsoft
[0:21:24] kynlaeh: maybe you could be a professional cat sitter
[0:21:26] saga_no: But whether or not that is something she wants to do is another question
[0:22:31] whatsupwithnick: i had a dream the other day that my dad was helping me get ready to go compete on rupaul's drag race lol
[0:22:42] vampire_enthusiast: Hey Hazel, do you know if they did another name purge? In a levelling dungeon right now with a brand new healer just named Freddy
[0:22:55] Ujai321: i hate people who constantly ask if i did the thing they wanted me to do, it makes me want to do the thing less. unrelated, did you watch DInner in America already?
[0:23:08] witchhobbit: yeah itâ€™s scary right now
[0:23:31] Ujai321: nothing to apologize for. it's your loss, really Kappa
[0:23:39] gordastico: I kinda wish artisan workshops still existed, I would have loved to craft bricks for a living or something
[0:23:58] saga_no: They're still alive and kickin' in Japan
[0:24:08] jeffdmk: do you know anything about why some people remember dreams so much more then others?
[0:24:42] Ujai321: i will tell you right now, it is NOT cute for like 15 minutes. but it is very funny
[0:24:54] MaddiDJ4: if I had it my way Iâ€™d be a fiber artist. but Iâ€™m not terribly business minded and most people nowadays do that through Etsy shops and pattern designing
[0:25:37] gordastico: are there any new toys in the trading post?
[0:25:38] Ujai321: "do i have a tiara" is like asking a fish if they had scales
[0:25:56] Zuldak: has anyone else noticed egg prices going way up?
[0:26:10] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:26:18] cashthb: WutFace
[0:26:22] Ujai321: instead, have a point light source that is shining diretly into your eyes forever
[0:26:33] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[0:26:39] heldtheline: that should be a thumbnail for something, definitely
[0:26:41] cardfrek: i feel like i have a promising future as a medieval town crier
[0:27:04] witchhobbit: do you have narcissus? it can do so much itâ€™s nuts
[0:27:11] GreenArrowed: i would like to know bc i've had the most bananas dreams in the last few weeks
[0:27:17] MaddiDJ4: for me itâ€™s my medicine, it makes me remember almost any dream I have. makes the nights I forget to take it so peaceful
[0:27:36] GreenArrowed: yea etsy is rough
[0:27:51] GreenArrowed: unless you have a very specific niche
[0:28:01] cashthb: maybe it was hand crafted by that chinese child worker!
[0:28:10] gordastico: same as being a family restaurant having to compete with ghost kitchens :(
[0:28:13] MaddiDJ4: @greenarrowed id look at if youâ€™re taking any new medication. that might do it
[0:28:22] Ujai321: what if the light in your eyes isnt coming from outside...
[0:28:32] witchhobbit: those robes are so pretty
[0:28:54] witchhobbit: ghost kitchen? Iâ€™ve never heard of this term
[0:29:05] heldtheline: my dream would be a ghost kitchen-- a kitchen staffed by ghosts
[0:29:07] GreenArrowed: @MaddiDJ4 oh yes, my meds make me dream. they've just been more vivid recently and i haven't changed anything so it feels weird
[0:29:18] jeffdmk: comp stomp on tuesday
[0:29:23] wolfcloudchaser80: Maybe the eyes are reflecting something only the gnomes can see, and it's something the secret finding discord needs to be investigating.
[0:29:35] Zuldak: do a superbloom on an alt?
[0:29:42] cashthb: superbloom is like a billion
[0:29:47] GreenArrowed: the peafowl mount is soooo pretty
[0:29:58] Ujai321: why is there a murloc foot race
[0:30:34] cashthb: does that mean gnomes see better in the dark than other races?
[0:30:49] heldtheline: the eye-to-gnome ratio hazelShiny
[0:30:56] MaddiDJ4: couldnâ€™t remember whether the bloom was on the hour or not, had me scared it was work time Hazel hazelCry
[0:31:36] Ujai321: awesome
[0:32:42] cashthb: well lenses in general, it was more of a physics than  a bilogy thing here
[0:32:47] gordastico: are you going to stream your hc  journey?
[0:32:48] ImpatientLola: hello! its been a while since i watched the stream and i'm glad to be back :)
[0:32:50] saga_no: After my fantastic first attempt at Arena Skirmish yesterday; I queued one today (as Disco) and it was a mess....
[0:33:03] Ujai321: level 8? is it regular leveling speed, or accelerated?
[0:33:25] Ujai321: i'm impressed
[0:33:33] cashthb: by
[0:33:34] witchhobbit: I was just thinking about how badly I wanna play a troll hunter thru bfa
[0:33:39] kynlaeh: i taught human anatomy during my undergrad and we compared human eyes to cow eyes cuz they have special layer called the tapetum lucidum that was a turquoise iridescent layer and reflects light which was really pretty
[0:34:08] Ujai321: imagine they drop their biggest news dump yet, and it is on a day where you are sick
[0:34:16] heldtheline: the only wow news i'm hyped about is the tarot deck they're releasing later this year <3
[0:34:28] saga_no: Wait wait ... WoW Tarot?
[0:34:30] saga_no: SIgn me up
[0:34:37] Ujai321: you have to get your nephew for a baby video
[0:34:57] witchhobbit: seriously, take all my money, for a tarot deck
[0:34:58] Zuldak: TWW is supposed to come in like november right? Well they have 8 months for a season 4 and a prepatch...
[0:35:00] cashthb: maybe it's high time to expand your horizons, why limit yourself to wow news? you could do some political reporting too, it's almost usa election, gotta ride that hype tryin!
[0:35:00] heldtheline: yep, they announced it a few days ago; it's on wowhead and available for pre-order on amazon
[0:35:01] kynlaeh: it lets them see in really dim light where they would not be able to see without that special layer that we lack
[0:35:02] Ujai321: ...now i wonder how old a baby can be max, and when they become a toddler or whatever
[0:35:02] saga_no: Oh... here's to hoping my local Geek Stuff Store will import some
[0:35:12] saga_no: Cuz getting things off the Merch store is ...not easy
[0:35:18] witchhobbit: I donâ€™t even draw cards that much but I really love collecting some decks. the art is the best
[0:35:31] Ujai321: i thought you would say "i'm firmly against getting my nephew sick"
[0:35:41] GreenArrowed: @saga_no have you started your dnd game?
[0:35:46] Ujai321: *for a video"
[0:35:52] saga_no: @GreenArrowed I have, yeah :)
[0:36:07] cashthb: gotta get that immunity from somewhere
[0:36:20] saga_no: Cows can be scary
[0:36:22] Ujai321: 4 stomachs, man
[0:36:30] GreenArrowed: @saga_no nice, i've been thinking about finding a table, there's a game cafe near me
[0:36:34] vildusten: giraffes also have multiple stomachs!!
[0:36:40] 7thSaga: LUL cows
[0:36:44] saga_no: That long tongue of theirs is not fun when it's wrapped around your wrist and the cow is dragging your hand into its mouth
[0:36:46] cashthb: Cows can be delicious too!
[0:36:52] witchhobbit: cows are cute!
[0:37:10] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[0:37:18] saga_no: My half-brother's grandma had a small farm with cows so I got to experience them up-close as a kid
[0:37:28] jeffdmk: just like your gnome
[0:37:55] saga_no: @GreenArrowed My table is online and as such very flexible - which is nice
[0:38:08] Ujai321: my way to school when i was little led past a cow patch. one day, their fence was broken down, and they could just walk whereever. long story short, i have a lot of respect for things that can move whereever and are literally 20 times my weight
[0:38:12] cashthb: maybe you should something simpler. How about a quick I wanna be the boshy playtrough?
[0:38:13] anker_jym: My wife got excited one day when we were driving through a rural area one time and saw some cows. I had to rain on her parade and point out they were statues. No idea why someone had a bunch of cow statures
[0:38:31] GreenArrowed: "gain 10 lvls as a warlock, mage or paladin" don't mind if i do!
[0:39:46] Zuldak: it really is interesting to see how other people do their dragon races
[0:39:56] Zuldak: eveyone uses different techniques
[0:40:05] jeffdmk: why are you so negative about your dragon ridding skills you do the course really well?
[0:40:28] GreenArrowed: @anker_jym there are so many cow statues in wisconsin. the Kopps in Glendale have 12 in the back of their parking lot.
[0:41:03] anker_jym: Oh don't worry, there's plenty of real cows in the area too lol
[0:41:20] Zuldak: i would think land on victoria island would be too expensive for cows
[0:41:29] saga_no: See a cow while driving: "Mooo!" - see a horse while driving: "Pony!"
[0:41:46] GreenArrowed: nah, they're often hollow
[0:41:50] GreenArrowed: cast statues
[0:42:34] Ujai321: so it's just a cow covered in plaster?
[0:42:34] anker_jym: I should probably know the answer to this, but if you had a farm, would you rather raise food or livestock?
[0:42:43] 7thSaga: @saga_no i think horses go ''NYEEAH'' LUL or idk
[0:42:46] MaddiDJ4: so on the highway I drive every day there are some horse statues. but on Wednesday there was a runaway horse on the highway. itâ€™s ok, but definitely not what I was expecting to see
[0:43:09] cashthb: I mean.... livestock is kinda for most
[0:43:15] cashthb: you could have a fishery!
[0:43:18] saga_no: @7thSaga Oh I know - but whenever we pass a horse while out driving I'll whisper "PONNI!" (Pony in Norwegian)
[0:43:22] anker_jym: Oh I expected livestock, since you like animals
[0:43:47] cashthb: *...livestock is kinda *food*  for...
[0:44:11] kynlaeh: how big is moose now?
[0:44:13] 7thSaga: ohh LUL @saga_no
[0:44:28] kynlaeh: i think i saw the horse on the highway on the news lol
[0:44:28] saga_no: Y'all should come visit Norway and see the Moose statues...
[0:44:32] GreenArrowed: yea, cows don't care
[0:45:07] cashthb: early southpark had something similar if I reacall correctly, maybe it's a sign that you should start watching it
[0:46:10] cashthb: maybe you have rtx on again
[0:46:17] anker_jym: I have a gaming laptop, and I really need to dust it, but I'm not looking forward to taking the bottom off to spray compressed air
[0:46:30] 7thSaga: Hazel have you ever been to grand Portage? seeing the Witch Tree is kinda spooky LUL also a ncie hike up the mountain
[0:46:36] cashthb: yeah, those tots look like rt shadows
[0:46:59] jeffdmk: blizzard how dare you make me actually play the game
[0:47:17] cashthb: you could just buy a honot offhnad
[0:47:34] apheelia96: Good Afternoon!
[0:47:47] MoonTalon: Hey, sometimes you just gotta turn off the brain and grind lol
[0:47:52] vampire_enthusiast: vampire_enthusiast subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Hazel, Happy 6 months and I'm looking forward to seeing your War Within coverage, hoping you get into the Alpha which should be starting soonish
[0:47:52] Streamlabs: vampire_enthusiast just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:47:59] Ujai321: yeah man. you want to kill 97 boars. 97! how can you not go for 100 if you made it that far
[0:48:17] cashthb: it had no upgrade path
[0:48:35] jgbrit: Hey Hazel ðŸ‘‹
[0:48:37] cashthb: mb,
[0:48:39] ImpatientLola: what addon do you use for AH?
[0:48:48] cashthb: I meant the second, I didn't see it for some reason
[0:48:56] Zuldak: you completed it all
[0:48:59] Zuldak: youre goood
[0:50:45] saga_no: Fisherman's Friend come in a bajillion flavors too so I'm sure you'll find one you like
[0:50:49] saga_no: or at least they do here
[0:51:04] saga_no: I like the mint ones personally
[0:51:34] WhippWhapp: o/ Heya @HazelNuttyGames & chat... TGIF! Did a nine hour job yesterday with no breaks or lunch so to day I am CHILLAXIN! PogChamp
[0:51:39] jgbrit: I actually got the dreamseed mount today. Honestly I used one seed in another players seed. I got so lucky
[0:52:44] saga_no: Are there like flightstone boxes you can buy and send to your alts?
[0:52:45] jgbrit: Sorry one dewdrop.. I'm half asleep, just had a nap
[0:52:59] apheelia96: I got the masquerade masks
[0:52:59] itsparvati: gave self found a try last night. got to level 6 and got bored and remembered why i dont play classic
[0:53:00] anne42: had to stop watching yesterday because my dog wanted me to be with her. Dogs some first:)
[0:54:06] saga_no: They could do it like if you cap out on the flightstones on your main - you can spend the surplus on boxes and send those to alts ....
[0:54:08] itsparvati: itsparvati subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! oh to be 19 again
[0:54:08] Streamlabs: itsparvati just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:54:30] jgbrit: I only bought the mount. Saved some tender this month
[0:54:51] itsparvati: i wish i had a lap kitty with kira
[0:55:18] anker_jym: On a scale of 1 to 10, she's at least a 12
[0:55:33] tyrannara: Mine is nicknamed Tater Bug lol
[0:55:47] anne42: I dont normally like cats but yours seems really sweet
[0:55:49] itsparvati: only made sweeter as she ages
[0:55:57] Ujai321: just a lil guy
[0:56:09] murloc_kingkiller: any 10.2.6 leaks?
[0:56:10] itsparvati: i love animals
[0:56:13] itsparvati: i want them all
[0:56:24] itsparvati: if i ever had a farm.... there would be issues
[0:56:38] saga_no: O.o
[0:56:39] GreenArrowed: it's sooo pretty
[0:56:41] saga_no: Oh I am getting that mount for sure
[0:56:46] GreenArrowed: i love that it's a flying mount
[0:56:48] Zuldak: the sword is bigger than her!
[0:56:53] anker_jym: That's a fantastic mount
[0:56:59] Ujai321: ok, for real: if there was a thing in the shop to buy for like 50 tender now... would you?
[0:57:22] kynlaeh: i love those dresses but i cant find cloth pants that dont show on my priest and it drives me nuts
[0:57:34] Ujai321: if only you liked teal... wait
[0:57:38] murloc_kingkiller: those shoulder capes are the best thing theyve added to wow mogs
[0:57:53] jgbrit: The mount Is stunning
[0:58:12] cashthb: I like the returning shirt for emo mommy transmogs
[0:58:17] itsparvati: teal is an awesome color. matches my kitchen!
[0:58:20] RigzDigz: That pole arm was pretty pretty sweet
[0:58:27] eielwind: it really is majestic
[0:58:40] saga_no: It's not...
[0:58:44] saga_no: "its" would be correct
[0:58:48] jgbrit: I'm still sat on the love fox from last month I was a bit short for both
[0:58:53] dergNwolf: recently blizz can't figure it out either
[0:58:53] flautoamoroso: That peacock is magical!!!!
[0:58:54] Perkolate: yoooo sick mount
[0:58:57] jeffdmk: is that a new model?
[0:58:59] cashthb: it should, "it is something something colors"
[0:58:59] itsparvati: they could have gone bigger with tail
[0:59:05] dergNwolf: happens a lot that they get it wrong in shadowlands/dragonflight
[0:59:05] cashthb: *shouldn't
[0:59:07] itsparvati: maybe its a baby still
[0:59:08] toastgremlin: this mount is very beautiful
[0:59:08] murloc_kingkiller: yeah it's implies "it is"
[0:59:09] emmsnake: I hope it dragonrides
[0:59:11] Gurottesquex: Its so pretty
[0:59:18] mediocrity_squared: that would look nice dragonriding
[0:59:20] murloc_kingkiller: "its" would be correct
[0:59:23] lreddenn: look at that chicken
[0:59:25] GreenArrowed: that's what i was hoping
[0:59:34] Gurottesquex: Those colors are too cool
[0:59:47] jeffdmk: It is clearly built to add dragon riding
[0:59:49] jgbrit: Yayyyy
[0:59:50] flautoamoroso: It would have been so nice if the feathers displayed outward
[0:59:54] Terra___l: the dress is ugly cause no option for no trousers...
[1:00:04] itsparvati: kira stream time
[1:00:16] jgbrit: And by snack I mean I'm ordering Chinese. I've been craving it for weeks
[1:02:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Yay! Just saw the first chipmunk of the season. Winter is almost over!
[1:03:15] plainswalker75: That is one cute cat :3
[1:03:33] daws001: imagine if Kira just started playing
[1:04:03] Zindrassil: i keep waiting for her to jump on the keyboard...
[1:05:09] jgbrit: Don't get too comfortable Kira, you'll be scooped soon and you'll me maaad
[1:05:52] JustFrogging: what up
[1:06:12] jgbrit: Do you'll know what she needs, her own Herman miller
[1:06:30] saga_no: Good news; I logged in to double-check the pvp-ilvl thing, and discovered I could buy a neck and a ring - and now I'm high enough to queue Solo Shuffle later.
[1:06:35] saga_no: Let the Clownery Commence!
[1:06:47] heihenks: How's the hc playerbase now? Still active?
[1:07:16] JustFrogging: You are on my laptop like a happy chatty coworker while I paint WoW landscapes :D
[1:08:12] Zuldak: welp the blue news is out so no new blizz announcements
[1:08:22] Marmoh: It's crazy that white gear is exciting in HC haha
[1:09:03] Zuldak: what is your go to cough drop? Halls is a classic but fisherman's friend are the real hard stuff
[1:09:35] GattsuGaming: SO you probably know, vender has cheap 6 slot bags
[1:09:39] Zuldak: Fisherman friend packs a punch
[1:09:48] cashthb: I love 'em, I didn't see on in years tho
[1:09:51] eielwind: is fishermans friend a canadian thing? i never herad of it
[1:10:04] Zuldak: they sell them at fred meyers
[1:10:14] saga_no: @eielwind They've existed here in Norway since I were a kid
[1:10:26] silverstitcher: we have them in UK
[1:10:38] cashthb: nothings better than throwing in a pill and flushing it with some ice cold water in the summer heat
[1:10:56] Zuldak: does it imply that halls drops are... not gluten free?
[1:11:19] jeffdmk: I have a gluten free computer
[1:11:25] saga_no: There's also some legislation regarding what needs to be stated in terms of allergies and such in many European countries so that may also be a reason
[1:11:40] zendavid: hello everyone
[1:11:51] Zuldak: oh! i did clean my keyboard yesterday. I have no idea how hair keeps getting into it >.>
[1:12:29] MaddiDJ4: my stepmom has hashimotos, which is a gluten intolerance where she wonâ€™t end up in the hospital but sheâ€™ll feel real rough if she has it. so Iâ€™ve learned a lot about gluten free foods and foods that were always gluten free
[1:12:45] itsparvati: i commit the sin of eating at my desk often. keyboard cleaing happens regularly
[1:12:52] fizzleblast127: fizzleblast127 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[1:14:04] GreenArrowed: oh noooo
[1:14:06] zendavid: yesterday i picked up the battle pet  Blaise so nice
[1:14:25] GreenArrowed: these last percentages on my vicious mount are agonizing
[1:14:46] MaddiDJ4: between my step-momâ€™s gluten intolerance and my lactose intolerance my poor dad has a real rough time trying to feed us
[1:14:59] itsparvati: this weekends project... druid forms
[1:15:13] GreenArrowed: 5%
[1:15:21] GreenArrowed: and DPS queuing
[1:15:26] Zuldak: oh druid forms? Does that mean mage tower attempts for the werebear?
[1:15:28] itsparvati: almost there... you can do it!
[1:15:50] itsparvati: @Zuldak maybe not this weekend, i was thinking of the new DF ones i haven't unlocked yet
[1:16:48] Kilgharrah96: The Dreadlord tmog set in Retail WoW is now available - still waiting for The Dark Ranger General set :(
[1:16:57] alothea54: Thank you Hazel for talking about your sourdough, I started my own starter and have been making stuff. So delicious and fun.
[1:17:04] GreenArrowed: omg i forgot about separate weapon training
[1:17:10] GreenArrowed: vanilla was such a nightmare
[1:17:15] gordastico: 10 silver!?!?!?!? that is a FORTUNE
[1:17:35] beccabeethebug: *and* you have to deal with BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
[1:17:43] gordastico: + you get more skill in bows because you are a troll!
[1:17:53] Pathstrider: seems they put ash'adar mount from trading post onto store just now
[1:18:09] Zuldak: @itsparvati the rare drop mounts in the ED are a huge pain, especially the ash travel form thing
[1:19:45] GattsuGaming: Hi, So long time lurker, first time engaging may i offer my thoughts on wolf meat?
[1:20:31] GattsuGaming: Thank you. if it pleases you, you can attempt a run to Mulgore, ive done it before to Farm wolf meat and do soe green quests for cash and quest rewards.
[1:20:49] pebblesenn: pebblesenn subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:20:49] Streamlabs: pebblesenn just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:20:51] GattsuGaming: Yes, very true.
[1:21:14] Zindrassil: lol, last hardcore season i did troll starting area and then undead starting area before i did kultiran sailors quests :')
[1:21:17] pebblesenn: The HC convinced me to sub, love this content :)
[1:21:22] GattsuGaming: Sounds like a well thought out plan.
[1:21:22] gordastico: I mean if there is no danger of dying are you even alive?
[1:21:53] itsparvati: they stopped to hit on the new troll in the area
[1:22:07] HolliKitti: what about travelling to trisifal glades to kill the hounds for wolf meat and hides?
[1:22:41] vampire_enthusiast: As someone who has no interest whatsoever is playing anything Classic, it's so interesting to watch
[1:23:08] itsparvati: @vampire_enthusiast fun to watch, boring to do... as i found
[1:23:22] vampire_enthusiast: it's like a whole different game
[1:23:31] apheelia96: im trying to get that medallion in the cave and there is a line lol
[1:23:37] itsparvati: my plan was feral druid, but didnt get far enough
[1:23:40] saga_no: I'm watching this to psyche me up for Shuffle later (...I'll probably queue as Disco to rip the bandaid off, as it were.. )
[1:23:52] MaddiDJ4: @vampire_enthusiast classic content is 10/10 but Iâ€™m a retail fan all the way
[1:24:06] saga_no: I'm fully prepared to be yelled at
[1:24:42] saga_no: We've already established that at least half the chat is here for the chat and vibes - not necessarily for everything you happen to play
[1:24:43] fizzleblast127: You really should have "live to win" playing
[1:24:44] jgbrit: Hazel, most of us are probably here because we like you and would watch you paint a wall
[1:24:44] eielwind: i did what hazel does and made a blank chat tab lol
[1:24:54] gordastico: classic wow has some strange hypnotic rythm to it
[1:24:57] gordastico: in a good way
[1:25:03] vampire_enthusiast: It's mainly the tension of it for me, I do very poorly with lingering stress but love watching it
[1:25:04] saga_no: @eielwind Oh I have.. LUL
[1:25:11] itsparvati: i never played normal hardcore. what is a good level to make it too?
[1:25:14] jgbrit: Having said that I personally adore watching classic
[1:26:10] MaddiDJ4: @itsparvati further than you got on your last tooj
[1:26:12] Hulkhokie: i had to leave after 2 sharkbait runs the other day, wondering if you got it to drop this week?
[1:26:16] saga_no: @eielwind But I haven't been able to avoid the /say-messages on screen... sooo..... I'll still see those whenever people comment on my non-existent skills
[1:26:18] jgbrit: I've emptied my mains bank today. Make about 50k SeemsGood
[1:26:25] itsparvati: @MaddiDJ4 well i know that
[1:26:57] Hulkhokie: i miss the pre-cata original zones
[1:27:24] GattsuGaming: I agree.
[1:27:35] saga_no: So - ...if my only goal is to fill the mount bar in PvP - I can do whatever, right? Shuffle, 3s, BGs - they'll all contribute to the bar, if I understand it correctly?
[1:27:51] itsparvati: relaxing in the low zones, just wait
[1:27:58] saga_no: I'll worry about rating later... above 1k that is
[1:28:16] MrSonicgen: Afternoon.
[1:28:41] cashthb: @saga_no ranked ones
[1:28:57] saga_no: @cashthb Well... obviously...........
[1:29:02] jgbrit: Chinese take out ordered, I'm so hype. Hazel and great dinner. Bliss
[1:29:27] GattsuGaming: I agree boar.
[1:29:27] apheelia96: orange chicken
[1:29:43] GattsuGaming: lol, agree with that
[1:29:49] starshroudxoxo: Tiger, spider, chimera, bee, turtle, boar.
[1:30:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Boars are all about attitude.
[1:30:30] jgbrit: I love all the appetisers really, Sui Mai, satay chicken skewers, sweet and sour chicken or chow mein as the main
[1:30:42] kynlaeh: i got orange tofu once and it was good but i prefer my noodles or rice
[1:30:45] cashthb: boars are the most edible tho, maybe your character gets stuck with it on a deserted isle or something... gotta prepare for everything on hc!
[1:30:45] itsparvati: great now im hungry
[1:31:02] starshroudxoxo: I like chimera/bee and boar/ravager.
[1:31:07] bitshady: boars are great, early 'dash' ability and they eat about everything you throw at them :)
[1:31:11] kynlaeh: but near me the restaurant knows me and will make any meat dish with tofu for me which is sweet
[1:31:12] sibimi: oh my, the dreadlord regalia transmog set is in wow shop now :( was wishing for some other way of acquiring it
[1:31:15] raffle_nz: isn't there one or two rares in durotar that are good to tame?
[1:31:25] itsparvati: moved to a new area, having found MY chinese place yet
[1:31:25] heldtheline: I'm basic, I used to just order like a lb of fried rice, love that stuff
[1:31:30] raffle_nz: or am i thinking of barrens?
[1:31:37] eielwind: they just added new cosmetic sets to teh shop
[1:31:53] itsparvati: turtles are good
[1:32:01] itsparvati: i used turtle back in those days
[1:32:10] jgbrit: I'm using the frogs from Ardenweald that have the masks. I absolutely love them
[1:32:31] kynlaeh: yk ive never had pho
[1:33:38] kynlaeh: i end up getting banh mi typically if i get viatnamese
[1:33:44] kynlaeh: i should venture out

[1:34:41] Forestgrunt: Heey
[1:34:45] wolfcloudchaser80: I miss the pad thai we used to get in California. One of very few things I miss from there.
[1:34:48] apheelia96: thats the stream I came from just a little sooner lol
[1:35:05] Kunozah: @apheelia96 same lol
[1:35:20] itsparvati: what was that?
[1:35:24] itsparvati: hmmmmm
[1:35:34] cashthb: how about a panther?
[1:35:47] kynlaeh: have you tried pad see ew from a thai place? they have really those big flat rice noodles that i love
[1:36:33] itsparvati: i did enjoy classic hunter pets. i will never go back to having to carry arrows again. i refuse!
[1:36:40] plainswalker75: Pad see ew rules
[1:36:54] GreenArrowed: carrying and BUYING arrows, yuck
[1:36:58] kynlaeh: its my fave noodle dish of the them all
[1:37:16] GreenArrowed: i do miss feeding my pets
[1:38:18] itsparvati: when choosing a pet, remember food types too
[1:38:41] gordastico: are ssf servers separate or is it something you opt in like trial of iron?
[1:38:51] itsparvati: fruit pets are harder for self found i would imagine
[1:38:53] gordastico: or whatever that thing in season of mastery was called
[1:39:13] evilmortyrulestheworld: bear best bet since it also a tank pet
[1:39:28] mediocrity_squared: is self found an extension of SoD?  will you have runes on self found?
[1:39:32] GreenArrowed: i forgot about the tigers here
[1:39:35] ivashkov92: howâ€™s self found going?? ðŸ˜ƒ
[1:39:41] GreenArrowed: i thought maybe you wouldn't see a lion until cross roads
[1:40:02] itsparvati: oooohhh a green. she fancy
[1:40:08] KushDaddy03: Green armor at level 8? Legend
[1:40:14] ivashkov92: Is Hunter the class youâ€™d  recommend? I wanna give it a try!
[1:40:47] itsparvati: pet classes solo much easier at lower levels
[1:41:08] AnarchyMoose: priest is actually surprisingly easy too
[1:41:12] saga_no: I have a soft spot for druids in Classic
[1:41:20] ivashkov92: Gotcha.. Iâ€™ll give either those a try ðŸ™‚
[1:41:50] itsparvati: ok fine, hazel convinced me ill keep going.. level 7 here i come
[1:42:21] gordastico: the wooden sword of doom LUL
[1:43:36] Perkolate: this is it...
[1:43:37] KushDaddy03: Oh nooo
[1:43:50] KushDaddy03: Phew
[1:44:43] Marmoh: HC has a really strong zone presence, which is really fun
[1:45:58] itsparvati: kiting takes more arrows, thats for rich hunters
[1:46:36] DennisTried: easiest 3 silvers of your life
[1:47:09] itsparvati: self found makes other players feel like rude npcs that steal your kills
[1:48:02] TotallyNotRaien: what does self found actually mean? im out of the loop
[1:49:22] anker_jym: I'm back! Looks like we're not dead yet, this is good
[1:49:32] averageteacup: killing the critter rabbit for its leather ... that's cold :D
[1:50:05] jeffdmk: The way you play hc the main challenge is patience
[1:50:50] tunamako: watcha drinking?
[1:50:50] IAmScarlett__: hello hi hai
[1:51:02] tunamako: yummo
[1:51:55] raffle_nz: isn't that enough silver to buy a bag froma vendor?
[1:52:42] Zuldak: oh there is a new transmog set on the in game shop... dreadlord
[1:53:10] saga_no: Out of sheer curiosity, I found a video ranking the easiest to hardest classes/specs in Shuffle, and ...well........ I've not made it easy for myself LUL
[1:53:22] jack_vanhelsing: what's up, Hazel?
[1:53:57] jack_vanhelsing: just waiting to get my desktop comp back up so I can play some more WoW.
[1:55:26] DennisTried: your cat is being an absolute icon right now
[1:55:41] GreenArrowed: @saga_no what are you playing, disc?
[1:56:18] saga_no: @GreenArrowed Shady Disco - ...I *prefer* Shadow, but I'm thinking I should queue as Disco to get shorter queues (and learn how to play Disco the hard way)
[1:56:50] saga_no: Disco is ranked as "easy" (not 'very easy') so that's fine - but Shadow is ranked as "hard" ...sooo..... there is that
[1:57:21] saga_no: Holy is the "very easy" spec for Shuffle, apparently, so I might just set that up as well
[1:57:38] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[1:58:06] cashthb: @saga_no I think disco is easy compared to other healer, and shadow is to other dps; there isn't a healing dh or warrior so...
[1:58:13] AnarchyMoose: ITS THE FINAL COUNTDOWN
[1:58:44] heldtheline: self-found in retail would be interesting, considering how complex professions are. you could be your own self-sustaining ecosystem with enough hard work
[1:58:48] saga_no: The very easy healer according to this video was Resto Druid because of playstyle - but I've never played Resto Druid so I have no idea
[1:59:13] saga_no: ...does make me wanna level a druid and spec it Resto to see, though......
[2:00:06] Marmoh: What were you doing in 2004 when WoW came out? I was 5 years old lol
[2:00:12] saga_no: @cashthb They split it into melee and ranged, and for ranged Shadow is harder than some other classes because of the lack of mobility and having to juggle several things at once to do decent damage
[2:00:35] apheelia96: my god your young

[2:01:19] saga_no: In 2004 I dated a dude who played WoW so I knew about the game, but never tried it myself
[2:01:23] gordastico: age is just a number (until your knees start creaking)
[2:01:58] mrsrockguru: I was 37yrs old,  I started WoW just before TBC came out, I'm now 57 yrs now, and still playing.  evenin @HazelNuttyGames and chat
[2:02:01] apheelia96: Im going to be 47 on Monday BibleThump
[2:02:21] apheelia96: ty but I feel so old lol
[2:02:22] GreenArrowed: @apheelia96 aw, my 38th is on wednesday <3
[2:02:23] cashthb: I think druid is "easy" cause you either heal or spam cyclone, on priest you should deal damaga, and acutally have to put some tought into when you're ccing someone
[2:02:32] GreenArrowed: happy almost twin birthdays
[2:02:33] MaddiDJ4: @gordastico instructions unclear. my knees have been giving me problems since middle school
[2:02:50] apheelia96: @GreenArrowed happy almost bday to you
[2:02:51] cashthb: learning disc is way more worthwhile for a newbie
[2:03:01] wolfcloudchaser80: I transitioned from Everquest to WoW on the very day WoW launched. Still have that same main.
[2:03:17] saga_no: I
[2:03:22] apheelia96: I wanna try streaming but I feel like im maybe to old for it
[2:03:28] saga_no: I'll turn 40 this year - am I considered "older"? LUL
[2:03:29] AnarchyMoose: nah not me, im not going to get older
[2:03:48] GreenArrowed: i think i gained a new appreciation of older women when i moved to new york and met the older west village ladies who just talk loud and do what they want. inspiration.
[2:03:57] Suktramkara: I see online is not big
[2:04:01] MaddiDJ4: @apheelia96 may I point you to Wow Grandma, youâ€™re never to old to start somethinf
[2:04:03] apheelia96: I have watched WOWgrandma lol
[2:04:05] heldtheline: Gotta watch some Golden Girls; I aspire to be Dorothy when I get older
[2:04:20] apheelia96: lol
[2:04:28] wowfreshman: Iâ€™m 75. still play.
[2:04:45] saga_no: I mean ...mentally I'm still 19.... LUL
[2:04:51] jgbrit: I return, are you on until noon Hazel?
[2:05:12] Docfeelbad: I'm sure the audience of this stream skews a bit older, this is one of the more mature streams on twitch
[2:05:16] McScooterson: @jgbrit most days now
[2:05:17] jeffdmk: The alternative to getting older is not great

[2:05:23] mcxoney: ik im not in a place to complain here but im turning 18 in few months im so so scared of becoming an adult
[2:05:40] apheelia96: @MaddiDJ4 wanna know whats funny!? WowGrandma streams too late for me LUL
[2:05:57] jgbrit: Any near deaths while I've been gone LUL
[2:06:01] Marmoh: LOL
[2:06:18] saga_no: @mcxoney I have wonderful news for you; your brain is still developing until you hit your mid-twenties ...so arguably you'll only be an "adult" on paper for a few years yet :)
[2:06:22] jgbrit: Hellgrave would be proud of you
[2:06:24] jeffdmk: you would be fine for a triple pull
[2:06:28] GreenArrowed: @apheelia96 she's up til 3-5 am for me!
[2:06:47] InfiniFiasco: hey are you getting dreadlord regalia set?
[2:07:06] cashthb: what about a quadruple pull?
[2:07:24] mcxoney: @saga_no didnt know that thanks ^^
[2:07:33] anker_jym: Ah yes, my Jaina Proudmoore transmog set is finally available
[2:07:34] apheelia96: oof that medallion guy in the cave almost killed me
[2:07:39] Marmoh: Hazel walking by a peacebloom. What dimension is this?
[2:07:56] saga_no: @mcxoney Besides... I still don't feel like a grownup, and I'm 39
[2:07:57] jgbrit: You know when you order *that* much food and you're opening it all like NotLikeThis
[2:08:36] jgbrit: Yeah I'm currently preparing dinner for tomorrow now lol
[2:08:37] mcxoney: @saga_no i guess being "grownup" is a matter of prespective isnt it
[2:08:39] GreenArrowed: @saga_no same - i never asked to be an adult with sponsibilities
[2:08:52] apheelia96: the amount of rice some places give me is insane
[2:09:17] saga_no: @mcxoney Yep - but the best part of being an "adult" is that you get adult money, that you can spend on whatever you like (..in addition to the boring stuff like rent and utilities that is)
[2:09:26] DennisTried: one time i greeted wowgrandma with "wussup gam gams, how you gamin'?" and she had the most polite, formal response. such a lovely ol' lady
[2:09:35] saga_no: I've bought myself more fun stuff like LEGO and plushies as an adult than I ever owned as a child
[2:09:41] InfiniFiasco: @anker_jym they gave Jaina a dreadlord skin in HoTs LuL
[2:09:51] GreenArrowed: she's so ssweet
[2:10:13] jgbrit: Is wow grandma still streaming R druid keys?
[2:10:18] GreenArrowed: @apheelia96 leftover rice is so good tho
[2:10:19] Kunozah: WoWGrandma is wonderful
[2:10:29] GreenArrowed: keys and raid i think?
[2:10:39] Kunozah: @jgbrit she streams every night
[2:10:39] Docfeelbad: any fun march plans?
[2:10:47] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm 43, my partner is a bit older than me, and yet we have stuffed animals living all over the house. And they all have names.
[2:10:52] mcxoney: @saga_no that sounds really fun besides rent stuff ofc :)
[2:11:00] jeffdmk: That is 18s you get to spend on training
[2:11:12] kynlaeh: hazel whatâ€™s your fav emergency chocolate?
[2:11:14] GreenArrowed: that's how i feel about my funkos
[2:11:16] jgbrit: @kunozah bless her heart she's so lovely
[2:11:19] GreenArrowed: i have pops everywhere
[2:11:31] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 YES. My biggest plushies were gifts from Hubby; the biggest of the bunch is a 3ft long pink unicorn
[2:11:33] Kunozah: @jgbrit she really is, I love her <3
[2:12:08] kynlaeh: huh never heard of an oh henry
[2:12:09] saga_no: @mcxoney Becoming adult on paper isn't AS bad once you consider the potential :)
[2:12:27] itsparvati: oh henry is old ppl candy
[2:12:44] jeffdmk: true
[2:12:49] GreenArrowed: it's not like it's worthers
[2:13:06] kynlaeh: is it similar to a payday?
[2:13:17] heldtheline: They don't make Oh Henry in America anymore actually, not since 2019.
[2:13:35] GreenArrowed: peanuts caramel fudge chocolate
[2:13:36] itsparvati: im a kitkat girl all the way
[2:13:42] anker_jym: @infinifiasco I didn't know that, that's hilarious lol
[2:13:42] apheelia96: what level do we get a pet?
[2:13:55] GreenArrowed: 10 is the pet quest
[2:14:01] kynlaeh: ahh ok so payday plus chocolate
[2:14:03] jgbrit: I would love to try one of those Canadian chocolate things you have just without the coconut
[2:14:04] Kunozah: I used to collect candy wrappers (Idk why I just did) and I had some oh henry wrapers from Canada when I went up there but they got thrown away because my ex thought the bag of candy wrappers was trash x_x
[2:14:05] kynlaeh: essentially
[2:14:12] ivashkov92: Reeseâ€™s all the way
[2:14:13] GreenArrowed: sugar is so painful
[2:14:20] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no We've been collecting critters that we've seen in real life. We just got a badger since we saw one of those for the first time on our last road trip. We named him Carl, since we were in Carlsbad Caverns Nat'l Park.
[2:14:22] itsparvati: LOL i guess if i have to grow emotionally....
[2:14:22] ivashkov92: or a  snickers
[2:14:26] apheelia96: @GreenArrowed cool ty
[2:14:32] jgbrit: Yeah that's the one
[2:14:50] conksalot: I miss Coffee Crisp from living in Canada. But yeah, the older you get the harder processed food are on you.
[2:14:52] cardbross: what's hilarious about the Canada vs US candy differences is that it's still mostly made by Hersheys or Mars Corp in both countries
[2:14:58] heldtheline: i love buckeyes, all that chocolate peanut buttery goodness
[2:14:59] GreenArrowed: chocolate bars are too sweet for me, i buy extra dark baking chocolate to nibble on
[2:15:00] AmiYuy: Woah! That's extreme!
[2:15:00] McScooterson: are you allergic to chocolate now?
[2:15:02] apheelia96: I have that addon that speaks the quest text to me
[2:15:07] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Ahh, nice :) Yeah - Hubby and I have a couple of WWF plushies.
[2:15:08] kynlaeh: i had a nanaimo bar when i visited a friend in windsor and i thought it was quite pleasant
[2:15:26] DennisTried: unsalted almonds are a great remedy for a sugar rush
[2:15:55] Docfeelbad: we need a quarterly sweets box
[2:16:33] apheelia96: I want a mount more than I want a pet lol
[2:16:40] sence_00: there are some rare spawns here that are real bait
[2:16:49] jgbrit: Have you tried a dragons bg yet? I'm a dragons main
[2:17:12] cashthb: how about carrot cake?
[2:17:59] cashthb: it waws random
[2:18:18] sence_00: were there supposed to be more promo announcements today? I saw the twitch prime thing earlier in the week but thought there was a blue post with more
[2:18:53] sence_00: just 10.2.6 looming
[2:19:10] cardbross: how does selffound work with mailing items/having mail returned?
[2:19:18] cardbross: can you use the mail as a bank in this mode?
[2:19:30] Perkolate: did we already talk about a previous trading post mount being in the cash shop now?
[2:20:35] anker_jym: Did you hear about the epic drop in SoD from the PvP event that requires a player to be lvl 125 to loot?
[2:22:37] GreenArrowed: as she does
[2:22:48] itsparvati: made it to darnassus! ill just chill here a bit. i miss my tree home
[2:22:52] jgbrit: This kitty cat will be fuming lol
[2:23:07] saga_no: At least she didn't hiss this time
[2:23:12] sence_00: you two are sooooo sweet
[2:23:30] tunamako: cuuuute cat
[2:23:42] saga_no: That hiss was *loud* - the mic picked it up from all the way back there
[2:25:07] jgbrit: Is Kira 8 now Hazel?
[2:25:20] cardbross: bagspace is an income multiplier
[2:25:30] jgbrit: Omg 10. I'm way out
[2:25:42] McScooterson: tbf, I think she turned 8 twice
[2:25:43] itsparvati: oh so she is losing her sight early, poor sweetheart
[2:26:00] itsparvati: thought she was older
[2:26:28] cashthb: but why was it wet? just give it a towel
[2:26:55] Marmoh: Can confirm I used all my sticky glue
[2:28:02] jgbrit: How about a nice trip to SV HeyGuys
[2:28:30] averageteacup: I remember one time a player asked if they can follow me around, i kill they skin :D
[2:28:36] dicemeister23: Imagine you die taming your first pet
[2:28:50] jgbrit: Get something blue and call it Hellgrave ðŸ˜‚
[2:29:01] Marmoh: That's where the sticky glue comes in
[2:29:01] apheelia96: would be sad but also funny
[2:29:11] McScooterson: did a prediction already happen today?
[2:29:27] itsparvati: i think why im finding this boring is im a lame druid until 20 when i get cat form
[2:29:40] averageteacup: can you tame a Kul'tiran?
[2:30:18] anker_jym: I have to do the Barrow Den quests in Teldrassil tonight. I'm a little stressed lol
[2:30:30] jgbrit: Don't do it
[2:31:02] RosaBrand: No traps yet? Wouldn't explosive trap make things easier?
[2:31:13] Teriser: lost my first HC character in those dens
[2:31:37] anker_jym: Because I'm a completionist when it comes to quests....again, I must enjoy pain when it comes to HC. I'm probably gonna try to overlevel
[2:31:46] dicemeister23: Hazel 2 months ago I came back to wow and you suggested I start in the Emerald Dream zone. Today I have finished it with rep 20 and mounts! I also nearly finished forbidden reach and Zaralek caverns :)
[2:32:03] cardbross: I feel like if I were doing HC I would try to skip Banethil Barrow Dens.  That place is a deathtrap in all gamemodes
[2:32:46] Teriser: lost another character to defias pillagers, I make bad choices :D
[2:33:02] anker_jym: @cardbross It's even a deathtrap in Retail. Nothing is a deathtrap in Retail!! Lol
[2:33:09] jgbrit: I can't get my head round Forbidden reach. There's nobody there, all I can find is dailies and as for the vault, I'm stumped
[2:33:34] kynlaeh: i lost my first hardcore character forgetting that in classic you cant blink backwards while walking back so i blinked forward and pulled a bunch of mobs it was sad
[2:33:54] kynlaeh: and i killed my partners character while doing it lol
[2:33:56] cardbross: time to grind boars for leather, sounds like
[2:34:46] Marmoh: mottled boar is such a random adjective to put
[2:34:50] jgbrit: Yeah the rares deck you
[2:34:55] KyleEverett: the peacock mount ate into so much of my tendies reserve
[2:34:57] jgbrit: Deck me anyway
[2:35:11] AnarchyMoose: i generally like the female troll animations but the bow animations are a little meh to me
[2:35:19] anker_jym: So Hazel, are you excited for 2032 when Shadowlands Classic launches?
[2:35:22] cashthb: you can also treasure hunt and look for those venture co gobos if you really want forbidden reach content
[2:35:43] KyleEverett: in classic I think male trolls have my favorite bow animation
[2:36:18] ivashkov92: Thoughts on this month trading post?
[2:36:22] AnarchyMoose: i think its the fact that female trolls dont draw the bow all the way back before firing
[2:36:24] Marmoh: Cata was my first proper expac!
[2:36:28] itsparvati: i didnt like cata either
[2:36:38] jgbrit: They have to make cata to get to Legion, the best candidate for classic imo
[2:36:39] Arabany: @anker_jym Earlier:) More like 2028:)
[2:36:43] itsparvati: it was a filler xpac for me
[2:36:46] cashthb: jokes on you cata classic will be the biggest thing ever, it will probably flat out kill retail
[2:36:51] lreddenn: i did the same
[2:36:55] m1lkman10: I wish they would release mounts on the trading post a little less frequently
[2:37:01] itsparvati: MoP gets us too close to just being retail
[2:37:03] dicemeister23: classic mop would be so fun... I want to farm again lol
[2:37:18] Teriser: I might actually try MoP classic, missed that expac entirely and I hear it was good
[2:37:19] heldtheline: I've never played any version of Classic but MoP Classic could get me; I miss my farm :(
[2:37:20] AnarchyMoose: i wish mounts were the completion reward more often
[2:37:32] KyleEverett: I tend to buy flying mounts.
[2:37:41] cashthb: as if the farm would no longer be in a game...
[2:37:45] McScooterson: the pup that followed us to wod
[2:37:46] kynlaeh: i mean i first played in cata with my dad and grandpa so i will be playing it with them, we used to do game days and bring our computers together and sit in the same room and play
[2:37:49] itsparvati: mix a garrison with a farm, im there
[2:38:13] cardbross: honestly, if we're revisiting post-Cata stuff, I wanna know what's up at the class order halls since we left them
[2:38:13] dicemeister23: I would be happy with another farm LOL but I want it to be as peaceful as Halfhill
[2:38:21] heldtheline: Most of us can't afford real homes; fake homes would be a nice gesture
[2:38:32] cashthb: the garrison did have farm!
[2:38:33] Marmoh: I get so excited when people mention they play wow with their parents. That sounds so... nice haha
[2:38:33] apheelia96: I used to love pets but there is an over abundance of them now. Not as special
[2:38:34] itsparvati: @heldtheline why must you say such true things
[2:38:53] kynlaeh: iâ€™m excited and now my partner is going to join, he only started in dragon flight cuz i talked him into it
[2:38:53] cashthb: what's up with all this farm missinformation?
[2:39:07] jgbrit: Shame I can't pass you the bone from my spare rib for moose through the screen
[2:39:10] itsparvati: i still enjoy pet battles, its wow pokemon. must get them all
[2:39:15] averageteacup: @dicemeister23 sometimes i go to Halfhill just to stand there, enjoy the place, the music in the inn is funny too :D
[2:39:28] apheelia96: I feel like I have too many that I never pull out. poor little guys are neglected
[2:39:45] itsparvati: i want a new pet dungeon, have they given up on those?
[2:40:11] apheelia96: I want a Chihuahua
[2:40:24] itsparvati: thats sad. it was fun
[2:40:48] kynlaeh: my grandpa is 78 and is looking at streaming in retirement cuz heâ€™s bored and i told him everyone would prolly love to watch a 78 yo play a rogue at 2200 in arenas lol
[2:40:49] cardbross: I continue to think making pet battles available on the mobile app is a slam dunk idea
[2:40:56] cashthb: they also prolly suck, like have you ever tried using Stormwing? it's like an Ikky but with not even half the damage
[2:41:09] itsparvati: @cardbross i dont understand why they havent yet
[2:41:36] itsparvati: pvp pet battles on my phone..... please blizzard
[2:41:39] cardbross: I have to believe it was in the conversation when Rumble was being developed
[2:41:44] apheelia96: I would play them more if you could pet battle on an app
[2:42:08] Arcoh_: figure out how to monetize it and they'd 100% make it
[2:42:28] heihenks: The fact that there's still achievements for 5000 pvp pet battle wins... how are we supposed to get that
[2:42:35] itsparvati: always the bottom line, its a business after all
[2:42:37] Arcoh_: never sleep
[2:42:41] Arcoh_: only pet battle
[2:42:45] cashthb: rewarding would be difficult yeah
[2:42:54] apheelia96: oh yeah dont want it required
[2:43:05] dicemeister23: But dont you all have phones?
[2:43:09] jgbrit: I'm so excited for the hearthstone even in wow
[2:43:21] itsparvati: the npc pet battles i could see not having on app, you need to go to them in game. but pvp is instanced
[2:43:51] KyleEverett: I haven't played rumble, wish they had made an official pc port.
[2:44:19] AnarchyMoose: didnt hearthstone come out on pc first?
[2:44:26] itsparvati: i hate playing hearthstone on my phone
[2:44:49] itsparvati: too many top decks require high apm
[2:44:54] cashthb: it was pc first, it was expansion 3 when mobile came out
[2:45:14] saga_no: Hearthstone was PC first - but only by like a month or so, afaik
[2:45:50] itsparvati: shaman is hard?
[2:45:55] itsparvati: thought they were giga
[2:45:59] GreenArrowed: i don't even remember how to play vanilla shammy
[2:46:08] Arcoh_: man, hearthstone beta and first few expansions was such a vibe.
[2:46:10] GreenArrowed: they're swuishy
[2:46:12] apheelia96: oooh money is gonna be a pain in this mode of wow hazelYikes
[2:46:12] jonotee01: You know about the hearthstone anniversary mount
[2:46:26] GreenArrowed: yes the totem quest is rough, and survivability is low
[2:46:40] jgbrit: I tried shaman I'm regular classic. I found them massively boring. Luckily I love them in retail
[2:47:09] heihenks: Meanwhile shammy was the only class that I got to 60 in hc
[2:47:23] KyleEverett: you know what Blizzard could add that I'd by for 1000 tenders, a leg item that works with the various dresses.
[2:47:32] jgbrit: I'm still preying for a mage healer in retail. That'd be my main in a heartbeat
[2:47:34] KyleEverett: yeah
[2:47:43] McScooterson: shoot, i'd pay actual money for that
[2:48:15] jeffdmk: do you want them to let us run around pantsless?
[2:48:19] jgbrit: @mcscooterson HeyGuys HeyGuys
[2:48:29] itsparvati: there is a couple pants that are basically a thong that goes with those side cuts
[2:48:30] kynlaeh: i found the best legs so far for those dresses are the love witch pants bc they donâ€™t show the skirt under the dress and you only see a tiny bit of them
[2:48:32] heldtheline: we have hi-def undies now, there's no reason why we must wear pants
[2:49:34] KyleEverett: given some races can even pick the colors of their underwear...
[2:49:39] itsparvati: i would imagine it would just be a flag check. if chest mod enabled, then leg slot disable option is available
[2:50:02] 21Khal: Did anyone tell to jump back in between shots?
[2:50:06] kynlaeh: i think i was using the mage weave pants before or at least i think theyâ€™re called that
[2:50:21] cashthb: I can pick the color of my underwear too. am I a wow character?
[2:50:36] McScooterson: @cashthb what if no
[2:50:40] GreenArrowed: so fast
[2:51:09] 21Khal: Oh well, not need to kite anymore, you got your pet :D
[2:51:28] MagicPants1414: hardcore!! nice hazel!
[2:52:08] GrieverCleaver: what kind of pet are you thinking about getting?
[2:52:12] jeffdmk: first ever completing a quest the turn i got it
[2:52:23] Spunkkete: I hope you feel better Hazel :)
[2:53:27] Octopixy1971: BB Hazel
[2:53:30] Lee57King: bye bye
[2:53:30] apheelia96: bye bye see ya tomorrow
