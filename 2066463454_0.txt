[0:14:45] muneplays: DH only thing thats missing is that they gave disarm to it DH aswell xd
[0:14:53] Skyle_win: i think dh can be easily cced if you play mage lock - but i might be wrong^^
[0:14:54] ekologiisk: dh damage and outlaw survival
[0:14:55] Cyber_guy: high rating ROGUE, low rating DH
[0:15:38] Malte_L: if almost every game is damp and blue bar and the dh does 30k more dps then ofc dh comes out on top more often then not
[0:15:48] Esotraz: Dh fear Kinda meh but yes i agree class is dumb
[0:16:02] darkHPH: Rogues in every arena comp no?
[0:16:18] Mckriminal: and dh is the class that dies that least in shuffle I think and that says alot

[0:18:21] Cyber_guy: @benyo1989 bist du nicht der von damil damals :D
[0:18:23] Brunhity: the last patch what happened just fucked outlaw more
[0:18:28] Brunhity: like increased hp armor etc
[0:18:31] benyo1989: @Cyber_guy LUL

[0:19:28] Erow_fr: Do you really hit you "6" an "7" binds on keyboard ? Or it's bind on your mouse ?
[0:19:41] darkHPH: Healer is unfun in PVP and in m+ they are currently dropping them in MDI so XD
[0:19:41] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[0:19:46] skystepx: @naxiuuz dafq are u talkin about

[0:19:57] Malte_L: back then you were 9years old Kappa
[0:20:13] skystepx: ye
[0:20:13] foe____: @Whaazz How long back are we talking about?
[0:20:17] sqsitv: guys whats a good 3s comp for arms warr?
[0:20:20] lazaroonpc: 1mn 30 cd trinket
[0:20:22] Skyle_win: just more class identity
[0:20:30] Skyle_win: everybody has everything now cause of pve
[0:20:31] venturejr: Not swap
[0:20:31] Moobot: Don't forget to follow my Twitter to see when I go live! https://twitter.com/Whaazz
[0:20:40] Brunhity: ye ofc there is too much micro cc, also the root/fear break buff is insanely bad for the game aswell
[0:20:40] Skyle_win: more spells =/= more fun
[0:21:00] cxar2202: @Whaazz thats why classic is superior. Retail has become WAAAY too polluted and complicated
[0:21:00] Brunhity: like even on warrior when uve the 200% more for ur fear to break
[0:21:04] Brunhity: u kill ppl in fear
[0:21:05] Cyber_guy: or rely on critluck so they overlap cds out of panic
[0:21:05] SmokiieTV: remove cloak pvp talent
[0:21:05] Brunhity: like bruh
[0:21:10] skystepx: @naxiuuz Waga is just a troll but he is a good guy overall
[0:21:10] Brunhity: so much aids in the game
[0:21:13] Skyle_win: remove cloak immunity - remove mobility for melees, nerf caster dmg
[0:21:15] Skyle_win: win at life
[0:21:26] Skillfall: remove 2x bop
[0:21:28] Esotraz: Remove cheat death and just have elusiveness
[0:21:30] sqsitv: @Whaazz whats a good 3s comp for arms warr?
[0:21:33] foe____: @Whaazz How long back are you talking about with how the game used to be less defensive and mobile? When do you think WoW went down wrong path?
[0:21:34] Glotai: @Skyle_win mobility for a lot of classes, some casters are disgusting too
[0:21:49] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Whaazz
[0:21:50] willythenewb: immo aura dispel
[0:21:51] Skyle_win: ye i play main mage and i feel mage has too much mobility for sure
[0:21:54] Skyle_win: its so troll
[0:22:04] supreemx: with the amount of movement and escape that rogue has, cheat death has to go
[0:22:05] Skyle_win: to have a mobility duel vs a warr - like what is that logic.
[0:22:11] Glotai: @Skyle_win yea and if a melee connect, just nova them
[0:22:12] SmokiieTV: i personally think rogue needs their deff's the cloak pvp talent is abit random tho
[0:22:17] Glotai: blast wave or one of the 100 other
[0:22:24] skystepx: ig i remember right, maybe i do not you started that shit no? @naxiuuz
[0:22:28] Justmexy: when is AWC NA/Europe Finals?
[0:22:34] Esotraz: Cdr on rog should also just be gone

[0:23:27] Supalapahar: What do we do with bald points
[0:23:30] cxar2202: @Whaazz thats why classic is superior. Retail has become WAAAY too polluted and complicated sadly
[0:23:41] foe____: @Whaazz How long back are you talking about with how the game used to be less defensive and mobile? When do you think WoW went down wrong path?
[0:23:43] sqsitv: @Whaazz whats a good 3s comp for arms warr?
[0:23:43] itsrikodeine: balding
[0:23:48] nijo_3: Do you think if they buff healers maybe CC is important again?
[0:23:51] Esotraz: Never add tts please
[0:23:54] skystepx: @Whaazz Ogge do TTS for Waga AYO
[0:24:04] cxar2202: @Whaazz the only problem about classic is the raiding. u are forced to raid too much for pvp
[0:24:08] Esotraz: Dont give him tts
[0:24:17] Skyle_win: ye its a bit troll also
[0:24:20] Cyber_guy: imo state of pvp is rly good now , there were times you couldnt play certain specs or classes
[0:24:26] Skyle_win: retail is good, yeah
[0:24:29] Supalapahar: @whaazz are u going to try cataclysm?
[0:24:30] Skyle_win: nothing compares to i
[0:24:32] d1vbno: Kappa
[0:24:40] Lovelesstv: retail would be nice without demon hunters
[0:24:42] Glotai: i had 2 shuffle queues 2 min each. was insane

[0:24:47] Biznid: yeah i play retail bcs its something new, i wouldnt be able to paly wraith for a month straight
[0:24:48] ceookz: balance heals pls
[0:24:49] lazaroonpc: if a new player is trying the game out classic is a lot easier tho
[0:24:50] drakovics97: amen @lovelesstv
[0:24:50] antoxdd: i dont know if there are actually ppl who enjoy current meta, 10min games resto druid meta

[0:25:08] cxar2202: the gameplay is annoying though. everybody has a quintillion defensives everybody has a gazillion mobility abiltilies
[0:25:15] willythenewb: true, dh needs to go
[0:25:17] Skyle_win: just look at how fun the games were to watch in the AWC compared to bfa games e.g
[0:25:18] EUreformed: the problem is que is too much
[0:25:20] itsrikodeine: my friend quit wow cause of dh now i have nobody to do 2s with :(
[0:25:21] Robin_26: retail have alot of potential but blizzard refuse to fix mmr etc

[0:25:28] Esotraz: Tell him in dms then

[6:49:14] mayfire15: have you tried rogue dh?
[6:49:17] unluckythen: @youngfella how tf would this make it better 😭
[6:49:20] ssjin__: the only way to fix shuffle is to remove it permanently
[6:49:25] algebraist97: @youngfella bad idea, comp pick is bigger advantage than map pick
[6:49:35] mayfire15: wtf
[6:49:36] rubenx_9: @ssjin__ SeemsGood
[6:49:36] windythemllf: @youngfella No thanks KEKW

[6:50:32] unluckythen: i zolo Kappa
[6:50:34] unluckythen: swapxy style
[6:50:45] youngfella: @unluckythen encourages more healers to q, also allows players pick/balance comps instead of randomization. just ban duplicate healing classes in same lobby to fix advantage to pick dps first
[6:51:17] rvdsupremas: like if blizz gonna change anything. dh meta is for weeks now. still no changes
[6:51:25] unluckythen: @youngfella it just got even worse with this explanation
[6:51:26] unluckythen: fk me man
[6:51:52] unluckythen: @windythemllf u think its insane=?
[6:51:53] algebraist97: @youngfella the more restrictions you put the longer the queues will be too
[6:52:21] youngfella: @algebraist97 the only restriction is no duplicate healer. but healers get to be captains so more healers will q
[6:52:21] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[6:52:45] unluckythen: duplicate healer legit is the only thing that makes it slightly fair
[6:52:54] windythemllf: @unluckythen I am a tank I would be a last pick in every lobby PepeLaugh
[6:52:56] unluckythen: if its never duplicate u will just have lobbies where u get healer countered
[6:53:03] loveshock7: playing healer in shuffle its pure madness
[6:53:15] rvdsupremas: queus are increasing again
[6:53:16] Blackly: as a healer legit id never q with that captain thing cause it would be whoever picks the most broken class wins by default
[6:53:17] loveshock7: i think i got older 10 years in 3 days

[6:53:49] Degaussr: anyone know what the numbers to the right of gladius are?
[6:53:53] loveshock7: and the fact that u get 0 rating at 3-3 its even worse
[6:54:25] rubenx_9: @Degaussr hots
[6:54:36] zeniththehero: what rlly anoyys me in this trash game as healer is micro cc, absolutely nothing drs

[9:43:42] notmiamiii: haha
[9:43:55] Nezzy243: @Anabolixtv i guess just not like other classes in shuffle where you can do damage efficiently to win, as shadow you need to play as the target in shuffle and in 3's youre majority of the time playing a comp where you arent always the best target
[9:43:58] iamreallyafan: hi dad, still stuck at 2k?

[10:16:05] Warzead: can you mute stream?:d
[10:16:06] OGBeads: @Richardros98 agreed but what you can do is send first bop early so you might be able to get 3 bops in a game (if you use cdr on yourself ), you can lay+sac combo on smaller burst a bit after the first bop
[10:16:38] Richardros98: @OGBeads yes sounds good thanks!
