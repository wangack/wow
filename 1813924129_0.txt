[0:40:21] teh_draz: @AeroheadTV with a few execptions. You cant really level enchanting without blacksmithing bc you need the rods. Herb/alch  mine/engi seem to be the most viable

[6:49:51] marvelousfish: !addons
[6:49:51] Fossabot: @marvelousfish Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[6:49:52] ned___slark: make hybrid classes actually viable
[6:50:03] bbaassttiiii: Dual wield for shaman would be nice
[6:50:03] CheliosCS: rogues tho T_T
[6:50:04] TheHooliganOG: @shroud will you play D4 this weekend and what class will you go for?
[6:50:04] Onyosix: lol better class balance? your saying after all these 20+ years they havent balanced the classes?
[6:50:04] hate_xyz: GIGACHAD warriors
[6:50:06] AToxicRhino: Whats the worst class?
[6:50:08] thenewguy176: it's all browns and yellows in raids
[6:50:10] NILLme: and no world buffs :D
[6:50:10] legndz_tv: but its so fun to play warrior
[6:50:13] Dovashh: Were you an Unbreakable fan on OG Youtube?
[6:50:14] limestwitch: @bbaassttiiii KEKW ?
[6:50:15] StarlightNebula_: Leveling a warrior is absolute pain so that kinda balances it out KEKW
[6:50:16] twinkieted: Because of worldbuffs
[6:50:16] brodycanuck: @bbaassttiiii 2hander cooler and more GIGACHAD
[6:50:18] MoethicalX: Is it worth to start playing WoW ? xD
[6:50:26] MoethicalX: Never played it before
[6:50:31] Onyosix: not worth
[6:50:31] MaoruYokai: whats your take on dungeons on HC classic, do you like how it its atm or you think they should make that you can do anydungeon at anytime without boost tho
[6:50:32] HalfTrack_: That‚Äôs only with world buffs tho. Warriors are mid without em
[6:50:34] SmokeTheButcher: @Mohieyz No
[6:50:49] Krookd1: they fixed munching too in wotlk on the ptr for warrior's and mage
[6:50:50] thenewguy176: If they buff other classes, they have to tune raid bosses
[6:50:51] TheHooliganOG: @shroud will you play D4 this weekend and what class will you go for?
[6:50:57] trashcanff: awww yes bring them all up and make the game easier then it already is. ez way to ruin the game
[6:50:59] dr_device: I feel like classic has gotten chill enough that you can play whatever now
[6:51:08] tomcio_76: Warriors are nasty in classic
[6:51:12] toaster__0: @Mohieyz its a very big grind and can get boring but yes it is really good
[6:51:15] StarlightNebula_: @Mohieyz Don't listen to the haters lol You can give it a try, classic is really different from modern mmos, might be to your liking. The sub for classic also gives you a sub for retail, so you can try both.
[6:51:19] legndz_tv: @HalfTrack_ they still top without wbuffs
[6:51:20] brodycanuck: The reason SoM failed was because of the timing of its release
[6:51:21] MrNello: som was also just stale
[6:51:23] MaoruYokai: @shroud whats your take on dungeons on HC classic, do you like how it its atm or you think they should make that you can do anydungeon at anytime without boost tho
[6:51:24] Saturos47: I think som just failed cuz it was too soon after classic and people were still invested in tbc
[6:51:31] Meatloaph: Its fine for HC
[6:51:32] lemonchilllll: Would be cool with  bgs on release and more easily obtainable gear for each bracket
[6:51:32] limestwitch: EZ rogue
[6:51:33] HamboSan: yoo
[6:51:35] FknLite: i dont feel like classic is even slightly fun wiothout world buffs
[6:51:36] blaqwolf2: WBs are a crutch for shit players who think they are better than they are
[6:51:42] Meatloaph: Saturos47 facts there
[6:51:47] soinoz: Yo chat did Justin die? Wasn't it 3 of em?
[6:51:48] theGraye: world buffs is why i quit classic wow
[6:51:51] Meleko: NODDERS

[6:52:08] brodycanuck: World buffs make the bosses too easy
[6:52:08] gribbins1: i think you just cant go backwards
[6:52:10] flirtle: world buffs are awful
[6:52:11] SmokeTheButcher: @Mohieyz Not a hater I'm being realistic. Not worth the 15$ to play it. unless you do the free trial try it. Lord of the rings online is better
[6:52:11] FknLite: or melee or anything. Just feels dull and unappealing
[6:52:12] Coasterslol21: i think its dependin on the raider, just the fact we had to get WC,Rally,Trib,Songflower,Darkmoon, ZG buff. a  fkin pain in the ass.
[6:52:14] Tobssessxic: Nah fk world buff

[6:52:46] MaoruYokai: whats your take on dungeons on HC classic, do you like how it its atm or you think they should make that you can do anydungeon at anytime without boost tho
[6:52:47] vanella15: ty

[6:52:53] friedbeans5: @Mohieyz Also ffxiv has 2expac that you can play for free is also really fun game

[9:31:54] thewordtv: They just dont allow open world pvp
[9:31:55] Dovashh: Theyre gonna have to change leashing and pvp flagging @shroud
[9:31:55] MARKetzeRoo: This is why they want hardcore dedicated servers.
[9:31:56] FarmerManBill: zero chance they have appeals, remove pvp and kiting
[9:31:59] Kuzye_: no way taht would reguire so much work from them :D
[9:32:01] MaoruYokai: ya they should put GMs back and charge 50usd per month
[9:32:03] eliah907: griefing is way harder on HC server you'll die doing it
[9:32:04] NaDaCure: Remove faction NPC hostilities or remove agro drops.
[9:32:04] Kellorian: just remove pvp flagging
[9:32:05] knocked_20: they would need to risk their character too in official HC
[9:32:09] kaiba1738: maybe you cant fucking flag people without consent lol

[9:32:31] killerbean82: They, Blizzard should improve WOW more and f Diablo xD
[9:32:33] Skritts2112: @shroud mods also don't like to appeal if people don't try their absolute hardest to stay alive

[9:33:12] MARKetzeRoo: @shroud yep.  My exact thoughts too
[9:33:15] Jimmboslice: maybe they should just fix the flightpath bug
[9:33:16] undomieTV: but no appeals

[9:36:31] simplyhow: @texazbandit restedxp you need to pay after lvl 20 tho
[9:36:37] Nickonil: so can you play through wow classic without having to do "group content"? i dont understand wow hardcore xD
[9:36:47] Onyosix: Your definition of griefing vs mine is different. these days griefing is pointed out even for mobbs that get chained pulled. if thats griefing they would have fixed it waaaay back in vanila... but they havent.
[9:36:56] Ronangic: hardcore is a relative term... he is playing according to the established ruleset... where appeals are allowed
[9:37:06] texazbandit: @texazbandit so like a subscription? lol

[9:39:47] nemzky: I mean this isnt a HC server, Blizz shouldnt be perma banning people for killing flagged players
[9:39:52] Anabolic_J: anyone have a clip of the rez?

[9:40:09] KontrolStyle: hahahah
[9:40:10] TheMLGYeet: @way_back in classic mage has no pet
[9:40:21] nemzky: @nemzky pvp isnt griefing
[9:40:23] ameeelio: @nemzky the point is, they are using a bug to force flag them to greif
[9:40:30] Talhadin: those farmers strong KEKW
[9:40:33] akym_mio: @nemzky there wasn't any pvp, they lured a guard over
[9:40:35] TrippenPippin: @nemzky you obviously have no clue how he died
[9:40:36] way_back: @TheMLGYeet i said mage as another good easy class
[9:40:38] TheBassett: @nemzky Not what happened. Same faction player, pulling a guard from Southshore, vanishing and letting guard attack Shroud. Not PvP.
[9:40:39] MARKetzeRoo: @nemzky there is nothing on these servers but HC players and their griefers
[9:40:49] AsyFrost: @nemzky Nemzky when the player from the same faction attacks a high level mob then dips out with vanish to get shroud aggroed it's not pvp, it's griefing
[9:40:52] nemzky: @MARKetzeRoo this is an RP server with a community my dude
[9:40:56] shnurfygoob: @nemzky why are you making shit up? he didnt die to an enemy faction player
[9:41:01] LyonHeartd: no trio tonight bots?
[9:41:02] Skritts2112: If he got heroic strike he should def not be 100 rage

[9:41:48] shnurfygoob: @nemzky you said they shouldnt ban people for killing enemy players. but thats not what even happened. it was someone on his own faction
[9:41:52] immakky: @nemzky they absolutely should ban people for forcing people to become pvp tagged on a rppve server
[9:41:53] MARKetzeRoo: @nemzky the server I was on had no one in Org but HC players.
[9:41:57] vdp42: did this quest as an aoe mage duoing last night.. still took over an hour
[9:42:13] Ayjayyy: @nemzky there is a reason why certain kills dont award honor. its because its bad pvp, which is what griefing is
[9:42:15] AlphaSimply: Also this "HC" has admins and makes decisions quick and fair, imagine the official HC servers, non responses for griefing, AI bot GMs, the auto denies etc
[9:42:26] Squee311: and you keep getting skullls throughout
[9:42:32] shnurfygoob: @Ayjayyy he died to a guard when someone on his own faction dragged it to him and vanished to grief him
[9:42:35] Afrohorze: the guide is for solo
[9:42:38] shnurfygoob: it wasnt even a dishonorable kill
[9:43:08] Ayjayyy: @shnurfygoob wait what the hell is that guy talking about then
[9:43:15] AsyFrost: @nemzky You kinda touching on a subject that wasn't happening in this scenario so it's kind of poorly perceived. Also not really relevant
[9:43:20] shnurfygoob: @Ayjayyy he has no idea hes talking out of his ass
[9:43:22] HeIlraiser_: A game within a game is part of the game
[9:43:27] Nickonil: is this on "wow wrath of the lich king" or "wow classic" ??
[9:43:33] AutoKorrect: What's the recent infatuation with HC WOW anyways?
[9:43:35] shnurfygoob: @HeIlraiser_ youre just a griefer at this point
[9:43:38] modonyx: Odds are that people aren't intentionally flagging in HC so 99% of the time it's griefing
[9:43:41] immakky: if you‚Äôre forcing someone to become pvp flagged and then getting them killed by a lvl60 for example is disruptive behaviour on an rp server and should be punished
[9:43:41] undomieTV: 60 hc just has less value on these servers compared to a server that doesn't allow appeals.
[9:43:47] Ayjayyy: @shnurfygoob yeah seems like it

[9:44:08] Doenerscharff: isnt even better to get killed on a pvp server when other player is 40 lvl above so idk

[9:44:29] akaFarva: thats the defintion of griefing lol
[9:44:35] Onyosix: yesterdays griefing vs todays version of griefing : we were less pampered, but less prepared. Today, more pampered, but better prepared. streams, youtube vids. etc etc..
[9:44:38] peteschaff: i bet there is a correlation between irl stalkers and griefers
[9:44:41] Krekkz: it impact your gameplay experience so thats considered as griefing
[9:44:42] hi_jester: they don't need a rule to ban
[9:44:47] HeIlraiser_: YEP
[9:44:49] add182: anyone wasting there own time to grief someone elses should be banned

Pulling a 60 mob when not pvp flagged and getting forced into pvp flag because someone uses a game mechanic to untarget arrgo isn't intended because u weren't flagging up to fight it
