[1:13:18] Frostyworgz: barrier of faith is close enough no?

[1:19:08] realwendell: time to dig deep
[1:19:20] flalia4: Why don't your DPS just sit the evoker? Evoker should die easier then u
[1:19:23] Frostyworgz: LUL
[1:19:24] Metaphors: hey...
[1:19:30] freelofear: @flalia4 no lol
[1:19:36] gelatokush: if you dps goes dps while they train u an evbeoker get to free cast its over

[1:23:55] CabinetMistake: tfw the pres goes 4-2 and gets nothing
[1:24:08] BigDunkss: @venruki How would you feel if pvp became a separate client from pve? Instead of having to level, you just log in and chose what class you want to play. You choose from a variety of gear sets you can wear and then you just play. No leveling. No gear upgrading. Just log in and play
[1:24:09] percentagesx: sorry ven i tried to peel as much as possible :"(
[1:24:13] Devcomz: Sorry for stupid question but whats an emblem?
[1:24:20] Metaphors: nah
[1:24:26] Wrathbb1: toxic lol
[1:24:26] Metaphors: system is dogshit
[1:24:27] percentagesx: weird azz ww lobby too
[1:24:37] tikdoks: you played your ass off. should feel good about that one
[1:24:46] nameyourform: GREAT TAKE BLUEDRU
[1:24:54] Metaphors: how is it allowed to be this shit for this long
[1:24:57] Metaphors: it angers me so much
[1:25:01] thatiswhyufail: Ven, Hardstuck at a rating. What do you recommend? Record? and rewatch for playstyle trend?   Great Content btw
[1:25:15] Metaphors: drop ego copy leagues system
[1:25:16] Laziltv: u got trained sooo hard
[1:25:19] jonathan_mop: Is this another paladin?
[1:25:27] tikdoks: when they insta shatter your bubble it’s tough to say you played bad
[1:25:29] Wrathbb1: yeah healers are playing a COMPLETELY different game than DPS
[1:25:30] Wrathbb1: its insane
[1:25:37] realwendell: healers lose mmr for going 3-3
[1:25:40] Wrathbb1: its literally just a 1v1 duel for 6 rounds lol
[1:25:42] jonathan_mop: Ooh no. Retribuki
[1:25:52] thatiswhyufail: Ele on one toon and Assa Rogue on other
[1:25:53] jonathan_mop: Sweet!
[1:26:05] Laziltv: What healer for a new pvp player would you recommend
[1:26:12] tikdoks: I would q again
[1:26:14] W00dyyx: Grab an emblem first
[1:26:18] freelofear: @tikdoks can pre line it, or hoj/blind it
[1:26:23] jonathan_mop: I used to watch you on feral druid ya? Was that your awc spec?
[1:26:24] tikdoks: the lobby can’t be that bad again
[1:26:37] Baconeggcheese: Aite what you do now is you freshen up the mog and you go agen
[1:26:39] freelofear: double dh again inc
[1:26:40] Wrathbb1: @tikdoks Blizzard: IT COULD BE WORSE
[1:26:44] BigDunkss: @venruki How would you feel if pvp became a separate client from pve? Instead of having to level, you just log in and chose what class you want to play. You choose from a variety of gear sets you can wear and then you just play. No leveling. No gear upgrading. Just log in and play
[1:26:46] tikdoks: did the Evoker lose rating ?
[1:26:47] datengu: @venruki u picked up the shield but ure not using it enough i think
[1:26:55] Laziltv: What healer for a new pvp player would you recommend
[1:27:05] gelatokush: pally decent into ww an war but not so mucch into dh
[1:27:08] casper24411442: I think blinding that wouldn't have been a bad move
[1:27:17] Metaphors: create systems where u can draft a composition by having an interface that allows you to play up to 3 characters in a pre selected system and at least 1 has to be a healer spec and introduce and autofill system that forces you to heal with 3 games of autofill protection afterwards
[1:27:20] casper24411442: But could be wrong wasn't watching all of it
[1:27:21] casper24411442: My bad.
[1:27:28] cajovysacok: as holy paldin i tend to save bop till higher depening  only sack and healing cds
[1:27:48] Lordshaftington: that sounds absolutely terrible
[1:27:48] Wrathbb1: @Metaphors you and the ten other pvpers be sure to have fun with that
[1:28:02] datengu: @venruki yes, i noticed its not on cd very often. Try checking details for how often u use it
[1:28:04] Laziltv: What healer for a new pvp player would you recommend
[1:28:06] Metaphors: np
[1:28:07] Metaphors: no
[1:28:08] GogumaCat: i like solo shuffle
[1:28:10] zen_oni_shinobi: idk
[1:28:11] gaulois62: i dont really enjoy the format no
[1:28:11] Baconeggcheese: @Metaphors You're saying to force people who don't want to heal to heal?
[1:28:11] casper24411442: No
[1:28:11] Kujo_XX: Nope, cancelled my sub
[1:28:12] Lazarinth: yes
[1:28:12] Metaphors: I hate it
[1:28:14] grayrose_LKP: As a healer? It's miserable.
[1:28:14] bubkex: i love it but hate the que times as dps
[1:28:14] JustTaki: yes. minus queue times
[1:28:15] freelofear: I enjoy healing shuffle, just mmr and dh annoy me
[1:28:15] TonyBoloneyx: no, i wish it was a simple que up for 3's
[1:28:16] L1ckwid: I like it apart from the long queue times and all the DH\s
[1:28:16] reaperz14: Hate it
[1:28:16] buffnac: if mmr wasn’t shit it’d be fun
[1:28:18] Bwrecker: ya just wish healer mmr thing would be fixed. and que time
[1:28:19] Devcomz: I love solo shuffle
[1:28:20] Am0n3r: I like it
[1:28:24] Devcomz: I also like arenas too
[1:28:27] Dinguslordx: I like it, but I'm sure it could be improved upon.
[1:28:29] Badabingpow: its bad for dps with the Q but theres no fix yet
[1:28:34] casper24411442: I am tired as an spriest getting trained everygame
[1:28:36] Metaphors: @Baconeggcheese isnt that already happening?
[1:28:37] Landrysdad: honestly I’d rather it just be a 1 round deal
[1:28:38] Baconeggcheese: I like it but I don't think the trade off is worth it vs having solo que in the ladder
[1:28:38] Swertson: I like solo shuffle, I am kinda over the weird balance and talent choice bloat
[1:28:39] casper24411442: With what feels like no way out
[1:28:39] dermatoid: would it ever be possible 4 dh and 2 healers?
[1:28:39] dizzsmoka: Lol yeah idk new to retail and I have tons of fun with SS
[1:28:39] Badabingpow: and i dont think there ever wil be
[1:28:40] Machine1312: i love it. its the most PvP i've ever done. just the rating that bad
[1:28:40] Lamatastisch: there is stuff to improve on buf overall its a nice system.
[1:28:41] Wrathbb1: I wish it was shuffler-ier
[1:28:41] Am0n3r: 2s SS with 2 dps
[1:28:42] Metaphors: @Baconeggcheese are u watching the same stream I am?
[1:28:43] gaulois62: I would prefer shorter queue with only 1 games round and to the next with different people
[1:28:46] bubkex: everyone here complaining about DH's but i'd rather have a OP DH than for example a broken Destro Lock or WW monk
[1:28:50] dizzsmoka: I heal too lol
[1:28:56] Kujo_XX: Can't justify my free time and even the measly sub for what they're providing.
[1:28:59] mong00sebite: i like it, all my partners quit long ago and i cba LFG
[1:29:00] yeahdoggyyy: 1 dh per game and no tanks would be a start
[1:29:06] Metaphors: I play 3s for prestige tho
[1:29:11] gelatokush: its not 3s thats awful imo but lfg is worst then ss
[1:29:14] Baconeggcheese: I enjoy the random comps and the lack of ykno.. not being able to get into groups
[1:29:17] Dinguslordx: I like that solo suffer gives you some variance you wouldn't get from 3s.
[1:29:18] tikdoks: not in current form. needs changes to MMR / CR calc and needs a different lobby structure like best of 3
[1:29:23] Landrysdad: 3s has not more prestige
[1:29:24] Sinizster24: if blizzard hired some people that only focused on pvp and making changes instead of putting pvp on back burner and making everyone work on the new expansion
[1:29:25] mong00sebite: would like there to be a limit to 1 class per lobby tho, fuck this double dh shit
[1:29:45] Devcomz: Honestly just injecting mmr in 2s 3s and shuffle will get peoples attention to come back with more participation
[1:29:45] Metaphors: theres no prestige or integrity in solo shuffle....bcuz players can afk...and the system is bad
[1:29:55] tikdoks: but love the concept of SS. it’s my favorite PvP mode in terms of fun when playing
[1:30:00] gelatokush: if your not rank 1 / multi gald and your just a rando 1800 player 3s is awful
[1:30:01] datengu: @venruki btw, barrier of faith conversion is 50% in pvp (instead of 25%)
[1:30:12] buffnac: they can afk in any competitive game lol
[1:30:16] Metaphors: if u abuse afk u can climb super easily
[1:30:18] Devcomz: @gelatokush this is true
[1:30:26] Neriakied: there hasnt been prestige in 3s for a long time so thats not rly an argument tbh
[1:30:27] Wrathbb1: wut
[1:30:31] Metaphors: avoid all lobbies u do bad in
[1:30:35] Metaphors: perma spike ur mmr
[1:30:40] miridafeo: Ya what do you mean
[1:30:44] Devcomz: Dont afk someone in my RBG group got a 3 week suspension for doing that
[1:30:50] Landrysdad: BoF is super good
[1:30:56] Metaphors: I see it so often
[1:31:00] Frostyworgz: tons of people do that
[1:31:01] Metaphors: everytime I win 5 rounds
[1:31:02] Lordshaftington: you see the comp when you queue in and you leave if it's unfavorable
[1:31:03] Metaphors: healer afks
[1:31:04] realwendell: lot of leavers
[1:31:04] yeahdoggyyy: half my games people afk out off
[1:31:06] dermatoid: Well that sounds reportable to just afk all the time
[1:31:07] Lordshaftington: lose cr but no mmr
[1:31:16] stealthwalker99: no one does that at high mmr
[1:31:24] casper24411442: Just log spriest
[1:31:27] Metaphors: @stealthwalker99 wrong.
[1:31:42] casper24411442: You think pally gets trained lol
[1:31:48] gelatokush: @Metaphors thats kinda true everytime u win 5 rounds on hesler u have to litterally pray other doesnt leave sometimes i even feel liek throwing round 6
[1:32:05] Landrysdad: Hpal is by far the easiest healer to kill and lore wise they should be the hardest
[1:32:05] tikdoks: not sure they should have applied the armor nerf to pally
[1:32:09] bexleybathie123: Ven i love it when you commentate appretiate you man
[1:32:11] casper24411442: Sp is so tough man
[1:32:18] tikdoks: they were not tanks enough as it is
[1:32:19] Moobot: Latest video "Peak WoW" view it here: youtu.be/cJOtsHIfv3w
[1:32:25] ilikegoldfishes: did they gut disc priest?
[1:32:26] casper24411442: Makes me upset
[1:32:38] jonathan_mop: What's with the same maps for years. Need more variety.
[1:32:49] casper24411442: I have 2 locks
[1:32:53] casper24411442: Just bored of playing it
[1:32:57] jonathan_mop: Not that they aren't great.
[1:32:59] tyse_is_raw: Hows aff lock in ur opinion?
[1:33:04] casper24411442: I haven't
[1:33:10] tikdoks: I second that. I wouldn’t watch the AWC cast if you weren’t on it
[1:33:10] Badabingpow: i love mage in arena
[1:33:10] Neriakied: tbh my biggest complaint other than balancing is the random decision to have a map rotation for arena
[1:33:12] casper24411442: Tried arcane and I just didn't understand it
[1:33:24] cajovysacok: again 2dh LMAO
[1:33:28] jasonkbkt: Prob with sp is it has no mobility and has to hard casr
[1:33:29] gelatokush: i dont think sp is that hard i dont even think its harder then destro, on lock u need a kitting path sp u stand still and rotate magic schools when u get kick
[1:33:37] casper24411442: I see other arcane mages blasting then I play it and I am hitting like a wet noodle
[1:33:46] cajovysacok: also melle loby
[1:33:48] dailyshuffle: ..........
[1:33:55] yeahdoggyyy: its a plague
[1:33:56] gdodmebxu: they need to revert sub nerfs so dh can feel what every other class does vs them again Kappa
[1:33:59] tikdoks: just like the ret patch
[1:34:03] teemzen: My last lobby to 2400 ss was 3x dh, satisfying :)
[1:34:06] casper24411442: I've been 2k as frost
[1:34:11] casper24411442: Not this season though
[1:34:43] gdodmebxu: @casper24411442 don't surge/mark without missiles/4set proc
[1:35:00] dailyshuffle: this is so dumb
[1:35:02] Taevenx: is DH good?
[1:35:03] jasonkbkt: Freedom and pillar
[1:35:08] bigvin01: what addon was that that showed last games
[1:35:12] casper24411442: Thank you @gdodmebxu
[1:35:33] Taevenx: DH just gonna train
[1:35:38] hoodgamerx: dk grip as a healer is the scariest fucking thing ever
[1:35:41] percentagesx: are you using emblem?
[1:35:41] goatedsp: gee retail looks so skillful and fun i wonder why everyones on sod
[1:35:46] gdodmebxu: @casper24411442 also get 4 charge and barrage into mark

[1:35:59] Taevenx: highest IQ DH just training healers 6 rounds Kappa

[1:36:27] hoodgamerx: truth @jasonkbkt
[1:36:29] reaperz14: I leave probably 70% of my queues on all my healers
[1:36:40] Wrathbb1: lol I just read the first SS suggestion I kinda like: "Setting a time for matches if it reaches that time both healers win could be interesting." probably would lead to some weird stuff but I like the thrust of it.
[1:36:45] casper24411442: @gdodmebxu How you farm the procs off the start spell steal ?
[1:36:56] tikdoks: tell them to run at the priest
[1:37:08] gdodmebxu: @casper24411442 yeah or blast/explosion anything that spends mana

[1:51:20] Vigi9413: win 4/6 and don’t get rewarded baffles me
[1:51:28] Wrathbb1: I think everytime the matchmaking makes a 2+ DH lobby it should just delete the DH's from the owners accounts
[1:51:33] realwendell: doesnt that make your next lobby really hard to get any reward from now

[1:57:16] Wrathbb1: that guy lives the craziest life
[1:57:25] TactiTortoise: Oh! Bigdam! As an enhance main, that man is my hero. I am hardstuck 1900-1950 this season lol
[1:57:26] dailyshuffle: is this bigdam?
[1:58:17] Lamatastisch: nope
[2:00:07] TactiTortoise: @Lamatastisch That is actually. One of his only alts not named big dam. The other is another owens.
[2:00:16] bigdam2024: its not bigdam its crusaders sister
[2:00:24] drfeltgood: YO, @venruki . I have atrosious MMR on my FW from the beginning of season tanking on MW. I'm at 1198. the issue I'm running into being this low is I always have 1 dps that is doing placement games or has no idea what defensive to use so I go 3-3 with zro cr or mmr gain. Am I better just going with my Monk that is 70 has green gear but fresh mmr?
[2:00:28] dilsnick: 1600 priest with some good ass plays
[2:00:28] fatlittlepaypig: dampening stacks way too fast in shuffle man wtf
[2:00:34] ButtaTWD: are you avenging crusaders ban?
[2:00:35] Vigi9413: retribuki carrying
[2:00:41] lawsonst: How close to 2.4 now?
[2:00:45] Hobblefoot: I have to share something no one will believe.   I decided to try Resto Druid and my record in solo was 1 win ... 24 loses up to my last solo.  Hahaha.  Oof.
[2:00:48] drfeltgood: ok
[2:00:57] drfeltgood: i'll keep pressing see what happens
[2:01:04] Badabingpow: @fatlittlepaypig i mean wouldnt high level lobbies last like an hr almost if the damp was the same as 3s?
[2:01:24] zachgamegodx: @Hobblefoot not bad at all
[2:01:26] fatlittlepaypig: @Badabingpow no because you can drink in 3s
[2:01:35] Badabingpow: @fatlittlepaypig fair point
[2:01:36] zachgamegodx: 4% win rate
[2:02:02] Hobblefoot: @zachgamegodx I mean .... The people in my lobbies were not so happy. LOL
[2:02:30] tikdoks: @drfeltgood if you play a lot of games, I would just tough out the elo hell. if not, definitely start another character

[2:04:02] gaychris: howdy partner
[2:04:14] fatlittlepaypig: r druid is like the hardest healer to learn
[2:04:18] fatlittlepaypig: in terms of playstyle
[2:04:31] fatlittlepaypig: hots dont heal like they used to it's more about stacking multipliers
[2:05:11] Badabingpow: i remember when genesis was meta, that was my fav druid meta, but it doesnt exist anymore
[2:05:14] fatlittlepaypig: id unironically suggest learning how to pve heal on an r druid before pvping on one because you need a good healing rotation
[2:05:45] tikdoks: you know @drfeltgood start a new character. I forgot about how weak MW is this season. it will take you until the next season to get back to 1500 unless you just play an insane number of games

[2:31:44] dilsnick: Have you read the book Ven? Shogun and Tai Pan are amazing books
[2:31:44] cybergenik: the live action is garbage
[2:31:45] zachgamegodx: I’m so bad at watching tv shows, I can only watch movies
[2:31:46] Nemenon: I though tthe first season of halo was really bad?
[2:31:52] Chillatech: first season was garbo...they turned a stone cold master chief into a fuckn emo loser
[2:31:54] Zevyn1312: Looks cool but I'm extremly fatigued of this edo period japanese aesthetic too. Blue Eye Samurai was great but the brutality of an inherently fascistic feudal society gets tiring
[2:31:54] DontDv8: considering i didnt care much for the games, i actually enjoyed it knowing very little of the lore
[2:31:54] Vigi9413: I’ve heard the live action airbender was no bueno
[2:32:03] ramenxo: finally got around to making a house in enshrouded https://ibb.co/wYVBg7x
[2:32:07] Baconeggcheese: Its... entertaining enough but its worse than the original
[2:32:10] Chillatech: live action air bender is good
[2:32:22] dilsnick: Book is old AF, came out in 1975
[2:32:23] LiLb444: Its not
[2:32:23] Chillatech: but yeah season 1 of halo is ass
[2:32:28] cybergenik: it was horrible, trust
[2:32:28] Badabingpow: its not but theyre making a better obe
[2:32:29] LokixSun: it's good
[2:32:30] LiLb444: I gave it a 3.7/10
[2:32:34] Lookmeupz: live action air bender was decent not great but decent

[2:32:43] Badabingpow: a new airbender is on the way which looks muhc better
[2:32:51] zachgamegodx: I feel like air bender should be kept a cartoon
[2:32:58] Kymagez: So dis they
[2:33:00] Vigi9413: they can’t seem to get a live action airbender right the show was just too good
[2:33:25] TheDarthWayman: same

[2:33:34] Kymagez: I watched it in 1 nigh

[2:33:41] Kymagez: Decent
[2:33:50] TheDarthWayman: the comics books are great too
[2:33:50] Chillatech: even if you dont watch the live action, watch the cartoon
[2:33:55] Kymagez: Corny but good
[2:34:01] TheDarthWayman: Kyoshi novels are badass
[2:34:17] LiLb444: One of the best parts of it was the character depth and development and they might as well have thrown that away in the live action. The two guys who created the cartoon version stepped away cause of the direction
[2:34:20] Badabingpow: it is a GOOD MOVIE
[2:34:21] Badabingpow: CAPS
[2:34:22] Chillatech: that japanese actor was in the last samurai too wasnt he

[3:02:51] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[3:02:54] gelatokush: yea cuz boomy mastery scalling is so bad
[3:02:58] ferahgok: @fatlittlepaypig You can def pump with mastery but you really need the haste and vers to land clones and live so you can't really play with much unforch

[3:09:53] foxyllama: i wanna play boomy now
[3:09:57] gelatokush: immo dispel has been a pvp talent since sl but the problem is the new talent that gave immo 2 charges and 25% chance to reset a charge when u use it
[3:10:00] Baconeggcheese: He was about to die too
[3:10:09] Baconeggcheese: he cocooned himself at 10%
[3:10:12] foxyllama: i would go 40% haste lul after seeing that

[3:10:56] slapatac: MW was grieving
[3:11:05] nimbus420i: there should be a balance between range and melee in shuffle
[3:11:17] nimbus420i: being solo range in tripple/quad melee lobby sucks
[3:11:19] FrankFrank: ruki after dark. Is this like normal venruki but he says frick more?
[3:11:37] gelatokush: ive been having a easier time on sp in ss lately then on my boomy
[3:11:55] Telarius1: kinda funny but that ret was prob also spam dispelling ur dots every judgment
[3:11:59] Telarius1: along with the dh spam dispel
[3:12:00] Blastmindx: yeah spriest isnt bad in m+ still gets owned by dh tho
[3:12:16] gelatokush: sp is just tankier then boomy
[3:12:18] Blastmindx: m+ lol, i meant ss
[3:12:36] gelatokush: they self heal lot more too
[3:12:52] Poolzstream: how the roles are reversed ven youre on a warrior now hitting a druid in bear form Kappa
[3:12:59] Blastmindx: yee they are tanky
[3:13:12] hawgcast: DH should get cyclone, they need a better CC
[3:13:22] schwammgurke: is there a anti dh class for ss?
[3:13:30] gelatokush: nop
[3:13:53] gelatokush: arcane mage maybe they leave u alone
[3:14:00] Blastmindx: i think outlaw is pretty good vs dh cuz they die in stuns
[3:14:01] gelatokush: if your good
[3:14:05] Voriq: @schwammgurke destro lock
[3:14:28] schwammgurke: @voriq how is that?
[3:16:00] Voriq: @schwammgurke map dependant kinda but if you're good at kiting its possible lol did it all the time
[3:16:11] Voriq: + rift
[3:17:25] gelatokush: i dont think destro is an anti dh class but its the best caster
[3:17:38] Telarius1: @Blastmindx not even. outlaw can just infinitely cc the dh tho and take him out of game that way is best option
[3:17:46] Telarius1: cheap shot every eyebeam/kidney shut em down
[3:18:16] TheHunterStatistic: @venruki are u not running ms pvp talent?
[3:18:23] deafnflaccid: dont forget me this time
