[2:27:16] Convoak: Eyes of the beast?
[2:27:36] Tinit5190: btw
[2:27:39] DrunkenHorror: no idea,  i was standing right next to the hunter and his pet killed me

[2:30:27] DrunkenHorror: @DrunkenHorror no, i i attacked the pet back and the guards slaped me
[2:30:59] DrunkenHorror: @DrunkenHorror im ASSUMING it was because the hunter was aliance and it was during the blood moon so the guards didnt know what to do but its fucking stupid TBH
[2:31:05] Spyke_ZGZ: @DrunkenHorror So you admittedly committed animal abuse and are upset you got reprimanded?

[2:35:11] StreamElements: Shaw Cable is still garbage and has further tainted Rogers as a provider. He has no other options for providers in his area, and StarLink is not an option because he lives under a flight path.
[2:35:50] kidscientis: it broke in like the first 20 minutes
[2:35:58] SteamboatMickeyLegit: It's still broken, can't even open it

[2:38:00] kidscientis: 😁
[2:38:11] kidscientis: on barb
[2:38:19] SteamboatMickeyLegit: I sold a bis pair of riveted for 500g to test, loose gold filled inventory and it deleted the rest LUL
[2:38:41] SteamboatMickeyLegit: Now imagine selling a named and only keeping like 250 gold LUL
[2:39:16] Spyke_ZGZ: Seeing all the Barbarian players mald is probably the best content I've gotten out of DnD tbh
[2:39:40] kidscientis: honestly this update has like no effect on barbs except rage
[2:39:49] kidscientis: past like purp gear tho
[2:40:20] Spyke_ZGZ: Nah, apparently people are whining that default kit popping Reckless puts them at -345% PDR
[2:40:24] kidscientis: they did but the issue with ironmaces stuff is that they only nerf things to the base class and never to the high end
[2:40:32] kidscientis: reckless was useless anyways
[2:40:43] kidscientis: u do so much dmg it doesn't even matter
[2:40:47] SteamboatMickeyLegit: -5 str and -2s on roar is really the gist of it
[2:40:59] kidscientis: savage roar is still bis
[2:41:05] kidscientis: and now they can use a shield so
[2:41:06] kidscientis: ...
[2:41:09] Spyke_ZGZ: While you're probably right, it's the reddit community.
[2:41:16] kidscientis: ig now barbs are ranger proof too
[2:41:17] Spyke_ZGZ: They're gonna whine about whatever they can KEKW
[2:41:19] SteamboatMickeyLegit: Yea lmfao, they got a shield LUL
[2:41:45] SteamboatMickeyLegit: Yep
[2:41:53] SteamboatMickeyLegit: Basically a full on buff
[2:42:07] kidscientis: do u guys think all weapons and stuff should be usable based on how much dex, str, etc you have or nah
[2:42:12] kidscientis: that could be interesting
[2:42:41] kidscientis: actually nah they'll probably do that when multiclassing releases
[2:43:10] SteamboatMickeyLegit: Rage did get an actual nerf though to be fair
[2:44:05] kidscientis: before, you needed 304 base speed to hit speed cap with rage
[2:44:25] kidscientis: now it's 318

[11:47:11] CrouchingGoat: True. Idk dick about wtfever this version is
[11:48:28] CrouchingGoat: Ah, k. That's interesting at least
[11:49:26] LumberChopMan: still holding 5, just say the word
[11:49:42] LumberChopMan: wtf
[11:49:46] LumberChopMan: literally when you ask
[11:49:47] CrouchingGoat: Off topic but have you seen gameplay for that nww dark and darker clone?
[11:49:50] LumberChopMan: it changed me to 1
[11:49:55] LumberChopMan: I have been checking this whole time
[11:50:03] LumberChopMan: sorry man lol
[11:50:22] LumberChopMan: lemme check other chars now
[11:50:44] Ghrimm: o damn still goin... doin a 24?
[11:51:35] CrouchingGoat: Just another money grab clone attempt imo. Copy original, make some easy things feel better (weapon collision, sound, etc) but ultimately just a money grab.
[11:51:51] CrouchingGoat: Dick opinion but I'm OK with it xD
[11:52:01] Ghrimm: ive been grinding Dark and darker all night. almost got my 7th char to Wanderer, tryna get them coin bags for the next season :)

[11:53:53] Ghrimm: it gives like minus 420% armor, so u pretty much get 1 shot when u use it.
[11:54:02] Ghrimm: Dungeonborne
[11:54:08] CrouchingGoat: There just seems to be no challenge. Mobs are slow af
[11:54:22] Ghrimm: its not a clone like Greed is Good was
[11:54:23] CrouchingGoat: Think open beta right meow
[11:54:34] LumberChopMan: That amazing, I have been running my dumb hunter around aub every 5 min for lke 2+ hours and as soon as you asked it literally stopped showing layer and then put me on 1 LUL
