[2:35:14] Jayremy: Most areas good for lockpicking were water areas, coasts and lakes, Angor Fortress by Uldaman, later on is like Tanaris, then SM and BRD dungeons
[2:35:19] Triknives: It was on the Anthem reddit but got taken down. Sounds like it was a troll.
[2:35:22] nitemare34godd: Aztec gaming
[2:35:32] nitemare34godd: toward the end I’ll get one
[2:35:34] itsjustcyn: It was a troll twab
[2:35:37] itsjustcyn: its not real
[2:35:44] Thee_Phantom_Spider: I thought EA owned the game LOL
[2:36:04] Molvonos: Clickbait bullshit.
[2:36:12] Jayremy: Stonetalon and redridge at lower lvls
[2:36:16] Molvonos: Downvoting out of principle.
[2:36:17] shortyforthewin: so any new things you americans will have on chrismas table in food

[2:36:26] nitemare34godd: after 12:17
[2:36:32] nitemare34godd: really that was not real

[2:36:39] Thee_Phantom_Spider: Ham and green bean casserole
[2:36:44] shortyforthewin: ok
[2:36:58] Thee_Phantom_Spider: NC didnt even try with wildstar LOL
[2:37:03] nox503: usually its either ham, a roast, or turkey it differs for each family really
[2:37:10] Triknives: Some Lamb and Goat!
[2:37:13] Thee_Phantom_Spider: they gave that game what like 3 months and shut it down
[2:37:17] shortyforthewin: nahh used too add some grilled ribs some years and so on
[2:37:41] TacticalFuzz: There's a fish'n'chip shop in the UK that's started selling Batter covered Mince Pies :D
[2:37:57] Alaquane: lots of developers commented that there were too many managers
[2:38:05] nox503: my favorite mount for wild star were the hoverboards
[2:38:09] Thee_Phantom_Spider: i played for 3 months cause thats when AA and BDO came out and ESO
[2:38:26] Jarwerewolf: lul
[2:38:28] Thee_Phantom_Spider: and then they shut it down and i know it came back up like a few months later
[2:38:48] Alaquane: when Stephan Frost left for Blizzard
[2:38:56] Alaquane: and he was the most animated lead devs

[2:39:47] Jayremy: Developers are solely responsible for a game sucking. Publishers and oversight may impact it, but developers chose to go along with it. Publishers or otherwise are to blame when they kill the project.
[2:39:53] seabass82: I kind of remember wildstyle being a "callback" to vanilla wow
[2:39:59] Thee_Phantom_Spider: anyways i did liek that moba game NCSoft made it was fun and they shut it down it made me sad
[2:40:03] EllisTheMenace1: wildstar was so good id like it again but just reduce the leveling time and all the mad attuments for raids
[2:40:15] Thee_Phantom_Spider: master X master
[2:41:06] Thee_Phantom_Spider: @EllisTheMenace1 dawg they needed to do something for PvP zones both factions should not spawn in the same respawn point LOL
[2:41:18] Alaquane: maintaining 2 separate 20 man rosters to try and form a 40 man raid
[2:41:30] Thee_Phantom_Spider: i got to lv 41 before i quit i didnt mind the grind
[2:41:40] TheUnknowing: attunement honestly i think is probably a big factor to killing it
[2:41:42] Thee_Phantom_Spider: i think in about 5 days
[2:41:45] Alaquane: I also had the latest brand new AMD graphics card and it barely ran at 30 fps
[2:41:55] Thee_Phantom_Spider: way to go cupcake
[2:41:58] shortyforthewin: we in sweden do a thingy every chrismas its called jansson its sliced potatos like french fries size then we have 1 layer of anjovis then potatoes again  onion slized and salt pepper and dubbel cream 5 dl   in the oven at 225  until it some color on it

[2:42:58] War_L0ck: Certificate is just RP bank filler.
[2:43:03] shortyforthewin: ok dident know that archangel
[2:43:04] Jayremy: A lot of MMOs didn't appeal to me because they weren't different enough from WoW, especially in the elements that were aged or unappealing and Blizzard moved away from. The refused to learn. I didn't need a WoW re-skinned, I wanted different gameplay.
[2:43:06] UnearthedSin: The cert is just fluff. don't need it to lock pick.
[2:43:20] Thee_Phantom_Spider: grindy games need to reward your time
[2:43:41] RaptureRiot: agreed
[2:44:13] Thee_Phantom_Spider: Its an ARPG survival mmo game
[2:44:16] Alaquane: mmo looter shooter? Gothalion and Cohh have been playing it a lot recently
[2:44:19] holst23: i would love to try once human
[2:44:22] ArchAngel_83: @shortyforthewin It is a swedish originally we just copied it :D
[2:44:25] holst23: games looks so good
[2:44:36] Thee_Phantom_Spider: @Alaquane its fun i think
[2:44:40] Jayremy: One game I did switch to was Vindictus. But the model Nexon had for the game kind of sucked for later game progression. It was so stale to slow unless you paid.
[2:45:07] Thee_Phantom_Spider: looter shooter i guess is probably a better game
[2:45:09] Alaquane: 3rd person
[2:45:12] holst23: nah its third person
[2:45:16] rakimm: I am waiting for Greg Street new studio mmorpg that will come out in 10 years lol

[2:47:03] holst23: not at all
[2:47:10] itsjustcyn: pvp is optional and not the main part of the game
[2:47:12] Gioozey: surprised you're just now hearing about it XD everyone on twitch is playing it almost
[2:47:18] Gioozey: it's a pvp server or pve
[2:47:22] Gioozey: it's not forced
[2:47:23] Jayremy: What I hate about survival games is when it's 90% a PvP experience and the PvE is totally not challenging and people just want to grief.

[4:00:56] AzedaNA: Soul Link Warlocks were damn near unkillable in Classic, now they have 100% more armor and health drain?
[4:01:05] RoguelolBeast: currently rogue tanks are like druid tanks. they dont get hit often, but when they do get hit. it hurts alot more than warriors/pallies

[4:04:12] snuffles_80: yeah one per slot sound likely
[4:04:19] ChumpsMcGee: might get like 3 for a new slot, then 1 or 2 others
[4:04:20] AzedaNA: Yeah, Soul Link makes you take 10% less damage. They're going to have like 70-80% DR
[4:04:32] RoguelolBeast: more like 4 new runes. 1 per slot OR 1 new slot with 4 options.
[4:04:37] geokouts: at the end will have for each slot a rune?

[4:22:55] zorantt: Question: Why would they split the PTR for 10.2.6? Is it to keep the surprise (no datamining) or is it to test a new system thing? (Doesn't have to be a big system)

[4:49:29] OviTheGray: im not playing SOD and i still think is good
[4:49:41] Bowwjack: @Towelliee 4m characters created in the first month it's a fucking massive success. But Retail is desgined to be a seasonal game where you push hard for like the first month or two of the season on your main then kinda fuck off.
[4:49:43] ThrottleJunkie: I agree they have a winner with SOD... Let's hope they do not mess it up.
[4:49:48] AzedaNA: I mean we are how many days in and leveling zones are still popping off

[4:56:28] geokouts: i think you have to get poisoned to get the rune
[4:56:40] one2gone: bear tank 17
[4:56:53] AzedaNA: I got shit on hard for criticizing how the forced group content to get tank runes etc
[4:57:03] GeordieMarauder: bears are stuck behind the ratchet quests too
[4:57:05] modonaut: in the grand scheme of the whole season its not a big deal but i get what you are saying

[5:40:27] Molvonos: lol
[5:40:28] mrwaddles22: just visit a 7/11 every day there
[5:40:29] Wulfgrym: tattoos are a problem in japan too
[5:40:35] Blankt_: Tipping could be rude in some countries cause you are telling them they under value their own food and staff.
[5:40:37] EpicJune: yeah will look bad on them
[5:40:37] AzedaNA: Japanese take their jobs seriously
[5:40:39] Sollice: @Towelliee Do yourself a favor...look at the type of establishment your going to and then find out

[5:41:30] PvtHudson093: Id kill for vending machines to be everywhere
[5:41:34] Merkavore: hahaha
[5:41:36] AzedaNA: My uncle says he watched a girl in a clothing store fold all these clothes in a neat stack. Then she kept refolding them just to stay busy. Their work ethic is on another level
[5:41:43] Merkavore: get me the real dragon balls
[5:41:44] ashwing_: bro card shops are crazy there from what ive seen
[5:42:02] relaption: you'd think that with how many people in america value convenience that there'd be more vending machines
