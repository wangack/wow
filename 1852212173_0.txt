[1:15:53] JESSIEJR: They should just make All BGs Rated tbh

[2:57:34] bbbbbb25: 16 is better than 8 lol
[2:57:37] JattixTV: its usually because you need to cap the fps for it in the settings or it overloads obs as it is streaming it
[2:57:48] JESSIEJR: @Pallyofhell 4k  @120 cap, still good enough. wonder if he caps his fps then?
[2:58:03] Pallyofhell: consoles are capped at 60 fps
