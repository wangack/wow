[0:32:36] Collnaris: that answers that
[0:32:51] g4nymedes: hello pirate Annie
[0:32:52] Aegis_2566: When you played Black Flag, Skull and Bones feels like AliExpress version of Black Flag
[0:32:55] itsmedemolink: assasins creed black flag is what got me intrested in pirate games. reason i played sea of  thieves tbh
[0:33:02] loppish91: imagine if they just did exacly like it is in blackflag ppl would love it
[0:33:08] Grayfawks509: woah‚Ä¶Annie Brunette is jarring lol. love the cosplay tho!
[0:33:12] wesjer250: its really just a worse ac4 in that sense, not saying the game is bad but it really is
[0:33:16] Collnaris: you can't walk around ship like for repairs or to canons?
[0:33:16] JonnyBravo2323: hi Annie! Nice pirate outfit!:)
[0:33:17] Bloodmatch: Black flag you can walk anniesSole
[0:33:20] Alastor7783: black flag was great, but I wish they didn't shoehorn ship combat into every subsequent AC game Smadge
[0:33:28] mel_purple: @loppish91 would be way more difiuclt to even have pvp then
[0:33:33] Taylor131313: Annie do you know if you'll have a discount code for DHS tickets btw? code Anniefuchsia currently doesn't work Smadge
[0:33:36] BattleHulk87: afternoon @AnnieFuchsia i hope you are good and well
[0:33:44] Aegis_2566: A bit exaggerated with the AliExpress thing, but it is sadly underwhelming compared to AC4
[0:33:59] Turbopumper: in SoT you reload the cannons and repair the ship yourself in first person LUL
[0:34:10] Taylor131313: would be nice to stack discount code on early bird ticket like last year WideHardo
[0:34:13] Aegis_2566: SoT gets you alot more immersed
[0:34:18] loppish91: i actually thought it would be that you can run around on your big ship and do stuff on it
