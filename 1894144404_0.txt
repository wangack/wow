[1:55:25] mavericks312: please god let tyson and paul happen i wanna see him get decapitated
[1:55:29] DrkPhoenix6913: short of paying tyson 100 mil, tyson is going to kill him
[1:55:32] skylaars: jake paul vs canelo is the only one I want to see.
[1:55:37] SeeStrong: There’s a reason Jake Paul keeps challenging older MMA fighters. He can’t win against true career boxers

[1:55:46] phocho: I think Tyson is friends with the Paul brothers
[1:55:52] zeiours: Whens towelliee v Jake Paul happening
[1:55:53] Kinggalanas: It’s not a prime Mike Tyson
[1:55:53] SeeStrong: Canelo would end him and I’d love to see it
[1:55:55] phocho: he will def hold back if it does happen
[1:55:56] falldrgn: Mike Tyson? Thats a lose lose match, win? You beat a 60 year old man, lose.. you lost to a 60 year old man
[1:55:57] DrkPhoenix6913: tyson to this day is still a beast
[1:55:58] tonyr23: Paul Brothers needs to box real boxers and not these old guys
[1:56:00] dyslexican1: I couldn't care less about two billionaires embarrassing themselves in a fight. But lets face it Elon musk is a joke, that out of shape D-bag will gas in round one.
[1:56:09] darkrowse21: hope tyson knock has chiny chiny ass out
[1:56:16] mavericks312: @Kinggalanas old tyson still takes pauls head off
[1:57:27] skylaars: mike has videos of him recently of him hitting pads. he is still scary
[1:57:46] mavericks312: ppl out here acting like tyson isnt tyson

[1:57:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: That guy who taslked smack to Tyson on that plane didn't do so well LUL
[1:58:23] falldrgn: Thats vastly d ifferent.. tho
[1:58:57] LuiBMHunter: Tyr isn't a very cheerful dude is he
[1:58:58] falldrgn: Hitting someone when they are sitting down, vs someone with gloves and is protecting themselves
[1:59:17] mavericks312: as long as tyson isnt paid off paul goes down round 1
[1:59:22] Ealdfox: I remember Donnie Yen talking about his fight with Tyson in Ip Man 3, he said he feared for his life LUL
[2:00:07] avarose8910: there should be a mog of that hammer
[2:00:47] Ealdfox: If he dies, he dies
[2:00:48] doomester: @Towelliee what about Fury fight?
[2:00:53] abracka_: got paid $10 mil for that shit lol
[2:00:53] mavericks312: personally i wanna see jake go up against gervontae but paul to scared for that
[2:01:02] phocho: that Nate fight was what.. 185?  Jake had to cut down.  Nate's fat ass just walked in
[2:01:02] falldrgn: all those guys are getting paid. cause you know his ass is broke.
[2:01:16] skylaars: he made bank with his conor trilogy
[2:01:23] falldrgn: 15-20 million
[2:01:27] skylaars: prob not as much as this fight though
[2:01:54] abracka_: boxing money is on a whole ass diff level
[2:01:54] ackdogg007: I think Tyson might think of it as fun and games tell he gets hit one time then game on
[2:02:04] skylaars: if you don't include his fights with conor its prob more like 5-10 mill
[2:02:42] soflotcg: UFC fighters lost their asses when Dana signed the reebok deal and went that route.
[2:02:45] mavericks312: yea idk the whole paul brother stuff is kind of a mockery to boxing
[2:02:47] yoitsGrowl: Still haven’t run this dungeon yet
[2:02:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would watch a match where Tyson knocks out Logan in 5 seconds
[2:02:56] dyslexican1: Yeah, meanwhile UFC can't "afford" to pay their fighters more. Its kinda disgusting's how much money they pocket and let those fighters beat their brains out for scraps.
[2:02:59] abracka_: tyson fury vs jake paul?
[2:03:02] homewrecker101: furys a joke now
[2:03:07] SoulSlayer088: Canelo and GGG
[2:03:16] abracka_: we would witness paul get murdered live
[2:03:22] falldrgn: Fury wouldn't even give a care. didn't one of them "beat" jake or logan?

[2:05:03] AndorfineLive: and he knows it, hes only in for the money, its like wwe, a show and people buy it
[2:05:47] mavericks312: @AndorfineLive ppl would pay more to see him get his head taken off though
[2:05:55] Mecabeast: At what point do we stop memeing about Jake Paul being a boxer and accept he's a legitimate one
[2:05:56] homewrecker101: tyson is only bothered about money thats why he ducked uysk
[2:06:17] homewrecker101: @Mecabeast when he fights a real boxer
[2:06:22] falldrgn: I think the only Legit fighter Jake paul fought was tommy fury..  and by legit..thats a stretch
[2:06:28] mavericks312: @Mecabeast when he beats a legit boxer wtf

[2:07:45] PotbellyGoat: I think he should stick to WWE
[2:08:02] dyslexican1: To be fair, its as legit as what a lot of real boxers do, fight a bunch of shitcans, and only take one or two "decent" fights to position for a tightly fight.
[2:08:06] PotbellyGoat: I mean, that is where he belongs lol
[2:08:07] mavericks312: i mean his boxing matches are basically wwe esque
[2:08:13] soflotcg: theres a huge difference between fighting real boxers and MMA fighters. in boxing you dont worry about being kicked or taken down. boxing by far pays a ton more for no good reason
[2:08:14] Gillettefuzionz: @PotbellyGoat wrong brother

[2:14:13] doomester: didnt they say that there might be a 10.3 patch?
[2:14:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo coming in second last time, I would expect them to try hard for this one, no doubt
[2:14:17] mavericks312: and if the raid is like abberus its in liquids favor highly
[2:14:19] Tac2cul: when is next raid?
[2:14:29] mavericks312: 10.3 will be the equivelent of fated raids
[2:14:50] Affiiance: I will be happy with a fated season
[2:15:20] Heero_Effect: Nah my auntie’s best friend hair dresser was cutting ion’s hair and said 10.3 will be a 6 boss raid Kappa

[2:15:26] tonyr23: I think they most likely will do fated for 3 months
[2:16:01] mavericks312: i think 10.2 is released before blizzcon personally

[2:22:10] Mallaes: 🧠
[2:23:21] Sielu11628: @kimmo_gaming very true. However, we have encrypted story in 10.1.7, a whole 10.2 patch (no clue who we are facing, yet, but we can assume), then 10.2.5/.7 patches for story/content, and maybe 10.3? 10.3 or not, there’s time and the incarnates don’t “need” to all die in DF.

[2:24:46] kimmo_gaming: @Sielu11628 I agree with everything but if we have 1 more raid and all 3 incarnates still alive, we cant just fight them through storyline, we have to face them in raid somehow
[2:24:55] AndorfineLive: with the story told by now, where do you think the story is going in the next expansion? titans?
[2:25:17] Redpandalol: farrak is low key pretty sick. just a muclear bomb with a chaotic attitude
[2:25:35] strike879: doesnt need to be raid could also defeat and drive off in a dungeon

[2:25:53] Redpandalol: that centaur from the cut scene got worked
[2:25:59] mavericks312: fyrakk is just a crackhead death lover
[2:26:19] Sielu11628: Fyrakk is the Fandaniel
[2:26:23] Redpandalol: fyrrak is just here for that action. flames rated e for everyone
[2:26:44] kimmo_gaming: @mavericks312 I agree with that as well, iridikron might be Azshara like character, just going though, but we will see
[2:27:16] Emerenix: He is probably some plan of the jailer that just moved too slow...
[2:27:21] Affiiance: Morning fam towHAMUP

[2:28:10] abracka_: illidan lands with sargeras behind him
[2:28:13] abracka_: crowd loses their shit
[2:28:15] enhance37: did you see that blizzard is doing something at gamescom?
[2:28:25] Sielu11628: Don’t forget, we have a whole encrypted storyline in 10.1.7 coming. Also, Tyr storyline, aspects still need their aspectral power back, and we have green/red dragon stories left (whether that’s 10.2 and/or 10.2+ content).
[2:28:30] Phoxzy: Sword, what sword?
[2:28:39] enhance37: 2 weeks from now, lavendervarya hyped it up on twitter

[4:17:12] botscast: ion said they dont want the fastest way to gear a char is to play another char
[4:18:01] mavericks312: i cant use flightstones fast enough lol

[4:18:56] flookguy: yeah im legit getting burned out running 17s on 5 alt tanks bro. Its legit insane and Im sitting on like 30 crests on my main tank
[4:19:18] mavericks312: i think catch up gear is fine i think ion draws the line at progression level gear

[4:22:37] FufkinsCombover: I think he said that they don't like having to use an addon to deal with "unearned" (not his words) gear
[4:22:45] robokall: Daddy Blizz Can do no wrong!!!
[4:22:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I say if you do everything on your main, 100%, then an alt should be at like 90% of that quick
