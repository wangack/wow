[0:17:04] BEANorMAN: @Malomycat they are [playing hardcore
[0:17:06] ravic8: @Malomycat cus its perma death and it takes aaaages to level up and gear up again

[4:39:56] Potsie123: can't do this in hc
[4:39:59] kingcrimsen: lmao
[4:40:02] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: yeah its like a 200 mob farm
[4:40:14] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: practice
[4:40:14] Potsie123: this is how they boosted ppl in classic
[4:40:18] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: if you can on like era
[4:40:18] PaperbackWritter: looks fun
[4:40:21] Potsie123: but that's why they made mob xp nothing
[4:40:22] BatmanHellbent: there's this really good farm called g2g
[4:40:34] nickwtfzorz: used to do this back in classic, I really cant rec you not do any dungeon farms in hc
[4:40:36] nickwtfzorz: this or zf

[4:41:58] ookthar_zug: zg aint bad, safe spots can be a little tricky
[4:42:11] ookthar_zug: o wait i meant zf, nvm
[4:42:20] nickwtfzorz: zg is honestly not that dangerous if you're good and precise on movements but its so risky on a raiding toon
[4:42:40] nickwtfzorz: you do need some raid gear for it though to be good and be hit capped
[4:43:10] Shigglefits: learning thses in HC would be very scary
[4:43:35] ookthar_zug: i would practice on a private server first
[4:43:47] nickwtfzorz: you honestly need an epic mount to even consider it
[4:43:49] nickwtfzorz: yeah
[4:44:00] DarkMeos: cobalts "this is how i die"
[4:44:38] Potsie123: LOL
[4:44:40] Potsie123: he is
[4:44:43] BatmanHellbent: I feel like ZF is way less sketchy and you can take it slow
[4:44:49] Potsie123: u have to pull at a certain time
[4:44:53] Potsie123: so those guys dont walk into u
[4:45:33] nickwtfzorz: a good safe method is to farm eko's in ws or materials used in consumes. its not as lucrative as boosting but low risk
