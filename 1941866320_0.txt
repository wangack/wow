[0:52:04] Turbotree: what server are you on? and what faction? @Swifty

[0:52:58] J_eggs: i think they fixed
[0:53:33] JattixTV: The "nerf" was for a bug, it use to not remove the buff so you had that run speed buff 100% of time and that was never intended
[0:53:49] kbradderz97: switfy i love you
