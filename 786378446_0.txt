[1:04:40] Neowanderer: sus they slide into dodge cyberpunk
[1:04:41] Blackhaxx: @Towelliee but the real question is, is it now rdy ?
[1:04:46] Affiiance: No way
[1:04:47] MrGattz: yeah ofc..
[1:04:47] Fireahwk: The AMD never before seen WoW clips date kinda gave the invasion away
[1:04:47] masterofcuckits: YES
[1:04:48] Shrenko: they can
[1:04:48] Thoreya: no shot
[1:04:49] Dark_lite7: Dec 8th would have been better for me
[1:04:50] Thoreya: lmao
[1:04:50] TheRiwen: yes
[1:04:51] Collected1: its possible but unlikely
[1:04:53] nl_Jewfro: Less than a month away and still no invasion
[1:04:53] swordart_19: Nope

[1:04:55] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: possible
[1:04:56] winchez_: of course its their game!!
[1:04:58] MrGattz: what
[1:04:58] Neowanderer: can you cap to max level in beta yet?
[1:04:58] Sh4nti: Activision will never allow it
[1:04:58] Antdavs24: they coould 100% delay again if they need to
[1:04:59] comicbookrican: They Better not LOL
[1:05:01] rottisxd: there wasnt any actual changes during this delay
[1:05:01] Uhrm: Possible, but unprobable
[1:05:02] spookyfacegaming: They can, but if they did, it would be a shitshow
[1:05:02] PToastman: I’d cry
[1:05:02] NonGloriaFero: Idk Sloot says he feels its as ready as any other expansion
[1:05:03] Tripnbunz: hi towelliee
[1:05:03] Thoreya: i give that 0% chance
[1:05:03] comicbookrican: omg
[1:05:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: cyberpunk is proving anything is possible
[1:05:05] TheUnknowing: Anything is possible, i just hope it doesnt happen
[1:05:05] Thoreya: of that happening
[1:05:06] Horuseternal69: yeah they can and they should the beta is still fucked from what i've been reading/seeing
[1:05:08] DavidBrutal123: im not re=scheduling my vacation for the third time, fck that
[1:05:08] Neowanderer: isnt one of the raid bosses still broken
[1:05:10] ZyntosAran: that would be really stupid
[1:05:10] Collected1: Preach was pretty downbeat in his video. he thinks its still too soon.
[1:05:14] MattJ063: to release on WoW 16th anniversary seems like a precise choice by Blizz
[1:05:16] Grunton: not really would be very pr bad
[1:05:20] DallTV_: Neowanderer xD
[1:05:22] PToastman: Once they start the invasion
[1:05:22] masterofcuckits: There would probably be backlash this time though
[1:05:30] Sh4nti: It has to be this quarter so unless they release around Xmas time I doubt it
[1:05:45] DigitalChill: as long as its 2020 your damn right its possible lol
[1:05:46] 2MakeMe: @Towelliee you hear bout the POE patch being delayed because of Cyberpunk? lol
[1:05:51] Neowanderer: @DallDK yo
[1:05:55] MonarchTeaV: it's going to be a 60 hour game and then everyone will forget it lol
[1:05:57] TheRiwen: it will be good :)
[1:05:58] rusty414: let just hope it hope it is good
[1:06:01] iceproxx: its 16 hour single player game
[1:06:02] dracullus: @Towelliee and you don't know where train hits
[1:06:04] Villie: everyones scared what happened to no mans sky/fallout 76
[1:06:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Well look what they did to titanfall 2, released it in between battlefield and cod. amazing game that got underrated because of poor release timing
[1:06:12] Thoreya: PoE saw what happened with classic
[1:06:14] iceproxx: you gonna play it for 3 days and forget about it
[1:06:16] DallTV_: have you seeing the way ppl are threating ppl there work on cyperpunk ? :S
[1:06:16] Thoreya: that was bad
[1:06:19] Shrenko: Im happy with the new launch date, perfect for us EU people @Towelliee
[1:06:20] Brodih_: the 16h is for the main mission only
[1:06:22] spookyfacegaming: Blizz would never admit it. Being all cagey
[1:06:23] fleaxo: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:06:24] 2MakeMe: the POE developers actually want to play Cyberpunk lol
[1:06:25] croppeast: Dont worry GearBox. I love CDPR, but i think its gonna be a 2021 release
[1:06:25] Thoreya: that was their worst season
[1:06:26] Sh4nti: Cyberpunk is a big yikes dev-side
[1:06:26] Thoreya: ever
[1:06:31] Horuseternal69: yeah classic wow they bombed seriously hard

[1:06:42] Villie: true gamer
[1:06:42] Grunton: no one wants to release against the giant of games
[1:06:46] PToastman: I’m worried the enemies in cyberpunk will be bullet spongey
[1:06:46] comicbookrican: I'll be like like that episode of family guy where Strewy takes a cab, bus plane and knoces on Blizzards door, slaps them "NOT FUNNY " LOL
[1:06:46] 2MakeMe: no turkey?
[1:06:47] HammerOfHartz: I’m not hyped for cyber punk at all, just not into that , prefer high fantasy

[1:07:48] Antdavs24: lol going to be at our vaca home so im SoL unless i play on my macbook towFeelsbad
[1:07:51] Layercake: Companies want the biggest ROI in their release games , ofc they are going to always check where Cyberpunk is gonna release. Its just makes sense
[1:07:51] ellazyturtle: Question: Once the go the shadowlands are we able to leave? or is it the case of which ever character we choose is 'stuck' in there?
[1:07:52] Uhrm: PoE has more to gain from delaying until January besides just dodging the Cyberpunk release date. More time for QA on the next league, more time off for their employees over the holidays
[1:07:55] PToastman: I still don’t know what I’m gonna main lol
[1:07:57] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee im sad bro im leveling in Silverpine forest and they took out the line where Garrosh called Sylvannis a bitch =(

[1:08:18] darkh79: I don't know why everyone makes such a big deal about thanksgiving - everyone stuffs themselves and then bolts for the couch to watch tv anyway
[1:08:19] SubQ: always in a coma while playing lol
[1:08:21] tulifau_: youll be able to leave @ellazyturtle
[1:08:23] MetallicusGaming: ellazyturtle you can leave
[1:08:24] iMaccaPro: what about D and terry, they still gonna be in the marathon?
[1:08:27] MrGattz: also POE is a free game. they have more to lose from trying to compete with large titles

[1:17:12] D3ception: of course they will not give bonus XP for 50+. 0%
[1:17:13] Dirrrtyalex: 16% would be huge for SL
[1:17:17] Staksor: they could just activate it for 1-50 only
[1:17:17] NexusOps: I doubt they will apply Xp boost to top 10 levels. They will enable it surely just for 0-50
[1:17:20] ShadoodHD: 16 years... fuck
[1:17:20] Xerevil: no way the xp buff will be active lol
[1:17:22] Drestrein: Prob will only work for players under 50 would be my guess
[1:17:30] Evilbreed83: that xp buff is the solution to the leveling issues in shadowlands. That's their fix Kappa

[1:22:29] Madnezz123: thats why there are patches. dont expect everything to work 100% correctly on launch
[1:22:31] TheUnknowing: they have done it @CoreMan510
[1:22:34] Zestusuka: Does the pilgrams bounty provide anything for leveling? That starts on the same day :P
[1:22:34] thestromus: Thanks pal

[1:23:41] Staksor: BfA launch was smooth af LUL

[1:23:53] ShadoodHD: dafuq's WoD
[1:23:53] Staksor: probably confused BfA with WoD LULW
[1:23:55] BramishEU: BFA was an aweful launch on Draenor 😂
[1:23:55] Coriollis: and progression
[1:23:56] terribalgamer: MoP was a disaster, WoD was pretty bad too
[1:23:57] bobojankinz: WoD plz
[1:23:58] cedemusic: in BFA launch, we couldn't log in for hours :(
[1:23:59] KingSlayerYotam: each normal island is 1.5 lvles at that range, just try one @Towelliee , takes 10 min each
[1:23:59] Shrenko: EU Draenor was fucked
[1:24:00] dracullus: @Towelliee it's crowd mentality, BFA BAD EVERYTHING ABOUT BFA BAD
[1:24:00] MetallicusGaming: EU-Draenor is full ofc it's gonna be a shitshow

[1:24:03] brozzy: quinStop
[1:24:05] Howells_tv: Illidan has never had a smooth launch
[1:24:07] Evilbreed83: @Towelliee did you hear about the new horde leveling route that gets you to 50 in under 6 hours?
[1:24:11] Jimmo_TV: BFA launch was the best memories, about 2 weeks in people started getting the shits with the game
[1:24:14] sillen142: On EU it was horrible at BfA launch. Stormsong valley crashed you after 30 seconds of being in the zone.
[1:24:15] R2RHIN0: I wish you were live yesterday so we could have seen your reaction to the release date announcement
[1:24:21] Thoreya: im terrified of illidan on launch day
[1:24:21] ShadoodHD: thats cause yall chose some high ass populated server when BFA launched KEKW
[1:24:22] Thoreya: its gonna be so bad
[1:24:25] tocu: it was only that quest though
[1:24:27] SicariusGTV: Still kinda surprised that there hasnðt been a shadowlands launch test like they did for legion and BfA
[1:24:29] parlangua89: Where as mop you couldn’t play first night legit
[1:24:31] TheRiwen: mop was fine

[1:24:48] LSBreed: it was a wowhead article
[1:24:49] khaz92: BfA was ok on EU on my end, draenor on the other hand was complete shit
[1:24:55] Skizzurp: which xpack was it that had the helicopter quest that every1 got stuck on for hours?
[1:24:56] Boombadier: Boombadier subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:25:01] haderdaraide: So when you hit 40 you go to one of the lower classic zones to finish?
[1:25:02] kbeltz85: Draenor was shit for everyone involved
[1:25:02] Pallananana: i just love we have WM now... alot of people make it their goal to just grief at beginquests during launch
[1:25:10] Vodrin: WoD was really rough start @LoneStalker_ ... there was that queue for a quest to open the locked orc... and the garrison problems lasted 2 weeks
[1:25:12] MrGattz: its not REALLY under 6 hours. you have to be very very luck with rare spawns and you have to min max potions. and know exactly where to go @Towelliee
[1:25:14] Sotonian: Meant to be faster than AAP
[1:25:15] wickedmgg: stress test for the event
[1:25:18] BramishEU: My best is 8hr33min on Alliance, full heirloom, xp flasks and followed WoD.
[1:25:19] BearOfLight: @LoneStalker_ for leveling and flavor, I agree WoD is amazing. The content draught and the flop that was tanaan was what really killed it.
[1:25:20] Thoreya: https://www.wowhead.com/news=318819/new-speed-leveling-route-from-level-10-to-50-in-under-6-hours

[1:25:31] ShadoodHD: wod was a bit of a shitshow with a hint of garrison bug
[1:25:59] Khalor__: the path works without rares, it just takes a bit longer
[1:25:59] Staksor: WoD launch was the worst
[1:26:05] Synopsix: Wod was just a shitshow alltogether
[1:26:06] andurian01: The garrison bug..
[1:26:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: The real shitshow was BC the first few months

[1:26:18] kbeltz85: remember during WoD having to go the stockades and aggro a mob to stay in combat so i didnt get logged out because you couldnt log back in most times
[1:26:21] Aquadriel: how will SL launch be? with everyone (horde and alli) in the same zone and place lvling. How will faction tag affect on quest mobs etc? @Towelliee
[1:26:22] Autoexeq: Shadowlands feels like it'll be the most hated expansion yet. #oracle

[1:56:11] Auru: realistically they have 1-2 beta builds
[1:56:11] TheUnknowing: I mean how much more can they do in tuning with 3 weeks left?
[1:56:15] Auru: they cant release some buggy shit
[1:56:16] Gluwc: warriors should be #1 tank imo ;)
[1:56:19] Rev_4_Life: they probably have 2 beta builds that havent been release yet also

[1:57:09] Boomhauwer: Boomhauwer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months!

[1:57:56] geokouts: i will renew my sub 1 week before expantion
[1:57:57] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee CB2077 will be delayed once more, 3 weeks does not give em enough time to release for 9 platforms, and their delays affect other games
[1:57:58] thestromus: Dude i fucking hate activision
[1:57:58] BramishEU: No way would they have given a release date this time if there was a chance of a delay
[1:58:06] winteckxlr: that would cost another couple million
[1:58:06] Rev_4_Life: if they delay it again im honestly going to think long and hard about quitting for good.
[1:58:08] SynnZero: It looks like they are trying to get the most viewing audience. With everything being delayed and at the end of the year all these games are coming out. More games coming out means less of an audience.
[1:58:09] Odinslayer: thoughts about raids release in holidays?
[1:58:14] thestromus: Activision been fucking with WoW for years
[1:58:15] Lingermastah15: bet the people excited for cyberpunk AND shadowlands are pretty upset now lmao

[1:59:17] yogibearz: @Towelliee i think its 1 hour earlier
[1:59:17] SynnZero: It calls you back slowly. Then you got a itch to scratch and need that crack fix.
[1:59:18] sharie: on Launch date i didnt play wow for more then 2 Months but i will certainly play Shadowlands
[1:59:24] ventu105: @kriticoal lol

[2:01:34] Yerpaysse: hey, i want a reason to buy PS5, what games would be worth buying in your opinion?
[2:01:47] FatChase: Me and my m+ team used beta to learn the dungeons and mechanics and read the story before release so we can blast it

[2:05:23] thebakeriscomingforu: The only thing that will kill WoW is when blizz drags the servers out back and smashes them.

[2:14:43] Zettabyte: not like when watching the NFL @Towelliee sometimes it feels like watching the ads more than the actual game itself towLul
[2:14:44] vylh: well theres a reason mainstream tv mostly died

[2:20:34] LiveFromStua: Strimmers get paid more for playing unwanted ads LUL
[2:20:35] Antdavs24: lol commercials are not endorsements
[2:20:35] tetrahydridodinitrogen: if no one plays a political commercial everyone is much happier
[2:20:49] Goschenk: not only that, but also ads are different per country
[2:20:49] t_train_va: Let you pick 50% of the commercials and let Twitch random the rest
[2:20:49] daddy_dolby: @Towelliee Streamers could always pick and twitch forces a random ad within the ones you selected as well
[2:20:51] Skizzurp: they do it where the adds u click to run are skewed to a certain set and the preroll and midroll adds are random
[2:20:52] BubblePriest: I can't wrap my head around the idea that half of (nearly) all subs isnt enough
[2:20:53] theriverdawn: i find tinder adds offense twitch!

[2:21:20] Skizzurp: the condom commercial is funny cuz it looks like a CoD loadout screen
[2:21:23] Motivess: political ads on twitch is so annoying, 90% of people are to watch video games lol

[2:53:11] Crowzcut: @Towelliee mike tyson shoes coming out look nice
[2:53:14] WeaponII: SNKRS screwed you, too?
[2:53:18] pistachiomatt1: @theprawn26 yeah so essentially the chromie time acts as a place you can level 10-50 before doing Battle for Azeroth content if you bought that expansion. but what I would do as a new player is kind of do. new expansion as you make new characters. so say you make a warrior and do legion for your levelling, then maybe if you make a mage you can do mists of panderia and so on. I think most of the time you will reach 50 before actually completing everything in the respective expansions though
[2:53:21] FlexBumpchest: hell yeah, now all we need is wheelies
[2:53:26] dimofodi: Just because they make them doesn't mean they're going to make a comeback.
[2:53:31] eldercandle: you should say fuck it and get some fat skate shoes lol
[2:53:32] buffretpaladins: the nike shocks?
[2:53:33] Brodih_: get pumps tp jump higher when playing basketball!
[2:53:33] obabathundae: oh lord .... Cena getting back too ?

[2:53:54] Kisswani: damn
[2:53:54] Grunton: oof
[2:53:54] Doqx42: I had Air Jordan V growing up, lasted less than 6 months, so disappointed in the shoes lol
[2:54:03] DadLearnsASkill: @Towelliee nube here. apparently new players are to choose which expansion to level up in. Which should i do??
[2:54:07] DWIGGHT: it will get worse @Towelliee
[2:54:10] manmower: how will you go outside without shoes in the meantime?
[2:54:13] PvtHudson093: yeah i had Air Jordans
[2:54:17] KatPiter: i had pumps for swimming and jumping in the blowhole at the cliffs when i was young LUL
[2:54:25] Eranel_: Personally I'd recommend going back for Loremaster.
[2:54:25] HokmanTV: Just enjoy the content
[2:54:27] pistachiomatt1: I said legion
[2:54:27] Sh4nti: BC LUL
[2:54:32] razilius21: true
[2:54:32] Eranel_: I'm cleaning up what I need on it.
[2:54:33] pistachiomatt1: Legion seems fun for new players
[2:54:34] easy_wheezy: don't level in wrath. Lots of quests that have a "one at a time" bottleneck
[2:54:36] TyndiVelspaz: Good god! I'll never pay more than $75 for new shoes.
[2:54:36] laughinbuddha: First timers cant choose
[2:54:37] Webw0lf359: if its first time then it has to be BFA
[2:54:42] TheOnly1289dude: wrath
[2:54:44] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee you have to level in BFA your first time
[2:54:46] Razb: and you get achivements
[2:54:49] Kisswani: @theprawn26 new players have to go through BfA , for your next characters you can choose
[2:54:50] TheRiwen: i only buy snikers when the ones i have has no butten longer
[2:54:51] bukka_hot: waste of time to read leveling guides
[2:54:51] razilius21: I recommend legion to start up so you can get the class mount and weapon skins
[2:54:52] DadLearnsASkill: @Towelliee as im a nube i dont know which expansion offers what
[2:54:55] Grunton: fastest means nothing its a few hours
[2:54:59] dirtygrimace: that bot buying situation sounds extremely unfair @Towelliee I wish there was some way around that
[2:55:02] preza36: i would say legion because of artifacts in case you don't have them
[2:55:03] EthicalHermit: I just use aap for the auto quest pickup/complete
[2:55:04] KingSlayerYotam: legion is good to lvl, my favorite
[2:55:06] Webw0lf359: @theprawn26 you have to do Bfa the first time
[2:55:10] Extex31: obsessing over shoes and paying 700+ for them is extremly crazy. people and their families living half a year in some countries with that much $
[2:55:11] Razb: i actually leveling my first alliance character is BFA so its fine
[2:55:15] カナココ: you'll hit 50 even before you finish bfa
[2:55:17] Kisswani: BfA is not bad leveling
[2:55:19] FattBeard: I like doing BfA because the quests have great flow to them.
[2:55:25] Razb: never played trough BFA ally story
[2:55:26] xApplemaNx: Desmephisto just got a new record by using classic zones for most of his leveling
[2:55:34] DadLearnsASkill: @Towelliee so....is it then a case of just doing all the new stuff? cos i cant go back and do everything
[2:55:35] maddhatterr: Im doing MOP on my zanad paladin right now - reliving it. WOD seems to be the fastest if you have all the heirloom gear, potions and stuff, but its just fun to relive some of the old expantions if youre not rushing
[2:55:35] DehCantao: @theprawn26 You need at least one level 50 char to choose what xpac to level on. For your first character you have to level through BFA content.
[2:55:35] pistachiomatt1: @theprawn26 oops forgot about that, yeah you need to level through BFA your first time playing, after that you have free reign
[2:55:38] Molgoran: Thanks for the stream Towelliee. At home with Corona and this is a great distraction. Cheers from the UK.
[2:55:45] belsebuub: I just try to do zones that i havent done with that armor class/faction
[2:55:45] GamingDad77: BFA is also good for unlocking allied races
[2:55:47] Eranel_: If you do A/H BFA stuff, you get a frostwolf/a crap horse as well.
[2:55:47] mmo_kenna_: Flip life
[2:55:48] othraerir: they are jerks, they do it with concert tickets too
[2:55:49] Ludovangret: I work at best buy and resellers go there for pc also, it's all over the place now.
[2:55:51] BrennieV: I chose BFA because I can do the achievement for the Zandalari Race
[2:55:58] BoezIRL: if I don't level in bfa do I have to do the war campaign to unlock world quest and the new zones?
[2:56:03] CaptainLittlelily: cold less sunlight
[2:56:06] FlexBumpchest: are all classic zones lvl 30 or they scale?
[2:56:08] MrGattz: nope. thats not it.
[2:56:08] Voidheim: its flaring up because dumb ass people
[2:56:08] Evoca85: It's because schools opened up

[2:56:20] TheRiwen: dum people
[2:56:20] laughinbuddha: Going to rallies cough cough
[2:56:21] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee its because people are dumbasses and done wear their masks.
[2:56:21] CipansR_Ayaya: theres more dumbas people
[2:56:22] coachingpotatoes: so much from schools too
[2:56:23] TheUnknowing: i dont feel like weather has anything to do with it, its flaring cause of people being idiots
[2:56:23] Grunton: people closer together in houses
[2:56:23] Berexios123: more testing = more cases
[2:56:23] jesuswasagreatman: Europe is shutting down too :>

[2:56:24] Kronosrebus: worst are when retail stores "raffle pairs but its jist a backdoor
[2:56:25] Eranel_: @Towelliee people keep in closer proximity and can't stay out, it's why flu season is usually now
[2:56:25] Brodih_: school is not helping

[2:56:48] TheRiwen: the young people dont care.
[2:56:53] belsebuub: less vitamin d
[2:56:54] Doqx42: Getting colder also means get colds and such which will then cause more testing to occur
[2:57:03] Drakenking: @berexios123 ok trump, except that's not the case it's also % of positive tests that have skyrocketed, we just had 85k cases in 24h and you think thats from testing alone
[2:57:05] Drakenking: crazy
[2:57:07] manmower: folks in college just don't care about anyone but themselves, they're superspreaders
[2:57:11] Shrenko: @Phytonical no politics here :D

[3:39:29] cavi_XD: are most classes set now?
[3:39:36] AdoraVal: Well they just fixed a week long bug I had in beta where I couldn't even get into Torghast as that last revendreth quest
[3:39:41] TexValhalla: there are so many things coming out within that week-2 week period now NotLikeThis
[3:39:45] Drakenking: it refunds a conduit energy doesnt it
[3:39:47] Drakenking: as well
[3:39:51] czk_marcuss: @socks_05 The passives dosen't matter that much if You don't do content on pro level
[3:39:52] Rictamar: balance is scuffed and it is impossible to fix, but that is the reality we live in
[3:39:54] kreff_: @comicbookrican stripWot
[3:39:59] sigilla_: how do you feel about the raid release date?
[3:40:10] Drakenking: @Gylduran Its actually way more scuffed on prepatch live
[3:40:12] toastmask: Nothing better than a fresh towel in the morning!
[3:40:22] AdoraVal: I think LUL
[3:40:29] Drakenking: Because a lot of classes are missing upgrades to talents, legendaries, covenant abilities, conduits, etc
[3:40:30] Shrenko: here we go LUL
[3:40:33] theoriginalzinng: i dont envy the wowhead and icy veins guide writers for the next couple weeks
[3:40:35] Catspaw66: covenents azerite armor 2.0
[3:40:45] The_Hunter1_: Can anyone tell me how Ele sham is looking for DPS vs any mage class in Shadowlands?
[3:40:45] LegoCoin: understatement yeah questing needs alot of work
[3:40:48] dengueuk: i would rather them delay till november and fix the bugs tehn rush it out
[3:40:49] watchformoose: Hey towelliee, where did you find the artist that does your notifiers? My husband’s wants some professionally done for his stream....i want to surprise him for Xmas but idk where to start looking for someone to hire/commission
[3:40:50] Drakenking: That just seems like a minor bug

[3:40:51] Moobot: Thanks @CJ_SLIM for subbing for 4 months! towHAMUP
[3:40:57] Rictamar: @Drakenking even on beta there are still issues with the soulbinds and some classes that don't work
[3:41:04] Drakenking: I would just set up the 3 soulbinds to each spec
[3:41:08] LegoCoin: raids dont work yet LUL only get limtied testing but we have time on that
[3:41:15] Drakenking: You lose 1-2% efficiency from soulbind stuff but you wouldnt have to swap all the time
[3:41:22] Drakenking: Maybe a little more
[3:41:24] goldiesoulo: sounds restricting for no damn reason
[3:41:31] Mecabeast: pikaboo when he plays with viewers will swap specs like 20 times in a stream
[3:41:36] brozzy: its gonna be week/month before you unlock enough conduits to even have to worry
[3:41:36] kokochris: kokochris subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! ham up

[3:42:15] Dyriks: I wish they had a conduit that made me into a giant LUL
[3:42:22] SpilledMelk: feels weird how hard wow players go on min maxing when 90% of the game you could beat with your monitor turned off
[3:42:25] branTVx: does anyone have a recommended website to stay up to date on min/maxing stuff? i only know of scuffed ones
[3:42:29] Kisswani: hey changed it
[3:42:32] Diimiitrii31: I'm so scared of the expansion. I feel like it will suck for people who want to play multiple speccs on one character
[3:42:34] xApplemaNx: they need to let us in for 1 more round of raid testing, there have been MASSIVE reworks since we last were in there
[3:42:35] roflpotamus: @SpilledMelk what? lmao
[3:42:50] MILESkg21: MAX LUL
[3:42:58] Drakenking: @Mecabeast Yep and all it takes is setting up your soulbinds for different specs, most of the soulbinds do lend themselves a bit to one spec or another anyways already now that everyhing has been normalized with amount of conduit slots
[3:43:01] Dyriks: just wear a santa hat all the time then LUL
[3:43:13] Vch001: ONLY if you have a Pepe with a Santa hat
[3:43:20] jasperboy: @Diimiitrii31 I mean, thats been a problem since Legion, so.. We'll have to suck it up :D

[3:44:36] bestridethesun: "The twilight zone" :D
[3:44:38] brozzy: The only people not liking the new release are the people that were still testing beta
[3:44:39] TheRiwen: we just dont like so see a bfa exspansion again.

[3:45:01] Dujinni: Betalands Kappa
[3:45:02] Drakenking: yeah last raid testing classes werent fully formed really
[3:45:03] bestridethesun: What dark and horrific alternate timeline is this where people are not complaining on the Internet
[3:45:13] Diimiitrii31: @jasperboy did you have trouble swapping and optimizing speccs in bfa?
[3:45:15] aribellae: thanks :D
[3:45:17] Mostrocity: @Towelliee Would that make it more fun though with the unknown?
[3:45:22] jasperboy: @GamingDad77 Exactly!
[3:45:31] Galadeon: Activision told them they had enough testing time. Ship it.
[3:45:34] Menion01: Don’t worry the 16yr anniversary buff will fix the SL leveling curve.
[3:45:35] Diimiitrii31: @jasperboy also one reason why I didn't like legion at all^^
[3:45:36] branTVx: does anyone have a recommended website to stay up to date on min/maxing stuff? i only know of scuffed ones
[3:45:41] Coriollis: tuning KEKW
[3:45:43] starknadooo: I change specs all the time. When playing preist I change between holy and shadow often. Depending if I'm queing for a dungeon/raid or doing solo content.
[3:46:11] TheRiwen: more nerfs
[3:46:18] thickthighs91: just bring SP, AF locks, and MM Hunters only. EZ
[3:46:26] jasperboy: @Diimiitrii31 I had a few hickups since I wanted to try out survival back in Uldir and a few patches later when I wanted to try MM in eternal palace, but its true. BFA has been nice for "multispeccers"
[3:46:27] Drakenking: Gutted or made normal like serrated bone spike
[3:46:31] Thoreya: theyve been making good nerfs recently
[3:46:32] Varchon: @socks_05, the scuffed ones and the 'up to date' ones are pretty much identical...just go for icy-veins
[3:46:36] Drakenking: which was just astronomically broken
[3:46:43] Shrenko: less
[3:46:46] branTVx: @Varchon ty

[3:47:32] Drakenking: Its wows anniversary date tho
[3:47:36] Drakenking: That seems more likely
[3:47:37] Thoreya: idk i doubt it
[3:47:44] nimphtv: nov 23rd is my birthday jakbEYE
[3:47:45] sigilla_: had to get it out before the holidays for all the Christmas $$$$ all those kids and teens stuck at home because of covid will play video games
[3:47:46] roflpotamus: totally different games
[3:47:49] Drakenking: @Towelliee Nah AMD already leaked the date
[3:47:51] stormcount: prob just like how POE pushed back due to cyberpunk
[3:47:59] Drakenking: with their GPU announcements, the WoW video was slated for Nov 10th
[3:48:04] Razb: at least poe devs were honest
[3:48:08] jerexify: @Towelliee Have you been leveling in Westfall? Or do you go from EForest to Redridge?
[3:48:08] manmower: they got the balance where they wanted, so probably figured there isn't much else to do
[3:48:08] GamingDad77: @jasperboy I just don't get why people make such a big deal about it. It's my money and I refuse to have someone tell me how to play a game I pay for.
[3:48:09] truthe_yashikawa: AMD is Dec release i think
[3:48:10] thickthighs91: @Towelliee i still Wow will still take a hit from the release of that game regardless of release date
[3:48:11] bestridethesun: Haven't you consistently been saying that they don't care about Cyberpunk release? @Towelliee
[3:48:19] truthe_yashikawa: 6900XT looks pretty boss!
[3:48:19] FrankieSmiles: cod comes out 1 day before cyberpunk
[3:48:27] KingSlayerYotam: tbh i agree, they cant release SL with cp the same weekend
[3:48:32] Lexi__Marie: @Towelliee thats what i hate about business a game i dont care about affecting the release of a game i do
[3:48:34] roflpotamus: @bestridethesun thats what im saying lol
[3:48:36] Diimiitrii31: @starkson I always sign up for raids and mythics as all speccs I have on the character. so I don't know what I'm gonna play until I get accepted. It feels bad to have covernants and conduits making some speccs feel off
[3:48:38] Drakenking: Not related to cyberpunk at all lol
[3:48:45] Takobaited: ??? it's the most anticipated game of the year - of course companies will take note of that. Blizzard cares about active player numbers at launch
[3:48:53] LoseAlotLuke: Cyberpunk is massive, global interest
[3:48:54] PhillyDilly18: What if Cyberpunk gets delayed again? Does Shadowlands get delayed?
[3:48:56] Domi98_: poe got screwed by classic wow in blight league
[3:48:57] Heatiou: cyberpunk is signle player lol
[3:49:02] samooraijack: wow dosent fear anything
[3:49:03] Shrenko: they should care about Cyberpunk too
[3:49:03] Heatiou: it won't last long
[3:49:05] MILESkg21: D:
[3:49:06] Drakenking: LULW
[3:49:11] ToShoBro: That game isn't even guarunteed to be good
[3:49:12] jasperboy: @GamingDad77 Same here. I raid for Cutting Edge, and I still play what and how I want to. Most people are overreacting
[3:49:13] Sonatta: i'm ready for another YELLOW tweet LUL
[3:49:14] Coriollis: I expect them do delay CP2077 again on 10th dec
[3:49:16] stormcount: yea but blight league wasnt fun at 1st
[3:49:16] Pritamin: 2004 November 23 WoW launched
[3:49:17] Rictamar: yeh people severely understand how big Cyberpunk will be. Its the most anticipated game since RDR2
[3:49:17] XRedmartyrX: Hope not we dont need another Crackdown 3
[3:49:21] onryokie: Can't wait for CP2077 to come out so people stfu about it, honestly.
[3:49:24] slatester: @Towelliee is the holiday season going to mean easier bosses so it's cleared faster?
[3:49:25] LoseAlotLuke: that poor guy got BETRAYED @Towelliee
[3:49:25] Drakenking: It was the NEXT DAY
[3:49:26] Shrenko: haard fucking jebait
[3:49:26] swordwindgaming: why would they answer a question like that lol
[3:49:26] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:49:31] MetallicusGaming: Like I said before Cyberpunk will keep getting delayed untill 2077 Kappa LUL
[3:49:34] Kebabit0: KEKW
[3:49:35] t_train_va: Wasn't 3 weeks later, was literally hours later
[3:49:36] Rofyx: it was literally 20 hours later
[3:49:36] Collected1: based on this tweet i wouldn't rule out 2021. https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1322178315403276288
[3:49:38] ClassicMalcontent: Polish law prevented the board or leadership from telling 90% of the company they chose to delay.
[3:49:41] Drakenking: @swordwindgaming because media guys boss said yes 100% its this day
[3:49:45] ur_levelup: It might have to do with DCMA and in-game-music.. who knows.

[3:49:47] ImperioFortisHD: I booked off my 3 week vacation too @Towelliee FeelsBadMan
[3:49:48] Tazzyy: the game has to live up to crazy hype now @Towelliee
[3:49:54] PToastman: I just hope cyberpunk has good gameplay
[3:49:58] Bksuppan: @onryokie SeemsGood
[3:50:01] cheesecroissant: twitter guy probably didnt know anything
[3:50:02] Drakenking: Taking vacation for game release dates during a pandemic
[3:50:09] Drakenking: thats some spicy gambling
[3:50:14] starknadooo: @Diimiitrii31 Yeay and trying to do solo content as a holy is painful let me tell you.
[3:50:14] jerexify: @Towelliee Have you been leveling in Westfall, or going from Elwynn to Redridge?
[3:50:16] roflpotamus: Game is gonna be a big letdown I bet
[3:50:21] ClassicMalcontent: They could only announce the delay to the mid-mgmt and devs after a certain time.
[3:50:23] Sonatta: i bet it's delayed because of Stadia
[3:50:27] Wugrok: they can just skip Stadia i wouldnt mind Kappa
[3:50:38] Trawkey: They have optimazation problems with Xbone and Ps4
[3:50:41] Lexi__Marie: dont xavius blizzard
[3:50:41] Kakotan2143: I Think Cyberpunk is taking forever cause they decided to add a MP element to the game, I don't think that is needed
[3:50:48] Coriollis: Toweliee CP2077 was already GOLD so whatever it was must be severe
[3:51:05] Drakenking: Well just change our raid days
[3:51:05] LoseAlotLuke: @Towelliee check cyberpunk twitter they've had a bad week according to their own twitter lol @Towelliee
[3:51:08] ClassicMalcontent: @Kakotan2143 they want to have a GTA-like CyberPunk 2077 Online presence.
[3:51:27] Trawkey: Cyberpunk is ready for pc and next gen. Atleast they said so in a post recently
[3:51:33] Grunton: I want raid to take forever like firelands
[3:51:35] kokochris: @coriollis current gen consoles is the reason
[3:51:50] ClassicMalcontent: @Kakotan2143 online is a lot of potential $$$. Too much to pass up. And yeah the delay said due to current-gen console optimizations.
[3:51:51] Kakotan2143: I dont think they will pull it off they make great single player games and they should stick to that , imo @ClassicMalcontent :/
[3:51:51] khai_kobayashi: I used to hate westfall. Depressing place.
[3:51:52] foxdie889: @Towelliee What are you waiting for here?
[3:52:00] Thoreya: as much as people love delays theres also a lot of people that get tired of that shit after a while
[3:52:01] ClassicMalcontent: @Kakotan2143 we'll see.
[3:52:03] tomloy: You doing a 24hr stream for launch @towelliee ??
[3:52:06] kokochris: @foxdie889 mount.
[3:52:11] EternalGloryx: With Covid they should be pumping game, TV and Movie content, like this is literally their opportunity
[3:52:14] Coriollis: @kokochris when u announce gold for your product it means the master disc ready and already printing for every platform
[3:52:15] thatsaspiceymeataball: they also said no more delays
[3:52:19] LoseAlotLuke: until im preloading it on steam i dont trust anything
[3:52:24] nomad_91: @tomloy 10 day marathon for launch
[3:52:30] Uther_The_Lightbringer: theres no more depressing place like original desolace
[3:52:31] Redpandalol: @Towelliee i had to tame oondasta on 2 of my hunters
[3:52:39] kokochris: @coriollis not anymore. it used to be like that. that's why we have day 1 patches.
[3:52:41] DaxxTMI: Towelliee - what website do you use for Raid Shadow Legends specs?
[3:52:43] Redpandalol: i just had to
[3:52:45] Kakotan2143: yeah i wont be buying CP2077 until 2021, i will be playing WoW for the rest of this year lol
[3:52:54] 3dRes: Current gen is holding the game back. It's embarrassing
[3:52:58] grizzlyhorn: i logged into a toon to kill oondasta and i just see a hunter standing right where it spawns with no pets
[3:52:59] Coriollis: @kokochris I see well better get on with the times than
[3:53:00] Zettabyte: in Russia @Towelliee you don't tame the dinosaur, the dinosaur tames you Kappa
[3:53:03] ClassicMalcontent: "Day 0" is launch day patching basically.
[3:53:04] Drakenking: I have godfall from when I bought my GPU
[3:53:05] Mr_Pennywise_: towBolvar
[3:53:06] kokochris: @coriollis we consider gold now to be minimum viable product.
[3:53:19] kayoznite: ey ive recently started playing resto and ele shaman hoping to main this class for SL will i have to keep changing covenant for each of the spec?
[3:53:29] TheOnly1289dude: who knows cyberpunk 2077 mat not be released until 2077
[3:53:29] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[3:53:30] ClassicMalcontent: Day 1 is the day after launch. Just FYI on how software releases are termed.
[3:53:33] foxdie889: yes
[3:53:34] LoseAlotLuke: ye
[3:53:35] jure__: yea
[3:53:37] snipzzq: +
[3:53:37] TheOnly1289dude: may
[3:53:38] Darzetti_: yea
[3:53:39] xApplemaNx: yeah
[3:53:43] Armdel: should be ye
[3:53:49] MILESkg21: 250GB OMEGALUL
[3:53:51] Kakotan2143: my suggestion is, DONT Anyone waste 60.00 on Watch Dogs Legion :P game isn't worth it
[3:54:04] Diimiitrii31: @kayoznite you cannot change covenant for every specc, since it takes 2 weeks to do so. you will have to pick a covernant that has an OK skill for both speccs
[3:54:06] ClassicMalcontent: Time to get another 4TB Samsung 860 Evo (or Pro)
[3:54:09] Ibloodraven: cold war is 250
[3:54:12] large_kahuna: 178 gb acccording to sources
[3:54:21] LoseAlotLuke: they announced the cold war file sizes already
[3:54:21] othraerir: i only have 250 total :(
[3:54:21] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee I finally uninstalled Anthem and saved 80 gigs
[3:54:22] MILESkg21: it is if you have UPLAY+
[3:54:24] DeanoTV: get uplay+ sub, can play it for a month
[3:54:24] moonscryer: covenants LUL
[3:54:25] roflpotamus: Kappa
[3:54:26] Kakotan2143: hehehe
[3:54:26] Kisswani: I saw Dan play it . it looked great imo
[3:54:28] kayoznite: @Diimiitrii31 thank you
[3:54:28] Drakenking: Watchdogs looks OK but not great
[3:54:28] Strayer_J: its fun enough
[3:54:30] ClassicMalcontent: They are back around $549 (near lowest price ever again) for the 4TB Samsung 860 Evo
[3:54:34] samaelulu: if fun.. i like it
[3:54:35] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee it looks terrible tbh
[3:54:41] mmrghost7: anthem LUL
[3:54:41] Drakenking: @Kisswani it does LOOK great, but the story is a little clunky
[3:54:46] MILESkg21: yes
[3:54:48] Fibus: yes you c an
[3:54:49] dragothicx: yes you can
[3:54:51] Harusame12: im enjoying it so far
[3:54:53] foxdie889: have you seen the updates they are coming out for Anthym?
[3:55:01] LoseAlotLuke: DLSS is pure hacks that tech gives you like 30-40 fps for free wtf @Towelliee
[3:55:01] DeanoTV: it looks fun but AI is so messed up watched cohh play it
[3:55:03] Strayer_J: its GTA in london, bruv
[3:55:06] Sprucemoose: @foxdie889 legit excited to try anthem again
[3:55:08] RogueBear: i uninstalled when the info came out about their employee abuse
[3:55:09] MILESkg21: it only looks like shit if you have an ACTUAL POTATO
[3:55:09] dragothicx: Newest Nvidia drivers should be a huge improvement for Watch Dogs Legion apparently
[3:55:11] ImperioFortisHD: rtx is hardcore forced dlss is software forced
[3:55:11] Kisswani: @Drakenking ah could be , but i like the mechanics of it
[3:55:11] Drakenking: Its the nature of having any npc be able to be an character,, it's good but not GOTY contender I think
[3:55:12] Sh4nti: DLSS is for weaker GPUs
[3:55:12] kayoznite: one more question im kinda new to wow is ele shaman going to be good in SL?
[3:55:17] Kakotan2143: Saw Coh playing it, He didnt look impressed with anything out of the visuals, I wasn't impressed and i loved Watch Dogs 1 and 2
[3:55:24] swordwindgaming: content is boring and formulaic though, pretty disappointing for a $60 AAA game
[3:55:41] Drakenking: @swordwindgaming Unfortunately how I feel about a lot of Ubi titles
[3:55:42] FLCLfan: Legion seems top be pretty unpolished
[3:55:51] Oswanov: DLSS is AI Resolution Upscaling, so yeah, better performance
[3:55:53] MILESkg21: MTX is king Kappa
[3:56:00] KonradGM: DLSS renders game at lower resolution and fills in the blanks at highier, not exactly being full accurate here but idea is simmilair
[3:56:08] Ragevamp666: 10-15 bucks yea
[3:56:10] jasperboy: @kayoznite Dont quote me, but I think ele will be some what ok in SL
[3:56:14] Howells_tv: the best part is you can
[3:56:15] TheRiwen: it is ubisoft so no
[3:56:16] Rictamar: and people somehow are more excited about Valhalla than Cyberpunk, despite Watch Dogs being meh
[3:56:21] FerociouzMonk: watch dogs is meh at best. 1 and 2 is superior to legion. id say get watch dogs legion when its 75% off
[3:56:23] pedrobosseljon: Ele is pretty good yes
[3:56:30] Sovekz: Well, if CDPR did that he wouldn't be saying anything
[3:56:33] LoseAlotLuke: people still get mad at paid cosmetics?
[3:56:37] Oriqqs: Ya I'm pretty much over MTX convo, people clearly spend money on them so they aren't going away.
[3:56:40] pedrobosseljon: im sad they nerdfed our proc rate though
[3:56:42] Strayer_J: not that i saw
[3:56:47] Kisswani: there are ingame currecies . not sure if you use it for everything
[3:56:49] Zorgolong: The "4 weeks vip status" for ultimate edition kinda worries me LUL
[3:56:49] foxdie889: @Towelliee What do you think about Blizz selling Transmog sets for WoW?
[3:56:50] samaelulu: it has in gmae currency
[3:56:50] kokochris: and here I am, happy icewind dale enhanced edition is on sale. been a while since I played the dale series.
[3:56:50] LarcenousLaugh: *Jim Sterling voice* OH UBISOFT!
[3:56:51] Trafikk_: cash only
[3:56:53] MILESkg21: the same people that get mad over WOW Cash Shop
[3:56:55] samaelulu: but Ultimate gives everything
[3:56:58] Diimiitrii31: I saw sneaky playing it earlier and there was a line: "this guys face got smashed in" when he looked at a body and it was just a generic face with no wounds whatsoever^^
[3:57:06] MILESkg21: Aiden
[3:57:15] iAldo: sorry just got here, is that SL date confirmed?
[3:57:16] samaelulu: Aiden
[3:57:17] Drakenking: @Denndd just like any of the last 3 expansions you wont until later
[3:57:22] Kisswani: @iAldo yes
[3:57:23] Drakenking: @iAldo yes
[3:57:24] Ragevamp666: @Samael093 yes but he is asking if that currency can be used to buy the mtx stuff
[3:57:30] Feldecay: @ialdo yes
[3:57:36] Zettabyte: pathfinder PepeHands pepeMeltdown
[3:57:46] zinbers: @towelliee you mentioned you had a big announcement 2 days ago you where working on
[3:57:47] swordart_19: @Zettabyte towPog
[3:57:51] Drakenking: Pathfinder is the easiest shit
[3:57:55] Kisswani: isn't it ?
[3:57:57] FergusCreative: I think they said just renown
[3:57:58] swordart_19: Play game and you fly simple as that .
[3:57:58] kayoznite: oh thank god cause i thought i levled up this toon and everyone was saying priest is going to be most OP class in SL but i liked aesthetic of the shaman
[3:57:58] pedrobosseljon: Cash shops are the bane of modern gaming
[3:58:00] Drakenking: You just get it by playing the game
[3:58:01] DeanoTV: pathfinder but renown instead of rep
[3:58:01] Zettabyte: @swordart_19 towPog
[3:58:11] Rictamar: @orcnuts a game is not priced for how long it takes to make, but I understand what you are trying to say, skins should be cheap
[3:58:16] wet_wrinkle: You think wow will ever do a expansion that requires flying for the whole thing?
[3:58:35] TheRiwen: @kayoznite yea shaman is nice
[3:58:47] FergusCreative: No they said it will be available later
[3:58:52] swordart_19: You will not fly 1 year take it .
[3:58:54] Menion01: You have a year and a half to figure it out.
[3:58:54] Drakenking: @goob_newb That was BC bruv
[3:59:08] thickthighs91: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:59:08] Rictamar: they will never have flying right out of the gate because ppl will miss the art
[3:59:13] Drakenking: @goob_newb you got flying in the first zone and it was required to even get to a bunch of quest areas
[3:59:16] Collected1: does shadowlands have daily emisarries?
[3:59:27] paradoxTheDJ: bmac6996 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months! 
[3:59:28] Moobot: BMAC6996 WITH THE 69 YEARS towHAMUP
[3:59:31] Kisswani: I like the pathfinder system . I think it's fair
[3:59:36] furytrain: Yeah @Collected1
[3:59:37] wet_wrinkle: Ya that was great
[3:59:37] Rofyx: @Collected1 yes they are a dumber version of emissaries
[3:59:39] Kisswani: they are a bit more involved
[3:59:46] MILESkg21: 69 4Head nice
[3:59:50] Redpandalol: having to do pathfinder is boring. not bad....just boring. we have done it 3 times already
[3:59:51] executionerravencrest: @bmac6996 POG
[3:59:52] Drakenking: @Collected1 yeah but its like 3 dailies or fill a bar, but for instance those bars are filled 20% by some puzzle treasures
[3:59:59] DennisTried: are you gonna use the oondasta mount once you get it? @Towelliee
[4:00:00] FergusCreative: ferguscreative subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:00:00] Moobot: Thanks for subscribing for 6 months, @FERGUSCREATIVE towHAMUP
[4:00:01] Rictamar: @orcnuts yeh man, PoE is the greatest offender, but at least that game is free
[4:00:02] Drakenking: Treasures are way easier to fill the bar
[4:00:02] sifer007: LUL LUL LUL
[4:00:03] Hestert: do you think theyll have more patches per xpac or keep that same schedule as well?
[4:00:05] Drakenking: Takes you 3 minutes
[4:00:06] zinbers: Ok I look at it
[4:00:07] kokochris: KEKW
[4:00:12] paradoxTheDJ: pog?
[4:00:13] AstroStoleMars: @Towelliee thanks to you I finally started playing WoW first time here and loving it!
[4:00:17] brain_wash: these questions are crazy talk, ive watched so much content about this xpac by now omg, i thought we know all this
[4:00:21] Sovekz: That is not too bad
[4:00:22] kokochris: towLewd
[4:00:25] Kisswani: some " fill the bar " WQs took me like 10-15 minutes
[4:00:34] Kisswani: might be the respawn rate
[4:00:45] Deemadork: When do they usually allow max boosts after an xpac?
[4:00:46] kokochris: towHesaidit towFeelsgood
[4:00:57] TheRiwen: i hate bar filling quests. They are so boring
[4:00:57] BreastFriends: @SupeKitchen Cause everyone consumes as much content as you? :O
[4:00:58] skewiiie: how hard would it be to kill poundfist in Chromie Time 87k hp
[4:01:06] Kisswani: in Ardenweald as well i think
[4:01:10] Drakenking: @Kisswani Those should be adjusted but generally if you have one of the meta fill the bar quests the treasures on your zone map are 20% and become easy and routine
[4:01:11] Rictamar: can you do Torghast to level up on alts?
[4:01:16] AdoraVal: Yeah I got in the beta last week, and its been a pain trying to find things
[4:01:17] Takobaited: is the flappy-bird mini game a world quest? I saw it forever ago and wasn't sure if they kept it
[4:01:20] kokochris: of the rewards are worth it, I'm ok with the extra time
[4:01:30] Rictamar: boo
[4:01:30] Drakenking: @SyriSolord it is for kyrian area
[4:01:33] Motivess: are the world quests daily or weekly? @towelliee
[4:01:37] LoseAlotLuke: are these callings everyday? and what do they give? renown? @Towelliee
[4:01:40] Kisswani: @Drakenking part of it i think is that i'm not familiar with the terrain . it should get noticeably faster
[4:01:41] jerexify: Hey @Towelliee , have you been leveling in Westfall, or do you go from Elwynn to Redridge?
[4:01:42] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee if quest stuff is hard to find now in beta, do you think the smarter call would be to avoid launch week?
[4:02:06] Takobaited: @Drakenking ah ok, ty
[4:02:06] PToastman: I’m taking the week after launch week off
[4:02:15] Brodih_: was that a kamehameha ?
[4:02:15] CaptainJoeyNY: new 8 year mount grind eh?
[4:02:23] LoseAlotLuke: do the callings give renown?
[4:02:31] zinbers: The big issue is the maw still looks unfinished on preaches lasts video but they could fix that some time soon
[4:02:34] branTVx: @Towelliee what you sippin on?
[4:02:36] BebeauTV: dude i have to say you are the most consistent streamer in terms of schedule and views in ggeneral, good shit @Towelliee
[4:02:40] DispozableHero: I sold mythic ring for 200k
[4:02:40] OdyBro: lurkers band?
[4:02:42] CaptainJoeyNY: What mace is that?
[4:02:43] Drakenking: @Kisswani Yeah takes a bit, maldraxxus and revendreth can be particularly tricky
[4:02:53] Rictamar: people are worried about launch issues for some reason, when the last two launches I played day 1 with no major problems
[4:02:55] Lexi__Marie: whats the total at for number of 50s now?
[4:02:59] MetallicusGaming: that's almost a token in EU LUL
[4:03:01] Kisswani: @zinbers or it could just be the intended way for it to be like that
[4:03:04] DennisTried: are you gonna use the oondasta mount once you get it? @Towelliee
[4:03:06] ClassicMalcontent: ClassicMalcontent subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Hammer came DOWN and Squished our levels! That's how powerful that towHAMUP is when it lands. Kappa

[4:03:46] Ragevamp666: @CaptainJoeyNY yes
[4:03:47] Motivess: does anyone know if there are still 50 World Quests you need to do each day?
[4:03:49] Rictamar: @kr3ff Stormrage US, high pop, no real issues last two launches
[4:03:50] zinbers: You have a lot of tons to gear
[4:03:53] Zettabyte: heard sperg event for a sec there towLul
[4:04:03] Tzarvahl: @Gylduran I believe it's because the last two expansions they split up the players, by allowing them to pick a zone. This time around, everyone is in the same spot right?
[4:04:10] jerexify: Hey @Towelliee , do you level in Westfall, or have you been going from Elwynn to Redridge?
[4:04:13] AdoraVal: So when is the scourage event then?
[4:04:22] grizzlyhorn: shit im doing that already in mechagon 4Head
[4:04:23] Rictamar: @TheStankyBeard true, but they have phasing so it shouldn't be that bad
[4:04:26] MetallicusGaming: Nov 10th Val_Kyrie_Pixie
[4:04:28] CaptainJoeyNY: Demon souls wasnt as fun
[4:04:29] ClassicMalcontent: @Val_Kyrie_Pixie couple weeks from now? 2 weeks before 11/23 whatever that is.
[4:04:31] Aro725: Man I thought you were taking a couple days off lol not just one. You deserve a whole week brother
[4:04:32] Sprucemoose: but demon souls looks SO GOOD
[4:04:35] PToastman: Didn’t you ask that already jerexify?
[4:04:37] DispozableHero: Bloodborne 2
[4:04:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: did you see the new trailer for demons souls?
[4:04:39] Ragevamp666: @CaptainJoeyNY its one of the transmorg for the board&sword

[4:05:22] DispozableHero: Its called Rarity @TheBlightedOne

[4:45:01] TroyThe2nd: @SquiddsyTV the problem lies on blanketing all feedback as useless when you have customers to serve, if you want to retain them it's probably a good idea to at least take certain shit in consideration, maybe your vision sucks LMAO
[4:45:01] scarabgamingtv: googled it
[4:45:03] fubarian297: no clue this guy is hilarious though

[4:45:50] TroyThe2nd: by all means you could def just say "yeah fuck it we made what we liked" then cool if nobody else likes it you can hang that on your belt and just not have any money and go under, saying "nothing y'all say is worthwhile" is nonsense lmao
[4:45:57] lel3owski: @MrPoisonGaz good is subjective

[4:56:12] 3dRes: @manhunni mighty league gaming
[4:56:14] Thoreya: @furansowah was so fucking sketchy lmao
[4:56:20] Rakish44: death threats Kappa
[4:56:24] dv_domino: @casualteeee if you mean for the mobs it's plater
[4:56:25] manhunni: 3dRes ah ok
[4:56:27] Trafikk_: exactly... the vast majority is just childish foot stomping and crying
[4:56:28] Utmost777: best way to get change is to find a way to exploit the thing you want changed :P
[4:56:29] daniel85mg: They look at the games from their own perspectivs online, not the whole game
[4:56:32] 91Niki: He's not saying feedback is useless, he's saying people shouldn't act entitled upon devs to ALWAYS take their feedback seriously.
[4:56:34] Colt_Engineer: don't even get me started on the cry babies when Mass Effect: Andromeda came out my god
[4:56:35] TroyThe2nd: idk seems like shadowlands dev cycle would contradict that to some degree what with people suddenly praising blizzard changes that are whollyb ased on feedback
[4:56:36] dragoncook: omg the death threat crap is insane
[4:56:41] JohnsOrb: AND DEATH THREATS
[4:56:42] TroyThe2nd: but a blanket on anything is super stupid
[4:56:44] SpyCrabbo: i feel like any time there's a meme involved it's not useful feedback anymore
[4:56:45] JohnsOrb: ack caps
[4:56:46] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee yeah death threats isn't feedback
[4:56:47] Kisswani: Ardenweald ?
[4:56:47] dapeanutbutter: PoE has been dealing with that a lot in the past year
[4:56:48] JohnsOrb: sorry
[4:56:51] Kisswani: yeah
[4:56:53] Kin_: this was in the Ardenweald short
[4:56:56] beefnstien: i mean didnt wildstar basically tell us to go fuck ourselves when people said the game was to hard lol
[4:56:59] A_l_e_x_S: is this song distorting ???or am i go crazy
[4:57:04] gmisterX: death threats should be pursued legally. Teach those idiots a lesson
[4:57:05] TroyThe2nd: @beefnstien yep
[4:57:09] skymercii: ysera simplCRY
[4:57:10] Utmost777: spoilers Kappa
[4:57:13] Kisswani: Ardenweald probably has my favourite OST
[4:57:16] A_l_e_x_S: <3 <3
[4:57:16] Discard_TV: Cross your fingers you don't get a DMCA for using game music!
[4:57:17] othraerir: spoilers
[4:57:24] Maksa_89: give us free shadowlands
[4:57:25] scarabgamingtv: feedback from serious devoted players can be good but taking feedback from casuals is like letting the blind lead the blind
[4:57:35] fubarian297: honestly though only usefull feed back we can give is to report the bugs and lev devs sort that shit
[4:57:37] 71brewz: but i like my shit distorted
[4:57:38] ActuallyNico: Current "feedback" makes me wish the whole "The customer is always right" thing would die already
[4:57:41] 71brewz: lol
[4:57:47] DecayedmiNt: @discard_tv Most OST's are fine since they're in company.
[4:57:48] chubbersc: I'm trying to choose a main for shadowlands. tank/heals I'm a coin flip on Paladin and monk right now. what do you think
[4:57:51] 91Niki: @beefnstien Yes and they were in their every right to. It's their game. That it failed is another story. His point is, feedback is more than welcome, but people shouldn't act like their opinion SHOULD be heard and listened to by the devs.
[4:57:51] TroyThe2nd: yall gotta think for yourselves lmao that rant was really funny but super dumb, you can definitely think of at least one time someone told your feedback to fuck off and you didn't think it was funny LMAO
[4:57:55] tr4ncetv: If you get upset enough about devs not taking your feedback then go be one yourself. Then understand why people be dumb
[4:57:58] malfalasi98: 100% this kill
[4:57:58] kazatron: Did I miss the accouncement?
[4:58:03] Jomuse92: @ActuallyNico as a retail employee, I endorse this
[4:58:06] hookkz: you can also click on the audio compressor next to volume and turn it off again it fixes sound too
[4:58:11] Thoreya: @troythe2nd we get it u didn’t like the video
[4:58:12] CallMeWallie: Towelliee, can I give you my feedback?
[4:58:14] dkapocalypse: what dev say and what they are really say GO FUCK YOURSELF . LOL
[4:58:16] Discard_TV: @Synthetiktek I know. I was being intentionally hysterical.
[4:58:20] CallMeWallie: As a certified twitch stream viewer
[4:58:21] fubarian297: what are u farming out there on isle
[4:58:32] keeindordel: @Towelliee whats with this dumb ads on twitch.... the ad plays ur stream thne plays.. stutters/buffering i hit pause/play and the same ad comes back on again? D:
[4:58:33] Kisswani: @scarabgamingtv serious devoted players have different priorities . in my opinion , if this game was designed by mythic raiders it would have died a long time ago
[4:58:35] Discard_TV: Because this whole DMCA situation and DMCA in general is insane
[4:58:37] SpyCrabbo: @scarabgamingtv i would plead for the exact opposite, devoted players tend to give the worst feedback for a game's prolonged existence
[4:58:39] TroyThe2nd: @Thoreya no I did I just don't like chat falling in line like it's gospel LMAO
[4:58:41] Stradivarii: I dont think focusing your efforts on the 1% of hardcore players is the right way to go :P
[4:58:46] Brodih_: you used to play alot of Synthave before also
[4:58:51] BuddySinister: Believe Soda got popped from taylor swift ad on spotify LUL

[4:59:00] Shrenko: did you see Cyberpunk tweet? it cracked me up @Towelliee
[4:59:32] nimphtv: i like streambeats
[4:59:34] Discard_TV: Spotify is fine if you're paying for it lol
[4:59:41] 91Niki: Someone got popped for walking past a store on IRL stream with copyrighted music that played for a few seconds.
[4:59:44] BuddySinister: @XshadowturkeyX Yup, problem rights owners and not reading contracts
[4:59:44] Drakenking: We need bezos to hit the RIAA with the wrath of zeus
[4:59:44] Shrenko: https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1322178315403276288
[4:59:45] Tzarvahl: @XshadowturkeyX depending on the contract a band signs with a label, they will never own anything they make under it
[4:59:49] TompsonX: It's just a joke tweet
[4:59:53] Webw0lf359: the whole DMCA thing is fucked, lead guitarist of Dragonforce got banned for performing his own music. Madness

[5:02:05] skymercii: that's like sending death threats to blizzard cus SL got delayed
[5:02:07] Mecabeast: when one encounters that situation curiosity may stop you from turning it off.
[5:02:08] Kisswani: wtf is wrong with people
[5:02:09] Papa_Rowdy: I feel like since people are overhyping the game too much, the devs are pressured to make the game as polished as possible.
[5:02:15] maalow: death threats for a game KEKW
[5:02:18] Stonefather: Why not, I respect them for it danO
[5:02:20] TheCliffyShow: Death threats? "I'm going to kill you because you delayed a video game to make it better and worth my money."
[5:02:20] manhunni: i knew times the com said take your time.... now just shots get fired :D

[5:02:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: just get keanu reeves to tell everyone to calm down it will work
[5:02:53] keeindordel: its as dumb as ppl wanting a refund on thewir pre-order because they delayed the launch of Shadowlands
[5:03:01] keeindordel: their*
[5:03:08] Sonatta: yeap... Keanu should have announced the delay
[5:03:10] brain_wash: death threats are like the new meta, reddit, trade chat, w/e.... death threat fiesta
[5:03:11] Stradivarii: Internet full of Karens these days
[5:03:12] Drakenking: Its the guys job
[5:03:14] Stonefather: If any one is actually upset that it got delayed to the point of anger those people have bigger issues than playing video games.

[5:04:23] notColt45: I feel bad for the people, that their lives hinge on this game to fill some void in their life that they make death threats when it is delayed slightly
[5:04:24] damptowell: @tr4ncetv so you have more of a nougatty center?
[5:04:26] TheCliffyShow: Death threats? "I'm going to kill you because you delayed a video game to make it better and worth my money."
[5:04:27] Ortinoth: there are more ways to express anger in delay
[5:04:28] Tankendat: towHAMUP

[5:04:39] Akoudadis: ITS A GAME THAT THEY DIDNT HAVE AND THEY WONT HAVE FOR A BIT MORE
[5:04:39] Stonefather: Being upset is fine, but being actually angry over it is childish.
[5:04:41] eb29062112: TOP PVP DAMAGE CLASS IN SHADOWLANDS.....GO!
[5:04:43] keeindordel: it should

[5:26:22] dreadpiraterobeebop: @mightbeworth It doesn't work until like level 56, so no, it's no good until SL
[5:26:22] Ortinoth: like a week

[5:26:50] AirmVn: just roll druid :)
[5:26:51] Aro725: the insta mount is so awesome for lvling too
[5:26:55] byrdeen45: they need to make the backpack from mechagon a mount for good
[5:26:56] Mahal_11532: I'd just always use it and that'd be boring
[5:26:57] 91Niki: Overpowered you say? Roll a druid Kappa
[5:27:00] Mitune: @Synthetiktek I dunno the fact they fired over 800 in the past year, shut down a HQ in europe, and they didnt hire for SL dev team this year. Just seems like a weird thing to do for 2020 instead of this year. Its overall good news, but seems late for WoW
[5:27:02] Kromede: i can finally be a druid
[5:27:06] DC_Native: what game was that? with the pixelart
[5:27:07] Clicklesly: I'd actually like a version that works like a normal mount we could use throughout the year ^^

[5:27:15] Doldeldrimar: limit the mount, no pvp use
[5:27:17] Kromede: with the broom stick
[5:27:21] Apheelia: yup druid is instant mount too lol
[5:27:23] TheCliffyShow: We'll, get the perameant broomstick mount right after we get playable High Elves. Meaning, never.
[5:27:29] keeindordel: RUIN THEIR DAY TOWILIEE
[5:27:31] DecayedmiNt: @Mitune Also part of the gaming industry. It's extremely volatile, the turnover rate is one of the highest overall.
[5:27:34] Assimilco: bunch of whordies
[5:27:46] Peterdaroo7: I love the broom

[5:27:48] griffdog125: anyone figure out if you can tame galleon yet

[5:28:22] Rhonabu: @Towelliee if the hunter isnt top aggro then the tame is canceled
[5:28:23] daddy_dolby: @Towelliee They have to keep aggro
[5:28:26] Spathotan: Imagine being a Hunter
[5:28:29] grizzlyhorn: they have to have agro dont they
[5:28:33] Celestia6: they have to have full attention of the animal to tame it
[5:28:34] Kin_: because hunters get aggro on the pet
[5:28:35] Broomba: it breaks the hunter taming
[5:28:36] thedanishvking: F?
[5:28:38] Hawfmaverick: they have to have aggro to tame so taunting it will break the channel

[5:29:14] Drakenking: My local best buy has some
[5:29:16] Apheelia: I never had physical
[5:29:25] Drakenking: @TheCliffyShow you realize blood elves were given high elf eyes right
[5:29:28] MetallicusGaming: TheCliffyShow you alrdy said that
[5:29:29] coldarmorTBG: I think I got the physical all the way to legion
[5:29:31] ZyntosAran: @Koperniiik there is no physical version of shadowlands other then the Collectors edition
[5:29:31] Drakenking: so, you know, they're kinda playable right now
[5:29:33] TrieCC: My pc doesnt have a cd-rom any way lol
[5:29:38] coldarmorTBG: but Ilike to have the boxes lol

[5:30:18] darkwaves: ripping blurays is about it
[5:30:20] starknadooo: they use usb sticks
[5:30:22] Chillin_Chance: Diggin the vibes here
[5:30:23] DecayedmiNt: @Mitune People freaked the fuck out when Blizzard got rid of the HQ in Europe. But when Riot did the same thing to their Sydney office this month? No one batted an eye.
[5:30:23] griffdog125: yea got windows on a usb
[5:30:24] Backaddict: tray is for drink holder
[5:30:26] xdunpealx: You could still potentially use it to watch movies if you didnt rip 4k movies
[5:30:28] DeadlyDag: There's no disks in the physical editions either though? Not in the CEs at least.
[5:30:40] VarkanosGaming: window come on usb key now
[5:30:45] Needdaann: you can fit a restore on a usb now, so cd-rom isn't even needed anymore
[5:30:46] JaseLeland: my case doesn't even have a drive slot
[5:30:51] Yohaneson: I think windows might come on a USB stick.. not sure
[5:30:52] Mitune: @Synthetiktek Riot and Blizz do not equate in this scenario.

[5:31:22] dreadpiraterobeebop: A GALLON OF WHITE LIGHTNIN
[5:31:30] FistoTheFistybot: have you ever tried mixing coffee with coca cola? Towelliee
[5:31:34] Apheelia: announce what?
[5:31:37] TheCliffyShow: I bought vanilla WoW physical. All the expansions have been digital or Collector's Editions.
[5:31:39] Drakenking: @FistoTheFistybot get out
[5:31:40] xMuxx: anounce what?
[5:31:47] billybaroo1: do u like edibles while drinking bourbon?
[5:31:47] xdunpealx: What is the best way to level now anyways? Tank dungeon grind or is questing?
[5:31:55] antphilosophy: a gallon of water weighs 8lbs probably weighs more than you think
[5:31:57] dreadpiraterobeebop: That sounds gross
[5:31:59] Noshpan: I have rookie numbers. I have 10 level 50s
[5:32:00] Apheelia: sorry to ask I just got here :)
[5:32:01] MexicanMisker: do you really need that many characters? are they just for mount farming?
[5:32:02] darkdestroz: @Towelliee And how many BC dungeons have u done now,
[5:32:09] eyemyor: Coffee and coke is actually good
[5:32:15] keeindordel: grats on the gloves towilee
[5:32:16] Thewunk: Thewunk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Woot!
[5:32:17] IronButlerZ: are most of them paladins or ?
[5:32:21] eyemyor: They sell Coffee Coke in a can in Thailand
[5:32:22] Mekillers1: @Towelliee I miss you man
[5:32:25] wetttnine: Coffee and coke fires you up, prison pre workout
[5:32:30] Mcaffee: okay i just got a commercial break, i though you only ran those before and after the stream
[5:32:36] xdunpealx: _Towelliee_ ever watch TheTipsyBartender on youtube?
[5:32:43] krittacle: @Towelliee Try peach crown with unsweet tea.
[5:32:48] DecayedmiNt: @Mitune My point it is isn't just Blizzard being "greedy" or some shit. Riot, Blizzard, EA. Lots are shutting down Headquarters. Especially after Covid taught companies that some jobs can work from home.
[5:32:48] Mitune: @Synthetiktek It has been clear since blizz let off those huge numbers of employees the game has suffered noticeably. SL still feels very unpolished from my experience in the beta. You would think if they were planning to hire 2,000 people they would have hired more for an expansion release of a game they say they are going to focus on

[5:35:26] ZenDaemon: Could be for Diablo?
[5:35:26] Drakenking: They also then hired devs LULW
[5:35:29] Broomba: bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir
[5:35:32] Satanica: hello
[5:35:34] Backaddict: @Givin Terran guild?
[5:35:40] Shrenko: did you watch the new madseason video?
[5:35:42] Drakenking: They literally increased Dev staff by 20% right after they laid off customer support from elsewhere
[5:35:44] barry_ow2: how are warriors looking in shadowlands?
[5:35:46] Bulgogiprince: Hell Bobby Kotick was on Squawk Box this morning saying they need people
[5:35:52] Snackyy23: what they're saying is blizz let go of 800 earlier this year, they're closing the France office, and now came out and said they're hiring 2000 people.
[5:35:54] TrieCC: Blizzard is bigger than ust wow
[5:36:00] GamerKillance: According to retailers the Xbox Series X/S are in much higher demand than the PS5. That game pass has to be carrying the console. That or the fact of backwards Compatibility is a thing for xbox while they canned is for ps5
[5:36:02] chopsaki: well... it didn't help...
[5:36:05] Drakenking: @Snackyy23 which is wrong and a lie already LULW
[5:36:07] Mitune: I wasnt equating all 800 to just the Wow team @Towelliee
[5:36:09] Cyntech89: hiring 2000 people (at lower salaries)
[5:36:10] Doobieman214: Bellular is an idiot sometimes imo
[5:36:10] DecayedmiNt: @Mitune Which they cycle through constantly. They hire when they need people, fire when they don't. Welcome to the gaming industry.
[5:36:10] jackson_tc: blizzard does more than just wow? 🤔
[5:36:15] SicariusGTV: Im really fed up with bellular videos, they are always 20-30 min and most of them are repeate of other videos from him
[5:36:16] Drakenking: They didnt fire 800 people, that number was eventually settled on a little over 200
[5:36:19] jackson_tc: i dont believe it until i read it on reddit
[5:36:24] Givin: I can't make a new character and go 10 mins without getting a spam invite on that server frm there
[5:36:24] Drakenking: Do your fucking research
[5:36:28] swordart_19: WoW 1 Billion yearly Franchise POGGERS
[5:36:29] r0b928: Did you hear about watching gaming?
[5:36:32] IronButlerZ: @Towelliee you think natanos death will be brutal?
[5:36:39] Broomba: so many "experts" on what happened in France and in Blizzard HQ!!!! LOL
[5:36:47] Snackyy23: @Drakenking oh i know. im just mentioning what people have been complaining about
[5:36:48] falldrgn: World of Onycraft 2021..

[5:36:55] aUnkSoldier: Blaming QA is the worst thing to say about a game to launch. It's not their fault.
[5:36:58] MetallicusGaming: IronButlerZ brutal? what you think this is Game of Thrones? LUL
[5:37:02] TheCliffyShow: Bobby Kotick's ball washer.
[5:37:20] darkwaves: But someone on the internet told me it was true!
[5:37:22] Collected1: yeah but that doesnt get clicks
[5:37:24] falldrgn: ive done QA work.. We get shit on so much. Cause we point out shits thats broken
[5:37:27] jackson_tc: isnt every employee in a software company a dev? 🤔
[5:37:27] Drakenking: Hey man if Bobby koticks ball washer paid enough on a 6 month contract you can bet half of asmons stream would be right there volunteering
[5:37:28] MrGattz: i think they should just lay off the pvp devs. its not like the game needs them anyway Kappa
[5:37:30] TrieCC: So many experts on the internet bc they saw a yt video
[5:37:32] thiccsushi: @Towelliee People just like grasping at any straws they can to justify their views
[5:37:41] jackson_tc: FeelsBadMan
[5:37:43] Kromede: towelstradamus POGGERS
[5:37:43] Screamnsteam: They laid off the chef Jebaited
[5:37:43] willy_billy_silly: Disney world layed off all of their entertainment staff
[5:37:45] chopsaki: keep hearing about all these ex bliz devs starting companies.. so there do seems to be devs leaving
[5:37:45] kinghamlin: Covid has created millions
[5:37:47] Vch001: As long as they didn't lay off the Coffee and Donuts guy
[5:37:48] crawcook: I would be more worried about all those new game companies popping out and taking employuees from blizzard.
[5:37:48] A_Klimas: having worked for them, i dislike any layoffs when the company boasted record highs
[5:37:49] Alaquane: @MrGattz true
[5:37:53] pinjones: bald KEKW
[5:37:57] aUnkSoldier: @falldrgn I use to be a QA too and I totally understand your point
[5:37:59] pinjones: I like his name
[5:37:59] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter! https://twitter.com/towelthetank and on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/user/Consolecrusader towHAMUP
[5:38:01] DecayedmiNt: Hell, try having a conversation with someone in the field that does contract work. They can sometimes work for different companies every week.
[5:38:02] MrGattz: @kinghamlin your delusional
[5:38:03] Antdavs24: lol people have 0 business knowledge talking about business KEKW
[5:38:14] EndgameInc: layoffs are a garbage way for public companies to manage stakeholder expectations... that said, Blizz is almost certainly laying off only non-critical roles... not devs
[5:38:18] MetallicusGaming: People need to read the WHOLE article and not just the title also
[5:38:29] nihilistic_bat: @Jackson_TC I work for a software company and I do not develop the software.
[5:38:33] Motivess: @mrgattz no, he's not
[5:38:37] kinghamlin: @MrGattz my company just terminated over 50 positions due to the Covid impact. Who is delusional here?
[5:38:38] Mecabeast: but their feedback is unique and valuable
[5:38:41] Drakenking: 40kish people
[5:38:44] peatear69: People also forget, Blizzard/Activision owns CandyCrush which is also one of their main profitable products lol
[5:38:46] jackson_tc: @cubertin it was just a joke
[5:38:50] falldrgn: those Mixer layoffs...
[5:38:59] MrGattz: @kinghamlin thats exactly what im saying lol
[5:39:00] nihilistic_bat: @Jackson_TC :D okay
[5:39:01] Mcaffee: Mcaffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! subbed againn
[5:39:02] billybaroo1: make everyone work 80hrs/wk doing the work of 2/3 people.
[5:39:02] Moobot: @MCAFFEE with the 29 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[5:39:02] TrieCC: And Disney is a pretty shady company
[5:39:03] jackson_tc: LUL
[5:39:07] Ortinoth: @kinghamlin about 3 month ago i had to release 120 employees due to covid
[5:39:08] DeadlyDag: @Mitune according to the actual news, it was 400, and all customer service. just saying.
[5:39:08] Drakenking: Im pretty sure disney has enough money where they could pay their employees for 50 years without making a cent
[5:39:26] RandomHeroDK: HeyGuys
[5:39:33] ZenDaemon: ZenDaemon subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:39:35] sir_vanillin: sad Mikey towFeelsbad
[5:39:42] aUnkSoldier: Things you must understand in this is two things: the departments don't talk to each other. When they do, they don't understand each other because they have a tunneled vision.
[5:39:42] crawcook: @Drakenking true, but unfornatunately that is not how for profit business work.
[5:39:44] Moobot: towBleedpurple towHAMUP Welcome to the Hammer Squad ZENDAEMON! towBleedpurple towHAMUP towBleedpurple towHAMUP
[5:39:44] falldrgn: most of the people that got laid off at disney were seasonal workers and operations staff.
[5:39:49] MrGattz: i guess its a perspective question. covid has creative millions of jobs. yes. it is also cost people hundreds of millions of jobs. depends on your perspective
[5:40:03] DecayedmiNt: Covid is teaching the tech industry that they can afford to have people work from home instead of going to an office. A lot of companies are likely going to move QA/CM to home and shut down offices
[5:40:06] Coriollis: we talking about the lay offs from France?
[5:40:07] billybaroo1: the lag rolls are brutal
[5:40:11] Theduskflyer: Chevron, Shell, Exxon, Concho, Apache all had 20-30% layoffs this year alone
[5:40:12] Sonatta: @Drakenking didn't stop them from laying off 28,000 Disneyland park employees at the end of September
[5:40:45] TrieCC: That's a transition tho
[5:40:46] aUnkSoldier: stop it: QA IS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
[5:40:54] falldrgn: @Sonatta But they can afford that.. Most of those people were operations\part time\seasonal stuff.
[5:40:57] crawcook: I hope not, as a developer I miss the conversation with peers, where we solve problems together.
[5:41:02] aUnkSoldier: QA NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING.
[5:41:05] stone_age: rail industry has had massive layofffs and furloughs as well
[5:41:08] DecayedmiNt: @aUnkSoldier Never said it wasn't. But they can work from home.
[5:41:09] Backaddict: QA for most places is when they do it live and then try and fix it
[5:41:22] crawcook: Yes, people undervalue the interaction.
[5:41:28] MetallicusGaming: You try to code when you have kids running around, a dog barking and a wife blaming you for not putting the trash outside LUL Kappa
[5:41:33] flyingmachin3: it wont be a cost save eventually, theyll have to pay for their internet and electric cost for each employee
[5:41:42] Impendngdoom: opinionated non devs be opinionated
[5:41:45] Backaddict: Source: I spend tons of time each week cleaning up broken changes that went through CAB approval
[5:41:47] TunaBass11: @Towelliee i've worked from home for 8 months... its extremely isolating
[5:41:48] Impendngdoom: we all work online
[5:41:54] Cyntech89: The Heroes of the Storm hut
[5:41:55] shinta__: as much as commute sucks, people interactions is much easier when you are in a room than when you are working from home
[5:41:59] anekdotin: I work at Intel work from home and I get more done. No distractions from coworkers
[5:41:59] Impendngdoom: most prior to covid worked from home anyway
[5:42:04] donakke: As a developer working remotely, I completely disagree. We have so many tools to work together still. I have been way more productive working from home.
[5:42:08] R2RHIN0: Do you know if during non-covid times they do Tours of the headquaters?
[5:42:16] Aumora: @Cyntech89 </3
[5:42:22] 91Niki: This is why i'm single and have no kids Kappa
[5:42:22] sarcilav: 100% true
[5:42:24] manhunni: i wouldnt say undervalue, some learn that its possible to stay home and work from there and some companys cant, like blizz or lets say its better to stay in a room together
[5:42:25] EndgameInc: <infosec and working remotely, hopefully forever, definitely a different animal for devs
[5:42:25] Thoreya: im not a dev so im not gonna act like i know how they are at home
[5:42:26] Soragoo: DIsneyland is still closed and about 90% of workers there were part time. No reason for them to keep them on benefits payroll. Disney World has 75k employees alone in Florida. They are still only operating at roughly 25% capacity. They, unfortunately, had to lay off enough people since not all offerings are currently available. So they released all Seasonal and Part-Time employees. Mostly in the entertainment department.
[5:42:29] donakke: We have zoom, slack, and our editor has pair programming features built into it.
[5:42:31] A_Klimas: and i dont have to wear pants anymore
[5:42:32] KonradGM: i worked from home since beggining of the year, you can get used to it too, depends a lot on a person
[5:42:33] Backaddict: Webex roullete with the kids screaming in the back during a call
[5:42:36] th30dor: at my workplace, people take turns in going to work and working from home. Keeps people sane @Towelliee
[5:42:39] keeindordel: head to your local library @Towelliee :D
[5:42:40] darklordz1979: @91Niki lol smart
[5:42:41] turfjitsu: sounds like you towelliee lol working from home with yourr significant other dog horns lol xD
[5:42:44] darkwaves: it depends on what kind of project you are working for, certain types of software is easier to remote develop then others
[5:42:52] keeindordel: peace and quiet at th elibrary and human interaction
[5:42:53] xMuxx: I got to fly my $10k drone outside of Blizz HQ a couple weeks ago
[5:42:54] chopsaki: having people interrupt dev work every 15min.. is one of the worst things ever.. that and open offices..
[5:42:55] KylarDM: Beta/PTR will always find more bugs than any QA department ever could
[5:42:58] turfjitsu: NO PANTS!
[5:42:58] dimofodi: I threw out all my underpants!
[5:43:01] NextLifeAfter: Has itrs own cafeteria LUL isolated af
[5:43:01] thiccsushi: It feels good to work in the jammies lol
[5:43:02] MrGattz: @donakke i think it depends on who you are, where you live, how you live and whats around you. for some i bet its millions of times better. for others living in apartments in a city with kids and animals and everything i bet its not as easy
[5:43:08] fewyn: we are supposed to wear pants?
[5:43:11] Mitune: @Synthetiktek But they did gut the QA team a while back for WoW, although my original point I wanted to make was that I just wish if they were planning to hire more people for focusing on thier main ip that they would do so sooner for SL. It just seems unpolished. I know the gaming industry is volatile but it still seems like mismanaging or a massive restructuring of the company that is hurting the games quality
[5:43:16] EndgameInc: although dev collaboration tools are top tier at this point and make it so easy for them to be remote
[5:43:17] DeadlyDag: I've seen too many meetings where people have forgotten to turn off their camera and started jacking off though. LUL
[5:43:19] turfjitsu: i know :)
[5:43:22] TrieCC: They will get used to it, just like everyone else
[5:43:24] Shrenko: all I talk to loves working from home
[5:43:31] MrGattz: @dimofodi the hero we deserve Kappa
[5:43:33] EndgameInc: obviously doesn't work if their home environment isnt ideal
[5:43:39] Ahlmo: Towelliee does not wear pants at work either KappaClaus
[5:43:39] Coriollis: thank god for cloud
[5:43:41] Snackyy23: @donakke very true. I live by myself in a 1 bedroom apt. This is much more convenient than traveling 2 hours to get to work.
[5:43:43] Khalio23: Khalio23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! You say that this announcement on sunday will do so you can relax and play other games. But do you think you will? considering you've been so used to the way you stream for so many years?
[5:43:43] Moobot: @KHALIO23 with the 19 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[5:44:00] Ghettoskippy: I feel like, gaming companies should leave California. They can stay in the general area but Cali is ALWAYS on fire.
[5:44:01] torandre89: can't have home office when you work in an electronic store :D
[5:44:08] EndgameInc: them not having a continuity plan for fires seems like a huge misstep at this point though, they should have a contingency for that shit by now
[5:44:10] MrGattz: @Coriollis until we get what happened several times this year which was cloud flare services were down for hours
[5:44:15] brand0nhxc: so is nov 23rd the confirmed date? or do you think they will push it back again?
[5:44:16] aUnkSoldier: @Towelliee they'll adapt to this situation. I work in a consulting firm and I work from home since March. We try stuff to break the isolation.
[5:44:20] TheRealAxiom: Sucks D2 comes out Nov 10th also
[5:44:22] Broomba: wtf?
[5:44:27] just_laxus: i am so hyped for shadowlands release but i also can't wait for 2020 to be over
[5:44:33] Coriollis: @MrGattz :( nothing is perfect
[5:44:34] TrieCC: Was there a question in there?
[5:44:39] eyemyor: A salary from Twitch goes a long way in letting him do what he wants
[5:44:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[5:44:54] Broomba: i love how people read into things that arent there! @towelliee
[5:44:57] callmestray: SHATTERED DREAMS
[5:45:00] bhadgaming: lol
[5:45:02] Mitune: is this mount also a 1 in 2k drop chance @Towelliee
[5:45:10] Khalio23: Sorry, my grammar can be shit sometimes
[5:45:14] BJofBorg: towOny
[5:45:14] Crowzcut: he said you going stop playing wow all the time
[5:45:17] kappaday23: Kappa
[5:45:19] crawcook: @EndgameInc yes, that's true, butat the same time nothing can replace random brainstorming with your coworkers, tools are enough when you already know how to solve a problem, but when you are stuck on something that fast exchance of ideas is priceless in my opinion.
[5:45:21] MrGattz: @Towelliee when should i announce on discord that your going to start playing hello kitty island adventure full time?
[5:45:24] heatheraustin: At my office we are two week cycles with A and B groups. To keep use distanced but also it gives us a since of normal life.
[5:45:29] callmestray: Belt of shattered towelliee
[5:45:31] darkspyrokarma: Do you have any mop world boss mounts besides sha?
[5:45:35] 91Niki: @MrGattz KEKW
[5:45:37] Horuseternal69: @MrGattz as fast a damn possible Gattz xD
[5:45:41] BullTerrorist: how lon have we had the shadowlands map?
[5:45:53] wendigo721: @Towelliee good morning hows your day going
[5:45:54] DecayedmiNt: @Mitune I mean, when the WoW team is apparently the largest it's ever been even after "layoffs". I wouldn't use that as an excuse for Shadowlands being buggy and not ready. There's a lot that contribute to that. Covid, devs having to work from home, when they're used to office work. Ect
[5:45:55] stickylicious21: @Towelliee hey whats tht huge totem pole on your back called? i need it for my tauren PogChamp
[5:45:57] magnumcuda: you didnt open the pile
[5:46:08] Crowzcut: some viewers will miss you
[5:46:08] eyemyor: Time to do some IRL, lol
[5:46:09] Broomba: inc OSRS
[5:46:10] SeckSymbols: Wait, did you already announce?
[5:46:14] Horuseternal69: @stickylicious21 it's the heritage armor for highmountain tauren mate
[5:46:20] Vivelli: @Towelliee any other games you are itchin to play after SL progression?
[5:46:25] eyemyor: Do an IRL stream of you making a big buy at the liquor store
[5:46:28] EndgameInc: @crawcook yeah definitely don't disagree, it's just not as bad as some folks think, it will just take time to adjust and learn to work in the current environment for sure
[5:46:36] Meenyx: It would also save space if the companies moved into an all work from home system, I wonder if the devs would be able to take that dedicated work space off on their taxes this next tax season
[5:46:39] stickylicious21: @Horuseternal69 thats weird, mine are two smaller ones instead of 1 big one
[5:46:39] jkitchin75: how do you make the rarity bigger?
[5:46:40] DeanoTV: osrs worse than classic LUL
[5:46:41] SeckSymbols: Any and all PS5 games
[5:46:43] crawcook: I think SL is buggy mostly because of COVID and tha6t they made it so complicated with different systems.
[5:46:48] jontrann: likes destiny 2, calls osrs shit, LUL
[5:46:49] kacchan_bo: @Horuseternal69 its the tauren one not high mountain
[5:46:49] TheRealAxiom: D2 comes out Nov 10th
[5:46:51] Bh1nonly: @Towelliee Whats wrong with OSRS? :O
[5:46:56] 91Niki: The new spiderman game Kreygasm
[5:46:59] Ballswagger: do you watch mandalorian
[5:47:01] Horuseternal69: @kacchan_bo yeah meant that hightmt is the smaller ones :P
[5:47:02] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee get back to those jrpgs
[5:47:09] elektrik_kiwi: what aboust ashes of creation?
[5:47:09] nativeW01f: D2 raid??
[5:47:11] TrieCC: so me :D
[5:47:15] Backaddict: Bloons Tower Defense 6. Would love to see you play that one!
[5:47:19] duffluv22: Myles Morales
[5:47:19] Broomba: you play what you want to play @towelliee your loyal fans and subs will be there!
[5:47:27] othraerir: raid logging? eep
[5:47:32] hoyhoy007: did you finish ff14 shadowbringers yet? it is really good
[5:47:32] Aervyper: @Towelliee is that a good thing thought?
[5:47:35] SeckSymbols: I am so happy the Into the Spiderverse suit is in Miles Morales
[5:47:36] Desanduin: I only have an hour or two to play every day so it's hard to get on a roll with content :(
[5:47:46] Maligus: wait what is happening my stuff lagged out
[5:47:48] biscuitness: Anything specific to PS5 you're interested in? (You're getting a PS5, right?)

[5:47:52] ryptrs: sounds amazing honestly
[5:47:54] TheCliffyShow: Every variety stream Towelliee does will have this question 100 times, "Did you quit WoW?"
[5:47:56] 91Niki: @Towelliee You gonna try and get some ps5 game hours in before SL release or nah?
[5:47:58] drengenn: Can you show your map so i can find the dino u keep killing
[5:48:04] L0wLifeLuke: Spamming M+ is even less worth it right, the end of dungeon loot chance and ilvl is lower?
[5:48:05] SteelEm: Gooodddd
[5:48:09] TrieCC: makes it so more ppl stay longer in the game
[5:48:13] keeindordel: Main alts :peepohappy:
[5:48:13] floorinspect: is there an actual cap? or can you be a no lifer and farm things that people dont usually do? Or is it like Cata, where there was a 5k cap on both @Towelliee
[5:48:24] MrGattz: hey there is nothing wrong with islands!
[5:48:27] smashwow: @L0wLifeLuke it's less than heroic gear.
[5:48:28] MrGattz: at all
[5:48:30] MrGattz: ever
[5:48:32] kacchan_bo: @drengenn island above kun'lai summit
[5:48:37] DecayedmiNt: @nenorocitule69 Caps like Valor, ect.
[5:48:41] biscuitness: You gonna play Valhalla?
[5:48:42] junkrat_sky: towHAMUP enigmaHeart
[5:48:49] Coriollis: Odyssey was ok :)
[5:48:50] Backaddict: @MrGattz ok bro, settle down
[5:48:51] Drakenking: then you have mount farming alts
[5:49:00] fewyn: oondasta spawns 15 minutes exactly after last kill
[5:49:01] messinna: more time for PS5 games then.....
[5:49:01] MrGattz: @backaddict EvEr
[5:49:02] chojoe25: !settings
[5:49:06] fewyn: so it's usually pretty accurate
[5:49:10] SeckSymbols: I just picked up my extra PS5 controller and this thing has some weight to it
[5:49:12] Backaddict: @MrGattz lol
[5:49:16] hoyhoy007: ffvii remake on ps4 is amazing

[5:53:45] Drakenking: Its so ridiculous that you can get DMCA'd off music licensed for a game

[5:54:19] gruntpunch: duuuuude
[5:54:20] erawtic: WOW
[5:54:21] GamerKillance: @TheScubaSteve693 Aside from the fact retailers are claiming there are more preorders demands for xbox than PS? Would love to prove it, but they won't let me link anything here
[5:54:21] Drakenking: @TrieCC Yes it absolutely is, someone got DMCA'd for walking past a fucking store that has music playing
[5:54:21] theSalute: gon be crazy

[5:54:52] TrieCC: @Drakenking Thats the implimentation, not the reason
[5:54:58] SeckSymbols: @GamerKillance It has been shown time and time again that the playstation has had more preorder interest than Xbox.
[5:54:58] biscuitness: Only a couple months?
[5:55:06] Drakenking: lmao
[5:55:07] biscuitness: I love the FC series.
[5:55:09] TrieCC: @Drakenking The implimentation sucks, i agree
[5:55:17] biscuitness: Original was Feb 18 for FC6
[5:55:25] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 960 units were placed on the battlefield.
[5:55:26] KingGoris: bro that lego set is $800? wtf

[5:55:46] EndgameInc: @KingGoris it's like the biggest lego set (or was) when it released
[5:55:48] Exodeo_: Battle ready
[5:55:49] snublefant: @Towelliee how many attempts did you have on Midnight before you got it?
[5:55:50] biscuitness: The games aren't perfect, but FC has excellent gunplay, fun open worlds to tear up.
[5:55:51] Drakenking: It's still fucking ridiculous, music being played in the background regardless of if its in a clip or not, would never be the primary reason someone views a clip
[5:56:02] GamerKillance: @TheScubaSteve693 Sorry, but I just linked the proof. You're more than welcome to debate it. Xbox Series X/S is currently in higher demand
[5:56:10] biscuitness: OOOOO What about Black Ops Cold War? That's one I'm super excited for.
[5:56:16] Luthercorpz: Where's Hunter
[5:56:20] Luthercorpz: trkCreep
[5:56:30] roflpotamus: why wouldnt it lol
[5:56:31] Drakenking: There has to be some logical end to the applications of your legal reach
[5:56:42] TrieCC: @Drakenking Which is why the implimentatin is stupid, but that will change after a while, when they get time to refine it
[5:56:43] h3anniversary: Hey

[5:57:21] GamerKillance: @TheScubaSteve693 Shows xbox is in higher demand in many more country. You must not know how to read
[5:57:24] EndgameInc: @KingGoris yeah man, the "UCS" (ultimate collector series) sets are insane. I bought one at release for 750 and got offered 1500 the following week to buy it, lol

[5:57:40] TrieCC: Yeah the system is super flawed, way to sensietive
[5:57:42] Drakenking: @TrieCC theyve had a decade or longer to refine it they just dont give a fuck and have no legal reason to even respond to DMCA counter claims

[6:22:25] m3rk_zion: @MrGattz Make it cheaper, more people will purchase the boosts.
[6:22:25] ebone45: do the Hierloom set bonuses make a huge difference?
[6:22:28] godcomplex33: @Towelliee Is it even worth it to snag garrisons and class mounts on characters knowing they might make it shorter later on? Or could that not be a thing ever

[6:23:10] turfjitsu: i can go there and poop on that dk for you
[6:23:16] MrGattz: @Norezion your not wrong, but then what happens when most people just boost? they dont play as much to level which means they dont need to have a game sub for longer.
[6:23:22] Coriollis: most excited was for Legion since order hall and hidden appearences I quite enjoyed it

[6:24:40] m3rk_zion: @MrGattz There will always be core players who will legacy level that's a given because of what WoW is. if anything more people who purchase a boost and move on will still in the long run make them more money.

[6:25:29] Mr_Erwt: Its 20 because you unlock your first pvp talent slot then
[6:25:59] MrGattz: @Norezion eh idk. maybe. but then again im not blizzard, i dont have access to all those data points and stats as much as i would love to. so maybe they know something that we dont. who knows
[6:26:01] CertifiableAndy: I've learned hillsbrad and silverpine are pretty fun/easy for horde.
[6:26:03] Rane_Tehp: New cinematic????

[6:26:27] toobaked1987: @Towelliee can you go and get lula? I need to prep a roast and I have no clue how to do so.
[6:26:30] nuroo: are dungeon's a good way to level?
[6:26:35] Divine_Miscreant: I'm checking my server with WM..it's pretty low pop for horde..flying out there now in case you miss it
[6:26:35] godcomplex33: Professions are getting remastered though @Towelliee so that could maybe make garrisons worth it? idk
[6:26:40] MILESkg21: POGGERS
[6:26:42] swordart_19: THERE IS new PREVIEW OF BASTION

[6:29:22] keeindordel: ROAR
[6:29:25] ashwing_: Okay I guess?
[6:29:27] EternalGloryx: I hate this time of year because it makes me want to play WoW again, but I can't as it's too addicting.
[6:29:27] Vivelli: that was a very empty roar
[6:29:43] MeekPR4L: @EternalGloryx but do you still play other games?
[6:29:44] EternalGloryx: So now I just enjoy it by watching streams lol
[6:29:44] Dyriks: ...roar
[6:29:46] dusk90: cow

[6:30:10] LegoCoin: CHEWY roar
[6:30:10] biscuitness: or longer....
[6:30:19] Tyrrak: Sounded like someone constepated
[6:30:23] MeekPR4L: @EternalGloryx I never understood that though, if your still playing video games in your free time why not still play?
[6:30:23] topdiesel2018: A demon as alied races

[6:31:08] keeindordel: calling it now, next expansion will be a Voidlords/Au army of the light expac
[6:31:12] EternalGloryx: @MeekPR4L because it's not as time consuming at all. I can jump in and out of COD and have a good time. WoW is a grind. Playing it casually is not for me. I used to be a Heroic raider and it was fun, but as life goes on I can't dedicate the time now.
[6:31:24] Livermunch16: @Towelliee What's the best way to farm the coins?
[6:31:34] jmadoree: frogs

[6:31:57] KingGoris: that transmog was in gw2 back in 2012 lol

[6:32:03] BuddySinister: D:
[6:32:04] mrpresbaby: Naxx 12/3
[6:32:08] maardal: I actually don't hate the transmog. Don't like that it's behind a paywall though.
[6:32:12] EternalGloryx: @callmestray it's not the same, everyone can play differently, I have a addicting personality for WoW, doesn't work for me.
[6:32:12] nytebayne: magical milk!
[6:32:17] m3rk_zion: Morning @RhadigarTV I hope you are well friend.
[6:32:26] denflup: !sha
[6:32:26] kllzez: PogChamp
[6:32:27] Ortinoth: Dec 3rd for Naxx classic

[6:32:42] Xailen: NAXX OUT PogChamp
[6:32:42] itsjustcarr: @Towelliee stream raiders battle is rdy

[6:32:50] mikejames01: classic LuL
[6:32:55] stallowned: naxx out POGGERS
[6:32:58] lel3owski: imagine raiding naxx during a fresh retail
[6:33:01] SeckSymbols: I dont want a rerelease of Nyalotha WutFace
[6:33:07] Vivelli: nathria*
[6:33:08] MILESkg21: DOUBLE DIP LUL
[6:33:09] Novirtue_: So Naxx cleared in 3 hours, then castle nathria, makes sense :P
[6:33:10] denflup: n'yalotha? Pog
[6:33:12] Ex__Drip: Assic wow
[6:33:21] Malindan: Nyalotha?
[6:33:25] SeckSymbols: Classic is boring anyways
[6:33:25] callmestray: @EternalGloryx cod casually for me isnt fun. i get addicted to it. just pointing out the fact that everyone is different and making a blanket statement about wow not being casual is just wrong
[6:33:34] Ortinoth: Naxx maybe 3 hours at the longest
[6:33:37] Malindan: Were still stuck in bfa then LUL
[6:33:37] Coriollis: what is that faerie dk WutFace
[6:33:51] EternalGloryx: @callmestray i'm not making a blanket statement, I literally said I can't play it casually.
[6:33:54] xmedpakx: 3hours of getting buffed and 45min raid
[6:33:55] dragothicx: Naxx Out PogChamp
[6:34:01] EternalGloryx: @callmestray So you're picking a fight when we are literally on the same page.
[6:34:02] maardal: Thanks
[6:34:03] Ortinoth: this is the new Nightfae DK
[6:34:26] MILESkg21: great idea Kappa
[6:34:33] EternalGloryx: @callmestray I'm literally saying I miss WoW but that I, ME, cannot play it casually and enjoy it. I'm sure other's can.
[6:34:37] swordart_19: WHO CARES
[6:34:38] MeekPR4L: @EternalGloryx Yeah i kinda get it
[6:34:41] Riddlz: they have to give the classic group something to do cause they dont want to play retail
[6:34:44] dreioo: a lot of Classic players don't care about Shadowlands
[6:34:46] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee would you want to see the option to scale old raids? (but no loot)
[6:34:48] dragothicx: Not conflicting player bases sure, Kappa
[6:34:51] Spritenger: Maybe their numbers show that classic players aren't rreally playing live.
[6:34:51] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[6:34:54] swordart_19: Classic Andy will play NAXX simple as that
[6:34:55] Spaede: maybe Blizz wants players to make a "meaningful" choice, between classic and retail
[6:34:58] griffdog125: lol check out lux with the wig on
[6:35:03] Novirtue_: Called my boss yesterday on his home phone, first thing he said: "Requesting time off for shadowlands? Sure"
[6:35:03] Takobaited: they're going for nostalgia numbers too
[6:35:08] MeekPR4L: @EternalGloryx dont listen to them LUL trying to force feed you
[6:35:09] MILESkg21: all of the NEVER RETAIL Andys LUL
[6:35:13] Mallaes: 🥔
[6:35:14] Riddlz: they are telling fibs
[6:35:15] a_demeaning_cow: Naxx was probably always scheduled for the 3rd but the delay makes it weird to try and work around.
[6:35:16] SeckSymbols: Thats because classic was a mistake of time and money on Blizzards part trying to cater to the classic andys KEKW
[6:35:21] Daveybutter: @towelliee its my last day at my job after 6 years. Better one incoming 🙏
[6:35:27] EternalGloryx: @callmestray @MeekPR4L I mean at one point I was paying monthly and literally flying around mining and just using auction house. I was like, why..... lol

[6:36:05] dreioo: @TheScubaSteve693 Classic made so much money and people still play it after over an year. It was a very smart move on their part.
[6:36:07] crawcook: @TheScubaSteve693 What? Classic literally doubled their sub numbers. They admitted it as a financial success.
[6:36:07] thickthighs91: true
[6:36:12] classictwo: They laid off 1000 people this week at my job it was no joke like cut day on hard knocks
[6:36:15] aleck1776: Its all about just experiencing what i didnt back in the day for me. when it comes to Classic

[6:36:35] EternalGloryx: But thanks to COVID I have tons of free time again so it's making me want to play again XD haha
[6:36:40] Daveybutter: @towelliee the next expansion will be Classic vs Retail since we'll all be 60.
[6:36:41] papaPathos: most classic players for sure have no idea about naxx and will be at it for a while.
[6:36:46] SeckSymbols: It took money away from Retail where that money could have been more beneficial, as we are seeing with how bad BFA was and how Shadowlands launch is currently looking
[6:36:55] Collected1: daym. ManVsGame scored Joe Biden sponsorship
[6:36:57] invis1988: most guilds will take a month to clear naxx lul
[6:37:02] SilverSnowRoze: I'm new to your stream as an actual chat participant.
[6:37:10] invis1988: top 10% will do it in a week, 1% in under an hr
[6:37:11] messinna: is anyoane know if luck of Sl in Eu will be at midnight or ealier in the morning ?
[6:37:25] messinna: lunch
[6:37:27] ashwing_: a month LUL
[6:37:36] MILESkg21: a month OMEGALUL

[6:37:58] Madnezz123: naxx is out
[6:38:01] gran_dius: easy*
[6:38:02] griffdog125: lol lux is going alittle crazy on his stream
[6:38:12] Novirtue_: 1 day after nax: "5 man group clears Naxx using exploit"
[6:38:12] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter! https://twitter.com/towelthetank and on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/user/Consolecrusader towHAMUP
[6:38:16] Collected1: classic was everything i expected it to be. around 24 hours of itch scratching and then I was done.
[6:38:30] SeckSymbols: @Collected1 I'm happy for him, he has been trying to get people to pay attention to our political shitshow, and he has had his own problems to begin with so I am happy he is getting everything he deserves
[6:38:40] upinurguts: Umm Classic took almost no money away from retail. Classic has been years in DEV as a side hustle for the CnD's that went out over private Servers. All Classic Servers did was give the old school players the environment to play in
[6:38:46] biscuitness: Even Path of Exile changed their next expac because of Cyberpunk
[6:38:51] CubasMaster: What is cyberpunk? LoL
[6:38:53] xdunpealx: gosh damn how many alts do you have now, i went to walmart and came back and you still doing this
[6:38:59] xdunpealx: is leveling that easy?
[6:39:00] messinna: is Sl lunch will be at midnight in EU?
[6:39:00] Madnezz123: or cyberpunk release is irrelevant
[6:39:00] Motivess: you can't clear naxx under an hour, you'd have to kill each boss in under a min or something, which is impossible on some
[6:39:05] Collected1: TheScubaSteve693 : yeah it's interesting politics is getting into Twitch.
[6:39:05] duffluv22: hey...Activision had its hands in this move
[6:39:06] crawcook: If you have a nice guild on Classic I think Classic is fun. It's just another experience.
[6:39:07] biscuitness: Q4 is really crowded
[6:39:13] cabalish: naxx dec. 3rd
[6:39:16] MILESkg21: EXACTLY
[6:39:19] ArcaneLight: LUL yep
[6:39:28] Schug: Cyberpunk the biggest release since GTA V
[6:39:30] xdunpealx: doesnt Xbox come out 22nd?
[6:39:34] Colt_Engineer: their smart
[6:39:34] SeckSymbols: Cyberpunk is moving releases around like GTA/Red Dead does
[6:39:49] Colt_Engineer: they're*
[6:39:52] JoshStryker: hi
[6:39:53] BearOfLight: So you're doing a nice extra long stream to make up for the last couple days right? ;)
[6:39:57] papaPathos: there are more factors playing into release date planning than the competition. sure, it plays a role. but it aint the only deciding factor. PoE just admitted it being one, ye
[6:40:00] Apheelia: I could care less about cyber punk. I dont have time for other games lol
[6:40:09] biscuitness: And again , in general there's so much shit in the next 2 months. Esp with new consoles. Nintendo isn't really even trying this season.
[6:40:22] apopthis: Honestly. Is it a bad thing for other game companies to see that? I mean they know their players want to play it. They know that they will not have a successful launch or play time when Cyberpunk comes out. It's smart, and your very active can focus on games they want too
[6:40:30] upinurguts: its cause POE had on of its worse seasons around a Wow release
[6:40:31] Madnezz123: cyberpunk will be a thing for a couple of days
[6:40:51] SeckSymbols: I still don't think that Shadowlands is ready
[6:40:51] biscuitness: Welll.... Nov 23th is WoW's anniversary.
[6:40:53] Coriollis: yeah PoE is like on life support atm waiting for PoE 2
[6:41:08] keeindordel: look at the bears! :D
[6:41:12] papaPathos: going by the witcher 3 release, cyberpunk will be shitshow for the first month anyways.
[6:41:14] crawcook: It will be like Witcher 3 and tons of playes played Witcher 3, if Cyberpunk will be good of course.

[6:46:05] Ortinoth: @chojoe25 farm raw mats - ore, herbs leather
[6:46:18] papaPathos: @biscuitness they were announced within a month's time from each other, ye. cp in january, w3 in february 2013
[6:46:25] NBK_Sethus: finally some good news, WoW music is beyond epic
[6:46:25] Madnezz123: @mrpresbaby its a demon ram

[6:47:24] chojoe25: @chojoe25 what mats though, BFA mats are worth nothing and why are old content mats worth more? Mount farming and DEing items for epic shards seems pretty weird that the old shards are worth more. even Chaos Shards are worth like 150 gold on my server. ran Emerald Nightmare and got like 30 shards solo
[6:47:25] Madnezz123: is there a new mount you can get from scourge event?
[6:47:50] Takobaited: We need a moobot command to answer that DMCA question lmao

[6:48:47] GamerKillance: @Towelliee So how do you like the new massive nerfs to cov's and the buff to legendaries? Seems like Blizz listened and made them cosmetic at this point

[7:21:46] Kromede: damn thats an AWESOME announcement Towelliee towHAMUP
[7:21:52] fewyn: What should I level my Worgen as (for heritage armor)? DK or Druid?
[7:21:53] swordart_19: ONLY SHIELDS AND RADIANCE GIVE ATONEMENT
[7:21:54] Heinzburger: look in skills for atonment
[7:21:55] MOLAR305: its tracking it in lux's wa
[7:21:57] soysos91: you'd have to set it up
[7:22:00] xdunpealx: its the buff on your target, UI so far, nothing on your grid or Vuhdo whatever that is
[7:22:04] lel3owski: @swordart_19 wrong
[7:22:08] au_ne: if you use vuhdo its much easyer
[7:22:14] Forlagon: @Towelliee Holy is much better healing without gear. I had a hard time as Disc
[7:22:14] swordart_19: @lel3owski since when
[7:22:15] Lulaboo: Omg Ramparts
[7:22:18] Dyasis: @au_ne he is using vuhdo
[7:22:27] Silentcrits: got the horseman mount today 1st try!
[7:22:27] lel3owski: @swordart_19 pre-patch perhaps? i just leveled a priest and am playing priest
[7:22:30] xdunpealx: setting up VuhDo is a pain in the ass
[7:22:41] lel3owski: @swordart_19 *playing disc
[7:22:42] soysos91: could mouseover your healing in details and see if it's working
[7:22:54] Shok1597: if you use vuhdo you have to up up a hot icon for it even though its not a hot
[7:22:56] swordart_19: @lel3owski i play disco have 2 I barely use these KEKW
[7:22:57] au_ne: @Dyasis oh mb
[7:23:00] Murlocz: Are these Luxtos WAe?
[7:23:04] FiberZ_: Power word sheild him
[7:23:11] SeckSymbols: Its definitely a spam healer, schism into smite on repeat
[7:23:12] Dyasis: @au_ne all good
[7:23:13] xdunpealx: yeah more Shield
[7:23:14] KizaruGR: I actually don't prefer discipline because I always feel like I don't heal much
[7:23:20] swordart_19: @lel3owski most unnoticeable change for me then
[7:23:24] Brodih_: I like Renew alot as a priest
[7:23:24] MOLAR305: @Towelliee Lux's WA is top left for atonement above pennance
[7:23:34] lel3owski: @swordart_19 yeah must be a new change because ive only recently played disc for the first time
[7:23:34] reddjarum: shields are part of the healing mechanics of disc
[7:23:37] Kebabit0: What's your route for leveling so fast ? @Towelliee
[7:23:38] SeckSymbols: Always penance enemies
[7:23:42] swordart_19: @kizarugr for that you got holy
[7:23:53] swordart_19: yes
[7:23:57] SeckSymbols: Yes
[7:23:59] sxarthur: 50%
[7:24:03] Kromede: the one day i wanted to play a panda warrior, all names i choose were not available, watching star trek and tried Picard ... yep i have a panda warrior named Picard KEKWlaugh
[7:24:04] RuthlessWelshy: fiddy percent of it
[7:24:04] kenphil: yes a % of the damage you deal heals people with atonement
[7:24:04] Riddlz: yes
[7:24:04] SeckSymbols: Keep atonement up and damage enemies
[7:24:07] swordart_19: MORE you pump more heal
[7:24:08] MisterBongwater: yes you will rely a lot on shadow mend though
[7:24:10] Anteroz1994: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:24:12] xdunpealx: yeah Shield, Shadow Mend him and then dps
[7:24:12] cruzeal: monkaS
[7:24:16] showmethesugar35: Just go holy
[7:24:20] KizaruGR: Yea, holy is a lot better for me
[7:24:22] reddjarum: disc priest is more about preventing damage
[7:24:24] MisterBongwater: disc is a little rough early on
[7:24:24] gold9871: more intel makes yer healing allot stronger
[7:24:29] KizaruGR: Isn't renew a Holy spell?
[7:24:31] soysos91: boss
[7:24:37] xdunpealx: yes Kiz
[7:24:39] swordart_19: @kizarugr yes
[7:24:45] SeckSymbols: Penance on enemies is preferable
[7:24:46] Heinzburger: your dot damage heals them too. dot all mobs and then put shields on your team or mends on your team and you do alot of healing per tic
[7:24:49] SeckSymbols: with Atonement up
[7:24:51] MisterBongwater: holy is a little better early you get more healing up front
[7:24:55] swordart_19: I HATE DK tanks as disco
[7:24:57] Moonphire: DK's are spiky AF
[7:25:09] iamshwasted: blood dks at low level have 0 sustainability lol
[7:25:09] Coriollis: if dk are spiky u should try healing a dh :D
[7:25:20] Moonphire: DK= yo-yo
[7:25:20] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[7:25:23] lilhellionOG: is there a command for @Towelliee addons and setup?
[7:25:24] Sanvinar: Why u cant spec in healer xD
[7:25:28] LuciWho: 6 secs off atonement from shadowmend, 15 seconds from powerword shield
[7:25:33] Wcvechten: low level DH is pain
[7:25:39] hutzika: !ui
[7:25:39] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee UI! Grab it now HERE: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Dont forget to make backups!
[7:25:46] iamshwasted: low levels its always better just to go Holy so you can keep everyone alive a lot easier
[7:25:47] swordart_19: @sanvinarius disco is healer
[7:25:48] xdunpealx: its harder at least to me, early levels you cant dps enough because the mobs die quick but DK takes spike dmg
[7:25:49] Coriollis: dh is good but has calcium drops when u don't expect it :)
[7:25:52] NinjaGlovz: What time is the announcement tomorrow?
[7:25:55] SeckSymbols: @Towelliee Try penancing the enemies instead of your party members
[7:25:58] FiberZ_: Shield + shadow mend on ally’s penence, mind blast, smite of enemies @towelliee
[7:26:03] kenphil: that's why I love disc :)
[7:26:10] stunah1: shadowlands is worse then bfa
[7:26:18] SeckSymbols: Disc is the most fun healing spec imo
[7:26:29] Brodih_: Renew is a lvl 12 HoT, you should have it, pop it on group and focus heals on tank
[7:26:30] MisterBongwater: I love disc too, takes some practice but it's easily the most engaging spec
[7:26:35] swordart_19: @stunah1 exactly bye
[7:26:46] xdunpealx: Disc priest = always doing something
[7:26:59] FiberZ_: Ive been maining disc since MOP beat class :)
[7:27:04] swordart_19: @qhaz_ that is holy
[7:27:17] SeckSymbols: @Towelliee Try using penance on an enemy when atonement is on the tank
[7:27:26] Brodih_: @swordart_19 oh its a talent now ? my bad
[7:27:26] Asuo_: Radiance is is your best friend and before that healing is a real bitch
[7:27:36] MisterBongwater: honestly early disc is rought because you'll notice your atonement healing is like 3hp
[7:27:39] iamshwasted: yeah honestly your tank is pretty cheeks too tbh XD
[7:27:40] heliwonk: just need a prot pala, then there is no aggro problems
[7:27:46] SeckSymbols: Ah, I was seeing you use it on tanks, nevermind

[7:46:02] nocturnal_2195: @deucezzzz you can do world quests to get some gear
[7:46:04] BuddySinister: Was it always planned to be 2 weeks though?
[7:46:06] swordart_19: @deucezzzz get some gear dungeons, raid, main quests from zones you get/clean quest logs and on map, not much point gearing
[7:46:07] crawcook: I think the cyberpunk part is coincidence, SL was delayed first so they probably already had an idea what should be the next date.
[7:46:10] Drakenking: @deucezzzz some of the legendary cloak questline gives gear, but you want to focus probably on your neck piece and cloak as they will provide the most bang for your buck in terms of gear to help you level
[7:46:52] laughinbuddha: Need J.P. from Grandma's Boy on the dev team
[7:47:04] deucezmongooses: thanks everyone!

[7:48:43] papaPathos: @insanity2195 it doesnt really go away, but it becomes useless when in the shadowlands

[7:51:50] Dyriks: go dyriks go!
[7:52:19] Dyriks: nooo I died
[7:52:25] TheCliffyShow: I think Shadowlands doesn't really exist. It's all a conspiracy to take our minds off of everything else. And all these streamers "playing" the "beta" are in on it.
[7:52:26] Sprucemoose: they're much more prevalent that's fo rsure
[7:52:29] DoGGyFromPlanetWoof: thats cuz you cant edit files on console
[7:52:30] SwAgReAper_: you will get all of them because of cross-play

[7:53:03] duffluv22: I dont understand why people need to hack....they dont get any money from it.
[7:53:04] SwAgReAper_: You can't leave hackers because of the cross-play
[7:53:04] clinch33: its because of the high frame rate with aim assist
[7:53:07] toxic_casual: maybe because everyone else has aim assist on console and not pc?

[7:59:40] Chibs243: Put more damage out get more heals
[8:00:02] KizaruGR: Yea because Atonement heals for a percentage of damage done, which is kinda garbage xD
[8:00:07] grahame64: i switched to Holy it's brilliant
[8:00:10] Aeylid: atonement healing was off by a factor of 10 before so if normally it did 20% healing based off the damage, it was doing 2%
[8:00:17] Aeylid: i thought i heard they fixed it but i dont know
[8:00:20] Dyriks: my last group didn't, and we all got oneshot LOL
