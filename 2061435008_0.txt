[2:54:22] lilyosa: bro i can sigil meld now insane tech
[2:54:25] BigBlazingBull: fair
[2:54:37] Soebbah: for class fantasy sakes I feel like Dark Ranger should be like a bow/dagger shadow assassin
[2:54:40] Soebbah: doesn't really go with pets
[2:54:56] chubbytheboi: Cus simp
[2:54:56] wizard396396: üé∂ Waiting for the sun.. waiting.. waiting
[2:54:57] qda__: tbh give dark ranger to rogue if they wana use sylvanas
[2:54:59] qda__: modCheck
[2:55:02] lilyosa: bro everyone giving me shit
[2:55:05] HeyRELAXX: What's up. Wanna play bg? Or arena
[2:55:06] lilyosa: i was on tich for years
[2:55:11] lilyosa: decided to come back
[2:55:15] Daara87: ranged rogue spec when
[2:55:24] yo6afire: Nathanos was a dark ranger and had pets
[2:55:35] qda__: they could have atleast gave shadow hunter to SV
[2:55:39] qda__: but nope Sadeg
[2:55:46] chubbytheboi: Give rogues Dark ranger and have them do ranged attacks with a hidden arm crossbow like Assassin's creed type shit lul
[2:56:03] Soebbah: isn't that basically outlaw
[2:56:04] Soebbah: LUL
[2:56:09] chubbytheboi: @yo6afire Yeah but Nathanos was a bitch too
[2:56:23] qda__: would have been cool to have shadow hunter like Zuljin in the game
[2:56:23] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: i just wanna know how they will work in PvP
[2:56:32] qda__: what did they even give SV? LUL
[2:56:39] HeyRELAXX: Let's arena
[2:56:43] chubbytheboi: Cooties
[2:56:55] BigBlazingBull: im personally biased cause im more a BM player and i love dark ranger aesthetic, but i def see the reasoning for why it should be a survival thing instead
[2:57:03] qda__: yo what chubby just said is INSANE LOL
[2:57:06] qda__: hire him blizz
[2:57:18] wizard396396: So how was everyones night? üôÇ
[2:57:24] Soebbah: dark ranger should be lone wolf MM
[2:57:37] Soebbah: and surv
[2:57:55] yo6afire: @chubbytheboi oh like the Diablo 3 demon hunter
[2:57:58] chubbytheboi: Tbh, Dark Ranger wouldn't quite fit current SV either imo. Current SV is Rexxar based
[2:58:19] qda__: they need to figure out hunter tho, its like half the devs want mm no pet and the others want a hunter pet based class
[2:58:21] chubbytheboi: @yo6afire Yeah, exactly
[2:58:28] qda__: and rn its mixed with both and bit wonky lol
[2:58:44] chubbytheboi: Just revert SV to MoP
