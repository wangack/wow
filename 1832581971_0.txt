[2:37:29] coldprophecy9: d4 will be a very fun game to play and watch stream
[2:37:29] grongamigna: the butcher meme was immortalized by how traumatic that boss was, this is a boss you find alone in a room with a ton of corpses that have been sodomized until they died, d1 was seriously brutal Kreygasm
