[2:57:48] tangdill: They say he might had something on his body
[2:57:50] Meatchopper: Rumor has it that Hans got a hold of Magnus' prep work and potentially trained against a bot
[2:58:04] tangdill: Or ear that some one would give info fromchess engine
[2:58:10] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[3:58:31] theretsofpuraes: I think the recent ban-wave incentivizes people to farm on roads rather than do objectives.
[3:58:49] theretsofpuraes: the algorithm that decides who to ban only looks at leaderboard numbers.

[4:48:51] don_bonjino: i have mained ret since wotlk and always will
[4:49:04] OldJak: which is the reason why 50% of the woltk playerbase is playing paladin
[4:49:14] iiamsly: Is this retail or watlk ?
[4:49:24] OldJak: and then a good 15 to 20% is probably playing death knight

[6:59:51] IExsusI: Rogues are terrifying as a ret if they know what they're doing.
[6:59:57] TSG123: imagine classic cata lol
[7:00:02] JakeyyyGee: Nah surely it goes to Legion???
[7:00:02] Oorlich: i want them to do a runescape and add community agreed changes
[7:00:13] redseptemberx: Nobody will play classic cata IMO
[7:00:18] onous_: Nobody wants Cata classic
[7:00:19] JakeyyyGee: Legion HAS to be NEXT
[7:00:23] tolginyoo: imagine if they went up to MoP classic and then stopped there and we had MoP forever... It would be awesome
[7:00:26] Pallyofhell: wrath wont retain these numbers
[7:00:35] AnitaGrnKard: They've already said they consider cata to now as modern wow so i don't expect anything after wrath for a good long while
[7:00:44] onous_: They need to skip to mist and forget Cata ever happened.
[7:00:44] fiingerz: they wont stop with classic servers makes good money smart business choice
[7:00:50] ragnar2088: no blizzard knows ppl hate cata...blizzard told asmongold they dont know where they are going...they should just continue Wrath with new content
[7:00:56] Shadeflayer: what do you guys think best alch specialization will be
[7:00:59] badkarma2030: save his name
[7:01:00] Shadeflayer: flasks potions or transmutes
[7:01:00] ragnar2088: wrath was the number 1 expansion ever
[7:01:07] fiingerz: no need to make new content when old content makes money
[7:01:20] JakeyyyGee: transmutes $$$$
[7:01:28] badkarma2030: tyle.
[7:01:32] fiingerz: cata and mist were good expansions
[7:01:35] ragnar2088: blizzard knows 100% ppl will not play cata...ppl hate cata
[7:01:40] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[7:01:46] codyreallyotg: Just make it wow classic and make new classic content
[7:01:46] IExsusI: Swifty, are you hoping they do Cata classic?
[7:01:53] AnitaGrnKard: @ragnar2088 in your opinion.
[7:01:55] fiingerz: ill play cata
[7:01:59] fiingerz: XD '
[7:02:10] badkarma2030: kara music :)
[7:02:11] Pallyofhell: there's actually a large community that would play cata
[7:02:15] DrKushTV: only thing i liked about cata was RBG's
[7:02:17] IExsusI: Dude, warriors were god tier during Cata.
[7:02:20] King_Jacula: than mists
[7:02:20] BigHawkWoW: they will go to mop and stop
[7:02:22] onous_: Yeah not play it
[7:02:30] Pallyofhell: wrath babies need to stop talking
[7:02:33] mdo20: They should do a different timeline and make another xpac classic plus
[7:02:36] Lithium24: RBGs are amazing
[7:02:36] BigHawkWoW: everything after mop was a travasty
[7:02:37] Gandimir: @ragnar2088 mop was, but ppl are nostalgic about wotlk
[7:02:46] Auto79: warrriors are good in every xpac
[7:02:47] Sphinx2k: How long will interest in WOLK last though? Seemed like BC was only recent.
[7:02:50] itswilly_g: need to focus on retail and stop splitting player base.
[7:02:51] badkarma2030: go left cut of
[7:02:52] superluboss: if they do Cata, there wont be even half the population on wrath
[7:02:55] ragnar2088: no it doesnt swifty lol....they will lose so much traffic going to cata
[7:02:57] Shmoz: I hope they keep wrath servers before they move on to cata
[7:02:58] mdo20: Yeah wrath plus
[7:02:58] ragnar2088: no they will not lol
[7:02:58] reddnine: legion was solid
[7:02:58] Macrel: i wont be doing cata once wrath is over i think my classic wow career will end
[7:02:59] fiingerz: i got my 2400 in MOP on my warrior from watching swifty content
[7:03:08] fiingerz: so i cant wait for classic mop
[7:03:11] Pallyofhell: wrath won't retain the numbers
[7:03:18] Skulligan79: Was Cata when we had Gladiator Warrior?  Or was that MoP?
[7:03:32] mdo20: Idk wrath could warmane had been super populated for years
[7:03:39] x_cX_x: send a dk to death grip him onto the cap point
[7:03:41] ragnar2088: no wrath is not just nostalgic...There is a reason wrath is the numbre 1 for private servers...because wrath is what most enjoyed
[7:03:50] Pallyofhell: yeah cause they spent gold
[7:03:51] Oorlich: wdym wrath wont retain? most private servers that were full were wrath servers
[7:03:53] badkarma2030: kill healer
[7:03:53] Lithium24: no MMO retains the numbers any more. They release an expansion/new content, they get a spike, then it dwindles again. That's consistent for every MMO
[7:03:59] fowlentv: did they just add a new server for xfers?
[7:04:03] ragnar2088: am reason server have 12k ques right now...cause its wrath..
[7:04:05] badkarma2030: nice try
[7:04:09] ragnar2088: if this was cata...U WOULD NOT HAVE 12K QS
[7:04:25] Goonzz999: flask
[7:04:27] Pallyofhell: MoP did
[7:04:29] TSG123: wotlk for sure
[7:04:29] IExsusI: I think it was Wrath or Mists that lasted the longest but I could be wrong
[7:04:32] Shmoz: @ragnar2088 If you go by the numbers wrath was the biggest xpac. Started losing subs at the start of cata and beyond.
[7:04:34] xJPMx: cata was a while too i thought
[7:04:35] TSG123: i wouldnt be here if it wasnt for wotlk lol
[7:04:37] Oorlich: Wrath has lasted longer for a lot more people than the others
[7:04:51] DrKushTV: fugazi drkushKEKWGOLD
[7:04:55] Lithium24: if you look up the numbers, wrath and cata held their numbers best
[7:05:06] ragnar2088: litearlly 100s of private servers are all wrath...warmane has been lving for how long?
[7:05:10] NelsonGamingShow: swiftyCRISP 🤯
[7:05:12] fiingerz: i think people forget how good "firelands" and dragonsoul "up till deathwing fight" was
[7:05:15] Pallyofhell: cata had the most balanced pvp
[7:05:25] Verdammt_Misfit: hey whats up
[7:05:26] ragnar2088: warmane has stead numbers for the past 10 years lol....never died once
[7:05:29] Shapes_Tv: @Swifty What addon is it that shows enemy Class colors in their health bar?
[7:05:32] ragnar2088: or how ever long its been
[7:05:34] Tedayen: MoP
[7:05:35] reddnine: MOP was awesome
[7:05:35] Verdammt_Misfit: finally home from work heesh
[7:05:37] Bukumx: if you played a rogue yeah cata was balanced
[7:05:42] Tedayen: was most balanced
[7:05:46] badkarma2030: then when mop poped up.most stoped
[7:05:50] IExsusI: I dunno about balanced in Cata. Soloing literal groups of people as a warrior was kinda standard back then lol
[7:05:52] Lithium24: @ragnar2088 that's because there's no casuals on pservers
[7:05:56] Weeho_: !build
[7:05:56] sarenix: ye lich king i think is the most famous pvp expansion
[7:05:57] badkarma2030: pc
[7:06:02] codyreallyotg: Cata good pvp besides blood dk
[7:06:03] fiingerz: XD
[7:06:08] ragnar2088: lol cata had the most balance in pvp
[7:06:10] fowlentv: cata pvp was not the most balanced lol
[7:06:14] Macrel: @Swifty i know you have Engi where did you farm Fel iron ore
[7:06:14] ragnar2088: lol
[7:06:18] kylerkgo: ret is way too OP
[7:06:26] tolginyoo: @ragnar2088 i played all expansions and PvP-wise MoP is by far my favorite, wotlk and legion were lore-wise and pve-wise was so fun too
[7:06:38] RedMart1n: thanks to @blaster i started to watch your streams more, its so relaxing blastt3Heart thank you too

[7:07:37] fowlentv: pvp was the best in MoP imo
[7:07:58] IExsusI: Bro that rogue totally has it in for you
[7:08:14] tolginyoo: wrath will die eventually, no new content means inevitable death because you get bored eventually from doing same thing over and over
[7:08:27] DrKushTV: duels at the black market auction house :D
[7:08:39] IExsusI: Last time I ran into you in BG's was during Cata and I was the big sad after being steamrolled
