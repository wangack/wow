[1:04:22] yosuke_91: love
[1:04:32] Wintertid: @Axestro Oh yeah Affli is really good now. I play it, but i want mage level op affli for just 1 day
[1:04:33] IAmJoey: @yo_abeed gaming
[1:04:33] yosuke_91: still love you
[1:04:34] Pixhull: Yeah I mean you can play any class and still get high keys, but when you are min maxing it comes with finding the best classes for the job and here you got it.
[1:04:43] holypaladinyuh: Dratnos üíì üòç üò©
[1:04:45] emilbilen: they should release a buff to spicve things up a bit
[1:05:03] Brackker: make a rule, cant play the same class twice in a row Kappa
[1:05:04] dalles7: the teams get loot when the dungeon ends?
[1:05:09] wehiluss: kok
[1:05:10] regulater45: Tank doing more damage than the aug
[1:05:12] ShadowLex: or nerf mages
[1:05:24] Sleepypan: @dalles7 no its a tournament where they have max gear its not about gear
[1:05:24] tABUU_gaming: didnt echo 2 chest hoi last time ? the 27?
[1:05:25] Gamerhcp: seblehDinkdonk show us NA's last hope seblehDinkdonk
[1:05:27] IAmJoey: @regulater45 defyFreg
[1:05:33] Dekronus: @dalles7 it's tournament realm, they can pick their gear and are all basically bis
[1:05:35] Yager05: @regulater45 dmg meters are counting it bad. known issue
[1:05:39] Baileysimpson76: Wow every team is the same exact classes, thats not fun
[1:05:42] NeuroTheGamer: On live there's a lot of diversity in Aug stating/gearing. Would be  nice to see what all these Augs are running side by side
[1:05:50] dalles7: @Sleepypan ioh i see thanks
[1:05:53] Miichalek_: @Sleepypan saying max gear is not true. They can't have tertiary stats like avoidance, leech etc.
[1:05:55] TheRealKingSonic: Definitely need to make the rule that all classes need to be played or can‚Äôt use the same comp twice etc it‚Äôs annoying and boring rn
[1:05:56] Ladiplace: Echo slower
[1:05:57] OPiece2: ....
[1:05:58] Cuhrismuh: Much diversity
[1:05:58] Coryrin: I just wanna see Echo lose

[1:06:07] goldfishie1: gotta love how balanced the classes are rn.  look at all this variety
[1:06:16] Rogastik: @NeuroThaGamer what diversity? You just stack mastery and ilvl
[1:06:17] Valhooli: @TheRealKingSonic so dont watch
[1:06:17] emilbilen: what is the % of mage/spirest total
[1:06:18] TCGRebel: @imLoGiC1 you dont have to be here
[1:06:23] Sleepypan: @Sleepypan max gear means max ilvl gear tertiaries arent ilvl
[1:06:25] ElSamino: @goldfishie1 Great push is always min maxed tbh
[1:06:26] x_Scy: ah nvm, now it's not grey
[1:06:29] headlocks000: @goldfishie1 first time here?
[1:06:33] Lorotard: @goldfishie1 there has never been variety, u play whats best, stop crying
[1:06:39] Laech: why they play evoker so low dmg? LOL i do more on my 414 rogue XD
[1:06:42] djthednadan: big buff or nerf this weekend????
[1:06:51] Cordeviola: The only difference between the 6 teams is the name peepoSad
[1:06:55] giLDslick: if TGP without these 5 classes should have a bit more exciting ResidentSleeper
[1:07:00] Brackker: peepoSad lmao
[1:07:03] TCGRebel: @Laech because they boost everyone else damage and healing
[1:07:04] yosuke_91: letss goooooo
[1:07:05] hasel93: @Lorotard *** the stas say you are wrong :)
[1:07:06] Multiidx: @emilbilen by the looks of it.. 100%
[1:07:10] LeeMoreTouchy: @giLDslick dw warrior will be played
[1:07:11] Cuhrismuh: @laech you are dense huh
[1:07:14] NeuroTheGamer: @Rogastik Obviously. There's not a ton of consistency in crit or haste after mastery. Or which embellishments
[1:07:15] soflesxo: cut off is dropping - start nerving dungeons and not classes
[1:07:18] goldfishie1: no1's crying, obvi you gotta play whats best to compete.  just wish there were more 'bests'.

[1:07:38] yosuke_91: lol
[1:07:40] tyger12: @headlocks000 name a better combo? spriest/mage
[1:07:41] Brackker: chat stop fighting peepoSad
[1:07:45] Lorotard: @hasel93 didnt ask, get a r1 title first mckyCopter
[1:07:49] Rogastik: @NeuroThaGamer you can see their gear through twitch extension left side of the screen
[1:07:52] Laech: @TCGRebel lol no why they do that XD they are dps not support
[1:07:53] MoriSHinigami: are they playing with 2 healer? ( bait to get some replied)
[1:07:56] ElSamino: @Brackker DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO BUDDY
[1:07:58] giLDslick: TGP should ban these META CLASSES
[1:08:01] beardedbroo: why are there mods in PVE but in PVP people spammed like insane?
[1:08:01] damnation93: people that complain about same comp have never played in a tournament or dont like money, you use whats best, end of story
[1:08:05] ShadowLex: so unfortunate you can't even play melee because you die instantly
[1:08:06] NeuroTheGamer: ah ty!
[1:08:09] PianoBomb: how about picks and bans or some kinda class/spec draft
[1:08:16] TCGRebel: @Laech because that aug provides better utility than your rogue
[1:08:19] Hedgehoggoe: @damnation93 I don't think people are blaming the competitors for it
[1:08:25] oniris_91: Are nerfs from the MEta combo live in this tournament?
[1:08:28] hasel93: @Lorotard I got 2 :) good try tho
[1:08:30] ShadowLex: @PianoBomb best idea i've heard of
[1:08:32] TheRealKingSonic: It should be required to have a melee
[1:08:32] khandee: Doesn't the meta classes put all teams on the same footing, so the talent gets to shine through?
[1:08:33] Napknutt: i thought they fixed that sign pull
[1:08:36] BeyondBright: @Brackker Only thing I will fight for is BDK meta
[1:08:37] strbie: @giLDslick And after that ban the 5 new classes that will be the new meta.
[1:08:39] Rogastik: @oniris_91 yes
[1:08:40] Brackker: @ElSamino D:
[1:08:44] Rothon54: the tourny is to determine who plays this comp the best, look at it that way and you won't mind anymore.. only way to change would be ban spec reusing per dung or limit it to 2x dungs per spec
[1:08:44] itsjustbentv: Id be down for class picks and bans
[1:08:45] TCGRebel: @Laech and?
[1:08:47] emilbilen: they should ban a class next week, get some diversity in
[1:08:51] headlocks000: @oniris_91 yes they literally just said it
[1:08:59] Sathyron: LOOK AT THE COUNT
[1:08:59] rafael_mullerr: there's no point in decreasing numbers, you have to increase the time of skill cds...... nice nerf on mage now he stopped doing 900k overall to 850k
[1:09:18] TCGRebel: @Laech got it, you dont know
[1:09:20] moderatygos: raider.io has done some break the meta tournaments where off meta comps are played. its pretty fun, you should keep an eye out for their next one
[1:09:20] oniris_91: Thx, just joined this second, sad to still see it exclusivly
[1:09:21] ModeraYsera: be nice to eachother
[1:09:22] Axestro: @emilbilen there is no next week.
[1:09:39] baaddragon: dudes grammar makes me wanna rip my hair out
[1:09:39] damnation93: @Hedgehoggoe its just small brain players that think we will should see more variety in a tournament, they dont understand this at all
[1:09:41] Miichalek_: people being madge at fire damage, but not realizing that priest utility makes them not completely mandatory
[1:09:42] killawatts75: at top keys 50k DPS is a big difference @rafael_mullerr
[1:09:42] SylvaticSky1755: how much HP on a +27 fortifed crusher?
[1:09:43] emilbilen: they cant nerf a mage just because of 4 groups, plebs in 16s would do even less
[1:09:44] Holyskurt: @emilbilen then every team will probably replace with the same class
[1:09:45] giLDslick: so F TIER in AWC is so exciting
[1:09:47] goldfishie1: what i think people dont understand is when people complain about 1 comp being heads and shoulders above others, is that they're not attacking the players for playing it.  just kinda want it to not be so imbalanced.
[1:09:59] ShadowLex: ban mages and see how it changes things XD
[1:10:08] skottstb: well echo has the best tank to ever play the game soooo
[1:10:09] BeyondBright: @ModeraYsera Ma'am, please stay at emerald dream, our world has enough of instability already
[1:10:16] strbie: @giLDslick But if everyone play the same f tier classes we have to ban those too.
[1:10:18] ModeraYsera: @BeyondBright no
[1:10:20] headlocks000: @goldfishie1 every single spec is viable for doing your 20s with the bros. speedrunning is quite different
[1:10:23] dorilo78a: Hi chat, do we know who's in the lead?
[1:10:35] BeyondBright: @ModeraYsera Understandable, have a nice day!

[1:10:43] Meeix: whos gonna win this weekend chat, im taking notes NOTED

[1:11:13] dorilo78a: @blightrose I meant to those comparable
[1:11:14] heyitsferris: @sn_happy they buff other classes and make them strong
[1:11:17] Meeix: shyyHmm
[1:11:20] Daxinjo: @sn_happy its a supprot spec
[1:11:20] blocker94: why is meta soo hated now.. no one cried while bfa tripple outlaw^^
[1:11:21] ArrgTV: @sn_happy they buff the rest of the group (give them main statt / crit etc)

[1:12:42] damnation93: @yo_abeed game was so dead i started doing dragonriding races LUL

[1:27:39] Moobot: Check out the Raider.io highlights! https://raider.io/mdi
[1:27:46] Trcgg: @kilu augment isnt the problem, having mass dispell and preists that can PI and basically heal just as much as a healer whilst doing the 2nd highest dps in the game is the problem
[1:27:51] Kilu69: Makartimer i dont care about other mmo games KEKW

[2:09:25] spoony_x: 92 out of the top 100 public M+ runs are this comp
[2:09:43] ultideath: @Meeix do the different colored bears have different flavors?
[2:09:50] Rohaana: @Varras Even if everything was balanced properly people would still play the best comp. That's what you do when you want to win.
[2:09:52] Miichalek_: @spoony_x would be funny if the rest are neltharion lair with warrior instead of bear XD
[2:09:52] wraaith: can we ajust audio on last min game sounds
[2:09:58] Thunder4o: @TCGRebel one thing is min/maxing,other thing is every single dungeon exact same comp,atleast we could of have kinda different comps for different dungeons,that just shows how broken is exodia comp and that Blizzard are too far from any balance in M+
[2:10:06] FoxxGhostboi: Green apple flavor best near flavor

[3:29:17] ArrgTV: @pweepysonkun yes. it is 0.1% better than the 2nd best option.. so they obv. play it in a tournament

[3:30:20] kankandjur: What exactly are we looking at?  Looks quite boring and dull! What's the seasonal affix? Are there only 5 classes playable nowadays in WoW?
[3:30:21] tettles: good point
[3:30:28] Praedari: @casters, comp is looking pretty boring across all teams now.. if you didn't have to take evoker - what would you bring?

[3:31:42] BojoBoss: Have you ever seen Meeix and nagura cast together, no? Thats because they are the same person Kappa
[3:31:45] mohappyy: @Kelthiz , naah, another mage
[3:31:46] SakhetEU: We're just waiting for Meeix' main specs to become meta so she can be the expert on the desk as nobody else plays those specs
[3:31:47] Thomas_Huayra: There's only on Meeix . And it's Youix.
[3:31:48] UpadlySzczurr: @mohappyy they cant stack classes
[3:32:03] Meeix: @SakhetEU LMAO
[3:32:20] mohappyy: @UpadlySzczurr oh didn't know that
[3:32:31] Sathyron: last run ECHO used Lust on the last double Trashpack
[3:32:51] marcofellipe69: peepoPls
[3:33:18] Praedari: given the ranged magic damage of the others - not a havoc for the buff ?
[3:33:24] Sathyron: THERE IS ECHO'S LUST
[3:33:35] Thomas_Huayra: @Sathyron don't panic
[3:34:06] Kelthiz: @Praedari You could maybe make that argument yeah. I don't know havoc well enough to know if that's enough.

[3:35:24] Thomas_Huayra: The reasons for this comp is very complicated, chat. I have 500 hours in WoW, so just trust me on this.
[3:35:29] KLOMPx: remove aug fur reals
[3:35:29] Diegsu_: Standart meta class ResidentSleeper
[3:35:32] marcofellipe69: I'd put 1k on them
[3:35:33] drunkpool2: VP is bad because the mechanics were made in 2003
[3:35:36] Darkun8: Buff ret Sadge
[3:35:43] Sebleh: @sakheteu she was only allowed on the desk on the condition that her specs are no longer meta. hDH and UDK got removed from the meta as Meeix became allowed to cast. Because melee aren‚Äôt casters duh
[3:35:56] Praedari: @Thomas_Huayra 500 hours? I have 18 years....
[3:36:03] goldfishie1: i agree with @Darkun8
[3:36:08] SakhetEU: @Sebleh Now that is Omegabrain
[3:36:09] KLOMPx: aug will always be part of the meta, or irrelevant

[3:36:34] marcofellipe69: owoCheer
[3:36:35] Thomas_Huayra: @Darkun8 idk if ret's so undertuned. They're viable with less damage, just cause they're damage profile is so good, they should never really die to anything and they bring defensive utility.
[3:36:38] kraiser1624: nvm, its legendary, I see it now xd
[3:36:41] eenton: @Praedari 500 houra? I havve 1800+ io...
[3:36:45] B3nbu: If you are not high io (500+), you shouldn't talk in this chat

[3:37:15] pezinafm: will be interesting if Echo go full out or if they save strats for DF S4
[3:37:17] WCPEllipsis: @Thomas_Huayra Ret's issue is they just have negative ST / boss damage.
[3:37:18] KLOMPx: yea so you bring an hpal instead
[3:37:21] drunkpool2: lets go NA!
[3:37:27] pezinafm: melee this season is not a thing
[3:37:32] PadreDenisovich: 500 io high io damn.. im worried
[3:37:35] KLOMPx: ret dam def needs a buff
[3:37:41] goldfishie1: vanilla baby here, im old afffff
[3:37:42] Praedari: @OmzoGG agree - echo usually have something extra to bring at some point
[3:37:48] B3nbu: If you are not high io (500+), you shouldn't talk in this chat Û†ÄÄ
[3:37:49] theslinny: @iDanth I think Echo is currently the most efficient group, NA last hope is 1 key behind ish

[3:37:56] marcofellipe69: BasedGod
[3:38:02] blue2161: ret got buffed like a week ago. Not ST, but it was something
[3:38:24] Rudric_Ice: when u see guardian druid in every dungeon u know your game is poorly balanced
[3:38:32] OmzoGG: @praedari Exactly - and it will be great to see again
[3:38:33] thejester1979: if you not high IQ (2500+), you shouldn't talk in this chat, plink

[3:38:35] eenton: @kizuw no cuz then half of chat will stop typing...
[3:38:36] KLOMPx: if you consider that a buff lol
[3:38:43] Fallenarch11: if you havent played BG3 for atleast 100h you shouldn't watch TGP
[3:38:44] kizuw: @eenton based
[3:38:48] sussydaki: ECHO
[3:38:55] Miichalek_: @Rudric_Ice not every dungeon. Neltharion lair was played with protection warrior, stop baiting
[3:38:55] KLOMPx: 12% consc buff, that accounts for less than 1% overall woweee

[3:39:34] Thomas_Huayra: I'm a ret main, but I'll still warn that if you buff ret's damage to be similar to stuff like sub rogue or Spriest, you'll probably break the meta pretty hard
[3:39:36] Xyronic: man...
[3:39:40] marcofellipe69: erpplexed bought to melt the boss

[3:42:09] bootymcboatface22: We need a Naguura and Meeix combo!!!
[3:42:10] Praedari: Meeix plays a real class, it needs more druids to counter a single DH
[3:42:11] ggDoA: A combination of owls and bears. I've seen this somewhere...
[3:42:13] kaoticbacon: like these are top tier players why cant they use off meta classes actually have fun ..rant over

[3:44:08] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/TGPS2_GlobalFinals
[3:44:18] Thomas_Huayra: This meta comp is so broken. Every evening in TGP it's Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, Xyronic, Dratnos and DOA. ArgieB8
[3:44:28] Sebleh: They have both casted in the past @bloodbottler_88 they could do it.

[3:45:38] SylvaticSky1755: tettles as tank meeix as healer and dratnos, doa, and xyro as dps
[3:45:45] Praedari: I think they should do like an open mike night and give a member of chat a 5 min slot to cast... we could all rotate it over teh evening
[3:45:53] Meeix: @SylvaticSky1755 id bring back my priest for this
[3:45:53] TheRealGiglers: @jedimind_lbc don't tell me you got so upset you had to whisp me :D
[3:45:58] dethbybunnies: @SylvaticSky1755 meeix healing KEKW
[3:46:04] Thomas_Huayra: Actually we should have a showmatch :p Meeix, Xyronic, Tettles, DOA and Naguura also join in a push and Dratnos casts it
[3:46:05] Yoshjj: @burgahh though surely there are specs they are more comfortable with that they might prefer to play?
[3:46:11] merlinwow: @Unstabledh where?
[3:46:21] Servachuels: Good thing blizzard fixed the broken specs that were too overpowered, it would be so boring if everyone used the exact same comp they did on the groups
[3:46:21] Ravvq: how many teams are eliminated today? if any
[3:46:26] bashbonk: who is streaming today

[3:50:06] iguana_13: thanks! i thought it was naguura but it's been years since i last heard her
[3:50:15] mohappyy: dumb as it gets
[3:50:21] GoQuantum: How is NAs Last Hope score 105? 26+24+29+27 = 106 in EU math
[3:50:27] Kelthiz: @PacsWoW It's not dumb per say, but it is meta. The only dungeon you might see different is Nelth's lair
[3:50:29] Thomas_Huayra: @iguanaaa13 it is Naguura

[3:52:24] Nidalee55: moonkin speaking volume down emote
[3:52:38] Meeix: updated @GoQuantum
[3:52:43] SakhetEU: They were able to 2 chest the 29 BECAUSE they didn't invite you @tettles
[3:52:52] Sleepypan: I finally got my sark cloak :)
[3:52:54] Thomas_Huayra: @SakhetEU D: toxic
[3:52:56] Arubicon: i sure wish they did a better balancing for classes so that more toons are viable in this
[3:53:00] GoQuantum: @Meeix thx
[3:53:05] Dendii7: @xyronic wya
[3:53:09] Riftwalker_Fitzy: Don't pully the moonkin players
[3:53:19] SakhetEU: Bit of memeing should be allowed
[3:53:24] Teshinator95: thankgod they nerfed exodia comp! we can finally watch different classes! :D
[3:53:25] Nidalee55: Thomas_Huayra he just meant because with him it would've bee +3 ofc :)

[3:54:18] Moobot: The Great Push Format Explainer: https://youtu.be/iSB2Oo5VIHE
[3:54:20] aarseths: A fun tournament could be where teams bans dungeons/classes and sees who can get the furthest :D
[3:54:37] rexal_the_saltiest_brit: @kizuw mages can't solo tgp, shush.
[3:54:39] nedk0: Where I can see the char for standings
[3:54:40] Snayderino: @aarseths agreed
[3:54:43] B3nbu: @Thomas_Huayra Drohgoh is now a 1500 io player then, you said it not me
[3:55:05] kizuw: @rexal_the_saltiest_brit i'm bear Joel
[3:55:19] SakhetEU: Let's make a competition who can push the highest keys possible and then make it impossible to push the highest keys. Great idea chat
[3:55:23] Thomas_Huayra: @B3nbu I unfortunately didn't get the reference, sorry :(
[3:55:31] kishkutv: Anyone know if LeMike qualified in this years TGP?
[3:55:41] B3nbu: the reference is drohgoh has quite a high ego
[3:55:51] Thomas_Huayra: ah okay
[3:55:53] aarseths: Cant really fault either the tournament holders or the teams for the zero variety in comps. Still fun though :D
[3:55:55] drunkpool2: is there a timer somewhere
[3:56:05] drunkpool2: for overall TGP
[3:56:13] Sleepypan: Halls *shudders*
[3:56:15] vroht: @kishkutv He and his team didn‚Äôt
[3:56:16] Thomas_Huayra: @drunkpool2 On my oven
[3:56:20] Kelthiz: @drunkpool2 End of day timer?
[3:56:20] ModeraYsera: ~ 1 hr and 45 mins left
[3:56:30] Multikillolek: why azuna, nerf tank team doesnt participate?
[3:56:31] EzzLyfe: @drunkpool2 no but it's 1 hour 44 minutes until last run
[3:56:33] Meeix: @drunkpool2 if you look at ur clock, its in 1hour and 44mins when they have to start last key
[3:56:35] NoobenAlex: Good to see that the god comp is no longer
[3:56:38] kishkutv: @vroht cheers
[3:56:44] SultanGaming44: How many days left?
[3:56:48] drunkpool2: thanks!
[3:56:55] SakhetEU: After Echo is done with this 28 VP they only need to do halls though
[3:56:59] Zlywiarz: @Shagran44 4
[3:57:06] fernandobrigante: Is Echo out !
[3:57:07] theslinny: @Shagran44 this is the first day it ends on sunday
[3:57:16] aarseths: Has the nerf to the comps affected the dungeon timers bigtime or nah?
[3:57:19] Multikillolek: @Shagran44 friday, saturday and sunday = 3 days
[3:57:24] kizuw: echo is out due to maltafied affix sorry lads
[3:57:26] Meeix: baseg naguura
[3:57:29] eternalfear: @fernandobrigante i think its pretty impossible echo doesnt win this
[3:57:44] Snayderino: @aarseths probably not much b/c the utility didn't get nerfed
[3:57:47] EzzLyfe: @aarseths not so far, but we will see once they hit the 30-31 range
[3:57:59] tibolt: is there a link to talents like they have for MDI?
[3:58:02] Snayderino: which is the whole reason you take the god comp
[3:58:03] SakhetEU: I think they'll save the 31 for tomorrow to put a bit more prep into it, bit of a waste to go for that in your overtime
[3:58:04] SultanGaming44: Any drops happening
[3:58:13] damnation93: 35 FH is timeable, they just cant time it NotLikeThis
[3:58:16] LGhost: 2 chesting the 29 prob took a bit of practice no? they prob plan on the 31
[3:58:21] Praedari: which boss makes 31 FH too hard? sharkpuncher?
[3:58:31] scarfdeath: The Great Boring push
[3:58:35] SultanGaming44: @warcraft you here?
[3:58:44] Sebleh: @praedari first boss too
[3:58:44] Sleepypan: @Shagran44 no drops atm
[3:58:45] EzzLyfe: @Praedari not the bosses but the trash
[3:58:47] abbutv1: @Praedari 1st boss kinda slaps
[3:58:49] PadreDenisovich: @Praedari bro on 31 fh even the yellows smack like a normal 20 mob :D
[3:58:51] Meeix: @Praedari the first one is already SUPER hard and then eudora also trucks
[3:58:54] Kelthiz: @Praedari Cuz it's fortified, trash
[3:59:00] Fluffin04: @Shagran44 ye whats up?
[3:59:01] Meeix: enforcers
[3:59:04] nyeusi_paka: @Praedari Eudora RNG
[3:59:04] Meeix: big yikers
[3:59:06] Fallenarch11: @SakhetEU  they cant prep it, the tournament realm is shut down after the day is over until  tommorrow evening when they start day2
[3:59:20] ozantus: kragg if any with his shots, but it's more likely to be a issue with the big pulls they ere doing on 29
[3:59:20] Moobot: Learn more about The Great Push! https://blizz.ly/TGP2023
[3:59:36] PadreDenisovich: @Fallenarch11 they had a lot of time on tournament realm before tgp even started tho
[3:59:38] beeweev: Does anybody know where DOA came from? I need an origin story
[3:59:45] ModeraYsera: @tibolt !gear
[3:59:45] Moobot: @tibolt Live gear: https://inspect.gcd.tv/
[3:59:49] SakhetEU: @Fallenarch11 I know, but they can plan out defensives etc better than winging it now
[3:59:55] SultanGaming44: @warcraft life-time subsection
[3:59:59] Bafox: is it 40min or 1h40min left?
[4:00:06] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @beeweev A stork delivered him to his parents as a baby
[4:00:10] nyeusi_paka: Which teams still have their second break to worry about, too?
[4:00:13] B3nbu: 1h40
[4:00:16] Praedari: maybe for 31 Fh they need a better tank class :wink: - time for a change?
[4:00:22] Meeix: teams generally prep 30s on TNMT before the event starts. they put tyrannical and fortified on their keys and push it as high as possible
[4:00:26] dethbybunnies: @Bafox 100min
[4:00:27] crazedorangutan1210: @Bafox 1:40 I believe
[4:00:31] Meeix: at least many do it like that, cant speak for all ofc
[4:00:35] beeweev: Lol but how did he make it to wow??
[4:00:44] ModeraYsera: @SUPER_MEGA_T_REX not just any stork, a MEGAStork with laser eyes and a photon cannon
[4:00:46] SakhetEU: 30 is not 31 though
[4:00:53] Sintry123: @Meeix I thought you were talking about the teenage mutant ninja turtles
[4:00:53] cendriii: hi
[4:01:09] Meeix: @SakhetEU i assure you they also prep 31s where possible haha
[4:01:13] Leonan1355: titan timmy
[4:01:14] Gaz_Games_: why is legendary not in the poll?
[4:01:15] shultsy: titan timmy
[4:01:18] Harnell: wait sodapoppin is playing?
[4:01:36] HappyLilPotato: @Harnell yes
[4:01:39] SultanGaming44: No
[4:01:43] Pakyqt: @Harnell nou
[4:01:44] LGhost: im pretty sure echo timed 31 FH in practice
[4:01:53] vroht: @harnell Yes
[4:02:04] dethbybunnies: sodapoppin playing for last minute no Kappa
[4:02:06] Kelthiz: @Harnell Soda is not sodapoppin
[4:02:07] SakhetEU: @Meeix I get that, but do you think they're as prepped for the 31 FH as they are for a 30 UR?
[4:02:09] Napknutt: why is good pve gear soo much harder to get than pvp gear
[4:02:27] Meeix: @Meeix ehh ,i would hope so :D
[4:02:54] dembro: o7
[4:02:55] th3blessed1: What is Echo cooking? 84 score?

[4:03:05] maulwurf90: KEKW
[4:03:09] Gaz_Games_: @Meeix poll fixed? Legendary getting a free pass to tomorrow? lol
[4:03:10] BobDaUnicorn: innervate maybe
[4:03:11] stepwowbro: What shes means is: If a DPS dies the team does less DPS overall.
[4:03:14] brotan123: also its easier to heal with only 3 alive
[4:03:18] Bloodbottler_88: What is this mana they are talking about?
[4:03:19] SMOrc0: That‚Äôs done
[4:03:26] Sleepypan: thanks for mansplaining it to us @gossamerwow
[4:03:28] Fallenarch11: @th3blessed1  they didnt start 4th key, they pushed all keys way higher than the rest
[4:03:28] Ellesmere_Gaming: They‚Äôre fine he can heal on super low mana for a long time
[4:03:39] Sintry123: JB spore boutta come from downtown
[4:03:46] Meeix: @Gaz_Games_ why are you @ ing me man i cant do anything about polls hahaha
[4:03:46] SakhetEU: Hmm maybe, even if they're evenly prepped, the 31 is a lot more volatile than the the 30 UR, which makes it less attractive in overtime no? Not being able to reset the key is the one problem of overtime
[4:03:52] BobDaUnicorn: kira has no innervate
[4:03:55] Bennodkk: Last minute out day 1 lul
[4:03:56] CallMeTOG: good thing 2 people died, 3 people require less mana to heal than 5
[4:03:57] shoeysean: Chadgoh about to take it home for NA
[4:04:03] brotan123: why are they fake dooming its free
[4:04:06] Gaz_Games_: @Gaz_Games_ but.buuut I heard you can do anything lol

[4:26:45] Sunaruqtx: @moth43 it gets energy by dmg taken. if it reaches 100% it spawns two adds that reduce its HP by 17,5% each. So if he reach 3x 100% Energy hes dead.
[4:26:47] moderatygos: thanks doa
[4:26:48] marcofellipe69: AlienDance
[4:26:49] Chr0nicConsumer: wtf two naguuras?
[4:26:52] JesuisLukas: Whats the point in doing a 24 when everyone knows these teams will do 27+ seems like a time filler

[4:26:59] Sebleh: Wait why is he welcoming Naguura again if she was already on the desk?

[4:27:13] moderatygos: we now have naguura and naguura casting
[4:27:14] seteleechete: well I am not sure about time tiebreaks. But if you go into a 29 infusion and fail it you can get into a tiebreak with them if you do 28 you just win over them(assuming everything else goes fine)
[4:27:15] Leonan1355: 4Head
[4:27:19] Bloodbottler_88: Which one is the real Meeix?

[4:29:33] susiaani: you don't want to randomly hear dungeon sounds during tgp? :D
[4:29:35] tbakm: I can't believe they are playing the best comp when playing for a prize pool of $300k!!! UNBELIEVABLE
[4:29:36] carllinyangy: the question should be why they dont have to
[4:29:37] Lorotard: @gabvosh then why are u watching

[4:30:33] Aneas: gg echi
[4:30:38] Snayderino: @Verruzan grats man, and you are right, you can time keys without the god comp, but the majority of players wanna copy this and MDI and it makes running m+ toxic for most
[4:30:41] Nofeerr: @seargentfish Fire has the best single target burst, while having massive aoe as well, i didnt say any other spec in the god comp is replaceable
[4:30:46] swelolclan: "its becuse the practise these classes, not becuse they are twice as good as rest of the classes" *promise"
[4:30:48] Matkingo03: i watch this only to see Echo win once again

[4:32:46] seteleechete: I think they will try 31 first
[4:33:07] Snayderino: you delete my message replying who cares to someone who is trying to troll by saying that
[4:33:07] B3nbu: me cares Kappa
[4:33:08] Sarinilol: i believe, they will run that 31 at the end of the day

[4:57:39] EzzLyfe: @flycory the frogs are scary tho
[4:57:40] Bloodbottler_88: @Yurian33 Probably because they can't hear DOA
[4:57:44] snevbunny73au: why do we see the same compositions all the time
[4:57:53] galdrelvolkfire: They are all using the exact same UI settings apparently

[4:59:01] DaBo00: @galdrel_volkfire the screens are from the tournament realm's built in spectator mode
[4:59:03] Censuras: @Matkingo03 Bears are more survivable/can handle bigger pulls. They only even consider warriors on tyrannical for spell reflect heavy bosses like Nelth's lair.
[4:59:04] NyIo: @Matkingo03 because patented no fun allowed blizzard technology

[4:59:53] raddz1: there are no more relevant compositions in the game?
[4:59:55] Quxiii: echo is pretty much safe
[4:59:57] galdrelvolkfire: Or self heals
[4:59:58] Emiliability: @Sathyron because they're not going to wipe in 27 halls
[5:00:03] torkim1351: @Sardaco i agree definitely

[5:04:00] Gamerhcp: @BeatlejuiceeHD its an item that starts a quest, if the RNG is on your side, you get it automatically upon killing sark
[5:04:09] raddz1: @Fluffin04  They will continue using the same composition throughout the tournament
[5:04:14] ozantus: i thought the key was capped at 35 and that was the only reason teams didn't push higher

[5:17:30] Tapes__: @windowlol can confirm

[5:18:05] Praedari: @SyriosOne I don't think the corsa conforms to the FIA regs does it?
[5:18:10] remaillla: as a solo player(pugplayer) it took me lots of time to reach 3k rio due to people not wanting warr and even if i do my key is russian roulete
[5:18:13] CeLouTw: @itsmeerebuss  20 21 keys need this teams
[5:18:17] Gamerhcp: @windowlol someone managed to do a cool world record today in BG3, 4 minutes from character creation to uh, romance with an npc
[5:18:23] damnation93: are these teams also the nerfed version, same as live servers?
[5:18:24] seteleechete: I think wipes matter a lot less since they can just restart into overtime

[5:18:28] windowlol: @Gamerhcp its lit
[5:18:35] Keagan_98: @traveler_103 indeed, last key needs to be started in 22 or so mins, so for them to finish the +29 before that seems unlikely
[5:18:36] frriiedd: @remaillla cuz you bring nothing for any affix ever
[5:18:42] Killer_hellfire: I would prefer a 437 mage than a 445 warr 3k rio
[5:18:42] DailyBread: @remaillla warrior doesnt bring much to the comp tho so its understandable
[5:18:48] itsmeerebuss: @CeLouTw no i have a rouge war and hunter doing 21s atm
[5:18:49] dmcstein: Idk most the time I inv off meta players and they do no damage so.....

[5:18:57] seteleechete: As long as it's not last minute/legendary that is but anyone doing 29 halls if they wipe they can just try again nothing lost
[5:19:02] Tapes__: idk title is effectively locked in unless they nerf dungeons so just gonna raidlog unless needed

[5:19:31] B3nbu: @moderatygos they are memeing kek
[5:19:34] Respls: @Sleepypan supper low ilvl
[5:19:50] remaillla: so im kind of obligated to pick meta class to get invited in keys. and progress thru high keys (cuz i like a challenge
[5:19:55] windowlol: mods just look over and randomly timeout someone without context LUL
[5:20:12] B3nbu: truu
[5:20:15] Sleepypan: I mean u asked and i answered @Respls
[5:20:15] x_Scy: remaillla if you want to do high keys, go look for a steady group

[5:37:56] Sunaruqtx: if NA's LAST HOPE wipes here and everyone else finish their key, they're out, no?
[5:38:03] Shearin77: let's goooo echo <3
[5:38:05] EzzLyfe: @ozantus they wouldnt have had time for any other key anyway
[5:38:26] juanmrbbnero: Can mandatory finish in time for another dungeon?
[5:38:30] Indoxio: its like peeing in your pants to stay warm
[5:38:35] ozantus: they had 29 mins, thats enough for a 30 fh maybe
[5:38:37] peempeck: !prices
[5:38:37] lojoci: why my stream lagging?
[5:38:43] Shearin77: @juanmrbbnero no
[5:38:43] negachinn21: The counter they have for dungeon progress... what addon is that. i prefer that style better than the blizz ui one
[5:38:43] Tarosath: the keys start so high... they have more time to progress
[5:38:43] Quxiii: @Sunaruqtx no they still win in time over mandatory
[5:38:44] galinhoo: @x_Scy they could fail or complete basically any other dungeon and still go halls LUL
[5:38:45] simoncs: @ozantus No
[5:38:46] Sebleh: plonk
[5:38:47] itsshad3: rat play
[5:39:02] bebincalicious: Lepan gonna go big at Lidl with them wins
[5:39:04] EzzLyfe: @ozantus keyword being maybe, it's a 30 min dungeon so it wouldve been rly tight
[5:39:05] frriiedd: SHOW DORKI
[5:39:05] x_Scy: @galinhoo IF they one shot. 29 VP has not been done, 30 FH and 30 UNDR are not 1 shot dungeons.
[5:39:05] Fallenarch11: highest key isnt on the screen, good production
[5:39:07] Juanzary: TBH Would really love every team to play all three days, since its the finals.. Actually so tight and a smal dc might ruin ur run Sadge
[5:39:10] Sizzlaa: heart2Cheerup
[5:39:11] Christgirl: I love the post nerf variety in the comps.
[5:39:13] specialmass: where can i see the prizes?

[5:39:26] marcofellipe69: PepePls
[5:39:27] Ladiplace: There is only 1 new dungeon to push tomorrow - the rest of the time will be spent maxing out your lower keys - loads of time
[5:39:28] Jicroas: thats a nice prizepool
[5:39:33] SirJonny1998: @negachinn21 its a weakaura i believe
[5:39:35] Traveler_103: is last time to start a key a hard limit?
[5:39:41] json_dotcom: how long till last run can be started?
[5:39:44] Nytrand: If na's last hope wipe they're out Kreygasm
[5:39:47] galinhoo: @x_Scy if they failed they could still do the 29 Halls
[5:40:03] ozantus: @EzzLyfe if they're not on for it then they bail and start 29 halls, idk, seems better to me than starting the 35 min dungeon with 29 min s left
[5:40:08] EzzLyfe: @traveler_103 there is a 1 minute grace period based on admin decision, if players have trouble loading in or something
[5:40:28] x_Scy: galinhoo and have less time to try for a clean start for a +2 when every other key is only a +1. doing the halls is 100% the play here
[5:40:37] WreckedSmok: mandatory is out no matter who wipe
[5:40:37] moderatygos: dungeons are LOCKED
[5:40:43] EzzLyfe: @ozantus their timer is 28:00, so they wouldve had only 28 for a 30 FH idk man
[5:40:50] Traveler_103: @traveler_103 thx
[5:40:52] nutwerthmaximus: personally i think they rotate the screens too much, makes it hard to track the teams, focus on highest keys and keep teams on the same panel or at least top / bot panel, the way its constantly rotating around is confusing.
[5:41:22] jedimind_lbc: why isnt the 30 up????
[5:41:22] Moobot: The Great Push Format Explainer: https://youtu.be/iSB2Oo5VIHE
[5:41:32] xDaruis: Why not more fullscreen time, so hard to follow 4 teams at once on a small screen
[5:41:33] glimmerywind: is there elimination today?
[5:41:33] Sebleh: seblehDinkdonk dungeons are locked
[5:41:34] ozantus: @EzzLyfe tight but possible with the option to call it off at any point in those 28 mins
[5:41:47] frelyah: @nutwerthmaximus they often dont even know what is going on with other teams then the 1 they are focusing on currently and swaps on intense moments
[5:41:48] Traveler_103: whats echo doing?
[5:41:50] x_Scy: @jedimind_lbc because the 30 is not the team that can be eliminated?
[5:41:53] eqi1: legendary goes to 114 not 115 though
[5:41:54] Nytrand: @glimmerywind yah
[5:41:55] Snayderino: @nutwerthmaximus what would be really great is i click on Perplexed and it goes big screen while the rest get minimized...let the consumer do it
[5:41:56] goonerboi21: echo is safe so no real to show them
[5:41:57] Fallenarch11: why isnt the 30 key on screen? 28 hoi is a joke
[5:41:59] jedimind_lbc: and no echo... lol no reason why the first place team doing a 30 isnt on screen
[5:42:06] Schali_WoW: That‚Äòs fine, more time to watch Echo üí™üèª
[5:42:10] quarkoffel: @glimmerywind Yes. Last team is out
[5:42:13] eternalfear: @traveler_103 winning by alot
[5:42:18] Snayderino: @goonerboi21 yeah but if people wanna watch echo they can
[5:42:19] EzzLyfe: @ozantus im not sure a 30 FH is doable in 28 min but we will see tomorrow probably
[5:42:23] galinhoo: @x_Scy Yeah, playing not to lose sounds like a possible argument, still really bad but fine
[5:42:28] DailyBread: junkrat vibes with the no comms
[5:42:38] Schaliiiiiiiii: why monkaW
[5:42:39] splattage: @jedimind_lbc Other than they are considered safe for today so the other's have more on the line?
[5:42:42] Quxiii: @DailyBread yea but junkrat is not the tank :D
[5:42:45] Razzinal: He's going Variance!

[5:43:11] glimmerywind: no more time
[5:43:12] moderatygos: THEY HAVE TO DO IT

[5:43:28] Azukalein: thanks
[5:43:32] nutwerthmaximus: yeh mandatory is out its honestly just poor production quality to not be focused on the 30 key

[5:43:56] TCGRebel: @nutwerthmaximus if you dont like it, you dont have to watch
[5:43:58] galinhoo: @x_Scy ?? your argument was that it was the best to not get eliminated while the other option could put them tied for first
[5:43:59] EzzLyfe: @nutwerthmaximus they are only out if perplexed time
[5:44:07] yoharald: ECHO
[5:44:18] eternalfear: what we really want is more meeix on screen
[5:44:30] flurr3baby: Moad gonna stay outside of last shield again
[5:44:34] nutwerthmaximus: thats the problem i like it but i dont like the low production quality that could be massively improved for ALL the viewers
[5:44:37] jedimind_lbc: ECHO
[5:44:46] x_Scy: @galinhoo no, the other option was them trying to time a 30 that is not going to be a one shot, then being forced to one shot the 29 hoi for +2 to be on equal footing for tomorrow
[5:44:52] EzzLyfe: Such a fast VP from Mandatory too
[5:44:52] Shearin77: what we really want is more cats on screen
[5:45:04] brotan123: mandatory timing last key at 00:04 what on earth are they doing lmao

[5:46:21] Aqunath69: Why is the sound from legendary suddenly so high? It's disrupting the commentary
[5:46:24] nutwerthmaximus: im prettu sure a large majority of people agree with the points i made about rotating screens being confusing, hard to track, and not giving off an overall enjoyable experience, especially for mobile or laptop viewers
[5:46:24] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/TGPS2_GlobalFinals

[5:46:39] Aqunath69: Turn down the sound lol

[6:08:49] cromo_so_max: this is MDI?
[6:08:49] dmcstein: @nocturne118 they are out cuz they had a 2 percent wipe on a 28 so that's not valid
[6:08:56] Jicroas: but in the finals a single mistake can be costly
[6:09:08] daddysanjii: Last minute tomorrow top 1 easy because nagura has gura in her name so polska gurom
[6:09:12] streetvillain: I completed a 2 chest +17FH gachiBASS
[6:09:15] Tannamagare: A shame that 1 wipe knocks you out. Think that mandatory has a higher skill ceiling than legendary and last minute
