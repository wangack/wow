[0:39:31] Sdeleon159: KAPOW
[0:40:19] Cowardpatty: I don't usually comment on people, but this guy went from wanting to be a mod to hoping Swifty loses?   What a nutjob.
[0:40:23] kajera: kajera subscribed with Prime. 
[0:40:23] StreamElements: kajera just subscribed PogChamp
[0:40:32] Galdrena: haha @Cowardpatty
[0:41:07] Cictani: if Swifty doesn't get hundereds or thousands of gold he  will have no chance unfortunately
[0:41:17] CHERNOWx: just a one question is there still gaming house ? :D
[0:41:30] Galdrena: i was going to time him out for 24 hrs if he started again but when he said he hopes Swifty loses was just mean. so BANNED :D lol
[0:41:34] Cowardpatty: Bad thing about working from home is when you have to do work instead of watching the Swifty stream.  Be back in a few...
[0:42:11] Dissuxx: How about mages that constantly sheep?
[0:42:25] Hyoox: its class spell
[0:42:29] Draero: do you think youll hit 60 before oct 30?
[0:42:30] hiraethonhs: so 60 seconds of inactivity at one time or combined?
[0:42:37] gamblingman33: point 3 is against mages
[0:42:43] Dissuxx: @Hyoox So is stealth
[0:43:10] Hyoox: stealth is bit different than stealth :)

[0:43:58] zeeenos: swifty youre a legend
[0:44:03] diarrheaplz: Can't hear you
[0:44:08] Dissuxx: He's on the phone
[0:44:11] AtomosTV: cant hear you
[0:44:15] Cictani: @JOD3N yep but not if you want to win this tournament xd
[0:44:18] diarrheaplz: Ohh
[0:44:21] diarrheaplz: My bad
[0:44:38] thegeneralmanager1: Mages could AOE them out of stealth
[0:44:46] surrealixx: Stealth doesn't guarantee it, plenty of spells can get them out
[0:44:48] hiraethonhs: that means u dont need to give rogue opener
[0:44:48] Cictani: but in some tournaments they wait for rogue or feral to get opener
[0:44:51] hiraethonhs: so u can spam aoe
[0:44:51] CheddarChopper: Seems like they cannot stealth before accepting the duel
[0:44:52] diarrheaplz: Play a shaman
[0:44:54] zeeenos: stealth detection
[0:44:54] gamblingman33: but you can get rogue out of stealth, no need to wait for him to open
[0:44:57] robohood: hunter could negate rogue so ez
[0:44:58] Hyoox: well theres big money on the line so rules must be strict
[0:45:01] p1oty: what is that for? hardcore pvp?
[0:45:02] Faultin: yah its not fair on warrior tbh
[0:45:03] NoTttttMeeE: Yeah Warriors going to get smacked in the face by a rope and you should know that these days
[0:45:06] Cictani: wl with fel hunter
[0:45:09] Cictani: human with racial
[0:45:09] Powahfull: Watching all these people using 60s to finish their mobs for them really removed the leveling aspect of the tournament
[0:45:13] motication: greater protection pots are going to make warriors god mode

[0:45:14] Spongeyguy: lucky demo roar could get them out lol
[0:45:22] Spart4nm4n: hi
[0:45:29] WeAreALLhuman: not allowed to move from the 20 yard range until target turns hostile = aoe rouge outta stealth instantly
[0:45:44] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:45:45] Faultin: yup 25

[0:45:54] PermaGrinnn: 8-25
[0:46:00] diarrheaplz: Engineering and rocket boots
[0:46:01] NoTttttMeeE: Going to be easy for you to get into a five man dungeon though with the warrior cuz everyone's playing Rogues
[0:46:01] kirbz09: dots arent instant damage. theres usually a delay?
[0:46:23] Hyoox: @kirbz09 still puts on combat
[0:46:25] diarrheaplz: Rogue
[0:46:32] kayeera: kayeera subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:46:32] StreamElements: kayeera just subscribed PogChamp

[0:47:18] Teagens: An ORC!? An ORC!?
[0:47:35] polkapolka69: Swifty. How about this spec to counter mages, locks and rogues?   ***
[0:47:39] TedAFK: @Swifty can you get into bgs  in HC? cause if u got carried u could get pvp gear :P
[0:47:45] motication: spellcasters have a massive disadvantage this turny. Greater protection pots are allowed, so you have a 1800-3200 absorb for what ever magic type u want, every 2 mins. Warriors/Rogues/Hunters are gonna be king this turny.
[0:47:45] SilkeySmooth: orc shadow priest
[0:47:56] Beirris: net trinket, nades
[0:48:02] diarrheaplz: Play a lock then lol

[0:48:18] SilkeySmooth: Orc shadow priest
[0:48:21] Hyoox: @motication those are macig buffs so priest and shaman example can purge em ?
[0:48:28] diarrheaplz: You don't have to play warrior don't feel pressured
[0:48:32] Cictani: @rambozog they don't let them get opener
[0:48:36] motication: @Hyoox noggenfogger them
[0:48:39] Powahfull: Warriors will have NO 2h weapon lol
[0:48:40] diarrheaplz: I'd say lock or rogue
[0:48:41] Beirris: call estfand about it :,)
[0:48:44] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso go.corsair.com/XYOjza
[0:48:45] SeanBon45: you can use  shadow protection pots, then use a rage pot,zerker rage to maintain

[0:51:22] Powahfull: If you do 40% DMG a 60 can finish the mob for full exp
[0:51:22] jokercowboysl: Feel like getting boosted by people should not be allowed
[0:51:32] thegeneralmanager1: You can have bank alts for sure

[2:52:41] hardtofin: cos you have 24 days to level right?
[2:52:52] Jaegermeistermaschine: It reads "only max level Chars will be claimed"

[2:56:02] stache007: #3 <---
[2:56:07] hardtofin: thats why reg is open for 24 days
[2:56:13] emzzemzz: might have to delete that char and redo the whole thing since you logged in and out several times
[2:56:16] pindog123: @hardtofin no you dont
[2:56:20] Kankki5: you have to log in

Long-term use of headphones may not cause dents, but it can cause permanent hearing loss. Experts say that headphones should be worn for 90 minutes maximum daily with the volume at 80%.

[10:51:24] supernerdcallme2fast4u: leveling guide would take an edge off imo
[10:51:30] chatisonfire: PepePls PepePls PepePls

[10:55:19] digitalpanhandlr: when you are more confident making a 19 point turn backing off a edge, then you are just going straight back...
[10:55:51] passtheflask: I wonder why the car couldnt reverse, probably broken
[10:56:00] chatisonfire: LUL
[10:56:18] Chaoschef: why not just go over the edge
[10:56:20] supernerdcallme2fast4u: @ptflask car was not broken the human was
[10:56:27] dekl0l: hes a god
[10:56:31] motication: @ironmouse34 there a couple of quests that take you very close to their path at his level.
[10:56:40] dekl0l: i mean he could have reversed right haha
[10:57:18] ironmouse34: @motication not at 12
[10:57:46] motication: @ironmouse34 yes, bro
[10:58:21] skullpileproductions: Swifty, will you win?
[10:58:33] ironmouse34: @motication I've been playing horde since 2005.... I know the Barrens quest very well and there's nothing that would bring him close to that patrol at lvl 12

[11:00:00] StargazerCRO: for mak gora?
[11:00:08] Goldbluma: oh warriors get overpower on dodge, got it
[11:00:27] motication: @ironmouse34 For example, the quest "The tagnant Oasis" from Tonga Runetotem takes you DANGEROUSLY close to their patrol path. Obtainable as early as level 10.

[11:00:46] motication: Tonga is in crossroads across the street from mankrik
[11:01:04] ironmouse34: @motication that sends you to TB and not once have I ever seen that patrol when I did that quest
[11:01:17] Diipindots: your not the only war man
[11:01:24] motication: @ironmouse34 it sends you to the lake southeast of crossroads.
[11:01:36] kattegutt: so a part of the tourney is that everyone lvl from 1-60 right before duels?
[11:01:45] witall1: gl swifty :D
[11:01:51] drudiaofthenightfall: Can't believe it
[11:02:24] ironmouse34: @motication yes you're right ... I was thinking of the mushroom quest ... but the Oasis line still doesn't go near that patrol
[11:02:36] motication: @ironmouse34 also, it doesnt send you to tb, at all.
[11:02:46] Possessedthunder1: I got the name thatguysfmg lol
[11:03:10] jonlovitzadmirer: hope u win swifty
[11:03:16] drudiaofthenightfall: 1 Small radiant shard 1 aquamarine 1 lesser nether essense
[11:03:23] motication: @ironmouse34 for someone that doesnt know the barrens it does. The odds are small, but if he drifts even a little bit from that area he would be in the patrol path, thats why i said DANGEROUSLY close.
[11:03:33] Scuba_: swiftyDEAL

[11:07:09] motication: @ironmouse34 even the qust you mentioned, i forget its name, but you get it very early on, after you do the first stage of its delivery. It takes you RIGHT THROUGH the pathing (the mushroom quest)
[11:07:11] Diipindots: you making it to 60?
