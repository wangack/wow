[1:19:54] reefo: LFM for guild with DKP loot system. You buy dkp with gold and at the end of the week the gold is split between members.
[1:20:00] AceOfFlame: GDKP meta becomes so inflated at 40 mans being such high ridiculous amount of gold, people already asking 150g+ in gdkps for lvl 25...its disgusting
[1:20:09] LoRswat: Guilds making a come back!!

[1:21:22] Seive_: Do you think this will get more enforcement than botting/gold buying?
[1:21:23] give_me_a_1_in_chat: Gonna keep it a buck like half my guild was buying gold in 2019 vanilla and gdkps weren't even a thing until like aq 40. It ain't going anywhere
[1:21:27] koshbur: @AceOfFlame i made my 400 gold from gdkps already, happy i managed to farm it before they banned it
[1:21:36] antisoul45: ahmpy sounded really butt hurt about it. pretty sure he sells gold for a living
[1:21:37] Emistry1: or do soft reserve runs :)
[1:21:44] Derezzed01: ist likely going to make the game better

[1:22:01] Fullmain: i hope so much this is sucsessful
[1:22:01] speedzombie: @antisoul45 his living is twitch subs. he gets 8k+ a month from subs
[1:22:02] AceOfFlame: @AceOfFlame That is why it needs to be banned....gear at p2...p3 etc will only increase ten fold from higher gold inflation and all sudden...it inflates economy
[1:22:10] Triggler: has gold price gone down?
[1:22:13] Joewrx: Black lotus DKP not allowed ?
[1:22:21] gryphsx: Kappa
[1:22:21] craboskai: @Joewrx what do you think
[1:22:23] gary_ontwitch: the only reason that might happen is because Blizzard sat on their hands the well is beyond poisoned now
[1:22:25] Fullmain: RMT, raidboosts, gdkp are just bad for the game
[1:22:28] exoLIVEWIRE: incoming Suicide Kings DKP system

[1:22:43] px_aaron32: people are just censoring the word GDKP lmao
[1:22:45] AceOfFlame: @AceOfFlame Like only people outside of gdkp getting 400g are like...locks having 3 accounts or mage carriers
[1:22:48] Genghjs: Yep.... They allowed a loophole
[1:22:49] antisoul45: @speedzombie twitch is most def not is main income. no one watched him before hardcore wow world first push
[1:22:59] koshbur: @Fullmain gold buying is bad for the game, without them i dont see how gdkp is a bad thing
[1:23:02] Crusar: If someone is buying gold to skip character progression, its clear that person does not fully enjoy playing the game, farming your gold and leveling normally is part of the game experience, which a huge amount of people seem to not understand

[1:23:59] AxelFromAustralia: banned
[1:24:01] reefo: gdkp is best loot system but it breeds gold buying so they need to give us the incentives for gdkp, but without the negative of gold buying. rolling for loot is bad system

[1:24:15] Lunchhbox_: the gold stays in your bags Madge
[1:24:25] give_me_a_1_in_chat: Rmt is going to go anywhere. People buy gold for variety of different things. Gdkp is only a symptom
[1:24:28] AxelFromAustralia: if you don’t shut down private deals, everyone will need roll and then sell at the end
[1:24:29] Buttsworth: at the very least a suspension

[1:24:53] DankWizard420: I'll believe it when I see it
[1:24:59] AceOfFlame: @give_me_a_1_in_chat Are you comparing people buying gold for 90g vs people buying gold that will be in the 1000s for gear the samething?
[1:24:59] Lunchhbox_: Their servers, they know what ur doing bud @madgarlicjr roflgatorSmile
[1:25:07] DankWizard420: @illskill where you do it doesnt matter it's the gold trade that matters
[1:25:10] aBradAbroad: PERMA

[1:25:35] give_me_a_1_in_chat: @aceofflame yeah because they buy the gold the next week for consumes or a mount or for an alt bro. It isn't going anywhere
[1:25:45] AceOfFlame: @give_me_a_1_in_chat Then your delusional
[1:25:48] madgarlicjr: im gonna test this and buy a grey item off someone for 1g and see what happens

[1:26:41] chestflow: it wont slow gold buying whatsoever

[1:29:24] Angeroth: @Angeroth Oh, I mean that's a lil grey area good point though.
[1:29:26] tekn4R: @madgarlicjr I don't think enough people realize that they don't have enough man power or "tech" to keep up with all these transactions. They already can't keep up with RMT
[1:29:27] reefo: can just make a guild and weekly tax of gold in guild bank, you loot with bid of dkp points you accumluate from the tax, you split the guild bank at the end of the week. so easy to exploit this is bad change with good intentions

[1:37:31] LoRswat: that guy stole my tag on that level 7 mob...I'm reporting him for GDKP
[1:37:36] exoLIVEWIRE: @StaysafeTV what's to stop them from introducing personalized loot into SoD?

[1:38:21] Randomguy_360: asmon is an idiot
[1:38:21] AlphaSimply: but also not in support KEKW
[1:38:21] MrCtrlAlt: I mean if they ban GDKP's because of RMT, do they ban AH, mailbox, trading, mounts etc aswell? where do they draw the line
[1:38:21] DuoX: asmongolds rich  and gets all his gear given for free by viewers
[1:38:22] dinghulberry: purely a contrarian
[1:38:23] fleesyo: it's a pretty L take
[1:38:26] koshbur: @reefo get gold ingame***

[1:39:07] cafrozed: shit was so smooth
[1:39:20] reefo: @koshbur i just want all the incentives of gdkp: if you want something you can get it without needing much luck, players will stay the whole time because they want their cut, if you dont get something u get gold. the only downside is ppl buying the gold. so fix it, dont ban it
[1:39:24] fart_boiii: asmongivemegold
[1:39:24] DankWizard420: asmon hasnt had a good take in like 4years now, unlucky Sadge
[1:39:34] AlphaSimply: they dont wanna be in a guild is all
[1:39:36] DuoX: false. If you play in a gdkp you are not a legit player
[1:39:36] sterlberl: watermelon moonshine? 😮‍💨
[1:39:37] AceOfFlame: @MrCtrlAlt Ah is no where near the same as GDKP when people actively bring in gold buyers to get their RMT gold legally...ah you have no control and most items like aka consumes that highest selling is not going for 100s of gold for gold buyers to want to buy gold
[1:39:37] Randomguy_360: asmon has literally never had good takes

[1:41:55] Wingsofjanitor: Well they've now changed the ToS so they ain't ToS followers anymore EZ
[1:41:58] alec_in_chains: even if Asmon doesn't buy gold, he certainly is given gold constantly
[1:41:59] AlphaSimply: xdd lack of tech
[1:42:02] SValchanov: can we increase asmons sound just a little
[1:42:06] nemo___x: microsoft lack of resource
[1:42:07] LoRswat: the good ole days....when they had the resources to do so
[1:42:16] Zerksyera: if they can shut down gdkp they can shut down the goldbuying
[1:42:18] reeesheep123: they should hire asmon to do it, he seems to have it all figured out
[1:42:21] timothyx000: they can
[1:42:22] eshonxv: saying "they follow tos" is a retarded take, because the tos just changed so it is  against tos now
[1:42:23] DankWizard420: dont forget blizzard takes a cut of most non sod gdkps
[1:42:24] Kewl__: BASEDCIGAR
[1:42:31] holdenwook: If Blizzard banned 100% of gold buyers (in classic or in retail), they wouldn't have a player base large enough to continue developing the game.
[1:42:35] nemo___x: they hire software developer from india to save money , but cant hire internet janny OMEGALUL
[1:42:36] ablib2: Except Blizz's #1 reason, it seems,(at least the 1st reason they gave) is it erodes community, guilds, etc.  Not because of gold buying.
[1:42:40] TurboBased: L OMEGALUL LBERTS
[1:42:42] Krtex: Banning GDKP is even harder. OMEGALUL
[1:42:42] dodgydad33: Easy for Asmon to say, he gets handed gold wherever he goes... hes upset hes now unable to pay people off for gear.
[1:42:48] naughtiemares: Wow tokens is buying gold
[1:42:51] timothyx000: there are a lot of assumptions bruh
[1:42:52] naughtiemares: They support it
[1:42:54] tekn4R: I mean pservers ACTUALLY banned players that bought gold, even though they were behind most of it.
[1:42:55] Angeroth: 2005 vanilla wow good times with Thottbot
[1:42:56] fake_based: treat the disease not the symptom
[1:42:57] timothyx000: chill out
[1:42:58] AceOfFlame: @Zerksyera Tons of people get suspended for gold buying, some others got banned for 1 month...a friend of friend of mine got perma banned for constant gold buying and also people who done gdkp got suspended for taking rmt gold
[1:43:00] koshbur: @naughtiemares just wait it will come
[1:43:08] DankWizard420: entire COPIUM
[1:43:08] madgarlicjr: i don't believe in gdkps personally but i think the player has the right to do them
[1:43:11] AlphaSimply: wow tokens inc to sod pepeLaugh
[1:43:12] Squintymonk31: it's also not the entire player base either
[1:43:17] Shredmuffn: gdkp'ers dont care about bots and gold selling tho
[1:43:17] AceOfFlame: @Zerksyera But they should obviously perma ban no slaps

[1:43:57] Kewl__: KEKL
[1:43:58] Krtex: And Blizz fucked up dungeon gold farming in Wotlk!!! sodaMad
[1:44:01] theboosh7: The fantasy land is a few minimum wage salaries away from reality so i think its resoanble to seek it
[1:44:04] Joewrx: WoW token is buying gold but more expensive
[1:44:07] pk99: buying tokens KEKW
[1:44:09] DankWizard420: blizzard gets a cut of gold buying via the token
[1:44:09] chazburner: how is it easier to ban gdkps than gold buying, though?
[1:44:10] WhoHazCake: they just get a cut of it
[1:44:13] timothyx000: they didn’t even ban soda so they are not trying to
[1:44:14] AceOfFlame: only thing wow token is different is not inflating economy
[1:44:22] jonv0: how do they shut them down
[1:44:27] DankWizard420: @AceOfFlame it 100% is
[1:44:30] Kewl__: @DankWizard420 thats why GDKP shitters can go and play non SoD and stop crying
[1:44:32] Crisis891: they will shut down until ppl stop playing then they bring it back cause they need money
[1:45:03] gary_ontwitch: ok but in a technical sense, if they can track and ban GDKP transaction, they should also be able to just track RMT transactions
[1:45:09] AceOfFlame: @DankWizard420 No it doesnt its impossible because its gold trading not gold buying, when you sell token... someone is trading you gold, your logic would be same as people use AH that inflates economy because people are trading items
[1:45:15] DankWizard420: @Kewl__ or yknow blizz could finally find the testicular fortitude and apply this to all versions of wow
[1:45:18] naughtiemares: I think that is reasonable
[1:45:40] LoneStar_LXXV: "Lets ban all Guns"....
[1:45:43] The_Immortan_Joe: hosting savoury deviate delight dkp pst
[1:45:45] koshbur: @AceOfFlame yea they should remove AH
[1:45:49] xsPVP: @StaysafeTV asmon is probably also buying gold so he has a bias
[1:45:56] lonzo_22: true staysafe tells no lies
[1:45:56] Spanos_: police in my town do nothing. makes sense.
[1:45:57] Kewl__: @DankWizard420 unimaginable, truth is they would love token in SoD, they just aware of community stance on it. Outrage would be phenomenal.
[1:45:58] DankWizard420: @AceOfFlame the items never interact with the cost of a token, it INFLATES the economy to it
[1:46:03] MrUntold: Gold buyer Probably: "Ugh now I have to make my own raid and Hard Res all the gear I want & need to parse a 38%"
[1:46:05] gary_ontwitch: @xsPVP KEKW ur not serious are you?

[1:46:10] rammd4wg: like at best buy
[1:46:12] AceOfFlame: @DankWizard420 Bots that sell gold is not meant to be in game...wow tokens difference is a real player had to farm that gold...only shit thing with wow token is sets a shitty system for carriers
[1:46:15] DankWizard420: @Kewl__ just wanna run 1 icc before cata Sadge gdkps everywhere
[1:46:15] sircrumpler: And you can never find an employee

[1:46:18] PoppaDEW15: I can’t stop shitting my pants that’s on me
[1:46:18] FriendmanBrother: Scholars need those underwear
[1:46:26] sneaksaway: ok i guess i have 1 question @StaysafeTV on the blue post they said they have many ways to see who is advertising and doing GDKP's.  How is that not usable to back track what all the gold seller accounts are?
[1:46:29] SValchanov: NotLikeThis

[1:47:01] timothyx000: like banning streamer buying gold

[1:49:01] JetGC: @AlphaSimply guess ill keep swiping YEP
[1:49:04] Zerksyera: we understand they arent but why arent they
[1:49:06] reeb69: blizz refuses to even address tickets with human responses.  they will never hire people to ban bots.  My buddy got banned for jumping on sticky walls and they wont unban him
[1:49:10] sneaksaway: Well i wonder how they have the ability to know who is doing GDKP and theis will be something they can easily implement but they cant you those same things to back track where the gold came from and perform bans
[1:49:10] snoopychair: !whatif

[1:49:22] Vehicle_King: Bots pay $15 or w/e the Venezuelan rate is too! So why would Blizzard ban paying customers
[1:49:29] Dreako00: Calm down buddy. They can do a better job with the bots, but it's not worth the costs
[1:49:31] DankWizard420: to be fair blizzard only trying to shut down gdkps in a version of wow they dont have a token is really funny KEKW
[1:49:33] iron3308: Why blizzard is able to have "detecting method" for GDKPs and not for RMT? @StaysafeTV

[1:55:57] SValchanov: YEP

[1:56:01] TheDeadPixel93: it will recover
[1:56:02] sargent_baddy: imagine caring about the economy of a game
[1:56:06] AlphaSimply: it is, bots will make sure they are
[1:56:12] erawin1990: thank god
[1:56:12] AtomicHydraa: atomic363Soniic atomic363Soniic
[1:56:13] longsfellow1200: ZATTAAA
[1:56:15] CerealKiller_HS_: I’m happy as well but how well will they be able to control gdkps? they can’t event control bots nor gold buying @staysafetv
[1:56:29] craboskai: gold buyer spotted
[1:56:30] AlphaSimply: i mean TRUEING
[1:56:31] erawin1990: cause gdkps and bots go hand in  hand
[1:56:31] AtomicHydraa: new bot system apparently

[1:56:32] Vehicle_King: Hes so close
[1:56:32] erawin1990: wtf
[1:56:34] sneaksaway: lol we start getting GDKP nad Non GDKP servers like we get PVP and PVE
[1:56:36] tylerificus: Clueless
[1:56:38] Boo116: LUL
[1:56:39] AlphaSimply: Surely
[1:56:39] reefo: they have never tried banning bots
[1:56:44] Krtex: Players will only be alowed to function in SSF mode! PogChamp
[1:56:52] suddenarthritis4: Prayge the new tech AI bot will crush the bots
[1:56:54] erawin1990: i bet a bot typed that post

[1:56:57] LegendFromWoW: that’s an interesting theory
[1:57:01] ablib2: lol
[1:57:02] Vehicle_King: Should SOD have started as SSF to experiment?
[1:57:02] AtomicHydraa: they blue posted about a new technology thats targeting bots more efectivly
[1:57:04] hiniku_hyena_martyr: They never thought of it
[1:57:14] DankWizard420: blizzard hasnt accepted there are no bots so they dont have to deal with it, typical head in sand behaviour YEP
[1:57:16] suddenarthritis4: classic era Aware
[1:57:18] Valsu: why is it that we have to give up on them doing the most common sense logical thing
[1:57:20] TurboBased: YEP

[1:57:45] sargent_baddy: prices will go up not down
[1:57:47] DankWizard420: @Vehicle_King the game needs alot of changes for that it's not like runescape
[1:57:57] PatchesMcPatch: Its actually the opposite. consume prices will go up cause the supply will drop
[1:57:58] thepinga: people are still gonna buy gold for consuems
[1:57:59] Kewl__: yes gold will become more valuable in theory
[1:58:01] MrHuntMeDown: no.
[1:58:03] AtomicHydraa: gdkps incentivize gold buying 100%
[1:58:06] chazburner: that's not always good for very casual players. inflated prices also make it easier to make gold
[1:58:09] jodihighrolly: But it’s still inflated, if the item I’m grinding for is out of my budget 200 or 400 it’s still gunna be unobtainable through grinding
[1:58:11] craboskai: WE GOT ONE pepeLaugh
[1:58:14] fake_based: bots drive down the cost of consumes

[3:23:01] sircrumpler: Fucking hate rogues as a lock
[3:23:07] kingpincognito: I'm glad you all are having fun with SoD, but this is sounding more and more like retail without the cataclysm or updated character models. So many of the rune abilities and stuff are directly from live.
[3:23:08] NotDessx: lmao
[3:23:15] corsair714: I have no issues with rogue on my lock lol
[3:23:22] ardice1: rogues are going to be every classes HARD counter at 40.
[3:23:23] corsair714: Meta and drainlife = i win

[3:23:33] swimmingbird21: how accurate do you think the datamine will be?
[3:23:37] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @kingpincognito updated character models ruined the game
[3:23:43] mysteriousm4n: lock is solid A-B tier
[3:23:46] fake_based: it wont break top 3 dps
[3:23:49] linkitcraig: WCB on crack for melee
[3:23:56] Udenwo: can't wait until 50 when Warlock DOTS can crit, and I get unstable affliction
[3:24:02] Nirha: perma lust
[3:24:03] Aiden92: the new pala buff time for 10 min is a joke
[3:24:07] kingpincognito: Like Retail- instead of Classic+.
[3:24:12] speedzombie: It's like 100 attack power
[3:24:15] iamharmor: AP
[3:24:18] rocknsake: def AP
[3:24:18] mysteriousm4n: AP
[3:24:18] bots_bots: its speed
[3:24:19] linkitcraig: melee/ranged attack speed to me
[3:24:20] divadnothsa: power is more balanced
[3:24:21] Kewl__: @StaysafeTV have you checked runes, they datamined all
[3:24:22] LoopeRtronn: melee range and movement by 20%
[3:24:23] jameserush1: speed
[3:24:25] Nirha: oh it is AP
[3:24:25] erawin1990: 20% haste bro
[3:24:26] Sunderwire_: increases haste for sure
[3:24:28] agentlank: all speed
[3:24:30] fake_based: that still massive
[3:24:33] linkitcraig: it doesnt say attack power?
[3:24:34] agentlank: it doesn't say Attack Power
[3:24:34] sound_wayv: i feel like trap launcher is gonna be bonkers
[3:24:36] Bobka: 20% haste is broken
[3:24:37] cockjab: no way its 20% haste lmao
[3:24:40] sneaksaway: it is all speed
[3:24:41] MrPink604: badly written but implies speed
[3:24:43] tenwick: attack power and movement speed
[3:24:45] cockjab: 20% haste would be insane
[3:24:46] agentlank: Yes, speed, they dont' say power
[3:24:49] rocknsake: i guess ironforge is the new hangout
[3:24:53] ottonistaken: it's a mis-datamined tooltip, the attack power value has been left off
[3:24:55] iamharmor: we see melee are super dominant, lets give them rend buff on steroids
[3:24:55] bots_bots: ranged x melee x and movement x
[3:24:59] bots_bots: x =  speed
[3:25:00] MaxMx__: no shot we get 20% haste
[3:25:03] MaxMx__: if so DAMN
[3:25:03] Muaytitus: its all haste, phys get no atk power
[3:25:04] CygnusC: it would say power otherwise
[3:25:04] oasis604: godtier
[3:25:04] vejitas4: @staysafetv nah dude i will just cheap shot if ou use trinket kidney shot right away amd you wait for kidney shot to trinket out i will just vanish cheap shot then you will stay stunt lock
[3:25:05] TheBarehand: prob just a type
[3:25:07] linkitcraig: WCB is 15% haste
[3:25:07] longsfellow1200: that is insane
[3:25:08] TheBarehand: typo
[3:25:11] Mattysaiyan: attack speed imo
[3:25:16] windatar: Casters get 4% crit melee/range get 20% haste.
[3:25:20] erawin1990: can we stack this with BFD boon?
[3:25:20] Cenarios13: no hit rating for casters Sadge
[3:25:21] kheeefy: What is the scaling for lvl 60 gonna be like holy
[3:25:21] erawin1990: or no?
[3:25:28] sparebanana: fire mage is gonna insane
[3:25:30] AlphaSimply: watch everything be different
[3:25:30] Udenwo: 4% crit and 42 spell dmg is crazy, no way that stays
[3:25:33] Bobka: Do you think bosses in Gnomer will be not affected by Bleeds or Poison ? This is a major nerf for melee ( warrior rogues )
[3:25:34] 903gaming: poisons
[3:25:34] Arcsilin: that in pvp will be insane
[3:25:34] Shiaco: enhance shamans are getting crit chance
[3:25:34] bots_bots: mage gonna be insane
[3:25:34] warrndu: rogue envenom?
[3:25:34] oasis604: makes sense at casters lower on dps scales
[3:25:37] agentlank: haste is king anyways
[3:25:38] MaxMx__: exorcism crits POG
[3:25:39] fake_based: melee doesnt need it, its classic melee will be king
[3:25:39] rocknsake: i bet the tooltip is wrong from the datamine
[3:25:40] Krabue: spellhance enjoyers
[3:25:45] AlphaSimply: that is nuts tho 4% and 42 sp
[3:25:45] longsfellow1200: casters get huge buff
[3:25:45] Mattysaiyan: Enhance eating good with double dip
[3:25:48] MoonZTi: melee fast, caster stronk
[3:25:49] broccoliost: much more
[3:25:50] bots_bots: no Hit for casters
[3:25:50] RatmanForever: ENHANCEMENT AND RET THO
[3:25:54] heygoditsme: for sure
[3:26:00] windatar: 42 spell power and 4% crit is nuts for mages though.
[3:26:00] MoonZTi: it should be 10% haste not 20%
[3:26:07] ottonistaken: it's a mis-datamined tooltip, the attack power value has been left off
[3:26:10] bots_bots: theres a lot of hit on gear
[3:26:15] cockjab: most casters get hit from talents and gear
[3:26:16] Mattysaiyan: We lose the oil too I think
[3:26:18] Mattysaiyan: so it will be
[3:26:19] gary_ontwitch: @StaysafeTV look at mage tuning, did they just kill boosting meta?
[3:26:20] erawin1990: will this stack with boon?
[3:26:22] speedzombie: That's cuz they get hit from oil and boon
[3:26:24] Bobka: If you cant bleed bosses or poison them , Feral / Warrior / Rogue are nerfed
[3:26:33] AlphaSimply: what if they are trolling
[3:26:33] deywa7: u also have had 3% spell hit tho
[3:26:35] alf_hd: @erawin1990 no

[3:28:26] CygnusC: maybe final phase without a suit
[3:28:33] erawin1990: they might not be typed as mechs
[3:28:34] ardice1: 4 = could be 25% health swaps
[3:28:36] erawin1990: u never know
