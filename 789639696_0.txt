[2:03:44] SaltySandman__: They can do the timewalking stuff?
[2:03:47] Archiduss: Is there a reason I don't see a single add on twitch ever? I have amazon prime and live in The Netherlands (EU)? But I only pay 2,99 EUR a month for Dutch amazon prime lol...
[2:03:47] JonnyScotland: Amazon turbo still a thing?
[2:03:51] coachingpotatoes: well, i can't queue any other dungeons than bfa either. i'm not new player
[2:03:51] Evilbreed83: remember tivo
[2:03:52] Darkice997: Shaman has no brez except the totem
[2:03:55] Aquadriel: like, i dont mind ads, i understand why they do it.. But i hate the message "streamer is taking a break, so watch an add" when the streamer is actually doing something cool on stream. thats BS. @Towelliee
[2:03:55] TacticalKabuki: Gotta pay for all the BIG ticket streamers like Toweliee XD

[2:04:11] coachingpotatoes: chrome be newbie racist
[2:04:12] DeanoTV: if she is brand new u can only do bfa
[2:04:12] Goregan: Batlle is ready towHype
[2:04:15] Roren091: turbo will be a bad thing for streamers
[2:04:18] WoW_StandalonE: I have not seen a single ad in Twitch and I'm not sub to anyone lol
[2:04:24] Djulio: I'm only getting amazon prime video ads - earlier it was non-stop Vikings ads and now it's The Boys, all of which I've seen already............
[2:04:24] Ertra: @Darksider2008 first time leveling? you have to do BFA once
[2:04:28] tulifau_: @coachingpotatoes go to Chromie and select a different expansion then you’ll be able to que those dungeons.
[2:04:29] psyranx: STREAMLINK = NO ADS
[2:04:35] Eastwicksavag3: so many ads about politics
[2:04:37] Darksider2008: So she has to do all of bfa ?
[2:04:38] Nesrath: Heck no
[2:04:40] HiphopBlingJesus: I was doing some cata dungeons yesterday for leveling and there are a lot that one/two shot tanks and definitely need tuning
[2:04:45] MetallicusGaming: Darksider2008 yes

[2:05:06] KristineTheUnicorn: Sublife is nice PrideWave
[2:05:07] Rekoor: what are ads? KappaHD
[2:05:08] m4zz09281: the pip commercials do make it an easier pill to swallow
[2:05:12] coachingpotatoes: @tulifau_, ty. i wonder why they needed to make it like so though
[2:05:13] iAlwaysSin: i dont mind ads tbh, but why do they have to be so fucking loud
[2:05:15] MILESkg21: whats an ad KappaHD
[2:05:16] Olgit: I've paid to have watch.... I don't need no stinking ad's.
[2:05:18] yunggluten: I just got turbo. I watch too many different streamers to feasibly sub to them all.
[2:05:25] Archiduss: Its so weird... I haven't had a single Twitch add in months. Not even when I start someone's stream... Its been completely ad free for me. And im only paying 3 euros a month for amazin prime lol... I feel so cheap. xD
[2:05:31] MrGattz: towelliee heal me
[2:05:42] Riggoz1: since im a sub, I won't get ads right?
[2:05:46] MrGattz: for the next boss fight
[2:05:49] intrepid003: ads? turbo KappaHD
[2:05:53] JonnyScotland: the issue is streaming is kind of bad if random ads happen, You miss important things. Imagine missing your guilds first kill on a final boss for example
[2:06:01] playmistakecody: is this Dungeon music or some diablo style stuff in the background?
[2:06:03] Riggoz1: Riggoz1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 14 month streak! :)
[2:06:03] Moobot: @RIGGOZ1 with the 17 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[2:06:09] tulifau_: Yeah @coachingpotatoes its kind of scuffed but I understand that’s how they control you going in to separate the different expansions since they aren’t level throttled anymore.
[2:06:12] Herzenliegen: Morning @Towelliee and chat. Woke up to the first snow on the ground today. :(
[2:06:16] Roren091: turbo doesnt benefit the streamr right?
[2:06:26] KingSlayerYotam: all the add fiasco makes turbo more worth it, twitch should really renovate the turbo sub
[2:06:34] DrKushTV: tfueHIGH nickmercsVIBES tfueHIGH
[2:06:39] UmbraChimera: What's project 50?
[2:06:40] coachingpotatoes: @tulifau_, yeah, but it's impossible to even know that without being some wowhead/mmochampion reader
[2:06:55] Ertra: @UmbraChimera 50 level 50 characters
[2:07:00] intrepid003: turbo counts the ads as if we viewed it iirc
[2:07:02] Roren091: @KingSlayerYotam will people be willing to sub to people then though?, i feel like it will make twitch more money than the streamers
[2:07:09] Rexialiton: Good morning @Towelliee and chat <3
[2:07:14] tulifau_: @coachingpotatoes yeah there could be a better way to tell the players
[2:07:29] AveragePvp: 6 again? F u Twitch wtf
[2:07:31] tulifau_: @herzenliegen yuck, no thanks on that stuff. Had enough snow for my life lol.
[2:07:32] Kinghorn: it is ublock
[2:07:35] grizzlyhorn: twitch gets the money for turbo sub and you get the money for the ads that we dont see
[2:07:38] Kinghorn: some cookie issue
[2:07:46] magemaster225: its an adblock arms race
[2:07:48] Exodeo_: I just subbed to cancel the adds lol, you're well worth the support anyway :)
[2:07:49] fullryuga: Battle ready
[2:07:52] Olgit: lol - Asmongold was like - " It isn't me... here let me show you. " He then showed people who couldn't actually see him do it because they were in an advert. lol
[2:07:53] djvolty: glad i give towelliee 5 bucks for no ads

[2:08:26] netblackfire: only in a game it's okay to tell someone to kill themselves lol
[2:08:28] KingSlayerYotam: @rorehn I had to sub to asmon,every time he was about to loot something I got an add, and raged subbed. so I guess it happening to other people too
[2:08:39] coachingpotatoes: @futomara01, nah 1 is enough. twitch is just trying to race them right now. they'll give up soon enough
[2:08:53] duffluv22: HOW BOUT THEM STEELERS!!!!!! MORNING!!!!

[2:09:24] Kriven: Joe Burrow is the man
[2:09:26] psyranx: @rorehn are you a sub?
[2:09:29] onacouch: I remember when I first played I thought ghostwolf was stealth, and that my human perception was what allowed me to see it.
[2:09:32] SerFloyd: yeah Burrow might be legit
[2:09:34] magemaster225: titans are cursed team this year, tannehill is bad juju

[2:28:07] QueeenOfCups: if you read the FAQ it does talk about the caffeine content and not recommend more than one can a day but the powder says equivalent to a large coffee and just be mindful of how much you have a day
[2:28:22] iroyal2: energy drinks are op ice cold wtff
[2:28:29] DeuceDempsey: water gotta be cold

[3:06:11] Amarlian: @Motivess not really, you just play the same story over and over again to level @Motivess
[3:06:16] reiversa: What is your plan for day 1 of SL? Pushing pala to 60 and doing dungeons?

[3:07:24] Dustwellow: stormkeeper!
[3:07:25] Cerbrus0: Alliance in general sucks, most of the hardocre players are horde because our racials are op, the only time alliance is good is for mdi, awc and for world first max lvl because you 30% bonus xp from war mode
[3:07:26] iamWaritself: Good morning Towelliee and chat =)
[3:07:29] mrelgaato: *arms

[3:08:22] Amarlian: @Motivess and FFXIV is a lot more story based. I have played since release of WOW so it's not new stories. I like both games and I do understand that they are different but there are very easy ways to level a different job if you want. just a different philosophy
[3:08:26] mo197: bye Felisha
[3:08:28] DeadlyDag: Incorrect @Cerbrus0 It used to be like that, but it's not. If you go to wowhead and compare, it's actually alliance that got the best racials (especially passives) to make that extra dps for the elitists. People are horde because the majority of players are due to how it used to be, so its easier to get new people to be hardcore.
[3:08:32] GhostsWasteland: h
[3:08:37] DeuceDempsey: The Originals quest is awesome
[3:08:40] KingsandClubs: You can just craft them

[3:08:46] reiversa: 1 xp for ding :D
[3:08:47] Dazart99: why send heirlooms? just recreate them?
[3:08:54] Psyphin808: ^
[3:08:55] epster: no need to send heirlooms - just recreate
[3:08:56] Soyeahbrah: you dont need to send heirlooms? all characters have them unlocked no?
[3:08:56] Drakenking: Horde racials are not OP Lmao
[3:08:58] Grunton: they are not tho
[3:09:07] DeadlyDag: Buffs / enchants @Dazart99
[3:09:07] SquupSTV: @Towelliee Can't you just simply recreate them on all you Chars regarding the heirlooms?
[3:09:13] JimtheSFN: Dazart99 because he has enchants and gems on them
[3:09:13] MetallicusGaming: Soyeahbrah yh but they're enchanted
[3:09:14] fewyn: KEKW

[3:09:34] Strouss: not according to all of the big name websites.
[3:09:35] FischBowlGaming: I don't remember the last time I had to send heirlooms to any of my toons. They sit in my collection on every toon.
[3:09:39] Awwshifty: @Towelliee Are you raiding for Shadowlands? If so with who?
[3:09:40] hectabit: wow you are only 1 exp away from leveling?
[3:09:45] steldam: just craft them again....
[3:09:45] Merkuriuz: why do you send heirlooms ?
[3:09:48] Amarlian: the story is great in ffxiv but also there are some key Anime tropes in there for sure @H3LLON3ARTH
[3:09:48] Strouss: imo shadowmeld is the best lol
[3:09:50] Psyphin808: just remake them
[3:09:58] MILESkg21: just remake LUL
[3:10:01] spidyor: wat ur character
[3:10:02] BlackRhino: why is he mailing heirlooms instead of generating ones?
[3:10:02] Dazart99: don't mail heirlooms.
[3:10:03] RaidbossTV: LUL
[3:10:04] Firelordxsrx: Are heirlooms still worth it?
[3:10:06] gnated: Are you mailing heirlooms cause they have enchants on them ?

[3:10:15] Mecabeast: dont forget dmf buff for an extra 10%
[3:10:15] Strouss: Horde has better racials for pvp alliance is better for pve imo
[3:10:16] KontrolStyle: heirlooms still work it yets
[3:10:18] KontrolStyle: yes*
[3:10:19] Dazart99: ah
[3:10:20] oticai: @Drakenking Maybe not anymore, but they must have been at one point, how else to explain excess Horde in hardcore raiding?
[3:10:21] Kromede: chat pls NotLikeThis
[3:10:21] maardal: enchants and gems

[3:38:35] maardal: SL releases a day before my first exam, not excited about that
[3:38:49] Huffthegreat: @towelliee where’s diablo 4 though ?!?

[3:39:17] CreadyDaGoat: there is no way lmao
[3:39:26] S1appadabass: no way it gets delayed again
[3:39:28] BRUTALIT0PS: No, they are too committed to the release now
[3:39:29] CreadyDaGoat: no way they got a free pass and they still mess it up
[3:39:39] Dopenose: They wont delay further
[3:39:39] mo197: best way to learn though
[3:39:47] Dopenose: it will just suck
[3:39:49] Thunderbrew: @Towelliee You said there are just a few things to fix, otherwise it functional. I'm sure there is no delays now.
[3:39:49] Alienfromger: 3 weeks is almost no delay tho :P
[3:39:51] Dopenose: And they wont care
[3:39:51] Polysac: They should delay it to release around christmas so raid is out after new years.
[3:39:55] EndgameInc: no way they delay again, think how bad that would look for them
[3:39:55] Spathotan: Yea, I dont give two shits about Cyberpunk getting delayed. Ive got other stuff to play
[3:39:56] BRUTALIT0PS: It was a good thing they did delay, but I doubt they do it again
[3:39:58] PinkBasketball: i can't figure out what class i want to level. any suggestions?
[3:39:59] Aidler: this year will go down into history as the delayed year.....
[3:40:07] SpookBoio: I think it would be too bad for blizz if they delayed it AGAIN
[3:40:09] vintersorgSA: If the healer is like sub 20 or something they prob got no spells to keep up haha
[3:40:11] primetimezhilex: guys is that korrak revenge good for leveling?
[3:40:12] terribalgamer: im so glad they got rid of the stuns and disarms on regulars mobs
[3:40:14] irlock143: @Towelliee i wonder how bad launch week will be
[3:40:23] AmorGD: What talent u take on lvl 40 row as a prot warr? @Towelliee ?
[3:40:30] Technogre: I'm gunna miss the first week of expansion now
[3:40:30] Thunderbrew: @PinkBasketball Frost Mage or Warlock is fun for ranged.
[3:40:38] Polysac: Stop releasing raids during christmas.. delay it with 2 weeks so the raid is out after new years.
[3:40:46] ArcaneSyntax: lol classic
[3:40:55] PinkBasketball: @Thunderbrew i've already leveled both of those. I can't really decide between hunter or paladin
[3:40:57] Mr_Pennywise_: towHi HELLO ALL towHi
[3:41:02] NILLme: 100% it was a corporate decision to release everything this year
[3:41:05] EndgameInc: yeah agree with that
[3:41:07] identityuknwn: whats project 50?
[3:41:08] radiorahem: Ya that’s bad why release Nax and BC rn
[3:41:09] ArcaneSyntax: naxx will be cleared in like an hour and then back to retail.
[3:41:10] getkt: hi
[3:41:12] getkt: my bro
[3:41:18] Thunderbrew: @PinkBasketball Personally I love Hunter. BM is my catJAM
[3:41:21] icemanj99: Going to be weird with the expansion release being the week of Thanksgiving in the US.
[3:41:42] S1appadabass: They are keeping Classic on its original timeline while SL got delayed, so its all being released at the same time now
[3:41:50] radiorahem: Xp buff is gone right ?
[3:41:57] PinkBasketball: @Thunderbrew i'll give hunter a try. hopefully i enjoy it
[3:42:00] Motivess: @arcanesyntax have you ever done Naxx?
[3:42:14] S1appadabass: S1appadabass subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[3:42:15] Moobot: @S1APPADABASS with the 39 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[3:42:32] Thunderbrew: @Towelliee do you think it's possible in Shadowlands to main a tank and healer for raids?
[3:42:33] Huffthegreat: @arcanesyntax yeah right pffft
[3:42:40] ArcaneSyntax: @motivess nope, but classic raids have been cleared by naked characters, this shit aint hard.
[3:42:56] Huffthegreat: It’s hard
[3:43:00] nebul0rd: whats a good game to play in shadowlands meantime? im burnt out. i dont like fps's anyone know one?
[3:43:13] Steadmoh190: how come you are trying to level 50/50 characters? @Towelliee
[3:43:20] Eloquenza: can you still farm the jeeves recipe in storm peaks?
[3:43:24] Motivess: @arcanesyntax it is not possible to do it in a hour, no matter how fast you kill the bosses
[3:43:24] lel3owski: duh, it was never going to have the same prestige
[3:43:35] Alienfromger: 1 day hype
[3:43:35] JamesWaudby: They'd be right as well
[3:43:37] Amerra: are daggers not considered one handed melee weapons?
[3:43:39] Huffthegreat: @wreckin_rhino play Rimworld
[3:43:49] MainmiseWL: im getting our first atiesh i cant wait :)
[3:43:50] crawcook: Would everyone clear it though that quickly? What about casuals?
[3:43:51] vintersorgSA: It's already been solved. It's like being proud of beating Super Metroid.
[3:43:56] Malindan: Just another tuesday
[3:43:56] EndgameInc: it's still silly that they put it on PTR hoenstly, that would have helped 'preserve' some of the allure of naxx - end result would be the same, but still
[3:44:03] HotHotHeals: CoachCamoCarry subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! gimmie dat 26% xp bonus baby
[3:44:03] Moobot: Thanks @COACHCAMOCARRY for subbing for 5 months! towHAMUP
[3:44:06] Drakenking: Damn their 1 raid day might be ruined or delayed
[3:44:07] EclipseDTP: @Towelliee Ok...Avengers Shield, Grand Crusader, and First Avenger are so GOD TIER....
[3:44:17] nebul0rd: @Huffthegreat never tried a game like that, ill check it out!
[3:44:22] Drakenking: I bet they could still clear with 31
[3:44:34] randolphrs: What UI addon do you use?
[3:44:36] Bogzeh: so what happens after naxx? tbc isnt confirmed right?
[3:44:41] DennisTried: real men play male belf

[3:44:45] Huffthegreat: @wreckin_rhino it’s really fun just a little learning curve
[3:44:50] BRUTALIT0PS: So dungeons are still the fast way to level?
[3:44:54] randolphrs: Oh thank you @real_pudge
[3:45:04] Snabido: Who's ass? Kappa
[3:45:09] jontrann: black mor ass?
[3:45:12] crawcook: At the end it was probably pressure to release everything this year.
[3:45:19] laughing_octopus: whats the exp pot?
[3:45:22] BRUTALIT0PS: Oh gosh, I forget about Black Morass
[3:45:22] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[3:45:29] Steadmoh190: wasnt the point to keep it just classic wow?
[3:45:35] mo197: jinx
[3:45:48] Amerra: cheer10 are daggers not considered a one handed melee weapon? It's not letting me use my dispatch on my rogue
[3:45:50] Drakenking: @Towelliee do you think they will still do a physical blizzcon normal time next year assuming we have a vaccine or something by that time with Blizzconline being in february
[3:46:00] Thunderbrew: Is there a fast way to the Horde Darkmoon Faire?
[3:46:01] maardal: @laughing_octopus think it is the BFA one you buy for those honor medals?
[3:46:19] maximusjr: @towelliee how come your leveling so many characters?
[3:46:22] HotHotHeals: yeah usually only hits 2 now
[3:46:23] Mogwaimonk: target capped i think
[3:46:33] jontrann: @Towelliee does warrior tanking feel better post prepatch?
[3:46:34] crawcook: I have this feeling they will keep it as Classic. BC will be a separate "product".
[3:46:34] ArcaneSyntax: yeah 5 i think?
[3:46:35] mo197: I love the cow jump
[3:46:37] Ortinoth: target cap
[3:46:43] MOLAR305: soft cap
[3:46:45] Fatpally: rest of dungeon people: i swear there was mobs in here o nvm its just cowelliee mowing them all over
[3:46:50] Huffthegreat: BC so good tho
[3:47:02] HotHotHeals: dragon roar and slam are the only aoe for warrior that snags threat
[3:47:03] Amerra: are daggers not considered a one handed melee weapon? It's not letting me use my dispatch on my rogue
[3:47:15] ZyntosAran: @Amerra it does not work with a dagger in main hand
[3:47:26] Amerra: gottcha!
[3:47:27] ArcaneSyntax: @amerra outlaw doesnt use daggers
[3:47:30] Artivicii: BC was life
[3:47:53] radiorahem: I don’t like the BC armor sets
[3:47:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[3:47:57] Stradivarii: BC was great, but even then we had people longing for the classic days :P Kind of asking myself the same question as @rin5486
[3:48:03] radiorahem: But the weapons Kreygasm
[3:48:06] Aidler: BC was great but don't get lost in nostalgia again
[3:48:16] Drakenking: @Amerra you cant use daggers in your mainhand as outlaw
[3:48:21] EfnetLemons: I wqnt WoD Classic!

[3:48:25] vintersorgSA: remember attunements? lol tbc was a step up above vanilla but still was horrible
[3:48:27] CipansR_Ayaya: sounds good to me
[3:48:30] Blitzylive: you mean no WOD CLASSIC?
[3:48:32] BRUTALIT0PS: I bet they do something like EQ did and have multiple Classic servers that are time release and such
[3:48:33] drhobox: mop would be tight just cause of the pvp.... it was so much better in mop than any other expac
[3:48:36] HotHotHeals: BC pvp was fire
[3:48:41] Ignizshun: have rfun getting hand of adal lol
[3:48:45] vintersorgSA: heroic dungeons were fucking overtuned as well
[3:48:45] Blitzylive: we WANT WOD Classic
[3:48:46] TreetheTerrible: if i could face arthus in his prime i would nut
[3:48:46] r0b928: @towelliee did you hear about warchief gaming??
[3:48:49] CipansR_Ayaya: D:
[3:48:55] Artivicii: Season 3 best season
[3:49:01] raymond3195: cats will be release
[3:49:03] MetallicusGaming: r0b928 ofc he did
[3:49:07] mainetrev: sunwell was so great
[3:49:09] Drakenking: @CoachCamoCarry You're rocking some rose tinted glasses man there are specs that are absolutely fucking insane in BC PVP and were way overtuned for the whole expansion
[3:49:11] r0b928: 👍🏻
[3:49:11] Alienfromger: depends on the patch they will using
[3:49:12] radiorahem: Them rep grinds NotLikeThis
[3:49:15] Huffthegreat: Oooooo worrrrd
[3:49:17] ArcaneSyntax: yeah you can play shaman dps in BC.
[3:49:18] jarilrpg: you think they will have progression servers for classic? @towelliee
[3:49:18] LegoCoin: Dailies LUL
[3:49:30] CipansR_Ayaya: ^
[3:49:34] AnDy_the_Dj: I want Shadowlands Classic!
[3:49:38] Zorikune: My favorite attunment was the one for Nightbane in Karazhan
[3:49:41] Thunderbrew: Is there a guess when BC Classic will come out?
[3:49:51] Artivicii: Farming shadow, fire, and nature resist gear 4Head so fun
[3:50:00] Peepoblink: I mean tbc is just so much better
[3:50:00] vintersorgSA: and running karazhan non-stop for badges lol
[3:50:01] crawcook: They definitely should keep Classic separate.
[3:50:21] wien3ss: how are you getting so much exp per mob?
[3:50:26] Huffthegreat: I don’t think anyone would play classic is BC came out
[3:50:30] JonnyScotland: I would just love to run TBC ZA 10 man raid again, My fav raid ever
[3:50:30] Veras_7: do you think SSC and the eye will be pugble like bwl/MC is now?
[3:50:32] radiorahem: Vanilla classic overrated feelsbadman only the leveling was great
[3:50:33] Vigi9413: how longg would you quit retail for TBC classic @Towelliee
[3:50:34] LegoCoin: yeah I would prefer new content to classic. I think about 90% would too truthfully. Although I think hype makes more of the 10% go up to 30-40% that play for short amount of time.
[3:50:39] keeindordel: i want them to release TBC in phases but like each phase was a patch
[3:50:42] MetallicusGaming: wien3ss DMF buff, anniversary buff, and exp potion
[3:50:47] ArcaneSyntax: summer next year is a little early for 9.2
[3:50:47] Thunderbrew: Are the quality of life improvements in BC worth playing. I couldn't stand how slow Vanilla WoW was.
[3:50:50] Kelluthus: They just need to "reset" classic so everyone just starts all over again. There you go, always get your classic experience.
[3:50:57] Artivicii: I think I’ve ran karazhan more than any other raid slootHmm
[3:50:57] Eviltuna13: I can’t wait for 5-6 years till WoD classic rooDerp
[3:51:03] sl1nky1981: As long as they don't bring back the comically small orc shoulders, I would play classic BC.
[3:51:06] ArcaneSyntax: i think 9.1 is summer next year.
[3:51:13] demonicus: I plan to main a tank for shadowlands, what do you think will be the best and/or most fun tank spec to play for mythic+ and raiding?
[3:51:14] Aidler: if 2021 becomes a relativly normal year again
[3:51:23] BeepBeeplmaJeep: @Thunderbrew There are no quality of life improvements in tbc
[3:51:27] RuineMi: god all these twitch ads are getting annoying
[3:51:29] Sprucemoose: @demonicus he's gonna say prot paladin but he's not wrong lol
[3:51:32] m__ber: BC was the tits
[3:51:42] Vigi9413: we won't be back to normal until at least 2022 or later
[3:52:08] BRUTALIT0PS: BC was the biggest upgrade imo from one expansion to another
[3:52:10] demonicus: @Sprucemoose i want to play a prot war, but everyone i asked including my friends say its bad af
[3:52:11] radiorahem: Blood elf starting zones gonna be full LUL
[3:52:11] ArcaneSyntax: bunch of specs get viable in BC, including all the hybrids.
[3:52:11] ukator: anyone know the Nameplates he is running?
[3:52:14] GhostsWasteland: 1 min for stream raiders!
[3:52:22] Thunderbrew: Does BC Classic have Dungeon Queueing?
[3:52:25] MetallicusGaming: ukator plater
[3:52:30] Sephpt: Ive played BC up to SCC/TK.. it is very easy tbh.... u cant kill raids in 40 mins cause there are no world buffs.. but no challenge
[3:52:38] ToadyMcToadFace: Can I play streamraiders?
[3:52:39] ukator: @MetallicusGaming gracias
[3:52:40] LegoCoin: @ukator pretty sure thats part of ElvUi
[3:52:44] Artivicii: Warriors were great tanks in TBC but bears and Prot pallies had a huge impact too
[3:52:46] m__ber: @Thunderbrew no, you still had to find groups manually
[3:52:48] Charbeans: Had my best times in BC, best raiding, best friendships
[3:52:50] ArcaneSyntax: holy shit summon stones will actually be in the game @towelliee
[3:52:53] MetallicusGaming: !battle

[3:53:43] WordlawXIV: ThatCritLuck subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! We were just talking about how things felt easier in previous exspanions the other day. It was much easier to enter Heroic raiding when it only required 10 people than Mythic with 20.
[3:53:43] Moobot: Thanks @THATCRITLUCK for subbing for 8 months! towHAMUP
[3:53:45] Huffthegreat: Can’t wait for that red wave am I right

[3:54:23] Zhiril: The proto heroic dungeon is coming to classic with Atiesh quest chain.

[3:55:53] ArcaneSyntax: honestly im expecting classic naxx to be cleared faster than wrath nacc was.

[4:14:13] duhworks: thank god for ad block
[4:14:14] MR_WYTE: So is the only benefit of Twitch Prime a free sub now?
[4:14:17] Velashen: Ublock works on anything with some tweaking.
[4:14:17] BramishEU: on twitch site it says 'If streamer plays 90 decs of adds, it disables mid roll ads for 30mins' so maybe you need to play them at top and bottom of the hour?
[4:14:18] LegoCoin: I get pre-roll online on all channels with flipping unless I am subbed to streamer

[5:56:51] Snabido: Is it really worth the time tho, they nerfed it?
[5:57:27] Avinar: @Biggs_o7 both ele and enhance have been really fun for me and I'm a range main but I enjoy melee dps a lot so I like having the option to melee and range, but sort've thought on just having a rogue alt since I enjoy them lol
[5:57:45] Inishima: I wouldnt mind lvling from 1 - 50 in 3h
[5:57:46] demonicus: @MOLAR305 Thing is i really want to play a prot warrior, but everyone just keeps saying its bad, and i dont want to play a spec that no one will want in their group
[5:57:47] Nougat_V: but is that not exploiting the system?
[5:57:59] ak1379: best tank of S L ?

[6:00:40] Ahunamongus: I don't see whats boring about a giant bear tanking everything nearby and keeping team safe is very satisfying to me.
[6:00:46] swordart_19: @tealedger MAP bottom right who is lead to that person you sync
[6:00:55] TreeBadBoy: bear is like a meat and fur ball that resists tons of dmg

[7:58:44] legendarydarkstar: @vguana 7 years!!!!!!!
[7:58:44] LabsTip: I suggest drinking water vs. any artificially flavored beverage. If you want a boost, consider black coffee, green tea, or other natural sources of caffeine. Ultimately, natural and unaltered ingredients are usually a healthier option.
[7:58:54] leetelz: @towelliee what addon do you have for your skill buttons?

[8:29:16] TompsonX: Maybe it starts chronologically LULW
[8:29:34] GiraffeHydra_: DMCA = Dick Music Company Asshattery
[8:29:40] Utmost777: Think of them as Goblins who see an easy way to make money
[8:29:41] AntiHeroATX: JakeandBake had one where someone drove by in a car playing a song that got him DMCAd LUL
[8:29:42] 2naDlisch: They want that cash
[8:29:42] SonofHorus82: damn imagine the embarassment when you get DMCA'd over a fucking DMX clip...
[8:29:49] DecayedmiNt: Likely because they have nothing else to do with lockdowns
[8:29:52] N3llee: on trains podcast they were talking about a streamer that was driving down the road and radio playing music from car next him pulled up beside him and he got DMCA strike for it
[8:29:55] Coriollis: is not a human check, is a bot who gets through endless hours of data
[8:29:55] throwawaym3: Big Multi-billion Record Labels > Some kid that streams video games in his basement.
[8:29:58] Scojan: RIAA will sue a large streamer then people will finally pay attention to DMCA @Towelliee
[8:30:01] laughing_octopus: i like this stream time @Towelliee
[8:30:05] Antdavs24: was it dmx just barking? Kappa
[8:30:07] smashwow: didn't fair use, use to cover 30 seconds or less
[8:30:18] FatChase: I think the DMCA stuff where they walk past a store playing music, or a car drives past playing music is being unreasonable
[8:30:19] jkitchin75: whats riaa?
[8:30:23] Gaaralock: I met DMX at a dunkin donuts in downtown Chicago...

[8:30:29] Zip13: 5Head play, let’s dmca people using bots and then people will buy our music LULW
[8:30:29] angryhonkinggoose: Next step, streamers paying monthly to each game publisher to be able to stream games
[8:30:30] GiraffeHydra_: Wait, so X gave it to him?
[8:30:36] SonofHorus82: I cannot deny it. X Gonna Give it to Ya is still towards the top of my playlists.
[8:30:45] Draugrs: I get it but again it is also free advertisement for the groups and their songs.
[8:30:51] JanglelegJenkins: so what, you can't play spotify even if you pay for the services for the songs
[8:30:58] JanglelegJenkins: ?
[8:31:10] Coriollis: proly they are forcing twitch to aquire a radio station license for the platform I think this is the issue
[8:31:16] smashwow: @8GallonsOfSauteedGophers X's publisher gave it to him Kappa
[8:31:17] Kobool: so why are they killing these bosses ?
[8:31:17] osatox: @Draugrs doesn't matter , it's $ that record labels aren't getting, it's 100% clear that they're greedy fudgers
[8:31:18] ungul: @Towelliee if you have twitter open already look at #Strajkobiet and look at what is going on in Poland right now. Na zdrowie
[8:31:23] Solidious_Games: @8gallonsofsauteedgophers lol I saw what you did there.
[8:31:25] liqslip: Kids learning about corporate america
[8:31:27] Aidler: my way of discovering new songs was twitch. no idea how I can do that now....
[8:31:32] DecayedmiNt: @JanglelegJenkins Nope because you're only paying for your rights to listen to the music. Not everyone else in stream.
[8:31:35] throwawaym3: @Draugrs They dont want your free advertisement lol
[8:31:46] Nauk: LUL
[8:31:46] BowSec: Yo.. the IT guy in me wants to hit up streamers and build them an SNAS for them to just write their streams to lol
[8:31:49] propwash80: @Towelliee do you think it will get easier to unlock some of the allied races once SL is out or do you think you'll still need to complete the whole story to get the achievement?

[8:32:28] alex12645: you did played acdc
[8:32:29] osatox: b/c 1 more then you're gone
[8:32:30] Coriollis: @Thunderbrew they know the 10 viewers Joe can't afford something like that so they are forcing Twitch hand
[8:32:31] MrGattz: @Draugrs its pretty complex but yeah its free advertising. but what if no one heard the song before some live stream, and they were on the fence about getting it. but then they heard it on stream and decided nah the song sucks. now the publisher and artist just lost potential money that they could have gotten otherwise. its free advertising but there are negative affects to it.
[8:32:32] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Would of took down the entire platform LULW

[8:33:17] DecayedmiNt: @ms_enyo Yup
[8:33:18] RedDeadFredd: My guess is there are using the bot bans as a proof of concept to do something like youtube does. Ad revenues go to music companies instead of streamers
[8:33:18] osatox: @ms_enyo Yes. 3 and you're perma'd, no chance to appeal or come back

[8:33:29] Fluisterwoud: @Towelliee What about chest opening music PepeHands
[8:33:42] NetherRegion: Its about the money lost from hearing it first somewhere other than from original artist.
[8:33:43] JanglelegJenkins: so they can't appeal to get unbanned?
[8:33:48] DanielDotWav: so its just because of clips/vods/highlights?
[8:34:01] NewYorkBeard: I dont like watching streams that are blasting music

[8:34:38] Dewstin: twitch 2020: hey good job streaming,but remember that 1 stream like 7 years ago, ya you cant play that music again.
[8:34:39] TacticalKabuki: DMCAs isnt on twitch.. they tried to warn the streamers
[8:34:41] Jaboo: what is project 50?
[8:34:41] Aidler: I'd say it's more about controll then money. yes money follows of course. twitch is international and everyone everywhere can hear songs. they want to controll that.
[8:34:48] KingSlayerYotam: do streamers not know they dont actually own any of there vods?
[8:34:49] spleen1015: @kittywittywithfatcatss Where are they going to go?
[8:34:51] GreatBlueStars: The record companies are so stupid.. its free publicity for them to let streamers use the music.
[8:34:59] Sylnus: stream raider ready @Towelliee
[8:35:00] DecayedmiNt: @kittywittywithfatcatss They can't do anything to stop it. Outside of giving an avenue to play music in the future.
