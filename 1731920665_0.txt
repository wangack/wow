[3:09:08] Knocx: you god dam right
[3:09:09] Broomba: TRUE
[3:09:09] stallowned: spreading hate and harrassing people never solves anything.
[3:09:25] smsamsa: the point is you saying you are not associated with it doesn´t mean anything. jkr makes life miserable for a group of people you are not part of (lbtqi+ and jews(storyplot)) and i can understand that these people are outraged if streamers say "not my problem
[3:09:27] zeiours: someone donated to summit stream saying why are you supporting this etc, summit just said you have your own opinion, don't change mine over a video game.

[3:09:35] ic3k0ld: don't even give them attention, that's one thing that is wanted
[3:09:36] 91Niki: Tldr: let people enjoy things and stop shoving your opinions down their throat towLove Then we can all just be happy
[3:09:41] Vakje: Those people are the pits. If you stop consuming content you like because someone involved in it has different views than yours, you'll never consume any content ever

[4:33:23] Sollice: I think people say WoW is a 20 year old game so it should run on a potato which it can probably due. But there have done so many engine updates and enhancements over the year its not really a 20 year old game
[4:33:41] Sollice: So trying to run the game on an I3 550 aint going to do it chief
[4:33:43] Molvonos: Yes.  Please be kind to your hamster - buy a new wheel.
[4:33:45] tehrobtar: ^ almost exactly what my friend said this past weekend

[4:56:56] neverbornlucky: Towelliee I know how to build my own pc but sometimes the separate parts can cost more then getting one prebuilt with  parts that can be changed out later

[4:57:52] snake_like: the last two years made pre-builts worth more than ever. I never would have considered it before
[4:57:55] Sollice: if I wanted to spend the money I would absolutely get a pre made. For nothing other than cable management. I HATE CABLE MANAGEMENT
[4:58:00] L__E__A__F: Anoffday yeahh, the second build went good but the first time i slammed that shit in and was like ohh no :(
[4:58:06] CoffeeBrake: Building gaming PCs was my side hustle in college - for the gamers wanting to play OG modern warfare and WOTLK.   At the point in my life now where I just want shit to work out of the box, so my next build will be a pre-built order.

[5:04:34] Sollice: @Rodenbo Problem with those PCs #1 the case is a 20 year old case and you can see that by airflow or lake there of, you also dont know the quality of ram, mobo or anything.

[5:04:43] 3dRes: @Masqerader just checked the specs and needless to say, for that price, I've seen better
[5:05:10] Rodenbo: man yall some overpaying namebrand andies
[5:05:31] Heero_Effect: @rodenbo seems like an Alienware price and hardware. At least with Alienware you have Dell’s support

[5:05:58] Rodenbo: dell's support is like comcast support. they don't exist
[5:06:06] Masqerader: i love council, like watching an std get spread at spring break in FLA
[5:06:12] Sollice: @Rodenbo Nah just good to know exactly what parts you get. I am going to say in that picture its a 2 fan MSI Ventus GPU and the VEntus ones are bottom of the barrel and run hot

[5:33:24] fewyn: the devs/community are very anti-addons for some reason
[5:33:29] Alaysian07: The JP team that got the first kill had their titles and weapons stripped by SE cause of addon usage.
[5:33:34] Inswayne: Hey just started WoW, hit 60 and am grinding through the BFA quests. Is there a gear limit to access raid finder? It is grayed out for me even though I am lvl 60

[5:33:38] krazykat1183: it was an add on that zoomed out and allowed the raid to see the entire raid platform.... it was an exploit that the guild used to get first kill
[5:33:40] FluffehZ: wut you calling me?! towRee towHAMUP
[5:33:46] im_capy: emotional Damage
[5:33:56] theDirtyon3: they were practically cheating
[5:34:02] ZeusDNA: Yeah that zoom out was insane lol
[5:34:29] Snabido: Saronite bomb type of cheating? 👀
[5:34:36] JustSeren1ty: @Heero_Effect You cant throw everybody in the same pot man. The FF Community isnt only hating add ons. Many many ppl would like to have some add ons/Improvements ingame.
[5:34:38] ZeusDNA: FF could have prevented that by putting a ton of trees in that block your view no matter how far out you zoom KEKW
[5:34:48] trolltrucked: do you have strike twice?
[5:34:55] WaverlyP15: correct, ive only been turning upgradable into tier
[5:35:16] trolltrucked: wait what was the weapon again? im gonna copy you bro
[5:35:49] JustSeren1ty: but imo add ons making the game far easier and wow would be cooler without them,but thats just my opinion as not casusal player^^
[5:35:59] diorcasketz: Did yall finish last raid?
[5:36:28] MysticalOS: the key is to not stream them
[5:36:40] MysticalOS: if you stream them square has to action it/set an example
[5:36:41] Traulk: i think there is a bug wher the number doesnt go up
[5:36:46] Lloyder47: noice I got spiteful storm from from 4 dungeon chest

[5:37:02] Traulk: reload
[5:37:08] trolltrucked: im trying to see what toweliee's build is
[5:37:18] theDirtyon3: its just bugged rn i think
[5:37:26] brooklynitetv: I thought I had 2 but it said 1
[5:37:35] theDirtyon3: i had the same visual bug
[5:37:41] Raxxiety: you need the weakaura for it
[5:37:49] brooklynitetv: It's a dps loss if I catalyst 1 instead of the 2 so I didn't do it because I was scared. Bug?
[5:38:09] PlayGrumpy: It shows the "cost" not the count you have.  There is a script on wowhead that lets you see how many you actually have.

[5:52:19] Havoc_S1: If they other ones approve it MS can just say we won’t sell cod to uk anymore.
[5:52:58] abracka_: the game that shall not be named has exclusive content on the PS5 which won't even be available for xbox/PC until sometime next year  lol

[5:58:33] Yagr6: See its ok for sony to have exclusive but when someone else tries to get exclusives then sony points the finger hypocrisy
[5:58:48] PlayGrumpy: true, forgot about that
[5:58:56] WaverlyP15: mircorsoft has already said they arent going to console lock it, they would lose money doing that
[5:59:36] mavericks312: @Yagr6 i wouldnt say its an exclusive thing more then it is a sales thing CoD does more numbers on PS then it does MS
[5:59:37] Havoc_S1: I think they are gonna have to put it on paper that cod won’t ever be exclusive on xbox
[5:59:39] Sollice: @Yagr6 Of course. If Sony had the money to purchase Activision they would have no problem with owning CoD

[5:59:43] Yagr6: thats not good enough for sony they have exclusive content for cod for years
[6:00:05] mavericks312: @Yagr6 you dont see sony wanting halo,gears, or forza
[6:00:25] PlayGrumpy: ya no way would they lock cod for xbox, the biggest market for cod is on playstation.  It would be a bad business decision
[6:00:26] Sollice: @Havoc_S1 They have already committed to 10 years and I think Phil has stated publically it wont ever happen. I don't know they could put it in paper though its their franchise to won. They would have to sign a deal with Sony which MS has tried to do and Sony has rejected
[6:00:37] Yagr6: @mavericks312 its not bc they dont want it , its bc its already owned by MS
[6:00:38] instant_savage: its sinple, sony has cod exclusives, the solution is u make xbox only exculivies and let the player choose which one they wamt
[6:00:39] Havoc_S1: @mavericks312 they literally bought bungie that’s pretty close
[6:00:54] WaverlyP15: sony is just mad they cant have exlusive cod shit anymore, possibly driving down sales
[6:01:09] Yagr6: @mavericks312 MS aint selling those titles period
[6:01:10] PlayGrumpy: The funniest part of this is playstation always has "exclusive" content for COD and they are complaining that MS may do the same
[6:01:22] mavericks312: @Havoc_S1 they didnt buy bungie to make a halo knockoff lol they bought bungie to manage there live service games in general
[6:01:31] Sollice: Oh.....Sony would want Halo. Now that they own Bungie. Come on tell me a Sony owned Bungie Halo game wouldnt destroy
[6:01:32] Havoc_S1: @sollice yeah I know and Sony is acting like my 5 year that isn’t getting there way
[6:01:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: meanwhile everyone that wants to play FF16 has to buy a PS5
[6:01:47] Yagr6: Yea like i said sony are hypocrites
[6:02:08] Havoc_S1: @mavericks312 actually I heard they are making a marathon game wich halo is based off of.
