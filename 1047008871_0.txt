[1:08:20] Korek302: couldnt you just switch weapons instead of drinking the potion?
[1:08:20] CallMeKogeren: @sodapoppin  couldnt you just equip and unequip atiesh to not have to stock up on potions?

[8:19:41] Nooneqt: @FriendlyLich sorry to say that, but you probably have to deal with pugs till you get like 2-2.2k and can reliably time 21-22 keys. After that lvl you'll just meet good players, try to be social, add them, gather your own group. The real push is more of a social interaction than the game itself, if you don't have a group :) you have to form one from the ppl you meet in pugs
