[2:46:47] Digmadness: When microsoft takes over I am certain they will go big

[2:48:28] Decayingg: too many abilities, too many passives, too many buffs, and ive been a pretty hardcore raider for 15 years now
[2:48:48] insectplato: tnh i know ppl who like current retail so im not sure there will be a wow 2
[2:48:55] Digmadness: yep same and what you say is true
[2:49:01] wagyu_88: Does blizzard not see the # decline in retail. they need to figure it out man, lots of ppl dont like it.
[2:49:23] Decayingg: blizzard still makes loads of money
[2:49:33] Digmadness: I doubt blizzard will do anything different until microsoft is in charge
[2:49:35] Decayingg: for very little in return(servers and bugfixing)
[2:49:41] konczpete: @wagyu_88 lots of people like it though
[2:49:42] Decayingg: and the ocasional expansion
[2:49:43] Digmadness: bobby
[2:49:47] insectplato: the raiders and the arenaholics will play retail no matter what
[2:49:49] baronashbury: swifty ended up talking too much and forgot his character's health that was a close one lol
[2:49:58] Decayingg: i mean
[2:50:03] Digmadness: Spencer will save wow
[2:50:11] Decayingg: i was a raider for 15 years, usually on top 500 guilds, even us get bored
[2:50:18] JonnyScotland: Playing hardcore while streaming must make it 10x harder
[2:50:19] Decayingg: most of my latest guilds have broken up cause of it
[2:50:26] baronashbury: it's sad that casual retail pvp is kinda dead rn
[2:50:30] Decayingg: of retail that is
[2:50:36] wagyu_88: @konczpete  compared to the numbers they had before its extremely low. even if ppl still play it
[2:50:38] Decayingg: No
[2:50:42] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:50:42] Decayingg: its becauise it feels the same
[2:50:53] Decayingg: doesnt feel refreshing and fun anyumore
[2:51:02] shadowd0899: i just watched what happened with that raptor, he crit you right before you finished him
[2:51:04] konczpete: @wagyu_88 that is kinda natural
[2:51:06] Decayingg: its like a chore, grind this, grind that, go for 3 months into a raid
[2:51:09] insectplato: unpopular opinion: they should never have gotten rid of titanforging. it made wqs worth doing
[2:51:10] Decayingg: and sadly, arenas are dying
[2:51:13] baronashbury: i feel like wow needs a new game mode to stay relevant and competent tbh
[2:51:16] super_cyborg_franky: @baronashbury all i live for is chill bgs but after season 1 its impossible to have non slaughters
[2:51:25] JonnyScotland: Doing something for 15 + years is bound to become borinbg
[2:51:29] JonnyScotland: boring*
[2:51:46] baronashbury: @super_cyborg_franky that's how i felt too man
[2:51:46] Decayingg: New world honestly seems really fun
[2:51:51] Decayingg: with the new patch they are doing
[2:52:11] Decayingg: FF14 seems really fun when it comes to raids at least
[2:52:19] Decayingg: DIfficult content and new mechanics
[2:52:19] baronashbury: do you think pvp would be more alive if it had 2v2 solo q mode?
[2:52:22] Shaq0: use your mana more
[2:52:34] Decayingg: nop, pvp is a nogo
[2:53:02] Decayingg: it feels like, back in the day, like 2012-2018 we had more games to play
[2:53:04] JonnyScotland: it has pvp, but it's terrible, they even admit it
[2:53:08] Scudbomb: PVP is where its at
[2:53:11] baronashbury: there are games that have way better pvp tho but they are not mmos
[2:53:11] Decayingg: it feels like games arent as substantial anymore
[2:53:12] Digmadness: I play wow still as my main since 05 its great just needs fine tunning and I do not think it will happen with current leadership i.e the bobs, I think when spencer and microsoft take over it will be done proper (hoping)
[2:53:14] Decayingg: compared to wow per se
[2:53:35] unsolved_return: Defo need more battlegrounds
[2:53:36] Decayingg: we shall see
[2:53:42] Decayingg: see where the lore takes us
[2:53:47] Decayingg: blizzcon is tommorow right?
[2:54:03] Scudbomb: @Decayingg nope, its in like early november
[2:54:08] baronashbury: i don't think that having more bg maps would solve the issue league afterall has 1 map and it's so successful in comparison to wow
[2:54:08] XanthChaser: Nov 1st
[2:54:14] Decayingg: yep, myb
[2:54:42] Decayingg: what is the new expansion gonna be now
[2:54:48] Decayingg: probably some kind of dream themed xpac?
[2:55:12] insectplato: dragonflight started with a bang. loved all the world pvp at the beginning
[2:55:20] konczpete: @baronashbury right, something i will never ever understand
[2:55:32] zeihro: What up Swifty!
[2:55:34] davidzeta: Hola Swifty buenas nochess
[2:55:37] baronashbury: ppl will always come back to wow for a month or two when new pvp expansion gets released regardless  of how good it is imo
[2:56:13] GoreScum: I stopped using solo shuffle when my queues would hit 40 mins
[2:56:35] baronashbury: @konczpete ppl just get addicted to climbing the ladder and they don't care about anything else they just become too competitive
[2:56:44] longfellow2008: Where do I download addons?
[2:57:04] Decayingg: try using curseforge @longfellow2008
[2:57:15] Decayingg: its a program that allows oyu to download addons through it
[2:57:17] baronashbury: @GoreScum i think that having 40 min queues in any other game would be considered dead but there are ppl saying that pvp is still super popular lol
[2:57:20] davidzeta: Wow i didnt know that
[2:57:23] longfellow2008: Is it legit? Sorry I’m new to WoW
[2:57:23] zeihro: Is this your first hardcore Swifty?
[2:57:24] konczpete: @baronashbury yeah, you are defo right, for me it is brainless
[2:57:39] Decayingg: yep @longfellow2008 everyone uses it\
[2:57:42] Scudbomb: Simply fix MMR, lol
[2:58:05] baronashbury: @konczpete it's brainless for anyone who can resist an addiction and not take it seriously
[2:58:07] ReelAdam: My problem with retail is that it's simply too easy. And this makes most items meaningless, which makes the economy tank, which makes professions somewhat pointless. Also makes content dry up faster.
[2:58:08] JonnyScotland: @baronashbury it is popular but everyone wants to be dps
[2:58:12] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:58:27] GoreScum: @baronashbury The system was screwed
[2:58:40] Decayingg: sadly the only fun healer in pvp the disc priest was GUTTED
[2:58:40] baronashbury: @JonnyScotland 40 min queues say otherwise sadly :/
[2:58:45] JonnyScotland: @ReelAdam retail is harder than classic wow etc? what do you mean? or you mean to easy to gear?
[2:58:47] insectplato: the success of BG3 proves that ppl want solo open-world content
[2:59:03] JonnyScotland: @baronashbury no because you need healers.
[2:59:13] JonnyScotland: @baronashbury there is lots of dps but no healers, so you wait
[2:59:15] Scudbomb: just have triple dps solo shuffle
[2:59:16] Scudbomb: LOL
[2:59:26] baronashbury: yeah we are just talking about queue times and how bad they are why should anyone wait 40 min just to play the part of the game they like
[2:59:27] Decayingg: Baldurs Gate 3
[2:59:31] scumpfanforlife: sup swifty
[2:59:39] insectplato: baldurs gate
[2:59:48] baronashbury: solo shuffle was a mistake imo i don't like it
[2:59:55] insectplato: its an opemn world game
[3:00:13] Decayingg: tbh it liuteraly killed pvp sadly
[3:00:22] Beinet75: bg3 best game ever tbh
[3:00:28] GoreScum: A bad executed good idea LUL
[3:00:31] baronashbury: bad queues and it's too random
[3:00:37] insectplato: mistake or not, players were asking fopr it since forever
[3:00:42] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:00:45] baronashbury: @GoreScum that's one way to put it
[3:00:46] Scudbomb: yes
[3:00:49] JonnyScotland: I personally think healer and tank role in wow ruins the game
[3:00:52] Decayingg: that would actually be super fun
[3:00:53] Scudbomb: lets do triple DPS baby
[3:00:56] Decayingg: a breath of resh air
[3:00:57] Decayingg: a new meta
[3:00:58] ReelAdam: @JonnyScotland just that in classic most enemies actually feel like a threat. Not that the mechanics are harder, but you actually take damage and each piece of gear/upgrade means something.
[3:01:02] GoreScum: I would
[3:01:03] Digmadness: SeemsGood
[3:01:05] Scudbomb: i would
[3:01:12] radpogi: TRIPLE TANK VS TRIPLE TANKS LOL
[3:01:12] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[3:03:20] Scudbomb: Yeah, just gotta fix MMR. It cant be that hard, lol
[3:03:24] baronashbury: they can't progress and healing randoms can be annoying from time to time
[3:03:25] Brizereins: i know you*
[3:03:52] baronashbury: they are wayyy more focused on pve for the past few years for sure
[3:04:20] DeadBananaTV: Sup Swifty :D
[3:05:01] baronashbury: can't they merge healers mmr and dps mmr and fix it?
[3:05:25] Scudbomb: is it still that way, have you tried recently?
[3:05:50] Scudbomb: I went from 0 - 1800 in 2 days on arms warrior lol
[3:07:00] Brizereins: im lost player i wanna know if bloodlust gonna be there in rbg on cata? and if Sp gonna be a  must have you think?
