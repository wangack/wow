[0:05:56] lordelenath: I'm still looking for an explanation on why echo didn't q MLD into hoolibang on cup 1. you've talked to them or know why? felt like an easy counter to me as a noob.
[0:06:04] voteforpedro064: whatcha eating? looks like yogurt and granola.
[0:06:36] lordelenath: sounds dope
[0:06:45] shitywok: why does crusader call you shitruki
[0:06:57] SaltyBites: @lordelenath they didnt prac it, thought other comp had more chance
[0:07:01] s0lklar: @lordelenath Raiku allegedly had 150 ping that's why they switched him off when they noticed
[0:07:10] rivellana: yoooo how's it going today? rukiBuddy

[0:07:28] ItsJhelo: Wait how is cup 2 already being played, I thought cup 1 literally just finished
[0:07:36] ItsJhelo: Also why isnt there an official stream for it?
[0:07:44] Deyconn: mvq is streaming too
[0:07:46] shitywok: whens awc start boys

[0:08:20] ItsJhelo: @lordelenath Awesome thank you. Didnt realize there would be such a quick turn around between the two tournaments.
[0:08:27] shitywok: he calls you veganshitruki
[0:08:33] shitywok: weird guy
[0:08:50] primejusticegaming: yooo what up ven!
[0:08:55] yippey_: Mornin Ven!!
[0:09:00] Sixnoluv: he calls him BigDikRuki, what y'all talking about?
[0:09:04] Mhortai: Crusader says crazy stuff about everyone doesn't he? lol
[0:09:14] heymomimonttv: it's just typical crusader behavior idk why anyone puts any weight into what he says lol
[0:09:20] lordelenath: honestly crusader is toxic
[0:09:24] zerx_gg: i'd like to see him try !!1!!!!! ! ! !!!!
[0:09:30] goatjo___: You cant take crusader seriously
[0:09:31] heymomimonttv: he prob has no reason for saying the things he says he just says it cuz thats his shtick
[0:09:45] lordelenath: when we watched him stream last week I had to turn off your stream venruke. dont want to endorse flaming your team mates like that.
[0:10:05] dailyshuffle: i mean ven played his evoker, if ven would play his mage, he would destroy him ngl
[0:10:07] goatjo___: I had fun when we watched him on here
[0:10:12] Sixnoluv: If he wasn't toxic, no one would compare to his skill level
[0:10:14] goatjo___: he clearly cares about the game lol
[0:10:16] Xeliumimar: i can't even take him in small doses
[0:10:21] bigislandcoconuts: things we don’t like about another person is apart of ourselves we have disowned
[0:10:22] williwhite94: small doses haha nicely said
[0:10:23] seekerimSENI: that guy is mentally handicapped stop trying to wind him up for no reason lol
[0:10:34] Luigicamp: I don't think he comes in small doses Kappa
[0:10:35] artagore: I think crusader i fun tbh, it remind me tyler1 from League of legend
[0:10:35] lordelenath: "caring about the game" doesnt mean you can be a complete asshole.
[0:10:36] zerx_gg: ive been thinking about playing wow again, talk me out of it
[0:10:41] malvarcla: crusader aint no where near the best lmao
[0:10:43] Cvarks: we see our hero talents today!
[0:10:44] SwiisH_Tv: hes funny so ill watch here and there but i refuse to even follow him
[0:10:46] rockxtv: I feel like he wants to be Tyler1 but lacks the self-awareness
[0:10:50] Vramii: there is zero chance crusader is  really like that, he has to be doing it because he thinks he's funny. His emotional; maturity stopped at age 12
[0:10:55] Infernum1207: crusader just banned me in chat becourse i asked if he is okay
[0:11:00] ItsJhelo: You put crusader next to Cdew and I think he looks like a joke tbh
[0:11:06] Sixnoluv: I think the only thing preventing his skill level from improving is his own psyche, that's all
[0:11:11] betasoldier: Bicmex in now
[0:11:13] zerx_gg: what are hero talents
[0:11:35] SwiisH_Tv: Do you guys think Crusaders like that rl? or is it a front for stream?
[0:11:37] Sixnoluv: @ItsJhelo Cdew plays shaman, easy class
[0:11:41] lordelenath: I love myself a good BigMacx
[0:11:44] Kooznik: hero talents out now
[0:11:52] Kooznik: @venruki
[0:11:55] rockxtv: against Hoolibang?
[0:11:59] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: what are hero talents?
[0:12:00] ItsJhelo: @Sixnoluv Cdew has played every healer, he could play h pal and be better than crusader
[0:12:07] ryanblue98: I cant wait for crusader to get banned again and falls back into irrelevancy where he belongs
[0:12:07] infraredpen: your cam is covering their party frames, in case you wanna move it @venruki
[0:12:08] lordelenath: hoolibang gonna clap their cheeks?
[0:12:11] Kooznik: yes they literally just came out as u said that hahaha
[0:12:14] SquidSosa: priest ones are out
[0:12:29] ItsJhelo: @Sixnoluv There is a reason you dont see Crusader on the AWC main stage, he cant compare :/
[0:12:31] SquidSosa: oh syke nvm its all out
[0:12:33] infraredpen: appreciate it <3
[0:12:33] Sixnoluv: @ItsJhelo hmm, i've never seen him play hpal at high level
[0:12:56] lordelenath: Is jayti simply the best priest ever?
[0:12:58] Sixnoluv: @ItsJhelo we don't see him because no one wants to play with the toxicity, that's all lol. Nothing to do with skill
[0:12:59] infraredpen: i love watching this ww/sub team lol
[0:13:05] indrah___: they got a bad first match
[0:13:05] Mhortai: @Sixnoluv I am pretty sure he has won a cup/tourney playing HPal
[0:13:10] goesidd: He played hpala in df s1
[0:13:16] SwiisH_Tv: its actually wild that Jay said they just started playing together before cup 1
[0:13:21] rockxtv: bicmex could be an auctioneetr
[0:13:22] goesidd: Melee wings patch
[0:13:28] Sixnoluv: @Mhortai ahh fair enough
[0:13:39] Xeliumimar: Funny enough Mes said any sub rogue x comp would easily beat ww/sub/hpriest and it wouldnt be close lol
[0:13:53] lordelenath: that speed talking is genuinly impressive. did they train talking fast?
[0:14:02] ca11um3004: !ui
[0:14:02] Nightbot: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[0:14:09] Valcorexd: wonder if turbo comms sound like this Classic
[0:14:09] Sheepyou: jay is so crazy good at hpriest .. while everyone says hpriest sucks
[0:14:09] goesidd: @swiish_tv with howton, he and eredas played since bfa or sl he said
[0:14:33] rockxtv: OH SNAP
[0:14:33] dailyshuffle: nice
[0:14:33] SquidSosa: damnnn
[0:14:34] artagore: uh gg
[0:14:35] SaltyBites: omg
[0:14:38] artagore: Bicmex god
[0:14:44] indrah___: rap god
[0:14:47] kreyzy8: unironically I think this is the best team on EU to beat them lol
[0:14:53] kreyzy8: cuz they have a sub rogue LUL
[0:14:53] waelrick: super clean
[0:14:55] ATHLTE: ven is online bis
[0:14:57] rdubm: its realy good
[0:14:59] ItsJhelo: @Sixnoluv To be fair though, Im not saying crusader is bad. But players like Cdew who multiclass at a R1 level are on a diff level.
[0:15:02] heymomimonttv: it would be so wild if hoolibang was eliminated in the beginning
[0:15:06] SaltyBites: bic shotout
[0:15:06] heymomimonttv: bicmex ui is top tier
[0:15:12] rockxtv: you need to do like a UI doctor series or something @venruki
[0:15:20] SwiisH_Tv: @goesidd yeah i mean as a full team playing competently
[0:15:25] ATHLTE: its not bad honestly
[0:15:29] Cvarks: tmw is amazing
[0:15:30] ATHLTE: its pretty easy to use
[0:15:31] uninspire: TMW better for showing buffs on yourself, weakauras has worse display settings
[0:15:33] shugguls: think they played double disarm to stop the goes
[0:15:37] uninspire: and its just simpler
[0:15:41] Deyconn: what is tell me when?
[0:15:47] Sixnoluv: @ItsJhelo I just think if crusader wasn't toxic, he would be R1 no problem
[0:15:57] figurines: does rogue just make the games more damp because of control on enemy go too?
[0:16:09] artagore: last month Bicmex drop a 1h40 guid on youtube,it shows how this man is crazy at the game
[0:16:16] SwiisH_Tv: @Sixnoluv he has multi rank 1s
[0:16:21] SquidSosa: weak auras are just ez cause u can just import them
[0:16:25] bokioz: tune in to Echo game soon please
[0:16:28] Sixnoluv: @SwiisH_Tv tournament, not ladder
[0:16:29] ItsJhelo: @Sixnoluv He is R1, has been R1 like every season he plays Im pretty sure. But only on HPal. And big gap between being a R1 PvPer and an AWC winner.
[0:16:30] SquidSosa: mage ones are out
[0:16:36] Jubite: mvq v echo
[0:16:46] Mhortai: I think mvq is up against echo
[0:16:47] uninspire: is this the actual AWC? or is this warmup games
[0:16:51] SchnitzelOG: @venruki do you think caster Monk could make it to 2400 solo shuffle? or need to be fist weave
[0:16:52] SquidSosa: https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-hero-talents-revealed-priest-tripling-down-on-power-infusion-337611
[0:16:52] Mhortai: @Jubite beat me to it lol
[0:16:53] hollow1zed: @venruki i feel like rogues are a necessary evil to keep arena from becoming m+ where only the mana bar matters
[0:17:00] heymomimonttv: @uninspire this is qualifiers for cup 2
[0:17:46] heymomimonttv: i think following hoolibang today is prob a good idea as they're defending eu champs
[0:17:48] Cvarks: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24056542/get-an-early-look-at-hero-talents-for-druid-hunter-mage-and-priest
[0:17:50] Cvarks: they out
[0:18:01] uninspire: hoolibang supposed to be "figured out" by the teams now so lets see if thats real
[0:18:07] lordelenath: omfg this talking speed is insane

[0:18:36] sind233: bless you
[0:18:42] SwiisH_Tv: i love the hes got ___ ! I DONT CARE SENT IT!
[0:18:52] artagore: @uninspire that mean that they know how to counter them since the last tourny ?
[0:19:04] dailyshuffle: @driftwood_tc awc qualifier games
[0:19:17] Cvarks: ya only frostfire mage out, no others
[0:19:21] Cvarks: not bad tho
[0:19:29] xdtai: we are seeing more holy priest, damn
[0:19:53] lordelenath: everyone gonna run hpriest next cup? that would be so hilarious
[0:20:02] sind233: zen only plays Holy lol
[0:20:03] uninspire: hpriest great adaptation against WWSUB because hes way impossible to kill
[0:20:06] goesidd: These 2 teams always ran holy priest
[0:20:16] healmeshammy: lol
[0:20:23] Xeliumimar: does the priest just not even need to trinket
[0:20:28] zerx_gg: 12GB wow update jesus christ
[0:20:28] NPBeharry: time for Bicmex ww
[0:20:34] nightmxz: @Cvarks Me and my fellow spellslingers are PISSED Kappa
[0:20:37] zachgamegodx: their comms is 1.5x speed
[0:20:44] Cvarks: scuffed triune ward is so funny
[0:20:46] uninspire: whaaz was on a tear about this comp two days ago, he was saying WW sub isnt good because it can oneshot someone, its good because neither rogue ro WW or hpriest can be viable kill targets
[0:20:48] zachgamegodx: my morning brain cant keep up dude
[0:20:51] uninspire: theyre all so impossible to kill
[0:21:11] ellisrainy: after the games

[0:21:49] uninspire: i wanna see raiku SP hes been practicing
[0:21:56] lordelenath: they basically have go every kidney
[0:22:11] OGTweeter: who is the good holy priest to get a build?
[0:22:12] figurines: WW raw damage too stronk
[0:22:19] kreyzy8: the double or triple leg sweep is also really scary
[0:22:19] uninspire: i really think WW is flying udner the radar
[0:22:24] kreyzy8: the hunter can't do anything like that
[0:22:26] bokioz: WW is underrated
[0:22:30] OGTweeter: i heard the build changed
[0:22:36] nightmxz: @Cvarks the funniest thing is frost will have the best ring of fire uptime out of all the mage  specs LMAO

[0:24:26] zachgamegodx: @Tragictomb they hadnt practiced outside of a week before the tournament since mid shadowlands haha
[0:24:27] Saitistreamy: has ven looked at the Frostfire tree yet?
[0:24:30] Buccatini: Even the MW heals is super strong
[0:24:32] Mhortai: @Tragictomb I am pretty sure he would have retired if they won too though.

[0:25:50] Pajcsi: @lordelenath hope so
[0:25:54] figurines: WW auto cleaves too much imo
[0:25:55] infraredpen: rogue propaganda
[0:25:56] kreyzy8: yeah did you see infernion's tweet LUL
[0:25:59] nightmxz: I said WW monk was stronger after the armour changes :)
[0:26:03] indrah___: do you think they will nerf ww monk? @venruki
[0:26:03] kreyzy8: I'm guessing that's what you're referring to
[0:26:07] YouAint_VeryBusy: theyre just echoing crybaby whazz
[0:26:09] Saitistreamy: people have just slept on it because "caster meta" turns out Rogue and WW is nuts
[0:26:13] uninspire: its such a perfect storm of a comp, 3 instant ranged CCs with two highly mobile incredibly hard to kill targets, insane burst
[0:26:13] ItsJhelo: Everyone crying about DH's but I aint seeing any being played on winning comps :(
[0:26:13] nightmxz: More stam and armour changes = beter WW
[0:26:22] uninspire: caster meta??
[0:26:24] rockxtv: it's a slands melee fire mage, it's massive dam/survivability is enabled by rogue
[0:26:25] leeka: caster meta? WTF
[0:26:27] SwiisH_Tv: WW has been bad design imo for awhile they either op damage.. if they nerf the dmg theyre unplayable
[0:26:29] chaps_86: I've definitely seen a lot more ww and spriest this week
[0:26:29] filthyzx: caster meta????????? its ZUG ZUG META
[0:26:31] ATHLTE: LUL LUL
[0:26:33] uninspire: honestly the W sub plays like old RMP used to
[0:26:38] Saitistreamy: No one in awc is playing caster, i mean wow arena community
[0:26:39] Abruaz: it feels bad
[0:26:40] malvarcla: but mages are unkillable after the armor buff Kappa
[0:26:41] lordelenath: i mean nobody really tried, right? did hoolibang run into a single MLD?
[0:26:49] kyaii: not a single team played double caster last week right?
[0:26:50] filthyzx: triple melee
[0:26:52] ATHLTE: on NA right?
[0:26:52] Pajcsi: @filthyzx best kind of meta, who wants to play against frost mage + lock + restodruid
[0:26:53] filthyzx: xD
[0:26:56] nightmxz: Vanguards?

[0:27:03] uninspire: i wanna see RPS into the WW sub
[0:27:08] kreyzy8: kzfox
[0:27:08] filthyzx: @Pajcsi I dislike zug zug meta
[0:27:09] uninspire: spriest is prob a great tool into it
[0:27:09] nightmxz: kzfox?
[0:27:11] xdtai: @venruki do u think arms and fistweaver is good in 2s?
[0:27:17] kreyzy8: ya
[0:27:19] Aidenzx: kzfox and exis
[0:27:19] schdenfreude: @trainingbot6 4 set 100%
[0:27:20] Mhortai: @venruki I am playing in the EU cup later. My comp is Disc/Ret/Bear (cuz that is what the people on my team play LOL)
[0:27:26] Mhortai: *na cup
[0:27:26] gr_faux: new hero talents posted
[0:27:27] ATHLTE: pretty much lmao
[0:27:36] lordelenath: @filthyzx outside of low-mid rated solo shuffle this meta doesnt feel very zug-zug.
[0:27:40] indrah___: @gr_faux where did they post it?
[0:27:42] figurines: @Mhortai cant wait to see it lol
[0:27:42] zachgamegodx: i think the point he's making is that people are complaining about 50k dps outlaw rogue that dampens people when DH and WW are doing 120k dps
[0:27:47] voteforpedro064: funny how there is a legendary 2h axe and the classes aren’t good enough to make it viable in awc.
[0:27:54] filthyzx: @lordelenath i think it feels super zug zug at all ratings, including high.
[0:27:56] uninspire: wym? warr is amazing
[0:28:03] Mhortai: @figurines It won;t go well lol. Just 3 of us doing it for the banner lol.
[0:28:05] uninspire: and there was a dk team last week but they didnt make it past quarters
[0:28:06] gr_faux: @indrah___ i found it on wowhead
[0:28:10] Saitistreamy: @voteforpedro064 they just tuned the axe to not be insane in 3s
[0:28:12] Pajcsi: @lordelenath agree, they just say this cus this only WW + sub team wrecking everyone
[0:28:13] Saitistreamy: thats a good thing
[0:28:24] indrah___: @gr_faux ty sir!
[0:28:29] filthyzx: LMFAO
[0:28:30] lordelenath: @Pajcsi and even that isn't "zug zug" to me, is it? its a lot of target switching and setup.
[0:28:33] kreyzy8: lmao he forgot to turn notifications off
[0:28:39] filthyzx: the sub sound
[0:28:40] filthyzx: is so good
[0:28:45] Saitistreamy: @lordelenath the meta is in fact zug zug, but if you arent a top tier zugger, your zug will only slug
[0:28:55] Jubite: bicmex so calm, rat is trapped in a cage
[0:28:57] filthyzx: @lordelenath I mean, when i say zug zug i mean zug zug, not ww sub
[0:29:09] it_weez: bicmexGoose bicmexSus bicmexSus
[0:29:10] uninspire: hes sick at the traps while theyre stacked
[0:29:13] Pajcsi: @lordelenath totally agree, whole team is enabling WW, sub barely do any damage, it's far from zugzug
[0:29:23] CKBandit: This team has a career as cattle auctioneers if the arena doesn't work out
[0:29:28] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy gr_faux WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:29:41] OGTweeter: its a lot of echoes
[0:29:53] uninspire: see its so stupid hard to kill someone
[0:29:54] StreetBlades: I played some 2s with him during SL on my shaman. He is the such a cool and calm person.
[0:29:58] uninspire: WW just across the map
[0:29:59] likeewlock: sure
[0:29:59] lordelenath: eradas is just too good. I've seen WWs die like dogs, but he just lives and lives and lives.
[0:30:19] uninspire: jay still has all buttons almost
[0:30:24] dailyshuffle: really close game now
[0:30:55] Pajcsi: it's so stupid the last week winners has to qualify again tho, makes no sense to me
[0:31:26] filthyzx: @Pajcsi why not? You want last weeks winners to just automatically go on in a new tournament? :o
[0:31:26] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The Best Specs In Dragonflight PvP Right Now" view it here: youtu.be/-WB0Pe8nKKo

[0:31:56] yuiop_rob: thats one clean UI
[0:32:21] Pajcsi: @filthyzx no, but a seed in top8 would be logical, literally winner has like +10 points than 2nd team, that's nothing, but this is just my opinion, i can be wrong
[0:32:26] Saitistreamy: the hero talents hint at a mage rework
[0:32:29] demololtv: rat is aware LOL
[0:32:38] uninspire: JESUS that burst while priest was angel
[0:32:41] uninspire: still almost killed
[0:32:41] Saitistreamy: no way they dropped a tree focused on casting other school spells without bigger changes to mage
[0:32:48] artagore: They just denying all their go it's hard to watch

[0:34:42] Jubite: little cap
[0:34:43] lordelenath: @Pajcsi thats just the regular EU > NA skill gap
[0:34:45] Polifilla: lol some poeple
[0:34:46] uninspire: bro the move is the hypest team to watch its unreal
[0:34:53] SwiisH_Tv: the Liquid vs Move finals was insane
[0:34:55] azliaris1: @venruki have you seen the new hero talents on wowhead
[0:34:56] sind233: ngl cheering for teams that can beat echo, can they beat echo?
[0:35:00] moldybread00: are u pumped for crusaders team @venruki
[0:35:01] jfeliciano007: Their graphics look like shit. Damn Europeans
[0:35:01] betzolo: its fast pace games i love it :D
[0:35:04] Pajcsi: @lordelenath true, plus EU not flooded with outlaws that much
[0:35:05] Polifilla: liquid vs move both games were sick
[0:35:10] jdot117: there are way too many games to stream them all no?
[0:35:12] Aresue: I love it
[0:35:13] pr1me1989: who do you cheer for, Ven?
[0:35:14] uninspire: honestly kinda prefer this, just wish some of the bigger streamers werent actually playing the matches and could stream
[0:35:17] AsdOfc: its convenient for you ofc
[0:35:26] crymorre: @jdot117 yep too many simultaneous matches
[0:35:27] SirBeaverTeeth: mvq playing echo now
[0:35:30] SirBeaverTeeth: D;
[0:35:31] Pajcsi: @Polifilla after first 7 minutes passed yeah
[0:35:37] DegStaerian: THIS IS the official stream!
[0:35:42] mettakilla2: Rat is so insane lol, all they've been talking about is how they're eye is twitching and I guess Rat drinka 4 liters of Pepsi Max a day.
[0:35:45] Hoodwinkel: we couldnt tell
[0:35:50] OGTweeter: so they can’t stream during the official stream?
[0:35:50] lordelenath: @Polifilla yeah, but feels like they're so much better than everyone else. Didnt both go almost 0 losses outside of their series against each other?
[0:35:54] bokioz: The wow channel could stream the POVs, and you could like host the stream u see
[0:35:55] demololtv: how does bicmex have that sheep staff
[0:35:57] hiighigan: LETS GO BICMEX!!!!

[0:36:07] Juewellez: it’s to build up the streamers not just the wow streaming channel
[0:36:07] gr_faux: SV hunter is fun to watch, bicmex is just a bonus
[0:36:09] HeyHero: @venruki what is this "watch party"?

[0:36:43] bigislandcoconuts: is priest streaming
[0:36:44] pr1me1989: Survival vs BM. which one is better for arena?
[0:36:46] lordelenath: the only thing I'm missing is the commentary. I need a professional to explain to me whats happening @venruki . I'm to noob by myself.
[0:36:48] sind233: Its fine guys its just first game
[0:36:55] sind233: This is last game

[0:38:53] zachgamegodx: games all damn day
[0:38:54] tautvydas248: can you maybe plug mvq stream as well?
[0:38:56] ItsJhelo: Does the AWC limit what gear and such can be worn, enchants, etc. Or is it just gear as much as you can
[0:39:09] lordelenath: can you provide more commentary on whats actualyl happening @venruki? I'm too stupid to understand whats happening without a professional explaining it to me.
[0:39:16] Mhortai: @ItsJhelo You can get everything
[0:39:25] Kiwle: is lontar new healer for echo?
[0:39:26] uninspire: comms >>
[0:39:30] YoMamaSoFine69: save your voice for the weakend
[0:39:32] SwiisH_Tv: yeah comms are my favorite honestly
[0:39:33] zachgamegodx: i saved the mage tree for u to explain it to us
[0:39:34] ATHLTE: @uninspire yea

[0:39:35] skyhath: ye comms are nice to listen to

[0:40:04] cruelhabbitts: nope
[0:40:04] ZhangTuShi: not as much as i thought though
[0:40:04] Rabaraux: nooo
[0:40:05] uninspire: yeah called off work lmao
[0:40:05] rivellana: nope
[0:40:06] bokioz: nah im retail pvp player
[0:40:07] bjak_: Is this the first match with these two teams? or have they done aa couple?
[0:40:09] dickman911: excited is a strong word
[0:40:09] Lazarinth: No
[0:40:11] lordelenath: is it intentional or stress that all the pros say everything 2-3 times?
[0:40:13] krisdahaka: N OMEGALUL
[0:40:14] dickman911: gonna try it tho
[0:40:14] Tyferious: @venruki Can you describe your pvp career did you ever get stuck at a lower rating for awhile. How did you finally get out of it?
[0:40:27] vortex071232: how you doing today Venruike!
[0:40:27] SwiisH_Tv: ill have fun in stv for a week then be off it lol
[0:40:28] Applezbtw: ven with the bait LUL
[0:40:33] betasoldier: You mean the night I spam solo shuffle while my friends level in SoD?
[0:40:33] Tekaes: luuxiaCefor
[0:40:39] bjak_: Is this game 1?
[0:40:54] OGTweeter: no, i play and enjoy retail
[0:40:54] RedeemedbyJesus: I just wish they'd dump resources into making SS queue times better somehow. Can't decide if I want to keep a wow sub, 30-40 min dps queues or healing torture are lame options.
[0:40:56] UncleCringeDance: if everyone says everything 3x, is that more efficient than if everyone says everything 1x
[0:40:57] micaiasf: @lordelenath gouge gouge gouge, you fine you fine you fine
[0:40:57] lordelenath: Chan just too good man.
[0:41:04] dotf_lv: Hello. Where I can find current results?
[0:41:06] uninspire: SOD gonna be the same insane hype for like 2 months then we can come back for next wow season ez
[0:41:13] Tekaes: they trained way more this week, luuxia and co
[0:41:22] aseiadk: does wow do class changes during tournaments?
[0:41:23] Vramii: are we far enough in yet that anyone has already qualified for the stuff tomorrow/ friday?
[0:41:28] NerdEngineering: I'm curious to see if Echo is able to make changes and bounce back in a strong way.
[0:41:28] Kiwle: is mehh not on echo anymore?
[0:41:31] SwiisH_Tv: didnt Jaime get exposed for cheating tho?
[0:41:42] heymomimonttv: @SwiisH_Tv no, it's all he said she said
[0:41:43] NiborWoW: @Kiwle Mehh not competing in 2024
[0:41:55] Kiwle: i see
[0:42:04] uninspire: homie got the stockholm syndrome wanting a dh to win
[0:42:08] ZhangTuShi: i feel the same. i usually want chan to win but watching mvq all the sudden i feel differently
[0:42:11] aseiadk: youre an empath ven
[0:42:13] pr1me1989: their druid are soon oom. r shaman at 50% mana
[0:42:18] heymomimonttv: and at this point, with how wizk killed the spirit link instantly, im thinking it's possible for jaime to make some of the plays he makes
[0:42:20] nightmxz: I think sub might still be the best rogue spec LUL
[0:42:21] Kujo_XX: It's the UI layout
[0:42:24] krisdahaka: OFC LOL
[0:42:25] SquidSosa: they do more dam thats for sure lol
[0:42:25] f3elsok: ye
[0:42:25] Arty2191: lol by far
[0:42:26] Carcer69: both should not be a thing
[0:42:27] michxxlh: both are fucked
[0:42:29] SaltyBites: way worse
[0:42:29] ZhangTuShi: i hate outlaw more
[0:42:29] krisdahaka: i mean
[0:42:30] fistweaveurnan: Anything under r1 level yes they are worse
[0:42:31] heymomimonttv: i think DH is way worse than outlaw
[0:42:31] ATHLTE: they;re both abominations lolol but outlaw is worse
[0:42:32] ItsJhelo: DH is not worse than rogue
[0:42:32] f3elsok: dh takes 0 skill
[0:42:33] leeka: DH = outlaw = Ww. hate them all
[0:42:33] Applezbtw: outlaw is way more oppressive
[0:42:34] chaps_86: i hate dh more
[0:42:36] lordelenath: @SwiisH_Tv I just dont want rdruids to win.
[0:42:36] infraredpen: DHs are cool
[0:42:37] uninspire: outlaw may be an equally STRONG spec, but DH more despicable
[0:42:38] ItsJhelo: prolly even
[0:42:39] Kikrino: Hate is a strong word Ven
[0:42:42] artagore: I'm for Whaazz team ngl, even if it's cool that an another team won, i'm sad that they lost last tourny
[0:42:44] sind233: Rogue is worse
[0:42:48] Jubite: anyone can pump on DH, good players pump on outlaw
[0:42:48] NerdEngineering: I feel like DH is finally in a decent spot
[0:42:49] sind233: FOr sure
[0:42:50] Pajcsi: @leeka i hate demo the most :P
[0:42:50] krisdahaka: there's an outlaw in the enemy team, you can't want outlaw to win
[0:42:53] ItsJhelo: at a high level tho I feel like DH gets slammed by many comps
[0:42:54] pr1me1989: druid is oom
[0:42:54] Sosatko: outlaw is worse but dh is 3 buttons
[0:42:55] NerdEngineering: for too long they're either gods or trash
[0:42:55] betasoldier: A Demon Hunter kills me fast but I at least get to play the game.
[0:42:57] likeewlock: I hate DH more because less ppl play outlaw
[0:42:57] pr1me1989: r shaman have more mana
[0:43:00] Saitistreamy: People dont hate outlaw, because in low to mid CR outlaw isnt a issue
[0:43:01] fistweaveurnan: Outlaws at awc level are on a completely different floor than outlaws even at 2.4 right now
[0:43:06] Saitistreamy: Outlaw is just a high CR terror
[0:43:08] leeka: @Pajcsi good thing its 99% melee in 3s :)
[0:43:28] ATHLTE: ooof mana game now
[0:43:32] fistweaveurnan: DH being immortal and having the highest sustain in game is plaguing every bracket from 0 to 2.7
[0:43:35] tmha0: meta kidney, meld kidney and trinket kidney in 3 globals KEKW
[0:43:38] zachgamegodx: he tried to backflip, meta, and meld kidney
[0:43:41] QwQGolden: DH deserves the hate they get - full of ego tripping 1600's, absolute mongo class, just like DKs got hate when they came out. Its all deserved.
[0:43:41] zachgamegodx: and missed all 3
[0:43:44] zachgamegodx: thats teh power of dh
[0:43:45] infraredpen: DH looks so fun
[0:43:47] dailyshuffle: lontar is almost oom
[0:43:51] infraredpen: flying and flipping around
[0:43:51] malvarcla: dont like jaime but want whazz to lose too tbh lol
[0:43:54] RedeemedbyJesus: I feel like DH = carpal tunnel in one game with how long a round lasts nowadays
[0:43:54] artagore: Lontar oom
[0:43:54] lordelenath: I queued 3 aff lock solo shuffles today, all of them into triple melee. Please say something to make me feel better @venruki
[0:44:09] SquidSosa: L
[0:44:10] indrah___: i love DH i just hate meta form LUL
[0:44:22] heymomimonttv: @lordelenath youll get that on these big jobs
[0:44:22] NerdEngineering: good lord
[0:44:22] lordelenath: yeah, but it happens ALL THE TIME
[0:44:29] moldybread00: NO ONE feels bad when aff faces all casters lmao ull be alright
[0:44:29] SwiisH_Tv: Love me son Chan <3
[0:44:31] Sosatko: I press blade dance enemy goes from 80-20 😂
[0:44:32] NerdEngineering: Chan is a monster, that SM blocking the hunt
[0:44:33] vortex071232: how hard is outlaw to play_
[0:44:34] michxxlh: 2.3+ every ss has a outlaw now
[0:44:35] firststagepizza: chan meld the hunt
[0:44:37] SquidSosa: or hunter
[0:44:39] michxxlh: its not cool lol
[0:44:43] uninspire: i feel like the worst mage lobbies are the 4 casters for me
[0:44:48] flennx: yesterday i had arcane mage into bm hunter/dh/ele/double rshaman was fun as well LUL
[0:44:49] Jubite: blue bar gg
[0:44:53] hiighigan: best way to counter outlaw?
[0:45:01] ZhangTuShi: rough
[0:45:02] SaltyBites: yaaay
[0:45:06] pr1me1989: i knew it, druids mana are burning like hell!!!!
[0:45:07] diosilvl: rdru detected, high damp expected
[0:45:10] rogast46: @hiighigan play paladin :D
[0:45:16] chaps_86: @hiighigan play outlaw =P
[0:45:26] NerdEngineering: if you didn't see Chan on his stream with his quirky sense of humor, I'd be convinced he was an AI.
[0:45:34] Saitistreamy: mage is 100% getting reworked
[0:45:37] Saitistreamy: based off the class
[0:45:43] pr1me1989: @Saitistreamy when????
[0:45:51] Zuterloo: resto-balance seems lackluster imo, going on to BM hunter druid way lol
[0:46:02] Saitistreamy: @pr1me1989 the amount of spell school overlap makes little sense with current design
[0:46:08] themightyroach: i hate rdruid is want them to  lose instantly
[0:46:11] pr1me1989: guys, BM vs Survival. For high MR. which one?

[0:46:13] NerdEngineering: back to borrowed power per expac
[0:46:13] Carcer69: damn frostfire back
[0:46:26] MazzMos: Things are already a bit confusing. I just came back and all these dragon glyphs and shit feel overly confusing for no reason
[0:46:32] lordelenath: honestly, they obv think this makes it easier but I think it's gonne be even harder to balance than before. its gonna be a nightmare.
[0:46:33] Mhortai: @NerdEngineering Hero Talents are ever green. Not just for WW
[0:46:33] Vramii: @NerdEngineering wrong
[0:46:35] jdickson93: i miss cross-spec stuff, its what i liked about the old classic talent tree
[0:46:39] jdickson93: jdickson93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months, currently on a 46 month streak! 
[0:46:49] heymomimonttv: @MazzMos the dragon glyph is literally only for dragon flying. hope this clears things up for you
[0:46:55] Carcer69: @MazzMos arent dragon glyphs only for dragon riding?
[0:47:11] chaps_86: @pr1me1989 it depends on the comp. survival has more burst which is good with sub/feral. Bm is more sustain dmg which is good with dk/demo/ret/war
[0:47:17] vortex071232: thats sick ngl
[0:47:20] heymomimonttv: @Carcer69 yea lol literally the least confusing thing about the current xpac
[0:47:25] vortex071232: looking forawrd to seeing the talent system
[0:47:28] diosilvl: inb4 tanks too op in pvp
[0:47:34] vmills: seems fun af honestly, super excited
[0:47:42] betasoldier: yes, you get all talents, but there are a few choice nodes
[0:47:43] uninspire: yeah you get every talent, they said that at blizzcon
[0:47:49] waelrick: there a few choices though
[0:47:50] nightmxz: It's kinda like PoE ascendancies
[0:47:55] SquidSosa: ye they described it as another evergreen feature
[0:47:58] Cafe0le: tank expansion inc YEP
[0:48:03] Sosatko: It seems cool but it feels they are making it harder and more confusing for new players lol
[0:48:07] chaps_86: @pr1me1989 also, surival is 10x the fun of bm imo
[0:48:08] Carcer69: @heymomimonttv I mean I dont think there is anything really confusing except maybe gear crafting but there you have crafting orders for best gearing system in a while
[0:48:25] zerx_gg: are they crunching the numbers again next expansion or are we going multi millions
[0:48:25] BrokenEarBank: not sure how I feel about priest oracle tree
[0:48:31] fistweaveurnan: Sweet cool a new system to google what BiS is an pick that
[0:48:38] heymomimonttv: @Carcer69 i agree 100%. i came to dragonflight from wotlk classic and thought it was 100% easier to navigate the game and the things in the game
[0:48:47] Ribastur0075: dark ranger sounds cool at leat one tree

[0:56:08] jamesip87: when is the new expansion out.

[0:56:09] wackpoetic: Game needs to be getting simpler not more complex
[0:56:11] Aggro068: Kinda weird, could be cool. Adding a lot more stuff to learn between all the spec combos
[0:56:12] lightsflux: I like it but yeah the aoe stuff makes me think their will only be one route for PvP

[0:57:00] themightyroach: burrowed power are a mess every time and as we progress in season it gets harder for blizzard to balance pvp and pve at the same time and we ALL know what it means for pvp...

[0:58:21] D_Tram: @themightyroach were done with borrowed power my guy.. but you are right it will be tough to balance everything with these.. the only way they can completely  seperate pvp and pve is by making every ability on every class have a pvp or pve tool tip and they can change them seperately from one another.. they wont do this tho
[0:58:23] shugguls: dh damage nurd and Lock dark pack nurf
[0:58:27] BCboy_: i predict alot of class tuning before the big cross region tournament

[1:09:00] Leredi: did they make any trouble, like 30% hp for enemy?
[1:09:00] heymomimonttv: yup
[1:09:04] uninspire: i wanna see thug win so bad
[1:09:07] ihazeri: you need skill for outlaw, not for dh imo
[1:09:09] krisdahaka: it was never the case
[1:09:12] kreyzy8: that's just what EU thinks
[1:09:13] dailyshuffle: the wl was unkillable like a tank :O
[1:09:14] lordelenath: @venruki, what do you think about disabling drinking in arena? it would solve so many issues and shit that nobody enjoys imo.
[1:09:14] Jubite: the bar is lower on DH to be oppressive
[1:09:18] uninspire: against rls yeah
[1:09:18] mrmsix6: why would anyone play a melee other than rogue?
[1:09:20] tedstaTV: lol demo/bm/outlaw all annoying

[1:09:29] heymomimonttv: @ihazeri yea like a bad outlaw is easy to beat. bad dh still facerolls over alot of things
[1:09:29] FateIRL: a 1200 dh does as much dam as a 2800 dh
[1:09:29] lightsflux: yeah I’m rooting for bicmex for sure
[1:09:31] Revan06a: I think outlaw takes more skill to play then DH
[1:09:32] varok87: Look at the Outlaw Rogues about 2400 in SS then look at the DH above 2400 in SS.
[1:09:33] YoMamaSoFine69: they would win so much more if they would change to mm/bm or outlaw
[1:09:36] chezjek: outlaw way more aids to fight than dh as a mage
[1:09:43] Carcer69: @venruki Is na also today?
[1:09:46] xilyx2: @FateIRL thats def not true lol
[1:09:53] Carcer69: nice
[1:09:56] heymomimonttv: @xilyx2 1400-2400 is true tho
[1:09:57] jporter_: Ven, how do i track my battle mender title?

[1:10:13] uninspire: @heymomimonttv actually it is statistically true that they do lol
[1:10:16] lordelenath: @atarri1 the answer is always THE MOVE
[1:10:24] ihazeri: @heymomimonttv i agree, if if youi mess up, your dmg is carrying as dh
[1:10:25] heymomimonttv: @xilyx2 it's statistically proven
[1:10:26] bigislandcoconuts: are there any healers streaming
[1:10:36] tmha0: liquid makes it very hard to cheer for them KEKW
[1:10:39] uninspire: watching the move v cdew is so hard
[1:10:51] lordelenath: its not like the caster influences the game
[1:11:00] lightsflux: wizk has put spriest on the map for sure I’ve seen so many more now queueing lmao
[1:11:11] uninspire: raiku been practicing sp! i wanna see it so bad!

[1:11:14] heymomimonttv: @uninspire 1200-2800 no, 1400-2400 yes
[1:11:17] Carcer69: there is a godtier clip of a biased football caster
[1:11:18] flalia4: Is there a team you root for to lose then instead?
[1:11:19] jamesip87: why are you never in it?
[1:11:31] zachgamegodx: @jamesip87 he was in it a decade ago

[1:11:39] HoodsShadow: lies, there are only 3 amigos and u must cheer for them
[1:11:39] rawrces: is there a link we can view the open bracket results?
[1:11:44] FKNweebstv: when he remembered to block
[1:11:44] Cafe0le: whatching the players pov with personalized uis with comms feels more hype than the usual awc cast imo
[1:11:46] FKNweebstv: kekekkeke
[1:11:48] bokioz: I love that bicmex is sharing UI etc for free

[1:15:45] elmarkello: HOOOLIBANG win?
[1:15:47] FKNweebstv: i play outlaw thug with pres, feels sooooo nice tbh
[1:15:49] uninspire: eeeee bomb on tide
[1:15:51] eEpzi: but generaly speaking would outlaw in this comp be better ?
[1:16:12] heymomimonttv: @eEpzi in almost every comp (including this one), yea prob
[1:16:19] lightsflux: rat LUL
[1:16:30] uninspire: someone ask rat about his tempo
[1:16:35] Cyndren99: zenlynSob "I have no tempo" zenlynSob
[1:16:36] Applezbtw: why do u think they are goin for rogue instead of lock in this match up?
[1:16:42] allport22: OMG rat is annoying as fuck
[1:16:43] lordelenath: rat sounds slightly tilted
[1:16:50] uninspire: rat is just passionate
[1:16:50] Vramii: dud Rat strssed me out
[1:16:51] moldybread00: lmao i love how they both sooth him to avoid throwing mid go
[1:16:52] Leanadle: Lock cc chain is insane
[1:16:54] Cyndren99: @lordelenath He's always tilted
[1:16:57] yesayax: rat is always tilted xD
[1:16:59] Carcer69: I swear I cant take britts that rage serious haha
[1:17:00] uninspire: facts gotta be invested
[1:17:01] lordelenath: you cant excuse everything with "passionate", sorry man.
[1:17:01] xilyx2: eh
[1:17:02] bjak_: how come theres such a mana difference? Is it just classes?
[1:17:04] chezjek: people caring about things is annoying madge
[1:17:06] schdenfreude: He's not tilted he's just British
[1:17:07] Carcer69: its so goofy with the accent
[1:17:14] uninspire: hes just british? LMFAO
[1:17:15] doclovejr: most sane rogue main lol
[1:17:19] Vramii: yeah but he's the scary kind of passionate haha
[1:17:21] Cafe0le: is he related to joe
[1:17:22] Jubite: chill
[1:17:25] uninspire: rogues use energy bois
[1:17:25] lightsflux: “chill” LUL

[1:17:46] deadlyrexy: Need fiends to win AWC just so Rat can get interviewed >:D
[1:17:57] FKNweebstv: its like supateease said, resto sham is a camel
[1:18:00] lightsflux: couldn’t they do some goes on sham or is that a bad idea?
[1:18:02] eli_sundayx: Do you know when NA starts?
[1:18:04] hunchurio: rat gonna die for sure
[1:18:06] Vramii: put Rat and crusader on the same team please. Want to see it so bad
[1:18:08] heymomimonttv: lmao they'd interview bicmex or zenlyn before they interviewed rat
[1:18:19] crazydog64: we need caster ven
[1:18:23] wisptroll: mex 100
[1:18:23] uninspire: thug is a low dmg comp in general, so all healers gonna out mana them prob
[1:18:24] lordelenath: @Vramii at least they deserve each other i guess.
[1:18:26] xilyx2: they have a condition now wow
[1:18:27] Kujo_XX: Mana game is so tilted
[1:18:28] Leanadle: @Leredi priest 5% mana sweating LUL
[1:18:29] Sosatko: shaman mana is ridiculous tbh lol
[1:18:33] DrakziIIa: ven doesn't work for free
[1:18:35] Sosatko: that class can heal forever
[1:18:38] moldybread00: too many casters in the kitchen ruins the soup
[1:18:39] bokioz: @PaperTaper xD
[1:18:39] soddi: the comms are intense
[1:18:42] xilyx2: there it is
[1:18:42] uninspire: YOOOOOOO
[1:18:43] artagore: gg
[1:18:45] heymomimonttv: wowwwwwww
[1:18:45] artagore: Nice
[1:18:45] lightsflux: LFG
[1:18:47] uninspire: RAT FOUND THE TMPO
[1:18:47] kreyzy8: EZ
[1:18:48] dankgamer97: Holy F KEKW
[1:18:48] deadlyrexy: @heymomimonttv let a man dream :(
[1:18:49] crazydog64: WOW
[1:18:52] xilyx2: that was .. nice turn around lol
[1:18:53] Cyndren99: "KILL THIS DOG" hahaha
[1:18:53] Aidenzx: Hpriest new meta :o
[1:18:53] SquidSosa: do you think they beat echo now
[1:18:54] jporter_: this team is so loveable
[1:18:54] heymomimonttv: zen oom and they still secured the win
[1:18:55] Carcer69: @lordelenath nah the rat guy is just tilted the last cup crusader was making rl threats to his mates
[1:18:57] nyksinia: RAT LETS GOOO
[1:18:57] D_Tram: LETS GOOOOO
[1:18:58] Popsycle: Rat is great love watching it
[1:19:04] Cafe0le: why cant we have some comms in the awc @venruki
[1:19:07] IamWalnuts: i mean zen was oom there
[1:19:07] holyswag89: if u dont play like him u wont win anything
[1:19:09] Jubite: listening to rat feels like snorting a line
[1:19:14] lightsflux: he is tilted but he isn’t like a dick to his team so it’s hilarious
[1:19:16] Vramii: What would happen if Rat and Crusader were on the same team?
[1:19:16] pr1me1989: why didnt enemy team stall the time. HP was almost oom. Bad tactic
[1:19:17] IamWalnuts: if they didnt win on that go
[1:19:20] IamWalnuts: they just lose
[1:19:25] uninspire: yeah i think it works only in heavy setup comps that want to actually kill before oom
[1:19:25] lordelenath: @Carcer69 yeah, maybe. I#m just tired of the gaming community making excuses for toxic ppl to be honest. Its not passion when you're just flaming everyone. its being an asshole.
[1:19:26] IamWalnuts: cause hpriest mana
[1:19:26] shogun2022: casters are better you guys rock
[1:19:26] Symo85: coms give me anxiety
[1:19:37] bokioz: how did fusetons team do
[1:19:46] FKNweebstv: i prefer coms over casters
[1:19:46] hiighigan: wheres the score ladder for all this?
[1:19:48] moldybread00: save ur
[1:19:48] DoYouWannaHug: Listen ins are good
[1:19:49] moldybread00: energy
[1:19:50] FKNweebstv: personally
[1:19:52] heymomimonttv: i like casters better than comms for the big games
[1:19:53] atarri1: Their comp seems way fun to play
[1:19:53] uninspire: rat wasnt flaming, he was saying he was behind on offense and calling tempo
[1:19:57] uninspire: hes not shit talking
[1:19:58] moldybread00: let hium watch it as a fan
[1:19:59] moldybread00: XD
[1:20:04] matt_caste: You don't want to do your job on your day off for free?
[1:20:13] Pillahump: it would be cool for AWC after a win if they highlight the teams comms right before the kill or something.
[1:20:22] uninspire: sub is so much more fun to watch than outlaw
[1:20:24] irlEric: theres another AWC this weekend?!
[1:20:27] Carcer69: @lordelenath who was he flaming? it just seemed that he was tilted
[1:20:28] IamWalnuts: as unlikely as it would be a Hooli vs Fiends final would be hype
[1:20:29] Cafe0le: but i love the casting too, just think the comms add a bit more hype and grit
[1:20:33] IamWalnuts: those were the best games of the day
[1:20:34] Slitelohel: Sub just feels weird.
[1:20:35] Jubite: do we have any true RMP teams left competing?
[1:20:51] ATHLTE: agreed
[1:20:53] applesauce399: @venruki sup qt
[1:20:55] lordelenath: @Carcer69 probably too much crusader still on my mind, youre right he wasnt flaming
[1:20:57] Blitzylive: $$$$$
[1:20:58] dornes97: coms are great
[1:20:59] moldybread00: no they should totally do it, more resources into awc the better
[1:21:01] Symo85: that's why i can't watch crusader or joe fernandes
[1:21:05] Kujo_XX: Is it best of 3?
[1:21:06] uninspire: did u guys see howton was running echoing reprimand? i think after the evis nerfs he was runnign a cheesey extra burst build to offset
[1:21:17] heymomimonttv: there's too many games happening at the same time for 1 stream. and if they played 1 game at a time the open brackets would take 2-3 days
[1:21:19] flawfox: @Jubite Crusader, Hansol and Palumor prob gonna play rmpala this cup
[1:21:45] shogun2022: locks are such livelords right now
[1:21:48] moldybread00: they stopped flying players and casters out, paying for room/board/travel, studio equipment, the casters are their own production team atm, they can afford to stream weeklly qualifiers lol
[1:21:56] Jubite: Also flare takes away a lot of the rogue outs
[1:21:59] moldybread00: if theyre half into esports so will the audience be half into their show
[1:22:04] FKNweebstv: locks only rly diee vs casters rn imo
[1:22:10] FKNweebstv: even then its hard
[1:22:14] xilyx2: rogue is killable with flare and another rogue
[1:22:16] UncleCringeDance: how does survival hunter..survive? they have like no defenses
[1:22:23] bigislandcoconuts: @venruki is there any healers that are streaming this
[1:22:27] lordelenath: @moldybread00 I mean, microsoft has to continue it's 45%+ margin. they would co broke otherwise.
[1:22:34] moldybread00: XD
[1:22:37] Boruox: Rat has good comms!
[1:22:39] wackpoetic: UncleCringeDance Bicmex
[1:22:46] Leanadle: trap broke
[1:22:52] heymomimonttv: @UncleCringeDance kiting, and knowing when to go in for melee combat vs ranged combat
[1:22:54] gelatokush: started doing SS on my outlaw and i get targeted kite often even tho i have 45% vers an immortal :D
[1:22:54] moldybread00: the production team is extremely passionate in AWC imagine if it got proper resources
[1:23:00] kreyzy8: yeah he imp'd the last trap
[1:23:06] kreyzy8: unless it broke randomly
[1:23:22] moldybread00: play DH no one bothers targeting u unless theyre desperate
[1:23:23] sind233: theres no way they win against echo xD
[1:23:49] moldybread00: Rat= Chipsa from OW
[1:23:55] uninspire: share thoughts!
[1:23:58] moldybread00: has anyone ever seen both of them in the same room
[1:24:05] smuuchx: feels like priest is really good with cleave comps
[1:24:12] lordelenath: upsi
[1:24:33] Sheepyou: its 170k not 200k Kappa
[1:24:35] Ultratoasted: Beast
[1:24:46] Jubite: got the take stick
[1:24:51] lordelenath: why are you holding a dildo in your hand when you give us a take?
[1:25:04] heymomimonttv: ven ima let you finish but there's too many games happening at the same time for 1 stream. and if they played 1 game at a time the open brackets would take 2-3 days
[1:25:04] moldybread00: that is true
[1:25:16] HydroSplat: i think not casting it gives the streamers a better chance for more viewers
[1:25:18] uninspire: LCS and league show this point a lot, nobody tunes in until end of season
[1:25:20] HydroSplat: i like that these aren't casted
[1:25:26] Hoodwinkel: wow there is no such thing, only in CS and lol
[1:25:29] jporter_: rogues are the cause of my viewer fatigue
[1:25:30] ATHLTE: and a break for you guys lol
[1:25:30] SaltyBites: agree
[1:25:33] moldybread00: ok, maybe not streaming it but they should pay u 3 to have a weekly show where u podcast upcoming matchups and share thoughts/predictions
[1:25:34] yesayax: true, this format is great
[1:25:34] Jubite: even just having back to back AWC weekends feels like a lot
[1:25:37] moldybread00: it would build hype
[1:25:46] allport22: It would be cool if they put out like a 'round up' vid - where they put a vod together of the best mid week games
[1:25:48] immakeepcominback: !bracket
[1:25:50] FateIRL: they reduced downtime between games in awc makes it better to watch
[1:25:50] Nightbot: https://raider.io/events/awc-dragonflight-season-3-cup-2-europe/brackets/open-bracket
[1:25:51] Hoodwinkel: wow is like once a year
[1:25:51] Vramii: in real life sports they did try to do evens with just players miced up and no announcers. It flopped, but maybe this is different
[1:25:52] moldybread00: can even do highlights from last week
[1:25:52] lordelenath: i have "being stunned by rogues"-fatigue. How do i deal with that?
[1:25:52] Granchiz: How did he get that staff transmorg ? LUL
[1:25:54] smuuchx: csgo took a big hit in like 2015/2016 when there were so many tourneys and streams nobody watched it for a while before they basically went back to big tourneys again
[1:25:58] ImFromTheFuture: Would be cool if they mixed in some team comms on the casts.
[1:26:02] stayawayfrom: league is the same game for 10 years now lol
[1:26:07] stayawayfrom: better to watch read headlines then watch games
[1:26:13] sind233: @lordelenath my msft stock go brrrrr
[1:26:15] allport22: It would be cool if they put out like a 'round up' vid - where they put a vod together of the best mid week games.
[1:26:18] jporter_: yeah watching rogue over and over is very boring but is what it it is lol
[1:26:23] irlEric: do the move and liquid play in the open round or are they guaranteed a spot?
[1:26:30] HydroSplat: i've def starting following more people on twitch because of these viewing parties
[1:26:31] applesauce399: big fan of community run esports.
[1:26:37] Thirlix: Tournament team GS 5800 reg
[1:26:41] xilyx2: first series was way worse for them
[1:26:44] SaltyBites: he had weighted clothing
[1:26:46] Jubite: orc characters are fresh i think
[1:26:47] lordelenath: @irlEric new cup, new open rounds. so they're playing.
[1:26:49] heymomimonttv: lol i remember doing that before raiding in wotlk classic. everyone had to inspect my gear cuz it was the first time i was ever raiding
[1:26:53] uninspire: Honestly kinda true though, showing up unprepared is rough
[1:26:54] face2face: Nethy and cassidy won and are gonna play vs mvq now

[1:28:09] betasoldier: One of my M+ party members did the first half of the season without enchants on his gear, but he took extra care to make sure his SoD character was all enchanted. Made me mad.

[1:30:49] flalia4: Damn Hoolibang already got knocked out?
[1:30:50] Cafe0le: PauseChamp
[1:30:57] lordelenath: @manbuttjuices its only because theres sooo many rogues.
[1:31:00] Salamander942: YOU MIGHT COMPETE???
[1:31:08] FateIRL: wizk swapped orc vs liquid and it worked out well
[1:31:11] uninspire: whaaz was saying outlaw rogue as orc is garbage because u absolutely need meld
[1:31:29] Carcer69: is anyone from chikabu streaming?

[1:31:39] Schwenkyytv: i cant get good enough value if shadowmeld to out perform the passive of orc racial
[1:31:41] goesidd: remember that pikaboo meld out of clone at 0%? meld was good
[1:31:42] SaltyBites: imagine complaining about orcs when nes exist
[1:31:43] cburo: honestly blink stun doesn't seem worth it when they can just connect 1 global later and restun (granted it is dr'd, but still)

[1:34:24] notoriousztv: lontar?
[1:34:31] shogun2022: I feel like with the current meta games just go on for a few minutes until someone more or less gets randomly one shot in a micro cc
[1:34:32] FateIRL: is azael still doing awc?
[1:34:33] allport22: echo kicking aside last week andd taking the weekend?
[1:34:38] Hizuru1: @gelatokush skill issue
[1:34:41] Salamander942: Xaryu
[1:34:43] lordelenath: @gelatokush the 4set is significantly nerfed for pvp, thats probably a big reason?
[1:34:48] face2face: Luuxia plays vs this warlock outlaw bicmex just lost to

[1:36:33] xilyx2: i feel like im in a turkish dance club
[1:36:36] Luksnbert: is the move also playing today?
[1:36:37] llseattlell: you should when you get a chance ask pika how he feels about everyones shit talking
[1:36:39] kreyzy8: there is still lower bracket games
[1:36:43] allport22: can you link the leaderboard pls?
[1:36:43] llseattlell: greatest rant ive ever heard.
[1:36:52] jporter_: Luuxia always oonce ooncing
[1:36:53] face2face: I think bicmex is gonna play vs hooligans in lower after next round
[1:36:55] uninspire: people were shit talking?
[1:37:07] llseattlell: everyones comparison of his damage etc. compared to trill
[1:37:08] gelatokush: i dont understand why people play feral dragon whats betetr about feral then other melees
[1:37:08] BMaStream: Nobody who matters is shit talking
[1:37:09] ryanblue98: they were saying his damage sucked
[1:37:10] uninspire: the move winning was just as hype as hoolibang winning, we were spoiled last cup
[1:37:15] Vallekk: people were shit talking his damage all last week until he won lol
[1:37:15] MegiiaBi: why shit talking?
[1:37:15] mettakilla2: Anyone else here playing in NA AWC today?
[1:37:20] Hizuru1: skill issue

[1:37:33] Yaycarrots: danD
[1:37:33] SquidSosa: for the most part lulw
[1:37:35] schdenfreude: @llseattlell watch his latest YouTube video, he kinda reacts to it
[1:37:37] lordelenath: I was actually there when he reacted to all the "low dps" shit by opening his details wanting to show how much more cc he did - and then it showed how he did the same amount of cc as the other rogues.
[1:37:40] lordelenath: it was hilarious.
[1:37:40] Cafe0le: OMEGALUL
[1:37:41] Psypew: you take that back pvp is parse city 69 llololol
[1:37:42] BMaStream: PvP isn't about the green bar, it's about the blue bar
[1:37:43] FateIRL: pika was getting double disarm, cloned all game
[1:37:43] VinnieK_: "he did less damage, he is washed"
[1:37:44] lordelenath: i love pika though, no flame!
[1:37:47] damian_blake: Whaaz says its only the dmg that matters
[1:37:48] uninspire: nah they cleared it up, the AWC details addon was upside down
[1:37:50] DegStaerian: but its longer
[1:37:51] Blitzylive: Why does every single pvper have dmg and healing meters always showing? lol
[1:37:53] dropbombsss: definitely a wizk diff
[1:37:55] face2face: Turns out physical dmg does less on boomies than on priests
[1:37:59] b_lappy: the worst are the warriors who thunderclap every pet in solo shuffle and bladestorm and think they should win because meters
[1:37:59] face2face: And you do less damage if you get cycloned
[1:38:02] Carcer69: I doubt whaazz said that
[1:38:03] OGTweeter: its weird! Its like if you live longer you win
[1:38:05] SaltyBites: having a guy with ahk on your team really helps
[1:38:05] artagore: There is so much toxicity during the last tourny in the chat made me real sad
[1:38:05] damian_blake: @venruki WIZK EZ
[1:38:06] allport22: wizk lol
[1:38:06] uninspire: whaaz lost pika won, question marks
[1:38:08] xilyx2: yea that seems fake
[1:38:10] gibboking: how did whazz get on lolololololol
[1:38:11] llseattlell: pika has brains trill go brr easiest way of putting it.
[1:38:12] ferahgok: Because Wizk made up for the damage lmao
[1:38:12] YouAint_VeryBusy: pika was disarmed 60% of the time
[1:38:13] Blitzylive: Pika says dmg meter was broken or outdated
[1:38:14] Hizuru1: washed up after bullying 1400 rated new players low dps
[1:38:18] FateIRL: nahj also says the game is pve and cc doesnt matter
[1:38:19] teribad: double disarm will do that
[1:38:20] holyswag89: NA LOVE DRAMA
[1:38:23] zeref_qq: lmfao
[1:38:24] holyswag89: GOD HAVE MERCY
[1:38:26] vortex071232: Yo whats up

[1:38:27] aitosoosi: @teribad triple
[1:38:31] SquidSosa: nahj also doesnt win lul
[1:38:32] uninspire: didnt see nahj in the finals weirdchamp
[1:38:34] bokioz: Pika said the dps meters was broken, is that true
[1:38:35] xilyx2: nahj does actually say that LUL
[1:38:35] lordelenath: honestly the shit talking of pika felt like humour and making fun to me, not actual flaming.
[1:38:36] shredder1111: if cc dont matter why ever team has rouge
[1:38:39] conman_91: conman_91 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Excited for AWC! Thanks for streaming these games today

[1:38:53] OGTweeter: then why was pikaboo cc’d the whole time, lol
[1:38:56] uninspire: pika is the fastest gun in the wets against links
[1:38:58] allport22: can you link the awc leaderboard thing showing the games please?
[1:38:59] Mhortai: Anytime some says CC doesn;t matter I question them a little lol
[1:39:00] uninspire: west
[1:39:02] face2face: Luuxia is so insane actually
[1:39:03] michaelss_: Whazz and nahh giving pov of rogues that lost
[1:39:05] llseattlell: in your opinion what is the scariest class on burst opener in an arena match?
[1:39:07] rockxtv: @shredder1111 exactly. it aint cause of their damage
[1:39:09] jporter_: Absterge static fields are so insane
[1:39:17] artagore: They say cc doesn't matter when in the same time play rogue and play around their cd, real troll
[1:39:18] applesauce399: that's wild someone basically said the opposite of hwo kills work in 3v3s. CC chains + priority damage >>>>>> zerg. Game only like that when stuff giga broken damage wise.
[1:39:18] K3tchup_33: If it were PvE then MWs would be the top healer for pumping HPS
[1:39:18] bigdam2024: man is in the zone
[1:39:20] wicked_wizurd: that clone didnt matter at all though Kappa
[1:39:24] Yaycarrots: and that's why DH/DK won the tournament danNodders
[1:39:25] allport22: @venruki can you link the awc leaderboard thing showing the games please?

[1:40:45] notdustinx: *pulls up cc done meter*
[1:40:50] Hizuru1: @nightmxz typical rogue main
[1:40:53] BMaStream: Comparing sub rogue damage to others is like comparing Aug evoker damage. Some moments it's high, but it shouldn't be top overall
[1:40:56] gelatokush: is it cuz of shuffle meta now peopel think dmg is all that matters cuz in ss it does matter more since u start in damp
[1:41:00] Aresue: is Hoolibang out or are they in the lower bracket for the cup on Friday?
[1:41:00] Sosatko: I saw that akro tweet lol it was so cringe

[1:41:11] valenti_No5: castin couch ruki OMEGAPOGGERS
[1:41:15] Boruox: oh ven you were suppose to tell us soemthing
[1:41:16] lordelenath: @notdustinx i suggest the "kicks done" meter, its always the most humilitating for ppl that pose with dps.
[1:41:19] flamingjob: U can do 10m damage as dh and the rogue spriest hit 2million at one go and win the game.
[1:41:20] shrimpsmacker: I still cant speak in public

[1:42:15] shtain3r: That's how it works???
[1:42:20] leeka: my wife points at the picture a lot lol
[1:42:20] applesauce399: practice, try acting/improv, just start talking to people in public and meeting eye contact. Always found it's like a muscle for me. More I do it the better I am at it. The less i do it the more i kinda feel "withered"
[1:42:21] zerx_gg: work in sales if you wanna learn how to people
[1:42:22] beeftip: Go into the speaking with the mindset of "Mind over matter, I don't mind because their opinions don't matter"

[1:43:33] D_Tram: love my healers man
[1:43:34] beeftip: Record your speeches, listen to them, count your um's, you'll start slowing down and focusing on what you say and not saying um. That's a big one
[1:43:40] lordelenath: thats why THE MOVE always wins. Absterge is the goat.
[1:43:50] shrimpsmacker: its like the goalie in hockey

[2:43:55] tipthescales117: Crusader just Said it himself that the priest was d shiet
[2:43:58] SquidSosa: do you think ret dh is good or is ret war better
[2:43:59] greatshampoo: the fact it should been 3-3 says something monk not using karma and priest not disordering in your side lol
[2:44:01] xdtai: lets see this
[2:44:02] 인터넷포트: ohh
[2:44:04] khaoskhanthedestroyer: ret/war letsgo

[2:48:18] aframpp: why did everyone stop playing it? it was meta for a while wasnt it

[2:48:26] allport22: I mean they lose to arcane outlaw no? so Fiends kinda unlucky
[2:48:28] mrxilio: ret war would struggle into top rogue comps on paper .... surprised they are playing thug in a tournament

[2:48:46] pwntrd: fistweaver cleaves off demo pets = immortal
[2:48:47] marvin1995xo: fistweaver stun portal troll
[2:48:48] Metaphors: it needs nerf
[2:48:48] kwlski01: its hard counter Sadge
[2:48:51] maenkins: intervene > sac > bop > sanc > lay
[2:48:58] aframpp: so true actually
[2:48:59] wackpoetic: Fistweaver comp loses when the Fistweaver can't connect, but you can't cc the Fistweaver with War/Ret covering for him
[2:49:01] ajdowers: Survival hunters need buffs fr it’s like the least commonly played spec in the game
[2:49:01] Hizuru1: @Metaphors then do more dmg
[2:49:04] Schwenkyytv: why play wizard when dh is in the game to play
[2:49:04] aframpp: all have kick too
[2:49:05] SirBeaverTeeth: i wonder if they played the first cup
[2:49:09] saren8: if you're stunned too there's that talent that makes them get damage reduc
[2:49:12] nikthevoker: just W harder!
[2:49:13] SirBeaverTeeth: maybe they will win in the finals over hoolibang OMEGAKEK
[2:49:15] ultra_content: but it struggle vs caster comb maybe?
[2:49:15] kustumtv: outlaw rogue will destroy that
[2:49:16] Blitzylive: easy to cc if out in the open though
[2:49:19] Metaphors: donnt @ me if ur bad
[2:49:20] fistweaveurnan: ret/war fistweaver has been good for a while now pretty troll for people to give u slack about pointing out the obvious
[2:49:21] gelatokush: best way to beat a fw is clone them
[2:49:29] zerx_gg: @Metaphors
[2:49:30] wackpoetic: @Metaphors
[2:49:37] Hizuru1: @Metaphors I just do it to bad like you
[2:49:37] sole2kx: Fw in 2s are so fun
[2:49:38] Ameratzu: frost dk / dev can destroy fw comp
[2:49:42] ajdowers: Has NA played her ?
[2:49:44] maenkins: then you have revival in stun
[2:49:56] nikthevoker: ya
[2:49:56] Lonedino88: like pala melee wings
[2:50:05] nikthevoker: melee wings was better atleast
[2:50:07] ryanblue98: dont @ c tier players guys
[2:50:09] Affixiate: 2min aspect of the crane or whatever for temporary fist was better
[2:50:15] Affixiate: this version is just toxic
[2:50:17] jugganautjoe: @venruki  dude the coolest thing happened today, i was rocking one of ur merch sweaters and a dude stopped me and asked me if that was a ven sweater while waiting in line to get food. Started talking bout wow. Was pretty sick
[2:50:18] thunderxmvp: Give back 1 min way of the crane and good 1 or 2 min melee wings
[2:50:18] maenkins: is that a remake?
[2:50:26] kwlski01: crazy that they won against hoolibang, explosive games
[2:50:32] hunchurio: how is it not a healthy spec? @venruki
[2:50:50] Hizuru1: cause he loses aint that deep
[2:50:58] TootinFresh: PowerUpL rukiTrig PowerUpR
[2:51:00] aframpp: I feel like fw isnt as easy as it sounds
[2:51:04] vmills: @jugganautjoe nice
[2:51:11] ATHLTE: caster mw with fw elements built into it sounds like so much more fun lol
[2:51:13] Fury73: I don't play either, isn't that the same concept as disc priest? damage to heal?
[2:51:19] nikthevoker: everything cleaves and breaks cc too
[2:51:26] nikthevoker: so if you happen to land cc
[2:51:32] Aphobiagaming: @Fury73 disc has to cast
[2:51:33] tangell0s: @Fury73 can't kick their fists
[2:51:34] thunderxmvp: @Fury73 Except disc does 80% or more of it's healing with actual healing
[2:51:36] mrxilio: i mean dont think many players play healer to do dmg... which dmg role has went up a ton for many healers
[2:51:38] moldybread00: disc can heal an entire game without doing dmg
[2:51:39] storm_chaser_ron: disc has non damage globals and also a castbar
[2:51:46] Fury73: gotcha
[2:51:48] Hizuru1: @Fury73 disco got gutted does nothing
[2:51:49] fistweaveurnan: @aframpp Its suspectible to swaps but ret/war negates that pretty well its tailor made for that comp
[2:51:59] Affixiate: fistweaver doesnt have to cast to heal just hit the nearest pet or anything and it heals like 4-5x atonement amount perma
[2:52:01] wackpoetic: Disc also doesn't perma top your team when doing damage. When a Fistweaver connects you basically can't kill anyone on their team
[2:52:07] TootinFresh: Think we'll see any new comps this week, or same as last week
[2:52:16] nikthevoker: sgt rat!
[2:52:26] Noscoc: Have you seen any demo locks today?
[2:52:27] TootinFresh: Waiting for double affliction to show up

[2:52:47] zerx_gg: https://7tv.app/emotes/61de32c05001b6b33b2e32c8 add emote please ven
[2:52:48] Hizuru1: watch Zen not having trink for swap
[2:52:49] lordelenath: just play double arcane mage + druid, the FW will heal 0 hps.
[2:52:52] lordelenath: :D
[2:52:52] OjBarnes: Big lack of double caster comps for a caster meta right
[2:52:54] gelatokush: fw only work with certain comps and its not the easiest spec to play the problem is caster mw is so low impact its kinda insane XD
[2:52:57] klong01: is AWC on again this week?

[3:12:35] flalia4: Warrior is good at peeling for homies not so much keeping themselves alive.
[3:12:39] lordelenath: certainly more utility than DH lol. But everyone has more utility than DH I feel. :D

[3:13:49] lordelenath: can you think of anyone else though? DH has insanely little utility I fear. It has insane dmg and survivability, but utility not so much
[3:13:59] tqsauce21: cage, dark, aoe stun, single target ranged stun, fear, reverse magic

[3:22:25] drfeltgood: @arn_333 Hoolibgins or something like that, it was just a team of three friends that entered the tourney for fun.
[3:22:26] sind233: @lordelenath LUL wdym, this isnt your job?
[3:22:50] lordelenath: @sind233 I can make it my job if you pay me 10k bucks.

[3:25:58] Kastun_: I miss big judge from bfa so much
[3:25:59] lordelenath: give plate back its armor. ret got way to squishy to melee.
[3:26:05] potkopvp: imo denounce, so they can be punished for dmg
[3:26:07] wackpoetic: Hpal seems like they have so many tools to win Shuffle games compared to Pres, but I don't want to have to re-gear another character
[3:26:17] potkopvp: wod paladin dmg was well designed, maybe too high with dmg wings
[3:26:34] What_ln_Tarnation: owen ret?
[3:26:35] pragma90: @lordelenath you mean nerf ret
[3:26:36] crawnpocktail: ultimate penitence a.k.a big peen
[3:26:37] kusoneko: YOU NEED TO CARRY THIS RET
[3:26:41] PSYC0N: make WoG worth pressing again

[3:27:41] zathonian94: i guess they just give 2200 to anyone now a days KEKW
[3:28:01] What_ln_Tarnation: @zathonian94 dps gain cr 10000X easier than healers
[3:28:16] What_ln_Tarnation: 2200 ret is like 1400 healer
[3:28:25] rianfresh: which makes it worse cause there is always 1 bad dps per lobby making it 3-3 for life on healers
[3:28:26] jmetz75: gaining CR is easier and the actual game is easier lol
[3:28:28] rianfresh: gaining no mmr no cr
[3:28:31] crawnpocktail: @What_ln_Tarnation so i'm like 4k rating on hpal then?
[3:28:32] crawnpocktail: nice
[3:28:41] What_ln_Tarnation: yes
[3:28:42] boundric: i think what would help healer cr is if a DPS goes 0 and 6 the healers should get cr.

[3:37:32] Hobblefoot: But he is handsome to be fair.

[3:37:40] heymomimonttv: kinda crazy that this chat just turns into hate on crusader chat or talk about crusader chat
[3:37:42] drfeltgood: Crusader's sad AF , dude missed R1 last season because he has alienated all the other people he could have Q'ed with. I've been in a few chats that his name is banned in chat lol.

[3:38:21] g2ody: Imagine if Crackling Jade Lightning had a 45 second CD, but it could remove 1 magical effect per tick while channeling. God, I want some Mistweaver utility so bad.
[3:38:23] drfeltgood: @lordelenath 100000%
[3:38:32] crawnpocktail: @dangen86 i also want to know this and whether you can greater fade UA
[3:38:33] seyvyur: they changed reverse magic to take UA dmg months ago
[3:38:35] Somanie: DAYDREAMING BY PARAMORE????
[3:38:38] Somanie: Dud3
[3:38:40] fistweaveurnan: @drfeltgood he technically didnt miss rank1 he got it in shuffle
[3:38:46] heymomimonttv: @lordelenath he's allowed to be cordial and professional about another player lol. he's clearly trying to avoid issues with the dude and chat keeps bringing the dude into it
[3:39:07] seyvyur: fade doesn't prevent UA dmg either anymore
[3:39:09] drfeltgood: @fistweaveurnan Stare
[3:39:13] seyvyur: just revival
[3:39:14] Somanie: stergeRollin this is how this song makes me feel
[3:39:27] lordelenath: @heymomimonttv hes allowed to do whatever he wants. and I'm allowed to have an opinion about that. this is the internet, we all have opinions about everything.
[3:39:32] Badasti: Crusaders persona is a skit, and even is if it isn't not everyone is that precious
[3:39:49] Badasti: if you dont like him dont watch him
[3:39:51] Hobblefoot: You all should prove yourselves the better people and focus on the positive well-meaning nature of people's character, however well hidden.  HIGH ROAD PEOPLE!

[3:40:34] boundric: crusader is a character, like asmongold. it what his viewers want.
[3:40:41] zachgamegodx: stop harassing ven guys
[3:40:48] zachgamegodx: he's a person with feelings
[3:40:51] heymomimonttv: @lordelenath yes but when you start telling ven to stop being polite about something, thats not having an opinion and thats you telling a streamer to succumb to your opinion of another player
[3:41:05] FateIRL: is asmon a character tho? hes like that even in his videos 15 years ago
[3:41:12] kusoneko: "dont pay attention to a single thing crusader says" ERMM MISTER STREAMER WHY ARE YOU MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM 🤓
[3:41:15] heymomimonttv: asmon is an enigma
[3:41:16] zerx_gg: Children, children. Relax
[3:41:25] Somanie: It gets worse the more it's talked about in chat, chopped and reversed 5x over, etc.
[3:42:00] heymomimonttv: i agree, ven's trying to avoid constantly talking about this dude and chat just never shuts up about him. then things get clipped, it creates more animosity for crusader towards ven, etc
[3:42:05] Somanie: You can watch both creators and just them be individual people

[3:44:47] fistweaveurnan: @lordelenath To watch the awc matches? drama queen
[3:44:53] heymomimonttv: @lordelenath that was an entire week ago cuz we had a watch party..... and he's been a constant topic of discussion in chat every day since, despite ven trying to diffuse it every time. enjoy your day tho man, i mean no disrespect towards you and hold no ill will
[3:45:00] malvarcla: @kikoplz yeah but they practically hand you trhe mats

[4:11:30] Releaserage: basicly same/old talents, "remaked" with fancy names imo
[4:11:33] xilyx2: the fact that jelly is benched 90% of the time over the last 10 years should spec to how well they're balancing hunter in some areas of the game. He should ask them that
[4:11:35] dpsEric: @VinnieK_ there are some abilities like frostfire bolt
[4:11:46] baxter5569: if this stuff replaces stuff we have and "upgrades" it it can be reall dope. just no more bloat
[4:11:49] xilyx2: he shouldnt ask them that ofc
[4:11:53] agren13: Some of these look nice and simple, the oracle stuff for priest looks like it's adding a bit too much complexity imo
[4:11:57] xilyx2: yep
[4:11:59] xilyx2: same thing
[4:12:04] guesswhofoo: theyre not all passives. black arrow is literally be readded

[4:12:27] wackpoetic: I feel like there should be ability pruning, or perhaps moving existing abilities into the new Hero talents
[4:12:34] slaughthemage: snowdrift is crazy if u r the go target imo
[4:12:42] xilyx2: i really play that much hunter but i would be upset about that if i di

[4:32:20] stilljane: im used to them
[4:32:21] Leredi: i thought that's like warlocks look like
[4:32:21] hamsti: OMEGALUL
[4:32:31] Riderqt: KEKW
[4:32:33] stilljane: ive kicked out SO many homeless people over the years
[4:32:33] kazz_ret: lmao
[4:32:34] twinbladeuk: KEKW
[4:32:35] stilljane: i lost count
[4:32:38] toogoo: as someone in red deer i feel you
[4:32:47] Spaceberry_McDuck: i used to live near a church that opened up to the homeless at night. had a few times where I'd come home from work and there'd be people passed out drunk/high just on the porch
[4:32:53] aarongarey1993: Are you allowed guns in Canada 🇨🇦?
[4:32:54] DoYouWannaHug: You should see Hawaii
[4:32:54] lordelenath: @stilljane kinda sad tbh. not your fault ofc, still.
[4:32:55] stilljane: over covid the homeless pop got worse in canada
[4:32:57] likeewlock: when NA matches
[4:32:58] DoYouWannaHug: We have so many homeless people in Hawaii
[4:32:59] Finejeeeeez: US is bad. SF is full of homeless people and needles
[4:33:01] YouAint_VeryBusy: its all the liberal strongholds
[4:33:02] sole2kx: Do you miss Canada?
[4:33:02] hamsti: I'm surprised Canada has homeless population? You'd think it'd be too cold?
[4:33:05] zachgamegodx: we have it in major cities, but not surburbs
[4:33:07] jfeliciano007: Problem is our two countries are weak
[4:33:13] zachgamegodx: not much
[4:33:13] potkopvp: hopefully trudeau gets it one day
[4:33:24] zachgamegodx: at least where im located
[4:33:27] lolheretic: thats very sad :( i live in australia i hope it never gets like that here
[4:33:34] junkyarddog4: I'm in Vancouver and there are tons of homeless on the streets
[4:33:39] GLYFEnation: Babooshka is my fave content.
[4:33:44] stilljane: there were still some outside in -40 temps in tents with heaters. i cant imagine how cold that must have been
[4:33:49] jawst3k: and free drugs for the homeless , we’re so nice
[4:33:51] kazz_ret: yea im from las vegas and its wild. theres literally a city of homeless people living under lasvegas in the flash flood tunnels. wild stuff
[4:33:53] FinkleTheMage: @venruki Someone called you Clearly Canadian and it made me think of that AMAZING sparkling water you guys got
[4:33:57] unZedd: what time does awc start?
[4:34:01] Hobblefoot: US homelessness is incredibly bad in some of the major cities as well.  It has made some places that used to be wonderful to visit completely destroyed.
[4:34:15] gaulois62: @potkopvp  Pierre Poilievre will fix it dont worry
[4:34:19] Zenishii: When are the NA games starting up
[4:34:29] lucasthebestx: when are they realising sod p2 in na?
[4:34:36] aarongarey1993: Uk has alot of drug problems and homeless people
[4:34:39] Extramediums: The cities also spend money to ship the unhoused to places like Vancouver and the surrounding area because the weather is more mild in the winter. Which has exacerbated all the issues with support structures here that help deal with it all because it's a national problem that's being forced upon individual cities to deal with with far less funding.
[4:34:44] zachgamegodx: which version of the expansion do you recommend people pre-order if they're going to do so? what did you pre-ordeR?
[4:34:44] Spaceberry_McDuck: @jawst3k where do we sign up for free drugs. still waiting for people to come and offer me the free weed that anti-drug programs warned me about in the 90s
[4:34:46] slaughthemage: Snowdrift is giga good if u r trained or just the go target
[4:34:47] zachgamegodx: the early access or nah?
[4:34:51] Badasti: its coz every monkey and his grandma plays melee now
[4:34:53] hamsti: Whats your favorite zone from any xpac to queue up in? Like afk while in queue i mean
[4:34:55] limit77: Excuse me sir! we only allow mages in this tournament
[4:35:02] slaughthemage: its like an auto peel
[4:35:11] Tyferious: Is orc played for AP buff or the stun reduction?
[4:35:14] Badasti: the world is nuts
[4:35:22] vmills: living in Hollywood I could walk out on my balcony and blindly throw a rock and there is a 50/50 chance I’d hit a homeless person.
[4:35:24] lordelenath: @Badasti sums it up quite well
[4:35:25] Badasti: there was a dude in the UK jerking off in front of someones window the other daty
[4:35:46] hamsti: Ya theres like zero homeless at all in my town
[4:35:50] potkopvp: @gaulois62 im from finland and not sure who that is, if he's the "conservative" guy, he seems real smart, same liberal politics are ruining this country too
[4:36:02] stilljane: lmao im just SO used to it i just tell them to leave me alone and move on with my day
[4:36:10] Boomer_Brian: you're in Calgary? I lived in Cochrane for 5 years and Calgary for 3
[4:36:10] tedstaTV: what are some frost flex talentss
[4:36:13] ragnof_: i mean cartman told us all what happens when you preorder
[4:36:17] Boomer_Brian: just moved out to bc 2 year ago
[4:36:28] aarongarey1993: There's a big heroin problem in the UK don't know about fentanyl though
[4:36:36] stilljane: fentanyl is soooo bad in US

[4:36:51] ion82: what's your opinion on mistweavers?
[4:37:15] Extramediums: So here in Van, we have daily issues of open hard drug use, overdoses, petty crime, assault, B&E, etc that further debilitate our emergency responses on top of the underfunding of our healthcare system, and end up putting even more money in the pocket of the police to 'enforce' (AKA discriminate and harass the marginalized) things that make no meaningful change in any of the areas that there is a struggle with
[4:37:20] gaulois62: @potkopvp yea exactly
[4:37:33] Ayvez_: yo ven u saw the new mage talents ?
[4:37:48] Creesu: yo ven nice mog i think u need a therapist

[4:39:16] Kittensrcute: i didn't watch yet, do a react to it
[4:39:30] pr1me1989: Why are you retired from AWC if I may ask?
[4:39:47] fantasiesgx: @ImJordanHi ublock
[4:40:05] zachgamegodx: he went all over the world
[4:40:10] zachgamegodx: awc was global
[4:40:12] slaughthemage: u played with Reckful aswell right?
[4:40:30] ezro_91: @venruki hey what frost mage build do you play in shuffle?
[4:40:32] djshadowrotterdamn: Yeah he played with Reckful a lot
[4:40:40] ImJordanHi: DotaTKO?
[4:40:40] ezro_91: can you share please?

[4:41:18] Tidal96: the jellybeans curse :(

[4:41:26] vmills: you are an amazing caster
[4:41:27] warbux2: more stressful than casting?
[4:41:28] cruelhabbitts: sounds like a good run you had
[4:41:31] jacob_the_mage: nobody wants to warm a bench
[4:41:35] Extramediums: @potkopvp I am not overly familiar with the politicking of Finland, most of the time that some one sites 'liberal policies' as a failing, it is due to a full plan not being implemented and only some elements. For instance in Canada our Federal Liberal party is maybe barely left of center on the political spectrum, and most of the solutions that are offered by the major parties are only half measures. While our Provincial Liberals are more right leaning than anything.
[4:41:35] lordelenath: you never get to play even though everyone knows youre insanely good
[4:41:40] Nidhronir: I remember discovering your stream for the first time during WoD, you had long hair back then
[4:41:44] Judgejobrown: the flip side is when gelu watched his team win awc and didnt do a single thing lol
[4:41:47] pr1me1989: in the other words, been there, done that and conquered it :) appreciate for the answer
[4:41:51] maxdoesmath: could make some pretty crazy teams from 4th players that would do well
[4:41:56] BigPatty123: the ad i just got was false, it said "tim hortons is always fresh" LIES
[4:41:57] fantasiesgx: @venruki excited for the meis to dominate AWC?

[4:42:05] unsccessful: yeah I always feel for that 4th man spot on the roster. Feel like its rare they get play time lol
[4:42:17] Extramediums: @BigPatty123 always 'almost-fresh' :D
[4:42:22] ezro_91: thx
[4:42:26] unsccessful: I cant remember when jellybeans got screentime
[4:42:30] jacob_the_mage: If you're pouring the champagne, it won't taste the same if 3 other people won
[4:42:34] Nuallan94: is thee kawhi team not playing anymore?
[4:42:47] fantasiesgx: @Nuallan94 no :(
[4:42:48] BigPatty123: @Extramediums theres the truth, my last 5 coffees had the cup leak at the seem down the side
[4:42:48] hemofeeliac: @warbux2 think about the amount of prep and theorycrafting that goes into playing in the AWC. most of that is eliminated. casters don't have to plan on how to beat all of these comps. they just have to call what they're seeing
[4:42:55] Jawinter: What is this 4 roasters.?
[4:42:57] Borngood: should be up to the players, put it to a vote, seems strange to keep rules to benefit 16 ppl
[4:42:57] wackpoetic: 3 player rosters is better for amateurism
[4:43:06] lordelenath: yeah, but at least these ppl could form a new team and get to play?
[4:43:09] storm_chaser_ron: i also dont think there are enough healers to go back now
[4:43:22] warbux2: @hemofeeliac true yeah
[4:43:24] likeewlock: more cash for 3 players
[4:43:27] QwQGolden: + no addons
[4:43:29] QwQGolden: pls
[4:43:37] maxdoesmath: spec ban or class ban?
[4:43:41] Extramediums: @Extramediums I actively avoid tims for so many reasons, but when my partner and I visit her parents on Vancouver Island, we always end up there (Her mom is a tims fiend), and even the 'freshly prepared' London fogs taste a little stale :D
[4:43:44] storm_chaser_ron: how would wow pick/ban go? are you talking for classes/specs or maps
[4:43:45] Riderqt: what kind of picks and bans? classes in particular? or plays/maps
[4:43:45] FinkleTheMage: How would bans work in your idea, could you only ban a class for one round?
[4:43:50] unsccessful: spec picks and bans would be so good
[4:43:51] deepTTV: im impressed the  move has kept wizk this long. alot of times they have been pressed to replace him. good thing they didnt cause they won now
[4:43:51] fantasiesgx: rogue bans every match
[4:43:53] hemofeeliac: not to mention the actual stress of performing absolute perfection in match after match
[4:43:56] lordelenath: my proposal for arena tournaments: no drinking, no addons, 3-player rosters.
[4:44:00] BCboy_: think of all the good teams if the best bench players teamed up
[4:44:01] SweatyDaniels: Hoolibanned
[4:44:05] potkopvp: @Extramediums yeah here it's a bit different, socialist party and the so-called right both push for mass-immigration, which has caused significant amount of problems in the metropolitan area, just look at sweden and the country is in a constant state of crisis and gangwar because of it
[4:44:09] dropbombsss: spec ban + 4 player rosters would be fun
[4:44:09] tedstaTV: it would be so good for spectators
[4:44:21] QwQGolden: i honestly think you remove the addons the game is far less scripted as its then based on player initiative
[4:44:32] SweatyDaniels: would that apply to only dps or healers too?
[4:44:39] SweatyDaniels: seems like theres not enough healing specs to ban
[4:44:42] hemofeeliac: are you talking about picks and bans of map or class/spec?
[4:44:58] j_rd95: community vote day before AWC - banning a single spec for each class Kappa
[4:44:59] SweatyDaniels: outlaw
[4:45:02] NerdEngineering: Ban outlaw
[4:45:04] NerdEngineering: lol
[4:45:04] 4dmk: that means everyone has to multi spec and multi classes. not everyone does that. and only recently alot of ppl started
[4:45:17] pr0x365: SOFT
[4:45:18] wackpoetic: You can say it, double Outlaw was a monstrosity
[4:45:19] j_rd95: Shadowlands Outlaw - double outlaw should never have been a thing
[4:45:31] ziloclol: *cough* rogue
[4:45:32] SweatyDaniels: ret paladin last season
[4:45:37] jawst3k: I think that would be great
[4:45:37] maenkins: venruki i play (this class) and it is not as good as you think it is, so we can't ban it
[4:45:40] NerdEngineering: you can say it @venruki we all know its outlaw
[4:45:52] deepTTV: i like being able to see real skill displayed not just OP shit
[4:45:53] KikLTheSoHot: ret pala after rework
[4:45:55] shefcurrywristaction: outlaw outlaw
[4:46:03] lordelenath: he got a gag order by the united rogues of world of warcraft association
[4:46:05] lordelenath: he cant say it
[4:46:06] averagegamergamin: wouldnt be a problem if class balance was a better
[4:46:14] ziloclol: SUB rogue s1 shadowlands LUL
[4:46:15] deepTTV: LUL
[4:46:19] lordelenath: :D
[4:46:26] lordelenath: managing your legal liability well
[4:46:27] Extramediums: @potkopvp I don't disagree with you on the topic of immigration, there's been a lot of talk about it here in canada, but a lot of it is baseless and is used to distract from the real issues of decades of neglecting infrastructure, allowing corporations to buy up all the homes (more than 50% of all new homes built in the last several years were bought en masse by corps) and erosion of the pillars of our society (health care, crown corporations that operate for the people, not for profit, etc).
[4:46:28] pr0x365: Pleading the 5th lol
[4:46:29] ThaCamBurglar: rogues perma banned for most teams haha
[4:46:31] justjoshingyo: it would be nice if the games didnt come down to who got a drink or not lol
[4:46:33] jawst3k: blink twice if you’re being held hostage
[4:46:35] NerdEngineering: Ven knows someone high up at Blizz is a rogue main and doesn't want to be put on the black list
[4:46:40] agren13: Not a big fan of pick and ban, that just makes playing as many spec/classes "the right way to play" then that just trickles down from the top to the rest of the game
[4:46:44] pr0x365: Ban Cyclone
[4:46:49] vmills: @kiklthesohot bro why does everyone say that they were  not broken … :p :D
[4:46:49] smitesucks: everyone and their dad is playing dh/outlaw cleaves at the piss pleb mmr and solo shuffle is nothing but double dh bm hunter
[4:46:53] lordelenath: honestly, is there any good reason not to remove drinking from arena? I cant think of any
[4:47:04] hulkdieselx: meld+drink really has no place in this game. shadowmeld should not drop combat. change my mind
[4:47:07] Iceflows84: If you read between the lines you already said which class is op right now. Haha.
[4:47:11] Extramediums: @potkopvp Unfortunately immigration is used to take all the pressure off the issues that are there regardless of immigration into countries.
[4:47:24] lordelenath: yes, maybe you would've to rebalance healer mana. but that would be way easier without having to consider drinking
[4:47:38] llomachenko: when is awc?

[4:47:43] Nuallan94: you can negate entire boss emchanics with meld so yeah
[4:47:45] Phreshbrew: meld is BIS for m+, like almost always
[4:47:50] BigPatty123: for the average player, they dont even know what to meld in m+ so it doesnt matter, they still die xD
[4:47:51] fantasiesgx: i just wish my paladin could be night elf
[4:47:51] hulkdieselx: i dont mind drinking in arena as it involves an extra layer of strategy to stop/assist drinks. but meld just breaks that
[4:48:07] mahz: Big fan of 30 secs to mars Ven. I dig this playlist. As well as the metal list
[4:48:08] lordelenath: @hulkdieselx its a freaking boring part of arena though.
[4:48:12] pr1me1989: do you think, the new expansion will bring hope and glory to wow and maybe bring it back on the track? since retail feels so empty. especially pvp
[4:48:20] slaughthemage: cute
[4:48:27] vmills: seems legit
[4:48:38] donotgivememana: disable drinking in stealth in arena maybe
[4:48:40] ziloclol: i played probably 30 Solo shuffles today, not a SINGLE game without a DH LUL
[4:48:47] mahz: Im a huge In Flames fan as well.  I've seen them 3-4 times I think

[4:50:07] WojoFog: its esfand
[4:50:08] Extramediums: @pr1me1989 I know that question is targeted at Ven, but since his chat exists, I figure I'll chime in: PVP will see a surge at the start, and once the broken meta is established will stagnate again. The good will of the PVP community is already quite low, so I feel that those issues of dead ladders and massive queues will persist and get worse
[4:50:12] hulkdieselx: @pr1me1989 low key this is 200iq, i got way better when i started analyzing my own gameplay

[4:51:09] potkopvp: @Extramediums yea I get what they tell us where they're coming from, truth is its mostly for cheap labour, its a very bad bandaid solution to a much bigger problem, since the cheap labour has an unemployment rate of 50%+ while they reap all the benefits, putting a lot of pressure on the government finances without actually resolving anything (in addition to all the other problems: violence, gangs, rapes so on)
[4:51:10] FinkleTheMage: Seems like a lobby you can own in!

[4:54:05] SokoLdOOb: what time AWC starts?
[4:54:19] yfflat: no mortal strike lobby, fun for healers perhaps
[4:54:40] Extramediums: @potkopvp Bringing in hundreds of thousands of people and not doing what is needed to support the higher population creates these problems, and the rich and powerful are the only ones benefiting. We have thousands of "Diploma mills" in Canada that promise education, a job, and a home but deliver on none, to simply profit off the students that genuinely want to immigrate and make better lives for themselves but arrive with none of that being provided. It's broken from the top all the way down

[5:13:24] Extramediums: @Extramediums Also, Crusader is playing with people that are generally on a higher level than him in terms of play and performance that he's less toxic to them because he knows that
[5:13:25] qirentv: @ImJordanHi wtf

[6:42:26] Badasti: @EmpStyle Palumor said something about Kangaroos being the only animal to have their cock behind their balls or something and Crusader said it's not the only animal Palumor is another one  and some other random crap and he had nothing to come back with
[6:42:30] Cvarks: mana gap is crazy tho

[8:03:53] mvqq: I wish the PvP devs would see outlaw rogue being OP from afar instead of after AWC already started, feels so obvious they were gonna be disgusting
[8:03:54] What_ln_Tarnation: <3
[8:03:54] sleightxyz: he's na now right

[8:05:52] dipicat: @ozzyxy my thoughts exactly
[8:05:56] What_ln_Tarnation: @Smexxin would be cool if devs could make a vid about the process of balancing so people can have a better understanding and maybe lead to less complaints
[8:05:57] wyldeshock: that addon shows the enemies gcds? wow
[8:05:58] sharpdressedman15: spin to win
[8:06:05] mvqq: Every game is mana, best classes for mana is heavy cc consistent damage, outlaw is the best for that. seems rly clear to me tbh @smexxin

[8:08:16] Sosatko: Nah dude dh is unplayable
[8:08:17] mvqq: yeah DHs are OP bcus they have the highest dmg in the game
[8:08:17] SamGold_: very good opponent

[8:08:21] EmpStyle: @IIyena HUHHH

[8:08:59] Basswater: mvq is a retard
[8:09:00] xilyx2: little help from a boomie exploit there tho
[8:09:00] ItsJhelo: rogue is a free win

[8:09:03] dipicat: @Basswater facts
[8:09:04] sno8831: @mvqq did you qualify the EU tourny?
[8:09:05] jasuvex: feral survivability is too good, needs some heavy nerfs....every team playing feral these days

[8:10:42] Complezity: quit complaining about dhs FROST DKS ARE OPPRESSED
[8:10:44] ozzyxy: @dankers7 I was, good lip reading
[8:10:44] IIyena: outlaw best melee
[8:10:50] Bowser20FTW: outlaws are just unkillable
[8:10:55] Itankarenas: frost dks are actually oppressed KEKW
[8:10:57] pvalue01: DH and outlaw are op, lets nerf enhance
[8:10:58] mvqq: I mean I fight an outlaw and don’t leave cc for half the game

[8:11:12] ferahgok: I just want ferals to run amok again
[8:11:13] ItsJhelo: Yes DH has massive dam but not unkillable, rogue has massive cc, unkillable, and does decent damage
[8:11:20] The_Twick: ORC WAR!?!?1
[8:11:22] The_Twick: wtf
[8:11:23] Smexxin: outlaw plays for mana the best and awc teams are crazy good at playing that long of games. dh is just as good at other things in the game tho imo
[8:11:24] pwntrd: DH is just as unkillable into most things
[8:11:25] The_Twick: gnome bis race
[8:11:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Outlaws tend to do less damage than windwalker and DH, going by the meters
[8:11:32] Robinhooez: DH is beyond broken
[8:11:34] TheEyeVII: not in stuns my guy
[8:11:36] IIyena: lmfao
[8:11:37] olairio: i just hate rogue sound effects.. like nails on a chalkboard in my ear all game
[8:11:38] sno8831: the question is ... is Saul gonna upset this weekend tourney again ... just like they did last time????
[8:11:41] dankers7: @ItsJhelo dh is one of the specs that survive the most in the game what
[8:11:43] Sosatko: No one will ever admit their spec is good lol its pretty weird
[8:11:44] Bowser20FTW: damage doesn’t equal broken
[8:11:44] The_Twick: @venruki you looking handsome as always today
[8:11:45] Lamatastisch: as a random 2.4k player I can say DH does more dmg BUT at least I can play the game against them. Outlaw just feels misserable
[8:11:46] para1yzar: imo most busted melee are dh/ww/rogue
[8:11:51] IIyena: didnt seem like it vs ww sub
[8:11:54] pvalue01: Smexxin with the s-tier takes
[8:11:55] What_ln_Tarnation: dont DHs have perma 20% magic DR
[8:11:58] Bowser20FTW: enhance has crazy damage…just squish
[8:12:05] Schwenkyytv: dhs are MUCH easier to pick up and play though
[8:12:06] IIyena: hard counter to dh tbh
[8:12:22] Bowser20FTW: I didn’t realize a class had to be difficult to be good.
[8:12:26] mvqq: even if outlaw wasn’t broken, they’re still unkillable with infinite movement speed and decent damage and insane CC - NOTHING SHOULD BE UNKILLABLE - Shit class design
[8:12:28] stealthwalker99: enh damage vs a good dh damage isn't even close
[8:12:31] saren8: HE HAS FROSTMOURNE? o:
[8:12:33] dipicat: nerf dh dmg and nerf rogue cc/defensives
[8:12:33] Grimm303: LUL

[8:12:54] shamebadge: venruki you need to uncap your stream bitrate. increase your quality :P
[8:12:55] Lamatastisch: Buff DK deffensive Madge
[8:12:59] gdodmebxu: @dipicat ?????
[8:13:00] friendshrimp: why does no one channel their legendary in pvp?
[8:13:00] Endoraesh: what makes dh tanky in stun?
[8:13:00] fistweaveurnan: make boomy cast to do damage again
[8:13:00] dankers7: buff feral for the love of god I am losing my mind
[8:13:03] dipicat: @mayfire15 facts
[8:13:05] airey: its so sad to see sam playing boomy instead of mage with a rogue what has the game come to
[8:13:10] SweetBabyLilo: buff treants
[8:13:11] Ultratoasted: Yeah but it lost! Madge
[8:13:13] ferahgok: @dankers7 yes please
[8:13:13] xilyx2: rogue makes everything viable
[8:13:15] dipicat: nobody cars about frost mage
[8:13:16] waggz: buff feral
[8:13:18] Bowser20FTW: Sam is probably the S tier boomy though
[8:13:20] mayfire15: buff frost mage and boomy then lol
[8:13:20] unc0de: @venruki hes arguably the best boomie though - average boomies aint playing like him
[8:13:23] Arcanocrystal: buff outlaw
[8:13:24] Reizzy42: they all play with outlaw rogue lol
[8:13:27] Bowser20FTW: I don’t know a lot who measure up
[8:13:30] Ultramagnus85: and the boomy team beat the winning team the first time around
[8:13:30] saren8: frostmage outlaw :^)
[8:13:31] sno8831: @mvqq maybe ...what you can part up as outlaw is more op than what dk can
[8:13:33] HazardLaw94: i saw what a boomy could do to shut down a rogues damage
[8:13:34] IIyena: arcane op
[8:13:35] gdodmebxu: @unc0de game can't be balanced around avg players
[8:13:36] pwntrd: ye me too frost mage main since cata
[8:13:37] LokixSun: frost mage assa rogue, do it
[8:13:41] yesterday_potato: Ive never played DH before and hit 2lk in 7 lobbys felt good
[8:13:42] sharpdressedman15: what about ele sham
[8:13:42] The_Twick: Frost unironically needs a burst dmg buff....
[8:13:43] Jackherrerr: why arent you in the tourney ven?!?!
[8:13:52] sno8831: what a dh can *
[8:13:55] dankers7: "boomy one good comp" thats complete cap lmao
[8:13:56] danielbanks: What mage spec would you play with evoker and h Pala @venruki
[8:13:59] Bowser20FTW: @yesterday_potato things that never happened
[8:14:11] Mowgles25: Laros is insane at warrior jeez
[8:14:21] Reizzy42: @Jackherrerr you make more money being a commentator prob and tourney prep is harsh
[8:14:24] mvqq: also if DH didn’t have insane damage they’d be poop; their fear got neefed to 3 seconds, and darkness to 50% so their utility is pretty bad.
[8:14:27] rizdane: the melee cleave is back how fun
[8:14:33] unc0de: @gdodmebxu but im saying thats why people will say buff this buff that...because people can play classes to full potential..
[8:14:33] waggz: give feral shift dodge back plz
[8:14:34] TheEyeVII: @Jackherrerr cuz he's washed for a decade
[8:14:39] Bowser20FTW: DH utility is super bad lol
[8:14:47] para1yzar: Agreed
[8:14:50] Itankarenas: yeah
[8:14:59] Bowser20FTW: remember when rogues had 3 s tier specs ?
[8:14:59] Mowgles25: agreed
[8:15:01] pwntrd: DH has the most instant cc in the game lol
[8:15:02] pvalue01: enhance modCheck we've had 1 comp for 10 years Sadge
[8:15:09] nightmxz: disagree, I think everything should be able to play at least 3 :) the game is the most fun when there's variety on the ladder
[8:15:11] unc0de: remember when double outlaw was a comp
[8:15:15] boomkin_exploit: agreed. i think if that was true of every class the game would feel different
[8:15:17] Reizzy42: f tier sounds really good
[8:15:19] What_ln_Tarnation: @pwntrd not really, thats rogues
[8:15:20] danielbanks: I have no idea how dh can complain lol.
[8:15:21] tarth_100: cacoon is brutal

[8:16:29] sno8831: this team is a winning mindset! they might not make it this tournament but i can see them participating and growing more in the future!
[8:16:30] Bowser20FTW: good teammates. I like listening to the move, liquid and f tier
[8:16:36] Jackherrerr: @TheEyeVII hes not washed.. the game is fucking ridiculous these days
[8:16:42] Bowser20FTW: Great comms
