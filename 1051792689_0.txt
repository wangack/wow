[1:31:05] sl1nky1981: @Shrenko I can't agree that it's better. It's just different. I will say that the character progression, while slower, feels much better in TBC. You actually feel like you're getting stronger little by little. In my opinion, it will lose its shine just like SL did after a little while. Of course, this is just my opinion. The community is starved for content and this is new content.

[3:46:56] borathius: His loyalty is his view count
[3:46:57] Jeddek_: It's not more SUBS
[3:47:00] BeardedDADPlaysAMage: that boy beater though
[3:47:00] MMOrpgPrincess: It is free trial though
[3:47:04] KinggKebab: Its very much a lie
[3:47:04] railroad10989: @Towelliee  i seen the same thing it doenst count classic players into it
[3:47:08] cosmothug: are you switching to final fantasy now that its bigger
[3:47:16] K_A_N_J_I: Ff14 was fun for a bit until I was stuck for days doing quest to get to the next expansion. Instant turn off to the game.
[3:47:19] Jeddek_: But its more active players
[3:47:20] MMOrpgPrincess: Ragnarok Online had more world-wide players than Wow if you count all countries.
[3:47:23] Wildside1177: There is data that shows there are more FF14 players if you include the trial accounts.
[3:47:28] Morpserie: i enjoy WoW way more than i'll ever enjoy FF14
[3:47:39] Nokterian: Hey @Towelliee
[3:47:44] xRags4: WoW is most likely higher. The numbers are irrelevant though. Both are fun games to me PrideShrug
[3:47:49] MrGattz: ffxiv has a free trial that you can play for hundreds of hours. and wow between both SL and Classic still has more active players than ffxiv according to the article itself.
[3:47:51] TheUnknowing: Any one could write an article and say whatever they want, doesnt make it tue
[3:47:54] TheUnknowing: true*
[3:47:58] theDirtyon3: @Wildside1177 Why would you count trials?
[3:47:58] akia03: ff14 housing proffesions and glamours are fun rest meh
[3:48:08] Dapperedodo3: didnt the article use a source that also says wildstar has active players
[3:48:09] borathius: Ff14 will never be more active when Wow comes out with new content.  Fluctuation is to be expected especially when there is a content drought
[3:48:11] Jeddek_: To enjoy FFXIV, you need to enjoy Story and casual play
[3:48:14] Zipacnae: towJesus
[3:48:15] UNSUNG_HER0: FFIV claims over 22 million players...hrm
[3:48:39] Nokterian: uh oh
[3:48:41] Nokterian: LUL
[3:48:49] Nokterian: flayer attack!
[3:48:51] Zebingt0n: probably 22mil created accounts
[3:48:52] Nimz83: FF14 is fun in its own right. I personally won't tank in WoW, but since Warrior plays like DPS in FF14 I love it
[3:48:53] Oldduketree007: ffxiv is fun do
[3:48:53] abbosss: those ff players are bloodthirsty its crazy
[3:48:56] 24sevn: wow has a free trial as well :)
[3:49:01] Jeddek_: WoW boasts 115 million accounts, of those, 3.5mil active
[3:49:11] Smoknjoe24: 22 Mil players 21 million free trials
[3:49:19] mitchumtx: they said ACTIVE players not accounts
[3:49:24] TheUnknowing: I love FF14 but ill never be so delusional to think it will overtake WoW
[3:49:27] 24sevn: sub numbers are down with the delay of 9.1 thats just a fact :)
[3:49:28] UNSUNG_HER0: i might actually try the free trial right now lol...never even saw a video of gameplay for it yet haha
[3:49:33] Morpserie: population should only count for who's paying the sub fee imo
[3:49:40] theDirtyon3: ^
[3:50:01] mitchumtx: Towelliee you think you a little biased? I mean i love WOW but FF14 might be the true competitor with WOW
[3:50:02] Vecin: why does anyone care?   just play the game you like
[3:50:04] dualz6045: wow always going to be #1, ff14 is doing great for itself, but not going to surpass wow anytime soon, if ever
[3:50:23] rhodeos_: at first it was a 7 day trial
[3:50:24] Nokterian: level 60 and heavensward in FF14 trial
[3:50:29] chrslp: WoW Free trial doesnt give a good feel for the game
[3:50:30] Zakali: Free trial should be everything, cep tthe last expansion
[3:50:32] GrizlyInsertion: @Towelliee I just hit renown 39 in retail. I am so happy. One more to go.
[3:50:46] blingblang19: what up towellie
[3:50:57] akia03: wow free trail is nice for rpers thats about it
[3:51:00] Nimz83: Now that vinyl they are releasing for each expansion is pretty awesome
[3:51:02] mitchumtx: i think FF14 with surpass WOW soon! just alot of players going from WOW to FF14
[3:51:07] GrizlyInsertion: lol, well, this is my main and I was away from wow for a few years.
[3:51:11] brewgamingtv: I played FF14 back when i stopped in legion. The long level grind and the amount of running around you had to do was a turn off for me.
[3:51:19] Nokterian: dont forget 40 more renown is coming in 9.1 LUL
[3:51:28] NoWaayMan: the free trial for wow is so shitty man. "lets give you a free trial of your character at level one with zero abilities" so dumb
[3:51:36] mitchumtx: I know my whole guild on Illidan went to FF14 thats about 120 players
[3:51:45] GrizlyInsertion: @Nokterian I know, thats why I have been pushing hard to hit renown cap.
[3:51:47] Jeddek_: I dont think FFXIV will overtake WoW, but if there's competition, maybe WoW will do something
[3:51:49] Morpserie: FF14 KEKW
[3:51:50] Jeddek_: COPIUM
[3:51:55] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah, FF combat is SO slow. They give you oGCD abilities way too late
[3:52:03] Ponas91: players wont come back until next expac
[3:52:05] Archiee: but what is 9.1 really doing to fix the problems SL has had since day 1? Not a whole lot in my opinion
[3:52:20] Nokterian: Problem is content drought in WoW
[3:52:23] K_A_N_J_I: @mitchum69 ff14 is only gaining players due to an extra long drought. People always go to other mmos when wow is on a drought. It’s hard to believe ff14 is going to retain those players when wow content comes out
[3:52:23] layercake2004: Get back to me when FF37 comes out
[3:52:26] Nokterian: to many systems upon systems
[3:52:29] Jeddek_: Theres content drought in FFXIV atm too
[3:52:32] AerinRavage: Why you gotta do FF dirty like that? Make it fair and compare FF 11's pop Kappa
[3:52:40] Adam12err: Ashes of creation maybe haha
[3:52:41] Mazzial: @K_A_N_J_I true
[3:52:45] Jeddek_: What, all 500 of them @AerinRavage ?
[3:53:02] AerinRavage: @jedd
[3:53:04] joe_g_433: All this FF14 talk and comparing the games will allllll go away when 9.1 drops.
[3:53:09] xXSiebzehnXx: @jeddek_ MAH NUMBAS
[3:53:13] mitchumtx: I believe shit will continue be broken in WOW comes 9.1...Good thing about FFXIV is that they actually listen to their players a fix with the next patch...not at the end of the xpac like blizzard
[3:53:36] Norinski: lmao ff does not fix things next patch

[3:54:01] Jeddek_: I mean if we counted Private Servers as well @aerin then there's probably a decent, 20k
[3:54:04] Norinski: ive played the game for years idc what forums say
[3:54:11] Jeddek_: @AerinRavage ^
[3:54:16] Norinski: ff is great but it has its flaws too
[3:54:20] KrimsonElite: I miss the Legion grind
[3:54:21] cineris_3: just need more content, SL is good
[3:54:24] akia03: solo content lacking
[3:54:25] xXSiebzehnXx: @mitchum69 the last couple of expansions it seems like they give us the beginning systems bare bones and expect us to wait to implement the meat to the bones of the systems
[3:54:26] Norinski: like the server tick anyone?
[3:54:32] Nokterian: Not game breaking it is more player power or borrowed powers..
[3:54:40] Nokterian: conduits are there and yet thats it

[3:54:50] Jeddek_: I personally MISS Legion legendaries system compared to what we currently have
[3:55:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: the maw fuegoKek
[3:55:05] 24sevn: no reason to login in shadowlands
[3:55:13] xXSiebzehnXx: @jeddek_ i didn’t play Legion, but I miss that LUL
[3:55:15] xxKrayzie: bullshit^^
[3:55:21] Nokterian: BfA was good when essences came in
[3:55:27] ohbunga: For me it's just how stats work in current sl vs tbc, I think gear was  much more interesting in the past
[3:55:31] xXSiebzehnXx: BFABESTEXPAC?
[3:55:47] mitchumtx: At the end of the day WOW will ALWAYS be my go to. just right now just not fun
[3:55:55] KrimsonElite: I think Legion was my favorite grind
[3:55:59] Nokterian: WQ's right now are no fun
[3:56:06] Jeddek_: I liked legion AP grind more than the one for BFA
[3:56:06] KrimsonElite: Artifact weapons were so good
[3:56:09] Nokterian: looong WQ's
[3:56:09] JustAwaay: but it also kept others away
[3:56:10] brewgamingtv: What you put into a game is what you get out of it. If you put little to no effort into a game your not going to get shit out of it.
[3:56:11] fullyhollow: there's a better solution than infinite progression systems
[3:56:40] Norinski: personally i think both games are happy bring the top two mmorpgs
[3:57:09] mitchumtx: wow and FF14 are definitely the top 2 MMORPGs in the world atm
[3:57:12] Norinski: i feel like thw two games are meant for two different types of player5s
[3:57:36] mitchumtx: LUL
[3:57:39] Jeddek_: Why WoW and WoW?
[3:57:47] mitchumtx: retail and classic @Jeddek_

[4:02:13] Jeddek_: I guess it depends on your definition of what content is
[4:02:15] stallowned: garrisons KEKW
[4:02:16] FortuneDd: FF just feels like a slog of story and other tiny things you can do on the side that barricade the content I actually wanna play
[4:02:19] smokey_jay99: you wouldnt consider guild halls in wow content if they came out with it?
[4:02:23] mitchumtx: Garrisons KEKW
[4:02:37] Jeddek_: If something is "I want to log in for this", then it's content for me
[4:02:38] mitchumtx: i spent my entire time that xpac in my garrison or Ashran

[4:04:38] mitchumtx: what's the perks of a home? kinda like ESO?

[4:05:12] mitchumtx: Towelliee, what do you think the outcome of New World will be?
[4:05:37] Jeddek_: 1-2 months, depending on the MTX
[4:05:59] fizzleblast127: fizzleblast127 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[4:06:01] Norinski: @diathi123 ive tried as recently as 8.1 but im on gilgamesh so i think thats why itys impossible for me (seemingly)
[4:06:03] Jeddek_: Or driven by How many Streamers are in one Faction, skewing it towards that faction
[4:06:07] Nokterian: and you as a solo player are screwed in those mmo's
[4:06:18] Emilos711: it is actually locked
[4:06:32] TheUnknowing: new world will have its player base but i dont think its going to be huge, that being said I do plan on playing it myself atleast for a few months
[4:06:33] mitchumtx: So pretty much you have to know which faction is taken over on a server and go with that? or else your fucked?
[4:06:37] Jeddek_: Really @Norinski ? Im on Gilgamesh and we got a guild house pretty easily
[4:06:48] Nokterian: It's amazon look at there track record of games LUL
[4:06:58] Norinski: @Jeddek_ yeah i guess just bad luck
[4:07:07] Nokterian: they shut down more studios and canceled more games than they brought out
[4:07:23] akia03: @Jeddek_ guildhouses have different rules tho compared to personal houses
[4:07:34] mitchumtx: I feel like New World will be a turnaround for Amazon tbh
[4:07:42] TheUnknowing: the crafting in new world is pretty good
[4:07:54] unexistant: what's the farm here?
[4:08:05] mitchumtx: Being part of the Alpha New World since it came out.....it's not bad at all
[4:08:06] Jeddek_: But yea @mitchum69 the housing system you can have like training dummies, merchants, stables, etc
[4:08:27] ThaOriginalGamester: i got into the alpha and never launched it LUL
[4:08:53] stallowned: ruin owned that swtor server
[4:08:56] mitchumtx: @ThaOriginalGamester yea i am afraid to say i have about 234 hours played on the Alpha
[4:09:02] Norinski: i got into the alpha too and its fun but i find myself not caring about doing anything
[4:09:10] Wildside1177: I had to open about 15 to get it
[4:09:21] Jeddek_: It'll be a game that needs friends to play
[4:09:23] MikedUpGaming: I'm playing the Alpha currently as I watch

[6:41:00] Charlemagne_66: i play a warrior tank but looking at someone play a paladin tank it looks so chill in dungeons
[6:41:20] Charlemagne_66: warrior it is so stressful on packs with 4 or more
[6:41:32] MackPlays: Wrath classic will be lots of Blood tanks
[6:42:02] Charlemagne_66: yeah for sure
[6:42:14] Charlemagne_66: i honestly think the problem is in dungeons sometimes i am too tanky even some heroics
[6:42:15] force_FMD: wrath will be full of blood dps also

[6:42:25] Zebingt0n: frost tanks woo
[6:42:37] Venkxx: I will definitely play a frost tank
[6:42:45] ChalupaBatman25: prot paladins is a little frustrating being a threat pinata, not much snap threat we have
[6:42:45] ByronOrpheus: blood dk dps was the first spec I raided with
[6:42:46] MackPlays: I liked Unholy myself, dps
[6:43:10] MerffTV: All three tanks are going to be fine. We're going to see that old meta blown to pieces becauase players are *much* better now.
[6:43:19] ChalupaBatman25: using it while mobs are on you isn't ideal
[6:43:28] Charlemagne_66: i think that paladins have higher snap threat than warriors with 0 rage going into a pull
[6:43:32] flying_ikarus: You could pretty much dps and Tank in Every du spec in wrath
[6:43:47] Alienfromger: every new classic will get less and less popular. perhaps they wont do wotlk classic
[6:43:49] flying_ikarus: Dk*
[6:43:59] MerffTV: I'm playing a warrior and am having a blast countering the AOE argument. Yes, you work a bit more, but you can do it. Paladins will be fine in raids as well. We're just better now.
[6:44:03] ChalupaBatman25: using avengers shield while getting smacked by 6mobs is not ideal since you can't dodge parry or block.
[6:44:06] ChalupaBatman25: yeah warriors have higher snap threat
[6:44:20] Charlemagne_66: warriors can aoe tank it just might give you carpal tunnel
[6:44:45] Thyfatman89: what about druid tanks tho ?
[6:45:29] ChalupaBatman25: i just meant with impatient dps who won't let you get smacked a bit first

[6:45:47] D1Chile: @Towelliee  and dont u also have like a  aoe taunt on low cds lol
[6:46:05] Charlemagne_66: only thing i could see the guy talking about is say a pack just comes in without getting shield off then the snap threat could be bad

[6:46:45] Broomba: cant tell what the argument or lack of one was
[6:46:46] MerffTV: I would like to see the target cap on Thunderclap removed, and the CD on challenging shout lowered. But the #nochanges crowd would be apopleptic
[6:47:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: Rip earth
[6:48:27] D1Chile: @Towelliee  that what i said
[6:48:44] MerffTV: 10 mins yea, it's stupid
[6:49:06] Hundicasm: I'm not used to having to stop to drink after every mob, I feel like I'm slowing down my group
[6:49:40] neverbornlucky: Warrior sux it the Paladins are the master now get in line and get whipped or get sent to the shadowlands
[6:49:57] secretzor: What realm is he playing on btw? RPPVP?
[6:49:58] mrmanno14: @towelliee hot tub stream when?
[6:50:13] Charlemagne_66: if tclap was still limited to 4 targets but scaled with AP it would be alot easier
[6:50:24] D1Chile: @Towelliee warrior aoe threat is ok for what it is  suppose to be  just  high skill celling for warrior than it is for other classes
[6:50:28] jerm123456: is this heroic??
[6:50:55] MerffTV: One thing Classic has taught me is that the original class devs had absolutely no idea how to balance anything, and even within each class they were just throwing abilites against the wal and calling it art.
[6:51:31] D1Chile: @Towelliee  the issue with warrior  is that if u dont tank ur not very likely to get in groups tho
[6:51:34] Charlemagne_66: up until 66 i just tanked as fury prot dual wield for most dungeons
[6:51:40] MerffTV: I would have liked to see some balancing before BC classic release, or at least a few weeks into things
[6:51:47] neverbornlucky: wonder what blizzard stance is on shadow run pc's . Would they ban someone for running wow from another computer to a off site if still using keyboard and razer type controllers
[6:51:51] D3m0nHunt3r666: I will
[6:51:59] D3m0nHunt3r666: after I finish this shaman lol
[6:52:06] secretzor: @neverbornlucky wait really?
[6:52:13] ChalupaBatman25: yeah by no means was i trying to say omg poor us prot paladins. i'm just saying when i'm taunting mobs that get yanked off me by seed of corruption spam. sometimes just taunt and hope they hit me sucks i wish avengers shield was instant so i can taunt then just smack them
[6:52:18] ChalupaBatman25: that's all i meant
[6:52:18] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:52:36] thetrumenshow: i believe you can also use a boomkin to tank instead of a mage now too.
[6:52:40] stallowned: i can hunter tank the shaman for gruuls
[6:52:51] Dalsonson: You also need a Boomy Tank for Gruuls yea?
[6:53:02] neverbornlucky: a lot of people in vr are using s shadow type computers companies that provide a computer set up to play vr without a vr computer at home wondering if blizzard would be against that for wow on the go

[6:58:46] valyrianz: i request salv as an spriest threatlord
[6:58:52] thetrumenshow: also prot pally's normal taunt does multiple mobs vs single target taunt
[6:58:56] Anderus00: @jerm123456 yes heroic

[6:59:25] sleepy_anko: Its all muscle memory by now :P
[6:59:51] MrSnekyDino: Do you have a shield spike?
[7:00:05] thetrumenshow: sanc is good when tanking a lot of weak mobs, kinds is better vs hard hitting mobs like in heroics
[7:00:16] BloodWakkaGaming: could you say that bok is more single and sanctum is more aoe ?
[7:00:45] TheOGMed: cant do both
[7:00:49] MrSnekyDino: Yeah, spike or chant not both
[7:01:15] BloodWakkaGaming: the reflect dmg helps with aggro if you tank packs i feel :D
[7:01:31] BloodWakkaGaming: but i see why ppl like bok aswell
[7:01:33] thetrumenshow: reducing 50 dmg is a lot when they hit for 200 dmg, but not so much when they hit for 600-1k
[7:02:05] ChalupaBatman25: i've only used sanc when i've had a group that lets me pull 3-4 packs at once and holy shield gets eaten up like in 1 second
