[5:13:07] carefacel_l: goblin glider kit
[5:13:19] keno_07: @tonathan99 it’s great but gets tiring and especially with arms doing more damage now a little redundant
[5:13:43] Tilly4Rilly1337: MercyWing1 riPepperonis MercyWing2 [I agree: Totally; Completely] TheIlluminati
[5:13:54] Shaggy19931: @Swifty im a disc priest

[5:14:26] fckmlf23: Is wow worth playing now? If I want to return and have some fun, not feeling like it is a 2nd job
[5:14:38] PoorManPower: Is that a healer icon above enemy healers and if so what addon is it
[5:14:38] hks1057: Hey btw what's that addon that reads out the cds?
[5:14:58] Duffmannz: @fckmlf23 ITS KIND LONG TO GET GEAR FIRST TIME BACK
[5:15:07] IndieWolfTV: @fckmlf23  definitely playable just as a casual game now
[5:15:38] keno_07: @fckmlf23 it’s alright, just spend a lot time in ZM
[5:15:50] bigdawgmoses: Where’s peanut
[5:15:52] funnyc4t: Pve is super easy to get gear now, alot of catch up systems.
[5:16:13] Sphinx2k: need more healers
[5:16:25] deltabreeze_2: What about gearing in PvP? If no main does it take a while?
[5:16:27] IndieWolfTV: ZM drops so much gear now
[5:16:27] keno_07: M+ is really good for gearing
[5:16:31] funnyc4t: You can buy mythic plus gear now, from the vendor at the fly patch
[5:16:38] hks1057: Yup, I had 4set and both 291s within 2 weeks of hitting 60
[5:16:51] funnyc4t: Yes, for valor :D
[5:16:57] hks1057: But then ofc u have to rank up your pvp gear via rating
[5:17:03] keno_07: Got a 278 2 hander from NW on my warrior in vault today
[5:17:09] ingelaa: but that is only 236 ilvl
[5:17:16] koctopus: You cannot buy 278 gear though, nor can you upgrade the m+ gear past 272
[5:17:20] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:17:23] funnyc4t: You get 200 valor, if you get score
[5:17:36] Duffmannz: @Headcrab_2 PVP GEAR KIND EZ TO GET IF YOU LEVEL USEING bgS (BUT VERY HARD TO GET MAX PVP GEAR LATER :) ITS RANK CAPED
[5:18:03] koctopus: Cannot upgrade past 272 on the m+ gear, 278 only comes from mythic raids or the m+ vault on weekly reset
[5:18:11] funnyc4t: The mythic plus gear you buy is 1/12 upgraded. But it's nice for gearing alts.
[5:18:14] keno_07: Not worth upgrading 2 hander weapons from 236 tho … like 12k Valor
[5:18:40] Knaxxis: yeah thats what he means
[5:18:43] funnyc4t: Nono, if one person in the group, gets raider io score, you get bonus valor +65, so 200 total
[5:18:50] Eberhardt3: if someone in the group gain Mythic raiding u get more valor
[5:19:01] poochwow: You want a pocket healer swifty? lol
[5:19:01] screwdrivera: i am the holy priest :)
[5:19:08] koctopus: You get bonus valor if you time your m+ and anyone in the group increases their m+ rating(200 total) if you time the key.
[5:19:14] Metalcalfe: can't wait for dragonflight where all pvp gear is the same
[5:19:16] Sphinx2k: need healers peanut!
[5:19:18] screwdrivera: jk
[5:19:20] keno_07: @funnyc4t which score are you referring to? As in IO?
[5:19:27] KodiakJedi: I finally for my first ever max level weapon in Shadowlands on any character. Got a 278 Warglaive on my DH. Has non optimal stats but it's a 278
[5:19:35] Knaxxis: ahhh so if someone in the groups breaks some sort of threshhold the rest of the groups ggets an additional 65 Valor?
[5:19:38] Knaxxis: is that correct chat
[5:19:53] Tilly4Rilly1337: I am happy when you play your Warrior.
[5:20:00] zaddyz34: What are those weapons buffs showing up ?
[5:20:06] funnyc4t: @keno_07 Yes, the mythic plus raiting, not sure what blizzards point system is called tbh. But the same as raider io.
[5:20:18] KodiakJedi: That's for PvE...not PvP...you can get higher for PvP

[8:13:09] JakeandBake518: Swifty don't you love doing the ZM Campaign on every alt to get the legendary
[8:13:43] JakesterSolo: ^ yea pve aint my thing
[8:13:51] JakeandBake518: You dont use legendaries for your pvp gear?
[8:13:56] KodiakJedi: You can pretty much skip the ZM campaign
[8:14:21] KodiakJedi: you just need to go to ZM and open the rare chests and get 200 from each and craft your 291
[8:14:35] KodiakJedi: You can get 2000 in like 10 min
[8:14:36] JakesterSolo: swifty was saying earlier that its probably too late to get into this xpac so im probs just gonna wait for dragonflight or wotlk classic to resub
[8:14:49] MrAndMrsReVamp: I agree blaster
[8:14:53] MrAndMrsReVamp: Keeps getting better
[8:15:07] JakeandBake518: but theres two legendaries. two 291's
[8:15:17] KodiakJedi: You can easily get enough to craft one and then with just a little of work you can get the 2nd
[8:15:19] Tilly4Rilly1337: u r cool
[8:15:24] JakesterSolo: that would be agreed
[8:15:28] KodiakJedi: or just craft a 262 while you wait
[8:15:43] JakeandBake518: @KodiakJedi by little work u mean the campaign?
[8:15:44] willywonkerzz: Hey John, did u guys buy your new house yet?
[8:15:52] KodiakJedi: That's what I did...crafted a 291 unity and then a 262 on my alts until I had enough to upgrade the 2nd to 291
[8:15:55] aherb25: do you have the battered hilt?
[8:16:28] KodiakJedi: @JakeandBake518 I have a few alts with 291 now without the campaign...others I did the campaign on
[8:17:09] KodiakJedi: It depends how fast you want the double 291.

[8:17:52] KodiakJedi: I do wish they had another way to get the cosmic flux or at least let you farm it on the main and send it to the alt
[8:18:00] JakesterSolo: are dh's still good in retail thou? cos i had an absolute blast playing my dh in legion
[8:18:07] KodiakJedi: My main has like 50k Cosmic Flux
[8:18:20] KodiakJedi: I main a DH now...swapped in 9.2

[8:23:39] JakesterSolo: @KodiakJedi  agreed brother, i was also playing ret for years before trying DH then it was so hard to go back to ret that I just stayed DH until i stopped during BFA
[8:24:17] Galdrena: a wow streamer
[8:24:42] KodiakJedi: @JakesterSolo I was ready to quit WoW. I was playing 3 classes and was burnt out. Then swapped to DH for this patch 9.2 and it made me enjoy the game again.
[8:25:32] JakesterSolo: ^exactly how I felt too man, DH was the best addition to the game since wrath imo, I hope they will still be good in dragonflight when i return to retail
[8:25:33] KodiakJedi: I focused on just 1 class...then towards the end started to dabble in alts. That helped too just focusing on one at the start of the patch.

[8:41:18] devvdawggg: i feel like they gota rework racials or not enable them in pvp
[8:41:22] JakesterSolo: @TyGuyi gw2 pvp is really fun but not as active as wow and so many people dont focus objectives in it

[8:42:42] TyGuyHunter: i enjoy it, i just play MMOs tho
[8:42:56] TyGuyHunter: the structure and WvW is very good
[8:43:03] JakesterSolo: comparing it to wow pvp is hard thou
[8:43:15] JakesterSolo: I found WvW to be a clusterfk tbh
[8:43:22] Strokelock: @JakesterSolo cool. Think I still have 2 aacounts there lol
[8:43:24] TyGuyHunter: i just feel like its a nice break from wow sometimes because it's a few less buttons hahahaha
[8:43:34] JakesterSolo: but it can be fun if you know what your doing and have some friends with you
[8:43:39] Strokelock: true
