[3:12:08] gregtehcow: meta ruined the game more than anything
[3:12:08] levit8TNG: same dude i main hpriest in pvp its hardly ever the meta as ye know
[3:12:08] shango007: not only arena
[3:12:20] kurokigensai91: true. ive always advocated for bans
[3:12:40] kurokigensai91: for example ban havoc
[3:12:55] kurokigensai91: and there you go. whole problem sovled
[3:12:56] shango007: can remember people running triple rogue for the MDI KEKW

[3:19:53] ROTKAMVP: hi, i have a little question, i would like to take back my mistweaveer but i don't know which spec to play, mistweaver or fistweaver? if you have time, could you tell me what are the pro/cons, it would be mostly for shuffle

[3:22:21] gregtehcow: ez as that
[3:22:53] kurokigensai91: ye. and maybe then that will give blizzard incentive to fix overtuned specs to allow them to play
[3:22:59] kurokigensai91: if the community bans them
[3:23:10] DuDuTheKobold: aand again LUL
[3:23:13] ROTKAMVP: I don't think there are enough players to do that
[3:23:25] l0lrev: i can barely play one spec, let alone 3
[3:23:44] kurokigensai91: if you ban havoc and rdrduid. you probably ban 80% of the playerbase. thats the only problem xD
