[0:20:52] ScienceVessel428: @MothmansGaming trufigcd, not a weakaura
[0:21:02] Grimey_George: Live, Laugh, Solo Shuffle
[0:21:09] Xenic0501: @ralvich I appreciate that! I drink multiple protein shakes a day. I have a fast metabolism. I used to drink most calories years ago but didn’t really help me out too much. Noticed more gains from eating most of my calories
[0:21:11] takhsick: bro you underestimate ppl online
[0:21:12] mixtapeX: u make your cold brew or buy it?
[0:21:14] takhsick: they buy anything

[0:25:11] Kushumakii: yeah cold brew is its own thing
[0:25:11] aTactical: @nskurn i only care about the caffeine though so sounds perfect
[0:25:18] sitosterolpvp: if you dont win the awc with Thug Cleave I will personally sponser your team with my company

[5:02:32] TheMysticGuy: TheMysticGuy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[5:02:34] drfeltgood: Dual streaming is not the move, The biggest thing that helps u is the chat interaction.. u cant do that on multistream.
[5:02:40] dermatoid: there are places that have twitch banned but youtube is allowed so you can get people from there....also don't you already have a channel for content they can just go from?
[5:02:40] HotTenderloins: His chat probably moves so fast he dgaf about reading chat

[5:03:14] PineTreesz: i mean it would cost like maybe 1k more in hardware to dual stream with out it effecting steam quality
[5:03:21] wiseimp: your value is your authenticity... and your herpes
[5:03:22] ZomgShamWow: viewbots
[5:03:26] chopsaki: .. crazy idea but what if .. twitch  gets shutdown.. everyone gonna run for youtubes to establish audeince
[5:03:29] mrbenzim: They worked up there
[5:03:30] scrubz778: thats u
[5:03:36] dermatoid: well what if you get more people watching on youtube? wouldnt it be convenient with your content already there?
[5:03:39] garzzyy: i mean look at asmon, he streams on an unmonotized channel LUL
[5:03:39] HotTenderloins: thats u

[5:04:44] kaasiii: that guy is definitely not a genius
[5:04:45] PineTreesz: asmonds system is he doesn't gaf about money.
[5:05:08] relaywow: Thats how the orgs leverage you to get sponsorships etc your viewership is a big part of it also why some of them help increase views etc in contracts
[5:05:25] garzzyy: Hes got the YT algo on lock
[5:05:32] lesuperspooky: Ayo take that shirt off and you'll jump up dawg. We gotchu.
[5:05:44] madexxm: @Pikabooirl hows boomy in solo shuffle?

[5:06:11] sup_tup1: W!!!
[5:06:12] tuggiesFTW: I think he's also gotten enough money that he isn't concerned about min/maxxing anymore
[5:06:18] sympathysong: you actually evolve past the chat itself.
[5:06:19] MissTeriousRex: same thing if you have 20k+ viewers, cant focus on all the chat scrolling so fast
[5:06:20] PineTreesz: i think you just ignore all chats besides the biggest platform
[5:06:28] foxtko: u cant read every chat anyway
[5:06:44] HotTenderloins: streaming is whatever you make it to be ig
[5:06:52] liddless: hustle culture
[5:07:01] callmeFROSTY2: Summit is good with his chat
[5:07:05] StatixEU: sup pika hope ur good homie
[5:07:06] wiseimp: Plenty of people aren't as engaged as you man...
