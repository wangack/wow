[7:55:05] streptomyces: @corexdk you think so? I mean I understand they bring other things to the table for sure, but I don’t think they do anything else better than other classes. Look at ww and uh dk, doing more dmg but no shroud

[7:55:22] rykhann: @Matgk At this point I think the best option would have to be some kind of class buff that interacts directly with other classes - for example, frost mages freeze opponents which increases Windwalker Monk damage specifically, etc. If the classes don't interact, you will always just bring the individually best class
[7:55:24] YukiTrip: @Matgk it wouldnt be an improvement because that wouldnt be the fastest possible time and the most optimal level of play if you limit class choices

[7:56:59] Avelstoon: @XaNoS113 i guess it depends if blizz is wanting speed runs or a viewing experience. personally I would prefer a better competition to watch with slower times but i can only speak for myself

[8:07:28] rykhann: @malaDur purely as a function of the patch cycle for an MMO - they can't really make sweeping changes to classes in the middle of an expansion, and major patches only come once every 6-12 months. I think they understand at this point that their dev cycle needs to change, I guess you get to choose if you're optimistic or pessimistic about that
