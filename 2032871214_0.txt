[0:40:00] waitimdesyncd: I have to turn hardware acceleration off to watch you btw. I think the toby eye tracker plugin bugs out the new adblockers that youtube are forcing to update, and it took me 2 weeks to figure out.

[0:42:38] GoldenA_: yeah lmao
[0:42:41] Nezzy243: feels like 30
[0:42:45] waitimdesyncd: @zachgamegodx sadly doesnt fix it, since its a plugin issue that bugs out with my adblocker
[0:42:55] mayfire15: it does on dps too lol

[0:43:42] sixthycent: barrier paired with daybreak is insane healing
[0:43:45] Laythos: its only 7 seconds in pvp
[0:43:45] waitimdesyncd: @Nezzy243  Well sure, if you dont want new people watching, then keep that attitude
[0:43:50] Laythos: its an awky cd
[0:43:56] sixthycent: daybreak, barrier, holy shock and flash
[0:44:08] sadccookie: barrier is nice does like 8-10% of ur healing
[0:44:14] Laythos: i mean like it doesnt line up with toll consistently
[0:44:15] mayfire15: pallys are def using 4 set lol

[0:45:21] Solastro: @mayfire15 from what ive seen 4pce, using crafted chest as set breaker
[0:45:27] zachgamegodx: chuck, this is proof that feral isn't b tier https://clips.twitch.tv/ComfortableBoredCattleOSfrog-vw3zIMX2do19X5Jc
[0:45:39] Neji513: do you think there are thirsty healers in stream waiting to snipe your pally?
[0:45:48] sadccookie: gives 8%dmg reduction too, and with the new 2set you don't need all the glimmers anymore it seems
[0:46:06] zachgamegodx: ok
[0:46:12] memph1s: yolo crit
[0:46:17] Nezzy243: feral feels like a glass cannon for sure, 300k bites but dies to piss
[0:46:26] zachgamegodx: 400k bites*
[0:46:36] waitimdesyncd: @Nezzy243  truly, with all due respect, who cares. I mentioned it solely because it took a while to figure out it had to do with eye tracker, and if it isnt being used anyway, then it might push away new viewers that are less knowledgeable. Its first of all not a big deal, and I was mostly thinking about others
[0:46:36] Nezzy243: 500k bites*
[0:46:52] misterblaht: 800k bites*
[0:46:53] zachgamegodx: im sad dew wont look at the clip

[1:52:10] VeTSEN7: does the tirant even do damage ? hes at like 30% hp when you cast it
[1:52:11] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Nether Portal s1 was so fun
[1:52:11] furtif_69: @RoundMangaming resetting cds

[1:55:24] zachgamegodx: i think the bile scourge bombers need to come in
[1:55:31] notdustinx: hard cast demo bolt?

[2:10:29] magixss: goes behind the largest pillar in world, gets in a 1v3 "fuck you guys doing"
[2:10:47] Solastro: goes behind pillar, doesnt use vanish, blames the team
[2:10:50] Solastro: classic sub rogue
[2:10:54] ChriswowTV: Tell him you're getting paid to play the game we love, living the dream. I'm jealous of you guys

[2:16:17] Infectshin1: any lobby dogs?
[2:16:21] Gundamentals: doesnt ur whole screen change colors
[2:16:37] lightz14: Why tho? they are so far ahead of the rest
[2:16:43] feerce24: yeah it’s the boarders
[2:17:02] sadccookie: if anything they should buff some of the other healers struggling
[2:17:27] magixss: they will nerf rdruid 1 day before AWC, the classico
[2:17:43] sadccookie: rdruid has already been nerfed plenty of times this xpac
[2:17:57] Solastro: not enoguh
[2:19:20] Thunder4o: Rdruid kit should be nerfed,not only % healing
[2:19:54] sanctusirl: Put clone on the same cd as rep
[2:19:57] dawsonator171: rdruids saccing vers for insane mastery and what it does for the healing is kind of silly. makes it fun to one shot though.

[2:21:17] biofreaks: Once they nerf rdruid, every will flock to pres probably. The circle of life.
[2:21:19] furtif_69: if you get rid of resto druid that graph is actually so balanced to be fair
[2:21:27] VinheGG: what are the comps for dev?
[2:21:30] snulli: what lock spec is strongest with sub rogue in 3s?
[2:21:34] clicket: @Thunder4o the logic is that they're master shapeshifters, so forcing a master shapeshifter to shift into another shape doesn't work
[2:21:41] Infectshin1: I was playing around with 2m infernal since shuffle games are shorter
[2:22:05] FoxiekittenWoW: @snulli depends what spec the rogeu is playing, if he is playing assa then you play affli if he plays sub you play destro
[2:22:13] Infectshin1: esp vs sub rogues, can kill their go with infernal stun alone
[2:22:18] Thunder4o: @clicket you just said nothing
[2:22:35] clicket: ok, lmao

[2:27:52] SteLawBro: Smeld is amazing. Losing your target is the most annoyying shit ever, esp at the end of a big cast when they are about to get smashed.
[2:28:01] Solastro: they need to add more flavor shit like that to all classes, zero power just cosmetic
[2:28:20] FoxiekittenWoW: @snulli he said earlier he doesn´t play 2s he doesn´t know whats a good 2s build
[2:28:23] sadccookie: i accidently added those legion tomes to my druid now i have shit on my stance bars i can't remove

[3:00:26] HolyXct: Carl already OOM... Oof i I would have tried playing convoke just to be able to play the mana game.
[3:01:10] Gwynbleidd710: Why is Prevoker so dogwater in 2s? Isn't the high damage and decent mobility theoretically good?
[3:01:14] hcrzealot: You play so mana efficient man
[3:01:20] knappster15: the mana gap was HUGE wow
[3:01:22] HolyXct: I tested convoke cat and Boomy, cat restores 30-35k mana while boomkin restores 20-25k.

[3:03:18] DentalDayum: how much did you get back that game @cdewx
[3:03:22] HolyXct: @cdewx ye that's what I am saying, I personally would of played convoke and try play the mana game if I was absterge.
[3:03:56] HolyXct: You sure? Mabye if they played different somehow?
[3:04:10] revid21: forced sterge to go shaman :)

[3:04:54] HolyXct: Well, I don't see a world where absterge can solve his mana problem unless they can cross cc for absterge to be able to gain some sips.
[3:04:57] Reizzy42: does pres counter r druid
[3:05:16] snulli: you are doing same healing and a lot more damage. he was oom and u were 180k mana
[3:05:17] dawsonator171: sub rogues are a good thing for the game.

[5:02:45] itz_killjoy: how is rude to ask someones age? what a stupid thing
[5:02:45] moistspeedo: how else do you make sure a women is over 18??
[5:02:46] kinkysdk: it's not rude, but making another person uncomfortable is not gonna help you
[5:02:47] parka_79: well you can, but it depends on if the person has any sort of personality to how they respond to it
[5:03:02] clicket: social norms people

[5:03:19] Zacaree55: You can ask a woman their age. Just dont bring it up directly as the first thing in conversation
[5:03:30] Zacaree55: Thats more of a bring it up casually mid convo type thing
[5:03:43] itz_killjoy: always ask a girl their age so u know they ain't under 18 what u mena
[5:04:10] Qtpiextclolz: if you have to ask - they're too young

[5:05:12] neverluckyil: its not rude, its normal question
[5:05:12] MaybeRespect: I usually just laugh and answer because I look younger.
[5:05:14] zarhoes: how is it odd? how is it normal to just go to someone random on the street and ask them their age out of the blue? its not bad its just weird/rude for some people
[5:05:17] JerryBuckx: Zoomers arent gonna get it man
[5:05:20] bigfathead: which is why you ask what year they finished highschool or something
[5:05:30] drummond777: what up dew
