[1:30:00] aminus: We will see PF nerfs in mythic week as no one played without pkagueborers
[1:30:02] dimofodi: All they did was create a second push week. There's just going to be 2 push weeks now. That's all they changed now.
[1:30:10] I_DoctorSatan_I: KSM is 2k raiting, where 1700 rating is a difference in 4 ilvls of upgrading gear through Valor for M+
[1:30:14] sh0tcaller615: the new mega dungion come out today?
[1:30:22] Aquadriel: nah, storming disappears if hit ssomeone and is like super slow @Towelliee

[1:30:24] OhNoNotAgain: @sh0tcaller615 no
[1:30:27] lumaday: no its just really slow and disappears when someone hits it. also they all go in the same direction now.
[1:30:29] BuddySinister: It always moves clockwise and leaves when it hits someone
[1:30:33] Dreadscore: how many attempts do u have on this?
[1:30:33] BrianSem: Anybody play legend of Aries back in the day, I was playing that when people were asking me to start playing wow in the beginning.
[1:30:34] jrossino: Imo they should take a time walking M+ every week from any old xpac to keep it fresh
[1:30:41] zetheex: Daggers are actually from alagon from uldir
[1:30:44] dimofodi: Storming moves slower, always goes clockwise, and despawns if it hits someone
[1:30:45] lumaday: yep
[1:30:48] Dalsonson: Storming moves in a tighter circle, goes away once hit, moves slower
[1:30:50] Aquadriel: yes
[1:30:54] dimofodi: Yep they do minimal damage as it is
[1:30:58] BuddySinister: melee or tank yeah
[1:30:58] atyllia: could Death's advance and just soak them

[1:31:09] lumaday: @atyllia nice
[1:31:15] mavis316: What time do servers go down?
[1:31:15] dimofodi: Storming damage was never an issue, their annoyance factor was
[1:31:25] I_DoctorSatan_I: 1700 rating is the ideal score to upgrade most of your gear w/o breaking ur back for 2k rating for 4 ilvls.
[1:31:27] magemaster225: the only real nerf left to do is lower the Last boss health on NW cause that fight takes forever on tyranical
[1:31:53] Manabucho: @Towelliee correct

[1:32:16] magemaster225: you can fail the timer on 18s on fortified and fail it on all 13s tyranical and get KSM
[1:32:19] abbosss: theyre trying to kill M+ lol

[2:33:53] Sollice: Why was Venthyr ever the worst for arms?
[2:34:06] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Algfader other way around. Her life is more important to go against time. That's why they had to re-create the 5th Element. :)
[2:34:06] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee mistakes were made XD
[2:34:46] KragnosWoW: its goin to feel weird comin back to retail and not having to worry too much about threat as dps

[2:35:54] Cello_73: 8 year, congrats!
[2:35:54] aeyt: You can still cause threat to be an issue, Immolation aura + fel rush on pull and youll be tanking as havoc :D
[2:36:05] Mecabeast: bdk needs a buff to autos not auras
[2:36:05] jhm89: @Towelliee Thoughts on Prot war in casual m+?
[2:36:05] KingSlayerYotam: Ill stay VDH, seems still good for m+
[2:36:20] headninja1ncharge: Just blood boil blood dk is so easy to play
[2:36:35] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Mecabeast I mean, honestly, Sinful Surge is best prob for PvP. Not so much for PvE. Night Fae or Kyrian are ideal for Raid and M+ respectively.

[2:37:00] CritcobainTV: Trill is most likely havoc DH this tier yeah?
[2:37:01] Hazno: @headninja1ncharge the problem is the low damage on Blood DK AoE in high AoE damage groups
[2:37:02] BuddySinister: WW will be used for provoke LUL
[2:37:05] abbosss: but he's a god at like every dps

[2:41:45] ANTRAUM: are we talking about the same trille? the one that streams and glad on every class? or is it a different trill
[2:42:09] KragnosWoW: So it seems like i should rush through new content on my hunter so when i work on my alt warrior i can get easy catch up gear
[2:42:12] I_DoctorSatan_I: @zer0c00ol depends on your content. Raiding or M+? Most Venthyr Warriors are for Raiding where NF or Kyrian are more M+ focus with strong covenant AoE abiltiies
[2:42:14] Hazno: @jhm89 ty! I'm trying to do a bit of research for a friend of mine who's thinking of picking up WoW again, and he used to play warrior way back in the days
[2:42:24] Thoreya: Trill aka god
[2:42:43] magemaster225: who are the limit tanks this time
[2:42:44] notdustinx: carried the entire raid team to gladiator in 2 weeks LOL

[2:43:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: @zer0c00ol Strong sustained multi-target and AoE damage with Whirlwind and Bladestorm for fights with multiple targets. This is where either Elysian Might or Signet of Tormented King's is deal. However, Signet still remains the best M+ lego over all other covenants.
[2:43:52] dravenmk: When those the patch come on your server i m from germany
[2:43:52] sinlesssinner: 2k this first season was getting sold to noobs for gear
[2:44:05] sinlesssinner: yea its what i am saying :)
[2:44:12] ANTRAUM: its not trillebartom is it?
[2:44:14] CritcobainTV: @sinlesssinner my man, hes saying trill was doing carries. not being carried. he carried his whole raid team to 2.4k in arenas LUL
[2:44:16] sinlesssinner: not comparing :p

[2:47:53] KragnosWoW: werent prot pally op in sunking
[2:47:54] I_DoctorSatan_I: @zer0c00ol overall, Venthyr is BEST Covenat for Fury if that's your going to be your main content.
[2:48:25] CritcobainTV: I've played up to 2300 with random people from LFG. I feel like with a little bit of coaching from some people with more experience i could be glad lol

[2:49:10] HotHotHeals: honor among boostes, i respect it
[2:49:17] therobbomega: yeah cause you need to win games every week
[2:49:19] Ambersulfr: I would be OK with boosters going away entirely.
[2:49:25] osatox: this time around boosters would have more business because ppl will need 1 win above the rating for upgrades
[2:49:31] Ambersulfr: I'm glad they're finally doing something about rating
[2:49:33] Cacos: Also prices will probably drop a little
[2:49:33] xDreadBeard: less incentive since PvP gear is worse in PvE
[2:49:37] Secondbreakfasttt: yeah cuz you said GG to that person already wintrading lmao
[2:49:40] therobbomega: so yeah, more business for them, and in turn more business for gold farmers
[2:49:42] I_DoctorSatan_I: @zer0c00ol Single Target > Venthyr (Raid). Multi-target > Kyrian. (M+)
[2:49:43] KragnosWoW: so if u dont keep up ur rating u cant wear the gear?
[2:49:44] Ambersulfr: there was no rating decay last season so if you bought it that was it
[2:49:44] therobbomega: and wow tokens

[2:53:32] I_DoctorSatan_I: Look, here's the thing. If you're already putting up good DPS numbers in your current 9.0 covenant, switching to another covenant in 9.1 for a extra 3% DPS isnt going to make a HUGE difference. I'm not switching Kyrian to NF for extra 3% DPS. I'm doing really well as Kyrian Fury with Signet of Tormented King's as it is.

[2:57:47] Sollice: @parsa1234567 There is no incentive for them to rush another GTA when RD2 made them boat loads and GTA Online is still making them oodles of cash

[3:05:57] Scraggersmeh: Honestly Blizz has a huge financial incentive to balance the factions and even make Alliance better so that people will switch over. They'd double if not triple their yearly revenue doing it.

[3:18:17] Comrade_Reaper: didnt xplit start just as Xfire died out?
[3:18:21] Masqerader: i remember using xsplit back in like 2011 I think for Battlefield

[3:19:47] Blah206: tbc servers are up
[3:19:49] Sollice: @jure__ Yeah thats why it will be a while before its openly available. h265 is the codec they use on events like TI, Riots stream etc. All of the internal streams.

[3:20:40] Phalamore: Phalamore subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 64 months, currently on a 64 month streak! 
[3:20:46] jure__: @Sollice everyone expects AV1 (or higher) to eliminate H265. but it's so demanding on hardware it's not very close
[3:20:49] DBtheAlien: @Amnesiac2170 they made upgrading any existing legendary add a socket. before it wouldnt.
[3:20:50] Comrade_Reaper: i still have to do thorgast on my mage and boomi ResidentSleeper

[3:20:57] Amnesiac2170: oh nice
[3:21:08] ElPolloBatman: the only blizzard news i believe is when lore drops something during bruv night while being drunk
[3:21:15] Sollice: @Towelliee The thing with the socket change is actually kind of concerning. How did anyone on the Blizz dev team was not able to anticipate the blow back from players. It's great that they relented, but troubling they even though it was something players would be remotely ok with

[5:37:03] Wildside1177: Aaradin

[7:24:14] ksands99: How would you grind that amount?
[7:24:16] KragnosWoW: "most alt friendly expansion" btw
[7:24:19] A_New_Challenger: To each their own - I play rogue and rogue...lol left my alts back in BFA - When my friends tell me they burned out in Shadowlands with all the renown and anima stuff for alts...I could only imagine how grindy that could get
[7:24:20] maalow: pretty sure 40 renown will be extremely fast

[7:25:08] Tequilawyrm: I think it's definitely a better alt friendly xpac than other recent xpacs
[7:25:23] A_New_Challenger: I don't know the answers, but I think they could have done for the valor system right out of the gate, but I think they really wanted to put a little fuel into pvp
[7:25:25] ZooNamiii: Limit Max was runnig PF for Renown and LFR give lots of Renown
[7:25:27] mwchaos: defintiely better than bfa

[7:55:36] dracullus: @Towelliee btw, if people think doing almost nothing for account wide flying is worse than paying for flying on every character.. I don't know what to say

[8:41:27] Kelticlore: IF they doa a legion Clasic ill wait till they do the .3
[8:41:30] ProverbX: WoD garrisons - lame. Raiding - S teir. Not needing to do chores - sick. Challenge modes -fun. Conclusion? pretty good?
[8:41:34] excessior: that was for AP grind
[8:41:36] ChalupaBatman25: @CasualCarvalho we are a long way from that, but idk if i'd play classic servers past wrath. that might be my cut off. after that its to close to modern wow post earth shattering

[8:41:48] Shezzmou: MoP was better than Legion i'll give you that but the dailies in MoP made me hate it at the time
[8:41:55] dutchie76: nightbane is easy
[8:41:56] un_original: the only good legion patch was 7.3, the rest was a fckign shit show to get there
[8:41:59] ShrenTheOrc: do you think when we get back to azeroth after shadowlands time will have passed and shit will be all fucked up
[8:42:00] ChalupaBatman25: @ProverbX wod garrisons would not of been that bad if it wasn't the central focus of an expansion it would of been awesome as just a side thing
[8:42:01] SirDurpington: lock seeds FTW

[8:44:13] KragnosWoW: @ChalupaBatman25 yeah that works sometimes, hard to find a good time where tanks and healers are online
[8:44:13] Keyastaron_: always
[8:44:14] fatherfrag: @Towelliee How long before the servers are said to be up?
[8:44:22] iblighters: Thrall has a bunch too
[8:44:23] MainlyHigh: the only problem is tbc is really old content so back in the day ther average player base wasnt that good at wow so nowadays people blow thru tbc content because its so easy vs retail content

[8:45:26] MickyFresc: Also Shadowlands has Anima grind which gives people something to do if they want to but not mandatory, and is designed for the whole expansion
[8:45:27] Shezzmou: just put a damn AH in major hubs lol
[8:45:44] Reydien: yeah, then before the next phase hits you'll farm them again for badges to buy the 1-2 BOJ items that get added that you want, and you don't even run the dungeons IN the phase

[8:46:06] MickyFresc: That's dope
[8:46:06] MainlyHigh: @dHinTrO its easy tbc is super easy to do all things in the game theres no skill caps like mythic and etc as well as we have sites now like icyveins so there is no spec confusion every plays the best so tbc is just easy vs retail wow whichj is more complex in every way \

[8:59:24] cazhually: hypesu
[8:59:32] mwchaos: def gonna use bdk cause they have best AMZ
[8:59:44] Reydien: double warrior seems like the only doubled up tank that would make sense, mainly for rallying cry
[8:59:52] andre_scb: how long until patch drops?
[8:59:52] mwchaos: yeee
[8:59:53] After43ver: all bear clear update inc
[8:59:58] coni_ary: any idea what to do first?
[9:00:00] KragnosWoW: blizz threw hunters in the trash just cuz they get sylvanas bow
[9:00:00] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee max just came on streaming we might be close!!
[9:00:02] almujrem: nha i don't think will be warri tank in raid fury venth lego is to good to pass on
[9:00:07] BubbaChubbs420: it is a 500 dps increase but might be harder to pull off for boomies
[9:00:12] Sollice: Boost DK with rally then pop AMZ
[9:00:15] mwchaos: it scales off health now though so you go bdk and stack hp from soul binds
[9:00:32] Bernardo994: i just wanna see some lore happen
[9:00:32] wazon_7: I feel like because guardian and boomkins are so strong, blizzard doesnt buff feral or resto druid to not make community go rampage on druids

[9:00:44] Dumpsterr: can warriors still get the crazy duration banners with covenant legendary that they could on ptr or has it gotten nerfed?
[9:00:59] darkligth_wow: @Towelliee yo
[9:01:00] BubbaChubbs420: @wazon_7 feral played right is actually good dude
[9:01:09] MrGattz: 2 minutes
[9:01:12] thunderioum: how long did you say?? @Towelliee
[9:01:14] Thrixel: B DK is worst tank for Mythic+ but decent OT
[9:01:14] MrGattz: for next ads
[9:01:19] wazon_7: could be said about every other spec literally @Bubbachubbs420
[9:01:28] Artighur: Prot Pally are so freaking fragile
[9:01:35] KragnosWoW: Paladin is S tier in dps out of the tanks tho Kappa
[9:01:40] Reydien: prot pally is the farm tank for speed-kill
[9:01:40] dHinTrO: don't worry, tbc is still here
[9:01:41] BubbaChubbs420: it is a high skill spec
[9:01:43] Austei: not sure what to play pally, dh or shaman
[9:01:58] BubbaChubbs420: feral is
[9:02:07] iblighters: Sloot went over all the numbers the other day and he would disagree
[9:02:12] MainlyHigh: true
[9:02:26] wazon_7: you get something for something. Prot pally is by far the highest dps tank, but lacks survi. There gotta be balance, cant make them more tanky without making them broken with their current tuning/kit
[9:02:27] doogs44: take away some utility if you have to just make them beefier.
[9:02:29] PhillyDilly18: They are a tank with a lower-case 'T' (compared to the others)
[9:02:31] Artighur: at least in BFA when SotR was up you were kinda safe
[9:02:38] iblighters: He can't say lol
[9:02:51] MainlyHigh: you have like 10% haste its almost impossible to not keep it up

[9:03:09] happybooger: he hasnt said yet, only that their guild will have a prot warrior and that wont be him slootLUL
[9:03:15] Thrixel: @Eraste bears have amazing dps and surv so yes
[9:03:25] Suwah84: Sloot said BDGG is prob running a Prot warrior with some other tank
[9:03:26] Medalink: Druid is god teir in M+, going to overtake DH this time
[9:03:27] wazon_7: give prot paladin something like anger managment for divine shield Pog
[9:03:28] heeyalex: Do you tink @Towelliee we will get new clases inn next expasjon :P
[9:03:30] mwchaos: their kit just isnt designed for rwf prog
[9:03:34] mwchaos: sadly

[9:04:25] Horseweave: Any thoughts on BM Monks this patch?
[9:04:26] reoki_: its not about how good a prot paladin is its about how many raid buffs are in the raid without it being a prot war or brm or vdh
[9:04:33] artiBEAST: 3 minutes until 6 hours max is surpassed.

[9:26:38] Zr0_gg: Feel like a 5-6 month content cycle is a realistic approach
[9:26:38] swordart_19: when are SERVERS UP CHAT ?
[9:26:51] BLACKFOOT_TN: Rats play rogues. Is canon.
[9:26:55] excessior: i found more dailies to do
[9:26:56] Samonasuke: i think the problem is that the people that dont have a lot of time get too far behind, having content or not, and they dont get invited or included in high tier raids and mythics cause the elitists gear-gate so much in WoW
[9:26:57] Amarlian: @swordart_19 When blizzard puts them up
[9:27:02] tigress75422: amazing how ppl don't read their launcher
[9:27:03] swordart_19: That is what i do 4Head

[9:27:26] xHukk: That show the game should be played.
[9:27:36] Thunder4o: @Towelliee ye but "some" tubers want us so much to believe there is next to non content in WoW...
[9:27:40] IianaDRK: @Samonasuke the player power stuff in shadowlands can be done over a week tho, u have to be incredibly casual to get behind with that, even then theres renown catch up

[9:28:19] Alepouditsa: @Rihula well i like to go there so i don't have to deal with ppl screaming at me if i do something wrong
[9:28:20] common_taco: I've just been leveling a lock on BC and enjoying my time

[9:28:38] chemicalshoup: I am a hypercasual with high playtime. I could do 100 a day early on
[9:28:38] Linruat: my biggest indicator of happiness in an expansion is the alt-friendly status...which is a big oof right now.
[9:28:39] coleslawwe: worse expansion
[9:28:40] artiBEAST: send them back to Suramar
[9:28:40] fezsmash: shit dont WQ
[9:28:45] Jokervenom1978: Ya Ive been anima farming WQs. lol

[9:29:05] Thunder4o: @Towelliee ye but "some" tubers want us so much to believe there is next to non content in WoW...
[9:29:06] dracullus: @Towelliee in BfA it was exactly opposite, raiders had reason to do world quests, casuals didn't
[9:29:06] Broomba: WQ dont have gear and weapons in SL compared to legion and bfa which i loved
[9:29:07] fezsmash: 1 lego and i was done

[9:30:14] jason_tacey: sock on head patch day
[9:30:17] Samonasuke: @Bjinc Im saying that people that aspire to be mythic/raiders but dont have a lot of time to grind out the gear to do so dont have the chance to experience it due to geargating by the players who do have all the time in the world
[9:30:20] xmedpakx: got me some Blantons
[9:30:28] skymercii: @Towelliee Corsair vs Razer? is it more preference or is there an actual better between the 2?

[9:31:15] skymercii: @Velladyn belluar is on
[9:31:17] skymercii: one
[9:31:23] IianaDRK: @Samonasuke its just a fact that doing mythic requires time to invest. even then its not a massive amount over a week. if u only have 37 seconds a week to play then u dont have the time to raid at all
[9:31:25] onous_: If you shit your pants you got the covid.
[9:31:28] Grady2385: @Towelliee remember back when you started to stream that your main was a warrior i miss those days man

[9:31:57] pasfomp: max is updating his game
[9:31:59] Etherdon: FFXIV is like WoW. The FF devs even admitted where they go their inspiration.
[9:32:05] TaNGoIX: I had to stop watching Bellular. His stuff became so annoying to watch - just him complaining constantly.
[9:32:06] KragnosWoW: "How Pepsi Max made me choose 9.1 over FF"
[9:32:09] Broomba: seriously does he or has Bellular played FF14?
[9:32:11] subluxt7: I await the inevitable server stability issues KappaPride

[9:32:44] luckfore: restart bnet maybe
[9:32:47] Lonan_Reigns: Mooofa
[9:32:49] skymercii: can i still get IO this week? or is it not worth doing keys
[9:32:56] pasfomp: sorry I didnt knew you already did it, my bad @Towelliee
[9:32:58] MainlyHigh: i like bellular but he hopped on the hate train for views thats forsure all he his videos he shits on wow behind the illusion he just wants the game better but we all know he will making 100 9.1 videos and will wait for the majorities view on the game and then hop on that train

Vacceines do not prevent you from catching things, like a flu shot. it just prepares your body to deal with it and makes your case way milder...which is most importent when we venture into making sure your case is not "life threatening"
