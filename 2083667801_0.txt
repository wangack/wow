[2:19:04] runkle27: will come when there will be generalized digital identities
[2:19:21] inzightzz: @cdk058 you have to buy a 70+ euro dlc every 2 years at least if you play retail
[2:19:31] tftouched: just give the chinese company your id YEP
[2:19:35] ash____h: Maybe cause Smile gate have access to KR citizen data, but there's no way Blizzard can have Citizen Data of the entire world xD
[2:19:41] blakee199: Spergatory
[2:19:43] WunchleR: league has that now too

[2:20:07] rawlexdota: Dota 2 report system is pretty accurate, but nothing is perfect
[2:20:12] blurst_: being toxic in dota is an artform
[2:20:14] lsdeeezus: dota 2 behavior system is utter garbage
[2:20:17] blurst_: not everyone can master it
[2:20:20] jokaa199: bots are good for blizzard?

[2:21:18] inzightzz: @cdk058 yes its next level greed in a buy to play game with monthly sub and a cash shop
[2:21:28] frikken2: @JokerdTV üë¥ KEKW
[2:21:32] rawlexdota: Ill up[load a video soon, ive been to every farming bots zone there is, there so many
[2:21:57] Vax1: @frikken2 Pog the legend
[2:22:00] Chockerande: Got that spirit of alpha rune? Otherwise go to freewind post and get it
[2:22:04] MDHippie: Blizzard has said multiple times they don't profit from bots because they are either hacked accounts, or had a subscription in countries like Argentina where the sub price was much, much lower
[2:22:08] CojL: I mean, bots bring revenue
[2:22:10] fwankey: of course
[2:22:10] ShadowSE1: Or they let it get worse, and then sell you the solution in form of gold
[2:22:13] Jeff8711: they don't ban bots cuz they pay a subscription
[2:22:33] CojL: @MDHippie Thats partly true but imagine 200k accounts, do you really think theres no profit?
[2:22:36] rawlexdota: Yday i spent 1 hour farming bots, gaining honor in dustwallow, there are so many xD
[2:22:40] YzieGG: just use ai to detect bots its not that hard only cost money
[2:22:47] Lolfloboy: i‚Äôd rather have bots than limit my gameplay
[2:22:56] jokaa199: Bots are the only ones who do skinning and mining
[2:22:59] Ghoulplayerx: "So you want us to ban a money income from the game, make that make sense to me" ICANT
[2:23:16] cook_pc: put a captcha on the vendors
[2:23:26] inzightzz: 'muh privacy'
[2:23:28] Wadjaah: Did you guys feel an impact on bots with their new system they talked about for p2?
[2:23:28] ndras: it would take an hour per day of GMs time to purge realms
[2:23:38] Korupcija_: they ban 200k bots a month, that's 2 million dollars for free
[2:23:42] lurkbelow82: americans get triggered by that, they wont do it
[2:23:42] jokaa199: w check every 30 min^^
[2:23:56] mohrree: @cook_pc BASEDCIGAR
[2:23:58] jokaa199: gms in 2k24
[2:23:58] Exillia: depends on the form of verification, i wouldn't like giving my social security number like they have to in korea
[2:24:00] samuello94: They could require phone number
[2:24:02] ggbr0sky: imagine how healthy yhe econemy would be without bots
[2:24:08] tobiasdoublep: then we will have verified accounts being hacked
[2:24:12] runkle27: you can buy fake id for coinbase and shit i'm sure they will bypass this easliy
[2:24:24] TheExist256: verified accounts are usually automated
[2:24:29] bleezy16: maybe you could get some captcha once a day on your screen to chceck if ur bot, if you wouldnt respond for like 5 times you get autobanned
[2:24:36] Vecth: As someone who works on the back end and industries for banks trust me they only check that s*** every 2 to 4 years
[2:24:38] panzorr: just dont get hacked 4Head
[2:24:42] rawlexdota: Is hard to control it, people will always be 1 step ahead of blizzard in these situations, they always find a way and until blizzard fix it, they find another way and so on, it is impossible
[2:24:58] buIindora: its really the gold buying that is the ultimate problem.

[2:25:12] shadotdow: Bots ensure a healthy ingame economy
[2:25:12] HeGedzio: @rawlexdota its about scale not the fact that u cannot 100% eliminate it
[2:25:15] Dz3ro: is it me or you said the story about verified accounts multiple times already PogO?
[2:25:20] buIindora: RMT is purely the reason bots exist
[2:25:33] Exillia: In korea, your account is linked to your social security number, that's why it works
[2:25:36] sj0kken: subathon when?
[2:25:41] ash____h: but KR is a single country, Blizzard have to do it for the whole world xD
[2:25:41] Exillia: that would never work in europe
[2:25:52] buIindora: people buy way more than gold they buy chracters, and buy boosts which incentivizes botters
[2:25:54] notdxsty: not "purely" people would bot tasks that are monotonous to do - like fishing, ranking, etc
[2:25:58] ggbr0sky: in korea its in the goverment law
[2:25:58] Acrobatica: @jokerdtv what you find?
[2:25:59] kubbins: nah

[2:27:39] earlyseasoneric: gotta hit demand
[2:27:40] Vax1: @zeburnaa u sure they aint Indonesian?
[2:27:40] einself111: best solution would still be perma ban gold buyers without warning
[2:27:46] Chockerande: The Rune is on a mushroom shaped rock south of freewind post.
[2:27:54] bleezy16: soylution iKEK
[2:28:00] ELectraa69: bots are working... for extra sub SeemsGood

[2:28:09] KiwiGuy17: Blizz doesn't want to ban because they want the monthly subscription
[2:28:12] vohtoi: people just get MAC spoofers to avoid it
[2:28:16] iNKWERK: @Razzerlol ele is almost as good as enhance wdym? look at rankings on warcraft logs
[2:28:20] egiop97: @rawlexdota until you get caught yes
[2:28:25] inzightzz: if they perma banned rmters then half the playerbase would be gone kek
[2:28:26] pudnpopz: shadowban their ass, make them think they're playing the game
[2:28:29] YzieGG: or at least delete the char that bought gold
[2:28:31] ash____h: They already gave a BS answer to that question
[2:28:31] LucaStahl: bots are running in VMs, IDs mean nothing
[2:28:31] HideLemonsYo: nice haircut jokerd
[2:28:31] Schwabernaut: for ele shaman, u flame shock, lava burst, lightening bolt spam until fllame shock is fall off and LAvaburst on CD
[2:28:33] ggbr0sky: i got banned 2 weeks
[2:28:33] bleezy16: bots are lirly free money for them so why would they ban em
[2:28:36] Kiewicz92: remember swifty ban? kekw

[2:28:46] rawlexdota: @egiop97 yeah but, that is such a small percentage of ppl that they do get caught

[2:29:08] kotharferreiro: hey Jokerd, do the 100% exp buff that comes out yesterday, stack with the 3% increase exp from the sleeping bag?

[2:48:22] DaaamnTV: raid was too hard, so scrubs left the ship early
[2:48:22] The_Longcat: I didn't enjoy the new zones
[2:48:23] bleezy16: Baseg
[2:48:23] SlackieG: For me i went from unlimited mana for healing in wrath to no mana in 5 casts at the start of the xpack

[2:49:30] loofers: bleezy: ok there retail bro

I'll have you know that as we speak a full team of highly specialized twitch lawyers is studying this case and will bring justice. Maybe now you will think twice before denying a pyramid.

[5:31:08] arxi0: its mythic KJ an it aint even close
[5:31:11] Dissolution187: Imagine struggling on HLK with 200 WA's and 30% buff ICANT
[5:31:11] Demobalderes: this is also 20 min
[5:31:13] beastfroma: @kharma99 Well big wigs is one thing. And i assume its  not on retail Mythic lvl ?
[5:31:13] Rikkerdine: hc lichking is so easy there 2-3things to look for

[5:31:40] kharma99: @beastfroma HoF = Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame = first 200 guild in world to kill mythic end boss
[5:31:42] PeasantNoMore: Think hc lk is just overtuned when it comes to dmg/hp. Rag has that + more mechanics imo
[5:31:42] brennhet: mate ppl struggled with kt/vash prenerf dosent mean the content is hard

[5:32:09] moiztzaz: eveyrthing you see here is 1 mistak wipe
[5:32:13] Bedreten: @JokerdTV what do you think if they ban GDKP in cata?
[5:32:14] grillparty1992: bro, this is way harder then LK KEKW @JokerdTV

[5:32:16] just_a_slayer: @immortalllz that's just not true stop lying
[5:32:17] immortalllz: last bosses in raid is harder for sure
[5:32:18] Evolutionsx: @JokerdTV do you think they'll do pre-nerf cata heroics?

[5:40:26] Vexstrasza: game only became hard when parsing became a thing
[5:40:26] NotXasmur: kek ImTyping kek
[5:40:32] stormyweatherr: people don‚Äôt wanna feel like they aren‚Äôt the best iKEK
[5:40:32] bonyato: t5 was decently hard
[5:40:34] Bral23: Mythic is so insane for all but the 1% of players
[5:40:39] veiloflonelystars: yes it does when heroic gear was only a bit better than normal
[5:40:43] flebbooo: Razaget
[5:40:43] megadorkdan: YEP
[5:40:52] veiloflonelystars: normal gear was enough when heroic gear was barely 10% better
[5:40:52] LightBladeStream: turd weak
[5:40:58] xxrocher: xaryu did it :)
[5:41:03] urmadlife: xaryu did
[5:41:07] MontiEvill: i did algalon but didnt Anub Arak, and as a warrior tank player wont play until MoP ok
[5:41:09] ggbr0sky: ofc not
[5:41:12] veiloflonelystars: cata/mop had the best raiding dynamic 10/25 and normal/heroic
[5:41:14] LightBladeStream: it is
[5:41:23] veiloflonelystars: 2 should be all we have
[5:41:26] icylemons1993: M.
[5:41:29] Demobalderes: PTR is to blame for how hard raids are, if PTR didn't exist they could make the raids much easier and still have them be cleared in the same time frame @JokerdTV no CAP
[5:41:35] DeleldurTV: Insnely hard my ass, my guild did it week 4 and it only took us that long because christmas break
[5:41:35] flebbooo: @veiloflonelystars BASED
[5:41:37] melvinguyy: agree, make it decently hard and only have ONE mode
[5:41:41] Randomfear: gear is same in cata for 10 and 25 ma
[5:41:43] icylemons1993: KEKBASED
[5:41:48] knats19: less is more
[5:41:49] Hyper_Dan: And then all the groups want the heroic achievement on week 2 as a requirement to join KEKW
[5:41:51] Ak11ra: 10 hc is bis
[5:41:52] hembris: LFR is still the worst thing blizz ever adde
[5:41:56] veiloflonelystars: @Randomfear another reason why that system was great
[5:41:57] ggbr0sky: no ur not
[5:41:59] icylemons1993: your awesome dude
[5:42:03] urmadlife: The whole idea of bllizard adding or removing mechanics inbetween dificulties was ultra lame
[5:42:05] weckod: nah 4 modes in retail fucking sucks
[5:42:08] LightBladeStream: ICANT
[5:42:12] membaberrytv: @JokerdTV did you go left to boars to get to razorflank for the tattered note?
[5:42:13] LightBladeStream: LFR doesn't affect u lil bro
[5:42:14] veiloflonelystars: 4 modes is too much, takes any value out of the raid
[5:42:24] Luucatoo: is it the same loot from 10m than 25m in cata??? @JokerdTV
[5:42:29] urmadlife: lfr is a disenchanting farm
[5:42:36] veiloflonelystars: normal mode should be there for 80% of players and heroic/mythic should merge in dificulty and only be a single one
[5:42:36] melvinguyy: it divides the community even more, having so many different modes
[5:42:38] stormyweatherr: @luucatoo ye
[5:42:43] paladan_tich: LFR is good for my kids whoa re 8 and 10
[5:42:51] flebbooo: They should make LFR like it was in wod, where it gave u shit gear and no tier sets
[5:42:52] bleezy16: lfr is lirly harder than normal cuz only lirly braindead players doin flr
[5:42:55] Vexstrasza: LFR was added to keep the $$$ coming in for the avg player
[5:42:56] RedSniper6: LFR was like pugs back in the day, They rarely worked. Maybe with people being older and understanding the game more LFR will be slightly better odds.
[5:42:57] babam_ow: go normal Madeg
[5:42:59] LightBladeStream: @melvinguyy forcing everyone to play the same content is why Gnomer sucks
[5:43:02] veiloflonelystars: bro but the gear wasn't that big of a diference
[5:43:06] veiloflonelystars: same in cata
[5:43:11] urmadlife: Just do normal ReallyNice
[5:43:13] veiloflonelystars: so normal gear was still good
[5:43:16] hembris: yesa
[5:43:16] causemosmvp: Back when I was playing in 2007 there were people who were stuck in dungeon gear and they never cried about not getting BIS. Now even Jeff who plays wow for 8 days wants to get bis items lol
[5:43:18] ggbr0sky: just 1 raid difficulty thats it
[5:43:19] urmadlife: nah
[5:43:21] Yukela: best gear from heroic, mythic is only prestige
[5:43:22] aoe_enjoyer: that sounds ok
[5:43:22] I_eat_fried_chicken: there should be just 2 difficulties
[5:43:22] arran564: nah
[5:43:23] egiop97: @veiloflonelystars COPIUM
[5:43:26] veiloflonelystars: nah, 2 dificulties is bis
[5:43:29] Tjamen: i like that personally
[5:43:29] hembris: people can just kill the end boss the next patch.
[5:43:35] urmadlife: 1 raid diff whit buffs KEEEEEEEEK
[5:43:49] coastzilla: everyone takes gnomer too seriously
[5:43:53] eshonxv: make bosses hard and if u suck u suck
[5:43:56] LightBladeStream: Kinda how retail works. You can upgrade normal gear to Heroic
[5:43:57] Demobalderes: PTR is to blame for how hard raids are, if PTR didn't exist they could make the raids much easier and still have them be cleared in the same time frame @JokerdTV no CAP YEP
[5:43:57] Bral23: Yeah if they did hard mode for normal it could work
[5:44:01] klajklaj: cata waiting room when
[5:44:04] Sunderwire_: mythic gnomer Pog
[5:44:04] urmadlife: heroic gnomer KEKWait
[5:44:07] kingcrazEEEEE: i hope they bring hc and mythic to SOD
[5:44:11] ggbr0sky: it just splitts the commuity
[5:44:14] Vessdyn: have you ever played Elden Ring? @JokerdTV
[5:44:15] veiloflonelystars: cata/mop had one of the most active and enjoyable raiding communities the game EVER HAD
[5:44:20] causemosmvp: WHY should they clear it?
[5:44:21] melvinguyy: @LightBladeStream i dont agree personally, i think its fun and in 60 we will hopefully have plenty of content
[5:44:24] coastzilla: idk why there's no middle ground with people
[5:44:29] thughesy: what‚Äôs hardest raid in cata?
[5:44:29] veiloflonelystars: barely 10% of pop raid current mythic raiding
[5:44:40] arran564: shield
[5:44:41] bahrundota: LUL
[5:44:43] ganklust: What's mythic
[5:44:43] jeneraljelly: belt is good
[5:44:46] Nenea93: hard raids contribute faster  burnout also
[5:44:47] urmadlife: Heroic modes should have allways stay as optative in the boss encounter as in ulduar instead of whatever TOC is
[5:44:48] PutMeInCoachPls: Following that thought it leads to having Mythic raiding for hardcore players and Normal raiding for casuals. Back to retail @JokerdTV
[5:44:53] Tweek1987: Hardest boss was vanilla naxx  .   Four horseman saph KT.
[5:45:08] hembris: @veiloflonelystars i think its mostly due to it being very unrewarding to do.
[5:45:13] wakeandbacon95: pepeJAM catJAM
[5:45:14] causemosmvp: most people didnt even raid
[5:45:15] arran564: NOPERS
[5:45:16] Bral23: Yeah
[5:45:16] Suferon: no
[5:45:18] flebbooo: no
[5:45:18] urmadlife: nah
[5:45:18] PutMeInCoachPls: In Classic 2019? Yes
[5:45:18] Tudahu: bro no
[5:45:22] LightBladeStream: 2019?
[5:45:25] PutMeInCoachPls: In Classic 2019? Yes most people did it im pretty sure
[5:45:37] eshonxv: shroud spent like 12 hours on 4hm iirc
[5:45:38] bingopingo0: hey jokerd I saw bob got an acting gig as a chocolate bartender for the wonka experience! She did really well and I‚Äôm proud of her :)
[5:45:38] PutMeInCoachPls: In Classic 2019? Yes most people did it im pretty sure. I was in a casual guild and we eventually kil;led KT
[5:45:38] stormyweatherr: sapph without wb Aware
[5:45:38] chozzle_: ez
[5:45:39] a25zkmiz: forse men forsenE
[5:45:41] pastterino: naxx was only hard due to consumables
[5:45:42] maro_haro: Do you think that they should normalise difficulty to vanilla/tbc for cataclysm and make only 1 difficulty of the raids ?
[5:45:46] Hyper_Dan: Hard raids should give achievement and a rank on a leaderboard rather than providing better gear, so itwould be the ultimate challenge to measure PPs for those people.
[5:45:50] veiloflonelystars: @hembris ye cause the systems are fcked, back in cata/mop they were better
[5:45:54] urmadlife: but 40 man raiding made it harder cause getting 20 dudes whit a brain is hard
[5:45:55] Tweek1987: We wiped bck in the days for 3 months on 4 hourseman , guild disband
[5:46:02] bleezy16: best difficulty raid that ive ever played was heroic nathria, felt good to progress, first bosses easy, last 3 hard but doable, nathria was best rad blizzard ever made dont @ me
[5:46:04] Brelshar: Skill issue
[5:46:06] veiloflonelystars: 2 = bis
[5:46:17] dad_kek: @bleezy16
[5:46:25] JuveEU: Naxx in SoD gonna be omega scaled to casual lvl
[5:46:26] a1exfar: yes
[5:46:29] real_spin: ppl were bad and many guilds didnt minmax class stack KEKW
[5:46:29] urmadlife: @bleezy16 KEEEEEEEEK
[5:46:30] hembris: @veiloflonelystars I agree.
[5:46:30] egiop97: @bleezy16 @bleezy16
[5:46:33] LightBladeStream: @bleezy16 I loved progging HC Nathra, same
[5:46:53] Demobalderes: Ofc dads didn't do it
[5:46:58] Dissolution187: @JokerdTV But not all gear saves you in fights... Look at HLK... People can wipe you so easily with all bis gear basically.
[5:47:05] weckod: @bleezy16 amazing raid
[5:47:14] urmadlife: i just wish the way in which blizzard manages raid diff wasnt so cut and dry menu change
[5:47:16] Ryafl1: whirl buffs
[5:47:20] hapjaa: Tomfoolery
[5:47:35] stormyweatherr: Tomfoolery
[5:47:39] bonyato: xdd
[5:47:41] real_spin: I was in raid where we were wiping for hours on saph and every time we wiped we went back for wbs KEKW
[5:47:41] urmadlife: it should be optative changes to make the base difficulty harder
[5:47:49] Vexstrasza: some dad guilds still failing to kill gnomeregan last 2 bosses
[5:47:50] veiloflonelystars: thats what normal should be,
[5:47:53] veiloflonelystars: bro
[5:47:55] Brelshar: Then get better at the fucking game.
[5:47:57] stormyweatherr: just get good
[5:48:05] LightBladeStream: That's a terrible mindset tho, youre not supposed to have bis
[5:48:06] stormyweatherr: ReallyNice
[5:48:12] Myndtricks: ok
[5:48:15] urmadlife: just get good ReallyNice
[5:48:17] Firebloom: IF you work for 2 hours sohuld you get the same pay as someone who works for 8 hours?
[5:48:17] arran564: true
[5:48:25] Dissolution187: Some people probably just enjoy playing with friends. Personally, I find the fun in the difficulty.
[5:48:30] Syndrab: Hoooly, based takes
[5:48:33] YourPegas: Drunk
[5:48:36] urmadlife: @Firebloom good thing videogames are not jobs ReallyNice
[5:48:36] just_a_slayer: addons dont do the mechanics do you, these boomers can't physically move their fingers properly
[5:48:37] megadorkdan: docRant 3rd party thing
[5:48:37] veiloflonelystars: back in cata/mop the ilvl diference was much better handled, the past raid heroic become the next raid normal ilvl
[5:48:38] therattmoth: different mounts for achievements at different difficulties too...not just gear
[5:48:39] SlowboLaggins: @Firebloom if you do something more important yeah
[5:48:39] a1exfar: if you don't have guild and just leveled - LFR is ok to see starting mechanics and gear variety
[5:48:48] tanner532: echo and limit pay people to make WA
[5:49:00] wavecadet: thats not even hard really
[5:49:03] wavecadet: takes like 1 day to set up lol
[5:49:07] LightBladeStream: @just_a_slayer They have a 3 second GCD on their button presses KEKW
[5:49:09] melvinguyy: does the trinket swap still cost 65g? the pearl trinket from bfd
[5:49:10] RedSniper6: Hardmode is not causal
[5:49:14] Brelshar: Then they can have the worse version of gear, its not hard.
[5:49:19] eshonxv: yep
[5:49:22] kswissbaby: retail is hard as shit lol
[5:49:23] YourPegas: YEP

[5:49:34] Ak11ra: setting ui is best part of the game imho
[5:49:37] Dissolution187: @JokerdTV If people put in the effort, watch videos on how to do fights, how to min max their character they WILL get better.
[5:49:38] stormyweatherr: xdx

[5:49:50] ParfumAmerican: Evening Joker - nice haircut!
[5:49:51] Firebloom: @SlowboLaggins and what is considered imporant?
[5:50:01] wavecadet: if someone shows you how, its easy
[5:50:04] wavecadet: if you dont have guidance, youre fucked
[5:50:11] tekilol: do we know if Cata hero DJ gonna be prenerf or with the nerfs ?
[5:50:13] LightBladeStream: People who want to get better will look up guides, those guides will lead them further down the road of addons etc
[5:50:18] urmadlife: no friends no ui no raid no parse SadCat
[5:50:27] zacharyzorbas: omgawd i'm overwhelmed

[5:50:56] urmadlife: rdf in H dungeons is a wipe
[5:50:56] Raivan994: first pull of deepholme was something
[5:50:56] demiNEET: Grim Batol pre-nerf KEKInsane
[5:50:56] PeasantNoMore: It was more due to RDF and ppl being bad
[5:50:57] wakeandbacon95: in the beninging
[5:50:59] Edhards: I asked how bm eventworked and people started saying that im dumb and dont know how to read even the players make the game more dificult to play

[5:51:34] zacharyzorbas: wrath in general sux asss
[5:51:37] lord_windir: Hardest dungeon is Grim Batol
[5:51:37] Dissolution187: @JokerdTV Do you agree that if people put in the effort to learn their class, watch videos on the bosses, and play often they will get better? I think people are too lazy to put in the effort, so they stay bad.
[5:51:37] just_a_slayer: they wont be
[5:51:45] stormyweatherr: wotlk in general iKEK
[5:51:48] YzieGG: in cata there are more dungeons like forge of souls

[7:04:59] FrankYE1990: 70 or 17?

[7:05:39] aoe_enjoyer: ST was given a 3day lock out and an id
[7:05:49] tevona: @JokerdTV i dont think sunken is good for raid, being skippable whereas mara is kinda linear and better for raid
[7:05:57] veiloflonelystars: ST makes sense cause they can make 8 solid bosses, brd would be epic but its too much for them
[7:05:57] Hawiii: @JokerdTV lvl 40 to 50 will be so fast if ZF is not a raid
[7:05:58] timmyslapper123: either mara or st last boss is going to be cool as a raid

[7:07:53] nicowow007: Brain melt Aware
