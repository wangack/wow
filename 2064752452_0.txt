[2:14:02] p3anots: I cut my hair last year, and it felt sooo much better, saved a lot of shampoo as well LUL
[2:14:11] Aka_Gami: its not like buzz but its short again like 1.5 inches on top. i didnt notice how much pony tail s pulling on my head kinda hurt
[2:14:16] Pahnkee: try and lay it back real quick :D
[2:14:20] Greasy_Doug: I got mine cut shorter in stages to see how i liked it at different lengths

[2:22:46] Kentrosthc: atleast in any mmo pvp ive played
[2:23:21] framples: I went arms with the mace and just didnt get mortal strike from arms and went crit in the other tree
[2:23:25] Limp4ns: the mace has 1% crit tho, but yeah

[2:24:38] sdjfn: my man overcooked
[2:24:45] p3anots: Oh cool
[2:24:46] moby_slick: MS is a key part of pve rotation?
[2:24:52] p3anots: SWEEP THIS
[2:25:18] feardotrun: too much bursts
[2:25:19] kindNifti: I agree
[2:25:20] IrisFromAlaska: yeah
[2:25:20] moby_slick: yes
[2:25:20] feardotrun: burst'
[2:25:28] retox248: they should away them with old
[2:25:29] kindNifti: slow it down, too much
[2:25:31] itsPerkii: more passives but same pacing
[2:25:32] danishdezzak: I feel like mor utility would be cooler
[2:25:33] Limp4ns: yeah more talent passives less abilitys
[2:25:36] MfSmex: They should add passive stuff
[2:25:37] retox248: swap*
[2:25:38] Lyrian117: abilities are fine - the high dps burst is the issue
[2:25:38] konagosk: add more
[2:25:39] p3anots: Yea, for most, but warrior isn't really getting anything so would be nice for them to get stuff
[2:25:40] DrLegend305: I agree
[2:25:40] popzirl: meh its not gonna feel like retail cmon lol
[2:25:45] mavrayeth: slow down, lvl 60 theres going to be too many new abils we prob wont use old ones the way its going
[2:25:47] Skrimij_: as long as they keep class identity it’s fine but tbh mages shouldn’t be able to heal..
[2:25:48] danishdezzak: Warrior with Stormbolt etc. ranged stun
[2:25:50] kindNifti: yeah, that would make sense
[2:25:51] Aka_Gami: like the idea of adding new class themes (mage healing) and some powerups, but they shouldnt just throw every ability ever on a rune
[2:25:52] rourfoses: gonna have to get a second keyboard for key bindings at this rate
[2:25:54] AsteroidsBlue: warr need to catch up for sure
[2:26:00] Frig0z: As long as they don't add a ton of random procs & scaling factors like retail... should be ok
[2:26:10] veiloflonelystars: ^
[2:26:14] fremling: @SONII how long do you think that SOD going be a live on p3 late game
[2:26:23] veiloflonelystars: yes, its the procs in retail that f everything
[2:26:24] sdjfn: I mean I wouldnt mind a spear of bastion for pvp but they should also be careful with what they are adding
[2:26:26] Limp4ns: the more retail it is the worse warr feels lol
[2:26:45] feodred10: what’s your favorite ghost ED?
[2:26:46] GregWasTaken: read the future
[2:26:55] WcWillow: next phase is 50 right?
[2:27:02] not_vern: 3 months because then phase 4 drops
[2:27:03] Skrimij_: if they are adding retail abilities they need to change the spell effects, that’s where retail went wrong it’s too cartoony
[2:27:17] framples: hey soni can you tell blizz to juice us up thanks
[2:27:26] feodred10: strawberry warhead has my wanting to run thru walls
[2:27:27] skizzington: do you regret leveling warrior for this phase?
[2:27:33] nextlvlshyt: what do you think about the blood moon weapons for warriors?
[2:27:37] feardotrun: 6 weeks if we're lucky.. prolly more like 8 to 9 weeks

[2:28:37] feardotrun: lead dev mains a pally he dont give a shit bout warrior
[2:28:47] mavrayeth: lacking the fun
[2:28:49] veiloflonelystars: first phase was 8 weeks, thats not long at all its good time
[2:28:49] blakeshow: think they need more passives rather than more actives to press for runes
[2:29:01] feodred10: you said 6 more weeks of this one phase? wasn’t phase 1 month’s long?
[2:29:03] veiloflonelystars: 6 weeks maybe
[2:29:07] blakeshow: he hinted at making new content
[2:29:19] veiloflonelystars: ye 8 weeks
[2:29:22] Cjpriest: yeah but the lvl cap was 25
[2:29:23] Sparkel: p1 was soooo longggg
[2:29:35] Cjpriest: it should be longer than p1 by a wide margin
[2:29:37] veiloflonelystars: p1 should have been 4-6 weeks and this one 8 weeks
[2:29:42] retox248: same
[2:29:53] sdjfn: The pvp event in stv is also a lot more interesting
[2:29:59] sdjfn: If they keep improving it

[2:30:18] creaturesfan72: i hope they add more rewards, warlock just has rings and a trinket

[4:50:39] grumpy_pants83: not played retail in forever
[4:50:40] not_vern: I dont know how it isnt a thing! Seems like it can fit the lore
[4:50:42] Qpoof_TV: undead druid gief
[4:51:13] Selecktt: Undead paladin would be a direct contradiction to the established lore and require a ton of retconning and disrespecting the entire story. So it's pretty inline with what blizz would do and I expect to see it in war within
[4:51:27] rotbodi: undead on cat mounts all that matters
[4:51:28] Swolbasaur: skeletal rat

[4:56:13] sugawolf92: thats warlock set
[4:56:27] Swolbasaur: How do you do that?
[4:56:29] EggsotiX: This is a classic
[4:56:48] Wooshu: its about 5-6% dmg reduction overall
[4:56:51] dj_efx: 42% is a big nerf soniiFail
[4:56:53] z3boss: it was big bro
[4:56:56] z3boss: love it
[4:57:08] Wooshu: other skills got buffed to compensate
[4:57:20] dj_efx: 10% buff to compensate 42%
[4:57:31] Wooshu: so all in all probably about 6% nerf to SPriest dmg overa;;
[4:57:31] phaydeaway: reserving the whole loot table
[4:57:43] Iol69: i did a bfd the other day on alt and leader was still doing master loot lol
[4:57:49] SecretStonaw: 10% increase to mind spike
[4:57:59] thetosis: they will be fine just like balance
[4:57:59] gmar_07: mind spike doesnt really hit alll that hard
[4:58:03] dj_efx: im just hating. blizzard likes to overnurf
[4:58:06] gmar_07: its the mind blast from the mind spike stacks
[4:58:19] tedi95: spriest is still a god class in pvp, no matter the runes
[4:58:21] dj_efx: healing is still great on priest
[4:58:36] xdeeds: Not in SOD, it's World of Oneshots
[4:58:37] gmar_07: hot take but I do not feel like SW:D is a big deal against geared 40s
[4:58:42] veiloflonelystars: thin is if all things are buffed then it can become to a point beyond broken
[4:58:45] xdeeds: Buff HP too then
[4:58:46] phaydeaway: they already buffed the classes with runes and the game feels worse than era idk
[4:58:50] gmar_07: its the under geared people that it hits hard on
[4:58:58] Iol69: healing is fun
[4:58:58] z3boss: healing is good
[4:59:00] jaxismynam3: shadow does S tier damage and B tier healing at the same time.... is cracked
[4:59:07] Wooshu: if everyone got buffed up to SPriest or Moonkin would be 0 to 100 PVP. Healers would be useless lol
[4:59:12] Jkorn415: disc is fun in stv
[4:59:16] Wooshu: or 100 to 0
[4:59:59] woodstop22: league of legends is driving me crazy, i need to stop playing it
[5:00:01] Pudgypantss: First they came for the hunters, and I did not speak out—because I was not a hunter. Then they came for the boomkins, and I did not speak out—because I was not a boomkin. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
[5:00:03] veiloflonelystars: ye that will likely only by the thing at 60
[5:00:05] z3boss: theres no decay
[5:00:12] based_takes: pvp sets when

[5:00:43] woodstop22: what champion should I play this game in league
[5:00:44] veiloflonelystars: possible also new pvp events
[5:00:51] Iol69: rated bgs would be fun
[5:00:58] veiloflonelystars: rated bgs make all sense in classic
[5:00:59] OlympicUSA: Illenium lets go!
[5:01:18] Wooshu: Maybe they need to bring the PVP stat to armor so you would have to grind out armor seperate to PVE in order to be good in PVP
[5:01:36] veiloflonelystars: they could make some balancing for just instanced rated ppv

[5:48:53] Evirity: Sonii are you shadow spec right now?
[5:49:23] iheartmywife: its wild growth
[5:49:24] Evirity: so I leveled through SM healing 90% through PoM and vamp embrace, because vamp embrace will move PoM off of 100% hp targets
[5:49:28] iheartmywife: and healing touch for tanks
[5:49:28] Jon_GamesTV: rank4 HT and WG
[5:49:29] Bromorin: it's wild growth and... wild growth
[5:49:37] Evirity: so just rank 1 SWP on a mob to get vamp embrace proccing and keep PoM moving for ez heals
[5:49:54] iheartmywife: i play rdruid for my guild. it's literally ResidentSleeper  first 4 bosses and then monkaS on the last 2
[5:50:15] iheartmywife: logs marked me as boomy on first 4 cause I pressed maybe 1 wg on each fight lmao
[5:50:56] Evirity: from my experience you normally can use r1 renew to get PoM off a target with like 99% hp right
[5:51:03] Evirity: but it wont move it off a target with 100%
[5:51:08] Evirity: vamp embrace will, so stacks are constantly moving
[5:51:25] iheartmywife: you think they will rework raids or tier sets at 60?
[5:51:54] Ranzorx: try female undead model its nice for priest

[5:57:57] handy_grenade: esfand
[5:58:01] iheartmywife: they've also always been variety streamers. not wow alone.
[5:58:04] 113nik: whats the snack?

[5:58:09] Buddylee007: You see the lumber and honor are purchasable now from STV event?

[5:59:08] ogMansoN: feeling pumped up right now on my 4th beer, might do some pushups
[5:59:08] NotBravoTV: I think your good on wow content for a while. Then you have the Riot MMO right after
[5:59:14] iheartmywife: Also in Sodas case its not his fault this time around. Onlyfangs was peak content and I feel like he'd MUCH RATHER have the time to do that rn
[5:59:15] st0neh: Reported for healing in shadowform
[5:59:28] Brusien: yeah
[5:59:35] limburgse: yeah :(

[5:59:59] ogMansoN: you should do your irl fitness for sure, and you'll be helping so many people
[5:59:59] exequtegg: Soda got banned for buying gold and hardcore died pretty much is what happened though @SONII
[6:00:02] Juiceboxqt: there was a ton of wow content that dropped back to back so prob burnt out viewers
[6:00:04] voteforpedro064: Bahjeera did that i think its going well. He does weightlifting streams
[6:00:12] creaturesfan72: @exequtegg didnt get banned
[6:00:15] st0neh: Onlyfans when? Kappa
[6:00:16] iheartmywife: @exequtegg thats not why he stopped onlyfangs

[6:00:38] choochiiee: idk when u were tanking in classic 2019 u were playing a lot
[6:00:39] creaturesfan72: @exequtegg his gf's dad died so he stopped playing HC
[6:00:42] mdiskul: your doing much better
[6:00:46] JayBravoTV: @SONII are you gonna try Last Epoch?
[6:01:09] iheartmywife: @choochiiee 2019 sonii was nuts. those leveling and early p1 streams were pog
[6:01:18] nowheretoday: You'd be back by p3?
[6:01:20] iheartmywife: chaotic asf too
[6:01:33] Juiceboxqt: how long is P2 forecasted ?
[6:01:49] choochiiee: ya i would say mostly leveling and MC.
[6:02:06] iheartmywife: Classic wow beta was at its peak the 2 weeks before my wedding. Man that was such a great month lol june 2019
[6:02:10] Wrecktified: Ironforge gym appearance, when?
[6:02:12] limburgse: i think p4 will bring back everyone together
[6:02:21] jirkasaurus: new here what did you do in Japan?
[6:02:32] veiloflonelystars: i bet lots of people are waiting for p3 or p4 at 60 cause they can't do the lvling phases but im enjoying them
[6:02:42] BIEM491: @sonii its sad alot of people quit after p1
[6:02:43] gaychris: sod gamer
[6:02:50] ogMansoN: yo come p4 40 man raids dude. gotta squad up
[6:02:50] Nightbot: yo
[6:02:59] veiloflonelystars: exacly
[6:03:06] choochiiee: i enjoy the leveling phases. i grinded 5 classes to 60 in classic and i was sick of it. this makes bringing my 3 characters to 60 waaayyy easier
[6:03:10] NotBravoTV: Ya i agree P4 is when things will pick up.
[6:03:16] veiloflonelystars: also this is better for new players
[6:03:18] rippedwaffle44: I love the lower lvl caps, content to the max and it's like twinking and checking the game out.
[6:03:30] BIEM491: Streamers quit I think @sonii
[6:03:31] nowheretoday: Yeah some of my guildies don't show up anymore
[6:03:35] NotBravoTV: I think its to slow for everyone's ADHD brains now
[6:03:37] ogMansoN: actually i gotta get in the discord and find a raid group for faster clears
[6:03:52] rippedwaffle44: I myself miss BC so much as well as tons of others. Do you think they will ever do a HC or regular BC Classic Era server? It's all over the forums we're dying to play again. @SONII
[6:04:01] sparKoz: SOD is the most fun ive had in wow since classic
[6:04:02] rippedwaffle44: Esfand also said he would play TBC so hard.
[6:04:02] insuperable43: o dam sonydigital the warcraftmovies legend
[6:04:25] Tyfonius: my realm has dropped in population a lot
[6:04:28] veiloflonelystars: @moonzgaming12 esfand only cares about seal twisting gameplay KEKW
[6:04:33] gaychris: i really enjoyed tbc
[6:04:35] MeatyGorak: i never got to play tbc classic

[6:48:46] Mokanshu: boss claps but you get more bloods fighting in the area around him and he claps people so you get free kills
[6:48:55] OGSceneBoy: Damn hahaha
[6:48:56] sneaky937: monkaW
[6:49:01] sneaky937: ITS LOA TIME
[6:49:18] Selecktt: Good news is you ate a SW Death and it only took 15% of your hp
[6:49:42] vepsee: @epicusernamebro they would have to change how you acquired loot entirely, or open world pvp would be dead since no one would want to risk their gear
[6:49:48] limburgse: NOPE
[6:50:01] sneaky937: nope not fun at all for casuals or solo players
[6:50:04] sneaky937: classic blizzard
[6:50:15] OGSceneBoy: Doing this event solo is fckn horrible
[6:50:18] vepsee: then enjoy your dead game mode lol
[6:50:24] vepsee: if they ever added that
[6:50:36] sneaky937: @epicusernamebro you clearly haven't played games that have loot drop on death. they all die instantly for an obvious reason
[6:50:44] vepsee: exactly what I mean
[6:50:44] KKonaStevieG: Everyone would run around in garbage gear KEKW
[6:50:48] g_1_t: ya i dont liek that idea at all
[6:50:51] seanxdon1: drop gold
[6:51:05] vepsee: lol
[6:51:45] OGSceneBoy: Ultima online enjoyers GIGACHAD
[6:51:48] vepsee: thats what ascension did and open world died
[6:51:52] Selecktt: Drop your gear, with the optional Gear InsuranceTM from the shop. $4.99 per slot, consumed on use. New feature to war within.
[6:51:53] notdxsty: play tarkov if you're looking for that
[6:51:57] itbeHootie: that would incentivize gold buying even more lol
[6:52:04] fanniclap: Diablo 2 if you died to many times I remember your body "popping" but dropping whatever gold in your inventory was a thing.
[6:52:08] veiloflonelystars: ultimate online and asherons call
[6:52:10] fanniclap: Was that said? I just got back lol
[6:52:37] illskill: d2 best game of all time
[6:52:39] SeeMoreThings: Diablo 4 OMEGALUL
[6:52:40] veiloflonelystars: i get your vision but that would kill world pvp
[6:52:42] fanniclap: Diablo 2 was the fucking best man I loved that shit
[6:52:45] itbeHootie: d4 bad
[6:52:46] testiklees3: d2 is the best game i agree
[6:52:46] vepsee: yea what happened to d4 open world pvp lol
[6:52:49] vepsee: never hear about it
[6:52:59] OGSceneBoy: D2 is more innovating then D4 lol
[6:53:01] mafiasheep: turns out sliced bread is meh
[6:53:10] g_1_t: @epicusernamebro the runescape wilderness mentality, it was fun but gear was to standerdized
[6:53:13] PurpleRusTt: d2 you dropped all your items if your inventory was full. people scammed newbs like that.
[6:53:18] nowheretoday: Lmao

[6:55:28] vepsee: do u have ur epic crafted items yet
[6:55:30] OGSceneBoy: It is, alot of people already have over 1g
[6:55:35] OGSceneBoy: Blood coin gold
[6:55:42] ogMansoN: i think the last thing they said was thats a long time
[6:55:43] sneaky937: #1 war parse is using that ugly mace rn :p
[6:55:45] vepsee: price is gonna go up
[6:55:48] 0dicul: does tauren have more hit for mace
[6:55:49] creaturesfan72: yeah its insanely expensive
[6:55:50] vepsee: they shadow nerfed the farm
[6:55:58] vepsee: for the salvages
[6:56:02] sneaky937: fairly sure he's arms
[6:56:09] vepsee: just the mats
[6:56:12] momofallsandbdo: u get your mount yet
[6:56:13] lebvaa: arms no mortal strike
[6:56:14] notdxsty: price for the items are gonna go down when it's 3 day lockout
[6:56:25] notdxsty: why would it ever go up when we can get in more lockouts??
[6:56:25] lebvaa: 5 crit from fury
[6:56:33] brgross: my guy
[6:56:46] g_1_t: its going to go up for the next week or so until the instance gets put on the 3 day lockout instead of the 7 then it will go back down
[6:56:49] vepsee: @notdxsty cause people were farming trash mobs for the salvages, you cant anymore
[6:56:55] vepsee: so you can only get 12 now per lockout
[6:56:58] vepsee: from bosses
[6:57:00] zalmighty98: no war buffs sadge
[6:57:15] iheartmywife: the way you craft the epic item is with mats from different profs and you get those said mats from boxes from turning in salvage that drops in the raid
[6:57:31] Morrifdx1: would you use the 2h mace for pvp?
[6:57:33] notdxsty: 3x from the dark iron rare
[6:57:34] killanyoux: lmao
[6:57:39] notdxsty: and im psure they still drop from trash
