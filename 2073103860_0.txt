[8:22:32] Gozs: @Thedruidtyler Isn't Google like the first sponsor of Android themselves? Like, you telling me to use their service and be socked at ads
[8:22:50] snejpen: the same people who are android users complaining about iphone users are the classic andys who cant hear the name retail without typing something xdd
[8:22:52] Thedruidtyler: @Gozs i can use browsers like brave on android that blocks ads
[8:23:01] 5L4Y3R: Firefox mobile no ada

[8:23:59] TBAGodzilla: becausse no one play it
[8:24:00] Scaleless1776: retail is much harder than classic
[8:24:01] kharma99: Retail is A LOT faster where a lot more things happen at once. Classic is slower paced, but in order to "parse" you need a lot more GAME KNOWLEDGE
[8:24:07] POPCOIN: the ppl who do that are dogshit too ICANT
[8:24:11] GoodGuyEli74: retail has harder content but 90% of the player base who even talk shit dont engage with that content
[8:24:14] shinezlightz: wow in general isnt hard at all thats the biggest wow player cope
[8:24:15] TBAGodzilla: less popular = easier to be better then overall player

[8:25:02] Indomitablez: @Graycen Are world buffs required for your raids?
[8:25:03] Falconic22: Buttsoap live buttLeave
[8:25:06] GoodGuyEli74: not gonna lie ive played with a lot of 3k io players who should quit and go play classic
[8:25:06] ehweron: Average retail player doesnt raid or pvp tho. they do daily quests and collect mounts/pets
[8:25:10] Nightbot: My second channel is twitch.tv/definitelygraycen
[8:25:23] shinezlightz: that is ture
[8:25:27] Thedruidtyler: @Gozs theres a lot of things you can't do on iphones because apple wont allow it on the store i dont really care to have this argument though feelfree to google "why you shouldn't get a iphone 2024"
[8:25:30] sinisterhorizons: I did all yesterday
[8:25:31] Waaysus: has 3k RIO
[8:25:32] ehweron: average retail player are young women and old boomer guys
[8:25:35] Denohar: thats true in my experience. retail is big on collecting
[8:25:36] DuckSmoke_: The average retail player is a myth, they don't exist.
[8:25:39] GoodGuyEli74: average retail player buys wow tokens and pays others to carry them though content
[8:25:40] shinezlightz: average retail player does not clear the normal raid difficulty
[8:25:41] 5L4Y3R: @ehweron true
[8:25:41] sinisterhorizons: M+ is super AIDS

[8:25:56] damroyalty: people really hate on retail lmao
[8:26:02] Indomitablez: @Thedruidtyler Android is for the geeks/people who like to customize stuff. iPhone is for people who want a phone that is easy to use and just works
[8:26:08] Elshadows22: Huntards EleGiggle
[8:26:16] snejpen: M+ is the best feature they have ever added, you finally have a reason to actually be geared and know how the game works
[8:26:17] kb_h: mark my words they are doing some kind of crossover at the end of SoD phases
[8:26:20] sinisterhorizons: No way, I hate M+ despite doing my 20s this season for 2500
[8:26:21] rainlel: starting zones are full of hunter bots
[8:26:21] Scaleless1776: mythic plus sucks dick

[8:26:25] POPCOIN: m+ is great for a few weeks each season
[8:26:29] Thedruidtyler: @Indomitablez no iphone is for boomers but you dont need to customize much on android
[8:26:29] GTokie: ask him what he had for breakfast, if he says rice hes a bot

[9:49:50] dutch_1908: PEPW i want it all
[9:50:06] its_giroux: I think it‚Äôs fair as raid leader to make your own rules if ppl join they should respect it but I think it‚Äôs fine to reserve 1 piece as leader
[9:50:14] AlphaSimply: 2.0
[9:50:17] OwOoo: you expect "graycen loot reserver" to share loot with mccool, come on guys it was never going to happen Sadge
[9:50:19] relmo: is graycen getting stronger mentally? Normally he would have caved by now and said fuck it while crying
[9:50:26] AlphaSimply: + talents?
[9:50:48] its_giroux: not several or you won‚Äôt get ppl to come really because of the loot hogging because when you get all your gear so fast you stop playing LUL
[9:50:48] DuckSmoke_: @relmo I gave him a nice pep talk earlier.
[9:50:51] applefrit: Graycen just make the raid a GDKP to make it fair for all
[9:50:51] Aidandgaf: ihategraycen
[9:51:03] brjnoqo3kd: these raiders really have nothing else productive to do to join a raid with no gear possibilities KEKW

[9:51:54] DuckSmoke_: @relmo I just let him know Mcconn could only hurt him IRL and not in game.
[9:52:03] its_giroux: so you‚Äôre reserving one piece you want but rolling on others as well or nah?
[9:52:15] Cosmic_Waves: I just feel so bad for McConnell
[9:52:16] relmo: it's one thing to not let him roll on gear but he didn't even entertain the thought of it
[9:52:33] dutch_1908: lootmaster
