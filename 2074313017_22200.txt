[6:38:14] Roy__: What if the green one is enraged
[6:38:47] Roy__: No but do you get the exposed buff or not
[6:39:06] NoiseyToy: Probably could quickfix by making an invisible wall high enough to not jump over to force players into the area if that's super important.

[7:18:43] dolordolo: 5Head
[7:18:56] Grimjacke: shadowportal too!!!!!
[7:19:00] NoiseyToy: Normal size. People with big foreheads usually grow out their bangs.
[7:19:00] Grimjacke: itneeds it WAY more
[7:19:05] ticdup: sand swell should literally cover the entire screen
[7:19:06] Roy__: You mean the entrance to the portal?
[7:19:34] Grimjacke: shadow portal too!!!!!!!
[7:19:35] Hundred123: make the entrance bigger and the exit completely invisible NODDERS

[7:21:05] Luaren: @NarcinRoc HUH
[7:21:10] Nike_DnT: zero healers is the correct number
[7:21:22] NoiseyToy: Healer check :O
[7:21:27] orophia: 5 healers is the correct number
[7:21:37] ticdup: I think this is gonna be the first fight where you need more than 2 healers. Lingering Light mandatory.
[7:21:39] ghilbor: Heal check gaming
[7:21:42] Nani_GW: roy confirmed the boss turns into a tree at the last 10%
[7:21:42] Roy__: You would prefer having 1 healer?
[7:21:44] Snebzor: 10 healers or lose
[7:21:50] Roy__: Or you just mean because it would make it harder with only 1
[7:22:17] Roy__: Isn't requiring more healers kind of making it more difficult as well since you'll have less spots for dps?
[7:22:33] Roy__: Assuming there's a dps check I guess
[7:22:34] Nani_GW: @roy__ he means the dps check is so hard you only have space for 1 healer
[7:22:39] Roy__: Right right

[7:22:50] aFlyingGuru: 9 hours of prep for a boss that dies 9 minutes after patch release pepewW
[7:22:52] NoiseyToy: There could be a DR applied to healing. Like a max amount of healing generated per second, that's assuming there's no real hard enrage.
[7:22:58] Magrest___: pepewW
[7:23:00] dolordolo: @Nani_GW if that was the case, holy carnage for frogmen xddTree

[7:27:30] Byrchi: You place wildfires and soak orbs
[7:27:32] Byrchi: HOLY
[7:27:44] Lethorio: i genuinely think the CM mechanic will just be that you can only kill one of his illusions on the split phase, so you have to deal with one extra empowered ability
[7:27:49] orophia: orbie worbies owoFish
[7:27:51] Grimjacke: is that even a cc
[7:28:06] Nani_GW: the circles will be replaced by oil
