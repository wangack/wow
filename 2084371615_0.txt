[1:17:28] crusadein: blizzard has long gone from for the players to the shareholders.
[1:18:06] Shaengus: does it make less money? either people will stop paying subs because their account is banned from cheating or people will stop paying subs because they think blizz is fine with cheaters
[1:18:28] Shaengus: at least in the second scenario they dont look like shit lol
[1:18:32] crusadein: @Shaengus bot farms man, those people have like 10 accounst per monitor and they have hundreds
[1:19:12] crusadein: Chinese gold farmesr loved it over having to work the mines
[1:19:16] Shaengus: true i guess. but if it kills a whole scene (dead mode though etc), surely its not like 1:1 comparable

[1:19:58] smoothkeyz4: i got mine in lfr 3 weeks ago lol
[1:20:45] Shaengus: causation or correlation - do you think people were actually playing because there were gold farmers lol - or do you reckon there were shitloads of gold farmers because the game was popular, hence it was worth doing

[6:34:00] atoker: the problem is outlaw suits the kultiran sailor theme a lot more and the knock and hook give me cliff superiority in rbgs

[7:17:59] xen0phics: id quit the game if it had no addons
[7:18:01] xen0phics: cuz it sucks
[7:18:02] shameshady: Asmon is a content creator and buisness man.. the stuff he is saying is not honest opinions or serious attempts on making WoW better.. he farms views, reacts and clicks.. and he is very good at it

[7:25:15] al_capow: I think the fights aren't log enough to need it, but I love using it between trash pulls
[7:25:24] al_capow: or just swapping into it for the passive regen
[7:26:19] al_capow: bfa cloak too

[7:27:24] xen0phics: lmao someone in asmons chat said Prydaz
[7:27:26] xDaruis: in bfa the cloak was fine but until the vendor random rng on corruptions LUL
[7:27:31] xen0phics: and hes absolutely correct xD
[7:27:56] crusadein: there was an add for that game where the guys are jumping into the stone ting and a giant girl is squishing it closed with her thighs
[7:28:04] xen0phics: legion rng was terrible
[7:28:14] atoker: shadow lands and legion had the best lego system
[7:28:30] xen0phics: legion only in last patch
[7:28:38] xen0phics: also titanforged gear was terrible
[7:30:48] al_capow: I like achieve based legendaries, like imagine a classic legendary bow with an on-use special trap, and the way to get it is to kill every single type of beast in the game
[7:31:08] xen0phics: his arguement of not nerfing bosses is ridiculous
[7:31:15] indithedog: Is he assuming perfect tuning?

[7:31:27] hunchurio: i'm down for zero addons tho
[7:31:27] xen0phics: physically impossible
[7:31:40] hunchurio: it would suck but if everyone was on an even playing field
[7:31:52] hunchurio: would also allow new players to not feel overwhelmed
[7:31:58] xen0phics: race for world first would last for 6 months if they didnt have weakaura for every step they make
[7:33:56] crusadein: @xen0phics but would blizzard have to make the raid so difficult if wa didnt exist?
[7:34:16] al_capow: imo they should introduce a framework like WA into the game directly and wrap a tutorial around it
[7:34:39] xen0phics: they wouldnt have to, but mythic raiding came so far already idk how would it revert back to mop

[7:35:00] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[7:35:39] xen0phics: so basically wa's are combat log but easier to read. damn i never thought of that
[7:35:46] bigfathead: isn't asmon kind of saying just casualise the game?
[7:36:01] bigfathead: wouldnt getting rid of mythic and heroic be the same thing?
[7:36:22] nz_jade: @bigfathead Yeah he wants it to be like classic, no skill involved. just need to be a degen who puts in the time and you get all the rewards

[7:36:31] xen0phics: asmon didnt think this through i think
[7:36:40] xen0phics: @nz_jade solid take
[7:37:28] al_capow: I think it would help to find ways of introducing extremely competitive gamemodes into less group play
[7:37:46] al_capow: like put a mage tower in SoD and attach a rank and gear reward to it
[7:37:58] bigfathead: his legendary take makes no sense either
[7:38:02] nz_jade: there really needs to be competitive bgs
[7:38:35] bigfathead: it more sounded like he wanted rare end game boss drops so they would be less build defining?
[7:38:54] xen0phics: just completely remove pve from the game and make the game humans vs orcs pvp like it was in 1999. haha
[7:39:18] al_capow: FootmenFrenzy2024 lol
[7:39:36] avenueone: delete solo shuffle from the game and make it a mobile game
[7:40:01] al_capow: I'd play sod mobil tbh
[7:40:14] nz_jade: as a whole things are pretty good in DF. Its essentially Wow3, they've listened and made some good changes and created some evergreen systems, so hopefully the next few expacs just build on it . A lot of the classic andys just like to shit on retail for views
[7:40:43] xen0phics: i agree

[8:01:31] al_capow: My guild recently had an issue where the tank was tanking wrong so we were threat capped and it messed up parses pretty bad lol, and then it influences who gets what gear if you try to go by parse or tank or whatever
[8:03:17] shugguls: yer i did
[8:03:50] avenueone: i wiped toc from my memory
[8:03:50] al_capow: it turns raids into gauntlets
[8:03:51] shugguls: u just zone in and everything becomes a arena boss fight
[8:04:33] al_capow: I think gauntlets work in solo play tho, I wish we had more experiences like that
[8:04:46] al_capow: a way to get gear progression solo but together
[8:05:00] bigfathead: i think many people dont want to raid because they can't make the time commitment
[8:05:11] al_capow: let GW2 had a gauntlet where there were open world bosses you could challenge, and other people could watch and fight different bosses next to you
[8:05:15] al_capow: like*
