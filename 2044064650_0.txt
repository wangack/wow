[0:12:41] Do0dy93: i the beginning, there was nothing but a voice
[0:12:42] lyreilla: LoL me neither. I am of no help haha

[0:14:38] Harai_Ulfsark: is this new pc?
[0:14:45] stregnor: camera is wiggling as you move around now.
[0:14:55] stregnor: seemed more stable before
[0:15:21] Artanaxas: you sound perfect, maybe the music is a bit louder?
[0:15:23] SlithTheSivak: just for controversy u should check out the ai art thread on mmochamp
[0:15:24] stregnor: aaaah!!! white balance adjust!  :)
[0:15:38] s7wede: yeah it seems to be oversaturating you slightly lol
[0:15:42] eroc84: well we now know hes not a dracthier vampire lol
[0:16:07] stregnor: yeah, music feels a bit higher than voice today.
[0:16:27] ChrisStoll: Mic sounds fine to me
[0:16:33] vuhdubones: better
[0:16:34] stregnor: sounds normal now
[0:16:38] eroc84: mic is louder than music now
[0:16:39] s7wede: All sounds good
[0:16:51] 324bee21: I thought your name was MrGM
[0:17:00] RehRehh: my ears WutFace
[0:17:00] stregnor: with the mic boost, there's a better timbre to your voice too
[0:17:18] eroc84: oh my
[0:18:02] s7wede: you don't have an external HDD that you can just move the retail folder onto your new PC directly from your old one?
[0:18:50] Akaveary: HDD are relics
[0:19:20] SlithTheSivak: lots of ai generated images storage!
[0:19:34] RehRehh: are you gonna play palworld

[0:20:15] faendryla: hii
[0:20:17] Azukh: Yo dude, jealous of ur new pc haha
[0:20:21] dgriesemer: Hey
[0:20:27] MizzyMK: here !
[0:20:31] SlithTheSivak: @MrGM u dont have ur browser extensions installed
[0:20:33] Tauren0309: Hallo Friday Again
[0:20:37] NateOliveiras: Good morning
[0:20:58] SlithTheSivak: dracJAM
[0:21:09] MizzyMK: I hope you get a lot of FPS
[0:21:46] s7wede: it's probably got Vsync enabled that is why
[0:21:56] AlfredK: It defaulted to 5 with the new PC? Pretty sure it did that for my high-end PC too
[0:21:57] ChrisStoll: Valdraken just destroys my 3070ti
[0:22:35] physalis4: this is the true test
[0:22:40] SlithTheSivak: fly around
[0:22:45] physalis4: like butter!
[0:22:45] Laevykinz: Based.
[0:22:51] Akela3: so many frames
[0:22:55] Tauren0309: The Starforge symbol is looking good...
[0:23:06] physalis4: "I can't believe it's not valdrakken"
[0:23:08] AlfredK: Yea the benchmarks
[0:23:24] Harai_Ulfsark: i miss the can you run crysis memes
[0:23:30] SlithTheSivak: vsync off!
[0:23:45] Akaveary: Runs better than my 3060
[0:23:50] Harai_Ulfsark: disable latency thing, you dont need it and it will run better
[0:24:03] s7wede: if you haven't changed the keybind, you can press CTRL+R to show the FPS
[0:24:14] keyboardturner: do you have a monitor that supports said frames tho? :p
[0:24:16] Caedo_eu: !drops
[0:24:16] StreamElements: World of Warcraft currently has TWITCH DROPS! Watch FOUR HOURS of any WoW Stream from 6pm GMT January 23rd - January 30th to obtain the Grim Campfire Toy in-game. REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH https://account.battle.net/connections
[0:24:37] SinicalDev: the eyes only see 30fps 4Head
[0:24:38] SlithTheSivak: if u only have a 40htz monitor it doesnt matter
[0:24:39] keyboardturner: depends on the monitor, so no idea
[0:24:41] s7wede: go to your Nvidia display settings
[0:24:46] Caedo_eu: Congrats on the Starforge sponsorship!
[0:24:48] keyboardturner: peepoGiggles
[0:25:03] keyboardturner: "look at all these frames" meanwhile it's still just 60fps
[0:25:08] AlfredK: Is it not there in the drop down?
[0:25:18] Caedo_eu: DO IT
[0:25:18] Akela3: should be fine
[0:25:23] Tauren0309: Do it
[0:25:25] AlfredK: Yeaa it will be fine
[0:25:26] keyboardturner: capture software will be limited anyway i think
[0:25:27] Larkaro: it wont
[0:25:28] Harai_Ulfsark: its a gamble
[0:25:29] Akela3: ez
[0:25:32] Shrandamar: it should only affect output to monitor
[0:25:33] Harai_Ulfsark: we here
[0:25:34] stregnor: still here
[0:25:40] keyboardturner: i don't believe twitch can go above 60
[0:25:42] SultanGaming44: hello
[0:25:43] eroc84: you only live once do it
[0:25:44] SultanGaming44: F
[0:25:46] stregnor: lots more frames too
[0:25:47] physalis4: Did loading into SW go faster?
[0:25:59] Harai_Ulfsark: also remember to limit the framerate to something humanely possible so non-optimized games dont fry your new pc
[0:26:09] physalis4: SSDs are great for loading the games faster
[0:26:26] Akaveary: What CPU do you run?
[0:26:32] ChrisStoll: Probably can set a frame rate limit so it's not always just 100%ing the video card
[0:26:35] JakeSezz: New PC stream mrgmJAM mrgmJAM mrgmJAM
[0:27:06] Uchiha_Cloaky: Yo
[0:27:28] RAF_Sean: Look at this sexy image - Looking good Dan!
[0:27:28] keyboardturner: the "target FPS" option is actually really nice as well
[0:27:37] SlithTheSivak: welcome to the future mrgm
[0:27:48] RAF_Sean: You on max settings?
[0:27:51] FinkTV: good morning @MrGM
[0:27:55] JakeSezz: Eyyyyy! My guy thanks for that! mrgmDab saltyb27Cheers
[0:28:04] Akaveary: Damn
[0:28:14] SlithTheSivak: ever think about getting a G9 monitor?
[0:28:22] Harai_Ulfsark: queue to a follower dungeon let us see framerate on combat
[0:28:23] SlithTheSivak: raytracing is dope
[0:28:23] Akaveary: No lol
[0:28:25] RAF_Sean: Is the PC super bright? Your lighting looks different lol
[0:28:38] Harai_Ulfsark: or LFR LUL
[0:28:42] Akaveary: Wow really doesn‚Äôt utilize ray tracing
[0:28:48] SlithTheSivak: curved monitors are amazing for WoW!
[0:29:48] Demeternoth: he a trojan horse always was
[0:29:49] keyboardturner: i've always had mixed feelings about him tbh
[0:29:59] SlithTheSivak: where hes taking his golden parachute and traveling the world with his family?
[0:30:02] AlfredK: He tweeted the thing about him traveling the world
[0:30:05] Akaveary: Did he quit or was he let go to?
[0:30:07] JakeSezz: Yeah, it was LinkedIn
[0:30:20] AlfredK: I'm sure I saw a tweet
[0:30:21] SinicalDev: Some people have claimed he was made redundant, some have said he quit.
[0:30:27] Akaveary: Ahhh
[0:30:28] SlithTheSivak: this was all planned before he became president
[0:30:45] SinicalDev: It was a post on LinkedIn which has a totally different audience than Twitter.
[0:30:58] ChunkeyNinja: ChunkeyNinja subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! ALOO
[0:31:02] Shrandamar: My theory since last summer is that he was a plant by Microsoft to work the aqcuisition from the inside. So not surprised he's leaving
[0:31:04] AlfredK: Ah he tweeted as well but it wasn't the same thing
[0:31:15] Forgiven78: G'Morning, Dan.  Dis the new PC?
[0:31:18] JakeSezz: I could tell by the reactions in the screenie posted by Taliesin
[0:31:28] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:31:29] SlithTheSivak: @Shrandamar ur totally right
[0:31:34] Uchiha_Cloaky: peepoNotes
[0:31:35] Shrandamar: he worked under Phil before joining Blizz so
[0:31:39] SinicalDev: He wasn't planted as he was already working for Activision before he joined Blizzard lmao
[0:31:39] ChunkeyNinja: yep im good brother, talking layoffs I take it
[0:31:45] Uchiha_Cloaky: !followage

[0:32:07] BusterDonuts: @MrGM I had a suggestion for a silent keyboard. As an ethusiast and someone who games underneath my kids rooms in the basement I can assure you it works
[0:32:07] Typhurin: I don't get good vibes from him, think he knew the whole time and probably assisted with the layoffs..
[0:32:13] SlithTheSivak: it is right, he worked at microsoft for 20 years
[0:32:18] SinicalDev: You can click on your own name in chat to see how long you've been following
[0:32:19] physalis4: I was kinda surprised how many ppl were kissing his ass right away
[0:32:37] physalis4: No, his farewell tweet yesterday
[0:32:39] s7wede: Does that mean Holly is the new director of Wow?
[0:32:59] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[0:33:21] keyboardturner: aside from CS/GMs
[0:33:29] Akaveary: Don‚Äôt think so?
[0:33:32] keyboardturner: and *tangentially* the WoW team, Adam Holisky was
[0:33:32] physalis4: I think some lore ppl were let go
[0:33:35] s7wede: A whole bunch of CS was cut so they could outsource, but they aren't game specific
[0:33:37] vuhdubones: just customer service folk
[0:33:37] keyboardturner: server stuff
[0:33:42] Demeternoth: there were some layoffs in the lore team but that didn't specify WoW or other lore
[0:33:47] BusterDonuts: the brand is HHKB, Realforce line of keyboards. They have an R2, and all their models that are silent start with R2S-  they have a few different actuation forces; so if you like a lighter keypress they have a 35g which is what I have, but they have a 45 asnd a 55. The switch is TOPRE and it comparable to cherry mx browns. Tactile feel.
[0:33:49] SinicalDev: Quite a few of the battle net team were cut
[0:33:51] ChrisStoll: Yea @keyboardturner Adam :(
[0:33:54] keyboardturner: Lore historians went from a team to just 1 person
[0:33:59] BusterDonuts: my exact model I got R2S-US3-IV
[0:34:00] Mazerbeam: devs are usually untouched unless it's a shared service in a merger
[0:34:21] RehRehh: thank god I was tired of the soft modern writting
[0:34:22] ChrisStoll: @keyboardturner Did they really layoff that guy they made the whole lore gameshow about?
[0:34:24] shaypressplay: I read that some Art asset folks were let go, but not sure if it is solid truth
[0:34:41] S3N71: MrGM, let's give this new PC a real run for it's money, let's run BFD (and take my Hunter) so I can get the last two bosses down :D
[0:34:55] mikeygames: nice coloured hoodie
[0:34:57] keyboardturner: most of the artists were from Overwatch/Odyssey (untitled Survival game)
[0:35:04] keyboardturner: not sure on specifics to WoW
[0:35:12] viscka_games: I saw on blue sky that Christie Golden was laid off but no confirmation from her
[0:35:22] keyboardturner: tbh I've only seen ~100-150ish people so far out of the 1800
[0:35:32] S3N71: lol, it was blatant bed for boost, thanks for dismissing me so elegantly :)
[0:35:34] SultanGaming44: sword?
[0:35:37] BusterDonuts: How much do you think the team working on the next 3 expansions was gutted? I am scared that they laid the foundation to be a great 3 expansions and now im not so sure
[0:35:37] S3N71: *bef
[0:35:40] s7wede: What you could do is to turn your viewdistance all the way to 10. That should tax the new GPU
[0:35:42] S3N71: **beg
[0:36:13] keyboardturner: you're going to see a lot of people saying "x person was laid off" that they actually hate because they're frequently targets of WoW drama (ion/christy/danuser)
[0:36:13] thegreataspect: Was the ending of Dragonflight satisfying?
[0:36:20] Akaveary: What‚Äôs the new GPU?
[0:36:32] JakeSezz: My new PC has a 4060 (up from my 1660ti) and the first thing I did was crank up everything in WoW and BG3 lmao
[0:36:32] Demeternoth: me
[0:36:39] s7wede: They won't touch wow dev team, it's one of the only profitable ones in Blizzard ATM
[0:36:42] Demeternoth: Let em try
[0:36:46] SinicalDev: Not all the 1900 people were from Blizzard, quite a few CoD and eSports people got cut
[0:36:46] Demeternoth: what was the Q?
[0:36:58] Akaveary: Hottttt ü•µ
[0:37:07] S3N71: @s7wede I went from a 1080 to 3080 and did the exact same thing :D
[0:37:21] Akaveary: You don‚Äôt need to be satisfied when you got family
[0:37:41] Demeternoth:  poll is up!
[0:37:44] s7wede: Dragonflight hasn't technically ended. We have 2 patches to add more content in the run up to the next expansion prepatch
[0:38:12] JakeSezz: Oh is this the people with feelings about the title?
[0:38:20] physalis4: Who's mad about evergreen videos like that?
[0:38:26] JakeSezz: I saw those yesterday when watching the vid
[0:38:44] s7wede: I wouldn't pay attention to idiots in youtube comments
[0:38:51] Akaveary: Lmaooo
[0:38:55] Mazerbeam: I mean, it is clickbait.
[0:38:56] S3N71: wow :O
[0:38:58] keyboardturner: modCheck
[0:39:05] Shrandamar: lol
[0:39:07] Mazerbeam: They don't need to be rude about it
[0:39:09] Demeternoth:  vote quick!
[0:39:10] JakeSezz: Some people are more sensitive than a first-timer on prom night
[0:39:14] s7wede: It's not clickbait
[0:39:16] melph: These people are ridiculous
[0:39:18] Akaveary: It‚Äôs not
[0:39:33] MediumRareOG: It's not clickbait. You didn't say "new". You didn't imply it was ONLY from follower dungeons
[0:39:35] ChrisStoll: Looks like Lore Historian Lead, Sean Copeland, kept his job, but others didn't
[0:39:37] MediumRareOG: These people are autistic
[0:39:42] Akaveary: People are just dumb
[0:39:48] Demeternoth: Our survey says - NO
[0:39:54] SpaceCat80: it‚Äôs not Clickbait.
[0:39:55] shaypressplay: People amaze me at the things they get mad about, get mad about economy etc. Not a gaming video! My Lordy!
[0:39:56] phopheter: it was good to change video title to clarify
[0:40:07] Larkaro: I would have titled it like...how to get these mount using follower dungeons
[0:40:09] Mazerbeam: The original title implies they they are unique or added with follower dungeons. The new title is much better
[0:40:12] Demeternoth: Adn 5 people think you ROCK
[0:40:18] BusterDonuts: good luck on mount
[0:40:19] amy_star_a: Everything is clickbait in so much as you want to get attention and have people click it I guess, but it‚Äôs not misleading
[0:40:26] s7wede: @Mazerbeam It does not
[0:40:31] Mazerbeam: It does
[0:40:37] keyboardturner: literally how
[0:40:39] MediumRareOG: It does not imply that
[0:40:41] havoom01: some people just have brain damage,just dont mind them Dan
[0:40:44] s7wede: The old title doesn't say the word "new" at all
[0:40:50] danjoman: It does not at all
[0:40:51] Akela3: the original title was fine. people just go way too far out of their way to find fault in things
[0:40:57] suzyq1503: everything looks pretty. glad the new puter is working out üëçüèª
[0:41:06] thegreataspect: I can see that, but people just love to complain
[0:41:18] Akela3: it was pretty clear what you meant
[0:41:19] BusterDonuts: When i learned about the otter, I just dungeon qued on my rogue while I leveled till i got the two items,
[0:41:24] Tidesages: Are youn live from your new pc?
[0:41:27] RehRehh: ngl made me think that too
[0:41:29] SinicalDev: I can see how people could be confused either way, but the title wasn't egregious at all
[0:41:29] s7wede: It's idiots, being idiots.
[0:41:41] RehRehh: nobody perfect its all g
[0:41:42] JakeSezz: The only semantic argument could be that it lacked specificity but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the original title. People believe the way they understand something to be gospel truth and that‚Äôs not your fault
[0:41:45] Mazerbeam: You could have left out the word "follower" since follower dungeons play no part in the mounts. Once you added "easier" the title made more sense
[0:41:48] S3N71: I'll watch that video in a bit as I've yet to dabble in follower dungeons
[0:42:03] S3N71: And want the mounts ;-)
[0:42:04] swankytiger: Your intention wasn't click-bait, you can't help other people comprehend better
[0:42:13] RehRehh: @Mazerbeam yes
[0:42:21] mikeygames: What realm are you on again Dan?
[0:42:29] Mazerbeam: You can get the on your own before follower dungeons with match making :D
[0:42:29] Harai_Ulfsark: nah people are just dumb
[0:42:39] s7wede: I think it's a comprehension issue
[0:42:56] Collected1: i'm a big fan of follower dungeons. i hope they get extended to every dungeon.
[0:42:56] physalis4: I thought it was a good idea. Getting those motes for the O'hnara mount are a pain cuz you have to get a grp
[0:42:58] melph: People are stupid, it made perfect sense
[0:42:59] keyboardturner: and rely on RNG
[0:43:05] SlithTheSivak: ive hard ohnara since the first couple weeks of the xpac just running normals..
[0:43:07] Mazerbeam: RIGHT!
[0:43:09] phopheter: that's exactly why adding "easier" is better
[0:43:16] Mazerbeam: You just said a lot easier.
[0:43:17] Mazerbeam: LOL
[0:43:20] amy_star_a: I would always like to know how I can avoid people
[0:43:31] SultanGaming44: loot the box?
[0:43:33] keyboardturner: it was malice
[0:43:35] maplelost: was the 10.2.6 patch about the firings
[0:44:12] Mazerbeam: Clickbait doesn't imply lying
[0:44:25] MediumRareOG: I wouldn't give in to people like that. It's just going to encourage them
[0:44:26] BusterDonuts: @MrGM was going to ask can' you just skip to last boss?
[0:44:37] s7wede: @MrGM It's like saying that you prefer the color red and some idiot asking you why you hate blue. People will always find a way to complain
[0:44:38] Akaveary: Yes it does hahaha
[0:44:57] Collected1: my big idea: add wow content creator mains as available followers in The War Within, obtainable via Twitch drops
[0:45:18] Tidesages: Did you heard of the new MSI cheating monitor, it has a AI chip in it. for example in LoL it can read on the mini map where the enemy player is and will show on screen from where it comes to you!
[0:45:21] BusterDonuts: Do you have a speed set?
[0:45:33] Layliah79: Happy Friday!!!
[0:45:43] Akaveary: People made assumptions and then got mad when their assumptions did not come to fruition.
[0:46:05] S3N71: SoD Twitch drop when?  Mount would be nice :D
[0:46:24] phopheter: yeah i understand their point but imo the comments you received were a bit overdramatic
[0:46:27] Mazerbeam: People got bent out of shape because it's the internet. You could have had a more well thought out title, which you did fix, but people will always find a reason to be pissed.
[0:46:35] SultanGaming44: if you are fishing are you lying to catch a fish?
[0:46:41] SlithTheSivak: this'll sound silly, but the people never intended on feeling fooled. they just might think u were trying to be tricky when u werent
[0:47:25] mikeygames: you should add on 'and get the brutosaur' just to troll people, as by doing the dungeons they can get the 'gold' to eventually buy it off the bmah ha
[0:47:39] phopheter: KEKW
[0:47:46] physalis4: at a certain point you just have to laugh
[0:47:53] BusterDonuts: @MrGM Brush it off man, don't let them get to you.
[0:47:59] JakeSezz: The Internet in a nutshell: someone gets pissed at you for your banging their mom/dad but not their aunt/uncle jakese1LUL
[0:48:16] Ckraigfriend: did you assemble the new pc
[0:48:48] s7wede: it's like packing peanuts yeah
[0:48:53] Demeternoth: oh the foam??

[0:49:17] phopheter: transportation shit

[0:49:35] s7wede: you put the deflated plastic inside and then inflate it to get to every nook and cranny. It is much better than the old foam
[0:49:43] MediumRareOG: It's packing foam. It expands to fill space. They use it to avoid components being able to move in transit
[0:49:44] ChrisStoll: Yo nice. Just saw the starforge tweet. Grats on the partnership
[0:49:51] Demeternoth: yes camera hub

[0:58:23] 324bee21: Sports illustrated claimed a different top 3 matches, I don't buy it
[0:58:25] mikeygames: that 6 part podcast is absolutely brutal, mental
[0:58:26] JakeSezz: Yeah man that shit is BAD
[0:58:37] s7wede: So far it's just an accusation though
[0:58:52] Caedo_eu: Caedo_eu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! mrgmHehe
[0:59:45] 324bee21: him beating anyone other than Roman feels like a consolation prize though
[1:00:33] 324bee21: The Rock has to cost Roman the title somehow, like Solo comes out to save Roman and the Rock stops him from interfering
[1:01:02] mikeygames: have you checked the podcast behind the bastards? the vince mcmahon one? it's a 6 parter, absoulutely worth it
[1:01:18] BritishRaven: Could you imagine? Rocks music hits the crowd go wild and it's just the electrifying one just coming down to the ring pumped as all hell
[1:01:22] 324bee21: Our daughter is really into wrestling, we took her to Payback and the crowds at live wresting are bonkers
[1:01:56] bwoods79: It's crazy they just drop the survival game after 6 years of dev time. But I am sure they have a very good reason for doing it, probably better ideas in dev.
[1:02:07] Caedo_eu: Dragonflying in the old World looks so cool
[1:02:12] BritishRaven: Club tropicana drinks are freeeeeee
[1:03:02] sniffsc: Maybe they can turn it into something like with Titan -> Overwatch
[1:03:03] keyboardturner: I hope we get to see what was made for it even if unfinished but I expect NDAs are gonna last a long time
[1:03:13] SinicalDev: Imagine working on something for that long and it just being left on the digital scrapheap

[1:33:53] Jelky55: honestly i loved mechagon and nazjatar, so good
[1:33:55] S3N71: @fuchai The Twitch drop?  Other way round, Retail not Classic (unless it is on Classic?)
[1:33:58] funviking99: what class and race were you before the hunter?
[1:34:24] fuchai: check in the other timeline for that quest
[1:34:27] funviking99: oh damn

[1:34:43] Vesamora: you've probably answered this a dozen times already but how does the new PC feel?
[1:34:43] funviking99: cool
[1:35:17] MediumRareOG: I've never really understood why people do race changes. Is it just aesthetics?
[1:35:31] physalis4: Have you edited videos on the new pc yet to see how faster that is?
[1:35:38] MiddlePhaze: what specs? like gfx card
[1:35:40] Vesamora: the new PC feeling is unmatched. It's so nice not having like... ages of stuff on it. I am envious.
[1:35:55] MrEvilRex: did you install xtu and tune your CPU?
[1:35:56] fuchai: some race change for something new but others change for racial abilites
[1:36:14] databob1: Oh I forgot about your new pc...I'm glad everything is working out...who's the sponsor?
[1:36:25] Vesamora: yeah I should give that a go
[1:36:51] fuchai: at the high end of mythic plus for example, NE shadowmeld is just too good not to have
[1:37:01] Harai_Ulfsark: im the opposite, my worst nightmare probably includes loosing everything i have on my pc, turning it on and finding it empty would cause me the worse dread
[1:37:18] FrostBeered: going to give away a starforged gaming computer?
[1:37:29] MrEvilRex: they don't say no to the ad style or the build request?
[1:38:28] MediumRareOG: Youtube does tend to identify duplicated content, which can be an issue
[1:38:42] FrostBeered: that would be awesome
[1:39:12] MrEvilRex: so you staid in the talking points starforge said "we do not say no to a lot of things" I was asking if they mean PC build wise or the ad read wise @MrGM
[1:39:16] fuchai: makes you think the marketing team never watched what you made
[1:39:22] Ghostopheles: one step at a time
[1:39:31] MediumRareOG: Youtube doesn't know its an ad though so from their perspective it may seem like you'r ejust poisting the same content with slight differences. This is a signal of low quality
[1:39:47] swafe: @MrGM  What is the addon/WA that you are using for the dmg numbers (combat text)
[1:40:10] islepride: islepride subscribed with Prime. 
[1:40:45] MediumRareOG: Youtube does identify sections of a video as being duplicate. I don't know if this was the reason of course. Just theorizing

[1:55:01] MrEvilRex: all spirits are alcohol...
[1:55:02] MxViolet: no, lol it‚Äôs what is fermented that determines what kind of alcohol it is

[1:56:46] MxViolet: that‚Äôs like 16 locos lol
[1:56:51] MrEvilRex: bonjelaa might help with the spot, in case you were not aware of it
[1:56:51] Thoreya: i remember drinking 4lokos in high school when it had caffeine in it
[1:56:56] physalis4: I had a friend that we'd always lose if he drank 4 Loko. He'd wander off from the group
[1:57:00] Thoreya: nah
[1:57:03] Thoreya: they banned that shit
[1:57:04] Thoreya: lol
[1:57:13] MxViolet: no they had to remove it
[1:57:17] Thoreya: was like crack in a can
[1:57:18] doublenv: it was killing people lol
[1:57:22] MxViolet: cause kids would ya know‚Ä¶ go loko

[1:58:42] Thoreya: america its like 12% alcohol too
[1:58:56] Kurpto: I feel like they should sell it in a pack of 4. 4 little lokos.
[1:58:57] MxViolet: yah but a normal cocktail doesn‚Äôt usually give people heart failure
[1:59:14] SlithTheSivak: thats two products mixed

[2:00:06] Kurpto: Ever take 5-hour energy shots? lol
[2:00:20] MrEvilRex: it's caffeine + alcohol that is also a dangerous combo. Something to do with 1 slowing you heartbeat and the other speeding it up. @MrGM
[2:00:24] Hotstitute: why lol
[2:00:35] Hotstitute: might aswell drink 5x5hour energy shots
[2:00:52] Kurpto: @MrEvilRex combo of depressant and stimulant is never good

[2:02:05] Kurpto: autocorrect really fucked me with that one lol
[2:02:14] MrEvilRex: what genre of music is this?
[2:02:46] S3N71: Stay away from the top shelf.  Drink Stella, Newcastle Brown Ale or Guinness.
[2:03:00] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:03:16] Kurpto: dirty
[2:03:18] Kurpto: lol
[2:03:19] lindlyn: lol
[2:03:23] S3N71: It's the ale of Gods and Legends
[2:03:28] Kurpto: Brown ale sounds like guaranteed SHITS
[2:03:37] MrEvilRex: ale made from excrement, jk
[2:03:39] Vesamora: ah yes the broon
[2:03:56] Kurpto: I can feel a hangover looking at it
[2:03:59] wasserpestie: Pornstar Martini is also great! :D
[2:04:03] Nice_n_Dicey: a lot of ale is really good. Newcastle Brown not so much
[2:04:05] wasserpestie: P*rnstar Martini is also great! :D
[2:04:06] Nice_n_Dicey: I love ale :)
[2:04:14] databob1: I like German beer
[2:04:30] Vesamora: When I went to Newcastle, I had the misfortune of being introduced to Hooch
[2:04:38] Nice_n_Dicey: IPA
[2:04:44] Nice_n_Dicey: Indian Pale Ale
[2:04:46] DevoidX: thats Indian Pale Ale. Ale is different
[2:04:47] S3N71: There is Indian Pale Ale, so it's most likely based on fact
[2:04:53] MrEvilRex: hops were used for alcohol back in ancient egypt times
[2:05:09] S3N71: :O
[2:05:17] S3N71: I've had some nice IPAs
[2:05:28] databob1: ick  don't like IPAs
[2:05:33] wasserpestie: Do you know a "Speculoos Britain"?
[2:05:34] physalis4: Do you get the fruity and hazy IPAs over there?
[2:05:34] S3N71: Recommend the Brewdog range
[2:05:38] Nice_n_Dicey: craft ale is all about the flashy cans/labels
[2:05:41] Kurpto: "Early IPAs were only slightly higher in alcohol than other beers brewed then, but more of the wort was fermented, meaning few residual sugars, and they were heavily hopped.[16][17] While IPAs were formulated to survive long voyages by sea better than other styles of the time, porter was also successfully shipped to India and California."
[2:05:49] SirBarracuda: IPA far more hops, that yeah helped preservation, Brown ale generally heavier on the roasted malts than the hops
[2:06:03] physalis4: Citrus IPAs are very popular here in Southeastern US
[2:06:22] databob1: Dunkel is my favorite
[2:06:25] S3N71: @Kurpto Uncannily, love a Porter too as well - the Guinness one is epic
[2:06:32] Nice_n_Dicey: and here in the UK tbh
[2:06:41] physalis4: They're refreshing. Esp during our summers
[2:06:45] Kurpto: IPAs popped up all over NA and they are all run my hipster scum
[2:06:55] Kurpto: yep
[2:07:03] Kurpto: pseudo lumberjacks
[2:07:07] Hotstitute: ima call it, today isnt the 10.2.6 annoucnement, its the SoD announcement
[2:07:07] Nice_n_Dicey: yes
[2:07:13] lumaday: brewery guy is def a thing
[2:07:14] S3N71: I've two bottles of Newcastle in the fridge - I prefer it chilled
[2:07:19] MrEvilRex: you can show the website?
[2:07:23] Hotstitute: ye
[2:07:36] Hotstitute: i think it was delayed yesterday, but they got a schedule
[2:07:46] magemaster225: at this point they just drop the unencrypted ptr, no announcement, maybe patch notes
[2:07:55] S3N71: We know when SoD is though, 8th Feb, unless they announce some of the new runes
[2:07:59] amricatt: I think they would want to put out good news to show they are still working on customer's favorite games.
[2:08:15] Nice_n_Dicey: hazy jane is lovely :)
[2:08:17] databob1: I hope not ab announcement would be really in bad taste right now
[2:08:18] lumaday: look up burial brewery for the best can design
[2:08:21] Kurpto: All the marketing is so people can claim to be unique.
[2:08:24] ahux_: the taste is headache inducing - fuck knows what they put in that shit
[2:08:25] Big_Rum: Hello There!

[2:08:34] Big_Rum: Why you sitting in the dark?
[2:08:52] Kurpto: Why the fuck would anyone drink an alcohol free ipa
[2:08:53] Big_Rum: What flavour of cnadle do we have today?
[2:08:56] physalis4: Look up Tropicalia IPA from Creature Comforts. That's super popular here
[2:09:00] fuchai: oh yea
[2:09:00] Kurpto: It really is
[2:09:01] alexandrunst: the sun really is bright today, even up here in Scotland
[2:09:02] JakeSezz: Who tf wants to drink beer that tastes like skunked-out beer? mrgmO

[2:45:29] stregnor: LOL. much simpler while they can't walk yet
[2:45:56] Hellbound_Glory: My daughter is 21 months old. Trust me, it gets HARDER, but more rewarding.
[2:46:04] DarkThots420: Are you enjoying Dragonflight?
[2:46:09] NateOliveiras: Its the questline that you free her from the blade
[2:46:12] stregnor: that's for sure... but you'll see when you get there. much tougher to manage them when they're mobile
[2:46:17] DarkThots420: I have it but ive been just playing HC and Wrath

[2:49:58] ItsMeBiggz: wait are we the villans :D forcing the titans edicts on everyone :D
[2:50:00] jRizzler: Eh. It's one of those days, my friend.
[2:50:06] Zuldak: a lot of people dont want her to be a villain. It's going to be hard to convince the player base to oppose her.
[2:50:34] Ironhide_Gaming: someone say Megatron?
[2:50:55] jRizzler: I'm convinced the Old Gods are not completely out of the picture yet.
[2:50:57] Ironhide_Gaming: Ironhide died
[2:51:05] derzorn04: DIdnt she give us Gift of N'Zoth in the crucible of storms?
[2:51:07] ItsMeBiggz: would it be a bit crazy if all along the Titans were the actual villans and we'd backed the wrong horse all these years, will never happen but would be funny

[2:58:22] mymatedav: Codys line back to Punk on Monday was fantastic, I need Punk v Rhodes
[2:58:33] databob1: The little guys kinda looks like a punk
[2:58:44] RoboticUnicorn007: Undertaker v Mankind ..... Hell in a Cell
[2:58:52] mymatedav: YES! Shawn Michaels v Taker Promo, Daniel Bryan promo... so many good ones
[2:58:58] Hellbound_Glory: Wrestling seems complicated to get into.
[2:59:05] MachoCham: Cody Punk promo was perfect face vs face booking for me
[2:59:09] databob1: I haven't watch wrestling in forever

[2:59:48] LunarBlizzz: does the arborwyrm get a new ability like the pre-order mount?
[3:00:14] Big_Rum: war mode

[3:00:38] Layliah79: Did you watch the Netflix series about OVW?
[3:00:39] LunarBlizzz: your party member is north west of you

[3:01:17] wildwittra: oh. i miss Boralus so much. might need to level a toon through bfa
[3:01:34] S3N71: @wildwittra BfA was so good in my opinion
[3:01:36] jurassic28: farming island expeditions guzuBeliever
[3:01:51] LunarBlizzz: now that BFA has been gone for a little bit, do you feel it deserved the hate it got while it was current?
[3:02:01] Layliah79: HypeLurk meeting time
[3:02:10] jurassic28: wish there was an option to just have every enemy spawn on you at the start
[3:02:13] OrthiadNick: Yeah, leveling in BFA is smooth
[3:02:22] OrthiadNick: With two zones completed you are almost 60
[3:02:24] S3N71: @LunarBlizzz Never understood, loved the expansion
[3:03:13] LunarBlizzz: @S3N71 Same! That's why I got sad whenever people said it was bad while it was out
[3:03:40] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies üß° https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[3:03:48] Zuldak: BFA deserves all the hate and more for its game systems, particularly 8.0 and 8.1
[3:04:00] Aqrippa: Azerite farm and traits, nothing will make it good imo
[3:04:11] S3N71: I want this kissing and making up with Horde to stop, I just want to get back wholesale slaughter of them all
[3:04:19] Jarless: bfa will end up like mop not liked during then years later remembered with rose tinted glasses
[3:04:37] LunarBlizzz: I agree with tthe azerite armor being bad, but I personally liked the HoA, I thought it was cool
[3:04:55] Zuldak: The content was generally good, the story was... messy. We had the whole saurfang lines and then the war with the zandalar and then Azshara out of nowhere then Nzoth is randomly free
[3:04:58] Roflrobbie: Xally* lol
[3:05:32] MediumRareOG: I don't like "expansion items" like the HoA, legion legendaries, MoP cloak
[3:05:43] LunarBlizzz: N'Zoth was hinted at since pretty much the start of the expac though?
[3:06:08] athrem01: athrem01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 14 month streak! mrgmHelloThere
[3:06:18] MachoCham: I really didn't like the corrupted items tbh
[3:06:24] MediumRareOG: Even SL legendaries
[3:06:24] wildwittra: maybe too soon but i liked the base zones in SL, but SL had a lot of other issues with the maw , oribos and zones beyond the initial patch.
[3:06:43] MachoCham: I still uphold that everyone who liked it only liked it because of Twilight Dev stacking
[3:06:48] eziekiyah: I loved the corruption but on top of the other systems it was a lot
[3:06:56] Roflrobbie: How do we feel about the Earthen Allied race? Are all new races going to be choose faction? (looking at you Dracthyr and Eathern)
[3:07:05] MediumRareOG: The Maw in 9.0 was one of the worst zones they've ever done
[3:07:11] LunarBlizzz: Yeah I think if corruptions was a sole system on its own, it would be fun
[3:07:36] LunarBlizzz: cause I personally loved hitting a crap ton of haste on boomkin
[3:07:48] Roflrobbie: yeah like, are all new races going to choose a faction going forward?
[3:08:03] lyreilla: Did I hear an angry kitty lol?
[3:08:14] athrem01: Oh no
[3:08:20] LunarBlizzz: I hope we get more than earthen in War Within, having yet another Dwarf race seems kind of lazy. Not saying they look bad though
[3:08:52] Typhurin: the nzothussy
[3:08:55] wshs_: is she supposed to be a night elf?
[3:09:06] LunarBlizzz: what about raids? Do you think BFA raids hold their own against other expansions?
[3:09:14] MachoCham: I wouldn't mind long term that races become faction agnostic and then allied races just then become customisation options of the base races - A bit like Man'ari
[3:09:16] wildwittra: the zleeping city of nyalotha
[3:09:35] wshs_: im extremely biased on bfa - i think its the best expansion!
[3:09:46] wshs_: the most fun ive had so far.
[3:09:51] wshs_: subjectively :)
[3:10:37] MachoCham: Me am that type of orc :)
[3:11:00] LunarBlizzz: @wshs_ same here!
[3:11:10] LunarBlizzz: although season 3 and 4 of shadowlands raiding was pretty fun too
[3:11:43] wildwittra: what if "allied races" would be like more of reputation gain to "learn" special race-abilities and transmog. That way an orc could "learn" several "allied races" without creating new toons
[3:11:53] lyreilla: I have yet to play Shadowlands, no one has anything nice to say about it, lol.
[3:12:10] Lausten: Should be a 1 min CD with a toggle with no timer on it
[3:12:15] Roflrobbie: is that ALL dragon customizations? Or just ones you have unlocked?
[3:12:29] LunarBlizzz: do you think WoW would benefit from having a class/job system like FF? I'm sure you've been asked this before but I'm curious
[3:12:29] BBMezzy: I haven't even received my vial of endless draconic scales yet

[3:17:50] MachoCham: It's more the driving home the day after
[3:17:58] MachoCham: Buckfast is fucking horrific
[3:18:45] jurassic28: Buckfast is a 'tonic wine' made by monks in Devon,  its great if you dont want to remember your night and enjoy the sweet taste of piss
[3:18:53] nuclearphosphate: random question, does anyone know why i cant follow any more twitch channels? i just get the message "slow down try following more channels later"
[3:19:18] nuclearphosphate: my power button is on the top as well, however i DO turn mine off at night
[3:19:24] LisaJ__: Following too many?
[3:19:28] nuclearphosphate: yeah its weird, its been saying that over the past 3 days at least
[3:19:34] MageORageTV: it probably thinks you‚Äôre a bot
[3:19:45] OrthiadNick: Oh yeah, I know that struggle. Had that so many times during raids LUL
[3:20:01] nuclearphosphate: @L1sh00 nah only following 7 channels

[3:21:14] NeeK_23: heroic? think so

[3:26:08] jurassic28: I feel the 45 minute wait between events in DF just kills it, they should be either up all the time or a much shorter wait
[3:26:12] NeeK_23: I'm 3321 / 10500 on rank 2 and trying to do it as often as I can. its a hell of a grind

[3:27:24] BBMezzy: Sad times, Varya just tweeted
[3:27:25] Lausten: Yeah the event timers is what killed these events for me, oh you're 5 min too late, wait an hour, or you're early, sit arround stare at the screen for an hour NotLikeThis
[3:27:29] MachoCham: Check Discord DM :(
[3:28:20] MachoCham: Because sadly they can
[3:28:24] lyreilla: Who is this?
[3:28:40] lyreilla: Dawww ü•∫
[3:28:43] nuclearphosphate: damn this just keeps getting worse and worse
[3:29:01] MachoCham: She was fantastic at her job as well
[3:29:07] jurassic28: such a nice person, it sucks Sadge
[3:29:27] host_255: *soo
[3:29:37] Oswaldovzki: Feels like every merger/acquisition is followed by a stupid layoff
[3:29:41] bwoods79: I know it is highly unlikely, but have you ever thought what you would do if they all of a sudden pulled the plug on wow?
[3:29:51] nuclearphosphate: @Oswaldovzki ^ this
[3:29:57] Oswaldovzki: Because they can. They don't care. They only look at the numbers
[3:30:04] Lausten: Soo who do you contact now? Hmm
[3:30:21] jurassic28: outsourcing to cheaper companies abroad or implementing AI CS which is just gonna be ass
[3:30:28] nuclearphosphate: @bwoods79 given how much money, time and effort ive put into WoW over the years, i would.... be in a HELL of a depression for a LONG time thats for sure
[3:30:30] physalis4: Did the NA community manager get axed too?
[3:30:33] lyreilla: They have their own agenda and strategy probably and if they don't fit that, out they go üòû
[3:30:34] MachoCham: Outsource or expand Lugia's role
[3:30:50] SlithTheSivak: i can only imagine Microsoft has their own EU rep
[3:31:06] Oswaldovzki: @SlithTheSivak Makes sense

[3:31:41] MachoCham: Maybe merge to a global team?
[3:31:51] flgiirl: yes some were in NA
[3:32:00] NateOliveiras: the gaming industri was a bit doomed the day big corps discovered it was profitable
[3:32:05] NateOliveiras: industry*
[3:32:13] flgiirl: including my hubs :(
[3:32:49] magemaster225: all the customer service, being wrapped up into MSFTs CS group

[3:33:14] jrobdad: sorry if you've already talked about this, and it's obviously really bad for those impacted, what do you think this means for the game itself? does this delay future updates, or mean the product won't be as good as it can be?
[3:33:15] ImperfectDark: this is just corporation bull, like always. I used to work for PayPal and the US took over our ops, cut our team of 15 and decided our US counterparts could do the work. Then, a couple of years later they hired a load back
[3:33:25] SlithTheSivak: technically not their first MMORPG, they own ElderScrolls Online
[3:33:26] flgiirl: they let go many developers and those managing exceptions
[3:33:28] lyreilla: Microsoft's tech support is awful, that much I do know lol
[3:33:30] bwoods79: crazy: Overall, more than 21,000 workers have been let go of in 76 tech companies in January, according to tracking website
[3:33:37] jurassic28: didn't they brag about becoming a $3 TRILLION company on the same day as the layoff announcement... such scumbags
[3:34:04] flgiirl: yesterday was 1900 all let go in a group firing
[3:34:18] SlithTheSivak: whats the point of hoarding that much wealth
[3:34:33] SlithTheSivak: big companies are starting to look like mythical dragons
[3:34:57] Oswaldovzki: what pissed me of the most is that don't need to fire anyone :(   It wrecks peoples lifes :(
[3:34:58] Minobard: MicroSmaug
[3:35:07] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak World domination <evil laughter>
[3:35:24] roman_dxd: addon name for that quest addon, please?
[3:35:28] jurassic28: as long as Bobby got his departure package and the shareholders are happy, they don't care
[3:35:37] nuclearphosphate: question @MrGM if i was to get Zygor dragonflight, is that JUST dragonflight, or does it have all expansions?
[3:35:41] BBMezzy: Microsoft is really starting poorly with this tone they're setting
[3:35:44] nuclearphosphate: im just researching the addon
[3:35:45] NeeK_23: its rarely one person affects, its partners and kids and dependants too
[3:35:46] flgiirl: my son's father passed away in October, and now step dad unemployed.. he's getting ready to go to college in fall.. now we are fd
[3:35:53] bwoods79: For me I hate politicians. They pass bills that affect millions of people's jobs
[3:36:33] Minobard: these creatures look neat
[3:36:38] Ishkor: !drops

[3:36:57] NeeK_23: I think maybe working a notice period
[3:37:05] MachoCham: Hmm I think you're right
[3:37:08] athrem01: Yeah better working laws in EU
[3:37:09] SlithTheSivak: ya you cant get same day fired in the EU, must be nice to have job protections.
[3:37:16] NeeK_23: handover to whoever MS bring in
[3:37:17] ImperfectDark: yeah, at least EU enforce notice period stuff
[3:37:21] physalis4: wonder if we get community managers again.
[3:37:25] LunarBlizzz: is Zygor a curseforge addon?
[3:37:29] MachoCham: She doesn't say she has been let go just her role is impacted, I know she said there is a longer period of finding out in the EU
[3:37:31] MachoCham: !zygor
[3:37:32] StreamElements: I am using Zygor for my in-game Guides! You can get 20% off Zygor when you use the code "MrGM" and use my link https://zygorguides.com/ref/MrGM/
[3:38:10] LunarBlizzz: @MachoCham ty
[3:38:13] ImperfectDark: did she work for Blizzard? I noticed it said Ireland but i didn't think Blizz were in Ireland. I THINK it could be an outsourcer customer service company?
[3:38:14] Oswaldovzki: How are the work laws there? Are they protected by any means?
[3:38:15] nuclearphosphate: with zygor, i take it i would be better off disabling my current quest addon?
[3:38:25] nuclearphosphate: by that, i mean would they clash with each other?
[3:38:32] Minobard: i wish dark iron got the arch buff like reg dwarves - then they would be the best race for sure
[3:38:33] NateOliveiras: and it all sounds a bit bs. The negotiations went on an on forever. They must've gone over all the details about this merging for years. Yet no one to take overlapping positions in consideration? ugh
[3:38:58] Lausten: How many people are WoW Partners in EU+
[3:39:09] NeeK_23: purely speculative, but maybe colleagues have gone and she no longer feels like its a long term positon anymore and looking for options. I've seen similar where people who survive layoffs choose to left not long after regardless
[3:39:10] jhopps12: @NateOliveiras well the layoffs were 100% part of the merger, part of the plan the whole time. imo
[3:39:17] flgiirl: they got an email in the morning that all meetings were cancelled and that 1900 would be let go and if you got the special email you were one of them. my husband was one of them while in that meeting they immediately cut off access to Slack, etc. Immediately laid off
[3:39:25] MachoCham: Survivors remorse is real
[3:40:20] flgiirl: yes NA based
[3:40:21] MachoCham: @flgiirl I really pray that he finds a new successful position quicky and flourishes
[3:40:46] MachoCham: I'm not searching on my work laptop for redundancy law. I'm not giving them any ideas
[3:40:46] nuclearphosphate: oh, its a yearly subscription> i thought it was a one off purchase
[3:40:55] flgiirl: thank you Macho, he has a few calls out. they did offer a good severance package
[3:41:12] nuclearphosphate: monthly or every 12 months at 99.99
[3:41:16] MachoCham: @flgiirl If there is any signal boosting we can do, please let us know
[3:41:27] flgiirl: will pay for our Cobra insurance for 1 year thankfully
[3:43:15] Harai_Ulfsark: satoru iwata
[3:43:18] SlithTheSivak: Iwata took a pay cut

[3:43:56] NeeK_23: @SlithTheSivak Japan legal enforces exe paycuts before layoffs are allowed by law.
[3:43:57] nuclearphosphate: wasting it
[3:44:03] physalis4: family wealth
[3:44:03] flgiirl: they let go my husband's VP, sorry I don't know the department but Software Developer handling the exceptions process across multiple games
[3:44:08] Minobard: generational wealth that is getting squandered
[3:44:19] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 Becomes a little less "what a good guy" when you know this
[3:44:22] physalis4: It's generational. You're setting your kids up for life
[3:44:25] Lausten: Swimming in it like Scrooge McDuck is my best guess
[3:44:42] Frosty1u1: @NeeK_23 it should be that way no ceo should take home a 100m bonus on top of salary and then lay off thousands
[3:45:01] Holyrain_Tin: well, playing devil's advocate, most people get in debt up to their pay level. so to suddenly take a pay cut might mean losing a home, no longer paying for kid's college, etc. would you take a paycut right now for people making half of what you make?
[3:45:05] flgiirl: agree with you Frosty
[3:45:18] Minobard: a lot of times the bonuses are tied to stocks so they want to increase share value as it increases their personal bottom line.
[3:45:24] ChrisStoll: I'm seeing some reports (unsubstantiated thus far) that Christie Golden was laid off too :(
[3:45:43] NeeK_23: I think it was proposed somewhere that no CEO should earn more than 100 times more than the lowest employee. Even 100 is too much but its a start
[3:45:49] MachoCham: Please can we also remember that it is not managements fault - Decisions will be made at the C level, managers are people and must also be going through a really rough time mentally
[3:45:50] Lausten: @Holyrain_Tin Oh no my loan for the 5th yacht... Oh my life is ruined.. Kappa
[3:46:00] jurassic28: 50mil would last a dozen lifetimes, they dont need that just handed to them every year as a bonus
[3:46:02] Frosty1u1: you reach a level of wealth where a 50m cut to 10m is not gonna matter and if it does you are bad at money
[3:46:30] Frosty1u1: i have no problem with ceo getting bonus if their employees also get a bonus and are paid well
[3:46:34] flgiirl: lol at least you'd have the option to downsize if you make millions and would lose your home with a paycut. unlike those who were laid off
[3:46:35] nuclearphosphate: @jurassic28 i would say more than a dozen lifetimes to be honest
[3:46:37] MachoCham: Yes
[3:46:43] SlithTheSivak: they partake in hobbies we normies cant even imagine, like hunting humans for sport
[3:46:44] Minobard: a lot of them create their own
[3:46:49] MachoCham: Philanthropy is a marketing strategy
[3:47:17] Frosty1u1: like why should a ceo get a huge bonus for the company doing well when the employees that helped it succeed get cut
[3:47:23] Frosty1u1: they should get the bonus too
[3:47:34] NateOliveiras: I work with financial advisors on a daily basis and yes, they literally teach their clients how to diminish their tax liabilities by donating money.
[3:47:42] Lausten: Imagine charity wasnt needed cause everyone shared their wealth instead of piling on top of it like Smaug..
[3:48:23] NeeK_23: There was an article about the actor Tom Hollander who was sent the bonus for Tom Holland for Avengers by accident as they had the same agent. We was happy he'd just done a BBC show for ¬£30k and that would see him for the next year or so, then saw that the first installment for Avengers was 7 figures
[3:48:28] SlithTheSivak: Lets look at how Asmon lives...
[3:48:30] MachoCham: Sounds like a lot of people in chat are describing Socialism
[3:48:35] jurassic28: rich people in general, what is the point of hoarding that wealth?  If you have exactly ¬£1 billion, and spent ¬£1000 every single day it would take almost 3000 years to spend it all, it's just completely unnecessary
[3:49:30] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:49:34] Frosty1u1: @MachoCham not to get political but thats the problem with capitalism because sure the ceiling is infinite but the problem is it doesnt trickle down like they say it should instead it gets hoarded to the top
[3:49:58] MachoCham: Yes
[3:50:05] physalis4: absolutely
[3:50:06] ChrisStoll: Most def
[3:50:17] MachoCham: @Frosty1u1 That's the problem, any system is great until you put Humans in there
[3:50:21] jurassic28: there was over 3100 billionaires as of 2022, and most will have multiple billions, its ludicrous
[3:50:28] NeeK_23: the greatest trick America ever pulled off,was convincing its citizens that socialism is bad for them
[3:50:42] Frosty1u1: @MachoCham yup lol the only problem is humans

[3:51:54] BBMezzy: Especially at Blizzard
[3:51:56] flgiirl: paid decent :)
[3:52:01] WoWRoach: @jurassic28 That's like 0.000032% of the worlds population.  Not all that ludicrous
[3:52:08] MachoCham: Sometimes it's ok to just sit back and focus on your own bubble
[3:52:16] BBMezzy: They're notorious for it
[3:52:23] NeeK_23: I heard that they paid below industry rates
[3:52:23] Frosty1u1: wasnt blizz known for being low ballers for dev pay?
[3:52:45] MachoCham: Yeah the ethos was they paid less because of the blizzard prestige
[3:52:50] MachoCham: on the CV
[3:52:53] NeeK_23: people just wanted to work for Blizz and Blizz took advantage of that
[3:53:04] Frosty1u1: like if i was the head of the biggest gaming company i would have positions pay great with good benefits cause you should WANT people to work for you if you are the best
[3:53:06] flgiirl: they were going to make ppl go into the office, my husband was working remote and we are in FL

[3:53:14] Lausten: its cause Blizzard is a big name in the industry so its a good thing to put on your resume
[3:53:15] jurassic28: @jurassic28 But considering how fucking HUGE just 1 billion is, that is ludicrous.  No one needs that kind of wealth
[3:53:20] flgiirl: that was a big reason he was chosen
[3:53:51] Frosty1u1: shit i would be bragging about how good the employees get treated if i was the head of a hugely successful gaming company
[3:54:10] Frosty1u1: more execs gotta look at costco and nintendo leadership
[3:54:12] Bladejsaken: whats the idrops for?
[3:54:22] MachoCham: Yes you are
[3:54:29] MachoCham: The formatting does my head in
[3:54:29] ChrisStoll: Glassdoor shows Principal Game Designer at 250k to 400k at Blizzard. Senior Creative Director is 200k-300k
[3:54:36] BBMezzy: You do? Keyboard over mobile any day
[3:55:00] MachoCham: I can't reply to customers with emoji's
[3:55:01] MachoCham: KEKW
[3:55:05] NeeK_23: phones ruined my spelling. I rely on auto predict/correct too much LuL

[3:55:40] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:55:49] MachoCham: Yes
[3:55:52] flgiirl: instant messenger
[3:55:54] jurassic28: my work group chat started off very formal and official and now it's more akin to a gamer discord
[3:55:54] uglukz: aol instant messanger basically
[3:55:55] SlithTheSivak: chat channel
[3:55:58] ChrisStoll: Yea. Same as teams.. just a chat/meeting program
[3:55:59] BBMezzy: Exactly that
[3:56:07] WoWRoach: Yeah pretty much.  It's a business chat progam with different channels
[3:56:34] MachoCham: Slack is an industry standard
[3:56:47] NeeK_23: I hope its better than Teams, we use that at work and its crap

[3:58:05] chelfx: I don't see a point of cursive in this day in age
[3:58:06] MachoCham: I mean I'll put it here @olitauren for full transparency. Two time outs for constantly mentioning pussy before, and a disability slur. Want to continue?
[3:58:15] Harai_Ulfsark: well thats because you havent seem me writing in cursive LUL

[4:01:57] lyreilla: I felt like it's a kid too
[4:02:02] MachoCham: I gave them chance
[4:02:03] Lausten: This is a great example why countries need to spend a set amount of their BNP on mental healthcare..
[4:02:07] chelfx: Well..
[4:02:11] chelfx: Anyway
[4:02:14] VenasTheMenace: he went through his whole middle school trolling in chat
[4:02:44] MachoCham: I added "Absolute Degen Arsehole" to the mod comments

[4:04:59] jurassic28: Visions guzuBeliever
[4:05:06] Harai_Ulfsark: i love visions of nzoth
[4:05:17] nuclearphosphate: i hate having to do the questchain to get nzoth raid to show, it should just be available to all now
[4:05:22] grimzero617: You buy vessels from wrathion yeah?
[4:05:36] jurassic28: buy vessel in the chamber of the heart
[4:05:41] Vattss: I actually did some visions yyesterday night'
[4:05:45] Harai_Ulfsark: they really should remove the requirement to enter visions, its so fun now that it should be spammable
[4:06:04] Frosty1u1: no mail muncher
[4:06:06] Frosty1u1: thats me
[4:06:07] NeeK_23: yes but you get enough from the vision to buy another, so its just a first time entry really
[4:06:09] nuclearphosphate: @Harai_Ulfsark that and the nzoth raid
[4:07:00] Harai_Ulfsark: @nuclearphosphate yeah just make wrathion go "champion did you lose your cloak? no matter, I have a few spare"
[4:07:26] grimzero617: I remember getting so hyped when I could clear the 5 mask runs

[4:10:54] Vattss: wrong portal
[4:10:57] MachoCham: Camel Spotter?

[4:11:09] jurassic28: THE WOONS

[4:11:21] Frijid: pick me up 200 cokes please
[4:11:22] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Never been there.
[4:11:30] nuclearphosphate: @MachoCham "mysterious camel figurine" is the name of the addon
[4:11:42] grimzero617: That's the smallest quantity they sell
[4:11:43] Frijid: and then next week, get me more mogsFat

[4:12:05] MachoCham: Can't see it on Curseforge do you have a link @nuclearphosphate ?
[4:12:23] MachoCham: Do you need me to send you any mon√©? (SEE WHAT I DID?)
[4:12:24] Harai_Ulfsark: also in brazil, if you have a formal contract with the company, either you get a notice and work for 30 days + payment as normal, or the company fires you at the spot and gets charged a fine and you also receive even more money
[4:12:26] NeeK_23: isnt mexican coke just normal coke for the rest of us? just the US that has cornsyrup?
[4:12:31] nuclearphosphate: @MachoCham sure, 2 seconds :)
[4:12:37] Layliah79: horrific visions are fun tho
[4:12:51] Layliah79: lol

[4:14:52] Layliah79: Yes @nuclearphosphate
[4:15:22] nuclearphosphate: @Layliah79 what mount i mean :)
[4:15:40] Layliah79: Barber has a toy right?
[4:15:41] Lausten: Theres an addon or WA that shows everything on the map, its quite handy if you're after something specific
[4:15:43] NeeK_23: it does if you unlock the talent
[4:16:14] Harai_Ulfsark: theres the barber
[4:16:21] NeeK_23: sit in chair
[4:16:46] Harai_Ulfsark: no
[4:16:46] Layliah79: prob!
[4:16:51] Layliah79: or clear the area first?
[4:16:56] Harai_Ulfsark: i got my toy from that one and im alliance
[4:17:06] NeeK_23: I did it as alliance, maybe needs more unlocks
[4:17:26] NeeK_23: basically makes you bald
[4:17:27] Harai_Ulfsark: or maybe the chairs are bugged nowadays
[4:18:16] NeeK_23: yes its quikcer
[4:18:32] Dezip: Toy is in a crate in a table to the right of the entrance
[4:18:36] NeeK_23: more kills, more currency

[4:20:45] NeeK_23: looking back, 8.2/8.3 was good content
[4:20:48] Harai_Ulfsark: i also liked visions when it was current tbh
[4:21:03] BusterDonuts: I hated this patch / content, I was in a raiding guild and was unlucky with all my corruption gear.
[4:21:18] BusterDonuts: and just slowly fell off the leaderboard in parses and it felt like complete shit
[4:21:45] Jelky55: @BusterDonuts just buy wow token, buy best corruptions on AH, easy LMAO
[4:21:46] NeeK_23: Rexxar used to be rough i remember. the animals stunning you could end a run.
[4:21:46] Jelky55: LUL
[4:22:14] Lausten: But the vendor didnt have them all, it rotated it was total bullshit choice
[4:22:18] Jelky55: ye  u didnt knew me back then so no m+ :p

[4:25:41] nuclearphosphate: brb, need to collect my car, just passed its MOT :D :D
[4:25:53] nuclearphosphate: its always a worry when your car goes in for its MOT
[4:26:29] nuclearphosphate: it just had to get a replacement heater pipe fitted as the engine wasnt cooling as well as it should (was caused by the very cold weather we had recently)
[4:26:36] jurassic28: pepeJAM
[4:26:53] WochiTV: true
[4:26:58] WochiTV: u should try diablo 4
[4:27:02] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:27:05] WochiTV: is kinda up there as intensity
[4:27:06] Lausten: But it still cant run Crisis Kappa
[4:27:14] nuclearphosphate: @WochiTV diablo 4 is soooo bad
[4:27:22] nuclearphosphate: @Lausten LUL
[4:27:34] WochiTV: is fun
[4:27:37] WochiTV: u get a pet]
[4:27:44] WochiTV: to level
[4:27:49] WochiTV: and give it skills
[4:27:49] nuclearphosphate: honestly, ive not touched diablo 4 since around the second week the game launched given how much i detest it
[4:28:01] Harai_Ulfsark: so its pocopoc
[4:28:04] NeeK_23: I just wish they had rifts like D3.
[4:28:12] BusterDonuts: @MrGM do you have the mailbox mount?
[4:28:14] S3N71: I bought it for the WoW mount :|
[4:28:30] RAF_Sean: Oh goodness I'm back
[4:28:37] Harai_Ulfsark: i bought diablo iv with tokens so im not guilty
[4:28:45] nuclearphosphate: it just plays much worse than diablo 3, enemies are "bullet sponges" (forgive the expression) and theres no feeling of being overpowered like there was with diablo 3
[4:28:49] RAF_Sean: Got sucked into Tali's hate stream for a bit. Had to come up for air
[4:29:16] RAF_Sean: He's very angry yeah
[4:29:25] RAF_Sean: Good little rant on Ybarra
[4:29:27] nuclearphosphate: i play that kind of game to obliterate demons, and given that they level WITH you, gets rid of that feeling of being overpowered
[4:29:33] Iwony: after the campaign is finished it just gets boring fast
[4:29:58] RAF_Sean: Breaks your heart yeah
[4:30:01] Xesol: i feel for all the people but this is nothing new - corp greed happens in every industry
[4:30:02] Etaranel: Why is Tali upset?
[4:30:12] WoWRoach: It should have been expected though.  When one company buys another, several departments and roles overlap.
[4:30:12] flgiirl: my husband's boss was Ybarra, he sent out an email that he had no idea
[4:30:24] RAF_Sean: I loved Horrific Visions
[4:30:31] flgiirl: correct
[4:31:00] RAF_Sean: I still think he was also cut
[4:31:07] amricatt: Oh I'm sure he knew.  Just not allowed to confirm.
[4:31:11] Xesol: even if that were the case he wouldnt have sent out such a tone-deaf tweet as he did last night
[4:31:22] BusterDonuts: what did he do more than being the face of blizzard
[4:31:33] BusterDonuts: actual question; I know you got to meet him
[4:31:51] Akela3: "traveling and spending time with family" is PR speak for let go
[4:32:45] flgiirl: he was VP  of core services, automation, exceptions etc
[4:32:46] BusterDonuts: all his tweets were like, "finally maxed out my second diablo 4 character" but it was like two days after launch
[4:32:48] RAF_Sean: Are you the CEO of Dan-terprises?
[4:32:52] Harai_Ulfsark: they arrive late and micromanage you
[4:32:59] shaypressplay: I was an administrative assistant for a CEO they don't do much their administrative assistant does.

[4:33:46] shaypressplay: and ask us to order their lunch and go pick it up
[4:33:54] Lausten: They get a big bag of money for being the punching bag when something goes wrong
[4:33:59] RAF_Sean: As a tank they were always fun
[4:34:09] RAF_Sean: I know some DPS friends didn't enjoy them
[4:34:24] NeeK_23: they were a real challenge at the time, but the sort of thing that with practice and gear could be overcome, bit like legion mage tower
[4:34:29] nuclearphosphate: ouch.... ¬£290 for the replacement water pump that the car needed O.o
[4:34:48] BusterDonuts: I should probably start farming these
[4:34:51] Lausten: Mages could barely do them alone, then a tank friend came in and was basically face rolling it, it was so unbalanced
[4:34:58] Harai_Ulfsark: i think a feature like that was really missing from DF
[4:35:25] NeeK_23: I did so many that I have a guild bank full of the pets from visions
[4:35:28] flgiirl: and for that we are thankful LOL
[4:35:29] RAF_Sean: Big fucking pass
[4:35:42] nuclearphosphate: i miss being level 120 and the INSANE damage output that we had
[4:35:51] RAF_Sean: lol
[4:35:51] nuclearphosphate: i might be in the minority but i dont care
[4:36:03] NeeK_23: I did torghast on an evoker, its works but the powers are super boring
[4:36:04] SirBarracuda: I've been meaning to go back and get the horse
[4:36:14] S3N71: @nuclearphosphate Yeah I didn't think 120 was a big scary number either
[4:36:30] RAF_Sean: I hope they squish every expansion. It's satisfying, like pushing down the garbage in the bin to make room
[4:36:34] physalis4: I did it in 10.1. It still takes a while even if you blast it
[4:36:35] nuclearphosphate: dyu reckon we would get to such insane damage numbers and levels again?
[4:36:42] Harai_Ulfsark: the first days twisting corridors went live i checked and spent 6 hours in one
[4:36:47] NeeK_23: I wonder if you can kill the Taragrue in torghast these days?
[4:37:30] nuclearphosphate: y'know, part of me wants to go back and see how far i can get in torghast just for the sake of it, and i HATE that place
[4:37:32] Harai_Ulfsark: @NeeK_23 i did kill it once with a group but the jailer timer kicked us out :(
[4:37:33] Layliah79: Clap
[4:37:35] flgiirl: they need Magni in DF
[4:37:59] flgiirl: Yayyyyy
[4:38:07] Layliah79: we'll finally learn what he's been rambling about after all these years! hehe
[4:38:12] Lausten: Cant wait to gather more for him to sniff
[4:38:29] flgiirl: @Layliah79 yasssss lol
[4:38:55] Layliah79: "the wounds, champion"
[4:39:21] flgiirl: or if they will explain who Sargeras was targeting when he threw the sword
[4:39:29] Layliah79: agreed!
[4:39:38] Layliah79: he was targeting the last titan
[4:39:43] Layliah79: Azeroth :D
[4:39:47] jurassic28: azeroth's world soul ofc
[4:40:31] Jack_the_Dipper: Im doing fine. Manthieus told me to follow you or else @MrGM
[4:40:57] Harai_Ulfsark: do you think they were planning on using the sword again before it became a meme? im just thinking of all the time ion was joking about the sword while maybe knowing it would stop being a meme in the future
[4:40:59] Layliah79: he's a gold making machine!
[4:41:40] RAF_Sean: Did you miss a totem?
[4:42:33] Jack_the_Dipper: Jack_the_Dipper subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Tip, every time you see Mantieus tell him to summon his long boi

[4:46:02] Lausten: What year was the long boy removed?
[4:46:13] Jack_the_Dipper: yes
[4:46:19] Lausten: Looking at my email to see how many tokens I bought
[4:46:39] RAF_Sean: Bought 3 this week
[4:46:49] RAF_Sean: Don't even really know why
[4:46:49] Jack_the_Dipper: You can still get it on BMAH but it's rare and mostly goes for gold cap
[4:46:51] alkanphell: i was always goblin in wow making gold is fun
[4:46:55] RAF_Sean: I just like buying tokens
[4:46:57] nuclearphosphate: i bought 7 last week
[4:46:59] MrEvilRex: 3 of what?
[4:47:10] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex WoW tokens
[4:47:13] physalis4: Only way I can make cold is with my debit card
[4:47:14] MrEvilRex: oh tokens...
[4:47:15] Layliah79: never bought one. always just made my gold casually
[4:47:16] RAF_Sean: You got some Dan-tokens I can buy?
[4:47:16] physalis4: *gold
[4:47:21] mossbo: Fine, thanks
[4:47:22] RAF_Sean: Bruh
[4:47:24] alkanphell: i mean i made 1 mil in first few days in DF
[4:47:29] RAF_Sean: You know I have a problem lol
[4:47:35] Layliah79: ton of alts doing dragonriding world quests = great way to farm gold.
[4:47:51] mossbo: mossbo subscribed with Prime. 
[4:47:51] RAF_Sean: Convinced Anjulee she needed a webcam yesterday
[4:48:05] nyrhalahotep: he can split his money with chat
[4:48:18] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 genuinly, im the same, having said that, my monk made 6.72 million gold a couple of weeks ago buying the "rousing" reagents (50k at a time) converting them to "awakened" then selling them on auction for a HELL of a profit :D
[4:48:28] RAF_Sean: PC, Monitor, 2 sets of wave panels, teleprompter, new stand for the teleprompter
[4:48:29] Jack_the_Dipper: There are a lot of ways to makke gold and one of the faastest ways is flipping but it will take time to learn the market and some starter cash. Also learning and addon like TSM is required
[4:48:34] MrEvilRex: last time I played Wow (Legion) gold was ez enough to make, I would still have a couple of thousands left over after paying for a token. I imagine it's even easier to make gold now, from pve rewards I mean
[4:48:38] Big_Rum: If you hit 300 subs your sub counter is not working says 282
[4:48:44] RAF_Sean: Help me
[4:48:48] RAF_Sean: hahaha
[4:48:50] alkanphell: @MrGM when War With in come out take mining en herbing and put all u have on ah for first few weeks.there u go few mil
[4:48:57] Layliah79: i made a ton of gold in SL on mission tables for 10 toons.

[4:49:20] MrEvilRex: what are sub points?
[4:49:30] nuclearphosphate: huh, ive got the grim campfire, ive clicked claim, but its not registering that ive claimed it
[4:49:36] Jack_the_Dipper: @nuclearphosphate and made some good profit?
[4:49:44] MrEvilRex: ah ty
[4:49:45] alkanphell: ez gold each expension works good with mining herbing Chek woweconomy
[4:49:55] Harai_Ulfsark: @nuclearphosphate try another browser, i was having issues in google chrome
[4:50:12] nuclearphosphate: @Jack_the_Dipper hell yeah, made around 5.24 million in profit :D
[4:50:23] CloudyHS: not that it makes it any better but i didnt see anyone on the wow dev team get laid off, so it seems like theyre committed to WoW atleast.
