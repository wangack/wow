[0:39:13] nadak123: <3
[0:39:32] Nerfed4U: busy busy also
[0:40:07] TurboCurse: anyone happen to know.. if you play sodcore (hardcore SSF) do you have to be in THE sodcore guild, or can you do it in an active normal guild.. for the social aspect :-)
[0:40:39] TurboCurse: i do on eu, but im the only lvl 40 :-)
[0:40:51] TurboCurse: guild is dead
[0:41:03] TurboCurse: figured the rules are the same
[0:42:04] gratzitko: aint shit to do now, we got a long time of nothing to do. u got plenty of time
[0:42:11] gratzitko: im on my 3rd 40
[0:42:22] wldot: im raid logging 2 chars
[0:42:23] gratzitko: yeah outside of stv aint shit to do rly
[0:42:33] gratzitko: 25 was alot more fun to me
[0:42:36] Hosz2thePitch: hey man, what were u doing before u became a pro player?
[0:42:40] evermanq111: @TurboCurse if you only play for yourself and ssf on your own rules who cares ? if someone allows it or not
[0:42:40] gratzitko: i agree with you on that level cap was mistake
[0:42:55] Hosz2thePitch: damn
[0:44:10] TurboCurse: not just by myself. im in the sodcore guild, but only very few  players left. 6-7 players between vll 26-33, and then me at 40 :-)
[0:44:24] TurboCurse: we will never have enough ppl to make a dungeon. :-P
[0:44:55] TurboCurse: a normal guild would just be for the social aspect, i still couldnt play with them
[0:45:06] TurboCurse: i love hardcore
[0:45:13] TurboCurse: softcore drains me :-P
[0:45:16] nikthevoker: only 4 LUL
[0:45:22] H_9_K: HC is the only wow I like at this point
[0:45:25] evermanq111: so just play it, why do you care if someone accepts you being in a guild or not
[0:45:34] TurboCurse: couldnt agree more with the artificial rules
[0:45:42] trylez: you probably got this question a lot already but will you compete in the 40 tournament?
[0:45:56] TurboCurse: on hardcore server i was in nihilum guild.. that is dead as well tho
[0:46:37] TurboCurse: Kungen ?
[0:46:49] H_9_K: "are you fookin kitten me"
[0:46:55] TurboCurse: he quit
[0:47:24] TurboCurse: but i really liked the idea of classic hardcore raiding with NO world buffs :-)
[0:47:28] critcobain: No thanks
[0:47:52] H_9_K: Fresh classic HC SSF servers would be the way imo
[0:48:14] TurboCurse: that was a guild rule :-)
[0:48:17] varatupaj: you can play hc ssf anytime
[0:48:18] TurboCurse: lol
[0:48:20] critcobain: that's the chode hammer
[0:48:38] H_9_K: @varatupaj blizz rules SSF server I mean
[0:48:54] H_9_K: It is, but not fresh servers unfortuantely.

[0:49:01] TheMaleNurseLIVE: How do you make restedxp black?
[0:49:12] TurboCurse: the streamer version of sodcore makes no sense
[0:49:14] H_9_K: Imagine server-wide blizzard official SSF. THAT would be so sick
[0:49:20] critcobain: @TheMaleNurseLIVE you beat it
[0:49:23] critcobain: Sorry, that was fucked up
[0:49:30] TurboCurse: quest items not allowed, but rep items (which are so much better) is allowed
[0:49:39] varatupaj: a lot of mobtagging will happen in hardcore ssf
[0:51:49] TurboCurse: hardcore is more than anything a challenge for yourself... if your mindset is how to cheese the rules.. in my opinion hc is not for you :-))
[0:52:02] RealitySuks: !server
[0:52:05] nikthevoker: @snutzy atkeast crafting shit super cheap now
[0:52:13] Relax94: are you not competing?

[0:53:56] TurboCurse: a tournament would be interesting where you played different classes :-P
[0:53:58] Relax94: woulda been nice to see u
[0:54:02] nikthevoker: feral can actually take out SP but ock is sketchy, its nutty LUL
[0:54:25] TurboCurse: moonkin getting even more buffed
[0:54:25] gdkpgold: its ok just get 40 and win the tourney ez
[0:54:45] varatupaj: ive seen so many streamers being happy that lock is not that good this phase
[0:55:09] gratzitko: destro metalock is rly good
[0:55:16] gratzitko: but its lame as hell
[0:55:19] moltencrucible: will you play in the 1v1 tournament next month?
[0:55:20] deltrexx: the event about to start
[0:55:36] nikthevoker: i have level 40 rogue ganking me in arathi
[0:55:37] napzzz1: what rank life tap do you use
[0:56:06] napzzz1: take a chunk of health tbh
[0:56:26] Banksy9813: how do we make affy great again
[0:56:39] gratzitko: locks r def still solid, they just dont feel good to play
[0:56:55] moltencrucible: you think lock beat boomy/sp in 1v1 atm?
[0:56:55] varatupaj: i think soul link haunt is underrated
[0:57:06] ebeanz: meta is all fun an games til affliction shows up and banishes you
[0:57:18] varatupaj: i tried it in bgs and it works really well in small scale fights
[0:57:27] napzzz1: i still dont know what talents to run for pvp affliction wise
[0:57:42] varatupaj: you can run fh and survive meles
[0:57:50] napzzz1: i go all the way into affliction accept for last talent
[0:58:06] gratzitko: once u get alot of hp, affliction can be decent, especially in like ab in small scale fights
[0:58:19] zen_oni_shinobi: kelvin, hey buddy.
[0:58:21] napzzz1: @gratzitko exactly, just need a lot higher HP
[0:58:23] gratzitko: if u run full aff, then no shadow mastery and 5 points in the demo stam talents
[0:58:27] gratzitko: and then u get fort
[0:58:31] gratzitko: plus the 30% hp buff
[0:58:39] ebeanz: it can be but you need peels
[0:58:45] tjzlock: it does decent damage just have to stand behind people and cast
[0:58:46] ebeanz: if melee get on you its over
[0:58:47] napzzz1: casting is so aids
[0:58:47] gratzitko: @snutzy ur way to squishy with 0 pushback resistance
[0:58:50] napzzz1: i cant with destro in pvp
[0:58:52] varatupaj: they made that siphon life snaps with drain
[0:59:00] varatupaj: but its still weak
[0:59:04] Keybex: !addons
[0:59:04] StreamElements: FULL ADDONS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQBL93TO6w
[0:59:07] Dreschnuu: pushback is aids
[0:59:12] Dreschnuu: need to hide in bushes
[0:59:13] Dreschnuu: lmao
[0:59:18] napzzz1: destro for raids pumps hard
[0:59:21] gratzitko: @snutzy the best build is to run full destro, as meta, cast incinerate (to buff ur fire dmg by 25%) into searing pain. with crit talents at 30%. u can 2 shot ppl
[0:59:29] gratzitko: but playing meta feels awful so idk
[0:59:33] napzzz1: the no coil thing is so lame this phase lmao
[0:59:38] danparsonss: hey buddy
[0:59:48] varatupaj: destro meta is a thing, boost that searing pain spam :D
[0:59:56] nikthevoker: thats what they doing n wsg
[1:00:01] varatupaj: its fun to banish meta locks
[1:00:07] napzzz1: same i refuse to go any spec besides affli haunt
[1:00:09] Dreschnuu: meta is the most noobish shit ive ever seen
[1:00:10] gratzitko: it feels awful but its like the only viable spec for bloodmoon lol.
[1:00:15] gratzitko: cuz u can steal hella KBS
[1:00:15] ebeanz: affliction does work in bgs but you're mostly around for control
[1:00:25] varatupaj: sadly they nerfed sujigate, before you could make them your pets
[1:00:35] gdkpgold: @Dreschnuu you mean boonkin
[1:00:39] TurboCurse: lol @rogue
[1:00:45] napzzz1: SNUTZ YOU HAD THAT 2V1
[1:00:48] nikthevoker: this rogue has no life
[1:00:49] shookones: that rogue got smoked
[1:00:55] nikthevoker: i hope his toe falls off
[1:01:05] nikthevoker: level 40 camping level 33
[1:01:27] 1oner__: snutz have u seen the green leather chest that sleeps you for 10 seconds ?
[1:01:57] napzzz1: which realm i can tank
[1:02:01] danparsonss: alliance
[1:02:13] napzzz1: lone wolf rip
[1:02:25] varatupaj: i think blizzard is happy with lock in general because destro is top dps in raids right now and meta is playable in pvp
[1:02:39] gratzitko: @snutzy the good rank shadowbolt we have slaps pretty hard tho, so it makes nightfall procs super worth, i feel like next phase full aff will still be better for bgs than soul link.
[1:02:49] ebeanz: deathcoil at 42 :(
[1:02:50] Wilcox57: What up how u been snutz
[1:03:14] cmf_westers: destro is pretty much in the same boat as ele, insane if they ignore you but hard to play when they focus you
[1:03:15] gratzitko: they jus need give affliction a rune like shadowpriests have (void plague) something they can scale dmg on without affecting regular classic numbers
[1:03:16] danparsonss: feels like they need to nerf dmg by like 40% in pvp
[1:03:19] cmf_westers: and i feel like aff fell off a bit
[1:03:20] danparsonss: the one shot meta is lame
[1:03:28] cmf_westers: meta searing pain spam is alright though
[1:03:36] Dreschnuu: buff shadowflame dmg by like 500% and make it slow lmao
[1:04:32] Wilcox57: Hell yeah you got it made my dude
[1:04:38] jiimmy_x: hey @snutzy good to see you again <3 hope you are doing fine
[1:04:56] gdkpgold: are u one of these food travelers now?
[1:04:58] cmf_westers: neck and wand from GY
[1:05:03] gratzitko: the main problem with locks is having stinky rank dots too. capping to level
[1:05:08] cmf_westers: head and shoulders from Cath
[1:05:16] cmf_westers: and off hand from Lib
[1:05:19] cmf_westers: yea
[1:05:23] cmf_westers: sp is nuts

[1:48:58] StreamElements: All information regarding my addons, characters, or boosts will be found in my discord: https://discord.gg/eMTkkB3
[1:49:07] Tesla369: gy has nice upgrades for lock, the one rare drops pvp neck, sp wand, and the last boss drops the sp offhand
[1:49:20] gratzitko: @snutzy wellhopefully UA will be real damage like void plague is for spriest
[1:49:21] tjzlock: we have elements at 40
[1:49:27] cmf_westers: yea shadow priests are dropping void plague now cause of the same reason
[1:49:37] cmf_westers: too global starved for how short fights are
[1:49:43] gratzitko: thats the problem aff lock has no good runes that bring them dmg like other classes (mutilate starsurge etc)
[1:49:46] cmf_westers: so you play twisted fate  instead
[1:49:59] TommyR44: hey snutz do you know the addon to allow extra action bar ive seen chanimal use it
[1:50:02] Tesla369: aff lock still very good in pvp tho its ok

[1:50:41] sudd7: sp and lock might need flay or drain soul to make dots bleed out faster to catch up
[1:51:01] Tesla369: it would be nice if corruption didnt take 3 seconds to start ticking
[1:51:04] gratzitko: na sp and lock get dot critsnextphase

[1:54:52] rscmadnes: becoming a casual
[1:54:55] doremiqt: @snutzy  i quit lvl 30 cause have no motivation to spam dungeons + friends arent really playing much, and wow with no friends is bad

[1:58:23] Epi__: feel like its not an event where lock shines lol
[1:58:24] Jahesch: stv event is awesome
[1:58:26] gratzitko: since everlasting affliction doesnt getmuch value in these runs
[1:58:29] Tesla369: nah its dog unless you have a coordinated 5 man group w/ good comp and in discord
[1:58:35] conbarz: imagine win trading in SoD
[1:58:39] adeemdoebot: they tried to "fix" layering and now its so laggy its unplayable even at 3 am
[1:58:39] Tesla369: and even then u fight the lag and layering issues
[1:58:43] sudd7: It was bad, then they fixed it, it became good, but then they reverted the fix. cause the rest of the world felt dead, so it's bad again
[1:58:54] glory_time: Imagine not @conbarz LUL
[1:59:18] cmf_westers: honestly I take the lag over the layering issues every day
[1:59:24] cmf_westers: the layering bugs were aweful
