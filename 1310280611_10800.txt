[3:00:44] Jewishraver: im one of those that has the 0.1% ICC drop but no HH after years of farming lol
[3:00:47] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Shit you've never farmed for a Stone of Jordan in Diablo 2 or a Zod Rune.
[3:00:54] CloudPants8081: jokrdChad
[3:00:59] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Zod Rune used to LITERALLY have a 1/1 million chance.

[3:03:34] Jessethoth: @ventu105 No, Diablo 2 is a game from 2000 lol
[3:03:40] Jessethoth: @ventu105 Before all this gatcha shit.
[3:03:55] Jessethoth: @ventu105 We'd trade other High Runes or a bunch of unique items for em.
[3:04:10] ventu105: @Jessethoth theres a Diablo 2 Resrrected is like a remaster of D2
[3:04:14] Jessethoth: @ventu105 Some people were stupid and would trade you a Zod Rune for a full class set, but the Class sets were not worth it lol
[3:04:28] Jessethoth: @ventu105 It's mostly untouched compared to D2, I play it quite a bit.
[3:04:37] tebbix: waytoodank
[3:04:39] ventu105: cool
[3:04:43] Pinclak: !S4

[3:05:25] TheMachine_907: prolly not haha
[3:05:37] ventu105: @Jessethoth yes I saw the phone thing lol they were angry
[3:05:59] PvtHudson093: fuck that
[3:05:59] Jessethoth: @Towelliee It's mobile, I expected all fo this, but outside of that the game looks cool, coming from someone who generally hates on mobile.
[3:06:08] szble: yeah idk about that
[3:06:20] akia03: and you need like what 10 of those gems
[3:06:20] Jessethoth: @PvtHudson093 "You secure that shit Hudson!"
[3:06:33] Alepouditsa: and that y i like games like wow that you pay sub's. immortal for me will be to kill time
[3:06:35] dj_goasoul: and what you win if you get the 5 star gems?
[3:06:35] Jessethoth: @PvtHudson093 I just wanted to say the line, sorry bro. lol
[3:06:43] akia03: 40-50k hehe
[3:06:45] Aquadriel: do you need to pay for stuff to do the story? @Towelliee
[3:06:52] tedol: @dj_goasoul  you lucky
[3:07:23] Thunderbrew: What's cool is you don't have to play this game if you don't like the Micro Transactions.
[3:07:26] TheMachine_907: A shit ton of $$$
[3:07:27] Aquadriel: amazing
[3:07:29] szble: having a pc client for your mobile game is really good
[3:07:31] Jessethoth: I THINK you can technically grind all the power, so I'm okay with that.
[3:07:47] Jessethoth: Who gives a shit if someone can pay for it? That's an inevitable norm no matter how much it's hated.
[3:07:53] KaisenSiru: Pog
[3:07:54] Aquadriel: honestly im interested in story only, cause i am invested in resurrected lol
[3:08:06] AnaBanaGG: Its bad practise on Blizzards part, and they had (still have cause we havent seen it ourselves yet) the chance to prove they can make non-paytowin games for phones that can bgring in revenue in other ways.
[3:08:11] Aquadriel: only*
[3:08:14] Jessethoth: I just hope it's story is more like D1 and 2 and less like D3.
[3:08:20] Utfryst: What game are we talkin about?
[3:08:27] Jessethoth: Immortal
[3:08:34] Jessethoth: Diablo that is.
[3:08:41] Utfryst: Ahh thanks :)

[3:08:53] mandilozano: you can always play it with a simulator
[3:08:59] akia03: just want arclight in wow inns to play ingame :)
[3:09:09] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Ima be honest bro, IDGAF if they monetized Warcraft 4, as long as we got a solid campaign to set up a WoW expansion or something I'd be okay with it.
[3:09:22] szble: btc miner yeah
[3:09:59] MeisterPetze: SPOILER :D
[3:10:04] dj_goasoul: what happened with lost ark? people quit already? :D

[3:10:49] Devildriver007: I still play now and then
[3:10:56] belfastcl: barrier to bot in lost ark is too low, and profitability too high

[3:11:01] ps5skullreaper: What ya farming
[3:11:05] rodschin: 80%bots
[3:11:05] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Subtract the amount that were playing from the amount now and you can find out about how many are bots.
[3:11:07] tedol: Bro, trust me, it's just bots, not players
[3:11:13] Jessethoth: @Towelliee But it definitely has players back.
[3:11:48] dj_goasoul: yeah i cant believe it but its a fact
[3:11:55] Thoreya: meh
[3:11:56] dj_goasoul: or people dont have anything better yet to play

[3:12:15] Drakossbane: easy#
[3:12:16] veryhairyheyyall: I absolutely love playing it and it‚Äôs content
[3:12:16] Rambo0306: The main thing is that WoW subscription method is too outdated to attract new players, to me that‚Äôs the main issue
[3:12:44] dj_goasoul: yeah wow sub has to go down to 3-4 dollars
[3:12:48] dephius: alright Towelliee crew, i just came back to WoW. and i realy want to play a ranged healer. any suggestions?
[3:12:55] Aquadriel: source: trust me bro
[3:13:27] dj_goasoul: if they make x4 more players at 3-4 dollars sub i guess now they are losing money
[3:13:33] Obmxtiny: cn carry alliance Kappa
[3:13:43] chreefrogs: Every que is like 10 minutes
[3:13:47] Clicklesly: @dephius Just go Shaman, even when they aren't the top meta class you'll still have BL to get into groups ^^
[3:13:48] ps5skullreaper: I got the gold for wow token just need a new pc
[3:14:00] TheRiwen: Is there not something about china has put a max gametime for games ti 2 hours per day ?
[3:14:01] Jarwerewolf: Jarwerewolf gifted a Tier 1 sub to Obmxtiny! 
[3:14:10] Obmxtiny: LUL thanks
[3:14:29] tedol: @TheRiwen  for kids below 18
[3:14:43] nephttv_: holy priest
[3:14:46] Rambo0306: Yeah I understand the thing of the WoW token, but for a new player spending 70‚Ç¨ for base game + expansion + 60‚Ç¨ for subriscription is waaay to much, no game costs that much
[3:14:50] Mattdaemun: holy priest
[3:14:54] Aquadriel: holy priest are kiling it
[3:14:55] Reckless_Monk: shaman
[3:14:58] Tyrou: holy priest is main ranged heals
[3:15:00] Dreepi: Poly heist
[3:15:00] mandilozano: resto druid
[3:15:19] dj_goasoul: @Rambo0306 agreed 100%, they need to loosen up a lil bit for sure
[3:15:21] Apokolipz: my maghar hunter heals alliance all the time with my bow and arrow :)
[3:15:46] Ramdorpser: 1 time drop or..?
[3:15:48] TheMachine_907: Game over
[3:15:55] Obmxtiny: wow twitch drops PogChamp
[3:15:55] mandilozano: hell will break loose
[3:15:59] tedol: Microsoft will do it
[3:15:59] Tyrou: they would get a hell of a lot more players if they did that
[3:16:08] Aquadriel: dont think theyd do a month, prolly 7-15 days, or some pet.
[3:16:14] Tyrou: i can see microsoft taking advantage of that for sure
[3:16:16] nephttv_: @Towelliee You need any keys today before i hop on poe?
[3:16:32] TheMachine_907: Epic
[3:16:38] nephttv_: aight sounds good homie
[3:16:41] kharditv: @neph__98 where my auto graph
[3:16:49] nephttv_: oh hi @kharditv
[3:16:59] Aquadriel: yeah 14 is more likely, yet still pretty awesome
[3:17:00] kharditv: @neph__98 how are you
[3:17:05] nyliah: That level 20 free trial is way too little
[3:17:13] nephttv_: @kharditv Pre good just slept like 14 hours lol

[3:17:36] kharditv: @neph__98 still on those degen hours LUL
[3:17:37] Beff_Jridges: Do you think its a hubris thing for Blizz?
[3:17:53] dj_goasoul: they went super greedy with their player and in the end they lost big money in my opinion
[3:17:53] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[3:17:56] KaisenSiru: yyjYEP
[3:17:57] mandilozano: they already  do it for hearthstone
[3:17:58] belfastcl: they aren't idiots, someone must've done the costs of having that kind of wave in and the potential payoff
[3:18:02] Rambo0306: For example by being acquired by Microsoft they could make the subscription within the xbox game pass, and you would still need to pay for base game + expansion
[3:18:04] tedol: I would say it will... but it has chance
[3:18:35] Tyrou: yeah they just started doing drops recently for both hearthstone and overwatch
[3:18:44] belfastcl: I thought blizz had some kind of robust finance team or something
[3:18:51] Shamwise: They wont do it, because they think they dont have to
[3:18:58] belfastcl: running that kind of models
[3:19:02] nephttv_: they forgot xd
[3:19:20] Shamwise: Maybe they fired the drops guys...

[3:21:38] TacDuc: I believe in Phil
[3:21:42] mandilozano: they are going to do YouTube drops Kappa
[3:21:43] FaulkNO: hopefully they just make a better game and more people will come
[3:21:50] tedol: can be
[3:21:56] xaeblue: NEW W OMEGALUL RLD
[3:21:59] tedol: Amazon can play durty
[3:21:59] mavericks312: i mean that would make sense
[3:22:01] idle_swede: that would be illegal
[3:22:18] Clicklesly: Does FF14 have drops?
[3:22:26] bagrain: new world ever come out with 2hd sword yet?
[3:22:29] insane__person: eso has drops too
[3:22:32] gold9871: dont forget to get the third drop from the package for NW
[3:22:32] tebbix: @Clicklesly The black chocobo yeah
[3:22:34] ZEEnitrofx: monopoly ?
[3:22:35] tedol: oh,right, ff14 had drops
[3:22:36] belfastcl: they can just deny them by establishing criteria that blizz won't accept
[3:22:40] Blazzerx: HAMMERS UP POGGERS
[3:22:41] Aquadriel: but new world and LA are less than a year old, drops been there for 3-4 years and blizzard never done anything, so doubt its amazon. @Towelliee
[3:22:43] Kaype92: How is it that I can get  moake onion star in Lost Ark and anguished isle onion star in less than 10 attempts total but freaking elegant won‚Äôt drop after hundreds of kills???
[3:22:49] nyliah: FF14 had the mount for gifted subs thing
[3:22:51] Tyrou: they allow FF14 and ESO to have drops though
[3:22:58] TacDuc: Well, I would be a bit pissed if I didn't get a super cool mount from drops, if I didn't have time to do it
[3:23:26] dj_goasoul: thats awesome news
[3:23:39] TheMachine_907: Amazon doesnt have to give Blizzard anything

[3:25:03] GunpowderPete: are servers still only 2k people?
[3:25:06] belfastcl: I wonder how they are doing monetization wise
[3:25:07] mandilozano: sounds like wildstar
[3:25:08] Aquadriel: Jeffie wouldnt? D:
[3:25:12] YardRage: Papa Bezos don't play around
[3:25:50] belfastcl: the store is very slim
[3:26:31] TacDuc: Then I will play it with all of the many things I've claimed with prime, because you can claim it without even owning the game
[3:26:43] mavericks312: they have to do something thats for sure
[3:26:49] Xanigh: they better not turn the servers off, i spended 10e yesterday to buy bow skin
[3:26:57] nyliah: The game was not at all supposed to be what it is now so they had and have a lot of fundamental things to work on

[3:28:12] dj_goasoul: yes you are right towelliee
[3:28:19] Taz_85: GW2 wouldn't be half of what it is now, if they didn't introduce mounts, imo. They're such a fun feature

[3:29:49] YardRage: I don't need to fly from the start, but no more maw no-mount-type stuff please
[3:29:54] chaotic_kore_1: Any word on DF alpha?
[3:30:00] Baikenator: probably be some kinda gimmick at the start with flying
[3:30:02] TMMOOF: Your right its not even that bad and people still complain
[3:30:16] futomara01: but we still have to freaking do it for the 6th time, enough is enough

[3:36:28] Eviltuna13: Don‚Äôt forget to do the 5 time walking dungeons
[3:36:28] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[3:36:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: It helps
[3:36:33] dwolf010: do you expect alpha start of next month?
[3:36:51] CanadianCataclysm: For alliance its a influx of new players to beable to raid and mythic plus
[3:36:58] Reckless_Monk: allience is getting soo much out of 9.2.5
[3:37:04] Jessethoth: @Towelliee It always made sense to do cross faction, even back in the day, we're mercenaries not conscripts.
[3:37:07] mavericks312: for alliance this is huge
[3:37:10] TMMOOF: thankgod its optional
[3:37:16] Gunfluster: they should have added cross faction with shadowlands release tho
[3:37:24] TacDuc: As long as I won't be playing with gnomes I'm good
[3:37:28] Gunfluster: same as the free swap covenant etc
[3:37:42] CanadianCataclysm: I just sold that sword for 255000
[3:37:45] Zeke_nl: you can see the seller
[3:37:46] Gunfluster: just making the game worse for players early so eventually when they make it better ppl come back ? great strategy
[3:37:48] Zayocast_v2: Some random dudes next season "I have WF Fated Sylvans inv me now "
[3:38:01] RerouteToHell: @TacDuc I mean horde already has green gnomes and furry gnomes KEKW
[3:38:01] Reckless_Monk: @gunfluster my man ur late to the hate train, its been all said.
[3:38:25] TacDuc: @RerouteToHell Goblins are better than gnomes, but yes, it is very hard on me
[3:38:35] Jessethoth: In vanilla
[3:38:40] Jessethoth: It should have been there in vanilla
[3:38:56] Jessethoth: The factions were starting to team up in Warcraft 3 because of Archimonde almost buttfucking the planet.
[3:38:58] FraserWentLive: Alliance needs it
[3:39:01] nephttv_: what are you on about lol
[3:39:02] TMMOOF: clearly didnt play vanilla LUL
[3:39:07] mavericks312: your delusional if you think it should have been in vanilla
[3:39:09] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I mean it was already happening at the end of Warcraft 3.
[3:39:20] Reckless_Monk: butt fucking a tree @jessethoth
[3:39:20] griffdog125: lol person saying that wasn't even playing in vanilla prob
[3:39:21] Jessethoth: @TMMOOF I started in Warcraft 2 for fucking Playstation in 98.
[3:39:23] Rexialiton: @Jessethoth towStop towIt
[3:39:32] Lamyth: I can see the argument for ICC, but not earlier
[3:39:34] Gunfluster: my server was like 1 alliance to 50 horde before legion, maybe a time to start giving it a thought
[3:39:36] Reckless_Monk: get that shit right
[3:39:45] Zayocast_v2: End of BFA was probably the best time to do it imo
[3:39:46] Jessethoth: @Reckless_Monk True LOL
[3:39:47] Effin_Steffin: Cross-Faction All Pandaren Groups
[3:39:54] buffkenobi: i think its an exciting idea but for me personally, not to excited without cross faction guilds.
[3:40:01] Reckless_Monk: LUL
[3:40:05] Jessethoth: Has anyone here played and finished Warcraft 3?
[3:40:14] Jessethoth: Mount Hyjal?
[3:40:22] barberbranford: Is pvp gonna be cross faction?
[3:40:23] Rexialiton: Mate
[3:40:24] Jessethoth: That was pretty much the end of Alliance VS Horde
[3:40:29] Rexialiton: Just stop KEKW
[3:40:34] Jessethoth: They had to make a bullshit story in a book to make faction war make sense.
[3:40:39] Reckless_Monk: everyone replayed in in WoW @jessethoth  lol
[3:40:44] TMMOOF: I play wow for the faction war
[3:40:49] TacDuc: NElf, Orcs and humans were working together at the end of WC3, and said that a new era would start. One where they work together, but as a game it would be weird to just have them as one faction
[3:40:50] Jessethoth: I know you guys are agreeing with Towlie and whatnot but yeah
[3:41:04] Jessethoth: I mean our characters are just mercenaries.
[3:41:15] Jessethoth: You just have the PvP story be that those players are conscripts
[3:41:18] Brodih_: Cata also, together to stop Deathwing from destroying our world
[3:41:25] Jessethoth: Jeez guys, I'm just saying there's a way it could have been done.
[3:41:29] RollDouble77: Didnt they add Mercenary mode in WoD?
[3:41:30] MFKnightS: make it a FFA like BDO
[3:41:32] Jessethoth: Then there wouldn't have been so much drama over racials.
[3:41:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: It makes more sense, the PvE people don't care as much about factions
[3:41:48] Jessethoth: Exactly
[3:41:49] nephttv_: who cares when they do it man, we're getting it now just be happy about it
[3:41:50] Jessethoth: That's all I'm saying
[3:42:03] fat_european0: 100%
[3:42:05] Fyeah: PVP would make sense if there was any alliance left
[3:42:16] Merkuriuz: agree
[3:42:17] Reckless_Monk: Lore wise, ally ane horde will always hate each other
[3:42:25] twistedstick1: you had some of the best world PvP back then.
[3:42:26] RerouteToHell: Vanilla BC really nice everything else afterwards was a shit story that did not make sense most of the time
[3:42:36] FraserWentLive: !s4
[3:42:37] Moobot: @FraserWentLive üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[3:42:51] TMMOOF: Red Blue Horde Alliance Orc Human, get outta here with this xfaction
[3:42:54] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Sure it does, WoW is basically 4, they were just trying to tap into the Warcraft 2 era thing.
[3:42:57] Lupusdeus: I'm all for cross faction grouping etc, but doing it with guilds will mean warmode has to go/be changed, would be odd being in the same guild but cant be in the same faction city. Overall it's positive, but a lot of shit to think about in the long term. @Towelliee
[3:43:02] fat_european0: I remember me & my friends used to talk shit about Alliance players regularly back in Vanilla/TBC
[3:43:08] UnknownLegendDPS: for the alliance DansGame
[3:43:16] griffdog125: lol imagine star wars
[3:43:23] Jessethoth: @Towelliee It's just that draw has died out now, it's hurting the playerbase more than it's helping is all I was saying.
[3:43:24] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce now its time for peace
[3:43:26] Jessethoth: It makes sense now.
[3:43:30] Niksen_99: Will there not be world pvp with cross factions
[3:43:31] Brodih_: imagine if there was friendly fire
[3:43:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think about FFXIV years ago, with different factions in the same guilds
[3:43:43] Lupusdeus: World of Peacecraft KEKW
[3:43:53] Jessethoth: If it had been designed in 2004 from the ground up that way is all I was saying.
[3:44:03] Reckless_Monk: Azeroth is ower home - Anduin AkA Domination Bro
[3:44:07] Eviltuna13: The Gnome Army will be in full force come Tuesday crreamWaddle
[3:44:18] TMMOOF: amen
[3:44:20] UnknownLegendDPS: for the horde SMOrc
[3:44:22] RerouteToHell: @Niksen_99 from what I know if you are not in party everything else is as it was. But we do have War Mode and nobody is in War Mode anyway KEKW
[3:44:23] Zolshy89: true
[3:44:24] tebbix: KKona red =bad for me
[3:44:25] futomara01: up until cata this wasnt a problem because there was 12million players
[3:44:29] CloudPants8081: jokrdKEKW
[3:44:31] Jessethoth: Let's be honest here...........
[3:44:35] Niksen_99: Chasing gnomes for hours back in the day
[3:44:36] Jessethoth: The only true enemies are rogues.
[3:44:41] MrLebowski_: I‚Äôll be pvping on alliance come 9.2.5
[3:44:45] Lupusdeus: @Jessethoth TRUUUUU
[3:44:47] Jessethoth: Fuck rogues.
[3:44:49] obamasmanager: !9.2.5

[3:45:15] UnknownLegendDPS: D: @Rexialiton
[3:45:20] RedZeab: they need to do something thou the balance between horde and alliance is bad really bad when it comes to higher content
[3:45:22] tebbix: Warmode is such a good system imo
[3:45:22] Jessethoth: Fly up in the air and bomb me while I can't hit you, some bullshit lol
[3:45:34] Jessethoth: It just needs better incentives.
[3:45:34] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!

[3:46:11] MayroVision: F the Horde, ally til I die
[3:46:24] UnknownLegendDPS: BibleThump @Rexialiton
[3:46:25] CanadianCataclysm: Keep Warmode. Just make it so if you are the party leader it converts your party into what ever faction is the leader for warmode and you fight in open world as that faction
[3:46:25] CloudPants8081: murdaGrin
[3:46:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: One of the biggest causes for faction imbalance in PvE is being fixed, that's true....for PvP servers it's different, those people want easy mode
[3:46:28] nephttv_: @Towelliee thats gonna be a real thing come tuesday " NEED LUST ONLY HORDE "
[3:46:31] Zeke_nl: got damn imagine they start asking for race requirements to join M+ LUL
[3:46:32] Lupusdeus: We have some hordies gonna join our community next week. I'll be very welcoming and i know they're cool ppl but my raid warning will still include "welcome...but fuck the horde ;)" (and i would say the same on the alliance if i was a hordie haha)
[3:46:42] RerouteToHell: I love so much that I started doing my keys so I do not have to deal with the Bots selling KEKW

[4:06:03] Niksen_99: Tyyy @warrenny
[4:06:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: BM is not bad, it's just low on the DPS list....bringing the player not the class, they are capable
[4:06:38] ceranac23: all spec can play until 25 keys but why play bm when u can spam bombs and do giga dmg
[4:07:30] SavageCheez: Not always about the damage, its about playing the game the way you want to

[4:09:37] J_Rich94: i saw another streamer doing BIG dps with a marksman hunter the other day

[7:30:05] Rictamar: yeh the game then becomes acquiring sets and making builds
[7:30:09] Rictamar: or pvp of vourse
[7:30:46] Kisswani: this is proof that dragons make every story better
[7:30:55] vulkankragon: @Gylduran i got bored after cp 400. i need that gear threadmill to keep me hooked.
[7:31:46] Rictamar: @vulkankragon yeh I'm like cp lvl 504, what keeps me engaged is the new story content every so often, and I still need to level two classes, but I drop in and out for sure

[7:37:21] Joitch: Or well i used to react to it, actually reading it would be a stretch
[7:37:34] RocketMan23: just seems like so much clutter
[7:38:05] Joitch: Its what i was used to i guess
[7:39:01] vulkankragon: has he done the molag bal storyline?
[7:41:15] SicDogg: @Towelliee do u have a Noble chair ??
[7:41:53] Joitch: Are the undaunted dungeons still a thing?
[7:42:26] vulkankragon: @Joitch yeah everything is still the same
[7:42:29] portend: "Time to slay the dragon!" Wrong game, right concept. BloodTrail
[7:44:12] Joitch: Ive been hearing that more and more lately
[7:44:21] Jedaero: The no-build game mode has totally reinvigorated Fortnite for me
[7:44:24] Joitch: The removal of the building seemed to have done its job
[7:44:42] Frank4LuLz: Towelliee smoking those coco-puffs again\

[7:46:02] Timothious: did you spend your cp points?
[7:46:06] Joitch: Are taunts still hard to come by?
[7:46:35] vulkankragon: the combat is definitely the weak point of this game
[7:47:17] TompsonX: Pent up? SqShy

[7:48:26] dneario: you like it?

[7:56:56] stratiss: yeah your doing 3k dps lol
[7:57:06] SuperSteve43: DPS is king!
[7:57:25] SuperSteve43: 1 million! Dr evil.
[7:57:28] stratiss: as a tank not much
[7:57:41] SuperSteve43: ^
[7:57:58] stratiss: u need to main stat either stam or magicka to speed up kill times
[7:58:40] vulkankragon: @adxx each eso expansion adds 2 dungeons and 1 raid. other than that there's housing. thats it for endgame.
[7:58:42] killahsin_ce: its more than just main stat for speed dps though
[7:58:44] SuperSteve43: @towelliee you doing dungeons with viewers ever? asking for a friend lul
[7:58:47] killahsin_ce: its buff stacking cross bar
[7:59:07] stratiss: if go heavy on magicka attributes then u need magicka abilities and vice versa for stam
[7:59:54] killahsin_ce: at launch eso tanking was much more fun
[7:59:59] SuperSteve43: no worries home. just curious.
[8:00:11] killahsin_ce: because you could create dps tanks and heal tanks blah blah
[8:00:15] Rictamar: this is why when you build a character on a class you choose stamina or magicka
[8:00:35] killahsin_ce: it changed dramatically when they tied certain abilities to their preq trees
[8:00:35] Killdrek: Veteran dg is more fun
[8:00:38] killahsin_ce: heavy light etc
[8:00:40] d00dledan: !Marathon
[8:00:40] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[8:00:43] Rictamar: and if you are going tank, most builds go full health, or like a 70/30 split between health and magicka or stamina
[8:01:03] killahsin_ce: u used to be able to use skills associated with trees in other bars i.e. heavy skills qwithout heavy armor
[8:01:14] swervity82: does anyone have the screenshot of his addons?
[8:01:24] SuperSteve43: small tip about blocking. it will consume mag or Stam depending on higher pool. this may be why your mag drains quicker.
[8:01:26] killahsin_ce: it was more open ended so you didnt just have to sit and puncture
[8:02:01] killahsin_ce: evasion tanking was a thing, heal tanking.
[8:02:05] killahsin_ce: yup

[8:02:09] Rictamar: the other thing with tanking dungeons, you only really taunt the dangerous enemies, not every single one in the pack
[8:02:42] vulkankragon: there's no aoe tanking in eso
[8:03:31] killahsin_ce: u can but you have to use homogenized armor sets created for that purpose. You arent really creating your own hybrid build anymore.
[8:03:47] killahsin_ce: and youc an aoe tank still too its just noiwhere enar as effective as it was before

[8:03:59] killahsin_ce: nowhere near*
[8:04:52] killahsin_ce: sap tanking using evasion was so fun at launch
[8:04:55] Kisswani: F
[8:05:25] Matygon: good morning! you're doing great! CP points after level 50 will make a big difference in your dps. Plus getting max gear at CP 160. You're in that weird leveling zone where you're about to make a big jump in dps.
[8:05:42] killahsin_ce: most of those nerfs and changes resulted from people creating 1v10 pvp god chars
[8:05:47] Ghostpuddlez: is this game f2p?
[8:06:35] Killdrek: @SumoSoup No, its not

[8:07:29] Ghostpuddlez: @belfastcl thanks
[8:07:58] stratiss: it does because u need 160 cp
[8:07:59] Rictamar: not really anymore
[8:08:06] Rictamar: true though ^
[8:08:17] belfastcl: at 50 someone could craft you a new training set
[8:08:20] stratiss: the game really doesn't start until your 160 cp
[8:08:20] Rictamar: getting CP 160 won't take that long tbf
[8:08:34] Matygon: you want to keep going after 50 til lvl CP 160, wont take long, then youre at max gear forever
[8:08:39] Chiraakitteh: You aren‚Äôt really at max lvl until you hit CP 160
[8:08:55] killahsin_ce: yup maty
[8:09:22] Matygon: hi @killahsin_ce !
