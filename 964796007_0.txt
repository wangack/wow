[0:36:54] Murlocz: @towelliee Hows druid leveling in classic?
[0:36:58] the_sleepy1: i played do much during the classic wow beta it burnt me out
[0:37:01] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Literally all i want to do is test some gold farms and shit. First thing I do if i get beta is go to Zangarmarsh and get my mote extractor recipe and then farm 4 primal lifes for it LUL
[0:37:06] BRUTALIT0PS: It'd be fun to test it, but it would make the actual release less fulfilling imo
[0:37:12] Sniper_Penguin: 5 more months of CN?
[0:37:40] Playwisme: I kinda dont want to get into beta, i plan to play a lot come pre-patch, dont really wanna burn out before then
[0:38:00] Sincline387: depends on what kind of issues we see in the beta

[0:39:53] Phindrius: Nope, sub price has never really changed in the UK
[0:40:00] CritcobainTV: Oof
[0:40:05] Murlocz: It was legit 25-30% increase :(
[0:40:10] hateful88: I think it also depends on when Blizz's fiscal quarters start and end. Would make sense to get TBC out before the end of a quarter to push quarterly numbers at the end. Then 9.1 to further push the next quarter with strong numbers
[0:40:12] Colt_Engineer: those tank changes are awesome
[0:40:16] the_sleepy1: so leveling your Bloodelf.  is the 0-60 time the same as vanilla?  or is it faster in BC  I can remember.. then again I just used my 60 back then
[0:40:24] TheEnstraynomic: i wonder if people are gonna complain about the tank changes making prot paladins OP in pvp again
[0:40:25] Glozki: somebody said bots would buy subs for cheaper in those countries idk the truth of that

[2:14:39] abxos: thats on them not you lol
[2:14:56] ChalupaBatman25: i remember towards end of TBC ret was actually viable. i'm debating weather to use my boost for a paladin or just main a warrior
[2:15:03] gizmo94: I mean they're naxx geared, they know how threat works. Pally or not
[2:15:06] karisa_vibrant: At 70. Just bring a hunter and Threat is a non issue
[2:15:48] abxos: warlocks have the built in wait for consecration cause our dots dont tick right away

[2:16:26] GonoFPS: not because they have naxx gear that they are good players tho
[2:16:42] bottledxselfesteem: nah, ret in bt and sunwell where doing pretty big dam
[2:16:48] GonoFPS: give my man a chance to build some threah, takes half a second thats it
[2:16:53] bricko89: Level cap on beta or cna go all the way to 7 0?
[2:16:54] mceslex: what? warriors have a lot of "taunts", mocking blow, etc.
[2:16:55] Playwisme: with all the gdkp in classic, naxx gear doesnt mean good player
[2:16:58] ChalupaBatman25: i still remember when wrath pre patch hit, in make shift ret gear as a prot paladin you could 1v5 people
[2:17:07] coozecontroll: yeah I remember doing shattered halls in like 4 pulls with this one pally tank
[2:17:11] rohdey: is it the zone thats making everything green?
[2:17:23] Darkasi_: Watched your video on Shadowlands.  I worry for this expansion, and I really want it to be good but another slog of an expansion like WoD with little content is going to hurt the game long term.  I am thankful that TBC is coming out to satiate my content needs.
[2:17:30] elmokid1: Does thorns help generate threat once they are hitting you?
[2:17:46] gizmo94: That's how I felt on my bear once I got geared. Thorns up, enrage, charge in, swipe spam and laugh
[2:17:48] rohdey: i mean, it looked like there was a filter, like you were dead/in an instance or something
[2:17:57] qwerth: just got the off hand warblade on my fury warrior, sweating bricks with the rolls
[2:18:01] Brandonhipster: I think covid was a big part of the expansion
[2:18:14] ScalarGaming: towelliee called it even before exp was launched
[2:18:19] TheEnstraynomic: SL is so lacking in content to the point that i'm researching EVs to pass the time until 9.1 NotLikeThis
[2:18:20] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:18:40] bottledxselfesteem: @Towelliee  you are the first streamer i have seen talk about tbc who actually knows what he is talking about in regards to tanks in tbc.. i was in a server first guild in tbc and we ran prot pal and feral druid pretty much tier 5 and on
[2:18:42] Yoitsnova: wc3 khadgar lol

[2:18:44] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: CHADGAR POGGERS
[2:18:50] beckett3a: og Kadgar looking like the Warcraft 3 hero
[2:18:54] CrusaderNero: magic
[2:18:55] PixelBotBrand: Khadgar doesn't skip leg day
[2:18:55] sega_mega_dry: if youve watched breaking bad
[2:18:57] Honax_Official: Gandoff?
[2:18:58] potposky: khadgar the wthie

[2:19:13] scenario17: just joining in, how's beta going so far
[2:19:14] szble: the lore was he got older after outland happening
[2:19:19] Rayman_1990: @OzusTeapot huh ? there was no Khadgar in wc3
[2:19:20] Brandonhipster: Even if there a store mount its the people fault for buying it
[2:19:32] NewWorldReign: Boomer Khadgar
[2:19:38] mceslex: but the TBC mount will eventually come to the store? FortHype
[2:19:57] mceslex: FortHype
[2:19:58] ceefast: old khad gar model PogChamp
[2:20:07] ChalupaBatman25: if people are whiling to buy store mounts, blizzard would be stupid to not cell store mounts. if no one bought them they wouldn't waste time and money making them
[2:20:24] shadowxw4lk3r: @Brandonhipster  stupid logic
[2:20:29] Killaahurtz: kiting fel reavers to shatt the good old tbc times
[2:20:51] nashwhole: Store mounts are good. They help fund development of the game. It's your choice to buy them or not.

[2:21:49] Radkuse: I don't really care, it doesn't affect the gameplay directly and it's just a mount HahaThink
[2:21:55] GonoFPS: it doesnt change anything, waste of time, we went over this for classic and now all over again
[2:22:07] GonoFPS: I argued with you back then and you were right

[2:22:54] Fioray: I spend too much money on Mogstation in FF XIV. But hey, i like pretty things.
[2:23:08] Brandonhipster: Companies keep doing it if people keep buying it. Example LOOT BOXES!!!
[2:23:08] Darkasi_: The WoW store is nowhere near the store that SWTOR has and for that I am thankful.   The store offerings are lite and I am fine with that.
[2:23:10] nashwhole: Cosmetics sell and they're totally cool. Pay to win is bad.
[2:23:12] mceslex: what if, blizzard just says, you know what, the tariffs, we need to increase the subscription to $21.99, but no micro transactions?
[2:23:31] Radkuse: Yeah I don't mind purely cosmetic microtransactions
[2:23:33] ChalupaBatman25: the amount of in game earnable mounts there is compared to store mounts it never bothered me
[2:23:35] kajun_predator: good to see you in the flesh and bone brother @towelliee
[2:23:47] Playwisme: I dont mind mounts, pets etc. What I dont like are lootboxes
[2:23:47] abxos: My thought on store mounts. As long as there are difficult to acquire, cool mounts available only in-game im ok with them
[2:23:47] bottledxselfesteem: look at Destiny 2, EsO, WoW, so on and so forth
[2:23:48] PixelBotBrand: I paid £60 for Street Fighter 2 on my SNES - videogames are the same price 30 years later, it needs to update.
[2:23:51] Kromede: raid gear KEKW
[2:23:57] GonoFPS: oh yeah thats a no no
[2:24:02] chrslp: I HATED THIS QUEST KEKW
[2:24:13] Runkel: Cosmetics are just the first steop of being greedy
[2:24:14] chrslp: Takes 9 years
[2:24:14] Bimmer535: just got 4/10 mythic with my guild feels good man
[2:24:30] Kromede: pretty sure ppl bought it
[2:24:30] Brandonhipster: idk why rift did that. That MMO had the potential to be good
[2:24:38] Chuckforfun: need to wait ;D is like a 5-10 min quest
[2:24:40] Twigz_KC: takes forever
[2:24:42] mceslex: blizzard should do that for Sunwell gear LUL
[2:24:52] The_Boctor: pepega to win
[2:24:55] Goggetta: "Follow me, stranger. This shouldn't take long."
[2:24:57] Goggetta: biggest wow lie
[2:24:59] CrusaderNero: think we will have dual spec in BC?
[2:25:00] Runkel: Rift did pretty much everything right in the beginning, loved that game
[2:25:03] Rayman_1990: most of games have potential to be good, but they fail Kappa
[2:25:07] karisa_vibrant: Aion did something simliar. It was good as sub game. went free and the cash shop pay to win took over
[2:25:12] VevoxGaming: idk they gotta make money somehow, if it doesnt interrupt gameplay who cares
[2:25:19] Jawis: LUL
[2:25:20] mceslex: I quit WoW then played rift the just quit gaming lol
[2:25:20] GonoFPS: it's not like store mount are a huge deal to begin with, who says "wow look at this op hunter on a store mount"
[2:25:21] ChalupaBatman25: i'm still kinda mind blown that rift is still up and running, but wildstar had to shut down
[2:25:24] GonoFPS: it wont change nada
[2:25:38] Sandman_88: ESO loot boxes KEKW
[2:25:38] GonoFPS: boost is good will keep TBC alive for longer (arena)
[2:25:41] nashwhole: Guy in guild chat said he feels helpless without questie. Wowhead was the way back in the day
[2:25:47] Jawis: I don't see a problem with cosmetics being sold inside a shop ingame
[2:26:00] theDirtyon3: ESO has that shit too
[2:26:14] Kromede: gamigo, so bad
[2:26:14] cyrSalts: Questie was huge pog for vanilla
[2:26:18] ThomasN77: why is there a lonely farmer and a goat there?
[2:26:18] Brandonhipster: I just loved the class system more then WoW. Love how rogue could tank and vice versa
[2:26:24] Brandonhipster: for rit

[2:26:40] DocsMistake: 5 grand in bags
[2:26:41] mceslex: haris pilton
[2:26:44] Playwisme: i thought that bag was unique equip?
[2:26:53] cruzeal: wildstar had one too
[2:26:55] Finarato: as long as you dont HAVE to buy something who cares
[2:26:58] CrusaderNero: ashes of creation looks rather generic MMORPG
[2:26:58] Kysnar: rs3 does, osrs doesnt
[2:27:01] Brandonhipster: @Azradath the games not out yet so we dont know yet
[2:27:01] Madfrak: rs3 does osrs does not

[2:27:24] Mcfailadin: towHi
[2:27:27] Playwisme: or im just mis-remembering
[2:27:28] Lappfan: im pretty okay with stores aslong as there isnt lootboxes casuse thats just gambleing
[2:27:34] abxos: its not a big deal, the gold is all copied over and it doesnt mean anything in beta right? =P
[2:27:41] mceslex: I play World of Tanks and they have a store P2W and loot chests, the chests are like slot machines FortHype
[2:27:44] Lappfan: that you buy for real money that is
[2:27:57] Ranger208: Sparkle Pony
[2:28:08] GonoFPS: I bought the fire helm, its still ugly to this day
[2:28:08] CrusaderNero: wasnt that mop
[2:28:10] TheEnstraynomic: i remembered when people were whining about the sparkle pony mount too
[2:28:12] Brandonhipster: I know people complain about a store mount in WoW but look at all the other mmo's out there. Most are the same but no one complains about them
[2:28:13] VevoxGaming: The only thing i think is a mistake is classic gold transfering into tbc :(
[2:28:15] GonoFPS: it doesnt fit on you well, weird thing
[2:28:18] nashwhole: @curseclassic that's huge, you da best
[2:28:25] Deathu: That's like saying "who cares this single player game is online only, everyone has good internet" the idea is that in the future those servers will be gonne and the game would be dead.
[2:28:43] lm4rky: wait so u can boost chars in classic soon?
[2:28:43] Azradath: does ashes have a release date?
[2:28:43] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:28:44] Runkel: Blizzard did
[2:28:44] ghostofnappa_doom: I think the biggest problem was spending 50$ on a video game once a month was a big deal back when we were all young, but over time it's become a lot more normal to spend 100+ bucks on a game a month anymore. some people just don't think about the price increase over the years
[2:29:00] Deathu: The whole issue with the store is that its taking away from in game content, mounts and transmog sets that could have been behind a quest or achivment theyy are now behund $$
[2:29:04] dutchie76: how goes it Rob
[2:29:05] Kromede: raid gear Kappa
[2:29:07] dutchie76: how goes it chat
[2:29:22] chrslp: Store or subscription. Server costs, continued development costs, etc
[2:29:27] Ranger208: They do it so they can get as much of your money as possible.
[2:29:28] beckett3a: yup p much, they can do p much whatever they want, they own the mmo market
[2:29:30] dutchie76: shadowblands
[2:29:31] Brandonhipster: @Towelliee But money grows on tree's. So they dont need more of our money to operate
[2:29:32] GTmask: LUL
[2:29:33] dutchie76: LUL
[2:29:35] Resmundo: LUL
[2:29:35] TheEnstraynomic: not to mention people buy those items, so blizzard knows the demand for those types of things is there
[2:29:36] chrslp: Just because the game is released doesnt mean the costs stop for the company
[2:29:45] ChalupaBatman25: @deathu the random store mount doesn't take away from in game content
[2:29:49] dutchie76: no cap on soul ash anymore LUL
[2:29:50] nashwhole: I don't mind pitching in $20 for a cool cosmetic every once in a while to support a game I religiously play.
[2:30:04] CrusaderNero: but theres a sub :O
[2:30:10] Runkel: Just skip the topic tbh. i enjoyed the beta streams so far and this whole topic ruins it for me tbh
[2:30:14] ghostofnappa_doom: like why is there nothing to do in shadowlands, like in Legion they added world quests and Mplus and it was a lot of things to do because it was new, but in BFA and SL's they just rehashed the same features, haven't added anything new and expect people to just do world quests every day and have fun

[2:30:16] beckett3a: IMO Classic will give blizz more time to work on each Retail patch, as people can just go play classic in between patches
[2:30:18] Chuckforfun: yes
[2:30:20] nashwhole: Even on top of that @crusadernero
[2:30:23] Chuckforfun: you need to buy it
[2:30:24] dutchie76: i am looking forward to Rome remastered Kappa
[2:30:26] Chuckforfun: first and sub
[2:30:26] Resmundo: just sub yes
[2:30:29] Jokervenom1978: I own every single item for sale in the WoW store and i dont give af. towHAMUP
[2:30:30] Brandonhipster: Companies have to pay bills/pay employee's and servers to maintain it
[2:30:33] ChalupaBatman25: people forget it costs money to keep just to have servers up and running not even making content
[2:30:37] KevElPrime: Just a sub from what they said
[2:30:42] mceslex: but a store in TBC, not this game BibleThump
[2:30:44] Resmundo: no box prize, just sub
[2:30:44] Deathu: @deathu Yes it does.... wdym xD every mount or pet could be in-game content, a quest or achivment or raid boss drop.
[2:30:51] Scojan: its just a sub at launch
[2:31:01] Playwisme: i heard a thing where a lot of wow subs are older now with more disposable income, not 18 and broke. I wonder if blizz is just capitalizing on this with boosts/mounts etc
[2:31:02] Azradath: does ashes of creation have a release date yet?

[2:31:07] dutchie76: INB4 TBC comes out before 9.1 LUL
[2:31:14] Brandonhipster: There will be a Store
[2:31:25] Resmundo: as long the store is only cosmetics, i dont realy care
[2:31:35] Ranger208: Lets not pretend that WoW would be canceled if not for the store. I don't disagree having one, but it's about money, that's it.
[2:31:36] Brandonhipster: if it all cosmetic then im fine
[2:31:38] nashwhole: @dutchie76 It might, not sure what they really need to test here in TBC
[2:31:40] tehswede: asmon is just toxic af
[2:31:52] Espartico: nah he is not
[2:31:53] Phunsox: I guess that means that they are confident in their product
[2:32:04] Brandonhipster: @Towelliee I know POE is free but they have soo much QOL stuff on the store to help them pay the bills
[2:32:11] ChalupaBatman25: @deathu go look at the numbers, how many store mounts are there vs in game earnable mounts. if you really think the amount of store mounts there is, is a significant amount that "takes away" from in game content then you are bat crap crazy
[2:32:11] dutchie76: yea @nashwhoIe
[2:32:12] ghostofnappa_doom: can't get a 200 million bonus if you don't have a box price on a game, think about it
[2:32:17] abxos: I think Ashes model is "build it and the players will come" like they are relying on us old mmo players who want a new mmo that is actually good and not littered with monetization
[2:32:34] laughing_octopus: @tehswede hes always been toxic .. hes just acting wholesome toxicity bites back xD
[2:32:36] CrusaderNero: its not about making money and make sure employees gets payed. Its about making as much as possible so the top dogs can have a big payday every year. They make enough already
[2:32:39] dutchie76: no Scryer scum?
[2:32:41] LorienV: Khadgar looks like ass lmao

[2:33:54] GonoFPS: well I think
[2:34:00] Inapropreate: yes
[2:34:10] Playwisme: Do they make enough though? I'm betting those top dogs would disagree
[2:34:24] cabalish: always set it where u questing
[2:34:25] CrusaderNero: @Playwisme its never enough, thats the point
[2:34:27] Brandonhipster: yeah b/c you cant fly
[2:34:32] beckett3a: shattrath music too, the goat
[2:34:35] Hjolt: i remember some strange shit with and the map in 2.1.4

[2:34:45] ZIKERZ: wait whatwere the flying lvl s
[2:34:46] karisa_vibrant: Space Goats!
[2:34:51] ZIKERZ: 65 for 100 flying ??
[2:34:51] GonoFPS: check ammo vendor if he got the goods
[2:34:51] nashwhole: @cabalish True, guess I'm thinking of when questing is done
[2:34:56] TheEnstraynomic: i remembered that people would die by jumping off the aldor elevator, but jumping from the scryer elevator is survivable
[2:34:59] ZIKERZ: 70 for 250??
[2:35:01] NewWorldReign: Do you remember the mounts you had to farm for, like Kael'thas drop?
[2:35:02] ezpiron_tv: @Towelliee scryer for early tanking, and aldor for late game tanking
[2:35:04] Tripow: gotta make that lionheart executioner
[2:35:28] Deathu: @deathu I think your argument is invalid, not saying there are less mounts in wow to get thenn the store all im sayinng is that instead of like 340+ in game optainable mounts you would have 400.... if the store didn't exist*not sure how many are in the store but ofc if it continues you'll get there xD*
[2:35:33] TheEnstraynomic: quartermaster was in the bank
[2:35:34] GonoFPS: aldor vendors are in the bank thing

[2:49:28] TheEnstraynomic: not to mention all the salty and toxic people in BGs too
[2:49:30] Finarato: lol first thing i did when i logged onto wow again was /leave 1

[2:50:34] bruhSit_farmer: just ban em ez buh byeee
[2:50:37] mceslex: retail isn't toxic because there's no talking to other players LUL
[2:50:53] beckett3a: yeah hard agree, classic wow gathers a LOT of toxic people
[2:50:55] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: lol

[2:51:24] Infinitepeeep: @subbingtouglypeople any my classic wow trade is filled with people selling DMT buffs and Boosts?
[2:51:32] Bobs_Adventure: Since everyone was so hyped for classic and now everyone is hyped for TBC when does it end? what expansion do you think blizzard should stop at? @Towelliee
[2:51:33] GonoFPS: there a reason why they went on p servers to begin with
[2:51:36] GonoFPS: just gonna say that
[2:51:45] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: DxCat
[2:51:46] Brandonhipster: Yeah Area 52 trade chat was all about politics
[2:51:53] OzCreamz: Yeah they seen to be massive elitists
[2:51:54] Brandonhipster: had to get away from it
[2:51:59] bruhSit_farmer: yea its all EU
[2:52:02] TheEnstraynomic: the private streamer sweatlords seem as toxic as smash melee players for similar reasons
[2:52:03] bruhSit_farmer: toxic andys
[2:52:07] kekwnano: @Bobs_Adventure its probably gonna stop at Wrath i be surprise if they go further
[2:52:08] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: GlitchCat
[2:52:14] Gorestack: only big brain topics
[2:52:15] ghostofnappa_doom: man doing world quests in maldraxxis, the bots in this zone is WILD
[2:52:16] PageFault74: Yeah that's one thing I do miss, seeing political crap all day long
[2:52:27] mceslex: parker chat lol
[2:52:30] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: TehePelo
[2:52:31] MrGattz: @99problemsbutakappaisnot1 i cant tell if youre a bot or not cohhHmm
[2:52:36] mceslex: parler
[2:52:42] Kysnar: @Bobs_Adventure In my opinion they should not do the world change with cata. So stop at wrath. But saying that I want to experience panda land/legion again. wbu?
[2:53:04] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: not a not CoolCat
[2:53:07] bruhSit_farmer: moonkin bot farms wild in retail
[2:53:12] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: bot
[2:53:13] ghostofnappa_doom: There's the Boe 2x8 farms going on, plus the travel form druids with another bot riding them running around grabbing herbs.
[2:53:15] Infinitepeeep: thats normal drop rate wdym
[2:53:18] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: Keepo
[2:53:36] MrGattz: @99problemsbutakappaisnot1 well your last 17 messages are just 1 emote. lets try to participate a bit more lol
[2:53:39] kekwnano: @Kysnaros i would love for them to stop at wrath give it a break then just jump to MoP classic servers lol
[2:53:43] Bobs_Adventure: @Kysnaros tbh my fav expac must be Wrath/Legion.. Legion purelly cause it was just insanely broken and fun. buut as an ex warrior player i do wish i could live through Gladiator Stance warrior from Draenor
[2:54:13] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: DxCat like emotes more
[2:54:31] meatshield2012: its been like that haha
[2:54:39] bruhSit_farmer: heres an idea for retail bots towellie, i rekon blizz should potentially do jucier resource nodes or exclusive nodes for war mode only (therefore we can kill bots in war mode)
[2:54:41] meatshield2012: was always so long to complete
[2:54:44] mattisx: I remember this quest from original TBC, it was a tough droprate
[2:54:54] Brandonhipster: @MrGattz He speaking the future. Soon people will talk in only emotes instead of words LUL
[2:54:54] Kysnar: @nvn0 jumping to MoP would be cool
[2:54:58] Infinitepeeep: @Towelliee drop rate seems to be normal :)
[2:54:59] elvia_: not a bugged, worst quest in Zangar
[2:55:01] Bobs_Adventure: What do you think about the new payment changes? taking away the 30 day sub and forcing a 2 month sub as a minimum?
[2:55:13] MrGattz: i mean.. sure. but it looks a bit weird in chat. im just telling ya because eventually another mod might see that and not ask if you are a bot lol @99problemsbutakappaisnot1
[2:55:18] IamZephi: you get quest items when you don't have the quest, and get rid of them. when you have it and need them, they don't drop
[2:55:23] Kysnar: @Bobs_Adventure I miss glad stance on my warrior too. such a unique spec
[2:55:25] chrslp: Blizzard laughs in "Working as Intended"
[2:55:43] MrGattz: @Brandonhipster i mean have you seen todays kids? they do that anyway
[2:55:48] ghostofnappa_doom: you must complain about the drop before blizzard will free you
[2:55:51] Brandonhipster: True Mrgattz
[2:55:53] bruhSit_farmer: idea for retail bots towellie, i rekon blizz should potentially do jucier resource nodes or exclusive nodes for war mode only (therefore we can kill bots in war mode)
[2:55:57] geokouts: go to the south at the Big guys, you will have a quest there and they drop it more often
[2:55:59] GonoFPS: @hjo1992 oh yeah for sure, there is tons of ways we can go about bots as a community
[2:56:12] Gorestack: one of the best feelings about TBC is that Hellfire Peninsula to Zangarmarsh transition
[2:56:29] mceslex: Mike morheim was watching and he gave you the loot
[2:56:51] Bixster: if you increase the note size from 10 to 20 they run around with 20 druids instead of 10 :)

[2:57:16] raymond3195: just see bonnie bots killing mobs for mount drops
[2:57:17] Scoodles91: dont aply for skinning...
[2:57:25] bruhSit_farmer: problem is retail prices for resources are so soooo watered down its becoming pointless
[2:57:29] raymond3195: bommies
[2:57:36] Brandonhipster: druid/botkins
[2:57:42] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: RaccAttack
[2:57:55] GonoFPS: @hjo1992 bot scripts aren't that advanced, I managed to bug 4 of them today by pulling an extra beetle and not skinning it, the bot script couldnt get past it all they did were spamming regrowth
[2:58:03] Coox69: skinning is a thing too on retail just only the wq's that hyperspawn mobs that are skinable
[2:58:05] rilsolo: dont worry blizz nerfed the fuck out of some skinning spots that non bots used cuz fuck mail and leather wearers LUL
[2:58:06] drRoswell: cant remember last time i have seen bot in retail
[2:58:14] GonoFPS: was funny ahj
[2:58:19] drRoswell: claasic is full of bots
[2:58:32] bruhSit_farmer: true @GonoFPS i come across alot doing mass aoe skinning and also following each other to nodes
[2:58:36] Gnral: just moved to a wrath private server  feelsgreatman
[2:58:37] Infinitepeeep: 39man AQ40 GDKP LUL
[2:58:41] Infinitepeeep: on beta
[2:58:44] Infinitepeeep: common bruh
[2:58:53] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: lol
[2:58:54] GonoFPS: in retail bots go after herbs, they make a ton of druids in travel form + another toon on the back, double tap every herb
[2:59:05] GonoFPS: I should have recorded these bots lol
[2:59:05] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:59:22] Apokolipz: hail hydra
[2:59:39] ghostofnappa_doom: classic was 60 seconds, tbc it was changed to 3 minutes if i recall
[2:59:41] Infinitepeeep: hell yeah it does
[2:59:43] GonoFPS: always druids with a mix of hunt/dh on top
[2:59:47] TheEnstraynomic: i think they changed the breath duration sometime during TBC
[2:59:49] MrGattz: yeah classic you only have 60 seconds
[2:59:50] GonoFPS: I followed about 40 for a good 2 hours
[2:59:55] raymond3195: they should fix so map shows quest points
[2:59:55] MarkWaffle: Yeah you did some olympic breath training
[2:59:55] GonoFPS: I made well over 150k Id say
[2:59:57] bruhSit_farmer: how good its tbc music and amvience
[3:00:00] bruhSit_farmer: is*
[3:00:07] GonoFPS: then I reported them ofc
[3:00:11] Infinitepeeep: undead best race change my mind
[3:00:13] DonSmash: do you think we will have a overrun of certain classes in TBC?
[3:00:15] Infinitepeeep: for classic
[3:00:31] Dubstepwubs: lmfao same
[3:00:31] CrusaderNero: @Infinitepeeep how can you play something that is dead

[3:00:39] bruhSit_farmer: i love both tbc and wotlk tbh in terms of music + ambience
[3:00:45] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: CoolCat

[3:01:20] ChalupaBatman25: wrath music was next level, i have that shit playing when ever i play wow
[3:01:26] Kronvig78: I´ve always felt TBC had the best music. But thats just me
[3:01:31] CrusaderNero: dont let the wording fool you Kappa
[3:01:34] bruhSit_farmer: yea music and zone atmosphere has always been a huge pull for me since vanilla
[3:01:39] Marmoh: Zangarmarsh is basically therapy with its music and aesthetic
[3:01:43] silodin: All i know, it's not WoD Keepo
[3:02:00] 99problemsbutakappaisnot1: LUL
[3:02:01] TheEnstraynomic: the freezing circle damage is no joke, i got hella trolled by those back in the TBC days

[3:27:51] desmo7: nope its classic, you will see them again ;)
[3:27:56] arcticanomaly: I have no issue with the boost. some people have nostalgia for TBC but not classic and I don't think we should be excluding people from the content they're excited for by making them slog through a dead 1-60 experience. wow has evolved, the people playing has evolved and with modern players approaching it with a modern mentality classic and tbc were never going to be the exact replicas people wanted
[3:28:15] Pallananana: ring of bloos is going to be nostalgic leveling FeelsGoodMan

[3:41:06] Jokervenom1978: I'd really like a combo of modern and classic talent trees.
[3:41:18] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: Having the illusion of choice just kind of *feels* better, even if you end up with a "cookie cutter" talent layout.
[3:41:50] raymond3195: problem is you don't have much choice in bc trees you had to go a certain build
[3:42:39] Jzstyles: too pricey to change too often

[3:54:58] TheUnknowing: Kind of wonder why people think beta is a free pass to be toxic
[3:55:00] MrGattz: imo they shouldnt even say anything. just let people go ham and then collect a massive list of toxic players to ban all at once
[3:55:19] Jzstyles: and ban em on live not just beta
[3:55:40] MrGattz: well depending on how bad it is yeah
[3:55:41] Collected1: MrGattz : yup agreed. nice big ban wave and take them off retail too.
[3:55:47] shortyforthewin: thought you ment the harbor place there on the map
[3:55:51] Collected1: zero tolerance
[3:56:32] chrslp: elite pat incoming Kappa
[3:56:38] MrGattz: it should be zero tolerance but blizzard is to soft these days. they will just give out a few weeks to 6 month ban
[3:56:58] Collected1: no excuse as far as im concerned. and if they genuinely don't know it's not cool then it will be a nice little life lesson for them
[3:57:31] kodtheog: tbc is the only good expectations left for this year for blizzard so hoping for the best
[3:57:43] Noshpan: Blizzard has always been soft on bans
[3:58:08] mykologist: @NosA52 not reckful
[3:58:22] chrslp: @Noshpan Unless you bought gold in BC-WOTLK. Then you got perma banned LUL
[3:58:27] joey_sparx: God slave pens brings back such bad anxiety
[3:58:48] kodtheog: tbc is so hype
[3:58:51] Collected1: i remember in vanilla the first time i took that lift not realising it was an alliance hub. rekt.
[3:59:12] ju_limon: Hello, I am a potential new player. I would like to know if its worth starting from 0 in classic at this point?
[3:59:27] joey_sparx: Am I getting slave pens confused? Which dungeon is the one with the final boss in the water at the end?
[4:00:05] MrGattz: yeah slave pens
[4:00:08] assman_ny: Ahh I remember the first time seeing Zangermarsh

[4:00:31] joey_sparx: @mrgattz Ah yeah it was the one I hated WutFace
[4:00:41] Collected1: zangermarsh was stunning compared to hellfire

[4:40:07] Talason: towelliee what is your /played on all your toons combined?
[4:40:21] nazvar: the grind is to brag to other pple and like it ^^
[4:40:28] ybvisible: @Pyaya Thanks dude, guess I got wrapped up watching these 'top tier' videos and such lol
[4:40:38] cashaga: The world is once again in peril and the factions need to come together and travel back in time to defeat the ancient Old god to save Azeroth.  WoW: Repetition
[4:40:49] Talason: i have that 210 trinket away because i already had it
[4:40:53] nickyjams1: You hate Shadowlands that much?
[4:40:54] Talason: gave*
[4:41:05] flowrez4k: @ybvisible nah, that's only for the hardcore raiders, unless you do that, every class and spec is viable
[4:41:19] GoobleGamingTV: Zangarmarsh was my worst zone to complete back then. Nagraand was bis imo
[4:42:03] AlexIncorporated: The Jailor aka " Sexy squidward" has a super secret plan to control the world. We will just N'Zoth him
[4:42:06] TheUnknowing: tbh I wont be surprised if they bring TF/WF back in a form, if they cap it its fine
[4:42:59] sLogOG: and now they remove the system completly LUL
[4:42:59] cashaga: worst thing ever to happen was item level, they should of just added alot more variety and on equip effects to add variety and variation, not the SAME EXACT GEAR +1 +2 +3
[4:43:37] flowrez4k: @Towelliee how's playing prot pally in TBC feel like so far? I'm waiting to play it so much
[4:43:49] Quakezilla69: do you ever think they will move in the direction of BC and Classic where, for the most part, all the raids remain relevant until the end?
[4:44:23] Aaradin: They should have never gotten rid of spell resists either, so you had to farm resist gear too for certain encounters.  It took an entire aspect of the grind out of the game.
[4:44:31] Ranger208: I think the seasonal approach is better for retail because it makes it easier to get back into the game in the middle of an xpac
[4:44:41] flowrez4k: @quakezilla69 they keep adding catch-up mechanics for new players so I don't think that's ever gonna happen
[4:44:41] alex12645: you fergot how op palys are in tbc
[4:44:42] Alepouditsa: maby the are useing rank 1 spell to LUL
[4:45:22] cashaga: i still remember warriors in AV wearing full frost resist gear in like phase 4-5 in classic where my 2k frostbolts hit them for 295 dmg
[4:45:26] sLogOG: imagine they were so kind that they used lower rank spells not to make you look bad LUL
[4:45:33] verdant85: is down ranking spells still a thing in TBC?
[4:45:43] alex12645: LUL

[4:46:21] Villie: what are u looking for?
[4:46:25] cashaga: DST was best trinket in game lol
[4:46:49] BlueBeast33: Something like Kara staying relevant for the whole expansion is a big reason why it's loved so much
[4:47:05] Melonbrew: oh forgot about the little things  like getting dismounted when entering the water

[5:24:26] DegenerateHaven: maw of souls was pog
[5:24:35] MrGattz: i loved grimrail. thats the dungeon that the devs like went in detail explaining how they did it and they spoiled that the train was actually staying still the whole time the scenery around you want actually moving past you. fucking mind blowing
[5:24:54] JrMint82: Stone core was the worst in Cata

[5:30:35] Ribbwich: Thal'sath or something
[5:30:35] ClassicMalcontent: HFP first then Nagrand felt bigger. Even Terrokar Forest. But possibly because by Netherstorm you were close to 70 and flying.
[5:30:37] darkside72: Negrand was always my favorite zone.
[5:30:39] Ysida: i was really fan of tbc but i quit classic after p5 and really don't want to back to it.

[5:31:28] Vanhoek: You feel shadowlands is that big of a flop that the devs are already looking at 10.0?
[5:31:31] idenkaz_: well imagine from there on out a .3 patch never comes again because we showed them they can do it.

[5:44:09] allinex_wow: @Merlin840 Thank you. I just joined the stream and missed it.
[5:44:13] Broomba: Most sequels can’t hold up to the org
[5:44:17] nvpfoo: Do you think TBC has taken away development time on shadowlands ?
[5:44:21] JigglybeanTV: It was always gonna be tough to follow such a classic movie. The de-ageing was good though
[5:44:30] Ribbwich: @Broomba that's what my dad used to say
[5:44:32] Merlin840: @allinex_wow thats just so you can't take a crushing blow.
[5:44:33] Broomba: @nvpfoo nope
[5:44:34] ClassicMalcontent: @Broomba sad but true.
[5:44:43] Neowanderer: they even made a joke about sequels sucking
[5:44:44] DenTza: The best part about Coming to Ameraca 2 is that it makes ppl interested in the first movie LUL
[5:44:53] shade_of_arun: at the top of tower iirc
[5:44:57] JustChrisPhillip: South, big building

[5:45:03] ClassicMalcontent: @DenTza yeah basically ha
[5:45:22] Ribbwich: @Broomba basically, even Godfather 2 isn't as good
[5:45:24] JustChrisPhillip: Go south
[5:45:30] JustChrisPhillip: Its at the bottom of the village
[5:45:30] Coox69: down south

[5:47:29] flowrez4k: @chippy0819 1-60 is easier, takes less xp, 60-70 is fairly long but much more fun than classic zones
[5:47:30] Thunderbrew: STNG is a bit funky the first season, 2n season forward is really good
[5:47:39] Thor2k4: @Frank4LuLz preach it
[5:47:40] chippy0819: @DenTza Thanks! i startted play towards then end of TBC first time around so dont remeber as much

[5:48:34] Brandonhipster: LUL
[5:48:35] Ribbwich: Speaking of, @Broomba First Contact is a good sequel
[5:48:39] SlonkiJippi: bots
[5:48:41] Rawuk: just joined did he level from lvl 1?
[5:48:44] Foogalicious: typical
[5:48:46] Rawuk: or got beta boost?
[5:48:46] silodin: toxic smh
[5:48:51] DenTza: LUL
[5:48:58] Ribbwich: @Towelliee they came there to RP
[5:49:02] Quimby54: wait and tag it from em
[5:49:04] Quimby54: they deserve it
[5:49:05] Ezekyler: you betyrayed the Alliance! D:
[5:49:10] Ezekyler: betrayed*
[5:49:14] SlapaH03: draenei players seqElbow
[5:49:18] Broomba: @ribbwich have to revisit first contact
[5:49:22] andaigan: Why would you start botting on tbc beta
[5:49:25] andaigan: even
[5:49:43] goatmeels: beta testing bots lol
[5:50:01] LecterSRK: theres still no point in botting though
[5:50:02] uberhart: yeah testhow it works, sad
[5:50:06] Brandonhipster: probably testing there bot program
[5:50:08] andaigan: prepping their bots of tbc I guess :P
[5:50:11] Ribbwich: @Broomba it's the best TNG movie. Generations is okay, I never bothered watching Insurrection, and Nemesis is not only important to canon but also absolute dogshit
[5:50:13] Ezekyler: imagine being mad to not be invited at an Friends & Family Test danKEK
[5:50:20] Spaede: I thought it was pretty limited to friends/family. Weird
[5:50:26] Collected1: MrDestructoid
[5:50:31] Elswango: gold selling on tbc beta
[5:50:35] Symast: As someone that stopped playing classic after phase 3 do you think I can get into BC without feeling behind on gold or gear?
[5:50:38] cashaga: friends?
[5:50:43] KyzenHD: I don't think it's random people, only streamer, friend and family tbh
[5:50:45] einself111: most bots just gonna boost to 58 and go straight to brd worked for them for years
[5:50:45] SlapaH03: i demand a key now Kappa
[5:50:50] Collected1: Spaede : it was at first but this is a short test generally so the gaps between waves are smaller
[5:51:01] Longlastnamae: Here is a question I'd liked answered. Which severs will be hub servers for the mergers and ttransfers
[5:51:06] Broomba: @ribbwich that’s the one with borgs?
[5:51:13] Elswango: phase 3 was BWL
[5:51:22] Symast: I was a self funded main tank all my gold disappeared pretty quick
[5:51:25] jasonbriggs: most of the wow streamers i watch have tbc beta
[5:51:32] Ribbwich: Nemesis is the Romulan civil war thing that kinda sets up Picard
[5:51:49] Wardog442: Speaking from experience, maintaining consumes for raiding is very expensive. The average player doesnt have thousands of gold
[5:52:02] Villie: all of crusade got in (esfands guild)
[5:52:07] Broomba: First contact has the borgs that Picard has to deal with

[5:52:13] Vanhoek: I guess a shit ton of that Apes guild got in to the TBC beta. Esfand said like over 100 people in his guild got in too
[5:52:18] ClassicMalcontent: No Beta for me! Still levelling alts in Classic pre-TBC so all good.
[5:52:30] Ribbwich: @Broomba yeah the one where the borgs go back in time kekw
[5:52:33] Crunkledore: how many xpacs do we have to wait for Inquiaboom version 2?
[5:52:33] Thoreya: they send invites last night?
[5:52:37] Collected1: JOE, JOE, They're inviting real players into the beta Joe towJoe

[5:52:54] Broomba: @ribbwich that was good! I enjoyed ST 4!
[5:53:09] MrGattz: i miss the synthwave music
[5:53:15] Vanhoek: Lets be real here people 90% of you guys only want tbc to log in play around with the new talents and not actually play/test the content.

[5:53:57] Collected1: racism in chat
[5:53:59] Collected1: idiots
[5:54:06] Thoreya: ppl were bein asses to zorbrix on twitter when he tweeted
[5:54:08] cashaga: imagine being a Beta LUL
[5:54:13] Vanhoek: People got banned on beta? what happened?
[5:54:15] Broomba: What happened??
[5:54:19] Collected1: ban their accounts i say
[5:54:24] MrGattz: @Allvarez it doesnt prevent dmca, it just lets you keep the vod up until someone manually comes around to shut it down
[5:54:32] veryhairyheyyall: 420 blaze it! @towelliee :)
[5:54:33] KaisenSiru: squadDolmes squadDolmes
[5:54:40] Heekss: I actually thought only ppl with an account in "good standing" got invited, so if you're a toxic prick, you prolly are in bad standing?`It used to be like that atleast?
[5:54:40] iunbearable: That’s just WOW in general.
[5:54:41] Shrenko: new lightning in the background @Towelliee ? towPog

[5:54:51] Vexicrypt: yikes
[5:54:52] itsbananas01: Kappa Also Asmon got banned for copying MoM on the beta
[5:54:52] Valzark: @Towelliee so blizzard lied and didnt give it to vetrians players
[5:54:53] angryhonkinggoose: thats quite tame
[5:54:55] Shrenko: hope they banned their whole account
[5:54:57] Harch: classic players are legit weird
[5:54:59] stratiss: sounds like classic players
[5:55:00] Kaihrn: beta is poss for anyone so fo sho you going to get toxic kids trying to get in
[5:55:04] jasonbriggs: well they should be banned from getting beta acess in the future
[5:55:04] indiana__cones: It's not the true experience without that stuff though, right?
[5:55:05] Blackhaxx: classic players LUL
[5:55:06] Vanhoek: @itsbananas01 MoM?
[5:55:11] idenkaz_: actually big ybikes

[5:55:20] AelyzZ: Imagine racism in 2021
[5:55:21] Kaihrn: i mean they prolly dont even play wow lol
[5:55:28] Jzstyles: idk why you need to emphasize in the beta, those people shouldnt exist in game at all ban em everywhere
[5:55:52] saggyslays: Still up? Hell ya!
[5:56:06] Longlastnamae: If you want to see toxic. Come to Bigglesworth. Let a rend not get announced. The amount of salt and vinegar that flows is astounding
[5:56:11] cashaga: Bloods red Shits brown we all the same
[5:56:23] KaisenSiru: They do.
[5:56:26] kosatbf: @Towelliee Can you explain to how the old character models have better animations then the new? It really bugs me haha :)
[5:56:36] 無職提督: im pretty sure they do
[5:56:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:56:42] 無職提督: esp ur under level
[5:56:52] buffility: do they use improved graphic for classic tbc?
[5:56:58] Iruka_Senpai: way less LoS aswell
[5:56:59] raldrik: I think it is the same range its just that an extra mob in retail you can usually deal with not so much in BC
[5:57:12] MrGattz: i really hope so
[5:57:14] Bendjaova: worth leveling a toon in classic right now or just wait til TBC?
[5:57:18] Vextalin: They should get there accounts ban
[5:57:38] einself111: @zerjohn yes it is worth
[5:57:43] ExtraCrazyFool: !server
[5:57:43] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.

[5:57:52] bimyouX: @zerjohn until 20, then wait for tbc prepatch. You will have enough time to level and it will take way less time
[5:57:54] ClassicMalcontent: GG Blizz invite idiots but leave most of us out of the TBC Beta.
[5:57:55] Collected1: we can all help police the game by reporting comments like that
[5:57:56] Broomba: You poke the bear too hard you get owned
[5:57:59] mytherel: its more manual work
[5:58:19] Ribbwich: @Towelliee the people in the tweet bitching about how beta testing isn't a privilege.
[5:58:45] MrGattz: playing the entire game is a privlage
[5:58:53] MrGattz: we dont even own our accounts
[5:59:03] Talason: towelliee when you gunna start doing beta giveaways
[5:59:04] dSaipher: what-about-ism
[5:59:07] Kaihrn: maybe blizz goofed up and invited a load of Kazzak eu players lmao
[5:59:07] Ribbwich: @MrGattz with the big heat, my man
[5:59:10] Thoreya: its such a bad mindset for the game lol
[5:59:12] Thoreya: sigh

[5:59:34] Nauticca: Nauticca subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[5:59:37] MrGattz: we should be thanking blizzard for allowing us to play their game for the last 15 years ffs.
[6:00:10] iunbearable: If you have enough honey, you can get away of anything lol
[6:00:12] Ribbwich: @Towelliee the bad energy is the guy saying if Zorbrix has time to ban people on the beta they have time to change soul ash systems
[6:00:19] Talason: brooma were you here when towelliee was on justin tv
[6:00:23] bouncybuttt: looking very cute today @Towelliee
[6:00:25] Broomba: @mrgattz that’s the sad thing and reality - too many are spoiled and think they are privileged and deserve special treatment
[6:00:42] Broomba: @talason yes since 2010

[6:02:20] LecterSRK: its a rule of thumb but it depends on how you take care of it and how healthy you are
[6:02:21] ChosenRonin: well the balding gene comes from the moms fathers side if your maternal grandfather isnt bald or then you will not either
[6:02:33] Frank4LuLz: @boomslanggamingx  cant sat the T word

[6:08:16] Waspire: and u grab the escort on the way back
[6:08:20] almighty_h0lm: remember the 2 other quests before you go tho
[6:08:26] MrGattz: @The_L_e_o_n yeahh... its not looking so hot haha
[6:08:42] cashaga: gear doesnt matter in SL only ilvl
[6:08:46] jasonbriggs: there are 2 that give blesings
[6:08:49] happycorgixd: @Towelliee they let you boost a belf pally in beta?
[6:08:56] almighty_h0lm: you might have them, but there are 3 quests in total in the cave
[6:09:06] almighty_h0lm: yes, cool
[6:09:48] Vanhoek: How long you think the beta gonna last for @Towelliee
[6:09:48] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:10:11] MrGattz: solid sum up really haha
[6:10:17] Hammarskjoeld: How are you finding tanking as prot paladin in tbc beta? You think T3 with some mixed def pieces will be enough?
[6:10:22] The_L_e_o_n: ring worm, gotta look it up what is that shit
[6:10:30] ghostofnappa_doom: So Towelliee what do you think they need to do for Shadowlands to not make it so stale and people quit so fat
[6:10:33] Nyvill: even tho its less buggy as you said?
[6:10:35] ghostofnappa_doom: fast
[6:10:43] Vanhoek: How long was the classic beta?
[6:10:46] Zeakon92: PogChamp
[6:10:49] DenTza: Oh, TBC will last A LOT longer. There are so many more things to do. The arenas alone is such a game changers.
[6:10:52] DenTza: changer*
[6:11:08] DoubleNova: do they have a reduced development team for shadowlands?
[6:11:20] bruhSit_farmer: Shitshowlands
[6:11:33] Zeakon92: xD
[6:11:35] MaX_DutchyW: World buffs will be gone in tbc right?
[6:11:39] Fezo93: Lol blizz doing that on purpose so when TBC comes out even retail players try it, cause theyl be so bored
[6:11:40] cashaga: do they give streamers and people in general a list of things they want tested or like target areas or is it just play go ham
[6:11:44] MrGattz: @The_L_e_o_n its a fungal infection. usually something you get at the gym but dogs can pass it on to. hes not entirely sure how he got it but hes just now getting off the meds for it. its mostly harmless.
[6:11:48] krajar96: 155 officers now! nice!
[6:11:52] love_eggplant: i think they have a bad workflow, other companies are doing BETTER
[6:12:04] Thoreya: what companies are doin better
[6:12:07] love_eggplant: riot games
[6:12:12] love_eggplant: they are pumping more content out than ever
[6:12:21] The_L_e_o_n: Towelliee is just huge dog lover, thats it, MrGattz Kappa
[6:12:26] shrektard69: how long do you think the TBC hype will last
[6:12:28] lanara233: I'm working from home too and I admit, I'm only about 75% as productive as before
[6:12:33] cashaga: league just rotates buffs and nerfs and its auto pilot for a season lol
[6:12:33] bruhSit_farmer: Shitshowlands
[6:12:40] love_eggplant: eh no
[6:12:44] rambaldi00: I saw your video via Asmon. Strongly agree
[6:13:07] love_eggplant: @CASHAGA riot has more games than league alone
[6:13:15] YZIOHP: wfh is kinda tough my 6 year old son wonders why I'm locked in my study all day

[6:13:39] silodin: pfff i could do that over the weekend
[6:13:40] cashaga: I cant wait till Diablo 4 comes out and i toss my life at it for 2 months and it flops
[6:13:51] ShadoodHD: and let's be honest: can you really get work done when you start at home with families and/or roomates next door?
[6:13:51] Gizimoo86: yeah like 70 % mmorpg fail or die
[6:13:54] bruhSit_farmer: Covidlands, wow is in maintenance mode waiting for 9.1 aka the vaccine
[6:13:55] Frank4LuLz: coke and hooker partys
[6:14:17] jjoohhs: peoples expectations of video games is so high even those people don't know what they want
[6:14:22] Domi98_: i don't think covid is preventing them from increasing soul ash gain so ppl can play offspecs
[6:14:24] GarSeason: I kinda like Shadowlands, I just wish it was more Legion like.
[6:14:45] Sinfullsarge: Warlock in TBC? good choice?
[6:14:49] Furyio: I'm working from home a year managing a dev team, its not easy, but needs good leadership, tools and communication. Can be done, but definitely its harder shipping product
[6:14:49] bruhSit_farmer: The problem with SL its all pretty on paper but the game feels extremely hollow
[6:14:55] Warcraftnerdy9130: @Towelliee is it from working at home, or is it like wod content draught
[6:14:57] cleartone: !tbc
[6:14:57] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.

[6:15:10] spanij: @Towelliee SHIT I CANT DOWNLOAD MAN I FROM INDIA
[6:15:24] Gorestack: that happens when all content is game is just same content with scaling @hjo1992
[6:15:29] cedemusic: Marsh Dredger for allied race!
[6:15:41] ghostofnappa_doom: Instead of every single piece of work you're working on having a boss be able to walk over mid shift and look at and critique and question and make changes you now have to wait for them to send their work progress in each day at end of day, so that right there slows progress greatly
[6:15:57] Shrenko: India towPog
[6:16:01] squirmyjay: hes the red guy below
[6:16:02] ShadoodHD: yea there's also a lot of technical issues working from home too
[6:16:03] StraightErro: @Towelliee to spice things up, should they re-add the need for resist gear back into the game? Like needing frost for sapphiron, or fire for Ragnaros? Cuz right now, damage type really doesn't matter anymore for the most part
[6:16:08] ChosenRonin: I program defense systems for the DoD and i work from home and we havent fallen behind on a single project using covid has an excuse is not the case for programmers. If they fell behind its because they were not ready to have people have access at home to log in and do their job.
[6:16:09] Nyvill: get lost 4Head
[6:16:21] hefestas: slootDerp
[6:16:36] Furyio: @ChosenRonin DOD...so you have, like gazillion dollar budgets, get a grip
[6:16:56] bruhSit_farmer: What are the chances of blizz bringing back AP towel ??
[6:17:01] lanara233: Even at a tech-savvy company like Blizzard, I bet they still had to spend time digitising internal processes and maybe still are
[6:17:05] ChosenRonin: @Furyio no I work for a company that does DoD contracts
[6:17:11] ZyntosAran: @ChosenRonin dont count from you to others. I also work as a developer from home, and there are BIG communication problems.
[6:17:11] RealFragkos: play moratal online @Towelliee
[6:17:14] DoubleNova: lmao

[6:17:47] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:17:48] stratiss: department of defense
[6:17:48] silodin: ìmagine having a 7 gazillion dollar buget KEKW
[6:17:49] VGSquirtle: department of defense
[6:18:00] SayraphimThePriest: What server you playing on darling?
[6:18:02] cashaga: @jjoohhs your right maybe, Has our opinion of video games and content became so high brow that the quality demand is artificially inflated to the point of becoming ostracized and unrealistic for publishers to deliver fully developed content
[6:18:03] MxkeD: he was agreeing with you homie
[6:18:05] Eitha: I believe Blizzard also has for the most part had a /no/ work from home policy prior to this, they had nothing ready for this specific thing.
[6:18:05] MrGattz: blizzard devs need to be in constant meetings and communication with all the other devs and designers and artists and directors
[6:18:07] ghostofnappa_doom: Johnny where's our policy on what to do when everything shuts down and everyone has to stay at home? we don't have it? Damnit Johnny!
[6:18:07] MrGattz: its not that easy
[6:18:08] ShadoodHD: i mean look... LUL oh god i cant concentrate
[6:18:10] ijuki: My government agency wasn’t ready
[6:18:12] Valzark: DoD dont have adealine LUL
[6:18:17] Valzark: deadline*
[6:18:21] Jokervenom1978: Just look at how many games got pushed back from their original release dates last year.
[6:18:21] Blackhaxx: if the CEO can get 200 mill they should have some LUL
[6:18:27] DoubleNova: blizz on that DoD budget LUL
[6:18:28] bruhSit_farmer: ive seen blizz dev meetings and how they work on southpark
[6:18:33] Phatlooter: LOL I hope the DOD is ready for anything. If Not China will love you for long time.
[6:18:34] ijuki: And I was saying it for years
[6:18:35] Nyvill: new world KEKW
[6:18:41] IlionDK: Communication is so much slower when you are not all in the same building
[6:18:44] Gizimoo86: cyberpunk was great Kappa
[6:19:00] ShadoodHD: i mean... gdi it's just a lot of technical difficulties for completing tasks... especially during a pandemic xD
[6:19:06] bruhSit_farmer: wc3 reforged
[6:19:08] bruhSit_farmer: oh wait
[6:19:14] aPorkpie: @ZyntosAran agreed , adhoc communication that's important to solutionising is just null and void over ms teams/zoom
[6:19:17] Longlastnamae: Look at it this way. There are plenty of games you never played that are good in the retro section :)
[6:19:18] MrGattz: hey cyberpunk could have been really good. just like SL could have been really good.
[6:19:19] cashaga: Due to tiktok debacle games are canceled in 2021
[6:19:37] Thoreya: just scrap SL like WoD and give us a fat 10.0
[6:19:40] Thoreya: it is what it is
[6:19:42] Thoreya: sucks but
[6:19:49] MrGattz: @Thoreya honestly, that might be what they are doing
[6:19:55] bruhSit_farmer: @Thoreya that'll hurt their overall player subs imo
[6:19:58] MrGattz: we'll never know
[6:19:59] Furyio: they can just chill on a new expac for a year, and let this roll out longer, its fine. Expansion is good, just has a bit of a drought at the moment
[6:20:00] bruhSit_farmer: alot wont come back
[6:20:02] TheUnknowing: they already pay them like shit so yeah they wont pay more lol
[6:20:06] club420: captain crunch
[6:20:08] lanara233: I just hope we actually get a 10.0
[6:20:11] Furyio: which is fine, there is other games to play, no game can fulfill you 24/7
[6:20:24] Nyvill: scrapping SL?
[6:20:28] DegenerateHaven: thats sad
[6:20:30] MrGattz: @MekChopperDiaries they have 11.0 in the works atm just being designed and imagined up
[6:20:34] ChosenRonin: just saying most companies already have duo push programs in place with vpns in place. they should have been ready. Cooperate espionage is super common i just find it hard to believe that they werent ready for remote in from home.
[6:20:40] wrec7: is 10.0 like the new expansion ?
[6:20:40] ZyntosAran: @porkpies yep, there were so many communication problems in our team, delaying projects etc. because people just dont talk to each other. Not to mention speed drops because people get destracted at home or Motivation loss due to the pandemic
[6:20:42] MrGattz: 10.0 we were suppose to see some crazy shit
[6:20:46] TheVigiliance: Blizzard, you are going down a path we cannot follow!
[6:20:47] MrGattz: idk if it will still happen
[6:20:48] stratiss: isn't 10.0 gonna be the revamp?
[6:20:50] bruhSit_farmer: so blizz release half expansions for full price
[6:20:51] Talason: why is tpwelliee always rolling solo
[6:20:57] bruhSit_farmer: thank god for tbc
[6:20:57] DoubleNova: Is 10.0 gonna be something special? Like Wow 2 or something
[6:21:03] TheBeastofCaerBannog: back corner
[6:21:07] StraightErro: below as well
[6:21:11] TheBeastofCaerBannog: down past Klak
[6:21:14] loa_it_fam: behind where he is stood
[6:21:15] Blackhaxx: 10.0 when ? LUL
[6:21:15] ClassicMalcontent: think also down yeah
[6:21:16] artoff01: once you jump and kill those toy go up and its near the wall on a stone
[6:21:17] MrGattz: there will never be a wow 2 but we might see a "new" engine
[6:21:20] TheBeastofCaerBannog: yep
[6:21:24] TheBeastofCaerBannog: back there to the right
[6:21:24] lithium364: man i really dont want them to pull another WoD skippintg content and shifting staff to next expansion already
[6:21:28] patlatzan: can we fire kotick ?
[6:21:29] TheBeastofCaerBannog: on the back wall
[6:21:30] Kaihrn: temming time
[6:21:31] MrGattz: not unreal engine style but somewhere inbetween
[6:21:34] balart: 10.0 i supposed to be the heroes going back to azeroth on a huge time travel
[6:21:38] DoubleNova: @MrGattz  yeah i kinda meant something like that I guess
[6:21:47] cashaga: WOW:VR Now swing at mobs and your roommates at the same time
[6:21:48] lanara233: @MrGattz you seem well informed
[6:21:58] Ahmad_Almansoori: LoL
[6:21:59] bruhSit_farmer: breaking news bobby kotick long time fan of wow franchise has donated 200m bonus to future wow development
[6:22:10] atmoszat: was wod really scrapped tho? wasnt it a full length expansion too?
[6:22:10] Longlastnamae: everything is fine. You have multiple escape routes :)
[6:22:34] MrGattz: @MekChopperDiaries hey we say towelliee knows for everything that happens.

[6:22:41] lithium364: 1 less then normal
[6:22:42] Maego1: 3
[6:22:44] CDubTheRIPper: hfc

[6:22:55] bruhSit_farmer: lol we will be lucky for 3 in sl
[6:22:56] bruhSit_farmer: wow
[6:22:56] balart: @Towelliee 1 less tier
[6:23:03] ShadoodHD: you'd have to consider it scrapped when the devs were working on a better one.... imo
[6:23:04] atmoszat: i see
[6:23:05] Supers18: shattrath got scrapped in wod
[6:23:05] lithium364: shattrath raid and farahlon endgame zone
[6:23:24] lithium364: which was crazy because farahlon existed during beta as a zone
[6:23:27] atmoszat: but it still had a long draught in the end right?
[6:23:29] aPorkpie: @ZyntosAran 100%, we've missed fully delivering at least an epic a quarter since March 19. People don't realise 80% of software dev is not actually writing code
[6:23:31] lithium364: you just couldnt go there
[6:23:43] bruhSit_farmer: staff weren't trained
[6:23:48] MrKhanes: It would be cool to see what WoD was going to be. To see that zone and that scrapped raid.
[6:23:49] Egzolinas: Blackrock Foundry was one of the coolest raid ever.
[6:23:54] DegenerateHaven: the 'bliizard way' Kappa
[6:23:59] ShadoodHD: which goes back to the main issue: communication NotLikeThis
[6:24:02] balart: @Towelliee so those all new workers started adjusting for legion and boom, great expansion
[6:24:05] Nyvill: farahlon Sadge
[6:24:14] Maego1: Theme was good, but potential not used to the best unfortunately:(
[6:24:25] ShadoodHD: "hey i need your help on this issue?" "okay what's the issue?" "come on over and i'll show you"
[6:24:27] dSaipher: Farahlon and Auchindon RIP
[6:24:27] 無職提督: thats typically man-manoth myth for tech company
[6:24:27] bruhSit_farmer: think we beat that downfall with sl right ??
[6:24:43] Kaihrn: Legion was brilliant fun
[6:24:43] horho112: m+ isnt content fk that shit
[6:24:47] 無職提督: more man isnt always helpful
[6:24:57] aPorkpie: How much can we use the statistics gathered by raiderio etc to determine player counts?
[6:25:03] NexusOps: "you think you do, but you don't" LUL
[6:25:06] KaisenSiru: The hit is perfect for me.
[6:25:09] Valzark: we dont know what we want
[6:25:12] digitoxity: hot take. i want corruption back
[6:25:12] horngano: Sadge dragon dead
[6:25:14] wrec7: yeah. I totally agree, need to find a middleground soemwhere
[6:25:18] bruhSit_farmer: fire them all and start over
[6:25:18] dSaipher: But shipyard Kappa
[6:25:18] Gunfluster: to be fair, players think they know what they want, but they dont 4Head
[6:25:20] ZyntosAran: @ShadoodHD "sends meet invite" - Here, let me share my screen. Do you see it? No? Ok, let me...  And hours wasted :D
[6:25:20] bruhSit_farmer: ez
[6:25:22] cashaga: My cow just wandered into a field of marijuana. The steaks have never been so high…
[6:25:25] Sandman_88: bad company managment
[6:25:40] piratechris: Could just be the wrong ppl making decisions on game direction at Blizzard
[6:25:43] Jay_rb: No KEKW
[6:25:44] ClassicMalcontent: Blizzard is like, "We think they want more store mounts (?) and micro-xactions?"
[6:25:46] ClassicMalcontent: Kappa
[6:25:46] Siechtum: atleast booby is happy
[6:25:47] Thoreya: ive said from the jump bfa was not that bad
[6:25:48] JokaThS: and infinite stars was fun
[6:25:48] TheVigiliance: I think tbc is going to be succesful, since SL is... yeah
[6:25:48] Hexof: probably miss the power it gives your character rather than the actual corruption system
[6:25:50] Kaihrn: we were lucky to get Legion tbh lmao
[6:25:50] club420: theres a lot of busy work in sl for anima, so if your a collector then you have a lot t do
[6:25:53] Balkidar: They know that we want TBC! SeemsGood
[6:25:54] Siechtum: bobby*
[6:25:59] ChosenRonin: @Towelliee are you or chat worried about the scaling in groups for outriders?
[6:26:07] MrGattz: i just cant imagine blizzard saying "yeah the players really want less loot! its crazy i know but we gotta give them what they want!"
[6:26:10] othraerir: who cares what the 1% want, you'll play anyway
[6:26:13] PopeJonas: I think they tried to make the loot more classic wow-ish but they butchered it.
[6:26:38] Jay_rb: Valor doesn't increase loot drops KEKW
[6:26:42] aPorkpie: If I wasn't raiding mythic I wouldn't play the game at all
[6:26:45] DeadShadowTV: valor did help
[6:26:47] atmoszat: less loot is fine but not _this much less_, they overdid it a bit
[6:26:47] cashaga: Whats your opinion of the Vault
[6:26:49] Hexof: they dun fucked up
[6:26:50] Mitune: I think things are just a bit too stagnant game design wise as well. Class design and combat needs a bigger overhaul in 10.0.
[6:26:52] Jay_rb: just make it the way it was before SL...
[6:26:57] CDubTheRIPper: im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!
[6:26:59] Frosin: casuals pay the bills, something learned 20 years ago
[6:27:02] Maego1: brin back bonus roll coins at least PraiseIt
[6:27:02] stratiss: the game needs a shake up tbh
[6:27:03] Thunderbrew: Shadowlands my go down as one of the most unpopular expansions.
[6:27:05] donpablo_98: towBleedpurple towClap
[6:27:06] Grandmarshal: Yeah, Blizzard fired hella employees and gave their CEO a 200 million dollar raise.

[6:27:24] Tharia: I was trying to figure out why classic is so much more enjoyable than SL when classic is such a pita
[6:27:26] piratechris: Well I know I canceled my sub and nothing in their roadmap makes me want to re-sub. Funny enough TBC could make me re-sub
[6:27:27] ShadoodHD: "No one expects the -- " nvm... you get the joke xD
[6:27:32] MrCojo1: @towelliee yeah if a casual has time to do 1 mythic plus and completes it with no gear drop... there is no reward for logging in
[6:27:39] donpablo_98: towCheer100
[6:27:41] CazualD: Blizzard just needs to hire a few average Joe’s who play the game to consult with game designers. Too many college grads with paper who can’t see beyond their own visions
[6:27:44] nadler6077: maybe  a good step for casuals would've been more world quests, flight masters whistle, better wq rewards etc? dunno tbh
[6:27:45] Waspire: its in the back on a rock
[6:27:45] Jay_rb: We need 3 pieces of loot from M+ at least and 5 drops from Mythic bosses :)
[6:27:46] TheBeastofCaerBannog: keep going it's on the back wall
[6:27:50] Weetang: i don't think blizz needs to do anything tbh - people will either play or they won't. can't please everyone.

[6:27:56] Balkidar: I still don’t understand why the old Valor point system and reforging was ever removed. BibleThump
[6:27:56] raldrik: just need to open up legion legacy so we can farm more as well. Thats alot more casual content

[6:27:59] Longlastnamae: They have fallen to the hiring methods of nepotism. And that is what you will continue to get.
[6:28:09] rambaldi00: I think the anima grind is the biggest issue. Too restrictive
[6:28:16] patlatzan: bobby kotick music plays in the background
[6:28:18] bolmaden: They should bring back old talent trees
[6:28:22] BlazeStomper: @Towelliee 70.53, 97.90
[6:28:26] zechetto: @towelliee I think the problem is casuals dont bother with repetitive content.   And Blizzard is not gonna invest the money to do real new content, II have no idea why
[6:28:28] nr147: Retail now is about homework you HAVE to do every week or else you fall behind. Classic and TBC classic is full of things to do outside of raiding which is a choice and fun in how you want to play. Turning all the players into super heroes was a huge mistake as well @towelliee
[6:28:31] Weetang: casuals don't like anything tbh
[6:28:38] krajar96: you still need lurkers
[6:28:40] Grandmarshal: The bag is on the back wall I believe
[6:28:44] othraerir: the bag is on a rock, near the big ramp i think
[6:28:44] Breakers__: Why don’t they repeat the past since it was so successful back then and just take pieces from then and imput it into “today’s” WoW?
[6:28:46] Chibs243: SL is the first time that wow isn’t installed on my pc since I started playing in TBC
[6:28:46] Bendjaova: were the highest sub numbers in wotlk or cata
[6:28:58] Hexof: what, classic is not full of things to do outside raiding. what are you smoking LUL
[6:29:00] cashaga: I ordered a chicken and an egg from Amazon. I'll let you know.
[6:29:09] Tharia: agreed @nr147
[6:29:23] Nebulizer87: saying classic and TBC have things outside of raiding xD
[6:29:29] idenkaz_: SL is evidence that you dont fuck with your casual playbase, ever. hope people get that now and take them for full instead of bashing casuals lmao
[6:29:36] horho112: when is prepatch coming i wanna lvl prot belf
[6:29:47] Balkidar: You are also a much better player now
[6:29:49] CazualD: @weetang you couldn’t be more wrong
[6:29:55] goodmonson1: is the quest progress text supposed to be red?
[6:29:56] MadBomberXX: classic mythics lol
[6:29:57] Jermo11: i really wanted to enjoy SL but it was too painful to play after a few weeks
[6:30:02] Kaihrn: Legion was Bis
[6:30:03] Gorestack: Artifact weapon talent trees were superb
[6:30:05] beckett3a: once they fixed the lego droprate legion was top 3 expacs
[6:30:06] Longlastnamae: I remember a lot of TBC being harder. And I'm not even on my Main. I'm doing the same with the 58 poopy gear. Still isn't hard
[6:30:07] DegenerateHaven: mythic + was a big deal
[6:30:09] Tharia: felt rwarding
[6:30:12] Beri38: Legion was really succesful and much less alt friendly than sl
[6:30:14] atmoszat: and world quests were also new
[6:30:15] iunbearable: You’re more educated now and how to play the game properly. We were kids back then.
[6:30:15] Tharia: SL doesn't
[6:30:19] DoubleNova: that was the best system they ever did
[6:30:26] Grum1610: Love SL it’s really good but it got so boring..
[6:30:35] nadler6077: mage tower was the goat
[6:30:38] ZyntosAran: i liked the beginning of shadowlands. But now its just boring, so I just run some alts
[6:30:39] Henke1983: hated the artifact wepon
[6:30:48] Henke1983: weapon*
[6:30:48] biigbass: Being able to identify someone's achievements based on their artifact appearance was pretty cool
[6:30:50] cashaga: i think im only like 14 in my covenants lol
[6:30:56] Tharia: mage tower was fun but tbh I left it until it was going away
[6:30:58] laughing_octopus: damn lay on hands 1hr cd xD
[6:31:01] Naithos_: BFA felt like they tried to re-use the really good Legion mechanics, but downgraded them in every way. Mission table, artifact, everything
[6:31:05] josh8555: loved the artifact weapons
[6:31:06] ShadoodHD: the artifact was okay.. you just didn't need to go back and put all the damn points like SL is doing with anima NotLikeThis
[6:31:07] othraerir: at least the artifact wep gave you something to do
[6:31:08] ZyntosAran: artifact weapon was one of the best features wow ever had imho
[6:31:13] Elswango: i didn't really like how you upped the ilvl on the weapon
[6:31:15] Hexof: I still think the mage tower should of been completed with "template/premade" gear sets
[6:31:16] Kaihrn: yeh that was a kick in the balz
[6:31:23] Heekss: The middle of legion was great, start a bit meh, same with the end.
[6:31:32] niceteis: we want less loot, but it has to be way better designed, like somthing u remember the name of, like dft, or gressil
[6:31:33] josh8555: yea the sword bullshit
[6:31:35] Nebulizer87: legion was by far my fav xpac, the grind and everyday contributions to player power was my jam
[6:31:35] KaisenSiru: And what would you have done?
[6:31:36] Reinkaos999: legion was awesome, from the zones to story to systems, not much weakness in my opinion
[6:31:49] Waspire: artifact  weapon was  awesome!
[6:31:49] CDubTheRIPper: theyll probably bring back that system next expac
[6:31:50] Baron_Pandacula: the only problem was the uncapped ap farm, but the artifacts were cool
[6:31:53] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: HAO ?! LUL
[6:31:58] wrec7: i loved the artifact weapon, Legion was prob the most i played since TBC
[6:32:07] Broomba: keep going the way are you are facing around the bend
[6:32:11] doomester: @Towelliee legion is one of the best, really?
[6:32:13] lithium364: i member survival hunter getting buffed by 500% baseline dmg during emeral nightmare LUL
[6:32:15] Tharia: nighthold is my favorite raid
[6:32:15] PopeJonas: I didnt mind the legendaries. The fact that they could drop everywhere made me want to do everything
[6:32:18] ClassicMalcontent: I enjoyed Legion all the way through TBH
[6:32:23] Chibs243: Blizz gave us 200,000,000 reasons to unsub just a few weeks back
[6:32:23] ChosenRonin: @Towelliee i quit legion like 3 weeks in i kinda wish i stayed with it because of how it ended
[6:32:26] Tharia: suramar is an awesome zone
[6:32:29] TheVigiliance: Emerald Nightmare LUL
[6:32:46] Hexof: Legion was my fave expansion since wotlk
[6:32:47] TheUnknowing: I think shadowlands can be the same way as long as they get every one back in the office, i hope they can salvage it atleast
[6:32:47] CDubTheRIPper: talking about legion, i just saw a clip of you getting a lego from a bot4000 LUL
[6:32:48] Jzstyles: SAME
[6:32:50] Nebulizer87: suramar dunks on maw
[6:32:52] GrizzlyBaffert: @Tharia hahaha Ogosh
[6:32:57] Tharia: lol
[6:32:59] beckett3a: man i wish we;ll get mop classic
[6:32:59] Bendjaova: wotlk
[6:33:00] stjon13: I's be fine w/ NO systems just dungs /raids/storyline content
[6:33:02] Katzushirou: MoP DansGame
[6:33:02] atmoszat: @Kingsperg yeeess. and also there were stuff to do. imagine farming SL wq-s for legendaries
[6:33:02] piratechris: TBC, Wrath and Legion my top 3 expansions
[6:33:05] MrKhanes: yeah Suramar was amazing
[6:33:07] WapiMowin: WapiMowin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! happy saturday
[6:33:08] beckett3a: really wanna raid ToT and SoO
[6:33:09] Jzstyles: I totally shat on mop at the start but it was amazing
[6:33:14] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[6:33:15] love_eggplant: what expansion are you most excited for getting classic version?
[6:33:16] Jay_rb: What
[6:33:17] Jermo11: yeah m+ and world quests was new but now theyre just the same shit
[6:33:20] Broomba: would u put bfa behind mop @towelliee
[6:33:23] stratiss: That's a strange order, those gameplay loops are completely different.
[6:33:23] azzurrin: Legion is my favorite xpac
[6:33:23] Jermo11: in legion
[6:33:34] traineept: Idk, I must be rare at this point. But I honestly loved all the expansions so far. Sure I have favorite expansions, but I still very much loved them all. lol
[6:33:35] Broomba: wraith babies

[6:33:37] Tharia: it felt dandergous and not because I couldn't mount :rolls eyes: maw hoped to be like suramar lol but just fell short
[6:33:39] nadler6077: legion is also my favorite xpac
[6:33:51] cashaga: imagine being the ceo of blizzard, all the peons crying below your tower but you cant hear them cause your 2m feet above em
[6:33:52] Grandmarshal: Wrath gave birth to "Wrath babies" remember that @towelliee
[6:33:53] MrKhanes: I think my top 3 would be Mop, TBC and Legion. Just because how fun i had in thoose 3 expansion
[6:33:57] iunbearable: ICC, Legion, Shadowlands FortOne
[6:34:06] Dylan19_93: wotlk <3
[6:34:17] bolmaden: wrath was my favorite, but most because of i had a great time with friends
[6:34:17] Zeakon92: bfa 4/10  , shadowlands 5/
[6:34:20] Zeakon92: ish
[6:34:21] ShadoodHD: "Oh boi Arthas comes back! Time to play!!!"
[6:34:22] love_eggplant: i found draenor really fun, dont kill me
[6:34:23] Bendjaova: wotlk then legion imo
[6:34:23] MuttonChopins: which expansion is at the bottom of your list?
[6:34:30] goodmonson1: I hope for some good changes for wotlk classic tho
[6:34:33] Bendjaova: wod is worstr
[6:34:35] cashaga: one of the best wow experiences was killing lich king, rest was trash
[6:34:36] ShadoodHD: says every wrath baby
[6:34:37] Heekss: SL is actually the worst tbh, wod was better
[6:34:38] LogBro: how long do you think it will take a decent leveler to go from 60-70.
[6:34:40] biigbass: droughts never feel good D:
[6:34:47] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee BFA had its problems, but overall not a bad expansion, not as bad as Draenor
[6:34:48] Kromede: idk SELFIE was a highlight
[6:34:49] Tharia: think MOP is my second favorite though when it was current I wasn't liking it much
[6:34:50] DoubleNova: significant things can still come later in the patch cycles right?
[6:34:51] Thunderbrew: Drought is now it seems
[6:34:52] Jenoseph: Well i am now done with shadowlands got my KSM an ahead of the curve so boring now guess i am going to stick with star trek till i find something in wow to do
[6:34:55] Sacredspir1t: TBC, wrath, legion, SL
[6:34:59] Zeakon92: yes, current state
[6:35:00] Waspire: id still give them a 10 for effort in SL
[6:35:02] Zeakon92: naa
[6:35:11] ShadoodHD: S KEKW L F I E
[6:35:11] MuttonChopins: SL has a bad start, WoD had a good start
[6:35:11] Hexof: BFA was chores
[6:35:15] biigbass: Truuuuue
[6:35:16] Chibs243: The drought is now
[6:35:19] ClassicMalcontent: I stopped playing WoW in BFA. It ended retail for me personally.
[6:35:25] Tharia: LUL agreed. I couldn't raid in Uldir and then that was that
[6:35:28] Jay_rb: Factual
[6:35:35] Maego1: i left at the end of Uldir and came back on 8.3 .. i was confused af first week LUL
[6:35:35] Nutsy: @Tharia That just means that everything that came afterwards was so bad that MoP looks good compared to shit.
[6:35:41] MaX_DutchyW: i need to facking clear mechagon shit after i came back that was horrible
[6:35:45] bolmaden: all i did in BFA was farming mounts LUL
[6:35:45] Hank_ish: sucked
[6:35:47] Tharia: yes LUL @Nutsy
[6:35:53] Zeakon92: 10=%
[6:35:54] atamdev: lol thats probably why i hated bfa so much. i had to sit out 8.2 and coming back was very unpleasant
[6:35:57] idenkaz_: looking back i´d take alot of shit back i said about bfa.
[6:36:00] Woaxx: I can't believe all the hate bfa got it good at keeping your intrigued
[6:36:02] Jokervenom1978: I loved 8.2
[6:36:04] Mitune: Sl might need to add catch-up raids which would have potentially helped Bfa
[6:36:05] CazualD: It was.. but I did it lol
[6:36:08] eggo992: That’s exactly what happened to me
[6:36:08] Nebulizer87: corruption was bad but my god it was the wild west for a few weeks and a lot of funny crazy shit happened with that system
[6:36:11] Heekss: 8.2 was acually good
[6:36:13] metavahn231: BFA will forever be that 6/10 expansion
[6:36:14] Zeakon92: the later bfa was good, but the first half was dog shit
[6:36:28] stjon13: but the raids are always atleast good
[6:36:31] love_eggplant: corruptions werent good at all
[6:36:32] barrog420: Iam weird but for me real WoW ended with Wotlk.
[6:36:32] Hank_ish: 8.2 was good
[6:36:32] TheTrueHellkite: As a semi casual player Shadowlands is the first xpac i didnt purchase. The borrowed power stuff is such a turn off.
[6:36:34] stratiss: 8.2 saved BFA
[6:36:35] Heekss: Nazjatar was good
[6:36:35] KaisenSiru: and I prefer not losing out.
[6:36:37] Coox69: the mechagon/nazjatar rep grind uhhh
[6:36:39] Beri38: I don't believe it's a "drought" if you play the shit out of a game for 2 months and THEN have nothing to do. Which btw you probably do, but yu don't want to which is more than fair
[6:36:50] Hexof: Nzoth felt really rushed, could of been an expansion his self sadly
[6:36:54] Marmoh: Mechagon dungeon is one of the best instanced content in the game @Towelliee
[6:37:17] Sandisy: systems overload. punishment for not playing the entire time
[6:37:20] bruhSit_farmer: that cinematic was dope though
[6:37:21] MuttonChopins: mechagon was pretty cool imo
[6:37:23] Baldee: that LOTR ending was cringe af
[6:37:24] Zeakon92: @elixirfield1  you think so, not me xd  i´d still say bfa is a 4/10 cuz the expac itself on a entirety was real mediocre.
[6:37:26] Nutsy: Kill his tentecle dicks LOL
[6:37:33] sk8status85: Zug Zug
[6:37:34] Nyvill: i mean finally "Beating" sargeras the prime evil wasnt any better
[6:37:35] ShadoodHD: "Champion!" Kappa

[6:37:37] Jokervenom1978: I dont think NZoth is gone.
[6:37:39] Tharia: Naz and Mechagon were cool, agreed
[6:37:40] Weetang: personally i feel that it's fine if people leave and fall behind. there is a reward for sticking with the game and investing time.
[6:37:41] MuttonChopins: werent people saying the cinematic was pretty bad
[6:37:42] Maego1: it was all only a vision and we will come back to the old god corrupted azeroth Kappa
[6:37:46] bruhSit_farmer: bellular says hes still alive and actually behind whats going on now
[6:37:48] NexusOps: as you said; I was so lost when coming back to 8.3 after skipping 8.2, I had no idea what was going on. Benthic gear or whatever that was, doing all the zones. etc
[6:37:53] Zeakon92: Yes naz and mecha was a cool thing
[6:37:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:37:55] Jermo11: that lotr ending LUL
[6:37:58] TweakT: bfa KEKW
[6:37:58] Smileh_TV: Quick, stop talking about BFA or Magni will come talking about Azerite.
[6:37:59] Tharia: never did visions much thnk my cloak was 6 and then I was out
[6:38:01] tripl3heart: innovate the legion artifact gear together with perfecting the azurite bugs and they could have something real good for the future without having problems with gear etc
[6:38:01] Ertra: at least there weren't fireworks when BFA ended
[6:38:04] billybaroo1: do u have any beta keys?
[6:38:05] bolmaden: might wanna update your profil info " Don't miss World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion Launch Party Nov 23rd 3PST" @Towelliee LUL
[6:38:10] Zeakon92: no more shit bfa plz
[6:38:12] bruhSit_farmer: I LOVED bfa zones
[6:38:12] Hexof: what expansion doesnt have issues LUL
[6:38:15] TweakT: BFA is a 2/10 expansion at best
[6:38:18] Maego1: CHAMPION POGGERS
[6:38:23] bruhSit_farmer: SL is a 1.5/10
[6:38:29] bruhSit_farmer: imo
[6:38:35] ncsu_riggs: @Towelliee you enjoying how much of a grind it is to level?
[6:38:40] Yanzoh: tf lol
[6:38:42] JokaThS: i would say nyalotha was one of the most wanted zones from ppl that love lore and they made it a raid @Towelliee
[6:38:44] bruhSit_farmer: yep lol
[6:38:46] Mitune: seems to be a common thing with Blizzard and their systems coxClown
[6:38:49] NexusOps: I liked the start of BFA with the stories in each zone. rooShrug
[6:38:59] Balkidar: Unpopular opinion. 8.1 was my favorite part of BFA. I was literally doing M+ on 10 characters. I had issues lol
[6:39:02] Vanhoek: @Towelliee Honestly if they would of just carried on with our artifact weapons into BFA tied the essence powers to the artifact. kept Teir sets BFA would of been the best expansion since Wrath.
[6:39:03] Beri38: Yeah BfA leveling was good, at least for horde
[6:39:05] eggo992: What about the pvp scaling in bfa
[6:39:05] felblazes: I got my boot off today, wooooooooooo!
[6:39:07] lithium364: im rating it very low right now just because my casual raiding guild fully quit already
[6:39:10] ChosenRonin: for me i just have a problem with the way blizzard tells stories they seem very disconnected imo
[6:39:18] billybaroo1: the .5 is because you get to dance in the first raid Kappa
[6:39:19] bruhSit_farmer: ally bfa zones some of my favourite ever
[6:39:23] Sonatta: and they knew from beta that Azerite gear wasn't working... i think that's the worst part about BFA and Azerite gear
[6:39:27] lastdeviljoker666: with rank 1 abilities lol
[6:39:28] Yanzoh: pvp was garbage in bfa, corruption x9000 and gg lol
[6:39:29] cashaga: i really cant argue that player base expectations are too high because its a subscription based game so the player base should demand a certain level of content, im just wondering how much blizzard will give to the player base now that covid is a thing and money is issue and ceos > employees
[6:39:32] Thunderbrew: I'm a super casual player. Shadowlands is missing something. I don't want to do M+, I don't like the Vault. I'm not good enough to do PvP. I complete the raid on normal. I'm playing Classic now.
[6:39:37] Elswango: i heard tbc beta has the classic xp model still
[6:39:41] Tharia: and changing /removing crap that didn't need to be changed/removed
[6:39:53] JonnasINF: @lithium364 Most of my guild have quit too, not enough to raid any more

[6:40:18] bruhSit_farmer: yea 2 guilds of mine disbanded in SL thus far
[6:40:23] Yanzoh: imagine quitting WoW over pve content lol
[6:40:27] iEnjoyHouse: will TBC coming soon ?

[6:41:28] hefestas: whats the star trek ship in the top left?
[6:41:29] ClassicMalcontent: Boosting in classic (classic, TBC classic and/if/when WotLK classic) is a bad idea. It actually makes botting MORE profitable.
[6:41:30] Zeakon92: haha true
[6:41:31] Erazor449: Erazor449 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hi from Germany! :P
[6:41:32] Mission_plausible: @Towelliee  Dont you agree it will make the botting issue worse ?
[6:41:37] Zeakon92: almooost
[6:41:38] FizlerJC: FizlerJC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[6:41:48] thorwann: If a level boost allows me to skip the content i dislike to do the content that I like, then it is all good, I shouldn't have to suffer through vanilla content just to get to the TBC stuff, which I know I like.
[6:41:48] ClassicMalcontent: Boosting actually boosts botting.
[6:41:52] xaragorn078: i stay on shadowland i dont agree if you dont like it bur every one play what they want
[6:41:52] biigbass: Truuuue
[6:42:09] Nyvill: buy boost for a 58 rogue bot BRD for 500g/day 😃
[6:42:10] TweakT: when is pre-patch?
[6:42:12] Maego1: Imo botters would just boost they other botters wouldnt they?
[6:42:18] WeedIsMySin__: I assume Classic expansions are free?
[6:42:28] ZyntosAran: @WeedIsMySin1 yes
[6:42:33] Zeakon92: yes ofc
[6:42:33] ClassicMalcontent: Watch The Ballad of the Level Boost by MadSeasonShow on YouTube. He makes good points on why Boosting is a bad idea.
[6:42:37] love_eggplant: no u need to buy a sub
[6:42:45] Dylan19_93: How will the boosting work?
[6:42:50] tripl3heart: u need around 10k to be comfy i think
[6:42:51] Zeakon92: have seen it classicMalcontent
[6:42:54] silodin: i'll just wait for wow tokens 😃
[6:43:02] graysprings: levelling an alt now for tbc
[6:43:04] emperormingg: Towelliee have you watched madseasons video on the level boost? I thought the same as you and it changed my mind
[6:43:05] Yanzoh: you buy a boost your chsr gets lv 60 @dylan19_93
[6:43:11] jeeslouise: Just go pure stam towel
[6:43:22] thorwann: spell damage
[6:43:24] ClassicMalcontent: @Maego1 level boost actually makes it faster for botters to reach profitability with a bot. Much faster.
[6:43:24] biigbass: I believe it is spell power
[6:43:27] Dustinbrowning: I miss sockets so much. These sockets mattered so much lol
[6:43:29] ZyntosAran: @Yanzoh 58 i think
[6:43:31] biigbass: SP
[6:43:32] Spitviper51: Cheer100  Im not much of a classic fan. However, Tbc and wrath, I will dedicate my LIFE TO. so i am a okay with the boost
[6:43:34] Zeakon92: gear
[6:43:34] Nyvill: wotlk is spellpower
[6:43:40] flowrez4k: @Towelliee Spellpower is WOTLK
[6:43:46] Bendjaova: from the best xpac
[6:43:49] barrog420: wotlk is SP. TBC is spell damage
[6:43:51] Zeakon92: wotlk changed the name
[6:43:53] Yanzoh: @zyntosaran yes 58! lol
[6:43:58] Yanzoh: ty
[6:44:10] Walshey: weapons have spellpower enchants in classic no?
[6:44:15] othraerir: use retail gold to buy a boost :)
[6:44:26] ClassicMalcontent: When they ban bots, boosts give a way for a new account to get instant-profit.
[6:44:47] ClassicMalcontent: Right now banning bots actually hurts. It takes time to re-level and cuts profits  dampers it.
[6:44:50] Yanzoh: ugh being a uni student sucks, I have to wait to sub, well I have to work for everything on school budget:( lmao will sub again soon brotha!
[6:45:12] cashaga: Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
[6:45:21] ShadoodHD: some just wants to see the world (of warcraft) burn.... Kappa
[6:45:22] stratiss: if they account gets banned for botting, it's easier to recreate a bottable character
[6:45:23] Yanzoh: yuppers
[6:45:24] Zeakon92: true
[6:45:28] Zeakon92: so it will be "cheaper"
[6:45:32] TweakT: because illegal companees are illegal
[6:45:33] tripl3heart: its not 30 bucks tho xD
[6:45:37] moa285: 1xmage 1xrogue 1x warrior, keep warr at classic and buy boost for warrior on tbc
[6:45:39] Elswango: bot accounts are all based in countries where the prices are less than US
[6:45:41] emperormingg: there is a different between fixing the issues and just getting people to pay you to avoid the problems
[6:45:42] Longlastnamae: Why buy an account, get a friend who quit
[6:45:43] slaughteredpig: do you vape DTL?

[6:45:59] ShadoodHD: and get tagged with phishing/bait mails? no thanks
[6:45:59] TweakT: idk man I'm not a botter
[6:45:59] Yanzoh: LOL so true, like its already happening
[6:46:17] othraerir: #somechanges: do you think they should stack potions etc to 20? your bags are pretty full :)
[6:46:19] Broomba: @towelliee what server or is the name where your hammer squad guild is located in star trek mobile?
[6:46:30] ClassicMalcontent: If someone needs a boost why play the game? In other words they should BAN boosters and bots constantly.
[6:46:33] Neowanderer: wassup with the gametime changes, seems un-needed
[6:46:34] cashaga: ZBots flooding the market making shit load of in game gold to re sell for irl cash
[6:46:35] Shenun: the thing is  theys want to profit from it  and not fix the problem
[6:46:36] Kaihrn: those sites have always been there since the start of wow lmao

[6:46:57] DoubleNova: blinded by the light
[6:46:57] bruhSit_farmer: the concern is over monetization of classic i think

[6:47:17] CCNoblesse: @alsorrr oh lol you are adorable... free boost
[6:47:18] ClassicMalcontent: @alsorrr talking if a bot account is banned they buy a new one but not all pay USD
[6:47:25] Masterless: no shot its free they trying to make money off classic
[6:47:26] hefestas: whats the star trek thing?
[6:47:26] traineept: And you really think its only the bots that are accumulating and will decimate the economy? Players are worse most of the time. --'
[6:47:27] Waspire: its not blind.... its a  tunnel vision.
[6:47:27] Yanzoh: LMFAO
[6:47:29] piratechris: Players in shadowlands gonna be like lost in the Sahara desert looking for an oasis without other players cause everyone is playing TBC
[6:47:32] Drogdorf: free KEKW
[6:47:33] Chad_Chonker: LUL
[6:47:34] GOD_NAT: How much is the boost?
[6:47:34] Naithos_: @alsorrr Not in TBC. You will have one paid boost per account
[6:47:39] Aedarax: Bobby needs a yacht KEKW
[6:47:43] AureliusXV: who cares about bots its only a classic server its not real
[6:47:43] stjon13: they need to do "surprise" all gold to "0" at BC launch
[6:47:45] TweakT: boost is unethical.  Creates a divide between peepo who can afford to buy a lvl 58 and those who dont, any majority of peepo wont buy a boost for 60 euros
[6:47:47] Neowanderer: free and activision in the same sentance ya never gonna happen
[6:47:49] alsorrr: ok i was mistaken then
[6:47:52] PapaJohnz23: boost is 1 per account ?
[6:47:54] Spitviper51: Cheer1000 Cheer1000  Can I just say, I love your commentary. I always turn you up and listen to you as I play and it  always makes me glad I tuned in, keep it up man
[6:47:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:48:00] graysprings: 60usd
[6:48:02] idenkaz_: BC starter kit Kappa
[6:48:11] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[6:48:17] emperormingg: well its obvious, levelling a character from 0-60 requires time and gives opportunity for the bot to be banned because its in the open world where other people are. With the boost it takes players out of the world, straight into outland and a newly boosted character can go straight into printing gold
[6:48:19] Zeakon92: already been confirmed basicly *  except the cost of it
[6:48:19] atamdev: It's not free, and i dont think its because theyre being greedy. It creates a barrier to entry for people creating new accounts to bot
[6:48:20] PsychoWarren: LUL
[6:48:21] on_sale_menswear: Bring back recruit a friend for pre-patch, let people level with friends, no boosts.
[6:48:23] Ursiel: imagine buying a boost just to quit when you realize you have to do attunements.
[6:48:31] TweakT: money for power in game has no place in a quality game
[6:48:41] graysprings: esfandHowdy_BW esfandHowdy_BW
[6:48:42] ClassicMalcontent: Bots are bad. Boosts are also bad as they enable boosters to get bots to profitability much faster. Ban bots. No boosts.
[6:48:44] Zeakon92: @Ursiel  ahahaha xD yeah cacual ppl
[6:48:49] Dustinbrowning: I don’t even know what to boost because I have to hand level a B elf
[6:49:01] einself111: just do the math lol
[6:49:03] cashaga: the problem is boost or no boosts bots are here to stay forever
[6:49:03] graysprings: WHAT HAPPENED TO JUST PLAYING THE GAME LOL
[6:49:08] on_sale_menswear: Because more is better?
[6:49:10] Spitviper51: Cheer5000  What? 2k was the most? okay how about 5
[6:49:10] Whoracle1337: boost costs more money than someone leveling manually
[6:49:13] Whoracle1337: why would they buy it
[6:49:15] katzachiel: used to leave messing about with these fel reavers around here
[6:49:17] einself111: they need no gear for brd
[6:49:26] othraerir: !!!
[6:49:27] Ursiel: why play the game when i can give bobby more money
[6:49:33] stratiss: If the botted account gets banned, it become infinitely easier to replace that account.
[6:49:36] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: do the meth Kappa

[6:50:05] ClassicMalcontent: "The Ballad of the Level Boost" | MadSeasonShow changed my mind. I was for boosts until I considered his arguments. It was that good.
[6:50:08] lanara233: Saying boosts aren't a problem because the game's already full of bots is like saying it's ok to kill someone because we're all going to die anyway
[6:50:11] Erazor449: Doubble Shield ftw
[6:50:16] othraerir: hell no
[6:50:17] idenkaz_: oh hell no

[6:50:25] Spitviper51: @Whoracle1337  Thanks fam =D
[6:50:26] ClassicMalcontent: Its not how many accounts they have they all need to be banned.
[6:50:29] GOD_NAT: what is a botter?
[6:50:29] AureliusXV: people that have been playing private servers are goign to steam roll this shit its not going to be funny
[6:50:31] TheUnknowing: botters and bot companies that sell the gold and shit, have TONS of accounts
[6:50:33] cashaga: the have 1000's upon 1000's
[6:50:33] Mitune: also botters arent buying boost from blizzard they are buying it from other botters
[6:50:36] Archjin: Cheer100 @Towelliee Hey man, if you remove racials, which faction would you prefer for TBC Classic?
[6:50:36] on_sale_menswear: No, so they're going to make infinitely more and buy boosts to.
[6:50:43] josh8555: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHype towHype
[6:50:45] Naithos_: @Whoracle1337 The argument as I understand it, is that if a botter buys a boost, they can go straight to farming more profitable stuff, meaning they earn more gold faster, meaning there's more gold to sell. So they earn back the money spent on the boost, and more
[6:50:50] stratiss: No, but it still make it easier to create new accounts.
[6:50:50] TweakT: tegrity farms
[6:50:53] ClassicMalcontent: "Lots of accounts" means ban "Lots of accounts" for botters.
[6:50:53] cashaga: they stole so many accounts in data breaches
[6:50:55] TweakT: tegrity farm remembers
[6:50:57] laughing_octopus: guys there is so many bots at 60 right now in classic IT IS INSANE
[6:50:57] Kaihrn: they have like TEN accounts at least lmao
[6:51:13] goodmonson1: integrity bad >:(
[6:51:14] Longlastnamae: Have people never seen someone using 180 accounts at once. Where there is a nerd, there is a way
[6:51:17] emperormingg: just because a problem is big doesn't mean you shouldn't bother trying to actually fix it
[6:51:18] Lamp680: This is not a topic ppl will change their minds on. I am all in for the one boost.
[6:51:26] cashaga: ive recovered my account before and logged in no gold all items sold and naked before
[6:51:37] Joryckfree: Yea thats why the boost is not good they have 10 accounts and they will recieve 10x 58 for "free"
[6:51:38] Mitune: They have 10 accounts all going at the same time. 1 of those accounts in probably leveling just in case LUL
[6:51:46] Naithos_: Personally though I'm good with the boost. I'll probably use it myself
[6:52:02] ClassicMalcontent: @Lamp680 "The Ballad of the Level Boost" | MadSeasonShow changed my mind.
[6:52:13] ClassicMalcontent: @Lamp680 I was all for the level boost.
[6:52:14] Ursiel: tfw people who didn't want retail get mad when classic goes more like retail. esfandBruh fucking classic andys
[6:52:16] beckett3a: yeah boost is set in stone
[6:52:19] balart: @Towelliee thanks to the boost I'm playing with alliance friends so fuck it
[6:52:20] mackanron: If blizzard is constatnly banning them im ok with it. they get alot of money from it and it will keep the game alive. the boost is what makes atleast 3 of my friends try tbc..
[6:52:21] Ripxuzi: !out
[6:52:25] TheVigiliance: How long of a pre-patch do you think we will get?
[6:52:27] Fraple: isn't it only one boost per account anyway?
[6:52:33] Joryckfree: Yea Madseason´s is really hard to argue with I recommend to watch it
[6:52:34] cashaga: family friendly game means that grandma wants to play tbc with the rest of family not start over at 1
[6:52:35] laughing_octopus: the boost is useless without a token xD
[6:52:36] Joneeeez: when do you believe we will get an announcement date for tbc classic

[6:52:43] WeedIsMySin__: Can new players boost aswell?
[6:52:44] Dylan19_93: ~People who say they dont want boosts are literally asking a (somewhat struggling) company to remove something that will make them money (not something new, a exsisting automated service they have already) lol
[6:52:48] ClassicMalcontent: @Fraple yes. Not the point. New account gets one. Botterr insta-profit level
[6:52:52] Ursiel: it's one boost per account* *for now
[6:52:53] balart: @Towelliee why are the taurens in terokkar so small
[6:52:54] Spitviper51: If anything, itll bring people who dont wanna make the 1-60 grind, adding more population
[6:53:13] emperormingg: yes because people making money off of botting will not want to increase their profit easily lol
[6:53:15] Elswango: venezuelan account and get that shit for 10 bucks
[6:53:16] sk8status85: what classic server is he on?
[6:53:16] ClassicMalcontent: It's insta-profit level per-account including new ones if the botter accounts get banned
[6:53:23] Xehanort1986: Only the outpost to the south east
[6:53:30] Mission_plausible: @Towelliee  The reason alot of people play classic. Is because current wow is so heavily monetized. And the Boost is a step in that direction.
[6:53:33] implyingmonkey: as a father of two im very glad we're getting a boost
[6:53:37] wrec7: its not 600$ tho they can use the credit card trick to think your from argentina or whatever so its like 6$ per month sub and boost is like 25

[6:53:43] ClassicMalcontent: @mission_plausible that's a point as well
[6:53:46] emperormingg: famously people doing illegal shit are not greedy lol
[6:53:46] laughing_octopus: i highly advice anyone who wants to play tbc to start leveling right now its way better than the boost
[6:53:53] cashaga: i mean people do stupid shit in this game already like the guy who multi boxed 150 accounts
[6:53:55] pavepawns: should go full monetization for tbc
[6:53:59] anacronz: drums fix Kappa
[6:54:15] MaxironAres: boost will be nice if you wanted to change to a different race
[6:54:16] feelswyzman: bosses gonna get cleared in 1 day anyway
[6:54:18] TweakT: gotta accustom the sheep to paying for microtransactions
[6:54:18] cedemusic: i have no interest in playing vanilla or BC, but because i started in late BC and played the hell out of Wrath, u bet i'll buy a boost to play Wrath Classic
[6:54:19] CCNoblesse: botting will be even a bigger issue when botters can start making gold straight away instead of having to waste 10-15-20 days to level a char. Boost are just going to ruin the economy of the game, but Blizzard will make a lot of money from all the bots they ban and that's the whole idea behind this.
[6:54:23] Ursiel: can they remove the lw requirement from drums. that'd be nice
[6:54:23] Vanhoek: @Towelliee Its like I say the boosts are hardly the issue here and why people are being blinded by it is silly. If they are worried about the classic world being "empty" or the economy borked. Boycott the boosting community, boycott the GDKP's which is what cause the market inflation more then anything and force blizzard to bring in better bot control sweeps
[6:54:23] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee should be one more base south/south east of you
[6:54:24] Spitviper51: @Ursiel
[6:54:28] alsorrr: what if they will announce that TBC is the new retail now and then go different road after TBC payoPog
[6:54:31] MuttonChopins: wouldnt pre-nerf classic still be the same?
[6:54:36] Spitviper51: But if even a fraction of them stick it out youll; end up with more players
[6:54:42] emperormingg: LEVELLING IS FUN DAMN LATEGAME ANDYS
[6:54:45] anacronz: they gonna add fly soon man
[6:54:47] Waspire: towBleedpurple
[6:54:48] Mission_plausible: @Towelliee  The reason alot of people play classic. Is because current wow is so heavily monetized. And the Boost is a step in that direction.
[6:54:54] Shrenko: look dad a flying LIZARD !!!!!
[6:54:56] ClassicMalcontent: I am FINE with a new TBC Classic Collectors edition. And services like Faction Change or Race Change or Realm Change. Those are all fine.
[6:54:57] cashaga: the next xpac is gonna be pre classic
[6:55:01] Mitune: flying is 60% speed for basic isnt it? @Towelliee
[6:55:13] AureliusXV: boost boost boost
[6:55:14] cashaga: lvl 30 max no mounts, sticks and rocks
[6:55:14] Walshey: I think the ground mount will be for retail, no way they bring it out for tbc
[6:55:17] Masterless: the mounts kinda sick if they keep it cosmetic i really dont care
[6:55:39] Joryckfree: dont get me wrong I m for some changes but not for the boost  really guys try watching madseason video
[6:55:41] daegoh: @Towelliee  do you think the mount will be 100% speed?
[6:55:56] ClassicMalcontent: *but* when you introduct in-game store items, mounts, etc and level boosts and tokens. Now, you're in retail mode.
[6:56:06] graysprings: Falcorn esfandHowdy_BW
[6:56:06] TheUnknowing: People just like to bitch about stuff that really doesn't impact them in any way
[6:56:06] anacronz: w8 they add faction change in classic?
[6:56:12] cashaga: Ashes of Alar Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:56:22] MuttonChopins: I like madseason but he sounds more like he is mad at the boosting than actually making points @Joryckfree
[6:56:27] Masterless: well factions change really kills alliance imo ppl are so min max in classic
[6:56:29] Mitune: The thing about the boost is that the botters are not buying the boost from blizzard. Its a non bot issue. Botters if they even buy a boost will buy it from other botters for much less \
[6:56:29] alsorrr: i agree with that mindset. I'm pretty sure that whatever blizzard will to - i will enjoy TBC shit ton
[6:56:30] pavepawns: @Joryckfree dont say rly guys watch the vid. multiple ppl watched and still want boosts
[6:56:35] TweakT: EU is gonna blacklist boosteds systematically
[6:56:41] LeSteaky: Love ya Towlie!
[6:56:51] ollansky: @Towelliee isnt leveling in prepatch faster?
[6:56:53] ClassicMalcontent: Okay. I have an idea. Make some servers with NO Boosts, NO Tokens etc etc and others with. Win-win.
[6:56:53] GOD_NAT: Will boosts be available from pre patch or actual tvc release?
[6:56:55] Longlastnamae: Boost all you want, but know how to play the damn character when you get it there
[6:56:56] Shenun: no
[6:57:03] Tharia: nope
[6:57:03] TheDarkestSentinel: no
[6:57:03] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[6:57:04] MR_Basil: nope
[6:57:06] Broomba: there is not
[6:57:09] rooperi77: no, go east
[6:57:09] jasonbriggs: plus your only allowed one boost per acc
[6:57:10] Tharia: that was the worst pita
[6:57:15] TheDarkestSentinel: Sto... is horde
[6:57:25] cashaga: do u only get to copy 1 character?
[6:57:26] ClassicMalcontent: I would choose the NO Boost, NO Token, NO In-game store version.
[6:57:37] Joryckfree: if they still want boost then whatever I really think he has a lot of points and its just true , but yeah I m chill its till just a game
[6:58:05] beckett3a: man every tbc zone is so pretty
[6:58:05] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:58:06] Wildsmasher: Any Tips for new streamers towelliee ?
[6:58:06] Joneeeez: I would really like to know the release date soon, tbc is the best
[6:58:07] cashaga: do i get to xfer all 5 of my lvl 60s or just 1?
[6:58:13] metavahn231: i just saw a outriders ad and it looks like its marketed to fortnite players
[6:58:16] ClassicMalcontent: @Joryckfree "chilll its just a game" a game some do not want ruined like retail went.
[6:58:27] Mitune: I think we need the ESO buy a real pizza in game option LUL
[6:58:32] Thepilli: soooo is it possible to tank dungeons  efficiently with questing/58 boost gear?
[6:58:34] emperormingg: i thought it was really logical and well laid out
[6:58:34] stratiss: Maybe we can get specific servers that do not allow boosts?
[6:58:46] Joryckfree: @ClassicMalcontent yeah but what can you do force people to change their minds ?
[6:58:48] ClassicMalcontent: So take my idea. Make some realms with No Boost. No Token. No in-game store. Offer the options to playrs.
[6:58:51] FatChase: Just joined who we talking about
[6:58:55] KaisenSiru: So true squadSpeech squadSpeech
[6:59:02] solid_reaperx: jesus god yes
[6:59:05] Joneeeez: they are called classic Andys xD
[6:59:12] solid_reaperx: someone clip this and upload it to the tube
[6:59:13] pavepawns: @stratiss that would split community even further cause of 1 small choice
[6:59:13] MuttonChopins: nothing is ever gonna look like 2007
[6:59:14] ClassicMalcontent: @Joryckfree no offer options. Realms where you DISABLE all those.
[6:59:19] einself111: i mean you enjoy all the stuff in retail the boosts the race/gender/faction change store mounts ... can you understand some people just don't want that ? and wanted classic in the first place to not have that ?
[6:59:24] Heekss: you can never get the same nostaltia feeling thats what claassic andys do not understand
[6:59:24] ClassicMalcontent: Tjat
[6:59:29] Uki88: who is he talking about?
[6:59:31] N64atNite: TRUE
[6:59:35] Rujean: Towelliee, the only things I want for TBC is dual spec, and Blizzard to introduce the new pvp system that exists in retail that eliminates the pvp servers.
[6:59:37] Joryckfree: @ClassicMalcontent actually that sounds good
[6:59:42] Chad_Chonker: Also the players are way different
[6:59:44] Reklusion: Who even cares what madseason has to even say lmao.. dude is boring
[6:59:46] KaisenSiru: and aging happened.
[6:59:48] Thepilli: @Towelliee  soooo is it possible to tank dungeons  efficiently with questing/58 boost gear?
[6:59:50] BananaNeal: yeah. memories are what we got
[6:59:51] ClassicMalcontent: That's fine but it's stil not an excuse. Offer realms where they have none. And others where they do. Then people can CHOOSE.
[6:59:56] Mitune: The problem with a no boost, no token server is that bots would actually prefer that. @ClassicMalcontent The economy is higher and gold is easier to make. People cant compete with a bot, so bots can run the economy faster
[7:00:01] TheUnknowing: Do you think blizzard is honestly releasing classic tbc solely for our enjoyment and nostalgia? no, they are releasing it for money. lol
[7:00:19] ClassicMalcontent: @Mitune boosts actually make botting worse not better.
[7:00:38] cashaga: Blizzard back then was the nerdy comic book card shop guys that played table tops, Blizzard today is walmart of mmo's
[7:00:38] Mitune: @ClassicMalcontent yes but boost are bought from other botters not blizzard.
[7:00:39] MuttonChopins: everyone knows they are releasing it for money
[7:00:40] einself111: @TheUnknowing i mean every 1 is paying the monthly sub or no ?
[7:00:41] TuhrbanNovice: real talk
[7:00:48] pavepawns: having realms with boosts and not boosts splits community further and creates way more toxicity then we already have. and we have a shitton of toxicity already
[7:00:55] ClassicMalcontent: @Mitune if you have realms with 1.) No boosts, 2.) actually ban boost accounts, 3.) you preserve in-game economy.
[7:01:06] alsorrr: guides everywhere LUL
[7:01:11] itsreptarlol: spittin truth lol
[7:01:13] cashaga: Bliz-Mart
[7:01:20] TheGiant99: why make people level in classic if all they wanna do is play TBC
[7:01:20] ClassicMalcontent: I say make realm options and let players choose.
[7:01:21] Longlastnamae: most of them working on it were not even old enough to game yet
[7:01:25] einself111: Look man we are greedy bobby needs his bonus so fuck you players LUL
[7:01:36] emperormingg: lazy logic, blizzard are bad so why bother
[7:01:37] sifer007: LUL
[7:01:37] ClassicMalcontent: I am all for choice.
[7:01:38] Mitune: @ClassicMalcontent That is the problem though. The issue isntt the boost its the need for banning and blizzards vigilance. That is what is lacking
[7:01:45] AureliusXV: hell yeah
[7:01:55] Uki88: "noting can stop it"? ever heard of the company running this game? LUL
[7:01:55] AureliusXV: all the tokens
[7:02:02] Mitune: I do agree with choice but it doenst solve the bots
[7:02:05] TweakT: token makes my blood boil
[7:02:06] Tyrsfal: @Towelliee I'm not fussed about the boost thing, see pro's and con's but you nailed it by saying that shit doesn't personally change how I play (you in this context) at all
[7:02:06] Katzushirou: I mean, token wont help againts botters selling goods on the ah
[7:02:10] ClassicMalcontent: @Mitune sure. Of course. But boosting makes it worse not better. Regardless, I say offer the option for realms WITH and realms WITHOUT.
[7:02:10] morganamoone: EZ just ban the bots
[7:02:12] cashaga: They let it happen in china so they got an IN for it in global
[7:02:13] TweakT: but i like having people pay for my gametime
[7:02:23] Marah57: yes
[7:02:27] sifer007: Botting = more money
[7:02:38] Neowanderer: speaking of tokens why remove 30, 90, and 1 year subscriptions
[7:02:42] Uki88: how about they dont give that baffoon a 200 mil bonus and fucking hire some ppl? @Towelliee
[7:03:05] shadowsarescary: @Uki88 fair point
[7:03:07] Thregenbeck: they didnt, they removed 30 90 and 1 year game time
[7:03:07] cashaga: if they gave him 200 mil imagine what the shareholders got
[7:03:09] pavepawns: just skip all the classics and go to mop
[7:03:20] Longlastnamae: I wish I was a Mapper for Questie. I would be mapping this whole MF ;)
[7:03:23] TweakT: because of greed
[7:03:24] TettixHD: to charge more
[7:03:26] JonnasINF: I thought it was just gametime and not subs
[7:03:27] Neowanderer: its fucking weird
[7:03:29] FatChase: It wasn't a subscription, it was gametime
[7:03:36] TweakT: they dont like players like me that pay 65 euros for 6 months of gametime instead of 78
[7:03:41] Shrenko: are anyone buying game time these days? I think everyone is subbed
[7:03:57] Mitune: @ClassicMalcontent I agree with the choice but the option wouldnt change the occurrence of bots or their effect on the server.
[7:03:57] cashaga: i buy gametime with retail gold
