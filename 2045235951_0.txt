[4:04:06] SpectraBG: hi Lux
[4:04:14] BONDbl: more Pwave thats all our damage
[4:04:25] trinilime: whats the tier set bonus for ele?
[4:04:26] BONDbl: with 6 flameshocks Pwave = lust for the entire pull
[4:04:32] BONDbl: no save fire ele big pull coming up
[4:04:48] BONDbl: make sure you reset magma too
[4:05:39] BONDbl: yep
[4:06:36] BONDbl: it does but it's padding :)
[4:07:12] 2prac: lower levels EQ is shiet
[4:07:14] BONDbl: lavaburst non stop, we want the babies to live LONG because you are perma blood lusted with 6 flameshocks
