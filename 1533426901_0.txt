[0:12:43] TheeLazyDuck: just wait for release lmao
[0:12:44] Azikielboi: itd be pretty bad form if he had to start cuz ive never heard of towellie bad mouthing mike before now @TheeLazyDuck
[0:13:05] Azikielboi: @dareetv because preach is upset he didnt get in, and said that he is salty
[0:13:11] Dirtnose: people hungry for drama this morning huh
[0:13:28] Azikielboi: not towellie is satly, mike said "i am salty"

[0:15:15] Evilbreed83: has towelliee mentioned if he's got some new alerts coming for the new expansion

[0:15:47] The_Farting_Spaniard: @TheeLazyDuck  Fucking true
[0:16:51] Cranxjs: well why should u give alpha to somebody says no to wow, u want positiv feedback, even its alpha
[0:17:01] sodomisten: i've heard Towlie gives out alpha keys ;)
[0:17:28] Azikielboi: @Cranxjs i agree preach should not get alpha, but i wouldnt make fun of him about it
[0:17:35] Azikielboi: its just kinda bm to a plenty nice guy
[0:17:38] Evilbreed83: maybe him saying he wouldn't play alpha is a reason he didn't get it
[0:17:47] Azikielboi: @Evilbreed83 agreed
[0:17:49] Lasidor: @Cranxjs No, you want honest feedback.  Lets be real, Preach not having it is truly a whatever issue.  However, if you win him over with Alpha thats a lot of positive feedback, if you dont, everyone already knows how he feels about WoW lol
[0:17:53] The_Farting_Spaniard: A lot of people said no to WoW, even Towelliee when the Blizzard allegations were going on @Cranxjs
[0:18:03] Biggles_93: pepeBASS
[0:18:19] Cranxjs: ok, well i am new at towelliee :x
[0:18:33] Cranxjs: but u are right, honest feedback is better
[0:18:33] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[0:28:21] Ghunthor: good morning from Romania
[0:28:23] jasonbriggs: preach quit wow why would they
[0:28:24] Azikielboi: he didnt flame really, he said he is salty but gets why they didnt give him alpha
[0:28:31] ijuki: @Azikielboi Nothing on Reddit is real... just simply ignore it and it will die on its own
[0:28:35] Azikielboi: @jasonbriggs ur not wrong
[0:28:44] The_Farting_Spaniard: Think someone needs to look up the definition of what flaming really means
[0:28:51] Azikielboi: @ijuki the strummer here himself posted the stuff so thats not as true
[0:29:03] lmtheboogie: He can still get it. Maybe just not day 1
[0:29:09] ca8l: grooten tug
[0:29:10] ijuki: Flaming = Using fire to roast something... no?
[0:29:10] Azikielboi: i dont think preach shoulda gotten alpha but 100% he doesnt deserve bad mouthing
[0:29:41] PToastman: all the best to preach but yea to use a poor analogy if you break up with someone you dont get to whine when they date someone else
[0:29:43] ijuki: @Azikielboi I do not even read and take Reddit seriously...
[0:29:48] yonish25: Bfa soundtrack?

[0:30:11] Cabbageman007: Preach chose his side...he lost

[0:30:32] Kinghorn: I do not know how the man is up this early, I would still be passed out in a puddle of my own drool
[0:30:36] ijuki: Preach will play WoW sooner or later, everyone knows that :)
[0:30:41] Azikielboi: @PToastman its true, but he didnt really badmouth about this
[0:30:57] Azikielboi: he didnt flame
[0:31:09] Cabbageman007: Watch the clips Az ...he was pissed...his words
[0:31:22] Azikielboi: others are flaming him which is weird, he is behaving, he just said "i am salty i didnt get in, i loved the game for so long."
[0:31:42] Azikielboi: @Cabbageman007 pissed is not the same as flaming tho, he didnt insult blizz or anything
[0:31:46] quakegoogl: catJAM draFireblu draRage
[0:31:55] aladinsane444: @ijuki if preach would start streaming wow again, his chat would explode from rage

[0:32:19] Kinghorn: cobaltSmug
[0:32:30] MrGattz: @Hubba_Bubba nah hes taking a shower usually and getting breakfast
[0:32:32] Azikielboi: @Kinghorn thats true, but its not about this
[0:32:50] lmtheboogie: Blizzard does what they want
[0:32:52] The_Farting_Spaniard: @Kinghorn Everyone insulted blizzard months ago though during the sexual allegation charges.
[0:32:58] Hubba_Bubba: ok I will be back then
[0:32:59] OlysseGaming: !uptime
[0:32:59] trestin3: blizzard deserves being insulted

[0:33:13] Manferno: We all talked shit about Blizzard and rightfully so
[0:33:15] jasonbriggs: over the years preach has been a great wow content creator and he had his reasons on why he quit playing
[0:33:20] Azikielboi: i mean regardless, mike doesnt deserve flaming, preach is a fine boi
[0:33:21] NieIas: didnt towelliee say yesterday that asmon wasnt gonna put his react to the ion interview out for a few days? its been up for 2 days already LUL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gSW8C8Togs

[0:34:05] Dadghar: he is nice guy
[0:34:28] Azikielboi: @Dadghar preach viewers u mean? i agree his chat is getting bad, but thats not entirely his fault (though not 0% his fault)
[0:34:38] trestin3: I think everyone still playing wow are insane,  game hasn't been fun for soo long now
[0:34:41] Dadghar: yes the viewers
[0:34:43] lmtheboogie: If preach gets alpha access then all this talk was for nothing
[0:35:01] thatdanishguy666: @trestin3 not been fun for you maybe
[0:35:09] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @PToastman (warning)
[0:35:15] MrGattz: @trestin3 i mean thats your opinion. theres still plenty to do in the game even if you have played for the last 10 years.
[0:35:29] PToastman: sorry didnt realize it was a link without the prefix
[0:35:29] cynical_effect12: @trestin3 yet here you are
[0:35:31] lmtheboogie: Fun is subjective
[0:35:39] Azikielboi: @lmtheboogie this talk is more about people flaming him/towellie saying he has a big ego, which just seems kinda rude
[0:35:48] browniebatter: @trestin3 fun is subjective, and half of the people that say that watch wow streams. which is more weird lol
[0:35:49] lukepizzaguy: i did Enjoy SL
[0:35:51] Azikielboi: i dont see why mike deserves a flame here

[0:36:08] PToastman: im not seeing anything too mean
[0:36:26] Azikielboi: @PToastman it wasnt turbo rude which is why im 100% willing to believe im misinterpreting
[0:36:33] lmtheboogie: Everyone has their opinion which is fine. It’s ok to respectfully disagree. I think people forget that lol
[0:36:44] Azikielboi: but it seemed kinda iffy so i think towellie owes a clarification
[0:36:56] TheItalianStallion321: @lmtheboogie NO WE HAVE TO FIGHT EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH US kekw

[1:14:13] Nerendis: I have food poisoning. I wish I was hungover.
[1:14:24] Kevst0r: maybe a weird take but dragonriding kinda reminds me of the flying in anthem
[1:14:29] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I mean, I'm sure they will expand that dragon riding system to other mounts with their own unique abilities, why do you think they added stables in the main cities?
[1:14:32] yaashs: best thing about dragonriding, is the fact that people cant just AFK in the air... making the world seem more alive, you see more people on the ground.

[1:18:09] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Can't wait for Blizzard to add more visage forms in the later patches
[1:18:10] Radiopools: "simulacrum" that's not the real Sindragosa
[1:18:10] ktrain92: simulacrum means like a hologram
[1:18:12] Syprus1: riffYeti
[1:18:13] thepaladinjournal: it says arcane simulacrum, so she's basically an intelligent projection left behind by the real sindragosa
[1:18:14] Lasidor: Arthas returning to Azeroth, confirmed.
[1:18:16] amrazzjosh: How are you enjoying the alpha? Would you pre- order based on what you have played so far?

[1:22:22] lithium364: ferals sadge
[1:22:25] Divinal15: well a class with 3 dps specs is normal at least one really good spec xD
[1:22:25] manmower: warlocks have historically been overtuned the most out of all classes
[1:22:26] Ellysia_Banearrow: Wowhead has the trinkets up, are they in the raid journal?
[1:22:27] procyon_mfc: I'm playin destro right now after a year hiatus and love it

[2:33:06] manmower: age 40 you gotta hit the gym hard
[2:33:11] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i feel u bro i had to get rid my stones via surgery it was hell lol

[2:33:30] Wcvechten: don't  forget to set the DJ to mythic incase of extra mechanics @Towelliee
[2:33:31] Brodih_: im 39 and i really feel my age when I go to the gym, otherwise im good
[2:34:05] Ghunthor: @Towelliee warr or palla for dragon? im just making a new char and i want to have invites in m+
[2:34:14] Prollimix: dragon
[2:34:15] cesspooll: im 35, and athletic and feel great. But i dont drink or eat trash food

[2:34:36] NieIas: URF KEKW
[2:34:41] Wolfenhoof: @Qazh_ Lucky me i got light arthrosis in the fingers at 42, so i had to stop lifting.
[2:34:42] Molvonos: @JLmorten Just gotta eat some carbs and drink plenty of water to offset it.
[2:35:07] riotinprogress: @JLmorten, does it take you 2 days to recover after a night of drinking now?

[2:35:33] Brodih_: ah that kinda sucks, you know what caused it, or it was just age? @Wolfenhoof
[2:35:47] Prollimix: @Towelliee so this boss sounds like a new Lei Shenn?
[2:35:47] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:35:47] Squirrel_nutty: cesspooll are you trying to be a troll?
[2:35:48] cpain__: @throdio busted!

[2:36:23] instant_savage: hammers up! pally telents when? i cant wait anymore
[2:36:28] cpain__: lol
[2:36:42] Wolfenhoof: @Qazh_ I have no clue. Its not that bad in day to day life, but training was over. Could be worse. Lost 20 kg. I didn't got fat at least and doing only cardio now.
[2:36:47] Polarisss_: Sounds like iskar from hfc a bit
[2:36:49] instant_savage: instant_savage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:37:02] Vandristine: no he gains the stacks to dela more damage
[2:37:20] Prollimix: @Polarisss_ maybe Iskar and Lei shen but sounds more like the thunder king to me
[2:37:25] manmower: maybe Thrall can do a cameo in this raid
[2:37:31] dumax26: 7 yard is not a lot
[2:37:32] Kickitnine: my uncle drank like 3 pops a day since he was young and now hes 60 had no kidney problems seems crazy to me
[2:38:13] Brodih_: good for you! You could just do body weight training also, its still a good workout @Wolfenhoof
[2:38:36] cesspooll: the elders are though. Just like my dad at 75 years old. But he never vaxxed or introduce to all the fast food  such as mddonalds and so on
[2:39:19] Wolfenhoof: @Qazh_ Yea some push ups, crunches, powerwalking and poweryoga. I am fine. I still miss my weights and the pullups from time to time though.
[2:39:56] ninetysix: whats ur HP total these dmg numbers are high ?
[2:39:56] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:40:00] cesspooll: Its going to be tougher and tougher for each generation to survive to 40 years old with all the poison that gets shove poison down their throat
[2:40:12] cesspooll: eat healthy guys <3
[2:40:14] Vandristine: wonder if they are entirely random on what two elementals spawn
[2:40:16] Wcvechten: Lei Shen vibes tbh, looks great to me
[2:40:33] Vandristine: thats also mythic damage
[2:40:45] Armdel: probably less complicated than the journal makes it look
[2:41:17] Blankelos: or the brawl fight reminds me of
[2:41:39] PvtHudson093: the guys from ubrs
[2:41:51] InconCLEAVEable: @Towelliee looks like mannaroth in a scale suit
[2:42:12] Wolfenhoof: @cesspooll Yea processed modern food is cancer. Literally.
[2:42:33] theDirtyon3: @Wolfenhoof hes in here trolling just dont respond to him LUL
[2:42:38] manmower: that's how they choreograph
[2:42:43] Molvonos: Some of those also might be placeholders
[2:42:53] tronbadgames: @Towelliee there was an item for the og onxyia attunement, that made you look like one of those dragonkin. wonder if the model is updated on those
[2:42:57] Wcvechten: Energy bars are basically timers that are visible to everyone
[2:42:58] JesuisLukas: @Towelliee do you squint with your right eye?
[2:43:06] SpyCrabbo: i can tell you from experience that nobody but the raid lead looks at the energy bar
[2:43:16] fyfaentv: Do you think they will start implementing more stats again like we had before (Expertise, armor pen, hit rating) ?. And what is your opinion on those stats?
[2:43:20] Feisti718: It can help with accessibility
[2:43:34] dwolters_the_zombieman: that troll is just being a dick
[2:43:46] JesuisLukas: same bro, born blind on my right eye, been squinting with it my whole life @Towelliee
[2:44:00] lmtheboogie: Good. I hate depending on addons
[2:44:14] grumpnamedjosh: Probably easier to balance the bosses if all they have to change is increase or decrease energy rates
[2:44:22] sellblade: I just got thinking. This is the first time in a long ass time that the First released Raid of a WoW Release has an actual Tier Set again. Nathra obv not, Uldir didn't, EN did not, Highmaul didn't, Mogu'shan did not, though it did get followed up by the actual T14 Raids quickly. Cata was the last time.
[2:44:38] ArcaneSyntax: the stats we have now are complicated enough, no need for more
[2:44:53] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[2:44:54] DragonofWolves: DragonofWolves subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[2:45:00] Jokervenom1978: true
[2:45:07] Aquadriel: we dont know if we will get set bonuses.
[2:45:09] killuminativi: what was the stat called again that kept you from missing attacks as melee, Hit something (back in WotLK)
[2:45:15] jberry: @towelliee you gonna pick up a profession?
[2:45:15] pootsmcgee508: yeah i think BWD was last time wow
[2:45:15] bigoldmeatpie: it had the visuals but not the bonuses
[2:45:20] manmower: first raid doesn't need tier, since all your new talents are the new spec feel
[2:45:20] binkz77: is the tier craftable
[2:45:21] zabloin: holy smokes its rly been 7 years since i first watched towellie..
[2:45:27] Kisswani: did Bastion of Twilight have tier >
[2:45:27] AnotherCheche: nice belt
[2:45:29] BriscoGDP: @killuminativi expertise
[2:45:37] sellblade: Yep, cata was the last time an actual first raid of an expansion had tier.
[2:45:38] pootsmcgee508: MoP was mogushan vault
[2:45:41] Phanopov: MoP had tier
[2:45:43] Aquadriel: EN and highmaul, had tier looking armor, just not tier bonuses, we dont know if we will have bonuses on this one yet, do we? @Towelliee
[2:45:44] Molvonos: Not for first Tier
[2:45:45] sellblade: Like the first Raid we enter
[2:45:45] KirbyDLX: There was
[2:45:46] Wcvechten: mogu'shan vaults had no tier
[2:45:46] Armdel: there was
[2:45:48] ArcaneSyntax: mogushan
[2:45:49] gPhobos: did they change what the dragthyr look like? and whats your thoughts so far
[2:45:50] tposingsnorlax: Will the tier sets in this expansion be called Tyr sets? That'd be neat.
[2:45:50] luke238: ye
[2:45:52] Clawanorder: MoP had tier
[2:45:52] pootsmcgee508: heart had it but mogushan came out first
[2:45:53] Armdel: there wasn't in the first raid, but there was
[2:45:56] fewyn: there was tier in mop tier 1
[2:45:57] Phanopov: It had
[2:45:58] mikenukem88: Yes
[2:46:11] fewyn: yes it did
[2:46:11] Phanopov: Yes
[2:46:13] Armdel: nope
[2:46:13] spekktrum19: No
[2:46:20] pootsmcgee508: mogushan did not have tier
[2:46:21] Molvonos: Mogu/HoF didn't have tier
[2:46:22] spekktrum19: HoF and Terrace
[2:46:23] Lasidor: Heart of Fear
[2:46:23] Aquadriel: EN and highmaul, had tier looking armor, just not tier bonuses, we dont know if we will have bonuses on this one yet, do we? @Towelliee
[2:46:28] tronbadgames: @Towelliee no tier
[2:46:29] Polarisss_: no tier in first raid. of mop in the 2nd raid HoG
[2:46:30] sellblade: Mogu'shan did not have tier, we're not going by the combined Tier, but the FIRST raid you ENTER.
[2:46:34] yasuoo7: @Towelliee what is the obsedian vault or tower something  ? is it a raid aswell
[2:46:35] RixeD: how does shaman gear look?
[2:46:38] raye_gaming22: bot for evoker kekw
[2:46:38] NieIas: remove filter
[2:46:41] NieIas: it says evoker
[2:46:41] SwifSkully: They had to introduce tier sets in the first raid right? Since a lot of borrowed power elements are no longer being included
[2:46:42] raye_gaming22: bot
[2:46:43] Phanopov: You need to change loot
[2:46:48] Gillettefuzionz: remove evoker filter
[2:46:50] Dkgungo: you wont see it because there was no evoker tier
[2:46:52] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  remove filter
[2:46:52] Polarisss_: no it didn't
[2:47:07] Verdell263: Heart of Fear had all the tier
[2:47:12] lynixxis: HoF and Terrace had tier.
[2:47:17] Polarisss_: ^^^
[2:47:30] Polarisss_: no tier in vaukts
[2:47:33] pootsmcgee508: that was also the first time they did the intro raid thing
[2:47:44] fewyn: it was basically a raid tier... didn't it all come at launch? i forget
[2:47:53] yasuoo7: @Towelliee what is the obsedian vault or tower something ? is it a raid aswell
[2:47:55] binkz77: is tier craftable
[2:47:56] lynixxis: Well, people consider Highmaul and Black Rock the same tier, but Blackrock had higher ilvl and tier gear.
[2:48:00] sellblade: So if we take both views into Account Cata or MoP were the last time that happened. Which is a long ass time @Towelliee
[2:48:03] dmune96: More grounded loot experience this time?
[2:48:16] ArcaneSyntax: about a decade, wow
[2:48:17] sellblade: It's fun

[2:49:16] Buckwink: please tell me we are getting razorgore back
[2:49:31] euphoricc_q: ive played many rpg games before like ragnarok and elden ring will it still be hard to adapt to this game?

[2:51:01] yasuoo7: u can get 2 welps per staff
[2:51:08] gdtomii: Of course getting rid of the eggs is the designed part of the fight
[2:51:14] Phanopov: Yes!
[2:51:16] sellblade: Reverse Razorgore does sound interesting too, where you have to actually avoid breaking the eggs KEKW
[2:51:18] manmower: gonna have to designate egg beaters
[2:51:20] grumpnamedjosh: She can’t die while the eggs are alive, her life is linked to the eggs alive.
[2:51:20] Phanopov: Probably
[2:51:22] Kisswani: yeah , I thought that as long as eggs live boss doesn't die ?
[2:51:26] gdtomii: sounds dumb to put it there but no do anything about it
[2:51:38] ninetysix: from what i understand its a dps check the eggs are aesthetic @Towelliee
[2:51:39] xnorthtv: so greatstaff seems like a move and run away mechanic. it also seems the eggs are staggered around the room. you're job is to move away from group, and not hit any eggs in the process.
[2:51:41] tettles: 193 raiders from tettles have joined!

[2:53:07] yasuoo7: @lithium364 she is acutally a egg trafficker
[2:53:08] manmower: @lithium364 if we don't kill her she's gonna spawn more Dracthyr
[2:53:09] Kisswani: danDerp my brain hurts
[2:53:11] sellblade: Boss infuses egg, which you want to deal with, perhaps. Otherwise you try not to open them.

[3:05:41] ijuki: But in seriousness, 6-8 minutes are great actually
[3:05:43] RudeMood: 7.5 min isn't too bad, just long enough to make you start feeling it start to drag, then it's done
[3:05:44] Orion280: anduin is the most difficult fight still in the raid right now i feel
[3:05:46] nezorflame: It’s hard to have 100% concentration for 10+ minutes straight
[3:05:47] Adirtan: 10mins is pretty ok if mechanics are also engaging,.
[3:05:49] Miklagart: Sylvanas is long and fricking boring,

[3:05:51] Buckwink: Sylvanas was horrible no thanks
[3:05:56] OGXanos: Theoretically a 'clear night' with little to no wipes should never be more than 2 hours.
[3:05:59] Wcvechten: I hated the sylv fight, only p3 mattered
[3:06:02] Adirtan: Sylvanas was not even fun fight whcih is sad
[3:06:10] Buckwink: we were selling Syl kills and I wanted to log off forever
[3:06:11] raye_gaming22: TAHT BIZTCH WAS !% MIN
[3:06:14] NordicWolfie: when you can lust twice the fight is too long
[3:06:15] shrimpjuice: mechanically sylvanas was easy, its the coordination and wipe mechanics
[3:06:15] RudeMood: No one liked Sylv fight
[3:06:16] wanosp: wanosp subscribed with Prime. 
[3:06:16] raye_gaming22: 15 min
[3:06:22] TJdps: i remember kj was like 13mins in ToS
[3:06:47] Kandrell: Can u show the loot?
[3:06:48] ImASquishyFish: Did they fix the proto drake running animation? Ulduar acheiv are the only ones that have the proper one
[3:06:48] tronbadgames: @Towelliee i feel like a raid shouldnt be longer than your average movie. just for attention span lol
[3:06:52] PvtHudson093: no way of practicing P3 on Sylvanas killed the fight for me
[3:07:17] EKS90_: no spine of galakrond please LUL
[3:07:26] nezorflame: Dragon soul flashbacks
[3:07:31] Vandristine: 10 fights but every boss is just a body part of galakrond
[3:07:34] pootsmcgee508: madness of galakrond monkaS
[3:07:34] lithium364: 60 min galakrond fight with more then 20+ oneshot mechanics Kappa and the secret phase is flame leviathian with vehicles kekw
[3:07:35] ninetysix: @Towelliee galakrond in DF?
[3:07:39] Adirtan: i rather see them cut 5 bosses and add mechanics from them to the rest
[3:07:40] Lenietwitch: if a character is that great, what do you think of 2 fights being just 1 ?, simiular to cataclysm but make it good lol
[3:07:53] aligned1: i feel like raids should be 6-8 bosses
[3:07:55] Muaytitus: galachron should be like a new Ony lair, but like a 15m fight
[3:07:55] NeverStopRaging1: who knows at this point
[3:07:57] Pilha390: yep
[3:07:59] nezorflame: All new
[3:08:00] Rizendragon37: ICC/Ulduar/SoO were perfect size imo.
[3:08:04] EKS90_: Im pretty involved in dragon lore of wow, but I don't remember any of these at all, they are all new
[3:08:04] eakiller: to nobbel

[3:08:06] Gambit2012: where's denathrius?

[3:08:34] Khakiduck: except the last tier haha
[3:08:35] Wcvechten: Lei shen was mentioned in MOP questing
[3:08:36] Adirtan: he will lead us into Burning Legion once again :D
[3:08:38] Kale_Nd: mop
[3:08:38] Molvonos: Started in MoP
[3:08:40] CarlTheCatFish321: yes
[3:08:41] nelorixx: he was introduced in mop
[3:08:42] Pilha390: he was on mop
[3:08:42] sellblade: I think if they approach a Spine of Galakrond these days, it could be a lot better than the Spine of Deathwing. They can do more now or try a completely different approach, like a boss fight ON the Spine of Galakrond with something else, so the Spine is just a moving Zone, like Grimrail, Naglfar.
[3:08:44] thetruegodofwarr: yes

[3:09:22] Relynq: kekw jailor
[3:09:22] NieIas: LUL
[3:09:22] lalelusa: MoP had great lore/story
[3:09:36] EKS90_: im a big advocate for cataclysm, i love that expansion, except what they did to deathwing, i do not like his fight, but I think they have evolved their ecounter philosophy so much, we will not have that again.
[3:09:40] vDrYuukey: Denathrius was cool
[3:09:41] gali5656: jailor rich history spanning back 20 years
[3:09:41] Aquadriel: hope we fight Gargalon
[3:09:47] raye_gaming22: she is introduced in this zone here , she wants to kill of mortals and and blue dragons who use the arcane magic
[3:09:49] BigHeroSixy: MoP is very much the idea of going on an adventure where people have their own history and you come into that history. Its nice.
[3:09:53] Pilha390: that is why some like denathirus soo much
[3:09:58] NieIas: ion compares Dragonflight to MoP and im all for it
[3:09:58] DarkenedHour97: what about the jailer saying they are coming?

[3:10:35] nezorflame: @darkenedhour97 just wait for 2-3 expansions
[3:10:42] sellblade: Malygos but without the crazy, Raszageth just a bitch at normal mental health KEKW
[3:10:43] Armdel: remember when they hinted at the jailer in wc3
[3:10:49] thetruegodofwarr: is a group of malagos called malageese?
[3:10:53] mandilozano: hopefully they do a dragon flight type fight like the malygos fight
[3:10:57] Exxcar: Morning all
[3:11:01] ninetysix: i have a leak bolvar went rogue and is raiding stormwind in the last raid @Towelliee
[3:11:05] Wolfenhoof: @Adirtan At least he had lines. Thinking about Baine for the last years...
[3:11:07] Adirtan: @thetruegodofwarr malygooses
[3:11:08] EKS90_: @Armdel In a book, under a staircase in stratholm 100%
[3:11:53] lalelusa: that has to be an energy bar type of thing
[3:11:57] sellblade: Yep
[3:11:58] Adirtan: @Wolfenhoof well Baine is irrelevant for ages so yeah
[3:12:03] Wcvechten: wings might be the soft enrage for p1
[3:12:22] Muaytitus: ofc gotta be movement based fights, gotta let the evoker shine
[3:12:25] Wolfenhoof: @Adirtan he sat longer in oribos than sylvanas will probably spent in the maw
[3:12:29] thetruegodofwarr: liquid will demonic gate it at 100 percent dont worry lol
[3:12:29] Wcvechten: ye
[3:12:53] atyllia: pushback pfft, laughs in death's advance
[3:12:54] Adirtan: @Wolfenhoof i kind afeel like he will sit there for anotehr 3 expansions :D
[3:12:55] Kisswani: goblin jump

[3:13:23] Molvonos: Vengeance Demon Hunters: "My time is now!"
[3:13:37] Adirtan: @ttmaker coz he is not max lvl??
[3:13:39] sellblade: Stand in Tank explosion when she Wings.
[3:13:42] Khakiduck: it is gonna be funny during a fight watching all the evokers fly from one side of the room to the other over and over again
[3:13:48] sellblade: Or the field after rather.
[3:13:55] Rudric_Ice: did they release the warrior talents yet ?
[3:13:56] ttmaker: he is playing evoker tho
[3:14:09] sellblade: It specifically says forced movement
[3:14:10] ninetysix: just bring 20 boomkins and spam convoke ez W
[3:14:16] sellblade: The forced movement would be the knockback, no?
[3:14:18] TheZlare: TheZlare subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[3:14:19] thetruegodofwarr: like fel rush
[3:14:20] Voidheim: @Rudric_Ice nope, same with paladin. still waiting
[3:14:22] atyllia: forced movement so like fel rush?
[3:14:23] strike879: i do hope they do a tomb of sargeras thing again where you kinda need the new class for a boss
[3:14:24] Maneguster: Forced movement effects aka knockback
[3:14:25] lalelusa: "forced movement effect" would a push, right?
[3:14:26] Adirtan: @ttmaker well its Alpha, it always have that kind of stuff :)
[3:14:27] raye_gaming22: froced ist the wind i guess
[3:14:27] BryanMalcolm: use the forcefield to reduce knockback from the boss?
[3:14:49] atyllia: yeah it's probably for that
[3:14:51] sellblade: What Bryan said is what I mean. You want to explode as a Tank somewhere where we can safely go stack in the field for Wings.

[3:15:47] Rudric_Ice: are these  raid mechanics final ?
[3:15:52] lithium364: that bronze dragonflight building in the main city looks for sure like an future raid entrance
[3:16:09] lalelusa: what's "within range"? like how many yards?
[3:16:14] thetruegodofwarr: probably have to go through multiple puddles to survive stacking wings
[3:16:18] SeckSymbols: @lithium364 Probably will have to do with the Infinite Dragonflight
[3:16:20] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Not even close
[3:16:22] sellblade: Bronze anything is gonna be interesting, specifically because we got all those historical datamined maps.
[3:16:28] sellblade: Like Gnoll Wars, War of the Shifting Sands etc.
[3:16:29] SeckSymbols: Might even be the expansion we see Nozdormu go bananasx
[3:16:34] strike879: do we get an ingame dictionary shees some of these words

[3:18:35] atyllia: only thing Denathrius p1 did was to destroy my FPS
[3:18:41] raye_gaming22: same on sylvanas you ahd to ahrd dps stop
[3:18:46] P4RT1CLEM4N: Not boring for healers, donny P1
[3:18:51] lalelusa: "lfr friendly" phases
[3:18:52] Miklagart: Razaketh is a demon in mtg lore
[3:18:57] Orion280: we had to stop DPS in p1 denathrius so someone rolled off if they could afk
[3:19:01] Wcvechten: Honestly, that raid for an opening sounds really good
[3:19:08] dragothicx: is Blizzard still planning on changing Shadowlands old raids for Season 4? how come there's been no actual info of that yet?
[3:19:15] Soniye_: hy Towelliee, something off topic, did you already have the chance to do some customizations on your dragon?
[3:19:25] venom366: i do Kappa
[3:19:27] Alexkayzz: How many dungeons we got? The usual 8?

[3:19:36] Armdel: nah its old
[3:19:41] Maneguster: its used rarely
[3:19:45] EKS90_: @Alexkayzz 8 and then in mythic+ we get 4 of the new 4 old ones.
[3:19:47] atyllia: they just barely ever appear
[3:19:47] sellblade: It's been there, but we rarely see diseases KEKW
[3:19:54] Wcvechten: not many actual disease abilities for bosses tb h
[3:19:55] Alexkayzz: @Commander_Eggi oh cool, thanks!
[3:19:56] SeckSymbols: So this dungeon must be why they are brining poison cleanse totem back LUL
[3:19:58] mekatok: pac man ghost icon
[3:20:01] EKS90_: @Alexkayzz then they switch in season 2, the other 4 new ones and 4 new old ones
[3:20:05] Aquadriel: can you see the boss models towelman?
[3:20:18] Snabido: Wailing Caverns POGGERS 😏

[3:20:45] Theliahh: @DarkenedHour97 iron docks is S4
[3:20:48] sellblade: Wailing Caverns M+ could unironically have some interesting Routing decisions
[3:20:51] SeckSymbols: Just give us Scarlet Monastery back
[3:20:51] P4RT1CLEM4N: How many new dungeons will there be total, 8?
[3:20:51] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:20:56] DarkenedHour97: @DarkenedHour97 ahh mb

[3:21:18] goosejamss: all mount models

[3:21:26] Lasidor: SHAAAAAAAAMAN
[3:21:27] Mutsein: They need to not reuse old content. Bring in 13 new dungeons when they release xpac. Sure, some old dungeons are cool.. but it comes off as lazy...
[3:21:39] goosejamss: mount models and crafting recipes
[3:21:43] Diamondead1: LUL

[3:24:17] TheItalianStallion321: that is new
[3:24:21] Stoffy1: Stoney McStoneface
[3:24:24] Mutsein: @SeckSymbols No, and its gonna be a shitshow no matter how they try and scale things. Alot of these dungeons are not made with m+ in mind - and the playerbase is gonna suffer from it.
[3:24:25] Alexkayzz: That's a fire mage pot
[3:24:29] Janigiv: PogChamp
[3:24:33] Orion280: 4 min pot sounds sick
[3:24:38] TheItalianStallion321: nice haste on that
[3:24:51] thetruegodofwarr: how long is the cd on combat pots
[3:24:59] SeckSymbols: @Mutsein They already had challenge modes for those dungeons back in the day which is very similar to the M+ format so you're wrong and should feel bad
[3:24:59] atyllia: 5min base
[3:25:02] OGXanos: I think 'light' stam stacking may be back
[3:25:14] sshadeh: @OGXanos oh?
[3:25:15] ijuki: The question remains, can you wear that without being alchemist if you make it through work order? jakbTHINK
[3:25:18] EKS90_: @Mutsein They are taking dungeons from MoP and forward, which mean its dungeons that had challengemodes or m+ if ur in a legion dungeon, it will be fine.

[3:26:27] SeckSymbols: @Macroversal_ Why is that a bad thing when we are getting crafting sets?
[3:26:38] Mutsein: @SeckSymbols Challengemodes and m+ cannot be compared.  Nonetheless its lazy content. We pay a high premium for essentially a new game, and every expansion they release. It comes with fewer raids, fewer dungeons, less new gear etc.   Its a spiral of lazy work.
[3:26:42] KatieGaming: rip lost ark LUL we stopped playing too

[3:27:17] Moobot: @Uchiha_Evil TBC UI: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25206-TowellieesTBCClassicElvUICompilation169.html |SL UI: wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[3:27:23] MrGhostlore: yeah, I wanted the mechanical feel but with quieter sound.  so that is why I went with the brown.  but still feel clunky to me
[3:27:36] Cranxjs: shield is nice :o
[3:27:36] Mikromanagement: no substats tho
[3:27:37] goosejamss: @Mutsein yeah dude stop being so butthurt and go play Genshin or something
[3:27:43] KatieGaming: @silkster0 dragonflight, alpha...beta... he dont care about another mmo rn lol
[3:27:49] DreamK33PeR: Shield that gives both str and int ??
[3:27:56] strike879: ''taking damage reminds you of home'' kinda wierd that
[3:28:03] Mutsein: @SeckSymbols how so, cus i dont agree with your opinion or? i play wow quite a bit. high m+, clearing all raids etc. im just getting kinda sick of that lazy craftsmanship.
[3:28:14] Cranxjs: @DreamK33PeR pretty sure that will give u just one, depends on ur spec
[3:28:20] Partizangaming: It will be more or less equal
[3:28:20] SeckSymbols: @Mutsein M+ Evolved from Challenge Modes, instead of sticking with the same 8-10 dungeons all expansion, rotating them out with older stuff to keep the experience fresh i a better overall experience
[3:28:23] OGXanos: @Towelliee I think BIS is gonna be a nice mix of crafted x tier
[3:28:37] Macroversal_: omg finally
[3:28:42] SeckSymbols: @Mutsein And 15's aren't high M+
[3:28:44] DreamK33PeR: @Cranxjs Look at the epic boots. They say str or int
[3:28:49] Megadisaster24: Crafting should be as good as raid gear, I miss when recipes used to drop in raids
[3:28:50] Aaradin: morning brother.
[3:28:55] DreamK33PeR: @Cranxjs Why one say it properly and other dont?

[3:28:56] tronbadgames: engi + alchemy
[3:28:57] TJAB0: One thing with TBC i realy like is that you can get BIS item from your proff
[3:29:03] ChaoticPriest: I love my engineering on my DK. Always have since Legion. @Towelliee
[3:29:05] Mutsein: @SeckSymbols you really come off with a know it all vibe, but you really start sounding like you have no clue what you are talking about.
[3:29:06] sshadeh: i feel forced to have gathering + producing
[3:29:25] Cranxjs: @DreamK33PeR maybe just not correctly implemented :D
[3:29:27] MrDoucheBagel: Bofa dem? Urf? LUL
[3:29:28] cravendraven_: did you already look at the alchemy potions added?
[3:29:28] kyr_slowbro: Producing should come with the gathering
[3:29:32] Snabido: Gathering for everyone, crafting for few
[3:29:35] Dassine: Either make gathering profs standard, or just fold them into their relevant crafting prof (skinning gets folded into lw, mining with bs, herb with alch, etc)
[3:29:38] tebbix: I have never got in to professions, hopefully I will in this expansion
[3:29:41] SeckSymbols: @Mutsein I know a lot actually, you just cant see how challenge mode dungeons are why and how we got M+
[3:29:43] offspringer: claps
[3:29:46] ijuki: @sshadeh Now you do not have to, you can use work orders
[3:29:48] SirMaldo: new world!
[3:29:49] Janigiv: im still mining+herbalism @Towelliee :)
[3:29:52] KatieGaming: ill just be over here in the archeology club waiting for its return BibleThump
[3:29:53] AndrewCK27: That would be so sick
[3:29:55] Mutsein: @SeckSymbols +15s are not high keys, lmao eks dee funny guy :) go do your normal raids. child.
[3:29:57] Wolfenhoof: Yes please, just let me gather... was such a nice system back then in Everquest 2 already.
[3:30:04] AveragePvp: Had eng since bc on my main, if they do anything cool with it I’ll be happy
[3:30:04] xReadyAimMissx: ugh I wish I could do all the crafting stuff. I rarely play multiplayer characters. danSad
[3:30:05] DreamK33PeR: @Cranxjs Or maybe is it properly. We will have items with both str and int. It would be amazing
[3:30:06] itzdom3: they wont less wow tokens
[3:30:13] SirMaldo: like new world
[3:30:16] OGXanos: It's a good idea on paper. How do they balance that with the new profession gear? Do you have to have 3 gathering sets? 4 if you do fishing?
[3:30:19] Darzetti_: yea you got a good point there.
[3:30:22] SeckSymbols: @Mutsein Where am I wrong in that statement of 15's not being high keys>
[3:30:22] cabalish: @KatieGaming i am too, there is so much potential
[3:30:27] boraga: It doesn't make sense that just because you're a mining expert, you can't stop on the roadside and pick a flower.
[3:30:29] Cranxjs: @DreamK33PeR yeah maybe =)
[3:30:30] TheGiant99: But isnmt kinda about making choices
[3:30:33] Trombol97: its max  5 people for note right now
[3:30:33] KatieGaming: there really is @cabalish
[3:30:35] Dortalon: you need to log 3-4 characters now to cover your trades
[3:30:43] Kisswani: with dragon risding I wonder if druids will still have an advantage in Herbalism , since they can't fly in flight form
[3:30:45] EKS90_: @Mutsein Having the dungeons rotate with new eevery season is a great change, puts less pressure on people coming back, when people havee had the same dungeons for a year or something.
[3:30:49] mrfear420: so no gold from them , sucks
[3:30:51] silodin: 100% agree
[3:30:56] SeckSymbols: I will just always have a druid for my gathering professions, just how it is
[3:31:00] LegionOfFate: Do you think that would mess with the economy?
[3:31:05] OGXanos: please do, and make a video
[3:31:06] Poriand: maybe one day they give people a 3rd profession
[3:31:06] Featherbow: I'm too dumb to pick a flower, but damn if I can't skin an animal >_>
[3:31:08] tronbadgames: @Towelliee it's the inclusive vs exclusive debate. stuff like gathering should be for everyone to participate in - it's just better gameplay
[3:31:09] strike879: having the proffesion should give more but everyone should be able to get a bit so lets say 2 per node base 5 with proffesion
[3:31:10] adeekoowy: Albion online have best crafting and gathering system.
[3:31:10] silodin: i love mining as a skill in any game but i never pick it because it is sub optimal
[3:31:10] Mutsein: @SeckSymbols you are completely right, but you try and make me look dumber by asuming thats the limit to what my knowledge is, which is just sad as an arguement in this discussion.
[3:31:10] OGXanos: Hell get another interview
[3:31:11] Aaradin: That is actually a great idea
[3:31:11] itzdom3: WoW Tokens
[3:31:18] ijuki: Work orders will elevate some of the crafting problems
[3:31:18] Macroversal_: people still lazy af
[3:31:19] TheGiant99: Market would be in the toilet for that stuff
[3:31:19] Kisswani: could be technical as well
[3:31:21] SeckSymbols: If economic inflation was a thing then FF14's economy would be shit
[3:31:22] CyonDru: maybe not enough nodes
[3:31:22] pootsmcgee508: they may not be able to even give characters more than 2 main profs
[3:31:24] Macroversal_: I don't it'd be bad
[3:31:27] boraga: Or make "Forager" one of the professions and it's all gather profession. Who cares?
[3:31:31] smile0sv: @Towelliee bots thought of that?
[3:31:34] KatieGaming: LUL
[3:31:36] Luxicake: KEKW
[3:31:36] Megadisaster24: Market is broken because of bots
[3:31:41] Zettabyte: "ion, we neeed to talk!" Kappa
[3:31:41] Aaradin: it shouldnt take any skill points to gather / do work, just to make stuff from the shit you brought back lol
[3:31:43] akia03: to the ion phone
[3:31:45] GivTater: maybe if you dont have the prof you pick petals and a certain number of petals makes the herb like in Legion
[3:31:47] Snabido: Alternative would be letting those profs increase yield, but everyone can still gather
[3:31:48] dantheeman239: @Towelliee did you already review the raid bosses?
[3:31:52] 0doz: lostark have that gathering system too..
[3:31:56] OGXanos: no like specifically ask for a small one just for this, scripted even
[3:31:58] d2darkalliance: That would destroy the economy. It should be more choices and not less
[3:31:59] Redpandalol: ion its ya boy...wanna talk?
[3:32:01] Aaradin: lol
[3:32:07] Kisswani: @GivTater great idea
[3:32:15] Galadeon: caving to casuals
[3:32:19] Shiggih: can have all gathering professions, however you can only have 2 crafting professions?
[3:32:39] cravendraven_: did you see the after death potions?
[3:32:41] TJAB0: Do you think they even have discussed this?
[3:32:41] Kisswani: not without traditional flying
[3:32:42] pmprdnk: bots can just train those professions anyways
[3:32:47] Muaytitus: but arent the important mats soulbound?
[3:32:47] EKS90_: @Galadeon Casual players are the backbone of an mmo, no the 1% raiders.
[3:32:47] boraga: Bots are a dumb argument, everyone who is already botting is already botting.
[3:32:49] Wolfenhoof: 50% of the material in the auction house is bottet anyway.
[3:32:53] Plaffy: the zones looks so beautiful, i cant wait to explore them myself.
[3:32:53] strike879: all bots already have herbalism so no change there
[3:32:53] Aaradin: saturday whiskey is the best lol <3 you brother
[3:32:54] knyttneve: @Towelliee To be honest, ESO have the best system when it comes to gathering and reagent bag. The infinite reagent bag is such a good QoL thing and it WoWs reagent bank with 100 slots feel very dated!
[3:33:00] Shiggih: or all professions but can only specialize in 2, giving you the normal amount from them?
[3:33:03] GivTater: @kisswani im smart sometimes.
[3:33:04] Snabido: Go back to non sharing Kappa
[3:33:07] ShackSupp: Do you think they would cap how much you can gather in a day?
[3:33:08] FermiTorok: Hoping they let Dracthyr stay in true form when on mounts in final release, getting forced into visage is weird.
[3:33:16] sshadeh: @boraga true, it's usually fast to level gathering professions anyways
[3:33:16] MrPresidentSean: oversupply already will be an issue with cross region AH
[3:33:16] griffdog125: yep still see the packs of druids flying around lol
[3:33:19] SeckSymbols: @Towelliee It would just be like FF14's economy, even with everyone being able to do every profession, its still a very healthy market
[3:33:19] TheGiant99: @Towelliee but dont you like the idea of making choices
[3:33:32] Relynq: 100% agree about the gathering
[3:33:34] OGXanos: gotta have 3 druids, worgen, and each tauren
[3:33:35] ItsGlime: 20$, buy any mats you want KEKW
[3:33:36] tebbix: I only have engineering because of the portals in SL lol
[3:33:37] Robodope: Every node you have to solve a captcha
[3:33:37] Kisswani: I have been Enchant / Tailor on my main since TBC LUL
[3:33:39] Catori94: true make farming free for all
[3:33:54] ShackSupp: Gathering talent trees
[3:33:55] MrPresidentSean: Or just give BS the mining skill and alch the herb skill
[3:34:01] Wolfenhoof: @OGXanos There can't be enough Tauren in Azeroth!
[3:34:02] drakestear: eh I always do a gathering and crafting on each characters minus my enchanter who also does clothcraft
[3:34:05] d2darkalliance: Hardcore crafters buy Mats from ah and not farm it
[3:34:05] apb89: Damn I was hoping they would remove engineering only battle rez
[3:34:22] Armdel: i liked it when engineers could craft really good helmets for early game
[3:34:30] nelorixx: Tinker class pepeMeltdown
[3:34:31] SeckSymbols: @MrPresidentSean But then Engineering and JC wouldnt have mining, same with incription, unless you are including those in it
[3:34:38] LarcenousLaugh: That scroll of sales sounds nice
[3:34:47] Maneguster: What if they added a small minigame (Like fishing) to gathering and made them baseline?
[3:34:51] sshadeh: gathering can be really big money early expansion
[3:34:52] TheOldSchoolRyan: Maybe pick a single gathering profession in addition to two crafting
[3:34:56] sshadeh: like in shadowlands it went wild
[3:34:58] Gambit2012: we'll get bard before tinker
[3:34:59] RiskyChristian: i would give anything for a tinker class :(
[3:34:59] OGXanos: we'll get a Bard first
[3:35:06] instinctdt: we’ll never get the tinker class :(
[3:35:08] SeckSymbols: @Maneguster Like FF14's gathering? I wouldnt mind it
[3:35:09] Wolfenhoof: The Tinker-Bard together with housing.
[3:35:11] Gambit2012: sent it
[3:35:16] theDirtyon3: Evoker is a bard LUL
[3:35:16] Squirrel_nutty: the necro class was a good one
[3:35:17] gunit2624: towellies character is trying to escape death
[3:35:19] venom366: like monks and pandas Kappa
[3:35:19] Lasidor: I mean Evoker isnt far off from a Bard
[3:35:20] Arkangel_I: that take is sizzling
[3:35:21] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee New Xp mists of tinker town
[3:35:29] sshadeh: Necromancer
[3:35:32] KaptnG: They prob didn’t give Drakthyr tank because tinker is next expac
[3:35:35] Rudric_Ice: tinker will be out next expac
[3:35:41] OGXanos: Not really, they're on about this letting support be something other than heals so it's probably been brought up
[3:35:43] Molvonos: As someone who played Bard in Everquest, I disagree with the idea Evokers are equal to Bards.  Not even close.
[3:35:56] strike879: blizz doing only a single gather as extra will be a bigger shitshow then none at all
[3:35:56] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW Editable UI System - DRAGONFLIGHT ALPHA EXCLUSIVE youtu.be/jst2FvVYB00
[3:35:59] Gambit2012: made me laugh to see how much reaction that take got. Made my morning lol thanks guys
[3:35:59] Aquadriel: thats so bad
[3:36:06] Bliffzy: yooo
[3:36:08] George2001k: @towelliee the problem with mining and herbalism being free, is that people most people are just going to use them as merch to be sold in the AH.
[3:36:09] brandon_tapartos: they could make a witch doctor class pretty easy
[3:36:10] LarcenousLaugh: eeek didn't see the one day thing
[3:36:10] Kisswani: @SeckSymbols I would agree if it had no GP . I hate having to wait for GP to fill or using an item to refill
[3:36:12] Aquadriel: literally no point on using that KEKW
[3:36:14] lithium364: inscription needs more then darkmoon decks
[3:36:19] Zansteh: dont we have mounts with vendors KEKW ?
[3:36:20] cerealkillas22: POGS
[3:36:22] Robodope: is water still nerfed
[3:36:38] OGXanos: With the new raid buffs coming, add a few others, bring some back. weave in some damage, boom you got a bard.
[3:36:41] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani I agree, I just think gathering in FF14 is miles ahead of WoW
[3:36:46] tronbadgames: @Towelliee can you ask them to increase quest log limit? 25 is from TBC, decade+ without any QoL improvement is sadge
[3:36:54] George2001k: @towelliee they have their main professions and if they won’t be able to use herbs or ores, then it’s only for the AH.
[3:37:12] temp3st98: so basically legendaries style of crafting
[3:37:16] procyon_mfc: sweet
[3:37:25] hasan666: So do we have legendary system in DF?
[3:37:35] procyon_mfc: I see what they did there
[3:37:40] Snabido: Bit on the nose with those names, but sure LUL
[3:37:41] SeckSymbols: Make jewelcrafting a good profession again god dammit
[3:37:43] OGXanos: Stam tho
[3:37:51] Kisswani: @hasan666 Ion said no SL or legion style legendaries
[3:37:52] Kavieonn: Towelliee is it easy for you to get into mythic+ for this game? i always struggle

[3:44:49] FearedReaper: ive played wow since legion and never have played pvp once
[3:44:51] Thunder4o: @Towelliee it will be WoD gearing way,which means PvE gear wont be any good in PvP so you are wrong
[3:44:56] Rudric_Ice: PvPers hate everything
[3:44:56] George2001k: @towelliee just give them their own gear, separate from PvE. Give them back resilience and let them go f themselves…
[3:44:58] temp3st98: so much added why not bring back resiliance again
[3:45:00] Fawcheddar: I like pvp and I think its fun

[3:45:18] Wolfenhoof: People who are playing mainly PvP in WoW WANT to suffer anyway.
[3:45:19] Rudric_Ice: Pvpers hate everything they also hate Pvping
[3:45:20] mandilozano: crafting is not pve tho
[3:45:27] minimedic3: well they could put it up on the new crafting auction thing
[3:45:28] manmower: PVPers and RPers = same people

[3:46:01] SouvlakiTheBest: wow pvp hate from pve heroes is real
[3:46:06] Kisswani: They should have no interaction with the world period Kappa
[3:46:08] Wolfenhoof: There should be one server that is only a huge arena with a token vendor.

[3:46:40] Pilha390: oh no
[3:46:40] George2001k: @towelliee 2 trinkets that have base as resilience and a full gear set that also has resilience will stop pvpers from wanting to do anything but pvp
[3:46:45] OGXanos: I'd like them to make an option to double transmog the head so we could have things for the face like glasses or masks and also a hat
[3:46:47] Dahlvash2: Luck is a crafting stat
[3:46:48] Armani1Xp: Make pvpers touch grass of Azeroth again

[3:47:18] dareetv: immediately "can u wear two of them?" XD

[4:00:56] HaloS23: controls
[4:00:57] FamLeeGaming: Controls
[4:00:57] maalow: and more stacking
[4:00:58] MMokuin: bank combine too?
[4:00:58] Fleymour: but bagnon has still the cooler look tho
[4:01:03] nelorixx: HYPERS Don't need Bagoon no more
[4:01:06] DrakeDuude: I wish we had a shared bank tab for all toons
[4:01:06] SonofHorus82: going to be nice to be able to clear out some Add On space.
[4:01:07] akia03: its in the bag option aswel
[4:01:12] npc_vibez: oooooo yay
[4:01:20] mute_paladin: I think bags at this point anything higher than 40 slots is not needed. They should really reduce the bag slots and turn it into storage space.
[4:01:23] Darzetti_: i would think so
[4:01:30] mytherel: been using bagnon since I was a wee one, its like family now
[4:01:32] Galadeon: I'll stick with Ark Inventory
[4:01:34] OGXanos: If it doesn't, sounds like a bug to report
[4:01:35] sshadeh: @mute_paladin yeah
[4:01:36] BelacKriv: does it do the categories / sorting like adi bag?

[4:02:06] sellblade: Should be able to still buy basic bitch bags in the Drag, no?
[4:02:07] Rudric_Ice: yes it sorts items too
[4:02:08] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  do u know what will happen to the Reagent Bank?? if we're getting Reagent Bags?
[4:02:11] Tjenne92: have your gear in 1 bag, junk in another
[4:02:18] Snabido: Clap

[4:02:46] akia03: check the option panel in bank window
[4:02:48] Wolfenhoof: i would never combine my bags, but bank would be dope
[4:02:49] Fleymour: but bagnon has still the cooler look tho (like mine is see throu / black) and odc the bank looks same. and you can add several plugins for the bagnon @Towelliee
[4:02:51] Cozzmolot: if not, then that's another addon you kind of want to have
[4:02:52] Aidler: they can still do that
[4:03:01] kayed3: Thanks @Towelliee SeemsGood
[4:03:06] UlsterFarl: I wish WOW would add a companion system always liked having an NPC for company in Legion.  Just make it more in depth like in SWTOR or ESO.
[4:03:17] AveragePvp: I wonder if they are gonna add the clean up button to guild banks
[4:03:18] HaloS23: @Towelliee i would also ask to track more than 3 currencies too
[4:03:20] Lightemp: @Towelliee also to add a search/ organize
[4:03:20] cudlsac: Any word on new Battle Grounds for Dragon Flight?
[4:03:27] sshadeh: I have alway used default UI in WoW LUL
[4:03:30] geraldtgnome: @Towelliee if your looking at your audio have a look at dante for network enabled audio, have mine running though this app on a 27onch touch screen https://imgur.com/a/amnCrSx
[4:03:35] RealSolaroid: God I hate twitch ads
[4:03:39] Tizbit: ive never not used default UI
[4:03:39] OGXanos: baffles me they don't just hire ELV
[4:03:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: bagnon also lets you see what your alts have so its still far superior
[4:03:40] Kisswani: I'm probably trying default UI with WAs on DF
[4:03:42] DenizUK: when does dragonflight release?
[4:03:44] Shrenko: I think default UI in DF looks better than any UI addons I use atm
[4:03:46] Rowini30: @sshadeh scary
[4:03:46] Fleymour: blizz UI still super low buget and very low on infos
[4:03:46] PAX1US: im okay with using default if it does the addon's job properly
[4:03:47] Steelsky_: I switched out of Elvui for a couple of months and I'm not regretting it tbh
[4:03:54] TakeThatBack: ya but if addon makers just have to do reskins, instead of what they currently do I bet it will chew up way less memory
[4:03:55] SpookBoio: @DenizSeason unknown
[4:03:56] Rudric_Ice: i won't im uninstalling my Dominoes in DF
[4:04:00] the_kisner: I would prefer to use default UI for performance reasons, ElvUI is pretty resource heavy
[4:04:01] ccoraxx: i love synching all my addons everytime i launch the game XD
[4:04:04] Shrenko: I hate elvui
[4:04:05] sshadeh: @sshadeh and i used to be a skill clicker back in the day. truly the worst monster
[4:04:24] WennixD: You could consider swapping to base UI now just for performance if you have to
[4:04:56] tebbix: True KEKW
[4:04:59] OGXanos: Did anything change with Heirlooms?
[4:05:02] cynical_effect12: I wish they would either do away with pet battle week or add a time walking event or something with it that week

[4:11:25] cerealkillas22: Turalyon got blocked by a hand
[4:11:30] Pappahealar: They should just remove gray items, just make mobs and quests drop more gold. Makes no difference. Gives us more bag space and they don't have to increase bags every expansions.
[4:11:30] Nevindaz: like Jaina
[4:11:31] Miertez: i kinda like turalyon to be honest
[4:11:32] Vaken_: I mean Turalyon would be an easy boss, considering Illidan blocked his sword with his hand. And we beat Illidan 15 years ago. So this boss would be far to easy for us;)
[4:11:34] Aquadriel: anduin would be "let them burn another tree and we see whats up :) "
[4:11:36] cerealkillas22: Imagine getting blocked by a hand KEKW
[4:11:37] sshadeh: @manmower why tho, they even have the mage district
[4:11:40] UlsterFarl: Last issue that Stormwind had was with VanCleff  and Oynixia.  Will be good to get some focused Alliance politicking
[4:11:46] Alienfromger: beta anduin KEKW
[4:11:46] strike879: its the same irl any bady in movies is either german or russian
[4:11:46] Nevindaz: Jaina , Tyrande .. drama
[4:11:48] Algfader: Turalyon trying to cancel Anduin cuz he refuses to call him by the pronoun he wants.
[4:12:04] gritbarontv: lol
[4:12:06] unresolved_broccoli: tht looks like a rogue set
[4:12:08] tebbix: Demon hunter looks like a power ranger KEKW
[4:12:11] UlsterFarl: Some of the gear looks sick
[4:12:13] Darzetti_: cool shoulders
[4:12:13] grimmy17: Stiven did all of them, just waiting for wowhead to farm the clicks by releasing slowly
[4:12:15] HoofTV: Would the alliance want a different leader than Anduin??
[4:12:18] Kisswani: the helms are strange , I like everything else
[4:12:20] VitochieR1: So sick
[4:12:22] Alepouditsa: power ragers KEKW
[4:12:22] generaljosh721: I don't get DH vibes from that set haha

[4:12:25] Wrex36: demon hunter sets go BRRRRRRRRRR
[4:12:25] sshadeh: the concept art looks WAY better
[4:12:29] Megadisaster24: Turalyon will side with Yrel when the Light Corruption invades Azeroth from AU Draenor
[4:12:30] akuma_46: nobody wearing that help where the horn go?
[4:12:31] TechNinja20: awful helmet
[4:12:38] sshadeh: LUL
[4:12:40] Alepouditsa: @tebbix aaww you say it faster then me LUL
[4:12:40] Darzetti_: LUL
[4:12:43] VitochieR1: Compared to this tiers mogs these are FIRE
[4:12:44] Djfarmville: Far left one is a warrior cmon
[4:12:45] cerealkillas22: i like it
[4:12:45] Echosapian: OKAY THAT ONE LOOKS FIRE
[4:12:46] Luxicake: danHmm
[4:12:47] mandilozano: concept art might be for mythic
[4:12:47] manmower: the concept art wasn't a human model
[4:12:47] unresolved_broccoli: meh
[4:12:47] DaniLaDee: Need the horns
[4:12:48] Molvonos: You're not gonna like the Pally set when it shows.
[4:12:48] Steelsky_: the mage one looks incredible tbh
[4:12:50] PAX1US: i still feel like 9.1 armors are the best
[4:12:50] arturiuss44: it always looks not great when they do the models on human
[4:12:53] OGXanos: It looks off cause it's not on an elf
[4:12:55] tronbadgames: @Towelliee LFR vs Mythic?
[4:12:56] Ilibrit: The helmet is all off
[4:12:57] Goomiie_: concept art could be for mythic
[4:12:57] sshadeh: the leather raid armors these days look like plate armor, its stupid
[4:12:58] lonew0lfgamer: Looks like Kmart Batman LUL LUL
[4:13:00] OviTheGray: DH model and shows on human with no horns :)
[4:13:02] Wrex36: concept will usually be idealized though
[4:13:05] RiskyChristian: it could also be the normal or LFR set
[4:13:05] Wolfenhoof: After they took away Cairne from my proud folk i can't say i care for the alliance leadership. Fuck em ScaredyCat
[4:13:06] hadiibal: yeah
[4:13:08] strike879: concept prob mythic
[4:13:18] tebbix: @tebbix The first thing I thought when I saw that lol
[4:13:18] hadiibal: there should be other colors
[4:13:26] Darzetti_: !water
[4:13:36] Frank4LuLz: more shots
[4:13:40] PAX1US: @Wolfenhoof alliance has nothing to do with Cairne's death but ye it was sad to see him go
[4:13:41] Wrex36: will look better on the elg models too
[4:13:41] feel__alive: man i should go to the gym
[4:13:44] Wrex36: eld
[4:13:50] Wrex36: elf omg
[4:14:19] Wolfenhoof: @PAX1US Yea with "them" i meant blizzard. Something died in my azeroth-self that expansion.
[4:14:29] Echosapian: there should be build up in complexity and color with each difficulty tier, the concept art looks sick af
[4:15:02] Wolfenhoof: Horde got so shitty leader-deaths. Cairne off screen, Vol'jin so pityful. #sadmoo
[4:16:06] aladinsane444: Song?
[4:16:18] Buckwink: that DH transmog looks like shit not gonna lie KEKW

[4:21:10] npc_vibez: why they always tone it down, why cant we look fancy af
[4:21:11] LeBigNose: "shoes" need a bit of work
[4:21:14] Rudric_Ice: TOES POGGERS
[4:21:16] Luxicake: all this armor and then my toes sticking out?!
[4:21:17] Little_Sprouts: boots?
[4:21:19] Echosapian: i don't mind the mage set
[4:21:21] Beltorz: shamans look amazing
[4:21:22] Mr_Knecht_Shaft: as a mage main i could cry its so ugly KEKW
[4:21:32] Shrenko: its probably normal / mythic @Towelliee
[4:21:33] unresolved_broccoli: they probably are
[4:21:41] Miklagart: it looks like a nelf female in the concept
[4:21:45] Nevindaz: daltosnism dev KEKW
[4:21:45] Starryskys: the drawings looking amazing
[4:21:46] Echosapian: looks like some dauntless armor
[4:21:46] MrFuzzynuts420: yeah not digging it
[4:21:49] SensationalBanana: Shame that the sets never look as good as the concept art, tbf.
[4:21:56] bigoldmeatpie: it's because the concept art doesn't use a silhouette that exists in game
[4:21:59] Bernardo994: ever thought of bringing a random viewer to bruv night
[4:22:05] Macroversal_: agreed
[4:22:07] Rexialiton: Yes agree
[4:22:07] pavepawns: i prefer theme
[4:22:07] Murlock07: Truu
[4:22:08] rymerre: exactly
[4:22:09] Starryskys: I agree
[4:22:10] ztilleto: yeah
[4:22:10] Mojohusk: It's so clunky ingame. Concept art is fine
[4:22:11] SirMorky: aye
[4:22:11] sshadeh: yes
[4:22:13] generaljosh721: Tier 6 got it right
[4:22:16] 0ddReality: YEP
[4:22:17] Gingerprimer: nah
[4:22:21] Miklagart: yea like ice crown citadel
[4:22:26] Miklagart: it was perfect
[4:22:26] manmower: yea hunters should always be green
[4:22:31] WinglessAngels: totally agree
[4:22:31] Starryskys: old school sets
[4:22:32] sshadeh: @Towelliee leather armors look like heavy plate these days
[4:22:34] EpicJune: the tiers look all like shaman gear LUL
[4:22:37] waaambulance_: tier 6 is the best one
[4:22:38] Rakish44: shaman sets for everyone this tier
[4:22:39] baaronthemonk: being same color does help you blend colors with other tier sets for transmog
[4:22:41] strike879: @towelliee is there going to be a upgrade into tier system in dragonflight too?
[4:22:44] Araphas: @ProgettazioneInferni me too, we where really spoiled in Legion
[4:22:45] Murlock07: I want it that way I don't dig this same Raid setting gear set
[4:22:51] Frank4LuLz: mis guided
[4:22:53] tebbix: Yeah we need Tomb of Sargeras type of tiers
[4:22:54] xnorthtv: I was thinking, colour scheme based off the class. so mage blue, pali pink etc. cause all of these new arts kinda look the same especially because of the colour.
[4:22:55] generaljosh721: it's definitely a director decision
[4:22:56] tronbadgames: @Towelliee think we'll see more than 1 tier set per class in DF?
[4:23:00] feel__alive: uldir was pretty trash ya
[4:23:02] rick_morks: uldir was better than nyalotha
[4:23:08] Miklagart: legion was also really good with the class sets
[4:23:08] Echosapian: if they stuck with class colors influencing armor color, i don't think anyone would be upset
[4:23:11] PvtHudson093: oh god not that set]
[4:23:12] sshadeh: Uldir looked worse than wotlk questing gear
[4:23:13] pavepawns: @Towelliee id rather have tier themed raid sets. and then i would like a class set reward for something like a mage tier content
[4:23:18] Eraste: all bfa gear was pretty bad imo
[4:23:21] MrFuzzynuts420: yeah it's not lazy. it's just their philosophy about how it should look is different from what players want.
[4:23:21] SirMorky: I loved the Ulduar tiers from Wrath.
[4:23:37] Frank4LuLz: mop sets bis
[4:23:39] Macroversal_: as a dk that set looks pretty good tho imo
[4:23:40] sshadeh: @Eraste the 2nd tier was okay on some classes
[4:23:43] FusionKissMe: @morkgaming hes talking about BFA
[4:23:43] Eraste: i like these tier sets so far they just look kind of same-y
[4:23:44] Starryskys: people want awesome transmog
[4:23:57] nexusg4miing: this is by design sir , they will put better transmogs in the shop for u to buy
[4:24:02] Molvonos: That's what they had from Classic to LK.  But it was like, one to three pieces of gear.
[4:24:03] manmower: put the cool xmog on the renown tracks and make it class specific
[4:24:05] Starryskys: they do look very similar
[4:24:12] SirMorky: @fusionkissme ahh fair doos
[4:24:18] XarkoLP: 2 transmogs in one raid? aint nobody got time for this
[4:24:23] Taylormade2711: have they said there reason for the current tier designs?
[4:24:31] Darzetti_: yes this is good but they gotta keep it up
[4:24:35] Kisswani: @nexusg4miing there has never been better transmogs in the shop , ever
[4:24:40] Buckwink: they should have an entire team dedicated to talents then
[4:24:41] Orion280: it's only been hunter and DK so far tho @Towelliee where priest and druid at
[4:24:51] Nevindaz: mathilShake
[4:24:52] abracka_: keep this level of communication always honestly, even outside of alpha/beta. it's refreshing to see
[4:24:54] Faraday5001: theese feedback posts about hunter and DK are actually giving me the most hope about DF
[4:24:56] cudlsac: I hope we get new Battle Grounds at some point
[4:25:00] sshadeh: @Orion280 where my warlock talents
[4:25:03] manmower: this new system is forcing them to start balancing some talents
[4:25:04] ArmenZz: release 2023 march ?
[4:25:18] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:25:20] nexusg4miing: cosmetics i guess
[4:25:22] Darzetti_: they finally came back and sat down at the table with us now they just gotta stay seated and not get up again
[4:25:25] Archmage_Michael: I think that;s great but why didn't they do it in the past  ?
[4:25:40] zgag: Hunter problem was brought up in the forums and Blizzard moved pretty fast
[4:25:47] Nebulizer87: No no we have to see if they actually speak up about monk/mistweaver xD
[4:26:03] ShowDUH: Oh no not Maizon NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:26:12] ShowDUH: Maizou*
[4:26:16] zgag: Max even admitted that Bm  hunters are the odd class/spec out for raids
[4:26:21] pringlez91: Looks like the WoW D'Flight alpha is taking the MMO by storm
[4:26:22] DeanoTV: serpent sting Kreygasm
[4:26:23] zgag: As of right now
[4:26:27] Archmage_Michael: Hunter needs a raid buff, like Hunter's mArk add 5% crit for everyone against that target
[4:26:46] Orion280: where is the communication for priest, druid and rogue? @Towelliee only seen hunters and DK so far
[4:26:47] ShowDUH: No that's just bad
[4:26:49] sshadeh: i will rather take the MM talent that shoots serpent sting with every aimed shot
[4:26:51] ShowDUH: nothing on HM plz
[4:26:54] Nevindaz: tneKhadgarWut
[4:27:08] Featherbow: I kinda miss True Shot aura tbh
[4:27:09] RiskyBusines_ez: 5% crit is pretty pog
[4:27:11] Scraggersmeh: Without a raid buff in DF, Hunters just won't be brought. They are the squishiest, are generally tuned really poorly by looking at Shadowlands tiers. Just no point bringing them if they aren't bringing utility.
[4:27:12] bigoldmeatpie: yesterday
[4:27:18] pavepawns: new
[4:27:31] Taylormade2711: they should give a talent that if you have serpent sting and use multi shot it does serpent spread like old survival
[4:27:31] zgag: Problem with BM is that if BM gets anything good there would be an outcry about how BM can move and attack.
[4:27:32] OJ_MasterJuice: hunter and ele sham are the onlz ones that really need a raidbuff, theyre in major danger of underrepresentation
[4:27:33] Upcomin: @Scraggersmeh KEKW
[4:27:36] tenbones: those hunter changes are quite good
[4:27:42] Frank4LuLz: hunters be 3 buttons still
[4:27:58] miku1: what are monk talent trees like?
[4:28:00] Zendero89: basicly all balance druid talents currently PepeHands
[4:28:04] RiskyChristian: hunters have a 3 point talent that will only net them 2% crit
[4:28:05] Taylormade2711: also hopefully chimaera shot is good. really wish they would put it back as the big shot instead of rapid fire
[4:28:06] SirVoro: Not Chimera Shot D: Whatever will I do with a talent I never use
[4:28:06] pavepawns: hunter had a 5 point in the bottom row which got changed to 3
[4:28:08] pavepawns: so thank god
[4:28:10] Wolfenhoof: @Frank4LuLz I hope so. Let my BM alone, i need a class i can still play in 10 years when i am 60
[4:28:17] OJ_MasterJuice: @miku1 non existant
[4:28:26] Nokterian: LUL
[4:28:27] miku1: @OJ_MasterJuice Sadge

[4:28:31] RiskyBusines_ez: the poll is a good thing lol
[4:28:33] zgag: PI should just be self cast.

[4:28:36] Nokterian: towStop towIt
[4:28:45] Frank4LuLz: @Wolfenhoof  KEKW  ill be there too then with my DK
[4:28:46] Austei: this gonna be good
[4:28:56] Relynq: Yes just rankings lol
[4:28:57] RiskyBusines_ez: has nothing to do with how the ability functions
[4:28:58] RiskyBusines_ez: wierdchat
[4:29:00] Relynq: Not eliminating it
[4:29:03] Thasin22: I dont get why ppl care so much
[4:29:03] Thoreya: im option 1
[4:29:06] manmower: just leave it
[4:29:09] nexusg4miing: who cares
[4:29:09] Kisswani: this is th emost e-peen thing ever
[4:29:12] Thoreya: dgaf
[4:29:15] zgag: If PI stays the way it is number 5 is the best
[4:29:18] Kuhani: option 5 sounds good
[4:29:18] abracka_: PI is vanilla world buff argument in retail at this point lol
[4:29:18] Orion280: 5
[4:29:18] OJ_MasterJuice: whoever cares about this needs to  acquire some real problems
[4:29:21] DrakeDuude: ban completely
[4:29:22] Thoreya: they should add an option 6. i dont give a fuck
[4:29:23] Nevindaz: 5
[4:29:23] manmower: the only people who care about the rankings are the PI stackers, so it doesn't matter

[4:29:51] VitochieR1: Competition is fun
[4:29:51] Scraggersmeh: and you got 0
[4:29:57] P4RT1CLEM4N: PI should be self-cast only

[4:29:59] thatdanishguy666: DPS cares when you need a log that have not been feeded 4004040 PI over a fight
[4:30:01] MisterBongwater: PI junkies
[4:30:04] Kisswani: number go big , me no like danDerp
[4:30:06] Thoreya: this is the most literal "its the player not the game"
[4:30:08] DrakeDuude: parsing for getting recruited is crucial
[4:30:08] Thoreya: straight up
[4:30:13] TheGiant99: Does it really matter at the end of the day where you rank
[4:30:18] Bernardo994: nothing we need to dps
[4:30:21] Buckwink: @TheGiant99 yes
[4:30:25] Tumb3r: =)

[4:30:29] DrakeDuude: agreed

[4:30:35] thatdanishguy666: Make it selfcast
[4:30:36] cellarrr: Self buff or get rid of it
[4:30:37] thatdanishguy666: EZ
[4:30:39] dym_jt: The problem is humans if you ask me, idiots, not PI.
[4:30:39] Thoreya: not a blizzard problem
[4:30:41] jin_woo_777: yup removing would legit be best
[4:30:43] Kale_Nd: or just transform it in a bloodlust
[4:30:43] pavepawns: what if we just buff power infusion to 100% :p
[4:30:43] pilltillkill: @TheGiant99 to people with nothing but a game to bring them any sense of self worth? yes

[4:30:47] maxlol: PI only usable on tanks
[4:30:49] maalow: selfcast or give a debuff
[4:30:49] Nevindaz: yea but keep in mid that evokers already are going to be op until they will "balance" jk .. and wlcls, mages.. etc will need to have something extra to keep up
[4:30:51] ThaOriginalGamester: I'm on the competitive wow reddit, reading this thread lol
[4:30:52] Qluranpapier: just make it raidwide
[4:30:57] tebbix: PepeHands music
[4:31:02] Rizwan1337: make it raid wide with 10% of the power
[4:31:05] Kisswani: make it lower the DPS of the one get infused and call it a " bug " and never fix it
[4:31:05] P4RT1CLEM4N: @maxlol Lol
[4:31:08] VitochieR1: People like comparing to see where they match up in the world. Idk I think it’s fun and helps you improve to be better
[4:31:10] tronbadgames: @Towelliee turn PI into a super short duration raid wide buff.. problem solved
[4:31:12] Xindii: the great purge GandalfPls
[4:31:16] TheGiant99: Maybe players should leave the ego at the door
[4:31:16] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee what if they just made it party or raid wde for 20secs so everybody is happy and use it inbetween lust?
[4:31:19] Buckwink: the cons outweigh the pros
[4:31:20] manmower: make it self-cast only
[4:31:20] Rayao: blizzard made a fun supprtive spell, rankings made it a problem :)
[4:31:22] Frank4LuLz: bring back totems
[4:31:26] TheRukis: @Towelliee but why do ppl care so much..
[4:31:27] tronbadgames: mini BL
[4:31:33] firemangg123: dude pogchamp i love it
[4:31:34] Oatu: Oatu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[4:31:35] Kisswani: mini lust
[4:31:35] JRobezzz: I just think the Priest should also get the effect, I think it's unfair if they don't.
[4:31:36] nexusg4miing: making a survey post about it is the problem
[4:31:37] Bernardo994: yea
[4:31:38] Rexialiton: That's a giga parse nerd problem
[4:31:38] Thoreya: idk thats a player problem to me homie
[4:31:43] MrFuzzynuts420: yeah
[4:31:44] SirVoro: PogChamp LUST 2 POWERED INFUSALO
[4:31:45] thatdanishguy666: ah yes.... more raid buffs
[4:31:49] Kale_Nd: just make it a lust and make it give sated @Towelliee
[4:31:51] VitochieR1: Lmao raid wide
[4:31:57] ztilleto: yeah, and the out it on the bl counter.. problem solved.
[4:31:58] PvtHudson093: yes
[4:32:03] israelihomeboy: They gave their thoughts on PI in an interview yesterday
[4:32:07] VitochieR1: I’m fine if it’s just a priest thing tbh
[4:32:08] Nevindaz: it would be awesome if it will be group wide mathilShake
[4:32:08] CaptainAlkohol: make it 5% raidwide with a global cooldown for 2min
[4:32:13] zgag: There could be a debuff that stay on the PI buffed player for 10 mins.  That way the same person doesn't get multiple PI
[4:32:15] Buckwink: my parses got me into a M raiding guild from an AOTC guild
[4:32:16] Molvonos: Raid positions live and die based on parses
[4:32:17] Keefferr: yeah they dont care about your logs
[4:32:21] Buckwink: it def matters
[4:32:21] pavepawns: what if instead of removing pi they give a new satiated effect on the person u used it on last lasting 4 mins
[4:32:23] abracka_: if it's raid wide, it should be considered a exhaustion w 10 min cd
[4:32:31] Buckwink: @Keefferr guilds do
[4:32:33] manmower: why argue about PI in a world where warlock tuning exists?
[4:32:34] SethRonin: Healing parses get so skewed
[4:32:37] Nevindaz: imagine and evoker dev with bl and pi KEKW
[4:32:37] Maneguster: I mean mostly the same classes get PI any way if you compare top parses for Dk. Top Dk has 0 but second has 4 locks at the top are all 6-8
[4:32:41] ShowDUH: it's not only about parsing tho there's a lot of background discussion in guild about how to handle it and just waste a lot of time outside of raid hours and stuff to just plan it out
[4:32:43] Fab2k: facts
[4:32:48] Buckwink: if you think parses dont matter then you obviously dont raid mythic
[4:32:49] RiskyBusines_ez: i think its a good poll
[4:32:50] Keefferr: @Buckwink dont play if you dont like it
[4:33:04] thatdanishguy666: I wonder how RaidBots will handle the new talent tree
[4:33:09] Molvonos: Demo Lock only did remotely as good as it did because of PI
[4:33:12] Epiclurker27893: So remove a choice because players are afraid of making the choice? Players will then complain about the loss of the choice.
[4:33:20] zgag: Lot of pug leaders will look at logs, but never look for PI logs. It can make a difference for pugs
[4:33:20] paravak: They're pandering to that crowd though, its not necessary for them to do that
[4:33:28] TechNinja20: I 'd go with option 4 tbh
[4:33:36] manmower: which regions are doing the PI stacking cheese?
[4:33:37] ShowDUH: @thatdanishguy666 there's no other borrowed power it'S gonna be easy to do
[4:33:45] Buckwink: the top parser is always some dude with 6 pi buffs
[4:33:56] rohdey: i miss my prot pala w/ TD
[4:34:00] puna_notno: @Towelliee Maybe do like FFXIV as long as you don't flame other players with parse SE does nothing but if you start flaming ot whatever they suspend/ban you
[4:34:04] fatherfrag: Give us tanks Twilight Dev as a talent PLZ??
[4:34:04] sshadeh: @Towelliee and even people with same corruption did different damage because RNG
[4:34:05] bobbyg24k: Twilight devastation for the win
[4:34:06] CaptainAlkohol: secret
[4:34:09] VitochieR1: Lmao true corruption was fun while it lasted but chaotic
[4:34:16] Mudwax: knut2Head
[4:34:32] zemmek: @Towelliee Do we know what level Dractyr with start at?
[4:34:33] JRobezzz: I think PI should always effect the priest who casted it, but maybe make it have a debuff on the other player to not be able to recast that combat
[4:34:35] thatdanishguy666: @Showduh Yeah but all the different combinations that you would have to sim to get the best result would be quite high
[4:34:41] sshadeh: @VitochieR1 to me it was just "end of expansion, balance doesnt matter, go wild"
[4:34:58] Kanylekurt: Man give me back 300%+ CDR through corruptions..
[4:34:59] manmower: why make a change to the game based on some external website?
[4:35:16] lithium364: whatch paladins getting the night fae buffs too kekw
[4:35:23] MisterBongwater: It’s a great idea that the players ruin
[4:35:25] nexusg4miing: .1 percent
[4:35:30] tronbadgames: @Towelliee PI should buff the caster + a % to the whole raid.
[4:35:35] Eraste: ya im with ion on this one
[4:35:42] Austei: lol
[4:35:43] manmower: they should just make an ingame leaderboard and it doesn't count PI
[4:35:43] dym_jt: As I said, humans are the problem, not PI, people are idiots and we're making a another change for the 0.1 percent.
[4:35:46] pavepawns: nah let them have it
[4:35:51] Velashen: Making the game focusing esport caused it.
[4:35:58] rymerre: they should just make a damn game...forget all this background shit
[4:36:01] pavepawns: i trust my priests
[4:36:01] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[4:36:01] hasan666: "party buff". It is a single person buff. how about make PI raid wide
[4:36:03] Thdlock: single player buffs suck either get rid of it or make it raidwide and make the value alot less while making the player who casted it get the full value
[4:36:19] generaljosh721: just nerf PI and dont make it castable on allies
[4:36:20] Thdlock: some specs with and without pi feel worlds different
[4:36:21] Morpheusx25: @Thdlock ^
[4:36:22] Boltex: no
[4:36:23] Kisswani: LUL no
[4:36:24] ZetYokai: what a load of shit
[4:36:24] copterskates: KEKW
[4:36:25] Austei: i do
[4:36:26] strike879: i agree with the make it raidwide crowd with a diffrent debuff
[4:36:26] Thasin22: its a player problem so just leave it how it is
[4:36:26] Molvonos: lol no
[4:36:28] Austei: just cuase
[4:36:28] Nevindaz: yea me only KEKW
[4:36:28] Rayao: make PI full value on the user and 5-10% on the PARTY or something :) make it a mine group lust
[4:36:29] TechNinja20: NO LMAO
[4:36:30] Chum964: Sunking I think sometimes?
[4:36:32] manmower: no you usually want to PI the best melee
[4:36:32] Gitmm: pi the tank
[4:36:32] raye_gaming22: tis guy is out of tauch
[4:36:32] ZetYokai: theyre literally coming up with bullshit
[4:36:33] crittinkitten: I PI'd myself as a healer
[4:36:35] raye_gaming22: PI healer HAHAHA
[4:36:40] Austei: i like to piss off dps
[4:36:44] copterskates: @Towelliee as a healer i pay my priests for PI every raid so DPS doesnt get them
[4:36:46] Austei: :)
[4:36:46] ThaOriginalGamester: that's why people hated corruption.  so butthurt about logs
[4:36:54] nevrowz: arena
[4:36:55] flebbooo: Only time i got PI a healer was for Sun king mythic as mistweaver KEKW
[4:37:04] Thdlock: it should be a mini raid lust like 3% haste raidwide or gone completely single player buffs sucks
[4:37:10] buttsnake12: Lol
[4:37:12] VitochieR1: Honestly just either keep tracking the buff in logs or have a separate log for pi
[4:37:16] Jereico: you had it the first time
[4:37:20] Voidheim: extra anus
[4:37:21] hasan666: I am a priest healer. I self PI idgaf
[4:37:23] Eraste: theres no borrowed popwer so people have to get pissed about something else
[4:37:23] generaljosh721: extray-knee-us
[4:37:29] Akermay: ex-tray-knee-us
[4:37:29] procyon_mfc: I've been gone for a year, what is power infusion?
[4:37:47] buttsnake12: Priest skill
[4:37:52] manmower: PI should have a haste buff and be followed by a haste penalty, so it provides the burst window but makes your parse overall lower
[4:37:56] Kisswani: hot potato handed to Warcraft logs
[4:37:59] Thdlock: dark intent KEKW
[4:38:00] sshadeh: Just make it work on the priest itself, easy
[4:38:06] raye_gaming22: hysteria
[4:38:08] zomboo420: making it a mini raid buff would be dope
[4:38:08] Kisswani: make it only work on warlocks
[4:38:09] lithium364: bring back hysteria
[4:38:11] TeaJae2x: who cares lmfaooooo folks crying over a buff
[4:38:15] abracka_: unholy frenzy now i think
[4:38:16] zomboo420: or maybe per party?
[4:38:17] VitochieR1: @thdlock then won’t there just be more priest healer stacks
[4:38:20] TheRukis: that druid ability
[4:38:24] Keefferr: yeah its hilarious @TeaJae2x
[4:38:24] dalaraz: hysteria to unholy frenzy
[4:38:24] nelorixx: Unholy frenzy yea
[4:38:26] UlsterFarl: This is on par with the bitching about Oakensoul ring in ESO
[4:38:33] dalaraz: then there was symbiosis
[4:38:38] plate_of_food: @Athlarc ooooh boy LUL
[4:38:45] BigDP: symbiosis
[4:38:50] raye_gaming22: and the other shit  dank simlactum that oneshoted raid bosses
[4:38:55] Blyzerx: Pvp talenttt itt :P
[4:38:55] buttsnake12: Shaman hero in arena
[4:38:57] cpt_flamingo7: if only logs removed the parses part the game whould be 50% better instantly
[4:38:58] Syborc: for saying, "who cares" u actually do care really much @Towelliee
[4:39:03] brewboii: i mean its like Symbiosis and they took that away because if made some classes broken
[4:39:08] ShowDUH: Yeah and that's a lot of pain to plan out
[4:39:10] CyonDru: its used for prog to clear shit but then on parse runs its gets rampoant lol
[4:39:12] manmower: fluff article
[4:39:13] Thdlock: i think it sucks when my class plays completely diff with and without it
[4:39:16] SoniicFusion: Just make it put a debuff on player for like 5 minutes so the same person can’t keep receiving it
[4:39:17] Jereico: I don't think most people even care about the guys getting it 9 times in a pull
[4:39:24] Nevindaz: KEKW
[4:39:25] AveragePvp: Remove it
[4:39:26] Jereico: It is a big issue for warlock and priest players right now in general
[4:39:26] Thdlock: like for fire mage with and without its insnae
[4:39:28] Khalus90: parsing should have no bearing on the game design
[4:39:38] terror_reidey: just make it a priest only buff domt remove it wtf
[4:39:38] Rexialiton: Let's do that
[4:39:40] Keefferr: @Khalus90 agreed
[4:39:43] apb89: Delete PI
[4:39:45] Jereico: Agree Thd
[4:39:51] terror_reidey: keep it on priest only*
[4:39:52] CyonDru: should be nerfed to 15% haste or be self cast only, thoughts? @Towelliee @Thdlock
[4:39:53] Buckwink: some people have fun doing pet battles and it doesnt effect me negatively so let it be
[4:39:54] TheGiant99: Its just a player ego thing
[4:39:55] Boltex: i play ww monk so PI is irelevant EZ
[4:39:58] raye_gaming22: @Thdlock true fire mage with and without PI  are worlds
[4:39:58] manmower: PI is good for pvp
[4:39:58] Izaclaz: just give a debuff like forbearance 5min
[4:40:00] truman0725: and I mean that's fair enough
[4:40:04] VitochieR1: Don’t remove it. Just make it bound to only the priest themselves
[4:40:13] apb89: Just make it a self buff to be honest
[4:40:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:40:21] UlsterFarl: Outside influence is cancer.  doesn't take into account the majority of players
[4:40:25] CyonDru: PI should be nerfed at the very least by 10%
[4:40:28] Buckwink: @Izaclaz good idea
[4:40:33] aladinsane444: Solution is easy - buff PI (when u use it, its effect is applied to all players in the group)
[4:40:33] nevrowz: sick !!!
[4:40:36] Buckwink: as a Hunter this is good
[4:40:40] Dathas487: Pretty solid first tier look
[4:40:43] rohdey: ice bijrd
[4:40:46] SethRonin: The mage on is pretty baller
[4:40:46] tehbobbstah: It's all so bulky tough
[4:40:48] tehbobbstah: though*
[4:40:49] abracka_: the helm looks like the skull of a chocobo to me lmao
[4:40:53] Macroversal_: looks like a boomkin
[4:41:01] Buckwink: now make the bow/gun match
[4:41:02] Leystra: dem massive shoulders tho
[4:41:04] karter2811: a red one would be nice
[4:41:07] ijuki: Tier in the first raid? Is that normal?
[4:41:08] tehbobbstah: @Macroversal_ aw man it's literally a boombkin
[4:41:09] jin_woo_777: I would be parsing if it was an even playing-field. they lose a potential subscriber for not catering to the folk that play to parse. im sure there are more like me
[4:41:18] Rudric_Ice: first time seeing a mail set look this good
[4:41:25] Nevindaz: stone eaggle KEKW
[4:41:33] psycothedruid: The problem with PI isn't some people getting it and some people not, the people that whine about that probably whine about other stuff. The real problem with PI is it causes classes to get nerfed (like Warlock) when they don't need to be because it's PI making them insane, that's an entirely different balancing issue though
[4:41:34] hasan666: so it is a mail set?
[4:41:37] lithium364: the evoker tier set looked sick on stevens stream
[4:41:39] pavepawns: i like that hunter set
[4:41:42] raye_gaming22: i just hope you dudes voted the right shit to ban PI from allstars
[4:41:45] strike879: colour version and difficulty version really got the thats normal and concept is mythic vibes
[4:41:49] plate_of_food: looks like a shammy
[4:41:49] Bimmer535: yuk
[4:41:50] Chum964: Rogues is so strange to me. It's just so bulky
[4:41:57] Thasin22: if anything needs removed from the game its Feral and boomkin.
[4:41:58] almostdps: its just a dif color scheme
[4:41:58] UlsterFarl: Cant stealth to much with that glow
[4:42:00] jeflag: they all look like shaman pieces
[4:42:01] Nevindaz: every armour are stone type KEKW
[4:42:02] Chum964: As a rogue main I hate it haha. Too bulky
[4:42:10] Nevindaz: what cloth or plate KEKW
[4:42:12] roxtempo: wtf is this
[4:42:13] Poriand: not a fan
[4:42:13] abracka_: the demon hunter set made me want to switch mains
[4:42:14] roxtempo: KEKW
[4:42:17] cudlsac: Asmon said the same thing
[4:42:19] Human_Variant: double PI effects I want to drown in the elitist tears
[4:42:20] arai_x3: they should stop showing them on male human if it doesnt fit the concept art
[4:42:23] cudlsac: shammy pieces
[4:42:26] manmower: it's lit
[4:42:31] roxtempo: OMG
[4:42:35] Nevindaz: yep
[4:42:36] this_reformed_bird: shaman is amazing
[4:42:38] roxtempo: THE BEST
[4:42:38] Buckwink: yeah that is so Shaman
[4:42:39] Jereico: @araigumaX3 i honestly hate every set on the human male frame lol
[4:42:42] rolando415: yea the shammy one is awesome
[4:42:42] norasalom: dh?^^
[4:42:42] manmower: because they used an orc
[4:42:43] AveragePvp: Rock shaman Pog
[4:42:44] Khalus90: that is class specific thats why
[4:42:44] Nevindaz: a bit 2 much stones but KEKW
[4:42:51] zildrog: i like it yeah
[4:42:57] Buckwink: MORE STONE
[4:42:58] SouvlakiTheBest: waist looks like pumbers
[4:42:58] plate_of_food: looks good
[4:42:59] Miklagart: this is a shaman
[4:43:01] Kisswani: a good mail transmog ??? not my WoW danMad
[4:43:04] Mallaes: 3/10 too much stones
[4:43:05] hasan666: shaman = earth elements
[4:43:06] AveragePvp: Yeah this lore wise is a nail on the head for a tier set
[4:43:06] Zynarch: That looks good
[4:43:09] aladinsane444: Rock solid
[4:43:10] Nevindaz: look at him he barrely moves KEKW
[4:43:10] abracka_: earthwarden shaman towLets towGo

[4:43:22] Zynarch: Rock solid 10/10
[4:43:23] fluffk1n: all this stone and still no tank spec
[4:43:25] SethRonin: did you like the mage?
[4:43:33] sifer007: allset looks like shaman set
[4:43:36] ottavianni: the rock set
[4:43:38] AveragePvp: @fluffk1n true sadge
[4:43:55] Nevindaz: idk but the deign style of the sets looks a lot with the draenor ones
[4:43:56] x614x_engineer: do they have a date for this expansion release? @ chat
[4:44:26] ShowDUH: @x614x_engineer 2022
[4:44:26] Macroversal_: Soon tm
[4:44:28] hasan666: she is a force ghost
[4:44:29] ShowDUH: nothing else
[4:44:33] Snup78: she look like a blood elf to me KAppa
[4:44:38] Snup78: Kappa
[4:44:42] lynixxis: chua
[4:44:51] Khalus90: simulacrum so its not real
[4:44:55] jeflag: arthas used to mount her all day and she forgot
[4:44:57] UlsterFarl: Lich Kings steed.  Invincible has left the chat.
[4:45:10] WadeWilson: March 2023
[4:45:18] TheRukis: on or before dec 31st
[4:45:26] OviTheGray: whould sindragosa react to the icc vanquisher mount?
[4:45:36] Snup78: @OviTheGray KEKW
[4:45:38] Dathas487: California also has wicked harsh laws in regards to breaking "release by" dates
[4:45:38] Kisswani: then the crunch is gonna be horrible
[4:45:52] Rowini30: welcome to crunch land
[4:45:53] UlsterFarl: If all zones are actually done to the same level etc I think we will see Early December and then the Raid in Jan 23
[4:45:54] Gr3atAp3: they need the winter time off activity bro
[4:45:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sales are best in Q4
[4:45:59] Miklagart: but are the people that pre ordered not the people that wuold not care if the game would be delayed?
[4:46:02] Khalus90: cyberpunk did
[4:46:08] happyspot: maybe 10s of millions but that's enough
[4:46:11] Darzetti_: prob a littel bit of everything
[4:46:12] Snup78: @Miklagart Right
[4:46:12] UlsterFarl: Id say billions in stock not refunds
[4:46:14] N3llee: cost associated with issuing refunds
[4:46:17] Miklagart: they would play anyway
[4:46:22] SilkeySmooth: estimated sales?
[4:46:25] BoltonSquad: You've gotta think though they've had Proletariat developers on payroll for the past 3 month as well, I think they'll hit the mark for this year.
[4:46:26] Alienfromger: maybe reputatin loss
[4:46:34] WoWRoach: Who would get a refund just to buy it 3 months later?
[4:46:36] ambiotic: 10s of millions to a billion dollar company is nothing
[4:46:37] generaljosh721: I think its mostly because they invested all of the money they received from the refunds so now they're in the hole
[4:46:40] kashmara: why would people refund  ? If it's coming out say Feb 23 instead of Nov 22, people ... refund?
[4:46:43] N3llee: warcaraft 3 got a lot fo refunds
[4:46:49] Khalus90: want there a diablo 3 problem back in the day in australia or korea?
[4:46:53] Khalus90: wasn't
[4:46:55] UlsterFarl: @Alienfromger exactly rep and brand image would be the issue.
[4:46:56] Miklagart: no I also dont think they would
[4:46:56] Buckwink: there are causals in oribos right now saying Shadowlands is a good expansion KEKW
[4:47:00] TnTsKyHiGh: I wouldn't refund
[4:47:01] procyon_mfc: WoW players are pretty dedicated - it's the subs that go up and down
[4:47:01] poorhooligans: as if tens of millions have preordered this - no way
[4:47:02] krick864: just get it right and im happy
[4:47:02] moon_ty: I play anyway; why would I refund^^
[4:47:03] Jereico: No one's gonna refund, they'll just make a salty post on Discord about it
[4:47:11] WoWRoach: Oh, we'd care, but not going to get a refund.
[4:47:14] Miklagart: we are already waiting. we can wait for a finished game
[4:47:16] Aegisreaver: I dont think people would care due to christmas
[4:47:18] OrgusDC: If the devs are honest and communicate no one will care.
[4:47:18] Tizbit: theyd refund just to re pre order
[4:47:19] truman0725: nah just release it ready and I'm good, could always play something else meanwhile
[4:47:19] sliproach: they are more likelt to give out free game time if the delay not refund so you just buy it again a munth later
[4:47:21] geokouts: 10 refund which means 10mil people refunded!
[4:47:22] akuma_46: more time to play woltk
[4:47:22] kashmara: Maybe us boomers don't care, lol.
[4:47:23] SeckSymbols: The brand image cant get any worse than it did last year
[4:47:25] wastedxtime93: cant make shareholders unhappy
[4:47:27] Snup78: if they refund are they taking back the drake ? D:
[4:47:30] psycothedruid: the only reason I haven't preordered is because work gives me a gaming budget that I'm def gonna use to buy the physical collector's edition and I get it in like 9 days so...
[4:47:32] zelph_: I wouldnt refund..  I think they should delay the game
[4:47:33] strike879: the players prob wouldnt care the investors prob will
[4:47:48] hasan666: People could refund out of frustration but then re-order it once released KEKW
[4:47:49] MrDoucheBagel: @Towelliee When is Microsoft getting ownership of Blizzard?
[4:47:50] Rudric_Ice: Tow u wanna see the other class sets ? i got links
[4:47:52] pavepawns: chug chug chug
[4:48:00] Malnar1123: It's also just become expected for games to get delayed now...I really think the days of genuine massive uproar (not just the vocal minority) are over.
[4:48:09] psycothedruid: @MrDoucheBagel they said it'll probably be 2024 already, lots of stuff to clean up
[4:48:14] Kisswani: Not sure if I read right , but I think FTC now has 30 days to approve the Microsoft acquisition or request more answers or something like that
[4:48:25] roxtempo: AHAHHAHAH
[4:48:28] SeckSymbols: @psycothedruid The deal will likely close mid next year
[4:48:28] roxtempo: 90%
[4:48:31] generaljosh721: thats true at almost any company
[4:48:32] PvtHudson093: november
[4:48:35] Dathas487: 11/29 is the release date SS it
[4:48:36] zgag: Blizzard could come out and simply say they are extending testing because they don't fell DF is where it needs to be.  That could be Blizzards fallback if DF gets delayed
[4:48:39] UlsterFarl: I'd be shocked if raid released before Jan 23
[4:48:45] happyspot: xpack early/mid december raids after new years?
[4:48:45] zgag: feel *
[4:48:55] Moobot: Nevindaz, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[4:49:00] UlsterFarl: Ear ly December release and delayed raid sounds right
[4:49:00] Khalus90: nighthold was a while
[4:49:01] roxtempo: Celldweller - I CANT WAIT
[4:49:03] Jereico: I still do think a mid-late Jaunary raid is the best for everyone
[4:49:03] sliproach: between thanks giving and first weeks of december
[4:49:05] SeckSymbols: If what Ion said is correct and that they are well ahead of any other point in any other alpha/beta test before, then it could hit this year easily
[4:49:09] rymerre: so why dont they plan for that time off?
[4:49:15] Cranxjs: people will just wasting time with dragonriding ;D
[4:49:18] Dathas487: Just two weeks to level alts and shit before Season 1 begins, a delay in Season 1 starting is NOT a bad thing.
[4:49:21] MaleFrom73: or just wait 5 weeks to sub
[4:49:22] Poriand: im down for a longer pre patch and longer time before raid
[4:49:22] Nevindaz: look aT diablo a completely gotcha mobile game and they miled milions of $ just in the first month KEKW
[4:49:23] psycothedruid: @SeckSymbols true but idk if the actual integration will happen before then, my previous company acquired Levis and we closed the deal but didn't integrate for 372 days after closing
[4:49:25] RiskyBusines_ez: Castle Nathria was during december, world first was 23th
[4:49:28] quentinkil: hi how are you
[4:49:30] rymerre: sounds like they dont
[4:49:31] Vendralos: Would we have mythic dungeons?
[4:49:32] pavepawns: i dont mind a delayed raid if we get expac early december
[4:49:32] manmower: just tune the raid really high for during xmas break
[4:49:38] Shirey36: why release games in dec if they know they are going on vaca all dec :P
[4:49:38] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[4:49:40] Thasin22: didnt they just hire a bunch of ppl?
[4:49:42] roxtempo: @quentinkil im fine thanks
[4:49:43] psycothedruid: think it depends on their contract and such
[4:49:43] truman0725: I feel like it's a good thing if it would be delayed, especially for us semi casual raiders
[4:49:44] SilkeySmooth: people can level their alts during that time
[4:49:47] Khalus90: covid time too
[4:49:47] zgag: They could always have the pre-patch with all the new talents/ Evoker with some stuff left out
[4:49:50] WoWRoach: I work for a software company too, we don't officially close at the holidays, but it's a very skeleton crew.
[4:49:54] Poriand: big question do we get evoker in pre patch?
[4:50:04] Kale_Nd: @Poriand yes
[4:50:05] SeckSymbols: @Poriand Yes
[4:50:06] ShowDUH: @Poriand yes
[4:50:09] Carahail: @Poriand yes
[4:50:09] pavepawns: if raid is delayed means i can take it chill at tstart and get alts
[4:50:11] Poriand: <3
[4:50:14] Jereico: Releasing the raid just before Christmas kinda sucks for most raiding guilds anyway
[4:50:17] psycothedruid: @WoWRoach my job doesn't have a schedule but they make sure we disconnect on holidays, it's v nice of them
[4:50:18] paravak: And i'm sure all 10 people who play ESO cared greatly lmao
[4:50:27] Jereico: Even if they did technically finish the Race to World First just before
[4:50:30] ashwing_: But they are doing it different style now?
[4:50:37] Khalus90: dracthyr probs in pre patch too
[4:50:38] SeckSymbols: Proletariat being acquired helps on the QA side
[4:50:39] Poriand: im hyped lol
[4:50:42] im_n0t_jezus: they probably working overtime now to make it happen
[4:50:42] Nerendis: Are they ahead though?
[4:50:43] Hawkseye: They said they could release BfA a month early because they were so far ahead. It's a joke
[4:50:44] Tizbit: still dont even have all the trees done.. classes are the like the minimum that needs to be done
[4:50:46] Shatraugh: its gonna be a shit show obviously
[4:50:49] thenormalbeast: Ian said dedicated feedback only trees, for example
[4:50:53] Shirey36: lets be real we know how it ends LUL
[4:50:57] pheals: 3 weeks lmao im happy i get 2 days off
[4:50:59] Akermay: They said they have a completely different plan this time. new zone every week
[4:51:00] pavepawns: i mean we will learn alot these upcoming 4 weeks where they will be putting out each zone and more talent trees
[4:51:01] thatsmybis: Im just concerned about gameplay outside of raids and m+. Dragon riding is a fun gimmick but it's not enough of a "selling" point
[4:51:01] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:51:03] PvtHudson093: Blizz needs to factor in time to fix anything the community brings up like Azerite Armour
[4:51:07] UlsterFarl: Even early November for pre patch.  They could manage it but I think they are sure on what they are delivering.   Not much time to pivot and change things if needed.
[4:51:09] StoicTaurus: Don't you think current Alpha is equal to typical Alpha after 2 months ?
[4:51:12] RealSolaroid: Didn't they say that they've been working on Dragonflight since before Shadowlands?
[4:51:14] psycothedruid: This is the smoothest alpha launch I remember so I really think they're okay aside from probably getting raids/dungeons done
[4:51:16] SeckSymbols: They should do a bigger beta, more people = more testing
[4:51:27] hasan666: wut
[4:51:29] TheRukis: i hope so
[4:51:30] Nokterian: @Towelliee https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-isnt-being-designed-for-players-obsessed-with-topping-dps-meters/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social
[4:51:33] Kooznik: @PvtHudson093 there is no random shit like azerite armor, necklace, leggos
[4:51:34] psycothedruid: @SeckSymbols I think they should do a "if you preordered you get beta" thing
[4:51:40] ShowDUH: @RealSolaroid that's an always thing tho
[4:51:41] psycothedruid: it would be a huge help
[4:51:45] Poriand: i think they will add more people in alpha/beta it already kinda seems that way
[4:51:48] manmower: way more focus on casual players
[4:51:57] ShowDUH: every xpac is started before an expac
[4:51:57] zgag: ion mentioned that this testing is different than previous tests.  Where they are going to focus on certain zone/zones each test cycle.  Closing down 1 zone and opening a new one.
[4:52:03] Gr3atAp3: + talents
[4:52:07] PvtHudson093: s1 affix
[4:52:16] Rudric_Ice: they acquired 100 new employees so i think they got more QA testers now
[4:52:19] Nevindaz: the evoker KEKW
[4:52:22] pavepawns: next week we get dracthyr start zone i think?
[4:52:23] abracka_: guys i know what's happening. ion is the main person in his raiding guild getting PI'd
[4:52:26] psycothedruid: @PvtHudson093 they said the affix is going to be a lot simpler, at least Ion hinted at that
[4:52:26] pavepawns: or it was the plains
[4:52:33] CorruptArkangel: They could have a great expansion on their hands and why they want to rush it out this year when we’ve experience so many unfinished broken game releases in recent years, blows my mind
[4:52:35] Nevindaz: I think that evoker will be so op on both specs
[4:52:36] Khalus90: he said talents are mostly gonna be the main testing thing
[4:52:37] madhatterui: new talent trees
[4:52:43] tronbadgames: @Towelliee thats all targetable though, it's not like they are behind with the art or something that just takes tons of time.
[4:52:46] Nokterian: 38 talent tree's that is including evoker now
[4:52:53] xoto: People have absolutely no idea how much work game development is
[4:52:54] SeckSymbols: New classes every week for testing is good
[4:52:56] cordawg: professions are the only thing to balance
[4:52:57] jarilrpg: no borrowed power just means balancing "should" be easier
[4:53:00] Kisswani: towCopium
[4:53:01] Khalus90: they might want to hide quests/lore
[4:53:06] Rudric_Ice: evokers feels bad in pvp
[4:53:10] Naturecold: What if this is a situation like Fox had when Marvel was trying to buy is library. Push out all your unfinished projects because they are going in a different direction.
[4:53:17] manmower: dragonriding seemed like it would be the least complete feature
[4:53:20] TheGiant99: No matter when and or how the game releases people will bitch and complain
[4:53:31] procyon_mfc: pcgamer article?
[4:53:31] raye_gaming22: i mean Ion doubled down on 2022 in 2 interviews
[4:53:33] UlsterFarl: From what I have seen of Alpha it is polished more than wee have seen in previous expansions.  They do seem to be further ahead than in the past.
[4:53:34] WadeWilson: Clap
[4:53:41] fluffk1n: i see it as the game is ready but the tuning of all the classes arent so thats going to be the majority of the testing for the next 4 months
[4:53:43] xendros78: if they plan to do all this focused testing in a short amount of time the waves of testing invites need to match that estimated speed
[4:53:57] PvtHudson093: what clickbait
[4:53:58] psycothedruid: it really wouldn't surprise me if we actually got an earlier-than-Dec 31st release date
[4:54:01] Nevindaz: Kappa
[4:54:01] rbsk212: @towelliee do you have any plans to test out evoker healer in alpha testing
[4:54:03] Luxicake: omg that fox wyvern is so cute
[4:54:10] Angxlic: terrible title
[4:54:15] ProfessorChaoos: Does this mean wotlk and dragonflight are going to release near eachother? I was hoping to play both
[4:54:16] Rudric_Ice: u wanna see the DK set towellie ?
[4:54:19] UlsterFarl: All article titles are click bait now days
[4:54:25] psycothedruid: unless they specifically wait until Dec 31 to avoid a holiday race to world first and AWC
[4:54:33] cordawg: Good! and now remove all combat addons.  they make the game worse!
[4:54:40] Nokterian: CHAD DRAGON
[4:54:43] Jereico: ducks!
[4:54:51] nexusg4miing: DPS meters are the only good thing in wow
[4:54:51] StraightErro: That 2nd one should have been the male dracthyr, like male draenei
[4:54:52] Klarynse: dang
[4:54:58] Rudric_Ice: THIS IS the DRACTHYR BODY 5 WE NEED
[4:54:58] letdownlarry: That's sick
[4:55:00] Nevindaz: towCopium balanced classes huh
[4:55:01] isseidahk: he knows his lights are off right?
[4:55:01] Molvonos: towCry towCry
[4:55:04] sshadeh: why cant the playable ones look like that wtf
[4:55:06] raye_gaming22: @cordawg classic is this way >>>
[4:55:09] sshadeh: need a chad dragon
[4:55:13] thatsmybis: Could easily have been warriors
[4:55:17] Gr3atAp3: feels like that existing alongside dracthyr is literally a shot fired by blizz
[4:55:18] zomboo420: that's how the male dragons should look
[4:55:19] SouvlakiTheBest: yes please
[4:55:20] thatsmybis: just a single class race
[4:55:20] pavepawns: dracthyr tank right there
[4:55:22] Nokterian: need gigachad dragon
[4:55:25] DubakuMatumbo: Yoooo this is how dracthyr should look like sadge @towelliee ain’t nobody wanna play a scuffed lizard KEKW
[4:55:26] Nevindaz: yep .. idk why they didnt add a tank spec on evoker
[4:55:27] porowozek: and we got to play humanoid toad =(
[4:55:28] Buckwink: that looks amazing please let me be that
[4:55:32] Human_Variant: true combat add-ons shouldn't be a thing. they should design encounters better
[4:55:33] Mr_Pennywise_: towLets towGo towHype
[4:55:34] Nevindaz: why not
[4:55:36] K4ykay: Those models look like roided out chads
[4:55:39] manmower: couldn't fit all the armor around the model at the correct resolution
[4:55:39] Nevindaz: look at guradian
[4:55:42] thatsmybis: they look goofy
[4:55:45] UlsterFarl: Dracthyr is needing a tank.   I mean they are Dragons should be tanky as hell.
[4:55:48] SensationalBanana: Players whinge for years about wanting less brodude body types and then when it happens whinges to no end about not enough brodude... -_-
[4:55:52] PhoenixAuTv: @Towelliee im soo sad tho. No dragon tank. forever crying
[4:55:53] madhatterui: @Towelliee you think they'll ever do a melee animation update?
[4:56:11] RoboMaximillion: i don't need all my bodies to look like refrigerators
[4:56:23] SouvlakiTheBest: yes please again
[4:56:29] Rudric_Ice: @RoboMaximillion  i do

[6:02:27] Kylesten450: But hogger is a low lvl mob so you would expect him not to look too crazy and the mobs to progressively look more amazing the higher lvl you get, this coming from a new play POV, from old players i can see it can be annoying
