[1:18:55] Shezzmou: DH doing 170k dps
[1:19:14] heymomimonttv: lock doing 100k dps is pretty crazy too
[1:19:17] pisceslonewolf: The rogue must be trolling. Rogue could shutdown lots of the DH dmg
[1:19:27] StromicusRex: rogue playing with his toes
[1:19:28] moldybread00: @venruki  pres is stil a little alien to me, im having fun on dev but i wanna heal too. Can you give me like a quick TLDR on what the healing goals are?

[1:20:11] Schnellmusic: Yeah Cdew manages to do 200k hps and 100k dps simultaneously
[1:20:13] Bronloch: CDew does make good guides
[1:20:15] moldybread00: yeah but chuck dosent have the effortlessly salon hair that u do... nice beard tho

[1:20:20] ExylTheElf: @happyheals BRING BACK THE WOW DEW
[1:20:21] happyheals: don't buy stuff when you're drunk
[1:20:30] happyheals: I am gonna own it all

[1:21:17] chubmax: @venruki when dh on ur team can we see talents
[1:21:31] moldybread00: i wish pres got instant flames off fire breath dmg like dev lol
[1:21:40] StromicusRex: i think this is the best iteration of green lizard
[1:22:07] JSaucy_v1: weird, the rogue actually goes the warlock and the warlock dies
[1:22:24] chubmax: yeah hes using that new build mvq was using
[1:22:26] pisceslonewolf: He has completely different talents to the last Dredh guy
[1:22:27] chubmax: insane ST
[1:22:33] DeityRevert: it's the new build
[1:22:33] happyheals: all I hear is nerf rdruid from people and dps doin stuff like that
[1:22:51] pisceslonewolf: Seems lke something I have to look into
[1:22:59] skarny1: i mean rdruid is ridiculous lol @happyheals
[1:23:12] Shezzmou: yeah all the DHs running a diff build it seems
[1:23:29] Shezzmou: no more decree
[1:23:58] happyheals: I know, I geared in 2s started at 2.2-2.4k mmr and got to 2k and I still have greens on
[1:24:00] Schnellmusic: LMAO
[1:24:08] primejusticegaming: eeek
[1:24:11] JSaucy_v1: lolol
[1:24:12] Kalliala: Heyyyy buddy venruki 🤩
[1:24:28] JSaucy_v1: rogue wanted to solo the hpal with 40k dps
[1:24:33] supatease: because u were the training wheels healer
[1:24:34] chubmax: @Shezzmou i want to try it out is it good?
[1:24:39] chubmax: it feels like less dps
[1:24:55] happyheals: Oh it is a rap god
[1:24:57] chubmax: more meta up;time
[1:25:04] Shezzmou: @chubmax not less dps when Tren and them do it
[1:25:23] Shezzmou: think you just gotta get used to it
[1:25:37] Doomsday_Sama: soz venruki, im tryna watch stream but these fucking ads are insnace, later
[1:25:38] chubmax: yeah i dont wanna practice it in shuffles
[1:25:42] kritikos5: @Shezzmou everyone is still playing decree? at least MVQ is
[1:25:42] chubmax: do i just do bg's and 2s lol
[1:25:51] pisceslonewolf: Anyone know where one can get the full "new build" for DH then? Just inspect?
[1:25:53] chubmax: nah they all swapped to new mvq one
[1:26:15] Shezzmou: @kritikos5 Tren was practicing it on stream but in SS and 3s he's still doing decree
[1:26:29] ALLtheEXP: @Doomsday_Sama just sub
[1:26:32] Shezzmou: i think he wasn't ready to blast it in rated stuff yet
[1:26:35] Kalliala: Hey I remember this video I made for u 4yrs ago its only like 5secs can I link here?
[1:26:41] bdonlv: hey ven what are some of the better classes/specs in pvp right now?
[1:26:44] kritikos5: @Shezzmou what even do they swap decree for? looking at the talent tree nothing really seems worth > dcree
[1:26:45] happyheals: @supatease I am watching your  new pvp tier list update. Have you done anything on rdruid since the 10.2 guide?
[1:26:50] ItsBees: !prime
[1:26:50] Moobot: @ItsBees rukiP Hey do you guys know about Twitch Prime? If you or someone you know has Amazon Prime, you can link it to your twitch account and sub to your favorite streamer (Venruki) for free!!! rukiP More info here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[1:27:23] chubmax: @Shezzmou the fury gen feels really bad
[1:27:51] raspador: @Doomsday_Sama pay for no add
[1:27:52] Shezzmou: @kritikos5 i haven't logged in to mess with it myself tbh. I think it's more like the old school eye beam build. Sorry i don't know the ins and outs yet.
[1:28:04] raspador: nothing is free
[1:28:08] chubmax: yeah thats what it is.  low cd eye beam for meta uptime
[1:28:11] chubmax: but u lack fury gen
[1:28:13] chubmax: and aoe
[1:28:30] pweepysonkun: the most twitch gives is 2mins, just go take a pee and come back
[1:28:49] happyheals: just always be killin pets for rage
[1:28:54] Devcomz: I just switch to a different browser when I get long ads
[1:28:58] Devcomz: works everytime
[1:29:17] fenris_06: LOL
[1:29:18] Shezzmou: @chubmax so like it used to be completely. More of a build and blast then just constant pressure.
[1:29:32] chubmax: yeah idk if its good for SS
[1:29:35] Kalliala: Can I do links here or nah?
[1:29:37] chubmax: probs way better for high rated 3s

[1:30:48] gamerdadhooper: Hi everyone! How is everyone? :D
[1:30:48] StromicusRex: when you lose the base race Sadge
[1:30:49] Devcomz: I have noticed Assa Rogues can easily die too
[1:30:50] pisceslonewolf: only if it breaks before 0% hp
[1:31:15] Badasti: xd
[1:31:22] DeityRevert: until you face hpal
[1:31:27] Devcomz: Yeah I actually like going up against Assa its like a glass cannon

[1:38:21] happyheals: ww is pretty good
[1:38:24] stalecheetos: @skooovs prob like B+ maybe A
[1:38:24] Devcomz: Do you see alot of MW in shuffle or 2s or 3s? It seems like their are fewer of them lately or maybe its just part of my queue dice im getting

[1:41:43] Schnellmusic: skwyard ascent is pog
[1:41:55] Espi_27: there's a momentum trick with skyward ascent
[1:42:13] pisceslonewolf: Skyward Ascent trick is the R1 skill
[1:42:16] Espi_27: it's usually better to use it once you learn that trick
[1:42:31] Asharnix: you probably need to ground skim a bit too
[1:42:35] EliteDamit: ascent is faster and I think you’re over capping speed 😝

[1:57:25] realglazed: @venruki are you eastern european?
[1:57:33] MatchlessGlory: 0-6 Ret Lobby?
[1:57:35] Oloraonoa: barracuda diff
[1:57:39] skooovs: Basicly the same
[1:57:44] realglazed: babushka
[1:58:01] Xeliumimar: and thats how Babushka was born
[1:58:01] gentsie: hows the weather out west today? Snowing like a mother out in southern ontario
[1:59:42] rekt1370: 2 melee chasing a mage when they have no purge
[2:00:31] Oreten710: whats happening
[2:00:39] 3KuLTV: how is feral druid in pvp?
[2:00:41] yesterday_potato: Im learning im a better reactive healer than proactive
[2:00:42] premiox: arcane looks sooo fun to play
[2:02:39] JustTaki: wooot wooot!
[2:02:40] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The Fastest One Shots For EVERY SPEC In WoW | Venruki Reacts" view it here: youtu.be/gMhw28UG16k
[2:02:59] Badasti: man i struggle so much to make arcane work
[2:03:10] Zilesky: where in southern ontario i dont see shit yet
[2:03:13] JustTaki: victim class confirmed :p
[2:03:36] Nadasky: Dunno if it's like that for everyone but whenever I tried arcane I found it much harder to just do damage than on any other classes/speccs
[2:03:46] engzyng: Ven.... i hit 2.1 in SS with Hpala and i noticed i get a lot more tilted cuz of my teammates mistakes ( granted i make mistakes too ) . Do you have any advice how to chill out and just play without worry ?
[2:04:11] darkvager: So is frost a dead class now
[2:04:25] W00dyyx: Holy priest!
[2:04:27] Sosatko: doing dmg on arcane def takes some skill
[2:04:36] Sosatko: then dh presses essence break blade dance 😂
[2:04:45] bhphreak: yeah eat boomers and go to the forest for a week
[2:04:51] Snewch: Hahaha R1 tips
[2:04:51] kusoneko: take some deep breaths lol
[2:05:01] Snewch: Ven how do I chill? Just chill bro
[2:05:01] parasKamu: To chill and have fun is very hard in solo arena
[2:05:02] PhDickens: don't obsess over rating obsess over the process
[2:05:08] EliteDamit: focusing on your own plays instead of others (that you can’t control) can help mental :)
[2:05:32] DiscoSlim: dont wait until the last weekday tho it gets harder
[2:05:41] Duellrino: Hey Ven can you google Alex Rins?
[2:05:42] Badasti: @engzyng I recommend watching "You Can Do More Than You Think | The Growth Mindset" by Einzelganger on youtube
[2:05:45] parasKamu: I only feel good and chill when I play bg/rbg.. hitted 2,6k+ in rbg.. but in arena.. its just full stress
[2:05:56] stealthwalker99: The best advice in solo shuffle is it's just statistics given enough games you will go up if you're better. No reason to tilt
[2:05:59] dannydozer: what would you say is the easiest melee class in pvp?
[2:06:02] ferahgok: I want to try and farm Legend but competition is steep around 2400 atm.
[2:06:02] engzyng: @Badasti  will do
[2:06:07] heymomimonttv: @dannydozer dh
[2:06:14] JustTaki: Realizing that everybody makes mistakes and that its really unlikely people are actually inting me vs just making mistakes helps me chill
[2:06:36] nikthevoker: im a 50% er LUL
[2:06:40] heymomimonttv: i'm 103-94 in solos, guess im one of the greats
[2:06:51] bhphreak: u lose 90%
[2:06:54] parasKamu: I have like 40-70% between my main and alts
[2:07:05] stealthwalker99: I don't think so 75%-90% to 2400 for most good players
[2:07:16] martinmcguire6: i started mage this week was 33% winrate and managed to drag myself up to 50% yest XD feels good improving
[2:07:38] parasKamu: I only feel good and chill when I play bg/rbg.. hitted 2,6k+ in rbg.. but in arena.. its just full stress.
[2:07:41] joyrex_j9: my buddy is rank 11 marks with a 49% win
[2:08:02] Ernanz: @parasKamu nobody plays rbgs dawg lol
[2:08:02] stealthwalker99: Yeah 100%
[2:08:11] SlyMooseMan: A lot of one person on the frost leaderboard
[2:08:24] Nadasky: A lotta people seem, to think a good win ratio makes them a good player which is so weird to me since it's so easy to manipulate
[2:08:30] sacothedk: raiku
[2:08:30] parasKamu: @Ernanz yeah they play but not as much anymorwe
[2:08:34] Justinky1: What do you think is the hardest melee besides Rogue?
[2:08:43] heymomimonttv: @Ernanz i play yolo rbg's just to semi gear new characters for arena. rbg's i do not care about whatsoever so dont care if my mmr/rating tanks there
[2:08:47] Ernanz: @parasKamu sadly :/ rbgs should be way more rewarding
[2:08:47] sacothedk: nah hakubak
[2:08:47] parasKamu: @Ernanz solo rbg inc
[2:08:50] nikthevoker: fire seems pretty good for shuffle, so much on demand dmg

[2:19:32] FlyingPuncake: how much worse is fire than arcane? monkaHmm
[2:20:09] crazzbez: and yet people get 2.6k in solo shuffle
[2:20:09] FlyingPuncake: damn :( i like fire more than arcane
[2:20:11] yesterday_potato: your mog screams frost
[2:20:14] FlyingPuncake: but already got arcane to 1800
[2:20:23] jpcbx: hey! currently im only playing PVE content, but really want this new DH PVP outfit, how much time u think i have to spend to get it?
[2:21:53] ripzaddo: on dh youll get it quicklyif you know your m+ rotation Poooound
[2:22:12] ALLtheEXP: @jpcbx I just picked up DH this season and i'm around 2k, so you can get the set really easily. DH is one of the easier classes to do big dam. And the whole point of pvp this season is "Do big Dam and don't die."
[2:22:31] Schnellmusic: Dev pumping :O
[2:22:47] ALLtheEXP: @jpcbx Just check a guide or two and get the damage rotation down (you likely alreayd know it) and make a couple focus cc macros for the healer so you can cc healer while attacking a target and you'll get 1600+ EZ
[2:22:50] Oddyseey: He needs it for this round
[2:22:52] Shezzmou: One button goes hard
[2:23:09] ramenxo: oh how the turntables for dev evoker. once considered the worst spec in the game now they are pressing 1 button terrorizing the sub 1800 ladder. everyone thinks they are busted
[2:23:42] Schnellmusic: @ramenxo best ranged at high rating in EU shuffle
[2:24:01] ramenxo: crazy
[2:24:08] ramenxo: that 1 button rotation slaps
[2:24:27] danger_daft: do you have a macro for that 1 button rotation i can use
[2:24:28] Ernanz: so many clueless folks in chat
[2:24:39] Ernanz: i wonder whats some of you highest rating
[2:24:44] Schnellmusic: @danger_daft right lol
[2:24:56] Schnellmusic: @Ernanz i'm 1100 chill
[2:24:58] danger_daft: I just want spriest to be good again
[2:25:03] Shezzmou: you right he's pressing a million buttons but 70% of his dam is one button
[2:25:07] PastaSeat: imagine defending Dev evoker lmao
[2:25:13] ramenxo: LMAO @Ernanz
[2:25:37] ramenxo: have ven show damage breakdown for that dev evoker after this game

[2:29:14] Valshaw: Hey Venruki, do you suggest sticking to a Glad wep or using the leggo axe in pvp?
[2:29:47] soddi: i remember a time where rogues had exactly 1 vanish

[2:43:34] Sillken: ?
[2:43:37] nikthevoker: LUL the Rsham that didnt use earthern and shitt alked me going 0-5 and leaving 6th round, fun lobby

[2:44:06] evanluan: Kreygasm
[2:44:34] itz_killjoy: im never shocked a healer cant heal, damage is out of control right now
[2:44:55] itz_killjoy: but gotta make damage high for awc viewers LUL
[2:45:12] lordelenath: DPS & HPS are both to high. which is why nothing dies without CC and ppl insta die in CC.
[2:45:28] Xeliumimar: this game is so bad to be a caster LOL
[2:46:00] lordelenath: idk playing warrior into a triple caster lobby feels as bad for me as playing my affl into a triple melee lobby.
[2:46:12] splenaxx: yo:D..play fire mage mastery pvp??
[2:46:21] Xeliumimar: i'm in favor of pre cog lasting 30 seconds

[2:47:37] dakotan517: @itz_killjoy absolutely no
[2:47:54] johnnyquestz: poor disc trying to heal  double dh on  a caster, woof
[2:48:10] Xeliumimar: or like he should get rewarded way more for getting hits dots out, his dots should hit for 100k each LUL
[2:48:31] TimmyShoes: song is appropriate considering anyone dealing with double DH will likely need some brown sugar
[2:48:38] lordelenath: imagine pressuring a rdruid before 50+ damp lmao
[2:48:52] fazedoritoss: this poor poor affy in a triple melee lobby

[2:50:18] lordelenath: j
[2:50:56] lordelenath: there's just more melees around I think. ppl prefer to be the hunter not the prey.
[2:51:04] Badasti: @gelatokush I can take being trained, it's the idiotic comments that usually come with joining a lobby where you get hard countered
[2:51:08] chrihorp: poor lock
[2:51:15] dakotan517: @Badasti this
[2:51:18] lordelenath: good talk!

[2:56:15] Nadasky: why is that belt wiggling so much LUL
[2:58:40] OMGWhatsHisFace: there is nothing worse in wow than 16-1800 shuffles. change my mind. it's a cess pit. if you're playing a hero class (dh/dk/rogue/etc.) idk how you climb out without luck or being r1
[3:00:46] Clonepeanut: @OMGWhatsHisFace I have never been 2400, and I've gotten 1800 in SS on 8 classes
[3:00:53] Clonepeanut: this season
[3:01:07] dakotan517: we've all been the hardest countered person
[3:01:10] dakotan517: issa no fun
[3:01:17] crazzbez: he's playing warlock, forget it
[3:01:18] nameyourform: i feel like in 80% of my shuff pops im the only range
[3:01:22] nameyourform: and it makes me want to leave
[3:01:28] OMGWhatsHisFace: @Clonepeanut i've gone way beyond 1.8 on many classes too. but aff lock has been miserable.
[3:01:37] fazedoritoss: i dont tell my viewers to play my spec

[3:09:10] hackit_: dh so skilled

[3:14:28] ZealotryTV: i get wrecked by MS/sharpen or are you saying better talent options in general into hpal?
[3:14:32] yesterday_potato: due to dmg reduction i guess
[3:15:07] Varaben: @ramenxo @Zenlyn and the boys in awc?
[3:15:24] ramenxo: they usually play thug
[3:15:25] Satedtv: never dark
[3:15:44] ramenxo: with the only rogue in the game that plays with a rage bar instead of energy
[3:15:47] Varaben: Devilchester is always in the light, he wouldnt dark
[3:16:27] Varaben: i might try dev evoker, they seem pretty dece plus i can farm conquest on pres
[3:17:12] ramenxo: devoker fun asf unless u get bored of pressing 1 button
[3:17:18] ramenxo: it gets old really quick
[3:18:14] Varaben: @ramenxo im all for a simple rotation
[3:18:25] ramenxo: youll love dev evoker then lol
[3:18:41] ramenxo: its as close to a 1 button rotation as you can come in wow
[3:19:38] Varaben: @Zenlyn good luck, always enjoy seeing you guys compete!
[3:21:04] drewlivelyy: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove

[3:21:45] ramenxo: say it or im not resubbing i didnt give you 5$ to be teased with toxicity
[3:21:54] ramenxo: chat thrives on toxicity
[3:22:01] ramenxo: we feed on it
[3:22:02] Zenlyn: its a clip!
[3:22:40] zachgamegodx: mouse over timestop FTW
[3:22:48] ramenxo: I had to make a macro "TIME STOP DO NOT TRINKET" on my evoker
[3:22:53] ferahgok: can you make a macro to just time stop  yourself? how are you hitting a PET of all things?
[3:22:56] ramenxo: bc even in like 2100+ lobbies ppl will send the trinket into it
[3:23:01] wackpoetic: Only timestop when you're in Smoke Bomb, or healer is in CC with no trinket
[3:23:07] wackpoetic: otherwise it's 100% troll
[3:23:10] heymomimonttv: this song is so sick, love pink floyd
[3:23:10] Zenlyn: HAHAHAHAH NOT WRONG
[3:23:32] dakotan517: KEK
[3:23:33] halcyonwow: just remove cheat death
[3:23:48] Ernanz: remove rogues out the game make Azeroth great again
[3:23:53] Tyferious: Can you explain that as. Layman
[3:24:07] Xeliumimar: david gilmours pompeii versions are all the best imo
[3:24:48] Zenlyn: u mean rmp?
[3:24:49] crazzbez: rogues are not bad stop it
[3:25:09] Zenlyn: ohh ye, they just get omega outshined
[3:25:19] Xeliumimar: frost isnt toxic you think frost is bad lol
[3:25:25] dakotan517: frost is monka
[3:26:01] yowler_: hasn’t frost always kind of been like that lol
[3:26:11] Xeliumimar: bring back cata frost plssss
[3:26:19] ramenxo: if the community voted right now to ban 1 spec from rated pvp for the rest of the seaso nwhat spec do you think would win
[3:26:29] nuggetzwarr123: dh or dev or rogue
[3:26:33] gavinbeast15: Sick mog
[3:26:34] McLaughlin11: rdruid!
[3:26:34] agren13: Frost is very toxic with the omega roots and slows, also really not a fan of frost bomb either being an auto dispell or 300k+ wombocombo
[3:26:39] mat4th: I think frost's dmg combined with the slow/utlity is what makes them so annoying
[3:26:41] ramenxo: it would almost certainly be sub rogue
[3:26:43] dakotan517: rogue rdru or dh
[3:26:48] yowler_: as far back as the days of melee not being able to touch them
[3:26:50] joyrex_j9: watch me get butt blasted by gorecki
[3:26:54] vanncleff: What does Garbanzo mean?
[3:27:02] Zenlyn: time to die instantly into phs Sadge
[3:27:04] Schnellmusic: Wasn't Gorecki a healer for years and randomly was killing it on a rogue last ssn?
[3:27:04] sind233: remove disc from shuffle por favor
[3:27:07] jukeandnuke: isn't knowing how much it aggravates other players what makes it fun though?
[3:27:25] BCboy_: Gore was rank 1 disc couple days ago prob trying to get it back rn
[3:27:26] ryanblue98: or could mean garbo at game
[3:27:53] jukeandnuke: i think he muted himself :(
[3:28:24] jukeandnuke: crap i muted myself
[3:28:38] jukeandnuke: my speakers aren't working now
[3:29:05] vanncleff: Three gnomes?
[3:29:12] Zenlyn: what do you meaaaaaaan 62k pyroblast during combust

[3:29:50] crazzbez: die ret paladin
[3:30:08] Zenlyn: Of dps *
[3:30:17] Shinizter: I dont think ive ever tuned into Vens stream and been disappointed in the music. So good

[3:34:29] dakotan517: super fun to watch
[3:34:36] nameyourform: hes an og
[3:35:42] crazzbez: good disc priests are disgusting to deal with in solo shuffle
[3:36:08] crazzbez: felt so good denying one his 6th win on the last round earlier by killing him
[3:36:09] rekt1370: yea fade on a 20 second cd is crazy
[3:36:18] sourbutts: @crazzbez as what spec
[3:37:15] sourbutts: ice wall is really good into priest as it stops penitence also
[3:37:20] thecandyshopowner: block play
[3:37:20] reczy__: That md tho
[3:37:21] derangedhippo: 6-0 inc
[3:37:36] IGna7iusIV: 6 0 for Goreckiq
[3:37:50] crazzbez: @sourbutts I was frost mage
[3:38:27] sourbutts: @crazzbez after death and fade he has nothing to stop getting cc'd other than los though, druid is way more annoying imo
[3:39:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: "With next week’s reset, the Conquest cap will be removed. In addition, Spoils of War will become active, providing increases to Conquest and Honor earned."
[3:40:06] dakotan517: youre so good at mage
[3:40:08] vibesham: No idea how you're running away with this lobby
[3:40:17] twinbladeuk: Ret players are chads EZ
[3:40:19] Texdizzle: need the seis
[3:40:20] kashmoney31: garbanzo beans are my fav
[3:40:21] heymomimonttv: @wEiRdO_dUdE huh, did patch notes come out?
[3:40:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Not from patch notes, that was from a Blues News thing
[3:40:55] heymomimonttv: gotcha, still cool
[3:41:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: It'll be easier for Venruki to gear up the sub rogue next week! LUL
[3:42:36] DoYouWannaHug: Mages and Rsham going together so well LUL
[3:42:50] Holtan3111: Does Nether tempes break Sheeps ?
[3:42:54] ezmoney3434: this song is awful lol
[3:43:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: The follower dungeon exp increase is interesting to me, I wouldn't have thought they'd incentivize it much
[3:43:23] rekt1370: follower dungs take forever those ai bots doing no damage
[3:44:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I did some follower dungeons last night to clear the quest log, they seemed alright, but I think running with real players should be worth more exp
[3:44:07] dakotan517: beast cleave maybe?
[3:44:25] dooshken: I ran a follower dungeon too, it was so weird
[3:44:55] dooshken: All these years I feel like I've been doing dungeons with AI, now they're actual AI
[3:45:20] dakotan517: @dooshken LOL
[3:45:26] rekt1370: tru LUL
[3:45:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think I managed to get a follower killed like 3 times LUL
[3:45:33] crazzbez: @dooshken now you don't have to doubt anything!
[3:45:44] ryanblue98: @dooshken i wonder if they will include back talking tanks who leave the dungeon or pull way too much mobs
[3:45:45] ALLtheEXP: @venruki Can you tell me how you came up with Venruki as a name? I assume it has partly to do with your real name.
[3:46:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: 4 wins is good stuff
[3:46:12] Holtan3111: What warlock spec do you think is easiest to get 1800 in solo shuffle ?
[3:46:18] dakotan517: thats sick
[3:46:29] ALLtheEXP: omg the old Counter Strike days rukiLove
[3:46:34] ramenxo: my name comes from my favorite food when i lived in japan
[3:46:38] OMGWhatsHisFace: what origin is venczel?
[3:46:52] ALLtheEXP: Venczel is a dope name
[3:46:53] Zenlyn: @ramenxo was ur favorite food rice
[3:46:53] papagoog: venpookibear waiting party
[3:46:57] papagoog: when will the dru happen
[3:46:57] ramenxo: yes
[3:47:00] gelatokush: theres a new Kabuki ramata skin in OW pretty sure with the chineses mask
[3:47:10] ramenxo: actually my favorite food was a chinese dish called xo
[3:47:23] ALLtheEXP: My name comes from that time about 10 years ago I tried to start a youtube channel
[3:47:26] THEURBANSPECTACLE: HI VEN ^_______________^
[3:47:35] dooshken: @dooshken They actually do have them make comments
[3:47:52] Zenlyn: when i play other stuff i just get mad that im not good at it then i just log back on priest
[3:47:53] Badasti: that's how I've played since classic
[3:47:54] Keveldinho: I just started playing arms war recently after playing ele sham for all 3 seasons
[3:47:55] papagoog: i feel like me alting so much has made me better and worse at the same time
[3:48:05] ALLtheEXP: @papagoog 2 real 4 me
[3:48:10] thisisthotcaller: yep i defs feel that
[3:48:11] wackpoetic: takes a certain kind of masochism to only play holy priest though
[3:48:13] Wogrim: if you chase fun instead of gear, alt is the meta
[3:48:19] Badasti: took me like 17 years of wow to figure out I was a mage main LUL
[3:48:27] DoYouWannaHug: Ya same
[3:48:29] dooshken: I feel like you lose out on a lot of fun when you just play 1 spec
[3:48:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Don't fear the man who has practiced 1,000 different kicks, fear the one who has practiced one kick 1,000 times."
[3:48:44] thedonmac: qnd that will be?
[3:48:58] jukeandnuke: bruce lee quote
[3:49:03] papagoog: like when i play my rogue b4 i was pretty quickly gettting close to r1 range on outlaw, since alting i just suck
[3:49:10] thisisthotcaller: but people keep juking me :( i cant kick for shit
[3:49:10] DoYouWannaHug: But practicing different kicks in this situation is learning how others are kicking to counter their kicks
[3:49:14] Badasti: @wEiRdO_dUdE unless a bro hovers off the ground, then what are the kicks gonna do to bro
[3:49:26] ALLtheEXP: I'm hating how much I enjoy DH playstyle (all the flipping around and movement) because I don't see myself as a DH main and I don't want to be but i'm just having too much fun
[3:49:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is something to be said for repetition, I think
[3:49:28] jukeandnuke: in martial arts it does to a degree
[3:49:36] wackpoetic: "Don't fear the man who has practiced 1000 different kicks, fear the man who can kick, Shadowy Duel, Vanish, Cloak immune, etc..."
[3:49:38] kesharq: If you only know one kick then it would be so easy to dodge:P
[3:49:38] ALLtheEXP: Well @venruki Bruce Lee is dead, so, he doesn't believe anything atm
[3:49:41] ferahgok: but what about the guy that practices multiple kicks 1,000 times?
[3:49:41] bollskis: i mean u practice one kick a thousands times ur gonna be legend at it, u practice a thousands kicks once u suck at them all
[3:50:07] jukeandnuke: technique matters - the more you strive to perfect one technique the more effective it can be
[3:50:20] ALLtheEXP: @venruki  just grab the arena rating QA so everyone knows where you're at on each class lol
[3:50:26] Badasti: all the bruce lee's in chat sharing their wisdom now
[3:50:29] jukeandnuke: but definitely learn more than one :)
[3:50:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are pros and cons to multiclassing, for sure
[3:50:43] Satedtv: "if you know the way broadly you will see it in all things"
[3:50:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: You learn more about the others

[3:50:58] Zenlyn: Personally if i stop playing priest for more than 1 day i suck at it
[3:51:13] ALLtheEXP: @Zenlyn that sounds horrible
[3:51:22] ramenxo: its like riding a bike
[3:51:22] papagoog: i mean there is somthign special about being a 1 trick pony
[3:51:24] Badasti: @Zenlyn man im the total opposite, i find taking a week or 2 clears my head and i play better
[3:51:28] dooshken: I'm doing a random dragon race in the Azure Span and I swear I just saw 8 bots in a line all flying on the same inputs lol
[3:51:29] ShawniXD: i used to never make alts but ever since DF droped ive been multi classing a ton
[3:51:36] prtwentyfour: anytime buddy
[3:51:37] wackpoetic: Multi-classing helps you perceive the all around game state, single-classing helps you understand how to take advantage of the game state 5Head
[3:52:09] nicoros61: Its gonna be -2 F in tennessee tomorrow night
[3:52:21] kaoreal: And last week we were -40...

[3:53:01] pure__goat: there tuning coming out today??
[3:53:01] dooshken: 50 degrees is what it's at right now where I am and it's cold lol
[3:53:08] Badasti: man i dont mind what temp it is i just want to see the sun. This darkness isn't doing my moods any good
[3:53:45] pure__goat: ohh
[3:53:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's always a good day for tuning
[3:53:48] dooshken: 50 degrees is jacket weather Louisiana
[3:53:54] pure__goat: i was reading your title
[3:54:04] pure__goat: hopefully sub getsd gutted
[3:54:25] Cdenzy: sub getting buffed
[3:54:26] ramenxo: sub rogue will see a 5% shadowstrike nerf and shadowy blades will have CD reduced to 1 minute to compensate
[3:54:31] Zenlyn: tree's shouldnt be usable in pvp i think
[3:54:32] xantoor: love this song
[3:54:42] ramenxo: dev evoker will get another disint nerf or a bug causing it to not proc eternity surge as often fixed
[3:54:43] dooshken: the dev team is a bunch of sub rogues. That spec never gets nerfed
[3:54:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: The data says unholy DK might get whacked with a nerf bat
[3:54:54] pure__goat: watch they remove cdr from sub
[3:54:56] ramenxo: treants will have 5 charges now but another 5% mastery nerf
[3:54:56] pure__goat: its coming
[3:55:01] Yaycarrots: 🥦
[3:55:04] fazedoritoss: think its crazy how they can proc like 10 trees
[3:55:09] UziiB: rukiLove
[3:55:12] pure__goat: problem fixed
[3:55:12] fazedoritoss: its almost like they are playing starcraft or something
[3:55:20] Yaycarrots: oh man.. now I want a chicken stirfry with tons of broccoli
[3:55:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH could definitely be tuned down
[3:55:41] suhnu: as rdruid gamer, could they just remove the treants from game. literally bm hunter of healers
[3:55:58] Smexxin: BLOOD DRINKER
[3:56:12] Zenlyn: i heard on the grapevine that fire mage + sp are being buffed and rdruid is bein nerfed
[3:56:28] fazedoritoss: @Smexxin is there any hope for afflock in the future
[3:56:29] Lleo00: BASED
[3:56:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Nerfing resto druid sounds fine
[3:56:39] Badasti: mage buffs? cant be true
[3:56:45] Smexxin: god i hope so, they need it @fazedoritoss
[3:56:48] heymomimonttv: the grape vine? ooo i memba
[3:56:48] ramenxo: give pres evoker a new ability called Emerald Whelplings. Summon an emerald whelpling that does a big dream breath and then spams living flame. 3 charges off GCD
[3:56:51] suhnu: just remove the damn trants and all g
[3:56:51] ramenxo: thatll show em
[3:56:53] crazzbez: fire 1000% could use buffs
[3:56:54] Lleo00: fire needs some milk
[3:56:54] dooshken: AWC gonna be so much more interesting if every healer isn't rdruid
[3:57:16] Lleo00: feel like i just die if im trained in low cr lobbies
[3:57:21] Badasti: @dooshken and 1 of every teams dps isnt a rogue
[3:57:26] vibesham: Can I get 3 healing stream totems then and make them unkillable
[3:57:48] Smexxin: its a rough life
[3:57:53] Badasti: tho tbh i think pallys might still be played in awc, stronk cd's
[3:58:08] wackpoetic: now imagine being a single-minded fury war, spending 2 extra talent points to do even less damage
[3:58:18] vibesham: Sounds good, I like that
[3:58:22] gracioussatan: I like this idea
[3:58:24] Locturnal_TV: with a chance to proc healing streams
[3:58:27] Lleo00: resto spawns like a thousand water eles that heal
[3:58:29] Secretwombatbro: they should jsut upgrade totems to be lil elementals
[3:58:30] fazedoritoss: tis the season for helaers to summon npcs
[3:58:34] ramenxo: just give every healer a treant equivalent at this point fuck it.
[3:58:35] Secretwombatbro: so they can cast and move around
[3:58:37] gracioussatan: put them on par with rdruid stupidness
[3:58:47] Polyrhythmz: surely they would never put something so treantlike in the game
[3:58:51] Smexxin: i wanna spawn mini earth elementals that run around with your totems and run away from your enemies
[3:58:53] Ashrow: Or a talent that proc a naaru on hpriest, that do damage and heal. Wait
[3:58:55] Badasti: treants are just upgraded mobile totems
[3:58:57] Secretwombatbro: make earthen trap your teamates inside it
[3:59:03] gracioussatan: need those NPCs for those infinite CC chains
[3:59:04] Secretwombatbro: like static totem
[3:59:12] wackpoetic: Bring back Monk Fallen Order homies
[3:59:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fun incoming!
[3:59:24] OMGWhatsHisFace: better hair wins
[3:59:32] fazedoritoss: i heard the 1v1 with war comes down with luck with procs

[3:59:43] gothiquecat: sit on him
[3:59:45] ECH0F0XTR0T: I'm all for buffing up the other healers, need to keep bringing in more healers to speed up queues
[3:59:46] Secretwombatbro: disarm or safeguard
[3:59:47] Lleo00: sharpen prob
[3:59:48] Copiumgold: mess him up then spit on him
[3:59:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disarming sounds fun to me
[4:00:03] Magottx: I had the most rare lobby last night, 2 Afflic lovks. I 5-1 him tho CoolCat

[4:00:45] Polyrhythmz: dragonrage scary
[4:00:51] Badasti: that didn't look dominant
[4:00:53] Badasti: but thats ok
[4:00:54] dailyshuffle: now unleash the joe in you ven
[4:00:57] Badasti: we can bring this back
[4:01:22] Magottx: I really hate fighting dragons tbh.

[4:02:27] Moobot: @ezyoulee Details, SArena, Omnibar, OmniCD, Big Debuffs, Weak Auras, RaiderIO addon
[4:02:31] ramenxo: Treants, Emerald Whelplings (evoker), Silver Hand Recruit (pally), Lightspawn (priest), Jade Construct (monk), Earthen Ally (shaman) ez. now every healer can summon a a creature to pilot them to ratings they dont deserve
[4:02:59] Badasti: i wish there would be a unique sound effect when two warriors  are blending into eachother at the same time
[4:03:15] fireruler96: @venruki , when do you think is the best time to que solos???

[4:36:51] stepdaddayy: should make them all available, and purchase what you want. ez
[4:36:53] Borngood: KEKW
[4:36:56] yesterday_potato: pvp exclusive sets bonus back

[4:37:16] dooshken: players don't know what they want on the whole
[4:37:24] IronlakPat: bro even the mog designs are embarrasing imo
[4:37:26] BLOOKTROOP: its not negative, its okay to have an opinion for or against something
[4:37:38] nightmxz: Surely sub rogues won't just have an insane tier and 1-shot us all right?
[4:37:38] DigitalBodyBuilder: Blizz should just let every1 select whichever bonus they want.
[4:37:40] OhZ0ne: They should have voted for a pve teir set and pvp teir.
[4:37:41] wackpoetic: would have been so nice if they gave us all so we could try 2/2 mixes
[4:37:45] Borngood: at least it's a short season
[4:37:48] ferahgok: just allow all of them and let player decide when they're converting at the catalyst. ez
[4:37:50] crymorre: What's funny is the # of votes too, didn't realize the engagement would be so pitiable
[4:37:51] Borngood: just gotta go next

[4:37:57] jayyArrington: enhance got s3 tier set
[4:37:57] Badasti: why didnt they just let us select teh set bonus in game, so each player can get what they want rather than some stupid arbitrary vote
[4:38:01] theodeth: insta cast living flame
[4:38:03] nightmxz: Pretty sure sub rogue legit couldn't lose, all the tiers were gross
[4:38:12] macdeezyx: so did Dh....

[4:38:25] didgeridoo1001: The lock winners blow my mind a little

[5:31:38] Ultramagnus85: is pres your favorite healer?
[5:31:46] aarongarey1993: I think healer evoker needs more healing buffs but I am probably wrong
[5:32:01] NeoxitBG: @venruki  can i send the video in the chat?
[5:32:03] Ultramagnus85: healer evoker is awful imo
[5:32:24] serratedlove: any healer is awful if their dps dont press cds
[5:32:32] pattarx: prevoker is really good with people that use their damage and setups
[5:32:41] asdfhoonz: i think prese is better than public perception of it
[5:34:01] chubmax: the hunter forgot his roar button
[5:34:26] bump1: why turtle when you can kill command?
[5:34:28] bump1: HMMMMMMMMMMM?
[5:34:32] Libolik: DPS players and not using personals while healer is in CC name a more iconic combo
[5:34:53] bump1: healer cc'd weak aura should be apart of the standard blizz interface
[5:34:59] Shezzmou: everyone just accusing everyone of botting at this point
[5:35:02] serratedlove: @Libolik dps players trinketing the first cc that hits them while at 100% hp

[5:39:31] Ovawith: cdew doesnt seem to have fun healing as this class either in shuffle
[5:39:53] Itankarenas: I think the short range makes it hard in shuffle cuz u have no coordination
[5:40:02] Ultramagnus85: honestly hitting 2100 on pres is amazing
[5:41:06] e10100111001: lizard range either gets you cc'd or swapped to. tough
[5:41:12] numero5218: is the legendary scary to fight against ?
[5:41:32] Wingclipt: it's severely nerfed.
[5:41:49] Itankarenas: is pres mastery % based or flat?
[5:41:58] Ashrow: @numero5218 the on use effect is a 140k damage 3 second channel that root you
[5:42:20] numero5218: sounds wack

[5:44:06] DoYouWannaHug: I want to make food but I know this 40 minute queue will pop any second.

[7:11:32] morbidly_obese_panda: does fireblasting on warr reflect before glacialspike hits work?
[7:12:02] GenericPierate: i think only fire can blast mid cast
[7:12:13] dakotan517: devoker?
[7:12:41] morbidly_obese_panda: yea i used to fireblast at end of gpie cast but im wondering after u finish casting glacial and fireblast insta
[7:12:41] trashukkonen: ven are we down to get some prevoker gameplay?
[7:12:45] nikthevoker: holy fuck, elo hell is torture
[7:12:57] astrry: @morbidly_obese_panda I'd assume yes, you can counterspell the reflect down before glacial hits and get precog as a bonus
[7:13:13] morbidly_obese_panda: nice ty
[7:13:18] astrry: so I think fireblash should work the same here
[7:13:24] astrry: fireblast*
[7:13:37] nikthevoker: i found the bot healers
[7:13:38] GenericPierate: ohh in that case whatever hits first
[7:13:52] danieltsmoke: sometimes I feel like blizzard and ring of fire are wasted cds when the enemy chases you away from it.
[7:14:20] Gradyolson1: i thought garbanzo was fire only?
[7:14:21] astrry: yeah reflect is calculated on hit + it has some grace period where it will reflect multiple things like fireball + pyro queued together will both be reflected
[7:14:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
[7:14:35] kyaii: I wonder if we'll get a balance patch before AWC and if so what the balance patch will look like

[7:44:57] Axtin: its a nerf to sub rogue so ill take it

[7:45:00] nikthevoker: adding stam is a cop out
[7:45:01] joyrex_j9: why did rsham catch a random armor nerf tho

[7:46:20] brewtank: the root change and fear change are nice
[7:46:21] Roxxybolts: was a pointless spell w/o that change
[7:46:23] sourbutts: lock is about to go crazt
[7:46:24] sTyless310: the changes at the top do they apply to pvp if it doesnt say specifically it doesnt
[7:46:25] wicked_wizurd: i could see BM/MM hunters being stronger now to
[7:46:30] CHMage: where are polymorph buffs? Heal the enemy and cant take damage? @venruki
[7:46:34] sourbutts: destro gonna bolt you twice in fear without it breaking
[7:46:35] dakotan517: yeah with plate nerf
[7:46:36] trashukkonen: trashukkonen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 🤷🏼‍♂️

[7:46:53] Demonicchaos554: ty ty
[7:46:55] Pherix1: as if that did anything KEKW
[7:46:56] wackpoetic: How much more armor does leather have than cloth currently? Is it more than 35%? Does plate have more than 30% armor than mail? this is so confusing
[7:46:57] layzdude85: one of the devs in charge of stamina/health pools seen palumors one shot video lol
[7:47:03] garythos: ret will be S tier again ? :D
[7:47:04] Locturnal_TV: i like how the only way they know to balance sub is "evis nerf by x%"
[7:47:06] sTyless310: do all those paladin buffs apply to pvp??
[7:47:07] Frequently1: Warlock Fear Break thing got offset in the warlock pvp note section

[7:47:16] strafekey: yes they do
[7:47:16] mac_zo: no frost dk buffs?
[7:47:17] Axtin: the weird thing about the armor change is it makes certain matchups like warrior vs mage even worse for the warrior
[7:47:18] eainzsp: I wonder if we can play stormbreaker again
[7:47:18] AndroniusMaximus: Holy priest might be nuts

[7:47:37] brewtank: all armor types are the same now!!! Pog !!!
[7:47:37] garythos: no DH nerfs, thats weird
[7:47:38] Frequently1: And the stam buffs, because they get all that extra hp
[7:47:44] figurines: are they balancing around mid tier shuffle? swear thats the only way these changes make sense
[7:47:45] Gotheels: mage/lock is back

[7:48:40] boundric: SV hunter buff. YEAR OF THE SPEAR!
[7:48:43] Frequently1: Wizard meta more? Cloth up, plate down
[7:48:44] Cdenzy: RLD meta
[7:48:45] ramenxo: @venruki im curious now if they just completely didnt look at numbers and as a priest you can no longer death fear/root beam with this change
[7:48:47] walokki: i fucking hate how LAZY blizz is ..cant even make new SEASON 4 tiers hahhahahahaha

[7:49:21] absterge: stam buff + rogue nerf, those comps are suddenly less scary because u don't just die in the go. druid nerf + SP/RET getting huge damage increases. armor buff is going to be disgusting for warlocks I think too
[7:49:21] ItsYaBoyOOH: RIP DK

[7:49:31] dairox_tv: rogues has become nerf

[7:50:13] chaosemperor77: shadow demo sounds disgusting
[7:50:16] itz_killjoy: 35% more armor is like 2% dmg reduction LUL
[7:50:17] atoker: caster comp will win the first cup

[7:55:28] Hamrock77: Want to fix rogues? Reduce Cheap shot from 4 seconds to 2.5 boom, hire me blizzard
[7:55:31] Ambersulfr: that’s basically what they did by nerfing our armor
[7:55:35] Falcanus: @rekt1370 everyone has more health now, harder to 1 shot
[7:55:37] remofreecss: I wasnt expecting changes só close of the awc
[7:55:37] rekt1370: ret got their armor reduced and they already die super easy
[7:55:39] 인터넷포트: 20% more dmg on wings and wings already good u best be scared of the retribution paladin wings
[7:55:48] Mechgyrasaur: the only caster that I think should've been buffed was shadow priest feel like mage and lock were all ready decent, no?
[7:55:52] brewtank: I feel like MM single handedly caused the armor changes KEKW
[7:55:55] remofreecss: @absterge this Nerfs of rdruid are significante?

[7:57:03] ViDDVuun: Not ness at all
[7:57:04] rekt1370: think it was everyone dies so fast damage is giga high
[7:57:05] Frequently1: Prob just a way to recruit helaers
[7:57:05] maxdoesmath: stam and armor change to much in one pass without seeing impact imo
[7:57:07] shredder1111: from healer pov it was needed
[7:57:07] blackvpnv: they did ret dirty
[7:57:10] Cvarks: ring of fire buffs
[7:57:13] Cvarks: every patch
[7:57:13] tikdoks: I think it’s needed for SS
[7:57:13] Cvarks: gg
[7:57:18] sharpdressedman15: remember when they nerfed crit by 50% to prevent spiky damage... yeah...
[7:57:18] Primetimexxxx: I believe it was needed
[7:57:20] crymorre: they changed way too many variables at the same time on top of tuning
[7:57:20] tikdoks: not sure anywhere else
[7:57:20] llllliiilllii: @venruki did you end up looking at my IG you owe me an appology for calling me a liar ;)
[7:57:21] Smexxin: think dealing with the sub 1 sec 50% hp bursts as a healer or varioius dps
[7:57:23] Smexxin: is rough
[7:57:23] blacksheytanz: was thinking that you are waiting for a game on your mage in the same time
[7:57:23] rekt1370: you ever try and heal dh dk rn LUL
[7:57:24] alan6778: @venruki u liken hpal

[7:57:28] ImJordanHi: Do you think you'll be playing ret/Demo with Vanguards this season?
[7:57:28] Asharnix: The stam buff is going make the bear tank trolling in battlegrounds even worse
[7:57:28] Cvarks: 80k rof ticks
[7:57:29] figurines: At lower rating the stamina buffs are needed. I feel like these changes aren't necessarily based on the top end of the ladder @venruki
[7:57:32] maxdoesmath: this meta >>>>>>>> damp
[7:57:32] Mesmerized9879: maybe it's also to help Lock in SS
[7:57:35] llllliiilllii: anthony.fll
[7:57:46] anmusallam: will dk become super squish now @venruki
[7:57:52] gracioussatan: bro this dude is still going on and on about his weight lifting?
[7:57:56] LubD5: Venruki help me pick between Mage and Destro Lock. I havent played any of those. I main healer atm.
[7:57:56] betasoldier: Just got a 496k glacial spike in SS!
[7:57:56] gracioussatan: give it a rest bro that was hours ago
[7:58:06] garythos: armor change means plate get +5% more dmg from physical, thats not that mutch
[7:58:09] sourbutts: priest teams about to have 1.5m   health
[7:58:10] tikdoks: fire mage might be playable now
[7:58:10] sharpdressedman15: @lubd5 lock
[7:58:16] ItsBees: LUL
[7:58:19] blackvpnv: ret probably got the biggest buff
[7:58:35] Falcanus: surprised no dev evoker nerfs, that spec is bonkers when played really well
[7:58:52] Mechgyrasaur: shadow priest ret new meta comp Kappa
[7:58:54] jayyArrington: blizz hate enhance QQ
[7:58:57] kreyzy8: shadowplay might just damp everything
[7:59:00] LubD5: @lubd5 Ty guys ! May I know why would you pick that? Does mage have higher skill cap?
[7:59:02] garythos: it is about 5% armor change ingame right ?
[7:59:03] ItsBees: they still didn't get rid of eclipse for boomy Sadge
[7:59:32] OMGWhatsHisFace: does sac still work if paladin is cloned?
[7:59:33] buffevoker: Resto druids didnt get enough nerfs need more
[7:59:41] nikthevoker: LUL lobby DH didnt use any CDs, what a suprise
[7:59:43] trashukkonen: what do you think am i gonna see some success with hpriest finally
[7:59:43] Falcanus: @jayyArrington enh is stronger next patch, more stam = slower game, less one shots and more chance to use ur offheals. also armor buffs dont affect you
[7:59:44] OMGWhatsHisFace: @faffafuufaa nerf their range by 10 yards :)
[8:00:15] Cvarks: i think warlocks are the bread winners here
[8:00:18] gracioussatan: you're in arena with Bob. you can't be making those types of mistakes
[8:00:19] OMGWhatsHisFace: i dont understand why ww got nerfed though
[8:00:24] dairox_tv: focus now or bob kick u
[8:00:24] Cvarks: that class is gonna need jesus to take down
[8:00:45] Vaale17: demo lock werent tanky enough ofc blizz buff their armor :D
[8:00:47] Ambersulfr: I like the warlock tank return but it’s going to be rough while they get them adjusted around it
[8:00:48] dairox_tv: BUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
[8:01:01] dairox_tv: T3 and 0 changes vs BOB
[8:01:12] buffevoker: Lol that people said that blizz wouldnt change stuff cause awc is coming, they dont fucking care
[8:01:14] ImJordanHi: Dude Elliott is kind of a freak on Hpal wtf

[8:01:21] Nachofez: can anyone link the patch notes please?
[8:01:23] Nachofez: i missed it
[8:01:24] Demonicchaos554: You think we are going to feel that WW nerf?
[8:01:25] Cvarks: how big is 35 percent armor buff
[8:01:28] Nachofez: i was in a shuff
[8:01:29] Frequently1: I wonder how bad the plate armor nerf hurts holy paladins? Seems like they get trained a lot already
[8:01:35] ImJordanHi: @Cvarks 35%
[8:01:41] dubbledayy: u pumped for the nice weather next week my guy
[8:01:43] ViDDVuun: Ret Paladin should be able to eat Warlocks since our damage isnt Physical
[8:01:47] Cvarks: @ImJordanHi ty
[8:01:50] Cvarks: LOL
[8:01:52] shredder1111: letting the meta go stale to appease awc competitors would be a terrible business decision
[8:01:52] blackvpnv: 35% on warlock i odnt like
[8:01:56] ImJordanHi: @Cvarks ;)
[8:01:59] dubbledayy: noice
[8:02:16] dipicat: @havenblood classic nahj take
[8:02:19] blackvpnv: warlock is already relly tanki
[8:02:21] Ambersulfr: they’ll probably end up going back and adjusting the warlocks buffs
[8:02:25] raizee1: locks with 10% more stamina bonus from trinket set and 35% more armor feelsbadman
[8:02:25] Ambersulfr: eventually
[8:02:29] MoneyShotSix: is wow down right now for anyone else?
[8:02:30] IamWalnuts: nahj also said rogue was dead when blind got nerfed
[8:02:32] OMGWhatsHisFace: and why did resto sham get their armor nerfed??
[8:02:37] joyrex_j9: armors been need normalization for awhile
[8:02:45] joyrex_j9: needing*
[8:02:47] blackvpnv: its warlock gonna be unkillable
[8:02:51] sourbutts: assass still will be squishy
[8:03:03] What_ln_Tarnation: you see the new tuning?
[8:03:12] valdexxl: ret will be good
[8:03:17] Axtin: i think the plate nerfs are bigger than the cloth buffs
[8:03:23] raizee1: Bob needs to go mage!
[8:03:33] buffnac: all hail the mail wearing overlords
[8:03:34] Cvarks: wait wtf is that fear change
[8:03:34] 2morebeers: i see the class changes first place i come is here. what we thinkin?!
[8:03:35] Cvarks: LMFAO
[8:03:42] Ambersulfr: roots too
[8:03:42] Frequently1: Evoker armor goated now lol
[8:03:58] ImJordanHi: @Cvarks They're just trying to turn fear into a running stun that you can attack through and it doesnt break Kappa
[8:04:00] SpeedyMcD: why do some kicks last way longer than others?
[8:04:20] Ambersulfr: because blizzard hates shamans
[8:04:21] sixthycent: bro chan about to have a field day next week
[8:04:23] sourbutts: @SpeedyMcD based on their cooldown
[8:04:36] ViDDVuun: Druid and Locks are goign to be everywhere, Lock fears and druid spam roots, they wont break for atleast 2 Chaos Bolts worth of damage.
[8:04:37] sixthycent: untouchable and nonstop dmg without fear breaking
[8:04:52] Frequently1: People realize the nightmare nerf in warlock section offsets fear damage buff
[8:04:55] Frequently1: I hope
[8:05:11] Squantanimo: anyone have a link for these notes? can’t find
[8:05:16] Ambersulfr: https://www.wowhead.com/blue-tracker/topic/us/class-tuning-incoming-january-23-1770076
[8:05:23] Squantanimo: TY!
[8:05:34] sourbutts: @Frequently1 not for shadow priest though, about to eat fear and then a full void torrent without it breaking
[8:05:46] amgine04: the root break will help shams a bit with earthgrab
[8:05:56] ViDDVuun: Shockadin gonna be crazy with teh SotR buff, Denounce going to hit like a truck with talent
[8:06:03] gracioussatan: 50% damp lay on hands
[8:06:04] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The REALISTIC Best Specs To Climb Rating With In Dragonflight PvP | Venruki Reacts" view it here: youtu.be/Qhuz8vVOX8I
[8:06:05] zurdo1988: yeh i never use lay on hands
[8:06:09] Stoichulk: Letting down Bob...
[8:06:09] ItsBees: Bob Sadge
[8:06:10] buffevoker: We need more r druid nerfs
[8:06:11] Frequently1: Yeah agree @sourbutts spriest always annoying to play into
[8:06:11] syniron: lol "dang i died"
[8:06:16] Relyst: garbanzo gaming
[8:06:17] gracioussatan: only useful when it's early in the game otherwise it does nothing with damp
[8:06:17] zurdo1988: unless at start
[8:06:20] auchenai7: in equal terms, is imposible for a warr to beat a mage
[8:06:23] OMGWhatsHisFace: nerf ret again pls
[8:06:27] remofreecss: I agree,
[8:06:29] Frequently1: Game is not as fun when spriest is strong, all u do is stand still all game and are invincible because of all ur short def cds
[8:06:29] PastaSeat: RETCHADS we're back
[8:06:39] Mechgyrasaur: I wonder if kubzy's team will do well in AWC with these new changes Kappa
[8:06:43] PastaSeat: Where my FotM bros @??
[8:06:52] crazzbez: @Frequently1 wtf are you talking about
[8:06:58] buffevoker: What is the next Fotm class i need to gear it up now
[8:07:07] rynosaurwow: Outlaw rogue even more broken  now with the armor changes because they deal only physical damage.
[8:07:08] sixthycent: lock
[8:07:15] OMGWhatsHisFace: @Frequently1 game is definitely not fun when rets are strong
[8:07:17] Essalxx: How much armor does your mage have?
[8:07:21] Ambersulfr: sp deserves a meta
[8:07:33] ViDDVuun: DH/RET/RestoDruid is going to be a S+ comp
[8:07:44] ultra_content: ngl @Ambersulfr  sp meta is the less fun meta xo
[8:07:48] blackvpnv: dk already take a lot of dmg
[8:07:51] blackvpnv: ^^
[8:07:52] boundric: woo frost mage lobby!
[8:07:55] valdexxl: ret got nice dmg  buff
[8:08:03] R0NGG: but less damage to range rukiGrin
[8:08:04] Ambersulfr: @ultra_content nope, rdruid
[8:08:19] blackvpnv: maybe time to play ret again
[8:08:19] PastaSeat: Ret damage buff is great for Ret, but Casters getting 30% more armor and 10% more HP is bad for Ret
[8:08:20] dakotan517: the armor changes are actually so bad
[8:08:33] ultra_content: @Ambersulfr for healers ye
[8:08:55] valdexxl: @PastaSeat ret dont care about  armor
[8:09:02] LubD5: They really hate RestoShamans. Why the heck they got armor reduction?
[8:09:02] Arubicon: still at it Ven? you are an animal
[8:09:17] blackvpnv: rsham need to die faster kek
[8:09:20] crazzbez: those armor buffs can't come fast enough
[8:09:21] crazzbez: i swear
[8:09:37] e10100111001: wish I kept that 33% armor on my hpal x.x
[8:09:48] boundric: ret gave you bop
[8:09:49] ooPickleRicKoo: gonna go practice my demo lock.. rsham dream is dead
[8:09:56] blackvpnv: im curious how its gonna impact the meta
[8:10:04] Ambersulfr: hpal is no kidding boned
[8:10:10] Elozern: is glacial build rly worth rn? i feel like in 90% of the games I get max 2 spikes out and all the dmg loss from the icicles over the time is way higher
[8:10:10] LubD5: I recently invested my time in RSham last month lol. Im gonna cry
[8:10:25] serratedlove: isnt ret damage mainly magical though?
[8:10:41] Ambersulfr: it’s partially physical now
[8:10:42] frazzoqt: Think shadow priest gonna be good now?
[8:11:04] ViDDVuun: @amaiyumebaka Holystrike (physical/holy)
[8:11:27] jdawgmyg: Cloth wearers are gonna be as tanky as plate wearers now?
[8:11:54] valdexxl: @amaiyumebaka   depends on armor  .Holystrike works differently
[8:12:06] buffevoker: Where is evoker buffs
[8:12:15] e10100111001: ^ lol
[8:12:38] PastaSeat: Yea I thought Ret damage was Holystrike, which is partially physical, so I assumed Armor affected it. But I could be wrong
[8:12:41] buffevoker: Make Aug Great again blizz
[8:13:15] Magottx: Welp. No more preparation. Tryout tomorrow mornin ven.
[8:13:25] boundric: that looks so rough
[8:13:27] honsou2: this is their usual "lets ruin the game mid season" patch where you unsub until next time. Same as all DF seasons
[8:13:32] crazzbez: you use ice nova for a finisher?
[8:13:40] pure__goat: these fucking changes are a fucking joke
[8:13:48] Magottx: I’m always nervous for shit like this and games then I remember no matter what I get to come home to chill wit my homies in stream and WoW

[8:14:33] RedeemedbyJesus: I subbed to wow for the first time in a long time and am actually enjoying healing in ss right now. There is a light at the end of the queue tunnel.
[8:14:37] Magottx: Wait sub nerfed!? Pog I wanna play it but not if it’s op
[8:14:37] leakyboots25: Anyone think we won't even notice the 35% cloth armor change? 35% of near zero is zero.
[8:14:41] ihavesmokedcrack: Rogues! made that with blades they cant spam 7 point evis! for 250k over and over!
[8:14:41] sourbutts: i think the 10% to evis plus the stamina buff is huge
[8:14:56] dakotan517: @ihavesmokedcrack fr
[8:14:57] OMGWhatsHisFace: @Axtin ok, the cd is now 20s
[8:14:59] wackpoetic: venruki with these patch changes, do you think WW is going to be win more/lose more (i.e. win harder in favorable matchups and lose harder in unfavorable matchups?) the caster buffs and DK nerfs just feel comical for WW
[8:15:03] mac_zo: @RedeemedbyJesus what healer?
[8:15:16] bransby09: Sub rogues damage was kinda meh anyways its there ridiculous control
[8:15:19] Axtin: @OMGWhatsHisFace kekw

[8:15:25] Magottx: Sub will just go back to run and hide between goes meta right?
[8:15:27] ihavesmokedcrack: How about removing BLADE giving insta 7 point evis!!!!!
[8:15:32] aultymalganis: sup with these changes, did you chat about them already? @venruki
[8:15:57] dankgamer97: Wonder how the plate nerf will play out
[8:16:10] PastaSeat: They just need to completely rework Frost DK in PvP I feel like
[8:16:19] sweeziest: dude the armor changes are crazy, locks are going to out-armor plates lmao

[8:16:49] OMGWhatsHisFace: demo needs to just be banned from pvp. pet spam is not fun
[8:17:00] bigmancamx: @sweeziest it’s not additive
[8:17:10] bigmancamx: it’s +35% of what they have
[8:17:17] pure__goat: i play sin ven
[8:17:21] Nonversations: stepbro
[8:17:22] pure__goat: 0 changes for sin
[8:17:26] ValathEU: Have you seen the new pvp changes?
[8:17:30] boundric: It doesn't look like you're having fun in the melee lobby.
[8:17:33] rekt1370: normal shadowplay going to be even crazier
[8:17:39] enviscerate: @pure__goat stam change is good for sin but still squishy
[8:17:42] rekt1370: cause it was good to start with
[8:18:06] CHMage: World of Meleecraft
[8:18:19] Elozern: good ol times when ret was melee

[8:18:27] dragonxzz: Uhm ret buffs are kinda insane unless they forgot to put ''doesnt apply to pvp''
[8:18:29] boundric: this is a good song. very 80s
[8:18:47] Taevenx: Nerf Ret
[8:18:48] Schnellmusic: @boundric The Midnight is the artist, they have like 4 albums are they're all good
[8:18:51] neroxztv: cloth buffs inc
[8:18:54] G00DGooglyMoogly: that glacial felt good I bet
[8:18:57] runnnnnit: bop aint gunna save that
[8:19:04] dakotan517: the nova and root dmg buff is so uncalled for
[8:19:20] Taevenx: greedy boi, hope you're having a good night
[8:19:29] remofreecss: Glacial hás cd?
[8:19:30] PastaSeat: I just want them to nerf how much damage DK Blind can take before breaking
[8:19:34] boundric: @Schnellmusic thanks!
[8:19:39] purek1wi: can someone link changes
[8:19:48] dakotan517: @PastaSeat it can break?
[8:19:56] remofreecss: Just type wowhead on Google @purek1wi
[8:19:56] pure__goat: @enviscerate Yea sin is just not been good all xpac expect the frist 2 weeks on dragonlfight pre deathmark nerf

[8:20:27] Xawo87: "Rigid Ice increases the amount of damage required to cancel Frost Nova by 20% in PvP combat (was 80%)." lol, while a warlock can fear u into DC whilst still nuking u for the full duration xdd
[8:20:27] purek1wi: @bransby09 Ty <3
[8:20:30] enviscerate: @pure__goat sin is decent atm im 2.5 on it, you just have to play very defensively
[8:20:34] yuxywuxy: na bro the cloth buffs and plate nerfs need to be reverted. thats unrealistic lol
[8:21:10] Hyutra: does anyone know how i can get the colored nameplates for the shaman totems ?
[8:21:16] Necrolancer47: damn you been streamin hella
[8:21:23] PastaSeat: I feel like Outlaw and Sin get a bit of a buff with Plate Armor nerf, no? Yea Casters get more Armor, but their armor is already super low
[8:21:34] Thoreya: @Necrolancer47 grind dont stop
[8:21:42] Thoreya: ret is gonna be ridiculous in keys smh
[8:21:45] OMGWhatsHisFace: @PastaSeat imo outlaw and sin are already favored into most plate though
[8:21:51] dankNstein_: anyone else ready to do mythic guldan prog in arenas on reset?
[8:22:01] kovrko: anyone know the song name?
[8:22:06] dragonxzz: lock/sp gonna be sick
[8:22:07] bransby09: I wish void torrent did the damage frost beam does lol
[8:22:28] Thoreya: chat, do we like the new shifting power animation?
[8:22:31] Thoreya: idk how to feel
[8:22:34] Xawo87: caster armor, especially mage armor was nerfed hella back in time, and by a lot.  i have 11.31% now, add another 3-4 % means nothing
[8:22:35] pure__goat: @enviscerate you playing with destro?
[8:22:40] OMGWhatsHisFace: @Thoreya i like it
[8:22:43] rekt1370: shadowplay going to be crazy cloth armor buffs fear buffs
[8:22:52] PastaSeat: @Thoreya I love it and the new Jadefire (Faeline) VFX
[8:22:57] enviscerate: @pure__goat shuffle
[8:23:03] Thoreya: in keys its a lil annoying
[8:23:04] Magottx: It’s Annoying how every good buff for afflic is just better for demo, so it’ll always be way ahead cause also easier to play.
[8:23:06] dragonxzz: @Xawo87 3-4% is not noghing lmao
[8:23:08] OMGWhatsHisFace: gl ven
[8:23:09] Elozern: that round is auto win
[8:23:21] Xawo87: @dragonxzz thats what im saying bruddah, its still ass
[8:23:24] boundric: good luck
[8:23:28] neroxztv: GET IT DONE!!!
[8:23:30] Thoreya: @PastaSeat faeline looks cool af
[8:23:30] rekt1370: demo does like half of affs damage tho
[8:23:49] dragonxzz: @Xawo87 thats decent buff idk what you on about
[8:23:57] Magottx: Not true really when trained and it’s single target a lot so it’s more impactful plus ms
[8:24:05] blackheart1110: How does Ven has small buffs/debuffs on the target/focus frames?
[8:24:48] OMGWhatsHisFace: dk is not favored into ret/war. rough one for spaidz
[8:25:05] Elozern: @OMGWhatsHisFace he should slow melees and pressure sham more
[8:25:11] Xawo87: @dragonxzz decent considering the garbo %age we are at now yes. but have in mind, we got nerfed on armor ages ago and been limping when it comes to tanking a single melee hit
[8:25:32] baconstrippers: girefed
[8:25:32] Das_Publikum: @blackheart1110 you mean the others debuffs being smaller? thats in the options, called dynamic buffs or something
[8:25:34] OMGWhatsHisFace: impressive job by the rsham tbh
[8:25:49] OMGWhatsHisFace: i meant overall
[8:25:51] OMGWhatsHisFace: not that round
[8:25:52] Hyutra: @venruki is that a weakaura that shows colored nameplates for shaman totems ?
[8:25:55] Zenishii: "Im so happy they nerfed shaman armor in pvp" -no one
[8:25:55] boolshow: ret need burf
[8:26:00] cocoteller: The druid looks like he got boosted by some1 else to 2.4
[8:26:02] kovrko: Ven can you check what was the last song name?

[8:26:48] foxyllama: rshams weakness is trained by melee every patch in history
[8:26:50] Frequently1: You are not wrong, ele feels impossible to killl with astral shift and burrow rotation done well
