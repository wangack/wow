[8:50:32] Chompsy: Having streamers and influencers and their friends get beta first is strictly a monetary strategy. Streamers build up hype for the release of games. People pre-order etc. Then the game population goes down in 3 months when the streamers also get bored of it. LUL
[8:50:35] cerealdonut: The only thing I've ever been given for free is Stormwind Brie or whatever the fuck it is

[8:50:53] prodigiousgaming: @jackkolimaga because there isn't in classic right now lol
[8:50:54] DJPodjaK: streamer also plays for 20h a day and can test more
[8:50:55] veryUwU: Basically he's just better then us Sadge
[8:50:55] dizzysfine: indirectly gets to a lot more ppl
[8:50:56] Gunnan22: Depends on what you consider valuable
[8:50:56] Gorkmuk: but i want it reeeee
[8:50:56] deadma0: I mean, at least we get to watch >.>
[8:50:58] I_eat_fried_chicken: true Sadge
[8:50:58] starlite911: i why give it to fat ugly POOR people
[8:50:59] gingerands: sodaYes
[8:51:00] nemzky: not to mention any bugs fround by streamers get WAY more attention
[8:51:02] Hazno: Hellfire Peninsula is such a boring zone aesthetically
[8:51:03] abaranger16: chance "not a brand risk" POGGERS
[8:51:03] Grehgarious: ow i get this"
[8:51:05] Bupkus: It also lets interns watch the stream to see bugs easily
[8:51:06] kindev: W OMEGALUL W ANDYS MALDING OMEGALUL
[8:51:07] MacVane: 🤓 ackshually u guys are beta testers and bug smashers def not for publicity no sir
[8:51:07] caelixxtv: @Harthel It does, that's why there's a 58 boost...
[8:51:09] Kekker_: ngl watching is more fun than playing
[8:51:10] Luminous083: Gotta market a 15 year old game OMEGALUL
[8:51:12] brothafeesh: Hmm i keep checking my battle net for beta and then i realise im a nobody loser
[8:51:14] iJessika: Sadge
[8:51:15] taacoriffic: ya you're kinda a big deal
[8:51:16] DoDRiven: it's true though, cause people will watch the streamers, so it's like they will also "experience" it, therefore reaching a higher number of people
[8:51:19] dabibdo: Hmm
[8:51:21] G00fball8: Pepega
[8:51:21] veryUwU: @Rbn_M You underestimate the no-lifers in this game.
[8:51:21] IThinkThatImkobe: mir got beta so not like only streamers got it anyway
[8:51:22] Anaxai: peepoSmash i'm special too, my mom said so
[8:51:24] m4trio: Big blue soda
[8:51:24] kramerthelamer: they don't even make more money though, people interested in tbc classic were going to play it regardless
[8:51:24] rowdyrout: That's why i downloaded RAID SHADOW LEGENDS: SHADOWTASTIC EXPANSIONtm
[8:51:25] SoFisht: people streaming beta means chat can see glitches the player might not too, so its better for testing and marketting
[8:51:25] Fossabot: sodaKEVIN Did you know you get a free subscription when you link your Amazon Prime account with Twitch? You can sub to Chance for free and spam emotes all day! sodaL sodaH sodaH - https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2574674-how-to-use-twitch-prime-free-subscriptions
[8:51:25] greppi147: it's not sad lmao, if some random dipshit got it we wouldn't be able to watch the gameplay
[8:51:26] sanyassan: a lot more people enjoy the access this way, technically
[8:51:26] theonyxzero: Nah depends on the random person. A retail streamer who hardly played classic over someone who put hundreds and hundreds of hours into classic
[8:51:27] G00fball8: Pog he did it
[8:51:30] thegrinder_27: Hmm imagine if jeff quit the overwatch team and came back to wow
[8:51:35] Harthel: @caelixxtv No. Theres a boost so they will make money
[8:51:35] Meshugunah: monkaW
[8:51:36] I_eat_fried_chicken: Hmm really makes you think
[8:51:37] Anaxai: peepoSmash i'm special too, my mom said so.
[8:51:38] RawTopRamen: its almost like the testers are in a strange way paid to test the game again lol
[8:51:38] G00fball8: thats such a sick name
[8:51:42] giinby: he hungers
[8:51:43] Skyezz19: Cant wait until I leave Hellfire peninsula when its out
[8:51:45] veryUwU: @sodapoppin My only counter argument is you can give it to more then what looks like 15 people...
[8:51:46] Bubonicc: you face galaxis
[8:51:48] Dogarian: Pog baron geddon
[8:51:48] caelixxtv: @Harthel From the people that they pull in from marketing.

[8:51:54] sedael: LULW
[8:51:55] xithus: Hmm he a bitch tho
[8:51:55] kpt58: blizzard wants hype for both tbc and eyes on wow in general.  streamers make that happen.  anyone angry at that might as well just be angry at the world.
[8:51:55] Shepp22: Blizzard could give a beta key to an absolute noob and then follow them on an invisible GM for game research
[8:51:56] edamsmeeth: This is some real feelsgoodman vibes sodaAYAYA
[8:52:03] Vikitorus: Why did you change forms for 1 sec?

[8:52:16] easternhubris: @Shepp22  why do you think they gave key to soda :) ?
[8:52:17] Hogings: FeelsDankMan
[8:52:19] prodigiousgaming: @harthel FailFish
[8:52:21] Chompsy: @EmptyEmo That's exactly what the advertising is. It's making people feel like they're missing out so they in turn resub to not be missing out.
[8:52:22] Game_Forger: sodaL @chat
[8:52:23] Vastatio: @Shepp22 lol
[8:52:26] DoDRiven: @Vikitorusss it's called "cat weaving" he leaves cat and re-enters to regen energy from talent.

[8:52:51] Dogarian: @DoDRiven @Vikitorusss and from his helmet too
[8:52:52] TomGarden: @TaylorB_43 no
[8:52:53] GIANNI04: r u gonna stream all night? @sodapoppin

[8:53:14] starlite911: lol no amount of weaving can make feral viable in TBC raids
[8:53:15] veryUwU: @kochonn Replaced by questing blues
[8:53:15] nemzky: @sodapoppin they said theyre increasing it in a few days
[8:53:17] VIKTOK: yeah I think tbc will have 70 cap or something
[8:53:19] thepegge: They said they will remove cap in the next couple days @sodapoppin

[8:53:48] Mizzle__: doubtful
[8:53:48] xwestonxx: @sodapoppin you playing moon boy since feral is shit or nah?
[8:53:48] thegrinder_27: Honestly they should cap 64 for beta and then let everyone play preseason. Its either that or they lock beta gear to strictly beta gear and nothing else
[8:53:48] nidhalws: farm rep in lvl 64
[8:53:50] Dogarian: @DoDRiven im just glad edgies arent bis for warrior anymore LUL

[8:54:02] brothafeesh: @loginuts its available at 60 but so far you cant do it in beta
[8:54:03] Uriskall: @loginuts yeah you can skirmish other people
[8:54:05] Slabhead2Barca: @kochonn u can probably raid kara in full naxx gear but what's the point when you can get better gear from quests
[8:54:05] DMGlol: 8 hours and only 1 level higher? sodaThink
[8:54:07] SoFisht: omen Kreygasm
[8:54:08] weavling: it will just be nax gear at 64

[8:54:24] Karmonger: speedweedlll can't even enter anywhere in tbc

[8:54:35] Mc2Dee: Dababy plays LoL?
[8:54:36] Hazno: @1BadBrew when they've done both classic and tbc, most definitely
[8:54:46] Port_city_pirate: dudududududududu
[8:54:56] Dogarian: @DoDRiven edgemasters handguards, the + weapon skill gloves
[8:54:58] Moexotv: yea i rather big and empty then small and hard to navigate
[8:54:58] Evil_Alch: wow grats on 61 already
[8:54:59] Noodli_: Will you be playing feral arenas at 70 soda? Pog
[8:54:59] Eean: I thought in TBC you could interact in form?
[8:55:01] beastaa3: Hmm
[8:55:03] ForeignGamer: @Moexotv i mean these old zones are kind of just empty
[8:55:03] kochonn: Is it better to farm gold in classic or to get naxx gear then ? I imagine having 280% speed up the farming process for bis in TBC
[8:55:05] Billgrump: Moexotv too be fair these zones don't have much detail to them compared to modern zones.
[8:55:05] easternhubris: Why they even capped since it's beta ? like what are they trying to achieve
[8:55:07] pedrodaboch4: did you liked shadowlands soda?
[8:55:08] Uglytoes: BfA classic when?
[8:55:08] Sockerkorn: How is it playing WoW on Singleplayer Sodapoppin

[8:55:18] Qruara: @Do you prefer expansions where the areas are more open like this? or more condensed?
[8:55:19] G00fball8: i think that was in cata
[8:55:20] Skyezz19: @Moexotv Big and empty are the worst zones imo
[8:55:23] BstaySG: You can pick herbs
[8:55:24] TomGarden: @Moexotv the difference is outlands zone kept you there for a week or a month, shadowlands has you go from region to region every second
[8:55:24] planooooooooooooooooooooo: @sodapoppin will you be going for level 70 or what is the big objective here? thank you
[8:55:25] kcm92: How bad do you think bg ques will be on the horde side in tbc

[8:55:40] Moexotv: big zones make the xpac feel bigger.. I dont care that they are empty
