At first I was taken by surprise by these feelings. Without even realizing it, I let this hate for the homeless build, stream after stream. And eventually, what was bound to happen, happened. I found myself on a late night kicking a homeless man. It felt so wrong, I wanted to puke. But this was what Graycen wanted.
[4:15:15] Trodenskjold: Optimus_prime: an old lady just had a heartattack outside my house, i saw it from the window while watching your stream. The ambulance people said that she was lucky she wasnt watching Graycen like me. Guess i took one for the team. Sadge

[4:36:44] Thedruidtyler: Some of you have been asking: what's correct grammatically: "cuter" or "more cute"? and the answer is "cuter." The reason why is that the word cute is an adjective, a word that describes something, and when you compare something and the adjective ends in an "e" like cute you add an "r" so "cute" becomes "cuter".

[7:07:50] RushTurok: katie: Phimosis surgery, or circumcision, involves prepuce excision via dorsal slit or full circumcision techniques under anesthesia. Post-op care includes analgesics and antibiotics for discomfort, swelling, and hemorrhage. Recovery spans weeks with vigilance for infection, hemorrhage, and wound dehiscence. Follow-up appointments monitor and manage complications. Circumcision efficacy is offset by infection, hemorrhage, and sensory alterations risks.
