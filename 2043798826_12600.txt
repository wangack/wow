I can't play this dogshit game.", tears roll from his cheeks as he cries. Lynn comforts "Its ok sweetheart just a few more years of league and you can retire.". Thinking about a future of freely playing Lost Ark 16 hours a day, sneaky gathers his courage, "You are right. I can take this". He returns, puts on headphone "Im back chat".

[5:44:00] unclepecos: What I think sets Tekken apart from other games in the genre is that it's committed to delivering the experience that the devs intended, rather than pandering to its clueless playerbase. Take it's very first screen, for example. Most games would say "Connecting to server..." but Tekken simply says "Connecting to server." No elipses, just a full stop. It WILL connect to the server. You WILL get your ass beat by an anime girl. You have no choice

[6:29:59] Gargantix: @DahnGore *senna, wtf is wrong with my hands
[6:30:05] scornfulbladeofficial: lich instead of essence?
[6:30:11] unclepecos: oh sneaky you were asking when muramana's damage was split into basics and abilities, it was patch 11.5
[6:30:14] Exdramatic: i mean at this point u have so much haste
[6:30:18] areallystalememe: seemed pretty good that game but every build probably is good when you're that fed
[6:30:19] MinhooMinh: 15% scale Dentge
[6:30:26] juice03_: Lich is less damage all game
[6:30:26] 4shizzyy: and fuck it go seraphs over manamune
[6:30:30] lizziemynizzie: riftmaker?
[6:30:31] 4shizzyy: fuck it just play ap ez
[6:30:36] juice03_: Essence out damages lich at every point
[6:30:36] S3xyNugget_69: riftmaker rush maybe
[6:30:37] tosuarus: manamune with a sheen i guess
[6:30:38] juice03_: by a lot
[6:30:38] BestAnnie: theorycrafter sneky
[6:30:45] unclepecos: you're also gonna have mana issues without essence right?
[6:30:47] smurfingpenguin: check ap dmg
[6:30:49] bluestone2000: GETALIFE YAKUZA
[6:30:50] juice03_: They buffed 3 AD ratio's and people start playing ap? XD @sneakylol
[6:30:55] 4shizzyy: 350 hp and 15 haste
[6:30:56] weisxs: @juice03_ do you have any graphs to support this claim

[6:31:33] yamichan77: CUM
[6:31:33] Matthew21210: I think the %increased damage is additive, but... The pure damage/%max health from both is strong against tanks right?
[6:31:37] hazardfish: check ap damage
[6:31:38] S3xyNugget_69: @lizziemynizzie yeah
[6:31:44] S3xyNugget_69: @Deadmoonlight MONKA
[6:31:53] mista_trixter: Feels redundant they should combine them in one item
