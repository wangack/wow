I can't play this dogshit game.", tears roll from his cheeks as he cries. Lynn comforts "Its ok sweetheart just a few more years of league and you can retire.". Thinking about a future of freely playing Lost Ark 16 hours a day, sneaky gathers his courage, "You are right. I can take this". He returns, puts on headphone "Im back chat".

[5:44:00] unclepecos: What I think sets Tekken apart from other games in the genre is that it's committed to delivering the experience that the devs intended, rather than pandering to its clueless playerbase. Take it's very first screen, for example. Most games would say "Connecting to server..." but Tekken simply says "Connecting to server." No elipses, just a full stop. It WILL connect to the server. You WILL get your ass beat by an anime girl. You have no choice
