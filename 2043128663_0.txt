[0:15:08] Suze_o_0: ooooooooooook my PC just randomly shut down WTF
[0:15:09] MachoCham: Seen that GUNTHER is now bookies favourite for the Rumble?
[0:15:15] Pandachoww: its all set up...with the tape...on the box sean
[0:15:18] MediumRareOG: Branding a box like that is a good way to get it stolen so the packaging is always plain
[0:15:24] MachoCham: I can volunteer?
[0:15:33] Suze_o_0: what is, what i miss?
[0:15:36] Pandachoww: jesus christ thats not smol
[0:15:38] Nilzours: deiiNotes MrGm doesn't mind heavy guitars good to know. Better make him check out power metal deiiNotes
[0:15:40] S3N71: Liquid cooled?

[0:17:25] grump42: Hello
[0:17:30] lyreilla: HaHa I am a big user of those @suze_o_0
[0:17:48] Nilzours: Ye Power Metal is good stuff. Most bands sing about magic, dragons, warriors, gods, basically everything that comes to mind when thinking of general fantasy stuff. Is good
[0:17:48] Pandachoww: mate shes such a tease holly aint she
[0:17:56] Jelky55: we got spoiled with all those good news that we are worried if we get 1 silent week :p
[0:18:01] JaviHeals: @Pandachoww naught yHolly
[0:18:09] Suze_o_0: @lyreilla yes, so i my mum, and she expects me to know what she is talking about lol
[0:18:30] JaviHeals: I think the roadmap was such a dopamine hit we're all now addicted
[0:18:31] Pandachoww: @Nilzours reasons i love parkway drive so much....they just sing about the ocean and surfing and that
[0:18:44] Jelky55: havent checked the video yet xd
[0:18:57] viscka_games: oh I am done with nokud offensive as of last night too!!! grats!!!
[0:19:01] JaviHeals: I haven't watched the video yet but already understand the title and what you mean.... thought it was a great idea lol
[0:19:08] Azenitor: titles fine dude
[0:19:23] Molly336: You are blurry Dan :)
[0:19:24] Pandachoww: you mean "not good offensive" ha
[0:19:33] JaviHeals: Yeah was big brain honestly
[0:19:33] Nilzours: @Pandachoww They do? haven't really listened to them much. I heard hammerfall when I was 11 been stuck in the power metal world since. Almost 27 now KEKW
[0:19:37] Pandachoww: yeah i thought he was a bit aswell
[0:19:43] ImperfectDark: i ran a follower dungeon to craft something at the altar of decay. Was handy
[0:19:50] Molly336: its good!
[0:19:55] Jelky55: deadly stare
[0:19:57] lyreilla: You are fore
[0:20:04] lyreilla: *for me
[0:20:17] JaviHeals: @ImperfectDark ooooo good idea!!!
[0:20:18] emmby_: o/
[0:20:21] CerebrillUK: hey there
[0:20:22] Pandachoww: @Nilzours yeah they did a documentary a few years ago where they were like "yeah other bands songs are about love and relationships and all that shit, we just go on about the sea, surf and shit we love doing!"
[0:20:23] Jelky55: my name is purple so im Epic, not legendary
[0:20:24] BBMezzy: mrgmLunaPog
[0:20:27] Xesol: hello
[0:20:28] Suze_o_0: i was contemplating doing follower dungeon, will the tank lead the way? lmao i get lost
[0:20:34] wildwittra: Hey
[0:20:34] Haestoh: yo yo
[0:20:53] Nilzours: @Pandachoww nice. That's the way to do it. valaer1POG CoolCat
[0:20:56] Suze_o_0: oh ty !
[0:21:07] Paranigmayt: welcome sir
[0:21:26] S3N71: Is it a mount?
[0:22:35] Pandachoww: oh i love it

[0:22:51] S3N71: Ah man, now I'm going to have to get that using followers as well
[0:23:01] databob1: Allo
[0:23:05] FrankkLeTank: Pretty good and yourself!
[0:23:07] Kaaluu1: Druid flight form for everyone
[0:23:23] Jelky55: the otter i got by queing LFR Vault raid and rolled need on items and had to ignore all whispers asking "do you need?" i felt sorry for ppl a bit but hey..mount count xD
[0:24:19] Pandachoww: i hope so, we need something XD
[0:25:10] Azenitor: nice to see the devs hyped for the game again
[0:26:15] Breakthecause: I just think social media has changed since then
[0:26:19] RAF_Sean: I prefer them being able to show their excitement and engage
[0:26:21] JaviHeals: Speaking of PTR and Dev's... I just read Zygor's blog update and saw they were saying about the increasing trend of content locked PTR's
[0:26:38] michaelmm: I have a suspicion that having a VP that streams and is active on twitter's probably changed the corporate attitude to devs engaging with the community.
[0:26:44] RAF_Sean: Just need to make sure the chuds don‚Äôt eat their lunch for it
[0:27:21] michaelmm: Mike Yabarra has a twitch stream.
[0:27:21] RAF_Sean: Qwik
[0:27:35] michaelmm: Not so much recently.
[0:27:37] Xesol: he has been strangely quiet
[0:27:49] RAF_Sean: Too busy negotiating his taking over for Bobby
[0:28:04] michaelmm: Also the community's vibe towards the devs are more positive.
[0:28:27] RAF_Sean: Guess who forgot to order Anjulee a monitor when he ordered her PC
[0:28:46] RAF_Sean: I‚Äôm a bad
[0:29:13] RAF_Sean: Can you just change the caps to something quieter?
[0:29:19] Suze_o_0: @RAF_Sean oh no!
[0:29:22] michaelmm: I was comparing peak BfA/SL negativity with now. The Archives is a minor blemish compared to the communtiy attitude back around 9.1 for example.
[0:29:27] S3N71: My laptop has a mechanical keyboard, that's pretty damn loud
[0:29:37] lyreilla: Is there Asmon drama recently? I didn't get much time to stalk things yesterday.
[0:29:40] Pandachoww: everything of mines failing at the same time....need a new mousepad, headset and mic
[0:30:18] RAF_Sean: Panda out here shredding mousepads
[0:30:22] Pandachoww: just wear and tear....the rubbers coming through and its screwing up my movement
[0:30:24] Haestoh: I have the same keyboard and mouse from 2014. Razer Blackwidow and Naga, both work like the day I bought them
[0:31:03] RAF_Sean: Stream goal?
[0:31:06] Pandachoww: also i wanna switch from a mouspad to an actual deskpad...
[0:31:22] BusterDonuts: Did you send that tweet about the mobile barbershop or glyph of random warlock appearance
[0:31:32] Haestoh: ‚Äúdonate to help my baby sleep better.‚Äù mrgmKEKW mrgmKEKW mrgmKEKW

[0:32:07] RAF_Sean: Don‚Äôt ask for a new keyboard just fire out a tweet asking for ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù for a new quiet one
[0:32:19] twomoealice: how about new pc casesÔºü
[0:32:20] RAF_Sean: Then let them offer you üòâ
[0:32:54] RAF_Sean: Did the new PC come with a keyboard?
[0:33:12] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:33:32] MediumRareOG: I honestly don't understand why people are mad at Asmon about this
[0:33:32] twomoealice: the brand is cases brand
[0:33:36] calphan84: hopefully you don't get a broken pc in it like when i ordered my computer
[0:34:02] RAF_Sean: Oh we judging‚Ä¶
[0:34:04] S3N71: @MediumRareOG What's Asmon done / said?
[0:34:29] emarol_dk: lol :D
[0:34:30] RAF_Sean: Oof
[0:34:33] BBMezzy: mrgmHehe
[0:34:36] Haestoh: Hahahahahaha
[0:34:38] S3N71: Busted!
[0:34:38] LaMu2560: lol
[0:34:47] wildwittra: priorities !
[0:34:47] RAF_Sean: drexlRIP
[0:34:47] MediumRareOG: @S3N71 You can look it up but basically he just said the only thing that matters with games is the players opinion. The artists don't matter. And people are mad
[0:34:48] lyreilla: Ruh Oh
[0:35:28] Vengeful_Hermit: You're the second person I've seen use Zygor. I thought that was just for leveling. Are there a bunch of options that help for completion?
[0:35:40] RAF_Sean: Nice!
[0:36:19] S3N71: I'm on day four of diarrhoea and  vomiting and have had to tighten my belt.  Not going to weigh myself, unhealthy weight loss doesn't count
[0:36:28] RAF_Sean: Zygor is legit the best addon for levelling and/or completion content
[0:36:32] MediumRareOG: Dan, what's your Zygor code do? Is it 20% off for a month? A year? Forever?
[0:36:46] ryer__: how many % you got on "all the things" overall?
[0:36:56] RAF_Sean: It‚Äôs usually a one time fee per expansion
[0:37:01] ryer__: 75 damn
[0:37:04] amricatt: It wouldn't let me apply to an annual plan.  Just monthly
[0:37:28] Vengeful_Hermit: Not bad.
[0:37:33] CerebrillUK: is ATT just achievements or transmog collection also?  ive always been an achievement hunter but less so on tmog
[0:37:39] Vengeful_Hermit: Been trying to find people who do competion.
[0:37:47] amricatt: I stopped it after a month because I took a break so I'm not sure if the discount was just one month.
[0:38:18] MediumRareOG: You don't have the ATT pet battles... YET
[0:38:22] Vengeful_Hermit: Been bored as I've been waiting for the next expansion before I grind a bunch of transmog with the new rules.
[0:38:50] Larkaro: Only 2057, thats fast
[0:39:02] nuclearphosphate: @Vengeful_Hermit new rules?
[0:39:13] Vengeful_Hermit: pet collecting. At 1.3k pets collected.
[0:39:16] BBMezzy: What else but dig of course!
[0:39:27] ryer__: you dont get it by just plaing while streaming ?
[0:39:42] nuclearphosphate: @Vengeful_Hermit what new rules?
[0:40:18] ryer__: you cant mute stream
[0:40:20] nuclearphosphate: yeah if you mute the stream, it doesnt count towards twitch drops
[0:40:21] ryer__: you can mute tab
[0:40:25] BBMezzy: Stream muting stops progess, you need to mute the tab
[0:40:26] Azenitor: @nuclearphosphate pick vulpera insta ban
[0:40:32] nuclearphosphate: tab can be muted, just not the stream
[0:40:37] ryer__: it worked for me for most drops
[0:40:37] nuclearphosphate: @Azenitor eh?
[0:41:03] ryer__: that is kinda bs that you dont get progress by streaming ^_^
[0:41:12] Azenitor: @nuclearphosphate dumb humor ignore me
[0:41:31] S3N71: Just hit 24 on my SoD Feral Druid :)
[0:41:32] flyingdutchw: OEF breaking news: Microsoft cutting 1900 Xbox + ABK employee jobs
[0:41:36] ryer__: for farm vulr is the best
[0:41:43] ryer__: vulp*
[0:41:55] MediumRareOG: the vulpera camp racial is great
[0:41:58] flyingdutchw: check the verge
[0:42:09] Azenitor: seems to be the trend in the industry, riot just layed off a load of employees
[0:42:33] ryer__: damn !
[0:42:37] RAF_Sean: Fuck
[0:42:37] amricatt: I actually really like vulpera.  I didn't think I would since I don't like goblins.
[0:42:39] Larkaro: WoW is dead

[0:43:10] flyingdutchw: tbf was to be expected after all the takeovers
[0:43:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:43:16] RAF_Sean: To be fair we had to expect some downsizing of redundant roles after the merger
[0:43:45] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies üß° https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[0:43:45] amricatt: Mergers always end in layoffs.  There tends to be too many peeps unfortunately.
[0:43:56] MysticalOS: mentioning 22k is PR for making 1900 seems smaller
[0:44:10] Azenitor: yeah
[0:44:11] S3N71: Maybe that's why Mike has been so quiet :|
[0:44:22] flyingdutchw: lots of Admin staff that they have double off now with owning ABK
[0:44:40] MysticalOS: yeah with any merger is a culling of redundancy, but that number is more than just admin redundancy
[0:44:56] flyingdutchw: this is going to hit WoW for sure
[0:44:58] wildwittra: i wonder if Microsoft will have people re-apply for their job
[0:44:59] MysticalOS: they probably also trimmed fat. poor performing game assessments
[0:45:09] Breakthecause: Here comes AI
[0:45:39] wildwittra: "so sadge to hear the news ..."
[0:45:47] flyingdutchw: Bell already tweeted
[0:47:20] CerebrillUK: probably before the stock market goes live in a few min (930am est)
[0:47:26] CerebrillUK: man thats brutal
[0:47:49] MysticalOS: i'm surprised it came out today. probably leaks and forced to PR it early. most layoffs try to target friday going into weekend, cause it is best for falling out of news cycle and stock market is closed over weekend
[0:47:57] databob1: good thing we got rid of Bobby. now nothing bad will happen now that bobbies gone
[0:48:13] rottweilerforlive: tuesday come the numbers from Microsoft
[0:48:19] RAF_Sean: QA, community managers, social teams likely most at risk no?
[0:48:29] MediumRareOG: The stockmarket loves layoffs
[0:48:34] Kimdah_: Lots of layoffs already this year
[0:48:39] RAF_Sean: No I‚Äôm asking
[0:48:40] rottweilerforlive: quarter
[0:48:45] rottweilerforlive: 'tuesday
[0:48:58] rottweilerforlive: next week
[0:49:04] lyreilla: Our company's earnings release is today.
[0:49:10] MysticalOS: those are most at risk. when companies merge, they eliminate redundancies. QA, customer service, market managers, community managers, publishing
[0:49:23] nuclearphosphate: "record profits this year everyone, having said that, heres the door"
[0:49:26] royos__: been through many takeovers  accounts admin and middle management first on the list

[0:49:44] Everit: what addon are you using for your quests? has the navigation arrow above your action bars
[0:49:46] flyingdutchw: MS already booted 10K employees last year across many other divisions
[0:50:01] Everit: rip ad :(
[0:50:03] nuclearphosphate: @Everit its a paid addon called Zygor
[0:50:16] Everit: @nuclearphosphate thank you!
[0:50:25] jonnysaurus6: "I really hope..." BAM ad xD
[0:50:25] Layliah79: i bet a lot of the Blizzard staff already knew once they merged.
[0:50:52] nuclearphosphate: @MrGM ive had achievements not register certain aspects and unlock regardless in this
[0:50:58] wildwittra: same here in our company. we are now down-sizing to get better result so the company more easily can be sold. less people need to do more work....
[0:51:12] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:31] Kimdah_: Kimdah_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:51:48] Kimdah_: Three months upfront ‚ú®
[0:51:58] nuclearphosphate: thats probably hitting the nail on the head, cause more people play video games, when soemthing like that happens, you WILL hear about it
[0:52:15] Kimdah_: 24 months now
[0:52:44] MediumRareOG: I kinda suspect Microsoft bought Activision mainly for CoD
[0:52:49] JakeSezz: Just saw your tweet about the layoffs and realized I hadn‚Äôt hopped into stream
[0:52:49] Larkaro: maybe its none of the wow team and all the call of duty devs
[0:53:07] JakeSezz: Man, Ghostcrawler sounded pretty pissed/devastated
[0:53:31] Kimdah_: CoD has been under fire especially since Warzone was messed up big time
[0:53:55] jhopps12: I wonder if we will know which studio was impacted the most
[0:53:57] Kimdah_: Warzone literally BROKE after an update
[0:54:18] fooxytv: Hey Dan!
[0:54:32] fooxytv: today! :)
[0:54:32] BBMezzy: Ybarra just tweeted
[0:54:34] Vengeful_Hermit: So with Zygor can you load multiple guides at once to do everything in a zone?
[0:54:37] royos__: players want more for less $$$ share holders want more return $$$ always going to be a negative push back somewhere in the chain
[0:54:41] fooxytv: Thank you
[0:54:44] S3N71: @fooxytv Happy birthday!
[0:54:45] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS from Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[0:54:46] flyingdutchw: Windows Central article on this is a bit better and easier to read
[0:54:49] amricatt: @fooxytv Happy Birthday!!
[0:54:50] Jelky55: Ybarra prolly watching ur stream rn
[0:55:00] Larkaro: oh no
[0:55:02] fooxytv: fooxytv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:55:06] nuclearphosphate: he says he is resigning
[0:55:09] lunamists: what
[0:55:13] flyingdutchw: aaaand thats why he was quiet
[0:55:20] stregnor: Venveful - you can load multiple guides, but the navigation arrow only directs you for the one that is currently active at that time.
[0:55:21] amricatt: Oh wow.
[0:55:22] fooxytv: Thanks chat <3
[0:55:25] Kimdah_: WHAT?
[0:55:40] amricatt: What a day.
[0:55:45] RAF_Sean: He did leave Microsoft before
[0:55:48] Hotstitute: 4 presidents in 6 years
[0:56:44] flyingdutchw: tbf what Ybarra did to his former female co-lead was horrendous
[0:56:59] Hotstitute: i mean, thinking about it, you give president and COO to Metzan right?
[0:57:07] RAF_Sean: Dan for president?
[0:57:12] Layliah79: OMG i'm so sad.
[0:57:33] Rokir_: I can't believe Ybarra is gone
[0:57:35] Rokir_: Insanity
[0:57:36] wildwittra: Holly Longdale still there ?
[0:57:37] MediumRareOG: @flyingdutchw I don't know what you think happened but it doesn't match what actually happened
[0:57:56] JakeSezz: mrgmNotLikeThis mrgmNotLikeThis mrgmNotLikeThis
[0:57:59] databob1: dead game all doomed the good times are over
[0:57:59] Layliah79: we can't lose the OG crew too
[0:58:00] Larkaro: I am shook. I cant feel
[0:58:09] Xesol: damn we kinda jinxed that huh?
[0:58:10] stregnor: Anyone got a link to that tweet?
[0:58:13] MysticalOS: well that explains high number, they canned survival game too
[0:58:19] MysticalOS: so yeah that's an entire dev team they can let go
[0:58:30] MrEvilRex: hello
[0:58:31] MysticalOS: the verge post updated
[0:58:32] Jelky55: then whats with all this friendship at blizzcon and building future together? ...
[0:59:22] fooxytv: that's a strange tweet, something must have happened? or he's decided to jump ship
[0:59:26] MrEvilRex: @Jelky55 the friendship is between the C level execs and Shareholders
[0:59:32] LaMu2560: Allen Adham, also left
[0:59:36] RAF_Sean: He was probably laid off
[0:59:40] lyreilla: Shit! What did I miss? Had to take a work call.
[0:59:54] Layliah79: Phil said a while back that Mike would continue leading the Blizzard team
[0:59:56] Layliah79: WTF
[1:00:22] databob1: and they canceled the survival game....Fuck microsoft I knew this was going to go to shit
[1:00:26] Valestrus: grave news... dark times..
[1:00:27] Valestrus: :(
[1:00:35] MrEvilRex: would be funny if his account was hacked
[1:00:43] MysticalOS: https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050297/blizzard-survival-game-cancelled-layoffs
[1:00:45] shaypressplay: laying off 1900 is a lot
[1:00:57] Layliah79: Did Microsoft play us?
[1:01:03] Xesol: @Layliah79 thats what everyone says during a takeover, then afterwards mrgmSad
[1:01:14] Jelky55: i've read Booty as Bobby...
[1:01:20] Jelky55: lmao
[1:01:27] ChrisStoll: 1900 people is crazy. I wonder who else is affected
[1:02:05] lunamists: I wonder who they'll appoint as president though
[1:02:07] MrEvilRex: @ChrisStoll probably no the copilot team, they tryna shove that thing down every avenue
[1:02:08] Jelky55: so those are some news for wow huh...
[1:02:14] Nightfright7: Big news
[1:02:20] Layliah79: Ion?! :D
[1:02:25] Layliah79: Or Holly
[1:02:34] JakeSezz: This better turn out to be a ‚Äúdevil you know is better than the devil you don‚Äôt‚Äù type of situation. No way this can be worse than with Bobby‚Ä¶.right?
[1:02:38] Breakthecause: John Hight?
[1:02:42] Layliah79: I would be okay with Holly or John
[1:02:43] JakeSezz: *better not
[1:02:43] shaypressplay: gives that skull and cross bone flag a new meaning :(

[1:03:04] Rokir_: Sucks to hear about the survival game, was looking forward to a new IP
[1:03:10] NeeK_23: Anne Stickney found out from T&E not her own company
[1:03:17] Larkaro: I actually feel a little sick now
[1:03:33] databob1: if microsoft screws with wow I will be livid
[1:03:47] amricatt: Almost 7
[1:03:49] michaelmm: It's only 6:45 AM in LA - few will know yet.
[1:03:50] NeeK_23: just starting I guess
[1:03:54] JakeSezz: 0643
[1:04:00] michaelmm: They are literally gonna find out via twitter
[1:04:34] wildwittra: another great day in paradise :-(
[1:04:40] databob1: so now we know what the pirate flag is. microsoft pillaging blizzard
[1:04:45] Bears_Adventures: Just heard the news :( Its so awful x
[1:04:47] Grzmocillla: damn what that means for blizzard games ?
[1:04:58] MediumRareOG: another win for capitalism
[1:05:04] houssin10: first riot now blizzard. whats happening?
[1:05:04] Valestrus: very awful news :(
[1:05:22] NeeK_23: @databob1 ooof fuck yeah thats bad timing
[1:05:24] Paranigmayt: All of us
[1:05:25] Jelky55: was looking forward to that survival game
[1:05:36] Larkaro: I wonder if anything from it will ever been seen
[1:05:37] JakeSezz: Yup! @mediumrareog The corporate machine keeps grinding, both in movement and the bones of their employees
[1:05:41] snowmiser593: How much of it is company overlap from positions that Microsoft already had filled from before the acquisitions?
[1:05:46] MediumRareOG: the survival game getting canned is almost good for wow because it means the blizard layoffs were heavily weighted towards the survival game team
[1:05:46] NIICKLAS_TV: this is sad
[1:05:47] MysticalOS: i suspect it won't impact wow at all. they woulda culled from as I said the non dev team staff, outside of survival game people.
[1:06:02] databob1: @NeeK_23 I know
[1:06:20] ChaosEternal: This has been going on for a while now. It's tech-industry-wide.
[1:06:23] IAmScarlett__: im just hoping it doesnt impact wow
[1:06:25] Layliah79: So Mike is done after today?
[1:06:33] Grzmocillla: Imagine IOn got fired
[1:06:38] NeeK_23: yeah Mike is gone
[1:06:39] ExcelsisEU: 8% of game-workplaces
[1:06:41] MysticalOS: wow is in great shape. and a great future. if they culled from anywhere else it'd be diablo and overwatch.
[1:06:43] Layliah79: They have to announce his replacement this week
[1:06:44] NIICKLAS_TV: didnt this just happen to riot too?
[1:06:55] snowmiser593: Did I miss you opening that Lian Li case?
[1:06:58] houssin10: @IAmScarlett__ it will 100% impact wow we just dont know by how much. could be very insignifiscant.
[1:07:03] NeeK_23: riot got 10% laid off on monday
[1:07:05] IAmScarlett__: @NIICKLAS_TV this literally happened 2 days ago with riot
[1:07:15] databob1: fuck me this is depressing
[1:07:20] snowmiser593: For sure!
[1:07:23] ChaosEternal: And EA as well as several other major companies in recent weeks/months iirc.
[1:07:25] Layliah79: Yeah i'm depressed about Mike
[1:07:31] flyingdutchw: cutting 1900 ppl at the start of 2024 and Satya NAdella earned 48.5M last year

[1:08:03] MysticalOS: microsoft CEO
[1:08:06] Jelky55: what if all of this was pre planned when he got his job at Blizzard and he will stay around but due to NDAs he cant say much @MrGM  ?
[1:08:07] flyingdutchw: CEO of MS
[1:08:35] sufferzgb: wait what happened?

[1:09:34] databob1: at least people at Mikes level tend to move on to similar opportunities.. hopefully the people that get laid off will have similar luck
[1:09:52] stregnor: Does anyone have that link to Ybarra's message on twitter? It's not showing on his status page
[1:11:05] Bears_Adventures: Ah, not allowed to link. Sorry. I got timed out! Sorry Dan! :D
[1:11:17] databob1: why did laid off get sensored??

[1:15:01] Valestrus: (apart from the  terrible news)
[1:15:02] Matrixovershock: rough morning matrix2DOH
[1:15:15] fooxytv: MrGM knew.. O.O
[1:15:17] Xesol: foot in mouth lol
[1:15:22] MrEvilRex: faience? so u mean ur shield is a is a B...Ba....*faints*
[1:15:25] NIICKLAS_TV: that pirate skull didnt mean pirates
[1:15:29] MrEvilRex: child*
[1:15:32] Breakthecause: Yeah, they can't shadowdrop 10.2.6 news today.
[1:15:37] Matrixovershock: ooof
[1:15:46] databob1: @mrgm oops....I'm gonna go drink myself stupid cause I don't wanna deal with this shit
[1:15:57] SNAKEBOMBS22: what did pirate skull mean
[1:16:07] ChrisStoll: They totally would drop news just to cover layoff news
[1:16:10] MrEvilRex: nvm typo ruined it
[1:16:11] Smurflord: what happened?
[1:16:15] adampanerabread: yo!
[1:16:30] Matrixovershock: massive layoff
[1:16:48] NIICKLAS_TV: insane amount
[1:17:07] databob1: @mrgm I literally only have a mini bottle of Captain Morgans in the house any
[1:17:08] MrEvilRex: yh there is a genocide going on but some ppl fired is what causes some ppl to drink?!!
[1:17:37] MysticalOS: https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1750533230942454011?s=20
[1:17:41] databob1: @mrgm yeah your probably right
[1:17:42] jhopps12: did we see that Allen Adham,  the chief design officer, is out too?
[1:17:44] Talason: why did mike leave
[1:17:47] Raekz: Raekz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! pandatv7777
[1:18:18] Smurflord: Expected to be honest. Too many studios over-hired during the boom time of the pandemic, and now they're paying the price. (saying this as someone who went through this and got made redundant) It sucks but it's understandable.
[1:18:34] Jelky55: can u imagine Metzen is one of them...........
[1:18:35] RAF_Sean: I wonder if he left because of the layoffs
[1:18:36] Jelky55: bruh
[1:18:39] MysticalOS: that basically hints he was defintely let go. cause you don't go "someone will have to drag me out" to "i left on my own accord"
[1:18:47] databob1: christ this sucks
[1:18:50] MysticalOS: that's more hinting toward being asked to resign
[1:18:51] MrEvilRex: isn't just conjecture at this point?
[1:18:51] NIICKLAS_TV: i see that the community managers dont know yet either
[1:19:03] IAmScarlett__: @Jelky55 why would they lay off someone that just came back
[1:19:15] LaMu2560: It could be that he saw 1900 of his colleagues being fired and didn't want to be part of it
[1:19:25] Smurflord: Varya posted
[1:19:28] michaelmm: Or maybe there was a decision that Ybarra didn't agree with.
[1:19:29] RAF_Sean: Twitter
[1:19:31] lyreilla: My guess is he didn't agree with the direction they wanted to go.
[1:19:32] NeeK_23: CM tweets
[1:19:36] NIICKLAS_TV: https://twitter.com/lavendervarya/status/1750528984272822509
[1:19:36] MediumRareOG: It could be anything. Maybe he didn't like hte strategy and left, maybe Microsoft wanted their own person in the role, who knows
[1:19:45] NIICKLAS_TV: https://twitter.com/Lugia_Blizz/status/1750524759132229722
[1:19:49] MysticalOS: a few employees have betweeted, no one knows who yet
[1:19:49] RAF_Sean: Some blizz employees are tweeting that they don‚Äôt know yet
[1:19:55] MrEvilRex: @NIICKLAS_TV I mean, in most companies, the community managers are sometimes the last to know certain news
[1:20:03] lyreilla: That's so sad üò≠
[1:20:33] databob1: I wonder how many of those layoffs are people that couldn't get back into the office cause they lived to far away since they were hiring everywhere durring covid
[1:20:35] MediumRareOG: It might've leaked
[1:20:47] Smurflord: If they told the employees first, then it would leak before the official announcment. There's no good way to do this.
[1:21:17] MysticalOS: it's about insider traiding. they have to do PR release first, otherwise it can be market manipulated by insiders
[1:21:23] royos__: tell employees first it leaks .. broader publish allows to control media
[1:21:32] Smurflord: I wonder how many of these layoffs are Blizzard. I mean MS has MANY studios under it's wing at this point.
[1:21:33] MysticalOS: IE if they told employees first, they could sell all their shares before it goes public
[1:21:39] michaelmm: There's not perfect way to do this but that's not an excuse to allow your staff to find out via Twitter or a Twitch stream.
[1:21:41] MrEvilRex: @databob1 a part of the reason the employees were supporting the Microsoft purchase, was because they had a better work from home policy than Blizz
[1:21:47] MediumRareOG: it means the layoffs will happen today though
[1:21:50] Pandachoww: ugh man, such a shit situation though
[1:22:01] Larkaro: Bellular said that the survival game was in dev hell
[1:22:13] Smurflord: yeah I would expect at lot at Zenimax after the Starfield fiasco.
[1:22:23] MysticalOS: @databob1 that's probably still true. MS will still be better overall long term, for the ones that are left.
[1:22:44] NeeK_23: was it 2019 when it was announced?

[1:22:49] S3N71: @Smurflord What happened to Starfield?
[1:23:08] RAF_Sean: Feels scummy wanting people on the Blizz/Warcrsft team to be impacted the least because it means I‚Äôm hoping others lose their jobs. Bad feels all around

[1:23:23] MrEvilRex: isn't this just a continuation of the firings (in tech and gaming) that has been happening since last year?
[1:23:26] Nimajin: Can't wait for all the account wide stuff coming with War within
[1:23:50] ChaosEternal: @MrEvilRex Yup. Part of the industry-wide trend.
[1:23:55] michaelmm: The job losses aren't down to us. It's OK for us as consumers to want to know how the products we've invested in are affected.
[1:23:57] MrEvilRex: the easiest way is "you are the weakest link, goodbye"
[1:24:00] Hotstitute: it would be worse if you got pulled off wow to make this unannounced survival game and got caught up in the mass fire because of it
[1:24:05] MysticalOS: you know them more personally. I don't know anyone working on diablo, half my bnet is wow developers
[1:24:07] Smurflord: Hate to say it, but someimes you have the trim the fat at bloated organisations, but it's still awful for the individual. Many projects just don't work out, and the roles are simply not there any more.
[1:24:08] funviking99: what is happening?
[1:24:13] michaelmm: We can still feel bad for the staff but also worry about the game.
[1:24:28] NeeK_23: losing a job is aways bad but a HR person can work in any industry, a Dev is very specific and is limited and the wider industry is rough at the moment
[1:24:31] funviking99: wtf
[1:24:44] MrEvilRex: what % of the number of staff is 1900?
[1:25:07] OrdinaryOlly: You have to suspect most of the layoffs will be in the areas Microsoft already cover after buying Blizz. HR, IT ext
[1:25:13] Hotstitute: so its 8.8%?
[1:25:13] IAmScarlett__: 8-10%
[1:25:18] NeeK_23: report said 8%
[1:25:19] Smurflord: 1900 is across the whole MS gaming secor, NOT Blizzard alone. Just to be clear.
[1:25:19] RAF_Sean: 8% according to the press release
[1:25:21] wildwittra: it said 8% in the article
[1:25:35] MediumRareOG: Oh it says the 1900 is "primarily at Activision-Blizzard"

[1:25:41] MrEvilRex: @MrGM the cost of living crisis is worse in Europe, it's very little/non existant in the US in comparison
[1:25:45] Matrixovershock: still a crap show that sucks
[1:26:11] MediumRareOG: @MrEvilRex You're crazy. There is an absolute cost of living crisis in the US
[1:26:22] shadowrake2000: shadowrake2000 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:26:23] Smurflord: "cost of living crisis" is largely UK, thanks to Brexit, but that's another story
[1:26:35] MediumRareOG: Bobby Kotick probably got a $500 million golden parachute for being sacked
[1:26:38] JakeSezz: Or they had to layoff to be able to pay that golden parachute mrgmO tneTaliCry
[1:27:11] IAmScarlett__: are companies usually fine after lay offs?
[1:27:12] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:27:17] Layliah79: plus unemployment?
[1:27:20] michaelmm: Riots package was unprecedented.
[1:27:23] MrEvilRex: @MediumRareOG not for the same reason as europe. US is due to corruption and corporate greed jacking up prices. In europe it's that plus the lack of cheap russian gas which impacts everything
[1:27:34] bwoods79: I wonder how well those employees that blizz acquired from that one company a year or so ago are doing
[1:27:44] RAF_Sean: 6 months doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot if there‚Äôs no jobs to go to after the lay iffs
[1:28:07] michaelmm: The norm for big companies in the US is 3 months which health benefits ending at the end of the month (1 week from now).
[1:28:08] JakeSezz: Verizon went through an RIF that was volunteer based in 2018 and people had 6 months of insurance along with a severance
[1:28:44] RAF_Sean: Oh shit yeah I hadn‚Äôt considered that, your medical care is tied to your employment in the USA
[1:28:54] MrEvilRex: @MrGM In the US the cost of living is because companies took the opportunity to jack up prices, Europe it's jacking up of prices + lack of cheap Russian energy, in the UK it's also berxit
[1:29:06] michaelmm: Epic's layoffs resulted in ppl getting 3 days notice of losing their medical care.
[1:29:12] Smurflord: Back end teams always get culled as part of an aquisition. Been through it on both sides. It's sad but inevitable, as there's so much duplication of roles.
[1:29:19] MediumRareOG: While these severance packages may seem generous, the company is just paying not to get sued. To get the package you need to agree not to sue
[1:29:26] bwoods79: I like how our company works. If you get caught in a "reduction in force", your profile get flags as such and if you apply for another position internally you get priority
[1:29:49] MrEvilRex: I agree that everyone is struggling but it's just to varying degrees
[1:29:55] michaelmm: California is an "at will" company - they cannot be sued for letting people go.
[1:30:03] michaelmm: "at will" state that is.
[1:30:14] Synckery: alot of UK companies work on short term contracts now days
[1:30:17] ChaosEternal: Unless it was for illegal reasons ofc
[1:30:19] MediumRareOG: @michaelmm Please stop repeating this. It's nonsense
[1:30:31] MrEvilRex: Contractors in the UK usually get paid a lot more than perm, in my field they get payed 2x or 3x
[1:31:26] MrEvilRex: the US just has terrible employee protections, in comparison to Europe
[1:31:31] Synckery: ye thats the flip side of it
[1:31:38] RAF_Sean: With todays‚Äô Activision-Blizzard/Microsoft layoffs added, in just 25 days of 2024 we‚Äôre already at over HALFWAY to the total layoffs of ALL OF 2023 (5,600 versus 10,500) - from Rami Ismail tweet
[1:31:46] Zucchey: @MrEvilRex We'll yes, same in mine. That's usually because the company doesn't have to pay their taxes for anything
[1:31:54] NeeK_23: French law prevented it
[1:32:19] Smurflord: French employment law is very protective.
[1:32:35] MrEvilRex: @MrGM yh why become a perm when you can just get a year's salary in 3 months, tax free expense everything you can and take more home than perm...
[1:32:36] Synckery: usually in UK law the amount of notice depends on length of service etc
[1:32:37] BusterDonuts: did you happen to see any of the barny64 scarab lord story? watching through it right now it's pretty funny / good
[1:32:38] Razashu: is it the eu part of blizzard thats impacted or soley the usa part ?
[1:32:45] bronald92: bronald92 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:32:51] michaelmm: In the UK and Ireland there will need to be 30-90 days consultation  depending on the number of losses. They have very similar rules.
[1:32:54] Smurflord: UK is pretty strong on behalf of the individual, but France is stronger. Both are light years ahead of the US.
[1:33:03] MrEvilRex: @Zucchey it's the dream, unfortunately I cannot get a contract role
[1:33:07] ChaosEternal: Fun fact, the reason employment-based healthcare is so common in the US is because the government instituted wage and price controls during WW2. This led to auxiliary benefits such as health insurance becoming far more common.
[1:33:15] MrEvilRex: @Smurflord most of Europe is
[1:33:22] RAF_Sean: Didn‚Äôt expect the skull and crossbones to mean this
[1:33:30] LHP64D: 101 raiders from LHP64D have joined! 
[1:33:32] BusterDonuts: BusterDonuts subscribed with Prime. 
[1:33:36] LHP64D: G'day mate
[1:33:46] Shrapnel_Sponge: Shrapnel_Sponge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 18 months pog
[1:33:49] NIICKLAS_TV: logan Pog
[1:34:03] LHP64D: Yeah, I learned mid stream
[1:34:22] Shrapnel_Sponge: sorry have I missed something?
[1:34:24] LHP64D: I was only saying like two days ago that I'm amazed Blizz hasn't been afected and then bam....
[1:34:27] LHP64D: Like, simply huge
[1:34:31] databob1: this all went down in the middle of T&Es podcast thats gotta suck for them
[1:34:31] LHP64D: (in a bad way)
[1:34:47] MrEvilRex: The other reason why it's an employment benefit is because of lobbying. The employer has more leverage aside from salary, if they control your healthcare. Which is the main reason Obamacare was slated and fought against each step of the way
[1:34:55] Shrapnel_Sponge: has there been big blizz cuts?
[1:35:05] Shrapnel_Sponge: (sorry I've just turned up)
[1:35:25] Shrapnel_Sponge: 1900? Damn!
[1:35:39] MaxamosTV: brutal
[1:35:59] GFairyGaming: I'm a little surprised they cancelled the survival game as that genre is really big now
[1:36:02] MysticalOS: here is the best part of it all https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049285/microsoft-3-trillion-dollar-market-valuation-milestone

[1:36:18] Shrapnel_Sponge: at least they waited until after Xmas, unlike Hasbro with Wizards of the Coast
[1:36:21] NeeK_23: Guess Cali people wont find out til going into the office today
[1:36:28] databob1: watch they'll be content creators mocking the laid off people by tonight at the latest
[1:36:34] MysticalOS: timing bro
[1:36:45] Shrapnel_Sponge: and yet it's a trillion dollars, SURELY they can afford to keep people on...
[1:36:45] MaxamosTV: correct me if I am wrong but when ZOS got acquired by MSFT they kept most of the ESO leadership team intact.  Wonder if that was too difficult to do with their vision for ATVI
[1:36:49] Shrapnel_Sponge: big yikes
[1:36:53] MaxamosTV: ZOS = zenimax
[1:36:58] Larkaro: Most employee are going to wake up or get into work with anxiety all day about not knowing if they still have a job
[1:37:00] NeeK_23: this is the shareholders world, and we're just struggling to live in it
[1:37:21] s7wede: People must always remember that company valuations are only important to one specific group of people. Shareholders. If they could make money in shutting it all down, they would and wouldn't think twice
[1:37:25] databob1: cause some people are just jerks
[1:37:35] MrEvilRex: I don't know what ppl keep expecting, works are tools for the rich to make money, why do you keep getting surprised at every exploitation. It would be as weird as being shocked that a wolf killed a lamb
[1:37:50] MrEvilRex: workers*
[1:38:11] jhopps12: @MrEvilRex 1900 people lost their job, man
[1:38:17] NeeK_23: lots of vocal wow haters will be memeing about this for online engagement
[1:38:18] MrEvilRex: you can, I'm just talking about the 3 trillion news
[1:38:28] Shrapnel_Sponge: @MrEvilRex You can still feel empathy for those fired due to corporate bullshit and capitalism wanting more from their workers with no support or help
[1:38:34] Valestrus: compassion is not an antonym of profit
[1:38:39] MaxamosTV: really sucks the biggest game under dev that we know about is axed, that is also shit
[1:38:59] MediumRareOG: You can both have compassion for the affected and also recognize that our entire economy is designed around exploiting working people in this way
[1:39:02] de_noite: @MrGM sorry for the question, but when u mean 100% completicion, what do u mean ?
[1:39:13] MrEvilRex: Guys I'm not saying that you should not be companionate towards ppl losing their jobs
[1:39:29] GFairyGaming: A Trillion is such a big number it's almost unfathomable for people to grasp just how big it is
[1:39:38] ImperfectDark: was just googling statistics and i found some graph that suggests blizz had just under 10k staff from 2017 to 2021 and then in 2022 it inflated to 13k.
[1:39:41] MrEvilRex: I'm saying it's not surprising that another mega corp is firing while making record profits
[1:39:43] databob1: wolves primary diet is small rodents if they're attacking something larger they are starving or crazed it's not a good compassion
[1:39:45] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS from Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[1:39:47] Thoreya: its number 1
[1:39:48] kaijoe_: Right behind Apple.
[1:39:49] Thoreya: took over apple
[1:39:51] Shrapnel_Sponge: is it a thousand million or a million million? depends if US or UK iirc
[1:39:56] S3N71: Apple musy be right up there
[1:40:01] S3N71: *must
[1:40:07] MediumRareOG: We will have our first trillionaire, probably within 20 years. Think about that
[1:40:07] Thoreya: recent stocks last month, passed apple
[1:40:14] OceaneSarai: the world is run by a lot of Gallywixes
[1:40:21] MrEvilRex: biggest market cap, is between apple and Microsoft. I think  walmart is still biggest head count
[1:40:23] GFairyGaming: Even a Billion is a pretty hard to grasp just how big it is. For example, 1 million seconds is about 11 days, 1 billion seconds is 35.5 years
[1:40:24] Elrathir: proletariat?
[1:40:52] MediumRareOG: Every billionaire is a policy failure
[1:40:54] Trebled_Mind: tech layoffs are absolutely out of hand.
[1:40:55] funviking99: what that means for the game?
[1:40:58] JakeSezz: @oceanesarai Gallywixi? ü§îüòÇ
[1:40:58] Midgens_: yeah its still really early in CA
[1:40:59] Gannan307: Wait what is going on? I missed it
[1:41:14] s7wede: TBH with this news I'm expecting massive news about 10.2.6 as a distraction later tonight
[1:41:14] Midgens_: @Gannan307 microsoft layoffs
[1:41:25] GFairyGaming: @MediumRareOG So much this
[1:41:32] Shrapnel_Sponge: im gutted Mike's left though, he was a mythic raider and doing big keys, it was nice to think someone holding the reins was someone who played just like us.
[1:41:43] MrEvilRex: @MediumRareOG it's not a policy failure, the policy of the US is to protect and enrich the strong and wealthy. it's going exactly as designed
[1:41:48] MediumRareOG: 1900 mostly from Activision is a large percentage of the Activision head count
[1:41:50] JakeSezz: It‚Äôs 0721 in LA. They‚Äôre probably just starting the drive to work.
[1:41:58] NeeK_23: any changes to the game would be longterm effects, its not like the servers will go down tomorrow.
[1:42:11] Shrapnel_Sponge: sadly now it's going to go to some corporate suit who doesn't even know what WoW is.
[1:42:29] MediumRareOG: The internal memo said "mostly from Activision-Blizzardc with some from Xbox and Zenimax"
[1:42:39] databob1: @MediumRareOG what policy it's easy to just throw that out but if you don't have specifics what good is even saying it
[1:42:41] LuiBMHunter: afternoon! - New Pee Cee?
[1:42:43] NeeK_23: I hope that those 3 are unaffected
[1:42:45] s7wede: yeah they often do that. You remember the entire old soldier range of cinematics was a response to how bad wow was being received at that stage. They understand most gamers have the attention span of lemmings

[1:43:02] MrEvilRex: or they are bringing back Chris Metzen?
[1:43:13] LuiBMHunter: Show us! Show us!
[1:43:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:43:20] MrEvilRex: no I mean as Head of Blizz

[1:43:43] royos__: through any acquisition a company restructure is inevitable.
[1:43:47] MediumRareOG: @databob1 The first step is to develop class consciousness and recognize that the government works to further enrich the wealthy and divide people on pointless culture issues
[1:44:03] NeeK_23: Im not sure Metzen wants to deal with the corporate stuff. I think he came back purely for the creative side
[1:44:54] alextheblight: it's pretty bad
[1:44:55] Larkaro: I was was at risk of loosing my job after hearing about it from twitter, i'd just call in sick
[1:45:13] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:45:16] LuiBMHunter: oops
[1:45:32] jhopps12: I found a video of an IGN interview with Ybarra last November being excited about the merger, damn that sucks now
[1:45:38] ImperfectDark: @Larkaro you don't want to take sick days before that signing that redundancy agreement, lol
[1:45:54] MrEvilRex: @MediumRareOG ppl would rather lose 10-20% of their living standard then risk losing their life. revelations are not easy. And those in power do not give it away, they just come up with a more complicated system
[1:46:12] jhopps12: I do wonder how long Ybarra knew this was coming
[1:46:14] MrEvilRex: srsly I hate auto correct
[1:46:23] AdamShwaginz: bro what a day
[1:46:33] s7wede: May I suggest the addon rematch. It makes creating teams to deal with world quest pet battles so much easier. There is even a whole website dedicated to creating teams and making scripts to automate the entire process
[1:46:40] NIICKLAS_TV: @AdamShwaginz what a day indeed
[1:47:01] NeeK_23: it does
[1:47:07] MysticalOS: rematch hasn't been as popular since people do level 1 strat
[1:47:12] s7wede: you can export your current pets and it creates all those teams for you
[1:47:19] hurlock09: howdy!  first timer here
[1:47:20] Vengeful_Hermit: You can import entire batches of rematch scripts for that.
[1:47:28] hurlock09: the team build-app is a great idea
[1:47:32] hurlock09: alright bud you?
[1:47:34] NIICKLAS_TV: @hurlock09 welcome
[1:47:37] MediumRareOG: @s7wede You need a bench of like 200 level 25 pets to make that effective
[1:47:39] hurlock09: yeah i hear lol
[1:47:58] Vengeful_Hermit: By the way tried Zygor and it seems to be great
[1:48:13] hurlock09: talking about the  MS/Blizz merger?
[1:48:19] databob1: @MediumRareOG yeah but the majority of people teat politics like team sports and if you think there will ever be enough government players ethical enough to fix this your fooling yourself
[1:48:28] s7wede: @MediumRareOG it's a good thing he is a completionist type gamer then.
[1:48:32] hurlock09: oh hell
[1:48:32] de_noite: already on wow-head
[1:48:40] Vengeful_Hermit: Need to see if there is a daily/weekly checklist option for mount farming and daily reps.
[1:48:56] bwoods79: See microsoft just became the 2nd company ever to break 3Trillion market value...crazy
[1:49:07] s7wede: @Vengeful_Hermit use simplearmory
[1:49:12] zerocool71487: hello chat
[1:49:18] NeeK_23: Simple armory creates a route for you for your unobtained mounts
[1:49:28] Valestrus: yh it does
[1:49:45] MediumRareOG: @s7wede I agree (and use it) but Dan is still resisting becoming a pet battler :) It takes a time investment
[1:49:48] adampanerabread: completely random, but I wish the transmog tab had an option to save your current barbershop customization
[1:49:49] Valestrus: was very proud when i worked out that my path  was exactly the same as theirs
[1:49:51] Valestrus: haha
[1:49:55] havoom01: seems like u start to enjoy pet battles
[1:50:10] hurlock09: does
[1:50:17] hurlock09: just discovered for myself
[1:50:20] flyingdutchw: Noelle Mazurek (Diablo 4 Dev) tweeted theyll know more later on the day who is affected exactly within Blizz
[1:50:20] Elrathir: Narcissus does that yeah
[1:50:22] hurlock09: Narcissus*
[1:50:32] hurlock09: but for drakes?  dunno
[1:50:39] NeeK_23: Nar -sis - sus
[1:50:44] cozy_cnr: !drops
[1:50:44] zerocool71487: I am drawing a huge blank of the pet I sue in pet battles
[1:50:44] StreamElements: World of Warcraft currently has TWITCH DROPS! Watch FOUR HOURS of any WoW Stream from 6pm GMT January 23rd - January 30th to obtain the Grim Campfire Toy in-game. REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH https://account.battle.net/connections
[1:50:46] hurlock09: def characters
[1:51:02] hurlock09: and you can step up/down based on GPU for frame rate
[1:51:14] bwoods79: Watching you do these old zones and the fact you rarely see another player shows there is alot blizz could do to make old zones more appealing
[1:51:18] magemaster225: anne stickney tweeted she was watching a streamer see the news and thats how she found out
[1:51:21] Midgens_: I have a friend that is doing that right now. I feel awful for them
[1:51:26] flyingdutchw: awful way to wake up and then having to go to work not knowing
[1:51:28] hurlock09: seems it can be a resource hog tho lol
[1:51:37] FezPanda: What's really shitty is these workers aren't even being told before the press releases it seems
[1:51:39] cozy_cnr: are you gonna be streaming at least 2hours?
[1:51:39] jhopps12: it's 7:30am pst, so people are waking up/going to work not knowing if they have a job
[1:52:17] cozy_cnr: thanks Kappa
[1:52:49] dright424: I am pretty sure it is normal for press releases to be sent out prior to workers being told due to layoff notice laws
[1:52:49] zerocool71487: I earned a pet for pet battles and I cannot remember then name
[1:53:19] Forgiven78: Chances are they've been notified well in advance that they have had their jobs eliminated,  The company i work for has undergone roughly 4 layoff/rifts over a 5-6 year period and we knew well in advance if our position was eliminated.
[1:53:30] michaelmm: I've seen a Bethesda CM say on twitter they are impacted.
[1:53:44] kaijoe_: No, they don't know.
[1:53:51] s7wede: It depends on your contract
[1:53:51] osmir712: Please tell me how to send my pet to attack the enemy and stay in camouflage
[1:53:54] kaijoe_: All of the devs are tweeting they don't know.
[1:53:58] FezPanda: It's like when M&S had layoffs the other year. The staff only found out when news went on twitter
[1:54:05] okologiko: Hello and sorry to bother, can I ask you please if Zygor guides you only thru quests, or if it helps you by guiding you in achievements and how to get mounts etc....?
[1:54:07] bwoods79: They just need 1% of the payout I am sure bobby k got with his leaving
[1:54:11] hurlock09: ctrl C
[1:54:18] hurlock09: oops!  ctrl 1
[1:54:32] hurlock09: is std but can rebind
[1:54:51] okologiko: Ah nice thank you:)
[1:54:53] zerocool71487: the Shadowbarb hatchling is the pet I use, when I obtained it, it just does the job. I don't pet battle often but when I do it is good to have
[1:55:00] Forgiven78: Do we have confirmation from an employee that is the case, i just find it hard to believe with a large company like Microsoft that would bring a blade down on that many employees without some sort of pre-swing.
[1:55:05] zerocool71487: I had to load my game to get the name
[1:55:16] FezPanda: Btw how was Bring me the Horizon? (apart from horrible stadium prices)
[1:55:18] isillytoy: to be honest i am surprised that the layoffs didn't happen sooner
[1:55:29] NeeK_23: Anne Stickney, lead narrative for wow doesnt know til later
[1:55:32] alextheblight: that is bleak
[1:55:33] Thoreya: gaming industry is ruthless man
[1:55:37] funviking99: seems that a lot of gaming companies did that, sad times
[1:55:56] Thoreya: i feel like it happens way more often in gaming tho
[1:56:06] s7wede: rank 4 Azerothian Archives achieved. The final stretch before freedom!
[1:56:20] Thoreya: omg lol i miss these wqs
[1:56:20] michaelmm: Wow devs are waking up and starting to  tweet - they didn't know. There was  a work email but many saw it online first - cos of how early in the day it is.
[1:56:34] s7wede: just about, I work from home so I just have it on my laptop
[1:56:43] Thoreya: I Hope Ion is safe
[1:56:45] Drakkxou: Hey mrgm, I know you like that kind of thing : its possible to use dragonriding mount with "classic flying" but you need to be a monk in order to do this (sorry for my english)
[1:56:46] Thoreya: ill be so sad
[1:56:51] Midgens_: yeah its only 7:36 AM in CA
[1:57:01] hurlock09: yeah...why wouldn't you wait until EOD?   shows no care for employees
[1:57:02] MediumRareOG: @Thoreya really? i hated the turtle WQs
[1:57:03] Smurflord: Of course it was early. They have to make those announcements before Wall St. opens for the day.
[1:57:09] demololtv: no
[1:57:16] magemaster225: wonder about holly, dunno if she would be joining in on the 10.2.6 hype if she knew about the layoffs
[1:57:20] Drakkxou: yeah the cloud thing
[1:57:20] Thoreya: @MediumRareOG better than the ish we have now
[1:57:26] ExcelsisEU: it does that at low level
[1:57:31] Midgens_: it was past 10am on the east coast when it went out
[1:57:38] Midgens_: stocks open at 9 I think
[1:57:48] UlthraneDK: Yo, this is depressing, so much hype after BlizzCon and the directions of the games was so hype.
[1:58:05] amricatt: @Midgens_ It was earlier than 10am.
[1:58:13] kaijoe_: There are Blizz devs texting Jason Schreier if he know if they've been cut. Microsoft botched this big.
[1:58:20] michaelmm: IME of redundancies in big companies, senior leaders find out a few days in advance with other people manager getting maybe 24hr notice.
[1:58:38] FezPanda: Jason does get tons of info early it seems
[1:58:42] michaelmm: It's often a closely guarded secret among the C-Suite.
[1:58:48] nuclearphosphate: !lurk
[1:59:40] Tankersss: there is an addon for that I think rematch
[1:59:41] LuiBMHunter: there's an addon for that!
[2:00:06] Vengeful_Hermit: Is there still a boat from ratchet to booty bay in retail?
[2:00:12] LuiBMHunter: just keep sending the same pet - they learn or they die!
[2:00:52] uberkudzu: Morning!
[2:01:21] NeeK_23: Nintendo probably shut it down xD
[2:01:30] FezPanda: I think it was yeah
[2:01:38] LuiBMHunter: noooo?
[2:01:39] s7wede: They are investigating yeah
[2:01:42] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[2:01:55] ImperfectDark: yeah, they must have been bombarded with complaints
[2:02:03] thunduz: dude there is so much gaming news I am trying to catch up on right now
[2:02:18] Suze_o_0: my son got palworld, b ut he said he wont play it until they have a major bug fixed done LMAO
[2:02:23] thunduz: no, it is not
[2:02:25] zerocool71487: I mean Palworld copied some art and used AI art so it won't be good I do not think
[2:02:45] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[2:02:45] thunduz: The microsoft stuff, blizzard stuff, and palworld stuff is all wild
[2:02:48] s7wede: the very fact that they announced it is only to appease the public. Nintendo is the most litigious company in the world. If there was even the slightest hint of infringement, they would have buried the game and the company that produced it already. This is just a statement to appease the twitter mob
[2:02:49] keyboardturner: no proof yet
[2:02:52] ImperfectDark: yeah, i thought someone said there was no proof of AI
[2:03:01] thunduz: I have seen nothing to prove they used AI
[2:03:02] funviking99: I hope all these people find new jobs quick, in these times you can‚Äôt be certain of anything
[2:03:09] zerocool71487: that could be
[2:03:11] Suze_o_0: apparently, there is a bug where if someone in the guild leaves, the rest of them members get an error andkicked and cant relog back in

[2:03:17] nuclearphosphate: @zerocool71487 nintendo are officially investigating palworld (rightly so) for ip infringement and copyright infringement
[2:03:21] Suze_o_0: another was people are falling through the qorld
[2:03:31] FezPanda: The dude in the past has done AI art to make pokemon and has said he wants to use it to get around copyright but there doesn't seem to be any ingame
[2:03:39] JakeSezz: Seeing some really good memes about Palworld, which is helping with the shitty gaming day that today is
[2:03:57] zerocool71487: @nuclearphosphate that's where I was going, some of the monsters are direct copies of Pokemon
[2:03:57] FezPanda: Yes LUL
[2:04:11] Gannan307: Idk from what I have seen idk if Nintendo has anything on Palworld
[2:04:19] nuclearphosphate: @zerocool71487 100% and yet people are too blind to see it (not talking about folk in here)
[2:04:19] Suze_o_0: YES
[2:04:23] Getcha_Pulll: yess
[2:04:31] S3N71: Aye, please

[2:05:05] Harai_Ulfsark: i mean palworld probably flown under nintendo's radar until it sold 2 gazillion copies or something

[2:28:55] Forgiven78: Are there screws on the back to  allow the side to remove?
[2:29:02] CygnusC: the glass panel should slide horizontally
[2:29:04] realGameTheory: AngelThump
[2:29:05] MediumRareOG: The glass should slide back (towards the back). It might be screwed in at the back
[2:29:08] handovdoom666: unscrew that
[2:29:12] LuiBMHunter: usually two thumb screws on back one top one bottom for side panel
[2:29:14] handovdoom666: I have a Starforge PC

[2:29:28] Shocklate_: turn it on Madge
[2:29:35] wastedxtime93: The reveal was done!
[2:29:40] LuiBMHunter: sledgehammer?
[2:29:43] thunduz: are we sure it's not meant to be shattered? try taking a hammer to the glass and see what happens
[2:29:46] SlithTheSivak: ok u pull the window back
[2:29:49] politimi_72: Hey dan, is that a StarPog PC ???
[2:29:50] SlithTheSivak: i just saw a video

[2:30:25] ImperfectDark: oh yeah, 2 screws at the back there to remove the top panel and then glass should slide up
[2:30:30] SlithTheSivak: u can check unboxing videos on starforge pcs...
[2:30:36] MrEvilRex: @MrGM be careful of you chair smashing the glass
[2:30:37] funviking99: I knew it‚Äôs starforge
[2:30:41] LuiBMHunter: remember TO check the PSU is set to the right POWER setting
[2:30:45] S3N71: What's the specs?
[2:30:56] handovdoom666: @ImperfectDark there's a small screw in the middle that holds the glass in
[2:30:56] SlithTheSivak: @MrGM the real question is what toy are you going to put inside of your PC case?
[2:31:00] politimi_72: @MrGM Enjoy your new pc <3
[2:31:16] smesus: user error
[2:31:20] MrEvilRex: remember to lift with you hips and knees not your back, correct form
[2:31:35] stellabellas: So exciting, new shiney things! and I have that same phone cover.  lol
[2:31:47] Reckless_Monk: 4090 lets goo
[2:31:47] nyrhalahotep: we're gonna need a bigger desk
[2:31:49] MrEvilRex: weight might be a bit much
[2:31:50] ImperfectDark: @handovdoom666 ah ok, might be a different version than mine!
[2:31:52] politimi_72: Pog Pog Pog Pog Pog
[2:31:57] RAF_Sean: Did he say which model they sent?
[2:32:09] S3N71: Not yet
[2:32:16] Zucchey: What are the specs
[2:32:22] Pumba2988: at least the power button aint on the top
[2:32:25] Reckless_Monk: Lian Li cased
[2:32:37] smesus: yes, please put it away before the desk colapses
[2:32:44] thunduz: I really liked Lian Li
[2:32:50] politimi_72: is it the voyager creator pro?
[2:32:51] Forgiven78: !Starforge
[2:32:52] Shocklate_: Gotta start hitting the gym MrGM
[2:32:55] handovdoom666: @mrgm, remove the top panel, then there's a small screw that holds the glass. you need to remove that then you can pull the glass out.
[2:33:05] Zucchey: i9-14900K, 4080, not bad
[2:33:21] SlithTheSivak: sick specs
[2:33:40] LuiBMHunter: twin 2TB nvme - cooo
[2:33:49] hurlock09: YES!
[2:33:50] hurlock09: pls
[2:33:53] MrEvilRex: 14900k is not that much of an upgrade form 13900k
[2:34:02] politimi_72: @MrGM will you boot it up on stream for the first time??? Pog
[2:34:07] Forgiven78: !STARFORGE Systems
[2:34:10] realGameTheory: Pog
[2:34:11] nuclearphosphate: @Zucchey thats what ive got though its a RTX 4090 ive got
[2:34:14] MysticalOS: they ddin't even send you creator PC
[2:34:25] SlithTheSivak: you should top your setup off with a G9 monitor
[2:34:31] MrEvilRex: does it mention the case anywhere?
[2:34:31] MysticalOS: well, the top of line one
[2:35:11] Shocklate_: HUGE
[2:35:20] politimi_72: Is it sponsored? Congratz! a big one there!!!
[2:35:29] Shocklate_: Yea but can it run WoW?
[2:35:31] MrEvilRex: ew windows 11
[2:35:34] MysticalOS: still not best spec, i'd say 32G ram a little low for a creator PC, but can expand it yourself
[2:35:34] SlithTheSivak: wrapped cables are nice
[2:35:50] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex nothing wrong AT ALL with windows 11 dude
[2:35:51] MysticalOS: windows 11 is fine, an dis required for any CPU with P and E cores
[2:35:56] thunduz: looks really solid. they gifted big time
[2:36:11] politimi_72: to all haters, win 11 are FINE!!
[2:36:15] MrEvilRex: 3.7K and they only gave you a gold rated PSU? Scammed
[2:36:17] ghuuny: have u seen the wowhead article about layoffs and survival game cancellation?
[2:36:17] nuclearphosphate: wait, that was a GIFT??!!
[2:36:22] nuclearphosphate: @politimi_72 ^ this
[2:36:23] LuiBMHunter: fairly sure your daughter will cost more
[2:36:30] Pumba2988: Asmongold PC company
[2:36:32] hurlock09: it's NICE!
[2:36:33] Gannan307: @politimi_72 It's fine, but I wish I could go back to 10 lol
[2:36:37] SlithTheSivak: u could knock maybe 1500 off the price if u built it urself

[2:37:24] MrEvilRex: @nuclearphosphate plenty wrong with it, Co-pilot shoved everywhere, more spying  and as always "newer and shiner, but less features than older Windows"
[2:37:29] politimi_72: @MrGM did that arrive from their EU hub ?
[2:37:48] chelfx: @MrEvilRex i use win 11 never seen anythin about Co-pilot
[2:37:52] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex its only "shoved everywhere" if you leave it installed, i disabled it internally as soon as it was installed
[2:38:03] JakeSezz: Do you get any kickbacks via a code or URL?
[2:38:07] politimi_72: because US import fees are way too high lol

[2:40:11] politimi_72: alexa be like : Do it your self xD
[2:40:19] Reckless_Monk: Man.. I kinda want to cancel my preorder of The War Within.. Losing that many people in thei games division.. is brutal. Patch cadence is gonna slow down..
[2:40:21] JakeSezz: Just out of curiosity will you be able to add it as part of your YouTube video & profile links?
[2:40:24] MrEvilRex: @chelfx you can read tech news, you'd see that Microsoft is pushing co-pilot into paint, office and even the start menu button is being replaced with co pilot icon
[2:40:36] MrEvilRex: "look at this graph"
[2:40:47] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex ive still disabled and uninstalled it, it aint comin back
[2:40:49] MediumRareOG: Dan, the side glass panel is probably screwed in for shipment. There should be one screw at the top. You can probably leave it off
[2:40:55] chelfx: @MrEvilRex ok thank you :D
[2:41:07] JakeSezz: Hell yeah! Maximize that potential
[2:41:17] Dokeefe1986: Hi sup
[2:41:24] thunduz: LOL
[2:41:29] MrEvilRex: @chelfx hopefully it didn't come across as being an a hole. I meant to be helpful
[2:41:39] Melithian: LUL Tali
[2:41:47] chelfx: @MrEvilRex ill be looking forward to it
[2:41:51] Harai_Ulfsark: what did i miss
[2:41:53] thunduz: The good feeling was the pc unboxing right?
[2:41:58] MrEvilRex: @nuclearphosphate fair enough, I've experienced Microsoft reset my settings with updates
[2:42:28] MediumRareOG: I think the side panel is magnetic so should stay in place. It just has an extra screw they use for shipment so it doesn't come off
[2:42:30] LuiBMHunter: plans for the old pee cee?
[2:42:37] tarnishedvalor: what rep are you working on?

[2:42:47] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex thats why im VERY careful about *what* updates im installing now, i only do the security ones and the full on next major ones
[2:42:48] wastedxtime93: Maybe thats what skull and bones was a reference to all this time. RIP Pirate patch.
[2:42:50] MrEvilRex: are we doing anymore dragon races?
[2:42:56] hurlock09: what do you currently use (PC)?
[2:43:04] chelfx: i think they wont do anything news kinda bad PR

[2:43:51] jhopps12: I kinda hope there's no WoW news today
[2:43:57] hurlock09: absolutely didn't know that
[2:44:04] chelfx: so Josh Greenfield the lead on classic still doesnt know if his wife lost her job
[2:44:11] NeeK_23: CM for Fallout seems to have gone
[2:44:13] michaelmm: ABK had a bit of form for tyring to bury bad news behind game annoucements.  Who knows what MS are like on that front.
[2:44:32] chelfx: Bethesda
[2:44:34] SZebra: Yep, Bethesda
[2:44:36] NeeK_23: Bethesda is MS
[2:44:37] Travnar: wouldnt be surprised if news was intentionally released today to divert attention some.
[2:44:47] politimi_72: the first fallot was made by black isle
[2:44:59] michaelmm: Jason Scheier tweeted that Staff have DM'd him to see if he knows anything about things,
[2:45:10] MrEvilRex: have we confirmed if it was MSFT or ABK choice to fire the peeps?
[2:45:33] Shocklate_: KEKW
[2:45:52] michaelmm: The size of the losses are down to MS - likely ABK will have to decide how to allocate them.
[2:46:00] Shocklate_: no KEKW
[2:46:07] Shocklate_: I think people are just memeing on you
[2:46:09] NeeK_23: no, dont be silly
[2:46:12] Elrathir: wasn't your fault ofc
[2:46:21] Nice_n_Dicey: well, that is seriosuly unfortunate....

[2:46:52] volkreig: hey Dan and chat just sending my thoughts to you all in this sad time
[2:46:53] michaelmm: Maybe Holly tweeting was because she knew that the wow team isn't being impacted. Hopium I know but I'll grasp any straw.
[2:47:22] RAF_Sean: Way to go Dan, way to go
[2:47:29] michaelmm: yeah that tweet didn't age well.
[2:47:30] chelfx: yes you killed it fast
[2:47:44] Molskis: Echooooo
[2:47:50] chelfx: you need to let the elevator to trigger to go down
[2:47:57] Eggz1004: just get teleported out and then run back in and you should be fine
[2:47:59] thunduz: like neek said the humor is helpful in those moments. humor is great especially when irony is involved lol
[2:48:03] MrEvilRex: no echo for me
[2:48:12] MrEvilRex: I finished the drop
[2:48:27] JakeSezz: And the terminally online certainly don‚Äôt have a sense of humor
[2:48:34] thunduz: you're just too good
[2:49:09] Eggz1004: epic gamer
[2:49:11] MrEvilRex: @JakeSezz that was so not funny, I'm always online and have a sense of humour :P #sarcasm
[2:49:15] nuclearphosphate: oh f**k off... ive got covid again, HOW i have it i dont know ive not been out anywhere in ages
[2:49:20] volkreig: it‚Äôs the shock
[2:49:23] volkreig: I think
[2:49:30] JakeSezz: @mrevilrex mrgmHehe saltyb27Cheers
[2:49:41] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: :( @nuclearphosphate
[2:49:44] MrEvilRex: @nuclearphosphate I thought we were done with covid?
[2:49:53] thunduz: it's a valid feeling. I would be in the same mindset.
[2:49:55] MrEvilRex: @nuclearphosphate also, get well soon
[2:49:57] nuclearphosphate: yeah just did a lateral flow as im feeling REALLY tired and came up positive, dunno how ive got it again.... ive not been anywhere in ages
[2:50:02] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex nope, its still around
[2:50:17] Nice_n_Dicey: it isnt your fault, but this is the internet, so people will troll anyway
[2:50:22] Eggz1004: nope, you can kill her before she phases and you can still get through
[2:50:24] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex deffo still around, as someone who volunteers in hospital setting
[2:50:25] SZebra: Might just want to reply to your tweet with "Shit!"
[2:50:37] nuclearphosphate: @nuclearphosphate but hasnt volunteered in hospital setting since before september last year
[2:50:49] nuclearphosphate: @Elkhuntsman not sure if kidding or....
[2:50:58] MrEvilRex: @nuclearphosphate oh, I was treating it as no longer existent tbh
[2:50:59] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It's surged again despite the vaccines alerts.  Not everyone has gotten this year's.
[2:51:09] Kaaluu1: it‚Äôs still only 10am California. the individuals may still be getting or waiting to get notice. I imagine blizz will say something after those notices go out.
[2:51:22] MrEvilRex: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm is it because it's winter?
[2:51:32] CerebrillUK: hard to say, when i got laid off my dept director had no idea
[2:51:35] Kaaluu1: I don‚Äôt think they can say anything before the notices
[2:51:44] chelfx: so last year 10500 people were laid off in 2023 in video game sector and in 2024 we are already at 5500 layoffs
[2:51:51] JakeSezz: I mean‚Ä¶is it possible she may not have? I would imagine she wouldn‚Äôt have been, what is now seen, so blaise
[2:51:59] SZebra: She'd probably know, but she also doesn't seem like the sort of person to tweet that meme ahead of a layoff.
[2:52:02] nuclearphosphate: @MrEvilRex ah, nope, deffo does still exist, im seeing more and more people get it as well, so theres another varient at least possibly doing the rounds (JN-1 - doing the rounds from china currently)
[2:52:14] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Possibly, or might be people have "Forgotten" how to protect themselves and others.  FOlks are tired of it.
[2:52:15] michaelmm: As a people manager who when through this my director and his boss (a VP) all found out the same time I did.
[2:52:46] kpatt17: That is really surprising to hear that they don't hear before notices. The company I work for went through layoffs during December. They didn't issue a public notice till Jan.
[2:52:52] MrEvilRex: @nuclearphosphate ty for the info
[2:53:28] LuiBMHunter: dunno if there's any rules in the US
[2:53:30] kpatt17: That's a good question. I have no idea. I also don't work in tech/ entertainment so it could be a very different world.
[2:53:32] Smurflord: It depends if they are a publicly traded company or not. If they're listed on the stockmarket, they have to make a statement.
[2:53:33] thunduz: I think I saw Anne Stikney said an email went out like way early in the morning like before she even was able to finish breakfast
[2:53:41] NeeK_23: i whisperd @Shocklate_ with a link
[2:53:52] MrEvilRex: @kpatt17 depends on the company size, how public facing they are, US or or European employment laws and NDAs
[2:53:53] chelfx: Layoffs where all of Microsoft Blizzard Bethesda not just Blizzard
[2:53:56] Shocklate_: https://twitter.com/LadyDevann/status/1750532326172528770
[2:54:04] Shocklate_: I'm a bad mod
[2:54:17] MrEvilRex: what's a CM the only CM I know is centimetre
[2:54:33] NeeK_23: community manager

[2:55:26] MrEvilRex: EU team was gutted in 23 early 23 I believe, it was blizz france
[2:55:28] LuiBMHunter: I found it impossible - but I'm not very skilled
[2:55:59] chelfx: I think most the people that will be affected in blizz are the people who were working on the survival game
[2:56:00] MrEvilRex: lemme double check and get back to u
[2:56:12] NeeK_23: 2nd to last MCs you on pull
[2:56:13] LuiBMHunter: impossible to solo - you need a duo or more
[2:56:18] MrEvilRex: sorry it was 2019
[2:56:18] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:56:39] MrEvilRex: but as we all know everything after 2019 is just a blur and the same year
[2:56:47] chelfx: Well it's not just Blizzard getting layoffs
[2:56:55] Aerisot: 1900 across the entire company, not just Blizzard
[2:56:57] picollee_: It is possible to solo, but its VERY hard
[2:56:57] michaelmm: The 1900 is accross all of ABK and Zenimax tho.
[2:57:15] michaelmm: Hard to say how many Blizzard folks are impacted.
[2:57:21] SlithTheSivak: makes me sad
[2:57:49] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: What is ABK? I know it's Activision but not sure what the other BK means.
[2:58:11] MrEvilRex: king is mobile games
[2:58:21] chelfx: Yes
[2:58:35] chelfx: King isn't officially apart the name
[2:58:39] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Did Rumble take off like they hoped?
[2:58:40] IAmScarlett__: im still kinda excited for the worldsoul sage
[2:58:47] michaelmm: King was part of Activision Blizzard, ABK is kinda their internal codename for Activision Blizzard.
[2:58:49] MrEvilRex: they kept stating that the reason for the purchase is king's mobile knowledge so I would understand why they would be untouched
[2:58:51] NeeK_23: didnt King make up 70% of ABK revenue last year and several years similar numbers
[2:59:05] jhopps12: @michaelmm the K does stand for King
[2:59:31] Solastro: Even less chance of getting actual PVP focused dev support and communication
[2:59:32] michaelmm: On the stock market they were ATVI oddly enought.
[2:59:32] jhopps12: @michaelmm oh rip, I misread your message lol. my b
[3:00:03] Reckless_Monk: OOOOF
[3:00:10] MrEvilRex: another reason to unionise in the US
[3:00:28] Dokeefe1986: The stock ticker isn't abk. It's atvi
[3:00:45] Nice_n_Dicey: true
[3:01:07] SlithTheSivak: its microsoft stock now
[3:01:11] Shocklate_: meh fuck em, anyone that actually thinks you had any ill intent behind your tweet are room temperature IQ at best and their opinions dont matter
[3:01:12] michaelmm: ATVI stock was abolished with the takeover.
[3:01:15] SlithTheSivak: abk hasnt traded since october of last year
[3:01:19] Dokeefe1986: Right, I meant was
[3:01:36] LuiBMHunter: isn't it' just MS now?
[3:01:38] michaelmm: It doesn't exist any more.
[3:01:39] SlithTheSivak: Its all Microsoft stock now, they bought it for 95/share
[3:01:46] dragondognein: It was bought by MSFT
[3:02:05] Smurflord: Yep, I made a nice stack on my AVTI stock when the sale happened :D
[3:02:10] Akela3: stock will go up. investors love cost cutting
[3:02:13] SlithTheSivak: Activision closed trading at 91 back in October...Microsoft paid a premium of 95/share
[3:02:30] michaelmm: Annoucements of layoffs pretty much always trigger increases in stock prices.

[3:03:14] Smurflord: @SlithTheSivak Yeah but it was about $100 before the sex/abuse scandals
[3:03:31] Smurflord: About 20% return on investment, which is great.
[3:03:40] dragondognein: stock is the ownership of the company, when another copy buys the company they buy up all the stock.
[3:03:59] michaelmm: On a buyout the acquirer buys 100% of the shares for whatever price they offered from them and the shares get disbanded.
[3:04:08] Smurflord: yeah the stock was liquidated and I was sent the funds. I didn't get MSFT stock.
[3:04:20] MediumRareOG: Buyouts can be for cash, stock in the buying company or a combination of the two
[3:04:22] MrEvilRex: not necessarily all just 51% if they are keeping the shares untouched
[3:04:25] chintzypop: will warbands make collecting transmogs much faster?
[3:04:29] michaelmm: Shareholders get sometimes cash, sometimes shares in the aqquirer, often a combination of both.
[3:04:30] SlithTheSivak: yep, then Ybarra came in, price got driven down further until aquisition. Was able to knock 5 billion off of Microsoft initial offer. Ybarra coming in and selling to Microsoft was always the plan
[3:04:33] Smurflord: I mean I DO have MSFT stock, but that's separate :)
[3:04:49] MrEvilRex: I use to work for an asset management firm so I know a bit
[3:05:08] michaelmm: I used to work for a investment funds manager. We'd have to deal with 2-3 mergers every month.
[3:05:13] SlithTheSivak: Ybarra became President of Blizzard right after 20 years at Microsoft
[3:05:42] Dokeefe1986: Ya ybarra was a plant lol
[3:05:43] NeeK_23: this one is fine, its the next
[3:06:02] IAmScarlett__: it seems like mike was ousted out of his position
[3:06:04] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I came in late; which dungeon? It don't rec it.
[3:06:10] MrEvilRex: if you had a pet, and you get mind controlled, does your pet also get mind controlled?
[3:06:11] SlithTheSivak: served for two years, drove the price down, negotiated a discount on the company purchase. He was instrumental in the sale.
[3:06:14] Shocklate_: this boss will kill you
[3:06:18] ImperfectDark: yeah, i vaguely remember not being able to get past this one
[3:06:25] IAmScarlett__: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm this is uldir, the first raid of bfa
[3:06:33] Shocklate_: you gotta 2 man it
[3:06:35] smesus: so close
[3:06:42] Smurflord: I'm sad Ybarra is gone, he did more for community engagement that any of the old-school Blizz guys ever did.
[3:06:43] MrEvilRex: you killed it though?
[3:06:48] Kalakimatra: you got it
[3:06:54] ExoduzOG: can help
[3:07:06] Sammonia: Sammonia subscribed with Prime. 
[3:07:08] volkreig: Lover just watching Ybarra streaming keys he seemed quite down to earth
[3:07:11] NeeK_23: sure 2 sec
[3:07:13] volkreig: loved*
[3:07:18] SicariusGTV: i can come
[3:07:28] Sammonia: Good. Always like to support my fellow Collection homies. It's a tough life out here.
[3:07:31] ExoduzOG: Exoduz-Stormscale
[3:07:40] SicariusGTV: Sicarius-TarrenMill
[3:08:00] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: What mounts come from here (Battlenet but not WoW open)
[3:08:12] ImperfectDark: the mail set from here is nice
[3:08:15] Harai_Ulfsark: NA :(
[3:08:20] NeeK_23: i'll come evoker, maybe its also cheesable with zephyr
[3:08:24] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: That indeed is a cool gun.
[3:08:28] SlithTheSivak: Dream scenario is Mike Morhaime becomes President of Blizzard again. I want Metzen to stay creative on WoW
[3:08:30] chelfx: The gear looks cool too
[3:08:34] MrEvilRex: what graphics card do you have currently?
[3:08:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: So we have Uldar, Uldim, and Uldir?
[3:08:46] ImperfectDark: mythic version
[3:09:05] kpatt17: What CPU?
[3:09:09] NeeK_23: Uldaz (Tyrhold)
[3:09:16] MrEvilRex: should be enough to run wow on max then. unless you are also using to stream encode
[3:09:30] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I like that set!
[3:09:43] NeeK_23: hell yeah
[3:09:45] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS from Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[3:09:53] MrEvilRex: so use this pc as the streaming pc and your new pc as the gaming pc
[3:09:55] MediumRareOG: Uldum, Ulduar, Uldir, Uldaz, Uldaman
[3:10:01] NeeK_23: I have underrot portal
[3:10:16] Lausten: @MrEvilRex If power was free sure LUL
[3:10:18] SlithTheSivak: wait, British slang has their own word for Otaku? TIL Neeks are a thing
[3:10:25] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: WHO came up with these names????
[3:10:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Not confusing, nah
[3:11:00] NeeK_23: it sells but takes so long.
[3:11:06] kpatt17: Did you sell a t-mog you could collect?
[3:11:06] MrEvilRex: @Lausten it's his job... it gets expensed and he can always choose not to do it. he cannot if he gifts the pc away
[3:11:28] MediumRareOG: Uldir always sounded like "Oh dear" to me, like it was a mistake
[3:12:04] volkreig: who is the pc sponsor?
[3:12:06] ImperfectDark: @MediumRareOG i heard it as "ol dear" like someone describing an old lady
[3:12:12] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I actually don't know the names, but I know one is in the EK, two in NR (I like the Viking one because I used to get materials there from the humanoids and make bags to sell way, way back) and one in Tanaris.
[3:12:19] SlithTheSivak: waking up to the realization everyone knew before they did that they lost their jobs
[3:12:34] S3N71: !starforge
[3:12:34] StreamElements: BEST PCs IN THE UNIVERSE https://starforgepc.com/MrGM
[3:12:38] MrEvilRex: waking up at 4:50pm a bit late for a work day but hey...
[3:12:43] fooxytv: congrats on the new sponsor!
[3:12:45] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:12:48] databob1: Are they ok or is it a meltdown
[3:13:02] SlithTheSivak: its 8am pst, the news broke at 5:30am...most people were asleep
[3:13:03] MrEvilRex: I know they are in the Us it was a joke
[3:13:04] MisterHooyah: where is the 10.2.6, war within alpha news :(
[3:13:18] chelfx: Still 9am in Cali kinda late to be just waking up
[3:13:19] MachoCham: Greg Street put a good post up as to why they publicly announce before telling them
[3:13:33] amricatt: I thought the news was gonna be tomorrow
[3:13:39] keyboardturner: i kind of hope we don't get news today because it'll feel like a total PR move distraction

[3:13:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Well, not waking up, but being at their computers.
[3:13:52] MachoCham: https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1750551418463748588
[3:13:57] SlithTheSivak: could u imagine waking up to a press release ur fired
[3:14:05] amricatt: Didn't the blue post weekly thingie say something for news on the 26 or am I making that up.
[3:14:21] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Hopefully they get severance pay.
[3:14:44] amricatt: Ah.  I clearly don't pay enough attention.
[3:15:02] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Kid's in college for game design and programming.  I've mentioned the competiveness of the field, but am trying also to support her.
[3:15:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:16:13] NeeK_23: reenter
[3:16:16] MachoCham: Everyone is also assuming it's the dev team that have been gutted. Likelihood is that a lot of the posts are more administrative (HR, Marketing, Accounts etc) A company doesn't need two departments
[3:16:23] Getcha_Pulll: lmao
[3:16:25] smesus: LUL
[3:17:02] MachoCham: It still sucks, don't get me wrong
[3:17:27] MachoCham: Have you ever seen the film Teeth monkaS
[3:17:55] michaelmm: Folks on Raven Software (one of the COD studios) are being impacted.
[3:18:11] michaelmm: ^Tweeting that is
[3:18:41] Lausten: So only 10 new cods a year now
[3:19:47] MachoCham: Someone made a good point I saw as well, if any of those people are told before hand they are being laid off there could be an impact of potential insider trading
[3:20:27] Harai_Ulfsark: dont you need to do both sides at the same time?
[3:20:44] MachoCham: I think this is probably my least favourite opening raid of an expansion
[3:21:13] MachoCham: As in, as alliance it was just a random raid
[3:21:15] Redivna: I think every raid should get one final rework to make it soloable
[3:21:24] MrEvilRex: dew it
[3:21:47] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I hope.  There's a lot of BFA and SL I can't solo.
[3:21:55] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: And I don't do PUGs well.
[3:22:44] MediumRareOG: I believe all BFA Mythic dungeons can be soloed now. Raids not so

[3:22:59] MrEvilRex: why are you guys bullying Jabbas lil bro?
[3:23:12] MachoCham: BFA should have been legacy mode-d already
[3:23:13] nuclearphosphate: @Redivna i seriously hope all BfA stuff will be soloable in TWW
[3:23:15] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies üß° https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[3:23:25] nuclearphosphate: @MachoCham 100%
[3:23:27] MachoCham: I suspect it wasn't due to the level rework in SL
[3:23:45] MachoCham: Under the old rules, TWW would give us SL legacy mode
[3:24:15] databob1: what's this there were no old gods in BFA
[3:24:36] nuclearphosphate: @MachoCham lets face it, that aint gonna happen lol
[3:24:49] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: There were old gods? I know Anduin was affected by the big-boss.
[3:25:48] MachoCham: Legacy loot, just not legacy buff to make old content soloable
[3:25:51] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I rather liked that cutscene.  Hello Wrathion.  SMACK!
[3:25:53] maplelost: is the 10.2.6 pirate flag content patch the firing of 1900 employees
[3:26:28] MachoCham: I gave in and bought Palworld on Steam
[3:26:53] Redivna: nice, I hope you enjoy it @machocham !
[3:27:27] MachoCham: I played the free version on Gamepass! Really enjoyed it so wanted to buy the Steam version for the Steamdeck and to pay it back to support the development
[3:28:23] MachoCham: Yeah the Steam version is more up to date
[3:28:25] MachoCham: And only ¬£20
[3:28:28] RAF_Sean: Any Warcraft CMs hit yet?
[3:28:30] michaelmm: Yeah customer services and community always seem to be hit first.
[3:29:08] MrEvilRex: which shop?
[3:29:09] Garrand52: wait they are laying off people :(
[3:29:12] MachoCham: I'll bring the deck down anyway you can have a whirl
[3:29:14] michaelmm: We wow CM team got cut to the bone back in 2018's ActiBlizz layoffs.
[3:29:19] RAF_Sean: That little overlay widget in the top left, is that easy to make?
[3:29:26] MrEvilRex: @Garrand52 1.9K
[3:29:31] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Very nice, very nice indeed.
[3:29:35] MachoCham: Football Sam?
[3:29:46] MachoCham: Or am I getting people mixed up
[3:29:49] MachoCham: Legend
[3:30:11] MrEvilRex: never understood ppl just sitting in their underwear, like do you know get cold?
[3:30:34] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Heaters.
[3:30:39] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Or electric blankets?
[3:30:40] MachoCham: Sometimes you just got to air it out

[3:31:05] MrEvilRex: even with heating on, I've had underfloor heating and radiators, still would get a cold if I just sat in my underwear
[3:31:14] S3N71: I got heated grips on my VMAX (motorbike)
[3:31:19] chelfx: nah dont you didnt know
[3:31:20] fooxytv: I think you're worrying about it too much
[3:31:22] Vesamora: I have electric plush toast hand warmers on at the moment
[3:31:26] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I an electric blanket when it it -00 temps; my windows are metal and conduct the cold.
[3:31:28] MachoCham: Dan heel turn
[3:31:43] kpatt17: I hear they make weighted hoodies now a days. Would love one of those.
[3:31:51] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: *bought an
[3:31:55] Vesamora: I'm always cold because I lost like 50 pounds of body weight
[3:32:01] fooxytv: Is they a prereq to use the follower dungeons?
[3:32:02] RAF_Sean: Never gonna make those Twitter-bucks deleting posts
[3:32:13] S3N71: Like an Oodie?
[3:32:21] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:32:26] MrEvilRex: @Vesamora fat or muscle/bones?
[3:32:37] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Followers needs a 60 toon.
[3:32:39] Harai_Ulfsark: @fooxytv as long as you can queue for DF normals
[3:32:42] MachoCham: I want a Bluey oodie
[3:33:00] Vesamora: @MrEvilRex fat and some muscle from just overall weight loss
[3:33:05] S3N71: SoD Druid just dinged 25 :)
[3:33:16] Vesamora: voluntary/intentional weight loss
[3:33:22] MrEvilRex: I understand the weighted blanket, but why would ppl want heavy clothing
[3:33:25] MrEvilRex: @Vesamora grats
[3:33:26] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I have a boyfriend's sweater from the 90's when I stole it.
[3:33:33] MrEvilRex: brb work call
[3:33:39] chelfx: Celestalon tweeted saying he is safe
[3:33:49] Nativ_TV: Helloooow
[3:33:56] MachoCham: @MrEvilRex It can really help with sensory issues
[3:34:08] MachoCham: Yeah it's a slow trickle of news atm
[3:34:08] NeeK_23: Raven and CoD seem to be hit hard so far
[3:34:14] MachoCham: Like a shit version of GCSE day
[3:34:46] Nativ_TV: How are you today?
[3:34:46] SlithTheSivak: turns out that skull and crossbones on the Blizz roadmap was the death of 2k employees...
[3:34:49] NeeK_23: I expect the Cali teams are in meeting right now
[3:35:00] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Now that you put out the patch, we don't need you anymore.  Have a good life!
[3:35:32] funviking99: the grim campfire makes sense now
[3:35:42] MachoCham: I honestly expect a PR mitigation with 10.2.6 news very soon
[3:36:32] MediumRareOG: i think they'll push news until next week
[3:36:33] Nativ_TV: Sup
[3:36:38] Garrand52: I've been laid off once .. it was like a kick to the nuts
[3:36:45] jhopps12: jhopps12 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:36:58] Nativ_TV: All good, busy successful streamer :P
[3:36:59] MachoCham: OFC it's icky, but sadly it's not about ethics
[3:37:08] MediumRareOG: they might've fired the person responsible for unscheduling the news
[3:37:12] jhopps12: my wife was laid off last year, it's life altering
[3:37:17] Nativ_TV: You
[3:38:16] chelfx: Something happen similar yesterday in hockey some bad news was posted and hour later the NHL posted they are starting to expanding to new a city could be coincidence but was PR
[3:38:28] chelfx: bad pr**
[3:38:53] amricatt: I have been laid off twice, once while on medical leave and once very similar to Microsoft.  It really is life alterating. But, you get through it and often times your future job is much better.
[3:39:04] MediumRareOG: Unfortunately the lessons from layoffs are 1) don't ever show loyalty to a company and 2) your work colleagues aren't your friends, particularly your manager
[3:39:10] Garrand52: cut the pay of the ppl at the top .. get your lower down staff
[3:39:21] Garrand52: *keep your
[3:39:23] Fennithos: @MediumRareOG 100%
[3:39:25] Harai_Ulfsark: there are no more satoru iwatas in the world
[3:39:34] khalcrux_gaming: Yeah they just replaced Bobby with other Bobby
[3:40:00] S3N71: I've a meeting with my manager and HR next week.  I developed a progressive generative condition back that has affected my ability to attend work.  They have put in everything they can to support me, but if the meeting goes the way I think it, it may be Twitch Prime for you going forward x
[3:40:41] S3N71: Aye
[3:40:48] MediumRareOG: Like I tell people "don't quit your job until you've started your new one". Companies have been rescinding job offers. Just stop showing up
[3:40:57] databob1: yes they can
[3:41:02] khalcrux_gaming: I never share my secrets or train my replacements. Any time I can I make losing me have a cost.
[3:41:43] MediumRareOG: Layoffs generally just pick names from a spreadsheet
[3:41:56] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: What levels are good for in here?
[3:42:05] khalcrux_gaming: Depending on the scope yes
[3:42:05] SlithTheSivak: nepotism is obv a factor
[3:42:07] amricatt: I got laid off for having a specific job title.
[3:42:07] kpatt17: I would think it depends on the company?
[3:42:09] Xesol: 1900 people though they probably just axed entire teams
[3:42:13] ascendence94: @MrGM im pretty sure if u have some type of note from the doctor saying that u cant be in cuz of this medical condition they cant really fire u for it
[3:42:14] funviking99: sometimes you need to clean a bit, new company takes over and it‚Äôs expected
[3:42:34] slyrac12: Bro you gotta try Palworld. Most fun I've had playing a video game since like WOTLK lol. Not WoW content but it sure would be entertaining
[3:42:38] MediumRareOG: Layoffs have to be indiscriminate or they can get sued. Fire too many women or minorities, you get sued for discrimination, for example
[3:42:39] funviking99: exactly
[3:42:45] SlithTheSivak: theyd just say he was fired for something else, not the medical condition
[3:42:45] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[3:42:57] chelfx: i guess it also depends on the state in USA some USA laws are kinda shitty with the medical condition firing
[3:42:59] Fennithos: In the US if you sign up for FMLA or ADAAA due to personal or family medical needs you are often times protected from termination in some instances.
[3:43:01] MachoCham: In most contracts you can be let go for medically being unable to do your duties
[3:43:09] nuclearphosphate: @slyrac12 its not good so buggy and the crafting isnt as good as it could be
[3:43:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:43:16] slyrac12: Yeah for sure
[3:43:16] amricatt: @ascendence94 My state in the US is an at will state.  Unfortunately me being on medical leave did not stop them from eliminating my position.
[3:43:23] S3N71: @ascendence94 Under UK law, they have an obligation to make reasonable changes, but if your attendance continues to fall outside of acceptable levels, they can ultimately dismiss you.
[3:43:55] Garrand52: i know people who got fired and re-hired on more shitty pay
[3:44:12] SlithTheSivak: they hired for new positions
[3:44:17] MediumRareOG: @amricatt "at will" doesn't mean what people seem to think it means. It DOES NOT mean they can fire you anytime for any reason
[3:44:18] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Is Rumble making money?
[3:44:25] chelfx: Bel twitted that Survival game has been in development hell for years for
[3:44:35] michaelmm: I recall a few folks had it in their Twitter bio. Likely a mix of OG and new hires.
[3:44:47] nuclearphosphate: will BfA raid content EVER be soloable?
[3:44:52] ascendence94: @S3N71 ya but that different right if ur attendence keeps showing less like that than most like like its not the condition its you just missing work
[3:44:59] michaelmm: It was super secret tho so nobody really spoke about it.
[3:45:18] thughesy: what‚Äôs a good alliance server to play on?
[3:45:22] Garrand52: Blizz be like You think you got a job here .. but you don't !
[3:45:22] ascendence94: and if u were unable to medically do the job in the first place than hiring you was prob a mistake in the first place and they realized that
[3:45:24] chelfx: Game Producer Unannounced Survival just tweeted they got layed off
[3:45:51] Harai_Ulfsark: i wish we had any leaks about the survival game, it got ultimately curious about it
[3:45:52] chelfx: posted on discord
[3:45:56] S3N71: @ascendence94 Agree totally.  We have return to work interviews to ascertain the reason for the absence for that very reason
[3:45:59] MediumRareOG: I suspect many of the layoffs will beon the survival game
[3:46:12] khalcrux_gaming: Rumble is so sad. I love the game but it's so flooded with micro transactions.
[3:46:32] Redivna: :(
[3:46:38] thunduz: terrible!
[3:46:45] MachoCham: Under UK Law, if there are no more reasonable adjustments that can be made for an employee, then a company can dismiss anyone. Even if it's a disability
[3:46:54] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I hate hearing that.
[3:46:55] amricatt: @MediumRareOG True.  Part of it was my fault.  I was young at the time and didn't realize I could protect myself further with FMLA. I did look into the legality and basically, they could do what they do.
[3:47:14] S3N71: @ascendence94 I'm a manager, so I can see both sides of the coin, I truly can.  They are simply following the policy, nothing more
[3:47:27] RAF_Sean: Your auto mod hates me
[3:47:33] MachoCham: Nah Automod hates links
[3:48:22] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: How much would the top 3 tiers need to have their salary reduced to keep those 1900?
[3:48:48] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:49:05] ascendence94: @S3N71 ya i get that 100 percent
[3:49:13] MachoCham: From a business point of view: if that position is truly redundant and that person would have nothing to do then unfortunately no matter how much Bobby got paid off they're not staying on.
[3:49:23] databob1: it must be hard to count your money with all that blood on it
[3:49:28] RAF_Sean: That‚Äôs the thing that fucking ruins me. When Nintendo stumbled with WiiU Iwata took a 50% pay cut to avoid lay offs. But these companies aren‚Äôt struggling. They‚Äôre making record fucking profits and still cutting people
[3:49:32] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Have to pay Bobby's severance somehow. :(
[3:49:51] MachoCham: Any reasonable company would not pay someone $70k a year to just sit in a chair
[3:49:59] Eggz1004: that legendary reward from the mission table is to get an azerite essence i think
[3:50:01] SlithTheSivak: they're putting the workers in their place
[3:50:11] Harai_Ulfsark: there's no other way we need harsher regulations on those companies
[3:50:19] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:50:21] Eggz1004: yep
[3:50:23] Redivna: what's wild to me, is that they are stopping production on the survival game for projects earlier in production
[3:50:41] RAF_Sean: @machocham no but you can create work for those people by expanding your programs
[3:50:51] MachoCham: 6 years
[3:50:52] RAF_Sean: or lessen the work load for others to increase quality of life
[3:51:07] chelfx: @Redivna it was in development for 6 years, and from people tweeting sounds like it was dev hell
[3:51:22] Harai_Ulfsark: maybe they lost the timing to release the survival game tbh, plenty of other survival games launched, got hyped up and now the fad is gone
[3:51:22] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Like Bloodlines 2
[3:51:34] ActuallyArcane: @jhopps12 WAIT NO
[3:51:42] MachoCham: @RAF_Sean Which is fair if they're in a position where you can expand a program. You only need so many Admin roles. Everyone assumes all 1800 roles are Dev
[3:51:44] wastedxtime93: D4 new season is already a shit show too tho
[3:52:04] ActuallyArcane: D4 season is fine...
[3:52:04] wastedxtime93: Its just bad and like everyone is against it.
[3:52:10] MachoCham: D4 in general has been a shitshow
[3:52:15] Nativ_TV: Yayyyy
[3:52:24] RAF_Sean: @machocham oh no I expect most will be CS, QA, CM and HR
[3:52:35] chelfx: what was his twitter
[3:52:45] Nativ_TV: Are you planning to try PoE2?
[3:53:04] S3N71: That's the worse part of being laid off.  You're not normally allowed back on the premises to say goodbye
[3:53:12] SlithTheSivak: too bad they never got that union off the ground
[3:53:17] MachoCham: @RAF_Sean Yeah and as shit as it is, hopefully those roles are less industry specific and easier for them to fine new positions for
[3:53:20] Nativ_TV: Same
[3:53:30] Nativ_TV: I heard amazing things about it
[3:53:41] Nativ_TV: I think I will start on PoE2, I didn't play PoE
[3:53:52] S3N71: Well, that and financial insecurity, anxiety about paying bills.  That was a really silly comment, can a mode delete it please
[3:54:02] Nativ_TV: But if there is something im waiting for is actually Ashes of Creation
[3:54:06] Vesamora: Don't know why you wouldn't play there
[3:54:23] Layliah79: With most big companies you're taken into a room to be told you're let go. Next someone else gathers your belongings while you wait. Finally they all can escort you out of the building.
[3:54:37] Nativ_TV: I played Alpha 1 AoC
[3:54:43] MachoCham: Oh an actual WoW question
[3:54:45] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS from Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[3:54:46] Layliah79: Yep! I know a few like that in US
[3:54:54] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I think I'd at least like to say goodbye to folks.
[3:54:55] Layliah79: so if they didn't get to say goodbye to their peers - that could be why
[3:54:58] SlithTheSivak: my boss at microsoft got nabbed by security and escorted out of the building
[3:54:59] jhopps12: yeah that happened to my wife, who is the quietest person ever. they didn't allow her to get her own things
[3:55:01] MachoCham: Yeah, to stop you going stealing data or anything
[3:55:10] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: If you've been there 13 years, then you're a team.
[3:55:16] MediumRareOG: Stuff in a box like that is pretty unusual. That's more of a firing type thing
[3:55:27] Garrand52: if anyone put my stuff form my desk in a box .. they would be leaving in one too
[3:55:38] Harai_Ulfsark: supposedly that's what happened between lineage III and Tera
[3:55:38] Nativ_TV: I mean even though I played Alpha 1 of AoC, and I liked it but honestly, it is nothing compared to how the game will turn out, not even the same engine, the game will be so much better and its amazing
[3:56:00] MediumRareOG: Most layoffs now are on Zoom. Might not even be 1:1. Could be 300 people in a meeting, somebody says "i'm sorry but you're all laid off" and they lose their network access immediately
[3:56:14] MachoCham: Wow Question: You only have one chance at the lego a week, does it matter at what difficulty level you do it? I mean if I did it on LFR it's the same as if I did on heroic?
[3:56:26] Nativ_TV: @MediumRareOG Which company?
[3:56:30] DevoidX: can't do that in the UK & EU, thankfully.
[3:56:32] MachoCham: @MediumRareOG the case for many larger departments
[3:56:34] Ryakkan: They trust you to work at the company, but as soon as they fire you they treat you like a criminal ready to steal everything.
[3:56:43] MediumRareOG: Mass layoff meetings are pretty common for large companies
[3:56:52] Eggz1004: should be a higher chance at the higher difficulty
[3:57:10] Eggz1004: chance to get it is the same concept as the evoker leggo
[3:57:10] Harai_Ulfsark: @MachoCham each difficulty is one roll, if you do mythic you'll roll 3 times and that includes the lower difficulties
[3:57:12] ActuallyArcane: They have canceled the project, so that tracks, the vast majority of posts I am seeing are that team
[3:57:41] MediumRareOG: Locking you out may seem cruel but it's for your protection too. You can't be accused of stealing or damaging anything if you've had your access cut off
[3:57:44] Redivna: you get a chance for each difficulty level @machocham and you get a combined chance at the higher difficulties. So heroic will include the chance as if you did normal and LFR
[3:57:49] SlithTheSivak: ugh, gut punch
[3:58:24] Redivna: you also get extra tokens at heroic and higher that you can use to increase your chance of getting it
[3:58:26] ActuallyArcane: This is a heartbreaking day
[3:58:35] Layliah79: i wonder if any of that survival team were people from that other team blizzard acquired a few  years back.
[3:58:42] IAmScarlett__: @ActuallyArcane i agree
[3:58:53] ActuallyArcane: Trying to pay attention at work and instead lurking on streams and twitter for news...
[3:58:59] MachoCham: @Harai_Ulfsark Perfect thank you for the clarification all <3
[3:59:14] Getcha_Pulll: Those items you learned are very expensive on AH. you could sell them lol
[3:59:34] Redivna: I hope they don't announce anything either, since the community teams are just gonna get hammered for posting anything
[3:59:35] Nativ_TV: I mean you can can't really blame the company, it is a very high risk that people can sell the company information after being fired, get as much da ta as possible before being kicked from the systems, that is reality and it happened many times, I agree that it is a little inhuman those mass layoffs and fast firing but it is minimizing risks
[3:59:40] ActuallyArcane: What was the link for the survival team announcement?
[3:59:47] Eggz1004: prices have dropped dramatically for those
[3:59:50] MrGM: https://twitter.com/QuitevFX/status/1750572872551272708
[3:59:54] ActuallyArcane: Thank you
[4:00:06] ImperfectDark: wooo! i just got the Reins of the Raven Lord
[4:00:07] Nativ_TV: right?
[4:00:25] Nativ_TV: What is your opinion on what I wrote?
[4:00:33] databob1: @mrgm yeah but they are just workers they're not important not like a CEO or a shareholder...*Heavy Sarcasm*
[4:00:35] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Grats.
[4:00:37] Redivna: congrats @imperfectdark !
[4:00:39] Eggz1004: @ImperfectDark grats!
[4:00:39] Sammonia: The real hard ones to finish in Islands now will be the PVP ones.
[4:00:39] khalcrux_gaming: Mike Ybarra peaced out. Just hearing some of this.
[4:00:49] MediumRareOG: I don't like how you do Islands completionism. It's RNG spawns. I can't be bothered
[4:00:54] stregnor: so did Allen Adham
[4:01:21] SlithTheSivak: @MrGM people did it while i was working there multiple times at microsoft
[4:01:34] middleagerookie: I finally got the Plundered Blade of the Northern Kings to try and make some gold and they announce a recolour coming the Trading Post :|
[4:01:35] uSeren_: was just wondering that myself. Missing all the pvp achivs from islands
[4:01:48] middleagerookie: Ya
[4:01:52] Sammonia: I have no idea. I did PVP islands as current content because I figured it would be impossible past BFA
[4:01:53] Nativ_TV: Thats where you are wrong, many would, people will act irrationally when they are hurt emotionally, and they want "revenge" at the company and basically thats their only chance
[4:01:58] SlithTheSivak: the funny thing is they often do it for clout, not even money
[4:02:02] dright424: Companies announce in press releases because they need to do WARN notices, so it will be announced to the public anyways. Better to get ahead of the news.
[4:02:14] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Wonder if you can get a friend from the other faction to join you/fight you.
[4:02:20] uSeren_: i guess you find 5 people and do a "win" trade on each island
[4:02:24] MediumRareOG: WoD gladiator's sanctum has that same pvp-old content problem

[4:03:29] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Execs are in meetings with CMs.....
[4:03:40] Layliah79: i feel for them. i've been layed off from a job before.
[4:03:42] Sammonia: I've been avoiding the heck out of the "knock people off their drakes in PVP" achievement but it also will be impossible past DF. I should do it.
[4:03:49] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It's just a guess based on my past history.

[4:04:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I've had a company merger that I found out they were changing hands and the Execs kept having meetings.  I sneaked away because the new company was horrible.
[4:04:46] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: *snuck
[4:04:49] jhopps12: Sarah Cotner just tweeted she's stil in limbo
[4:05:07] RAF_Sean: Oh sorry
[4:05:08] JakeSezz: Is it? I just saw it on Twitter and don‚Äôt realize it had been released
[4:05:10] Layliah79: wonder who the new Pres will be.
[4:05:15] Layliah79: doubt Chris Metzen
[4:05:28] JakeSezz: it‚Äôs worse than layoffs
[4:05:35] JakeSezz: somehow
[4:05:56] JakeSezz: Yeah he was accused of a few things but I hadn‚Äôt heard the trafficking part
[4:06:09] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I wouldn't see Chris over the entire lot.  He'd been in the WoW department.
[4:06:18] chelfx: @Layliah79 Chris Metzen is to much of a creative to be Pres

[4:08:33] Thoreya: pvp islands had potential
[4:08:38] button_moon: All my favourite content is from BFA
[4:08:46] Thoreya: pvp islands..and PVP warfronts oh man
[4:09:15] Vandosz: warfronts should have just been new battlegrounds
[4:09:20] chelfx: Am i the only one who liked warfronts?
[4:09:45] Thoreya: i remember friday nights drinking beers and spamming warfronts on all my alts lol
[4:09:47] Thesaroustv: what are you getting from those  pvp?
[4:09:47] Thoreya: jeez man
[4:09:50] ItsRammen: Looks like most if not all of the last of the "real" non outsourced CS (Game Masters) from Austin and Cork are being let go.

[4:10:55] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: This is a level 70? Can you run it on a 68 and walk things?
[4:11:17] Jaspur_Fluffpaw: AI customer support phone tree?
[4:11:26] MediumRareOG: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm at 68 you might be ilvl 280. at 70 you'll be 440
[4:11:48] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: What used to take 3 days will now take a week dealing with GMs?
[4:11:58] MrEvilRex: everyone is just using bots as customer service anyways
[4:12:01] jhopps12: D4 level artist is gone too... maybe I should stop sharing this info lol
[4:12:45] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:12:50] Layliah79: wonder how many were on that survival game team
[4:13:03] S3N71: They just announced TWW, I guess the redundancies are going to be less there
[4:13:10] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Sacked.
[4:13:11] Goblocker: Do we know what the survival game was about at all?
[4:13:12] Vandosz: fucked
[4:13:22] Layliah79: meant out of the total lay offs - how many were only from that game vs other teams
[4:13:40] MrEvilRex: what survival game? which universe was it based in or was it a new universe IP?
[4:13:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: How many people does it take to make a game?
[4:13:55] MrEvilRex: ah okay cool
[4:13:58] MrEvilRex: shame
[4:14:06] RAF_Sean: I may have missed it walking back from the shop but do we know what team DanShoeHsu was on that lost 1/3rd of their team?
[4:14:12] Vandosz: Honestly im finishing my study this year and im gonna enter either the game or entertainment industry (film) both are laying off people one by one. not optimistic about this lol
[4:14:15] chelfx: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm 1 to 1000 people
[4:14:21] MrEvilRex: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm depends on what type of game, and what grade, indie A, AA, AAA?
[4:14:37] IAmScarlett__: i see it
[4:14:46] khalcrux_gaming: Uh oh

[4:15:03] IAmScarlett__: it was this
[4:15:04] IAmScarlett__: Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been laid off along with my fellow Game Masters.
[4:15:09] Garrand52: why are you blocked ?
[4:15:10] Akela3: you know what you did
[4:15:11] RAF_Sean: Maybe they saw your tweet and didn't realize
[4:15:12] MrEvilRex: shoulda deleted the tweet, maybe they misunderstood
[4:15:20] Vandosz: one of those blocking lists, you probably follow or retweeted someone thats on the blacklist or something
[4:15:39] Harai_Ulfsark: Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been laid off along with my fellow Game Masters. Northsings I don‚Äôt have anything to say right now. Will update later if there‚Äôs news. What a month, huh.
[4:16:06] jhopps12: ^^ that's the tweet
[4:16:31] Harai_Ulfsark: Texas it seems
[4:16:47] FishcrowBirb: sometimes I mute you because spoilers, sorry dude
[4:17:08] MrEvilRex: @MrGM if someone blocks you for no reason, you should give them a reason to block you.
[4:17:19] Harai_Ulfsark: also there are a few addons to automatically block blue twitter users
[4:17:32] Harai_Ulfsark: ... i may or may not have used one of those in the past
[4:17:42] chelfx: im see wow devs saying they are still in limbo
[4:17:53] chelfx: seeing**
[4:18:08] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I know very little about Twitter but that's the second time I've seen "blue user."  What does that mean?
[4:18:49] MrEvilRex: so you pay money to get money?
[4:19:05] Harai_Ulfsark: blue users always appear at the top of comments on posts, and generally they have the worse takes on everything just to trend
[4:19:06] Garrand52: Musk needs his $$$
[4:19:08] khalcrux_gaming: Memo: The canceling of the survival game was to "redeploy resources". They all got laid off.
[4:19:17] MrEvilRex: do you profit, or break even at least @MrGM
[4:19:41] MrEvilRex: well at least it breaks even
[4:19:51] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Company-speak.
[4:19:55] Harai_Ulfsark: also 90% of blue twitter users are always promoting their new crypto scam
[4:19:57] Akela3: @khalcrux_gaming "resources" was probably money in PR speak in this case
[4:20:09] keyboardturner: Kappa
[4:20:17] JakeSezz: That‚Äôs kinda what I do with streaming. It helps pay for Fortnite Battle Pass & Ultimate Game Pass mrgmHehe
[4:20:39] MrEvilRex: "crypto is not a scam" same ppl that say "guns don't kill people"
[4:20:47] MediumRareOG: Remember when Crypto Andys couldn't stop bleating about NFTs? Glad those days are over
[4:21:02] MrEvilRex: Lol NFTs
[4:21:12] keyboardturner: the ones who made money were on the top (hence pyramid scheme)
[4:21:16] MrEvilRex: Crypto and NFTs are a game of hot potato...
[4:21:27] zahadem: Bro, i saw a weird video about you on youtube, some guy was on a wild goose chase saying you steal his content KEKW
[4:21:30] MrEvilRex: I'm not getting lag
[4:21:41] keyboardturner: honestly i'm kind of glad there's no news
[4:22:04] Redivna: W
