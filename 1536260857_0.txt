[0:20:52] Honvar: @geokouts Not only in the UK, in Belgium it is 35 atm
[0:20:53] Buckwink: DF at the end of the year is gonna make me take an entire month off from work
[0:20:56] matx83: Yes here in UK we just broken our high temp record

[0:22:35] 91Niki: Here it's 31-32C. A little too hot for me, but rather that tan 39 towOof
[0:22:47] 91Niki: than*
[0:23:01] Thoreya: 80 degrees here in florida. very grateful for central air lol
[0:23:26] ObamaEnvy: cbrahGood
[0:23:29] Honvar: @91Niki I'm a winter guy so 35 is killing me
[0:23:30] geokouts: 29 and for second day in a row windy too
[0:23:32] Wolfenhoof: 34 outside, 26 inside and i feel the heat is creeping slowly throught the walls and roof in my direction ScaredyCat
[0:23:56] 91Niki: @Thoreya Yeaah, countries like UK, and most northern / mid EU countries don't have Airco and the houses are build to keep heat inside. Pavements are literally melting in the heatwave over there D:
[0:24:32] Thoreya: hopefully they get on the AC train soon
[0:24:38] 91Niki: @Honvar I'm Scandinavian, I ain't build for heat LUL
[0:24:53] Honvar: I'm glad we have a mobile AC, it helps a bit
[0:25:00] 91Niki: @Thoreya Yeah hopefully. Prices of airco is insane over there. Hopefully it drops and becomes a norm
[0:25:40] Khailaan: I wish man, living 8 stories high in this heat is killing me
[0:25:58] Honvar: @91Niki As a Belgian I don't like it neither
[0:26:01] Wolfenhoof: @Thoreya No worries, with the raising engery costs caused by the war most people can't afford to run such things anyway Kappa
[0:26:19] 91Niki: Saw a really good trick with how to keep heat out. Close all windows. Put soaped water on your windows and use it to stick tinfoil on the windows to reflect the light and heat
[0:26:26] fire_fawkes: Meanwhile all the Americans are like 34 is cold almost freezing bc we use F not C
[0:26:41] Dherjee: man, eu servers are infested with RMT goldfarmers atm, it's crazy

[0:27:37] Wolfenhoof: @Thoreya I rather sweat and eat than starve in a comfortable temperature, but then again i am maybe a little oldschool in such matters Kappa
[0:28:22] Honvar: @fire_fawkes It is like 95 F in Belgium atm
[0:28:34] 91Niki: I'm gonna go grab breakfast. Try and behave in chat while I'm gone sacPAT
[0:28:41] mavericks312: being a landscaper for 5 years you learn to live with the heat and it's not that bad

[0:29:36] 91Niki: 40C = 104F, you're welcome. brb
[0:29:40] Thoreya: i always felt like a 0-100 grade is easier to follow than the celsius way
[0:29:48] AxurlizTTV: !YT
[0:29:48] Moobot: @AxurlizTTV Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW Editable UI System - DRAGONFLIGHT ALPHA EXCLUSIVE youtu.be/jst2FvVYB00
[0:30:17] supercoupletv: Im really tempted to play WoW, because of this Nice guy Towellie, should I play it?
[0:30:27] Thoreya: yes
[0:30:40] geokouts: there is ALWAYS the trial version, not much but it is something
[0:30:48] Wolfenhoof: @supercoupletv Its worth it alone to be able to play such a graceful and beautiful creature as a tauren.
[0:30:51] PriddyFresh: I'd say the best time to play is when dragonflight comes out
[0:30:56] Honvar: @Thoreya Like the metric system, Celsius is superior Kappa
[0:31:29] Wolfenhoof: And i kinda agree with Priddy, best time to start is the pre patch of DF in a couple of weeks (or months, lul).
[0:31:34] geokouts: in the US they use the metric system but not widely, ammo and drugs
[0:31:37] supercoupletv: do'nt have any friends to play the game, am I able to go through story Alone doing the Quests?
[0:31:41] Docta_G: pre-patch is always best time
[0:31:49] Honvar: @supercoupletv Yes
[0:31:52] TheCliffyShow: @supercoupletv Yes
[0:32:10] belfastcl: I recently started wow again, will prob farm transmogs and mounts till dragonflight, maybe level a few chars
[0:32:10] geokouts: there will always be people you can get help with
[0:32:12] robert_332: morning all
[0:32:23] Herzenliegen: If they've never played starting before DF isn't bad either.
[0:32:26] supercoupletv: alright thank you, I went through the list of servers as well, should I pick a almost full server?
[0:32:31] Wolfenhoof: Even if you play all raids you miss parts because they spread it to books Kappa  But i play on my own since 10+ years as well and its fine.
[0:32:38] Thoreya: season 4 is 2 weeks from today. completely forgot about that
[0:32:39] headshot_hunter6: got damn its hot... 98.6f here today
[0:33:02] geokouts: some servers are conenected so i dont think that counts
[0:33:17] Thoreya: time to reroll outlaw rogue
[0:33:37] supercoupletv: thanks for the tips guys
[0:33:40] wvivar: Las Vegas is 98 atm moved here from LA two weeks ago
[0:33:49] geokouts: outlaw rogue fun, sub and assasin needs you to be expert
[0:34:00] Wolfenhoof: Taurenrogues are such a glorious things. Now i wait for my flying kodos.
[0:34:08] Thoreya: i feel like assa is def the easiest of the 3

[1:36:43] MisterBongwater: The aspects are lore towelliee that doesn’t show up on raidbots
[1:36:52] andrejhmm: @Towelliee The enemies are the Elamentalists. They represent the Elements, not the Aspects. Because it's the Primordial Element Dragons we are fighting.
[1:36:53] sliproach: @Towelliee these are the people we play with :(
[1:36:54] ZeusDNA: "Fuckin lore nerds ruining our conversation"
[1:36:54] LimeWire_Virus: Why 5 colors? Going to be the new meme?

[1:41:00] Rabiahtaro132: The white weapons could have been storm.
[1:41:00] Sollice: Warlock tier set

[1:41:10] Armdel: mop dungeon set

[1:41:11] generaljosh721: Those look good
[1:41:12] Valaurus: yah there's a warlock set that's similar
[1:41:16] ninedraft317: warrior?
[1:41:17] kranztheman: The face
[1:41:18] PadidinJones: @Towelliee lock and cloth helms
[1:41:20] BoezIRL: warrior legion set
[1:41:22] Mitune: Yes it was mop
[1:41:22] Klarynse: yes mists
[1:41:23] tr1ckshot22: looks similar to lock tier gear
[1:41:24] barbarlarbar: Paladin helm?
[1:41:25] Templexx: purple = win
[1:41:26] theDirtyon3: looks like the lock helm from sepulcher
[1:41:26] Scoodles91: legion warrior set
[1:41:26] ShadoodHD: like a torture mask monkaS
[1:41:37] Daarksyde: faceplate for cloth is interesting.... so its cloth faceplate?...
[1:41:39] bowsers1: same
[1:41:45] PriddyFresh: I'm calling it now, the aspects are going to come together to create the Captain planet aspect and defeat help defeat the main raid boss lol
[1:41:49] Kriven: blue for me
[1:41:50] misterquid: weird
[1:41:51] OviTheGray: there may be more dragon colors but i belive only the 5 are actual aspects
[1:41:53] Sollice: Did he say he loves LeBrons
[1:41:54] abracka_: the only helm from recent memory i can think of that looks kind of like the face plate is the warlock tier from legion
[1:41:55] literally_human_garbage: I'm partial to the blue
[1:41:55] tebbix: yeah bronze is op
[1:41:55] PadidinJones: Labroooonz James

[1:41:57] brian_777777777: a lot of people don't like the rogue set
[1:42:01] akia03: so do we pick a aspect like we pick a covenant? @Towelliee
[1:42:01] Fyeah: black dragonflight andy
[1:42:02] Fugazi811: why 5 colors?
[1:42:05] kranztheman: The red aspect looks the best to me.
[1:42:15] Skyxiemeister: atleast they are making the armolr look good in dragonflight compared to what we got in shadowlands x)
[1:42:26] Alienfromger: why bronze if you could have gold
[1:42:26] denflup: yeah fuck that
[1:42:28] adambtwitchtv: covenent KEKW
[1:42:31] Rabiahtaro132: WhY FiVe CoLoRs
[1:42:43] andrejhmm: @andrejhmm But it is the Elements because you are fighting the Elemental Primordial Dragons and Elementalists and the Elements. That is why tier gear mostly rocks. The colors have nothing to do with aspects.
[1:42:49] Daarksyde: sooo raid boss will be Captain Pollution?
[1:42:52] dimofodi: I would have thought the 5 colors would be for the 4 raid modes and PVP. :D
[1:42:53] Xsidious: About time raid and pvp sets are different
[1:42:53] Sollice: To be fair in Shadowlands was kind of a shitty meaningful choice. Like did you want to keep your arms or your legs kind of thing
[1:42:54] ShadoodHD: and i'm sure the aspects are gonna try to bring back the old fucking gods as usual, tell me im wrong towTinfoil

[1:43:22] Daarksyde: "a breath of fresh comments"...
[1:43:27] Sollice: @andrejhmm Yes....the first raid is fighting Primordials thats why its rocky. We know.
[1:43:29] kirtyalex: nice
[1:43:38] Dathas487: Oh nice flavor change
[1:43:42] Jereico: the visage thing just seems good

[1:43:58] TheCliffyShow: So riding on dragons in dracthyr form. Dragon on dragon action.
[1:43:59] Dathas487: So like you land after a soar and instantly turn into your visage that's pretty cool
[1:44:12] andrejhmm: @andrejhmm So the colors represent the Elements, not the Aspects.
[1:44:15] Nixis: Thats Nice
[1:44:20] CommanderKrano: YES! Oh, i hoped they would do that. i prefer the Viage form to the dragon form :D

[1:52:53] NotYetRatedd: Max kinda hinted as well LUL
[1:52:58] Rabiahtaro132: He guessed right about the alpha day, and you're doubting him now?
[1:53:02] h116_: they also said it in an interview
[1:53:08] dracullus: max heard it here, you heard it on max channel
[1:53:11] Ponickz: Towellie gets lucky most of the time mmochampion 2022

[1:54:26] almostdps: dungeons are personal all the time
[1:54:28] temp3st98: for now right?
[1:54:28] h116_: yes he said raids
[1:54:29] Herzenliegen: yes
[1:54:30] icerasta: yeah, raid only
[1:54:31] Jereico: Yeah, as opposed to also dungeons and world content
[1:54:32] djingies: @towelliee do you know if there has been any mentions of whether you’ll be able to log into both wotlk and dragonflight simultaneously with both releases coming up?
[1:54:33] procyon_mfc: He indicated only raids

[1:54:35] OnceAMoose: Towelliee is the Adam Schefter of WoW

[1:55:48] Lanyxboy: do you think we will have earlier access to evoker before the release? like with demonhunter @Towelliee
[1:55:49] Sollice: Yes please. Raiding for literal months and getting 1 or 2 pieces of loot sucks ass
[1:56:02] PvtHudson093: 8 weeks for the catalyst was far too long
[1:56:29] paradoxyy: They have to make Player vs Player real time races or its doomed

[1:56:48] brian_777777777: i dont know how social they think raiding is i barely know my guildmates and asking them for loot puts a weird dynamic in our friendship
[1:56:50] Meakis: hi chat
[1:56:56] backstreetalright: Dumb question - does evoker start at lvl 60?
[1:57:03] Svendv: 55 @vipervirus9
[1:57:08] MrMoistToad: when is sl season 4?
[1:57:08] teatimetox: 58

[1:58:06] Meakis: accessories to the dragon itself for race wins
[1:58:09] AxurlizTTV: cosmetics for races would be a nice thing. but no reason to make it super competetive
[1:58:12] khazroi: As far as I can see, there is nothing really new and refreshing in the new expansion
[1:58:12] SphinxyOCE: @PharoGames would be weird to not have them when pre patch goes live tbh
[1:58:13] xthemoose: people always find something to complain about, annoying lmao
[1:58:15] Rabiahtaro132: "Dragonriding gamer pass!"
[1:58:19] CraftyClaw: maybe just a leaderboard and some nice cosmetic rewards for doing races and for winning so many
[1:58:23] jeflag: need for speed : dragonflight
[1:58:24] TatarosTV: to be fair, dragon flight looks like the end game content LUL

[1:59:15] ShadoodHD: @Aquadriel OMEGALUL
[1:59:16] Tryhardion: @Towelliee hey, how many action bars can you have by default?
[1:59:17] Shakenbaked: Towelliee u should make a "Reaction video" on your interview with Ion and agree with everything u asked, easy.

[2:49:17] Clicklesly: Not with conduits going away
[2:49:17] iamspacemanspiff: nothing any more, just to mark something that stealths
[2:49:18] Rabiahtaro132: Big garbage.
[2:49:19] jasperboy: neh
[2:49:20] Samiccus: @Towelliee would be hilarious if they had a screen message that says "beware the eye of Ion has targeted you"

[2:55:08] Toon_irl: Is it confirmed theres a new alpha build today?
[2:55:17] Sollice: @Ragnarage95 I doubt all classes. It's a lot of work for them to rig armor etc
[2:55:30] htomek: if u can do good dps and have fun then thats the best possible outcome
[2:55:33] raye_gaming22: that trinekt is cursed i have 16 xymox kills and no trinket

[2:57:47] strchsr: @Towelliee The only ones that were pretty barebones were Monk and Warlock from the datamining
[2:57:49] branbee: wheres warlock
[2:57:59] MarshallOnline: i hope havoc demon hunter gets some buffs this xpack

[2:59:09] strchsr: @Towelliee I have a friend who has me on their Friends & Family list, does that make my chances pretty good? I've never been in an alpha but I was in several betas
[2:59:10] aistahh: CE, above 3k io, hope I get into the alpha

[3:00:02] futomara01: BRING BACK OG BARRAGE
[3:00:03] Zyricks: they nerfed it to the ground
[3:00:04] strchsr: @Towelliee It's on the other side of the Hunter tree about as far down as Stampede is
[3:00:12] VHFrey: It's class tree, but it's ass, no one plays it atm
[3:00:14] notsupportiv: @towelliee barrage was on the class tree
[3:00:14] danielthegathering: do you have any transmog unlocked?
[3:00:19] Tizbit: did ion say there will be a pvp alpha where they inv all the pvpers when it's rdy?
[3:00:23] The_Tacozilla: towF
[3:00:23] Sollice: Barrage is one of the main reasons for the huntard naming
[3:00:34] Dinermoe: isnt barrage in the class tree?
[3:00:38] OviTheGray: barrage is good for legacy raid/dungeon farming
[3:00:46] Gapplebees1: Barrage needs to do like 4x damage to be relevant
[3:00:50] luchion09: hahaha 250 :P
[3:00:54] Aertharion: lol I aint. Im only ilvl 196
[3:00:58] danielthegathering: what about people in greens?
[3:00:59] Klarynse: towHype
[3:01:02] raye_gaming22: season 4 is 278 base lvl normal mode
[3:01:02] Zyricks: they gave it a npc target cap, use to be uncapped, and lowered the dmg output. So no point to use, unless you're in a farm group
[3:01:06] tkzod: I'm 230
[3:01:07] ChaoticPriest: no shot. I'm like 233 at best LUL
[3:01:08] Mojohusk: Most people jump around Zereth Mortis, no?
[3:01:11] strchsr: @Towelliee 252 in each slot from Zereth Mortis gear, plus 2 291 legendaries would put you at about 257.2 so I guess that is a decent baseline for someone who's casual
[3:01:17] Jokervenom1978: Barrage: When you absolutely, positively have to pull EVERY mob in the instance, accept no substitute.
[3:01:20] SLoPPYALieN: @danielthegathering like green ilvl 262s
[3:01:21] kibarashi: thats steep seeing as you would be in around 120 ish on a fresh 60
[3:01:22] kokochris: pre-patch is gonna drop a bunch of gear..
[3:01:24] Darisen: @Aertharion you can buy full 226 in zereth morthis for anima
[3:01:26] DudeInARobe: @aertharion You can buy 226 gear (greens) in Zerith Mortis with anima
[3:01:29] Felkurio: some people will be going through BFA right into DF though
[3:01:37] Sarocus: @kibarashi This
[3:01:37] htomek: half my chars are in green cause I just used anima and bought zm gear lol
[3:01:43] Alaquane: I thought greens are 226/233?
[3:01:44] lalelusa: won't the pre-patch event equip players properly? used to anyways
[3:01:46] winglessangelsttv: @towelliee when do u think DF will come out. And what are ur thoughts on it so far?
[3:01:48] teatimetox: prob 270
[3:01:50] hiimcusz: Really? I think its way higher :O
[3:01:51] Aertharion: @Darisen oh im aware just dont have the anima to buy
[3:01:55] longdongliam_: are you able to go in the major city yet?
[3:02:01] hiimcusz: 270 is so easily obtainable
[3:02:04] Darwoo: does playing the alpha not ruin the ' new ' excitment for you when it comes out?
[3:02:05] Aquadriel: i think is more closer to 260

[3:03:19] strchsr: @Towelliee I bought some stuff from Glytch Energy and it should be here tomorrow or Thursday so that should be interesting
[3:03:22] Aquadriel: why did i get an ad in spanish KEKW

[3:08:12] Miertez: who would be the guardian then
[3:08:13] Gooseberries: If they kill off Dadgar I'm gone

[3:09:30] Rayao: use besat lore
[3:09:37] strchsr: @Towelliee It might be because it's a quest NPC

[3:55:56] lon3wolv: @Scotty_1977  maybe warriors mages  priests  hunters  do further might get complicated

[4:06:22] warrenny: 2h enhance maybe?
[4:06:32] warrenny: @silkeysmooth Id try it
[4:06:35] TurboedTV: 2h enh would be pog, but it wont ever happen
[4:06:38] 3663Sharad: Me too hoping for a  revival of prot Warrior
[4:06:42] futomara01: 100%
[4:06:43] ArcaneSyntax: no, it'd be awful
[4:06:45] 3663Sharad: longest main

[4:06:45] Mikromanagement: spear was already datamined
[4:06:45] SilkeySmooth: flurry is a specluated talent and thats was always for 2hd
[4:06:48] KraigLooney: I wish elemental would get the ability to tame an elemental like a hunter pet. some of the new elemental models are dope and I want a friend.

[4:07:05] strchsr: @Towelliee Spear was datamined, but god I hope banner isn't back in it's current iteration it's so unfun in PvP to play against
[4:07:15] MedicineMan: Did they release the warrior talent tree yet?
[4:07:15] belaham: BFA prot warrior was good
[4:07:33] MochaMassiah: make having dpear as a warrior make sense. makes no sense just having spear ability
[4:07:34] WSeveryn: blood looks sick, and a possibility.  still need to see Vengeance and Prot paladin
[4:07:44] LesterLinton: not yet @MedicineMan
[4:07:47] lucid_wow: im really excited to see brew and veng
[4:07:57] NexGenHyper: People crying over warriors are the problem lol look at rogues and rets STILL in PVP the Warrior is doing its job utility

[4:08:45] almostdps: 50% exp boost on live apparently
[4:08:46] BlueBeast33: 50% exp buff
[4:08:50] almostdps: maybe they messed up
[4:08:51] Crisis88: You should never base your balancing off the top 5% of a playerbase. It's just foolish
[4:08:53] letdownlarry: hell yeah!!!
[4:08:57] ZonnyArk: I think they updated the wrong version KEKW

[4:10:12] onehitrr: i jumped on for the xp boost. thanks guys
[4:10:14] Gapplebees1: @Crisis88 I kinda disagree, because the top 5% will generally be playing the game as close to max potential as possible which shows what it can or can't do.

[4:27:17] NaoriMMO: @Towelliee What zone are you in today?
[4:27:30] PolyxTV: yeah but isnt laveling quite a bit faster now compared to pre sl so with 50% it'll be even faster

[4:27:39] Crazy__Alex: @thegrt13 oh i see thx

[4:33:42] SurelyBaked: Dracthyr has fixed armor in dragon form though right? which I feel like somewhat differs from the other races unless blizz decides to make their models display equipped armor, but then at that point they’d have to do the same for dracthyr right?

[4:36:02] gritbarontv: to this day, i will not play classic, lol
[4:36:02] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:36:03] Kneckt: @ImSnckPck you know what ur getting into if u play classic lol
[4:36:11] Klarynse: login servers still down
[4:36:13] TheFox0228: @Klatrymadon They give me indigestion are are only good for punting NODDERS
[4:36:17] ImSnckPck: @Kneckt 100%. but retail doesnt need the boost.
[4:36:18] c0mmander_starscream: I think Wrath will be the last classic expansion
[4:36:19] xRezzylol: Dragon riding is gonna make questing so good I think. Compared to being stuck to a ground mount

[4:36:56] gairefear: 50-60 is also doing the ENTIRE story line... I just came back and it's a sad time
[4:37:00] TheFox0228: yeah retail auth servers are buggered right now. I just wanna see my Great Vault no1CRY
[4:37:05] gairefear: I'd rather just 6 hour dungeon then hit content
[4:37:06] srs_business: 10-60 is around 11-12 hours with a good route and experience
[4:37:07] Dezkryn: only people who care about 50% xp buff in pre patch are ppl wanting DKs or going on the Ret train
[4:37:08] Sollice: I hope once Wrath Classic is done, they move the entire Classic team over to Retail. THAT TAKE CLASSIC NERDS
[4:37:13] BlewGamingGroup: until pre-patch hits ... i dont give a shit about bonus xp

[4:37:38] richardmu: Retail server keeps me disconnected for a long time now...
[4:37:39] c0mmander_starscream: oh god the classic turbo's nerds would riot
[4:37:40] Fujin321: They aren't upset Retail got the buff, it's more that Classic players were expecting the Buff around this time frame based on when Blizz announced it and were a little surprised seeing retail get it instead of classic at reset.
[4:37:41] spokesman24: 50% Buff Tomorrow
[4:37:42] gairefear: 6 more on retail, pog
[4:37:44] potatowarrior411: lmfao

[4:38:42] gairefear: What do you think the DF pre patch will be? Hmm
[4:38:47] Dezkryn: every wow channel i go to today its just ppl spamming about this 50% xp buff lol
[4:38:51] PriddyFresh: I really hope after wrath it becomes Classic +. But I think having so much content already made in Cata will be too temping for blizzard.
[4:38:53] xRezzylol: BM is eZ tho
[4:38:59] Crowargus: hunter is god mode for leveling
[4:39:01] ZonnyArk: @xhaven tb then onto wrath. what happens after wrath, dont think many poeple would want cata

[4:43:52] InconCLEAVEable: @Pryorcc they just released a blue post saying it's coming to classic
[4:43:54] chrslp: Blizz generally never gives keys out for WoW Alphas. Its all account flags and you're not likely to get into Alphas unless you're a hardcore beta tester who reports every bug or are a decent size streamer
[4:44:02] Crowargus: dh pls

[4:44:35] Fujin321: @InconCLEAVEable They announced it for Classic awhile ago saying it would release around this time roughly which is where all the confusion is coming from
[4:44:37] DinkytheDoodle: @towelliee you think the joyous journeys buff will go live this week on TBC servers?

[4:46:52] giggz91: is this the new wow action bars?
[4:46:54] Nessebr: wasnt it a legin leggo
[4:46:55] strchsr: @Towelliee I think a lot of these new NPCs just haven't had their IDs flagged as tamable yet
[4:46:55] BigJustin26: do you have the ability to tame cloud serpents from Pandaland?
[4:46:57] ArcaneSyntax: no, its a legoo no
[4:47:00] armidell518815: using the wyrms as pets with sha mount would be Pog
[4:47:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they get the BC Classic EXP buff out today, I'll be happy. If not, they are not getting a like on their tweet.

[4:47:32] TheFox0228: Oh no, did he say "Kil'jaeden must be destroyed" as a voiceline O.o please no Blizz
[4:47:41] cinamonjackz: "Kil'Jaeden must be destroyed" I don't think kalecgos has received the news yet.....
[4:47:43] Shattermare: Does blizz smoke weed?
[4:47:51] conv3rge_: You sure Kalecgos isn't a bronze dragon? This dude livin' 10 years in the past
[4:47:57] Mitune: no he is just senile now LUL
[4:47:57] Narktali: what time is the new build coming out?

[4:53:54] TheGiant99: @towelliee I have Dracdaniels saved on my server
[4:53:55] temp3st98: this is true alpha testing here folk LUL
[4:53:57] Alvari: new music?
[4:54:05] Artiiz: Have they released dungeons on alpha?
[4:54:07] JEM_GG: they better make this a real thing at launch
[4:54:12] Crazy__Alex: LUL
[4:54:16] Ironcladd: chewbakka ftw

[4:54:16] DragonofWolves: This is a youtube playlist Alvari so not yet
[4:54:28] gidgeet: @mulkon Yep authentication servers are having issues
[4:54:30] xendros78: blizz basically caused a ddos on their servers with the xp announcement LUL
[4:54:31] Alvari: @DragonofWolves okey
[4:54:31] YopTV: cant wait for my 278 cube
[4:54:32] DunesGames: is there a new build today?
[4:54:33] TrustyTea: i hope they do
[4:54:34] szble: and it would only be specific mounts
[4:54:39] Teddsan: it all depends how ppl like it at the end of the expansion
[4:54:39] xendros78: good stress for dragonflight though
[4:54:41] CullenPrime: CullenPrime subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months! Waiting for my 3080 to be delivered today!
[4:54:43] plankdemi: I am just waiting for thorghast 2.0
[4:54:43] gairefear: Think with how auctions are merging, server phasing etc. blizzard will eventually combine all servers and shard it out?
[4:54:43] Mecabeast: if they don't add an achievement for the boat ride called let me show you the world ill be dissapointed.
[4:54:44] abracka_: pretty big investment to do it, could see it 10.2.5
[4:55:04] TrustyTea: I hope they take something away from this system, making it like Lost Ark mounts, where each mount has some unique abilities or something, i liked that
[4:55:06] BlewGamingGroup: thats not happening til 11.0
[4:55:07] GeloLlama: Can evokers go to horde and alliance citys?
[4:55:14] strchsr: @Towelliee I like the Dracthyr passive where they get 20% bonus flight speed in zones where you've unlocked the entire map
[4:55:16] Artiiz: If you hover your mount buff in the buff section, what does the tooltip say?
[4:55:23] szble: thats what i meant
[4:55:25] KatieGaming: @gairefear never
[4:55:29] TheFox0228: I mean... I'll probably play an evoker healer so i'll probably not have to worry about that KEKW
[4:55:33] smashwow: it really shouldn't be all mounts just the dragons from DF
[4:55:36] HaloS23: @Towelliee If/when that happens in Azeroth... GG flight paths
[4:55:36] ProfessionalPat: that take a while
[4:55:41] richardmu: just be able to use the dragon mount in old zone
[4:55:43] Artiiz: They would have to re-create a lot of zones so its easier to dragon ride in the zones
[4:55:47] The_Tacozilla: lol theres an Orc in Orgrimmar named "buildtoday" KEKW
[4:55:48] OnceAMoose: Love Rocket at 950%

[4:55:52] egraves7: dragon riding on mim's head Kreygasm
[4:55:54] ZonnyArk: probably on dragons yeah
[4:55:54] infinityarty: not everyone will want to dragon ride every either tho
[4:55:55] Mashiiro98: i think they will probably leave the old mounts without dragon riding. at the very least, its an accessibility issue for some players to ONLY be able to dragon ride
[4:55:55] dreamZ111: dragons = dragon flight
[4:56:01] Tizbit: i think itd be cool if they introduced movement types for each category of mounts and only dragon type mounts ever being able to dragon ride
[4:56:04] Phoenixzn6: KEKW
[4:56:07] J_Walch: they put an xp boost in retail and not classic #despair
[4:56:10] Kneckt: Makes me wonder if its a controller that they can attach the models to but only for certain skeletons atm or something
[4:56:16] Ximora_and_Capy: anyone who was pushing the Slyvanas story should be forced to do that to all the old mounts
[4:56:17] rymerre: the physics momentum system would be strange on most mounts
[4:56:19] Arocian: probably better things to invest that coding into
[4:56:19] abracka_: honestly, i wouldn't be upset with only these dragons to allow us to do dragonriding. just as long as they keep expanding on customization / changing skins / etc to keep it interesting for next xpac after DF
[4:56:20] Kale_Nd: the broom
[4:56:21] 3dRes: Nim doing loop de loops grrrCheer
[4:56:22] BelllGoR: at least increase the flight speed of all mounts lol
[4:56:23] TrustyTea: the tazavesh disk
[4:56:23] strchsr: @Towelliee The Recruit-a-Friend plane would be cool if it had Dragonriding
[4:56:24] Zansteh: the halloween broom
[4:56:25] gairefear: What if old mounts kept base speed, but just gained momentum, so you could afk fly, or active fly for faster?

[4:56:39] Crazy__Alex: Fling Pig
[4:56:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want a dragon riding lil donkey, don't @ me
[4:56:41] Jadziarai: Dragonriding should just co-exist as an option to travel a bit faster than normal riding
[4:56:41] Phoenixzn6: KEKWlaugh
[4:56:41] bonkyouded: fel reaver mount
[4:56:42] OviTheGray: maybe they make demon hunters fly like the dracthyr :)

[4:56:57] BusterDonuts: Hey @Towelliee, not sure if you have any contacts at blizz you could forward this suggestion to:   Update the mount model for Tarecgosa's from the legendary staff from firelands raid? also could we get the ability to use mount without equipping the staff?
[4:56:59] gairefear: It goes to the island

[5:42:59] TheSimpsonsMan: I'm more excited for the expac than any other in years, maybe beacuse Shadowlands didnt do it much for me. Not sure why, maybe just they hype
[5:43:04] kevdot87: I’ve seen logs in SL dungeons
[5:43:15] kevdot87: Kalamazi ran some
[5:43:17] TheSimpsonsMan: TheSimpsonsMan subscribed with Prime. 
[5:43:19] Kneckt: LUL
[5:43:19] andre_scb: my guess 1st week of november release
[5:43:20] RiptoreCA: How many people do you have on "your" team. interested to know the size of the infrastructure of a large streamer
[5:43:21] whuddaa: I'd be surprised if they decide to stick with a 2022 release date
[5:43:26] Malarick: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:43:32] Kneckt: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:43:39] Meakis: Towelliee, wouldn't any release in December be pretty bad seeing how raid release and leveling compared to family holidays ?
[5:43:39] Sollice: I need to know right away when I should take off for the expansion
[5:43:44] Sollice: Going to take a week off
[5:43:47] loulee: @Towelliee me and my company can do that for you (animation for any notification etc. :) )
[5:43:48] RiptoreCA: KEKW
[5:43:49] toobaked1987: I will take the job Towelliee. I have zero experience, but im cheap.
[5:43:51] Meakis: Don't think ppl will be happy with raid release at christmass
[5:44:12] Capo367: I just tuned in, why is there a zoo running over the enemies? LOL
[5:44:15] mavericks312: a day after t-giving
[5:44:20] Meakis: I have exactly the same idea
[5:44:24] jeflag: he knowsss
[5:44:31] Fortuitas: this music Kreygasm
[5:44:33] SLoPPYALieN: @Capo367 There's a STAMPEDE... in your tent!
[5:44:35] Sollice: What does that mean arms race. Does that mean no more BoEs
[5:44:38] Mitune: I wouldnt doubt 3 days at most
[5:44:42] akrus_warr: and they will over think after SoP and its prob gonna be easier than normal
[5:44:49] frazlord: @Sollice making the raid giga hard
[5:44:50] Kasvot_Vaxt: good
[5:44:52] tastytictacs: anything would feel easy after sofo
[5:44:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: No more 300 wipes on a boss LUL
[5:44:55] akrus_warr: SoFO*
[5:44:57] cahoots82: @Sollice Arms race for the last raid was tier gear
[5:44:57] Meakis: @Mitune  7-8 maybe with a reset
[5:45:00] Dinermoe: @Sollice not tuning for RWF
[5:45:00] yardmmada: I love love love the Tuskarr world tour ship
[5:45:04] Cranxjs: give echo a chance to catch up xD
[5:45:13] MaxFel18: Fast wf race and let us have fun with it sodaGun
[5:45:15] TheCakeBadger: I wiped 300 times on Gamon
[5:45:18] BrandonB21: this game wont be coming out this year il bet feet pics on it
[5:45:20] Dinermoe: @Cranxjs no reason. they won 2 times in a row :)
[5:45:27] silodin: We all know evokers will be brokenly OP, just stack the raid and litterly 4 hour mythic clears. you heard it here first
[5:45:30] Kneckt: LUL
[5:45:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: The BoEs are part of the raiding economy, they will stay
[5:45:35] mavericks312: this man said no more boe's lol
[5:45:36] Meakis: "No more BOE's" have you seen what proffesions craft atm ?
[5:45:45] Jereico: The rough thing about the last one for viewership was that the first half of the race was running splits
[5:45:51] crittinkitten: Arms race is in reference to the tuning of the raid guys
[5:45:54] Gotxiko: boe's might be replaces by crafting
[5:45:57] Kasvot_Vaxt: crafted gear should be BiS
[5:46:16] Meakis: Crafting SHOULD replace all of that
[5:46:18] Dinermoe: hell no
[5:46:25] nvnto: @Sollice they mean making raid mechanics so hard u need addons  and weakauras and the cycle of making mechanics more difficult in order to combat weakauras
[5:46:27] mavericks312: @Kasvot_Vaxt eh thats debateable
[5:46:30] Jereico: In Final Fantasy, crafted gear is pre-raid bis, and I like that a lot
[5:46:32] Lowttekk: They mean arms race with addons
[5:46:34] Meakis: Means a great source of income for ANYbody because proffesion
[5:46:49] armidell518815: crafted being pre-bis and on rare occasions bis would be awesome
[5:46:51] yadungoofed101: gonna be a gold heavy expansion for sure
[5:47:01] synedrix: thats new zone or still old one?
[5:47:12] fokeriser: the only reason most people put up with the bs that is mythic raiding is the gear if you make it moot,noone mythic raids
[5:47:33] Xynthos_Gaming: wonder if there will be a black market shop in the new zone
[5:47:38] strike879: ppl asume crafting bis means a full set currently there is already crafted bis with the legendaries
[5:47:40] raye_gaming22: no its about bis stats my man some raid raid is dogshit if it has bad stats
[5:47:40] Gingerprimer: The crafting is more like to fill out slots if you have been very unlucky
[5:47:42] yadungoofed101: it's gonna give CE guilds ways to farm gold in addition to doing sale runs
[5:47:48] Wesley1213: @Towelliee I think we should be able to craft pre mythic raid gear
[5:47:53] Gingerprimer: @Xynthos_Gaming every xp has one so would assume so
[5:47:59] cahoots82: @fokeriser That's not true.
[5:48:02] TheCakeBadger: ú
[5:48:13] TheCakeBadger: oops. sorry
[5:48:26] lokiia: I think that initially crafted gear will be a way to fill in gals
[5:48:26] raye_gaming22: if the raid has only hast mastery boots and haste mastery is bad for you then craftign mythic boots will be your bis
[5:48:29] lokiia: Gaps
[5:48:34] fokeriser: @cahoots82 absolutely true for most people:source 9/10M on 9.2
[5:48:38] kranztheman: the experience gain of 50% paired with the 50% experience gain on world quests is insane.  Im almost lvl 51 and ive only done two bonus objectives.
[5:48:38] rymerre: kinda sounds like a 'whats the point?'
[5:48:46] Jereico: I am personally expecting that system to feel a bit like the catalyst
[5:48:48] fokeriser: not talking about the "pros" that make their money off RWF
[5:48:54] cahoots82: @fokeriser you went 9/10 just for loot?
[5:49:04] RiptoreCA: @kranztheman plus rested XP too?
[5:49:08] Gingerprimer: @chizu_gaming or if you are unlucky and never get your bis gear
[5:49:08] strike879: @towelliee will there be another creation catalyst?
[5:49:09] mohi7o: Is the music from the game?
[5:49:19] ItsGigg: Is this the dragonflight music or do you have something else on?
[5:49:23] fokeriser: @cahoots82 and to see if i could do it,if the loot was irrelevant there's no way i would have bothered though
[5:49:23] Gingerprimer: Most ppl raid for gear 100%
[5:49:29] Dinermoe: @Lmag0055 nope.
[5:49:30] Nerendis: I just can’t wait to craft and make that monies
[5:49:36] Gingerprimer: @ItsGigg no df music his usal wow playlist
[5:49:39] fokoladk: 8 weeks
[5:49:41] Klax99: 8 weeks
[5:49:42] soge131: 8 weeks
[5:49:43] Jereico: God way too long lol
[5:49:45] raye_gaming22: 8  ekekw
[5:49:46] Dinermoe: 2 months
[5:49:48] soge131: 2 full months
[5:49:50] tornbraclet: if the crafting mats from mythic gear a tradable i will have my BS parked in the new town and advertising the gear for 1 mat over what it costs lol
[5:49:50] rymerre: as a pvp'r creation catalyst is a must
[5:49:52] Anton_got_wood: do you like the feel of the hunter? is the talents good?
[5:49:55] MerffTV: five weeks too long
[5:49:56] Kasvot_Vaxt: are the reagents for mythic crafter gear BoP but you can still have a crafter use them for you?
[5:49:59] cahoots82: @fokeriser Sure, the loot being irrelevant would kill it but most people doing mythic raiding aren't doing it for the loot imo, it's for the experience and seeing if they can do it.
[5:50:06] Gingerprimer: @Kasvot_Vaxt yes
[5:50:13] cahoots82: Loot alone isn't enough to get people into mythic raiding. Look at how many people just don't do it.
[5:50:14] Dinermoe: so 4th patch week
[5:50:14] tronbadgames: why time gate it at all?
[5:50:20] Jereico: With the way they gated it with weekly charges, I have no issue with that thing being available immediately
[5:50:28] Kasvot_Vaxt: @Gingerprimer thats pretty good tbh
[5:50:30] SuperLost89: Hello
[5:50:31] Xynthos_Gaming: lol
[5:50:33] ItsGigg: 5 weeks, just long enough to get two months worth of sub out of you PogChamp
[5:50:43] mavericks312: oh boy here come the anti-gaters
[5:50:45] pcwarri0r: just let the degenerates do degenerate stuff and rip it week 1
[5:50:47] bwoods79: think legendaries will come from crafting?
[5:50:53] tronbadgames: @Towelliee makes sense. time gating is just such a lazy solution
[5:50:55] temple117: Why does it matter
[5:51:00] strike879: because mythic raiders have no self controll and will not sleep if there is any power to be gained
[5:51:01] Gingerprimer: @bwoods79 no leggos this expansion
[5:51:09] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Make creating catalyst come out at patch release, but for the first 4 weeks, it costs a token to convert an item, @Towelliee
[5:51:15] temple117: Why arbitrarily gate people that want to nolife the game?
[5:51:18] Dinermoe: @shutupRoman it's not lazy if you keep the highest content relevant in the first weeks
[5:51:18] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:51:21] deathknightmode: have you tried dk ?
[5:51:24] Jereico: Well in 9.2 the catalyst was important for finishing tier sets, especially for classes in your raid that didn't have a lot of personal loot trading
[5:51:26] temple117: It’s creating friction for frictions sake
[5:51:40] Dinermoe: @ArtoriazTV that has nothing to do with the creation catalyst
[5:51:46] Jereico: It's just the bare minimum bad luck protection so people don't feel like garbage
[5:51:48] Dinermoe: @ArtoriazTV you can no life all you want
[5:51:54] tornbraclet: i know on my server all the ore and bars are getting bought up faster than we can stock the AH
[5:52:08] fokeriser: @cahoots82 the first time you clear sure,after that it's just a hassle and a pain especially if the loot isn't good enough to justify it,and you agreed yourself that making the loot non-bis would kill it so not sure why we're arguing
[5:52:22] Boraal: @tornbraclet meanwhile on Steamwheedle nothing is happening.  Can't wait for the updated AH
[5:52:23] mavericks312: i also think they keep the 1 item per week rule with the catalyst as well
[5:52:30] Snabido: BabyRage I want everything now with most little effort
[5:52:37] Dinermoe: ye
[5:52:38] fokeriser: @cahoots82 also about your later point most people just aren't good enough to mythic raid,hell many in my mythic team weren't good enough to be there
[5:52:38] dilweed_: How is BM?
[5:52:38] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[5:52:55] Jereico: It's pretty clear to me that the "mythic reagents" are going to be time-gated in some way lol
[5:53:13] Dinermoe: in what way though
[5:53:17] alucard3zz: how do you like BM hunter @Towelliee ?
[5:53:31] tornbraclet: i just logged in on my bs and picked up 55k from AH
[5:53:36] strike879: its gated in the way you only can loot 8 mythic bosses
[5:53:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: The best materials are going to be gated
[5:53:43] mavericks312: not every player is gonna be able to make mythic gear
[5:53:43] bllynni6614: Hey chat is this the forbidden shore? Just tuned in
[5:53:46] jabsyea: my understanding was raid lockouts would be the gate, right?
[5:53:48] confl1ct10n: So far with what you have seen in the alpha. Does this expansion look better than BFA and SL?
[5:53:48] cahoots82: @fokeriser Fair enough.
[5:53:51] Jereico: @strike879 This is what I mean, for what it's worth
[5:53:53] Checkmatex3: @Towelliee are Warrior talents on this new build?
[5:54:09] Jereico: Like I don't expect you to be able to farm it without restriction
[5:54:12] bllynni6614: Okay ty @Towelliee
[5:54:16] Psyquest: I hope they send some more invites.
[5:54:24] Feint_twiN: Feint_twiN subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[5:55:14] robtest: it always seemed like the guilds had one crafter that got the raid drops
[5:55:19] Terrad0n: I think mythic profession gear is going to be for bad luck protection if you are missing some slots
[5:55:38] brandonshud: I hope we get new talent trees today
[5:55:43] Shuttlelol: yay for us randos
[5:55:43] Velzenx: Chat is new zone launching today’

[5:56:01] Jereico: I don't even play those specs but I'm so hungry for more talent trees
[5:56:03] Nickkoce: a real question here, some one needs to ask. but do you think the servers are ready not just for the flood of players but the players at 700% move speed?
[5:56:03] tornbraclet: i would be ecstatic if i got alpha access but i dont have to have it
[5:56:05] c0mmander_starscream: Randos checking in

[5:56:28] JoJoPhantom: i'm 3.2k io and CE, i know i won't get alpha.
[5:56:32] DigitalChill: fookin newbs
[5:56:33] Audoni: peasents

[5:56:53] cta62: @Towelliee a tad stuck up I see kinda cringe

[5:57:43] tronbadgames: lol
[5:57:49] Jereico: @RiptoreCA The concept art was revealed a while back
[5:57:50] Nickkoce: a real question here, some one needs to ask. but do you think the servers are ready not just for the flood of players but the players at 700% move speed? am looking for an answer or some one to point this out so a dev thinks about this before it drops
[5:57:54] BrandonB21: @shutupRoman lmfao
[5:57:54] Fimbulforge: i think he said kin, not kid
[5:57:55] Moose_Ka: It has to be same house or somethingright>

[5:58:06] Kasvot_Vaxt: i like the new cast bars
[5:58:07] Milanesa_De_Pollo: ToS only says children under 18, @Towelliee , but I doubt Blizzard care that much about family account sharing

[5:59:26] Tgloss22: government looking through it
[5:59:28] Tgloss22: ...
[5:59:30] Nerendis: They would have to ban everyone with 2 accounts to get rid of family sharing. It would be a stupid ass rule.
[5:59:31] BlewGamingGroup: they say kin so they get away from the gender issue
[5:59:33] abracka_: this isn't a movie chat, it's real life
[5:59:49] Tanderstruk: that is what i do whit my wife

[5:59:52] Velashen: Webcam conspiracy theory haha

[5:59:56] EmpathyLiveChat: I wonder if a person's keystrokes can be identified like a signature
[5:59:57] Moose_Ka: Why share an account though? Wouldnt you rather be able to play together
[5:59:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Confl1ct10n Today we are salty that retail got an EXP buff but they are holding out on Classic getting one
[5:59:58] Jomuse92: caught in a laaand sliide
[5:59:59] TheFox0228: that rule is only there because they want more adults behind accounts because of sub revenue anyhow  LUL
[6:00:01] tronbadgames: @Towelliee i just thought you said kiD not kiN.. and was making a joke - chat is going bonkers lol
[6:00:02] Kasvot_Vaxt: VapeNation
[6:00:03] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I imagine Blizzard only cares about account sharing if you are using it to boost people.
[6:00:04] generaljosh721: I have a webcam for work LUL
[6:00:07] lalelusa: wow accounts are probably not shared to the amount netflix accounts are
[6:00:10] Rabiahtaro132: No escape from reality
[6:00:12] ColinHoot: Dragonflight looks incredible, I am surprised it seems so far along in the first alpha
[6:00:16] happyspot: Deep learning to determine different playstyles but why would they ever go through the effort
[6:00:23] ijuki: Wait, live got an exp buff?
[6:00:33] confl1ct10n: @weirdo_dude But they didn’t, they announced it with the start of season 4 which is weeks away
[6:00:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: we got a diablo immortal update post KEKW
[6:00:36] Eviltuna13: Even if you give your account to a friend to play all you have to say is I was over at his house playing
[6:00:38] ijuki: POGGERS ?
[6:00:38] Audoni: that book is a beast
[6:00:54] yepclocc: whens the next alpha phase rolling out? should be this week right?

[6:22:15] DunesGames: survival is not ranged
[6:22:20] CrusaderNero: i've mained my human pala since early BC.. now im not sure. maybe orc hunter or tauren sham in 10.0
[6:22:34] executeru: dead spec then sadly

[6:22:46] floober903: ty
[6:22:52] DunesGames: i think hunter might get some utility coming up
[6:22:53] Jomuse92: @executeru you're a dead spec
[6:22:53] EKS90_: @CrusaderNero I have mained a human pala since vanilla, but in SL now i switched to warrior. cause the paladin i play now its not as fun as it used to be
[6:22:54] DunesGames: for the raid
[6:22:57] Urebaldd: Why is it dead LUL
[6:22:57] Boraal: dead spec?  it's one of the best m+ specs
[6:22:57] aladinsane444: Bm should be meele and surv ranged
[6:23:00] TrustyTea: melee = dead spec LUL
[6:23:10] xraynibba: ????
[6:23:19] TeritoTV: entire expansion? the last tier lol
[6:23:20] ShowDUH: What ? It was trash until Tier set in Sepulcher
[6:23:25] ShowDUH: it was dead the last 2 tiers
[6:23:26] CrusaderNero: @Commander_Eggi same.. something is lost with the pala class
[6:23:35] Wolfenhoof: those huge beautiful tauren BibleThump
[6:23:35] Gillettefuzionz: @executeru you are speaking right out your ass dude
[6:23:37] jumbledjester: are they adding a new bag slot looks like you have a open spot next to your bags
[6:23:38] BigJustin26: Survival Hunter has been the best spec for literally all of Shadowlands lol
[6:23:45] fluffk1n: nightsong BibleThump
[6:23:47] executeru: nah thats not what im talking about, its like, no hunter wants to be a melee hunter
[6:23:50] PvtHudson093: my biggest hope is that Blizz does class tuning more often
[6:23:51] executeru: you do it cause you have to
[6:23:53] Boraal: @jumbledjester it's for reagents/crafting mats
[6:23:59] Lasidor: 1. drop bombs 2. profit
[6:24:02] Day_Walker78: thay should never have done SV  melee class i miss the ranged SV thay totaly destoyed the SV  for me

[6:24:09] jumbledjester: @Boraal ty
[6:24:09] Junebug_VR: Nah I love survival and play it regardless of what the best hunter spec is
[6:24:09] EKS90_: @CrusaderNero Hardest thing for switching for me is all the reps and shit over the years, but starting DF with a new main has gotten me excited.
[6:24:11] Clucky2988: it has been good but people hardly played it, but the people that played it in m+ where spec elite so they usually where super good
[6:24:12] Gillettefuzionz: @executeru That is not true in the slightest
[6:24:15] Cakeabsorber: PogChamp
[6:24:15] Hyelander_: They named it survival hunter because all you do is to survive in Mythics
[6:24:23] gairefear: Stampede is not an option
[6:24:24] tryhardersc: tryhardersc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hunter best class for me. Happy to see some :) happy stampeding
[6:24:24] RadioCreeper: it was good from start in m+ it was contesting in AoE with fire mage in S1 @Towelliee
[6:24:29] jerseyfive: explosiv shot is dope
[6:24:31] Boraal: @Commander_Eggi Ion did say older reps could become account wide in an interview
[6:24:34] ProverbX: it was not bad in m+ but marksman was better+also ranged, the thing that made the spec was teir
[6:24:36] CrusaderNero: @Commander_Eggi yeah thats my idea too... Knowing me, i'll probably play the pala somewhat anyway
[6:24:40] sshadeh: bloody frenzy from BM seems interesting with stampede and other things..
[6:24:49] Urebaldd: I really want to see how m+ is this expac, but guessing that won't be for a while
[6:24:52] sshadeh: dire beasts etc
[6:24:55] EKS90_: @CrusaderNero gonna be an alt, im switching places on the warr and pala xD that is just it
[6:25:03] PlebXL: i watched gingi's bm hunter the other day, it feels like it slaps now.
[6:25:14] EKS90_: @Boraal wait what?! how did i miss this? u remember what interview? I have been pretty okey with looking but guess i missed something.
[6:25:20] Wolfenhoof: I never played anything but BM, but turning a ranged sprec into a melee one was a vile thing to do.
[6:25:26] Eaglebrace: no idea
[6:25:28] cosmoflake: at which time do new builds generally come? 3 PM PT or earlier? @Towelliee
[6:25:33] fluffk1n: i think death is just better overall
[6:25:37] Boraal: @Commander_Eggi I think it was Mr GM
[6:25:38] jerseyfive: its crap in sl
[6:25:39] gairefear: The shack uh rams

[6:25:46] Boraal: no idea on Chakrams sorry man
[6:25:48] Serswipe: its so bad
[6:25:52] Cakeabsorber: @Wolfenhoof It's always had melee components since forever they just focused more on it
[6:25:56] steldam: with the new update yes
[6:25:58] sav37: @Towelliee its fun to use, but isnt top tier
[6:26:04] Celestia6: I've never used it
[6:26:05] SilkeySmooth: 10% to your raptor strike is bad?
[6:26:06] Gillettefuzionz: they said you would always choose death over normal
[6:26:07] DunesGames: Tranq Shot
[6:26:13] CianoHD3: death will be getting a buff to increase all damage taken not just physical
[6:26:13] Subjektive: its bad but they are buffing it for 10% to all damage not just physical
[6:26:14] Day_Walker78: @Eaglebrace Thay should never done it a melee class
[6:26:17] jerseyfive: explosiv shot is great
[6:26:17] ShowDUH: yes
[6:26:20] LoseAlotLuke: its way to late for a new build no? @Towelliee

[6:35:20] Literae: So is Dragonflight the "borrowed" power of this exp? Ofc Tier sets are always borrowed power, but the "main feature borrowed power" etc?
[6:35:33] Hungry_Sultan: how you liking dragonflight chadbomb?
[6:35:51] purpleturtlbacon: Can you use these dragons in non dragonflight zones without the dragonriding feature
[6:35:51] honkblarg: Borrowed FLying
[6:35:54] tronbadgames: @Towelliee is there an ability to "drop" some "waste" on your dragon?
[6:35:56] The_Dane_Train: I know im in the minority, but I wish I could disable the 50% experience buff. Some people enjoy leveling and wish it took longer and was more engaging.
[6:35:57] Fearer2601: would just be sad if they remove it

[6:36:14] cappei: @Towelliee They said they aren't sure if the Dragonriding talents are gonna be account wide. Feel like that's just dumb to not have account wide. Surely they've learned... right?
[6:36:15] TrustyTea: @purpleturtlbacon  not yet, but they might add it in later
[6:36:17] Fimbulforge: I doubt they’d remove it after the expansion

[7:26:11] vision42g: which class you gonna main in df
[7:26:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Preach knows the game better than most of Team 2
[7:26:14] GoKu1g: People should just watch their favorite streamers because they are their favorite streamers, This is why one of your communities is one of the best Towelliee
[7:26:18] coldhandsbeatz: So many people think Preach hates WoW and wants the worst for it lol
[7:26:21] zeitgeiz: He didn’t expect to get it but was still pissed at not getting it
[7:26:23] ArcaneSyntax: max is already doing what Preach did in testing
[7:26:25] Lasidor: When Preach was in it to win it, his WoW takes were always about making it better.
[7:26:26] flebbooo: Whichever way u look at it, Preach made wow content for almost 10 years
[7:26:26] Gezber: Preach has good audience reach... haHAA
[7:26:28] TalesR: alpha servers are off?
[7:26:41] Tizbit: ya @TalesR
[7:26:48] aladinsane444: Preach getting alpha I am ok with. But Pyro? No.
[7:26:57] BigHeroSixy: Its clear no one watched the allcraft preach was on a couple months ago where he pointed at the people looking for his secret accounts LUL and he just played with friends on his main.

[7:27:49] FearedReaper: i dont think there is anything blizzard can do to turn me away from WOW
[7:27:49] iloveyalunn: Thats the community they built though
[7:27:50] AureliusXV: Why does anyone care if some random dude plays a game
[7:27:51] Reap14: Pyro has emotional issues and gets pretty unhinged pretty fast
[7:27:52] Leystra: fr were people that hostile?
[7:27:56] gruntpunch: sounds like an mmo fanbase
[7:27:56] BlueBeast33: MMO tribalism is the worst
[7:27:57] aladinsane444: Pyro literally ripped apart the new wow book on stream. Literal  manchild
[7:27:59] Lasidor: @Reckless_Monk Dude had a straight meltdown lol
[7:28:02] Blackmarsh: communities usally suck, since they dont let you enjoy both games
[7:28:03] Tizbit: @mozavich  he was always saying hed play it forever tho cuz he loves the game. the others were literally saying they wouldnt cover it.
[7:28:04] HeatherJC83: I love @towelliee chat. it's the least annoying wow chat
[7:28:06] mukulukku: @mozavich of course he's got an invite, he has about 50k people watching it
[7:28:08] dehash1: pyro is too far gone
[7:28:27] Wolfenhoof: Well 50% retards is quite good compared to the real life i'd say.
[7:28:27] Gotxiko: yeah "you gotta pick one team, cant play anything else"
[7:28:28] Blackmarsh: I mean I play both WoW and Final Fantasy 14, I enjoy both games
[7:28:31] Mitune: ff14 and Wow are actually great games to play together at the same time
[7:28:33] Biofly28: is alpha offline?
[7:28:38] skOOOOducks: Ya never understood the satisfaction people get from engaging something just to talk shit on it.  Go do something else

[7:29:18] Honvar: now*
[7:29:20] Morpheusx25: hell quin got alpha apparently
[7:29:24] mohi7o: Is the realm on alpha the same for EU and NA?
[7:29:27] Themselves: playing another game = hates wow LUL
[7:29:29] QcSolidRock: and it's because it's objectively a good game
[7:29:31] BigHeroSixy: @toanbao2503 cause shes played WoW for years

[7:29:44] Sluggs_: @havenbirch pyro lost viewers for other reasons
[7:29:51] CCG_337: I pkay both games and yet is so funny hear people takes about both ganes haters know little about the game they play
[7:29:51] ZonnyArk: yea mixing MMOs is a shit show, people care way too much
[7:29:52] QcSolidRock: it has failures but it's still the best game out there
[7:29:53] Dagomarus: so is there gonna be a new build today?
[7:29:54] HeatherJC83: I hope you get mount on first try turn you'll have nothing to do lol
[7:29:58] neo_0098: @towelliee have you ever played FF14?
[7:30:09] BigHeroSixy: My least favorite thing is when you swap games and people ask "did you quit x?"
[7:30:11] BlewGamingGroup: thats why he has multiple stream channels
[7:30:11] Morpheusx25: @CasualCarvalho same
[7:30:12] Broomba: @neo_0098 since 2013
[7:30:12] sponx: I can never get why people can't just let others enjoy something they might not enjoy without crying about it LUL
[7:30:13] flebbooo: It was awful whenever he tried to come back to FF this time, his reddit was something LUL
[7:30:17] BBeasten: !addons

[7:30:17] Utmost777: FFXIV community isn't toxic, until you put them in the same room as the WoW community
[7:30:19] Wolfenhoof: If i where asmon i would stream with chat turned off.
[7:30:21] Subjektive: is it a FF community being crazy or WoW's or both?
[7:30:21] Thoreya: He wouldn’t even play FF if his chat wasn’t so fucking annoying about it prob LUL
[7:30:22] Lasidor: @Towelliee Preachs takes on WoW were ALWAYS about making the game better, even if it was more for the raiding standpoint and lets be fair, a lot of his criticisms were fixed in later patches in multiple xpacs.
[7:30:22] Blackmarsh: just let people play what they enjoy, who the fuck cares.. play what you enjoy, that easy
[7:30:25] 1llum1n471: 1llum1n471 subscribed with Prime.

[7:30:49] Broomba: but @towelliee respects FF14
[7:30:54] SurelyBaked: Obsessive behavior has just created a lot of toxic pockets in the gaming community unfortunately and thats all channeled towards creators who display the content
[7:30:55] FearedReaper: because we love you
[7:30:58] DJayyinc: DJayyinc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Alpha servers down?
[7:31:04] BigHeroSixy: I respect that. With the way they do patch releases end of expac has all the goods to see so it makes sense.
[7:31:06] Arbszy: Yes alpha down
[7:31:06] Subjektive: i dont like FF but i dont trash the game
[7:31:10] aladinsane444: Even AnnieFuschia had to take brake from msq because the ff andies were too much
[7:31:11] blascotwitch: I hate FF but i don't need to post bad thinks because FF is popular now its so dumb
[7:31:12] Purplestuff1: that was the bait
[7:31:12] BlueBeast33: I thought you wanted to try FF14 raiding
[7:31:12] Heaay: WoW is life
[7:31:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Savix has been back in WoW some lately, and it's awkward for him, too
[7:31:21] chrissykes78: who care what you are  playing, the most important thing is you have fun!
[7:31:22] aresden3: hey guys i have no idea about wow. are people playing retail or classic?
[7:31:22] FearedReaper: WOW or nothing
[7:31:26] egraves7: and a lot of ff andies treat it like a religion
[7:31:32] QcSolidRock: I tried FF and the combat sucked. Just too many skills and combos it's just confusing and annoying to play

[7:31:38] htomek: they're fucking annoying
[7:31:41] zgag: I'm guessing the Alpha servers are down
[7:31:42] Wolfenhoof: @Subjektive If you like FF its way more pleasant, welcoming and helpful, but if you critizes it, they fuck you, kill you and eat you and maybe not in that order.
[7:31:46] Reckless_Monk: yea poor annie getting aggro from the ff bunniegirl fans
[7:31:46] BigHeroSixy: If you ask anyone who has gone through the msq and came from another game you will find they had issues. Esfand has said the same.
[7:31:47] jolehin: @QcSolidRock Its also janky as hell
[7:31:51] trailerparkkgamer: its creepy
[7:31:52] Zapp_Brannigan86: @Towelliee You done playing wotlk beta? or is it down for a bit?
[7:31:56] BigHeroSixy: and esfand is just on HW
[7:31:59] Lasidor: I havent really liked FF since FF6, but Im an old ass boomer so...

[7:32:41] Luxicake: make me a sammich woman!
[7:32:43] Lamyth: I'm planning to go back to wow in dragonflight purely because I find the FF combat to slow LUL

[7:33:04] NickLeonhearth: what does MSQ stand for?
[7:33:05] BoiAtomico: FF XIV fan base is like that sweet girlfriend that looks like a great housewife but ends up being a deranged psychopath if you say the wrong thing KEKW
[7:33:17] Mitune: Main story quest = MSQ
[7:33:23] SurelyBaked: @nickleonhearth main scenario/story quest
[7:33:24] flebbooo: FF community is nice to u if u give your soul to their game in return KEKW
[7:33:29] NickLeonhearth: thx
[7:33:33] Verdell263: I found skipping the cutscenes made the MSQ better.....but you can't say that out loud to FF people
[7:33:47] Aidler: Lost Ark is definitely another one of the games with a dedicated aggressive community
[7:33:47] Nowaayjose: Panda has super secret alpha keys tho
[7:33:50] Broomba: what towelliee isnt is Quinn in FF14
[7:33:52] egraves7: and you better react to the MSQ exactly how i want you to
[7:33:53] neo_0098: So youre basically not playing patches but iust the Expansions Main Story quest?
[7:33:56] Dvalin: why are we doing this boss Mr. Towelliee?
[7:33:59] Wolfenhoof: The crafting and housing to wow and i would be the happiest old tauren around.

[7:34:22] duffluv22: August 2
[7:34:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shado-Pan coming soon LUL
[7:34:29] mitchtheprodigy: hi towelliee, for someone who has only pvped for years, whats the best route to get into pve
[7:34:31] SurelyBaked: It’s weird because I’ve always been a fan of the FF franchise, and have played WoW since wrath, but I can’t even relate the two games. I don’t know why people force them to be related just because they are MMOs
[7:34:36] raye_gaming22: i have to farm 8 items from mechagon ill live there kekw
[7:34:37] Onearmyof2: just make sure you do a key before hand to get atleast a 15 for season 4
[7:34:40] smashwow: kara is fine, Grim Rail Depot can fuck itself.
[7:34:53] zgag: @Towelliee Have you checked out Max's raid value for the current alpha classes/specs
[7:34:54] Jereico: That sounds good to me lol
[7:35:14] Nuerologicz: im uininstalling all my games when wrath comes out lol

[7:35:24] smashwow: tier list kinda. more like a here's why they'll take what they take @Towelliee
[7:35:24] BrandonB21: is the build out yet?
[7:35:25] feels____: its work in progress
[7:35:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know if they can do tier lists yet, the trees are changing
[7:35:29] zgag: He got a whole spread sheet going
[7:35:30] Vendralos: and balancing is not even close to done yet xD
[7:35:30] Nightmareo: its like rankings on how valuable they are
[7:35:30] FostBros: ya its like raid buffs and what each class brings
[7:35:38] Shrenko: alpha tier lists ResidentSleeper
[7:35:41] Banjo586: KEKW
[7:35:41] Xoyzor: @Towelliee but we already know taht ret and feral will be on the bottom of dps meters as they always are
[7:35:42] Aidler: Look at the OG Towelliee yt videos. He wasn't always this calm and controlled..   lol
[7:35:54] mavericks312: it doesnt suprise me that max is starting his prep for the next raid
[7:35:55] Shrenko: towCopium
[7:36:00] Colt_Engineer: but what about solid?
[7:36:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[7:36:09] smashwow: yeah we all know Echo was looking into DF back in BFA so Liquid better click up quick Kappa
[7:36:18] KingSpud91: then global release for raid? :)
[7:36:20] Jack_the_Dipper: With a chance of no more boss mods
[7:36:21] Cyony: If there is ANYONE that actually has a good reason to make that shit, it would be world first raiders. Yeah, it's kinda pointless for most others though
[7:36:23] michaelkn: Feel like Preach also went a bit too much into wow hate instead of wow criticism at one point - so he probably appealed a lot to the more toxic FF players
[7:36:24] dawgystyle_13: as long as they don't Simone Biles again  :-(
[7:36:25] WestonTeli: less system grinds = more competition
[7:36:25] Hyelander_: Final Fantasy plyers are like clingy ex girlfriends. Cant get over streamers who left
[7:36:41] Chuckforfun: Global Release?! Eu wins!
[7:36:48] BlueBeast33: One of Echo's main healers just quit WoW too

[7:36:58] mavericks312: @Chuckforfun wrong global release china wins
[7:36:59] Avalan09: But no one seemed to care when EU ran the table lol
[7:37:07] Xynthos_Gaming: lol
[7:37:08] stresstest: Theres no Race to First for Season 4 right ?
[7:37:08] Morpheusx25: china#1

[7:37:19] Chiphazzord: china just steals strats though
[7:37:22] fokeriser: rwf Bedge
[7:37:22] Hyelander_: China will beat the game in grey gear
[7:37:24] mitchumtx: @stresstest nah
[7:37:25] Wolfenhoof: Chinas players don't sleep or eat.
[7:37:25] FostBros: china are the real gamers
[7:37:25] mohi7o: china is scary monkaS
[7:37:27] ripripripripripriprip: no eu players are the best

[7:37:30] redbulladin: ops
[7:37:30] Brodih_: toilet chairs
[7:37:31] BoiAtomico: there's no reason for a global reset day to be a bad thing
[7:37:34] Shuttlelol: they dont sleep because they have 50 people on roster playing 20 toons
[7:37:36] Shuttlelol: LULW
[7:37:36] kreff_: @Chiphazzord everyone does
[7:37:36] ely_ely: thats no race, thats a blitzkrieg
[7:37:37] MindhackerTV: if u want a real release just atribute the title for the number of hours from release to completion...
[7:37:43] sponx: Antarctica players best racers 100%
[7:37:46] redbulladin: they should count it when the raid go live from that point and then its world first when you kill it during the time
[7:37:52] nikkep01: Or, just have a timer for each guild when they first enter the raid
[7:37:58] kreff_: @ely_ely is that the reference that I think it is? :D
[7:38:00] nikkep01: Like a race, best time wins
[7:38:03] raye_gaming22: the chinese account sharing and runnig m+ 24/7 they need a ban tahts waht they need
[7:38:07] Arbszy: Global Reset will not happen the amounnt of work needed is not worth it.
[7:38:09] Utmost777: or they would have to put it on a tournament realm
[7:38:17] Aidler: I don't known about China. Lately they never satisfied expectations
[7:38:17] sinlesssinner: limit will win every raid from now on... Blizzard are going to make ez raids a la Xavius... sad day my friends
[7:38:21] ely_ely: @kreff_ idk :P
[7:38:22] Kloshx: problem is timezones, if you do global u have to fuck someone and reset it like... at 4pm...
[7:38:37] kpo887: Global race to first really does not matter for 99.99999% of players
[7:38:37] Arbszy: EU needs to stop crying about headstart they won for years and now complain. sore losers.
[7:38:38] lithium364: also the EU workers having to work nighttime
[7:38:47] Kasvot_Vaxt: good RWF shouldn't even be a consideration
[7:38:48] TheSimpsonsMan: Probably asked 100000 times but what is that XP addon you use? It looks amazing
[7:38:48] dawgystyle_13: they could always just "AGREE" to starting on Friday and stop Mon, then back up again on Friday. lol
[7:38:54] Honvar: @Arbszy Ok. :)
[7:38:55] rick_morks: Eu still wins so it is allright
[7:38:59] smashwow: it about to be EU v EU if method keep up that grind
[7:39:02] Gotxiko: wed resets on EU really suck, new patches get spoiled
[7:39:13] mitchumtx: @Arbszy Amen @Arbszy
[7:39:15] itsNODDERS: did you took a look at the leaked raid footage?
[7:39:26] Rexialiton: @Arbszy towStop towIt KEKW
[7:39:31] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee limit won when the final boss was underwhelming.. if the bosses are ez, Echo has no chance
[7:39:32] SurelyBaked: I mean blizz has inconvenienced all raiders by making their raids hard because they want a competitive gaming presence. So many guilds rotted this xpac and it isn’t JUST bc of the ridiculous timegating
[7:39:37] zaphirox1: hello
[7:39:43] itsNODDERS: yeah might be it, not sure
[7:39:47] Ponickz: The race should be played on a torney realm where all teams have fair access to
[7:39:53] raye_gaming22: cuz they have 1 day adv ofc htey win in a 1 lockout raid
[7:39:54] Chiphazzord: nazoth was ez? really
[7:40:08] duffluv22: If they're all sponsored..why not bring the rwf players to the US??? Makes it fair.
[7:40:09] lithium364: good decision
[7:40:14] Aidler: US is sprint, EU is endurance, China is mega endurance
[7:40:17] Jack_the_Dipper: Do you think that boss mods and some of the WA functions will be removed in Dragonflight? @Towelliee
[7:40:20] Reckless_Monk: lol Sire was easy..hmmm..
[7:40:22] Mitune: thats why I say 3 to 4 days
[7:40:23] ripripripripripriprip: i wonder why eu players are so much more skilled then na
[7:40:25] Reckless_Monk: no shot
[7:40:29] SurelyBaked: The competitive guilds just need to get over themselves or get gud lol. The game shouldn’t be tailored to them
[7:40:29] Jereico: Making a raid easier than last tier could just as well mean going back to "usual"
[7:40:29] cruzeal: i hope it's over in 5 days
[7:40:32] Colt_Engineer: hard gigity
[7:40:33] Jereico: Last tier was a huge outlier
[7:40:33] Furinax: I like it how it was in Legion.
[7:40:37] Psychedelicxy: Please guy´s everyone should read this book <<Ami:Child of the Stars>>

[7:40:54] DeleldurTV: Like the buff in ICC?
[7:41:17] Mitune: yes to the ic thing
[7:41:22] Mitune: icc*
[7:41:25] VHFrey: I think first month or two of mythic should be bleeding edge raiders clearing it, then add a buff like ICC.
[7:41:29] SurelyBaked: It’s called the world of Warcraft not the world of competitive gaming LUL
[7:41:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: A stacking raid buff is probably easier to implement than nerfing it 20 times
[7:41:45] DeleldurTV: 30%
[7:41:54] Jack_the_Dipper: Do you think that boss addons and some of the WA functions will be restricted in Dragonflight? @Towelliee
[7:41:58] TheSimpsonsMan: Does anyone know the name of the addon that shows his XP, it looks great!
[7:42:15] Saftmax: what is that smoke device and why do you use it?
[7:42:24] DeleldurTV: i think its a WA for the xp bar if im not misstaken
[7:42:29] readyvic: classic bluepost lol see you in a few weeks about that buff
[7:42:29] Ertra: @TheSimpsonsMan thats luxthos weak aura for the xpbar
[7:42:30] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee help a brother out, got a question for ya, is the gear from season 4 useable in the tier catalyst thingy?
[7:42:31] rosina_scarlett: @Saftmax you mean his vape?
[7:42:32] Yagr6: does that reset each week?
[7:42:37] raye_gaming22: it was weekly like the icc buff but as a trait
[7:42:38] TheSimpsonsMan: Thank you
[7:42:47] chubahi: @TheSimpsonsMan  i whisper u the WA
[7:42:50] chubahi: link*
[7:42:51] flebbooo: @sinlesssinner should be
[7:42:53] dym_jt: @Saftmax it's a vape, test good, may contain nioctine, so can be addictive.
[7:43:04] Zapp_Brannigan86: Are you done with the wotlk beta for now?
[7:43:07] Yagr6: "quite frankly thats a skill issue"
[7:43:09] BigHeroSixy: My favorite part was when you mentioned monastery to ion KEKW
[7:43:12] NVbrutal: frankly thats a skill issue.
[7:43:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: "get good" is pretty much never a good answer
[7:43:16] Neutrum00: Btw @Towelliee , the OW update was just a new Mercy skin
[7:43:24] chubahi: @TheSimpsonsMan  whispered u the wago link in twtich
[7:43:27] newkingcody: GIT GUD KEKW
[7:43:45] kreff_: @Towelliee I laughed hard at "we would never do that" and Ion's reaction LUL
[7:43:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: And 200 potions
[7:43:56] raye_gaming22: hes not wrong if some one can clear the raid and i dont its a skill issue
[7:43:57] yzino1992: 1 extra talent point per month while inside raid!
[7:43:59] Psynarius: no phase 2 yet?
[7:44:04] NetherRegion: @Towelliee did you watch the Derek Jeter Documentary?
[7:44:07] mavericks312: get good son lol
[7:44:28] Goodson89: ?
[7:44:36] Tanderstruk: sounds great

[10:01:28] BlewGamingGroup: @Towelliee thats why wrath was so alt friendly  .. cause the content was so easy
[10:01:30] BigJustin26: Cataclysm however couldn't be called Classic anymore because of the landscape changes
[10:01:32] dym_jt: WotLk was my first expansion, so back then I was new to the game, knew nothing.
[10:01:34] Ispintowin: wrath is when i got my first maxed character which was a dk and i farmed dungeons as a DK tank :)
[10:01:35] druidhex: <--- dope started in wrath
[10:01:39] Coriollis: rushing to do Ulduar hard modes was pretty taugh thou , especialy firefighter and 0 lights
[10:01:48] Luxicake: :O i want af lower bracelet transmog!
[10:01:48] Joryckfree: well at least in eastern europe we are 5 years back always so we were still learning in wrath how the f do u play the game :D
[10:02:03] deffomythicraider: i think the advancements of weakauras changed wow the most because they had to change everything to accommodate
[10:02:10] Edorasthegamer: If anyone wants to know what GDKP is here you go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiXr4XQkHk

[10:02:22] brian_777777777: and then the ICC buff
[10:02:40] RomeoMiike: RomeoMiike subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[10:02:44] druidhex: I didnt understand spell pen and hit rating back in those days
[10:02:45] brian_777777777: trial of the crusader got a big nerf too the week before i think
[10:02:48] BlewGamingGroup: hard modes = the original mythic plus
[10:02:53] Vondrex: One would think every expac should be like that
[10:03:10] MasterNeff: They will add LFD at some point i guarantee it
[10:03:11] toobaked1987: LFD will be implemented 3 months into Wrath launch
[10:03:26] lordmyer: I hope they add LFD
[10:03:35] blitzflay: toc was not to bad
[10:03:45] classicfluffy: its so funny how ppl said LFD was the worst that happened to the game, now ppl cry about it they want it
[10:03:56] Utmost777: I enjoyed ToC
[10:03:57] dragothicx: ToC had some dope looking tier sets and gear Kreygasm
[10:03:59] Thunder4o: @hyperblitz415 toc was one more the worst raids ever
[10:04:07] Coriollis: toc made half my guild leave the game after Ulduar hard modes
[10:04:17] dragothicx: Horde Bias but anyway KEKW
[10:04:20] Luxicake: #NoChanges...ExceptThisOne!
[10:04:32] Nalleys: KEKW
[10:04:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: even if LFD is there you can always choose to not use it, so why not have it
[10:04:41] blitzflay: @Thunder4o well everyone with their oppinions
[10:04:42] XshadowturkeyX: LFD came in patch 3.3 if its not in wrath at sumpoint then its not true wrath classic
[10:04:43] ehweron: cause it's not the same community anymore. those no-changers either stayed in vanilla or quit after what Blizz did to TBC
[10:04:44] BitsyOD: did twitch just advertise gambling  then genshin impact immediately after to me
[10:04:54] Shrenko: what does LFD stand for ?
[10:04:56] aztech200: do the hero achievements go away with season 4?
[10:05:00] baZleicious: I loved the optional hard modes. I remember killing the heart of XT-002 to activate it
[10:05:09] cates: @xshadowturkeyx lol “true wrath classic” who cares man.
[10:05:14] Keirmot: #OnlyTheChangesIWant
[10:05:17] baZleicious: Ulduar was top tier raiding
[10:05:17] Civiius: I remember back in the day people complaining about LFD when it first released KEKW
[10:05:25] Shaqtal888: @Shrenko dunno if it's meme or not but it's looking for dungeon
[10:05:28] Kyrrua: LFD was the worst tthing at the time, but we didn't realize players were far worse today. DarkMode
[10:05:30] SurelyBaked: OMEGALUL
[10:05:32] Ispintowin: are they inviting people who pre-order the epic edition of DF @Towelliee ?
[10:05:33] Arbszy: LFD came out in last patch anyway.
[10:05:34] Zivs: @aztech200 which hero achivement?
[10:05:35] Edorasthegamer: @Shrenko looking for Dungeon
[10:05:41] XshadowturkeyX: yeah i could of used better worlding thats all on me
[10:05:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: a true classic wrath wouldnt let you make a dk during the prepatch
[10:05:49] mavericks312: as if wrath was even hard back in the day
[10:05:50] SurelyBaked: ^
[10:05:52] toobaked1987: Naxx was cleared by any major guild the NIGHT it launched. Wrath was a total joke, so casual it hurt.
[10:05:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: i leveled that shit from launch back in the day
[10:05:59] Verdell263: "Back in my day"....
[10:06:07] aztech200: @Zivs the ones for the SL dungeons
[10:06:12] mozavich: @mavericks312 heroic lich king was, hardmode mimiron was
[10:06:26] Coriollis: arcane dream in ICC Kreygasm
[10:06:33] druidhex: deepfreeze shatter combos...
[10:06:39] classicfluffy: @mavericks312 because people were shit back then
[10:06:42] Zivs: @aztech200 ah, they won't go away but scaling will go up so you will need better gear which we will get, etc
[10:07:07] Zivs: @aztech200 oh actually they probably are since they are removed from the dungeon pool
[10:07:12] Velashen: I think classic should have been changed. Its all is so easy because every version has been on the last patch when everything is mega buffed. It’s just stupid.
[10:07:18] PhoenixVirusTV: true
[10:07:25] toobaked1987: During Classic and TBC people were clicking a large portion of their abilities. You'll never get your nostalgia back, move on.
[10:07:26] SurelyBaked: oof, ulduar is based
[10:07:28] Zeradicated: Ulduar was truly savior of WoTLK early
[10:07:34] mavericks312: @mozavich thats debatable
[10:07:35] Coriollis: oh yeah there was a big break between Sartharion and Ulduar
[10:07:41] Kittastrophe: trail was a casual fan service
[10:07:41] classicfluffy: @Velashen no, because every fucking expansion is min maxed into oblivion
[10:07:43] Austei: 1st boss in ulduar i hated so much
[10:07:48] NinjaChane: absolutely correct
[10:07:48] lokiia: Ulduar was what got me into hardcore raiding
[10:07:50] Zeradicated: Phase 1 lasted for so long. We had so many people quitting.
[10:07:57] thatguynamedjans: For my 14 year old pug raid leading self, naxx was hard lol.
[10:07:57] Arbszy: That is what I did, I unsubbed and played Warhammer Online until ToC came out.
[10:07:57] executeru: HM flame leviathan is hard AF for those who think wotlk is a joke
[10:07:58] mozavich: @mavericks312 it's not a debate. it is facts.
[10:07:59] druidhex: There was the aregent tourney
[10:08:00] Arbszy: I missed Ulduar
[10:08:02] gidgeet: Ulduar was pretty good raid, loved it
[10:08:03] classicfluffy: @Velashen look at classic, no dps warrior back then was wearing leather because it was better
[10:08:04] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[10:08:05] Velashen: @classicfluffy it would be either way.
[10:08:18] gidgeet: hated ICC raid, but at least we finally killed the whiny arthas lol
[10:08:18] Austei: i remember solo healing naxx 25 at one point on pally.
[10:08:19] BlueBeast33: Wrath was great for alt play though
[10:08:20] Eradicator87: vehicle combat oof
[10:08:22] Verdell263: I took a break for 3 months after release and my guild was still running Naxx lol
[10:08:24] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee and some ppl still didnt understand Thaddius after 6 months
[10:08:28] lokiia: Ulduar hardmodes were so much fun to do
[10:08:28] Leyu93: imagine having done naxx in classic and then again for 5.5 months in wotlk
[10:08:32] Kittastrophe: damn toweliee you're still in the dj chat from ages ago
[10:08:34] Onearmyof2: ruby sanctum lol
[10:08:38] NinjaChane: think of the raids in Lich King anyways.  I think for the most part they are weak without Ulduar
[10:08:43] BigJustin26: malygos hype
[10:08:53] dragothicx: Sarth3D Pog
[10:08:54] lokiia: Sarth 3D!
[10:09:02] Kittastrophe: left overs ya
[10:09:05] nitroe: What are you going to main in dragonflight towellie?
[10:09:11] lordmyer: @Leyu93 I know people that wanted more time for Naxx in classic KEKW
[10:09:14] BlueBeast33: Dragonflight needs something like Sarth 3D
[10:09:14] lokiia: We had a fully fire resited bear Druid to tank 3d
[10:09:17] love_eggplant: @nitroe paladin
[10:09:23] thatguynamedjans: See I remember lots of people sturggling with naxx in wrath, bad internet became a raid killer with heigan
[10:09:30] Coriollis: I wonder if they will release Ulduar un nerfed , especialy for Ignis and Hodir evan Vezax
[10:09:40] Leyu93: @lordmyer well there are also flat-earthers
[10:10:05] druidhex: i never perfected the safety dance.. too much lag in the internet back in those old days
[10:10:07] strchsr: @Towelliee Just got Alpha, Friends and Family is lit
[10:10:12] Joryckfree: when I was playing original wotlk I tried naxx once and I hated the design and everything there so I just didnt raid the first season LUL
[10:10:18] classicfluffy: they also said that in classic tho, bwl less than 2h first clear :D
[10:10:20] thatguynamedjans: New mechanics too, numbers increase wont make it that much harder id imagine
[10:10:21] Verdell263: But #nochanges
[10:10:23] toobaked1987: Naxx if you sneezed right the bosses died. It was a total joke
[10:10:47] Coriollis: lol , yeah priest was the king
[10:10:56] love_eggplant: because you are talented

[10:50:38] OGTigolebitties: I don’t think you’d get banned
[10:50:47] metavahn231: this the first sign of the delay?
[10:51:01] kiroslays: F the chat man
[10:51:04] opaldiia: I miss Preach
[10:51:04] Herzenliegen: Awww man I have to work so I'm going to miss it
[10:51:05] luckfore: everytime preach says something positive about the alpha his chat will mald
[10:51:07] egraves7: his chat is gonna mald tf out
[10:51:10] BoiAtomico: imagine preach streaming WoW Alpha and the chat going bonkers with no XIV gameplay and shit
[10:51:12] strchsr: @Towelliee I'm about to skip raid tonight in 2.5 hours if the servers are up lol
[10:51:12] dragothicx: Doesn't he have some XIV extremes to do DansGame

[10:51:26] TheCakeBadger: asmonPray
[10:51:27] Fyeah: but i thought FFXIV ppl are not toxic
[10:51:42] Astrega: knowing preach he'll just trashtalk the alpha for no reason
[10:51:44] Reap14: The WoW community is no better and has literally zero room to talk
[10:51:51] LunarSoulReaper1: good evening all
[10:51:54] BlewGamingGroup: lynch mob inc
[10:51:56] kiroslays: To much dancing in that game!
[10:51:57] metavahn231: dude doesnt even play games anymore, 7 hours of react
[10:51:59] jamechro: People on the internet suck, it is what it is
[10:51:59] Morpheusx25: @Colt_Engineer na his fellow neckbeards
[10:51:59] SurelyBaked: KEKW
[10:52:02] dracullus: they will watch him like shithawks
[10:52:03] Nachozdood: FF14 community is extra toxic if you dont 100% agree with them
[10:52:03] luckfore: weeb detected :O
[10:52:05] zgag: Everyone thought that only Wow had toxic players.  lol.  FF has just as much if not more
[10:52:07] Funderik: preach may just wish he never touched ff14 after the storm hits when he logs in wow.
[10:52:09] CardinalTX: FF player detected
[10:52:10] Colt_Engineer: @Colt_Engineer a men
[10:52:14] Nebulizer87: the wow community is awful but we acknowledge we're terrible

[10:52:43] abracka_: THANK YOU
[10:52:45] opaldiia: absolutely agreed
[10:52:46] Artivicii: LMAO TRUE
[10:52:50] Funderik: not totally correct
[10:52:51] jamechro: That's a big true
[10:52:51] Colt_Engineer: BIG FACTS
[10:52:51] Fyeah: makes sense yeah
[10:52:52] Artivicii: HAHAHA SO TRUE
[10:52:53] XshadowturkeyX: makes sense
[10:52:55] solsaver12: Just shows people are messed up
[10:52:55] opaldiia: asmon's chat is full of them
[10:52:55] Tayve_: actually true
[10:52:56] Syrupup: nailed it
[10:52:57] OGTigolebitties: I used to like watching asmon but something happened, he’s cocky and makes very ignorant comments now
[10:52:58] Lloydbanksz: BARS!
[10:52:59] Reap14: I stopped playing WoW over 10 years ago and don't hate it at all. It just isn't on my radar anymore.
[10:52:59] opaldiia: its horrible
[10:53:05] andrejhmm: TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[10:53:09] Coriollis: people need validation xD
[10:53:10] Rodorann: i couldnt get into FF
[10:53:10] snake_like: so still WoW players at the end of the day lmao
[10:53:11] dragothicx: clipped and shipped Kappa
[10:53:11] Arbszy: Yes
[10:53:12] Herzenliegen: 100% true
[10:53:13] Syrupup: spitting
[10:53:13] metavahn231: those people literally hate the games they actually play
[10:53:14] Nebulizer87: i'm in an odd boat that i love ESO GW2 WoW FFXIV Lost Ark and only wish i had more time to play them all
[10:53:16] CCG_337: no lies detected, agree
[10:53:17] Noshpan: Towelliee here spittin facts
[10:53:20] Austei: wow community been great last couple years from what i have experienced
[10:53:24] Tayve_: people who don't know it's okay to enjoy more than one game.
[10:53:27] Nachozdood: WoW VS FF14 is just as bad as PoE VS Diablo
[10:53:27] Venasmat: I love both games FF14 and WoW though :D
[10:53:29] Anura_Rhel: Tbh I left WoW to play XIV, still do and I think DF looks pretty decent
[10:53:30] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[10:53:41] Rodorann: yikes
[10:53:43] snake_like: MY GAME IS SUPERIOR. AGREE OR BE RATIO'D
[10:53:44] jamechro: I'm so glad I don't feel "tribal" about what video games I play lmao
[10:53:44] velathore: Lets narrow it down a bit more.  Its a bunch of mid 30 something11 neckbeards raging.
[10:53:47] metavahn231: sound like content locusts
[10:53:48] Noshpan: @Towelliee And, often times, they're just as toxic IN FFXIV
[10:53:59] CardinalTX: @Nebulizer87 im in that boat!   keep em all updated and play them
[10:53:59] cajunw33dh3ad: I can name a streamer but that’s gonna make him a target
[10:53:59] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[10:54:02] mavericks312: thats why asmon stopped playing it
[10:54:18] solsaver12: geez streamers should and do play whatever they want, not because their fan base or viewers tell them.
[10:54:19] jetributions: ugh this is aweful. i just wanna do a dungeon
[10:54:23] opaldiia: asmon played FF like two weeks ago and his chat was insane
[10:54:30] Nebulizer87: @SixFourBoom yup im on my skyscale journey on gw2 atm :)
[10:54:34] opaldiia: like people do not let that man liev
[10:54:36] opaldiia: live*
[10:54:43] tripl3heart: asmonFiend asmonFiend asmonFiend asmonFiend
[10:54:45] metavahn231: he cant fit in games with his 6 hour react content
[10:54:45] zgag: When you look at shear numbers Wow still has a larger player base, but not everyone from that large player base is playing Wow.  With FF the player base isn't as large does have more of an active base.
[10:54:46] isseidahk: hes taken a few days off, been farming mounts on zackrawr
[10:54:52] Lasidor: Regardless of your opinion of how or why Preach left, the man knows WoW better than roughly 90% of the playerbase.  If his opinion is swayed and shows positivity it will bring back many players.  Blizz played the right card here.
[10:54:52] SurelyBaked: i think he's trying to save all MSQ for main stream, he's just been taking a break I think
[10:54:53] luckfore: he mainly plays wow on that channel
[10:54:55] blossomcamm: annie the same way she stopped playing ff not as much
[10:55:03] zgag: but *
[10:55:07] opaldiia: @luckfore and people get mad when they see him playing lol
[10:55:16] snake_like: stop with the personal attacks moon2FAT
[10:55:19] d1ylor1: bro I watched u once in like 4 months , and I opened the stream today and u still farming the same mount wtf
[10:55:41] jamechro: All the decent people are chilling and enjoying it lol
[10:55:43] jaalexba: @d1ylor1 go ape shit
[10:55:50] CardinalTX: @Nebulizer87 Ive found over time that i have more fun just playing what i feel at the time.  Dont worry about keeping up. currently on SWtOR
[10:55:51] xluckydawgx: Mods, ban errbody
[10:55:52] unholyshiz: True that was what happened with me when asmon was playing ff14
[10:55:52] Pixidyr: its just people being petty isnt ??
[10:55:55] Artivicii: @luckfore lmao nice name
[10:55:55] zgag: I remember back in the day when you played Rift often.
[10:55:58] jkitchin75: @d1ylor1 cos he has not got it yet easy
[10:56:00] Noshpan: I love FFXIV. I still love WoW, ESO, GW2 & both EverQuests
[10:56:02] abracka_: can't wait until you become a full time private server wildstar streamer, i'll still be here
[10:56:12] zgag: Rift was actually pretty damn good
[10:56:12] TheCakeBadger: Rift. Bless.
[10:56:18] solsaver12: Many streamers I watch play games I dont like. I dont mind, I just dont watch them stream. Very simple.
[10:56:22] vision42g: wow community chill now ppl dgaf
[10:56:27] finejeez1: ive been playing gw2 for a while now
[10:56:40] specialkidmiles: lol and he was mad
[10:56:44] Artivicii: Artivicii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[10:56:48] Praetour: It has to be some sort of deeper conspiracy than that Towelliee
[10:56:49] tigzie: so what you are saying is that those ff14 fans are overly attached girlfriend meme? @Towelliee
[10:56:49] Onearmyof2: It says you need to have a sub to retail for alpha
[10:56:50] strchsr: @Towelliee What Alpha server do you play on -- so when the servers are up I know which to create a character on
[10:56:50] Asxius: he needed extra views, he got it
[10:56:51] CCG_337: some people just like to think they play the best game. and never stop to think they play the, game that they like more
[10:57:06] LesterLinton: easier to get mad than to look at facts.
[10:57:15] metavahn231: he was hating on WoW all the way untill he smelled new content with DF alpha
[10:57:16] Funderik: case solved then, it was his own fault, end of story.
[10:57:17] kranztheman: thats alot of characters...at level 50...
[10:57:19] Lasidor: I agree @Towelliee completely with you.  People light pitchforks and torches at all these different issues lol
[10:57:23] zgag: If Quinn got into the Alpha I don't see why Preach couldn't get in
[10:57:29] Fyeah: wathcing someone stream a game doesnt have to necessarely be the same game as you play, i never understood that ppl will get angry over someone not playing what they are playing
[10:57:29] Coriollis: or he just opted on another acc that was not flagged
[10:57:37] Onearmyof2: @Towelliee it says you need a sub for alpha/beta access
[10:57:39] Bupsipooh: @zgag agreed
[10:57:41] metavahn231: now he can react to DF alpha so he likes WoW again
[10:57:48] kranztheman: @zgag he would have if he had signed up..or asked.
[10:57:49] opaldiia: preach and madsesaon leaving WOW made me sad as fuck
[10:57:50] Thatshostile: i saw you in game no way i did think it was possible
[10:57:57] MrGattz: step 1 of being a drama streamer, create your own drama. step 2, profit off sheep
[10:58:01] Astrega: @elixirfield1 period
[10:58:05] Thatshostile: different servers
[10:58:11] Rodorann: baaaaa
[10:58:14] primetimezhilex: you should get that mount now, im sending blessings
[10:58:19] PhoenixVirusTV: how do you sign up for alpha?
[10:58:34] CCG_337: I just gravitate around the same streamers I use to watch, it doesn't mean I even play the same game.
[10:58:39] strchsr: @Towelliee Which Alpha server are you on?
[10:58:42] Bupsipooh: Wasnt he told that some people didnt like him at blizzard
[10:58:56] strchsr: @Towelliee Aiet
[10:59:05] kranztheman: you can currently sign up for beta on the wow website.
[10:59:13] zgag: @kranztheman Yup. Just mainly saying that it's not some kind of conspiracy to keep Preach out
[10:59:13] opaldiia: @Bupsipooh i mean, people at blizz dont like asmon but he got alpha lol
[10:59:14] metavahn231: i feel like only half the WoW streamers are loyal to WoW, even ones like preach can quit on a dime
[10:59:14] Praetour: Blizzard not liking him cant be a reason, they hate Asmon
[10:59:21] strchsr: @Towelliee If you see "Starchaser" it'll be me, I doubt it's taken haha.
[10:59:22] Astrega: @daddypays187 nah he's too far into the hating
[10:59:24] Morpheusx25: @Praetour ^
[10:59:26] Brelshar: @Praetour Asmon is easy to hate.
[10:59:36] Keyastaron_: im already making my trees for envoker hunter and DK so im just waiting IF I GET ALPHA Kappa i never got alpha Kappa
[10:59:38] Psyhqo: Did anyone get Alpha tonight?
[10:59:42] opaldiia: @Brelshar disagree on that one
[10:59:46] isseidahk: its looking like drama so he can get noticed?
[10:59:49] Keyastaron_: Get*
[10:59:55] Artivicii: Lmfao
[11:00:03] Brelshar: @scumxprophet why? hes a degenerate waste of space that fires out bad takes by the dozen.
[11:00:10] metavahn231: preach is kind of a joke tbh lol
[11:00:17] opaldiia: @Brelshar yikes
[11:00:18] edeasknight: he did burn the bridge and said he wasn't going to cover it again, had to expect it
[11:00:21] Bupsipooh: preach doesnt seem like the kind of creator that just juices drama like that, but I could be wrong
[11:00:22] jkitchin75: @Brelshar his chat is easy to hate not him
[11:00:22] metavahn231: just starts drama for clout
[11:00:26] zgag: Belluar and Asmongold got invites.  Those guys are pretty much on the same level as Preach when it came to the Wow stuff
[11:00:33] SurelyBaked: i mean that's pretty much the twitch meta lol
[11:00:36] Artivicii: Are you saying you manipulate us towelliee
[11:00:38] Broomba: is he really sorry or not now he has alpha
[11:00:46] educatedbird13: seems like mainly streamers got access to alpha. thoughts on that?
[11:00:46] zorantt: @Towelliee Are you still horde for DF? Or will you switch back to Alliance?
[11:00:46] Honvar: Ok @brelshar
[11:00:57] dracullus: @Towelliee I remember few years ago he said Ion gave him bad look during Blizzcon xD guy always try to start drama that wow devs don't like him
[11:01:02] davecorey416: preach dogged blizzard alot and whines he didn't get alpha
[11:01:08] opaldiia: @Brelshar i disagree :)
[11:01:09] Funderik: all it does it make it look like blizzard gave him another another another chance.
[11:01:27] metavahn231: hes a overreact andy
[11:01:30] hrdstylem: @davecorey416 asmongold shits on blizzard way harder and got alpha
[11:01:51] Rodorann: lol
[11:01:52] Joryckfree: @akamsii difference is asmon from time to time says something good
[11:01:53] Brelshar: Preach has way too high an opinion of himself and his clout in the WoW community.
[11:02:06] BlewGamingGroup: enjoy the show
[11:02:06] Astrega: @akamsii yeah but: he's subbed AND can still be critical, Preach has none of that
[11:02:08] BoiAtomico: Didn't he abuse an exploit or whatever sometime ago so the cry "they don't like me" is a bit fake now?
[11:02:13] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[11:02:13] metavahn231: i always ask whats on the script today every stream
[11:02:14] SurelyBaked: true KEKW
[11:02:14] Rodorann: man is playing chess and everyone else is playing chess KEKW
[11:02:17] ZeroCold55: he never said that...he said he was a bit hurt and thats it
[11:02:18] Broomba: Bohemian Rhapsody
[11:02:20] Bupsipooh: Is this a preach bashing stream?
[11:02:23] Rodorann: checkers oof
[11:02:27] MissAriella: Good morning Towelliee and Chat! Long time no speak/see! <3 Hope alls well!
[11:02:29] zgag: @davecorey416 Asmon and Belluar dogged on Blizzard if not more than Preach.  They both got invites
[11:02:38] jkitchin75: @Bupsipooh no
[11:02:38] Roaringkittylol: Hes behaving like a guy who is jealous and mad that their ex-gf is dating another guy a few months after their break up and shes posting photos of the new guy and how happy she is.
[11:02:38] Artivicii: SHAMBLES
[11:02:39] kranztheman: @akamsii I feel like blizz would be crazy to not give him alpha...the amount of concurrent viewers he gets...
[11:02:41] CozzyFlannel: who didnt get invited? Preach?
[11:02:42] xmedpakx: no offense but what preach does or say about this game is kinda not relevant since he quit and says he does not want to play.
[11:02:49] MarquisLek: i would be a bit sad for a while
[11:02:50] Brelshar: Bellular is critical but fair, and he creates a ton of content.
[11:02:53] Frostfury: @MissAriella HOwdy towHAMUP fandyLove
[11:02:57] Praetour: "Towelliee bashes fellow streamer read all about it"
[11:02:57] metavahn231: preach is under the magnifying glass is all
[11:03:05] SurelyBaked: but to be fair, streamers are pretty much the front line of presenting games these days. They get a lot of *cough* preferential treatment *cough*
[11:03:09] opaldiia: im glad PlatinumWoW got in
[11:03:21] Kinghorn: ^
[11:03:24] SurelyBaked: nobody cares about what a developer says about a game these days, they care about what their favorite X or Y streamer says about it
[11:03:28] Banecraft: I dont understand why people are confused about this, Preach very publicly cut ties with Blizzard, and is now not getting access to Blizzard alphas. This seems par for the course.
[11:03:31] Linasha: But also Preach said some harsh things - ture but harsh - you can't expect after that to be handed alpha - especially when you say you aren't going to cover wow anymore.
[11:03:37] migas03: @scumxprophet same
[11:03:39] Linasha: But he also has the right to speak his mind
[11:03:40] Brelshar: @SurelyBaked I mean not really, even Asmons reach is tiny in comparision to the amount of players that WoW actually has.
[11:03:48] xmedpakx: @Banecraft exactly
[11:04:06] Molvonos: @Linasha He also shouldn't be surprised about the response to what he said.  'Oh no, the consequences of my own actions'
[11:04:06] exploitedz: 100% agree
[11:04:08] Arbszy: It reminds me of Panzer's meltdown when she didnt get Overwatch Beta.
[11:04:12] Cezzan: Im guessing i missed the new alpha dungeons right?
[11:04:20] Artivicii: “Proper manner” Kappa
[11:04:23] Praetour: If your livelihood depends on wow content it makes sense
[11:04:23] zgag: Think the problem is that Preach expected  a invite from Blizzard w/o opting  in
[11:04:24] opaldiia: @Arbszy oh my god I forgot about her
[11:04:28] metavahn231: they like you cause you defend WoD
[11:04:30] maxkule: @Cezzan Servers not live yet
[11:04:31] opaldiia: facebook KEKW
[11:04:32] Rodorann: who?
[11:04:34] Kinghorn: I do not think so
[11:04:37] kranztheman: @Cezzan No..still waiting for servers
[11:04:38] waaambulance_: doesnt she HATE blizzard?
[11:04:38] SurelyBaked: @Brelshar we talking about millions of views per month, 100K+ per stream for a launch asmon, right? KEKW I get what you mean though
[11:04:38] Astrega: shitting on the game is one thing, but on the people behind it? straight up disrespectful, glad he didn't get access
[11:04:39] OGXanos: Fell off
[11:04:41] egraves7: that's a name i haven't heard in quite some time
[11:04:44] Cezzan: @maxkule Oh great, ty
[11:04:45] Kinghorn: think she quit the content creation gig
[11:04:47] MerrickMoon: Let's gooo
[11:04:49] MerrickMoon: This is it
[11:04:50] migas03: holy shit panzer from that wow show ? thats so old
[11:04:51] opaldiia: she absolutely fell off
[11:04:56] Artivicii: Who is panzer and what is facebook
[11:04:57] teatimetox: why should someone who isn't a content creator for wow??? on 5op of that someone who publicly said they wouldn't cover them anymore lol
[11:05:00] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: Panzer no longer streams but she is working with Etsy
[11:05:06] waaambulance_: tradechat :)
[11:05:12] MerrickMoon: Damn
[11:05:14] MrGattz: i dont.
[11:05:16] Brelshar: @SurelyBaked Yes, in comparison to the entirety of WoW's playerbase, there really isn't a big percentage that "watch asmongold."
[11:05:20] metavahn231: gold POGGERS
[11:05:21] Joryckfree: the simple shit is he said he doesnt want to cover wow anymore and he s quitting and he was cryin bout it everywhere, he doesnt get alpha and he is crying he cant play ?
[11:05:23] Linasha: @Molvonos I agree - he shouldn't be surprised by not getting it.  But also we should be able to speak about how we feel about a game we love and want to see it better.
[11:05:24] OGXanos: Your biggest critic should be in your first wave
[11:05:32] Araphas: @teatimetox maybe to get him back into it?
[11:05:33] MrGattz: he shit on the game and then straight up said i cant support the game any longer.
[11:05:33] xmedpakx: why let a person who has said they have no interest in the game in?
[11:05:35] Tayve_: He casted the world first stuff so he's not even out of the loop
[11:05:37] Colt_Engineer: @Joryckfree big facts
[11:05:37] MerrickMoon: What was that addon that mage the frame golden?
[11:05:40] Rodorann: hahah
[11:05:42] MerrickMoon: made*
[11:05:44] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @Towelliee Panzer no longer streams but she is working with Etsy
[11:05:44] Praetour: Fill the alpha with flamers
[11:05:44] migas03: why?
[11:05:46] novlen: lol wut
[11:05:46] CAPT_Crack: the expansion would never release
[11:05:48] SirVoro: Plus you want a critic like him in there for Alphas to balance out the view points. Just not a lot of critics
[11:05:49] dracullus: @Linasha I don't think his quit video was honest, I was followed him back then and he was positive about 9.0 and 9.1 (beside covenant choice of course), then whole scandal started + blizzard introduced this stupid runes for 2nd raid and suddenly he was quiting forever because devs don't ever listen
[11:05:49] Molvonos: @Linasha There's a difference between speaking your mind and burning bridges with a vengence.
[11:05:49] CozzyFlannel: Would you rather preach get a spot than a smaller creator?
[11:05:55] Kinghorn: the person who leaks the most info should be in the first wave
[11:05:57] Onearmyof2: It says you must have an active sub for alpha/beta when you sign up.  So Preach probably didnt have a sub
[11:06:00] jamechro: because like it or not, it's not just about making a good game, it's marketing too :D
[11:06:05] cappei: Preach: I'm done covering WoW. Blizz: Okay, no Alpha then. Preach: Wait, not like that.
[11:06:12] Merqury3: @Joryckfree He didnt say that at all, just that he wasnt covering it as his main game anymore.
[11:06:13] Keyastaron_: i need to get back into FFXIV Kappa they been charging my account for the game and i havent played since december
[11:06:17] WarriorMuffins: no more gfuel sponsor?
[11:06:24] Anura_Rhel: I like how a few comments on a couple of streams about not getting into alpha have somehow turned into 'crying about it'. He said it bothered him but he even said he has no right to be bothered.
[11:06:25] Brelshar: I dont like Asmon, but he is still at least fair in his critiscm, Bellular is also fair.. Preach straigh up shat on the game.. he doesnt need or deserve Alpha access. He's not invited to the party, simple.
[11:06:26] xluckydawgx: Ooooo do i sense a Advanced flavor coming
[11:06:27] MerrickMoon: Any reason you're doing this on a RP server?
[11:06:30] Artivicii: Yooo it’s towelbot MrDestructoid
[11:06:33] jamechro: @rawcult that's disingenuous, he said he would be back if things changed lol
[11:06:37] lumaday: nicee
[11:06:40] Subtlety_FL: What I like about you @Towelliee is that you are a no bs streamer. You're chill and you keep it real with your audience. It's refreshing tbh.
[11:06:42] abracka_: hype
[11:06:42] Astrega: he's mad he can't make money off of the game he shittalked about
[11:06:42] BoiAtomico: If he said he ain't covering the game no longer, why should he be allowed access to the alpha/beta tho Towelliee? He gets pref treatment for the coverage.
[11:06:45] SirVoro: YOU GOT THE SHAKER AND THE FLAVOR?
[11:06:46] Kinghorn: he has characters on like every server MerrickMoon
[11:06:48] Carahail: Wooo! Bomer!
[11:06:51] abracka_: uber blast #1
[11:06:52] zaetemira: how many characters you have :D
[11:06:52] Strouss: Advanced.gg > all :P
[11:06:56] Broomba: GG energy?
[11:06:59] Carahail: **boomer
[11:07:00] Cooboomy: definitely gonna snag one of those
[11:07:05] SirVoro: Fuck yeah new favorite drink incoming boys and girls PogChamp
[11:07:06] Linasha: @Molvonos burning bridges with a Vengence LOL.
[11:07:07] MerrickMoon: @Kinghorn Gotcha! Thx :)
[11:07:08] cappei: Shouldn't have said it then
[11:07:08] SurelyBaked: @Brelshar though regardless, i wasn't referring to just one creator. the amount of content consumed for WoW through a content creator vs official wow post is infinitely higher, I feel like that's a fair assumption to make. Asmon has almost as many subs on YT as WoW does by himself
[11:07:12] Chiphazzord: he just means full time coverage
[11:07:16] NickLeonhearth: He wanted some brown points
[11:07:16] Chiphazzord: not ever again
[11:07:19] Merqury3: @Brelshar Are you aware of what the alpha is about? Criticism and bug fixing... they DONT need praise
[11:07:20] CozzyFlannel: idk I would assume Preach would get invited to Beta but not Alpha
[11:07:22] Greybeard_ttv: it was "content"
[11:07:22] jamechro: bro he literally said he would come back if things changed lol
[11:07:22] Linasha: That's like saying I hate you but I don't mean it.............
[11:07:31] raye_gaming22: yea i just say ill kill you and after you call the cops i say idont mean it
[11:07:32] xmedpakx: he seemed to mean it when it suited him
[11:07:36] Astrega: nah I don't buy that, he's a grown man. Being impulsive is no argument
[11:07:37] donpablo_98: hell yeaa toweliiee got a gfuel flavor in the works
[11:07:41] Molvonos: You also didn't burn that bridge tho
[11:07:42] opaldiia: yeah preach said word for word that he'll come back
[11:07:47] donpablo_98: HypeGhost HypeGhost HypeGhost
[11:07:50] Kinghorn: dont worry preach can enter giveaway for betas like the rest of us
[11:07:51] Tayve_: he also never said he wouldn't be talking about wow
[11:07:52] Kinghorn: :)
[11:07:52] Chickenpox40: preaches pride is hurting him
[11:08:01] BoiAtomico: Fuck his moral stances tbh, if he had any moral and pro transparency he wouldn't have fake hair to begin with
[11:08:02] zgag: Quinn never plays ( or barley) and got access. It's a marketing thing to have content creators ( No matter what they are playing ) to market your game to thousands of viewers
[11:08:06] Tayve_: he watches all the content update stuff
[11:08:08] Broomba: @towelliee -- are you going to use your remaining gful flavors or toss them?
[11:08:11] manmower: best to just take your licks and move forward

[11:08:14] opaldiia: @TheAtomicRam ????
[11:08:14] CozzyFlannel: His video was more about his frustration with the game and less so about the culture issue tho
[11:08:21] Funderik: ye he went so far in one direction it's hard to swing back to the other even slightly
[11:08:27] Cezzan: @TheAtomicRam Wtf? LUL
[11:08:28] Araphas: people are really overly upset about this
[11:08:28] OGXanos: Pyromancer was pretty much the same
[11:08:30] Kinghorn: quin is 1 of 5 aussie/NZ wow content creators zgag

[11:08:36] dragothicx: AYAYA
[11:08:36] Brelshar: Tip for life guys, NEVER burn your bridges.. Towelliee did'nt, Bellular and others didnt.. Preach lit the bridge on fire and pissed on the ashes.
[11:08:38] Molvonos: He burned the bridge and then pissed on the ashes @Towelliee
[11:08:45] BigHeroSixy: pepeBASS LAHEE
[11:08:46] Artivicii: LAA HEE
[11:08:48] opaldiia: @OGXanos well Pyro is insane, so thats more fitting
[11:08:48] Kinghorn: pyro fucked himself

[11:08:56] Kinghorn: pyro is not in the same league as preach
[11:08:59] manmower: never piss on your sandwich before you eat it
[11:09:05] SirVoro: Plus the fact a lot his streams at the time were just him shitting on the game AND the company for a bout 2 weeks after his video
[11:09:05] SavageGaz: what ui do you use :)
[11:09:05] BadeTrapp: PokMaskedpika
[11:09:07] Lasidor: @Towelliee The real question is, who went harder in the paint? Preach or Pyro lol
[11:09:09] classicfluffy: the issue I have with the whole preach thing is, he was the only one to officially announce wow is dead to him
[11:09:11] Astrega: he shot himself onh the foot that's all
[11:09:13] Hitokiri83: dont bite the hand that essentially pays your bills
[11:09:16] CozzyFlannel: i think he mainly said he was tired of making negative content about the game
[11:09:21] Kinghorn: pyro leaked NDA shit Lasidor
[11:09:23] TheFox0228: Quitting WoW is a "For now" sort of deal
[11:09:25] Chickenpox40: I quit like 4 times already
[11:09:25] cabalish: @SavageGaz !ui

[11:09:26] zaetemira: @Chickenpox40 hahah yes :D also blizzard is acknowledging his attitude against them so they not giving him the opportunity to benefit from alpha at all :D Tbh Blizzard devs work real fucking hard and getting trashed by a streamer will have some kind of effects in some way :D
[11:09:27] SurelyBaked: not to mention it just isn't smart as a content creator to burn bridges like that
[11:09:30] classicfluffy: pyro can only rage, nothing more
[11:09:30] Arbszy: Preach is great and I felt his pain.
[11:09:33] Effin_Steffin: Good.
[11:09:34] kiroslays: When you play WoW for this long it never ends man.... We all get pissed at the game and blizzard
[11:09:34] Broomba: @towelliee what is a good time to start and try advanced gg?
[11:09:38] youngsepz: yeah thats what happens when you burn the bridge lmao
[11:09:48] opaldiia: I love Preach, i think he should be in for sure
[11:09:49] Brelshar: True
[11:09:49] teatimetox: LOL RUNNING LAST XPAC EXTREMES
[11:09:51] nightwolf_87: Preach ?
[11:09:52] MrGattz: he burned a bridge and expected blizzard to send him a yacht. idk.
[11:09:54] Merex760: We've all been in video game prison for 10+ years and don't know life without WoW Sadge
[11:10:02] kapparN: preach, madseason, pyromancer, stoopz are really not welcome again ... they literally pissed on wow when things looked bad on the game/company and now that WoW is hype (= money) ... what a joke
[11:10:04] Kneckt: people forget preach was prob exhausted from the interviews with ion and what not that went no where lol
[11:10:05] SurelyBaked: @MrGattz 100%
[11:10:05] Roaringkittylol: Dont bite the hand that feeds you
[11:10:07] Frostfury: Preach is fine just crushed as hell. Breaks are always good, stepping away from a game is also good
[11:10:08] eaglerydr: He took a stand. So he needs to stand by those convictions. Talk the talk now walk the walk.
[11:10:09] Astrega: now I hope he doesn't burn the bridges for FF, hope it taught him a lesson
[11:10:17] abracka_: @kapparN chill dawg
[11:10:19] CLOUDSOFF: he's all about the money and it cost him
[11:10:24] maxkule: On another topic, Ive been playing Ghost of Tsushima and that game slaps hard.
[11:10:25] Chickenpox40: I love preach but he is acting a little childish
[11:10:26] SurelyBaked: exactly
[11:10:41] Praetour: I think because you werent blaming the individuals but the organization whereas some people took their protest to include the workers
[11:10:42] BoiAtomico: what's the deal with pyro anyway dudes? Never seen that fella but everyone mentions him
[11:10:45] dragothicx: KEKW
[11:10:46] Ziephier: have had to stop playing WOW at different times when I kept trying to fall asleep doing the same type of things
[11:10:46] waaambulance_: LUL
[11:10:49] zaetemira: @kapparN i hope all of those guys dont get alpha till all regions are released :P
[11:10:49] SurelyBaked: We're all in bobby's world
[11:10:57] nightwolf_87: Preach can play the beta with everyone els :p
[11:10:58] Brelshar: Im sure he can flag his account for the Beta access like the rest of us normies and create content if he really wants too.
[11:10:59] Winter7735: Bobbys world LUL

[11:11:21] Odinslayer: @kapparN i mean its true not gonna lie, but stoopz and pyro are doing good with ffxiv and lost ark but preach he just went super ham on wow its sad
[11:11:24] opaldiia: pyromancer was worse lol
[11:11:25] SurelyBaked: he actually played a hand instead of just stepping away from the table
[11:11:29] Chickenpox40: dude he went overboasrd

[11:11:40] d_elven_lord: @towelliee loved your new city content for Dragonflight, I have been waiting for a Dragon based expansion since Vanilla…totally stoked
[11:11:42] officialviz: Pyromancer literally had a breakdown, he was worse imo
[11:11:43] teatimetox: it was like rich haha off the deep end
[11:11:43] opaldiia: pyro had a legit mental breakdown on stream
[11:11:43] Astrega: yeah he was disrespectful, now he's punished for his childlike attitude
[11:11:45] Onearmyof2: yeah had to unfollow cause of all the shit talking
[11:11:51] Tayve_: what ahppened with pyro?
[11:11:54] MerrickMoon: the pyro snap LUL
[11:12:02] Tayve_: I missed this xD
[11:12:02] SurelyBaked: at the end of the day corpa gonna corpa
[11:12:04] pomi2137: Pyro lost it last time I saw his stream
[11:12:09] Cezzan: Asmon was never going to quit wow anyway LUL
[11:12:10] Fyeah: honestly when i saw preach in the RWF i knew he was talking bs back then
[11:12:16] Odinslayer: pyro melt down was justified though
[11:12:18] opaldiia: asmon is WoW's biggest content creator, regardless of what people think of him
[11:12:19] OriXan: asmon never said he would never return to wow, in fact, he stated he saw himself returning
[11:12:19] Rottencoarse: did i miss the dungeon runs @Towelliee ?
[11:12:21] edeasknight: asmon always comes back

[11:12:36] kapparN: @kapparN I don't think asmon can be compared to preach. Asmon talks shit, Preach/madseason/etc said he was not going to cover WoW anymore. LOL
[11:12:36] teatimetox: pretty sure asmon didnt post a YouTube video that he is done covering wow
[11:12:37] opaldiia: @Odinslayer LOL what
[11:12:40] Cezzan: I mean most of us here are doing the same thing, we love wow and just take breaks from it
[11:12:43] raye_gaming22: but unlike mike zacks palying wow every day
[11:12:55] tomster2300: Glad you said it. Preach definitely seemed hypocritical with wow.
[11:12:55] CozzyFlannel: it seems the gaming space has so much nostalgia for the old titles - the games just arent keeping up
[11:12:57] manmower: if content comes out faster these people might stick around

[11:15:08] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I got Alpha Pog
[11:15:13] strchsr: @Towelliee I assume you should be able to do them at whatever level it sends you to the Azure Span at right, like 65?
[11:15:14] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Thanks for the key Towelliee
[11:15:14] Cezzan: @Santacloz those 6 hours are the intro KEKW

[11:20:13] opaldiia: you have to have an active sub though
[11:20:23] Arbszy: When beta key time comes that shit is going to be wild.

[11:21:37] OGTigolebitties: whoever made the comment that this is a PVE game probably said that because you tried PVP and you got butthurt because everyone kicked your ass in arena
[11:21:37] love_eggplant: loveegHappy

[11:22:13] opaldiia: is there a way to see if your account has strikes?
[11:22:14] Austei: lol pvp in wow is such trash
[11:22:16] Truthseeker96: PVP is the true end game content lbs
[11:22:16] mavericks312: pvp is a backburner feature in this game

[11:22:18] MrGattz: 5%
[11:22:19] edeasknight: pvp is a minigame 👀
[11:22:20] UltraContent: a lot
[11:22:21] catalyticflow: pvp this expansion is getting oneshot by paladins
[11:22:24] UltraContent: poll?
[11:22:28] manmower: they haven't put a lot of development into new pvp systems, although we did get solo queue now
[11:22:29] Cezzan: Pvp stopped being as important as pve in cata or so id say
[11:22:30] Astrega: well history develops in PVE not PVP
[11:22:30] UltraContent: poll it? :D
[11:22:39] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee did you see the post on mmo-champion about stuff added in this build ? looks like inscription is going to make stuff for customizing your dragon
[11:22:40] CardinalTX: pvpers think they tough irl    lolz
[11:22:41] OGTigolebitties: your right, ill own it i suck at pve , or i just done like it, so i just wouldnt play the game if it wasnt a thing
[11:22:42] xmedpakx: @Towelliee exactly what i meant
[11:22:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: i stopped pvping in vanilla once i got a raid spot
[11:22:44] Cezzan: @manmower Pvp talents were a great addition
[11:22:44] OGTigolebitties: 100% right
[11:22:45] metavahn231: pvp is one sided and never balanced
[11:22:56] Strouss: impossable to balnce.
[11:22:58] PrimalRain: they barely try with pvp, that's part of it
[11:22:59] Brelshar: PvP is more fun in Classic than it is in retail lol.
[11:23:00] MrGattz: polling a PVE streamers chat is kinda bias dont you think @UltraContent lol
[11:23:01] Poriand: im mostly a pvp player but man m+ has been way more fun lately
[11:23:02] Truthseeker96: yeah imo we gear again and again every season/tier. So we got that down to a T. but pvp. Always room to improve
[11:23:04] PokerFaceMoose: if you think wows a pvp game ask whens the last time they added a bg
[11:23:05] manmower: arena fights just take too long, too much self-healing
[11:23:08] Strouss: they do good for what it is imo
[11:23:10] Shuttlelol: @Arbszy for sure, i can heal or dps :D
[11:23:11] pepega_in_the_chat69: whens the servers coming back up
[11:23:11] Rabin24: Man i miss Cata PvP best expansion when it came to PvP
[11:23:11] pomi2137: There is a TEAM that works on pvp? LOL
[11:23:13] OGTigolebitties: true true
[11:23:14] SurelyBaked: I'd love to get into PvP but since I don't have an established rating I can't get into any groups to even progress myself so i just said screw it and stuck to mythic raiding KEKW
[11:23:16] Nebulizer87: no new battlegrounds xD
[11:23:31] manmower: they need to focus on some new BG content

[11:23:47] killswiitch: They should just add more bgs.
[11:23:48] Killinitcroy: what are you playing when alpha is up?
[11:23:49] Cezzan: KEKW
[11:23:54] Brelshar: They should give AV and Wintergrasp a real overhaul.
[11:23:58] UltraContent: @MrGattz  well im a pvper but i follow the stream too, and maybe some pve player plays pvp too
[11:24:00] manmower: PVP Warfronts
[11:24:05] SurelyBaked: KEKW
[11:24:08] mavericks312: thats a no for me dawg lol
[11:24:10] SurelyBaked: i wish they actually made more casual content
[11:24:11] Rodorann: lol KEKW
[11:24:14] OGTigolebitties: i loved the timeless isles era for sure , they did a good job with that from a content for pvp standpoint
[11:24:14] Molvonos: PvP is Pay to Win right?  Players Vs. Pocketbooks?
[11:24:15] OGXanos: PvP Islands was an incredible idea that somehow didn't pan out
[11:24:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: 100% true LUL
[11:24:17] opaldiia: maybe a store mount POGGERS
[11:24:18] metavahn231: warfronts took priority over pvp

[11:24:27] Sielu11628: Leaked!
[11:24:27] killswiitch: Casuals pvp though
[11:24:29] Sielu11628: towCopium
[11:24:32] Thoreya: They have a pvp senior designer position open to build battlegrounds lol
[11:24:35] Thoreya: Saw it the other day
[11:24:37] UltraContent: BibleThump
[11:24:39] xmedpakx: let add more pve stuff for the 99% of players,, i dig it
[11:24:42] brian_777777777: we will make you one mount KEKW
[11:24:45] Truthseeker96: @Molvonos no lol its player vs player.
[11:24:47] manmower: they need to add affixes to BGs
[11:24:48] SurelyBaked: @killswiitch casuals don't pvp, casuals die to people that pvp KEKW
[11:24:50] UltraContent: @Towelliee  bg every 5 exp
[11:24:52] Aenvys: valeCry
[11:24:53] Deadelus0: We will put it on "the backlog" :-P
[11:24:53] death_cam_: well they do add new arenas every 1-2 patches tbh
[11:24:53] Akermay: Imagining a big signposted PvP naughty step in Blizz HQ
[11:24:55] Praetour: Lets put that one on the backseat for now and we'll circle back around to it
[11:24:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: reusing already made pve skins
[11:25:02] Kinghorn: nothing gets me harder than some pillar humping
[11:25:02] Jokervenom1978: Im gonna need you to come in on SAAAATURDAY. yaaaa
[11:25:06] Shuttlelol: arena every patch? best we can do is one every five years
[11:25:06] SurelyBaked: saaaame
[11:25:11] Raeliff: bfa
[11:25:11] mozavich: pvp developers, yeah... imma need you to come in on saturday.   pvp developers: yeah nevermind

[11:25:13] UltraContent: kek true
[11:25:14] catalyticflow: worst bg
[11:25:14] metavahn231: only AV matters
[11:25:15] TwinksNotDead: worst one
[11:25:16] Taylgator: are the alpha servers down?
[11:25:17] Cezzan: Imagine getting a class specific armor or something for your dragonflighting mount with a new mage tower @Towelliee
[11:25:17] Roaringkittylol: They should just get rid of Arena's and focus dev time on BGs and RBGS
[11:25:18] brian_777777777: epic bgs are the best
[11:25:19] strchsr: @Towelliee Seething Shore?
[11:25:19] Thatshostile: are you gunns dtream the raid?
[11:25:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Give us solo queue RBGs 😠
[11:25:20] MrGattz: @UltraContent oh for sure, 100%. but because its a pve streamer the majority of people watching are pve focused. where as if you poll a pvp streamers chat its gonna be mostly pvpers. plus 3k people really doesnt capture the 30m players across the world very well lol
[11:25:21] Truthseeker96: azerite battleground is dog shit
[11:25:22] manmower: he's gonna turn BGs into Battle Royale, only 1 orc left standing
[11:25:22] Onearmyof2: watch Holinka is gunna bust down your door
[11:25:22] OGTigolebitties: yeah they have been slacking
[11:25:25] XshadowturkeyX: bfa prepatch
[11:25:26] Poriand: WSG the best
[11:25:27] Brelshar: They should take the existing BG's and rework the ones that suck.
[11:25:28] opaldiia: ye
[11:25:29] dracullus: well we get arena almost every patch, I don't even know why
[11:25:30] TwinksNotDead: Strand of the Ancients was better
[11:25:32] XshadowturkeyX: seething shore
[11:25:36] brian_777777777: just play frost and do a million damage
[11:25:37] Truthseeker96: I love the bg with the 4 orbs
[11:25:40] killswiitch: Bgs are fun areas are boring af
[11:25:42] catalyticflow: it's called seething shores because the disrespect in quality is so much
[11:25:43] Thatshostile: would love to see raid content
[11:25:43] Truthseeker96: that one is the best imo
[11:25:47] death_cam_: they could add in the bgs that never made it live
[11:25:52] manmower: yea seething is terrible, the mine cart one is alright
[11:25:54] Broomba: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny
[11:25:56] SurelyBaked: "sorry guys, i know we created an entire new expansion with several continents and classes and races and raids and etc... but adding another room for you to stab each other in is asking a bit much"
[11:25:57] LoseAlotLuke: How old is she now? @Towelliee
[11:25:58] MasterNeff: the last good bg they made was temple of kotmogu
[11:26:00] Vomin1881: shaman tree is up

[11:26:23] UltraContent: @MrGattz  ofc, but with those 2 polls done, u know the cross % of pvp +pver
[11:26:25] MrGattz: fun? DansGame
[11:26:26] killswiitch: Sounds good to me
[11:26:26] OGTigolebitties: i wish they would do some open world pvp events more, kinda like they had with timeless isles but better
[11:26:26] TwinksNotDead: @dragothicx Yep
[11:26:27] manmower: they should add PVP to Mythic Raiding, both teams race through same bosses on opposite sides, they meet at the end boss
[11:26:30] OGXanos: Wintergrasp maaan
[11:26:39] waaambulance_: 5 already, time flies
[11:26:41] metavahn231: the onyl time i have even a slight bit of fun in WoW pvp is open world pvp
[11:26:43] solsaver12: I like how Blizzard did pvp in Nazjatar

[11:27:03] kiffel76: Mage talent drop just saw that
[11:27:03] taintalizerx: shes still a puppy
[11:27:09] CrackedOrb: 5fps Nazjatar PvP, yikes
[11:27:17] Ezmaraldaa: I used to get up early to play Wintergrasp lol
[11:27:18] Linasha: my 10 week old puppy is having an epic battle with the door stop atm
[11:27:21] manmower: maybe we'll get a BG that uses Dragonriding
[11:27:21] MerrickMoon: The one that made that shiny golden nalak alert?
[11:27:31] solsaver12: yup
[11:27:35] teatimetox: very one sided
[11:27:36] strchsr: @Towelliee Have you considered playing on Wyrmrest Accord, it's a pretty chill place
[11:27:36] killswiitch: Yeah man it was cool af
[11:27:36] Ragura: ye it was so awesome
[11:27:36] itsbliznit: Yeah it was organic whic hwas cool
[11:27:37] SavageGaz: Does anyone recommend new class to level up  with new wisdom tomorrow?
[11:27:37] OGTigolebitties: they need more of that
[11:27:39] Cezzan: World pvp was alive on bfa
[11:27:40] SurelyBaked: i wish there was more world pvp incentivization, especially this next xpac with dragons flying around and shit
[11:27:41] xmedpakx: warmode in BFA was way better
[11:27:41] Xtops: imho, pvp the 1st 3 weeks of SL was amazing,.. when everyone was at same ilvl,...
[11:27:43] ShaunsterTheMonster: Supply drop was cool
[11:27:51] UltraContent: horde assaullts on boralus was so cool
[11:27:52] Barret: except the mega zerging with groups converging in one phase
[11:27:52] manmower: Legion with the pvp-enabled areas could be expanded on
[11:27:53] metavahn231: ASHRAN was good
[11:27:55] catalyticflow: BFA was a gutted Legion and shadowlands was a gutted bfa
[11:27:57] SurelyBaked: imagine dragons dive bombing you KEKW
[11:28:01] Mivoc: I loved the world quest pvp in Legion
[11:28:07] solsaver12: Ashran was great for 1 week
[11:28:09] Orion280: is there any way to leave feedback on dragonflight without being in the alpha?
[11:28:09] Cezzan: Nostalgia hitting hard LUL
[11:28:12] metavahn231: summon the tree
[11:28:17] ArcaneMaki: My man says Ashran was good.
[11:28:18] Praetour: Ashran was good when it was populated and for the first 2 or 3 matches
[11:28:19] Atem___: mount party
[11:28:19] killswiitch: I liked assram lol
[11:28:20] feherlofia123: ashran was good for healers
[11:28:21] Aidler: pv..what in SL
[11:28:24] Nowaayjose: Supply drops in mega hell? Would it make sense tho
[11:28:24] MerrickMoon: Is the other alert addon called SilverDragon - Rare Scanner ?
[11:28:27] Broomba: @towelliee -- new alpha build goes live when you go offline
[11:28:29] TheFox0228: Ashran was one of the best BGs, the only problem is that the teams were one sided and the things needed balancing a bit more KEKW
[11:28:31] kaffi11537: sorry to ask but how does feral looks like ? xD
[11:28:40] dracullus: world pvp was awesome on bfa launch, especially that quest for Horde/Alliance slayer

[11:29:55] metavahn231: guild wars used to be literally pvp with a side pve content, now its all pve
[11:29:59] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Call their bluff, pretend to go offline, so that they will bring up the servers
[11:30:00] xmedpakx: i wish new world had been more pve oriented.. its so pretty
[11:30:10] Mivoc: new world is a lost cause
[11:30:10] Astrega: biggest flaw of NW was the LACK of content at high level
[11:30:15] ArcaneMaki: Just that they lost 85% of their player base
[11:30:17] Cezzan: New world was so promising Sadge
[11:30:23] manmower: @elixirfield1 doesn't GW2 have that living pvp zone? that might work in WoW

[11:31:10] Arbszy: GW2 pve is really good
[11:31:14] metavahn231: gw2 have more cutscenes than xiv now

[11:32:53] Astrega: @watpuppy unlikely
[11:32:57] manmower: more people watch arena than RWF
[11:33:15] Kloshx: Mythic + did fill a gap where players couldnt do shit because there werent raids , and then end up un pvp , but with mythic+ that ppl left pvp
[11:33:16] Brelshar: Focus just needs to be 100% in PvE, PvP should always be a side thing.

[11:33:38] dragothicx: get out KEKW
[11:33:45] kungbillan: new place with timeless isle concept? Mixed in with some Wintergrasp elements for improved pvp every 2 hours or so, even better a rotation of pvp events every 2h, not just one. That would be a nice addition to the game for both PvP and PvE community, add in some made up currency for mounts, pets and so on :P
[11:33:45] oRiie: I want some of whatever that guy is on
[11:33:45] BlewGamingGroup: are we even playing the same game
