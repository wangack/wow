[1:10:45] dibreno: new talent
[1:11:05] RJ_Yuna: I agree with Asmon, they should remove all the data tracking addons in retail and make it to where no one knows dmg and stuff and just play what you want instead of meta and only get people in your raid group that know mechanics and not just top DPS
[1:11:08] cripplious: I read his family kept it a secret for a week so they could greieve

[1:12:46] abracka_: er, DPS mod
[1:12:56] Shrift1: Can't agree with that, i mean i like using them to. But without them some boss fights are impossible to do correctly
[1:13:08] SinicalDev: addons have never been easier to install, i remember having to manually unzip that shit

[1:16:04] Neowanderer: just have them die at teh start of the fight
[1:16:05] Shrift1: @iBanEvader I mean i disagree with asmon on 95% of the things, not rading stuff
[1:16:15] Ozzyminion: there is a safe middle ground
[1:16:20] vulkankragon: i think FF14 is the most overrated mmo. that game is extremely mid tier and doesn't deserve the attention it gets
[1:16:21] Broomba: true
[1:16:25] Airomar: a aadon who is warning u the xy mechnck is going of is one think.. a addon/WA who counts and says go 3m left go to mark x and push ure raid cd in 5 sec is aother story

[1:17:08] thepazoo: And aug

[1:17:36] jkitchin75: @archmagii94 stop it
[1:17:40] iBanEvader: the fact blizzard UI is so bad and uninformative is the reason we have so many addons also
[1:17:45] SamuraiWillZ916: how do you know both ?
[1:17:54] Shrift1: True, but i think raiding today is just to overwhelming @iBanEvader
[1:17:55] Arawn67: i only don’t like the extreem metta gaming for m+ making it hard for some classes and spec to get groups
[1:17:56] iBanEvader: if you take those addons away the game is going to be worse

[1:19:22] dracullus: and now he is in prison of constant drama, wow is not enough now he must bitch about everything xD
[1:19:35] Stugtron: cata quests are so fire hands down best xpac next to vanilla
[1:19:43] iBanEvader: @abracka_ but lately (last few years) his stream is a huge echo chamber
[1:19:49] iBanEvader: people that go against his opinion are being permabanned
[1:19:54] SinicalDev: @iBanEvader Broken clock is right twice a day
[1:19:59] Ozzyminion: 14 years of ffxiv and still no need for addons , I know there two different games but there is a way to do it better
[1:20:15] chiaotzusupporter: pretty sure asmon's take is to remove all addons and make the game simpler because its way too complicated and overtuned due to the addons and data that's available through them
[1:20:40] Shrift1: He used to give good critical opinions about game, now it is mostly just destructive criticism which is anoying

[1:21:01] iBanEvader: @Ozzyminion the ff14 UI is 10 times better than WoW
[1:21:06] iBanEvader: we need the addons in WoW
[1:21:06] SinicalDev: Addon discourse is manufactured by content creators who need another vector to rile people up for
[1:21:18] vulkankragon: i agree with asmongold on only one thing, blizzard needs to make retail wow more new player friendly and right now its not
[1:21:22] iBanEvader: even after the WoW UI rework it feels lackluster
[1:21:36] Stugtron: most wow bosses have good visual ques but the minute you need “weak auras” I wanna vom
[1:21:44] flyingmachin3: could ff do that for 20 instead of 8?

[1:21:52] Ozzyminion: no your right towlee that ship has sailed
[1:21:53] iBanEvader: @Towelliee people going to value other players with or without details

[1:22:21] redthirteen1: How would I know if my numbers are bigger than another dudes numbers?
[1:22:24] SpidercowSD: TBH Most people Tunnel and ignore Mechs, thats why you have Shot Callers or Raid callers even with addons
[1:22:36] Wcvechten: Sepulcher? Time for the jailer
[1:22:40] iBanEvader: and ff14 is toxic positivity in my eyes @Towelliee
[1:22:58] Ozzyminion: I think my main problem with retail wow is its tendency towards a mobile game feel now , nothing wrong with the content the delivery sucks
[1:23:01] Vondrex: I remember when I went to Rift, and the simple DPS meter was all i needed to play that game.
[1:23:04] t_train_va: Not anymore
[1:23:09] t_train_va: They cracked down on it with streams
[1:23:10] Needdaann: Rip Akira Toriyama FeelsBadMan

[1:23:18] roflenskoy: The problem is that you HAVE TO perform in nowadays, not only in wow, even IRL
[1:23:29] abracka_: it was a mod
[1:23:30] t_train_va: Yes
[1:23:33] Thoreya: @Ozzyminion what makes it feel like a mobile game?
[1:23:37] t_train_va: But even DPS meters will get you banned
[1:23:42] Ozzyminion: yes they did it’s how they got world first

[1:23:52] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog

[1:24:00] abracka_: the casual andy community of XIV goes ballistic on the subreddit if they see a streamer using mods
[1:24:06] abracka_: but most of the playerbase uses mods
[1:24:10] abracka_: so *shrug*
[1:24:13] SamuraiWillZ916: one had a dps addon and got banned after a world first i think
[1:24:13] iBanEvader: @t_train_va so no one can improve
[1:24:22] iBanEvader: @t_train_va it's toxic positivity
[1:24:24] SamuraiWillZ916: because it was on twitch or something

[1:24:30] t_train_va: Oh DPS meters are used
[1:24:46] t_train_va: And the ToS encourages toxic positivity

[1:25:48] iBanEvader: artificially enforcing good behavior by limiting communication @Towelliee
[1:26:00] iBanEvader: so people can't see or complain about other's damage numbers etc.
[1:26:02] iBanEvader: yea that's it
[1:26:04] abracka_: the pressure to only display positive emotions

[1:31:35] tlsmith3638: @vulkankragon spoiler are rthe gracest of sins and needs to ne punished
[1:31:50] Wcvechten: I miss when it was is hotdog a sandwich discussion
[1:31:55] tlsmith3638: grasvest*
[1:32:11] Ozzyminion: Somenone asked why it felt like a Mobile game , I think due to all the arcade feeling mini games now in the game
[1:32:12] abracka_: i'm just taking a giggle at us just talkin shit
[1:32:31] Kakotan2143: gg
[1:32:32] tlsmith3638: i cant type for shit this morning
[1:33:03] Ozzyminion: They arnt inherantly bad , i just feel liek they are extreaneous and cause alot of people to loose focus
[1:33:23] tlsmith3638: does the boss die then there enough dps
[1:33:31] DieWing7: The only objective in FF14 is cat girls.  :D
[1:33:31] vulkankragon: too much restriction there. it turns me off from playing the game.
[1:33:32] t_train_va: Trials
[1:33:33] Ozzyminion: I tank towelee so i can avoid the pressure of dps
[1:33:35] TheItalianStallion321: trials
[1:33:36] Ozzyminion: Trials
[1:34:03] 3663Sharad: POG
[1:34:08] Ozzyminion: I have yet to come across a toxic player in FFxiv
[1:34:11] BigPapaGrizz: the amount of people in chats ive seen say "they changed the talents back to wrath style for Cata Pog" people forget they didn't move away from the trees until mop?
[1:34:26] tlsmith3638: everyone is a dps in ffxiv lol
[1:34:34] Ozzyminion: True i dont run the extreme uppper end raids in ffxiv
[1:34:50] Ozzyminion: those raids scare the shyte outta me
[1:34:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spider cave!
[1:35:23] Ozzyminion: I love cata
[1:35:35] Ozzyminion: worgen was the best origin story
[1:35:37] BigPapaGrizz: it seems a lot about cata has been forgotten. its honestly the best xpack for pvp and top 3 for pve in my opinion. Classes felt amazing too!
[1:35:44] Volders1993: Modern Talent system whilst not perfect are pretty damn good
[1:35:55] abracka_: the shockadin build for prot paladin tanking in SoD right now is fun as fuck
[1:36:01] iBanEvader: I always thought there's not really much experimenting with the talent trees in WoW
[1:36:08] DieWing7: I've always liked the talent trees
[1:36:08] iBanEvader: there's always an obvious better choice
[1:36:12] silentknight190: cata has to be the end of remaking old expansions
[1:36:30] Wcvechten: rare pog
[1:36:34] iBanEvader: @Volders1993 I think the retail system is way better than old classic talents
[1:36:39] abracka_: 32-40 only took me about ~15 runs of SM
[1:36:58] BigPapaGrizz: they will stop at mop or legion
[1:37:00] Ozzyminion: always was in cata
[1:37:00] iBanEvader: also the ease is a lot more fun
[1:37:07] iBanEvader: we really need dual spec in every classic version
[1:37:26] Ozzyminion: they wont go past MoP
[1:37:28] fillefaren: Wish i had this much passion for wow
[1:37:29] jkitchin75: @silentknight190 i will not be
[1:37:34] fillefaren: like in the good old days
[1:38:00] jkitchin75: @Ozzyminion if it makes them money thay will
[1:38:00] Shagathal: Wasn't the levelling made way smoother in Cata due to the rearrangement of the world?
[1:38:06] Klutar: cata classic needs war mode to save the dying pve servers
[1:38:08] iBanEvader: @Shagathal yea

[1:38:34] KaisenSiru: I much prefer Cata leveling

[1:42:47] Shagathal: Only bad thing about Cata was me getting benched at the end of BWD by an Ele-shaman, I was a Resto, who could play all day while I had to work during the day and gather all the resources for the HC-raiding days. Overall Cata was a good expansion imo.
[1:42:48] tlsmith3638: did they change the garrosh dialong?
[1:42:50] vulkankragon: do you think they will continue classic after mop? wod classic sounds like a bad dream
[1:43:05] Aidler: doubt there will be some Cata+

[1:45:11] Axesmittayyy: can you keep your character from beta and play in launch?
[1:45:23] dibreno: What’s the point of a beta only allowing ppl to lvl 1-60 with nothing other than leveling being what made cataclysm
[1:45:23] SinicalDev: @Axesmittayyy no
[1:45:32] RagingPunk: i doubt it lol
[1:45:41] leishen1990: Classic? LOL

[1:48:35] Ozzyminion: alot of the quests are the same...however alot of them were reimagined becuase of the major zone changes , flow of quests was chaged to avoid quests that took you all over the world
[1:48:40] RagingPunk: prob some quality of life stuff i think
[1:48:52] ALSlLVER: I started playing cata when I was 12 (my first expansion). So I never got to experience the difference back then
[1:49:08] dibreno: I’m not asking for exacts. but speculatively. How long do u think beta will be before release?

[1:50:31] Ozzyminion: enhance shaman best it ever was in cata
[1:50:35] tlsmith3638: the bitching at the start of cata after the face roll of wotlk dungeons  was huge
[1:50:37] rank1playerlul: @abracka_ just llike back in the days? =p
[1:50:55] Rhun0z: it will be so fun :)
[1:50:56] rushof90: the biggest thing about cats beta last time was the stand in the fire achievement deal where feathering kills the whole zone was wayyy overturned to where he would wipe your zone every 10 - 15 mins
[1:51:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah people can opt-in for more difficulty with gamma or whatever

[1:51:42] Ozzyminion: i think entry level heroics will feel like gamme wotlk
[1:51:50] Aidler: og cata dungeons
[1:51:59] TheItalianStallion321: is resist gear still big in Cata like it was in TBC and WOTLK?
[1:52:11] RagingPunk: sweet
[1:52:21] Wcvechten: nah, resist gear basically didn't matter
[1:52:31] Ozzyminion: not really stallian
[1:52:31] rank1playerlul: God, I hope we don't get a MoP classic @Towelliee
[1:52:51] Ozzyminion: I know shadow resist was needed in bastion of twilight
[1:52:55] Rhun0z: do you think there will be fresh start servers?

[1:54:02] TheItalianStallion321: @Wcvechten i have a paladin at 80 already
[1:54:04] Ozzyminion: I also dont think they will make more servers either which means sharding in first 2 weeks will be horrendous until population settles , spcifically on Larger servers
[1:54:05] Wcvechten: It's my main to this day ever since lmao @TheItalianStallion321

[3:02:20] Epicsapphire1988: i wish they did BC server i can stay there forever
[3:02:21] kimmo_gaming: they should make legendaries targeted with a currency or something so you dont get your bis in 6 months
[3:02:38] Ozzyminion: its just too much work for not enough profit too have era servers for each expack
[3:02:44] fetza108: @geokouts cata is the base of retail
[3:02:49] Wulfgrym: @TheItalianStallion321 no, no you can't sir LUL
[3:02:56] Arendiel_: I want wotlk era peepoSad
[3:03:06] HilariousMax: only good thing about BC was the initial cluster of the portal opening and the clown armor throughout
[3:03:18] Ozzyminion: and if you consider that one sub covers all forms of the game they aint making bank on old content
[3:03:26] KaisenSiru: Wrath PepeLaugh
[3:03:35] Thoreya: ya i guess
[3:03:46] Thoreya: just thought if any old expac theyd have servers for, itd be wrath
[3:04:30] HilariousMax: Can't wait for The End LUL
[3:04:30] Cairfaig: the rares where good for cata levelling too, fair bit of exp whilst out questing
[3:04:35] lodrynne: Cata was a weird exp.
[3:04:47] josephrt10: They should do sesson of discovery for all the expacs in my opinion
[3:04:51] Ozzyminion: Can you imagine a mega server that you could force shard to whichever expack you wanted to pay.
[3:05:00] Ozzyminion: play
[3:05:24] Ozzyminion: I know chromie time is similar
[3:05:26] Wcvechten: SOD shadowlands
[3:05:39] Shagathal: I guess it's the vocal minority painting a different picture than reality is.
[3:06:00] fetza108: @lodrynne you didnt find joy in it. Thats okay but the exp was not weird.
[3:06:20] Cairfaig: they'd be spending so much on staff wages with all the different teams
[3:06:35] TheItalianStallion321: @Wulfgrym please? lol
[3:06:37] Ozzyminion: oh no they are right cata had some weird stuff , like thralls story line weird AF
[3:06:50] rbolude: they prolly dont even have enough devs to keep up with all of that
[3:06:57] josephrt10: Will they do pvp nerfs ?
[3:07:08] nitroe: 1st raid tier of cata is one of the best of an xpac launch imo. May just play for that
[3:07:39] Wulfgrym: @TheItalianStallion321 no! LOL
[3:07:58] Molvonos: I'm unsure if I want to play in Cata.  I mean, we'd likely have a community guild for it, yea?  That's kind of one reason I didn't have the draw to play Cata originally - didn't have anyone to really play it with.
[3:08:01] fetza108: Cata > SoD anytime
[3:08:31] Aro725: @fetza108 100p
[3:08:32] Ozzyminion: i thin k this time around people will appreciate cata more
[3:08:34] Wulfgrym: i like my sod, i don't know if i want to play cata or not
[3:08:36] Dudutoolbox: guardian wasnt a spec in cata right?
[3:09:09] Ozzyminion: @Dudutoolbox  good question man
[3:09:29] Cairfaig: when do you get SOR for spender
[3:09:32] Molvonos: Yea, it was just 'Feral'
[3:09:43] Aro725: @Dudutoolbox its still one spec with feral
[3:09:48] Goatsguffle: @Dudutoolbox yeah it was just feral and you could still bear tank though
[3:09:53] Aro725: doesnt get its own spec till mop
[3:10:18] roflenskoy: your first mount will be almost free since you are a paladin
[3:10:18] Dudutoolbox: yeah i thought i remember people just going bear form and that being it
[3:10:30] lil_jay_jay123: hey chat I'm new I'm JJ

[3:10:53] Molvonos: I'm chill
[3:11:06] lil_jay_jay123: @Towelliee hru
[3:11:09] Ozzyminion: @Dudutoolbox guardian was not a seperate spec but the tree was much more specifically geared towards choosing dps or Tank not as much hybridization
[3:11:20] gallywyx4721: theres only 9 people on the beta why havent they given out more invites
[3:11:28] lil_jay_jay123: @Molvonos its me Jon btw

[4:55:04] tronicmighty1: I haven’t gotten beta access so how is it?? I’m still trying to figure out which expansion I should invest into TWW or cata
[4:56:11] ashtin2220: they should have adapted and put the runes in dungeons
[4:56:31] wigglinjigglin: just give more exp for runes. Questing is simply not engaging content. Combined with amount of time wasted auto running its a complete waste of time.
[4:56:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Scarlet Monastery was packed
[4:56:35] Wulfgrym: you can't quest when there are 90000000 players in each zone
[4:56:46] Roaringkittylol: We work real jobs, have familys, responsibilities... cant spend 3 months level as I want to get the runes and try end game raid. Faster to just bang out the leveling asap, then enjoy the runes journey then raid end game/pvp.
[4:56:58] gabrielg1010: oh i tried questing in 2nd day of release in desolace, you spend 2 hr to farm a mob
[4:57:10] im_capy: They seem to focus on a pvp event, and prob hope open world questing will contribute to that too
[4:57:49] bob_the_demon: They gave incentive for questing by give extra gold but it still takes too long

[4:59:55] coldhandsbeatz: they can adjust dungeon exp and up quest exp. why would it be dead if now questing is quicker than what dungeon was before
[4:59:55] Bulgogiprince: I thought they said they weren't going to do it since the goal of SoD isn't the leveling experience but the extra things to discover in the game.
[5:00:05] tlsmith3638: @im_capy how many time have we seen blizz changed things to anit fun
[5:00:46] im_capy: @tlsmith3638 with toys and stuff, a lot, everything else not so much

[5:05:46] combobulous: quality
[5:06:08] love_eggplant: @stdrbowden no s4 is coming may
[5:06:32] combobulous: Was armor spec in Cata or did it come in MoP?

[5:08:39] ChokingVictimSMT: Goblin shaman inc Pog
[5:08:46] rammeth: thought you got it at 20 but guess not
[5:08:58] ItsDerpDiggler: Yep, most of us hated when they changed the talent trees... It just oversimplified things into a mindless skill choice set lol
[5:08:59] Kayonne: I miss the times were the mob levels were not dynamic like nowadays.
[5:09:07] stdrbowden: when cata comes out, do you think ill still be able to solo heal 25 man heroic as a pala or priest still ?
[5:09:10] moofia1980: Who is your Daddy, and what does hje do ?
[5:09:17] tronicmighty1: I’m probably gonna be a goblin mages but boost him since I already have a mages to 80s lol
[5:09:35] prestilo: you think cata will be succesfull?
[5:10:11] Alcaeus_: Is priest in cata the "new" atonement style or is it still the old heal and shield?
[5:10:18] ChokingVictimSMT: @itsderpdiggler it was definitely simpler but most ppl just picked what a guide told them either way
[5:10:26] tronicmighty1: will they still censored garrosh “quote” in cata like they censored him in retail lol??
[5:10:27] aleck1776: Now thats a horde shield

[5:31:35] theszoti: classic leveling is fun for the first time
[5:31:36] combobulous: questing was such a QOL in Cata, didnt feel bad, unlike every expansion before it
[5:31:39] flebbooo: Atleast now people can't argue that its removed since they still got their era realms
[5:31:45] Clery69: Collect 10 bones with 0,1% drop chance.

[5:32:20] Maydie6066: there you go, they can announce all the layoffs at blizzcon 2024 lol
[5:32:24] Wulfgrym: i doubt there will be anymore blizzcons
[5:32:49] theszoti: the biggest problem with cata leveling is that it is really outdated now on retail
[5:32:54] Sentexqt: oh damn, maybe Ill go for the LuLu LUL
[5:32:58] HooDGorE: stoping blizzcon would be such a bad PR move for microsoft
[5:33:24] death_cam_: didnt microsoft also have the survival game cancelled etc aswell
[5:33:45] ambiotic: Election Year too, so cant see em doing the first week of November like normal.
[5:33:56] Wulfgrym: @HooDGorE question is, is it efficient money wise
[5:34:06] im_capy: They got OPenAi to focus on
[5:34:12] ChokingVictimSMT: What would this years blizzcon even cover? I doubt they spend the money on it when there's nothing big to announce
[5:34:18] kinetico9768: Did MS announce wow comming to game pass?
[5:34:44] HooDGorE: @Wulfgrym when you take into account the positive PR and the opportunity to share other xbox info yes I bet it could be
[5:34:49] combobulous: Didnt microsoft come out and say they lose almost 200$ per xbox series x? they dont care about PR lol. Money loss isnt in there brains
[5:34:50] love_eggplant: smart move, announce 3xpacs before layoff
[5:34:51] SadPandaCake: Starcraft 3!
[5:35:01] zakare232: @SadPandaCake COPIUM
[5:35:04] Wulfgrym: i felt since they bought them, microsoft is just going to absorb them into their whole, they own it, its no longer a seperate entity
[5:35:06] bicarbxd: Announce MoP
[5:35:08] bicarbxd: KEKW
[5:35:14] dracullus: Midnight still can get big features reveal, but that's more for 2026
[5:35:18] HooDGorE: if they come in and gut Blizz they will never recover just like Activision never did after they bought blizzard
[5:35:27] dracullus: 2025 I mean
[5:35:28] death_cam_: did you see the overwatch x cowboy beepbop crossover trailer? it looks so good but sad knowing the skins will be 70 dollar bundle
[5:35:29] avatarcoolton: This grizzly hills music slaps
[5:35:32] Clery69: I wish
[5:35:53] Wulfgrym: @HooDGorE pretty sure blizzcon is dead but we will see, its microsoft collective, not blizzard on its own
[5:36:10] love_eggplant: doesnt that xpac come out in 2025 lol
[5:36:21] Jango_: yuck
[5:36:24] gimmlay: 2024
[5:36:26] HooDGorE: @Wulfgrym just a shame
[5:36:31] theszoti: they are aiming for an early 2026 for midnight, so they might do a big features announcment in early 2025 aswell
[5:36:41] Wulfgrym: they laid off the entire blizzcon staff, seems prety clear to me
[5:36:45] Sicknessqt: I like how 12.0 is called midnight LUL
[5:37:04] Wulfgrym: @HooDGorE i get it, but this is how mergers work, the company owns them, its there product now
[5:37:30] rbgdev: I’m gonna be 40 by the time this saga finishes
[5:37:32] rbgdev: lord

[5:38:13] HooDGorE: @Wulfgrym doesn't mean we cant criticize.
[5:38:16] Wulfgrym: why pay double to advertise their announcements, its now xbox announcements not blizzard announcments

[5:41:08] aleck1776: Nah he needs to learn to swim
[5:41:10] im_capy: Minecraft - "Combining all sales, the game has generated around $3 billion until 2021"

[5:42:24] Zeppyy: sneaky boi
[5:42:24] ambiotic: Cause Fifa makes all the money
[5:42:29] SrntTV: Have they updated achivements to be account wide or does it look to remain for MoP?
[5:42:43] PigPenLen: i started levelling in shadowlands last night for some reason and was shocked at how populated it was
[5:42:45] bicarbxd: what im afraid of is that they start increasing subscribtion price, it hasnt changed since 2006
[5:42:51] combobulous: Microsofts largest source of revenue lastyear was Office with 44.9B in 2023 i think
[5:42:55] wigglinjigglin: From some random website "Specifically for WoW, it has been reported that the game has generated a total of $9.23 billion in revenue for Blizzard since its launch."
[5:43:19] lil_jay_jay123: @Towelliee do you play any other games besides World Of Warcraft?

[6:09:19] oilerr: gnomer barely has any upgrades imo, that's a big issue. in bfd everything was a huge upgrade. i hope blizz learns from that and does better ST loot @Towelliee

[6:09:49] Kaykerrs: it was ridiculous
[6:09:56] Molvonos: I mean.
[6:10:00] oilerr: i mean lloot from bfd to gnomer isnt huge, bfd loot was so good

[6:12:55] oilerr: @TheRonWeedsley I mean ofc gnomer gear is upgrade but when I looked at bfd gear on atlas I was excited from 0 spell power to 10 spell power gear, now I dont when I see 2 sp upgrade, thats what I mean
