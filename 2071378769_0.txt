[0:37:19] DCBen: good luck
[0:37:24] DCBen: doesnt work 50% of the games LUL
[0:37:30] strengthofathousndmen: add the name of any macro u want to be dynamic into the addon, first line will always be @healer, second line will always be @dps
[0:37:51] strengthofathousndmen: like /cast [@dynamicmacro] intervene - this will be healer if its first line in your macro
[0:37:52] eX1stnZ_: I think you gotta read the documentation, it says it in red Kappa
[0:38:23] strengthofathousndmen: leave first line empty if u want it to only be dps with
[0:38:34] strengthofathousndmen: like if its a bind without modifiers (alts, shift etc)
[0:38:48] nikzyyy: the whazzler SillyChamp
[0:38:51] strengthofathousndmen: then you go /cast [@dynamicmacro]
[0:38:52] strengthofathousndmen: first line
[0:39:03] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz
[0:39:17] strengthofathousndmen: then second line /cast [@dynamicmacro] sanc
[0:39:23] strengthofathousndmen: yeah
[0:39:38] strengthofathousndmen: obviously full name yes
[0:39:59] strengthofathousndmen: now add "DPS SANC" into the addon /dm
[0:40:10] strengthofathousndmen: then your first line will just be /cast [@dynamicmacro] sanc
[0:40:13] strengthofathousndmen: thats it
[0:40:45] v1cettw: BlizzCon pog
[0:40:47] Matzefyr: 9 ads?? comeon bro, you ordering burgir tonight? This is outrageous. You have lost a long time viewer and supporter.
[0:40:47] v1cettw: how
[0:41:05] Alegral: if you think about its crazy that you can´t custmozime something like this macro in game without any need of addons
[0:41:05] Moobot: Don't forget to follow my Twitter to see when I go live! https://twitter.com/Whaazz
[0:41:33] strengthofathousndmen: then it should work, can check in skirmish
[0:41:34] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[0:42:05] strengthofathousndmen: if its fine - in arena your macro will change from @dynamicmacro to their actual name
[0:42:15] strengthofathousndmen: ye
[0:43:31] casper24411442: freedom
[0:43:32] dimsanx: freedom
[0:43:54] strengthofathousndmen: for healer you just do 1 line in macro. first line will always be healer, thats why this line is empty for dps
[0:44:15] sanestivikesti: doesnt framesort support just @dps and @healer macros
[0:44:24] relegod1: just get party sort addon so healer is always p1 and dps p2
[0:44:41] strengthofathousndmen: you just do: #showtooltip      /cast [@dynamicmacro] whatever the spell is
[0:44:45] strengthofathousndmen: yeye
[0:45:26] skystepx: what is this Dynamicmacro thing
[0:45:34] sanestivikesti: i think framesort would solve this easier
[0:45:45] strengthofathousndmen: yezzir
[0:46:34] Ellsherlock: Yeah framesort handles all that
[0:46:34] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[0:46:36] strengthofathousndmen: yeah it should change all your macros to names of dps and healers
[0:46:40] strengthofathousndmen: in arena
[0:46:44] ripgodzx: why not just use arena 1 2 3 ?
[0:47:02] sanestivikesti: but framesort supports @role macros right?
[0:47:04] Ellsherlock: it will handle them whether you anchor certain roles/party1-2-3. The macro takes that into account
[0:47:25] DCBen: wrong weapon
[0:47:28] DCBen: get legendary LUL
[0:47:29] strengthofathousndmen: queue skirmish before you go in shuffle with all these binds
