[1:41:33] Aggressive_Pear: I started in Cata. I miss deepholm.
[1:41:35] capitan_3steban: At the end of the xpac the rep grind is minimal now too
[1:41:37] caboose1029: bring it bakc for season 4. give us all the bowered power
[1:41:47] TheCliffyShow: As a rogue, I'm hoping for Flagellation.
[1:41:54] MagnaDracomon: @jerexify none atm sincei have to start over
[1:42:02] Mecabeast: 20 max corruption tanks with td was sooooo much fun in nyalotha
[1:42:02] capitan_3steban: I started in Vanilla - yep I'm old.
[1:42:11] MagnaDracomon: @jerexify so if you'll have me just tell me if YOU are h or a
[1:42:41] Aggressive_Pear: I remember watching my dad level his paladin through westfall.
[1:42:42] jerexify: @MagnaDracomon Well, if you decide to go Alliance, Zeroes to Heroes on Stormrage is a really good guild that is always recruiting. They're a sister guild to Death Jesters, which is where Towelliee used to raid, and he's how I found out about ZtH in the first place.
[1:42:48] snake_like: flag has grown on me. bone spike is nice too since we don't really have any two mob cleave except outlaw.

[1:43:13] capitan_3steban: I've never really played Alliance - after all these years
[1:43:18] MagnaDracomon: @jerexify alrighty thanks for the tip, I'll consider it
[1:43:25] Niksen_99: Will you go Dwarf again if there is cross faction ?
[1:43:26] CozzyFlannel: i thought season 4 was 9.2.5
[1:43:27] FrankTizzle: Yea, 9.2.5 should be out in the next few weeks
[1:43:33] stubbedub: @Towelliee when do you predict the alpha to start launching?
[1:43:35] magemaster225: I still want to know if you can get AOTC in S4
[1:43:37] ArcaneSyntax: I thought this was always the plan lol
[1:43:45] pavepawns: are the youtube news related to the mobile stuff or Wow?
[1:43:45] snake_like: 9.2.5 appears to be coupled with season 4
[1:43:46] Mistery836: I love the cross faction play
[1:43:46] pavepawns: or both?
[1:43:47] Mistery836: FINALY
[1:43:55] kappaday23: next few weeks Kappa
[1:44:00] ClassicMalcontent: #Stone_LX9 I am levelling my Alliance Druid now in SL. Just came back. Next my Horde Paladin.
[1:44:10] ClassicMalcontent: I like seeing both.
[1:44:13] capitan_3steban: Nice bro!
[1:44:14] Mattsta: I'm hoping 9.2.5 comes significantly before season 4
[1:44:15] Korupcija_: well they did nerf the raid really quick this time
[1:44:18] Aggressive_Pear: Cross faction is going to be awesome. All my toons are alliance and my friends all played horde.
[1:44:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Seasons are usually like 6 months, I heard
[1:44:33] capitan_3steban: I'll have to try out a Ally guy - just to see how the other side lives. Ha!
[1:44:42] smashwow: the 3 month seasons we had at the beginning of legion was too short,
[1:45:03] Jewishraver: i really want account bound gold lol. i have so much gold throughout all my toons lol
[1:45:03] FrankTizzle: FeelsBadMan
[1:45:07] Aggressive_Pear: That would suck lol
[1:45:09] Mitchendo64: worse they play with warmode on
[1:45:09] smashwow: seasons should probably be around 120-150 days

[1:45:31] Sollice: @Towelliee stop
[1:45:32] yunitoYuniro: Any date on that new patch crossfaction th8ng?
[1:45:33] Mistery836: well. the cross faction is gonna be better in terms of dungeon queue (I hope)
[1:45:35] Niksen_99: Will you go Dwarf again when cross faction? @Towelliee
[1:45:38] Sollice: Do the friendly ZM one for 226
[1:45:43] Delkamus04: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:45:53] Sollice: Do the friendly ZM one for 226
[1:45:54] IDspud: i do the friendly ZM one too
[1:46:01] MagnaDracomon: tbh if i can get some of my friends to paly when crossfaction stuff lands, its gonna matter less which races we pick rather than if we want to be in the same guild
[1:46:05] markymarc84: Tell me what's your rep if your rep sign if you can get the 226 Strata Way
[1:46:13] MistaHat: Yeah, it's weird but at least you can raid mythic on the same server, just a little annoying to invite peeps
[1:46:14] Aggressive_Pear: If dwarves don't get a buff to their racials in 10.0 I am going to cry :'(
[1:46:15] ThatGuyFayde: @Towelliee do you know if the death jesters GM still streams?
[1:46:24] Menion01: If only Everquest 1 had figured cross faction guilds, raiding and grouping out 20+ years ago.
[1:46:27] Korupcija_: ye, this is just band aid for pugging
[1:46:47] astral_kingdom: can't you just do the vendor there in mortis instead of getting that one first?
[1:46:59] Mitchendo64: i think xfaction guilds will be a thing in 10.0
[1:47:04] MagnaDracomon: like i'll be the first to admit i'm furry trash and love my vulpera and tauren, but alliance has worgen and draenei soooo
[1:47:09] LspN: Is alliance really that dead? :P
[1:47:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: That will help the DPS meter
[1:47:21] captivate7: check the zm vendor for conduits too @Towelliee
[1:47:22] InsaneToons: the enlightened rep at friendly lets you buy 226 ones
[1:47:29] Aggressive_Pear: Literally useless racial traits on dwarves. What deals frost damage in SL? +no archeology
[1:47:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: necrotic wake last boss
[1:47:59] PvtHudson093: didnt you just miss a conduit socket out?
[1:48:06] capitan_3steban: do racial traits really matter tho??
[1:48:19] JediNeo99999: stoneform is great

[1:49:20] IDspud: goodluck!!!
[1:49:20] snake_like: damn I just realizes there's gonna be new dracthyr racials
[1:49:21] ClassicMalcontent: @Aggressive_Pear Archeology was clearly let go when it was the only profession not changed in BfA. They left it at what like 925 or whatever skill and not per-expansion like the others? Sounds like no plans since then and none mentioned for Dragonflight so that's that.
[1:49:28] IDspud: i hope ya get a teir
[1:49:45] capitan_3steban: The dragons can only be the new class I think

[2:38:59] CrusaderNero: need a mode below LFR tbh
[2:39:01] 91Niki: OMEGALUL
[2:39:16] Mitchendo64: good ol casual player toxic community in lfr
[2:39:16] Brodih_: small steps

[2:39:27] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they're 12
[2:39:39] Aggressive_Pear: I loved doing my dailies back in late wrath. Learning the ins and outs of mounted combat, getting my own squire, it was something you could work towards instead of rng
[2:39:46] chrslp: @Towelliee Northman worth seeing? I only saw you said it was like Vikings

[2:39:49] Tokies: This boss on LFR is a nightmare. I did it on heroic and it was easier.
[2:39:53] Troniin: the one thing I dread about wrath is having to deal with hit and expertise cap again. also not looking forward to level weapon skills
[2:40:00] Sylphy_TV: zekeTHINK

[2:40:52] darssia_: think this is worse than nzoth lfr?
[2:41:09] dimofodi: If you hit your pet attack...
[2:41:13] Aggressive_Pear: I remember switching to hunter and mhy pet kept attacking things lol
[2:41:20] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  Blizz should just add tier to this boss as drops and people would actually show interest with doing him.  I have come across players that have zero interest with doing him.
[2:41:28] Snabido: Sheep kicking Kappa
[2:41:31] OigreSier: @annassae nah

[2:57:09] daniel85mg: Do LRF bosses give Rep if u killed on a higher difficulty?
[2:57:15] Clockwerk_Industries: there should be a mechanics test needed for LFR like you have to do a series of mechanics trials and have a certain ilvl
[2:57:35] akia03: @MinimalCode only 1 time rep per boss
[2:57:41] Clockwerk_Industries: hahahhaa
[2:57:52] JustAwaay: trial of patience

[2:57:56] TacDuc: "Jailers forces subdued 6%" Literally just killed the jailer
[2:58:02] onous_: Normal is easier then lfr.

[2:58:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked the proving grounds, yeah
[2:58:17] volkreig: What time is announcement tomorrow @Towelliee
[2:58:18] onous_: I enjoyed proving grounds.
[2:58:28] Atokiri: it helped a lot of people to learn their roles. Thats true
[2:58:38] Merkuriuz: it wont work
[2:58:41] Velashen: They were great and should be brought back.
[2:58:47] Merkuriuz: people will still be shit geared
[2:58:48] McconnelI: thats like removing normal now?
[2:58:48] ironfist625: I do it if I’m trying to learn healing or tanking still
[2:58:49] onous_: It would save them time and money.
[2:58:54] Mecabeast: they should get a solo mode strictly for story purposes

[2:59:03] ruhroraggy: your first video?
[2:59:09] ChieveMoe: Is mobile wow going to actually be an attempt at a legit game, will it be the same game or its own

[2:59:18] Snabido: @Mecabeast Now that's just antisocial 👀
[2:59:22] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Any thoughts on them taking out Dungeon finder matchmaking from wrath classic?
[2:59:34] Aidler: but normal also in parts with 3 bosses per part
[2:59:34] CrunkyBrewster: it'll be a shitstorm if they made Normal Queued. people just have this bad impression of LFR regardless. Even peopel who dont even touch LFR which is dumb im sorry

[3:00:05] CozzyFlannel: Did we down jailer
[3:00:15] CrunkyBrewster: big mistake agreed
[3:00:38] DeeGibz: That alone made me not want to play it.  Idk, Im a casual andy though
[3:00:42] onous_: By them making normal quable it doesn't mean you have to.
[3:00:56] dkapocalypse: how about just bring back normal and heroic raiding and kill lfr and mythic raiding lol
[3:01:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Original Wrath didn't have the dungeon finder at the start but it was added later, doing that again would be okay
[3:01:16] Rabbi19: Wait did I hear that right? They are taking out the dungeon finder for wrath?

[3:01:35] hey__wild: they can add dungeon finder back in before release
[3:01:36] TombStoneMercenary: IMHO its going to create even more gatekeeping that already is there in classic!
[3:01:41] techjunkey: They can always add it in later
[3:01:44] flickrmbskull: when I 1st played wow and svsn 1st started playing wow classic on release there was no dungeon finder was all zone lol
[3:01:48] cabalish: towOny
[3:01:59] CrunkyBrewster: I think they dont wanna do it because they know ppl will farm the living hell out of the Badge gear easier with LFD

[3:02:29] Rabbi19: Well that sucks for me. I guess I won’t be playing. All my friends play horde but I like alli so I just haven’t played anything yet waiting for it to come to wrath.
[3:02:30] CrunkyBrewster: I can see their reasoning behind it really
[3:02:33] Brodih_: will they release with the new mix of races and classes also?
[3:02:38] CrunkyBrewster: yeah just make LFD for Normals. AGreed
[3:02:39] Rictamar: @Crunku_ then should just put a weekly cap in
[3:02:40] Niksen_99: No Dungeon Finder because blizzard is going to sell lots of Level boosts !
[3:02:46] CrunkyBrewster: make Heroics non queue. Done

[3:03:42] CritcobainTV: Did u get any tier? @Towelliee
[3:03:45] CrunkyBrewster: Classisc Andys did what? Just spammed Dungeons to 60. But told everyone to "Enjoy the journey"
[3:03:55] CritcobainTV: FeelsBadMan
[3:03:58] TheCliffyShow: The loudest and angriest always get heard. Even if their stupid.
[3:04:15] onous_: Imagine having to actually having to talk to ppl to form a dungeon group. It's like ppl dating these days. Without a fuck anytime app ppl have no idea how to ask someone out in person.
[3:04:15] the_tavern_dwarf: Need to go @towelliee seeya maybe tomorrow
[3:04:19] Streamcrush: not just spammed dungeons to 60, spammed dungeons by powerleveling
[3:04:23] Rictamar: its a huge mistake to not have an LFD, wrath classic is dead on arrival lol

[3:04:43] Mecabeast: except friends didn't want to quest till 60 lmao
[3:04:47] TombStoneMercenary: The biggest argument over dungeon finder in wrath classic is that people say it ruins the community, but are also the same ones that pay for dungeons boosts while they watch netflix!!!

[3:07:22] SSD511_: Wotlk was my first time I ever raid before that just spamming av 24/7 LUL
[3:07:25] Mecabeast: attunements were a stopping point probably
[3:07:26] Tavoot: LK was a little tough
[3:07:26] Mitune: Wotlk is a great expansion for building classic + imo

[3:07:29] CrunkyBrewster: ICC Dungeons
[3:07:30] Niksen_99: FeelsBadMan can imagine @jasperboy
[3:07:36] Melonbrew: I loved wrath dungeons
[3:07:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: ulduar better release like a month after naxx, i farmed naxx way to long in classic, its the reverse of what happened orginally
[3:07:38] Mitchendo64: cause you only got 50 attempts per week in raids
[3:07:42] Clockwerk_Industries: I loved wrath
[3:07:42] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i was able to tank as frost dk dps for heroics lol it was gr8
[3:07:45] EvilStreak: and thats what they need right now
[3:07:55] dkapocalypse: plus death knights
[3:07:57] Stealinheals: there was a weekly % buff for icc to help people get through because it was too hard
[3:08:00] Zettabyte: I miss the ICC dance offs, @Towelliee FeelsBadMan
[3:08:02] CrunkyBrewster: Amen
[3:08:04] Stangin2122: Anyone know why there is a queue to get into Battlenet?
[3:08:08] Vendralos: Spam chat for 1 hour to put together a group is just not good.
[3:08:11] MILESkg21: DK arenas KEKW Clap best shit ever
[3:08:18] mmrghost7: all dungs will be 4 DKs plus a healer
[3:08:18] Mitchendo64: clearly they didnt enjoy it if we are asking for LFD to be removed
[3:08:19] CrunkyBrewster: INDEED
[3:08:28] CrunkyBrewster: FacedRolling all night long. Lets Go
[3:08:32] ILikeKillTheZombies: wotlk DK starting zone quests will take hours to do
[3:08:33] Niksen_99: Dungeon finder was first added near Cataclysm anyway right ?

[3:08:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: i didnt ask for shit
[3:08:49] Digglio: LFD was part of WotLK though...
[3:08:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looks like in Wrath that DK's will likely have to tank in Blood spec, a bit of a letdown because I liked Frost and Unholy tanking

[3:09:10] CrunkyBrewster: it was part of Wrath, but not really til the last patch if I recall right.
[3:09:12] Bigjimbo32: anyone have any information on wowmobile I can't really find anything on game play or anything.
[3:09:12] race_out: @Niksen_99 it was added in 3.3
[3:09:15] ijuki: With 4chan you actually get feedback compared to the classic subreddit Kappa
[3:09:24] Scoodles91: reddit shouldt ecist in the firstplace
[3:09:25] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee Confirming Ion goes to 4chan for CLassic feedback
[3:09:26] srs_business: I do think Cata classic will happen, and I feel ideally you want to have all eras of the game accessible eventually
[3:09:28] CrunkyBrewster: but they're suppose to be basing Classic Wrath on the last patch.
[3:09:33] CrunkyBrewster: Yeah
[3:09:47] Kneckt: yah i didnt agree with ion saying "you can do that in shadowlands" ,well you still will be able to leave mid group in wrath without the LFD so it isnt gonna change shit lol its a bad idea to remove it

They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[3:09:54] greywind317: They should have gave us demon hunters for bc Classic this time around
[3:09:58] CrunkyBrewster: those were the only heroics I recall wiping in on occasion
[3:10:03] race_out: halls of reflection was the hardest 5 man in wrath lol
[3:10:08] Snabido: Idk what's worse: Pit of Saron back in wrath, or timewalking version (when it just did absurd dmg output) PepeHands
[3:10:10] Kneckt: i think cata+ will
[3:10:12] GamerKillance: Cata clkassic? Ew
[3:10:16] Kneckt: cata with major changes
[3:10:18] techjunkey: I am hoping they get creative with Season of Mastery
[3:10:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: I ran Pit of Saron a ton for a good weapon to PvP with....it's alright
[3:10:26] CrunkyBrewster: especially the Arthas Dungeon where you had to fight those waves
[3:10:26] srs_business: The thing is, if you don't do Cata classic what do you do in it's stead
[3:10:27] vireosgaming: legion classic maybe?
[3:10:29] NBK_Sethus: Cata more or less ended 'classic' WoW lol
[3:10:31] dracullus: funny that all 3 still had less bosses than megadungeon
[3:10:32] coeebra: do you think its going to be a wrath classic plus?
[3:10:33] GamerKillance: They need seasonal servers for the first three. If they do that then WoW will JUMP in subscribers
[3:10:36] TheCliffyShow: Battle for Azeroth Classic.
[3:10:39] Eraste: time for some classic + nodders
[3:10:42] CrunkyBrewster: Vintage?
[3:10:46] PartyHatGladOS: I'd rather them do something new post lich king instead of going down that wild ride of escalating threats with lose and fast lore ignoring/retcon cata mop etc.
[3:10:50] Verrekk: old school wow XD
[3:10:53] InsaneToons: you think they'll just make servers for the diff expansions instead of seperate clients?
[3:10:53] race_out: idk i think it's fair to interpret classic as up to MoP
[3:10:54] Looma: reforged? LUL
[3:10:59] Im_a_sad_man: Shadowlands classic gonna be great LUL
[3:11:00] Ezekyler: Reforged Kappa
[3:11:01] Vendralos: Cata Reforged PepeLaugh
[3:11:01] Stealinheals: wrath is still classic, after that no
[3:11:03] CrunkyBrewster: Oh no PepeLaugh
[3:11:03] kirtyalex: Legion classic LUL
[3:11:07] Zettabyte: Cata: Remake Kappa
[3:11:13] CrunkyBrewster: Legion Redux
[3:11:18] kjdocs: I don't really think cata is modern.
[3:11:18] TheKitsuneAdventures: wow 2.0  lol
[3:11:22] mmrghost7: still w8ing on 11.0 classic
[3:11:23] Zettabyte: Reforged? LOL
[3:11:29] andari_dragon: cata the fuckering
[3:11:30] LawnSpeaker: They should just switch to accelerated progression servers
[3:11:39] Velashen: The memes would be too much  if cata classic came out. Terrible
[3:11:47] CanadianCataclysm: Just make all the xpacks at there last patch and have servers.. if people play on them they do.. if they dont they dont.. Merge servers as they get low pop
[3:11:48] PisSeProphett: "Deathwing - Electric Boogaloo"!!! you heard it first here mates. Shout out to Ozone and other pop-lockers
[3:11:55] TheCliffyShow: Cataclysm: Reshattered Edition
[3:12:02] srs_business: Because if you just stop at Wrath you'd either have to basically make a new expansion or just keep running progression servers (with minor changes) for base/TBC/Wrath forever
[3:12:16] TheCliffyShow: Cataclysm: Revenge of Spine of Deathwing
[3:12:20] PartyHatGladOS: cataclysm "this time we let steve write it" and its just season 8 game of thrones point for point
[3:12:20] onous_: They should have did all these relaunches using the newer unreal engine.
[3:12:30] race_out: i want classic MoP though
[3:12:35] race_out: :(
[3:12:40] Stealinheals: after that do progression servers and start classic plus
[3:12:41] srs_business: same
[3:12:47] Streamcrush: Either keep relaunching old expansions, or create something new. That's all they can do.
[3:12:51] Dyriks: aw man my neck is killing me today
[3:12:51] Shrenko: easy money for Blizz
[3:12:52] Lupine_Fury: well, just skip cata and launch a MoP
[3:12:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: they will keep alternating season of mastery for each of them
[3:12:56] onous_: Nobody wants cata, that's when the game changed.
[3:13:14] LawnSpeaker: @streamcrush why not both?
[3:13:14] bashingsticks: I would love a MOP classic!
[3:13:19] coeebra: do you think theyre going to make new dungeos/raids with the old style?
[3:13:19] ChieveMoe: Will there be a classic Pandaria?
[3:13:22] Draz3nx: do a lot of people really play classic wow
[3:13:23] InsaneToons: so are they going to have realm first achievments in wrath classic? i know they took them out because of unhalthy gameplay
[3:13:24] Hitokiri83: wod classic now with missing content
[3:13:25] srs_business: I don't want Cata, but MoP is the only thing that would make me play classic
[3:13:30] tetrahydridodinitrogen: Not even WoD?
[3:13:31] kjdocs: while i wasn't a huge fan of cata, i'm sure many liked the raids.
[3:13:34] techjunkey: they all had potential
[3:13:36] TheCliffyShow: Worgens and Goblins
[3:13:37] techjunkey: some just didn't' deliver
[3:13:47] Henke1983: didn't ion answer that in asmon interveiw
[3:13:48] Atokiri: cata dungeons were hardcore, but i loved that
[3:13:53] MrGrimms: MrGrimms subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! another month down, more streams to go towHype
[3:13:53] GamerKillance: Cata was great for new players when they REDID the entire freaking world. End game was kinda trash
[3:14:00] Strange_Inquiries: Weirdly, I loved WoD
[3:14:02] ChieveMoe: Actually makes me happy seeing people wanting to play MoP Classic. Loved that xpac
[3:14:05] Mitune: If they do Cata + "classic" that might work but itd take a lot to make Cata bring back people
[3:14:06] bosseja: felipe_bosseljon_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! I'm back baby! good to see playing WOW Tow
[3:14:25] TheCliffyShow: Some of the questing zones were great to. Mount Hyjai, Uldum, Twilight Highlands.
[3:14:25] koko316: You missed my 128 resub

[3:14:37] Cafe0le: top pvers and pvpers want mop
[3:14:49] PartyHatGladOS: classic blizzard strategy really
[3:14:49] Streamcrush: @LawnSpeaker honestly, because it causes too much fragmentation of dev time, money, playerbase, etc. And eventually the "classic" crowd is going to dwindle so much the upkeep won't be worth it.
[3:14:51] Stealinheals: healing at start of cata blizz had the idea of trating healing as "triage" and it was hard as shit
[3:14:53] tekfury: thats when I found you doing dungeon guides
[3:14:59] LilleM00: And there will be problems xD
[3:15:02] ClassicMalcontent: No need for anything after WotLK for 'classic'. Cata is basically 'current retail' for most intents and purposes. Just IMHO of course.
[3:15:02] TheCliffyShow: Hell, I didn't mind Vash'jir or whatever it was called. Deepholm sucked though.

[3:15:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would like to do a Classic MoP
[3:16:11] onous_: @towelliee   Do you think Blizzard should open up a little and out source side content like player housing and tying lore back into current story?
[3:16:14] bosseja: Got the new hammer pog
[3:16:20] Mitune: a cata + might tho
[3:16:22] Draz3nx: wrath will
[3:16:27] Im_a_sad_man: Just skip cata LUL
[3:16:28] ClassicMalcontent: @ChieveMoe the entire world changed at Cataclysm and onward. So no. I see no point. Others? Fine. I think anything Cata+ would flop as "Classic"
[3:16:28] TheCliffyShow: It's Children's Week. Trying to remember if I need anymore of the pets.
[3:16:46] CrunkyBrewster: LUL YUP
[3:16:54] race_out: i started playing in wrath but i loved classic too

[3:17:03] GamerKillance: 2005 WoW baby for myself. Played when a lot of the talent stuff was fixed
[3:17:05] Rabbi19: As a PvP player I would like cata again.
[3:17:07] CrunkyBrewster: that was how it was for me. started in early TBC, raided in Wrath
[3:17:18] ILikeKillTheZombies: imagine if they make lvling longer in wrath like some posts on classic subreddit were saying
[3:17:19] Armdel: back in wrath it felt like everyone i knew was playing wow
[3:17:20] pavepawns: id rather mop
[3:17:22] ILikeKillTheZombies: :D
[3:17:41] darssia_: even my non wow friends are talking about wrath classic.
[3:17:48] Niksen_99: TBC classic got like 300k people raiding and even more preparing for WOTLK.. its going to be huge
[3:17:52] Im_a_sad_man: Ulduar is still one the best raids ever made.
[3:17:54] Henke1983: dungeons in mop was boring af
[3:18:03] ClassicMalcontent: I enjoyed Cataclysm and beyond but never cared for the entire world changes of the OLD ORIGINAL WOW zones. I wish they would have Chromie allow us IN RETAIL to view the ORIGINAL WoW zones.
[3:18:03] Aidler: and experience the wrathgate event that was removed later
[3:18:06] ChieveMoe: @ClassicMalcontent Ah i see your point, fair play and well said
[3:18:07] CrunkyBrewster: I know my youngest brother is talkling about coming back to Wrath. And he's a Vanilla baby
[3:18:44] Shrenko: @TheCliffyShow go on simplearmory
[3:18:48] Atokiri: challenge version of the dungeons were a big point for MoP but the raids and pvp feel good, THrone of thunder was goooood
[3:19:00] bogv: !wowmobile

[3:21:11] im_n0t_jezus: and spend money IF u want to

[3:22:37] kappaday23: Keepo
[3:22:47] masterlee05: so if Towellie said its in warcraft universe that means rts or clash of clans copy
[3:22:53] CritcobainTV: WoW mobile is gonna be all about those pet battles Kappa
[3:22:58] falldrgn: Battle royale
[3:23:03] dracullus: they won't skip pc version just few  days after they won some people with immortal on battlenet
[3:23:13] Gage4Gaming: @masterlee05 no it means a warcraft game that uses the warcraft IP
[3:23:22] Eraste: they should have announced the mobile game before dragonflight, im sure people would have liked that Kappa

[3:23:59] Gage4Gaming: @masterlee05 sure i bet its a gacha game
[3:24:27] GamerKillance: They're bringing it to PC because China isn't allowing it to come to their country. The ban on ALL NEW GAMES is hurting all those companies. They have to apply to other people now
[3:24:27] masterlee05: so noob question if tomorrow will be the anouncement we won't be able to play the game?
[3:24:40] masterlee05: @gage4gaming 100% not a gatcha that's a crap genere
[3:24:58] DutDuck: thats cool how do you feell that you impacted a whole ass platform like thatr

[4:44:21] Mistery836: I am all for master loot in a guild setting. but there shouldn't be an ability to turn it on in pugs
[4:44:27] XshadowturkeyX: i feel like they should bring back masterloot for created grps like guilds and not pugs give the option of masterloot but drop loot for only the classes in the raid and then have pugs use personal loot but you can trade it regardless if its a upgrade or not
[4:44:33] Kneckt: yea

[4:45:48] dj_goasoul: diablo immortal should be fine on mobile department, its something u can play after all
[4:45:52] jason_shade: what those games do'nt have going for them is a built in playerbase, you just treat the pokemon go game as a mini game which gets you stuff in wow

[5:22:49] thiccsushi: Liquid has yoinked from pieces plenty before LUL

[5:44:03] rhonins: yeah moneu pressure is too high
[5:44:07] rhonins: money*
[5:44:10] OldManChickenLegs: What about wow mobile what’s the deets
[5:44:14] tetrahydridodinitrogen: Didnt echo say they spent 50k on the race?
[5:44:39] The_Mail_Man__: @tetrahydridodinitrogen equivalent to 50k for their gold purchases
[5:44:45] rhonins: they need to put BiS vendor and focus only on Mythic race
[5:44:48] duffluv22: Competition is good though. No one will just one or 2 guilds every raid...lol
[5:44:54] dizzlethebot: Destiny used to do world first races pretty well
[5:44:58] Nokterian: Sponsors want digits
[5:45:06] rhonins: this heroic grind is just too much and note very interesting anyway
[5:45:07] Exxcar: I mean that's unlreal expectations from SK then
[5:45:08] Nokterian: you dont have the digits it is the end for you
[5:45:16] SSD511_: Mobile games make huge money some people spend 2k a day
[5:45:18] Nokterian: KEKW
[5:45:20] Blvdman: Do it, Azralon 20+ keys are safe
[5:45:20] Exxcar: Cause like... we've seen the last few tiers be dominated by Echo and Limit
[5:45:20] Moobot: Jollywhompus, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[5:45:22] duffluv22: 21s baby!!!!!!
[5:45:24] 91Niki: Can anyone translate that ?
[5:45:26] 91Niki: sacHMM
[5:45:31] duffluv22: The curse!!!!
[5:45:44] Nokterian: anniesHmm
[5:45:49] Ssrlord: Whats wrong with azralon ?
[5:46:00] Ertra: azralon at that high is pretty safe tho
[5:46:00] manmower: if they want to get viewers and money they have to win
[5:46:04] Nokterian: towCry WHY
[5:46:07] Nokterian: KEKW
[5:46:14] manmower: RWF is a B2W event
[5:46:15] Aro725: You have method as well, They did very good this tier
[5:46:22] duffluv22: I didn't believe it if i didn't see it with my ow eyes...lol
[5:46:32] Exxcar: RWF is a 2 guild race right now
[5:46:32] Aro725: Plus with all the pieces guys needing a new home now, the top 3/4 guilds will be even better
[5:46:32] axellent_x: there's no parity in the rwf, the better players will get absorbed by those who have money. need to start adding a salary cap Kappa
[5:46:34] KodyTheTyger: what even happened to exorsus?
[5:46:42] Lulaboo: YUP
[5:46:48] Two_Headed_Raven: Money destroys everything...
[5:46:51] Nokterian: Top 5 is where it is at
[5:46:54] c0mmander_starscream: "Money talks, Bullshit walks"...
[5:47:02] Exxcar: @Nokterian Not even top 5 nowe
[5:47:03] manmower: RWF should be a separate tournament realm
[5:47:16] Exxcar: Next tier full stop will just be Echo VS Liquid
[5:47:21] gregl__: you still make pennies
[5:47:22] ijuki: @manmower No thanks
[5:47:23] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i do not think other than Liquid/Echo will be able to get first place in RWF ( huge props to BDGG and Method guys) it's just as u said it's huge money and time issue
[5:47:27] gregl__: its not a livable wage
[5:47:30] Lulaboo: Lots of money to be made in the RWF as long as you dont blow a budget. It means grabbing sponsors to pay for the event and the big players have been scooping up guilds
[5:47:44] Nokterian: And to think that many in RWF also have normal jobs and not streaming at all
[5:47:55] crunchyFrog999: WF is serious business Kappa
[5:48:20] Ceekayn_: What addon manager do you use/recommend?
[5:48:21] Aidler: method is not out of the picture
[5:48:23] Maruika: just no one named Josh need apply
[5:48:40] gregl__: @Towelliee you can't live off being in one of those guilds, you have to supplement it with either streaming or a different job
[5:48:45] gregl__: and 95% of them cant make it streaming
[5:48:46] The_Mail_Man__: if u stream and play u make decent money
[5:48:58] Lulaboo: Method will be more competitive next tier
[5:49:07] brewgamingtv: It's a three guild race after method showed they can strong again
[5:49:12] Tokies: true method is back
[5:49:40] gregl__: ft
[5:49:40] Lulaboo: Ft buibbler
[5:49:42] brewgamingtv: yeah
[5:49:44] Lulaboo: bubbler*
[5:49:45] The_Mail_Man__: ftbub
[5:49:51] Rottencoarse: ftbubbler
[5:49:55] Mecabeast: what about fat shark yes?
[5:50:06] Maruika: Imagine thinking its a surprise the bosses make more money
[5:50:12] Lulaboo: fat shark would be first place if they didnt race casually
[5:50:13] duffluv22: People are growing up with more responsibilities. Need to focus on the younger generation to keep RWF going and exciting
[5:50:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna march into my bosses office right now and ask why he makes more than me Kappa
[5:50:15] manmower: tell bubbler to make a stream
[5:50:29] KodyTheTyger: Didn't some of Limit's players literally have to go back to work cuz the race just lasted too long for Sepulcher?
[5:50:45] Jollywhompus: Egaming will continue to evolve from the financial side. There's still a lot of new esports companies still figuring out how to actually manage payrolls and talent acquisition
[5:50:45] Blvdman: China would honestly win every time
[5:50:50] c0mmander_starscream: China FortOne
[5:50:52] Mourningztar: There is so many people
[5:50:53] brewgamingtv: China did good this tier
[5:50:58] manmower: China just has so many damn people
[5:50:58] Dyasis: yeah, NA/EU would never win again
[5:51:01] Aidler: max makes money… what a shock..lol
[5:51:22] Maruika: people in SHanghai have tons of time these days to raid
[5:51:26] duffluv22: Why cant they release globally??
[5:51:26] rymerre: you dont have to pay them cuz they are all gold farmers on the side
[5:51:27] Blvdman: Doesn't China's system have some sort of payment already for people who play games professionally?
[5:51:29] dizzlethebot: Yeah they locked inside of course all they do is play
[5:51:35] xraynibba: prolly why they win so much they actually love the game they play
[5:51:35] vic_ave: of course max and the team make money thats a weird comment
[5:51:45] Aidler: don’t know if China would win outright…. but it would get even more interesting
[5:51:56] reggiepowa: and Aster Kappa

[5:52:14] manmower: i wonder if they would bust RMT in the China region for the event
[5:52:34] willsilvey: Pieces have quit race to world first
[5:53:02] Kneckt: @Fioren no... people get paid like its a job
[5:53:05] brewgamingtv: BDGG kinda flopped this tier

[5:53:09] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i think everyone got broken by the crab not just bdgg
[5:53:11] J_Rich94: how does a video game break you?
[5:53:12] a_bu: Can there be guild that likes to raid all the time but not race?
[5:53:13] ThisIsPita: What's the reasoning for not releasing globally?
[5:53:14] Blvdman: lmao Haladonros gave em that D
[5:53:19] Mecabeast: the memes were good tho
[5:53:27] Nokterian: the crab with a knife is dangerous for sure
[5:53:39] Aidler: what’s the guild sloot is in?
[5:53:41] Sylphy_TV: Diablo Music?
[5:53:43] Zeke_nl: halondrus and jailer killed a lot of guilds it seems
[5:53:55] brewgamingtv: Sloot is in BDGG
[5:53:56] Blvdman: Halondrus: For all those crab jokes and memes, I will avenge
[5:54:06] Gozzy: and that only works if the race goes as long as this, if it's short china gets no chance
[5:54:07] Aidler: uffff
[5:54:30] brewgamingtv: I don't think we'll see a race as long as this tier
[5:54:39] brewgamingtv: I wouldn't want to see that again
[5:54:58] Zeke_nl: time being the biggest
[5:55:12] Zeke_nl: scott for example
[5:55:28] Nokterian: So many had to take time off from work since they never stream and just play the game
[5:55:29] Rottencoarse: @Zeke_nl  which scott?
[5:55:32] manmower: getting players of that skill level is the easiest part probably
[5:55:32] brewgamingtv: Sloot to liquid
[5:55:35] brewgamingtv: I'd love to see that
[5:55:39] Zeke_nl: liquid scott
[5:55:52] Zeke_nl: he had to fly back because of work
[5:55:59] Exxcar: That would mean Liquid lose a tank, which I don't see happening
[5:56:06] duffluv22: Categorize RWF by regions....Will that work? Guess not because guilds would cheat watching other guilds strats??
[5:56:11] Deadcells: You beat mythic Andy yet?
[5:56:26] Aro725: I feel like sloot just doesnt like wow as much anymore. I think SL broke him
[5:56:35] Blvdman: Limit wouldnt take him probably, they already have top tier tanks
[5:56:43] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  limit should have taken Sloot for real
[5:56:51] Rottencoarse: but i'm happy ythat he's in BDGG
[5:56:57] sstriife: yeah I'm surprised sloot isn't in liquid or echo
[5:57:23] Rottencoarse: @sstriife  sloot returned to NA raiding and streaming times so i think he passed on echo
[5:57:24] brewgamingtv: Echo has two top tier tanks in EU
[5:57:47] reggiepowa: I'm sure Meeres would prefer to dps
[5:58:04] gregl__: comparing sloot to meeres/naowh LUL
[5:58:23] brewgamingtv: I could see sloot going to liquid 10.0
[5:58:44] Rottencoarse: @brewgamingtv  it depends on his contract
[5:58:50] Nokterian: What i did learn during my time with FFXIV it isn't a game to stream like at all..the story sure at the highlights of each expansion or patch but not like how WoW does with m+/pvp/raiding.
[5:59:04] MasterNeff: GLORIA
