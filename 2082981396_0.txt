[0:38:25] TakLunae: i feel like that's just the way it is with wow though, it seems like you always have to justify why you like it to people zeplaQthink
[0:38:39] dimi9231: dw
[0:38:41] Cloudstrife259: Zelden Ring
[0:38:55] KorenaiAcorn: @zeplahq I stopped playing WoW before Shadowlands released. I can't enjoy it anymore. But I'm happy for those who are enjoying it.
[0:39:12] dimi9231: the spectacle
[0:39:17] dimi9231: i think he means the raids
[0:39:29] Ren26: we get the trials at least
[0:39:34] perow: we get dungeons
[0:39:40] Cloudstrife259: outside of a raid he's saying give us like an extreme story boss fight
[0:39:46] Cloudstrife259: like endsinger
[0:39:51] Ren26: i think it was yea
[0:39:51] dimi9231: dont htink so
[0:40:05] dimi9231: great song btw
[0:40:13] XtelLenova: zeplaPopcorn
[0:40:45] churros724: straight up just edging you story lol
[0:40:49] dimi9231: to be meaningful
[0:40:52] perow: WoW needs MSQ thats for sure. a good story without reading the books
[0:40:55] Ren26: i suspect he doesnt like the story being finished in the raid
[0:41:00] omenoflight: lets just be real WoW will never have the story and plot layout to take you through the game like 15
[0:41:02] Cloudstrife259: wow is just a series of cliffhangers with no interesting stuff honestly
[0:41:03] riels__: WoW needs meaningful leveling
[0:41:05] omenoflight: 14'
[0:41:06] ãƒ—ãƒªã‚¢: and a story conclusion with that boss battle
[0:41:09] dimi9231: a battle to remember
[0:41:18] Cloudstrife259: its hard to look back even when i was a wow fan and not say that the story was always incredibly shallow
[0:41:35] dimi9231: my son
[0:41:56] Ren26: wrath is great becuase literally every zone, patch, and quest is all leading to taht final fight
[0:41:59] Thoroto: i agree that wow would be awesome with a msq and etc but...diff playerbase a msq in wow would not work imo
[0:41:59] dimi9231: lich king trial imagine
[0:42:01] KorenaiAcorn: WotLK was my favourite expansion.
[0:42:09] Dranni21312: wrath of the lich king GIGACHAD
[0:42:12] Thoroto: most of players dont even look the story
[0:42:14] omenoflight: 14 is the way it is  with the store because at its core its a FF JRPG with an MMO aspect. its why the story is so good and it plays out
[0:42:19] dimi9231: totally diffferent games
[0:42:22] omenoflight: It will never will
[0:42:29] nurupo: ulduar after arthas would be okay I think, yogg saron works independently
[0:42:33] LisaraAuenland: WoW means really bad storywriting in the last few expansions xDD
[0:42:40] churros724: they've just given up in wwanting WoW they just want FFXIV wwith WoW skin lol
[0:42:48] KorenaiAcorn: @dranni21312 yes zeplaDancingMaracas zeplaDancingbluebun
[0:43:07] omenoflight: @churros724 lol facts
[0:43:07] dimi9231: same
[0:43:19] dimi9231: not into alts tbh
[0:43:21] shamethehomegame: Wrath's a bad example because WoW hasn't done that since (maybe in DF with Iridikron?) but chasing Arthas through the questing, then the dungeons, then the ICC heroics and FINALLY ICC was really special
[0:43:38] dimi9231: its tedious
[0:43:45] LordConga: zeplaQthink
[0:43:45] perow: @shamethehomegame YUP
[0:43:49] SouthBoyB: yep
[0:43:49] Lovejism: boring tundra
[0:43:49] mccallow: ah yes. boring tundra
[0:43:58] dimi9231: yes
[0:44:06] dimi9231: we all had free time as kids
[0:44:08] Dranni21312: howling fjord tho was good compared to borean tundra NODDERS
[0:44:12] KorenaiAcorn: zeplaQlul zeplaQlul
[0:44:18] XtelLenova: Never played wow pass the free trial. I always feel like it's too late zeplaPopcorn
[0:44:30] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQthink zeplaQthink
[0:44:31] Dranni21312: @XtelLenova it's never too late tbh zeplaQshrug
[0:44:37] Kulisiak: imagine - adults have less time to play than kids/students. who would have thought XD
[0:44:46] dimi9231: gotta go fast
[0:45:07] Narros: Why dud everybody leveling into tundra and not howling fjord it's way better
[0:45:14] perow: shadowlands and dragonflight had really bad payoffs
[0:45:23] dimi9231: this looks like diablo char screen
[0:45:27] omenoflight: link the video! plzz
[0:45:46] XtelLenova: The nostalgia/ social aspect is too late @Dranni21312  I wouldn't understand as a new player
[0:45:49] dimi9231: yes
[0:45:59] riels__: it is super annoying. blizz definitely needed to do this warbands thing.
[0:46:01] dimi9231: the job system is one of the best things in ffxiv
[0:46:32] dimi9231: especially for people who dont like alts
[0:46:44] TakLunae: I recently started the game @XtelLenova and i truly felt it was more new player friendly than xiv in some ways and i was able to streamline what i wanted from wow more than xiv which forces you in certain directions zeplaComfy
[0:46:45] Fossabot: You ever see other chatters write weird words and wonder what the heck is going on? Well don't worry, they're emotes from a (trusted) browser plugin, which you can find here 7TV: https://7tv.app
[0:46:53] riels__: the amount of times i'd make an alt because i think it would be fun, and then i get to level cap and i have nothing unlocked for end game AAAA
[0:46:54] dimi9231: lets have a relaxing time
[0:47:05] chase4a1: Sounds like some WoW players just couldn't find the unistall button and forced themselves to keep playing lol

[1:30:39] nightst314: Incorporeal (random spawn has to be CCed) and Spiteful (Add spawns when a mob dies) makes pulls super long and boss fights stressful all of a sudden.
[1:31:12] KofiStreamBot: Visit ZeplaHQ's Ko-fi page at: https://ko-fi.com/zeplahq?ref=twitch

[1:31:39] Dranni21312: Yes to both
[1:31:46] Alastor7783: explosive and some other one
[1:32:06] nightst314: Incorporeal is new, Necrotic got retired (healing debuff stacking on tanks). Explosive is also gone, made big pulls a nightmare.
[1:32:06] Dranni21312: explosive and necrotic are retired for instance right now
[1:32:10] dimi9231: whats your fav affix
[1:32:34] Alastor7783: as a warrior, afflicted
[1:32:38] Alastor7783: I don't have to do anything LULW
[1:32:47] golgin_: Sadge Zepla hates shadow priests
[1:32:49] dimi9231: is the priest dps
[1:32:52] nightst314: and afflicted is also new but doable when you're not forced to heal 24/7

[1:36:55] TakLunae: KEKL
[1:36:59] nightst314: this season is less punishing below +20 for average players. currently the best one (number wise) since Legion
[1:37:00] Dranni21312: @CobaltblueTV it is NODDERS
[1:37:01] crumbler81: I'm terrified of jumping into M+ by myself LUL
[1:37:11] dimi9231: a regular
[1:37:18] Dranni21312: and yeah this season was the least punishing in a while NODDERS
[1:37:20] golgin_: You would be surprised how much the mass consciousness likes to repeat the same memetic ideas
[1:37:27] CobaltblueTV: @Dranni21312 Dang, i need to get back into m+ healing then
[1:37:38] nightst314: too few interupts

[1:38:18] Alastor7783: if you don't kill them
[1:38:22] F_Word_In_Distress: @golgin_ canâ€™t remember when that was ever funny but yeah
[1:38:23] dimi9231: someone who likes the player to suffer
[1:38:23] golgin_: Kreygasm should have called it horny mode and they bust from enough damage
[1:38:25] Alastor7783: they had 1-shottable hp
[1:38:32] Alastor7783: but if you pull a big pack you can't see their HP
[1:38:43] Dranni21312: mobs in combat had a chance of spawning an explosive orb that could not be tab targeted or AOE'd down, and each orb has a cast on a timer which would explode and deal massive group damage
[1:38:56] Dranni21312: the more mobs you had engaged, the more orbs could spawn
[1:39:00] dimi9231: KEKL
[1:39:01] nightst314: active players and success rate have never been this high since 2017
[1:39:04] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQthink zeplaQthink
[1:39:07] golgin_: @F_Word_In_Distress as it usually is, a joke gets a reaction from someone at some point and it gets repeated over and over again

[1:46:57] Alastor7783: I know they're not talking about Chryterion from Annie's community
[1:46:58] nightst314: sounds like Criterion is +25 or so
[1:47:03] dimi9231: i agree
[1:47:07] dimi9231: bunbelievable
[1:47:19] Alastor7783: FFXIV people, explain what they're talking about KEKW
[1:47:43] nightst314: or sounds like old Challange Modes with super rough timers
[1:48:01] dimi9231: criterion savage is even more different
[1:48:07] Nigerianbucket: XIV is incredibly scared of adding in another pillar of progression beyond the raid
[1:48:09] crumbler81: is M+ new player friendly nowadays?

[1:48:33] Alastor7783: do a +20 LETSGO
[1:48:39] InfiniFiasco: they gate keep M+ based on some score thing
[1:48:52] golgin_: Go hard or go home
[1:48:59] sueheidi: on eu or us?

[1:49:10] nightst314: @InfiniFiasco below +10 nobody asks for anything by now
[1:49:12] Alastor7783: Pog
[1:49:13] Isrette: oh 18 even better :D
[1:49:22] Lento_VI: That's the spirit zeplaQraid
[1:49:50] InfiniFiasco: yeah probably now that nothing matters but once a new season happens things will go back to gate keeping
[1:50:02] golgin_: Pog stream sniping (good)
[1:50:04] Alastor7783: was that not obvious? LULW
[1:50:11] crumbler81: so could you get your own key and slowly progress your score pretty easily?
[1:50:12] Alastor7783: also, is this the same person that was a blood dk last time ?
[1:50:20] dimi9231: @Alastor7783 it was :D
[1:50:28] nightst314: @InfiniFiasco well the treshold is a bit lower but you can still do the early keylvls with any group

[2:02:29] dimi9231: feet strat
[2:02:58] LordConga: zeplaBUNSPIN zeplaBUNSPIN

[2:03:38] InfiniFiasco: yeah cause they did bad stuff
[2:03:47] Runali97: weeeeee
[2:03:49] blazhevski: wasnt there like 2 fan festivals last year?
[2:03:51] nightst314: 2020. 2021, 2022. Gamescom hasn't been a thing for 6 years by now
[2:03:54] Alastor7783: retirement home? Kappa
[2:03:55] blazhevski: and one at the start of this year
[2:03:55] TakLunae: AYAYAHYPER
[2:04:02] dimi9231: hard work
[2:04:09] TakLunae: zeplaCozyLove
[2:04:45] dimi9231: :D
[2:05:33] LordConga: zeplaQnotes zeplaQnotes
[2:05:35] nightst314: only at low HP raging happens. The big green lumbering monstrosities are dangerous once they enrage. Same goes for casters before the 3rd boss.
[2:05:38] dimi9231: multitask
[2:05:53] dimi9231: it was exciting
[2:06:06] dimi9231: around july or its not confirmed?
[2:06:17] crumbler81: start of summer? Kappa
[2:06:24] dimi9231: its like they know
[2:06:30] nightst314: TWW looks like late August
[2:07:04] Jarlan23: what things in dawntrail have u excited? i havent been keeping up with the news
[2:07:06] dimi9231: nice birthday present
[2:07:11] nightst314: turning 43
[2:07:21] LordConga: zeplaQyay zeplaQyay
[2:07:22] Shrandamar: 43 damn
[2:07:28] dimi9231: would be a great present
[2:07:38] xCD80: Leo
[2:07:48] dimi9231: you are doing great
[2:08:10] dimi9231: you are gigachad too
[2:08:21] Deenol626: No one's died *yet* LUL
[2:08:56] Alastor7783: actually we have 2 deaths
[2:09:06] Alastor7783: 1 was zepla anniesGiggle
[2:09:13] dimi9231: field operations
[2:09:26] Deenol626: Nah those don't count lol
[2:09:55] dimi9231: focus
[2:10:16] Lento_VI: zeplaBunnylaugh
[2:10:18] dimi9231: goo everywhere
[2:10:32] onemarvzalot: Ace HypeBLEH
[2:10:41] beeeves_: you can't move UI in combat :/
[2:10:53] dimi9231: ui stream
[2:11:29] Shirviu: i suggest putting the party frame right in the front of your screen under your chars feet so you arent tunnel visioning on the top corner
[2:11:31] dimi9231: and you did great
[2:11:36] cirriusgg: XIV has been trying so hard to future proof their content but ended up making stuff that was underwhelming in EW
[2:11:50] Deenol626: Do you think with Blizz announcing a 3 series expansion, if they hard pivot and focus on more of a single player like story similar to how FF14 does, could that actually work for wow? OR do you think Blizz should go back to a playstyle how classic is with far more group focused content and harder world stuff?
[2:11:57] LordConga: zeplaQnotes zeplaQnotes
[2:12:29] dimi9231: i remember this boss being very hard
[2:12:29] Dranni21312: ded
[2:13:10] dimi9231: panicge
[2:13:11] Lento_VI: zeplaThisisFine
[2:13:11] Dranni21312: Saved
[2:14:12] dimi9231: wow is always more multiplayer focused
[2:14:21] onemarvzalot: No mow
[2:14:21] LordConga: Yeah
[2:14:31] dimi9231: yes
[2:14:43] dimi9231: big dmg
[2:14:47] LordConga: They should focus on letting people have fun instead of only raiding
[2:15:14] Deenol626: I personally agree with that. I would much much rather they go back to a similar playstyle to classic. Slow stuff down and make elite quests actually require a group
[2:15:26] beeeves_: for this boss, the order of casts is: damage, damage, run away
[2:15:31] Dranni21312: PeepoRunCry
[2:15:38] dimi9231: this boss hits hard
[2:15:50] Deenol626: @LordConga I agree, but what is "fun" to a million people? Everybody has a different opinion
[2:16:11] dimi9231: map boss
[2:16:16] Alastor7783: "we got damage in 5 seconds" but I have 7 second delay on stream Sadge
[2:16:23] smgBanzai: mage boss is life changingly easier when someone's at max range
[2:16:36] dimi9231: a prelude
[2:16:48] Dranni21312: @smgBanzai true!
[2:16:53] smgBanzai: it always throws out a combo of two of the three elements, and when it's arcane that orb that pulls people is baited to furthest person
[2:17:09] dimi9231: like souls game
[2:17:16] Dranni21312: @smgBanzai also welcome to the stream zeplaLoveHeart
[2:17:25] dimi9231: the dwarf
[2:17:42] LordConga: Yes
[2:17:45] zeffjiggler69: damn guess we forgot what blizzard did to their employees.
[2:17:51] Deenol626: Exactly like how the souls games do! You figure out the world through small bits
[2:17:52] dimi9231: the dwarf and the tree in dragonflight
[2:17:58] Jarlan23: i think the best stories WoW told was in cataclysm with each zone having its own story
[2:18:26] Dranni21312: yes, wow storytelling is definitely "special" KEKW
[2:18:29] Fossabot: You ever see other chatters write weird words and wonder what the heck is going on? Well don't worry, they're emotes from a (trusted) browser plugin, which you can find here 7TV: https://7tv.app
[2:18:49] dimi9231: its reviving the little ones
[2:19:11] Dranni21312: +2 GIGACHAD
[2:19:11] dknamey: I've done this dungeon like 50 times and I just noticed recently this final boss location is outside stormwind
[2:19:42] dimi9231: new upgrade
[2:19:51] LordConga: zeplaPepeD zeplaPepeD
[2:19:52] aresglacier: can i join you? elemental shaman
[2:20:14] dimi9231: LUL
[2:20:15] Alastor7783: monkaW
[2:20:17] AwakenRevelation: One of the quests I remember in WoW was the outhouse side quest in Grizzly Hills, that quest grossed me out a little but it made me laugh.
[2:20:29] CobaltblueTV: @Jarlan23 the problem with that is, i feel, that the game felt like a theme park ride with another theme in every zone. it stopped feeling like a real world with conflicts spanning over different zones
[2:20:45] TriashTristar: @ZeplaHQ watching you play last epoch was phun. when more?
[2:21:03] guimello2: when edge ring MadgeLate

[2:24:05] dimi9231: which is good
[2:24:05] Enderking859: Are you going to do NG+ on Elden Ring?

[2:34:40] Ze_Goo: move your party frames lower right above your bars, get weakauras setup to go between your player / target frame (can hide bars and use weakaura instead of having both)
