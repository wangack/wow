[0:45:07] MedicineMan: LUL
[0:45:10] Dephunk: its dumb af tbh
[0:45:10] Xiodrade: when you're not in the club you're considered a civilian as well.. and you have to follow passing laws on the road
[0:45:12] Shurn_82: yep, tehres a lot of rules, I have friends that are part of The Loners our here by me

[0:45:59] 91Niki: My parents was in biker clubs since they were young. I grew up with that. Normal biking clubs don't have that kinda rules. At least here in eu @Towelliee LUL
[0:46:00] KronasKG: Seems like more trouble then it is worth

[0:46:19] Darkaon: Lol 98% of bikers on harleys are fat fucks anyways.
[0:46:27] Snabido: Cosmetic change
[0:46:27] Xiodrade: if you're on a bike and you aren't in the club you can't pass without approval a dude at the rear
[0:46:31] 91Niki: @the_toe_knife Yeah but Hells Angels are very different from normal biker clubs tho LUL
[0:46:48] Darkaon: And not a single H.A. i know would give a shit. Most of them keep a low profile
[0:46:49] headshot_hunter6: i like the idea of rare gear thats reasonably powerfull.

[0:48:19] PokerFaceMoose: when I was taking the train from Denmark to Sweden we had our passports checked because hells angels had exploded a car bomb
[0:48:22] ca8l: American motorcycle clubs come from a time when many roads had no visible markings to guarantee other drivers equal amount of road so these motorcycle clubs would commonly run people off the road literally
[0:48:24] neverbornlucky: survived my rituxan treatment yesterday at IV in fusion. Was up there from  7am to 3pm with the IV in my arm on itp/evans disease related
[0:48:31] 91Niki: @Featherbow Sure EU biker clubs also have their weird clubs, Hells Angels and more. But most regular biker clubs are some of the most friendly and chill people you will find one earth

[0:49:28] Darkaon: @91Niki Same goes for hells angels. Most of them are more worried about making money then some dude wearing some leather.

[0:52:22] mrheimz: LUL that is so true though
[0:53:06] mrheimz: interesting choice
[0:53:12] 91Niki: @Darkaon Well difference is, most local regular biker clubs here are more like a chill book club. Nobody is gonna yell at you if you don't wear your vest, or hang out with other biker clubs. Unlike Hells Angels which is a lot more closer to a cult than a chill club. Not to mention the whole illegal shenanigans, but that's a whole other convo

[4:29:10] Idowork757: selfishly as a M+ only player, 6 weeks is a long time with no tier
[4:29:11] smashwow: which is the same exact time of 6 weeks
[4:29:11] MrGharr: wasnt it 8 weeks?
[4:29:29] smashwow: @MrGharr 6 weeks after mythic raid open
[4:29:30] Rictamar: The problem is they still see it as a catch up mechanic, when in reality it is how ALOT of people got their tier
[4:29:35] smashwow: 8 after patch
[4:29:41] Theduskflyer: Theduskflyer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 94 months! 94 bebe
[4:30:37] dneario: it would be interesting if they would implement less vertical scaling
[4:30:43] MrGharr: 6 weeks could be OK if they announce additional stuff
[4:30:49] dneario: and make it more difficult and depend on horizontal scaling more
[4:30:49] Gingerprimer: 6 weeks is good IMO depending on how they do the charges/currency system
[4:30:54] smashwow: more than 4 is too long. especially if your tier set is good
[4:31:04] jarilrpg: if it comes at 6 weeks, it needs to not have the charge system
[4:31:22] Phatori: To me even as a M+ player I dont see an issue with Raiding having an edge on getting tier faster. Now i think CC should come out 4 weeks in and should have 2 charges to start with
[4:31:31] MrGharr: 6 is only OK if they give some way for M+ and pvp
[4:31:37] Mecabeast: did they say that purple drops would only be last boss of dungeon for m0s?

[4:32:00] Phatori: Rated PvP and M+ are not ont eh same level to blizz in terms of what they feel is endgame content so they want to push ppl there with tier sets beign faster to acquire
[4:32:03] Jherny: pvp
[4:32:13] zeeAbe: Could give scaling PvP tier pieces from vendor
[4:32:23] MrGharr: by with conquest/valor?
[4:32:28] BuffiDoinks: Make the best pvp gear 1 step down from the best pve gear, but equal when doing pvp
[4:32:30] smashwow: call me crazy. but you could put tier on the vendors
[4:32:30] TacDuc: You don't please PvP'ers
[4:32:35] SirSquaggles: Why not make an item you can buy from the pvp vendor that upgrades pvp gear into tier pieces for honor? Would be a good way to spend extra honor so you're not always honor capped
[4:33:00] Rictamar: imagine if they just added a vendor and you could buy tier with badges or some shit. Have a weekly cap, problem solved
[4:33:02] Roenoake: I did more M+ then raiding it was alot more interesting to me compared to Sepulcher
[4:33:03] Gingerprimer: It is also fine that if you do more types of content you have a higher chance of getting gear IMO
[4:33:39] NBK_Sethus: people will always go for lower effort and higher reward, if they introduce 3-man dungeons then everyone would go for that
[4:33:42] Rictamar: it would be for everyone, this vendor I am talking about, and the currency to buy the gear comes from every activity
[4:33:43] smashwow: you could put it on a valor vendor too
[4:33:46] SirSquaggles: ah that makes sense
[4:33:47] smashwow: it works both ways
[4:33:49] Rictamar: people who still want to raid and pvp will do
[4:34:03] Donavato: will they ever bring group finder or is it a "no go" for ever?
[4:34:10] MrGharr: vendor with Random items including tier?
[4:34:20] Rictamar: FF does it and it works very well, and that game isn't about gear at all
[4:34:24] Donavato: i pray they do >.>
[4:35:05] Rictamar: no yeh, their gearing is entirely deterministic
[4:35:08] SirSquaggles: They said they're adding M+ soon peepoHappy
[4:35:11] Rictamar: its how it has always been
[4:35:38] MrGharr: Horrific vision gearing could be applied (regarding the limited ilvl loot) to M+ and pvp
[4:35:50] Dcarter: yeah but trash in 14 isnt bad
[4:36:16] Rictamar: I just think a vendor where you could buy gear if you are incredibly unlucky with currency you get from all activities makes sense. Hopefully the dinar system will be this
[4:36:19] SirSquaggles: i would assume so
[4:36:22] Dcarter: id assume but not sure what theyll do
[4:36:26] Dcarter: itll be fun to see what happens
[4:36:29] Gingerprimer: Core of WOW is also the grind for gear aswell
[4:36:42] smashwow: @Gylduran sadly the dinar system isn't coming to DF
[4:37:12] Rictamar: @smashwow yeh that is annoying af, they hate deterministic gearing which blows my mind, because it is universally loved :(
[4:37:20] organicmolecules: like 32g
[4:37:27] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Not on Mankrik. It's 50g now lol
[4:37:27] Mecabeast: ad tier for d+ launches today for new users and current users nov 3
[4:37:36] smashwow: @Gingerprimer grinding is fine. as long as at the end of the grind i don't have a slot machine that hoses me.
[4:38:07] smashwow: that's the thing that needs solved
[4:38:37] enux337: yep with bfa lol
[4:38:46] smashwow: the endless slot machines of slot machines of slot machines is tiresome
[4:38:58] Rictamar: yeh i could totally see them adding a gear vendor in the first patch, going back to WoW's "roots" is the theme :D
[4:39:44] smashwow: don't give me a vendor like corruption.
[4:39:52] zeeAbe: Storms won't be live when you hit the cap, they release with the raids, right?
[4:40:11] MoodyVanessa: @zeeAbe yes they release with the raid
[4:40:16] zeeAbe: They said that storms go live with the season
[4:40:19] MoodyVanessa: they already confirmed it
[4:40:23] enux337: i can see it now best storm farming spec meta

[4:40:35] MoodyVanessa: sesaon
[4:40:37] MoodyVanessa: season*
[4:40:45] Rictamar: storms are meant to be an alt catchup I thought, and go live when the raid comes out
[4:40:52] enux337: thats my vision of it lol
[4:41:03] MoodyVanessa: the storm
[4:41:05] enux337: boomies everywhere
[4:41:23] MrGharr: who are the Hearoes of the Storm?
[4:41:29] Kittastrophe: wait wait wait youre saying its boomie season for df? do i need to come out of retirement?
[4:41:34] smashwow: if storms are meant for alt catch up... ooof
[4:41:38] luckfore: thought it was supposed to be for catchup gear for later on
[4:41:50] vic_ave: i swore in Preach video they said storms were for catch up gear later on
[4:42:00] vic_ave: because its higher gear then dungeons
[4:42:01] andrejhmm: People are dumb. Drops have to be RNG in Multiplayer RPGs. Otherwise, the game would not last for long. If you want Fixed drops to go play Single player RPGs
[4:42:14] luckfore: wheres the info blizz lol
[4:42:31] smashwow: prof leveling is dependent on DF knowledge. and i've seen 0 literature about how you get it outside of first time crafting.
[4:42:43] MrGharr: waiting for M+ info

[4:42:51] smashwow: that's what scares me about profs
[4:43:00] Rictamar: @andrejhmm FFXIV would like to have a word, they have an entirely deterministic gearing, and the game is far from dead lol
[4:43:29] smashwow: idk a blue post about it would be nice XD
[4:43:36] andrejhmm: @Gylduran Deterministic and fixed is not the same thing.
[4:43:44] smashwow: here's the crafting system and how it works
[4:44:31] Rictamar: @andrejhmm but you are saying without RNG drops, an MMO won't last, and that is asinine my dude

[4:47:18] Lazugo: you guys saw that chat
[4:47:57] the_bad_goat: Can't tell you how many times I wiped a raid being summoned from a PVP match with my pet on aggro
[4:48:22] the_bad_goat: that was back in BC
[4:48:26] 3dRes: You going to TwitchCon Towelliee?
[4:48:33] Featherbow: @3dRes no
[4:48:35] wowking35: how is lw looking
[4:48:57] andrejhmm: @Gylduran Fixed loot is literally like Baldur's gate type of game. It is always the same regardless of class. I don't mean one hundred percent RNG but RNG depends on your Class and difficulty within a Fixed Pool of Loot. Like you will always get a piece of loot its just Rng which one you will get. Now chances of some loot being 0.001 might be too much. Anyways iy is no asinine even some single-player games do this like GTA. You obviously have nop played enough games.
[4:49:28] MrSupernoodles: WutFace
[4:49:52] Kittastrophe: last time i went to twitchcon i got sick for a month
[4:50:04] Rictamar: @andrejhmm cool story bro lol
[4:50:12] Kinghorn: twitchcon is zoomertown
[4:50:12] MoodyVanessa: i found where they said about the elemental storms starting with season 1 it was on one of the beta development notes
[4:50:13] andrejhmm: True
[4:50:18] NBK_Sethus: sounds like a normal person's nightmare
[4:50:19] ThaOriginalGamester: zoom zoom
[4:50:25] garmin1987: there will be alot of blow up pools
[4:50:34] zeeAbe: @Towelliee the info about Elemental Storms coming with Season 1 is in the Beta Patchnotes. Quote here: "Developers’ note: The Elemental Storms that the Primalists are inflicting upon the Dragon Isles are a new feature that will be available when Dragonflight Season 1 starts and won’t be active when Dragonflight launches. This week we’ve disabled them to ensure we’re gathering accurate player feedback on the outdoor world during the initial weeks after Dragonflight’s launch."
[4:50:37] Dcarter: Same keeping my ass at home
[4:51:09] andrejhmm: @Gylduran Don't respond next time if you are not going to take the discussion seriously.
[4:51:20] Rictamar: The storms sounds like a catch up or alternate gearing system for people who don't take part in traditional end game stuff
[4:51:30] Lazugo: Overwatch 2 is on
[4:52:16] Rictamar: @andrejhmm nah your point is absurd, and you have no idea what you are arguing about. I'm not engaging with you anymore. Have a nice day
[4:52:54] andrejhmm: @Gylduran you too

[4:56:24] LoseAlotLuke: I wonder what the queue is for overwatch
[4:56:26] TheUnknowing: I mean they are taking the final fantasy approach where you dont have to play the game 24/7 how that will play out with WoW players, who knows.
[4:56:27] Rictamar: I hard disagree, the only people who believe that don't play other games
[4:56:28] GamingDad77: But are those circles right handed? Or left?
[4:56:51] Rictamar: I like that I'm going to be able to play WoW for however long I want, and leave without feeling like I'm missing out
[4:56:55] enux337: bliz is gonna be like but this is what you wanted
[4:57:19] Dcarter: Yeah imma play other stuff which is cool

[5:43:51] anchovie82: i remember how we did it cause his cast speed is based off his hp so we saved cds and blew him up before he casted again
