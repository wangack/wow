[0:41:39] robert_332: morning Towelliee

[2:19:38] whiskytrix: it's getting built into talents. you don't need to go farm lego's in gear slots
[2:19:42] ArcaneSyntax: I'm excited to get some artifact weapon stuff back maybe

[2:19:45] Deadcells: In the talent tree you mean?

[2:20:59] lithium364: RIP ashen hallow
[2:21:20] manmower: ill take the 80% haste borrowed power from corruption
[2:21:21] Donswag3: im super interested in seeing how many covenant abilities they'll keep around
[2:21:33] ArcaneSyntax: throw ashen in the dumpster.
[2:21:33] Deadcells: Yea in my opinion the system right now is tough to deal with. On my Lock if I want to do the most damage I should be changing covenants depending on fight to do the most damage
[2:21:48] Deadcells: Least with talent trees we can change loadouts
[2:21:55] TheCliffyShow: I hope they put Flagellation in the rogue tree.

[2:22:50] ArcaneSyntax: shaman are gonna keep vesper I think.
[2:22:59] skymercii: @thecliffyshow nah gimme the NF one
[2:23:05] manmower: like convoke was too good, probably can't keep that one
[2:23:08] Pritamin: ardenweald ww monk ability is sweet tho weak
[2:23:09] shimwood: I wish they would keep Soulshape for Druids instead of Convoke darkoHands
[2:23:12] TacDuc: *Looks at convike*
[2:23:23] Alabastermatt: i think DKs will 100% keep the arm ability
[2:23:24] theJUDGEtr: @manmower it;s in the new druid talent tree in dragonflight
[2:23:49] manmower: must be a neutered down version of convoke
[2:24:01] theJUDGEtr: I sure hope so haha
[2:24:06] Donswag3: has to be abom yeah
[2:24:06] ArcaneSyntax: prepatch is gonna be fun if covenant abilities are in the tree, people running around with multiple covenant abilities on their bars.
[2:24:09] Sledgecore: Jazz hands
[2:24:19] skymercii: isn't invoke already neutered?  @manmower
[2:24:37] skymercii: convoke*

[2:25:00] shimwood: Everything about Boomkin is neutered, we're not allowed to have fun

[2:25:22] TheItalianStallion321: OH YEAH BIG NUMBERS
[2:25:25] bigoldmeatpie: didn't holinka say that it'll be possible to have more than 1 cov ability in the new trees but you'd have to give something up for that?
[2:25:28] Donswag3: MrGM said ilvl 300 is dropping from season 4 content
[2:25:31] Eggz1004: asmon asked Ion in his interview a few days ago

[2:27:48] faulen: peepoLeave

[2:27:51] NotEnoughMana: i hate meaningful choices
[2:27:51] lithium364: i mena holinka said its possible for druids to get adaptive swarm+convoke but you have to sacrifice something major for it
[2:27:52] Sylphy_TV: zekeTHINK
[2:27:54] zarod89: I want meaningless choice
[2:28:00] WoW_StandalonE: and 2 weeks to repect
[2:28:03] whiskytrix: they talked about focusing more on the trees being about passives that modify abilities than new abilities. my guess is they put covenants on one tier, lego's on another, and maybe 1 new ability role, and the rest will be passives
[2:28:05] WoW_StandalonE: respec
[2:28:16] hyvlaar: I just hope they will do something about WW monk LUL

[2:29:06] ashwing_: people pretending that old talent trees actually gave a choice LUL
[2:29:10] Henke1983: i often go for passive talent, don't need more buttons to push
[2:29:12] JQ47: do you think warrior will keep any of there SL abilities?
[2:29:18] nightmayor12: WHy would you wanna get rid of such a great tool
[2:29:31] KumaEnjoyer: there is always gonna be a best spec for damage output, I hope talents will be more focused on utility, to actually change playstyle slightly
[2:29:36] skymercii: I watched the asmon interview with ion and he said wanted to keep Covenants into DragonFlight but no mission table planned
[2:29:38] DeanoTV: Warrior will probs keep necro banner/kyrian spear
[2:29:53] whiskytrix: i think they've learned (hopefully). i don't think they will put competing single target abilities or passives on a row. i think they will be built for single target, aoe, and maybe two target cleave. then you can build different loadouts based ont he previews.
[2:30:17] TheCliffyShow: I just bought the murloc baby transmogs.  I love buying store stuff with WoW Tokens.
[2:30:21] trevt6: its not borrowed tho, its permanat
[2:30:22] faulen: The thought is it wont change from xpac to xpac
[2:30:27] Razaku_: I think its about removing the borrowed part. like i n 11.0 we keep the talent tree
[2:30:30] manmower: borrowed power means you lose at end of xpac or tier
[2:30:32] skymercii: borrowed power started in Vanilla #changemymind
[2:30:37] Sledgecore: just less bullshit systems to grind
[2:30:46] QuigsTV: @hello towelliee how’s your day today
[2:30:55] balancedlight: permanently borrowed
[2:30:57] maalow: this whole 'borrowed power' thing is bullshit anyways
[2:30:59] Razaku_: Yeah but its not borrowed anymore, thats the thing hahaha
[2:31:01] Clicklesly: Borrowed power is just a meme term, you can look at every single gear piece as brorrowed power
[2:31:05] whiskytrix: bruh, just give me wild spirtis and stop making BM aoe trash tier
[2:31:08] manmower: flasks are borrowed power
[2:31:19] TheCliffyShow: Gear is borrowed power.
[2:31:20] TacDuc: @balancedlight So stolen
[2:31:30] manmower: PI is not borrowed power, they never share
[2:31:32] Pachez: why doing korthia btw?
[2:31:40] Frank4LuLz: Bring Back World Buffs on timers!!!!!
[2:31:41] Yenroz: @manmower No they are stored power Kappa
[2:31:42] TheCliffyShow: Instead, we should call it System Power.
[2:32:01] Snabido: So the goal of this char now is to reach exalted with the Enlightened? 😏
[2:32:01] lithium364: imagine the salt if evokers get bloodlust+pi+something new LUL
[2:32:19] tetrahydridodinitrogen: my phone runs on borrowed power
[2:32:34] skymercii: Would you want Corruption back ?
[2:32:36] Sereannon: but we aren't giving it back at the end of the expac
[2:32:40] WoW_StandalonE: AP is still AP, no matter how you called it
[2:32:46] jaalexba: @Towelliee Is this the part where the 9-5 guy quits his job and plays more?
[2:32:46] maalow: gear is borrowed power, we replace it at some point
[2:32:53] manmower: temporary systems would be a better term
[2:32:53] net_mi: Everything is borrowed, everything is just 0 and 1
[2:32:54] Razaku_: I think when people say 'borrowed' power they mean that it will disappear at some point
[2:33:00] Pachez: we should be using heart of azeroth again in the next expansion honestly.
[2:33:02] Alexkayzz: our sub is borrowed power
[2:33:07] Sledgecore: Blockbuster video power
[2:33:08] Naxs_: Wouldnt any changes in any expansion be borrowed power
[2:33:09] Frank4LuLz: weed whacker
[2:33:09] TheCliffyShow: I borrowed some movies from my brother years ago and still have them.
[2:33:25] Clicklesly: Everything is borrowed cause Blizz technically owns your chars Kappa
[2:33:28] Sereannon: yeah, tier sets is technically borrowed power but it worked better than what  we ended up with
[2:33:34] it_doobie: your sub is borrowed power
[2:33:37] balancedlight: "wake of ashes" Paladins your borrowed power is showing again!! @Towelliee
[2:33:39] Razaku_: When you break everything down into black and white, sure, its all borrowed. Your body is borrowed, your house is borrowed. Your life is borrowed then. Who cares I guess
[2:33:54] Froudini: food is borrowed power that eventually becomes poop slootHmm
[2:34:04] Alepouditsa: it hapen to me i when and ask it back and it turns out it was broken NotLikeThis
[2:34:18] Yenroz: BM hunters is just borrowed power straight throu. Same with shamans and druids. change my mind Kappa
[2:34:19] balancedlight: Your mom is borrowed power...
[2:34:41] Rudric_Ice: this world is BORROWED - Sylvanas
[2:34:57] faulen: like take away aimed shot?
[2:35:01] manmower: hopefully the baseline talents are totally reworked so it feels new
[2:35:03] callmestray: I think they need a new wow game and leave this one behind
[2:35:14] Razaku_: We get to keep it for 11.0, is the difference
[2:35:18] MarquisLek: wow 2
[2:35:42] MarquisLek: the instant they announce wow 2 current wow is dead
[2:35:43] manmower: people don't want to lose all the stuff they farmed
[2:36:05] balancedlight: This just in "Azerite armor makeing a return".
[2:36:05] DeanoTV: WoW 2 will never happen, they already mentioned 13.0
[2:36:11] vic_ave: maybe Phil could buy WoW a new engine with a hemi
[2:36:18] zarod89: a new engine would feel different probably
[2:36:20] twistedtelecast: Dragonflight is WoW 2
[2:36:21] DarqStalker: If I haven’t played the last 2 expansions, will I need to worry about artifact power?

[2:36:33] manmower: look at everquest
[2:36:36] SilkeySmooth: just turn wow 1 in to wow 2 its a win win
[2:36:39] Clicklesly: WoW 2? You mean TBC? That was ages ago Kappa

[2:36:54] Revelations45: I want Alpha now
[2:36:54] silversoidier: id love a graphics update in WoW.
[2:36:57] shalfey4: The whole point that you play is your 18yo char
[2:36:59] Razaku_: The only way they could fix the issues with the engine is making WoW 2, so any talk about cutting down on lag and procs causing issues is moot because blizz will never release wow2
[2:37:01] sporquellushi: hello after sleepin 17 hours
[2:37:05] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  Just buy the wow 2 Portal pass and move 1 charakter over for 49.99
[2:37:09] TacDuc: I had a friend mention he wanted WoW 2 to happen, and the only argument he had was that we all would get a fresh start in the game... So I gave every reason it wouldn't happen
[2:37:21] Sereannon: how did everquest handle it?
[2:37:28] syphergod89: want updated graphics and enginei
[2:37:36] KaisenSiru: OW2 PogChamp
[2:37:38] TheCliffyShow: First thing Microsoft tells Blizzard once the deal is complete, "Make a WoW 2...And, have it stare Master Chief".
[2:37:41] noosphear: @Sereannon EQ2 bombed.  Thats how they handled it.
[2:37:41] Frank4LuLz: No its not
[2:37:41] Razaku_: Biggest issue with how old the game is is that many players want a gold star for playing longer than others and thus they are more entitled
[2:37:42] dldrzoidberg: for sure but they have a better code and they do not have any exucses "the  cooode is 17 years old"
[2:37:46] Arkangel_I: I would like to get wow 2 but I know doesn't make sense to make a wow 2.
[2:37:48] Frank4LuLz: its better
[2:37:54] chaotic_kore_1: chaotickore_93 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! What is your opinion on the new dragonriding mechanic coming in DF? Also what model was your favorite of the 4?
[2:38:03] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  Pve is not new, its just the seasonal events from first game with a new skin on it.. its horrible
[2:38:07] Rudric_Ice: OW 2 but it's OW 1
[2:38:14] mavericks312: Ow 2 is the same damn game +pve
[2:38:23] The_Gofishy: no
[2:38:24] whiskytrix: oh hell no
[2:38:27] Naxs_: Its not really a seprate game tho
[2:38:27] syphergod89: yeah  but money
[2:38:28] reggiepowa: ow2 is an expansion to ow1, not a separate game
[2:38:29] whiskytrix: same freaking game
[2:38:33] EmilBIH: Fortnite chapter 2 vibes
[2:38:34] Frank4LuLz: maybe?
[2:38:38] zarsz95: No but it isn't supposed to be
[2:38:39] bigoldmeatpie: they did test 5v5 on the live game a bit over a year ago
[2:38:39] manmower: OW2 changed ui, like a wow addon
[2:38:42] WoW_StandalonE: its  a marketing thing
[2:38:44] Naxs_: They will just remove ow1 and replace it so its basically a patch
[2:38:45] ArcaneSyntax: the pvp in OW2 isn't a separate game yhough
[2:38:45] Zettabyte: Calling it  OW2 is marketing :)
[2:38:51] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee since this is OW 2 you will still be able to play OW 1 and do 6vs6 bruv night right?
[2:38:52] Getitonthelow: !9TO5 ENDGAME
[2:38:52] QuigsTV: @towelliee I think it’s more for blizzard to make more money off the same title

[2:38:58] rinnegan_madara: !9to5
[2:39:03] whiskytrix: its essentially all the changes that would have happened if they just kept iterating on the original over time rather than build a new game
[2:39:06] balancedlight: All i see is a hunter running around in korthia. I see no guns goin pew pew pew.
[2:39:15] syphergod89: are they at least adding new maps to ow2?
[2:39:17] NotEnoughMana: the graphics do look a bit 'cleaner' and PvE but thats about it LUL
[2:39:18] zarsz95: They said from the start that OW2 PvP is going to be extremely close to OW PvP because they don't want to leave OW players behind
[2:39:19] trevt6: the 3 years to make that is bizzare, its like they didnt do anything. PvE has to be crazy in depth i guess
[2:39:21] rinnegan_madara: !9t05
[2:39:24] Sereannon: year of the spear, baybee
[2:39:26] lithium364: OW2 will be big the forst 2-4 weeks, then blizzard will do the same mistakes the did with ow1 catering to esports alienating normaly players
[2:39:49] lithium364: jeez i need to stop typing in the dark

[2:40:00] TheCliffyShow: The new hero, Sojourn, is fun though.
[2:40:03] zarsz95: OW and OW2 PvP are meant to be tandem projects
[2:40:10] Yenroz: So are people actually mad that they made OW2? I mean i feel like it was kinda wasted but they have been clear from the start what OW2 was gonna be :S
[2:40:19] Tausgi: when you play Overwatch 1 for 1000+ hours overwatch 2 looks and feels kind of different :D

[2:41:55] zarsz95: because it's one with OW1
[2:41:59] balancedlight: they love that number
[2:41:59] Naxs_: ow1 was only $40
[2:42:01] zarsz95: So it doesnt matter what the box price is
[2:42:03] xhaven: if you have OW1 its free but it must be 60 if you dont
[2:42:05] TacDuc: They did 40 for OW1
[2:42:08] mavericks312: bro destiny 2 charged 60 and its the same game

[2:42:28] Kraaze21: CoD model, free/ cost of OW 1 and pay for story mode
[2:42:30] ashwing_: Isnt it free if you have OW 1?
[2:42:31] DarqStalker: Free with gamepass hopefully :)
[2:42:40] zarsz95: If you don't have OW1 then you deserve to buy OW2 for box price lmao so it still doesnt matter
[2:42:47] DeanoTV: KEKW F
[2:42:49] lithium364: lmao
[2:42:55] Naxs_: KEKW

[2:50:47] TacDuc: Me and a friend on some of the first days of SL, "Hmmmm I'm pretty sure that the runecarver is the Primus"
[2:50:53] UlsterFarl: He went from Jailer to Failer in one patch

[3:15:10] Thoreya: its a beautiful thing
[3:15:20] valianya: That invalidates the challenge
[3:15:26] magakigr: even if you transfer i think that the mounts and other stuff that your main has will not transfer.  They are bound to the other account

[3:16:29] SonofHorus82: wait... there are titles?

[3:16:40] Arms_Warrior: do u have to have a title?
[3:16:42] SonofHorus82: like... Mr Stream?
[3:16:46] magakigr: the title is like the sword in silithus
[3:16:58] faulen: BTTV kind of just auto puts you in Theater Mode and there is no title.
[3:17:00] danielthegathering: what is cipher gear even good for
[3:17:03] whiskytrix: what sword
[3:17:09] danielthegathering: its just another zone with clunky boring items that are useless

[4:46:35] TheItalianStallion321: i take a 5000 IU pill, so i dont take it every day or whatever that # is

[6:11:24] mmrghost7: do u even need healer on brew ?
[6:12:22] Bayne77: CD's nutz
[6:12:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: @mmrghost7 Oh yeah the tanks still need a healer for the mega hits that can happen
[6:12:26] Rudric_Ice: is brew hard I only tried BDK tank and I love how BDK plays
[6:13:56] devslewa: @Towelliee can i find addons that you use anywhere

[6:14:11] Maydie6066: @Rudric_Ice Brew isnt "hard" imo, but you can't just face tank everything like other tanks can, your stagger is super nice, but lack of defensive CD's means you have to kit and move a lot
[6:15:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ
[6:15:32] mmrghost7: STAGGER is cheating
[6:15:36] HopeThePriest: I can drop my 21 wake to like a 19 or something see what it turns into.  Holy Priest. Can just run keys if you want. If your doing more. Its Hope btw @Towelliee
[6:16:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having that addon that turns your health bar colors depending on the level of stagger is nice.....it's easier to see when it goes red
[6:17:05] whyyoudolikethat: May i ask where i should start gearing/Tips i didn play for a year...
