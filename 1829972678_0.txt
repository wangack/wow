[2:42:31] DuduVi: buff quest xp, nerf mob xp inside dungeons, ez fix
[2:42:32] Oopogo1: @sodapoppin as a long time HC player who has hit 60, 1x per dungeon also regulates your character's power level out in the world...it's important imo
[2:42:32] darkstarklife: simple lockout mechanic
[2:42:32] Snowlon: reduce xp from dungeon mobs

[7:14:38] pkprell: @sodapoppin Addont wont tell you you are DQ'd till you verify at 60
[7:14:38] Fatal_Flaw: people die and edit the addon to change that @sodapoppin
[7:14:38] Ssly: you're not gonna find out until you try to qualify at level 60
[7:14:41] Jaskaran158: The real gamble is when you hand in your string to get verified at 60
[7:14:42] Psychic1639: dad?

[7:33:49] Harnell: @Toobswoo veibae is vigors
[7:33:50] brelbtw: it ticked 9 hp/5 but stacked 1:1 with healing power. so with 1000 healing power you would heal 1009 hp/5
