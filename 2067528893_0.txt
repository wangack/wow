[1:14:15] lowtherr: fury dream do itt
[1:14:17] reedthesham: Why not
[1:14:19] relapsethegod: I've been Fury main for years and I
[1:14:22] betasoldier: Bad part is he probably thinks you were trolling still and that you purposely tanked his games with you.
[1:14:23] Secretwombatbro: i think arms uses quite a lot of mastery too
[1:14:26] relapsethegod: I have been playign rdruid cus Fury is ass lol
[1:14:28] gjvl: Bajheera says "FURYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
[1:14:29] Secretwombatbro: so you arent really hurting yourself
[1:14:32] aborten: is there even a fury dream?
[1:14:45] ryhigh11: the hunter
[1:14:55] KikLTheSoHot: arms boring, fury - this is the true warrior way
[1:15:06] ryhigh11: becomes a fury war, misses queues
[1:15:11] Lumsi2: are u playing without raging blow?
[1:15:29] relapsethegod: Thought that was the PvE build lol
[1:16:28] Lumsi2: but why skill raging blow talent but not playing it?
[1:16:42] relapsethegod: the last talent replaces it
[1:16:49] Lumsi2: no i mean
[1:16:52] Lumsi2: the modifier xD
[1:17:00] Lumsi2: under rampage
[1:17:00] relapsethegod: Lumsi the last talent he has replaces raging blow with Annihilator
[1:17:01] KikLTheSoHot: no last talante under odyn fury (it can help with cleave)
[1:17:45] Lumsi2: alright thx
[1:18:00] themanw1thaplan: I find it really sad that one has to take annihilator. Such a boring talent

[1:18:43] reedthesham: lol yes
[1:18:54] betasoldier: I think WoW would benefit from more talents like that, just reduce buttons to press for most classes. I think it'd make things a lot better for new players.
[1:18:56] reedthesham: can track it
[1:18:57] Axtin: you target it after
[1:18:58] reedthesham: like a quest
[1:18:59] Nerfmetodeath: ret has one like that too, it just removes a low impact ability so you can always be pressing higher impact its good
[1:18:59] relapsethegod: like Diablo 4 lol
[1:19:10] zachgamegodx: the raging blow spec is way less interesting anyway you just raging blow and Rampage

[3:23:29] tarth_100: people don't use instruments anymore
[3:23:29] addyz0r: It's out there. Just not mainstream
[3:23:31] BMaStream: Why don't "they" make good music? Who's they?
[3:23:33] affablebeef: I think they do, just gotta search for it a bit more, its not as discoverable imo
[3:23:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: OLD TOWN ROAD
[3:23:33] Xeliumimar: im sure if you look hard enough you can probably find it

[3:23:57] zerx_gg: This doesnt sell
[3:24:01] Luigicamp: ^
[3:24:02] illEvan11_11: i think there are people who make that type of music, it's just not popular so you dont ever hear it
[3:24:04] Nateypww: you don‚Äôt like the new ice spice?
[3:24:07] tarth_100: Good music these days is one 5 sec chorus that fits into a tic tok video
[3:24:08] zerx_gg: because
[3:24:18] Luigicamp: this never really sold though.
[3:24:18] Xeliumimar: yeah can you put on some Ice Spice
[3:24:19] illEvan11_11: cuz people care about sex drugs and crime lol
[3:24:19] Acurarx: because record companies dumbed the music down intentially to 6-7th grade level and made for social media clips like TikTok
[3:24:19] zartorak: cuz gen z loves that mumble rap
[3:24:25] Ronsimus: here is a hot take, almost nothing good has been made since 2008
[3:24:32] kusoneko: Times Change

[3:25:25] Ronsimus: @Luigicamp when it comes to music i agree
[3:25:26] tarth_100: A song has to have an addictive 10 sec hook that can be used as background in a tick tok video
[3:25:28] kusoneko: WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE
[3:25:29] Xeliumimar: Supa was 2.4 as fire mage like 3 shuffles ago LUL
[3:26:04] ivolzi: aug??
[3:26:19] Acurarx: and not to ‚Äúget political‚Äù but the labels won‚Äôt let certain artists sing their songs, so they give them to other artists instead. that‚Äôs why artists get pigeonholed.

[4:14:50] Dwilk20: It is one of those things where Aug isnt bad lol but Dev is just that out of hand in damage

[4:15:25] Xeliumimar: dev's damage is a whole other conversation

[4:28:39] Ailith21: @Falcanus no deeply rooted strictly counts casts of the ability triggering it, not procs/overloads w/e
[4:28:41] zachgamegodx: and imp prim wave
[4:29:21] Ailith21: otherwise ele sham would have perma ascendance lol
[4:30:16] kusoneko: another mana game KEKW
[4:30:25] Ambersulfr: every aug game is a mana game
[4:30:55] Falcanus: @Ailith21 ya but the wording on ptc is different, its not a "proc", it casts it an additional time
[4:31:38] fauch_922: how strong is mage atm
[4:31:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: freaking broccoli
[4:31:52] Ailith21: @Falcanus "every 4th cast of riptide also applies Riptide to another nearby target"

[4:33:48] Nateypww: take it off!!!
[4:34:24] kusoneko: how come the DH has a yellow name plate on the enemy team
[4:34:37] Ambersulfr: that's a special version of dh with extra stuns and cc
[4:34:56] Ambersulfr: it also one-taps you if you fall below a certain health threshold, it's a neat variation
[4:35:21] tarth_100: cant you just caught flame the deathmark or is that not a thing anymore
[4:35:23] Aiakos21: purge your bleeds!

[4:38:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's a dub!
[4:38:43] Ambersulfr: aug has not been bad a single time this entire season
[4:38:52] Ambersulfr: people are playing dev because it's better
[4:39:07] Ambersulfr: and it may not be
[4:39:15] Ambersulfr: I agree w/ you that it's situational
[4:39:16] notoriousztv: aug might actually be better lowkey
[4:39:16] Lathrien: aug is the least played spec. blood dk is played more in arena
[4:39:16] ibasel: why play aug when you have DH tho
[4:39:29] williwhite94: @venruki how do u like to make ur gold as a pvper
[4:39:52] feerce24: noo, i don't like aug, lose every game so people think its ass

[4:40:43] goatskull123: dh best class design best fun best best
[4:40:47] infernion: It's making me miss season 1 ret palas somehow
[4:40:53] jfachal: are you running the prescience build ?
[4:41:04] Lamatastisch: I quit after they nerfed DK but not DH. Dk needed a nerf but letting DH untouched is just delusional
[4:41:08] kusoneko: current dh isnt even close to s1 ret
[4:41:19] Secretwombatbro: i mean s1 dhs
[4:41:20] illwill132: eh i hate demo lock metas more than dh
[4:41:21] Secretwombatbro: were a thing

[5:37:14] eainzsp: i thought aug was supposed to buff and do lower dam but looks like you are pumping

[5:46:13] Frequently1: Ayy another Aug! Aug just needs its floor damage buffed, its really dumb that Ebon Might is a team buff that increases personal damage by 33%. Too drastic of a swing

[5:53:12] Stickypilloh: wait so 40% vers rest haste is the tech for aug pvp?
[5:53:33] thisisthotcaller: I wonder what the engineering bracers and helm would be like for aug
[5:53:56] sadccookie: crit is good cause crits extend ur ebon might
[5:54:00] sadccookie: by more
[5:54:59] famous1939: cap
[5:55:00] shogun2022: jellys response was funny
[5:55:16] FateIRL: yes
[5:55:17] shogun2022: poor augs
[5:55:35] worldhealer: need Jelly as DPS foir success
[5:55:35] shogun2022: pls no lol
[5:55:36] Lathrien: pepeLaugh
[5:55:42] j_rd95: top aug in EU is 2.7 in shuffle somehow
[5:55:45] gelatokush: i think its betetr that way was a big mistake adding aug in first place
[5:55:59] addyz0r: it's s tier in m+
[5:56:02] Mechgyrasaur: plz no
[5:56:04] krisdahaka: needs to be removed from the game LUL
[5:56:10] Frequently1: They just need to make it so ebon might is a 10% damage increase instead of 33%. Stupid a team buff gives you 5x more damage than ur teammates
[5:56:13] Mckenziehehe: ye I wish aug wasn't added
[5:56:25] gelatokush: yea people are playing aug in M+ as healer
[5:56:27] Mckenziehehe: highly disagree
[5:56:28] Mechgyrasaur: that's like saying they should buff prot pally
[5:56:32] sadccookie: aug was so op last saason cause u had similar burst to dev, insane utility, and crazy buffs to party
[5:56:34] itsBdaws: is there gonna be any changes for awc or just dh domination
[5:56:38] krisdahaka: KEKW
[5:56:40] koonakeenay: and dh third spec will be support demonic aug
[5:56:46] shogun2022: I think they should fix it though, I think its shitty that they leave certain classes almost unplayable in pvp, how hard would it be to fix them really...
[5:56:47] gelatokush: aug legit killed wow pvp and pve for a while
[5:56:48] sadccookie: now u have mediocre dmg and medicre buffs with good util
[5:56:50] TrippThree: Need Gladiator spec (sword and board)!!!
[5:56:51] krisdahaka: dh support class inc
[5:57:02] Frequently1: DH gonna get a LoL Vayne spec
[5:57:02] addyz0r: villain arc
[5:57:04] buffnac: now they need to add an anti Aug that debuffs so every team is required to have one or the other
[5:57:06] krisdahaka: a healing demon
[5:57:06] Mckenziehehe: true
[5:57:13] gelens1: give us healer dh bro
[5:57:16] nwafighta: abusers gonna abuse
[5:57:21] addyz0r: you said for a while. It's over. Get over it :D
[5:57:22] itsBdaws: demo lock buffs and the retpocalypse were dark times for pvp lmao
[5:57:29] worldhealer: LUL nah boomers just stared at it and said no.
[5:57:30] leeka: needs fistweaver
[5:57:31] addyz0r: more aug!
[5:57:42] xilyx2: naw.. too many people q'ing arena anyway
[5:57:46] addyz0r: aug blood fist lfg
[5:57:52] BetterknownasJohn: You mean the comp focused around making the best class in the game even better might be toxic? nah.
[5:57:56] R1_Prototype: honestly I hope at the end of this expansion chromie goes ‚Äúwow that was weird, almost like it actually happened‚Äù and magically dragonflight is deleted.

[6:04:02] Lathrien: the dutch love their liquids

[6:05:15] shogun2022: im with you jelly

[6:05:38] brewtank: but it‚Äôs staying most likely
[6:05:51] sourbutts: cant interrupt a hunter
[6:06:28] BMaStream: I'm thinking of getting precog on my MM hunter because of how many people try to kick my aimed shots
[6:06:33] BetterknownasJohn: mop marks was so fun
[6:06:43] FlyFYI: its legit a caster that doesnt have to worry about being kicked

[6:06:59] finisterra484: yes baby! sex machine yes
[6:07:13] goatskull123: I feel like survival is pretty hard
[6:07:14] shogun2022: yep
[6:07:24] shogun2022: hunters just die
[6:07:26] dismantlle: surv is squishy and has meh cleave right?
[6:07:28] ShayTime: hunter just needs to not die so fast
[6:07:39] ShayTime: hunter is prolly squishiest class in the game now
[6:07:47] Lathrien: Survival can't do as much damage at range without flayed shot, and doesn't out-trade other melee
[6:07:48] Riddle_Vizion: I think feral is absolute paper
[6:08:01] Kujo_XX: Can we see the talents?
[6:08:06] shogun2022: mop hunter was the best lol
[6:08:11] Cocoapuffs1: sv doesnt counter the bleed classes like it used too either
[6:08:35] BetterknownasJohn: mop BM with spirit beast/bond was nasty
[6:08:53] sourbutts: hes right about arcane for sure

[6:22:38] Texdizzle: ofc who turns down gambling
[6:22:39] Myth_The_Wolf: Ven, I have a question regarding PvP item priority. After weapons, should I go immediately for head/chest/legs especially for 2p/4p?
[6:22:39] gelens1: send it
[6:22:51] Texdizzle: but if you get the staff you gotta death roll someone 100k
[6:22:52] Myth_The_Wolf: Or is quick 2p/4p better?
[6:23:17] iLLwiLL_HS: unpopular opinion, frost dks go is so fucking broken buffing it would ruin pvp

[6:54:59] cadillacseville: 3.3k is equal to maybe rival in pvp
[6:55:07] dyllbarx: no its not
[6:55:12] dyllbarx: its like top 0.7%
[6:55:18] pazta9: 3.3 has to be way more than rival ye
[6:55:20] dimitridq: lmao rival

[6:55:47] Myth_The_Wolf: But the problem with comparing is that PvP rating fluctuates a lot
