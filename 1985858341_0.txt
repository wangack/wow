[1:11:15] RinD41: because i saw carn's level before
[1:11:20] Sscuzzy: so you dont see all the 60s next time
[1:11:24] Master_Prawn: There's probably an option to change it but fuck it

[3:22:52] Reticent_88: Bit of both. Better tank does more threat so DPS need to throttle less, or not at all. But a DPS overaggro is still 100% the DPS's fault
[3:23:00] Zaionara_: @0_0000000 it punishes good players and its irrelevant for bad players since they cant do enough dps to pull aggro. its a bad mechanic

[3:24:12] zkchefski: what do you want tanks to do if not hold threat?
[3:24:16] DrunkLoliOgre: There are many mechanics in classic which temporarily disable the tank so they can't gen threat too
[3:24:18] PizzaMamf: PizzaMamf subscribed with Prime. 
[3:24:18] Flashby: it's so easy to manage as well, especially with threat meters

[3:24:28] badaim5445: "Easily put, the healer dies."
[3:24:28] BriceBeNice: they took it out in cata. with aggro holding spells like target taunt and buff to threat generation stances multiplying threat by like 400%
[3:24:32] PlainWolfie: duke I did the silithus route cause I wanted to practice pvp along with farming gold
[3:24:33] shiririn_kamaya: dps crying cuz they cant manage threat xdding

[3:26:28] BriceBeNice: @StreamFollower that was because damage was getting more and more ridiculous and boss mechanics became more and more complicated. like bouncing the boss between 2 tanks was hard to facilitate before those changes

[3:28:02] ニューハーフ: tbf ff14 sort of fixed threat issue
[3:28:06] DuKeIt0uT: @fast1r1s, yeah I agree with that but I think watching a video pre fight is much harder than applying that to retail raiding
[3:28:12] ニューハーフ: but they still not fixed as off tank being useless
[3:28:14] badaim5445: @Reticent_88 thx :)
