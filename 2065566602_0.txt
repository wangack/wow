[1:00:33] ruediruempel: Echo missing count KEKW
[1:00:33] allisonkielle: Oh wonderful 4 dps in mdi makes so much sense

[1:01:06] cptrogers123: The streamers favourite thing to talk about is how annoying their viewers are LUL
[1:01:06] Goliathse: It should be full on
[1:01:07] Teddsan: thats a 9:45 for echo
[1:01:12] fleks27: echo removed the two most hated things with healers and augs and is winning - coincidence?

[1:02:36] thepanoramiks: JB is crying in corner
[1:02:43] Nox1o: its a free win in quarter finals but I doubt they were doubting their excecution to that point
[1:02:45] Raisha_Delos: Echo troll early every tourny are we surprised at this point? KEKW
[1:02:50] scorgie1994: JB is rerolling ret as we speak
[1:02:52] Goliathse: @kaible9 Thats because you dont understand the difference, this is the OG competition
[1:02:55] datewitheffi: dawgs was actually pretty close to legendarys time yesterday even with a wipe
[1:02:56] ZACKandATTACK: He's prob ret for disease dispel for Vol'kaal. They were dispelling Priest and Mage everytime to save on healing. He seems pretty comfy on slamming on ret too
[1:03:04] knersh_: vs 16 seat maybe they weren't sure of the rezan pull

[1:03:43] 3V3R357: @hopefulx
[1:03:51] TheKEK: I think that 5 auge evokers is the play
[1:03:51] Nevdok: @exomaths last hope
[1:03:51] Mezzedii: its infinite scaling so why does it matter
[1:03:52] fleks27: way more fun to watch this
[1:04:01] Nox1o: Meeres said before MDI started that it should be 25/26 otherwise its too easy, thats prob exactly what he meant
[1:04:02] KevsDream: this is way better than hard keys. 10-14 min keys is perfect.
[1:04:02] ShadowDuelist21: ^
[1:04:04] Grimm303: most fun to watch?

[1:04:25] Remery: the only thing that will make it more interesting to watch - is to bring back corruptions
[1:04:26] ruediruempel: JB salty because no healer in comp LUL

[1:04:46] spiritcheese: RageyBoom
[1:04:47] Ddemonee: Zaelia switches to dps, tops meters, doesnt elaborate, leaves.
[1:04:48] Benjg7: Jb lays in bed awake at night trying to justify playing healer
[1:04:51] captainnetz: JB watching the best team not make a mistake on a giga risky key saying to pump up the key level lol
[1:04:52] TheKEK: I can link it right now I have done a +11 ataldazar in less then 10 minutes on my prot pally

[1:05:09] Coriollis: 5x BM is too slow sadly
[1:05:09] Schaliiiiiiiii: KEKW

[1:05:16] Deatheran: Workers worrying about AI taking their jobs. same as JB worrying about DPS players taking his spot
[1:05:16] malavander: I find methodical decision-making more interesting to watch than brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[1:05:17] Buzzzcraft: right jb? THE SHADE LOL
[1:05:18] maverick812: @captainnetz HE has a lot of experience in MDI
[1:05:19] Kyrasis: Yeah, you need to keep the healer in their place; let them know they are expendable.
[1:05:23] Mezzedii: @rastaelmo *+15s i'd say
[1:05:26] ridder30: JB just wants to watch TGP, like the rest of us
[1:05:26] tehWhilson: tehWhilson subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! what do i spend all of this bread on?
[1:05:32] dustin_handsupdb: It should be hard enough to the point where you need some tech to pull everything to a boss and kill it, be it no healer, or special movement etc.
[1:05:34] GnarstyTV: Max is an expert fisherman.
[1:05:40] fleks27: just imagine having to watch a 26 throne in finals
[1:05:41] b1azzuris: tanks are irreplaceable healers aren’t
[1:05:41] fleks27: no thanks

[1:05:51] AsYouAsked: Jb's twitter thread inc
[1:05:52] koala_on_a_stick: MDI used to be the key level what people did for max ivll vault, so more people could relate with those speedy MDI runs
[1:05:53] knersh_: JB GoodTake
[1:05:56] Thrall966: @fleks27 trueee
[1:05:57] zusuu54: Echo in the mdi is like watching 2023 f1 season
[1:05:57] MightyGIGACHAD: the entire point of mdi is wild pulls in lower keys, they’re needs to be a massive difference (like there is) between mdi and TGP
[1:06:01] holymommades: I think the no healer thing is dog shit
[1:06:01] altopstra: Corpa
[1:06:03] TopicxTV: max 100% right
[1:06:05] alstadi: i think 23-24 range is perfect for mdi
[1:06:06] kaible9: @ridder30 true tgp is a much better format
[1:06:06] DanteDemonZ: what about the keys being 23-26 level
[1:06:09] bobshallot: eb Kappa
[1:06:19] knersh_: so mad XD
[1:06:19] cheep_wow: give the people what they want, 1 tank, 4 healers in a 3 hour death match
[1:06:23] radhunt: this is perfect key level
[1:06:26] Pumpflexin: GoodTake 󠀀
[1:06:29] n1ckoo: why is he so salty
[1:06:29] sheavyn: hes right
[1:06:29] gooseleee: Hey Max, do you think Echo is ahead enough to start streaming their practice? That's essentially how the RWF streams started when method felt confident enough and that has grown a lot. Or are the teams still too secretive to stream their practice?
[1:06:30] Mezzedii: wrong KEKW
[1:06:31] ZatharahTV: @koala_on_a_stick I mean its 2-4 levels off so point invalid
[1:06:31] JoshBruh: KEKW
[1:06:31] TimIsSad: healer chatting
[1:06:32] Nox1o: @zusuu54 i dont see a singapore happening anytime soon, Echo is like Max, no mistakes
[1:06:33] reggiepowa: I kinda agree with jb there
[1:06:33] TSmarine: GoodTake
[1:06:33] kaible9: the fact they don’t need a healer shows how bad mdi is right now the keys should be higher
[1:06:34] sorliee: WRONG
[1:06:35] roookai: i think it's cool if SOME keys are run no healer
[1:06:35] Morayeden: JB right
[1:06:36] ewevix: @Maximum its still hellfivers
[1:06:36] Suited_Monkey: i agree with jb

[1:06:42] NerdRagedOut: alternative strategy is healthy
[1:06:43] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: cry more jb 🤣🤣🤣
[1:06:43] ewevix: helldivers*
[1:06:43] Ditysalad: jb and max about to fight
[1:06:43] KevsDream: 100% agreed. MDI should be about speed. this seems perfect currently
[1:06:43] Naimiria: GoodTake
[1:06:44] kaible9: he’s right
[1:06:44] Sly_404: i like watching mega huge pulls on mid 20s lvls, just reminds me how useless my enhancer ass is LUL
[1:06:45] SurelyBaked: GIGACHAD “wrong”
[1:06:45] Squats3: i mean its an opinion. it cant be wrong
[1:06:46] Khiiwi: GoodTake
[1:06:47] theskot: why have healer specs at all
[1:06:48] Dhizzy74: jb based
[1:06:50] SlowboLaggins: i agree with jb but also like this
[1:06:51] nalegi07: they played 4 classes with insane levels of offhealing/defensive/on use healing
[1:06:51] Coriollis: key level is ok but the dmg on tank or group is waaay too low
[1:06:52] TopicxTV: JB is goofy, what he’s asking for is basically an easier TGP lol?
[1:06:53] SgtSmith95: As a 3200 prot pala i say fuck healers
[1:06:54] Shisk: I think there's a very big difference in "Echo not needing a healer" and "20 seed not needing a healer" and we've kinda hit that balance where we are
[1:06:56] rawmins: JB is right this is kind of boring
[1:06:56] Wonderbabe: GoodTake
[1:06:56] KobaKiLLa: bro hit that "nah id win"
[1:06:56] hacksel: i think one more affix is needed
[1:06:59] kaible9: JB is 100% right
[1:06:59] nalegi07: its not they ripped 4 rogues and a tanks
[1:07:02] duplexity_dave: There is no risk if no healing is required in the first place
[1:07:03] Cower311: healers wanna dps except when they actually gotta play a dps spec. they just want to play on ez mode
[1:07:03] BiblibobEUWest: jb based as always, max think he has never been wrong his entire life
[1:07:05] zusuu54: @Nox1o Its ferrari's year , right ?
[1:07:06] wabash412: the right key level is to make a 10-12 minute run so they can control time lol
[1:07:07] reggiepowa: this is like if they ran mechagon at 23, it would definitely be too low
[1:07:07] kaible9: this is just stupid
[1:07:08] greatangelsanguinius: No heal is cringe
[1:07:09] 10000watts: i feel like running no heal should be a huge risk, not a who really gives a fuck
[1:07:11] Castelious: wow is designed around tank/healer/dps not having one of the 3 is stupid
[1:07:11] Moterio: @Shisk BASED take
[1:07:13] AP_MISXO: jb is right
[1:07:14] sheavyn: jb correct
[1:07:15] gova17: LETS GO
[1:07:15] Alario1: yes 26 would be way better
[1:07:15] healapotamus: he’s right low enough where we don’t have to watch an boring tank
[1:07:16] Urek_: this is MDI not tgp
[1:07:17] Klako1: chat what pet do i run with destro lock?
[1:07:18] Goodnevi1: I dunno, I'm with JB, they were even completely ignoring mechanics
[1:07:19] mrcreatine123: i think its cool that if youre behind you can swap it a no heal comp. But if everyone is running it, there is no last chance
[1:07:19] wailordez: this take leads to healers just being insurance
[1:07:19] Docaan: i rather watch higher keys
[1:07:20] gregtehcow: fuck healers bro spoiled brats KEKL
[1:07:20] fleks27: yo check this twitch dm its gonna be a banger
[1:07:20] cheesey_oce: JB is right
[1:07:23] healapotamus: 5 dps!
[1:07:27] altopstra: add more aoe xdd
[1:07:30] JayPuppa: youre taking away 20% of a group by having lower keys. its silly. its like playing a hockey game without a goalie, and saying "lets see if our possession is good enough" @Maximum
[1:07:31] Nox1o: @Nox1o that ferrari looks like a early 2023 car, they giga behind. I feel Merc and AM behind RB
[1:07:31] zubulluu: Being able to no heal is more of a dungeon design thing though, some dungeons just have no damage that isn’t stopable
[1:07:32] Tsaebahcus007: Which team does Dorki play in?

[1:07:35] scorgie1994: look at Dawg's first pull. there is still a chance to brick but you can go big
[1:07:38] clearsenpai_: there are no risks at +19 nothing really one shots you at max gear, at 23-24 there are spells that can one shot
[1:07:38] healapotamus: @cheesey_oce yes he is
[1:07:39] codydoubleu: is it at the point where 2 good teams know that a 15 second lead is insurmountable because there is no way they wipe?
[1:07:39] priceytbh: 19 has no risk
[1:07:40] Mezzedii: 50/50 on if u bring healer etc is best key level
[1:07:40] TopicxTV: 26 you are not doing these pulls though…

[1:07:43] Lorrdzik: @theskot At this key level you can play with or without, cant tell which is for sure better. For me it feels more interesting than always with healer or always whitout healer.
[1:07:44] malavander: but healers watch this too, and people want to watch good players at their class demonstrate how to play well (not a healer btw)
[1:07:45] gwenmh: just increase healer damage pls
[1:07:45] Thasin22: They should just make having a healer a requirement
[1:07:45] SalmiraMH: There difference between 22 and 19 in that gear is miniscule
[1:07:46] brown_: omg JB
[1:07:47] DylanWRX: this is within the realm of being realistic for average players - they get inspired
[1:07:48] l2prandy: Key level on 1% playerbase
[1:07:49] knersh_: can't wait to see no heal grps on live XD
[1:07:50] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: its echo….
[1:07:50] lovelovelotsoflove: Bro they MAKE it look easy
[1:07:50] scorgie1994: Echo are not a fair measuring stick lmao
[1:07:52] Gobbomb: Echo is never going to look challenged JB
[1:07:53] sorliee: Jb is so salty lmao xdd
[1:07:53] kaible9: their just skipping mechanics it’s no challenge and boring
[1:07:53] hxzcc: LetHimJoel
[1:07:54] toblus123: yes
[1:07:54] kotabraun: Wiped and still were close to 11 min clear?
[1:07:54] 1RHaris: JB cookin
[1:07:55] rastaelmo: bro
[1:07:55] Grimm303: JB GoodTake
[1:07:55] Moterio: Comparing any other matchup to Echo vs anyone matchup makes no sense
[1:07:56] ridder30: I'd rather watch higher keys.  I would also rather watch a proper comp with a healer.
[1:07:56] wailordez: JB is 100% right, just makes the healer importance in question which means that role is no bueno.
[1:07:56] ShadowDuelist21: PopCorn
[1:07:57] gregtehcow: JB MALD LULA
[1:07:57] nyshindysheen: "look like" lmao
[1:07:58] Urek_: Can you mute this guy please
[1:07:58] Docaan: i agree with JB
[1:07:59] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: the best team there is
[1:08:00] nalegi07: Echo is not the rule KEKL
[1:08:00] tanahrah: plenty fucking time?
[1:08:00] TimIsSad: what is jb yapping about
[1:08:00] Shisk: Echo being challenged just means the key is farming the lower seeds surely
[1:08:01] iLLuuu: jesus what is wrong with that guy
[1:08:01] fleks27: how many channelpoints to mute the healer
[1:08:02] Themselves: jb is so cool and hot
[1:08:02] chimneybob: why is this dude getting combative?
[1:08:02] KevsDream: this other guy has turbo bad takes
[1:08:03] Donkeyen: GoodTake
[1:08:03] DunzoCD: GoodTake
[1:08:03] Teddsan: i mean shit went wrong for the other team whats ur point
[1:08:04] Cyanerd: the mdi podcast is fire
[1:08:04] primatxy: move on
[1:08:04] copterskates: "look like" lol
[1:08:05] TSmarine: JB GoodTake
[1:08:05] Dhizzy74: can jb come back for tgp or something hes salty af
[1:08:05] smolderdaddyuwu: I was the key, Echo looked sus as af.
[1:08:06] GnasherMasher: challenge andies in wow xdd
[1:08:06] reaperscarl: Mate, it's echo tho
[1:08:06] DailyBread: no becausr they prepd... but DAWGS did the same thjing and wiped...
[1:08:06] Coriollis: they had an iffy pull at start
[1:08:07] GH0STtdi: stop comparing echo to everyone else haha
[1:08:07] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: exception, not the rule
[1:08:07] miniath_: i dont think invalidating a core role of the game should be an option
[1:08:07] captainnetz: JB in a corner lol
[1:08:08] sickybean: Bench JB from this watchparty
[1:08:08] Morayeden: JB the best chef in the kitchen. Let him cook
[1:08:08] FruBMK: Jb just needs to let it go, jesus christ
[1:08:08] synfool1: JB just doesn’t like his role to not exist
[1:08:09] chimneybob: chill out bro damn
[1:08:10] Aro725: theyre the best team in the world man lmfao jb relax man\
[1:08:10] ultideath: JB is choosing this hill to die on
[1:08:13] Urek_: GoodTake
[1:08:13] radhunt: echo could have pulled bigger
[1:08:13] CptGerryM: That has nothing to do with how good some teams are
[1:08:15] VIEGAS_PT: dunno
[1:08:15] gfkoe: yeah but that's ehco
[1:08:17] MightyGIGACHAD: @fleks27 KEKW
[1:08:17] Nox1o: probably true for Echo
[1:08:18] dampbambii: jb mald and bald
[1:08:18] radhunt: they just didn’t
[1:08:18] WoX_: JB 100% right
[1:08:18] percycaria_: because it atal
[1:08:19] Muqtwow: jdot is so grumpy and washed
[1:08:20] hobit0213: JB still mad
[1:08:20] Jrbgarcia14: IT'S FUCKIN ECHO LOL
[1:08:20] Donkeyen: But Echo is also insane
[1:08:20] Nerdyindeed: echo is far beyond the other teams in the tourney lmao
[1:08:21] Popojaga: Echo just here to pick their salary at this point
[1:08:22] scorgie1994: ask JB is favourite colour then say I don't care when he answers
[1:08:22] Tgloss22: its also echo lmao
[1:08:22] hobit0213: XD
[1:08:23] Gobbomb: Just push it to a 25
[1:08:24] bobshallot: ur talkin top 1 tho
[1:08:24] TopicxTV: going up to a 26 in this key, would completely get rid of all these cool fast pulls. It would just be a weaker boring TGP.
[1:08:24] Xilles: ayaya
[1:08:25] Torsyy: OMEGALUL 󠀀
[1:08:25] tanahrah: that is a legit braindead take..
[1:08:26] the_general01: hes right. just accept it
[1:08:29] GnarstyTV: JB hasn't even reached his full power yet.
[1:08:29] Tgloss22: they are the best in the world
[1:08:31] Xilles: Xilles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! ayaya!
[1:08:31] JimmyLCFC: but its the best MDI team of all time LMAO
[1:08:32] ifuse: idk im with jb on this one...23 atal this season any week is just too easy of a key level
[1:08:32] zusuu54: @Nox1o I'd say Mclaren is close for 2nd place, but yeah dont think anyone will challenge RB this year either
[1:08:34] Bucker_: I think they can go a little higher, like 25 sure
[1:08:35] VIEGAS_PT: yes
[1:08:35] nisou033: anyone can do a 19;  but not everyone can do 23's 24's; it is entertaining to see someone 9 min someone's peak for example
[1:08:38] Alario1: he's right tho, it would be more interesting on like 25-26
[1:08:39] ThePencilShow: At what point is JB just saying he likes TGP more?
[1:08:39] ewevix: just makes any 1 healer comps look ridiculous now
[1:08:42] ToxicLG: That's also just echo diff tho
[1:08:45] hxzcc: LETSGO DAWG
[1:08:45] private_func: where's bets
[1:08:50] fleks27: yo max can you check the twitch dm
[1:08:51] DailyBread: JB JUST MAD CAUSE HIS WASHED ASS DRUID (META IN KEYS BTW) DIDNT GET PICKED UP BY ANYONE. OLDGE MAN IS OLDGE
[1:08:53] Donkeyen: I dont think Tennis is hard. Roger Federer makes that shit look easy
[1:09:00] the_general01: these are straight up live keys that im seeing people do every day
[1:09:04] riiirn: Chatting fleks my goat
[1:09:05] handcannon77: hes not wrong, no healing a key means the key level is probably too low
[1:09:10] buttholeous: pretty sure max enjoys TGP more even
[1:09:11] fleks27: aight rude...
[1:09:12] spiritcheese: but that is because of echo, and not because key level . the player´s are on another lvl YEP
[1:09:13] Dhizzy74: nah hes not, hes just complaining to complain
[1:09:15] Coriollis: thing is nothing within M+ mechanics changes with higher level just bigger nubers to be sustained by a healer
[1:09:15] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: its echo!!!
[1:09:17] zusuu54: Anyway back to mdi mister Mod
[1:09:17] Dhizzy74: most of these keys need a healer
[1:09:20] captainnetz: so repeat of season 1 where every team was complaining about how high the key levels were lol
[1:09:20] SkrrtRussel: o7
[1:09:20] fweezle: o7
[1:09:20] dartingtv: OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[1:09:20] TopicxTV: chat delusional to think these pulls can be done on a 26. it would completely get rid of the cool tech and interesting pulls/comps.
[1:09:22] Nox1o: @Nox1o looks like Newey has been cooking. Maybe later for Mclaren, they already said their car is just a start and needs upgrades, prob less bad than last year though
[1:09:22] bochiiz: well its not overnight lol, they probably practiced that
[1:09:23] scorgie1994: Eddie Hall deadlifted 500kg, are you telling me that's heavy? He just picked it right up
[1:09:24] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: not just a random team
[1:09:24] ligament_champion: RIPBOZO
[1:09:26] kaible9: @handcannon77 yup I don’t get why max doesn’t get it
[1:09:26] MoleDude: there is no right and wrong, its a subjective thing its whatever you like
[1:09:27] Diinklebeeerg: max mute jb pls
[1:09:30] kino_xo: God forbid people want challenge and fun
[1:09:30] ewevix: also problem is that tank is full sustain
[1:09:32] riiirn: ICANT
[1:09:32] rastaelmo: i think healers not useful enough rather than the key
[1:09:32] Reznr: LOL

[1:10:01] TsvDorn: ZAELIA WICKED
[1:10:01] littlegooaatt: jb is so annoying
[1:10:02] AsYouAsked: Having to watch 26-28 keys on mdi?? Naahhhh bro, we love mdi cuz we want to watch teams cook some crazy ass pull and do it.
[1:10:03] caveman2x: what is key level ?
[1:10:07] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: bench healers, so jb cries more 😂😂
[1:10:11] TopicxTV: Y’all don’t think blizzard hasn’t looked at data? its obvious that 22-24 is the range that makes MDI a speed tournament with cool tech and big pulls.
[1:10:16] Nox1o: you want a keylevel that allows for the same pulls as the current but with more risk and difficulty, so like 1-2 more max
[1:10:16] Gobbomb: some seriousness
[1:10:16] Lylsky: @caveman2x +22, bottom left corner
[1:10:17] SurelyBaked: baseg healers are still in this game?
[1:10:18] the_general01: @caveman2x 22. its just barely a live key
[1:10:19] bubblebbuutt: echo got no sand???
[1:10:20] Ditysalad: this was a better tgp season
[1:10:20] Moterio: KEKW
[1:10:25] MisterNioce: 2.5mil the entire pull. These dudes are nuts
[1:10:26] caveman2x: ah okay thanks all im blind
[1:10:28] TopicxTV: you go to 25-27 and it’s a different tournament IMO.
[1:10:30] blort___: dawg ahead
[1:10:39] Gobbomb: Dawgs ahead with one less DPS WHAT
[1:10:39] sakou59: no heal again ^^
[1:10:40] gooseleee: DAWGS AHEAD
[1:10:41] fleks27: healers malding about proof that the role is useless is always a treat
[1:10:42] gregtehcow: erm what is wrong with destro damage LUL
[1:10:43] VIEGAS_PT: ye
[1:10:44] bobshallot: its good to have harder and easier dungs
[1:10:45] OG_Kawngi: KEKW

[1:10:49] codydoubleu: didn't they do 18s in season 1 MDI?
[1:10:51] handcannon77: aint nobody can tell me that 22 fall isnt too low
[1:10:54] SossoGoMVP: oh nvm
[1:10:57] mr_kitty__cat_: Lust u noobs
[1:11:01] kelemental: It's kinda cool if they can run no heals here but they need healers for finals.  It'll make it a better viewing experience
[1:11:07] portleys: @maximum and co. Do you think having lots of teams play no healer is bad for the role?
[1:11:09] ridder30: wait, what did gingi just do?
[1:11:13] FrilleJr: dawg
[1:11:14] VIEGAS_PT: dawg
[1:11:14] SurelyBaked: they got that dawg in em
[1:11:14] sv3nds3n: The lust went wrong because of portal
[1:11:15] Alario1: Okay that pull from gingi was cool af
[1:11:16] zusuu54: @Nox1o Newey is cooking indeed. But i do believe Mclaren will be challenging
[1:11:17] handcannon77: @ridder30 pulled the dog
[1:11:19] bobshallot: gingi just pulled a puppy monster
[1:11:19] ultideath: Gingi with the sick blink, pull, alter time
[1:11:19] Keppie__: This dungeon is not made for MDI
[1:11:19] knersh_: they will play group B with the same key level next time
[1:11:19] hxzcc: LETSGO DAWGS fuck em up

[1:11:21] spookylock: whajt is that annoying ass noise that sounds like a lighter?
[1:11:23] captainnetz: what did echo miss? dont you pull the whole room at the start?

[1:11:34] azm07: Sjele pumpin
[1:11:39] TheKEK: we should have solo M+ whats the point of having a team anyways if your all doing the same thing
[1:11:40] gregtehcow: meeres on sp ? aintnoway
[1:11:46] CalculatedRH: Having to see them swap between no heal and heals with the same players is cool in itself. If Echo could've just practiced no heal everything it would be less "fun"
[1:11:49] zusuu54: @Nox1o Yep fucking finally :D
[1:11:53] Powzoar: Ooh no evokers?
[1:11:54] deluxerubber: why are you not talking abot Dawgs being faster on first trash pull with 3dps versus 4 dps
[1:12:03] mrcreatine123: growl the GOAT

[1:12:22] faleley: I wonder how they gonna heal chromie comfortably
[1:12:23] gregtehcow: @yolles didnt see last ssn
[1:12:25] KevsDream: oh my god stop talking about dungeon difficulty and no healing.
[1:12:26] Moterio: but it's not like everyone doing no heal just mows through the dung with no mistakes
[1:12:30] scorgie1994: does dwarf racial dispell this boss?
[1:12:30] Moterio: it's just echo diff
[1:12:32] tempestyn: theyre actually slower here wut

[1:13:20] wailordez: if it exist where its possible, it has to be extremely questionable. Its about the value of the healer in general
[1:13:22] VIEGAS_PT: yes
[1:13:23] BullDevil: if they are at 10% the entire time they wouldn't fuckin 4 dps it because of the risk, bad take

[1:13:27] Castelious: why does every class that's not a healer do so much healing KEK retail
[1:13:32] Aro725: this guy is fried. Its lefgit cause echo is insane. Dawgs is dying harder on this boss that echo is without a healer how do you explain that
[1:13:32] beyonddivinee: i think that's more about Echo having incredible coordination and CC'ing / interrupting perfectly
[1:13:35] knersh_: this more about pruning self heal and deffs
[1:13:39] shale93: velo doing same dps as gingi KEKW

[1:14:46] ruudolf4: im glad growl and jb arent designin classes lmao
[1:14:50] basherbash32: Do you think Echo has a sixth man telling them that they are way ahead or slightly behind?

[1:15:44] ridder30: @handcannon77 i was thinking about it the other day, if you combined the shaman utility and defensive toolkit with a hunter's it would still be weaker than a mage

[1:15:48] dustin_handsupdb: @ultideath cause we do shit damage

[1:28:33] Nox1o: ive I had a sub for every time JB talks about 4 healers, id have more subs than Max

[1:29:29] MullbertXD: As someone who casts from their spellbook, I hate the change to the spellbook ui. It's going to block so much of my screen during combat, the icons are smaller, and all the muscle memory of what's on each page will be a huge adjustment.

[1:30:03] mrcreatine123: ret gives freedom here
[1:30:07] doep20: they're putting lust on CD earlier so it comes up at the right time later
[1:30:07] zephah: holy trinity being broken because offhealing is through the roof is probably not great for the game

[1:30:15] morbid98: sjele is a fucking demon, holy
[1:30:16] Zulu_Gaming: I mean I agree with the healer take, because invalidating a whole role makes the game feel kind of dumb to me. It becomes a different game if you don't need a healer IMO
[1:30:17] Naywils: Comes back up faster
[1:30:17] Holysal: Support classes is the future
[1:30:18] cheep_wow: The higher the key the higher the skill gap matters. I like the “any given Sunday” feel of the mdi
[1:30:19] fl_am: DAWGSSS
[1:30:21] fl_am: GO DAWGS
[1:30:26] wailordez: it makes the healer role less interesting/important if you can no heal. Means design wise there was a mess up
[1:30:26] weezull: @weezull good point
[1:30:28] scorgie1994: what if the key level was a bit higher but the format was TGP. not 1v1s but you have X hrs to time these 4/5/6 keys
[1:30:29] Nox1o: echo way more sang healing
[1:30:30] Themselves: bla ?
[1:30:31] klappe92: Waaaay less sanguine healing for Dawgs
[1:30:34] Lunamhm: he has a point hes just being turbo obnoxious about it, he dont need to go on a 20 min rant about why 0 healers is bad every time xdd
[1:30:35] Naimiria: who is this sanguine healer he is nuts HOLY
[1:30:37] LucidAntics: Maybe have the ret bubble pull some and have the tank go the other way, life grip the ret into the tank and lust? idk again, talking out my ass

[2:58:37] smolderdaddyuwu: @cuore22, probably not. Tgp is next season but lot will change
[2:58:43] Team_Spanky: Max looks like he could be one of several things. A full time gamer. An amateur league hockey player. An art student that specializes in abstract sculpture. The inventor of a best selling organic, vegan toothpaste. Or a homeless guy. Its a very diverse look.
[2:58:44] Teddsan: well one got literally ddos'd
[2:58:45] Cakerinotv: @Cuore22 maybe, all these classes are pretty defensive heavy which is the biggest deal. for higher keys though aug might be a better pick which means u would probably play disc instead

[3:17:18] souledk: did you pre-record an acceptance speech? is not, yeah
[3:17:19] Archmage_Michael: what’s more important then seeing Asmongold win and also. it being there?
[3:17:20] MikeyGy: well QT pays for every person invitiedso you jsut griefd her on her money
[3:17:23] hqrriswow: I love asmon but the fact he wins MMORPG streamer pisses me off, bro is a react streamer now
[3:17:27] mrozonmrozon: gg
[3:17:35] GandyKandie: she also just talks like that
[3:17:37] mrz_as: @MikeyGy AINTNOWAY
[3:17:42] fl_am: DIRE WOLVES YEEE
[3:17:43] cheep_wow: It’s kinda the OTK awards or has been in the past
[3:17:44] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah I dont think Asmon should even be nominated (speaking as a zackrawrr viewer) as he hasn't really played any mmo's the last year
[3:17:45] fatcannoli: bad sign that she didn't ask you to tape an acceptance message
[3:17:46] harris01_: gg BloodTrail
[3:17:46] poroyou: who cares?
[3:17:56] CladeusXE: @Archmage_Michael hes not going
[3:18:01] RottenMelks: she got no sponsors this year
[3:18:02] mrozonmrozon: gg BloodTrail
[3:18:04] hqrriswow: yah she had KFC sponsor her
[3:18:06] thatsmybis: I dont really understand how asmon still qualifies as an "mmo" streamer at this point
[3:18:11] mybootyisasnack: spriest is just way better than a combat rogue at st with m+ talents
[3:18:12] NahrSnow: Best streamer to almost be completely nude w/o any shame goes to…..
[3:18:14] BigTallTrey: juked her like Driney
[3:18:15] Unosojudio: Don't let the normies tilt you xD
[3:18:16] alstadi: what's the beeping sound in the background? pretty annoying
[3:18:18] TheAngryChicken16: @RottenMelks ur lying for fun?
[3:18:19] Vrem: Vrem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:18:20] Dzor12: Agree you didn't grief her but she had no sponsers this year I think
[3:18:21] Ravaven175: I'm looking forward to Echo's "Angry" match later today
[3:18:26] Kyocere: streamer awards is lame anyway
[3:18:27] MaliciousDH: Asmon being considered a wow streamer still is a joke, guy just does nothing bu cheesy react content
[3:18:27] fl_am: WAIT
[3:18:29] Vordie: Considering how flakey streamers are, this is probably second nature to her
[3:18:30] mrz_as: SCHIZO
[3:18:30] Shisk: I mean she's gonna give the spot to someone else if he messaged her almost a week ago, but she is losing money this year i think
[3:18:31] dustin_handsupdb: I bet QT and Driney have something to talk about now.
[3:18:31] SneakyWoodPecker: just get sponsors 4Head
[3:18:31] hqrriswow: @thatsmybis amen, no hate to him but it's just kinda weird, its like calling XQC an OW streamer
[3:18:31] Blazedude99: because people who don't watch mmo streams know of him as an mmo guy
[3:18:32] fl_am: how many more games are today
[3:18:32] 324bee21: Doctor Atnos is a beast, makes even blowout and low rank games sound intense
[3:18:32] shunsha: growl stream crashed, hi max
[3:18:33] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Streamer Awards is not sustainable in the long run
[3:18:34] Nox1o: im gonna call driney QT from now on

[3:18:37] LegitGarbage89: SCHIZO beeping in my walls

[3:19:14] Vordie: oh its not the voices in my head, good
[3:19:15] ludosquoo: @ludosquoo oh Pog
[3:19:19] NahrSnow: what position do you play in hockey max?
[3:19:19] djmadi: why is no one talking about the random slow mo in broadcast replays? is that intentional?
[3:19:33] yeyanow: the asmon award
[3:19:34] ligament_champion: leaked
[3:19:35] MaliciousDH: what mmo does he play?
[3:19:36] Laffitaffi11: if you win call in from the bench in between shifts
[3:19:40] munasauna: but he doesnt even really play MMOs much anymore?
[3:19:41] pnguinwow: he really should not be an mmo streamer tbh
[3:19:41] OG_Kawngi: leaked script
[3:19:43] codethename: He doesn't even play mmos KEKWait
[3:19:45] booznoon: but hes a react streamer
[3:19:45] HoseiYamasaki: But he never plays MMOs really.
[3:19:51] Arvakr: Are u gonna play last epoch next week papa max
[3:19:53] PepikStep: who’s #2? Esfand?

[3:19:59] breekicheeki9: facts
[3:20:02] skFriberg: he'd be at 300k
[3:20:05] worldhealer: EZ
[3:20:06] hqrriswow: yeah but someone who plays MMO
[3:20:11] artzenhooo: ASMON EZ
[3:20:11] Naviih95: True
[3:20:13] Vodkaamix: sadge
[3:20:13] beyonddivinee: to me it's synanomous with bald
[3:20:14] 324bee21: he randomly plays them a couple times a year still and his opinion still holds weight
[3:20:15] JakeParkbench: Hed have more viewers reacting to the 2nd place person playing
[3:20:16] HoseiYamasaki: You're the winner in my heart Max
[3:20:17] plankdemi: you are #2 right?
[3:20:17] Tjorvarn: Construction at this hour?! Dont you guys have unions?! Angry in EU*
[3:20:18] poroyou: Do people put any stock in those rewards?
[3:20:19] sorliee: RIOT mmo comes out tomorrow and asmon got 500k viewers
[3:20:20] Onemore_time_: u forgot forsen
[3:20:21] iKreb1: and as toxic as his community is they got his back
[3:20:21] saintfrancis: asmon wont go to the awards either
[3:20:22] worldhealer: 40 yearold men love this man
[3:20:22] duckdaring: Gotta give it to Asmon. He's very intelligent and he's good at what he does.
[3:20:23] homeronio_: did dorki win?
[3:20:24] dango0n: he would have to not be nominated'
[3:20:25] DanCr0w: its a shame because you or soda both did alot this year
[3:20:25] bestewogibtyo: so the award is just about viewers or what
[3:20:25] hqrriswow: s everyday vs someone who occasionally plays a new one that comes out every few months, he deserves awards but MMO streamer is wrong
[3:20:30] Lorrdzik: @hqrriswow but people vote so it popularity contest nothing else
[3:20:37] dustin_handsupdb: Then qt should recognize the flaw in her product. But also Asmon winning probably gets more views.
[3:20:39] cheese_beaver: xdding
[3:20:40] Vodkaamix: should rename it to asmonward
[3:20:41] Slayen84: @Maximum maybe the oh ok is cuz you were gonna win the award
[3:20:46] yaugerz: but i havent seen him play it in forever tho?
[3:20:47] beyonddivinee: RWF giga for numbers
[3:20:47] yerdadselllsavon: what if the "oh. ok" was because you won it this year
[3:20:50] smolderdaddyuwu: Az is #1? Why am I in this channel??
[3:20:52] Brandonko13: If I see trailer for Halo one more time i swear im gonna scream
[3:20:53] booznoon: tbf every time i've entered his stream recently he's having a one on one argument with someone in chat with their logs pulled up
[3:20:53] artzenhooo: Esfand LUL
[3:20:55] thatsmybis: Soda popped off with HC as well so maybe he takes it
[3:20:56] pskin: pskin subscribed with Prime. 
[3:21:01] DanCr0w: soda did alot with the hardcore guild
[3:21:02] Vordie: I feel like if she limits the amount of categories you can vote in, a real winner is much more likely to emerge
[3:21:04] Joneim: xdd
[3:21:06] aerohokie: would 3 in a year make it even close?
[3:21:07] CommonJD: Soda when he plays too, I guess
[3:21:08] Flipeled: @Maximum is soda not considered an MMO streamer?
[3:21:09] hqrriswow: asmon shld be put into the just chatting category with other big dogs that wld show real fairness tbh

[3:44:15] porongochee: baseg
[3:44:16] Boreall: 15 minute raid

[3:44:19] sohjesussalva: GoodTake
[3:44:21] Topsid3r: same :D
[3:44:25] Dyllabus: so like every ff14 boss lol
[3:44:27] unholyhoit: I do agree trash is just bad in raids
[3:44:27] Hydrixi: KEKW Good Troll
[3:44:28] Wildfire_Gaming: just play ffxiv xdd
[3:44:29] buzzkill00: @Maximum it's irrelevant which dungeon they bring back now because they make changes to them, and it will depend what changes they make
[3:44:30] kaible9: yea trial was pretty good but Ulduar is goat
[3:44:31] CladeusXE: spawn yes
[3:44:31] Korupcija_: that's why tindral and fyrakk are the best bosses of all time
[3:44:33] unholyhoit: running to boss needs to go
[3:44:35] Cyanerd: Kappa
[3:44:35] JayDubbss: JB didnt have his oatmeal today
[3:44:36] QuangeI: JB stands for Just Bosses
[3:44:36] Boreall: Next he's gonna say his second favorite raid is Gruul
[3:44:38] unholyhoit: no
[3:44:40] suprefun: but then how would you sell/buy boes without trash?
[3:44:40] unholyhoit: never
[3:44:40] JakeParkbench: Imagine if you didnt need to rebuff and run the fuck back
[3:44:41] AllUKenEat: no
[3:44:41] bobshallot: why tf people saying thats a bad take
[3:44:42] Azvard: scholomance?
[3:44:49] TheRelativeGenius: Nathria purple buff!
[3:44:53] maybesomefish: how many matches still coming up tonight?
[3:44:53] yaiba69: everything he just said is why people hated argent dawn
[3:44:59] Squats3: its there to ambiance. the raids have to feel like a place in the world
[3:45:01] thatsmybis: Bedge  doing nyalotha trash put me to sleep
[3:45:01] Plague_GG: Eranog trash is the worst trash in a long time
[3:45:02] Thrall966: a lot of guilds disbanded on tindral
[3:45:02] business_man_alex: They think its helpful for adds to a boss have portionsof the raids mechanics imo
[3:45:03] MullbertXD: it doesnt make sense if the big bad evil guy doesnt have an army
[3:45:04] DorkiBurnerAccount: they are called trash for a reason
[3:45:04] lurk_e: trash needs to be more trashy
[3:45:06] piwahXD: it has to have atmosphere lol
[3:45:07] MrColvr: trash is only good when I get a BoE to sell
[3:45:07] AkillianSNJ: Boralus Harbor
[3:45:10] Coriollis: yeah trash was useful when professions mattered with mats and recepees , now is just an unwanted annoyance I can see that
[3:45:10] unholyhoit: the only trash I remember was the extremely bad trash that made raiding as unfun as it could
[3:45:10] ruediruempel: they should do stockade m+ next season
[3:45:11] GnarstyTV: WIPE CITY BITCH WIPE WIPE CITY BITCH TEN TEN TEN TWENTY ON YO TITTIES BITCH
[3:45:11] clickermekk: if they want "Theme" just make the boss room a theme
[3:45:14] Faraday5001: BatChest i love how trash makes the raid feel
[3:45:15] prisN: trash is used to demonstrate boss abilities too sometimes
[3:45:15] kadashy1: it's about the lore andys who pay the bills around here
[3:45:18] RagingFungus: if they need theme maybe they should make their raid music not trash @Maximum
[3:45:19] Korupcija_: theme is important, that's why seasonal games are good
[3:45:19] Fishbulb07: yeah gameplay last design
[3:45:22] tonynugz: trial of the crusader???
[3:45:23] bestewogibtyo: every expansion should have a togc style raid as a filler at some point
[3:45:25] Shroomztm: honestly if retail speedruns actually became a thing, people would actually like trash
[3:45:40] devillad666: what if the story and theme of a raid doesn’t necessarily need trash?
[3:45:40] FruBMK: to be completely honest; They need to get rid of these long ass raids that no one plays anymore. there's a good raid participation is tanking last few expansions
[3:45:41] druggie12: imaigne echo lose to one fo this teams it will be funny
[3:45:47] Azvard: shadowfang keep
[3:45:47] FruBMK: Raid content is just outdated
[3:45:48] Dyllabus: the should just put a bunch of optional places in raids to explore, and make it so you can enter alone
[3:45:48] ithline_sk: the theme is so true, that's why they love putting red mechanics on red floor
[3:45:50] DarkRedux: Castle Nathria
[3:45:51] feciloi: I do miss hearing rasageth voice shit talking us regards of how good it is.
[3:45:52] MCSwagdooodle: Need trash in raids for BoE's though right?
[3:45:55] shoneshaman: what is this matchup btw weekly no leaver?
[3:45:57] sLr_____: @tonynugz ToC literally is in theme. The theme of the raid is an arena where gladiators fight. Obviously there's not trash
[3:45:59] chubbytheboi: Imagine getting Halls of Reflection as m+ dung
[3:46:00] spiritcheese: xdding boe enjoyer
[3:46:05] unholyhoit: Tindral and Fyrrak having no trash is AMAZING
[3:46:05] Morayeden: truuuue
[3:46:06] chavodk: KEKW
[3:46:13] keeb_wtf: i feel like trash is important and you end up finding a way to skip it anyway if you dont want to do it
[3:46:13] unholyhoit: KEKW
[3:46:13] krisael: trash takes like, 5min?
[3:46:14] ludosquoo: they do now
[3:46:14] Aamoth: @FruBMK some raids are like that, like the before mention TOGC
[3:46:15] Thoreya: they do that a lot
[3:46:18] feciloi: Without flavour and theme there is no raid.
[3:46:18] Thoreya: in dungeons def
[3:46:29] fokare: @MCSwagdooodle make 'em drop off bosses, or maek a mini-boss with a guaranteed drop like they planned at the start of DF
[3:46:29] RenegadeHeals: trash was goated when it funded your gametime through selling boes to civilians
[3:46:31] ligament_champion: in vanilla 90% of the raid was trash
[3:46:31] thoromyr19: How it should be
[3:46:33] Thoreya: the mobs pre boss foreshadows mechs
[3:46:36] madtrade2600: trash give pacing too
[3:46:36] Shroomztm: trash is a massive rpg element tho
[3:46:37] Thoreya: for dungs
[3:46:40] Unfeasible: @Maximum I think that the mechanics should be designd to be awesome and then skinned into the theme you're using
[3:46:40] JayDubbss: raids that are themes are cool
[3:46:40] madtrade2600: and loot !
[3:46:41] fleks27: is it rude to hope this match does not go to game 3
[3:46:48] Shroomztm: you gotta dig through the dungeon before you get to the boss
[3:46:52] Coriollis: trash for Black Temple or Sunwell mattered cuz recepee, mats, gold and rep to unlock cool stuff , now its all unwanted hussle cuz is devoid of meaning
[3:46:53] Wildfire_Gaming: @fleks27 KEKW
[3:46:55] Elorfindray: Bowser does
[3:46:56] unholyhoit: @fleks27 BASED
[3:46:56] RagingFungus: give us storming a castle music
[3:46:57] thecajuncommie: molten core had rock trash and rock boss, flame trash and flame boss, dog trash dog boss....they had it way back then
[3:46:58] XadanarGaming: Trash is the best part of M+ and the worst part of Raid. Almost like people go to raid to kill bosses and people go to dungeons to kill trash
[3:46:58] lucashowmuchpain: @fleks27 no we all agree
[3:47:00] ludosquoo: i love that shit too, it would feel empty if there was nothing
[3:47:02] sednajoan: Trash used to drop good shit
[3:47:03] Fishbulb07: if they are really strong they shouldn't need that
[3:47:03] jeroome___: dont get how that sounds stupid
[3:47:05] meozart: firelands was my all time favorite @maximum
[3:47:08] antipheonixna: ok but just make it part of a boss phase then
[3:47:11] kadashy1: I think most people like that kind of stuff
[3:47:11] sheckles: i love doing trash in raids
[3:47:12] MCSwagdooodle: @MCSwagdooodle I agree, the trash should be min versions of the bosses, or do mini versions of boss abilities, and have them drop a single BoE item
[3:47:13] FruBMK: @Aamoth I think they need to move towards "harder" mega dungeons, and content needs to be released more often in smaller portions
[3:47:13] nalegi07: no trash means no BOEs
[3:47:15] srze94: trash is fine just make it easier
[3:47:15] keeb_wtf: doesn't seem stupid, that makes sense. i dont like FFXIV style raids
[3:47:16] Korupcija_: trash is not a problem, it's just spawning in front of boss on wipe
[3:47:16] DecayingPopcorn: raids were an extension of dungeons and dung without trash doesn't make sense
[3:47:22] smashhammer: which villain has no minions?
[3:47:24] unholyhoit: boss run backs on wipe is CRINGE
[3:47:25] keeb_wtf: i do like epic FFXIV music tho
[3:47:25] Starcillo: Oldge
[3:47:25] sheckles: its so fun to fucking blast trash on reclear
[3:47:25] buzzkill00: amirdrassil trash is acceptable
[3:47:27] theskot: yea i never go on reddit too hehe
[3:47:27] marfuska13: but those millions from BOE...especially first weeks of RWF
[3:47:28] Kerelinn7: trash is good for going afk inbetween bosses
[3:47:29] Coriollis: @nalegi07 bosses can drop a BoE np
[3:47:30] DrQuackzalver: once you start compromising on theme, when do you stop? because at one point you're fighting cubes in grey tunnel
[3:47:30] Joneim: MY IMMERSION
[3:47:30] matrix1587: MY IMMERSION Smadge
[3:47:31] reymargera: BBoomer
[3:47:31] andrellius: i meant its still an MMO
[3:47:34] Cuore22: Some trash is fine - but it should be fun. There's shouldn't be anything annoying like invulns or heals that must be stopped or it makes trash go much longer. That's bad.
[3:47:34] ligmalolkekw: A LOT of people life lore and immersion
[3:47:35] Wildfire_Gaming: this poor matchup is to decide who gets absolutely blasted by echo
[3:47:36] BGsFOG: triggered
[3:47:37] ShaggySummers: high end players not liking rpg, I'm shocked
[3:47:37] spiritcheese: trash is the moment, we can trash talk in Raid YEP
[3:47:38] father_tito: docLeave
[3:47:39] ahri_feet_connoisseur: That feels really clinical and boring tbh
[3:47:42] Trodenskjold: @smashhammer doofenshmirtz
[3:47:43] maybesomefish: since raids don't have timer like m+, trash is just fucking pointless. raids have been about bosses since day one, regardless of boe drops. trash scaling options: like it was for noob guilds back in aq/naxx, a FREAKING CHORE OF A LIFETIME, or just the "we'll clear this with half raid afk and the other half cursing half of the raid being afk"
[3:47:44] meozart: firelands was my favorite @maximum
[3:47:44] ithels: or just make it once you kill that boss you get a respawn/portal to the next boss so u can pick to do trahs or skip
[3:47:44] feciloi: Trash is cool as fuck, fuck people who just want portals to boss rooms which are all final destination.
[3:47:44] prius_tv: Raids shouldn't have trash. dungeons are fine. But raids should just be big hard boss fights. idk.
[3:47:45] nerefwow: HARDC OMEGALUL RE
[3:47:45] Cakerinotv: true
[3:47:46] chimeraxst: @Maximum if you look at LFR lots of ppl do raid just to kill trash for BoE so maybe the player base likes killing hordes of trash rather then a raid boss
[3:47:47] Zerokinz: when is half my raid supposed to afk and smoke if theres no trash
[3:47:47] toique: aren't all the bosses before the final boss technically his defences
[3:47:49] Onyo1337: not sure about that, I think even civs hate when tehy go over board on trash (abberus)
[3:47:50] Rapunzele: HC is trash
[3:47:52] Pa1ntank: The trash was the friends we made along the way
[3:47:52] ludosquoo: classic andy KEKW
[3:47:53] matrix1587: classic trash is soooooo bad
[3:47:56] DorkiBurnerAccount: goddamn classic andy
[3:47:58] thegrt13: because it mattered. there were stakes.
[3:47:58] EnforcerGL: really 400 pulls… you know in classic hardcore you only get 1 chance. just another reason why classic is inherently harder than retail (baby mode)
[3:47:59] gloomygl: Fucking classic andy man
[3:48:01] dumnerd: classic
[3:48:03] unholyhoit: classic ICANT
[3:48:06] Tainted0ne_Tv: The trash in trial of the crusader was the best they ever had
[3:48:08] fleks27: classic andies treat trash as bosses (it doesnt do anything)
[3:48:09] magikadehex_: raids are trash :)
[3:48:11] Coriollis: everyone hates trash , just nowdays is devoid of meaning
[3:48:11] Cakerinotv: growls take is actually correct this time
[3:48:19] feciloi: Good
[3:48:21] feciloi: Dont get rid of it
[3:48:22] Krazekazooie: I think trash is a nice decompression period after hard bosses. Just mindless aoe pump to interlude high focus fights
[3:48:22] fetzelscr: ff14 is too far in the other direction tho, you literally just spawn infront of the boss and zone into all the bosses from the same spot so theres 0 feeling of going to a palce and "raiding" it
[3:48:23] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Is there an MMO where there isn't trash in raids
[3:48:25] CladeusXE: for HC it makes sense for death clips
[3:48:27] Onyo1337: I feel like amirdrassil trash is fine
[3:48:27] numnumss: i like the idea of trash just cause it makes the game feels more alive, not so much i like having to kill it x.x
[3:48:31] unholyhoit: they can keep their trash but running back to boss is just bad
[3:48:35] MCSwagdooodle: Imagine being the HEROES and dying to some trash mobs mmHmm
[3:48:35] ShaggySummers: High End Competitive Players don't care about the MMO OR the RPG part. They want the competition part.
[3:48:37] Faiyon: Raids would feel weird without trash. Not saying it's good just wouldnt fit imo
[3:48:40] m_dep: so many casuals enjoy the "vibe" of raiding more than the gameplay of raiding
[3:48:43] m_dep: probably majority
[3:48:49] fleks27: the jump directly to the dog to skip trash OMEGALUL
[3:48:51] bestewogibtyo: i would hold on to trash but reduce it by a significant amount. a little bit of downtime between bosses is nice
[3:48:51] Stoneownz: i think having a healthy amount of trash makes sense. Sanctum was m+ in raid...
[3:48:52] basherbash32: Dorki tandem dumping with Crypt
[3:48:52] nalegi07: sepulcher trash was gross
[3:48:54] unholyhoit: NO TRASH
[3:48:59] rastaelmo: BOEs
[3:49:02] Fishbulb07: no trash
[3:49:03] suprefun: NO TRASH NO BOES D:!
[3:49:03] maybesomefish: HC trash has a point since there's serious shit at stake
[3:49:04] Mr_Mittons: Adge
[3:49:06] feciloi: The game is not made for top 1% thank christ so thrash is here to stay.
[3:49:07] numnumss: put it in lfr thats genius
[3:49:07] ArjanaEU: But now make the trash drop boes
[3:49:08] OsyrissTV: BoEs
[3:49:08] maybesomefish: but otherwise, just fuck it
[3:49:09] CladeusXE: HC death clips are so funny
[3:49:09] tonquin2: Just make mythic not have trash lol
[3:49:11] Kyocere: hot take togc greatest raid
[3:49:11] Naimiria: BASED dorki
[3:49:12] malnourish_: i like a bit of trash to break things up tbh
[3:49:14] NilocAfterDark: boe
[3:49:14] keeb_wtf: trash takes like 10 mins and the vibe is good
[3:49:15] ItMeMatt: 0/100 goes hard
[3:49:15] Rapunzele: I mean if yo uwant that why are you playing Final fantasy
[3:49:16] Faraday5001: Tindral and Fyrakk are the best bosses of all time cos you can just release and insta respawn in front of them
[3:49:17] GnarstyTV: trash door is easy bot detection
[3:49:21] unholyhoit: who gives a fuck about BOEs KEKW I haven't gotten one this expansion
[3:49:21] Crimzoned: i mean trash is just added for the fantasy of a 'raid' it would feel like some testing ground for bosses without it
[3:49:23] Cakerinotv: 32 inch owns
[3:49:23] empasempa: WAIT echo lost???
[3:49:27] Coriollis: bosses can have boe on mythic
[3:49:31] Lorrdzik: @Kyocere you are too late it was JB take earlier
[3:49:32] drakeshaa: kekw
[3:49:32] Wildfire_Gaming: @empasempa YEP
[3:49:52] deviljin____: As devs, You never fall for the trap WoW community tries pull off. If you cave in to 50% of casuals and their demands, now the other 50% will complain at your solution
[3:50:02] Slaitz: Maybe do the trash once, and if you kill the boss after the trash, you can skip that trash always
[3:50:12] Carelezz: with out harder trash raids woud just be meha dungeons
[3:50:14] smolderdaddyuwu: @empasempa yeah. They play the winner of date night/ levels match
[3:50:18] crudolol: there is a addon to get the camera away even more then with the command
[3:50:19] albojah: I only listen to Bellular because he is a game developer
[3:50:20] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @deviljin____ yet casuals comprise of realistically 90% of your playerbase
[3:50:29] deadxtube: 99
[3:50:32] deadxtube: 99%
[3:50:35] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah probably even more
[3:50:46] PolishBunny: @crudolol nope, 2.6 is max
[3:50:46] deadxtube: most players dont even step past half the mythic rai
[3:50:55] deviljin____: @deviljin____ I'm talking about 50% of casuals, not 50% of general player base. Because we do realize not all casuals want same things either right
[3:50:56] lucashowmuchpain: looking at the sky for explosiv was a vibe
[3:50:59] maybesomefish: or maybe just include one or two trash gauntlets/events as a "boss" per raid that reward actual loot?
[3:50:59] lastericalive: most players dont step into heroic
[3:51:04] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[3:51:11] lucyftb: dratty looking fire today
[3:51:18] Thdlock: remember casuals dont have takes baseg
[3:51:19] Pumpflexin: looking
[3:51:35] hogbruhh: most players have difficulty clearing half of heroic raid sadly
[3:51:35] mrduckytom: @Thdlock emoboy is here :p
[3:51:41] sickybean: whats the reason they all banning rise?
[3:51:45] Swordish__: "Bring back grinding azerite for 20 hours a day"
[3:51:48] Kyocere: explosives troll aoe dmg like crazy. screw them
[3:51:50] stagpul: WideTHD
[3:51:50] deadxtube: smolderon is literally still a wall boss to most players (heroic)
[3:51:53] Rapunzele: you're a healer stop doing dmg and do your job
[3:51:54] Zingerac: wait date night won after the wipe
[3:51:55] Cakerinotv: healers either do literaly nothing or like everything theres no in between
[3:52:06] happyfunrockk: @Thdlock my take is you look like Joe from Teen Mom 2.
[3:52:13] Thoreya: yoo..s4 just have tyran/fortified and bring back encrypted. automatic best season
[3:52:15] ShaggySummers: Do you assume you guys would care if this was no longer an MMORPG @Maximum ? I feel like this call encapsulates people who basically only want the instanced content.
[3:52:19] ItMeMatt: lowkey I want to see these teams try throne
[3:52:37] fire127: wb peepoHappy

[3:57:20] DanKnee16: No BS, hellofresh is great. Taught me alot of cooking skills, cheaper than takeout, and someone with kids I don't have to think about what to do. Max didn't pay me to say this
[3:57:21] Naimiria: gambit last boss was BASED
[3:57:25] cookie41692: itt's funny to me how max is trying desperately to keep an optimistc outlook on things even when they're not ideal, and he keeps holding back the tide of salt and cringe coming from everyone xD
[3:57:26] handcannon77: replace rise with gambit, rise is the worst key ive ever experienced in m+
[3:57:33] Wonderbabe: Ruby last boss ?

[3:57:53] Petarglio: We all know bonemaw is the goat
[3:58:14] handcannon77: @AshinaNoble thats definitely a take...theres been quite a few DF bosses that have been awful
[3:58:44] maybesomefish: tazavesh was one hell of a banger, but oh boy the typical pugs there were just pain in the fucking arse
[3:58:45] Croizlol: i loved mueh'zala
[3:59:01] sheytanka: A lot of SL bosses were goated

[3:59:02] fleks27: last boss lost city of tolvir - like or dislike xdding
[3:59:03] Critmaw: gambit was a W
[3:59:04] WeldyyDT: the worst thing about academy was when the bird boss wouldn't spawn and would just deplete your key

[3:59:28] mishka_with_puppies: it’s a crime the pirate dragon was never a mount
[3:59:30] Thrall966: gambit was insane
[3:59:31] Swiftly8425: what is gambit?
[3:59:33] OsyrissTV: OUR CAPTAIN IS A DRAGON????!?!?!
[3:59:41] yeyanow: or like a molten armor thing, where the raptor piles lowers his defense so you had to balance lowering his deference and pulling too many adds
[3:59:42] Kerelinn7: I love the dragon boss in gambit

[4:15:39] Isonmat: what key level is this? are they still doing 23s like in time trials?
[4:15:48] Korupcija_: how many guilds died on tindral KEKW
[4:15:53] MusiRL: @Isonmat bottom left fam
[4:15:54] Wrobeleski: Wrobeleski subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:15:59] Nox1o: @Squats3 thats because they aint on a voice call with him yet
[4:16:00] B3RBAT0V: done with helldivers?
[4:16:02] maybesomefish: @jordzkie05 or vanilla's 'mana conserve' and 'emergency monitor' features in addons. you could heal raids with basically /follow and onebutton-raidhealing
[4:16:05] BadManners_: yes
[4:16:07] storm7elemental: tindral the guild destroyer
[4:16:13] Rinehartgaming: Is there a metric to see how many guilds tindral took down?
[4:16:14] Shpackeesh: is the m+ stream ma quality
[4:16:17] kino_xo: One shot mechanics are fine as long as it's fair
[4:16:18] Dzor12: Rumor is that Tindral is getting another nerf on Tuesday @Maximum
[4:16:19] Svarok_NA: 1 person fucking up wiping the raid is fine if theres not so much rng and things are more choreographed
[4:16:19] nerefwow: PepeLaugh raid talk
[4:16:20] Isonmat: @musirl ty didn't notice that
[4:16:29] Onyo1337: I remember reading tindral 20 pull boss now ICANT
[4:16:32] m_dep: 100%, one mistake shouldn't wipe the entire raid (am a raid enjoyer)
[4:16:43] thatsmybis: Yea like Xanesh was a stupid easy fight with  1 goofy mechanic that just screwed everyone. Not fun
[4:16:48] VRVento: what the MDI really needs is Taylor swift. just like she made the Super Bowl relevant along with the chief’s she can help the MDI. viewership
[4:16:53] gyser13: Raiding has become requiring more effort then its worth.
[4:16:54] knersh_: one hit wipe mechanic are bullshit
[4:16:55] thereal_LG: Tindral went from like borderline impossible to a 300-400 pull boss for most 2 day late tier CE guilds
[4:16:58] storm7elemental: leave one person raid wipes to lost ark
[4:17:05] BadManners_: fyrakk prog is waiting for the right people to get blaze and not hit the adds for us ICANT
[4:17:06] gyser13: The amount of effort for the reward is kinda ass
[4:17:07] clickermekk: im with JB on this take tbh
[4:17:08] NasDa_: @Zavian94 wondering this too
[4:17:09] TL_izPanda: Curious if JB would rather it take a guild of his skill level 2-3 months to clear or if he would prefer it take 3-4 weeks
[4:17:13] Bark3r: @VRVento KEKW
[4:17:13] Nevdok: @m_dep I think it's fine as long as it's a mechanic everyone gets. Wiping bc your healers can't dispel properly on tindral as a mdps just feels awful
[4:17:16] m_dep: if it was like a shitton of damage to heal through or something maybe, like there should be a way to respond to the mistake
[4:17:23] nerefwow: ..........
[4:17:27] gloop1: ya idk
[4:17:30] maybesomefish: JB's got a point indeed
[4:17:40] jordzkie05: i mean if it's mythic last 3 bosses? sure let 1 guy fuckup wipes the raid
[4:17:49] GeGeeWellPlayed: the point of a mechnic like that is that all 20 people should be preforming up to the point that they should wipe to that
[4:17:52] Cakerinotv: its so hard to find good players who dont hold back your raid. its def frustrating but like thats part of raiding imo
[4:17:54] jordzkie05: first 2-3 seems too much
[4:17:54] Spinerek: so want you just want to carry bad people? boss is not even hard then or
[4:18:05] saturatedfatirl: saturatedfatirl subscribed with Prime. 
[4:18:06] iKreb1: the worst thing is pugin and having a healer fk the group cause he pressed his dispell because his ui started glowing
[4:18:06] knersh_: tindral or holondrus was to hard
[4:18:06] Drenwow: I just woke is dorki playing against echo in the upper finals?
[4:18:08] splashz0r: would prefer super easy tiers + 1 ultimate style boss separate from mythic
[4:18:12] serekitten: there shouldn't be no way for it to happen but it shouldn't be as easy as it is now for it to happen
[4:18:18] MusiRL: @Drenwow echo in lower bracket so no
[4:18:19] toique: bring back 10/25
[4:18:25] Archerone: Its fine if sometimes one person can wipe, but its when its always a risk most of the fight
[4:18:25] Joneim: F
[4:18:30] Korupcija_: remove gear from mythic, give everyone that clears the raid a mount
[4:18:31] holla____: xdd
[4:18:33] Daxtez: o7

[4:18:48] Kalinea01: RIP
[4:18:54] Spinerek: @korupcija_ holy zased take
[4:19:05] vente97: make the dps check so tight dying is gonna make it impossible for world first guilds and then just adjust the hp for later guilds?
[4:19:16] ahri_feet_connoisseur: just have no punishment YEP
[4:19:16] Shadowya: problem that LA has
[4:19:22] NasDa_: does anyone know that weakaura or addon that shows the death alert and what the person died from? 󠀀 +1
[4:19:26] ludosquoo: yea but how do you design that with gearing in mind
[4:19:27] Onyo1337: you will probably wipe but you can still progress the boss
[4:19:31] Onyo1337: instead of insta wipe
[4:19:37] Limepaste: Classic has things like Debuffs. and enrage checks. where its not really a wipe if dmg is good enough, but the debuffs can slow us
[4:19:38] dahyyun: @Shadowya what problem
[4:19:38] ThoseCrazyGuys: Like getting hit by a smolderon ring
[4:19:44] Armagaren: not being able to SEE the rest of the fight even if you know you're going to wipe is so much better than just exploding
[4:19:45] ahri_feet_connoisseur: instead of wiping why not just wipe your ass instead so you can have a clean butt for the next pull
[4:19:52] Deyndra: raid proc continues
[4:19:58] Shadowya: @Shadowya raids jsut having insta deaths in raid whe n1 person fucks up
[4:20:05] itsHakooh: these teams are farming KEKW s
[4:20:08] GnarstyTV: did 2 people just die to the taser boys?
[4:20:12] Coriollis: we all disc priests now xd
[4:20:23] gyser13: I know plenty of people who refuse to raid since m+ rewards close enough gear and if they added a way to get raid trinkets they would not even pug the raid
[4:20:23] Cakerinotv: its all just based around healing cds,
[4:20:26] niko_is_bad: Adge
[4:20:27] jordzkie05: shit, modern games stopped having healers already
[4:20:31] Spinerek: j dot b raid takes I'M READY

[4:20:50] thatfriggindude: @Maximum What do you think about releasing Mythic raid first, then lesser difficulties the next week? A way to get rid of degenerate split gameplay?

[4:26:55] fallb4me: only way to fail this is if no one cleans
[4:26:56] mino661: people in low keys dont soak
[4:26:58] Ravenlynnwolf: its just ground clear if they dont clear it sucks
[4:27:00] duhworks: ppl dont know how to clear pools
[4:27:00] jcadd_: some people dont know how to drop pools
[4:27:00] GandyKandie: on 27s people firefight, on 20s, they do not
[4:27:01] Smiliereu: Last boss in Tides is so easy
[4:27:02] Cakerinotv: if you miss a soak you lose
[4:27:03] fleks27: chat just sucks with cleaning the floor after pissing on it - similar to rwf events
[4:27:03] jonpelf: under 23s ppl still forget to soak ink

[4:27:09] ciraxa: its cancer in pugs because people dont drop the 3 aoes properly
[4:27:11] Lenzoface: on low keys ppl dont manage the pools
[4:27:15] SlowboLaggins: this last boss is easy if people actually clear correctly
[4:27:16] spoicwub: It's a skill issue boss: you clean the pools and it's easy, or you don't and you wipe
[4:27:21] StoringStories: low and mid keys kill the ads all over the place so it becomes impossible to clear
[4:27:23] TheRelativeGenius: yes
[4:27:26] the_great_simonator: that boss was hard at the start of the season cuz no one had any idea what they were doing
[4:27:26] Firenze32: no lol more like 20s
[4:27:26] sector_warlock: yeah people dont clear right and people drop the ink in random spots instead of near where the adds already dropped it lol

[4:27:28] BLACKFOOT_TN: Bro you do this boss in higher keys. In lower 20s and lower. This boss is hellscape in pugs.

[4:27:38] holmat: it grows infinite over a 4 min fight
[4:27:38] Cakerinotv: you miss a single soak and you wipe
[4:27:38] Emobolts: go do it in a 18 on a under geared toon and see what they saying
[4:27:39] Smiliereu: in lower keys
[4:27:42] nyshindysheen: max pug abunch of +18 with low gear

[4:28:18] MBG_95: it does work
[4:28:20] OmmyPlays: I had a hunter stand still the entire fight and not soak in a 25
[4:28:25] oresties: I see so many randoms run that shit as far away as they can and it just grows and grows and doesn't get taken care of. Then you all of a sudden have no where to stand.
[4:28:26] Slapsstick: thats what i try and do, it works most of the time
[4:28:28] unholyhoit: it one shots
[4:28:34] huk42: you can LOS the puddles so they don't spawn, skip a series and clear
[4:28:35] Smiliereu: @OmmyPlays HuntarD*
[4:28:37] xxMaverick: personals in lower keys KEKW
[4:28:40] huk42: it's possible to recover always
[4:28:41] DavidsonWrath: the puddles infinity spread unless they are removed entirely
[4:28:45] janken4: flex
[4:29:04] fallb4me: wipes are usually to lightnins boss or totem boss
[4:29:06] KillUAssie: no they wipe in the hallway before boss
[4:29:08] gonzi86: nah, still a problem in 23-25 in my experience
[4:29:09] KillUAssie: every time

[5:30:12] Coriollis: LFM - Weekly - nO lEaVeR
[5:30:14] Ravaven175: I remember watching MDI and a team was doing the standard +2 route pulling and made it to Spires of Ascension
[5:30:22] blackbogh: Honestly these guys deserve to get eliminated for playing this greedy. I don't get why they gotta do all these MDI pulls instead of just playing it safe. I have plenty of experience in +23s, and I can say that going chill 1 pack at a time is more than enough to time the key. Just play smart and get your io.
[5:30:35] sorliee: no
[5:30:38] CloudyHS: no lmao
[5:30:38] MVPBuster: no
[5:30:38] Kurtisthelol: legendary is also 3 mins ahead

[5:30:46] Wildfire_Gaming: is this weekly keys?
[5:30:46] Fallen_o7: tott
[5:30:47] baderg66: rise
[5:30:47] MightyGIGACHAD: brh owns, big pulls big dam
[5:30:49] teramil: throne
[5:30:50] SomefinWicked: Does BRH Archer Stream PvP? I heard MM does good dam
[5:30:51] ErichBM: rise is

[5:30:55] VRVento: its to easy to be the worst dungeon for the season
[5:30:56] weezull: there's rise lol
[5:30:57] Kurtisthelol: chat is right, to prove your innocence you gotta leave the room and there cannot be a dc
[5:30:57] sneakerplayy: its just 1 pull into boss into 1 pull into boss
[5:30:57] magikadehex_: rise is the worst
[5:30:59] SoulEdg3: not wiping would be a cool decision
[5:31:01] goblingher: ToTT live keys
[5:31:03] BiBaButzeBenne: @Maximum from a MDI viewing experience and seeing some cool diverse strats, does a particular dungeon come to mind which you would love to see back in a season? thinking of mega monster pulls in vault of the warden for example
[5:31:04] xpert_demon69: BRH tyran is a fave for me
[5:31:05] deviljin____: Growl's theory checks out, throne is hardest, people say throne
[5:31:08] Ddemonee: To dispatch the allegations youd have to leave your desk and have Lepan not DC
[5:31:10] Thrall966: throne is so linear
[5:31:13] suprefun: and running
[5:31:13] Keppie__: We havent even seen rise yet
[5:31:14] CloudyHS: Bedge
[5:31:15] Goodnevi1: waycrest has been a complete ban, that has to win worst
[5:31:15] jondbr: rise????
[5:31:16] nealeyy87: is growl a civilian?
[5:31:20] OmmyPlays: dark heart is the worst dungeon to play though
[5:31:22] Monsuno: Waycrest is the worst. Camera sucks. Tree boss is mega cringe.
[5:31:22] vente97: halls KEKW
[5:31:23] murloc_oracle: and in the end the team going weekly route will win because crazy shit wipes in ToTT
[5:31:25] kj01a: oh itll be fun the watch throne on mdi, but its terrible

[5:31:40] theskot: just dont go in instantly
[5:31:40] Zyrillus: I'd take BRH over either time dungeon.
[5:31:41] TheRelativeGenius: I dislike routing this season overall, there are too many W dungeons and too many mandatory packs...
[5:31:41] panta_xdd: gauntlet savant baseg
[5:31:42] larkhill: gauntlet olympics would be hype
[5:31:49] guynormally: rogue stealth sprint up there
