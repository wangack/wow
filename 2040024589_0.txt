[0:19:27] cyndi247: HeyGuys KomodoHype
[0:20:24] dawsonator171: you got two leggos available to help Kappa
[0:20:36] cyndi247: will 1 week be enough time to get used to the changes before AWC?
[0:21:12] SsatanSpeedsUp: mes who do you think about this?. Cloth specialization classes now gain an additional 35% armor in Arenas and Battlegrounds. Plate specialization classes now have their armor reduced by 30% in Arenas and Battlegrounds.
[0:21:22] cyndi247: thatâ€™ll make it interesting I guess ðŸ˜‚
[0:22:17] tooch2: can you get leggo from the vault?
[0:22:17] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:22:20] Fueldx: Warriors got dicked hard
[0:22:52] boltozor: how dare you have a calm and rational reaction to the upcoming changes instead of expressing outrage LUL
[0:23:41] cyndi247: mes is always calm â€¦ itâ€™s one of the reasons I like this stream ðŸ˜‚
[0:24:16] dawsonator171: do you wanna test out the leggo with me in arena on dk tonight?
[0:27:41] c0jaK: gm
[0:27:49] americanmoses18: go mes go
[0:28:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: RMP could be kind of awful to face again
[0:29:12] krome2dadome: yoooo
[0:29:15] krome2dadome: dude
[0:29:35] krome2dadome: been gearing my ret today. that shit is gonna be busted on tuesday lmao
[0:29:37] dawsonator171: let me rephrase. do you want to help me enjoy it.
[0:30:10] americanmoses18: u got leggo? @dawsonator171
[0:30:30] dawsonator171: because all I get to play is one shot comps with brett as frost. And I feel like it's more fun into damp.
[0:30:35] disquared: !wa

[0:31:14] StreamElements: JustTaki just raided the channel with 11 viewers PogChamp
[0:31:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was thinking about it, and glass cannon mage is going to be a bit less glass and a bit more just cannon. Whether that's enough to make a real difference, I don't know
[0:31:31] americanmoses18: heres for you ðŸ–• @dawsonator171
[0:31:34] JustTaki: HypeCool mesZerk2 HypeCool mesZerk2 HypeCool

[0:35:38] krome2dadome: @dawsonator171 cant believe u stole my ret's lego wtf
[0:35:44] dawsonator171: there's no way with that few kills after everyone worked so hard it shouldn't be mine
[0:35:45] americanmoses18: you shud feel like shit @dawsonator171
[0:35:47] avenueone: i was saved the kill u got it i couldnt have gotten anything
[0:36:15] eMBeaR64oz: ret privileges

[0:36:27] eMBeaR64oz: so then i stopped XD
[0:36:46] krome2dadome: @eMBeaR64oz ret is gonna be fucked
[0:37:06] americanmoses18: RET IS FINE
[0:37:42] avenueone: the seething flames part of ret is dispellable
[0:38:25] krome2dadome: currently playing at like 2.1 mmr on ret in 75% greens and no enchants
[0:38:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mr. Lava Lava
[0:40:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: That big bar at the top of the breakdownb buffed by 20% should be nice
[0:40:55] eMBeaR64oz: @dawsonator171 more like Dodginator
[0:41:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Final Verdict damage increased by 10%, I had to check to be sure
[0:43:17] eMBeaR64oz: not sure if theres another healer/dps combo that feels as bad as hpal ret on same team
[0:43:17] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:43:52] Begasaur: evening

[0:45:31] artsskeit: bullying that ele
[0:45:32] artsskeit: shame.
[0:45:52] artsskeit: -ragnaros
[0:45:53] artsskeit: ah
[0:46:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Training the blue has been a thing, they gotta expect it
[0:47:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: If ele does have the most armor in PvP, that should help in some way, making them a not-as-great target
[0:48:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that guy is blasting

[0:49:01] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[0:49:36] c0jaK: drop dn on them
[0:50:32] Cephqt: Hi Mes
[0:51:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: 90 rating, nice
[0:51:33] krome2dadome: @notmes check cord real quick it's important
[0:51:37] Cephqt: is the unholy doom and gloom on the DK discord warranted for tuesday?
[0:51:40] Cephqt: your thoughts?
[0:52:00] krome2dadome: it's gonna be busted bro
[0:52:36] Fueldx: Do you think every comp will have outlaw rogue in it for tournament
[0:52:37] yowholusted: who knows which addon shows the 1/2/3 over enemy nameplates in arena?
[0:52:58] Cephqt: about the dmg nerfs and the plate armor nerf
[0:53:05] Cephqt: dmg nerf isnt as bad as the plate nerf i suppose
[0:53:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: On face value, seeing nerfs is always a bad feeling
[0:53:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, and that health could be very nice
[0:54:10] krome2dadome: i actually dont know what ret/dh will lose to on tuesday. outside of MAYBE like outlaw/arcane
[0:54:44] Cephqt: yeah think that change is pretty impactful
[0:54:55] Vigi9413: those are huge ret buffs
[0:55:28] Cephqt: so last solo shuff i had 5mil Necro Wounds healing, a 25% nerf is 1.25mil
[0:55:31] Cephqt: an entire health bar basically
[0:55:39] Senzn_: for sure going to see a lot of caster cleaves
[0:55:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: I agree it's more of a tuning and not a nerf into the ground
[0:57:41] krome2dadome: i could see rdruid weaving boomy form wraths all game with a melee cleave being disgusting
[0:57:50] anmusallam: good evening mes
[0:58:38] SebboTheFro: Even if DK pulls out alright here, I feel like Clawing Shadows might be dead sadly, thoughts?
[1:00:31] anmusallam: so can we still play claw :)
[1:00:35] anmusallam: becuase i like it more
[1:00:39] swolecolemole: im gonna have to meme with a double mastery embellish, just to counter the nerfs
[1:00:55] SebboTheFro: Yeah yeah Im not even that upset about the DK changes in general, its more that I truly just loved the clawing build for its versatility
[1:03:51] anmusallam: still makes no sense how clothies have more armor than plate
[1:03:51] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:03:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Being more durable with more time to react is going to help out quite a few players, I think
[1:04:55] krome2dadome: warrior NODDERS
[1:04:56] xkinxl: howdy howdy friend
[1:05:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Demo could probably lose some armor out of that, yeah
[1:05:16] SebboTheFro: Not a fan of the extra armor for arcane mages either lol
[1:05:27] Cephqt: i hope they unnerf blood strike or will of the necropolis
[1:05:49] krome2dadome: they did it with shaman
[1:05:51] krome2dadome: rsham
[1:05:53] JustTaki: maybe they just don't want armor to be a factor
[1:05:54] anmusallam: i have a question, i see wrath and dk is pretty tanky. has it always been this squishy against physical. i started playing wow in 8.3
[1:05:58] krome2dadome: specifically nerfed its armor
[1:06:17] neskox: do you think dk damage will suffer a lot?
[1:07:10] JustTaki: yeah they are going to end up overbuffing our magic defense
[1:07:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK is a crazy vampire tank
[1:07:40] anmusallam: you think dk stances should come back
[1:07:41] redrum4209: @notmes can you explain how my dk got hit by 3 control lava at once? does ams make it proc on you?
[1:08:55] redrum4209: oh so my healer killed me, i thouhg it hit the person that dispelled not the one they dispelled on
[1:09:24] JustTaki: They could also just straight up revert the nerf on improved Death strike or will of the necropolis
[1:10:10] anmusallam: @JustTaki they will never do it because they never fixed the will of the necropolis bug
[1:10:36] mapitom7: whats the rating? :D
[1:11:44] anmusallam: and i really miss old spellwarding talent, i hate the current iteration
[1:12:35] JustTaki: oh T.T
[1:12:46] anmusallam: but thats really lame
[1:13:05] anmusallam: death strike is already limited by disarms and immunities
[1:13:08] JustTaki: then why nerf our dam ughh
[1:13:12] JustTaki: lol
[1:15:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember back when DK was very tough, people spazzed out over it
[1:15:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was watching one of the dev interviews about hero talents in War Within, and the one sounded like he actually played DK, so that is looking good
[1:15:36] Nosphe456: how is frost DK right now?
[1:16:55] tooch2: is zone still super neutered?
[1:17:55] Nosphe456: the frost?

[1:18:24] omkar3108: PogChamp
[1:20:03] tooch2: How are Shamans looking? I feel like we were always forgotten about
[1:21:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't seen many enhancements lately
[1:22:20] tooch2: ele/enh mostly were my go tos
[1:22:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: With warrior going down in value, could be harder for them to run turbo
[1:23:31] anmusallam: while i hate playing against warriors, i feel so bad. They got screwed hard, I dont even think blizz considered the armor strength talent they had.

[1:25:19] dawsonator171: if you had to estimate a time for raid, what do you think it would be? trying to see if I'll be awake for it.
[1:25:31] Gwynbleidd710: @notmes What's the benefit of running 2x BoJ and 1x Judgement? Wouldn't 2x Judgement proc 2set and therefore 4set on the same expurgation?
[1:25:47] anmusallam: we are paper plate
[1:26:07] Gwynbleidd710: Ah, fair enough
[1:26:53] anmusallam: it might be another 3-6 weeks until we see a change
[1:26:56] sunileif: has redeemed Warriors are fine! 69

[1:30:27] kh9911: @notmes  what u think about reti buff will jump meta?
[1:30:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hammer that vulpera! LUL
[1:33:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kind of a pick your poison, it looked like
[1:33:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that is a big swing in damage
[1:35:48] fearsii: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:37:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tough fight, good win there
[1:37:08] tooch2: after two decades of dominance, mages should never been allowed a buff again LUL
[1:38:59] anmusallam: idk how youre supposed to catch an arcane mage as a melee  lmao
[1:39:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: That little vulpera is out for blood
[1:40:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa chaos bolts
[1:40:59] misterblaht: Kappa Kappa
[1:42:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brutal! Awesome
[1:43:02] mcbleek: is ret about to be meta
[1:44:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was remembering awhile back when ret-war was terrorizing the ladder, it technically wasn't meta and it didn't work in AWC
[1:44:49] nikthevoker: sup @notmes hows it going man
[1:44:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just day to day, ret was so strong but it just didn't seem to be the absolute best way to win
[1:46:29] dubbfiend: does blizz often add to the tunings on Monday as you suggested? havenâ€™t seen that in a bit

[1:47:06] dubbfiend: ah makes sense, ty
[1:47:13] dawsonator171: mes, do you think you could make me a blood build for r1 shuffle purposes?
[1:48:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: The blood build options are pretty narrow for PvE
[1:48:06] swinkylol: swinkylol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! .

[2:34:05] Begasaur: the hotel association in NYC fought to make mininum stay in NYC 30 days. so you have to jump thru alot of loopholes to get an illegal sublet for less than that. which in turn brought the hotel prices down "slightly" but you can find a decent spot in the outer boroughs for cheap
[2:34:34] saiyan333: We always use Airbnb so because a lot of them let you bring pets. Just so much easier taking trips being able to bring the dogs with.

[5:13:22] eMBeaR64oz: palworld also free on game pass for xbox/pc too XD
[5:14:10] eMBeaR64oz: yea
[5:14:29] Hikamiro: it is part of game pass but i heard the xbox version is a bit worse right now
[5:14:32] jazrian: it was day-one on gamepass
[5:14:33] Hikamiro: they're waiting on a patch
[5:14:43] eMBeaR64oz: game pass does quite a bit of early access ("game preview") and day one release stuff
[5:15:04] Sempora: Also Gamepass and Steam aren't cross compatible
[5:15:12] TheEyeVII: nintendo will sue for sure, idk how they don't after the AI leaks etc
[5:17:01] capizzi45: hi. DK blind will take 100% more damage before canceling after patch?
[5:17:05] Legosauruswrecks: This man has 655g. anyone gonna fix that>
[5:17:59] Legosauruswrecks: @notmes you barely have enough golf to repair. can anyone fix that???? im broke or i would. Gold wise!!
[5:18:59] Legosauruswrecks: Someone fill this man's bank so we can watch more games
[5:19:16] Sempora: If they were going to sue surely it would happen before it launches
[5:19:48] avenueone: judgement day starts because of palworld
[5:21:53] eMBeaR64oz: i wonder if its gonna be problematic if they used the word "pokemon" in the ai prompt
[5:21:53] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:22:27] eMBeaR64oz: i wonder if it will be something that changes in the future tho
[5:23:30] Sempora: It gets very grey, people have been sued for using certain melodies etc in songs
[5:24:12] Sempora: Yeah I'm just thinking that some of these Pals look very similar to some of the Pokemon
[5:25:21] Sempora: Will be very interesting to see what happens. Bit frustrating that this shows what we could have had if Nintendo just made this first with actual Pokemon
[5:25:46] vyraxxvenomblade: Hi Mes, how you doing man?  How weather there? How your family doing in the new year?
[5:25:59] eMBeaR64oz: I think this style of game just without the guns and gore would be prime for pokemon
[5:26:06] Sempora: Yeah true. It wouldn't be the same as they wouldn't have the guns etc
[5:26:13] eMBeaR64oz: but I feel like pokemon games havnt innovated in a LOOONG time
[5:26:19] eMBeaR64oz: they just kinda rode their wave and sat back
[5:26:55] TheEyeVII: last time they did something new with pokemon it was pokemon go
[5:27:15] Sempora: They went into COD/Madden/FIFA territory - same basic principle just slightly changed each time
[5:28:01] TheEyeVII: even worse, so they never did anything new
[5:28:15] sharpdressedman15: digimon was a straight ripoff of pokemon
[5:28:39] TheEyeVII: at least it was authorized by them, whoever made it
[5:28:55] Anubatras: Hey Mes, what do you think about the Armor Adjustments they gonna do? I feel like Hunter and Monk Dmg is allready pretty scary when i play DK....
[5:29:10] dawsonator171: I watch one of the most advanced AIs ever every night.
[5:29:14] sharpdressedman15: appreciate the legal advice
[5:30:34] Sempora: Nintendo own the rights IIRC, I think Gamefreak just develop for them?
[5:32:17] dawsonator171: With what is on the internet, AI will master Sex and then start a Robot Brothel.
[5:32:59] Sempora: Scraping data from public websites is another grey area IMO. If I train my bot on the BBC News channel or something can they sue me?
[5:33:03] injos: I don't understand why ppl are upset when computers use public available material to learn. But it's the way every human learns almost everything. Want to learn to paint? Look at other paintings -> try to copy. Make it enough times. Just like AI does it.
[5:33:07] Sempora: or is that "fair use"?
[5:33:50] TheEyeVII: @Sempora sure, if they can prove similar patterns
[5:35:37] injos: But if you don't want your data to be used for AI. Then publish it where everyone can see it. If you want it to be used, do not publish it.
[5:35:59] injos: Ok, I flipped the point. fml ^^
[5:36:29] dawsonator171: who technically owns your streams? and will the DK robots rise?
[5:36:53] avenueone: who owns you dawsonator
[5:37:21] TheEyeVII: @injos it's not all public domain
[5:37:43] dawsonator171: Either my wife or my employer, I'm not sure ave.
[5:38:26] injos: @TheEyeVII  If it's awailable online it's public. You might not like it, and you might want ppl to pay for it, or not AI use it. But you put it out there.
[5:39:32] TheEyeVII: you can copy strike a youtube vid for stealing your content, so ya you still own the rights to some & no something being on the internet isn't public by default
[5:39:47] TheEyeVII: not legally at least
[5:40:35] injos: Yes you can. But that's if your stealing it as your own. AI is using that data to learn from it.
[5:41:30] injos: If I try to copy the mona lisa and sell it on craigslist. They can't really claim copyright and force me to not sell it. I feel the same logic should apply to AI learing from public available data.
[5:42:08] injos: I do however understand that a lot of companies would like regulation to force AIs to pay for the learning data.
[5:42:08] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:42:33] injos: Just like any company getting obsolete by new tech tries to withstand the new changes.
[5:43:16] TheEyeVII: depends if someone owns it, depends if you hinder their profits, then they might sue your ass for IP theft as an example
[5:44:37] TheEyeVII: my guess is vast majority of people will get away with most copypastings online, it'd only be if you have major exposure that you might then get sued by someone somewhere TwitchConHYPE
[5:46:46] Pa1ach7: What do you guys thinks about new changes. Bad news for DK :/
[5:47:13] injos: Yes. Money talks behind all business. And that's probably how AI will play out (they will have to pay for learning data). But it's wierd since we than have 1 set of laws for humans and another set of laws for how "AIs" can learn things.
[5:53:40] dawsonator171: I'd do a few bosses before bed.
[5:54:49] Szain3: DinoDance

[5:57:07] omkar3108: PogChamp
[5:57:08] injos: I thind it interesting that neither nintendo, sony or ms have tried to make legal action against emulation. From my understanding they're afraid they might loose and set a precedent. So we still don't know if emulation is illegal or not =)
[6:00:21] zachgamegodx: mes.  why donâ€™t you just do heroic fyrak skips
[6:01:01] zachgamegodx: the whole raid for all your dks and warrs seems like a lot
[6:02:27] injos: Could be a huge loss if it where to become legal. But yes, I don't think they loose a lot of money the way it is now. Mostly just enthusiast using emulation.
[6:02:27] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[6:02:29] avenueone: room for a 434 mw?

[9:00:45] paladinsareepic: @notmes, can u short explain how i have to play elemental? (in terms of positioning)
[9:01:15] Mazerrise: Meatballs go brr

[9:03:39] professor02: fascinating control
[9:05:59] stockbridge10: die hunter
[9:06:48] serratedlove: what do you track with the stopwatch on bottom right?
[9:06:49] nikthevoker: sorry had to afk sec, perfect btw ya api was just over it
[9:07:00] nikthevoker: trying to get opener down
[9:07:58] professor02: Do you actually control all the pets abilities manually?, stun i get obv :O
[9:08:42] thunderstud25: btw i haven't done much arena since u me and mike did 3s many weeks ago, otherwise just capping vault in arena
[9:08:44] thunderstud25: so rust is real
[9:09:34] darkwingdad__: I want to see blizzard remove addons and macros / scripts from game, force people to stop using them and most people wont make it past 1200 let alone rank 1 , and pve'rs wouldn't finish content so fast
[9:10:31] darkwingdad__: i stopped playing this game its bad, addons macros and scripts are considered cheating they play the game for you
[9:11:35] Yoskexz: do u have a armor ranking Pog
[9:11:50] thunderstud25: he literally left before i could get that KB lol
[9:12:16] Yoskexz: its got to be dragon but idk
[9:12:37] professor02: 8 what?
[9:12:37] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[9:13:27] professor02: crazy that plate has the least hehe
[9:14:16] kitsoupne: warlock having 8.3k is crazy
[9:15:58] Blaze150000: but it doesnt rly matter if warlock has so much armor for uh dk right ? we do anyway lot magic dmg
[9:16:10] Yankee_ZuIu: its a DK buff or nerf ?
[9:16:35] Blaze150000: dk in pve buff in pvp nerf
[9:16:55] Yankee_ZuIu: classic blizzard ðŸ¤£
[9:18:59] Blaze150000: yes yes for the whole game.
[9:19:00] professor02: dk is getting nerfed?
[9:19:03] thunderstud25: i think the double dip locks get on stam and armor is just annoying
[9:20:05] Blaze150000: i would only buff armor of cloth but not nerf the plate armor. we will get paper for warrs
[9:20:40] professor02: DK do alot non melee dmg no?
[9:20:45] waitimdesyncd: hello everyone I hope you all have a good day
[9:20:47] Brunduru: @Blaze150000 You know how big of a nerf that would be for hunters
[9:20:55] kitsoupne: do you think leather needs buffed as well?
[9:21:07] doomcute: platers gonna have same armor as mail lol
[9:21:15] doomcute: thats a class fantasy
[9:21:24] Mazerrise: Which is redic..
[9:22:31] professor02: so warr would suffer the most from the armor increase?
[9:22:50] thunderstud25: armor nerf for warrior is also damage nerf lol
[9:22:56] Blaze150000: i have when i hit the pvp dummy 11 427 armor = 30.78% phys dmg reduced. so -30% we will have around 20% phys dmg reduction?
[9:23:13] xDShiro: Do warriors lose 500str from the armor->str talent?
[9:23:14] Yoskexz: such a massive arcane mage patch, more hp for ring of fire, root threshold, armor buff
[9:23:37] waitimdesyncd: @Blaze150000  lontar said u cant test it on dummy since it changes in duels  and arena for some reason, but I dont have the data. I just  heard him talk about that for 10 min
[9:24:33] Blaze150000: when u hit the pvp dummy u see your stats like u were in pvp combat.
[9:25:10] Blaze150000: without hitting pvp dummy i have only 9984 armor
[9:25:13] nikthevoker: my new fav classic WA click and change rune display
[9:25:18] waitimdesyncd: @Blaze150000  yeah I know but dummies are bugged in many ways. Festering wound for DK doesnt scale correctly on it, so DONT  test it on dummy
[9:25:41] Blaze150000: im not testing dmg on dummy
[9:26:07] waitimdesyncd: Lontar says armor isnt correct on dummy do with that what you want, Im trying to help you @Blaze150000
[9:26:53] waitimdesyncd: also your 30% dam reduc doesnt mean you remove 10% of that because of DRs etc.
[9:27:44] Szain3: DinoDance
[9:28:44] Blaze150000: but lets see how it will be, we also get a bigger lifepool
[9:29:28] waitimdesyncd: buff dhs they are not oppressive enough
[9:29:53] thunderstud25: don't worry next week my consecration will do more damage

[9:38:05] waitimdesyncd: @nikthevoker  are you "excite" for devoker tomorrow, as borat would say
[9:39:19] nikthevoker: was there changes posted i ddnt see?
[9:39:55] waitimdesyncd: dev being high dam and people only have 10% more hp doesnt change much for dev I feel. Having more hp as Dev will be nice tho
[9:40:52] waitimdesyncd: dev could easily have had some nerfs this week IMO, but they are gucci
[9:41:23] professor02: hp sux over def stats ^^
[9:41:39] nikthevoker: ya ok i logged early yesterday jus making sure LUL
[9:41:52] nikthevoker: ya sometimes youre so close to living
[9:43:07] waitimdesyncd: Dev not getting any changes besides more HP that scales a tiny bit with the 2 walls, and the 8% stam talent and defensive talents + leech
[9:43:25] nikthevoker: so were basicallly getting like 100k hp?
[9:43:28] waitimdesyncd: so overall a buff I'd say. People having 10% more hp is not saving them from Dev dam
[9:43:46] waitimdesyncd: Yeah, enough to live 1-2 sec more than usual
[9:44:21] professor02: Could you talk through your plays one game? if you don't mind, got so much to learn in playing dk
[9:44:48] waitimdesyncd: im a brainlet, but Im happy about dev LUL it has been free rating for me playing dev this expac
[9:44:50] nikthevoker: @notmes didnt know if youre WA was clickable to change but i just wanted to share while i remember its new LUL

[10:04:16] gumbot27: hey mes can you help with my targeting keybinds, rn im just tabbing and using focus keybinds
[10:04:52] nikthevoker: LUL mes if you have peacock you got to watch an episode of ted, just not kid friendly
[10:05:01] waitimdesyncd: Dh vs Hpal :(

[10:08:17] thunderstud25: but i didn't think i could die there
[10:08:37] nikthevoker: it makes me realize how fucked up my childhood was
[10:11:31] nikthevoker: do you always play clawing in 2s?

[10:13:13] Time_Limits: bigger dam from rogue
[10:13:20] thunderstud25: but maybe that is just hindsight
[10:13:32] thunderstud25: gonna need r-q
[10:13:37] Blaze150000: did u see venrukis yt video why pvp rewards are still too hard to get?
[10:13:47] Time_Limits: oh yeah true..
[10:15:59] reedthesham: wonder if that takes out alts
[10:16:11] reedthesham: Like Bigdam for enhance has like 15 shamans up ther
[10:16:52] thunderstud25: i usually get 2100 and quit

[10:17:15] waitimdesyncd: LUL
[10:17:16] reedthesham: toxic
[10:17:19] reedthesham: lol
[10:18:43] waitimdesyncd: Just read on that forum that wars lose close to 500 Str on reset. That sucks for them
[10:20:38] thunderstud25: with the stam changes and all i wonder how fury will prob feel
[10:24:40] waitimdesyncd: War losing 500 str is considerable since they do less dam to clothies
[10:30:03] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd but they also win the plate armor changes since they will do more dmg to other plates, and other plates will do less in comparison since they do magic dmg
[10:30:44] Blaze150000: WB
[10:30:55] oldmatevis: did you play with ace bloke? at somepoint mes
[10:31:06] waitimdesyncd: @honsou2  Yeah they do more dam to plate, BUT they also lose 500 str AND they lose 500str and DO LESS dam to clothies. So its not like they outright "win" anything
[10:31:10] oldmatevis: yea
[10:31:18] oldmatevis: long time ago
[10:32:03] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd maybe warrior wont autowin 2s then
[10:32:40] reedthesham: no wonder people don't like to heal, just went 6 rounds in a shuffle without one single kick from melee cleaves
[10:32:52] reedthesham: hpal walks across the maps and hardcasts rep's right by them
[10:33:07] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[10:33:38] honsou2: @reedthesham sounds like that would make it more enjoyable for the healers
[10:34:25] reedthesham: when an hpal ist standing next to a warrior/dk/ww hard casting and not juking. kicking is easy
[10:34:29] reedthesham: there were no stuns either
[10:34:33] reedthesham: so its not enjoyable :(
[10:36:27] Moobot: Please be sure to ask permission before posting links in chat! (@waitimdesyncd)
[10:37:16] waitimdesyncd: Check out around the conclusion
[10:37:45] Blaze150000: mmr match making value / cr current live rating
[10:38:49] honsou2: cant believe they didnt have a 2.4 2h sword mog until it became impossible to get for plebs like me LUL
[10:39:02] waitimdesyncd: Ive never read that reddit forum before, but there is LOADS of misinformation on it. But that post looked interesting
[10:39:06] tony1992qt: merge na eu
[10:39:09] tony1992qt: :P
[10:40:39] honsou2: But you wont ever see the same level of 3s participation so why shouldnt the ladder be redesigned
[10:41:01] waitimdesyncd: @honsou2  100% in favor of some redesigning
[10:41:07] honsou2: idk i feel like a lot of us have asked for a percentage system for a long time
[10:41:21] tony1992qt: they more active then they used to be
[10:42:29] figurines: The bracket suffers because they balanced around the high end forever. so most of the players that arne't at the high end don't play the fully balanced game EVERY season
[10:43:16] honsou2: if ladder tiers are set percentages then why isnt that better for lower activity? i didnt understand the expalantion
[10:43:17] waitimdesyncd: If they make it so a higher % of players get glad i think they should also make a new reward for top top top players so I still have someone to look up to and  admire when they stand afk at mailboxes with their new title/mog/mount/toy/whatever
[10:43:52] figurines: as a perma casual who never gets glad or even tries the actual pressing of buttons is less fun and more difficult than it used to be. my friends have all quit with the same comments
[10:44:08] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd they have that its a rank 1 title
[10:44:41] mikgullll: do you think we will ever Get ret like it was before legion again?
[10:45:22] waitimdesyncd: @honsou2  I still feel like there should be something for the top top top players that dont sit for R1. I know R1 titles exist, but having a reward for 2400 and then next rewardis 2800-3000 seems scuffed idk
[10:46:05] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd thats such a small part of the playerbase
[10:46:50] waitimdesyncd: @honsou2  It would be a goal for anyone getting glad, and when you get glad youre "done", theres no rewards after that. Its not about rewarding a small % of the players, but giving ALL the glads something to keep playing their main for
[10:46:56] parsimonious157: do you play with sound effects on, or is it just your WA package?
[10:47:45] thunderstud25: the amount of 1600 cr 3s looking for 2.4k xp is pretty funny
[10:48:33] waitimdesyncd: @thunderstud25  the amount of BFA S4 glads and SL(was it S3?) on their glad mounts at 1600cr is pretty damn funny indeed
[10:49:29] brazkat: i agree with what you said yesterday about rating rotting away at the higher end
[10:49:53] waitimdesyncd: I got r1 on my server in 2s currently, does that mean im 7x better than r1 in 3s? Kappa  Kappa
[10:51:13] waitimdesyncd: if so then I like that post. Me and Original-poster should queue some 2s together, seems he is as obsessed with 2s as I am Kappa
[10:51:36] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd no it means the other way around
[10:52:34] waitimdesyncd: "Reaching 2.4 in EU 2s is roughly 7x harder than in 3s and 9x harder than in shuffle." The post says in 7x better than 3s r1's Kappa @honsou2
[10:52:39] Itankarenas: are there new tuning changes or something?
[10:52:59] waitimdesyncd: im*
[10:53:35] thunderstud25: if we ignore the 2Ls, one from UI error and the other from Mes ghosting a queue we are doing pretty well :p

[10:57:29] Szain3: DinoDance
[10:59:15] yourKnightmaare: just realized you're playing clawing
[10:59:51] stockbridge10: gl
[11:01:59] lostspecies58: @notmes are you better then PetKick?
[11:01:59] yourKnightmaare: how come?
[11:02:19] yourKnightmaare: I like the clawing playstyle more than dot. but yeah
[11:02:26] yourKnightmaare: dot is insane dmg
[11:02:59] yourKnightmaare: how do you feel about bursting with plaguebringer?
[11:04:25] yourKnightmaare: that rot pressure is what is so appealing about the build. I just like the clawing build feel more. feels good to press
[11:04:44] waitimdesyncd: more damooge
[11:05:15] waitimdesyncd: clawing feels more impactful when I play a lower rating and I get to be in full control of the damage, burst and when it happens. For me
[11:06:13] yourKnightmaare: I just don't know how to optimize and prioritize using ss sometimes I feel like I'm just wasting it
[11:06:29] nikthevoker: wwhat build do you use in shuffle the most
[11:07:24] Blaze150000: but also in low mmr games lot of healers cant handle the rot dmg on 3 targets
[11:07:26] waitimdesyncd: The R1 DK in EU at 2900 in 3s is using leech talent too now
[11:08:06] waitimdesyncd: @Blaze150000  At low MMR people die too fast because they dont press their abilities right to begin with. You can easily win with clawing in the opener at low MMR
[11:08:25] waitimdesyncd: but both are good, rot is just better overall with good players
[11:08:44] waitimdesyncd: Ye just checked
[11:09:04] waitimdesyncd: BwPA/gf1fDREKLfAcG9Z2HkF/BAiEBiUiEJJJSECSikkAAAAAAAAAgCJRSikkGAAhUSkkkgE is his, though its basically exactly what U have now on talents
[11:09:20] nikthevoker: do use clawing mostly in shuffle?
[11:09:46] nikthevoker: also alot were using ERW
[11:09:54] Dudewuut: mes do you feel a lack of doomburst procs without rune weapon or the melee speed increase talents on that line
[11:10:07] Blaze150000: attun is like 6 ppm
[11:10:12] Dudewuut: err sudden doom but yeah
[11:12:16] ONSRorix: is the enchantment leech % hp based? maybe it's time to swap to leech frrom speed
[11:12:54] waitimdesyncd: down goes the zookeeper

[11:13:37] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[11:13:56] nerdyorc_: do you think warriors are just giga nerfed tomorow?
[11:14:00] thunderstud25: belief
[11:14:17] xiliketurtlex: since we are getting conq uncapped what do you think about another weapon with stoneskin garg enchant vs pure melee in solo etc?
[11:14:37] Dudewuut: I feel if you have uptime and are overcapping on runic power, do you really need it? probably not
[11:15:01] yourKnightmaare: I feel like attenu isn't that beneficial
[11:15:31] Dudewuut: if you are trying to maintain dota witg ff rp gen and with runic atten if you are overcapping, then probs dont need it ya?

[11:44:15] nemeuxs: yikes

[11:44:49] Vendrek: Hunter one shots on plate
[11:44:59] swolecolemole: all of the armor changes seem straight delulu
[11:45:08] yoogyrdru: the question is how did dhs dodge the nerfs but dk is getting big nerf xD
[11:47:19] thunderstud25: cant wait to take more damage to that next week
[11:48:04] afellowtraveler: Ya DH looks nuts

[11:48:17] yoogyrdru: i would like too see
[11:48:39] nemeuxs: warrior is going to be hot dog shit
[11:48:40] Tiebot87: @notmes they should make DW frost DKs relavent again u think.
[11:48:44] Vendrek: @Ktunec5 I might become meta tomorrow
[11:50:15] yourKnightmaare: frost should get reworked
[11:50:41] stockbridge10: hf
[11:50:44] josephzein: do u use the same dk talents for 3s?
[11:51:22] xiliketurtlex: petkick think the same way. he believes its actually buff to dk
[11:51:22] thunderstud25: thanks for the games, was super fun and brush off the arena rust lol
[11:52:57] honsou2: @xiliketurtlex petkick just heard mes opinion lol
[11:53:13] josephzein: @xiliketurtlex what is exactly?
[11:54:06] xiliketurtlex: that armor nerf doesnt really matter since we are getting more stamina
[11:54:07] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[11:54:11] xiliketurtlex: its actually buff to dks
[11:54:35] Solushun: i just ran into crazywoodowl <3
[11:54:35] sake_xo: is sarena fixed? my addon hasn't been working
[11:55:02] honsou2: @josephzein The Mes Hypothesis is that the 10% hp increase will slow the meta down and make it about mana barring healers. DK defensives scale with hp so dk will be good in manabar games. Now if the 10% hp increase actually does that or if its not even noticeable we will see tomorrow
[11:56:03] jayyArrington: mes wha ya take on WW?
[11:56:53] jayyArrington: not changes just in general?
[11:56:54] xiliketurtlex: pretty sure during SL season 1 or 2, dks were struggling pretty hard and they buffed veteran of the third war and we were good to go
[11:57:35] honsou2: "good to go" DK was terrible in SL
[11:57:57] honsou2: well the class design cant speak for the effectiveness rly

[11:58:44] omgcowz: Surely they fix the arms armor talent right?
[11:58:59] thunderstud25: whats it like having such a variety of talents that you can play? :D
[11:59:12] honsou2: nerfing apoc tho but yeah the talent is buffed
[11:59:19] honsou2: might be good to make apoc still do dmg
[11:59:20] Dudewuut: and losing bargain for bloodforged doesn't feel as bad
[11:59:40] wowsuomi: Blood in the market place
[12:00:08] Dudewuut: but mes the wound nerf and hp increase from crypt fever should even out though right so a net neutral?
