[0:00:36] influx_404_: Eyyy
[0:00:40] Saevash: eyoo
[0:00:45] JimothyOnline: Good afternoon <3
[0:00:53] MeggoArt: NotLikeThis
[0:01:01] Sindorein1124: Greetings
[0:01:10] aurum2509: heyyyy
[0:01:24] Nulgar: Eyyyy, Feierabend, Wochenende and a T&E stream
[0:02:42] HSAyril: So much to do so much to see, together. Ayyyy
[0:03:19] influx_404_: SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc Zug Zug
[0:03:20] winter092875: Happy Friday stream
[0:03:29] Shokadezz: Wooo
[0:04:50] ChristaStarr: Oh dear, an angry stream
[0:05:10] Sorin__: no wonder after yesterday
[0:05:23] ChristaStarr: fr
[0:05:50] Nulgar: Corgo100 so much to do so much to see, wh-heyyyy (at least at this point in the stream, Tali doesn't talk over it :p )
[0:06:24] Nulgar: :|
[0:06:47] Nulgar: That letter is not "double U", it's "W"
[0:07:23] HSAyril: It looks like a double v, not a double u
[0:07:27] aurum2509: @sorin__ what happened yesterday?
[0:07:50] MeggoArt: @aurum2509 oh boy
[0:07:57] MeggoArt: you must not be on twitter
[0:08:02] Sorin__: 1900 people being laid off at activision blizzard
[0:08:03] HSAyril: Probably the lay offs
[0:08:12] Sorin__: 1900 people man what a ridiculous number
[0:08:33] HSAyril: I wonder how much of those positions were redundant stuff like payroll and HR
[0:09:03] aurum2509: oh how many people?
[0:09:04] Efforex: The entire staff for the survival game are gone.
[0:09:27] McScooterson: modcheck
[0:09:35] AlfredK: Any mods?
[0:09:37] HSAyril: Gone or some gone and some reassigned? I haven't seen anything one way or the other about the staff of game being gone
[0:09:54] Fibnkak: @Efforex so
[0:11:12] Efforex: The survival game was canceled and the staff were laid off. I imagine, like others have said, that some redundant positions were also let go now that Microsoft has completed it's acquisition.
[0:11:22] Nulgar: @hsayril there's having a reason to cut redundant positions, and then there's not warning your employees so they have to hear it from third-party sources (without knowing yet whether they themselves are affected)
[0:11:44] Fibnkak: people are fired so often when they rely on stockholders that only want profits from successful games not created games.
[0:11:57] gloggins: Sounds like they also cut down the diablo and overwatch crews a lot so they can reattribute people to wow.
[0:12:03] Reminii91: wow evening chat. Chatter already starting :D :D :D
[0:13:12] Voidheim: every company purchase in the history of humankind has lead to layoffs afterwards.
[0:13:15] Voidheim: it sucks
[0:13:23] HSAyril: It doesn't sound like there's a win in either way. I read an insightful post from Ghostcrawler about why (not that he was defending it) announcements like that happen before the employees know
[0:14:57] HSAyril: I can objectively see the perspective. You either tell the employees first and they all run to every social media site they can and the company loses control of the reason why lay offs are happening, or you publicly announce it first and the employees get scared not knowing if they're being let go
[0:15:09] katplaysthings: katplaysthings subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months, currently on a 58 month streak! just had knee surgery and I guess I got nothing better to do than watch this suboptimal stream lololol.

[0:19:58] duat_auru: duat_auru subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:20:02] Goblinounours: Sounds a bit like Mike Ybarra either was forced out by MS, or he because he was unhappy with MS.
[0:20:11] MeggoArt: JAB
[0:20:13] MeggoArt: brack
[0:20:16] madmerco: J allen brack
[0:20:20] ArcaneSyntax: Ybarra was looks ng for hyper growth in his DPS numbers.
[0:20:26] terve_kumpania: Yeah, it does sound like he was forced out to me
[0:20:33] Reminii91: oh J, he's iconic with that line isn't he?
[0:20:34] Zervanite: Was he the co-leader that was paid more than the female counter part position and didn't say anything?
[0:20:36] FatCatDad48: When he teared up a bit during his blizzcon speech I thought "Maybe he's not that bad." I was wrong.
[0:20:37] Fibnkak: was a bitch
[0:20:44] ellindaplays: "The you think you do but you don't guy" has got to be one of the worst non-scummy-ceo type legacies to have in gaming
[0:20:48] itsClubby: love a cheeky bit of imagery
[0:20:59] ButterStains: think we will hear any news about danuser in wake of the layoff news?
[0:21:07] Reminii91: way the show off with the Auction mount :D
[0:21:08] MeggoArt: if you're gonna talk about ybarra you gotta mention jen oneal at least
[0:21:09] Vunderbrat: Vunderbrat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:21:13] frankenfoot5: I don't do a good job of following WoW drama. Did people like or dislike Ybarra? I thought he was just another C-suit jag off
[0:21:17] Goblinounours: To me, it always was obvious that he was brought in to be a controllable pawn to Activision.
[0:21:19] jiveyivey: Mike "They'll have to pry me from the office grounds" Ybarra
[0:21:23] hulksballs: Good afternoon, everyone!
[0:21:32] hulksballs: Ahhh, I knew this'll be the angy-stream. I'm here for it!
[0:21:34] madmerco: You were like legit news people reporting a breaking situation.
[0:21:51] HSAyril: It's odd seeing a lot of people who like Ybara turn on him like he betrayed them without knowing why he left
[0:21:57] frankenfoot5: C Suite* oops. Need to finish my coffee before I highlight my typos on the internet
[0:22:30] ArcaneSyntax: What happened to Danuser?
[0:22:42] Vataraa: I feel sorry for them
[0:23:11] Ryall_: yay console exclusives
[0:23:20] Didamus: I didn't know Danuser was gone
[0:23:32] Tegger37: there are never mergers.  Someone always acquires someone.  The side being bought will have layoffs.
[0:23:39] MeggoArt: i have so many thoughts about the CS situation and i'm so very very disappointed in the community for not giving CS workers the empathy they deserve in this situation -- plus it's gonna make the game worse. full stop.
[0:23:39] Goblinounours: Saw a thumbnail of an Akkolon video with a drawn diagram with all of Blizzard's games, not sure what he was saying. ^^
[0:23:43] hulksballs: So many layoffs in the world right now, so sad. I lost my film career of 6 years due to the actors / writers strike (but I support the strikes, so) so I feel for them
[0:23:49] denflup: OW dead
[0:24:02] the_howlermonkey: did they annouince the screwing of Danuser yet?
[0:24:29] atamala: is microsoft the true tneWowkiller
[0:24:45] Tegger37: Really wondering about future Blizzcons.
[0:24:47] funviking99: I am sorry for all those ppl that lost their job but tbh they haven’t done a good job lately except wow, maybe now the devs would do better
[0:24:51] funviking99: the new ones
[0:24:59] artisanhughes: @taliesinandevitel i work in the. Same building as blizz Cork. Haven't heard anything from my immediate friends
[0:25:01] databob1: Microsoft us figuratively killing the Golden goose if you know the reference
[0:25:03] cabeshpash: yeah worker rights here are terrible :/
[0:25:07] RAF_Sean: @funviking99 You for reawl?
[0:25:10] conul: @funviking99 how the fk is it th dev's fault, it's the DIRECTION loser
[0:25:12] aeson_of_raid_sock: yay freedom
[0:25:19] MuzzaiaH: @funviking99 what a fucking disgusting take
[0:25:32] rowankekw: i have to say that even during layoffs the german blizzard customer support has only increased in quality and has gotten faster and its most definitely by employing local people with actual work rights
[0:25:32] restokin: @funviking99 shameful
[0:25:36] wuubzee: Mike Ybarra cried on stage at Blizzcon and was hugging it out with Phil Spencer, probably both knowing this was coming ... at the time I thought it was cute, now idk. Hyper-growth corpo freaks
[0:25:44] Nulgar: I mean, I get the objective reasons, but how can a large company such as Microsoft be so dumb to not prepare employees, offer them support or incentives for leaving voluntarily, do the minimum effort to look like they're doing this because they have to. Easy. Publicity. Slam. Dunk.
[0:25:52] Reminii91: That's an OOF
[0:25:55] Sorin__: that's grotesque
[0:26:05] Tegger37: In my career (I'm retired now) I've been through multiple layoffs.  Always leaves a scar.  Like all scars, they heal though over time.  Mgmt counts on it.
[0:26:07] atamala: @Nulgar not enough shareholder value
[0:26:08] databob1: Or the goose that keyed the golden eggs more precisely
[0:26:17] ShadowDragon14855: morning all
[0:26:27] Vunderbrat: Choo Chooo Kappa
[0:26:32] databob1: Layed
[0:26:35] ButterStains: I feel like this conversation really goes hand in hand with the recent convos about AI art and just devaluing the creatives who make these games so great, as well as all the support positions.
[0:26:43] RAF_Sean: People always do their best work on a game when they are constantly afraid they'll lose their jobs. /s
[0:26:51] Oswaldovzki: They are looking back and realizing they need to change to another direction and the one laidoff are not in their new vision
[0:26:59] Sorin__: cos line go up
[0:27:02] atamala: Corpa number go up
[0:27:06] hulksballs: Really sucks, right at the start of the year too
[0:27:13] Tegger37: This will eventually become old news.  Always happens.
[0:27:21] funviking99: this is how corporations work sadly
[0:27:24] MrScotticus: Short term gains for long term losses
[0:27:24] Mulajin: cheaper to outsource QA than pay your own staff kekw
[0:27:28] atamala: quiet quitting :)
[0:27:28] HSAyril: The company is going to care about controlling the news narrative more than the employees, and whatever rumor or lie employees run to every social media channel is going to stick first, even if MS comes out with a thorough statement later. I'm not defending them, justbsaying from the company perspective that's more important to them
[0:27:32] Oswaldovzki: it does not
[0:27:33] Tegger37: Yay Capitalism!
[0:27:34] Ryall_: american corpo toxicity
[0:27:36] itsClubby: karagiNod
[0:27:37] restokin: You're just a peon. Everyone is replaceable
[0:27:38] wuubzee: Fear of being fired OR being replaced with AI... sounds inspiring
[0:27:46] gloggins: Employee owned is the way to go.
[0:27:50] terve_kumpania: Ghostcrawler said it best yesterday
[0:28:00] atamala: golden parachute
[0:28:03] itsClubby: But wait Tali he is going on holiday
[0:28:14] conul: mike ybarra was bad and he has a golden parachute, dont care about him rly
[0:28:18] HSAyril: Ghostcrawler gave a very insightful post about it yesterday
[0:28:19] restokin: Also remember: HR is not your friend, HR is there to protect the company from its employees
[0:28:25] JimothyOnline: Corporate rats care about nothing outside of their own wallets
[0:28:29] databob1: Shareholders are the worst business men on the planet they have no forethought
[0:28:42] MeggoArt: jen oneal
[0:28:45] Tibainium: Jen O'neil?
[0:28:49] funviking99: Jen
[0:28:58] lunakinthedruid: bad news for real people. If 10.2.6 launches on Tuesday, no one will even care if its good. Generally a short attention span for most people sadly
[0:28:58] Atomicpanda: ms paid less for the same job
[0:29:16] MeggoArt: i will die mad about what they did to jen oneal
[0:29:50] wuubzee: Him playing wow at work while she does all the work... sounded like a nice gig
[0:29:56] atamala: was it even a month lol
[0:30:13] Its_an_implication: Because she wasn't getting equal pay right?
[0:30:25] Nulgar: Honestly, it should be just illegal to sack people, especially when the reason is that you DELIBERATELY merged two companies and how have too many employees. Your fucking decision, you deal with it, but not on the backs of your employees.
[0:30:28] Vaephera: The statements are always nonsense PR stuff when it comes to C-level stuff
[0:30:29] Tibainium: She had a much smaller salary than Mike Ybarra
[0:30:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin waiting for the palworld stream so we can watch enslaved in action
[0:30:47] influx_404_: Typical Bobby moment
[0:30:50] cabeshpash: fuck bobby Kotick
[0:30:51] skeletonetiquette: Well deserved angry stream
[0:31:08] Goblinounours: Which is why Ybarra's statement as he leaves also smells like bullshit.
[0:31:17] conul: oh no the millionaire is not paid well enough?
[0:31:27] lord_konstantine: Its so obviously dumb to pay her less I must think there was more to the story. Maybe more other benefits or smth.
[0:31:29] ellindaplays: Jen being paid less was the most fucked up hilarious "ofcourse they did that" shit that happened during that shit storm era of blizz
[0:32:16] databob1: @taliesinandevitel  yeah tokenism is definitely the right word they didn't respect her at all
[0:32:19] cabeshpash: "choose"
[0:32:30] atamala: they messed up a token
[0:32:33] Goblinounours: I wouldn't be blaming Ybarra for being the fall-guy and the face to hate for most of the bad decisions at Blizzard. I think from the start, he was picked to be a pawn Bobby could control.
[0:32:39] polygoncoke: Mike Ybarra had only been at blizzard for 18 months?
[0:32:41] MeggoArt: i hope jen is having a good day somewhere
[0:32:48] funviking99: losing his job?
[0:32:53] conul: sooo microsoft good ?
[0:32:55] Oswaldovzki: because money, baby
[0:33:11] atamala: he could easily get a job elsewhere
[0:33:13] witchhobbit: i thought the same about him
[0:33:15] atamala: his resume is stacked
[0:33:21] hulksballs: I think all he did was put a tweet out saying he 'didn't like that he found out he got paid more', or didn't they both send an email complaining about it? BUT... That's all he did.
[0:33:28] funviking99: I don’t think many would have
[0:33:32] Tegger37: disagree on that one.  he's got a family also.
[0:33:32] bettys_dungeon_adventures: oh no what happened now. can someone give me the cliff notes
[0:33:38] Goblinounours: To be fair, he wasn't from Blizzard, unlike Jen, so maybe he thought he could at least test the waters first?
[0:33:40] HSAyril: Do we know that he didn't? That's not something that would be public
[0:33:41] atamala: @bettys_dungeon_adventures microsoft layoffs
[0:33:41] wuubzee: It was an easy gig, getting paid to do m+ DarkMode
[0:33:46] rocthenite: but the boosts tali, the boosts!
[0:33:58] lonesomecowboy: was making fun of him why you got in deep shit with blizzard last year? understand if you like cant answer lol
[0:34:04] grimblymcgoo: @funviking99 Your takes are that of a 24 year old incel, viking 1999
[0:34:16] Tegger37: he's loaded now for sure
[0:34:18] MrScotticus: Yeah, he's posting about taking time off to travel the world now
[0:34:18] slashpuppys: not the people being sympathetic to ceos families lmao
[0:34:20] databob1: Like Microsoft cares who's got a family or not
[0:34:35] liveshowfieldy: does this mean you're not on the naughty list anymore?
[0:34:39] ShadarLogoth: my org is doing layoffs while leaders are getting promotions. I thought it was a more ethical org but clearly no where is
[0:34:40] arcaneviolet: You got in deep shit with blizz?! I missed that.
[0:34:42] Goblinounours: For sure, she had more balls than him.
[0:34:44] Heavyste3l: Hello Taliesin! Been watching your yt content for years! Love it!
[0:34:55] Heavyste3l: SeemsGood
[0:35:00] MeggoArt: whoof
[0:35:01] Tegger37: or blizzcons
[0:35:10] slashpuppys: woman having more balls than men what a surprise
[0:35:10] MeggoArt: F
[0:35:15] lord_konstantine: Best to just let it blow over PR-wise
[0:35:48] Lutiehays: Perhaps a dumb question, but just curious: What did Blizzard do that had you in hot water?
[0:35:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin how can you be mad at blizzard on how they treat workers when palworld lets you enslave humans, beat animals to cruelity, and traffic sell to merchants humans
[0:36:01] MeggoArt: i'm SO mad that Varya seems to be hit by the layoff (because she's EU she isn't out immediately)
[0:36:08] HSAyril: I don't want to seem like some sort of loyalist but we do know he didn't do anything to help her get paid more? Even if she was being paid more after that I don't think something like that would be public
[0:36:11] databob1: @taliesinandevitel  Taliesin was right
[0:36:16] Maievy: Ybarra have congratulate an brazilian Blizzard staff for Spanish Heritage Month, tweeting in spanish. In Brazil we speak portuguese...
[0:36:19] Voidheim: That's a VIDEO GAME
[0:36:22] Vannkier: Tali are you a johnny silverhand enjoyer? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:36:23] rocthenite: "how you do fellow kids"
[0:36:23] hulksballs: It's a game xD?
[0:36:29] lord_konstantine: D:
[0:36:31] wuubzee: He also had the audacity to say that the difference in pay between the devs and him were "exaggerated"
[0:36:33] grimblymcgoo: @neverbornlucky GOTTEM
[0:36:33] hulksballs: Hahahah
[0:36:40] conul: @neverbornlucky you must be mentally challenged or smth
[0:36:44] JoeTheRedcoat: Vidoesganes doesn't real?!
[0:36:45] Runzi333: Trolls be trolling but jeez
[0:36:49] the_howlermonkey: this self righteous outrage against Palworld is dumb af
[0:36:49] databob1: Sounds like a troll question
[0:37:06] brennibrennt: Is that why you don't do Pet Battles? Kappa
[0:37:09] wuubzee: As if we aren't murder hobos in WoW lol
[0:37:23] conul: it does NOT use AI, AI does not work like that
[0:37:24] Darkunh: Its like Burning Teldrasil :)
[0:37:24] Runzi333: from a great height hahahahaha
[0:37:28] tommy2eyes: Why does the entire concept of AI suck?
[0:37:32] JakeSezz: @the_howlermonkey FACTS saltyb27Cheers
[0:37:36] the_howlermonkey: did he say "people should shit on it from a great height"???? HOLY SHIT
[0:37:37] Nulgar: Like I said earlier, just stupid to "save money" on something that would give you good publicity / prevent shitshows like this - instead marketing money is wasted on pointless ad campaigns that do next to nothing
[0:37:40] aeson_of_raid_sock: how can ybarra suck so hard with such a warm and human smile?
[0:37:49] CrossroadsDealer: not “one of us”
[0:37:51] conul: me neither, I have NOT played it
[0:37:53] CrossroadsDealer: ?
[0:37:55] conul: and it does look shit
[0:37:56] CrossroadsDealer: lol
[0:37:58] Durwen: Wait, Mike Ybarra is NOT one of us? BibleThump
[0:38:02] Relax_116: i lub u
[0:38:13] funviking99: some people in this chat are  clowns lol
[0:38:14] Honorbound94: Honorbound94 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 41 months is a lot of months
[0:38:22] RAF_Sean: He does Mythic+ he must be one of us
[0:38:29] Merex760: Wear game t-shirt = one of us poggers
[0:38:39] ShadarLogoth: how did Ybarra leave MS the first time? was he a plant at Blizzard or was he escaping MS?
[0:38:42] atamala: are you a CEO of your company?? tneKhadgarWut
[0:38:48] gefuffel: @tommy2eyes Because its based on stolen work and labor
[0:38:50] skeletonetiquette: I can't believe people didn't turn on Ybara when he was saying how proud he was to be a part of the people who built Blizzard.
[0:38:56] Runzi333: lol
[0:38:57] denflup: is team 2 wow team?
[0:39:15] conul: are they making the shitty story we have?
[0:39:18] neverbornlucky: Taliesin make your Daughter CEO lol
[0:39:28] Vataraa: Do you think AI can be of any good use?
[0:39:40] Heavyste3l: @gefuffel AI as we know it in IRL is nothing like how it should be, it's just another meta verse meme
[0:39:48] funviking99: I like Ion, he is truly one of us
[0:39:49] Heavyste3l: CoolStoryBob
[0:39:55] rocthenite: the wow classic lead post himself getting shadowmorne and invisable in classic wotlk, and his communcation in wow sod is top notch
[0:39:57] cyriosly: cyriosly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! we've made a lot of stream babies, Tali <3
[0:39:58] Reminii91: what about Metzan?
[0:39:59] tommy2eyes: @gefuffel that's categorically untrue. if a specific product uses copywritten art or writing to create its content then yes. that is not a requirement to use AI. there is a ton of products that only utilize content that is proprietary and doesn't utilize the internet.
[0:40:00] Voidheim: @Vataraa as a tool yes, that's as far as it goes right now. AI is not enough to go beyond that point at this moment.
[0:40:02] ButterStains: AI art is just fancy aggregation of other people’s hard work
[0:40:08] aeson_of_raid_sock: Holly with her leather jacket is one of us
[0:40:09] Saevash: and that's what he did!
[0:40:18] Runzi333: It's well known that blizz pays less than most game companies because people want to work on their games
[0:40:23] the_howlermonkey: still not sold on metzen
[0:40:26] MeggoArt: ybarra's weird fake crying on the blizzcon stage..... we should have booed him
[0:40:26] chocobobo16: Holly Longdale?
[0:40:29] JakeSezz: @aeson_of_raid_sock Leather Jacket Holly is BiS Holly
[0:40:30] HSAyril: THERE HE GOES
[0:40:36] JulesMcSwaggerak: 😠
[0:40:38] goldenharpbilly: I mean, look at that smile. He's a corporate boi for sure
[0:40:43] Nontus135: These cuts for sure came down from him. 100% who else would it have been?
[0:40:43] hitchmeister59: The best that can be said for Ybarra was he was willing to pretend to be one with the fans, rather than better than them.
[0:40:47] madmerco: How dare he have been a lawyer before he became a game dev!
[0:40:53] cyriosly: He did call out Asmongold though xD
[0:40:55] Goblinounours: Phil didn't like the hug.
[0:40:58] atamala: still waiting on the tali professor emote
[0:41:00] the_howlermonkey: cant be csuite and be one of us, your life is on a different level than MOST of us will ever know.
[0:41:01] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[0:41:09] Ryall_: Corporate shitbag LUL
[0:41:09] madmerco: Ion gets weird shit for his previous profession.
[0:41:13] HSAyril: HE'S GONE OFF
[0:41:17] CrossroadsDealer: these executives don’t give a shit about workers
[0:41:22] conul: Ion gets shit cuz msot of his decisions were SHIT
[0:41:25] WatchMePlayOnline: devoGOOD
[0:41:29] neverbornlucky: I never trusted blizzard I just love their animation quality in games
[0:41:32] the_howlermonkey: you can be a great humanwhen your not behind the desk.
[0:41:38] Heavyste3l: We want semi sentient cooperative software to help us make redundant mundane work become automated
[0:41:44] RAF_Sean: Force employees back into the office
[0:41:50] Xephur123: One of us! One of us! /sarcasm
[0:41:53] ButterStains: ybarra legit said he’s ready to just “travel the world” now that he’s leaving WoW… doubt anyone getting laid off has that luxury. very tone deaf
[0:41:54] cabeshpash: spot on man
[0:42:06] Ryall_: yeah that's awful
[0:42:08] conul: so all this rant is to say Microsoft good ?
[0:42:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you should tell blizzard wehead is cheaper to buy then meeting in person
[0:42:13] skeletonetiquette: Nod nod
[0:42:27] djalminnha: job is job
[0:42:30] HSAyril: Breath!
[0:42:41] Vunderbrat: I'm glad to see him gone
[0:42:44] gefuffel: @tommy2eyes So basically all of the major "AI" models because they steal copywritten work and to make their models work, it a product does not do that and only content that its allowed to use then thats not what we are talking about here
[0:42:44] conul: hope he goes to apple and ruins them too
[0:42:46] JakeSezz: 💯💯💯💯
[0:42:47] Maievy: DIE CAPITALISTS
[0:42:50] WatchMePlayOnline: preach it my man...
[0:42:50] jarblik: moral managers can't exist under capitalism
[0:42:51] JulesMcSwaggerak: he's a suit
[0:42:52] wuubzee: How long until ppl start asking for Bobby to come back LUL
[0:43:12] gloggins: @wuubzee Never. Launch him into the sun.
[0:43:14] CrossroadsDealer: corporatocracy gunna corporate tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill
[0:43:16] IAmScarlett__: part of me wishes this merger just didnt happen
[0:43:20] atamala: it hurts
[0:43:23] SunjammerIV: so sad that mike "you're delusional if you think CEOs are rich" ybarra is leaving, he was one of us
[0:43:24] mkluvin1515: Kotick sounds like he was a POS on a personal level too, but you’re right about Ybarra
[0:43:25] Nontus135: But he streamed on Twitch and did M+ rooMadSlam
[0:43:30] Saevash: @TaliesinAndEvitel not thinking that things gonna change but we can now at least hope that someone better gonna fill his position now...
[0:43:57] jarblik: 🤮
[0:44:00] madmerco: that's not true... I am $16/month to them. which they use to wipe their assholes with like so much toilet paper.
[0:44:05] Merex760: Mergers always mean less jobs. They suck for everyone but shareholders
[0:44:10] cabeshpash: only positive thing out of this is that Kotick is gone though
[0:44:21] HSAyril: The next person will be treated the same way, "not one of us" and so on
[0:44:29] Ryall_: oh shit yeah they are all vindicated now
[0:44:29] Heavyste3l: Sad that so many people are going to lose their income over this
[0:44:45] databob1: Monopoly law is a joke world wide
[0:44:49] mkluvin1515: @heavyste3l and healthcare benefits here in the US
[0:44:51] Sorin__: that's a large village's amount of people
[0:44:56] IAmScarlett__: this is so corpospeak
[0:45:01] Sorin__: imagine just casually removing jobs from a whole town
[0:45:04] netonkent: Any news on Steve danuser?
[0:45:08] tommy2eyes: @gefuffel I mean, you're just talking about the stuff in the news. In the private sector, there is a metric ton of products that don't use the internet or public works. AI is larger than just Bard and ChatGPT.
[0:45:12] Alonarius: That's made me realise that losing Bobby Kotick is not worth all these people losing their jobs
[0:45:14] Teth33: I'm just mad over the r/wow community having no empathy at all and laughing at 99% of the GMs losing their jobs.
[0:45:15] Heavyste3l: @mkluvin1515 devastating honestly. Specially in this country
[0:45:15] MeggoArt: hyper growth lmao
[0:45:16] Zervanite: A convenient 8-12% of every media and entertainment company. WEird that they're all overstaffed by the same average percentages. All at the same time.
[0:45:17] RAF_Sean: Would love to know how many of the people laid off were pro union
[0:45:25] JulesMcSwaggerak: 🤮
[0:45:27] grimblymcgoo: HE WAS A MOLE THE WHOLE TIME
[0:45:30] mkluvin1515: @netonkent he’s been gone for a while. There’s a reason he wasn’t at Blizzcon
[0:45:30] Tegraine: what a pos
[0:45:37] Omaru7o: TALI exactly why are u mad? the trues is that blizz need to restructure after the buyout and kick some people their games are and wasnt at goodshape for a while except wow that is taking form
[0:45:41] Xephur123: Is that chocolate on his nose? tneEvi
[0:45:41] databob1: Follow his tears to the bank
[0:45:42] ButterStains: read the part where he’s leaving to TRAVEL

[0:46:14] vague_pumpkin: unsure
[0:46:15] Mulajin: nah they said resign please, thanks
[0:46:16] JulesMcSwaggerak: X for doubt
[0:46:16] MeggoArt: can't say until we know the replacement
[0:46:17] jarblik: fuck no
[0:46:18] Voidheim: Nope
[0:46:20] databob1: No
[0:46:20] aurum2509: hell nah
[0:46:20] MuzzaiaH: he decided after he was offered a significant severance bonus
[0:46:21] Avaerus0: He was told he was deciding to transition out
[0:46:21] frankenfoot5: Corporate Overlords love us Tali. Corporate Overlords are our friends.
[0:46:22] Merex760: yea his ass got fired
[0:46:23] Voidheim: x
[0:46:23] gabhion: He was "Helped" to choose
[0:46:24] Xephur123: Walk before the imminent boot?
[0:46:24] aeson_of_raid_sock: I have agreed to be fired
[0:46:24] mkluvin1515: Nah they probably gave him some terrible alternative that wasn’t realistic
[0:46:26] the_howlermonkey: He was a Kotick guy. They aren't keeping that baggage
[0:46:27] Nonyamuff: F
[0:46:28] Harper_n7: "You can resign or we can fire you" guaranteed
[0:46:29] Reminii91: F
[0:46:30] Dezinfector: why not?
[0:46:31] Reminii91: X
[0:46:34] atamala: must be nice
[0:46:35] Bultarski: @RAF_Sean apparently zero union workers were touched. Or that was reported yesterday
[0:46:37] Durwen: "wanting to spend time with family" is corpo for "I got fired"
[0:46:38] databob1: BIg X
[0:46:38] Voidheim: must be nice
[0:46:39] gefuffel: @tommy2eyes Got an example of those products?
[0:46:40] therealnzoth: Cheer100 OH YOU JUST SAW THIS?  THIS FUCKING POST FROM SCROOGE MCDUCK

[0:46:52] sacasa2001: why are u angry? :O
[0:46:52] slashpuppys: whish that were me

[0:46:53] poggersshaman: the world of warcraft?
[0:46:55] Heavyste3l: Mike "one of us" wants to travel the world
[0:46:55] atamala: just like us! just like us! just like us!
[0:46:57] Sorin__: "executives don't make as much as you think" but I do have enough money to travel the world while my former employees can't get their life saving medicine
[0:47:02] MeggoArt: can we get the guillotine
[0:47:05] MeggoArt: please
[0:47:08] mkluvin1515: Yeah…would’ve left that part out
[0:47:09] databob1: Mist be nice to have all that blood money to spend
[0:47:11] tommy2eyes: @gefuffel I mean, literally just look it up online: Lexis+, NetDocs, etc.
[0:47:12] Avaerus0: It's similar to what Politician's say when they abruptly resign, "I wanted to spend more time with the family"
[0:47:14] lellandria: Spending more time with your family? Sounds like someone got caught doing something they shouldn't
[0:47:16] rocthenite: is he going to go backpacking  in europe like a rich white girl?
[0:47:17] teddyg55: damn I wish I could lose my job and be able to still travel the world
[0:47:23] Dezinfector: Well LinkedIn is an incarnation of corporations
[0:47:35] HSAyril: @meggoart are your actually advocating for killing people?
[0:47:37] slashpuppys: @rocthenite nah asia lmao
[0:47:38] CrossroadsDealer: “hyper growth opportunities” fuck off!
[0:47:46] madonniac: @slashpuppys lmao

[0:48:02] mendax55: houses, and health insurance
[0:48:03] mkluvin1515: Yeah that was a bad bad look
[0:48:03] Vaephera: A merger that probably paid him a lot personally, cause he almost certainly had a bunch of stock
[0:48:04] therealnzoth: I GET TO TRAVEL, MEANWHILE PEOPLE WON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE IN 6 MONTHS
[0:48:08] tommy2eyes: What the hell does hyper-growth mean? LOL

[0:48:56] ButterStains: hyper growing his keys, tali

[0:49:38] tommy2eyes: OMG. Hyper-growth = getting carried in hard content

[0:49:48] Alonarius: Join at highest level, sack most the workforce, pay less wages, number go up, leave with massive bonus 😎
[0:49:56] restokin: I hope you're going out for a nice beer after this, Tali!
[0:50:00] JulesMcSwaggerak: I member you saying this A LOT of time

[0:50:21] Vecna00: Companies don't make games, people do.

[0:50:25] SireniaNyx: Absolutely
[0:50:26] Arlaeya: 100%
[0:50:29] Avaerus0: Going public does seem to ruin good companies doesn't it?
[0:50:40] adam_animates: Companies don't care about you, my company doesn't care about you. Never put all your eggs in one company's basket
[0:50:40] the_howlermonkey: going public is a bullet train to evil
[0:50:41] restokin: Microsoft = Borrowed Power.
[0:50:51] hitchmeister59: Capitralism, when money is more important than people.
[0:50:52] teddyg55: But Tali- he has a high IO
[0:50:53] gloggins: @Avaerus0 Employee owned instead of public owned is the fix.
[0:50:59] Chalsean: worked for a semi and it was exactly the same.  buy companies, do layoffs yearly
[0:50:59] Syzmical: money corrupts all
[0:51:05] LordKurgen: you know what makes a game company growth? selling games. you know how to sell games? make them good
[0:51:07] madonniac: Microsoft kills anything and everything that's not profitable enough, so let's just say our prayers 🙏🏻
[0:51:14] IpKaiFung: his ass is fired, so who's laughing now
[0:51:24] Heavyste3l: He is on his yacht

[0:51:46] FourFoxSake: they care more about making good mtx stores than games
[0:51:48] mythryllpala: What kind of trouble did he get you into?
[0:51:53] CrossroadsDealer: by 2030, 40% of all single family homes in USA will be owned and rented out by corporations. the Wall Street housing crisis is happening now. the corpos will eat us and enslave us. :Z
[0:51:54] therealnzoth: Cheer100 Imagaine having a job that doesn't require you move from state to state every 2-5 years.  the industry is fucking broken.  including tech.

[0:52:04] HSAyril: Blizzcon doesn't actually make money, is MS still going to allow the conventions?
[0:52:05] AtomJar: So where is Holly in this? Isn't she considered Corp rather then a dev? But I think she's great for wow
[0:52:08] funviking99: Im tired of companies and their bullshit, I would rather never work than deal with those scumbags bosses
[0:52:11] Husskarl: Husskarl subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:52:18] funviking99: but we need to sadly
[0:52:19] restokin: It's a shame Blizzard sold out in the first place. They'd be sitting on a cash mountain & doing whatever the fuck they wanted if they hadn't done the Activision thing
[0:52:20] Sorin__: gets a nice big consulting check wherever he wants
[0:52:24] IpKaiFung: yeah, he will get a plum job at some other company
[0:52:26] frankenfoot5: It's musical chairs but they always grab another chair from the lower class instead
[0:52:36] Avaerus0: Oh it does
[0:52:37] mindrazor: And always for a better compensation package.
[0:52:39] skeletonetiquette: Sick of the irl min maxing honestly. Shit sucks.
[0:52:40] JulesMcSwaggerak: lots of nepotism and back-channeling in these circles as well
[0:52:41] vague_pumpkin: oh it does
[0:52:57] Avaerus0: We're a bit more subtle about it but it's there
[0:53:01] mitchievous404: you play all the classes
[0:53:03] dalqie: Its very easy to solve this kind of problem. Just hang all execs
[0:53:15] frankenfoot5: Of course class is real, Tali. I play a Paladin!
[0:53:20] therealnzoth: lol
[0:53:29] RAF_Sean: Just eat 1 billionaire. The rest will fall in line after
[0:53:30] cabeshpash: @frankenfoot5 LUL
[0:53:31] ajryssman: @taliesinandevitel at least it's not EA who bought Blizzard
[0:53:34] atamala: enshittification
[0:53:37] LordKurgen: don’t forget the Golden hand shake
[0:53:38] brennibrennt: I didn't follow the news, who is head of Blizz now?
[0:53:43] ButterStains: I vote for eating Elon first
[0:53:44] IpKaiFung: I think we should all hang err hug all the ceos
[0:53:46] gloggins: Is taring and feathering still okay if we use vegan feathers?
[0:53:46] JulesMcSwaggerak: not just growth.... "hyper-growth" 🤓
[0:53:56] Syzmical: classes are cringe, higher wealth only serves to morally corrupt nothing else
[0:53:57] cabeshpash: if only the devs owned the company #socialism
[0:53:57] Avaerus0: I do wonder what happens when people realize infinite growth isn't sustainable
[0:54:11] Husskarl: It is weird how open, entrenched and celebrated class is in the UK. It's like we missed out on an important rebellion or two.
[0:54:16] gloggins: @cabeshpash this is the way.
[0:54:24] HSAyril: Blizzcon gonna get cancelled
[0:54:32] IpKaiFung: they spend all the money on share buy backs
[0:54:32] databob1: @taliesinandevitel  this isn't how things are supposed to work its an abomination. Investors are suppose to give companies  money " hay we have faith in you, have some capital and go prove us right and then we'll  all make money" what we do now is disgusting
[0:54:33] Tibainium: WC3: Reforged was pushed out way too soon because of them :(
[0:54:45] ajryssman: You think Blizzard would shut down Modern WoW to instead completely focus on Classic WoW Plus?
[0:54:49] Sargeant_Fluffy: Thats why almost (if not all) companies that have been taken over by hedge funds/equity firms have gone under. Designed that way
[0:54:50] mkluvin1515: @taliesinandevitel I need to research how corporate ownership works outside the US. I know there’s different rules that you can’t just sell stock as soon as things go bad
[0:54:56] R0kus: Revolution!
[0:54:59] R0kus: Cease the fucking means
[0:55:00] frankenfoot5: Do you hear the people sing?
[0:55:06] SpaZtk: Was blizzcon successful this past year? I feel like the tickets were on sale forever
[0:55:13] Avaerus0: The only reason they would do that is if the players left
[0:55:14] Tibainium: Developing classic+ would be much cheaper
[0:55:18] CeasiusPls: what do we do about that?
[0:55:19] Metket: @ajryssman KEKL
[0:55:22] monkey_d_luffy933: monkey_d_luffy933 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:55:30] denflup: ratio its 3:1 retail:classic
[0:55:33] denflup: its not even close
[0:55:37] CrossroadsDealer: in the same way that in poor areas we see the criminals rich and powerful so we feel that crime is the path to success. in our area only criminals have success so of course the kids think that is the path.
[0:55:37] Alonarius: was that an asmon burner account?
[0:55:40] madonniac: I would quit wow if they cancelled retail
[0:55:41] Tielok: People have such a warped idea about Classic being higher than Retail
[0:55:44] Kinetikx1315: theyve got 3 expansions in the pipe for at least 6 years..they arent shutting it down anytime soon
[0:55:49] Husskarl: I guess we suck it up and go do a dig event :)
[0:55:53] HSAyril: Blizzcon has never actually made money, as far as I know
[0:55:53] lunakinthedruid: Hello Blizz employees, incoming message from Microsoft...Ty for all your input into WoW, and happy 20th Anniversary year...btw, youre fired
[0:55:54] CeasiusPls: loofie
[0:55:54] Chalsean: @SpaZtk ive wondered that myself
[0:55:57] ajryssman: Unless they do a Warcraft IV
[0:56:14] ajryssman: An M-rated Warcraft IV
[0:56:15] kyuubi75: i very very casually play SOD but if retail went away i would cancel my sub
[0:56:16] Sorin__: people don't care about rts games any more lets be honest
[0:56:19] Avaerus0: I don't have hope of WC4 ever coming out
[0:56:19] cabeshpash: I don't think they'll ever make warcraft 4
[0:56:20] atamala: we wouldnt lay off 1900 people but here we are. who knows what the msoft csuite will do
[0:56:23] GingerBear30: they can do that without messing with retail or classic
[0:56:30] cabeshpash: RTS are just dead for whatever reason
[0:56:32] mkluvin1515: Their last RTS was such high quality haha
[0:56:36] ShadarLogoth: RTS makes less than a store mount
[0:56:37] Syzmical: rip survival game I’m in love with that genre
[0:56:37] databob1: I'd rather have another starcraft
[0:56:41] Husskarl: They definitely use the Warcraft IP more than just mobile games and WoW
[0:56:44] cabeshpash: I miss RTS so much tho
[0:56:44] hitchmeister59: If retail WoW cost more to make and maintain they'd drop it in an instant. But that's not the case.
[0:56:46] wuubzee: Yeah, sure... since Reforged was a raging success Kappa
[0:56:52] Chalsean: anything in the SC IP
[0:56:52] lellandria: I'd play it to death, but yeah
[0:56:55] skeletonetiquette: People would buy it but it wouldn't keep making money, so they won't do it
[0:57:01] CeasiusPls: I mean reforged had decent hype, until they messed it up completely
[0:57:04] GingerBear30: I kinda wonder what these "smaller projects" and i really wanted the survival game too
[0:57:10] Tibainium: Oddysey was going to have Samwise's art :(
[0:57:14] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you mean blizzard do a palworld survival game
[0:57:14] Nontus135: Did you read the article about why it got canned?
[0:57:16] mkluvin1515: Did they ever finally add all the features they promised for Reforged? Or was that just abandoned?
[0:57:16] ajryssman: A Warcraft Survival Game set on Draenor?
[0:57:16] Avaerus0: They announce Warcraft 4, then announce it's a mobile game :D
[0:57:17] voidshaper87: is their survival game dead?
[0:57:18] Sorin__: imagine getting rid of a blizzard ip? just throwing money in the sea
[0:57:22] Ryall_: yeah I like survival games its sad
[0:57:23] frankenfoot5: I want a Starcraft FPS so badly. I've wanted it for decades now. It will never happen :'(
[0:57:26] madmerco: by the time it came out that genre would be saturated.
[0:57:26] MeggoArt: maybe it could get recycled like how titan became OW ....
[0:57:31] SireniaNyx: They let go the guy who wrote the singing Sylvanas quest from Vanilla. Istg who picked these people? 12, 16, 18 years of life dedicated to this company!
[0:57:36] cosmopanda13: there were reports about having issues with the engine and that was partially at least why it was cancelled
[0:57:42] CrossroadsDealer: yea come on, a new successful Warcraft game would have to be like Spiderman games. open world with lots of cutscenes and QuickTime button action. that’s what sells now lol
[0:57:45] Avaerus0: They were working on the survival game for what 6 years?
[0:57:46] ajryssman: At least it's not EA
[0:57:51] JulesMcSwaggerak: people with "entrepenuer" in their insta bio LUL
[0:57:52] Husskarl: Could you imagine a Warcraft RPG, maybe BG3/Bioware style?
[0:57:54] bangoobangoo: The reddit take rofl
[0:57:55] Nulgar: I would bet money there was a time when content creators who were looking forward to WC3:R realized that it wouldn't draw that many players, and decided it would bring them more money by just shitting on every little thing that was wrong with it.
[0:58:00] HSAyril: Can't both be true at the same time?
[0:58:01] jhopps12: a certain youtubers yesterday made a comment that the survival must've been bad.. yikes
[0:58:04] AtomJar: Wasn't it apparently in dev hell?
[0:58:07] mitchievous404: can anyone name a company that wasnt made worse by going public
[0:58:12] djalminnha: everything that Blizz release in last 10years is dogshit. HOTS dont exist, Hearthstone is on life support, OW is non existene. That survival game would be a buig question mark
[0:58:22] HSAyril: Survival game not redundant but you have 2 payroll departments
[0:58:24] bladestitch: People bring up Nintendo as an example where a CEO took a cut to save employees. Think there where some laws involved but can you think of any other example where a company actually took care of it's worker? I can't.
[0:58:26] Synkronos: "Your position is now redundant" is just 'We decided we don't want you so we engineered a situation where we could claim your job was the same as someone else's'
[0:58:39] Avaerus0: I wonder if the game was in bad shape or if the higher ups decided it wouldn't make enough money to bother
[0:58:53] SpeciousArgument: World of Starcraft, but only playable race is Baneling
[0:58:58] HSAyril: Right, the game department wouldn't fall under the redundant thing
[0:59:00] Sockfire: It's always 8-12%
[0:59:00] ShadarLogoth: to be fair, didn't they say survival devs were reassigned? I'm sure some were let go though
[0:59:04] Reminii91: maybe the whole game was just not going to work out, from their perspective?
[0:59:12] Reck179: microsoft has another survival game in the makes, therefore blizzards game is redundant LuL
[0:59:15] TaliesinAndEvitel: strawpoll
[0:59:19] Husskarl: Never heard of a merger where this didn't happen
[0:59:19] CrossroadsDealer: you don’t buy a company without established “fat cutting” in the contract.
[0:59:21] bettys_dungeon_adventures: they knew for months prior
[0:59:22] Zervanite: It's 8-12% always.
[0:59:22] witchhobbit: it's all about the numbers
[0:59:27] Zervanite: The number comes first.
[0:59:30] Nontus135: 1900 number came 1st 100%
[0:59:31] Avaerus0: Oh I'm sure it was "we need to cut X people" and then they figure out who's getting axed
[0:59:31] Tegraine: i'm a corporate lawyer. the number is always first
[0:59:33] HSAyril: I don't have any insight to corporate working to say one way or the other
[0:59:36] Nulgar: @bladestitch I mean, not any in the US. That's the key factor. From what I heard today, Japanese companies rather reduce workers' pay instead of laying them off
[0:59:41] SirBarracuda: For sure, because cuts will be based on financial goals
[0:59:43] Chalsean: it was at my corp
[0:59:44] databob1: @taliesinandevitel  even worse they put a price on every one of those people
[0:59:48] ButterStains: arbitrary number for sure
[0:59:50] wuubzee: Saw somewhere they were going to outsource CS jobs... so yeah, not redundant. It's just gonna be cheaper and sucky
[1:00:00] Thenriik: Hey Tali, great to have you here as background while i work on my bachelor's thesis wolfsCOMFY
[1:00:01] frankenfoot5: Nah, Tali's right. Anyone who doesn't understand that either has a discolored nose or enjoys the taste of boot.
[1:00:06] yungspecialk: Was not performance based
[1:00:11] yungspecialk: was earnings based
[1:00:14] mkolbeckart: hey former team 2 dev here, most of my immediate team is safe but there's some big names that were affected that  got let go
[1:00:14] tommy2eyes: wouldn't it be salary to lose instead of a specific number of people to fire? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:00:14] mindrazor: I think a dollar amount came before both.
[1:00:19] mkluvin1515: It was probably like this entire department + % of this department etc
[1:00:26] ButterStains: I think they identified a percentage of labor costs, then decided what percent were senior, junior, etc.
[1:00:27] bladestitch: @Nulgar Yeah, not likely to happen...
[1:00:28] MeggoArt: One of my guildies is one of the CS GMs that got their team axed. Microsoft outsources all their CS -- something that's been happening gradually to wow CS over the years as the team was understaffed and underfunded. The 3rd party CS cannot handle the complexity of wow and do not understand how to help players in this game. it will only get worse now that there are no GMs
[1:00:29] brettlikebread: @mkolbeckart hey dude!
[1:00:30] Nontus135: They said "we need 1900 cut" and then said "What about ppl who aren't on our active games and cut the new game?" "OKAY!"
[1:00:33] hitchmeister59: "We need to reduce the workforce by X."
[1:00:33] Avaerus0: Yeah, it would be odd for it to be exactly 1900 that were redundant rather than a more random number
[1:00:39] bugnitrogen: yip money amount first then number and then who
[1:00:42] Nulgar: Now, don't be silly Tali, of course they didn't just pick a number of employees... they picked an amount of labor costs.
[1:00:47] artisanhughes: 15 absolute capitalist coolaid drinkers
[1:00:48] Sockfire: It's all BS corp talk, don't drink that kool-aid
[1:00:57] mkolbeckart: @brettlikebread Hey Brett!! Howve ya been?
[1:00:57] rydon96: it would of been they need to save "X" ammount of money, and then from there they decided that x ammount = so many jobs
[1:01:02] Synkronos: 15 people either trolling, misclicked, or VERY naive
[1:01:07] teiryn143: I work for a corp.  Been through a number of these.  Supervisor has said before they decide number then do it.  Many times over the years.
[1:01:19] mynameisfd: why is dis a angry stream?
[1:01:19] ajryssman: EA would've laid off the whole WoW team
[1:01:22] Avaerus0: I honestly thought everyone understood the number comes first
[1:01:24] mkolbeckart: @brettlikebread Brett W right?
[1:01:37] Sorin__: external companies can be useful, but getting rid of 12 year veterans is absolutely ridiculous
[1:01:43] mitchievous404: probably didnt say people either, probably said a dollar amount
[1:01:49] mkluvin1515: Are in game GM’s really that expensive?
[1:01:58] Tegraine: 99% chance a lot of those jobs are rehired cheaper or outsourced
[1:02:00] Nulgar: @mitchievous404 yep, this
[1:02:01] CeasiusPls: I see Riot did something similar
[1:02:03] Synkronos: Insulting, but Standard Operating Procedure
[1:02:05] Avaerus0: No but not having GMs is less expensive
[1:02:11] ajryssman: @taliesinandevitel you think Microsoft is watching this right now?
[1:02:13] brettlikebread: @brettlikebread ya! better days for sure, but we commiserated last night and it made yesterday sting just a lil less
[1:02:27] MrScotticus: Companies love exploiting workers in poorer countries
[1:02:28] JulesMcSwaggerak: WutFace no dark mode
[1:02:29] Teth33: We had layoffs at my company earlier this year. They didn't have a number of jobs, but did have a dollar amount they wanted to cut. They then went and laid off a bunch of senior personnel and are now reposting those jobs at 2/3 of what those seniored employees were making.
[1:02:29] hitchmeister59: CS doesn't have to help customers, they just have to keep the loss of subs from bad service lower than they cost.
[1:02:31] MeggoArt: did you see that a lot of the people laid off were also active in A Better ABK? pretty blatant union busting
[1:02:32] mkluvin1515: Yet they make a huge difference when a player does have a CS problem
[1:02:35] Avaerus0: If they can outsource it and have it done cheaper they will
[1:02:45] bugnitrogen: let’s be honest welcome to Microsoft whose founder is known to be ruthless in the past
[1:02:55] mkluvin1515: Which is like nothing in urban CA
[1:02:58] sebnificant: People will be all pro-capitalism and then complain that the game isn't good enough. As if capitalism encourages quality and not being on the bleeding edge of profitability. Quality is expensive, I wish people would understand that.
[1:02:59] Chalsean: which goes nowhere is socal
[1:03:09] Reminii91: mathing POG
[1:03:10] vague_pumpkin: exactly, so freaking expensive to live there
[1:03:11] Sockfire: And how much was Bobby's parachute?
[1:03:12] rydon96: bet they said they need to save 20mill
[1:03:14] mindrazor: PLus benefits
[1:03:21] ironfist423: They can make that 180 mill just from candy crush
[1:03:23] TheSynchronos: i seem to have missed a lot. so they didnt fire just marketing ppl?
[1:03:24] Nulgar: I wish MS stock would just tank for a long while
[1:03:24] denflup: nothing that store mounts cant solve LUL
[1:03:31] OmgItsEdizzle: I can assure you most make less than that
[1:03:40] atamala: my health insurance was 11k in Ohio so it's not that much more really
[1:03:42] 1NessaToday: But this math doesnt account for taxes etc
[1:03:44] mkolbeckart: @brettlikebread I picked a horrible month to take time off of drinking
[1:03:45] Teth33: They will rehire at least 50% at a lower rate of pay.
[1:03:50] AtomJar: I hope we get more info on what happened with the survival game, they announced it then never said anything ever again, sure I read somewhere it was in dev hell but I'd love to know what happened
[1:03:50] mkluvin1515: Or even worse as “contractors”
[1:03:51] RAF_Sean: What pisses me off is that they are still getting record profits. Keep the people and just decrease work load for employees to increase quality of life and improve the product.
[1:03:52] brettlikebread: @mkolbeckart FOR REAL
[1:03:59] OmgItsEdizzle: So is even MORE agregious
[1:04:01] Toenail1203: and the stock always goes up after big layoffs
[1:04:01] RAF_Sean: It's not like they had to cut jobs to stay profitable
[1:04:14] RAF_Sean: 100% agre
[1:04:17] hexbladehomo: And all the big chief execs at Microsoft will get bonuses still
[1:04:19] Kkr0n1xX: i was about to point out that 95k from blizzard takes mid high level positioning lol
[1:04:22] databob1: Agreed
[1:04:23] gygyorggy: I'm glad. The diablo 4 devs are really bad devs with 0 talent. Only the art team is great at blizzard
[1:04:26] goqu3D: Work in game dev and I always thought blizz paid well.. they don't definetly exploiting that dream job situation
[1:04:30] Waxx90: Did the unionized workers keep their jobs?
[1:04:34] Nontus135: UNIONIZE
[1:04:36] Avaerus0: In America the people on the news would call that "communism"
[1:04:40] jiveyivey: It's in the Pizza Parties, Tali!
[1:04:41] duat_auru: gotta unionize
[1:04:50] ironfist423: to another company probably
[1:04:53] mindrazor: Always unions--solidarity!
[1:04:54] Teth33: Record profits, but not a record profit margin. They don't care about the raw number, they only see the year over year growth.
[1:04:57] JoeTheRedcoat: I found out today that Japanese labour laws prohibit mass layoffs except in the case of bankruptcy.
[1:04:59] lonesomecowboy: tneComradeTal tneComradeTal  mass alienation from our own labor will surely be fine eventually
[1:05:10] mkolbeckart: Another thing @TaliesinAndEvitel is that other companies pay significantly more than bliz. The people there are there because they WANT to work on WoW
[1:05:20] mkluvin1515: They could easily pay for the GM cost with what like .50 cents of every monthly sub?
[1:05:26] denflup: 133mil, thats Bobby's bonus
[1:05:30] frenkzors: true lmao, its almost like some people figured out more than a hundred that this type of economy isnt sustainable and produces contradictions lmao, man its fcking bleak sometimes
[1:05:35] Kkr0n1xX: it's bobby's world
[1:05:49] Nulgar: making shareholders a little bit more money by moving the guillotines ever so closer
[1:05:52] bladestitch: Given it has been in the news a lot, do you think they want to replace people with AI things?
[1:06:08] Phil87z: so can we stop with the Phil Spencer love? he sucks like all other CEO’s
[1:06:17] xxLucas: The CEO of the company I work for was the highest paid in my state for years, with the most profit ever and weve had the highest amount of layoffs ever
[1:06:19] Rehstreichler: Worked 15 years for a ninternational corporate and tehy lay me off like nothing in no time after fusion with another competitor. Your not calued in corporate ever, espite on how good you've done your job!! They never care about you!
[1:06:21] Reminii91: 133mil salary is mind-boggling to me from a "Third World" country. You'd think he's printing gold or sth
[1:06:26] mkluvin1515: I would much rather pay a slightly higher monthly sub and then have things like in game GM’e
[1:06:27] frenkzors: record profit vs record revenue, yeah
[1:06:45] Nontus135: More Profit = More Layoffs always
[1:06:48] aeson_of_raid_sock: corporate old gods demand worker blood
[1:06:56] mkluvin1515: @taliesinandevitel isn’t that your net worth?
[1:06:56] Sorin__: less than his payout package yeah
[1:06:59] rydon96: good deal if you ask me
[1:07:00] hitchmeister59: So Bobby's worth more.
[1:07:02] JulesMcSwaggerak: 🤔
[1:07:07] Sorin__: if they paid bobby slightly less they could have kept everyone
[1:07:08] Husskarl: Once again the people who produce the value barely see any of it. tneTaliShill
[1:07:17] rydon96: great deal
[1:07:20] therealnzoth: @aeson_of_raid_sock HEY DON'T LUMP OLD GODS IN WITH CEOS, THEY ARE THE REAL VILLIANS
[1:07:21] ironfist423: we live in a society moment
[1:07:21] rydon96: take it everyday of the week
[1:07:21] vague_pumpkin: boo
[1:07:23] Ryall_: executive salaries and payouts are class warfare
[1:07:25] ShadarLogoth: 70k? try 150k with benefits
[1:07:28] Avaerus0: But you can't cut his pay, he's part of the ruling class
[1:07:31] Mixin88: Bobby Kotick is not worth of nothing
[1:07:34] jarblik: he doesn't do anything, he's worth less
[1:07:38] Teth33: They laid off 1900 people so 1.5 people at the top of the pyramid can still make more money than most people see in their lifetime.
[1:07:41] grimblymcgoo: @ShadarLogoth wItH bEnEfItS
[1:07:43] gygyorggy: I hope the people who wrote the df story arw gone
[1:07:48] ramzie0: I think I read that they weren't going to be replacing Bobby
[1:07:50] Sorin__: it's hard to believe bobby kotick is worth more than one of the people laid off
[1:07:52] atamala: @ShadarLogoth thats insane, my benefits aren't that worth 80k
[1:07:53] Sargeant_Fluffy: Ya, what work can a CEO possibly do that is worth 1300% more than the median pay of workers?
[1:08:00] Pentacus: “we need to save 200M!” then why didn’t you only only give Bobby 100M to fuck off instead of 300M?
[1:08:02] HSAyril: Didn't Bobby needed to be voted out, and most of the board were people he knew?
[1:08:08] CeasiusPls: I doubt cheapskate MS would match Bobby Kotick's salary to the next stooge
[1:08:10] Avaerus0: Imagine how much money AI CEOs would save /s
[1:08:11] mkluvin1515: Even $150k is still very affordable labor in CA
[1:08:27] Reminii91: CEO if you're the CEO
[1:08:29] Synkronos: If I have the choice of ZERO people, or Kotick, I take the zero people every day
[1:08:35] goqu3D: The majority of those people are definetly not even making 70k blizz is notorious for underpaying despite their stature in the industry
[1:08:35] Triskelian: "Benefits", when ultimately the cost of them comes out of your paycheck
[1:08:41] frenkzors: and thats just the CEO not even talking about the rest of the so called "c-suite"
[1:08:43] Husskarl: How about you just elect a worker to be CEO.
[1:08:50] Noznatation: it should be the devs. - but in todays market, prob. the ceo :D
[1:08:50] CrossroadsDealer: since 1978 average pay has gone up 15%… CEO pay has gone up 1209%!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:08:53] BajaBlasta: What value does he add
[1:08:55] ironfist423: mad world
[1:08:56] pDLjay: REPLACE CEO WITH AI GoldPLZ GoldPLZ
[1:08:56] jeldin: didnt the CEO*s of Nintendo took a paycut once to retain their workers??? thats how it should be
[1:08:58] Kkr0n1xX: @mkluvin1515 Tell that to the millions that live there and make no where near it XD
[1:09:05] Rehstreichler: @Pentacus It will always be like that, senior management take the money for themselfes ;-)
[1:09:06] Sorin__: every person gets to be ceo for 1 day
[1:09:07] Husskarl: tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal
[1:09:08] ShadarLogoth: CA salaries aren't that low even for CS staff are they?
[1:09:13] Toenail1203: usually the base pay is 1-2 million, then all the stock options
[1:09:13] lobawow: lol
[1:09:15] Alonarius: Why? Know any companies whose workers own the company??
[1:09:16] cabeshpash: socialism but close enough lol
[1:09:16] gygyorggy: They have so many employees and yet they can't make a few end game bosses in diablo 4. So glad they are gone thanks God
[1:09:22] grimblymcgoo: CEOs return wealth to shareholders. They DO NOT make any company or product better
[1:09:27] Avaerus0: From what I've read software devs can make more in non-game development, so just working in the industry means they make less money
[1:09:27] R0kus: Communism just wouldnt have ceo?
[1:09:30] mkluvin1515: @kkr0n1xx oh I’m w/ you just trying to prove that the cost of living there is so much higher, so harder to compare
[1:09:31] BumbleMoonHive: Wouldnt that be more socialism?
[1:09:32] JustJord: @TaliesinAndEvitel  what about chris metzen for leader.
[1:09:32] Sargeant_Fluffy: Aren't there some scandanavian countries that require workers to be on the board?
[1:09:33] Synkronos: Workers are also shit managers tho. It's a different skillset, developing and managing. Fuck CEOs tho
[1:09:36] astralumi: yes
[1:09:36] Husskarl: Im a dirty commie ;)
[1:09:51] frenkzors: communism = stateless, classless, moneyless. socialism = workers own the means of production
[1:09:51] P0gybait: I work in engineering and there is a distinct difference between the line worker and the skill set of upper management... some people will never (Nor do they want) to leave the cubicle.
[1:09:52] hitchmeister59: "Workers control the means of production.'
[1:09:55] cabeshpash: socialism is like communism evolved, communism is a truly classless society
[1:09:55] HSAyril: Your dollar is my dollar
[1:09:55] Dezinfector: Under the communism the CEO would be elected by workers
[1:09:59] Avaerus0: I suppose the workers could elect a CEO
[1:10:03] MrScotticus: Communism is a classless, moneyless, stateless society. Socialism is when workers own the means of production
[1:10:03] R0kus: CEO isnt a useful job tho
[1:10:04] mindrazor: It won't get passed, but Bernie Sanders and some Dems introduced legislation last week that will tax companies extra if they pay the CEO more than 50 times the average worker in the company.
[1:10:07] BumbleMoonHive: Comunism is more removal of countries and what socialism has i think
[1:10:11] Nontus135: Only Workers should be share holders. :)
[1:10:11] cabeshpash: yeas
[1:10:16] cabeshpash: he's right
[1:10:17] pDLjay: Sad to see Mike Ybarra go he was #one of us LUL
[1:10:17] astralumi: @frenkzors that's anarchism, pretty sure
[1:10:22] Pentacus: workers get 1 month as severance, CEOs get more than that worker’s entire lifetime earnings
[1:10:22] aurum2509: love how we went from people being layer off to communism lmao
[1:10:22] frenkzors: yes it does im literally a communist lmao
[1:10:23] Avaerus0: There's not just one kind of socialism
[1:10:25] Nulgar: whitewashing Communism tneEvi
[1:10:26] Triskelian: @gygyorggy GTFO of here with that take, just because you don't like what they're doing with D4 doesn't mean they devs deserve to lose their jobs
[1:10:29] Saiyori: A union would be nice lol
[1:10:31] Akaveary: *laughs in oligarch*
[1:10:31] DaniRobayna: socialism = *any phrase apparently*
[1:10:35] Zervanite: Americans really coming out of the woodwork to define communism wrong, aren't they?
[1:10:35] jarblik: Kappa
[1:10:45] Saiyori: @Zervanite always
[1:10:45] RAF_Sean: Let's be fair though to Kotick. We don't know how much the insurance is on a ferrario
[1:10:46] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL true
[1:10:47] astralumi: @Zervanite as always
[1:10:48] XlorepDarkHelm: Communism is the book Animal Farm :P
[1:10:50] Omaru7o: socialism, communism , same shit doesnt work either
[1:10:51] RAF_Sean: farrari*
[1:10:56] gygyorggy: Chat GPT doesn't care about unions :)
[1:10:56] RAF_Sean: Ferrari**
[1:11:05] Ryall_: workers can co-own a cooperative business within any type of government, I like coops
[1:11:09] Sorin__: capitalism clearly doesn't work
[1:11:11] atamala: i dont wanna be glue
[1:11:16] Durwen: Man, you are being awfully clippable today
[1:11:17] Husskarl: Orwell was a socialist though.
[1:11:30] mkluvin1515: …wait, the horse didn’t just get sent to another farm like my parents said?
[1:11:31] Pentacus: “socialism is satanism, because they start with S and end in ism” -Americans apparently
[1:11:33] Alonarius: Lmao because capitalism is working right now
[1:11:37] cabeshpash: it was a good rant
[1:11:37] Ghand0ur: Just joined. I am assuming the 70k is the average salary and 1900 are the number of people fired?
[1:11:38] frenkzors: LUL yeah i mean your point still stands ofc i didnt mean to nitpick, just clarify, apologies if it came across poorly
[1:11:39] DaniRobayna: o7
[1:11:42] Husskarl: Agreed
[1:11:45] pDLjay: Capitalistic Socialism SeemsGood
[1:11:50] Synkronos: "Angry Stream" is the title, it was always going to be Clip Central LUL
[1:11:52] Saiyori: Unions pls
[1:11:53] P0gybait: "that's called profit sharing" alot of companies do it now
[1:11:54] Rehstreichler: Your a king or a worker, like the ants
[1:11:56] R0kus: Not side tracked. When you talk about workers rights, you will always arrive at socialism.
[1:11:57] Nontus135: I think no one outside of the company should own stock.
[1:12:02] gygyorggy: I think the workers who made uber lilith should have nothing
[1:12:03] tommy2eyes: How brain dead do you have to be to think Animal Farm is anti-communist?
[1:12:12] tumtuhm: i'd have to say i've been most productive when i have a stake in something than a boot on my neck
[1:12:12] Husskarl: It's better than profit-sharing
[1:12:13] astralumi: people still think "capitalism = market" so they think communists want to abolish commerce...
[1:12:15] catherea: Isn't that more of an ESOP?
[1:12:19] Avaerus0: Animal Farm is anti-Stalin
[1:12:21] Saiyori: profit sharing can also be bonuses, my companydoes htat
[1:12:24] TheDeekins: chatter conflating profit with equity
[1:12:26] mindrazor: Wages are theft.
[1:12:30] VelcroNinja: We're just men... we're just innocent ment.
[1:12:33] DaniRobayna: hahahahaha
[1:12:35] frenkzors: LUL true
[1:12:36] Zervanite: I don't know any of those words.
[1:12:36] jarblik: KEKW
[1:12:45] oiye_: I cant stand that guy
[1:12:47] CrossroadsDealer: But Tali, YouTube videos told me Communism is evil and doesn’t work and only capitalism is a legitimate form of society!!!
[1:12:48] cabeshpash: lol and ben carson
[1:12:55] mkluvin1515: Bonuses that companies can just pull a Blizzard and then take away when the time comes
[1:12:56] Saiyori: the jungle defines communism well
[1:12:59] Nulgar: petty bit of the day: using Bing to google er search for "how to cancel game pass"
[1:13:04] TomCat: TomCat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! I agree
[1:13:11] Rehstreichler: So whats the bottom line, we are all working for Microsoft in the end? Cause they own the planet with Appla and Amazon ;-)
[1:13:14] lonesomecowboy: i think unfortunately a lot of people especially americans are extremely susceptible to CEO PR because so many ceos and politicians just sort of ghoulishly laugh in our faces constantly, so to have someone like ybarra who is stilla corpo shitbag but who cares a lot about optics will win a bunch of normal well meaning people over unfortunately but idk
[1:13:14] denflup: no
[1:13:20] aurum2509: I’m quite new here, are all of these streams tali arguing with his chat over things that are a complete side track from the original topic?
[1:13:22] HSAyril: On a lighter note, did you see US scientists wrote a book that adding salt to your tea makes it taste better
[1:13:23] Nighthawke21: whichever the NHS and social security is, I like that one
[1:13:27] Noznatation: It was even how facebook started
[1:13:29] Triskelian: @Nulgar You get the petty confetti today, my friend
[1:13:33] Bundschuh: can i buy stocks?
[1:13:36] pDLjay: I knew you were a commi Tali, You are SO anti Hyper growth NotLikeThis
[1:13:43] denflup: its easier if the company is super small
[1:13:47] tumtuhm: can i come work for you?  i make great coffee
[1:13:50] Toenail1203: Evi would sack you to make room :p
[1:14:01] aeson_of_raid_sock: glad to tune into another episode of Commiesin & Stalintel
[1:14:02] R0kus: at least equal pay from the start, because your work is not worth more than someone elses.
[1:14:02] GoldSmog: I accept your offer
[1:14:02] JulesMcSwaggerak: but tali, what about hyper-growth?! Corpa
[1:14:02] lonesomecowboy: damn you adding a third person to the company sounds like a hyper growth opportunity
[1:14:03] mkluvin1515: Lol you should send Evitel a corpo layoff email today
[1:14:06] astralumi: of course not
[1:14:07] DaniRobayna: you thrive if the company thrives in small companies
[1:14:09] CrossroadsDealer: hyper growth! hyper growth! hyper growth tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill
[1:14:10] lobawow: @astralumi no they make commerce but only for themselves, the best example how is socialism  is Venezuela my country
[1:14:13] Triskelian: The shareholders
[1:14:16] Sargeant_Fluffy: billionaires
[1:14:20] Avaerus0: As long as it brings value to the shareholders /s
[1:14:23] denflup: who am i to decide how much money can a billionaire make?
[1:14:30] Husskarl: And people say there is such thing as a free market hahaha
[1:14:31] hitchmeister59: At some point a company gets too many people for that to remain tenable.
[1:14:32] Nontus135: Company value is directly tied to infinite growth and then we wonder why inflation always goes up LUL
[1:14:33] tommy2eyes: Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil war alongside communists and socialists. Like, can you even read to think Animal Farm was somehow an anti-commie novella?
[1:14:37] frenkzors: but there are coops that have 100s or even 1000s of employees large chatter, and it works pretty great tbh
[1:14:39] Sargeant_Fluffy: Every billionaire is a olicy failure
[1:14:42] jarblik: 3 people benefit, 8 billion people suffer
[1:14:47] CeasiusPls: Open source is important
[1:14:48] R0kus: A company's "worth" is also complete bogus in most cases. Based on the feelings of a guy in a suit who thinks a share is worth something and therefore a company is worth that.
[1:14:49] P0gybait: Do you have car?  An Iphone? Any  tech that takes R&D?  It's having excess capital that allows for investment.
[1:14:51] denflup: thats not even remotelly the same
[1:14:53] Avaerus0: We as a society collectively decide what is and isn't allowed
[1:14:56] JulesMcSwaggerak: I love how "hyper-growth" is becoming a new sarcastic meme to us LUL
[1:14:56] Phil87z: corporate consolidation is always bad
[1:15:00] gygyorggy: They didn't steal the money. We give them money
[1:15:02] astralumi: @denflup it actually is
[1:15:12] denflup: i mean i get what you saying, but murdering its not equal to wealth
[1:15:19] grimblymcgoo: @P0gybait A car wasnt made by a trillion dollar company my man
[1:15:22] Runzi333: we could do that lol
[1:15:23] Sorin__: wage theft is the biggest form of financial crime in the world
[1:15:23] Noznatation: honestly not much easier, u just say that like 30% of the company is staff shares, and whenever someone joins the firm, they get a % of that, on borrowed company money. Which means that when they stop they just get extra profit.
[1:15:27] professor_cullman: come for Tali's looks and stay for his opinions (and also looks)
[1:15:27] frenkzors: they literally did, its called surplus value extraction LUL
[1:15:31] skeletonetiquette: They are having a say in how much most of us make xD
[1:15:33] Zervanite: They say not knowing how most billionaires made their money.
[1:15:34] Avaerus0: Something can be bad without being actual theft
[1:15:35] ShadarLogoth: anti-monopoly laws were likely intended to prevent super large corps
[1:15:37] Husskarl: Bruh doesn't know about wage theft haha
[1:15:40] CrossroadsDealer: did you see the new world economy report that says we will see the first trillionaire by 2030? so crazy.
[1:15:41] Ryall_: we are so close to the majority waking up and realising billionaires shouldn't exist
[1:15:41] Atomicpanda: billionaires existing is a bigger hurt to society than just about anything.
[1:15:42] P0gybait: Yeah really... noone is forcing a gun to a morally righteous head and forcing you to work for them...
[1:15:42] TheSynchronos: true
[1:15:45] ErkyDog: Capitalism is beautiful
[1:15:45] Sargeant_Fluffy: I mean if you live/participate in a society, you literally create the environment for that billionaire/multi-national to thrive
[1:15:45] astralumi: @denflup disproportional accumulation of wealth, in the scale that we have right now, cause a lot of suffering and death on a large scale
[1:15:48] Phil87z: people love defending billionaires. it’s brain rot that they can do it themselves
[1:15:48] DaniRobayna: freedom doesn't mean stepping on 99% of the population is ok
[1:15:50] Nulgar: imagine picking this of all streams to stan the super-rich maybep7Hehe
[1:15:54] skeletonetiquette: What right do they have to decide how much we make?
[1:15:57] Avaerus0: The most common way to get rich is inheritance yes
[1:15:58] tommy2eyes: Costs of production are offset by exploitation of labor.
[1:15:58] ErkyDog: pfffff
[1:16:01] ErkyDog: ok
[1:16:02] goqu3D: people who defend billionaire are the biggest cucks imaginable
[1:16:03] HSAyril: I don't think government should step in to say how much you can make, I do however think the richer you are the way more you should get state taxed. We also need to include an much increased capital gains tax
[1:16:04] Teth33: Billionaire's are the leading cause of death in a capitalist society. They make money on the back of others suffering. Always.
[1:16:06] mkluvin1515: We invent that here in the US to get people to try(and hide the class thing Tali mentioned earlier)
[1:16:08] gygyorggy: Not the case with microsoft
[1:16:17] Pentacus: “who am I to decide how much a billionaire can make” “who am I to say if people can murder each other” there’s a very neat solution to both of these questions tbh…
[1:16:17] LordKurgen: don’t worry, trickle down economics will start working soon
[1:16:18] Triskelian: @Nulgar He's just salty because he's butthurt over D4
[1:16:25] P0gybait: ***
[1:16:28] jarblik: masses brainwashed to believe in meritocracy
[1:16:32] OILTIME: @P0gybait The vast majority of the evaluation of these companies is in stock. Not in liquid money they can invest in R&D.
[1:16:40] aeson_of_raid_sock: bill gates family was wealthy
[1:16:42] Runzi333: generational wealth is statistically how most people are millionaires
[1:16:42] shaxxtv: people have no clue.. dont even try talie
[1:16:49] Ryall_: those silicon mines were worker heaven
[1:16:50] tom_badil_: @Avaerus0 Ye and thats why were fucked, to many ppl get their arse handed over by Rightwingers and capitalistic bellends, the result is the State we are in right now and it will burst in 70-100 Years.
[1:16:58] CrossroadsDealer: so funny how many people think all these billion dollar companies started with boot straps tneTali tneTali
[1:17:01] magemaster225: Xerox in the corner crying
[1:17:03] DaniRobayna: People writing fanfictions of billionaires in garages as always
[1:17:06] gygyorggy: They also did a lot of good and charity
[1:17:06] pDLjay: Billionaires have lots of economic capital but at least we have our community as in social capital. So who is poor now ^^
[1:17:09] mkluvin1515: “That’s right” I type on my Apple iPhone while browsing on Amazon
[1:17:11] Atomicpanda: people defending billionaires because they know someday they'll be billionaires too.
[1:17:20] ButterStains: yeah so they can get tax write offs
[1:17:20] tom_badil_: @CrossroadsDealer Ye right, Musk just worked VERY hard for it naitanKEKW
[1:17:21] Tandy000: It's surprisingly how wealthy you can be when you don't value human life.
[1:17:24] Husskarl: All of MCs capital investors were all self-made millionaires who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.
[1:17:25] Nonyamuff: Didn't know MS made chips
[1:17:25] Triskelian: @gygyorggy Because all the "charity" was tax-deductible
[1:17:26] tentenbits: humble bill gates.. build MS as a dropout [...from f'in Harvard]
[1:17:27] duat_auru: sl--
[1:17:27] tommy2eyes: Why do people love to cuck billionaires and corporations so bad?
[1:17:28] ButterStains: and it doesn’t make up for the harm caused by
[1:17:30] Raghoulash_: skipped! 😆
[1:17:31] Sargeant_Fluffy: charity is a pr laundering scheme
[1:17:31] MrScotticus: They wouldn't need to do charity if they didn't exploit people
[1:17:34] Nontus135: Get 'em!
[1:17:39] gefuffel: @gygyorggy man you are so dumb if you believe that that wasnt just for good pr and they actually did more harm than that
[1:17:42] frankenfoot5: GET EM TALI, GO FOR THE KIDNEYS
[1:17:44] jarblik: props to tali to having the patience to dialogue with actual bootlickers <3
[1:17:53] Atomicpanda: it's in their name
[1:17:55] denflup: So, if i dont cause harm, hipoterically, could i be billionaire then without been judged?
[1:17:57] Nonyamuff: Relied yes...made no
[1:17:59] tom_badil_: @Atomicpanda ye poor creatures, they defend that very thing which destroys us all but hey, lets not properly tax them and ease the tax on ppl with minimal wage, cuz that would not be faiiir
[1:18:03] mkluvin1515: Computers were made of wood duh
[1:18:07] Avaerus0: Microsoft have sold hardware since the 80s, mice etc.
[1:18:07] astralumi: i think the biggest problem with the "capitalism vs communism" conversation is that everyone is eager to defend their opinion, but most of the time their point is just not true... it's based on misinformation. most people have no idea what communism is... i only learned a few years ago!
[1:18:08] judgedredd1975: yes they do look @ where our raw ore comes mined in deplorable conditions and every company that uses the materials to make their batteries knows this and benefits greatly from this
[1:18:10] R0kus: Also the whole reason we are having this conversation is because Microsoft JUST fired 1900 people turn their lives upside down, just to have a good story for shareholders
[1:18:11] FatCatDad48: Xboxes work on magic then?
[1:18:12] aurum2509: damn this is a shit show
[1:18:15] Noznatation: Bill Gates would even agree on this point
[1:18:16] Nulgar: hey fellas, think we might see Spiderman today? tneTrundleMaldini
[1:18:17] Goblinounours: So Microsoft had lots of potato farms run by slaves to make their chips?
[1:18:18] CrossroadsDealer: ah the classic “I have a contrarian opinion without knowledge of the topic!!!”
[1:18:19] pDLjay: Microsoft, Macrohard all the same stuff anyways WutFace
[1:18:22] DaniRobayna: loving this stream
[1:18:24] aeson_of_raid_sock: the gates family was wealthy to start
[1:18:25] neverbornlucky: Taliesin , Bill Gates is 10 times better then Elon Musk thankfully
[1:18:26] frankenfoot5: Nobody makes a billion dollars by being a good person
[1:18:27] Jack_the_Dipper: do you have proof?
[1:18:28] JulesMcSwaggerak: chat, we gotta protect tali from getting one-guy'd LUL
[1:18:31] P0gybait: and you are handing Microsoft and similar tech companies how much money for their products?    Encouraging them to make more?
[1:18:31] Avaerus0: It's not possible to get that rich without screwing someone
[1:18:33] HateField: isn't the capitalist apologist thinking that their profits are conjured out of thin air and their winning isn't anyone else's loss?
[1:18:36] CeasiusPls: Even Notch and Concerned Ape?
[1:18:36] Sargeant_Fluffy: See, Tali he thinks he'll be rich some day, so he to defend the rich now
[1:18:37] gygyorggy: But you are using their products...
[1:18:39] TankenFunk: It's really hard to make a billion dollars without exploiting workers, resources, land or all of the above
[1:18:39] Husskarl: Even if he never intended to cause harm, the system is set up in such a way where it happens regardless.
[1:18:39] lobawow: 1st fact about microsoft they bought the first Operativ4e system DOS for only 10000 dollars
[1:18:40] frenkzors: and thats just the most direct harm, not even talking about surplus value extraction from workers
[1:18:43] Keskers: Damn chat read a book, microsoft is built on theft

[1:25:31] GameingAspect: yer ppl like tht are weird
[1:25:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you are bad person cause other people don't have a working computer and you are worried about your working computer

[1:25:55] Husskarl: @TaliesinAndEvitel Aaaah. But you live in society!

[1:26:01] Nulgar: "my computer's vey slow" "yet you use a computer, curious"

[1:26:08] Noznatation: We should - but honestly it is just too late.
[1:26:09] warpride777: hedge funds buying blocs of homes young people can buy at market price but artificial supply drives the price up and demand up which then drives the price up even further, the banks are betting you buy overpriced homes
[1:26:09] OneTrueKako: @TaliesinAndEvitel lets not forget capitalism seems to be better than it is because the CIA made sure to sabotage anyone trying something else
[1:26:10] frankenfoot5: "Hey, I'd like to fix a problem within society." "lmao okay, you communist"
[1:26:12] mkluvin1515: I think capitalism is fine, but it’s out of control here in the US, and there’s no real way to change it while we allow the corporate influence on our government
[1:26:19] formerredclaw: Is it as bad that the company, Microsoft, hired the 1,900 employees in the first place. I feel the anger would be better focused on the irresponsible hiring of erroneous employees during boom times. But instead usually people celebrate these hirings and acted outraged when the employee s are deemed unnecessary
[1:26:19] Nonyamuff: Capitalism is coded by blizz...
[1:26:21] TankenFunk: @Nulgar This really makes you think 🤔
[1:26:24] bonoir: @deatheran so you have to own a factory to be a capitalist now?
[1:26:26] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you so rich you have a computer while some people just want a grain of rice
[1:26:34] bladestitch: Wonder if there should be a clause that employees can keelhaul CEOs if they act like assholes. Probably wouldn't solve anything but maybe the moral would be improved...
[1:26:41] tommy2eyes: Capitalism is only a few hundred years old. Given the lifetime of human civilization, people think we already created the perfect economic system.

[1:28:27] Teth33: Unfettered capitalism is a failure no matter how you look at it. Just like any other "ism", the purist form of the concept is unattainable and horribly flawed.

[1:29:29] pDLjay: The chance of getting rich is keeping everyone working. Its pretty selfregulating in that way. Even though the access to those chances are completely unfair.
[1:29:39] mkluvin1515: I just think if we can remove the corporate influence on our government and refocus our government on the people’s best interest - that’s the 1st step towards fixing things
[1:29:40] tom_badil_: @tommy2eyes Ye the first 50~ of 150 years were good overall for the people in USA/West and Central Europe whilst the rest of the World got fucked by us but well such a system is deemed to doom us all which it does in the last 70~ years. People just cant accept it, esp ppl who dont want to realise what political bodies they gotta vote for and that it doesnt end there, protests are key.

[1:33:46] cynicalcode: Revolutions can still happen, they just look a lot different. In 1950 life expectancy was ~60 years of age. Now it's ~80. Those in power simply last longer now.   The real threat is that rich dickheads know this, and are actively hacking the system (with money) to retain power. E.g. USA Republicans DEFUNDING EDUCATION. That's like bond-villain style shit.

[1:35:39] Ganryu22: but Vietnam was fucked it all
[1:35:41] Ganryu22: crazy
[1:35:43] formerredclaw: The problem was caused by the same people and system you are mad at going and trying to share profits with these 1,900 employees by hiring them to do a job for a time. If the work they provided led to more profits they would not be losing their jobs now. The people/system you hate are the risk takers that put their money on the line to give these people a chance. The employees failed to hold up their end and they paid for it with their jobs.
[1:35:53] pDLjay: there's a cushy socialism for the rich and this kind of brutal, merciless capitalism for the poor
[1:35:55] teddyg55: @TaliesinAndEvitel But would we ever do that? In the West we developed the welfare state as a compromise with the left to keep them from going full communist. With no USSR around as an alternative, Western capitalists have no reason to even consider left-wing policies
[1:35:58] Avaerus0: I read part of the reason CEOs weren't payed ridiculous amounts back then is it would have been considered "unseemly"

[1:36:22] tom_badil_: It could be so easy. States gotta take back Infrastrucral areas like Health,travel,energy etc, so they dont relie on profits and share holders. Remove income tax for ppl who earn 40-80k a year. Ease tax on ppl who earn 100-400k a year. Introduce proper Financial transaction and Asset Tax on Billionaires, so that they cant accumulate Money which just lays some where. We could finance so much shit with it, like even independent economics tell us that for years but ppl wont listen to them peepoSad

[1:39:06] warpride777: true
[1:39:07] frankenfoot5: After spending the past few months hanging around Baldur's Gate 3 forums, the Blizzard online fanbase is just exceptionally toxic. That's something I wish we could do something about

[1:40:18] frankenfoot5: Yeah game's great rn (returning player experience aside). But I doubt 1900 people were causing issues with the game
[1:40:20] bonoir: We'll have to wait and see

[1:40:22] CloudyHS: xbox has enough cash on hand to support those 1900 employees for like, thousands of years

[1:40:44] DHStom: I'm angry because a lot of my friends were working on that survival game. :(
[1:40:46] formerredclaw: Microsoft doesn't owe you a game that you like. If you like it you will buy it. If you don't like it you wont buy it. Stop acting like a company's goal is to do something for you.
[1:40:47] hitchmeister59: It not like they announced that they identified the people making un-fun systems in WoW and sacked them, so overall things will be better.
[1:40:48] mkluvin1515: @noznatation how many devs do they need? Blizz does less w/ more than any other developer
[1:40:52] Teth33: WoW players: Wow is in the best state it's been in years.  Microsoft/Blizz: Awesome! Layoffs to celebrate?
[1:40:54] TankenFunk: It's not gonna happen, but theoretically it could happen tneEvi
[1:40:55] blumberquack: @Noznatation If anything that'd be too many cooks in the kitchen :p
[1:40:55] Kshantos: fewer devs means fewer ideas they have to work on
[1:41:07] Deatheran: @CloudyHS but that wont make stonks line go up
[1:41:20] d0mezg4mer: it's not fair leadership isn'
[1:41:26] CloudyHS: someone said "layoffs should be last resort if the company would cease to exist otherwise, not to impress investors during an earnings call"
[1:41:27] Saumur: For as long as you can pay your managers millions, you dont have to fire 2k workers
[1:41:34] frankenfoot5: "It's one video game, Michael. How many devs do you need? 10?" - Lucille Bluth.
[1:41:35] Avaerus0: WoWs doing well? Quick, how can we squeeze some more profit out of it!
[1:41:38] Sargeant_Fluffy: Maybe they want 1900 fresh eyes for a new IP?
[1:41:38] Tandy000: That's the dig. The way they ARE getting those billions is by firing people like this.
[1:41:39] bladestitch: What you brought up about forcing people to move then fire them made me so angry. Should be made illegal with prison time. Makes my blood boil.
[1:41:40] random_redshirt: Maybe the shareholders could eat less avocado toast
[1:41:43] unfailable: So much for Thrall saying "family" in the merger announcement trailer huh?
[1:41:52] Husskarl: @TaliesinAndEvitel They leave with a golden parachute
[1:41:55] The_Old_Man_Plays: Maybe processes needed to be streamlined. I dont support wholesale firings (excuse me.."layoffs") but how many repetitive positions does a company need?
[1:41:56] pDLjay: Maybe Metzen cost them 300 million
[1:42:01] darkshadowq_27: Dame happen with the fcking banks
[1:42:04] OneTrueKako: Out of curiosity do we know what departments people got fired from? My understanding was it was more support staff
[1:42:05] Parkreiner: They do their job, which is "make money line go higher"
[1:42:07] Teth33: We laid off 3% of our workforce at my company. 1 week later our stock went up by 10%. Fuck shareholders.
[1:42:10] R0kus: If you need 130 millions dollars, you can also fire a ceo. Hard Drive has a great article about all the ceos that gave up their pay to save the company.
[1:42:11] TankenFunk: The higher ups SHOULD take the blunt of it, considering "they take all the risk," but that argument is only ever used when it's about profit
[1:42:16] Noznatation: To be fair - he earns so much money that he would die in avacado toasts before he even notice it on his account
[1:42:20] CallipygianBear: the only responsibility higher ups have it to the shareholders. the idea that CEOs have any sort of ethical responsibility to their employees went the way of the dodo. :(
[1:42:23] CloudyHS: @TaliesinAndEvitel btw, they forced people to return to irvine and then laid them off after uprooting their lives, classy
[1:42:28] grimblymcgoo: @The_Old_Man_Plays Have you made a help ticket in wow recently? That department needed more workers, not a layoff
[1:42:29] Sch1ey: Has microsoft tried making coffee at home yet??
[1:42:31] The_Old_Man_Plays: @CallipygianBear This is the truth
[1:42:31] skeletonetiquette: They can only do so much! It's really tough to get up in the morning and get dressed.
[1:42:32] shoppeguy: i am surprised that they killed the new survival game i do wonder why?
[1:42:42] CloudyHS: Kappa one of us
[1:42:46] Noznatation: OneOfThem
[1:42:47] bonoir: The people who left should make a game to compete. Revenge arc
[1:42:48] pDLjay: ONE OF US: HYPER GROSS
[1:42:53] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel have we gotten any news on severence package or anything?
[1:42:57] Avaerus0: I wonder if the forced move was in part a way of getting some people to resign?
[1:42:59] d0mezg4mer: ybarra being gone is a silver lining
[1:43:02] neverbornlucky: not the first time blizzard has killed games people wanted. Remember StarCraft Ghost
[1:43:07] karioke19: wait.. I thought I pay for a subscription each month AND each expansion to keep people working at blizz and the game good? but it’s not? ..
[1:43:11] mkluvin1515: Back to the office located in the most expensive location possible because…reasons?
[1:43:14] mkolbeckart: @mkluvin1515 WoW takes a LOT of devs to be created and ran. A loss of devs= a worse quality.
[1:43:17] Marach: Tbh I kinda expected it it was actually less than I expected...
[1:43:25] shoppeguy: yep i know just curious what the reason was
[1:43:34] Goblinounours: @TaliesinAndEvitel Bit of a silverlining, but maybe some of those who were fired will get to go work in a better place. Maybe some of the existing splinter-groups like Frost Giants, Second Diner, etc?
[1:43:36] Noznatation: Yeah some people getting fucked due to work visas
[1:43:36] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel this is industry wide btw, while most places wont force people back full time. ive seen most people back 1 to 3 days a week
[1:43:38] themummah: It was clear that Ybarra was put in place cos he had the right face and the right standing to fulfill their needs at the time. They wanted a person who players could relate to. He was then paid his nice little bonus for fulfilling his post. Cos he is no longer needed as the court stuff has passed. Ybarra worked for MS for 20yrs-I am not of the mind to think that he wasn't chosen for 'reasons'
[1:43:38] Ryall_: in response, gamers should really be making ethical choices about which games they purchase but let's face it, it's an addiction and the investors know it
[1:43:43] The_Old_Man_Plays: Ybarra leaving is a net positive
[1:43:45] Pentacus: I miss when Iwata took two 50% pay cuts rather than fire a single Nintendo employee
[1:43:48] bladestitch: My friend is of the opinion that it should be illegal for someone to be a billionaire and I agree with that. Noone ever needs that much money.
[1:43:49] pDLjay: When I saw Mike Ybarra's stage presence at blizzcon I knew he was a corporate bully
[1:43:49] mkolbeckart: That call was one of the main reasons why I decided to leave Blizz
[1:44:11] bonoir: People can vote with their dollars
[1:44:12] Synmadd: Hi Tali. Thank you for talking about this stuff. I watched Bellular's video about the layoffs and made the mistake of reading the comments, almost felt like crying.
[1:44:13] karioke19: because return to work is used to cull workers without having to fire them
[1:44:18] mkluvin1515: @mkolbeckart but company wide, for many years the products have not been great given their resources compared to much smaller companies
[1:44:23] Ryall_: @bladestitch I agree
[1:44:26] CloudyHS: not that this softens the blow at all, but something i noticed is that it doesnt seem like anyone on the wow dev team got hit by the layoffs, interesting that they left them untouched
[1:44:32] Zervanite: @bonoir So you're saying people with more money should be able to vote more???
[1:44:33] MrScotticus: People with more dollars get more votes
[1:44:35] DemonZodiac: i canceled my wow sub, but that wont do anything unless everyone stopped playing
[1:44:37] TheDeekins: it's the shareholders, not the consumers, that they care about
[1:44:37] skeletonetiquette: How does dude who got fired vote with his dollar??????
[1:44:38] R0kus: I don't have dollars
[1:44:38] Kshantos: only rich people can "vote" with their money
[1:44:42] Dred_Scythe: Voting with your dollar thought process died a long time ago.
[1:44:42] HolocronCoder: "Vote with your dollars". What dollars? The billionaires took them all
[1:44:43] bonoir: Yes
[1:44:46] Metket: @DemonZodiac why would i do that LMAO
[1:44:46] CloudyHS: exactly
[1:44:50] formerredclaw: Of course people vote with their dollars
[1:44:50] frankenfoot5: I've always enjoyed the joke that as soon as somebody has 1 Billion dollars in net worth (they don't *earn* that much money), we should just give them a plaque that says "Congratulations, you won Capitalism!" and freeze their assets
[1:44:51] Smeson: Vote with dollars means more dollars = more votes. Fuck that
[1:44:54] HSAyril: Me
[1:44:55] Husskarl: Considering how much property Microsoft owns, you would find it hard to vote with your dollars.
[1:44:58] R0kus: It will hurt me because I will miss my druid
[1:45:00] pDLjay: If I had 69 billion I could buy Blizzard and fire all the douches ^^
[1:45:04] mkluvin1515: They’ll just lay more people off easy
[1:45:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesin sadly this will be like the last scandel from blizzard. People will feel bad but then after a while it will be  business as   usual
[1:45:09] blumberquack: Just returned, we talking about boycotts? :p
[1:45:12] bladestitch: @frankenfoot5 XD
[1:45:14] TankenFunk: If people stop paying for subs, they stop working on the game and shift their focus to a more profitable game
[1:45:22] hitchmeister59: Eventually all of them, but the C-tier last.
[1:45:24] Parkreiner: Voting with my 40k a year wallet against 3 trillion dollars, makes sense
[1:45:28] Triskelian: @blumberquack Yep
[1:45:29] skeletonetiquette: So then by that logic dude with most money has most votes yeah? Damn we're in the same position. Damn.
[1:45:38] blumberquack: Personally I'm cool with people wanting to boycott but if they're saying they're doing it to 'make an impact' they're just lying to themselves lol
[1:45:40] bonoir: And people don't really care that they done care
[1:45:42] formerredclaw: Phil Spencer adds value to Microsoft beyond wow. Some 2k devs that only make wow add value to Microsoft because of wow
[1:45:43] themummah: they only care about PROFIT margins
[1:45:46] DemonZodiac: no optimism for the future @Metket
[1:45:47] Avaerus0: Phil just wants everyone on Earth to sign up for Game Pass
[1:45:47] bangoobangoo: But he said that thing about playing Diablo with his friends or whatever rofl
[1:45:47] Ryall_: blizzard investors do not care about video games
[1:45:49] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel at this point they are a bank... just money making more money
[1:45:53] netonkent: They could just bring out one mobile game and it would make up the lose of wow players
[1:45:58] pDLjay: They would just stop the servers and still be filthy rich while moving towards another Hyper growth area
[1:46:00] Synmadd: @neverbornlucky many people don't even feel bad sadly. Because if you make a videogame they don't like you don't deserve empathy
[1:46:11] bonoir: Palworld is based
[1:46:17] Phil87z: CEOs are not your friend
[1:46:17] CloudyHS: @TaliesinAndEvitel and its not like making profits is any different, they are clearly still willing to do layoffs in the face of massive profits.
[1:46:18] Goblinounours: Fuck Palworld.
[1:46:18] d0mezg4mer: been refreshing to see people realize asmon is an ass
[1:46:20] Saumur: The interesting thing is: TOday we look back at some medieval kings and are like "Wow, these were absolute tyrants!" And looking on most companies its just the very same, somehow
[1:46:21] Metket: @DemonZodiac its your opinion, not everyone's
[1:46:24] Noznatation: To be fair asmongold is one of them aswell :D
[1:46:31] blumberquack: The palworld drama has swarmed my social media pages for over a week now, I just don't care LUL
[1:46:33] ItsLtLavender: to your point - likes of Phil S care about revenue. If revenue drops, they whip their management into shape… one hopes?
[1:46:40] ETS05: the only thing that will it, is for employees to unnionize
[1:46:41] DaniRobayna: I could listen to Tali for weeks nonstop
[1:46:48] onestheloneliest: best way to vote is with your votes
[1:46:50] hitchmeister59: Asmon: "I hate it when people mildly inconvenience me by protesting."
[1:46:55] Husskarl: It's just totally ineffective
[1:46:58] formerredclaw: So the general public are so stupid they don't make decisions with their own money?
[1:47:00] aragarde: what would be the ideal solution then, in an ideal world talie?
[1:47:00] CloudyHS: "voting with your dollars" is a cop out for people who dont want things to change
[1:47:01] pDLjay: Would love a tip jar FOR the devs not the higher ups SeemsGood
[1:47:07] Avaerus0: That would just tell MS people are tired of WoW and they should fire more people
[1:47:07] IAmScarlett__: would i be in the wrong for still wanting to play wow
[1:47:09] frankenfoot5: Yeah the UBISOFT CEO the other day was even floating the idea of making all games a subscription service just to really fuck over people
[1:47:10] Sargeant_Fluffy: ya voting with your wallet is about as useful as personal recycling
[1:47:11] brennibrennt: Violence!
[1:47:12] Nontus135: UNIONIZE
[1:47:15] bonoir: We also vote with our attention is data is worth more than oil these days
[1:47:17] TankenFunk: REGULATIONS! UNIONS!
[1:47:19] Metket: boycott in game with wondering ancients KEKW
[1:47:19] CloudyHS: EZ
[1:47:19] aragarde: :D
[1:47:21] Husskarl: Based
[1:47:22] aragarde: EZ
[1:47:22] Ryall_: preach
[1:47:23] JulesMcSwaggerak: what was that?
[1:47:24] cupcakeboxes: same
[1:47:24] Radiopools: @formerredclaw I meeeeean.......
[1:47:24] mkolbeckart: @mkluvin1515 theres a lot more too it than just "too many devs = a worse product" Clear leadership makes a HUGE impact on a game
[1:47:24] The_Old_Man_Plays: a corporation this big means that they can push out shitty games and nobody really notices or cares. Starfield is meh, but Microsoft moves on. D4 is a mess but Microsoft will move on
[1:47:26] Husskarl: tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal
[1:47:28] JulesMcSwaggerak: didnt hear you there LUL
[1:47:31] Merex760: based
[1:47:32] warpride777: sounds like a path in the right direction
[1:47:33] JimothyOnline: Gigachad take
[1:47:35] Tenga66: hasRaid hasRaid hasRaid hasRaid
[1:47:36] Deatheran: the problem with "voting with your dollars" is that for it to affect management, its got to DECIMATE the working people.
[1:47:36] frankenfoot5: Hey, Tali, can you say that louder for the people in the back?
[1:47:36] DemonZodiac: regulate it is the only option
[1:47:40] ItsLtLavender: hear hear
[1:47:45] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do you really want to make us stop playing wow and play diablo4 season 3
[1:47:49] TankenFunk: Regulations?! Sounds like 50s capitalism to me tneComradeTal
[1:47:50] siphuros: and send Jack Welch down the memory hole
[1:47:54] artisanhughes: Put a cap on individual and corporate wealth
[1:47:59] mkluvin1515: Which is exactly the problem when the corporations stop that from happening via lobbyists etc
[1:48:01] DaniRobayna: ye, laws!
[1:48:02] forsakenwolf1028: fucking true
[1:48:02] aragarde: What you talking about, i got nano plastics in my water
[1:48:09] CloudyHS: having 1 person with enough money to pay for healthcare for the country and solve homelessness permanently is pretty sick
[1:48:10] pDLjay: The air would be polluted also
[1:48:11] Radiopools: Regulations? Sounds like liberal bullshit to me Kappa
[1:48:13] gachimane_: oh yeah? what else would yo do? gachiBASS
[1:48:14] westvo: employers don't fear the workers like they used to
[1:48:14] blumberquack: @neverbornlucky I've been itching to get back into D4, traps sound pretty cool tbh
[1:48:14] Tenga66: dsaPRA dsaXIS
[1:48:15] CeasiusPls: Lobbyists corrupts regulation
[1:48:15] Osirisson: Honestly I work for regulated utility and I finally have a living wage and feel secure for the first time in my life.
[1:48:20] DemonZodiac: @TankenFunk thats the idea, minus the racism
[1:48:22] Noznatation: The issue is voting in a country like usa is never gonna matter unless someone like Tailor swift makes a new party - cause u cannot as a none rich person start a party and expect to get any say
[1:48:24] pDLjay: Trash would be everywhere
[1:48:25] Avaerus0: Too bad in the US at least our politicians have largely been bought off
[1:48:27] blumberquack: that or a game like Last Epoch/Grim Dawn
[1:48:30] ugliestcreature: like all those poor people in third world countries we are exploiting :(
[1:48:31] Tenga66: dsaUnity dsaUnity dsaUnity dsaUnity
[1:48:31] MuzzaiaH: that's just a lil cute bonus
[1:48:33] CloudyHS: stop i can only handle so much based
[1:48:35] bonoir: Guillotine 🔥🔥🔥
[1:48:36] grimblymcgoo: High tax rates maintain money flowing
[1:48:40] Sch1ey: lucidSlice
[1:48:42] mkluvin1515: Can’t regulate when the corporations stop change
[1:48:48] Sargeant_Fluffy: The wealthy people that dont want to be regulated have convinced the people that regulation is bad lol
[1:48:51] frankenfoot5: Regulations? Sounds like a communist to me. I want a *free *market* where my corporate overlords can cut all costs they arbitrarily deem unnecessary
[1:48:54] madmerco: 80's and 90's deregulated a whole bunch of things that were well regulated in the times that all the boomers want to return to...but they don't want to hear that.
[1:48:55] wecao19: It's always refreshing to come to your stream in these situations. Sad times for gamers :(
[1:48:56] bonoir: Agreed
[1:49:03] Husskarl: It represents capital interests
[1:49:06] DemonZodiac: yeah the regulations are being made by the corporations now
[1:49:08] Phil87z: we just have too many boot lickers in America
[1:49:10] Ryall_: without regulations corpos will dump toxic waste at your local kindergarten
[1:49:11] MeggoArt: have you ever seen images from the 1941 disney animator's strike? those dudes hauled out the guillotine for walt lmao
[1:49:12] CloudyHS: BUT TALI THINK OF THE HYPERGROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
[1:49:12] Trebled_Mind: guillotine is cutting edge technology. Really a-head of its time.
[1:49:15] hitchmeister59: There's too many layers between the representatives and the people.
[1:49:20] themummah: doesn't matter who gets into power. they will carry out the same things. Just in their own manner
[1:49:21] karioke19: @sch1ey that is the cutest guillotine!!
[1:49:26] Ryall_: @CloudyHS LUL
[1:49:29] Triskelian: @Trebled_Mind Bad pun, no biscuit :D
[1:49:34] bladestitch: Don't be a dick?
[1:49:40] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel as said, bobbies "goodbye" package was enough to pay for all 1900 employees to work another year and then some.
[1:49:41] Husskarl: That's a pretty sick t-mog tali
[1:49:52] TankenFunk: I think we should just put up a few guillotines here and there, just for view. Not to be used, of course. Just as a historical fragment, you know?
[1:50:02] Avaerus0: Not everything should be driven by the profit-motive like say health care
[1:50:06] Nulgar: "too big to fail", but, like, in a benevolent way
[1:50:07] madmerco: how in 2024 the internet is not a regulated utility like power, water, and telephone in the united states is baffling.
[1:50:09] MuzzaiaH: but if they're not focused on making a profit they'll not work hard enough! /s *1000
[1:50:21] bonoir: Bobby is a goblin IRL
[1:50:22] frankenfoot5: Oh my god, don't get me started on For-Profit Prisons
[1:50:24] HSAyril: I think I like Japan's policy of making mass layoffs illegal unless you've announced bankruptcy
[1:50:31] aragarde: Make me the supreme overlord of the world, ill destabilize all the corporations :D
[1:50:33] Ryall_: LUL
[1:50:37] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel if we are being real, id include living realestate in that "to important" list
[1:50:38] netonkent: I thought you was going to transmog haha but was transport
[1:50:39] OneTrueKako: Out of curiosity do we have a picture of who got let go? For example I thought it was more support staff not devs
[1:50:41] Saumur: Well they are the ones working the hardest to avoid taxes...
[1:50:41] pvalue01: anyone who's worked a corporate job knows that the higher your rank the less work you do
[1:50:48] MuzzaiaH: japan does have other issues in it's labour laws but that bit is alright
[1:50:48] Husskarl: That would be a very good change tbh
[1:50:50] Farmoure: If hard work was all you needed for success, african mothers would be the richest people on the plant - I read that somewhere once
[1:50:51] TankenFunk: Yes, people go into game development to *checks notes* make money...
[1:50:53] bladestitch: What a difference it would make if just one thing in soceity would be made free.
[1:50:54] PhatKiwi: I for one lie awake at night just wondering how I can create more value for shareholders /s
[1:51:03] Sargeant_Fluffy: Housing4All
[1:51:11] BeeboBiggins: What happened to Steve Danuser
[1:51:16] mkluvin1515: Layoffs should require companies to prove they have no other option and would cease to exist without them
[1:51:22] HSAyril: Danuser?
[1:51:23] SireniaNyx: Overwatch got gutted.
[1:51:28] Husskarl: @ErikTheSwift Metzen locked him in a box.
[1:51:28] CloudyHS: ow2 got destroyed
[1:51:28] SphericFormula: Will it cause a big stirr on WoW twitter when it's announced
[1:51:29] funviking99: BibleThump
[1:51:30] tan_41: are u playing a female char or body type 2 char ? :)
[1:51:34] Teth33: While support was hardest hit, there were several in leadership positions in dev teams that I know of.
[1:51:38] MeggoArt: wait high level devs that haven't announced yet?
[1:51:38] Noznatation: Holly still there - so blizzcon cosplay is thankfully saved
[1:51:38] mkluvin1515: Daniser is LONG gone
[1:51:38] Parkreiner: Overwatch got the HotS treatment
[1:51:41] Saiyori: is denuser leaving?
[1:51:44] Runzi333: Yeah customer service is always hit with layoffs
[1:51:46] bonoir: Body type 2 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[1:51:49] HSAyril: Metzen taking Danuser's place?
[1:51:51] djalminnha: Danuser is not in the team anymore after Metzen came back
[1:51:52] IAmScarlett__: ow2 got fucked
[1:51:54] Zervanite: OW was annihilated.
[1:51:55] netonkent: After have blizzcon I would raid if holly went
[1:51:56] pDLjay: Wait Danuser is gone?
[1:51:57] blumberquack: Yeah, OW2 devs got destroyed :p
[1:52:01] aragarde: ow let me down tho
[1:52:04] funviking99: this means that wow is gonna be shit again doesn’t it?
[1:52:04] mkolbeckart: Diablo got hit hard too
[1:52:05] Husskarl: OW dead IP now?
[1:52:09] epsilon_el: tbf OW was hit hard when they announced OW2
[1:52:10] HolocronCoder: Not too surprised. OW died years ago. Just taking a while for the body to give up the ghost
[1:52:10] Runzi333: I've seen some younger diablo devs so far too
[1:52:11] Avaerus0: It looks like the writing is on the wall for OW2
[1:52:13] shanamation: one of my best friends got caught up in the survival game layoff
[1:52:13] goldengrubate: @bonoir  🤡
