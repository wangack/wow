[4:07:26] purekupo: I know the feeling
[4:07:27] purekupo: lol
[4:07:45] JimmyBigmoney: @Thunderbrew Yes since you can buy gear with gold

[4:08:11] Niksen_99: Did you grind honor to gear up or M+ ? @Swifty
[4:08:12] Thunderbrew: @Thunderbrew So WoW is play to win?
[4:08:16] purekupo: no, becuase most of player already full gear in rank
[4:08:19] Zerost0rm: if you buy progress* for token gold it kinda is
[4:08:20] Thunderbrew: Pay to win
[4:08:20] frankey500: yeah i bought alot of tokens too when i was getting full tier 3 warrior set from black market
[4:08:25] stokes_t: you been having more fun on retail  or classic? kinda wanna pvp some

[4:08:53] Z3ph1c: he is using stamina food buff and priest buff i bet
[4:09:02] JimmyBigmoney: @Thunderbrew Yes, but not as much as other games. But as long as you can buy gear with gold (and bliz is selling it), its pay to win cause; better gear = win
[4:09:14] purekupo: how pay to win ?! >.< since all player can get the same gear dudes!!  pay to win when u can only gear by gold

[4:09:47] JimmyBigmoney: @purekupo You can buy BoE's on AH with gold. So it's pay to win that way
[4:10:06] JimmyBigmoney: But luckily not as bad as other games :D
[4:10:13] swiftengage50: @purekupo that gear isnt top tier

[4:10:30] spore420: because alliance just aren't about the pvp life
[4:10:38] Z3ph1c: I think most pvpers buy tokens these days
[4:10:45] Tomoglaziat: its kool the other streamers beg for gold so...tehe
[4:10:47] swiftengage50: @JimmyBigmoney pvp gear is earned 100%
[4:10:48] LukeLuphin: Funny how people seem to accept P2W, I'll personally never accept it. I quitted all games that added P2W
[4:10:53] Niksen_99: Does alliance have faster ques than horde? @Swifty
[4:11:01] bedheaded: You have 4 set?
[4:11:10] JimmyBigmoney: @swiftengage50 True, but you still skip some sort of grind that you would do if you dont have that kind of money
[4:11:18] swiftengage50: @Niksen_99 yea
[4:11:19] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Codename: Indigo by Harris Heller -> https://prtzl.io/xyHAPPLK3pebwZtE
[4:11:22] Thunderbrew: @LukeLuphin So you don't play World of Warcraft?
[4:11:38] Zerost0rm: pay to win is when you progress faster or get better gear than grinding yourself and therefore takes longer time
[4:11:42] Niksen_99: Ty! :D Sorry but also on EU? :D @swiftengage50
[4:11:48] swiftengage50: @JimmyBigmoney grind what exactly? farming herbs and professions?

[4:12:01] Megameak: @Swifty Is wow worth getting back into after a long break?
[4:12:34] Thunderbrew: @Megameak I say no for Retail. Shadowlands stinks
[4:12:40] MadredBoy: not retaiil, classic yes
[4:12:40] JimmyBigmoney: @swiftengage50 No, if you have gold enough to get good gear, you would skip the "gear grind", and therefor skip ahead of other people.
[4:12:43] Imsosorryxo: the hunt has a stupid range .. it doesnt make sens to be like that xD
[4:12:44] xxwheybolicxx92: i mean it is afetr the grind

[4:13:20] senortes: swifty como haces para motivarte,   para seguir jugando sin cansarte de wow
[4:13:24] Amethystaz: getting gear isnt as bad as before though @Swifty
[4:13:31] Pescado_55: I just came back to wow after not playing since WoD. I'm enjoying it a lot.
[4:13:36] Megameak: I normally only pvp, is there any disadvantage for this in current game?
[4:13:36] TitanSnakeTV: its alot less of a grind this season than its been so it's worth it SeemsGood
[4:13:38] JimmyBigmoney: @swiftengage50 Also you can: Buy money -> buy boost for gold -> buy better gear -> win
[4:13:40] Rastafaris: WoW can be repetetive aswell
[4:13:42] Thunderbrew: I won't play Wrath Classic without Group Finder. I don't have the time
[4:13:48] Niksen_99: New expansion comming up! Go prepare your characters. Its always fun :D
[4:14:01] notDingo: came back to wow recently after long break, community blames devs for ruining it, reality is, its mostly the community, new or returning players are treated as bad as lepper gnomes
[4:14:08] akkatest: if you come back you'll probably enjoy just playing either way. you're gonna be rusty and probably not able to play as good anyway

[4:53:18] cosmicblood84: 75
[4:53:19] Ceehad: 40 to 75ish
[4:53:19] Shalyon: 75
[4:53:21] Ascendor81: the new jailors gauntlet
[4:53:22] truition: off pieces cost less, think its 1250 for gloves
[4:53:25] alfredpigeons69: 75
[4:53:30] cosmicblood84: to 50
[4:53:32] Ghettoskippy: Go to Torghast
[4:53:34] sake_xo: you get flux from solo shuffle too
[4:53:35] jesmark18: yes
[4:53:37] Shalyon: thorgast layer 13
[4:53:46] Ascendor81: group a lvl9 or do the gauntlet
[4:53:47] Inriden: do a viewer torghast
[4:54:01] SevCorvo: so do you want to convert pvp conq pieces to tier only? or does it matter?
[4:54:03] Shalyon: u get cosmic per bg, epic bg and solo shuffle win
[4:54:04] cosmicblood84: you 300 flux form brawl each day
[4:54:10] Capafelipe: you can buy flux with cifers
[4:54:15] Inriden: exactly!
[4:54:25] SevCorvo: i mean does it have to be a pvp piece
[4:54:31] Ascendor81: yes you can buy flux from cifers as HAVEN
[4:54:35] cosmicblood84: i can carrie you in tourghast
[4:54:44] 7thSaga: i think chests in Zereth mortis is a good way to get cosmic flux and theres TONS of chests around there
[4:54:52] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: New Direction - Alternate Version by  -> https://prtzl.io/9GH5M4e1pQV93Qc9
[4:55:01] Ascendor81: yea vendor at HAVEN base
[4:55:05] Ascendor81: under shield
[4:55:12] Ascendor81: no?
[4:55:12] lenestusss: You can buy flux
[4:55:14] Tazzad: Chests in Zereth Mortis only gives 200 cosmic flux once though
[4:55:22] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:55:43] SevCorvo: is the idea to fully upgrade the pvp piece before converting to tier chat?
[4:55:44] bennysenseibro: then u watch this
[4:55:52] bennysenseibro: priest stealthing like rogues etc
[4:56:01] cosmicblood84: well if need a carrie on tourghast let me know @Swifty
[4:56:12] cntrlndelete: swifty! going DK or WAR in WOTLK for you? :)
[4:56:12] Inriden: maybe some people can run you thru the gauntlet torghast, that should give you a bunch of flux. plus its not as boring to run. its all boss fights
[4:56:49] ironmouse34: I'm not seeing any vendor that sells flux in Haven
[4:57:05] spore420: fight rogue with rogue
[4:57:09] Ascendor81: so maybe only TORGHAST
[4:57:19] Ascendor81: you can see before you enter torghast, how much it will offer
[4:57:22] cosmicblood84: - @Swifty  i can do up to lvl 14 tourghast now btw

[5:10:42] Shalyon: not worth it
[5:10:46] cosmicblood84: its a waste
[5:10:47] Shalyon: farm rares better
[5:10:47] Tazzad: Gauntlet gives a lot more
[5:10:52] Ascendor81: it gets higher with higer layers
[5:10:53] Blair79: 15 runs
[5:10:54] cosmicblood84: too long
[5:10:57] Shalyon: gonna take like 30 min
[5:11:00] slothkappacino: @Swifty the flux isn't the reward of those
[5:11:02] Ascendor81: Do gauntlet
[5:11:04] sake_xo: I think you'd enjoy doing 3s more
[5:11:07] Ghettoskippy: Do jailers gauntlet
[5:11:08] Cowardpatty: On your rogue, have you already went around and get all the 1-time 200 cosmic flux chests in ZM?

[5:11:45] 7thSaga: NomNom NomNom NomNom
[5:12:03] Ascendor81: 15mins
[5:12:12] Tazzad: Bad wording on my part. For all of them*
[5:12:21] Shalyon: if u could win rbgs u would get a ton of flux too
[5:12:29] Cowardpatty: https://youtu.be/qzt-vBW_BH0?t=38

[8:09:57] sake_xo: i tried, doesn't do enough dmg unless everyone is perfectly stunned / cc'd
[8:10:18] 인터넷포트: no im saying even swifty is using it but hes running dustwalker legendary isnt he
[8:10:22] tolginyoo: swifty as a n.elf female rogue, i'd never expect to see that :D
[8:10:32] sake_xo: your bleeds / sepsis is doing a lot of dmg, and master assassin is 100% crit from stealth
[8:10:47] 인터넷포트: hes not using that i dont think
[8:10:58] sake_xo: ask him
[8:11:06] 인터넷포트: but hes still doing it the vanish/envenom i think someone taught him wrong
[8:11:19] sake_xo: no
[8:11:31] sake_xo: which legendary you using swifty?
[8:11:45] 인터넷포트: right but why vanish
[8:12:01] theasylumfitness: for 100% crit
[8:12:03] sake_xo: because vanish is giving the 100% crit to everything
[8:12:06] theasylumfitness: hes using crit leggo
[8:12:19] 인터넷포트: oh ur not using duskwalker
[8:12:25] 인터넷포트: i see whats going on
