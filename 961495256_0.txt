[3:52:44] LoafGecko: yeah but you are clouted and they are not
[3:52:45] Bubonicc: streamer beta Pog

[3:52:55] Lazarenth: addon developers should get in the first wave
[3:52:56] teler9000: No invites OkayChamp It's how Overwatch and Hearthstone were so big on release and it still works to scam you fucks LULW
[3:52:57] sithius75: @AndyTime i think it's mostly if you play as a melee, not that much for casters
[3:52:57] smgski3: who did you get as your third for f2k?
[3:52:58] Antelic: @sodapoppin ever since Wotlk, i have applied to every single Beta for wow. i have never been invited to any of the betas so far.. i cri every tiem

[3:53:00] gfvaris: @sodapoppin do you think dungeons would be way more fun with dps meter

[3:53:08] club420: mrgm said they culled the list a lot cuz many people who got into classic didnt play the beta when they got it
[3:53:09] NaturalHighX: Leddit Streamer privilege
[3:53:09] jabrizzleton: wouldnt the ones made for the private servers work? theyre basically already geared around TBC @sodapoppin

[3:53:30] Julienpleb: Are the T-Shirts$12? I remember you talking about them around new years.
[3:53:31] Frostyfux: beta is for bug fixing, not marketing
[3:53:32] bdranck: if only everyone could play the game like this
[3:53:33] Nomadstrot: they did
[3:53:33] NaturalHighX: Hmm continue
[3:53:34] EdLok_: the level cap to 64 is also weird
[3:53:35] Xtrasneaky: Hmm
[3:53:35] GrenganBC: Why do people not from NA get the beta invite?
[3:53:35] sirmiras: popCat
[3:53:36] weyw0t: " free marketing " what a gigabrain take
[3:53:36] Grament: none f us non streamers are suprised

[3:53:40] aparky: its an only friends and family beta as of right now
[3:53:40] GameN8ion: yet its no different than every other beta for most of us since barely anyone is invited regardless
[3:53:41] 2crazy4wordz: hi soda
[3:53:41] JesseDwf: Hmm maybe activision did it
[3:53:43] Akiiru: Hmm
[3:53:44] CVB111: Hmm the downside
[3:53:44] Sauronix: They want to do waves of invites i think
[3:53:44] Nomadstrot: because streamers are most impoirtant
[3:53:45] teler9000: Frostyfux Kapp
[3:53:46] Duelshock13: exclusivity
[3:53:46] wardoo_: WeirdChamp Let the addon guys in to help the longevity
[3:53:47] Everdot: maybe they wanted to avoid stream sniping
[3:53:47] Saketume: why would blizzard want addons
[3:53:47] nixonprime: @sodapoppin it was the same way in original classic beta. You have an opt in but they have selection bias on who gets in outside of stress tests.
[3:53:48] Reticent_88: @ThatsProto Yeah mb
[3:53:49] PocketRave: because its not a real beta but just marketing
[3:53:51] gfvaris: there are working addons out there :P worked like a charm on pservers
[3:53:51] Nomadstrot: only streamers matter
[3:53:53] tomandhuck: im supprised apes got in , the ones that gatekeeped the raid dungeon xp exploit are in to find out another exploit they can abuse on launch
[3:53:53] 0rbis: popCat
[3:53:53] notismeisenpie: potatoe servers can only handle one or the other ?
[3:53:54] laddergoat_: Hmm
[3:53:54] Masmackles: Server cost
[3:53:54] NaturalHighX: Hmm the council will consider your point
[3:53:54] DjemDruid: soda does athlete the hpala stream?? pls
[3:53:55] CorruptArkangel: sodaHmm
[3:53:55] HarryBlopper: tuna got invited
[3:53:56] Hobo: activison sees $$$
[3:53:56] diarog: @Everdot lmao?
[3:53:58] ThatsProto: Thats bananas
[3:53:58] EdLok_: ZULUL
[3:53:59] Dugrim_: yeah its literally day 2 lol
[3:53:59] itamar_1902: oh my god free marketing? THAT'S WHY THEY INVITED STREAMERS how didn't anyone think of that
[3:53:59] Argentide: peepoHide
[3:53:59] HandofRag: i think youre totally right
[3:53:59] Tempuren: no downside but activision is just Pepega
[3:54:00] Rudywulf: tbh if they invited too many people the risk of streamer content turning into watch me get stream sniped on repeat increases
[3:54:01] JesseDwf: Hmm activision hates add ons confirmed
[3:54:02] buhtterstick: they're probably using some PC in a spare cubicle to run the server
[3:54:02] billoh: b/c blizz is a smally indie company and can't handle the server load
[3:54:04] madsol_: why a streamer only beta? what is the point
[3:54:04] Raxxlian: @sodapoppin addons aren't even allowed right now, prob that's why
[3:54:05] Sauronix: Next week probabl
[3:54:05] club420: @sodapoppin didnt this happen last time where the servers were pretty empty after the first week of classic beta
[3:54:06] New_Game_Plus_o7: seems like they wanted a beta beta
[3:54:07] wardoo_: Tuna Pog
[3:54:07] joy_emoji_ok_hand: WAVE 2 ZULUL
[3:54:07] sheepexpert: prob in 2-3 weeka
[3:54:07] MoonEggHead: prob next reset
[3:54:08] mastercry1: around  west town
[3:54:09] JefffWithaG: What satanic ritual do I need to get a beta invite?
[3:54:10] embrs: streamers are just more important Kappa
[3:54:11] Esroth: it's called closed beta
[3:54:11] DuckGiner: they ran out of brass to smith beta keys
[3:54:12] Duelshock13: they want to keep it exclusive as possible so the hype increases
[3:54:14] nixonprime: @sodapoppin it was the same way in original classic beta. You have an opt in but they have selection bias on who gets in outside of stress tests. FeelsBadMan
[3:54:15] JesseDwf: happyRave
[3:54:15] striker10000: especially that addon development is more essential than advertising now
[3:54:16] Queenofw0lves: after wave 1 maybe FeelsDankMan
[3:54:17] Summersdonna: west
[3:54:19] ScottDark: They didn't invite more people because their servers can't handle it
[3:54:20] bob_beto: @sodapoppin its not only streamers, mcconnell got invited Kappa
[3:54:25] Fro_ftw85: they probably want to let streamera enjoy lvling before all the sniping spurges join.
[3:54:25] Drebinglock: Farm the firefly
[3:54:25] CorruptArkangel: sodaWICKED
[3:54:26] Rudywulf: @sodapoppin I'm happy with no invite to get to watch you not get stream sniped
[3:54:26] gfvaris: i swear these faking first beasts on deathbringer always come earlier then expected on warmane
[3:54:27] LinksmutisLt: @sodapoppin they dont have staff to deal with bug reports, they fired a lot of people LULW
[3:54:27] Juerrilla: the beta seems like it's in a rough state currently, barely running
[3:54:28] beaniex12: Why don’t they actually fcking advertise the game
[3:54:28] fnarf: u saw that guy earlier
[3:54:31] Summersdonna: ya

[3:54:35] CVB111: SHRUGGERS

[7:28:32] CrunkyBrewster: Twitch works like WWE does with their wrestling talent. they're contractors but technically they work for the company... just with no benefits. So when WWE terminates a talent, they just do it.

[7:28:48] loukangbang_: @sezyks Hmm Interesting point, but the site still profits from streamers, soooo..... kind of a gray area there
[7:28:49] PINP: Check arcadums twitter
[7:28:51] xiondisc: @ExperimentalDJz Yes, but that's why he's taking them to court. If they never told him, how does he know there even was a legit reason?

[7:29:11] VolkeB: Are you watching if he gets unbanned?
[7:29:13] loukangbang_: @sezyks Without streamers, there would be no site. Example - Mixer. LULW
[7:29:13] SrMontoya: is it going to get to court? why wouldnt twitch settle it outside court
[7:29:16] Wildcatz_20: chat fell asleep LUL
[7:29:19] rainemist: courtcase on who?
[7:29:20] ExperimentalDJz: @xiondisc Yes thats right, and so because they haev a reason.. what you said is not relevant.
[7:29:26] MisterWhatsittoya: only 1 level away PepeLaugh
[7:29:31] Ampitere: @expiredstreamer he said he probably would since all he can do now in TBC is level and do dungeons

[7:29:31] MisterWhatsittoya: 2 streams PepeLaugh

[7:29:34] xiondisc: @ExperimentalDJz What reason is that then?
[7:29:35] Splaschy: if he wins streamers actually have a precedent for them :o

[7:30:07] theblindon3: what profs you take?"

[7:33:27] Maria_Neefay: They've banned Doc, because Mixer no longer exists, so Twitch doesn't have competition to keep him away from the competition since there's none after Mixer went down. And that contract cost them money when there's no one to keep him from. A ban is a breach of a Twitch contract on the streamer part, hence they get to keep the money. It happened right after that Mixer thing was announced. That's why Doc is suing Twitch

[9:00:45] undaedpriest: @madmaxismee thats tough bro. All u can do is pick a class which aligns with ur personality. I like shadow priest because I can dps and heal but I'm not overly strong in any one area. You might like to be a rogue who specializes in full melee damage. Only thing u can do is play lol :)
