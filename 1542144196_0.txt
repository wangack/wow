[1:34:50] NewWorldReign: Has Chromatus been around in WoW itself or just in lore?
[1:34:59] Attackroot: wonder if hunters will get a tame  dragon book this xpac
[1:35:01] ggilgamech: @NewWorldReign yea but chromatus is higher threat and a really unique dragon

[1:36:12] Subjektive: yep
[1:36:15] poleon17: imtimidation is pet stun
[1:36:39] Subjektive: they should change that for MM just like a melee range stun or something
[1:36:49] KaisenSiru: Barrage Pog
[1:37:01] ggilgamech: @NewWorldReign a 5 headed one but yea
[1:37:32] DeanoTV: serpent sting Kreygasm
[1:37:33] mewkittymon: Yes pop trap in trash and good to go.
[1:37:44] RichardSnows76: remove those fogged crystal points if ur not using pet
[1:37:44] Subjektive: chakram is being changed to all damage done not just physical
[1:37:45] eakiller: lol shakrams
[1:38:04] eakiller: death shakrams
[1:38:06] XBazenTus: !music
[1:38:07] Nicoz971: Death chakram si way better
[1:38:10] onybear: Misdirect-barrage-feign death….isn’t that what hunters are supposed to do?
[1:38:11] Halrandei: I think death chak will always be better
[1:38:14] XBazenTus: !playlist
[1:38:25] akrus_warr: its not dmg buff, the main target jhust takes 100% more than the rest
[1:38:27] mewkittymon: Do it

[1:39:25] eakiller: we dont know if nessingwary is good
[1:39:26] Architank: The talents you don't have points in should remain gray while unavailable talents stay dark gray.
[1:39:29] XBazenTus: @newworldreign how to get listen then PokCharizard
[1:39:30] Deadelus0: As MM Serpent Sting isn't bad right?
[1:39:30] Halrandei: it's bad now, cos it's only freezing trap which isn't always usable on fights and it's kinda clunky now. Used to also be tar trap
[1:39:38] DeanoTV: im gonna go serpent poison with death chakram POGGERS
[1:39:45] NewWorldReign: @BeeReeF Youtube
[1:39:51] eakiller: thats moving to surv
[1:40:05] raye_gaming22: thats BM

[1:40:11] NewWorldReign: Click his Youtube link @BeeReeF
[1:40:14] Zilberg: Needs more abilities tbh
[1:40:22] woodnoteuniverse: MM probably the more difficult hunter spec
[1:40:31] looney199725: morning gang
[1:40:43] ashwing_: I mean technically you can take Stampede as MM you dont need a pet for that LUL
[1:40:51] raye_gaming22: i meant the 2 button sepc is bm ^^
[1:41:04] Gettinsouls: @Towelliee Hope you're doing well man, thanks for the early AM streams lately some good stuff to get my mind off of all the bullshit that's been going on recently where i'm at.

[1:42:15] Razmasbear: Morning, missed, anything?
[1:42:27] Murderingz: imo yes, marks weakness is 2 target
[1:42:33] looney199725: you need volley for aor
[1:42:35] looney199725: aoe
[1:42:46] Zilberg: Stacking up to 0 KEKW
[1:42:54] Ezekyler: above
[1:43:10] ggilgamech: above
[1:43:23] looney199725: below rapid fire
[1:43:27] EilauraTTV: @looney199725 you need multi shot and trickshot, volley is just nice to have
[1:43:47] Zilberg: Did they remove barrage?
[1:43:51] Subjektive: MM getting some big changes
[1:43:57] looney199725: double tap can be nice also for the burst
[1:43:58] Hansen_: SeemsGood
[1:43:59] ashwing_: bottom of the MM tree is hot garbage tbh too many choice nodes
[1:43:59] EilauraTTV: @Zilberg class tree not spec tree
[1:44:05] Gezber: @Subjektive it's in the left tree
[1:44:12] nothumbgamer_ttv: missiles?
[1:44:15] Zilberg: Oh me dumb EilauraTTV
[1:44:19] nothumbgamer_ttv: mulltiple bazookas?

[1:44:46] Pexaan: hello lovely people, hope everyone doing well <3
[1:44:53] looney199725: you can do big aoe dam with it too
[1:44:54] Tauren0309: yes
[1:45:02] Architank: Usually you double tap at the end of the fight Kappa
[1:45:13] Razmasbear: Waking up here, need some damn coffee
[1:45:29] Wolfenhoof: Next expansion, trees for hunter pets again please ScaredyCat
[1:45:46] Tauren0309: Steady is good
[1:46:07] Zilberg: Excited for the new build tomorrow sir?
[1:46:21] Texas_Mizfit: you get 0focus from rapid unless you take the talent
[1:46:22] falldrgn: Their choices for baseline abilities for classes  boggles me.  like why would Stormstrike not be baseline for enhance.. along with kill comand Or Beastial Wraith for BM..
[1:46:26] woodnoteuniverse: double tap rapid fire with trick shot is the most satisfying thing ever
[1:46:35] EilauraTTV: double tap aimed shot was good for aoe since there is currently a talent for 50% increased dmg on targets above 75% hp so it does hella dmg
[1:47:40] looney199725: thats op
[1:47:51] EilauraTTV: those 2 are just the legendaries for venthyr and necrolord
[1:47:54] Zilberg: Damn that's insane
[1:47:59] headshot_hunter6: explosive ricochet sounds OP1!!
[1:48:01] Zilberg: Imagine the AOE on that
[1:48:02] looney199725: light ammo isnt the expolsive ammo jesus
[1:48:29] jaqk088: Legacy of the windrunners?
[1:48:42] woodnoteuniverse: could probably get rid of volley tho for unerring vision
[1:48:59] Zilberg: Lone wolf meta
[1:49:05] headshot_hunter6: you still want a pet potentially just to summon and cast primal rage
[1:49:06] DeanoTV: MM with no lone wolf POGGERS this is awesome
[1:49:19] Fleymour: 1 more day for new alpha patch ? yyjPause blizz give talents
[1:49:20] DoodleNoodle: i roll my face on the keyboard
[1:49:35] Razmasbear: Is it the end of the world to take the "wrong" talent to experiment a bit?
[1:49:43] Zilberg: Paladin and warrior talent tree hopefully this week
[1:49:48] EilauraTTV: for aoe u always multishot then aimed shot/rapid fire multishot gives u trick shots for the ability to actually aoe, for single target aimed shot is prio then arcane shot, otherwise use regens
[1:49:53] Fleymour: blizz seems stunlocked with hunters naowhCringe
[1:49:54] mewkittymon: You might need a pet to lust .
[1:49:55] looney199725: more like warrior/amge
[1:49:57] looney199725: paladin isnt finished
[1:50:32] Zilberg: Warrior talent tree Kreygasm
[1:50:39] Fleymour: @looney199725 yeah warrior were even before shamans leaked.. but seemed not finished last week .. 🙏 tomorrow
[1:50:41] Subjektive: yes
[1:50:41] EilauraTTV: multishot gives u trick shots, trick shots allows aiemd shot and rapid fire to aoe
[1:50:42] IronPhalanX: yes
[1:50:55] TheBroCrow: Hello shadow Towelliee and chat
[1:50:56] looney199725: well nothing else is even finished
[1:51:03] looney199725: only 2 finished ones are mage/warrior
[1:51:08] boomerhands80: did you try survival yet?
[1:51:10] looney199725: paladin and rest all not done
[1:51:31] Razmasbear: My biggest fear on tomorrows build is that druids get screwed even more if that is even possible
[1:51:42] looney199725: whats wrong with druids/
[1:51:59] Razmasbear: everything..... poor bears :(
[1:52:00] Texas_Mizfit: you will never cast serpent sting
[1:52:26] looney199725: trickshot is your big dps cd
[1:52:32] DeanoTV: @Texas_Mizfit I will :) love it
[1:52:33] Murderingz: volley can give trick shots on 2 targets
[1:52:38] EilauraTTV: @looney199725 no its not
[1:52:43] Razmasbear: balance NEEDS some burst aoe, allowing starfall to stack wold do that easiest way but nooooo.....
[1:52:47] looney199725: lmao 30k crit
[1:52:51] looney199725: that hits pretty hard
[1:52:53] DeanoTV: MM with serpent sting poisons and no lone wolf Kreygasm

[1:54:44] DoodleNoodle: Chat, are warlock talents out yet?

[1:54:47] Zilberg: This does seem like a whole lotta buttons lmao
[1:55:41] MaleFrom73: you might have more abilities than you need. Not enough gcd's to hit them all
[1:55:49] NEMERL: Classic community is really toxic fro everyone who plays retail
[1:55:51] EilauraTTV: if u true shot/double tap before the volley u pop it off faster and way harder
[1:55:54] Kasvot_Vaxt: theres too many buttons in SL IMO
[1:55:58] yuvalal: @DoodleNoodle not yet, hoping tomorrow
[1:56:02] DeanoTV: Kreygasm
[1:56:07] looney199725: try double tap with wailing arrow
[1:56:15] DoodleNoodle: @DoodleNoodle cool

[2:04:55] raye_gaming22: 12 more weeks of suffering
[2:04:57] Murderingz: @Texas_Mizfit theyre gonna bake that in the next build
[2:05:01] Zilberg: Blizzard letting us have fun? No shot
[2:05:28] JamesMusicus: the focus is built into rapid fire now i think
[2:05:39] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Towelliee under misdirect on main talent purple things, are for your pet, are you not using one?
[2:06:21] Creaxie: rapid fire generates 1 focus per shot, always has as far as i remember
[2:06:59] JamesMusicus: I think they may have forgotten to put rapid fire rank 2 back into the spell if it's not generating focus
[2:07:21] Gezber: EZ
[2:07:47] Therapy_Kittenz: Is there a sign up page for the alpha? or do you just randomly get the invite?

[2:12:02] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:12:07] Ziddrax: Kappa
[2:12:11] malkezadec: i am only giving you a hard time lol
[2:12:11] Phoenixfiend: streamer perks op
[2:12:36] Disgruntledd: I’ve always been curious if beta invites are automated, or is someone sifting through peoples stuff?
[2:13:00] ggilgamech: oh god
[2:13:09] ggilgamech: thrallmar music
[2:13:20] Evilbreed83: does rapid fire automatically bounce to other targets?
[2:13:21] Warjun11: to bad that there is no aspect of sheetah anymore
[2:13:36] hikaritd: I preordered Legion, got beta, didnt have BfA, no beta, not played SL since 2021 January, wonder if I get DF beta Kappa
[2:13:39] EilauraTTV: @Evilbreed83 only if u have trick shot active which is from multi shot or volley
[2:13:48] EilauraTTV: @Warjun11 there is, bottom of his bar
[2:14:10] Jewishraver: @Towelliee good morning sir, how are you today?
[2:14:11] Warjun11: yeah but not the oldshool one where it was group wide
[2:14:13] Ety_TV: when will alfa be beta? How long will be the alpha period?
[2:14:14] ZakuzaGB: i wish there was a way to build up some kind of rep for beta testing so you are more likley to get it, id love to test stuff more
[2:14:17] dirtydeus: What’s ur opinion on people hating on preach for getting Alpha? If you have any

[2:14:31] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:14:32] woodnoteuniverse: Do you think people would get beta access even if they arent subbed?
[2:14:38] fosko777: so they can test multiple graphic cards and stuff
[2:14:42] ShadyWire: i just had the worst group in a normal dungeon
[2:14:46] falldrgn: but there are outliers, I have friends that havent played in years get access to the WOTLK beta
[2:14:50] Evilbreed83: so would you use double tap after using muilti shot and rapid fire or is rapid fire a focus builder that you use at the end of a rotation?
[2:14:58] ShadyWire: retail
[2:14:59] falldrgn: Or expansion betas
[2:15:06] Zilberg: Lol why would they give Beta access to non subs that seems kind of .. dumb
[2:15:11] KaisenSiru: I've gotten every Beta since Cata. Helps when I've been in a top 7-15 guild each expansion for them
[2:15:18] woodnoteuniverse: Im hoping blizz gives me access so that they think it'll make me resub
[2:15:21] LoNg_LiVe_RoLLs: Last beta invite I got was BC and I've put thousands of hours into this game since. I'm just not lucky :(
[2:15:26] Stormrazer78: You like gameplay on alpha?
[2:15:27] EilauraTTV: @Evilbreed83 its a focus builder but many people use it as an opener too since its pretty decent dmg on its own, but u can use double tap earlier than multi like pre fight
[2:15:44] Attackroot: same as top guilds
[2:15:56] Evilbreed83: @EilauraTTV  gotcha
[2:16:00] Jack_the_Dipper: Then they must be mistyping my name every time LUL

[2:16:48] geokouts: i have a dot matrix fax machine with dial-up 24k, does it count?
[2:16:53] Opih_2k: healer have probably signed as healer AND DPS
[2:16:58] Kasvot_Vaxt: did they change player stats at all?
[2:17:06] Texas_Mizfit: did the healer select heal role
[2:17:17] Inthezonewow: 11.0 Alpha invite for sure towCopium
[2:17:35] Carlenzo: just give me the character creator for the dragon race and ill be fine with having no beta acces tbf
[2:17:49] Razmasbear: wait wait, was that TAUREN ROGUE?!!!

[2:18:11] EilauraTTV: @Razmasbear yes it seems

[2:18:54] Crowargus: swear i only got into last beta cause i had rtx which was fairly new at the time\
[2:19:01] EilauraTTV: @Jewishraver hes mm, bonus dmg for no pet
[2:19:10] akia03: only outsideof trueshot
[2:19:11] Razmasbear: I like those new castbars
[2:19:17] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee ye if u can afford it and u dont have aimed shot up
[2:19:31] ashwing_: steady shot to get focus
[2:19:50] yoitsloid: A shame they updated them and did not input casting times and latency... Should be in tbh
[2:20:06] Razmasbear: For me with vision imparment, things can sometimes just be"whati'm not seeing it?!!"
[2:20:08] Clicklesly: I'm not a fan of your own castbar to only be at the bottom of the screen though, but that should be moveable eventually
[2:20:15] Cornilya: what's the color of the new class/race going to be?
[2:20:15] Gezber: ofc
[2:20:20] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee yes, its heavy use
[2:20:24] ashwing_: yep and rapid fire
[2:20:28] akia03: only mm relly
[2:20:45] Texas_Mizfit: steady shot twice in arow for haste

[2:20:52] akia03: did youspec ito rapid fire regen?
[2:20:54] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[2:21:03] naahjlydaime: Do you know if they implemented fleshcraft in some talent trees? :)
[2:21:11] Jarlan23: is it best to use a pet with mm in shadowlands
[2:21:17] Jarlan23: bc i like mm but i hate using a pet
[2:21:25] EilauraTTV: @naahjlydaime so far they havent put any of the utility covenant abilities in
[2:21:28] Jarlan23: i mean dragonflight
[2:21:29] Razmasbear: Shamans get Primordial wave..... we wanted CHAIN HARVEST!!!
[2:21:33] lumjicsgo: @KaisenSiru u are world 1000 relax
[2:21:37] naahjlydaime: ok thanks :)
[2:21:37] ashwing_: @Jarlan23 Not really only if you need it to tank
[2:21:39] Crowargus: right there lol
[2:21:40] JellonaCub: Left choice node i think
[2:21:41] LearnedSomething: I just got a random ZM trash drop boe that's worth 250k gold
[2:21:42] akia03: or did they change the ree
[2:21:44] Imoom: Have/Will you get alpha/beta keys to give out?
[2:21:45] JamesMusicus: @Towelliee They removed rapid fire focus regen when they updated the tree, but they don't seem to have rolled it into the base ability
[2:21:45] Crowargus: lol na jk
[2:21:49] EilauraTTV: @Jarlan23 no, u get 10% increased dmg for not having a pet
[2:21:59] Picklz: they changed the trees its baked in now
[2:22:00] Gezber: @Razmasbear i wanted none of the covenant abilities LuL
[2:22:08] Rottencoarse: far left choice node @Towelliee
[2:22:22] JellonaCub: The first one with blue / yellow and choose aim shot reduces rapid fire cooldown if im not mistaken
[2:22:24] JamesMusicus: guys they changed the tree it's not on that choice node anymore
[2:22:24] Razmasbear: Druids get convoke in every tree
[2:22:25] Rottencoarse: after the streamline
[2:22:33] 3dobbee: how is alpha
[2:22:45] Texas_Mizfit: can you freeze trap giants
[2:22:49] LearnedSomething: oh I can see why it's worth that much, this sword looks sick
[2:22:54] Evilbreed83: the mm tree the rapid fire node says it generates 1 focus each shot
[2:22:55] EilauraTTV: @Razmasbear and some get necro swarm thing
[2:23:00] Gostaw: how much haste do you have?
[2:23:04] SC0REGASMS: is this a world first no evoker run??  lol
[2:23:05] Toasti0: hand picked for alpha to be an unpaid tester. I'll be enjoying the game with friends and finished content.
[2:23:06] Blazzerx: HAMMERS UP
[2:23:06] Kasvot_Vaxt: are secondary stats still percentage based
[2:23:20] akia03: they changed the tree
[2:23:24] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it's the second one
[2:23:25] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee it was changed
[2:23:26] Razmasbear: ferals and resto what looked get adaptive swarm...
[2:23:43] looney199725: they are comparing changes
[2:23:50] Creaxie: Try hovering over rapid fire - does it not just say regenerates 1 focus per shot?
[2:23:56] Gezber: rogue is a real ninja...
[2:24:01] Evilbreed83: tauren rogue pulled LUL
[2:24:11] Evilbreed83: ass to fat
[2:24:15] EilauraTTV: tauren rogue, real stealthy imo
[2:24:23] EilauraTTV: def capable of invisibility
[2:24:33] ChuckyG0: still no music ingame/
[2:24:44] Gezber: KEKW
[2:24:58] odysseus1: can't see him KEKW
[2:24:58] Blazzerx: I like the new cast bar of mobs. makes it more easily interruptable
[2:25:09] Kasvot_Vaxt: sneaky cow
[2:25:10] Jokervenom1978: Tauren rogue so stealthy you cant see him.
[2:25:12] Zilberg: Is that John Cena?
[2:25:20] Razmasbear: Yea it's massive improvement
[2:25:25] Razmasbear: like it aswell
[2:25:29] Wolfenhoof: @Evilbreed83 They envy of the dwarven races. Our grace is as sharp as our horns.
[2:25:39] Jewishraver: we get cow ninjas before murlocs come on!
[2:25:57] Razmasbear: tauren mages aswell....
[2:26:19] Jewishraver: crouching tiger hidden beef
[2:26:20] Wolfenhoof: Mooges, finally.
[2:26:30] TheBeardedChief: hes still getting his lone wolf buff even with a pet out?
[2:26:31] Rudric_Ice: why are people so mad about taurens getting rogues ? KEKW
[2:26:32] akia03: do taurens still have the increased melee range?
[2:26:38] TheBeardedChief: nvm
[2:26:46] racos: hello sir is this the neltharus dungeon?
[2:26:47] KaisenSiru: I like Survival the most
[2:26:48] Blazzerx: I prefer MM
[2:26:49] LoNg_LiVe_RoLLs: It's a real hunter
[2:26:51] Wolfenhoof: @akia03 not since late BC if i remember right
[2:26:53] Razmasbear: its not that we are mad, we are bit amused
[2:26:56] Evilbreed83: i play bm. it's auto pilot tbh
[2:26:59] jeflag: its more straightforward
[2:27:00] szble: SOUNDS LIKE HUNTER
[2:27:03] Zilberg: MM is fun but exotic pets are cool
[2:27:03] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[2:27:04] Aquadriel: thats why is a raid leader specc
[2:27:14] Alepouditsa: yep i love BM but i like druid bear
[2:27:26] BfAleTitan: it does decent damage and lets me focus on fight mechanics
[2:27:34] OviTheGray: call the jungle. job done
[2:27:35] Gezber: keep stacks of barbed shot and win EZ
[2:27:37] scumlucki: i love the lava effects that im seeing
[2:27:42] Razmasbear: Guardian tank last 16 years so.... dabbling in holy priest and resto shaman occasionally
[2:27:44] specialkidmiles: guzuNerd excuse me where are the dmg meters
[2:27:47] HealthyGorilla: Will Guardian druid be any good the new expansion @Towelliee >
[2:27:47] ShakyShade: how u feel
[2:27:47] annern93: Yeah im a bm and i enjoy that much more then  the other specs
[2:28:04] Jewishraver: are we dealing with a bunch of elementals in these runs?
[2:28:06] botscast: are u even a hunter if u dont have a pet
[2:28:08] Rudric_Ice: so did they just steal Wailing arrow from Hots ?
[2:28:11] Antdavs24: For me it’s spec that feels the most like a hunter plus exotic pets lol
[2:28:21] Wolfenhoof: @Zilberg I use Gara since she was aviable in WoD. Can't leave the poor thing alone, so BM forever.
[2:28:28] volkreig: What class talents is it going to be on the new patch? @Towelliee
[2:28:32] Razmasbear: isn't wailing arrow the sylvanas legendary bow ability?
[2:28:34] sselesu: Bm shoould always be last in dps logs, its easiest/more mobile/ranged spec
[2:28:35] EilauraTTV: @Rudric_Ice it was an ability from a legendary bow dropped from sylvanus in the last raid, so if they stole it, it was back then
[2:28:35] Kasvot_Vaxt: tbh i hope they balance the game so you dont need a PhD in mathematics to understand what is happening with your dps
[2:28:45] akia03: did they fix animal companion?
[2:28:53] Thoreya: ^ really not that hard to understand
[2:29:17] Cyony: i mean, thats kind of a flawed argument, we are in alpha. balance is going to be whack. If you are able to keep up with a bunch of other specs while not playing correctly and not having the right stuff up, it should get tuned down.
[2:29:18] scumlucki: @Kasvot_Vaxt i hope so too
[2:29:33] EilauraTTV: @Kasvot_Vaxt what kind of phd do u need? i understand it fine and im a dropout
[2:29:35] Rudric_Ice: so does wailing arrow silence too ?
[2:29:36] JayBron_Lames: guys. i'm new.  this the Hunter class, no?
[2:29:37] Razmasbear: Need my coffee, it's 14:14 here and i' exhausted
[2:29:40] Cyony: Or the people you are playing with are equally or worse at playing their respective specs
[2:29:51] Clicklesly: @Rudric_Ice Wait until you see The Lost Dwarves encounter Kappa
[2:29:52] EilauraTTV: @Assault_Dadddy it is
[2:30:00] ShakyShade: yes, it is hunter, only one that can use bow&gun
[2:30:16] EilauraTTV: Legion mm was so fucking fun
[2:30:17] Razmasbear: BM cabn aswell?
[2:30:17] Thoreya: i was told wow rotations are easy af. now we need a phd to understand
[2:30:24] JayBron_Lames: ty
[2:30:26] ShakyShade: I like marksman, cuz it is so stright forward
[2:30:32] ZakuzaGB: Marksman gives the proper Archer feeling which can be nice
[2:30:33] net_mi: MoP mm was the most fun
[2:30:43] EilauraTTV: @Thoreya theyre not easy but theyre not hard
[2:30:45] JamesMusicus: wow rotations are easy tbh
[2:30:52] Razmasbear: Legion guardian druid, oh man i loved that
[2:30:53] EilauraTTV: @net_mi i was so broken, chimera go brt
[2:30:55] foofighters182: tame octo-elephant
[2:31:00] Heavuh: Hunter hasnt been fun since mop
[2:31:13] odysseus1: let's be honest, most of us will just do whatever icy veins says
[2:31:14] Rudric_Ice: u don't need phd u just need WA
[2:31:19] Razmasbear: I wonder if you CAN tame that boss
[2:31:20] silodin: @foofighters182 ^do this! tame it!
[2:31:20] kanino0: procs KEKW
[2:31:23] EilauraTTV: @Heavuh hunter main since mop, disagree
[2:31:33] Kronvig78: is it a problem if something is easy?
[2:31:45] Creaxie: WoD MM was the golden age of MM
[2:31:49] scumlucki: been leveling a priest fun class
[2:31:49] ziphertv: This boss Looks cool
[2:31:49] EilauraTTV: @Razmasbear not that one specifically since its lvl 72, have to be equal level or higher to tame but there are similar models to tame
[2:31:55] SirnCG: is steady shot is necessary to use when u have rapid fire and death shacram?
[2:31:56] JaymurZ: Survival hunter was pretty fun in legion
[2:31:56] zarenadt: Alpha is kinda dull without any of the new zones open
[2:32:00] Kasvot_Vaxt: @Rudric_Ice ya but like dont you see why that is a problem with the game
[2:32:12] Gezber: catJAM
[2:32:14] Clicklesly: Should be new zones tomorrow ^^
[2:32:18] EilauraTTV: @SirnCG yes, steady shot is only non cd generator, rapid fire is 7 second cd i believe
[2:32:19] Razmasbear: damn.....
[2:32:19] silodin: what is this music?! :O
[2:32:19] Zilberg: The mount to farm this expansion is this big boy right here @Towelliee
[2:32:35] ZakuzaGB: you mainly wanna use arcane shot procs or use as filler/on the move
[2:32:36] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee like 40yrds depending on ur mastery
[2:32:40] silodin: ooh is this the music from the band cave on darkmoon isle?
[2:32:48] szble: waking shores
[2:32:56] Razmasbear: I still think that mythic this boss drops the mount, let a bear dream...
[2:32:56] b3ardedpaduh: Are covenants skills going to be usable in Dragon Flight
[2:33:01] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee W thinking
[2:33:10] scumlucki: i hope that magma tusk becomes a mount
[2:33:10] Rudric_Ice: @Rudric_Ice i do thats why i want blizz to ban WA and combat addons but its just a fever dream
[2:33:12] EilauraTTV: @Beardrezz certain ones are being put into talent trees but not all
[2:33:22] EilauraTTV: @STK_Lucki it is
[2:33:24] angerfist_1993: are there any other dungeons except for this and uldaman already ? or only these 2 ?
[2:33:45] scumlucki: @EilauraTTV you have no idea how happythat makes me
[2:34:02] Rudric_Ice: what we getting in the next phase ?
[2:34:13] Doog45: you're confused...I'm fucking confused

[2:35:06] Gezber: @Towelliee where is the new Uldaman?
[2:35:13] yuvalal: i hope for locks
[2:35:16] Razmasbear: next to old uldaman
[2:35:17] Jewishraver: how many duegons will there be for DOF?
[2:35:21] Zilberg: Which area are you hoping for this week? @Towelliee ?
[2:35:25] net_mi: When do you think we'll enter beta?
[2:35:26] Scraggersmeh: @Jewishraver They said 8.
[2:35:27] NotYetRatedd: do you think they'll release more dungeons with next build?
[2:35:47] Thoreya: mage talent trees today or tomorrow towCopium towCopium
[2:35:48] spiceyholo: there will be 8 dung. but only 4 open at the start.
[2:35:48] Rudric_Ice: hopefully we get warrior and pally talents next build
[2:35:52] Thoreya: please bliz

[2:35:58] chillmodez: lava on floor, on sanguie weeks...
[2:36:01] Razmasbear: seems so
[2:36:05] mavericks312: let's hope we get pally and mage talents
[2:36:11] Razmasbear: its above the old uldman entrance
[2:36:16] sinlesssinner: he knows guys
[2:36:19] Nachozdood: Morning @Towelliee shocked im awake was out super late at a concert lastnight
[2:36:21] NotYetRatedd: max said he knew which talents we're going to get already, i envy him
[2:36:25] silodin: T'was satire, because of what MMO-C always claim ;)
[2:36:29] Zilberg: He's a knower monkaS
[2:36:33] scumlucki: i swear warrior talents are gonna be last
[2:36:38] NVbrutal: still waiting for them warrior talents to release.
[2:36:41] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee yes
[2:36:49] Scraggersmeh: Only when hitting 3+ targets @Towelliee
[2:36:56] Secondbreakfasttt: double
[2:36:56] Scraggersmeh: Double cleaves, yes.
[2:36:58] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee Yes
[2:37:14] stinkyravenbri: yeah this spec is pretty straight foward
[2:37:18] stinkyravenbri: nothing fancy to it
[2:37:22] maidenhaur: prot warr talents probably hard to balance since its what made them so good
[2:37:26] Zilberg: Is it meant to double cleave?
[2:37:27] Secondbreakfasttt: and rapid fire also double cleave
[2:37:31] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee the typical aoe rotation is double tap, chakrams, volley, aimed rapid fire
[2:37:34] Scraggersmeh: @Zilberg Yes.
[2:37:39] EilauraTTV: well, burst opener
[2:37:48] mukulukku: are these side walking animations while aiming new?

[2:57:14] NVbrutal: think regular chakrims  should be removed for another talent feel like there wont ever be a reason to pick it over death chakrims.
[2:57:18] Razmasbear: Towelliee healing.... where do I sign up for THAT?!!
[2:57:40] Rudric_Ice: healers are just simps basically who wants to play as simps am i right ? KEKW
[2:57:42] EilauraTTV: @NVbrutal only people who dont care about their dmg will pick it, death chakrams are so much better fs

[2:57:59] EilauraTTV: @Towelliee its pretty good but niche utility, it does aoe silence which is nice
[2:58:02] rhsiuol: the silence is big
[2:58:03] Naamverloren: On BM its just a cast bar where all other spells are non casts
[2:58:08] botscast: people dont like it because it has a cast time i think, atleast thats the reason i dont like it
[2:58:13] looney199725: its good utility for sure
[2:58:15] theoriginalzinng: im kinda excited to see what they do with prot war

[2:58:37] rhsiuol: from the leaks they are making prot warr do bleeds
[2:58:40] JamesMusicus: bc hunters hate not being able to move
[2:58:40] EilauraTTV: @JamesMusicus no
[2:58:54] looney199725: thunderclap spreads rend
[2:58:59] SC0REGASMS: are DL dungeons heavy magic or more physical?  that could help them maybe
[2:59:00] EilauraTTV: @JamesMusicus MM has sadly been unable to move since legion :/

[2:59:21] looney199725: the shield wall going to all party is a huge deal
[2:59:22] NVbrutal: the ignore pain cd reduced to 1sec is huge imo going back to how it was in legion.
[2:59:25] Rudric_Ice: blizz killed Hots for Wailing arrow Kappa

[2:59:51] Alvari: do the new phases add on top of the earlier phases?
[3:00:03] EilauraTTV: @JamesMusicus the bis leggy in legion was to allow mm to move all the time, and they brought it back for SL but its so useless compared to the other leggies sadge

[3:11:26] cabalish: no blizz, sony or nintendo at gamescom this year
[3:11:47] duman_2020: so evokers are top dps for now in ALPHA?
[3:11:50] Rudric_Ice: they only slap in AOE
[3:12:02] scumlucki: @duman_2020 new class prolly gonna be top dps at launch too
[3:12:05] sperg0verlord: i cant wait for evoker pvp
[3:12:10] DoubleNova: are preservation healers overtuned?

[3:12:52] Rudric_Ice: evokers r not OP like DK and DH was
[3:13:03] duman_2020: I really don't like that, it's like it's made un purpose to only nerf it later...
[3:13:33] Ragevamp666: ahh so is it a complete reuse of uldaman? or are there new area's here?
[3:13:36] scumlucki: all that lava
[3:13:39] EilauraTTV: @duman_2020 theyre usually completely new spell and types like lots of the evokers new abilities are brand new styles of combat so its just hard to balance till they get a shit ton of data like rfom an actual launch
[3:13:47] schmooplesthesecond: that was quick

[3:20:54] Molvonos: @91Niki towSip towSip towSip
[3:20:59] shaxxtv: only tier set
[3:21:06] schmooplesthesecond: @Towelliee are you logging this run?
[3:21:09] DudeInARobe: Talents, Legendaries, Tier Sets. That’s enough lol
[3:21:11] rainbow_egg: They way your class plays when the expansion launches will be how you play it till next expac
[3:21:13] Se7enthSinn: thank god for that
[3:21:18] Gargantix: and crafted gear
[3:21:20] Billo0w: for real? i thought there is going to be an expansion system
[3:21:28] EilauraTTV: @rainbow_egg not always lol
[3:21:37] im_capy: poping a flask will be our borrowed power again
[3:21:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: somebody at my work just spent at least 30 minutes in the bathroom, now i am afraid to walk down the hall
[3:21:59] 91Niki: So which classes are we missing with new talents in the alpha?
[3:22:05] Rudric_Ice: new uldaman doesn't have that much trash compared to blizz's new takes on dungeons
[3:22:14] Thoriakk: which hunter spec is it ?
[3:22:15] DudeInARobe: Crafted gear is going to come at such a high premium on the AH lol gonna be like buying runecarving gear at the start of patches
[3:22:15] maskedboy999: @rainbow_egg  mhhh thats never happened
[3:22:23] Razmasbear: warrior warlock monk mage dh...
[3:22:28] subversv: monks warriors warlocks mage dh
[3:22:36] im_capy: pally talents this week please blizz
[3:22:40] Razmasbear: paladins
[3:22:43] subversv: oh yeah and pally
[3:22:47] duman_2020: @NVNTO Yeah, you might be right. I've been playing this game since 2004 (with a lot of breaks), but I think after so many years it starts to wear off...
[3:22:51] Jaren475: is there a minimum level you need to reach to get that game wide 50% exp boost?
[3:22:51] rainbow_egg: @maskedboy999 That's cause we've had borrowed power, but we don't anymore come DF
[3:22:53] subversv: but who cares about pallies Kappa
[3:22:58] scumlucki: if wow had a class that can dual wield pistols id main it100 percent
[3:23:17] Zombahb: So any thoughts when beta will be? Pretty eager to try warlock out. Really hoping DD reignites in my interest, but based on what I've been watching here it seems pretty cool
[3:23:23] matching_towels: Maybe the legendaries will have a bit more focus on introducing new playstyles. Playing the same from start of xpac till end is…. A bit static
[3:23:30] Rudric_Ice: GILNEAS THEME Kreygasm I LOST
[3:23:39] Zombahb: Sorry sure that's been asked several hundred times lol
[3:24:00] matching_towels: And tier sets ofc.
[3:24:00] 91Niki: @subversv Thanks!
[3:24:07] Unitsven: u tried survival yet?
[3:24:11] 91Niki: I can
[3:24:15] 91Niki: I can't wait to see monks
[3:24:24] subversv: monk is gonna be so fun i bet
[3:24:26] robert_332: you got a belt lol
[3:24:36] Razmasbear: hope we get monks in tomorrow
[3:24:45] subversv: uldaman is gonna be a nightmare on M+ sanguine lol
[3:24:55] nvnto: @Towelliee do you still get reset points after killing a boss, or do you need to use the wormholes?
[3:25:04] scumlucki: as a warrior main i take pride in pressing only 4 buttons to do amage
[3:25:19] Billo0w: im so happy rn because there wont be an expansion system lol, that was the one thing i was waiting for in t his alpha to see if i buy DF or not now ill probably buy it
[3:25:26] EilauraTTV: @NVNTO what are u talking about? O.o
[3:25:49] scumlucki: whole lotta raging blow spam and execute with a little bladestorm mixed in
[3:25:55] subversv: he meant check points after killing a boss i think
[3:26:08] gfield2k: So a lot of the classic dungeons is apart of the Dragon flight expansion @Towelliee?
[3:26:27] Razmasbear: just additional wing in uldaman
[3:26:33] EilauraTTV: @gfield2k think its just this one
[3:26:33] scumlucki: @Billo0w new proffesion system is the new borrowed power scumPYSCHO scumPYSCHO
[3:26:36] Razmasbear: its NOT replacing original
[3:26:42] nvnto: @EilauraTTV talking about check points in dungeons so u dont have to run back after a death all the way from the start of a dungeon.
[3:26:52] EilauraTTV: @NVNTO ah
[3:27:07] 91Niki: And here I was really thinking we would get a Jack Ryan season 3 trailer at SDCC. I really wonder what tf happened. Something must have gone wrong internally seeing we haven't heard anything yet
[3:27:12] Rudric_Ice: so are we getting any more dungeon remakes or this is the only one ?
[3:27:15] gfield2k: @EilauraTTV Ahh okay cool

[3:30:46] Nachozdood: Evoker has to be broken its new and blizz needs asses in seats
[3:30:52] Pexaan: and 80% of the player base gonna be evoker prob LUL
[3:30:54] subversv: looks like unholy is about the same
[3:31:00] KaisenSiru: monkaW
[3:31:01] szble: yeah scarlet adaptation
[3:31:05] MOXP: balanced LUL
[3:31:11] DudeInARobe: They don’t have enough tanks out to compare Bear to, to nerf them lol
[3:31:15] OviTheGray: might have the broken items on
[3:31:19] DoubleNova: they gotta sell that expansion with the new shiny class
[3:31:27] Rudric_Ice: this is alpha tho so high chance it might get nerfed before launch
[3:31:29] Gezber: EZ
[3:31:40] geokouts: nerf inc!
[3:31:45] Tamz_tv: I think the idea is that everything is supposed to feel broken
[3:31:45] matching_towels: Did they do anything to bear to make the playstyle more engaging?
[3:31:50] duman_2020: Damn...
[3:31:54] Pexaan: new meta, 4 evoker healers M+ both healing and dpsiing

[3:32:30] looney199725: what if evoker isnt broken everything else is undertuned
[3:32:36] looney199725: cuz we doing like 20k overall rn on live
[3:32:37] MOXP: surely evoker won't be broken on release Kappa
[3:32:42] Razmasbear: 3 evoker dps + evoker heal + dk tank....
[3:32:42] szble: inb4 mage tears
[3:32:44] looney199725: it makes no sense to be doing 8k overall
[3:32:51] looney199725: i think  alot o classes just undertuned
[3:32:52] DoubleNova: is preservation hots or instant?
[3:32:58] scumlucki: imagine having evoker tank specand just having just a whole group or raid of evoker
[3:33:03] poruchiik: Yeah but what else? I heard you could make a Tauren Rogue

[3:33:33] rainbow_egg: @STK_Lucki You can already do that with Druid and Paladin
[3:33:34] im_capy: numbers dont always have to be bigger each expansion, its how we end up with big stat squishes
[3:33:39] Tamz_tv: Tauren could always be rogues, they were just too good nobody noticed
[3:33:40] poruchiik: Night Elf Paladin?
[3:33:56] Manabucho: aoe or single target?
[3:33:57] scumlucki: @rainbow_egg yeah i guess
[3:33:58] OviTheGray: did they fix the broken 5k stat items? they might have one equiped

[3:35:13] Architank: because we are used to being punished
[3:35:13] szble: i mean anything too meta gets nerfed
[3:35:14] naahjlydaime: cuz people are bitter
[3:35:14] potposky: doomers
[3:35:16] Nachozdood: zero numbers passes so far right?
[3:35:17] Wcvechten: because it's like week 2 of the alpha, probably
[3:35:19] NickLeonhearth: if its not their class.... its getting nerfed
[3:35:19] binkz77: anything fun in wow equals nerf
[3:35:29] Shaele: Warning! Fun Found! Prepare the Nerf Hammer!
[3:35:31] FadeXbp: warlocks are top dps in every single expansion
[3:35:38] jasonbriggs: nerf it and rurf it
[3:35:38] Pexaan: because I want the focus to go on other classes so they don't nerf my ele shaman to the ground

[3:35:41] looney199725: @im_capy it wont rly be nerfed much the hp has to go up anyways its how every expac goes
[3:35:43] paravak: Veng DH was broken throughout the whole of legion beta, by release day it was nerfed through the ground
[3:35:46] ShadoodHD: cause we like to see the nerf bat in the works PopCorn towSip
[3:35:57] AveragePvp: @nickleonhearth and if it is their class it’s not “that broken”
[3:35:59] matching_towels: They should just have a meta calendar that they rotate per patch, so everyone knows and gets a turn LUL
[3:36:12] AveragePvp: @nickleonhearth always the same song haha
[3:36:12] thebakeriscomingforu: Rotations and talents will be adjusted now, numbers later on.
[3:36:12] DudeInARobe: Curious how they handle nerfs. In recent years it’s been nerfs to borrowed power abilities tied to talents. Now, we have an issue of totally ruining the entire class if they nerf talents to the ground.
[3:36:17] 91Niki: Me, myself and I sacBLANKIES
[3:36:22] Pexaan: true
[3:36:40] BunnyMountain: i want BM's time in the sun give this to me blizzard :D
[3:36:41] ShadoodHD: or better yet, do a weekly rotation on what is nerfed and what is buffed for fun KEKW
[3:36:42] Lightasaurus: I ONLY RP MY CLASS, PLS NERF
[3:36:43] Fugazi811: is the class fun should be the question, tuning comes later
[3:36:48] OviTheGray: nerf or boost, less work :)
[3:36:49] looney199725: meta slave or be forgotten haha
[3:36:51] Crisis88: Probably because no class should be 25% higher then the next best class
[3:36:51] Ishva: Im all about buffing to even with that OP class :)
[3:36:52] Pexaan: very true, nerf everything except elemental shaman
[3:37:03] jasonbriggs: people who say nerf it prob dont know how to play that class lol
[3:37:04] dimofodi: Ret paladin would like a word :D
[3:37:11] 91Niki: Yeah, there is no world where all classes are equally balanced
[3:37:13] Funderik: what is your guess on p3 alpha content wise?
[3:37:16] FresheFefe: a tauren rogue KEKWlaugh
[3:37:19] 91Niki: That's a fantasy
[3:37:23] scumlucki: wheres the dual pistole class
[3:37:27] looney199725: no class will ever be balanced
[3:37:29] ShadoodHD: sounds like we need more theorycrafting Kappa
[3:37:30] Noshpan: Buff everything, including Shaman!
[3:37:34] rbailey_2222: rbailey_2222 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[3:37:35] Shamwise: As a filthy casual, I dont give a ratts ass either way:)
[3:37:35] szble: yeah but there shouldnt be extreme outliers
[3:37:37] looney199725: get used to it
[3:37:45] Architank: being a fury warrior at the start of shadowlands was rough. they evening buffed the spec with 15% increase in damage 5% at a time but at that point it was too late
[3:38:00] drgempmike: I don't think rogue tree changed.
[3:38:03] Architank: eventually* buffed
[3:38:20] 91Niki: Oh yeah, the devs basically made it harder for themselves in terms of balancing
[3:38:23] looney199725: i mean look at specs that have 5-6 ccs
[3:38:27] looney199725: good luck balancing that
[3:38:31] 91Niki: with this talent tree
[3:38:33] Funderik: still not as much worth as 5 systems on top of talents etc, i think they got this ez.
[3:38:35] szble: warlocks praying for meta
[3:38:46] ElDrakenMan: @towelliee when was the last time you were able to main a pali for raids?
[3:38:52] Funderik: work*
[3:39:19] mavros_kyrios: mavros_kyrios subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[3:39:34] ShadoodHD: would an ESO-like class/spell system work for wow? like limiting classes but add optional spells like mage guild etc
[3:40:00] JamesMusicus: Idk if you have enough points for it  but I think there's a funny outlaw build where pistols proc ambushes which proc more pistols
[3:40:18] looney199725: no one wants eso or FF combat in wow
[3:40:27] Thoreya: ^
[3:40:32] looney199725: those combat system wont work in wow
[3:40:43] d0nkles: ESO combat is why I don't play it
[3:40:52] apollobaker: wait, you can be a tauren rogue?
[3:41:03] scumlucki: eso combat is bunz
[3:41:03] xRaZoNx: yes
[3:41:06] fleet21_: WoW combat has ruined all other MMOs for me
[3:41:21] Tryhardion: tbh wow combat has the best combat system of all mmos because how it is reactive
[3:41:27] binkz77: is noone playing palidan on alpha is that why we haven't seen a palidan tree
[3:41:30] Alienfromger: imagine bdo combat style in wow
[3:41:32] JamesMusicus: @Towelliee Oh on wowhead it says the ambush talents aren't implemented
[3:41:36] fleet21_: its sooo fluid
[3:41:44] Dinermoe: 5
[3:41:46] scumlucki: @binkz77 its because there isnt a paladin tree
[3:41:50] Deadelus0: @binkz77 it's not out yet :-)
[3:41:56] d0nkles: is 6 rroll gone?
[3:41:57] Nachozdood: @binkz77 not all classes have been updated no reason to play the ones that have not been
[3:42:06] ShadoodHD: i wasn't implying eso combat but oki
[3:42:07] havenbirch: WoW combat is zoom zoom
[3:42:30] looney199725: elder scrolls combat has been bad for ages elder scrolls combat is its weak point
[3:42:30] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:42:37] Hypertitan: wow's combat is by far the most fluid
[3:42:37] looney199725: even in skyrim the combat system sucked
[3:42:41] Lightasaurus: Darkfall had better combat
[3:42:42] Funderik: the blizzard polish shows with combat
[3:42:44] BunnyMountain: yeah its why i cant play 14 the combat there is slow and sluggish
[3:43:11] szble: yeah hopefully ashes doesnt go the wrong direction
[3:43:36] hackenshaw: UI looks good
[3:43:51] Nachozdood: the character design in AoC looks so bad
[3:43:51] cappei: Unfortunately, Ashes combat looks anything but smooth and polished. Yeah, it's still early development, but it's looking very mediocre.
[3:43:54] looney199725: ashes isnt having wow level combat they showed there combat idea
[3:44:05] SirVoro: My gunnars just arrived
[3:44:13] robert_332: Vancleef
[3:44:14] Grimrg: the talent tree for outlaw is really bad compared to others atm
[3:44:19] Alienfromger: i heard aoc changed combat system
[3:44:40] wdotk: lol
[3:44:40] szble: true
[3:44:46] Nachozdood: @Alienfromger since the most recent video they put out for it
[3:44:48] d0nkles: Don't worry about Ashes until its actually a game LUL
[3:44:52] looney199725: i aint worried about AOC being good

[3:45:01] looney199725: its just gonna be another high graphic flop
[3:45:13] Nachozdood: Riot MMO will be more of a threat then Aoc ever will be
[3:45:16] scumlucki: @looney199725 probably not
[3:45:20] luckfore: ashes coming in 5 years towcopium
[3:45:23] luckfore: towCopium
[3:45:26] akia03: can you play outlaw without roll the bones or is that to much a nerf
[3:45:36] elrawin: Does anyone else remember when New World was a huge threat to wow then it started melting peoples GPUs
[3:45:45] Nachozdood: Ghostcrawler at least knows how mmos should kinda work
[3:45:45] szble: we'll see what ghostcrawler comes up with
[3:45:47] scumlucki: @elrawin it never was
[3:46:15] Ghostzapp3r: Colts report tomorrow. You ready for another season  @towelliee ?

[3:47:37] gandalfsbeard24: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP g
[3:47:42] d0nkles: Would love a viable outlaw with just slice n dice
[3:47:44] m3rk_zion: Rofl, Cow rogue.... super sneaky lol
[3:47:59] wakeandbacon95: Jebasted
[3:48:00] thunderioum: this is what the animation should be when you roll the dice OMEGAROLL @Towelliee
[3:48:01] Mojohusk: Don't understand why they don't just implement it into offhand attacks or something. It's just a botton you hit once every 45 sec
[3:48:03] KydSage: they changed the blade flurry animation Sadge
[3:48:10] Thanistrom: wtf is that a tauren rogue?
[3:48:11] Daikanatv: @Norezion will never hear the moo coming
[3:48:12] Molvonos: @Norezion Cows kill more people annually than sharks.  Best watch your back, a cow might be coming after you.
[3:48:17] looney199725: theres still hardly anything to show for it
[3:48:18] Pexaan: tauren rogue? oh god towellie why T_T
[3:48:21] matching_towels: Do you think changing talent loadouts should also change your macros/bars if you’ve saved  a layout? Could be really handy
[3:48:24] szble: those cosmetic packs are shameless
[3:48:29] PokerFaceMoose: Steven is pretty wealthy and he wants to make his perfect game.
[3:48:30] BunnyMountain: just need to change roll the bones to "chuck the dice" and just toss them at the enemy for dmg
[3:48:37] hateful88: hateful88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[3:48:43] looney199725: i dunno i dont expect it to be any good
[3:48:46] PrimalRain: it's still super early.
[3:48:49] scumlucki: peoplealways say mmo take time to make then complain about it taking time to make
[3:48:49] convrge: Everytime i read AoC i just think of the Age of Conan mmo from back in the day haha
[3:48:51] looney199725: just looks like another high graphic game
[3:48:52] Tornadogenesis: Nobody is forced to buy those cosmetic packs, though. It's not like "buy them or you will never be able to play the game."
[3:48:56] xendros78: perma tech demo stage
[3:48:57] PrimalRain: I hope it's good, but not getting my hopes up
[3:49:02] AlternateProject: @looney199725 that's some big COPIUM right there
[3:49:03] SyWr: tauren with sprint and invisible spot the "wrong" xD
[3:49:04] Kasvot_Vaxt: games take time this is why most studios dont show pre-alpha games because people dont understand
[3:49:05] nvnto: star citizen ready yet?
[3:49:12] ShadoodHD: just like stars citizen, just you wait towCopium
[3:49:17] m3rk_zion: I mean I knew that one lol, but still... the hoof clops on the tile of some raids should give away the rogues location LUL KEKW
[3:49:19] dayshftw: Are you using any addons in alpha?
[3:49:29] akia03: did bliz anounce what the endgame solo gameplay is going to in df?
[3:49:30] scumlucki: what happened to corepunk
[3:49:33] Shadoww_Fox: @Towelliee you get the Sha mount?? i remember you farming every single day.. :D

[3:50:03] matching_towels: Blizzard need to build in the myslot addon for loadouts
[3:50:05] xendros78: ashes of creation should change their logo to towCopium
[3:50:09] Alienfromger: @acreas_irl holy copium ashes of creation
[3:50:11] m3rk_zion: AOC? Ashes of Creations?
[3:50:22] mayonaes: We will always have WoW to cradle us payoCozy
[3:50:40] silodin: Between the eyes
[3:51:05] PvtHudson093: bussy......
[3:51:19] looney199725: the whole idea around AOC seens dumb 1 person can fly on a server tge rest cant and all that silly ideas
[3:51:20] akia03: should be a passive
[3:51:25] mayonaes: it is broken
[3:51:27] akia03: its bugged
[3:51:28] d0nkles: WIP I guess
[3:51:29] mayonaes: you can spam it
[3:51:32] KydSage: Sadge
[3:51:33] mayonaes: it is broken
[3:51:33] ceranac23: bugged
[3:51:42] looney199725: outlaw is broken
[3:51:44] chambiann: bugged my friend
[3:51:45] looney199725: i wouldnt waste your time
[3:51:56] Kloshx: The entire outlaw in retail works around that skill tbh
[3:51:58] looney199725: outlaw has been broken for awhile
[3:52:24] mayonaes: 5k pistol shot is a lot because you can spam it with the broken greenskin passive
[3:52:41] m3rk_zion: I wonder if they are upping the Gold cap with this go
[3:52:43] Pexaan: creating a tauren rogue is where it all fell apart, jk LUL
[3:52:52] PleaseDontInvade: @Towelliee how is dk rn been thinking about buying dragonflight
[3:53:13] akia03: shame they didnt also added the shotgun lego from sl to outlaw
[3:53:17] zastin586: pretty much
[3:53:17] looney199725: its not what they showing its what they saying they want from the game
[3:53:19] looney199725: is the issue
[3:53:21] Hypertitan: junish was alpha 1 last year
[3:53:26] DoodleNoodle: AOC is the new Star Citizen
[3:53:32] Hypertitan: and yeah alpha 2 is sometime this year
[3:53:41] Velashen: That failed battle royale too
[3:53:44] Alienfromger: you tell us you have alpha access LUL
[3:53:48] mayonaes: AOC will always be Age of Conan for me
[3:54:02] looney199725: they showed there combat a month ago its like skyrim combat
[3:54:14] xendros78: tech demo 2 LUL
[3:54:14] hddndoors: they switched engines?
[3:54:15] lukaskar: @Towelliee will there be some sort of squish in dragonflight?
[3:54:18] akia03: @mayonaes that was what i thought they where talking about
[3:54:18] luckfore: 2025 way to soon
[3:54:21] m3rk_zion: @mayonaes That's what I was thinking too lol
[3:54:26] Lataran: could actually collide with riot mmo wich would be bad for them iguess
[3:54:32] PrimalRain: if they want it to have a chance it needs 3+ more years for sure
[3:54:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: its releasing the same year as Star Citizen
[3:54:35] ArcaneSyntax: which game?
[3:54:35] Hypertitan: there's a ton of changes from alpha 1 till now...but hearing everyones takes on a game we know next to nothing about is hilarious
[3:54:35] ceranac23: 2025 way too sonn another rushed game
[3:54:39] ceranac23: kekw
[3:54:45] Tornadogenesis: It takes a long time to make good games, to be fair. Not everything is thrown together and thrown on Steam for "Early Access".

[3:54:54] m3rk_zion: Whos the devs of AOC?
[3:54:55] magemaster225: they gotta time it for when WoW has another downturn, so a while lol
[3:55:04] looney199725: no
[3:55:07] szble: think they showed like a melee combat update last month
[3:55:08] looney199725: its like skyrim combat
[3:55:22] looney199725: its legit like skyrim combat
[3:55:24] mayonaes: They spent that 400 on a new coffee machine
[3:55:25] Pexaan: ashes of creation?
[3:55:25] Alienfromger: whats with that other oldskool mmo what coh played?
[3:55:26] Zen1HP: To redo those talent trees for every single class/spec… yea lol I’m sure it’ll take time.
[3:55:26] looney199725: makes no sense
[3:55:27] Hypertitan: @Norezion Intrepid I think
[3:55:28] Pexaan: no way
[3:55:35] zastin586: just hope it doesn't end up like SWTOR (F2P) or Wildstar
[3:55:36] elrawin: I wanna play AoC but they’re only developing for PC with no plans for mac version and I really dont want a PC

[3:55:39] Kasvot_Vaxt: GabeN @looney199725 tf no its not, did you even watch the last showcase?
[3:55:43] m3rk_zion: @Norezion Never heard of them, will have to check it out.
[3:55:43] Architank: I'm not expecting the game until 2026 at the earliest.
[3:55:43] scumlucki: the mage combat from the first alpha was so bad lol
[3:55:49] Pexaan: the combat I saw was more like black desert
[3:55:50] 91Niki: I mean they could've pulled a "the day before". having a completely finished game, and a month before planned release they delay it a year cuz they are swapping engine KEKW
[3:55:54] looney199725: dont get me wrong it would be great if its good but with current mmo doubtful
[3:55:57] Pexaan: nowhere close to skyrim
[3:56:08] PvtHudson093: you have as much chance of The Winds of Winter coming out as you do AoC
[3:56:14] Nachozdood: i can see the youtube vids now Asmongold reacts to bellular video  AOC is a scam
[3:56:15] remixonfire91: Riot mmo for sure LUL
[3:56:16] mayonaes: We all want AOC to be a success and launch sooner than later but we are realist and it does not look like it is going well
[3:56:17] PrimalRain: riot will come first I bet
[3:56:19] Nanonaps: AoC or Star Citizen final release Kappa
[3:56:19] LiveFromStua: Have we seen anything form Riots mmo?
[3:56:21] Kasvot_Vaxt: its tab target, action combat hybrid
[3:56:22] Gargantix: AoC Prediction: Eclipsed by Riot MMO LUL
[3:56:23] BunnyMountain: i just want riot's fighting game
[3:56:23] Siddydiddydo: AOC at least has a product to show lol
[3:56:23] Tornadogenesis: Riot has much more money and resources, I would hope so.
[3:56:24] Hypertitan: I would say riot haha
[3:56:25] looney199725: riot mmo will prob be better than aoc
[3:56:26] looney199725: lets be real
[3:56:29] MimikTheMonk: Riot has brand recognition going for it, just like Warcraft did going into WoW
[3:56:32] magemaster225: Riot MMO beta next year, bet
[3:56:35] Architank: @kasvot_vaxt pressing left click to swing sword equals Skyrim Kappa
[3:56:38] Hypertitan: we've seen fuckin nothing of riot's mmo haha
[3:56:40] 91Niki: Not even the tip of a toe
[3:56:43] Zen1HP: Ashes first for sure. Alpha 2 is coming soon and they will leave the servers open.
[3:56:47] mayonaes: Riot has $$$$
[3:56:48] looney199725: riot has alot of peoples trust
[3:56:50] m3rk_zion: If it's taken them 14 - 15 months to go from Alpha 1 to oblivion with AOC.... Riot has 100% better chance to beat out AOC.
[3:56:51] PrimalRain: their fighting game will come first then I bet we'll hear more about the riot mmo
[3:56:51] Kasvot_Vaxt: @Vanguard771 LuL
[3:56:52] CruzM8: Riot has yet to disappoint with every game theyve made so far
[3:56:53] DoubleNova: that thing is top secret
[3:56:55] metavahn231: pantheon kek
[3:56:57] Pexaan: riot reputation is top tier from previous projects
[3:56:58] KydSage: Riot got hella assets at the ready tbh
[3:56:59] CasuallyEfficient: Is pantheon a scam or what
[3:56:59] LiveFromStua: KEKW That is not good. Now I feel uneasy about ashes
[3:57:00] Gargantix: I have faith in Ghostcrawler
[3:57:01] Angxlic: greg said they will have stuff to show by the end of this year
[3:57:04] cappei: Hopefully Riot MMO isn't top-down like Lost Ark. That would completely kill my interest
[3:57:06] MaleFrom73: I hope AOC and Riots game will be good. Wow needs real competition.
[3:57:06] Pexaan: everyone got high hopes for riot
[3:57:08] Tornadogenesis: Ghostcrawler said they will not ship a bad game and it's possible the game may not happen.
[3:57:08] Lataran: i mean every riot game is succsesfull
[3:57:09] resamury: riot is like blizzard used to be sadge
[3:57:14] zastin586: Riot has the advantage of already established world if it's connected to LoL in anyway, AoC is starting from scratch
[3:57:14] Nachozdood: we know what the art style will look like roguhly
[3:57:18] Zen1HP: And the tencent to back them up LOL
[3:57:19] ArcaneSyntax: I still think people are massively over hyping riot's mmo
[3:57:23] cdk058: Talent? They copy everythhing
[3:57:25] Alienfromger: towelliee you forgot pantheon KEKW
[3:57:27] d0nkles: Riot MMO might be more like genshin hero system? That's my guess
[3:57:27] m3rk_zion: ehhhh I wouldn't put Riot and Trustworthy in the same senstens... Riot is... consistent to say the least lol
[3:57:31] chambiann: Dont think we should hype it up this much tbh. Lets see when we actually got something to see.
[3:57:31] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[3:57:34] looney199725: riot mmo has alot of promise tbh
[3:57:34] Hypertitan: I feel like riot's mmo is farther along that we think...they're just showing nothing
[3:57:37] elrawin: Remember when people said Cyberpunk would be good because CDPR are trustworthy… we’ll see what happens
[3:57:40] shaditus: how can you belive in something that you didnt even see?
[3:57:42] Pexaan: LUL
[3:57:44] blntmasta420: delHi
[3:57:45] 91Niki: @cdk058 Who and what are they copying exactly?
[3:57:47] BunnyMountain: yeah pantheon is never happening lol
[3:57:49] crich85: crich85 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[3:57:50] Hypertitan: Pantheon LUL
[3:57:53] Zen1HP: Tencent will have a lot of influence in the MMO, for sure.
[3:57:54] Gargantix: @ArcaneSyntax if you've watched Arcane, you'll know why people are hyped. The story telling potential for an MMO RPG is off the scales.
[3:58:01] LiveFromStua: Riot is owned by 10 cent now tho. Micro all over the place? Or more like new world?
[3:58:02] looney199725: the success rate of mmos nowadays are so low
[3:58:02] fyfaentv: I think Riot MMO will shock everyone. In a good way
[3:58:02] Collected1: Pantheon is dead on arrival. A sub model is a huge mistake.
[3:58:10] szble: arcane? BatChest
[3:58:15] magakigr: what did i miss, just tuned in and i see mucho invites? big wave tomorrow ?
[3:58:17] BunnyMountain: its been what 8 years and what do they have 2 zones and 1 dungeon ?
[3:58:17] Tornadogenesis: The brains behind Pantheon passed away IRL. I gave up on it.
[3:58:20] hutzika: I wonder how and when mike morhaime's game dreamhaven is gonna launch and what it is about
[3:58:20] xendros78: pantheon is dead on arrival once the eq andys start hating on it
[3:58:20] nvnto: riot did a great job with their take on tactical fps, i'm optimistic about their mmo. but who knows.

[3:58:25] remixonfire91: im not sure how they will do classes on riot MMO but my bet would be sticking to Leagues roles like Marksman mage tank etc
[3:58:29] ArcaneSyntax: @gargantix I've seen arcane, a show being good doesn't make the game good.
[3:58:29] CruzM8: If youve played league of legends you know how big the world is and how deep the lore goes thats why i think it could be a banger
[3:58:32] cdk058: @91niki lol tft valorant to name some
[3:58:38] ElDrakenMan: I have faith in pantheon only because Cohh Carnage is involved with that game pretty heavy
[3:58:41] Pexaan: taking one for the team, respect
[3:58:44] Gargantix: @ArcaneSyntax never said it did.
[3:58:45] looney199725: only other company i expect to even made a gd mmo is riot
[3:58:45] Mecabeast: how's lux's new paladin wa for wrath?
[3:58:47] looney199725: the rest eh
[3:58:50] Hypertitan: I don't think pantheon is every going to be finished
[3:58:54] scumlucki: riot mmo might not even have character customization might just be league skins in an mmo setting lol
[3:58:55] fewyn: so we're saying you shouldn't kickstart MMOs anymore?
[3:59:01] szble: dont think ive heard of it
[3:59:02] Collected1: drakenPWN : he has no control over it.
[3:59:06] Shifty_CZ: STOP IT
[3:59:10] PrimalRain: I kickstarted oath FeelsBadMan
[3:59:18] DoubleNova: kickstart mine Kappa
[3:59:18] looney199725: should have kick started bleak faith its coming out soon
[3:59:25] Holysal: @Hypertitan i think that too but they did get a inventment. see that helps
[3:59:27] Zen1HP: We gotta support the genre LUL
[3:59:41] Gargantix: @ArcaneSyntax just telling you why people are hyped, and where the sets of expectations come from.
[3:59:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want wrath beta just so i can map out all my abilities on my bars LUL
[3:59:43] Collected1: Cohh *wants* pantheon to release and be the new Everquest. but that doesn't mean he's improving the chances of it being so.
[3:59:51] silodin: Wildstar
[3:59:52] 91Niki: @cdk058 So, you're saying they're copying the game style or art style? I'm just trying to understand
[3:59:53] NotYetRatedd: bless online
[3:59:54] NotYetRatedd: or something
[3:59:55] cappei: Bless Online?

[4:00:01] fleet21_: crowfall? KEKW
[4:00:02] Tazhaar93: Atlass?

[4:00:11] fewyn: i forgot about crowfall
[4:00:14] Velashen: Bless and crowfall
[4:00:15] Zen1HP: Crowfall
[4:00:17] Gargantix: Anthem? LUL
[4:00:19] ChrisarN: Crowfall failed hard
[4:00:21] Crisis88: That's because Crowfall promised a MMO style game and delivered a lackluster empty survival
[4:00:25] Just2Nasty801: is WOW worth getting back into right now?
[4:00:26] Nanonaps: jsut don't google funny things like chronicles of elyria LUL
[4:00:29] buckshot9000: Theres a new build tomorrow?
[4:00:31] Pexaan: it's a niche for sure
[4:00:32] ArcaneSyntax: @gargantix okay? this doesn't change my opinion lol
[4:00:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: crowfail Kappa
[4:00:40] looney199725: its gonna be hard to pull ppl away from wow and ff mmos
[4:00:45] Velashen: Bless failed multiple releases. It was bordering as a full scam.
[4:00:47] Alienfromger: the crow falls deep Kappa
[4:00:48] Gargantix: @ArcaneSyntax not trying to change your opinion o_O
[4:00:50] PrillaGorilla: @Gargantix Ugh, I forgot about that game and how much I wanted it to be good. Sad
[4:00:52] cappei: Give us your class predictions for tomorrow
[4:00:52] Nachozdood: like that space game thats stuck in development hell

[4:20:10] TheZofren: Is this music from the dungeon?
[4:20:10] MoonChocolates: I love coca cola in the morning with ice
[4:20:14] jasonbriggs: @Towelliee do you think the new uldaman is better than classic one
[4:20:16] Llamatude: @dummigummii its a remake of it
[4:20:17] Sollice: Thats not the way we ask questions though
[4:20:20] officialviz: Sounds like someones a crack hater
[4:20:27] GamingDad77: i agree
[4:20:36] gumzydumzy: @Llamatude oooh makes sense the start was so similer
[4:20:46] Sollice: I hate crack for sure...I freebase heroin. That's how we do it up in here
[4:20:46] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:20:57] officialviz: China white is my goto
[4:21:14] nightwolf_87: whelp is healing xD
[4:21:52] Lor0ark: I'm curious about the dps of this ferals
[4:22:28] Gargantix: there's a bug I can see on your UI where the boss' portrait frame on the right hand side (smaller one) still shows all the debuffs on him when there are none
[4:22:30] infinitrus: lmao welfare
[4:22:34] mavericks312: wish version of uldaman
[4:22:37] Llamatude: this place as M+ is going to suck! Soo many bosses lol
[4:22:40] baltasarr80: Does the old one still exist?
[4:22:42] qineticc: I want deadmines M+
[4:23:04] wisplingz: last boss is so similar to mordechai redmoon fight from Wildstar
[4:23:19] Brodih_: imagine Mara with todays graphics!
[4:23:25] nightwolf_87: @Towelliee why there is no new abilties in this expansion?
[4:23:32] AwelessOne: Scarlet Monastary M+ would be lit
[4:23:33] Darisen: this doesnt look like a good M+ dungeon
[4:23:34] Gargantix: you say that @Towelliee but the old versions of RFC, WC and SFK don't exist still
[4:23:38] baltasarr80: goood to know ... i loved the old Uldaman with the enchanting trainer within xD
[4:23:42] griffdog125: Sunken temple
[4:23:43] Sollice: @nightwolf_87 Because they completely redid the talent trees
[4:23:43] Mecabeast: imagine dire maul remake
[4:23:45] Clucky2988: is there a great vault in dragonflight for m+ etc?
[4:23:49] thebakeriscomingforu: For dungeons I'd rather have the layout be linear. With a wide open dungeon everyone develops routes and skips anyways.
[4:23:55] Whippedkreme: Whippedkreme subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[4:23:59] baltasarr80: 20 bosses and many trash packs :)
[4:24:01] whielle: acid rain woooo  what a great torghast ability
[4:24:01] Holysal: @nightwolf_87 no burrowed power
[4:24:10] Holysal: @nightwolf_87 borrowed
[4:24:18] vulkankragon: any news on the return of 10 men raids?
[4:24:50] 2DaNNIe747: why not play wotlk if you want 10m
[4:24:53] AwelessOne: can't you still 10 man raid normal and heroic? or you want 10 man mythic?
[4:24:58] doomester: @Towelliee looking forward to Brewmasters talent
[4:25:12] mavericks312: @vulkankragon technically you can still 10 man raids
[4:25:17] Bergsholt: 26th september?
[4:25:23] Obarok: @Towelliee chances for glad stance returning?
[4:25:24] Buckshater: @Towelliee while this is a half joke, I think it's also half serious.. .think they'll recycle onyxia back in again?
[4:25:25] Mojoejenkins: how does the guardian feel at the moment?
[4:25:28] OmgItsEdizzle: cant you still play 10 man with flex?
[4:25:38] Gezber: POGGERS
[4:25:45] vulkankragon: @mavericks312 yes but its not optimal
[4:26:09] steward93: Just tuned in to "GALATIC BEAR MODE, REEEEE" lmao
[4:26:18] Molvonos: Oh I hope not, let that mob stay dead.
[4:26:18] Dankind64: that would be cool
[4:26:23] mavericks312: @vulkankragon if your not the top 3% does optimal really matter?
[4:26:24] Wcvechten: infinite dragonflight dragging her out another timeline
[4:26:25] AwelessOne: can't wait for sylvanas to come back as a dragon
[4:26:29] Buckshater: @Towelliee as much as I don't want to see Onyxia again, it would make sense this expansion
[4:26:31] looney199725: i think we may see 1 or 2 2-3 boss raids
[4:26:36] OviTheGray: she only died like 3 times :)
[4:26:39] Architank: with the infinite dragonflight doing timey wimey stuff anything is possible
[4:26:39] DoubleNova: anyone can return right?
[4:26:44] abracka_: their remains were completely destroyed though
[4:26:44] szble: sinestra probably not onyxia
[4:26:50] Mecabeast: many welps handle it
[4:26:52] exilethegamer: It’s going to be a headless onyxia this time
[4:26:54] zanches98: how does it make sense? she's dead?
[4:26:56] baltasarr80: Not Arthas
[4:27:00] Artiiz: Are feral druid good in alpha?
[4:27:03] DoubleNova: Is there an evil dragon?
[4:27:04] Funderik: with the infinite dragons, anyone can return, time travel is a hell of a drug
[4:27:04] Cakeabsorber: Onyxia the headless dragon?
[4:27:06] Quecklain: fighting onyxia in the maw PogChamp
[4:27:09] Velashen: Jailers epic tale will continue Kappa
[4:27:23] looney199725: chromagus gonna show up and show us what power is
[4:27:24] scumlucki: so is arthas like  dead dead?
[4:27:36] mavericks312: the jailer was trying to warn us about hallion reborn lol
[4:27:50] scumlucki: bummer dude was pretty cool
[4:27:50] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:27:54] Wcvechten: infinite dragons will drag him from an alternate timeline too, ez arthas
[4:27:57] Ramzilla92: so was gul'dan xD
[4:27:57] im_n0t_jezus: HE DID too much lol
[4:27:59] BigBadShadows: what is the best tank in your opinion
[4:28:00] OviTheGray: we can bring back an alternate universe Arthas
[4:28:01] Architank: ugh don't remind me about that
[4:28:02] LearnedSomething: arthas rerolled evoker
[4:28:03] zigzugg: easy
[4:28:04] Artiiz: Are  feral druid good in alpha?
[4:28:04] DoubleNova: time travel he alive though right?
[4:28:05] zigzugg: time skip
[4:28:06] abracka_: onyxia/nefarian are technically gone gone too. we demolished their remains in bfa, used the last scales for the cloak
[4:28:08] Fusionxw: arthas comes back this year in classic noob
[4:28:09] Alienfromger: not with alternate timelines Kappa
[4:28:10] Venasmat: Easy, Arthas from the past, boom easy
[4:28:11] Akermay: WoW Multiverse of Madness, here we come
[4:28:11] WhiteKnight74648: Through the power of friendship, arthas will return :)
[4:28:11] KydSage: no king rules forever
[4:28:18] ZeusDNA: The multiverse of WoWness
[4:28:18] Llamatude: Alt Reality again with WOD
[4:28:18] TheZofren: AU Lordaeron POGGERS
[4:28:21] jasonbriggs: chromie
[4:28:23] thebakeriscomingforu: Blizz writers were so tired of hearing about Arthas they made it so he is gone GONE.
[4:28:27] Cakeabsorber: KEKW
[4:28:28] Artiiz: Do you think we'll see Anduin as a King again?
[4:28:29] mandilozano: another WoD
[4:28:30] Redpandalol: Maybe an echo of him
[4:28:33] Funderik: nah leave arthas as 35 anima, work on new characters.
[4:28:36] jaqk088: Arthusception
[4:28:38] WhiteKnight74648: Alternate timeline
[4:28:40] ShadoodHD: why that's simple.... bring him back from cot and kill him again Kappa
[4:28:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna pull a palpatine and just say somehow arthas has returned
[4:28:47] Nachozdood: they did Arthas wrong
[4:28:48] Rudric_Ice: you really love playing guardian druid huh
[4:28:52] Nachozdood: should have just left him dead
[4:28:53] AwelessOne: ay feral did more than tanak dps
[4:29:03] scumlucki: @Funderik you say that knowing very well we gonna see sylvanas in 10.3
[4:29:06] Cakeabsorber: we did get tbc v2 we should get a wotlk v2 KEKW
[4:29:07] ArcaneMaki: Can we get a link to that log?
[4:29:14] Artiiz: peepoSad Shadow priest dmg
[4:29:16] Smelladafarts: Smelladafarts subscribed with Prime. 
[4:29:16] Smelladafarts: Smelladafarts subscribed with Prime. 
[4:29:20] Lor0ark: ferals look good right?
[4:29:20] Architank: They should have brought Arthas back to kill Sylvanas One. More. Time. would've been great
[4:29:22] Sollice: Yeah the Arthas ending was.....yeah
[4:29:27] Mojohusk: Didn't wanna make the others feel bad
[4:29:27] Fusionxw: the WoW is pretty boring though. Nothing compared to LOTR or Warhammers lore. Blizzard dead game
[4:29:30] looney199725: @STK_Lucki sylvanas we know is coming back cuz shes only being punished till she frees the souls
[4:29:35] ArcaneMaki: Mind sharing log @Towelliee ?
[4:29:39] ShadoodHD: what ending :)
[4:29:40] Rudric_Ice: the guy was too tired of dps'ing and healing
[4:29:44] drailyodude: ferals for the Win
[4:29:51] Towelliee: ttps://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/4xjP618wdqAcCTQG/#fight=7
[4:29:56] Towelliee: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/4xjP618wdqAcCTQG/#fight=7
[4:29:57] ArcaneMaki: ty
[4:30:01] Zinaroth: Dont worry they will be nerfed before live as always :D
[4:30:03] scumlucki: i also like how blizz forgot about nathanos ha fuck that guy
[4:30:07] Nachozdood: @Towelliee do you think they ended Garrosh in a good way or did him dirty?
[4:30:22] Sollice: @Nachozdood Sylvy is looking for her love somewhere in Torghast
[4:30:25] Llamatude: don't worry Blizzard will Neuter them again, As bob barker says "Don't forget to spay and neuter your cats!"
[4:30:25] Fusionxw: the only thing blizzard doesnt forget is how to get your wallet LUL
[4:30:29] Bergsholt: Healers that do no damage are just lazy
[4:30:42] Rudric_Ice: good fuck that guy anyways
[4:30:49] szble: probably some anima
[4:30:56] dannyis1337: "I'm coming my Queen" gets forgotten
[4:30:57] TheZofren: Makes you wonder if there was a cut patch
[4:31:10] Molvonos: @Nachozdood She's on a sidequest to find all of his bodyparts, so she can stitch together her pet again.
[4:31:18] scumlucki: nathanos was used to make my shitty legendary
[4:31:21] looney199725: im waitin for sylvanas and anduin to come out from sl with a child
[4:31:26] looney199725: thats the kinda lame shit they gonna pull
[4:31:36] vulkankragon: a whole bunch of lore characters like varian, tirion, etc weren't seen in shadowlands
[4:31:37] scumlucki: @looney199725 thats def something blizz would do
[4:31:38] OviTheGray: @dannyis1337 new queen.. Queen Alexstrasza :)
[4:31:41] Dankind64: second to last MM run
[4:31:48] Endin: I mean its not a mythic plus, healers gonna heal
[4:31:49] Fusionxw: atleast you know its gonna be lame lol
[4:31:54] Sollice: Varian was seen...kind of
[4:31:54] szble: weird ship
[4:32:05] Sollice: But the lore was his soul was destroyed by fel so he never went to the shadowlands
[4:32:08] Deathlord_Deathvoid: Do you have a Holy Priest Build yet?
[4:32:17] Architank: I would bet most healers outside of mythic+ don't do any damage
[4:32:20] b2k_DaftLeech: !TFA

[4:32:21] Feliani_: What do you mean mucho invites? Are they going to be doing a big invite wave?
[4:32:28] drailyodude: have you seen any outlaw rogues in dungeons?
[4:32:29] scumlucki: i also like how the entirety of the shadowlands fucking morgraine and jaina did more than bolvar or baine
[4:32:31] Brick_Bosworth: Brick_Bosworth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[4:32:31] Artiiz: Are feral druid good in alpha?
[4:32:32] Cakeabsorber: I dont heal GIGADAPH
[4:32:47] wisplingz: did you try outlaw rogue yet
[4:32:52] Wcvechten: yeah, one of our guilds' healers hates dpsing as it doesn't make him feel like a healer, so yeah
[4:32:58] Rudric_Ice: @looney199725  ahh yes lets make necrophillia  a thing in WoW
[4:33:04] Sollice: @STK_Lucki Baine lol. He never does anything :)
[4:33:09] zgag: Towelliee. Word is that Kill cleave for BM isn't working on the Alpha.
[4:33:17] piggey__: @Towelliee depends on the tank, sometimes you feel like the tanks doesn't need healing at all, and you dps some, or if the tank feels useless and you dont touch the mobs in fear of them dying instantly
[4:33:18] mavericks312: also isnt psy like the last of the feral druids
[4:33:30] Avatarblade: blizz just likes trolling feral in alphas
[4:33:34] Pike_man: @Towelliee Do you ever want to experience an expansion for the first time on live?
[4:33:39] Shrenko: towCopium
[4:33:39] Inthezonewow: towCopium towCopium
[4:33:40] nvnto: towCopium
[4:33:44] Zinaroth: Because they always end up getting nerfed before live
[4:33:49] Havoc_S1: towCopium
[4:33:49] Sollice: YEAR OF THE FERAL
[4:33:49] AveragePvp: So ferals are cowboys fans?
[4:33:49] abracka_: prot warrior right next to them smoking a copium joint
[4:33:51] Elseworldz: That happened on 9.2 PTR too
[4:33:52] kreff_: yeah I play feral still, i dont give a shit that we suck.. FeelsBadMan
[4:33:53] Elseworldz: RIP
[4:33:55] LearnedSomething: bunch of furries don't care
[4:33:56] Scoodles91: feral need the servival treatment, make them insaaanely OP for a patch so ppl dont hate them
[4:33:58] ATV93: nice copium emote lol
[4:33:59] AwelessOne: ret paladin deserve one patch where they get survival treatment
[4:34:01] thebakeriscomingforu: problem is that melee dps is a competitive slot in dungeons and raids
[4:34:05] mavericks312: why try on a cat when a chicken just goes brrrrr
[4:34:09] Velashen: Feral is whatever. I think the limited animations in combat bother me more than the tuning.
[4:34:12] Rudric_Ice: Yes lets make Sodapoppin come back to WoW again
[4:34:27] zgag: Beast cleave yes, not kill cleave.  KC is a new talent for BM
[4:34:29] onybear: I do t understand the whole “healed should be doing damage”…just let them heal, if they help with damage then great but do t expect it.
[4:34:34] kreff_: I wanna get MoP levels of feral back pls
[4:34:36] zgag: Why it doesn't show on the logs
[4:34:48] Phobyac: Toallas te relajas
[4:35:11] kreff_: sucks to see that Disc does more damage than me on feral BibleThump
[4:35:24] abracka_: what's the best allergy medication? i never had allergies until this year and i am dying
[4:35:25] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[4:35:26] scumlucki: im sick and tired of fury im going back to my roots as an arms woyer
[4:35:29] Architank: @onybear Mythic+ is a different setting. Everyone has to be pushing the limit to survive and successfully key the dungeon.
[4:35:40] Elseworldz: @onybear The only reason I agree with this is because I don't want people expecting me to heal as a dps in some scenarios. Listen I came here to do ONE job, and that's ALL I came here to do.
[4:36:00] Rudric_Ice: when i heal i dont try to dps im just too lazy
[4:36:14] PToastman: When I tank I don’t try and dps
[4:36:24] Saetto: @onybear the only thing that bothers me .. is like … some heals do massive dmg … and some like .. none … had a shaman that did massive dmg … then a druid … it was like minus dmg LUL
[4:36:34] Bergsholt: Healers that don't do damage are just lazy, it's fine to be lazy, but don't come up with some excuses to why you don't do damage
[4:36:44] Elseworldz: I feel like the "healers must dps" comes from people doing keys most of the players who even bother with M+ will never even see. Like stuff above 15s.
[4:37:00] Elseworldz: At that point who gives a shit about what they have to say
[4:37:19] Rudric_Ice: im playing my "Role" i dont wanna dps get the fuck outta here
[4:37:27] kreff_: ^
[4:37:27] onybear: @vanguard771 fair enough…I guess I am a bit old school because mana was such a precious commodity back in vanilla and bc and I didn’t have it to spare for dps lol.
[4:37:36] Mecabeast: healer dps can easily be the difference between timing the key or not above 20s
[4:38:05] Saetto: @mecabeast thats the point … it shouldn‘t be needed
[4:38:20] PToastman: But it helps
[4:38:23] Elseworldz: Meh, 20 keys. Most players don't even do above 15s I'm quite sure.
[4:38:29] Venasmat: The more you dps as a healer, the easier it gets for you to heal, that's my philosophy
[4:38:37] DoubleNova: Is preservation healer similar to any other healer?
[4:38:42] kreff_: I dont do mythic dungeons at all.. not my cup of tea
[4:38:42] psyborg_x420: it evens out, if dps dont take uneccesary dmg healer can help with dps
[4:38:51] Rudric_Ice: @Pouilla hows that ?
[4:39:04] onybear: I wish I could say that it is only in high keys…I get yelled at just about anywhere for not having high enough dps as a healer…it’s stupid
[4:39:22] Venasmat: @Rudric_Ice Things dies when you dps just even a little bit
[4:39:28] Elseworldz: @onybear Those people are idiots. Meta slaves are the worst thing to happen to wow imo.
[4:39:30] kreff_: i wonder whats the % of people who do mythic+ in wow in general
[4:39:46] DoubleNova: low probably
[4:39:47] Mecabeast: also some dps need a gcd or 2 to recover health ie fury warrior using enraged regen can recover like 25% with 2 blood thirsts
[4:39:48] Havoc_S1: And that’s why those roles will always be hard to find because no one wants to do them
[4:39:59] matching_towels: my rDruid has a third of the dps of my rSham. The spec has a lot to do with it
[4:40:00] onybear: @elseworldz I agree…
[4:40:07] Bergsholt: A lot of healers seems pressed, it's fine that don't wanna do dmg, you are just lazy. Healers have so much downtime if the group knows what to do
[4:40:11] Architank: @onybear yeah mana is much more available nowadays and DPSing doesn't always mean throwing out a full rotation. As a resto shaman I tag every enemy with flameshock in between heals and send out lavaburst procs at a minimum.
[4:40:24] Elseworldz: The more responsibility you put on a role, the less players will play that role. And then people wonder why nobody plays it and look for Blizz to fix it somehow.
[4:40:27] DoubleNova: isn't it boring as a healer not doing dps?
[4:40:40] Bergsholt: +2
[4:40:49] MysticRaven_: @DoubleNova healers do dps
[4:40:56] Greybeard_ttv: I enjoy doing dps as a healer because of the down time you have especially as resto druid lol
[4:41:09] Venasmat: I mean, as @Vanguard771 it's not that hard to put some dot here and there between heals when your party is full
[4:41:20] Saetto: @matching_towels druid would do fine dps if he could just cast spells and shapeshift with them like dracthyr … or with spells not requiering moonkin form
[4:41:23] stabzmcgeee: if i wanted to dps then i would roll a freaking dps spec not a healer spec
[4:41:31] Greybeard_ttv: it's fun flipping back and forth to cat
[4:41:45] Elseworldz: @stabzmcgeee That is completely fair.
[4:41:59] Saetto: @stabzmcgeee thats why i love playing disc and monk heal LUL its just playing dps as a heal LUL
[4:42:13] MysticRaven_: i mean holy paly and disc priest heal using dps
[4:42:15] Greybeard_ttv: I mean you dont really have to dps unless you are pushing 20s lol
[4:42:51] Elseworldz: @Greybeard_ttv Tell that to the people in 10s and 15s who are putting undue pressure on healers.
[4:42:51] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[4:42:54] Saetto: @greybeard_ttv you don‘t have to … but more dmg equals less damage taken
[4:42:55] Bergsholt: But it must be boring with all that down time, are just sitting there waiting for people to lose hp?
[4:42:57] heder: Rumpa DansGame
[4:42:58] Bergsholt: Why not dps
[4:43:02] Rudric_Ice: who actually pushes 20s lets be real here prolly just the 1% of the playerbase
[4:43:04] Mr_Pennywise_: 🍑 💨 💩 towWipe
[4:43:19] Greybeard_ttv: it's just that most of the 1% meta slaves expect you to dps on an M0 lol
[4:43:20] AwelessOne: what? 20s are pretty common it feels like
[4:43:26] omar1987d: hi towelliee fan :D
[4:43:44] Elseworldz: @Rudric_Ice True. When the gear stops flowing, I imagine people don't even bother going past 15, if they even get there at all. Why go past 15 except for epeen?
[4:43:45] Venasmat: That's why I love playing healer in FF14 or GW2, you just play DPS and heal at the same time, more things to do
[4:43:49] Architank: The real fun is healing and trying to beat the DPS on the meters
[4:43:55] Rudric_Ice: @AwelessOne  its not
[4:44:04] Bergsholt: @Vanguard771 true
[4:44:04] Greybeard_ttv: yeah people are so over powered with 4 set and 2 legos that 15s are like 5s right now lol
[4:44:10] DoubleNova: what's the highest dps healer?
[4:44:11] Clucky2988: @Rudric_Ice 20's are the new 15's
[4:44:18] Molvonos: Imagine gatekeeping Healing.
[4:44:22] Rudric_Ice: 20s doesn't even give you high ilvl gear lol
[4:44:47] Bergsholt: Loved leveling as a healer in dungs, doing top dps almost all dungs

[4:45:23] onybear: I am not saying I don’t do dps, because yes, there is down time and I can.  But to have people being ridiculed for not doing dps as a healer I think is bull.  If you push 20’s then you know what your getting i to but if you are doing lfr and getting yelled at for not doing dps because you are with a bunch of morons that stand in everything …
[4:45:24] Elseworldz: I highly doubt most players who even do M+ are going beyond what gives them their max reward in the vault every week.
[4:45:44] Thoreya: lots of m+ talk this mornin huh
[4:45:48] copterskates: ;p
[4:45:52] ChrisStoll: Good TowLord I hope we get engineering profession in the next build. I'm excite

[4:46:36] zgag: Ions revenge
[4:46:46] Greybeard_ttv: How fun is enhance so far?
[4:47:07] Elseworldz: @Greybeard_ttv Out here asking the important questions. +100
[4:47:14] Venasmat: Though I agree healers shouldn't bepointed at for having low dps, healers SHOULD dps, but it's not an important metric for the role
[4:47:20] Greybeard_ttv: lmao
[4:47:35] Architank: @onybear LFR seems like the least chill experience in wow
[4:47:40] vercetti101: Yea I've been screen shotting my builds

[4:48:03] Rudric_Ice: @Pouilla thats forced gameplay there bud

[4:48:36] onybear: @vanguard771 yeah …that it is.
[4:48:43] Venasmat: @Rudric_Ice Forced gameplay for helping out your team reach a goal ?
[4:48:47] abracka_: feel like chain lightning and lightning crash should swap
[4:48:56] Saetto: i love that they split doom winds from the totem …
[4:49:10] Architank: @pouilla feels like we're a room of dps who don't use interrupts because that's not their job LUL
[4:49:16] abracka_: oh what the hell lol
[4:49:25] abracka_: oh that's the cd reduc
[4:49:42] MidianTV: It's just rank 2
[4:49:43] Velashen: Velashen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:50:14] Venasmat: @Vanguard771 But...interrupt is forced gameplay, I can't do dps if I interrupt
[4:50:14] polishguy734: Elemental shaman is where it’s at honestly.. the amount of damage stack you can do is stuuuuuuupid
[4:50:20] Elseworldz: Screw totems! YEAH!

[4:51:04] MedicineMan: Firelands theme PogChamp
[4:51:05] Templexx: outside of balancing they need to do love the trees they are doing
[4:51:05] Saetto: when df drops towelies shamen name will be „thetotemless“
[4:51:05] Nachozdood: have you tried Ele shaman yet?
[4:51:06] Rudric_Ice: @Pouilla  yes and a healer does that by healing but to each their own some healers do both some healers just heal :)
[4:51:25] polishguy734: Totems are pretty lame, only one worth it is the last totem you get that increases crit.
[4:51:31] TheItalianStallion321: morning Towel and chat. i started playing SWTOR to pass the time, im really enjoying it
[4:51:31] polishguy734: It’s dangerous
[4:52:00] MedicineMan: Did they say when they'll announce the new mage talent tree?
[4:52:02] Halsitgoing: can enhance use maelstorm or lava burst now?
[4:52:04] Nachozdood: Hope it stays good and isnt like Ele of the past and falls off once you clear the 1st raid

[4:52:32] Halsitgoing: on*
[4:52:40] polishguy734: I can’t decide on my second character. I’m currently shaman.
[4:52:54] polishguy734: Might use my Lvl token for a healer build.

[4:54:48] Nachozdood: you want flame shock on everything but blizz wont let you cause lavaburst tooooooo stronk
[4:55:07] Pachydactyl: yeah aoe feels like just chain lightning and eq
[4:55:09] polishguy734: Ya, that would be cool. I still haven’t maxed my shaman yet, I’m 54. But I want to have 2 maxed out before expansion
[4:55:24] Architank: make a flameshock mouse over, easy peezy
[4:55:25] Hood______: after a certain number it's probably more dps efficient to forgo the flameshocks
[4:55:25] ProjectSevan: @polishguy734 with the exp buff you could level a few and see which you like the best
[4:55:39] polishguy734: Single target = beast. AOE = not so beast
[4:55:59] Mecabeast: stone legion
[4:56:30] polishguy734: @projectsevan good idea, I haven’t even thought of the buffs.

[4:57:45] Architank: ugh oribos WutFace ... Kappa

[4:58:40] Pexaan: @Nachozdood Kreygasm
[4:58:55] Pexaan: and the sound effect with lava burst is so satisfying
[4:58:56] gregl__: @polishguy734 yes
[4:59:05] gregl__: you pick up engi and alchemy and leave them at level 1
[4:59:07] gregl__: and go next
[4:59:08] Sollice: @polishguy734 Not useless, but in the upcoming expansion it will be completely redone

[5:01:10] ManlioJorgeGrimaldi: the music is too high
[5:01:15] Rudric_Ice: hunters are boring dont play em play warriors like a real CHAD

[5:06:56] Rudric_Ice: Deathwing comes back and help us kill Galakarond POGGERS
[5:06:58] polishguy734: Remember doing Ony and you would start that battle in storm wind? Best thing to do was send a Mob to the AH

[5:18:16] Hypertitan: might have been activision as a whole with all their mobile games or something
[5:18:16] Architank: They may not have wanted wrath to be buried by all the Alpha hype so they "leaked" a release date
[5:18:18] TombStoneMercenary: Has pc immortal gotten out of early access yet?

[5:19:14] Architank: 50% XP means my level 12 pally will be shooting up
[5:19:16] Dankind64: hey @Towelliee do you have a wow community for M+ and Raid PUGs?
[5:19:17] Mr_Underpants: the buff
[5:19:19] Clicklesly: Will the fresh servers have the xp buff too?
[5:19:22] Sollice: I guess I can turn off the alpha command
[5:19:29] Darwoo: @mayonaes when pre patch starts I think
[5:19:37] RobbayGames: @Clicklesly I belive so yes
[5:19:48] Sollice: k
[5:19:54] Rudric_Ice: i heard max say that he might switch to alliance or was that a fluff ?
[5:20:23] king_julian_96: did'nt blizz say there is goign to be 6 phases of alpha which after that iam assuming they will go into beta
[5:20:27] mayonaes: You can level 1-60 in 10 hours
[5:20:30] mayonaes: with the 50%
[5:20:31] texquil: TBC buff should of been 100%
[5:20:31] Nice_n_Dicey: any idea how many fresh servers will be released?
[5:20:33] Holysal: @Vanguard771 its up on na now. just checked
[5:20:33] Korupcija_: it's 0.5x faster
[5:20:36] mayonaes: just questing
[5:20:42] garyoldmann: it was good in Retail, lvled to 60 in like 15hrs
[5:20:43] blooodraine: @Towelliee  just coming back to twitch and gaming atm are you playing dragonflight alpha or is this for wrath?
[5:20:45] Mitune: I mean being alliance doesnt change how that guild works
[5:20:47] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:20:55] TombStoneMercenary: Would rather have them put LFD in Wrath instead of 50% leveling buff in tbc
[5:20:55] mavericks312: i mean max switching isnt a big of a deal since he isnt actually in the raid is it?
[5:20:56] Dankind64: @Towelliee do you have a wow community for M+ and Raid PUGs?
[5:21:01] TheCheeseWheel87: I think Lux finished the majority of the w/a's for Wrath. just has a few loose ends to clean up then should start sharing them.
[5:21:05] Moobot: @Stark__HS Tanks For Alpha is a non-profit org to help fill the void for lack of an Evoker Tank spec in Dragonflight. Helping men and women of WoW get faster queues. Our emotional support Bears will help ease the pain of queues for players around the world.
[5:21:09] PhillyDilly18: I think it will help more than people realize. Especially for elite and dungeon quests that already award a lot of exp
[5:21:12] Stangin2122: TBCC just got the 50% XP buff
[5:21:16] DoritoGaming_: XP buff live

[5:21:24] looney199725: dwarf racial bis for high keys
[5:21:40] TombStoneMercenary: As far as I know it does not work yet
[5:21:51] king_julian_96: well surely with the next phase blizz wil lsend another wave of invites to peopel to the alpha
[5:21:55] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 not just max the whole guild
[5:22:06] king_julian_96: so there is not an issue of finding people
[5:22:07] greekttv: do you think you will be moving away from elv with the direction blizzard is going with the UI
[5:22:16] Shadowlemur01: honestly they need xfaction guilds on all but rp realms i think
[5:22:24] Clawanorder: XP buff live
[5:22:25] manmower: with the new UI, I think addons are dead
[5:22:35] DecayedmiNt: Lmao

[5:22:39] mavericks312: @Rudric_Ice ah ok that would be interesting but just max alone not so much
[5:22:39] DecayedmiNt: Not even close
[5:22:40] charlie_the_snowman: smoke dat kush
[5:22:41] manmower: hehe
[5:22:44] Mitune: Well isnt this UI not fully implemented ?
[5:22:45] emznev: Never liked Elvui i love the new ui
[5:22:47] Cakeabsorber: KEKW

[5:22:49] looney199725: copium
[5:22:54] mavericks312: listen no one is giving up there elvui for the new frames stop it
[5:22:55] fewyn: can i have whatever they are smoking that thinks addons are dead?
[5:22:55] zwebbyb: @manmower ??????
[5:22:56] darbuthetank: new ui is just bartender???
[5:22:57] Two_Headed_Raven: LUL
[5:22:59] Kisswani: towCopium no more addons
[5:22:59] abracka_: i personally can't stand elvui anymore, too many bugs breaking the UI requiring a reload
[5:22:59] paprickan: addons overrated
[5:23:04] keeindordel: weeed <3
[5:23:05] Darwoo: yeah enver liked Elvui
[5:23:08] Tamz_tv: There's some cursed takes in here
[5:23:09] manmower: I was channeling my WoW UI designer during the staff meeting
[5:23:10] cahoots82: yeah, bartender is all it seems like
[5:23:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's more than bartender
[5:23:14] ProjectSevan: @Clawanorder retail or BC?
[5:23:15] AwelessOne: race to world first done with default ui
[5:23:16] Shrapnel_Sponge: aww i missed a silly question LUL
[5:23:19] emznev: addons are for simps just like me :)
[5:23:20] asmodai4823: some lfr takes in here
[5:23:26] vic_ave: ppl smoking that ZaZa
[5:23:33] DecayedmiNt: @AwelessOne Some of them actually use default with just weakauras
[5:23:37] Shadowlemur01: Im gonna dump it when it DF launches tbh, Im not a super power user or anything so the modern ui should be fine for me
[5:23:39] manmower: they should do a purist RWF, no addons
[5:23:45] keeindordel: but @Towelliee  u can make ur mini map bigger tho! Pepehand
[5:23:46] Mitune: Honestly, they would be probably happy not to deal with addons
[5:23:47] Shrapnel_Sponge: tbh I'd love a RWF no addons LUL
[5:23:48] abracka_: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dungeon-armor-models-in-dragonflight-327886
[5:23:49] zwebbyb: mEh weakauras overRatEd
[5:23:51] asmodai4823: gl doing m jailer without WA
[5:23:51] wesosdqueso: no combatLogs either
[5:23:57] Pwoahv: Have they mentioned what alpha build will have the rest of the UI?
[5:24:05] Clawanorder: @ProjectSevan TBC
[5:24:14] keeindordel: we want the mini map to be smaller!
[5:24:16] cahoots82: What is "dealing" with addons? You install them, use a manager and that's the extent of "dealing" with them
[5:24:30] darbuthetank: curse forge op
[5:24:31] warchiefsnow: *coughs* dry herb vaping not even sure who you are or how i got here
[5:24:34] BlewGamingGroup: trying to be like the guild blind in wrath that tells people that they cant use any addons including weakauras and dbm ... no thanks
[5:24:53] Cakeabsorber: Dont even need to close the game, download addons hit a /reload ez pz
[5:24:55] DecayedmiNt: Wonder what the verdict on Curseforge is now that it's been out for a bit now
[5:25:00] greekttv: tbh Elv causes me as many issues as it solves early into patches, was more asking once its fully done. I'll still be using addons but Elv can blow
[5:25:02] Rudric_Ice: ban combat addons blizz :)
[5:25:19] schneid4: they arent banning addons get over it
[5:25:32] Tamz_tv: Weakauras blew my mind the first time I saw them
[5:25:32] manmower: they should stop all of the CD tracking addons in pvp
[5:25:35] warchiefsnow: my personal opinon *coughs* make WoW 2? Starcraft MMO? Diablo MMO without ruining them all with RMT
[5:25:39] paprickan: @Rudric_Ice TRUE
[5:25:47] warchiefsnow: its time
[5:25:47] Cakeabsorber: I'd be down to remove DBM and such though
[5:25:50] feydrinpal: Let the addons do the raid for u :)
[5:25:52] king_julian_96: towelliee did blizz say what there going to do after the 6th phase of the alpha cause i thought blizz said they realesing all the alpha content in 6 phases so if true woudl that mean after 6 weeks we get beta or no
[5:25:53] darbuthetank: starcraft mmo plz blizzard
[5:26:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: banning addons? you think you but you dont
[5:26:10] Aquadriel: go play ff14 if you dont want combat addons bro kekw
[5:26:14] fewyn: you think you want it but you really dont
[5:26:15] Aidler: addons are simply a part of the WoW experience
[5:26:17] japoleon: off topic. What are you vaping good sir ? Iv'e got nutty vanilla tobacco in my little stealthy pod mod.
[5:26:21] Frank4LuLz: love SPY add-on, ganking me some lowbies
[5:26:22] manmower: @darbuu don't give them ideas, they're gonna make Starcraft Immortal
[5:26:23] akrus_warr: without addons we go back to the zzzz style of bosses "tank mob here, dispell debuff repeat for 5mins"
[5:26:33] luckfore: so beta in a month Pog
[5:26:45] Nachozdood: FF Andys want addons gone :P
[5:26:45] Llamatude: i heard method banned elvui
[5:26:48] DecayedmiNt: Imagine Illidan without blockchinese.
[5:26:51] darbuthetank: @manmower you right
[5:26:52] Funderik: the people saying ban addons are the same people that want mythic gear without stepping into a raid.
[5:26:55] Cakeabsorber: @akrus_warr What kind of take is this? KEKW
[5:27:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: They can't tell who is winning without damage meters
[5:27:04] remixonfire91: @Nachozdood wdym lol i play ff and i cant play without plugins and ACT addons
[5:27:07] abracka_: @Llamatude it has a tendency to break requiring a ui reload
[5:27:10] mavericks312: ppl who want doons removed want mythic gear for free
[5:27:12] keeindordel: they will jsut do the FF14 treatment, ull have it but its bannable if u link dps meters Kappa @Towelliee
[5:27:13] akrus_warr: @akrus_warr blizzard have even said themselfs that addons allow them to crerate complex boss mechanics
[5:27:15] paravak: Allow addons in normal and heroic raids, block addons in mythic. Ultimate RWF should be going in bareback.
[5:27:17] Dark_lite7: Surely this new UI with additional add ons like DBM, Plater, WeakAuras etc would still be good though? the new UI is at least going in the right direction.
[5:27:22] Ezekyler: i need ATT addons to play properly towCopium
[5:27:24] luckfore: towStop towIt
[5:27:25] manmower: they should just design fights to not require addons
[5:27:27] Llamatude: @Mint_Fanatic go alliance on illidan.. no issues lol. No one talks!
[5:27:28] wesosdqueso: the game is about setting up the UI gameplay is secondary LUL
[5:27:29] mabexo: Hey Towelliee, can you help me by letting me know how Dragon flying will work as a druid? Will flight form not be used anymore then?
[5:27:31] Mitune: addons are fine just the extent of what WA does is the problem
[5:27:35] Tamz_tv: computational
[5:27:38] cahoots82: the Among Us one
[5:27:45] DecayedmiNt: @Llamatude Am Alliance on Illidan lol
[5:27:48] Roydze: Only way it would work is if wow made some base addons in game. Then disabled all third party
[5:27:51] darbuthetank: @Towelliee i use to never use anything besides detials and dbm...after using weakauras and plater and acouple other addons
[5:27:52] Funderik: banning addons would mean half the game not working, they already explained this
[5:27:53] greekttv: WAs and simplistic in same sentance
[5:27:53] Llamatude: @Mint_Fanatic same! lol
[5:27:54] darbuthetank: i cant live without t
[5:28:05] Mitune: I mean the Anduin addon
[5:28:07] charlie_the_snowman: Here is a more important question though: How was your shit this morning Towelliee?
[5:28:07] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[5:28:08] asmodai4823: WA carrys alot of fights
[5:28:10] Llamatude: @Mint_Fanatic i went alliance after we could cross faction
[5:28:11] manmower: without addons nobody would clear mythic
[5:28:17] cahoots82: There was one that lasted like 3 days that essentially did it for you
[5:28:18] DecayedmiNt: @Llamatude Same
[5:28:21] maidenhaur: you would think they learned from mekkatorque
[5:28:25] BlewGamingGroup: @Mitune  anything weakauras does .... dbm probably does it already and weakauras does it better
[5:28:28] cahoots82: but agreed, that mechanic was ass
[5:28:41] Darwoo: do they create raids with add ons in mind?
[5:28:44] Ezekyler: "design flaw" well, that's Shadowlands in a nutshell
[5:28:51] darbuthetank: @Darwoo prob
[5:28:58] ZavhenGhorr: Hey @Towelliee do we know how many invites go out for like tomorrow for Alpha? Really want to help test and I want to play Preservation Evoker
[5:29:06] keeindordel: the ppl tht dont want add-ons are bad players lets be honest @Towelliee  Kappa
[5:29:11] DecayedmiNt: They dont get invited to pugs without addons tho Kappa
[5:29:11] drewetling: you play your game ill play mine with addons
[5:29:14] manmower: it's fine, as long as warcraftlogs tracks no addons vs addons
[5:29:15] User3600: no
[5:29:19] akia03: but but i want my lovely addons
[5:29:19] falldrgn: its your sub play how you want..
[5:29:20] shupering: both having a good time? unacceptable
[5:29:20] Funderik: wow without elvui sounds so gross to me
[5:29:22] TombStoneMercenary: How dare someone use something I dont like!!!
[5:29:22] charlie_the_snowman: BOTH?!?!? thats insanity
[5:29:25] Suligane: how dare you have fun
[5:29:26] luckfore: blizz should ban the complainers LUL
[5:29:26] mabexo: Hey Towelliee I am a druid, can you help me by letting me know how Dragon flying will work as a druid? Will flight form not be used anymore then?
[5:29:27] SensationalBanana: "Addons are what's keeping me from doing Mythic raiding boohoo :("
[5:29:29] keeindordel: they blame add-ons for reasons y they ge tkciked out of raids Kappa
[5:29:31] Llamatude: @Towelliee NO you must play the game the way i do or ill REEEE all over the place!
[5:29:33] manmower: hehe
[5:29:35] king_julian_96: towelliee why are you surprised it's the same no changes to classic nonsense so why did you expect any different towelliee
[5:29:37] Mitune: I like base ui but I have always used it
[5:29:37] MetYoYO25: no deal
[5:29:39] Architank: It wouldn't be problem if blizzard didn't design raids around addon usage.
[5:29:40] falldrgn: @manmower There is no way that could be tracked.
[5:29:41] sentokiisarg87: My addons my choice!
[5:29:42] Hood______: Just needs more customizability
[5:29:43] Darwoo: so if they create content with addons in mind why not just implenet the systems in game
[5:29:45] Xtops: Shadowlnads had  AVR  addon be possible again...
[5:29:45] BlewGamingGroup: turn off your addons . make your own guild and call it <Stock UI Only> and see how long you stay in a guild of 1
[5:29:47] Dankind64: I think they will just design fights to not need intense ones anymore
[5:29:47] wyman1990vc: which elvui do you use I looked it up last night there was a ton
[5:29:47] Pexaan: people will make an addon that detects people with no addon so they don't get invited LUL
[5:29:50] Phobion: everyone enjoying, no way Kappa LUL
[5:29:52] asmodai4823: game would be better without WA but its not gonna happen
[5:29:54] manmower: addons are basically just making up for things missing in the UI
[5:29:56] Hood______: Ok that's cap, I hated their UI lol
[5:29:57] TheItalianStallion321: addons is why i dont sub to WoW. BAN ADDONS! kek fuckin W
[5:29:59] luckfore: ff ui sucks
[5:30:05] greekttv: I disagree i hate FF UI
[5:30:06] Unciatim: translation,  don't pls on my Wheaties and I won't S* on your steak
[5:30:07] luckfore: so fugly
[5:30:10] Junebug_VR: I think for me the only addons that shouldn't exist are the ones that affect game design. lol
[5:30:12] king_julian_96: speaking of ffxiv 6.2 is comign out in august aswells
[5:30:12] KydSage: ff ui is good you can change anything you want

[5:30:21] charlie_the_snowman: ff ui is good
[5:30:24] Shrapnel_Sponge: do you feel the same way about the new DF ui or is it still bad?
[5:30:26] kosatbf: ffxiv might be the worse UI i've ever seen. Strange that people can have such different experiences
[5:30:27] Jawis: my dad went to get new addons.. he never returned peepoSad
[5:30:30] xALcaPWNedx: swtor UI is the most user friendly lol
[5:30:31] Codad: ff's ui is fuctionally fine and you can complete content with it. it's just ugly
[5:30:32] Sollice: Man you all are some opiniated motherfuckers
[5:30:33] antphilosophy: indie company
[5:30:37] Truthseeker96: wait why is there a log out countdown inside Org on retail?
[5:30:38] asmodai4823: how is ff14 ui bad
[5:30:39] User3600: addons make blizzard lazy , ppl who lack addons get usually outplayed The addons do everything for the person instread of playing the game and learning , thats the core problem of it
[5:30:40] SensationalBanana: I wonder which content creator put the anti-addon crap into the parrot people now parroting the talking point all over WoW social media...
[5:30:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: SWTOR has had a UI editor built into the game for a loooong time
[5:30:43] schneid4: addons allow blizz to do less work
[5:30:43] theSalute: LMAO
[5:30:43] BlewGamingGroup: @Shrapnel_Sponge DF stock still sucks
[5:30:44] asmodai4823: its straight up better than wows lol
[5:30:50] Dark_lite7: So do you not think this new UI, although unfinished at the moment, will win anyone over? @Towelliee still too limited?
[5:31:00] manmower: there are addons that tell you where to move, when to move, what buttons to press, it's great
[5:31:02] Ezekyler: SWTOR UI editor is really good
[5:31:05] GamingDad77: @Sollice Opinions are like asshols. everyone has one..lul
[5:31:13] SensationalBanana: @User3600 Tell me you don't know what you're talking about, without TELLING me...

[5:31:45] Llamatude: Lol ill keep my WA and out play anyone who plays with stock any day! i can see things faster then they can..
[5:31:46] Frank4LuLz: *NEWSFLASH*.... Blue Post, Blizzard Bans Add-ons.... thank you Blizzard.... towCopium
[5:31:50] falldrgn: if Echo or Method just used DBM and whatever UI mod they want.. they would still clear
[5:31:56] SensationalBanana: "I'm only bad at the game because I refuse addons playing the game for me!" hurr durr.
[5:31:59] OnePlayerPete: Have you seen the dungeon armour sets?
[5:32:00] mavericks312: @doomkry its called git gud as ion would put it lol

[5:32:02] xALcaPWNedx: how about an addon that just plays the game for me? lol sheesh these people
[5:32:02] Trollhat: a problem with their design i'd say
[5:32:10] tornbraclet: the wow ui is getting better than when the game started. it might take them a few more years to get to FF or SWToR state
[5:32:14] manmower: pretty sure the Social Contract says you promise not to use addons to make other players feel bad
[5:32:22] User3600: @SensationalBanana Tell me how to arena for ppl who doesnt know or want to get CD trackers/gladius/ Omnibars / cast bar Dbuff tracker , tell me you lack logic or knowladge without telling me
[5:32:22] greekttv: Do bombs w/o a WA lol
[5:32:31] asmodai4823: bombs would be fucked on jailer without WA
[5:32:33] Jaren475: @Towelliee I've always wondered, and never worked it out even after getting it, but, what that weakauras actually do?
[5:32:34] Codad: those fights are literally designed with dbm and weakaura in mind in modern day wow
[5:32:37] DoubleNova: I play without any UI Kappa
[5:32:41] Frank4LuLz: that chinese guild, Cream-of-sun-guy, they did it
[5:32:42] doomkry: what avr addon are ppl talking about being used during shadowlands?
[5:32:45] Shrapnel_Sponge: I was blown away by the legally blind WoW raid guild that have AotC Jailer, and they got it before all the nerfs
[5:32:52] SensationalBanana: @User3600 Lmao, sure, the addons is why you struggle.
[5:32:53] asmodai4823: yea and all 5 ppl go to right place
[5:32:58] manmower: without addons, could that blind guild clear the raids?
[5:33:24] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee do we think the patch will be a poop shoot like last week?
[5:33:26] Hypertitan: they did
[5:33:30] wesosdqueso: and killed in that 0.1 sec it takes you to check. Game is too fast nowadays.
[5:33:30] king_julian_96: towelliee i juts realised we got a shit load of stuff to do next month sl season 4 wrath prepatch dragonflight beta late next month and ffxiv patch 6.2 atleast for me anyway enought to keep me busy to actul dragonflight realese for sure
[5:33:32] keeindordel: blind?
[5:33:35] dym_jt: They should just disable DBM and BigWigs and stop overcomplicating boss encounters.
[5:33:35] geokouts: is xp boost live in NA classic servers now?
[5:33:36] keeindordel: u mean DEAF!?
[5:33:36] manmower: they cleared it before most of us =/
[5:33:36] dannyis1337: they should make servers thats dont allow addons
[5:33:37] TheItalianStallion321: there is a deaf guild, not blind
[5:33:41] Mecabeast: I think he means the deaf guild
[5:33:41] jeflag: deaf guild
[5:33:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: i thougt it was a deaf guild
[5:33:43] Codad: i thought they were deaf
[5:33:44] keeindordel: a blind person isnt going to play WoW
[5:33:45] Mr_Underpants: what? A blind guild? What difficulty
[5:33:46] Pexaan: blind guild?
[5:33:48] TheCheeseWheel87: Blind? i thought it was deaf
[5:33:50] Lazugo: !TFA

[5:33:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats a big difference
[5:33:54] R2RHIN0: how would healing work in a blind guild?
[5:33:56] OmgItsEdizzle: deaf guild... undaunted
[5:33:57] Xtops: @doomkry there was one used to draw all projectiles as lanes augmented  i have a screenshot video got deletedd
[5:33:58] charlie_the_snowman: blind AND deaf guys
[5:34:00] greekttv: Blind is half my raid team sometimes
[5:34:01] Pexaan: wait that is cool, didn't know such a thing existed
[5:34:02] Hypertitan: i knew a blind wow player
[5:34:05] Llamatude: they got AOTC not CE
[5:34:07] SensationalBanana: I've heard of blind players but not entirely blind guilds.
[5:34:08] TheItalianStallion321: i forgot their name but there is a deaf guild i think that cleared Castle Nathria
[5:34:17] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Llamatude Still an amazing achievement
[5:34:22] Shrenko: exp buff live on NA for wotlk now
[5:34:24] DeleldurTV: https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/news/joyous-journeys-experience-buff-now-live-on-na-realms-327968?webhook
[5:34:31] Llamatude: no i agree.. People where saying they got CE
[5:34:33] king_julian_96: i think being deaf is worse then being blind
[5:34:33] snakeyy0_0: @towelliee do you still raid mythic competitively?
[5:34:33] User3600: @SensationalBanana Dude i am 2.3k i am not complaining that i am stuggling or not , i am using the addons . its the reason to put all at even playing field without needing 3rd party stuff to get into the game to be on par with other ppl thats all , other mmos allow only recounts wow got addons that change your gameplay and turn off your brain like DBM even for example
[5:34:36] king_julian_96: in my opinion
[5:34:37] DeleldurTV: how about some EU love?
[5:34:38] Shrapnel_Sponge: I know loads of guilds that still don't have AotC even after the nerfs LUL
[5:34:38] DeleldurTV: sir
[5:34:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: blind is half of the community thinking blizzard will ban addons
[5:34:52] Shrenko: EU 😭
[5:34:57] brian_777777777: not anymore
[5:35:00] GamingDad77: @HaxzorJimDuggan deaf is the other half
[5:35:14] doomkry: @Xtops oh yeah i remember watching that clip

[5:35:25] Pr1m0x21: Wassup
[5:35:29] DeleldurTV: @Towelliee  i linked the wowhead post XP buff live on US
[5:35:33] alatryste: could you show your talent build?
[5:35:40] darkvager: what if then do raid like the dungeon black out have to use a light to hit the target
[5:35:41] Streamcrush: Blizz has banned addons they felt went too far in trivializing the game
[5:35:42] Mecabeast: what is mombo kekw
[5:35:47] SensationalBanana: @User3600 Again, you've shown that you don't know what you're talking about. There is no addon that can make up for skill, hence why so very few can down bosses whilst current even with addons. /done with you.
[5:35:54] darkvager: tank has to use it
[5:35:54] Streamcrush: and they restrict a lot more from addons than they used to
[5:36:03] BlackCl0ud: how you liking the new talents?
[5:36:07] doomkry: #bcplayersmatter :(
[5:36:17] king_julian_96: how hard do you think the fated raids will be next week towelliee SL season 4 launches
[5:36:20] BlackCl0ud: can't wait also to try them
[5:36:30] greekttv: just over here leveling ever class in SL out of pure boredom
[5:36:32] stabzmcgeee: is it havoc dh easy?
[5:36:38] Hypertitan: @SensationalBanana I mean...the jailer bomb WA i would say does exactly that haha
[5:36:42] Llamatude: I was in queue the other day for 2 hours for got i was in queue lol
[5:36:55] fewyn: man AVR was great
[5:36:56] Dystilled: AVR was hilarious
[5:36:57] GiraffeHydra_: give me alpha, blizz. I'll queue tank
[5:36:58] Frank4LuLz: SPY
[5:37:09] wyman1990vc: @greekttv I just got my last class to 60 last night man spammed dungeons out of boredom

[5:37:14] Se7enthSinn: I hate how Blizz gave up on shadowlands when there are still a lot of people playing that dont have access to the alpha
[5:37:16] Pexaan: @greekttv @greekttv how are the queues in SL with leveling like dungeons? thinking of playing SL for the first time but hesitant
[5:37:17] BlewGamingGroup: see what you do is .. run both of your alphas and have one in queue while the other one is doing dungeons
[5:37:24] fewyn: i only killed lich king because of AVR
[5:37:34] SensationalBanana: @king_julian_96 I'm not even sure if they've tested fated raids...
[5:37:37] fewyn: yeah it did
[5:37:38] king_julian_96: don't talk about more invites towelliee i still have'nt gotten my alpha invite
[5:37:41] Xtops: it  had !
[5:37:46] Mr_Underpants: fester fuck hahah
[5:37:46] fewyn: because of the pools
[5:37:50] phipsinger: what was AVR again?
[5:37:50] Dystilled: I thought they did the whole ICC in AVR?
[5:37:53] Darwoo: starting wrath fresh servers will we need to do TBC content?
[5:37:53] greekttv: I level through story b/c I don't want to pay attention
[5:37:53] Mecabeast: lichking was just the saronite bomb glitch right
[5:37:57] SensationalBanana: @Hypertitan And yet, nobody's gotten a Jailer kill for free unless they paid for it.
[5:37:57] abracka_: saronite bombs here we go
[5:38:04] User3600: @SensationalBanana Nah dude again what is you showing is you lacking any logic behind your words . i dont raid i dont PVE besides mythic + mount from the achiv . you dont even try to understand the core of it i told you take example arena without Gladius/CD tracker for enemy/Omnibars and all DR trackers and those 3rd party addons you need to get to be able to Play a core game is not good for the game specialy for new ppl. the game should have Those addons Built into the game becouse without them

[5:38:16] Dystilled: @phipsinger A mod that literally coloured the ground telling you where to stand etc, held your hand through encounters
[5:38:16] charlie_the_snowman: Fester Fuck.
[5:38:18] Holysal: @king_julian_96 im taking your spot EZ
[5:38:42] luckfore: paragraph andies monkaS
[5:38:42] GamingDad77: @Darwoo Yes. you will start at lvl 1
[5:38:46] Karnivor___: when is the dragonflight beta?
[5:38:51] greekttv: Star Auger changed WAs forever
[5:39:01] Dystilled: Didnt AVR take a heap of file changing etc to install?
[5:39:01] Hypertitan: @SensationalBanana that's still doesn't discount the fact that it's still a ridiculous WA.  I have nothing against WA's but they go a little far sometimes rendering some mechanics pointless is all
[5:39:07] king_julian_96: 4 weeks
[5:39:09] SensationalBanana: I remember that addon! It made my FPS drop to 1.
[5:39:29] Llamatude: @Towelliee what you think we will get tomorrow?
[5:39:38] stabzmcgeee: i know its abit different this time but wasnt SL beta like a month after alhpa went down
[5:39:44] Architank: This chat is so diverse. we've got mythic raiders who use the latest and greatest add-ons and healers who refuse to dps Kappa
[5:39:49] abracka_: paladin towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:39:53] king_julian_96: no but that would make the most sense thouigh towelliee if they plan to realese dragonflight this year
[5:39:54] temp3st98: yes please
[5:39:57] wyman1990vc: pally and mage pls
[5:39:59] Dystilled: Im looking at AVR pics on google. Man I forgot how bad it was haha
[5:40:00] Llamatude: cool.. this week was meh for me.. i did everything in like 1 day.. got all my reports in.
[5:40:18] akia03: normal version of starting zone or the max lvl version?
[5:40:20] luckfore: they actually have a schedule now which is a yuuge improvement
[5:40:21] greekttv: The game is also way more polished than SL alpha
[5:40:22] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: did you check out the Dungeon Armor Models in Dragonflight
[5:40:30] phipsinger: @Towelliee how did you feeling about 10.0 change from before alpha to now?
[5:40:44] convrge: Oh man I remember AVR
[5:40:49] SensationalBanana: @greekttv Really? That's promising I have to say!
[5:40:55] king_julian_96: so if beta starts in 4 to 5 weeks  how long of a beta do we have like 3 months then a reales in novemeber
[5:41:00] Hypertitan: I hated AVR so much...my guild used it and it just annoyed the shit out of me
[5:41:00] king_julian_96: realese
[5:41:11] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee did you play God of War 2018?
[5:41:19] MoonChocolates: lol
[5:41:56] Xailen: They removed avr just to add them to evokers LUL
[5:41:59] Pexaan: now just need an addon that walked and used abilities for you
[5:42:02] SensationalBanana: Nostalgia just amped up to 11. That addon was horrible though.
[5:42:19] greekttv: @SensationalBanana They have every zone finished just  slow releasing them. That has not been the case in any other alpha
[5:42:29] Dystilled: Ive got an AVR vid
[5:42:32] abracka_: arcane mage in wrath go brrrrrrrrrrrr
[5:42:33] mavericks312: no dps class was touching arcane back then
[5:42:36] Dystilled: thats the one
[5:42:39] Hypertitan: i seen a couple arcane missiles in there
[5:42:45] Jaren475: okay, that looks like a damn helpful addon for noobs like me, is there an addon that does that now?
[5:42:47] Architank: Blizzard started designing around these add-ons and world first guilds. Game got too hard for a vast majority of the playerbase.
[5:42:52] SensationalBanana: @greekttv Thank you for the info, that's actually a great change from the way they've done testing before! <3
[5:43:01] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee I had a healer friend that macro'd every ability to dispel the arcane blast buff off our mage. I can still hear his raging in my dreams
[5:43:11] ChrisStoll: 10k heals whoa holy stat squish

[5:43:25] Dystilled: It is, theres just not a lot to begin with
[5:43:42] Pexaan: @GiraffeHydra that is evil LUL
[5:43:44] DecayedmiNt: Peak addon performance was Sco's UI
[5:43:50] Ezekyler: that 4:3 aspect Kreygasm
[5:44:01] Diamondead1: KEKW
[5:44:07] DecayedmiNt: Pretty sure its been screenshotted
[5:44:07] Daemoos6: The nostalgia...
[5:44:07] charlie_the_snowman: what year was this
[5:44:09] Xailen: I will admit, that addon was pretty cool
[5:44:11] mavericks312: ice block right before the stun and keep blowing him up lol
[5:44:25] Pachydactyl: it was so hard to see the gaps though without it, they started actually designing better visuals into boss abilities after this
[5:44:32] manmower: yea, no way a modern mythic guild could beat this
[5:44:45] darklegend321: What is AVR
[5:44:47] darklegend321: ?
[5:44:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: my guild never used it back then
[5:44:57] Dystilled: Only ever made sense for healers who were whack a moling their bars
[5:45:01] mavericks312: i never knew this addon existed
[5:45:04] GiraffeHydra_: @Pexaan It really was, I think he ran up and melee'd the boss for higher dps at one point lol
[5:45:04] fewyn: FF14 telegraphs attacks like that
[5:45:09] darklegend321: Or what does it stand for even lol

[5:45:57] DeathLV: what was AVR? Played on privates WotLK for a long time, never heard of that one
[5:45:58] Dystilled: I remember when it hit the WoW fan pages it was a week later it got banned
[5:46:04] charlie_the_snowman: your layout is pretty dope
[5:46:04] Se7enthSinn: back then we use elitestjerks for info
[5:46:08] manmower: what's the point of designing a cool encounter if an addon just trivializes it?
[5:46:12] HaloS23: AVR?
[5:46:32] DecayedmiNt: Wonder if the API would even allow it to happen
[5:46:32] zanches98: whats happening??
[5:46:47] flamekaster: still got hit xD
[5:46:48] SensationalBanana: We used it for like a week and it was boring as hell.
[5:46:53] chend_yoz: that guy died anyway
[5:46:53] Hypertitan: ad people still got hit :P
[5:46:54] Dystilled: This is actually pretty tame  for what AVR did
[5:46:57] Hypertitan: and*
[5:47:04] Diamondead1: people called it haxxor
[5:47:05] Zuhbuumafu: Zuhbuumafu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[5:47:13] zanches98: whats happening?
[5:47:16] zanches98: whats the addon
[5:47:19] Clicklesly: I mean, here it's basically just adding Projected textures to an anbility
[5:47:24] greekttv: did you see the video where it was showing lines for the black knock up orbs on 2nd boss in SoA
[5:47:27] Pachydactyl: they admitted that boss abilities needed better visuals when they banned it though
[5:47:33] Hypertitan: it also played a really ridiculous horn sound didn't it??
[5:47:37] Kuzzo99: the WA for lords of dread that made the among us phase as easy as a click of a button
[5:47:51] mavericks312: fail mages didnt block before stun lol
[5:48:03] fewyn: i just died a lot period but i was bad back then... i still am
[5:48:08] Korupcija_: only reason I don't wanna play wrath are run backs after the wipe
[5:48:14] greekttv: Spires of Ascension
[5:48:20] Kainiee: werent there also crazy addons for mythic archimonde?
[5:48:31] doomkry: i can link it if you wanna see it
[5:48:32] Ezekyler: i wonder if ICC will be harder on Classic, that raid was live for a year
[5:48:50] mavericks312: @Ezekyler nah it will be cleared in under an hr
[5:48:52] looney199725: no
[5:48:56] SensationalBanana: @Ezekyler Going by every other Classic raid, no.
[5:49:00] looney199725: players are miles better than back then
[5:49:01] Se7enthSinn: it will be much easier
[5:49:03] abracka_: just you wait streamer, wotlk is going to be harder than retail
[5:49:09] Hypertitan: no...it'll be cleared the same day it comes out guaranteed
[5:49:15] fewyn: oh yeah i forgot about heroic attempts was a thing
[5:49:16] CommanderKrano: how was the name of the dude that made really good WAs for tbc and wotlk?
[5:49:17] Nanonaps: people in wrath still sucked compared to today's standard
[5:49:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Unless they tune Wrath things up, it will all be easier

[5:49:43] Cyb3rdawg: what are you going to play? prot pally?
[5:49:44] Ezekyler: they want to make Naxx harder, maybe do that with the rest of the raids, but it will be cleared  the first day i agree with that
[5:49:53] P4RT1CLEM4N: I've tried Luxthos WA, but I still just look at my action bars. Lol

[5:52:34] DogShep: What do you think about the ilvl insanity for season 4? Isn't most of the fated gear close to level 70 gear in DF?
[5:52:36] Sorraxe: @HaxzorJimDuggan maybe your right, but then again i think it will be the top players who will gather their alts together with other ppl for gear, but not the casual one
[5:52:39] Dystilled: This is pretty much how the OW2 beta went, everyone playing the new tank so Heal/DPS queues were through the roof
[5:52:45] mavericks312: @schneid4 wrath started the casualization of WoW nothing is classic from there on out
[5:52:50] Darwoo: whats the best healer to play in wrath?
[5:53:01] greekttv: @Darwoo pally
[5:53:18] DogShep: That's the hope! A fun season will be a good break. Just weird to ignore a lot of gear while leveling... even more so than before with mythic raid gear
[5:53:29] schneid4: @mavericks312 doesnt mean they still wouldnt make a profit on keeping it going
[5:54:07] Agronair: Isn't that how it usually goes though? heroic/mythic gear usually doesn't get replaced until after you hit max level and start running heroics?
[5:54:07] grizzlyhorn: where warrior talents FeelsBadMan
[5:54:13] looney199725: its gonna be funny when or if they ever get back to classic sl in future and people are hyped for it
[5:54:19] Dystilled: @Towelliee scene change?
[5:54:20] Kyrrua: somehow I stopped cared about world firsts classic after jokerD and Ragnaros. theres no thrill
[5:54:21] Fugazi811: @Towelliee can you change the viewing mode?
[5:54:58] Jaren475: @Towelliee I recall you saying earlier they'll likely make a large invite wave around phase 6 of testing, but, how do we follow what phase we're at?
[5:55:07] Kisswani: This alpha seems remarkably stable
[5:55:38] looney199725: @Jaren475 every week is a new phase tmoz is phase 3
[5:56:00] Mitchiegan: @jaren475 I think they post on Twitter. this is phase 2
[5:56:19] belaham: Any info on what the next talent tree is gonna be released is @Towelliee ?
[5:56:40] Sylhepnia: Paladin and Mage most probably
[5:56:49] SensationalBanana: Every WEEK is a new phase?? That's a lot faster than I anticipated
[5:56:49] flamekaster: its so weird looking at all that gold looting when u play tbc xD
[5:57:19] looney199725: @SensationalBanana games supposed be out in like 4 months so ye

[5:58:13] manmower: DF seems pretty far along
[5:58:13] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:58:30] Malvurak9109: @towelliee At this point what are you leveling first one dragonflight  comes out?
[5:58:43] Malvurak9109: First when*
[5:58:46] Rudric_Ice: fullscreen it mr tow
[5:59:02] manmower: probably a paladin
[5:59:15] vaironixx: yeah wrong scene @Towelliee
[5:59:21] zastin586: He wants to know which class you're leveling first in DF
[5:59:25] s_t_o_r_m__: towCopium
[5:59:26] Pexaan: he prob means what class you leveling first when expansion comes out @Towelliee
[5:59:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, which class is first
[5:59:47] saltybcn: Not sure if you care but you are in windowed mode
[5:59:50] vaironixx: lol
[5:59:54] GamingDad77: I can't believe that's even a question.
[5:59:56] schneid4: i like the ulda re work
[5:59:57] Trekxx: how does enhance feel
[5:59:57] Architank: @sensationalbanana game is coming out December, they gotta roll quickly
[6:00:05] Malvurak9109: @towelliee sorry phone fucked lol. What I was trying to ask was what are you leveling first when dragon flight comes out based on raid needs?
[6:00:10] vaironixx: hes leveling rogue first 4Head
[6:00:14] Pexaan: LUL my man dodged it like a politician
[6:00:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmaster should be first!
[6:00:25] GiraffeHydra_: warlock, def Kappa
[6:00:34] Polarisss_: frost mage for sure Kappa
[6:00:38] DecayedmiNt: It's been the same since he started streaming.
[6:00:39] LoseAlotLuke: goblin fits right in with that model city on the floor
[6:00:44] Mitchiegan: he's a priest main I think
[6:00:47] Pexaan: tauren rogue is prob what he will be going for
[6:00:56] Exoduc: Zap em SwiftRage
[6:00:57] business_man_alex: @towelliee I'm thinking of switching to enhance for DF. how does it feel?
[6:01:11] Sneakzx: Healer on the struggle bus
[6:01:21] Mitchiegan: how motto is staffs up, right?
[6:01:34] Pexaan: healing is the most stressful role
[6:01:44] ScytheLuvsYou: This TBC?
[6:01:49] ScytheLuvsYou: those numbers are insane
[6:01:58] Mitchiegan: his*

[6:02:28] DecayedmiNt: TBC with 138k health. FeelsGoodMan
[6:02:51] Kisswani: new class talents today HOPIUM ?
[6:03:49] Elseworldz: Probably tomorrow.
[6:04:16] Kisswani: I'm hoping for a preview at least
[6:04:19] schneid4: they should have made like broken/aged versions of the old bosses in here
[6:04:20] Nerendis: Inb4 wotlk prepatch drops tomorrow with no announcement.
[6:04:39] Architank: Someone needs to out a slow on the boss so he can kite him better
[6:05:15] DecayedmiNt: @schneid4 It's not the same wing of Ulduman.
[6:05:20] Hypertitan: you need to be a healer right?
[6:05:21] ogbearclaw: right green hands
[6:05:24] LeDerpski: You dont get aoe res as dps
[6:05:25] ogbearclaw: on right side of screenm
[6:05:26] vic_ave: Resto
[6:05:28] Ezekyler: mass rez is resto only
[6:05:28] tubbylicious: just restro
[6:05:28] Elseworldz: Only healers have the aoe res
[6:05:29] Poomer: AoE rez are heals only
[6:05:30] ZetYokai: its on your right bar
[6:05:31] Zayvion: aoe one is resto
[6:05:35] Hypertitan: you have a regular rez on your right bar
[6:05:36] moosc: Isn’t there any dps meters after bosses? I’ve seen it on other olaces
[6:05:52] ogbearclaw: no aoe is healers only
[6:05:56] ScottxTee: Other than the new class what DPS have you enjoyed the most so far?
[6:06:05] nvnto: aoe res are all healer specs only
[6:06:13] ArcaneSyntax: dbm what is this 2008
[6:06:31] moosc: Anyone know why the dps didn’t show after boss?
[6:06:45] ArcaneSyntax: it does not help that half the shaman cap talents don't work
[6:07:00] Nerendis: Is drac healing broken too? @towelliee
[6:07:02] zgag: I remember how op Dk's were when Wrath was first releaed
[6:07:03] Ezekyler: dude, you are a dirty goblin, how you dare to compete against a dragon? Kappa
[6:07:18] Mitchiegan: luxthoLurk
[6:07:32] LoseAlotLuke: dirty goblin
[6:07:49] zgag: Everyone making the emotes "Get over here"
[6:08:10] zgag: or macros
[6:08:37] Elseworldz: Ouch.
[6:09:25] Voiddyn: I'm glad that Drac healing is high skill floor high skill ceiling tbh.
[6:09:26] zgag: There's going to be lots of changes between here and release
[6:09:47] GroovyBryan: what class talents are you hoping to see on the next phase?
[6:10:03] Hypertitan: the ice strike hailstorm frostshock slaps holy shit
[6:10:16] Mitchiegan: ding
[6:10:25] ArcaneSyntax: I don't know if I see a world where enhance takes wft for m+.
[6:10:33] LeDerpski: Totems are the best part of shaman :(
[6:10:42] Hypertitan: honestly I wouldn't even take windfury totem for dugeons haha
[6:10:49] Mecabeast: think wf would be better if you didn't need a gcd to drop it?
[6:10:54] Architank: Sadge no totems
[6:11:02] Zwarx32: @zgag yeah thats why i think its almost a waste of time to even play it rn tbh
[6:11:06] ZetYokai: @Hypertitan does it not have a large range?
[6:11:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: grounding totem and healing stream are good to use
[6:11:39] ArcaneSyntax: @Mecabeast it's not even the gcd that's a problem, it just straight up not useful in dungeons
[6:11:42] Hypertitan: @Hypertitan it doesn't but you're only buffing 1 dps with it...you're better off taking something for personal damage
[6:11:45] V0lt4GE1: is there gonna be mass invites for tomorrows alpha?
[6:11:54] Daarksyde: Does doom winds take up a gcd?
[6:12:05] Hypertitan: @Hypertitan sry...it does have a decent range...just not worth the point in dugeons for the most part
[6:12:21] metavahn231: I'm back to good ol gw2
[6:12:43] metavahn231: eso bored me so easy
[6:13:04] Joefoshow15: how is enh feeling?
[6:13:07] Shamnator: look like some nice healing then
[6:13:14] Thoreya: targeted to me of :)
[6:13:14] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[6:13:16] Thoreya: ofc
[6:13:19] Faerlynn: What does it mean that it's targeted?
[6:13:28] jeflag: 9999 ppl
[6:13:34] Elseworldz: @elixirfield1 Yay! More people! :D
[6:13:37] Nerendis: Clip it! 10k confirmed!
[6:13:38] V0lt4GE1: prob 500 - 1k
[6:13:40] Architank: 10k would br most of wow's current population Kappa
[6:13:42] ArcaneSyntax: @Daark11 it didn't in legion i don't think
[6:13:47] apb89: Can you say what armor type class trees will be released
[6:13:53] abracka_: paladin tree today pls towCopium towCopium towCopium
[6:14:05] Mitune: Having Dragon riding back will help alot
[6:14:12] ChimmyNeutron: @Vanguard771 LUL LUL
[6:14:16] ArcaneSyntax: probably warrior tree tomorrow at least
[6:14:29] r1ftzxd: targetted to CE guilds @Towelliee ? or random
[6:14:37] manmower: did they disable dragon riding?
[6:14:43] Shrenko: @Mitune dragon riding back??
[6:14:46] zgag: Blizzard going to need to ramp up the invites more so than previous Alpha's/Beta's
[6:14:52] ZetYokai: whats new in the next phase
[6:14:54] metavahn231: gw2 is the only game with challenging world content really
[6:15:03] zgag: With such a quick turnaround release
[6:15:05] Shrenko: ^
[6:15:06] manmower: Waking Shore is the starting zone right?
[6:15:17] apb89: Ya first zone you enter
[6:15:21] apb89: Unless dracthyr
[6:15:26] manmower: probably 'how to tame your dragon'
[6:15:26] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:15:34] giggz91: When are we getting more talent trees?
[6:15:48] V0lt4GE1: you mean "how to train your dragon" :P
[6:16:03] blooodraine: what ya think @Towelliee  is dragonflight gonna be bigger lvling wise then what we had with shadowlands?
[6:16:17] manmower: seems like the dragons come pre-trained and know how to fly
[6:16:31] V0lt4GE1: didnt blizz state they want a bigger lvling time than SL?
[6:16:36] manmower: gently used, make sure you check the CarFox report before you buy
[6:16:39] zgag: Imo, Blizzard should have forgone the F&F stuff like in the past and sent out a huge wave to start off this Alpha.  They don't need the marketing stuff per say .  They need to hit this xpac out of the ballpark
[6:16:50] smashwow: evokers now able to be in combat in their human form?!
[6:16:51] mavericks312: whats the chances toothless is available at launch lol
[6:17:03] V0lt4GE1: I think alpha is just basic testing that nothing breaks
[6:17:05] pumpkinking999: Anyone know if that frostdk has a stream?
[6:17:22] V0lt4GE1: then beta might be like mass-invite
[6:17:22] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[6:17:29] V0lt4GE1: so ppl can test their classes
[6:17:30] LoseAlotLuke: Is this the guy who sent garrosh to past draenor? @Towelliee
[6:17:34] V0lt4GE1: and make WAs
[6:17:46] Partizangaming: Mucho invites /pray
[6:17:52] im_mezzro: lol every alpha and beta is marketing. Give to streamers and thats it
[6:18:04] gold9871: a self selling product :)
[6:18:09] Voiddyn: Do you feel like the first way of Alpha is to instill confidence on how good their changes are?
[6:18:14] Voiddyn: wave*
[6:18:23] V0lt4GE1: I got 1st wave invite with streamers

[6:18:26] V0lt4GE1: back in SL
[6:18:33] mavericks312: probably the smartest thing they did too
[6:18:38] ZetYokai: very good approach
[6:18:42] LearnedSomething: well that's pretty above board of them
[6:18:49] smashwow: so much for it's ready when it's ready if they're saying their under the gun
[6:18:50] LearnedSomething: I appreciate the candor
[6:19:12] Stampsha: But i wouls say have a more focused alpha with less content a week and get it more tested so it will be better for launch
[6:19:22] mavericks312: @smashwow i mean they have been working on DF since mid SL apparently so we will see
[6:19:32] slothix_rs: focus testing is a very good point but to enroll only content creator is a bad idea..
[6:19:56] smashwow: @mavericks312 that's typical for all xpacs. they were working on SL during BFA.
[6:19:59] Daemoos6: Shaman new main? KappaHD
[6:20:01] mavericks312: @slothix_wr a normal 9-5 worker doesnt have much time to test
[6:20:09] ashwing_: enroll the LFR Andies KEKW
[6:20:19] ChromaticTank: cause we ain't getting in towCry towCry
[6:20:26] mavericks312: @smashwow see i think more like how they worked on legion mid way thru WoD
[6:20:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: The average gamer only has like an hour or two per day to play
[6:20:35] ElDrakenMan: id argue content creators dont give feedback that is best for the overall playerbase
[6:20:36] zgag: Seems like focus testing isn't fully working if the players are already getting bored.  Maybe Blizzard should double the amount that is released per build.  Or some super large build per release
[6:20:47] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:20:48] Deadelus0: i always pop at the wrong moment Kappa
[6:21:00] mavericks312: @drakenPWN but again they have more time to put into alpha's and beta's then a regular player does
[6:21:01] Stampsha: @slothix_wr I think it is good to start with them. Then Blizz get to show off what they have soo far and all the viewers can take part in seeing everything and come up with ideas on how to maybe fix things and find bugs along the way
[6:21:06] V0lt4GE1: btw @Towelliee a bug report u can do, why does ur boss frame show 5 flame shock debuffs
[6:21:19] Jaren475: @Towelliee apologies if you answered this when I asked earlier, I tend to lose focus quickly :( How we keep up to date on testing phases and their content and goals?
[6:21:21] kenmed_: Sometimes it just annoys people because they have alpha fomo and get upset seeing content creators only in alpha, and a large majority of them not even submitting feedback etc
[6:21:26] smashwow: @mavericks312 yea but that's a typical dev cycle for them. if you listen to any interview they say. we've been working on it since before the launch of the prior xpac etc.
[6:21:28] manmower: this fight needs AVR
[6:21:44] BoiAtomico: You said it yourself Towel, some of the content creators aren't giving a shit since it's "focus testing" without free access to a lot of shit. More people (alongside the content creators) equals better testing
[6:22:32] KizaruGR: Oh, interesting. So the infinite dragonflight is back
[6:22:33] mavericks312: @smashwow sure your not wrong with anything you said im just going off the assumption they moved most of the team to DF mid Sl to where usually its a small team
[6:22:39] manmower: tons of eyeballs also to back up what you're seeing a well
[6:22:39] Stampsha: Less content pr build will make it more focus testet and maybe everything that is not working will be found
[6:22:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: more like 7-5 for me LUL
[6:22:55] smashwow: @mavericks312 i'm cautious but i hope it's good. i really do. but when statements like we have to hit a deadline. the culture they keep saying is changing hasn't changed. that's the cause for caution on my part.
[6:23:01] Praetour: A strteamer can also hype 1 million of their ffollowers for the game as opposed to you and 5 friends
[6:23:02] sitmeee: Facts!
[6:23:05] admiralRipsnarl: Big true
[6:23:10] hasan666: unpaid alpha testers KEKW
[6:23:20] impaylor: Facts
[6:23:20] Deadelus0: Facts, + i can test the game while working :-p
[6:23:22] V0lt4GE1: plus when u try everything that is focus tested that week
[6:23:24] V0lt4GE1: u will prob leave
[6:23:26] Stampsha: 1 Towelliee playing and 3000 people wathing the game
[6:23:29] V0lt4GE1: and come back next week
[6:23:31] PigPenLen: makes total sense
[6:23:32] Shattermare: Why is who gets alpha such an obsession
[6:23:36] Nerendis: How is this even an argument? It should always be content creators first. What whinny idiot doesn’t agree?
[6:23:39] sitmeee: pretty smart move on Blizzards side tbh
[6:23:40] slothix_rs: but thats is the point we the 9-5 people see in the end what works for casual not a content creator , in the past there was always that the problem
[6:23:42] CajunCrusader: 100% Big True!
[6:23:45] mavericks312: @Shattermare fomo
[6:23:46] wesosdqueso: but i wanna play POOGERS
[6:23:49] V0lt4GE1: did Preach get his alpha yet?
[6:23:58] GiraffeHydra_: @Shattermare because people wanna play, and if they don't get invited they want to blame someone
[6:24:01] Praetour: @V0lt4GE1 After like 2 days or so
[6:24:02] KizaruGR: I would rather play the beta than the alpha xD
[6:24:06] belaham: @V0lt4GE1 Yes
[6:24:11] Shattermare: @mavericks312 It’s the opposite of fomo though, everyone will get to play at some point
[6:24:15] mavericks312: @slothix_wr but a casual player wont be plkaying long enough to see those things
[6:24:31] ShadowDMG6969: WOW
[6:24:34] sitmeee: LUL
[6:24:38] lurker198: i work 40 hours a week but have 4 days off a week as well - don't put me in a casual bubble, I can degen with a job XD - not arguing against your point just saying lol
[6:24:44] manmower: stats gonna break your char
[6:24:47] JellonaCub: LUL
[6:24:56] Shattermare: @baleroc1 No it’s not, it’s alpha, it literally doesn’t matter lol
[6:24:56] ShadowDMG6969: PICK AXE OF DESTRUCTION
[6:25:00] V0lt4GE1: can u highlight it again
[6:25:01] mavericks312: @Baleroc1 not really more eyes see the alpha and beta then bob who has been playing for 15 yrs with his 5 friends
[6:25:04] Cakeabsorber: monkaW
[6:25:05] manmower: bug report those pickaxe stats
[6:25:06] nvnto: bricking your character? KEKW
[6:25:10] Daarksyde: What people don’t understand is the need for feedback/reporting of bugs/testing in alpha. All these kids think they want just want early access to the game without actually “testing” it
[6:25:12] Praetour: I think that was Sargeras pickaxe
[6:25:17] maalow: pickaxe of oblivion KEKW
[6:25:21] GiraffeHydra_: Behold, the Worldbreaker, greatest tool of all time
[6:25:41] hasan666: @Baleroc1 Blizzard "alpha" is a promo program, not really for fixing bugs.
[6:25:41] mavericks312: ppl want alpha and beta just to say they have them
[6:25:44] smashwow: yes everyone feels entitled to get alpha. i just want alpha in the hands of people that will TEST the content. and will represent the population that plays the game. not just he 1%
[6:25:45] zgag: If that was live that weapon would go for lots of gold
[6:25:49] nvnto: @manmower 100% not a bug. they  dont want profession gear to be irrelevant.
[6:25:55] manmower: wine wives?
[6:25:56] Cakeabsorber: KKEKW
[6:25:58] Cakeabsorber: KEKW *
[6:26:02] WhiteKnight74648: Surveys. LUL
[6:26:04] fluh_: You can prolly break that rock in the dungeon in one swing with that KEKW
[6:26:05] sitmeee: LUL
[6:26:09] manmower: you'd get some crazy bug reports
[6:26:10] lurker198: avg hours played per day XD
[6:26:13] mavericks312: you cant test an alpha when little charlie is throwing rolls of toilet paper down the drain
[6:26:13] V0lt4GE1: tbh I rather get beta when all the classes are added and I can test them in dungeons
[6:26:16] OriCol: Can’t wait for my invite next time
[6:26:17] Aquadriel: lmao
[6:26:18] HoppsiDejsi: The 900days + players lol
[6:26:20] kashmara: the wine mommies
[6:26:27] smashwow: lol i'd go for a wine wife Kappa
[6:26:31] PigPenLen: Mines a vodka wife
[6:26:32] Shattermare: Getting alpha literally doesn’t matter it’s meant to stress test not to brag lol
[6:26:33] sitmeee: or do what they've been doing.
[6:26:40] InspirationStimulationYT: do u know when open alpha will be?
[6:26:42] caedx: what is the name of this song?
[6:26:45] maalow: you can break the silithus sword with that pickaxe
[6:26:46] Wheeellz: asmon logs on for 10 minutes and tries to go out of the map and never logs in again : )
[6:26:50] Th3_Sassquatch: It would be savage to play alpha and beta, but i dont have the time. i just hope the right people get it to know good from bad.
[6:27:01] Daarksyde: Who says someone that plays everyday will report bugs and test things tho?…
[6:27:03] Shattermare: @grizznif WOTLK Lich king soundtrack
[6:27:08] hasan666: moron?
[6:27:12] mavericks312: @Baleroc1 its not though, cause alpha and beta are for good feedback not just to be able to play the game early
[6:27:12] caedx: @Shattermare Thank you!
[6:27:14] snackpakahoy0: dang why is frost trike so high?
[6:27:17] snackpakahoy0: strike
[6:27:26] ashwing_: Climbing mountains NODDERS
[6:27:27] Derion91: hey do we know what is coming tomorrow ?
[6:27:28] lurker198: Who says they won't report bugs though?  Why play devils advocate in only a negative facet?
[6:27:28] Shattermare: @snackpakahoy0 Talents
[6:27:29] Shrapnel_Sponge: @snackpakahoy0 they buffed it
[6:27:30] snackpakahoy0: ohhhhh nvm
[6:27:34] soggyshoggoth: chain lighting isn't a big damage dealer on live either
[6:27:35] Naturalbeef: People come up with some crazy justifications for their jealousy of not having Alpha access
[6:28:02] Shrapnel_Sponge: Can't wait for Feral Sprits and Ascendance so you wreck house
[6:28:09] Hypertitan: i wanna see if a full windfury build will work
[6:28:11] snackpakahoy0: thtas sick
[6:28:20] mavericks312: i would love alpha but im not gonna get mad when a content creator gets it and i dont when 6k eyes see there gameplay

[6:28:23] brian_777777777: towellie what is replacing Anima in DF is it going to be renown
[6:28:23] Shattermare: Frost spells are the least synergistic/least relevant, I think they did a much better job with fire and lightning trees
[6:28:43] thelimitlesstv: thelimitlesstv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[6:28:52] Lulaboo: @Moobot BAHAHA I just saw this for the first time
[6:29:06] Shattermare: Time for Cata!
[6:29:15] lurker198: I mean - in real life, media gets access to things first in most everything, hype building is important.
[6:29:20] Cakeabsorber: KEKW
[6:29:24] ashwing_: KEKW
[6:29:27] Hypertitan: perfect
[6:29:30] JellonaCub: Professions truely matter now LUL
[6:29:30] Trekxx: bricked character KEKW
[6:29:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: 96% crit sounds a little high LUL
[6:29:32] mavericks312: after wrath they should call it cata remastered instead of cata classic
[6:29:33] Manabucho: LULW
[6:29:34] maalow: 96% crit KEKW
[6:29:37] zgag: Alpha actually does have more significance for this xpac.  With such a quick release date the way they invited in the past shouldn't really apply to the current testing.  Now, they have adapted some with the focusing testing, but if they don't change the way invites go out compared to the past it might fizzle out  (To the person who mentioned 'it's only Alpha)
[6:29:45] xluckydawgx: The new meta
[6:29:47] Cakeabsorber: WTF is those stats the minig picks have stats now?
[6:29:47] Hypertitan: it's fiiiine...working as intended
[6:29:49] xluckydawgx: mining picks
[6:29:50] Shamnator: you are superman now
[6:29:53] hasan666: @lurker198 it is called free advertisement
[6:29:56] Hypertitan: making professions great again :P
[6:30:06] lurker198: aye
[6:30:17] mavericks312: i think beta should have huge waves of invites if they plan on releasing this year
[6:30:21] Shrapnel_Sponge: the shaman trees are legit making me think going back to shaman after swapping main back in BFA. Though I'm still waiting for blizzard to release the paladin trees LUL
[6:30:21] lurker198: Sometimes less is more
[6:30:23] MOLAR305: @Towelliee you think they will ever open all profs on a single char like new world?
[6:30:31] smashwow: besides the hunter tree sucks
[6:30:34] smashwow: Kappa
[6:30:36] Cakeabsorber: Isn't 96% crit pretty extreme? KEKW
[6:30:36] Sollice: Maybe that new team that got folded in to Blizzard really pumped them full of staff who can clean up bugs and do more internal testing
[6:30:51] Praetour: Have you been clued in on how many zones you'll be able to test in alpha vs beta?
[6:31:01] Shattermare: Why do we care enough about alpha/beta to keep talking about it KEKW
[6:31:02] apb89: We were in shadowlands for 7 years
[6:31:04] mavericks312: @Sollice or they throw that team on retail to put more seasoned devs on DF
[6:31:06] Sollice: @Praetour All 4 zones will be cycled through in Alpha
[6:31:23] Stampsha: Having 10 testers who can test 1 hr a day is worse then having 2-3 content creators who can play 5-7 hr a day with 2k + people watching
[6:31:24] ijuki: @Shrapnel_Sponge Same, I am curious if the holy tree got changed ... which I clearly doubt since the mastery sucks balls
[6:31:32] Praetour: @Sollice nice! wont have to wait too long to see it all
[6:31:36] xluckydawgx: LMAOOOOO
[6:31:38] xluckydawgx: holy fuck
[6:31:39] smashwow: i mean to be fair they do have the hours that people play wow and time frames. that's how they caught a lot of the bots in WoD @Towelliee
[6:31:43] Hypertitan: that's all fine....lol
[6:31:46] Praetour: Imagine killing a training dummy KEKW
[6:31:51] Sollice: @mavericks312 Retail is kind of on maintenance mode until DF. I doubt they need that many staff to maintain it. Season 4 and that new system was probably setup a while back
[6:31:53] mavericks312: before S-lands i played maybe a total of 5 months from MoP to legion so i know im not getting alpha lol
[6:31:55] ShadowDMG6969: wHAT IS THAT dps OUTPUT
[6:31:58] manmower: you're pulling SL numbers now
[6:32:00] Elseworldz: Enhancement=Goated
[6:32:01] Zalarias: yoo towelliee you play lost ark at all still? just a general question no troll.
[6:32:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: they are all crits!
[6:32:01] GamingDad77: #woirkingasintended
[6:32:01] Ordicos: well thats broke
[6:32:02] maalow: 54k crits KEKW
[6:32:05] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee what do you hope next clas testing will be?
[6:32:09] Metrii: do
[6:32:09] Hypertitan: oh yeah....that's perfectly fine
[6:32:10] Metrii: dude
[6:32:12] manmower: go pvp people
[6:32:13] Praetour: Go duel asmon
[6:32:14] Metrii: I want to play that
[6:32:14] zgag: Do it
[6:32:15] mavericks312: @Sollice thats true your probably right
[6:32:18] Metrii: YES GO PVP
[6:32:22] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Shrapnel_Sponge yeah man, I'm on the fence between retri, enhancement or unholy dk. Unholy DK is getting a revamp, enh looks super strong and no paladin trees is making me impatient!
[6:32:24] Metrii: troll pvp
[6:32:25] smashwow: yup that's not going to need reported Kappa
[6:32:29] Sarocus: Rextroyilee
[6:32:32] ijuki: 83k crit monkaS
[6:32:34] Hypertitan: wtf those frostshock crits! haha
[6:32:34] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee I can see the blizz employee reading the logs doing a spit-take after this lol
[6:32:39] Metrii: agree
[6:32:39] ShadowDMG6969: WTAF THIS IS WHACK LOL THE DPS IS RIDICOLOUS
[6:32:40] manmower: report that Training Dummy for being too strong
[6:32:49] lurker198: i haven't played retail since shadowlands came out - reinstalling now about to come back and have fun til dragons xD
[6:32:49] Cakeabsorber: Hunter with leech buff = GG
[6:32:52] zgag: Rextro would have made an Alpha video with that weapon
[6:32:57] wazza76: do not hit the report bug button!! i repeat....
[6:33:06] ijuki: What weapon?
[6:33:09] Hypertitan: i would totally do a dungeon
[6:33:09] mavericks312: @lurker198 great time to come back especially if you wanna level alts
[6:33:14] ijuki: I do not have sound on
[6:33:19] Tikkser: Tombstone:No matter how hard he tried. He could never kill the training dummy.
[6:33:35] skrin001: What would happen if you put the hammer in the other had
[6:33:37] Nougat_V: so can you stack it with different tools ?xD
[6:33:40] xluckydawgx: https://clips.twitch.tv/SarcasticBoldKiwiOMGScoots-dq2MMV9LqgKy73oU
[6:33:41] Mecabeast: in some cases streamers don't even need to hit the report button because devs are usually watching the stream
[6:33:46] manmower: they gotta add voice lines to the training dummies while you fight em "Who'
[6:33:49] smashwow: you'd hope
[6:34:03] lurker198: @mavericks312 I'm actually not huge on alts, but may try a new character in shadowlands for once.  Planning on re-maining to evoker anyways
[6:34:06] slothix_rs: @Mecabeast for sure xD
[6:34:06] andrejhmm: @Towelliee Asmongold does the Alpha every time. He just doesn't like spoilers and wants to keep all the info to himself or at least so he says. + People are crazy stalkers asking about him all the time because he is taking Vacation from streaming. People need to go touch grass. It's a game and a gamer - chill.
[6:34:14] zgag: The wand from MOP was fun
[6:34:22] zgag: During testing
[6:34:48] DecayedmiNt: The secret channel Kappa
[6:35:01] manmower: did the testing roadmap mention anything about pvp?
[6:35:19] Metrii: I would message them and ask why I didn't have rum and coffee brought to me yet
[6:35:20] Sollice: Secrets Secrets are no fun. Secrets Secrets can hurt someone!
[6:35:52] Hartel: can u show again?
[6:35:59] Youredoneson666: that also gave you 180kish health
[6:36:02] abracka_: pvwho?
[6:36:07] zgag: Should have dueled someone first
[6:36:12] DecayedmiNt: PvP OMEGALUL
[6:36:13] Sollice: PVWhat?
[6:36:14] ElDrakenMan: whats PVP Kappa
[6:36:16] geokouts: 96% hit? Total Normal phenomenon
[6:36:18] dranet11: pvp and raid testing will be beta
[6:36:21] Mitune: Pvp does need a ton of people
[6:36:24] ShadowDMG6969: Test the pick out in a Dungeon
[6:36:31] Jomuse92: who the hell is pvp?
[6:36:33] buckshot9000: rated solo queue will be very nice
[6:36:34] thenormalbeast: It seems it is going to be broken, all over the place
[6:36:34] mavericks312: would it be crazy to think were getting BFA legacy dmg with DF lol
[6:36:41] NBK_Sethus: really hoping for some open world pvp events like in BFA
[6:36:42] buckshot9000: duel me with that pick
[6:36:52] MOLAR305: @Towelliee do you think they will ever open all professions to a single char?
[6:36:56] PvtHudson093: look at the top gladiator players
[6:37:08] Nerendis: Just invite people at 2.4k and higher.
[6:37:10] Praetour: Glads and RBG
[6:37:11] Sollice: @MOLAR305 No. Would ruin economy and social part of the game
[6:37:18] Trekxx: honor level
[6:37:20] notColt45: Top 1000 leaderboard?
[6:37:21] Trekxx: ez
[6:37:22] Mitune: rank and games played

[6:37:22] andrejhmm: Warrior and Beast Mastery Hunter + Restoration Eveoker are going to be broken.
[6:37:28] manmower: gonna have to get anyone with any pvp during SL
[6:37:28] abracka_: honestly the main talents we're playing with now should be disabled in instanced pvp content (enabled open world). there should be a secondary smaller tree for instanced pvp imo
[6:37:39] Mecabeast: highwarlords kekw
[6:37:39] NexGenHyper: i have over 4k 3v3 games in this season at 2.7CR :P
[6:37:50] pumpkinking999: Lord mes got alpha
[6:37:58] geokouts: Have a great day Towelliee and chat :)
[6:38:00] hasan666: @MOLAR305 People can create alts anyway. what is the difference?
[6:38:05] manmower: they should invite anyone that pvps and isn't a rogue or mage
[6:38:14] Aidler: blizz probably thinks PVP is another thing that distracts people from M+ and raiding. Leveling > M+ and raiding only is the blizz plan for Dragonflight
[6:38:32] ijuki: PvP DansGame
[6:38:34] SensationalBanana: B-b-but, I love watching you murder Nalak! :g
[6:38:38] Deadelus0: Cya T!
