[3:45:00] Stonefather: Name one thing Tyrande has done impressive in the last 10k years.
[3:45:07] Molvonos: Because that's so obviously not him.
[3:45:11] NormalNomad: making him a fuckin bird thing was so stupid, honestly
[3:45:35] tlsmith3638: Malfurion made a good pawn loan for a green dragon this xpac

[3:47:45] tlsmith3638: oh i got it tyrande point in the story  was to get illidan to be a badass to "earn her love"
[3:48:23] OviTheGray: Metzen said his favourite characters are Thrall and Malfurion.. one became green Jessus.. one became sleeping beauty HypeLUL
[3:48:37] Stonefather: Illidan busts out of prison when Tyrande dies and one taps Malfurion.
[3:48:53] lastdeviljoker666: lol

[3:49:31] Electafuzz: I'm ready to be drowning in dwarves
[3:49:44] tlsmith3638: the reason the titans come back is because illidan comes back becasue tyrande dies

[4:07:18] tlsmith3638: khadgar neem held of kara for a while who knows what spells he learned up there

[4:07:34] PleaseeStop: true i heard guldan peed a little when he heard someone say gamon
[4:07:51] Stonefather: I'd even say Velen is probably more powerful than Azshara
[4:08:12] Chelidda: All these superpowerful beings around, and they still employ my derp ass characters... what is wrong with them!
[4:08:25] OviTheGray: azshara is 10 levels over Velen
[4:08:32] gelimarr: We are tiny gods with infinite respawn
[4:08:47] Electafuzz: some might say you get to borrow it
[4:09:13] OviTheGray: lorewise maybe Azshara, Kadghar and Malfurion.. aspects aside
[4:09:38] Gemini_Tank: I dont actually think that aspects are that powerful though
[4:09:50] Epiclurker27893: we don't know what powers Magni has so he could be a wildcard
[4:10:02] gelimarr: Magniiii

[4:10:21] PleaseeStop: AZEROTHS WOOOOOOOOOOUNDS
[4:10:42] Electafuzz: unless azeroth is a titan
[4:10:43] Stonefather: I thought Azeroth empowered them
[4:10:55] gelimarr: Magni is overpowered
[4:10:57] tlsmith3638: so he playing 4d chess?
[4:11:02] karaste: Maybe the original titan endowed powers were ones they stole from Azeroth
[4:11:04] king_julian_96: we will probably kill iridikron in the war within if iam being honest
[4:11:17] Gemini_Tank: Malfurion is uber broken though

[4:11:27] Stonefather: I was like 92% positive they were blessed by Azeroth so they were still Titan empowered.
[4:11:30] Electafuzz: lol, why are the aspects from jersey
[4:11:47] Electafuzz: LUL

[4:11:49] Molvonos: @Stonefather Assuming Azeroth is a 'titan' in that sense.
[4:11:57] gelimarr: New Jersey
[4:12:16] OviTheGray: @Stonefather empowered by the spirits of the dead night elves in the tear of elune
[4:12:19] Molvonos: Life/Death empowered.
[4:12:31] epaladin1235: I wonder where Slyvannas falls into the new expansion
[4:12:37] tlsmith3638: yep
[4:12:37] ChiefLongsword: YES
[4:12:38] ZomBiE519: yes
[4:12:40] Molvonos: But yea, prolly linked to Azeroth.  The first world tree was connected to Azeroth  too
[4:12:40] abidetx: EZ $
[4:12:43] ChiefLongsword: Morning
[4:12:44] abidetx: printing crazy rn
[4:12:44] karaste: YES!
[4:12:47] tlsmith3638: skinning is free money
[4:12:53] Stonefather: I mean I just assumed since it was growing on Azeroth it was more like a chain reaction
[4:12:56] OviTheGray: @epaladin1235 she needs to stay away for a few expansions
[4:12:58] karaste: Stranglethorn Vale is a nirvana for skinners
[4:13:06] Epiclurker27893: Where would the tree get it's power, it would have to be azeroth or the winter queen
[4:13:44] Molvonos: Life and Death, since it was created using Elune's Tear
[4:13:54] OviTheGray: if they are empowered by azeroth.. Azeroth is not a titan.. aspects said is not titan magic
[4:13:57] Molvonos: Which we got during Legion, as a Titan artifact
[4:14:03] Electafuzz: I thought they said the power came from azeroth in the cinematic.. I could be misremembering tho
[4:14:10] alienistslol: Why do night elves need a tree? Why can't they just live in a regular city
[4:14:11] Stonefather: I was hoping Elune was something outside the normal universe.
[4:14:12] Sadisticmedic: Just like Loki season 2
[4:14:20] gelimarr: Cosmic entitiy
[4:14:24] epaladin1235: yes but how much time has passed from the new expansion
[4:14:42] karaste: Or she’s a first one
[4:14:42] vimie: Firstest ones

[4:16:32] Epiclurker27893: First one elune, creator of the light and the shadow
[4:16:47] Molvonos: Elune with that cosmic bussy
[4:16:52] OviTheGray: so many questions.. we need Nobble HypeLUL
[4:16:55] geokouts: maybe a Hermaphrodite?
[4:16:56] Sadisticmedic: towShy
[4:17:01] tlsmith3638: yea
[4:17:14] TheUnknowing: basically, so much skinning
[4:17:24] Stonefather: The Winter Queen calling Elune her sister sorta killed the hope that Elune is an all powerful deity.
[4:17:38] Molvonos: The anduin trailer
[4:18:03] tlsmith3638: metzen can recon it it was shadowlands lore
[4:18:07] Stonefather: I mean typically if you create something they call you mother or father.
[4:18:12] TheUnknowing: we wont know til we know
[4:18:16] king_julian_96: she spoke through tyrande
[4:18:19] Stonefather: I hope Metzen retcons all of SL
[4:18:30] Stonefather: Like 98% sure it's Azeroth
[4:18:51] tlsmith3638: that will be fine
[4:18:58] YzieGG: just forget him LUL
[4:19:03] OviTheGray: that is the world soul .. idk why i thought we heard Elune in one old cinematic.. i think im wrong

[4:19:07] tlsmith3638: just make it seem better than it was lol
[4:19:16] geokouts: Elfs seems to be a more Matriarhical than Patriarch so better chance Elune is Female
[4:19:21] Appollion: SL was great in theory but was just badly written
[4:19:24] Stonefather: He was talking about the return of Metzen
[4:19:29] Stonefather: We weren't prepared.
[4:19:41] sillen142: He's talking about whatever Danuser was about to pull out of his ass
[4:19:42] king_julian_96: mayeb the titans
[4:19:43] Stonefather: No it would be something universally or outside
[4:19:48] king_julian_96: he is refferencing
[4:19:51] Epiclurker27893: we heard Elune talking through Tyrande in Shadowlands

[4:20:38] Molvonos: Considering the Shadowlands, the Void Gods, and the Fel wanted Azeroth, what if 'what's coming' is a full scale cosmic war?
[4:20:39] cipusanx: legion was so cool man
[4:20:45] TheUnknowing: I mean lets be honest, we dealt with the primalist fairly easily, with iridikron doing who the fuck really knows. but the point still stands, it definitely wasnt the primalist he was worried about.
[4:21:10] Stonefather: I mean I assume Light vs Void will happen in the trilogy
[4:21:27] karaste: Azerothians are filthy corpse litterers, as a skinner it is your solemn duty to clean up their shit and laugh all the way to the bank
[4:21:29] OviTheGray: oh.. the one time Elune spoke... was through Tyrande's voice.. in Ardenweald with the Winter Queen
[4:21:31] Appollion: @Stonefather i hope so, we need to see aurelion snap
[4:22:01] OviTheGray: illidan is a demon.. can a demon turn into a titan?
[4:22:03] geokouts: maybe the Cat Lady in Elwynn IS a Titan? :P
[4:22:09] Stonefather: Illdian fulfills his prophecy but instead of light it's Order.
[4:22:11] Molvonos: I don't t hink Illidan would allow himself to be infused with Order.
[4:22:20] tlsmith3638: well illidan did have the golden eyes of great destiny
[4:22:23] Jaqhuir: Illigeras

[6:08:19] abracka_: can't meld in combat
[6:08:20] polaropposite76: @OviTheGray no not in classic
[6:08:29] mysterymagexd: i find it interesting seeing how long ppl still complain about gold sell of the sort, for someone playing game for over 23 years (and other old heads that played for longer), csgo, tf2, eso, eve online, every game has a market/exchange, I find it fascinating and insane really but its true and its their as long that exchange is in demand.
[6:09:10] OviTheGray: @polaropposite76 oh.. tnx
[6:09:14] geokouts: as long there are buyers there will be sellers
[6:09:26] radiorahem: ^
[6:09:42] radiorahem: players are just as guilty as the sellers
[6:09:45] TheUnknowing: I honestly dont care about gold selling or bots, if i see a bot i report and move on. Not something i participate in so it doesnt matter much to me, unless they are stealing my quest mobs :P
[6:09:47] gsting: as long as gold selling is profitable it wont go away
[6:10:04] abracka_: shit look at what happened to sodapoppin lol
[6:10:07] abracka_: mf just got gold removed
