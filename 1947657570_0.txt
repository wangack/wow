[4:04:00] Cowardpatty: I left my wife for ICC
[4:06:20] Cowardpatty: LOL plans ruined
[4:06:21] HEIZALL: :D
[4:06:34] Emmanuelxt12: 4Head
[4:07:25] Galdrena: Ashes of Creation is going to come out in 2030 at this rate lol
[4:07:30] DeeZeeGames: maybe metzen can give us classic+ or wow 2
[4:07:32] Cowardpatty: LOL
[4:07:42] DeeZeeGames: ashes is too far away
[4:07:44] Pallyofhell: they're not doing classic+ LUL
[4:07:59] Dirtnap1114: there will never be a classic plus because it would take resources and they cant monetize it further than classic
[4:08:03] DeeZeeGames: id love a 3rd person single player warcraft rpg
[4:08:10] BigZevs: im 55 and still going stronk in WoW <3
[4:08:15] Pallyofhell: no they're doing another season of mastery
[4:08:16] kingofalldeimos: ^
[4:08:42] kingofalldeimos: I havent played in a long time, but still love watching the old legends
[4:08:45] Pallyofhell: classic+ is just copium
[4:09:23] DeeZeeGames: i really don't want to see cata or panadria classic but i might be the minority
[4:09:32] Dirtnap1114: cata > wrath
[4:09:54] LitheHS: mankirk's wife hardest quest in game :p

[4:09:58] cakebattertv: you sound excited about cata
[4:10:01] adarius11: @kingofalldeimos same
[4:10:09] Eloc_Evil: Mists of Pandaria will definitely happen.
[4:10:14] Dirtnap1114: cata was my fav pvp xpac
[4:10:14] Pawdeloup: VoHiYo
[4:10:51] HeIlraiser_: mist of panda was the worst of all time its the one that killed the game LUL
[4:10:51] Pallyofhell: cata was good. its just the last patch that left a bad taste in everyones mouth
[4:11:08] Cowardpatty: If they make a MoP classic, I will 100% make a human WW monk
[4:11:14] Galdrena: i liked mop
[4:11:22] lajadoulerie_official: Kreygasm
[4:11:30] limit77: OBSIDIAN SWIFTY
[4:11:34] Eloc_Evil: Classic plus would be a rare thing. It would be easier for them to release a expac with Vanilla qualities rather than expand on Classic.
[4:11:39] HeIlraiser_: mist of pandaria was when blizzard sold out for a movie lol
[4:11:49] Khonz92: !Points
[4:11:49] StreamElements: @Khonz92 Khonz92 has 36955 points and is rank 1505/147395 on the leaderboard.
[4:12:07] Pallyofhell: they already said they wouldnt expand on classic.
[4:12:30] chha1989: have you died since your lvl 17 ?
[4:12:35] Pallyofhell: they said this back when they were doing vanilla classic
[4:12:40] Dirtnap1114: they also said theyd never re release classic
[4:12:48] HeIlraiser_: they wont expand they will recycle retail into classic+ brains people
[4:12:54] PaEu: They did not say that, they already did SoM and announce SoM 2
[4:13:14] Pallyofhell: SoM isnt an expanison of classic
[4:13:25] Dirtnap1114: som 2 is confirmed, it just isnt called that
[4:13:37] PaEu: My guess for classic+/SoM2 is vanilla with arenas and RBG's, and maybe slight class balances. something like that
[4:13:52] chha1989: someone boost this guy, need a awsome warr geard for this turny
[4:14:03] Pallyofhell: its probably just SoM 2 and cata classic being announced at blizzcon
[4:14:46] nyykez: not playing icc release today?

[6:22:45] Whitehamma: have you thought about slot car track?
[6:22:50] romanChaoui: wouldnt advise against a wall
[6:22:53] BoricuaSJ: Shuffleboard powder is sometimes called wax, salt, sand or sawdust. It is a mixture of dried silicone beads and ground corn (corn meal) that lets the puck slide smoothly and quickly across the board.
[6:23:05] belberten: Looked a little small tho didnt it?

[6:26:32] Brimlly: I’m license to operate a forklift scissor lift boom lift
[6:26:52] OGSceneBoy: Yeah forklifts are easy to operate, save lots of money just renting one and putting it in place yourself
[6:26:52] BoricuaSJ: should be one of the corners... as it will be a gathering spot
[6:27:05] Swiftymcvay8: im certified tro run cranes
[6:27:19] BoricuaSJ: how wide/
[6:27:22] lenestusss: Are you going to make it to 60 in 20days? @swifty
[6:27:56] SwitchCore: I think a couple of those neon shuffleboards would be better bang for your buck.
[6:28:05] BoricuaSJ: how wide?
[6:28:19] PoppaShot: no he gets distracted to much @lenestusss LUL
[6:28:37] ZeBenny: So I'm confused, are you going to open your own arcade or setting up something like the gaming house you used to have?
[6:28:37] Swiftymcvay8: how will it be free play? customers would just pay by the hour and have full run of arcade?
[6:28:47] do_the_drew: sensor those jpegs
[6:29:03] BoricuaSJ: do you need the 31  wall up?
[6:29:16] Axesmittayyy: Can you take out the two walls on the right side

[6:32:26] B_Rize: Not worth it
[6:32:34] PoppaShot: thats so much i wouldnt get the lanes
[6:32:56] B_Rize: You could fit a lot of machines in the space that would take up
[6:33:02] snorsen: so much space you could use for other stuff tho, doesn't fit the room layout imo
[6:33:30] viirracocha: nah dont do it
[6:34:09] Aggro_Life: Is this for the new arcade place you trying to plan 😆
[6:34:34] snorsen: future expansion
[6:34:35] HasbullasBro: Bowling alley in ur house is wild lol
[6:34:52] HasbullasBro: Ohhh
[6:34:54] HasbullasBro: Very cool
[6:34:57] Whitehamma: I dont think bowling fits your theme of free play
[6:35:01] Aggro_Life: Nice think you would need a little bigger place to get away with it and it not be cramped dude
[6:36:16] snorsen: will you have streamers over for collabs in there?
[6:36:20] Cowardpatty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3gSsISSYV0

[6:46:26] elsiefleur: no its your space you can use it for whatever really so you should be fine
[6:46:27] viirracocha: why not?
[6:46:32] Extreme_EG: im waiting to see these prot war duels in action
[6:46:37] frosty78: wouldnt you just need an occupency permit
[6:46:51] viirracocha: like family comes and help, why should the city say anyhting about it
[6:47:52] OGSceneBoy: Is the arcade going to be carpet?
[6:47:57] elsiefleur: if you signed the lease you can have ppl in there closed or not
[6:48:31] OGSceneBoy: I like that floor, carpet is so hard to keep clean
[6:48:32] lubus84: Looks amazing tho
[6:48:48] viirracocha: epoix floor?
[6:48:48] OGSceneBoy: I like the floor you got now yeah
[6:48:49] monkeyacc_: do you plan on having a bar or food?
[6:48:54] Blaster: hey swifty can u play the in game music please, it would be amazing
[6:49:02] frosty78: A certificate of occupancy is a document issued by a local government agency or building department certifying a building's compliance with applicable building codes and other laws, and indicating it to be in a condition suitable for occupancy, so you should be good so long as you aint open to the public requiring insurance
[6:49:46] OGSceneBoy: Too hard to clean carpet, rather be able to just sweep
[6:49:46] shytegamer420: carpet is rough to maintain if you dont put rules in place for clean footwear
[6:49:54] Lotsovkhaos: carpet is also an added cleaning expense. Tile is so much easier to clean
[6:50:16] lil_AmishOG: yeah floorcare on carpet in a space like that is an expense in itsetl
[6:50:18] lil_AmishOG: itself*
[6:50:51] Axesmittayyy: For the volunteers, have them sign a waiver that you’re free of liability
[6:51:02] OGSceneBoy: My old business carpet was ruined within a year
[6:51:07] frosty78: epoxy the floor, high traffic resistant, the stuff you put in a fancy garage
[6:51:08] Lotsovkhaos: It's also much easier to move machines around for deep cleaning or reorganizing the floorspace
[6:51:09] lil_AmishOG: if they can coat it with something uniform and leave it as is
[6:51:11] Whitehamma: what about noise?
[6:51:14] OGSceneBoy: Epoxy problem solved
[6:51:31] shytegamer420: Yeah epoxy is the way to go
[6:51:42] shytegamer420: carpet is never the move
[6:51:44] viirracocha: ye epoxy and u can add for sure floerecent paint in  it
[6:51:56] OGSceneBoy: You can dop epoxy yourself too, its easy
[6:51:57] viirracocha: ye
[6:52:00] viirracocha: like that
[6:52:08] lil_AmishOG: i manage 5 office building floorcare and carpets are time consuming and in a high traffic area a lot of upkeep to have them nice..
[6:52:10] partyfavrs: yeah but old school arcade carpet is sick though.
[6:52:13] Axesmittayyy: You can even do the,”If he dies, he dies” lol jk
[6:52:19] ValidusWOW: Hey Swifty
[6:52:24] viirracocha: ye its self lvling and just trow in buckets of the mix
[6:52:33] OGSceneBoy: Yeah
[6:52:41] SwitchCore: some of those decisions must be impacted by whether you own or lease the building eh?
[6:52:46] lil_AmishOG: a design would be nice with epoxy
[6:52:51] OGSceneBoy: You can hire a epoxy artist if you want and do like retro colors
[6:52:54] Metalcalfe: Swifty's gonna need someone to help power level him for the tourney, I'd help but I don't have any chars atm. :(
[6:53:03] lil_AmishOG: no mobs attacking you right LOL
[6:53:12] Blaster: LMAO
[6:53:14] Vahri: vahriWave vahriWave vahriWave
[6:53:19] Blaster: yes those are the exact lyrics lmao
[6:53:28] Vahri: Did you get the broom mount!?
[6:53:31] OGSceneBoy: ITS super easy to do epoxy, I did it with no experience
[6:53:35] Metalcalfe: That much epoxy would cost a fortune
[6:53:47] burnzy85: if you replace the "shorts" with a "v" in the youtube url you can have full control of scrolling through the video
[6:54:03] Vahri: Epoxy is not super cheap vahriXD vahriXD
[6:54:18] OGSceneBoy: Plus epoxy is so durable
[6:54:19] Metalcalfe: I saw someone using it to make a table and it cost like 5 grand just in epoxy
[6:54:44] lil_AmishOG: its more than carpet per square ft lol
[6:54:46] Reedy177: Someone spills a drink on that and down they go
[6:54:49] Lotsovkhaos: yeah this stuff is expensive
[6:55:11] OGSceneBoy: You can get cheap epoxy
[6:55:14] lil_AmishOG: but maintenance savings... you could do the math
[6:55:16] frosty78: do it yourself, it isnt
[6:55:22] OGSceneBoy: But they do have expensive options as well
[6:55:28] ValidusWOW: 208 isn't bad
[6:55:30] Lotsovkhaos: If you go cheap, you'll get cheap quality
[6:55:33] OGSceneBoy: Just do it yourself, epoxy is very easy
[6:55:36] Vahri: vahriFp vahriFp
[6:55:53] lil_AmishOG: google says 3$-12$ square ft
[6:56:00] lil_AmishOG: big range.. LOL
[6:56:20] Vahri: lmao
[6:56:31] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Think about it @swifty it's going to cost more per bucket and you have a lot of area to cover
[6:56:41] OGSceneBoy: There is a place near me that is around $1 per sq ft
[6:56:42] lil_AmishOG: get it rhino shield LOL
[6:56:43] viirracocha: how much for spray cans? u just go ham with different florecent cans?
[6:56:44] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: CVS epoxy would probably cost alot
[6:56:51] Vahri: Did you get the broom mount?
[6:57:07] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Depending on the amount that you have to buy for the whole place, epoxy would probably be a little expensive
[6:57:11] viirracocha: ye
[6:57:13] ValidusWOW: ever get bored of warrior?
[6:57:14] Vahri: Retail, its for getting 1000 travelers points
