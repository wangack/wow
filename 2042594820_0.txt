[1:01:11] fragileplasma: @luxumbra69 it was slightly below average now its well above average
[1:01:14] Reluctors: nerf ret, theyve been strong for too long
[1:01:24] luxumbra69: @fadingsurrealist you have no idea what you're talking about LOL
[1:01:28] kondelol: xdd
[1:01:28] Heavuh: ret finally playable feels good
[1:01:34] kondelol: COPIUM
[1:01:35] Heavuh: been dogshit for 10 years
[1:01:40] fragileplasma: It was only bad in key build
[1:01:51] adleydarling: o/ good evening dorki
[1:01:54] Xyronic: wait hes legendary blasting
[1:01:55] fragileplasma: @luxumbra69 you've typed 0 valid arguments lmao
[1:01:56] oneshotelitee: @nightbreeze93  sir yes sir , have a good one brother bear
[1:01:57] Xyronic: fake damage smh
[1:02:09] nightbreeze93: @oneshotelitee o7 brother
[1:02:15] Smeeshed: nobody has mentioned the stealth buff to unholy that the legendary mark applies from outbreak now
[1:02:26] luxumbra69: @fadingsurrealist ret ST in dungeons is AWFUL. literally lower than any other class. dont need to argue statistics. go check WCL.
[1:02:27] KaladinHS: what classes do the most ST damage to bosses in m+?
[1:02:40] Xyronic: push THIS
[1:02:52] whoknowsdude_: sub rog would be up there
[1:03:04] Reluctors: @luxumbra69 WutFace
[1:03:09] eitreen: rogue > pala
[1:03:11] oneshotelitee: I'm sure ret aswel with the new buffs
[1:03:11] fragileplasma: You seem to be completely ignoring the buff buddy thats the reason theyre being played now lmao
[1:03:26] nightbreeze93: juno keep your head down what are you doing ReallyMad
[1:03:29] Xyronic: CHILLY
[1:03:30] nightbreeze93: too late
[1:03:34] K4lsdern: wasn't the ret buff like 5% overall xdd
[1:03:35] jenkinsdonuttv: @luxumbra69 WAS* awful Big buffs.
[1:03:36] fragileplasma: Their AoE was alrdy good, their utility is great, theyre super tanky and now they do reasonable ST as well
[1:03:39] luxumbra69: @fadingsurrealist brother, it is the 2nd day of the buffs. people are "trying" them, not legitimately playing them in push keys.

[1:04:18] MostWantedN7: jonu
[1:04:22] nightbreeze93: jonu
[1:04:27] adleydarling: jonu
[1:04:30] oneshotelitee: @k4lsdern  na it was like. A 20-30 % overall increase a really good buff for them
[1:04:39] fragileplasma: Im not sure what your argument even is at this point. No one is saying ret is 100% required but definitely solid now
[1:04:47] Urebaldd: I just got here, I'm guessing juno got deleted already
[1:04:50] nightbreeze93: shouldn't you rename to juno_dk now
[1:04:52] K4lsdern: @oneshotelitee that is most definitely not what it was
[1:04:58] MostWantedN7: o7 Juno
[1:05:03] adleydarling: o7 Juno
[1:05:26] Schnuwuuu: anyone played blooddk already? i just finished a dungeon and it still feels like the moment you fail a button you are dead YEP
[1:05:27] jenkinsdonuttv: jonu
[1:06:14] oneshotelitee: @k4lsdern pretty sure it's close to that that's wat my best m8 told me he mains ret it was really big
[1:06:23] Albaaaz: @Schnuwuuu i have the same feeling, but im bad
[1:06:35] Schnuwuuu: yeah iam not saying iam good either LUL just wondering
[1:06:40] Xyronic: @juno_sha
[1:06:41] Xyronic: u ok?
[1:06:46] juno_sha: For now
[1:06:47] otigrudo: I'm the god compi, the real god compi. All you other god compis are just imitating so can the real god compi pls stand up?
[1:06:49] jenkinsdonuttv: @Schnuwuuu Did a couple weeklies, did feel a better defensively but still gotta do rotation kinda tightly. The buff amounts to maybe 4-5% less physical damage taken with boneshield, it's pretty good!
[1:06:50] Xyronic: wrong
[1:06:52] Urebaldd: LUL
[1:07:09] Xyronic: CHILLY
[1:07:12] Xyronic: GRRR
[1:07:22] oneshotelitee: Blood dk is so fun tho , I don't know why they are bad at high keys with all the hps they do , at wat key level do they start to flop?

[1:08:12] Tsarro1: Can you ask Yipz if he will stream? I love tank POV
[1:08:13] 프래그먼츠: ayayaxdd  󠀀
[1:08:15] Schnuwuuu: yeah the buff was pretty good i guess but it still feels...dunno. the moment i fail with my runepower iam just dead :D
[1:08:19] jenkinsdonuttv: BDK's health moves more, so when dmg gets too big, you can die before you heal up. Defensive rotation is extremely important but yeah it gets worse in high keys
[1:08:54] Urebaldd: This my favorite boss btw
[1:08:58] Urebaldd: xdd
[1:09:06] jenkinsdonuttv: You still can't fail with runepower. Something that helped me initially was not spending my runepower as soon as I have some. You gotta have some left for an emergency death strike
[1:09:12] oneshotelitee: @jenkinsdonuttv nat wat key level do you start to flop? If had a couple of bdks at 24 keys they where fine. I have only done 20s with mine lol
[1:09:17] oneshotelitee: At
[1:09:23] Celestial990: BDK is pure despair when you have to sit there and watch a bunch of mobs spam casts and you cant do anything
[1:09:25] jenkinsdonuttv: By can't fail, I mean if you fail it punishes you. Not that you literally can't fail xdd
[1:09:39] Celestial990: thats not the mention that you need way more effort and better play to live as easily as some other specs
[1:09:50] Ruinx81: What’s this boomy stuff, when you playing the true meta spec, BDK?
[1:10:20] jenkinsdonuttv: @oneshotelitee Highest I've done is 21 tho. What I say is to be taken with a grain of salt. But at that point my defensiveness was never an issue. Maybe 27-28 is where it becomes more obvi
[1:10:56] Schnuwuuu: dunno i just did my 20+, but my ilvl is only 460. so this hurts too xdd
[1:10:58] ncg20: Its noticeable on 26+ where you just die in a global doing normal pulls
[1:11:10] oneshotelitee: Hmm makes sense people say they flop hard at high keys
[1:11:15] dknamey: just talent rune tap OK
[1:11:19] Cruzerthebruzer: buff mage
[1:11:30] oneshotelitee: So 26 ish is a handicap for them unless your skilled
[1:11:32] zeph_6: fire so weak
[1:11:36] ncg20: Blood dk just sheer numbers through packs where a paladin might get like a constant 50% dr
[1:11:40] jenkinsdonuttv: @Schnuwuuu higher ilvl makes a big difference, esp. in BDK. HP, strenght, and more armor on boneshield
[1:11:41] Celestial990: @dknamey bdk could have a passive rune tap thats up 100% of the time it would still be bad
[1:11:48] jenkinsdonuttv: strength*
[1:12:23] jenkinsdonuttv: I just decided to talent umbilicus eternus and have an ''immunity'' every 45s, feels good xdd
[1:12:24] oneshotelitee: It sucks I really enjoy blood dk but then I get on my veng dh and I can pull the world lol
[1:12:28] nightbreeze93: Despairge
[1:12:36] spanish_late: is mage streaming ?
[1:12:47] oneshotelitee: It is time to level a new prot Pala tho , making my wife do that for me 😂

[1:13:36] oneshotelitee: @ruinx81  lucky you 😂
[1:13:59] Schnuwuuu: i did a 20+ where no incorp was cced xdd and the dps thought they had to pull more just to die for not kicking the bolts
[1:14:19] 프래그먼츠: buff fire mages Sadgi
[1:14:22] jenkinsdonuttv: Now if you get incorp'd as a bdk you're toast xdd
[1:14:31] weezie_61: Why is Boomie ST so high? they need some nerfs or somthing
[1:14:39] oneshotelitee: Lol that sounds more like the pug experience right there @schnuwuuu

[2:22:06] nightbreeze93: for test

[2:22:54] juno_sha: Opera or Brave
[2:22:56] juno_sha: too
[2:23:07] kaysiix: brave is really nice
[2:23:29] nightbreeze93: brave is nice but it's also chromium
[2:23:37] Vods: So is opera
[2:23:43] Standy94: Just got 4 butterfinger ads in a row. wtf is this stream audience?
[2:23:47] Vods: Firefox is the only non chromium left

[2:23:54] doogaar: @dorki  do you know what that health one is called off the top of your head
[2:23:59] nightbreeze93: opera made the swap?
[2:23:59] oakeri: just use firefox 4Head

[2:24:20] oakeri: firstGarf
[2:24:20] x_Scy: Nightbot wdym made the swap? there literally exists only chromium and firefox
[2:24:21] juno_sha: Firefox is sick, always used it
[2:24:36] nightbreeze93: opera used to be its own platform
[2:24:45] juno_sha: Just wait until i make my own jonu
[2:24:46] oakeri: yeah they nuked that a few years ago
[2:24:48] Vods: Yeah they changed a few years ago

[2:25:01] Muddymonk: Can you Z axis sanguine? Like take me in water and kill them in the same spot?
[2:25:04] oakeri: not sure what you did but, try firefox.

[2:29:01] Razzeu: @zachl_ in the task manager, is it chrome that takes that space? probably ig cause it happens when u open it, but check cause u never know

[2:33:22] zachl_: this wat it says for me
[2:33:55] nightbreeze93: well it's good news for chrome but now smells like drivers
[2:34:01] Canwestop: MONKA
[2:34:10] juno_sha: monkaSTEER
[2:34:12] Canwestop: !civcheck MONKA
[2:34:13] Nightbot: MONKA is 86% civilian.
[2:34:22] Canwestop: lmao no
[2:34:25] oakeri: @zachl_ try restarting the graphics driver win+ctrl+shift+b
[2:34:26] Canwestop: delete aug
[2:34:38] tettles: wtf they lobbed dorki moonkin
[2:34:38] zachl_: i mean idk its weird now i have everything up and running like normal and now its like 40%
[2:34:43] kkleenex: !civcheck
[2:34:43] Nightbot: kkleenex is 5% civilian.
[2:34:46] zachl_: like wtf is causing it to cap at 100%
[2:34:54] x_Scy: either update graphics drivers or downgrade to 537.58
[2:35:00] kittkattklunk: !civcheck
[2:35:03] juno_sha: Oh drivers, that's good
[2:35:04] Nightbot: gaakh is 92% civilian.
[2:35:08] Razzeu: @zachl_ try to recreate the 100% issue and check there
[2:35:14] juno_sha: That can mess things up
[2:35:28] MBG_95: @tettles he was getting out of control on Moonkin, causing chaos, had to be stopped for a bit
[2:35:28] oakeri: also see if your windows and drivers updates are updated.
[2:35:38] tettles: yeah causing chaos at the top of the meters
[2:35:42] Shragenator: huge ps
[2:36:25] augustmourns: those little guys pump butt
[2:36:38] MBG_95: @tettles or asking for BoP on waycrest Goliath when he didn't need it, sending beam on affix instead of guards LUL was nightmare
[2:36:40] nightbreeze93: good luck zach Sadge
[2:36:58] LordAnomandaris: Is Dorki still juicing details to make boomie look better than it is???
[2:37:14] tettles: I thought SP could pre PWS / Heal DR himself
[2:37:20] tettles: does he die through that?
[2:37:42] x_Scy: tettles that's just 10% dr, even with fade 10% that's lower than a personal of most classes, no?
[2:37:42] oakeri: @zachl_ you can also disable hardware accel in chrome, but i would think this points to video drivers/windows updates
[2:38:03] Razzeu: @oakeri he did
[2:38:10] nightbreeze93: my gamba money is on the nvidia driver
[2:38:21] tettles: @x_Scy think disc lives it with just that as well but im not 100%
[2:38:47] zachl_: ok i think i realize what i did... do monitors effect 3d ?
[2:39:16] zachl_: yes, right?
[2:39:24] Razzeu: no idea Shruge
[2:39:30] x_Scy: maybe disc likes vers more than shadow?
[2:39:38] Razzeu: MONKA this pull
[2:39:41] tettles: disc does run haste vers, that is true
[2:39:45] thetiss_: you guys are crazy
[2:39:46] Razzeu: CLASSIC if i try this on a pug, we are dead
[2:39:55] x_Scy: zachl_ just plugging in a 2nd monitor should have minor, like VERY minor impacts on performance
[2:40:13] nightbreeze93: i don't think the monitor has any effect
[2:40:14] juno_sha: GG
[2:40:16] vScizor: xdd
[2:40:18] Canwestop: Deadge
[2:40:19] Canwestop: xdd
[2:40:21] oakeri: @zachl_ not that i can think of
[2:40:30] zachl_: hmmm okay cause i just installed a 2nd 4k monitor was wondering maybe thats it but idek
[2:40:37] nightbreeze93: your gpu could be blasting 100% without any monitor at all
[2:40:40] Razzeu: bro after the reset im getting rolled too in 28-29s, tf is happening Susge
[2:40:51] augustmourns: cant take cinderbolt volley without frailty/brand up
[2:40:56] Canwestop: !civcheck HEALER?
[2:40:57] Nightbot: HEALER? is 97% civilian.
[2:40:58] x_Scy: zachl_ i'll give you the trust me bro advice and tell you to downgrade your driver to 537.58
[2:41:23] augustmourns: @Razzeu Sanguine OP
[2:41:48] x_Scy: zachl_ if you are a bit tech savvy, you use ddu to remove current driver
[2:41:54] Razzeu: @Razzeu nah no timer wise, like for w/e reason i feel weaker Susge
[2:41:56] Canwestop: sanguine actually beans
[2:42:11] augustmourns: @Razzeu sanguine drains the brain
[2:42:18] Razzeu: 5Head ah
[2:42:22] Canwestop: sanguine drains THIS
[2:42:23] thetiss_: is sanguine streaming?
[2:42:31] augustmourns: 3Head affix
[2:42:57] zachl_: @x_Scy im not any bit tech savvy idek how to downgrade bro
[2:43:00] nightbreeze93: what if it's the windows GPU hardware scheduling DESPAIR
[2:43:04] zachl_: if i knew wat i was doing i wouldnt be in twitch chat
[2:43:25] daabzii: @thetiss_  https://www.twitch.tv/sanguine_ichor
[2:43:29] x_Scy: zachl_ google nvidia driver 537.58, download, install, should be good enough
[2:43:37] thetiss_: @daabzii XD
[2:43:45] daabzii: petkoLol petkoLol petkoLol
[2:43:49] Razzeu: @x_Scy downgrade with no DDU? monkaS
[2:44:07] Vods: No DDU downgrade docLeave
[2:44:24] zachl_: ok so i dont do that got it Cryge
[2:44:25] x_Scy: guys, he will be frightened by the ddu warning and not do anything
[2:44:33] nightbreeze93: the installer technically removes it
[2:44:34] Vods: YEP
[2:44:49] Razzeu: ye but downgrading without DDU, might as well not downgrade at all Shruge
[2:45:01] Razzeu: imo at least Shruge
[2:45:03] IAttackYou: hiii
[2:45:08] Vods: hiii
[2:45:12] thetiss_: damn sanguine is op
[2:45:16] IAttackYou: hi friends hiii
[2:45:29] x_Scy: downgrading without ddu has more chance to work than doing nothing Shruge
[2:45:34] nightbreeze93: even a reinstall is worth a try and we dont have ddu option..
[2:45:37] zachl_: ok ok guys i bring news
[2:45:39] zachl_: its wow
[2:45:43] daabzii: sanguine the new mw monk?
[2:45:53] Razzeu: HOLY wow using GPU?
[2:45:58] zachl_: yea..l.
[2:45:59] daabzii: some serious spot healing
[2:46:00] zachl_: hold on

[2:46:22] zachl_: excuse me ????
[2:46:38] Razzeu: is probably the first time i see
[2:46:40] augustmourns: DPS has to dispel once, immediately gains class consciousness for healers
[2:46:42] x_Scy: zachl_ time for ddu + downgrade my man 4Head
[2:46:42] Razzeu: wow using GPU ICANT
[2:46:50] oddarcade: guys can someone link his weak aura which shows all the mobs casting
[2:46:50] EmElw: vdh threat has to be bugged
[2:47:01] EmElw: not even cap at this point
[2:47:02] zachl_: wow is using fucking 85% of my GPU ???? 4060 ti ????
[2:47:02] Vods: Again could be broken addon @zachl_
[2:47:05] Razzeu: @zachl_ do you have uncapped fps?
[2:47:34] zeph_6: HOLY
[2:47:39] smuggamer1337: baseg
[2:47:39] Shragenator: not the gigachad build lmao
[2:47:43] 르으기르: FB is bugged afaik
[2:47:43] augustmourns: @EmElw i am p sure it has something to do with flame sigil and immo aura not benefitting from tank threat aura
[2:47:44] x_Scy: i feel like people asked uncapped fps before we went down the rabbit hole Prayge
[2:47:56] zeph_6: every time i open dorki stream he's in everbloom moon2T
[2:47:59] Razzeu: @르으기르 how so? PauseChamp
[2:48:01] zachl_: @zachl_ i have none of the fps options clicked
[2:48:16] 르으기르: not FB, fiery sigil
[2:48:23] x_Scy: wdym none clicked, do you have uncapped background fps SUS
[2:48:24] Razzeu: @zachl_ do you normally get more fps ingame than your monitor supports?
[2:48:27] Surefirexp: Did Dorki get the Lego?
[2:48:28] EmElw: surely sigils will create threat out of combat in war within
[2:48:34] nightbreeze93: i am people now HOLY

[2:48:40] EmElw: or s4 PauseChamp
[2:48:49] zachl_: @zachl_ i have 2 4k monitors i just got id imagine its not a monitor issue

[2:49:00] 르으기르: @르으기르 vdk discord says flame sigil's initial hit won't generate threat if someone aggros the mob before sigil goes off

[2:49:32] augustmourns: @르으기르 that is so fucked up
[2:49:36] nightbreeze93: tbh i think wow's default caps at 100fps Sadge
[2:49:45] nightbreeze93: probably not uncapped by default
[2:49:55] x_Scy: zachl_ this is a wild ride, from "i dunno" to "chrome" to some windows processes to "oh it was wow all along" KEKW
[2:49:58] Vods: It should be uncapped
[2:50:02] nightbreeze93: yeah?
[2:50:03] Razzeu: @zachl_ tick the max foreground fps ingame and set it to your main monitor fps, its not THE solution to the issue, but it will help you if lets say you get 400 fps in game but your monitor is 144
[2:50:04] Vods: I get 144 on linux Shruge
[2:50:13] Vods: With way worse specs then zach
[2:50:23] nightbreeze93: no i mean as a default setting, assuming he didn't touch it
[2:50:33] zachl_: @x_Scy ya but now wow, non gpu game is taking 85% of my gpu
[2:50:47] x_Scy: @zachl_ also limit background fps to like 30
[2:50:53] nightbreeze93: tech support is always Painge
[2:51:03] Razzeu: @Vods yep so my thinking is that something in interacting with his stuff and capping his frames to the monitor will help the GPU usage a lot
[2:51:11] Vods: Oh yeah for sure
[2:51:39] Vods: background to 30, foreground to max monitor fps -4 fps
[2:51:50] EmElw: HOLY
[2:51:54] augustmourns: Mmmmm sanguie
[2:51:57] daabzii: @zachl_ i dunno if this is dumb but, can u confirm ur screen is connected to graphic card and not mother board? i had this issue and my screen dp was connected to mother board at start
[2:51:58] gabohunt02: Sanguine besto heal
[2:52:00] Razzeu: @zachl_ cap your frames to your monitor and report back OkaygeBusiness
[2:52:01] smuggamer1337: this ain't the strat
[2:52:15] tettles: is daizr divine storming
[2:52:16] everjaz: new strat
[2:52:27] x_Scy: @tettles 10000%
[2:52:27] EmElw: no he's ethical ret gamer
[2:52:29] zachl_: @daabzii both monitors are in my gpu
[2:52:31] EmElw: i trust
[2:52:31] nightbreeze93: but i don't think it's uncapped Sadge
[2:52:59] nezo_pont: 0 aug meta? Pog
[2:53:13] JustEclecticV1: u dont have divine storm procs with m+ so he divining
[2:53:22] alex_b104: does the pally buffs put them in the meta? lol
[2:53:25] augustmourns: casual 80 mill sanguine healing
[2:53:37] zeph_6: Chatting sanguine stream?
[2:53:48] x_Scy: why shadow tho
[2:53:58] augustmourns: peatSpin
[2:53:59] EmElw: pugs are like 15% better with a ret by default, good class YEP
[2:54:21] JustEclecticV1: @EmElw yet people are racist towards ret sadly
[2:54:39] Vods: Start inviting Frost DKs dorki .. so i can get into higher keys RageyBoom
[2:54:39] rokemon: @x_Scy cant be the fact that shadow is topping the meters or anything Kappa
[2:54:43] Razzeu: Despairge rets need to get score asap if they dont have a team, cause after MDI noone will invite them
[2:54:46] x_Scy: 2nd ret > shadow, clearly YEP
[2:54:54] augustmourns: what does moving the adds away do there?
[2:54:56] dango0n: wont be low key for long
[2:55:00] donkeyu: how
[2:55:04] donkeyu: is spriest op
[2:55:13] Yelolyayla: Survivability on Shadow Priest may be a problem
[2:55:15] nightbreeze93: biceps?
[2:55:17] rokemon: frost dk with legendary spreading dot with howling blast is pretty OP
[2:55:23] zwappes: there are a  couple good ones on EU, but they get declined to every keys
[2:55:23] rokemon: just got the lego dorki
[2:55:24] bez260: Biceps is mostly unholy too
[2:55:24] trentbail23: frost DK just doesnt do any damage and has no utility really. its really sad.
[2:55:33] littymctt: have a buddy who will die playing frost dk
[2:55:34] x_Scy: @x_Scy to be fair, spriest in m+ build gets free aoe in their ST
[2:55:37] nightbreeze93: yeah but i'm pretty sure he keeps up with frost
[2:55:37] dango0n: tell Twicks to get a belt enchant
[2:55:39] oneshotelitee: Go blood dk is way more fun lol
[2:55:40] zaradel_plays: Sideways running drab triggers me for some reason.
[2:55:50] zachl_: ok i changed my background fps to 30 and my foreground to be 140 and my avg usage went from 80 to 50
[2:55:54] zachl_: so were getting there but
[2:55:58] zachl_: where is the other 50% coming from
[2:55:59] augustmourns: unholy stonks will rise soon
[2:56:40] x_Scy: zachl_ if there's no stuttering, you live with 50%, because it could be 200% if there is no stuttering
[2:56:41] EmElw: i think this route should pull more abom and berserkers
[2:56:42] Vods: DDLS upscaling maybe Shruge
[2:56:46] thetiss_: sanguince topping the HPS
[2:56:47] nightbreeze93: 50% doesn't sound like disaster
[2:56:51] hdott52: another bloom sess in the books
[2:56:55] dango0n: Is sanguine the most trash affix or is it bolstering?
[2:57:03] juno_sha: @hdott52
[2:57:06] thetiss_: bolstering
[2:57:18] nightbreeze93: @hdott52 you have no idea Despairge
[2:57:19] zachl_: @x_Scy well that was just wow- gpu still getting 70% used
[2:57:23] Razzeu: @zachl_ GPU are meant to be using high % and 50% is ok, but if u wanna lower it, its probably tied to your graphic settings
[2:57:24] zaradel_plays: @dango0n bolstering is 1000 times worse.
[2:57:30] Samurayny: what class is similar to Rets?
[2:57:41] augustmourns: my gpu usage always shows 0
[2:57:42] zachl_: i mean 50% being just wow
[2:57:43] augustmourns: idk why
[2:57:52] zaradel_plays: @samurayny the dps warrior specs are similar ish
[2:57:57] Vods: I mean 4k wow on a 4060 ... 50% sounds fine Shruge
[2:58:12] nightbreeze93: i think it's still advisable to reinstall driver and perhaps try that nvidia performance thingy
[2:58:14] Razzeu: ^ Shruge

[4:25:32] yeyanow: did you get toruny realm acccess?
[4:25:44] shogunmaster2: the fact that palworld is actually a fun game has alot to do this it i think, most of the fotm games arent that fun/arent that much to do in them
[4:25:46] edsee_xd: balance druid pog
[4:26:04] UndadTV: @BulkSZN miss you huge fan holy fuck

[4:26:53] Schnuwuuu: palworld wasn't able to hook me yet :D
[4:27:03] gretriku: cant let NA's Last Hope get too powerful
[4:27:03] ArcaneSyntax: Palworld is kinda BG3 in that it's been a while since a halfway decent quality version of that thing came out so people flocked to it
[4:27:13] nwall813: @dorki when are are bear keys?
[4:27:51] Schnuwuuu: imo palworld is mainly hype. it has nothing very new. like ark + pokemon. bg3 had so much more
[4:28:05] hdott52: BG3 was in early access for like 3 years though
[4:28:08] edsee_xd: @ArcaneSyntax bg3 is halfway decent? lol what
[4:28:09] shogunmaster2: palworld just isnt polish at all, theres alot to it
[4:28:38] Schnuwuuu: maybe i gotta look at it Hmm
[4:28:48] Hylilan: palworld is minecraft, valheim, rust and pokemon with guns
[4:28:48] ArcaneSyntax: @ArcaneSyntax yes, BG3 is a good game, but it'd been like a decade since a decent game in that format came out.
[4:29:00] Nightbot: dorkiHey Join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/yHFTAZn
[4:29:02] hdott52: i wonder if its' more like a game type, cause most survival build games are similar in polish
[4:29:24] juno_sha: I like rpgs
[4:29:33] edsee_xd: @ArcaneSyntax you probably never heard of dvinity
[4:29:41] hdott52: juno you are an anime weeb now
[4:29:41] nightbreeze93: have you seen enshrouded juno
[4:29:43] Hylilan: literally a game that took all the best parts of popular games and made that shit better

[4:30:09] ArcaneSyntax: @ArcaneSyntax I've played Divinity, it's ehhhh, and it's also nowhere near the kind of thing BG3 is even attempting.
[4:30:11] Hylilan: they deserve to win the world
[4:30:49] edsee_xd: @ArcaneSyntax ah ok, yeah i agree bg3's scope if yuge compared to div, but lets be honest if bg3's bear sex scene thing didn't go viral the normies would've never heard of it
[4:31:50] hdott52: nah, BG3 is high quality those type of games will always expand and pick up fans
[4:31:51] Schnuwuuu: so nice to see dps waiting for the tank to stack every add. Sadge especially with my 460dk it's so hard to get aggro everywhere when pugs insta nuke xdd

[4:32:09] Morayeden: @juno_sha Weird
[4:32:15] juno_sha: Madge
[4:32:19] juno_sha: It was dumb
[4:32:20] Morayeden: It would be a ele main
[4:32:21] juno_sha: to me
[4:32:31] edsee_xd: @juno_sha like the gameplay didn't appeal to you?
[4:32:31] ArcaneSyntax: @Schnuwuuu on lower keys i just bubble when i go ham, that way i don't pull
[4:32:38] gretriku: ele mains are known to have bad taste
[4:32:42] juno_sha: Mostly the gameplay
[4:32:43] Schnuwuuu: @ArcaneSyntax my monk had no bubble xdd
[4:32:49] edsee_xd: @juno_sha yeah that's fair
[4:33:10] juno_sha: If it was like Dragon Age Origins, then i would've liked it more
[4:33:22] ArcaneSyntax: the gameplay of BG3 is the thing i like most about it, it's the story that drags it down imo
[4:33:28] hdott52: yah, bg3 is not for everyone, its very methodical combat
[4:33:34] Morayeden: DAO and BG3 are very similar?
[4:33:49] Schnuwuuu: i thought bg3 was best for its story, it's not?
[4:33:53] Morayeden: Think DAO is based off D&D rules
[4:34:01] edsee_xd: i enjoyed bg3's narrative
[4:34:03] ArcaneSyntax: @Morayeden it's not
[4:34:09] hdott52: DAO is more action oriented
[4:34:15] hdott52: vs bg3
[4:34:24] hdott52: bg3 is more tactical
[4:34:29] edsee_xd: yeap
[4:34:37] ArcaneSyntax: @Schnuwuuu I think it's the weakest element of the game.
[4:34:47] Morayeden: Yeah its not turn based i guess, but I thought Bioware took huge inspiration from their kotor game
[4:35:26] ArcaneSyntax: @Morayeden they did, but it's not strictly like D&D
[4:35:26] hdott52: kotor, wow what a game
[4:35:31] edsee_xd: man that kotor remake is dead
[4:35:33] edsee_xd: thanks for reminding me
[4:35:36] juno_sha: Speaking of bioware, when is a new mass effect coming out?
[4:35:44] edsee_xd: @juno_sha 2045
[4:35:48] juno_sha: Sadge
[4:35:48] gretriku: never hopefully
[4:35:50] ArcaneSyntax: like 2029
[4:35:54] edsee_xd: idk why bioware does this shit
[4:36:02] edsee_xd: stop announcing games that come out 10 years later
[4:36:03] juno_sha: What about Fable? That was a sick game
[4:36:17] ArcaneSyntax: DA4 comes out maybe this year (copium)

[6:57:05] noldan216: The name Kesstickle is pretty ironic considering paladins are eunuchs.
[6:57:19] K4lsdern: HUH

[7:02:32] NoStress15: lol wow that's sick

[7:10:33] ZellieMasters: I think it's my stats but maybe not
[7:10:46] njokkio: @zelliemasters you just need infusion from church man
[7:10:55] Lookmeupz: hahah I feel that. I spent like 30k trying to get my stats and shit right
[7:10:56] epicninja808: ret
[7:10:58] h0urze: boomkin is ass in pugs

[7:11:09] Yuccalyptus: bm hunter is WAY more simple
[7:11:11] smuggamer1337: bm
[7:11:14] flickflackoverduck69: bm hunter
[7:11:19] Drakoclaw111: why is boomkin hard to do good dps on?
[7:11:20] Thowarr: warrior is simplier
[7:11:21] ZellieMasters: Ah yes I think I do need a Priest for PI and I would give them Innervate
[7:11:30] Lookmeupz: BM is boring though
[7:11:31] lqtfps: teach us Senpai @dorki . it is simple but i cant land a good damoooge
[7:11:36] ZellieMasters: peas and carrots
[7:11:38] Chewbaccaw: @ZellieMasters he lied as easily as he breathed
[7:11:40] Hoshma46: fury is simpler than BM
[7:12:16] Chewbaccaw: BM is fun, gotta manage your pets tho
[7:12:17] lqtfps: ok, 1 - gear
[7:12:18] Thowarr: destro lock is pretty brain dead
[7:12:19] lqtfps: 2 - ?
[7:12:23] Chewbaccaw: thats sometimes annoying
[7:12:35] ZellieMasters: I played Arcane mage in Season 1
[7:12:44] Chewbaccaw: my condolences @ZellieMasters
[7:13:02] coquemad: tf this ground doesnt doin dmg
[7:13:07] njokkio: @thowarr honestly this season I feel destro in keys is deceptively tricky
[7:13:12] Hoshma46: with the S3 set bonus for fury it's even simpler than normal
[7:13:27] njokkio: single target, yeah that's cake
[7:13:30] Chewbaccaw: survival hunter chads Sadge
[7:13:53] Fantala: why did the poop on the ground not hurt you there?
[7:14:05] Lookmeupz: I can’t load your raiderio off of your twitch link , could you explain which embellishments you are using
[7:14:34] Drakoclaw111: how do you know when poop is old enough to not hurt
[7:14:54] njokkio: Poop from previous phase is old
[7:15:01] NoStress15: @Lookmeupz just go to raider io website and search dorkibear :P
[7:15:03] jambo_the_nerd: ^
[7:15:21] Hoshma46: yeah when a new phase starts it becomes fine
[7:15:21] discomancer1: when the boss phases into p2, the old poop becomes inactive, if he tries to add poop to the existing poop, that poop is also inactive. However, if he is not adding to the old poop, that new poop is active
[7:15:28] okamishinkt: can you look at the monk gear real quick?

[7:15:43] Miaaoouuw: CoolCat CoolCat footiGasm footiGasm
[7:15:49] ZellieMasters: My AOE is good when I'm allowed time to get my empowerments up with wrath but maybe it's the way the tank is pulling that isn't allowing me to pump like I need to
[7:15:55] Shimorta: meg insane
[7:16:12] Kettos: Why did you played dps on the drood this season??
[7:16:50] Pushingdownthemid: how is MDI practice been going?
[7:17:35] njokkio: Pulsar management is probably what I struggle most with on boomie, but I'm also very lazy with setting up WAs
[7:18:05] Lookmeupz: is the crafted neck better then then the crit mastery neck or even the haste mastery neck out of raid ?
[7:18:07] Risnity: this sounds familiar
[7:18:09] Lynnton: wait who are you playing with in mdi?
[7:18:14] svendrabbit: who are you playing with?
[7:18:26] Pushingdownthemid: Did JR not want to do MDI?

[7:20:06] leifjw: what will goop play instead if not aug?
[7:20:08] GeekyLogger: Gotta say that Sang is complete bullshit this season/with Blizzard's "new" approach to dungeons. Having to do twice t he damage because half the mobs are LT's and chain cast+turret is complete shit. More of Blizz's fuckwit "small pulls are best" philosophy
[7:20:18] goop: @leifjw ur mom

[7:41:05] Pechorin333: @ItsRedRustedLIVE anything you want yo, admittedly rogue has a ton of buttons
[7:41:26] Pechorin333: havoc demon hunter as well if you like the rogue mobility fantasy
[7:41:48] Shimorta: would dfeinitely not call havoc a good starter spec anymore
[7:41:58] Teik1066: it's not really

[7:42:14] marcofellipe69: zugg zugg to win

[7:43:23] Teik1066: Ret is the perfect starter spec in my opinion, rotation is simple so you can be effective early on but it has a ton of utility you can "grow" into and become better with time. There's also the possibility to tank or heal later if you want to try new roles.
[7:43:33] marcofellipe69: ya ret easy to play, a lot of room for growth with utility
[7:43:58] marcofellipe69: but hard to really understand the specs limits as you grow from dps brain to game sense

[9:12:42] marcofellipe69: mage can be played too in either one though, dependsss
[9:14:29] small_doge: Dorki, haven’t swapped to some feral keys brudda?
[9:14:54] 69chacotacobutter: damn hows the moon chicken doin dmg like that
[9:14:55] DigoCapiroto: @K4lsdern its nice to have a breather, cause melees suffered enough on vortex pinacle
[9:15:15] moguymo: what class hits the hardest (not the highest dps)
[9:15:25] patrins: yo this ret is huge, do they stream?
[9:15:27] 69chacotacobutter: they dont make those pug moon chickens like dorki
[9:15:38] small_doge: RIP feral :/
[9:16:00] 69chacotacobutter: whats the most common mistake that pug moonkins are making?
[9:16:04] 69chacotacobutter: do they just like not press starfire
[9:16:16] Jacksprat47: going boomy in low keys
[9:16:24] small_doge: preach
[9:16:25] Dermortis1990: @69chacotacobutter its mostly not moonkins fault. its more like tanks pull too few mobs
[9:16:31] K4lsdern: @DigoCapiroto oh ye for sure
[9:16:32] small_doge: boomy is trash in low keys
[9:17:02] Dermortis1990: that pull on a 20 and mobs die too fast and boomie cant ramp fast enough
[9:17:08] Jacksprat47: ngl you're honestly better off being fucking guardian than boomy in anything below like 23
[9:17:21] 69chacotacobutter: whats like a low key for moonkin
[9:17:24] 69chacotacobutter: anything under 29?
[9:17:28] aERB3: higher keys are just better for balance
[9:17:29] small_doge: hahaha Jack 😅
[9:17:33] discomancer1: NOT IN MY KEY PUG TANK
[9:17:35] discomancer1: NAAAWWWW
[9:17:40] Tarisant: @Jacksprat47 i found this to not really be the case this season, moonkin feels fine even as low as 20
[9:18:17] small_doge: @tarisant still gotta pull big and not play with a DH right?
[9:18:20] Jacksprat47: @Tarisant True, but that does also depend on comp and pull size a lil too
[9:18:25] Naimiria: hey dork xddPeat
[9:18:39] 69chacotacobutter: ive done keys with moonkins tho, doing pretty standard streamer routes and they still dont pump like that
[9:18:41] small_doge: DH deletes mobs in 20s

[9:22:41] 69chacotacobutter: i had a pugkin say one time that his dps was low because he was ccing a lot
[9:23:15] K4lsdern: that's cope but whatever makes him feel better ig
[9:23:53] Dermortis1990: @69chacotacobutter most dmg comes from dots or starfall. just excuses

[11:14:39] Morayeden: @giggz91 Nah
[11:14:54] Morayeden: Heroic adds your chances you would have had from normal and lfr
[11:15:47] YunaxEU: I wish there was a way to see the drop chance after getting so many tokens
[11:16:09] Morayeden: Is it 0.01% or 1%? We will never know
[11:18:01] hucking: does sanguine stream??
[11:18:27] jabarak93: is veng dh a tank for beginners? i wanna start tanking abit
[11:19:05] Morayeden: Bear prob the easiest tank to start, VDh i wouldn't say is a beginner tank, but if you enjoy that spec, def play what your enjoy first
[11:19:26] MajorBenny: right now it is just keep sigil up
[11:19:29] qufad: I think all tanks are relatively easy to pick up
[11:19:45] flockheart: xdd
[11:19:46] Itankarenas: tanking is more about knowledge than anything else
[11:19:49] Jacksprat47: warrior's probably the most straightforward in their defensiveness
[11:19:51] beefbuster: i would say paladin is the easiest to behin with
[11:19:53] i_cassius: @YunaxEU there is a macro try google
[11:20:01] Shimorta: keystone terrorism priest edition
[11:20:07] Shimorta: which flavor of priest tho? both?
[11:21:58] Panix91: why do you pull that priest into the boss and not with the grp before the boss?
[11:22:41] nerfmageffs: @qufad phahahahahahha you have to be kidding dude. I play all specs  and tank is by far harderst role in game
[11:23:03] Morayeden: All specs?! HOLY
[11:23:09] kondelol: HOLY
[11:23:15] Jacksprat47: ah yes please stand in the gold glowy healing circle I'm placing on the gold floor and avoid the gold orbs k thx Kappa
[11:23:19] rahmine: last season drudi was definitely harders :d
[11:23:24] Starlight: By far the hardest is kinda troll to say. Healing is hard in high keys and far harder in raid than tanking.
[11:23:42] DahFreak: @qufad xdd
[11:24:02] TheAmazingSalvio: @nerfmageffs mechanically they are all pretty straightforward it is everything else that you have to do aside from your rotation that makes tanking difficult
[11:24:03] reppap: @nerfmageffs that's some cope
[11:24:10] Panix91: ty
[11:24:22] babajoda: FirstTimeChadder
[11:24:23] nerfmageffs: @Starlight I bet u play only healers
[11:24:37] Starlight: I play both tank and healer.
[11:24:57] Morayeden: Raid tanking do be resident sleeper
[11:25:17] Jacksprat47: tanking's the easiest role if you have a decent group, just also the most deadly if you fuck it up
[11:25:23] hucking: i play rumble
[11:25:38] Jacksprat47: @hucking nah hots is where it's at
[11:25:50] chronnnooo: shadow priest finally broken again?
[11:25:55] hucking: hearthstone is by far the hardest Kappa
[11:26:04] klapp_: I think that guy was talking about the fact if a spec is hard to play. Don't think its unreasonable to say most tank specs aren't hard to play but tanking itself doesn't just come down to what the rotation is
[11:26:49] greaterlock: the shotcaller is the hardest role
[11:27:17] dominopomino: I think what perceived as difficult is not the same for everyone
[11:28:00] fdb33: dorki u playing double priest for incorp? Or just experimenting/doesnt matter comp wise that much
[11:28:13] Morayeden: Tanking has a lot of external externalities that make it hard, but the specs themselves, easy to pick up for the most part.
[11:28:17] Jacksprat47: yeah apparently someone in my guild finds demo lock hard somehow
[11:28:24] fdb33: true and based

[11:48:34] nightSkyy: I feel Augs in pugs is just a meme. Probably better in somewhat organized groups, or maybe very high keys where they know wtf they are doing
[11:48:39] MoonBlastx: @dorki link the cc order aura plssss
[11:48:39] Not_aFox: drums on a 29 HOLY
[11:48:41] misterworldhide: growl sandbag typical
[11:48:42] tr1plus: augs are also squshy AF
[11:48:44] CHRD0: no lust?
[11:48:44] qufad: I guess most augs are miserable playing hte spec as well
[11:48:45] julian_fmv: more dmg yeah tell them to cast Ebon might harder jaja
[11:48:45] Ventorpoe: if i was still healin, i wouldnt let an aug into my key with a healer trinket on
[11:48:46] FareweII_: i personally don't like not being 100% responcible for my damage as a dps with aug
[11:48:47] bug_legacy: Has vengeance claimed the tank crown or is prot pala good in some dungeons/comps? (at the highest levels)
[11:48:51] Seraak: also 90% of augs in pugs are just absolut dogshit
[11:48:53] bluhblaah: aug is best class to play if wanna get carried with score
[11:48:55] sh1n_gaming: then how come augs are still one of the highest rank for M+ runs? (according to raider io)

[11:51:25] saintaleks: can u swap weapons mid key? bcs some ppl in my raid told that u are

[12:11:34] Brxdix: the people here talking about their 18-22. ofc even in pugs people kick, cc and stuff, just dont in lower keys
[12:11:36] sh1n_gaming: THAT should be possible considering we have something like that for Shadowlands raid, Sanctum of Domination, Roh-Kalo

[12:12:48] cassiopeia321: sometimes when i'm playing other games i miss weakauras

[12:12:57] Nougatmums: May I ask your opinion on hekili? Is it good or bad for the game?
[12:13:04] bug_legacy: Dorki is trying to offload coding to chat.
[12:13:05] Razzeu: SNIFFA can you show stats one sec?
[12:13:13] Minarva: It's seriously hard to raid the last 3 bosses in mythic without a WA tbh.
[12:13:22] sh1n_gaming: @zamow1994 yep, I would like M+ to have only buffs like Torghast!
[12:13:24] Brxdix: @mehdijojo1 why? my own stats have nothing to do with my statement. I myself play mostly around 22,23 so I know what people talk about. if you go 25+ it gets WAY better, no?
[12:13:33] Razzeu: ty peepoHappy
[12:13:56] Luvyana: hekili is great, some specs actually works perfectly, ret is a good example, casters not so much
[12:14:11] stiknork: ill take the WA, the real dystopia is the present where no dps player ever wants to call a single mechanic and i snap and go nonverbal after 5 keys
[12:14:12] Luvyana: but will still help you learn the class faster than without prob
[12:14:13] Seraak: fyrakk shield phase without a WA is fking impossible

[12:56:10] truffledorewow: Yeah sucks like i can heal easily but moment people start missing interupts etc it goes to shit real quick
[12:56:16] reshi91: is going to 26 with Cheat death trolling @dorki ?
